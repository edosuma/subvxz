I'll set these down.
Then I'll show you through the house.

01:00.233 --> 01:04.066
You didn't have to wait outside.
It's ok, fella.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.400
"I don't mind if I do.

01:08.166 --> 01:09.734
Nice place you got here."

01:10.266 --> 01:13.867
Thank you. Can I offer you something?
Coffee? Tea?

01:13.934 --> 01:15.367
Scraps from last night's dinner?

01:15.433 --> 01:19.133
"Oh, you're pulling my tail. Ha ha!"

01:19.200 --> 01:21.633
You're too old for imaginary friends.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.934
I wasn't talking to myself.
I was talking to the dog.

01:26.834 --> 01:30.834
Naomi Birch talked to woodpeckers.
A thousand volts a day stopped that.

01:32.166 --> 01:35.934
Isn't he adorable? He was lost.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.700
I'll keep him until I can find his owner.

01:37.767 --> 01:41.500
Only if you find his owner before Dorothy
gets home. She hates dogs.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Hello.

01:43.066 --> 01:46.266
Oh, well, look at the cute
little puppy dog.

01:46.333 --> 01:47.734
Hello there, honey.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.800
Oh, he likes me.
He must be a male.

01:54.667 --> 01:57.166
Then you don't mind if he stays here
till I find his owner?

01:57.233 --> 02:00.533
Mind? Of course I mind.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.967
You can't keep that filthy beast
in my house.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.400
I thought you said he was cute.

02:06.467 --> 02:11.200
He is, but a dog belongs outdoors
where he can roam

02:11.266 --> 02:14.367
and lick himself in the privacy
of his own doghouse.

02:15.300 --> 02:19.033
He won't be any trouble. I'll keep him
in my room till I find his owner.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.467
You won't even know he's here.

02:20.533 --> 02:25.333
Oh, well, I suppose it's ok,
but Dorothy has to say it's ok, too.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.266
-Oh, thanks, Blanche.
-If he lifts his leg in this house,

02:28.333 --> 02:29.700
I'm rubbing your nose in it.

02:30.633 --> 02:31.934
That seems fair.

02:33.967 --> 02:35.500
"Bye, auntie Blanche.

02:36.133 --> 02:37.867
Bye, auntie Sophia."

02:38.333 --> 02:39.567
Come on, handsome.

02:39.834 --> 02:43.567
If she was my age,
she'd be locked up at shady pines

02:43.633 --> 02:45.500
making boats out of popsicle sticks.

02:48.533 --> 02:50.667
I've had it.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.300
The past few days,

02:52.367 --> 02:55.700
I have been turned down for every
available part-time job

02:55.767 --> 02:58.500
in Dade County that didn't involve
selling cocaine.

03:02.567 --> 03:05.967
That's unfair.
They shouldn't be allowed to do this

03:06.033 --> 03:07.367
to a fine teacher like you.

03:07.433 --> 03:11.133
Well, it's part of the experimental
year-round school system.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.867
Teachers are required
to take a 10-week leave.

03:13.934 --> 03:15.700
My 10 weeks are now.

03:15.767 --> 03:18.433
You should've taken the job
I wanted you to take.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.734
Ma, you wanted me to be a nun.

03:22.967 --> 03:25.500
Right. It's steady work,
they supply the uniform,

03:25.567 --> 03:26.934
and you're married to God.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.800
At least he's home every night.

03:34.166 --> 03:37.567
It's time you reconsidered
working at the museum with me.

03:37.633 --> 03:40.000
We've had that conversation.

03:40.066 --> 03:44.333
All I know about museums is you shouldn't
eat the veal in the cafeteria.

03:44.934 --> 03:48.033
You can't find a job,
and you need the money.

03:48.100 --> 03:51.066
-It might be fun working together.
-Well--

03:51.133 --> 03:56.200
I'm not taking no for an answer.
I'll arrange an interview tomorrow.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.600
(woof woof)

03:59.166 --> 04:01.200
-What was that?
-Rose brought a dog home

04:01.266 --> 04:02.367
from the supermarket.

04:02.433 --> 04:05.367
Couldn't she just get stew meat
like she usually does?

04:08.967 --> 04:11.233
Dorothy, now don't be upset.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.867
The poor little thing was lost.
He followed me home.

04:13.934 --> 04:16.300
You drive to the market.

04:16.367 --> 04:18.500
How did he follow you home,
in a taxi?

04:19.500 --> 04:23.500
He looked so hungry and sad.
I couldn't just leave him there.

04:23.567 --> 04:27.734
-I hunted three hours for his owner.
-I hate dogs, Rose.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.967
Oh, Dorothy, come on.
Nobody hates dogs.

04:31.533 --> 04:33.834
Oh, please, just for the night,
I promise.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.867
Please, auntie Dorothy?

04:37.567 --> 04:40.600
I won't be any trouble. Please?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.967
All right, but just for the night.

04:44.033 --> 04:48.300
Oh, thank you, auntie Dorothy.
Thank you. Thank you.

04:48.367 --> 04:49.667
Thank you.

04:50.867 --> 04:53.767
-Do you believe this?
-Nah. I saw her lips move.

05:05.767 --> 05:08.233
Uh, I took several
art courses in college,

05:08.300 --> 05:11.333
and I've also substituted
in art appreciation classes

05:11.400 --> 05:13.033
in the public school system.

05:13.633 --> 05:14.633
Huh?

05:15.500 --> 05:18.367
Sir, Dorothy was telling you about
her background.

05:18.433 --> 05:20.600
I'm a little distracted.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.967
It's not every day
a man comes home at lunch

05:23.033 --> 05:24.900
to find his best friend
in bed with his wife.

05:25.667 --> 05:29.066
I'm so sorry.
That must've been quite a shock.

05:29.133 --> 05:32.200
It was. Arthur's never
come home at lunch before.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.600
He caught me red-handed.

05:37.066 --> 05:38.300
Now, where were we?

05:38.834 --> 05:41.533
We were talking about art.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.600
The thing we hang on the wall here.

05:43.667 --> 05:44.900
What about it?

05:44.967 --> 05:47.600
Dorothy knows a great deal about it.

05:47.667 --> 05:50.000
She studied in Rome
and lectured in Paris,

05:50.066 --> 05:54.333
and she has a keen eye for color and light
and form.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.467
She's always the first
to compliment my wardrobe.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.467
Blanche thinks highly of you.

06:00.533 --> 06:03.734
She's dropping my resume
at the Vatican this afternoon.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.367
Pardon me?

06:07.800 --> 06:11.533
That's a little joke to ease the tension
of the moment.

06:11.600 --> 06:16.200
Right. Right. I tried to think of
something funny to say

06:16.266 --> 06:17.734
when art walked in on us.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.300
Standing there in my shorts,
nothing came to mind.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.300
Mr. Allen.

06:26.333 --> 06:27.700
Mr. Allen.

06:27.767 --> 06:30.867
-Does Dorothy get the job or not?
-Oh, sure, I don't care.

06:32.400 --> 06:36.467
Thank you, Mr. Allen.
I hope I can live up to your expectations.

06:44.133 --> 06:46.133
Come on, sweetheart.
That's a boy.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.467
What are you doing up so early?

06:48.533 --> 06:50.734
Never mind that. It's been over a week.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.600
What's that mutt still doing here?

06:52.667 --> 06:55.467
I did promise to take him
to the pound yesterday,

06:55.533 --> 06:58.967
but he was ill. I'm worried.

06:59.033 --> 07:00.533
Don't worry, it was a hangover.

07:01.834 --> 07:04.166
-What?
-From the sherry.

07:04.233 --> 07:07.633
You gave the dog sherry?
That's terrible.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.533
I had a few sips
while I was rinsing out my underwear...

07:12.000 --> 07:14.533
a thing I do Mondays
and Thursdays only.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.734
The dog walks in, looks at me,

07:17.800 --> 07:21.000
and it's your uncle Aldo's face
begging me for a drink.

07:22.633 --> 07:26.834
I give the mutt a swallow,
but he doesn't stop, like your uncle.

07:28.266 --> 07:31.667
We sing a little Puccini, stretch on the
couch, and take a nap.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.734
A very pleasant afternoon.

07:36.266 --> 07:38.667
Rose, the dog is drooling
on my foot.

07:39.767 --> 07:41.667
You say that like it's a bad thing.

07:41.734 --> 07:46.333
We had an agreement
that the dog would be gone by now.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.667
Just one more day.

07:48.734 --> 07:52.166
I know I'll find the owner.
I have posters all over the neighborhood.

07:52.233 --> 07:55.500
One more day,
or I'll get rid of the dog myself.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.834
I'll take him out to the lanai.

07:58.700 --> 08:01.066
Come on, sweetheart,
come on.

08:03.166 --> 08:04.567
Auntie Dorothy.

08:05.800 --> 08:06.867
Lighten up.

08:08.633 --> 08:10.800
-Morning.
-Good morning, auntie Blanche.

08:10.867 --> 08:13.166
Oh! The pup's still here.

08:13.233 --> 08:16.667
One more day, unless ma decides
to take him bar hopping.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.600
How come you're dressed so early?

08:20.667 --> 08:23.166
I'm going in early

08:23.233 --> 08:26.700
to get the press list information
ready before lunch.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.767
You're such a treasure.
I hope Mr. Allen appreciates you.

08:29.834 --> 08:32.767
After a week,
you know almost as much

08:32.834 --> 08:34.600
about running that museum as I do.

08:34.667 --> 08:38.333
It's a museum. What's to know?
You bang nails, hang pictures.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.834
Any idiot could do that.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.166
Stop bragging, ma.

08:41.233 --> 08:43.433
You're only saying that
'cause I'm your daughter.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.834
I'm very proud
of the job you're doing.

08:46.900 --> 08:49.333
(telephone rings)

08:50.367 --> 08:51.367
Hello.

08:52.367 --> 08:53.633
Just a minute.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.633
-Mr. Allen on the phone.
-Oh.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.934
He's never called me at home before.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.500
And he's not now.
It's for Dorothy.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.500
Oh.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.133
Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Allen.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.467
Oh. Well, thank you.

09:10.266 --> 09:11.834
Thank you again.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.633
Well, thank you very much.

09:14.133 --> 09:17.433
Very sweet of you to call. Yes.
Thank you so much.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.600
I'll see you later. Bye-bye.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.600
What did he want?

09:22.667 --> 09:26.266
He wanted to thank me
for my work on the Hotchkiss project.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.166
That's lovely.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.667
Just lovely...

09:31.834 --> 09:34.400
especially since there wasn't that much
work involved.

09:35.266 --> 09:38.033
It's 8 a.m., what are you
doing with the sherry?

09:38.100 --> 09:41.433
Don't worry. I'm not going to drink it.
I'm just hiding it from the dog.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.433
You expect me to believe that?

09:56.734 --> 09:58.734
Promise me you won't drive.

10:05.066 --> 10:09.400
-Dorothy? Look who I found.
-What are you doing here?

10:09.467 --> 10:11.700
-I brought your lunch.
-Thank you.

10:11.767 --> 10:13.834
You didn't have to come down here.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.967
It gave me an excuse
to put my teeth in.

10:20.066 --> 10:22.233
As long as you're here,
would you like a tour?

10:22.300 --> 10:25.233
If I wanna look at pictures,
I go to fotomat.

10:26.133 --> 10:29.000
Rose brought me.
She's waiting outside with the dog.

10:29.066 --> 10:32.467
You ever stick your head
out a car window doing 50?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.100
What a rush.

10:38.066 --> 10:42.000
Hello. And who do we have here?

10:42.066 --> 10:46.567
My mother, Mrs. Sophia Petrillo.
This is Mr. Allen.

10:46.633 --> 10:49.100
Pleased to meet you.

10:49.166 --> 10:51.467
What brings you to our humble home?

10:53.934 --> 10:55.066
Is he gay?

10:59.400 --> 11:01.400
Come on, honey,
I'll walk you to the car.

11:01.467 --> 11:03.200
Goodbye, Mrs. Petrillo.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.600
Sorry you couldn't
experience our museum.

11:07.133 --> 11:10.600
I'd love for you to see
my most prized acquisition.

11:10.900 --> 11:15.233
-A magnificent pair of Gauguin's.
-What are you, a pervert?

11:16.567 --> 11:20.133
I was married for 45 years
and never saw my husband's Gauguin's.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.467
I almost forgot why I came to talk to you.

11:33.066 --> 11:36.700
-It's about the banquet.
-Don't worry about a thing.

11:36.767 --> 11:39.633
I love to throw a party.
You just leave everything to me.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.967
Actually, Blanche, I've decided to leave
everything to Dorothy.

11:43.600 --> 11:48.233
-Excuse me?
-Dorothy's arranging everything.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.033
You won't have to do anything.

11:50.333 --> 11:53.367
That way, you'll have your time free
to devote to the exhibition.

11:53.433 --> 11:57.667
But the banquet...
I'd always assumed I'd be handling it.

11:57.734 --> 12:01.033
You were, before we found Dorothy.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.266
Have her see me when she gets back.

12:06.133 --> 12:08.633
(ring)

12:11.033 --> 12:13.400
Hello. Dorothy isn't here.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.166
She was arrested
on a morals charge this morning.

12:18.467 --> 12:20.667
You just never know, do you?
Have a nice day.

12:49.233 --> 12:52.367
Ma, give me a break.
The digel's on the bottom shelf.

13:05.800 --> 13:06.800
You!

13:07.867 --> 13:10.000
Come on. That does it.
Come on. Out!

13:10.066 --> 13:14.867
Come on. Come on. Out!
Out! Right now!

13:19.166 --> 13:21.333
Come on. This isn't fair.

13:21.400 --> 13:26.934
I'm not falling for those big sad eyes,
floppy ears and wet nose.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.400
Last time I did,
it ended in divorce.

13:31.066 --> 13:33.567
And Stan couldn't even
catch a Frisbee in his teeth.

13:35.467 --> 13:39.800
Oh, listen. Honey,
it's not a personal thing.

13:40.633 --> 13:44.400
I don't hate you.
I once had a dog.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.100
A Schnauzer named Wawa.

13:48.233 --> 13:52.133
That sounds strange,
but my daughter was only 2

13:52.200 --> 13:54.100
when she named him during a walk.

13:54.533 --> 13:59.367
I figured between that and number one,
wawa was the hands-down winner.

14:00.834 --> 14:05.433
He was the greatest dog in the world,
present company excluded.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.700
I loved that dog.
He was always with me.

14:08.767 --> 14:12.033
I thought I'd never be able
to get along without him.

14:13.033 --> 14:14.633
Then one day, he died.

14:15.433 --> 14:17.433
I cried for a week.

14:17.867 --> 14:21.467
I decided then I would never, ever
go through that again.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.734
So you see... oh, my God.
I just spilled my guts

14:25.800 --> 14:27.667
to someone who drinks out of a toilet.

14:29.633 --> 14:32.500
I'm sorry. You're out.

14:32.567 --> 14:35.000
One Wawa in my life was enough.

14:39.467 --> 14:41.734
Look, I have had it
with that disgusting dog.

14:41.800 --> 14:45.066
I've tolerated him as long as I can.
He's got to go.

14:45.133 --> 14:47.000
-But, Dorothy--
-No buts, Rose.

14:47.734 --> 14:52.600
-I'll need a few more days.
-A few more days, and that's it.

14:53.266 --> 14:54.500
Get me a doggy bone.

14:55.467 --> 14:57.867
I don't know, Dorothy.
I don't think you deserve one.

15:01.934 --> 15:05.300
Rose, not for me.
It's to lure that mutt out of my room.

15:05.367 --> 15:07.433
That's ok. I'll get him out.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.934
Boy, aunt Dorothy's
certainly a grouch.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.567
Oh, you couldn't sleep, either, huh?

15:19.500 --> 15:21.867
No. I guess it must be
the knife in my back.

15:26.567 --> 15:27.567
Come again?

15:28.266 --> 15:32.400
I wasn't going to say anything,
but I won't sleep until I do.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.533
I feel you've backed me into a corner.

15:35.934 --> 15:39.033
When that happens, I fight like a wildcat.

15:40.066 --> 15:41.400
Unless I've drunk too much.

15:41.467 --> 15:44.667
Then I slide down the wall
and make love on the carpet.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.200
Blanche, what are you talking about?

15:52.200 --> 15:56.066
You stole the closing banquet
of the art show I put together.

15:56.133 --> 15:58.567
I didn't steal it.

15:58.633 --> 16:00.367
Mr. Allen assigned it to me.

16:00.433 --> 16:06.467
And why should he give it to you?
I've been working there for five years.

16:06.533 --> 16:10.567
I've been wearing low-cut blouses
and picking up pencils off the floor.

16:12.033 --> 16:14.834
He gropes me at the annual
Christmas party.

16:15.567 --> 16:18.467
And they picked Sandra Day O'Connor
over you?

16:19.834 --> 16:22.033
I'm not taking this sitting down.

16:22.433 --> 16:25.100
When it comes to art,
you cannot hold a candle to me,

16:25.166 --> 16:28.934
so give me back my banquet.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.467
Mr. Allen gave me that banquet,

16:31.533 --> 16:35.567
and I'm taking charge
regardless of your childish insecurities!

16:35.633 --> 16:39.700
-Childish? Who are you calling childish?
-Who are you calling a back-stabber?

16:39.767 --> 16:43.100
I think this fellow better
stick around awhile.

16:43.166 --> 16:45.533
-Get rid of him.
-I think he's getting the flu.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.667
Who cares?

16:48.867 --> 16:50.367
Don't explain, Rose.

16:50.433 --> 16:53.100
I used to live with
a couple of bitches myself.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.900
-Dorothy, is Blanche around?
-No. She hasn't come in yet.

17:06.967 --> 17:10.100
Let's discuss the banquet.
How's everything?

17:10.166 --> 17:12.834
Fine. She doesn't suspect a thing.

17:12.900 --> 17:19.100
I can't wait until she finds out
the banquet is in honor of her good work.

17:19.166 --> 17:20.233
I can't, either.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.033
I'd like you to look at my speech
for Blanche's party.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.066
When it's done,
I'd like to take a look at it.

17:25.133 --> 17:26.934
I'd be happy to, Mr. Allen.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.133
"I'd be happy to, Mr. Allen."

17:29.767 --> 17:33.033
Aren't we licking boots
a little early this morning?

17:34.066 --> 17:35.967
I had a light breakfast.

17:40.033 --> 17:42.633
-Here's your mail.
-Why don't you just tell me what's in it?

17:43.266 --> 17:46.867
-What?
-Haven't you already steamed it open?

17:46.934 --> 17:50.000
I have work to get done before lunch.

17:50.367 --> 17:53.734
Don't let little, ineffectual,
insignificant me

17:53.800 --> 17:55.934
-get between you and your work.
-Thank you.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.467
I wouldn't want to come between your lips
and Mr. Allen's behind.

18:02.367 --> 18:04.834
Blanche, that does it, that does it,
I've had it.

18:04.900 --> 18:08.967
Until we started working together,
you were my best friend.

18:09.033 --> 18:11.834
The reason we were such good friends
was because you trusted me.

18:11.900 --> 18:16.567
Now you think
I'd stab you in the back.

18:16.633 --> 18:18.800
I am not that person.

18:18.867 --> 18:22.166
Blanche, I am still your best friend...

18:22.600 --> 18:24.300
whether or not you think so.

18:32.767 --> 18:34.033
Dorothy, I...

18:35.533 --> 18:37.700
I've been acting like such a fool.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.367
I don't know what got into me.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.700
I know you'd never
hide anything behind my back.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.100
Please forgive me, Dorothy.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.233
Please, Dorothy.

18:53.567 --> 18:54.867
Please, please.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.800
You really hurt my feelings.

18:58.100 --> 19:02.567
-I don't know.
-It's tearing me up. I'm a mess.

19:02.633 --> 19:05.367
You can't tell from the way I look,
but it's true.

19:07.433 --> 19:08.433
Oh...

19:08.900 --> 19:11.433
Ok, Blanche. I forgive you.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.533
Oh...

19:16.066 --> 19:19.800
Dorothy, I've got the...
thing I want you to look over.

19:20.166 --> 19:22.500
I'll look at it later.

19:22.567 --> 19:25.266
So, Blanche, where should we
have lunch?

19:26.467 --> 19:28.900
How about that new pizza place
on the corner?

19:28.967 --> 19:30.266
Great!

19:31.133 --> 19:32.934
-Dorothy?
-Yes, Blanche?

19:33.867 --> 19:35.967
What was that thing
Mr. Allen gave you?

19:37.033 --> 19:39.667
-What thing?
-That thing in your drawer.

19:39.734 --> 19:44.433
-Oh, that thing. It's nothing. Believe me.
-Let me see.

19:44.500 --> 19:48.633
You know something? I'm hungry.
Let's get that pizza now.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.467
It's 9:15. I don't want pizza.
Let me see it.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.467
I'm sorry, Blanche. You can't.

19:54.533 --> 19:57.433
-Why?
-Because.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.667
-Why?
-It's none of your business.

20:01.767 --> 20:02.900
None of my business.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.500
Before you came to work here,

20:06.567 --> 20:09.600
everything was my business.
Show me that paper!

20:09.667 --> 20:11.533
I'm sorry, Blanche. I can't.

20:12.166 --> 20:17.867
You back-stabbing jezebel.
I demand you show me that paper!

20:17.934 --> 20:19.900
I'm sorry. Flattery won't work.

20:22.266 --> 20:26.166
I'll tell you what won't work,
you and me in the same office.

20:26.800 --> 20:30.900
Stealing that banquet was bad enough,
but hiding things, you've gone too far.

20:31.233 --> 20:37.433
If you want this job that bad,
then you can have it. I quit!

20:50.734 --> 20:51.734
Gin!

20:54.800 --> 20:56.066
Aren't you mad?

20:56.600 --> 20:58.266
No. How about another hand?

20:58.333 --> 21:00.467
No. If you don't get mad,
it's no fun.

21:01.834 --> 21:04.367
-You still upset about Blanche?
-Yes, ma.

21:04.433 --> 21:07.433
Tell her the cockamamie banquet
is for her.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.100
I can't. I was sworn to secrecy.

21:11.066 --> 21:14.000
-Hi, Blanche.
-Eat dirt and die, trash.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.300
-Just hold it right there, Blanche.
-Stay out of this.

21:20.834 --> 21:23.600
They're throwing that banquet
in your honor.

21:23.667 --> 21:26.233
-What?
-It was a secret.

21:26.300 --> 21:27.700
Your secret, not mine.

21:29.333 --> 21:30.734
Is this true?

21:31.467 --> 21:32.633
Yes, it is.

21:32.700 --> 21:35.700
Now that you feel like the dirt you wanted
my daughter to eat...

21:36.500 --> 21:38.967
I'll go have a nice hard candy.

21:42.900 --> 21:43.900
Dorothy, I...

21:45.300 --> 21:46.767
I don't know what to say.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.533
-I understand.
-Oh, no, you don't.

21:51.367 --> 21:56.367
See, I used to think
I was a miracle worker,

21:56.433 --> 22:00.300
then you came along and learned my job
in less than a week, and...

22:00.767 --> 22:03.100
I realized any idiot can do what I do.

22:03.166 --> 22:07.433
And you were afraid you couldn't find
the right words to apologize.

22:11.433 --> 22:13.867
There are no right words, Dorothy.

22:15.633 --> 22:18.567
Words cannot ease the pain
I've inflicted on you.

22:19.300 --> 22:21.500
I want to make it up to you.

22:22.033 --> 22:26.200
I want to give you something personal,
something from the heart...

22:26.834 --> 22:30.800
the most beautiful thing I own
to the most beautiful person I know.

22:31.734 --> 22:34.934
I guess that would be
my emerald earrings.

22:35.934 --> 22:37.700
I'm sure as hell not giving you those.

22:39.800 --> 22:44.133
I do want to give you something special
and personal.

22:44.900 --> 22:47.834
How about a personal check
for $75?

22:48.433 --> 22:51.867
On the bottom I'll write,
because I was a big fat jerk.

22:52.767 --> 22:55.433
-I don't want your check.
-Dorothy, please.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.767
I'm trying desperately to say I'm sorry.

22:58.834 --> 23:01.967
I'll take it, but I won't cash it.

23:02.233 --> 23:07.166
I'll keep it as a reminder
for the next time you behave like a jerk.

23:10.900 --> 23:14.400
Can you pretend to be surprised
at that banquet?

23:14.467 --> 23:17.767
Of course. I pretended to be a virgin
half a dozen times.

23:23.033 --> 23:26.467
I've got great news.
I found the dog's owner.

23:26.533 --> 23:29.066
How did you know it was his owner?

23:29.133 --> 23:33.467
He recognized him, and the dog came
when he called him.

23:33.533 --> 23:38.734
That's wonderful.
I'm so glad he found his owner.

23:39.700 --> 23:43.200
-Dorothy, are you crying?
-No,

23:43.266 --> 23:45.467
I just have something in my eye.

23:45.533 --> 23:48.533
That's dog love in your eyes.

23:50.500 --> 23:54.734
All right, I admit it. I love dogs.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.967
It breaks my heart
that that dog is gone.

23:58.033 --> 24:01.133
I know. I felt the same way.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.033
That's why I stopped
at the animal shelter.

24:04.100 --> 24:06.800
Come on in, guys! Come on, fellas!

24:15.000 --> 24:19.667
(theme music playing)
