05:22.910 --> 05:24.243
I think exhaustion.

05:24.311 --> 05:27.714
Broyles told me to take
the day, rest up.

05:27.781 --> 05:28.982
What are you
doing here?

05:29.049 --> 05:31.384

05:31.452 --> 05:32.485

to get me permission

05:47.768 --> 05:49.335

so I can cross over

05:49.402 --> 05:50.436

universe.

05:50.504 --> 05:52.438
Why would you want
to cross over?

05:52.505 --> 05:56.275
Because I think the machine is
my best chance of getting home.

05:56.343 --> 05:57.676

05:57.744 --> 05:59.779

06:02.082 --> 06:05.217
Walternate is an
untrustworthy son of a bitch

for sending

06:07.687 --> 06:09.688
shapeshifters
to our universe.

06:09.756 --> 06:11.523
So what makes you think
that he'll help you?

06:11.591 --> 06:16.395
I really don't have
any other choice.

06:16.462 --> 06:18.496
Okay, in any case,

06:18.564 --> 06:20.865
Broyles isn't gonna let you
near that bridge.

06:20.933 --> 06:22.500
I mean, you may have gained
some trust here,

06:22.567 --> 06:25.136
but to him, you're still
an unknown entity.

06:25.203 --> 06:26.136
Besides, Peter,

06:26.204 --> 06:28.005
they don't know
that you exist.

06:28.072 --> 06:31.141
And Walternate is their
Secretary of Defense.

06:31.209 --> 06:34.979
I mean, how are you gonna
get to him at the D.O.D.?

06:39.317 --> 06:40.551
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:40.618 --> 06:41.752

07:11.849 --> 07:13.650
It's Walter's
portal device--

07:13.718 --> 07:16.119
the one he used
to cross over in 1985.

07:16.187 --> 07:17.354
That's at the bottom
of Reiden Lake.

07:17.421 --> 07:18.688
Well, maybe where
you're from,

07:18.756 --> 07:20.523

recovered it years ago.

And you just happened
to have this handy?

07:25.128 --> 07:27.196

about crossing over myself,

07:27.264 --> 07:28.530

07:28.598 --> 07:29.965
Well, what do you even
need Walter's device for

07:30.033 --> 07:31.901

find out what
the shapeshifters are after.

07:38.141 --> 07:40.643
See if I can expose
Walternate's entire agenda.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.312
Peter's just
given us a way in.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.247
Whoa, whoa. No, that's not
at all what we're about to do.

07:44.315 --> 07:46.049

you guys are dealing

07:46.117 --> 07:47.884
with real and present dangers
from the other side,

07:47.952 --> 07:49.486
but if we go over there
and you get busted,

07:49.554 --> 07:50.654
there's no way
that Walternate's

07:50.722 --> 07:51.888
not gonna think
that I'm involved.

07:51.956 --> 07:53.256
I'm gonna lose
the best chance that I have

07:53.324 --> 07:55.125
to get back to my timeline,
to my people.

07:55.193 --> 07:59.061

11:55.452 --> 11:57.420
Dunham.

11:57.488 --> 11:59.055
<i>I was able to get</i>
<i>the equipment.</i>

11:59.123 --> 12:00.323
<i>I'll meet you</i>
<i>at the theater.</i>

12:00.390 --> 12:02.825
- Great.
- We'll see you there.

12:02.893 --> 12:05.394
Now, what makes you so sure
that there's a soft spot

12:05.462 --> 12:06.929
between universes
in this place?

12:06.997 --> 12:10.633
Well, we've
used it before...

12:10.700 --> 12:12.334
In another timeline.

12:17.639 --> 12:20.875
We're still
about 40 miles out.

12:23.578 --> 12:26.982
It's fine. We've still
got plenty of range.

12:38.663 --> 12:40.364
You all right?

12:40.431 --> 12:42.366
Yeah, I'm okay.

12:42.433 --> 12:44.268
You know, you really
don't have to be here.

12:44.335 --> 12:46.002
No, we have
an arrangement.

12:46.070 --> 12:48.138
If something happens
and you two can't get back,

12:48.206 --> 12:50.707
<i>I have to be here</i>
<i>to let Broyles know.</i>

12:50.775 --> 12:52.309
<i>So this look about right?</i>

12:56.281 --> 12:59.751
Yeah, you look good.

12:59.818 --> 13:03.321
Okay. You're clear
on everything, right?

13:03.389 --> 13:05.223
What you need to do?

13:05.291 --> 13:07.793
<i>Are you ready?</i>

13:16.504 --> 13:18.038
Just out of
curiosity, um...

13:18.106 --> 13:20.440
If this thing closes while
I'm still crossing through,

13:20.508 --> 13:22.642
what happens?
- It'll cut you in half.

13:22.710 --> 13:25.078
I killed a guy
like that once.

13:25.146 --> 13:28.314
Don't worry.
He was a bad guy.

13:28.381 --> 13:31.016
<i>Olivia, thank you.</i>

13:31.084 --> 13:33.919
I owe you one.

13:38.390 --> 13:41.058
Good luck.

13:49.402 --> 13:50.769
You okay?

13:50.837 --> 13:53.372
One piece.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.616
Colonel Broyles,

14:02.683 --> 14:05.018
sensors detecting
a class-three breach.

14:05.085 --> 14:06.953
That's impossible.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.822
We haven't had any degradation
since the universes were linked.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.624
Nonetheless, sir,
redundant systems are confirming

14:12.692 --> 14:14.492
<i>a breach at an opera house</i>
<i>in lower Brooklyn.</i>

14:14.560 --> 14:16.060
Where are Agents
Lee and Dunham?

14:16.128 --> 14:17.562
En route to H.Q.,
ten minutes out.

14:17.630 --> 14:19.764
Notify them of the breach
and redirect them there.

14:19.831 --> 14:21.398
And dispatch
an Amber team to meet them.

14:21.466 --> 14:25.536
This place isn't all that
different from our--

14:27.071 --> 14:28.873
<i>Hey, Scarecrow, come on.</i>

14:28.940 --> 14:32.409
The flying monkeys
are coming.

14:32.477 --> 14:36.079
<i>- Thank you, gentlemen.</i> 
<i>- Bring the body in here.</i>

14:39.584 --> 14:41.986
Sir, may I ask
what's going on?

14:42.053 --> 14:44.322
Nothing to concern
yourself with.

14:44.390 --> 14:45.523
I need you
and your staff

14:45.591 --> 14:48.660
to vacate the lab
until further notice.

14:48.728 --> 14:52.498
Sergeant Kane, please
stand guard at the door.

14:52.566 --> 14:55.100
Make sure no one
disturbs me.

15:35.729 --> 15:37.029
How's it going?

15:37.097 --> 15:38.998
Agent Lee,
good to see you again.

15:39.065 --> 15:41.466
I got a prisoner here I need
to transport to Liberty Island.

15:44.202 --> 15:45.903
I don't have
any transport order.

15:45.971 --> 15:47.271
No, you wouldn't.

15:47.339 --> 15:49.706
Secretary Bishop wants to keep
this one off the books--

15:49.774 --> 15:54.511
<i>keeping it quiet</i>
<i>for security reasons.</i>

15:54.579 --> 15:56.747
You think
I'm making this up?

15:56.814 --> 15:58.382
No.
Not at all, sir.

15:58.449 --> 16:00.150
I can call up the SECDEF's
office to clear it up.

16:00.218 --> 16:02.652
Sure, you speak
to somebody there.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.122
They clear it with someone else,
who clears it up the chain.

16:05.189 --> 16:06.856
That's at least three people
you just included

16:06.924 --> 16:08.491
in a classified
interrogation.

16:08.559 --> 16:10.593
You go right ahead.

16:10.661 --> 16:14.830
It's your ass,
not mine.

16:14.898 --> 16:17.032
I see what you mean.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.233
You know what?

16:18.301 --> 16:21.002
- I'll send for the ferry.
- Good idea.

16:21.069 --> 16:23.971
I just need
your "show me."

16:24.039 --> 16:27.174
Yeah, uh, about that...

16:27.242 --> 16:28.609
I had to jump
into the East River

16:28.677 --> 16:29.710
to catch this scumbag.

16:29.778 --> 16:31.479
Must've lost it
in the drink.

16:31.547 --> 16:35.016
That's fine.
Your handprint will do.

16:46.998 --> 16:51.534
The ferry should be
at the pier shortly.

16:55.940 --> 16:59.342
Agent Lee...

16:59.410 --> 17:01.411
I'll go ahead and report
your "show me" lost.

17:01.478 --> 17:02.945
Thanks.

17:03.013 --> 17:05.414
I'm impressed--

17:05.482 --> 17:07.449
quite a knack
for deception.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.555
<i>Colonel...</i>

17:12.623 --> 17:14.424
We checked our readings again.
They're still negative.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.192
<i>If there was any kind</i>
<i>of degradation here,</i>

17:16.260 --> 17:17.193
<i>it's gone now.</i>

17:17.261 --> 17:18.494
Copy that.

17:18.561 --> 17:20.464
The breach is no longer
registering here either.

17:20.531 --> 17:21.632
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>a false alarm.</i>

17:21.700 --> 17:23.733
Maybe there was a glitch
with the sensors?

17:23.801 --> 17:25.936
<i>Maybe.</i>

17:26.005 --> 17:27.739
<i>Recall your team</i>
<i>and report back to H.Q.</i>

17:29.275 --> 17:31.709
Dreaming of a life
in the theater?

17:31.776 --> 17:33.844
You know, that body
at the bus terminal--

17:33.912 --> 17:35.446
his face
was pretty messed up.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.281
The guy was
pancaked by a bus.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.182
I mean his features.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.084
They didn't add up.
They were all mismatched.

17:41.152 --> 17:43.654
His hair, his eyes--
one blue, one brown.

17:43.721 --> 17:44.821
Okay.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.956
Well, you add that
to the fact

17:47.024 --> 17:48.724
that he ran up
the side of a bus,

17:48.792 --> 17:52.595
then jumped ten yards
and landed on his feet.

17:52.663 --> 17:55.832
I think he might've been
a shapeshifter.

17:55.899 --> 17:57.333
You mean those
human shapeshifters

17:57.401 --> 18:00.403
the other side's accusing us
of sending over.

18:00.471 --> 18:02.071
Okay.

18:02.139 --> 18:05.241
Well, I guess once the D.O.D.
confirms that with the autopsy,

18:05.309 --> 18:07.176
Secretary Bishop
will let us know.

18:07.244 --> 18:08.377
Unless he doesn't.

18:08.445 --> 18:10.113
I mean, their Olivia
said that she believed

18:10.181 --> 18:12.282
he was responsible
for these new shapeshifters.

18:12.349 --> 18:14.250
Since when do you listen
to anything they have to say?

18:14.318 --> 18:15.585
You said yourself
she's a paranoid

18:15.653 --> 18:16.753
who doesn't trust
anyone.

18:16.820 --> 18:19.022
Yeah, that doesn't mean
she's not right.

18:19.090 --> 18:20.290
I mean,
think about it.

18:20.357 --> 18:22.325
What if the Secretary had us
removed from the crime scene

18:22.393 --> 18:24.260
so that he could cover up
his own involvement?

18:24.328 --> 18:27.363
Now who's paranoid?

18:31.735 --> 18:33.936
Okay. Why won't
the car start?

18:37.240 --> 18:38.307
<i>Lost?</i>

18:38.374 --> 18:40.041
I never reported it lost.

18:40.109 --> 18:41.476
They said
the report came

18:41.544 --> 18:45.080
from the D.O.D. checkpoint
at the pier.

18:46.616 --> 18:48.483
Checkpoint Five,
Corporal Wheeler.

18:48.551 --> 18:49.918
Wheeler,
this is Agent Lee.

18:49.986 --> 18:51.820
I understand somebody there
reported my "show me" lost.

18:51.888 --> 18:56.258
Agent Lee?

18:56.326 --> 18:58.260
Once I get in to see Walternate,
you should probably take off,

18:58.328 --> 18:59.761
head back
to the opera house

18:59.829 --> 19:01.930
before they figure out
you're not who you say you are.

19:01.998 --> 19:03.432
You've been there before,
their D.O.D.

19:03.499 --> 19:05.968
It was in your debrief with
Broyles after you showed up.

19:06.035 --> 19:07.569
Yeah, Walternate wanted
to keep me close

19:07.637 --> 19:09.037
when I was working
on the machine.

19:09.105 --> 19:10.639
In his secure room.

19:10.707 --> 19:12.975
You said that's where he kept
his classified files.

19:13.043 --> 19:14.343
If you worked in it,

19:14.411 --> 19:18.580
you must know
how to get into it.

19:18.648 --> 19:20.449
Why are we talking
about this, Lincoln?

19:20.517 --> 19:22.585
Just tell me
where it's located, Peter.

19:22.653 --> 19:25.454
Oh, I don't believe this.

19:25.522 --> 19:26.789
You don't
have to be involved.

19:26.857 --> 19:30.626
Of course they're gonna
think I'm involved!

19:30.694 --> 19:32.127
- You're about to ruin the best chance...
- I didn't come this far...

19:32.195 --> 19:33.262
- to go back empty-handed!
- that I have to get back home!

19:33.329 --> 19:34.830
<i>Don't move!</i>

19:34.898 --> 19:37.332
Put your hands
behind your head!

19:40.503 --> 19:42.004
<i>Just give me a chance</i>
<i>to explain.</i>

19:42.071 --> 19:43.438
Look, I know
how this looks,

19:43.506 --> 19:45.974
<i>but it's</i>
<i>a misunderstanding.</i>

19:46.042 --> 19:48.377
Agent Lee,
I presume.

19:48.444 --> 19:49.611
We can straighten
this out.

19:49.679 --> 19:51.446
I have to talk
to Secretary Bishop.

19:51.514 --> 19:54.983
Who the hell are you?

19:57.553 --> 19:59.687
Yes?

19:59.755 --> 20:01.189
<i>Mr. Secretary,</i>
<i>it's Colonel Broyles.</i>

20:01.256 --> 20:03.825
Sorry to disturb you,
but you need to know

20:03.893 --> 20:06.394
there's been an incursion
from the other universe.

20:06.462 --> 20:08.763
We've apprehended two men
who were on their way to you.

20:08.831 --> 20:12.767
One is their Fringe Division's
Lincoln Lee.

20:12.834 --> 20:15.469
The other man...

20:15.537 --> 20:17.438
He claims to be
Peter Bishop,

20:17.506 --> 20:20.374
<i>your son.</i>

20:20.442 --> 20:21.776
My son?

20:21.843 --> 20:23.911
<i>That's what he said, sir.</i>

20:23.979 --> 20:25.746
<i>We'll attempt to ascertain</i>
<i>his real identity</i>

20:25.814 --> 20:27.882
<i>once we have them</i>
<i>in custody.</i>

20:27.949 --> 20:29.883
<i>Agents Lee and Dunham</i>
<i>are convoying the prisoners</i>

20:29.951 --> 20:33.421
<i>back to Fringe H.Q. now</i>
<i>for questioning.</i>

20:33.488 --> 20:36.124
<i>Do you want me to contact</i>
<i>the other side,</i>

20:36.191 --> 20:39.961
<i>demand an explanation?</i>

20:40.028 --> 20:41.829
No.

20:41.897 --> 20:43.364
Tell them nothing
until you've had

20:43.432 --> 20:47.101
a chance to interrogate
these men.

20:47.169 --> 20:50.438
And keep me informed
with what you learn.

21:03.626 --> 21:05.284
This was Olivia's idea,
wasn't it?

21:05.285 --> 21:06.419
Doesn't matter much now,
does it?

21:06.487 --> 21:08.587
Yeah, it matters to me.

21:08.655 --> 21:10.589
<i>I thought</i>
<i>I could trust you two.</i>

21:10.657 --> 21:12.091
I get it, Peter.

21:12.158 --> 21:14.693
You want to go home
to your people.

21:14.761 --> 21:16.394
Well, we are fighting
for our people.

21:16.462 --> 21:18.897
<i>Whatever these</i>
<i>shapeshifters are up to,</i>

21:18.965 --> 21:21.499
<i>we have to stop them.</i>

21:21.567 --> 21:25.670
<i>Sorry if I thought</i>
<i>you wanted that, too.</i>

21:25.737 --> 21:27.905
It's not my fight.

21:31.643 --> 21:34.678
Agent Murphy.

21:34.746 --> 21:36.180
Affirmative, sir.

21:36.248 --> 21:39.617
<i>As a matter of fact, I have</i>
<i>them in my transport right now.</i>

21:39.684 --> 21:44.255
All right, sir.
I understand.

21:50.128 --> 21:52.462
What just happened?

21:52.530 --> 21:53.463
We lost the transport.

21:57.667 --> 21:59.101
Agent Murphy, Agent Cole,
do you copy?

22:02.539 --> 22:04.510
<i>Agent Murphy,</i>
<i>Agent Cole, respond.</i>

22:04.511 --> 22:07.246
Hey!
Murphy, what's going on?

22:14.151 --> 22:17.921
Transport one, this is Dunham.
Do you copy?

22:17.988 --> 22:20.257
Agent Murphy, come in.

22:20.324 --> 22:21.992
Agent Farnsworth,
where is the locate

22:22.059 --> 22:23.193
<i>on that prisoner transport?</i>

22:23.261 --> 22:24.995
Still looking.
Stand by.

22:33.504 --> 22:34.637
<i>Get out.</i>

22:45.247 --> 22:48.416
Your cuffs--
take 'em off.

22:48.483 --> 22:50.918
You trying to make this
look like an escape attempt,

22:50.986 --> 22:52.454
like we're the ones
that killed your partner?

22:52.521 --> 22:55.691
<i>Your turn.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

22:55.759 --> 22:57.493
That call you got--
was that from Secretary Bishop?

22:57.561 --> 22:59.495
Did he tell you
to do this?

22:59.563 --> 23:01.464
He's making a mistake.

23:01.532 --> 23:03.133
I just came here
to talk to him.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.935
He doesn't understand
why I'm here.

23:05.002 --> 23:07.671
It doesn't matter
why you're here.

23:07.739 --> 23:10.174
I have my orders.

23:21.720 --> 23:25.123
We got to get
out of here, now.

23:25.191 --> 23:27.858
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!

23:27.926 --> 23:32.463
We're doing this
my way now.

23:34.299 --> 23:38.268
You're 100 meters
from the transport.

23:38.336 --> 23:40.370
- <i>Wait. They're on the move again.</i>
- What?

23:40.438 --> 23:41.738
<i>Take the next alley.</i>

23:41.806 --> 23:43.406
<i>There are two transponders</i>
<i>still in the alley.</i>

23:43.474 --> 23:44.407
Okay, you let me out.

23:44.474 --> 23:46.375
You stay
with the transport.

23:53.550 --> 23:56.184
We got two agents down.

23:56.252 --> 23:58.019
<i>All units, the suspects</i>
<i>are headed north</i>

23:58.087 --> 24:01.722
<i>down the alley</i>
<i>by Franklin and Broadway.</i>

24:12.100 --> 24:13.668
Out of the vehicle, now!

24:19.075 --> 24:21.577
On the ground.

24:28.585 --> 24:31.254
<i>So where is he?</i>

24:31.322 --> 24:32.589
I have no idea.

24:32.656 --> 24:33.589
I told you, he ran.

24:33.657 --> 24:35.124
Agent Murphy's
"show me" was used

24:35.192 --> 24:38.961
at the Canal Street subway
turnstile 20 minutes ago.

24:39.028 --> 24:40.562
So you led us
on that little diversion

24:40.630 --> 24:41.863
so your friend
could get away.

24:41.931 --> 24:43.731
<i>Broyles put</i>
<i>his description out</i>

24:43.799 --> 24:45.332
to transit
and Metro P.D.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.834
He won't get far.

24:47.902 --> 24:50.604
You and your pal murdered
two Fringe agents.

24:50.672 --> 24:53.140
Every cop in the city
is gonna be looking for him.

24:53.208 --> 24:55.910
Right.
That's what happened.

24:55.977 --> 24:58.279
We came all this way
to kill two Fringe agents.

24:58.346 --> 24:59.647
That's brilliant.

24:59.714 --> 25:01.549
No wonder
you're a detective.

25:01.617 --> 25:04.052
Makes a hell
of a lot more sense

25:04.119 --> 25:06.087
than Agent Murphy
shooting his own partner,

25:06.155 --> 25:07.688
then trying
to kill you two

25:07.756 --> 25:11.992
because somebody called him up
and ordered him to do it.

25:12.060 --> 25:14.061
So who on our side
would want you dead?

25:14.129 --> 25:16.563
Your boss...

25:18.166 --> 25:20.800
the Secretary of Defense.

25:20.868 --> 25:23.470
So, clearly, in the other
universe, I'm a nut job.

25:23.537 --> 25:25.071
What makes you so sure

25:25.139 --> 25:27.340
that it was the Secretary
on the other end of that call?

25:27.407 --> 25:29.242
Our universe
has been infiltrated

25:29.309 --> 25:31.644
by shapeshifters
from your side.

25:31.712 --> 25:35.381
They've killed a lot of people,
including a friend of mine for--

25:35.448 --> 25:37.249
for reasons I still
don't understand.

25:37.317 --> 25:40.752
And your Defense Secretary's
behind them.

25:40.820 --> 25:44.255
He's obviously got people inside
your division working for him.

25:44.323 --> 25:46.457
You take me in, he's gonna
see to it I disappear.

25:46.525 --> 25:48.826
Trace the call.

25:48.894 --> 25:50.929
Trace the call
that was made to Agent Murphy.

25:50.997 --> 25:52.331
If it leads back
to Secretary Bishop,

25:52.398 --> 25:53.465
you know I'm right.

25:53.533 --> 25:58.371
If our division's compromised,
why trust us?

25:58.439 --> 25:59.373
Because of her.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.909
Peter said
I could trust you.

26:01.976 --> 26:03.777
He doesn't even know me.

26:03.845 --> 26:07.214
Peter said at the end of
the day, you're a good person.

26:07.282 --> 26:10.918
You'd do the right thing.

26:13.455 --> 26:15.156
Liv?

26:15.224 --> 26:18.626
We'll sort it out
at headquarters.

27:04.440 --> 27:05.407
- Oh, God!
- I'm sorry.

27:05.475 --> 27:07.242
I'm not here
to hurt you, I--

27:07.310 --> 27:09.377
- I have money. Just take--
- Oh, no, you don't understand.

27:09.445 --> 27:11.313
I just need to speak
with your husband.

27:11.381 --> 27:14.549
It's very important.

27:19.188 --> 27:21.856
Peter.

27:30.974 --> 27:33.341
Over the years, my husband
has opened my mind

27:33.409 --> 27:38.246
to things that I never
thought possible.

27:38.314 --> 27:42.883
And still,
I never thought that...

27:44.986 --> 27:47.921
But as soon as I looked
into your eyes, I knew.

27:54.894 --> 27:56.929
They, um...

27:56.997 --> 27:59.665
They told me
that you died...

27:59.733 --> 28:03.268
The night that you
were taken from me.

28:03.336 --> 28:05.637
And they told you
the truth.

28:05.704 --> 28:07.872
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

28:07.940 --> 28:10.709
I'm not the Peter
that you think I am.

28:10.776 --> 28:15.281
I'm from
another place.

28:15.348 --> 28:19.185
It's all
very complicated.

28:20.922 --> 28:24.358
But I have people there that
I care about very, very deeply,

28:24.425 --> 28:28.195
and I have to get
back to them.

28:31.966 --> 28:35.568
That's what got me
through it, you know?

28:35.636 --> 28:39.906
I told myself that
if another universe exists--

28:39.973 --> 28:42.274
and there's
got to be more--

28:42.342 --> 28:45.677
then somewhere...

28:45.745 --> 28:49.347
You would grow up
and be happy and...

28:49.415 --> 28:52.184
and fall in love.

28:52.251 --> 28:55.020
Somewhere
you would have a life...

28:55.088 --> 28:58.123
Just--just not here.

28:59.993 --> 29:01.861
That's why I came here.

29:01.929 --> 29:03.329
It's why I need
to speak to Walter.

29:03.397 --> 29:04.931
He's the only person
who can help me.

29:04.999 --> 29:06.866
Yeah, of course.

29:06.934 --> 29:09.169
If--if your father--

29:09.236 --> 29:11.738
if Walter knew
that you were here,

29:11.806 --> 29:13.306
he would do everything
he could to help you.

29:13.374 --> 29:15.275
He's, um...

29:15.342 --> 29:17.276
He's at work.
I'll call the office.

29:17.344 --> 29:18.444
Oh, no. No.

29:18.511 --> 29:20.179
No, I-I'm sorry.
You can't do that.

29:20.246 --> 29:22.981
You can't let anybody else
know that I'm here.

29:23.049 --> 29:24.882
When I first
crossed over,

29:24.950 --> 29:26.784
people who worked for your
husband tried to kill me.

29:26.852 --> 29:28.986
What?

29:29.054 --> 29:30.955
- Why would anyone try to--
- I don't know.

29:31.023 --> 29:33.258
But clearly someone thinks
that my being here is a threat.

29:33.325 --> 29:35.594
Then, Peter...

29:35.661 --> 29:37.629
We need to protect you.

29:37.697 --> 29:41.466
Walter has to know
about this.

29:41.534 --> 29:43.402
I think that
he already does.

29:47.074 --> 29:48.408
<i>The alarm.</i>

29:48.476 --> 29:49.977
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Before I knew it was you,

29:50.044 --> 29:52.579
I-I hit the alarm.

29:52.647 --> 29:54.147
Peter, why have you
got a gun?

29:54.215 --> 29:56.683
<i>Mrs. Bishop.</i>

29:56.751 --> 29:57.918
Give me the gun.

29:57.986 --> 29:59.519
<i>Mrs. Bishop.</i>

29:59.587 --> 30:01.354
Peter, if you don't give me
the gun, they will shoot you.

30:05.593 --> 30:07.660
<i>Mrs. Bishop,</i>
<i>are you all right?</i>

30:07.728 --> 30:10.530
I won't let anything
happen to you...

30:10.598 --> 30:12.899
Not this time.

30:17.205 --> 30:18.305
Okay, don't shoot.

30:18.372 --> 30:19.606
<i>That's him.</i>
<i>Hands in the air!</i>

30:19.674 --> 30:21.307
Okay, don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

30:21.375 --> 30:23.109
Mrs. Bishop, step away.
This man is dangerous.

30:23.177 --> 30:24.477
<i>He's killed</i>
<i>two Fringe agents.</i>

30:24.545 --> 30:26.480
No, anyone who fires
on this man

30:26.547 --> 30:28.115
will have my husband
to answer to.

30:28.182 --> 30:30.484
<i>A mistake</i>
<i>has been made.</i>

30:30.551 --> 30:34.954
I need your men to transport us
to the Department of Defense.

30:39.626 --> 30:41.526
You heard me.

30:41.594 --> 30:43.728
We are going
to see my husband.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.233
<i>He'll have to be</i>
<i>restrained.</i>

30:49.301 --> 30:50.301
That's fine.

30:53.572 --> 30:55.473
Walter will straighten
all this out.

30:55.541 --> 30:58.943
You'll see.

31:04.016 --> 31:05.450
What the hell is this?

31:05.518 --> 31:07.986
This is where
we're holding you.

31:08.054 --> 31:09.655
It's a maintenance closet.

31:09.723 --> 31:14.025
That's very astute.
No wonder you're a detective.

31:14.093 --> 31:16.194
We looked into
Agent Murphy's phone logs,

31:16.262 --> 31:17.528
and he did
receive a call

31:17.596 --> 31:19.764
just before the vehicle
disappeared from the convoy.

31:19.832 --> 31:21.332
Like I said.

31:21.400 --> 31:22.833
We're gonna trace
the call,

31:22.901 --> 31:25.168
and if it leads back
to the Secretary of Defense,

31:25.236 --> 31:26.436
then we can talk.

31:26.504 --> 31:29.372
If not, this isn't
the last windowless room

31:29.440 --> 31:31.407
you're gonna find
yourself in.

31:31.475 --> 31:33.443
Make yourself
comfortable.

31:33.510 --> 31:36.012
Nobody knows
you're here but us.

31:39.284 --> 31:41.285
We're breaking
about five different

31:41.353 --> 31:42.920
general orders
right now.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.360
I hope you know
what you're doing.

31:44.385 --> 31:45.585
Me too.

31:56.702 --> 31:57.735
Walter.

32:03.209 --> 32:04.209
It's Peter.

32:04.277 --> 32:06.979
<i>It's a miracle.</i>

32:11.751 --> 32:14.386
Of course it is.

32:24.396 --> 32:27.965
I've dreamt about this moment
for so many years.

32:28.033 --> 32:31.970
And now you're
actually here...

32:32.037 --> 32:34.139
<i>Standing</i>
<i>in front of me.</i>

32:36.509 --> 32:37.709
Take these
restraints off him.

32:37.777 --> 32:38.944
- <i>Sir--</i>
- Take them off.

32:39.012 --> 32:41.747
And then leave us.

32:46.853 --> 32:49.121
I know...

32:49.188 --> 32:51.289
I know that you don't want
to hear this right now,

32:51.357 --> 32:55.026
Secretary Bishop, but...

32:55.094 --> 32:57.596
I'm not your son.

32:59.867 --> 33:02.134
I know that.

33:02.202 --> 33:04.170
How could you be?

33:04.238 --> 33:06.873
He came to ask
for your help.

33:06.940 --> 33:08.908
I promised him you would.

33:14.047 --> 33:16.182
Would you leave us
for a moment, Elizabeth?

33:16.250 --> 33:17.283
I--
I'd--

33:17.351 --> 33:19.552
I'd like to speak
to Peter alone.

33:19.620 --> 33:21.921
Just a few moments,
please, dear.

33:26.159 --> 33:29.629
All right...

33:29.696 --> 33:30.696
All right.

33:35.335 --> 33:36.702
Thank you.

33:51.451 --> 33:54.753
I must say, that was
a brilliant performance.

33:54.821 --> 33:57.722
You almost looked
genuinely surprised to see me,

33:57.790 --> 34:02.126
which we both know
is not the case.

34:02.194 --> 34:06.696
I've known about you
for some time.

34:12.703 --> 34:15.004
I've been monitoring
the intelligence feeds

34:15.072 --> 34:16.237
from the other universe.

34:16.306 --> 34:22.110
Yeah, if by "monitoring"
you mean spying.

34:22.178 --> 34:25.045
You have a very ill
opinion of me.

34:25.114 --> 34:27.614
Where I'm from,
I know you all too well.

34:27.683 --> 34:29.951
Really?

34:30.018 --> 34:31.119
What do you know?

34:31.186 --> 34:33.255
For starters,
I know you've already tried

34:33.322 --> 34:35.090
to have me
killed once today.

34:39.362 --> 34:40.429
And why would
I do that?

34:40.496 --> 34:42.165
I don't know, Walter.

34:42.233 --> 34:43.667
Maybe you see me
as a threat.

34:43.734 --> 34:46.904
They know that you created
the human shapeshifters.

34:46.971 --> 34:48.339
And they know
that you're responsible

34:48.407 --> 34:49.907
for sending them
into the alternate universe,

34:49.975 --> 34:51.976
in violation
of your accord with them.

34:52.043 --> 34:56.179
So you have come all this way
to bring me to justice.

34:56.246 --> 34:57.815
No.

34:59.551 --> 35:02.252
Whatever disagreements there are
between this universe and theirs

35:02.320 --> 35:04.621
are none of my business.

35:04.688 --> 35:06.956
I'll tell you exactly
what I told them.

35:07.024 --> 35:09.391
It is not my fight.

35:09.459 --> 35:12.094
All I want is your help
to get me back where I belong...

35:12.162 --> 35:14.697
To get me home.

35:16.167 --> 35:20.871
If you want to get rid of me,
just help me.

35:23.241 --> 35:25.476
If you believe
that I am to blame

35:25.544 --> 35:29.113
for all those
terrible things,

35:29.181 --> 35:31.916
your decision to come here
must've been difficult.

35:38.823 --> 35:41.558
I didn't really have
any other choice.

35:41.626 --> 35:44.928
I see.

35:44.996 --> 35:46.830
Well, no one knows more

35:46.898 --> 35:51.300
about the burden
of difficult decisions than I.

35:53.236 --> 35:56.405
Sir, Sergeant Kane
said you wanted to see me.

35:56.473 --> 36:00.543
Doctor. Come in.

36:00.610 --> 36:02.712
Dr. Fayette, this man
is from the other side.

36:02.779 --> 36:06.182
He is making serious
accusations against me.

36:06.250 --> 36:07.650
He believes,
among other things,

36:07.718 --> 36:10.085
that I am responsible
for the shapeshifters

36:10.153 --> 36:12.755
that are plaguing
the other universe.

36:12.822 --> 36:15.023
Now, you are
my chief scientist.

36:15.091 --> 36:19.461
You know me and my operation
better than anyone.

36:19.529 --> 36:21.063
Is it possible?

36:21.131 --> 36:24.566
Is there any way that what
he is saying could be true?

36:28.471 --> 36:29.904
I don't see how, sir.

36:29.972 --> 36:32.607
<i>I examined the shapeshifter</i>
<i>tech in detail.</i>

36:32.674 --> 36:36.878
I saw nothing to indicate you
had anything to do with it, sir.

36:36.946 --> 36:39.714
There. You see?

36:39.782 --> 36:42.284
If I may ask...

36:53.831 --> 36:56.666
Not everything
is as it seems.

37:00.585 --> 37:02.086
I've suspected
for some time

37:02.154 --> 37:04.088
that Dr. Fayette had been
replaced by a shapeshifter.

37:04.591 --> 37:06.492
My men have been following
him for some weeks,

37:06.560 --> 37:08.794
monitoring all
of his communications.

37:08.862 --> 37:10.462
So what are you gonna
do with him?

37:10.530 --> 37:12.264
Interrogate him,

37:12.332 --> 37:15.534
get what information I can
to find out who's behind this.

37:15.602 --> 37:20.072
Earlier today,
a state department employee

37:20.140 --> 37:22.342
was the victim
of another shapeshifter...

37:22.409 --> 37:24.477
Trying to acquire
his identity.

37:24.545 --> 37:26.713
It's become all too clear

37:26.780 --> 37:29.815
that elements of our government
are being infiltrated.

37:29.883 --> 37:31.450
If you've known
about this for so long,

37:31.518 --> 37:33.018
why haven't you
done anything?

37:33.086 --> 37:34.152
Done what exactly?

37:34.220 --> 37:37.222
If word got out
that elected officials

37:37.290 --> 37:41.126
and other authorities were not
who they claimed to be,

37:41.194 --> 37:42.995
it would cause
widespread panic,

37:43.062 --> 37:44.229
and society
would collapse.

37:44.297 --> 37:45.864
No, trust me on this.

37:45.932 --> 37:47.699
You have to find
the shapeshifters,

37:47.767 --> 37:49.200
expose them
for what they are.

37:49.268 --> 37:50.535
And how would you
propose I do that?

37:50.603 --> 37:53.004
Well, that device you used
seemed to do the trick.

37:53.072 --> 37:54.372
Yes.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.842
And I spent weeks
convincing myself

37:56.909 --> 38:00.945
that Dr. Fayette
had been replaced.

38:01.013 --> 38:03.748
If I had been wrong,

38:03.816 --> 38:06.384
this tech would've killed
a human being.

38:09.221 --> 38:11.889
Why are you telling me
all of this?

38:15.927 --> 38:18.429
Because you are
the only person I can trust.

38:18.496 --> 38:21.665
You have no alliances...

38:21.733 --> 38:25.602
to our side or theirs.

38:25.670 --> 38:28.706
I'm telling you this because
I need you to deliver a message.

38:28.774 --> 38:32.244
I appreciate what you're
up against here, but--

38:32.312 --> 38:33.745
- It's not your fight?
- Exactly.

38:33.813 --> 38:35.047
It's not my fight.

38:35.115 --> 38:37.517
I came here because I needed
your help to get home.

38:37.584 --> 38:40.753
The Walter on the other side
refuses to help me,

38:40.821 --> 38:42.288
but you understand
that machine.

38:42.356 --> 38:43.956
You share his mind.

38:44.024 --> 38:45.791
You're the only person
who can help me get back

38:45.859 --> 38:46.859
to where I belong.

38:46.926 --> 38:51.229
And I will do
everything in my power

38:51.297 --> 38:54.132
to help you get home.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.967
But you must go back
to the other side

38:56.035 --> 39:00.138
and tell them
that I am not their enemy.

39:00.205 --> 39:03.308
Whoever is behind this
is a threat to us all.

39:14.854 --> 39:17.222
I was wrong about you.

39:19.226 --> 39:22.395
You're not the man
I thought you were.

39:24.098 --> 39:27.166
You are exactly the man
I thought you would be.

39:33.507 --> 39:36.142
Please do this
for me, Peter.

39:36.210 --> 39:37.743
Help us.

39:42.715 --> 39:46.051
Agent Farnsworth traced
the call to Murphy's cuff

39:46.118 --> 39:48.754
back to an industrial park
in the Flatiron district.

39:48.821 --> 39:52.024
The area's been abandoned
since the Amber riots of '06.

39:52.091 --> 39:54.693
The flatiron district...

39:54.761 --> 39:56.562
That doesn't sound
like it's connected

39:56.630 --> 39:58.130
to the D.O.D.
or Secretary Bishop.

39:58.198 --> 40:00.132
Maybe it isn't, but we should
still check it out.

40:00.200 --> 40:03.336
Liv, how much longer are we
gonna keep Broyles in the dark?

40:03.404 --> 40:05.672
- We're just following up on a lead.
- No.

40:05.739 --> 40:06.973
We're chasing the story
of a suspect

40:07.040 --> 40:09.408
who may have murdered
two of our own agents...

40:09.476 --> 40:11.210
And who, by the way,
we locked in a broom closet

40:11.278 --> 40:14.380
instead of holding,
where he belongs.

40:14.447 --> 40:15.814
What if he's right?

40:15.882 --> 40:19.251
What if he's not?

40:19.319 --> 40:23.055
We have to tell
Broyles something.

40:26.193 --> 40:28.428
Did you process
the prisoner into holding?

40:28.495 --> 40:31.164
He's been secured, sir.

40:31.232 --> 40:33.232
But that's not
why we're here.

40:36.236 --> 40:37.803
I take it this is
about the trace

40:37.871 --> 40:39.372
you ran on Agent Murphy's
ear cuff.

40:39.440 --> 40:41.775
<i>Agent Farnsworth</i>
<i>told me.</i>

40:41.842 --> 40:45.779
You want to tell me what it is
you're looking for?

40:45.847 --> 40:48.982
Uh, well, it may be nothing,
but until we know more...

40:49.050 --> 40:51.384
We would like
some leeway on this.

40:56.557 --> 40:58.792
Okay.
Keep me posted.

40:58.860 --> 41:01.094
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

41:15.508 --> 41:17.142
<i>Colonel Broyles.</i>

41:17.210 --> 41:18.877
They're on their way
to you now.

41:18.945 --> 41:21.879
Excellent.

41:24.183 --> 41:27.586
We'll be waiting
for them.

41:49.078 --> 41:52.748
Who are you?
Who are you?

41:52.816 --> 41:55.250
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands.

41:55.318 --> 41:56.818
How did you--
<i>how did you--</i>

41:56.886 --> 42:00.722
stop doing that.
Stop doing that.

42:00.790 --> 42:03.625
Who the hell are you?
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

42:06.997 --> 42:10.033
I have come
to tell you something...

42:10.101 --> 42:12.369
Olivia.

42:12.436 --> 42:14.271
How did you
know my name?

42:18.510 --> 42:20.111
How do you know my--

42:26.786 --> 42:30.187
You've been shot.

42:30.255 --> 42:33.123
I came to tell you...

42:33.191 --> 42:36.226
I have looked
at all possible futures...

42:36.294 --> 42:39.763
And in every one,

42:39.830 --> 42:42.699
the result is the same.

42:44.735 --> 42:46.637
You have to die.

42:53.645 --> 42:56.647
I'm gonna get you
to a hospital.
