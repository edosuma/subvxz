BUT WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO FIND
A STUNTMAN THIS LATE IN THE

01:46.360 --> 01:48.680

Muscle Man: WELL, I MIGHT

01:47.760 --> 01:49.100
KNOW A GUY WHO...

01:49.200 --> 01:50.220
ACTUALLY, NO.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.500
I DON'T KNOW ANY STUNTMEN.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.100
UGH! YOU'RE LOSIN' IT, MITCH!

01:53.200 --> 01:54.260
Benson: THAT'S IT!

01:54.360 --> 01:55.980
WE HAVE TO CANCEL TIMMY'S PARTY.

01:56.080 --> 01:56.820
Rigby: NO, WAIT!

01:56.920 --> 02:00.000
Mordecai: YEAH. MAYBE ONE OF
US CAN DO THE STUNT.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.880
Benson: NO, IT HAS TO BE A
LICENSED STUNTMAN.

02:00.840 --> 02:04.120
OUR INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER
AMATEURS.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.260

02:04.360 --> 02:05.180
TO GET A LICENSE?

02:05.280 --> 02:05.900
Benson: HARD.

02:06.000 --> 02:06.900
THE SUCCESS RATE AT

02:07.000 --> 02:08.500
STUNTMAN COLLEGE IS ONLY 25%,

02:08.600 --> 02:09.980
AND YOU GUYS AREN'T EXACTLY

02:10.080 --> 02:11.020

Mordecai: BUT IF IT'S 25%,

02:12.520 --> 02:14.100
THEN AT LEAST ONE OF US SHOULD

02:14.200 --> 02:17.160
BE ABLE TO DO IT, RIGHT?
Benson: YOU THINK <i>YOU'RE</i>

02:16.200 --> 02:19.400
GONNA BEAT THE ODDS LIKE THAT IN
ONE DAY?

02:17.920 --> 02:21.080
Muscle Man: IF THAT'S WHAT
IT'LL TAKE TO MAKE TIMMY HAPPY,

02:20.240 --> 02:20.940
THEN WE'LL DO IT.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.160

CHANCE WE HAVE.

Mordecai: WE'RE DONE WITH ALL
THE PARTY PREP.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.560
I'LL ENROLL US RIGHT NOW.
Benson: OKAY.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.800
BUT ONE OF YOU BETTER COME BACK
WITH A STUNTMAN LICENSE OR ELSE

02:29.320 --> 02:32.720
TIMMY'S BIRTHDAY ââ AND PROBABLY
HIS LIFE ââ ARE GONNA BE RUINED.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.020
Mordecai: ARE YOU SURE THIS

02:34.120 --> 02:36.800
IS THE RIGHT PLACE?
Muscle Man: IT'S THE ADDRESS

02:36.160 --> 02:39.320
THAT WAS ON THE BROCHURE.
Rigby: THIS IS DEFINITELY THE

02:38.880 --> 02:41.440
RIGHT PLACE.
JOHNNY CRASHER IS A LIVING

03:11.080 --> 03:11.900
TO BE PRETTY?

THEY CONTAIN EVERYTHING YOU NEED
TO KNOW TO COMPLETE THIS COURSE.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.900
YOU SHOULD READ THESE IN CASE I

03:29.000 --> 03:32.400
FORGET TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING
IMPORTANT, WHICH IS VERY LIKELY,

03:32.120 --> 03:33.820

TAKES TO BE A STUNTMAN, BUT I'M

03:37.640 --> 03:39.500
HERE TO TELL YOU ââ NONE OF THAT

03:39.600 --> 03:41.260
MATTERS IF YOU CAN'T DO ONE

03:41.360 --> 03:41.740

03:41.840 --> 03:43.660
A STUNTMAN'S GOT TO HIT HIS

03:44.480 --> 03:46.380
IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT, YOU ARE

03:46.480 --> 03:47.140

03:47.240 --> 03:48.940
