00:24.424 --> 00:27.127
<i>Civilization wouldn't
end with nuclear fire.</i>

00:28.095 --> 00:31.164
<i>It'd be tattered and torn
by the likes of disease.</i>

00:31.398 --> 00:33.400
<i>One that could mutate rapidly.</i>

00:34.936 --> 00:36.804
<i>The greatest minds in the
world couldn't understand it.</i>

00:36.838 --> 00:38.706
<i>And therefore, it took over.</i>

00:39.707 --> 00:40.742
<i>Chaos followed.</i>

00:42.342 --> 00:45.045
<i>But the disease
just didn't stop at death, no.</i>

00:46.179 --> 00:49.517
<i>Those who survived it became
something entirely different.</i>

00:50.450 --> 00:53.320
<i>Aggressive,
almost indestructible.</i>

00:54.454 --> 00:57.057
<i>Cannibalistic. Mutants.</i>

00:58.125 --> 01:00.795
<i>We began to call them hunters.</i>

01:35.462 --> 01:38.465
<i>Every once in a while,
I find something out in the wild.</i>

01:39.601 --> 01:44.606
<i>Something unexpected, useful.</i>

01:45.940 --> 01:49.409
<i>Sometimes I even find things
that remind me of a time</i>

01:49.443 --> 01:51.713
<i>that was a hell of a lot
better than right now.</i>

02:00.922 --> 02:02.356
<i>Sometimes I wonder,</i>

02:04.257 --> 02:06.493
<i>you know, bringing something
back to the camp</i>

02:07.494 --> 02:08.895
<i>is better than nothing, right?</i>

02:11.933 --> 02:14.636
<i>It's definitely better than
not returning at all.</i>

03:09.991 --> 03:11.926
<i>Days are long
and the terrain is tough,</i>

03:11.959 --> 03:15.730
<i>but it keeps the monsters
at bay for now.</i>

03:58.639 --> 04:00.373
<i>This is John Wrecker,</i>

04:00.842 --> 04:03.978
<i>Trace Operative, Station 222.</i>

04:05.913 --> 04:07.749
<i>The world we knew is gone.</i>

04:09.483 --> 04:13.487
<i>Pacifica has become a land
of death and despair.</i>

04:23.030 --> 04:27.400
<i>Every day, we fight to
survive this new nightmare,</i>

04:27.434 --> 04:28.903
<i>to survive each other.</i>

04:33.473 --> 04:36.043
<i>Dangerous creatures
now roam the island,</i>

04:37.779 --> 04:39.680
<i>born out of the apocalypse.</i>

04:44.552 --> 04:47.688
<i>They hunt us
from station to station.</i>

04:51.692 --> 04:53.661
<i>And I do the same to them.</i>

05:08.142 --> 05:12.046
<i>They're evolving,
becoming more dangerous.</i>

05:14.816 --> 05:18.853
<i>And therefore, so must I.</i>

05:52.887 --> 05:54.622
<i>When I'm out here by myself,</i>

05:58.425 --> 06:01.095
<i>I start understanding
these creatures more and more.</i>

06:01.128 --> 06:05.633
<i>I start noticing patterns.</i>

06:13.174 --> 06:16.544
<i>I start realizing
their tendencies.</i>

06:17.712 --> 06:19.847
<i>They're starting to become
more predictable.</i>

06:30.224 --> 06:32.526
<i>My biggest fear, though,
is that I am too.</i>

07:46.600 --> 07:47.868
<i>Sleep is a luxury.</i>

07:50.571 --> 07:52.472
<i>But I know
I'm gonna grind it out.</i>

07:52.873 --> 07:54.108
<i>I think of my father</i>

07:54.141 --> 07:56.110
<i>and my father always wanted me
in those corners,</i>

07:56.143 --> 07:57.477
<i>grinding it out.</i>

07:58.713 --> 07:59.880
<i>I'm just praying to
whatever gods are up there</i>

07:59.914 --> 08:04.218
<i>that maybe let the hope
shine in a bit first.</i>

17:52.740 --> 17:55.275
Hey, John.
Didn't see you come in.

17:56.744 --> 17:59.413
No, I don't suppose
you did there, Lewis, did ya?

18:01.849 --> 18:02.850
You get one?

18:04.819 --> 18:06.621
Yes, sir.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.256
I found
their little feeding area,

18:09.891 --> 18:12.092
just outside of
that point right there.

18:15.730 --> 18:16.831
What'd it take
to bring her down?

18:17.565 --> 18:18.866
A little too much C-4.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.337
Anything left of 'em?

18:31.546 --> 18:32.880
Got the usual bits and pieces.

18:32.914 --> 18:34.381
Copy that.

18:37.919 --> 18:39.787
Did you hear any chatter
on the wire lately?

18:41.488 --> 18:43.457
Yeah, 221.

18:45.526 --> 18:47.762
They had a couple of refugees
come down with a fever.

18:48.529 --> 18:49.797
A lot of them didn't make it.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.200
Shame.

18:58.740 --> 19:00.908
John, that looks pretty rough.

19:02.810 --> 19:04.779
Go get changed. Go see Grace.

19:04.812 --> 19:05.913
She'll bandage you up.

19:07.515 --> 19:08.516
Yeah.

19:10.952 --> 19:12.285
Going out again soon?

19:14.956 --> 19:16.289
Yeah, in the morning.

19:17.692 --> 19:19.292
Anything I can get for you?

19:19.961 --> 19:21.428
Besides a bit of shuteye?

19:30.905 --> 19:32.172
I need more grenades.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.375
Copy that.
We're running pretty low.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.345
Well then I guess I'll have to
use them sparingly.

19:41.683 --> 19:43.818
And some more C-4, please.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.420
Oh, John, John, hang on.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.454
I almost forgot.

19:53.027 --> 19:54.394
Got you all fixed up.

19:55.863 --> 19:57.464
Replaced the Lithium reactor,

19:57.865 --> 19:59.867
managed to weld some of
the plates back together,

20:00.400 --> 20:02.202
and we fixed the comm unit.

20:02.937 --> 20:04.404
Should be pretty good to go now.

20:17.585 --> 20:18.385
No worries.

20:19.587 --> 20:21.488
Should give you
a tactical advantage.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.627
Let's hope so.

20:29.764 --> 20:31.966
<i>All these people, my people.</i>

20:33.333 --> 20:35.670
<i>I walk by,
they're huddled in the camp.</i>

20:36.037 --> 20:37.337
<i>They're looking for warmth.</i>

20:37.370 --> 20:38.740
<i>They're looking for food.</i>

20:38.973 --> 20:40.641
<i>They're looking for supplies.</i>

20:41.642 --> 20:45.880
<i>Anything that can help them
get by each day,</i>

20:46.379 --> 20:48.248
<i>each hour, each minute.</i>

21:11.105 --> 21:12.339
John.

21:13.674 --> 21:14.675
Sergeant Wrecker.

21:16.077 --> 21:19.781
Ah, the war,
it's been over for years.

21:21.783 --> 21:23.785
I'm pretty sure
we could lose the formalities.

21:28.523 --> 21:29.824
If you say so.

21:30.558 --> 21:31.559
What can I do for you?

21:33.995 --> 21:37.932
Lewis thought that I might need
a bit of a seeing to on...

21:41.502 --> 21:42.670
Take a seat in my chair.

21:42.703 --> 21:43.738
Thank you.

21:48.576 --> 21:50.812
Not too deep.
Let me grab some gauze.

21:51.546 --> 21:52.680
Was it a scab?

21:52.713 --> 21:53.748
No.

21:54.982 --> 21:55.983
Was it close?

21:58.619 --> 21:59.620
Close enough.

22:01.956 --> 22:05.458
You know, John,
their cells aren't like ours.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.463
What?

22:12.600 --> 22:15.002
The scabs, their cells,

22:16.137 --> 22:17.939
after the infection takes over,

22:17.972 --> 22:19.472
it mutates the cells.

22:22.743 --> 22:25.880
You're telling me these
creatures don't feel any pain?

22:26.446 --> 22:27.447
That's correct.

22:28.883 --> 22:30.551
It starts on the frontal lobe
of the brain.

22:30.885 --> 22:32.053
- What do you mean?
- The brain starts

22:32.419 --> 22:33.420
to disintegrate.

22:34.454 --> 22:35.890
I've done a lot of research,
uh, motor skills,

22:35.923 --> 22:37.692
judgment, social skills,

22:37.725 --> 22:38.726
they're all shot.

22:39.126 --> 22:40.595
Yeah, but these things they...

22:40.628 --> 22:42.362
they communicate
with each other.

22:42.997 --> 22:44.131
Yes, they do.

22:44.165 --> 22:45.733
- And?
- The cells mutate.

22:46.100 --> 22:48.368
Bone density, it grows slightly.

22:49.604 --> 22:50.605
Then the heart,

22:51.906 --> 22:53.040
it goes to a crawl.

22:55.910 --> 22:59.146
After several days
of rapid mutation,

22:59.180 --> 23:00.781
that's when the lights go on.

23:01.515 --> 23:03.150
Rapid movement agitates them.

23:03.918 --> 23:06.921
Motor function
now increases dramatically.

23:07.622 --> 23:08.623
As does hunger.

23:09.991 --> 23:11.759
Yeah. Um...

23:13.928 --> 23:15.863
What am I telling you
all this for?

23:16.797 --> 23:18.065
You already know it already.

23:20.001 --> 23:21.535
I guess it's just a lot...

23:23.037 --> 23:26.674
it's a lot better hearing it
from somebody like you.

23:30.177 --> 23:32.513
I do imagine a lot, by the way.

23:34.215 --> 23:35.516
What do you imagine?

23:38.753 --> 23:40.621
Oh.

23:43.024 --> 23:45.693
Uh, I... I know you're going
back out on patrol again soon.

23:45.726 --> 23:48.696
So get some rest.

23:48.963 --> 23:49.964
Get some food in ya.

23:52.700 --> 23:53.701
And be safe.

23:55.202 --> 23:59.807
I just found this incredible,
uh, reading material

23:59.840 --> 24:00.841
when I was...

24:03.277 --> 24:09.717
and, uh... it's new words. Uh...

24:12.853 --> 24:15.523
It is a base... it's baseball.

24:15.556 --> 24:17.091
- Baseball?
- Mm-hmm.

24:17.124 --> 24:18.125
I love baseball.

24:19.126 --> 24:20.628
I remember baseball.

24:28.636 --> 24:29.704
I'm gonna, ah...

24:31.739 --> 24:32.740
Oh, I...

24:39.180 --> 24:40.781
Okay.

24:40.815 --> 24:41.983
I got some tests to do.

24:42.016 --> 24:44.151
Right. I'll...

24:46.887 --> 24:47.888
Okay.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.769
I'm not looking
to mess up anybody's day.

28:24.438 --> 28:25.439
All right?

28:29.343 --> 28:30.945
Hey, guys.

28:33.047 --> 28:36.317
I'm not looking for any trouble.
Put the guns down.

28:41.855 --> 28:44.391
Bastard!

29:12.853 --> 29:14.221
Don't waste the ammo.

31:33.427 --> 31:35.563
<i>John? John?</i>

31:35.996 --> 31:38.365
<i>John? John? John? John?
John? John?</i>

31:38.399 --> 31:39.634
John? John?

31:39.667 --> 31:41.402
Wake up. Wake up, John.

31:43.705 --> 31:45.339
- What's going on?
- We need you.

31:48.041 --> 31:49.042
Yeah.

31:51.111 --> 31:52.112
Okay.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.589
Hey guys.

32:02.456 --> 32:04.024
Go ahead, Lewis.

32:04.057 --> 32:05.192
Tell him what you heard.

32:07.194 --> 32:09.229
Scanning through the channels
like I always do.

32:10.464 --> 32:13.434
And I came across
this communication.

32:14.201 --> 32:16.069
Could barely make it out,
and I...

32:16.504 --> 32:19.440
You know, it's just
better if I play it for you.

32:28.148 --> 32:30.951
<i>I repeat, we're under attack!</i>

32:33.187 --> 32:36.089
<i>Something, scabs,
they're here!</i>

32:37.257 --> 32:40.194
<i>They must have followed a
scouting party back to our camp.</i>

32:42.095 --> 32:44.632
<i>If there are any trace operatives
in the immediate vicinity,</i>

32:44.666 --> 32:47.100
<i>we need help!</i>

32:56.376 --> 32:58.245
Did you try
getting back to these guys?

32:59.379 --> 33:00.981
John, I've tried every channel.

33:01.348 --> 33:03.150
Every open line
of communication.

33:03.685 --> 33:04.752
I've just got static.

33:09.122 --> 33:10.123
Breakwater Creek.

33:11.793 --> 33:14.361
Breakwater Creek. Why do
I know Breakwater Creek?

33:15.362 --> 33:18.098
Isn't that... isn't that
the old fifth well station?

33:19.667 --> 33:21.168
We used to trade plants
and spring water

33:21.335 --> 33:22.704
with them a while back.

33:23.070 --> 33:24.071
Okay.

33:32.412 --> 33:33.413
Okay.

33:35.148 --> 33:36.149
John.

33:40.287 --> 33:41.689
What, you don't want
me going out now?

33:42.557 --> 33:45.058
I just don't understand
why another operative can't go.

33:46.761 --> 33:49.162
'Cause I'm pretty sure
we don't have any around.

42:20.341 --> 42:21.542
John to Lewis.

42:22.843 --> 42:23.878
John to Lewis.

42:25.212 --> 42:27.081
Lewis? John, do you read me?

42:32.153 --> 42:34.555
Lock the bunker down.
No one leaves.

42:36.157 --> 42:37.892
I'm on my way back.
Lewis, do you read?

42:41.962 --> 42:44.131
Lewis, I'm staring at
a trace map right now.

42:46.100 --> 42:48.969
And if these things didn't know
where we lived before,

42:50.304 --> 42:51.939
they sure as hell do right now.

42:59.313 --> 43:01.682
I'm on my way back. Over.

48:26.373 --> 48:27.374
What's this?

48:30.444 --> 48:31.445
Hi, John.

48:35.449 --> 48:38.285
It looks like a bladed weapon
of some sort.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.921
A bladed weapon of some sort?

48:43.323 --> 48:44.324
Are you kidding me?

48:45.727 --> 48:49.564
I've never seen anything
handcrafted like that before

48:50.063 --> 48:52.266
in all my tracing days.

48:53.568 --> 48:54.602
Where'd you...
where'd you find it?

48:55.469 --> 48:56.538
Are you kidding me?

48:57.438 --> 48:59.406
Ye... yeah, where'd you find it?

49:00.040 --> 49:03.578
Where did I find...? I found that
at a marauder camp.

49:04.178 --> 49:06.581
These scabs are
making their own weapons.

49:06.614 --> 49:10.618
They're crafting
their own fucking weapons.

49:11.619 --> 49:13.721
I haven't heard any chatter
on the radio about this.

49:13.755 --> 49:15.723
I haven't heard anything
from any other camps.

49:15.757 --> 49:18.693
That's your job.
That's exactly what you should be doing.

49:18.726 --> 49:19.727
You should be on the radio.

49:20.829 --> 49:22.463
You should know these things.
I'm going out there.

49:22.496 --> 49:24.699
I'm naked. I have no idea.

49:24.732 --> 49:27.334
And yet these scabs
are out there now creating,

49:27.367 --> 49:29.737
crafting their own weaponry.

49:29.771 --> 49:31.271
You're supposed to be
on top of this!

49:31.438 --> 49:33.608
I'm going out there.
I'm risking my life.

49:33.641 --> 49:36.310
I'm risking the lives of
everybody here in this bunker.

49:36.343 --> 49:38.646
And that's what I gotta
go out and find?

49:39.346 --> 49:40.748
What are you worried about
bladed weapons for?

49:40.782 --> 49:44.619
You got guns and explosives
and all sorts of technology.

49:45.285 --> 49:47.187
They're making it on their own!

49:47.221 --> 49:49.456
I mean, how do you know it was
the scabs and not the marauders?

49:49.490 --> 49:51.992
You said it yourself,
you found it in a marauder camp.

49:54.662 --> 49:56.296
I don't know.

49:58.131 --> 50:01.034
I'm going out there.
This is your job.

50:01.201 --> 50:02.637
You need to be on that thing.

50:02.670 --> 50:04.606
That is what you do.

50:04.639 --> 50:06.139
That is what you do.

50:07.074 --> 50:08.610
I mean, there has been
some chatter on the radio

50:08.643 --> 50:11.411
of some refugees gone missing
past couple of weeks.

50:12.079 --> 50:15.215
I mean, that...
that does seem to connect,

50:15.249 --> 50:16.416
to make a little bit of sense.

50:17.484 --> 50:20.020
Lewis, goddammit,
they're handcrafting weaponry!

50:21.121 --> 50:23.390
They're evolving!
Can you imagine if they get their hands

50:23.423 --> 50:25.760
on guns and explosives?

50:26.694 --> 50:28.028
- Jesus.
- No.

50:29.531 --> 50:30.665
No.

50:30.698 --> 50:33.467
This, you, me,
everything we're doing,

50:33.500 --> 50:34.602
the whole bunker,

50:34.636 --> 50:36.671
done and dusted.

50:36.704 --> 50:41.108
I... this bunker is done!

50:41.141 --> 50:43.443
These lives that
we're trying to protect

50:43.811 --> 50:44.612
are for naught!

50:46.614 --> 50:47.849
John, how long
have you been out there?

50:47.882 --> 50:49.182
Three days!

50:51.719 --> 50:52.720
John, you look like shit.

50:53.220 --> 50:54.354
You need some rest.

50:54.722 --> 50:56.524
You're no good to us dead.

51:03.798 --> 51:05.198
You do your job, John.

51:06.734 --> 51:07.735
Protect us.

57:31.018 --> 57:32.620
You wear the colors.

57:35.723 --> 57:36.991
You wear the armor.

57:37.959 --> 57:39.193
You must know the words.

57:40.261 --> 57:41.562
Convince me you're not a thief

57:41.595 --> 57:43.731
who just stole
some soldier's uniform.

57:44.765 --> 57:45.900
I'm John T Wrecker.

57:46.968 --> 57:50.470
Identification number 00324.

57:51.272 --> 57:52.673
This is my quadrant.

57:53.874 --> 57:54.875
This is my sector.

57:58.179 --> 58:00.480
I trained
in the Anchorage facility.

58:03.617 --> 58:05.252
I trained
in the Anchorage facility.

58:05.286 --> 58:08.723
John T Wrecker. 00324.

58:08.756 --> 58:11.258
This is my quadrant.
This is my sector.

58:13.761 --> 58:15.262
And how long
you been hunting for?

58:18.165 --> 58:19.400
I don't know.

58:30.177 --> 58:31.712
None of us do.

58:34.015 --> 58:35.916
You don't wanna go in there.

01:00:50.284 --> 01:00:51.719
Well there's problems
to the north,

01:00:51.752 --> 01:00:52.920
as I'm sure you've heard.

01:00:58.025 --> 01:00:59.026
Thanks.

01:01:01.328 --> 01:01:02.329
Yeah, I've heard.

01:01:04.498 --> 01:01:06.133
A lot of missing people.

01:01:11.939 --> 01:01:13.440
Is that what brings you
around this way?

01:01:16.911 --> 01:01:18.112
Yeah, for the most part.

01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:24.318
Plus there's been shortages
of ammunition

01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:25.352
for quite some time.

01:01:28.489 --> 01:01:30.791
Pretty sure that's been
a problem for us,

01:01:31.225 --> 01:01:36.130
for everyone, everywhere,
for quite some time.

01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:43.103
So what's your situation
down in this sector?

01:01:46.941 --> 01:01:48.209
I'm starting to notice
the scabs are fewer

01:01:48.242 --> 01:01:49.143
and farther between.

01:01:52.846 --> 01:01:54.715
Well, that's different
from my experiences.

01:01:55.249 --> 01:01:57.184
- Pardon?
- Scabs, I've...

01:01:59.019 --> 01:02:00.888
I've seen them migrate
a little bit more.

01:02:02.022 --> 01:02:03.057
Migrate?

01:02:04.391 --> 01:02:06.360
- Like a herd?
- Something like that.

01:02:09.997 --> 01:02:11.031
That makes sense.

01:02:13.133 --> 01:02:14.134
Go on.

01:02:17.838 --> 01:02:19.873
There's something new out there,
from what I gather.

01:02:21.008 --> 01:02:22.209
Yeah, there's been
a few instances

01:02:22.243 --> 01:02:24.345
where I've run into
some survivors who...

01:02:25.479 --> 01:02:26.981
who've been to camps
with missing people

01:02:27.014 --> 01:02:28.749
and in the way those camps
have been...

01:02:30.552 --> 01:02:31.885
attacked is...

01:02:33.887 --> 01:02:35.055
It's different.

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:39.126
Yeah. I'm starting
to notice that too.

01:02:41.028 --> 01:02:42.029
How do you mean?

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:44.532
I'm checking out these camps

01:02:45.432 --> 01:02:47.268
and there are no bodies
to be found.

01:02:51.539 --> 01:02:55.009
There's no way that one of
these creatures, these monsters,

01:02:55.909 --> 01:02:57.512
whatever you wanna call it,
these scabs,

01:02:57.545 --> 01:03:00.314
there's no way that
they can do that by themselves.

01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:04.451
These things
are next to invincible.

01:03:06.186 --> 01:03:07.522
You can barely kill 'em.

01:03:09.456 --> 01:03:10.491
And now I'm starting
to think they're not

01:03:10.858 --> 01:03:11.925
working alone anymore.

01:03:15.195 --> 01:03:17.532
And I'm thinking if we can get
a group of people together,

01:03:17.565 --> 01:03:19.066
prepare them properly,

01:03:20.602 --> 01:03:22.570
that we can all work together
and we can take them out.

01:03:22.604 --> 01:03:24.204
- No.
- Yes.

01:03:24.471 --> 01:03:25.806
We need your help.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:27.975
I need your help.

01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:29.943
No.

01:03:29.977 --> 01:03:31.312
- Yes.
- No.

01:03:31.345 --> 01:03:34.582
Why not? We need help.
We need to work together.

01:03:34.616 --> 01:03:37.251
We have to bring everybody,
side-by-side

01:03:37.284 --> 01:03:39.820
and start picking them off
like they're picking us off.

01:03:40.988 --> 01:03:43.190
- It could work. Yes.
- No.

01:03:43.223 --> 01:03:45.025
- Why not?
- Because.

01:03:45.059 --> 01:03:46.927
- Because what?
- Because you know.

01:03:47.629 --> 01:03:50.598
You know we're depleted,
you know we have no ammunitions.

01:03:50.632 --> 01:03:53.033
Why do you think
I'm walking around here?

01:03:53.067 --> 01:03:54.902
I lost my entire camp.

01:03:59.373 --> 01:04:01.909
And you think that
you can just kill all these?

01:04:03.243 --> 01:04:05.112
With what? What do you have?

01:04:05.647 --> 01:04:08.516
Three clips?
How many clips do you have?

01:04:09.249 --> 01:04:10.217
- How many clips?
- Three.

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:11.519
- You have three clips?
- I have three clips.

01:04:11.553 --> 01:04:13.521
You have three clips.

01:04:15.255 --> 01:04:16.624
They've told you.

01:04:16.658 --> 01:04:18.225
We've ran out of soldiers.

01:04:18.258 --> 01:04:21.261
We have no supplies.
We have no ammunitions.

01:04:21.663 --> 01:04:23.163
What do you expect?

01:04:23.197 --> 01:04:24.865
I'm expecting to do something.

01:04:26.934 --> 01:04:27.901
It's not gonna wor...

01:04:27.935 --> 01:04:29.370
I'm not gonna sit around here
and just die.

01:04:29.403 --> 01:04:31.205
Well, it's not gonna work. Okay?

01:04:31.238 --> 01:04:33.374
So do me a favor,
pack your shit,

01:04:33.407 --> 01:04:35.876
and when I come back, be gone.
Understand?

01:04:44.017 --> 01:04:45.252
Yeah, I understand.

01:04:55.028 --> 01:04:57.231
<i>John.
I was just about to call you.</i>

01:04:58.165 --> 01:05:00.000
I'm just happy
to be counted, sir.

01:05:01.001 --> 01:05:02.503
It's easy to think
you've been forgotten

01:05:03.303 --> 01:05:07.040
when you're left out here in
this pretty piece of the world.

01:05:09.042 --> 01:05:10.678
<i>Oh, no. Quite the contrary.</i>

01:05:10.712 --> 01:05:12.146
<i>There's a lot of activity
going on</i>

01:05:12.179 --> 01:05:13.447
<i>in your neck of the woods.</i>

01:05:17.151 --> 01:05:19.319
I just received
a video transmission

01:05:19.721 --> 01:05:21.488
that was sent over six days ago.

01:05:22.456 --> 01:05:24.324
<i>Yes. 227.</i>

01:05:25.058 --> 01:05:26.594
And what's the status
on that, General?

01:05:27.428 --> 01:05:30.364
<i>Yeah, they've been dark
for over 24 hours.</i>

01:05:31.599 --> 01:05:33.033
They've been dark?

01:05:33.434 --> 01:05:35.302
<i>We can assume
they've been overrun.</i>

01:05:36.771 --> 01:05:38.338
<i>Give me a sit rep, John.</i>

01:05:39.072 --> 01:05:41.074
<i>What's the climate like
over in your quadrant?</i>

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:44.612
Pretty typical
until a few days ago.

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:51.018
Some scavenging scabs,
poaching refugees, marauders.

01:05:51.619 --> 01:05:53.721
I tracked them.
I took care of it.

01:05:55.055 --> 01:05:56.023
And then you know what happened?

01:05:57.391 --> 01:05:59.460
<i>And then you saw
this new breed, huh?</i>

01:05:59.493 --> 01:06:01.629
Yeah, I did.

01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:05.199
<i>Scabs have always been tough.</i>

01:06:05.232 --> 01:06:07.468
<i>Their biological makeup
stresses their cells</i>

01:06:07.501 --> 01:06:09.203
<i>and nerve endings,
but we've always known</i>

01:06:09.236 --> 01:06:11.004
<i>and dealt with the fact
that they're hard to kill,</i>

01:06:11.371 --> 01:06:16.076
<i>but this new breed
is much more... trying.</i>

01:06:18.613 --> 01:06:21.749
How many trace operatives
have we lost recently, sir?

01:06:22.684 --> 01:06:24.351
<i>Look, John,
you know as well as I do</i>

01:06:24.384 --> 01:06:26.320
<i>that our numbers
are dwindling.</i>

01:06:26.353 --> 01:06:28.590
<i>Especially since the Red Road
rose up back east</i>

01:06:28.623 --> 01:06:31.124
<i>and started their own
personal war over territory.</i>

01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:32.760
<i>They've actually conquered
quite a bit</i>

01:06:32.794 --> 01:06:35.362
<i>but we can't fight two wars
at once.</i>

01:06:35.797 --> 01:06:38.999
Sir, how many?

01:06:40.133 --> 01:06:41.502
<i>I've got 16 operatives left</i>

01:06:41.536 --> 01:06:43.237
<i>on the entire
western seaboard.</i>

01:06:47.241 --> 01:06:50.612
<i>These new scabs,
they've been watching us,</i>

01:06:50.645 --> 01:06:52.145
<i>waiting, it would appear.</i>

01:06:53.681 --> 01:06:55.182
<i>Still primitive
in their fashion</i>

01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:56.584
<i>of using bladed weaponry,</i>

01:06:56.618 --> 01:07:00.287
<i>but they're communicating,
coordinating attacks.</i>

01:07:02.422 --> 01:07:05.560
<i>They've killed over 50
operatives in the last 10 days.</i>

01:07:07.094 --> 01:07:08.663
<i>Who knows how many refugees?</i>

01:07:08.696 --> 01:07:11.031
<i>Hundreds,
maybe even a thousand.</i>

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.169
Well, I have reason to believe we
have two of those scabs out here,

01:07:17.437 --> 01:07:20.508
and I'm fairly certain
that they know

01:07:20.542 --> 01:07:22.075
where our bunker is located.

01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.515
<i>Then they'll come
for you, John.</i>

01:07:28.583 --> 01:07:30.050
<i>What's your inventory like?</i>

01:07:33.555 --> 01:07:35.823
Low. Yeah.

01:07:37.324 --> 01:07:38.158
Always low.

01:07:40.193 --> 01:07:42.496
Although I'm sure
I could fashion together

01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:43.598
whatever we needed.

01:07:44.799 --> 01:07:48.368
Do a quick MacGyver
if necessary.

01:07:49.604 --> 01:07:51.305
Everything else
is peachy though.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.375
<i>We've been working on
something in the lab.</i>

01:07:55.409 --> 01:07:58.178
<i>Desperate times call for
desperate measures, right?</i>

01:07:58.211 --> 01:08:00.213
<i>I may have something
that could work.</i>

01:08:00.715 --> 01:08:02.449
<i>Can you get to an airdrop
if I can manage</i>

01:08:02.482 --> 01:08:04.418
<i>to get something to you
within a few miles?</i>

01:08:07.555 --> 01:08:09.591
I think anything would help
at this point, sir.

01:08:11.726 --> 01:08:13.093
<i>Okay.</i>

01:08:14.394 --> 01:08:15.730
<i>I've got one available helo
with enough extra fuel</i>

01:08:15.763 --> 01:08:17.331
<i>for a slight detour.</i>

01:08:18.633 --> 01:08:20.100
<i>I'll send you the coordinates
through the telecom.</i>

01:08:21.368 --> 01:08:22.269
<i>Hell, I'll even throw in
something from the old war</i>

01:08:22.435 --> 01:08:23.437
<i>that might help.</i>

01:08:24.203 --> 01:08:25.640
I appreciate it.

01:08:27.374 --> 01:08:29.209
<i>You'll know
what to do with it.</i>

01:08:29.242 --> 01:08:31.578
<i>But John, only take a dose</i>

01:08:31.613 --> 01:08:33.479
<i>if you know
you're in for a battle.</i>

01:08:34.348 --> 01:08:35.515
<i>You understand
what I'm saying?</i>

01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:38.151
Yes, sir.

01:08:39.419 --> 01:08:40.688
<i>Look, I can't make
any promises about this stuff,</i>

01:08:41.956 --> 01:08:43.357
<i>but it works, then luck's
gonna be on our side.</i>

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.595
<i>Good luck, soldier.</i>

01:16:53.848 --> 01:16:56.117
<i>After receiving the care
package from General Taylor,</i>

01:16:56.150 --> 01:16:57.284
<i>I headed back to camp.</i>

01:16:58.686 --> 01:17:00.888
<i>It was refreshing fighting
something more human than not,</i>

01:17:01.422 --> 01:17:04.692
<i>but nothing about it felt...
human.</i>

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.962
<i>Killing to be able to kill.</i>

01:17:09.598 --> 01:17:13.067
<i>I know Grace or... or Lewis would
have something to say about it,</i>

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:17.271
<i>but if they asked me
right now what I thought,</i>

01:17:17.304 --> 01:17:19.006
<i>I'd tell 'em
straight to their faces</i>

01:17:19.039 --> 01:17:22.009
<i>that I'm glad
it's in our hands now.</i>

01:17:22.042 --> 01:17:23.844
<i>Wrecker,
can you hear me? Come in.</i>

01:17:24.278 --> 01:17:26.180
<i>Listen, I don't know
if you can talk</i>

01:17:27.181 --> 01:17:28.349
<i>but you got to
understand something.</i>

01:17:28.382 --> 01:17:29.717
<i>Grace went out
looking for you.</i>

01:17:30.184 --> 01:17:31.285
<i>She hasn't come back.</i>

01:17:32.319 --> 01:17:33.787
<i>I think she's gone missing.</i>

01:19:43.384 --> 01:19:44.653
<i>Hello, John.</i>

01:19:44.686 --> 01:19:47.087
<i>I was just given some
information about your post.</i>

01:19:47.855 --> 01:19:50.324
<i>Lewis, he's a good soldier.</i>

01:19:53.193 --> 01:19:54.529
<i>Anyway, he's a good asset.</i>

01:19:58.566 --> 01:20:00.000
<i>Did you get the package?</i>

01:20:10.277 --> 01:20:12.179
<i>Everyone is a soldier
at this point.</i>

01:20:12.212 --> 01:20:13.914
<i>We're fighting
a losing battle.</i>

01:20:15.049 --> 01:20:17.552
<i>And I need to know
if what I gave you works.</i>

01:20:18.452 --> 01:20:19.820
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

01:20:21.623 --> 01:20:24.458
<i>You've always been one of the
best soldiers in my arsenal.</i>

01:20:30.164 --> 01:20:33.033
<i>Humanity needs every man
and woman we can muster.</i>

01:20:33.467 --> 01:20:34.468
<i>You understand me?</i>

01:21:09.370 --> 01:21:11.205
I see you had no problem
finding me again.

01:21:16.544 --> 01:21:17.945
What is it? What's wrong?

01:21:23.150 --> 01:21:24.619
I lost something today.

01:21:28.989 --> 01:21:30.457
Well, I guess that's something
you're just going

01:21:30.491 --> 01:21:31.559
to have to get used to.

01:21:43.036 --> 01:21:44.037
Shit.

01:21:47.575 --> 01:21:49.309
It was August, or I...

01:21:50.645 --> 01:21:52.312
think it was,
I have no fucking clue.

01:21:54.415 --> 01:21:56.417
There were two men
in my quadrant.

01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:58.118
We lost Miller a few months ago.

01:22:00.187 --> 01:22:02.423
Son of a bitch didn't even die
by one of those scumbags,

01:22:02.456 --> 01:22:04.425
he had pneumonia,
if you can believe that shit.

01:22:07.428 --> 01:22:09.129
Anyway, I was outpost
for a couple of days

01:22:09.163 --> 01:22:13.267
and when I got back...
camp was destroyed.

01:22:17.104 --> 01:22:19.473
No bodies, no bones.

01:22:22.276 --> 01:22:24.211
Just the smell of death
and evidence of slaughter.

01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:30.184
Did you go out
and look for anyone?

01:22:31.185 --> 01:22:32.587
What difference would that make?

01:22:34.321 --> 01:22:35.322
I know they were dead.

01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:38.425
Being eaten
off somewhere in the dark.

01:22:39.761 --> 01:22:40.961
I failed my mission.

01:22:44.198 --> 01:22:45.733
This is
a different type of Hunter.

01:22:49.169 --> 01:22:50.572
All right?
They're still animalistic but...

01:22:52.105 --> 01:22:53.641
they're starting to remember
that they're human.

01:22:55.643 --> 01:22:57.211
They're starting to remember
the English language.

01:22:57.244 --> 01:22:59.046
And I'm not talking about
grunts or scribbles.

01:22:59.079 --> 01:23:01.549
I'm talking about they're
starting to learn how to write.

01:23:02.617 --> 01:23:05.486
Yeah. And I've seen that too.

01:23:06.521 --> 01:23:08.288
More than one
is just impossible.

01:23:09.757 --> 01:23:10.758
It's impossible.

01:23:13.661 --> 01:23:15.229
That's why I have one of these.

01:23:18.198 --> 01:23:20.000
'Cause you need
one hell of a punch.

01:23:24.404 --> 01:23:25.740
The doctors
wanted a sample of them.

01:23:25.773 --> 01:23:27.509
They just don't have
the resources anymore.

01:23:27.542 --> 01:23:30.778
So now it's just every man,
woman, and child

01:23:30.812 --> 01:23:32.246
fending for themselves.

01:23:37.351 --> 01:23:39.554
Some reason I think God
just fucking hates us.

01:23:44.559 --> 01:23:45.693
Well, I need your help.

01:23:47.829 --> 01:23:49.531
No one else has the training.

01:23:49.564 --> 01:23:51.498
No one else knows
how to use the firepower.

01:23:51.533 --> 01:23:55.570
Plus maybe...
you and your death wish

01:23:56.871 --> 01:23:58.105
wouldn't hurt us.

01:24:02.577 --> 01:24:04.512
Now is a chance for you
to redeem yourself.

01:24:05.713 --> 01:24:07.114
Whether you want to or not,

01:24:07.147 --> 01:24:09.316
you have an obligation
to the oath,

01:24:10.183 --> 01:24:12.587
to the people
that you swore to protect,

01:24:14.187 --> 01:24:17.424
to get big where others hide
and they get small.

01:24:19.259 --> 01:24:21.563
You wear those colors
because you honor those

01:24:21.596 --> 01:24:22.730
who came before you.

01:24:24.364 --> 01:24:27.702
Honor them by fighting
in their memory,

01:24:27.735 --> 01:24:30.237
fighting for the ones
that you swore to protect.

01:24:33.273 --> 01:24:34.576
I'm going back to my post.

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:38.613
And if you feel like
completing your mission,

01:24:40.314 --> 01:24:41.749
you know where to find me.

01:27:45.533 --> 01:27:46.768
<i>You still recording?</i>

01:27:46.801 --> 01:27:48.669
<i>Commander is gonna wanna see
these things in CQC.</i>

01:27:48.703 --> 01:27:50.337
<i>Keep it rolling, Wrecker.</i>

01:29:33.507 --> 01:29:34.909
A limb for a limb.

01:31:21.716 --> 01:31:26.921
<i>This is John Wrecker,
Trace Operative, Station 222.</i>

01:31:28.756 --> 01:31:29.790
<i>We have disbanded</i>

01:31:31.525 --> 01:31:35.763
<i>and I've sent what little survivors
we had left to another outpost.</i>

01:31:36.230 --> 01:31:41.102
<i>One where hopefully
they can find safety.</i>

01:31:41.902 --> 01:31:43.771
<i>On the orders
of General Taylor,</i>

01:31:44.772 --> 01:31:45.740
<i>I was given a serum</i>

01:31:47.675 --> 01:31:49.510
<i>and I wanna confirm
that it worked.</i>

01:31:50.311 --> 01:31:54.949
<i>No pain and a surge of
adrenaline overtakes the body.</i>

01:31:55.816 --> 01:31:59.787
<i>It is my hope and
my belief that this serum</i>

01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:03.190
<i>will put us on a level playing
field with those scabs.</i>

01:32:05.026 --> 01:32:08.029
<i>I've killed two of 'em,
this new breed,</i>

01:32:08.929 --> 01:32:11.065
<i>but I am certain that
there are more out there.</i>

01:32:12.066 --> 01:32:14.935
<i>I no longer consider
this outpost my home.</i>

01:32:15.936 --> 01:32:18.839
<i>And I believe that
I've found a new purpose,</i>

01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:20.941
<i>a new mission,</i>

01:32:22.109 --> 01:32:24.545
<i>not to protect just one place
in particular,</i>

01:32:26.647 --> 01:32:30.684
<i>but to roam Pacifica
and wage new war</i>

01:32:31.152 --> 01:32:32.787
<i>on this new breed of hunter.</i>

01:32:33.888 --> 01:32:37.024
<i>This is John T Wrecker
signing off.</i>
