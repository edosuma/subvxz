WEBVTT

00:03.960 --> 00:06.093
YOU GUYS,
THIS IS TOO MUCH.

00:06.223 --> 00:07.616
IT'S NOT TOO MUCH.

00:07.746 --> 00:08.965
YOU'D DO THE SAME FOR US.

00:11.054 --> 00:13.230
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT,
BUT...

00:13.361 --> 00:14.579
THIS IS--

00:14.710 --> 00:15.972
THIS IS GREAT.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.235
IT'S GOOD. IT'S GOOD
TO BE HOME.

00:18.366 --> 00:19.758
FINALLY.

00:19.889 --> 00:22.239
COME ON, IT'S GOOD.
I'M GOOD.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.241
DON'T I
LOOK GOOD?

00:24.372 --> 00:25.764
I'M PUTTING ON
SOME WEIGHT.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.767
I HAVE CURVES NOW...
AGAIN,

00:28.898 --> 00:30.247
WHICH IS NICE.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.075
MAYBE WE SHOULD
STAY WITH YOU TONIGHT.

00:32.206 --> 00:33.337
I MEAN,
WE COULD STAY, RIGHT?

00:33.468 --> 00:35.078
ABSOLUTELY, WE CAN STAY.

00:35.209 --> 00:36.427
NO. NO WAY.

00:36.558 --> 00:37.950
I AM GOOD.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.387
BESIDES, THE KIDS
ARE COMING
IN THE MORNING.

00:39.517 --> 00:40.823
I HAVE TO
GET UP EARLY.

00:44.305 --> 00:45.610
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN?

00:45.741 --> 00:47.786
OH, MY GOD, DO I?

00:47.917 --> 00:50.267
WE'RE GONNA GO FOR
A HIKE, LUNCH AT
THEIR FAVORITE

00:50.398 --> 00:51.616
BURGER PLACE.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.009
OH, AND THE BALL
GAME ON FRIDAY--

00:53.140 --> 00:54.619
NO, NO, NO, NO.
BONNIE...

00:54.750 --> 00:56.795
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN TO
GET THROUGH TONIGHT?

00:58.319 --> 01:01.409
I'VE GOT A LIST OF
PEOPLE I CAN CALL.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.802
BON, YOU NEED
MORE THAN A LIST.

01:03.933 --> 01:06.153
WHY DIDN'T THEY PUT
YOU ON SUBOXONE?

01:06.283 --> 01:10.070
THEY DID. I WANTED
TO GET OFF OF IT.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.202
BECAUSE, YEAH,
IT HELPS, BUT...

01:12.333 --> 01:14.813
AT A CERTAIN POINT,
IT'S JUST ANOTHER DRUG

01:14.944 --> 01:16.293
YOU HAVE TO KICK.
RIGHT?

01:16.424 --> 01:19.340
I'LL BE FINE.
I PROMISE.

01:29.872 --> 01:34.746
I LOVE YOU, AND I'M
PROUD OF YOU. OK?

01:34.877 --> 01:36.357
OK.

01:38.359 --> 01:40.317
AND I LOVE YOU, TOO.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.319
OK.

01:42.450 --> 01:43.886
BYE.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.368
BYE.

01:49.370 --> 01:53.069
LEWIS: AND THAT IS WHY THE BAU
FINDS THAT RECIDIVISM RATES

01:53.200 --> 01:55.811
CAPTURE ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE
OF ALL OF THE CRIMES

01:55.941 --> 01:57.595
THAT REPEAT
SEX OFFENDERS COMMIT.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.119
SO, WHAT CAN WE DO?

02:00.946 --> 02:04.646
WELL, FOR STARTERS, WE
CAN WORK TO ADDRESS THE
BACKLOG OF... RAPE KITS

02:04.776 --> 02:07.997
AT THE STATE
AND LOCAL LEVELS.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.477
THIS IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT

02:09.607 --> 02:11.827
OF FORENSIC EVIDENCE THAT
WE CAN USE TO STUDY THEM,

02:11.957 --> 02:13.959
THEIR PATTERNS,
THEIR HABITS,

02:14.090 --> 02:18.181
SO THAT THEY CAN NEVER HURT
ANYONE AGAIN.

02:18.312 --> 02:20.183
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.

02:20.314 --> 02:21.924
GOOD NIGHT.

02:25.101 --> 02:27.408
WOMAN: THANK YOU SO MUCH.THANK YOU. THANKS
FOR COMING. THANK YOU.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.412
THAT WAS A
GREAT PRESENTATION.

02:31.542 --> 02:33.936
YOU ONLY SAW THE
LAST 30 SECONDS.

02:34.066 --> 02:36.373
WELL,
I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.941
THE TED TALK YOU GAVE
IS ON YOUTUBE.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.815
"DARYL? WOW,
IT'S BEEN 15 YEARS.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.382
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?"

02:45.513 --> 02:47.428
"WELL, I GOT MY
DOCTORATE FINALLY."

02:47.558 --> 02:48.907
"YOU DID?"
"YEAH, I DID

02:49.038 --> 02:50.561
IN ADDICTION
TREATMENT MODALITIES."

02:50.692 --> 02:52.389
"WOW, THAT'S GREAT.
GOOD FOR YOU." "THANKS."

02:52.520 --> 02:54.913
LISTEN, I SAW YOUR
NAME ON THE VISITING
SPEAKER LIST, SO--

02:55.044 --> 02:57.742
WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME
FOR JUST A SECOND?

02:57.873 --> 02:59.440
HANDS OFF.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.226
I NEED YOUR HELP.

03:03.357 --> 03:08.405
WELL, I'VE HEARD
THAT ONE BEFORE, DARYL.

03:08.536 --> 03:09.972
GOOD NIGHT.

03:13.454 --> 03:15.020
LOOK, THIS
ISN'T ABOUT ME.

03:15.151 --> 03:18.067
I'VE BEEN WORKING IN RECOVERY
AND PEOPLE ARE OVERDOSING.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.808
WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT YOU
KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE,

03:19.938 --> 03:21.244
THAT IS A PART OF THE
DISEASE OF ADDICTION.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.593
YEAH, IT IS, BUT THIS
IS DIFFERENT.

03:22.724 --> 03:25.422
I THINK SOMEONE'S
KILLING THEM.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.207
DID YOU TALK TO THE LAPD?

03:27.337 --> 03:28.686
YEAH, I DID,
AND THEY GAVE ME

03:28.817 --> 03:31.428
A COLDER SHOULDER
THAN YOU JUST DID.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.735
LOOK. GIVE ME 5 MINUTES?

03:33.865 --> 03:35.258
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT I'VE FOUND,

03:35.389 --> 03:38.174
SCIENTIST TO SCIENTIST.

03:38.305 --> 03:39.697
YOU GOT MARRIED.

03:39.828 --> 03:42.657
YEAH. I DID.
LAST YEAR.

03:42.787 --> 03:46.443
GOOD FOR YOU.
I MEAN IT.

03:46.574 --> 03:51.013
UM, SHE'S ACTUALLY THE
ONE THAT SUGGESTED THAT
I REACH OUT TO YOU.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.713
5 MINUTES.

03:55.844 --> 03:58.542
GREAT. MY OFFICE IS
RIGHT ACROSS CAMPUS.

04:40.062 --> 04:43.021
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.

04:43.152 --> 04:45.633
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.

04:45.763 --> 04:48.853
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.508
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.

04:51.639 --> 04:54.032
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.

04:54.163 --> 04:56.034
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.302
HI. IT'S ME.

05:02.432 --> 05:08.264
UM...I'M NOT...
I'M NOT FEELIN' SO HOT.

05:08.395 --> 05:11.528
I WAS WONDERING, UH...

05:11.659 --> 05:14.052
COULD YOU COME OVER?

05:14.183 --> 05:15.576
LIKE RIGHT NOW?

05:18.709 --> 05:20.407
THANK YOU.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.540
PRENTISS: TARA, GO AHEAD.
WE'RE ALL HERE.

05:23.671 --> 05:26.282
GUYS, THANKS FOR COMING
IN. I KNOW IT'S LATE.

05:26.413 --> 05:30.373
THERE'S BEEN A STRANGE SPIKE
IN QUESTIONABLE OPIATE OVERDOSE
DEATHS HERE IN LOS ANGELES,

05:30.504 --> 05:31.983
AND I THINK IT'S
WORTH US TAKING A LOOK.

05:32.114 --> 05:34.377
WE ARE RIGHT NOW.
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

05:34.508 --> 05:36.553
LEWIS: WELL, OF THE MOST
RECENT CLUSTER OF ODs,

05:36.684 --> 05:38.555
THERE ARE 7 CASES
THAT LOOK SUSPICIOUS.

05:38.686 --> 05:41.253
ALL OF THEM DIED
WITHIN 24 HOURS OF
COMPLETING REHAB.

05:41.384 --> 05:44.735
ROSSI: THERE ARE A LOT
OF EXPLANATIONS BESIDES
HOMICIDE, THOUGH.

05:44.866 --> 05:48.565
YEAH, MOST ADDICTS GO
BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL DOSE
FROM BEFORE THEY KICKED.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.088
AND THEIR BODIES
CAN'T TOLERATE IT.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.220
THEY GO INTO SHOCK.

05:52.656 --> 05:53.701
OR THEIR HEROIN COULD BE LACED
WITH FENTANYL, WHICH IS

05:53.831 --> 05:55.746
50 TO 500 TIMES
MORE POTENT.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.879
THEY ONLY USE A LITTLE,
AND THAT'S ALL IT
TAKES TO KILL THEM.

05:58.009 --> 06:00.795
EXCEPT WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT HEROIN USERS HERE.

06:00.925 --> 06:05.495
ARM TIED OFF, FRESH
NEEDLE MARKS, COMPLETE
SYSTEM SHUTDOWN.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.410
THEY LOOK LIKE HEROIN
OVERDOSES TO ME.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.630
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
REASON THEY WENT TO REHAB
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.285
THEY ALL CHECKED IN FOR
DIFFERENT PROBLEMS: COCAINE,
METHAMPHETAMINE, ALCOHOL.

06:13.416 --> 06:16.114
BUT AFTER TREATMENT, THEY ALL
DIED OF A HEROIN OVERDOSE.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.073
AT LEAST THAT'S THE PATTERN
THAT WAS PRESENTED TO ME.

06:18.203 --> 06:19.204
ROSSI: THAT IS ODD.

06:20.641 --> 06:23.121
MOST ADDICTS RELAPSE ON THEIR
ORIGINAL DRUG OF CHOICE.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.601
TARA, WHO PRESENTED
THIS CASE TO YOU?

06:26.603 --> 06:29.954
UH...A DR. DARYL WRIGHT.

06:30.085 --> 06:32.740
HE'S MY...HE'S
MY EX-HUSBAND.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.219
HE'S YOUR
WHAT WHAT WHAT?

06:34.350 --> 06:37.222
LEWIS: LOOK, GUYS, IF THERE'S
NO CASE, THERE'S NO CASE,

06:37.353 --> 06:39.442
BUT I STILL WOULD
LIKE TO INVESTIGATE
THIS ON MY OWN.

06:39.573 --> 06:42.619
NO, YOU HAVE A CASE.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.492
SO...TARA WAS MARRIED?

06:53.195 --> 06:55.153
PLEASE...

06:55.284 --> 06:57.155
IT'S...

06:57.286 --> 06:58.679
IT'S TOO MUCH.

07:21.702 --> 07:24.661
DON'T LEAVE.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.184
DON'T LEAVE ME.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.231
DON'T...

08:19.411 --> 08:20.587
LEWIS: "IF YOU
DON'T KNOW SOMEONE

08:20.717 --> 08:23.285
WHO'S HAD A PROBLEM WITH
ADDICTION, YOU WILL."

08:23.415 --> 08:25.287
DANA BOENTE.

08:25.417 --> 08:28.290
PRENTISS: SO THE CHALLENGE
OF THIS CASE IS DETERMINING
IF THESE VICTIMS

08:28.420 --> 08:30.945
ARE OVERDOSING BY THEIR OWN HAND
OR AGAINST THEIR WILL.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.468
ANY OVERLAP, GARCIA?

08:32.599 --> 08:34.557
GARCIA: SO, AS YOU KNOW,
ALL 7 MEN AND WOMEN DIED

08:34.688 --> 08:39.606
WITHIN A DAY OF COMPLETING
VARIOUS INPATIENT
ADDICTION TREATMENTS,

08:39.736 --> 08:41.303
BUT THAT'S THE ONLY
COMMON DENOMINATOR.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.784
THE SPECTRUM OF TREATMENTS
IS BAFFLINGLY VARIED--

08:43.914 --> 08:46.743
FROM TRIED-AND-TRUE METHODS
TO EQUINE THERAPY AND HOT YOGA

08:46.874 --> 08:48.310
TO GET THE MONKEY OFF YOUR BACK.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.878
LESS 12-STEP
AND MORE DAY SPA.

08:51.008 --> 08:53.489
SIMMONS:
AND THERE WAS ONE CENTER
IN OKLAHOMA

08:53.620 --> 08:55.796
THAT FORCED ITS PATIENTS
TO WORK IN A CHICKEN COOP.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.406
BASICALLY INDENTURED
SERVITUDE.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.801
SINCE MOST INSURANCE
CARRIERS COVER REHAB,

09:00.931 --> 09:03.325
TREATMENT CENTERS HAVE BEEN
POPPING UP ALL OVER THE PLACE,

09:03.455 --> 09:05.806
ALL WITHOUT ANY CONSISTENT
MEDICAL STANDARDS.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.808
PRENTISS: THEN
ASSUMING WE HAVE AN UNSUB,

09:07.938 --> 09:10.332
HE HAS A TARGET-RICH
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH TO HUNT.

09:10.462 --> 09:13.378
HIS VICTIMS ARE VULNERABLE,
AND NOBODY BATS AN EYE
WHEN THEY O.D.

09:13.509 --> 09:17.992
GARCIA: I'VE JUST BEEN NOTIFIED
OF WHAT I THINK IS OUR MOST
RECENT POTENTIAL VICTIM.

09:18.122 --> 09:20.516
NAME IS BONNIE SULLIVAN.
I'M SENDING YOU INFORMATION NOW.

09:20.647 --> 09:25.608
J.J., DAVE, GO TO THE M.E.,
SEE IF SHE MATCHES OUR
VICTIMOLOGY.

09:25.739 --> 09:28.132
MATT, LUKE,
GO TO HER HOME.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.221
CONDUCT A PSYCHOLOGICAL
AUTOPSY.

09:30.352 --> 09:32.833
SEE IF SHE WAS SUSCEPTIBLE
TO OVERDOSE OR SUICIDE.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.704
I'LL SET UP WITH
THE L.A. DIVISION.

09:34.835 --> 09:37.838
WELL...BONNIE SULLIVAN
MAKES 8...

09:37.968 --> 09:39.317
UNFORTUNATELY.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.668
YEAH, AND BONNIE
WAS A TWEAKER.

09:41.798 --> 09:44.279
SHE'D GO OUT ON METH,
NOT HEROIN.

09:44.409 --> 09:46.890
WELL, THAT'S NOT
NECESSARILY TRUE.

09:47.021 --> 09:49.371
I MEAN, STIMULANT-
DEPRESSANT SPEEDBALLS
HAVE KILLED EVERYBODY

09:49.501 --> 09:51.416
FROM JOHN BELUSHI
TO PHILIP SEYMOUR HOFFMAN,

09:51.547 --> 09:54.071
BUT IT IS A PATTERN
THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE.

09:56.639 --> 09:59.642
DARYL, JUST CALL YOUR
WIFE BACK. IT'S FINE.

09:59.773 --> 10:00.861
IT'S NOT MY WIFE.

10:00.991 --> 10:02.384
IT'S--GUY I'M SPONSORING
WANTS TO KNOW

10:02.514 --> 10:04.212
IF I'VE HEARD ANYTHING
ABOUT SARAH.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.475
WAIT. SARAH FIELDING?
YOU KNOW HER?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.782
YEAH. I TOOK HER
THROUGH ALL 12 STEPS.

10:08.912 --> 10:12.002
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
SHE--SHE DIDN'T RELAPSE.

10:12.133 --> 10:15.876
THAT'S WHY I STARTED
LOOKING INTO THIS.

10:16.006 --> 10:19.357
SO YOU'RE FINALLY INTO
SPONSORING OTHER ADDICTS.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.229
THAT'S, UM--THAT'S GOOD.

10:21.359 --> 10:24.885
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN SOBER THIS TIME?

10:25.015 --> 10:26.843
5 YEARS.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.411
WHAT WAS IT THAT TOOK?

10:29.541 --> 10:30.934
I MET MY WIFE.

10:32.283 --> 10:33.894
SHE IN THE PROGRAM?

10:34.024 --> 10:37.680
NO. SHE'S A NORMIE,
AND...

10:37.811 --> 10:39.726
SHE CAN HAVE A GLASS
OF WINE LIKE
A NORMAL PERSON,

10:39.856 --> 10:42.163
AND IT DOESN'T
BOTHER ME.

10:42.293 --> 10:43.599
TARA, LOOK--

10:45.340 --> 10:47.734
YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS TOX
SCREEN ON BONNIE SULLIVAN,
IT'S--IT'S ODD.

10:47.864 --> 10:49.257
IS IT CONSISTENT
WITH THE OTHER VICTIMS?

10:49.387 --> 10:51.346
WHAT TOX SCREEN?

10:51.476 --> 10:55.089
THIS TOX SCREEN. IT
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

10:55.219 --> 10:57.831
YOU TESTED FOR
5 DOZEN OPIATES,

10:57.961 --> 10:59.920
AND YOU DIDN'T
GET A POSITIVE?

11:00.050 --> 11:03.271
NO. HER STOMACH CONTENTS
DID TEST POSITIVE FOR COFFEE

11:03.401 --> 11:05.186
MIXED WITH A BENZODIAZEPINE,

11:05.316 --> 11:06.840
BUT THAT WOULDN'T CAUSE
THE BODY TO SHUT DOWN LIKE THIS.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.450
JAREAU:
COULD BE HIS M.O.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.931
THE BENZO COULD MAKE HER
COMPLIANT ENOUGH

11:11.061 --> 11:14.151
FOR HIM TO INJECT HER
WITH WHATEVER IT IS HE'S USING.

11:14.282 --> 11:17.415
THAT BRINGS US TO OUR
SECOND SECRET DISCOVERY
OF THE DAY.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.463
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

11:21.593 --> 11:25.249
IT'S THE ONLY MARKING
ON HER WHOLE BODY, WHICH
IS ODD FOR ADDICTS WHO--

11:25.380 --> 11:26.990
SPEAKING IN GROSS
STEREOTYPES--

11:27.121 --> 11:29.645
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE
TO INK THEMSELVES.

11:29.776 --> 11:32.300
NONE OF THIS MEANS
IT WASN'T CONSENSUAL.

11:32.430 --> 11:37.479
THE COFFEE, THE BENZO,
THE HIDDEN DRUG,
THE HIDDEN TATTOO.

11:37.609 --> 11:40.700
EVEN IF SOMEONE
DID ALL THAT TO HER,
SHE MIGHT HAVE WANTED IT.

11:40.830 --> 11:43.485
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T
CALL IT HOMICIDE YET.

11:43.615 --> 11:44.660
WHEN IT COMES TO DRUGS,

11:46.140 --> 11:47.619
I'VE SEE MORE BIZARRE
DEATHS BY MISADVENTURE
THAN THIS.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.926
YEAH, SO HAVE WE.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.495
ALVEZ:
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

11:53.625 --> 11:55.453
SIMMONS:
WELL, NO SIGNS
OF A BREAK-IN.

11:55.584 --> 11:58.326
NO SIGNS OF
A STRUGGLE EITHER.

11:58.456 --> 11:59.588
YEAH, BUT LOOK AT THIS.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.287
GOT 3 TICKETS TO
TOMORROW NIGHT'S
LAKERS GAME.

12:03.418 --> 12:04.680
SHE HAS, WHAT, 2 KIDS?

12:04.811 --> 12:09.990
YEAH. GOT HIKING TODAY,
BASKETBALL GAME TOMORROW.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.208
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

12:12.732 --> 12:13.994
SHE WASN'T WITHDRAWING
FROM FAMILY OR
ISOLATING HERSELF--

12:14.124 --> 12:17.693
NO PRECURSOR BEHAVIOR
THAT WOULD POINT TO
SUICIDE OR RELAPSE.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.173
FUNNY THING ABOUT RELAPSE.

12:19.303 --> 12:21.001
SOMETIMES THERE'S
NO PRECURSOR.

12:21.131 --> 12:24.526
THAT'S WHY THEY SAY
YOU'RE POWERLESS
OVER YOUR DISEASE.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.615
LOOK AT THIS.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.836
BONNIE MADE A CALL
JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT.

12:29.966 --> 12:32.534
WELL, MIDNIGHT IS NOT
A GOOD TIME OF THE
NIGHT FOR MOST ADDICTS.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.275
NO. NO, IT'S NOT.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.581
SO WHO DID SHE CALL?

12:36.712 --> 12:38.627
MAN:
IT COULDN'T BE A DEALER.
HAS TO BE VINCENT.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.020
WHO'S VINCENT?

12:40.150 --> 12:41.369
HER OLD BOYFRIEND.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.023
HE'S THE ONE
THAT GOT HER ADDICTED.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.502
DO YOU HAVE A LAST NAME?

12:44.633 --> 12:47.984
NO. HE WAS ALWAYS
JUST "THAT BASTARD
VINCENT" TO ME.

12:48.115 --> 12:51.031
DOES VINCENT USE OR HAVE
ACCESS TO OPIATES?

12:51.161 --> 12:52.684
THEY APPEAR TO BE
THE CAUSE OF DEATH.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.164
NO. THEY ONLY
SMOKED METH TOGETHER.

12:54.295 --> 12:55.862
ARE YOU CERTAIN?

12:55.992 --> 12:57.951
SHE NEVER USED
INJECTION DRUGS?

12:58.081 --> 12:59.517
YEAH.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.389
BONNIE HATED NEEDLES.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.825
SHE WOULDN'T
TOUCH THEM.

13:02.956 --> 13:06.046
THANK YOU. THIS HAS BEEN
VERY HELPFUL.

13:06.176 --> 13:08.091
AGENT PRENTISS...

13:10.441 --> 13:14.097
HER KIDS.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.056
WHAT DO WE TELL THEM?

13:16.186 --> 13:18.493
WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE,
TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.106
BONNIE DIDN'T OVERDOSE
BY HER OWN HAND.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.806
SHE WAS MURDERED.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.550
MAN: WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS TO ME?

13:32.681 --> 13:33.856
SECOND MAN:
YOU'RE NOT DOING
THE WORK, CLAY.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.902
I'M DOING THE WORK.
MOLLY, TELL HIM!

13:36.032 --> 13:38.252
HE'S ON STEP 3.
HE'S SHARING.

13:38.382 --> 13:39.601
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT MORE YOU WANT.

13:39.731 --> 13:40.907
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.430
WHAT IS?

13:42.560 --> 13:44.432
THAT'S FOR YOU
TO FIGURE OUT.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.086
FACT THAT MY
INSURANCE WON'T

13:46.216 --> 13:48.871
COVER MORE
THAN 28 DAYS HERE.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.655
THAT'S WHAT'S
NOT ENOUGH!

13:50.786 --> 13:52.092
MAN: THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

13:52.222 --> 13:55.138
NOW YOU'RE JUST
MAKING UP MORE EXCUSES.

13:59.142 --> 14:01.144
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT US.

14:02.493 --> 14:06.541
THIS PLACE...
DOESN'T CARE...

14:06.671 --> 14:08.151
ABOUT ANY OF US!

14:10.675 --> 14:14.114
WOMAN: HE WON'T MAKE IT.
HE'S NOT READY.

14:14.244 --> 14:15.419
HOW CAN YOU
DO THIS TO HIM?

14:15.550 --> 14:17.291
IT WAS A STAFF
DECISION, MOLLY.

14:17.421 --> 14:20.816
WE WERE WORKING HARDER
ON CLAY'S SOBRIETY
THAN HE WAS.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.123
THAT'S NOT RECOVERY.

14:23.253 --> 14:26.126
THAT'S ENABLING.

14:26.256 --> 14:28.171
WHO FEELS LIKE
SHARING NEXT?

14:30.304 --> 14:32.654
WE GOT IT, EMILY.
THANKS.

14:32.784 --> 14:35.483
SO THIS COULD BE
A POSSIBLE SIGNATURE
FOR OUR UNSUB.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.354
IT LOOKS LIKE A WING.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.704
IF THIS IS A SIGNATURE,
THAT MEANS HE DOES IT
TO ALL HIS VICTIMS, RIGHT?

14:39.835 --> 14:41.706
YEAH. WE WOULD HAVE TO
CHECK ALL THE OTHER
VICTIMS,

14:41.837 --> 14:44.535
AND SOME OF THEM
MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN
BURIED OR CREMATED.

14:44.666 --> 14:45.972
IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.364
WHAT ABOUT THE DRUG?
ANY LEADS THERE?

14:47.495 --> 14:49.279
NONE. WHATEVER
THIS GUY'S USING,

14:49.410 --> 14:50.890
IT DOESN'T SHOW UP
ON ANY TOX SCREENS.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.979
HMM...

14:53.109 --> 14:55.677
WHAT?

14:55.807 --> 14:59.768
YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU
MADE ME PEE IN A CUP
SO YOU COULD TEST ME?

14:59.899 --> 15:03.511
YOU MEAN MY PROUDEST
MOMENT AS A WIFE?
YEAH.

15:03.641 --> 15:06.209
WELL, I CHEATED
THE TEST.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.734
ALL RIGHT, DARYL,
I'LL BITE.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.214
HOW'D YOU CHEAT?

15:12.737 --> 15:15.523
CUTTING-EDGE CHEMISTRY.

15:15.653 --> 15:18.178
PRENTISS: GARCIA, DID YOU
FIND THE RESEARCH CHEMICALS
TARA WAS TALKING ABOUT?

15:18.308 --> 15:19.527
GARCIA: DID I!

15:19.657 --> 15:21.094
WHAT ARE
RESEARCH CHEMICALS?

15:21.224 --> 15:22.617
THEY'RE CHEMICAL COUSINS
OF DRUGS,

15:22.747 --> 15:24.749
EASY TO BUY OFF THE 'NET
FROM CHINA, MOSTLY.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.187
THEY'D NORMALLY BE ILLEGAL
UNDER THE CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCES ACT.

15:27.317 --> 15:30.973
GARCIA: ONLY THEY'RE NOT,
THANKS TO SOME VERY
IMAGINATIVE LAB RATS

15:31.104 --> 15:33.671
WHO MODIFIED THE MOLECULES
SO THEY DON'T SHOW UP
ON TOX SCREENS,

15:33.802 --> 15:36.196
HENCE THE TERM
"RESEARCH CHEMICALS."

15:36.326 --> 15:37.719
ALSO, THEY'RE HELLA-POTENT.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.547
AND WHEN THE LAB KNEW
WHAT IT WAS LOOKING FOR,

15:39.677 --> 15:43.246
BONNIE'S TOX SCREEN LIT UP
LIKE A SAD, HIGH CHRISTMAS TREE.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.552
ALVEZ: DOESN'T MAKE
SENSE, THOUGH.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.380
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN OPIATE CRISIS.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.991
WHY GO THROUGH
ALL THAT TROUBLE TO
SYNTHESIZE FAKE ONES?

15:49.122 --> 15:52.255
BECAUSE HE'S A FORENSICALLY
SOPHISTICATED SERIAL KILLER.
THAT'S WHY.

15:52.386 --> 15:56.781
IF YOU'RE AN UNSUB
AND WE CAN'T EVEN IDENTIFY
THE DRUG YOU'RE USING...

15:56.912 --> 15:58.261
YOU STAY IN THE SHADOWS.

15:58.392 --> 16:00.829
PRENTISS: AND OUR BEST LEAD,
BONNIE'S EX-BOYFRIEND VINCENT.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.223
HE'S OUT. HE'S SERVING
7 YEARS FOR A BOTCHED ROBBERY

16:03.353 --> 16:04.789
TO PAY FOR HIS HABIT.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.008
SIMMONS: HE DOESN'T FIT
OUR PROFILE ANYWAY.

16:06.139 --> 16:08.837
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
IS PUNISHING ADDICTS

16:08.968 --> 16:10.752
BECAUSE HE THINKS
THEY'RE GONNA RELAPSE.

16:10.882 --> 16:13.233
HE COULD BE A MORAL
ENFORCER OR FORMER ADDICT

16:13.363 --> 16:15.670
WHO SEES THEM AS WEAK
AND NOT WORTHY TO LIVE.

16:15.800 --> 16:19.456
OR THE OBVIOUS.
KILLING IS HIS ADDICTION.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.763
HE COULD BE IN RECOVERY
LIKE HIS VICTIMS,

16:21.893 --> 16:23.678
ONLY HE'S FOUND A NEW DRUG.

16:23.808 --> 16:26.550
I'M NOT READY.

16:26.681 --> 16:30.250
I TOLD THEM THAT,
AND THEY JUST THREW ME OUT
LIKE I WAS TRASH.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.252
WANT SOME MORE
COFFEE, CLAY?

16:32.382 --> 16:35.820
NO. I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.780
IT'S NOT FAIR,
IS IT?

16:38.910 --> 16:42.914
NO. IT'S NOT.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.613
SO, WHAT DO THEY
WANT FROM ME?

16:45.743 --> 16:48.007
THEY SAY, "IN ORDER
TO BE SOBER,

16:48.137 --> 16:51.140
"YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING
TO STAND ON YOUR HEAD
IF THAT'S WHAT IT...

16:53.012 --> 16:56.276
IF THAT'S WHAT IT...
TAKES."

16:57.755 --> 17:00.758
I WAS...I WAS WILLING.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.848
I WAS WILLING.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.809
NOBODY...

17:07.939 --> 17:09.811
NOBODY BELIEVED.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.816
TO BE FAIR...

17:14.946 --> 17:16.339
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU EITHER.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.053
NO...

17:34.183 --> 17:35.315
N-NO...

17:35.445 --> 17:37.360
MMM...MMM...

17:44.889 --> 17:46.369
SHH...

17:50.721 --> 17:52.375
SHH...SHH...

17:54.899 --> 17:56.379
SHH...

18:12.613 --> 18:14.441
VICTIM'S NAME
IS CLAY MILLER.

18:14.571 --> 18:15.833
AND IF THE UNSUB
FOLLOWED PATTERN,

18:15.964 --> 18:17.444
THIS MIGHT HAVE
SOME DNA ON IT,

18:17.574 --> 18:19.489
SO WE'LL TEST FOR DRUGS
AND M-VAC FOR DNA.

18:19.620 --> 18:20.838
THANK YOU.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.318
WHAT DOES THE VICTIM
TELL US?

18:22.449 --> 18:23.885
HOLD ON A SECOND, GUYS.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.759
DEFINITELY OUR UNSUB.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.848
PERFECT MATCH
TO OUR LAST VICTIM.

18:30.979 --> 18:33.721
BUT THERE'S MORE.
LOOK AT THIS.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.375
PETECHIAL
HEMORRHAGING,

18:35.505 --> 18:38.856
BUT NO LIGATURES
OR SIGNS OF STRANGULATION.

18:38.987 --> 18:40.293
HE WAS SMOTHERED.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.295
THAT'S AN ESCALATION.

18:42.425 --> 18:44.514
SUFFOCATION IS
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

18:44.645 --> 18:47.343
RIGHT, BUT WE FOUND
THE NEEDLE MARK,

18:47.474 --> 18:49.476
SO CLAY WAS GONNA
O.D. ANYWAY.

18:49.606 --> 18:50.651
WHY THE CHANGE?

18:50.781 --> 18:52.740
WAS CLAY JUST DISCHARGED?

18:52.870 --> 18:56.265
YEAH. YESTERDAY FROM...
SWEETWATER SPRINGS REHAB.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.528
LET'S GET J.J. AND
ALVEZ OVER THERE.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.356
MAN: THAT'S EVERYTHING
WE HAVE ON HIM,

19:00.487 --> 19:02.358
HIS INTAKE EVALUATION,
NOTES FROM THE STAFF,

19:02.489 --> 19:03.881
EVERYTHING.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.275
OK, CAN YOU TELL US
WHO HE WAS CLOSE TO
IN HERE?

19:06.406 --> 19:08.321
NO ONE.
HE WAS A LONER.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.583
HE DIDN'T DO THE WORK.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.150
THAT'S WHY WE
KICKED HIM OUT.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.455
ALVEZ:
YOU KICKED HIM OUT?

19:12.586 --> 19:14.762
HE DIDN'T COMPLETE
THE PROGRAM ON HIS OWN?

19:16.024 --> 19:18.635
THAT COULD BE WHAT
ATTRACTS OUR UNSUB
TO HIS VICTIMS.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.463
YEAH, IT COULD BE.

19:20.594 --> 19:23.249
QUICK QUESTION.
CLAY'S INSURANCE
RAN OUT YESTERDAY.

19:23.379 --> 19:24.206
YEAH.

19:25.468 --> 19:29.559
AND THAT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH HIS DISCHARGE?

19:29.690 --> 19:31.387
TERMINAL UNIQUENESS.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.041
THAT'S WHY
WE LET CLAY GO.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.218
IT'S CALLED
TERMINAL UNIQUENESS.

19:36.349 --> 19:40.266
WHAT HAPPENS TO
A JUNKIE WHO THINKS
HE'S EXCEPTIONAL?

19:40.396 --> 19:44.052
HE RELAPSES.
IT'S INEVITABLE.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.401
YOU GUYS FBI?

19:45.532 --> 19:46.924
SSA JAREAU AND ALVEZ.

19:47.055 --> 19:48.361
YOU ARE?

19:48.491 --> 19:51.407
I'M DR. ROB SMITH.
I RUN THIS PLACE.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.931
PHIL HERE TOLD ME
YOU'VE BEEN ASKING
SOME QUESTIONS.

19:54.062 --> 19:57.196
HE'S ALSO NOT AT LIBERTY
TO GIVE YOU CLAY'S FILE

19:57.326 --> 19:59.763
WITHOUT PERMISSION
FROM ME OR A
WARRANT FROM YOU.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.156
PRIVACY ISSUES.
YOU UNDERSTAND.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.941
DOCTOR-PATIENT PRIVILEGE
DOESN'T APPLY POSTMORTEM.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.943
I'M TALKING ABOUT
MY PRIVACY AS A
SMALL BUSINESS OWNER

20:06.074 --> 20:07.423
WITH 12 CENTERS
AROUND THE CITY.

20:07.554 --> 20:10.426
JAREAU: OK, WELL, WE'RE
TRYING TO FIND A PATTERN

20:10.557 --> 20:15.301
FOR A KILLER WHO IS
OVERDOSING PATIENTS THE DAY
AFTER THEY FINISH TREATMENT,

20:15.431 --> 20:18.956
AND NOW YOUR 12 CENTERS
MIGHT BE OUR NEXUS.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.958
I HIGHLY DOUBT IT
BECAUSE YOU HAVE

20:21.089 --> 20:23.222
A FUNDAMENTAL
MISUNDERSTANDING

20:23.352 --> 20:24.788
OF WHAT YOU'RE
INVESTIGATING.

20:24.919 --> 20:29.184
YOU'RE FOCUSING ON
THE OVERDOSE.
THAT'S A SYMPTOM.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.142
BUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH
EVERY DECISION

20:31.273 --> 20:35.451
TO PICK UP THE MARTINI
SHAKER, CHOP OUT
A LINE, TIE OFF AN ARM--

20:35.582 --> 20:36.974
SELFISHNESS.

20:37.105 --> 20:38.454
ADDICTS ARE SELFISH,

20:38.585 --> 20:40.630
AND THOUGH I DON'T
HATE MY PATIENTS,

20:40.761 --> 20:42.458
I DO HATE THEIR
SELFISHNESS.

20:42.589 --> 20:45.461
AND IF THEY DON'T LIKE
THAT, THEY CAN GO OFF
TO THEIR ALLEY AND DIE.

20:45.592 --> 20:49.465
BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE
HERE WHO WANT WHAT WE HAVE,

20:49.596 --> 20:54.514
UNLIKE OUR DEAR DEPARTED
TERMINALLY UNIQUE CLAY.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.560
SO...

20:57.691 --> 20:59.519
I THINK WE'RE
DONE HERE, AGENTS.

21:02.043 --> 21:04.480
ALVEZ: I THINK IT'S TIME
TO TURN GARCIA'S SPOTLIGHT
ON DR. SMITH.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.917
WHAT DO YOU THINK?OH, HELL, YEAH.

21:09.050 --> 21:12.053
HEY, UH, GIVE ME A SEC.

21:13.533 --> 21:17.754
HEY, I'M J.J.
WITH THE FBI.

21:17.885 --> 21:21.105
I KNOW. I'M MOLLY.

21:21.236 --> 21:24.108
I'M SORRY ABOUT CLAY.

21:24.239 --> 21:26.502
ME TOO.

21:26.633 --> 21:30.027
UH, YOU THINK YOU COULD
HELP US OUT, MOLLY?

21:30.158 --> 21:34.249
MAYBE COME DOWN TO
THE OFFICE,
ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS?

21:34.380 --> 21:38.079
I'M ON LOCKDOWN.
I'M NOT ALLOWED
OFF THE PREMISES.

21:40.081 --> 21:42.257
BUT TAKE THIS.

21:42.388 --> 21:43.693
IT'S A JOURNAL.

21:43.824 --> 21:46.000
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,

21:46.130 --> 21:49.177
BUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
CLAY, THE REAL CLAY,

21:49.308 --> 21:50.700
READ THAT.

21:50.831 --> 21:52.572
THANK YOU.

21:55.096 --> 21:57.141
WE NEED TO GO SEE TARA.

21:59.405 --> 22:02.582
WRIGHT: I--I DON'T KNOW
WHEN I'LL BE HOME.

22:05.106 --> 22:07.456
MIGHT BE LATE.

22:07.587 --> 22:12.069
HEY, UH, I'M SORRY
I WAS LATE.

22:12.200 --> 22:16.552
WELL, YOU'RE WORTH
WAITING UP FOR.

22:16.683 --> 22:22.384
ESPECIALLY TONIGHT
BECAUSE WE HAVE
SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE.

22:22.515 --> 22:23.907
SHUT UP.

22:24.038 --> 22:26.083
SHUT UP!

22:26.214 --> 22:32.612
SAY HELLO TO THE
SOON-TO-BE DR. DARYL WRIGHT.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.100
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.152
LOVE YOU, TOO.

22:54.634 --> 22:56.592
HOW'S YOUR WIFE?

22:56.723 --> 22:58.551
OOH, CHECK OUT
THE PROFILER.

23:00.030 --> 23:01.858
WHAT

23:01.989 --> 23:05.035
WELL, WITH SOMETHING
AS PERSONAL AS A
SIGNATURE LIKE THIS,

23:05.166 --> 23:07.342
I LIKE TO TRACE IT WITH
MY NONDOMINANT HAND,

23:07.473 --> 23:10.301
AND IT HELPS ME SEE
THINGS THAT MY RATIONAL
MIND MIGHT MISS.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.565
SO, YOU...SEE ANYTHING?

23:12.695 --> 23:14.567
WELL, IT'S NOT A STAMP.

23:14.697 --> 23:16.438
IT WAS HAND-DRAWN
IN UV INK.

23:16.569 --> 23:17.396
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
REMINDS ME OF?

23:18.962 --> 23:21.138
THOSE UV STAMPS
WE USED TO GET AT THAT
CLUB NEAR DARTMOUTH

23:21.269 --> 23:22.444
WHEN WE WERE GRAD STUDENTS.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.620
OH, MY GOD!

23:24.751 --> 23:27.057
YEAH, WE WOULDN'T WASH
THE BACK OF OUR HANDS

23:27.188 --> 23:30.626
SO WE COULD GO BACK FREE
THE NEXT TIME. HA HA!

23:30.757 --> 23:32.976
AND I SAVED YOUR ASS
THERE ONE NIGHT.

23:33.107 --> 23:34.456
YOU WERE SO TRASHED.

23:34.587 --> 23:35.762
NO, NO. I WAS
NOT TRASHED.

23:35.892 --> 23:38.155
I WAS BUZZED,
AND THERE'S A
DISTINCT DIFFERENCE.

23:38.286 --> 23:39.940
I HAD TO DRAG YOU
OUT OF THERE.

23:40.070 --> 23:43.726
YOU WERE SCREAMING,
"WHICH ONE OF YOU SORORITY
BITCHES WANTS TO FIGHT?"

23:43.857 --> 23:46.599
HA! UH...

23:46.729 --> 23:47.817
AAH!

23:47.948 --> 23:49.471
LISTEN TO ME,
YOU STUPID BITCH.

23:49.602 --> 23:51.647
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF ME RIGHT NOW!

23:51.778 --> 23:52.866
AAH!

23:56.739 --> 23:59.481
YEAH. THAT STORY'S
NOT FUNNY ANYMORE.

23:59.612 --> 24:01.352
WHY NOT?

24:02.745 --> 24:04.312
THAT NIGHT WAS INCREDIBLE.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.880
YEAH, BUT THEN THE
NEXT WEEK, YOU...

24:09.230 --> 24:11.188
I WHAT?

24:11.319 --> 24:14.627
YOU DON'T REMEMBER.

24:14.757 --> 24:17.673
THE WORST MOMENT
OF OUR MARRIAGE,

24:17.804 --> 24:20.023
THE WORST MOMENT
OF MY LIFE.

24:20.154 --> 24:21.677
THE MOMENT I KNEW
WE WERE OVER,

24:21.808 --> 24:24.114
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN BE
BOTHERED TO REMEMBER.

24:24.245 --> 24:27.204
TARA, THERE WAS A LOT
OF STUFF I DID BACK THEN
THAT I JUST CAN'T--

24:27.335 --> 24:28.684
STOP IT.
STOP IT.

24:28.815 --> 24:29.772
NO.
PLEASE.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.731
I NEED TO SAY--SHUT UP.

24:38.738 --> 24:40.261
I...

24:45.048 --> 24:47.747
I NEED A SECOND.

24:47.877 --> 24:50.227
I NEED TO CALL MY SPONSOR.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.273
YEAH.
YOU SHOULD DO THAT.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.719
ALVEZ: WHAT DID YOU FIND
OUT ABOUT DR. ROBERT SMITH?

25:03.850 --> 25:05.547
GARCIA: FIRST OF ALL,
HE'S NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR.

25:05.678 --> 25:07.854
HE HAS HIS DOCTORATE
IN BUSINESS

25:07.984 --> 25:10.421
FROM A NON-ACCREDITED
ONLINE UNIVERSITY.

25:10.552 --> 25:13.512
SO, HE'S ACTUALLY
MORE LIKE EX-CON ROB SMITH,

25:13.642 --> 25:15.992
'CAUSE I'M SENDING YOU
HIS CRIMINAL RECORD NOW.

25:16.123 --> 25:18.473
WELL, THEY'RE MOSTLY
DRUG AND ASSAULT CHARGES,

25:18.604 --> 25:20.910
BUT HE DID SOME TIME
FOR MANSLAUGHTER.

25:21.041 --> 25:23.260
"BEAT A GUY TO DEATH
FOR CALLING HIM A FAILURE."

25:23.391 --> 25:25.219
GARCIA: CALLING HIM A SLUMLORD
WOULD ALSO WORK,

25:25.349 --> 25:29.658
BECAUSE AS I WAS HACKING
AND SLASHING THROUGH THE
FINANCIAL MACHINATIONS

25:29.789 --> 25:32.226
OF THE SORT-OF-TERRIBLE,
NOT-GOOD-AT-ALL DOCTOR,

25:32.356 --> 25:36.099
I DISCOVERED THAT 7 OF
OUR 9 VICTIMS WENT TO
HIS TREATMENT CENTERS.

25:36.230 --> 25:37.710
ALVEZ: SO WE'RE DEALING
WITH SOMEONE

25:37.840 --> 25:40.626
THAT HAS A HISTORY OF
VIOLENCE AND DRUG ABUSE.

25:40.756 --> 25:43.498
HE ALSO HATES ADDICTS
WHO DON'T WORK AS HARD
AS HE DOES.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.892
THEY MAKE HIM
FEEL LIKE A FAILURE,
JUST LIKE THE GUY HE KILLED.

25:46.022 --> 25:47.589
PRENTISS: HE'S LOOKING MORE
AND MORE LIKE OUR UNSUB.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.330
BRING HIM IN FOR QUESTIONING.

25:54.335 --> 25:55.597
WHERE IS IT?

25:55.728 --> 25:57.164
PHIL, WHERE IS IT?

25:57.294 --> 25:58.774
WE'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.516
WE FOUND EVERYONE'S
JOURNAL EXCEPT CLAY'S.

26:04.867 --> 26:07.783
BRING HER IN
AND CLOSE THE DOOR.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.395
MOLLY.

26:19.055 --> 26:20.883
HAVE A SEAT.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.073
WHAT DID YOU DO, MOLLY?

26:37.204 --> 26:39.206
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE T--

26:39.336 --> 26:41.730
DON'T--DON'T LIE TO ME.

26:43.427 --> 26:44.864
CLAY'S JOURNAL.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.388
DID YOU GIVE IT
TO THE FBI?

26:47.518 --> 26:50.391
TELL ME THE TRUTH,
AND I CAN STILL HELP YOU!

26:51.784 --> 26:55.135
ROB SMITH, WE NEED YOU
TO COME WITH US.

26:55.265 --> 26:57.920
OK. LET ME
GET MY COAT.

27:02.316 --> 27:03.578
I'M ON HIM!

27:03.709 --> 27:04.840
YOU OK?

27:09.497 --> 27:10.933
OOF!

27:17.287 --> 27:18.941
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

27:23.903 --> 27:26.688
FOR A MAN WHO'S ALL
ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY,

27:26.819 --> 27:29.517
YOU DON'T SHOW MUCH.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.867
YOU GUYS DON'T GET IT.WELL, WHAT WE HAVE

27:31.998 --> 27:33.782
ARE 7 VICTIMS
FROM YOUR REHABS.

27:33.913 --> 27:35.349
ALVEZ: AND YOU
DESTROYING EVIDENCE.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.656
AND YOU RUNNING FROM US,
SO WHAT DON'T WE GET, ROB?

27:37.786 --> 27:41.964
WHY WOULD I BE
KILLING MY CUSTOMERS...

27:42.095 --> 27:46.055
WHEN I COULD BE MAKING
MONEY OFF THEM INSTEAD?

27:46.186 --> 27:47.666
SIMMONS:
ROB SMITH IS A CON MAN

27:47.796 --> 27:49.842
AND HE DOESN'T GIVE
A CRAP ABOUT HIS PATIENTS,

27:49.972 --> 27:51.452
BUT HE IS NOT OUR UNSUB.

27:51.582 --> 27:55.021
HIS WHOLE BUSINESS
MODEL COUNTS ON HIS
PATIENTS RELAPSING.

27:55.151 --> 27:58.851
HE DOESN'T OFFER
ANY SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL
OR THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT.

27:58.981 --> 28:02.855
HE WANTS THEM TO REHAB
AND RELAPSE SO HE CAN CHARGE
THEIR INSURANCE REPEATEDLY.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.813
ALVEZ:
HE WAS WORRIED THAT
CLAY AND THE OTHERS

28:04.944 --> 28:06.423
WERE WRITING ABOUT IT
IN THEIR JOURNALS.

28:06.554 --> 28:08.208
THAT'S WHY HE WANTED
TO HIDE THEM FROM US.

28:08.338 --> 28:10.384
WELL, THAT TAKES
MOTIVE OFF THE TABLE.

28:10.514 --> 28:12.865
PRENTISS: DID WE GET
THE OTHER VICTIMS'
JOURNALS WITH A WARRANT?

28:12.995 --> 28:14.344
YEAH, WE DID.

28:14.475 --> 28:15.650
PRENTISS: WE NEED TO GO
THROUGH THEM PAGE BY PAGE.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.392
I THINK THERE'S A
VICTIMOLOGY CONNECTION
THAT WE'RE MISSING.

28:18.522 --> 28:19.915
TARA'S
ALREADY STARTED.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.441
YOU ARE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THIS.

28:24.572 --> 28:26.922
I THINK CLAY WROTE
ABOUT THE UNSUB IN
HIS JOURNAL, AND--

28:28.881 --> 28:31.100
HI.
HI.

28:33.276 --> 28:34.408
I'M MARY. I'M, UH--

28:34.538 --> 28:37.759
HIS WIFE.
I KNOW.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.630
WHERE'S DARYL?

28:39.761 --> 28:41.415
HE'S UH...

28:41.545 --> 28:44.418
HE'S A LITTLE UPSET...

28:44.548 --> 28:49.249
AT WHAT HE COULDN'T REMEMBER
ABOUT WHAT HE DID TO YOU.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.906
CAN--UM,
CAN WE SIT?

28:54.036 --> 28:56.473
YEAH. OF COURSE.

29:02.131 --> 29:04.090
DO YOU KNOW THE 9th
OF THE 12 STEPS?

29:04.220 --> 29:05.656
I--I DO.

29:05.787 --> 29:10.009
UM...WE MADE AMENDS
TO THOSE WE HARMED.

29:10.139 --> 29:12.925
UNLESS DOING SO WOULD
INJURE THEM OR OTHERS.

29:13.055 --> 29:15.797
DARYL WANTED
TO REACH OUT TO YOU
TO MAKE AMENDS,

29:15.928 --> 29:19.714
BUT HIS SPONSOR SAID,
"LEAVE YOUR EX-WIFE ALONE.
LET HER LIVE HER LIFE.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.934
MAKE YOUR AMENDS BY
DOING BETTER NEXT TIME."

29:22.064 --> 29:24.371
IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS.

29:26.373 --> 29:29.680
BUT...IT BOTHERED HIM,

29:29.811 --> 29:33.467
NOT SAYING A SIMPLE
"I'M SORRY"

29:33.597 --> 29:38.167
UNTIL HE STUMBLED UPON
PEOPLE WHO WERE BEING
MURDERED THAT...THAT...

29:38.298 --> 29:41.475
THAT THIS
WAS HOW HE COULD
MAKE HIS AMENDS?

29:41.605 --> 29:43.564
ONLY NOW HE FEELS
LIKE HE'S MADE IT WORSE.

29:46.001 --> 29:50.484
IF YOU COULD JUST TELL ME
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ALL THIS,

29:50.614 --> 29:53.182
WE COULD HELP HIM
GET PAST IT.

29:54.705 --> 29:59.493
I JUST--I SEE WHAT
HE HAS NOW,

29:59.623 --> 30:00.973
WHAT YOU HAVE
WITH HIM, AND--

30:01.103 --> 30:03.279
AND YOU'RE JEALOUS.NO.

30:05.020 --> 30:07.196
NO. I'M CONFUSED.

30:08.676 --> 30:13.507
I KILLED MYSELF
TO HELP HIM GET CLEAN.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.814
WHY COULDN'T HE GET
SOBER WITH ME?

30:15.944 --> 30:17.554
I DON'T KNOW.

30:20.383 --> 30:24.518
BUT IF IT HELPS,
I LIVE SCARED EVERY DAY.

30:24.648 --> 30:25.998
THAT HE'LL RELAPSE?

30:26.128 --> 30:29.305
NO. THAT HE'LL
LEAVE ME FOR...

30:31.786 --> 30:34.049
THE WAY HE TALKS
ABOUT YOU.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.055
HE STILL LOVES YOU.

30:42.231 --> 30:44.059
I DON'T WANT THAT.

30:45.452 --> 30:47.236
I'M HAPPY FOR HIM.

30:49.064 --> 30:52.720
I'M REALLY HAPPY
FOR YOU BOTH,

30:52.851 --> 30:57.551
BUT I DO NEED HIM.
GIVE THAT TO HIM.

30:57.681 --> 31:01.642
IT'LL TELL HIM THAT
HE WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG

31:01.772 --> 31:05.602
AND THAT I NEED
HIS HELP TO STOP
THIS KILLER.

31:07.604 --> 31:08.692
OK.

31:12.783 --> 31:14.960
PRENTISS: WE HAVE 12 INSTANCES
ON OUR END, GARCIA.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.439
HOW MANY DID YOU FIND?

31:16.570 --> 31:19.399
GARCIA: 15 SO FAR. REFERENCES
OF BROKEN WINGS, ANGELS,

31:19.529 --> 31:20.748
AND THE LIKE
ACROSS ALL JOURNALS.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.751
3 OF THE VICTIMS SAY
IT'S A METAPHOR FOR ADDICTION

31:23.882 --> 31:25.405
SUGGESTED BY
ONE OF THE STAFF.

31:25.535 --> 31:27.581
THAT STAFF MEMBER
COULD BE OUR UNSUB.

31:27.711 --> 31:30.714
BUT, GARCIA,
WE RULED OUT THE REHAB
STAFF, DIDN'T WE?

31:30.845 --> 31:32.325
YEAH. EVERYBODY
ON THE BOOKS, ANYWAY.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.718
THE UNSUB'S USE
OF MODIFIED OPIATES

31:34.849 --> 31:36.895
MAY MEAN HE'S
MEDICALLY SOPHISTICATED.

31:37.025 --> 31:41.508
IT COULD BE SOMEONE
ON THE NURSING STAFF
THAT SMITH PAYS INDIRECTLY.

31:41.638 --> 31:43.423
NOW THE QUESTION IS,
WILL SMITH HELP US?

31:43.553 --> 31:47.470
MATT, LUKE, SEE IF YOU
CAN GET THE TEMPORARY PAYROLL
INFORMATION FROM SMITH.

31:47.601 --> 31:50.604
GARCIA, START DIGGING INTO
TEMP AND TRAVELING NURSES
JUST IN CASE.

31:50.734 --> 31:52.084
AFFIRMATIVE.

31:52.214 --> 31:53.607
MAN: NICE TRY, AGENTS,

31:53.737 --> 31:55.261
BUT DR. SMITH'S
COOPERATION

31:55.391 --> 31:57.045
ONLY EXTENDS TO YOUR
MURDER INVESTIGATION.

31:57.176 --> 31:59.178
HOW HE PAYS HIS EMPLOYEES
IS OFF-LIMITS.

31:59.308 --> 32:02.703
IT'S THE SAME INVESTIGATION.
HE'S HIDING A KILLER.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.748
WE'RE DONE.

32:04.879 --> 32:06.011
HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S
GONNA AFFECT YOUR BRAND

32:07.577 --> 32:09.101
WHEN WE REVEAL
THAT YOU EMPLOYED SOMEONE
WHO THOUGHT IT WAS

32:09.231 --> 32:11.233
OK TO MURDER THE VERY
PEOPLE YOU SAY YOU'RE
TRYING TO HELP?

32:11.364 --> 32:12.626
SMITH: YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

32:12.756 --> 32:15.107
I THINK I'M GOING TO
CALL A MEETING.

32:15.237 --> 32:18.284
HAVE A SIT-DOWN
WITH MOLLY, TAKE
HER INVENTORY.

32:18.414 --> 32:19.198
THAT'S A THREAT.

32:20.416 --> 32:21.635
SMITH: HOPE YOU CATCH
THIS GUY. I REALLY DO.

32:21.765 --> 32:23.942
SO TAKE IT EASY,
FELLAS.

32:24.072 --> 32:27.119
AND WHEN YOU NEED
TO GET OFF STEROIDS,
COME SEE ME.

32:32.863 --> 32:35.997
GEEZ...THEY ALL WROTE
ABOUT THEIR KILLER.

32:36.128 --> 32:39.653
YEAH, AND NOW WE HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF
WHO THIS GUY IS,

32:39.783 --> 32:41.481
FROM A PROFILING
PERSPECTIVE ANYWAY.

32:41.611 --> 32:43.004
HE'S AN ANGEL OF MERCY.

32:43.135 --> 32:45.659
LIKE A DOCTOR OR NURSE
WHO KILLS THEIR PATIENTS?

32:45.789 --> 32:49.271
EXACTLY. ELIZABETH
WETTLAUFER BELIEVED
GOD WANTED HER TO KILL.

32:49.402 --> 32:52.013
DONALD HARVEY KILLED
HIS PATIENTS TO
EASE THEIR PAIN.

32:52.144 --> 32:54.146
ANGELS OF MERCY HAVE
THE HIGHEST BODY COUNTS

32:54.276 --> 32:56.322
BECAUSE THEY HUNT IN
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE
TYPICALLY DIE.

32:56.452 --> 32:58.759
YEAH.

32:58.889 --> 33:02.676
FOR THIS GUY,
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE BROKEN WING.

33:02.806 --> 33:04.765
HE GETS THEM TO
SEE THEMSELVES THIS WAY,

33:04.895 --> 33:07.550
AND IF THEY BUY IN
AND HE BELIEVES
THEY'RE TRULY BROKEN,

33:07.681 --> 33:10.162
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA
GET BETTER,

33:10.292 --> 33:11.685
I HAVE TO KILL THEM
TO END THEIR SUFFERING.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.167
FREEZE.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.691
WHAT?

33:17.821 --> 33:19.171
YOU STILL HAVE YOURS.

33:19.301 --> 33:20.563
HAVE WHAT?

33:25.742 --> 33:28.180
Y-YEAH. I, UM...

33:28.310 --> 33:29.746
YEAH.

33:34.229 --> 33:36.797
I KEEP MINE
BECAUSE IT'S A...

33:36.927 --> 33:39.539
REMINDER OF THE
WRECKAGE OF MY PAST.

33:39.669 --> 33:40.931
TARA, I...

33:41.062 --> 33:43.195
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE HE DOES, TOO.

33:43.325 --> 33:45.023
I THINK THAT'S WHAT
WE'VE BEEN MISSING HERE.

33:45.153 --> 33:46.894
I DON'T GET IT.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.244
WELL, LOOK, THIS GUY,
HE INKS HIS VICTIMS.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.767
THEY'RE HIS SIGNATURES,
HIS TROPHIES,

33:50.898 --> 33:53.553
BUT HE WOULDN'T
STOP THERE.

33:53.683 --> 33:55.250
YOU--YOU THINK HE'D
SIGN HIMSELF, TOO?

33:55.381 --> 33:56.556
LOOK AT THE DESIGN.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.210
IT'S ONE-HALF OF A
BROKEN WING. RIGHT?

33:58.340 --> 34:00.864
I'M THINKING HE PUTS
THE OTHER HALF
ON HIS BODY.

34:00.995 --> 34:03.215
AND THAT WAY, THE
WINGS ARE WHOLE AFTER
HIS VICTIMS DIE.

34:03.345 --> 34:04.738
THEY'RE COMPLETE.

34:16.271 --> 34:19.231
I THINK THIS IS
THE BEST ONE YET.

34:19.361 --> 34:20.797
CHECK IT OUT.

34:32.287 --> 34:34.246
MAN: GOOD.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.770
CLAY--HE WAS...

34:36.900 --> 34:38.293
SPECIAL.

34:42.471 --> 34:45.953
MY INSURANCE ISN'T UP.
I STILL HAVE ANOTHER
2 WEEKS.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.260
MOLLY, MOLLY, MOLLY.

34:48.390 --> 34:50.088
WHAT DID YOU THINK
WAS GONNA HAPPEN?

34:50.218 --> 34:52.568
YOU PUT YOUR NEEDS
AHEAD OF THE GROUP.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.309
WE CAN'T TOLERATE THAT.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.137
ROB, I DON'T THINK--

34:56.268 --> 34:58.096
OH, I--I THINK SO.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.622
NO.

35:02.752 --> 35:05.277
PHIL. PHIL, YOU KNOW
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

35:05.407 --> 35:06.843
MOLLY: PHIL!

35:08.845 --> 35:10.238
IT'S UNFORTUNATE.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.286
HOW CAN THEY DO THIS?

35:14.416 --> 35:17.158
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

35:17.289 --> 35:19.726
I'M GONNA END UP
LIKE CLAY. I KNOW IT.

35:21.206 --> 35:24.339
IF YOU'RE THAT
WORRIED ABOUT IT,
I CAN GIVE YOU A RIDE,

35:24.470 --> 35:25.862
IF THAT'LL HELP.

35:27.212 --> 35:30.302
YEAH. YEAH.

35:30.432 --> 35:31.520
I MEAN, ARE YOU SURE?

35:31.651 --> 35:33.827
YEAH, I'M SURE.

35:33.957 --> 35:36.221
I DO THIS JOB SO
I CAN HELP PEOPLE.

35:37.787 --> 35:39.180
THANK YOU.

35:39.311 --> 35:40.877
LET ME GET THAT.

36:04.597 --> 36:06.251
GARCIA, WE GOT YOUR LIST
OF FREELANCE NURSING STAFF,

36:06.381 --> 36:08.905
BUT DID YOU CROSS-REFERENCE
CREDIT CARD RECORDS

36:09.036 --> 36:10.516
WITH LOCAL TATTOO PARLORS?

36:10.646 --> 36:11.560
YEAH, I'M DOING THAT NOW.

36:12.909 --> 36:14.433
IT LOOKS LIKE THE FREELANCERS
WERE PAID VIA SOME

36:14.563 --> 36:16.478
NATIONAL TRAVELING
NURSES ASSOCIATION.

36:16.609 --> 36:18.219
ROSSI: FOCUS ON
TEMPORARY HIRES

36:18.350 --> 36:21.657
THAT FALL IN LINE
WITH THE REHABS SMITH
VISITS DAY BY DAY.

36:21.788 --> 36:23.833
LOOK FOR OVERLAP
BETWEEN THE TWO.

36:23.964 --> 36:28.925
GARCIA: OK. I CAN SEE
THE MATRIX, PEOPLE.

36:29.056 --> 36:30.275
AH! THERE IT IS!

36:30.405 --> 36:32.886
UH, NURSE OF THE MALE
VARIETY--DOUGLAS KNIGHT.

36:33.016 --> 36:34.583
8 SESSIONS AT LOCAL
TATTOO PARLORS,

36:34.714 --> 36:35.932
ALL WITHIN HOURS
OF EACH DEATH.

36:36.063 --> 36:37.282
HERE'S HIS WORK
AND HOME ADDRESS.

36:37.412 --> 36:40.154
GREAT WORK. COPY TARA
ON WHAT YOU FOUND.

36:40.285 --> 36:43.766
WRIGHT: THIS GUY LOST
HIS WIFE DAPHNE
5 YEARS AGO TO AN OVERDOSE.

36:43.897 --> 36:45.551
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL
A STRESSOR.

36:45.681 --> 36:46.943
SO WHY DIDN'T HE START
KILLING 5 YEARS AGO?

36:47.074 --> 36:48.902
WELL, BECAUSE
THE TRIGGER CAME LATER.

36:49.032 --> 36:52.384
DOES IT SAY WHEN HE
STARTED WORKING AT ROB
SMITH'S REHAB HOUSES?

36:52.514 --> 36:54.168
YEAH, A COUPLE YEARS LATER.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.301
OK, IN AL-ANON, SINCE
I COULDN'T HELP YOU,

36:56.431 --> 36:58.607
I WAS TOLD TO LOOK
FOR THE NEXT PERSON
THAT I COULD HELP.

36:58.738 --> 37:00.130
MAYBE DOUGLAS KNIGHT
DID THE SAME.

37:00.261 --> 37:01.828
AND HE BECAME
A REHAB NURSE,

37:01.958 --> 37:03.525
AND HE WAS SURROUNDED
BY PATIENTS LIKE HIS WIFE.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.962
RIGHT. RIGHT. SO HE
HELPED AND HELPED
UNTIL HE BROKE.

37:06.093 --> 37:07.225
THAT WAS HIS TRIGGER.

37:08.791 --> 37:09.531
NOW HE THINKS HE'S
PUTTING THESE PEOPLE
OUT OF THEIR MISERY.

37:09.662 --> 37:10.837
SO WE JUST SIT HERE
AND WAIT?

37:10.967 --> 37:13.013
NO. I HAVE
A BETTER IDEA.

37:15.407 --> 37:17.322
EMILY, DID YOU
FIND HIM YET?

37:26.766 --> 37:29.029
NO, NO, NO, NO!

37:31.684 --> 37:33.468
AAH...

37:33.599 --> 37:35.470
THIS IS WHAT'S BEST.

37:35.601 --> 37:37.037
YOU'LL SEE.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.519
I'M DOING THIS
OUT OF LOVE.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.652
HEY, WHERE IS
DOUGLAS KNIGHT?

37:43.783 --> 37:46.002
IS THE FBI LOOKING
TO GET SUED OR WHAT?

37:46.133 --> 37:48.570
DOUGLAS WORKS FOR YOU.
WE NEED TO FIND HIM RIGHT NOW.

37:48.701 --> 37:50.006
PHIL:
HE ESCORTED MOLLY WITT
OUT OF THE BUILDING.

37:50.137 --> 37:51.486
PHIL, SHUT UP!
NO!

37:51.617 --> 37:53.227
THIS IS OVER.

37:53.358 --> 37:55.708
YOU WON'T HAVE TO
FEEL ANY MORE PAIN.

37:55.838 --> 37:58.537
YOU WON'T HAVE TO
HURT ANYMORE,

37:58.667 --> 38:01.757
YOU WON'T HURT
ANYONE ELSE.
PLEASE, NO!

38:01.888 --> 38:03.977
BUT I WILL ALWAYS
REMEMBER YOU.

38:06.501 --> 38:09.591
DOUGLAS KNIGHT? FBI!

38:09.722 --> 38:11.506
KNIGHT:
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE!

38:11.637 --> 38:16.032
PRENTISS:
DOUGLAS, JUST WAIT...

38:16.163 --> 38:17.512
AND LISTEN.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.517
LEWIS: DOUGLAS, I KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LOSE
SOMEONE TO THIS DISEASE.

38:22.648 --> 38:25.172
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO LOSE SOMEONE
TO THIS DISEASE.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.218
ALL YOUR HOPES AND YOUR
DREAMS FOR THE FUTURE

38:28.349 --> 38:30.960
DESTROYED IN THE FACE
OF SOMETHING THAT
YOU CAN'T PREDICT.

38:31.091 --> 38:33.049
...AND YOU CAN'T CONTROL.

38:33.180 --> 38:35.095
SOMETIMES, I WANTED TO SHAKE
THE MAN I LOVED.

38:35.225 --> 38:36.923
I'D EVEN GET INTO
FISTFIGHTS WITH HIM...

38:37.053 --> 38:41.667
BECAUSE I WANTED HIM TO SEE
HOW MUCH HE'D HURT ME,

38:41.797 --> 38:45.758
UNTIL IT GOT SO BAD THAT
I HAD TO LET HIM GO.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.934
EVEN THOUGH THAT MEANT
POSSIBLY...

38:48.064 --> 38:49.805
PROBABLY LETTING HIM DIE.

38:52.808 --> 38:55.158
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
FEELS LIKE, DON'T YOU?

38:57.422 --> 38:58.553
YES.

38:58.684 --> 39:00.163
YES, I DO.

39:00.294 --> 39:03.558
DOUGLAS,
THIS DISEASE...

39:03.689 --> 39:04.994
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

39:05.125 --> 39:08.737
...IMPOSSIBLE TO CURE,
IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT,

39:08.868 --> 39:11.827
BUT SO MANY PEOPLE
EVENTUALLY MAKE IT.

39:11.958 --> 39:15.135
ALL I CAN SAY IS,
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE.

39:17.093 --> 39:18.921
AND MOLLY DESERVES
THAT CHANCE.

39:19.052 --> 39:21.141
...BECAUSE HER DISEASE
ISN'T KILLING HER.

39:21.271 --> 39:22.751
YOU ARE.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.884
YOU NEED TO LET HER GO.

39:31.107 --> 39:32.457
LET HER GO.

39:46.732 --> 39:50.083
MOLLY! I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A SHOT OF NALOXONE.

39:50.213 --> 39:53.173
IT'S GONNA SAVE YOUR LIFE,
BUT IT WON'T FEEL GOOD.

40:00.006 --> 40:03.531
OK, THERE YOU ARE. OK.

40:03.662 --> 40:05.141
ALL RIGHT. WE GOT YOU.
