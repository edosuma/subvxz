00:51.819 --> 00:53.352
Travis.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.286
Travis!

00:54.288 --> 00:55.254
What?

01:04.831 --> 01:08.067
--You just
ruined my game, Whitney.

01:08.069 --> 01:10.502
Travis, mom's looking for you.

01:10.504 --> 01:13.505
I'll be right there, mom.

01:13.507 --> 01:14.473
Are you even packed?

01:14.475 --> 01:15.874
Are you even human?

01:15.876 --> 01:18.510
What other species could I be?

01:18.512 --> 01:20.312
Travis, what are you doing?

01:20.314 --> 01:21.246
Where's your bag?

01:21.248 --> 01:23.215
Grandpa's ready to go.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.616
Hello there, kids.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.251
Ugh.

01:29.722 --> 01:30.889
Ugh.

01:33.094 --> 01:34.526
Hello?

01:34.528 --> 01:35.194
Yeah, one sec.

01:35.196 --> 01:35.194
Hold on.

01:35.196 --> 01:39.598
Mom, do I have time to
run over to Rick's house?

01:39.600 --> 01:40.365
No.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.500
It's time to go.

01:41.502 --> 01:42.301
Here's your bag.

01:42.303 --> 01:42.301
No, I can't.

01:42.303 --> 01:46.138
Me and Whitney are leaving
for my grandparents' farm.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.540
Yeah believe me, i
do not want to go.

01:48.542 --> 01:53.445
My parents want us to
rediscover nature, or whatever.

01:54.381 --> 01:56.181
Hey!

01:56.183 --> 01:56.181
Bye Rick.

01:56.183 --> 01:58.617
He'll see you in a few weeks.

01:58.619 --> 02:03.122
Travis, remember our agreement--
no cell phones, no video games.

02:03.124 --> 02:06.024
Oh, so in other words, no fun.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.993
I won't survive more than a day.

02:07.995 --> 02:08.961
You know that, right?

02:08.963 --> 02:10.662
Why wouldn't you survive?

02:10.663 --> 02:14.600
You'll have food, water, and
shelter, all the essentials

02:14.602 --> 02:15.534
for survival.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.935
Mom.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.637
Whitney honey, why don't
you take your things down

02:18.639 --> 02:21.573
to the truck?

02:21.575 --> 02:23.142
I don't want to go this year.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.544
Why can't Whitney
just go by herself?

02:25.546 --> 02:26.845
Because I said so.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.515
Let's go.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.917
I'm not going.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.920
I think I'm big enough
to make my own decisions.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.222
Hee.

02:37.224 --> 02:39.324
It's only for a
few weeks, Travis.

02:39.326 --> 02:39.324
You'll live.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.294
Come here, give me a hug.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.903
Okey-dokey, kids,
you ready to roll?

02:50.905 --> 02:53.338
Pop, you drive carefully, ok?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.640
It's not a race.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.341
Eh, keep up a good pace?

02:56.343 --> 02:58.343
Well, I'll do my best.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.614
And we're off.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.492
Don't forget to take a
bath and brush your teeth.

03:14.160 --> 03:14.159
Blah, blah

03:14.161 --> 03:16.595
and be nice to your sister.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.808
Bye.

03:29.810 --> 03:30.809
Have fun.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.444
Be good.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.934
There's one from north Dakota.

04:28.936 --> 04:32.738
Now I only need Indiana,
Kansas, Missouri, and Ohio

04:32.740 --> 04:35.374
and I'll have the
complete midwest.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.776
And how many states
do you have, Travis?

04:40.948 --> 04:43.782
You are such a grump.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.750
Grumpy mcgrumpster,

04:44.752 --> 04:45.617
woke up today--

04:45.619 --> 04:46.652
grumpy mcgrumpsteen,

04:46.654 --> 04:47.552
and a voice was--

04:47.554 --> 04:48.420
grumpy mcgrumpacuddy,

04:48.422 --> 04:48.420
older--

04:48.422 --> 04:50.122
grumpy mcgrumperpants,

04:50.124 --> 04:50.989
than my heart,--

04:50.991 --> 04:52.124
grumpy mcgrumpcake.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.258
Please, be
quiet, whitless.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.393
--Which
carries a scar.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.094
You just
proved my point.

04:58.164 --> 04:59.531
Please tell me we're there.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.365
The dreams
that I've been dreamin'--

05:00.367 --> 05:00.365
what?

05:00.367 --> 05:02.634
Bears don't wear hats.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.869
No, grandpa.

05:03.871 --> 05:04.803
--Take me
back to Kentucky.

05:04.805 --> 05:05.971
Are we there yet?

05:05.973 --> 05:07.239
Eh, almost.

05:07.241 --> 05:08.940
Ooh, look, there's Paul bunyan.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.643
Well, we're halfway home.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.891
He sure is big.

05:25.893 --> 05:29.061
It's just another
statue, whitless.

05:29.063 --> 05:30.362
I didn't think he was real.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.831
We read all about him in school.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.300
He was the world's
greatest lumberjack.

05:35.302 --> 05:38.236
A folk hero of the
American frontier.

05:38.238 --> 05:41.239
Hey now, just because
there are folk tales

05:41.241 --> 05:45.243
about a man doesn't mean at one
time he didn't really exist.

05:45.245 --> 05:48.513
How do you two think legends
get started, anyways?

05:56.422 --> 05:59.458
You know, as much as i
like visiting the big city,

05:59.460 --> 06:05.030
it sure is nice to come
home to some familiar faces.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.465
Hey, how are ya?

06:06.467 --> 06:06.465
Hey!

06:06.467 --> 06:09.368
You know, delbert
hasn't changed a lick

06:09.370 --> 06:11.470
since your grandma
and I were kids.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.705
Ooh, which reminds me,
we have to pick her up

06:13.707 --> 06:15.607
before we head to the farm.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.509
Pick her up?

06:17.511 --> 06:18.610
Oh, there she is.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.384
If I see one more
broken down farm truck,

06:25.386 --> 06:28.387
I swear I'm going
to break something.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.555
I mean what a friggin' cliche.

06:30.557 --> 06:30.555
Just look at that one.

06:30.557 --> 06:34.025
Old Freddy farmer out there
picking up his pain-in-the-neck

06:34.027 --> 06:35.227
blue-haired wife.

06:40.299 --> 06:43.168
Iris, what the
heck are you doing?

06:43.170 --> 06:44.669
Excuse me, sir.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.339
You told me to notify you
when your commercial is on.

06:47.341 --> 06:48.740
What?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.842
Want to
make the perfect deal?

06:50.844 --> 06:52.978
Then call blandsford
development,

06:52.980 --> 06:54.613
where perfection is the norm.

06:57.183 --> 07:00.051
What could you
possibly be writing?

07:00.053 --> 07:01.319
Some notes, sir.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.621
I think the graphics
could use some work.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.257
And you were a little
stiff in that take.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.526
Did I ask you to take notes?

07:07.528 --> 07:10.028
I didn't hire you for
your opinions, Iris.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.365
You better watch it, or your
first week will be your last.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.167
My first week of what, sir?

07:15.169 --> 07:19.871
Of working here, Iris.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.072
Get it together.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.574
Now how many deeds
did you get today?

07:22.576 --> 07:27.679
Oh, one family accepted your
offer, sir, out of the 20

07:27.681 --> 07:27.679
I called today.

07:27.681 --> 07:31.349
I've color-coded the file,
orange for oleson family,

07:31.351 --> 07:33.752
since oleson starts with
"o" and so does the word--

07:33.754 --> 07:34.519
one property?

07:34.521 --> 07:36.688
One property?

07:36.690 --> 07:41.426
A measly one property?

07:41.428 --> 07:43.829
What is wrong with these people?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.997
I don't think there's
anything wrong with them, sir.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.967
I found that the majority just
don't want to sell their farms

07:48.969 --> 07:50.168
and businesses.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.070
They really like
living in delbert.

07:52.072 --> 07:55.640
What is there to like, Iris?

07:55.642 --> 07:55.640
Answer me that.

07:55.642 --> 07:59.110
Delbert county is a
pathetic Hicksville filled

07:59.112 --> 08:02.180
with backwards nincompoops.

08:02.182 --> 08:06.451
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

08:06.453 --> 08:11.056
I'm gonna need to call Bob.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.225
Bob?

08:13.227 --> 08:15.393
Blackstone.

08:15.395 --> 08:19.364
Oh, blackstone,
right, of course.

08:19.366 --> 08:22.300
Sir, one question,
who is blackstone?

08:27.073 --> 08:29.708
I am the great and
mysterious blackstone.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.682
Now, look into my hand.

08:37.683 --> 08:38.783
Yes, the lights.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.184
The lights.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.888
When I, the amazing
blackstone, snap my fingers,

08:42.890 --> 08:47.492
you will follow my every word,
perform every deed I command.

08:47.494 --> 08:48.593
Mhm.

08:52.198 --> 08:56.134
You
are now, a chicken.

09:03.043 --> 09:03.808
Monkey.

09:05.979 --> 09:06.978
Rock star.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.952
Sleep.

09:15.556 --> 09:15.554
Eee-oop.

09:15.556 --> 09:19.658
When you awake, you'll
remember nothing.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.626
Zob-key-boz.

09:25.865 --> 09:27.599
Ahh, haha.

09:31.437 --> 09:35.307
--Unappreciative
neanderthals.

09:35.309 --> 09:38.543
Don't they recognize
brilliance when they see it?

09:38.545 --> 09:41.813
How many more weeks are we
booked in this so-called venue?

09:41.815 --> 09:45.216
They didn't renew
our contract, boss.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.056
Hello, Mr.
blackstone, I'm calling

09:51.058 --> 09:53.892
from norm blandsford's office.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.194
And your point is?

09:56.196 --> 09:57.462
H-he'd like to see you, sir.

09:57.464 --> 10:01.933
He said he'd make
it worth your while.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.670
How much worth my while?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.007
Oh.

10:17.249 --> 10:19.250
Well, here we are.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.119
Home at last.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.088
I get mom's old room!

10:29.028 --> 10:33.465
So, which blue ribbon are you
aiming for this year, granddad?

10:33.467 --> 10:38.436
Oh, I've got my eye on
biggest cabbage, mm-hm.

10:38.438 --> 10:41.806
Can't wait to show
you kids the crops.

10:41.808 --> 10:47.145
Got some regular monsters
growin' out there, boy howdy.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.447
Oh, they can see
'em tomorrow, honey.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.417
The kids need time to unpack
and get ready for bed.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.919
So what's going on with
the picketing, grandma?

10:54.921 --> 10:57.455
A company called
blandsford development is

10:57.457 --> 10:59.124
trying to take over our town.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.259
And I'm protesting.

11:01.261 --> 11:01.993
Huh?

11:01.995 --> 11:03.428
What's that?

11:03.430 --> 11:06.498
--I'm just telling
Travis about my protest!

11:06.500 --> 11:07.399
What do you mean?

11:07.401 --> 11:08.733
I just had it checked.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.735
No, protest!

11:10.737 --> 11:15.073
You know Travis, your grandma's
the town's first activist.

11:17.476 --> 11:19.010
Grandma, look!

11:19.012 --> 11:22.247
I've grown approximately three
inches since last summer.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.016
That comes up to
7.62 centimeters.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.518
It sounds bigger in metric.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.886
Your turn, Travis.

11:31.290 --> 11:32.357
It's ok.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.592
Kids grow at different rates.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.961
I'm going to go brush my
teeth and get ready for bed

11:36.963 --> 11:38.196
like mom said.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.498
It's not even
dark yet, Whitney.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.600
You know what grandpa
says.

11:42.602 --> 11:45.270
Early to bed, early to rise.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.906
Wait, how early is early?

11:55.649 --> 11:57.949
"Woo hoo hoo,

11:57.951 --> 12:01.653
it's time to wake up
on the sunny side.

12:01.655 --> 12:05.256
Today is another time to try.

12:06.259 --> 12:09.227
Making everything all right.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.633
Rainbows
glowing in the sky

12:17.104 --> 12:20.805
every morning
and it makes me smile.

12:20.807 --> 12:27.979
Now the day ahead
looks like a dream.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.748
Woo hoo hoo.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.016
It's time to wake up
on the sunny side.

12:33.320 --> 12:37.455
Today is
another time to try.

12:37.457 --> 12:41.459
Making everything all right.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.830
Woo hoo hoo.

12:45.832 --> 12:49.834
When my eyes see
the rays of light,

12:49.836 --> 12:54.405
the day ahead seems
fun and bright.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.908
Love having you
right by my side.

13:00.679 --> 13:06.251
Rainbows glowing in
the sky every morning

13:06.253 --> 13:09.053
and it makes me smile.

13:09.055 --> 13:13.258
Nothing is as hard
as it first seemed.

13:17.029 --> 13:23.601
Sunshine and rainbows,
outside my window.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.671
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

13:37.583 --> 13:41.553
Wake up wake
up, wake up, woo hoo hoo.

13:41.555 --> 13:43.755
It's time to wake up

13:43.757 --> 13:43.755
wow

13:43.757 --> 13:43.755
--on the sunny side.

13:43.757 --> 13:52.530
Today is another time to try
making everything all right.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.901
All right,
all right, all right.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.503
It's time to

13:58.505 --> 14:00.905
wake up on the sunny side.

14:00.907 --> 14:09.180
It's time
to wake up on the sunny side."

14:09.182 --> 14:10.415
Whatcha doing, grandpa?

14:10.417 --> 14:12.617
Oh, Travis, my boy.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.085
You snuck up on me.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.421
Oh, sorry grandpa.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.957
Can you run into
town for me, Travis,

14:18.959 --> 14:21.960
on official county
fair business?

14:21.962 --> 14:21.960
Sure.

14:21.962 --> 14:25.964
Go to Mundy's general store
and pick up a tape measure,

14:25.966 --> 14:25.964
a long one.

14:25.966 --> 14:31.369
I think we have ourselves
a real contender here.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.671
You got it, grandpa.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.206
You're a champ.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.075
You are a champ.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.477
Just look at you.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.212
Hey, where are you going?

14:41.214 --> 14:42.747
Errand in town for grandpa.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.048
Oh, can I come too?

14:44.050 --> 14:45.383
Do chickens have lips?

14:45.385 --> 14:46.251
What?

14:46.253 --> 14:47.585
Of course not.

14:47.587 --> 14:50.521
They have maxillary and
mandibular beaks, why?

14:50.523 --> 14:51.623
Later, nerd face.

14:52.324 --> 14:53.291
Humph.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.315
Can I get you gentlemen
something to drink?

15:17.317 --> 15:21.986
We have root beer, sassafras
tea, or PR-prune juice.

15:21.988 --> 15:24.555
Just tell Norman
his brother is here.

15:24.557 --> 15:28.660
Oh, you're Mr.
blandsford's brother.

15:28.662 --> 15:30.428
Lamentably, yes.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.797
What is it, Iris?

15:32.799 --> 15:35.967
Your brother is
here to see you, sir.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.335
Oh!

15:37.337 --> 15:38.303
Hoo.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.210
Hello, Bob.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.111
Blackstone.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.513
My name is blackstone.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.481
What, off-stage too?

15:50.483 --> 15:51.649
That's ridiculous.

15:51.651 --> 15:55.453
It's my name.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.822
What's with that stupid accent?

15:57.824 --> 15:59.824
Is that supposed to be British?

15:59.826 --> 16:01.726
We're from Philly,
for crying out loud.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.528
Come on-- if you don't
drop the theatrics,

16:03.530 --> 16:05.163
I can't take you seriously.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.499
Funny, I was under the
impression you needed my help?

16:08.501 --> 16:10.335
Right, fine.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.302
Ok.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.403
Down to business.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.471
I need...

16:13.473 --> 16:15.440
That.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.208
The parking lot?

16:17.210 --> 16:19.510
Don't be smart, I'm
talking about the property

16:19.512 --> 16:20.645
I need to acquire.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.946
Everything you see
past that gate--

16:21.948 --> 16:25.149
the town, the farms,
that's what I need.

16:25.151 --> 16:25.984
Right.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.251
I'm off.

16:27.253 --> 16:28.486
Good luck with that.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.755
You just got here, Bob.

16:30.757 --> 16:31.923
It's blackstone, Norman.

16:31.925 --> 16:33.558
Don't make me tell you again.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.995
You know I've never cared much
for your little real estate

16:36.997 --> 16:38.997
deals, so I don't
know why you would

16:38.999 --> 16:40.565
think I'd be interested now.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.167
Can't you just
listen for one second?

16:43.169 --> 16:43.167
Hm.

16:43.169 --> 16:46.037
I've tried everything
with these people.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.638
I've tried making offers
they can't refuse.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.606
I've tried muscle.

16:48.608 --> 16:49.841
But no one wants to sell.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.542
One of them has even
started picketing.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.277
I need that town.

16:53.279 --> 16:55.713
And so I need you to
do whatever mumbo jumbo

16:55.715 --> 16:57.482
it is you do to get
people to do things

16:57.484 --> 16:58.950
they don't know
they're doing and then

16:58.952 --> 17:01.853
make 'em think they
wanted to do them.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.488
I believe the word
you're thrashing

17:03.490 --> 17:07.157
about for is hypnosis.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.292
Whatever.

17:09.295 --> 17:12.163
Will you help me or not?

17:12.165 --> 17:14.766
Hypnotize people into signing
over their property to you?

17:14.768 --> 17:22.573
Oh, well I suppose I could,
if the price was right.

17:22.575 --> 17:23.840
Here you go.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.377
And tell your granddad
i said good luck.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.612
I will Mrs. Mundy, thanks.

17:27.614 --> 17:28.246
Mhm.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.925
Keep
your eyes peeled.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.026
Mhm.

17:45.064 --> 17:49.300
Would you happen
to be Mrs. Mundy?

17:49.302 --> 17:49.300
Yes.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.702
How can I help you, sir?

17:51.704 --> 17:54.472
Hello, I represent
blandsford development--

17:54.474 --> 17:58.342
I've already told Mr.
blandsford I'm not interested.

17:58.344 --> 17:59.644
That's final.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.379
Oh, I think you'll reconsider.

18:01.381 --> 18:02.713
Ever seen one of these?

18:04.117 --> 18:08.453
Hm, uh, ooh.
I don't believe I have.

18:11.990 --> 18:12.957
Hm.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.358
Mhm.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.727
Oh, hm.

18:24.104 --> 18:28.072
Now maybelle, if you would
just please sign your name here.

18:28.074 --> 18:31.375
And here, here, initial here.

18:31.377 --> 18:32.677
Lovely.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.446
Now then maybelle,
when I snap my fingers,

18:35.448 --> 18:37.181
you're going to wake up.

18:37.183 --> 18:40.785
You will feel proud and
happy to have made this deal.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.321
Zob, key, boz.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.824
Oh, thank you sir,
thank you so much.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.260
No dear, thank you.

18:52.065 --> 18:55.533
You there, I'd like
a word with you, boy.

18:55.535 --> 18:56.834
Uh oh.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.436
Get back
here, you little urchin!

18:58.438 --> 18:59.770
The scoundrel!

18:59.772 --> 19:00.738
The brat saw me.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.739
Get after him!

19:01.741 --> 19:02.840
Right, boss.

19:05.511 --> 19:06.277
Get after him!

19:48.554 --> 19:51.155
Oh no.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.925
Whoa!

19:53.927 --> 19:55.259
Nice moves, kid.

19:59.231 --> 20:00.331
Not again.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.139
"I'm
not running away."

20:08.141 --> 20:08.940
Hello.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.909
Thanks, come again.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.879
Come back soon.

20:45.645 --> 20:46.644
You!

20:46.646 --> 20:49.680
You get back here.

20:53.019 --> 20:57.855
--Here,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.027
I'm gonna find you,
sooner or later.

21:13.906 --> 21:14.505
Huh?

21:14.507 --> 21:16.073
Hm?

21:16.075 --> 21:18.409
No, no, no.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.777
Get out, get out.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.680
Come on.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.715
Oof.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.884
I know you're up there.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.323
Whoa ugh, ooh!

21:42.034 --> 21:43.634
Hoo. Whoa!

21:54.946 --> 21:56.580
Whoa, whoa!

22:04.923 --> 22:06.524
Oof.

22:08.494 --> 22:09.493
Phew.

22:09.495 --> 22:14.498
Oh my-- ugh.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.839
Hello?

22:21.841 --> 22:24.475
Hello?

22:24.477 --> 22:26.177
Anybody here?

22:39.359 --> 22:40.458
Whoa.

23:12.624 --> 23:15.626
Fee fi, fo, fum.

23:27.272 --> 23:29.006
I can't remember the
rest of that rhyme.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.975
Something about
grinding up your bones.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.145
Easy there.

23:34.147 --> 23:37.915
I didn't mean to scare ya.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.884
Me and my stupid jokes.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.852
Sorry, I just
haven't had a chance

23:41.854 --> 23:44.255
to use the "giant"
gag in a while.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.756
Hey, how's that
bump on your head?

23:45.758 --> 23:48.025
Must be feeling ok if
you were able to get down

23:48.027 --> 23:49.160
from that chair.

23:49.162 --> 23:52.363
That's one heck
of a jump for you.

23:52.365 --> 23:56.534
Do you understand me?

23:58.904 --> 23:59.970
Good.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.672
I'm Paul, by the way.

24:01.674 --> 24:02.773
Paul bunyan.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.947
You must be hungry.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.615
I'm gonna whip us a
bunch of pancakes.

24:11.617 --> 24:14.251
How's that sound?

24:14.253 --> 24:15.820
What's your name?

24:15.822 --> 24:16.854
T-Travis.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.522
Travis barclay.

24:18.524 --> 24:22.693
Well Travis, my guess is
you're a long way from home.

24:22.695 --> 24:25.029
I found you knocked out
underneath one of those oaks

24:25.031 --> 24:26.230
over yonder.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.332
From the looks of
the trek you made,

24:28.334 --> 24:31.702
I'd say you slid down
a hollow tree root.

24:31.704 --> 24:32.970
Am I right?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.872
Yeah I think so, yeah.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.440
I know where you're from.

24:36.442 --> 24:38.642
And I know how to get you back.

24:38.644 --> 24:38.642
Don't worry.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.312
Let's get some
food in you first.

24:58.930 --> 25:02.032
You're really Paul bunyan.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.635
That's right.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.072
I'm coming!

25:08.074 --> 25:11.242
Keep your flannel on.

25:11.244 --> 25:13.077
Oh, hey now.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.012
A tiny kid?

25:15.014 --> 25:16.914
Hah, where'd he come from?

25:16.916 --> 25:18.782
Fell out of that root up-river.

25:18.784 --> 25:20.518
Out of the root?

25:20.520 --> 25:22.086
Well that means he's from--

25:22.088 --> 25:23.254
that's right.

25:23.256 --> 25:24.555
And that's where
he's going back just

25:24.557 --> 25:26.190
as soon as he's
had some breakfast.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.625
But he just got here.

25:27.627 --> 25:30.060
Aww, there's so
much to talk about.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.563
Eat your pancakes,
babe, then saddle up.

25:32.565 --> 25:33.631
Saddle up?

25:33.633 --> 25:33.631
Really?

25:33.633 --> 25:35.699
I'm not a mule.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.002
You know, you'd think after
all this time together, he

25:38.004 --> 25:39.937
might treat me like an equal.

25:39.939 --> 25:40.738
But no.

25:40.740 --> 25:41.906
Saddle up.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.440
Humph.

25:43.442 --> 25:44.975
That's why my back's all out
of whack in the first place.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.111
I really can't believe this.

25:47.113 --> 25:48.445
How is this possible?

25:48.447 --> 25:51.315
Maybe I'm dreaming.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.083
Oh what are you
trying to figure out?

25:53.085 --> 25:54.518
I thought you were a folktale.

25:54.520 --> 25:58.088
Hah, don't tell me
you've never seen an ox.

25:58.090 --> 26:02.660
I've seen an ox before, just
not one that was blue and giant

26:02.662 --> 26:02.660
and could speak.

26:02.662 --> 26:06.664
Plus the stories about you are
from a really long time ago.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.767
You should be really old,
like 100 or something.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.068
We're giants, kid.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.736
We're three times
bigger than you.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.539
And we live three
times longer than you.

26:15.541 --> 26:18.943
That's how come we've still got
the youthful good looks, huh.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.052
What is this place anyway?

26:28.054 --> 26:31.522
This here is red river
valley, where we were born.

26:31.524 --> 26:33.757
Paul and I moved back here
when he gave up the logging,

26:33.759 --> 26:37.428
and-- well, haven't been
back to your world since.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.730
Boy, I bet it's really
something now, huh?

26:39.732 --> 26:42.900
All the changes, the inventions,
the modern conveniences.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.603
I mean what are people
doing for fun these days?

26:45.605 --> 26:47.705
I don't know, tons of stuff.

26:47.707 --> 26:47.705
Like what?

26:47.707 --> 26:50.908
What's your favorite pastime?

26:50.910 --> 26:53.043
Sometimes I go to the mall.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.044
The mall?

26:54.046 --> 26:55.412
Haha.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.447
What is that?

26:56.449 --> 26:57.848
What do you do there?

26:57.850 --> 27:00.618
I hang out with friends
and, you know, just chill.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.453
You chill?

27:02.455 --> 27:06.190
Not "chill" chill,
like "brr chill".

27:06.192 --> 27:08.192
More like, just, "chill out".

27:08.194 --> 27:08.993
Hm.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.394
Chill out, huh?

27:10.396 --> 27:12.329
Afraid I don't see the
fun in that, but hey,

27:12.331 --> 27:14.431
who am I to judge?

27:26.678 --> 27:28.879
So, Travis, mind telling
me how you ended up

27:28.881 --> 27:30.447
falling through that root?

27:30.449 --> 27:32.549
Well I was at the general
store on an errand,

27:32.551 --> 27:34.318
and then this weird
guy came in, and then

27:34.320 --> 27:35.819
this other guy chased me in.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.122
And I ran into the forest
and hid in this tree trunk.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.123
And then I slipped and--

27:39.125 --> 27:40.557
someone chased you?

27:40.559 --> 27:41.825
Why?

27:41.827 --> 27:42.893
Who were they?

27:42.895 --> 27:42.893
I don't know.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.496
Miss Mundy-- the
owner of the store--

27:45.498 --> 27:48.065
she was signing these papers
and then the weird guy

27:48.067 --> 27:49.233
said this weird word.

27:49.235 --> 27:50.601
And then she shook his hand.

27:50.603 --> 27:52.236
And then this other
guy was after me.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.604
It was-- it was totally bizarre.

27:53.606 --> 27:55.906
Eh, you can say that again.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.908
There it is.

27:57.910 --> 28:02.246
Yep, grew up so big it broke
right through into your world,

28:02.248 --> 28:03.147
like a tunnel.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.115
Whoa.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.151
Let's get to climbing.

28:17.295 --> 28:18.328
I can find my own way.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.530
You don't need to walk me out.

28:19.532 --> 28:21.098
I'm sure you can.

28:21.100 --> 28:25.335
Truth is, I'm kind of interested
in seeing this forest again.

28:25.337 --> 28:28.906
A lot of time has passed
since I've been here.

28:28.908 --> 28:32.342
These were always
such beautiful trees.

28:32.344 --> 28:33.377
Red pines, mostly.

28:33.379 --> 28:34.745
Weren't they, babe?

28:34.747 --> 28:34.745
Mmhmm.

28:34.747 --> 28:37.214
Wait, I thought you
were a lumberjack

28:37.216 --> 28:39.950
and you chopped trees down?

28:39.952 --> 28:42.086
I did chop trees down.

28:42.088 --> 28:44.888
Doesn't mean I don't
appreciate a good forest.

28:44.890 --> 28:47.191
I'm happy to see
it's doing so well.

28:53.998 --> 28:56.667
Thank you, mr gladstone.

28:56.669 --> 28:58.902
It's a pleasure doing
business with you.

28:58.904 --> 28:58.902
No, sir.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.871
Thank you.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.176
Where's the boy.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.745
Uh, he got away.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.413
What?

29:09.415 --> 29:10.814
Get out!

29:10.816 --> 29:12.950
He was really hard
to catch, boss.

29:12.952 --> 29:12.950
Idiot.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.486
You couldn't catch a cold.

29:15.488 --> 29:19.156
Boss-- wait!

29:19.158 --> 29:19.790
Wait!

29:19.792 --> 29:19.790
Boss!

29:19.792 --> 29:22.092
Wait for me!

29:26.397 --> 29:28.398
There's grandpa's bike.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.500
Oh man.

29:33.471 --> 29:38.242
How am I going to explain this?

29:38.244 --> 29:42.112
Any sign of the
man who chased you?

29:42.114 --> 29:43.113
No.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.481
He was driving a black car.

29:44.483 --> 29:46.884
How far is it to your
grandparents' farm?

29:46.886 --> 29:48.685
It didn't seem all
that far this morning,

29:48.687 --> 29:51.321
but I had a bike then.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.923
Paul!

29:52.925 --> 29:56.927
Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul,
the kid is clearly traumatized.

29:56.929 --> 30:02.766
First he was chased by a hoodlum
who is probably lying in wait

30:02.768 --> 30:04.535
for him somewhere right now.

30:04.537 --> 30:09.773
And then he loses his only
form of transportation.

30:09.775 --> 30:12.643
I mean we've got to
escort him home safe.

30:12.645 --> 30:16.513
It's the only
decent thing to do.

30:16.515 --> 30:19.550
I know what the decent
thing to do is, babe.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.588
Wait-- what the
heck is that noise?

30:37.435 --> 30:39.670
What were those things?

30:39.672 --> 30:43.207
Oh, they sure stink.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.943
I guess they didn't have cars
the last time you were here,

30:45.945 --> 30:46.743
huh?

30:46.745 --> 30:48.612
Cars?

30:48.614 --> 30:53.750
Ooh.

31:00.391 --> 31:02.326
Hello, can I help you?

31:02.328 --> 31:03.760
I am a salesman, madam.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.562
I've got a great deal on
these brand new flashlights.

31:05.564 --> 31:09.967
I'm sure you've never
seen anything like them.

31:09.969 --> 31:12.402
Well, I'll be.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.171
Will you look at that.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.672
What's that grandma?

31:15.674 --> 31:18.342
Oh, Whitney, come
look at this toy.

31:18.344 --> 31:21.845
It's not a toy.

31:21.847 --> 31:25.515
What the--

31:25.517 --> 31:27.451
ah, who's this fellah?

31:27.453 --> 31:29.119
He's selling flashlights.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.220
What?

31:30.222 --> 31:32.356
Flashlights!

31:32.358 --> 31:33.190
They're so cute.

31:33.192 --> 31:34.324
How much for two?

31:47.205 --> 31:50.674
Um, there's not really
any wagons anymore.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.142
It's all cars.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.477
Here comes another one.

31:53.479 --> 31:56.046
Looks like an rv.

31:56.048 --> 31:56.046
Um, who's arvey?

31:56.048 --> 32:00.350
Boy are they going to
freak out when they see you.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.519
What do you mean freak out?

32:02.521 --> 32:04.688
Like surprised, and
scared, and shocked,

32:04.690 --> 32:07.257
and you know-- freaked out.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.258
Why?

32:08.260 --> 32:09.793
Because you're both giants.

32:09.795 --> 32:10.994
And you can talk.

32:10.996 --> 32:13.096
That is not at all
normal up here.

32:13.098 --> 32:13.096
He's right, babe.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.865
Keep your mouth shut.

32:14.867 --> 32:17.734
Well, what about
the giant part?

32:17.736 --> 32:18.869
Here, do this.

32:21.372 --> 32:22.239
What are you doing?

32:22.241 --> 32:23.373
Trust me on this.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.207
Don't blink.

32:24.209 --> 32:25.242
Don't breathe.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.643
They'll think you're a statue.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.211
Why would they think that?

32:28.213 --> 32:31.048
Because there's statues of you
and babe all over the place.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.183
Statues?

32:33.185 --> 32:34.451
Oh, look at those.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.652
They're so lifelike.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.354
We've got to stop
and get a picture.

32:37.356 --> 32:41.325
We've already taken pictures of
umpteen different Paul bunyans.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.793
How many more do you need?

32:42.795 --> 32:44.928
"I was
sitting stinking like a good dog

32:44.930 --> 32:48.131
drinking in the lap of my farmer
after all day working sedated

32:48.133 --> 32:50.901
I work well day to day."

32:50.903 --> 32:52.302
Dad, come on.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.738
Isn't this the same one
that we saw in Maine?

32:54.740 --> 32:55.605
"Awaken.

32:55.607 --> 32:56.473
My head is aching."

32:56.475 --> 32:58.041
They're so lifelike.

32:58.043 --> 32:59.142
"Loving pink
sky thank god I'm plowing."

32:59.144 --> 32:59.142
Who's that one I wonder?

32:59.144 --> 33:01.278
"Ease my pain
i work so well dumb down."

33:01.280 --> 33:01.979
Oh!

33:01.981 --> 33:01.979
Who knows?

33:01.981 --> 33:03.580
Must be someone famous.

33:03.582 --> 33:04.414
Take the picture, honey.

33:04.416 --> 33:05.248
Time's a wasting.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.149
Hold it, hold it.

33:06.151 --> 33:06.149
Get closer together--

33:06.151 --> 33:09.019
"I'm a
good dog, me and may habits,

33:09.021 --> 33:09.853
but I can't contain I ain't
never caught a rabbit."

33:09.855 --> 33:10.487
Psst.

33:10.489 --> 33:11.254
Beat it.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.190
Where's teepee?

33:13.192 --> 33:13.190
Everyone settle down.

33:13.192 --> 33:15.726
Your mother's trying
to take a picture.

33:15.728 --> 33:16.693
"Hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey."

33:16.695 --> 33:17.661
Put a smile on your face.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.229
Oh, come on.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.163
"How could
that boy with everything that

33:20.165 --> 33:20.163
he's got--"

33:20.165 --> 33:21.198
hold it.

33:21.200 --> 33:21.198
Ok.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.967
"Walk his own
momma to the chopping block?"

33:23.969 --> 33:25.268
All right, everyone
back in the rv.

33:25.270 --> 33:26.436
"Hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey."

33:26.438 --> 33:27.938
We're on a schedule here.

33:27.940 --> 33:28.638
"Wouldn't
you flip if your dog started

33:28.640 --> 33:29.773
talking?"

33:29.775 --> 33:30.407
Will you
beat it, you mutt!

33:30.409 --> 33:31.942
Blah!

33:31.944 --> 33:32.642
"Wouldn't
you trip if on two legs he was

33:32.644 --> 33:33.276
walking?"

33:33.278 --> 33:34.044
Ahhh!

33:34.046 --> 33:34.044
They're moving!

33:34.046 --> 33:36.246
They're talking and--
oh, get me out of here!

33:36.248 --> 33:36.246
Get me out of here!

33:36.248 --> 33:39.416
"I was in the
barn happy and willing 'till I

33:39.418 --> 33:41.618
looked up at the house and i
got these feelings."

33:41.620 --> 33:42.319
Yeah, ok.

33:42.321 --> 33:43.720
Yup.

33:43.722 --> 33:47.190
Glad you two think my
humiliation is hilarious.

33:47.192 --> 33:50.160
I bet nobody uses your
statue as an outhouse.

33:50.162 --> 33:50.160
Oh there it is.

33:50.162 --> 33:53.230
That's my grandparents
from over there.

33:53.232 --> 33:53.230
All right.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.365
This is as far as we go.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.801
You should tell your
grandparents about those men.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.302
They sound like outlaws.

33:59.304 --> 34:00.303
I will.

34:00.305 --> 34:01.905
Thanks for getting me back.

34:01.907 --> 34:06.376
Aw, can't we stick around for
a while, have a little look see?

34:06.378 --> 34:07.244
No.

34:07.246 --> 34:07.244
We're heading back.

34:07.246 --> 34:10.914
Ah, for Pete's sake, Paul!

34:10.916 --> 34:15.217
Why do you always have
to be such a killjoy?

34:15.219 --> 34:17.219
Whoa-- uh-- oh!

34:17.222 --> 34:18.522
Oh!

34:18.524 --> 34:19.456
Oh!

34:19.458 --> 34:21.690
Oh, oh, oh!

34:21.693 --> 34:22.893
Oh, what did I do?

34:22.895 --> 34:24.561
It's not you, kid.

34:24.563 --> 34:25.195
Whoa!

34:25.197 --> 34:25.195
Oh!

34:25.197 --> 34:27.563
Oh!

34:27.565 --> 34:29.099
What's the matter with you now?

34:29.101 --> 34:30.801
It's my back.

34:30.803 --> 34:33.203
Oh, oh, my back!

34:33.205 --> 34:33.203
Oh!

34:33.205 --> 34:35.338
This hurts!

34:35.340 --> 34:37.974
You could come to the
barn and rest if you want.

34:37.976 --> 34:37.974
Perfect!

34:37.976 --> 34:39.743
Ha, ha!

34:39.745 --> 34:42.679
What?

34:42.681 --> 34:44.915
I haven't carried that
axe in years, Paul.

34:44.917 --> 34:48.985
I forgot how heavy
that thing is.

34:48.987 --> 34:48.985
Whoah.

34:48.987 --> 34:52.656
Can't you let your old buddy
babe rest for just one night?

34:52.658 --> 34:53.322
One.

34:53.324 --> 34:53.322
Night.

34:53.324 --> 34:58.962
Tomorrow we go home-- no
arguing and complaining from me.

34:58.964 --> 35:01.131
No one will see you if
you stay in the barn.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.766
I won't tell my grandparents.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.634
Come on, Paul,
old buddy old pal.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.269
Please?

35:08.840 --> 35:11.274
Sorry it took me
so long, grandpa.

35:11.276 --> 35:11.274
Huh?

35:11.276 --> 35:13.310
What do you mean?

35:13.312 --> 35:15.212
It's just that I saw this
weird guy at the store,

35:15.214 --> 35:17.848
and then this other guy chased
me into the forest and made me

35:17.850 --> 35:18.915
wreck the bike, and--

35:18.917 --> 35:20.183
yeah, yeah, that
sounds like fun.

35:20.185 --> 35:22.285
But you gotta keep it down now.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.720
Grandma's asleep.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.555
Now you kids had better
get some rest, too.

35:25.557 --> 35:28.892
Tomorrow's a big day, you know.

35:28.894 --> 35:31.728
Let's see, what
have we got here.

35:31.730 --> 35:36.133
Six and-- ha ha!

35:36.135 --> 35:38.768
Six and a half feet, Travis!

35:38.770 --> 35:41.004
I'm gonna dream of
blue ribbons tonight!

35:52.950 --> 35:54.317
Hope you guys are hungry.

35:54.319 --> 35:56.286
I raided the fridge.

36:00.791 --> 36:03.160
Travis, I still can't
believe you didn't

36:03.162 --> 36:05.128
let me go into town with you.

36:05.130 --> 36:07.464
And I can't believe you
didn't get back here in time

36:07.466 --> 36:10.400
to help grandpa move the
cabbage onto the porch.

36:10.402 --> 36:13.403
Do you know how much
that vegetable weighs?

36:13.405 --> 36:14.671
Whitney, just calm down.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.306
I will not.

36:16.308 --> 36:20.010
That cabbage was like
5,500,000 pounds!

36:20.012 --> 36:22.479
I can't believe what an
incredibly inconsiderate

36:22.481 --> 36:23.713
jerk you are being.

36:23.715 --> 36:24.714
Uh!

36:29.855 --> 36:33.757
Paul, this is my
sister, Whitney.

36:33.759 --> 36:37.460
He's extremely big.

36:37.462 --> 36:40.397
He's like a giant.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.866
You're like a giant!

36:42.868 --> 36:44.501
Whit, this is Paul bunyan.

36:44.503 --> 36:45.802
Ahem.

36:45.804 --> 36:46.770
Oh, uh, yeah.

36:46.772 --> 36:48.371
And this is babe.

36:48.373 --> 36:49.606
My pleasure.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.575
He can talk?

36:51.577 --> 36:53.009
Yup.

36:53.011 --> 36:56.513
He's a talking ox.

36:56.515 --> 37:00.317
Talking blue ox.

37:00.319 --> 37:00.317
Ok.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.118
Hold that thought.

37:05.489 --> 37:08.391
I don't know what kind of joke
you're trying to play on me,

37:08.393 --> 37:10.260
but it's not funny.

37:10.262 --> 37:13.964
That man there must
be over 15 feet tall!

37:13.966 --> 37:16.233
And animals can't talk.

37:16.235 --> 37:19.002
Whit, that's Paul
bunyan and babe the ox.

37:19.004 --> 37:22.539
Talking blue ox!

37:22.541 --> 37:27.911
They're tall tales, Travis--
really tall tales in this case.

37:27.913 --> 37:28.945
Meaning myths.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.413
Meaning make believe.

37:30.415 --> 37:31.948
Hello?

37:31.950 --> 37:34.017
Grandpa said tall tales
grow out of true stories.

37:34.019 --> 37:35.485
Look at Davy Crockett.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.586
He was real.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.455
Davy Crockett?

37:38.457 --> 37:41.725
Who said anything
about Davy Crockett?

37:41.727 --> 37:43.793
I don't care about
Davy Crockett.

37:43.795 --> 37:50.367
I'm talking about those two guys
in grandpa's barn right now.

37:50.369 --> 37:51.534
Whit, listen.

37:51.536 --> 37:53.069
You can help us.

37:53.071 --> 37:57.674
What am I supposed to do for
a giant and its talking ox?

37:57.676 --> 38:00.343
Talking blue ox.

38:00.345 --> 38:03.780
Blue ox.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.116
Babe's hurt, and,
well, you're really

38:06.118 --> 38:07.584
good at that kind of stuff.

38:07.586 --> 38:10.353
You may be under the impression
that knowing first aid

38:10.355 --> 38:14.124
makes me a medical doctor,
but actually it does not.

38:14.126 --> 38:16.393
Yeah, but you're smart.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.128
True.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.095
Could you just
look at him, please?

38:23.234 --> 38:28.772
Where, exactly, are you
thinking about putting that?

38:28.774 --> 38:31.107
Please, just try to hold still.

38:31.109 --> 38:35.145
No offense, little
miss, but I think

38:35.147 --> 38:38.214
that we need to
travel into the city

38:38.216 --> 38:42.385
where there are sophisticated
doctors who could handle

38:42.387 --> 38:44.821
a special case such as myself.

38:44.823 --> 38:47.390
You're not traveling
anywhere, babe.

38:47.392 --> 38:50.827
Well, then I guess
I'll just die.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.330
All you've got is
a mild back sprain.

38:53.332 --> 38:56.166
There's no need to be
melodramatic about it.

38:56.168 --> 39:00.537
With a little rest and some
ice, you'll be good as new.

39:00.539 --> 39:04.641
Did you tell your grandparents
about those men who chased you?

39:04.643 --> 39:06.543
Grandpa's a little bit deaf.

39:06.545 --> 39:09.012
And tomorrow's the big
day at the county fair,

39:09.014 --> 39:10.980
so they have to be
up really early.

39:10.982 --> 39:13.149
What do you mean
you were chased?

39:13.151 --> 39:16.886
What men are you talking about?

39:16.888 --> 39:18.088
That's it?

39:18.090 --> 39:19.055
You had all afternoon.

39:19.057 --> 39:20.190
That's all you could get?

39:20.192 --> 39:21.858
You're no better than Iris.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.827
These things take time, Norman.

39:23.829 --> 39:26.496
Plus, we ran into
a little trouble.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.502
What are you talking about?

39:32.504 --> 39:34.104
One of the local
hillbilly children

39:34.106 --> 39:36.272
saw me at the general store.

39:36.274 --> 39:38.808
Gustav chased him,
but he escaped.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.343
That's not "trouble".

39:40.345 --> 39:43.847
"Trouble" is not getting all
the deeds signed over to me.

39:43.849 --> 39:47.751
"Trouble" is the biggest deal
of my lifetime falling apart.

39:47.753 --> 39:52.722
"Trouble" is not some brat
seeing your hocus pocus.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.291
Why do you even want that
pitiful farm land anyway?

39:55.293 --> 39:57.093
You don't even like the country.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.294
I don't need to like it.

39:58.296 --> 40:01.231
I just need to own it.

40:01.233 --> 40:04.667
It's part of the bigger
picture, where I'm filthy rich.

40:04.669 --> 40:05.869
You're already rich.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.370
And you're certainly filthy.

40:07.372 --> 40:09.305
I'm afraid you're going to
have to show me this bigger

40:09.307 --> 40:13.610
picture, Norman, if I'm going to
come up with a way to help you.

40:13.612 --> 40:15.245
Well?

40:19.817 --> 40:21.017
Fine!

40:21.019 --> 40:22.152
Over here, Bob.

40:22.154 --> 40:23.319
Stop calling me that.

40:25.623 --> 40:28.191
This is the bigger picture--
the biggest picture the world

40:28.193 --> 40:30.160
has ever seen!

40:34.064 --> 40:37.033
A mall?

40:37.035 --> 40:39.135
Yes.

40:39.137 --> 40:42.005
It looks like a factory.

40:42.007 --> 40:42.906
Exactly.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.140
Exactly!

40:44.142 --> 40:46.509
It's a mall and a factory.

40:46.511 --> 40:49.646
It's the world's first and
only fully automated shopping

40:49.648 --> 40:51.147
experience.

40:51.149 --> 40:56.319
This is bunyanworld.

40:56.321 --> 40:59.022
Named after Paul bunyan, the
most marketable icon this state

40:59.024 --> 41:00.490
has ever produced.

41:00.492 --> 41:03.293
Imagine, Bob, thousands of
cars on an assembly line.

41:07.665 --> 41:11.067
Bunyan.

41:11.069 --> 41:13.069
Bunyanworld.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.071
Bunyanworld.

41:15.073 --> 41:17.040
Bunyanworld.

41:17.042 --> 41:19.042
Bunyanworld.

41:19.044 --> 41:21.044
Bunyanworld.

41:21.046 --> 41:22.378
Bunyanworld.

41:22.380 --> 41:23.446
No more
wishy-washy nincompoops

41:23.448 --> 41:24.848
who can't decide what to buy.

41:24.850 --> 41:25.949
I decide for them.

41:25.951 --> 41:26.583
Ha ha!

41:30.354 --> 41:32.021
All the machines
will be computerized.

41:32.023 --> 41:33.490
No more whiney employees.

41:33.492 --> 41:37.227
Every ounce of
profit will be mine.

41:37.229 --> 41:39.295
If they can't pay,
I'll give them credit.

41:39.297 --> 41:43.533
Delicious, irresistable,
easy credit.

41:46.136 --> 41:48.838
They'll all be indebted to me.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.574
I'll own them.

41:51.576 --> 41:52.675
Ha ha!

41:52.677 --> 41:52.675
Well?

41:52.677 --> 41:55.178
As much as it
shocks me to say so,

41:55.180 --> 41:58.915
Norman, it appears we
aren't so different.

41:58.917 --> 42:02.452
What you want to do is put
people in a trance, do you not?

42:02.454 --> 42:04.521
You rely on expensive
gadgetry, of course,

42:04.523 --> 42:07.991
while I employ my
priceless natural talents.

42:07.993 --> 42:10.627
But still, it's hypnosis.

42:13.197 --> 42:15.031
Partners?

42:15.033 --> 42:16.466
Excellent.

42:16.468 --> 42:21.070
Now, how do we speed this
ingenious project along?

42:21.072 --> 42:23.406
That's what this
is all about, Bob.

42:27.678 --> 42:30.046
Delbert county sits in the
middle of all my property.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.481
Look, look.

42:31.483 --> 42:33.349
I can't build my dream
unless I have all the land.

42:33.351 --> 42:35.418
And these people--
these nincompoops--

42:35.420 --> 42:36.920
are standing in my way.

42:36.922 --> 42:40.390
We've got to speed things up.

42:40.392 --> 42:46.262
Is there any way you could
hypnotize all of them at once?

42:46.264 --> 42:47.764
Of course.

42:47.766 --> 42:50.567
It's just a small matter of
gathering the-- what is it

42:50.569 --> 42:53.536
you called them-- the
nincompoops into one place.

43:01.779 --> 43:04.914
You only came back
to walk Travis home?

43:04.916 --> 43:06.215
That's right.

43:06.217 --> 43:09.786
Well, why did you leave
in the first place?

43:09.788 --> 43:11.988
I was a young man
when I found the tree

43:11.990 --> 43:14.324
stump leading to your world.

43:14.326 --> 43:17.160
I like to explore,
and there was so much

43:17.162 --> 43:19.462
going on here, so
much excitement.

43:19.464 --> 43:22.865
Everyone was going west,
building the country.

43:22.867 --> 43:25.668
Babe and I got swept up
in the pioneer spirit.

43:25.670 --> 43:29.539
My size was an
asset-- babe's too.

43:29.541 --> 43:32.342
We could do more than
the average man and ox,

43:32.344 --> 43:35.445
so people admired
and looked up to us.

43:35.447 --> 43:39.349
And felt good to be appreciated
so we stayed around.

43:39.351 --> 43:41.217
Then things changed.

43:41.219 --> 43:42.919
Machines came.

43:42.921 --> 43:47.223
Big automated lumber mills,
chain saws-- trees started

43:47.225 --> 43:48.491
falling faster than ever.

43:48.493 --> 43:51.094
And soon entire forests
were being wiped out

43:51.096 --> 43:52.662
before our eyes.

43:52.664 --> 43:56.833
I started planting two trees
to replace every one that fell.

43:56.835 --> 43:56.833
That's how I was raised.

43:56.835 --> 44:01.504
But lots of folks
didn't like that idea.

44:01.506 --> 44:04.507
They thought I was standing
in the way in progress.

44:04.509 --> 44:06.409
They seemed different.

44:06.411 --> 44:08.411
They seemed greedy.

44:08.413 --> 44:10.580
Then it wasn't about
the adventure anymore.

44:10.582 --> 44:15.351
And soon I found my
heart just wasn't in it.

44:15.353 --> 44:17.787
I decided to take
my axe and go home.

44:17.789 --> 44:21.424
The sad thing is that i
don't think people even

44:21.426 --> 44:23.192
noticed we were gone.

44:23.194 --> 44:24.560
That's not true.

44:24.562 --> 44:26.663
Don't forget all of the statues.

44:26.665 --> 44:28.865
I'm telling you they're
everywhere from Maine

44:28.867 --> 44:30.299
to Minnesota.

44:30.301 --> 44:32.735
And we learned
about you in school.

44:32.737 --> 44:34.437
Really?

44:34.439 --> 44:37.240
What did you learn
about us in school?

44:37.242 --> 44:38.908
We learned that you
ate a lot of pancakes,

44:38.910 --> 44:41.210
and created the great
lakes, and the Grand Canyon.

44:41.212 --> 44:42.211
What?

44:42.213 --> 44:43.479
That's ridiculous.

44:43.481 --> 44:44.747
Don't lie, now.

44:44.749 --> 44:48.184
You always have liked
the pancakes, pb.

44:48.186 --> 44:49.852
No, I mean the other stuff.

44:49.854 --> 44:51.954
How can they teach
you that in school?

44:51.956 --> 44:53.356
That's nonsense.

44:53.358 --> 44:55.792
Well, obviously, great
lakes in the Grand Canyon

44:55.794 --> 44:59.629
were created millions of
years ago through erosion

44:59.631 --> 45:02.465
and the shifting
of tectonic plates.

45:02.467 --> 45:04.500
I've know that
since kindergarten.

45:04.502 --> 45:06.903
But there are all these
stories called tall tales,

45:06.905 --> 45:09.839
and you're definitely
the tallest.

45:09.841 --> 45:11.607
I'm
a tall tale, huh?

45:16.513 --> 45:17.847
How am I going to do it?

45:17.849 --> 45:19.415
How am I ever going
to get everyone

45:19.417 --> 45:21.284
assembled in one place?

45:21.286 --> 45:22.719
Think, norm, think.

45:25.389 --> 45:28.324
In local news,
developer norm blandsford

45:28.326 --> 45:29.959
is causing quite a stir.

45:29.961 --> 45:31.027
They're talking about me.

45:31.029 --> 45:32.261
Turn it up.

45:32.263 --> 45:33.663
With his attempts
buy all the property

45:33.665 --> 45:36.265
in delbert county for an
as yet undisclosed reason,

45:36.267 --> 45:37.600
blandsford has
aroused suspicions,

45:37.602 --> 45:40.136
and, in one case, a protest.

45:40.138 --> 45:41.671
What?

45:41.673 --> 45:44.540
They're giving airtime
to that crazy blue hair?

45:44.542 --> 45:46.209
You've got to be kidding me.

45:46.211 --> 45:49.011
Can you believe this?

45:49.013 --> 45:52.582
Norm blandsford won't
tell anyone what he intends

45:52.584 --> 45:55.418
to build on all this land.

45:55.420 --> 45:56.819
Why is that?

45:56.821 --> 45:59.188
And I don't trust him one bit.

45:59.190 --> 46:00.623
We're going to have
to move quickly.

46:00.625 --> 46:02.091
In other
news, the prizes

46:02.093 --> 46:03.993
for the largest produce
and finest livestock

46:03.995 --> 46:06.996
will be awarded tomorrow-- the
final day of the delbert county

46:06.998 --> 46:06.996
fair.

46:06.998 --> 46:09.632
These nincompoops
and their stupid fair

46:09.634 --> 46:11.267
make me want to puke.

46:11.269 --> 46:13.736
Goodnight Travis, Whitney.

46:13.738 --> 46:15.571
Thanks for your hospitality.

46:15.573 --> 46:16.706
Sure, no problem.

46:16.708 --> 46:17.907
See you in the morning.

46:21.211 --> 46:23.279
Wha-- what is that?

46:23.281 --> 46:24.480
What are you talking about?

46:24.482 --> 46:26.149
You can't hear that?

46:26.151 --> 46:28.284
It's making my teeth vibrate.

46:28.286 --> 46:29.986
Whoa!

46:29.988 --> 46:31.521
Whoah-ho!

46:35.426 --> 46:36.325
Babe?

46:36.327 --> 46:37.660
What's gotten into you?

46:44.368 --> 46:47.336
Whoah!

46:47.338 --> 46:49.205
What was that about?

46:49.207 --> 46:51.207
It was just an airplane.

46:51.209 --> 46:53.342
An air plane?

46:53.344 --> 46:54.977
You mean people
can fly now, too?

46:54.979 --> 46:58.614
Actually, a lot of lights you
see in the sky aren't stars.

46:58.616 --> 46:59.715
They're planes.

47:11.228 --> 47:13.062
So many changes.

47:13.064 --> 47:15.631
I think we're going to have to
say goodbye to you kids now.

47:15.633 --> 47:17.233
We're heading out
at daybreak, babe.

47:17.235 --> 47:19.235
Why do you have to go so early?

47:19.237 --> 47:20.603
What's the matter?

47:20.605 --> 47:22.905
I suppose you can
say I'm a little...

47:22.907 --> 47:23.973
"Freaked out".

47:50.668 --> 47:52.001
Oh, for crying out loud.

47:52.003 --> 47:52.001
Are you kidding me?

47:52.003 --> 47:54.804
This is like trying to
sleep in a lumber mill

47:54.806 --> 47:55.972
with all that snoring.

47:59.076 --> 48:01.410
Ah.

48:01.412 --> 48:03.379
Pretty lights.

48:03.381 --> 48:04.347
Wow.

48:07.117 --> 48:09.118
What a sight.

48:09.120 --> 48:11.888
Is that beautiful or what?

48:11.890 --> 48:15.358
I mean it looks like a field
of fireflies doesn't it?

48:15.360 --> 48:15.958
Oh!

48:15.960 --> 48:17.159
Huh.

48:17.161 --> 48:18.895
Good evening ladies.

48:18.897 --> 48:23.933
Say is that the town of
delbert, because if it is-- boy

48:23.935 --> 48:27.770
I haven't been there in, hm,
must be 100 some odd years.

48:27.772 --> 48:29.805
And back then it
was nothing more

48:29.807 --> 48:33.943
than a dirt road and a couple
of little wooden shacks.

48:33.945 --> 48:39.015
So that you ladies
live around here?

48:39.017 --> 48:41.651
Yeah, you know I'm just
in for the night myself.

48:41.653 --> 48:43.853
I've got a nice place
to stay over there

48:43.855 --> 48:47.590
on the other side of
the hill, and-- hello?

48:47.592 --> 48:49.358
Hello?

48:49.360 --> 48:50.693
Hello?

48:50.695 --> 48:52.194
Oh.

48:52.196 --> 48:53.262
So sorry.

48:53.264 --> 48:54.263
Beg your pardon.

48:54.265 --> 48:56.532
I didn't mean to disturb you.

48:56.534 --> 48:58.301
I'm just going to
leave you in peace, ok?

48:58.303 --> 49:00.069
I'm going to go.

49:06.376 --> 49:07.410
Ok.

49:07.412 --> 49:08.511
This is not going to end well.

49:11.548 --> 49:12.949
Be reasonable, litttle fella!

49:12.951 --> 49:15.518
Come on, it was an accident.

49:15.520 --> 49:16.118
Ow!

49:16.120 --> 49:16.118
Oh!

49:16.120 --> 49:20.122
Watch the horns!

49:20.124 --> 49:21.490
Oh, hey!

49:21.492 --> 49:22.491
Oh, whoa!

49:22.493 --> 49:23.726
Oh, whoa!

49:28.465 --> 49:30.466
Keep running.

49:30.468 --> 49:31.701
Just keep running.

49:42.413 --> 49:45.614
Ah, sweet mercy.

49:45.616 --> 49:46.849
Sweet angels of mercy.

49:50.620 --> 49:51.620
Ah.

49:51.622 --> 49:53.222
Must.

49:53.224 --> 49:54.123
Drink.

49:54.125 --> 49:55.091
Now.

50:20.717 --> 50:23.252
Hey, has, uh-- has
anyone seen the cabbage?

50:23.254 --> 50:26.322
Oh, Walter, you're
forgetting yourself.

50:26.324 --> 50:27.957
You already loaded it.

50:27.959 --> 50:27.957
What?

50:27.959 --> 50:30.726
You loaded it.

50:30.728 --> 50:32.361
You loaded it!

50:40.605 --> 50:41.570
Paul?

51:01.391 --> 51:02.425
All right.

51:02.427 --> 51:03.592
You kids run around, have fun.

51:03.594 --> 51:05.094
Grandma and me will
get the cabbage

51:05.096 --> 51:07.029
entered in the competition
and meet up with you later.

51:10.901 --> 51:13.869
Whitney, I need
you to cover for me.

51:13.871 --> 51:15.471
What are you talking about?

51:15.473 --> 51:16.705
It's Paul.

51:16.707 --> 51:18.274
He was supposed to
leave a dawn, right?

51:18.276 --> 51:20.543
But I heard him whistle for
babe just as we were leaving,

51:20.545 --> 51:23.112
which means he's still
here and may be in trouble.

51:23.114 --> 51:25.581
Travis, if he's in
trouble, what are you

51:25.583 --> 51:26.816
supposed to do about it?

51:26.818 --> 51:30.286
He's Paul bunyan and you're 12.

51:30.288 --> 51:31.253
Please, Whitney?

51:34.658 --> 51:35.591
Thanks.

51:51.309 --> 51:53.309
Paul!

51:53.311 --> 51:53.309
Travis?

51:53.311 --> 51:56.345
I thought you were
supposed to be at the fair.

51:56.347 --> 51:57.279
I heard your whistle.

51:57.281 --> 51:58.514
Is everything ok?

51:58.516 --> 51:59.381
What are you doing?

51:59.383 --> 52:00.749
Looking for prints.

52:00.751 --> 52:01.784
Babe's disappeared.

52:01.786 --> 52:03.018
What?

52:03.020 --> 52:05.955
It looks like he's
been gone for hours.

52:05.957 --> 52:07.223
I'll help you find him.

52:07.225 --> 52:09.391
That's all right,
it's not your problem.

52:09.393 --> 52:10.860
Yes it is.

52:10.862 --> 52:12.094
If it weren't for me, you
wouldn't be here right now

52:12.096 --> 52:13.696
and babe wouldn't be missing.

52:13.698 --> 52:15.264
You know what?

52:15.266 --> 52:17.333
I'm helping you look for him
and you can't talk me out of it.

52:28.478 --> 52:30.513
What in the world?

52:33.617 --> 52:34.617
Oh my.

52:34.619 --> 52:37.286
You know, I've been thinking.

52:37.288 --> 52:41.157
If I'm going to perform a
mass hypnotism of this scale,

52:41.159 --> 52:44.460
an increase in my
fee is in order.

52:44.462 --> 52:46.662
What are you talking about?

52:46.664 --> 52:50.032
I'm already paying you more
than you make in five years.

52:50.034 --> 52:53.802
What more could you want?

52:53.804 --> 52:55.237
Equal partnership.

52:55.239 --> 52:55.237
Equal?

52:55.239 --> 52:57.640
Equal?

52:57.642 --> 52:58.874
Ha!

52:58.876 --> 53:00.009
Be serious.

53:00.011 --> 53:04.013
What is it, Iris?

53:04.015 --> 53:06.515
Excuse me, sir, but I think
you should see something.

53:06.517 --> 53:10.519
You are this close to
being fired, Iris, it better

53:10.521 --> 53:13.522
be something big.

53:13.524 --> 53:16.292
What the heck is that thing?

53:16.294 --> 53:16.292
How shall I know?

53:16.294 --> 53:20.262
Some sort of farm
creature, no doubt.

53:20.264 --> 53:21.931
Is it alive?

53:25.001 --> 53:27.002
Regrettably, yes.

53:27.004 --> 53:29.405
It's ok, you're
going to be fine.

53:29.407 --> 53:31.073
Iris, call someone.

53:31.075 --> 53:34.076
Have them cart this
thing off my property.

53:34.078 --> 53:36.345
But sir, I think he needs a vet.

53:36.347 --> 53:36.345
I don't care.

53:36.347 --> 53:38.647
Just get rid of it.

53:38.649 --> 53:39.949
Go!

53:39.951 --> 53:42.551
That is the biggest
ass I have ever seen.

53:42.553 --> 53:43.619
What did you say?

53:43.621 --> 53:46.222
Just-- that's a big ass.

53:46.224 --> 53:47.089
What?

53:47.091 --> 53:48.257
Hmm?

53:48.259 --> 53:48.257
Oh.

53:48.259 --> 53:49.792
Yeah, yeah, right.

53:49.794 --> 53:51.060
Right, it's gigantic.

53:51.062 --> 53:54.263
But I think it's
actually an ox, isn't it?

53:54.265 --> 53:55.631
Wait a minute.

53:55.633 --> 53:58.500
Hold everything.

53:58.502 --> 53:59.668
Iris don't move.

53:59.670 --> 54:00.970
If you even breathe,
you're fired.

54:00.972 --> 54:02.838
I think I've finally got it.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.741
I figured out how we can do it.

54:05.743 --> 54:07.710
This ought to be interesting.

54:07.712 --> 54:09.078
We're talking about this ox.

54:09.080 --> 54:11.247
We're taking this ox
to the county fair.

54:11.249 --> 54:13.249
And why on earth
would we do that?

54:13.251 --> 54:16.118
Because we're going to
prop him up, paint him blue,

54:16.120 --> 54:18.120
and make him an attraction!

54:18.122 --> 54:21.890
We'll say he's babe,
the great blue ox.

54:21.892 --> 54:24.560
This is Minnesota
for crying out loud.

54:24.562 --> 54:26.428
The entire town will
want to check them out,

54:26.430 --> 54:28.931
and they'll all be
at the fair already.

54:28.933 --> 54:30.399
It's perfect!

54:30.401 --> 54:32.034
Yes.

54:32.036 --> 54:35.004
Yes, that might actually work.

54:42.512 --> 54:43.545
Oh, poop.

54:43.547 --> 54:44.580
Over here.

54:44.582 --> 54:45.681
What did you find?

54:45.683 --> 54:46.682
Just what I said.

54:46.684 --> 54:47.316
What?

54:47.318 --> 54:47.950
Poop.

54:47.952 --> 54:49.518
You mean--

54:49.520 --> 54:51.854
yup.

54:51.856 --> 54:53.155
There are his tracks.

54:53.157 --> 54:54.690
Good job, Travis.

55:02.832 --> 55:04.233
Oh, how awful.

55:04.235 --> 55:07.369
Who put that horrible
contraption on you?

55:07.371 --> 55:10.005
People can be so
disappointing sometimes.

55:10.007 --> 55:12.541
Woah!

55:12.543 --> 55:16.679
Boy, that one had
been building up.

55:16.681 --> 55:17.813
Oh!

55:17.815 --> 55:20.849
Oh, boy my stomach
feels like lead.

55:20.851 --> 55:24.186
You can talk.

55:24.188 --> 55:27.523
Well, if I don't have
a dang muzzle on, I can.

55:27.525 --> 55:28.857
Hey, what's going on?

55:28.859 --> 55:29.992
Where I am?

55:29.994 --> 55:31.694
You're at blandsford
development.

55:31.696 --> 55:32.961
Ok.

55:32.963 --> 55:35.631
And how far is that
from Travis' house?

55:35.633 --> 55:37.166
I'm sorry.

55:37.168 --> 55:39.968
I'm afraid I'm not acquainted
with anyone named Travis.

55:39.970 --> 55:41.737
I'm Iris.

55:41.739 --> 55:43.539
Well, pleased to
meet you, Iris.

55:43.541 --> 55:43.539
I'm babe.

55:43.541 --> 55:46.608
Would that be babe,
the great blue ox?

55:46.610 --> 55:47.943
Usually.

55:47.945 --> 55:51.013
You're really you-- i
mean him-- I mean babe?

55:51.015 --> 55:52.348
Well, as far as I know.

55:52.350 --> 55:56.051
But, man, I do not
feel like myself.

55:56.053 --> 55:58.320
What hit me?

55:58.322 --> 56:00.923
Did you drink any of
the water out back?

56:00.925 --> 56:03.559
Yeah, I might have
drank like half of it.

56:03.561 --> 56:03.559
Why?

56:03.561 --> 56:05.861
Because it's toxic.

56:05.863 --> 56:06.795
Poisonous.

56:06.797 --> 56:07.896
Poisonous water.

56:07.898 --> 56:08.997
Huh.

56:08.999 --> 56:10.499
Now I've heard everything.

56:10.501 --> 56:12.201
It is time to go.

56:14.404 --> 56:16.205
Hey, what is going on here?

56:16.207 --> 56:17.740
What's with the chains?

56:17.742 --> 56:18.874
I didn't see those.

56:18.876 --> 56:22.044
Oh, this is terrible.

56:22.046 --> 56:22.978
I'll go get the key.

56:22.980 --> 56:25.013
Will you be ok?

56:25.015 --> 56:25.647
Me?

56:25.649 --> 56:26.482
Oh yeah.

56:26.484 --> 56:29.151
No, I'll be fine.

56:29.153 --> 56:32.755
You know, occasionally i
get a little claustrophobic.

56:32.757 --> 56:33.822
Like right now.

56:33.824 --> 56:35.691
Get me out of here!

56:38.328 --> 56:40.329
Fresh air, fresh air, fresh air.

56:53.676 --> 56:55.878
Well, it's not the freshest
air I've ever tried,

56:55.880 --> 56:57.846
but at least I'm outside.

56:57.848 --> 56:59.681
Quiet, or he'll hear you.

56:59.683 --> 57:01.083
He, who?

57:01.085 --> 57:04.987
I think it's Mr.
blandsford-- my boss.

57:04.989 --> 57:09.291
Once we have all the property,
how soon can we start building?

57:09.293 --> 57:11.493
Stop with the we.

57:11.495 --> 57:14.062
I start building once
the land is cleared.

57:14.064 --> 57:17.099
You will get your
insanely huge paycheck

57:17.101 --> 57:19.735
and go back to whatever
dump you live in.

57:23.606 --> 57:26.842
How long will it take
to clear the land?

57:26.844 --> 57:27.743
I don't know.

57:27.745 --> 57:28.744
Six months or so.

57:28.746 --> 57:29.912
Why?

57:29.914 --> 57:31.413
Can't it happen more quickly?

57:31.415 --> 57:33.582
I was thinking something
like this might help.

57:44.461 --> 57:46.662
You need to go find
my friend, Paul.

57:46.664 --> 57:47.496
Paul?

57:47.498 --> 57:47.496
Paul bunyan?

57:47.498 --> 57:50.199
He's probably out there
looking for me right now.

57:50.201 --> 57:52.768
And boy, is he going to
be mad when he finds me!

57:52.770 --> 57:53.836
Where's the axe?

57:53.838 --> 57:54.470
Huh?

57:54.472 --> 57:54.470
Oh no.

57:54.472 --> 57:56.071
No, no, no, no.

57:56.073 --> 57:58.006
This is not good-- not good.

57:58.008 --> 57:59.475
This is not good at all.

57:59.477 --> 58:01.276
You need to go find
Paul right away.

58:01.278 --> 58:02.911
This is not good.

58:02.913 --> 58:03.512
Yes.

58:03.514 --> 58:03.512
Ok.

58:03.514 --> 58:05.280
You just tell me where he is.

58:05.282 --> 58:06.448
How do I find him?

58:06.450 --> 58:08.617
You know how to
whistle, don't you?

58:15.158 --> 58:16.058
That's it.

58:16.060 --> 58:17.893
She's definitely fired.

58:17.895 --> 58:18.994
Oh no you don't.

58:25.935 --> 58:27.002
Where is my dart gun?

58:27.004 --> 58:28.103
Ah, there it is.

58:36.412 --> 58:36.411
Ha, ha!

58:36.413 --> 58:39.214
Oh, yeah, baby.

58:39.216 --> 58:40.916
I still got it.

58:40.918 --> 58:44.152
Ow, who shot my a-- oh.

58:46.824 --> 58:48.323
You shot him?

58:48.325 --> 58:49.358
Quit your crying.

58:49.360 --> 58:50.993
It's just a tranquilizer dart.

58:50.995 --> 58:52.794
I had to subdue him, didn't I?

58:52.796 --> 58:55.898
And how are we supposed to
move him in that condition?

58:55.900 --> 58:56.899
He must weigh a ton.

58:56.901 --> 58:57.900
Relax.

58:57.902 --> 58:59.434
I've got just what we need.

59:20.558 --> 59:22.891
If memory serves me,
there's a good view

59:22.893 --> 59:24.493
from the top of this hill.

59:24.495 --> 59:28.063
We should be able
to see for miles.

59:28.065 --> 59:30.332
What's that over there?

59:30.334 --> 59:34.736
I think that's the company
my grandma's protesting.

59:46.482 --> 59:48.450
I wish I was as
big as you, Paul.

59:48.452 --> 59:48.450
Why?

59:48.452 --> 59:52.321
So I could do big things
like lift up a train

59:52.323 --> 59:54.656
or jump a building
like a superhero,

59:54.658 --> 59:57.259
or not be afraid of the
guys that chased me,

59:57.261 --> 59:58.894
or not be afraid of
the football team.

59:58.896 --> 01:00:04.900
You don't need to be big to
do big things. Shh.

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:05.867
Babe?

01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:06.835
Babe!

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:16.178
Oh!

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:22.217
Excuse me, miss, but why
were you whistling like that?

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:24.519
Oh, babe told me that's
how I could find you.

01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:25.354
You're Paul, right?

01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:26.521
Of course you are.

01:00:26.523 --> 01:00:27.756
You're defnitely
Paul-- Paul bunyan.

01:00:27.758 --> 01:00:29.124
That's right.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.025
And this is Travis.

01:00:30.027 --> 01:00:31.660
And you are--

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:31.660
uh, hello.

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:33.629
I'm Iris ingram.

01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:35.197
Babe wanted me to find you.

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:38.000
He said you'd be out looking
for him and you need the axe.

01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:40.902
But I couldn't lift it, and
babe's still chained up.

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:41.737
Hold on.

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:41.737
Slow down.

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:44.039
Babe's chained up?

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:45.040
Yes.

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:46.608
In Mr. blandsford's garage.

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:48.343
We've got to get
him out of there.

01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:49.411
Who's Mr. blandsford?

01:00:49.413 --> 01:00:50.479
He's my boss.

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:51.947
No he was my boss.

01:00:51.949 --> 01:00:55.417
I quit-- not officially,
yet-- but I'm not going back.

01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:56.952
I started working
for him a week ago,

01:00:56.954 --> 01:00:59.421
but he didn't think I was doing
a good job, even though it

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:00.555
wasn't my fault
that people didn't

01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:01.556
want to sell their farms.

01:01:01.558 --> 01:01:02.424
I don't blame them.

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:03.659
I like it here, too.

01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:05.694
But Mr. blandsford
brought his brother,

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:07.696
and they've been
working together and--

01:01:07.698 --> 01:01:08.930
slow down, Iris.

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:09.831
I'm sorry.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.033
Can you take us to babe?

01:01:11.035 --> 01:01:13.368
Yes, I can.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:15.637
Can you take us there now?

01:01:15.639 --> 01:01:16.405
Oh, right.

01:01:16.407 --> 01:01:16.405
Let's go.

01:01:16.407 --> 01:01:18.073
This way.

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:22.544
Having fun, dear?

01:01:22.546 --> 01:01:22.544
Oh.

01:01:22.546 --> 01:01:25.914
Where's Travis gone to?

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:32.087
He-- um-- uh-- he's
on the tilt-a-whirl.

01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:32.954
Yeah.

01:01:32.956 --> 01:01:32.954
He really loves it.

01:01:32.956 --> 01:01:35.624
All the tilting and
all the whirling.

01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:38.060
Well, I'm going to go make
sure he hasn't thrown up.

01:01:38.062 --> 01:01:39.027
Bye!

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:49.571
He's gone.

01:01:49.573 --> 01:01:52.507
Wh-- this is where they had
him, chained right here.

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:53.875
What happened?

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:55.777
Well, it looks like he
tore the place apart.

01:01:55.779 --> 01:01:57.646
Can you think of anywhere
else he might be?

01:01:57.648 --> 01:02:00.482
They were going to take
him to the county fair.

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:23.105
Come see babe!

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:25.640
Come see babe!

01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:29.411
The great blue ox, in the flesh!

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:30.979
Tonight only!

01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:32.114
Get your tickets!

01:02:32.116 --> 01:02:33.248
Free tickets!

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:35.117
Babe, the great blue ox.

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:39.521
Get that muzzle on him.

01:02:39.523 --> 01:02:41.590
We don't want any blue
haired bitties in hysterics.

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:48.396
Did you get the paint?

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:49.231
Mm-hmm.

01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:50.098
Well, get cracking.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.033
Come on.

01:02:52.035 --> 01:02:52.768
Blue.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:54.336
My favorite.

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:08.550
It's all to do with this.

01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:10.152
What is it?

01:03:10.154 --> 01:03:13.989
It's a mall-- the kind of place
i was telling you about before.

01:03:13.991 --> 01:03:17.058
Where you hang out?

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.527
Where's the town?

01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:19.961
Where's my forest?

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.534
They're going to
burn it all down.

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:29.171
Look!

01:03:29.173 --> 01:03:30.572
There's my grandparents' farm.

01:03:30.574 --> 01:03:33.742
Did your grandparents sell
their farm to this man?

01:03:33.744 --> 01:03:33.742
No way.

01:03:33.744 --> 01:03:36.111
They would never sell it.

01:03:36.113 --> 01:03:37.612
They love living here.

01:03:37.614 --> 01:03:39.514
Hardly anybody wants to sell.

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:41.850
Then how is he going to
get everyone's property?

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:48.023
Now, then.

01:03:48.025 --> 01:03:53.195
Now, maybelle, if you would
just please sign your name here.

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:56.698
When I snap my fingers,
you are going to wake up.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.167
You will feel proud and
happy to have made this deal.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:00.235
Zob-key-boz

01:04:00.237 --> 01:04:01.736
they're going to
hypnotize them.

01:04:01.738 --> 01:04:03.972
That what I saw blackstone
doing at the general store.

01:04:03.974 --> 01:04:07.442
He made Mrs. Mundy sign
her store over to him.

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:08.777
That's why he chased me.

01:04:08.779 --> 01:04:10.745
If they get everyone
together at the fair,

01:04:10.747 --> 01:04:14.583
blackstone can hypnotize
the entire town all at once!

01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:16.351
That's why they wanted babe.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:18.587
Paul, we've got to do something.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.758
Wait.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.595
Have you ever driven
your boss's car before?

01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:38.139
I'm going to push you
a little faster, ok?

01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:39.241
Not too fast, please.

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:40.308
I usually don't drive.

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:42.177
I'm more of a two-wheel person.

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:44.746
Here we go!

01:04:44.748 --> 01:04:46.081
Straight to the fair, Iris!

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:10.906
Now, on to the prizes
for the biggest livestock.

01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:13.909
Third prize, for the
fattest pig, goes to--

01:05:13.911 --> 01:05:17.679
ladies and gentlemen, allow
me to interrupt, please.

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:19.781
May I have your attention?

01:05:19.783 --> 01:05:21.850
Tonight is a night
you'll remember

01:05:21.852 --> 01:05:23.818
for the rest of your lives.

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:26.821
Tonight, you will
be part of history.

01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:30.525
Your eyes will rest upon
that animal other people only

01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:32.427
know as a legend.

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:36.865
Where on earth is Travis?

01:05:36.867 --> 01:05:38.867
He wouldn't want to miss this.

01:05:38.869 --> 01:05:42.270
I'm sure he'll be here
in a second, grandma.

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:46.541
You will be able to say you saw
this legend in person-- right

01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:50.679
here at your little county fair.

01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:55.684
Ladies and gentleman,
we present to you--

01:05:55.686 --> 01:05:58.887
babe, the great blue ox!

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:03.591
Babe?

01:06:06.195 --> 01:06:07.162
Babe!

01:06:11.834 --> 01:06:12.801
Babe!

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:22.410
Travis, where are you?

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:25.780
Oh, I don't drive!

01:06:25.782 --> 01:06:29.751
I don't have my license!

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:32.320
What's that?

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:33.722
The engine started.

01:06:33.724 --> 01:06:36.891
Slow down, hit the brakes.

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:37.692
I can't!

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:39.260
That was the gas pedal.

01:06:39.262 --> 01:06:41.863
Oh, it's so much faster and
less dangerous than my bicycle,

01:06:41.865 --> 01:06:44.299
but I still can't control it!

01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:49.270
Woah!

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:56.978
Right, right, right!

01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:59.547
Oh, we're going
so fast, I just--

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:05.120
can we stop for
a bathroom break?

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:15.897
Oh, no!

01:07:15.899 --> 01:07:16.998
Slow down.

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:25.073
This, ladies and gentlemen, is
your state's beloved tall tale

01:07:25.075 --> 01:07:26.341
come to life.

01:07:26.343 --> 01:07:28.910
Look at his magnificent size.

01:07:28.912 --> 01:07:31.813
Gaze upon his stature.

01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:34.149
Stare at his blue coat.

01:07:37.753 --> 01:07:39.087
Stare at it.

01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:41.756
Listen to the sound of my voice.

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:44.092
Feel yourself getting sleepy.

01:07:44.094 --> 01:07:48.997
Feel your mind fall
under my control.

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:56.237
You've gotta believe us.

01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:57.338
It's the truth.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.940
Paul bunyan, you say?

01:07:58.942 --> 01:07:58.940
Yes.

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:00.575
He was right behind us.

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:03.511
Didn't you see him?

01:08:03.513 --> 01:08:04.913
No.

01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:07.649
We need to get to the
fair as soon as possible.

01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:09.350
We have to stop the hypnosis.

01:08:09.352 --> 01:08:11.386
And we have to help babe.

01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:12.587
Babe?

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:13.621
Babe!

01:08:13.623 --> 01:08:16.691
The great blue ox, of course.

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:18.426
Heh, heh, heh.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.328
Sign here, here,
and initial here.

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:22.296
Next!

01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:27.035
Sign here, here,
and initial here.

01:08:27.037 --> 01:08:27.035
Next!

01:08:27.037 --> 01:08:29.571
Sign here, here,
and initial here.

01:08:29.573 --> 01:08:30.537
Next!

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:36.176
Sign here, here,
and initial here.

01:08:36.179 --> 01:08:36.176
Next!

01:08:36.179 --> 01:08:38.212
Grandpa!

01:08:39.747 --> 01:08:41.616
Sign here, here,
and initial here.

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:42.484
Next!

01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:45.420
What are you doing?

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:47.488
Grandma, it's me, Whitney!

01:08:47.491 --> 01:08:48.857
What's wrong?

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:50.492
You're making a mistake.

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:51.859
We've got to get to the fair.

01:08:51.862 --> 01:08:53.795
Why won't you believe us?

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.229
Oh, I don't know.

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:57.131
Maybe it's because
bunyan and babe

01:08:57.134 --> 01:08:59.399
are tall tales that
haven't been told

01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:03.270
since the turn of the
century-- the last century.

01:09:03.273 --> 01:09:06.573
Never heard them used to get out
of a speeding ticket, though.

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:08.743
Gotta say, that's a new one.

01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:12.313
Wait!

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:13.481
That's him.

01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:17.685
That's who?

01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:20.154
Oh, there you two are.

01:09:20.157 --> 01:09:21.256
Ho.

01:09:26.194 --> 01:09:27.662
What do you think you're doing?

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:30.465
I think it's quite clear.

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:32.200
Don't be smart.

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:32.200
Hand them over.

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:36.571
Would you get that cheap
flashlight out of my face.

01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:38.038
I'm warning you.

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:40.108
Give me those deeds!

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:43.077
I'm really so sick
of your screaming.

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:45.078
Too many years I've
lived in your shadow,

01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:48.917
considered your inferior.

01:09:48.919 --> 01:09:51.653
Tonight, it's time
to reveal the truth.

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:57.392
The truth is, I've always
outclassed and outsmarted you,

01:09:57.394 --> 01:10:00.028
but you were always too
stupid to realize it.

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:03.031
But unlike you, I'm
a patient person.

01:10:03.033 --> 01:10:09.504
But tonight, I will finally
collect my just reward.

01:10:09.506 --> 01:10:13.708
Clearly you lack the grace to
carry off my dramatic look.

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:18.446
Still, I don't think anyone
will notice the difference.

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:18.446
Do you?

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:23.151
From now on, Norman, you will
believe yourself to be me

01:10:23.153 --> 01:10:26.654
in thought, word and deed.

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:30.725
Tell me you understand, brother.

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:33.695
I understand, brother.

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:35.330
Goodbye, Bob.

01:10:44.039 --> 01:10:46.608
Where is everyone?

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:47.242
Travis!

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:47.242
Paul!

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:49.244
Over here, quick!

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:55.883
What's wrong with them?

01:10:55.885 --> 01:10:58.219
They're hypnotized.

01:10:58.221 --> 01:10:59.320
Oh.

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:05.493
Paul!

01:11:05.495 --> 01:11:07.395
Am I glad to see you!

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:14.602
Where are blandsford
and blackstone?

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:17.772
One is over there, and the
other one just took off, Paul.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:20.008
Sheriff?

01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:21.142
I'm on it.

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:23.678
Show me where the
other one went.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:28.516
Travis-- grandma and grandpa,
they signed over their farm.

01:11:28.518 --> 01:11:29.784
What are you doing?

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.819
I just need to
remember the word.

01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:33.187
What word?

01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:34.922
The word blackstone
used to release

01:11:34.924 --> 01:11:36.224
Mrs. Mundy from her trance.

01:11:36.226 --> 01:11:39.661
I heard him say it, but
i can't remember it.

01:11:39.663 --> 01:11:42.063
Woz, seeba, something?

01:11:42.065 --> 01:11:43.164
Ugh!

01:11:45.868 --> 01:11:47.468
Where's the axe?

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:48.836
Hang on.

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:50.104
Uh, hang on.

01:11:50.106 --> 01:11:52.974
Uh, the axe, the axe,
the axe, the axe--

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:54.942
don't tell me.

01:11:54.944 --> 01:11:55.977
Ah, come on.

01:11:55.979 --> 01:11:56.744
Let me think.

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:57.745
Let me think.

01:11:57.747 --> 01:11:59.080
The axe.

01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:00.615
You lost it?

01:12:00.617 --> 01:12:02.083
I didn't lose it.

01:12:02.085 --> 01:12:05.086
I was too busy being poisoned,
and shot, and chained,

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:07.555
and gagged, and
generally humiliated,

01:12:07.557 --> 01:12:09.824
to see where it went, ok?

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:14.796
You need to find that axe
while I go find blandsford.

01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:16.397
Torch the place.

01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:16.397
Ooh.

01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:18.433
Heh, heh, heh.

01:12:30.046 --> 01:12:31.079
Come on, come on.

01:12:40.255 --> 01:12:40.254
Hey!

01:12:40.256 --> 01:12:43.624
Boss?

01:12:43.626 --> 01:12:44.726
Wait for me!

01:12:57.539 --> 01:12:58.940
Get out of the way!

01:12:58.942 --> 01:13:01.042
The only one who's
going somewhere is you--

01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:03.411
and that's to jail.

01:13:03.413 --> 01:13:04.846
And who are you?

01:13:04.848 --> 01:13:06.381
Paul bunyan.

01:13:06.383 --> 01:13:07.482
Really.

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:16.257
But don't you think you
should stop worrying about me

01:13:16.259 --> 01:13:20.995
and be more
concerned about them?

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:23.564
Oh, dear.

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:26.501
Decisions, decisions.

01:13:26.503 --> 01:13:27.468
Boss!

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.468
Boss!

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:29.804
You waited, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

01:13:29.806 --> 01:13:32.173
Crush him, you imbecile.

01:13:32.175 --> 01:13:34.842
But-- but that's Paul bunyan.

01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:37.812
Oh, of course it isn't him.

01:13:37.814 --> 01:13:38.479
Huh?

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.751
Ah!

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.120
Coward!

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:47.688
Start pushing.

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:48.823
Huh?

01:13:48.825 --> 01:13:53.060
Zob-boz-- zob-key--
boz-key-zob.

01:13:53.062 --> 01:13:55.430
Travis, you need to hurry!

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:57.598
Hold on, I've almost got it.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.000
Paul!

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:00.001
Oh, no.

01:14:00.003 --> 01:14:01.369
What are we going to do?

01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:03.404
Remember what I said, Travis.

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:06.607
You don't need to be
big to do big things.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.793
The crowd is trapped in there
and we can't hold the fire

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:27.061
back much longer.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:28.930
The county fire
department is on its way,

01:14:28.932 --> 01:14:31.532
but they might not
make it in time.

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:40.475
Huh?

01:14:40.477 --> 01:14:41.476
Oh no!

01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:52.487
Paul!

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.389
Paul, where are you going?

01:14:59.761 --> 01:15:01.128
Travis?

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:04.131
I need that word.

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:05.733
Just keep trying.

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:31.192
Will this help?

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:32.527
Yeah!

01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:34.028
They had thrown it in
the back of the truck.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:40.001
I told you, I just needed
a minute to think about it.

01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:41.335
Ha ha, yeah.

01:15:41.337 --> 01:15:46.474
Babe, thank you!

01:15:46.476 --> 01:15:46.474
Um.

01:15:46.476 --> 01:15:48.175
Not enough water!

01:15:48.177 --> 01:15:49.010
We need some water.

01:15:49.012 --> 01:15:50.011
This hose is so--

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:55.716
zob-key-boz!

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:57.351
Zob-key-boz!

01:16:06.795 --> 01:16:08.596
Whoa!

01:16:08.598 --> 01:16:11.365
You know, you would think
if a guy was Paul bunyan,

01:16:11.367 --> 01:16:13.401
he might have heard
of the word timber!

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:36.090
Oh, my babies.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:36.724
Grandma!

01:16:36.726 --> 01:16:39.393
Grandpa!

01:16:39.395 --> 01:16:41.128
Those guys over
there hypnotized you

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:42.997
into signing over
your properties

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:46.634
so they can build a big mall!

01:16:46.636 --> 01:16:46.634
You!

01:16:46.636 --> 01:16:53.374
You stupid, greedy,
double-crossing hack!

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:58.045
This is all your fault.

01:16:58.047 --> 01:16:59.647
That's Paul bunyan!

01:16:59.649 --> 01:16:59.647
It is.

01:16:59.649 --> 01:17:02.650
It's Paul bunyan,
and that's babe.

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:11.692
It's damp, but it's
evidence, all right.

01:17:11.694 --> 01:17:13.027
It's his fault!

01:17:17.265 --> 01:17:20.368
Here, let me give
you a hand with that.

01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:21.569
He ruined everything!

01:17:21.571 --> 01:17:23.471
Shut it, you blithering
waste of space.

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:39.053
I'm allergic to paint!

01:17:39.055 --> 01:17:42.957
Oh, no, I have probably
already lost half my hearing.

01:17:42.959 --> 01:17:43.891
Hello?

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:43.891
Hello?

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:45.426
Are you talking to me?

01:17:45.428 --> 01:17:46.327
I can't hear you.

01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:47.161
I'm right here, babe.

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:47.862
Sorry.

01:17:47.864 --> 01:17:48.562
Say again?

01:17:48.564 --> 01:17:49.697
Hello?

01:17:49.699 --> 01:17:49.697
Hello?

01:17:49.699 --> 01:17:51.966
I see your lips moving.

01:17:51.968 --> 01:17:53.668
Hello?

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:56.170
We always knew you existed.

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:57.371
Excuse me, folks.

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:58.506
One second.

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.477
Mr. bunyan?

01:18:03.479 --> 01:18:08.549
You saved our
lives and our town.

01:18:08.551 --> 01:18:11.285
We just can't thank you enough.

01:18:11.287 --> 01:18:12.653
Glad to have helped.

01:18:12.655 --> 01:18:16.223
Your grandchildren were
both very brave today.

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:19.994
Well, I guess it's that time.

01:18:19.996 --> 01:18:21.128
I guess so.

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:23.030
I'm not so good at farewells.

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:26.233
Actually, he's not that
good at hellos, either.

01:18:26.235 --> 01:18:27.868
Goodbye, Whitney.

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:27.868
Bye, Paul.

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:33.741
I'm so pleased that you're
not just a tall tale.

01:18:33.743 --> 01:18:36.444
You know, Travis,
you're the real reason

01:18:36.446 --> 01:18:37.845
all these people are safe.

01:18:37.847 --> 01:18:40.314
We did a big thing
tonight, huh, Paul?

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:42.917
Yes, we did.

01:18:42.919 --> 01:18:44.552
We sure did.

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:53.194
Bye!

01:18:53.196 --> 01:18:54.929
Bye, Paul and babe!

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:36.837
Hello!

01:19:36.839 --> 01:19:39.240
Hey, Iris!

01:19:39.242 --> 01:19:40.207
Woah!

01:20:07.602 --> 01:20:09.203
Oh, mail call!

01:20:09.205 --> 01:20:10.171
Yeah!

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:16.310
What did we get?

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:17.077
What did we get?

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:18.813
When did we get?

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:21.949
Oh, this one's
a note from Iris.

01:20:21.951 --> 01:20:21.949
Ha ha!

01:20:21.951 --> 01:20:23.217
Really?

01:20:23.219 --> 01:20:24.118
What does it say?

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.821
None of your business.

01:20:26.823 --> 01:20:26.821
Ok.

01:20:26.823 --> 01:20:30.090
Heh heh.

01:20:30.092 --> 01:20:31.392
Who's the other one from?

01:20:31.394 --> 01:20:32.893
Who's the other one from?

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.300
What?

01:20:39.302 --> 01:20:40.301
Aw, come on.

01:20:40.303 --> 01:20:42.837
Don't leave me in suspense!

01:20:42.839 --> 01:20:45.072
It's from Travis and Whitney.

01:20:45.074 --> 01:20:47.908
Guess who they were for
Halloween this year?

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:58.552
Oh,
that freaks me out.

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:16.203
"Oh, how I wish

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:18.305
that I was big like you

01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:21.275
stronger in every way,

01:21:21.277 --> 01:21:23.377
bigger than life

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:25.446
I can see myself

01:21:25.448 --> 01:21:28.682
spreading a smile to everyone

01:21:28.684 --> 01:21:30.284
and I know this feeling

01:21:30.286 --> 01:21:32.620
is where I can be

01:21:32.622 --> 01:21:35.856
out of the shadows
of disbelieving

01:21:35.858 --> 01:21:39.293
lumbering taller than
the red pine trees

01:21:39.295 --> 01:21:43.230
come and follow me

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:46.000
I can do anything

01:21:46.002 --> 01:21:49.703
if I can dream it
then my life can sing

01:21:49.705 --> 01:21:52.940
with my friends all by my side

01:21:52.942 --> 01:21:56.410
we don't have to be
big to do big things.

01:21:59.614 --> 01:22:01.448
There are some days

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:03.784
I feel so small I know

01:22:03.786 --> 01:22:06.987
no one can hear my voice

01:22:06.989 --> 01:22:08.622
and I remember

01:22:08.624 --> 01:22:10.925
I need to use my strength

01:22:10.927 --> 01:22:13.928
from deep down inside my heart

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:17.631
so give me a reason
to show you my smile

01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:21.101
it's brighter than
a brand new day

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:24.772
the smaller the dreams
are, the harder to hold

01:22:24.774 --> 01:22:28.208
so bring on the mountains,
get out of my way

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:31.478
I can do anything

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:35.382
if I can dream it
then my life can sing

01:22:35.384 --> 01:22:37.718
with my friends all by my side

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.955
we don't have to be
big to do big things.

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:49.263
Don't have to be
big to do big things

01:22:49.265 --> 01:22:53.867
I know it's true, i
learned it all from you

01:22:53.869 --> 01:22:59.640
I learned it all from you, yeah

01:22:59.642 --> 01:23:03.544
sometimes big on the
outside doesn't mean

01:23:03.546 --> 01:23:09.083
you have the strength
to move a mountain

01:23:09.085 --> 01:23:13.220
or a heart

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:15.789
I can do anything

01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:20.627
if I can dream it
then my life can sing

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:23.197
with my friends all by my side

01:23:23.199 --> 01:23:27.301
we don't have to be
big to do big things.

01:23:27.303 --> 01:23:30.804
With my friends all by my side

01:23:30.806 --> 01:23:42.649
we don't don't have to
be big to do big things."

01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:43.951
"I was
sitting stinking

01:23:43.953 --> 01:23:45.319
like a good dog drinking

01:23:45.321 --> 01:23:46.720
in the lap of my farmer

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:47.888
after all day working

01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:53.227
sedated I work well day to day

01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.227
awaken

01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:56.130
my head is aching

01:23:56.132 --> 01:23:56.130
loving pink sky

01:23:56.132 --> 01:23:58.732
thank god I'm plowing

01:23:58.734 --> 01:23:59.700
ease my pain

01:23:59.702 --> 01:24:01.035
I work so well dumb down.

01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:04.738
I'm a good dog,

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:06.173
me and my habits

01:24:06.175 --> 01:24:08.642
but I can't contain i
ain't never caught a rabbit

01:24:08.644 --> 01:24:13.480
hey hey hey hey hey

01:24:13.482 --> 01:24:14.548
how could that boy

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:16.083
with everything that he's got

01:24:16.085 --> 01:24:18.285
walk his own momma
to the chopping block

01:24:18.287 --> 01:24:23.357
I said hey hey hey hey hey

01:24:23.359 --> 01:24:26.360
wouldn't you flip if
a dog started talking

01:24:26.362 --> 01:24:29.029
and wouldn't you trip if
on two legs he was walking

01:24:29.031 --> 01:24:31.331
I was in the barn
happy and willing

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:33.700
'till I looked up at the house
and I got these feelings."
