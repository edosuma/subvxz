00:02.180 --> 00:03.410
I can't have sex with you.

00:03.500 --> 00:04.750
No,I don't want to have sex,either.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.320
I mean,not--not now.

00:06.380 --> 00:07.280
What's this?

00:07.360 --> 00:08.630
It's my letter of resignation.

00:08.730 --> 00:11.250
It doesn't feel like our company anymore.

00:11.310 --> 00:12.330
I'm quitting.

00:12.410 --> 00:15.400
I am starting up a nonprofit,so welcome to the nerve center.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.420
I never heard my parents use the word "gay" until I told them I was.

00:18.500 --> 00:22.100
What you two are doing,it's not a union recognized by the church.

00:22.180 --> 00:25.520
I'd like you to consider replacing kitty as my communications director.

00:25.580 --> 00:27.470
This is so insane.

00:27.530 --> 00:30.300
I've got everything the state has on ryan lafferty.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.509
Let me earn the trust back.

00:32.590 --> 00:34.810
If I agree to do this,mom,no more lies.

00:34.890 --> 00:38.180
From now on,no more lies.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.710
Oh,hot liquids.

00:52.770 --> 00:54.610
Um,I can do two things at once.

00:54.660 --> 00:56.670
Justin,I really need to talk to you about something.

00:56.970 --> 00:58.170
Sure.

00:59.970 --> 01:01.660
Um,so sit down.

01:02.070 --> 01:03.610
A sit down-- it must be serious.

01:03.670 --> 01:05.750
Well,yeah,it is actually kind of serious.

01:05.810 --> 01:08.020
I found this file in my mom's office.

01:08.080 --> 01:11.220
Well,actually,I stumbled upon it,but I wanted you to look at it.

01:11.450 --> 01:13.460
It's information about ryan.

01:15.220 --> 01:16.720
Ryan?

01:19.170 --> 01:20.790
Bakersfield?

01:20.850 --> 01:23.670
What is she gonna do,go knock on hidoor?She has nothing to do with this.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.680
I have no idea what she's gonna do.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.040
Well,she has no right to do anything.

01:28.140 --> 01:30.880
I mean,my mom has been agonizing over this whole situation for months.

01:30.940 --> 01:32.340
She doesn't want ryan to know.

01:32.420 --> 01:33.810
-I'm gonna have to tell her. -No,no,no.

01:33.890 --> 01:37.050
Don't-- don't tell her.I really want to give my mom a chance to explain.

01:37.110 --> 01:38.930
We're doing this new thing where we're trying to rebuild trust--

01:39.010 --> 01:40.690
trust,are you kidding me?

01:40.790 --> 01:42.750
Look,I'm gonna put the file back where I found it,

01:42.830 --> 01:45.060
and if she denies looking into ryan when I ask,

01:45.130 --> 01:47.060
then we'll know she's lying.

01:47.180 --> 01:48.820
Maybe she has an explanation.

01:48.890 --> 01:50.520
This is your mom we're talking about here.

01:50.600 --> 01:53.120
Yeah,and your my boyfriend,and I'm trying to be honest with both of you.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.130
Well,honestly,if your mom finds this kid,

01:55.210 --> 01:56.850
my mom's gonna have a meltdown,okay?

01:56.930 --> 01:58.830
And I'm sorry.I don't feel like dealing with that.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.210
Well,I'm gonna deal with it.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.200
I told you that I would.

02:05.650 --> 02:07.820
Fine,do it your way.

02:10.669 --> 02:12.020
You know,I really thought of all people,

02:12.100 --> 02:14.810
that you would understand about making amends.

02:14.890 --> 02:16.590
I gotta get to work.

02:17.660 --> 02:18.980
What happened to my transcripts?

02:19.080 --> 02:21.360
Did you know the "queen mary" is docked in long beach?

02:21.420 --> 02:23.430
It says here it never fails to impress.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.630
Th-they're in a blue folder?

02:25.710 --> 02:26.820
What about venice beach?

02:26.920 --> 02:28.370
Do you think my parents would like venice beach?

02:28.450 --> 02:29.870
Kevin,I'm talking to you.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.060
Yes.I'm-- I'm listening.

02:31.150 --> 02:33.100
Yeah,I know,the "queen mary," it's docked in venice.You're not impressed.

02:33.180 --> 02:35.980
Not even close.Kevin,they're coming tomorrow.Fus.

02:36.970 --> 02:38.050
the kitchen.

02:38.100 --> 02:43.400
Kevin,my parents-- the same parents who boycotted our commitment ceremony-- are coming.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.560
It's the equivalent of the berlin wall coming down,

02:45.630 --> 02:47.280
and I know you're crazed with work,

02:47.360 --> 02:50.850
but it would be nice if we could have an actual conversation when you're in the same room.

02:50.930 --> 02:52.340
I'm so sorry.

02:52.420 --> 02:54.410
I'm all yours.Really.What's the plan?

02:54.470 --> 02:57.230
Okay,first I need to--I need to book them a hotel room.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.330
Let me do that.

02:58.410 --> 02:59.740
The firm gets a great rate at the "W.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.140
" What's your dad's drink of choice?

03:01.200 --> 03:02.760
-Bourbon. -Great.I'll pick up a bottle.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.530
Oh,and would you mind getting a signed photo of kitty for my mom?

03:05.600 --> 03:08.080
She used to be obsessed with her radio show.

03:08.150 --> 03:09.680
Just her?How about both of them?

03:09.740 --> 03:11.360
Two smiling republicans for the price of one.

03:11.420 --> 03:12.750
Are you mocking me or being nice?

03:12.810 --> 03:13.770
Both.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.030
-Anything else? -No.

03:15.090 --> 03:18.940
Just meet us at bradbury's at 7:00,and don't spend the entire time checking your cell phone.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.440
-7:00? -Y-yes.

03:20.520 --> 03:23.800
My mother read some article about their patio there and made a reservation weeks ago.

03:23.880 --> 03:24.980
Why don't we do 9:00?

03:25.060 --> 03:25.910
It's so much more fashionable.

03:25.990 --> 03:27.050
My parents aren't fashionable.

03:27.130 --> 03:28.990
It's past their bedtime.

03:29.530 --> 03:30.370
w-what?

03:30.450 --> 03:34.210
Okay,I think they're gonna announce the new partner tomorrow night.

03:34.290 --> 03:35.670
Kevin,you said that last week.

03:35.750 --> 03:38.890
Yeah,I know,but the rumor is they're gonna do this whole g cocktail thing,

03:38.950 --> 03:41.730
and then it's gonna be me,you know?I've done it.

03:41.780 --> 03:44.450
You know,even after losing ojai foods,I've done it.

03:44.530 --> 03:46.310
Come on.Look on the bright side.

03:46.370 --> 03:47.830
I'd--I'd be arriving as partner.

03:47.890 --> 03:49.720
You parents might actually be impressed.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.290
Look,why don't I just meet you for dessert?

03:51.350 --> 03:52.110
No,no.I need you to be there.

03:52.110 --> 03:54.580
Okay,just have your secretary change it to 9:00.

03:54.660 --> 03:57.370
And one more thing-- I...

03:57.410 --> 04:01.290
don't be mad,but I was thinking maybe we could keep the,um,P.D.A.

04:01.370 --> 04:03.540
Down to a minimum.

04:03.620 --> 04:08.100
What happened to your favorite chant,we're here,we're queer,get used to it?

04:08.160 --> 04:09.350
You've met my parents.

04:09.430 --> 04:10.630
Yes,I have,and they do scare me,

04:10.690 --> 04:13.200
so I won't antagonize them by french kissing you in front of them.

04:13.260 --> 04:15.010
I promise to make it up to you when they're gone.

04:15.070 --> 04:16.390
You better.

04:16.470 --> 04:18.019
Go,make partner.

04:28.650 --> 04:30.560
You took out everything but the cobwebs.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.840
I cleaned up all of them,too,didn't I?

04:32.920 --> 04:34.020
Hi,sweetheart.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.690
So I read your financials.Your grant proposal is fabulous.

04:36.690 --> 04:39.300
-Oh,great. -Look at the monkey.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.820
Yes.

04:40.900 --> 04:42.840
William's famous monkey.

04:45.130 --> 04:48.040
When william was in this office,I was afraid to even knock.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.030
I didn't want to interrupt his concentration.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.370
Yeah,well,it's your office now,honeybunch.

04:52.450 --> 04:54.380
It's still daunting.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.370
As a businessman,he's a tough act to follow.

04:57.460 --> 04:59.170
Nora,I have known you my entire life.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.030
Insecurity was never one of your issues.

05:01.130 --> 05:03.740
Well,if I was so secure,then how come I married a man

05:03.820 --> 05:06.800
who never encouraged me to be anything except a wife and a mother?

05:06.880 --> 05:07.900
What are you talking about?

05:07.980 --> 05:10.420
You have been doing charity work for years and years.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.480
I've been throwing parties.

05:12.580 --> 05:17.070
I have to raise $17 million before I can even open this house.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.430
I can't even make one damn chart.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.280
What?Let me see.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.050
Why do these people need visual aids?

05:24.150 --> 05:26.480
Why can't they just sit there and listen?

05:26.680 --> 05:30.780
And--and supposedly,it's bad form if you put more than six words on a slide.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.690
That's not communicating.It's haiku.

05:32.690 --> 05:33.890
No.

05:33.950 --> 05:35.940
That is a perfect pie chart.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.740
oh,I hate you.

05:37.820 --> 05:38.860
you did it.

05:38.940 --> 05:41.050
At least I did one productive thing today.

05:41.110 --> 05:43.040
Why don't you let me do your bullet points?

05:43.130 --> 05:44.750
I'm doing those.I've already done them,actually.

05:44.830 --> 05:47.300
And I have to do all of this myself.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.600
That's the whole idea.

05:48.650 --> 05:51.410
Oh,I thought the idea was to help families with sick children.

05:51.510 --> 05:53.260
That's not...

05:54.280 --> 05:55.160
what is it?

05:55.240 --> 05:56.520
Not enjoying your retiment?

05:56.600 --> 05:58.410
I am.I'm enjoying it perfectly.

05:58.410 --> 06:01.240
I enjoyed my walk today,a cup of coffee.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.730
I enjoyed reading the newspaper.

06:02.790 --> 06:06.600
Saul,you have all of this fabulous time now.

06:06.690 --> 06:08.950
You have to figure out what you want to do with it.

06:09.050 --> 06:11.270
Be creative.Set a new goal.

06:11.310 --> 06:12.800
Okay.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.520
I'll take a nap.

06:15.670 --> 06:17.150
saul.

06:17.230 --> 06:19.140
Sea new goal.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.410
Okay,you have to stop harassing me.

06:22.490 --> 06:25.330
I-I just want to know if you've given robert's offer any more thought?

06:25.430 --> 06:30.050
Haven't had a single thought about being a republican senator's communication's director.

06:30.130 --> 06:31.170
Kev,look.

06:31.270 --> 06:35.790
I don't want to say yes to my publisher til robert has my replacement,and he only has eyes for you.

06:35.860 --> 06:36.930
Yeah,well,too bad.I'm taken.

06:37.010 --> 06:40.310
This is an operational history of,uh,dart oil dating back to '04.

06:40.370 --> 06:43.390
Do you really want to be defending oil companies for the rest of your life?

06:43.470 --> 06:44.810
I sometimes destroy them.

06:44.910 --> 06:45.990
It just depends on the case.

06:46.090 --> 06:49.920
Well,what you're doing is worse than any drilling law robert ever supported-- just fyi.

06:49.980 --> 06:51.070
I'm gotta go.Bye.

06:51.190 --> 06:52.960
Walker,just the person I'm looking for.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.610
The partners are having a cocktail party after work tomorrow.

06:55.690 --> 06:57.360
You should join us.

06:57.430 --> 06:58.910
I'd love to.Thank you.

06:58.990 --> 07:00.560
Okay.

07:04.340 --> 07:05.350
What?

07:05.430 --> 07:07.510
What do you mean,what?You just got the nod.

07:07.610 --> 07:08.790
Wh--you don't know that.

07:08.890 --> 07:10.390
Please don't be self-effacing.

07:10.470 --> 07:11.380
I hate humility.

07:11.460 --> 07:12.610
It disgusts me.

07:12.670 --> 07:15.850
Just be happy you won.It's the american way.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.160
Okay.We'll see.

07:34.980 --> 07:35.840
We're so glad you're here.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.030
Nice to see you again.And you.

07:37.110 --> 07:39.170
Hi again.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.090
Kevin's gotta get to work.He's gonna join us for dinner.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.400
Right.Oh,you guys have picked a great spot.

07:44.440 --> 07:47.510
Although we actually thought maybe we could eat a little later,

07:47.590 --> 07:49.070
uh,you know,spot some movie stars.

07:49.150 --> 07:50.540
Uh,kevin has a work function.

07:50.590 --> 07:52.790
He's gonna be made partner,which is an amazing thing.

07:52.850 --> 07:54.080
Well.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.600
How much later are we talking?

07:55.680 --> 07:56.790
Uh,9:00?

07:56.870 --> 07:58.980
That is later.

07:59.060 --> 08:02.370
xxxx

08:02.450 --> 08:04.370
It's a little early for a drink.

08:04.430 --> 08:05.650
it's just for the hotel.

08:05.730 --> 08:07.200
I'm more of a bourbon man,but,uh,thanks.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.660
Yeah,I-I know.It's,uh,it's just a great blended scotch.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.100
You know,they--they sign and number every box.

08:13.180 --> 08:14.700
But,uh,I-I think you'll love it.

08:14.780 --> 08:17.980
Uh,mom,kevin got something for you,too.

08:18.060 --> 08:19.810
The picture.

08:19.930 --> 08:22.860
Scotty said,uh,you might like a signed photo of,

08:22.940 --> 08:25.760
uh,kitty,my--my sister,and senator mccallister.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.040
Scotty,that is so sweet.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.030
Yes,it is.

08:28.110 --> 08:29.600
Um,so I've arranged that.

08:29.680 --> 08:35.820
Uh,but it's-- it's not here now because it's gonna be hand-delivered by the subjects themselves.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.650
You mean we can meet the mccallisters?

08:37.730 --> 08:39.400
Yeah,they're gonna join us for dinner.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.110
That was another reason we had to change the time.

08:41.190 --> 08:43.380
Oh,that certainly is worth the wait then.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.750
We'll have a late lunch.

08:44.830 --> 08:46.030
Great.Great.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.660
Okay,I better get to work,uh,if I'm gonna make this promotion.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.250
Uh,what are you guys gonna do today?

08:50.330 --> 08:51.690
Uh,grauman's chinese theatre.The la brea tar pits.

08:51.770 --> 08:53.710
Your father is dying to see the dinosaur remains.

08:53.790 --> 08:57.320
Bea,it's a woolly mammoth.It's different.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.550
GreaT.Well...right.

08:58.630 --> 08:59.850
I'm sure you'll have a great day.

08:59.910 --> 09:01.980
Uh,and I'll see you at dinner.

09:04.890 --> 09:06.240
Bye.

09:07.670 --> 09:12.760
this house will provide temporary lodging for the families of seriously ill children

09:12.840 --> 09:16.860
who are being treated at nearby medical facilities.

09:18.040 --> 09:26.450
the staff will include nurses,therapists,tutors,housekeepers,cooks and other specialists.

09:26.530 --> 09:28.040
Now for the money part.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.950
That's where you come in.

09:30.010 --> 09:34.560
We estimate that the building itself will cost approximately $3 million.

09:34.640 --> 09:40.000
Add on to that the cost of renovation,medical supplies,furnishings--

09:40.080 --> 09:42.870
you're asking for a lot of money,miss,um...

09:42.950 --> 09:44.050
walker.

09:44.150 --> 09:50.550
And while I'm not questioning the need for something like this,we mostly try to fund research.

09:50.610 --> 09:52.620
What kind of experience do you have?

09:52.700 --> 09:54.830
I don't see a r閟um?here.

09:54.900 --> 09:57.110
I-I-I really don't have a r閟um?

09:57.210 --> 10:00.520
per se,but I have lots and lots of experience.

10:00.580 --> 10:04.940
I watched my husband,william walker,build his company from the ground up.

10:05.020 --> 10:08.700
And I was with him every single step-- I used to know william walker.

10:08.780 --> 10:09.970
Oh,really?

10:10.030 --> 10:11.720
Ojai foods,right? -Yes.

10:11.780 --> 10:13.150
How--how is he?

10:13.230 --> 10:14.380
Dead.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.490
Dead.He died a few years ago.

10:16.550 --> 10:18.280
Oh,god.I'm--I'M...

10:18.350 --> 10:20.050
I'm sorry.

10:20.130 --> 10:21.340
How are you doing?

10:21.420 --> 10:22.460
Fine.Oh,fine.

10:22.520 --> 10:27.820
I'm--I'm here trying to raise money for the families of seriously ill children.

10:27.900 --> 10:28.980
You know what?

10:29.050 --> 10:33.850
I think mr.Goldschmidt could find time to meet with william walker's wife.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.250
Uh,he's hoping to decide on these grants in the next few days.

10:38.070 --> 10:43.440
Well,whatever's good for mr.Goldschmidt,I-- is fine with me.

10:45.890 --> 10:46.940
Stop it,cooper.

10:47.890 --> 10:48.860
I cannot concentrate!

10:48.940 --> 10:50.240
cooper,stop kicking the ball.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.750
And,paige,stop yelling.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.970
Cooper,I mean it.Knock it off.Take the ball outside before you break something.

10:55.070 --> 10:56.730
Fine. -One,two...

10:56.790 --> 10:57.920
mom,I'm hungry.

10:57.980 --> 11:00.140
Get some sandwich stuff out,honey.I'll

11:02.810 --> 11:03.640
What is this?

11:03.720 --> 11:04.790
Paige,I am on the phone.

11:04.910 --> 11:06.610
Sarah,thank god you're there.I need your help.

11:06.670 --> 11:09.460
Mom,I really don't have time to deal with a family crisis right now.

11:09.540 --> 11:12.860
I am stuck in my own "supernanny" episode,minus the supernanny.

11:12.940 --> 11:15.050
No,no.This is not about the family.

11:15.130 --> 11:17.190
This is about work.

11:17.270 --> 11:19.900
I need your help with my grant presentation.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.690
I can't help you---

11:22.520 --> 11:24.700
oops.I'm sorry,mom!

11:24.760 --> 11:25.690
What was that?

11:25.770 --> 11:26.820
Uh,nothing.

11:26.870 --> 11:28.260
Kitty,I am begging you.

11:28.340 --> 11:29.320
This is an emergency.

11:29.410 --> 11:33.430
Look,I have to get to my publisher,and robe has a very early meeting in the morning.

11:33.530 --> 11:35.770
Scotty's parents have driven all the way from arizona.

11:35.870 --> 11:37.710
For you and robert to be there-- it would be like

11:37.790 --> 11:41.500
when the chinese sent those pandas to nixon for the goodwill trip.

11:41.580 --> 11:43.080
Oh,I do love those pandas.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.290
Right,so pretty please,with bamboo on top.

11:45.370 --> 11:46.770
Fine.I'll talk to robert.

11:46.810 --> 11:49.890
And one more thing-- can you guys bring an autographed picture of yourselves?

11:49.970 --> 11:53.010
God!Okay,kevin,but if you ask me for one more favor,

11:53.070 --> 11:55.240
you're gonna have to say yes to robert's job offer.

11:55.310 --> 11:57.930
No chance.But I do love you.Thank you.Bye.

12:00.650 --> 12:02.030
Hope you got something for me.

12:02.110 --> 12:04.010
I am not cut out to be a stay-at-home mom.

12:04.070 --> 12:05.370
I think you'll be pleased.

12:05.430 --> 12:10.180
Great,'cause just being in a real office with an actual grown-up's like the highlight of my week.

12:10.260 --> 12:14.080
What happened to,uh,wanting a minimal commute and flexible working hours?

12:14.140 --> 12:16.580
Well,I am open to travel.What is it?

12:16.640 --> 12:18.080
I think you're gonna be very pleased.

12:19.090 --> 12:20.700
Diamond canyon.

12:20.780 --> 12:22.700
It's a bottled water company. -Okay.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.230
Uh,you'll be regional director...

12:24.310 --> 12:25.900
Of performance and quality improvement.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.710
That's a little vague.

12:28.420 --> 12:30.670
Is this the salary for the quarter?

12:31.440 --> 12:32.760
The year.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.670
You can't be serious.

12:35.230 --> 12:36.510
Really?

12:36.610 --> 12:38.790
Look,in this job market...

12:38.870 --> 12:40.550
you've been unemployed nearly a month.

12:40.610 --> 12:44.850
No,I know it's not the optimum time to be looking for a job,

12:44.950 --> 12:47.040
but I mean,this is half of what I was earning at ojai.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.180
Sarah,'ve got five clients who are perfect for this.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.140
If you want to take the weekend to think it over,fine.

12:53.220 --> 12:55.450
But then I'm gonna go down the list.

12:56.730 --> 12:58.410
Great.Thanks.

13:03.490 --> 13:04.700
There you arE.

13:04.830 --> 13:06.270
I've been looking all over for you.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.880
I was just,uh,I was dropping off my time card.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.260
Great.I'm heading out.

13:10.340 --> 13:13.410
Could you call marco to confirm the vineyard tours for next month?

13:13.490 --> 13:14.780
Yeah,sure.

13:15.070 --> 13:17.130
Hey,guys.Uh,sorry.A little problem.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.180
I just realized I'm not gonna be able to go to the vineyard with you today.

13:20.260 --> 13:22.280
I have a long-standing dinner with saul.

13:22.380 --> 13:25.570
Tommy,that meeting has been on the books for weeks.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.450
I-I don't want to make a design decision without a second opinion.

13:28.530 --> 13:30.040
Yeah,but rebecca can go with you.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.170
She's got a great eye.

13:31.230 --> 13:34.590
Yeah,I'm sure she'd really appreciate you pawning your work off on her.

13:34.670 --> 13:36.310
No,you know,actually,I-I wouldn't mind.

13:36.410 --> 13:37.760
I mean,if you don't mind.

13:37.850 --> 13:38.790
See?

13:38.870 --> 13:40.090
Problem solved.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.960
Thank you.Bye.

13:42.670 --> 13:44.140
That's a surprise.

13:44.220 --> 13:45.350
Why?It sounds interesting.

13:45.350 --> 13:49.370
You--you really don't mind driving up to walker landing with me?

13:49.450 --> 13:51.590
No,I mean,we could spend some time together,catch up.

13:51.690 --> 13:52.950
It sounds nice.

13:53.030 --> 13:53.960
I'd love to.

13:54.020 --> 13:55.850
All right,cool.I'll get my stuff.

14:00.690 --> 14:02.720
Paige and coop are doing a puzzle.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.330
-Together? -Yes.

14:04.390 --> 14:05.860
No fighting?No broken windows?

14:05.950 --> 14:08.000
-No. -Oh,my god.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.270
I'm their grandmother.It's easieR.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.590
Yeah,we could swap,you know?

14:11.680 --> 14:13.320
I get the grant,you get the kids.

14:13.410 --> 14:15.970
I've been making that deal my whole life.I'll pass.

14:16.060 --> 14:18.950
And,you know,you could have a job next week if you wanted it.

14:19.010 --> 14:23.590
Given the state of my kitchen window,I might have to take one.Thank you.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.770
Seriously,mom,how did you do it?

14:26.830 --> 14:28.660
-What? -Us.

14:28.740 --> 14:32.870
You had five kids running in different directions,nonstop bickering.

14:32.950 --> 14:35.330
How did you not go completely insane?

14:35.410 --> 14:36.430
I did.

14:36.530 --> 14:38.910
I went completely and utterly insane.

14:38.990 --> 14:40.620
And then...

14:40.720 --> 14:42.280
and then one of you would do something,

14:42.360 --> 14:47.400
like whistle for the first time or make a see-through umbrella out of saran wrap.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.000
-That was me. -Yes,that was you.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.680
I loved that umbrella.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.300
You just have to stay...

14:52.380 --> 14:54.320
open to the moments.

14:54.650 --> 14:57.450
But,sarah,you're not wrong for wanting to go back to work.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.920
I mean,look where I'm at now.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.430
This grant is great.

15:01.490 --> 15:03.960
Yeah,the pie chart is glorious.Big whoop.

15:04.020 --> 15:06.280
All those board members saw was just this--

15:06.340 --> 15:08.870
this housewife standing there with no experience.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.960
They had--they had "no" written all over their foreheads.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.160
It can't have been that bad.

15:13.250 --> 15:16.540
You've got another meeting with mr.Goldschmidt tonight?

15:16.600 --> 15:18.420
Yeah,it's a pity meeting,you know?

15:18.500 --> 15:20.430
And--and it's not even a meeting.

15:20.510 --> 15:21.700
It's just drinks.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.890
And that wouldn't even be happening if I hadn't mentioned your father.

15:24.940 --> 15:27.150
Oh,I have no experience.

15:27.230 --> 15:30.040
Mom,you're letting these people intimidate you.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.710
It's--it's a confidence game.

15:31.810 --> 15:34.980
Just go and talk to them like they're wallace.

15:35.250 --> 15:36.270
The butcher?

15:36.350 --> 15:38.390
I've seen you march right up to that counter.

15:38.470 --> 15:39.950
You're direct,you know what you want,

15:40.050 --> 15:43.060
and u never accept anything less than the best cut.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.060
okay.

15:45.140 --> 15:46.490
Okay.

15:48.520 --> 15:51.000
I've gotta say,youre a natural.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.510
You have a great eye.

15:52.580 --> 15:53.870
Oh,it was beginner's luck.

15:53.970 --> 15:55.880
No,don't diminish yourself.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.490
They were impressed.

15:57.570 --> 15:58.870
I was impressed.

15:58.950 --> 15:59.980
Well,it was fun.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.000
Yeah,we have to do this more often.

16:02.080 --> 16:05.450
It was so nice having you here with me,

16:05.510 --> 16:08.640
especially after everything that's happened.

16:09.090 --> 16:11.450
No,this whole ryan thing is crazy,isn't it?

16:11.490 --> 16:15.240
Uh,n-no,I-I mean with saul and sarah quitting.

16:15.320 --> 16:16.400
But I mean,no...

16:16.460 --> 16:17.700
You're--you're right.

16:17.780 --> 16:20.200
I didn't see that coming either.

16:20.930 --> 16:23.170
Are--are you-- are you okay about it?

16:24.080 --> 16:26.010
Yeah,I'm fine.

16:26.510 --> 16:29.630
I mean,at first,I was really shocked.

16:29.710 --> 16:33.150
I couldn't believe that william would keep something like that from me.

16:33.210 --> 16:36.830
Which I know sounds crazy,since he was keeping me from nora.

16:36.910 --> 16:38.470
No,no,that doesn't sound crazy.

16:38.550 --> 16:41.550
I mean,I don't know how I would feel if I was in your shoes,so...

16:42.410 --> 16:44.190
actually...

16:44.270 --> 16:47.160
I thought about finding him.

16:47.360 --> 16:50.440
I even went so far as to look him up.

16:50.490 --> 16:52.470
He lives in bakersfield.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.070
Have you met him?

16:56.150 --> 16:57.880
No,no.I just...

16:57.940 --> 17:02.460
I got all the information,and then I just stuck it in a file.

17:03.060 --> 17:05.000
So--so what are you gonna do with it?

17:05.079 --> 17:06.210
Nothing.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.520
I think I just.

17:07.579 --> 17:10.609
I just had to feel like I was in control.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.480
Are you mad at me?

17:14.560 --> 17:15.730
No.

17:15.790 --> 17:19.490
No,no.I'm actually really just happy that you told me.

17:19.859 --> 17:22.390
Well,you said you wanted me to be honest.

17:25.970 --> 17:28.339
would it be completely out of line if the temp suggests

17:28.430 --> 17:31.590
that maybe we crack a bottle for happy hour?

17:32.180 --> 17:37.490
no,not at all,especially since the temp happens to be my daughter.

17:42.130 --> 17:47.210
I don't set an alarm,and I still can't sleep past 6:00 A.M.

17:47.740 --> 17:49.740
I mean,I'm gonna be 70,tommy.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.750
I don't--I don't know why I find retirement so strange.

17:51.830 --> 17:52.700
I knew it.

17:52.770 --> 17:54.270
-What? -You miss the action.

17:54.330 --> 17:55.680
-no,i don'T. -Yes,you do.

17:55.740 --> 17:57.470
No.Little bit?

17:57.550 --> 17:58.670
Maybe a little.

17:58.750 --> 18:01.690
Yeah,well,anytime you want to return to your stomping grounds,

18:01.770 --> 18:04.160
we could never find a better C.F.O.

18:04.660 --> 18:06.170
So how's julia?

18:06.390 --> 18:07.380
She's better.

18:07.460 --> 18:11.350
You know,I mean,uh,elizabeth is a lot of work.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.040
What about holly?How's all that going?

18:14.100 --> 18:15.690
Not a conflict to speak of.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.620
Oh,come on,tommy.I find that hard to believe.

18:17.620 --> 18:21.320
None of you understand that she's actually a decent partner.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.780
She wants the company to be a success,

18:23.860 --> 18:26.440
and she carries her share of the workload,so...

18:26.520 --> 18:28.280
I'm so happy that everything's going so well.

18:28.340 --> 18:29.720
Let me fill your glass for you.

18:29.780 --> 18:31.130
Okay.

18:32.010 --> 18:33.240
So...

18:33.340 --> 18:34.950
you and justin.

18:36.010 --> 18:38.150
Come on.We opened a bottle of wine.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.020
Let's put it to good use.

18:40.460 --> 18:42.150
Is it serious?

18:42.470 --> 18:44.210
Yeah,I think so.

18:44.330 --> 18:45.980
I mean,we hang out all the time.

18:46.060 --> 18:48.660
We...have so much fun together.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.450
I'm sensing a "but.

18:52.570 --> 18:54.560
" No,it--it's just that...

18:54.620 --> 18:56.200
he can be really closed off.

18:56.280 --> 18:57.210
But he's getting better.

18:57.270 --> 19:01.230
I mean,he's opening up a lot about iraq,which is hard for him.

19:01.310 --> 19:02.990
And how's the sex?

19:03.090 --> 19:04.450
Mom?

19:04.550 --> 19:07.390
it's obvious that there's something going on.

19:07.490 --> 19:08.940
There's no sex happening.

19:09.020 --> 19:10.560
That's what's going on.

19:13.970 --> 19:16.100
Is that a mutual decision?

19:17.400 --> 19:22.110
I mean,at first it was,but now I think it's more me.

19:22.210 --> 19:27.670
Well,with all the stuff that you have been through with the paternity and my affairs,

19:27.750 --> 19:30.340
it's no wonder that you're a little tentative.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.670
You make us seem so messed up.

19:32.760 --> 19:33.760
no,no.

19:33.820 --> 19:35.680
You're not messed up.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.540
I mean,look who you've chosen.

19:38.600 --> 19:43.630
I never had a boyfriend that was nice and kind and available.

19:43.730 --> 19:46.180
I mean,no one that I ever really liked.

19:46.900 --> 19:49.120
But,rebecca,you're not like me.

19:49.220 --> 19:50.860
Thank god.

19:53.790 --> 19:54.950
where did you go?

19:55.010 --> 19:56.370
the wax museum.

19:56.450 --> 19:59.480
When we passed in front of liberace,none of us said a word.

19:59.540 --> 20:00.630
Where are you now?

20:00.710 --> 20:03.480
You know that red double-decker bus that goes up and down hollywood boulevard?

20:03.570 --> 20:05.060
Oh,my god.

20:05.140 --> 20:06.420
You should see my parents.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.090
They're practically hanging off the side of the bus to get a good picture of

20:09.150 --> 20:11.660
the pirate in front of grauman's chinese theatre.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.320
You know what?They're having fun.You're bonding.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.290
Look,I gotta go.My destiny awaits.

20:15.370 --> 20:18.490
I can't wait to celebrate and get off this bus.

20:18.590 --> 20:20.110
Bye.

20:31.700 --> 20:34.030
kevin,it's good to see you.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.930
Listen,I want to give you a heads-up.

20:36.010 --> 20:39.180
I really think you deserve to be partner.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.760
It's been a long haul.

20:40.820 --> 20:43.780
It certainly has,but,uh,this makes it all worth it.

20:44.650 --> 20:46.070
Yeah,that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

20:46.150 --> 20:49.350
I,uh,I was outvoted at the partners' meeting.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.240
I did what I could.I honestly thought that you were a lock,but there was someone else

20:53.320 --> 20:55.580
that they were more interested in this year.

20:55.660 --> 20:59.070
Now it doesn't mean that you won't be considered in the future.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.450
Okay?

21:12.660 --> 21:14.180
Another bourbon on the rocks for you.

21:14.230 --> 21:20.070
No,but a driven bird coming at you is so much harder to get than one going away,like a quail.

21:20.130 --> 21:22.350
Well,I learned to shoot quail as a young boy,senator.

21:22.380 --> 21:23.790
Oh,well,then you know.

21:23.850 --> 21:27.690
There's just nothing better-- companionship,a good dog,a fine gun.

21:27.750 --> 21:30.910
Scotty used to pan fry them with gravy on the side,right?

21:31.010 --> 21:34.700
I don't remember the whole quail thing.

21:36.610 --> 21:38.570
Uh,do you cook,kitty?

21:38.780 --> 21:40.770
Uh,well,not quail.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.940
Well,and not like scotty.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.260
oh,look who's here.

21:48.330 --> 21:50.080
Here is your champagne.

21:50.110 --> 21:51.260
Thank you.

21:51.340 --> 21:53.390
So are you going to sit down,big shot,

21:53.480 --> 21:54.790
or are you too important fous now?

21:54.870 --> 21:56.020
Ohshut up.

21:56.100 --> 21:57.380
Did they give you the corner office?

21:57.440 --> 21:58.280
Not yet.

21:58.340 --> 22:00.480
Okay,well,here's a toast to my brother kevin.

22:01.090 --> 22:02.060
Congratulations.

22:02.140 --> 22:03.380
We're all really proud of you.

22:03.430 --> 22:04.240
Thank you.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.040
Here's hoping you're not involved in any of those frivolous lawsuits.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.150
I think you should listen to your brother-in-law on that particular topic.

22:12.050 --> 22:13.390
you all having a good time?

22:13.640 --> 22:16.200
Well,I was looking forward to sitting out on the patio.

22:18.020 --> 22:19.620
You know,I'm so sorry.

22:19.710 --> 22:20.840
The reservation got changed so many times-- you know what?

22:20.910 --> 22:23.630
I think this table is perfect.

22:23.740 --> 22:25.440
I-I think this is a good table.

22:25.530 --> 22:26.710
You do?

22:26.780 --> 22:28.680
It is a good table,I guess.

22:29.420 --> 22:31.190
Did you like the picture?

22:31.290 --> 22:34.750
Oh,yes.K-kitty,tell us more about the adoption.

22:34.810 --> 22:35.760
They loved it.

22:35.850 --> 22:37.600
I think that baby is going to be so lucky.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.960
I can't think of a better couple to raise a child.

22:40.030 --> 22:42.400
We--we actually think of ourselves as lucky.

22:42.580 --> 22:45.270
Well,we both admire you so much.

22:45.340 --> 22:47.070
We wanted to vote for you for president,but...

22:47.150 --> 22:50.330
scotty.I think I'm gonna have the lemon garlic prawns.

22:50.390 --> 22:51.980
Can I have a word with you?

22:54.970 --> 22:56.340
what?

23:00.400 --> 23:03.370
So I'm on the fourth hole at riviera--

23:03.450 --> 23:05.890
hogan's hole-- best par-3 in golf.

23:05.970 --> 23:07.310
I don't know it.

23:07.390 --> 23:08.390
Your husband did.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.230
He never made par there,though.

23:10.470 --> 23:14.880
You know,I enjoy an afternoon of golf as much as anyone,

23:14.960 --> 23:17.830
but I would really love it if we could get back to my proposal.

23:17.900 --> 23:18.680
Sorry.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.440
I get a little arried away when talking golf.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.290
You know,that's how I feel about this home.

23:23.350 --> 23:26.180
When--when people like us get sick,god forbid,

23:26.240 --> 23:30.790
we know that we can have our families around us because we have the resources to make that happen.

23:30.850 --> 23:32.880
But a lot of people who come here for medical care,

23:32.950 --> 23:37.140
they can't afford to put themselves up,especially when the cost of treatment is so exorbitant.

23:37.200 --> 23:41.120
Nora,this is a big enterprise you're proposing.

23:41.200 --> 23:45.330
And frankly,I'm a little nervous given your lack of experience.

23:45.410 --> 23:46.900
Yes.

23:47.470 --> 23:50.670
Yes,I know I have never run a business.

23:51.540 --> 23:54.290
But let me tell you,mr.Goldschmidt,

23:54.360 --> 23:56.650
I have run a household of seven.

23:56.710 --> 23:59.590
I know it's an unpaid and unappreciated position,

23:59.650 --> 24:04.540
but I defy you or any of your people I spoke with this morning to do

24:04.580 --> 24:07.700
what I did for the past 40 some odd years.

24:07.760 --> 24:12.680
I organized the schedules of five extremely well-rounded children.

24:12.740 --> 24:16.010
I ran carpools and bake sales and bluebird groups.

24:16.100 --> 24:19.430
I negotiated and mandated and coddled all at the same time,

24:19.490 --> 24:23.280
not to mention what I had to do for my husband to keep him happy and productive.

24:23.340 --> 24:26.300
And I did all of this without ever taking a sick day.

24:26.340 --> 24:30.340
The problem is no one values the experience of a stay-at-home parent,

24:30.410 --> 24:34.950
which is truly a shame,because basically,running this big enterprise,

24:35.030 --> 24:37.620
as you put it,would be a day at the beach for me.

24:38.130 --> 24:40.250
I'm sorry I got so carried away.

24:40.590 --> 24:42.260
Nora,wait.

24:43.230 --> 24:44.870
Come on.Sit down.

24:45.320 --> 24:46.930
Is this gonna be about golf?

24:47.010 --> 24:48.670
No,no golf.

24:48.740 --> 24:52.290
I'm not saying our working relationship is unmanageable,

24:52.330 --> 24:55.250
but--but how do I forget the way she came into the company?

24:55.310 --> 24:57.050
You know another thing is-- is rebecca.

24:57.110 --> 24:58.020
She's sweet.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.600
I love her like a sister-turned-not-sister and now my brother's girlfriend,

25:01.680 --> 25:07.910
and she does a great job,but it just-- it feels like their family business.

25:08.360 --> 25:10.000
I don't know,saul.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.170
About what?

25:11.230 --> 25:12.540
All of it.

25:13.230 --> 25:14.910
What are you,my shrink?

25:16.540 --> 25:18.070
I'm your uncle.

25:19.620 --> 25:25.400
I just want you to know that if there ever comes a time when you wantolly gone,I...

25:25.780 --> 25:27.460
you gonna rub her out?

25:27.560 --> 25:29.390
she's a co-owner.

25:29.470 --> 25:31.700
Sarah would come back in a second.

25:33.140 --> 25:34.590
What--what are you talking about?

25:34.640 --> 25:37.020
If getting rid of holly becomes a goal of yours,

25:37.080 --> 25:39.320
I want you to know that I would make it mine,too.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.820
That's all.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.230
told you that I would find the perfect moment,

25:47.300 --> 25:49.560
and guess what-- moment found.

25:52.780 --> 25:53.950
What,are you drunk?

25:54.010 --> 25:55.430
No,I'm not drunk.

25:55.740 --> 25:57.700
We were at a vineyard.I had a little wine.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.660
My mother was the designated driver.

25:59.720 --> 26:00.960
So she got you drunk?

26:01.040 --> 26:02.020
No,she didn't get me drunk.

26:02.100 --> 26:07.620
I suggested we open a bottle of wine after she totally confessed,unprompted.

26:07.980 --> 26:10.470
So what did she say?What is she gonna do?

26:10.550 --> 26:11.940
Nothing.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.400
She was just...

26:13.490 --> 26:18.020
confused and curious and wanted to feel in control.That's it.

26:18.080 --> 26:20.480
And you believe her?

26:21.280 --> 26:22.780
Justin,it was great.We talked for hours.

26:22.780 --> 26:26.130
I just--I don't see a reason for her to lie to me.

26:26.190 --> 26:28.220
It's never stopped her before.

26:29.700 --> 26:32.750
I'm sorry,but I think you're forgetting that the only reason

26:32.810 --> 26:36.190
why my mom actually knows about ryan is because your mother wanted to rub it in her face.

26:36.250 --> 26:38.410
Oh,like she wouldn't have found out anyway?

26:39.240 --> 26:40.510
Look,I'm--I'm--I'm sorry.

26:40.590 --> 26:42.540
I'm just having a tough time realizing how you go from "uh-oh,

26:42.620 --> 26:45.890
my psycho mom is on to something" to "uh,I believe everything she says.

26:45.970 --> 26:46.970
She's a changed woman.

26:47.040 --> 26:47.800
" You know what?Screw you.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.310
Why can't you just see her for what she is?

26:49.370 --> 26:50.440
What,do you have a blind spot?

26:50.510 --> 26:51.650
What are you saying,that I'm just like my mother?

26:51.720 --> 26:52.580
Because I'm not. -I never said that.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.610
Guess what.Your father--not exactly the perfect role model.

26:54.670 --> 26:55.910
What,are you comparing me to my father?

26:55.970 --> 26:57.120
Like what--why are you even with me then?

26:57.180 --> 26:58.690
-Because. -Why?

26:58.750 --> 26:59.670
You know what?Just get out.

26:59.740 --> 27:00.610
Rebecca-- get out.

27:00.670 --> 27:01.400
What do you think I'm gonna do,cheat on you?

27:01.400 --> 27:02.100
Is that it,you think I'm gonna cheat with you?

27:02.100 --> 27:04.060
Justin,I don't want to do this right now.This is my apartment.Leave.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.260
No,I asked you a question.

27:05.330 --> 27:06.210
Just get out!

27:06.290 --> 27:08.010
I'm not gonna leave you.

27:25.470 --> 27:29.540
I think it is wonderful you're having a baby at this point in your life.

27:29.620 --> 27:31.870
I had scotty at such a young age.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.320
Have you ever thought about adopting?

27:35.390 --> 27:38.250
Oh,maybe someday,but not right now.

27:38.310 --> 27:39.480
That's probably smart.

27:39.590 --> 27:40.530
no,no,no.

27:40.610 --> 27:43.910
I-I think that they would make amazing parents,even if they are democrats.

27:45.130 --> 27:49.160
speaking of which,can we tell you how much we enjoyed your tv show "red,white & blue"?

27:49.220 --> 27:51.820
So what was it like,interviewing all those famous types?

27:51.910 --> 27:53.320
That's actually how we met.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.400
oh,how romantic.

27:55.480 --> 27:59.230
Actually,we were told that we might meet some famous people ourselves,

27:59.290 --> 28:01.850
except I think they're all sitting out on the patio.

28:01.900 --> 28:03.980
You know what,bertha?I think that's enough.

28:05.520 --> 28:06.490
Excuse me?

28:06.570 --> 28:09.740
I'm sorry.I thought we came here to break the ice and to get to know each other,

28:09.780 --> 28:10.940
but I feel like I'm not even here.

28:11.010 --> 28:11.920
Kevin-- what?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.990
Can we please stop pretending that everything's fine and have a real conversation?

28:15.070 --> 28:16.340
I thought we were having one.

28:16.420 --> 28:19.290
No,no,that would require you to be a little less passive-aggressive.

28:19.350 --> 28:22.990
You can fawn over my sister and her husband because they're in your pantheon of republican gods,

28:23.070 --> 28:26.100
you can honor their version of the alternative family,but you know what?

28:26.160 --> 28:29.830
Maybe I'm not smart,but someday,maybe we would like to adopt.

28:29.910 --> 28:32.500
We drove here all the way from arizona.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.410
Okay,why don't we all just take a deep breath?

28:35.490 --> 28:36.900
I can breathe just fine.Thank you.

28:36.900 --> 28:39.450
You should hear him on a night when he doesn't make partner.

28:39.510 --> 28:42.900
Actually,I turned them down,'cause I'm so sick of being a lawyer.

28:42.960 --> 28:43.840
What do you-- what do you mean?

28:43.900 --> 28:44.720
Well,I have options.

28:44.790 --> 28:46.160
You see your two heroes here?

28:46.220 --> 28:48.120
They offered me a job.And guess what.Surprise,surprise.

28:48.180 --> 28:50.530
Your gay,democrat son-in-law is gonna take it.

28:50.770 --> 28:52.080
You're going to work for him?

28:52.140 --> 28:53.860
Try to be a little less enthusiastic.

28:53.920 --> 28:58.300
Yes,I am,because someone has to cross the aisle,or nothing gets done.

28:58.770 --> 29:00.290
I'm not hungry anymore.

29:00.350 --> 29:01.760
I want to go to the hotel.

29:01.840 --> 29:06.090
Mo-- I'm sorry.

29:06.150 --> 29:08.710
It was really a pleasure to meet you.

29:09.170 --> 29:11.290
What hotel did you put them up in?

29:11.850 --> 29:13.180
oh,my god.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.180
You forgot.

29:14.250 --> 29:15.400
I'm-- great.

29:15.460 --> 29:16.400
Scotty.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.880
Scotty.

29:22.580 --> 29:23.430
Hi,mom.

29:23.510 --> 29:25.230
Sarah,I didn't hold back.

29:25.310 --> 29:27.860
I-I practically lectured him,and guess what.

29:28.370 --> 29:31.070
Mr.Goldschmidt gave me a grant.

29:31.150 --> 29:33.460
Mom,that's fantastic!

29:33.910 --> 29:35.670
You were so right.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.840
I just needed a little confidence.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.150
You sound so happy.

29:39.220 --> 29:40.440
I'm almost jealous.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.450
Come to work for me.

29:41.530 --> 29:42.630
I'm serious.

29:42.710 --> 29:43.510
What's the pay?

29:43.570 --> 29:45.300
Nothing.It's a volunteer position.

29:45.360 --> 29:46.600
But maybe someday.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.180
Oh,sarah!

29:48.230 --> 29:51.370
It felt so good to be taken seriously.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.150
mama!Mama!

29:53.210 --> 29:54.380
Okay,mom,I gotta go.

29:54.440 --> 29:55.890
Congrats.

29:56.440 --> 29:58.620
cooper,what is it?

29:58.680 --> 30:01.490
Flashlight down,under the covers now.

30:01.570 --> 30:02.640
Look.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.100
Okay,I am gonna count to three.

30:04.190 --> 30:05.860
I want the flashlight on the bedside table.

30:05.920 --> 30:06.770
One...

30:06.850 --> 30:07.770
look!

30:07.840 --> 30:09.450
Two-- look!

30:10.350 --> 30:11.970
Oh,god.It's a caterpillar.

30:12.030 --> 30:14.310
Yeah,it turns into a butterfly.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.400
Okay,I'll take care of it.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.430
Can I hold it?

30:17.520 --> 30:18.380
No.

30:18.480 --> 30:19.940
Please.

30:21.110 --> 30:22.750
Will you go straight to sleep?

30:23.310 --> 30:24.140
Deal?

30:24.200 --> 30:25.430
Deal.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.700
Okay.

30:26.770 --> 30:29.740
Please get the flashlight out of my eyes.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.490
Put your hands out.

30:35.550 --> 30:37.820
Be very gentle.You don't want to squish him.

30:43.420 --> 30:47.010
Can we stay up until the butterfly comes?

30:47.250 --> 30:49.670
Well,that would be a very long time.

30:49.850 --> 30:51.320
Okay.

31:15.190 --> 31:17.610
so close to you did you find a hotel for your parents?

31:17.690 --> 31:19.170
Motel...

31:19.230 --> 31:20.800
in silver lake.

31:25.380 --> 31:26.780
scotty,I am so sorry.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.270
I asked for one weekend,kevin,one.

31:30.020 --> 31:32.500
Our entire lives are about your family.

31:32.560 --> 31:36.530
My parents visit us for the first time,and you can't show an ounce of restraint?

31:37.250 --> 31:38.790
I know.

31:38.850 --> 31:40.240
What is wrong with you?

31:40.320 --> 31:44.630
I mean,first you-- you introduce yourself by barging into their house on our wedding day,

31:44.710 --> 31:46.750
then you completely flip out at dinner.

31:46.810 --> 31:50.120
And after I put up with your endless work hours,your obsession over making partner,

31:50.180 --> 31:55.620
you blithely announce at dinner you're quitting your job to work for a republican.

31:56.490 --> 31:57.690
Maybe I could do some good.

31:57.770 --> 31:58.640
Have you lost your mind?

31:58.700 --> 32:00.570
I was just trying to get your parents to like me.

32:00.670 --> 32:01.880
Like you?I know.

32:01.940 --> 32:03.070
Now they hate me more than ever.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.880
Well,there's such a thing as cause and effect.

32:04.950 --> 32:05.920
I am so sorry.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.270
If I could take it back,of course I would.

32:07.330 --> 32:08.490
It was a bad day.

32:08.550 --> 32:09.850
Yeah,you can say that again.

32:09.930 --> 32:11.630
I didn't make partner.

32:12.220 --> 32:14.030
They gave it to someone else.

32:14.130 --> 32:17.600
And I couldn't say anything at dinner because I was so humiliated.

32:18.240 --> 32:21.880
This is by no means an excuse,but when I left work,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.940
all I could think of was getting to you because I knew once I'd see you,

32:25.020 --> 32:27.030
I would feel okay,and when I got there,

32:27.090 --> 32:33.420
the only pair of eyes that I wanted to see were yours because all I wanted was a hug.

32:33.990 --> 32:37.640
I don't blame you at all,because we agreed,no P.D.A.

32:39.890 --> 32:44.390
-Come here. -I swear I will make it up to them.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.900
I mean,wow.

32:58.040 --> 33:00.250
I can't believe we waited that long.

33:00.410 --> 33:01.420
We're idiots.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.900
What were we thinking?

33:02.950 --> 33:03.980
We were thinking too much.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.650
That's what we were thinking.

33:05.770 --> 33:07.210
I'm done thinking.

33:07.290 --> 33:08.820
Me,too.

33:09.960 --> 33:13.040
I can't believe we had fight sex before we had real sex.

33:13.140 --> 33:15.220
I think it counts as real sex.

33:16.280 --> 33:19.230
Besides,I have no idea what we were actually fighting about.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.550
That's because it wasn't our fight.

33:22.730 --> 33:24.810
Although you do pack a punch.

33:26.820 --> 33:29.320
I think I know what we need to do.

33:33.730 --> 33:35.090
I have an idea.

33:35.990 --> 33:37.000
Not that.

33:37.080 --> 33:38.400
Not that I don't want to do that,too.

33:38.490 --> 33:40.520
I'm just--I'm talking about our moms.

33:40.830 --> 33:42.290
Well,that's a buzzkill.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.940
I think you should listen to my idea first.

33:52.690 --> 33:55.800
,I,uh,I made some sandwiches for the road.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.200
Oh,there's some banana bread in there,too.

33:57.260 --> 33:58.430
Sounds delicious,honey.

33:58.490 --> 33:59.720
Uh,do you need directions?

33:59.800 --> 34:02.650
No,we've got the gps in the car,but,uh,thanks anyway.

34:04.390 --> 34:05.850
Look,um,I'D...

34:05.930 --> 34:08.170
I'd like to apologize again for the other night.

34:08.230 --> 34:09.989
It was-- water under the bridge.

34:10.050 --> 34:11.679
We're sorry you didn't make partner.

34:11.719 --> 34:13.190
Thank you.

34:13.560 --> 34:15.550
This is for you.

34:15.949 --> 34:19.469
It's a bottle of bourbon,whicis what I should've got you in the first place.

34:19.500 --> 34:21.900
You're determined to get me drunk,aren't you?

34:21.960 --> 34:24.219
Well,I appreciate this,but I'll tell you what--

34:24.460 --> 34:27.969
why don't I take the scotch back with me,you take this,

34:28.050 --> 34:31.139
and in a few months,maybe we'll,uh,compare notes?

34:32.120 --> 34:33.750
I'd be very glad to.

34:34.040 --> 34:37.179
Someone's gonna have to cross the aisle,or nothing's gonna get done.

34:40.710 --> 34:42.449
well,we-- we better get going.

34:53.230 --> 34:55.250
I'm gonna let you go down that list.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.660
Offer the position to one of your other clients.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.880
I'm a little surprised.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.380
Kids stop driving you crazy?

35:00.750 --> 35:02.550
No,never.

35:02.710 --> 35:04.140
But,you know...

35:05.090 --> 35:06.490
no.

35:06.770 --> 35:10.320
Look,it's a decent position,and god knows,I'm gonna need a job.

35:10.330 --> 35:13.590
But right now,hanging out with my kids is pretty cool,

35:13.670 --> 35:18.220
and if I'm gonna give that up,it can't be for something that's just decent.

35:18.280 --> 35:19.900
Find me something...

35:19.980 --> 35:22.600
better,something great.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.980
And,uh,then we'll talk.

35:34.920 --> 35:36.690
what,you don't lock the door anymore?

35:36.750 --> 35:38.240
What happened to the secret service?

35:38.320 --> 35:40.040
I'm not running for president anymore.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.900
Nobodyares if you shoot me.

35:42.420 --> 35:43.970
Hello to you,toO.

35:44.030 --> 35:46.410
Honey,did you,um,happen to make another...

35:46.510 --> 35:48.420
oh,we have company.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.010
Hey.

35:50.540 --> 35:52.070
How are you doing?

35:52.150 --> 35:53.440
Fine,believe it or not.

35:53.520 --> 35:57.440
Um,but I do want to apologize for the other night.

35:57.520 --> 35:58.430
Oh,no,no,don'T.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.220
You know,it was actually nice that--

36:00.300 --> 36:04.000
that you thought that maybe we would have a little power over them.

36:04.080 --> 36:07.290
You never made partner,did you?

36:08.380 --> 36:10.370
No.No,I didn'T.

36:10.450 --> 36:13.330
And it was kinda hard to admit at the time.

36:14.490 --> 36:16.200
I'm sorry,kev.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.430
Hey,I'll give a reference to whoever you'd like.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.810
I think you'd make a great barista.

36:22.420 --> 36:24.340
actually,I want to work for you.

36:25.420 --> 36:28.210
You're being serious now,so I--I'm not getting it.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.430
I've spent a long time demonizing you.

36:30.510 --> 36:31.530
Still not getting it.

36:31.610 --> 36:33.760
Okay,when I first met scotty's parents,

36:33.810 --> 36:36.140
I realized that demonizing someone can cut both ways.

36:36.200 --> 36:38.510
Now I'm not saying I can change that.

36:38.570 --> 36:40.320
But I do have a knack for stirring things up.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.720
right.Which I-I don't think is such a great qualification.

36:43.780 --> 36:46.890
I don't think you think that,otherwise you wouldn't have offered me the job.

36:46.950 --> 36:50.050
I think you have to admit,the other night was kind of amazing.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.630
Cause to tell the truth,scotty's parents and i are

36:52.690 --> 36:55.650
 in a much better place now than if we'd talked about elk for three hours.

36:55.710 --> 36:57.660
Quail,but go ahead.

36:57.720 --> 37:01.170
Okay,all I'm asking is that you hear me out,

37:01.230 --> 37:03.890
and if we meet in the middle,that's good enough for me.

37:04.690 --> 37:09.110
Well,I would love to hear you out,but when you didn't respond initially,

37:09.210 --> 37:14.090
we got other candidates,uh,most of whom are very,you know,qualified.

37:14.150 --> 37:16.750
Yeah,with far less emotional baggage.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.120
Okay,I get it.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.790
Let me have it.I deserve it.

37:19.830 --> 37:22.390
We'd love to,but we're extremely busy.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.140
Senate bill 237.

37:26.180 --> 37:27.520
Read it.

37:27.580 --> 37:29.140
Give me an opinion.

37:30.540 --> 37:32.140
Glad to have you.

37:35.710 --> 37:37.270
Talk about hitting the ground running.

37:37.330 --> 37:39.190
Welcome to politics.

37:42.450 --> 37:44.060
God,justin,look who's here.

37:44.120 --> 37:45.500
I know.Come on.

37:45.560 --> 37:46.970
What's going on?

37:50.770 --> 37:52.320
Hello,nora.

37:52.420 --> 37:54.050
What a surprise.

37:54.870 --> 37:58.260
All right,look,we decided that you guys need to deal with this whole ryan situation yourselves.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.810
What are you talking about?

37:59.930 --> 38:01.530
Uh,sorry,mom,but I-I found this,

38:01.610 --> 38:03.950
and I know I probably should've told you earlier.

38:04.010 --> 38:08.430
Mom,this is,uh,information on ryan lafferty that rebecca found on holly's desk.

38:09.350 --> 38:10.840
-At is this? -Rebecca.

38:10.900 --> 38:12.410
I'm sorry,but you guys need to deal with this.

38:12.470 --> 38:14.860
If rebecca and i are gonna have any chance,this can't be our problem.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.670
I'm sure you guys will figure it out,so...

38:16.720 --> 38:18.530
so on that note,mom,have a seat.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.680
Good luck.

38:19.760 --> 38:22.030
And,uh,try the,uh,the seafoosalad.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.790
It's fantastic.

38:33.980 --> 38:35.780
Did you contact ryan?

38:35.880 --> 38:37.180
No.

38:37.500 --> 38:41.030
But,oh,I was tempted to.

38:41.910 --> 38:43.700
Oh,holly.

38:43.760 --> 38:46.890
I know more than anyone what you're going through.

38:47.410 --> 38:49.960
I suggest you let william go.

38:50.060 --> 38:55.460
My only interest in ryan has nothing to do with his father.

38:55.850 --> 38:59.620
Why is it I think the only thing left for you to be interested in 

38:59.680 --> 39:04.060
would be making my life asncomfortable as possle?

39:04.740 --> 39:08.010
how typically narcissistic of you.

39:08.070 --> 39:10.210
I like to think of it as self-preservation.

39:10.290 --> 39:13.460
Holly,I'm telling you,this is better left alone.

39:13.540 --> 39:17.260
Mm,right,the way sarah left it alone when she told rebecca

39:17.340 --> 39:21.590
that william was her father after I begged her not to,which by the way,

39:21.670 --> 39:23.590
turned out not even to be true.

39:23.650 --> 39:25.810
And we have barely recovered from all of that.

39:25.870 --> 39:27.850
Why would you even consider doing this?

39:27.940 --> 39:29.860
Well,it might be fun.

39:32.150 --> 39:37.250
You know,it--it is so amusing watching you panic

39:37.310 --> 39:40.310
when things don't turn out exactly the way you have it planned,

39:40.390 --> 39:46.700
and,oh,god forbid that I upset your perfect little apple cart.

39:46.780 --> 39:50.540
Well,at least I have an apple cart.

39:50.640 --> 39:55.800
you know,holly,I-I really think it's your jealousy that makes me pity you the most.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.560
Pity?

39:57.620 --> 40:02.910
And I don't believe for one minute you'd be willing to jeopardize your relationship with rebecca,

40:02.950 --> 40:08.030
because if you do anything-- I never said that I was going to do anything.

40:08.090 --> 40:10.300
I probably won'T.

40:11.930 --> 40:16.770
But then again,I do have these bad days...

40:19.460 --> 40:22.540
maybe you should call him.

40:22.790 --> 40:25.100
It's probably best...

40:25.180 --> 40:27.600
if you found him first.

40:30.150 --> 40:32.190
Have a nice day,nora.
