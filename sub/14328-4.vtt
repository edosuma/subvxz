AND THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING LEFT!

19:14.686 --> 19:16.722
THEN WE HAVE TO GET
THE LAST ITEM.

19:16.788 --> 19:18.423
IF WE TIE, WE MIGHT
NOT HAVE WON,

19:18.490 --> 19:20.058
BUT WE DON'T LOSE
EITHER, RIGHT?

19:20.125 --> 19:21.860
REMY CAN'T WIN, TIMMY!

19:21.927 --> 19:23.128
HE JUST CAN'T!

19:23.195 --> 19:25.664
I LOVE THAT NICKEL!
I MEAN, WANDA!

19:25.731 --> 19:27.432
PLEASE, YOU CAN'T LOSE!

19:27.499 --> 19:28.767
AND WE WON'T.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.271
TO ANCIENT PERU!

19:35.440 --> 19:36.708
YOU GUYS, LOOK.

19:36.775 --> 19:39.478
{\an1}REMY AND HIS RICH-BOY
TIME LIMO BEAT US HERE.

19:39.545 --> 19:40.979
WE GOT TO GET
IN THERE AND FIND

19:41.046 --> 19:43.815
{\an5}THE GRANDE TREASURE
OF THE PERUVIAN
PYRAMID

19:43.882 --> 19:45.017
BEFORE REMY DOES!

19:55.460 --> 19:56.995
WHICH ONE IS
THE GRANDE TREASURE

19:57.062 --> 19:58.530
OF THE PERUVIAN
PYRAMID?

19:58.597 --> 20:00.065
Juandissimo: IT COULD BE
ANY OF THEM,

20:00.132 --> 20:01.733
SO LET US TAKE THEM ALL.

20:04.002 --> 20:06.305
I WIN, TURNER.
[LAUGHS]

20:06.371 --> 20:09.107
{\an5}I LOOK FORWARD
TO STANDING ATOP
A WEDDING CAKE WITH YOU.

20:11.677 --> 20:13.011
OH, THAT'S WEIRD.

20:13.078 --> 20:17.249
{\an4}WHAT'S WEIRD?
THAT I'M NOT STRANGLING
COSMO RIGHT NOW?

20:17.316 --> 20:18.550
WELL, YES, THAT,

20:18.617 --> 20:20.419
AND THE FACT THAT IN
EVERY MOVIE I'VE SEEN

20:20.485 --> 20:21.920
WITH ANCIENT PYRAMIDS
AND TREASURES,

20:21.987 --> 20:23.322
AS SOON AS YOU STEAL THE STUFF,

20:23.388 --> 20:25.023
A BUNCH OF BOOBY TRAPS GO OFF.

20:25.090 --> 20:26.425
WELL, I'M A BOOB,

20:26.491 --> 20:29.595
AND WANDA TRAPPED ME
INTO MARRIAGE.

20:29.661 --> 20:30.829
DOES THAT
MEAN ANYTHING?

20:30.896 --> 20:33.432
{\an1}NO, BUT I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT IT DOES MEAN.

20:33.498 --> 20:36.501
{\an1}THEY DIDN'T GET THE REAL
TREASURE AFTER ALL!

20:36.568 --> 20:37.836
[PUFF]

20:38.837 --> 20:42.574
YAY! BOOBY TRAP!
WE FOUND THE REAL TREASURE!

20:42.641 --> 20:44.810
I MEAN, OH, NO!
BOOBY TRAPS!

20:44.876 --> 20:45.877
RUN!

20:52.684 --> 20:55.053
{\an1}YOU KNOW, WE COULD'VE
JUST POOFED OUT.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.088
{\an1}OH, YEAH.

21:04.229 --> 21:06.131
OH, NO!
WE'RE TOO LATE!

21:06.198 --> 21:08.300
TURNER, JUST IN TIME

21:08.367 --> 21:12.337
{\an4}TO SEE ME GIVE CUPID
THE FINAL ITEM
ON THE LIST,

21:12.404 --> 21:16.074
{\an1}THE GRANDE TREASURE
OF THE PERUVIAN PYRAMID.

21:20.412 --> 21:22.648
{\an4}WOULD YOU MIND
NAMING OUR CHILDREN
AFTER ME?

21:22.714 --> 21:25.450
I'LL TAKE MY RULE-FREE
WISHES NOW.

21:25.517 --> 21:27.352
SHINY LIKE A NICKEL,

21:27.419 --> 21:29.021
BUT NOT WHAT I WANTED.

21:29.087 --> 21:30.155
WHAT?

21:30.222 --> 21:32.658
ACTUALLY, I THINK
HE WANTS THIS.

21:34.860 --> 21:40.799
{\an4}100% PURE
PERUVIAN COFFEE BEANS!
YAY!

21:40.866 --> 21:43.535
AND HERE'S
A DINOSAUR EGG

21:43.602 --> 21:45.837
{\an4}[CRASH]

21:43.602 --> 21:45.837
AND A POT OF
IRISH GOLD.

21:45.904 --> 21:48.740
BUT I GOT THE MOON CONTAINER
FULL OF ORANGE ASTRO DRINK,

21:48.807 --> 21:51.276
THE BANANA, AND THE DANISH.

21:51.343 --> 21:52.511
THAT MEANS WE'RE TIED.

21:52.577 --> 21:53.945
SO WHO WINS?

21:54.012 --> 21:54.946
{\an1}I DID,

21:55.013 --> 21:57.349
{\an1}AND WITH THIS
IRISH GOLD.

21:57.416 --> 21:58.483
POTATOES?

21:58.550 --> 22:02.054
TO MAKE GOLDEN HASH BROWNS!

22:02.120 --> 22:03.822
{\an1}I'M GOING TO MAKE
THE BEST HASH BROWN,

22:03.889 --> 22:07.959
{\an4}DINOSAUR OMELET, BANANA,
COFFEE, AND ORANGE
ASTRO DRINK BRUNCH EVER!

22:09.094 --> 22:10.796
WAS THIS
A SCAVENGER HUNT,

22:10.862 --> 22:13.999
OR DID WE JUST DO
YOUR GROCERY SHOPPING?

22:14.066 --> 22:15.834
OH, A LITTLE OF BOTH.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.269
MOSTLY THE SHOPPING PART.

22:17.335 --> 22:19.471
{\an1}YOU DON'T EXPECT ME
TO DO MY OWN SHOPPING,

22:19.538 --> 22:22.040
DO YOU, SILLY?

22:22.107 --> 22:23.075
TRUCE?

22:23.141 --> 22:24.209
TRUCE.

22:28.547 --> 22:30.849
GET HIM!

22:28.547 --> 22:30.849
{\an3}GET HIM!

22:32.951 --> 22:34.786
GOOD THING I'M WEARING
A DIAPER.

22:37.689 --> 22:41.359
YOU ARE ALL
OFF MY LIST!

22:41.426 --> 22:43.662
CARE FOR AN OMELET,
REMY, OLD BUDDY?

22:43.729 --> 22:46.098
{\an1}INDUBITABLY,
TIMMY, OLD BEAN.

22:46.164 --> 22:48.867
{\an1}CARE FOR A GLASS OF
ASTRO DRINK?

22:48.934 --> 22:50.736
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

22:50.802 --> 22:53.405
{\an5}HA HA!
SO NOBODY WON
AND NOBODY LOST,

22:53.472 --> 22:55.240
WHICH MEANS I'M NOT
IN TROUBLE, RIGHT?

22:55.307 --> 22:57.109
{\an1}LET ME ANSWER THAT
WITH A LIMERICK.

22:57.175 --> 22:59.411
{\an1}TWO FAIRIES GOT A THOUGHT
IN THEIR HEAD

22:59.478 --> 23:02.047
{\an1}THAT A BET COULD
DECIDE WHO I'D WED,

23:02.114 --> 23:03.815
{\an1}WHILE THEY BATTLED
THEIR BOUT,

23:03.882 --> 23:05.817
{\an1}THEIR BIG SECRET
GOT OUT,

23:05.884 --> 23:08.887
AND NOW BOTH OF
THOSE MORONS ARE DEAD.

23:08.954 --> 23:10.655
{\an1}THAT'S US!
TRUCE?

23:10.722 --> 23:12.491
A VERY SEXY TRUCE?

23:12.557 --> 23:14.159
Both: RUN!

23:15.327 --> 23:17.763
A NICKEL! MINE.

23:17.829 --> 23:19.097
IT WAS WORTH IT!

23:19.164 --> 23:23.969
Cupid: SILLY!

23:24.035 --> 23:26.972
{\an8}CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
NICKELODEON

23:27.038 --> 23:29.975
{\an7}CAPTIONED BY THE NATIONAL
CAPTIONING INSTITUTE
