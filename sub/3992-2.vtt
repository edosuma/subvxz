WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:03.018
Previously on Hannibal.

00:03.070 --> 00:05.698
- The light from friendship
won't reach us for

00:05.730 --> 00:08.563
a million years. That's how far
away from friendship we are.

00:08.600 --> 00:11.660
- It would seem _Jack Crawford is
less SUSplClOUS of me
than you are.

00:11.710 --> 00:15.168
- Jack Crawford doesn't know
what you're capable of.
- Neither do you.

00:15.210 --> 00:18.646
- You maintain an air
of transparency,

00:18.680 --> 00:21.513
while putting me in the position
to lie for you.

00:21.550 --> 00:24.439
- Someone went through a lot of
trouble to make sure they were
well preserved. They've been

00:24.490 --> 00:27.118
coated in some kind of resin.
- (Beverly): There are a lot
of people missing.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.253
- You want to know how he's
choosnng them, don't you?

00:29.290 --> 00:31.758
- Tell me what you see.
(man screaming)

00:34.500 --> 00:37.128
- Ugh...

00:37.170 --> 00:38.728
Ah...

00:38.770 --> 00:41.295
(yelling in pain)

00:47.140 --> 00:50.473
(yelling in pain)

00:59.620 --> 01:02.054
(yelling in pain)

01:15.540 --> 01:17.701
(yelling in pain)

01:34.820 --> 01:36.424
Ah!

01:50.270 --> 01:53.501
Ah!
(truck door opened)

02:02.950 --> 02:05.783
(groaning in pain)

03:13.360 --> 03:15.214
Ah!

03:20.000 --> 03:21.922
(gunshot)

04:12.920 --> 04:15.275
- I've lost the plot.

04:20.520 --> 04:23.887
I am the unreliable narrator

04:23.930 --> 04:26.626
of my own story.

04:26.660 --> 04:29.026
_- You have
an Incomplete self.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.824
There are pieces of you...

04:31.870 --> 04:33.838
you can't see.

04:33.870 --> 04:36.566
- I'm afraid to see.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.635
I don't know

04:38.670 --> 04:40.672
who I am anymore.

04:44.950 --> 04:46.941
And I'm afraid.

04:46.980 --> 04:50.643
- Without remembering, you're
seized by something imagined.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.454
- I_don't know
which IS worse.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.553
Believing I did it...

04:59.560 --> 05:01.653
...or, um, believing
that you did it

05:01.700 --> 05:04.396
and...

05:04.430 --> 05:07.558
did this to me.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.603
- Hannibal isn't
responsrble, WI”.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.677
And neither are you.
We have to get to the truth

05:13.710 --> 05:16.577
of what happened. It's the only
way you can move forward.

05:22.750 --> 05:26.550
- I felt so betrayed by you.

05:26.590 --> 05:28.387
Betrayal was

05:28.420 --> 05:31.389
the only thing
that felt real to me.

05:31.430 --> 05:33.091
I...

05:33.130 --> 05:35.655
I trusted you.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.394
And I needed to trust you.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.806
- And you can trust me.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.502
- I am very... I'm v--

05:45.540 --> 05:47.633
(He takes a breath.)

05:47.680 --> 05:51.502
I'm very confused.
- Of course you are.

05:51.550 --> 05:54.940
- Will, let us help you.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.016
Let me help you.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.822
- I... I...
I need your help.

06:11.030 --> 06:13.635
(Will crying)
(door buzzer)

06:13.670 --> 06:15.661
(door buzzer)

06:42.600 --> 06:45.899
***

07:13.600 --> 07:15.818
- And what a pleasant
surprise.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.166
Please. Sit down.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.166
- I won't be staying long.

07:25.210 --> 07:28.737
- I'm curious - what couldn't
wait until our next sessron?

07:28.780 --> 07:32.614
- We don't have
a next sessnon.

07:32.650 --> 07:35.118
I am no longer
your therapist.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.548
- May I ask why?

07:39.590 --> 07:44.687
- I have reached the limit
of my efficacy.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.722
I don't believe I can
help you.

07:50.230 --> 07:52.118
- Are you giving me
a referral?

07:52.170 --> 07:55.731
- No. I am simply ending

07:55.770 --> 07:58.807
our patient-psychiatrist
relationship.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.998
- You tried
to end it before.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.115
- I...

08:11.150 --> 08:14.278
am grateful
for your persistence

08:14.320 --> 08:17.585
in engaging me
after my attack.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.121
However, in light of everything
that has happened

08:20.160 --> 08:23.664
with Will Graham,
I have begun

08:23.700 --> 08:27.033
to question your actions -

08:27.070 --> 08:29.163
particularly, your past actions

08:29.200 --> 08:32.909
with regards to me
and my attack.

08:32.940 --> 08:36.842
- Did you share these questions
with Jack Crawford?

08:36.880 --> 08:39.144
- No.

08:39.180 --> 08:41.148
And nor will I.

08:41.180 --> 08:43.546
_ I would look
Just as gle as you.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.649
But perhaps

08:45.690 --> 08:47.612
that is what you intended.

08:47.660 --> 08:50.288
- What exactly
am I guilty of?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.890
- Exactly,
I cannot say.

08:55.060 --> 08:56.994
I've had to draw

08:57.030 --> 08:59.635
a conclusion

08:59.670 --> 09:02.605
based on what I glimpsed
through the stitching

09:02.640 --> 09:04.631
of the person suit
that you wear.

09:06.640 --> 09:10.098
And the conclusion
that I've drawn...

09:10.150 --> 09:13.119
is that you are...

09:13.150 --> 09:14.879
dangerous.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.040
- I'm sorry
you feel that way.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.255
- Please don't come
to my home agaIn.

09:29.630 --> 09:31.621
I will see myself out.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.159
- I'm resuming
Will Graham's therapy.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.970
- To what end?

09:43.010 --> 09:45.001
Besides your own.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.840
- He asked for my help.

09:50.850 --> 09:52.886
- Then maybe
you deserve each other.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.995
- His name is Roland Umber;
same profile as the other
victims -

10:09.040 --> 10:11.133
lived alone,
disappeared from home,

10:11.170 --> 10:13.968
had a large dose of heroin
in his system.

10:14.010 --> 10:18.208
- This victim wasn't unstrung;
he was ripped from his moorings.
- Whatever

10:18.250 --> 10:21.970
his imperfection, it was enough
to aggravate the killer into
tearing him down.

10:22.020 --> 10:24.386
-_ He was discarded
In a tributary over

10:24.420 --> 10:28.208
400 miles away from anything
that feeds into the dam where
the first victims were found.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.023
- Like dandelion seeds,

10:30.060 --> 10:33.029
casting bodies in every
direction but his own.

10:33.060 --> 10:34.425
- Very poetic.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.690
- The buffeting in the current
causes so many

10:36.730 --> 10:39.995
post-mortem injuries, it's
impossible to tell them
from the ones

10:40.040 --> 10:44.659
they got, uh,
when they were alive.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.905
- Excuse me.

10:46.940 --> 10:50.068
- Doctor,
join me over here.

10:50.110 --> 10:52.715
- There may be
trace evidence

10:52.750 --> 10:55.071
preserved in the craquelure.
- What?

10:55.120 --> 10:57.884
- Craquelure.
It's French

10:57.920 --> 11:00.889
for the cracks that appear
on an oil painting as it dries

11:00.920 --> 11:02.751
and it becomes rigid with age.

11:02.790 --> 11:05.054
Cracks are
not always weaknesses.

11:05.090 --> 11:07.354
A life lived
accrues In the cracks.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.197
- Could be something in there -

11:09.230 --> 11:11.824
fiber, debris. Might help track
where the bodies were

11:11.870 --> 11:14.794
before they got dumped.
- What do the victims
have in common?

11:14.840 --> 11:16.865
- What if it isn't
what they have In common?

11:16.910 --> 11:19.401
What if it's
what makes them different?

11:19.440 --> 11:21.806
Each of these people has
a slightly different flesh tone.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.047
It could be
like a color palette.

11:24.080 --> 11:28.016
- The color of our skin is
so often po|ItICIzed.

11:28.050 --> 11:30.985
It would almost be refreshing
to see someone revel

11:31.020 --> 11:33.250
in the aesthetic
for aesthetics' sake -

11:33.290 --> 11:35.315
if it weren't so horrific.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.453
We're supposed
to see color, Jack.

11:37.490 --> 11:40.425
That may be all this killer has
ever seen in his fellow man,

11:40.460 --> 11:43.293
which is why it is so easy
for him to do what he does

11:43.330 --> 11:45.298
to his victims.
- Which is why

11:45.330 --> 11:47.469
there'll be a lot more bodies
on hIs color palette.

11:49.940 --> 11:52.306
- A fascinating insight,
Ms. Katz -

11:52.340 --> 11:54.900
as if Will Graham himself were
here in the room.

11:56.910 --> 11:58.878
- Yes, it is.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.388
How's Will Graham?

12:03.420 --> 12:05.888
Shut your mouth.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.185
Is there a reason
you dIdn't come to me

12:10.230 --> 12:12.323
before you decided
to go talk to him?

12:12.360 --> 12:16.820
- I figured you'd say no.
- You figured correctly.
- But I knew

12:16.870 --> 12:20.260
you'd want to say yes.
- You knew that?

12:20.300 --> 12:23.007
- You put me
in an awkward position, Jack.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.133
I had to go
because I knew you wouldn't.

12:25.170 --> 12:27.400
If you had gone like you wanted,
I wouldn't have had to.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.340
Why didn't you?

12:31.380 --> 12:34.213
- Because Will Graham is either
deluSIonal or a psychopath,

12:34.250 --> 12:36.070
neither of which I can trust.

12:36.120 --> 12:39.180
- Fine, so don't trust him;
just listen to him.

12:39.220 --> 12:41.882
- I'm listening.
This is what I'm hearing:

12:41.920 --> 12:44.286
if he's delusional, it's because
I made him that way;

12:44.330 --> 12:48.152
if he's a psychopath, it's
because everything
in my gut is wrong.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.191
- You think
he's Innocent.

12:50.230 --> 12:52.369
- I don't know
what I think.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.364
- I think he still wants to save
lives. That's what I think.

12:58.410 --> 13:01.868
7 I have bent the rules here
In the name of saVIng |Ives.

13:01.910 --> 13:04.504
_ Now there is _
an Internal InvestIgatIon.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.506
I'm under the microscope.

13:06.550 --> 13:10.384
The Office of the Inspector
General has ordered a psych eval

13:10.420 --> 13:13.150
to determine my competency
to sit in this chair.

13:13.190 --> 13:15.158
- Well, what do you
want me to do?

13:15.190 --> 13:18.250
If you don't want me
to go back, I won't.

13:24.930 --> 13:28.195
- We didn't have
this conversation.

13:30.210 --> 13:33.031
And... since we didn't have
this conversation,

13:33.080 --> 13:35.435
I want you to go and do
whatever it is you believe

13:35.480 --> 13:39.917
it is your job to do.
Do you know what your job is?

13:41.920 --> 13:43.478
- Yes, I do.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.080
- Then do it.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.992
(smelling)

14:53.290 --> 14:56.111
- I've been advised to stay
on this side of the line.

14:56.160 --> 15:00.256
- Select patients have taken
to urinating on the therapists.

15:00.300 --> 15:04.088
- I would argue
drawing a line might
encourage a pissing contest.

15:04.130 --> 15:06.394
_- I'm not interested
In a pIssmg contest

15:06.430 --> 15:09.092
with you, Dr. Lecter.

15:09.140 --> 15:11.131
Please, pull up your chair.

15:21.180 --> 15:23.683
- You said the light
from friendship won't reach us

15:23.720 --> 15:27.087
for a million years -
that's how far away we are.

15:27.120 --> 15:30.226
I hope our friendship feels
closer today.

15:30.260 --> 15:33.297
- Friends hav_e _
a symmetrIcal relatIonshIp.

15:33.330 --> 15:36.458
Psychiatrist and patient,
that's unbalanced.

15:36.500 --> 15:40.334
- There is a power differential
between psychiatrist
and patient...

15:42.340 --> 15:45.730
...one that I'm well aware of,
particularly with my own
therapist.

15:45.770 --> 15:48.432
_ -_ But we're _
Just haVIng conversatIons.

15:52.510 --> 15:55.479
- You threatened me
with a reckoning.
- I did.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.648
I can't claim unconsciousness
on that one.

15:58.690 --> 16:03.423
- You were searching for
something in your head
to incriminate me.

16:05.430 --> 16:07.398
I can only assume
you didn't find it.

16:07.430 --> 16:10.365
- There's not much in there
I recognIze.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.368
- Whatever you remember,

16:12.400 --> 16:15.631
if you do remember,
will be a distortion of reality,

16:15.670 --> 16:17.638
not the truth of events.

16:17.670 --> 16:20.537
- I'm realizing that.

16:25.810 --> 16:28.017
- Beverly Katz has come
to see you.

16:29.820 --> 16:32.288
- Yes.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.686
- Wouldn't want Alana Blo_om
to worry about you dweIIIng

16:34.720 --> 16:38.121
on anything morbid in what's
to be a time of recovery.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.128
- It's the only thing
that feels normal.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.525
- The violence?

16:41.560 --> 16:45.121
- The structure
of understanding the violence.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.196
- You're missing
pieces of yourself. Careful
what you replace them with.

16:52.310 --> 16:54.403
What did you see
in the pictures?

16:56.410 --> 16:58.378
- This killer...

16:58.410 --> 17:00.378
he's not stringing
his victims up;

17:00.420 --> 17:02.775
he's stitching them
together.

17:02.820 --> 17:06.415
Each body is
a brushstroke.

17:08.420 --> 17:10.650
He's making
a human mural.

17:12.660 --> 17:14.719
- Why does he do it?

17:14.760 --> 17:16.751
- He's missing pieces too.

17:25.340 --> 17:27.308
Dr. Lecter has

17:27.340 --> 17:29.774
advised me against dwelling
on anything morbid.

17:29.810 --> 17:33.348
- I know you want to stop
these murders as much as I do.

17:33.380 --> 17:37.817
- Reasons for stopping multiple
murders do readily occur to me,

17:37.850 --> 17:39.442
but, um...

17:41.460 --> 17:43.655
...I'm going to need
something in return.

17:43.690 --> 17:47.251
- There are things
you don't have? I can
talk to the chief of staff.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.655
- Chilton?
- He's being very cooperative.

17:49.700 --> 17:52.260
- Of course he is._ _
He loves when I have VISItors.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.336
He's recording
every word.

17:54.370 --> 17:57.259
He's, uh,
gossipy that way.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.369
- What do you want, Will?

17:59.410 --> 18:02.777
- I'm wondering if you can
get me the thing I really want.

18:02.810 --> 18:04.471
- Try me.

18:04.510 --> 18:08.571
- I want you to ignore
all the evidence against me.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.781
- You're right.

18:10.820 --> 18:12.412
I can't get that.

18:16.190 --> 18:20.126
- How many colors
will this killer add
to his box of crayons?

18:21.930 --> 18:24.569
- Say I ignore the evidence
against you. What then?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.761
- Strike it
from your mental record.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.234
Start over.

18:29.270 --> 18:31.738
If I'm guilty,
you'll find more evidence;

18:31.770 --> 18:35.171
if I'm not guilty,
you'll maybe find that too.

18:37.180 --> 18:38.704
- All right.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.548
I'll keep looking.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.343
- Good.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.585
Give me the ﬁle.
I'll tell you what I think.

18:58.300 --> 19:01.292
Do you mind ifI do this
privately?
- Yes.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.552
- The skin isn't as discolored
as the other victims'.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.528
Looks fairly well preserved,

20:01.560 --> 20:03.391
all things considered.

20:03.430 --> 20:05.489
Why would I throw you away?

20:13.680 --> 20:16.706
Did Roland Umber have priors
with substance abuse?

20:16.740 --> 20:19.004
- He was in an outpatient
treatment program

20:19.050 --> 20:21.610
for drug addiction.
- Heroin?

20:21.650 --> 20:23.379
- Among others.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.280
- He had a high tolerance
for opiates.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.459
The overdose didn't
kill him.

20:30.490 --> 20:33.391
He survived
what was done to him.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.927
He tore himself free.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.758
He ran.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.904
- How did he
end up in the water?
- Killer didn't put him there.

20:46.940 --> 20:49.909
He'd have put him back
in the mural if he caught him.

20:49.940 --> 20:53.444
Other bodies were dumped;
Roland Umber got away.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.448
- Got away from where?
- This killer,

20:55.480 --> 20:58.017
he, um, he needs someplace
private to do what he does -

20:58.050 --> 21:01.884
a warehouse, a farm,
someplace abandoned, upstream

21:01.920 --> 21:05.549
from where the body was found.
It'll be close to the water.

21:05.590 --> 21:07.490
- Thank you.

21:12.430 --> 21:14.694
- I'm curious. What'd

21:14.740 --> 21:16.867
Hannibal Lecter have to say
about Mr. Umber?

21:16.900 --> 21:20.973
- He thinks
the killer tore him down,
dumped his body like the others.

21:21.010 --> 21:24.639
- That may be
what he said;

21:24.680 --> 21:27.376
it's not necessarily
what he thinks.

23:08.220 --> 23:12.088
- Hello.
I love your work.

23:32.940 --> 23:35.170
How ever did you find
this place?

23:35.210 --> 23:38.145
- You and Will Graham are
a good team.

23:38.180 --> 23:41.445
You gave us the "what" we were
looking for; he gave us
the "where."

23:41.480 --> 23:44.085
Corn dust
on the craquelure.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.987
- Yes, Will and
I do make a good team.
- Will didn't think Roland

23:47.020 --> 23:49.887
Umber was discarded; he escaped.
We just went upstream

23:49.920 --> 23:52.650
from where the body was found
until we hit corn.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.497
- Hey, Beverly.

23:59.530 --> 24:00.895
Dr. Lecter.

24:00.940 --> 24:04.467
Follow me, please.
You might want

24:04.510 --> 24:06.865
to prepare yourself. You've
never seen anything like this.

24:06.910 --> 24:08.901
- I'm sure I haven't.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.963
- How could a human being
go so bad?

24:33.970 --> 24:35.995
- When it comes to
nature versus nurture,

24:36.040 --> 24:37.905
I choose neither.

24:39.910 --> 24:42.003
We are built
from a DNA blueprint

24:42.040 --> 24:44.600
and born into_a world
of scenarIo and CIrcumstance

24:44.650 --> 24:46.743
we don't control.

24:46.780 --> 24:49.647
- Praise
the mutilated world, huh?

24:49.680 --> 24:51.716
- What did it look like
from above?

24:58.560 --> 24:59.925
Fascinating.

24:59.960 --> 25:02.292
- Ritual human sacrifice.

25:02.330 --> 25:04.764
_ -_ I'm not sure
If It's an offerIng,

25:04.800 --> 25:06.768
but it's certainly
a gesture.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.598
- To whom?

25:09.640 --> 25:13.599
- The eye looks beyond
this world into the next

25:13.640 --> 25:16.905
and sees the reflection
of man himself.

25:16.940 --> 25:20.103
Is the killer looking
at God?

25:20.150 --> 25:23.210
- Maybe it's some sick
existential crisis.

25:23.250 --> 25:27.209
-_If it were an existential
crISIs, I would argue there
wouldn't be any reflection

25:27.250 --> 25:29.957
in the eye at all.
- A person who could do

25:29.990 --> 25:32.083
this kind of thing,
would they be likely

25:32.130 --> 25:34.951
to continue doing it?
- This could be his beginning.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.629
And/or his end.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.638
He may never kill again.

25:40.670 --> 25:44.106
- You said
he doesn't see people,

25:44.140 --> 25:46.131
that he sees material.

25:48.140 --> 25:50.870
- Those in the world around him
are a means to an end.

25:50.910 --> 25:54.243
He uses them to do
what he's driven to do.

25:54.280 --> 25:57.249
- Will Graham was
a means to an end.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.941
I used him

25:58.990 --> 26:01.288
to do what I was driven to do,
to save lives

26:01.320 --> 26:03.288
at the expense of his.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.255
I thought whatever I could put
him through, he would be strong

26:06.290 --> 26:08.929
enough to fight his way back
to himself, and I was wrong.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.894
- Maybe he's still fighting.

26:10.930 --> 26:12.966
- Maybe he's not.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.697
- Point is,
you don't know.

26:16.740 --> 26:19.231
It's OK
not to know.

26:19.270 --> 26:23.377
You can't know everything.
You can't be certain of it all.

26:23.410 --> 26:25.799
- Knowing that Will descended
into such savage behavior

26:25.850 --> 26:29.217
has changed the way
that I see him,

26:29.250 --> 26:31.389
the way that I see
other people.

26:31.420 --> 26:33.752
The world feels
much darker.

26:33.790 --> 26:36.258
It's not just

26:36.290 --> 26:38.622
the guilt of what I did
to Will Graham;

26:38.660 --> 26:42.619
it's the guilt of watching all
these other lives fall apart
based on what I did.

26:42.660 --> 26:44.628
- What did you do?
- I pushed him.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.626
When I was warned to back off,
I kept pushing him.

26:46.670 --> 26:48.831
- You miscalculated.
- I failed.

26:48.870 --> 26:50.838
I failed.

26:56.110 --> 26:58.101
- We all fail, Jack.

27:01.420 --> 27:04.241
- I look at my friend
and I see a killer.

27:04.290 --> 27:08.852
I'm failing to reconcile
those two things.

27:08.890 --> 27:11.222
- (Beverly): Forty-seven bodies.
We've identified

27:11.260 --> 27:14.718
19 of them, but not this one.
- No record of fingerprints.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.194
He was never arrested
or In any kInd of a job that

27:17.230 --> 27:19.960
required any type of security
clearance or background check.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.731
- Hopefully
he's been to a dentist.
- Why am I lookIng at thIs man?

27:23.770 --> 27:26.136
- Stitch patterns on John Doe 21
match Roland Umber.

27:26.170 --> 27:30.436
- John Doe 21 is_Roland Umber's
replacement In the mural.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.199
- What happened to his leg?
- Maybe the killer

27:33.250 --> 27:35.343
had to cut off his leg
just so he'd fit.

27:37.420 --> 27:40.810
_*** _
(claSSIcal mu5Ic)

27:40.860 --> 27:43.112
- He changed colors
mid-brushstroke.

27:43.160 --> 27:45.151
_*** _
(claSSIcal mu5Ic)

27:49.460 --> 27:52.725
- What did Dr. Lecter say?

27:56.940 --> 28:00.159
"The eye looks beyond
this world, into the next,

28:00.210 --> 28:02.872
and sees a _reflection
of man hImself."

28:09.280 --> 28:11.817
There was never supposed
to be a reflection.

28:11.850 --> 28:13.715
The killer's having

28:13.760 --> 28:16.911
an existential cr_isis_after all.
The questIon IS...

28:16.960 --> 28:19.224
how did he find his faith?

29:05.340 --> 29:07.308
- Hello, Doctor.

29:07.340 --> 29:11.049
What can I help you with?

29:11.080 --> 29:12.877
- Closure.

29:14.880 --> 29:19.340
I think perhaps this should,
or may have to be,

29:19.390 --> 29:22.257
our last conversation -

29:22.290 --> 29:25.123
at least on the subject
of Hannibal Lecter.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.093
- Are you pleading
the Fifth?

29:30.130 --> 29:33.099
- No.

29:33.130 --> 29:35.963
I simply can't offer you
any more insight

29:36.000 --> 29:38.139
than I already have.

29:38.170 --> 29:41.298
- Not accounting
for future insight?

29:41.340 --> 29:45.344
- I feel it would be
irresponsible

29:45.380 --> 29:48.247
ifI continue
to see Dr. Lecter.

29:48.280 --> 29:51.386
- Irresponsible?

29:51.420 --> 29:53.183
For who?

29:53.220 --> 29:54.881
- For me.

29:56.890 --> 30:01.259
I can only help Hannibal
if I'm feeling secure

30:01.300 --> 30:03.860
emotionally.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.528
I'm not feeling secure
right now,

30:06.570 --> 30:09.539
so I am recusing myself

30:09.570 --> 30:12.209
from the situation.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.208
I hope you understand.

30:14.240 --> 30:17.471
- I'm not sure I do.

30:19.580 --> 30:22.879
- Hannibal and I were
both traumatized

30:22.920 --> 30:25.889
by dangerous patients.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.252
Hannibal had
his Will Graham,

30:28.290 --> 30:30.258
and I had mine.

30:30.290 --> 30:33.487
It has been
a necessary

30:33.530 --> 30:36.351
albeit unpleasant
reminder

30:36.400 --> 30:39.426
that I have
unresolved Issues.

30:39.470 --> 30:42.030
- Maybe Hannibal can help you
resolve these issues.

30:42.070 --> 30:44.129
He is very good.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.939
- I am doing my best to avoid
working through my issues

30:49.980 --> 30:51.948
with Hannibal Lecter.

30:51.980 --> 30:55.211
Goodbye, Agent Crawford.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

30:55.250 --> 30:57.980
- Obviously, I cannot control
whether or not

30:58.020 --> 31:00.887
the FBI contacts me.
I can only tell you

31:00.920 --> 31:03.059
what I told Hannibal:

31:03.090 --> 31:06.025
I prefer that you don't.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.537
- Oh, now you're
just taking advantage.

31:15.570 --> 31:18.539
You're going to burn me out
before my trial,

31:18.570 --> 31:20.561
and then where will I be?

31:20.610 --> 31:24.000
What would Jack say?

31:24.050 --> 31:28.475
- Jack's excellent
administrative instincts are
not often tempered by mercy.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.409
- Clearly.
- I'm devoting a lot of time

31:31.450 --> 31:35.216
to this mural, Will.
It's hard for me to focus
on anythIng else I've been

31:35.260 --> 31:38.081
tasked to do.
Could use your help.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.533
- In the 19th century,
it was

31:51.570 --> 31:54.004
wrongly believed that
the last image seen by the eyes

31:54.040 --> 31:58.044
of a dying person would be
fixed on the retina.

31:58.080 --> 32:01.447
What would be the last image
fixed on this dying eye?

32:28.040 --> 32:31.305
- I made you pliable.

32:33.310 --> 32:35.244
Molded you.

32:35.280 --> 32:39.148
Set and sealed you
where you lay.

32:39.190 --> 32:42.512
This is my design.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.653
A dead eye of...

32:44.690 --> 32:47.181
vision...

32:47.230 --> 32:50.620
and consciousness.
I am

32:50.660 --> 32:53.959
fixed and unseeing.

32:58.040 --> 33:00.429
Unless
someone else sees me.

33:07.780 --> 33:10.044
One of these things

33:10.080 --> 33:13.288
is not like the others.

33:13.320 --> 33:17.256
One of these things
just doesn't belong.

33:21.330 --> 33:23.525
Who are you?

33:27.100 --> 33:29.068
Why are you so different

33:29.100 --> 33:31.068
from everyone else?

33:31.110 --> 33:33.066
I didn't put you here.

33:33.110 --> 33:35.499
You...

33:35.540 --> 33:37.508
are not my design.

33:37.540 --> 33:39.349
(hooves clopping)

34:06.310 --> 34:08.471
- Killing must feel good
to God too.

34:08.510 --> 34:12.207
He does it
all the time,

34:12.250 --> 34:14.775
and are we_ not created
In HIs Image?

34:24.860 --> 34:27.181
- The killer is
in the mural.

34:27.230 --> 34:29.619
- What do you mean? Literally?
- I mean, the man you're

34:29.660 --> 34:32.663
looking for is sewn
into his own mural - this man.

34:32.700 --> 34:34.793
- What happened
to his leg?

34:34.840 --> 34:38.298
- Whoever sewed him in
took a piece of him.

34:38.340 --> 34:40.808
As a trophy.

34:42.810 --> 34:45.347
- He must have had
a friend.

34:48.220 --> 34:51.542
You're not alone, you know?
In The Resurrection,

34:51.590 --> 34:54.616
Piero della Francesca placed
himself in the fresco.

34:54.660 --> 34:59.620
Nothing flattering - he depicted
himself as a simple guard
asleep at his post.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.424
Your placement should be
much more meaningful.

35:07.470 --> 35:10.132
- It's not finished.

35:10.170 --> 35:11.569
- I'm finishing it for you.

35:13.570 --> 35:17.700
We'll finish it together.
When your great eye

35:17.740 --> 35:21.312
looked to the heavens,
what did it see?

35:21.350 --> 35:23.614
- Nothing.

35:23.650 --> 35:26.244
- Not anymore.

35:26.290 --> 35:29.453
- There is no God.

35:29.490 --> 35:31.754
- Certainly not
with that attitude.

35:31.790 --> 35:34.190
God gave you purpose -

35:34.230 --> 35:38.394
Not only to create art,
but to become it.

35:38.430 --> 35:41.399
- Why are you helping me?

35:44.710 --> 35:48.134
- Your eye will now see God
reflected back.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.448
It will see you.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.539
If God is looking
down at you,

35:55.580 --> 35:57.673
don't you want to be looking
back at Him?

36:19.840 --> 36:21.831
(footsteps)

36:30.520 --> 36:31.919
- Will Graham.

36:33.450 --> 36:36.214
Kade Purnell,
Office of the Inspector General,

36:36.260 --> 36:37.852
FBI Oversight.

36:37.890 --> 36:39.949
- Am I still
an FBI employee?

36:39.990 --> 36:43.551
Or is that pending
the outcome of my trial?

36:43.600 --> 36:47.263
- The point of the trial
isn't so much whether
or not you did it;

36:47.300 --> 36:50.337
it's whether or not you knew
what you were doing
when you did it.

36:50.370 --> 36:53.430
- Sounds like
I'm unemployed.

36:55.440 --> 36:58.739
- Dr. Bloom is_ hard at work
on your unconSCIousness defense.

36:58.780 --> 37:00.338
- Ah, yes, yes,

37:00.380 --> 37:03.019
the FBI made me do it.
- The FBI made you

37:03.050 --> 37:06.542
a murderer. Yes, that is
Dr. Bloom's position.

37:06.590 --> 37:09.388
As you can imagine,
she's not popular.

37:09.420 --> 37:11.820
- What's your position?

37:11.860 --> 37:14.749
- Our point of view is that
you were already a murderer.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.597
The prosecution

37:16.630 --> 37:20.361
will paint a picture of you
as an intelligent psychopath.

37:20.400 --> 37:24.029
You conspired
with your neurologist
to cultivate an illness

37:24.070 --> 37:26.038
that would ultimately be
your alibi.

37:26.070 --> 37:28.903
- And then I killed
my neurologist

37:28.940 --> 37:31.909
to broom the footprints
behind me?

37:31.950 --> 37:33.906
- That's what everyone
in the courtroom will hear

37:33.950 --> 37:36.771
when you take the stand,
regardless of what you say.

37:36.820 --> 37:39.345
- Well, what's to be done
about that?

37:42.320 --> 37:43.719
- Let's discuss it.

37:48.560 --> 37:52.291
If you plead guilty,
you'll spare us all a trial.

37:52.330 --> 37:56.994
And I personally will see to it
that you're comfortable here.

37:59.010 --> 38:01.308
- I'm pleading innocent.

38:01.340 --> 38:04.969
- You very publicly
lost your mind -

38:05.010 --> 38:07.069
some would argue
theatrically.

38:07.110 --> 38:09.419
The prosecution
certainly will.

38:09.450 --> 38:11.543
- All part
of the performance;

38:11.590 --> 38:13.808
it's just not my performance
you're watching.

38:13.850 --> 38:15.408
- You'll be found guilty

38:15.460 --> 38:17.553
and given the federal
death penalty.

38:17.590 --> 38:20.957
I'm trying
to save your life.

38:22.960 --> 38:25.428
- I guess I'll have to save
my own life.

38:50.820 --> 38:53.027
(door buzzer)

38:53.060 --> 38:56.052
(door opening)

39:09.880 --> 39:11.802
I don't know you.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.806
- My name...

39:13.850 --> 39:15.841
is Bedelia Du Maurier.

39:15.880 --> 39:19.441
- You're Hannibal Lecter's
therapIst.

39:23.590 --> 39:25.126
What's that like?

39:25.160 --> 39:29.494
- I've heard so much about you,
I feel I almost know you.

39:29.530 --> 39:31.998
- You don't.
- No, I don't.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.966
ButI understand you better

39:37.000 --> 39:39.867
than I thought. I...

39:39.910 --> 39:43.869
wanted to meet you
before I withdraw.

39:46.650 --> 39:48.618
- What are you
withdrawing from?

39:48.650 --> 39:51.847
- Social ties.
- Well, you're

39:51.890 --> 39:55.917
a psychiatrist.
Isn't our sense of _self_
a consequence of soaal tIes?

39:55.960 --> 39:58.827
- They certainly are
in your case.

39:58.860 --> 40:02.159
It may be
small comfort,

40:02.200 --> 40:06.466
but I am convinced
Hannibal has done

40:06.500 --> 40:09.697
what he honestly believes is
best for you.

40:09.740 --> 40:13.699
- No, that isn't small comfort;
that would be no comfort.

40:13.740 --> 40:16.470
- The traumatized are
unpredIctable

40:16.510 --> 40:19.070
because we know
we can surVIve.

40:19.110 --> 40:23.547
_ You can _survive
thIs happenIng to you.

40:26.250 --> 40:28.457
- Happening to me.

40:30.260 --> 40:33.957
- (guard): Stay
behind the white line, ma'am!

40:33.990 --> 40:36.550
(door buzzer)

40:36.600 --> 40:38.124
M
al
am!

40:40.270 --> 40:43.433
Step away from the bars.
Ma'am!

40:45.240 --> 40:48.004
- (whispering): I believe you.

40:48.040 --> 40:51.032
- (guard): Come on, ma'am,
let's go.

40:51.080 --> 40:52.741
Step away.

42:21.300 --> 42:24.906
- (Bedelia): And the conclusion
that I've drawn...

42:26.910 --> 42:30.937
...is that you are
dangerous.
