22:05.640 --> 22:09.952
Two drops, three times a day.
And no alcohol.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.868
What is it?
- Cocaine.

47:26.240 --> 47:29.027
But what are you doing here?

47:29.200 --> 47:32.260
You would be gone before seven o'clock.

47:32.600 --> 47:35.387
Come on, you're going away anyway.

47:37.080 --> 47:40.106
Hurry up, why do I have to
to say this every day?

48:29.000 --> 48:32.470
Hey, wanderer. Careful.

48:34.640 --> 48:38.952
Watch may, but not touch.

48:40.120 --> 48:42.543
What did I say?
- It's beautiful.

48:42.720 --> 48:45.860
Of course, everything I have is beautiful.

48:46.560 --> 48:48.983
A masterpiece.
- Masterpiece?

48:49.160 --> 48:54.268
Yes, made in the Netherlands.
The land of the tulips.

48:54.440 --> 48:56.226
Costs only 5000.

48:56.400 --> 48:59.790
5000? Too much.
- Too much? Look closely...

51:46.600 --> 51:50.593
Look, the believers.
This is pure magic for them.

51:50.760 --> 51:54.662
Caravaggio catches the moment flat
before the Lord breaks the bread ...

51:54.840 --> 51:58.310
and the believers of Emmaus
Recognize him.

51:58.600 --> 52:01.717
As you know, Caravaggio had
a huge influence ...

52:01.880 --> 52:04.394
on the 17th-century Dutch Masters.

52:04.560 --> 52:08.462
Especially on Rembrandt.
- Not on Johannes Vermeer?

52:08.960 --> 52:10.846
It has not been proven
that he knew Caravaggio.

52:10.960 --> 52:16.034
But we will ever make a connection
find between Vermeer and Caravaggio.

52:16.200 --> 52:17.542
How?

53:01.800 --> 53:03.836
Wait, leave that.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.958
I'm hungry. Hungry.

53:09.440 --> 53:11.499
Money, money.

53:48.600 --> 53:50.033
Waiter...

53:52.520 --> 53:55.148
A bottle of Prosecco, please.

53:55.320 --> 53:58.346
Thank you.
And a room with a bath.

54:09.760 --> 54:11.034
Please.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.103
Thank you.

56:24.880 --> 56:26.393
Thank you.
- Please.

59:54.400 --> 59:56.948
Hello, welcome back.

59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.078
How are you?
- Great, now that I see you.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.946
Very well.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.988
The painting, 3500.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.186
3500? That's what I do it for.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:12.037
Please.
- Thank you, friend.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.875
And greetings to your wife.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.138
It has not been proven
that he knew Caravaggio's work.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:47.518
But we will ever make a connection
find between Vermeer and Caravaggio.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:48.954
The missing link.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.149
Is somebody home?
- No.

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:26.152
Sir? Open up, please.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:31.156
I do not open to anyone.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.988
I'm looking for Mr. van Meegeren.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.999
What do you want?

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:57.869
What?

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:14.190
Beside that blue there ...
- And that hand.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.797
What do you know?

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:24.431
It is the missing link.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:29.664
Yes, that subtlety ...

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.879
Where is it from?
- Perfectly documented.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:37.818
Marquis Doria de Pamphilj.
Bankrupt nobility from Salerno.

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.746
Grandiose.

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:36.268
That dark, Teutonic atmosphere.

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.987
Magnificent.

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.304
Mr. the art dealer ...
- Reich Marshal.

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:48.073
You should also find something like that for me.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:47.077
I'm just
crazy about the Renaissance.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.271
What is the origin?

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.580
Every detail has been recorded.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:59.942
Are the pigments analyzed?

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.379
Do you have the crackle
checked? And the list?

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:08.270
Absolutely, Reich Marshal.
Technically everything is waterproof.

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.590
Around 1654.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.198
Grandiose.

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:30.938
That dark, Teutonic atmosphere.

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.279
Look.
- For me?

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:32.345
No, for Herr Hitler.
Can you give it to the Fuehrer?

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:36.396
Certainly, but you must sign it.

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:38.819
Oh yes, I will.

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.028
Thank you.

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:46.236
<i> In grateful appreciation
dedicated to the beloved FÃ¼hrer </ i></i>

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:02.719
Or that he has fooled Goering,
and the Nazis fooled.
