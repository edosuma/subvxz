Welcome to the Los Angeles
Sheriff's Department!

00:04.830 --> 00:06.036
[audience cheering]

00:06.090 --> 00:07.819
BILL:
Sheriff's an elected official.

00:07.870 --> 00:09.690
Millions of people
vote him in, honey.

00:09.740 --> 00:11.048
I'm no politician.

00:11.090 --> 00:13.046
Can you believe
they made my son sheriff?

00:13.920 --> 00:15.968
All it takes is one person
to try and change that.

00:16.710 --> 00:18.610
Maybe that person
can be you, Sheriff.

00:18.930 --> 00:20.352
I may need a little help.

00:20.710 --> 00:21.881
Are you serious?

00:21.930 --> 00:23.101
-You might be pregnant?
-Shh!

00:23.150 --> 00:24.629
Honey, you're missin' something.

00:24.670 --> 00:26.535
If you leave,
is the hospital better off?

00:26.590 --> 00:27.409
Probably not.

00:27.460 --> 00:28.802
Damn right it isn't.

00:28.850 --> 00:30.408
I was wrong about you, son.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.974
And I refuse to allow you
to feel sorry for yourself.

00:33.460 --> 00:34.802
MINl_\lICK:
Stop lookIn' around.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.509
You gotta earn your way in.

00:36.550 --> 00:37.721
-How?
-Trust.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.590
MAGGIE: Just get over it
and dance.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.161
How about us?

00:43.860 --> 00:45.384
Bulletproof.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.342
[gunshot]

00:56.010 --> 00:57.227
He loves me not.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.666
He loves me.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.929
He loves me not.

01:08.150 --> 01:09.924
[smacks lips]
He loves me not.

01:13.630 --> 01:14.676
He loves you.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.281
_ Has he made
dinner reservations yet?

01:20.860 --> 01:21.940
He will.

01:23.430 --> 01:24.909
He's waiting to find out
where his wife wants to go.

01:25.910 --> 01:27.639
I got a few ideas in mind.

01:28.910 --> 01:30.127
Happy Valentine's Day.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.968
[street noise]

01:48.840 --> 01:50.888
-I can't keep doing this, Jerry.
-You can't just walk away

01:50.930 --> 01:52.363
from 30 years of marriage.

01:52.410 --> 01:53.889
I gave up the chance
to have a family

01:53.930 --> 01:56.103
to stand by you while
you tried to make sheriff.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.937
All of that sacrifice
is about to pay off.

01:59.290 --> 02:01.895
I want you to reap the benefits
when it does.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.333
I couldn't have gotten
this far without you.

02:04.860 --> 02:06.509
We both know if
you were gonna make sheriff,

02:06.560 --> 02:07.811
it would have
happened by now.

02:07.860 --> 02:09.555
Bill has less than
three months left

02:09.600 --> 02:10.851
in his term of office.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.078
I plan on running for the job.

02:13.390 --> 02:17.918
This isn't about you
making or not making sheriff.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.996
We've been living in the past.

02:20.530 --> 02:22.566
-Sign these, Jerry.
-Lydia.

02:22.620 --> 02:25.180
Look, after everything,
the least you could do

02:25.230 --> 02:27.926
is give me my life back
and go have yours.

02:42.030 --> 02:43.065
Thank you.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.931

It's been a while.

02:53.470 --> 02:55.995
-Hey!
-Hey, Dr. Reyes.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.951
Saw your boy on Insta.

02:58.000 --> 02:58.989
[Darian chuckles]

02:59.040 --> 03:00.439
-He's growing quick.
-Yeah.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.380
Gonna get his
rebound game started early

03:02.440 --> 03:03.953
so he can get
some of that NBA coin.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.001
[Paula chuckles]

03:05.050 --> 03:06.392
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

Welcome back, Dr. Reyes.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.857
Happy Valentine's Day.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.116
Thanks, Shanice.

03:37.170 --> 03:38.467
I like what you've done
with the place.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.602
-Any plans?
-Mm, something with lace.

03:41.130 --> 03:42.210
I hear that.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.124
All right,
what do we got today?

03:44.180 --> 03:47.126
Got a scrape up in one,
diabetic eval in three.

03:47.180 --> 03:50.399
And also, David Browder's
back in two.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.091
Why is he here?

03:53.530 --> 03:54.747
I put in a request for
his transfer six months ago.

03:54.790 --> 03:56.314
That's time he doesn't have.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.097
Can you get them
on the line, please?

03:58.150 --> 03:59.833
We need _more volunteers
like you.

03:59.890 --> 04:01.403
Folks at St. Regent's are lucky.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.327
-PAULA: Hmm.

David, David, David!

04:05.850 --> 04:07.067

Dr. Reyes.

04:07.590 --> 04:09.103
You know, I was worried
it was, uh...

04:09.160 --> 04:10.377
I didn't have the right day.

04:10.810 --> 04:12.801
I couldn't get you
one myself, so...

04:13.810 --> 04:14.856
I made it.

04:17.380 --> 04:19.814
Don't worry, I'm not trying to
push up on you or anything.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.815
I got my own Valentine.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.209
I wanted you to know
that I appreciate

04:25.220 --> 04:26.608
everything you've done for me.

04:26.650 --> 04:27.821
Thanks, David. This is...

04:28.740 --> 04:29.820
This is very thoughtful.

04:31.790 --> 04:35.430
Okay, let's see where we're at.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.708
Still growing, huh?

04:59.820 --> 05:01.765
DAVID: You gotta be
honest with me, Doc.

05:01.820 --> 05:03.299
We're running out of options.

05:04.390 --> 05:05.641
I can't seem
to get the approval

05:05.690 --> 05:07.772
to have you transferred
for surgery.

05:07.820 --> 05:10.209
Guess you're just gonna
have to cut me open yourself.

05:11.830 --> 05:13.218
I would that I could, it just...

05:13.660 --> 05:14.866
We don't have
the right equipment here.

05:16.270 --> 05:17.828
It's a 45-minute procedure

05:17.880 --> 05:19.780
that takes six months
not to get approved.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.876
-It's absurd.
-How long do I have?

05:23.540 --> 05:24.666
You're not going anywhere.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.795
I have a few patients
I have to see

05:26.840 --> 05:28.102
but I put a call to Oncology

05:28.150 --> 05:29.583
'cause we're gonna
get this handled, okay?

05:29.890 --> 05:31.232
Never give up.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.713
Hmm? Promise me.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.669
Never will.

05:52.130 --> 05:53.438
Sheriff, do you have a sec?

05:53.480 --> 05:54.902
I'd like to run
something by you.

05:55.830 --> 05:56.865
Alone.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.303
Yeah.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.089
We have a small window.
We have a tight schedule.

06:02.620 --> 06:03.837
What is it, Jerry?

06:03.880 --> 06:05.359
LONDON:
I'll get straight to the point.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.131
I'm running for sheriff,

06:07.880 --> 06:09.620
and I'd like your backing
for the job.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.311
I served a number_
of years as undersherlff.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.399
There's no one _ _
more qualified for the posrtlon.

06:14.460 --> 06:15.848
You got a real set on you.

06:15.890 --> 06:17.141
I'll give you that.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.849
Bill, the politics
of this job

06:18.900 --> 06:20.288
doesn't exactly
make you happy.

06:20.330 --> 06:21.319
Everyone can see that.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.586
Being Sheriff takes its toll.

06:22.640 --> 06:23.891
Look what happened to Bradford.

06:23.940 --> 06:25.373
You know what would
make me happy?

06:25.420 --> 06:26.591
-Lettin' me get back to work.
-LONDON: Iwill.

06:26.640 --> 06:27.857
But think about it.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.037
We could spare the department

06:29.080 --> 06:30.854
and the county
an ugly campaign.

06:30.910 --> 06:32.332
Oh, you're gonna
make it ugly, Jerry?

You gonna run?

Yeah, down the hall.

that gun in downstairs.

taking a back seat on this.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.222
You're too close
to the situation.

to start thinking about--

18:16.960 --> 18:19.656
Jerry, if you're telling me
to step aside right now,

18:19.700 --> 18:21.224
you're gonna wake up in Cedars.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.393
It's about Paula.

18:25.710 --> 18:27.314
Paula's what this is about.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.624
And that lady
has leverage on me,

18:30.800 --> 18:32.051
that's very clear.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.142
But they didn't just
keep Paula.

18:37.810 --> 18:39.766
No, they kept
the medical staff, too.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.676

who needs surgery,

18:45.290 --> 18:48.020

They're not gonna hurt Paula

18:50.950 --> 18:52.258

18:54.220 --> 18:56.165
But she can't
give 'em what they want

isn't equipped

18:58.830 --> 19:00.559

They'd have to bring
the patient across the street

19:05.230 --> 19:06.709

operate on him.

to our advantage.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.014

19:48.440 --> 19:49.839

You're serious?

You want me to do

21:12.660 --> 21:14.264
Rose Contreras.

21:21.230 --> 21:22.834
We're gonna save you, babe.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.494
It's all coming together,
just like you said it would.

21:25.890 --> 21:27.585
Where do you wanna go first?

21:27.630 --> 21:28.585
Somewhere without extradition.

21:29.720 --> 21:30.880
Time to get what we need.

21:30.940 --> 21:32.157
You ready to talk
to your husband?

21:33.290 --> 21:34.712
You didn't think we knew?

21:35.290 --> 21:37.679
Honey, we've been
planning this for a minute.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.415
It had to be you.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.595
Let's make that call.

21:43.990 --> 21:45.639
_ I'm_ sure the sheriff's
jonesmg to speak to you.

CADE: All right,
there's no guarantee this camera

21:49.430 --> 21:50.647
gets pointed in the direction
that we need it,

21:50.700 --> 21:51.860
but at the very least
we'll be able

21:51.910 --> 21:53.650
to hear
what's gomg on up there.

21:54.740 --> 21:57.049
LONDON: Bill, this is
Major Timothy Morris,

This is gonna work.

-Are you okay?
-PAULA: I'm okay.

22:09.150 --> 22:11.106
-I'm here.
-Did they hurt you?

22:11.150 --> 22:12.708
No. They-they need me.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.842
BILL:
They want you to do
his surgery, don't they?

22:14.890 --> 22:16.289
PAULA: How'd you know?

22:16.330 --> 22:19.117
You think I got this job
just 'cause of my charm?

22:19.160 --> 22:20.673
I love you, baby.
I'm gettin' you outta there.

22:20.730 --> 22:22.061
I got the equipment they need

22:22.120 --> 22:24.463
and a military surgeon
who can do the job.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.818
You don't need to be
up there anymore.

22:25.860 --> 22:27.373
I can't leave my staff, Bill.

22:27.430 --> 22:28.909
BILL:
The major can keep them safe.

22:28.950 --> 22:30.599
We need to get you out of there.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.902
I'm gonna make a trade
for the release of you

22:32.960 --> 22:34.609
and as many hostages as I can

22:34.650 --> 22:36.299
for the equipment
and the surgeon.

22:36.350 --> 22:39.399
No. Don't send
anyone else up here.

22:39.660 --> 22:40.877
Get whoever you can released,

22:40.920 --> 22:43.707
but if any of my people stay...

22:45.010 --> 22:45.999
so do I.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.573
Paula, this isn't up for debate.

22:47.620 --> 22:48.609
You're coming home.

22:48.670 --> 22:49.830
I'm sorry, Bill.

22:51.930 --> 22:54.626
I can tell you both love
each other very much, Sheriff.

22:54.670 --> 22:56.581
But the other end of
that spectrum is heartbreak,

22:56.630 --> 22:57.938
which is what you're gonna feel

22:57.980 --> 22:59.459
if you don't get us
what we want.

22:59.500 --> 23:00.899
BILL: _
We've got the eqUIpment
that you need.

23:00.940 --> 23:03.374
I'd like to exchange it
for some of the hostages.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.629
It's a sign of good faith.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.409
ROSE:
She can't do the surgery alone

23:07.470 --> 23:08.949
but I'll release
the ones she doesn't need.

23:08.990 --> 23:10.036
How's that sound?

23:11.470 --> 23:12.516
Reasonable.

23:13.910 --> 23:15.298
ROSE:
Release the elevators.

23:15.350 --> 23:16.738
We'll start sending people down.

Move 'em.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.158
-C|ear.
-All right.

23:53.210 --> 23:54.939
Let's get that equipment
loaded up.

23:57.210 --> 23:58.256
Let's go.

24:06.220 --> 24:07.437
Take her up.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.306
Nervous?

24:12.660 --> 24:13.922
I know I'm in good hands.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.099
Propofol should help.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.708
Promise me none of my people
get hurt after this, David.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.060
You have my word.

24:30.460 --> 24:31.631
We don't wanna kill anyone.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.205
If we didn't have to take you,

24:34.250 --> 24:35.148
we wouldn't have.

24:36.250 --> 24:37.330
I'm the sheriff's wife.

Time to get started, Dr. Reyes.

-We have everything we need?
-Yeah.

SHANICE: It's all here.
Most of it's already set up.

All right, scrub in.

CADE:
Our view has been
compromised, Bill.

25:10.980 --> 25:12.538
But don't worry,
we still have audio.

25:13.290 --> 25:14.985
Let's get that wired into comms.

25:29.090 --> 25:30.125
a word.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.088
I need to be clear with you.

25:36.310 --> 25:38.301
Thank you for doing this.

happens to David...

Hey, look at this.

25:59.770 --> 26:01.852
I found two letters
from David's old cellmate

26:01.900 --> 26:03.504
telling him about his daughter.

26:03.560 --> 26:05.551
It came from the same address
as Rose's letters.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.864
They must've crossed paths
when she came
to visit her father.

26:11.130 --> 26:12.472
the sheriff's wife is up there,

and nothing else matters.

26:13.610 --> 26:16.306
Not you, not me, not even him.

26:27.540 --> 26:29.269
She's wasn't planning on

out there anymore.

exactly go on dates,

30:24.340 --> 30:26.558
I got a message for you.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.989
All the hostages

We both know that
when the surgery is over...

30:36.480 --> 30:38.038
you might release the nurses,

30:38.090 --> 30:39.432
but you're not gonna
let my wife go.

30:39.480 --> 30:40.913
You think she's
buying you leverage

right about that.

30:43.920 --> 30:45.228
But if I let you
take Paula with you,

30:45.270 --> 30:47.738
I know I'll never
see her again.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.483
So I'm offering you
a better option.

30:50.630 --> 30:52.621
Take me instead.

30:52.670 --> 30:54.626
I can't live without her,
