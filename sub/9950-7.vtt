00:00.311 --> 00:08.911
Look at me. Look at the Queen.
I was never a fan until I realised
how much we have in common.

00:08.933 --> 00:11.771
Bringing up kiddies you
can't remember the names of.

00:11.773 --> 00:15.171
I know she's not a single parent,
but she might as well be.

00:15.173 --> 00:17.891
Plus the pair of us,
we've stuck to our guns,

00:17.893 --> 00:19.571
her literally, sometimes,

00:19.573 --> 00:21.651
and flagshipped a dying breed.

00:21.653 --> 00:24.091
Admired and despised equally.

00:24.093 --> 00:25.691
Not for never lifting a finger.

00:25.693 --> 00:29.571
No. For setting examples
through extremity.

00:29.573 --> 00:31.811
Whether you're a bigwig
on her end or a bigwig on mine,

00:31.813 --> 00:34.451
you've still got all your dickheads
in the middle to deal with,

00:34.453 --> 00:36.651
snip, snip, snipping
at your benefits.

00:36.653 --> 00:39.091
I mean, she can't not be
looking at me and thinking

00:39.093 --> 00:40.891
"What's your secret, Frank?"

00:40.893 --> 00:43.691
I got shot of my kids yonks back,

00:43.693 --> 00:46.491
whereas she's yet to see
the back of a single one.

00:46.493 --> 00:48.731
Fine! I've had to get
out of bed on occasion to

00:48.733 --> 00:50.291
make ends meet, whereas she,

00:50.293 --> 00:54.293
she's done the whole
thing from a chair.

00:54.653 --> 00:56.211
Oh, and a drink for the lady.

00:56.213 --> 00:58.971
Oh sure, there's perks.
But, look at her lot.

00:58.973 --> 01:01.891
Brian May prancing
about on her roof.

01:01.893 --> 01:03.771
Now look at my lot.

01:03.773 --> 01:07.773
We know how to throw
a proper fucking paartaay!

'"Define love."

01:14.333 --> 01:16.691
'That's what Ol' Big Ears
said on TV.

01:16.693 --> 01:20.411
'Not Noddy's mate,
the future king of England.

'The first warning shot across
18-year-old Diana's bow that all

'If only she'd bailed
there and then, eh?

01:30.453 --> 01:34.091
'It's a tricky concept though, love.

01:34.093 --> 01:37.451
'I've always been
a bit of a romantic, you know.

'I've got a dreamy vision

Who are you going to be?

01:56.173 --> 01:58.011
Hannibal Lecter.

01:58.013 --> 01:59.571
Real, for fuck's sake.

01:59.573 --> 02:01.411
Ronnie Biggs?

02:01.413 --> 02:02.651
That's too tame.

02:02.653 --> 02:04.531
Reggie Kray?

02:04.533 --> 02:08.532
Maybe Jack the Ripper can
beast my ringpiece today?

02:10.092 --> 02:14.093
Shane!

02:14.213 --> 02:17.571
Shane?

02:17.573 --> 02:20.691
Shane!

02:20.693 --> 02:24.091
Salmonella Sam will not
move to that corner plot.

02:24.093 --> 02:25.251
Fat bastard.

02:25.253 --> 02:26.811
Does he know who you are?

02:26.813 --> 02:30.813
He will do, when he's
force-fed his own burgers.

02:31.013 --> 02:32.291
Gi' us five.

02:32.293 --> 02:36.293
Hurry up.

02:41.653 --> 02:43.891
The helium's leaked
from someone's balloon.

02:43.893 --> 02:47.893
Yeah, shagging like a serial killer
often ruins the moment.

02:48.493 --> 02:52.493
You leave me no option.

02:53.333 --> 02:57.331
Eeny, meeny, miny...

Hey, your girlfriend's outside.

03:19.213 --> 03:20.811
She's a mate.

03:20.813 --> 03:23.491
I wouldn't have you down
as nervous with the ladies.

03:23.493 --> 03:27.493
Little stud muffin, our Ches.
Bangs plenty of birds.

03:27.573 --> 03:29.171
We're not even compatible.

03:29.173 --> 03:31.771
Oooh, "compatible!"

03:31.773 --> 03:34.531
What, she's not, er,
blonde and stupid?

03:34.533 --> 03:37.451
And I'm not a lanky brainbox.

03:37.453 --> 03:41.453
One-stop-shop's only a good plan
if they ever get served.

03:53.213 --> 03:57.213
Here. For your strength.

04:11.093 --> 04:13.171
What's that you keep necking?

04:13.173 --> 04:17.173
There are certain questions
you should never ask a lady.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.131
Don't worry, I'll treat you to that.

04:34.133 --> 04:37.531
Oh, thanks.

04:37.533 --> 04:41.533
Â£4.

04:45.093 --> 04:47.451
Are you going to Shane's festival?

04:47.453 --> 04:50.811
I'll be selling scran
on a stall. Are you?

04:50.813 --> 04:54.813
It depends. Letitia and Aiden are.
I was go...

04:57.173 --> 04:58.331
What?

04:58.333 --> 05:00.531
Check the sell-by.

05:00.533 --> 05:01.851
It was the last day.

05:01.853 --> 05:05.853
One day over.

05:09.253 --> 05:12.651
A refund won't clear up
the thrush it's given me.

05:12.653 --> 05:16.411
How's my cider gi...?

05:16.413 --> 05:18.891
Wait there.

05:18.893 --> 05:22.893
Mum.

05:25.973 --> 05:29.411
We were low anyway.

05:29.413 --> 05:33.413
You coming?

05:34.293 --> 05:37.411
Mary Mae?

05:37.413 --> 05:41.413
Huh.

05:43.773 --> 05:46.491
The festival gives him
something to look forward to.

05:46.493 --> 05:49.531
Money well spent if it takes
his mind off his dad for a night.

05:49.533 --> 05:52.491
Hard to get excited when
you've done the legendary gigs.

05:52.493 --> 05:55.291
You know, Pistols
in Free Trade Hall,

05:55.293 --> 05:59.293
Spike Island, Woodstock...

06:01.133 --> 06:03.131
Two Malibus, Mimi.

06:03.133 --> 06:06.011
Scouse Mouse absolutely
smashed it at Creamfields.

06:06.013 --> 06:08.571
Bet he did, at
a hundred grand a gig.

06:08.573 --> 06:11.891
But he's doing this one for his exes.
Northern lad, giving a bit back...

06:11.893 --> 06:13.491
DJs are fucking fraudsters,

06:13.493 --> 06:16.051
robbing a living playing
other people's records.

06:16.053 --> 06:17.411
No wonder he wears a mask.

06:17.413 --> 06:18.811
How many?

06:18.813 --> 06:20.851
2,000 tees, 1,000 hoodies.

06:20.853 --> 06:23.931
You do realise not every single
punter buys a souvenir, Shane?

06:23.933 --> 06:27.251
You never know, do you?
And what's left, we can
just stick online, can't we?

06:27.253 --> 06:29.611
An "I was there" event.

06:29.613 --> 06:32.331
We sold 150 more tickets
this morning.

06:32.333 --> 06:36.333
Promote it and they will come.

06:38.733 --> 06:41.131
How's the stalking going?

06:41.133 --> 06:42.731
You didn't ask him out?

06:42.733 --> 06:45.051
Knew she wouldn't.
Mummy wouldn't approve.

06:45.053 --> 06:47.131
- I was going to, actually, but...
- Course you were.

06:47.133 --> 06:49.131
Can't believe I'm
so embarrassed by it.

06:49.133 --> 06:51.211
I left the playground
two years ago.

06:51.213 --> 06:53.451
Hang on a sec, how long
have you known Chesney?

06:53.453 --> 06:55.971
Almost six months.

06:55.973 --> 06:59.411
Six months is the maximum
you can stay his friend.

06:59.413 --> 07:03.371
After that, there's no chance
of youse going out together.

07:03.373 --> 07:05.171
Is that what happened to us?

07:05.173 --> 07:07.971
You had your chance.
It's now or never.

07:07.973 --> 07:11.973
Those magazines are full of shit.

07:12.173 --> 07:15.291
We've got ten keys of skunk,
two thousand Es,

07:15.293 --> 07:17.971
500 trips. No crack?

07:17.973 --> 07:19.891
Nah, nah, nah. Wrong vibe.

07:19.893 --> 07:21.651
Three key of Charlie.

07:21.653 --> 07:25.011
Our security won't fuck about.
Everyone searched,
everything confiscated.

07:25.013 --> 07:26.691
Plenty of signs to warn them.

07:26.693 --> 07:28.691
They buy off us.

07:28.693 --> 07:31.771
How much to pitch a brothel tent
at this festival of yours?

07:31.773 --> 07:33.571
As much as I back legalisation,

07:33.573 --> 07:35.691
I doubt my license
will stretch that far.

07:35.693 --> 07:37.211
So what? You're selling drugs.

07:37.213 --> 07:40.131
Yeah, which is a lot more discrete
than a tent full of half-naked

07:40.133 --> 07:42.291
birds selling noshes for a score.

07:42.293 --> 07:44.291
What about the police protection?

07:44.293 --> 07:45.771
Huh?

07:45.773 --> 07:47.611
What's she going on about?

07:47.613 --> 07:50.851
He shags his copper,
green lights all the way.

07:50.853 --> 07:52.651
Tell me she's joking.

07:52.653 --> 07:56.653
No hookers allowed.

07:56.973 --> 07:59.211
She's the liaison officer.

07:59.213 --> 08:01.571
She has to be on site, doesn't she?

08:01.573 --> 08:03.371
It's a condition of the license.

08:03.373 --> 08:07.373
I'm not shagging her.

08:18.613 --> 08:20.813
Breathe it in, you worthless scum!

08:23.213 --> 08:27.213
Right in!

08:27.453 --> 08:30.051
Go on, you dirty bitch.

08:30.053 --> 08:31.333
Again.

08:32.852 --> 08:36.731
Tell me how it smells.

08:36.732 --> 08:38.091
Like a...

08:38.092 --> 08:39.533
Yeah...

08:40.732 --> 08:43.173
a mucky, stinking,
pig's arse.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.091
How dirty is it?

08:47.093 --> 08:49.811
Fuck me, yeah, yeah,
it's pretty disgusting.

08:49.813 --> 08:52.731
Louder. Louder...

08:52.733 --> 08:56.171
It's like a dirty,
grassing-slag's brown shithole...

08:56.173 --> 08:58.571
Yeah! Yeah!

08:58.573 --> 09:02.573
Oh, my God. Oh, yeah!

09:12.693 --> 09:16.693
Phew.

09:20.293 --> 09:23.011
Do you ever like it...
like normal sex?

09:23.013 --> 09:24.531
What does that constitute?

09:24.533 --> 09:28.251
I don't know. Just... regular sex?

09:28.253 --> 09:32.253
Naked? No shouting insults,
slapping?

09:32.933 --> 09:36.211
Look, if you're after the cosy
comforts of a generic girlfriend,

09:36.213 --> 09:40.213
you might want to look elsewhere.

09:41.973 --> 09:45.973
I don't want to look elsewhere.

09:49.133 --> 09:51.811
Shane-a-delica's bang
on track, you know.

09:51.813 --> 09:55.813
3,000 tickets almost gone.

09:56.333 --> 10:00.333
Listen, you know Mam and Jamie
are gonna be there, yeah?

10:00.613 --> 10:04.613
Don't worry.
I can be almost invisible.

10:22.613 --> 10:26.613
Forgive him, Father.
He knows not what he does.

10:29.973 --> 10:31.491
You swore you called it off.

10:31.493 --> 10:33.731
I told you, she's all right.

10:33.733 --> 10:36.091
She helped with the
licensing application.

10:36.093 --> 10:39.171
Too right she did!
While they're planning a raid!

10:39.173 --> 10:41.211
No way.

10:41.213 --> 10:43.531
It's a festival.
She knows that means drugs.

10:43.533 --> 10:45.251
She smokes weed.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.611
Wise up, sunshine.

10:46.613 --> 10:49.891
What do you think
that bizzie sees in you?

10:49.893 --> 10:51.931
You wash in a stream!

10:51.933 --> 10:54.731
It doesn't matter if he
bathes in asses' milk.

10:54.733 --> 10:56.811
Maguire. Crime family.

10:56.813 --> 10:59.331
You don't think that
rings any alarm bells?

10:59.333 --> 11:02.291
You think I'm having anything
to do with this festival,

11:02.293 --> 11:05.091
and laying all that gear on,
while you've got an odd lot

11:05.093 --> 11:09.093
in your feather,
you must be off your rocker!

11:11.453 --> 11:13.331
So what are you saying?

11:13.333 --> 11:14.691
You get rid.

11:14.693 --> 11:18.693
Right now.

11:23.493 --> 11:27.493
I don't care what she is.

11:28.213 --> 11:30.564
You don't get to tell me
what to do any more.

11:51.718 --> 11:55.676
I noticed Ken the Dog and his
pit bull sniffing round the field.

11:55.678 --> 11:57.558
I need security.

11:57.626 --> 12:01.064
What about Mimi and Jamie?

12:01.066 --> 12:02.904
They're out.

12:02.906 --> 12:06.906
How come?

12:07.346 --> 12:09.704
I told them about us.

12:09.706 --> 12:11.024
What?!

12:11.026 --> 12:13.006
No more hiding, sneaking around.

12:13.009 --> 12:13.887
Shane!

12:13.889 --> 12:15.607
They thought you were undercover.

12:15.609 --> 12:17.087
How stupid can you be?

12:17.089 --> 12:19.367
What part of undercover
wears a uniform

12:19.369 --> 12:21.447
and drives a car with
a flashing light?

12:21.449 --> 12:22.567
Double bluff?

12:22.569 --> 12:25.807
Fuck's sake.

12:25.809 --> 12:27.127
I thought you'd be happy.

12:27.129 --> 12:29.447
We can be normal now.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.847
Well, obviously keep it on the low
from your side of things but...

12:32.849 --> 12:35.087
What the fuck is it
with you and "normal"?

12:35.089 --> 12:37.327
Normal sex, normal girlfriend.

12:37.329 --> 12:41.329
Jesus.

12:50.089 --> 12:52.807
Ugh! Fucking hanging.
She makes my skin crawl.

12:52.809 --> 12:55.127
She's really pretty, though.

12:55.129 --> 12:56.447
That's garnish.

12:56.449 --> 12:59.327
The only way I'd serve a plod is
by slapping it at the same time.

12:59.329 --> 13:01.247
Maybe he pretends
she's a strip-a-gram?

13:01.249 --> 13:03.127
Or that.

13:03.129 --> 13:04.847
He must be smitten, though.

13:04.849 --> 13:08.849
What a bell end.

13:20.489 --> 13:21.927
What?

13:21.929 --> 13:24.487
A mother's sixth sense
kicks in around boy trouble.

13:24.489 --> 13:27.087
Someone from college, I hope?

13:27.089 --> 13:28.967
As if. She's mad for...

13:28.969 --> 13:32.969
I'm here to talk,
whenever you're ready.

13:35.289 --> 13:37.327
Some sensitive soul, no doubt,

13:37.329 --> 13:41.329
from your English class?

13:48.929 --> 13:50.327
What's wrong with Chesney?

13:50.329 --> 13:52.487
Some out-of-date cider
didn't agree with her.

13:52.489 --> 13:54.767
And she's convinced that
every Asian shopkeeper

13:54.769 --> 13:58.769
launders money from
smuggling heroin.

13:59.329 --> 14:01.687
Sneaky ways to get in his head
and turn him on.

14:01.689 --> 14:04.367
They're full of shit.

14:04.369 --> 14:05.647
It's interesting.

14:05.649 --> 14:09.327
"When a man is scared, testosterone
and adrenalin increase."

14:09.329 --> 14:10.767
It's the same as arousal.

14:10.769 --> 14:12.807
"If a woman's there
when he's frightened,

14:12.809 --> 14:15.527
"he puts the hormone increase
down to her." He fancies her.

14:15.529 --> 14:19.529
So there you go.
Just be there when he shits himself.

14:23.209 --> 14:26.967
Crime And Punishment, one
of the greatest novels of all time.

14:26.969 --> 14:28.327
Notes are at the back.

14:28.329 --> 14:31.609
A shortcut to pretend
you've got a clue about literature.

14:34.129 --> 14:36.607
Looks like someone could use a hand?

14:36.609 --> 14:40.609
Feel free
if you know what you're doing.

14:42.169 --> 14:43.607
Er, I'm next!

14:43.609 --> 14:44.687
Do you pay?

14:44.689 --> 14:47.807
On principle.

14:47.809 --> 14:49.327
Oi-oi-oi!

14:49.329 --> 14:51.407
Staff only back here.

14:51.409 --> 14:54.247
Consider it part of my trial run.

14:54.249 --> 14:57.087
And who says we need an assistant?

14:57.089 --> 15:01.089
If you keep going missing,
they can't serve themselves.

15:02.489 --> 15:06.489
Probationary period only.

15:06.729 --> 15:10.729
And this? Out of bounds.

15:26.769 --> 15:28.607
Thanks for sticking with us.

15:28.609 --> 15:30.927
Beer's legal.

15:30.929 --> 15:33.527
It's going to be mental.
Everyone needs a drink.

15:33.529 --> 15:35.487
No point cutting your nose off
to spite your face.

15:35.489 --> 15:39.489
Their loss.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.287
Aaaaaaahhhhhh!

15:49.289 --> 15:51.289
Who'd rob this dump?

15:57.769 --> 15:59.527
Not the best of signs.

15:59.529 --> 16:03.487
Not everyone's as hard
as our Stella.

16:03.489 --> 16:05.727
Chesney'll shit himself.

16:05.729 --> 16:08.089
Grip you there and then
on the shop floor.

16:12.849 --> 16:14.847
Get on the floor!

16:14.849 --> 16:16.807
Fucking do it!

16:16.809 --> 16:18.607
No one better get hurt.

16:18.609 --> 16:20.287
Assault with a deadly accent?

16:20.289 --> 16:24.289
This stops you getting hurt.

16:24.329 --> 16:26.569
May the force be with you.

16:34.889 --> 16:38.207
I thought Ken the Dog was lifed-off
for killing that plain 'un.

16:38.209 --> 16:40.807
New evidence came to light.

16:40.809 --> 16:42.807
I bet his security don't come cheap.

16:42.809 --> 16:45.047
You get 'em for free if
they do the drug dealing as well.

16:45.049 --> 16:46.247
That's a liberty.

16:46.249 --> 16:48.367
I thought that
was your biggest earner?

16:48.369 --> 16:50.607
Thanks to your dearests,
what choice did I have?

16:50.609 --> 16:54.609
No security, no festival.

16:57.609 --> 16:59.167
Why is that out of bounds?

16:59.169 --> 17:00.847
It's Remona's lab.

17:00.849 --> 17:02.727
What does she need a lab for?

17:02.729 --> 17:06.729
For when she has to concentrate.

17:12.809 --> 17:16.809
I'm off to pray.

17:36.809 --> 17:38.567
Ches!

17:38.569 --> 17:42.569
Like these words aren't long enough.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.327
What?

17:45.329 --> 17:48.367
We just prepare doses of
ready-made pills, creams.

17:48.369 --> 17:50.447
So?

17:50.449 --> 17:52.887
You don't need any of this.

17:52.889 --> 17:55.487
I got a chemistry set one Christmas.
It's a hobby.

17:55.489 --> 17:58.287
Hobbies like this'll
get you banged up.

17:58.289 --> 18:01.487
She's at it, Ches.

18:01.489 --> 18:03.687
If this gets found on your premises,

18:03.689 --> 18:05.607
criminal assets'll take the shop.

18:05.609 --> 18:09.609
Think about it, Chesney.

18:12.169 --> 18:16.169
Patreesha's at the Jockey.
Mind if I wear the coat?

18:21.409 --> 18:24.087
Don't know if it'll work on Ches,
but I'm getting a hard-on.

18:24.089 --> 18:26.087
Just scare him, right?

18:26.089 --> 18:27.887
I'm nervous.

18:27.889 --> 18:31.889
Get in there.

18:53.729 --> 18:55.567
Glad I pulled out of money-lending.

18:55.569 --> 18:59.569
You know. Old women getting whacked.

18:59.609 --> 19:03.609
I did Crime And Punishment
for A-level.

19:04.489 --> 19:07.087
You never said
if you were going to the festival.

19:07.089 --> 19:08.407
Think so.

19:08.409 --> 19:10.967
Letitia's got VIP passes, so...

19:10.969 --> 19:14.969
Great, I'll buy you a drink?

19:15.369 --> 19:16.647
What about the stall?

19:16.649 --> 19:20.287
I'll get Remona or Avril
to cover me.

19:20.289 --> 19:23.687
Is this your way of asking me out?

19:23.689 --> 19:27.689
Might be.

19:28.609 --> 19:30.127
Are you OK?

19:30.129 --> 19:31.367
Mmm...

19:31.369 --> 19:34.527
Don't fucking move!
Over there!

19:34.529 --> 19:35.567
Stop!

19:35.569 --> 19:36.687
Shut the fuck up!

19:36.689 --> 19:39.047
- What do you think you're doing?!
- No! It's OK!

19:39.049 --> 19:40.007
Fucking shut it!

19:40.009 --> 19:41.047
Stop! I mean it!

19:41.049 --> 19:43.607
- Mary Mae, just chill!
- Get on the floor!

19:43.609 --> 19:44.967
Fucking do it!!

19:44.969 --> 19:46.407
I'm not getting on the...

19:46.409 --> 19:47.727
Stay down! Stay there.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.087
It's OK. I'll get you the money.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.207
I'm on it, I'm on it, yeah?

19:52.209 --> 19:56.209
Stay calm, everyone,
just chill, yeah?

20:05.529 --> 20:09.529
That's everything.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.207
That's from my dad!

20:12.209 --> 20:16.167
He wouldn't want it to cause you
any danger.

20:16.169 --> 20:20.087
I'm insured, it's OK.

20:20.089 --> 20:21.807
Look, it's all there, just go!

20:21.809 --> 20:23.047
Now what?

20:23.049 --> 20:24.407
Take it!

20:24.409 --> 20:28.409
Leg it!

20:30.889 --> 20:34.889
Hey, oi! What do
you think you're doing?!

20:38.129 --> 20:42.129
It's OK, it's OK. They've gone.

20:42.329 --> 20:46.329
I've got you.

21:06.769 --> 21:09.607
I'm sorry if I've put it on you.

21:09.609 --> 21:12.047
Just didn't want me mam
fucking it up for us.

21:12.049 --> 21:16.049
You did it for me, didn't you?

21:16.849 --> 21:20.849
It's me lunch break.

21:21.289 --> 21:25.289
And it's my turn
to do something for you.

21:35.369 --> 21:37.847
No, no props.

21:37.849 --> 21:39.207
Serial killers?

21:39.209 --> 21:43.209
No physical abuse.

21:47.009 --> 21:49.167
Nice and steady.

21:49.169 --> 21:53.169
Normal.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.567
You all right?

21:57.569 --> 21:59.807
Uh-huh.

21:59.809 --> 22:03.809
Give us a little tweak
if it helps you.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.247
What the fu...?!

22:18.249 --> 22:22.249
Oh, yeah!

22:22.889 --> 22:26.327
Get fucked!

22:26.329 --> 22:27.967
What is wrong with you?!

22:27.969 --> 22:30.127
Let's forget it, it was a bad idea.

22:30.129 --> 22:34.129
It was a fucking great idea
till your right hook got busy!

22:36.169 --> 22:40.169
No, I said leave it!

22:42.129 --> 22:44.447
At least sniffing your arse
won't leave a bruise, eh?

22:44.449 --> 22:46.407
Fuck off, knobhead.

22:46.409 --> 22:47.607
It was a joke!

22:47.609 --> 22:48.807
Bad fucking taste.

22:48.809 --> 22:50.207
Don't blame me for this!

22:50.209 --> 22:51.887
Doing shit I don't want to do!

22:51.889 --> 22:54.407
Oh, really, because y'know what?

22:54.409 --> 22:57.047
I love a flash of Fred West's kipper

22:57.049 --> 22:59.487
when I'm on the money shot, me,
absolutely love it.

22:59.489 --> 23:01.327
What is wrong with you?

23:01.329 --> 23:04.687
You had to fuck about.

23:04.689 --> 23:06.167
What? What did I do?

23:06.169 --> 23:09.847
Us - it was all right
until you messed it up

23:09.849 --> 23:13.849
with your normal shit.

23:18.209 --> 23:19.672
I can't do this anymore.

23:41.402 --> 23:46.002
Who'd have thought? Biggest
gig of your life just a day away...

23:48.791 --> 23:52.791
Must be serious shit.

23:53.511 --> 23:57.511
Six years with a psycho brass,
now another mad bitch.

23:59.791 --> 24:02.389
What does that say about me?

24:02.391 --> 24:05.789
I look to the mother.

24:05.791 --> 24:09.789
I can't stop fucking craving her.
I'm like some baghead...

24:09.791 --> 24:11.229
Isn't that a good thing?

24:11.231 --> 24:13.669
No, not when it makes you feel worse
after.

24:13.671 --> 24:16.869
Dirty, worthless.

24:16.871 --> 24:18.909
Because she's a copper?

24:18.911 --> 24:21.669
I can live with that.

24:21.671 --> 24:24.509
It's the shit that she says to me,
does to me...

24:24.511 --> 24:26.789
All the fucking filthy,
twisted shit.

24:26.791 --> 24:30.349
Scrapes away my self respect.

24:30.351 --> 24:32.909
That doesn't sound healthy.

24:32.911 --> 24:35.909
She knows the lengths you went to?

24:35.911 --> 24:38.549
Splitting up the family?

24:38.551 --> 24:42.549
I guess some people
you'll never make happy.

24:42.551 --> 24:46.551
You're better off out of it.

24:48.951 --> 24:50.869
I'm not even
arsed about the readies.

24:50.871 --> 24:53.389
There was a locket from her dad
and a watch from mine.

24:53.391 --> 24:57.391
And they were using these toy
thingys to disguise their voices.

24:58.191 --> 25:00.109
They didn't go in there, mate.

25:00.111 --> 25:02.589
An armed gang's targeting
shops across East Manchester,

25:02.591 --> 25:04.869
but this doesn't sound
professional enough.

25:04.871 --> 25:07.749
Probably a couple of desperadoes.
Crackheads.

25:07.751 --> 25:09.229
As ever.

25:09.231 --> 25:12.109
I wouldn't hold out too much
hope on the jewellery.

25:12.111 --> 25:15.349
I'll be in touch.

25:15.351 --> 25:19.351
See you later.

25:21.391 --> 25:23.589
I can't believe he actually
fucking shit himself!

25:23.591 --> 25:25.229
You had the gun in his face!

25:25.231 --> 25:26.829
What the fuck was that?!

25:26.831 --> 25:29.589
- It was good, wasn't it?
He proper shit himself.
- Guns?!

25:29.591 --> 25:30.869
Yeah, that was my idea.

25:30.871 --> 25:32.069
Then you're an idiot.

25:32.071 --> 25:34.629
Well, we had to make it look real
to get him in the mood.

25:34.631 --> 25:36.469
Yeah, and you had to take
all his money too?

25:36.471 --> 25:38.469
How were we meant to know
he'd be such a loser?

25:38.471 --> 25:40.589
"Oh, just take it, please.
Take everything!"

25:40.591 --> 25:43.069
Only to protect me!
Well, where is it?

25:43.071 --> 25:46.029
You'll have to give it all back.

25:46.031 --> 25:48.949
Tell me you haven't...

25:48.951 --> 25:52.951
Well, give me your share at least.

25:53.231 --> 25:55.069
You let her spend it on those?

25:55.071 --> 25:56.389
And Chesney's the loser?

25:56.391 --> 25:57.709
I've got this.

25:57.711 --> 25:59.629
He's getting that back.

25:59.631 --> 26:03.631
Slow down! Let me
get my dabs off first.

26:05.271 --> 26:07.069
Where you going to say you got it?

26:07.071 --> 26:08.629
We're going out for a drink tonight.

26:08.631 --> 26:09.909
So it worked!

26:09.911 --> 26:13.029
He asked me out before you two
came in and fucked it all up.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.069
Oh.

26:14.071 --> 26:15.989
So you're going out
tonight for a drink

26:15.991 --> 26:17.589
and you're going to tell him what?

26:17.591 --> 26:18.389
The truth.

26:18.391 --> 26:22.391
You can't do that. It was your idea
as well. We're all in this together.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.189
We were in this together

26:24.191 --> 26:28.029
until you came in started waving
guns about, nearly gave Chesney

26:28.031 --> 26:32.031
a heart attack, and then spent
all his money on fucking trainers!

26:33.391 --> 26:37.391
I'm telling him tonight.

26:40.231 --> 26:43.469
Fuck!

26:43.471 --> 26:44.989
Who the fuck wants karaoke anyway

26:44.991 --> 26:46.629
when we've got
all these DJs playing?

26:46.631 --> 26:49.109
All the best festivals mix it up.

26:49.111 --> 26:50.909
Different stages, tents.

26:50.911 --> 26:52.749
Are they even going to be
able to hear it?

26:52.751 --> 26:55.349
Stop rabbitting!

26:55.351 --> 26:58.549
Ah, you fucking...

26:58.551 --> 27:02.551
bell end!

27:19.071 --> 27:20.389
Canine Ken...

27:20.391 --> 27:22.669
That slag you're shagging
didn't look too happy.

27:22.671 --> 27:25.709
Was shagging. Not that it's fuck
all to do with you.

27:25.711 --> 27:27.109
Don't be fucking smart.

27:27.111 --> 27:29.469
You're supposed to have immunity,
police protection!

27:29.471 --> 27:32.509
You've got it to yourself,
you'll smash it.

27:32.511 --> 27:36.069
I need better odds
before my boys enter the fray.

27:36.071 --> 27:38.389
And I need security.

27:38.391 --> 27:42.149
Good luck finding some other nugget
to send his men over the top.

27:42.151 --> 27:46.151
You're going to
do your bollocks on this.

27:50.591 --> 27:53.349
Ken!

27:53.351 --> 27:55.269
Ken!

27:55.271 --> 27:59.271
Ken!

28:04.631 --> 28:08.631
Fuck.

28:11.511 --> 28:13.989
If you're up to no good,
I want a piece.

28:13.991 --> 28:16.669
Somebody's jumping to conclusions.

28:16.671 --> 28:18.509
One of us knows what this is.

28:18.511 --> 28:21.469
Go on, then.

28:21.471 --> 28:25.471
Mixing that with that gives the base
mix for 4-methylmethcathinone

28:26.951 --> 28:29.949
MACT? Miaow miaow on the street?

28:29.951 --> 28:31.629
Come on!

28:31.631 --> 28:33.949
Those police came in here,
he'd lose the shop!

28:33.951 --> 28:37.469
It's 5-methylmethcathinone oxide...

28:37.471 --> 28:38.509
Which is?

28:38.511 --> 28:41.229
All for me. And only me.

28:41.231 --> 28:45.149
Shifting four molecules creates
an even mellower high

28:45.151 --> 28:46.949
that's perfectly legal.

28:46.951 --> 28:49.829
- I'll buy all you've got after today.
- No chance.

28:49.831 --> 28:53.789
The government make something else
illegal, it's my move.

28:53.791 --> 28:55.909
Stay one step ahead.

28:55.911 --> 28:59.911
No dealing, no murky netherworld.
Just my own supply.

29:14.951 --> 29:16.829
I hope you come in peace.

29:16.831 --> 29:18.669
Thanks. Not on duty.

29:18.671 --> 29:22.189
Can't we get a replacement officer?

29:22.191 --> 29:24.629
Well, you're not content
with scaring the security off,

29:24.631 --> 29:27.309
you fucked with his head
as well. Jeopardised everything.

29:27.311 --> 29:29.389
One minute I'm being shoved
under the covers,

29:29.391 --> 29:30.789
now you're his agony aunt?

29:30.791 --> 29:32.749
Shane's a very private man.

29:32.751 --> 29:35.989
Divulging his pain must be a measure
of how much you mean to him.

29:35.991 --> 29:38.149
You make it sound like
there's a simple solution.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.389
There is.

29:39.391 --> 29:43.229
You take your aromatic arsehole
and get out of his life?

29:43.231 --> 29:44.629
Like you've any idea.

29:44.631 --> 29:48.631
Any idea what he's
put on the line for you? A Maguire?

29:49.031 --> 29:53.031
The gangster, macho, bullshit world
he's from shagging a copper?!

29:53.471 --> 29:56.749
That gets even less respect than
growing a handlebar moustache

29:56.751 --> 30:00.751
and sucking off random
cocks for a tenner on Canal Street.

30:15.911 --> 30:18.269
My favourite sister-in-law
fancy joining me?

30:18.271 --> 30:19.869
The inmates are getting restless.

30:19.871 --> 30:21.909
Billy's had to take a petrol
can off one of 'em -

30:21.911 --> 30:23.791
thought he was going
to burn the stage.

30:25.151 --> 30:26.951
There's a mutiny brewing!

30:28.751 --> 30:30.229
They'll all get refunds.

30:30.231 --> 30:32.869
Come on, Shane. You get a grip.

30:32.871 --> 30:35.709
No security, Kaz, no festival.

30:35.711 --> 30:37.189
The police'll shut us down.

30:37.191 --> 30:38.949
So you haven't sorted it?

30:38.951 --> 30:41.669
Ken the Dog put the word out
and naused the whole of Manchester.

30:41.671 --> 30:45.671
Leeds? London? Come on,
he can't be that influential?

30:45.791 --> 30:48.429
Maybe if there was more time.

30:48.431 --> 30:51.229
Right. Come on.

30:51.231 --> 30:55.231
I want to show you something.

31:04.191 --> 31:05.629
Breathe it in.

31:05.631 --> 31:08.709
That's what she says with
my nose stuck right up her arse.

31:08.711 --> 31:09.709
Eew, dirty bitch.

31:09.711 --> 31:10.909
That's what I say.

31:10.911 --> 31:14.829
Enough.

31:14.831 --> 31:17.589
Look how far it stretches.

31:17.591 --> 31:20.389
Fatboy Slim started somewhere.

31:20.391 --> 31:23.589
All those man hours.
All the commerce.

31:23.591 --> 31:26.549
All the wages that are being earned.

31:26.551 --> 31:30.551
Not to mention the buzz that's
on Chatsworth. All down to you.

31:33.191 --> 31:37.191
I appreciate the vision, but we're
fucked regardless.

31:39.911 --> 31:43.911
It all ends here.

31:43.991 --> 31:46.549
Do you stand by your copper?

31:46.551 --> 31:47.989
All day.

31:47.991 --> 31:51.991
Convinced there's no double-cross,
sting operation?

31:52.311 --> 31:56.311
She wouldn't do that.

31:56.831 --> 32:00.831
Come on.

32:05.911 --> 32:06.949
Whoa!

32:06.951 --> 32:10.951
Sorry. Getting more like a scared
rabbit as the night wears on.

32:11.951 --> 32:13.429
Could be delayed shock.

32:13.431 --> 32:16.989
Nah, I was OK before.
Now I can't stop thinking about it.

32:16.991 --> 32:20.991
Yeah, it's a big deal though -
like post traumatic stress disorder.

32:21.871 --> 32:24.789
I get dead worried now
when she's late.

32:24.791 --> 32:27.429
She's got to leave
that sick bastard.

32:27.431 --> 32:30.029
Lays one more finger on her
I swear...

32:30.031 --> 32:31.189
She's here.

32:31.191 --> 32:34.069
Driver on the 105 got
carted off by the police.

32:34.071 --> 32:37.749
Micro camera on the step sending
panty pics of schoolgirls

32:37.751 --> 32:41.751
and grannies to his smartphone.

32:41.831 --> 32:44.749
Present off Biddy for understanding
all that he's going through.

32:44.751 --> 32:46.869
He's going through?!

32:46.871 --> 32:50.871
20 years on that darts team to
be binned like an old flight.

32:51.431 --> 32:55.431
Engraved. You ever get anything that
spontaneous off your Kev?

32:55.511 --> 32:57.829
Not apart from a dose...

32:57.831 --> 32:58.789
Drink?

32:58.791 --> 33:00.671
Yeah. Yeah.

33:03.031 --> 33:07.031
Fuck's sake. This is hard work.

33:07.311 --> 33:09.509
I know we said meal...

33:09.511 --> 33:12.909
but I might need a bit of quiet.

33:12.911 --> 33:14.509
Not that I'm pushing or anything...

33:14.511 --> 33:16.509
Oh, no, that'd be lovely.

33:16.511 --> 33:20.511
Cos there's something
I need to tell you.

33:21.111 --> 33:25.069
Couple more of these should sort
out my Parkinson's.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.469
Ches...

33:26.471 --> 33:28.709
Listen, I really need to tell you...

33:28.711 --> 33:30.189
Hello.

33:30.191 --> 33:32.509
What?

33:32.511 --> 33:33.989
Woof woof.

33:33.991 --> 33:35.429
What does that do?

33:35.431 --> 33:38.309
Ramona wolfs it down
so it can't be that strong.

33:38.311 --> 33:42.311
Says it takes the edge off.

33:45.591 --> 33:46.709
Cheers.

33:46.711 --> 33:50.711
Cheers.

33:54.471 --> 33:58.471
Eh, Squirrel Nutkin must be
bored in his woodland glade?

34:06.351 --> 34:09.989
However many security that buys me.

34:09.991 --> 34:11.349
Where's Ken the Dog?

34:11.351 --> 34:12.989
Doesn't matter.

34:12.991 --> 34:14.549
So who's doing the drugs?

34:14.551 --> 34:15.949
Nobody.

34:15.951 --> 34:18.589
It'll be a free for all.

34:18.591 --> 34:20.909
As long as I've got security
to cover the main gates

34:20.911 --> 34:23.509
and crowd control,
it doesn't matter.

34:23.511 --> 34:27.511
With no drug sales you'll lose
out on money, mate.

34:29.751 --> 34:32.309
Is your bird going to be there?

34:32.311 --> 34:34.509
That's over.

34:34.511 --> 34:36.149
Sense at last.

34:36.150 --> 34:39.429
But she'll be on site.

34:39.431 --> 34:41.829
You trust her?

34:41.831 --> 34:45.831
You fucking better!

34:48.791 --> 34:52.791
What's the problem?

34:55.951 --> 34:58.669
Only if we get to keep the lot.

34:58.671 --> 35:02.469
No problem.

35:02.471 --> 35:05.269
You need to earn some sort of drink
for all the effort you've put in.

35:05.271 --> 35:07.349
What I need is security.

35:07.351 --> 35:11.351
You've got them.

35:15.151 --> 35:16.384
Drink?

35:41.573 --> 35:43.371
I'll refrain from offering
a cup of tea

35:43.373 --> 35:46.651
till you explain the dress code.

35:46.653 --> 35:48.371
I'm really sorry.

35:48.373 --> 35:50.531
What were you doing?!

35:50.533 --> 35:54.533
I can't really remember.

35:56.773 --> 36:00.773
Sorry.

36:08.693 --> 36:12.693
I said they were mine!

36:16.453 --> 36:20.453
Ow!

36:30.933 --> 36:32.051
Did you shag him?

36:32.053 --> 36:34.611
Did you tell him?

36:34.613 --> 36:37.931
Erm... No. Yes.

36:37.933 --> 36:40.331
I think I did.

36:40.333 --> 36:41.491
Shit.

36:41.493 --> 36:44.251
Nice one!
No wonder he didn't shag you.

36:44.253 --> 36:46.771
We were proper fucked.

36:46.773 --> 36:50.773
I can't really remember... much.

36:53.333 --> 36:56.091
So you might not have told him?

36:56.093 --> 36:59.491
Have you still got the watch?

36:59.493 --> 37:01.891
- Fuck's sake.
- What did he say this morning?

37:01.893 --> 37:03.571
Is he going to call the police?

37:03.573 --> 37:05.293
I didn't see him this morning.

37:07.933 --> 37:11.771
Text from Mum, "You're dead".

37:11.773 --> 37:14.371
He's told her. Great!

37:14.373 --> 37:17.491
Let's go.

37:17.493 --> 37:21.493
He's proper going to hate me.

37:21.533 --> 37:22.651
She's ringing.

37:22.653 --> 37:23.853
Come on!

37:30.973 --> 37:32.131
Avril.

37:32.133 --> 37:33.411
Pick up!

37:33.413 --> 37:34.451
Please, Avril.

37:34.453 --> 37:35.771
Wait till I get my hands on her.

37:35.773 --> 37:36.691
Don't make it worse!

37:36.693 --> 37:38.171
She could've got herself shot!

37:38.173 --> 37:39.211
They were toy guns!

37:39.213 --> 37:41.651
The police? Mistakes?
It happens all the time.

37:41.653 --> 37:43.451
She knows I'm a liar,
thinks I'm stupid,

37:43.453 --> 37:44.891
don't make me a grass as well.

37:44.893 --> 37:48.893
Sorry, Ches.

37:57.413 --> 37:58.691
Shane warned you.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.051
I'm here for the music!

38:00.053 --> 38:01.131
He can't take the risk!

38:01.133 --> 38:02.251
I want a refund!

38:02.253 --> 38:06.253
Do one, Lillian!

38:12.133 --> 38:14.531
Oh, shit, another text
from Mum -

38:14.533 --> 38:16.451
"You can't hide for ever."

38:16.453 --> 38:18.891
- Well, at least
he hasn't told the police.
- He wouldn't.

38:18.893 --> 38:20.491
You've got to admit, it was easy.

38:20.493 --> 38:22.731
It's not really a viable career
path though.

38:22.733 --> 38:25.691
Just go and talk to him!
At least we'd know where we stand.

38:25.693 --> 38:29.491
I'm too embarrassed to think
about it.

38:29.493 --> 38:32.131
What time's Scouse Mouse on?

38:32.133 --> 38:33.451
âª Hey, big spender! âª

38:33.453 --> 38:37.251
At last. Bonnie and Snide.

38:37.253 --> 38:41.253
Had a productive day?

38:48.293 --> 38:49.731
What you doing back here?

38:49.733 --> 38:52.491
Party of the century, get involved!
Do you want a pill?

38:52.493 --> 38:53.651
Nah, you're all right.

38:53.653 --> 38:57.653
You're messing with my mojo!

38:59.173 --> 39:02.251
I've fucked things up. With a boy.

39:02.253 --> 39:04.451
Who?

39:04.453 --> 39:05.491
Chesney.

39:05.493 --> 39:07.491
Fuck off! You're well too fit
for him!

39:07.493 --> 39:09.211
What could you do to put him off?

39:09.213 --> 39:13.213
I got Letitia and Aidan
to rob his shop. With guns.

39:14.933 --> 39:18.011
So? He'll forgive you. Men are easy.

39:18.013 --> 39:21.331
Shane's been shagging a fucking pig.
All you've done is armed robbery.

39:21.333 --> 39:25.333
You'll be sweet.

39:31.693 --> 39:35.411
Cheers, nice one.

39:35.413 --> 39:37.091
A couple of volunteers.

39:37.093 --> 39:38.251
I could do with it.

39:38.253 --> 39:41.451
Here, and at the shop,
till they pay every penny off.

39:41.453 --> 39:42.891
Mary Mae not coming?

39:42.893 --> 39:44.011
She's on the karaoke.

39:44.013 --> 39:45.291
I'll get her.

39:45.293 --> 39:49.293
No, no. It's OK.

39:51.533 --> 39:55.533
She's still mad for you.

39:58.333 --> 40:00.251
âª On the day that you were born

40:00.253 --> 40:02.571
âª The angels got together

40:02.573 --> 40:06.573
âª And decided to create
a dream come true

40:06.893 --> 40:10.491
âª So they sprinkled moon dust
in your hair...âª

40:10.493 --> 40:11.811
I'm sorry.

40:11.813 --> 40:15.813
I'm sorry.

40:18.733 --> 40:22.571
âª And I get sick when I'm around

40:22.573 --> 40:26.371
âª I can't stand to be around

40:26.373 --> 40:30.373
âª I hate everything about you

40:32.813 --> 40:36.813
âª Everything about you! âª

40:41.693 --> 40:43.251
What time's Scouse Mouse on?

40:43.253 --> 40:44.331
Not long.

40:44.333 --> 40:45.531
Are we getting it?

40:45.533 --> 40:49.533
We're doing good.

40:49.733 --> 40:53.411
I tell you what, this gaff's run
sweet as a nut tonight.

40:53.413 --> 40:55.411
Whoa, whoa. Feds, three o'clock.

40:55.413 --> 40:59.413
Told you to stay offside!

41:03.133 --> 41:04.571
Done good. Well done.

41:04.573 --> 41:05.691
Appreciate it.

41:05.693 --> 41:08.211
I knew you would.

41:08.213 --> 41:10.251
Haven't you got a job to do?

41:10.253 --> 41:13.451
It's all going well.
Everyone happy.

41:13.453 --> 41:16.651
Everything self-contained.

41:16.653 --> 41:17.851
Discretion applied

41:17.853 --> 41:21.171
and a blind eye turned
regarding certain, expected,

41:21.173 --> 41:25.173
festival behaviour.

41:30.813 --> 41:34.813
Ugh!

41:40.533 --> 41:41.651
I'm sorry.

41:41.653 --> 41:45.653
Me too.

42:06.413 --> 42:09.571
Don't be scared.

42:09.573 --> 42:11.611
I can't help it.

42:11.613 --> 42:15.613
Trust me.

42:47.293 --> 42:49.853
'Give it up for Scouse Mouse!'

42:52.533 --> 42:54.691
How did you know?

42:54.693 --> 42:57.891
Know what?

42:57.893 --> 43:01.893
That it would be that good?

43:01.933 --> 43:05.933
I wish I could claim the credit.

43:06.253 --> 43:08.731
So honest and pure.

43:08.733 --> 43:12.733
Thank you.

43:16.173 --> 43:20.173
'If it's right, love...

43:21.293 --> 43:25.293
'you nurture each other's hopes and
encourage one another's ambitions.

43:26.933 --> 43:30.933
'You're always there to pick up your
true love when he or she stumbles.

43:32.693 --> 43:36.411
'The vast majority fall short of
those youthful dreams and we won't

'get to play for United, or win

43:40.053 --> 43:44.053
'But that's all right,

'Our happiness is defined
in more wholesome ways.'

43:47.933 --> 43:50.251
Master of all he surveys.

43:50.253 --> 43:54.253
Thanks to you.

43:57.733 --> 44:00.691
Do you reckon Jamie would
sniff my arse?

44:00.693 --> 44:02.531
Be a fool not to.

44:02.533 --> 44:06.331
Glastonbury, watch out.

44:06.333 --> 44:10.333
'It's built around family
and old friends and loyalty.

44:12.773 --> 44:16.773
'And if we're lucky, that

44:27.653 --> 44:29.291
'Hi, erm, it's me,

44:29.293 --> 44:32.171
'just wanted to say thanks
for last night.

44:32.173 --> 44:34.811
'I just want to say
I've been thinking about you.

44:34.813 --> 44:36.771
'I can't tell you how much
you mean to me.

44:36.773 --> 44:39.371
'Did I thank you for last night?
I can't wait to be with you.

44:39.373 --> 44:41.131
'I've never felt this
way about anyone.

44:41.133 --> 44:44.571
'Hi, big boy, it's me.
I really need to speak to you.

44:44.573 --> 44:47.811
'Oh, my God, I'm going crazy.
I miss you so much.

44:47.813 --> 44:49.451
'Bye, love you.

44:49.453 --> 44:51.651
'..That'd be nice, thank you.

44:51.653 --> 44:53.571
'Mwah!

44:53.573 --> 44:56.051
'Give me a call!

44:56.053 --> 44:59.091
'I've decided that
this is our song.

44:59.093 --> 45:02.531
'I'm going to turn it up.'

45:02.533 --> 45:03.571
Lip!

45:03.573 --> 45:04.971
Frank?

45:04.973 --> 45:06.011
It's Lip.

45:06.013 --> 45:07.331
Lip, like my brother, Lip?

45:07.333 --> 45:09.451
Uncle Jamie,
were you ever in the Scouts?

45:09.453 --> 45:11.451
I'm more of a leader than
a follower.

45:11.453 --> 45:14.171
You made him feel like a twat
so he acted like one.

45:14.173 --> 45:16.251
Lip Gallagher, all grown up.

45:16.253 --> 45:17.451
Welcome home.

45:17.453 --> 45:19.011
You look different now.

45:19.013 --> 45:21.171
Got your Chatsworth on! Whay!

45:21.173 --> 45:23.011
Katie, run now!

45:23.013 --> 45:25.171
I should've never brought her here.

45:25.173 --> 45:26.291
Look at the state of you!

45:26.293 --> 45:28.585
You've been back 48 hours

Mate, bring the Bentley.
Get me out of this fucking shithole.

Would you sign my tits, Mr Mouse?
