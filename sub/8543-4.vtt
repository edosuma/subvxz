RAN THE FAMILY.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.292
HE DIED A LONG TIME AGO
OF CANCER.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.120
WAS HUFF
IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS?

10:43.164 --> 10:44.600
NO. NO WAY.

10:44.644 --> 10:48.648
UM, HIS MOM WAS JUST
A KID WHEN SHE HAD HIM,

10:48.691 --> 10:52.739
AND AS SOON AS SHE SAW WHAT KIND
OF MAN TOM OVERTON WAS,

10:52.782 --> 10:54.784
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.743
SHE RAISED HIM ON HER OWN

10:56.786 --> 10:58.570
WITHOUT A PENNY
OF OVERTON MONEY.

10:58.614 --> 11:01.225

EVEN SHOWED UP AT THE FUNERAL,

11:07.362 --> 11:09.581
SO... NO,

11:09.625 --> 11:11.627
HE WASN'T CLOSE WITH THEM.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.629

11:27.338 --> 11:29.689
NOW THEY FOCUS ON ILLEGAL
PRESCRIPTIONS AND METH.

THAT RUNS THROUGH TOWN

BETWEEN THEIR TURFS.

11:48.533 --> 11:49.665

THEY WOULD COME TO PEACE.

SAW HIM AS, UH, AN OVERTON,

11:58.587 --> 12:00.154
DECIDED TO TAKE HIM OUT.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.677

NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FAMILY,

12:01.721 --> 12:03.026

ALL'S FAIR IN WAR.

12:06.073 --> 12:07.727

A FEW DAYS OLD.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.269

OVER THE NEW TURF?

21:35.772 --> 21:37.687
I SAID WHAT I GOTTA SAY.

21:37.731 --> 21:40.299

29:51.833 --> 29:53.356
WHOLE GANG.

29:53.400 --> 29:58.709
BUT HE NEEDS TO KNOW THAT WHEN
THE OTHER LOW-RIDERS GO DOWN,

29:58.753 --> 30:00.537
YOU WILL GIVE HIM A JOB.

30:00.581 --> 30:01.843
WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU?

30:01.887 --> 30:03.889
WELL, I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL,

30:03.932 --> 30:05.804
I'M JUST SAYING
YOU'LL GIVE THE GUY A JOB.

30:05.847 --> 30:08.719
DOING WHAT, I DON'T--
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

30:08.763 --> 30:10.330
THIS IS A BUNCH OF CRAP.

30:10.373 --> 30:13.942
THE LOW-RIDERS HAVE ORDERED
A SUBSTANTIAL SUPPLY OF GUNS.

30:13.986 --> 30:18.251
THE SUPPLIER'S SUPPOSED TO
ARRIVE AT NOON TODAY.

30:18.294 --> 30:19.600
WHAT KIND OF GUNS?

30:19.643 --> 30:21.950
I DON'T KNOW.
I-I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT GUNS.

30:21.994 --> 30:24.300
ALL I'M ASKING IS THAT
YOU CHECK IT OUT.

30:24.344 --> 30:27.564
IF THE INFORMATION IS CORRECT,
YOU GIVE THIS GUY A SHOT.

30:27.608 --> 30:29.392
I WANT TO MEET HIM.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.481

BE DIFFICULT.

30:33.353 --> 30:35.659
I WANT TO MEET HIM,
OR THERE'S NO DEAL!

30:35.703 --> 30:38.271
OKAY. WELL...

30:38.314 --> 30:40.839
WELL, I WILL SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

WELL, IT MEANS OUR INFORMANT

31:26.667 --> 31:28.799

IS TELLING THE TRUTH.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.889
SO HE'S PART OF THEIR FAMILY? [video game gunfire on TV]

31:30.932 --> 31:32.934
AND HE'LL GIVE THEM ALL UP

31:32.978 --> 31:34.675
AS LONG AS I PROMISE
TO HOOK HIM UP AFTERWARDS?

31:34.718 --> 31:36.895
THAT'S THE DEAL.

31:36.938 --> 31:38.809
I WANT TO MEET HIM.

31:38.853 --> 31:40.289

THEN FORGET IT.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.814

WHAT I CAN DO.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.947
HEY, BOSS.
THERE'S SOME DUDE OUT BACK

31:45.991 --> 31:47.906

32:12.974 --> 32:15.759
HEY, GUYS!
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

32:15.803 --> 32:17.283
FOLLOW ME.

32:22.418 --> 32:24.899
THIS BETTER NOT BE
A WASTE OF MY TIME.

32:30.992 --> 32:41.002
WE'RE NOT OFF

32:50.055 --> 32:52.187
HAS IT STARTED YET?

32:52.231 --> 32:53.536
IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.016
YOU SHOULD BE AT HOME.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.017
I'M HERE.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.063
YOU SURE?

32:58.106 --> 33:00.065
YEAH.

33:02.502 --> 33:04.025
THEY SHOULD ALL BE
IN THE OFFICE BY NOW.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.070

33:07.855 --> 33:09.204
ALL RIGHT. EVERYBODY
SETTLE DOWN.

33:09.248 --> 33:10.945
WE'RE NOT
GONNA DO THIS HERE.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.729
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE GONNA BUST THEM.

33:12.773 --> 33:15.080
YEAH, WELL, UH, I-I TOLD THEM

33:15.123 --> 33:16.907
EXACTLY THE SAME THING
ABOUT YOU.

33:16.951 --> 33:19.649
UH, BIG LIE ON MY PART.
I'M SORRY.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.825
JUST NEEDED TO GET THE TWO
OF YOU IN A ROOM TOGETHER.

33:21.869 --> 33:23.131
WHY?

33:23.175 --> 33:24.959
TO STOP THE FEUD
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS KILLED.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.047
YOU KNOW MOSS?

33:26.091 --> 33:28.049
LISTEN, MY GYM
IS NEUTRAL GROUND.

33:28.093 --> 33:29.094
YOU'RE SAFE HERE.

33:30.138 --> 33:31.313

33:31.357 --> 33:32.662
AND, LET'S FACE IT,

33:32.706 --> 33:35.056
YOU GUYS ARE ACTING
LIKE A COUPLE OF KIDS.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.102
A SIT-DOWN.

33:37.145 --> 33:39.017
THAT'S THE IDEA.
GIVE IT A TRY.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.975
IF IT DOESN'T WORK,
GO NUTS,

33:41.019 --> 33:42.324
SHOOT EACH OTHER
ALL YOU LIKE,

33:42.368 --> 33:44.022
JUST NOT WHEN I'M THERE.

33:44.065 --> 33:47.721
WHAT THE HELL?

33:50.376 --> 33:52.030
[Lisbon] LET'S GO.

33:54.206 --> 33:55.729
OKAY.

34:04.216 --> 34:06.087
YOU LIE, WOMAN.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.263
THAT PARK WAS OPEN TURF.

34:08.306 --> 34:09.786
THEN WE SEND MY GUYS
DOWN THERE,

34:09.830 --> 34:10.786
YOUR BOYS JUMPED HIM.

34:10.831 --> 34:12.833
OPEN TURF?
THAT PARK IS MINE.

34:12.876 --> 34:15.270
SO YOU PAID A PRICE
FOR TRESPASSING,

34:15.313 --> 34:17.793
AND YOU KILL MY NEPHEW
FOR PAYBACK?

34:17.838 --> 34:20.362
I KNOW FOR A FACT YOU PULLED
THAT TRIGGER YOURSELF.

34:20.406 --> 34:22.016
YOU ARE
ONE CRAZY OLD LADY.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.539
YOU SCUM COULD NEVER
LEARN YOUR PLACE.

34:23.583 --> 34:27.065
I HAVE GIVEN YOU
THE EAST--YOU AIN'T GIVEN ME NOTHING!

34:27.108 --> 34:29.371
OKAY?

34:29.415 --> 34:31.156
WHO TOLD YOU I PULLED
THE TRIGGER ON YOUR NEPHEW?

34:31.199 --> 34:32.157
THIS ISN'T HOW YOU DO IT.

34:32.199 --> 34:33.375

ABOUT PEACE,

LET'S--LET'S DWELL ON IT.
IT'S ALL VERY GOOD.

34:37.510 --> 34:38.728
YOU'RE DOING A LOT
OF TALKING,

34:38.772 --> 34:40.165
YOU'RE NOT DOING
A LOT OF LISTENING.

34:40.208 --> 34:41.382
LET'S TAKE
THE PARK SITUATION.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.081
BELTRAN, YOU SAID
THAT IT WAS OPEN TURF.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.387
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

34:45.431 --> 34:46.996
I GOT MY SOURCES.

34:47.041 --> 34:48.737
WELL, IN THIS CASE,
YOUR SOURCE WAS WRONG, HUH?

34:48.782 --> 34:50.739
WHO'S YOUR SOURCE?

34:50.784 --> 34:52.829
THAT'S NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS.

34:52.873 --> 34:56.224
AND WHO TOLD YOU FOR A FACT
THAT BELTRAN KILLED HUFF?

35:03.144 --> 35:04.580

35:09.977 --> 35:12.110
NOW WHEN YOU TWO
CRIMINAL GENIUSES

35:12.153 --> 35:13.720
ARE DONE KILLING EACH OTHER,

35:13.763 --> 35:15.591
MR. MOSS HERE
AND HIS NEW GANG

35:15.635 --> 35:17.027

35:17.071 --> 35:18.420
[Beltran] SON OF A BITCH.

35:18.464 --> 35:21.249
YOU KILLED MY NEPHEW,
AND YOU BLAMED IT ON BELTRAN.

35:24.818 --> 35:26.602
YOU'VE GOT THIS WRONG.

35:26.646 --> 35:28.778

IF I WERE YOU.

WITH YOUR PAID SUSPENSION.

37:31.118 --> 37:32.424
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

37:52.748 --> 37:54.533

37:57.362 --> 38:01.366

FILE IT AND FORGET IT.

38:01.409 --> 38:02.410
YOU KNOW--YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE?

38:02.454 --> 38:05.935
IT'S LIKE COOKING
A BEAUTIFUL MEAL

38:05.979 --> 38:08.677
AND PUTTING IT STRAIGHT
IN THE REFRIGERATOR...

38:08.721 --> 38:10.288
FOREVER.

38:10.331 --> 38:11.593
YOU COULD HELP.

38:11.637 --> 38:13.726
NO, I COULDN'T.

38:15.554 --> 38:19.253
SO... WHAT'S YOUR REPORT
GONNA SAY?

38:19.297 --> 38:22.604
IT WILL SAY THAT AGENT RIGSBY
ACTED APPROPRIATELY

38:22.648 --> 38:26.782
AND WITH SOUND JUDGMENT
WHEN HE USED LETHAL FORCE

38:26.826 --> 38:29.394
AGAINST MOSS.

38:29.437 --> 38:31.396
GOOD WORK.

38:31.439 --> 38:32.788
YOU GOT AWAY WITH IT.

38:32.832 --> 38:33.789
ME?

38:33.833 --> 38:35.617
WELL, I CAN'T MAKE A CASE,

38:35.661 --> 38:37.967
BUT YOU CHOSE A REMOTE
LOCATION FOR THE MEETING,

38:38.011 --> 38:40.753
YOU SET UP A SITUATION
WHERE MOSS HAD TO FLEE.

38:40.796 --> 38:43.233
AND THERE, BY CHANCE,

38:43.277 --> 38:44.931
WAS RIGSBY.

38:44.974 --> 38:46.236
[laughs]

38:46.280 --> 38:47.934
WELL, I'M--I'M FLATTERED.

38:47.977 --> 38:50.284
YOU--YOU FLATTER ME,
BUT, UH,

38:50.328 --> 38:52.373
I CAN'T
TAKE CREDIT FOR THAT.

38:52.417 --> 38:53.896
MOSS DIDN'T HAVE TO RUN.

38:53.940 --> 38:55.463
I WOULD HAVE
BROUGHT HIM IN.

38:55.507 --> 38:59.293

HIS OWN HEAD IN THE NOOSE.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.469

39:01.513 --> 39:04.559
TO KEEP EVERYONE'S
HANDS CLEAN.

39:04.603 --> 39:06.169
MOSS FIRED HIS GUN.

39:06.213 --> 39:07.432
SO YOU ALL SAY.

39:07.475 --> 39:11.653
AND OF COURSE, MOSS
CAN'T TELL HIS VERSION.

39:11.697 --> 39:17.180
AND NOW RIGSBY HAS TAKEN
PERFECTLY LEGAL REVENGE

39:17.224 --> 39:19.487

WHO KILLED HIS FATHER.

39:22.708 --> 39:25.363
DO YOU THINK
IT WILL AFFECT HIM?

39:28.496 --> 39:31.586
WELL, I THINK IT'S BETTER
TO REGRET SOMETHING YOU DID

39:31.630 --> 39:34.676

DIDN'T DO.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.374
