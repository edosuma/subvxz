WEBVTT

00:08.633 --> 00:09.842
Let me see what you got.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.898
Go. Go!

00:23.898 --> 00:25.733
Oh, my God.

00:25.733 --> 00:27.985
Oh, I heard you broke up
with your hot doctor lover.

00:27.985 --> 00:29.612
I heard you broke up
with yours.

00:29.612 --> 00:30.905
Yeah.

00:30.905 --> 00:31.739
Yeah, we're dumb.
So dumb.

00:31.739 --> 00:32.865
We're so dumb.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.827
Hey, where's
your baby?

00:35.827 --> 00:37.203
What?
I have a baby?

00:38.246 --> 00:40.164
She's ‐‐ She's having
a sleepover

00:40.164 --> 00:42.542
with my sister
in some fancy hotel.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.002
Which means that I can have
an adult sleepover.

00:45.002 --> 00:47.338
Oh. Hot.

00:47.338 --> 00:49.215
Hey, I think I love you.

00:51.384 --> 00:52.552
I can't hear you.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.262
Excuse me.

00:56.722 --> 00:59.976
So, are we talking about it
or drinking about it?

00:59.976 --> 01:01.227
The second thing.

01:05.355 --> 01:06.524
Oh, my God!

01:06.524 --> 01:08.776
My house!
My life!

01:08.776 --> 01:10.736
Don't worry.
My dad's coming.

01:10.736 --> 01:12.363
Right, Mami?
Sí, mi amor.

01:12.363 --> 01:13.948
They're coming.
They're coming.

01:17.326 --> 01:18.911
Move it, Souza.

01:20.538 --> 01:22.999
Look.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.834
Herrera,
charge that hose!

01:24.834 --> 01:26.085
Let's go, boys.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.628
Need that
delta wall opened up

01:27.628 --> 01:28.588
so I can check
for a connection.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.092
Phew.

01:33.092 --> 01:34.427
Have you at least
talked to him?

01:34.427 --> 01:36.262
Who, my husband?

01:36.262 --> 01:37.346
Or you mean the guy
who turned himself in

01:37.346 --> 01:38.598
to the Civil Service
Commission

01:38.598 --> 01:40.016
without consulting
his wife?

01:40.016 --> 01:41.851
Or, wait, do you mean the guy
who got suspended without pay

01:41.851 --> 01:43.186
for stealing narcotics

01:43.186 --> 01:44.896
in order to take down
our Fire Chief ‐‐

01:44.896 --> 01:46.189
which didn't work,
by the way ‐‐

01:46.189 --> 01:47.732
and all it did was
delay my father's funeral?

01:47.732 --> 01:49.025
You mean that guy?

01:49.025 --> 01:50.902
See, I'm confused
'cause...

01:50.902 --> 01:53.029
...I thought those were all
the same guy.

01:54.572 --> 01:55.656
Ugh.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.868
You know, I don't think
I've ever seen you

01:58.868 --> 02:00.995
not mad at your husband,

02:00.995 --> 02:03.080
which
is kind of funny

02:03.080 --> 02:04.290
'cause I don't think
I've ever seen you

02:04.290 --> 02:05.583
not mad at your dad,
either.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.380
Yeah.
No, not funny. Okay.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.722
 Ma'am, is there
anyone else in the house?

02:19.722 --> 02:21.891
No, no.
My husband's at work, thank God.

02:21.891 --> 02:24.685
Souza, help Herrera
knock that fire down!

02:24.685 --> 02:25.811
On it!

02:32.276 --> 02:34.320
Cap, looks like we've got
an electrical short.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.488
Well, you know
what to do.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.656
Copy.

02:36.656 --> 02:41.077
Andy. Your dad ‐‐
he's one of the greats.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.287
Thank you, ladies.

02:43.287 --> 02:44.956
Hi. It's Sandra.
Leave me a message.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.125
Hey.

02:48.125 --> 02:50.253
I don't want to talk
about my dad or my husband,

02:50.253 --> 02:52.046
so if it's either
of those things ‐‐
It's not.

02:54.882 --> 02:56.217
Okay,
it was gonna be,

02:56.217 --> 02:58.719
so now I'm just gonna stand here
in awkward silence.

02:58.719 --> 03:00.513
Come on. Come dance.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.974
We haven't all hung out
on our night off in forever.

03:02.974 --> 03:06.018
Okay, fine, but...

03:06.018 --> 03:07.270
I need another shot
first.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.647
Yes! Look who I convinced
to dance!

03:17.154 --> 03:19.991
Well, your old man did
pretty good today, m'ija, right?

03:19.991 --> 03:21.242
Mwah!

03:21.242 --> 03:22.577
 Let me take a picture
of the two of you.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.287
Of course. Okay.
Let's see.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.830
Look serious, like
a firefighter. Come on.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.164
One, two, and...
Beep!

03:27.164 --> 03:28.249
...three.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.419
Okay, back to work.
Mwah!

03:31.419 --> 03:32.545
Love you.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.588
Oh!
 Yes! Yes!

03:34.588 --> 03:35.756
That's awesome.
Whoo!

03:36.882 --> 03:38.426
Whoo!

04:04.076 --> 04:05.828
 Ugh.
Mnh.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.121
Wake up.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.456
We're getting
called in.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.582
Wait.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.833
Where's my phone?

04:13.669 --> 04:18.548
Ohh, fffffffor God's sake.

04:21.927 --> 04:23.095
What happened?

04:23.095 --> 04:24.597
Ahh! Why are you
in my bed?

04:24.597 --> 04:26.515
'Cause Travis and Emmett
slept in mine.

04:26.515 --> 04:29.393
Why are you yelling?
You can't just
sleep in my bed.

04:29.393 --> 04:31.479
Wait. Where's ‐‐
Where's my girlfriend?

04:31.479 --> 04:33.314
You have
a girlfriend?
Sasha!

04:33.314 --> 04:34.565
I wouldn't call her
your girlfriend.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.400
What?
Where is my girlfriend?!

04:36.400 --> 04:38.694
I don't know.
Why are you yelling?!

04:38.694 --> 04:40.988
My head hurts!
Aah! My head hurts, too!

04:40.988 --> 04:43.366
Guys, it is
a five‐alarm fire.
We got to go.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.576
No. No.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.119
No.
Ow. Ow!

04:47.119 --> 04:49.080
No! Stop.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.623
Did she sleep
in here?

04:51.916 --> 04:52.958
Emmett was
so smart to quit.

04:52.958 --> 04:54.377
Has anyone seen
my phone?

04:55.795 --> 04:57.004
That's it.
That's it.

04:57.004 --> 04:57.755
Is one of you
calling me?

04:57.755 --> 04:58.798
 Mnh‐mnh.

05:04.553 --> 05:06.597
No.

05:06.597 --> 05:09.266
No. Tía Sandra finally called me
back, and I missed it.

05:09.266 --> 05:10.893
Damn it!

05:10.893 --> 05:12.561
Uh, who's
Tía Sandra?

05:12.561 --> 05:13.729
Hey, you know what?

05:13.729 --> 05:15.856
It doesn't matter,
'cause we got to go!

05:15.856 --> 05:18.943
I'm supposed to have lunch
with Marsha, Inara, and Marcus.

05:18.943 --> 05:19.902
Change it
to dinner, Jack.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.779
Crap.
Robert's surgery.

05:21.779 --> 05:24.031
I'm supposed to be
at Grey‐Sloan, like, now.

05:24.031 --> 05:26.409
You know what?
You get a pass, okay?
You sit this one out.

05:26.409 --> 05:27.868
I love a good five‐alarm.

05:27.868 --> 05:29.286
Hey, don't worry.
There will be others.

05:29.286 --> 05:31.956
Go be with your...
battalion chief.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.583
Oh, my God, I still can't say
"husband," either.

05:34.583 --> 05:36.460
Hey, dude,
where's your girlfriend?

05:43.467 --> 05:44.719
Hey.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.011
Dad, what are
you doing here?

05:46.011 --> 05:47.304
Well, I figured
I'd stop by

05:47.304 --> 05:49.598
and see my daughter
the captain in action.

05:49.598 --> 05:51.100
I've been calling you
for days.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.852
I'm ‐‐ I'm ‐‐ I'm sorry.
There's been a lot going on.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.937
And I have to go, but just
hang here until I get back.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.565
Sure, kiddo.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.567
Hey.

05:59.567 --> 06:02.611
Go, Captain.

06:12.788 --> 06:14.665
What?

06:14.665 --> 06:16.292
I can just tell
from the way you smell

06:16.292 --> 06:18.127
that I am very glad
I had to stay home

06:18.127 --> 06:19.712
with two sick kids
last night.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.589
Yeah, you're so lucky.

06:24.091 --> 06:26.302
Tell me when we get there.
Will do.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.264
we've had an explosion
at Pac North.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.433
Contact Puget Sound Energy
to request a supervisor

06:32.433 --> 06:33.851
and gas‐leak response team.

06:33.851 --> 06:36.437
Additionally, we need Seattle PD
to shut down all traffic

06:36.437 --> 06:38.189
north and west of the hospital.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.607
 Thought the hospital
was closed.

06:40.649 --> 06:42.234
ER's open
and transferring admits.

06:42.234 --> 06:43.986
Radiology on the first floor,
research wing in the basement.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.154
Gas leak?
That's our guess.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.405
Utilities are off.

06:56.248 --> 06:57.750
Dispatch,
this is Pac North IC.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.084
We just had an explosion
on the third floor.

07:07.968 --> 07:10.095
 Seattle Fire!
Everyone needs to evacuate now!

07:10.095 --> 07:11.764
 Help!
Help, please!

07:11.764 --> 07:13.349
C‐Can someone help?!

07:13.349 --> 07:14.183
Hello?

07:14.183 --> 07:16.185
Hi! Yes!
I'm inside here!

07:16.185 --> 07:18.604
I have a bad back,
and I ‐‐ and I can't get out.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.231
There was an explosion
or something,

07:20.231 --> 07:23.359
and the kid just left,
ran out screaming.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.027
So I see they haven't improved
their staff much here.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.529
Alright,
we'll get you out.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.448
What‐‐ What's happening?

07:29.448 --> 07:31.575
It's jammed! I ‐‐
Machine must be faulty.

07:31.575 --> 07:33.077
Great hospital.

07:33.077 --> 07:34.828
And we can't use tools
because ‐‐

07:34.828 --> 07:36.121
Because this thing's
a giant magnet,

07:36.121 --> 07:37.456
and if it turns back on,
we're screwed.

07:37.456 --> 07:40.084
Oh, cool. That's just great
for my anxiety.

07:40.084 --> 07:41.085
Hey, buddy,
what's your name?

07:41.085 --> 07:42.461
Uh, Duncan.
Duncan.

07:42.461 --> 07:44.088
Okay, Duncan,
we're gonna get you out.

07:44.088 --> 07:47.424
How?
I weigh like 250.

07:47.424 --> 07:49.051
Well, that's okay,

07:49.051 --> 07:50.886
because our job
is to work out.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.223
It's not.
Okay.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.935
Seattle Fire!

08:00.437 --> 08:03.691
Everyone out!
Let's go! Let's go!

08:05.901 --> 08:08.279
Everyone, we need
to evacuate now!

08:08.279 --> 08:10.281
Monica, don't forget
the lab notes.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.949
And grab those samples
over there.

08:11.949 --> 08:12.741
 Ma'am,
did you hear me?

08:12.741 --> 08:14.410
Th‐There's a fire.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.412
I am not letting my life's work
burn to the ground.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.413
Lives depend on it.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.539
And it's not "ma'am."
It's "Doctor."

08:18.539 --> 08:20.165
 Really?

08:20.165 --> 08:22.543
Because your lives depend on us
evacuating you right now.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.044
This floor
is an active fire scene.

08:24.044 --> 08:25.462
Oh, damn it!

08:25.462 --> 08:26.964
Help me!

08:26.964 --> 08:28.966
Dr. Alba is really close
to a cure for lymphoma.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.759
You're firefighters.

08:30.759 --> 08:33.429
Your risk of developing
occupationally derived cancer

08:33.429 --> 08:34.679
is what?

08:36.097 --> 08:38.225
Grab all of those
frozen specimens in there.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.186
 Hey, uh, Duncan...

08:41.186 --> 08:43.022
...why were you
in the hospital today?

08:43.022 --> 08:44.523
Is it your back?
You rupture a disc?

08:46.984 --> 08:48.611
Hey, Duncan,
the more you talk,

08:48.611 --> 08:49.862
the less anxious you'll be.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.281
I cheated on my wife

08:52.281 --> 08:54.074
before we got married.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.329
Okay.
It was a mistake.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.581
It was just one night,

09:00.581 --> 09:03.959
and I've always,
always regretted it.

09:03.959 --> 09:06.128
But I can't never tell Carla.

09:06.128 --> 09:08.631
But I got to tell somebody,

09:08.631 --> 09:12.301
especially if I'm about to die.

09:14.678 --> 09:16.055
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:16.055 --> 09:18.098
Hey.
Hey, you know what?

09:18.098 --> 09:19.725
I slept with
an engaged friend.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.310
Yeah. I did.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.270
Even after
he wasn't engaged anymore,

09:23.270 --> 09:26.190
I kept sleeping with him
because I liked it.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.566
I slept with him
even after I knew

09:27.566 --> 09:29.109
he was falling in love
with me.

09:29.109 --> 09:30.986
I actually slept with him
last night.

09:30.986 --> 09:33.614
And a little bit
this morning.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.115
Do you love him?

09:37.660 --> 09:39.244
No.

09:39.244 --> 09:40.913
Th‐‐ That's cold.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.581
Yeah, I know.

09:47.628 --> 09:48.671
And, uh, you know ‐‐
And I ‐‐

09:48.671 --> 09:50.506
I‐I'm, uh ‐‐

09:50.506 --> 09:52.883
I am
extremely judgmental.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.259
What?
Yeah.

09:54.259 --> 09:55.636
You know, I'm a ‐‐
I'm a friendly guy.

09:55.636 --> 09:56.637
I like people.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.889
But, uh, I secretly
judge them

09:58.889 --> 10:00.307
for not living up
to my standards.

10:00.307 --> 10:02.267
You serious?
I am.

10:02.267 --> 10:04.895
I, uh, am silently judging you
right now.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.605
Both of you.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.148
 Hughes here.

10:08.148 --> 10:09.692
Requesting backup
in the research wing.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.986
Copy that.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.237
Warren and I
are on our way

10:13.237 --> 10:15.739
as soon as we evac
our patient.

10:29.461 --> 10:33.424
 Andy, your dad ‐‐
he's one of the greats.

10:46.186 --> 10:47.730
Robert, I'm so sorry
I'm late.

10:47.730 --> 10:48.856
You didn't come home
last night.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.107
I‐I told you.
What ‐‐

10:50.107 --> 10:51.525
I was ‐‐ I was hanging out
with the guys.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.068
You didn't tell me you were
sleeping over with the guys.

10:53.068 --> 10:54.069
You're right.
I'm sorry.

10:54.069 --> 10:55.529
I ‐‐ I'm ‐‐

10:55.529 --> 10:59.033
I'm still getting used to
this whole marriage thing.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.909
Sandra finally
called me back,

11:00.909 --> 11:03.412
but she didn't leave a message,
and now she's not answering,

11:03.412 --> 11:04.788
which is ‐‐ I mean,
she must know something, right?

11:04.788 --> 11:06.915
Maybe she heard about your
dad's passing and then tried to

11:06.915 --> 11:08.751
extend her condolences.
That's why she called.
She hated my father.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.045
She ‐‐ They didn't
speak for decades.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.421
He kept her from me.
He kept my cousins from me.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.922
You know,
sometimes it's easier

11:13.922 --> 11:15.799
to be mad at someone you lost
than to grieve them, Andy.

11:15.799 --> 11:17.634
I am grieving him.
You're trying to
find a reason...

11:17.634 --> 11:19.094
I‐I miss him...
...to be mad at
your father and ‐‐

11:19.094 --> 11:20.429
...every minute
of every day,

11:20.429 --> 11:22.848
and I'm furious with him
for lying to me

11:22.848 --> 11:23.932
and keeping my family
from me.

11:23.932 --> 11:25.059
Why can't both of
those things be true?

11:25.059 --> 11:27.394
Because he just died!

11:27.394 --> 11:29.396
Heroically.

11:29.396 --> 11:31.523
Saving your entire team.

11:31.523 --> 11:33.525
Okay.

11:33.525 --> 11:35.861
I'm
interrupting something, clearly.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.405
Dr. Shepherd, right?
Andy. Yeah.

11:38.405 --> 11:39.490
Good to see you again.
Good to see you.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.536
Hello?

11:45.704 --> 11:47.164
 Alright, everybody,
let's double‐time it.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.582
Come on.
Keep it moving, guys.

11:48.582 --> 11:49.750
Keep it moving.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.710
Double time.
Come on.

11:51.710 --> 11:54.379
Hey, Cutler, take them outside
and make sure they stay there.

11:54.379 --> 11:55.589
I don't want anyone else
coming back inside the building.

11:55.589 --> 11:56.924
Let's go.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.717
This incubator
and all these files ‐‐

11:58.717 --> 12:00.219
we need all of this out.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.261
 So, we're
a moving service now?

12:01.261 --> 12:02.971
Does she know
there's a fire upstairs?

12:02.971 --> 12:04.348
This is her
lymphoma research.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.557
She's refusing
to leave without it,

12:05.557 --> 12:06.850
and we can't leave
without her, so...

12:06.850 --> 12:08.352
Isn't all this stuff
digitized?

12:08.352 --> 12:10.604
You can't digitize
a living organism.

12:10.604 --> 12:11.939
I mean, she's right.
You can't.

12:11.939 --> 12:14.566
 Gibson, I need all of 19
out of that building now.

12:14.566 --> 12:15.734
Copy, Captain.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.277
Doctor, it's time
to go, okay?

12:17.277 --> 12:19.696
No! Get your hands
off of me!

12:20.989 --> 12:22.533
Look out!

12:23.909 --> 12:24.785
Ohh!

12:31.708 --> 12:32.584
Miller?

12:32.584 --> 12:34.336
Miller!

12:34.336 --> 12:36.672
Miller, you good?

12:36.672 --> 12:37.840
Everybody okay?

12:42.886 --> 12:44.847
Oh, no.
My God.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.932
 We have two firefighters
from 23 with blast injuries.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.101
19. 19, do you copy?

12:49.101 --> 12:50.477
Copy.

12:50.477 --> 12:52.980
Explosion above us caused
collapse of the hallway outside.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.398
Gibson here
with Hughes, Miller,

12:54.398 --> 12:56.108
Warren, Montgomery,
and one patient.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.901
But where's Dr. Alba?

12:57.901 --> 12:58.944
Dr. Alba?

12:58.944 --> 13:00.571
‐Doctor?!
‐Dr. Alba!

13:01.864 --> 13:03.448
 Come on.
Come on.

13:03.448 --> 13:05.159
Doctor, we're gonna
get you out, okay?

13:05.159 --> 13:06.451
My phone!

13:06.451 --> 13:09.037
I need my phone!
I need to call my partner!

13:09.037 --> 13:10.706
 Gibson,
do you have egress?

13:10.706 --> 13:11.874
Negative.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.626
Bishop. Sato. Report.

13:14.626 --> 13:16.628
Third explosion and fire
on the third floor

13:16.628 --> 13:18.797
weakened structural integrity,
causing partial collapse.

13:18.797 --> 13:20.549
We have two from 23 injured

13:20.549 --> 13:22.634
and five currently trapped
in the basement research wing.

13:22.634 --> 13:24.511
Chief! Chief Dixon!
Over here, sir!
Requesting USAR company
to come in

13:24.511 --> 13:26.138
a‐and...
Afternoon, all.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.389
Happy to answer any questions

13:27.389 --> 13:28.432
you may have at this time.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.518
What's USAR's ETA?

13:31.518 --> 13:33.520
He said
five minutes out.

13:36.481 --> 13:39.067
Anytime I say anything,
you think it's a criticism.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.111
You sound like it!
You're criticizing me!

13:41.111 --> 13:42.446
Because I'm unhappy!

13:42.446 --> 13:44.907
Oh, you're unhappy.
God, what ‐‐

14:07.262 --> 14:09.389
So, the surgery
is happening?

14:09.389 --> 14:10.933
Oh, it's happening.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.435
And the odds of it working
are still just 50‐50?

14:13.435 --> 14:15.520
Yep.
But I'm feeling lucky.

14:16.563 --> 14:19.274
No narcotics
after surgery, okay?

14:19.274 --> 14:20.525
I'm not gonna let this
take me out.

14:20.525 --> 14:21.902
I admire your commitment,

14:21.902 --> 14:23.612
and you don't have to
decide right now.

14:23.612 --> 14:24.905
The first couple days
are gonna be painful.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.032
I can take it.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.993
We are gonna want you
up on your feet right away,

14:29.993 --> 14:32.371
walking and standing.
Okay.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.122
That is gonna be uncomfortable,
to say the least.

14:34.122 --> 14:36.166
I can order you
a nerve block ‐‐
No narcotics.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.501
Oh, my God.
Tía Sandra called.

14:37.501 --> 14:39.378
She's on her way
to Seattle.
Okay.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.797
She said she couldn't
talk over the phone, but...

14:41.797 --> 14:42.714
What does ‐‐
What does that mean?

14:42.714 --> 14:44.383
Babe ‐‐

14:44.383 --> 14:46.468
Uh, w‐we're gonna be taking
Robert up to the pre‐op area

14:46.468 --> 14:48.303
pretty soon.

14:48.303 --> 14:49.680
Okay. Right, right.
I'm sorry.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.390
It's okay. I'm fine.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.017
Uh, would you show Ms. Herrera
to the plant room?

14:54.017 --> 14:55.894
What's ‐‐
What's that?

14:55.894 --> 14:58.313
Studies have shown
that nature, greenery,

14:58.313 --> 15:00.148
uh, helps calm
the central nervous system.

15:00.148 --> 15:01.483
Works for me.

15:01.483 --> 15:02.567
I ‐‐ Good luck.

15:02.567 --> 15:04.111
I will be
right here.
Okay.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.237
And I'll see you
right after.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.447
Yeah. Okay.
Okay. I love you.

15:07.447 --> 15:09.157
I love you.

15:10.659 --> 15:11.827
Oh, there. Okay.

15:11.827 --> 15:15.205
Robert, is she ‐‐

15:15.205 --> 15:17.791
Is she what?
High? Drunk?

15:17.791 --> 15:19.626
No. She's grieving
her father.

15:21.461 --> 15:23.588
She's spinning out.
That was my next guess.

15:23.588 --> 15:27.175
Um...you are gonna need
her support after the surgery.

15:27.175 --> 15:29.469
I'm gonna have it, okay?

15:29.469 --> 15:30.929
She'll be there for me.

15:30.929 --> 15:33.682
She's just going
through a lot, is all.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.353
Okay.

15:38.353 --> 15:39.563
Alright.

15:39.563 --> 15:40.856
What ‐‐ What are
you doing?

15:40.856 --> 15:42.858
We're having a meeting,
you and me, right now.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.609
A meeting?
I'm about to have surgery.

15:44.609 --> 15:45.652
And you just got married,

15:45.652 --> 15:48.321
and your wife
just lost her father,

15:48.321 --> 15:51.074
and you could lose your job
and go to jail.

15:51.074 --> 15:52.159
Your life
is in session,

15:52.159 --> 15:53.452
and you are keeping it
all inside,

15:53.452 --> 15:54.703
and that is a recipe
for relapse.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.371
I'm not gonna relapse.

15:56.371 --> 15:58.540
I just need to get through
this surgery right now

15:58.540 --> 16:00.375
without using and ‐‐

16:00.375 --> 16:03.378
And how do addicts get
through life without using?

16:03.378 --> 16:06.089
We talk to each other.

16:06.089 --> 16:07.883
Come on.

16:10.552 --> 16:13.221
God, grant me
the serenity

16:13.221 --> 16:15.682
to accept the things
I cannot change...

16:15.682 --> 16:18.393
We lost Wi‐Fi
mid‐transfer,

16:18.393 --> 16:21.813
so I am going to have to
read you what I can myself,

16:21.813 --> 16:24.316
and I need you to
take it down exactly.

16:24.316 --> 16:27.486
If I die in here,
I need my research not to.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.862
Alright, one more,
on three.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.280
One, two...

16:30.280 --> 16:31.490
Yep.
...three!

16:31.490 --> 16:33.075
Aaah!

16:33.075 --> 16:34.618
 Okay, clear the area.
Clear the area.

16:39.247 --> 16:41.291
I'm gonna get
the first‐aid kit.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.460
Okay, now read those
data points back to me.

16:49.007 --> 16:51.093
I think the universe is trying
to tell me something.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.135
Yeah? What?

16:52.135 --> 16:53.970
I keep getting trapped
in places.

16:53.970 --> 16:56.598
It's like immersion therapy,
but it's not working.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.976
What do we think caused
the multiple explosions?

16:59.976 --> 17:01.436
We turned
the gas off.

17:01.436 --> 17:04.897
No. You inverted the last value
I gave you.

17:04.897 --> 17:06.775
Make sure they correspond.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.068
I'm gonna cut.
Right there.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.328
Captain,
we are still trapped,

17:18.328 --> 17:20.038
and we've got a patient
with crush injuries,

17:20.038 --> 17:21.164
including
a pelvic fracture

17:21.164 --> 17:22.457
and open
radial fracture

17:22.457 --> 17:24.166
and substantial
blood loss.

17:24.166 --> 17:25.544
Solid.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.721
Everybody, radios off.
Turn your radios off.

17:36.721 --> 17:37.806
What? Why?
What?

17:37.806 --> 17:39.266
J‐Just turn them off now!

17:39.266 --> 17:40.434
so that we can assess the ‐‐

17:40.434 --> 17:41.601
Dr. Alba,
turn off your phone!

17:41.601 --> 17:43.520
Miller,
what's the problem?

17:43.520 --> 17:47.315
The explosions ‐‐
they're a bravo tango.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.030
A bomb?!

17:54.030 --> 17:54.948
Why would you ‐‐

17:54.948 --> 17:56.408
'Cause I just found
another one.

18:03.039 --> 18:05.208
Bishop,
we have a suspicious device.

18:05.208 --> 18:06.418
No, no, wait. No, no, no.
No radios. No radios.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.794
If it's a bomb,
we got to call it in,

18:07.794 --> 18:08.920
get the bomb squad in here.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.130
How are they
gonna get in here?

18:10.130 --> 18:11.256
How do we even know
it's a bomb?

18:11.256 --> 18:12.299
I trained with
the bomb squad.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.383
You did?

18:13.383 --> 18:15.302
Yeah. We ‐‐ We ‐‐
We doing this now?

18:15.302 --> 18:16.803
Yeah. Sorry. No.
Wha‐‐ Okay, what do we do?

18:17.888 --> 18:19.473
Get the hell out of here.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.061
Miller, get away
from that.

18:25.061 --> 18:26.229
It looks homemade.

18:26.229 --> 18:27.564
Who the hell
bombs a hospital, anyway?

18:27.564 --> 18:29.065
Anti‐choice.

18:29.065 --> 18:30.901
It's not the first time
they've attacked me.

18:30.901 --> 18:34.029
I use embryonic stem cells
in my research.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.948
How can people claim
to be pro‐life

18:36.948 --> 18:40.076
but be willing to sacrifice
millions of lives

18:40.076 --> 18:41.536
that could be saved
by research?

18:43.121 --> 18:47.042
Gibson? Gibson!

18:47.042 --> 18:48.752
This is Pac North IC
requesting SPD Bomb Squad,

18:48.752 --> 18:50.128
Code Red response.

18:50.128 --> 18:51.838
And we still have a news chopper
and a drone.

18:51.838 --> 18:52.839
Medevac's still not clear
to land.

18:52.839 --> 18:54.549
There's my girl.

18:54.549 --> 18:57.177
Being boss.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.470
Dad, what are you
doing here?

18:58.470 --> 19:00.096
Well, I saw you
on the news.

19:00.096 --> 19:02.098
I wanted to watch you
actually do something.

19:02.098 --> 19:03.808
Dad, you can't ‐‐
Don't "Dad" me.

19:03.808 --> 19:05.936
Go do something,
Captain.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.437
Go.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.069
you got to stay awake
for us, okay?

19:14.069 --> 19:15.153
Her pulse is thready.

19:15.153 --> 19:16.613
She's bleeding
internally.

19:18.865 --> 19:20.534
Miller, you are really
testing me right now.

19:20.534 --> 19:21.660
Relax.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.453
I just need to see
if there's a clock.

19:23.453 --> 19:24.955
 Hey, Miller,
please don't do that.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.331
I'm just gonna
pull this out.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.124
No, Miller, stop! Stop! Stop!
What are you ‐‐
Hey. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hey!

19:28.124 --> 19:30.210
Hey! How many of you trained
with the bomb squad?

19:30.210 --> 19:31.670
Zero.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.879
If I don't defuse this,

19:32.879 --> 19:34.714
it will go off,
just like the other three.

19:34.714 --> 19:35.840
USAR will get us out.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.050
The bomb squad
will come in.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.135
This ain't your job, Miller.
Stand down.

19:39.135 --> 19:41.137
What time did we get
that first call?

19:41.137 --> 19:43.098
A few minutes
after 11:00.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.391
And the second blast
happened when?

19:44.391 --> 19:45.976
11, uh, 30.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.352
11:30,
when we got here.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.104
Third explosion
happened around noon.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.565
Yeah.
That sounds like a pattern.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.109
And if it is a pattern,
that bomb will go off

19:54.109 --> 19:56.152
in elev‐‐
11 minutes.

19:56.152 --> 19:58.905
Stop. Stop it.

19:58.905 --> 20:01.074
Go help ‐‐
Go help him.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.909
Get my life's work
out of here.

20:02.909 --> 20:04.077
No, we're not gonna leave you,
Dr. Alba.

20:04.077 --> 20:06.705
I am already dead.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.957
Save my life's work.

20:08.957 --> 20:12.252
Save ‐‐
Save countless millions.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.295
Please!

20:13.295 --> 20:14.796
Go.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.758
 Okay.

20:20.510 --> 20:21.678
Ready?

20:21.678 --> 20:23.054
Ready.

20:23.054 --> 20:25.557
Count back
from 10 for me.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.977
10, 9, 8...

20:39.487 --> 20:40.864
Oh!

20:49.831 --> 20:51.666
Mami, it's not
even lunchtime yet.

20:51.666 --> 20:53.918
Well, guess what.
You deserve a break, baby.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.094
I want you to try
every single one of them, okay?

21:03.094 --> 21:06.473
I want you to experiment,
explore.

21:07.682 --> 21:10.644
Oh, yum!

21:10.644 --> 21:13.897
Promise me that you'll
never settle in life.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.109
There you go.

21:18.109 --> 21:20.070
Look at the sky, honey.

21:20.070 --> 21:21.446
Look at the sky.

21:21.446 --> 21:24.741
Never, ever take your eyes
off it.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.785
There we go. Whoo!

21:32.457 --> 21:34.668
Ohh!
Oh, my goodness!
Herrera!

21:34.668 --> 21:36.044
Oh. Are you okay?

21:36.044 --> 21:38.088
I'm ‐‐ I'm ‐‐
My husband's in surgery.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.381
I can get
an update for you.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.966
My dad died.
He ‐‐ He just died.

21:41.966 --> 21:44.219
I had heard that.
I'm ‐‐ I'm so sorry.

21:44.219 --> 21:45.637
I know the two of you
were close.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.971
I thought we were.

21:46.971 --> 21:49.474
Nothing makes sense
anymore.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.558
And, you know, every‐‐

21:50.558 --> 21:52.060
everyone thinks
it's the grief talking,

21:52.060 --> 21:54.145
and maybe it is, but I‐I can't
shake the feeling

21:54.145 --> 21:56.898
that maybe something
really awful happened.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.316
With your dad?

21:58.316 --> 22:00.110
With my mom.
Oh, God, I am sorry.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.111
You don't even know me.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.154
No, no. Listen.
It's okay.

22:03.154 --> 22:04.781
I‐I have plenty of stuff
in my own life.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.492
I could use a break.
You can talk.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.704
I thought my parents
were happy.

22:10.704 --> 22:15.417
But I‐I keep getting these
flashes of them fighting,

22:15.417 --> 22:17.669
screaming,
my mom crying.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.881
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22:21.881 --> 22:23.508
I just ‐‐
It's okay.

22:23.508 --> 22:28.179
You know, the one favorite
memory I have of my mother,

22:28.179 --> 22:30.473
the one I‐I've kept with me
all these years,

22:30.473 --> 22:34.728
was our last fun day
together.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.438
And I‐I've always
held on to that

22:36.438 --> 22:38.440
as an example
of how much she loved me,

22:38.440 --> 22:40.859
how much I lost.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.902
But now ‐‐ now I think maybe

22:42.902 --> 22:47.282
she knew it was
our last day together.

22:47.282 --> 22:51.161
And now I think
maybe she killed herself.

22:53.413 --> 22:54.831
Oh, no.

22:56.249 --> 22:57.542
I'm sorry.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.961
It's okay.
It's okay.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.635
This is
the best day ever.

23:10.138 --> 23:12.474
I want you to remember
something, baby.

23:15.059 --> 23:17.562
If anything
ever happens to me,

23:17.562 --> 23:21.691
Daddy will always
take care of you, okay?

23:21.691 --> 23:24.652
What's gonna
happen to you?

23:24.652 --> 23:26.738
Nothing, honey.

23:26.738 --> 23:30.074
Just remember ‐‐
he'll take care of you,

23:30.074 --> 23:31.201
and you'll take
care of him, okay?

23:32.577 --> 23:34.370
I love you.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.251
and it's always been
just me and my dad.

23:40.251 --> 23:42.295
But I started to remember ‐‐

23:42.295 --> 23:44.881
we had this
big extended family.

23:44.881 --> 23:47.175
And ‐‐ And when
my mom died,

23:47.175 --> 23:50.345
everyone just disappeared,
like we were lepers.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.347
And I didn't ‐‐
I didn't even remember them.

23:52.347 --> 23:53.890
I didn't think about them.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.810
I ‐‐ It's like
I blocked them out or something.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.603
Until my dad died.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.730
And, you know, I started
going through his stuff,

24:00.730 --> 24:03.149
and then I talked to my dad's
friend, and he was cagey and ‐‐

24:03.149 --> 24:05.276
I don't.
I'm...

24:05.276 --> 24:06.820
I'm probably
being paranoid.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.238
Or you're just
remembering stuff

24:08.238 --> 24:10.657
that you tried very hard
to forget.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.867
The brain
is an amazing machine.

24:12.867 --> 24:15.995
If there's an event or a loss
that's too traumatic,

24:15.995 --> 24:17.914
it has a way of
walling itself off

24:17.914 --> 24:19.624
so you can
survive the trauma.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.085
And then
here come the memories.

24:22.085 --> 24:25.129
They come back in fragments
and little puzzle pieces

24:25.129 --> 24:27.173
that then you have
to put together.

24:27.173 --> 24:30.426
And when that happens,
that hurts.

24:30.426 --> 24:33.304
And I'm not talking about
just emotionally.

24:33.304 --> 24:35.807
The body remembers
the event.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.184
The brain remembers
the trauma.

24:38.184 --> 24:41.688
And that ‐‐
that's a whole body ache.

24:44.607 --> 24:46.276
Thank you.

24:46.276 --> 24:49.946
Thank you for...

24:49.946 --> 24:51.614
The people who love me

24:51.614 --> 24:53.867
keep telling me
I sound crazy.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.910
Oh, Herrera,
you know what?

24:55.910 --> 24:58.454
For what it's worth,
you don't sound crazy.

24:58.454 --> 25:00.665
And sometimes
a breakthrough

25:00.665 --> 25:03.501
can look an awful lot
like a breakdown.

25:11.217 --> 25:12.802
 We have five firefighters
and a civilian

25:12.802 --> 25:14.012
trapped in the basement

25:14.012 --> 25:15.471
with what we think
is a suspicious device,

25:15.471 --> 25:16.723
and now we have
no communication.

25:16.723 --> 25:17.849
They switched off radios

25:17.849 --> 25:19.058
to avoid
any electrical interference

25:19.058 --> 25:20.351
with the detonator.

25:20.351 --> 25:21.728
Smart.
Our crew is
on the move.

25:21.728 --> 25:24.898
Hey, kiddo.
Kiddo!

25:24.898 --> 25:26.024
Come here.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.027
Hey, Dad, you should
probably wait for me at home.

25:29.027 --> 25:32.280
Your family's falling apart,
and you're playing Fire Captain?

25:32.280 --> 25:34.282
I'm not playing anything.
I am Captain.

25:34.282 --> 25:35.992
Did your mother fill your head
with drama? Hmm?

25:35.992 --> 25:38.369
IS that why you're
treating me this way?

25:38.369 --> 25:39.829
You know, Dad, I have to go,
and you have to ‐‐

25:39.829 --> 25:43.291
Don't raise your voice at me,
young lady.

25:43.291 --> 25:44.959
Eight minutes.

25:44.959 --> 25:45.960
Okay, Miller,
what do we do?

25:49.422 --> 25:51.007
Autoclave.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.301
Over there.
It looks like a microwave.

25:53.301 --> 25:54.260
 Right.
Right, right, right, right.

25:54.260 --> 25:56.220
It's for sterilization,
but it's airtight.

25:56.220 --> 25:58.598
It can dampen
the explosion.

25:58.598 --> 25:59.891
We got to get it
closer to the bomb.

26:01.392 --> 26:03.353
It's ‐‐ It's ‐‐
It's bolted down.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.607
Dad, interfering with
emergency personnel is a crime.

26:07.607 --> 26:08.524
I am not gonna
ask you again.

26:08.524 --> 26:09.943
Are you
threatening me?

26:09.943 --> 26:13.488
I am in charge, and I am
ordering you to leave my scene.

26:13.488 --> 26:15.073
What did you say?
You heard me.

26:16.157 --> 26:18.201
Get your hands
off of me!

26:24.248 --> 26:25.375
This thing's
not going anywhere.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.043
And we are
running out of time.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.753
Four minutes.
Four minutes!

26:32.006 --> 26:33.800
 Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!
 Miller! Miller!

26:33.800 --> 26:35.593
No, no,
guys, guys, guys!

26:35.593 --> 26:37.178
Either I put that in there
or we all die.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.639
And my research.
Please.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.099
Countless millions,
right?

26:41.099 --> 26:41.891
Yeah.

26:45.478 --> 26:47.355
Let me do it.
No. No.

26:47.355 --> 26:48.690
Hey, hey.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.233
I'm not gonna let you
orphan your daughter.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.985
I'm not letting you ‐‐ No!
Let me do ‐‐ Let me do it!

26:54.445 --> 26:55.780
Oh, yeah.

26:55.780 --> 26:58.116
Oh, you need your big, strong
men to fight your battles,

26:58.116 --> 27:00.326
huh, Captain?
No, Dad, I don't!

27:00.326 --> 27:02.161
I don't need to
win my gold medals
through other people.

27:02.161 --> 27:04.664
Unlike you,
I win them myself.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.877
I'm fine.
Everyone back to work.

27:09.877 --> 27:11.546
Go on. Get to
the other side. Let's go.

27:11.546 --> 27:12.547
I'm gonna open the door.
Come on.

27:12.547 --> 27:13.673
To the other side!
Let's go!

27:13.673 --> 27:15.633
Go, go, go!
That's an order. Let's go!

27:17.385 --> 27:18.886
Dr. Alba?
 Other side now.

27:18.886 --> 27:20.680
That's an order.
To the other side.
Dr. Alba?

27:20.680 --> 27:22.014
Dr. Alba, we're gonna
move you now, okay?

27:22.014 --> 27:23.474
She's gone.

27:23.474 --> 27:25.393
She's gone.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.065
We got two minutes.
Two minutes.
 Okay.

27:32.191 --> 27:34.360
One, two, three.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.903
Okay.

27:35.903 --> 27:37.530
 Here. Go help them.
Go help.

27:37.530 --> 27:38.740
 Take the mice.
Save the research.

27:38.740 --> 27:39.907
Come on.
Get in, get in, get in.

27:39.907 --> 27:40.908
Help him. Help him.

27:40.908 --> 27:41.784
I got it.
I got it.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.086
Here we go.

28:16.736 --> 28:18.613
 And I will let
Police Commissioner Clark

28:18.613 --> 28:21.616
update you on the details
of the bombing investigation.

28:21.616 --> 28:23.659
Thank you all
very much.

28:23.659 --> 28:25.953
Sir, a word, please?

28:39.926 --> 28:41.177
How much time
do we have?

28:41.177 --> 28:42.345
About a minute.
You're fine, Gibson.

28:42.345 --> 28:45.014
Just ‐‐ Just take
your time, okay?

28:45.014 --> 28:47.600
Okay.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.894
Okay, okay.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.145
Just keep it level.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.275
If that switch moves
and the mercury ‐‐

28:56.275 --> 28:58.361
Got it ‐‐ I die.

28:58.361 --> 29:00.112
Thanks, Miller.

29:31.769 --> 29:33.646
 Come on,
come on, come on!
 Okay, Gibson,
get your ass over here!

29:33.646 --> 29:34.856
Come on!
 Move, move, move,
move, move!

29:34.856 --> 29:35.940
Move, move, move!
Get in! Get in! Get in!

29:35.940 --> 29:38.276
Hey, Smitty. At ease.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.027
Michael Dixon, we have
a warrant for your arrest.

29:40.027 --> 29:42.738
What is this,
some kind of prank?

29:42.738 --> 29:45.074
You're being charged
with fraud and extortion.

29:46.367 --> 29:47.618
You have the right
to remain silent.

29:47.618 --> 29:48.828
Anything you say can
and will be held a‐‐

29:48.828 --> 29:50.288
I know the Miranda rights.

30:23.863 --> 30:26.073
 You okay?

30:51.557 --> 30:53.059
I want bomb squad

30:53.059 --> 30:54.727
to comb through
every inch of that hospital.

30:54.727 --> 30:56.979
If there were four, who knows
how many more there are.

31:09.533 --> 31:11.452
Is that...

31:13.120 --> 31:14.997
It sure as hell is.

31:14.997 --> 31:16.707
I never want to
forget this moment.

31:16.707 --> 31:18.542
I want it etched
in my memory forever.

31:18.542 --> 31:20.503
Forever and ever.

31:20.503 --> 31:21.754
See? Told you all.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.839
Sex offender.

31:23.839 --> 31:26.050
Why are we
carrying rodents, 19?

31:26.050 --> 31:27.760
Because we're saving the lives
of untold millions.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.262
Y'know. Like we do.

31:41.399 --> 31:42.525
I need a drink.

31:42.525 --> 31:43.734
Don't say "drink."

31:43.734 --> 31:44.986
Hair of the dog?
Mnh‐mnh.

31:44.986 --> 31:47.154
Oof. Today was ‐‐
 Ugh.

31:47.154 --> 31:48.406
Oh, come on, guys.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.991
Look, Dixon is fired.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.409
And in jail.
Right?

31:51.409 --> 31:52.576
We gotta at least
celebrate that.

31:52.576 --> 31:53.536
Okay, sure.

31:53.536 --> 31:55.371
Okay. I'm down.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.832
Pru's still
at my sister's.

31:57.832 --> 32:00.126
Ding dong, Dixon is dead.

32:00.126 --> 32:02.211
Yes, he is.
Come on. Let's go.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.879
Oh, shut up.
Hey.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.303
I was so stupid.

32:52.303 --> 32:55.681
Everyone saw the truth
about my dad but me.

32:55.681 --> 32:57.183
Everyone.

33:01.520 --> 33:04.398
It's how these things
usually go.

33:04.398 --> 33:07.651
I ruined the best relationship
I ever had because of him.

33:07.651 --> 33:11.030
You could apologize.

33:11.030 --> 33:13.407
It's too late for that.
Way too late.

33:15.576 --> 33:18.245
You'd be surprised how far
an "I'm sorry" can get you.

33:28.255 --> 33:30.007
I'm sorry, Jack.

33:32.927 --> 33:34.428
We're all going to
the houseboat.

33:34.428 --> 33:38.349
We're gonna raise a glass
to Dixon's demise.

33:38.349 --> 33:41.769
No. I can't.

33:41.769 --> 33:43.062
Have fun.

33:45.898 --> 33:46.899
Hair looks
kinda cool.

34:05.584 --> 34:07.878
If I had died today,
Miranda would have killed me.

34:07.878 --> 34:09.755
Miranda would have
killed all of us

34:09.755 --> 34:11.005
if we'd let you die.

34:11.005 --> 34:11.966
Yeah, well,
if I had died today,

34:11.966 --> 34:13.425
you'd all already
be dead, too.

34:13.425 --> 34:15.219
I'd like to
propose a toast.
 Ooh, yeah.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.512
To Dr. Ben Warren ‐‐
Aww.

34:16.512 --> 34:19.389
Though he may
be judgmental...

34:19.389 --> 34:20.766
...he holds us
all accountable.

34:20.766 --> 34:22.351
That's true,
especially Sullivan.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.811
Also,
with Pruitt gone,

34:23.811 --> 34:25.312
I think we're looking for
a new father figure.

34:25.312 --> 34:26.981
Okay, you call me old
one more time,

34:26.981 --> 34:28.899
I'm gonna send you to bed
without your dinner, young lady.

34:28.899 --> 34:30.693
Yeah. Oh!
But seriously, though,

34:30.693 --> 34:32.319
can you think of a better way
to honor Pruitt Herrera

34:32.319 --> 34:33.696
than bringing down
that asshat?

34:33.696 --> 34:34.530
No. Mm.

34:34.530 --> 34:35.989
Sorry, probie.

34:35.989 --> 34:38.199
No, don't be.
My dad is an asshat.
Mm‐hmm.

34:38.199 --> 34:39.493
And I'm not
a probie anymore.

34:39.493 --> 34:41.120
Yeah, you'll always be
probie to us.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.746
 You know what?
No more crying.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.206
We're here.
We're still breathing.
 Always be a probie.

34:45.206 --> 34:47.668
So let's
act like it.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.378
Alright, get ready
to dance!

34:49.378 --> 34:51.630
Hooooo!

34:52.922 --> 34:54.382
Come on, Jack.
Come on.

34:54.382 --> 34:56.051
Come on!
No, no, no,
I‐I don't ‐‐

34:56.051 --> 34:58.471
Dance, Jack.
Come on, Jack.
I ‐‐ I'm just
gonna watch.

34:58.471 --> 35:00.514
That came out weird,
but, you know, I'm just gonna ‐‐

35:00.514 --> 35:02.099
Oh, whatever!
You guys are good.

35:02.099 --> 35:03.350
Whoa!
Wow.

35:03.350 --> 35:04.935
Coming in hot!

35:04.935 --> 35:06.937
Hey, uh, can I talk to you
for a minute...

35:06.937 --> 35:08.022
Sure.
...outside?

35:08.022 --> 35:09.607
Yeah.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.526
 I didn't know
it was that kind of party.

35:17.781 --> 35:19.783
I think you would have done
okay today.

35:19.783 --> 35:22.578
What? Bombs? Mice?
No.

35:22.578 --> 35:23.704
Oh, you were joking.

35:23.704 --> 35:25.831
Yeah, I'm joking.
Yeah. Of course.

35:25.831 --> 35:27.833
Side to side.
Do the shoulder.
Yeah.

35:27.833 --> 35:30.169
Shoulders?
No, cut ‐‐
cut shoulders.

35:30.169 --> 35:31.378
Cut shoulders.
Cut shoulders. Just feet.

35:31.378 --> 35:36.050
Look, uh, I know that I have
a lot to learn about...

35:36.050 --> 35:37.092
pretty much
everything.

35:38.636 --> 35:39.845
But you got me here.

35:39.845 --> 35:40.971
No, you did this,
Emmett.

35:40.971 --> 35:42.890
No, I couldn't have done this
without you.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.767
And I owe you
so much.

35:44.767 --> 35:46.644
I admire you
so much.

35:46.644 --> 35:50.940
And...I'm so grateful
for you, Travis.

35:52.858 --> 35:54.693
I love you.

36:02.076 --> 36:04.453
I, um...

36:04.453 --> 36:06.372
I am really
happy for you,

36:06.372 --> 36:09.583
you know, for how far
you've come...

36:09.583 --> 36:14.713
for all this life
that you have ahead of you.

36:14.713 --> 36:18.842
And I am really sorry...

36:18.842 --> 36:20.469
that I don't
love you back.

36:30.145 --> 36:33.566
Yeah. Me too.

36:48.706 --> 36:51.959
Carina.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.168
What do you want?

36:53.168 --> 36:54.587
I'm an idiot.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.088
You were right.
I was abused.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.840
My dad was abusive,
but that is no excuse

36:57.840 --> 36:59.174
for what I did to you,
and ‐‐

37:00.551 --> 37:03.512
Just please, please,
please take me back.

37:03.512 --> 37:05.514
I love you.

37:05.514 --> 37:07.850
And I've never said that
about anyone before,

37:07.850 --> 37:09.643
except my brother,
so it means something.

37:09.643 --> 37:12.980
I love you, Carina.

37:12.980 --> 37:15.983
I am sorry.
I'm sorry.

37:17.526 --> 37:19.737
I'm sorry.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.031
Just please forgive me.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.782
Oh, my God.
Forgive her.
Ah!

37:23.782 --> 37:25.326
Sorry. Sorry.
I ‐‐

37:25.326 --> 37:27.661
She cheated on me
with her ex‐boyfriend.

37:27.661 --> 37:31.040
A‐And then you throw it
in my face just to hurt me,

37:31.040 --> 37:33.083
and what am I
supposed to do now?

37:33.083 --> 37:36.003
Forget that?
Am I supposed to trust you?

37:36.003 --> 37:37.880
I don't know.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.923
I don't know.

37:41.425 --> 37:43.886
But I'm okay spending every day
trying to convince you to.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.143
Forgive her.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.436
Oh...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.730
It just ‐‐ If you love her,
forgive her.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.284
I love you, Maya.

38:08.744 --> 38:10.496
Unh!

38:10.496 --> 38:12.373
Come kiss me.

38:23.300 --> 38:24.760
Hey.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.389
Ah!

38:29.348 --> 38:30.808
Yeah.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.101
What are
we watching?

38:32.101 --> 38:35.020
Uh, whatever it is,
it's awful.

38:35.020 --> 38:35.979
Right, Marcus?

38:38.691 --> 38:39.608
You're getting better.

38:39.608 --> 38:40.609
Yeah.
Eh.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.367
Hey.
Hey.

38:59.962 --> 39:01.839
Uh, we ‐‐

39:01.839 --> 39:03.590
Maybe we should
look it up, yeah?

39:14.476 --> 39:16.562
You were, like,
really amazing today.

39:16.562 --> 39:17.980
Oh, I was?

39:17.980 --> 39:19.940
Seriously.
That bomb squad stuff?

39:19.940 --> 39:21.900
Damn, Miller.

39:21.900 --> 39:22.901
Ugh.

39:22.901 --> 39:25.362
Aww, shucks.

39:25.362 --> 39:26.697
I mean, I probably would have
done the same thing,

39:26.697 --> 39:27.865
but like an idiot,

39:27.865 --> 39:28.824
and you actually knew
what you were doing.

39:28.824 --> 39:30.117
It was pretty hot.

39:30.117 --> 39:31.452
You got to
capitalize on that.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.495
I think you should
move out.

39:33.495 --> 39:35.122
What?

39:36.749 --> 39:38.041
I, um ‐‐

39:38.041 --> 39:40.836
I think you should
move out of the houseboat.

39:43.672 --> 39:46.467
Okay, is this because
I s‐‐ I slept on your bed?

39:46.467 --> 39:49.344
No. It ‐‐ Well ‐‐
Because
that was not ‐‐ I mean...

39:49.344 --> 39:51.263
Yeah.

39:51.263 --> 39:54.057
It's that
and other things.

39:54.057 --> 39:55.768
I'm seeing someone now.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.644
You're ‐‐ You're ‐‐

39:57.644 --> 39:59.271
You're a girl,
and it's confusing.

39:59.271 --> 40:01.523
It's ‐‐
I'm not confused.

40:01.523 --> 40:04.067
I mean, I'm confused right now,
but what...

40:06.403 --> 40:08.322
We're friends, Miller.
Yeah.

40:08.322 --> 40:09.448
Right?
Yes, we are,

40:09.448 --> 40:11.700
and I want it
to stay that way,

40:11.700 --> 40:14.912
but it's just been confusing
for ‐‐ for Sasha.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.038
It's been confusing
for Sasha.
For Sa‐‐

40:16.038 --> 40:17.247
Okay, so you're gonna
kick me out

40:17.247 --> 40:18.540
for some girl you've been on
three dates with?

40:18.540 --> 40:20.292
No, no.
It's also confusing for Pru.

40:20.292 --> 40:21.418
For Pru?
Yes, for Pru!

40:21.418 --> 40:22.628
Okay, well ‐‐
When she gets older!

40:22.628 --> 40:24.546
Well, then I'll leave
in two years, Miller.

40:24.546 --> 40:26.507
What the hell?

40:31.762 --> 40:33.555
You have to go somewhere.

40:33.555 --> 40:35.557
You have to find
another place.

40:35.557 --> 40:37.893
I'm grateful
for all the help,

40:37.893 --> 40:38.769
you know,
with me and Pru,

40:38.769 --> 40:39.978
but it's time.

40:41.855 --> 40:43.816
It's time.
You have to go.

40:54.618 --> 40:55.911
Okay.

41:18.350 --> 41:21.311
Aah! Aah.

41:27.234 --> 41:29.236
Uh, Dr. Shepherd ordered
morphine as needed.

41:29.236 --> 41:30.904
I‐I need it!
I need it!

41:30.904 --> 41:31.947
I need it.

41:31.947 --> 41:33.407
I need it!

41:34.700 --> 41:36.827
I need it!
Okay.

42:00.726 --> 42:03.228
What's wrong, Mami?

42:03.228 --> 42:05.439
We had a fun day today.

42:05.439 --> 42:08.317
Sí, mi amor.
We had a beautiful day today.

42:38.764 --> 42:40.265
Tía.
Oh, Andy.

42:40.265 --> 42:42.809
It's been too long.

42:42.809 --> 42:45.979
Your mom...
is sick, Andrea.

42:45.979 --> 42:48.774
She's very sick.

42:48.774 --> 42:50.400
But everything's
gonna be okay.

42:57.866 --> 42:59.618
Tía, just ‐‐ just tell me.

42:59.618 --> 43:01.620
Just ‐‐ Just tell me.

43:01.620 --> 43:03.121
Did my mom...

43:03.121 --> 43:04.539
Andy.
