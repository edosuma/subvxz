WEBVTT

00:01.419 --> 00:03.410
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.504 --> 00:05.540
Distillate of Lake.

00:05.631 --> 00:07.246
One whiff and the pain is gone.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.627
She says they help you
forget Aeryn.

00:10.219 --> 00:11.379
When I double the dose.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.597
What do you desire
with wormholes?

00:13.681 --> 00:16.673
For starters? Go home.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.474
(yelling)

00:20.521 --> 00:22.682
That's Earth.

00:22.773 --> 00:25.230
Your place of origin is where
you can do the most damage.

00:25.318 --> 00:31.735
Crichton's DNA which I provided
for you will enable you to
detect his presence.

00:31.824 --> 00:36.284
So when he returns, as we know
he will, capture him alive.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.578
D'Argo:
Pilot, I've got Crichton.
We're coming aboard.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.715
Welcome home, son.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.558
We've been waiting for
you a long time.

01:04.315 --> 01:06.522
What's the matter, John?

01:06.609 --> 01:10.568
Was it a bass or a trout?

01:11.614 --> 01:14.606
And now, on Farscape.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.110
They're not impostors.

01:16.202 --> 01:20.320
DRD scans confirm they
are of your species.

01:21.332 --> 01:23.744
It's me, son.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.291
It's all right. You're home.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.337
And you're alive.

01:29.423 --> 01:34.383
And if that wasn't miracle
enough, this ship is actually
a living organism?

01:35.304 --> 01:37.295
Yeah, she is.

01:37.390 --> 01:38.926
And her.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.348
Another alien life-form.

01:42.478 --> 01:44.343
How'd you get up here?

01:44.438 --> 01:48.647
We sent a shuttle, to open
up communications.

01:48.734 --> 01:52.226
Everyone at IASA had a coronary
when she answered, finally.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.403
In English.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.243
She's too smart.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.991
Holt:
Commander Crichton.

02:03.082 --> 02:06.916
I am T.R. Holt, Special Advisor
to the President.

02:07.003 --> 02:08.709
Congratulations.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.538
You have accomplished something
truly momentous.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.374
Earth's first contact with
extraterrestrial life.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.550
( chuckles )

02:16.637 --> 02:20.175
Well, T.R.,

02:20.266 --> 02:23.349
today's your lucky day.

02:23.436 --> 02:24.391
D'Argol

02:24.478 --> 02:25.979
Aeryn!

02:31.193 --> 02:34.356
Just don't make any
sudden moves.

02:39.410 --> 02:40.866
Good God.

02:58.179 --> 03:01.296
What delayed you? Moya arrived
42 of their days ago.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.767
The wormhole's unstable.
Some time dilation may
have occurred.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.216
Where the hell is Scorpius?

03:05.311 --> 03:06.721
He's in a pod, at the far end
of this wormhole.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.098
He's transmitting us a signal,
so we can find our way back.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.805
Yeah, you can stop pimping
for him anytime.

03:10.900 --> 03:13.312
What is wrong with you?
These are your people.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.233
Or do you think they
pose us a threat?

03:15.321 --> 03:17.562
No.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.817
It's the other way around.

03:25.122 --> 03:29.035
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.618
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.499
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

03:34.590 --> 03:37.798
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

03:37.885 --> 03:39.625
my friends.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.552
I've made enemies.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.882
Powerful, dangerous.

03:45.976 --> 03:49.468
Now all I want is to
find a way home

03:49.563 --> 03:52.270
to warn Earth.

03:52.358 --> 03:57.443
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.150
Earth.

04:42.241 --> 04:45.108
Terra firma.

04:45.202 --> 04:48.410
Seems forever it's filled my
thoughts, been my goal

04:48.497 --> 04:51.989
and now... I'm here.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.041
Family, friends...

04:58.132 --> 05:01.841
seeing them again is so...
so normal.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.508
John, you're alive.

05:03.596 --> 05:05.882
D.K., when did that happen?

05:05.973 --> 05:07.133
Two years ago.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.215
Married on a boat in Naples.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.891
| wish you could've been there.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.263
You said he was a geek.

05:12.354 --> 05:15.266
He is a geek.
-I won her over anyway.

05:15.357 --> 05:20.977
I figured Earth would freak out
and it's delivered in spades,
on time, 30 minutes or less.

05:23.365 --> 05:27.574
Uncle Sam is keeping the aliens
safe and contained.

05:27.661 --> 05:32.906
A waterfront mansion for their
personal use and full security
team standing by.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.416
It's a cage.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.916
But at least it's a gilded one.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.417
Good?

05:46.347 --> 05:49.965
Of course, the suits are more
interested in the technology.

05:50.059 --> 05:51.640
No surprise there.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.342
So we let 'em look.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.393
We don't usually recommend
this setting.

05:55.481 --> 06:00.020
They just can't comprehend what
they're looking at, much less
replicate it.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.145
Be careful.

06:01.237 --> 06:02.818
Not yet.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.816
So let 'em look.

06:07.743 --> 06:11.281
Some of the VIPs have accepted
translator microbes.

06:11.372 --> 06:15.115
(speaking Luxan )

06:15.209 --> 06:19.248
...under strict supervision.
No power ups unless I...

06:19.338 --> 06:22.626
But even translator microbes
aren't gonna help some
people listen.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.549
Not that you can blame them.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.673
(yells in Luxan)

06:31.350 --> 06:34.934
At least the alien life's
not going too crazy.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.978
My family has been helping out.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.226
Would you like me to bring
you some of my clothes?

06:40.317 --> 06:45.653
My sister Olivia, she's
hanging with 'em.
-Sure. Thanks.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.195
And my cousin Bobby.

06:47.283 --> 06:51.151
Bobby is totally fascinated
by the E.T.s.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.281
Hey. I got this great idea.

06:53.372 --> 06:56.705
How about... how about we break
out of here, and go make
some new friends.

06:56.792 --> 06:59.579
Chiana, you know the humans
will not let us out unescorted.

06:59.670 --> 07:03.834
And the way you make friends,
I do not blame them.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.300
Rygel, have you tried this?

07:05.384 --> 07:07.170
Sparky and Wrinkles?
-Another delicacy.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.217
They're the happiest
of the crew.

07:09.305 --> 07:11.296
They're in gastro heaven.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.596
What's it called?

07:12.683 --> 07:15.015
It's called cop-porn.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.219
But T.R. Holt, he is not happy.

07:18.314 --> 07:21.306
What's the big deal?
It's a simple proposal.

07:21.400 --> 07:25.234
A trip on a spaceship for 500
of Earth's best and brightest.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.858
Yeah, but who picks
the 500, you?

07:27.948 --> 07:30.155
Me? No, no, no.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.619
Let UNESCO handle that,
or the Nobel committee.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.443
Be much simpler to
keep it local.

07:34.538 --> 07:39.373
Local meaning only
red-blooded Americans.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.416
No deal. No cookie.

07:41.503 --> 07:45.837
Some would disagree. Quote,
"The Farscape project was and
is an American initiative.

07:45.924 --> 07:49.633
I do not think it is unfair
that America should reap the
first benefits of it."

07:49.720 --> 07:51.927
Yeah, what big-hearted
patriot said that?

07:52.014 --> 07:56.633
A former astronaut by the
name of Jack Crichton.

07:56.727 --> 08:01.187
Did you know we're making him
lASA's Project Director for
Extraterrestrial Studies?

08:01.273 --> 08:05.357
Father and son. Dynamite P.R.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.810
Jack is just so happy to be
making a contribution.

08:07.905 --> 08:10.647
Don't screw it up for him.

08:10.741 --> 08:13.027
That's a nice suit.

08:13.118 --> 08:16.485
Do you have to buy that or does
it come standard issue?

08:21.627 --> 08:25.119
Which brings us to Dad.

08:25.214 --> 08:26.795
Dad...

08:26.882 --> 08:28.964
Jack:
All right, time for lighting
test. T minus...

08:29.051 --> 08:31.007
Dad's world is upside down.

08:31.095 --> 08:35.259
So he's trying to make it
right side up by putting up
Christmas decorations.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.180
Great.
-Might need a little more...

08:37.267 --> 08:39.974
Christmas decorations even
though it's Florida

08:40.062 --> 08:43.020
and the whole block is
cordoned off with security.

08:43.107 --> 08:46.270
Please, back, sir.

08:46.360 --> 08:50.399
Family traditions. They're
supposed to bring us together,

08:50.489 --> 08:53.526
and to make everything normal.

08:53.617 --> 08:56.074
So, you do this every cycle?

08:56.161 --> 08:58.743
Year. Every year.
-Year. Year.

08:58.831 --> 09:02.744
Christmas has always been
our favorite holiday.
We never get tired of it.

09:02.835 --> 09:05.076
I love that Christmas where you
lit the fire in the fireplace

09:05.170 --> 09:09.334
and the smoke came back down
because Mr. Jingles
was in the flue!

09:09.425 --> 09:11.916
Oh, come on. One little
mistake, you're gonna
hold it against me.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.422
How was I supppose to know
he was up there?
-The cat didn't have hair for three months, Dad.

09:14.513 --> 09:17.346
What the frell is that?
-Remember we gave you riding
lessons,honey?

09:17.433 --> 09:19.469
Thought you were gonna cry.
-I did cry.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.221
A cat?
-Yeah, it's a pet.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.438
Hey, and this.
-Does he talk?

09:23.522 --> 09:25.137
Baby, remember this that
your brother made?

09:25.232 --> 09:27.348
(laughs):
Yeah. Show him.

09:27.443 --> 09:29.149
Remember this, John?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.147
Made this when you were
five years old.
Your mother loved it.

09:31.238 --> 09:35.277
Crichton:
So what's next, we break out
the bare-ass baby pictures?

09:35.367 --> 09:38.530
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
Let me get the photo album.
-Yeah, let's take a vote. Aeryn?

09:38.620 --> 09:41.362
Of course.
-No, we're not gonna... your
not looking at my bare ass.

09:41.457 --> 09:43.322
Why not? I've seen it all ready.
-Yes, we are.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.874
(door chimes)
Excuse me, I hear the door.
I got it.

09:45.961 --> 09:49.328
Jack:
Here, let me, ah, let me
show you this.

09:49.423 --> 09:53.416
Special delivery from the
ghost of Christmas past.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.377
Caroline.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.347
Welcome back to terra firma.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.604
Hey, um...

10:08.692 --> 10:10.603
Caroline's here. Come on in.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.230
But things have changed.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.277
Jack:
Hi, Caroline. Come on in.
-Hey, Jack.

10:14.364 --> 10:18.198
We don't get to close our eyes
and pretend they haven't.

10:18.285 --> 10:23.825
And everyone is telling me
how different I am.

10:23.916 --> 10:25.702
They're right.

10:25.793 --> 10:29.001
But they don't have a clue why.

10:29.087 --> 10:34.252
They can't know what I've seen,
what I've done,

10:34.343 --> 10:37.301
what's been done to me.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.639
They can't know what's out
there waiting for them

10:39.723 --> 10:44.262
and I can't tell them because
they wouldn't believe me.

10:44.353 --> 10:48.221
Hell, if I tried,
they'd lock me up.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.431
Frell, I'd lock me up.

10:53.237 --> 10:55.148
Hey, Buck Rogers.

10:55.239 --> 10:58.731
You're supposed to be fishing
not writing memoirs.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.658
What's that?

11:01.745 --> 11:04.578
It's homework.

11:04.665 --> 11:08.453
This was supposed to be
a weekend off.

11:08.544 --> 11:14.961
No homework, no stress,
no aliens, no demands.

11:28.397 --> 11:32.310
Man on TV:
Mankind has always seen himself
as the center of the universe.

11:32.401 --> 11:35.359
To discover that's no longer
true is highly traumatic.

11:35.445 --> 11:39.233
A fundamental status quo is
being threatened here.

11:39.324 --> 11:44.193
The very existence of Homo
sapiens may be under threat.

11:44.288 --> 11:47.496
It's hardly surprising the
hysteria is rising.
-Here.

11:47.583 --> 11:50.074
Interviewer:
Hysteria? In what sense?

11:50.168 --> 11:54.537
The presence of these alien has
induced various forms of
societal hysteria. -No, thanks.

11:54.631 --> 11:58.089
Holt says it's bad on the
political front.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.792
Every nation's demanding
equal access to the aliens

12:00.888 --> 12:02.924
and all the information
we get from them.

12:03.015 --> 12:05.176
Of course they are.
We're gonna give it to them.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.258
I don't see why.

12:07.352 --> 12:11.015
Why should we give them access
to technology they can
use against us?

12:11.106 --> 12:13.313
'Cause it's the right
thing to do.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.140
Wouldn't worry about it, Dad.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.147
Subcommittee'll tie it up for
years and load it down with a
ton of guidelines.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.615
Now you're being naive, son.

12:20.699 --> 12:24.237
The best and safest thing to do
is keep it to ourselves.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.362
Space travel was your dream
to unite mankind.

12:30.626 --> 12:33.117
September the eleventh.

12:33.211 --> 12:36.874
This isn't the same world you
left four years ago, son.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.342
People don't dream like
they used to.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.337
It's about survival now.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.383
Who's survival?

12:42.471 --> 12:44.211
Olivia's survival.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.968
And Susan and Frank and Bobby's.

12:47.059 --> 12:49.892
Imagine them blown up
by a suicide bomb,

12:49.978 --> 12:53.311
or coughing up blood from
a poison gas attack.

12:53.398 --> 12:56.310
This country is under siege.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.357
You just don't understand
the global situation.

12:58.445 --> 13:02.233
I don't understand because I've
been out of town, or because
Daddy knows best?

13:02.324 --> 13:05.066
Oh, come on.
Now that's not fair, son.

13:05.160 --> 13:09.028
If you wanna argue with Holt or
even the President, I can
arrange that.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.623
No, I don't wanna argue
with anybody.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.243
No, you don't wanna argue.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.949
You just wanna be obstinate and
insist everyone agree with you.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.626
Are you accusing me of being
the only one in this family
to be stubborn?

13:16.713 --> 13:18.249
No. You're the most stubborn.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.377
That I would argue with.
-All right, let's split
the title.

13:22.219 --> 13:26.007
I'm going into space tomorrow.

13:26.098 --> 13:28.805
If you'd like to come along
you're welcome.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.928
Unless you're too stubborn.

13:41.071 --> 13:43.027
(growling)

13:55.210 --> 13:56.165
Awesome!

13:56.253 --> 13:58.585
Yeah, and this is just
the garage.

13:58.672 --> 13:59.832
Come on, show me more.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.335
No, I got some stuff I
gotta do first. 1812!

14:02.426 --> 14:04.337
I've give him the tour, son.
I know my way around.

14:04.428 --> 14:07.465
No, Jack, it's a big ship.
You're gonna need a Sherpa.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.763
Give me that arm.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.592
This should fix it up.
It's a miracle.

14:15.397 --> 14:18.264
1812, this is Bobby.
Bobby, this is 1812.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.690
1812 is gonna be your
tour guide.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.108
Don't let 'em break anything.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.776
I won't break anything.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.946
Where's that Pilot you
told me about?

14:26.033 --> 14:28.240
I'll show you.
You won't believe it.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.486
Jack...

14:29.578 --> 14:31.443
that way.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.868
Think they know how to
open doors?

14:35.959 --> 14:39.247
D'Argo:
Can you check wormhole
stability from Command, or do you need to go outside again?

14:39.337 --> 14:40.998
No, Command will be fine.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.750
I've had enough EVA to
last a lifetime.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.253
Apparently all systems check
out normal with the Prowler

14:45.343 --> 14:47.800
so the scientists don't seem to
have caused any damage.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.128
I made sure they didn't.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.134
I appreciate it. Thank you.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.552
Okay...

14:56.646 --> 14:59.103
Meet you on Command.

14:59.191 --> 15:01.307
Thank you.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.019
Aeryn, listen up. You got a
problem with them poking around
at your Prowler,

15:05.113 --> 15:06.728
why don't you leave it here?

15:06.823 --> 15:11.032
The IASA boys got enough to
look at with D'Argo's guppy
and my module.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.200
Would it be better if I stayed
here as well?

15:16.291 --> 15:19.124
Why would you wanna do that?

15:19.211 --> 15:21.793
I'm clearly not fitting in.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.338
You're fitting in as well
as any of us are.

15:27.803 --> 15:30.340
Whatever. It's...
it's up to you.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.671
It's up to me?
-Yeah.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.890
Yeah, it's up to you.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.264
Fine. I...

15:38.355 --> 15:41.188
Well, I don't mind your
scientists poking around
with my Prowler.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.107
I can even field-strip
a cannon if...

15:44.194 --> 15:46.936
No, don't do that.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.941
Thank you, but...

15:49.032 --> 15:51.318
don't do that.
They've seen enough.

15:59.376 --> 16:00.206
Crichton:
You want a hand?

16:00.293 --> 16:02.909
Aeryn:
Nope.

16:03.004 --> 16:05.416
No. No, of course you don't.

16:05.507 --> 16:08.419
( low growl )

16:12.681 --> 16:15.172
Braca:
What is that?

16:15.267 --> 16:17.883
An explanation would
be pointless.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.890
You'd retain no memory of it.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.518
(gasps )

16:26.653 --> 16:31.272
Skreeth, can you hear me?
It's Grayza. Report.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.197
( Skreeth's voice ):
I hear you.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.989
Crichton is onboard Moya.

16:37.080 --> 16:41.619
According to reports, Moya now
orbits Crichton's home planet.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.291
Grayza:
Where is this planet?

16:43.378 --> 16:45.539
Unknown. We traveled through
a wormhole to reach it.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.121
A wormhole?
-Yes.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.377
Are you certain?
-Yes.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.800
Do not seize Crichton yet.

16:52.888 --> 16:59.760
Learn all you can about his
planet, its technology, its
defenses and its location.

16:59.853 --> 17:03.641
Skeeth:
Allowing me to interrogate
Crichton will yield quicker answers.

17:03.732 --> 17:08.692
Crichton has already proven
himself to be immune to several
forms of interrogation.

17:08.778 --> 17:12.191
Stay hidden until we know more.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.193
Understood?

17:14.618 --> 17:16.358
Understood.

17:18.705 --> 17:21.242
(gasps )

17:25.337 --> 17:29.751
We took a short break,
for recreation.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.673
(normal voice ):
I see.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.218
Don't you remember, Captain?

17:35.305 --> 17:40.345
Perhaps you will next time.

17:42.354 --> 17:43.685
But duty first.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.434
Run a full weapons systems
check immediately.

17:46.524 --> 17:51.063
I want this ship ready
to destroy a planet.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.314
Crichton:
The readings match my homework.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.320
It's gonna be at least 70 arns
before the wormhole's
stable enough

17:58.411 --> 18:00.527
for Moya to get back through.

18:00.622 --> 18:04.206
Pilot says he and Moya are
looking forward to giving humans
their first trip to the stars.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.372
Yeah, right.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.701
They're not going, are they?

18:07.796 --> 18:11.129
No, we'll be long gone while
they're still bickering over
who gets the tickets.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.207
Well, then why offer them
in the first place?

18:13.301 --> 18:15.292
Gotta give 'em something,
otherwise they'll try
and take it.

18:15.387 --> 18:17.127
Yeah, but we're not giving
them anything.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.338
Their scientists can't even work
out how to use Pulse Pistols.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.640
Doesn't matter. My planet
doesn't have Chakan oil anyway.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.558
Don't look at me like that.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.560
You know how paranoid
my planet is.

18:29.651 --> 18:32.267
Yeah, they... they don't
like aliens.

18:32.362 --> 18:35.354
They don't like anybody.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.404
Well, I'm glad to see you
taking a positive approach.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.949
Cooperation, teamwork,
distraction.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.197
We give them a few hints then
we get the hell out of Dodge

18:42.289 --> 18:46.453
and hope they get their act
together before the real
space monsters show up.

18:46.543 --> 18:49.125
Aeryn? Have you seen John?

18:49.212 --> 18:50.952
Pilot says he's ready
to head back down.

18:51.047 --> 18:53.129
So am I. Would you like
a lift in my Prowler?

18:53.216 --> 18:56.208
Go for it, Jack. She's the
best pilot I've ever seen.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.885
Think you can manage a
side trip to the moon?

18:58.972 --> 19:01.258
I think I can do better
than that.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.806
(engine roaring)

19:06.438 --> 19:11.523
Jack (chuckling ):
Saturn. I'm really looking
at Saturn.

19:11.609 --> 19:15.397
I'm farther from Earth than
any human's ever been.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.230
Actually, no.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.236
(chuckling):
Oh yeah.

19:20.327 --> 19:23.819
I guess my son does have
a few miles on me.

19:23.913 --> 19:27.201
He must be happy to be
back on Earth, though.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.158
I don't know.

19:30.253 --> 19:32.289
He's having a tough time
readjusting.

19:32.380 --> 19:37.090
He, uh... he doesn't talk much
about what he's been through.

19:37.969 --> 19:40.631
Not even about his shipmates?

19:40.722 --> 19:45.182
Oh, he-he... he's talked about
your societies, customs.

19:45.268 --> 19:46.633
Remarkable stuff.

19:46.728 --> 19:50.687
He thinks that your species and
mine might somehow be linked.

19:50.774 --> 19:54.733
Our geneticists are still
looking at that.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.935
But I wouldn't be surprised.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.692
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were human.

19:59.783 --> 20:02.195
I'm not.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.196
Do you wish you were?

20:05.455 --> 20:08.162
Why do you ask?

20:08.249 --> 20:11.582
You have feelings for
John, don't you?

20:14.255 --> 20:16.120
Does that shock you?

20:16.216 --> 20:18.423
No.

20:18.510 --> 20:24.096
I suppose it might if I thought
of you as an alien life-form,
but I don't.

20:26.017 --> 20:33.435
John has not said anything to
me, but I believe he has
feelings for you, too.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.404
He did.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.319
Now...

20:40.407 --> 20:41.613
Now he's home.

20:41.699 --> 20:45.237
That's one of the things he's
gonna to have to sort out.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.569
Just give him time.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.779
Hmm.

20:49.874 --> 20:53.241
(engine roaring)

20:54.963 --> 20:57.170
Sikozu:
Biologic examination?

20:57.257 --> 21:01.591
I said no, and I don't care
how many of the others
have consented.

21:01.678 --> 21:05.136
You can go stick your probes
in one of them.
I'm not interested.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.259
Chiana:
Well, you never know.
You might like it.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.932
No, I will not have an x-ray.

21:10.019 --> 21:14.012
I don't care how much it
advances mankind's
xenobiological knowledge.

21:14.107 --> 21:17.440
N... Leave!

21:17.527 --> 21:20.735
Rygel:
Eat something.
You'll feel better.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.528
I do not want to eat.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.106
I want to go back to Moya.

21:25.201 --> 21:28.364
Good. Here... here, give
this to Pilot.

21:28.455 --> 21:31.697
Noranti: (with music):
Hark! The hee rawld
angles seen guh

21:31.791 --> 21:35.625
Glowry to the nude
bored keen guh
-Chiana: nude...

21:35.712 --> 21:38.419
Peach on Erp and murky mill ed

21:38.506 --> 21:42.840
Gode and signers
reek n sill ed...
-Chiana: murky... sill ed...

21:43.470 --> 21:45.256
It was incredible.

21:45.346 --> 21:49.134
We flew through the Cassini
division, beat the Cassini
space probe by a year.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.217
Told Aeryn it was the best
Christmas present I'd
ever gotten,

21:52.312 --> 21:57.181
except for that tie rack you
made me in junior high school.

21:57.275 --> 22:00.642
Speaking of suits and ties,

22:00.737 --> 22:05.902
Holt is still fighting me on
the tech-sharing plan and the
explorer selection process.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.358
I could use a little support.

22:08.453 --> 22:12.287
I've always supported you
as much as I could, son.

22:12.373 --> 22:15.786
You're not looking at the
bigger picture here.

22:15.877 --> 22:18.118
You don't see the big picture.

22:18.213 --> 22:20.625
You can't conceive of it.

22:20.715 --> 22:22.922
Earth has to work
together on this.

22:23.009 --> 22:26.797
Yeah. Well, you're asking the
impossible on that one.

22:26.888 --> 22:30.255
Impossible. "Impossible is not
in our vocabulary."

22:30.350 --> 22:33.308
Who said that? You. You did.

22:33.394 --> 22:37.307
Four days before you set
foot on the moon.

22:37.398 --> 22:39.229
You taught me to believe that.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.182
That belief kept me alive.

22:41.277 --> 22:44.735
Please tell me you still
believe it.

22:50.328 --> 22:53.411
I'm not sure what I
believe anymore.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.804
All this crap you've tacked on.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.095
Hetch drive. FTL.

23:11.182 --> 23:13.138
It can't work.
-It's theoretically impossible.

23:13.226 --> 23:14.841
Theory is wrong.

23:14.936 --> 23:17.052
Newton, Einstein, Hawking.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.273
We prove them wrong every time
we pop out for groceries.

23:19.357 --> 23:21.063
Then tell us how it works.

23:21.150 --> 23:24.142
I didn't design it, D.K. Ijust
installed it. That's for you
to figure out.

23:24.237 --> 23:25.647
Sure, drop it in our laps.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.319
Let us scratch our heads
and look stupid

23:27.407 --> 23:29.568
while you go on Nightline or
have lunch with the president.

23:29.659 --> 23:33.823
Laura:
We need some help. We're
Neanderthals trying to understand 747s.

23:33.913 --> 23:37.280
These new laptops are
really nice.

23:38.293 --> 23:41.535
Laura, I cannot tell you
what I don't know.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.540
Then why'd you bring us
these ships?

23:43.631 --> 23:47.419
If we're never gonna learn
anything, why rub our noses
in how dumb we are?

23:47.510 --> 23:49.171
You're not dumb.
-Neither are you.

23:49.262 --> 23:52.800
Taka says you asked for the
metallurgic analysis
of these ships.

23:52.890 --> 23:55.097
You're on the track
of something.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.049
It's just a riddle.

23:57.145 --> 24:00.012
Why do Prowler pilots
turn to goo?

24:00.106 --> 24:01.767
Get back to me on that.

24:01.858 --> 24:05.396
I'm gonna get a refill of
coffee. You guys want some?

24:07.238 --> 24:09.194
(sighs)

24:13.036 --> 24:15.573
( low breathing )

24:17.290 --> 24:19.201
I think something's going on.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.328
I'm sure John is
holding out on us.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.831
Probably trying to grab more
of the glory for himself.

24:23.921 --> 24:27.379
Again. He doesn't care about it.
The only thing John...

24:27.467 --> 24:28.331
(hissing)

24:28.426 --> 24:29.290
( screaming )

24:29.385 --> 24:31.762
( gunshots )

24:33.973 --> 24:35.838
( screaming )

24:36.559 --> 24:38.015
Laura!

24:40.396 --> 24:41.511
No!

24:41.606 --> 24:43.642
( both screaming )

24:44.275 --> 24:46.311
(roaring hiss)

24:48.029 --> 24:50.236
( screaming )

24:50.323 --> 24:53.190
Are you sure that they're
telling you the truth?

24:53.284 --> 24:55.195
( Skeeth's voice ):
I can guarantee it.

24:55.286 --> 25:00.576
Plainly, not all humans have
Crichton's alleged ability to
resist interrogation.

25:00.667 --> 25:04.330
Grayza:
Then Crichton has given
no wormhole information to Earth yet.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.877
No. That knowledge can
die with Crichton.

25:06.964 --> 25:08.875
Not until I have that knowledge.

25:08.966 --> 25:11.708
I'm confident I can
capture him.

25:11.803 --> 25:14.419
But doubt I can bring
him to you.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.300
Nor can I yet come to you.

25:16.391 --> 25:20.304
Wherever this Earth is the
journey there is obviously
impractical

25:20.395 --> 25:22.226
without wormhole travel.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.224
And only Crichton can
command that.

25:24.315 --> 25:27.182
Then our best alternative
is to seize him,

25:27.276 --> 25:30.234
learn what we can from him,
then execute him.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.313
I'm forced to agree.

25:33.408 --> 25:36.946
Anything more you need
from my captives?

25:38.121 --> 25:39.110
No.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.241
(roaring)

25:43.418 --> 25:46.285
Hey, where you been?

25:46.379 --> 25:48.085
Shopping with aliens.

25:48.172 --> 25:52.916
They closed off the whole mall
and the store owners, I'm sure,
were very annoyed.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.922
I'm sure they love it.
It'll be in their ads tomorrow.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.550
Not to mention something to
tell their grandkids.

25:58.641 --> 25:59.801
What are you doing?

25:59.892 --> 26:02.634
Mmm, nothing.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.515
What's wrong?

26:04.605 --> 26:06.766
Nothing.

26:06.858 --> 26:09.349
Do you wanna go live
in the past?

26:09.444 --> 26:12.311
No, thank you.
I have been there.

26:12.405 --> 26:15.147
Well, where do you wanna live?

26:15.241 --> 26:17.197
I don't know.

26:19.120 --> 26:21.657
You tell me. Where do I belong?

26:22.874 --> 26:25.286
Well, do you miss this life?

26:27.086 --> 26:34.299
I look at these pictures,
and I recognize the faces.

26:34.385 --> 26:36.376
Some of the places.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.629
But it's not my life.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.011
I miss her.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.146
I miss that chick.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.102
(both laugh)

26:55.198 --> 26:57.484
I miss him, but I can't...
He's changed.

26:57.575 --> 27:00.362
What, he's changed so much
that you can't talk to him?

27:00.453 --> 27:03.195
You know, he says exactly the
same thing about you.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.790
"He's changed so much and..."

27:04.874 --> 27:07.957
I have changed, and I
can't tell him why.

27:08.044 --> 27:09.659
Why not?

27:09.754 --> 27:14.248
Because he is the Director for
Extraterrestrial Studies,

27:14.342 --> 27:16.754
and what he hears, the
government hears.

27:16.844 --> 27:20.132
Are you saying he can't
keep a confidence?

27:22.308 --> 27:25.220
Coming here was a mistake.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.139
It was an accident,

27:28.231 --> 27:31.473
and it shouldn't have happened.

27:31.567 --> 27:36.561
And there were things that the
government cannot hear.

27:37.782 --> 27:39.488
What, is it bad?

27:40.910 --> 27:46.280
No. No, it's not bad.

27:46.374 --> 27:50.788
(in an E.T. voice)
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

27:50.878 --> 27:53.255
Okay.
-Trust me.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.624
(both laugh)

27:54.715 --> 27:57.206
D'Argo:
So, I see we've been
shopping again.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.587
Aeryn:
Yes. Crichton isn't here, is he?

27:59.679 --> 28:01.340
No, but his cousin is.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.842
He's outside interviewing
Caroline Wallace.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.173
Really?
-Mmm.

28:05.268 --> 28:06.132
Thanks, Chi.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.808
Can you help with this?
-Move.

28:07.895 --> 28:09.351
What'd you do, buy the
whole planet?

28:09.438 --> 28:10.769
It's not mine. It's from Aeryn.

28:10.857 --> 28:14.725
I don't know what it is, but
I... I know it's for Crichton.

28:14.819 --> 28:17.151
It won't get him back.
He hasn't forgiven her.

28:17.238 --> 28:18.398
Oh, he will.

28:18.489 --> 28:20.229
Sooner or later.

28:20.324 --> 28:23.157
Some males can actually forgive.

28:23.244 --> 28:24.609
Ooh, sorry.

28:26.372 --> 28:29.956
So, how long have you
known John Crichton?

28:30.042 --> 28:32.249
I met him six years ago.

28:32.336 --> 28:34.998
And how long have you
been his girlfriend?

28:35.631 --> 28:37.212
Bobby, cut.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.006
Take five.

28:40.261 --> 28:42.547
Don't stop. I'm interested
in the answer.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.845
Wanna tell me why
you wanna know?

28:44.932 --> 28:47.469
That's fair.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.767
John and I were in a
relationship.

28:50.730 --> 28:53.016
What kind of relationship?

28:53.816 --> 28:55.397
It was complicated.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.691
Yeah, I can imagine.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.689
Well, actually, no,
I can't imagine.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.192
John and I had a much
simpler one.

29:02.283 --> 29:07.073
No strings, no plans, just
good, casual times.

29:07.163 --> 29:09.370
Well, at least that's how
it was before.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.790
And now?

29:12.877 --> 29:16.665
Uh, he doesn't even
want that much.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.917
But he's been spending
time with you.

29:19.008 --> 29:21.590
I think he's been
testing himself.

29:21.677 --> 29:24.339
Working out what he
really wants.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.261
It's not me.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.348
I'm sorry.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.140
No, you're not.

29:30.227 --> 29:32.639
You still want him, don't you?

29:34.065 --> 29:37.182
Yes. But it doesn't matter.
He doesn't want me, either.

29:37.276 --> 29:42.441
I think he does. When I asked
him about you, he said there
was nothing going on.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.692
He said that several times.

29:44.784 --> 29:46.240
That's bad.

29:46.327 --> 29:49.239
You have a lot to understand
about humans.

29:49.330 --> 29:51.286
Sometimes when we repeat a lie,

29:51.374 --> 29:54.116
it means that we're trying to
convince ourselves of the truth.

29:54.210 --> 29:56.792
And that is that he
still loves you.

29:56.879 --> 29:58.995
Very much.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.416
Scorpius:
Your head is bruised.

30:03.511 --> 30:06.378
How difficult was your
travel here?

30:06.472 --> 30:09.464
Extremely turbulent,
but not very damaging.

30:09.558 --> 30:12.095
Following your guidance signal
was a great help.

30:12.186 --> 30:14.097
What are you doing?

30:14.188 --> 30:16.349
Cross-coupling the fuel cells.

30:17.817 --> 30:21.730
To turn this pod into a bomb.

30:21.821 --> 30:24.733
This wormhole is traversable.
It leads to Crichton.

30:24.824 --> 30:27.657
Therefore, I cannot have
Grayza find it.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.654
You think her Command Carrier
will return?

30:29.745 --> 30:35.240
My spy aboard the Carrier has
been unable to discern her
current strategies.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.292
But should she return,

30:38.379 --> 30:44.170
as a last resort, I will
detonate this Pod within the
mouth of the wormhole.

30:44.260 --> 30:47.718
That should destabilize it.

30:47.805 --> 30:50.137
But how will you survive?

30:51.642 --> 30:53.428
I wouldn't survive it.

31:00.985 --> 31:07.072
You would have a better chance
of destabilization with...

31:07.158 --> 31:10.650
two Pods?

31:16.375 --> 31:19.117
Would you like to observe
the sequence?

31:26.927 --> 31:29.714
I just spoke to Pilot. Sikozu
went back through the wormhole.

31:29.805 --> 31:31.011
She did what?

31:31.098 --> 31:32.634
She met up with Scorpius.

31:32.725 --> 31:35.011
That son of a bitch. The
wormhole must be stabilizing.

31:35.102 --> 31:36.683
She better not bring that
bastard back through.

31:36.771 --> 31:38.727
No, she says she's not
gonna return to Earth.

31:38.814 --> 31:40.679
Good. No Comms.

31:40.775 --> 31:43.266
There should be no signals
that link back to us.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.316
Holt:
I will inform the President.

31:45.404 --> 31:49.488
Now, I am getting major flak
from the Hill about John's
global initiatives.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.361
He's gotta bend a little.

31:51.452 --> 31:53.158
I don't think he will.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.361
Make him. It's yourjob.

31:55.456 --> 31:57.538
The Joint Chiefs are
up in arms.

31:57.625 --> 32:02.415
They wanna classify the alien
technology as a national
security risk and impound it.

32:02.505 --> 32:04.245
John won't permit that.

32:04.340 --> 32:06.205
He'll take these ships
out of here first.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.791
Look, I know you share my
concerns about John's plans.

32:08.886 --> 32:12.424
All I'm asking for is a
little compromise.
Is that unreasonable?

32:20.272 --> 32:23.184
Chiana:
Crichton, this isn't a
very fun party.

32:23.275 --> 32:27.234
It's not supposed to be a party.
It's a photo op for VIPs.

32:27.321 --> 32:28.310
Smile.

32:28.405 --> 32:31.238
Can't we find a real
party somewhere?

32:31.325 --> 32:33.486
Could I have everybody's
attention?

32:33.577 --> 32:37.035
Well, here comes the
"My fellow Americans".

32:37.123 --> 32:43.210
I once told my son that he'd...
he'd get the chance to become
his own kind of hero.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.286
Well, he got it.

32:46.382 --> 32:48.794
And he made the most of it.

32:48.884 --> 32:53.753
I also taught him to stick
to his guns when he
thought he was right.

32:53.848 --> 32:56.840
So I can't fault him
when he does.

32:56.934 --> 33:06.104
I've heard it said that he
should accept ourjudgment over
his, because he owes us.

33:06.902 --> 33:09.814
I've even said it myself.

33:11.448 --> 33:14.611
But we're wrong.

33:14.702 --> 33:19.537
Look at the friends he
discovered. The miracles
he brought.

33:19.623 --> 33:25.243
Then ask yourself what he
owes us, as compared to
what we owe him.

33:27.047 --> 33:32.167
Now, John insists that we
share these wonders with
the rest of the world.

33:32.261 --> 33:36.425
But some people are afraid of
what'll happen if we do.

33:37.641 --> 33:40.758
John's afraid of what'll
happen if we don't.

33:40.853 --> 33:43.435
And I'll go with that.

33:43.522 --> 33:49.017
So, as IASA's Project Director
for Extraterrestrial Studies,

33:51.030 --> 34:00.371
I hereby invite all nations to
participate in the ongoing
Farscape mission.

34:10.883 --> 34:13.169
What made you change your mind?

34:13.260 --> 34:15.546
Because I believe in you.

34:15.638 --> 34:17.344
That means a lot.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.137
There's a few things we
should talk about.

34:19.225 --> 34:21.181
Son, it's Christmas Eve.

34:21.268 --> 34:24.385
Right. It'll keep.

34:36.325 --> 34:39.738
I know you're preparing for
a private dinner, so I
won't stay long.

34:39.828 --> 34:42.160
Is he... is John here yet?

34:42.248 --> 34:44.079
Um, no, not yet.

34:44.166 --> 34:48.330
I... I wanted to bring you back
the clothes you lent me.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.456
They didn't suit you, huh?

34:50.547 --> 34:51.957
Oh, no, it's not that.

34:52.049 --> 34:55.507
It's just I'm more
comfortable in these.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.256
It's what I am, I guess.

34:58.347 --> 35:02.716
And I brought the books as
well. I really appreciate it.
Everything.

35:03.310 --> 35:04.925
Are you leaving?

35:05.020 --> 35:06.976
Possibly.

35:07.064 --> 35:11.103
Well, you'll be here tomorrow
morning to open presents with
the rest of us, won't you?

35:11.527 --> 35:13.643
I may not.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.477
What's happened?

35:15.572 --> 35:17.108
Nothing bad.

35:17.199 --> 35:19.315
It's not bad. It's just that I
may be needed on Moya...

35:19.410 --> 35:20.946
( kitchen timer beeping )

35:21.036 --> 35:23.243
...on Moya for a while.

35:23.330 --> 35:25.321
It's all right.

35:27.001 --> 35:29.242
I'll be right back.

35:31.588 --> 35:33.044
So...

35:33.132 --> 35:35.293
are you as bored as lam?

35:35.384 --> 35:38.342
I'm sorry, Senator, she's, uh,
still learning our customs.

35:38.429 --> 35:39.965
Spank you very much.

35:40.055 --> 35:42.091
Maybe you can teach me.
-Okay, Chiana, let's leave.

35:42.182 --> 35:43.342
Come on.
-What's wrong with you guys?

35:43.434 --> 35:45.140
What, you all scared
of us still?
-Uh-uh.

35:45.227 --> 35:47.343
Don't you know that all
humans are bigots?

35:47.438 --> 35:49.303
They fight even amongst
their own species.

35:49.398 --> 35:51.138
Well, they do seem to fight a
lot amongst themselves.

35:51.233 --> 35:55.226
Hey, maybe... maybe that's
why they barely left
their own planet.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.186
( sniffing )

35:57.281 --> 35:58.396
What?

35:58.490 --> 36:00.947
Something smells bad.

36:01.035 --> 36:02.195
Well, it's not me.

36:02.286 --> 36:04.197
( chuckles )

36:06.248 --> 36:08.079
Frell.

36:11.962 --> 36:14.169
Since you escorted us all the
way to the living room,

36:14.256 --> 36:16.713
I insist that you stay
for a cup of eggnog.
-Thank you, sir.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.415
Hi, Aeryn.
-He|lo.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.296
Jack:
Livvy?

36:20.387 --> 36:21.718
Olivia:
In here.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.510
I'm sorry, I just had to drop
some things off to Olivia.

36:25.601 --> 36:27.307
No, it's all right.

36:27.394 --> 36:30.136
(talking in background)

36:30.230 --> 36:33.313
Do you want me to go
back to Moya?

36:33.400 --> 36:36.483
We've already talked about
this. It's entirely up to you.

36:36.570 --> 36:38.902
Fine. I'll go with
what you prefer.

36:40.616 --> 36:41.776
Look,

36:41.867 --> 36:46.327
I'm not trying to
pressure you, John.

36:46.413 --> 36:49.871
I'm actually trying to take
the pressure off.

36:49.958 --> 36:54.873
Would you be happier if I
wasn't here on Earth?

36:54.963 --> 36:58.455
You don't have to justify it
or explain it.

36:58.550 --> 37:03.260
Just give me an honest
yes or no.

37:03.347 --> 37:04.837
Jack:
Aeryn?

37:04.932 --> 37:06.547
Would you join us for dinner?

37:06.642 --> 37:08.974
Oh, no, I couldn't impose.

37:09.061 --> 37:10.722
There's always room
for one more.

37:10.813 --> 37:12.349
It's a traditional family thing.

37:12.439 --> 37:14.225
We'll start a new tradition.

37:14.316 --> 37:16.523
Look, it's up to you, but
we'd love to have you.

37:16.610 --> 37:18.316
Could I get some eggnog, please?

37:18.404 --> 37:19.519
Mm-hmm.

37:31.417 --> 37:34.500
( screams )

37:34.586 --> 37:36.247
( groans )

37:36.338 --> 37:37.544
Livvy!

37:39.967 --> 37:43.050
( gunshots )

37:43.137 --> 37:45.093
( growls )

37:49.059 --> 37:50.560
(yells)

38:12.791 --> 38:13.576
(gasps )

38:13.667 --> 38:14.201
Whoa!

38:14.293 --> 38:15.658
(sighs)

38:16.336 --> 38:18.201
(growling)

38:20.048 --> 38:22.004
Suck on this.
-What is that?

38:22.092 --> 38:23.628
Oh, forget about it.

38:27.806 --> 38:28.761
Get Winona.

38:28.849 --> 38:30.055
Right.

38:34.938 --> 38:36.519
( growls )

38:41.236 --> 38:42.897
I... I've got Crichton.

38:42.988 --> 38:43.647
Yes?

38:43.739 --> 38:45.195
( screeches )

39:12.309 --> 39:14.015
( screeching )

39:16.522 --> 39:18.228
( Crichton yells )

39:19.233 --> 39:22.396
(Crichton coughing )

39:23.737 --> 39:25.273
( screeches )

39:25.364 --> 39:27.355
John, clear!

39:33.705 --> 39:35.286
( screams )

39:35.374 --> 39:37.911
(gasping)

39:43.090 --> 39:45.627
(gasping weakly)

39:56.019 --> 39:58.226
Dad! Livvy!

40:00.232 --> 40:01.347
Olivia?

40:01.441 --> 40:03.227
You all right, old man?

40:03.318 --> 40:05.274
Yeah.
-O|ivia, you all right?

40:05.362 --> 40:06.898
What the hell was that?

40:06.989 --> 40:07.694
No idea.

40:07.781 --> 40:10.147
(loud rumbling)

40:18.208 --> 40:20.119
( screaming )

40:20.210 --> 40:21.245
Get down!

40:28.844 --> 40:31.756
What is it?
Tell me what's wrong.

40:39.813 --> 40:42.304
( soft moans )

40:43.400 --> 40:45.186
Well.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.609
Merry frelling Christmas.

40:48.322 --> 40:49.732
Amen.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.411
Ma'am!

41:01.501 --> 41:05.039
Captain, that was
the best ever.

41:05.130 --> 41:08.167
You continue to amaze me.

41:08.258 --> 41:11.341
I'm glad I could be of service.

41:11.428 --> 41:13.840
I mean, I'm pleased I could
satisfy you.

41:16.475 --> 41:18.136
Will that be all?

41:18.226 --> 41:21.013
Yes. For now.

41:29.321 --> 41:31.232
(sighs)

41:44.336 --> 41:46.452
Uh, all the food goes
to my chamber.

41:46.546 --> 41:48.207
Well what are we doing with
Crichton's gifts?

41:48.298 --> 41:49.799
You wanna put 'em in
his quarters?

41:49.883 --> 41:52.124
Not the right time.
Cargo Bay for now.

41:52.219 --> 41:54.676
We'll leave as soon as
Crichton's aboard.
Here, I'll give you a hand.

41:54.763 --> 41:56.048
Thank you.

41:56.139 --> 41:59.677
Noranti. What's this?

42:01.353 --> 42:03.309
Well, I think you made it.

42:03.397 --> 42:05.058
It's for Crichton.

42:05.148 --> 42:07.104
What does it do?

42:08.276 --> 42:10.187
What does it do?

42:11.822 --> 42:13.813
It's to help him move on.

42:13.907 --> 42:16.649
Surmount his feelings
and forget.

42:17.285 --> 42:18.866
Who?

42:34.344 --> 42:37.336
Olivia:
I was gonna give you this
on Christmas.

42:44.271 --> 42:46.307
This is Mom's.

42:51.069 --> 42:53.526
She left this to you.

42:55.115 --> 42:57.322
I want you to have it.

42:57.951 --> 43:00.613
Mom'd love that.

43:00.704 --> 43:03.366
(jet flying overhead )

43:06.251 --> 43:07.957
Don't go.

43:08.336 --> 43:10.588
I have to go.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.801
You take care.

43:28.190 --> 43:30.021
(sniffling)

43:34.946 --> 43:36.322
Stay.

43:37.741 --> 43:39.231
Look, we'll guard the wormhole.

43:39.326 --> 43:42.659
We'll... we'll set up a defense
shield. Nothing'll get through.

43:42.746 --> 43:46.204
No, l have a job to do.

43:46.291 --> 43:49.124
That's your words again.

43:49.211 --> 43:52.123
(voice breaking ):
I don't wanna lose you, son.

43:53.840 --> 43:57.082
I can't shake this feeling that
you're not coming back.

43:57.177 --> 43:59.213
Oh, I'll be back.

44:01.139 --> 44:02.925
That's a promise.

44:05.894 --> 44:08.180
You take care of my home.

44:09.606 --> 44:11.471
That's a promise.

44:29.251 --> 44:31.537
Jack:
Take care of yourself.
