Hi, kids.

00:03.962 --> 00:05.088
Mommy, look what I made.

00:05.214 --> 00:06.964
Oh, wow.

00:07.591 --> 00:11.969
It's a farmer and a cow
and some horses.

00:12.304 --> 00:13.471
It's beautiful.

00:13.597 --> 00:14.889
It's for Ted's office.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.892
Oh, he's gonna love it.
And it'd be nice
if you called him Dad.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.519
Give me a big hug.

00:20.396 --> 00:24.774
Secret is the Haas avocados.
I can e-mail you the recipe
if you want.

they've changed plans
since Friday.

These idiots think you can
just add a 14th floor
and the mayor won't notice.

00:36.412 --> 00:39.372
And I thought turning
the garage into a nursery
was complicated.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.873
Any luck on your end yet?

00:40.999 --> 00:43.000
Not for lack of trying.

Come on, Margo!

00:49.591 --> 00:52.051
I have to go tell a client
he's an idiot.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.469
Go kick some ass.

00:53.595 --> 00:58.266
I have to take Stella to
karate by 3:00 and a birthday
party at Julia's after.

01:04.606 --> 01:05.940
You okay?

01:08.736 --> 01:11.028
Yeah. I'll be back.
Just make sure she's dressed.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.870
- Something's happened.
- I'm on it.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.001
Good morning, Jimmy.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.462
Anybody die
while I was gone?

02:52.130 --> 02:54.507
Did you iron your shirt?

02:54.716 --> 02:57.718
I thought about shaving.
Couldn't find a razor.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.554
What the hell happened
in Baltimore?

02:59.680 --> 03:02.139
Sorry, chief.
Never kiss and tell.

03:02.266 --> 03:03.391
I think you just did.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.144
There's no such thing
as "just a kiss".

03:08.105 --> 03:11.148
Did you iron your shirt?
Everybody's flash today.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.693
Has she left Mark?
Is she going to?

03:13.944 --> 03:16.571
I think I can hear
cancer kids calling.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.948
Are you planning on asking her
to leave Mark?

03:19.074 --> 03:21.284
Not sure.
Cameron keeps my calendar.

03:21.410 --> 03:24.161
Hey. This is a big deal.
This is an affair.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.164
Have you even talked to Stacy
about what the hell
this means?

03:27.541 --> 03:30.167
Didn't have a lot of time for talking,
if you know what I mean.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.170
Great. Breaking up a marriage.
Fertile ground
for high comedy.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.381
We need to talk about this.

03:36.258 --> 03:40.094
Gosh, wish I could. How did
the HIV test go? You study up?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.471
I rescheduled for this afternoon.
We have a new patient.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.974
Thirty-four-year-old female,
movement disorder.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.226
Movement disorder?
Fascinating.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.607
This isn't just gonna go away.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.650
No. But maybe you will.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.362
Probably suffered head trauma
in the car accident.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.947
Trauma leads
to the dyskinesia.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.115
According to her husband,

04:01.241 --> 04:03.743
the flailing started
before she got anywhere near that car.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.161
HOUSE: What does
the flailing look like?

04:05.287 --> 04:07.914
Her arms spasm uncontrollably
and there's a mild facial twitch.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.373
Demonstration?

04:09.750 --> 04:12.209
You wanna know
what it looks like,
go see the patient.

04:12.336 --> 04:16.172
Oh, snarky. Was he like this
the whole time I was gone?

04:16.298 --> 04:19.425
The patient's been on a fertility
regimen for the last 13 months.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.469
Excess estrogen
in the system could explain...

04:21.595 --> 04:23.220
Who finished
the animal crackers?

04:23.347 --> 04:25.598
Sudden movement disorder
could be a symptom
of Huntington's.

04:25.724 --> 04:30.353
If you finish something,
don't just put back
the empty box, throw it out.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.481
Huntington's
takes a day to confirm.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.734
We should put her on tamoxifen
in case it is
the fertility meds,

04:36.860 --> 04:38.069
counteract the estrogen.

04:38.195 --> 04:41.238
That's a great idea
if you wanna kill her baby.

04:42.324 --> 04:45.618
Movement disorder can present
in the first trimester.

04:45.744 --> 04:46.827
She's not pregnant.

04:46.954 --> 04:50.748
Peeing on a stick is only 99% accurate.
Get a real pregnancy test.

and the rabbit.

Cuddy just put me here
to make you miserable.

05:06.348 --> 05:09.266
Another two days,
you can go back
to making yourself miserable.

05:09.393 --> 05:13.813
Okay, get an MRI.
See if it's in her head
or in her uterus.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.191
You're gonna want
to paralyze her.

05:18.986 --> 05:22.655
You run tests on a flailer,
somebody's gonna lose an eye.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.824
(GASPING)

05:24.950 --> 05:27.284
Sorry. You think I'm pregnant?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.036
We need to find out for sure.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.288
Would all this go away
once she delivered?

05:31.415 --> 05:33.791
It could also be neurological.
We need to get an MRI.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.418
Can she do that
if she's pregnant?

05:35.544 --> 05:37.378
The risk to the fetus
is extremely low.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.963
But there is a risk.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.967
I don't think we should do it
until we're sure.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.221
Ted, I think
you should take Stella home.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.348
I wanna stay here.
We should be with you.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.599
You should take her
out of the room.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.977
We're gonna temporarily stop
Margo's spasms.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.687
- You can do that?
- Vecuronium.

05:54.813 --> 05:58.858
It's a paralytic.
Essentially cuts off the brain
from the muscles.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.404
Don't worry.
Your mom will be just fine.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.905
It'll make
running the tests easier,

06:05.032 --> 06:07.283
and it won't be
dangerous for the baby
if you are pregnant.

06:07.409 --> 06:08.492

06:08.618 --> 06:09.910

We'll be just outside, okay?
We gotta let the doctors
get her better.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.874
- All right?
- It's okay, sweetie.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.917
- Love you.
- Love you.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.966
Your vitals
will be watched closely.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.476
I'm gonna close your lids
so your eyes don't dry out.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.104
Just try to relax.

06:41.276 --> 06:44.945
What the hell did you do?
Were you just cold and lonely?

06:46.198 --> 06:48.365
Of course he told you.
He's an eight-year-old boy.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.284
Hey, you're the one
who kissed him.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.203
Why are you so worked up
over this?

06:52.329 --> 06:54.705
- Because you're married.
- Not to you.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.332
This is none of your business.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.460
The last time you left,
I was the one stuck
picking up the pieces.

06:59.586 --> 07:03.005
Oh, right. He cried
himself to sleep every night.
That so sounds like him.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.633
He's been pining
for five years.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.884
You're being dramatic.

07:07.010 --> 07:11.097
No. Actually,
I'm underplaying.
This is me being restrained.

07:11.223 --> 07:14.391
- It was one kiss.
- Are you being intentionally thick?

07:19.272 --> 07:22.608
This was not
just a one-night stand.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.986
You can't toy with him.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.071
I'm not.

07:31.118 --> 07:35.788
He's probably toying with me.
I don't know what I'm doing.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.752
Oh, boy.

07:48.260 --> 07:51.470
Welcome back to the world.
You're off the vecuronium.

07:52.013 --> 07:54.306
Could you wiggle your toes
for me?

07:56.059 --> 08:00.354
The MRI was clear.
Whatever this is,
isn't in your brain.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.732
MRI. So I'm not pregnant?

08:04.943 --> 08:06.360
CAMERON: I'm sorry.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.736
So what do we do next?

08:07.863 --> 08:12.366
Well, it could be a variety
of things, some treatable,
others more serious.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.534
Open up.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.120
I'm gonna run a genetic test
for Huntington's.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.414
- That one of the more serious ones?
- Yeah.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.834
It's also possible
that this is just a symptom
of the fertility treatments.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.545
And now that we know you're
not pregnant, we're gonna
start you on tamoxifen

08:24.671 --> 08:26.130
to counteract the estrogen.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.632
Will that undo
all the fertility treatments?

08:28.758 --> 08:31.552
For the time being, yeah.
But it could cure you.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.930
You can start trying again
once we get you healthy.

08:36.766 --> 08:37.933
Damn it!

08:38.059 --> 08:41.770
The spasms are gonna get worse
now that the vecuronium
is wearing off.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.441
What are you so scared of?

08:45.567 --> 08:48.402
I'm still your mother.
I'm just a little sick.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.531
Why did you even
bring her here? I told you
to leave her at home.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.496
FOREMAN: Hypervigilance,
sudden irritability.

08:59.623 --> 09:02.374
Symptomatic
of lunch with Cuddy?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.418
The patient
now defines Huntington's.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.588
Then what do you need me for?
Start her
on Huntington's meds.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.340
Before we get
her test results back?

09:09.466 --> 09:11.967
We start her on valproic acid,
it could destroy her liver.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.385
- Could stroke.
- If we wait,

09:13.511 --> 09:15.429
she could progress
to full-blown psychosis,

09:15.555 --> 09:18.265
and then her kid
will never get the chance
to say goodbye.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.351
Wanna tell the class
how that feels?

09:22.145 --> 09:25.189
Huntington's patients
don't progress to psychosis
in a day.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.316
(PAGER BEEPING)

than Huntington's.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.994

- She's having a psychotic break.

No.

CHASE: Push two milligrams
of Ativan.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.339
I want my daughter!

I want my daughter!
No more experiments!

CAMERON: How can
her Huntington's test
be negative?

10:06.606 --> 10:09.608
FOREMAN: All the signs
are there. Movement disorder,
psychosis.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.151
It should be Huntington's.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.238
Yeah.
It would certainly
make your job easier.

10:14.572 --> 10:18.617
Well, good news for Margo,
it's not Huntington's.
Bad news for us,

10:18.827 --> 10:22.204
her psychotic break
eliminates fertility meds.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.581
Which means we have no idea
what's wrong with her.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.209
We give you so much,
and you give us so little.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.546
You know, the patient
is prime age to develop
spontaneous schizophrenia.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.674
Almost impossible.
No family history
of mental illness.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.551
How about toxins?

10:36.136 --> 10:39.555
None of her family members
are sick. Nobody at her
office, her volunteer group,

10:39.681 --> 10:41.849
kid's classes,
and PTA members, all fine.

10:41.975 --> 10:47.396
So she raises a daughter,
runs a business,
she does charity work,

10:48.398 --> 10:51.358
she volunteers at school,
attends PTA.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.402
What makes Mommy run?

10:53.528 --> 10:55.404
- You're thinking drugs?
- Cocaine.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.615
Explains the psychosis
and the flailing.

10:58.950 --> 11:02.619
And the uncanny ability
to bring home the bacon,
fry it up in a pan,

11:02.746 --> 11:05.456
and never ever let Teddy
forget that he's a man.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.042
- I'll go look for her stash.
- Take Foreman.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.421
There's gotta be a reason
for the stereotype.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.433
I know you're in there.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.393
I can hear you caring.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.200
The door was locked.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.660
It means
I didn't wanna see anyone.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.125
High school reunion?

11:50.502 --> 11:52.920
It's for a patient.
She can't roll.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.172
Hey, I locked that door, too.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.008
Paranoia.
Must be the good stuff.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.637
Times like these,
I wish I had cancer.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.597
So what did she say?

12:04.432 --> 12:06.600
It depends. What did you do,
and who are we talking about?

12:06.726 --> 12:09.186
We both know
that as soon as we talked,
you ran to Stacy

12:09.312 --> 12:10.521
so you could gossip
and giggle.

12:10.647 --> 12:11.980
I need to know what she said.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.691
I have a crazy idea.
Why don't you go talk to her?

12:14.818 --> 12:17.736
Because my bestest buddy
says that could
lead to trouble.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.912
She sounds confused,
but I don't think she is.

12:27.622 --> 12:32.042
I think she's waiting for you
to do something,
show her you're serious.

12:32.710 --> 12:33.544
Wow.

12:34.045 --> 12:37.923
It's a big jump from
"infidelity is morally wrong"
to "do her".

12:38.049 --> 12:40.592
I didn't say "do her".
I said do something.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.678
What exactly did she say?

12:42.804 --> 12:45.139
She didn't say
it was a mistake.

12:46.766 --> 12:50.310
She's not gonna leave Mark
in the middle of his rehab.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.854
Too much guilt.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.564
She left you.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.734
Harsh toke, dude.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.032
House.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.000
Killjoy.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.928
I could've covered this.
You need to get
that test today.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.681
I wish you guys would remember
my birthday
instead of my HIV test.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.477
Forgive us
for being concerned.
I got a bet with House.

13:31.728 --> 13:35.606
He says
you're too scared to get it.
I say you're too anal not to.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.692
I'll cut you in.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.696
CAMERON: That was
a colossal waste.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.780
FOREMAN: Who would've known?

13:43.907 --> 13:48.619
Searching a high-end family
home for illicit narcotics
was such an obvious choice.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.580
Working moms practically
live in their cars.

13:51.956 --> 13:55.501
- Little bump on the run.
- You were a car thief, right?

14:04.552 --> 14:06.386
Mama's little helper.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.597
House, Ritalin.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.101
Cocaine with a PG rating.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.728
Prescribed to her daughter.

14:14.854 --> 14:18.690
Mommy does everything
for her family these days,
even swallows their pills.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.193
It's possible the kid's meds
are the kid's meds.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.278
Pop enough Ritalin,
it can explain everything.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.781
Well, Ritalin maybe explains
some tics, some involuntary...

14:25.907 --> 14:28.325
No, case reports
have referred to chorea.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.786
She's been cut off
from her stash,
so the flailing's tapered off,

14:30.912 --> 14:32.913
the psychosis hasn't returned.
It's perfect.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.748
Tox screen will confirm that.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.459
Half-life's 12 hours.
Drugs will be
out of her system.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.545
- We're done. Get rid of her.
- We're not done.

14:39.671 --> 14:43.632
We have to confirm the
diagnosis before we send her
home to die of something else.

14:43.758 --> 14:48.470
Oh, yes.
The power tastes so sweet.
You just can't resist.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.472
You're like a diabetic
at the ice cream counter.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.350
You wanna say no,
but you need
that chocolaty goodness.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.727
Yeah, well,
I'm still signing the charts.

14:55.853 --> 14:59.273
So until tomorrow,
you're not allowed
to kill anyone.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.732
Wuss.

15:01.192 --> 15:04.027
We've asked her three times
if she's on any meds.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.821
So we don't ask her.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.832
Candy striper.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.130
So, you like dogs?

15:26.634 --> 15:28.885
(WHISTLING)

15:37.895 --> 15:39.688
That's not a dog.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.773
Smart kid.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.067
Are you always
such a good little girl,

15:44.193 --> 15:47.029
or does Mommy sometimes say
you're the reason
she needs a double martini?

15:47.155 --> 15:47.988
Who are you?

15:48.114 --> 15:50.907
Over here, kiddo.
I'm talking to you. Focus.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.328
Must be because
you're off your meds.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.621
Who are you?

15:55.747 --> 15:58.498
- Doctor and candy striper.
- She's not on any medication.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.791
HOUSE: Well, that's strange.

15:59.917 --> 16:03.795
'Cause this bottle has her
name on it. And I think these
are medical pills inside.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.839
What's he talking about?

16:07.425 --> 16:10.218
The doctor
prescribed Stella...

16:10.678 --> 16:11.511
A few months ago.

16:11.638 --> 16:15.098
I never told you about it,
because I never gave her any.

16:15.767 --> 16:18.894
That's funny,
'cause the bottle's
almost empty.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.563
You missed a couple of days.
Take five.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.483
- Stop.
- Why? Unless they're not hers.

16:24.901 --> 16:25.942
You need some water, sweetie?

16:26.069 --> 16:27.569
I'm not taking Ritalin.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.489
Come on. All the cool moms
are doing it.

16:30.615 --> 16:33.909
And tox screen
says you're cool, too.

16:36.537 --> 16:39.915
You were on drugs
while taking care of Stella?

16:46.464 --> 16:47.923
I'm sorry, Ted.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.807
It's a cafeteria menu.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.934
It should take a couple hours
to process her.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.895
Then you can take her home
and divorce her.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.787
Working late?

17:19.288 --> 17:20.706
Or are you just avoiding Mark?

17:20.832 --> 17:22.582
It was one kiss, Greg.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.669
So far. I'm planning
on keeping a chart.

17:25.795 --> 17:29.047
I'm moving back
to Short Hills.
I think it's time.

17:29.716 --> 17:30.924
You're leaving?

17:31.050 --> 17:34.177
It was never meant to be
permanent, and now
that Mark's getting better...

17:34.303 --> 17:36.054
Yeah, much better.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.223
Except for the whole
walking thing.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.559
He needs to get back to work.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.602
Right.

17:43.104 --> 17:47.357
Saving the next generation
from making bad choices
about acne cream.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.737
You're running away
because the kiss
meant something.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.406
I'm not running away.
I'm going home.

17:54.532 --> 17:55.657
With Mark.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.535
I love Mark.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.079
You love me more.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.712
I don't want you to leave.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.480
Are we okay?

18:27.732 --> 18:28.982
I'm sorry.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.776
Let's just get you home.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.611
That's a good idea.

18:42.497 --> 18:43.830
- Mommy!
- Hey!

18:43.956 --> 18:45.624
- Call a code!
- What's wrong, Mommy?

- No, I don't.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.887
- Margo's stable, but...
- Oh, my God.

18:59.013 --> 19:02.432
- Well, I'll be right there.
- She had a stroke.

Perfect.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.692
Gotta go back to work.

Right now?

19:15.780 --> 19:16.822
Well...

19:18.157 --> 19:21.576
Patient's stable.
Could maybe wait a half-hour.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.754
He should have been here
20 minutes ago.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.674
Doubt if he makes it at all.
I saw him leave with Stacy.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.300
He was probably
just walking her to her car.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.427
Oh, yeah.
That sounds like House.

19:39.554 --> 19:42.222
He's not an idiot.
He's not gonna hook up
with a married woman.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.100
I hope he is getting some.
Maybe he'll mellow out.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.602
(HOUSE SINGING)

19:52.191 --> 19:56.862
- What took you so long? It's midnight.
- Traffic. Cinco de Mayo.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.947
You owe me $100.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.783
You didn't take the test?

20:01.909 --> 20:04.035
Fear trumps anal every time.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.455
It's not a big deal.
I had the viral load
and antibody test.

20:07.582 --> 20:10.166
It's 99.9%
that I don't have HIV.

20:10.293 --> 20:13.753
And if you have the test,
and it's negative,
you gain a tenth of a point.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.132
But if it's positive you lose
nearly 100, right?

20:17.800 --> 20:21.511
No arrhythmia,
so Ritalin
isn't the big problem.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.054
Something else is going on.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.682
Fine, let's play doctors.

20:25.808 --> 20:27.767
I removed the clot
which caused the stroke.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.185
Problem is,
we don't know
where it came from.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.771
Did ultrasounds of her heart,
arms and legs. All clear.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.565
Could be
a protein C deficiency.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.609
Wouldn't explain
the movement disorder.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.861
Nothing explains everything.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.989
What if
it's a crime syndicate?

20:41.115 --> 20:44.910
Let's say Ritalin
and the fertility meds
plotted a caper.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.913
Ritalin takes care
of the psychosis,
the flailing.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.289
I still don't think Ritalin...

20:49.415 --> 20:51.791
HOUSE: Fertility meds
are competitive by nature.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.961
They had to do
something bigger,
something really unexpected.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.839
Fertility treatments
have been known
to cause endometrial cancer.

20:57.965 --> 21:01.051
Which could cause clots,
which could have caused her
to stroke.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.136
So ultrasound her uterus
this time.

21:03.262 --> 21:07.807

growing in there that doesn't
look adorable in a onesie.

Still fits.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.393

did the hurting part.

- He just doesn't know it yet.
- If I never tell him, it'll never hurt.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.059
I want not to love Mark.
I wanna hate you.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.229

to be simple,
but it's not.

have a life with me,

22:44.196 --> 22:46.656

She had a blood clot

if we don't find that tumor.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.780
Do an endometrial biopsy.

23:26.906 --> 23:30.742

26:05.022 --> 26:06.147
(MOANING)

26:08.359 --> 26:09.943
I need some advice.

26:10.069 --> 26:13.446
- Whatever it is, can it wait?
- Yeah.

26:16.659 --> 26:18.868
What was Greg like
after I left?

26:19.870 --> 26:23.039
An egomaniacal
narcissistic pain in the ass.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.749
Same as before you left.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.960
Do you think he's capable
of having a real relationship?

26:27.086 --> 26:29.379
- What happened in Baltimore?
- Nothing.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.005
- Right.
- Maybe something.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.298
Right.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.301
Technically,
most of the something
happened after Baltimore.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.387
Oh, God, Stacy.

26:37.972 --> 26:39.305
I don't know what to do.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.933
Are you seriously thinking
about leaving Mark?

26:42.059 --> 26:43.935
No. I don't know.

26:44.645 --> 26:45.770
I can't.

26:45.896 --> 26:48.398
And you want me
to tell you it's okay?

26:48.565 --> 26:51.234
It wasn't all bad with Greg.
I was with him for a reason.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.902
You left him for a reason.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.613
I could swear
I remember him being fun.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.452
Sorry for the scare.

27:01.578 --> 27:02.996
Just tell me she's okay.

27:03.122 --> 27:06.791
Ultrasound showed the bleed
was coming from her liver.

27:06.917 --> 27:09.544
It's rare, but the blood
got into her fallopian tubes.

27:09.670 --> 27:13.131
In a way, it was lucky.
Let us know we were looking
in the wrong place.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.674
The tumor's in her liver.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.426
Is it cancer?

27:16.885 --> 27:19.012
We're running some more tests.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.157
There it is.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.535
It's a liver tumor.

27:43.912 --> 27:48.875
Well, if it's malignant, at
least she's only gonna leave
one child without a mother.

27:49.752 --> 27:50.918
Do a biopsy.

27:51.045 --> 27:53.046
We can't. It's vascular.

27:53.714 --> 27:54.714
MARK: House.

28:02.139 --> 28:04.474
- What?
- I'm here about Stacy.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.976
What about her?

28:07.936 --> 28:10.229
I think I'm losing her.

28:10.981 --> 28:12.982
Your wife, your problem.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.817
She won't talk to me.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.612
So what?
You gonna talk to me instead?
Talk to your shrink.

28:17.738 --> 28:18.946
She keeps saying
everything's fine.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.823
Find a bar.
Talk to a stranger.

28:20.949 --> 28:23.826
You're the only one
who's been through this.

28:26.789 --> 28:28.456
I'm shutting her out.

28:28.582 --> 28:31.876
I'm saying things
and then hating myself
for saying them.

28:32.628 --> 28:35.046
- How did you get past that?
- Didn't.

28:35.881 --> 28:39.675
Can you please be
a human being for one minute
and talk to me?

28:46.016 --> 28:48.893
Sorry. Gotta go. People dying.

28:50.312 --> 28:52.438
You're not gonna outrun me.

28:56.860 --> 28:57.819
House!

29:05.452 --> 29:07.537
You're not ready for this.

29:11.834 --> 29:15.211
I've seen the way
you and Stacy
talk to each other.

29:17.131 --> 29:18.589
You're an idiot.

29:18.715 --> 29:21.008
You probably
just set your rehab
back three months.

29:21.135 --> 29:23.261
Let go. Get off of me!

29:38.068 --> 29:40.445
Liver tumor
doesn't make sense.

29:40.863 --> 29:42.864
You saying the CT was wrong?

29:42.990 --> 29:47.535
I'm saying the symptoms
don't add up. A plus B
does not equal liver tumor.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.787
We gotta solve for X.

29:51.331 --> 29:53.916
We gotta look at this
differently.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.461
What do we know about her?

29:56.587 --> 29:58.713
The side effects
of the Ritalin caused the...

29:58.839 --> 30:02.467
No. We've examined the file
up and down.
Come on, give me that.

30:02.676 --> 30:05.803
Why do you people
always overlook
the human element?

30:05.929 --> 30:09.015
What do we know about her?
Margo...

30:11.643 --> 30:13.519
Dalton. The woman.

30:14.229 --> 30:17.064
She's a people-pleaser.
She doesn't like
to let people down.

30:17.191 --> 30:18.733
Never fights with her husband.

30:18.859 --> 30:22.069
She turned to drugs
instead of asking for help
to manage her life.

30:22.196 --> 30:24.280
So if she can't manage now,

30:25.407 --> 30:27.742
why does she want another kid?

30:33.540 --> 30:36.083
Foreman,
I need your help here.

30:36.210 --> 30:39.212
You wanna pull a bank job,
would you go it alone?

30:39.338 --> 30:41.923
If you gonna rob a home, sure,
that's a one or two man crew.

30:42.049 --> 30:45.510
But a bank,
you need a lookout,
a getaway driver.

30:46.094 --> 30:49.472
I'm not saying anything
until the metaphor
plays itself out.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.390
So here's the caper.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.560
Fertility meds
create a distraction.

30:54.937 --> 30:57.855
Mommy had three refills
on Ritalin
in the last three weeks.

30:57.981 --> 31:00.066
That team goes straight
for the top floor.

31:00.192 --> 31:04.779
No trouble taking out
communications, but they need
the specialist, a safecracker.

31:04.905 --> 31:08.574
All he does is stroke,
blood clot, liver tumor.

31:09.535 --> 31:13.287
Foreman was right.
This badass
even does flailing.

31:14.748 --> 31:15.915
Come on.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.793
There's only one guy I know
who does that kind of work.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.628
Birth control pills?

31:30.055 --> 31:32.848
While the surgeons
are cutting out
a chunk of your liver,

31:32.975 --> 31:34.725
should I have them do
a hysterectomy, too?

31:34.851 --> 31:36.477
A hysterectomy?

31:36.687 --> 31:38.479
I'm trying to get pregnant.

31:38.605 --> 31:41.649
You don't have to lie to me.
We're not married.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.109
You're Supermom.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.402
You can do anything.

31:44.528 --> 31:48.114
You work seven days a week,
you volunteer,
you raise a kid.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.784
Yet you still
somehow find the time
to lie to hubby number two

31:51.910 --> 31:55.913
that you really, really wanna
give him a child with his chin
and pretty brown eyes.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.582
What makes you think
that I would...

31:57.708 --> 31:58.791
Because it fits.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.545
Birth control pills caused
a hepatocellular adenoma.

32:03.088 --> 32:06.716
Explains all your symptoms
that aren't explained
by your other lies.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.345
That's it?

32:13.307 --> 32:14.557
Also...

32:15.142 --> 32:17.184
I'll have the tuna on rye.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.356
Would you like
to leave my room now?

32:23.650 --> 32:25.026
Your tumor is benign.

32:25.152 --> 32:27.987
Stop taking the pill,
and it will go away
on its own.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.363
I'm canceling the surgery.

32:29.489 --> 32:30.865
What are you
gonna tell my husband?

32:30.991 --> 32:33.034
That I'm canceling
the surgery.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.161
You can do the explaining.

32:36.246 --> 32:38.039
It's tricky, huh?

32:38.165 --> 32:39.874
It's one thing to say
you can't have a baby.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.418
It's another to say
you don't want one.

32:42.544 --> 32:45.046
Personally, I'd make up
some other lie.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.589
Could...

32:47.633 --> 32:49.675
Could I die on the table?

32:50.385 --> 32:53.095
Could you die
if you tell him the truth?

32:58.435 --> 33:00.144
I need this surgery.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.397
I'm not on the pill.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.610
You can't cancel the surgery.

33:07.736 --> 33:10.488
If she goes off the pill,
the tumor
goes away on its own.

33:10.614 --> 33:12.740
You have no proof
the birth control pills
caused this.

33:12.866 --> 33:14.075
You have no proof
she's even taking them.

33:14.201 --> 33:16.661
If we do the surgery
maybe we'll kill her
on the table.

33:16.787 --> 33:18.454
Then I can prove
I'm right at the autopsy.

33:18.580 --> 33:22.041
Or we can forget the surgery,
let the tumor grow,
and kill her.

33:22.167 --> 33:26.337
Why don't you take it up
with Stacy, see which option
minimizes your risk?

33:26.463 --> 33:29.382
Here's what I think
she's gonna say,
"Oh, I love Greg.

33:29.508 --> 33:32.259
But if you go against
the patient's wishes,
you're calling her a liar.

33:32.386 --> 33:34.595
And if something goes wrong,
I end up in court

33:34.721 --> 33:38.140
having to defend
the big mean doctor,
albeit with dreamy eyes,

33:38.266 --> 33:40.226
who wouldn't believe
the nice suburban mom.

33:40.352 --> 33:44.063
And even though
his cane makes me melt,
do the damn surgery."

34:16.680 --> 34:18.013
HOUSE: Shocking.

34:18.140 --> 34:19.390
It's benign.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.393
People do
crazy things for love.

34:22.519 --> 34:27.398
No, crazy is hanging out
in the park all day
talking to pigeons.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.817
Margo knows what she's doing.

34:29.943 --> 34:32.611
She gave up half her liver
to save her marriage.

34:32.738 --> 34:37.241
No, she surgically removed her
fingerprints
to cover her pathetic lie.

34:38.285 --> 34:41.954
It's twisted and manipulative.
I get that. But it's also

34:43.290 --> 34:44.498
romantic.

34:48.170 --> 34:51.547
I'm barely willing
to put the seat down
after I pee.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.090
Do we need to talk?

34:53.216 --> 34:54.675
Nope. I'm fine.

35:02.058 --> 35:04.769
So the surgeon
got the whole tumor,
and it was benign.

35:04.895 --> 35:05.936
That's good, right?

35:06.062 --> 35:07.104
Yeah, benign is good.

35:07.230 --> 35:10.483
How could a benign tumor
have caused all the symptoms?

35:14.070 --> 35:16.447
We believe
all your wife's symptoms
will go away now.

35:16.573 --> 35:18.949
Oh, thank God.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.243
Look,
I'm gonna pick up Stella.

35:24.498 --> 35:27.166
I'll call you
after I get the babysitter.

35:31.087 --> 35:32.505
Dr. Foreman,

35:33.089 --> 35:34.882
you can help me.

35:37.010 --> 35:39.220
You could tell my husband that

35:39.971 --> 35:41.806
because of all this,

35:43.350 --> 35:46.268
I can't take
any more fertility treatments.

35:50.398 --> 35:54.485
Confidentiality rules stop me
from telling your husband
the truth.

35:55.737 --> 35:58.155
But my obligation to lie
ends there.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.994
Are there...

36:05.372 --> 36:09.500
Is there a birth control
method, something
that won't make me sick?

36:10.252 --> 36:12.545
Margo,
you're gonna have risks
with everything,

36:12.671 --> 36:15.339
especially
if you're not telling
your fertility doctor.

36:15.465 --> 36:19.593
If you keep doing this,
it's gonna kill your marriage
and kill you.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.012
You don't know.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.349
In a few years,

36:26.560 --> 36:28.227
we'll give up.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.729
Stop trying to get pregnant.

36:31.273 --> 36:33.023
We'll hug, cry.

36:35.652 --> 36:40.489
Eventually Ted will stop
thinking about it, and he'll
appreciate Stella even more.

36:42.075 --> 36:46.078
And we'll live
happily together
for the next 50 years.

37:01.177 --> 37:04.096
Something you need to see.

37:11.146 --> 37:13.981
Knowing is always better
than not knowing.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.039
It's a referral request.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.123
Right.

37:31.708 --> 37:34.251
The HIV thing came in earlier.

37:34.711 --> 37:36.253
You're fine.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.965
You won't read your mail,
but you'll open mine?

37:40.091 --> 37:42.885
It said "confidential",
and I wanted to know.

37:43.428 --> 37:47.222
The most important letter
of my life,
and you're still an ass.

37:47.641 --> 37:49.391
Comforting, isn't it?

38:21.299 --> 38:22.716
(DOOR OPENING)

38:24.594 --> 38:25.678
Hey.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.137
Hi.

38:39.818 --> 38:43.821
I'm gonna talk to Mark
tonight, and I'm gonna
stay here with you.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.282
Don't do it.

38:48.410 --> 38:50.244
This isn't funny, Greg.

38:50.370 --> 38:51.578
I know.

38:56.751 --> 38:57.918
You

38:59.546 --> 39:01.964
spent all these months
chasing me.

39:02.090 --> 39:05.926
Now I'm here
and you start running?
What the hell changed?

39:06.511 --> 39:07.845
Nothing.

39:08.972 --> 39:10.723
Nothing changes.

39:11.766 --> 39:14.643
- I'm not gonna change.
- Who asked you to?

39:15.645 --> 39:18.355
Mark is willing to do
whatever it takes.

39:20.150 --> 39:21.233
I'm not.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.610
Never was.

39:24.195 --> 39:28.157
Now you're introspective?
Weren't so analytical
the other night.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.285
You were happy with Mark.
You'll be happy again.

39:31.411 --> 39:33.620
Shut up about Mark.
What the hell
is wrong with you?

39:33.747 --> 39:36.582
- I can't make you happy!
- What?

39:39.044 --> 39:41.712
How do you think
this is gonna end?

39:43.339 --> 39:46.967
We'll be happy, for what?
A few weeks? A few months?

39:49.095 --> 39:50.637
And then I'll...

39:50.764 --> 39:53.515
I'll say something insensitive
or I'll

39:53.933 --> 39:57.144
start ignoring you.
And at first it'll be okay.

39:57.270 --> 40:00.272
It's just House being House.
And then,

40:02.108 --> 40:05.152
at some point,
you will need something more.

40:05.278 --> 40:08.572
You'll need someone
who can give you
something I can't.

40:09.032 --> 40:12.159
You know I'm right.
I've been there before.

40:15.163 --> 40:16.163
Oh.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.127
It doesn't have to be.

40:23.338 --> 40:28.217
It does.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.556
I don't wanna go there again.

40:41.189 --> 40:42.731
I'm sorry, Stacy.

40:54.494 --> 40:55.702
(DOOR CLOSING)

41:00.041 --> 41:01.125
(SIGHS)

41:07.257 --> 41:10.050
$50 says they're
divorced in a year.

41:10.176 --> 41:11.385
Six months, tops.

41:11.511 --> 41:14.596
I'll take that bet.
It's the perfect marriage.

41:14.764 --> 41:18.642
There's nothing to fight over
if you never
talk about anything.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.675
What did you tell her?

41:54.345 --> 41:56.805
I told her
she's better off without me.

41:57.223 --> 41:59.266
That's probably true.

42:07.275 --> 42:08.817
You're an idiot.

42:10.153 --> 42:12.487
You don't think
she'd be better off
without you.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.073
Right.
I sent her off on a whim.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.076
You have no idea
why you sent her off!

42:18.203 --> 42:21.079
- Don't do this.
- This was no great sacrifice!

42:21.206 --> 42:23.457
You sent her away because
you've got to be miserable!

42:23.583 --> 42:27.002
This kind of psycho-crap
help get your patients
through the long nights?

42:27.128 --> 42:28.545
Or is it just for you?

42:28.671 --> 42:32.466
Tough love make you feel good?
Helping people
feel their pain?

42:37.847 --> 42:39.848
You don't like yourself.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.309
But you do admire yourself.

42:42.435 --> 42:44.603
It's all you've got,
so you cling to it.

42:44.729 --> 42:49.107
You're so afraid
if you change, you'll lose
what makes you special.

42:53.947 --> 42:57.950
Being miserable
doesn't make you better
than anybody else, House.

42:58.076 --> 43:00.160
It just makes you miserable.
