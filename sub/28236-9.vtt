00:05.095 --> 00:09.053
Previously
on Billions...

00:09.136 --> 00:10.261
The fuck
is this all about?

00:10.345 --> 00:13.512
Site's closed.
Security reasons.

00:13.595 --> 00:15.804
This is what
it's about, Dad.

00:15.887 --> 00:17.679
Head of the Board of
Elections is deciding

00:17.762 --> 00:19.512
whether to allow
blockchain technology-

00:19.595 --> 00:20.470
voting from
mobile phones.

00:20.553 --> 00:22.178
Chuck, welcome.

00:22.261 --> 00:24.804
I thought this was
to be our meeting-

00:24.887 --> 00:27.720
The DOJ has grave concerns
about mobile voting-

00:27.804 --> 00:29.595
Uh. You mean
Jock Jeffcoat does.

00:29.679 --> 00:31.637
Sanford Bensinger
is on the phone.

00:31.720 --> 00:32.929
Sandy.

00:33.011 --> 00:35.345
The NFL
is turning you down.

00:35.428 --> 00:38.804
Sports franchises are how we
knight people in this country.

00:38.887 --> 00:41.178
And you're not royalty.

00:41.261 --> 00:43.095
They were finally fed up
with your legal troubles-

00:43.178 --> 00:44.512
Thank you for
the firefighter prompt.

00:44.595 --> 00:47.095
I'm happy it was useful.

00:47.178 --> 00:48.261
I need you to track down

00:48.345 --> 00:49.345
some old session notes.

00:49.428 --> 00:52.220
All my files for Taylor Mason.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.512
You're not here to ask me to
speak at a conference, are you?

00:54.595 --> 00:56.804
There have been
accusations of malpractice.

00:56.887 --> 01:00.470
Dr. Rhoades, your medical
license is under review.

01:00.553 --> 01:03.095
dramatic music

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.095 --> 01:21.804
You can't
allow it to happen.

01:21.887 --> 01:24.261
You can't let them
strip me of my license.

01:24.345 --> 01:26.220
The Medical Board is not
under my jurisdiction.

01:26.303 --> 01:27.720
What you're asking-

01:27.804 --> 01:29.220
Is something you can do.

01:29.303 --> 01:31.053
Make them drop
the inquest?

01:31.136 --> 01:34.929
If I can pull it off,
it'll be nearly impossible.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.136
And if it goes sideways,
I'm-

01:36.220 --> 01:37.970
You wanted to know
what you could do

01:38.053 --> 01:39.428
to make things better
between us.

01:39.512 --> 01:40.762
This is it.

01:40.845 --> 01:42.929
So, I do this thing,

01:43.011 --> 01:45.261
and then what,
we're all the way back?

01:45.345 --> 01:46.720
Is that the promise?

01:46.804 --> 01:48.095
I can promise
you this:

01:48.178 --> 01:49.804
bargaining never
won a woman back.

01:49.887 --> 01:51.762
But selfless
acts have.

01:51.845 --> 01:55.303
I don't need Chuck
Rhoades the lawyer.

01:55.387 --> 01:58.053
Or the husband.
Or the power bottom.

01:58.136 --> 02:00.053
I need Chuck Rhoades
the killer.

02:00.136 --> 02:03.970
You've judged me
for being that,

02:04.053 --> 02:07.887
criticized me,
reviled me-

02:07.970 --> 02:10.804
but now, when it's
on your behalf-

02:10.887 --> 02:12.845
you're willing to
call upon it.

02:12.929 --> 02:15.261
To let it out.
Mm-hmm.

02:15.345 --> 02:17.470
Well, you have to want
the whole package, Wendy.

02:17.553 --> 02:18.804
As I do with you.

02:18.887 --> 02:20.178
Or what the devil
are we?

02:20.261 --> 02:21.720
Right now I don't-
I don't know what I am.

02:21.804 --> 02:24.845
I state that freely
and without pride.

02:24.929 --> 02:26.428
But you are a killer.

02:26.512 --> 02:29.053
You-You kill for
yourself all the time.

02:29.136 --> 02:30.845
So go kill for me.

02:30.929 --> 02:32.845
I'm giving you license
to use the part of yourself

02:32.929 --> 02:34.053
that makes you feel
most alive.

02:34.136 --> 02:37.387
Because it serves you.

02:37.470 --> 02:40.595
I've done wrong.

02:40.679 --> 02:45.220
Turned myself into that which
I swore I would never be.

02:45.303 --> 02:47.595
I had to.
And, uh...

02:47.679 --> 02:49.762
It worked.

02:49.845 --> 02:54.595
And yes, I-I learned something
about myself that is unpleasant.

02:54.679 --> 02:56.428
But now I need to
turn myself back into

02:56.512 --> 03:00.220
who I'm supposed to be-
if that's even possible.

03:00.303 --> 03:03.220
But I can't do that
if I'm not a doctor.

03:03.303 --> 03:08.011
So, help me, Chuck,
or I'm fucking lost.

03:10.470 --> 03:13.178
Don't fuck with the
State Medical Board, Chuck.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.470
You're still consolidating your
power. Extending your reach.

03:15.553 --> 03:18.428
If you try to manipulate
the board and fail-

03:18.512 --> 03:20.470
it'll be the one scandal
too many,

03:20.553 --> 03:23.345
and too early,
that ends your career.

03:23.428 --> 03:25.679
So, instead,
prepare a defense for Wendy.

03:25.762 --> 03:27.679
Let the hearing happen.
Win it.

03:27.762 --> 03:29.303
That's the smart approach.

03:29.387 --> 03:31.512
Well. This isn't about
the smart move.

03:31.595 --> 03:33.136
It's about what
my father would call:

03:33.220 --> 03:35.553
"The future of my dynasty."

03:35.637 --> 03:37.220
The marriage.

03:37.303 --> 03:39.095
I can't keep
shuffling along

03:39.178 --> 03:41.804
with muttered apologies
and half measures.

03:41.887 --> 03:43.178
I need to
change the paradigm.

03:43.261 --> 03:45.178
A big move.

03:45.261 --> 03:47.637
Get back to zero.

03:47.720 --> 03:50.553
If I know my man, you have
a big move at the ready.

03:50.637 --> 03:52.303
I know a former
State Board member

03:52.387 --> 03:54.136
who's acquainted
with every crevice

03:54.220 --> 03:56.387
and loophole of their
disciplinary procedures.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.679
Why didn't you
start there?

03:58.762 --> 04:01.387
Because
I put him in prison.

04:01.470 --> 04:03.679
Merle Haggard's
"Sing Me Back Home"

04:09.804 --> 04:14.011
The warden led a prisoner

04:14.095 --> 04:18.345
Down the hallway to his doom

04:18.428 --> 04:20.387
And I stood up

04:20.470 --> 04:24.595
To say goodbye
like all the rest

04:27.387 --> 04:31.303
And I heard him
tell the warden

04:31.387 --> 04:35.553
Just before
he reached my cell

04:35.637 --> 04:39.136
"Let my guitar-playing
friend"

04:39.220 --> 04:43.178
"Do my request"

04:43.261 --> 04:48.553
Let him sing me back home

04:48.637 --> 04:53.428
With a song I used to hear

04:53.512 --> 04:58.345
Sing me back home
before I die

05:00.136 --> 05:02.345
You'd think after
so much time in this place,

05:02.428 --> 05:04.053
I'd be happy
to see anyone.

05:04.136 --> 05:06.428
Oh. I don't fool myself that
I bring any measure of joy

05:06.512 --> 05:08.553
to most with whom
I daily interact.

05:08.637 --> 05:11.553
That's the prosecutor's curse.

05:11.637 --> 05:14.637
Like a dentist without
the laughing gas.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.387
Do know what we called dentists
in medical school?

05:17.470 --> 05:20.261
"Little brains."
Like in Defending Your Life.

05:20.345 --> 05:23.470
The lawyers, we called
"little hearts."

05:23.553 --> 05:26.553
Which I now know gave them
too much credit.

05:26.637 --> 05:28.011
Your compatriots in here

05:28.095 --> 05:29.595
must love the Albert Brooks
references.

05:29.679 --> 05:31.387
Oh. You'd be surprised.
I'm useful to them,

05:31.470 --> 05:33.679
tend to them
when they get ill,

05:33.762 --> 05:36.553
tell them how to get into the
infirmary and off work detail,

05:36.637 --> 05:38.553
teach 'em what to say to get
the drugs they want there.

05:38.637 --> 05:40.261
So they pretty much
follow along,

05:40.345 --> 05:42.970
or try to, no matter what
I'm talking about.

05:43.053 --> 05:46.095
Perhaps I can be
useful to you.

05:46.178 --> 05:47.470
That's why
I came here today.

05:47.553 --> 05:49.470
No. You came because
there must be

05:49.553 --> 05:51.512
some way you believe
I can be of use to you.

05:51.595 --> 05:54.679
And there's something you think
that I need in trade.

05:54.762 --> 05:57.220
But that didn't work out so well
for me last time.

05:57.303 --> 06:00.929
That's one way to see it.

06:01.011 --> 06:03.845
The other is that
the eleven million dollars did,

06:03.929 --> 06:06.303
as promised,
stay in your bank account.

06:06.387 --> 06:09.053
So that your wife and kids
are well taken care of.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.887
Well, that brought me more peace
before she divorced me.

06:11.970 --> 06:14.720
And when she was still
letting the kids visit me.

06:14.804 --> 06:18.470
Sorry to hear that.

06:18.553 --> 06:21.095
But I know that you don't
want my sympathy.

06:21.178 --> 06:24.387
Thankfully, I may be able to
offer you more than that-

06:24.470 --> 06:27.220
if you can offer
some cooperation.

06:33.595 --> 06:35.512
A close acquaintance-
a medical doctor-

06:35.595 --> 06:38.053
like you were
and perhaps might be again-

06:38.136 --> 06:41.512
is facing
disciplinary proceedings.

06:41.595 --> 06:45.428
She needs help shutting them
down before she has to appear.

06:47.136 --> 06:49.095
You want me to be
your Hannibal Lecter.

06:49.178 --> 06:51.762
I need pressure points
on committee members.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.929
So I can press 'em.

06:54.011 --> 06:57.762
Well. Like Dr. Lecter, I can put
practicality above vengeance.

06:57.845 --> 06:59.679
So, sure, Chuck,
we can negotiate.

06:59.762 --> 07:02.178
Get me out of here.
Get me free.

07:02.261 --> 07:04.095
So I can remind my children
of who I really am.

07:04.178 --> 07:05.720
And then I'll help.

07:05.804 --> 07:08.220
That I cannot do.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.637
I am no longer
US Attorney.

07:10.720 --> 07:14.679
But I do sit a powerful throne,
attended by powerful friends.

07:14.762 --> 07:19.512
So I will work, tirelessly,
to make it so, over time.

07:19.595 --> 07:22.929
Yeah. I don't see how
I can trust you on that.

07:23.011 --> 07:26.136
Again, I did let you keep
the eleven million.

07:26.220 --> 07:29.595
It was never mine.

07:29.679 --> 07:32.845
And I would gladly give it back
to be freed of all of this.

07:32.929 --> 07:36.762
So...

07:36.845 --> 07:39.887
No.

07:39.970 --> 07:42.470
If I'm your best bet,
it seems all you can do

07:42.553 --> 07:46.053
is go home
and make your wife miserable.

07:46.136 --> 07:49.303
As I have mine.

07:49.387 --> 07:51.261
Yeah.
Don't be surprised.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.053
There's at least one old
colleague on the outside

07:53.136 --> 07:55.387
I still correspond with.

07:55.470 --> 07:59.762
Positively
Lecter-like.

08:01.929 --> 08:07.553
dramatic music

08:07.637 --> 08:09.637
If I hear you call
anyone on the Board,

08:09.720 --> 08:12.220
try to make this
harder for her,

08:12.303 --> 08:15.637
your wife-ex-
whatever-

08:15.720 --> 08:18.720
will be prosecuted for
ill gotten gains

08:18.804 --> 08:21.178
on that eleven million

08:21.261 --> 08:25.970
and your kids will end up living
in a fucking housing project.

08:28.095 --> 08:33.428
Do we understand each other,
Clarice?

08:51.887 --> 08:53.428
Seen better days.

08:53.512 --> 08:55.720
It will again,
once I do my magic.

08:55.804 --> 08:58.970
First thing: "fire every one of
these cocksuckers."

08:59.053 --> 09:00.887
Hoffa.

09:00.970 --> 09:02.637
"You're gonna can
a lot of people,

09:02.720 --> 09:04.387
make sure you do it
on the first day.

09:04.470 --> 09:07.428
That way, the ones that are left
don't feel insecure, you see.

09:07.512 --> 09:10.261
What they feel
is grateful."

09:10.345 --> 09:13.053
That's a sad view
of how people tick.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.720
But true. So when we walk
into that boardroom-

09:15.804 --> 09:17.136
I can't fire them.

09:17.220 --> 09:19.011
I have to show stability
in the Street.

09:19.095 --> 09:22.428
Especially since I'm making
so many changes to the business.

09:22.512 --> 09:24.011
I'll run you through
all the numbers

09:24.095 --> 09:26.220
before tomorrow's
board meeting.

09:29.887 --> 09:31.595
Tomorrow is
Rebecca Cantu's first day

09:31.679 --> 09:33.095
as CEO of Saler's.

09:33.178 --> 09:35.428
I want it to be
a bad one for her-

09:35.512 --> 09:38.136
Which will ruin Bobby Axelrod's
fucking day too.

09:38.220 --> 09:39.428
I want her to think
the board is hers,

09:39.512 --> 09:41.261
then find out
it's really mine.

09:41.345 --> 09:43.679
We've met with three of the
largest individual stakeholders

09:43.762 --> 09:45.845
and accumulated a position,
but not enough to be a threat.

09:45.929 --> 09:47.887
After all the shares Axe
and Cantu bought up,

09:47.970 --> 09:49.512
there's not much left
out there we can get

09:49.595 --> 09:51.220
without causing the price
to skyrocket.

09:51.303 --> 09:52.762
But there is
a white whale out there-

09:52.845 --> 09:54.470
Saler's biggest debtholder-

09:54.553 --> 09:56.095
and you haven't put his blubber
within reach.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.887
You're talking about
Sanford Bensinger,

09:57.970 --> 10:01.303
Mr. Giving Oath,
the "American Champion."

10:01.387 --> 10:02.553
I am.

10:02.637 --> 10:04.887
Good.
Grab your harpoon.

10:04.970 --> 10:06.679
You got the meeting
with Bensinger?

10:06.762 --> 10:08.845
I'm taking his son, Landry,
to breakfast.

10:08.929 --> 10:10.637
He'll get us the meeting.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.261
Tomorrow morning?

10:12.345 --> 10:15.303
Tonight. And you're
coming with, Taylor.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.303
No work allowed
on site.

10:23.387 --> 10:25.637
Does it look like I'm here
to rivet the girders?

10:25.720 --> 10:27.637
Family business.

10:35.804 --> 10:37.512
I'm getting
starved out.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.303
If we don't
resume work here soon,

10:39.387 --> 10:41.387
the-the-the loans
are gonna crush me

10:41.470 --> 10:43.553
like a steel worker
in a hydraulic press.

10:43.637 --> 10:45.762
What would you
have me do?

10:45.845 --> 10:47.595
Prostrate myself
before Jock and Connerty?

10:47.679 --> 10:51.428
Hell no!
Find a way to hurt them back.

10:51.512 --> 10:53.970
Get them into the same kind of
vise that they have us in.

10:54.053 --> 10:57.720
And then crank the handle
so hard they beg you to relent.

10:57.804 --> 11:00.637
And they relent
in return.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.804
I need men
and trucks in here.

11:03.887 --> 11:07.679
Hoh man, did the wind
just change?

11:09.637 --> 11:11.929
What in God's name
is that smell? It's brutal...

11:12.011 --> 11:14.428
It's the fucking
porta potties!

11:14.512 --> 11:16.762
I need them
carted out of here.

11:16.845 --> 11:18.887
Whatever it is
construction workers consume,

11:18.970 --> 11:21.929
their night soil is not
fit for breathing.

11:22.011 --> 11:24.011
I've taken to putting Vicks
under my nose

11:24.095 --> 11:25.762
to mask the stench.

11:25.845 --> 11:27.303
Ah.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.512
Dad...

11:30.595 --> 11:32.345
where does it
normally go?

11:32.428 --> 11:33.637
The shit?

11:33.720 --> 11:35.220
Yeah.

11:35.303 --> 11:37.470
Fuck if I know.
It gets trucked out of here.

11:37.553 --> 11:38.387
I don't know
where it ends up.

11:38.470 --> 11:41.345
dramatic music

11:41.428 --> 11:44.011
Where are you going?

11:44.095 --> 11:45.845
To crank.

11:45.929 --> 11:47.637
So they beg.

11:57.053 --> 11:58.637
Hoses.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.720
Long, industrial hoses,
called cakasuckas on job sites,

12:01.804 --> 12:03.845
extract the waste
from the portajohns

12:03.929 --> 12:05.512
into specially treated
sanitation trucks.

12:05.595 --> 12:07.303
Goes into
the city sewage system

12:07.387 --> 12:10.053
where it is dehydrated into
a solid and compressed...

12:10.136 --> 12:12.095
Yeah, yeah, and eventually
it all winds up in a landfill.

12:12.178 --> 12:13.970
Far, far away
from New York.

12:14.053 --> 12:16.178
Via the way of
John Henry's hammer.

12:16.261 --> 12:18.136
A long cross-country
train ride.

12:18.220 --> 12:19.679
To here.

12:19.762 --> 12:23.970
Karl, we're about to
redraw the route

12:24.053 --> 12:26.095
for this foul piece
of transport.

12:30.762 --> 12:33.595
Thank you.

12:33.679 --> 12:35.220
You can go.

12:35.303 --> 12:37.178
No.

12:37.261 --> 12:39.637
I get to watch.

12:53.053 --> 12:54.595
How was it?

12:54.679 --> 12:55.637
Go.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.178
You're right.

12:57.261 --> 13:00.679
Sometimes words can't speak
what we both know.

13:00.762 --> 13:03.679
There's this site,
Beautiful Agony,

13:03.762 --> 13:05.595
that is all about
the O face,

13:05.679 --> 13:07.845
and looking at you right now
I can sense-

13:07.929 --> 13:10.428
You are like an over-caffeinated
serial killer.

13:10.512 --> 13:13.053
Go!

13:15.345 --> 13:18.470
We should talk about what
happened in the meditation room.

13:18.553 --> 13:22.261
I hit you in the face.

13:22.345 --> 13:23.845
You held me.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.303
We bonded.

13:25.387 --> 13:28.095
We should bond
some more.

13:28.178 --> 13:31.136
Drinks, after work tonight,
just the two of us.

13:31.220 --> 13:33.929
I usually only go out with
people who have one wife.

13:34.011 --> 13:37.345
There was vibe.
I don't mistake vibe.

13:37.428 --> 13:40.428
You got a stiffie because
your head was between my tits.

13:40.512 --> 13:41.553
That's not vibe.

13:41.637 --> 13:42.845
It is where I come from.

13:42.929 --> 13:44.929
Where's that, 1954?

13:50.970 --> 13:52.929
It's happening again.

13:54.845 --> 13:57.178
The droogs are starting to
fall all over themselves,

13:57.261 --> 13:58.970
fall over me.

13:59.053 --> 14:01.095
I have noticed a certain

14:01.178 --> 14:03.970
increased level of interest
on the floor.

14:04.053 --> 14:06.428
Since I mentioned getting
"railed" at my birthday.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.970
I see it-the way Spyros
brings you that cortado

14:10.053 --> 14:13.011
every day at 11,
lingers by your desk...

14:13.095 --> 14:16.762
At least chatty Lurch
makes good fucking coffee.

14:16.845 --> 14:18.929
But today
it was Dollar Bill.

14:19.011 --> 14:20.637
And that's different.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.220
You want to know
the best way to blow him off

14:22.303 --> 14:23.720
without fucking up
the workplace?

14:23.804 --> 14:26.887
More like: the best way
to do the thing

14:26.970 --> 14:28.887
without fucking up
the workplace.

14:34.428 --> 14:37.595
Are you thinking of him as
a love partner or a sex partner?

14:37.679 --> 14:41.387
When you put it that way,
I'm thinking about yakking-

14:42.845 --> 14:46.011
I'm feeling a bit
fucked...over.

14:46.095 --> 14:47.887
And a little afraid
of what I might do.

14:48.011 --> 14:49.387
I like the way you're
owning that, Ben Kim.

14:49.470 --> 14:51.053
But I am in session.

14:51.136 --> 14:54.261
Bonnie should hear this.
It concerns her, too.

14:55.804 --> 14:59.387
I've just learned Axe Cap
maintains a fund for employees.

14:59.470 --> 15:01.720
Yeah, that's why
we fucking work here.

15:01.804 --> 15:03.261
To get our money
invested here

15:03.345 --> 15:04.804
and beat everyone
else's returns.

15:04.887 --> 15:08.720
No, a separate, elite fund
called Flagship.

15:08.804 --> 15:10.261
Where returns are,
apparently,

15:10.345 --> 15:12.136
three times greater
than the main fund.

15:12.220 --> 15:15.303
But only "key employees"
are in it.

15:15.387 --> 15:18.845
I'm a PM...
and I'm not.

15:18.929 --> 15:21.011
Wendy,
are you in it?

15:21.095 --> 15:23.387
I haven't heard anyone
mention Flagship in years.

15:23.470 --> 15:25.470
I think Axe liquidated
funds like that

15:25.553 --> 15:27.845
when he ran into
his legal troubles.

15:27.929 --> 15:30.303
So I should let go
of this anger?

15:30.387 --> 15:34.220
Or hold onto it for the day
and see where it takes you.

15:34.303 --> 15:37.011
I'll let it go.

15:37.095 --> 15:38.428
Thanks, Wendy.

15:42.178 --> 15:44.345
You didn't
answer his question.

15:44.428 --> 15:46.220
I think I did.

15:46.303 --> 15:48.470
Not fully.

15:48.553 --> 15:51.428
Not the part about whether
you were invested in Flagship.

15:51.512 --> 15:54.011
Didn't I?
Huh.

15:54.095 --> 15:55.720
How 'bout yours?
Did I answer those?

15:55.804 --> 16:00.887
Yeah. I know just what I need to
do with Dollar Bill now.

16:02.929 --> 16:05.553
dramatic music

16:05.637 --> 16:07.595
We're on, buddy.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.095
Vibe.

16:13.178 --> 16:15.929
I fuckin' knew it.

16:16.011 --> 16:17.553
Name the place.

16:17.637 --> 16:20.345
How about, "I Thought
You Were a Real Man,

16:20.428 --> 16:22.720
So You Fuckin' Name It."

16:27.970 --> 16:29.970
You got room
for improvement.

16:30.053 --> 16:33.428
Not much.

16:36.303 --> 16:38.637
I am kicking ass
and taking names.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.720
Only I ran out of names,

16:40.804 --> 16:42.762
so now it's just
ass-kicking all the time.

16:42.845 --> 16:44.095
Join the club.

16:44.178 --> 16:47.053
Is it an exclusive one?

16:47.136 --> 16:49.679
You know it.

16:49.762 --> 16:51.220
Because I like entrÃ©e.

16:53.261 --> 16:57.220
There's another exclusive club
I'd like to be in-

16:58.762 --> 17:01.970
the Flagship Fund.

17:02.053 --> 17:04.470
How the fuck do you know
about Flagship?

17:04.553 --> 17:06.929
First rule of Flagship is
you don't talk about Flagship.

17:07.011 --> 17:08.929
You should know it was
talked about to me.

17:09.011 --> 17:10.970
Someone influential
was whispering

17:11.053 --> 17:13.637
that it might be
on my horizon.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.220
Huh.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.553
Yeah, I could
see that for you.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.178
If you keep it up-

17:20.261 --> 17:22.595
What are the odds of me not?

17:22.679 --> 17:25.261
Just saying-
it is a big deal though.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.637
You gotta be like Eric Roberts
and Chris Penn-

17:27.720 --> 17:29.512
Best of the Best.

17:29.595 --> 17:32.845
So you're in?

17:32.929 --> 17:38.595
Fuck yeah,
ever since I...uh...

17:38.679 --> 17:41.595
showed Axe how I always
manage to come through.

17:41.679 --> 17:43.845
Alongside
Axe and Wags...

17:43.929 --> 17:46.345
And Wendy, yeah.

17:46.428 --> 17:48.845
And the rewards
are substantial?

17:48.929 --> 17:51.929
Big enough to afford
two families,

17:52.011 --> 17:55.428
with two sets of kids,
all with straight teeth.

17:55.512 --> 17:58.720
dramatic music

18:06.261 --> 18:09.011
How, with your vast knowledge
of NYC nightlife,

18:09.095 --> 18:10.470
did you settle
on this place?

18:10.553 --> 18:12.679
It'll make more sense
to you soon.

18:19.428 --> 18:20.845
Never mention his dad.

18:20.929 --> 18:22.679
Never mention business.

18:22.762 --> 18:23.929
Unless you get him to.

18:24.011 --> 18:25.261
Then how am I gonna-

18:25.345 --> 18:26.428
By being yourself.

18:26.512 --> 18:28.220
Wow.

18:28.303 --> 18:29.428
This place.

18:29.512 --> 18:30.595
The colors.

18:30.679 --> 18:31.970
Throwback.

18:32.053 --> 18:33.553
I've never
been here before.

18:33.637 --> 18:35.595
Taylor picked it.

18:35.679 --> 18:38.011
You did, huh?

18:38.095 --> 18:40.428
Yeah. I dig the ironic
camp of the place.

18:40.512 --> 18:44.220
Nope. I saw your face
when you walked in.

18:44.303 --> 18:45.595
You weren't smiling
ironically.

18:45.679 --> 18:47.345
You were taken with it.
As I am.

18:47.428 --> 18:48.720
It makes me
get back in touch

18:48.804 --> 18:50.011
with the child-like
part of myself.

18:50.095 --> 18:52.136
Not childish.
Child-like.

18:52.220 --> 18:53.679
I embrace
that part of me.

18:53.762 --> 18:55.387
It's the most creative,
most engaged part,

18:55.470 --> 18:57.887
the part that continues to push
the rest of me to grow.

18:58.011 --> 19:01.428
Yeah. Yes.
That's right.

19:01.512 --> 19:03.220
What's more evocative
than the smell

19:03.303 --> 19:05.261
of your favorite cereal
from when you were a kid.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.887
I don't know why I said
that ironic thing.

19:07.970 --> 19:09.261
Because you are human,

19:09.345 --> 19:11.261
and we are here in this city,
at this time.

19:11.345 --> 19:12.637
You were worried
you gave yourself away.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.303
Don't worry. You did.
And it was great to see.

19:16.637 --> 19:18.512
What was your flavor?

19:18.595 --> 19:20.595
Honey Smacks.

19:20.679 --> 19:24.136
When I was a kid, I only got to
eat cereal once a week.

19:24.220 --> 19:27.303
My father wanted me to have
better habits than he did.

19:27.387 --> 19:29.053
I still feel a little guilty
when I eat it.

19:29.136 --> 19:30.929
But I love it.

19:31.011 --> 19:32.887
And this place.

19:32.970 --> 19:35.011
You nailed me, Taylor.
That was impressive.

19:35.095 --> 19:37.011
Get to know
each other.

19:37.095 --> 19:39.345
Taylor, I'll circle back.

19:42.011 --> 19:42.845
Frosted Flakes for me.

19:42.929 --> 19:44.845
Grrreeeeat!

19:44.929 --> 19:46.470
dramatic music

19:48.887 --> 19:50.887
Lauren, you were right.

19:50.970 --> 19:52.428
I'll set up the meeting.

19:52.512 --> 19:54.929
No guarantees
beyond that.

19:55.011 --> 19:58.553
My father sees things I don't,
which is why he is who he is.

19:58.637 --> 20:01.053
But I feel comfortable
getting you in the room.

20:05.387 --> 20:07.345
That was a big
fucking risk you took,

20:07.428 --> 20:09.345
going off book like that
without telling me.

20:09.428 --> 20:12.512
Nah.
I knew you'd crush it.

20:13.970 --> 20:18.845
It was fun as hell watching you
think on the fly like that.

20:18.929 --> 20:22.303
You just come alive
to the challenge.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.220
And then seeing him
have that feeling of

20:25.303 --> 20:28.053
someone recognizing
who he really was.

20:28.136 --> 20:32.387
You picked up on
all that, huh?

20:32.470 --> 20:34.470
Think I like knowing
you're watching that closely.

20:34.553 --> 20:40.261
So, nah, that wasn't
a risk at all.

20:42.762 --> 20:46.136
But this-this is.

20:46.220 --> 20:53.136
soft music

21:18.053 --> 21:19.470
We broke
some rules here.

21:19.553 --> 21:22.595
Must be why
it was so much fun.

21:22.679 --> 21:25.428
For the record
I kissed you first.

21:25.512 --> 21:28.387
But maybe we don't mention this
to Sara either way-

21:29.595 --> 21:31.845
Don't mention what to me?

21:31.929 --> 21:34.303
Lauren's got some moves

21:34.387 --> 21:36.136
that don't include
shots and nightclubs.

21:36.220 --> 21:37.345
She landed us
the Bensinger meeting

21:37.428 --> 21:38.970
in a very
child-friendly way.

21:39.053 --> 21:41.762
Nice. Good to know.

21:41.845 --> 21:46.428
Yeah, but keep it low,
I don't want to ruin my rep.

21:50.136 --> 21:52.428
dramatic music

21:52.512 --> 21:54.970
State Attorney General
Rhoades,

21:55.053 --> 21:57.470
what causes you to
darken my doorstep?

21:57.553 --> 21:59.762
Like Moses giving
Pharaoh a chance

21:59.845 --> 22:02.762
before the plagues were visited
upon Egypt, I come to-

22:02.845 --> 22:06.261
When heathens quoth from
the book of the Good, I recoil.

22:06.345 --> 22:09.595
Still.
Heed my word.

22:09.679 --> 22:11.261
Don't make
Pharaoh's mistake.

22:12.887 --> 22:14.970
You want me to
remove the blockade.

22:15.053 --> 22:17.887
And if I don't, what?

22:17.970 --> 22:19.595
Pestilence? Locusts?

22:19.679 --> 22:21.845
You will be visited by
horrors of that scope.

22:21.929 --> 22:24.220
Yes.
As will your family.

22:24.303 --> 22:25.887
Since you have
encumbered mine.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.470
So. Simply free my father
from the bonds-

22:28.553 --> 22:31.095
Well, first: if the Almighty is
speaking through one of us,

22:31.178 --> 22:33.053
I can assure you,
it's me.

22:33.136 --> 22:34.845
Because I kneel before him.

22:34.929 --> 22:36.553
On the daily.
Hmm.

22:36.637 --> 22:39.887
Second: He's the only one
I get on my knees for.

22:39.970 --> 22:41.261
Or ever will.

22:41.345 --> 22:43.345
I don't ask for
your bended knee.

22:43.428 --> 22:46.261
Only that you take it
off my father's neck.

22:46.345 --> 22:48.428
You put your pappy
in this position, Chuck,

22:48.512 --> 22:50.095
when you stood against me.

22:50.178 --> 22:52.345
And now
he pays the price.

22:52.428 --> 22:55.220
How dare you fucking
come down here

22:55.303 --> 22:57.970
from that cesspool of a city
to threaten me.

22:58.053 --> 23:00.303
I can even smell it on ya
a little-

23:00.387 --> 23:02.512
Oh, you think you can smell
all that on me now?

23:02.595 --> 23:05.637
'S right.
Putrefying my pristine air.

23:05.720 --> 23:07.804
As do your perversions
of scripture.

23:14.136 --> 23:16.345
That is the 12:02.

23:16.428 --> 23:18.804
That is your cue
to vamoose.

23:18.887 --> 23:20.845
Now, you best
get on out of here.

23:20.929 --> 23:23.595
You're right.

23:23.679 --> 23:26.303
Scent of Southern magnolias
surrounds you here.

23:26.387 --> 23:28.470
Mmm!

23:28.553 --> 23:32.053
Positively
redolent of 'em.

23:32.136 --> 23:34.261
dramatic music

23:39.428 --> 23:41.845
Alright everybody,
let's do this.

23:44.637 --> 23:46.845
I'm going to need to withdraw
from the board.

23:46.929 --> 23:47.929
Me, too.

23:48.011 --> 23:50.095
The fuck?
How come?

23:50.178 --> 23:52.679
We sold our shares.
Deal just came through.

23:52.762 --> 23:54.512
Nice premium,
couldn't pass it up.

23:54.595 --> 23:57.553
You bailed on me without even
hearing my plan.

23:57.637 --> 23:58.595
Who'd you sell to?

23:58.679 --> 24:00.345
I'd prefer not to say-

24:00.428 --> 24:04.345
Oh, I'm gonna
find out anyway.

24:04.428 --> 24:06.804
And when I do,
I'm gonna turn my focus

24:06.887 --> 24:10.178
from this business, onto each
of your personal holdings.

24:10.261 --> 24:13.553
And think about just how
I can take them to zero.

24:13.637 --> 24:16.220
I'm gonna run you down
into the dirt.

24:16.303 --> 24:18.970
And I'm gonna smile like
the Joker while I do it.

24:19.053 --> 24:21.845
Taylor Mason.

24:21.929 --> 24:24.345
Mason's meeting
with Sanford Bensinger,

24:24.428 --> 24:26.428
they're going to
have control.

24:26.512 --> 24:30.804
Resignations
fucking accepted.

24:30.887 --> 24:35.095
This meeting is postponed until
the board is reconstituted.

24:38.637 --> 24:40.428
With the amount of convertible
debt Bensinger controls,

24:40.512 --> 24:42.261
he's our largest creditor.

24:42.345 --> 24:46.261
He can convert it into enough
shares to dwarf our position.

24:46.345 --> 24:49.970
Then we'll get diluted
and our voting power shrinks.

24:50.053 --> 24:51.720
If he backs Taylor
they can run the company

24:51.804 --> 24:54.136
right from underneath me.
Or fire me.

24:54.220 --> 24:55.929
Kind of move he's made
many fucking times.

24:56.011 --> 24:58.011
You know him?

24:58.095 --> 25:00.178
Well. Maybe we can go
sue for peace. Work him.

25:00.261 --> 25:01.553
I do know him.

25:01.637 --> 25:03.345
But the kind of peace
that he'll grant

25:03.428 --> 25:04.970
is the type that has
my head on a pike.

25:05.053 --> 25:06.970
You have a remarkable
way with people.

25:07.053 --> 25:08.595
Thank you.

25:08.679 --> 25:12.387
But believe me,
we can't work this guy.

25:12.470 --> 25:14.595
No, it's time
to punish him.

25:21.470 --> 25:23.553
Okay, everybody, take
a nice, big, deep breath in.

25:23.637 --> 25:25.845
Roll your shoulders
all the way up and back.

25:25.929 --> 25:27.762
We got the final
stretch of class.

25:27.845 --> 25:31.220
It's never coast,
never quit.

25:31.303 --> 25:35.261
I need everything you got
all the way until the end.

25:35.345 --> 25:38.178
In three, two, let's go!

25:46.261 --> 25:50.970
That's five, four,
three, two, one!

25:51.053 --> 25:52.679
Done!

25:54.220 --> 25:56.970
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

26:03.762 --> 26:04.845
Dr. Gus.

26:04.929 --> 26:07.011
Yeah.

26:07.095 --> 26:09.011
G-man can pedal!

26:09.095 --> 26:10.470
Thought I had you.

26:10.553 --> 26:12.470
Yeah?
Yeah.

26:12.553 --> 26:15.679
Now, how often do you say
that...and turn out to be wrong?

26:15.762 --> 26:17.095
Next time,
I'll want it more.

26:17.178 --> 26:19.303
It's not enough
to want it more.

26:19.387 --> 26:21.679
I need to want it most?

26:21.762 --> 26:24.512
No.

26:24.595 --> 26:28.679
You need to sharpen your odachi
and slice a hole in the universe

26:28.762 --> 26:30.470
between you
and where you're going.

26:30.553 --> 26:31.845
And if you don't
cut down everyone

26:31.929 --> 26:33.720
and everything
that gets in your way,

26:33.804 --> 26:36.804
then they will return
and they will cut you to shreds

26:36.887 --> 26:40.595
and then they will cover
those shreds in bukkake.

26:42.053 --> 26:43.053
dramatic music

26:43.136 --> 26:45.053
Whoo!

26:48.261 --> 26:51.095
These mayors...

26:51.178 --> 26:53.720
We need easements on
their rail corridors.

26:53.804 --> 26:55.637
So they need to be
put to a decision:

26:55.720 --> 26:57.470
the sweet smell
of honeysuckle.

26:57.553 --> 26:59.345
Or the other.

26:59.428 --> 27:02.053
Warm 'em up and invite
each of 'em to a phone call

27:02.136 --> 27:03.762
upon which we give 'em
what they need.

27:03.845 --> 27:07.011
And threaten 'em
if they don't take it.

27:07.095 --> 27:10.512
Headlocking a bunch of
backwoods mayors, sounds grand.

27:10.595 --> 27:12.053
Mm.
Pizza or Thai?

27:12.136 --> 27:15.011
I too have a dinner
to attend.

27:15.095 --> 27:17.345
Bon appÃ©tit.

27:17.428 --> 27:21.095
Happy birthday, Kevin.

27:21.178 --> 27:23.553
Thanks, Grandpa.

27:23.637 --> 27:25.929
It's a fucking slinky.

27:26.011 --> 27:27.762
Now leave us alone
and make some fun out of that

27:27.845 --> 27:29.679
with your hands
and some hardwood stairs, huh?

27:32.845 --> 27:34.345
If he's still playing with it
tomorrow,

27:34.428 --> 27:36.970
put all of your energies
into the girl.

27:37.053 --> 27:39.595
I have energies enough for
all the people I love.

27:39.679 --> 27:43.345
Do you?
Because I haven't heard anything

27:43.428 --> 27:45.804
about a matter of
great personal importance.

27:45.887 --> 27:48.845
I might, in fact,
say the same thing.

27:50.470 --> 27:52.762
Well...

27:52.845 --> 27:54.845
I always thought you two,
coming together,

27:54.929 --> 27:57.470
united in a common cause
would be a good thing but-

27:57.553 --> 27:59.220
But nothing.

27:59.303 --> 28:01.720
Which is what I gather you're
delivering for each of us.

28:05.220 --> 28:06.637
I assure you

28:06.720 --> 28:08.804
I am laboring on
both of your causes.

28:08.887 --> 28:10.595
Save your assurance

28:10.679 --> 28:12.720
for those not so well versed
in your bullshit.

28:12.804 --> 28:14.595
Normally, I'd be aghast

28:14.679 --> 28:16.637
at a father speaking to
his son that way,

28:16.720 --> 28:19.428
but I know the motivational
power you hold over him.

28:19.512 --> 28:22.303
Sure, on the inside he may be
saying: "Fuck the old man."

28:22.387 --> 28:23.720
Screaming it.

28:23.804 --> 28:25.261
But he always
comes through.

28:25.345 --> 28:27.261
The need for your love.

28:27.345 --> 28:28.970
The shame
in not delivering...

28:29.053 --> 28:31.887
And, like a country doctor

28:31.970 --> 28:34.428
with an outbreak across
the shire to deal with,

28:34.512 --> 28:37.845
I'm gonna get back
to fucking work.

28:41.887 --> 28:46.470
Grateful Dead's
"Casey Jones"

28:46.553 --> 28:50.345
Driving that train

28:50.428 --> 28:52.220
High on cocaine

28:52.303 --> 28:57.679
Casey Jones, you better
watch your speed

28:57.762 --> 29:00.387
Trouble ahead

29:00.470 --> 29:02.553
Trouble behind

29:02.637 --> 29:07.553
And you know that notion
just crossed my mind

29:12.804 --> 29:17.428
This old engine
makes it on time

29:17.512 --> 29:22.220
Leaves Central Station
'bout a quarter to nine

29:22.303 --> 29:26.470
Hits River Junction
at seventeen two

29:26.553 --> 29:31.595
At a quarter to ten you know
it's travelin' again

29:31.679 --> 29:34.387
Driving that train

29:34.470 --> 29:36.428
High on cocaine

29:36.512 --> 29:39.011
Casey Jones, you better
watch your speed

29:39.095 --> 29:41.470
Hall said a Chinese consortium
is in town

29:41.553 --> 29:43.095
to buy
the Chrysler Building.

29:43.178 --> 29:45.303
Which is why
Bensinger is in town.

29:45.387 --> 29:47.929
So he's not just here to fuck
with me on Rebecca's company?

29:48.011 --> 29:49.929
He wants to keep it
out of Chinese hands.

29:50.011 --> 29:52.095
He's planning to
purchase it preemptively.

29:52.178 --> 29:54.220
Part of his little campaign
to preserve the nation.

29:54.303 --> 29:57.095
Sure. And he'll do it
without fanfare, too.

29:57.178 --> 29:58.512
That's what
he'll say anyway.

29:58.595 --> 30:00.220
That he wants
no recognition for it.

30:00.303 --> 30:02.220
But somehow,
he'll get it.

30:02.303 --> 30:05.970
Or maybe he won't,
huh?

30:06.053 --> 30:08.929
Yeah.

30:12.220 --> 30:14.679
The Flagship Fund
is "choice."

30:14.762 --> 30:16.887
And we should demand
our inclusion.

30:16.970 --> 30:19.387
Wendy misled me?

30:19.470 --> 30:20.970
That's how I knew
what was going on.

30:21.053 --> 30:23.053
Maybe it's not my time.

30:23.136 --> 30:25.303
Maybe if I wait
and keep my head down,

30:25.387 --> 30:26.637
I'll be rewarded
down the line.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.178
Said every
factory worker ever

30:28.261 --> 30:29.720
before watching his job
disappear,

30:29.804 --> 30:31.095
then going home
to beat his wife.

30:31.178 --> 30:34.136
Tell me you're just fine
with this caste system.

30:34.220 --> 30:37.595
Jesus. I don't think that's
an okay thing to say.

30:37.679 --> 30:42.053
Trying to make you angry enough
to fucking do something.

30:42.136 --> 30:44.553
You good being salarymen
in this place?

30:44.637 --> 30:46.512
I bust my ass.
I want my due.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.970
Yeah, seems right.

30:50.053 --> 30:51.720
We're in.

30:51.804 --> 30:55.762
up-tempo music

31:00.470 --> 31:04.595
A lot of physical force goes
into pulling a shot of espresso,

31:04.679 --> 31:07.136
and sometimes the torque
of said pull,

31:07.220 --> 31:10.136
leads to a follow-through arc
where one's hand could

31:10.220 --> 31:13.136
accidentally graze
the outer contours

31:13.220 --> 31:14.929
of a receptionist's
mammary.

31:15.011 --> 31:16.845
Whatever the fuck that is about,
take it to your grave.

31:16.929 --> 31:19.720
You're not in trouble.
At this moment.

31:19.804 --> 31:21.720
In fact, you are
urgently needed.

31:21.804 --> 31:25.553
How may I be of service,
fair maiden?

31:25.637 --> 31:27.136
Leadership.

31:27.220 --> 31:29.845
To take our demands
to Axe.

31:29.929 --> 31:31.261
You have his ear.

31:31.345 --> 31:35.011
My words do
traverse that regal canal

31:35.095 --> 31:37.762
like a vaporetto gliding
to the Piazza San Marco.

31:37.845 --> 31:43.136
Yes,
you are our man.

31:43.220 --> 31:48.178
dramatic music

31:51.512 --> 31:53.637
You know how many people
jumped from those buildings

31:53.720 --> 31:55.220
to their deaths
on Black Tuesday?

31:55.303 --> 31:57.595
Not a one.

31:57.679 --> 32:00.470
But people were so
upset with the banks,

32:00.553 --> 32:02.553
they wanted to believe.

32:02.637 --> 32:04.053
What will the future
believe about

32:04.136 --> 32:05.929
people who partnered
with Bobby Axelrod?

32:06.011 --> 32:09.220
I think you know
he's not my partner.

32:09.303 --> 32:11.011
Quite the opposite.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.470
But if you support
the Saler's board

32:12.553 --> 32:15.387
under Rebecca Cantu,
you are supporting him.

32:15.470 --> 32:18.595
My son said
you had a direct

32:18.679 --> 32:20.679
and incisive way
of looking at things.

32:20.762 --> 32:22.845
I've cultivated that
within myself.

32:22.929 --> 32:24.929
And your son is
a complete person.

32:25.011 --> 32:27.303
Not easy to achieve in a child
raised with billions.

32:27.387 --> 32:29.887
A credit to you both.

32:29.970 --> 32:32.845
Let's say I didn't want
to support Axe.

32:32.929 --> 32:35.595
Let's say I wanted
to pay him back

32:35.679 --> 32:37.929
in trouble and pain
for the high crimes

32:38.011 --> 32:39.970
and misdemeanors
he's committed against me.

32:40.053 --> 32:42.261
Then support me.

32:42.345 --> 32:44.512
Convert your debt into shares
and back me with them.

32:44.595 --> 32:46.261
I'm coming out shooting.
So's he.

32:46.345 --> 32:48.053
When we tally up the bodies,
it'll be a long ledger.

32:48.136 --> 32:50.136
But if you don't want it
to include Saler's,

32:50.220 --> 32:52.387
as I believe you don't,
because of your status,

32:52.470 --> 32:54.720
I'm your best
and only choice.

32:54.804 --> 32:57.470
dramatic music

33:05.345 --> 33:06.637
Why is he
our man?

33:06.720 --> 33:08.553
Because of what they thought
about Rambo-

33:08.637 --> 33:11.970
He's got PTSD and he's going to
tear apart the entire office?

33:12.053 --> 33:14.053
No, they thought
he was expendable.

33:14.136 --> 33:15.970
If he gets cut down
it's only him we've lost.

33:27.679 --> 33:29.053
Spyros.

33:29.136 --> 33:31.011
I don't like it
when you come in here.

33:31.095 --> 33:33.220
Especially don't like it
when you're smiling.

33:33.303 --> 33:36.095
I smile
the people's smile.

33:36.178 --> 33:39.011
For I am here, not in my
capacity as your grand vizier,

33:39.095 --> 33:41.053
but to bring
their demands unto you.

33:41.136 --> 33:42.637
Demands?

33:42.720 --> 33:44.553
One demand really.

33:44.637 --> 33:46.428
The Fundo De Flagship.

33:46.512 --> 33:48.053
What about it?

33:48.136 --> 33:49.762
That's a hands-off
situation.

33:49.845 --> 33:52.679
Access for all
Axe Cappers.

33:56.428 --> 33:57.887
And everyone out there

33:57.970 --> 33:59.512
is on board with
this campaign of yours?

34:07.512 --> 34:11.594
I know: "This is too much power
for one man to have."

34:11.679 --> 34:13.136
But I gots it.

34:13.219 --> 34:17.969
Spyros. Most who are first
pay the price.

34:18.053 --> 34:21.219
Very few exceptions:
Maybe Vaclav Havel?

34:21.303 --> 34:22.637
Lech Walesa?

34:22.719 --> 34:24.679
The tightrope guy?

34:24.762 --> 34:25.887
The Flying-

34:25.969 --> 34:27.512
No, you simp.

34:27.594 --> 34:29.844
Write down those names
and look 'em up later.

34:29.929 --> 34:31.553
I feel they could've
pulled this off.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.178
You can't.

34:39.387 --> 34:41.178
Now,
had you come up here

34:41.261 --> 34:43.594
and asked me the path
to the Flagship Fund,

34:43.679 --> 34:45.969
I would have told you...
you are compliance,

34:46.053 --> 34:48.344
you don't make enough,
and you are never getting in.

34:48.428 --> 34:51.344
Though the others could have
worked their way in.

34:51.428 --> 34:55.969
But since you rolled heavy,
no one is getting in ever again.

34:56.053 --> 34:58.178
There is no
Flagship Fund.

34:58.261 --> 34:59.929
It's a thing
of the past.

35:00.011 --> 35:01.804
Fucking dissolved.

35:01.887 --> 35:04.011
Everyone can eat
what they kill.

35:04.095 --> 35:06.053
And they can invest
in the main fund,

35:06.136 --> 35:09.095
side by side
with our clients.

35:09.178 --> 35:12.220
Now get out of here before
I don't even let you do that.

35:19.679 --> 35:22.595
dramatic music

35:28.679 --> 35:31.011
Is buying this building
so the Chinese can't

35:31.095 --> 35:32.512
part of
a nationalistic impulse?

35:32.595 --> 35:35.345
Don't forget you're not
a reporter at the moment-

35:35.428 --> 35:37.053
you're my ghostwriter.

35:37.136 --> 35:38.428
My WW Beauchamp.

35:38.512 --> 35:39.845
I still have to
ask the questions,

35:39.929 --> 35:41.679
to get to your mindset.

35:41.762 --> 35:45.220
The question shouldn't deal with
nastiness like nationalism.

35:45.303 --> 35:48.053
Some things should remain
American owned.

35:48.136 --> 35:50.053
Our greatest buildings
among them.

35:50.136 --> 35:52.637
Which is why
I'm buying this one.

35:52.720 --> 35:56.720
And why the book is gonna be
called "American Champion."

35:56.804 --> 35:57.887
You get all that?

35:57.970 --> 35:59.428
Yes, sir.
Great.

35:59.512 --> 36:01.220
Pleasure doing business
with you, Gary.

36:01.303 --> 36:03.637
Enjoy Montana.

36:03.720 --> 36:08.387
Sanford, I'm sorry
I wasted you a trip.

36:08.470 --> 36:10.428
But-
Well, this is awkward.

36:10.512 --> 36:12.303
He sold to
the higher bidder.

36:12.387 --> 36:15.512
You just made
a world class mistake.

36:15.595 --> 36:17.679
The fact is,
we overpaid.

36:17.762 --> 36:19.053
I didn't catch your-

36:19.136 --> 36:20.804
Why do you give a darn,
Sandy?

36:20.887 --> 36:23.845
Your priority was to keep this
building in American hands.

36:23.929 --> 36:25.387
And that's where
it is.

36:29.261 --> 36:30.929
Who the hell was that?

36:31.011 --> 36:34.679
That was Michael Wagner-
Bobby Axelrod's COO.

36:34.762 --> 36:36.887
Want to give it some context,
for you to overcome in the book?

36:36.970 --> 36:39.095
Turn that
goddamn thing off.

36:39.178 --> 36:41.345
dramatic music

36:41.428 --> 36:43.261
Time to stop
the motor of the world.

36:47.845 --> 36:51.637
Yes, Inspector, this looks like
a bona fide health risk.

36:51.720 --> 36:53.637
I don't know what color
you'd call that sludge

36:53.720 --> 36:55.303
coming out the sides
of those boxcars

36:55.387 --> 36:56.845
but you need to
stop this thing. Now.

36:56.929 --> 37:00.428
There's a biohazard sign
on the side, sir...

37:00.512 --> 37:02.512
but something's leaking.

37:02.595 --> 37:06.303
Best send a HAZMAT team.
Immediately...

37:06.387 --> 37:09.553
Yes, I can give you
the exact location...

37:15.053 --> 37:17.720
dramatic music

37:36.095 --> 37:37.970
Bless us, O Lord,
and these, Thy gifts,

37:38.053 --> 37:40.095
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty.

37:40.178 --> 37:41.303
Through Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

37:41.387 --> 37:43.095
Amen.

37:48.136 --> 37:51.345
Jock? My nose is picking up
an odor that is rather off...

37:51.428 --> 37:53.929
Oh. What is that?

37:54.011 --> 37:56.762
A goddamned plague...

37:56.845 --> 37:58.553
I-I feel as though
I might...

37:58.637 --> 38:00.095
Oh, lord...

38:00.178 --> 38:01.470
Oh, Jesus.

38:03.553 --> 38:05.387
That fucking train
is from New York City,

38:05.470 --> 38:07.261
courtesy of Rhoades.

38:07.345 --> 38:09.345
You were supposed to
have your arms around him.

38:09.428 --> 38:11.720
I do. NYPD is still
at the building site.

38:11.804 --> 38:12.970
Well,
it hasn't stopped him

38:13.053 --> 38:14.637
from deploying bio-weapons
against me!

38:14.720 --> 38:16.679
Maybe you're so used
to the foul and fetid

38:16.762 --> 38:19.011
up there in New York City
that it doesn't faze you.

38:19.095 --> 38:21.095
But I consider it
a fucking war crime!

38:21.178 --> 38:23.804
Yes, General.

38:23.887 --> 38:26.261
We need to slice
a hole in the universe,

38:26.345 --> 38:28.679
cut down everyone
and everything in our way,

38:28.762 --> 38:32.512
or they will return to
cut us into shreds and...

38:32.595 --> 38:35.970
do some fucked up stuff
to those shreds.

38:39.011 --> 38:41.679
I don't care about waiting for
biothreat testing to come back

38:41.762 --> 38:44.095
or your investigation-
move that fucking train

38:44.178 --> 38:46.387
or I start
investigating you!

38:49.512 --> 38:50.887
Don't strain your neck
like that.

38:50.970 --> 38:52.220
Liable to pull a muscle.

38:52.303 --> 38:53.470
Breathe, you know?

38:53.553 --> 38:55.095
Later.

38:55.178 --> 38:57.011
If I don't get that shit train
out of there,

38:57.095 --> 38:59.553
I'm gonna have a first class
ticket on it. Any ideas?

38:59.637 --> 39:01.970
Tighten things up
at the construction site.

39:02.053 --> 39:03.261
Start looking
for violations.

39:03.345 --> 39:05.595
And suffocate 'em
with fines...

39:05.679 --> 39:09.887
Or skip the JV shit
and let's just take 'em.

39:09.970 --> 39:11.387
For bribing Biancarosa

39:11.470 --> 39:12.804
and everything else
we got on the wire.

39:12.887 --> 39:16.428
I can't engage with
marginal junk. Not now.

39:16.512 --> 39:19.470
What I need is
the Brass Brazilians.

39:19.553 --> 39:21.845
I'll go see what
I can come up with.

39:25.887 --> 39:27.887
Kornbluth called.
He wouldn't talk.

39:27.970 --> 39:29.887
He's protecting his sinecure
with Bensinger.

39:29.970 --> 39:31.220
One thing I did
yank out of him:

39:31.303 --> 39:32.929
Bensinger had a good meeting
with Taylor.

39:33.011 --> 39:35.261
With Bensinger behind Taylor,
I am boxed in.

39:35.345 --> 39:36.512
'Fucked' is the word.

39:36.595 --> 39:38.303
I'm fucked.
I know.

39:38.387 --> 39:40.637
Why hasn't the Chrysler move
gotten him in here yet?

39:40.720 --> 39:42.053
What else can we do?

39:42.136 --> 39:43.303
Give it time to work.

39:43.387 --> 39:44.595
For the salt to settle
in the wound.

39:44.679 --> 39:47.512
To grind on
his sense of self...

39:47.595 --> 39:48.887
What the hell?

39:48.970 --> 39:51.720
I thought I ended this.

39:53.553 --> 39:56.345
Mm. Can you do that,
appropriate the glove?

39:56.428 --> 39:57.887
They just did.

39:57.970 --> 40:00.470
You get back to your
stations right now!

40:00.553 --> 40:06.762
dramatic music

40:06.845 --> 40:09.345
Shall I line 'em all up
Paths of Glory style

40:09.428 --> 40:10.887
and give 'em what
they're asking for?

40:10.970 --> 40:14.053
Mass firing? No-what more of
a distraction do we need?...

40:17.970 --> 40:20.679
Oh, shit.

40:20.762 --> 40:22.011
Wendy!

40:26.845 --> 40:29.053
Something about this whole
Sandinista revolt thing

40:29.136 --> 40:30.470
isn't clear to me.

40:31.845 --> 40:35.178
Where did it
all start?

40:35.261 --> 40:37.929
up-tempo music

40:47.845 --> 40:50.345
You were the one who went to
Wendy about the Flagship Fund.

40:50.428 --> 40:52.804
Where'd you find out
about it?

40:52.887 --> 40:55.929
I shouldn't answer, I should
hold strong for my source.

40:59.428 --> 41:00.762
Damnit...

41:00.845 --> 41:01.762
Really...?

41:01.845 --> 41:04.220
Tuk, who fed you?

41:04.303 --> 41:07.762
Oh, God, it was Danzig.

41:07.845 --> 41:10.679
He was going to write you
an email asking in.

41:10.762 --> 41:12.887
He asked me to review it
before he hit send.

41:13.011 --> 41:14.929
He didn't hit send.

41:15.011 --> 41:17.345
So many angry words.

41:17.428 --> 41:19.053
So many other words
misspelled.

41:19.136 --> 41:21.011
So. How'd the Flagship
come to you-

41:21.095 --> 41:26.970
rumor of the old days
or fresh information? Hmm?

41:27.053 --> 41:30.428
Or did your seat neighbor
spill?

41:30.512 --> 41:31.679
Hey!
I kept my mouth shut...

41:35.011 --> 41:37.428
Except when I fucked up
and told Bonnie.

41:37.512 --> 41:39.178
I first heard it
from Ben Kim.

41:40.470 --> 41:42.011
The circle closes.

41:42.095 --> 41:43.428
And tightens.

41:43.512 --> 41:45.595
Which leaves
our source as...

41:49.136 --> 41:50.261
Glad you landed
back on your feet.

41:50.345 --> 41:52.178
Hope they're taking care
of you.

41:52.261 --> 41:55.637
You in the Flagship yet?

41:55.720 --> 41:58.637
This whole thing
was a psy-op

41:58.720 --> 42:01.220
to ruin our morale
and our productivity-

42:01.303 --> 42:02.553
Worked pretty damn well-

42:02.637 --> 42:05.345
And you all fucking bit.

42:05.428 --> 42:09.679
But this is not
a union shop.

42:09.762 --> 42:11.720
There's no limit to
what you can earn here.

42:11.804 --> 42:16.845
So take responsibility and get
back on it right fucking now.

42:16.929 --> 42:18.178
And you...

42:18.261 --> 42:20.470
Shit, Axe,
I got fucking used.

42:20.553 --> 42:23.637
I don't deserve to
be in the Flagship.

42:23.720 --> 42:25.011
I don't deserve to
work here at all.

42:25.095 --> 42:26.679
No, no, no.

42:26.762 --> 42:29.428
You stay here, you stay alive
and you suffer.

42:29.512 --> 42:31.095
I'll deal with you later.

42:31.178 --> 42:32.679
dramatic music

42:32.762 --> 42:34.970
You're gonna wish your way out
was so easy.

42:38.512 --> 42:40.220
Matter of time now.

42:40.303 --> 42:43.303
What? Before Connerty finds out
about my jail visit? Yep.

42:43.387 --> 42:46.011
Should be enough to break the
blockade on your father's site.

42:46.095 --> 42:47.679
Mm.
But it was a gamble

42:47.762 --> 42:49.512
putting Wendy's thing in play
in your fight.

42:49.595 --> 42:52.178
You play the pass line,
you can only win small.

42:52.261 --> 42:54.345
Not the game I'm in.

42:54.428 --> 42:56.178
But I've gotta find out
what Jock wants,

42:56.261 --> 42:57.720
what matters most to him.

42:57.804 --> 43:02.261
You wanted something,
I have something.

43:02.345 --> 43:04.178
Visitor log.

43:04.261 --> 43:05.804
From the federal prison

43:05.887 --> 43:08.095
where a certain doctor
is serving his time.

43:08.178 --> 43:11.053
dramatic music

43:22.970 --> 43:25.095
Right this way.

43:40.387 --> 43:43.595
That only took a little
longer than I thought.

43:43.679 --> 43:46.762
For me to figure out you bought
that building to fuck with me?

43:46.845 --> 43:49.303
No. For your ego to rise up
and make this all about

43:49.387 --> 43:53.303
you not being the one to
save it-American Champion.

43:53.387 --> 43:56.762
Guess it takes a narcissistic
egomaniac to know one.

43:56.845 --> 43:59.095
Fair enough.

43:59.178 --> 44:01.178
What now?

44:01.261 --> 44:03.220
You flip it to
a Chinese national company

44:03.303 --> 44:05.261
at a steep profit just to
rub it in my face?

44:05.345 --> 44:06.720
Actually, no.

44:06.804 --> 44:08.720
But you can if you want.

44:08.804 --> 44:10.679
Because
I'm selling it to you.

44:10.762 --> 44:13.303
At my cost.

44:13.387 --> 44:18.011
Well that pitch had some break
on it I didn't pick up.

44:18.095 --> 44:20.220
Well, I knew you'd be leaning
into the fastball

44:20.303 --> 44:22.428
of me selling off
a chunk of Americana,

44:22.512 --> 44:24.595
so I had to come
with the hook.

44:24.679 --> 44:26.512
And I'll let you
take all the credit

44:26.595 --> 44:28.345
for protecting
our national heritage

44:28.428 --> 44:31.512
and give you that
last chapter of your book.

44:31.595 --> 44:34.053
This is about
Saler's then.

44:34.136 --> 44:36.845
Yes. It is.
And trying to persuade you

44:36.929 --> 44:40.553
not to side with Taylor Mason
against Rebecca Cantu.

44:40.637 --> 44:44.303
The Saler's chain is bigger than
your personal feuds, Axelrod.

44:44.387 --> 44:45.720
Indeed it is.

44:45.804 --> 44:47.845
Which is why I had to
get you here.

44:52.428 --> 44:54.095
You two haven't met.

44:54.178 --> 44:56.470
We know one another
by reputation.

44:56.553 --> 44:59.845
And yours is a very good one,
Ms. Cantu.

44:59.929 --> 45:02.178
Rebecca has the best vision
for this company.

45:02.261 --> 45:03.929
So I'm gonna turn this
over to her.

45:04.011 --> 45:05.970
It's her project,
her passion...

45:06.053 --> 45:08.970
And my chance to take something
that mattered to me

45:09.053 --> 45:10.303
and make it matter again.

45:10.387 --> 45:11.970
Why?

45:12.053 --> 45:14.136
You know this even better
than I do, Sanford.

45:14.220 --> 45:16.387
But legacy
is important.

45:16.470 --> 45:19.720
So I want this now,
today,

45:19.804 --> 45:22.679
as a businesswoman,
for my legacy-

45:22.762 --> 45:25.136
so I can say I did
what others couldn't.

45:25.220 --> 45:29.679
But I also want it for the
little girl that I once was.

45:29.762 --> 45:32.053
And publicly I say that girl
was allowed to dream

45:32.136 --> 45:35.220
by looking at the catalog,
but you know the truth:

45:35.303 --> 45:37.637
My parents-My parents couldn't
afford to buy me anything.

45:37.720 --> 45:41.428
And I promised that one day
I would buy it for myself.

45:41.512 --> 45:44.637
So now I want
to own it all.

45:44.720 --> 45:47.178
That kind of personal stake
can be very risky-

45:47.261 --> 45:49.053
But I'm not
a child anymore.

45:49.136 --> 45:50.637
And when you read my plan,

45:50.720 --> 45:52.553
you will see a clear
march forward

45:52.637 --> 45:55.637
to massive profitability.

45:55.720 --> 45:58.053
And the ice cream fountains?
I'm keeping them.

45:58.136 --> 46:00.470
Alongside
an artisanal coffee bar.

46:00.553 --> 46:02.345
Because coffee
is good business

46:02.428 --> 46:04.220
and addictive
and we'll sell enough of it

46:04.303 --> 46:06.053
to float the entire
fucking enterprise.

46:06.136 --> 46:08.512
And ice cream
is delicious

46:08.595 --> 46:10.720
and it's the perfect reward
for everything.

46:10.804 --> 46:14.428
But ice cream,
at a fountain-

46:16.178 --> 46:20.845
I mean, that makes you feel free
and young, like-

46:20.929 --> 46:22.679
An American.

46:22.762 --> 46:26.637
You want Saler's
to be America.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.220
That's right.

46:28.303 --> 46:30.095
And, wait,
there's more:

46:30.178 --> 46:31.512
I'm stepping off
the board.

46:31.595 --> 46:32.845
You two should work
closely on this,

46:32.929 --> 46:34.220
and I don't need
to be in the way-

46:34.303 --> 46:35.845
Bobby-

46:35.929 --> 46:37.470
Sanford can take my place
on the board.

46:37.553 --> 46:39.387
It's a net PR win
for everyone.

46:39.470 --> 46:42.512
No.

46:42.595 --> 46:44.762
The company needs Sanford.
For sure.

46:44.845 --> 46:47.095
But I need you there
helping me steer this.

46:47.178 --> 46:50.470
You've already protected it
like a pit bull

46:50.553 --> 46:53.095
in this opening salvo.

46:53.178 --> 46:57.512
If I hadn't seen it,
I wouldn't have believed it.

46:57.595 --> 47:02.095
Bobby Axelrod actually gives
a goddamn-enough to walk away.

47:02.178 --> 47:06.512
And you actually giving enough
of a goddamn about him

47:06.595 --> 47:08.804
to risk me walking away.

47:08.887 --> 47:10.553
That's the kind of
strength and loyalty

47:10.637 --> 47:12.679
great brands
are built on.

47:12.762 --> 47:14.804
I want that at the heart
of this company.

47:14.887 --> 47:18.178
And I want the wattage in
your combined brain pan too.

47:18.261 --> 47:22.762
Okay,
keep your board seat.

47:22.845 --> 47:24.470
I'm not going with
Taylor Mason.

47:24.553 --> 47:26.053
I share your vision.

47:26.136 --> 47:30.053
But what really sold me is
the two of you. Together.

47:30.136 --> 47:32.762
Ms. Cantu, if you can
make this fallen man

47:32.845 --> 47:35.220
part of something good,

47:35.303 --> 47:38.261
you can make us all
part of something great.

47:38.345 --> 47:42.345
dramatic music

47:53.720 --> 47:55.679
I'm gonna need you to tell me
what Chuck Rhoades wanted.

47:55.762 --> 47:57.178
And I need to know now...

48:26.553 --> 48:29.178
Now I know what this is
really all about...

48:29.261 --> 48:31.512
I missed it at first,
but now I see.

48:31.595 --> 48:33.261
See what?

48:33.345 --> 48:37.178
That sure, this is a psy-op,
like I said.

48:37.261 --> 48:39.595
That it was about
the Flagship Fund.

48:39.679 --> 48:41.595
But it's more than that.

48:43.553 --> 48:45.845
This is a move.

48:45.929 --> 48:46.804
On you.

48:46.887 --> 48:49.720
Is that right?
Yeah.

48:49.804 --> 48:52.261
That's what all this was,

48:52.345 --> 48:55.178
on top of sowing
general chaos in here

48:55.261 --> 48:57.512
and distracting me
from the billionaire

48:57.595 --> 48:59.470
that I was tangling with:

48:59.553 --> 49:02.011
this is Taylor
poaching you-

49:02.095 --> 49:05.053
I see how they all
look to you out there-

49:05.136 --> 49:07.261
and Taylor must have
figured it out too.

49:07.345 --> 49:09.845
They're going to reach out
to you, come at you...

49:14.637 --> 49:16.178
Or did they already?

49:16.261 --> 49:18.428
It's possible.

49:22.929 --> 49:25.303
When you take that
meeting with Taylor,

49:25.387 --> 49:27.887
you tell them that you are
staying at Axe Capital.

49:27.970 --> 49:29.929
Because Axe values you.

49:30.011 --> 49:33.053
So much so, in fact, that
he's reopened the Flagship Fund

49:33.136 --> 49:36.470
under a different name
and put you in it.

49:36.553 --> 49:39.303
Which I just did.

49:39.387 --> 49:42.136
Nah.

49:42.220 --> 49:44.887
I'm not gonna
tell Taylor that.

49:44.970 --> 49:47.345
dramatic music

49:47.428 --> 49:49.679
Axe should have put you
in the Flagship Fund.

49:49.762 --> 49:52.136
Come aboard here
and you'll be treated right.

49:58.220 --> 50:01.387
Hey Taylor, Bonnie's very happy
at Axe Capital.

50:01.470 --> 50:03.011
We're taking
great care of her.

50:03.095 --> 50:05.220
And she's staying.

50:08.720 --> 50:11.679
I guess I was wrong about you-
I thought you were smart.

50:13.136 --> 50:16.470
The elevator is that way.

50:26.178 --> 50:28.470
Bensinger's not
going our way.

50:28.553 --> 50:30.512
We lost this one.

50:30.595 --> 50:31.804
Against Axe
and Rebecca.

50:31.887 --> 50:34.053
Bensinger's backing them.

50:38.512 --> 50:39.845
Okay.

50:39.929 --> 50:41.929
This means
our data's come in:

50:42.011 --> 50:43.720
Axe is that emotionally
committed to Rebecca.

50:43.804 --> 50:45.679
Especially so if
I'm coming after her.

50:45.762 --> 50:48.220
Is that a stopper?

50:48.303 --> 50:51.095
The opposite.
A structural weakness.

50:51.178 --> 50:52.720
This means
if I push hard enough

50:52.804 --> 50:55.595
it all collapses
on both of them.

50:55.679 --> 50:58.178
And Bensinger,
we just quietly retreat?

51:01.220 --> 51:04.303
Nope. He just added himself
to my fucking list.

51:04.387 --> 51:07.303
dramatic music

51:37.053 --> 51:40.470
Part of me still roots for you,
Bryan, you know that?

51:40.553 --> 51:42.387
Oh, yeah?
Which part's that?

51:42.470 --> 51:44.595
The part that remembers
an idealistic young man

51:44.679 --> 51:46.470
walking into
my office,

51:46.553 --> 51:49.011
asking for a chance
to chase the bad guys.

51:49.095 --> 51:50.303
Whaddaya think happened
to change him?

51:50.387 --> 51:52.095
Better question: who?

51:52.178 --> 51:54.679
Oh, you're gonna say it was me
did that to you.

51:54.762 --> 51:58.261
But we both know that no man can
change the nature of another.

51:58.345 --> 52:01.845
No. You went dark because good
was just too fucking hard.

52:01.929 --> 52:04.345
But you're not really dark
either, are you?

52:04.428 --> 52:06.387
No. It's like back during
Project Mercury,

52:06.470 --> 52:08.470
you either had the right stuff
or you didn't.

52:08.553 --> 52:09.720
And I don't see
any wings on you-

52:09.804 --> 52:12.053
Enough. Look.

52:12.136 --> 52:13.929
You won
this fucking round.

52:14.011 --> 52:15.929
Move that shit train

52:16.011 --> 52:17.845
and Jock will let
your father's people go.

52:17.929 --> 52:20.470
But that's where we were-

52:20.553 --> 52:23.220
before the rain of frogs
and the river running red.

52:23.303 --> 52:26.303
You want more.

52:26.387 --> 52:28.595
You want us to clear things up
with the med board.

52:28.679 --> 52:30.220
Med board?

52:30.303 --> 52:31.637
I know you went to see
that doctor in jail.

52:31.720 --> 52:34.845
I know why. And I know
you wanted me to know.

52:34.929 --> 52:36.970
It's what you really need.
And to get it you'll have to-

52:37.053 --> 52:39.845
Oooh, I did teach you how to
make a deal. Didn't I?

52:39.929 --> 52:41.178
Better than you think.

52:41.261 --> 52:43.178
Because the deal requires
you also walk away

52:43.261 --> 52:44.637
from the voting nonsense.

52:44.720 --> 52:46.303
Blockchain.
Your pilot program.

52:46.387 --> 52:50.595
So that's what
Jock needs.

52:50.679 --> 52:54.679
Of all I could do for him,
that's what matters most?

52:54.762 --> 52:57.136
I tried to convince the man
to have you owe him one.

52:57.220 --> 52:59.220
Classic Rhoades:
lord one over 'im

52:59.303 --> 53:00.303
and hold out for
something bigger.

53:00.387 --> 53:03.637
But, uh, he wants to
be paid up front.

53:03.720 --> 53:06.637
Yeah.
That shit train is powerful.

53:06.720 --> 53:09.261
No. I move it
and you give me both.

53:09.345 --> 53:12.428
Uh uh. You need two things,
you give two things.

53:12.512 --> 53:14.553
No mobile voting.

53:14.637 --> 53:17.303
These are the terms:
Your dad gets taken care of.

53:17.387 --> 53:19.303
Wendy
gets taken care of.

53:19.387 --> 53:20.345
Jock
gets taken care of.

53:20.428 --> 53:23.303
Everyone gets something.
Except me.

53:23.387 --> 53:26.762
So really that's
one more thing for you.

53:26.845 --> 53:29.637
Do we have a deal?

53:29.720 --> 53:32.553
I'll give you
your answer now.

53:32.637 --> 53:33.637
No.

53:35.095 --> 53:37.970
Not even you
can be this petty,

53:38.053 --> 53:39.512
that you'll let
your wife suffer just-

53:39.595 --> 53:42.845
Some things are even more
important than marriage.

53:42.929 --> 53:45.387
Like fair
and free elections?

53:45.470 --> 53:46.887
Bullshit!

53:46.970 --> 53:48.553
I know you too well
to buy that from you.

53:48.637 --> 53:51.679
Well, when you figure
that out-why this matters-

53:51.762 --> 53:53.679
maybe you'll become
an ally.

53:53.762 --> 53:55.220
Or
a worthy opponent.

53:55.303 --> 53:57.303
Or maybe you'll finally
be fully corrupt.

53:57.387 --> 54:01.637
But either way, the answer is
official and the answer is no.

54:04.136 --> 54:08.095
Another in a long line of
Chuck Rhoades mistakes.

54:10.261 --> 54:13.428
One step closer
to the fucking end.

54:18.220 --> 54:21.178
dramatic music

54:46.220 --> 54:49.261
You fucking played me.

54:49.345 --> 54:52.261
You're in the fund
and I'm out.

54:52.345 --> 54:54.345
That's the only reason
we had our tomahawk date.

54:54.428 --> 54:57.387
Not the only reason.

54:58.970 --> 55:00.303
Not even the biggest one.

55:06.595 --> 55:08.053
Funkadelic's
"Funky Dollar Bill"

55:08.136 --> 55:11.428
Funky dollar bill

55:11.512 --> 55:14.428
U.S. dollar bill

55:14.512 --> 55:17.011
Funky dollar bill

55:17.095 --> 55:20.762
U.S. dollar bill

55:20.845 --> 55:23.679
You go to school
to learn the rules

55:23.762 --> 55:28.512
On how to love
and life your life

55:40.220 --> 55:43.053
The Medical Board...

55:43.136 --> 55:45.428
I'm afraid it's a no-go.

55:50.720 --> 55:52.220
I'm sorry, Wend.

55:52.303 --> 55:54.011
You're gonna have to
take your chances with them.

55:57.512 --> 56:02.011
I asked you to go out
and kill, and-

56:02.095 --> 56:03.845
I couldn't.

56:03.929 --> 56:07.261
UFO's "Doctor Doctor"

56:07.345 --> 56:08.970
I just didn't
have the pull.

56:21.053 --> 56:24.011
Then I know
it couldn't be done.

56:44.345 --> 56:46.261
I don't usually
work this late.

56:46.345 --> 56:47.887
And I don't
take walk-ins-

56:50.136 --> 56:52.845
I don't have
the right stuff...

56:54.929 --> 56:56.053
Re-make me.

56:57.887 --> 57:01.095
Doctor, doctor, please

57:01.178 --> 57:04.804
Oh, the mess I'm in

57:04.887 --> 57:08.261
Doctor, doctor, please

57:08.345 --> 57:11.679
Oh, the mess I'm in

57:11.762 --> 57:14.345
She walked up to me

57:14.428 --> 57:18.679
And really stole my heart

57:18.762 --> 57:21.303
And then she started

57:21.387 --> 57:25.345
To take my body apart

57:25.428 --> 57:31.553
Livin', lovin', I'm on
the run far away from you

57:31.637 --> 57:35.470
Livin', lovin',
I'm on the run
