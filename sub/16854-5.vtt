00:00.137 --> 00:02.174
Previously on
"Childrens Hospital"...

00:02.405 --> 00:03.590
Guys!

00:03.973 --> 00:05.079
The power is out.

00:05.114 --> 00:07.024
This is where
the backup generator is,

00:07.059 --> 00:09.511
but that's where
most of the velociraptors are.

00:09.546 --> 00:11.782
This will teach us
to play God.

00:14.652 --> 00:19.260
5.05 - Imaginary Friends

00:19.396 --> 00:22.630
So I was like, "Lady, if you think
that Horse AIDS isn't contagious,

00:22.665 --> 00:24.493
you got another think coming...
Horse AIDS!"

00:24.561 --> 00:26.671
That's what I said to her!

00:26.706 --> 00:28.885
All right, guys, I got to go
do some computer stuff

00:28.920 --> 00:30.670
in another room,
but I'll see you later, all right?

00:30.705 --> 00:31.911
Okay.

00:31.946 --> 00:33.502
I love her stories
about horse AIDS.

00:33.536 --> 00:36.182
Oh, yeah. She's gonna
make a great mom someday.

00:37.774 --> 00:38.841
Yeah.

00:38.875 --> 00:41.068
I would make a great mom
one day.

00:41.527 --> 00:43.109
This doesn't look too serious.

00:43.246 --> 00:45.080
I'll just need to have a talk
with your parents.

00:45.114 --> 00:46.382
They're not with us anymore.

00:46.449 --> 00:47.383
I wouldn't want
to sit in a hospital

00:47.485 --> 00:49.127
waiting around for some kid,
neither.

00:49.162 --> 00:50.743
No, they passed away.

00:50.778 --> 00:51.987
- Oh!
- It was a long time ago.

00:52.021 --> 00:54.256
Well, it must be kind
of cool to be alone, huh?

00:54.291 --> 00:57.058
You get to stay up late,
watch the Johnny Carson?

00:57.093 --> 00:58.059
I'm not alone.

00:58.127 --> 01:00.162
Jasper-Pants is here
in that chair.

01:00.197 --> 01:01.663
He's invisible.

01:01.698 --> 01:03.766
You have
an imaginary friend, huh?

01:03.800 --> 01:04.800
Yeah.

01:04.867 --> 01:06.067
Okay.

01:06.135 --> 01:09.838
Since he's here, why don't we
take a look at Jasper-Pants, as well?

01:09.873 --> 01:11.290
Kid, we have a special ward

01:11.363 --> 01:13.580
where we bring imaginary friends
to make sure they're okay.

01:13.710 --> 01:15.711
We're taking him
to the imaginary-friend ward,

01:15.745 --> 01:17.546
which is totally a real thing.

01:17.614 --> 01:18.914
Uh...

01:18.948 --> 01:20.296
Attention hospital staff...

01:20.331 --> 01:22.984
Tonight is your night.
Believe in yourself.

01:23.019 --> 01:25.501
Go out there and get her back.

01:25.622 --> 01:28.030
Thank God
kids are stupid enough

01:28.065 --> 01:29.858
to have imaginary friends,
huh, guys?

01:29.893 --> 01:30.726
Yeah.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.026
Yeah. And I've been jonesing
all day for a Cigarillo.

01:33.163 --> 01:35.664
Whoa!
The 'Rillos are hard to find.

01:35.698 --> 01:36.865
Where'd you get that, man?

01:36.933 --> 01:38.033
I know a guy.

01:38.067 --> 01:38.934
Japanese guy.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.068
You say Japanese?

01:40.102 --> 01:41.495
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.672
Hi, buddy!
Look at him!

01:43.706 --> 01:45.908
Oh, dear. Oh.
Mnh-mnh. Not good.

01:45.942 --> 01:47.008
What? What is it?

01:47.043 --> 01:49.545
It looks like your baby
is suffering from No-adoption-itis.

01:49.579 --> 01:50.612
That's not even a real thing.

01:50.647 --> 01:51.947
Yes, it's a very real thing.

01:51.981 --> 01:53.249
You're gonna have
to put him up for adoption.

01:53.383 --> 01:54.115
What?

01:54.150 --> 01:56.084
We recommend
that you give him to me.

01:56.118 --> 01:58.504
Now, before you say no,
consider this...

01:58.539 --> 02:00.121
I really want a baby.

02:00.156 --> 02:01.389
Are you crazy?

02:01.424 --> 02:03.391
Am I crazy? Huh?

02:03.426 --> 02:05.461
You know what, lady?
Yeah.

02:05.495 --> 02:08.497
If wanting a baby more than
anything in the world because...

02:08.531 --> 02:11.600
a co-worker offhandedly made
a remark that you'd be a great mom

02:11.634 --> 02:14.570
after I told a story about
Horse AIDS makes me crazy,

02:14.604 --> 02:17.038
then lock me up.
I'm crazy.

02:17.073 --> 02:19.640
Sure, I've never considered
being a mom up until this morning,

02:19.675 --> 02:22.543
but now it's one of the top five things
that I think about,

02:22.578 --> 02:24.179
number one being fracking.

02:24.213 --> 02:26.830
Okay. Can you just tell me
if my baby's okay

02:26.835 --> 02:28.278
so I can get out of here?

02:28.685 --> 02:30.987
Your baby has Horse AIDS.

02:32.088 --> 02:34.028
I had an imaginary friend
when I was young.

02:34.063 --> 02:36.280
His name was Steve Perry,
and he always said,

02:36.315 --> 02:37.893
"Don't stop believing, Glenn."

02:37.927 --> 02:40.028
Steve Perry was lead singer
of Journey.

02:40.062 --> 02:42.030
He said "Don't stop believing"
to everybody.

02:42.064 --> 02:44.199
Yeah, but I imagined
that he was my best friend

02:44.233 --> 02:46.735
and, with me, he always added
"Glenn."

02:46.769 --> 02:48.737
Chief was my imaginary
best friend.

02:48.771 --> 02:49.771
Yeah, that's right.

02:49.839 --> 02:51.533
Well, I had a bunch
of imaginary friends,

02:51.570 --> 02:53.791
only they were real friends
because I wasn't a loser.

02:53.910 --> 02:56.144
- Hey.
- Okay, listen up, everybody.

02:56.212 --> 02:58.732
I'm so sorry to tell you this,
but we're going to shut down

02:58.782 --> 03:00.649
this kind of makeshift smoking
hangout lounge.

03:00.683 --> 03:01.688
What?!

03:01.717 --> 03:02.951
- Fascist!
- Fonzie!

03:02.986 --> 03:05.501
Because...
we're going to make it

03:05.536 --> 03:09.992
into the official very comfortable
smoking lounge.

03:10.059 --> 03:10.859
Great!

03:10.894 --> 03:13.061
- Capitalist!
- Love it.

03:13.095 --> 03:15.196
Hey, I just read the news
on the Internet.

03:15.231 --> 03:17.032
They're shutting this place down?

03:17.066 --> 03:20.936
Yep, Sy finally realized
the importance of smoking comfortably.

03:21.004 --> 03:24.168
Great.
Well, hooray for that news.

03:24.173 --> 03:26.675
Owen, my boy, you're back!

03:30.747 --> 03:33.615
Did you bring the steth-poop-a-scope
I asked for?

03:33.650 --> 03:34.683
Ho ho ho!

03:34.717 --> 03:37.118
Here you go, Dr. Santa Claus.

03:37.153 --> 03:39.821
Look, Dr. Santa Claus,
I can't help you anymore.

03:39.856 --> 03:41.790
They're shutting this place down.

03:41.824 --> 03:43.892
Where's everybody
going to go?

03:43.960 --> 03:45.126
They need help!

03:45.161 --> 03:47.829
Raggedy Paggedy
broke her smile!

03:47.864 --> 03:50.566
Big-Ben-Burger's
covered in ouchies!

03:50.600 --> 03:53.869
Captain Beach-House's
blood pressure is 60 over 40.

03:53.903 --> 03:55.637
It's hard enough as it is.

03:55.672 --> 03:57.639
I'm the only doctor in the ward.

03:57.674 --> 04:00.162
None of "aar" kids had
the "faar" sight

04:00.197 --> 04:02.578
to "staart" our names
with "daarctor."

04:02.612 --> 04:03.912
Only you did it, Owen,

04:03.947 --> 04:06.247
because you're such
a smart little boy.

04:06.282 --> 04:08.951
But I'm not a boy anymore,
Dr. Santa Claus.

04:08.985 --> 04:10.018
Don't you get it?

04:10.053 --> 04:12.621
That's only true
if you decide it is.

04:12.655 --> 04:14.590
All right. All right.

04:14.624 --> 04:15.724
I'll tell you what.

04:15.758 --> 04:18.793
I'll help you cure these guys,
but that's all I can do.

04:18.827 --> 04:21.394
Oh, thank you, Owen!
Okay!

04:22.406 --> 04:23.754
Attention hospital staff...

04:23.789 --> 04:26.802
if you just be quiet for 30 seconds,
I can finish up.

04:26.836 --> 04:29.205
Then we can both go to sleep.
That is all.

04:29.939 --> 04:31.640
Is that it?
Can I go now?

04:31.708 --> 04:33.742
So impatient.
Hold your Horse AIDS.

04:33.776 --> 04:37.646
You know, your baby might be happier
with a more patient mother.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.014
Is this an adoption form?

04:39.048 --> 04:41.049
No, it's a standard medical form.

04:41.084 --> 04:42.851
Can't you read
the removable sticker?

04:42.885 --> 04:44.052
- What?
- Sign it.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.453
I'll look into that
after the holidays.

04:45.525 --> 04:46.546
I'm not signing this.

04:46.656 --> 04:49.224
God, you're act like I'm trying
to steal your baby or something.

04:50.460 --> 04:51.801
Now, you have to hold still

04:51.828 --> 04:54.059
so I can get a blood sample,
Drunk Daddy.

04:54.130 --> 04:57.065
You know daddy loves mommy,
right, honey?

04:58.167 --> 04:59.968
Damn it!

05:00.003 --> 05:01.703
This guy doesn't even have blood.

05:01.738 --> 05:03.639
It's all glitter
and shaving cream.

05:03.673 --> 05:05.641
Well, BeanBag Boy should be
an easy one.

05:05.675 --> 05:07.142
He's full of beans.

05:07.176 --> 05:08.644
Ohh.

05:08.711 --> 05:10.912
BeanBag Boy has gas?

05:10.947 --> 05:11.980
What am I doing?

05:12.015 --> 05:13.081
You're helping!

05:13.116 --> 05:14.750
Now there's just two left...

05:14.784 --> 05:17.085
Jasper-Pants
and Captain Beach-House.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.319
What's, uh...

05:18.387 --> 05:19.695
going on in here, Owen?

05:20.322 --> 05:21.690
Oh.

05:21.724 --> 05:23.692
I just came in here to smoke.

05:23.726 --> 05:26.227
Owen! Captain Beach-House
is flatlining!

05:26.762 --> 05:30.065
You don't still believe
in imaginary friends, do you, Owen?

05:30.099 --> 05:32.501
Get me 20 cc
of chocolate frosting, stat!

05:32.536 --> 05:34.503
Shut up, Dr. Santa Claus!

05:34.538 --> 05:36.705
Who are you talking to?

05:36.739 --> 05:38.140
I was talking to Val.

05:38.175 --> 05:41.510
I called her Dr. Santa Claus
because she's so fat.

05:41.878 --> 05:43.945
Burn.

05:43.980 --> 05:45.013
You are fat.

05:45.048 --> 05:46.848
His blood pump stopped!

05:46.883 --> 05:49.107
I'm just gonna sit down
right over here

05:49.142 --> 05:51.914
while you guys
continue to ask me questions.

05:52.189 --> 05:55.123
Ohh! Me "haartee"!

05:55.191 --> 05:57.625
We need to sedate him.
Hand me those jelly beans.

05:57.660 --> 06:00.239
Owen, do you think
there's someone in that bed?

06:01.297 --> 06:02.363
Of course not!

06:02.398 --> 06:04.566
Well, then,
if there's no one there,

06:04.634 --> 06:06.935
you wouldn't be mad if I did...

06:06.969 --> 06:08.704
No. No, no, no.

06:08.738 --> 06:09.771
No, please don't.

06:09.806 --> 06:10.906
This!

06:10.940 --> 06:12.174
Aah! Me "haaaart"!

06:12.208 --> 06:13.641
We're losing him, Owen!

06:15.845 --> 06:16.912
Screw it!

06:16.946 --> 06:19.247
Don't you die on me,
Captain Beach-House!

06:19.281 --> 06:20.381
Don't you die on me!

06:20.416 --> 06:22.383
This is awesome!

06:22.418 --> 06:23.918
Hey, watch this.

06:25.922 --> 06:27.856
Glenn, no!
They're real!

06:27.890 --> 06:29.600
I can even use
a bow and arrow, right?

06:36.065 --> 06:37.733
No! Not the arrows!

06:37.767 --> 06:39.234
Guys, please don't do this!

06:39.301 --> 06:40.401
You're hurting them!

06:40.436 --> 06:41.906
Whoo!

06:42.071 --> 06:43.171
How about nunchuks?!

06:43.206 --> 06:45.207
Chk chk!

06:45.241 --> 06:47.175
Hyah!

06:47.210 --> 06:49.144
Aaaaah!

06:49.178 --> 06:50.923
Glenn!

06:52.649 --> 06:55.283
Why did you stop believing,
Glenn?

06:55.351 --> 06:58.120
I told you over and over again,

06:58.154 --> 06:59.788
personally.

06:59.822 --> 07:02.724
I even added Glenn to it
and everything.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.410
Oh, Steve...

07:04.794 --> 07:06.294
Glenn!

07:06.328 --> 07:07.829
Glenn, who are you talking to?

07:07.897 --> 07:10.732
You lost your innocence, Glenn.

07:10.767 --> 07:13.101
Why must you rob Owen of his?

07:13.136 --> 07:16.004
I'm sorry,
imaginary Steve Perry.

07:16.539 --> 07:18.106
I'm just gonna...

07:18.141 --> 07:19.107
I'm getting out.

07:19.142 --> 07:21.076
And I'm sorry, real Owen.

07:21.110 --> 07:22.043
Thanks, buddy!

07:22.111 --> 07:23.078
How can I help?

07:23.112 --> 07:25.247
Grab a schmeg-poop-a-mometer
and go to work!

07:25.281 --> 07:26.314
You got it!

07:26.348 --> 07:28.031
No need!

07:30.787 --> 07:32.612
Wait.

07:34.757 --> 07:35.891
What happened?

07:35.925 --> 07:37.192
It was Glenn.

07:37.260 --> 07:39.861
That's the power of believing,
Owen!

07:39.896 --> 07:41.296
It's contagious!

07:41.330 --> 07:44.800
It goes on and on
and on and on!

07:44.834 --> 07:46.968
Like that stupid song
you sing.

07:47.003 --> 07:48.436
Jasper-Pants!

07:48.470 --> 07:50.238
Don't worry about me, Dylan.

07:50.273 --> 07:52.307
I'm only dying.
It's no big whoop.

07:52.374 --> 07:54.509
What about
the power of believing?

07:54.576 --> 07:56.244
You don't believe anymore.

07:56.279 --> 07:57.913
You've lost your innocence.

07:57.947 --> 07:59.981
I have had
to grow up pretty fast.

08:00.049 --> 08:00.982
My parents died.

08:01.017 --> 08:01.716
Ah.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.885
I also found this stack of Playboys
in the woods last week,

08:03.920 --> 08:06.321
which made a big impression
on me.

08:06.355 --> 08:08.890
Well, goodbye, Jasper-Pants.

08:08.958 --> 08:10.091
And thanks.

08:10.126 --> 08:12.894
I love you.

08:17.466 --> 08:21.402
Dr. Santa Claus,
I also really enjoy Playboys.

08:21.437 --> 08:25.273
So... maybe it's time
we say goodbye.

08:25.308 --> 08:26.908
Thanks for everything.

08:26.943 --> 08:30.011
So, you can probably go die
or whatever, too.

08:30.046 --> 08:32.881
I understand.

08:32.914 --> 08:36.386
But I think I still have
some usefulness in me.

08:36.552 --> 08:40.322
Dylan, I will be
your new imaginary friend.

08:40.356 --> 08:42.357
Oh. Um...

08:42.390 --> 08:43.705
But I just went through
the whole thing

08:43.740 --> 08:46.094
about growing up too fast
and the Playboys...

08:46.162 --> 08:47.795
Ho ho ho ho!

08:47.830 --> 08:49.231
Don't worry! It'll be great.

08:49.265 --> 08:51.562
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

08:52.135 --> 08:53.749
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

08:53.836 --> 08:56.071
Oh, fine.

09:11.287 --> 09:15.390
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

09:15.424 --> 09:17.425
Look, I...

09:17.493 --> 09:19.277
Can you stop laughing
for a second

09:19.312 --> 09:21.874
so I can have a conversation?

09:22.899 --> 09:24.099
Thank you.

09:24.133 --> 09:25.800
Thanks.

09:25.868 --> 09:27.969
Come on.

09:28.004 --> 09:29.871
Hey, guys,
I'm gonna head home early.

09:29.906 --> 09:31.206
I got a case
of No-adoption-itis.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.208
You looking
to adopt a child, Cat?

09:33.242 --> 09:35.377
Yeah. Why?
You know of one?

09:35.411 --> 09:39.249
Well, I think I know
where you can find one.

09:39.381 --> 09:40.886
Where?

09:40.921 --> 09:42.850
Same guy who got me
the Cigarillos.

09:42.885 --> 09:44.386
He lives about a mile
and a half that way.

09:44.453 --> 09:45.761
- Okay.
- Japanese guy.

09:45.812 --> 09:47.032
Oh! Okay, cool.

09:47.123 --> 09:48.938
I thought you were talking about
the orphan kid over there,

09:48.992 --> 09:52.327
who was talking to himself
and I was like, "No way!"

09:52.361 --> 09:54.078
Come on, Dr. Santa Claus.
