staring at me like that,
I ain't coming to New York.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.700

- You have lost faith in me...

04:47.655 --> 04:50.391
Master.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.793
I do not deserve

04:52.826 --> 04:56.130
your mercy, nor will I
ask for it.

04:56.164 --> 04:59.400
I only ask
that you take my life.

- Well, then.

05:03.837 --> 05:07.141
This is a proud day...

05:07.175 --> 05:10.344
for Abraham Setrakian.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.048
This is Standartenfuhrer

05:14.082 --> 05:16.017
Thomas Eichhorst,
defeated by a Jew.

05:18.019 --> 05:19.988
My most trusted acolyte,

05:20.021 --> 05:21.822
an officer of the Reich,

05:21.855 --> 05:24.425
bested by a pawnbroker.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.430
You will go down

05:29.463 --> 05:32.233
in the history of our species

05:32.266 --> 05:34.502
as an abject defeatist

05:34.535 --> 05:36.337
who lost his stomach
for the fight!

05:36.370 --> 05:39.340
Is that what you
really desire, Thomas?

05:39.373 --> 05:43.077
To hand victory to Setrakian?

05:43.111 --> 05:45.013
- No!
- Then find him!

05:45.046 --> 05:47.248
Find the Born and the others.

05:47.281 --> 05:49.950
Above all, do not

05:49.984 --> 05:52.286
let that warhead
cross the river!

05:56.957 --> 05:59.994
- You have my word.

06:05.233 --> 06:07.235
- Right where you left it.

06:16.244 --> 06:19.613
- The hat. The cane. You're
almost back to your old self.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.615
- Very old self.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.617
There's an age, Miss Velders,

06:23.651 --> 06:26.720
where you meet an enemy
you cannot run from.

06:26.754 --> 06:30.058
Time. When you reach it,

06:30.091 --> 06:32.060
you experience
your body's betrayal

06:32.093 --> 06:34.262
from within.

06:36.764 --> 06:39.267
Now, the Lumen.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.639
(ambient music)

06:45.673 --> 06:48.008
- Down here, come on!

06:51.011 --> 06:53.514
- It's up here.

07:00.688 --> 07:03.023
(heavy breathing)

07:03.057 --> 07:05.359
Maybe you should

07:05.393 --> 07:09.097
stay down here. Keep a lookout.

07:09.130 --> 07:11.865
I'll be back in two shakes.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.139
(heavy breathing)

07:26.980 --> 07:29.983
- Ah!

07:34.655 --> 07:36.624
Ah... ah...

07:36.657 --> 07:38.659
Ah!

07:44.498 --> 07:48.302
- Professor? Professor?

07:48.336 --> 07:51.071
- Is it safe?

07:51.105 --> 07:52.973
- It hasn't been touched.
Are you all right?

07:53.006 --> 07:54.908
- We'd best be sure.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.744
- I'm worried about you,
are you OK?

07:56.777 --> 07:59.513
- I'm fine! Open the case!

08:14.862 --> 08:17.131
- You did well.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.204
- We should... find
somewhere new to hold up.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.081
- Do you really think
the Master has Zack?

08:34.114 --> 08:36.083
- I don't know. Maybe he's using
Zack as bait. It doesn't change

08:36.116 --> 08:38.085
our plan.
- No? If it were my son--

08:38.118 --> 08:40.154
- Well, luckily, you don't
need to make that decision.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.959
- That was a dick move
even for you.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.529
- I didn't mean it that way.
Look, I...

08:48.562 --> 08:51.265
I'm just doing the only thing
I know to do.

08:51.299 --> 08:53.867
If we can find Setrakian,
if we can kill the Master,

08:53.901 --> 08:55.869
then all of this ends:

08:55.903 --> 08:57.871
the depravation, the feed lots,

08:57.905 --> 09:00.208
the blood harvesting, all of it.

09:00.241 --> 09:03.311
- And this Setrakian
will have a plan?

09:03.344 --> 09:05.713
- Setrakian always has a plan.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.748
Whether it'll work
is another question.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.105
- Well, I hope you like maple...

09:34.007 --> 09:35.276
What the hell are you doing?

09:39.947 --> 09:42.216
Professor...

09:44.117 --> 09:46.320
- I saw this in a dream.

09:46.354 --> 09:49.089
The ouroboros. The Egyptians

09:49.122 --> 09:51.091
thought it represented
the never-ending

09:51.124 --> 09:53.093
cycle of creation

09:53.126 --> 09:56.163
and destruction,
birth and death.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.866
...Eternity!

09:58.899 --> 10:00.868
- Right.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.936
But why...

10:02.970 --> 10:06.274
But why are you ripping out the
pages after all we went through?

10:06.307 --> 10:09.610
- I have to see the parts
and their sum all at once.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.612
There are... there are
patterns here. Connections.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.781
I... things I...

10:13.814 --> 10:15.783
I've overlooked.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.852
- I... I thought you
had this figured out.

10:18.886 --> 10:22.022
The "Face of God," the...
the nuclear explosion.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.057
- I was wrong.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.226
Slightly.

10:26.260 --> 10:28.462
I missed the significance
of these images.

10:28.496 --> 10:31.632
- All right. OK, hold on, hold on.
- I can't hold on!

10:31.665 --> 10:34.468
There's too much to do!
- Just take a minute.

10:34.502 --> 10:37.004
- I...I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME!
(distorted echoing)

10:40.073 --> 10:42.142
- Professor? You OK?

10:42.175 --> 10:44.412
Professor? Professor!

10:44.445 --> 10:48.115
Professor! Professor?!

10:57.691 --> 11:00.328
- You see we did our third
induction this week.

11:00.361 --> 11:02.262
Another two probably
by the end of the month.

11:02.296 --> 11:04.432
That suggestion you had

11:04.465 --> 11:07.668
about harvesting early.
It... it's really paying off.

11:07.701 --> 11:10.338
- That is because you
made it pay off, Mr. Desai.

11:10.371 --> 11:12.406
I'm very impressed

11:12.440 --> 11:14.408
by the turnaround.

11:14.442 --> 11:17.177
- Well, coming
from you, sir, that...

11:17.210 --> 11:19.347
that means a lot.
- In fact, you have done

11:19.380 --> 11:22.015
so well, I have decided
to promote you.

11:22.049 --> 11:25.386
Please.
- Really?

11:27.388 --> 11:29.423
Whatever you need me to do.

11:29.457 --> 11:31.525
- There is a group at large
here in New York.

11:31.559 --> 11:34.294
It's of the utmost importance
they be apprehended

11:34.328 --> 11:36.530
as soon as possible.
You are familiar

11:36.564 --> 11:38.766
with two of them, Abraham
Setrakian and Dutch Velders.

11:38.799 --> 11:42.302
- It would give me great pleasure
to bring them to justice.

11:42.336 --> 11:45.539
- These other two,
Ephraim Goodweather

11:45.573 --> 11:48.308
and Vasiliy Fet,
are working with them.

11:48.342 --> 11:50.378
There is also a half- strigoi,

11:50.411 --> 11:53.046
half-human, who goes
by the name of Quinlan.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.450
- Huh. Why are they
so important?

11:56.484 --> 11:58.452
- They intend to smuggle

11:58.486 --> 12:01.589
a nuclear bomb into Manhattan.

12:10.664 --> 12:12.633
- Come on, Professor.

12:12.666 --> 12:14.668
Please don't do this.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.206
(door opening)

12:24.612 --> 12:27.114
(door closing)
(gun being cocked)

12:34.622 --> 12:38.125
(approaching footsteps)

12:40.794 --> 12:43.764
- Stop right there!

12:43.797 --> 12:47.067
- Dutch?
- Eph?

12:51.705 --> 12:53.674
- Oh, thank God!

12:53.707 --> 12:55.643
Thank God.

12:58.378 --> 13:01.281
- His heartbeat's
changing rapidly.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.116
I think he's in AFib.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.118
- What does that mean?

13:05.152 --> 13:08.288
He's had a heart attack?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.458
- Or maybe a stroke.

13:10.491 --> 13:13.126
- Jesus.
- Or hopefully he's

13:13.160 --> 13:15.463
just dehydrated.
How'd he get so run down?

13:15.496 --> 13:19.132
- We were captured. He was put in
a Partnership research facility.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.902
- What kind of research?

13:21.935 --> 13:24.872
- All I know is that they're running
experiments. - Experiments?

13:24.905 --> 13:26.874
- He's B-positive.
They were doing studies,

13:26.907 --> 13:28.976
pumping him full of drugs.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.312
- Wait, wait, wait. Hold on,
start from the beginning.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.147
- I told you, we were caught.
We were separated.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.983
- For how long?
- I don't know.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.985
Three months, maybe.
- You didn't see him

13:38.018 --> 13:41.221
for three months!? - I don't understand
your tone here. Are you blaming me?

13:41.254 --> 13:43.323
- I'm not blaming you!
- Because at least I was here!

13:43.356 --> 13:45.325
It was just me and him!
We made it on our own

13:45.358 --> 13:47.327
for months off the grid!
And, by the way,

13:47.360 --> 13:49.329
I was locked up, too,
if that's of any concern.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.331
And when I was,
he was all I thought about.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.467
And meanwhile, what were you
doing in Philadelphia?

13:56.036 --> 13:58.739
- Look, I don't think that this

13:58.772 --> 14:01.074
is getting us anywhere.
The question is,

14:01.108 --> 14:05.078
what do we do now?
- We need to get him hydrated.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.114
And we should probably get him

14:07.147 --> 14:09.282
some blood thinners. God knows
where we'll find that.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.919
- Well, I know a place.
But I don't want

14:11.952 --> 14:14.387
to leave him alone.
- I'll stay.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.894
(indistinct speaking)

14:25.666 --> 14:28.268
- We gotta check this place out.
It's an old marine warehouse

14:28.301 --> 14:30.270
in Sheepshead Bay.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.540
Jorge says it's gotta
be 10,000 square feet.

14:32.573 --> 14:35.709
The Partnership's growing
strawberries, tomatoes, spinach,

14:35.743 --> 14:38.612
all kinds of shit there.
- What do you think, Gus?

14:38.646 --> 14:41.448
- I think we should hit it
tonight. It's the best deal.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.450
- Hold on.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.786
Didn't we learn anything

stitching myself up,

27:53.272 --> 27:55.708
and Kelly and Zack
walked in on me.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.079
She attacked me.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.214
I killed her.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.520
Right in front of him.

28:07.554 --> 28:09.356
He had a...

28:09.389 --> 28:12.592
a device. A detonator.

28:12.625 --> 28:15.362
He, um...

28:15.395 --> 28:17.730
He pressed the button.

28:19.732 --> 28:22.034
- Are you saying...

28:22.068 --> 28:24.871
- He set off the bomb.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.006
The nuke that blew up
Liberty Island.

28:33.813 --> 28:36.683
- The Master took my wife.

28:38.651 --> 28:39.952
Tricked me...

28:39.986 --> 28:42.889
into leaving her alone
so he could turn her

28:42.922 --> 28:45.124
because he wanted me

28:45.157 --> 28:47.326
to live with that guilt.

28:47.360 --> 28:50.296
You've carried yours
for nine months.

28:50.329 --> 28:54.233
I've carried mine
for more than 50 years.

28:54.266 --> 28:57.336
This...

28:57.370 --> 29:00.072
is what the Master does
to those who defy him.

29:00.106 --> 29:03.009
This...

29:03.042 --> 29:05.912
is the price we pay. But...

29:05.945 --> 29:09.115
you must not allow this
to weaken your resolve.

29:10.550 --> 29:13.586
You did not put that detonator

29:13.620 --> 29:16.022
in Zack's hand. The Master did.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.691
It was he who turned your wife

29:18.725 --> 29:21.594
and used her
to warp your son's mind.

29:21.628 --> 29:23.596
Not you!

29:23.630 --> 29:26.599
You must hold tight

29:26.633 --> 29:30.069

29:41.814 --> 29:45.117
- The other bridges and tunnels,
they run right into Midtown.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.386
It's gotta be covered
in munchers.

29:47.420 --> 29:51.057

- Well, from the plane,

29:51.090 --> 29:53.960

29:53.993 --> 29:56.295
- Brooklyn Bridge it is, then.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.297
- There's gonna be
a reception committee.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.466
- Wouldn't want it
any other way.

29:59.499 --> 30:01.468
- Actually, I can think
of a number of other ways

30:01.501 --> 30:05.472
I'd rather have it.
But it is what it is,

30:05.505 --> 30:08.407

wide open for us.

- (Roman): Whatever we do,

after we bust through the road blocks.

world has been severed.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.729
That...

31:36.763 --> 31:40.066
was perhaps a bit of an
overstatement. Palmer--

31:40.099 --> 31:42.068
- Palmer was a quisling,

31:42.101 --> 31:44.336
a traitor to his own kind.

- Yes. Of course. Precisely.

I did some bad shit
you know nothing about.

33:24.036 --> 33:27.173
The professor gave me a chance
to make it right,

33:27.206 --> 33:30.442
and I didn't take it.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.945

East and West Side.

The Partnership's not been
keeping up the infrastructure.

34:15.922 --> 34:18.290
Do you think it could
be the gas mains?

34:18.324 --> 34:20.292
- It was too deliberate
for that. They were going off

34:20.326 --> 34:22.294
in a controlled sequence.
- Either way,

34:22.328 --> 34:25.564
I've a bad feeling.
We should get back soon.

34:25.597 --> 34:28.567

before they got it right.

34:30.669 --> 34:32.839
- Let's just hope
we got it right.

34:39.712 --> 34:42.214

the professor about Zack.

34:44.616 --> 34:47.053
I'm sorry for what I said
about you not being here.

34:48.855 --> 34:50.823

That... cantankerous

right from the start,

35:06.806 --> 35:09.108

I broke the Internet.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.443

of character.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.880

because he forgave you.

35:23.155 --> 35:25.124

35:25.157 --> 35:27.193
wanted to make sure
you didn't need anything?

35:27.226 --> 35:29.228
- I'm fine.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.199
- Souvenir?

35:33.232 --> 35:36.135
- It's a Romanian prayer rope.

35:36.168 --> 35:39.738
The orthodoxy call it
"the sword of the spirit."

35:39.772 --> 35:42.208

35:42.241 --> 35:44.143

35:44.176 --> 35:47.646
that can defeat the devil.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.548

I stopped praying

not enough on...

Prayer is an act of...

Reaching out

we sever that connection.

Can you hear me?

43:51.997 --> 43:53.965
I have something

43:53.999 --> 43:55.867
to say to you.

43:55.901 --> 43:57.903
(gagging)

43:59.070 --> 44:02.341
You are the hunger.

44:03.675 --> 44:06.645
The strain that feeds on us

44:06.678 --> 44:09.080
since time immemorial.

44:09.114 --> 44:11.249
But make no mistake,

44:11.283 --> 44:13.485
you're still a parasite.

44:13.519 --> 44:16.221
And we will flush you out

44:16.254 --> 44:18.557
and burn you.

44:18.590 --> 44:21.059
It will not be me.

44:21.092 --> 44:22.994
It will not be now,

44:23.028 --> 44:24.996
but it will happen.

44:25.030 --> 44:28.099
No matter how long it takes,

44:28.133 --> 44:30.168
in another face,

44:30.201 --> 44:32.438
in other eyes,

44:32.471 --> 44:35.341
you will see me...

44:35.374 --> 44:38.344
as you die.

44:38.377 --> 44:41.613
(snarling)

44:41.647 --> 44:44.182
And as for you,

44:44.215 --> 44:47.953
Herr Eichhorst...

44:47.986 --> 44:48.954
my name

44:48.987 --> 44:52.624
is Abraham Setrakian...

44:53.892 --> 44:56.362
...and you should know

44:56.395 --> 44:58.764
I'm not

44:58.797 --> 45:02.067
a number anymore.

45:03.735 --> 45:06.638
(speaking foreign language)

45:16.582 --> 45:18.417
(roars)

46:07.466 --> 46:09.468
