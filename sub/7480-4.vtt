I've got to get

in Langley, Virginia, in 1966.

03:19.092 --> 03:20.892
He met and married

03:20.960 --> 03:23.912
a Roma girl in 1947.

03:26.499 --> 03:29.968
That was when the Comescus
sought their revenge.

06:29.031 --> 06:30.365
a problem with him.
Let me guess.

06:30.449 --> 06:31.950
She can't stand
his begging, either.

06:32.001 --> 06:33.535
Actually, it's more
about the red hives

06:33.619 --> 06:36.204

inch of her smoking hot body.

not too long ago.

06:56.108 --> 06:57.776
Yeah, and after that sniff,

06:57.843 --> 07:00.028
what did he do when I put myself
in harm's way?

07:00.112 --> 07:02.347
DEEKS: You mean
leaving the area?

07:02.398 --> 07:04.032

protocol, Sam.

07:04.116 --> 07:07.118
He was saving his furry butt--
that's what he was doing.

07:07.186 --> 07:09.871
That why they retired him?

07:09.956 --> 07:11.856
Actually, the vet
that did his psych eval

07:11.908 --> 07:13.524
said he had a
nervous condition.

07:13.576 --> 07:16.244
It's kind of like

07:45.942 --> 07:47.409

07:47.493 --> 07:49.027
Her cameraman,
Steve Downey,

07:49.078 --> 07:50.779
was still rolling
when it happened.

07:50.863 --> 07:53.531
There was also a serious side
to Ms. Gomez's reporting.

07:53.582 --> 07:54.616
What kind of serious?

07:54.700 --> 07:56.034
Enough for her to receive

07:56.085 --> 07:58.253
several death threats
from Libyan nationalists.

07:58.337 --> 08:00.905
She did a series of stories
on Asad El-Libi.

08:00.973 --> 08:02.624
He was a Libyan expat
living here in L.A.

08:02.708 --> 08:05.093
When the crisis hit,
he moved back

08:05.161 --> 08:07.963
and started his own version
of "Radio Free Libya"

08:08.047 --> 08:10.265
after Gaddafi shut down
the Internet.

08:10.349 --> 08:12.350
The guy is a tech wizard.

08:12.418 --> 08:15.086
He set up a Web site
that got around the firewalls.

08:15.137 --> 08:18.106
It's become a clearing house
of intel for the rebels.

08:18.190 --> 08:19.441
No one knows
who he is

08:19.508 --> 08:21.109
or where in Libya
he broadcasts from,

08:21.193 --> 08:23.278
but he's become this...
sort of a folk hero.

08:23.362 --> 08:25.363
Well, looks like somebody
wasn't too happy

08:25.431 --> 08:28.033
that our local news station
was cheering him on.

08:28.100 --> 08:30.652
I'm still not getting
why we're involved with this.

08:30.736 --> 08:32.370
Adriana Gomez had been
in contact

08:32.438 --> 08:34.105

Intelligence officer,

08:34.155 --> 08:35.606

08:35.658 --> 08:38.243
He is the go-to guy
on Libyan affairs.

08:38.294 --> 08:40.245
He knows more about Asad El-Libi
than anyone.

08:40.296 --> 08:42.080
He and Adriana
traded phone calls.

08:42.131 --> 08:43.832
Twice the day
she was killed.

If this incident compromises

Get the shots,
grab the interview,

09:04.437 --> 09:06.321
move on to the next story.

09:06.405 --> 09:07.989
You work with her much?

09:08.074 --> 09:09.858
Every day
for the past two years.

09:09.942 --> 09:11.526
Partners.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.495
STEVE: You get pretty close
to someone when you spend

09:13.562 --> 09:14.629
that much time with them.

09:14.697 --> 09:15.980
Yes, you do.

09:16.032 --> 09:17.499
We'd get
into it a lot--

09:17.583 --> 09:19.084
differences
of opinion--

09:19.151 --> 09:21.503
but even in the middle of that,
there was...

09:21.587 --> 09:23.488
Heat?

09:25.341 --> 09:26.824
Did she feel it, too?

09:28.511 --> 09:30.011
Maybe.

09:31.464 --> 09:34.249
All right, going to need
some password help here, Eric.

09:34.316 --> 09:36.384
I'm going to have to teach
you guys the basics

09:36.452 --> 09:38.103
of encryption bypass
one of these days.

09:38.170 --> 09:41.122
That's cool. Then I can, uh,
read Kensi's diary.

09:41.190 --> 09:43.291
Oh, I already did.

09:43.359 --> 09:45.677
You do not want to go there.

09:47.113 --> 09:48.846
Did you know
about the death threats?

09:48.898 --> 09:50.315
She reported them
to the cops.

09:50.366 --> 09:53.017
Lot of good it did.

09:53.069 --> 09:55.487
Is there anything
you can think of?

09:55.538 --> 09:58.406
Um, someone Adriana
may have been talking to?

09:58.491 --> 09:59.741
A source, maybe?

09:59.825 --> 10:01.493
Yeah, she had a contact--
a Libyan expat.

10:01.544 --> 10:03.745
She met him a couple times
at some Libyan restaurant.

10:03.829 --> 10:05.246
Name?

10:05.314 --> 10:07.382
(sighs) Sorry.

10:07.466 --> 10:08.533
And the restaurant?

10:10.453 --> 10:13.538
I remember she had this
Libyan dish-- liver and raisins.

10:13.589 --> 10:15.673
Mmm.

10:15.724 --> 10:18.343
Adriana would do anything
for a good story.

10:22.214 --> 10:23.565
ERIC:
<i>Not much in her files.</i>

10:23.649 --> 10:26.317
A few research links,
typed interview notes.

10:26.385 --> 10:29.254
Looks like her main source
was Madison.

10:29.321 --> 10:31.439
We get any notes from her call
with him yesterday?

10:31.524 --> 10:33.391
Nada.

10:33.442 --> 10:35.560
May not have gotten to it yet.

10:35.611 --> 10:38.729
You didn't read Kensi's diary.

10:38.781 --> 10:40.231
Did you?

10:40.282 --> 10:42.567
Hey. Did you really?

10:42.618 --> 10:43.785
(beeping)

10:43.869 --> 10:45.420
Eric?

10:45.504 --> 10:46.788
Hello?

10:49.175 --> 10:51.176
I think you
secretly like Monty.

10:51.243 --> 10:52.910
Not a dog person.

10:52.962 --> 10:54.646
- Cats?
- Nope.

10:54.713 --> 10:56.481
What if you want
to get a pet?

10:56.549 --> 10:58.900
Not going to.

10:58.968 --> 11:00.385
Fish.

11:00.436 --> 11:02.103
Fish.

11:02.188 --> 11:04.088
Low maintenance,
don't make any noise.

11:04.140 --> 11:05.723
They even poop
in their own environment.

11:05.774 --> 11:07.925
Yeah, well, you
can't pet a fish.

11:07.977 --> 11:09.644
Exactly. And if
things don't work out...

11:09.728 --> 11:11.929
- Sushi.
- Sushi.

11:15.985 --> 11:17.452
(knocking)

11:22.324 --> 11:24.108
Commander Madison?

11:24.160 --> 11:25.994
What do you want?

11:26.078 --> 11:28.446
NCIS. Like to talk to you
about Adriana Gomez.

11:28.497 --> 11:30.798
Sorry, not a good time.

11:33.252 --> 11:35.336
All right.

11:35.421 --> 11:37.422
We're just going
to have to make a call--

11:37.473 --> 11:38.723
get a warrant.

11:38.790 --> 11:40.592
I think you know the deal.

11:41.594 --> 11:43.394
Do that.

11:52.271 --> 11:54.022
Federal agents!

12:03.032 --> 12:04.148
Any more?

12:04.200 --> 12:05.366
No.

12:06.285 --> 12:08.703
(tires squealing)

12:25.563 --> 12:27.533
They wanted to know
about Asad El-Libi,

12:27.534 --> 12:29.535
where he's operating
from, how to find him.

12:30.586 --> 12:33.505
I got the feeling they
knew more than I did.

12:33.572 --> 12:35.707
Seen them before?

12:35.774 --> 12:37.075
No.

12:37.143 --> 12:41.078
Adriana Gomez called you twice
the day she was killed.

12:41.130 --> 12:42.747
Yeah, she left me
a voice message.

12:42.798 --> 12:43.798
Said it was important.

12:43.883 --> 12:45.600
What about those stories
she did last month?

12:45.684 --> 12:48.436
I just gave her some basic
background. Nothing classified.

12:48.521 --> 12:51.222
Things everyone on Gaddafi's
side would know about anyway.

12:51.273 --> 12:53.608
But I think she was on
to something else.

12:53.692 --> 12:55.894
Asad El-Libi's real identity?

12:55.945 --> 12:57.645
That or where to find him.
And for whatever reason,

12:57.730 --> 13:00.698
they didn't want her doing any
more stories on him.

13:00.766 --> 13:03.601
I guess they suspected
I knew what she knew.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.119
If you guys hadn't
arrived when you did,

13:05.204 --> 13:07.655
it'd be my photo
you're taking, not his.

13:10.326 --> 13:11.876
NELL:
Salim Akim.

13:11.944 --> 13:13.495
He's been linked to
Gaddafi's secret police.

13:13.579 --> 13:16.280
And his partner is still
out there somewhere.

13:16.332 --> 13:17.582
ERIC:
Partners.

13:17.633 --> 13:19.501
They started out
as a quartet.

13:19.585 --> 13:22.387
NELL: Hakim Selani, Navid Mufar
and Yuseff Aman.

13:22.454 --> 13:23.922
CALLEN: The last one.
NELL: Yuseff.

13:23.973 --> 13:25.974
That's the one who escaped
from Madison's house.

13:26.041 --> 13:27.926
All four came through
LAX on tourist visas

13:27.977 --> 13:28.977
and counterfeit
passports.

13:29.061 --> 13:30.528
They vanished into
the L.A. melting pot

13:30.596 --> 13:31.846
before the Feds
could track them.

13:31.931 --> 13:33.181
It's hard to do
that without help.

13:33.265 --> 13:35.016
Maybe Yuseff and his team

13:35.100 --> 13:37.301
came here to find out where
in Libya Asad El-Libi

13:37.353 --> 13:38.319
was broadcasting from.

13:38.404 --> 13:39.437
Adriana found out where.

13:39.488 --> 13:41.022
If she goes public
with that story,

13:41.106 --> 13:43.775
Asad El-Libi relocates and
they're back to square one.

13:43.826 --> 13:45.360
The agents are probably
on their way back home

13:45.444 --> 13:46.444
to hunt him down.

13:46.495 --> 13:47.745
We have no way to warn him

13:47.813 --> 13:49.163
because we don't know
where he is.

13:49.248 --> 13:50.949
She had a source.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.867
Right. The cameraman said
he didn't have a name,

13:52.952 --> 13:55.653
but he also said that she
met him at a Libyan cafe.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.539
Can't be that many of those
in town. Eric?

13:57.623 --> 13:59.173
I'm on it.

13:59.258 --> 14:00.658
All right, Cafe Tripoli.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.126
She had lunch there three times

14:02.177 --> 14:04.328
in the past couple months,
according to her credit card records.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.831
CALLEN:
Kensi, Deeks.

14:06.882 --> 14:08.332
And Monty.

14:08.384 --> 14:10.468
Bring me back some baklava.

14:13.472 --> 14:16.140
I mean, look at him--
he's perfect for our cover.

14:16.191 --> 14:18.476
The young, hip couple
wanting a taste

14:18.527 --> 14:21.012
of exotic Middle Eastern cuisine
and our rescue dog.

14:21.063 --> 14:22.697
It's actually a requirement

14:22.781 --> 14:25.617
for all young hip couples in
Los Angeles to have rescue dogs.

14:25.684 --> 14:27.690
There's only one hitch in your
little plan there, buddy.

14:27.691 --> 14:29.443
Dogs aren't allowed
in restaurants.

14:29.567 --> 14:31.014
We've considered that,
haven't we, Monty?

14:31.039 --> 14:33.239
- Have you?
- He's also a service animal.

14:34.526 --> 14:36.127
They use them for blind people,

14:36.194 --> 14:37.862
people with seizures,
all sorts of things.

14:37.913 --> 14:40.331
There's even a woman
in Minnesota

14:40.382 --> 14:41.583
with an anxiety monkey.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.468
Really?

14:43.535 --> 14:45.920
Yeah, I read about it
in <i>Bark</i> magazine.

14:46.005 --> 14:50.041
Do you get that?
<i>Bark</i> magazine? No?

14:50.092 --> 14:52.293
Their motto is
"Dog is my Co-Pilot".

14:53.512 --> 14:56.814
No? Not gonna fly?

14:56.882 --> 14:58.382
All right, Monty,
you heard the woman.

14:58.434 --> 14:59.383
You're staying here.

14:59.435 --> 15:01.603
Don't give her kisses.
Aw, really?

15:01.687 --> 15:04.822
You're staying here and I'm going
to put the radio on for you.

15:04.890 --> 15:07.191
A little NPR, yeah?

15:07.242 --> 15:10.028
Loves <i>All Things Considered.</i>

15:10.079 --> 15:12.864
(over radio): Finding
a donor isn't all that hard.

15:12.915 --> 15:15.399
Finding out where to bike
to get the best meal is.

15:15.451 --> 15:19.587
As NPR's Joe Palca explains,
scientists think they--

15:19.672 --> 15:22.423
(distorted male voice
speaking Arabic)

15:30.966 --> 15:32.133
Welcome.

15:32.217 --> 15:34.052
That's Asad El-Libi.
You know of him?

15:34.103 --> 15:36.854
Yeah. Actually, one
of our friends is a reporter

15:36.922 --> 15:38.940
who did a whole bunch
of stories on him.

15:39.024 --> 15:43.061
Yeah, she's the one who
recommended this place to us.

15:43.112 --> 15:45.596
Maybe you know her--
Adriana Gomez.

15:45.648 --> 15:47.982
Oh, yes, yes,
from the local station.

15:48.067 --> 15:49.617
Yes, exactly.

15:49.702 --> 15:52.403
She usually comes in here with
a Libyan friend for lunch.

15:52.454 --> 15:54.155
My God, sweetie,

15:54.239 --> 15:56.040
what's his name?
Oh, what is his name?

15:56.108 --> 15:58.576
Libyan guy, comes...
I cannot recall.

16:01.246 --> 16:03.231
We'll go check on Monty, huh?
Sure.

16:10.973 --> 16:11.956
Not moving?

16:12.007 --> 16:13.224
Really?

16:16.011 --> 16:18.062
No.

16:18.130 --> 16:21.349
(groans) Shoot.

16:21.417 --> 16:23.601
Eric, I need you run
a plate for me.

16:23.652 --> 16:25.687
Two, S as in Slayer,
M as in Metallica,

16:25.771 --> 16:26.688
A as in Anthrax,

16:26.772 --> 16:31.659
Five, Six, Four,
P as in, uh... Parsnip.

16:31.744 --> 16:33.528
Parsnip?

16:33.612 --> 16:35.446
Your lettering system
is heavy metal bands

16:35.497 --> 16:37.865
and you're giving me a
root vegetable for "P"?

16:37.950 --> 16:39.667
I don't know, man,
I drew a blank.

16:39.752 --> 16:41.536
Pantera? Hello?

16:41.620 --> 16:43.788
Oh, <i>Cowboys From Hell.</i>

16:43.839 --> 16:45.173
What was I thinking?

16:45.257 --> 16:48.876
Car is registered
to Farag Hijazi.

16:48.961 --> 16:50.461
He's 38, Libyan ex-pat,

16:50.529 --> 16:53.131
lives about a half mile
away, off Glendon.

16:53.182 --> 16:54.582
Owns several small businesses,

16:54.650 --> 17:00.004
including a auto glass shop
that closed several months ago.

17:00.055 --> 17:03.558
Which is why a large power bill
last month makes no sense.

17:03.642 --> 17:06.010
Okay. Thanks, man.

17:06.060 --> 17:07.729
They're not talking.

17:07.813 --> 17:11.065
Poison... possessed...

17:11.150 --> 17:12.950
pentagram...
really, Deeks?

17:13.018 --> 17:14.335
Monty!

17:15.820 --> 17:19.073
CALLEN: Com's up.
We're at the auto shop, Eric.

17:37.009 --> 17:39.343
SAM:
Hijazi must've had

17:39.394 --> 17:41.679
a lot of late nighters
doing his books.

17:41.730 --> 17:43.431
No computer.

17:45.601 --> 17:47.051
There was.

17:47.102 --> 17:50.271
Ethernet, high-speed,
high capacity.

17:50.355 --> 17:54.275
Like someone was running
an on-line business.

17:54.359 --> 17:56.527
Or something bigger.

18:04.586 --> 18:06.954
He never went to Libya.

18:07.039 --> 18:08.840
Asad El-Libi's
been broadcasting

18:08.907 --> 18:10.024
here the whole time.

18:10.092 --> 18:11.909
The question is,
where is he now?

18:22.641 --> 18:25.310
Asad El-Libi uses a
remote access system,

18:25.377 --> 18:27.178
so anybody tries to
track his IP address

18:27.229 --> 18:28.596
will think it's
coming from Libya.

18:28.681 --> 18:30.231
SAM:
So he's still broadcasting?

18:30.316 --> 18:32.049
DEEKS: But something
must have spooked him.

18:32.101 --> 18:33.818
He left Hijazi's shop
in a hurry.

18:33.885 --> 18:35.720
Could this be
a re-broadcast?

18:35.771 --> 18:37.405
Negatory.

18:37.489 --> 18:39.741
Asad El-Libi only
broadcasts live.

18:39.825 --> 18:41.192
Eric, can you find him?

18:41.243 --> 18:42.527
I mean, eventually...

18:42.578 --> 18:44.579
if he's still using
remote access, but...

18:44.663 --> 18:46.280
I'll keep
working on it.

18:46.365 --> 18:48.199
Time to find Hijazi.

18:49.735 --> 18:52.120
(over radio): ...that's when
a woman is 35 or older

18:52.204 --> 18:53.671
at the time of delivery,

18:53.739 --> 18:56.073
and doctors start
mentioning statistics--

18:56.125 --> 18:58.242
statistics that show increased
risk of miscarriage...

18:58.293 --> 19:00.011
Have you ever considered that
maybe Monty just likes

19:00.078 --> 19:01.596
the sound of voices
on the radio,

19:01.680 --> 19:02.764
and it doesn't
really matter

19:02.848 --> 19:04.248
what it is
we're listening to?

19:04.299 --> 19:06.134
...monitoring and genetic testing...
Wait for it.

19:06.218 --> 19:07.802
(tuning radio)

19:07.886 --> 19:10.087
(whimpering and barking)

19:10.139 --> 19:11.389
Okay, changing it
back, buddy.

19:11.440 --> 19:12.807
Changing it back.

19:12.891 --> 19:14.859
(over radio): I used to think
I was a terrible gambler.

19:14.926 --> 19:16.277
At the slots...

19:16.362 --> 19:18.896
The therapist
explained it to me.

19:18.947 --> 19:21.474
In Monty's archetypal
canine subconscious...

19:21.567 --> 19:23.429
- Okay, stop.
- It's actually Pavlovian...

19:23.619 --> 19:24.769
No, you have to stop.

19:24.820 --> 19:28.239
This is getting
far too weird. No...

19:28.290 --> 19:30.241
DEEKS:
Here comes Hijazi.

19:49.311 --> 19:52.129
Let's go.

19:52.181 --> 19:55.733
Monty, protect the car.
Good boy.

19:56.735 --> 19:58.569
(begins
"shave and haircut" knock)

19:58.637 --> 20:00.121
(finishes knock)

20:02.658 --> 20:03.775
Yes?

20:03.826 --> 20:05.777
Hi. We need to speak
to Farag Hijazi.

20:05.844 --> 20:07.829
He's not here.

20:08.831 --> 20:10.314
Federal agents.

20:10.365 --> 20:12.316
We saw him pull up.
Want to try again?

20:12.367 --> 20:14.535
Federal agents?
DEEKS: Yeah.

20:14.620 --> 20:16.987
Why don't you spend your
time finding terrorists

20:17.039 --> 20:18.989
instead of bothering my son.

20:19.041 --> 20:20.374
We are good citizens.

20:20.459 --> 20:23.494
We pay our taxes.
We pay your salaries.

20:23.545 --> 20:26.514
We have a right not to be
harassed by Federal agents.

20:28.050 --> 20:30.768
- I guess the lecture's over.
- Yeah.

20:34.189 --> 20:35.523
(clearing throat)

20:35.607 --> 20:36.808
Afternoon.

20:36.859 --> 20:38.359
KENZI:
Did you guys get him?

20:38.444 --> 20:40.228
Yeah, we got him.

20:42.147 --> 20:44.899
Asad El-Libi was broadcasting
from your shop.

20:44.983 --> 20:47.685
No sign of forced entry.

20:47.736 --> 20:49.837
Guess you
gave him a key.

20:55.661 --> 20:58.045
You were Adriana Gomez's
source, weren't you?

20:58.130 --> 21:01.466
And now she's dead because
of what you told her.

21:01.533 --> 21:03.417
I did not kill her.

21:03.502 --> 21:04.836
Maybe the Libyans killed her

21:04.887 --> 21:06.921
because they couldn't
get to you, Hijazi.

21:07.005 --> 21:08.422
They couldn't get to you yet.

21:08.507 --> 21:10.892
I told her nothing.

21:12.261 --> 21:14.428
We can protect you.

21:14.513 --> 21:16.430
You just tell us
what you told her,

21:16.515 --> 21:18.933
help us find the guys before
they find Asad El-Libi.

21:19.017 --> 21:22.236
It's your only option.
We're trying to help you.

21:22.321 --> 21:24.906
You think he's playing us?

21:24.990 --> 21:26.858
If he is, he's
a good actor.

21:26.909 --> 21:28.442
CALLEN: I want you to think
about it, Hijazi.

21:28.527 --> 21:29.944
Because if you're not
telling the truth

21:30.028 --> 21:31.162
and we can prove that...

21:31.229 --> 21:32.413
So, uh... who, exactly,

21:32.498 --> 21:35.616
do you write about
in that diary of yours?

21:35.701 --> 21:38.836
I don't have a diary.

21:42.341 --> 21:43.741
No.

21:43.792 --> 21:46.377
CALLEN: What do you say, we have a deal?
- It's a journal.

21:46.428 --> 21:48.713
SAM: I don't think
we have a deal, G.

21:48.764 --> 21:50.214
You were her source.
The Libyans killed her.

21:50.265 --> 21:51.465
Then they tried to kill

21:51.550 --> 21:53.551
the Naval Intelligence commander
she was talking to.

21:53.602 --> 21:56.521
It's only a matter of time
before they find you.

21:56.588 --> 21:58.556
All right, look, if you
don't our protection,

21:58.607 --> 21:59.757
that's fine. Just tell us

21:59.808 --> 22:01.809
where Asad El-Libi is,
so we can protect him.

22:03.862 --> 22:06.113
I wouldn't betray Asad El-Libi.

22:06.198 --> 22:08.933
The Libyans are still
here looking for him.

22:08.984 --> 22:10.618
You lie.

22:10.702 --> 22:12.653
I want to see
Asad El-Libi.

22:12.738 --> 22:15.489
You went to my shop;
you have him.

22:15.574 --> 22:18.609
Farag... he wasn't there.

22:18.660 --> 22:21.629
Neither was
his computer.

22:21.713 --> 22:22.964
We're trying to keep him safe.

22:23.048 --> 22:24.615
We're on your side.

22:24.666 --> 22:26.551
My side?

22:26.618 --> 22:29.420
First you accuse me,
then you want my help?

22:29.471 --> 22:31.472
I want a lawyer.

22:33.842 --> 22:36.126
I think we found the car
the Libyan agents used

22:36.178 --> 22:37.178
in Adriana's drive-by.

22:37.262 --> 22:39.513
Now, Steve Downey's footage

22:39.598 --> 22:42.600
didn't get enough of the car for
us to I.D. anything specific.

22:42.651 --> 22:44.018
Just that it was
a brown Impala.

22:44.102 --> 22:46.187
So checking traffic cams
in the area around the time

22:46.271 --> 22:48.856
of the shooting, we found one
with two guys who matched up

22:48.941 --> 22:50.641
to our LAX photos
of the Libyan agents.

22:50.692 --> 22:51.859
CALLEN:
Who's it registered to?

22:51.944 --> 22:53.578
It's a rental.

22:53.645 --> 22:55.980
And the address they gave for
the rental doesn't check out.

22:56.031 --> 22:58.165
Not unless they're
renting rooms

22:58.233 --> 23:00.001
at the Chuck E.
Cheese on Jefferson.

23:00.068 --> 23:01.535
All right, well,
get us whatever you can.

23:01.620 --> 23:02.670
Uh, I got a parking ticket.

23:02.754 --> 23:04.005
I'll take it.

23:04.089 --> 23:07.008
Issued this morning, 2:00 a.m.,
for parking on

23:07.092 --> 23:09.660
a residential street
without a permit after 6:00.

23:09.711 --> 23:11.712
There's no way
they'd be that careless.

23:40.125 --> 23:42.126
♪ ♪

24:07.519 --> 24:10.404
Pop the trunk.

24:21.500 --> 24:25.119
(crying quietly)

24:28.423 --> 24:31.292
It's him.

24:31.376 --> 24:34.628
My Asad El-Libi.

24:49.747 --> 24:51.765
His name was
Tarek Al-Kousa.

24:54.001 --> 24:57.737
We met a few years ago
when he came to my shop.

24:57.789 --> 25:02.042
We both loved our country,
but what could we do?

25:02.093 --> 25:04.911
It's why we were
both here.

25:04.962 --> 25:06.963
And then
the Arab Spring began.

25:09.967 --> 25:12.936
Tarek was an I.T. tech
and a programmer.

25:13.020 --> 25:15.439
When Gaddafi
shut down the Internet,

25:15.523 --> 25:17.424
he saw a way
to help the rebels.

25:17.475 --> 25:18.975
Why not do it from Libya?

25:19.060 --> 25:22.262
Tarek felt he could be more
effective from here.

25:22.313 --> 25:25.732
It was easier to hack through
the Libyan firewalls.

25:25.783 --> 25:28.068
Less chance of him
being discovered.

25:28.119 --> 25:31.455
But he made it seem like
he was in Libya, for morale.

25:31.539 --> 25:33.957
He knew the people
had to feel he was with them

25:34.041 --> 25:37.711
for them to have faith
in what he was doing.

25:37.778 --> 25:40.947
He needed a safe place.

25:40.998 --> 25:42.749
My shop was closed.

25:42.800 --> 25:48.422
Tarek insisted I stay away,
for my own protection and his.

25:48.473 --> 25:51.475
If anyone saw me
visiting my closed shop...

25:55.129 --> 25:57.630
Gaddafi has many resources.

25:57.682 --> 25:59.933
The broadcasts continued.

25:59.984 --> 26:02.185
I assumed he was
still there.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.191
You ever seen
these men before?

26:16.784 --> 26:18.585
HIJAZI:
No, I don't know these men.

26:18.652 --> 26:21.488
CALLEN: They never tried to call, they
never sent you any messages?

26:21.539 --> 26:22.839
HIJAZI:
It was too risky.

26:22.924 --> 26:24.925
You have to understand,
back in Libya,

26:24.992 --> 26:26.593
the government
monitored everything.

26:26.660 --> 26:28.011
I'm sorry, just
to clarify,

26:28.095 --> 26:31.047
what is the difference between
a journal and a diary?

26:31.132 --> 26:34.501
Diaries are for
seven-year-old girls.

26:34.552 --> 26:38.972
So, um, you would say
that a journal, then,

26:39.023 --> 26:41.691
has more adult content?

26:47.865 --> 26:49.866
Good to know.

26:51.953 --> 26:54.654
Good to know.

26:54.705 --> 26:56.072
...knew it was possible

26:56.157 --> 26:57.958
Gaddafi had
sent people here.

26:58.025 --> 27:01.878
Maybe he had
already sent them.

27:01.963 --> 27:03.880
Maybe if I had gone
to check on him...

27:03.965 --> 27:08.585
Farag, this is
not your fault.

27:08.653 --> 27:11.004
We know who did this.

27:11.055 --> 27:14.724
There's a chance
we can catch them.

27:14.809 --> 27:16.726
Now, are you sure
you're the only one

27:16.811 --> 27:18.395
that knew what he was doing?

27:18.479 --> 27:20.680
He has a sister Shari.

27:20.731 --> 27:23.900
But he would never have told her
he was still here.

27:23.985 --> 27:28.188
He wouldn't put her
in such danger.

27:28.239 --> 27:29.973
She was his only family.

27:31.993 --> 27:35.278
NELL:
Any luck with the facial recs?

27:35.363 --> 27:36.830
I'm into traffic,
ATM, security cams,

27:36.897 --> 27:40.116
anything my system can
access or hack into.

27:40.201 --> 27:42.402
Three guys in a city
of ten million.

27:42.453 --> 27:46.089
Asad El-Libi is
on-line again.

27:46.173 --> 27:48.091
What? How can that be?

27:48.159 --> 27:50.076
(distorted voice
speaking Arabic)

27:50.144 --> 27:51.428
It's live.

27:51.512 --> 27:53.463
And he's clearly
referencing events

27:53.548 --> 27:55.448
that happened after
we found his body.

27:59.971 --> 28:04.441
Hey, guys, Asad El-Libi
is broadcasting again.

28:08.229 --> 28:10.263
Either someone has taken
Asad El-Libi's place

28:10.314 --> 28:12.432
or Farag is lying to us.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.934
Maybe her brother told her
more than Farag thinks.

28:14.986 --> 28:16.036
Kensi, Deeks.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.238
And...

28:18.289 --> 28:20.040
Monty, come on!

28:21.492 --> 28:22.409
Come on!

28:22.460 --> 28:23.827
Yeah, you want
to drive?

28:23.911 --> 28:26.796
Probably better
than Kensi.

28:30.334 --> 28:33.303
(distorted voice
speaking Arabic)

28:33.387 --> 28:36.923
It's not the man,
it's what he stands for.

28:36.974 --> 28:40.126
Which means they'll come after
this guy, as well.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.512
Whoever he is.

28:42.597 --> 28:45.181
(distorted voice
speaking Arabic)

28:45.266 --> 28:48.818
I'm so proud of him,
what he did.

28:48.886 --> 28:51.821
I just...

28:51.889 --> 28:57.360
I wish I had known that he was
still here this whole time.

28:57.445 --> 29:00.163
The thought of him
being so close,

29:00.247 --> 29:02.649
and now he's gone.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.451
(sniffles)

29:04.502 --> 29:07.954
You know, your brother knew
what he was doing was dangerous.

29:08.005 --> 29:11.207
And he wanted to protect you.

29:11.292 --> 29:12.659
Yeah.

29:12.710 --> 29:14.461
(sniffles)

29:14.512 --> 29:18.682
Shari, someone has taken over
your brother's broadcasts.

29:18.766 --> 29:20.833
Can you think of anyone
that would do that?

29:20.885 --> 29:23.770
The only one he would trust

29:23.837 --> 29:27.357
to do something like this
is Farag Hajazi.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.860
Did you notice anything
out of the ordinary

29:30.945 --> 29:32.512
in the past few days?

29:32.563 --> 29:35.532
Strangers, cars,
anything you can think of?

29:35.616 --> 29:40.036
A few days ago, I thought
I was being followed.

29:40.121 --> 29:42.038
Did you see
who it was?

29:42.123 --> 29:44.741
It was a red van.

29:44.825 --> 29:48.078
And I... I kept seeing it
in the streets,

29:48.162 --> 29:50.497
in the parking lots
where I went shopping.

29:50.548 --> 29:52.031
When was the last time
you saw it?

29:52.083 --> 29:53.700
This morning.

29:54.969 --> 29:56.252
We need to go now.

29:56.337 --> 29:58.338
Please.

30:00.291 --> 30:02.875
Whoever this new Asad
El-Libi is, he's good.

30:02.927 --> 30:05.528
At least I've got a bead
on the fake IP in Libya.

30:05.596 --> 30:08.715
Yeah. He's sending out
encrypted messages.

30:08.766 --> 30:11.735
Looks like they're going out
to several of the rebel leaders.

30:11.819 --> 30:12.819
Can we read them?

30:12.886 --> 30:13.886
Not from his end.

30:13.938 --> 30:15.605
Okay, why don't you try

30:15.673 --> 30:19.576
BOTH: ...accessing the message
through the recipient's IP.

30:19.660 --> 30:21.761
If you start appearing
in my dreams,

30:21.829 --> 30:23.947
I'm going to be
really freaked out.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.750
Well, you've already
appeared in mine.

30:26.834 --> 30:28.785
Really?

30:28.869 --> 30:32.238
Only you were old.

30:32.306 --> 30:35.475
And really fat.

30:35.543 --> 30:38.294
And wearing my dress.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.647
Weird, huh?

30:40.715 --> 30:41.881
Yeah.
(computer beeps)

30:41.949 --> 30:43.883
Oh, got one.

30:43.934 --> 30:47.020
Uh, Asad El-Libi
is telling them to meet.

30:47.087 --> 30:50.256
Some kind of a summit in...

30:50.307 --> 30:53.059
Quarat as Sawadiq.

30:53.110 --> 30:56.446
Mm, small town, 50 clicks
southwest of Misrata.

30:56.514 --> 30:59.265
Uh-oh.

30:59.316 --> 31:00.567
What oh?

31:00.618 --> 31:02.485
Uh, something I saw earlier

31:02.570 --> 31:04.871
on the Naval Intelligence
updates.

31:04.938 --> 31:07.457
Gaddafi pulled a large part
of his artillery

31:07.541 --> 31:09.409
and troops away from Misrata.

31:09.460 --> 31:11.745
Which wouldn't make sense,
considering the battle

31:11.796 --> 31:14.998
for control over that city
is pivotal in the war.

31:15.082 --> 31:15.999
Unless...

31:16.083 --> 31:18.802
He knows about the rebel summit.

31:18.886 --> 31:19.803
(computer beeping)

31:19.887 --> 31:21.054
(typing)

31:21.121 --> 31:22.172
This just gets worse.

31:22.256 --> 31:23.623
I'm seeing
more encrypted messages

31:23.674 --> 31:25.958
from our new Asad El-Libi.

31:26.010 --> 31:28.511
Only, these aren't
going to the rebels.

31:28.596 --> 31:31.314
They've been sent to Gaddafi's
military command.

31:32.850 --> 31:37.570
Eric, Asad El-Libi
is setting up the rebels.

31:37.638 --> 31:39.656
How much time
do we have?

31:39.740 --> 31:41.441
Uh...

31:41.492 --> 31:44.778
The summit's scheduled for
2:00 a.m. Misrata time.

31:44.829 --> 31:48.448
We have less than two hours
to stop a massacre

31:48.499 --> 31:50.950
that could change
the course of the war.

32:01.978 --> 32:04.046
Hetty has been in contact
with the CIA,

32:04.097 --> 32:06.048
who are in turn trying
to tell the rebels.

32:06.099 --> 32:08.234
Not a lot of love lost
between those two.

32:08.318 --> 32:10.402
In addition to no coherent
command structure,

32:10.487 --> 32:12.738
the rebels are now being
forced to make a choice

32:12.822 --> 32:14.890
between the word of the CIA
and a man they believe

32:14.941 --> 32:16.091
is the voice
of the revolution.

32:16.159 --> 32:18.294
Any way to jam the broadcast,
send out a warning?

32:18.361 --> 32:19.394
The signal's
being bounced

32:19.446 --> 32:20.846
through a dozen
different countries.

32:20.914 --> 32:22.414
The only way
to do it would be

32:22.499 --> 32:24.266
from Asad El-Libi's
actual computer.

32:24.334 --> 32:25.734
Eric, check traffic cams
around Hijazi's restaurant

32:25.802 --> 32:26.869
in the last couple days.

32:26.920 --> 32:28.254
- What are we looking for?
- Red van.

32:28.338 --> 32:30.923
Shari Al-Kousa said
she'd been followed.

32:31.007 --> 32:34.326
Red vehicles,
red vehicles.

32:34.394 --> 32:36.045
Red van.

32:36.096 --> 32:37.680
There's writing
on the side.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.765
Arabic.

32:39.849 --> 32:41.183
Grocery store.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.685
Could be a Halal market.

32:42.752 --> 32:44.153
Yeah, there's lots of markets.

32:44.220 --> 32:45.721
There are...

32:45.772 --> 32:46.855
but this one's real close

32:46.923 --> 32:48.807
to where you found
Asad El-Libi's body.

32:48.892 --> 32:50.075
(computer beeping)

32:53.229 --> 32:54.647
CALLEN: Looks like you're
going shopping, Sam.

33:19.306 --> 33:21.640
(Middle Eastern music
playing over speakers)

33:23.343 --> 33:24.510
SAM:
<i>Salaam Alaykum.</i>

33:24.594 --> 33:26.895
<i>Alaykum As-salaam.</i>
How can I help?

33:26.963 --> 33:29.297
I have family coming in from
Sudan-- my father's birthday.

33:29.349 --> 33:30.683
- Oh, a feast.
- Yes.

33:30.767 --> 33:31.684
How many?

33:31.768 --> 33:34.269
25 to 30. I need lamb.

33:34.321 --> 33:35.437
CLERK:
Whole or butchered?

33:35.505 --> 33:37.356
Whole.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.358
You mind if I
select it myself?

33:39.442 --> 33:41.744
Everything we carry
is slaughtered and prepared

33:41.811 --> 33:43.478
by strict Sharia standards.

33:43.530 --> 33:45.197
I mean no
disrespect.

33:45.281 --> 33:47.082
It's a family
tradition.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.418
Superstition.

33:53.707 --> 33:55.958
Get the feeling
not everything back there

33:56.009 --> 33:58.510
is Halal.

33:59.763 --> 34:01.380
Sir, sir, sir,
where you going? Sir...

34:10.023 --> 34:12.174
Federal agent!

34:15.195 --> 34:16.895
Stop!

34:20.367 --> 34:21.367
Put down the knife.

34:36.916 --> 34:38.784
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

34:41.054 --> 34:43.005
(groans)

34:43.056 --> 34:45.139
Eric, we need an ambulance.
Now.

34:58.571 --> 35:01.023
Dead guy is Navid Mufar.

35:01.091 --> 35:03.358
Going over the calls
from his cell phone now.

35:03.410 --> 35:05.244
Running out of time here, guys.

35:05.328 --> 35:07.629
This is strange.

35:07.697 --> 35:09.415
Mufar got a ten-minute call

35:09.499 --> 35:12.584
from Hijazi's home at 3:00 p.m.

35:12.669 --> 35:14.870
We've had Hijazi
at the boat shed since 2:00.

35:14.921 --> 35:16.371
Exactly.

35:16.423 --> 35:19.458
So who was at Hijazi's house
calling Mufar?

35:22.462 --> 35:23.879
KENSI:
We need to speak

35:23.930 --> 35:25.013
with your son.

35:35.391 --> 35:37.259
Thought you'd like to know
we've had a breakthrough.

35:37.310 --> 35:38.777
Within the hour, we're
gonna know the address

35:38.862 --> 35:40.595
of where the men that
killed Tarek are staying.

35:40.647 --> 35:42.648
HIJAZI:
Thank you.

35:42.732 --> 35:44.450
His death will be avenged.

35:51.708 --> 35:54.743
(door opens, closes)

35:57.831 --> 35:59.498
(line ringing)

35:59.582 --> 36:00.615
ERIC:
He's making a call.

36:00.667 --> 36:03.168
NELL:
Come on, let it be close.

36:03.253 --> 36:04.503
ERIC:
Pasadena!

36:04.587 --> 36:07.455
NELL:
432 North Woodway.

36:07.507 --> 36:08.957
There is a problem.

36:09.008 --> 36:10.442
(man speaking Arabic over phone)

36:12.795 --> 36:14.796
(man speaking Arabic)

36:25.408 --> 36:26.358
Stop!

36:26.426 --> 36:27.809
Federal agents!

36:27.861 --> 36:29.361
Got one coming back your way!

36:34.100 --> 36:35.534
On your knees!

36:35.618 --> 36:36.835
Clear!

36:40.707 --> 36:42.324
Eric, we're good to go.

36:46.629 --> 36:48.180
ERIC: Okay, guys, but we're
gonna have to move.

36:48.264 --> 36:49.965
This summit is about to start.

36:50.016 --> 36:51.183
All right, connecting
to you now.

36:51.267 --> 36:53.185
I just got to get
into their setup.

36:53.269 --> 36:55.771
(computer beeping)

36:55.838 --> 36:56.838
You good?

36:59.976 --> 37:01.977
Getting on-line to transmit.

37:02.045 --> 37:03.061
Nell.

37:03.129 --> 37:04.062
(typing)

37:04.147 --> 37:07.065
Putting up his image.

37:07.150 --> 37:09.151
ERIC:
We are a go from Ops.

37:20.046 --> 37:24.132
(voice distorted):

37:28.154 --> 37:30.538
According to our Agency friends,

37:30.590 --> 37:32.858
most of the rebels
heard the message

37:32.926 --> 37:34.760
and were able to avoid the trap.

37:34.844 --> 37:38.647
Thanks to a
special friend

37:38.714 --> 37:40.265
who has taken
up the torch,

37:40.350 --> 37:42.017
Asad El-Libi

37:42.068 --> 37:43.986
lives on.

37:45.989 --> 37:48.690
And in special
recognition of

37:48.741 --> 37:52.611
your past contributions,
Monty, you are now

37:52.695 --> 37:57.416
an official honorary
member of our team.

37:57.500 --> 38:00.035
Good boy.

38:00.086 --> 38:02.120
SAM:
I don't believe this.

38:04.123 --> 38:05.924
Problem, Mr. Hanna?

38:06.009 --> 38:06.925
Nothing.

38:07.010 --> 38:08.093
Has Homeland
picked up

38:08.177 --> 38:10.745
Mr. Hijazi's father?

38:10.797 --> 38:12.431
Taken into custody
a couple hours ago.

38:14.217 --> 38:17.185
HETTY:
<i>Unfortunately, too many members</i>

38:17.253 --> 38:21.690
<i>of his generation</i>
<i>bought the lies of tyrants.</i>

38:23.693 --> 38:25.060
<i>The new Asad El-Libi,</i>

38:25.111 --> 38:28.447
<i>hopefully, will help</i>
<i>remedy that situation.</i>

38:41.911 --> 38:43.245
(camera beeps)

38:45.665 --> 38:48.667
(speaking Arabic)

39:20.249 --> 39:22.234
You want some?

39:24.754 --> 39:26.621
What?

39:26.673 --> 39:28.540
Do you want
some of this?

39:43.639 --> 39:47.025
CALLEN:
Hetty.

39:47.110 --> 39:49.511
I have a question.

39:49.562 --> 39:52.197
How did we get from
Romania to America?

39:54.233 --> 39:57.119
No one knows.

39:57.186 --> 40:00.906
It was two years before
I found out you were here.

40:00.990 --> 40:03.525
Too late again
to save your sister.

40:03.576 --> 40:04.859
But not you.

40:04.911 --> 40:06.712
You got me out
of the orphanage?

40:06.796 --> 40:09.247
And into every foster home.

40:09.332 --> 40:12.751
I was determined
to find you a family.

40:12.835 --> 40:16.555
You were a challenging child,
Mr. Callen.

40:18.591 --> 40:20.425
I asked the Agency

40:20.510 --> 40:22.728
to trawl the archives.

40:22.812 --> 40:26.181
It's an old friend
paying back an old favor.

40:28.484 --> 40:31.486
I wish there was more.

40:38.745 --> 40:40.412
What about my father?

40:42.899 --> 40:45.733
We never found out.
