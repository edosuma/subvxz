00:13.187 --> 00:14.579
Lovely.

00:14.666 --> 00:17.713
Yeah. Used to be a fluorescent
light bulb factory.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.932
Now it's a hazardous waste site.
There's mercury dust everywhere.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.195
- Great.
- Yeah.

00:21.282 --> 00:22.718
It's probably
not too dangerous

00:22.805 --> 00:24.763
as long as you don't,
you know, breathe.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.420
Some techs from the
hazardous materials office

00:29.507 --> 00:31.161
came in to test the air.

00:31.248 --> 00:33.903
Saw a lock on one of the
lockers, busted it open.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.513
'That's when they found it.'

00:37.385 --> 00:38.864
How long does the coroner think
he's been in there?

00:38.951 --> 00:40.214
He said with that level
of decomp

00:40.301 --> 00:41.954
at least six months.
Could be longer.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.826
Handcuffs on the wrists,
ankles.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.523
Did he have any clothes
or personal effects?

00:45.610 --> 00:49.440
This. We found it
inside his ribcage.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.355
[Lisbon]
'Probably something medical.'

00:51.442 --> 00:54.228
Have the coroner's assistant
look at it.

00:54.315 --> 00:57.274
Scratches on the doors.
Must be from his cuffs.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.711
He was alive
when he was put inside.

00:59.798 --> 01:02.105
How long would it take to die
in here? Like, five, six days?

01:02.192 --> 01:04.586
That's the right place for it.
No one in earshot.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.544
Make sure the techs search
every inch of this floor

- Yeah. Sorry, Lisbon.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.902
I had my phone turned off.

01:16.989 --> 01:19.209
We're in the middle
of a toxic waste dump. Hurry up.

Well, it's nice to meet you,
Hailey.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.442
How'd you know
my name was Patrick?

03:01.529 --> 03:02.617
Your friend told me.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.404
Which friend's that?

03:07.491 --> 03:10.277
The one who brought me here.
He gave me this.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.894
He didn't do anything else,

He told me to ask you
a question.

03:22.332 --> 03:23.551
What's that?

03:23.638 --> 03:25.335
He said to ask you..

03:26.380 --> 03:28.295
...do you give up yet?

a nearby park about an hour ago.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.755
Her class was on a field trip.

03:53.842 --> 03:56.236
It doesn't look like she was
harmed. Her mother's on her way.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.715
Where's Jane?

03:57.802 --> 03:59.804
Over there.
He hasn't said much.

04:01.589 --> 04:02.633
Gonna run this note
they left for Jane

04:02.720 --> 04:04.069
check it for prints andDNA.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.723
You won't get any.

Today's the day that his wife
and daughter..

04:10.902 --> 04:13.122
- I know. Nine years ago.
- Yeah.

04:13.209 --> 04:15.167
- Would you excuse me, sir?
- Yeah.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.259
Hey there.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.651
Hey there, yourself.

my friend Teresa.

- Hi, Hailey.
- I like your hair.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.617
Thank you.

04:29.704 --> 04:33.316
Patrick is teaching me
how to make a quarter disappear.

04:33.403 --> 04:34.796
- The kid's a natural.
- No doubt.

04:36.450 --> 04:39.540
Hailey, hello.
My name's Agent Wainwright.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.193

be here soon.

we're gonna talk to you'

04:42.717 --> 04:44.893

Is that alright?'

04:44.980 --> 04:47.330
What man?

04:47.417 --> 04:50.028
The one who sent you
to Mr. Jane

04:50.115 --> 04:51.900
who drew the face
on your hand.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.904
I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:58.646 --> 05:00.517
Hailey, why don't you go
and show that policewoman

05:00.604 --> 05:01.953
your new trick?

05:02.040 --> 05:03.390
- Okay.
- Have fun.

05:07.219 --> 05:10.701
Um, I...I don't understand.
She doesn't remember?

05:10.788 --> 05:12.877
You hypnotized her.

05:12.964 --> 05:16.707
No, I just planted a suggestion
for her to forget Red John.

05:16.794 --> 05:19.623
Why would you do that?
She could identify him.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.799
He's white.
He wore a baseball cap.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.627
He had an odd voice.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.150
Alright, look,
she might remember more

05:25.237 --> 05:26.238
if she were
questioned properly.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.719
Jane. Jane, she's a-a witness.

05:28.806 --> 05:32.375
People who can identify Red John
end up dead.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.681
I get that you feel
protective here.

05:33.768 --> 05:34.899
Do you?

05:34.986 --> 05:36.553
- This is not your call.
- Yes, it is.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.513
If you try to question her
or even talk to her

05:39.600 --> 05:40.905
I will hurt you badly.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.214
Did he really
just threaten me?

05:47.259 --> 05:51.002
Jane, I know it's hard coming
here, especially like this

05:51.089 --> 05:53.353
and I'm sorry.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.354
I'm not gonna ask you
to apologize

05:54.441 --> 05:56.138
to Wainwright
but he's right.

05:56.225 --> 05:59.794
The little girl's a witness.
We should interview her.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.622
You know what Red John's
trying to do, don't you?

06:03.232 --> 06:04.581
He asked me
if I'm ready to quit.

06:04.668 --> 06:07.236
He's messing with your head.
Don't let him.

06:08.933 --> 06:11.066
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.459
[cell phone ringing]

06:12.546 --> 06:15.375
Appreciate your concern.
Your phone is ringing.

[ringing continues]

06:17.899 --> 06:18.856
Hey, Rigsby.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.512
So that thing that we found was
a surgical heart valve

06:22.599 --> 06:24.384
implanted in the victim.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.212
Traced the serial number on it
to a guy named Antonio Castro.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.519
According to SFPD,
he disappeared 11 months ago.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.260
[Lisbon]
Disappeared how?

06:31.347 --> 06:33.654
He sent some e-mails from his
home on the night of June 17th.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.351
'The next morning,
he was gone.'

06:35.438 --> 06:36.831
'Car parked in the driveway.
Front door was locked.'

06:36.918 --> 06:38.659
'No sign of forced entry
or struggle.'

06:38.746 --> 06:40.704
His fiance filed a missing
persons report that afternoon.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.358
SFPD find anything?

06:42.445 --> 06:44.839
No. No contact with the family.
They're out of state.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.581
No travel plans,
no enemies, no money troubles.

06:47.668 --> 06:48.973
[Lisbon]
What'd he do for a living?

06:49.060 --> 06:51.236
He's former military.
Two tours in Iraq.

06:51.323 --> 06:52.977
'The past five years,
he's been working as a broker'

06:53.064 --> 06:55.066
'in a financial company,
RF Victor.'

06:55.153 --> 06:57.199
[Lisbon]
'Van Pelt, bring in
all the SFPD files'

06:57.286 --> 06:58.766
and any physical evidence.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.507
Cho, Rigsby,
I want you to put together

07:00.594 --> 07:02.596
a time line and a list
of all the contacts

07:02.683 --> 07:04.032
the victim had
before he disappeared.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.816
We need to interview everybody.

07:05.903 --> 07:07.775
Jane and I will go talk
to the people he worked with.

07:07.862 --> 07:11.387
Jane.
Anything to offer?

07:11.474 --> 07:13.998
Uh, well, there's not a lot
to go off, is there?

07:14.912 --> 07:16.087
Your point being..

07:17.480 --> 07:20.265
No point.
Shall we go?

07:20.352 --> 07:21.745
Let's go.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.358
Jane seem off to you?

07:27.708 --> 07:28.709
Always.

07:39.589 --> 07:43.506
Oh. Dennis Victor.
Uh, you're from, uh, CBI?

07:43.593 --> 07:46.117
Hi. I'm AgentLisbon,
and this is Patrick Jane.

07:46.204 --> 07:49.120
You're absolutely positive
that you found Antonio's body?

07:49.207 --> 07:50.861
Yes, sir. It was confirmed.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.689
[sighs]
Well, we all knew
this day could come.

07:52.776 --> 07:54.517
Still, a shock.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.737
He was engaged to my niece.

07:56.824 --> 07:58.347
I feel it very personally.
This way.

08:00.305 --> 08:03.308
[Lisbon]
'What exactly do you
do here, Mr. Victor?'

08:03.395 --> 08:05.093
[Victor]
'We're a financial derivatives
broker.'

08:05.180 --> 08:08.705
'We offer
exchange-traded derivatives'

08:08.792 --> 08:13.275
options, futures, and a few
over-the-counter products.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.320
So basically,
you're just thieves

08:15.407 --> 08:18.236
in, uh, ties and suspenders.

08:18.323 --> 08:20.935
[laughs]
That would be
the popular view.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.937
Not entirely accurate.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.329
Up this way.

Agent Lisbon

08:30.379 --> 08:32.599
Mr. Jane,
Ian Breitler.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.078
He recruited
Antonio to the firm

08:34.165 --> 08:35.776
'and he mentored him
during his first year.'

08:35.863 --> 08:37.473
It's great to meet you.
Thanks for coming.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.128
This is Ben Marx. He runs
the division Antonio was in.

08:40.215 --> 08:41.651
He was his supervisor.

08:41.738 --> 08:43.958
- Welcome.
- Sit. Please, sit.

08:46.221 --> 08:47.309
[clears throat]
Mr. Jane.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.180
Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.313
What did Antonio Castro
do for you here?

08:51.400 --> 08:54.359
He-he was a broker.
Handled customer accounts.

08:54.446 --> 08:55.970
How'd he get along
with people?

08:56.057 --> 08:59.713
Oh, he was universally loved,
a leader in the company.

08:59.800 --> 09:00.757
[Ian]
'Absolutely.'

09:01.758 --> 09:03.325
You don't agree?

09:03.412 --> 09:05.675
Well, who's universally loved?
He was popular.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.244
Do you know anything
about his family?

09:09.331 --> 09:13.204
His mother's in a nursing home
in Flagstaff. Alzheimer's.

09:13.291 --> 09:16.904
And his sister converted to
Islam and moved to Indonesia.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.383
They weren't in touch.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.690
And did he have
any problems at work?

09:20.777 --> 09:22.866
Not that I was aware of.

09:22.953 --> 09:27.088
No. All of his performance
reviews were exemplary.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.132
Isn't that right, Ben?

09:28.219 --> 09:29.743
If there were any issues

09:29.830 --> 09:31.135
I wasn't aware of them
at the time.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.964
- Mm. Interesting.
- Excuse me?

09:34.051 --> 09:35.879
Well, he's telling the truth,
but you two aren't.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.968
Something going on with Castro,
what was the big secret?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.058
There wasn't one,
I assure you.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.452
- Yes, there was.
- I'm afraid you're mistaken.

09:43.539 --> 09:44.975
No, I'm-I'm sure,
just as I'm sure

09:45.062 --> 09:46.716
you're not very fond
of Mr. Breitler here.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.022
I'm Marx. He's Breitler.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.371
Yes, well, whatever
your name is

09:49.458 --> 09:51.155
your boss doesn't
like you very much

09:51.242 --> 09:53.244
and I wouldn't be surprised
if he canned you very soon.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.595
[Victor]
'That's a very interesting
observation because, uh'

09:55.682 --> 09:59.555
Ben here was made a principal
in the firm last month

09:59.642 --> 10:01.557
at my express request.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.217
Okay.

10:10.740 --> 10:14.048
- What's going on, Jane?
- Nothing.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.267
Oh, I may be a little out of
sorts, but it's nothing serious.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.617
Wanna get something to eat?

10:17.704 --> 10:19.967
No, I think I might take
the rest of the day.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.446
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm gonna get a cab.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.796
I'll see you tomorrow,
Lisbon.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.502
Hello, Mr. Jane.
Good to see you again.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.243
- You, too.
- Your table's ready.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.593
Thank you.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.512
And your order
will be right up.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.122
Thank you.

the building.'

13:47.739 --> 13:49.829
I know, sir.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.787
I could suspend Jane
for this

13:51.874 --> 13:55.225
but I think what happened
was a cry for help.

13:55.312 --> 13:58.141
I just need to find out
what the issue is.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.751
Me, too, sir.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.797
If you don't mind, I think
I should do the talking.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.499
Jane.

14:08.586 --> 14:09.892
Mm.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.201
[inhales deeply]

14:15.463 --> 14:16.638
What's going on?

14:17.944 --> 14:21.643
Well..

14:21.730 --> 14:24.428
...I have a little hangover

14:24.515 --> 14:27.388
uh, if you must know.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.085
Why did you burn
your Red John files?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.348
[exhales deeply]

14:40.880 --> 14:42.229
Because he's right.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.015
It's time to give up.

14:47.582 --> 14:48.757
Seriously?

14:51.281 --> 14:52.935
What do you mean?

14:53.022 --> 14:54.197
Well, nothing's working.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.027
Nothing.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.292
It's just a game,
and he keeps winning.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.822
The only way for me to stop him
is if I stop playing.

15:12.563 --> 15:13.782
Meaning what?

15:17.873 --> 15:19.353
Meaning I put it behind me.

15:22.791 --> 15:23.966
I move on.

15:27.361 --> 15:28.840
That's a big change, Jane.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.713
[scoffs]

15:31.800 --> 15:32.932
Well, change is good.

15:34.324 --> 15:35.369
Isn't it?

15:36.805 --> 15:40.417
So...are you
leaving the CBI?

15:40.504 --> 15:42.811
No, of course not.
What would I do for amusement?

15:42.898 --> 15:44.421
Speaking of which,
isn't there some person

15:44.508 --> 15:47.207
or something we should be
investigating or such?

15:47.294 --> 15:48.860
We're supposed to talk
to the victim's fiance.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.297
Okay. Let's go.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.212
Jane, I strongly recommend

15:52.299 --> 15:54.344
that you talk to one of our
counselors about what happened.

15:54.431 --> 15:56.390
I think it could help you.

15:56.477 --> 15:59.001
Luther, there's no time.
I got perps to break.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.660
Hey. How's the time line going?
Anything jump out?

16:05.747 --> 16:08.924
Yeah. Castro did completely
normal stuff, then disappeared.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.665
He was at a charity event,
right before he vanished, yeah?

16:10.752 --> 16:12.101
What happened there?

16:12.188 --> 16:14.408
It was a fund-raiser
for the homeless.

16:14.495 --> 16:18.629
[sighs]
Witnesses say Castro was
calm, relaxed, left alone.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.109
Are we gonna catch any
good breaks in this case?

16:20.196 --> 16:22.155
I doubt it.

16:22.242 --> 16:25.288
- What's the package?
- It's a baby monitor.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.595
It's got audio and video.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.597
Plus, it's 2-way,
so I can talk to Ben in his crib

16:29.684 --> 16:31.294
without leaving my bed.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.904
That should terrify him.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.038
Hey. So I've been going through
the stuff SFPD collected

16:36.125 --> 16:40.434
at Castro's office
and I found this, "19:24."

16:40.521 --> 16:43.089
It was stuck
to a folder on his desk.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.395
He was ex-military.
Could it be military time?

16:45.482 --> 16:47.093
No, there wouldn't be a colon
between the nine and two.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.572
It's something else.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.705
Well, if you have any ideas,
let me know.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.576
I'm not finding
anything else useful.

16:52.663 --> 16:55.144
You know that Jane told Lisbon
he was giving up on Red John?

16:55.231 --> 16:56.885
- Yeah.
- It's hard to believe.

16:59.192 --> 17:02.238
You think he's losing it?
Like cracking up?

17:03.500 --> 17:04.632
No.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.025
- Nah.
- Nah.

17:09.071 --> 17:11.030
Thank you for talking to us,
Miss Victor.

17:11.117 --> 17:14.424
Of course. I would've met you
at the office but I jus..

17:14.511 --> 17:17.123
I couldn't go in
after I heard the news.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.081
How long were
you and Mr. Castro engaged?

17:19.168 --> 17:20.604
Almost a year.

17:20.691 --> 17:23.520
We'd been together
about two years before that.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.131
And how did you meet?

17:25.218 --> 17:27.829
Through work.
I'm with a PR agency

17:27.916 --> 17:32.486
that handles financial firms,
including my uncle's.

17:32.573 --> 17:37.230
Most of the guys that work in
finance are overgrown frat boys

17:37.317 --> 17:39.101
but..

17:39.188 --> 17:40.972
...Antonio was a man.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.715
Maybe it was his time in the
service. I don't know but..

17:44.802 --> 17:46.804
[exhales sharply]

17:48.110 --> 17:50.547
...he was a great soul.

17:50.634 --> 17:53.289
He was wise
and kind.

17:55.552 --> 17:57.424
I'm sorry.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.078
I thought
I was ready for this.

18:01.776 --> 18:02.777
Did he have any enemies?

18:04.344 --> 18:07.216
Antonio had a very strong sense
of morality.

18:07.303 --> 18:09.262
He believed in
right and wrong

18:09.349 --> 18:11.133
and would tell you
which was which.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.615
I loved him for that,
but not everyone did.

18:15.964 --> 18:18.314
Anyone in particular?

18:18.401 --> 18:20.969
I can't think
of anyone offhand.

18:21.056 --> 18:24.320
Uh, Lisbon, my head's a little
foggy and, uh, drifty

18:24.407 --> 18:25.843
so I'm gonna push it
along a bit.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.149
What are you guilty about?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.676
I don't understand.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.939
The tears and all the talk
of how wonderful he was.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.811
He's been gone a year

18:36.898 --> 18:40.031
and you're behaving like
he disappeared this morning.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.556
- That's guilt.
- No, it's not.

18:42.643 --> 18:45.385
It's not quite homicidal,
but there's something.

18:45.472 --> 18:46.951
Were you cheating on him?

18:47.038 --> 18:49.171
- No.
- Not while he was alive.

18:49.258 --> 18:52.000
I bet now. Yes, that's it.

18:52.087 --> 18:55.351
You've been sleeping around
on the sainted dead fiance.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.484
- No, I haven't.
- Tell us the truth.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.095
[sighs]

19:00.182 --> 19:01.879
Well, it's complicated.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.054
It's simple.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.579
You've moved on. It happens.

19:05.666 --> 19:08.277
You just don't want to admit it
because you think it looks bad.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.670
Are you trying
to make me cry again?

19:09.757 --> 19:11.019
No, I-I'm not.
I mean, I'm not

19:11.106 --> 19:13.021
but if you want to, then..

19:13.108 --> 19:14.196
...please, cry.

19:14.283 --> 19:15.284
- Get it out.
- Jane.

19:17.547 --> 19:20.202
Who is it, Marcy?

19:20.289 --> 19:24.032
Hey, Cho, so Marcy Victor was
sleeping with Ian Breitler

19:24.119 --> 19:25.686
which Breitler conveniently
forgot to tell us

19:25.773 --> 19:27.296
when we talked to him.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.168
Pick him up. See what
he has to say for himself.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.044
Why did you hide your
relationship with Marcy Victor

19:36.131 --> 19:38.133
Mr. Breitler?

19:38.220 --> 19:41.745
Antonio was a sensitive topic
around the office, okay?

19:41.832 --> 19:43.617
Until you guys found him

19:43.704 --> 19:45.358
a lot of people were hoping
he'd come walking back

19:45.445 --> 19:46.663
through the door.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.578
Since you're sleeping
with his fiance

19:48.665 --> 19:50.711
I'm guessing
you're not one of 'em.

19:50.798 --> 19:51.842
I just didn't think
that the time to announce

19:51.929 --> 19:53.670
that Marcy and I
are a couple

19:53.757 --> 19:56.151
was when we had just found out
that Antonio was dead.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.500
Hey, Cho.

19:57.587 --> 20:00.590
Ian, what is that on your..

20:00.677 --> 20:01.635
...jacket?

20:01.722 --> 20:03.767
- There's...eh.
- What?

20:03.854 --> 20:07.075
It's a hair.
That could be a clue.

20:07.162 --> 20:08.468
It's my hair.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.428
Hmm. Fair enough.

20:12.515 --> 20:13.734
Ian doesn't think there's
anything significant

20:13.821 --> 20:15.866
about his relationship
with Marcy Victor.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.520
Yes, I'm inclined to agree.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.957
Sleazy, maybe.

20:20.044 --> 20:21.611
But motive for murder?
I don't think so.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.352
I'm more interested
in Ian's other secret.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.225
What's that?

20:26.312 --> 20:30.229
The one that you
and Dennis Victor were keeping.

20:30.316 --> 20:33.101
The one that has to do
with Antonio Castro's work.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.496
Don't know what
you're talking about.

20:36.583 --> 20:39.890
Oh.
You're tensing up, Ian.

20:39.977 --> 20:42.197
And you have asthma.
That's not good.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.504
That kind of tension goes
straight to the lungs

20:44.591 --> 20:48.290
squeezes them, makes them
get smaller and smaller.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.250
Is there a question here?

20:51.337 --> 20:52.860
The windpipe shrinks up

20:52.947 --> 20:54.992
and every breath you take
is harder than the last.

20:55.079 --> 20:56.342
It's hard to breathe.

20:56.429 --> 20:57.734
The last thing you
want to do is get upset.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.388
- This is ridiculous.
- Don't panic.

20:59.475 --> 21:03.087
What are you looking for?
What is it? Is it this?

21:03.174 --> 21:04.654
Gimme that.

21:04.741 --> 21:07.309
Tell me what I need to know.

21:07.396 --> 21:09.224
[sighs]
You can't do that.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.270
- He can't-he can't do that.
- He's doing it.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.749
[sighs]

21:12.836 --> 21:14.577
Yeah, you know,
you're probably right.

21:14.664 --> 21:17.798
- Changed my mind.
- For God sake.

21:17.885 --> 21:19.800
[sighs]
I'm calling my lawyer.

21:19.887 --> 21:22.193
Sure. Go ahead. It'll only take
him an hour to get here.

21:24.326 --> 21:25.588
[exhales deeply]

21:28.417 --> 21:29.505
[groans]

21:29.592 --> 21:30.637
Castro was a thief.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.554
He was stealing
from the firm.

21:34.641 --> 21:37.252
We didn't find out
until after he disappeared

21:37.339 --> 21:39.123
when Marx took over
his accounts.

21:39.210 --> 21:40.473
Mm.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.127
Hey!
Come on!

21:44.694 --> 21:46.174
[exhales deeply]

21:48.916 --> 21:51.135
- How much did Castro steal?
- Breitler says he doesn't know.

21:51.222 --> 21:52.354
Marx and Dennis Victor
didn't share

21:52.441 --> 21:53.921
the numbers
with anyone else.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.662
Why didn't they tell us that
to start with?

21:55.749 --> 21:57.751
Victor's order. No one
was allowed to say anything.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.274
Alright, let's bring him in
and sort it out.

21:59.361 --> 22:00.667
- Sure.
- Hey.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.541
How does Jane seem to you?

22:05.628 --> 22:07.543
Different.
I think he's in trouble.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.199
Me, too. Where is he?

22:11.286 --> 22:13.462
He said he still had a headache.
Went out to go get some Aspirin.

22:13.549 --> 22:14.724
Alright.

22:16.900 --> 22:17.858
[birds chirping]

22:17.945 --> 22:19.250
Mr. Wineman.

22:20.687 --> 22:22.471
Beautiful cemetery.

22:22.558 --> 22:25.518
You should be proud.
So neat.

22:25.605 --> 22:29.348
Mm. Thank you. Uh, what-what
can I do for you, Mr. Jane?

22:29.435 --> 22:31.828
Well, like I said on the phone,
um, I'm with the CBI.

22:31.915 --> 22:34.178
We're pursuing
a particularly vicious killer.

22:35.179 --> 22:36.485
Tough case.

22:36.572 --> 22:38.487
But with your help,
we can crack it.

22:38.574 --> 22:41.055
You're not using this grave
right away, are you?

22:41.142 --> 22:44.058
No. The services aren't until
the day after tomorrow.

22:44.145 --> 22:45.233
Good.
We'll be done by then.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.410
Wh-what do you mean done?

22:50.151 --> 22:52.545
We need to run
a small police operation here.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.851
Nothing I can tell you about,
but you can help us.

22:54.938 --> 22:57.245
Help us remove a very dangerous
killer from the street.

22:57.332 --> 22:59.682
You want to help us,
don't you?

22:59.769 --> 23:01.554
You'll help us?

23:01.641 --> 23:05.384
- Help? Uh, y-yes. Of course.
- Good.

23:05.471 --> 23:09.083
We'll need a coffin as well.
Nothing too fancy.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.085
- A coffin?
- Yes. Down there.

23:17.178 --> 23:18.658
After Antonio vanished,
Ben here took over his accounts

23:18.745 --> 23:21.835
and four weeks in,
he found something.

23:21.922 --> 23:24.490
Antonio was stealing money
from customers

23:24.577 --> 23:27.449
and hiding it with paper losses
on fictional investments.

23:27.536 --> 23:29.973
He'd been doing it
for about six months.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.235
- 'Mm.'
- How much money did he steal?

23:31.322 --> 23:32.715
Oh, we'll never be sure.

23:32.802 --> 23:35.022
Somewhere between
seven and ten million.

23:35.109 --> 23:36.980
- Where's the money?
- We have no idea.

23:37.067 --> 23:40.201
Antonio's transactions were
brilliantly complex.

23:40.288 --> 23:43.422
The money's
essentially untraceable.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.249
[Cho]
'This wasn't
in the SFPD files.'

23:45.336 --> 23:47.077
- 'Did you tell them?'
- 'No, they didn't ask.'

23:47.164 --> 23:49.515
And we didn't discover
the theft

23:49.602 --> 23:51.691
until after
they had interviewed us.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.562
You could've picked up
the phone.

23:53.649 --> 23:56.826
Agent, because we discovered
the theft internally

23:56.913 --> 23:59.699
we were able to make good
on our customers' losses.

23:59.786 --> 24:01.004
They don't even know
they were robbed.

24:01.091 --> 24:04.181
That cost my firm
a great deal of money

24:04.268 --> 24:07.620
but it saved us
major embarrassment.

24:07.707 --> 24:08.925
And I couldn't see any value
in publicizing

24:09.012 --> 24:12.320
what had been
so fortunately hidden.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.540
It was evidence
in a homicide.

24:14.627 --> 24:16.063
Well, we had to balance justice
with self-preservation.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.543
[Marx]
'Absolutely.'

24:17.630 --> 24:21.503
I think we found
a very good middle course.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.027
This is obstruction of justice,
and I'm gonna have you charged.

24:24.114 --> 24:26.465
I'm sorry. You-you asked
if we knew about anything

24:26.552 --> 24:28.684
Antonio had done at the time.

24:28.771 --> 24:31.600
Right? We said we didn't know
anything at the time.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.167
- Mm.
- All true.

24:33.254 --> 24:35.430
- Tell it to your lawyers.
- No need.

24:36.387 --> 24:37.476
We are lawyers.

24:40.348 --> 24:41.741
If there's nothing else..

24:41.828 --> 24:43.873
[clears throat]

24:43.960 --> 24:46.136
- Jane.
- What?

24:46.223 --> 24:47.703
I'm trying to figure out
what this number

24:47.790 --> 24:49.444
on Castro's desk means.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.402
The only thing I can find are
a couple of references

24:51.490 --> 24:53.361
to some sort
of high-end social club.

24:53.448 --> 24:56.190
Any idea why they'd name it
19:24?

24:56.277 --> 24:57.278
The Bible.

24:58.540 --> 25:01.064
Matthew 19:24.

25:01.151 --> 25:02.762
"Again I say unto you,
it is easier for a camel

25:02.849 --> 25:04.459
to go through the eye
of a needle than it is"--

25:04.546 --> 25:06.940
"Than for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of heaven."

25:07.027 --> 25:09.333
- Yes.
- That's weird.

25:09.420 --> 25:10.857
Well, it's an ironic joke.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.816
Since the rich
won't get into heaven

25:13.903 --> 25:15.426
they should enjoy
their life on earth.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.124
Okay, but why did Castro care?

25:17.211 --> 25:18.865
He wasn't a member,
far as I can tell.

25:20.606 --> 25:22.564
Mm. Of course he wasn't.

25:27.395 --> 25:29.353
Well, that clears things up.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.007
[elevator bell dings]

25:31.094 --> 25:32.879
Oh, guys!

25:32.966 --> 25:37.623
[clears throat]
Tell me about, uh, 19:24.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.015
And don't deny
you're members

25:39.102 --> 25:41.583
'cause I can see it
all over your faces.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.803
Well, you know,
it's-it's a club.

25:43.890 --> 25:45.108
Small, private.

25:45.195 --> 25:46.632
For the filthy rich?

25:46.719 --> 25:49.156
- For people of means.
- Oh.

25:49.243 --> 25:50.940
No one is supposed
to talk about it.

25:51.027 --> 25:52.812
First rule of fight club
and all that.

25:52.899 --> 25:53.900
Okay.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.380
Who else is members?

25:56.467 --> 25:59.253
- Breitler? Your niece?
- Both of them.

25:59.340 --> 26:00.994
Lots of people from my firm,
other firms.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.778
So i-if your niece
was a member

26:02.865 --> 26:06.565
then surely, uh, Antonio Castro
was asked about joining.

26:06.652 --> 26:07.870
- 'Yes.'
- Yeah.

26:07.957 --> 26:10.307
Shortly before
he disappeared.

26:10.394 --> 26:13.920
Right. And to become a member
of this, um, fancy

26:14.007 --> 26:15.704
elite little club, uh

26:15.791 --> 26:17.837
I'm assuming you need to
have some kind of a hazing.

26:17.924 --> 26:20.230
[chuckles]
Yes.

26:20.317 --> 26:22.798
Prospective members are tapped
by current members

26:22.885 --> 26:26.193
and forced to do all sorts
of embarrassing things.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.586
[laughs]
Oh.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.805
- Good fun.
- Sure.

26:29.892 --> 26:32.460
This charity event
that Antonio Castro attended

26:32.547 --> 26:35.724
the night he disappeared,
was that held at the club?

26:35.811 --> 26:38.379
As a matter of fact, it was.
Antonio was there as a guest.

26:38.466 --> 26:39.946
[elevator bell dings]
Mm.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.817
You interested in membership,
Mr. Jane?

26:41.904 --> 26:43.036
- Me?
- Yeah.

26:43.123 --> 26:45.473
Uh, no. No.
Not the club type.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.866
- Oh.
- Thank you.

26:49.172 --> 26:51.261
I've got an accountant
looking at Castro's trades

26:51.348 --> 26:52.741
but they're so complicated, he
can barely make sense of them.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.221
What else do we have?

26:54.308 --> 26:55.918
I talked to 13 people
who met with Castro

26:56.005 --> 26:58.268
before he disappeared.
Nothing unusual or suspicious.

26:58.355 --> 27:00.357
I've been through
all the forensic evidence

27:00.444 --> 27:02.969
SFPD gathered from Castro's
apartment and office.

27:03.056 --> 27:05.058
- Nothing jumps out.
- Time line?

27:05.145 --> 27:07.669
- 'Nothing that leads anywhere.'
- 'We don't have anything.'

27:07.756 --> 27:10.019
We have something. We just
don't know what it is yet.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.630
I do. Let's go.

27:11.717 --> 27:14.110
- Where?
- Uh, 19:24 club.

27:14.197 --> 27:16.896
I convinced Marcy Victor
to throw an emergency meeting.

27:16.983 --> 27:19.072
- What for?
- To solve the case, of course.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.205
Where'd you get this?

27:23.163 --> 27:24.643
[indistinct chattering]

27:24.730 --> 27:26.122
[Jane]
'Do you have
the exits covered?'

27:26.209 --> 27:28.124
Rigsby, Cho, and Van Pelt
are by the doors.

27:28.211 --> 27:29.822
Okay.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.388
Hello, everybody.

27:31.475 --> 27:33.390
Thank you for coming.

27:33.477 --> 27:35.392
I'm Patrick Jane with the CBI.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.786
As you've been told,
we're investigating the death

27:37.873 --> 27:41.398
of Marcy Victor's fiance
Antonio Castro.

27:41.485 --> 27:45.533
What you haven't been told is
that the killer is in this room.

27:45.620 --> 27:48.188
All I need to identify him

27:48.275 --> 27:50.190
are the answers
to a few questions.

27:50.277 --> 27:53.193
- What kind of questions?
- Very simple ones.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.500
Uh, you, ma'am,
the frayed thread on your sleeve

27:56.587 --> 28:00.243
'plus last season's shoes
suggest money trouble. True?'

28:00.330 --> 28:02.550
No. No, I've..
No, we're fine.

28:02.637 --> 28:03.899
[chuckles]
Uh, we're fine.

28:03.986 --> 28:05.422
See? A lie.

28:06.597 --> 28:08.599
Did you kill Antonio Castro?

28:08.687 --> 28:10.253
I didn't even know him.

28:10.340 --> 28:11.559
And there's the truth.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.475
When I watch you tell a lie

28:14.562 --> 28:17.739
it helps me determine whether
you're telling the truth.

28:17.826 --> 28:21.612
For example, Marcy here
is sleeping with Ian.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.833
You're not committed to him
emotionally, and you don't think

28:24.920 --> 28:27.357
he's half the man that
your fiance was, do you?

28:27.444 --> 28:28.924
No, that's not true.

28:29.011 --> 28:31.057
A lie.
Thank you very much.

28:31.144 --> 28:33.407
- Did you kill Antonio?
- Of course not.

28:33.494 --> 28:35.017
And there's the truth.

28:35.104 --> 28:36.932
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Please be patient.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.542
Take a seat, ma'am.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.370
Mr. Marx, you're more
than a little twisted

28:40.457 --> 28:42.808
'in the bedroom,
aren't you?'

28:42.895 --> 28:45.288
'Latex and whips are your thing,
are they not?'

28:45.375 --> 28:46.725
[indistinct murmur]

28:46.812 --> 28:48.335
Not at all.

28:48.422 --> 28:50.119
Did you kill Antonio Castro?

28:50.206 --> 28:52.513
No, I did not.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.689
Hmm. Uh, you, sir.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.996
[chuckles]
If you think
I'm saying a word

28:57.083 --> 28:59.433
without a lawyer on either side
of me, you're crazy.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.218
And any of you that put up with
this is as crazy as he is.

29:03.524 --> 29:06.048
Ladies and gentlemen.

29:06.135 --> 29:08.921
If everybody could just stay
in the room, please.

29:09.008 --> 29:10.749
[indistinct chattering]

29:10.836 --> 29:12.663
I don't understand.
What were you trying to do?

29:14.709 --> 29:16.885
The plan was to, uh

29:16.972 --> 29:19.453
scare the killer
into making a run for it.

29:19.540 --> 29:20.846
You thought that would work?

29:20.933 --> 29:25.198
Certainly had a fair chance,
I thought.

29:25.285 --> 29:27.330
I'm gonna go tell Rigsby
and the others to stand down.

29:27.417 --> 29:28.767
You stay here.

29:35.730 --> 29:38.211
Yeah, it was crazy. I'll tell
you about it when I get there.

29:38.298 --> 29:39.516
Alright. Bye.

29:39.603 --> 29:42.171
- Marx!
- Mr. Jane.

29:42.258 --> 29:43.956
That didn't work out for you
so well, did it?

29:44.043 --> 29:45.958
No, it went pretty much
as planned.

29:46.045 --> 29:48.003
- The case is cracked.
- Oh, yeah?

29:48.090 --> 29:49.788
- Is that your car?
- Yep.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.659
- Wow. That's a nice ride.
- Thanks.

29:51.746 --> 29:54.836
Let's take a little drive.
I'll tell you all about it.

29:54.923 --> 29:57.143
- Ride where?
- Oh, not far.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.232
I mean, don't you want to be
the first to know who did it?

30:01.277 --> 30:02.844
Okay.

30:02.931 --> 30:05.891
- What's in the bag?
- Oh, a baby monitor.

30:05.978 --> 30:07.893
[chuckles]

30:07.980 --> 30:09.416
I-I'll explain later.

30:23.212 --> 30:24.823
Turn right up here.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.175
So how exactly did that mess
back at the club

30:29.262 --> 30:30.393
work out for you,
Mr. Jane?

30:32.961 --> 30:34.180
Wasn't looking for a killer.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.487
I was looking for a liar.

30:37.574 --> 30:40.055
Someone that can answer
an embarrassing question

30:40.142 --> 30:42.101
in public
without getting flustered.

30:42.188 --> 30:43.537
Hmm.

30:43.624 --> 30:44.930
Why was that important?

30:45.017 --> 30:48.281
Castro's killer was
a vicious sadist.

30:48.368 --> 30:51.458
Someone that truly enjoyed
watching other people's pain.

30:51.545 --> 30:52.894
He can't show it.

30:52.981 --> 30:55.288
Ergo, a first-rate liar.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.377
And you found him?

30:58.030 --> 30:59.379
Sure.

31:01.511 --> 31:02.904
It was you.

31:02.991 --> 31:04.036
Turn, uh, here.

31:05.298 --> 31:06.995
Me?

31:07.082 --> 31:10.694
I noticed when we first talked,
you and, uh, Victor and Breitler

31:10.781 --> 31:12.261
said that Castro hadn't done
anything wrong

31:12.348 --> 31:13.959
and I could tell
the other two were lying

31:14.046 --> 31:15.743
but you seemed
to be telling the truth.

31:17.179 --> 31:19.312
And not too many people
fool me like that.

31:20.791 --> 31:22.837
So I tested you again
at the club.

31:24.099 --> 31:26.058
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

31:26.145 --> 31:29.235
- How'd I do?
- Outstanding.

31:29.322 --> 31:30.845
One of the best liars
I've ever seen.

31:32.934 --> 31:34.544
It explains your success
in sales

31:34.631 --> 31:36.590
and, uh,
the kinky sex life.

31:36.677 --> 31:40.028
Just, uh, just-just pull in
a little up here.

31:51.648 --> 31:53.041
None of that means
I killed Antonio.

31:54.347 --> 31:55.696
Sure, it does.

31:55.783 --> 31:57.785
- I can prove it.
- How?

31:59.134 --> 32:00.570
Walk with me,
and I'll show you.

32:03.312 --> 32:05.488
[intense music]

32:07.795 --> 32:09.057
Castro didn't take the money.

32:10.189 --> 32:11.494
Too much of a boy scout.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.107
It was you that stole it.

32:15.194 --> 32:17.370
Castro had figured out
that someone was stealing

32:17.457 --> 32:19.894
so he, uh,
he came to you.

32:19.981 --> 32:22.462
Why?
Because you're his boss.

32:22.549 --> 32:25.465
What he didn't realize,
that you were also the thief.

32:25.552 --> 32:27.293
Something's wrong
with the future tallies.

32:27.380 --> 32:29.077
I-I just can't
put my finger on what.

32:29.164 --> 32:30.296
Alright.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.386
Okay. I'll look into it.

32:33.473 --> 32:35.562
[Jane]
Then you had to kill him.

32:35.649 --> 32:37.825
How exactly did I do that?

32:37.912 --> 32:40.349
Kind of brilliantly,
I have to say.

32:40.436 --> 32:42.612
[Jane]
The 19:24 club
was the ticket.

32:42.699 --> 32:45.528
Castro was gonna join, and the night the charity function

32:45.615 --> 32:48.096
took place, you told him
he was gonna be initiated

32:48.183 --> 32:49.706
but he had to be hazed first.

32:49.793 --> 32:51.839
- You ready?
- Now?

32:51.926 --> 32:54.233
Shh. It's supposed to be
a surprise.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.670
Get your car
and meet me around the corner.

32:56.757 --> 32:59.238
I'm gonna drive you there.
But don't tell anybody

32:59.325 --> 33:01.022
where you're going
or what you're doing, okay?

33:01.109 --> 33:03.677
Exactly how embarrassing
is this gonna be?

33:03.764 --> 33:06.723
Awesomely, my brother.

33:06.810 --> 33:10.423
But I do have a
little help here for you.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.557
Make it go a lot easier.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.299
Trust me.

33:19.432 --> 33:20.737
So you took him
to the factory.

33:21.956 --> 33:23.436
You walked him downstairs..

33:25.742 --> 33:26.830
...to the basement.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.227
He did everything you asked.

33:35.752 --> 33:39.713
What the hell?
Yeah. Be careful..

33:39.800 --> 33:41.845
- Yeah.
- It'll be alright.

33:41.932 --> 33:43.456
Drawers too.

33:43.543 --> 33:44.979
- In the box.
- Get in the box.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.589
You can do it.

33:54.858 --> 33:56.686
Alright, Antonio,
you good?

33:56.773 --> 33:58.384
- Yeah. What now?
- Just you wait.

34:00.473 --> 34:03.128
[door hinges creaks]

34:06.783 --> 34:08.002
And then you went
to his house

34:08.089 --> 34:09.917
and sent e-mails
from his computer

34:10.004 --> 34:12.311
so that no one could connect
his disappearance

34:12.398 --> 34:13.790
with the club or you.

34:13.877 --> 34:16.402
Mm. Well, this-that sounds
pretty cool.

34:17.664 --> 34:20.058
Except Castro was a thief.

34:20.145 --> 34:22.712
All the trades were
on his account.

34:22.799 --> 34:25.541
You had weeks
to fake that data.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.326
I bet that wasn't
very hard for you.

34:27.413 --> 34:30.938
Ooh. Gosh, I must be
a very bad man.

34:32.896 --> 34:34.072
Vicious and heartless.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.641
You gave Castro the most
terrifying death possible.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.734
You're evil.

34:44.821 --> 34:46.127
Where's your proof?

34:49.348 --> 34:51.306
- You're gonna confess to me.
- Oh, yeah?

34:51.393 --> 34:53.221
- Yeah.
- Why would I do that?

35:00.402 --> 35:02.274
What, you're gonna scare me
into saying that I did it?

35:02.361 --> 35:03.318
That's your plan?

35:07.148 --> 35:08.497
Yeah, that's the plan.

35:09.672 --> 35:11.326
[dramatic music]

35:14.851 --> 35:16.288
[birds chirping]

35:29.301 --> 35:30.737
Hey.

35:30.824 --> 35:32.391
Good morning,Lisbon.

35:32.478 --> 35:33.914
'Got your message.'

35:35.916 --> 35:37.831
What are you doing here?

35:37.918 --> 35:39.137
Resting.

35:40.399 --> 35:41.965
Solved the case.

35:42.052 --> 35:43.053
Really?

35:43.141 --> 35:44.968
Yeah, it was Benjamin Marx.

35:45.055 --> 35:46.840
He stole the money,
killed Castro

35:46.927 --> 35:48.407
and pinned
the theft on him.

35:48.494 --> 35:51.061
- How do you know that?
- He's gonna confess.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.325
- Gonna confess?
- Mm. Very soon, I think.

35:55.370 --> 35:56.893
Where is he?

35:57.546 --> 35:58.852
Uh..

36:01.246 --> 36:02.812
...he's here.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.382
[Jane]
'Oh. Sorry.'

36:07.469 --> 36:09.471
[grunts]
Somebody help me!

36:09.558 --> 36:12.213
[grunts]
Jane, help me! Please!

36:12.300 --> 36:13.997
Yeah, he-he does go on.

36:15.303 --> 36:17.479
Y-you locked him
in a coffin?

36:17.566 --> 36:20.917
Yeah. Give him a taste
of his own medicine.

36:21.004 --> 36:23.268
Where is he?
How long has he been in there?

36:23.355 --> 36:24.921
We have to get him out.
He'll die.

36:25.008 --> 36:27.489
- Not until he confesses.
- Jane, you can't do this.

36:27.576 --> 36:29.012
Sure, I can.
Watch this.

36:32.015 --> 36:34.540
- Marx, you hear me?
- Jane! Jane, help, me, please.

36:34.627 --> 36:35.802
Please! I can't breathe!

36:35.889 --> 36:38.065
No problem. Just admit
to killing Castro.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.241
[grunts]

36:42.025 --> 36:43.940
- Marx.
- No!

36:45.159 --> 36:46.552
Okay. Die.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.643
Jane, tell me where he is.

36:51.644 --> 36:52.949
I mean it.

36:55.822 --> 36:57.563
- Marx, you change your mind?
- Jane.

36:57.650 --> 37:01.219
Oh, God! Oh! Oh! Oh!

37:01.306 --> 37:02.872
Jane!

37:02.959 --> 37:04.613
Okay, I'm gonna walk away
from here

37:04.700 --> 37:05.962
and no one
will ever find you.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.009
Yes! Yes! Yes!

37:09.096 --> 37:11.794
I did it!
Yeah, I-I killed Antonio.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.579
'You locked him in that box.'

37:13.666 --> 37:15.755
- 'And you left him to die.'
- I did. I did. I did.

37:15.842 --> 37:17.539
Please. Get me out of here.

37:17.626 --> 37:19.106
You must have kept a trophy.
Where is it?

37:19.193 --> 37:21.282
Yes! Okay. Okay. Okay.

37:23.371 --> 37:26.287
His key ring. His key ring.
There's an army insignia on it.

37:26.374 --> 37:30.073
In a box, okay? Top shelf,
bedroom closet. Okay? Please.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.947
Well, there you go.
He's, uh, over by that tree.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.994
I need an ambulance
at the Willow Wood Cemetery

37:38.081 --> 37:39.518
as soon as possible.

37:39.605 --> 37:41.084
God, Jane!

37:44.218 --> 37:45.959
[indistinct police radio
chatter]

37:51.965 --> 37:53.271
What'd you find?

37:54.968 --> 37:56.317
Okay.

37:56.404 --> 37:58.101
[Lisbon]
'Cho said
they found the key ring'

37:58.188 --> 38:00.278
'in the exact place
Marx said it would be.'

38:02.236 --> 38:03.629
'Let's go see Wainwright.'

38:04.847 --> 38:06.196
'Come on.'

38:14.466 --> 38:16.163
You know, I really
can't see the problem.

38:16.250 --> 38:17.686
I closed the case.

38:17.773 --> 38:19.993
You solved what-what case?
There is no case.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.951
No judge is ever gonna let
that confession stand.

38:22.038 --> 38:23.910
They're gonna throw out
the key chain also.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.259
Marx is
never gonna see a trial.

38:25.346 --> 38:27.479
Meh. Let the lawyers
sort it out.

38:27.566 --> 38:29.524
Cho and the accountants
have already found evidence

38:29.611 --> 38:31.047
in Castro's
trading accounts

38:31.134 --> 38:32.875
that it was Marx
who stole the money.

38:32.962 --> 38:35.835
'The DA is gonna charge him
with theft and security fraud.'

38:35.922 --> 38:37.619
Now I think we can build
a murder case

38:37.706 --> 38:39.708
on top of that
without the confession.

38:39.795 --> 38:42.276
- See?
- I don't care.

38:42.363 --> 38:44.104
You assaulted Marx.

38:44.191 --> 38:45.540
Sac PD wants to arrest you.

38:45.627 --> 38:49.239
Marx had a gun.
That's self-defense.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.285
I think a jury
will believe me.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.548
Jane is under a tremendous
amount of stress.

38:53.635 --> 38:55.158
I'm fine, thank you.

38:55.245 --> 38:57.683
Look, you tortured the guy,
for Christ sakes.

38:57.770 --> 39:01.077
Jane, you tortured him.

39:01.164 --> 39:05.212
Do you have any notion
how that makes the CBI look?

39:05.299 --> 39:08.563
I gave an evil psychopath
justice.

39:08.650 --> 39:11.697
Now does anyone here think that
Marx didn't deserve what he got?

39:11.784 --> 39:13.655
I think he deserved it.

39:13.742 --> 39:15.135
Thank you, Grace.
Anyone else?

39:15.222 --> 39:17.790
Cho? Rigsby?

39:17.877 --> 39:20.836
- No, I get it. It's okay.
- Jane, you crossed the line.

39:20.923 --> 39:22.664
Yes, of course I did.
I crossed the line.

39:22.751 --> 39:26.451
I had to to get Marx. It was
the only way to get Marx.

39:26.538 --> 39:27.887
If you don't get the bad guy,
then what's the point

39:27.974 --> 39:29.410
of all this?

39:30.846 --> 39:32.239
I'm not gonna apologize.

39:32.326 --> 39:34.502
Maybe you should take
a time-out.

39:34.589 --> 39:36.199
You know what?
That's a good idea.

39:37.723 --> 39:39.507
You're suspended
as of this moment.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.204
You're not gonna come
into this office.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.903
You're not gonna have
anything to do with the CBI.

39:43.990 --> 39:45.992
There'll be a hearing
on your status in 30 days.

39:49.430 --> 39:52.172
And I want you to know
I'm gonna personally recommend

39:52.259 --> 39:55.349
CBI discontinue you permanently
as a consultant.

39:55.436 --> 39:57.699
I understand that you're under
some distress, Jane

39:59.135 --> 40:01.399
but youshamed us today.

40:03.966 --> 40:05.881
And I'm not gonna
let that happen again.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.495
You're a pathetic little boy.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.020
- Excuse me?
- You're a child.

40:16.196 --> 40:18.677
Daddy was mean to you.
He thought you were soft.

40:18.764 --> 40:19.721
You're a mama's boy.

40:19.808 --> 40:20.983
I'm s..
This has--

40:21.070 --> 40:23.029
Oh, go home, little boy.
Go home to mama.

40:23.116 --> 40:24.334
'Go on. Off to mama.'

40:24.422 --> 40:26.380
- Jane, stop.
- Oh, come on.

40:26.467 --> 40:29.078
'He's a pathetic, little,
mewling mama's boy.'

40:29.165 --> 40:32.168
He's still got her milk
on his lip. Look at him. Huh?

40:32.255 --> 40:33.605
[chuckles]

40:35.345 --> 40:36.738
- Hey! Hey!
- Whoa, boss!

40:36.825 --> 40:37.826
[Cho]
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

40:37.913 --> 40:39.219
Come on. I'm gonna kill you.

40:39.306 --> 40:40.481
- 'Boss.'
- Get off me.

40:40.568 --> 40:42.657
[indistinct chattering]

40:44.485 --> 40:46.269
- Come on!
- Okay. Okay. Get off of me.

40:46.356 --> 40:47.706
Get off of me.

40:48.707 --> 40:50.317
[intense music]

41:08.074 --> 41:11.207
On second thought,
you're not suspended.

41:11.294 --> 41:12.600
You're fired.

41:13.688 --> 41:15.298
Get out of here right now.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.693
[instrumental music]

41:23.176 --> 41:24.482
Jane.

41:29.835 --> 41:31.750
Jane, don't do anything rash.

41:31.837 --> 41:33.447
We can work this out.
We'll fix it.

41:35.014 --> 41:36.755
I doubt that.

41:36.842 --> 41:39.061
I'll come by your place tonight.
We'll talk it out, okay?

41:41.803 --> 41:43.196
You're sweet.

41:44.197 --> 41:45.590
Let me help you.

41:46.678 --> 41:48.331
[elevator bell dings]

41:51.160 --> 41:52.858
[elevator whirring]
