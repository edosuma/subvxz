00:01.869 --> 00:03.347
- Zachary!
- Who is that?

00:03.467 --> 00:05.983
My mom. I don't have time
for a girlfriend right now.

00:06.030 --> 00:08.047
- I'm sorry.
- You don't trust your business partner?

00:08.167 --> 00:09.815
- We're not business partners.
- We could be.

00:09.854 --> 00:12.856
I know you were at school making fake IDs.

00:12.872 --> 00:14.522
Did you steal the e-readers, too? 

00:14.562 --> 00:15.798
Vico did.

00:15.844 --> 00:18.105
I accused Daphne of taking them!

00:18.128 --> 00:20.064
I just... got off my ADHD meds.

00:20.083 --> 00:21.183
Well, that's cool.

00:21.214 --> 00:21.965
Nervous?

00:22.085 --> 00:23.586
Harness that energy and focus.

00:23.611 --> 00:25.187
<i>Focus is key.</i>

00:25.244 --> 00:28.109
I really like you, but I love Lexi.

00:28.503 --> 00:30.380
But I really think we need to break up.

00:30.399 --> 00:32.006
If you're interested in using me as

00:32.012 --> 00:33.583
sperm donor, I'm in.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.521
If you wanna use Timothy,

00:35.555 --> 00:38.323
<i>I think we should get together,
all three of us, talk about it.</i>

00:38.358 --> 00:42.394
The lawyer would like to know if you
two would like to see your father first.

00:42.428 --> 00:45.330
- Oh, we don't.
- You don't have to. But I wanna see my dad.

00:45.365 --> 00:46.665
He has agreed to sign
away his parental rights.

00:46.699 --> 00:48.433
You look just like your mother.

00:58.344 --> 00:59.311
You wanna come in?

01:00.513 --> 01:03.248
No. I, uh...

01:03.283 --> 01:04.683
I just... I wanna know what
you're gonna say to Jude.

01:04.717 --> 01:06.618
What? Whaddaya mean?

01:06.653 --> 01:11.390
Well, when he asks you
why you stopped writing,

01:11.424 --> 01:14.593
and why when you got out
of prison like a year ago,

01:14.627 --> 01:16.295
you didn't even bother to call us...

01:16.329 --> 01:19.631
and don't say that you
think we're better off

01:19.666 --> 01:22.334
without you because we both
know that that is a cop out.

01:22.368 --> 01:25.370
I had to get my life back together, Callie.

01:25.405 --> 01:27.606
Had to get a job, had to...

01:29.342 --> 01:30.642
find a decent place to live.

01:30.677 --> 01:32.344
Before you could even talk to us?

01:32.378 --> 01:34.479
No.

01:34.514 --> 01:36.481
Before I could get you back.

01:38.585 --> 01:41.620
I didn't want this to go down like this.
I wanted to have something to offer you.

01:41.654 --> 01:43.655
It just... it takes time.

01:43.690 --> 01:45.657
I just wanna do right by you kids.

01:45.692 --> 01:46.810
You can't...

01:47.511 --> 01:50.472
You can't say those things to
Jude. You're just gonna confuse him.

01:50.496 --> 01:52.497
Callie, please, you've gotta
give me a chance, Callie...

01:52.532 --> 01:55.500
- Please.
- No, you're too late. No, you're too late.

02:45.351 --> 02:47.319
Hey.

02:47.353 --> 02:50.522
Your dinner's in the oven. How was group?

02:50.556 --> 02:51.690
I didn't go.

02:53.559 --> 02:57.296
I just, um... couldn't deal with it today

02:57.330 --> 02:59.731
so I hung out in the lobby.

02:59.766 --> 03:03.435
I wasn't like playing Candy
Crush or anything, I did homework.

03:03.469 --> 03:05.570
But group is a condition
of your probation, you know.

03:05.605 --> 03:08.573
- She knows.
- Your P.O. is going to get your attendance report.

03:08.608 --> 03:12.644
No, I know. I'm gonna make it
up. I just... had a bad day.

03:12.679 --> 03:14.313
You wanna talk about it?

03:14.347 --> 03:16.381
I'm just hungry. [forced chuckle]

03:36.502 --> 03:39.705
I think this whole thing with
her father signing away his rights

03:39.739 --> 03:41.673
is probably hitting her
pretty hard, you know.

03:41.708 --> 03:45.577
Yeah, well, that's all the more reason for
her to go to group, so she can talk about it.

03:45.611 --> 03:48.680
Well, give her some time. She will.

03:48.715 --> 03:50.716
Not all of us are like you
with your relentless need

03:50.750 --> 03:53.418
to process things the
very second they happens.

03:54.787 --> 03:59.358
Some of us just need a little more
time to figure out how we feel.

04:03.396 --> 04:05.230
What's going on?

04:05.264 --> 04:06.365
I'm moving in.

04:06.399 --> 04:08.567
To Brandon's room? No.
No way. What if I want it?

04:08.601 --> 04:11.336
Too bad. Snoozers are
losers. Get out of my room.

04:11.371 --> 04:12.437
It's not your room!

04:12.472 --> 04:14.306
Hey, hey, what is happening in here?

04:14.340 --> 04:16.641
He's trying to move into Brandon's
room. Like, don't I get a say in this?

04:16.676 --> 04:20.312
It is my room now. I need some
peace and quiet. I can't concentrate!

04:20.346 --> 04:21.613
Well, duh, you have ADHD.

04:21.647 --> 04:25.684
Oh, hey. All right, that is
enough, Mariana. Go to your room.

04:25.718 --> 04:27.519
Thank you.

04:27.553 --> 04:29.621
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- I'm making the bed...

04:29.655 --> 04:32.457
No no no no no. No one is moving in here.

04:32.492 --> 04:34.259
- Go on, get out of here!
- You just told Mariana...

04:34.293 --> 04:37.262
To go back to her room, yes, and
the same applies to you. Go, now.

04:37.296 --> 04:38.497
Fine.

04:38.531 --> 04:40.599
Don't blame me when I fail Algebra.

04:40.633 --> 04:42.367
Really?

04:42.402 --> 04:44.336
[pop music]

04:44.370 --> 04:45.704
[Jude] Hey.

04:49.375 --> 04:51.576
Are... you gonna eat those?

04:57.517 --> 05:00.385
Hey, so I've been thinking, um...

05:00.420 --> 05:03.355
are you sure? Are you
sure you wanna see Dad?

05:05.491 --> 05:07.592
What are you hoping he's gonna say?

05:10.296 --> 05:12.531
I guess I just want a
chance to say goodbye.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.602
But what if he doesn't...
say goodbye, I mean... ?

05:19.672 --> 05:23.642
What if he says, like, he wants
to get us back or something?

05:25.478 --> 05:28.313
He won't, but if he did,
what would you think?

05:29.582 --> 05:33.385
I don't know. I mean, he is our dad.

05:42.794 --> 05:45.629
- He up yet?
- He's in the shower.

05:45.663 --> 05:49.733
So listen, uh... I wanted to thank
you for the money and everything.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.702
And I want you to know
that I'm gonna pay you back.

05:51.736 --> 05:54.605
I promise. I'm gonna get a job, or...

05:54.639 --> 05:56.440
School is your job.

05:56.474 --> 05:58.442
Let's just say the money was a gift?

05:58.476 --> 06:01.478
- Are you serious?
- Totally.

06:01.513 --> 06:04.281
Makes me happy to help you out.

06:04.315 --> 06:06.617
I do have one request, though.

06:06.651 --> 06:08.418
You need to start playing piano again.

06:08.453 --> 06:10.254
Sure.

06:10.288 --> 06:13.257
So get to it.

06:13.291 --> 06:16.460
- Right now?
- Come on, play for the cook.

06:16.494 --> 06:18.462
Ok.

06:32.410 --> 06:35.412
- Hey.
- Shh shh.

06:35.446 --> 06:37.281
Sorry.

06:37.315 --> 06:40.450
Wow. How'd you make this happen?

06:40.485 --> 06:42.753
He hasn't touched that
thing since he moved in.

06:42.787 --> 06:45.422
Maybe I'm a good influence.

06:45.456 --> 06:48.392
[piano playing continues]

06:48.426 --> 06:49.726
So, um... [clears throat]

06:49.761 --> 06:53.397
I've been thinking about
our talk the other night,

06:53.431 --> 06:57.367
you know, you moving in, and you're right.

06:57.402 --> 07:02.539
Brandon probably has resented
sharing Stef and Lena all this time...

07:02.574 --> 07:06.543
you know, with the twins and
now Callie and Jude and...

07:08.646 --> 07:11.649
I just don't want him to feel
like he has to share me, too.

07:12.283 --> 07:15.319
You know. Not right now.

07:15.353 --> 07:17.454
Yeah, of course.

07:17.488 --> 07:22.222
No, you're right. You're 100% right.

07:22.257 --> 07:26.593
It's not that I don't appreciate
everything you're doing. I do.

07:26.628 --> 07:31.365
Just maybe when he moves back to his mom's

07:31.399 --> 07:33.567
we can... revisit the idea.

07:33.601 --> 07:37.404
Yeah, of course.

07:37.438 --> 07:38.639
Ok.

07:47.715 --> 07:49.550
Oh-oh, bad news?

07:49.584 --> 07:53.287
If you consider getting kissed and
dumped on the same day bad news.

07:53.321 --> 07:56.423
Well, you didn't give him
your underwear, too, did you?

07:56.457 --> 07:58.458
Relax, I'm kidding. [chuckles]

07:58.526 --> 08:02.529
Since I moved to Dad's, I
don't get to tease you as much.

08:02.564 --> 08:04.364
Kinda my job as a big brother.

08:04.399 --> 08:06.333
Yeah, well, we miss you, too.

08:06.367 --> 08:10.337
How is everyone? How's Callie?
Is she happy to be home?

08:10.371 --> 08:13.307
She is. How about you,
how's life in the man cave?

08:13.341 --> 08:15.309
I'm on lock down.

08:15.343 --> 08:16.643
Why?

08:16.678 --> 08:21.481
I told my dad about the
piano money and everything.

08:21.516 --> 08:25.218
Ouch. Well, it sucks you're
grounded, but to be honest,

08:25.253 --> 08:27.487
I'm a little relieved that
Mike's isn't all fun and games,

08:27.522 --> 08:31.491
'cause then you'd never want to come home.
I mean, you are gonna move back, right?

08:31.526 --> 08:35.227
- Definitely.
- Good, 'cause Jesus is eyeing your room.

08:35.263 --> 08:37.597
If you don't come soon, you might
not have a room to come home to.

08:37.631 --> 08:40.534
- [scoffs]
- Don't be a stranger.

08:40.602 --> 08:43.604
[school bell rings]

08:46.574 --> 08:48.375
Foster, you ok?

08:48.409 --> 08:50.243
I don't get this crap.

08:50.278 --> 08:54.314
If I fail this midterm, I'm totally
getting kicked off the wrestling team.

08:54.349 --> 08:55.482
Haven't you been studying?

08:55.516 --> 08:56.650
I'm tryin'.

08:56.684 --> 08:59.286
I'm sure it's tough with Lexi in town.

08:59.320 --> 09:03.223
Lexi left. We broke up.

09:03.257 --> 09:05.292
Oh, yeah?

09:05.326 --> 09:07.427
She hooked up with some guy in Honduras.

09:10.465 --> 09:13.433
Hey, do you think maybe you and
me could study together tonight?

09:13.468 --> 09:16.303
Um...

09:16.337 --> 09:18.605
Yeah... I don't think I can.

09:20.575 --> 09:22.275
Sorry.

09:24.612 --> 09:26.413
I need my own room.

09:26.447 --> 09:29.282
Need? Really? Well I need
One Direction tickets.

09:29.317 --> 09:30.584
I'm pretty that's not gonna happen either.

09:30.618 --> 09:33.253
Come on. What is it gonna take
for you to help me convince Moms

09:33.287 --> 09:34.621
that I should get Brandon's room?

09:36.658 --> 09:40.193
- Tommy, I'll have that.
- Whatever.

09:40.228 --> 09:41.595
Jesus.

09:41.629 --> 09:44.264
So if I do your chores for a week?

09:45.263 --> 09:49.199
A week? Oh hells no. Six months.

09:49.233 --> 09:51.168
Six months? Are you insane.

09:51.202 --> 09:54.237
I'm not gonna be your slave. One month.

09:54.272 --> 09:55.439
Four.

09:55.473 --> 09:56.607
One.

09:56.641 --> 09:58.542
Mmmm... no, I don't think so.

09:58.576 --> 10:01.211
Two months.

10:01.245 --> 10:02.579
Then you've got to go
to bat for me with Moms.

10:05.316 --> 10:07.551
Sucker. I would've done
it for one. [chuckles]

10:09.220 --> 10:10.554
Oh God.

10:10.588 --> 10:13.423
- Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
- What?

10:13.458 --> 10:15.540
It's Zac's mom. I'm
pretty sure she hates me.

10:15.541 --> 10:17.165
Please, don't leave me alone with her.

10:17.328 --> 10:19.529
Yeah, good luck, sucker.

10:21.299 --> 10:23.400
You're Mariana, right?

10:24.435 --> 10:26.269
I'm Amanda Rogers, Zac's mom.

10:26.304 --> 10:28.538
Is Zac ok? He was home sick, right?

10:29.641 --> 10:31.541
Lovesick's more like it.

10:32.644 --> 10:35.479
And I think that what he really needs is,

10:35.513 --> 10:37.648
um, a little cheering up.

10:40.251 --> 10:43.620
And just so you know, I
just had my annual physical

10:43.655 --> 10:49.359
and got tested for, you know,
everything and all clear.

10:49.394 --> 10:52.629
What? This is a primal need
for you to spread your seed?

10:52.664 --> 10:53.664
Honey.

10:53.698 --> 10:55.432
What, I just... I'm curious

10:55.466 --> 10:59.469
why he would want to
donate in the first place.

10:59.504 --> 11:03.206
I guess that could seem
a little odd to you.

11:03.241 --> 11:05.342
Um...

11:05.376 --> 11:07.577
Very few people find it in their hearts

11:07.612 --> 11:10.447
to open their homes to foster children,

11:10.481 --> 11:13.550
not to mention the "high risk" ones.

11:13.584 --> 11:17.187
You're the kind of parents that should
be bringing kids into this world, so...

11:17.221 --> 11:18.422
Good answer.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.628
Um, you'll, uh, you'll sign a contract?

11:24.662 --> 11:26.630
What sort of contract? I didn't...

11:26.664 --> 11:30.300
Well, basically that says
we're the parents, not you.

11:30.334 --> 11:33.236
Um, yeah, yeah, of course.

11:33.271 --> 11:35.472
And we all agree that
anonymity is best, yeah?

11:35.506 --> 11:38.408
- [Timothy] Absolutely.
- [Lena] Right now we don't want anyone,

11:38.443 --> 11:41.344
mostly our kids to know that it's you,

11:41.379 --> 11:43.180
especially while they're your students.

11:43.214 --> 11:46.249
Yeah, got it. Right, good thinking.

11:46.284 --> 11:49.519
So are we... are we doing this?

11:53.658 --> 11:56.259
- Yeah.
- [sighs]

11:59.097 --> 12:01.666
Mom? What are you... ?

12:01.700 --> 12:03.034
Hi.

12:03.068 --> 12:05.870
I... I was visiting your beautiful Mama.

12:05.904 --> 12:09.774
Hmm. Romance at lunch.
Nice. Way to up your game.

12:09.841 --> 12:12.076
I... I don't need more game.

12:14.680 --> 12:15.946
I've got plenty of game.

12:15.981 --> 12:18.883
Zac's mom invited me
over for dinner tonight.

12:18.917 --> 12:20.751
Is it ok if I eat there?

12:20.786 --> 12:22.653
I promise I'll be home early. Please.

12:22.654 --> 12:23.454
That's not the problem. We just...

12:23.458 --> 12:26.090
We were planning on inviting
B over for dinner tonight.

12:26.124 --> 12:29.694
There's a couple of things we
want to talk to you guys about.

12:29.728 --> 12:31.095
What about? Is everything ok?

12:31.129 --> 12:33.831
Nothing's wrong, just a kind of a...

12:33.865 --> 12:35.833
you know, how's-everybody-doing

12:35.867 --> 12:38.035
check in/update kinda thing.
Sort of a team meeting.

12:38.070 --> 12:39.922
Well, have you talked to Mike about that?

12:39.923 --> 12:42.169
Because Team Member Brandon is grounded.

12:44.710 --> 12:45.876
He's grounded?

12:45.911 --> 12:49.714
[rock music playing]

13:02.729 --> 13:03.863
You couldn't even answer my texts?

13:03.897 --> 13:05.998
I have a limited data plan.

13:06.033 --> 13:08.701
Oh, come on.

13:08.735 --> 13:11.737
Ok, I know what I did sucks.

13:11.772 --> 13:14.740
You asked me to forgive you once.

13:14.775 --> 13:16.809
How about you return the favor?

13:16.843 --> 13:18.978
Why you even want to be friends?

13:19.012 --> 13:22.848
The only thing we have in common
is Girls United and that's history.

13:22.883 --> 13:25.718
Well, history means something to me.

13:27.654 --> 13:28.921
Not like I have that much of it.

13:28.955 --> 13:31.590
So what happens the next
time something goes missing?

13:31.625 --> 13:32.992
I'm always gonna be a thief
or a drug dealer to you.

13:33.026 --> 13:35.861
No, that's not true.

13:35.896 --> 13:38.631
I'm sorry. Ok, really.

13:38.665 --> 13:41.600
I know what it's like to
be judged for your past.

13:41.635 --> 13:44.637
And I know, you and I don't
have exactly the same background.

13:44.671 --> 13:47.873
But it's not like I belong
at Anchor Beach either,

13:47.908 --> 13:52.611
with girls who ugly cry when their
Facebook photos don't get enough "likes".

13:52.646 --> 13:53.746
I'm not kidding.

13:58.985 --> 13:59.985
I saw my dad.

14:04.791 --> 14:09.628
Look, I know how bad it feels to be out
of the loop when it comes to our son.

14:09.663 --> 14:11.731
It's how I've felt the past
ten years, but I had to trust

14:11.765 --> 14:13.733
that you and Lena were always looking out

14:13.767 --> 14:15.735
for B's best interest,
now you have to trust me.

14:15.769 --> 14:18.838
You must be loving this. Your chance
to turn the tables on us, isn't it?

14:18.872 --> 14:21.006
I'm not loving this.

14:21.041 --> 14:24.910
This isn't about me, this isn't
a game, Stef. It's about our son.

14:24.978 --> 14:29.782
Look, ever since Callie came to live
with you guys, Brandon's been acting out.

14:29.816 --> 14:31.717
- Oh, really, ok.
- Yes.

14:31.752 --> 14:32.740
And the good news is,

14:32.741 --> 14:35.374
that he came clean about the
money and gave it all back.

14:36.656 --> 14:39.692
He's talking to me, he trusts me.

14:39.726 --> 14:41.660
He's back on the right track.

14:41.695 --> 14:42.895
I think living here is great for him.

14:42.929 --> 14:45.731
Brandon may be living under your roof,

14:45.766 --> 14:49.935
but I am still his mother, and
technically, Mike, legally, I have custody.

14:49.970 --> 14:51.971
I'm well aware of that, Stef.

14:52.005 --> 14:53.870
I will not be kept out of the loop

14:53.871 --> 14:56.458
when it comes to what
is going on with my son.

14:56.843 --> 15:01.680
I need to be consulted about
every decision regarding him.

15:01.715 --> 15:03.716
- Ok.
- Thank you.

15:07.921 --> 15:10.956
- [door shuts loudly]
- [sighs]

15:10.991 --> 15:12.892
I thought you handled that really well.

15:12.926 --> 15:15.828
But, listen, if he's
gonna move out eventually,

15:15.862 --> 15:19.565
isn't it better to just do it
now before we upset everyone?

15:19.599 --> 15:22.835
I mean, it's not like Stef's
ever gonna give up control.

15:22.869 --> 15:24.003
No.

15:24.037 --> 15:26.705
You know what?

15:26.740 --> 15:29.675
Brandon's happy here, he's doing great.

15:29.709 --> 15:32.044
I'm not gonna let Stef manipulate me again.

15:35.882 --> 15:39.585
You're right. You're totally right.

15:39.619 --> 15:42.588
He's a young man now
and he needs his father.

15:44.090 --> 15:46.959
- Guess what?
- What?

15:46.993 --> 15:48.627
I'm ovulating!

15:50.764 --> 15:55.601
Wow! Whoa. That's... wow, ok.

15:55.635 --> 15:58.704
But we still have to have the contract
drawn up and Timothy has to sign it.

15:58.738 --> 16:01.807
I hear you, but we both know, my
hormone levels could drop at any moment.

16:01.842 --> 16:04.009
- Do we really want to take that chance?
- Uh...

16:04.044 --> 16:05.778
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:05.812 --> 16:09.582
- So I talked to Mariana and it's all good.
- Uh, what's all good?

16:09.616 --> 16:11.951
- She's cool with me moving into Brandon's room.
- [chuckles]

16:11.985 --> 16:14.887
- I didn't realize that was up for discussion.
- It's not.

16:14.921 --> 16:16.555
What? Why not?

16:16.590 --> 16:18.791
Because it's Brandon's room
and he's coming home soon.

16:18.825 --> 16:19.959
When?

16:19.993 --> 16:22.661
I don't know, sweetheart
but it's gonna be soon.

16:22.696 --> 16:27.700
And when he does, his room's
gonna be waiting for him. Got it?

16:27.734 --> 16:31.003
So I get a half of one room
and Brandon gets two rooms.

16:31.037 --> 16:34.940
It's great, just great. You
always put Golden Boy first.

16:34.975 --> 16:37.009
Oh.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.781
All right, you know what?

16:42.816 --> 16:44.683
I think maybe you're right.

16:44.718 --> 16:48.654
We should just wait until
next month to, um, inseminate.

16:51.057 --> 16:52.791
[sighs]

16:52.826 --> 16:54.860
Look, sit. Sit sit sit.

16:57.998 --> 16:59.865
You always put everyone else first.

16:59.900 --> 17:01.934
Let's not wait.

17:01.968 --> 17:04.737
Let's do it now, ok?

17:04.771 --> 17:08.607
As long as the contract is signed
before the baby is born, it's all good.

17:09.809 --> 17:13.579
- [sighs] Are you sure?
- Yeah.

17:13.613 --> 17:16.949
But can we just, um...

17:16.983 --> 17:20.853
maybe wait to tell the kids until we are
actually pregnant? That would be great.

17:20.887 --> 17:22.922
[both laugh]

17:22.955 --> 17:28.694
If he was trying to get us
back, why not at least call us?

17:28.728 --> 17:31.597
I mean, he's been out of prison a year.

17:31.631 --> 17:33.933
How long does it take to get your act
together when your kids are at stake?

17:33.967 --> 17:35.868
It can take longer than you think.

17:35.902 --> 17:37.570
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

17:37.604 --> 17:39.038
It's hard enough trying to
get a good job out of juvie,

17:39.072 --> 17:40.940
let alone outta prison like your dad.

17:40.974 --> 17:43.609
Well, you're nothing like my dad.

17:46.012 --> 17:48.847
How was it? Seeing him, I mean?

17:48.882 --> 17:50.783
Weird.

17:50.817 --> 17:54.887
I thought I was just gonna
tell him to leave us alone.

17:54.921 --> 17:58.824
I thought, "You're the
reason that Mom's dead"

17:58.858 --> 18:02.728
and then you basically
abandoned us, so screw you."

18:03.863 --> 18:08.701
And then he opened the
door, and there he was...

18:08.735 --> 18:09.735
my dad.

18:11.671 --> 18:14.707
He was never a great dad.

18:14.741 --> 18:16.909
He wasn't really around all
that much when we were kids.

18:18.778 --> 18:19.945
But he was still my dad.

18:23.016 --> 18:27.953
I just don't want him confusing Jude
with all this bull about wanting us back.

18:29.923 --> 18:32.024
Sounds to me like Jude's
not the one who's confused.

18:47.423 --> 18:49.624
What're you... doing here?

18:49.658 --> 18:52.493
Your mom invited me. I hope that's cool.

18:52.528 --> 18:55.129
You brought me flowers?

18:55.164 --> 18:57.565
Oh, no no, these are for...

18:57.600 --> 19:00.535
Mariana! Oh, you made it!

19:00.569 --> 19:01.569
For you, Mrs. Rogers.

19:01.604 --> 19:05.240
Oh, they're beautiful. Thank you.

19:05.274 --> 19:09.577
And stop calling me Mrs. Rogers.
I mean it, it makes me feel old.

19:09.612 --> 19:12.146
Come on in. Welcome.

19:13.349 --> 19:15.149
Be a gentleman.

19:15.184 --> 19:17.452
[soft rock music playing]

19:19.455 --> 19:22.156
I hope you like garlic. Here we go.

19:23.492 --> 19:25.393
Oh my goodness, this
all looks so delicious.

19:25.427 --> 19:27.528
Oh. aren't you a love.

19:27.563 --> 19:29.631
How come you never brought her over before?

19:29.665 --> 19:33.635
Well, technically, I didn't
bring her over this time.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.405
So tell me about you.

19:37.439 --> 19:39.507
Well, um... I did costumes

19:39.541 --> 19:42.377
- for the play that Zac was...
- Oh!

19:42.411 --> 19:45.413
I love this song! [giggles]

19:48.484 --> 19:52.387
- Get up and dance with me.
- What, no, Mom, not...

19:52.421 --> 19:55.356
Zachary! Come on! Come on! Get
up right now! Come on. Come on.

19:55.391 --> 19:56.557
You know I hate it when you call me that.

20:00.663 --> 20:04.666
Right. Sorry. Sorry.

20:04.700 --> 20:07.568
Mom, I'm sorry, can we just please eat?

20:07.603 --> 20:10.471
Sure. Sure we can. Of course.

20:12.408 --> 20:15.310
This looks delicious. Who made this?

20:17.646 --> 20:19.280
You did, Mom.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.651
Of course I did. I was joking!

20:25.387 --> 20:28.289
You kids never get my jokes.

20:30.726 --> 20:33.328
Do you ever wish you had a dad?

20:33.362 --> 20:37.699
Everyone has a dad,
I've just never met mine.

20:37.733 --> 20:40.401
I miss my mom.

20:40.436 --> 20:42.503
I don't really remember my dad.

20:42.538 --> 20:46.307
Hey. I heard he's gonna let us adopt
you guys. That's good news, right?

20:46.342 --> 20:47.608
Yeah.

20:49.311 --> 20:51.245
I'm supposed to see him soon.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.714
You are? Why?

20:54.450 --> 20:57.251
They asked us if we
wanted to and I said I did.

21:04.259 --> 21:07.195
Just be careful, ok?

21:07.229 --> 21:09.297
You remember what happened with me and Ana.

21:14.570 --> 21:17.505
Hey. Come on in.

21:24.446 --> 21:26.514
I'm kinda surprised you came back.

21:26.548 --> 21:30.518
Does your... your foster
family, they know you're here?

21:30.552 --> 21:33.588
No, they think I'm working
on a project for school.

21:33.622 --> 21:35.176
[chuckles]

21:35.177 --> 21:38.275
You want something to drink?
You want me to get you something?

21:38.276 --> 21:40.395
Um, why'd you stop writing to us?

21:51.407 --> 21:56.277
You know, after you've been in prison
for a couple of years, you, uh...

21:56.311 --> 21:58.246
you start to think maybe
you're not gonna get out.

21:58.280 --> 22:01.482
I told myself you kids were better off.

22:01.517 --> 22:04.252
Truth is, I was pretty messed up.

22:06.255 --> 22:09.424
And I felt ashamed about what I'd done.

22:11.460 --> 22:14.562
And I was just waiting for the day to
come when I'd open up a letter from you...

22:16.665 --> 22:18.533
accusing me of murdering your mother.

22:18.567 --> 22:20.635
You didn't... murder her.

22:20.669 --> 22:23.538
Yeah, I did.

22:25.374 --> 22:28.676
I got drunk, I got behind
the wheel, she's dead.

22:28.710 --> 22:32.380
I mean, I didn't use a gun,

22:32.414 --> 22:34.382
but it all added up the same.

22:36.452 --> 22:38.553
Oh. Ok.

22:38.587 --> 22:41.522
- Oh, I don't think I should.
- Oh, don't be silly.

22:41.557 --> 22:46.527
In Europe, everybody lets their kids
have a little nip or two now and then.

22:46.562 --> 22:48.596
Here we go.

22:48.630 --> 22:52.266
I... wanna make a toast.

22:54.470 --> 22:57.538
Today is the two-year anniversary

22:57.573 --> 23:00.208
of the day your father walked out on me.

23:00.242 --> 23:02.276
Best thing that ever happened to me.

23:02.311 --> 23:03.311
Cheers!

23:05.214 --> 23:07.482
Mom, dad left ten years ago.

23:09.685 --> 23:13.254
I know, but it feels like two.

23:15.290 --> 23:18.326
Son of a bitch. Good riddance.

23:22.498 --> 23:25.433
Well, now you know.

23:25.467 --> 23:28.202
- Know what?
- [distant clattering]

23:28.237 --> 23:32.473
How weird my mom is.

23:32.508 --> 23:34.242
So?

23:35.544 --> 23:37.308
Is this why you didn't
wanna go out with me?

23:37.909 --> 23:38.791
'Cause of your mom?

23:42.351 --> 23:46.487
- Oh my God, Zac, I love her.
- [snickers]

23:46.522 --> 23:49.524
She's funny and she's fun and,

23:49.558 --> 23:52.593
ok, yeah she's a little kooky, but so what?

23:52.628 --> 23:55.463
I like kooky. I mean, I like you, don't I?

24:12.447 --> 24:13.581
Hey.

24:13.615 --> 24:14.649
What's going on?

24:14.683 --> 24:16.317
Surprise!

24:16.351 --> 24:18.519
I know that you're into blue,

24:18.554 --> 24:22.290
but I didn't know which shade so...

24:24.560 --> 24:25.626
Where did you get this?

24:25.661 --> 24:28.596
Someone told me The Weepies
is your favorite band.

24:28.630 --> 24:30.598
That's amazing, thank you. [chuckles]

24:30.632 --> 24:36.203
Your dad and I want you to feel
at home here, with a grown up room.

24:36.238 --> 24:38.339
Oh, and I hope you don't mind, but

24:38.373 --> 24:40.374
<i>that old Space Buddies bedding had to go.</i>

24:40.409 --> 24:42.510
[chuckles]

24:42.544 --> 24:44.211
You didn't have to do this.

24:44.246 --> 24:46.447
Are you kidding? I love a makeover.

24:46.481 --> 24:48.316
And no offense, but this apartment

24:48.350 --> 24:50.618
is where old black leather
couches come to die.

24:50.652 --> 24:53.354
I just mean that, you know,

24:53.388 --> 24:56.357
I'm not gonna be here forever.

24:57.426 --> 25:00.428
[scoffs] Brandon...

25:00.462 --> 25:03.297
do you really think that
you're gonna feel comfortable,

25:03.332 --> 25:06.467
living in that house with Callie?

25:06.501 --> 25:08.235
Personally,

25:08.270 --> 25:12.273
I think that whole thing
was handled really poorly.

25:12.307 --> 25:13.608
I mean, she's not your sister.

25:15.377 --> 25:19.246
You met, what, like a few months ago?

25:19.281 --> 25:21.215
And if you're not living
under the same roof,

25:21.249 --> 25:24.185
I just... I don't see why you
couldn't have a relationship with her.

25:24.219 --> 25:26.420
I mean, if that's what you both want.

25:26.455 --> 25:28.522
[nervous chuckle]

25:28.557 --> 25:30.524
Yeah, I...

25:30.559 --> 25:33.628
I don't think my dad would
be very down with that.

25:33.662 --> 25:36.497
[scoffs] Honey,

25:36.531 --> 25:40.368
leave him to me. He's down
with more than you know.

25:45.307 --> 25:48.409
So what about you?

25:48.443 --> 25:50.311
What about me?

25:51.346 --> 25:54.582
Well... how've you been?

25:54.616 --> 25:57.351
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

25:57.386 --> 25:59.420
Um, pretty awful.

25:59.454 --> 26:03.457
Jude and I have been in
six different foster homes.

26:03.492 --> 26:06.327
They've all basically
sucked until this one.

26:12.434 --> 26:15.302
And I went to juvie a
couple of times myself,

26:15.337 --> 26:20.408
Really? Juvie? You were such a good girl.

26:23.679 --> 26:25.279
What?

26:25.313 --> 26:28.549
No, you just... you just
rubbed your nose like...

26:28.583 --> 26:31.652
It takes me back.

26:31.687 --> 26:33.654
When you were a little kid,
you used to rub your nose

26:33.689 --> 26:36.390
and suck your thumb to
help you go to sleep.

26:36.425 --> 26:39.427
Your mom and I thought
we broke you of the habit.

26:43.732 --> 26:48.402
Callie, I know, I know,

26:48.437 --> 26:51.539
I failed you and Jude in...

26:51.573 --> 26:54.341
every way a man can possibly fail his kids,

26:54.376 --> 26:56.444
and I know this happened all wrong.

26:56.478 --> 27:01.148
You weren't supposed to show
up at my door, looking for me.

27:01.183 --> 27:03.617
I wanna tell you something now, ok?

27:03.652 --> 27:08.155
And you can take this to the bank.

27:10.592 --> 27:12.259
I am here for you now.

27:15.363 --> 27:17.465
Ok, I know I'm out of time,

27:17.499 --> 27:21.335
and I don't want to confuse
Jude any more than you do,

27:21.369 --> 27:24.205
so just...

27:24.239 --> 27:26.240
I'll tell him whatever you want me to.

27:28.677 --> 27:31.479
I want you to tell him the truth.

27:45.616 --> 27:47.751
It's your turn to take out
the garbage cans, please.

27:47.785 --> 27:49.886
Oh, Jesus is gonna do that for me.

27:49.921 --> 27:51.421
Mmm, no I'm not.

27:51.456 --> 27:53.457
[Mariana] Um, we made a deal.

27:53.491 --> 27:55.592
Well, deal didn't work, so it's off.

27:55.626 --> 27:57.361
[groans] you suck.

27:57.395 --> 27:58.528
Hey.

28:00.498 --> 28:05.635
So I'm not sure if I want
to see my dad anymore.

28:05.670 --> 28:08.572
Well, it's normal to be nervous, honey.

28:08.606 --> 28:11.541
It's not that.

28:11.576 --> 28:15.479
I just... I don't know if I want to.

28:16.814 --> 28:19.716
I think you should.

28:19.751 --> 28:23.487
I think we both should.
Just hear him out at least.

28:23.521 --> 28:25.555
Did you have a change of heart, Callie?

28:25.590 --> 28:28.525
- [Callie] Yeah, I guess.
- I think that's great, Callie.

28:28.559 --> 28:30.594
And Jude, you know, I know it's tough,

28:30.628 --> 28:33.663
but if you don't see him,
you might regret it later.

28:33.698 --> 28:36.400
I'll be with you.

28:37.568 --> 28:41.538
If we're gonna be together... ok.

28:41.572 --> 28:44.408
[Lena] Ok, great.

28:44.442 --> 28:47.411
So why don't you guys grab your
stuff, we're gonna be late for school.

28:53.818 --> 28:55.786
Hey, um...

28:56.788 --> 29:00.357
I just want you both to know

29:00.391 --> 29:01.625
how much Jude and I love you.

29:02.794 --> 29:04.494
We know that, honey.

29:04.529 --> 29:07.464
And nothing's could ever change that.

29:07.498 --> 29:09.533
We love you, too.

29:13.838 --> 29:15.806
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:15.840 --> 29:19.509
So Mariana told me about tomorrow, big day.

29:19.544 --> 29:20.844
You finally get to see
your dad. You nervous?

29:20.878 --> 29:25.382
I mean, you haven't seen
him in like what, six years?

29:25.416 --> 29:27.651
I saw him last night.

29:27.685 --> 29:30.787
You did? Why?

29:30.822 --> 29:35.492
I mean, I thought he already
agreed to sign away his rights.

29:35.526 --> 29:39.529
Well, he will, if that's
what Jude and I want.

29:39.564 --> 29:42.799
Well, it is what you want, isn't it?

29:42.834 --> 29:46.603
You're not seriously considering
going to live with him or something?

29:46.637 --> 29:48.872
- It's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

29:48.906 --> 29:52.576
Callie, you can't keep changing
your mind about what you want.

29:52.610 --> 29:54.778
He didn't try to call you
when he got out of jail.

29:54.812 --> 29:56.613
There are reasons.

29:56.647 --> 29:57.848
- No, there are no good ones!
- Brandon, stop it!

29:57.882 --> 30:00.617
And now you and Jude have a
family who wants to adopt you

30:00.685 --> 30:02.853
who loves you and what, he
suddenly he wants you back?

30:02.887 --> 30:04.855
- You really think he cares?
- Stop it! Stop it!

30:04.889 --> 30:07.858
He abandoned you and Jude.
That's not what a father does.

30:07.892 --> 30:10.527
Don't tell me about my father.

30:11.596 --> 30:12.896
Callie!

30:15.766 --> 30:18.802
This is worse than the time we
built that volcano for Mariana.

30:18.836 --> 30:21.805
- Well, hello.
- Those aren't for us.

30:21.839 --> 30:23.440
- What!
- They're for Timothy.

30:23.474 --> 30:25.542
Oh, come on, he gets to have all the fun.

30:25.576 --> 30:27.477
Yeah, well, we get a baby.

30:27.512 --> 30:29.513
That is if we can figure
out how to use this kit.

30:29.547 --> 30:34.484
My Brandon-making kit was a bottle of
whiskey and the backseat of Mike's car.

30:34.519 --> 30:35.585
I shouldn't have said that, should I?

30:36.654 --> 30:39.789
So where exactly do you want Timothy to,

30:39.824 --> 30:41.825
you know, do his... ?

30:41.859 --> 30:44.761
Well, I thought... our bathroom.

30:44.795 --> 30:47.864
I mean, time really is of the essence here,

30:47.899 --> 30:49.866
so I thought, you know, he could leave it

30:49.901 --> 30:53.537
and we can run right in and do our thing.

30:53.571 --> 30:55.405
Ok.

30:55.439 --> 30:58.408
- Wow. Look at this.
- Honey.

31:03.514 --> 31:05.549
[people chattering]

31:11.622 --> 31:13.456
- Hey.
- [school bell rings]

31:13.491 --> 31:16.726
I'm sorry I couldn't help
you study yesterday. I just...

31:16.761 --> 31:18.562
It's... it's fine.

31:19.931 --> 31:23.833
I heard the mid-term is gonna
cover powers, roots, and radicals.

31:23.868 --> 31:26.603
No polynomials, thank God!

31:27.838 --> 31:29.739
If you want, we can cram at lunch.

31:29.774 --> 31:32.642
I can't. I've got to go home,
I've gotta grab something.

31:33.811 --> 31:35.845
So no one's here so you
can just take your time.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.447
I always do.

31:37.481 --> 31:39.449
[chuckles]

31:41.652 --> 31:44.554
Um, you don't... you don't have to fill
the whole thing, it's... that's good.

31:45.756 --> 31:48.758
Um, you, shouldn't use any lotion

31:48.793 --> 31:52.696
or anything like that and,
uh... and we did leave some...

31:52.730 --> 31:55.498
some reading material for
you in case you need it.

31:55.533 --> 31:58.635
Oh. Well. Thanks.

31:58.669 --> 32:01.471
Oh, so our room is at the top of the stairs

32:01.505 --> 32:04.474
and you'll find everything
you need in the bathroom.

32:04.508 --> 32:07.510
And we'll just wait out back.

32:18.689 --> 32:20.423
[both snicker]

32:20.458 --> 32:21.625
Come on.

32:21.659 --> 32:23.627
Shh.

32:29.767 --> 32:31.601
This is crazy.

32:32.803 --> 32:34.738
Right?

32:34.772 --> 32:36.840
We're gonna have a baby.

32:40.811 --> 32:43.446
- I love you.
- I love you.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.701
- Timothy?
- Hey.

33:37.735 --> 33:40.437
What are you doing here?

33:40.471 --> 33:43.506
I was just having a parent/teacher
conference with your moms.

33:43.541 --> 33:45.542
At your home.

33:45.609 --> 33:48.745
And um, I just needed to
use the bathroom, so...

33:49.914 --> 33:51.781
I'll see you at school.

33:58.689 --> 34:00.757
Um... Jesus is here.

34:11.601 --> 34:13.870
Moms!

34:16.806 --> 34:18.775
I just found a cup...

34:18.809 --> 34:21.444
- We know, honey.
- You know?

34:21.478 --> 34:24.447
I think we might wanna tell the kids now.

34:25.783 --> 34:27.884
Tell us what?

34:29.685 --> 34:32.282
So... we were going to wait until later,

34:32.283 --> 34:33.679
to tell you guys this,

34:33.688 --> 34:36.958
but since the cat's outta the bag...

34:39.761 --> 34:40.895
we are trying to have a baby.

34:40.929 --> 34:43.030
What... adopt a baby?

34:43.065 --> 34:46.967
Oh my God, a baby! We've never had
one of those. Please get a girl!

34:47.002 --> 34:50.571
- Wait, wait, there's more.
- We're not gonna adopt.

34:50.606 --> 34:52.773
Mama wants to carry the baby.

34:52.808 --> 34:55.909
We've decided to give it
a try. And we have a donor.

34:55.944 --> 34:57.812
It's Timothy.

34:57.846 --> 35:01.716
Timothy, as in our English teacher Timothy?

35:01.750 --> 35:03.951
We wanted it to be
anonymous, but your brother...

35:03.986 --> 35:06.053
Basically walked in on
Timothy in Moms' bathroom...

35:06.088 --> 35:08.856
Ok, look, none of this is easy, you guys,

35:08.890 --> 35:12.827
but we just... we wanted someone that
we knew and trusted and respected.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.662
And who would make a
freaking adorable baby.

35:14.730 --> 35:17.798
So that's why I can't have Brandon's room?

35:17.833 --> 35:18.833
You're turning it into a nursery?

35:18.867 --> 35:21.035
If Mama gets pregnant, uh,

35:21.069 --> 35:24.639
the baby will sleep in our bedroom.

35:24.673 --> 35:27.875
We want all of you to
be on board with this.

35:27.909 --> 35:31.879
Ok, it's really really important to Mama.

35:36.084 --> 35:38.686
- I think it's cool.
- Yeah, me too.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.655
Me three.

35:40.689 --> 35:43.791
And, Jesus, if you want to
move into my room, it's yours.

35:43.825 --> 35:46.027
- [Jesus] For real?
- [Brandon] Yeah.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.695
Are you sure about that, bud?

35:47.729 --> 35:51.666
I mean, you know, until I get back, ok?

35:51.700 --> 35:53.567
- Can I start moving in?
- Go.

35:53.602 --> 35:56.003
Ooh, but after, you need
to take the trash bins in

35:56.038 --> 35:58.973
from the curb. A deal's a deal.

36:01.677 --> 36:02.977
[Mariana] Oh, my God, I'm so excited.

36:03.011 --> 36:04.812
You're seeing your dad, right?

36:04.846 --> 36:06.047
Yeah, tomorrow.

36:06.131 --> 36:08.699
I hope that turns out the way you want.

36:12.871 --> 36:14.872
All right, well, I'm
gonna go grab some stuff

36:14.906 --> 36:18.642
before Jesus claims squatter
rights and keeps it all.

36:18.677 --> 36:19.877
Ok.

36:19.911 --> 36:21.746
Well, see you later, honey.

36:23.882 --> 36:24.849
Mmm.

36:27.786 --> 36:30.054
No, not yet.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.124
Don't let go.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.932
<i>- No, you hang up.
- [Zac] No, you hang up first.</i>

36:41.967 --> 36:43.901
I don't wanna hang up first.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.669
<i>I don't wanna either.</i>

36:45.704 --> 36:48.706
Ok, fine. Goodnight, Zac.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.007
<i>Goodnight.</i>

36:53.779 --> 36:55.746
[ringtone]

36:57.682 --> 37:00.918
Ok, fine, but we can only talk for
five more minutes... I have home...

37:00.952 --> 37:02.686
<i>[Amanda] Shut up.</i>

37:02.721 --> 37:05.022
<i>- Shut up, you little whore!
- Amanda?</i>

37:05.056 --> 37:07.230
<i>Don't you "Amanda" me.</i>

37:07.231 --> 37:08.231
<i>I know what you've been doing with Zachary.</i>

37:08.760 --> 37:11.762
<i>And if you so much as breathe
in his direction again,</i>

37:11.797 --> 37:15.633
<i>I will make you pay, do you understand me?</i>

37:16.134 --> 37:17.868
[disconnects]

37:34.853 --> 37:36.754
[knocking]

37:36.788 --> 37:38.689
- Can I?
- Of course.

37:50.635 --> 37:53.737
- Hi. Thanks.
- Come in.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.673
Well, look at you all grown up.

37:55.707 --> 37:57.675
[door shuts]

37:59.845 --> 38:02.813
So, you know Jude.

38:02.848 --> 38:05.683
Wow, you got so tall.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.952
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:07.986 --> 38:11.689
And I'm Lena. It's very nice to meet you.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.858
Hi, Donald. Thank you.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.694
- I'm Stef. We're glad you could made it.
- Hello.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.797
- Yes, sorry I'm late.
- Just make yourself comfortable.

38:19.831 --> 38:20.965
Thank you.

38:20.999 --> 38:24.735
And if you need anything,
we'll be in the kitchen, ok?

38:24.769 --> 38:25.736
Thanks.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.840
[chuckles] Hi.

38:29.875 --> 38:34.044
Um... whatcha got there?

38:34.079 --> 38:36.714
Uh... you don't remember?

38:36.748 --> 38:40.651
Um... I'm sorry, should I?

38:40.685 --> 38:45.089
Um... 'TJ'. For Thomas Jacob?

38:45.123 --> 38:46.690
Um...

38:47.726 --> 38:48.826
Oh, yeah yeah.

38:48.860 --> 38:54.598
Wow. You kept it all this time, huh?

38:54.633 --> 38:58.903
Do you want it back? I mean,
since it was your dad's?

38:58.937 --> 39:01.639
No. No, this is yours.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.641
I want you... I want you to keep it.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.813
[exhales deeply]

39:09.848 --> 39:12.683
So, um...

39:12.717 --> 39:16.754
Listen, I wanted you guys to know that I...

39:16.788 --> 39:19.857
I signed... um...

39:21.059 --> 39:24.662
I terminated my rights so
you guys can get adopted now.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.098
[folk music]

39:33.772 --> 39:36.674
I just want you guys to know how...

39:36.708 --> 39:37.942
how proud I am to be your dad.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.814
And nothing will ever change that.

39:46.017 --> 39:48.118
I love you guys...

39:48.153 --> 39:49.987
I love you...

39:51.756 --> 39:53.757
more than you'll ever know.

39:53.792 --> 39:54.959
But, um...

39:56.795 --> 39:58.896
the truth is your mother did all
the raising when you were little.

39:58.930 --> 40:03.067
And these ladies, Lena and
Stef, they seem really nice

40:03.101 --> 40:05.869
and this is a...

40:05.904 --> 40:07.905
This is a really...

40:07.939 --> 40:09.940
this is a really good home, this is.

40:11.710 --> 40:14.912
I could never provide you
with anything like this.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.146
So...

40:18.116 --> 40:19.817
I think it's for the best.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.723
Can I give you a hug?

40:29.094 --> 40:30.694
Yeah, ok.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.068
I'm so sorry for everything.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.845
I'll walk you out.

40:49.681 --> 40:50.714
[Donald] Ok.

40:51.916 --> 40:52.883
Bye.

40:56.888 --> 40:58.889
You be good, kiddo, ok?

41:06.865 --> 41:08.065
Thank you...

41:08.099 --> 41:11.035
for saying those things

41:11.069 --> 41:12.136
and signing the papers.

41:14.939 --> 41:16.740
I said I'd do whatever you wanted.

41:19.778 --> 41:22.012
This is what I want.

41:22.047 --> 41:23.847
Good.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.494
When you called me last night, I thought,

41:25.495 --> 41:26.763
"No, I don't care what she says",

41:26.785 --> 41:29.086
"she's wrong, I'm gonna fight for them."

41:31.790 --> 41:33.957
But you asked me to tell Jude the truth.

41:35.894 --> 41:39.963
If I'm being honest with myself,
it's... that's what I just did.

41:39.998 --> 41:42.933
I'll always be your dad.

41:44.202 --> 41:46.136
I'm just not a parent.

41:49.874 --> 41:52.843
If you ever need anything...

41:52.877 --> 41:55.646
um... you know where to find me.

42:00.118 --> 42:03.020
You two take care of each other, ok?

42:03.054 --> 42:05.756
[chuckles]

42:05.790 --> 42:07.825
We always do.
