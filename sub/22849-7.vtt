WEBVTT

00:45.416 --> 00:46.916
I remember.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.416
I remember everything.

02:24.750 --> 02:29.458
CROSSROADS

04:16.500 --> 04:17.666
What are you doing here?

04:18.583 --> 04:20.583
The boy we found in the forest.

04:22.416 --> 04:24.666
What's going to happen to him now?

04:24.750 --> 04:26.416
If you don't figure out who he is

04:26.500 --> 04:29.000
he'll be cremated
and buried in an anonymous grave.

04:29.083 --> 04:30.291
How long has he been dead?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.750
It's all in my report.

04:32.833 --> 04:35.791
When you found him,
ten hours, more or less.

04:36.458 --> 04:38.625
Is it possible that he...

04:40.416 --> 04:41.833
Purely hypothetically,

04:43.375 --> 04:46.666
is it possible he's been dead for longer,
and was somehow preserved?

04:46.750 --> 04:48.166
Preserved?

04:48.250 --> 04:49.541
You mean, like frozen?

04:51.708 --> 04:54.875
If so there would be traces in the tissue.
I would've noticed.

04:54.958 --> 04:56.791
Frozen steak isn't like fresh steak.

04:57.208 --> 05:00.583
-So that's a no.
-Nope. Not that I'm aware of.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.416
How long of a preservation period
are we talking about?

05:08.791 --> 05:11.375
-Thirty-three years.
-Thirty-three years?

05:12.083 --> 05:15.291
The way he looks?
That's pretty much impossible.

05:43.875 --> 05:45.916
MISSING

06:06.083 --> 06:07.083
What day is it today?

06:10.208 --> 06:12.666
-Pardon?
-What day is it today?

06:14.500 --> 06:15.583
November 9th.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.875
I know this sounds crazy...

06:20.041 --> 06:20.958
but what year?

06:22.250 --> 06:23.125
'86.

06:26.125 --> 06:27.041
Thanks.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.458
Wait.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.666
Are you looking for someone?

06:35.000 --> 06:35.833
Yes.

06:37.416 --> 06:38.583
A friend.

06:39.791 --> 06:40.791
Michael Kahnwald.

06:42.375 --> 06:43.375
Never heard of him.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.583
-Ines Kahnwald's son?
-The nurse?

06:48.333 --> 06:50.000
She doesn't have any kids.

06:53.166 --> 06:55.041
Do you know where I can find Ines?

06:56.458 --> 06:57.875
At the hospital maybe.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.625
Well, see you.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.291
Regina, you stupid four-eyes!

07:15.541 --> 07:18.708
We got the power plant shift schedule
for the night Mads disappeared.

07:19.958 --> 07:23.125
I want you to interview them
so we can check their routes and times.

07:23.208 --> 07:26.541
-Maybe we'll find something.
-Can't someone else do that?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.708
I'm working on the case with his brother.

07:29.791 --> 07:32.000
A rape charge.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.250
I mean, we never did consider

07:34.333 --> 07:37.833
whether he may be involved
in his brother's disappearance.

07:37.916 --> 07:38.750
Yes.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.375
Egon.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.500
This isn't the 1950s.

07:42.875 --> 07:45.791
We don't base investigations on hunches,
but on evidence.

07:45.875 --> 07:48.125
You have three months until retirement.

07:48.208 --> 07:51.458
Then you can do whatever you want.
Until then, you do what I want.

08:02.083 --> 08:03.500
33 YEARS?

08:16.333 --> 08:17.708
'86.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.708
'86. '86.

08:23.541 --> 08:26.083
I'm just saying
the ground shook yesterday.

08:26.458 --> 08:29.250
I know this isn't an earthquake zone,
but the ground shook.

08:29.333 --> 08:32.166
-The search warrant for the power plant.
-I have to go.

08:32.250 --> 08:35.041
You have my number
in case you think of anything.

08:39.375 --> 08:41.000
Should I tell Ulrich?

08:43.041 --> 08:45.208
No. Why would anyone talk to me?

09:03.416 --> 09:04.750
Egon.

09:05.708 --> 09:08.375
Helge. You're the one I wanted to see.

09:13.875 --> 09:15.208
Can I help you?

09:16.208 --> 09:18.625
It's about the missing Nielsen boy.

09:18.708 --> 09:22.541
The night he disappeared,
you were on your shift, right?

09:24.375 --> 09:25.208
Yes.

09:25.291 --> 09:29.750
Martin wants to document and corroborate
the routes and times

09:29.833 --> 09:32.208
of everyone who was near here that night.

09:36.291 --> 09:38.791
I have to do my rounds
and check the blocks now.

09:38.875 --> 09:39.791
Okay.

09:40.291 --> 09:42.666
Let's arrange a time
for you to come to the station.

09:46.208 --> 09:48.833
-Day after tomorrow.
-Tuesday.

09:50.708 --> 09:52.541
Is 10:30 okay?

09:53.166 --> 09:54.083
That works.

09:55.916 --> 09:58.166
Sorry for the trouble.

09:59.458 --> 10:00.875
It's no trouble.

10:03.375 --> 10:05.958
I just didn't see anything.
What I mean is...

10:06.541 --> 10:08.291
Everything was totally normal.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.458
Your shift ended at six?

10:12.208 --> 10:14.375
Yes, that's when the night shift starts.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.625
Did you take your car?

10:17.375 --> 10:19.041
I took the state road.

10:19.958 --> 10:24.000
Were you heading somewhere else?
Because you took the state road instead.

10:24.375 --> 10:25.875
Isn't the forest road shorter?

10:25.958 --> 10:27.125
Yeah.

10:28.708 --> 10:30.833
I just picked something up for my father.

10:36.416 --> 10:37.875
See you Tuesday.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.208
Helge?

10:42.708 --> 10:44.333
One more question.

10:45.125 --> 10:48.208
Did you see his brother anywhere that day?

10:48.708 --> 10:51.083
The older Nielsen boy, Ulrich.

10:52.291 --> 10:53.291
Nope.

10:55.875 --> 10:56.875
Till Tuesday.

11:00.083 --> 11:02.666
POLICE DAY PLANNER 1986

11:06.625 --> 11:08.625
INTERVIEW: JANA NIELSEN

11:15.583 --> 11:17.500
INTERVIEW: HELGE DOPPLER
WHY NOT FOREST ROAD?

11:19.958 --> 11:23.625
"10:30, interview with Helge Doppler.
Why not forest road?"

11:36.750 --> 11:38.458
SEARCH WARRANT

12:28.458 --> 12:29.583
Can I help you?

12:31.875 --> 12:34.416
Shouldn't you be in school?

12:36.500 --> 12:37.666
I'm sick.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.583
Well, you look just fine to me.

12:42.791 --> 12:45.458
I hurt my arm. I'm headed to the hospital.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.833
Get in. I'll drive you there.

13:01.416 --> 13:04.958
"Bosch, Teller, Voigt,
Fleischer, Brandt... Doppler, Helge.

13:05.041 --> 13:06.541
27."

13:11.250 --> 13:13.750
CASE: NIELSEN, MADS
STATEMENT: FUCHS, DOREEN

13:13.833 --> 13:15.916
CASE: NIELSEN, MADS
STATEMENT: DOPPLER, HELGE

13:31.416 --> 13:32.250
Yes?

13:32.333 --> 13:34.791
Did you know
that in 1986 your father-in-law

13:34.875 --> 13:36.958
was to be interviewed
in my brother's case?

13:37.041 --> 13:37.875
No.

13:37.958 --> 13:40.291
I went through all the files.

13:40.375 --> 13:43.666
Helge was supposed to be questioned
on Tuesday, November 11, 1986.

13:44.583 --> 13:47.375
Exactly 33 years ago,
from the day after tomorrow.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.833
But there is no statement. He didn't show.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.375
There's just a note.

13:52.208 --> 13:56.541
-"Why not forest road?"
-So you think Helge abducted Mads in 1986?

13:56.625 --> 13:59.000
And now Mikkel and the other boys
33 years later?

13:59.083 --> 14:02.375
-Where is he now?
- In the nursing home. Ulrich!

14:02.458 --> 14:05.083
He's 75 years old. He has dementia.

14:05.666 --> 14:07.541
And the evening Mikkel disappeared,

14:07.625 --> 14:09.208
Helge was with me.

14:09.291 --> 14:12.750
But the evening before Yasin vanished,
WÃ¶ller found Helge in the forest.

14:12.833 --> 14:15.458
And took him back to the nursing home.

14:15.541 --> 14:17.500
Somehow this all has to do with Mads.

14:17.583 --> 14:20.666
-You're barking up the wrong tree.
- Maybe.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.166
But maybe not.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.541
What's your name?

14:54.875 --> 14:56.000
Jonas.

14:58.750 --> 15:01.750
And why didn't you have
your parents drive you?

15:07.041 --> 15:08.666
My mom is at work.

15:09.958 --> 15:11.250
My dad's dead.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.958
Where does your mother work?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.416
At the power plant.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.208
The power plant has changed Winden.

15:24.708 --> 15:26.791
This place used to look different.

15:32.041 --> 15:33.500
What's that there?

15:38.416 --> 15:39.833
Earphones.

15:42.125 --> 15:44.041
Those aren't earphones.

15:47.916 --> 15:50.708
You just put them in your ears.

15:54.125 --> 15:55.875
Now I've seen it all.

16:06.416 --> 16:07.750
It's a shortcut.

17:06.333 --> 17:07.583
Well, here we are.

17:09.875 --> 17:11.125
Wait.

17:11.958 --> 17:14.250
Among you teenagers,

17:14.333 --> 17:15.500
is...

17:16.333 --> 17:18.125
Is Satanism a thing right now?

17:19.333 --> 17:20.458
No idea.

17:24.666 --> 17:26.916
No, I don't know. I don't think so.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.500
Call your mom to pick you up.

17:32.125 --> 17:35.666
It's best not to walk
through the forest alone right now.

17:42.791 --> 17:43.625
Thanks.

19:37.666 --> 19:39.583
I'm looking for Ines Kahnwald.

19:40.583 --> 19:43.583
-She was just outside with the boy.
-What boy?

19:44.875 --> 19:46.083
What do you want Ines for?

19:47.666 --> 19:49.666
I'm visiting and I locked myself out.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.041
Ines didn't mention a visitor.

19:54.041 --> 19:55.416
Are you related?

19:56.625 --> 19:57.791
Yes, you could say that.

20:00.541 --> 20:02.000
Maybe she's still out back.

20:04.083 --> 20:08.375
-Otherwise, I'll tell her when I see her.
-No, I don't want to be any trouble.

21:10.750 --> 21:11.625
Mr. Doppler?

21:12.583 --> 21:13.708
Mr. Doppler?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.875
My name is Ulrich Nielsen.
I'm a police officer.

21:17.958 --> 21:20.416
Don't be scared.
I just want to ask you a few questions.

21:21.208 --> 21:24.833
In 1986, a boy from Winden vanished,
Mads Nielsen.

21:24.916 --> 21:26.375
Do you remember?

21:26.458 --> 21:29.875
You were summoned to the station for
questioning, but there's no transcript.

21:30.958 --> 21:32.916
What does "why not forest road" mean?

21:33.333 --> 21:35.833
-He is...
-What does "why not forest road" mean?

21:35.916 --> 21:37.250
-It's him!
-What does it mean?

21:37.666 --> 21:39.791
-What are you doing here?
-It was him!

21:39.875 --> 21:42.375
-I'm a cop. I want to ask a few questions.
-I know you!

21:42.458 --> 21:44.708
What? What did you say?

21:44.791 --> 21:47.375
-You have to go!
-What? Why were you summoned?

21:47.458 --> 21:50.375
-I can change it. I can change the past.
-I need help!

21:50.791 --> 21:51.958
And the future.

21:52.041 --> 21:53.458
What did you say?

21:53.541 --> 21:56.375
-What did you say? Where is Mikkel?
-Let him go!

21:56.458 --> 21:58.125
Where is my son? Where is Mikkel?

22:01.208 --> 22:04.166
Let me go! Tell me where my son is!

22:04.250 --> 22:06.208
Where is my son? Where is Mikkel?

22:06.958 --> 22:08.083
Let me go!

22:08.166 --> 22:10.541
-Let me go! Don't touch me!
-I can change it.

22:11.583 --> 22:13.541
I can change the past.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.500
And the future.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.083
Tick-tock.

22:18.958 --> 22:20.125
Tick-tock.

22:20.750 --> 22:21.791
Tick-tock.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.625
Tick-tock.

22:27.208 --> 22:29.458
Look! I managed to find another one.

22:40.750 --> 22:43.000
How little we understand of the world.

22:50.708 --> 22:51.625
Is this real?

22:52.708 --> 22:54.541
Or am I crazy, just like my father?

22:55.416 --> 22:59.750
Do you even exist?
Or are you the hallucination of a lunatic?

22:59.833 --> 23:02.541
You're not crazy, neither was your father.

23:02.625 --> 23:05.416
Sometimes it's hard for us
to grasp things that go against

23:05.500 --> 23:07.333
all we are conditioned to believe.

23:07.833 --> 23:11.666
How did people feel the first time
they were told the Earth was round?

23:14.625 --> 23:17.583
-Yes, it is. It's totally insane.
-And if it's not?

23:18.208 --> 23:21.500
How can that be?
Is there a breach in time in the cave?

23:21.958 --> 23:24.333
So Mikkel hangs out here
until he becomes my father?

23:24.416 --> 23:26.583
Even if you don't want to believe it,
that is your father.

23:36.125 --> 23:37.166
That means...

23:39.625 --> 23:41.416
that Ulrich is my grandfather and...

23:42.833 --> 23:44.166
Martha is your aunt.

23:46.666 --> 23:47.833
That's bullshit.

23:49.916 --> 23:52.041
I'm taking him back
and putting this right.

23:52.125 --> 23:53.791
Don't you get it?

23:54.666 --> 23:57.916
If you take Mikkel back, you'll be
meddling in the course of events.

23:59.333 --> 24:03.708
Your father will never meet your mother,
they won't fall in love or get married.

24:03.791 --> 24:04.958
And you won't be born!

24:06.875 --> 24:08.500
If you take him back now,

24:08.583 --> 24:10.916
you'll be erasing your own existence.

24:12.250 --> 24:15.375
The role you play in all of this
is much bigger than you think.

24:19.833 --> 24:24.291
But every decision for something
is a decision against something else.

24:29.083 --> 24:31.625
A life for a life.

24:33.333 --> 24:35.041
What will you decide?

24:58.375 --> 25:01.208
What's the big idea?
First the power plant, now this.

25:02.625 --> 25:06.291
-You know that I have to suspend you.
-Things are going on that make no sense.

25:07.166 --> 25:08.750
Maybe I'm going crazy.

25:10.166 --> 25:11.291
The dead boy.

25:12.666 --> 25:14.583
The boy we found in the forest.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.666
Helge has something to do with it all.

25:20.125 --> 25:22.750
I know you want
to find Mikkel at all costs.

25:23.541 --> 25:26.625
But the end doesn't justify all means.

25:26.708 --> 25:28.833
I should have taken you off this
on day one.

25:28.916 --> 25:31.666
Helge said he can change
the past and the future.

25:31.750 --> 25:34.958
-What's that mean? Why did he say that?
-Helge has dementia.

25:35.541 --> 25:38.125
He can't even tie his own shoes anymore.

25:38.208 --> 25:41.375
He's surely not responsible
for the disappearance of three children.

25:42.250 --> 25:45.166
-He doesn't have the strength.
-Maybe he's not alone.

25:49.333 --> 25:50.333
Go home.

26:00.083 --> 26:01.333
"Why not forest road?"

26:02.500 --> 26:04.166
What does that mean?

26:04.250 --> 26:06.208
Egon Tiedemann wanted to ask him that.

26:07.208 --> 26:08.916
"Why not forest road?"

26:58.166 --> 27:01.125
I don't know who said it,
but Ulrich didn't rape me.

27:01.750 --> 27:05.041
-You don't have to lie for him.
-But I'm not lying.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.458
I wanted it.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.458
We both wanted it. He didn't force me.

27:13.291 --> 27:16.333
And your face? What happened there?

27:19.125 --> 27:20.416
I fell down.

27:20.916 --> 27:22.500
It has nothing to do with it.

27:25.083 --> 27:26.583
Someone saw you.

27:27.916 --> 27:31.291
-Saw how he hurt you.
-That can't be.

27:32.208 --> 27:33.375
Then that person's lying.

27:34.875 --> 27:38.041
-Who said that anyway?
-I'm not allowed to say that.

27:40.875 --> 27:42.583
The only important thing is

27:43.500 --> 27:46.291
that you know
that Ulrich can't harm you right now.

27:47.333 --> 27:50.666
And that he will be punished
for what he did to you.

27:52.250 --> 27:53.666
Ulrich didn't do anything.

27:55.083 --> 27:57.041
If anything, I pressured him into it.

27:57.583 --> 27:59.541
I asked him to get condoms.

28:00.791 --> 28:02.291
But he'd never hurt me.

28:02.958 --> 28:04.625
He would never do that.

28:06.375 --> 28:07.208
Never.

28:27.125 --> 28:28.583
I've been suspended.

28:31.500 --> 28:32.833
Where are the kids?

28:37.125 --> 28:38.291
No idea.

28:43.666 --> 28:45.083
I'm sorry, Katharina.

28:46.958 --> 28:47.916
I'm here now.

28:50.916 --> 28:52.833
You haven't been here for a long time now.

28:58.875 --> 28:59.875
What do you mean?

29:04.416 --> 29:06.833
As long as I've known you,
you've wanted out of Winden.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.500
Were you ever really happy?

29:26.750 --> 29:28.083
What are you talking about?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.625
Of course I was happy.

29:37.958 --> 29:38.958
Weren't you?

29:45.750 --> 29:46.833
I know, Ulrich.

29:52.541 --> 29:53.541
What do you know?

29:58.666 --> 30:00.375
About Hannah and you.

30:11.125 --> 30:12.291
Did she tell you?

30:13.833 --> 30:15.125
Does that matter?

30:22.916 --> 30:23.791
Katharina.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.708
I think I've known it all along.

30:30.500 --> 30:31.958
I just didn't want to see it.

30:42.416 --> 30:43.500
I can explain.

30:45.791 --> 30:47.000
Please don't, Ulrich.

30:59.750 --> 31:00.583
Oh, yeah.

31:01.791 --> 31:03.625
Your mother called a while ago.

31:04.583 --> 31:07.916
Our son has disappeared
and all she talks about is Mads.

31:09.416 --> 31:12.375
And I thought my family
was the one full of assholes.

31:55.208 --> 31:56.041
Hello.

31:56.291 --> 31:57.125
Hello.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.958
If you take him back now,

32:18.041 --> 32:20.666
you'll be erasing your own existence.

32:23.541 --> 32:26.166
But every decision for something

32:26.625 --> 32:28.916
is a decision against something else.

32:57.083 --> 32:59.125
FOR MOTHER'S DAY 1986

32:59.208 --> 33:01.416
Would you want to know,
after all these years?

33:02.500 --> 33:03.666
What?

33:04.625 --> 33:05.750
If he's dead.

33:09.666 --> 33:10.500
No.

33:13.083 --> 33:15.666
I have always held on
to the hope that he's alive.

33:16.666 --> 33:18.666
Your father wanted the grave.

33:19.583 --> 33:22.708
He thought it would help me
find some closure.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.541
But there's no body in it.

33:29.875 --> 33:33.708
For 33 years
I've been imagining that he's alive.

33:35.625 --> 33:36.458
Free.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.833
And happy.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.375
You can never give up hope.

33:58.125 --> 34:01.666
There's as much light out there
as there is darkness.

34:06.583 --> 34:07.541
Don't forget that.

34:12.833 --> 34:15.250
Katharina said
you wanted to tell me something.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.708
One week before Mads...

34:25.416 --> 34:29.208
I didn't tell the police this back then.
I didn't even remember.

34:30.041 --> 34:31.791
I saw something.

34:32.208 --> 34:36.833
In front of the house, across the way,
a priest was arguing with a man.

34:36.916 --> 34:38.333
I don't know what about.

34:38.416 --> 34:41.875
But I found it odd that a priest
would be arguing like that.

34:42.333 --> 34:46.166
And this morning, I saw the same man.

34:47.416 --> 34:48.500
The priest?

34:48.583 --> 34:51.583
No, not the priest. The other man.

34:52.833 --> 34:54.416
It was the same man.

34:55.541 --> 34:56.666
I...

34:56.750 --> 35:00.041
I know that because he had something
on his ear, it was...

35:00.583 --> 35:02.791
It was scarred or disfigured.

35:04.291 --> 35:06.250
But he wasn't a single day older.

35:06.958 --> 35:09.916
He looked exactly like he did
33 years ago.

35:12.041 --> 35:14.000
I know that sounds crazy.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.875
But it was the same man.

35:46.375 --> 35:47.500
Am I interrupting?

35:51.541 --> 35:55.541
You wanted to know if the cave system
goes under the forest road by your cabin.

35:58.291 --> 35:59.916
Not all of it is mapped out.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.833
But at least parts of it extend
under the south part of the forest road.

36:06.958 --> 36:10.625
What's with the cabin?
Is there anything in particular there?

36:12.000 --> 36:13.750
No. Nothing.

36:17.083 --> 36:17.958
Thanks.

36:19.208 --> 36:20.416
Sure thing.

36:57.250 --> 36:58.083
Charlotte?

36:58.666 --> 37:02.416
Did you know that your father was supposed
to be questioned by the police in 1986?

37:02.500 --> 37:03.666
No, I...

37:04.541 --> 37:07.750
-Why do you ask?
-The cabin on the forest road.

37:09.291 --> 37:10.916
Why did Helge keep it

37:11.000 --> 37:12.791
after all that happened to him there?

37:12.875 --> 37:14.500
Did he even use it?

37:14.583 --> 37:15.916
Did he rent it out?

37:16.458 --> 37:17.666
Why are you asking?

37:17.750 --> 37:19.541
When was the first time you were there?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.500
Was it already in 1986?

37:21.583 --> 37:23.875
I don't know why you want to know that.

37:23.958 --> 37:26.458
Did your father live in the cabin in '86?

37:27.833 --> 37:28.666
I don't know.

37:28.750 --> 37:29.583
Maybe.

37:29.958 --> 37:33.541
I came to Winden in 1987.
I didn't know about the cabin then.

37:34.125 --> 37:37.208
- That was after Helge's accident.
-When was that?

37:38.125 --> 37:40.333
- Where are you now?
-When was the accident?

37:41.875 --> 37:43.958
November 12th, 1986.

37:44.041 --> 37:45.708
So three days from today.

37:46.375 --> 37:47.250
Come home.

37:47.875 --> 37:50.458
The kids have barely seen you in days.

37:51.250 --> 37:52.208
They're worried.

37:53.291 --> 37:54.291
And so am I.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.916
-I have to go.
- Charlotte...

38:33.625 --> 38:37.708
Dad, the question isn't how,
the question is when.

41:37.250 --> 41:39.125
Boy, you startled me.

41:40.833 --> 41:42.041
Where were you?

41:52.916 --> 41:53.750
What's wrong?

41:56.291 --> 41:57.416
Do you believe in fate?

42:07.875 --> 42:09.916
I... I don't know.

42:14.666 --> 42:16.875
Maybe it's my fate that men leave me.

42:19.125 --> 42:21.083
I think Dad loved you very much.

42:43.166 --> 42:45.833
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4,
10:13 P.M.

43:44.208 --> 43:47.541
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

44:36.333 --> 44:38.333
This is Charlotte Doppler. I'll call back.

44:39.041 --> 44:40.458
Charlotte,

44:40.541 --> 44:43.416
the question isn't
who abducted the children, but when.

44:43.500 --> 44:47.875
I was right, Helge Doppler.
Not now, but in 1986.

44:48.458 --> 44:50.750
Call me back immediately
when you get this.

48:15.458 --> 48:19.750
NOVEMBER 5, 1953
NOVEMBER 9, 1953

51:07.916 --> 51:11.916
