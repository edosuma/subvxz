That’s ridiculous. No one
can guarantee how they’re gonna
feel about someone for life.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.904
- We’re not a monogamous species.
- Marriage has been around
since the beginning of time.

express their love by spitting
in their partners’ faces.

past that.

Okay, well, you know what?
Sometimes love trumps logic.

04:13.087 --> 04:15.874
Love is a chemical process
which causes delusion.

would never get married.

Why would Meriel plan a wedding

was to be a bride.

We had a wedding cake tasting.

I don’t want to come off
as sounding offensive,

06:05.491 --> 06:08.528

maybe she got cold feet?

take part in a meaningless ritual...

- then shouldn’t you warn Sweets
that he’s being cuckolded?
- [ Beeping]

Now listen, Bones.
There are complicated emotions
that are involved here.

10:35.594 --> 10:38.631
- This is definitely not your thing.
- It’s a matter of honesty.

It’s none ofour business.

- The dead bride?

completely your business,

- Mm-hmm.
- No, we werejust—
- Am I missing something?

No. Crazy. Daisy.
You must really miss Daisy.

10:59.535 --> 11:01.196
Yeah. We manage.
1 et me ask you a question.

11:01.286 --> 11:06.246
Could dealing with crazy brides all day
make someone snap and commit murder?

11:06.333 --> 11:10.076
No, the bride snapped ﬁrst.
She had a ﬁght with
the bridal consultant

11:10.170 --> 11:14.004
Right. /f the bride ’5 physical
or emotional needs are not met,
yeah, she might act out.

11:14.091 --> 11:17.333
Violence is rare though.
Infidelity’s more common.

Using some disposable sap
as an emotional Band-Aid.

- Right.
- Fascinating.
- Yep. Let’s go!

is definitely a possibility. Right?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.943
I don’t—

11:44.162 --> 11:46.289
I worked at Bertolino’s
for 29 years.

11:46.373 --> 11:51.288
No matter what a bride looked
like coming in, when I was done
with her, she was beautiful.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.916
But that one— Miss Mitsakos.
Ugly from the inside out.

11:55.007 --> 11:57.669
Okay. Why don ’t you just
tell us about Meriel?

11:57.759 --> 12:02.093
Every time she dropped a pound,
she made me adjust that bodice,
which would’ve been fine.

12:02.180 --> 12:07.345
But Friday she decided,
instead ofa drop waist,
she wanted a natural waist.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.347
She suggested I start from scratch.

12:09.438 --> 12:12.396
She insinuated I didn’t know
what I was doing,

12:12.482 --> 12:16.066
that her dress issues
were my fault.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.690
She pushed me away.
Pushed me!

12:18.822 --> 12:21.529
Then— Then you slapped her?
No.

12:21.617 --> 12:24.609
I slapped her after she
threw the pins at me.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.989
You got fired.
You must’ve been angry.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.116
I pride myself
on being a gentlewoman.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.789
I would rather not talk
about this any further.
lunderstand

12:34.880 --> 12:37.121
Just, uh, one more thing.

12:37.215 --> 12:41.208
You had Merle/’5 personal information,
her account, address, et cetera.

12:41.303 --> 12:44.215
Can you account for your whereabouts
the day after you got fired?

12:44.306 --> 12:46.922
I know what you’re implying,
Agent Booth.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.554
I was at home. I live alone.

12:49.645 --> 12:54.105
But I have spent the last 29 years
bringing joy to young women.

12:54.191 --> 12:56.682
So no alibi.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.852
I am a gentlewoman.

[Device Beeps]
Hodgins found gravel
in her hair,

13:07.120 --> 13:09.076
but death by gravel
is unlikely.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.117
Time to get her
offthe cardboard?
How?

13:11.208 --> 13:13.699
She ’s basically been absorbed
into the substrate.

13:13.794 --> 13:16.581
We could cut underneath,
but that runs the risk
of compromising the bones.

13:16.672 --> 13:19.414
- We have to scrape her off.
- [Hodgins]
look at this.

13:19.508 --> 13:23.092

on the pureed maggots.

13:23.178 --> 13:26.011
Tequila. The maggots
were hammered.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.381
Which means Meriel was too.
Yeah. But it gets better.

13:29.476 --> 13:33.389
The weird glaze on the vic’s
clothing wasn’t extruded fat.
It was glycerin.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.348
According to Dr. Brennan,
Bertolino’s uses glycerin
to preserve bridal bouquets.

13:37.442 --> 13:41.185
Looks like Bridezilla
might’ve messed with
the wrong old lady.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.998
I used to work
at Anthony’s Famous
in Georgetown.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.118
Oh, that is some
seriously good pizza.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.370
The secret is the crust.
It’s all in the crust.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.793
Does this relate to our victim at all?

13:58.880 --> 14:01.838
This is basically ho w we get
the pizzas out of the oven.
E very pie was perfect.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.586
Everybody ready?

14:03.677 --> 14:06.589

out of myjob description,
it’s not even funny.

Okay We are in.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.888
Oh, she ’s sticking.

14:10.976 --> 14:13.592
It was always tough
getting the pie out.

14:13.687 --> 14:17.396
The cheese would bubble over
onto the oven and stick.
Pie could break apart.

Careful of the skull.

14:29.745 --> 14:32.987

Now that’s something
I’d serve!

14:35.333 --> 14:38.291

which she’s not.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.869

consultant killed Meriel?

14:55.604 --> 14:57.640
Not really, but, you know,
hey, I’ve been wrong before.

14:57.773 --> 15:00.936

No, that would be you,

You’ve never married.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.562
Well, I will.
That’s impossible to know.

15:06.656 --> 15:10.069
You have issues with this,
so next time we see Sweets,
you should bring it up.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.242
Sweets is having an affair
with a woman who’s engaged.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.320
He’s hardly one to give advice.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.496

That’s what it is.

-I have no idea what that means.
-“What would Brennan do?”

15:47.531 --> 15:49.817
I mean, it really
should be “W.W.D.B.D.?”

15:49.908 --> 15:51.648
“What would
Dr. Brennan do?”

15:51.743 --> 15:55.110
But that seems unnecessarily formal
since I’m only thinking it silently.

15:55.247 --> 15:57.579

Yeah, she’s adorable.

any emotional pain...

and she’s cheating on him,

17:16.494 --> 17:17.950
somewhere inside he knows.

17:18.038 --> 17:21.075

because he doesn’t want to.

a Meriel Mitsakos, was murdered.

22:47.617 --> 22:49.858
[Sighs]

22:49.953 --> 22:52.160
Do you know the victim?

22:52.247 --> 22:57.367
No, but I’m in the process
of securing venture capital
to take my company national.

22:57.460 --> 23:00.076
Ifthis gets out,
I could lose my investors.

23:00.171 --> 23:02.287
Right. We’re gonna have to
take a look at Meriel’s—

23:02.382 --> 23:04.338
Was it Date or Hate activity?

23:04.425 --> 23:07.337
- Well, that’s private.
- Well, she’s dead, Mr. Rossi.

23:07.428 --> 23:10.966
Or maybe your in vestors
would like the publicity
of a court order.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.303
[Sighs]

23:15.520 --> 23:17.431
[ Typing]

23:17.522 --> 23:20.434
/n the last month, she was
matched with 20 potentials.

23:20.525 --> 23:24.313
She hit “Hate” on 7 4 of them,
“Date ” on five.

23:24.404 --> 23:29.068
She never responded to
the last guy— a Jack Hodgins—
from earlier today.

23:29.158 --> 23:32.321
When did she
last press “Date”?

23:32.412 --> 23:34.528
7:45 pm. last Friday.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.830
- That was the night she was murdered.
- Do you have a name?

23:40.044 --> 23:43.002
Owen Smith.
He pressed “Date ” too.

23:48.595 --> 23:51.132
I don’t believe it.
There’s no way Meriel
was cheating on me.

23:51.222 --> 23:54.089
- You’re sure?
- We were engaged, Agent Booth.

23:54.183 --> 23:57.095
Would you want someone
to tell you ifyour girlfriend
was cheating?

23:57.186 --> 23:59.723
Or do you favor denial?

23:59.814 --> 24:03.932
No. I mean, I’d know
if Daisy were cheating on me,
Dr. Brennan.

24:04.027 --> 24:07.064
I’m trained to recognize
the subtleties
ofhuman behavior,

24:07.155 --> 24:09.271
so moot point.

24:09.365 --> 24:11.276
[Booth]
/ think you found out
she was cheating.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.232
I mean, she wasn’t
really discreet.

24:13.328 --> 24:17.617
Using her cell phone
to, uh, meet other guys.

24:17.707 --> 24:21.450
/t’s understandable
that you snapped

24:21.544 --> 24:23.751
Are you sure about this list?

24:23.838 --> 24:25.624
Yeah.

24:25.715 --> 24:27.956
That’s what makes it
so understandable.

24:28.051 --> 24:31.669
- Where were you the night
that she disappeared?
- Dance class.

24:31.763 --> 24:35.676
Genie told me how important
that first dance was to Meriel,

24:35.767 --> 24:37.382
and / just wanted
to be perfect for her.

24:37.477 --> 24:42.471
In our sessions, you put
a high premium on honesty,
don’t you, Dr. Sweets?

24:42.565 --> 24:45.807
Of course.
Do you think he’s lying?

24:45.902 --> 24:47.813
Uh, no.

24:47.904 --> 24:49.895
I’m talking about you and Daisy.

24:51.366 --> 24:53.482
She’s engaged to be married,

24:53.576 --> 24:57.239
and she’s sleeping with you
behind her fiancé’s back.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.867
What? No.

24:59.957 --> 25:03.324
You’re wrong, Dr. Brennan.
That can’t be. You’re wrong.

25:03.419 --> 25:07.287
Obviously you can’t read
all the psychological subtleties
that you think you can.

25:08.966 --> 25:12.879
Booth and I saw her trying
on her wedding dress
with her fiancé.

25:12.970 --> 25:17.088
He hugged her
and twirled her around
in the air.

25:17.183 --> 25:20.641
[Exhales]
That’s impossible, Dr. Brennan.

25:20.770 --> 25:23.637
I would’ve known.
This is denial, right?

25:23.731 --> 25:25.722
No. I mean—

25:28.194 --> 25:29.900
Oh, God.

25:29.987 --> 25:32.854
Booth felt that I shouldn’t tell you,
that it was none ofour business.

25:32.949 --> 25:35.861
But I think that now you can
make an informed decision.

25:35.952 --> 25:39.865
Either share Miss Wick,
or move on.

25:39.956 --> 25:42.948
[Gasping]

25:43.042 --> 25:44.953
Um—

25:46.379 --> 25:48.540
I’m sorry. Uh—

25:48.631 --> 25:50.622
C-Could you excuse me
for a moment?

25:50.717 --> 25:53.083
I need—I need
a minute to myself.

25:53.177 --> 25:56.544
Sure. Booth is finished
anyway, so—

26:04.272 --> 26:08.606
/ found fractures on the piece
of the cranium inconsistent with
the compression from the baler.

26:08.693 --> 26:11.935
Stop. That’s a good one.
Dr. Brennan thought
we might be able...

26:12.029 --> 26:14.816
to ﬁnd the cause of the fracture
by reexamining photos of the tissue.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.863
Isolate her head full frame.

26:18.578 --> 26:21.035
I don’t see anything, guys.

26:21.122 --> 26:23.989
We’re not looking on the surface.
We’re looking beneath it.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.119
Okay. Well, I need to
enhance the details.

26:26.210 --> 26:29.373
/ can shower the image with
various wavelengths of light.

26:29.464 --> 26:31.420
Next / apply the ﬁlter soﬁ‘ware.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.714
Finally, I blacken the blacks,

26:33.801 --> 26:36.713
maximize contrast
and sharpen the focus.

26:36.804 --> 26:40.217
- Perimortem bruising.
- That’s a tire tread.

26:43.311 --> 26:44.767
She was run over by a car.

26:44.854 --> 26:47.971
Seems like our victim was flattened
before she was flattened.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.444
Hi.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.787
So, herfiancé’s alibi
checks out.

27:01.871 --> 27:04.112
He was dancing
the night away.

27:04.207 --> 27:07.370
I told Sweets about Daisy.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.041
Bones, why?

27:09.128 --> 27:12.791
I felt like I was lying to him
by keeping it to myself.

27:12.924 --> 27:16.007
Well, howabout the others?
Huh? The others?
He was dating other people?

27:16.093 --> 27:18.425
No. The othersuspects
in Meriel’s murder.

27:18.554 --> 27:21.091
What about Owen Smith?
The Bureau is doing
a background check

27:21.182 --> 27:23.548
Smith, he was using
a disposable phone...

27:23.643 --> 27:25.679
and his e-mail accounts
were canceled.

27:28.940 --> 27:31.773
to get a little somethin’-somethin’
on the side.

27:31.859 --> 27:35.192
Why’d you have to tell Sweets?
He ’5 gonna come in here.
He ’5 gonna cry and stuff

27:36.864 --> 27:38.775
Excuse me.

27:38.866 --> 27:41.482
Oh, God.

27:41.577 --> 27:44.990
- Um, you have a minute?
- Of course.

27:45.081 --> 27:47.697
I was talking to Agent Booth.
I’d like a minute alone.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.373
Sure.

27:56.259 --> 27:59.877
Well, I’ll get right to it. Uh—

27:59.971 --> 28:04.340
Dr. Brennan told me that Daisy
is engaged to another man.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.924
I’m sorry, Sweets. I—

28:07.019 --> 28:09.510
It’s okay It’s okay

28:09.605 --> 28:11.596
Dr. Brennan was being honest.
I appreciate it.

28:11.691 --> 28:14.899
No, you don’t. Come on.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.939
I don’t! I don’t!
I feel like an idiot!
Yeah, yeah. Have a seat.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.988
Come on.
Daisy—

28:21.075 --> 28:23.566
She’s been canceling on me
all the time late/y,

28:23.661 --> 28:25.617
like yoga the other day.

28:25.705 --> 28:28.822
And, you know, recently,

28:28.916 --> 28:31.373
at night when she’s over,

28:31.460 --> 28:33.416
the frequency of our—

28:34.964 --> 28:36.920
our intimate relations—

28:37.008 --> 28:39.624
She says that she’s been tired
because of her dissertation.

28:39.719 --> 28:42.335
- I get it.
- It was right in front of me.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.421
Right in front of me all along.

28:45.641 --> 28:48.223
[Exhales]
I’m a failure...

28:48.311 --> 28:50.552
as a lover and a psychologist.

28:50.646 --> 28:54.434
No, no, it’s not true.
Sweets, these things, they happen.

28:54.525 --> 28:56.607
Okay. What should I do?

28:56.694 --> 29:00.812
/ don ’t have many
manly-man friends like you
that / can talk to.

29:00.907 --> 29:03.239
What would a guy guy do
in this situation?

29:03.326 --> 29:05.817
Are you asking me
ifyou should fight for her?

29:07.622 --> 29:10.364
You think I should?

29:10.458 --> 29:14.997
Ifyou were your own patient,
what kind ofadvice would you
give yourself?

29:16.380 --> 29:19.497
Impressive.
Turn the question back on me.

29:19.592 --> 29:22.254
It’s a classic
therapeutic technique,

29:22.345 --> 29:24.427
and it’s really, really annoying.

29:24.513 --> 29:27.846
- Did it work?
- Yeah. I should confront her.

29:27.934 --> 29:30.596
I should be candid.
You’re right.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.472
You’re right. It’s the only way.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.428
- Thank you.
- Any time.

29:34.565 --> 29:36.647
That was very helpful.
Session’s over.

29:36.734 --> 29:38.725
[Chuckles]
Um—

29:38.819 --> 29:42.482
Hey, you think
maybe we could hug?

29:42.615 --> 29:45.948
Like men, of course.
It’d be comforting for me—
No.

29:46.077 --> 29:48.284
under the— No?
No. I don’t hug things out.

29:48.371 --> 29:50.987
You know, wejust kind of—
good slug in the arm.

29:51.082 --> 29:52.822
It’s more ofa manly thing to do.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.453
Okay.
Okay.

29:54.585 --> 29:56.667
Sure.
Okay?

29:56.796 --> 29:59.003
Could you do it again?
Sure.

29:59.090 --> 30:00.796
- Ha-ha! Want more?
- No.

30:00.883 --> 30:03.090
- Okay. See ya.
- Thank you.

30:03.177 --> 30:05.293
[Mouths Word]

30:05.388 --> 30:08.721
Wendell’s data suggests
that she was struck
by an SUV.

30:08.808 --> 30:13.518
The patella fractures
are several centimeters higher
than a standard car bumper.

30:13.604 --> 30:16.846
You didn’t find any incise
wounds with glass or paint,
did you?

30:16.983 --> 30:18.644
No. Why?
Hmm.

30:18.734 --> 30:20.850
I’mjust confirming
that the victim didn’t
wrap around the hood.

30:20.945 --> 30:24.437
Which means that
her center ofgravity
thrust her backwards.

30:24.532 --> 30:26.523
Something like this.

30:27.952 --> 30:31.444
Hey, uh, whatever happened
to your online dating thing?

30:31.539 --> 30:35.578
I didn’t have the time
to properly sort through
all the potential matches.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.909
You thinking oftrying it?

30:38.004 --> 30:40.245
I think Sweets should sign up.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.421
Did you really tell Sweets
that Daisy was cheating on him?

30:42.508 --> 30:45.671
Everyone seems to think that
I’ve done something terrible.
I didn’t want to lie.

30:45.761 --> 30:48.719
- In this case,
it was definitely the way to go.
- Okay lad/es.

30:48.806 --> 30:50.762
It’s ready.

30:54.729 --> 30:56.265
[Gasps]
Ooh.

30:57.940 --> 31:02.354
In newer-model S.U.V.’s,
the grill protrudes almost
as far as the bumper.

31:02.445 --> 31:04.527
It’s like being hit
by a battering ram.

31:04.613 --> 31:07.025
I thought you said you found
tire treads on her head.

31:07.116 --> 31:09.072
No, I’m not finished.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.651
Assuming this
was done on purpose,

31:11.746 --> 31:15.330
the driver backed up to see
where his victim had landed,

31:15.416 --> 31:17.407
and then he gunned it.

31:20.671 --> 31:22.662
The multidirectional
fractures on the skull...

31:22.757 --> 31:25.499
are consistent with a tire’s
downward vertical force.

31:25.593 --> 31:29.632
The killer ran her do wn
and then made sure she was dead
by running her 0 ver again.

31:29.722 --> 31:32.509
That is much worse than anything
I might’ve done to Sweets.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.182
I’ll call Booth.

31:40.024 --> 31:42.060
- Excuse me, Dr. Hodgins.
- Yeah?

31:42.151 --> 31:45.393
I wanted to tell you that I’m
going to the Founding Fathers
for a drink tonight...

31:45.488 --> 31:47.353
with some friends.

31:47.490 --> 31:50.106
Girlfriends.
Girlfriends?

31:50.201 --> 31:53.739
I’ve got a bunch
of friends who are girls,
and we hang out like we’re guys.

31:53.829 --> 31:57.287
It’s not as confusing as it sounds.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.793
Most ofthem are single.
Oh.

31:59.877 --> 32:01.788
Trying to fix me up there,
VVendeH?

32:01.879 --> 32:04.336
I’m offering you an opportunity
to meet some great people.

32:04.465 --> 32:07.127
Who have breasts.
That they do.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.547
I think they’d like you.
You don’t really know me.

32:10.638 --> 32:13.345
I grew up on the streets,
Dr. Hodgins.

32:13.432 --> 32:16.799
It doesn’t take me long
to get a feel for someone.

32:16.894 --> 32:18.509
First round’s on me.

32:20.648 --> 32:23.515
Booth got the name
ofthe victim’s drinking partner...

32:23.609 --> 32:26.225
from the bartender
at the Champagne Lounge.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.107
Joe Fillion.
He works in this building.

32:29.198 --> 32:33.942
Oh, there’s another S.U.V.
D.C. plates F793A4.

32:34.036 --> 32:36.493
Those plates are registered
toJoe Fillion.

32:36.580 --> 32:39.743
So this guy ran her down,
then backed up
and ran over her again?

32:39.875 --> 32:42.491
That’s a bad date.
[Chuckles]

32:44.922 --> 32:47.083
Well, these stains
could be blood.

32:47.174 --> 32:49.460
What was the height
ofthe patella fractures?

32:49.552 --> 32:51.884
Uh, 54 centimeters.

32:51.971 --> 32:54.963
- Undo my necklace.
- Oh.

32:55.057 --> 32:57.264
I need to measure
ifthe point ofimpact
matches.

32:57.351 --> 32:59.683
What happened
to your measuring tape?

32:59.770 --> 33:01.351
I don’t know. It’s missing.

33:01.438 --> 33:05.022
There was a Post-it note
from the Egyptology department
in its place.

33:05.109 --> 33:08.067
Exactly one and a half
lengths high.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.941
Consistent with
the patella point
of impact.

33:11.031 --> 33:14.114
The victim is skull
was crushed by a tire.

33:14.201 --> 33:16.578
It was the proximate
cause of death, yes.

33:20.624 --> 33:23.866
- The victim had black hair, right?
- Yes.

33:28.090 --> 33:29.921
I think we found
the murder weapon.

33:33.304 --> 33:37.263
So were you
at the Champagne Lounge
to meet women in general...

33:37.349 --> 33:38.930
or Meriel in particular?

33:39.018 --> 33:42.181
No. I was meeting Meriel.
Look, there’s no secret.
Her friend Genie knew.

33:42.271 --> 33:45.013
I wanted to get
my engagement ring back.

33:46.609 --> 33:50.067
You were engaged?
Yeah. She broke it off
when she met that Mike guy.

33:50.154 --> 33:52.486
- The ring was my grandmother’s.
- Did she give the ring back?

33:52.573 --> 33:56.031
No. She sold it to pay
for her wedding.

33:56.118 --> 33:58.074
[Scoffs]

33:59.079 --> 34:01.035
She sold
your grandmother’s ring?

34:01.123 --> 34:03.580
Are you kidding me?
That’s only the halfof it.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.658
When we were talking,
her cell phone rang.

34:05.753 --> 34:07.835
It was one ofthose
Date or Hate match thingies.

34:07.922 --> 34:10.288
And Meriel presses “Date.”

34:10.424 --> 34:12.005
Oh!
I mean, can you believe that?

34:12.134 --> 34:15.217
She’s screwing over
her new fiancé too.
Wow.

34:15.304 --> 34:18.467
- That must’ve made you mad,Joe.
- Oh, yeah!

34:20.643 --> 34:24.886
Oh, c— Oh, come on.
Look, you’re not gonna
blame me for this.

34:25.022 --> 34:28.685
All right, no. look
She is not gonna screw me again!
[Phone Ringing]

34:28.776 --> 34:30.812
Whoa. Look at that.
That is the lab calling.

34:30.903 --> 34:34.441
They tore apart your S.U.V.
Anything you want to tell me
before I pick this up?

34:35.658 --> 34:37.990
Yeah.

34:39.036 --> 34:41.448
I want a lawyer.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.497
Well, you know, he didn’t do it,
at least not with that vehicle.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.579
What about the hair
and the blood?

34:51.674 --> 34:53.585
Uh, he hit a dog
last week.

34:53.676 --> 34:56.463
And when he talked about it,
he burst out into tears, you know?

34:56.553 --> 34:59.260
He was more upset about that
than he was about Meriel.

34:59.348 --> 35:02.010
Well, she lied to him,
and he hates her for it.

35:02.101 --> 35:05.093
Cam thinks that I should’ve
deceived Sweets too.

35:05.187 --> 35:08.145
You know, I don’t understand.
Our lives are devoted
to the pursuit oftruth.

35:08.232 --> 35:11.599
You can’t go around telling
everybody what’s on your mind
even though it’s the truth.

35:11.694 --> 35:13.605
What ifyou and I
were going out, right?

35:13.696 --> 35:16.483
And you were, you know,
taking forever to get ready,

35:16.573 --> 35:20.065
and you came out in this dress,
and I told you I didn’t like it.

35:20.202 --> 35:23.114
What are you gonna do?
I’d reevaluate, change
or ignore you.

35:23.205 --> 35:26.038
Of course you would, Bones.
Good answer.

35:29.086 --> 35:32.078
These are the guys
that Meriel met
on that Date or Hate.

35:32.172 --> 35:34.504
We’re looking
for Owen Smith.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.627
Here he is.
Owen Smith.

35:36.719 --> 35:39.301
- Hmm. He looks weird.
- Why? The guy looks perfect.

35:39.388 --> 35:42.425
I know. That’s what’s weird.
He doesn’t look real, right?

35:42.516 --> 35:45.758
He seems too young for
plastic surgery, but these
wide, flaring cheekbones—

35:45.853 --> 35:49.437
There’s no way that they could
coexist with this nasal bridge.

35:49.523 --> 35:51.764
He is real.
Owen Smith, her final date.

35:51.859 --> 35:54.771
Connected at 7:45
the night she disappeared.

35:54.862 --> 35:56.853
I don’t know.

[Door Opens]

36:03.329 --> 36:06.036
What’s so important,
Lancelot?

36:06.165 --> 36:08.656
You miss me too much?
Please sit down, Daisy.

36:08.751 --> 36:11.584
What’s wrong?

36:13.464 --> 36:15.955
I’ve— I’ve devoted myself
to this relationship.

36:16.050 --> 36:18.666
l’ve given you everything—
my heart—

36:18.761 --> 36:21.343
- Are you breaking up with me?
- I love you.

36:21.472 --> 36:23.804
But I can no longer—
You are breaking up with me!

36:23.891 --> 36:27.429
- Tears will have no impact on me, Daisy!
- Why? What have I done?

36:27.519 --> 36:30.932
You’re engaged to someone else,
for God’s sakes.

36:31.023 --> 36:35.141
I’m not gonna be your boy toy
because you have a dysfunctional
relationship with your fiancé!

36:35.235 --> 36:37.487
- What?
- All those classes that you go to. I—

36:37.571 --> 36:39.482
You probably don’t even
take yoga, do you?

36:39.573 --> 36:42.485
IfI wasn’t taking yoga,
how could I do a shirshasena?

36:42.576 --> 36:44.487
What about the wedding dress?

36:44.578 --> 36:48.412
Booth and Brennan saw you
trying it on at the bridal shop,

36:48.499 --> 36:50.706
cavorting with your fiancé!

36:50.793 --> 36:52.704
Baby, my cousin
is out of town.

36:52.795 --> 36:56.379
Bertolino’s was having
their annual sale.
We’re the same size.

36:56.465 --> 36:58.581
It was 50% off. One day only.

36:58.675 --> 37:00.506
Okay. And that man
you were with?

37:00.594 --> 37:03.802
Her fiancé, not mine.

37:05.224 --> 37:07.385
I love my Lancelot.

37:10.229 --> 37:12.140
Oh, my God.

37:12.231 --> 37:15.974
I was sojealous.
How could I have doubted you?

37:16.068 --> 37:18.229
Well, we’re both
beautiful people, Lance.

37:18.320 --> 37:21.312
I mean, we’re bound to
getjealous sometimes.

37:24.701 --> 37:27.613
I wish we could run home
together right now.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.497
I can’t wait that long.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.503
I can’t believe
I didn’t see that before.
See what?

37:46.598 --> 37:48.554
What are we looking for?
Okay.

37:48.642 --> 37:51.509
Owen is a composite
ofthese four other dates.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.891

Mel jensen ’5 eyes,

37:54.982 --> 37:58.850
Frank Hen/ey’s mouth
and Mickey jasper’s nose
and cheekbones.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.902
Someone created the perfect man
in order to meet our victim.

38:01.989 --> 38:04.651
Someone who had access
to all these photos.

38:10.914 --> 38:15.408
That’s insane. Why would
I create a fake persona
just to meet some girl?

38:15.502 --> 38:18.494
Because your facial
morphology’s subpar.

38:18.589 --> 38:21.797
Your supraorbital torus
is too high and thick.

38:21.884 --> 38:24.091
You lack
a mental eminence.

38:24.178 --> 38:27.386
- Bones, he gets the picture.
- This is crazy.

38:27.473 --> 38:31.057
We checked with the D.M.V.
We know that you drive
a sport utility vehicle.

38:31.143 --> 38:35.102
See, the forensics team
is examining your S.U.V. right now.

38:40.402 --> 38:42.393
It was an accident.

38:44.573 --> 38:47.110
Hitting her once
might have been an accident,

38:47.201 --> 38:52.070
but running over her twice
seems very deliberate.

38:52.164 --> 38:54.701
She said she wanted a funny,
smart, successful guy.

38:54.791 --> 38:56.372
That’s me.

38:58.837 --> 39:02.000
Ijust wanted a chance.
Rea/Av?

39:02.090 --> 39:05.423
And you thought she’d overlook
the fake photo that you
put in there too, huh?

39:06.887 --> 39:09.879
All these beautiful women
on my service, but...

39:11.600 --> 39:13.591
none ofthem will look at me.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.232
I’m better than half
the losers that sign up.

39:19.316 --> 39:22.683
- She laughed you off,
and you followed her?
- No.

39:22.778 --> 39:25.360
I was driving down the alley
on my way home.

39:25.447 --> 39:28.234
She was having a smoke.
I rolled down my window
to talk—just talk.

39:28.325 --> 39:30.316
And she gave me the finger
and walked away.

39:30.410 --> 39:33.117
- And you ran her down.
- Twice.

39:37.084 --> 39:39.075
I don’t know what happened.

39:41.255 --> 39:44.122
I’m a nice guy. I’m smart.
