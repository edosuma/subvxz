00:19.228 --> 00:20.438
You owe me for that
window in my house.

00:22.606 --> 00:23.607
I didn't do anything.

00:24.275 --> 00:26.527
You didn't? Who broke in and tried
to steal my plants?

00:26.569 --> 00:29.238
It was Teo. And I told him that
wasn't the right way.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.615
Why should I believe you?

00:33.534 --> 00:34.577
What can I say?

00:43.669 --> 00:45.004
I want to propose something.

00:46.130 --> 00:46.964
Really?

00:52.094 --> 00:53.804
Sell me some of your cannabis.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.809
Man, you're really crazy,
aren't you?

01:00.853 --> 01:02.521
I am well aware of that.

01:03.481 --> 01:05.983
Everything we grow is weighed.

01:06.025 --> 01:07.943
The government
checks every gram.

01:09.528 --> 01:10.821
It doesn't have to be that much.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.991
I can get good money
for that shit.

01:14.033 --> 01:16.827
You think I'm gonna risk my
enterprise for something so stupid?

01:24.210 --> 01:25.044
Think about it.

01:26.629 --> 01:29.173
You could help your mom
with the extra money.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.342
Eat shit.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.965
don't understand why your name isn't
in the article.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.175
You were the one

02:55.217 --> 02:58.637
who talked the nurses into speaking
about the gynecologists' cartel.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.307
According to Valeria,
it was the publisher's decision.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.935
Well, doing something like that
to a girlfriend is unacceptable.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.312
Ex-girlfriend, Gabrielito.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.396
Ex-girlfriend.

03:07.438 --> 03:09.023
Either way, what a bitch, right?

03:10.524 --> 03:11.525
Let her take the credit.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.695
No one will remember the article
tomorrow and in a couple of weeks,

03:14.737 --> 03:17.197
everyone will be talking about Villa
and the smugglers.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.366
That will be the only news.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.035
Start paying attention.
What have you got?

03:21.994 --> 03:23.120
I didn't get anything, Lola.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.457
Don't you dare bring me
any lame excuses.

03:26.498 --> 03:29.209
I knocked on every door.
Nobody wants to talk!

03:30.586 --> 03:31.754
Are you fucking around?

03:31.795 --> 03:34.089
Really, that guy
must have paid everyone off.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.133
No one's gonna talk.

03:36.175 --> 03:37.718
Villa is lying, Gabriel.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.638
Little lies always hide
some big shit.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.056
Don't you think?

03:43.432 --> 03:45.809
You're gonna end up
losing on this one.

04:18.217 --> 04:20.928
CARTAGENA OFFICERS
INVOLVED IN SMUGGLING RING

04:20.970 --> 04:23.138
AFFILIATION,
CHANGE OF PATH

04:23.180 --> 04:25.766
VILLA-LOPEZ CONNECTION

04:25.808 --> 04:30.104
LARGEST CARIBBEAN SMUGGLING RING
TAKEN DOWN IN VILLA CASE

04:30.145 --> 04:34.149
UNEXPECTED TWIST IN VILLA CASE

04:34.191 --> 04:37.152
POLITICIANS FROM THE COASTAL AREA
MAY BE INVOLVED

04:45.869 --> 04:47.997
SMUGGLERS' CLOSED CASES

05:14.523 --> 05:15.607
Shit!

05:28.287 --> 05:30.539
The article Lola did on you
is coming out in half an hour.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.499
Oh, yeah?

05:32.541 --> 05:34.209
How did it turn out?
It's great!

05:34.251 --> 05:36.211
Check it out and let me know.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.172
Tell me the title, at least.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.090
It was something like...

05:41.550 --> 05:44.011
<i>The Mantra of... Perseverance...</i>

05:44.053 --> 05:45.888
<i>An Entrepreneur's Mantra.
</i> Some shit like that.

05:45.929 --> 05:46.597
<i>An Entrepreneur's Mantra?</i>

05:46.638 --> 05:47.639
Really?

05:48.599 --> 05:51.143
Lola is the best at everything,even
though she's a pain in the ass.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.603
Tell me.

05:52.644 --> 05:55.397
How's your ex-president
grandfather taking all this?

05:55.439 --> 05:58.025
He's probably pissing his pants.

05:58.067 --> 06:00.569
I don't think he's got time
to think about this bullshit.

06:00.611 --> 06:03.322
Having his grandson
called a pothead...

06:03.363 --> 06:05.991
- probably doesn't make him jump for joy.
- He can't do much, anyway.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.494
Nacho, listen.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.705
The last thing you need right now is
the SantamarÃ­as against you, bro.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.666
Why right now?

06:14.708 --> 06:17.002
Don't you know what
you're getting into?

06:17.044 --> 06:18.587
You're like a little rabbit,

06:18.629 --> 06:20.130
cute and fluffy...

06:20.172 --> 06:21.715
Who got himself
into the snake's nest.

06:21.757 --> 06:23.092
Are you saying snakes are birds?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.720
Hey, everyone is hoping
your little business fails.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.264
Who said we're going to fail?

06:29.306 --> 06:32.726
KannaLab is the only company who
hasn't closed an export deal.

06:32.768 --> 06:33.852
We're on it.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.437
We're analyzing various offers.

06:35.479 --> 06:38.732
Listen, Nacho. The longer you take,
the worse you look.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.943
And when you finally fall,

06:40.984 --> 06:44.154
and fall into that snake nest, or
whatever the fuck you wanna call it,

06:44.196 --> 06:45.614
they'll eat you alive.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.741
They're going to destroy you,
man.

06:47.783 --> 06:48.742
You'll see.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.425
This is going to be hard.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.265
You don't say.

07:11.306 --> 07:15.227
To find the exact source of the
problem, it'll have to be taken apart.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.816
This has actually
happened before.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.943
Perhaps you don't remember,
a lady who...

07:22.985 --> 07:25.696
used to live here.
Valentina? Or was it Valeria?

07:25.737 --> 07:27.447
It's the same problem.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.744
Goddammit.

07:32.786 --> 07:38.041
NOMINEES FOR THE SIMÃ“N BOLIVAR
JOURNALISM PRIZE

07:44.631 --> 07:47.509
HEY, WHY SO LOST

07:51.972 --> 07:53.098
Hey.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.350
You were right about the water.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.478
They informed me that the irrigation
canals have been aligned.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.065
Do you have more bad news, now?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.568
No.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.111
No, not at all.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.780
I wanted to let you know
you're doing a great job here.

08:08.822 --> 08:12.284
Honestly, nobody else has
what you have here.

08:12.326 --> 08:13.911
It's been a team effort, Susana.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.247
So...

08:18.415 --> 08:20.000
Do you smoke weed or not?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.754
Let's see... What do you think,
Felix?

08:24.922 --> 08:28.300
A pothead can recognize
another pothead.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.177
Potheads?

08:31.929 --> 08:32.804
Tell me the truth.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.351
How are we doing?

08:42.189 --> 08:44.149
- Mari.
- You saw my text, right?

08:44.191 --> 08:45.400
I was about to reply.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.945
We have to talk about Teo.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.572
That money was
transferred from Slovenia.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.032
That's really weird, Fefe.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.742
I don't like that guy.

08:53.784 --> 08:57.162
Well, the sooner we pay him,

08:57.204 --> 08:58.705
the sooner we get rid of him.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.541
That's exactly what I
want to talk about.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.466
these pharmaceutical companies don't
have deals with the competition.

09:09.508 --> 09:10.968
How many of them are we meeting?

09:12.135 --> 09:14.179
Don't tell me we haven't
set any meetings.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.808
No, we haven't
scheduled any yet.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.226
Then, what, man?

09:19.268 --> 09:21.520
Relax. Okay?
I've been thinking and--

09:21.561 --> 09:24.273
Ow! Nothing good starts with,
"I've been thinking."

09:24.314 --> 09:25.857
But I think you'll like this.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.193
I've been thinking...

09:30.779 --> 09:32.656
The pharmaceutical industry
is not the way.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.283
- Fuck that, Nacho.
- What do you mean?

09:34.324 --> 09:35.993
That's always been the
company's plan.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.161
Listen, everyone is kissing the
pharmaceutical industry's ass.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.955
Why? Because it's the
obvious choice.

09:39.997 --> 09:43.125
Right? It's like the right-wing candidate

09:43.166 --> 09:44.126
saying he's somewhat liberal
to get more votes,

09:44.167 --> 09:45.711
he's obviously gonna get them.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.338
Nachito isn't it obvious because
that's where the money is?

09:48.380 --> 09:50.048
No, we can make a deal with whoever
we choose.

09:51.758 --> 09:55.595
Oh, what a fabulous Pinterest
line to post on an Insta story.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.556
But, may I remind you,
we have to get back to Teo.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.599
With a million dollars, no less.

09:59.641 --> 10:02.352
Can you take a look at it?

10:06.189 --> 10:07.232
New Soul Grass?

10:07.274 --> 10:09.234
- It's Ilana Frank's company.
- Exactly.

10:09.276 --> 10:13.280
It's the only one producing
cannabis-based energy drinks.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.157
She's practically
creating the market.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.116
So?

10:16.158 --> 10:18.785
So, dude? We'll be supplying

10:18.827 --> 10:21.038
raw material to an
international company

10:21.079 --> 10:24.124
who exports cannabis-based
energy drinks worldwide.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.711
How big is the market for this?

10:27.753 --> 10:32.632
I don't know, I'm not sure. It's a
100 or 120 million people market.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.219
Okay.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.181
And how will we
contact Her Majesty?

10:39.222 --> 10:40.724
Or do you plan to kidnap her

10:40.766 --> 10:42.100
and make her buy from us only?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.311
That was my first choice, but...

10:44.353 --> 10:47.522
in the corporate world,
kidnapping is frowned upon.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.899
So...

10:48.940 --> 10:51.109
I thought I could rely
on your charm.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.070
My charm?

10:56.490 --> 10:59.326
Your Lucas works at a company

10:59.368 --> 11:01.745
which supplies equipment
to a company they work with.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.706
So what you have to do

11:04.748 --> 11:06.750
is ask your husband a favor.
Easy.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.511
It's not such a bad idea.

11:29.731 --> 11:30.690
<i>You're not coming to the
council meeting?</i>

11:30.732 --> 11:32.776
<i>That's a shame.</i>

11:32.818 --> 11:37.239
Seven privileged, middle-aged men making
all the decisions. What could go wrong?

11:37.280 --> 11:38.657
You can't say we have bad taste.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.368
They absolutely loved
your profile.

11:41.410 --> 11:43.662
I was thinking we could do
a couple more profiles.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.332
<i>You have a very
optimistic imagination.</i>

11:47.374 --> 11:48.875
If you don't wanna do that
anymore, suggest something new.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.754
What about a new perspective
on an old subject?

11:52.796 --> 11:54.923
Let me talk to Villa's
people again.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.133
<i>I swear to God...</i>

11:56.174 --> 11:57.592
Look, I get it.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.428
- If my girlfriend--
- Ex-girlfriend.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.013
<i>...was</i> <i>nominated</i> <i>for</i> <i>the</i> <i>SimÃ³n
Bolivar</i> <i>prize</i> <i>thanks</i> <i>to</i> <i>my</i> <i>work,</i>

12:02.055 --> 12:03.598
<i>I would kill myself.</i>

12:03.640 --> 12:05.517
You have to know
when to give up sometimes, Lola.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.477
Do you wanna bring up
ex-girlfriends?

12:07.519 --> 12:09.396
<i>We could talk about yours.</i>

12:09.438 --> 12:11.898
<i>About the leaked photo of her
with three soccer players.</i>

12:11.940 --> 12:15.235
Listen. You have 24 hours
to come up with a new subject.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.237
Or you'll be working
on a cricket player profile

12:17.279 --> 12:19.573
who's big in Europe,
so you get off my case.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.173
Mr. SantamarÃ­a?

12:36.214 --> 12:39.426
<i>Perseverance... An
Entrepreneur's Motto.</i>

12:39.468 --> 12:43.847
<i>The</i> <i>Ventures</i> <i>of</i> <i>a</i> <i>Fucking</i> <i>Rich
Kid</i> wasn't available, I imagine.

12:43.889 --> 12:44.431
Or was it too shocking?

12:46.141 --> 12:50.020
That was my first choice, but you
should meet my lovely editors.

12:50.061 --> 12:50.729
<i>I have another question.</i>

12:52.147 --> 12:55.233
How mad will you get
if I invite you for lunch today?

12:55.275 --> 12:56.860
<i>What for?</i>

12:57.486 --> 12:58.987
Well, to...

12:59.029 --> 13:01.948
- thank you for taking the time--
<i>-You only give thanks</i>

13:01.990 --> 13:03.325
when someone does you a favor.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.077
If that's what you think I did,
you're wrong.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.412
<i>No, no...</i>

13:07.454 --> 13:09.331
I don't doubt your
professional ethics.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.290
<i>That's what it sounded like.</i>

13:10.332 --> 13:12.083
Then I take it back.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.504
<i>What</i> <i>if</i> <i>I</i> <i>take</i> <i>you</i> <i>to</i> <i>lunch</i> <i>to
apologize</i> <i>for</i> <i>making</i> <i>you</i> <i>think</i>

13:15.545 --> 13:16.880
<i>I was returning a favor?</i>

13:16.922 --> 13:18.715
That's different.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.010
So what do you say?
Lunch?

13:23.136 --> 13:26.181
I can't. I'm kidnapped
in my own house.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.231
Don't add any more spice.
I overdid it.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.316
Oh, you're always exaggerating.

13:36.358 --> 13:39.528
Exaggerating? We will pay for the
consequences later.

13:39.569 --> 13:40.820
Excuse me?

13:40.862 --> 13:43.114
What consequences are we talking about?
Tell me.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.366
I'm just saying.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.784
You'll suffer the consequences.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.994
- Don't play dumb, sir.
- This is what I put up with.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.496
Oh, honey.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.624
Is that your dad?

13:53.750 --> 13:55.168
Pick it up.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.294
I don't feel
like talking to him right now.

13:57.879 --> 14:01.132
Perhaps he wants to make peace
and that's why he's calling.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.637
All right. I won't get involved.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.808
Hey, does the name Ilana Frank
sound familiar?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.519
Sure.
She's one of our clients, why?

14:15.188 --> 14:18.650
We're considering her as a
potential partner for KannaLab.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.569
Partner?

14:20.610 --> 14:22.362
What happened with the
pharmaceutical companies?

14:23.697 --> 14:25.073
We want to test...

14:25.115 --> 14:26.032
other roads.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.117
What do you mean?

14:27.158 --> 14:28.535
Do you have her contact info?

14:29.869 --> 14:32.247
No. That's Samantha's account.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.625
Can you please help
me with that?

14:35.667 --> 14:36.876
- Getting her info?
- Yes, with her.

14:36.918 --> 14:37.961
No!

14:38.003 --> 14:39.796
I would rather not right now.

14:39.838 --> 14:42.924
Lucas, you know I wouldn't ask
if this wasn't important to me.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.302
Well, perhaps in a month,

14:45.343 --> 14:46.469
when things are less crazy.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.305
We don't have a month, really.

14:50.932 --> 14:53.602
Mari, I'd rather not do
that right now.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.645
Let's not argue about this.

14:55.687 --> 14:56.855
We're doing fine.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.607
We're in peace.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.775
We're gonna eat something nice.
Okay?

15:22.255 --> 15:23.673
I'm here to pay the rescue.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.638
Before you would get millions,

15:29.679 --> 15:30.930
now you get a
fucking doggie bag?

15:32.474 --> 15:34.893
That's right. Even the
<i>Mona</i> <i>Lisa</i> has depreciated.

15:39.522 --> 15:40.857
Oh, so it was true?

15:43.485 --> 15:45.945
Let's see what the palace
chef prepared.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.697
This only gets prepared

15:47.739 --> 15:49.699
when the president
himself asks for it.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.993
Where's the lobster with
truffle sauce?

15:52.035 --> 15:55.372
Please, have some respect.
There's no point in comparison.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.165
This is from my childhood.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.668
We used to go here for lunch
with my nanny every Saturday

15:59.709 --> 16:02.170
and let me tell you,
it's fucking delicious.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.298
Absent parents and a
surrogate nanny.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.758
Who would've thought?

16:08.510 --> 16:11.721
What did Mr. SantamarÃ­a think
about your underdeveloped palate?

16:12.806 --> 16:15.183
We buried Mr.
SantamarÃ­a long ago.

16:17.602 --> 16:18.478
I'm sorry.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.106
It's the circle of life.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.023
It's not the end of the world.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.026
What did you come for?

16:26.778 --> 16:28.905
It's obvious I didn't come
to thank you for the article.

16:30.031 --> 16:31.574
It's obvious we won't
be having sex.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.828
No? Why? Why is that?
What did I do wrong?

16:34.869 --> 16:37.330
No woman can resist
the aphrodisiac substances

16:37.372 --> 16:39.999
in these hamburgers and my
depressing childhood stories.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.503
You're not doing great.

16:45.463 --> 16:46.464
Really?

16:47.716 --> 16:49.759
I thought the exact opposite.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.808
Not to ruin the moment, but there's
a man staring at us holding a mop.

16:58.309 --> 17:02.731
<i>Miss Lola, could you hold
this light here for me?</i>

17:30.842 --> 17:32.218
Hold still.

17:34.763 --> 17:35.889
Hold still.

17:41.311 --> 17:42.812
I'm not moving.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.652
Shine it here!

17:51.112 --> 17:52.071
Hold still.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.657
Is it gonna be much longer?

17:54.699 --> 17:57.535
Well, I think a couple of hours.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.586
You're gonna have to
come back later.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.593
Okay.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.577
I don't understand why
you returned to the country.

18:40.537 --> 18:41.830
What do you mean?

18:41.871 --> 18:44.415
Look. He leaves the country,

18:44.457 --> 18:47.669
returns after five years to start
a company with the ex-girlfriend

18:47.710 --> 18:49.629
who was the reason for leaving
in the first place.

18:49.671 --> 18:50.964
You know what I mean?

18:51.005 --> 18:52.257
How does that affect you?

18:52.298 --> 18:54.759
It doesn't.
Whatever you decide to do

18:54.801 --> 18:56.678
doesn't get to me anymore.

18:56.719 --> 18:57.971
I have my own life.

18:58.012 --> 19:00.098
Oh, how nice. That's great.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.519
Carmenza agreed to come with me
to Italy, for starters.

19:06.104 --> 19:08.398
So you're still going to Italy?

19:08.439 --> 19:11.901
Of course, I am, Felix.
Please, it's all planned out.

19:11.943 --> 19:14.571
Why don't we wait to see
how things will turn out?

19:14.612 --> 19:16.322
And how will they turn out?

19:18.825 --> 19:21.870
No, I don't mean this. You'll
be great in a couple of months.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.538
I'm doing wonderful.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.084
I'm talking about money, Mom.

19:29.794 --> 19:33.339
The lawyer suggested
we lower our expenses while...

19:34.883 --> 19:36.676
while the dispute settles.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.344
A lawyer's not gonna tell me

19:38.386 --> 19:40.263
how to spend the money
my husband left me.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.269
Why don't we talk about
this at home?

19:52.025 --> 19:53.401
What are you doing? Mom?

19:53.443 --> 19:55.820
Mom, what are you...?
You're going to hurt yourself.

19:55.862 --> 19:56.863
What are you doing?

19:57.780 --> 19:58.823
Nurse!

20:03.453 --> 20:06.247
How could you do that, Mom?
You're going to hurt yourself!

20:06.289 --> 20:07.165
More?

20:08.458 --> 20:09.626
There's no money.

20:09.667 --> 20:10.835
What are you talking about?

20:10.877 --> 20:11.920
The lawyer said
there's no money.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.839
We'll ask him and he'll
clear things up.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.674
The dispute wasn't settled.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.717
We're broke.

20:23.598 --> 20:24.641
I don't understand.

20:24.682 --> 20:25.767
How else can I say it?

20:25.808 --> 20:27.644
We're bankrupt.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.230
And there are more important things
right now

20:31.272 --> 20:33.191
than a fucking trip to Italy.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.835
DID YOU FIND MY NECKLACE?
HELP ME OUT.

20:56.923 --> 21:00.051
DID YOU FIND MY NECKLACE?
HELP ME OUT.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.062
Those are a lot of books
on the same subject.

21:13.523 --> 21:16.567
Bukowski said to find what you love
and let it kill you.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.654
I think you're on
the right path.

21:24.367 --> 21:27.245
Some of us have to jump
when we see a cliff.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.914
Isn't that a tragic path?

21:31.207 --> 21:33.835
We're all full of tragedy,
but very few of us

21:33.876 --> 21:35.545
are realistic enough
to admit it.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.589
What about that thing
called hope?

21:40.550 --> 21:41.384
No.

21:42.427 --> 21:43.553
Not in this house.

21:44.721 --> 21:45.722
Or in this life.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.391
Where, then?

21:48.850 --> 21:49.726
Far.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.310
- How far?
- Thailand.

21:51.352 --> 21:52.478
Thailand?

21:52.520 --> 21:53.896
In front of the sea.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.816
The sea cures it all?

21:57.608 --> 21:59.318
- No.
- Yes.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.988
KannaLab was born by the sea.

22:03.281 --> 22:04.741
Wasn't it in BogotÃ¡?

22:06.743 --> 22:07.994
Yes, it was in BogotÃ¡.

22:08.036 --> 22:09.328
I got confused.

22:10.621 --> 22:12.248
What's stopping you
from going to Thailand?

22:15.043 --> 22:17.086
The real answer is
I have to work to live.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.798
The ideal answer is
it would be an easy way out.

22:22.175 --> 22:24.218
What's easy about leaving
everything behind?

22:26.054 --> 22:27.805
You don't leave a trace
when you flee.

22:35.980 --> 22:36.981
I like your lips.

22:44.822 --> 22:45.531
Hey.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.451
I said I liked them,
not that I wanted to kiss them.

22:48.493 --> 22:50.661
Too late for regrets.

23:05.468 --> 23:09.305
Your mom just asked me
to discontinue the chemotherapy.

23:09.347 --> 23:11.808
All because of a fucking
trip to Italy.

23:11.849 --> 23:15.603
Look, I've seen people die
because they can't eat a

23:15.645 --> 23:16.938
hamburger. People need...

23:16.979 --> 23:18.898
motivation, a reason to fight.

23:18.940 --> 23:21.150
And if you take that away,
they give in, give up.

23:22.860 --> 23:26.447
How can I have money for a trip
if I can't afford chemotherapy?

23:28.282 --> 23:30.868
Will she ever realize she can't
let herself die for this?

23:32.495 --> 23:36.833
She needs something else to
uplift her, I can't deal anymore.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.684
KANNALAB WAS BORN AT THE BEACH

23:54.725 --> 23:56.352
<i>And, eight months ago...</i>

23:56.394 --> 23:59.981
<i>it was Mariana's birthday,
on March 8th, to be exact.</i>

24:00.022 --> 24:02.233
<i>And we hadn't hung out
in a long time.</i>

24:02.275 --> 24:03.192
<i>Where?</i>

24:04.235 --> 24:05.695
<i>Here, in BogotÃ¡.</i>

24:10.616 --> 24:12.702
KANNALAB WAS BORN ON A BEACH
- ORIGIN: MAY 8
- TH

24:12.743 --> 24:13.703
MARIANA'S BIRTHDAY

24:20.793 --> 24:22.628
- NO POSTS FROM THE 8
- TH OF MARCH

25:01.334 --> 25:02.710
<i>The sea cures it all?</i>

25:02.752 --> 25:04.670
<i>Kannalab was born by the sea.</i>

25:11.219 --> 25:13.387
<i>And we hadn't hung out
in a long time.</i>

25:13.429 --> 25:14.513
<i>Where?</i>

25:15.473 --> 25:17.642
<i>Here, in BogotÃ¡.</i>

25:56.555 --> 26:03.437
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

26:12.863 --> 26:14.740
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

27:03.664 --> 27:04.498
What's up?

27:05.541 --> 27:07.585
Shit, it's freezing!

27:07.626 --> 27:09.670
That must be why they call
this city The Freezer.

27:09.712 --> 27:10.629
Oh, yes.

27:12.757 --> 27:14.133
So... How's the
marijuana life going?

27:15.468 --> 27:17.887
It's going.
You wanna get a drink?

27:18.679 --> 27:20.264
No. I don't feel like it.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.766
Not even a coffee?

27:21.807 --> 27:24.518
No, let's hang some other time.
I have a lot to do.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.062
All right.

27:32.610 --> 27:33.736
You know what, kid?

27:34.945 --> 27:37.448
I'm going to leave so
people don't think

27:37.490 --> 27:39.033
I'm trying to mug you in here.

27:39.075 --> 27:40.493
- I'll see you in a month.
- Hey.

27:41.202 --> 27:42.828
How's the man doing?

27:44.663 --> 27:46.791
I've told you not to ask about him
many times.

27:48.542 --> 27:51.295
You're doing more than enough,
believe me.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.174
Goodbye.

28:11.607 --> 28:13.025
- Can I help you?
- No.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.155
I'll be late.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.227
You're a little early but--

30:53.269 --> 30:55.771
- I'm sorry!
- No, Samantha, don't say that.

30:55.813 --> 30:56.939
We're all set for you,

30:56.981 --> 30:58.190
- we have some snacks.
- So nice, thanks.

30:58.232 --> 30:59.942
Daniel, so nice, thank you.

30:59.984 --> 31:01.735
Oh, the apartment is amazing!

31:01.777 --> 31:03.153
Thank you!

31:03.195 --> 31:04.530
Make yourself at home, welcome.

31:04.572 --> 31:05.531
Samantha?

31:05.573 --> 31:06.615
Hi, Lucas.

31:06.657 --> 31:08.617
- What's up?
- It's really beautiful.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.160
Daniel.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.453
Wine, anyone? I'm
opening a Malbec,

31:11.495 --> 31:12.830
my favorite. If you want,

31:12.871 --> 31:13.956
- we can try this one after.
- I want some.

31:13.998 --> 31:15.040
- Right away.
- Thanks!

31:15.082 --> 31:16.667
Yes, of course.

31:16.709 --> 31:19.545
You wouldn't have let me invite them
if I told you, so...

31:20.796 --> 31:23.257
You know how tense
things are with her.

31:23.299 --> 31:25.342
That's precisely why.

31:25.384 --> 31:30.514
We can smooth things out and you
will become boss of the year.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.933
What are you doing here,
brother?

32:20.356 --> 32:22.691
Do you know what could happen
if these people

32:22.733 --> 32:24.610
find out you're out here?

32:25.986 --> 32:27.404
Kid...

32:27.446 --> 32:28.864
don't be a dumbass.

32:29.907 --> 32:31.742
Get out of here.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.035
Go live your life.

32:34.870 --> 32:35.704
Go.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.492
No, thank you.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.289
Been waiting all day
for this moment.

33:20.708 --> 33:22.918
How so? You can still smoke
during the day, right?

33:25.295 --> 33:27.214
He always says I smell
like cigarettes.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.218
Unbelievable.

33:31.260 --> 33:33.762
No matter what you do, you still
have to ask for permission.

33:35.556 --> 33:39.059
I imagine that choosing to be
independent wasn't an easy decision.

33:40.436 --> 33:42.146
It never is.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.152
It must not be easy, either...

33:48.193 --> 33:51.029
to lose a position
that you're the best fit for.

33:53.490 --> 33:54.867
Don't let your husband hear you.

33:57.202 --> 34:00.539
He knows that in a couple of years
you'll be president of the company.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.003
I don't know why I feel like...

34:06.044 --> 34:08.672
all this flattery should come
with the dessert,

34:08.714 --> 34:10.466
and we're still not there yet.

34:10.507 --> 34:14.386
All I've said so far is true.

34:14.428 --> 34:16.430
Then we can keep talking inside.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.399
Ilana Frank.

34:27.441 --> 34:28.859
What about her?

34:28.901 --> 34:31.069
You have a business relationship
with her company, right?

34:31.111 --> 34:33.864
- Do you need a recommendation?
- I need her personal info.

34:36.575 --> 34:37.534
I can't believe it.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.913
Did you bad-mouth Lucas
to get a contact?

34:40.954 --> 34:43.749
I didn't bad-mouth my husband.
I'm just speaking nicely of you.

34:43.791 --> 34:45.667
I'm just not the type of woman

34:45.709 --> 34:48.086
who does charity
in exchange for flattery.

34:50.464 --> 34:52.299
We could talk money, then.

35:00.808 --> 35:03.143
I'm not a slut who sells herself
for money, either.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.065
The food was very nice.

35:32.631 --> 35:33.507
Mom!

35:34.049 --> 35:35.092
Mom!

35:35.592 --> 35:36.718
Mom!

35:55.237 --> 35:56.530
We had a nice time today.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.243
What a good idea to
invite Samantha.

36:02.703 --> 36:03.579
Yes.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.122
You know what I was thinking?

36:06.373 --> 36:08.834
Why don't we go to a
fertility doctor?

36:10.043 --> 36:10.794
You think?

36:12.087 --> 36:15.465
Why force things?
Let's go with the flow, no?

36:15.507 --> 36:18.552
- I agree, go with the flow.
- Right.

36:18.594 --> 36:21.054
But we've tried for a long time,

36:21.096 --> 36:22.639
and nothing happens.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.767
And, honestly, I'm worried
that there's a problem.

36:27.019 --> 36:30.564
What problem?
We're both in perfect shape.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.149
Nothing's wrong.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.026
I know, I'm sure there's
nothing wrong.

36:34.067 --> 36:38.155
It doesn't hurt to hear
an expert's opinion, either.

36:40.032 --> 36:41.325
Really?

36:45.037 --> 36:46.121
Okay.

36:46.163 --> 36:47.623
If it'll put you at ease...

36:48.832 --> 36:50.876
All right. Let's make
an appointment.

36:54.421 --> 36:55.839
We're a great team.

37:04.473 --> 37:05.265
What happened to her?

37:06.308 --> 37:08.185
She suffered liver
failure which,

37:08.226 --> 37:10.312
combined with the wine,
made her pass out.

37:10.354 --> 37:12.606
Has her cancer metastasized?

37:12.648 --> 37:16.318
You know, chemotherapy
is poison attacking live cells.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.403
Your mom suspended
the treatment,

37:18.445 --> 37:21.698
so her body didn't get
enough medicine

37:21.740 --> 37:24.117
to protect her vital organs.

37:24.159 --> 37:27.287
Listen, Felix. Eva needs to resume
her treatment as soon as possible.

37:28.872 --> 37:31.833
Today we were lucky to save her,
but tomorrow we don't know.

38:15.836 --> 38:19.798
THANK YOU.

38:24.845 --> 38:30.392
BE CAREFUL WITH HER.

38:35.272 --> 38:36.356
What's so urgent?

38:39.067 --> 38:40.902
How much would you pay
for the weed?

38:48.618 --> 38:51.580
Miss, Lola. It's ready. Look.

38:52.456 --> 38:53.749
This was the whole problem.

38:54.875 --> 38:56.918
It got tangled and so
did the food.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.670
It was that fucking necklace.

39:00.630 --> 39:01.548
Do you like it?

39:04.092 --> 39:05.427
Take it.

39:05.469 --> 39:06.678
<i>With your permission.</i>

39:06.720 --> 39:07.929
Thanks.
