WEBVTT

02:22.360 --> 02:23.407
Thank you, Grace,

02:23.560 --> 02:26.689
for that lovely a cappella version
of the National Anthem.

02:27.160 --> 02:31.404
Please welcome to the stage a student
who needs no introduction,

02:31.560 --> 02:36.566
however, she did write one
for me to read to you. Ahem.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.411
"Today's keynote speaker
holds the highest GPA

02:39.560 --> 02:41.767
in the history of Merriwether High.

02:41.920 --> 02:46.050
As president of Mathletes, Key Club
treasurer, editor of the school paper

02:46.240 --> 02:51.201
<i>as well as her own self-published
magazine Womyn With a Y,</i>

02:51.400 --> 02:54.927
please put your hands
together, oh,

02:55.080 --> 02:57.686
but remain seated
so those behind you can see,

02:57.880 --> 03:02.090
this year's Valedictorian,
Brandy Klark."

03:04.120 --> 03:05.451
Go, Pancake.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.289
Please be quiet.

03:10.960 --> 03:15.090
Our First Lady,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, once said:

03:15.240 --> 03:19.131
"You cannot be both young and wise."

03:19.280 --> 03:22.250
I say, let's prove her wrong.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.209
Get off the stage, virgin.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.886
What a loser.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.769
Thank you. That's great.

03:38.920 --> 03:42.481
Nice speech, spaz. What, you have
like a death wish or something?

03:42.640 --> 03:44.722
Good chime-in.
No, I don't have a death wish.

03:44.920 --> 03:48.242
- Amber, be nice to your sister.
- Hey, Brandy. Brandy.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.528
Hey, Brandy.
Hey, Cameron.

03:52.960 --> 03:56.169
Killer speech. Really inspirational.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.402
Your hair smells good.
What is it, lavender?

03:58.560 --> 04:02.645
Who is this? Who are you?
Oh, hi. Cameron Mitchell, sir.

04:02.840 --> 04:06.606
George, it's Cameron.
Brandy's science lab partner.

04:06.760 --> 04:07.807
AP Chemistry partner.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.007
He is?
Yes.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.766
Dad.
What?

04:10.920 --> 04:12.968
It's Cameron.
Okay.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.600
Can I talk to you for a second, please?
Yeah.

04:15.840 --> 04:19.083
Um... So it was really rad
studying with you this year.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.925
I'm so psyched that we'll be
working together at the pool.

04:22.079 --> 04:24.526
Oh, me too.
And we're going to Georgetown together.

04:24.680 --> 04:28.321
I mean, you got a full ride,
I got a partial, but whatever.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.767
I think that fate
is trying to tell us something.

04:30.920 --> 04:33.400
Barf. Two nerds in love.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.040
Shut up.
Our relationship is strictly professional.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.680
We're just friends. God, I hate you.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.806
So sorry, Cameron.
No, that's okay.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.371
You were saying- Uh...

04:44.520 --> 04:47.171
I was just saying that I think that...

04:47.360 --> 04:51.843
I wanted just to give you this.
Oh, thanks. Socks.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.049
Actually, those are slippers,
and they're for your dorm room--

04:58.080 --> 04:59.764
We did it.

05:00.840 --> 05:01.887
Oh, my God.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.361
The slutty Oompa Loompas.
Honey.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.205
Can we get out of this family fuck-fest
and go to a party?

05:07.360 --> 05:09.522
Hey, Judge.
Hi, Mrs. Klark.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.245
Hey, go fuck yourself.

05:16.440 --> 05:20.411
Dude, you don't give the chick
you're crushing on socks.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.881
They're slippers, actually.
Oh, whatever, man.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.930
You give her girly shit,
like perfume or a scrunchie.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.686
Brandy is not a girlie girl.
She's hard to read.

05:28.840 --> 05:31.764
Sometimes I think she likes me,
sometimes I think she's a robot.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.605
Oh, I knew it. She's a lesbo.
She's not a lesbo.

05:35.960 --> 05:40.090
Oh, shit. Just got a page. Let's jet.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.084
You don't really think she's a lesbo?
I kind of do.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.210
I have to register, contact my
dorm mate, label my clothes--

05:49.360 --> 05:51.681
And see Beaches. I got it on VHS.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.287
We have to have a special sleepover
to watch it before we leave, okay?

05:55.440 --> 05:57.249
- Special sleepover?
- Yes.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.880
God, you're so weird.
Okay, Wendy, "Watch Beaches."

06:00.040 --> 06:01.690
I'll put it on the list.
Thank you.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.804
Save money for computer.
That'll take forever. Buy shower shoes.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.928
You know how much bacteria
is in communal showers?

06:07.080 --> 06:09.970
If you don't bring your own shoes--
God, stop. Put it away.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.771
Put it away. All right?
You're being a buzz kill.

06:13.160 --> 06:17.085
Okay. Guess it can wait.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.087
I am excited for the all-night
graduation party.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.527
Those Mormons have some
great activities planned.

06:22.840 --> 06:26.606
And I think it's the perfect alternative
to Derrick Bergwill's stupid kegger.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.081
I mean, who needs alcohol
when there's a hypnotist?

06:30.480 --> 06:32.801
Fiona, you missed the turn.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.248
Hey, seriously,
you missed the turn. Hey.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.804
What the H-E-double hockey sticks.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.163
Told you she'd freak. She almost swore.
Better turn around, Fiona.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.482
There is no way
I am turning this car around.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.849
Pancake, I'm taking you to a real party.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.288
Booyah. Class of '93, fucktards.
Whoo!

06:51.480 --> 06:53.482
<i>Drink, drink, drink, drink!</i>

06:53.680 --> 06:55.569
<i>Drink, drink, drink, drink!</i>

06:58.520 --> 07:00.761
- You guys suck.
- Dicks.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.160
Hey. Ha, ha.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.288
I'm out of here.
Let's get our drink on.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.561
Excuse me.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.321
Fiona, my dad is a judge.
He'd be so disappointed.

07:08.520 --> 07:11.000
You know, Brandy,
in Europe there's no drinking age.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.771
Parents give their babies wine and shit.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.969
Twenty-one is, like,
such an arbitrary age, because it's, like,

07:17.160 --> 07:22.564
you can go to war and die,
but you can't have a little drink now?

07:22.920 --> 07:26.891
Look, you know I hate hypocritical laws,
but, Fiona, you are driving.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.326
Okay, okay, okay.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.562
I'm throwing this out.
No.

07:36.320 --> 07:41.690
Who is that?
That is Rusty Waters.

08:34.799 --> 08:35.926
We can stay.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.844
<i>Chug, chug, chug, chug!</i>

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
<i>Chug, chug, chug, Chug!</i>

08:59.240 --> 09:02.642
Yes.
Here's to pussy.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.129
Oh, God. What is that?
That's disgusting.

09:06.280 --> 09:09.045
Peach schnapps. The only thing my dad
wouldn't miss from the liquor cabinet.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.441
I'm sticking to beer.
I'll stick to schnapps.

09:11.920 --> 09:15.049
I can't feel my legs.
You're like after-school-special drunk.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.410
Beer should be a food group.
Am I right?

09:18.560 --> 09:20.164
Uh-huh.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.450
I like being on the top bunk.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.086
- If you fart, I'll kill you.
- Ladies don't fart.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.084
- Don't-- Ew.
- Except this one.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.843
- Sleep well, drunkie.
- I love you.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.490
I love you too.
We love you.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.010
Whoo!

09:37.160 --> 09:41.722
We're gonna go party now. Bye.
I've made it to the top.

09:41.880 --> 09:45.168
Guys are gone? It's all good.

09:45.320 --> 09:48.449
Let's play a game. I hide, you seek.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.922
Here's a hint, I'll be in bed.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.367
Hey, who are you?

09:56.880 --> 09:58.530
<i>I know you are, but what am I?</i>

10:06.320 --> 10:11.360
Oh, I should do this more often.
Getting drunk is fun.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.842
Oh, yeah? It's about to get
a whole lot funner.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.528
You mean, more fun.
"Funner" is not a word.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.211
Ooh...

10:28.360 --> 10:30.249
You feel like Marky Mark looks.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.681
Oh, yeah?
How about some good vibrations?

10:41.160 --> 10:42.366
You ready for some more?

10:42.520 --> 10:44.682
Yeah. As long as you don't
have oral herpes.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.171
Wait.

10:49.360 --> 10:53.729
Who the fuck are you?
Brandy Klark, Valedictorian.

10:54.480 --> 10:58.565
Yeah, you're not who I was looking for.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.924
Nice to meet you.

11:04.360 --> 11:08.809
Why am I so stupid?
What was I thinking?

11:08.960 --> 11:13.249
That it tastes better on the way down
than it does coming up? Jesus.

11:13.440 --> 11:17.047
Your vomit's the color of Kermit the Frog.
Why did I say that?

11:17.200 --> 11:20.010
Why didn't I just keep
kissing him back?

11:20.200 --> 11:22.931
Excuse me?
Who the fuck did you kiss?

11:23.680 --> 11:26.923
Whom.
Whom the fuck did you kiss, Brandy?

11:27.120 --> 11:30.203
Whom the fuck did you kiss, Brandy?
Brandy.

11:30.360 --> 11:33.443
Whom the fuck did you kiss?
Rusty Waters.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.570
What? No.
Shut up.

11:36.800 --> 11:40.441
Are you serious?
I've never felt that way before.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.967
What, horny?
Yeah, welcome to puberty, man.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.531
No.

11:45.400 --> 11:49.325
Like nervous.
Like I didn't know what to do.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.488
I always know what to do. Always.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.803
So you're saying
that you kissed Rusty Waters...

11:56.360 --> 11:58.567
but you didn't put out?
Are you crazy?

11:58.720 --> 12:00.609
Or a lesbian.
No.

12:00.760 --> 12:04.481
I wanted to put it out.
I didn't know how.

12:04.640 --> 12:08.406
What do you mean you didn't know how?
He kisses you, you just kiss him back.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.130
I mean, it's not that hard.

12:10.280 --> 12:14.080
Unless you're good at it,
and then it is hard. Do you get it?

12:14.240 --> 12:16.163
Wendy.
I mean his dick.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.882
Guys, this is serious.

12:19.040 --> 12:22.203
The last time I Frenched
was with Jason Swan in ninth grade.

12:22.360 --> 12:26.126
We had to end our relationship because
it interfered with student-council duties.

12:26.280 --> 12:29.011
You could've gone all the way
if you didn't lose your shit.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.766
Can you imagine losing your V card
to a college guy?

12:31.920 --> 12:34.526
No premature ejaculation.
He'd hit your G spot.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.889
Yeah, you'd probably come
like three times.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.044
Come where?

12:42.160 --> 12:44.527
Really? That's a" Orgasm.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.524
You think if I'd been ready
and wanted to and not so drunk,

12:47.680 --> 12:50.206
had protection and maybe a cute bra,
we could've--?

12:50.360 --> 12:51.805
Fucked?

12:52.520 --> 12:55.205
Yeah. Totally.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.203
You blew, like, a major opportunity.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.523
I mean, there's nothing wrong
with being a late bloomer, Pancake,

13:00.680 --> 13:04.651
but let's face it,
you're not getting any younger.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.322
I kissed his nipple.
What?

13:08.480 --> 13:11.689
I think I sucked on it.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.850
That's okay.
But I don't know why.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.081
Hey, could you get me a coffee?

13:37.720 --> 13:39.563
Ugh. You smell like patchouli.

13:42.120 --> 13:46.011
Good morning. Why is Chip
shaving his legs in the bathroom?

13:46.160 --> 13:48.401
Because he mountain bikes, duh.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.683
Chip spent the night, sweetheart.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.080
Chip did what?

13:52.240 --> 13:55.244
He spent the night.
He's going off on some big fishing trip.

13:55.400 --> 13:59.041
They won't see each other all summer.
He's following Phish, as in the band.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.601
You gave Amber permission
to have a boy sleep over?

14:01.760 --> 14:02.966
He's a man.
In her bed?

14:03.120 --> 14:06.841
Not a boy, it's her fiance. Where else
am I gonna have him sleep, on the couch?

14:07.000 --> 14:10.402
Why the heck not?
How was your little church party?

14:11.760 --> 14:15.481
I wouldn't know.
Fiona and Wendy took me to a kegger,

14:15.640 --> 14:18.610
I got drunk and puked my brains out.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.203
You should probably ground me.
Mom, do we have ginger ale?

14:22.360 --> 14:24.283
Let me see, honey.
Dumb-ass.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.602
Are you still drunk?
Don't tell them that.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.009
Brandy tells us everything.
Too much, if you ask me.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.606
And we trust her to make
the right decisions.

14:32.760 --> 14:35.411
Or, at least, learn from her mistakes.
Right, honey?

14:35.600 --> 14:37.409
You need to learn how to lie.

14:37.600 --> 14:41.764
She does not need to lie.
In this house, honesty is the only policy.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.803
- That's right.
- There you go, honey.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.440
And we think this hangover
is punishment enough.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.080
You're not even grounding her?
Un-fucking believable.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.169
- Hey!
- Language.

15:05.560 --> 15:09.645
Sorry I'm late. I experimented with alcohol
last night and puked on my way here.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.683
I had to stop for mouth wash.

15:11.840 --> 15:14.844
My name is--
Brandy Klark. Yeah, I remember.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.211
Do you ever wear a shirt?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.843
Very funny. Heh.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.843
Man, last night was embarrassing.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.965
You must think I'm some type
of sex maniac or something,

15:31.120 --> 15:35.682
but I promise you, next time, I will ask
before I strip down and start kissing you.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.690
Okay.
Anyway,

15:38.840 --> 15:41.207
I take it you're here
for lifeguard orientation.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.768
How did you know?
Tsk.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.681
All right, then. Let's go meet the boss.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.369
This is the pool manager?
Shh. He is sleeping.

15:55.960 --> 15:58.088
Yeah, I can see that.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.527
Excuse me. Sir?

16:00.680 --> 16:02.364
Excuse me.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.205
Hello.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.211
Excuse me. Hi.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.210
Rise and shine.
Shh. Shh.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.244
This is... It's all happ--
It's all happening.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.246
It's a happy...
Excuse me. I think you're dreaming.

16:17.400 --> 16:21.485
Ow.
Please stop. Stop it. Please.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.251
Hi.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.401
Hi. I'm Brandy.
Brandy Klark?

16:34.080 --> 16:37.687
It's orientation.
She's a newbie. Cut her some slack.

16:38.720 --> 16:41.724
Cut me some slack?
Correct me if I'm wrong,

16:41.880 --> 16:45.726
but I think we're here to work,
not hang out and get a suntan.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.924
You guys.
Hair of the dog...

16:50.080 --> 16:53.368
I can't believe you're drinking that.
Do you know what time it is?

16:56.320 --> 16:59.642
No. I partied on Friday.
What day is it?

16:59.800 --> 17:02.371
It's Monday.
Fucking A, man.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.488
All right, I better get to work.

17:05.640 --> 17:06.686
Have at it,

17:06.839 --> 17:08.365
newbie.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.647
You expect me to clean up
all that by myself?

17:10.839 --> 17:12.365
Yes.
I can help you.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.807
No, you won't.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.329
I was thinking the
colors for the wedding,

17:31.480 --> 17:32.641
burnt sienna and turquoise.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.962
Do they have burnt sienna flowers?
I don't know.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.805
- Hi, sweetie. Dinner is waiting.
- Hi.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.644
Sorry I'm late.
Hey, sweetie.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.167
Good evening.
How was lifeguard orientation?

17:43.280 --> 17:45.044
Humiliating.
Hmm.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.328
My burn-out boss
decided to make fun of me

17:47.480 --> 17:50.165
in front of this
incredibly hot college guy.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.402
Ah-ha. Shocker.

17:52.840 --> 17:56.322
Mom, when exactly
did you lose your virginity?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.960
On our wedding night.
Pass the potatoes, please.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.851
George.
The potatoes, Jean. Please?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.002
Oh, honestly.
Thank you.

18:04.520 --> 18:07.330
Way to go, dumb-ass.
Shut the front door, Amber.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.171
Shut the back door, Brandy.
Not the back door.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.765
What? Not the back door.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.730
There's doors we don't do.
The back door's one of them.

18:20.720 --> 18:24.247
It's the'90s.
You'll have to get with the times.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.529
Fine, we can get call waiting.
I'm not talking about call waiting.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.081
I'm talking about Brandy.

18:30.240 --> 18:34.131
She's clearly curious about sex.
I think I should talk to her.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.170
No. No talk.
Your talks do more harm than good.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.291
What's that supposed to mean?

18:39.440 --> 18:42.489
It means, you had a talk with Amber
and look how that turned out.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.842
You put her on the pill
when she was 15

18:45.000 --> 18:48.288
and she's been dating,
pardon my French, jerks ever since.

18:48.480 --> 18:52.724
And now she's gonna marry one.
You can't blame Chip on me.

18:52.880 --> 18:56.202
Anyway, what do you expect, Brandy's
gonna wait till her wedding night?

18:56.720 --> 18:58.722
It worked for you.

19:02.040 --> 19:05.965
Let's see.
I lost my virginity when I was 15.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.731
Fifteen?
No, actually 14, with Francois.

19:09.120 --> 19:12.567
Our exchange student?
But he was so rude.

19:12.720 --> 19:17.851
He always played his stereo too loud.
He never let me in his roo-- Touche.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.766
He had a big dick. Yeah, Francois,
you know, sex wasn't that bad

19:21.920 --> 19:23.922
but it didn't get good
until sophomore year.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.163
College, okay, that makes sense.
You're more mature--

19:27.320 --> 19:31.769
High school. By then, the guys had cars.
We would park at Beaver Creek.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.890
Do people still do that,
go to Beaver Creek to fuck?

19:35.080 --> 19:38.766
How would I know?
Oh, shit, right. Virgin. Ha, ha.

19:38.920 --> 19:42.288
Man, it feels good to finally be smarter
at something than my kid sister.

19:42.760 --> 19:46.606
Loser. Seriously, you wanna pop
that cherry before you get to college.

19:46.760 --> 19:48.125
Before? Why?

19:48.280 --> 19:51.841
Okay, how can I put this in terms
a Mathlete understands?

19:52.040 --> 19:56.045
Yes, in terms a Mathlete understands.
I'm fucking trying, okay?

19:56.200 --> 20:01.570
Freshman year is like
one big sexual pop quiz.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.888
You need to do your homework.
Homework?

20:04.040 --> 20:08.921
Yeah. God, it's crazy, freshman year.
I fucked my R.A. the first week.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.647
Wonder what she's up to.
It was a girl?

20:12.800 --> 20:14.165
Yeah.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.122
Oh, my God,
I have a lot of work to do.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.442
Let's do this.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.969
Okay, Amber...

20:41.120 --> 20:42.884
let's see what you got.

20:44.840 --> 20:48.242
Titty-- F-word.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.160
"Motorboating."

20:51.640 --> 20:54.325
Uncle Andy has a boat.
That should be easy.

20:58.680 --> 21:03.527
"Teabagging." Must be British.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.044
"Shocker: One who shocks."

21:11.200 --> 21:12.565
Hmm.

21:13.040 --> 21:17.807
Maybe it's some kind of surprise.
"Hand job, blowjob, rim job."

21:18.000 --> 21:21.607
Why so many jobs?
What's a rim job anyway?

21:22.400 --> 21:25.529
Come on, rim job. Not listed.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.041
Guess I will have to ask
the librarian on that one.

21:34.280 --> 21:41.448
And finally, sexual intercourse
with Rusty Waters.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.565
Well, let's get to work, vagina.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.891
Here you go.
Have a good day. Bye-bye.

21:59.080 --> 22:02.209
Hello. Welcome to Big Bun.
May I help you?

22:02.360 --> 22:05.364
I decided to lose my virginity
to Rusty Waters.

22:06.560 --> 22:09.404
You want fries with that?
No.

22:10.440 --> 22:13.887
"Finger-banged, sixty-nine"?
"Titty fuck, blowjob."

22:14.040 --> 22:17.886
I had no idea that you could be so--
Sophisticated?

22:18.040 --> 22:22.728
Slutty. There are things on this list
that I haven't even done, Brandy.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.524
This is awesome.

22:24.680 --> 22:27.126
So you're gonna scam on other guys
and then hook up with Rusty?

22:27.320 --> 22:28.970
Mm-hm.
No offense, but how?

22:29.160 --> 22:31.128
You said yourself
he's out of your league.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.203
I never said that.
I did.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.761
Okay, yes, he's out of my league now

22:35.920 --> 22:39.447
but not once I learn
how to pearl-necklace him.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.687
Huh. Actually sounds really elegant.
It's not.

22:45.920 --> 22:52.280
Anywho, I'm witty, engaging,
smart, well-read.

22:52.440 --> 22:55.603
Once I add "sexually experienced"
to the package, he'll want me.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.967
Plus, you're an untouched virgin.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.566
Yeah. What guy's gonna say no
to a virgin, right?

23:00.720 --> 23:03.200
Thank you.
That's just the encouragement I need.

23:05.600 --> 23:11.403
<i>Let us swim! Let us swim!
Let us swim! Let us swim!</i>

23:11.560 --> 23:17.488
<i>Let us swim! Let us swim!
Let us swim! Let us swim!</i>

23:19.720 --> 23:22.929
- Cameron. Cameron.
- Whoa!

23:24.960 --> 23:27.406
What was that about?
Pool rats.

23:27.560 --> 23:29.927
Get here at dawn,
don't leave till September.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.130
We're cheap daycare
for the neighborhood rats.

23:34.320 --> 23:39.611
I'm sure it's not that bad.
Just you wait, newbie.

23:39.760 --> 23:43.845
<i>Let us swim! Let us swim! Let us swim!</i>

23:44.000 --> 23:47.482
<i>Let us swim! Let us swim! Let us swim!</i>

24:21.040 --> 24:23.611
Hey. guys, get Off the-- Aah!

24:26.560 --> 24:28.961
See you later, sucker.
Loser

24:32.080 --> 24:34.811
Tried to warn you, newbie.
Aah!

24:36.600 --> 24:41.083
What the truck, Willy?
Welcome to the Thunderdome, bitch.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.085
Settle down and give her a chance
to catch her breath.

24:46.240 --> 24:49.687
Hey, come here. You all right?

24:50.400 --> 24:52.243
Come on.

24:58.400 --> 25:02.405
Now you okay?
I am now.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.761
Good.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.087
Just a little hazing, newbie.
You're good.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.481
Can't believe
you didn't see that coming.

25:12.640 --> 25:16.440
Hey, guys,
put those noodles down. Hey.

25:16.720 --> 25:19.405
Ha-ha-ha. Who did that,
the bubbles in the whistle?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.927
I haven't seen that in years.
That's funny.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.125
on“!

25:26.280 --> 25:30.251
Mayonnaise? In my sunscreen bottle?
Come on, guys, I'm not that pale.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.930
You are a true doofus.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.929
She's so stupid.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.443
<i>Poop! Poop! Poop!
Poop! Poop! Poop!</i>

25:38.640 --> 25:40.642
Newbie, poo patrol.

25:41.720 --> 25:47.682
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.
How very Caddyshack of you.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.645
What did she mean by Caddyshack?
Don't know.

25:52.800 --> 25:55.121
It's not poop. It's not poop.
I'm getting hazed.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.288
You know what that means?

25:57.440 --> 25:59.488
What is it, you guys, Baby Ruth?

26:00.160 --> 26:03.960
Snickers? It's very convincing, Willy.
I'm impressed.

26:04.160 --> 26:08.245
Oh, no. She's not gonna--
Dude, she's gonna.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.481
Oh...

26:22.440 --> 26:23.441
Get out of my way!

26:25.520 --> 26:28.171
Oh, my God.
I've never seen that before.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.290
That's not even on <i>Faces</i> of Death
or any of that shit.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.324
I fucking like this girl.
That was awesome, newbie.

26:46.680 --> 26:49.490
Both the boys and girls
locker rooms are clean, okay?

26:49.640 --> 26:51.529
It's not really fair
you made me do both.

26:51.680 --> 26:54.809
Yeah, well, life's not fair, newbie.
You got that right.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.605
No!

26:58.600 --> 27:01.206
Brandy, help--
Not falling for it.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.851
You really don't know how to swim?
I hate the water.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.890
What's wrong with you?
Don't tell anybody. I'll lose my job.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.731
You should lose your job.
That is so irresponsible.

27:28.880 --> 27:32.168
I'm gonna call the Parks Department.
Oh, no, no, no. Hey, hey.

27:32.320 --> 27:35.403
Brandy? Let's not tell anybody.
Let's pretend it didn't happen.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.850
You want me to lie?
My dad is a judge.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.846
Shit, shit, shit. Look, I'll learn, okay?
I'll learn how to swim.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.002
You know what?
Hey, you can teach me.

27:45.160 --> 27:48.050
Seems like something you'd be into.
You're bossy and stuff.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.363
You like to order people around.
Come on, okay? Please?

27:51.600 --> 27:53.443
I can't lose my job, please.

27:56.760 --> 28:00.287
Fine, but I charge $6.25 an hour, cash.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.647
Shit.
And no more hazing.

28:02.800 --> 28:07.089
Okay, no more hazing, $6.25 an hour.
Hey, Brandy. Hey, deal.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.285
Deal. Whoo!

28:10.440 --> 28:13.842
Okay, that's it, that's it. That's it.
Hey, come on.

28:14.040 --> 28:17.089
Hey. You're still gonna teach me
how to swim, right?

28:17.240 --> 28:21.040
Brand? Where's your towel?
I need to dry off.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.725
Okay, Pancake,
you made that list like a week ago.

28:29.880 --> 28:32.690
When are you gonna grow a pair
and do something on it?

28:32.840 --> 28:35.207
Lay off, Fiona.
Some people are just slow learners.

28:35.400 --> 28:39.564
I'm not a slow learner. I got a five
on my advanced-placement tests.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.324
Oh, right.

28:41.480 --> 28:45.326
And it just so happens,
I plan on getting...

28:45.720 --> 28:47.882
finger-banged tonight.

28:48.080 --> 28:51.766
I think it's finger-blasted.
No, it's finger-bombed, bitches.

28:51.920 --> 28:56.642
Okay, well, whatever it is,
I'm going to do it tonight.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.084
All right.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.960
Just how exactly
do you know when to do it?

29:03.120 --> 29:05.726
You'll be like wet and stuff.
You'll be wet and stuff.

29:05.880 --> 29:08.326
Make sure to tell the guy
how wet you are. They love that.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.448
The guy's gonna be doing
most of the work.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.642
Yeah, but most guys suck at it.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.689
When Ross Peterson
tried to finger me,

29:14.840 --> 29:16.683
it was like he was digging
for loose change.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.002
Like dimes between couch cushions.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.688
Sounds terrible.

29:24.800 --> 29:27.451
Ohh. What's up, my bitches?

29:28.640 --> 29:30.324
What happened to your fingers?

29:30.480 --> 29:34.451
Burnt the shit out of them lighting off
some cherry bombs. It's gnarly, right?

29:35.840 --> 29:38.286
Hey. Get in here.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.365
Get it together, Klark.

29:41.520 --> 29:45.241
Women get fingered every day.
It's not that big of a deal.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.528
Come on.

30:03.640 --> 30:06.120
What? You want some?

30:06.320 --> 30:07.731
Yeah, I want some.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.891
Oh! I'm such a goof.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.960
All over my shirt.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.081
Sorry.

30:30.080 --> 30:33.402
Did you just double wash?
Yeah.

30:41.400 --> 30:44.927
Ow. Wait, wait, wait.
What? What?

30:45.600 --> 30:48.285
Oh, my God, do I have beer breath?
No.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.010
Just let me kiss you back.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.925
Right.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.767
Yeah, I knew that.

30:57.600 --> 30:58.840
Sorry.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.489
I'm winning.

31:23.640 --> 31:26.405
Do you think I should try
and scam with Duffy?

31:26.560 --> 31:28.369
No. Stop.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.610
It's just the wine coolers talking,
man. You can't hold your liquor.

31:33.120 --> 31:35.487
But we have so much history.

31:35.640 --> 31:39.281
You guys dated for like a week
in the eighth grade.

31:39.440 --> 31:44.446
I know, but I think
I just never stopped loving him.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.080
- Sega's my shit.
- I like your shirt.

31:47.240 --> 31:51.086
I love hypercolor on you.
So cool.

31:53.640 --> 31:56.849
I'm so wet. Touch me.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.363
I said I'm wet. Finger me already.

32:11.520 --> 32:15.844
I will. Is it shorts or a skirt?

32:17.440 --> 32:19.204
Neither, they're skorts.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.206
Over or under?

32:25.280 --> 32:28.329
Under.
You sure?

32:28.480 --> 32:29.811
Yes.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.687
But I'm definitely not calling it a "blast."

32:40.880 --> 32:44.851
Let's call it a "finger bomb,"
emphasis on the "bomb."

32:45.000 --> 32:46.047
Well, how did it feel?

32:53.040 --> 32:54.883
Kind of like an itch you can't scratch.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.241
Mm-hm.

32:59.840 --> 33:05.370
Oh. Look, "How to find your G spot."
Hey, can I see that? Give it.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.569
Can you watch the pool for a minute?

33:09.160 --> 33:11.367
- Do you guys masturbate?
- No.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.648
What?
That's gross.

33:13.840 --> 33:16.081
Really? You've never
touched yourself down there?

33:16.400 --> 33:20.962
Well, maybe I straddled the couch.
Only when I can't sleep.

33:22.040 --> 33:26.841
It says here that women should "flick
the bean" as much as the guys do.

33:27.760 --> 33:30.047
"Forty percent of women
never climax during sex

33:30.200 --> 33:33.124
because the guy can't find their G spot."
This is a travesty.

33:35.920 --> 33:38.400
Ladies, we must take charge
of our own sexual gratification.

33:38.560 --> 33:42.884
Ow! What the--?
Get away from me. Get away, perv.

33:44.080 --> 33:47.846
He put his finger up my ass.
I have to put "masturbate" on the list now.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.802
I'm not a quitter. I am not a quitter.

34:17.960 --> 34:20.770
Come on, Klark. Come on.

34:24.199 --> 34:26.440
UVA protection.
That's right.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.601
UVP protection.
Yes.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.888
Hypoallergenic.
It better be.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.042
Waterproof.
Oh, God.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.089
Non-greasy formula.
Yes.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.286
Soothing aloe vera.

34:37.719 --> 34:41.406
Yes! Aloe vera!
Yeah! Aloe vera! Yes!

34:47.159 --> 34:49.766
Privacy, please.
Phone call, ass wipe.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.047
Make it quick.
Chip's calling from Vegas.

34:52.199 --> 34:56.683
What, between lap dances?
Ha, ha. Phish is playing a show there.

34:56.840 --> 34:59.810
Were you humping a pillow?
None of your business.

35:00.320 --> 35:02.209
Loser

35:07.200 --> 35:10.807
Please be Rusty. Please be Rusty.
Please be Rusty.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.364
- This is Brandy.
- Hey, Brandy, it's Cameron.

35:14.520 --> 35:17.000
Oh, hi, Cameron.
I can't really talk right now.

35:17.160 --> 35:20.846
My stupid sister is expecting
a phone call from her idiot boyfriend.

35:21.040 --> 35:23.725
Uh-- Fiancé.
Correction, fiancé.

35:23.880 --> 35:26.167
Get off the line, Amber.
Eat me.

35:26.320 --> 35:30.530
<i>Hurry up, Cameron.
I was wondering if Brandy wanted to--</i>

35:30.680 --> 35:34.480
<i>I mean, if you, Brandy,</i>
<i>wanted to go out on</i> a <i>date.</i>

35:39.680 --> 35:41.569
- Sure. Why not?
- Why not?

35:41.720 --> 35:44.200
What kind of shit answer is that?
Be quiet, Amber.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.328
Don't you have a dick to suck
or something?

35:46.480 --> 35:50.166
Several. Unlike you, fucktard.
Cluck you, Amber.

35:50.320 --> 35:53.244
Cluck? Say "fuck," you loser.
Get-- No!

35:53.400 --> 35:55.209
- Don't touch me.
- Let go!

35:55.360 --> 35:57.089
Mom!

35:58.680 --> 35:59.966
Shut up--!

36:05.920 --> 36:08.048
Dude, what did she say?

36:10.920 --> 36:14.129
Wait. Why we doing the dance?
Why we doing the dance?

36:14.280 --> 36:16.362
What happened?
The Cam-Cam dancing?

36:16.520 --> 36:19.126
She said yes.
Well, technically, she said "why not."

36:19.320 --> 36:23.291
But you know what, I asked her out on a
date, she said yes and it's a "date" date.

36:23.440 --> 36:26.728
It's a motherfucking "date" date.
You're doing the "date-date" date!

36:27.160 --> 36:28.685
- Gonna get his dick all wet.
- Ow!

36:28.840 --> 36:31.366
What am I gonna wear?
Not that.

36:31.520 --> 36:35.206
Why? It's just Cameron.
It doesn't matter, Pancake, who it is.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.601
You can't keep dressing
like Tracey Gold.

36:39.040 --> 36:41.168
Do you wanna borrow my new vest?
Maybe.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.561
No. No. Look.

36:44.320 --> 36:47.722
I rummaged, ah,

36:47.880 --> 36:49.928
through my aunt's closet,

36:50.120 --> 36:53.169
and she's a divorcee,
so she's really lonely.

36:53.320 --> 36:56.608
But she dresses like she's 20,
even though she's 30.

36:56.760 --> 36:58.888
Ugh.
Look, right?

36:59.040 --> 37:03.807
Wow. I like that.
Mm-hm. Feel it. It's like half-silk.

37:03.960 --> 37:07.806
So, what are you guys gonna do?
Oh. I was thinking dry hump.

37:07.960 --> 37:10.201
Whoa. Ha, ha.
Oh, God, no.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.408
She meant, where you guys gonna go?

37:12.560 --> 37:14.961
Oh, we're going to the movies.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.605
Forget dry hump.

37:16.760 --> 37:19.923
Hand job.
All the way.

37:20.640 --> 37:23.325
<i>Hold on till I absorb some heat.</i>

37:23.480 --> 37:26.529
<i>Some added tang
might please you too.</i>

37:26.720 --> 37:29.769
<i>I'll slide into an oven-fresh bun</i>

37:29.920 --> 37:33.003
<i>and I'm ready for your eating fun.</i>

37:33.160 --> 37:36.562
<i>Why don't you try
a juicy-good hot dog?</i>

37:36.720 --> 37:38.882
<i>Mm. Delicious.</i>

37:46.840 --> 37:49.366
What are you doing?
What do you think?

37:50.200 --> 37:51.884
<i>Smoking is not
permitted in this auditorium.</i>

37:52.080 --> 37:56.847
Oh. Ooh. Aah.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.804
Shh!
My bad.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.888
How am I doing?
You're doing really good.

38:03.040 --> 38:06.203
I thought so.
I felt some pre-cum.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.330
I was worried I was gonna
have to spit on my hand

38:09.480 --> 38:12.086
but you seem to be progressing
quite nicely.

38:12.800 --> 38:17.806
<i>No gum-chewing.
No necking and no talking.</i>

38:17.960 --> 38:20.566
Why'd you stop? What?

38:25.120 --> 38:26.167
Excuse me.

38:43.360 --> 38:45.931
Chip, you're in deep shit.
It's been two weeks.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.970
Is Mom home? It's a medical emergency.
No. Bye.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.361
Wait.
What?

38:50.520 --> 38:53.683
I need your expertise.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.090
I'm listening.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.000
Okay.

38:59.200 --> 39:03.250
So I'm giving a guy a hand job--
Now? Gross. Get off the phone.

39:03.440 --> 39:05.761
No, not "now" now.
He's in the theater.

39:05.920 --> 39:08.082
You left him?
You're gonna give him blue balls.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.203
You'll make him sterile. Finish him off.

39:10.360 --> 39:13.364
Ship. But I don't know how.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.842
There's a weird extra skin.
Doesn't look like it did in health class.

39:17.040 --> 39:20.601
What? He's not circumcised?
What are his parents, like hippies?

39:20.760 --> 39:24.003
I don't know. Will you just help me?
All right. Calm down.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.811
This is what you do
with the pig in the blanket.

39:36.440 --> 39:37.646
Everything okay?

39:37.800 --> 39:39.370
Did I do something wrong?
No.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.050
Are you sure?

39:48.760 --> 39:51.491
Is that butter? Oh!
Uh-huh.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.809
Do something.

39:59.840 --> 40:03.003
Do you want me to touch you?
No.

40:04.760 --> 40:08.003
Oh. Oh.

40:08.360 --> 40:12.001
I paid $5 for this. Okay?
They're ruining it.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.682
- I love you!
- Aah!

40:21.840 --> 40:25.083
Shh!
Sorry.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.523
Oh, my God.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.291
My, oh, my.

40:36.320 --> 40:37.765
Make sure you get more SnackWells.

40:37.920 --> 40:40.082
I got it, honey. Number one on the list.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.129
- Good morning.
- Hi, honey.

40:42.280 --> 40:46.285
Amber. Mother.
Why are some men not circumcised?

40:46.440 --> 40:48.363
Oh, come on. It's 9 a.m.

40:48.520 --> 40:51.683
I think the better question is,
why are men circumcised at all?

40:52.200 --> 40:57.525
Now see, most boys become circumcised
at birth, right when they're newborn.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.848
Some parents do it
for religious reasons,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.970
others do it because they feel
it's more hygienic.

41:03.120 --> 41:08.411
But the uncircumcised penis, see that?
See that turtle neck there?

41:08.560 --> 41:10.688
Mom. I'm eating.
You should see this too.

41:10.840 --> 41:13.411
You're getting married. That cow neck--

41:13.560 --> 41:18.566
There?
Mm-hm. That is very, very sensitive.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.449
And now if you remove that,

41:20.600 --> 41:23.649
then you're actually reducing
a man's sexual pleasure.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.250
That's terrible.
Isn't that awful?

41:26.400 --> 41:28.402
Does it hurt?
That's a good question.

41:28.560 --> 41:31.484
What's a good question?
Did it hurt when you got circumcised?

41:31.640 --> 41:34.007
I'm late for work.
No coffee?

41:34.320 --> 41:35.367
Bye, Daddy.

41:39.040 --> 41:41.407
Hey, let me get that for you.

41:42.240 --> 41:43.765
Thanks.

41:45.200 --> 41:48.044
It's the least I can do. Watch your step.
You look fantastic.

41:48.200 --> 41:51.841
Miss Chardine. You little minx.
Come here, you. Let me take that.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.923
- Thanks.
- Someone's using her Ab Roller.

41:54.080 --> 41:57.209
Let me tell you something, ladies.
Men have a one-track mind.

41:57.360 --> 42:00.011
Flash a little skin
and they're like putty in your...

42:00.200 --> 42:02.601
Like you're a car. I'm
gonna fill you up with oil

42:02.760 --> 42:04.524
or put it all over your body.

42:04.680 --> 42:05.761
No, Willy, I got this.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.443
This Will do.

42:25.120 --> 42:27.088
New suit?
What, this old thing?

42:33.080 --> 42:34.445
No cuts.

43:03.960 --> 43:07.123
Ready to rotate?
Sure.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.521
Might wanna put your top
back on first, though.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.764
Oh, my God.

43:15.520 --> 43:19.525
Well, if it isn't the president
of the Itty Bitty Titty Committee.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.921
Itty Bitty Titty Committee.

43:24.200 --> 43:26.202
You guys, give it back.

43:26.360 --> 43:28.727
I'm the president
of the Itty Bitty Titty Committee.

43:28.880 --> 43:32.043
- You guys, give it back now.
- You look like a little boy.

43:32.520 --> 43:36.047
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, my God.
I have bigger boobs than you.

43:38.960 --> 43:41.440
Bet you didn't see that one coming.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.449
Women in Europe go topless
all the time. So deal with it.

43:48.640 --> 43:51.371
But they have boobs.
Big deal.

43:54.840 --> 43:58.287
What, Jenna, your kids
never seen tits before? What?

43:58.440 --> 44:02.923
That chick is crazy.
Yeah, I know what you mean.

44:03.080 --> 44:05.128
I like it.

44:06.520 --> 44:08.204
What do you mean, you like it?

44:08.360 --> 44:10.522
Dad, guess what.

44:20.080 --> 44:23.243
Good, that's it. There you go.

44:23.400 --> 44:25.050
Just blow little bubbles.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.367
Little itty bitty bubbles?
Ha-ha-ha.

44:28.560 --> 44:30.927
Fine.
I can't swim. You're killing me.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.527
I can't swim.
You're in four feet of water.

44:33.680 --> 44:35.728
God, you're such a jerk.

44:39.760 --> 44:41.603
You're right, I'm a jerk.

44:44.080 --> 44:46.003
You still have no tits.

44:48.240 --> 44:49.765
Relax.
Okay.

44:49.920 --> 44:52.207
If you keep tensing up,
you're gonna sink.

44:52.960 --> 44:53.961
Hey, look at that.

44:54.120 --> 44:55.645
RAUGHS]

44:55.800 --> 44:59.691
Hey. Hey, I'm floating. Whoo.

45:00.440 --> 45:02.283
Whoo!

45:07.240 --> 45:09.004
It's weird, huh?
Yeah.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.162
It's like the minute
you give up control,

45:11.320 --> 45:14.130
you just know what to do
without doing anything.

45:16.120 --> 45:17.804
Thought about
taking your own advice?

45:17.960 --> 45:19.371
What's that supposed to mean?

45:19.520 --> 45:22.000
Well, don't take this the wrong way,
but, you know,

45:22.160 --> 45:25.243
sometimes you can be super bossy

45:25.400 --> 45:28.882
and totally annoying
and, you know, kind of a bitch.

45:30.280 --> 45:33.011
You should take it down a notch. Or 12.

45:36.200 --> 45:37.929
I'm sorry.

45:38.840 --> 45:41.844
I don't mean to come off that way.
See, that was really good.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.847
It's, like, you were sad and I started
to feel bad for you. Are you crying?

45:47.000 --> 45:50.322
No. God, you just called me a bitch.

45:50.720 --> 45:52.848
See, now you're starting
to bum me out again.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.527
Yo, butt munch.
You want that ride or not? Let's go.

45:56.680 --> 45:59.001
Coming, Amber.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.527
Willy, this is Amber, my sister.
Amber, Willy, my boss.

46:03.680 --> 46:07.526
Hey. Amber Klark. No way.

46:08.320 --> 46:11.164
I was a senior
when you were a freshman.

46:11.320 --> 46:13.209
Oh. I thought you were the custodian.

46:14.520 --> 46:17.490
Everybody thought I was the custodian.
So you guys are sisters?

46:17.640 --> 46:19.165
You two are nothing alike.

46:19.320 --> 46:21.209
Thank you.
Thank you.

46:21.360 --> 46:23.681
I'm gonna get my stuff.
Hurry up, fucktard.

46:23.880 --> 46:26.360
I don't wanna miss Home Improvement.
Shut up, Amber.

46:26.520 --> 46:30.081
You shut up.
Ha, ha. Home Improvement. Hey.

46:30.880 --> 46:33.360
Howdy, neighbor.
I'm not your neighbor.

46:33.560 --> 46:36.211
I was doing Wilson,
the neighbor in Home Improvement.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.604
Whatever.
Could you give me a towel?

46:39.760 --> 46:40.841
No.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.322
I've been wanting to have this
conversation with you for a long time

46:44.480 --> 46:47.484
but I wasn't sure if you were
mature enough to handle it.

46:48.080 --> 46:52.130
I lost my virginity when I was 17

46:52.280 --> 46:54.328
with Tucker Brooks.

46:55.480 --> 46:59.929
You mean, I wasn't your first?
No.

47:00.080 --> 47:03.402
Was I your second?
No. We metjunior year in college.

47:03.560 --> 47:05.642
Don't be silly.
So where did--?

47:05.840 --> 47:07.922
Where did you
and Tucker Brooks do it?

47:08.080 --> 47:09.923
In the vagina,
but that's not important.

47:10.080 --> 47:13.323
No, I meant as in a location.
Oh. Oh.

47:13.480 --> 47:15.562
I assume the vagina.
Oh. Oh. Oh.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.767
Beaver Creek.
Like in the back seat of a car?

47:20.080 --> 47:23.607
Mostly.
I never went to Beaver Creek.

47:23.760 --> 47:26.127
You didn't?
No, I told you.

47:26.320 --> 47:29.608
My first time was with you.
But you were so good.

47:29.760 --> 47:32.843
Thanks. I read Penthouse.

47:37.120 --> 47:40.203
Why didn't I think of that? Doy.

47:47.200 --> 47:52.889
Whoa. Look at the afro on this snatch.
It's the biggest thing I've ever seen.

47:53.320 --> 47:56.449
Did they not have Nair in the '70s?
Why are their boobs so small?

47:56.640 --> 47:58.802
Because they're real?
Weird.

48:00.320 --> 48:03.130
It's the worst feeling.
It's like a tiny boxer is, like,

48:03.680 --> 48:08.402
boom, one nut, two nut, three--
Just pounding away at your nuts.

48:08.560 --> 48:09.971
What do you think
they're talking about?

48:12.120 --> 48:15.044
I don't know. Stupid stuff.
Probably about their periods.

48:15.240 --> 48:17.971
How much they like chocolate.
Anyway, blue balls is real.

48:18.160 --> 48:20.162
Somebody should do something.
Mm.

48:20.680 --> 48:23.331
You guys, Rusty just looked at me,
Huh?

48:24.120 --> 48:26.327
And then whispered
something to Derrick.

48:26.480 --> 48:28.847
What do you think
they're talking about?

48:30.320 --> 48:31.481
Hey

48:31.640 --> 48:34.007
You wanna keep it?
You want your snorkel back?

48:34.160 --> 48:37.482
Find out what Rusty's talking about.
Find out what they're talking about.

48:37.680 --> 48:40.331
Be secretive, and come back and tell us.
Done.

48:40.520 --> 48:42.841
Pronto.
Fine.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.405
So, Pancake, are you ready
to knock "blowjob" off that list?

48:49.160 --> 48:50.889
I think so.

48:51.040 --> 48:53.441
There's some really
good articles in here.

48:53.600 --> 48:54.681
I'm not reading.

48:54.840 --> 48:58.003
Mm. You should check out page 47.

48:59.360 --> 49:02.682
It says that if a guy
drinks pineapple juice

49:03.640 --> 49:06.610
his semen will taste sweet.
Isn't that weird?

49:07.520 --> 49:10.888
I'm playing a set at the Koffee
Klatch this Saturday. You should come.

49:11.040 --> 49:14.806
I know it's not a big venue
like the Moose or anything, but, uh,

49:14.960 --> 49:16.007
a gig's a gig.

49:16.160 --> 49:19.050
Did you highlight this?
Brandy, you can't swallow.

49:19.200 --> 49:21.806
Why? Do you know how
many calories jizz has?

49:23.320 --> 49:25.368
You must get so much pussy
with that guitar.

49:27.160 --> 49:30.323
Totally.
Why else would I play this thing?

49:32.080 --> 49:34.242
Rusty's playing Cats
at the Moose on Saturday.

49:34.400 --> 49:35.890
<i>Cats?</i>

49:36.840 --> 49:38.365
I love that musical.

49:39.920 --> 49:42.651
If you drink pineapple juice,
she'll give you a blowjob.

49:49.160 --> 49:51.401
You guys want me to get you
some pineapple juice?

49:51.920 --> 49:54.207
Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes, that'd be nice.

49:55.440 --> 49:58.364
- We have to go to that show.
- Hey, Brandy.

49:58.520 --> 49:59.760
Hey, Cameron.

49:59.920 --> 50:02.924
So I would love
to take you out this weekend.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.605
<i>Sleepless in Seattle is playing.</i>

50:04.760 --> 50:07.764
I don't know about you,
but I love anything with Meg Ryan.

50:07.920 --> 50:10.685
Yeah, it sure would suck to miss that.

50:10.840 --> 50:13.320
See you later, Pancake.
Bye,guys.

50:13.480 --> 50:15.608
So I'll pick you up at 8?

50:17.280 --> 50:19.931
Knock, knock. Laundry delivery.

50:20.120 --> 50:21.201
Whatever.

50:23.120 --> 50:25.964
Don't worry, I washed
your Wonderbras on delicate.

50:26.120 --> 50:29.761
I wasn't sure how to fold your G-strings.
There's not much to them, huh?

50:29.960 --> 50:31.291
That's the point.

50:31.440 --> 50:32.965
RAUGHS]

50:33.320 --> 50:34.401
Right.

50:34.560 --> 50:38.565
Mm. Your lotion smells really nice.
What is that, vanilla?

50:38.760 --> 50:41.240
Strawberries and cream.
Mm.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.447
Why are you being nice?

50:42.640 --> 50:45.723
I know how stressed out you are,
planning a wedding and everything.

50:45.880 --> 50:49.680
I just thought I should
help out my big sis.

50:50.720 --> 50:53.564
God, you know what? It is stressful.

50:53.720 --> 50:56.963
You've no idea how hard it is
trying to find a hot wedding dress.

50:57.120 --> 51:00.169
Everything is ankle length.
I know, right?

51:01.800 --> 51:04.963
So, what are your plans
for after this summer?

51:05.160 --> 51:08.403
I'm marrying Chippy.
Duh. I mean for work, Amber.

51:08.560 --> 51:11.086
You didn't go to college
for your MRS degree.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.890
Planning a wedding is a job.

51:13.040 --> 51:15.771
Besides, after we're married,
Chippy will take care of me.

51:15.920 --> 51:19.561
Amber, a woman needs a man
like a fish needs a bicycle.

51:19.760 --> 51:22.411
You can support yourself.
You don't need a man to do that.

51:24.840 --> 51:30.768
Wow. Those things really work.
And that's why I don't have to.

51:31.560 --> 51:35.007
Mm-hm. Yeah. Like that.

51:43.560 --> 51:46.291
I don't understand
why this band is still playing.

51:46.440 --> 51:49.125
Rusty should be up.

51:49.280 --> 51:51.009
I'm gonna find out what's going on.

51:51.160 --> 51:52.400
- Okay.
- Cool.

51:58.360 --> 51:59.407
Excuse me.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.729
Excuse me. Hi.

52:04.880 --> 52:07.645
I know you're singing,
but I don't know who else to ask.

52:07.800 --> 52:11.043
Do you know if Rusty Waters'
Acoustic Experience is on next?

52:12.800 --> 52:15.485
Just nod your head yes.
Are they on after you?

52:18.560 --> 52:20.403
Was that a yes?
Get up here.

52:30.240 --> 52:34.723
Oh, my God, Fiona.
Oh, my God. Look over there.

52:38.400 --> 52:40.641
No fucking way!

52:44.200 --> 52:46.328
Oh, my God. Who are you?

52:46.960 --> 52:48.007
Hi.

53:10.040 --> 53:13.249
Thanks, Boise. Clinton sucks.
Perot in '96.

53:13.400 --> 53:16.290
Free Tibet, if you're not too busy.

53:16.440 --> 53:21.401
And also thank you for the opportunity
for having me dance.

53:26.440 --> 53:28.761
Good evening, Miss Klark. Judge.
Hi.

53:28.920 --> 53:31.002
Who are you?
George, this is Cameron,

53:31.160 --> 53:33.003
Brandy's study buddy.

53:33.320 --> 53:35.084
Hi.
So is Brandy ready?

53:35.680 --> 53:39.730
Oh. I'm sorry,
I think there might be some mistake.

53:39.880 --> 53:43.930
Classic. Nerd got stood up.
I guess nice guys do come in last.

53:44.080 --> 53:45.730
Aww. Heh, heh.

53:45.880 --> 53:48.645
You can say that again.
George, will you give it a rest?

53:48.800 --> 53:50.484
That was 20 years ago.

53:52.480 --> 53:56.530
So she's not here?
Oh, jeez, Kirk, come on in.

53:56.680 --> 53:58.091
Cameron.
It's Cameron.

53:58.240 --> 54:00.004
Who's Cameron?

54:01.480 --> 54:05.724
I'm sure Brandy will be back soon.
Just make yourself at home.

54:41.120 --> 54:43.566
"French kiss, make out,

54:43.720 --> 54:46.929
finger bomb, no skorts,

54:47.680 --> 54:49.364
hand job Cameron."

54:54.760 --> 54:56.728
What the hell?

54:59.560 --> 55:03.360
Drink up, boys, and follow me.
Whoo-hoo!

55:18.720 --> 55:21.041
Why'd they buy us
pineapple juice?

55:21.200 --> 55:23.089
I think they're Mormons, bro.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.523
Look at me, guys.

55:29.920 --> 55:31.251
You might be right.

55:33.160 --> 55:35.970
Bass has four strings,
guitar has six.

55:36.120 --> 55:39.727
The bass covers the lower end of the--
Okay, shut up.

55:55.400 --> 55:59.769
I'm sorry. I just feel so bad for him.

56:15.640 --> 56:17.642
So wet in here.

56:19.280 --> 56:21.248
Are you gonna come in?

56:21.440 --> 56:27.004
Can't. Dyed my hair this morning.
Can't get it wet for 48 hours.

56:30.640 --> 56:32.642
Well, that's a shame

56:33.440 --> 56:38.048
because a hot shower
sounds really nice right about now.

56:39.040 --> 56:40.804
If you ask me.

56:43.480 --> 56:47.166
Uh, señorita,
you are so amorous.

56:47.320 --> 56:51.644
Your energy is just electric,
you know? Heh.

56:51.840 --> 56:55.561
Life on the road
is so treacherous, you know?

56:55.760 --> 56:58.286
Never would've thought
touring the Pacific Northwest

56:58.440 --> 57:00.090
would be so harrowing--

57:00.240 --> 57:02.402
Are you gonna talk
the whole time I blow you?

57:02.600 --> 57:07.003
I'm trying to figure this out. I think I
have to breathe through my nose. Shh!

57:07.360 --> 57:09.328
Apologies.
Thank you.

57:09.480 --> 57:13.849
I'm a musical wordsmith, honey.
Lamenting is what I do.

57:14.040 --> 57:16.850
And telling the troubadour's tale
is what I do best--

57:33.080 --> 57:34.206
Showers.

57:45.720 --> 57:46.846
What the fuck?

57:48.520 --> 57:51.046
Brandy. Who's this guy?

57:53.080 --> 57:55.242
Brandy, answer me.
What are you doing here?

57:56.320 --> 58:00.723
Mm.
Open your mouth and answer me.

58:04.480 --> 58:06.562
Did it taste like pineapple juice?

58:06.720 --> 58:10.645
Shut up. Just shut up. I--
You two just stay apart.

58:10.840 --> 58:12.922
You guys over there,
you guys over here.

58:13.080 --> 58:16.562
Dude, these are like little girls, all right?
What were you thinking?

58:16.760 --> 58:21.766
Brandy, you're being totally,
totally irresponsible, okay?

58:28.840 --> 58:30.171
Wow.

58:30.360 --> 58:33.603
That's some good shit, man.
Her dad is a judge,

58:33.760 --> 58:35.444
dude.
What?

58:35.600 --> 58:37.602
This one, her dad's a judge.

58:37.760 --> 58:41.845
A judge?
Who do you think you are, Lolita?

58:42.400 --> 58:47.201
I mean, you lured me in,
you sought me out

58:47.360 --> 58:50.364
and then you lie to me?
What's that about?

58:51.160 --> 58:53.367
Oh, that's good.

58:54.600 --> 58:56.728
I think I just wrote a song.
Whoa.

58:56.880 --> 58:58.769
To the van.
All right.

59:00.560 --> 59:04.121
That was cool.
Bye. Love your music.

59:04.800 --> 59:07.121
There's a gate right there.
I don't know why you--

59:07.280 --> 59:08.964
All right.

59:09.640 --> 59:13.122
Hey, hey, hey. Girls, I'm not done.
These guys are 10 years older than you.

59:13.320 --> 59:15.641
What are you doing?
Oh, my God.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.810
Willy, do you live here?
Are you homeless?

59:18.960 --> 59:23.602
Yes, I'm a homeless American. Stop it.
I shouldn't be seeing you guys like this.

59:23.760 --> 59:26.809
Brandy, what are you thinking?

59:27.000 --> 59:29.241
What would've happened tonight
if I wasn't here?

59:29.400 --> 59:32.006
Um... I think I would've swallowed.

59:33.480 --> 59:37.007
I'm serious.
I just got that, and that's not funny.

59:37.200 --> 59:40.010
- It's not funny at all, okay?
- Come on, Willy.

59:40.200 --> 59:42.646
Let's see how funny it is
when I call your folks.

59:42.800 --> 59:44.484
- No.
- Okay? Hey. hey.

59:44.680 --> 59:48.401
You guys should be at home in bed,
in flannel pajamas,

59:48.600 --> 59:51.331
not floundering around
in your underwear--

59:51.520 --> 59:53.682
I don't know your number.
I don't know who I called.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.208
- What a night.
- You can say that again.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.770
What are you doing here?
We had a date.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:16.082
Or were you so busy with your stupid
scam list that you forgot all about it?

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.201
Cameron, that's private.
Give that back to me.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.282
Cameron. That's private.
Give it back.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:28.048
You cheat on me?
No. Cheat? We're not even together.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.806
We're not together because
I'm breaking up with you.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.406
You can't break up with me,
we were never going out.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:38.168
Brandy, you gave me a hand job.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.681
No, it's a hand job.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.409
I told you that I love you.
You meant that?

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.610
Brandy, how could you do this to me?

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.560
I work with you, I study with you,
I fingered you.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:02.327
At any point you could've told me
that you were just using me.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.768
I wonder if I'll ever be able
to enjoy a hand job again.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.367
Cameron, don't say that.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.605
I'm probably gonna have
erectile dysfunction.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.808
Camster.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.726
It was just a misunderstanding.
Don't touch me.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.889
I hope you get AIDS.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.083
Cameron!

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.771
Welcome to Big Bun.
Can I take your order?

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.084
Cameron wants me to die of AIDS.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.448
<i>And can I get a milkshake?</i>

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.525
Come on, we're waiting here.
Shit. All right, man.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.247
I cannot believe he is letting a hand job
come between our friendship.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.482
He should be happy
that you jerked him off.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.041
Especially with his condition.
Yeah.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.249
I didn't know he "like" liked me.
How am I supposed to know?

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.488
I'm not a mind reader.
I'm not a gypsy.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.122
Do you, like, "like" like him back?
I don't know.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.331
It's Cameron.
I don't think about him like that.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.322
But, you guys, he was...

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.169
crying.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.002
I think I really hurt him.
Dude, he's just being a little baby.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.731
Guys mess around
and girls just have to put up with it?

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.490
Yeah.
It's bullshit.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.483
When I sprained my ankle
in gym class,

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:28.086
Duffy square danced
with, like, three other girls.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.083
- He did not.
- I had to sit and watch.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.006
Oh, my God. You broke up
three years ago. Get over it.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.162
It still hurts, Fiona.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.649
It's like Gloria Steinem says,
"You're either the virgin or the whore."

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.847
Well, you know what?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.322
One of those sounds
a lot funner than the other one.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.369
Yeah. The whore.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:50.205
Maybe this whole scam-list thing
was a stupid idea.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.762
No, you can't give up now.
You worked too hard to get to this point.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.810
You can't back out now.
Think about all you've accomplished.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.002
You've gotten more action
this last month

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.970
than your entire high school career.
That's true.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.044
You're right.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.880
I deserve to get fucked by Rusty.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.883
She made a scam list?

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:17.041
A list of sexual experiments
to do with guys.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.205
She used me, man.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.490
Like she could just jerk me off
without ever even committing.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.206
That is terrible. Any old guy?
Yup.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.522
Oh, he's such a dick,
he's such a dick.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.728
No, he's not a dick, Duffy.
He is.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.851
No, he's like one of my best friends.
I know. Me too.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.008
You have to believe me,
I didn't mean to hurt him.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.640
I know you didn't.
Why would I do that on purpose?

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:44.929
You would never. You're an angel.
He told me he wanted me to die.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.162
He's a meanie. He's a dick.
He's not a dick.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:50.164
But don't worry,
Duffy's here to make it all better.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.082
Why are you referring to yourself
in the third person?

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:59.602
Oh-- Duffy. Duffy, stop.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.764
What? I just invited you over
to make you feel better.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.170
What's on your neck?

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.927
Nothing. Just a little hickey that

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.402
Kitty Randall gave to me
when we dry humped the other night.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.528
What's dry hump?
Ahem.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:20.447
It's actually kind of complicated.
I'd have to show you.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.610
Okay. You can show me.
You're just gonna let me hump you?

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.801
Yes.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.287
It's all right. It's all right.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.562
My mother's cats. Mother's cats.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.963
I'm sorry.
I'm still hard. Let's keep going. Oh, yeah.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.284
You've never done this before?
No.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.130
Feels so good.
Yes.

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.204
Shut the fuck up.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.401
No way, dude.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.564
We dry humped last night
all over my room.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:57.327
She's writing a sex manual or something.
Sex manual?

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.524
All right.
Uh-huh.

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.491
Thank you.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.722
Uh, hey,
you got plans tonight?

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.922
Um...

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:16.688
I don't know, Derrick.
Do we have plans tonight?

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.321
Uh...

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.804
Sure.
Ha-ha-ha.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.767
You're so funny. Ha-ha-ha.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.601
Walk me to my bike.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.842
I did not say anything.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.801
Hey, where you going?
I need some air.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.962
But it's an outdoor pool.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.449
I need air.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.689
Welcome to Big Bun.
May I help you?

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.087
Double order of fish sticks,
a large RC Cola

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.971
and would either of you
like to go out on a date?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.368
I will.
Whoa. Sisters before misters.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:06.047
Oh. What? Come on, give me a break.
Brandy doesn't own Cameron, okay?

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.409
And she said herself
that she doesn't, like, "like" like him.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.170
So it's an open playing field.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:14.440
I've never been with someone
who wasn't circumcised,

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.046
and I wanna see if it's as gross
as she says.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:18.890
I can hear you.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.647
Hello? Hello?

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:32.171
Fiona, I can see you right now.
ls every woman in this world--? Aah!

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.411
You know what? Forget it. Forget it.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.563
Stupid car won't work.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.001
Let me get this straight,

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.481
you wanna go down on me?

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:54.886
Yeah, because I just got dumped
because I suck dick at eating pussy.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.281
I just thought that if I practice,

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.125
then I could keep it
from happening again.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.760
It's a lot harder than you think.
I don't know.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.729
You know what? Forget this.
Forget it. it's--

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.291
Shh.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.405
You had me at "eating pussy."

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.888
You had me at "eating pussy."

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.088
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.084
Right. Okay.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.281
Up a smidge.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.722
Okay, down a tad.

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.121
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, right there.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.487
It's not working.
Yeah, it's working.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.411
No, it's not.
Yeah, it's really working.

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:36.882
No, it's not. My video
won't play, Derrick.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.811
Was that good?

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.166
Oh. Ow. Mm.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.800
Is the TV on channel three?
Yes.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.442
Well, make sure it's set to VCR, man.
Okay.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.324
- What you doing?
- Looking for my keys.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.847
You need some help?
I mean, I can always help.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.480
No.
I know, buddy, I know. Just get out.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.244
All right, GUYS-

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.450
I thought we were alone.
Who, Benji?

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.970
He doesn't count.
He believes in monsters and shit.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.771
He's not a person.
Okay, fine.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.529
<i>Mitchell</i> residence.
Hello, Mr. Mitchell, it's Brandy.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.011
Is Cameron there?

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.130
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry, he's in his room
with the door locked,</i>

01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:47.807
<i>and he's listening
to Sarah McLachlan.</i>

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.328
<i>That bad, huh?
Yeah. I would tell him you called</i>

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.569
<i>but we 're not saying
your name around here.</i>

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:57.644
Got it. Thanks anyways.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.566
It's a three-day rental, so we can
watch it again tomorrow if you want.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.808
I'm glad you talked me into this.
Whoo!

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.566
So excited for Beaches.
Me too.

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:10.048
Guys, I brought Kleenex and stuff,
just in case we get emotional.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:14.171
Yes, Wendy, we know.
What's after "titty fucked," cunni-what?

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:15.810
Cunnilingus.
What is that?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.243
It's when a man stimulates
the female genitals with his mouth.

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:21.640
No shit. So Derrick ate you out?

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.765
Yeah. I prefer "cunnilingus," though.
"Eat out" reminds me of fast food.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.729
Wow. Look at you.
That's a step away from sex.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.370
Yeah, I know.
We should celebrate

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.609
by watching Beaches.
So, urn...

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.843
now that you're like hooking up
with all these different guys,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.685
is it cool if I go out
with Cameron?

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.442
What? Cameron asked you out?
He asked me out too,

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.126
but I said no
because you're my best friend,

01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:49.886
and best friends don't let boys
get between them.

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.291
Speaking of that,
it's time for Beaches.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:56.284
- Yeah, Beaches.
- Yeah.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.441
Are you pressing the right button?

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.601
I think so.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.809
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you dry hump Duffy?

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.489
What?
Yeah.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.281
What?
He gave me two hickeys. One and one.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.807
Brandy.
Ow.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.247
You know I, like, "like" like Duffy.
Yeah.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.483
So? It's not like you're going out with him.
So? What is wrong with you?

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.804
Why are you spazzing out?
Because it's ho's before bros, man.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.200
You don't just go around

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.482
hooking up with whoever. Pbbt!
Whomever.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.166
You're going out with Cameron,
so don't be a hypocrite.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:30.164
Yeah, but I asked you first.
That's the difference.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:34.882
I cannot believe that you would
choose a boy over our friendship.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.004
- You don't deserve to watch Beaches.
- No, she doesn't.

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.404
Don't say that.
Let's go. Let's watch it at your place.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.961
You guys. It's stuck, Wendy.

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:48.010
Yeah, thanks, I can see that.
Take it. Let's go.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.242
- Don't take my VCR.
- Come on.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.963
Wait. Come back.
You better hope that tape isn't ruined.

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.168
Fiona, come on, don't be--
No, I'm sorry,

01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:00.006
I don't understand you
because I don't speak slut.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.367
- Willy, what happened?
- Same shit every summer.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.161
Oak Crest Country Club
pulls some stupid prank on us.

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.046
- It's an initiation for their new lifeguards.
- I can't believe they did that.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.521
You were here all night
and you didn't hear them?

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.364
No.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.320
God, man, Oak Crest,
those guys are good.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:28.686
Yeah. Yeah,
that's a big kick in the nuts.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.730
I'll have Rusty and Derrick
put it back up when they get here.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:35.202
What? No, Willy,
we need to get them back.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:42.009
Yeah, we need to get revenge.
I mean, real revenge.

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:45.684
You mean, like--? Like kill them?
What?

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.081
I think that's illegal.
I know a guy with a gun--

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.681
No, I mean like we need to get them
where it hurts.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.291
Come on, you're our boss,
our leader.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:58.007
This is your pool. If not you,
then who?

01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.525
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.411
Let's take a big fucking dump
on Oak Crest.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.244
Let's get those fuckers.

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.244
Hey, Bernadette.
What's the plan?

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.760
We're gonna blow this shit up.
We're gonna burn it to the ground.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.410
Rock.
I see it, boss.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.841
Shh.
It's a fucking ladder,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.047
it's gonna make noise.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.726
GO, go!

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.727
Holy shit. That is a fucking slide.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.291
All right, Cameron.
All right.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.444
Nice.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:41.446
<i>Approaching perimeter.
Cameron, what's your status? Over.</i>

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:45.446
He's not talking to you right now.
Over. Shit, this thing's hot.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.446
You can't let personal issues get in
the way of work. Act professional. Over.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.810
You can't see him, but he's
flipping you off right now. Over.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.446
Whatever. Just get into position.
Over.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:01.043
It's fucking scary in here, man.
What are you looking for?

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.964
Just some sort of knob.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.283
Why do they have all these things
in their pool? What does it do?

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.960
We don't have any of these.
How do you not know this?

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.924
Come on.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.763
Shit, there it is.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.528
<i>All right, we found it. Over.</i>

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.444
On my count, guys. In one,

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.168
Ugh.
two, three.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.846
Oh, yeah. Spin that bitch.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:44.681
That good?
How's that?

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:48.686
<i>Guys, you have to see this. Come on out here.
Even you, Cameron. Over.</i>

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.171
Screw you, Brandy.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.201
Shit, newbie, you are as smart
as you think you are.

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.328
This is gonna be
some serious payback.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.246
What?
Nothing.

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.642
We doing this?
What?

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.725
Come on.
Yeah.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.041
Yeah, let's do this.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.803
I'll just take my clothes off too.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.686
Take your time.

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.286
Why don't you talk to her,
instead of being a grumpy gus?

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.721
I am not a grumpy gus.
Yes, you are.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.723
No, I'm not.
You wanna hear a riddle?

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.406
Why did Eddie Vedder cross the road?
Why?

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:40.643
To get
to the other side. Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.881
Jeremy spoke!

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.206
Who's that supposed to be?

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.885
Who's that? That's Eddie Vedder.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.242
That's not the face Vedder makes.
Have you seen the "Jeremy" video?

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.528
I've seen the "Jeremy" video,
that's not the face he makes.

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:52.570
That is the face he makes. I get why
Brandy wants nothing to do with you.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.326
Fuck you, man. Bitch.

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.164
One, two, three.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:13.162
Oh, not again.
What is this?

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:17.765
This thing is like a life preserver.
Jerk. Give it back.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.561
You want it? Too bad.
I like you better without it.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:24.610
I cannot believe you just did that.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:35.045
Excuse me.
Better ask permission next time.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.761
Next time?

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.885
Fuck you, Oak Crest.
Ha-ha-ha.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.086
Busted.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.490
I'm gonna take a shit
in their fucking pool, man.

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.403
What happened here?

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.765
Um...

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.047
Oh...

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:25.841
You're gonna look me in the eye
and deny all of this, huh?

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.491
That doesn't prove anything.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.530
You wrote your name in this?
Who does that?

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.682
I'm sorry. I'm going to college.

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.320
You're supposed to write your name
on everything in case it gets lost.

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:48.530
Look, your little prank
ruined our filtration system.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:51.445
Not our problem.
Well, it's gonna be your problem

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.683
when I report you
to the Parks Department.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:57.486
Hey, friend? Hey, buddy,
don't do that, okay? Please.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.361
Look, the only way I won't call them

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.127
is if you send
a handwritten apology note,

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.567
you promise
these pranks stop today,

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:09.882
and you fire old double-D here.

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.682
No one's getting fired.
Brandy, you're fired.

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.571
I'm gonna have to go to Office Max
for the other stuff.

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:21.329
Are you kidding me, Willy? I'm your best employee.
I taught you how to swim.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.801
What?
I'm sorry, I can't lose my job.

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.246
This is unbelievable.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:31.044
All summer everyone's been telling
me to loosen up and relax

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:33.771
and not think so much and...

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.724
Well, fuck that.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.244
And fuck you too.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.249
Want a beer?
No.

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:14.611
Oh, come on,
don't look at me like that.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:18.968
Honey, can
I speak with you?

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:25.288
This whole thing has been so painful.
Mm.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.763
Cameron was crying afterwards.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.321
They always do.

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:35.121
You know, boys are just really
more sensitive than they let on.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.442
Your father included.
Hm.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.367
Which reminds me,
don't say anything

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:44.525
but I have planned a pretty sexy
surprise for us for our anniversary.

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.728
Mom, I don't wanna hear
about you and Dad--

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:49.281
Having intercourse? Noted.

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:53.642
Honey, listen,
as you move forward

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:58.411
on your sexual journey,
just promise me one thing.

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:02.607
To have fun?
To use lube.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.447
Doesn't always have to be painful.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.243
I wish my mother had given me lube
when I was your age.

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.685
Where exactly do I--?
In the vagina, sweetie.

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.689
Thanks, Mom.

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.050
I got it.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.847
Boise Pool.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.521
- Rusty Waters, please.
- Brandy?

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.285
Yes. Rusty, please.

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:37.365
Uh, Rusty, it's Brandy.
She wants to talk to you.

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:42.048
Hey, newbie. Heard you got fired.
That sucks.

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:46.525
Yeah, I know. It'll be tough explaining
the employment gap in my resume

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:51.362
but anyway,
would you like to go out with me?

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.485
Uh...

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:58.046
Why not? I'll pick you up after work.

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.089
<i>Cool.
Cool.</i>

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.890
Very cool.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.845
What'd he say?

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.241
Yes.
He did?

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:13.121
Yes! He said yes.
Technically, he said "why not."

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.850
But who cares about semantics.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.562
Because Rusty Waters said yes to me,
Brandy Klark, and we're gonna--

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.802
Brandy, are you trying to do
the Roger Rabbit?

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.571
Yeah.
That's not the Roger Rabbit.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.649
This is the Roger Rabbit.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.404
Maybe the Running Man
would be easier for you.

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:34.641
Shit.

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:40.247
So you're taking Brandy out, huh?
I guess so.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:43.051
Awesome. Good for her.
Still working on that sex manual.

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.769
Yeah-- What? Sex manual?
Oh, you didn't know?

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.251
Dude, check this out.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.449
She's writing some sort of sex
encyclopedia or something like that.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:55.843
It's like she can do whatever
and it's research. It's awesome.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.846
She wants to have, like, a good orgasm,
and, like, it's such a mature quest.

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.280
Did you know about this?
No.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.761
You learn something new
at the pool every day. Ha, ha.

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.411
Wow.

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.242
I look--
Good enough to fuck.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.723
I wasn't gonna put it that way, but...

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.606
Does it hurt the first time?
Not if you chug a beer

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.285
and use the lube Morn gave you.

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:26.371
She gave you the lube, right?
Yes. That was weird.

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.482
But helpful.

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:34.566
Hey, are you okay? I noticed
you stopped eating your SnackWells.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:37.769
Chippy cheated on me. With strippers.

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:42.888
You gonna call off the wedding?
I want to, but he won't call me back.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.401
Word of advice, don't fall in love.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.483
Getting your heart broken
fucking sucks.

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.927
Yes, so I've heard.

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:53.331
Okay.
Hey, have fun popping your cherry.

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.890
I Will.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.328
And I want you to know that...

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.964
I wouldn't be having sex tonight
if it weren't for you.

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.327
Really?
Really.

01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.129
Thanks, Brandy, I really needed that.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:12.569
What's it gonna feel like?
I'll figure it out.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.165
Enjoy your penis.

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.570
Here you go.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.727
You, uh, want another one?

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.770
No, thank you. One is my limit.

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.008
Hey, look, there's, um...

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:03.240
There's something
I really wanna ask you.

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.084
Shoot.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.642
Can I kiss you?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.006
I know you can kiss me,
but may you kiss me?

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.645
Oh.

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.561
What?
Forget it. You can definitely kiss me.

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:22.091
Cool.

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.689
Shit, I'm coming, all right?

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.920
Oh. Hey, uh...? Hey, is Brandy here?
No.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:47.446
Um... I think she might be in some
trouble and I need to talk to her.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.284
Can I wait here? Is that cool?

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.283
You got a dick under that poncho?

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.280
Why?

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.281
Maybe we should get a condom.

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:12.689
Good idea.
Last thing we need's a baby, right?

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:14.649
Or AIDS.

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.331
I need to tell you something.
It's okay.

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:30.165
I know you're a virgin.
I'll be gentle, okay?

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.006
No, not that.
I mean, I am a virgin, but...

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.289
I wanna be on top.

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:40.486
It'll increase my chance
of orgasm by 40 percent.

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:44.131
Those are some good odds.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:59.481
You good?
Yeah.

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:23.442
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:28.726
Oh! Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.767
Did you just--?
Yeah. Didn't you?

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.604
Have an orgasm?
Yeah.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.649
No. That was like less than a minute.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:42.881
Shit.

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.569
You've gotta be kidding me.
Look, I usually last like way longer.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.041
You just really got me,
like, riled up, okay?

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:03.567
Just please take me home now.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:07.481
Look, if you just wait like two minutes,
like, he'll be ready to go again.

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.245
I think I just saw Brandy.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:17.082
Oh, no. I'm certain that's not Brandy. Brandy's
with Cameron and he drives a Ford Festiva.

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.049
Why are you certain
she's with Cameron?

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.440
I gave her the lube and--

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:24.241
You gave her the lube?
You had your talk with her, didn't you?

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.607
Of course I did.
If I waited for you to do it,

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:29.764
she would be 40
before she has her first orgasm.

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.605
This is really decent of you.
It's cool of you to do this.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:36.207
Stop talking to me.
Okay. Sorry.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.721
You're just doing me a real solid,
that's all.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.845
I might look like a rock star, but I'm
really a pretty traditional type of guy.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.480
You know,
like a missionary type of guy.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:49.206
Like a good old-fashioned
me on top, you on bottom.

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:52.443
Not like this crazy-- You're super
aggressive. I mean, come on.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.405
Look, I'm a pretty sensitive
dude, all right?

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.489
I'm a meat-and-potatoes
type of guy.

01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.210
You jerk!

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:02.851
Cameron?
Jerk face. Ow!

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.800
Cameron, calm down.
Please calm down.

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:10.248
No, I will not calm down.
Did you make love with him?

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:14.286
Yeah, dude. We did it.
Put the meat right in the taco.

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:16.283
- Get off me.
- Oh, yeah.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.010
I can't believe I was so stupid.

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:25.891
I get it. It's not having sex
that's a big deal, it's this.

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.089
All these feelings and
emotional crap.

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.164
That's why it's better if you
leave feelings and shit out of it.

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:35.369
Feelings are everything,
Brandy. Ow!

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:39.328
Why don't you wait
until you've done it once, virgin?

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.682
Then you'll see that sex
isn't such a big deal.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.650
- How do you know I haven't had sex?
- Look at you.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.326
Look at you!
Hey, stop it. Stop it.

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:49.369
You're animals.
And you are wrong.

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.522
Yeah, you're wrong.
Feelings matter.

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.684
And having sex
with the right person is a big deal.

01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:00.682
Cameron, come here.
Look, I owe you an apology.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:04.727
People talk about sex all the time
like it's no big deal

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:10.560
but when you haven't done it, when
you're a virgin, it is a big deal.

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:15.961
And I think the list was me
trying not to mess up.

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.807
But I did mess up.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:24.443
I messed up when I hurt you.
And I'm really sorry.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:29.360
Well, I still can't believe
you chose Rusty over me.

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:31.887
Dude, I'm standing right here.
Shut up, Rusty.

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.646
You wanna go, Growing Pains?
You retarded Zack Morris.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.371
Rusty, shut up.
Both of you shut up. Both of you shut up.

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.565
Cameron...

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:44.962
you are super nice and cute

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:48.249
and kind and reliable.

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:51.768
You're the kind of guy a girl
would love to be in a relationship with.

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.400
Will I regret messing that up?
Probably yes.

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:58.770
No. No. I'm a teenager.

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:01.366
Teenagers don't have regrets.

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:03.005
That's for your 30s.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:07.927
And, Rusty, Rusty, Rusty.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.209
You are superhot and ripped,

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:18.361
and you play the guitar
and I can't believe I had sex with you.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.602
Am I gonna regret
losing my virginity to you?

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:23.489
Probably. Most girls do.

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:25.961
No. Definitely not.

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:30.284
You are gonna be an awesome
story to tell my friends.

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.126
All right.

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.008
Speaking of which,

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.731
that is where I should be right now.

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:42.804
With my friends. Not here.

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.880
Carry on, men.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.724
You're animals.

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:02.926
Oh, ship.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.287
Put a vibrator in her stocking,
for God's sakes?

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.647
No, I was saving it
for her birthday.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.490
I'm coming, honey.
Wait.

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:19.445
Just because you have lube,
doesn't mean you have to use it.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:26.000
Wait. Ow, ow. George.
Ow. Wait.

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:29.131
I'm really-- I'm there.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.128
Amber.
Dad!

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:38.121
Dad? Hey. Hey, Mr. Klark.
Hey, I'm Willy.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.011
Judge.
Judge, that's right.

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:42.282
Judge Klark.
You're a fucking judge.

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:47.207
Hey, uh, look, I'm Brandy's boss
at the pool and, uh... Um...

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.966
She's a great girl, by the way.
And so is this one.

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:53.442
You've raised two amazing,
amazing daughters.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.887
I want you off my house
and out of my daughter!

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:59.044
Dad, gross.
You know what I mean.

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.727
Anything else I can do for you, sir?
Right now!

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:10.531
I just did it.
Amber.

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.729
Mom.
That's not Chip.

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:16.009
No shit, Mom.
Get the fuck out of my room!

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:20.051
No, leave it. Just leave it.
Finish up, please.

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.846
<i>I'm the one who won't live to see
my daughter grow into a woman</i>

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.002
<i>who won't be able to protect her
from the world.</i>

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:29.927
<i>And I hate it. I hate that she'd rather
be with you, who has energy, who is fun.</i>

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:31.850
<i>You told me to play with her.</i>

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.685
<i>I know I did, but I didn't know
it was gonna make me feel like this.</i>

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:41.004
Okay, you know what? You can't handle this.
I'm turning it off.

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.730
No, I can handle it.
No, you can't.

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:45.247
Look at you, you're a mess.

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:53.601
What the hell are you doing?

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.604
I don't want her here.

01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.569
She said she doesn't want you.
Get out.

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:09.291
Okay, Jesus, stop.
What's wrong with you?

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.569
You think you can start singing
and we're gonna forgive you?

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.085
It doesn't work like that, okay?

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:21.921
Wendy.

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.448
Fiona.
I don't know the words.

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:55.331
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.251
That was super gay.
Oh, my God.

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:38.802
Don't tell anyone we did this.
I'm serious.

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:42.806
I'm really sorry, you guys.
We know. We know.

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.089
Also, I fucked Rusty Waters.

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:48.686
Well... Look at you.
How was it?

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.205
Yeah.

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.805
It was quick.

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:56.723
Brandy, please tell me
you were not getting pregnant tonight.

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:59.326
Don't worry, she was here.
Don't worry, she used a condom.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:03.007
Can we please talk
in the hallway, Dad?

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.209
It's okay.

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:07.885
<i>- Just lie.
- I'm sorry.</i>

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.610
You're gonna be okay.

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:13.210
Let me just start by saying

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:18.366
if you ever need to talk about
birth control or rubbers or--

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:20.887
Did you at least use the lube
that your mother--?

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:24.761
Dad, I don't wanna talk
about that stuff with you.

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:27.764
Thank goodness.
Because neither do I. Ever.

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:32.327
I just...
I need to know that you're okay.

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.363
Dad, I'm fine.

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.004
Seriously.

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.810
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm afraid that's not gonna be possible.

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:45.250
Because you're my daughter
and I love you.

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:55.407
Now, please go back to playing
with your loose friends.

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.607
Okay, Dad.

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:27.450
Never thought
I'd see you on the guard stand.

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.849
Well, hello.
Hi.

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:40.486
You can't stay away from here.

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:45.931
I heard that you stopped by my house
to save me, so to speak.

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.003
I just wanted to come by
and thank you.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:52.449
Yeah, I tried to do the right thing, but
I ended up fucking your sister instead.

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:56.689
She's hot. Your dad walked in.

01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:01.129
And my boner did not go away.
I didn't need to hear that, Willy.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.527
I guess I'll be seeing you a lot now
that you're hanging out with my sister.

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:10.523
Uh, no, we're not going out
or anything.

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:14.526
It's not like I didn't try,
but she said something like:

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:19.368
"Fish needs a man
like a woman needs a tricycle"?

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:22.046
I don't know.
Something you taught her.

01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:26.888
Hey, speaking of teaching,
I never paid you for the swim lessons.

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:28.883
Wow.
You didn't think I'd give it to you, huh?

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:31.168
No, actually- Right.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:34.722
I'm a changed man, Brandy.

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:40.963
And, if you want, if you have
nothing going on next summer,

01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.282
you wanna come back here
to work,

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.642
there's a manager position
waiting for you.

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:49.851
Wait, what? You're quitting?
Yes.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.321
You just learned how to swim.
You worked so hard.

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:55.006
Yeah, I know, but I think...

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:59.486
I think getting with Amber made me realize
that I could do better, you know?

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:02.962
Your sister's like caviar.
You're like cheese.

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:05.248
Okay, okay, Willy.
Like sharp cheddar.

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:09.564
I tasted a little caviar and I realized,
like, what the fuck am I doing in Boise?

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:14.081
So I'm gonna get out.
I'm gonna see the world,

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.405
and I'm gonna better myself.

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:20.844
Well, I respect that. I actually think
that's very mature of you.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.765
Yeah. I'm gonna follow The Dead.

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:27.080
You know, Jerry's health
isn't doing too well,

01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:29.288
and I'm not getting
any younger, so...

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.601
Totally making
the right decision.

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:50.609
Ladies. Oh, Marce,
you're still homesick?

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.290
Uh-huh.

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.011
Give it another month, Marcy.

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:05.204
Hi there. Cameron.

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:10.564
It's been a while.
I know.

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:14.964
You never returned my electronic mail.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.487
I just...
I think I needed some time.

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:23.044
I understand. And I'm sorry too.
That night was really crazy.

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.645
But I'm glad
that we, like, never had sex.

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.165
Mm-hm.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.322
I think it would've confused
our friendship.

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:31.811
I know what you mean.

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.329
You do?
Yes.

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:39.691
Really?
Mm-hm. I did it. I had sex.

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.247
Wow.

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.324
My roommate and I went out,
a drunk senior came up to me and said:

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.170
"You a freshman?"
I was like, "Yeah."

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.561
Next thing you know,
I'm losing it on the bathroom floor.

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:52.327
Whoa. She just up and took it.
She just up and took it. Heh.

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:55.531
Yeah, but all that to say,
I just want you to know

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:57.921
that I know what you meant
that night.

01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:00.845
That sex is a big deal,
but it's also not a big deal.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.322
Don't get me wrong, it's a big deal,
but it doesn't have to be such a big deal.

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.369
No, it doesn't.

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:09.490
I guess what I mean is,
sometimes sex is just sex.

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:12.650
Yeah, sometimes sex is just sex.

01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:21.486
Yay. Yay. YaY-

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.728
Little circles. Little circles.

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:26.641
Wait, I have an idea.

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:34.167
Oh, my God. Yes.
Cameron, it's happening.

01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:35.964
Cameron, it's gonna happen.

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:51.403
Hey, they're doing a clambake with--
Dad?

01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:54.481
I said, not the back door.

01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:58.167
There's doors we don't do.
The back door's one of them.

01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:00.369
We went over this.

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:06.927
Good job, Cameron.
