00:48.290 --> 00:49.780
(screams)

00:49.825 --> 00:51.759
Oh... oh, my God!

00:51.793 --> 00:53.852
Bill!

00:53.895 --> 00:58.559
Ew! Where you eating nachos?

01:02.504 --> 01:05.337
(Lady Bird groaning)

01:11.847 --> 01:15.681
Mom, why is Mr. Dauterive
kissing Dad?

01:15.717 --> 01:17.480
Oh, Bobby, don’t watch.

01:17.519 --> 01:18.952
We called 9-1-1, shug.

01:18.987 --> 01:21.854
Wow, I can't believe
how fast they've responded

01:21.890 --> 01:26.327
considering I didn't give them
my real address.

01:26.361 --> 01:27.726
(coughing)

01:27.763 --> 01:30.732
What in the hell
is going on?

01:30.766 --> 01:34.202
I smelled something
coming from your house.

01:34.236 --> 01:39.139
Not the usual smell of cooking
and pine cleaner, happiness.

01:39.174 --> 01:40.641
It was gas.

01:40.676 --> 01:41.643
Gas?

01:41.677 --> 01:43.645
Oh, my God, the water heater.

01:50.552 --> 01:53.419
Lady Bird, for the life of me
I don't know what I did wrong

01:53.455 --> 01:55.787
when I installed this unit
yesterday.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.189
(sighs, grumbling)

01:57.225 --> 01:59.193
Hank, the repairman
from the church circular

01:59.227 --> 02:00.854
will be here any minute.

02:00.896 --> 02:02.887
Now, honey, I know that this
is hard for you,

02:02.931 --> 02:06.059
but after last night,
we need a second opinion.

02:06.101 --> 02:07.932
Peggy, I know I can fix it.

02:07.969 --> 02:09.401
Let me give it another shot.

02:09.437 --> 02:10.871
We can't risk it.

02:10.906 --> 02:12.999
I cannot bear the thought
of going to sleep tonight

02:13.041 --> 02:17.410
and waking up with Bill
slobbering on me again.

02:17.446 --> 02:20.847
(gags)

02:20.882 --> 02:22.543
You must be Mr. Walker.

02:22.584 --> 02:25.018
No, Mr. Walker
is what they call my father.

02:25.053 --> 02:26.350
Please call me Mack.

02:26.388 --> 02:29.551
Well, Mack, Reverend Stroup
sure did give you

02:29.591 --> 02:31.752
a shining letter
of recommendation.

02:31.793 --> 02:34.557
She said you were the answer
to the church's sewer problems.

02:34.596 --> 02:36.564
(chuckling)

02:36.598 --> 02:38.156
That's nice to hear.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.189
But I'm not only a plumber,

02:39.234 --> 02:41.202
I'm also a deacon
at the church.

02:41.236 --> 02:44.205
I like to think of myself
as a handyman for God.

02:44.239 --> 02:45.206
Hello.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.299
You must be the repairman

02:47.342 --> 02:50.436
that Peggy called
behind my back.

02:50.479 --> 02:52.413
Mack, this is my husband, Hank.

02:52.447 --> 02:54.415
He's the one
who almost killed us.

02:54.449 --> 02:55.416
(groans)

02:57.519 --> 02:58.918
Uh-huh.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.954
I said the same thing.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.747
(metal clanking)

03:03.959 --> 03:06.291
Mmm. Interesting.

03:06.661 --> 03:07.958
I find it interesting

03:07.996 --> 03:10.521
that you tapped the pipe
with a three-quarter wrench

03:10.565 --> 03:13.398
instead of a five-eighth,
but to each his own.

03:13.435 --> 03:14.402
(sotto voce):
I guess.

03:14.436 --> 03:17.633
Mr. Hill, did you know that I've
been repairing water heaters

03:17.672 --> 03:20.004
and water heater accessories
for over 20 years?

03:20.041 --> 03:21.269
What a coincidence.

03:21.309 --> 03:24.005
I've been selling propane
and propane accessories

03:24.045 --> 03:25.444
for over 20 years.

03:25.480 --> 03:28.608
I bet we both seen a lot
of crazy things in our day, huh?

03:28.650 --> 03:29.912
Boy, I know what you mean.

03:29.951 --> 03:33.284
I had this fella one time...
nice fella, a chiropractor...

03:33.321 --> 03:38.315
(chuckling):
He tried to use
first-stage plastic tubing

03:38.360 --> 03:40.828
for a second-stage regulator.

03:40.862 --> 03:41.829
(both laughing)

03:41.863 --> 03:44.661
I bet I can top that!

03:44.699 --> 03:47.190
I know a guy, installed
a brand-new water heater

03:47.235 --> 03:49.203
without checking
the old Gumson seals.

03:49.237 --> 03:52.263
Next thing he knew,
he woke up on his own front lawn

03:52.307 --> 03:54.275
after his neighbor dragged him
to safety.

03:54.309 --> 03:56.334
Nice fella, propane salesman.

03:56.378 --> 03:58.039
What?

03:58.079 --> 04:00.343
Are you referring to me?

04:00.382 --> 04:01.679
Was that a shot?

04:01.716 --> 04:03.183
That was a shot,
wasn't it?

04:03.218 --> 04:05.914
Look, I need to remove
a section of the drywall

04:05.954 --> 04:07.922
to get to the pipes
for further inspection.

04:10.192 --> 04:11.420
I got to get my Dry Vac

04:11.459 --> 04:14.189
before that dust gets
into the vents.

04:14.229 --> 04:15.662
(growling)

04:15.697 --> 04:17.892
Hey, girl.

04:17.933 --> 04:19.366
(snarling)

04:19.401 --> 04:21.596
Hello. I'm Bobby.

04:21.636 --> 04:27.541
Are you here to fix
the gas leak?

04:27.576 --> 04:30.807
Hey, Bobby, I think
your dog hates me.

04:30.846 --> 04:31.813
(snarling)

04:31.847 --> 04:33.815
I don't know why
you'd think that.

04:33.849 --> 04:35.908
I've never seen her smile
at anyone before.

04:35.951 --> 04:37.282
I got a dog
at home

04:37.319 --> 04:38.650
and I know when a dog

04:38.687 --> 04:40.086
has ill intent
in his heart

04:40.121 --> 04:41.679
and that dog's
looking at me

04:41.723 --> 04:43.987
like I'm a pair of
meat-bone slippers.

04:44.025 --> 04:46.016
(laughing):
"Meat-bone slippers."

04:46.061 --> 04:50.191
I'm going to get a pen
to write that down.

04:50.232 --> 04:52.666
Don't say anything
while I'm gone.

04:52.701 --> 04:55.135
(growling)

04:56.037 --> 04:57.026
(laughing)

04:57.072 --> 04:59.870
Man, Mr. Walker is so funny.

04:59.908 --> 05:03.605
He's got this great routine
about how Lady Bird wants to

05:03.645 --> 05:05.476
(deep voice):
"Rip out my throat."

05:05.513 --> 05:06.343
(laughing)

05:06.381 --> 05:08.474
He asked me to hit her
in the head with a brick.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.677
What in the hell is funny
about that?

05:10.719 --> 05:12.516
Maybe Bobby didn't
tell it right.

05:12.554 --> 05:16.149
(growling)
What's up, girl?

05:16.191 --> 05:17.453
Huh, that's strange.

05:17.492 --> 05:18.982
Mr. Walker, you in there?

05:19.027 --> 05:20.961
WALKER:
Yes, I'm in here.

05:20.996 --> 05:22.395
The door seems to be locked,

05:22.430 --> 05:24.295
but there’s not lock
on this door.

05:24.332 --> 05:25.924
I tied it off
with a cord.

05:25.967 --> 05:29.300
Look, I... I still have
the right to observe your work.

05:29.337 --> 05:30.895
I just want to
finish up the job

05:30.939 --> 05:32.804
without getting
bit by your dog.

05:32.841 --> 05:35.036
My dog would never bite you.

05:35.076 --> 05:36.407
Well, she hasn't
stopped growling at me

05:36.444 --> 05:37.877
since I got here.

05:37.913 --> 05:39.540
(growling)
(gasps):
Right there!

05:39.581 --> 05:40.980
See! She's giving me
the evil eye.

05:41.016 --> 05:42.005
She's a hell hound.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.348
That's not true.
(growling)

05:44.386 --> 05:45.978
You know what she loves?

05:46.021 --> 05:47.989
She loves to have her belly
rubbed.

05:48.023 --> 05:49.991
And I love the use
of all of my fingers.

05:50.025 --> 05:52.721
Come on, give her a rub.
She's sweet.

05:52.761 --> 05:54.319
Okay.

05:54.362 --> 05:55.522
Hold her tight.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.530
I got her.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.531
(whimpering)

05:57.565 --> 05:58.532
See there,
she likes you.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.693
(snarling)
Tell her she's
a good doggie.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.225
Good... doggie.

06:02.270 --> 06:05.171
(baby voice):
Yes, you are.

06:05.206 --> 06:06.537
Yes, you are.

06:06.574 --> 06:09.668
(barks)
Lady Bird,
what's wrong with you?!

06:09.711 --> 06:12.771
(barking)
I'll tell you
what's wrong with her.

06:12.814 --> 06:14.873
She's full of hate.
Black hate!

06:14.916 --> 06:16.941
That is preposterous.
(barking)

06:16.985 --> 06:19.010
What is with all the barking?

06:19.054 --> 06:21.113
Mr. Walker
is upsetting Lady Bird.

06:21.156 --> 06:24.216
I'm upsetting her
because I'm a black man.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.318
(barking)
That is a lie!

06:26.361 --> 06:29.023
You’re just nervous,
which is making her nervous.

06:29.064 --> 06:31.464
Hank, get that dog out of here!

06:31.499 --> 06:32.488
But, Peggy, he...

06:32.534 --> 06:33.523
Now, Hank!

06:33.568 --> 06:34.535
(growling)

06:34.569 --> 06:36.537
Mack, I apologize
for my husband.

06:36.571 --> 06:38.539
He's always had
an unhealthy relationship

06:38.573 --> 06:39.540
with that dog.

06:39.574 --> 06:42.099
Listen, we're making hamburgers
on the grill

06:42.143 --> 06:44.941
and I insist that you join us
for lunch.

06:44.980 --> 06:51.180
I hope you like ketchup.

06:51.219 --> 06:53.187
(sighs):
Can you believe that guy?

06:53.221 --> 06:56.384
First he kicks me off
my own water heater

06:56.424 --> 06:59.291
then he has the nerve
to call Lady Bird prejudiced.

06:59.327 --> 07:01.295
Yeah, man, talking
about ol' Lady Bird, man.

07:01.329 --> 07:03.627
Like dang ol' disposition
of dove, man.

07:03.665 --> 07:04.632
Coo, ooh, ooh, ooh.

07:04.666 --> 07:05.633
You know what I'm saying?

07:05.667 --> 07:07.430
Yeah, Lady Bird's so nice

07:07.469 --> 07:10.632
she'd let someone eat out
of her own bowl.

07:10.672 --> 07:12.071
No matter how drunk they were.

07:12.107 --> 07:15.838
Of course, I'm white.

07:15.877 --> 07:19.813
Thank you for
having me for lunch.

07:19.848 --> 07:21.315
Everything
looks delicious.

07:21.349 --> 07:22.441
Well, thank you,
Mack.

07:22.484 --> 07:23.678
It is.

07:23.718 --> 07:24.685
You know, Mr. Walker,

07:24.719 --> 07:27.347
Lady Bird never acts the way
she did this morning.

07:27.389 --> 07:29.653
I honestly don't know
what got into her.

07:29.691 --> 07:31.659
I guess she was still feeling
the effects

07:31.693 --> 07:33.684
of nearly being gassed
to death last night.

07:33.728 --> 07:35.662
Pickle?

07:35.697 --> 07:37.756
Mr. Hill, I admit,

07:37.799 --> 07:40.791
maybe I threw the race card
at your dog a little too fast.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.736
But I swear I thought
she was going to throw
a few teeth my way.

07:43.772 --> 07:47.469
BOBBY:
"Teeth my way."

07:47.509 --> 07:48.771
(laughing):
Brilliant.

07:48.810 --> 07:49.970
Well, I don't know much

07:50.011 --> 07:51.979
about these kind of things,
Mr. Walker.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.742
But I do know that a man

07:53.782 --> 07:56.842
should not be judged
by the color of his skin

07:56.885 --> 07:59.911
but by the actions of his heart,
I tell you what.

07:59.954 --> 08:01.751
Amen!

08:01.790 --> 08:03.121
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

08:03.158 --> 08:05.058
This is flavorful.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.857
I wish my wife knew her way
around a burger.

08:07.896 --> 08:09.887
Well, let me get
you another one.

08:09.931 --> 08:12.126
All right, but
if my wife calls,

08:12.167 --> 08:13.634
tell her
I just had one.

08:13.668 --> 08:14.635
(chuckling)

08:14.669 --> 08:16.637
(laughing):
Did you hear that?

08:16.671 --> 08:17.638
He's henpecked.

08:17.672 --> 08:21.073
You can't turn this guy off.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.076
(growls)

08:22.110 --> 08:23.907
Call her off!

08:23.945 --> 08:28.882
Good doggie!
Good doggie!
(snarling)

08:28.917 --> 08:30.145
(snarling)

08:30.185 --> 08:31.152
Ow!

08:31.186 --> 08:32.346
Bad doggie!

08:32.386 --> 08:34.582
Lady Bird, no!

08:34.621 --> 08:36.486
(barking)

08:36.524 --> 08:38.355
(snarling)

08:38.393 --> 08:40.258
(barking)

08:40.294 --> 08:41.727
(growls)

08:41.763 --> 08:43.754
Well, I-I don’t think
she broke the skin,

08:43.798 --> 08:45.356
but better safe
than sorry.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.460
Mr. Walker, I accept
full responsibility

08:48.503 --> 08:49.663
for Lady Bird's actions,

08:49.704 --> 08:53.071
but you've got to believe me,
she is not prejudiced.

08:53.108 --> 08:54.973
I know she's not prejudiced.

08:55.009 --> 08:56.101
She's racist.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.509
No, she's not.

08:57.545 --> 08:58.773
She's just getting old

08:58.813 --> 09:01.509
and she must have developed
an acute fear of strangers.

09:01.549 --> 09:02.516
BOBBY:
Hey, Dad,

09:02.550 --> 09:04.450
the mailman is here.

09:04.486 --> 09:06.249
Hello, you must be Mr. Hill.

09:06.287 --> 09:07.276
I'm your new mailman.

09:07.322 --> 09:10.655
Mr. Peters retired yesterday
after 25 years.

09:10.692 --> 09:12.023
Boy, that was some party.

09:12.060 --> 09:13.721
(panting)

09:13.761 --> 09:16.321
Get your dog a chew toy.
I quit!

09:16.364 --> 09:20.858
See you in church!

09:20.902 --> 09:22.665
(sighs)

09:22.704 --> 09:23.671
Yep.

09:23.705 --> 09:24.672
Yep.

09:24.706 --> 09:26.264
Mmm... yep.

09:26.307 --> 09:30.937
My dog is a racist.

09:30.979 --> 09:34.073
She bit that repairman
who happens to be black.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.310
Haven't black people
been through enough?

09:36.351 --> 09:38.717
Yeah, man, talkin' about
all man created equal, man.

09:38.753 --> 09:40.721
Just like dang ol' pursuit
of happiness, too, man.

09:40.755 --> 09:43.223
There's only two ways
to handle it, Hank.

09:43.258 --> 09:46.284
You either shoot her between
the eyes Old Yeller style,

09:46.327 --> 09:48.261
or you sneak up
from behind

09:48.296 --> 09:50.355
and get her in the
back of the head.

09:50.398 --> 09:52.366
Either way, it'll
cost you ten bucks.

09:52.400 --> 09:56.461
I'll choke her for five
and you can keep the head!

09:56.504 --> 09:59.439
PEGGY:
Well, I'll tell you right now

09:59.474 --> 10:01.908
we cannot have that
dog running a muck,

10:01.943 --> 10:04.207
biting every black
person she sees.

10:04.245 --> 10:06.713
It makes us look like
ignorant rednecks.

10:06.748 --> 10:11.947
Oh, and it's bad for
black people, too.

10:11.986 --> 10:12.953
(sighs)

10:12.987 --> 10:14.454
Where did we go wrong, Peggy?

10:14.489 --> 10:19.654
Bobby, I know you're,
uh, knowledgeable

10:19.694 --> 10:24.063
of the black videos
and whatnot.

10:24.098 --> 10:27.693
And right now I need you
to use your love of, uh,

10:27.735 --> 10:30.829
Puffy and Diddy and Snoopy
to help me.

10:30.872 --> 10:32.772
Is it about Lady Bird?

10:32.807 --> 10:34.866
Yes. Yes, it is.

10:34.909 --> 10:39.243
(rapping):
♪ Drivin' down the street
in my Escalade ♪

10:39.280 --> 10:42.875
♪ Drinkin' Cris like Swiss Miss
in a chick parade. ♪

10:42.917 --> 10:43.884
Now, Dad,

10:43.918 --> 10:46.512
you keep petting her
and feeding her treats

10:46.554 --> 10:49.455
while Lady Bird
just takes it all in.

10:49.490 --> 10:50.889
Check out his bling-bling.

10:50.925 --> 10:51.892
♪ ♪

10:51.926 --> 10:52.893
There, there, girl.

10:52.927 --> 10:57.125
Just flow with the nice music
and bling-bling.

10:57.165 --> 10:58.154
Lady Bird, no!

10:58.199 --> 11:00.963
Give them a chance.

11:01.002 --> 11:03.266
Hurry, they're about to have
the pool party!

11:03.304 --> 11:06.205
HANK (sighing):
Lady Bird, don't you get it?

11:06.241 --> 11:08.106
A man should not be judged

11:08.142 --> 11:10.736
by the color of his skin,
but by...

11:10.778 --> 11:14.737
but by the actions of his heart!

11:14.782 --> 11:19.185
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.414
Well, hello, Mrs. Stogner.

11:20.455 --> 11:22.548
How is LuLu doing with
the pillow chewing?

11:22.590 --> 11:26.890
That bitter apple spray
you suggested worked wonders.

11:26.928 --> 11:28.190
Excellent.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.891
Let me guess what this
little lady's problem is?

11:30.932 --> 11:32.900
She looks like a barker to me,
huh?

11:32.934 --> 11:34.902
Bet she keeps the neighbors up
all night. Am I right?

11:34.936 --> 11:35.903
No.

11:35.937 --> 11:38.633
She doesn't bark; she bites.

11:38.673 --> 11:40.231
This sweet dog bites people?

11:40.275 --> 11:42.470
I don't believe it.

11:42.510 --> 11:46.412
Uh, actually,
she only bites, uh...

11:46.447 --> 11:48.745
(whispering):
Black people.

11:48.783 --> 11:50.751
I didn't know she was
a prejudiced pup

11:50.785 --> 11:52.753
when I picked her
from the litter.

11:52.787 --> 11:54.118
She just looked
so darn cute.

11:54.155 --> 11:55.782
Well, that is ridiculous.

11:55.823 --> 11:58.417
I can assure you
that your dog is not racist.

11:58.459 --> 11:59.858
Oh, thank God.

11:59.894 --> 12:01.521
You see,
dogs only follow

12:01.562 --> 12:03.587
subconscious cues
from their owners.

12:03.631 --> 12:07.260
Well,
what does that mean?

12:07.302 --> 12:08.860
That means that you are the one
who is racist, Mr. Hill.

12:08.903 --> 12:10.029
(gasps)

12:10.071 --> 12:11.231
Oh, and by the way,

12:11.272 --> 12:13.740
my girlfriend
is African American.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.504
You sicken me.

12:15.543 --> 12:17.511
(groans)

12:20.815 --> 12:22.146
What's up, Hank?

12:22.183 --> 12:23.673
Not much.

12:23.718 --> 12:26.687
Hey, Roger,
I didn't realize
that was you.

12:26.721 --> 12:28.621
(chuckles nervously)

12:28.656 --> 12:29.554
How are you doing?

12:29.590 --> 12:31.558
Could I get you
a cup of coffee?

12:31.592 --> 12:32.559
I just poured one.

12:32.593 --> 12:33.560
Have you seen the cream?

12:33.594 --> 12:35.061
There you go, Roger.

12:35.096 --> 12:37.394
Some cream
for your coffee.

12:37.432 --> 12:39.730
Whoa! That's enough, Hank.

12:39.767 --> 12:40.791
Is something bothering you?

12:40.835 --> 12:41.802
(sighs)

12:41.836 --> 12:43.770
Well, to be
honest, Roger,

12:43.805 --> 12:46.000
I was accused
of being a racist.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.507
Hank Hill a racist?

12:47.542 --> 12:49.533
But you got me my job here.

12:49.577 --> 12:52.978
Wait. The guy who called you
that, was he wearing a bow tie?

12:53.014 --> 12:56.347
It's not a pretty thing
to be accused of

12:56.384 --> 12:57.408
I tell you what.

12:57.452 --> 12:59.420
You're really shook up
about this.

12:59.454 --> 13:01.547
Look, I know
you're not like that.

13:01.589 --> 13:03.557
But if it'll make you
feel better,

13:03.591 --> 13:05.559
you should take
this Internet test

13:05.593 --> 13:06.560
my brother-in-law
made us take

13:06.594 --> 13:07.561
last Thanksgiving.

13:07.595 --> 13:08.562
It's a good test.

13:08.596 --> 13:11.622
Said I was "racially unbiased"
and I love gay people.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.634
I didn't see that one coming,
but I'm happy.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.727
Roger, show me this test.

13:15.770 --> 13:17.294
Faster, Hank!

13:17.338 --> 13:19.306
If you don't finish
within the time limit,

13:19.340 --> 13:20.307
it voids the test!

13:20.341 --> 13:22.571
But I don't remember
what keys to press.

13:22.610 --> 13:25.135
Does the letter "E"
stand for white or black?

13:25.179 --> 13:26.203
And what's "I"?

13:26.247 --> 13:27.214
Is it good or bad?

13:27.248 --> 13:28.215
I don't know.

13:28.249 --> 13:29.147
Just push one!

13:29.183 --> 13:31.151
You don't have time
to think about it.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.152
That's how the
test works.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.483
It's on a
subconscious level.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.715
Go, go, go!

13:34.756 --> 13:36.314
This thing is so...

13:36.357 --> 13:38.222
Hey, guys.

13:38.259 --> 13:39.419
What's going on?

13:39.460 --> 13:41.121
Hank's taking
the racist test.

13:41.162 --> 13:43.289
Oh, wow.
Is he a racist?

13:43.331 --> 13:44.389
We don't know yet.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.229
I'm trying to concentrate.

13:46.267 --> 13:49.293
Yeah, what are you,
some kind of racist?

13:49.337 --> 13:50.463
You're almost there, buddy.

13:50.505 --> 13:52.234
Quiet.

13:52.273 --> 13:54.503
This test has to be
some kind of a joke.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.136
I mean how can it determine
if you're racist or not?

13:57.178 --> 13:58.372
Almost done.

13:58.413 --> 13:59.380
Just a couple more.

13:59.414 --> 14:03.350
There, you're finished.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.614
Now we just wait
while it tallies up your score.

14:05.653 --> 14:07.484
Well, I don’t think

14:07.522 --> 14:09.490
you can really go by something
like this.

14:09.524 --> 14:10.718
I'm sure it's more of a game.

14:10.758 --> 14:12.749
You know, for fun.

14:12.794 --> 14:13.761
(chuckles)

14:13.795 --> 14:16.696
"Your test results show
that you strongly prefer

14:16.731 --> 14:18.665
the company of white people."

14:18.699 --> 14:19.666
What?!

14:19.700 --> 14:21.827
Wow, and the "strongly"
is flashing.

14:21.869 --> 14:23.097
Ugh! Man!

14:23.137 --> 14:26.072
This test is 100% incorrect.

14:26.107 --> 14:28.735
I do not prefer
white people over...

14:28.776 --> 14:29.743
others.

14:29.777 --> 14:35.909
Roger, tell 'em.

14:35.950 --> 14:37.918
I poured you cream!

14:45.726 --> 14:47.990
Monday's the earliest
I could schedule a repairman

14:48.029 --> 14:49.360
to fix the water heater.

14:49.397 --> 14:52.298
But I boiled up some water
for a sponge bath

14:52.333 --> 14:54.301
and had enough left over
for a cup of tea

14:54.335 --> 14:56.769
a cup of soup
and a boiled egg.

14:56.804 --> 14:57.862
Fine.

14:57.905 --> 14:58.872
What's wrong?

14:58.906 --> 15:00.567
You can have the egg.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.702
I took this stupid
racial preference test

15:03.744 --> 15:06.235
on the Internet today
in front of the whole office

15:06.280 --> 15:07.542
and failed miserably.

15:07.582 --> 15:10.881
The results claim
that I only like white people.

15:10.918 --> 15:13.978
A test?

15:14.021 --> 15:16.046
Come on, faster, Peggy.
You're nearly done.

15:16.090 --> 15:17.853
Don't rush me!

15:17.892 --> 15:20.417
I can't even remember
what keys to push here.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.122
See? I told you
it was stupid.

15:22.163 --> 15:24.427
There's no way this test
can determine anything.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.524
I can't even believe
I'm taking it.

15:26.567 --> 15:27.898
There. There,
you've finished.

15:27.935 --> 15:30.870
Now it adds up
your crazy score.

15:30.905 --> 15:32.930
You know, I don't even care
what it says

15:32.974 --> 15:35.169
because this test
is absolutely Stu...

15:35.209 --> 15:37.541
Oh, yeah!

15:37.578 --> 15:40.513
Strongly prefer
the company of black people?

15:40.548 --> 15:43.517
Well, you can’t argue
with results, Hank.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.714
Quite honestly,
I think it's a pretty good test.

15:46.754 --> 15:48.847
Honey, check to see
if there’s paper in the printer.

15:48.890 --> 15:50.016
I want to make a copy.

15:50.057 --> 15:54.460
CHOIR:
♪ Amen. ♪

15:54.495 --> 15:57.862
Please be seated.

15:57.899 --> 16:00.663
For today's sermon, I'd like all
the children of the flock

16:00.701 --> 16:03.192
to gather up front.

16:07.375 --> 16:09.843
You sicken me.

16:12.013 --> 16:13.037
Can anyone tell me

16:13.080 --> 16:14.445
what color this is?

16:14.482 --> 16:15.449
ALL:
White.

16:15.483 --> 16:16.450
How about this one?

16:16.484 --> 16:17.451
ALL:
Black.

16:17.485 --> 16:19.453
Very good.

16:20.621 --> 16:23.522
Did you know that God created
all the colors

16:23.558 --> 16:25.583
and loves them all equally?

16:25.626 --> 16:28.720
That's why he puts them
in the same box.

16:28.763 --> 16:31.960
Unfortunately, there are some
people in the world

16:31.999 --> 16:35.400
who would prefer to keep white
crayons in their own box

16:35.436 --> 16:40.032
separate from the other crayons.

16:48.950 --> 16:50.679
(sighs)

16:52.253 --> 16:54.619
Hank, Reverend Stroup
loaned us a tool

16:54.655 --> 16:56.145
to help with our burden.

16:56.190 --> 16:59.216
And by virtue of my desire
to be around black people,

16:59.260 --> 17:02.354
I will help guide you
on the road to recovery.

17:02.396 --> 17:05.160
What am I supposed
to do with these?

17:05.199 --> 17:06.996
They're racial tolerance dolls.

17:07.034 --> 17:09.229
You practice interacting
with them.

17:09.270 --> 17:11.464
I will not play
with dolls.

17:11.505 --> 17:13.473
Do you want me to tell
Reverend Stroup

17:13.507 --> 17:14.473
you wouldn't even try?

17:14.508 --> 17:16.442
(sighs)
What do I have to do?

17:16.477 --> 17:19.002
The first step
to recovery is to admit

17:19.046 --> 17:21.013
that you have a problem
with black people.

17:21.048 --> 17:22.015
But I don't.

17:22.049 --> 17:25.815
A man should not be judged
by the color of his skin,

17:25.853 --> 17:27.012
but by the actions...

17:27.054 --> 17:29.488
Admit it!

17:29.523 --> 17:31.548
Sorry, Hank,
but it's part of the treatment.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.392
Now admit it!

17:35.429 --> 17:37.397
If you found those dolls
in my room,

17:37.431 --> 17:39.922
I swear I've never seen them
before.

17:39.967 --> 17:41.935
Relax, Bobby.
They belong
to your father.

17:41.969 --> 17:44.028
Dad plays with dolls?

17:44.071 --> 17:45.038
Mm-hmm.

17:45.072 --> 17:47.233
No, I'm not playing
with dolls.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.299
I'm, uh,
interacting with them.

17:49.343 --> 17:54.508
Oh. Can I interact
with the dolls, too?

17:54.548 --> 17:55.674
(sighs)

17:55.716 --> 17:59.174
Sure, son, let's
interact together.

17:59.220 --> 18:03.247
(high voice):
Hello, have you seen

18:03.290 --> 18:07.317
a big fluffy kitty
running around here?

18:07.361 --> 18:09.625
What's your kitten's name?

18:09.664 --> 18:11.962
We call her Whiskers,

18:11.999 --> 18:14.866
but she’ll answer
to Kee-Kee.

18:14.902 --> 18:16.631
Here, Kee-Kee-Kee-Kee-Kee.

18:16.671 --> 18:17.763
(sighs)

18:17.805 --> 18:20.103
Uh, come on, Kee-Kee.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.439
Where are you?

18:22.476 --> 18:24.171
(doorbell rings)

18:24.211 --> 18:26.304
I'll get it.

18:26.347 --> 18:28.679
You two just keep on
looking for that cat.

18:28.716 --> 18:31.310
Maybe your cat
is under the table.

18:31.352 --> 18:32.717
Here, Kee-Kee.

18:32.753 --> 18:37.622
Lady Bird, no! Wait!

18:37.658 --> 18:39.387
Lady Bird, drop it!

18:39.427 --> 18:41.691
Dear Lord, we have formed
a prayer circle

18:41.729 --> 18:45.187
to pray
for Hank Hill's racist heart.

18:45.232 --> 18:47.894
(barking)

18:47.935 --> 18:50.563
(all gasp)

18:55.910 --> 19:00.279
BILL:
♪ Come on, people now,
smile on your brother♪

19:00.314 --> 19:03.750
♪ Everybody get together♪

19:03.784 --> 19:10.451
♪ Got to love one another

19:11.559 --> 19:16.189
PEGGY:

on your right.

19:16.230 --> 19:18.425
(grunts)

19:18.466 --> 19:21.458
So, you got yourself
a leak, do you?

19:21.502 --> 19:22.935
Well, don’t you worry.

19:22.970 --> 19:25.097
I'll fix her good as new.

19:25.139 --> 19:26.936
Uh, you might want to...

19:26.974 --> 19:29.841
I got a magnetic screwdriver
you can use.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.368
You're dropping the screws
on the floor.

19:32.413 --> 19:34.210
You're going
to lose them.

19:34.248 --> 19:37.479
Look, you called me
because you needed my help,

19:37.518 --> 19:41.113
so if you'll just let me
do the job.

19:41.155 --> 19:42.122
(growling)

19:42.156 --> 19:43.646
What's wrong,
Lady Bird?

19:43.691 --> 19:44.658
(yelling)

19:44.692 --> 19:45.659
Get your dog off of me!

19:45.693 --> 19:46.921
Lady Bird, stop!

19:46.961 --> 19:48.155
What in the world?

19:48.195 --> 19:50.629
I don't know what got into her.

19:50.664 --> 19:53.098
She just started biting
this... white guy.

19:53.134 --> 19:54.533
This dog is crazy!

19:54.568 --> 19:55.967
Getaway! Ow! Ow!

19:56.003 --> 19:58.062
Lady Bird's biting
a white guy.

19:58.105 --> 19:59.504
A white guy, Peggy.

19:59.540 --> 20:01.269
That dog trainer was right.

20:01.308 --> 20:04.641
Lady Bird did pick up
on my subconscious cues.

20:04.678 --> 20:06.839
But I don't hate
black people.

20:06.881 --> 20:08.405
I hate repairmen.

20:08.449 --> 20:09.473
Hey, hey!

20:09.517 --> 20:12.077
You were upset
that you couldn't
fix the heater

20:12.119 --> 20:16.351
and so that's
why Lady Bird
attacked Mack.

20:16.390 --> 20:17.755
Is Reverend Stroup
still here?

20:17.792 --> 20:18.850
She's got to see this.

20:18.893 --> 20:21.225
Let's go get her
before they start
another song.

20:21.262 --> 20:24.288
Wait! Don't leave me! Help!

20:24.331 --> 20:25.298
Coming.

20:25.332 --> 20:26.299
Hello?

20:26.333 --> 20:29.734
Good Lord!

20:29.770 --> 20:31.931
Mr. Walker,
please open the door.

20:31.972 --> 20:33.337
The Klan meeting's
been moved

20:33.374 --> 20:34.534
to The Pancake House.

20:34.575 --> 20:37.100
Please, I can explain
everything.

20:37.144 --> 20:40.841
I assure you
Lady Bird will not bite you.

20:40.881 --> 20:42.849
Yeah, I've heard
that one before.

20:42.883 --> 20:44.009
You don't understand.

20:44.051 --> 20:46.519
Lady Bird didn't bite you
'cause you're black.

20:46.554 --> 20:48.522
She sensed that it
really bothered me

20:48.556 --> 20:51.047
having someone work
on my water heater.

20:51.091 --> 20:52.115
Really?

20:52.159 --> 20:54.150
Yeah. She just bit
another repairman.

20:54.195 --> 20:56.220
A white guy. I checked.

20:56.263 --> 20:58.788
And he's Scotch-Irish
all the way back.

20:58.833 --> 20:59.800
(sighs)

20:59.834 --> 21:02.166
I swear to you on my 20 years

21:02.203 --> 21:04.865
of selling propane
and propane accessories

21:04.905 --> 21:09.774
that my dog and I
are not racist.

21:09.810 --> 21:13.268
(gasps)

21:13.314 --> 21:17.774
See there?
She does like you.

21:17.818 --> 21:21.879
Aw, you're a good doggy,
aren't you?

21:21.922 --> 21:23.321
Yes, you are.

21:23.357 --> 21:24.324
Yes, she is.
