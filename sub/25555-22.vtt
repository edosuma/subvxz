an immediate connection.

explaining like,

39:16.187 --> 39:17.722
how me and Codi
have really grown,

39:17.788 --> 39:18.989
I think it's warming his heart

39:19.056 --> 39:20.157
and he's actually seeing like,

39:20.224 --> 39:21.926
the genuine person
that I am.

39:21.992 --> 39:24.161

39:36.207 --> 39:37.875

39:39.610 --> 39:43.214

each other for 27 years.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.349

40:04.068 --> 40:05.903
And I finna chase too

40:05.970 --> 40:09.306
So y-- so you think
you could hook up with Codi?

40:09.373 --> 40:11.876
What do you mean, I think
I could hook up with Codi?

40:11.942 --> 40:13.911
Uh...

40:13.978 --> 40:15.379
I mean, I don't know
what to say.

40:15.446 --> 40:17.248
Codi asked me
on a date.

40:17.314 --> 40:19.183
And at that time,
I was in a relationship,

40:19.250 --> 40:20.818
and so I told him no.

40:20.885 --> 40:22.319
{\an1}It wasn't because
I wouldn't go out with Codi

40:22.386 --> 40:24.054
it was 'cause I was
in a relationship.

40:24.121 --> 40:25.389
But I don't know...

40:25.456 --> 40:27.625
{\an5}So you're not in
a relationship now?

40:25.456 --> 40:27.625
{\an3}No.

40:27.691 --> 40:29.426
{\an5}(Codi)
My dad is having
a talk with Candace,

40:29.493 --> 40:31.195
and Candace is talkin'
to my dad.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.863
I have no idea
what either one of them

40:32.930 --> 40:34.231
is saying right now.

40:34.298 --> 40:37.802
So if Codi asked you out,
you'd be willing to go?

40:37.868 --> 40:40.171
(Candace)
If he asked me out.

40:40.237 --> 40:42.173
I'm just sayin'...

40:42.239 --> 40:46.443
{\an1}if Codi asked you out,
you would be willing to go?

40:46.510 --> 40:49.246
I'm like, wow.

40:49.313 --> 40:50.915
Uh, yikes.
