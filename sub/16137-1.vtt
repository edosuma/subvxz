WEBVTT

01:39.499 --> 01:41.233
Woman: Brady?

01:42.235 --> 01:44.536
- Hey, babe, it's me.

01:47.107 --> 01:51.043
Hey. I took the red-eye,
i wanted to surprise you.

01:51.045 --> 01:53.112
- Surprise.

01:53.114 --> 01:54.913
So, how was it?

01:54.915 --> 01:57.683
- It was great, actually.
- Good.

01:57.685 --> 02:01.286
- I met dmc. Run dmc.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.655
- What?
- Yeah. He's adopted, too.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.158
He was telling me he spent
his entire life in queens

02:06.160 --> 02:08.060
just a couple blocks away
from his birth mother.

02:08.062 --> 02:09.895
Never knew it.
- Wow.

02:09.896 --> 02:12.331
- And they were talking about
fate and if he wasn't adopted,

02:12.333 --> 02:14.633
would he ever have been
in run dmc? It was cool.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.469
- That's crazy.
It's like you.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.105
See? It's fate, babe.

02:20.107 --> 02:22.307
- Fate, god, whatever,
I'm happy.

02:22.309 --> 02:26.512
- Oh, cougar breath.
- Okay.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.681
A little role-play,
no kissing. I like it.

02:29.683 --> 02:33.519
- I'm on my period, babe.
- That's okay. Okay.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.254
I remember when we
first started dating.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.122
We'd have sex whether
you were on your period

02:37.124 --> 02:39.057
or the house was burning down.

02:39.059 --> 02:41.693
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

03:09.155 --> 03:11.924
- What the fuck is this?
- What is that?

03:11.926 --> 03:15.194
"She told me she had
a boyfriend the morning after."

03:15.196 --> 03:17.095
- Wait, what?
Where did you get that?

03:17.097 --> 03:19.331
- Maybe if you didn't nag me
to put the toilet seat up

03:19.333 --> 03:22.334
all the time...
Let me see the string.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.835
- What?
- You have your period.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.003
Let me see the string!

03:26.273 --> 03:29.708
- Look, Brady, I'm sorry.

03:29.710 --> 03:33.946
I got really drunk, I didn't
know what I was doing.

03:33.948 --> 03:36.615
I'm sorry.

03:36.617 --> 03:40.786
- Well, happy fucking birthday
to me.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.604
Man: What?

03:59.806 --> 04:04.977
"Gremlins"? You want me to do
a reboot of "gremlins"?

04:06.846 --> 04:09.548
Okay, I tell you what.

04:09.550 --> 04:12.951
I will do a remake
of "gremlins," but this time

04:12.953 --> 04:16.988
can't it be a racist
commentary against white people?

04:16.991 --> 04:20.459
Yeah. Well, the original
was just a racist movie

04:20.461 --> 04:22.494
about a bunch of troublemaking
dark-skinned critters

04:22.496 --> 04:24.529
afraid of water,
break dancing to rap music,

04:24.531 --> 04:26.999
staying up all night and eating
fucking fried chicken.

04:29.068 --> 04:30.435
Hello?

04:30.437 --> 04:31.970
Fuck, dude.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.106
- How long do you think
this has been going on for?

04:34.108 --> 04:37.276
'Cause I replay it like--
- dude. Fuck her.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.877
Come on. It's your birthday.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.846
Let's get shit-canned. Do
you have to work this weekend?

04:40.848 --> 04:43.815
- Yeah, I do, actually. I have
to fucking take meetings

04:43.817 --> 04:46.285
for that lesbian action movie,
"hurricane dykes."

04:46.287 --> 04:48.920
- All right, I should be
fucking directing that.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.556
Come on. Can't you get me
a meeting sy?

04:51.558 --> 04:52.958
- You can maybe get him
a cup of coffee.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.060
- I thought you were
my best friend. Wow.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.863
- I can't just get you a job,
okay? That's not how it works.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.998
- No, it's fine. You'll see.
One day

05:00.000 --> 05:02.367
I'm gonna have a project that's
gonna blow your fuckin' mind...

05:02.369 --> 05:04.403
But you'll just pass it up

05:04.405 --> 05:06.805
'cause you're thinkin'
about your fucking girlfriend.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.408
Ex-girlfriend.
- What are you working on now?

05:09.410 --> 05:11.476
- Funny you should ask.
'Cause I've got

05:11.478 --> 05:13.979
the most amazing fucking story
you've ever heard.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.181
"Batshit," tale to the heart
of darkness,

05:16.183 --> 05:19.451
classic black-hat villain,
twists, turns, danger, drugs.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.386
Unexpected love.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.388
- Sounds great, man.
- Sounds fucking great.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.790
- You guys ready to order?

05:24.792 --> 05:26.725
- I'd like the French toast,
please

05:26.727 --> 05:28.927
and more coffee, whenever
you get a chance. Thanks, man.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.762
- And for you?
- Yeah, eggs florentine

05:30.764 --> 05:32.831
with the poached, and a bagel
instead of the English.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.633
- Did you just get a bagel?
- Yes, I did.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.335
- I'm impressed. Wow.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.570
- If you caught your brother
with his dick in a bagel hole

05:38.572 --> 05:40.138
when you were 11.

05:40.140 --> 05:43.508
- He likes lots of cream cheese.
- No cream cheese.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.610
I don't think I can ever
have cream cheese again.

05:45.612 --> 05:49.081
But thanks.
- Thanks, man.

05:49.083 --> 05:50.549
- Oh, hey, look.
Before I forget.

05:50.551 --> 05:54.686
Happy birthday, buddy.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.154
- Wow!

05:56.156 --> 05:59.324
You really broke out Bruce's
black card for this, huh?

05:59.326 --> 06:01.093
- Look at it.

06:01.794 --> 06:03.428
- Tijuana?

06:03.430 --> 06:06.631
- Tijuana? What do you think,
I'm half a fag?

06:06.633 --> 06:09.334
Tijuana's for pussy tourists
and college students.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.169
You know what? I thought
we could get a couple

06:11.171 --> 06:13.939
of wheelchairs and role-play
"born on the fourth of July."

06:13.941 --> 06:15.741
Dude, your girlfriend
cheated on you.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.677
So you've got no choice
but to go to Mexico,

06:18.679 --> 06:20.045
find the dirtiest hotel room

06:20.047 --> 06:22.080
and fuck the grossest hooker
we can find.

06:22.082 --> 06:25.484
So no, I am not taking you
to Tijuana.

06:25.486 --> 06:29.154
I am taking you
to the "real" Mexico.

06:50.877 --> 06:52.744
Drug roulette? Drug roulette?
- No.

06:52.746 --> 06:56.415
I don't want to play
drug roulette, man.
- Come on.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.116
- Have you actually been
to mexicali before?

06:58.118 --> 07:00.185
What's the danger level
we're looking at here?

07:00.187 --> 07:03.822
- It isn't number one on the
top ten most dangerous
cities in Mexico.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.258
Okay, look,
would you stop worrying?

07:06.260 --> 07:09.461
Please. Come on, dude, look.
I've taken care of everything.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.563
- Does your dad know you
have this?

07:11.565 --> 07:13.432
- Mm. Only way that soulless
bastard shows affection.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.468
- Yeah, at least you got one
to be disappointed in, man.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.736
- Didn't you find your real dad?

07:17.738 --> 07:19.504
Granted, he's got a whole
other family

07:19.506 --> 07:21.540
and doesn't give two shits
about you

07:21.542 --> 07:23.742
but fucking look at you, man.

07:23.744 --> 07:26.411
You are one step away
from the most powerful guy

07:26.413 --> 07:27.646
in Hollywood.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.748
Who, by the way,
treats you more like a son

07:29.750 --> 07:31.516
than my dad does me.

07:33.853 --> 07:37.856
What's the yellow one?
Is that Adderall or Propecia?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.834
Okay. That's like
the tenth fucking time

07:48.836 --> 07:50.702
you've checked that phone
in the past five minutes.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.537
Do you want me to turn around?
- No.

07:52.539 --> 07:54.606
No, no, no, no. Fuck that bitch,
right? Fuck her.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.641
- That's right. Yeah.
Fuck that whore, dude.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.076
What happened to that one chick?

07:58.078 --> 08:00.645
That hot Asian girl
from the "green inferno" party?

08:00.647 --> 08:04.716
- She had a penis.
- Oh, right, she did.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.719
- She was hot, too. Too bad.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.488
- Too bad. She had a penis.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.923
- Yeah, I'll tell ya,
I'd rather date a tranny

08:11.925 --> 08:14.092
than date one of those
giant muscle chicks.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.428
Did you ever see that porno
with that chyna wrestler?

08:16.430 --> 08:17.662
- No, man.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.731
- Her clit was so
fucking huge,

08:19.733 --> 08:21.766
it was like a bloated,
boiled cashew.

08:21.768 --> 08:24.803
- Gross, man. I changed
my mine. I want to turn around.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.271
We're gonna turn this
around.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.306
- Just forget about Janie.
Okay? Forget about her.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.643
These next three days are
about you. We're gonna get
fucked up,

08:31.645 --> 08:32.977
we're gonna drink
some fucking Tequila...

08:32.980 --> 08:34.613
We're gonna do some drugs,

08:34.615 --> 08:35.746
we're gonna fuck
some Mexican hookers.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.616
- And have my kidneys--
oh, shit!

08:37.618 --> 08:39.116
What the fuck?

08:39.119 --> 08:42.821
- Now that's a fuckin'
serendipitous moment

08:42.823 --> 08:44.623
if I ever did fuckin' see one.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.025
- Jesus Christ, dude, pull over.
Pull over, wipe it off.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.895
- No, no, no, no, no.
It's good to drive into Mexico

08:49.897 --> 08:52.163
looking gangster.
Leave that fucking shit.

09:22.762 --> 09:24.262
- Fuck, man! Why are you
walking so fast?

09:24.264 --> 09:26.097
- Let's get something to eat
before we get banged up.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.699
- I'm not eating there,
though, bro.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.234
- Don't you ever watch
Anthony bourdain?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.869
These are the best places
to eat. Street food.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.304
Food of the people.
Right,<i> hombre?</i>

09:32.306 --> 09:33.772
- And in like 20 minutes,

09:33.774 --> 09:36.007
I'm doing my best
Jackson pollock in my pants.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.842
- Hey, where I come from...
If you can voluntarily shit

09:37.844 --> 09:40.545
your pants on your birthday,
it's one to remember.

09:40.547 --> 09:42.447
- That's gross.
- Okay.

09:42.449 --> 09:47.185
Look... I am sorry your girl
fucked some other dude,

09:47.187 --> 09:50.755
I really am. But who knows?
Maybe it was meant to be.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.458
Maybe you were supposed
to come with me to Mexico.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.461
You might meet another girl.
At least get your mind off her.

09:56.463 --> 09:59.664
It's your birthday. Can't you
forget this shit for one night

09:59.666 --> 10:01.833
and have some fun?

10:03.035 --> 10:06.104
- Okay. Fine. Fine, fine.

10:06.106 --> 10:10.175
-<i> Dos,</i> uh, let's see um...

10:26.926 --> 10:29.594
- Thank you.<i> Gracias.</i>
<i> Gracias.</i>

10:29.596 --> 10:31.896
- You guys gotta be careful
around here.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.733
They'll feed you that tainted
shit just to ruin your night.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.835
- Well, to what do we owe this?

10:36.837 --> 10:38.169
Well, you guys are Americans,
aren't you?

10:38.171 --> 10:39.871
We have to look out
for one another.

10:39.873 --> 10:43.108
What gave it away?

10:43.110 --> 10:44.809
- He was gonna feed you
the kidney meat

10:44.811 --> 10:46.678
of the last two American guys
we saw here.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.213
- That's not...

10:48.215 --> 10:49.981
- Okay. Okay. All right.
- I'm kidding.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.116
Lucia here spotted you.

10:51.118 --> 10:54.419
- Oh, a little Florence
Henderson.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.887
- It's nightingale, cowboy.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.223
Be careful here, boys.
We can help you with tacos,

10:58.225 --> 11:00.725
but we can't help you
with the mexicali cartel.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.193
You mix up with them,

11:02.195 --> 11:05.563
they fuck white boys like you
for an appetizer.

11:05.565 --> 11:09.501
- Oh. You didn't say anything
about the mexicali cartel, man.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.903
- Dude, this isn't Tijuana.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.039
- Don't worry, you'll be fine.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.907
Just don't be flashing your cash
around in bars.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.809
You'll end up with a sack
over your head

11:17.811 --> 11:19.778
and a trip to see
<i> El gato enfermo.</i>

11:19.780 --> 11:22.347
- Where's <i> El gato enfermo?</i>

11:22.349 --> 11:24.182
- Oh, not where. Who.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.985
He runs this town.
And his specialty

11:26.987 --> 11:29.287
is kidnapping rich,
white American boys

11:29.289 --> 11:32.157
whose fathers
will gladly pay quickly.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.125
- Well, I'm an orphan, so...

11:34.127 --> 11:36.161
- And my dad's gay
and homeless.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.196
- I hear that's hereditary.
So you'll be sleeping

11:38.198 --> 11:40.732
on the streets
and sucking dick in no time.

11:40.734 --> 11:44.202
- Lucia.
- So,<i> El gato,</i> what's that mean?

11:44.204 --> 11:47.072
-<i> El gato enfermo,</i> the sick cat.

11:47.074 --> 11:50.208
- And how does one get
such an endearing nickname?

11:50.210 --> 11:53.745
- Well, his father was the most
feared man in all of Mexico.

11:53.747 --> 11:58.083
He used to cut off the pubic
hair of everyone he killed.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.785
Just as a souvenir.
And keep it around the house.

12:00.787 --> 12:03.154
When El gato was a little boy,
he saw

12:03.156 --> 12:05.790
his brother get murdered
right in front of his eyes.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.425
When they found El gato
afterwards,

12:07.427 --> 12:10.729
they say he was curled up
in a ball,

12:10.731 --> 12:12.230
covered in his brother's blood,

12:12.232 --> 12:16.835
coughing up pubic hair
fur balls. The sick cat.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.603
- Wow.
- That is quite the fairy tale.

12:18.605 --> 12:21.606
But we're not wealthy so
there's nothing to worry about.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.575
- Well, see you later.
- Whoa, come on.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.910
What do you say?
Two guys, two girls?

12:25.912 --> 12:27.912
Last time I checked that's...

12:27.914 --> 12:30.782
Unless you guys are,
you know...

12:30.784 --> 12:33.718
Okay, come on. Wouldn't it be
nice to go out with some guys

12:33.720 --> 12:37.088
who can cook you dinner
without having to steal
the chicken first?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.357
- You're an asshole.

12:39.359 --> 12:45.797
- Don't worry about her.
- She's

12:45.799 --> 12:47.932
but I guess I should go
meet up with her,

12:47.934 --> 12:49.501
so maybe I'll see you guys
later.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.703
- Well, hold on, look,
let me get your number.

12:51.705 --> 12:55.874
Maybe we can hang out,
even if it's not here,
but you know, eventually.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.684
- It's not gonna work here,
babe.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.553
Call me
when you're in the U.S.?

13:08.555 --> 13:10.088
- I wanna see you before that.

13:10.090 --> 13:13.458
- Hey, hombre, how do you say
"desperate" in Spanish?

13:14.994 --> 13:17.428
-<i> Zona norte.</i>
That's where we'll be.

13:17.430 --> 13:20.932
Maybe I'll see you?
- I hope so.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.967
Tonight's my birthday.
- Oh.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.370
Happy birthday!

13:34.847 --> 13:37.115
- Uppers, downers,
black beauties,

13:37.117 --> 13:41.319
chemicals, Anthrax.
- Did he just say Anthrax?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.121
- Howdy, boys.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.422
They call me texican.

13:44.424 --> 13:47.992
And I can get you guys
anything you want.

13:47.994 --> 13:51.729
- Oh. Okay.
<i> ¿donde esta zona norte?</i>

13:51.731 --> 13:54.933
-<i> "¿Donde esta zona norte?"</i>

13:54.935 --> 13:56.868
You gotta be kiddin' me.
You guys lookin' for girls?

13:56.870 --> 14:00.572
I can get you girls.
What else you want?

14:00.574 --> 14:03.174
- Oh, no, man. I just want
to know where zona norte is.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.210
- Come on, gringo. You wanna
experience the real Mexico?

14:05.212 --> 14:09.314
I'm your guy. I'll tell you
what. Give me $500.

14:10.716 --> 14:14.719
- Oh, shit.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.955
-<i> ¿Que Paso?</i>

14:16.957 --> 14:19.290
- Are you guys
fucking robbing us?

14:19.292 --> 14:21.826
You work
for <i> El grando rancho?</i>

14:21.828 --> 14:23.761
- Robbin'? No.

14:23.763 --> 14:27.131
Protection? Yes.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.900
This is <i> El caballo.</i>

14:28.902 --> 14:31.636
Give us $500
and we'll be your tour guides.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.505
All-inclusive. I'm a walkin',
talkin' resort of debauchery.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.975
And I think you're talkin'
about <i> El gato enfermo...</i>

14:36.977 --> 14:39.244
And I suggest
you steer clear of him.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.912
He's like
the aborted offspring

14:40.914 --> 14:42.680
if jaws had raped
Jeffrey dahmer,

14:42.682 --> 14:44.916
then John Wayne gacy
dug it out of a dumpster,

14:44.918 --> 14:46.551
ate it and shit it out.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.986
- All right, well,
we'll do our best.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.021
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.423
Don't be slingin' that shit
around here, tough guy.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.959
El gato's boys see that,
it'll get bad, fast.

14:54.961 --> 14:57.996
Hey, look, you guys wanna
have some fun?

14:57.998 --> 14:59.430
Steer clear of El gato.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.867
And let us take you
to the real Mexico.

15:02.869 --> 15:05.603
- What's the real Mexico?

15:11.143 --> 15:13.711
- You boys wanna go
to a cockfight?

15:16.683 --> 15:19.217
- Whoo!

15:29.561 --> 15:33.231
- Pretty cool, huh?
- No. I hate chickens.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.733
- You and herzog. Thought these
things were just urban legend.

15:35.735 --> 15:40.838
- Hell no, man. This is the real
Mexico! Mexico <i> es magico!</i>

15:40.840 --> 15:42.373
Ain't that right, caballo?

15:42.375 --> 15:44.309
- Some say Jesus would have
been born here,

15:44.311 --> 15:46.678
but they couldn't find
three wise men or a virgin.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.947
- Come on, man. Let's go back
to zona norte, huh?

15:48.949 --> 15:50.615
- Come on, cowboy.
Thought you guys wanted

15:50.617 --> 15:52.417
to have a night to remember?
- Seriously, Brady,

15:52.419 --> 15:54.185
it's your fucking birthday.
Live a little.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.721
- It's your birthday? Shit.
<i> Feliz cumpleanos,</i> man!

15:56.723 --> 15:58.690
- Texican here, he's gonna
get you so <i> jodido,</i>

15:58.692 --> 16:00.458
people are gonna mistake
you for Stephen Hawking.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.627
- We can't do that, man.
Okay? We're in Mexico.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.363
All right, we're gonna get
our fucking kidneys stolen.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.434
- Gentlemen, look,
you have my word,

16:09.436 --> 16:12.770
caballo here, you got
no worries, that's his job.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.872
358 to me, 142 to caballo.

16:14.874 --> 16:18.142
We do this shit all the time.
He's fuckin' liquid around here.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.245
<i> Esta es mi hombre</i>
<i> de la mierda!</i>

16:21.247 --> 16:23.881
15 years, me and caballo,
we come down here,

16:23.883 --> 16:24.983
meet tourists, take them out,

16:24.985 --> 16:26.751
they have the time
of their life.

16:26.753 --> 16:30.421
Go home safe and sound.
I haven't lost a' one.

16:30.423 --> 16:33.491
- Look, I don't know you, man,
okay? How can I trust you?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.860
You got like a website
or something?

16:35.862 --> 16:37.328
- Boom.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.998
I'm as American as blue jeans,
budweiser

16:40.000 --> 16:41.599
and James motherfuckin'
Cameron.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.535
Caballo's my half-cousin.
I come down here on weekends

16:44.537 --> 16:47.905
to meet guys like you, make
money. It's a buyers' market.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.407
- You see that? We're fine.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.242
This guy's a fucking
government official!

16:51.244 --> 16:54.078
It's 100% safe. Come on.

17:06.425 --> 17:10.560
Come on.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.262
- Yeah!

17:13.699 --> 17:16.467
- Kill that fucking thing!

17:16.469 --> 17:19.002
- Bathroom, now!

17:19.005 --> 17:22.740
-<i> Baño,</i> thattaway.
All-inclusive.

17:25.844 --> 17:27.310
- This just feels too easy, man.

17:27.313 --> 17:30.048
I mean, the guy just appears
out of nowhere

17:30.050 --> 17:32.150
with his giant freak
of a sidekick

17:32.152 --> 17:35.486
he shows us some I.D.,
and then we go with him.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.555
- Dude, you saw his I.D.,
it's legit.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.491
- No. No, it looks like
he made it at a los kinkos.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.860
- Dude, look, do you remember
that time I ended up

17:42.862 --> 17:45.363
in Compton smokin' crack
in that hotel with that hooker

17:45.365 --> 17:46.998
with the giant bush
and pancake tits,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.033
looked like she was straight
out of national geographic?

17:49.035 --> 17:50.701
- Yeah. Right.
- Right?

17:50.703 --> 17:55.406
People fuckin' love that story.
This night has to top that.

17:55.408 --> 17:59.110
Do you got that?
That night, this night.

17:59.112 --> 18:02.313
That night, this night.
Okay? Stay focused.

18:02.315 --> 18:05.683
This night.
Come on, let's have fun.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.652
- Okay, you're good,
you're good, you're good,

18:07.654 --> 18:09.554
you're good, you're good,
you're good.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.389
I'm not good. I'm not good.

18:11.391 --> 18:14.725
Tommy. Tommy, hold on, man.
Listen.

18:14.727 --> 18:18.129
- Hey, hey, look.
It's your birthday.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.964
I'm your best friend.

18:19.966 --> 18:25.103
And I promise I won't let
anything happen to you.

18:25.871 --> 18:27.605
Okay?

18:27.607 --> 18:30.475
- All right. Yeah.
- So what now?

18:30.477 --> 18:32.243
We don't have to clean up
tamale wrappers

18:32.245 --> 18:34.011
or anything, do we?

18:34.013 --> 18:37.615
- Well, you guys want to get
<i> borracho correcto,</i> right?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.717
- I don't know
what that means, but yes.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.854
Well, you came to see
the right man. See that guy?

18:42.856 --> 18:44.555
Kasape suka there?

18:44.557 --> 18:48.025
- Yeah.
- He's a famous aztec shaman.

18:48.027 --> 18:50.661
And he's gonna give you guys
the night of your lives.

18:50.663 --> 18:55.199
But can't do that
'til he's ready.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.801
- When's he gonna be ready?

19:01.006 --> 19:02.440
- Now.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.816
- This is so weird.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.919
- It's only weird
if you make it weird, kwasini.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.155
- Okay, gentlemen.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.423
Door #1.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.259
Door #2.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.294
And door #3.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.329
- He's Wayne Brady, now.
- This ain't no

19:25.331 --> 19:27.732
"let's make a motherfuckin'
deal" here, pussy meat.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.800
- What is this? Like, peyote,
mushrooms, what?

19:29.802 --> 19:32.370
- Wait! There ain't no fucking
alprazolam in these things,

19:32.372 --> 19:35.173
are there? I got a major fuckin'
allergy to that shit.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.841
I once took my mom's Xanax,

19:36.843 --> 19:40.211
shit my pants in a best buy
and almost fuckin' died.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.246
- What?

19:43.348 --> 19:45.650
-<i> A mix of psilocybin, mdma,</i>
<i> Coca leaves,</i>

19:45.652 --> 19:49.654
<i> a little fairy dust, mellow.</i>
<i> Basically, if you're a pussy.</i>

19:50.856 --> 19:52.623
<i> The finest psilocybins</i>
<i> you can find,</i>

19:52.625 --> 19:54.725
<i> laced with just the right</i>
<i> amount of opium,</i>

<i> a touch of peyote,</i>
<i> these are the frank zappas.</i>

<i> A mixture of a rare</i>

<i> and fire ants. You'll probably</i>
<i> puke or shit your pants.</i>

20:09.908 --> 20:13.344
- These are the Jim morrisons.
- That looks like a dried bat.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.812
- Ever take those?

20:14.814 --> 20:18.749
- I believe anything worth
doing is worth overdoing.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.518
- Great, yeah. I'm gonna take
number one.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.254
- What?
- Star child.

20:23.256 --> 20:26.824
I was made for loving you, huh?

20:26.826 --> 20:28.526
That is a bitch move.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.628
- Yeah, fuck it.
Okay, yeah, fuck it.

20:30.630 --> 20:34.365
We're gonna do number two.
<i> Dos</i> frank zappas,<i> por favor.</i>

20:34.367 --> 20:36.867
-<i> Quatro numero dos, por favor.</i>

20:36.869 --> 20:38.569
- No... four?
Did you just order four?

20:38.571 --> 20:40.071
I don't want four.
I don't want four.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.173
I want <i> dos.</i> I'm not gonna
double dose, man.

20:42.175 --> 20:44.742
- Hey, hey. Nobody said we had
to do this shit sober, did they?

20:44.744 --> 20:47.778
- What?
- What are those?

20:47.780 --> 20:52.283
- Those? Those are
the g.G. Allins.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.018
Nobody wants those.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.956
- What is that? What's so funny?

21:23.448 --> 21:27.184
- Go thou
and fill another room in hell.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.886
- I can feel my teeth.
- Yeah, me too.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.255
- No, man, like I feel like
they're vibrating.

22:04.257 --> 22:07.325
- I can feel my teeth are
vibrating. They're vibrating.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.628
- You getting grabbed
the wrong way?

22:10.630 --> 22:12.763
- You guys are okay,
you know?

22:12.765 --> 22:14.932
These are some good
'shrooms, though.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.435
These are some good
fuckin' 'shrooms, though.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.537
You feel your teeth vibrate
yet?

22:19.539 --> 22:22.340
- Yes. Yes. Is that bad?
Is that good?

22:22.342 --> 22:23.641
It's bad, I got cancer.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.644
- Nah, he's fucking
with you, cowboy.

22:26.646 --> 22:29.480
- It's bad. It's bad.

22:50.802 --> 22:52.703
- Take some more.
Eat up, cowboy.

22:52.705 --> 22:56.140
- Dude, I ain't you, man.
I can handle my drugs.

23:03.582 --> 23:06.350
- You know, there ain't nothin'
for a bad trip

23:06.352 --> 23:08.986
like buryin' your face
in a pair of tits.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.689
It's like goin' back
to the place we once were.

23:11.691 --> 23:14.692
I truly believe that.

23:14.694 --> 23:19.964
I swear if I could, I'd crawl
right up inside a vagina.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.767
Take a nap.

23:23.368 --> 23:25.403
It's fluffy in there.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.171
Pillowy.

23:29.508 --> 23:32.143
I like fluffy.

23:35.580 --> 23:39.683
You look like you're gonna shit
your pants, boy.

23:39.685 --> 23:42.153
Have some Tequila.

23:46.958 --> 23:48.225
Excuse me?

23:48.227 --> 23:51.061
...accident with that orange
county lumber truck.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.129
Excuse me?

23:52.131 --> 23:56.667
Can I have some...

24:00.172 --> 24:03.774
- What the fuck
are you doin', pigfucker?

24:03.776 --> 24:06.010
I can see it in your eyes,
you're scared.

24:06.012 --> 24:09.814
You see, the devil,
he's riding your bumper.

24:09.816 --> 24:12.850
Unless you speed up,
he's liable to take the lead.

24:12.852 --> 24:16.854
And trust me, young buck,
you don't want that.

24:18.056 --> 24:21.358
But why would he be coming
after you?

24:21.360 --> 24:24.295
He only goes after bad people.

24:24.297 --> 24:28.365
And if he's down there
punishing all them bad people,

24:28.367 --> 24:31.635
doesn't that make him
the good guy?

24:33.338 --> 24:38.509
You need to take a couple
steps back from the ledge,
cocksauce.

24:39.177 --> 24:41.712
I got something for you.

24:49.921 --> 24:53.591
- What is that?
- Drink it. It'll help.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.626
- How do I know it'll help?

24:55.628 --> 24:58.395
- Just drink it
and shut the fuck up.

24:58.397 --> 24:59.997
- What's that?

25:00.932 --> 25:03.634
Argh...!

25:04.870 --> 25:08.572
- Trust me, crisco,
you want to drink it.

25:08.574 --> 25:10.574
- I don't... ah...

25:17.182 --> 25:18.983
- Caballo, are you okay?

25:18.985 --> 25:21.986
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

25:21.988 --> 25:25.422
Are you puking?
Are you pooping? Ugh!

25:25.424 --> 25:27.925
- Both,<i> amigo.</i>

25:32.164 --> 25:36.534
- Crisco! Drink it!
- I'll drink it. I'll drink it.

25:48.013 --> 25:52.483
Shit!
We gotta get outta here!

25:54.554 --> 25:57.254
Get out, get out!

26:04.229 --> 26:06.597
Oh, fuck, man!

26:07.499 --> 26:09.500
You're supposed
to be watching us!

26:09.502 --> 26:11.035
- Holy shit! Chick with a dick!

26:11.037 --> 26:13.304
- Only weird
if you make it weird.

26:13.306 --> 26:17.007
- Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

26:18.844 --> 26:20.578
You're laughing.
Why are you laughing?

26:20.580 --> 26:23.147
- I just saw a guy
get his throat cut.

26:23.149 --> 26:26.717
- Come on. Think about it.
Is that really what you saw?

26:26.719 --> 26:30.054
'Cause I don't know about you,
but I saw her pouring

26:30.056 --> 26:32.022
fucking grand Marnier
down his neck.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.557
- Really?

26:33.559 --> 26:36.060
- Yes. Dude, it's okay,
take a deep breath.

26:36.062 --> 26:39.597
You're just freakin' out.
You're good. It's all good.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.332
- Man, we gotta get outta
Mexico. Okay?

26:41.334 --> 26:44.034
I've seen this movie before.
It doesn't end well.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.070
- Yeah, well,
I've also seen the movie

26:46.072 --> 26:47.805
where the guy gets the girl.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.674
- You guys look like shit.

26:51.509 --> 26:54.111
Wanna party at our hotel?

26:58.283 --> 27:00.684
- I'm sorry, should we get
another room?

27:00.686 --> 27:01.919
- Hell, no.
Group stuff gets me off.

27:01.921 --> 27:04.088
Let's make this shit freaky.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.056
- I'm not gonna do any gay shit
with that kid, though.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.958
I'm just throwing that
out there now.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.027
- Bro, come on. Like it'd be
any different than that time

27:10.029 --> 27:12.396
we went to Vegas.
- That was one time,

27:12.398 --> 27:13.998
that was with my t-ball coach

27:14.000 --> 27:15.933
and it's because I really,
really wanted to pitch.

27:15.935 --> 27:19.403
- You guys are fucked up.
- That's my balloon.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.005
- Oh, what, this?
- Yeah.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.641
- Your balloon?
- Yeah, I really--

27:23.643 --> 27:25.309
don't, don't... okay.

27:27.747 --> 27:31.215
Okay, all right.
I can deal with this.

27:42.794 --> 27:44.328
All right...

27:44.330 --> 27:46.897
- We're gonna play
a little game called "horse."

27:46.899 --> 27:49.533
- All right, look, I'm down
for some kinky shit

27:49.535 --> 27:51.902
but I do cross the line
at animals.

27:51.904 --> 27:56.774
- No, like basketball.
H-o-r-s-e. Like this.

27:56.776 --> 27:59.910
You're up, hooker.

28:01.479 --> 28:03.881
- Hey, what the fuck is that?

28:03.883 --> 28:07.384
- I think they used to make
webcam shows in here.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.353
Don't worry, it's broken.

28:09.355 --> 28:13.757
- Oh, you bad girl.
Okay, how 'about this?

28:15.160 --> 28:17.895
- Oh, okay, now we're getting
somewhere.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.797
- Well, it is Brady's birthday.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.266
We have to do
something exciting.

28:22.268 --> 28:24.535
- Please don't get an h,
please don't get an h,

28:24.537 --> 28:27.037
please don't get an h.

28:27.039 --> 28:31.008
Oh, this is the best game
of all time. I love this game.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.976
- Yes, actually,
i do have a suggestion.

28:32.978 --> 28:35.212
Before you get to o-r-s-e,

28:35.214 --> 28:38.716
why not just get right
to the b and the j?

28:38.718 --> 28:40.851
- All good things, baby.

28:40.853 --> 28:44.254
Now I want you to stick
your tongue up his ass.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.824
- What?
- No, I'm not doing that.

28:46.826 --> 28:50.694
- Well, I guess you're gonna
get your h then.

28:50.696 --> 28:52.696
- Do it. Do it.
- Wait.

28:52.698 --> 28:54.698
- Fine.
- Fine?

28:54.700 --> 28:56.333
- Fine.
- Fine.

28:56.335 --> 28:57.835
- Fine.
- All right.

28:57.837 --> 29:01.772
- ...your pants off. Jesus.

29:01.774 --> 29:06.043
I can't, I can't. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

29:06.045 --> 29:09.279
- I can't. I really like you,
but not on the first date.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.715
- It's totally okay, believe me.
- Okay, how about this?

29:11.717 --> 29:13.250
- Ow! What the fuck was that?

29:13.252 --> 29:14.718
- Oh, shit!

29:14.720 --> 29:16.453
- That was a little
too mapplethorpe for me.

29:16.455 --> 29:19.156
Shut the fuck up, it's part
of the game. Katie, hit him.

29:19.158 --> 29:23.127
- No, Luc, I just think--
- hit him!

29:23.129 --> 29:26.930
- Ow.
- No, no, no, no. Like this.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.165
- Oh! Oh, fuck!

29:28.167 --> 29:30.768
- Okay, what the fuck is this,
guys?

29:30.770 --> 29:33.637
Come on, let us
out of here already.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.405
- You're not going anywhere,
stud.

29:35.407 --> 29:38.909
- Oh, yeah, no. I don't need
this shit, it's my birthday.

29:38.911 --> 29:41.645
- Exactly. And the party's
just getting started.

29:41.647 --> 29:43.781
Now it's time
to insert something.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.749
No. Nope, fuck that.

29:45.751 --> 29:49.019
- Katie, I know you're not
getting your o on this one.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.524
- Ah!

30:14.479 --> 30:17.214
Tommy? Tommy!

30:18.716 --> 30:22.052
Oh, shit.

30:22.054 --> 30:25.355
What the fuck?
I can't breathe.

30:25.357 --> 30:28.625
Wait. Wait a minute.
Why are you doing this?

30:28.627 --> 30:30.060
- You'll find out soon enough.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.296
- You fucking bitch!
Where's Katie?

30:32.298 --> 30:36.133
Katie! Katie! Katie!
- That's not her real name.

30:36.135 --> 30:39.937
What the fuck does it matter?
- I can't breathe.

30:39.939 --> 30:43.006
I'm allergic to most sedatives.
Please...

30:45.110 --> 30:48.212
- Jesus Christ, that wasn't
part of the deal.

30:51.850 --> 30:55.018
There's no way both of you
are allergic.

30:57.222 --> 31:00.424
- I think I'll take my chances.
- No, no!

31:24.048 --> 31:26.149
Well, I guess
he got what he paid for.

31:26.151 --> 31:27.985
- What the hell are we supposed
to do with him?!

31:27.987 --> 31:30.821
- We'll let his guys
handle it.

31:30.823 --> 31:33.957
- God.
- Okay.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.298
- Help! Help!

31:41.300 --> 31:44.401
- Shh, shh, shh.

31:44.403 --> 31:47.271
Look, you can make this
easy on yourself.

31:47.273 --> 31:50.507
Just be quiet, and I won't
fucking shoot you, okay?

31:50.509 --> 31:52.109
It's simple.

31:52.111 --> 31:56.013
Listen to me. If I'm not here,
listen to Katie.

31:56.015 --> 31:59.483
And everything will be okay.

32:50.969 --> 32:54.538
It's okay. Just don't do
anything stupid.

32:58.977 --> 33:02.045
Help!

34:34.304 --> 34:36.639
-<i> Our top story tonight,</i>
<i> rumors swirling around</i>

34:36.641 --> 34:39.708
<i> that the head of the most</i>
<i> dangerous cartel in mexicali,</i>

34:39.710 --> 34:43.213
<i> Adan algonto verde,</i>
<i> has possibly kidnapped</i>

34:43.215 --> 34:45.014
<i> more American tourists</i>

34:45.016 --> 34:46.817
<i> in the hopes</i>

34:46.819 --> 34:51.822
<i> No word from the streets</i>
<i> as to who these people are...</i>

35:23.955 --> 35:27.858
- Hey, homey!

35:39.937 --> 35:43.206
- Come on, flip over.

35:43.941 --> 35:46.443
- I did 15 years in jail,<i> puto.</i>

35:46.445 --> 35:49.146
Sometimes I miss it.

35:49.148 --> 35:53.483
You know why?

36:21.779 --> 36:23.780
- Now if you scream,
I'll give you another shot

36:23.782 --> 36:25.282
and I don't want to have
to do that.

36:25.284 --> 36:28.151
Even though the doctor said
i could.

36:28.153 --> 36:33.523
You might wanna have
a little bit of fun
so don't scream, okay?

36:39.830 --> 36:41.631
That's hot.

36:41.633 --> 36:46.336
- Why are you guys doing this?
What do you want?

36:47.471 --> 36:48.905
And where's Tommy?

36:48.907 --> 36:50.607
He looked so fucked up.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.876
I saw them take him out
last night.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.477
I just... I'm begging you.

36:54.479 --> 36:56.846
- Begging me to what?
Let you go?

36:56.848 --> 37:00.984
- Yes! Yes!
No, I don't fucking know!

37:00.986 --> 37:02.352
Just stop playing this song

37:02.354 --> 37:04.621
and stop blowing smoke
in my face

37:04.623 --> 37:07.357
and just take these fucking
socks off of me!

37:07.359 --> 37:10.694
- Look who's a lot tougher
when he's scared.

37:11.929 --> 37:13.997
- Where's Tommy?

37:15.600 --> 37:18.935
- When I get sad,
i tend to get angry.

37:20.538 --> 37:23.974
And when I'm angry,
i do mean things.

37:23.976 --> 37:26.710
Now let's get those socks off.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.030
Katie!

37:47.032 --> 37:50.000
- Oh, keep doing that.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.704
- Hey, it's him.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.309
- Hello?

37:59.311 --> 38:01.211
<i> What? Nothing.</i>

38:01.213 --> 38:04.381
<i>He was asking about his friend.</i>

38:04.383 --> 38:06.583
He's fine. I mean,
the doctor was here,

38:06.585 --> 38:08.652
he said the drugs haven't
affected him

38:08.654 --> 38:11.321
and we can use as much as
we need if he gets rambunctious.

38:11.323 --> 38:13.923
The worst it can do is
give him a headache.

38:16.894 --> 38:19.562
You know I won't.

38:19.564 --> 38:20.930
- What did he say?

38:20.932 --> 38:23.600
- If the money isn't here
in 48 hours,

38:23.602 --> 38:25.535
he'll be here just in case.

38:25.537 --> 38:26.736
- Well, that's great, right?

38:26.738 --> 38:28.872
Whatever we can do
not to piss him off.

38:28.874 --> 38:31.808
- Have you ever heard the story
about how he became who he is?

38:31.810 --> 38:33.610
I mean, how he took over
and everything?

38:33.612 --> 38:35.478
- Parts of it, yeah.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.980
Why? You?

38:36.982 --> 38:39.215
- His father was the most
feared man in Mexico,

38:39.217 --> 38:40.984
the famous
esquelletto Fernandez.

38:40.986 --> 38:44.120
The third son of a third son.
And the oldest was set

38:44.122 --> 38:46.489
to take over, but something
was eating esquelletto.

38:46.491 --> 38:50.493
He had a sinking feeling
his eldest, his heir, was gay.

38:50.495 --> 38:54.464
<i> And for an old-school Mexican</i>
<i> kingpin, a</i> no bueno.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.800
So, to prove it,
he built this torture chair,

38:56.802 --> 39:00.270
<i> where a string was tied to the</i>
<i> trigger of a gun all the way--</i>

39:00.272 --> 39:04.641
- hey! Who are you talking
about? Huh? Where's Tommy?

39:05.710 --> 39:07.777
- Drink this.
- No. What the fuck is that?

39:07.779 --> 39:10.113
- Sweetie, we can't have you
having a number two

39:10.115 --> 39:12.682
while we're here.
- Then what? I shit my pants?

39:12.684 --> 39:15.552
- No, the idea is that
you don't do that at all.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.425
I have to go check
on something.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.871
Can't leave that there.

39:59.830 --> 40:02.799
- I can't stand that song.

40:04.535 --> 40:06.136
- Hey, Katie?

40:08.506 --> 40:11.141
I guess that's not
your real name, right?

40:12.109 --> 40:14.477
What is your real name?

40:15.813 --> 40:17.914
Come on, I thought
we had something.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.283
You telling me all of it
was an act?

40:20.285 --> 40:24.954
All of it? The taco stand
and coming here with me?

40:24.956 --> 40:26.990
I mean, come on.

40:30.995 --> 40:33.329
Fine, if you don't want
to talk to me,

40:33.331 --> 40:36.866
just please don't put that song
back on.

41:00.524 --> 41:05.195
- Let me guess,
you'd rather hear... eminem.

41:05.197 --> 41:08.665
- Rap? No.

41:08.667 --> 41:12.569
Especially not some
white guy acting black.

41:12.571 --> 41:14.437
- Okay, let me guess again.

41:14.439 --> 41:17.240
You love led zeppelin

41:17.242 --> 41:19.709
and the rolling stones.

41:19.711 --> 41:25.048
- Give me a skinny English
white guy on drugs

41:25.050 --> 41:26.282
and I'm set.

41:26.284 --> 41:27.951
- But I thought you said

41:27.953 --> 41:30.587
you didn't like white guys
acting black.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.622
- Acting black.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.324
- Are you kidding?

41:34.326 --> 41:37.694
Zeppelin and the stones,
they literally ripped off

41:37.696 --> 41:41.998
everything the old blues
legends ever made. Verbatim!

41:42.000 --> 41:44.601
I mean, the two most popular
rock bands

41:44.603 --> 41:48.238
in the history of music
are the biggest wiggers of all.

41:56.247 --> 41:59.382
- Hey, Katie. Katie, come on.

41:59.384 --> 42:02.485
I know you're not like this,
okay?

42:02.487 --> 42:04.988
You're better than this, I know.

42:04.990 --> 42:07.156
- You don't know me. At all.

42:07.158 --> 42:09.659
- What are you doin'
with Lucia?

42:09.661 --> 42:12.595
You can help me.
Please, just help me.

42:12.597 --> 42:15.298
- Nobody turns their back
on El gato.

42:16.667 --> 42:19.569
- El gato? Is that who that is?

42:19.571 --> 42:23.273
You told me he kidnaps kids
with rich parents. I'm adopted.

42:23.275 --> 42:25.675
My mom has nothing!
I just met my dad

42:25.677 --> 42:28.545
for the first time a couple
years ago! He hates me!

42:28.547 --> 42:30.013
- What?

42:30.015 --> 42:32.982
Brady, what are you saying?

42:32.984 --> 42:36.386
I thought your dad was loaded.
- No.

42:36.388 --> 42:39.222
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What?

42:41.625 --> 42:44.260
Lucia! Lucia! Stop, stop!

42:44.262 --> 42:48.898
Katie, get out of here!
Look, we are in deep this.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.434
We have to get this guy's dad
to cough up with the money,

42:51.436 --> 42:52.969
and fast.
The other guy, Tommy...

42:52.971 --> 42:54.137
- Yeah?

42:54.139 --> 42:56.005
- They left him in the dumpster.
He's dead.

42:56.007 --> 42:59.609
- What? What did you just say?

42:59.611 --> 43:00.877
You fucking killed Tommy?

43:00.879 --> 43:03.813
You fucking bitch!
You fucking bitch!

43:30.341 --> 43:32.408
- Where's Katie?
- Oh, please stop with that.

43:32.410 --> 43:35.511
What, are you two
havin' a fucking love affair?

43:35.513 --> 43:37.880
- Why am I naked?

43:46.290 --> 43:47.924
Fuck.

44:04.375 --> 44:07.343
Stop!!

44:07.345 --> 44:09.245
Oh, shit.

44:09.247 --> 44:11.180
- The more we do this,

44:11.182 --> 44:13.349
the faster your dad
will cough up the money.

44:13.351 --> 44:16.019
- My dad... I don't know my dad,
i keep telling you.

44:16.021 --> 44:20.390
I don't know my dad,
he's not... stop, stop, stop.

44:23.461 --> 44:25.261
- Whoa! Oh! Oh!
- What the fuck!

44:25.263 --> 44:27.096
- You're crazier than
a shithouse rat.
Do you know that?

44:27.098 --> 44:28.965
- You're like the fucking
pretzel in the party mix.

44:28.967 --> 44:30.133
Do you know that?

44:30.135 --> 44:31.801
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Boring!

44:31.803 --> 44:34.170
- All you had to do is stay
here and watch him,

44:34.172 --> 44:36.706
not torture him with fucking
chickens nipping at his balls!

44:36.708 --> 44:40.910
- Did you talk to gato?
- Yes. We're fucked.

44:40.912 --> 44:42.779
- What does that mean?
What's the story?

44:42.781 --> 44:45.314
- The story is that
you fucked up major!

44:45.316 --> 44:48.351
It was the other guy
we needed! Tommy.

44:48.353 --> 44:52.355
He's the one with the rich dad.
And now he's dead.

44:52.357 --> 44:55.058
He doesn't have any parents.
He's a fucking orphan!

44:55.060 --> 44:57.460
- So what do we do?
Do we just kill him?

44:59.497 --> 45:02.465
- El gato's gonna decide.

45:02.467 --> 45:04.834
- Do you want to hear
the rest of the gato story?

45:04.836 --> 45:06.169
- Katie, don't go!

45:06.171 --> 45:07.603
- So the string
tied to the trigger,

45:07.605 --> 45:10.473
it's like run down
to this system of pulleys

45:10.475 --> 45:13.676
<i> and at the other end,</i>
<i> it's tied to his dick.</i>

45:13.678 --> 45:15.411
- Katie!!!
- The sick fuck.

45:15.413 --> 45:19.515
<i> Then rolls in a TV</i>
<i> and puts on gay porn,</i>

45:19.517 --> 45:22.018
<i>hoping his son gets an erection</i>

45:22.020 --> 45:23.820
which then pulls the string

45:23.822 --> 45:26.756
<i> attached to the trigger</i>
<i> via the pulleys,</i>

45:26.758 --> 45:30.526
so he shoots himself
with his own penis.

45:30.528 --> 45:33.129
So gato...

45:33.131 --> 45:37.366
<i> Was just hiding</i>
<i> behind bags of matter.</i>

45:38.435 --> 45:40.737
<i> And bam!</i>

45:41.638 --> 45:43.973
The gun went off.

46:10.634 --> 46:13.503
You're not gonna spit
on me again.

46:28.685 --> 46:31.287
- How long are we gonna
do this for?

46:31.289 --> 46:34.390
I get it now.
You guys fucked up.

46:34.392 --> 46:38.661
You wanted Tommy.
You took me. You fucked up.

46:38.663 --> 46:41.364
I get it.

46:41.366 --> 46:44.801
You guys are fucked up.
Why don't you just let me go?

46:44.803 --> 46:47.703
Give me like a five minute
head start. You can chase me.

46:47.705 --> 46:49.172
- It's tempting.

46:49.174 --> 46:51.741
- Come on, with those long
praying mantis legs of yours,

46:51.743 --> 46:53.543
you'd love it.

46:53.545 --> 46:55.711
- Yeah, but you get five miles
into the desert

46:55.713 --> 46:58.414
and at night it's so cold,
you'd freeze to death.

46:58.416 --> 47:01.717
- You remind me of the girls
i used to meet in foster care.

47:01.719 --> 47:03.686
- Where was your foster home?

47:03.688 --> 47:05.922
- New bedford, Massachusetts.

47:08.225 --> 47:10.593
I tell you what, I tell you
my worst resident story,

47:10.595 --> 47:12.094
you tell me yours.

47:12.096 --> 47:14.897
- What makes you think
i was in a foster home?

47:14.899 --> 47:16.599
- Takes one to know one.

47:18.202 --> 47:20.369
- My friend, Wilma,
was from Puerto Rico.

47:20.371 --> 47:23.072
We were inseparable
when we were like 12.

47:23.074 --> 47:24.674
- You still talk to Wilma?

47:24.676 --> 47:27.076
- Wilma's dead.

47:27.078 --> 47:30.546
- I'd say I'm sorry,
but I'm not.

47:33.183 --> 47:36.052
How?
- Wilma was really William.

47:36.054 --> 47:40.857
William
and his brother, Phillip.

47:40.859 --> 47:42.725
Identical. When Willy
was eight months old,

47:42.727 --> 47:47.096
his parents decided that he
and Philly should be
circumcised.

47:47.098 --> 47:50.800
Problem was, in Puerto Rico,
they used cauterization

47:50.802 --> 47:53.703
and the doctor fucked up.
And instead of fixing it,

47:53.705 --> 47:57.206
he convinced his parents

47:57.208 --> 48:00.910
to raise him as Wilma.

48:00.912 --> 48:03.346
At around 12,
Willy started getting urges.

48:03.348 --> 48:05.648
Girls, fighting,
pee standing up.

48:05.650 --> 48:07.316
But the problem was,

48:07.318 --> 48:11.354
Willy was raised as Wilma,
and Wilma didn't have a Willy.

48:12.789 --> 48:14.156
Enough small talk.

48:14.158 --> 48:16.859
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, hold on.

48:16.861 --> 48:19.528
Let me help you.
I want to help you.

48:19.530 --> 48:21.931
Okay, I want
to get out of here.

48:21.933 --> 48:24.000
You guys obviously want
to get paid.

48:24.002 --> 48:25.501
You know who I work for?

48:25.503 --> 48:28.604
My boss is sy ginsburg.
You know who that is?

48:28.606 --> 48:30.773
He's like one of Hollywood's
biggest producers.

48:30.775 --> 48:32.708
He's a fucking millionaire.

48:32.710 --> 48:35.311
- You know, some of the times
the guys' families don't pay

48:35.313 --> 48:40.283
and the cartel comes and just
kills the poor sons of bitches.

48:40.285 --> 48:42.285
I think people just
don't respect Mexicans.

48:42.287 --> 48:44.687
They feel like they're less
civilized than whites.

48:44.689 --> 48:46.522
And that really pisses them off.

48:47.224 --> 48:48.925
If El gato shows up here,

48:48.927 --> 48:51.994
well, then you know
it's all gone wrong.

48:53.397 --> 48:55.498
All right, enough chit chat.

48:55.500 --> 48:57.767
- No, no, wait, wait,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

48:57.769 --> 49:00.569
You told me your resident story,
let me tell you mine.

49:00.571 --> 49:02.271
It's worse.

49:02.273 --> 49:04.740
- Bullshit.
- Mnh-mnh.

49:04.742 --> 49:08.411
There was this kid, and they
had him in one of those...

49:08.413 --> 49:10.379
You know those fuckin'
padded timeout rooms?

49:10.381 --> 49:12.548
They had him in there
for so long

49:12.550 --> 49:15.484
they thought
he was gonna kill himself.

49:15.486 --> 49:18.521
So they like took all of
his clothes, his shoelaces,

49:18.523 --> 49:21.857
everything. They kept him
in there for months, just nude.

49:21.859 --> 49:24.260
But he was so determined.

49:25.963 --> 49:27.997
He pulled out his big toenail,

49:27.999 --> 49:29.865
sharpened it on the floor,

49:29.867 --> 49:32.468
used it to slit his wrist.

49:33.403 --> 49:35.738
- Jesus, that kid's got
determination.

49:35.740 --> 49:38.708
- That kid... was me.

50:22.786 --> 50:24.353
Okay, okay.

50:24.355 --> 50:26.822
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

50:26.824 --> 50:32.261
Yes. Okay. Come on. Come on.

50:34.331 --> 50:38.067
No, no, no, no, no.

50:38.069 --> 50:40.770
No, no, no, no.
No!

50:41.972 --> 50:45.775
Okay, okay, okay.

51:42.899 --> 51:44.867
Lucia: <i> You get five miles</i>
<i> into the desert</i>

51:44.869 --> 51:48.170
<i> and at night it's so cold,</i>
<i> you'd freeze to death.</i>

52:04.521 --> 52:08.324
- Wait, stop, stop, stop!
How ya doin'? How ya doin'?

52:08.326 --> 52:10.893
Uh, uh, uh...
<i> ¿estados unido? Unido estado!</i>

52:10.895 --> 52:12.561
Please, please, stop, stop!

52:12.563 --> 52:14.530
- It's <i> estados unidos,</i> brother.

52:14.532 --> 52:17.266
- I need to get outta here.
Help me, please?

52:17.268 --> 52:20.369
- Don't mind my friend,
but get in, motherfucker.

52:22.272 --> 52:23.672
Don't worry about him.

52:23.674 --> 52:26.442
- I need to get outta here.
Help me, please.

52:26.444 --> 52:28.344
- What do you mean, outta here?
We're locked in

52:28.346 --> 52:30.746
for hundreds of miles.
I can get you to a phone, yeah?

52:30.748 --> 52:35.284
- Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
Just fuckin' drive, man.

52:35.286 --> 52:40.422
- I like your fuckin'
underwear there, toots.
Don't I know you?

52:40.424 --> 52:44.693
- Yeah, yeah, from the cockfight
and the... the strip club.

52:44.695 --> 52:47.596
- In the prime of his years,
he married gargamel,

52:47.598 --> 52:49.798
daughter of the king
of the butterflies.

52:49.800 --> 52:52.768
A fine, good-looking
piece of machine.

52:52.770 --> 52:57.706
And the pair of them often
played the two-backed beast,

52:57.708 --> 53:01.043
joyfully rubbing
their bacon together.

53:01.045 --> 53:02.811
All right, puss n boots,
where you coming from really?

53:02.813 --> 53:06.815
- These... fucking girls, man,
they kidnapped me,

53:06.817 --> 53:09.785
they took... thumbtacks
and-and-and-and...

53:09.787 --> 53:12.788
And fuckin'
they played this music, man!

53:12.790 --> 53:17.226
I need to get to the border.
Just drive, okay? Please.

53:17.228 --> 53:19.795
- Ahem!

53:19.797 --> 53:23.232
Aside from the kinky shit,
what do you do?

53:23.234 --> 53:25.701
- I work for a movie producer.
- Movies?

53:25.703 --> 53:28.804
Ah, lala never allowed them
on the reservation.

53:28.806 --> 53:31.941
He said they're all just racist
propaganda films, you know?

53:31.943 --> 53:33.442
I mean, look at "star wars."

53:33.444 --> 53:36.745
Pious white people
fighting this evil black guy?

53:37.747 --> 53:40.916
Have you ever really looked
at darth vader?

53:40.918 --> 53:42.618
I mean, side shot, profile.

53:42.620 --> 53:45.487
He looks like a big,
black dick, doesn't he?

53:45.489 --> 53:47.623
I mean,
what's that supposed to mean?

53:47.625 --> 53:50.259
- I think he was supposed
to look like a samurai.

53:50.261 --> 53:52.995
- Hidden meanings, kwasini.
- Right, yeah. Whatever, man.

53:52.997 --> 53:54.930
- And what about "the avengers"?

53:54.932 --> 53:57.399
Not one black guy in the group.

53:57.401 --> 54:00.169
- Nick fury is black.
- He wasn't in the comics.

54:00.171 --> 54:01.971
They made him black,

54:01.973 --> 54:04.573
so none of the black folks
could complain.

54:04.575 --> 54:07.409
They can't say, "hey,
there's no black heroes,"

54:07.411 --> 54:10.145
because the white people go,
"well, yeah, look.

54:10.147 --> 54:12.514
The leader's black,
so it's okay."

54:12.516 --> 54:16.218
I mean, look at "rocky."
You got this white guy,

54:16.220 --> 54:17.486
he's a workin' man...

54:17.488 --> 54:20.823
You know,
and here comes this black guy,

54:20.825 --> 54:23.859
dressed like George Washington,
and he's taking over...

54:23.861 --> 54:26.295
The cherished symbols
of white America.

54:26.297 --> 54:29.098
And rocky,
this white fucking loser,

54:29.100 --> 54:34.236
beats the black guy
and saves his image of America.

54:34.238 --> 54:35.704
White America at that.

54:35.706 --> 54:37.606
And look at "rocky III."
Now he's rich,

54:37.608 --> 54:40.709
he's the flashy one,
and here comes another
black guy.

54:40.711 --> 54:44.079
This one from the ghetto.
I mean, this guy's really angry.

54:44.081 --> 54:47.783
He's gonna fuck rocky's wife,
i know it. But no!

54:47.785 --> 54:51.720
The rich, flashy white guy
still beat the black guy.

54:51.722 --> 54:54.957
What about "gremlins"?
- Could you just give me
one second, please?

54:54.959 --> 54:56.191
Okay? My buddy is dead.

54:56.193 --> 54:58.694
I've been in a room
for fucking days!
- What?

54:58.696 --> 55:00.763
- And if I don't get
to the border,

55:00.765 --> 55:02.164
some asshole named
El gato enfermo

55:02.166 --> 55:04.867
is gonna kill me!
And what the fuck is that?!

55:04.869 --> 55:06.802
Ah!
- El gato?

55:06.804 --> 55:10.773
That's one pussy you don't want
after you, that's for sure.

55:10.775 --> 55:13.542
Lookit,
go down this road one mile.

55:13.544 --> 55:16.011
There's an office there.

55:16.013 --> 55:18.147
There's your phone.

55:18.149 --> 55:19.948
Out.

55:19.950 --> 55:22.284
- This is so fucked!

55:22.286 --> 55:24.386
Fuck!

55:27.157 --> 55:30.159
- Hey, man! Hey!

55:30.161 --> 55:33.028
If I took your brain
and put it in a gnat's asshole,

55:33.030 --> 55:35.931
it would look like a baby
in a cardboard box.

55:35.933 --> 55:38.734
Take some advice.

55:42.339 --> 55:46.075
Life should not be a journey
to the grave with the intention

55:46.077 --> 55:49.111
of arriving safely in an
attractive, well-preserved body,

55:49.113 --> 55:50.446
but rather to slide in sideways,

55:50.448 --> 55:52.715
whiskey in one hand,
pistol in another,

55:52.717 --> 55:55.617
boot up your worst enemy's ass,

55:55.619 --> 55:58.454
body thoroughly used up,
totally worn out,

55:58.456 --> 56:02.291
fucked up and screaming,
"whoo-hoo!

56:02.293 --> 56:05.260
What a ride, motherfucker."

56:05.262 --> 56:07.429
- What?!

56:12.402 --> 56:15.104
Oh, Jesus.

57:09.025 --> 57:10.192
Hello?
-<i> Hello?</i>

57:10.194 --> 57:11.960
- Hello?
-<i> Hello?</i>

57:11.962 --> 57:15.097
- Uh...<i> ¿donde esta inglés?</i>
Can you help me, please?

57:15.099 --> 57:18.634
Can you help me?
<i>- I don't know, can I help you?</i>

57:18.636 --> 57:21.737
- My name is Brady Baxter.
I-I'm stranded here.

57:21.739 --> 57:25.407
I need you to call the police.
<i> La policia.</i> Please.

57:25.409 --> 57:28.177
-<i> Where are you, sir?</i>
- Uh...

58:46.055 --> 58:47.189
- Wait.

58:47.191 --> 58:49.591
Okay, she will take a shower
first thing,

58:49.593 --> 58:51.860
and that's the only time
you can do it.

58:54.732 --> 58:58.700
Otherwise she has orders
to shoot you in the knee,

58:58.702 --> 59:01.637
and she will.
So just... wait.

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:22.484
Boy: <i> Hello?</i>

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:24.686
<i> I can't hear you.</i>

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.223
- Boy #2: <i> Who is this?</i>
<i>- I got it. Hang up.</i>

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:30.325
-<i> Hello, stinky pants.</i>

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:33.028
<i> See ya later, penis.</i>

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.752
- Fuck! Bitch! Fucking bitch.
Fuck.

01:00:56.754 --> 01:01:00.122
- Your boss won't come up
with the money.

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:06.028
I never finished that story
about why he's so unforgiving.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:08.130
That day
he saw his older brother

01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:11.133
<i> wrap his toe around the string</i>
<i> and pull the trigger</i>

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:14.569
<i> because he couldn't stand</i>
<i> the mental torture anymore.</i>

01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:16.638
<i> So little gato grabbed the .45</i>

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.074
<i> and shot his father</i>
<i> in the face.</i>

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:22.310
<i> It was that day,</i>
<i> that one decision,</i>

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:24.946
it made him who he was.

01:01:24.948 --> 01:01:27.749
<i> And ever since that day,</i>
<i> all of Mexico</i>

01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:32.254
has been scared to death
of El gato enfermo.

01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:36.391
And he's coming here.
He's coming here to kill you.

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:48.170
- Okay. Now's your chance.

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:53.942
Here's your chance, okay?

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:57.946
Just give me two minutes
to take the car.

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:00.916
I'm so sorry.

01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:04.152
I'm really sorry
about all of this.

01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:07.289
It wasn't supposed to be you.

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:22.304
- Fuck!

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.764
- Hello, Mr. Baxter.

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:51.166
- You're... him.

01:02:51.168 --> 01:02:54.736
I... I know who you are,
i know who you are.

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:57.305
-<i> Cállate.</i>

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:06.515
I understand you make movies.

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:10.552
I love American movies.

01:03:10.554 --> 01:03:13.021
Real cinema.

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:15.924
Paul Thomas Anderson...

01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:17.926
He's my favorite.

01:03:17.928 --> 01:03:20.028
You know him?

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:24.800
There is a fabric he weaves,

01:03:24.802 --> 01:03:27.869
it's... very dear to me.

01:03:27.871 --> 01:03:30.806
Very complex
and sometimes...

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:32.808
Fragile...

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:36.545
Father-son relationship.

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:40.115
John c. Reilly,

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:43.385
Philip Baker hall in "Sydney."

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:48.523
Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds
in "boogie nights."

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:50.892
"There will be blood."

01:03:51.727 --> 01:03:54.062
Daniel day Lewis.

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:58.400
And that fucking deaf kid.

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:13.782
All great things...

01:04:13.784 --> 01:04:16.351
Were done by boys...

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:19.921
...who just wanted
to impress dad.

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:23.859
All the tallest buildings,

01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:25.994
created by men...

01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:30.098
Trying to show their dad
their big dicks.

01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:34.603
I think if women
ran the world...

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:37.205
All the big structures...

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:40.775
Would not be giant buildings
in the sky,

01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:44.479
but lush, warm tunnels...

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:49.284
...buried deep in the ground.

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:53.121
That's amazing, no?

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:56.558
It's easy money,

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.727
preying on men who are guilty

01:04:58.729 --> 01:05:02.364
of not raising their sons.

01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:05.200
Millions of ignored sons...

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:07.636
Raised by nannies.

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:13.308
I have kidnapped now, well...

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:16.678
...maybe over 50 American
young men.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:20.315
All whose fathers had money.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:24.486
These guys were too busy

01:05:24.488 --> 01:05:27.322
fucking secretaries.

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:29.658
Building wine cellars

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:34.195
and looking at the "robb report"
to play catch with their sons.

01:05:34.197 --> 01:05:37.832
So when they see the biggest
mistakes in their life

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:41.670
smack them in the face,
they don't hesitate to...

01:05:41.672 --> 01:05:43.605
- That's not me.

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:45.607
Your girls screwed up.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.008
I'm an orphan.

01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:49.945
But I told them...

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:51.813
Call my boss.

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:56.217
Right? Call my boss.
He's got money, he'll pay you.

01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:58.119
- I spoke to him.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:02.857
Mega-producer sy ginsburg.

01:06:02.859 --> 01:06:05.193
He told me that...

01:06:05.195 --> 01:06:07.796
I could go fuck myself.

01:06:07.798 --> 01:06:13.168
And that he was having
a hard time understanding me.

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:19.240
I asked him:
"Do you speak <i> español?"</i>

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:23.078
He said the only thing
he needed to say in Spanish was,

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.780
"put the leaves over there."

01:06:25.782 --> 01:06:29.317
- What kind of person are you?

01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:50.238
- Since I was very small...

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:55.243
I punish the bad guys.

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:59.781
If I punish the bad guys,

01:06:59.783 --> 01:07:04.319
then I am the good guy, no?

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:10.425
Such a big heart.

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:13.595
And talented.

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:19.768
Shame to see it go to waste.

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:24.773
Look at me.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.448
Excuse me.

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:41.389
Yes, hello?

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.958
I'm actually in the middle
of something.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.361
So can you call me back?

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:50.131
Yes, please.

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:57.138
My grandson.

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.973
He's in preschool.

01:07:58.975 --> 01:08:02.143
He stabbed someone again.

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:08.716
So could you please excuse me?

01:08:08.718 --> 01:08:10.652
- Sure.

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:31.171
- I love American movies.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:58.332
- Where'd <i> El jefe</i> go?

01:08:58.335 --> 01:09:01.236
- He got a phone call.
His grandson.

01:09:01.238 --> 01:09:04.272
- If it's his third grandson,
he's not coming back.

01:09:04.274 --> 01:09:07.942
I guess I'm gonna be
the last person you ever see.

01:09:07.944 --> 01:09:12.881
You know, I hear that men
after death stay hard for hours.

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.350
You think that's true?

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:18.419
- I've got something hard
for you.

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:20.654
- Whoa. I'm sorry, Brady,
I'm sorry.

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:24.259
Brady, look, I'm sorry.
It was just for the money.

01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:27.127
You've gotta understand.
Katie really, really likes you.

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:30.430
It's all gonna be fine.
- Don't!

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:37.572
- That wasn't supposed
to be... loaded.

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.836
- Hello?

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:10.305
- What? Brady?

01:10:10.307 --> 01:10:13.675
- Tommy!
You're okay, you're alive!

01:10:13.677 --> 01:10:15.510
- Of course I'm a-fuckin-live!

01:10:15.512 --> 01:10:18.246
It was a joke, dude!
The whole fuckin' thing!

01:10:18.248 --> 01:10:21.182
<i>Well, except for the, you know,</i>
<i> the mushrooms and the bar.</i>

01:10:21.184 --> 01:10:22.850
<i> That was real.</i>

01:10:22.852 --> 01:10:24.652
<i> How about the fuckin' cowboy</i>
<i> tea-bagging that tranny?</i>

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:27.355
<i> "It's only fucking weird</i>
<i> if you make it weird."</i>

01:10:27.357 --> 01:10:29.657
It was a setup!
The girls, I paid them.

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:31.292
<i> It was a birthday prank!</i>

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:33.194
<i> That's why they never</i>
<i> really hurt you.</i>

01:10:33.196 --> 01:10:34.796
<i> And those shots</i>
<i> were fucking thorazine!</i>

01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:37.665
<i> Did Lucia crack and tell you</i>
<i> about the whole thing?</i>

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:40.101
<i> Is she there?</i>
<i> Let me talk to her.</i>

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:48.643
Yo. Hello?

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.752
- Holy shit.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:01.055
Holy shit,
what the fuck did you do?

01:11:01.057 --> 01:11:03.224
- What did I do?

01:11:03.226 --> 01:11:05.159
What did you do?

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:06.861
Tommy, do you have any idea
what you put me through?

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:09.430
- Th-this was a prank, dude.
All of it.

01:11:09.432 --> 01:11:11.666
This girl's a fucking actress!

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:14.802
This wasn't supposed to happen!
Ah!

01:11:14.804 --> 01:11:17.272
- A prank, Tommy?!

01:11:17.274 --> 01:11:19.240
Is this your idea
of a birthday present?!

01:11:19.242 --> 01:11:21.376
A prank where I end up
killing a girl?!

01:11:21.378 --> 01:11:22.910
- No, no! The fucking ending

01:11:22.912 --> 01:11:24.312
is supposed to be Katie
coming through the door

01:11:24.314 --> 01:11:26.481
with a fucking birthday cake,
dude!

01:11:26.483 --> 01:11:28.850
I was planning this
for fucking months!

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:32.854
That gun wasn't supposed
to be fucking loaded!

01:11:32.856 --> 01:11:35.556
Oh, fuck! Shit!
That's the chicken gun

01:11:35.558 --> 01:11:38.893
that had the fuckin'
bullets in it.
- Oh, my god.

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:41.396
- I was trying
to fucking show you
i could tell a great story

01:11:41.398 --> 01:11:43.264
so you can get me a meeting
with your boss.

01:11:43.266 --> 01:11:47.201
- You could've just sent me
a script, Tommy!

01:11:47.203 --> 01:11:49.470
Oh, fuck. We're so fucked.

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:52.907
- Wait, wait. We?
What do you mean, we, man?

01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:54.842
You fuckin' shot her.

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:59.113
- What did you just say?
- What?

01:11:59.115 --> 01:12:02.517
You fuckin' shot her, man.
The prank was up.

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:05.520
She was untying you
when El gato left.

01:12:05.522 --> 01:12:06.954
- This is your fault.
This is your fault.

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:09.123
This is your fault!
- All right!

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:10.992
- I thought you were dead!
- Okay! It's my fault, too.

01:12:10.994 --> 01:12:15.663
I'm sorry.
Just please stop
hitting me. Just calm down.

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:18.800
- Don't tell me to calm down!
I just fucking killed
a girl because of you!

01:12:18.802 --> 01:12:22.837
- At least we're not
in the fucking states. Right?

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:24.906
Um...

01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:29.143
Fuck, what about that,
the cowboy?

01:12:29.145 --> 01:12:30.712
Texican?

01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:32.880
You know, we can call him.
Maybe he can help us.

01:12:32.882 --> 01:12:35.583
- He works for the government.
- He's fucking Mexican, okay?!

01:12:35.585 --> 01:12:37.885
They all do dirty shit
for money!

01:12:37.887 --> 01:12:40.722
Just listen, I have a plan.
It's simple, all right?

01:12:40.724 --> 01:12:43.524
We don't tell him
this was a prank
gone wrong, right?

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.059
We tell him
exactly as it happened.

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:48.529
They kidnapped us,
they tortured us.

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:51.933
I... went to the fucking
hospital or something, okay?

01:12:51.935 --> 01:12:54.569
You've been here
for three fucking days.

01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:56.804
Sell this shit, okay?
You can act.

01:12:56.806 --> 01:13:00.408
You're always saying
it's fucking easy, so act.

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:03.811
You're fucking filthy.
Take a shower, okay?

01:13:03.813 --> 01:13:06.447
I'll come up with a story.

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:12.987
- Make sure you work out
the ending this time.

01:13:40.682 --> 01:13:45.486
- Mr. Brady,
you fucked up good, huh?

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:48.656
- It's these girls.
They... they...

01:13:48.658 --> 01:13:51.292
They fucking tortured me.
I had no choice.

01:13:51.294 --> 01:13:53.561
- Tortured you? With what?

01:13:55.664 --> 01:14:00.668
- With thumbtacks and needles
and fucking music.

01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:05.206
- Music?
-<i> Es</i> creed, huh? Nickelback?

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:07.241
- They drugged us, okay?
Tommy, tell them.

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:09.911
They drugged us both.
- They did. I had a reaction.

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:12.980
It was a bad fuckin' scene.
Can you help us or not?

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:16.217
- Gentlemen, listen,
this is all good and fun...

01:14:16.219 --> 01:14:18.252
But you have no physical scars.

01:14:18.254 --> 01:14:19.854
No marks of torture.

01:14:19.856 --> 01:14:22.156
Your trip to the hospital,
Mr. Tommy,

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:26.027
that could be the four of you
havin' fun with drugs.

01:14:26.029 --> 01:14:28.496
This right here...

01:14:28.498 --> 01:14:31.165
This right here is not good.

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:34.035
- What'd I tell you?
Why did we call him?

01:14:34.037 --> 01:14:37.905
- Well, now, wait a minute,
Mr. Brady. I can still help you.

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:39.874
I'm a man...

01:14:39.876 --> 01:14:42.844
Who knows many people
and places.

01:14:42.846 --> 01:14:47.415
Ain't that right, caballo?
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:47.417 --> 01:14:50.184
- There's only one problem.

01:14:50.186 --> 01:14:52.086
- What's that?

01:14:52.088 --> 01:14:56.390
- Sooner or later, that other
girl's gonna come back.

01:14:56.392 --> 01:14:59.093
What do you plan on doing?

01:14:59.095 --> 01:15:01.295
Her friend...

01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:03.064
Is dead.

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:07.902
- It's always the friend,
<i> hombres.</i> Always.

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:10.938
You find that one girl...

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:14.141
But it's her friend
who cockblocks you.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.812
- All right, I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

01:15:17.814 --> 01:15:20.481
I'm just gonna wait here, right?
And when she comes back,

01:15:20.483 --> 01:15:22.216
I'm gonna talk to her
rationally.

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:23.584
- You're gonna talk to her?

01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:25.152
You're gonna charm this girl
into forgetting

01:15:25.154 --> 01:15:26.954
you just killed
her fucking friend?

01:15:26.956 --> 01:15:29.590
- It was in self-defense.
- Ever hear of Mexican karate?

01:15:29.592 --> 01:15:31.792
- No.

01:15:31.794 --> 01:15:36.130
- Well, there ain't no such
thing as self-defense in this
motherfuckin' country.

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:38.432
- Then I'm gonna get out
of this country. She
doesn't know who I am.

01:15:38.434 --> 01:15:42.203
- Bullshit, dude.
She doesn't know your full name,

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:44.705
but she knows who you work for,
and using Facebook,

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:46.741
it's not gonna be hard
to fuckin' find you.

01:15:46.743 --> 01:15:48.809
- If you hadn't decided
to Michael Douglas me,

01:15:48.811 --> 01:15:50.611
none of this would've happened.
- Hey, hey!

01:15:50.613 --> 01:15:52.146
This is what we're gonna do.

01:15:52.148 --> 01:15:54.081
Well, what you boys
are gonna do.

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:55.816
You're gonna clean up
that blood,

01:15:55.818 --> 01:15:58.286
you're gonna put the girl
in the blankets,

01:15:58.288 --> 01:16:00.288
take her out to my pickup.

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:01.822
Fortunately, in this hotel,

01:16:01.824 --> 01:16:06.260
someone carrying out a body
in sheets... is normal.

01:16:11.266 --> 01:16:13.234
Good shit, boys.

01:16:19.609 --> 01:16:23.144
- Yeah, I love this song!
What...

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:28.616
- Hi.

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:40.261
I'm not gonna tell anybody!

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:42.830
Tommy! Brady!

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:47.034
- My beaner brethren would kill

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:50.838
to see this fuckin'
role-reversal, huh?

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:56.777
- I'm sorry, man.

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:58.713
I can't believe this.

01:16:58.715 --> 01:17:00.881
I had it planned perfectly.

01:17:00.883 --> 01:17:02.950
As Lucia was coming out
of the shower,

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:05.052
she was gonna tell you
about the prank.

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:08.422
She was even planning
on you kicking her ass, y'know?

01:17:08.424 --> 01:17:10.057
She's good like that.

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:12.259
It's the gun.
The fucking gun.

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:14.829
It was not supposed
to be loaded.

01:17:14.831 --> 01:17:18.799
It was the chicken gun
that fuckin' Katie used.

01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:22.303
Just don't worry about it,
okay? It'll work out.

01:17:22.305 --> 01:17:24.705
- Thanks. That's really,
really assuring, man.

01:17:24.707 --> 01:17:28.309
Because I only
just fucking killed a girl!

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:35.516
What the fuck is that?

01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:37.585
- Well, guys,

01:17:37.587 --> 01:17:40.221
that is the rocket.

01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:50.631
- This is so fucked up.

01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:53.067
This is so fucked up.

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:02.243
What the hell is this?
What the fuck is this?

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:15.356
- What the fuck's the goat for?
- What is this?

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:17.825
- Texican, tell us
what the fuck's going on?

01:18:17.827 --> 01:18:19.927
- What the hell is this, man?

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:40.214
-<i> Es bueno,</i> boss.

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:42.783
- What the hell you gonna do?
Slingshot her over the wall?!

01:18:42.785 --> 01:18:45.953
-<i> Sí.</i>
- Are you fuckin' crazy?

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:48.255
- Your gringo friend here

01:18:48.257 --> 01:18:50.424
is the one who shot
that <i> puto</i> whore, huh?

01:18:50.426 --> 01:18:54.929
So don't get mad at me!
- Okay, enough of your shit.

01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:56.997
- Look, we leave this girl here,

01:18:56.999 --> 01:19:00.668
the vultures are liable
to get her.

01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:02.169
But this area is patrolled.

01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:04.438
So if the federales
find this girl,

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.575
there's a slight chance
it could get back to you.

01:19:07.577 --> 01:19:10.711
Mexicans care more
about a dead American girl

01:19:10.713 --> 01:19:15.449
than the Americans give a shit
about a dead Mexican girl.

01:19:15.451 --> 01:19:17.785
So we shoot her over the fence,

01:19:17.787 --> 01:19:22.089
U.S. border patrol finds her,
they think another dead beaner.

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:25.726
They don't give a shit.
It's a good plan.

01:19:25.728 --> 01:19:28.028
- That's a fucking good plan?

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:30.164
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:19:33.034 --> 01:19:35.536
We gonna say something at least,
first?

01:19:35.538 --> 01:19:38.506
- Have at it, boys.

01:19:38.508 --> 01:19:40.708
- It's okay, all right...

01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:43.010
I'll say something.

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:48.082
Lord, uh...

01:19:48.084 --> 01:19:50.718
Forgive this girl for

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:53.220
the path she chose.

01:19:53.222 --> 01:19:57.024
Forgive her for
the line of work she got into,

01:19:57.026 --> 01:20:01.195
and for what she did
to Brady and myself.

01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:04.331
But, you know,

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:07.802
uh, deep down, um,

01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:09.970
you know, fuck her, man.

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.105
- Hey, man!

01:20:11.107 --> 01:20:14.942
What are we gonna do about
Katie?

01:20:14.944 --> 01:20:16.811
- What about her?
- What about her?

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:19.513
She's in the back
of a fucking truck.

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:21.348
We're gonna let her go, right?

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:23.584
- Well... unfortunately,

01:20:23.586 --> 01:20:26.287
sometimes with jobs,

01:20:26.289 --> 01:20:28.189
there's gonna be
collateral damage.

01:20:28.191 --> 01:20:31.058
Now, this girl, she knows
everything about you guys.

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:34.562
- Wha...?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Brady.

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:38.699
But you,

01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:41.535
you're gonna
have to kill her too.

01:20:41.537 --> 01:20:43.137
- No.

01:20:43.139 --> 01:20:46.240
No. Fuck you. No.

01:20:46.242 --> 01:20:49.677
Katie, listen to me.
They wanna kill you.

01:20:49.679 --> 01:20:52.112
- No!
- I don't have a choice.

01:20:52.114 --> 01:20:54.782
But I know that you know
that this was an accident.

01:20:54.784 --> 01:20:56.483
I didn't want
any of this to happen!

01:20:56.485 --> 01:20:59.753
And I'm sorry, okay?
I'm so fucking sorry.

01:20:59.755 --> 01:21:03.624
- Brady? Brady, I promise...
I don't care about Lucia, okay?

01:21:03.626 --> 01:21:07.161
Tommy paid us
and everything went wrong!
- Yeah.

01:21:07.163 --> 01:21:08.429
- I know
you didn't wanna shoot her!

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:11.198
- Fuck!

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:14.768
I'm sorry!
- What the fuck?!

01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:16.637
- I'm sorry, okay?!
I'm sorry, dude!

01:21:16.639 --> 01:21:18.072
I couldn't fucking chance it!

01:21:18.074 --> 01:21:19.907
It's all my fault
and I couldn't!

01:21:19.909 --> 01:21:22.877
I couldn't chance it, dude!
- What's the matter with you?!

01:21:22.879 --> 01:21:24.778
- Now we're even!
- She was innocent!

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:26.146
She was part of your prank!

01:21:26.148 --> 01:21:28.282
- You shot a girl too!
- Oh, my god!

01:21:28.284 --> 01:21:30.451
- I couldn't live with the fact
this was all my fucking fault!

01:21:30.453 --> 01:21:33.320
- Jesus, Tommy! Fuck!
- Now we're even!

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:36.557
Even conscience, okay?
I'm sorry.

01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:39.994
I wanted you to have a birthday
to remember, man.

01:21:39.996 --> 01:21:42.630
Just not like this.

01:21:58.613 --> 01:22:00.648
- I'm so sorry.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:05.486
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:10.324
I'm so sorry.

01:22:11.526 --> 01:22:14.528
Oh, jeez.

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:19.667
Tommy!

01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:23.537
Tommy! Guys! Tommy! Guys!

01:22:23.539 --> 01:22:26.373
I'm so sorry.
- Oh, god, please.

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:29.076
- I didn't want
any of this to happen.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:33.113
Jeez.
- Oh, god.

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:35.215
You're just a fucking soulless
movie producer.

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:37.584
- Tommy!
- Oh, god, please.

01:22:37.586 --> 01:22:39.353
- Oh, god, I'm sorry.

01:22:39.355 --> 01:22:42.456
- You know what?
I have one last question.

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:44.758
- Ever seen one of these?

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.760
- Jesus Christ!

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:02.643
- Happy birthday, buddy!

01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:04.378
Ha-ha! Oh, come on!

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:07.648
You couldn't figure it out?

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:10.517
They really did anything to you.
Think about it.

01:23:10.519 --> 01:23:13.454
<i> The needle in the toe.</i>
<i> I mean, the phone rings,</i>

01:23:13.456 --> 01:23:16.590
<i> and then the fake news footage</i>
<i> and El gato enfermo.</i>

01:23:16.592 --> 01:23:18.559
That guy's a fucking famous
Mexican soap actor.

01:23:18.561 --> 01:23:20.928
- This was a prank, Tommy?
All of it?

01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:25.032
Lucia? You, too? Jesus!

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:27.835
You set this all up?!

01:23:27.837 --> 01:23:29.937
- Funny you should ask,

01:23:29.939 --> 01:23:32.406
'cause I've got the most amazing
fucking story you've ever heard.

01:23:32.408 --> 01:23:34.341
<i> "Batshit," tale to</i>
<i> the heart of darkness,</i>

01:23:41.317 --> 01:23:44.251
- Um... no, uh...

01:23:44.253 --> 01:23:47.121
That-- that was real,
unfortunately.

01:23:47.123 --> 01:23:49.656
But the rest, yes!

<i> "I love movies.</i>

Do you think
if women ruled the world,

01:23:53.162 --> 01:23:56.063
the big buildings
would be tunnels in the ground?"

01:23:56.065 --> 01:23:57.698
Happy birthday.

01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:01.135
Come on, it was fucking
brilliant.

01:24:01.137 --> 01:24:03.237
Brilliant.

01:24:24.093 --> 01:24:26.627
- Okay, gringo,

01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:28.328
that is a wrap.

01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:32.166
- Yes, it is.

Are you shitting me with this?

01:24:37.506 --> 01:24:39.740
- Thank you guys so much.
- That was a good one.

01:24:39.742 --> 01:24:42.342
- You guys were great.
- It was a hefty bill.

01:24:42.344 --> 01:24:44.278
We convincing enough for ya?

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:47.181
- I'd say. You had your balls
in a tranny's mouth.

01:24:49.085 --> 01:24:51.318
- All-inclusive.

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:01.795
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:25:04.532 --> 01:25:06.667
So this is it.

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:11.238
- I'd be crazy to see you again.

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:15.109
You know that, right?

01:25:15.111 --> 01:25:17.177
- Yeah.

01:25:25.521 --> 01:25:28.655
- But I will.

01:25:28.657 --> 01:25:31.558
- Oh, my god,
that's so awkward.

01:25:34.195 --> 01:25:36.530
- Happy birthday.

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:52.379
- Okay, boys, rock'n'roll.

01:25:54.415 --> 01:25:56.583
- Gotta hand it to you, man.

01:25:56.585 --> 01:26:00.420
This is the most fucked-up,
brilliant birthday present

01:26:00.422 --> 01:26:02.556
I've ever gotten.

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:06.894

- He was eating his <i> gato.</i>

01:26:36.725 --> 01:26:38.025
- What?

01:26:38.027 --> 01:26:40.928
- I love you.

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.264
- Cut.

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:48.669
- Is there, like,
any chance I'm there?

01:26:48.671 --> 01:26:51.338
- It's a little...
- There you go.

01:26:52.942 --> 01:26:54.675
- His hat!

01:26:54.677 --> 01:26:57.344
Oh, my god.

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:04.918
- Ooh... boy bands.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.521
One direction.

01:27:07.523 --> 01:27:09.890
I'd fuck that one guy.

01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:20.968
-<i> Ay caramba.</i>

01:27:23.371 --> 01:27:25.372
- Okay, well,
it's not just your party,

01:27:25.374 --> 01:27:26.840
it's your birthday,
but shit, fuck.

01:27:26.842 --> 01:27:30.210
We wanna all hang out
and have a good time too.

01:27:30.212 --> 01:27:31.712
Fuckin' motherfucker.

01:27:33.916 --> 01:27:37.718
- Well, this is the end,
corsini. No. Kwasini.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.954
Cro-croissant.
This is the end, croissant.

01:27:40.956 --> 01:27:45.125
<i> L'addition, s'il vous plaît!</i>
All right, here we go.

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:10.517
- So, man, what you been up to?
You still writin' songs?

01:28:10.519 --> 01:28:12.586
- Uh, well, no, actually.

01:28:12.588 --> 01:28:15.756
You see, all the great songs
have already been written

01:28:15.758 --> 01:28:18.392
by guys with wigs and stuff.

01:28:18.394 --> 01:28:20.594
- So what brings you
to mexicali?

01:28:20.596 --> 01:28:22.663
You just tryin' to get away?

01:28:22.665 --> 01:28:26.700
- We're actually talkin' about
movin' back to Montana soon.

01:28:26.702 --> 01:28:31.538
Gonna be a dental-floss tycoon.
Right, man?
