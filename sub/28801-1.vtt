02:09.026 --> 02:12.431
You expect me to
believe one man done this?

02:14.967 --> 02:15.835
One man?

02:17.770 --> 02:21.274
One unarmed man did all this?

02:23.675 --> 02:24.543
It's what we're told.

02:26.544 --> 02:27.679
By who, exactly?

03:00.045 --> 03:01.246
What happened here?

03:03.481 --> 03:04.850
He was waiting for 'em.

03:06.485 --> 03:07.984
And he started asking questions.

03:07.986 --> 03:10.586
What about?

03:10.588 --> 03:12.224
About you.

03:13.558 --> 03:14.561
What about me?

03:15.662 --> 03:18.529
I don't know, but
they started arguing.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.399
What happened?

03:21.567 --> 03:22.735
All hell broke loose.

03:39.518 --> 03:41.484
Keep working, you.

03:41.486 --> 03:44.257
We gotta get this
railroad built.

04:12.050 --> 04:13.885
I know
it's not much, but.

04:15.554 --> 04:16.622
It's perfect.

04:23.396 --> 04:24.264
You're perfect.

04:25.964 --> 04:28.634
And one day we'll
have land of our own

04:29.769 --> 04:30.970
and a house for everyone.

04:32.704 --> 04:34.339
I'm happy where we are, Jing.

04:36.007 --> 04:36.875
I know, but.

04:39.812 --> 04:41.547
I don't need much.

04:43.581 --> 04:44.850
I just need you.

04:48.620 --> 04:53.625
I just need us.

05:03.836 --> 05:04.704
Forever.

05:06.172 --> 05:07.040
Forever.

06:56.314 --> 06:57.149
Pick it up.

07:12.031 --> 07:12.865
Pick it up.

07:19.004 --> 07:21.941
You either pick it up
or I shoot you dead.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.117
Pick it up.

07:33.351 --> 07:34.219
Pick it up.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.637
I'm sorry.

07:58.377 --> 08:00.012
You just drew on a law man.

08:22.634 --> 08:23.800
Get up boy.

08:33.812 --> 08:35.778
You have got to be
out of your mind.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.082
Get away from my bars.

08:39.317 --> 08:40.885
I didn't do anything wrong.

08:44.956 --> 08:47.592
Well that's a matter of
perspective now, isn't it?

08:48.693 --> 08:50.295
Once the marshal
gets back into town,

08:51.397 --> 08:52.929
he'll decide what to do with ya.

08:52.931 --> 08:54.196
When the marshal
gets back into town,

08:54.198 --> 08:55.734
he'll see that I'm innocent.

08:57.235 --> 09:01.106
You are many things,
but innocent is not one of them, boy.

09:03.676 --> 09:06.810
Jesus Christ, he really does
smell like a fuckin' animal.

09:06.812 --> 09:09.315
You might wanna sick
the hose on him, Frank.

09:16.955 --> 09:18.220
Ask me where I'm headed.

09:18.222 --> 09:19.690
Where you headed to, Deputy?

09:19.692 --> 09:21.291
Well, I'm glad
you asked, you see

09:21.293 --> 09:23.696
I got a date with a lady friend,

09:25.063 --> 09:28.864
and I think our Mr. Chinaman
knows exactly who she is,

09:28.866 --> 09:31.836
in fact, I know you
know who she is.

09:34.239 --> 09:36.406
Now you have got to be
out of your goddamn mind,

09:36.408 --> 09:38.978
I will paint these
walls with your brains.

09:45.049 --> 09:47.249
I'm the one you
got a problem with.

09:47.251 --> 09:48.120
Leave her be.

09:49.254 --> 09:50.122
Problem?

09:58.764 --> 10:00.863
I don't have a problem with you.

10:00.865 --> 10:03.266
I see you as nothing,
except for something

10:03.268 --> 10:06.737
maybe that exists in between
the dirt and the roaches,

10:06.739 --> 10:08.908
but nothing of
importance in my world.

10:10.808 --> 10:14.744
Your woman, however, I do
have a problem with her.

10:14.746 --> 10:18.381
You see, I have yellow
fever, and I'm hoping

10:18.383 --> 10:19.619
that she's the cure.

11:28.553 --> 11:31.021
I'm terribly sorry
to disturb you

11:31.023 --> 11:34.125
at such an ungodly hour, Miss...

11:37.596 --> 11:39.230
Phang, Miss Phang.

11:40.365 --> 11:41.466
Is everything okay?

11:44.235 --> 11:47.436
I'm not gonna lie to you,
this is about your husband.

11:47.438 --> 11:49.841
I'm afraid he's in a
whole lot of trouble.

11:51.442 --> 11:56.081
But I assure you, I am here
to help you, in any way I can.

12:01.419 --> 12:02.288
Where is he?

12:04.155 --> 12:06.488
There was an incident at town.

12:06.490 --> 12:08.224
I saw it, it
wasn't Jing's fault.

12:08.226 --> 12:10.526
Now now, I'm not
here to discuss the law

12:10.528 --> 12:12.798
or who did or
didn't do something.

12:14.166 --> 12:18.304
I'm just here to help you, you
and your husband, to do this,

12:20.371 --> 12:21.372
peaceful-like.

12:28.547 --> 12:29.481
Hey Frank.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.455
Now son, I been
patient, I have been kind,

12:39.457 --> 12:41.424
but you have done
burned my patience

12:41.426 --> 12:44.326
down to the fuckin' ground.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.563
You yellow-skinned
piece of shit,

12:46.565 --> 12:48.934
keep your hands off of the...

13:57.601 --> 13:58.571
Where's Jing?

14:06.445 --> 14:10.216
You said he was, I need
to go find my husband.

14:11.682 --> 14:15.888
I believe you
misunderstood my intentions.

14:32.703 --> 14:35.537
I'm sorry for the confusion.

14:35.539 --> 14:38.343
Your husband is
obviously not here.

14:40.479 --> 14:43.046
I brought you here
for personal reasons.

14:43.048 --> 14:47.620
Now, I can help reunite you
with him, and I'd like to.

14:49.553 --> 14:52.323
But you're gonna have to do
a little something for me.

14:54.058 --> 14:56.160
To get a little you
gotta give a little.

14:59.464 --> 15:01.500
Now would you like to
go see your husband?

15:07.706 --> 15:08.908
Take my hand.

15:15.813 --> 15:16.682
Oh.

15:18.115 --> 15:19.918
This place brings back memories.

15:22.053 --> 15:26.125
See, when I was little,
this place used to be

15:28.225 --> 15:29.394
a slaughterhouse.

15:31.429 --> 15:35.600
Still actually see the
blood stains of the animals.

15:37.701 --> 15:38.570
Nope.

15:42.474 --> 15:45.208
It's gonna be over
real soon, okay?

15:45.210 --> 15:47.079
And then you'll
see your husband.

15:50.548 --> 15:53.682
You'll see him real
soon, just be...

16:04.729 --> 16:05.597
It's okay.

16:07.532 --> 16:08.533
That's okay.

16:11.735 --> 16:12.604
Shh.

16:14.105 --> 16:14.974
Shh.

16:20.144 --> 16:21.145
That's okay.

17:01.785 --> 17:02.653
Woo!

17:08.358 --> 17:09.227
Hey now.

17:31.782 --> 17:32.650
Oh fuck.

17:41.792 --> 17:42.660
Fuck.

17:48.232 --> 17:49.100
Oh fuck.

18:29.473 --> 18:30.608
Oh no no no.

18:32.544 --> 18:33.412
Oh no.

18:52.998 --> 18:53.865
Oh no.

18:57.535 --> 18:58.403
No.

19:25.663 --> 19:26.531
Hey!

19:27.565 --> 19:28.567
I need help!

19:32.604 --> 19:33.969
Hey!

19:33.971 --> 19:34.839
Hey!

19:39.009 --> 19:39.877
Hey!

19:45.416 --> 19:50.422
Hey!

20:37.801 --> 20:39.469
Hey.

20:39.471 --> 20:41.371
Don't turn your back on me.

20:41.373 --> 20:42.374
All I need is a name.

20:49.012 --> 20:50.014
Chink.

20:51.148 --> 20:53.017
You better get going
where you came from.

21:06.964 --> 21:08.930
I just need his name.

21:53.678 --> 21:55.745
I just need his name.

21:55.747 --> 21:57.316
You can kill me.

21:58.115 --> 22:00.519
What do you think I'm go do?

22:25.042 --> 22:26.610
He gave him what he wanted.

22:29.646 --> 22:31.780
What are you talkin' about?

22:31.782 --> 22:33.484
Said you'd be lookin' for him.

22:36.054 --> 22:38.557
Said to give this
to Marshal Walker.

23:02.313 --> 23:03.548
Get some men together.

23:06.084 --> 23:07.719
And get me a tracker.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.622
What is it, Danny?

23:13.758 --> 23:14.692
Jake Sanders.

23:16.693 --> 23:17.561
What about him?

23:18.262 --> 23:20.062
Jake was our tracker.

23:20.064 --> 23:21.600
Then find me another one!

23:22.666 --> 23:23.534
Get!

23:29.807 --> 23:33.412
Make sure that they
get a fittin' burial.

23:37.214 --> 23:38.649
What a damn mess.

23:43.654 --> 23:44.522
Jesus.

24:24.295 --> 24:25.230
He hadn't paid.

24:27.731 --> 24:29.733
Stick it on his
tab, he's good for it.

24:48.318 --> 24:49.185
Get up!

25:00.964 --> 25:02.297
You gentlemen have
me at a disadvantage,

25:02.299 --> 25:07.672
you seem to know who I am,
I don't know who you are.

25:10.340 --> 25:11.575
Got a job for you.

25:15.913 --> 25:16.644
I'm retired.

25:16.646 --> 25:17.948
Not today you're not.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.926
So I'm guessing I
have little choice.

25:30.928 --> 25:31.997
No you do not.

25:36.334 --> 25:37.967
Who's hirin'?

25:37.969 --> 25:39.701
Marshal Walker.

25:40.771 --> 25:41.705
What's the job?

25:43.106 --> 25:44.209
It's any easy one.

25:45.175 --> 25:47.011
Need you to track one man.

25:50.914 --> 25:53.082
It's easy, huh?

25:53.084 --> 25:54.885
Then why you need me?

25:56.921 --> 25:58.590
We need this done quickly.

25:59.723 --> 26:01.326
One thing I learned
about trackin' men.

26:02.693 --> 26:04.693
It's never easy and you
damn sure never rush it.

26:04.695 --> 26:07.063
Well now, that's two things.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.268
That one's a keeper.

26:12.836 --> 26:14.105
Where are my damn britches?

26:16.039 --> 26:17.075
Oh, shit.

26:26.851 --> 26:28.883
We'll be outside waitin'.

26:28.885 --> 26:30.719
Come on, Danny.

26:30.721 --> 26:32.891
The other riders'll
meet ya in the mornin'.

27:09.093 --> 27:09.961
Marshal.

27:10.894 --> 27:11.762
Oriel.

27:26.844 --> 27:28.647
That should cover it.

27:32.182 --> 27:34.919
I'll take real
good care of 'em.

27:37.521 --> 27:39.223
Just get 'em
out of the street.

27:40.423 --> 27:42.257
Folks don't need to see this.

27:42.259 --> 27:43.161
Right, right.

28:17.394 --> 28:21.098
You stick to my boy like
flies on shit till this is done.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.232
He takes a piss,
you hold it for him,

28:24.234 --> 28:26.568
he takes a shit, you wipe him.

28:26.570 --> 28:28.105
But you keep him safe.

28:30.974 --> 28:34.242
Although Frank would
very much enjoy that,

28:34.244 --> 28:38.247
I'm quite capable of
taking care of myself.

28:38.249 --> 28:43.254
Which begs the question, why
am I not going with them?

28:53.196 --> 28:54.431
Give us a minute, Frank.

28:58.536 --> 29:03.508
Because being your father,
it's my job

29:04.275 --> 29:05.844
to protect you, James.

29:07.478 --> 29:08.513
Read this.

29:17.255 --> 29:21.155
Now you know why you can't go
and why we need to end this,

29:21.157 --> 29:23.258
be done with it.

29:23.260 --> 29:25.160
Let me clean up my own mess.

29:25.162 --> 29:28.098
Best you remember who made
this mess in the first place.

29:29.232 --> 29:32.401
Makes me sick thinking
about what you done.

29:32.403 --> 29:34.204
Don't take your
eyes off me, boy.

29:38.276 --> 29:41.446
Best we get this dealt with
quick and let people forget

29:42.445 --> 29:45.613
about the Chinaman and his wife.

29:45.615 --> 29:46.481
They're not gonna...

29:46.483 --> 29:47.351
Hey.

29:49.053 --> 29:50.585
You're my son and
I love you, James,

29:50.587 --> 29:55.159
but this is the last
time, the last damn time.

30:00.564 --> 30:03.368
I made your mother a
promise, God rest her soul,

30:05.269 --> 30:07.438
that I'd keep you outta trouble.

30:12.410 --> 30:14.512
Trouble just seems to
find you, don't it?

30:16.380 --> 30:19.250
And right now I'm going
to pray for forgiveness,

30:20.451 --> 30:21.952
and you oughta go with me.

30:29.093 --> 30:31.496
God turned his back
on us a long time ago.

30:33.663 --> 30:34.566
You old fool.

33:07.250 --> 33:08.118
Lord,

33:11.588 --> 33:12.723
as far as the boy,

33:15.392 --> 33:18.028
I've tried hard to forgive him.

33:22.133 --> 33:25.767
But there's just no good in him.

33:25.769 --> 33:26.636
Never has been.

33:29.140 --> 33:33.542
But damn me, I made a promise
to his mother on her deathbed

33:33.544 --> 33:36.314
that I'd see to it that
no harm would come to him,

33:37.213 --> 33:38.582
even though I know it should.

33:40.451 --> 33:41.786
Forgive me for that.

33:45.288 --> 33:46.557
Please forgive me for that.

34:14.318 --> 34:15.186
Whoa.

34:19.722 --> 34:21.289
You see anything?

34:21.291 --> 34:22.556
Yeah.

34:22.559 --> 34:23.925
The town.

34:23.927 --> 34:27.795
You know Senor, we're gettin'
real tired of your jokes.

34:27.797 --> 34:29.632
I just buried four of my men.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.833
We paid for results.

34:32.835 --> 34:34.101
Paid.

34:34.103 --> 34:36.438
First of all, nobody spoke
to me about any money.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.574
Second of all, this guy
killed four of your men.

34:38.576 --> 34:39.675
He did.

34:39.677 --> 34:40.545
Maybe.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.844
But I see badges pinned
on you and your friends.

34:43.847 --> 34:46.684
We're not planning on
bringing him in alive, Senor.

34:48.251 --> 34:50.387
Well, I'm a
tracker, not a hunter.

34:52.289 --> 34:53.889
Do we have a problem, Senor?

34:53.891 --> 34:54.759
I don't.

34:55.860 --> 34:56.592
But you might, you
don't put that steel

34:56.594 --> 34:58.128
back where it belongs.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.231
Now about my fee.

35:03.800 --> 35:04.668
Eh.

35:05.635 --> 35:06.503
Senor.

35:08.606 --> 35:11.509
When we find that Chinaman,
and we don't need you no more,

35:12.976 --> 35:15.579
we'll come back to
this conversation, huh?

35:16.579 --> 35:17.447
Can't wait.

35:18.514 --> 35:20.949
And just for the
record, I like women.

35:20.951 --> 35:23.521
Ya baby.

35:26.856 --> 35:30.258
And he says that fella's
lucky at cards too.

35:31.394 --> 35:32.260
Hey hon.

35:32.262 --> 35:33.695
Hi darlin'.

36:04.695 --> 36:06.364
Get up.

36:10.434 --> 36:12.370
Excuse me, gentlemen.

36:17.507 --> 36:20.374
Well ain't you angry
enough to fight

36:20.376 --> 36:22.510
a bear with a hickory switch?

36:22.512 --> 36:25.079
There's four good men
layin' in pine boxes

36:25.081 --> 36:28.583
out on the street right there
because of what you did.

36:28.585 --> 36:30.487
You got blood on
your hands, boy.

36:31.422 --> 36:32.757
I said I'm sorry.

36:33.757 --> 36:34.692
You're sorry.

36:35.925 --> 36:37.527
Sorry ain't good enough.

36:38.862 --> 36:41.729
I come in here and catch
you laughin' and drinkin'.

36:41.731 --> 36:44.032
Might as well be pissin'
on their corpses.

36:44.034 --> 36:46.467
Well what am I supposed to do?

36:46.469 --> 36:47.869
I ain't allowed to
hunt the bastard,

36:47.871 --> 36:53.277
I ain't allowed to drink, what
am I allowed to do, Father?

36:54.610 --> 36:55.644
You're gonna go home and
you're gonna stay there

36:55.646 --> 36:56.581
till this is done.

36:57.715 --> 37:00.014
Maybe if we're lucky,
we mend this quickly

37:00.016 --> 37:02.385
with you still alive,
but I swear to you,

37:03.686 --> 37:06.354
I catch you in town
again drinkin' or whorin'

37:06.356 --> 37:10.760
before this man is caught,
you'll have me to contend with.

37:20.971 --> 37:23.240
You best be ready to go all-in.

37:25.876 --> 37:28.312
You're not worth
the bullet, old man.

37:57.775 --> 38:01.175
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:01.177 --> 38:02.045
Whoa.

38:51.894 --> 38:52.762
Hyah.

39:02.139 --> 39:03.871
That's the horse
he stole from us.

39:03.873 --> 39:04.974
He's on foot now.

39:06.610 --> 39:07.876
Well I guess it says
something about the man

39:07.878 --> 39:08.876
you're hunting then, doesn't it?

39:08.878 --> 39:10.014
The man we're hunting.

39:11.581 --> 39:12.847
Yeah.

39:12.849 --> 39:14.050
Yeah, that's what I said.

39:15.552 --> 39:17.054
And he's not a man.

39:18.188 --> 39:19.090
Horse is lame.

39:20.490 --> 39:22.891
Figure that's why he didn't
want to ride it into the dirt.

39:22.893 --> 39:24.492
Hyah.

39:24.494 --> 39:28.697
Hyah.

39:28.699 --> 39:30.401
That horse don't look lame.

39:31.702 --> 39:33.637
Oh, you know a lot
about horses then, do ya?

39:34.972 --> 39:37.037
I know that horse
belongs to us.

39:37.039 --> 39:38.909
Well why don't you
go chase it, then?

39:40.943 --> 39:45.949
You know, gringo, you're
becoming a real pain in the ass.

39:47.284 --> 39:48.617
You might wanna have that
checked out by Dr. Wade

39:48.619 --> 39:49.787
when you get back there.

39:50.887 --> 39:52.155
Could be something serious.

39:53.523 --> 39:56.891
It's gonna be serious when
we find that Chinaman, huh?

39:56.893 --> 39:57.761
For you.

40:00.264 --> 40:03.032
I figured that's why you
ain't discussed my fee yet.

40:08.038 --> 40:09.072
Too dark now.

40:10.206 --> 40:11.305
Let's set up camp.

40:11.307 --> 40:12.641
Camp?

40:12.643 --> 40:13.807
We just found his tracks!

40:13.809 --> 40:15.911
Hey, we'll follow him now.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.780
Maybe you missed the
part about it being dark.

40:18.782 --> 40:20.684
I can't track what I can't see.

40:21.952 --> 40:22.820
Camp.

40:38.068 --> 40:38.969
Get away.

40:41.304 --> 40:42.138
Evenin'.

40:46.309 --> 40:49.311
Looks to me like
we're behind schedule.

40:49.313 --> 40:50.579
What do you expect?

40:50.581 --> 40:51.713
Chinese doing all the work.

40:51.715 --> 40:54.148
I expect when I pay
good money for a job

40:54.150 --> 40:56.519
that it oughta be done
when I need it done.

40:57.353 --> 40:58.788
Speakin' of pay.

41:00.023 --> 41:02.222
You owe me on my draw.

41:02.224 --> 41:03.760
I got mouths to feed too.

41:14.871 --> 41:16.773
You're lucky I
need those tracks.

41:19.742 --> 41:21.578
Pleasure doing
business with you.

41:36.360 --> 41:37.791
Did you hear that?

41:39.795 --> 41:40.663
Where?

41:43.266 --> 41:44.768
Spread out, spread out, dammit.

43:06.248 --> 43:07.350
You hungry?

43:11.188 --> 43:12.056
Nah.

43:18.128 --> 43:20.197
So what's your plan, son?

43:29.039 --> 43:30.841
Who said I had one?

43:33.876 --> 43:36.778
Well you just gonna
keep killin' men

43:36.780 --> 43:38.349
till you get the
one you're after?

43:39.882 --> 43:40.750
Mm-hmm.

43:42.085 --> 43:46.023
I was hoping the one I was
looking for was with you.

43:48.224 --> 43:51.161
You know Walker's son, too
lazy a pig pen.

43:52.528 --> 43:54.764
You really think he can come
out here lookin' for you?

43:55.931 --> 43:58.201
Now his father,
his father's men.

43:59.802 --> 44:03.106
That's a whole lotta guns to
go up against for a lone man.

44:08.545 --> 44:11.782
Man you after's the kinda man
that hides behind other men.

44:14.083 --> 44:15.985
They ain't stoppin'
till you're dead.

44:19.356 --> 44:20.324
I'm already dead.

44:51.822 --> 44:53.190
What are you gonna do with that?

44:54.824 --> 44:56.693
I haven't really decided yet.

44:58.094 --> 44:59.697
But I need you to stand down.

45:04.900 --> 45:05.768
Do it.

45:07.903 --> 45:09.106
Send me to my family.

45:13.409 --> 45:15.478
Why don't you walk
away from this, son.

45:27.489 --> 45:29.492
There's nothing in it.

45:35.197 --> 45:38.735
Son of a bitch, never
right place when I need it.

45:44.541 --> 45:49.747
Why don't you help me?

45:55.018 --> 45:57.420
What you want me to do, son?

46:00.489 --> 46:02.091
Just send him a message.

46:07.097 --> 46:08.065
I can do that.

46:10.300 --> 46:11.168
Whoa.

46:13.637 --> 46:14.505
Ho.

46:15.938 --> 46:18.405
What in the hell happened here?

46:18.407 --> 46:20.508
The hell you think happened?

46:20.510 --> 46:21.445
Where the marshal?

46:28.284 --> 46:30.286
Should be at his
house up on the hill.

46:38.128 --> 46:38.996
Damn.

46:40.297 --> 46:41.331
You stay here.

46:53.643 --> 46:54.976
Give me that rifle, Ben.

47:19.001 --> 47:21.270
Don't you ever
listen to me, James?

47:28.644 --> 47:29.847
The Chinaman.

47:33.048 --> 47:35.885
Well he went to us like a
hot knife to butter, didn't he?

47:37.086 --> 47:38.121
Did you lose one?

47:40.090 --> 47:42.259
Couldn't find a body
when the sun come up.

47:43.425 --> 47:45.360
Wolves I'm guessin'.

47:45.362 --> 47:47.865
Well you're the tracker,
was it wolves or not?

47:51.067 --> 47:52.133
Well after seein' what I saw,

47:52.135 --> 47:54.137
wasn't gonna stick
around to find out.

47:56.405 --> 47:58.275
How is it that
you're still alive?

47:59.541 --> 48:02.112
Well he wanted me
to deliver a message.

48:04.280 --> 48:05.282
Which is?

48:08.451 --> 48:10.420
I reckon you're lookin' at it.

48:12.521 --> 48:14.287
If you just would've
listened to me

48:14.289 --> 48:17.157
and let me take Danny and
Frank to hunt this man down

48:17.159 --> 48:19.026
we wouldn't be having
this conversation

48:19.028 --> 48:21.028
with a half-wit tracker.

48:22.199 --> 48:25.032
Well, you certainly
right about that, boy.

48:25.034 --> 48:27.003
You wouldn't be having
this conversation,

48:27.704 --> 48:29.039
because you'd be dead.

48:29.739 --> 48:30.673
Did you speak to him?

48:32.541 --> 48:34.478
Well, more accurately
he spoke to me,

48:36.179 --> 48:40.483
and he said I ends with him.

48:46.255 --> 48:48.356
Then I believe your services

48:49.092 --> 48:50.559
are no longer required.

48:54.463 --> 48:55.364
Put it away.

48:56.331 --> 48:57.199
Now.

49:04.239 --> 49:05.942
You'll be joining us for supper.

49:07.443 --> 49:09.709
We need to talk about the
details of what you saw.

49:09.711 --> 49:13.684
The more I know about
this man, the better.

49:15.385 --> 49:17.020
Well, I appreciate it, sir.

49:18.221 --> 49:19.523
But you know, I done my job.

49:20.556 --> 49:21.621
I best be gettin'.

49:21.623 --> 49:22.557
No.

49:22.559 --> 49:23.226
I insist.

49:26.362 --> 49:27.697
Kinda figured you would.

49:54.123 --> 49:55.424
To your health.

50:04.800 --> 50:07.536
You seem a bit nervous, tracker.

50:12.407 --> 50:13.275
Well.

50:14.811 --> 50:16.613
I don't feel nervous.

50:18.547 --> 50:20.149
Bit tired I guess.

50:23.418 --> 50:25.321
What can you tell
us about this man?

50:31.393 --> 50:32.827
Where you want me to start?

50:32.829 --> 50:36.666
Start with anything that'll
help us find him and kill him.

50:39.302 --> 50:42.170
Well I can tell
you from what I seen,

50:42.172 --> 50:43.206
that will not be easy.

50:45.742 --> 50:47.477
But I guess you
already know that.

50:48.878 --> 50:50.213
That's why I'm here.

50:56.585 --> 50:58.354
Do you think he'll ever stop?

51:04.360 --> 51:05.695
When he's dead.

51:09.532 --> 51:10.467
Sit down.

51:11.733 --> 51:12.400
Sit down.

51:13.902 --> 51:15.371
We're gonna listen to him.

51:20.577 --> 51:21.645
Would you stop, boy?

51:24.213 --> 51:25.081
Would you stop?

51:28.985 --> 51:31.786
Would you if they tried to
rape your pregnant wife?

51:31.788 --> 51:33.354
Would you?

51:33.356 --> 51:34.155
What about they
beat her to death

51:34.157 --> 51:35.856
with their bare hands, boy?

51:35.858 --> 51:37.257
Huh?

51:37.259 --> 51:39.994
What about they took your future
away, would you, would you?

51:39.996 --> 51:42.298
Somebody tried to rape
your pregnant wife?

51:43.465 --> 51:44.300
Would ya?

51:48.637 --> 51:49.672
Excuse us.

51:54.510 --> 51:55.679
Little pussy.

51:57.646 --> 52:00.248
Get in there.

52:00.250 --> 52:01.349
I didn't know!

52:01.351 --> 52:03.650
What you mean you
didn't know?

52:03.652 --> 52:05.920
Difference would it
make if you had known?

52:11.793 --> 52:13.894
I told you before.

52:13.896 --> 52:15.632
You better be
ready to go all-in.

52:23.706 --> 52:24.841
You ain't got the guts.

52:34.449 --> 52:36.418
There's blood on my hands too.

52:40.422 --> 52:41.290
Forgive me.

52:44.427 --> 52:47.264
You're still
holding onto your god!

52:52.735 --> 52:54.403
You think he can save me?

52:59.708 --> 53:00.943
You're beyond saving.

53:07.483 --> 53:09.586
But that's my failin', not his.

53:14.690 --> 53:15.858
I'm done with you.

53:54.664 --> 53:56.700
Boy's always been troubled.

54:03.905 --> 54:06.308
Needs some God in his life.

54:08.643 --> 54:09.511
He resists.

54:16.952 --> 54:21.724
After today, and given the
fact that I don't trust you,

54:24.594 --> 54:26.396
I think it'd be
best you left town.

54:28.164 --> 54:29.032
Tonight.

54:31.934 --> 54:34.638
Well I best get a head
start on that leavin' then.

54:37.672 --> 54:41.944
I'll ride with ya, so
you don't change your mind.

55:08.170 --> 55:09.038
Whoa.

55:13.675 --> 55:17.545
It doesn't look like
you brought enough men.

55:17.547 --> 55:19.146
Don't you worry about it.

55:19.148 --> 55:20.550
I can get more.

57:29.612 --> 57:30.480
Shh.

57:33.014 --> 57:34.983
I got ya now, China boy.

57:37.853 --> 57:40.887
Shoulda picked up that gun
that day in the street.

57:51.067 --> 57:54.003
It's a shame you did so much
and accomplished so little.

58:05.146 --> 58:08.115
Come on, let's get outta here.

58:08.117 --> 58:09.952
Go, go, go, go!

58:25.668 --> 58:28.001
Ain't safe here, son.

58:28.003 --> 58:29.639
They gonna be back.

58:30.306 --> 58:31.173
More guns.

58:32.041 --> 58:33.876
And they gonna keep comin' back.

58:34.844 --> 58:36.644
I'm counting on it.

58:36.646 --> 58:37.514
You can leave.

58:39.914 --> 58:41.985
Oh I can, can I?

58:45.420 --> 58:48.524
It seems I done too
much of that already.

58:49.891 --> 58:53.195
And while I appreciate that,
I got no other place to be.

58:55.931 --> 58:57.534
I don't even know your name.

58:59.434 --> 59:02.271
My daddy gave me
Christopher King.

59:05.440 --> 59:07.175
But my friends call me Chris.

59:11.947 --> 59:15.018
You know it's customary
you give your name back.

59:17.018 --> 59:19.787
Jing Phang.

59:19.789 --> 59:22.222
Well it's a pleasure
to meet ya, Jing Phang.

59:24.159 --> 59:25.894
Son of a bitch, son.

59:28.697 --> 59:31.065
Let's get you fixed up.

59:31.067 --> 59:31.934
Come on now.

59:57.726 --> 01:00:00.260
I think I'm gonna
like this place.

01:00:00.262 --> 01:00:02.896
Your woman as pretty
as this shit hole?

01:00:02.898 --> 01:00:05.465
Let me make something
clear to you boys.

01:00:05.467 --> 01:00:06.668
This is my town.

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:10.037
As long as you're in my town,
you're gonna treat my people

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:12.139
with respect, or
you'll end up in jail

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:14.210
or swingin' on
the end of a rope.

01:00:21.416 --> 01:00:23.752
Yes sir, Marshal sir.

01:00:25.019 --> 01:00:26.655
Am I gonna regret hirin' you?

01:00:28.423 --> 01:00:29.826
We'll get the job done.

01:00:31.126 --> 01:00:32.128
All right.

01:00:35.396 --> 01:00:36.632
You see anything?

01:00:44.072 --> 01:00:45.141
Why only one?

01:00:46.307 --> 01:00:47.143
Yeah.

01:00:48.543 --> 01:00:51.246
That's all you need if there's
only one man you want dead.

01:00:52.914 --> 01:00:53.882
Who you tryin' to kill?

01:00:55.851 --> 01:00:57.787
You ask a lot of
questions, don't ya?

01:01:04.326 --> 01:01:06.061
I apologize about that, son.

01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:13.934
What about you, you got
family back in China?

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:16.105
Brothers, sisters?

01:01:18.873 --> 01:01:20.374
No.

01:01:20.376 --> 01:01:21.244
You?

01:01:23.445 --> 01:01:24.947
Baby brother named Porter.

01:01:27.382 --> 01:01:32.387
Mom and Dad died young, so
he's more like a son, but

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:36.759
that boy's special.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.295
Where is he now?

01:01:41.396 --> 01:01:46.134
In a hole, next to
his mama and his daddy.

01:01:55.143 --> 01:01:57.446
This Colt right here,
last piece of him I got.

01:02:00.148 --> 01:02:03.050
And I tell you
somethin', this son bitch

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:04.854
woulda fired when
it's supposed to,

01:02:07.489 --> 01:02:09.356
maybe it'd be him
sittin' on these steps

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:10.760
having this conversation.

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:19.302
That bullet, it's
meant for you, isn't it?

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.474
Well I tried convincing
of that for a while, but

01:02:26.141 --> 01:02:27.876
seems that bullet
got other plans.

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:31.213
It don't matter, though.

01:02:32.414 --> 01:02:34.050
Can't hide from it forever.

01:02:36.418 --> 01:02:38.121
It'll come home when it's ready.

01:02:47.028 --> 01:02:48.030
They all dead.

01:02:49.264 --> 01:02:51.067
He came at us like
a wild bobcat.

01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:54.436
Took out three of our men.

01:02:56.905 --> 01:02:58.206
I didn't sign up for this.

01:02:59.407 --> 01:03:01.176
You say you want to
bring down one guy.

01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:04.378
You're gettin'
paid to do a job.

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.315
You're not paying
us enough for this.

01:03:09.518 --> 01:03:10.918
We had a deal.

01:03:17.992 --> 01:03:19.929
Unless you wanna
be a fool, Marshal,

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:24.132
I'd be putting that gun away
and deal with your own problem.

01:03:28.603 --> 01:03:31.304
Well hold on, gentlemen,
I'll double your fare.

01:03:31.306 --> 01:03:32.606
Boy.

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:35.344
I'm feelin' generous,
gentlemen, I'll triple it.

01:03:40.081 --> 01:03:42.117
Now you're talking
my kind of language.

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:44.320
Let's go, boys.

01:03:52.293 --> 01:03:54.994
Where you think you're goin'?

01:03:54.996 --> 01:03:55.864
James?

01:04:03.505 --> 01:04:07.376
I'm going to finish
what you couldn't end.

01:04:09.577 --> 01:04:10.445
No you're not.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.778
You're going back
to town with me,

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.481
and you're going to the
church, where you'll be safe,

01:04:15.483 --> 01:04:19.251
and where you can ask for
forgiveness for what you've done.

01:04:19.253 --> 01:04:20.255
Forgiveness?

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:23.459
From who, God?

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:28.898
I shoulda stopped
you myself, years ago.

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:34.237
Take your hands
off me, old man.

01:04:36.237 --> 01:04:40.139
What would your mother think
about what you've become?

01:04:40.141 --> 01:04:41.576
You don't get to mention her.

01:04:47.215 --> 01:04:51.050
I know what you did,
when I was a child,

01:04:51.052 --> 01:04:52.355
I watched you beat her.

01:04:53.655 --> 01:04:55.557
You never thought I
saw that, did you?

01:04:59.661 --> 01:05:02.530
Every night after
you drank, her blood

01:05:03.565 --> 01:05:05.668
stained on your hands.

01:05:11.039 --> 01:05:14.242
Now you talk about
the man I've become.

01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:17.946
Well, the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree, does it?

01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:24.351
I used to look up to you.

01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:26.322
Shit, I had to, my whole life.

01:05:28.356 --> 01:05:31.691
I wanted to be you,
I wanted to

01:05:31.693 --> 01:05:34.130
take control like you do.

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:39.502
But you found God, and became

01:05:42.336 --> 01:05:44.572
the shell of a man
who I once worshiped.

01:05:49.277 --> 01:05:50.346
You became weak.

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:44.000
He will wipe every
tear from their eyes.

01:06:45.367 --> 01:06:49.702
There will be no more death
or mourning or crying or pain,

01:06:49.704 --> 01:06:54.210
for the old order of
things has passed away.

01:06:55.643 --> 01:06:57.445
Revelation 21:4.

01:07:03.385 --> 01:07:04.553
Go be with your God.

01:07:07.155 --> 01:07:08.724
You always loved
him more than me.

01:07:27.775 --> 01:07:28.643
Let's go.

01:07:45.827 --> 01:07:47.327
No one's here.

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:48.195
Where the hell are they?

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:52.661
Let's go, boy.

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:07.376
It's perfect.

01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:18.550
You're perfect.

01:09:18.551 --> 01:09:19.421
Forever.

01:09:20.822 --> 01:09:21.689
Forever.

01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:46.879
Wake up!

01:09:53.421 --> 01:09:54.754
Hmm.

01:09:54.756 --> 01:09:56.955
That's it, keep him awake.

01:09:56.957 --> 01:09:59.594
I want him to see
everything that is coming.

01:10:06.868 --> 01:10:08.571
Nice of you to join us.

01:10:14.576 --> 01:10:18.410
When I say I am sorry about
what happened to your wife,

01:10:18.412 --> 01:10:22.217
know that I mean it from
the bottom of my heart.

01:10:26.054 --> 01:10:31.260
It's a pity to think of
all the fun we could've had

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:36.632
every night, had she
of been less weak.

01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:52.044
My father would've
approved of this,

01:10:52.046 --> 01:10:53.948
it's a shame he's
not around to see it.

01:10:55.649 --> 01:10:57.951
He would've liked that I settled

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:59.588
our little quarrel
all by myself.

01:11:03.725 --> 01:11:07.896
But I want you to
watch your friend die

01:11:09.597 --> 01:11:11.300
before you return to the dust.

01:11:16.637 --> 01:11:17.939
So let's get right to that.

01:11:29.583 --> 01:11:31.586
There's an old friend.

01:11:33.688 --> 01:11:34.789
I bet you miss.

01:11:35.756 --> 01:11:37.656
Always a joker.

01:11:37.658 --> 01:11:39.394
I admire that, tracker.

01:11:43.097 --> 01:11:43.966
Do it.

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.472
Shoot him!

01:12:28.676 --> 01:12:29.877
Jesus Christ.

01:13:50.824 --> 01:13:52.692
You put that steel
back where it belongs.

01:13:53.761 --> 01:13:54.595
Do it.

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:58.500
Hyah.

01:14:39.873 --> 01:14:40.742
Get up!

01:14:43.944 --> 01:14:44.813
Get up.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.548
Get up!

01:15:03.297 --> 01:15:04.699
Forever.

01:19:45.462 --> 01:19:50.462
