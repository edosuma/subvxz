WEBVTT

00:02.019 --> 00:04.587
Over 68 million Americans

00:04.621 --> 00:07.423
leave the safety of our
borders every year.

00:07.457 --> 00:08.924
If danger strikes,

00:08.959 --> 00:11.160
the FBI's international response team

00:11.194 --> 00:13.462
is called into action.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:24.775 --> 00:27.076
Hey! Please! Please! Let me show you!

00:27.110 --> 00:28.677
This is 200.

00:32.215 --> 00:35.851
Oh! Honey.

00:35.886 --> 00:37.853
Isn't this marvelous?

00:37.888 --> 00:40.856
For you, friends, special
price, 300 dirham.

00:40.891 --> 00:42.925
300? I'll give you 50.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.327
250. Sir, this is one-of-a-kind.

00:46.196 --> 00:47.596
Okay, okay.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.331
200, but that is as low as I can go.

00:49.366 --> 00:50.132
I will go hungry.

00:50.167 --> 00:53.202
I know we said no souvenirs, but...

00:53.236 --> 00:54.837
$20.

00:54.871 --> 00:56.138
Isn't it beautiful?

00:56.173 --> 00:58.607
Yes. Yes, very beautiful.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.509
You should listen to the lady.
Very smart woman.

01:00.544 --> 01:01.477
Sir, you're a lucky man.

01:01.511 --> 01:04.046
Yes, I am. 75.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.048
Go with it. It's part of the bit.

01:06.082 --> 01:07.850
Ah, sir. You're twisting my arm.

01:07.884 --> 01:09.218
Okay. Uh, 125.

01:09.252 --> 01:11.153
No, thanks.

01:11.188 --> 01:13.289
This isn't the good stuff, anyway.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.558
My friend, my friend.
You are a wise man.

01:15.592 --> 01:17.126
This cheap. It's for tourists.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.994
You want to see real Moroccan khimar?

01:19.029 --> 01:20.863
- Hmm?
- Come.

01:20.897 --> 01:22.431
What'd I tell you?

01:37.013 --> 01:38.647
This way.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.049
Here, for you!

01:42.786 --> 01:45.254
Okay, people. Time to
head back to the ship.

01:45.288 --> 01:46.822
 No, no!

01:46.857 --> 01:48.357
Help!

01:48.391 --> 01:50.326
No!

01:50.360 --> 01:51.760
Help!

01:55.932 --> 01:59.268
Gentlemen. Please be reasonable.

01:59.302 --> 02:02.071
Now, we can find terms
amenable to both sides.

02:02.105 --> 02:05.608
But first, I need you both to
agree to a temporary dÃ©tente.

02:05.642 --> 02:09.011
They're children, Matt. Use
words they can understand.

02:09.044 --> 02:10.913
He started it!

02:10.947 --> 02:12.414
He said Daron Von Spacewarp

02:12.449 --> 02:14.850
could kick Captain Freedom's b-u-t.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.785
Baron Spacewarp is the most awesomest

02:16.820 --> 02:18.387
Space Marshal in the universe!

02:18.421 --> 02:19.922
- Is not!
- Is so!

02:19.956 --> 02:21.790
Uh, FBI train you for this?

02:21.825 --> 02:24.126
Guys. The record is pretty clear.

02:24.160 --> 02:27.863
Spacewarp is the most
imposing lawman of 2114.

02:27.898 --> 02:28.831
See?

02:28.865 --> 02:33.469
But Captain Freedom
is awesome right now.

02:33.503 --> 02:35.638
And I know that because I work for him.

02:35.672 --> 02:37.473
You know what Captain Freedom would say

02:37.507 --> 02:38.707
in a situation like this?

02:38.742 --> 02:39.909
- No.
- What?

02:39.943 --> 02:42.077
Well, he would say...

02:50.153 --> 02:51.620
Good morning, Simmons.

02:51.655 --> 02:53.222
- Hey, cap.
- We caught another case.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.591
- Kidnapping in Morocco.
- Yeah.

02:57.093 --> 02:58.127
Be right there.

03:01.031 --> 03:02.164
Evening, everyone.

03:02.198 --> 03:03.999
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey, Jack.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.336
This afternoon, Peter and Kate Carson

03:07.370 --> 03:08.771
of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho,

03:08.805 --> 03:10.940
were abducted in Casablanca, Morocco,

03:10.974 --> 03:13.108
while they were visiting on a cruise.

03:13.143 --> 03:15.844
Six hours later, the family
received ransom demands...

03:15.879 --> 03:16.979
$400,000 U.S.

03:17.013 --> 03:19.415
Or the kidnappers say
they'll kill the hostages.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.749
Method of contact?

03:20.784 --> 03:22.751
Proof of life was photographic,

03:22.786 --> 03:24.420
sent via anonymous e-mail.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.088
Ransom demand came by way of phone call

03:26.122 --> 03:27.022
to the victims' families.

03:27.057 --> 03:28.490
Now, the call was routed

03:28.525 --> 03:30.125
through a darknet V.O.I.P. relay.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.427
By darknet, you mean...

03:31.461 --> 03:33.028
Tor routed. Untraceable.

03:33.063 --> 03:34.430
That's what I was afraid of.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.198
They demanded the ransom
be paid in Bitcoin.

03:36.232 --> 03:38.167
This ain't these guys' first dance.

03:38.201 --> 03:39.301
Doesn't look like it.

03:39.336 --> 03:42.638
Seems like we're dealing
with experienced kidnappers.

03:42.672 --> 03:44.974
The family was instructed
not to contact authorities.

03:45.008 --> 03:46.842
Naturally, their first call was to us.

03:46.876 --> 03:49.111
The man on the phone said he'd
call back in eight hours.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.814
Monty's gonna intercept the call
and re-route it to the jet.

03:51.848 --> 03:54.149
What do we have on similar
incidents in the area?

03:54.184 --> 03:56.952
There have been somewhere
between 90 and 100 abductions

03:56.987 --> 03:58.354
in Morocco in the last decade,

03:58.388 --> 04:00.322
most in the Southern desert regions.

04:00.357 --> 04:03.192
Most are local clans involved
in petty land skirmishes.

04:03.226 --> 04:04.960
It's very rare to involve tourists,

04:04.995 --> 04:06.028
and never Americans until now.

04:06.062 --> 04:07.863
Reports in the area are
still filed by hand,

04:07.897 --> 04:09.898
so Interpol said it would take
a while to scan and send.

04:09.933 --> 04:12.334
Let us know what you find.

04:12.369 --> 04:14.503
This says that the Carsons were
taken from a crowded market

04:14.537 --> 04:15.771
without attracting any attention.

04:15.805 --> 04:19.208
Well, grabbing two people would
require a team, multiple unsubs.

04:19.242 --> 04:21.043
Yes, but in my experience,

04:21.077 --> 04:22.678
any more than three or four

04:22.712 --> 04:25.481
would be too many to
effectively coordinate.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.216
Yeah, but there's got to be a leader,

04:27.250 --> 04:28.650
somebody calling the shots.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.719
And a point man... someone
who could lure the Carsons

04:30.754 --> 04:32.187
without raising suspicions.

04:32.222 --> 04:33.722
Has to be around a lot of people.

04:33.757 --> 04:34.323
And left a trace.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.859
That's where we start...

04:36.893 --> 04:38.527
the spotter.

04:40.897 --> 04:43.599
Peter. Who are those men?

04:43.633 --> 04:45.234
I don't know.

04:45.268 --> 04:46.769
This... this blindfold...

04:52.776 --> 04:54.209
Oh, god.

04:54.244 --> 04:56.345
What? What is it?

05:04.988 --> 05:06.722
It's him.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.730
Hello.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.467
Hello?

05:18.501 --> 05:21.203
The family was told
not to contact anyone.

05:21.237 --> 05:23.806
They didn't. The cruise line did.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.408
To whom am I speaking?

05:26.443 --> 05:28.444
He's educated.

05:28.478 --> 05:30.579
This is Jack Garrett of the FBI.

05:30.613 --> 05:32.781
So... do you have my money?

05:32.816 --> 05:34.917
I'm working on it.

05:34.951 --> 05:37.086
So what do I call you?
What's your name?

05:37.120 --> 05:39.054
You can call me Ben.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.323
Ben. What's the significance?

05:41.357 --> 05:42.157
Well, listen to me, Ben.

05:42.192 --> 05:43.926
We both want the same thing here...

05:43.960 --> 05:46.328
for you to get paid and for the Carsons

05:46.362 --> 05:49.031
to be returned safely to their family.

05:52.869 --> 05:54.470
Are you a father, Ben?

05:57.107 --> 05:58.740
Not a father.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.343
He's unwilling to give up any
unnecessary information.

06:01.377 --> 06:02.778
I need to speak with the Carsons.

06:02.812 --> 06:03.979
I need to know they're okay.

06:04.013 --> 06:06.348
- Where is my money?
- It's coming.

06:06.382 --> 06:08.584
You've done this before. You
know it's gonna take time.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.186
But for right now, I need to
speak with Peter and Kate.

06:11.221 --> 06:12.488
No.

06:12.522 --> 06:16.158
You get me my money,
Jack Garrett of the FBI.

06:16.192 --> 06:19.628
You have 72 hours or the Carsons die.

Kahlil Gibran.

06:54.338 --> 06:55.939
68 hours.

06:55.973 --> 06:57.740
The clock's ticking.

06:57.775 --> 06:59.776
We ready?

06:59.810 --> 07:01.644
Simmons, head to the abduction site.

07:01.679 --> 07:03.479
See what the kidnappers left behind.

07:03.514 --> 07:06.416
Salah Sabila of the Casablanca P.D.
will meet you there.

07:06.450 --> 07:07.216
On it.

07:07.251 --> 07:09.152
Mae, you and Clara head to the ship.

07:09.186 --> 07:11.487
Start a victimology from
the Carsons' state room

07:11.522 --> 07:13.156
and the other people on that tour.

07:13.190 --> 07:14.157
Where you headed, Jack?

07:14.191 --> 07:16.059
You're not the only one

07:16.093 --> 07:17.493
who has to deal with children.

07:20.531 --> 07:22.432
No, Sir. According
to international law,

07:22.466 --> 07:24.300
this ship is subject only to the laws

07:24.335 --> 07:26.135
of the country under
whose flag she flies.

07:26.170 --> 07:27.637
Not while you're in port.

07:27.671 --> 07:29.572
Here, I am the rule of law.

07:29.606 --> 07:30.573
If you think I'm letting you

07:30.607 --> 07:32.308
- or any of your thugs on board this...
- Thugs?

07:32.343 --> 07:34.744
You heard me. The crime
happened in your square.

07:34.778 --> 07:37.146
Why won't you let my men come
into town and investigate?

07:37.181 --> 07:38.481
Because you are visitors.

07:38.515 --> 07:39.983
And you're incompetent.

07:40.017 --> 07:41.351
Gentlemen.

07:41.385 --> 07:43.519
Unit Chief Jack Barrett of the FBI.

07:43.554 --> 07:45.488
The first thing for
both of you to remember

07:45.522 --> 07:48.324
is that we're here to get Peter
and Kate Carson back alive.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.128
My team has been in touch
with the kidnappers.

07:52.162 --> 07:54.664
Their P.O.C. is a man
who calls himself Ben.

07:54.698 --> 07:57.467
We want to focus our
efforts on locating him.

07:57.501 --> 07:58.801
What do you have?

08:00.537 --> 08:02.705
Nothing.

08:02.740 --> 08:03.940
Great.

08:03.974 --> 08:05.308
Chief Inspector Rains,

08:05.342 --> 08:07.477
considering the victims are Americans,

08:07.511 --> 08:09.879
would you mind if the
FBI ran point on this?

08:09.913 --> 08:12.048
No. That would be fine.

08:12.082 --> 08:13.483
Good. Mr. Veidt,

08:13.517 --> 08:15.385
while you may be head of security

08:15.419 --> 08:16.519
while the ship's at sea,

08:16.553 --> 08:19.389
on land, we're all subject
to the laws and conventions

08:19.423 --> 08:20.356
of the kingdom of Morocco.

08:20.391 --> 08:22.558
Please order your men
to stay on the ship.

08:22.593 --> 08:24.293
Yes, Sir.

08:24.328 --> 08:27.130
We'd like to interview
some of the crew.

08:29.033 --> 08:31.334
Great. Let's go to work.

08:36.840 --> 08:40.076
Agent Montgomery, my dad taught
sixth grade for 40 years.

08:40.110 --> 08:42.311
I mean, my mom was a social worker.

08:42.346 --> 08:44.547
They built habitat
houses in the summer.

08:44.581 --> 08:47.550
There's no way we can
come up with $400,000.

08:47.584 --> 08:48.684
I'm not asking you to.

08:48.719 --> 08:51.421
I just have to let you know
that the rules have changed.

08:51.455 --> 08:54.590
The FBI would be allowed to help
facilitate any ransom exchange

08:54.625 --> 08:56.893
if you had the money and
if that were your choice.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.529
My parents had to scrimp and
save to go on this trip.

08:59.563 --> 09:02.398
It was supposed to be my dad's
retirement celebration.

09:02.433 --> 09:05.334
I just... I don't understand.

09:05.369 --> 09:07.236
Why would anyone want to kidnap them?

09:07.271 --> 09:08.404
We're still trying to figure that out.

09:08.439 --> 09:10.173
So this is how it works?

09:10.207 --> 09:13.509
You save your entire life
and then you get kidnapped?

09:13.544 --> 09:15.445
Stay strong, Grace.

09:15.479 --> 09:18.247
Agent Garrett and his team will
do everything in their power

09:18.282 --> 09:19.982
to bring your parents home safe.

09:23.659 --> 09:24.659
_

09:25.279 --> 09:26.279
_

09:26.457 --> 09:27.757
Did you hear that?

09:27.791 --> 09:29.425
I think they said FBI.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.794
Shh! I'm trying to listen.

09:38.936 --> 09:40.303
Oh, my god.

09:40.337 --> 09:42.338
He's just a child.

09:44.341 --> 09:45.475
Water.

09:45.509 --> 09:47.310
Please.

09:47.344 --> 09:48.578
He speaks English.

09:48.612 --> 09:50.546
- What's your name?
- Please.

09:50.581 --> 09:52.915
We don't have much, but we'll
give you whatever we can.

09:52.950 --> 09:54.450
Just let us go.

09:56.453 --> 09:58.454
Please.

09:58.489 --> 09:59.355
Come back!

10:12.769 --> 10:14.437
Right over there.

10:16.673 --> 10:17.754
_

10:18.072 --> 10:19.072
_

10:20.144 --> 10:21.875
_

10:22.179 --> 10:23.279
I am Sabila.

10:23.313 --> 10:25.681
SSA Matt Simmons, FBI.

10:25.716 --> 10:27.450
Oh, yes. We've been expecting you.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.539
_

10:30.821 --> 10:32.455
Suspect?

10:32.489 --> 10:33.589
He is a nobody.

10:33.624 --> 10:36.759
We're just trying to put a
little scare into the locals.

10:36.793 --> 10:38.628
Mm.

10:38.662 --> 10:41.097
This market is a how do you say...

10:41.131 --> 10:43.533
a wretched hive of scum and villainy?

10:43.567 --> 10:46.602
So, do we have a crime scene?

10:46.637 --> 10:47.803
Not really.

10:47.838 --> 10:50.973
The souk sets up every morning,
tears down every night.

10:51.008 --> 10:52.808
The carts change places every day,

10:52.843 --> 10:55.545
so there's not much left in
terms of physical evidence.

10:55.579 --> 10:59.615
Well, I can see at least a dozen
potential points of egress.

10:59.650 --> 11:01.551
14, by my count.

11:01.585 --> 11:04.854
So the kidnappers could have
come and gone from anywhere.

11:06.924 --> 11:08.558
It's a lot busier than I remember.

11:08.592 --> 11:11.527
The market has undergone a
revival in recent years.

11:11.562 --> 11:13.996
Nowadays, people travel
from thousands of miles

11:14.031 --> 11:16.632
to sell their wares in
the Casablanca bazaar.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.534
So, between the vendors
and the customers,

11:18.569 --> 11:20.570
any given day you're getting, what,

11:20.604 --> 11:22.638
a couple thousand people
coming through here?

11:22.673 --> 11:25.508
Anybody see anything?

11:25.542 --> 11:27.009
Ah.

11:27.044 --> 11:28.411
You didn't ask.

11:28.445 --> 11:30.580
'Cause you're too busy
harassing the locals.

11:30.614 --> 11:32.081
We were getting around to it.

11:32.115 --> 11:33.749
Mm-hmm. Let me help you with that.

11:33.784 --> 11:36.786
Yeah, we'll start with the merchants.

11:41.058 --> 11:42.291
Thank you.

11:43.927 --> 11:46.762
Okay.

11:46.797 --> 11:47.930
Interior stateroom.

11:47.965 --> 11:49.632
Save on the tickets.

11:52.936 --> 11:55.371
Budget luggage.

11:58.709 --> 12:00.409
Tips for cheap travel.

12:04.414 --> 12:07.383
Some leftovers from the ship's buffet.

12:10.487 --> 12:14.724
So if organized, methodical
kidnappers target their victims,

12:14.758 --> 12:16.092
why would they choose a couple

12:16.126 --> 12:18.094
who so clearly don't have any money?

12:30.474 --> 12:32.775
Oh ho ho. What's with the bling, Mr.
Carson?

12:32.809 --> 12:34.543
Can't afford a room with a view,

12:34.578 --> 12:37.046
but you can afford a $6,000 watch.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.081
It was a gift.

12:39.116 --> 12:40.716
When Dad announced his retirement,

12:40.751 --> 12:42.451
the whole community got together

12:42.486 --> 12:44.487
and created a scholarship
fund in his name.

12:44.521 --> 12:46.455
And they gave him the
watch as a thank-you

12:46.490 --> 12:47.390
for 40 years of service.

12:47.424 --> 12:49.392
People must have really liked your dad.

12:51.528 --> 12:54.664
You know how everyone
has that one teacher

12:54.698 --> 12:57.300
that really believed in
them, changed their lives?

12:57.334 --> 13:00.903
Mr. Eastman. A.P. Calculus.

13:00.937 --> 13:04.807
My father was that to so many people.

13:04.841 --> 13:06.809
He was so proud of that watch.

13:06.843 --> 13:07.877
He wore it everywhere.

13:09.446 --> 13:11.514
You don't really think that's
what got them kidnapped?

13:11.548 --> 13:12.515
We don't know.

13:12.549 --> 13:15.951
But at this point, it
does fill in some blanks.

13:17.854 --> 13:20.756
Why would I know them?

13:20.791 --> 13:21.691
'Cause several people are saying

13:21.725 --> 13:22.558
they saw you bartering
with them yesterday.

13:22.592 --> 13:24.527
I see hundreds of people here a day.

13:24.561 --> 13:26.228
I'm supposed to remember them all?

13:28.131 --> 13:29.131
There were suggestions

13:29.166 --> 13:31.834
that you may have shown
them into the back room.

13:31.868 --> 13:33.035
Hey! Hey!

13:33.070 --> 13:34.770
You have something to hide, Hassan?

13:34.805 --> 13:36.706
No. Nothing.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.541
My friend, you like? I
can make you a deal.

13:38.575 --> 13:40.476
I can... I can make you an offer.

13:40.510 --> 13:43.479
See, Hassan, this type of behavior...

13:43.513 --> 13:45.181
this suggests to us something we call

13:45.215 --> 13:46.716
"avoidance and transference".

13:46.750 --> 13:48.017
It's what makes me think you're lying.

13:48.051 --> 13:49.618
Of course he's lying. Look at him.

13:49.653 --> 13:51.654
If you hadn't seen the Carsons,
why didn't you just tell us?

13:51.688 --> 13:53.489
I did! I did!

13:53.523 --> 13:55.358
No, you didn't. No, you didn't.

13:55.392 --> 13:56.826
When I asked if you'd seen them,

13:56.860 --> 13:58.027
you asked me why would you have.

13:58.061 --> 13:59.528
Then when I ask you a follow-up,

13:59.563 --> 14:00.863
you make it about pretty much anything

14:00.897 --> 14:02.331
except for the question I asked you.

14:02.366 --> 14:03.699
You want me to beat him a little?

14:03.734 --> 14:04.900
No, no.

14:04.935 --> 14:06.001
Thanks.

14:06.036 --> 14:07.737
Hassan.

14:07.771 --> 14:08.471
Are you gonna tell me what happened

14:08.505 --> 14:09.772
between you and the Carsons?

14:15.779 --> 14:16.812
Hey!

14:22.452 --> 14:23.986
Hey!

14:43.974 --> 14:45.241
That's perfectly all right.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.176
You can't remember what you didn't see.

14:47.210 --> 14:48.277
Thanks for your time.

14:48.311 --> 14:50.413
No problem.

14:50.447 --> 14:51.847
Next.

14:51.882 --> 14:54.950
Please. I-it wasn't my idea.

14:54.985 --> 14:56.352
It was the merchant's.

14:56.386 --> 14:58.421
You know, we could have saved time

14:58.455 --> 15:00.689
if we had done this from the start.

15:00.724 --> 15:02.625
Where are the Carsons, Hassan?

15:02.659 --> 15:04.126
I showed them some clothing.

15:04.161 --> 15:06.028
They went on their way. I swear it!

15:06.062 --> 15:07.930
Everybody saw them come in.
Nobody saw them go out.

15:07.964 --> 15:08.731
Where are they?

15:08.765 --> 15:10.399
No, they went out through the back.

15:10.434 --> 15:12.635
You see? They left.

15:12.669 --> 15:14.970
The last I saw, they were
talking to another man.

15:15.005 --> 15:16.172
Describe him.

15:17.674 --> 15:19.809
The vendor said he was a clean-cut man

15:19.843 --> 15:22.445
in his 20s or 30s wearing
Western clothes.

15:22.479 --> 15:23.312
Body language and linguistics

15:23.346 --> 15:24.814
make me think he was telling the truth,

15:24.848 --> 15:25.815
but he was holding something back.

15:25.849 --> 15:26.982
- I don't know what.
- I do.

15:27.017 --> 15:28.584
He and some of the other shop owners

15:28.618 --> 15:29.919
were running a kickback scheme

15:29.953 --> 15:31.454
with one of the tour
guides from the boat.

15:31.488 --> 15:34.223
The guide would steer
inexperienced travelers

15:34.257 --> 15:36.225
towards specific
shopkeepers in the souk

15:36.259 --> 15:38.260
who would overcharge
for cheap souvenirs.

15:38.295 --> 15:39.895
Then they'd send a
portion of the profits

15:39.930 --> 15:41.797
back to the tour guide
as a finder's fee.

15:41.832 --> 15:43.999
It's too basic a scam to be our unsubs,

15:44.034 --> 15:46.969
but they may have been watching,
using it to identify targets.

15:47.003 --> 15:49.004
It's a good start.

15:49.039 --> 15:51.607
Guys, I got something, and
you're not gonna like it.

15:51.641 --> 15:53.442
Interpol found three other kidnappings

15:53.477 --> 15:56.078
over the last five years with
the same M.O. as the Carsons'.

15:56.112 --> 15:58.013
Couples grabbed off cruise ships.

15:58.048 --> 16:00.983
Same anonymous e-mail server,
same Bitcoin address.

16:01.017 --> 16:01.851
None of the victims were American,

16:01.885 --> 16:03.185
or else we would have heard of them.

16:03.220 --> 16:04.320
These aren't even in Morocco.

16:04.354 --> 16:05.921
These cases are in Algeria,

16:05.956 --> 16:07.022
Tunisia, and Libya.

16:07.057 --> 16:08.824
And it gets worse.

16:08.859 --> 16:11.026
In each of these cases, whether
the ransom was paid or not,

16:11.061 --> 16:13.596
all the victims were killed by
a single gunshot to the head.

16:13.630 --> 16:15.097
These aren't simple kidnappers.

16:15.131 --> 16:17.600
They're serial killers.

16:17.634 --> 16:19.835
And we've got 51 hours to find them.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.611
_

16:31.776 --> 16:32.834
_

16:41.391 --> 16:43.492
Jack, things have changed.

16:43.527 --> 16:45.861
I want my money in 24 hours

16:45.896 --> 16:47.997
or I start sending body parts.

16:58.524 --> 17:00.626
16 hours.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.236
Why shorten the timeline now

17:02.271 --> 17:03.905
and not in any of the previous cases?

17:03.939 --> 17:05.071
Look.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.874
Every time that they take someone,

17:06.909 --> 17:08.041
the ransom goes up...

17:08.076 --> 17:09.977
$50,000, $75,000,

17:10.012 --> 17:11.979
$200,000, and now $400,000.

17:12.013 --> 17:13.214
So, they're either getting bolder

17:13.248 --> 17:14.714
or they're getting more desperate.

17:14.750 --> 17:17.952
Moving the deadline makes
me think it's the latter.

17:17.986 --> 17:20.253
They're not just greedy.
They need money.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.556
For what?

17:21.589 --> 17:23.458
Drugs? Guns? Debts?

17:23.492 --> 17:25.126
So, what do we know about them?

17:25.160 --> 17:28.262
They're not emotional.

17:28.297 --> 17:31.232
Gunshot wound to the head is...
is dispassionate.

17:31.266 --> 17:33.968
If it was a single actor, I'd
say they were unbalanced,

17:34.002 --> 17:36.938
but groups tend to keep
one another in check.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.639
For five years?

17:38.674 --> 17:41.275
It's a long time for people
like this to stay together.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.344
So they're tight-knit, loyal.

17:43.378 --> 17:44.412
Could they be family?

17:44.446 --> 17:46.180
I mean Ben means "son" in Arabic.

17:46.215 --> 17:48.349
Family or not, they're mobile.

17:48.383 --> 17:50.818
It's 1,200 miles from the
first abduction site to here.

17:50.853 --> 17:52.920
Why go all that way for
a snatch-and-grab?

17:52.955 --> 17:54.522
You know, at the market, Salah,

17:54.556 --> 17:56.958
he said that people
travel thousands of miles

17:56.992 --> 17:59.160
to sell their goods at
the Casablanca bazaar.

17:59.194 --> 18:01.796
Now, I thought he was
exaggerating, but...

18:01.830 --> 18:04.465
but North Africa is home
to some of the world's

18:04.500 --> 18:07.335
most wide-ranging nomadic
merchant populations.

18:07.369 --> 18:09.270
- You mean like gypsies.
- Uh-huh.

18:09.304 --> 18:11.305
That'd be a great way
for the unsubs to hide.

18:14.209 --> 18:16.611
Monty, find resources that track

18:16.645 --> 18:19.380
the migratory patterns of
North African merchants.

18:19.414 --> 18:22.149
We're looking for a group that
may have been in the area

18:22.184 --> 18:24.285
during each of the three
prior kidnappings.

18:29.258 --> 18:30.757
_

18:31.293 --> 18:32.722
_

18:32.848 --> 18:34.282
_

18:34.714 --> 18:35.714
_

18:36.242 --> 18:38.005
_

18:38.560 --> 18:39.560
_

18:39.660 --> 18:40.660
_

18:41.292 --> 18:42.963
_

18:45.274 --> 18:48.209
You understand.

18:48.243 --> 18:50.111
What are they saying?

18:52.781 --> 18:56.417
His hands are rough like worker.

18:56.451 --> 18:59.420
I-I build houses in the summer.

18:59.454 --> 19:02.623
Rich people build
houses in your country?

19:04.359 --> 19:08.362
I told you. We're not rich.

19:11.266 --> 19:14.035
I really appreciate it.

19:15.637 --> 19:17.171
I can do that.

19:17.205 --> 19:18.673
I understand.

19:18.707 --> 19:21.242
Thank you.

19:21.276 --> 19:22.510
Good news?

19:22.544 --> 19:23.744
Yes.

19:23.779 --> 19:26.047
The bank agreed to give me an
emergency loan against my house.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.381
I can pay the ransom.

19:29.117 --> 19:31.452
You have news. What is it?

19:31.486 --> 19:33.120
It's not about your parents,

19:33.155 --> 19:35.523
but we have identified
three other kidnappings

19:35.557 --> 19:36.524
by the same group.

19:36.558 --> 19:40.227
In those cases, when
the ransom was paid...

19:40.262 --> 19:41.762
The victims turned up dead.

19:41.797 --> 19:44.031
Now, Grace, we cannot presume anything.

19:44.066 --> 19:46.267
We have every reason to believe
your parents are alive,

19:46.301 --> 19:47.902
but I need you to not pay the ransom

19:47.936 --> 19:49.437
to give my team as
much time as possible.

19:49.471 --> 19:50.871
What?

19:50.906 --> 19:52.940
Wait, first, you're telling
me to get you the money,

19:52.975 --> 19:54.141
and now you're saying we can't use it?

19:54.176 --> 19:56.377
That's not what I said. I did
not say to get the money.

19:56.411 --> 19:57.778
You strongly implied it!

19:57.813 --> 20:00.114
You said you would
facilitate the payment.

20:00.148 --> 20:01.315
Those were your words.

20:01.350 --> 20:04.051
You told me that we would pay
the ransom and get them back.

20:04.086 --> 20:04.919
That's what you said.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.288
I understand that you're frustrated.

20:07.322 --> 20:10.424
But circumstances have changed.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.325
If you give them the money,

20:11.360 --> 20:12.994
you'll make it very
difficult for my team.

20:13.028 --> 20:13.995
No.

20:14.029 --> 20:15.496
I'm not gonna just sit here

20:15.530 --> 20:18.099
while some psychopath
murders my parents.

20:18.133 --> 20:21.268
I want to pay the ransom,
and I want them back.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.137
Look, I know you feel helpless.

20:23.171 --> 20:25.439
I know that you're a person of action,

20:25.474 --> 20:26.841
and right now, it feels
like the only option

20:26.875 --> 20:28.175
you have is to give them the money,

20:28.210 --> 20:29.510
but I'm telling you from experience,

20:29.544 --> 20:33.314
that is the wrong thing to do.

20:33.348 --> 20:36.350
My team is the best
in the world at this.

20:36.385 --> 20:39.186
Please.

20:39.221 --> 20:41.122
Let them do their job.

20:44.493 --> 20:48.462
So, Tripit doesn't exactly have
a wandering nomad registry,

20:48.497 --> 20:50.498
but I think I found a link
between the Carsons' abductions

20:50.532 --> 20:52.033
and the three previous kidnappings.

20:52.067 --> 20:53.701
During the three prior kidnappings,

20:53.735 --> 20:56.103
the same tribe of Tuareg
merchants was in the area.

20:56.138 --> 20:57.104
The Tuaregs...

20:57.139 --> 20:58.806
as in the "wandering
blue men of the Sahara"?

20:58.840 --> 20:59.774
The very same.

20:59.808 --> 21:01.442
Now, according to the state department,

21:01.476 --> 21:02.543
who apparently tracks
this kind of thing,

21:02.577 --> 21:04.879
the tribe is attending the mousseum

21:04.913 --> 21:06.547
of Sidi Mohammad Ma Al-ainin,

21:06.581 --> 21:08.816
an annual gathering of Tuareg tribes

21:08.850 --> 21:10.818
that happens to be in
Casablanca right now.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.859
The Tuaregs are nomadic merchants

21:18.894 --> 21:21.128
who still roam the desert by camel

21:21.163 --> 21:23.330
and set up camp wherever they go.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.466
They're famous for their silversmithing

21:25.500 --> 21:28.502
and their beautiful indigo clothing.

21:28.537 --> 21:31.305
The blue dye they use...
it rubs off on their skin,

21:31.339 --> 21:33.374
and over the years, they've
come to be known by it.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.755
Wow. You think you're
gonna get Victor Laszlo,

21:47.789 --> 21:50.324
and you end up getting
"Lawrence of Arabia".

21:50.358 --> 21:52.193
Yeah, the Tuaregs...

21:52.227 --> 21:55.029
they still live like they
did 1,000 years ago.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.497
My god, look at this place.

21:56.531 --> 21:59.366
400 grand would last a
lifetime in a world like this.

21:59.401 --> 22:02.403
Still, they have to be
spending it on something.

22:02.437 --> 22:03.637
Let's find out what.

22:05.307 --> 22:07.208
So, you want that we should ransack it?

22:07.242 --> 22:10.211
Let's try some diplomacy first.

22:10.245 --> 22:12.213
See how far talking gets us.

22:12.247 --> 22:13.581
It's up to you.

22:13.615 --> 22:15.750
You think they're keeping
the Carsons here?

22:15.784 --> 22:18.352
I doubt it. This
camp is wide open.

22:18.386 --> 22:20.621
It'd be tough to get
hostages in and out of here

22:20.655 --> 22:22.757
without the entire
tribe being in on it.

22:22.791 --> 22:23.624
These are filthy people.

22:23.658 --> 22:25.593
I would be surprised if they weren't.

22:25.627 --> 22:27.528
This guy.

22:27.562 --> 22:29.396
So...

22:29.431 --> 22:31.365
We're looking for a small group

22:31.399 --> 22:33.467
that's educated and technological.

22:33.502 --> 22:34.502
Yeah, you see a lot of places

22:34.536 --> 22:36.570
with a high-speed Internet
connection around here?

22:36.605 --> 22:39.540
Even if the kidnappers aren't here,

22:39.574 --> 22:41.208
we know this is their group,

22:41.243 --> 22:43.310
so somebody here knows who they are.

22:48.917 --> 22:51.619
Just keep your men back.

22:51.653 --> 22:52.720
Let's go make friends.

22:56.324 --> 22:58.225
Alpha males everywhere we go.

22:58.260 --> 23:00.427
Yeah, it's the way of the world.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.997
Yeah, well, at least this time
they're working to our benefit.

23:03.031 --> 23:05.633
Yeah, if Jack can keep the boys busy.

23:06.535 --> 23:08.068
You've come a long way, friend.

23:08.103 --> 23:10.638
We appreciate your hospitality.

23:10.672 --> 23:11.505
It's always my pleasure

23:11.540 --> 23:13.474
to welcome new visitors to our camp.

23:13.508 --> 23:15.776
I'm afraid I come with troubling news.

23:15.811 --> 23:19.613
We believe some members of
your flock may have strayed.

23:19.648 --> 23:23.417
We think a group of men may
have kidnapped some Americans.

23:33.361 --> 23:34.562
Please.

23:34.596 --> 23:37.865
Tell me of these men you seek
so I can see if I can help.

23:37.899 --> 23:41.135
We believe there are
maybe three or four,

23:41.169 --> 23:43.938
possibly a family, who are
in dire need of money.

23:43.972 --> 23:46.774
That could describe any
family in this camp.

23:46.808 --> 23:49.710
Certainly you don't mean
to accuse my entire tribe.

23:49.744 --> 23:52.112
Of course not. That
wasn't my intention.

23:52.147 --> 23:54.648
These men... have become deadly.

23:56.551 --> 23:58.118
My men are deadly.

24:02.357 --> 24:05.459
We think they're abducting
men and women to kill them

24:05.493 --> 24:07.494
and steal their family's wealth.

24:07.529 --> 24:10.564
That, my men would not do.

24:10.599 --> 24:12.700
- Matri-lineal?
- Yeah.

24:12.734 --> 24:14.034
In the Tuareg culture,

24:14.069 --> 24:16.470
power is passed down
the maternal lines.

24:16.504 --> 24:17.605
Women are the property owners,

24:17.639 --> 24:20.474
and the leadership is not
passed from chieftain to son,

24:20.508 --> 24:22.509
but to the eldest male
child of his sister.

24:22.544 --> 24:23.310
So Daddy's in charge,

24:23.345 --> 24:24.845
but Mommy still pulls the strings.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.847
Yeah.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.916
Are we gonna scrap?

24:30.285 --> 24:31.552
My neighborhood, you
take off your earrings

24:31.586 --> 24:32.720
and you're ready to throw down.

24:32.754 --> 24:34.021
You are from Greenwich, Connecticut.

24:34.055 --> 24:35.055
Yeah, well...

24:41.263 --> 24:42.696
_

24:42.731 --> 24:43.797
Welcome.

24:47.068 --> 24:48.569
I was wondering if we could talk.

24:54.042 --> 24:57.011
As you can see, we have
everything we could need.

24:57.045 --> 24:59.013
The Tuareg life is simple.

24:59.047 --> 25:01.782
We desire not for the
indulgence of this world.

25:01.816 --> 25:04.518
What about computers or education?

25:04.552 --> 25:05.519
We have no need.

25:05.553 --> 25:08.522
Our young are taught
what they need to know.

25:08.556 --> 25:10.624
The children learn to read and write.

25:10.659 --> 25:13.627
What if somebody wanted a
more formal schooling?

25:13.662 --> 25:14.495
We are an open people.

25:14.529 --> 25:17.131
Some have been known to leave the camp

25:17.165 --> 25:18.699
and pursue an education.

25:18.733 --> 25:19.500
How do they pay for that?

25:19.534 --> 25:22.069
We are not without some resources.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.638
Families share.

25:24.673 --> 25:27.107
Mr. Jack.

25:27.142 --> 25:31.045
Your people tell us that we are poor,

25:31.079 --> 25:34.448
and they tell us that
money can bring hope.

25:34.482 --> 25:36.050
Is it any surprise to you

25:36.084 --> 25:39.720
that men would do terrible
things in the name of hope?

25:43.458 --> 25:45.559
So you do know who these men are.

25:45.593 --> 25:46.560
Let us assume for a moment

25:46.594 --> 25:49.396
that someone from my camp
committed the crimes

25:49.431 --> 25:50.497
of which you speak.

25:50.532 --> 25:52.466
I can assure you they will be found

25:52.500 --> 25:54.068
and they will be dealt with.

25:54.102 --> 25:58.072
The Carsons don't have time
to wait for tribal justice.

25:58.106 --> 25:59.473
I mean no offense,

25:59.507 --> 26:01.775
but would you mind if we
look around your camp?

26:01.810 --> 26:03.010
Of course I would mind.

26:03.044 --> 26:05.279
You want justice. I find it admirable.

26:05.313 --> 26:08.148
But you must understand
that we, as travelers,

26:08.183 --> 26:11.352
have been accused of many
crimes we did not commit.

26:11.386 --> 26:14.121
Jack, we are both leaders of men.

26:14.155 --> 26:17.591
If I allow my camp to be
searched at every accusation,

26:17.625 --> 26:20.494
how long do you think
that would remain true?

26:22.630 --> 26:25.065
Not long, I'm sure.

26:29.237 --> 26:33.307
Our tinesmegelen have provided
us with medicine for centuries.

26:33.341 --> 26:35.175
Tinesmegelen?

26:35.210 --> 26:37.845
Faith healers.

26:48.490 --> 26:51.592
Well, this is more than faith.

26:54.195 --> 26:56.130
Can you tell us about this?

26:56.164 --> 26:59.833
I'm sorry. I have said what I can.

27:04.072 --> 27:08.809
As predicted, the chieftain was
cordial but uncooperative.

27:08.843 --> 27:11.045
But he wanted us to know
the men we're looking for

27:11.079 --> 27:12.813
are part of this tribe.

27:12.847 --> 27:16.383
He said men can do terrible
things in the name of hope.

27:16.418 --> 27:17.885
Modern medicine hope?

27:20.188 --> 27:22.756
There was an empty cot
in the medical tent.

27:22.791 --> 27:23.991
Missing patient?

27:29.829 --> 27:31.275
_

27:32.466 --> 27:33.466
_

27:34.130 --> 27:35.130
_

27:35.518 --> 27:36.518
_

27:41.904 --> 27:42.904
_

27:44.349 --> 27:45.349
_

27:47.082 --> 27:48.449
He's just a boy!

27:48.483 --> 27:50.417
Do you feel powerful
when you hit a child?

27:50.452 --> 27:52.953
You're no man, you coward!

27:52.987 --> 27:54.321
Peter! No.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.425
Stop it! You're hurting him!

27:59.994 --> 28:03.764
Please! Please! Don't!

28:10.805 --> 28:13.140
Take him to the desert and kill him.

28:13.174 --> 28:15.042
Show them we mean business.

28:15.076 --> 28:17.177
No!

28:17.265 --> 28:18.265
_

28:19.556 --> 28:20.556
_

28:21.522 --> 28:23.375
_

28:41.047 --> 28:43.733
_

29:00.554 --> 29:01.621
10 hours.

29:01.655 --> 29:03.044
If we don't find the Carsons
by the end of the day,

29:03.150 --> 29:04.199
we'll be lucky to find them at all.

29:04.441 --> 29:05.716
Okay, the piece
we found at the camp

29:05.834 --> 29:09.128
was a TG-135 precision I.V.
control valve.

29:09.162 --> 29:11.864
That's used to administer
medication to patients

29:11.899 --> 29:14.967
who have chronic conditions
like cancer or kidney failure.

29:17.337 --> 29:20.039
Long-term diseases that require
expensive medical care.

29:20.073 --> 29:22.341
If one of the kidnappers or
a family member was sick,

29:22.376 --> 29:24.176
that would explain why
they need the money.

29:24.211 --> 29:26.012
And if the disease is degenerative,

29:26.046 --> 29:28.781
it would speak to the increasing
urgency of the ransom demands.

29:30.751 --> 29:32.685
You saw that camp. It was primitive.

29:32.719 --> 29:34.453
Why would people who reject all forms

29:34.488 --> 29:36.289
of modern life turn to this?

29:36.323 --> 29:38.024
The matron said that
some of the children

29:38.058 --> 29:39.158
leave the tribe to go to school.

29:39.192 --> 29:40.259
What if one of them came back,

29:40.294 --> 29:42.361
thought they could save the
life of a family member?

29:42.396 --> 29:44.030
That would explain where the unsubs

29:44.064 --> 29:45.665
learned to use technology.

29:48.936 --> 29:50.870
Monty, see if you can
find hospital records

29:50.904 --> 29:52.571
for any members of that tribe

29:52.606 --> 29:54.340
who are receiving ongoing treatment

29:54.374 --> 29:56.375
for some type of
degenerative condition.

29:56.410 --> 29:57.543
You got a surname?

29:57.577 --> 29:59.478
The Sahara is the largest
desert on Earth.

29:59.513 --> 30:00.846
Well, let's concentrate on the ports

30:00.881 --> 30:02.081
where the previous
kidnappings occurred.

30:02.115 --> 30:02.949
And do it fast.

30:02.983 --> 30:04.684
We only have till the end of the day.

30:04.718 --> 30:06.819
Or not.

30:06.853 --> 30:09.989
Peter Carson's just turned
up at a hospital in town.

30:10.023 --> 30:11.691
He's in bad shape.

30:13.393 --> 30:16.028
Is he alive?

30:16.063 --> 30:17.997
I want to talk to him.

30:18.031 --> 30:19.565
He's in surgery now.

30:19.599 --> 30:20.933
His injuries were pretty extensive,

30:20.968 --> 30:22.768
but the doctor says he's gonna be okay.

30:22.803 --> 30:24.070
Where's my mother?

30:24.104 --> 30:25.371
We don't know.

30:25.405 --> 30:27.039
The kidnappers may still have her.

30:27.074 --> 30:28.841
That's it. We're paying.

30:28.875 --> 30:30.042
Grace. No.

30:30.077 --> 30:31.210
Your people had their chance.

30:31.244 --> 30:32.378
I'm not gonna just sit here

30:32.412 --> 30:33.913
and wait for my mom to turn up dead.

30:37.884 --> 30:39.785
Thank you.

30:39.820 --> 30:41.587
Hey, Jack. We got a problem.

30:41.621 --> 30:43.055
Family's gonna pay the ransom,

30:43.090 --> 30:44.623
so if Kate didn't escape with Peter...

30:44.658 --> 30:45.691
Peter didn't escape.

30:45.726 --> 30:48.461
He arrived here with a femur
broken in three places.

30:48.495 --> 30:50.096
The only way that Peter
got to this hospital

30:50.130 --> 30:50.863
was if someone else brought him.

30:50.897 --> 30:52.198
One of the kidnappers?

30:52.232 --> 30:53.132
Who beats a man to death's door

30:53.166 --> 30:54.767
and then takes him in
to get medical care?

30:54.801 --> 30:56.035
This doesn't fit the profile.

30:56.069 --> 30:57.970
None of the other victims were beaten.

30:58.005 --> 30:59.472
There was no indication of violence

30:59.506 --> 31:00.573
before they were killed.

31:00.607 --> 31:02.041
The beatings, the urgency...

31:02.075 --> 31:03.409
the unsubs are devolving.

31:03.443 --> 31:05.077
They're becoming emotional.

31:05.112 --> 31:08.147
The man on the phone
was cold and rational.

31:08.181 --> 31:10.316
Whoever did this has rage issues.

31:10.350 --> 31:13.552
Yet someone showed compassion
enough to take Peter in.

31:13.587 --> 31:15.488
They're no longer working in concert.

31:15.522 --> 31:17.089
There's gonna be a power struggle

31:17.124 --> 31:18.324
for control of the group.

31:18.358 --> 31:19.992
Any time we thought we had is gone.

31:20.027 --> 31:21.394
Wait a minute.

31:21.428 --> 31:22.795
Peter's watch.

31:24.631 --> 31:26.665
It's not here.

31:26.700 --> 31:28.634
Casablanca P.D. already
searched the town for it.

31:28.668 --> 31:31.070
That was before when the
unsubs were in control.

31:31.104 --> 31:33.139
A few thousand dollars wasn't
gonna get them what they needed,

31:33.173 --> 31:36.409
but now they're desperate,
losing rationality.

31:36.443 --> 31:38.277
You think they would sell it?

31:38.311 --> 31:39.979
Simmons, go to the map.

31:40.013 --> 31:41.180
Yeah.

31:41.214 --> 31:43.649
The bodies in the previous cases

31:43.683 --> 31:45.484
were all found within three kilometers

31:45.519 --> 31:46.652
of the abduction sites.

31:46.686 --> 31:48.320
Three-click radius from the bazaar.

31:48.355 --> 31:51.123
Not much of a comfort zone,
but the hospital fits inside.

31:51.158 --> 31:52.658
Now, between the
hospital and the bazaar,

31:52.692 --> 31:54.894
where can you unload a $6,000 watch?

31:56.329 --> 31:59.098
You mean like a jewelry district?

32:04.171 --> 32:05.471
Well...

32:05.505 --> 32:07.173
Jewelry store owner said a kid came by

32:07.207 --> 32:08.407
and hawked it this afternoon.

32:08.442 --> 32:11.277
Said he came from the docks in a
truck filled with blue cloth.

32:11.311 --> 32:13.145
Of course. The Tuaregs.

32:13.180 --> 32:14.880
They're... they're traveling merchants.

32:14.915 --> 32:16.682
That's the one thing we
didn't see at the camp.

32:16.716 --> 32:18.017
We were looking for the kidnappers,

32:18.051 --> 32:19.718
not where they keep their merchandise.

32:19.753 --> 32:21.087
That's it.

32:23.523 --> 32:24.857
Hey, Monty.

32:24.891 --> 32:26.058
We need a record search

32:26.093 --> 32:27.893
for warehouse leases near the port.

32:27.928 --> 32:30.563
Looking for a short-term rental
the Tuaregs may be using

32:30.597 --> 32:32.465
to store their wares for the festival.

33:06.788 --> 33:07.788
_

33:09.742 --> 33:10.742
_

33:42.631 --> 33:44.834
_

33:45.838 --> 33:47.560
_

33:50.610 --> 33:51.610
_

34:02.775 --> 34:04.573
_

34:04.703 --> 34:06.857
_

34:07.160 --> 34:08.561
Please, don't hurt me.

34:08.570 --> 34:09.570
_

34:13.024 --> 34:15.190
Uh, northwest corner of the block.

34:15.226 --> 34:17.127
Tuaregs rented a warehouse for
the duration of the festival.

34:17.161 --> 34:18.061
Copy.

34:37.295 --> 34:38.562
There's still a hostage inside.

34:38.597 --> 34:39.630
No one moves without my signal.

34:43.935 --> 34:45.135
Got eyes on.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.089
_

34:48.929 --> 34:50.821
_

34:51.346 --> 34:52.346
_

34:59.951 --> 35:01.485
Tell your men to back off.

35:01.519 --> 35:02.953
Let her go, Ben.

35:02.988 --> 35:04.955
We'll kill her. I swear it.

35:04.990 --> 35:06.590
I know you will.

35:06.625 --> 35:08.125
I know about the others.

35:09.027 --> 35:12.463
You're too smart for this, Ben.
Think about it.

35:12.497 --> 35:14.531
You shoot the hostage, we're coming in.

35:16.635 --> 35:19.236
We got three kidnappers. The
big one's got a gun on Kate.

35:28.413 --> 35:30.114
Jack, don't go in there.

35:30.148 --> 35:31.448
Damn it.

35:48.733 --> 35:52.036
You shoot me, they'll come
through that door and kill you.

35:52.070 --> 35:54.204
We all want the same thing...

35:54.239 --> 35:56.240
for everyone to come out of this alive.

35:56.274 --> 35:58.776
You don't want to see your
brothers get hurt, now, do you?

36:00.679 --> 36:03.314
Let her go.

36:03.348 --> 36:05.382
This is about your mother, isn't it?

36:05.417 --> 36:08.485
That's what the money's for
so you can take care of her.

36:08.520 --> 36:11.855
What do you care? No one
cared when she got sick!

36:11.890 --> 36:13.724
Let the woman go, and I'll see to it

36:13.758 --> 36:15.159
that your mother is cared for.

36:16.628 --> 36:18.262
American hospitals the best.

36:18.296 --> 36:19.763
It's too late.

36:19.798 --> 36:22.499
The cancer... there's
nothing we can do.

36:22.534 --> 36:23.934
There is still time!

36:23.969 --> 36:25.536
You heard the doctor.

36:25.570 --> 36:27.037
One more surgery.

36:27.072 --> 36:28.939
One more time and she will be fine!

36:28.974 --> 36:30.674
No, brother! Medicine is not magic!

36:30.709 --> 36:32.576
He took our money. He
gave us false hope,

36:32.610 --> 36:34.411
and now there is nothing we can do.

36:34.446 --> 36:35.379
She is going to die.

36:35.413 --> 36:36.714
They got nothing to lose.

36:36.748 --> 36:38.782
That woman has a family.

36:38.817 --> 36:42.353
If you kill her, you'll
be causing her family

36:42.387 --> 36:45.356
the same pain that you and your
brothers are trying to avoid.

36:45.705 --> 36:46.705
_

36:48.360 --> 36:50.427
We have a division. The
big one's losing control.

36:50.462 --> 36:52.730
Ben. You have to be the peacemaker.

36:52.764 --> 36:54.598
You're the only one that
can save your family here.

36:59.738 --> 37:00.738
_

37:02.826 --> 37:03.826
_

37:06.463 --> 37:07.463
_

37:08.163 --> 37:09.163
_

37:10.330 --> 37:11.330
_

37:11.804 --> 37:12.804
_

37:15.453 --> 37:16.653
Hands up, Ben!

37:16.688 --> 37:18.389
Shots fired! Shots fired!

37:18.423 --> 37:20.224
Kidnapper down. Secure the hostages.

37:20.258 --> 37:22.826
Agents are okay. We have control.

37:22.861 --> 37:23.527
On your knees!

37:26.798 --> 37:27.765
Clear.

38:12.477 --> 38:14.778
I'm sorry for your loss.

38:14.813 --> 38:17.614
And I thank you for
respecting our traditions.

38:17.649 --> 38:19.349
I will see he receives a proper burial

38:19.384 --> 38:20.851
so his soul does not linger.

38:20.885 --> 38:23.854
Even the misguided
deserve peace in death.

38:23.888 --> 38:26.156
What will happen with his brother?

38:26.191 --> 38:29.193
- He will be punished.
- As it should be.

38:29.227 --> 38:34.531
We know this was the work
of desperate brothers.

38:34.566 --> 38:36.667
Your tribe bears no responsibility

38:36.701 --> 38:38.368
or shame for their actions.

38:38.403 --> 38:40.871
To the contrary, friend.

38:40.905 --> 38:44.708
We are all responsible
for our brethren.

38:48.213 --> 38:50.747
Thank you for returning
the woman and her son.

38:50.782 --> 38:53.450
She deserves to die with her tribe.

38:56.521 --> 38:58.856
- The boy?
- He was brave.

38:58.890 --> 39:01.925
He saved two hostages' lives.

39:01.960 --> 39:05.429
The authorities have
agreed not to prosecute.

39:05.463 --> 39:08.165
We will see that he is
well taken care of.

39:18.076 --> 39:19.943
I think you may want this.

39:19.978 --> 39:21.211
Maybe next time

39:21.246 --> 39:23.080
we'll leave the good jewelry at home.

39:23.114 --> 39:25.082
There will be a next time?

39:25.116 --> 39:28.085
Let's take it one step at a time, okay?

39:28.119 --> 39:29.786
And please do let us now.

39:29.821 --> 39:32.022
The I.R.T. has many
friends around the world.

39:32.056 --> 39:34.424
We'd be happy to make
some calls to make sure

39:34.459 --> 39:36.960
that you have a better
experience next time around.

39:36.995 --> 39:38.061
Thank you.

39:38.096 --> 39:40.330
And, uh, thank you.

39:42.600 --> 39:44.801
It's all in a day's work.

39:44.836 --> 39:46.036
Now let's go home.

39:53.611 --> 39:57.714
âª These bags are carry-on âª

39:57.749 --> 40:01.818
âª and filled with many things âª

40:01.853 --> 40:07.891
âª like songs you taught me
on rusty guitar strings âª

40:09.360 --> 40:11.762
Oh, Dad.

40:15.133 --> 40:19.269
Now, there's about $400,000
worth of Bitcoin here.

40:19.304 --> 40:21.138
You might want to hang on to it.

40:21.172 --> 40:22.940
Thank you.

40:22.974 --> 40:25.809
- And I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
- It's okay.

40:25.843 --> 40:27.811
This is what we do.

40:37.455 --> 40:41.658
âª Hold on tight âª

40:41.693 --> 40:43.126
I missed you.

40:43.161 --> 40:45.295
I missed you, too.

40:46.798 --> 40:50.367
âª Are we all right? Let's pretend âª

40:50.401 --> 40:52.436
How was your trip?

40:52.470 --> 40:54.004
Everything worked out.

40:54.038 --> 40:56.173
How are the boys? They still fighting?

40:56.207 --> 41:00.811
Um, they've been inseparable
since you left.

41:05.049 --> 41:07.017
You know they take care of each other

41:07.051 --> 41:08.118
when you're gone, right?

41:08.152 --> 41:09.953
Yeah.

41:09.988 --> 41:11.755
Of course they do.

41:13.925 --> 41:15.792
They're brothers.

41:18.329 --> 41:22.366
âª Hold on tight âª
