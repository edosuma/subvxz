CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:25.240 --> 00:26.800
Hello!

00:26.800 --> 00:28.800
And welcome to Top Gear.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.720
Tonight, we've got
Chris Harris and Sabine Schmitz

00:31.720 --> 00:33.680
in a motorsports fight to the death.

00:33.680 --> 00:37.280
And we've got Eddie Jordan,
in a surprisingly-tight race suit.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.600
Something for everyone.

00:38.600 --> 00:42.560
But first, I want to talk
about American stereotypes,

00:42.560 --> 00:47.080
because some people will tell you
that America doesn't do supercars.

00:47.080 --> 00:51.120
And I have to say
that is completely and totally...

00:51.120 --> 00:52.440
true, actually.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.080
Over the years, America's
made a lot of fast cars -

00:55.080 --> 00:57.680
Corvettes, Mustangs, Vipers -

00:57.680 --> 01:00.800
but we've always tended to leave
the mid-engined supercar thing

01:00.800 --> 01:02.640
to the Europeans.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.680
Well, watch out, Europe,

01:04.680 --> 01:06.960
because America's coming to git ya!

01:10.080 --> 01:12.600
This is the new Ford GT.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.720
Yes, it's American.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.360
Yes, it's a car.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.400
And, yes, it is super.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.920
And for starters, it looks great!

01:24.960 --> 01:26.160
In fact,

01:26.160 --> 01:28.960
I think it's the best-looking
American car this century.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.720
Hell, it might just be
the best-looking car this century.

01:42.040 --> 01:44.520
Not only does it look
like a proper supercar,

01:44.520 --> 01:47.440
the GT is made out
of proper supercar parts.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.400
This isn't some lump of iron
forged by a blacksmith.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.160
No, no. This is the real deal.

01:56.840 --> 02:00.760
It's got sophisticated
pushrod hydraulic suspension,

02:00.760 --> 02:03.480
a whipcrack double-clutch gearbox.

02:03.480 --> 02:08.120
Practically the whole thing is made
out of carbon fibre and aluminum.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.280
That's right, ALUMINUM.

02:10.280 --> 02:12.840
It's an American car
and we're in America,

02:12.840 --> 02:14.120
so it's aluminum.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.840
And all those cutting-edge
components are needed

02:19.840 --> 02:23.280
to manage 647 horsepower.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.120
That is Major League.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.560
Major League enough
to do 0-60 in three seconds flat.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.960
That's as quick as the Ferrari 488.

02:30.960 --> 02:34.200
That's as quick
as the McLaren 675 LT.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.920
That's as quick as...

02:35.920 --> 02:36.960
Well, that's quick.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.080
So it's got supercar acceleration,

02:41.080 --> 02:45.240
but those cars
both top out at 205mph,

02:45.240 --> 02:47.440
which is REALLY fast.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.160
The Ford GT, however...

02:52.240 --> 02:54.800
..216mph.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.400
It's the fastest Ford ever.

02:57.400 --> 03:01.280
REVVING

03:05.840 --> 03:09.240
Now, that kind of firepower
demands closer inspection.

03:09.240 --> 03:12.880
And that means no more
Pacific Coast Highway.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.840
RADIO:

03:14.840 --> 03:17.680
What's that? I can't hear you.
I'm going through a tunnel!

03:17.680 --> 03:18.720
HE CHUCKLES

03:20.640 --> 03:23.440
No, the Ford GT needs a racetrack.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.760
Specifically,
my favourite racetrack...

03:27.760 --> 03:29.200
Laguna Seca.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.600
All right.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.880
Let's see what it can do.
So we put it in track mode.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.040
Hoh!

03:45.040 --> 03:47.120
That's nice.
Drops down with authority.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.520
All right. Ready? Here we go.

03:52.760 --> 03:57.720
Oh, the acceleration
is... enormous! Whoo!

04:02.400 --> 04:07.040
Ford have done some clever stuff
with software and fuel injection,

04:07.040 --> 04:09.080
which they say eliminates turbo lag.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.920
They keep the turbo spooled up, even
when my foot is off the throttle.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.320
So there's always power.

04:16.320 --> 04:17.440
ALWAYS!

04:20.440 --> 04:23.160
And there's plenty of grip, too.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.320
It's got an active wing out the back

04:26.320 --> 04:28.360
that keeps the back
stuck to the track.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.480
And it's got active flaps
under the nose

04:30.480 --> 04:33.240
to keep the nose stuck to the track.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.680
You stick all that together
and this thing is...

04:36.920 --> 04:37.960
..sticky.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.920
OK, here we come
into the Corkscrew at...

04:41.920 --> 04:43.960
- Ooh, - BLEEP! - That's quick.

04:48.760 --> 04:52.480
If you were to do that
through the Corkscrew at that speed

04:52.480 --> 04:54.680
in any other Ford - ever! -

04:54.680 --> 04:57.240
you would be out there in the weeds.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.600
And that's the thing
about this new GT.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.520
It's not like any other Ford, ever.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.520
See, here's what happens
when a big company like Ford

05:09.520 --> 05:11.200
tries to do a supercar.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.800
The designers come up
with a gorgeous, sleek concept,

05:14.800 --> 05:16.600
the engineers try to figure out

05:16.600 --> 05:18.880
a way to make it go
really, really fast

05:18.880 --> 05:22.200
and, then,
the departments get involved.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.960
There's the guy from
the Cup-Holders Department,

05:24.960 --> 05:28.560
who wants to make sure there's room
for his 30-ounce Big Slurp.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.120
Then there's the guy

05:30.120 --> 05:33.120
from the Sports And Leisure
Luggage Department,

05:33.120 --> 05:37.120
who wants to make sure
there's room for his golf sticks.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.080
And then there's the guy from the
Making Sure Fat Guys Fit Department,

05:41.080 --> 05:44.640
who wants to make sure
there's room for his...

05:44.640 --> 05:46.240
..fat guy.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.760
Now, after all their demands
have been met,

05:48.760 --> 05:50.760
you don't have a supercar any more.

05:50.760 --> 05:53.720
No, no, no. What you have...

05:53.720 --> 05:54.920
is an SUV.

05:58.840 --> 06:02.520
But the GT feels like
it's been crafted by specialists,

06:02.520 --> 06:05.880
who knew exactly what they wanted...

06:05.880 --> 06:07.080
and got it.

06:08.600 --> 06:13.360
Now, this is hydraulic steering.
No fancy electric. It's old school.

06:13.360 --> 06:16.280
It's got a great feel.
Turns in really sharp.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.680
TYRES SQUEAL

06:18.680 --> 06:22.760
Ferrari give you a lot of software
to help you do neater skids,

06:22.760 --> 06:24.600
but there's none of that here.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.120
In this one, you're on your own.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.560
TYRES SCREECH

06:30.120 --> 06:31.760
All on your own!

06:38.320 --> 06:40.760
Oh, my God, the balance is epic!

06:43.400 --> 06:44.640
LAUGHING: Wow!

06:44.640 --> 06:47.680
America can't do supercars?!

06:47.680 --> 06:49.200
Not from where I'm sitting.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.240
So, come on, what's not to like?

06:55.800 --> 06:57.280
Well, there is that motor.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.840
Yeah, it's big on power,

06:58.840 --> 07:02.160
but, by supercar standards,
it's kind of short on cylinders.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.360
This is a V6 -

07:06.360 --> 07:10.680
a 3.5-litre EcoBoost V6,
to be exact.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.440
And that could be a problem.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.960
Because this car
is inspired by the GT40,

07:21.960 --> 07:24.920
the greatest American
race car of all time,

07:24.920 --> 07:29.200
powered by one
of the most iconic V8s ever.

07:31.120 --> 07:35.880
Created in the 1960s, its aim
was to end Ferrari's domination

07:35.880 --> 07:37.920
at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.760
Up against Ferrari's
highly-strung V12s,

07:41.760 --> 07:45.120
Ford used the reliable brawn
of a seven-litre V8.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.240
It worked.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.800
The GT40 didn't just become
the first American car

07:49.800 --> 07:51.200
to win at Le Mans -

07:51.200 --> 07:54.640
it went one, two, three
and locked out the podium.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.920
Ferrari were humiliated.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.960
They'd never win Le Mans again.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.560
Now, listen to the internet
and the internet will tell you

08:05.560 --> 08:10.480
that Ford ditching the V8
in the new GT isn't just misguided,

08:10.480 --> 08:12.240
it's unpatriotic.

08:13.520 --> 08:17.600
But the original GT40 didn't
have a V8 because it was American -

08:17.600 --> 08:20.480
it had a V8 because it was
the right tool for the job.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.280
And so is this new V6.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.680
Yeah, sure,
Ford could have stuck a V8 in here,

08:25.680 --> 08:28.160
but that would have made the car
heavier, bigger,

08:28.160 --> 08:30.080
less aerodynamic, less agile.

08:32.440 --> 08:35.960
It's just got such a balanced feel.
So well sorted. It's just...

08:35.960 --> 08:37.159
RADIO:

08:38.480 --> 08:40.600
I still have half a tank of fuel!

08:42.400 --> 08:43.440
Bunch of...

08:47.080 --> 08:52.400
As I was saying, the new GT doesn't
honour its history by being retro -

08:52.400 --> 08:55.240
it honours its history
by being quick.

08:55.240 --> 08:59.400
Last year, exactly half a century
after the original GT40

08:59.400 --> 09:03.240
spanked Ferrari at Le Mans,
this new GT won its class

09:03.240 --> 09:05.880
in a 24-hour race
and beat Ferrari again.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.880
What are you going to do?

09:10.600 --> 09:13.240
This car is SO special.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.480
Maybe it's the history,
maybe it's the pedigree.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.560
You know what? I'm just
going to shut up now.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.600
I'm just...

09:22.640 --> 09:24.000
Yeah.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.880
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

09:51.880 --> 09:53.160
Pretty special.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.520
- OK.
- Pretty special, right?

09:57.680 --> 10:01.000
This car looks absolutely
stunning in that film,

10:01.000 --> 10:02.760
but I can't believe
I am saying this,

10:02.760 --> 10:04.960
it looks even better
in the studio, in the flesh.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.880
- The way you see those scalloped sides.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:07.880 --> 10:11.840
When we did the film, I had seen
photos, but when I saw it in person

10:11.840 --> 10:15.080
the first time, I just walked
around and around and around it.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.400
It is so good looking.

10:16.400 --> 10:20.000
It's a great piece of styling
and you were the first person,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.960
- outside the factory, to drive it.
- Er, right, yeah.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.200
Well, apart from the guy
who backed it off the truck

10:25.200 --> 10:28.720
on the Pacific Coast Highway.
He was technically the first,

10:28.720 --> 10:31.720
but then it was...
then it was little ol' me.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.240
I'm profoundly jealous.
I love driving cars first, Matthew.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.760
- You've taken over my role. I'm gutted.
- Whoa, whoa, hold on.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.960
You get to drive everything.
You drove the Ferrari FXX-K,

10:39.960 --> 10:43.880
you drove the Bugatti Chiron,
you drove the Volvo Estate

10:43.880 --> 10:46.880
in Kazakhstan. Come on, now.
You need to learn to share.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.280
You can't have them all.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.280
In this instance,
I can say that's fine.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.080
But one thing.
You didn't mention the price.

10:53.080 --> 10:57.560
Ah. No, I didn't,
because it is very expensive!

10:57.560 --> 11:02.360
It's about $400,000. About
£300,000. That's a lot of money.

11:02.360 --> 11:07.120
That's more than a 675LT,
more than a Ferrari 488.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.240
Enough to support

11:08.240 --> 11:10.600
this rather ordinary badge here?

11:10.600 --> 11:13.800
Yeah. I mean,
it's a better supercar.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.840
So because it is more expensive,
it's better?

11:15.840 --> 11:17.720
Yeah. Yeah.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.640
Yeah. Look, for too long now,
America has been making cars

11:21.640 --> 11:23.360
that are good value for the money.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.480
They give you a lot of bang
for your buck.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.680
But that's
where we've been going wrong.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.400
Supercars aren't about
bang for your buck.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.640
You make it stupid expensive

11:31.640 --> 11:33.800
and people just
can't get enough of it.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.640
There's some logic in that.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.400
Can I ask one thing?
When you did the lowering...

11:38.400 --> 11:40.520
When you put it in track mode
and it... WHOOMPH!

11:40.520 --> 11:41.960
Please can I, um...? Come on.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.920
All right. Go on, have a go.
Here you go.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.480
- Watch this. This is great.
- You would, wouldn't you!

11:47.480 --> 11:48.520
- ALL: Yes!

11:48.520 --> 11:50.160
You would. Watch this.

11:51.640 --> 11:53.560
This is the coolest thing.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.120
ENGINE EMITS LOW ROAR

11:57.120 --> 11:58.720
Oh!

12:01.040 --> 12:03.400
CHRIS CACKLES

12:03.400 --> 12:05.920
That is just awesome!

12:05.920 --> 12:07.360
And wait for it.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.720
Watch it go back up.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.480
Nice. That's fantastic.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.480
How do you get out?

12:19.480 --> 12:21.160
LAUGHTER

12:21.160 --> 12:24.280
Right. Well, while he figures
that out - Rory!

12:24.280 --> 12:28.560
And, really, it doesn't actually
matter how much the Ford GT costs,

12:28.560 --> 12:30.800
because they're only planning
to make 1,000 of them

12:30.800 --> 12:33.600
and they're sold out ten times over.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.480
- Unlucky.
- That's right, unlucky.

12:36.480 --> 12:40.160
All right. Now, it's time
to welcome this week's guest.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.920
That's right.
He's won six Olympic gold medals.

12:43.920 --> 12:46.800
He's one of the fastest men
ever on two wheels

12:46.800 --> 12:51.640
and his legs make more torque
than a Ferrari F12.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.400
Please welcome Sir Chris Hoy.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

13:01.560 --> 13:04.840
How you doing, mate?
Hi, Matt, How's it going?

13:04.840 --> 13:07.160
- Welcome.
- Thank you. Hi, Rory. Thank you.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.960
Wow!

13:11.960 --> 13:13.520
This is exciting, isn't it?

13:14.880 --> 13:18.640
- That is a nice... That is a nice welcome, yeah.
- Fantastic.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.840
- So...
- Great to be here.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.800
..over 500 pound-feet
of torque in those legs?

13:21.800 --> 13:25.480
- 700 newton metres, whatever that is in the old...
- That's a lot.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.640
It's quite a lot.
Less now. I'm retired now.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.040
- Less?
- It's like a vintage car, loses power over the years.
- Got you.

13:31.040 --> 13:34.040
So maybe human figures
by this point, you think?

13:34.040 --> 13:36.680
Yeah, it's been a while since
I've tested them, but who knows?

13:36.680 --> 13:39.240
And you love your cars. What did
you drive down here in today?

13:39.240 --> 13:44.120
I drove down in an RS6 Estate.
Nice family car. Quite sensible.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.760
I hear it's been breathed on
just a little?

13:46.760 --> 13:48.520
A little bit.
It's got a loud exhaust

13:48.520 --> 13:51.480
and maybe a few little
extra horses in there.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.960
- But it's...
- It has 730 horsepower, dude.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.440
Yeah, well, you need them,
don't you? You need them.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.520
LAUGHTER

13:57.520 --> 14:00.480
Now, last year, you did something
I've always wanted to do -

14:00.480 --> 14:03.080
you raced at
the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

14:03.080 --> 14:07.000
Oh, it was unbelievable. Just
incredible. An amazing experience.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.680
It exceeded everything,
on every level,

14:08.680 --> 14:11.320
that I was looking forward to,
getting into it.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.760
Yeah, a huge amount of fun.

14:12.760 --> 14:15.400
Now, a couple of years ago,
you drove a Nissan GTR

14:15.400 --> 14:18.160
at the Goodwood Festival of Speed,
didn't you?

14:18.160 --> 14:20.120
How did that go?
You know what? We have a clip.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.480
- I knew you would bring this up!
- Let's look at this tape here.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.760
Nice. There we go.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.080
SCREECHING

14:29.080 --> 14:30.680
Oh!

14:31.920 --> 14:34.000
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

14:34.000 --> 14:35.960
Thanks for reminding me
about that one(!)

14:35.960 --> 14:37.520
I love the bow at the end!

14:37.520 --> 14:40.600
Well, you know, I sat in the car
afterwards and I just thought,

14:40.600 --> 14:42.840
"I wonder,
if I wait here long enough,

14:42.840 --> 14:44.240
"they might all just go home."

14:44.240 --> 14:45.960
Oh, horrendous.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.400
There's a corner called Molecomb,
it's a left-hander,

14:48.400 --> 14:50.200
and they all told me,
before I got there,

14:50.200 --> 14:52.120
"If you can see the corner,
or if you wait to brake

14:52.120 --> 14:53.840
"before you see the corner,
it's too late."

14:53.840 --> 14:55.640
I remember going
over the crest of the hill,

14:55.640 --> 14:59.920
seeing the corner, still flat,
and I thought, "Uh-oh."

14:59.920 --> 15:03.120
- You were committed, certainly.
- It was full commitment.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.400
At least I was...
I wasn't holding back.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.160
The worst thing was...
Not the worst thing,

15:08.160 --> 15:11.600
but one of the bad things
was it was the CEO,

15:11.600 --> 15:15.160
Andy Palmer's personal car, one of
only two NISMO GT-Rs in the country,

15:15.160 --> 15:17.960
brand-new,
he hadn't even driven it yet.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.320
And...

15:19.320 --> 15:21.400
- Nor would he ever!
- Well, exactly.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.400
I saw him after
I got out of the car,

15:23.400 --> 15:25.480
and he was very good about it,
he said,

15:25.480 --> 15:27.640
"We can replace cars,
we can't replace people."

15:27.640 --> 15:29.440
He was quite happy,
because it showed

15:29.440 --> 15:31.440
how great the airbags
and the safety was.

15:31.440 --> 15:34.640
I went through four rows of
hay bales and came out unscathed.

15:34.640 --> 15:37.040
So you've raced at Le Mans.
What's next?

15:37.040 --> 15:41.120
I'm aiming to be the first person
to cycle across Antarctica.

15:41.120 --> 15:44.440
And also cycle to the South Pole
on the way to doing that.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.520
It's something
I never thought I'd do,

15:46.520 --> 15:49.800
it's completely out there,
quite a strange challenge,

15:49.800 --> 15:51.160
but it's a huge challenge,

15:51.160 --> 15:54.040
and to be the first person
to do that would be pretty cool.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.840
Hmm.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.560
That killed the conversation,
didn't it?

15:57.560 --> 15:59.680
LAUGHTER
No, no, I'm just...

15:59.680 --> 16:01.520
No, I think that's...

16:01.520 --> 16:02.760
Why would you do that?

16:02.760 --> 16:04.680
Why would I do it? Well...

16:04.680 --> 16:07.520
You know, it's not one of these
places you go to on holiday.

16:07.520 --> 16:08.560
No, you don't.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.200
You're not going to end up
at the South Pole by accident.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.040
I just, I like to do things
that challenge me, that push me.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.280
And to go somewhere
that I never thought

16:16.280 --> 16:18.680
I would ever get the chance to do,
or to go to,

16:18.680 --> 16:21.760
and to challenge myself in a way
I've never been challenged before.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.840
But, yeah, it's just...
Why not? I suppose is the answer.

16:24.840 --> 16:27.360
Is that something
you're going to do by yourself?

16:27.360 --> 16:28.760
No, we're trying to find somebody

16:28.760 --> 16:30.760
- that's stupid enough to do it with me.
- Good luck!

16:30.760 --> 16:33.640
We're chatting to
a few people just now.

16:33.640 --> 16:36.600
It's a big undertaking,
it will be a lot of training,

16:36.600 --> 16:38.160
a lot of preparation.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.920
We're going to Iceland soon
to test a new bike,

16:40.920 --> 16:43.600
we will actually design and build
a new bike for this project.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.720
Going to have to be able
to deal with

16:45.720 --> 16:47.880
minus whatever the temperatures
will be out there.

16:47.880 --> 16:51.480
- Yeah.
- Apparently it's 25 degrees cooler at the South Pole

16:51.480 --> 16:54.480
- than it is in Iceland, which is pretty cold already.
- Whoa.

16:54.480 --> 16:58.160
Maybe put a cab around it
and a motor, call it a truck!

16:58.160 --> 16:59.520
LAUGHTER

16:59.520 --> 17:02.440
I'd go with you, but I've got a
thing I've got to do, I couldn't...

17:03.520 --> 17:06.880
What do you say we take a look at
your training lap with Chris Harris?

17:06.880 --> 17:08.280
How did that go out there?

17:08.280 --> 17:11.240
It was... I'm going to get
my excuses in early, I think.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.400
It was greasy, wet.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.200
Chris was very good, though,

17:15.200 --> 17:17.800
he wasn't shouting at me,
he wasn't grumpy.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.319
You're a lot bigger than him.
LAUGHTER

17:20.319 --> 17:22.960
I assume what you're aiming for
is to knock Max Whitlock

17:22.960 --> 17:25.599
off the top of the leaderboard,
right? Gold versus gold?

17:25.599 --> 17:28.560
For the pride of my sport
versus gymnastics,

17:28.560 --> 17:30.160
it'd be great to be up there.

17:30.160 --> 17:33.000
Yeah, yeah. You're a sport
that has wheels.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.480
Yeah. I've got some advantage.
He'll be...

17:35.480 --> 17:37.160
Well, he's smaller, he's lighter,

17:37.160 --> 17:39.360
he takes good instruction
from his coaches,

17:39.360 --> 17:41.560
- he can learn routines, so he should be good.
- OK.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.400
- It was a good lap he set.
- Very modest. Is that how you really feel?

17:46.680 --> 17:48.480
Let's take a look.

17:48.480 --> 17:52.000
- Forget everything else, there are two words that matter today.
- OK.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.720
"Max" and "Whitlock".

17:54.720 --> 17:55.960
You have to beat him.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.200
Yeah, but he did it in the dry.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.520
Oh, God, you're like a real
racing driver - all the excuses.

17:59.520 --> 18:00.760
Let's go! First gear.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.480
- Over to the right-hand side.
- Get in, you bugger!

18:06.480 --> 18:08.200
There's several others in there.

18:14.080 --> 18:17.000
He's showboating now!
Over to the right.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Braking hard at the hundred.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.560
- Oh, hundred?
- Third gear.
- What the hell is that?
- Third gear.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.280
A bit of pommel-horse work there.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.000
ONE PERSON APPLAUDING

18:34.920 --> 18:37.720
That is just...

18:37.720 --> 18:39.800
TEARFULLY: That is just beautiful.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.640
Oh, that...

18:43.880 --> 18:45.120
Oh!

18:46.600 --> 18:49.800
- Third gear.
- Get it in third.
- There we go. That's fifth gear.

18:49.800 --> 18:53.320
- Max didn't do that.
- Come on! Come on!
- Fourth gear.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.480
Trail it all the way in
and get the thing tippy-toed.

18:59.480 --> 19:00.920
- Carry it more...
- Yeah, yeah.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.240
Good car control, that man!

19:07.120 --> 19:10.720
Over the line! We're in.
Star pupil.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.640
- That was a bit better, that one.
- Star pupil!

19:12.640 --> 19:15.280
So you've taught me everything
you know? All the local knowledge?

19:15.280 --> 19:18.160
- Of course I have, I've told you all my tricks.
- Brilliant.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.400
HE MOUTHS

19:19.400 --> 19:22.240
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

19:22.240 --> 19:24.240
Well done, man.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.600
That looked really good, though.

19:28.600 --> 19:32.000
In those conditions,
with no distractions whatsoever...

19:33.880 --> 19:36.480
I just about locked up on the brakes
and went straight into him.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.360
- He was lucky I didn't hit him.
- Yeah!
- Could have been messy.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.560
Yeah, could have been.
Chris, what do you think?

19:41.560 --> 19:43.080
Very, very high hopes.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.200
I think he's the star pupil,
as I said in the car.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.280
He's got all the car control.

19:47.280 --> 19:51.040
If the conditions are there, I'm
expecting great things. No pressure.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.200
Thanks, mate.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.720
We'll get to your timed lap
a little bit later in the show.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.800
OK, now, moving on.
For the last few months,

19:56.800 --> 19:59.000
there's been an argument
brewing in the office -

19:59.000 --> 20:01.840
who is Top Gear's quickest driver?

20:01.840 --> 20:05.200
Well, obviously, that's The Stig,
but who's second quickest?

20:05.200 --> 20:08.440
According to racing driver
Sabine Schmitz, it's...

20:08.440 --> 20:09.560
Sabine Schmitz,

20:09.560 --> 20:12.640
and according to racing driver
Chris Harris, it's Chris Harris.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.760
So we decided to settle
the argument, once and for all.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.280
Sabine versus Chris.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.280
All we needed was a place to race.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.320
The Mojave Desert.

20:30.320 --> 20:33.440
Once a year, this Californian
wilderness is transformed

20:33.440 --> 20:36.760
into a sprawling city
of die-hard race fans.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.440
Whoo! This is what I call
a proper playground!

20:42.440 --> 20:44.440
Look at the size of it!

20:47.200 --> 20:50.280
To decide which of us is quickest,
apart from The Stig,

20:50.280 --> 20:52.920
we'd been sent to
The King Of The Hammers -

20:52.920 --> 20:56.880
one of the most-extreme
off-road events on the planet.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.760
Competing here
requires specialist skill.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.120
High-speed, low-grip racing
across desert flats

21:04.120 --> 21:06.960
meets complex technical rock crawls

21:06.960 --> 21:09.640
over near-vertical
boulder-strewn faces...

21:11.240 --> 21:13.920
..where one mistake
can mean disaster.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.560
Well, all I can say is...

21:18.560 --> 21:21.720
what a perfect place
for you to lose!

21:21.720 --> 21:24.640
What?! I'm not going to lose.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.680
Come on.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.600
Welcome to Hammer Town.

21:36.880 --> 21:41.520
35,000 fans all gathered
to watch the motorsport equivalent

21:41.520 --> 21:43.000
of cage fighting.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.520
And as if that wasn't
intimidating enough,

21:45.520 --> 21:48.880
the next morning we'd been entered
into something called

21:48.880 --> 21:50.400
the Legends Class.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.400
And we'd be driving these.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.600
That is an Ultra 4 buggy.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.040
Holy moly.

22:01.040 --> 22:05.160
Over $100,000
of custom-made 500 horsepower

22:05.160 --> 22:07.560
V8 off-roader with four-wheel drive,

22:07.560 --> 22:10.720
long travel shocks
and 40-inch tyres.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.320
One slight issue here, Sabine.

22:14.320 --> 22:15.840
- This is your vehicle.
- Yeah.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.600
There are big dents in
the roll cage, and if I just, um...

22:21.200 --> 22:24.480
Yeah, this vehicle's been
on its roof several times, Sabine.

22:24.480 --> 22:26.520
But that's standard, isn't it?

22:26.520 --> 22:28.360
- I'm not afraid.
- For you maybe, not for me.

22:28.360 --> 22:31.040
I've never rolled a racing car
in my life.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.200
I've rolled a couple.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.480
Are you not worried by this?

22:35.480 --> 22:37.560
I can't wait, actually.

22:37.560 --> 22:40.080
Don't cry, Harris, please.

22:40.080 --> 22:42.000
This is so cool!

22:42.000 --> 22:43.200
Huh?

22:46.680 --> 22:50.000
Not convinced,
I went to find some reassurance

22:50.000 --> 22:51.720
from the event organiser.

22:53.080 --> 22:57.280
- So, Dave, you are literally King of the Hammers.
- Evidently, yeah.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.280
- This is your event.
- This is my event, yeah.

22:59.280 --> 23:03.800
The million-dollar question
for me is the inversion thing.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.600
- Yeah, I heard you haven't rolled before.
- No.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.480
Today's your day.
THEY LAUGH

23:09.480 --> 23:12.280
This is going into something knowing
that you're going to get hurt.

23:12.280 --> 23:14.680
I'm not sure about this at all.
This is absolutely insane.

23:14.680 --> 23:17.440
Neither one of these guys here
finished this race last year

23:17.440 --> 23:19.520
because they both broke their backs
during the race

23:19.520 --> 23:21.680
and had to be flown out.

23:21.680 --> 23:24.160
Just drive as slow as you can.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.240
Then you're safe.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.960
Are you listening
to what he's saying?

23:26.960 --> 23:28.240
He said they broke their backs!

23:28.240 --> 23:31.720
- Given what you know about our driving background...
- Yes.

23:31.720 --> 23:35.640
..give an honest assessment
of our chances in these things.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.560
She's going to kill it,
you're not going to make it.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.640
Anybody that can drive a van
around the Nurburgring

23:40.640 --> 23:42.080
is willing to try different things.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.880
Plus I heard she's
already been upside-down,

23:43.880 --> 23:45.040
and you're worried about that.

23:45.040 --> 23:47.120
So you're gonna drive scared
and be upside-down anyway,

23:47.120 --> 23:48.400
she's going to kill it.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.240
Hmm.

23:53.760 --> 23:57.640
With Dave having been
no help whatsoever,

23:57.640 --> 24:00.800
we were given the afternoon
and a veteran driver each

24:00.800 --> 24:04.680
to familiarise ourselves
with the cars and the terrain.

24:04.680 --> 24:07.960
I had been paired with former
X Games gold medallist

24:07.960 --> 24:11.320
and legendary motivational speaker
Chris Ridgeway.

24:11.320 --> 24:13.080
You're pretty much going to be OK.

24:16.360 --> 24:21.600
While Dave had kindly offered Sabine
the help of his son, Bailey.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.320
Ready for this crazy adventure?

24:23.320 --> 24:25.080
SABINE LAUGHS

24:25.080 --> 24:29.120
I'm in a little bit better shape
than Chris.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.880
So first up were the desert flats.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.840
Sounds straightforward.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.440
Bloody hell! Whoa!

24:47.480 --> 24:48.760
That's insane!

24:49.920 --> 24:52.680
And I'm supposed
to do this myself, am I?

24:52.680 --> 24:56.200
'In my defence,
I've never been a good passenger.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.160
'But, annoyingly,
Sabine was having a blast.'

25:01.360 --> 25:03.200
Whooooo!

25:06.480 --> 25:08.000
SHE LAUGHS AND SHRIEKS

25:09.080 --> 25:10.240
Whooo!

25:13.320 --> 25:15.680
- Having a good time?
- Yes!

25:15.680 --> 25:17.920
SHE LAUGHS

25:17.920 --> 25:21.600
Soon, though, it was our turn
to take the wheel.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.480
Ah, now we're talking!

25:30.120 --> 25:33.320
This isn't like a street car
that you're used to driving.

25:33.320 --> 25:35.400
- You've got to hammer the thing.
- Yeah.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.040
You're hard on the brakes,
hard on the throttle.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.440
Full throttle, give it some gas.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.080
- OK, honey!
- Give it a little gas.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.400
ENGINE ROARS
There you go!

25:47.400 --> 25:48.680
Whoohoo!

25:52.000 --> 25:54.280
The suspension is incredible.

25:54.280 --> 25:59.120
But there is this lurking feeling
it could roll any time.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.400
That's correct.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.960
Just as I was starting to
get the hang of it, though,

26:03.960 --> 26:05.800
I asked a stupid question.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.920
Now, how many injuries have you had?

26:10.920 --> 26:12.720
I've had a few.

26:12.720 --> 26:16.480
I start with the easy stuff,
like the broken arms and legs.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.720
But, er...

26:17.720 --> 26:21.000
A rebuilt wrist,
and knees and ankles.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.480
There was that one time
I got my leg cut off.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.400
- What?!
- Yeah.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.440
Yeah, that was a bad day
at the office.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.280
Oh, my Godfather.

26:32.440 --> 26:35.840
And with that,
we made our way back to Hammer Town.

26:35.840 --> 26:39.440
Where my confidence took
another blow.

26:39.440 --> 26:43.080
I'm kind of up for anything
to do with going fast in cars,

26:43.080 --> 26:44.800
but I'm not so sure about this.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.720
I've just been ragdolled around
by some lunatic,

26:47.720 --> 26:51.400
and now I'm told that this happened
yesterday to some poor soul -

26:51.400 --> 26:52.440
electrical fire.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.440
He used the phrase,
"We barely got out."

26:55.440 --> 26:57.000
I thought that was plastic.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.440
That's aluminium, melted.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.320
Um...

27:01.320 --> 27:03.880
I think I've bitten off
more than I can chew here.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.680
'It was clear
we needed more practice.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.440
'But before we could head back out,

27:09.440 --> 27:12.280
'we were told
we'd each be getting some help

27:12.280 --> 27:13.840
'from a team manager.'

27:17.120 --> 27:20.960
- I can't have Eddie.
- I don't want Eddie!
- I don't want Eddie.

27:20.960 --> 27:23.120
I don't... I - don't want Eddie.

27:23.120 --> 27:26.200
- Hello!
- Hi!
- Welcome to the desert.
- Hi, Eddie!

27:26.200 --> 27:28.120
What a lovely surprise. Gentlemen.

27:28.120 --> 27:31.680
- Edward.
- Sabine, how are you?
- Hello!
- Nice to see you.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.240
- OK, so...
- So I must be with...

27:33.240 --> 27:35.360
- We've had a coin toss. You...
- Yeah?

27:35.360 --> 27:36.640
..are with Eddie.

27:36.640 --> 27:39.080
- Whoohoo!
- And I am with Sabine.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.360
Come on, give me a hug.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.840
Give me a hug.
Are we going to win?

27:43.840 --> 27:45.160
Yes, we're going to win.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.960
- He's nervous, isn't he?
- Guys. Here we go.

27:47.960 --> 27:51.280
- Along here, this is our line.
- That's it.
- That's fine, that's fine.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.520
This is the line in the sand
right there.

27:53.520 --> 27:56.240
- OK. Toes on the line.
- They are the enemy.

27:56.240 --> 27:59.040
- OK, I've got you, Edward. I've got you.
- You sure?
- Yeah.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.360
- So it's on?
- It's on, it's on.
- It's on.

28:04.680 --> 28:08.240
So, heading back out
to our desert training area,

28:08.240 --> 28:10.840
it was time to tackle rock crawling.

28:10.840 --> 28:14.840
And with our team managers on board,
they got straight down to business.

28:14.840 --> 28:17.720
You know what I have
a good feeling about?

28:17.720 --> 28:20.120
I am going to blank Matt LeBlanc.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.720
Ha-ha! I'm not going to speak
to him.

28:22.720 --> 28:26.640
I'm just going to eyeball him, and
I'm just going to stare into him.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.120
Stare into me?

28:28.120 --> 28:29.880
That's... creepy.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.640
Anyway, I had plans of my own.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.720
We need to try to get in
Chris Harris' head a little bit.

28:34.720 --> 28:37.880
- Ja?
- We need to try to ask him, "Are you sure you will be OK?

28:37.880 --> 28:39.720
"You sure you're going to be
all right?"

28:39.720 --> 28:42.960
- Because his confidence is easy to shatter.
- OK.
- OK?

28:44.440 --> 28:48.520
Actually, it wasn't my confidence
they needed to worry about.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.600
SABINE SHRIEKS

28:55.200 --> 28:57.200
- We got bloody stuck!
- SHE CHUCKLES

29:02.360 --> 29:05.120
What on earth
have they got themselves into?

29:05.120 --> 29:06.960
They are properly stuck.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.200
Stuck?

29:08.200 --> 29:11.360
No, no, no. This is Sabine Schmitz
we're talking about.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.560
Both sides!

29:24.200 --> 29:26.200
THEY CHEER

29:30.520 --> 29:34.160
- Ha-ha!
- Well, well, well. How was that?

29:34.160 --> 29:36.360
Did you enjoy your time
in the mountains, then?

29:36.360 --> 29:38.720
- A little bit.
- Was there a problem with the car?

29:38.720 --> 29:41.080
Well, we went the difficult way,
you went the easy way.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.600
- We traced exactly the same route as yours.
- I don't think you did.

29:43.600 --> 29:46.520
- And it's not "ROUT", it's "ROOT".
- Tell them they went a different way.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.920
Surely...
They are the king of the practice,

29:48.920 --> 29:50.480
we are the kings of the race.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.920
Let's have a beer,
I am bloody thirsty.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.960
- Nice job.
- Hanging around in the rocks.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.800
Way to go,
right around that hard section.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.800
Drive slowly and safe.

29:58.800 --> 29:59.880
I'm feeling good now.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.080
- I'm done with them...
- We've done enough today.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.360
I thought you were going
to ignore him and not talk to him.

30:04.360 --> 30:05.640
- You said...
- Oh.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.240
You've just spent ten minutes
talking to him.

30:14.920 --> 30:17.680
With our day's practice
drawing to a close,

30:17.680 --> 30:19.480
we headed back to Hammer Town

30:19.480 --> 30:23.640
and joined the thousands of fans
settling down for the night.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.680
And with the next day's race
looming even larger,

30:26.680 --> 30:29.840
Chris was a little preoccupied.

30:29.840 --> 30:35.640
There are actually at least eight
other locals in our race tomorrow

30:35.640 --> 30:38.120
and I'm looking at the runners
and riders here,

30:38.120 --> 30:39.320
they're a bit good.

30:39.320 --> 30:42.640
I think we're fighting over
penultimate and last.

30:42.640 --> 30:45.280
I feel like your confidence
is a bit shattered.

30:45.280 --> 30:47.640
You know they airlifted
four guys out of here today?

30:47.640 --> 30:50.200
- Was it four or five?
- I know what you're trying to do.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.560
What am I trying to do?

30:51.560 --> 30:54.760
I care about you, I want you to know
what you're getting into.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.280
What do you mean they airlifted
people out from here?

30:57.280 --> 31:00.120
Big wrecks. I mean, full-on...
HE WHISTLES

31:00.120 --> 31:01.880
Cartwheel wrecks, bad stuff.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.120
SABINE LAUGHS

31:03.120 --> 31:04.640
When you were managing F1 teams,

31:04.640 --> 31:08.400
was there any, like, motivational
speeches before the race,

31:08.400 --> 31:11.080
the night before,
anything you told them to do?

31:11.080 --> 31:14.200
The drivers would be sent to bed,
at the latest, ten o'clock.

31:14.200 --> 31:17.160
But prior to that,
they'd all have a massage.

31:17.160 --> 31:20.320
- Massage?
- Massage?
- A massage.

31:20.320 --> 31:21.680
What type of...?

31:23.240 --> 31:25.640
Well, I don't know -
that's between Eddie and Chris.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.560
THEY LAUGH

31:29.280 --> 31:31.200
If that's what he needs
to do for his driver,

31:31.200 --> 31:34.120
that's what he does for his driver,
it's got nothing to do with us.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.440
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

31:43.160 --> 31:47.480
All right. Now, we'll see
the second half of that film

31:47.480 --> 31:49.120
a little later on in the show.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.440
Chris, have you done
any off-road driving?

31:51.440 --> 31:52.680
Nothing like that.

31:52.680 --> 31:55.400
I did drive a Dakar rally car
a few years ago in Morocco.

31:55.400 --> 31:57.240
That was pretty cool.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.080
But I drove Colin McRae's

31:59.080 --> 32:04.640
1995 replica
World Championship-winning car

32:04.640 --> 32:07.200
about three or four years ago,

32:07.200 --> 32:11.480
on the final stage, where he won his
world title in Wales in the GB Rally

32:11.480 --> 32:13.120
and that was amazing.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.800
He's a massive, massive hero
of mine,

32:14.800 --> 32:16.480
so that was a privilege to do that.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.080
All right, guys,
have a look at this.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.680
In the studio,
we've got a brand-new car

32:20.680 --> 32:23.000
that's going to compete
in a brand-new race series

32:23.000 --> 32:26.040
that's going to make F1 look
like the Stone Age.

32:26.040 --> 32:30.320
700 horsepower, all carbon fibre,
and the best thing of all,

32:30.320 --> 32:34.000
it was designed by the same guy
who did the Tron Light Cycles.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.640
- Wow! That's really cool-looking.
- Yeah.

32:37.640 --> 32:41.400
Just one tiny... tiny question -

32:41.400 --> 32:42.920
where does the driver sit?

32:42.920 --> 32:45.600
There is no driver.
This is a Robocar.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.520
It's a self-racing racer.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.040
Basically, in a couple of years,

32:49.040 --> 32:51.440
20 of these things will be hooning
around the track,

32:51.440 --> 32:53.240
competing against each other.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.360
Robot versus robot.
How cool is that?

32:55.360 --> 32:57.080
I genuinely don't understand it,
Rory.

32:57.080 --> 32:59.760
So we're supposed to get excited
about one robot

32:59.760 --> 33:01.680
racing another robot?

33:01.680 --> 33:04.240
It's robots having a race.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.560
What do you not
understand about that?

33:06.560 --> 33:09.040
There's something fundamental
missing, dude - the driver!

33:09.040 --> 33:10.720
AUDIENCE MURMURS IN AGREEMENT

33:10.720 --> 33:12.920
We go to watch motor racing

33:12.920 --> 33:15.080
to see gladiators
controlling machines,

33:15.080 --> 33:16.600
going wheel to wheel.

33:16.600 --> 33:20.360
Not to watch one processor having
a go at another bloke called Intel.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.840
It just doesn't...
It's utterly meaningless.

33:22.840 --> 33:25.360
It's a great-looking thing
and I'm sure it's fast.

33:25.360 --> 33:26.520
What do you reckon?

33:26.520 --> 33:28.800
- Yeah, I have to agree - sorry, Rory.
- All right.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.840
I love innovation, new technology,
but it's about the human element.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.440
You have to care about the person
that's driving it.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.120
You know what you could do?

33:38.200 --> 33:39.840
You could put some jockeys on it.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.640
You know what I mean?

33:41.640 --> 33:43.160
- LAUGHING:
- Now you're talking!

33:43.160 --> 33:45.240
Could put maybe some foot pegs
back here,

33:45.240 --> 33:48.640
couple of clip-ons here,
get on the thing like this...

33:48.640 --> 33:50.400
LAUGHTER

33:50.400 --> 33:51.960
And off they go.

33:51.960 --> 33:53.240
APPLAUSE

33:54.680 --> 33:58.120
And then the last one
on the car wins.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.080
You could be the first one
to try it.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.080
You know what? I'm good, I'm good.

34:02.080 --> 34:03.640
So, over the last few weeks,

34:03.640 --> 34:06.760
I've been serving up a whole bunch
of amazing electric cars

34:06.760 --> 34:09.320
and Matt and Chris
keep batting them down

34:09.320 --> 34:11.199
because, well, they fear progress.

34:11.199 --> 34:14.400
But there's a new Nissan that
I think could change their minds

34:14.400 --> 34:17.400
and, earlier today,
I went out to meet it on our track.

34:17.400 --> 34:22.159
This is the Nissan Blade Glider
and it's an electric concept car.

34:22.159 --> 34:25.560
But here's the difference -
this one actually drives, fast.

34:25.560 --> 34:28.960
And it's got three seats,
so it's the perfect way

34:28.960 --> 34:31.800
to convert a couple of
electric car sceptics.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.639
What is, er... What is this?

34:35.639 --> 34:39.480
Gentlemen, behold the future.
What do you think?

34:39.480 --> 34:40.719
What is it?

34:40.719 --> 34:42.159
Well, it's the Blade Glider.

34:42.159 --> 34:44.880
It actually drifts -
it's got a built-in drift mode.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.199
It's made for skidding!

34:46.199 --> 34:48.480
- Really?
- That's very exciting, but looks like you'd get

34:48.480 --> 34:50.920
a grant on the NHS for it,
but other than that...

34:50.920 --> 34:53.120
- So you say it drifts?
- Want to have a go?

34:53.120 --> 34:55.880
Yes, I think we should drive it.
At least we might be drier inside.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.840
- Oh, there's no roof.
- LAUGHING: - No, there's no roof.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.960
- Now I've got your interest.
- You have.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.760
If it drifts, of course,
I'm driving, Rory, not you.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.840
- Sorry about that.
- Get in. Here we go.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.360
How the hell do you shut the door?

35:13.360 --> 35:14.760
Is there a button?

35:14.760 --> 35:16.280
THEY LAUGH

35:19.320 --> 35:21.880
There you go. Oh, yeah. I mean...

35:25.560 --> 35:27.640
- What's the horsepower?
- 260-odd?

35:27.640 --> 35:29.280
264 horses, gentlemen.

35:30.560 --> 35:33.840
Top speed of at least 115mph.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.280
That's impressive.

35:35.280 --> 35:36.640
For a garbage truck.

35:36.640 --> 35:38.880
For a sports car, maybe not so much.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.720
Where's the accelerator?
There we go.

35:42.440 --> 35:46.120
Well, it feels pretty frisky
from the driver's seat, guys.

35:46.120 --> 35:49.160
It just feels like it's ready
to drift, doesn't it?

35:49.160 --> 35:51.160
Rory, you might be persuading me

35:51.160 --> 35:53.880
about the validity
of electric cars here.

35:57.560 --> 36:00.160
TYRES SCREECH

36:00.160 --> 36:01.720
Yes!

36:01.720 --> 36:03.640
THEY LAUGH

36:03.640 --> 36:05.240
He loves it! He loves it.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.360
I think he's having a good time!

36:14.320 --> 36:16.120
TYRES SCREECH

36:16.120 --> 36:17.600
Whoa!

36:18.640 --> 36:20.760
LAUGHTER

36:20.760 --> 36:22.360
That's not bad.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.560
For me, it's a philosophical point.

36:24.560 --> 36:27.200
It's fun - I don't care about
all the cleverness.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.240
Someone's just gone,
"Let's make it fun."

36:29.240 --> 36:31.000
There you go, there you go.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.280
It is fun.

36:32.280 --> 36:33.960
All right, chuck it in here, fast.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.720
Yes! Nice one!

36:42.720 --> 36:44.080
Woohoo!

36:46.160 --> 36:49.320
What do you call
an electric doughnut?

36:49.320 --> 36:50.880
That's the name of my new band.

36:50.880 --> 36:53.760
THEY LAUGH

36:53.760 --> 36:55.320
So what do we think?

36:55.320 --> 36:56.560
A winner?

36:56.560 --> 36:58.240
Yeah, I think so. Chris?

36:58.240 --> 37:00.600
- Thumbs up from me, definitely.
- Yeah. I like it.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.440
All right -
one more lap before we go?

37:02.440 --> 37:04.360
- Definitely.
- Can I drive?

37:04.360 --> 37:07.240
- No.
- No.
- Where does it say, "Traction control off"?

37:07.240 --> 37:08.880
Good, right, let's go.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.200
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

37:13.400 --> 37:15.000
- Pretty fun.
- There you go.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.360
- I didn't think it was going to be fun.
- Oh, come on.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.240
I know I convinced you guys
in the end,

37:21.240 --> 37:23.360
but, Chris, what's your feeling
on electric cars?

37:23.360 --> 37:25.360
Well, electric cars in general,

37:25.360 --> 37:27.840
I thought the whole point
is it's about being eco-friendly,

37:27.840 --> 37:30.280
about being green and sensible.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.280
- I mean, that looked like a lot of fun.
- Yeah.

37:32.280 --> 37:35.080
- You could convert me, potentially.
- All right.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.440
I was so convinced, honestly.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.600
I don't really buy into
so much of it,

37:39.600 --> 37:42.320
but the fun message -
that thing reeked of fun.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.480
It was wonderful.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.680
- We were smiling, all three of us.
- Yeah, it was great.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.200
The looks,
I think the jury's still out

37:47.200 --> 37:48.560
on the looks of the thing, but...

37:48.560 --> 37:49.920
- And the doors.
- And the doors.

37:49.920 --> 37:51.840
- And the roof.
- Yeah.

37:51.840 --> 37:55.280
The door you can't reach to close
once you get in is difficult.

37:55.280 --> 37:59.320
All right - now, I think it's time
to see how you did

37:59.320 --> 38:01.080
in your timed lap around the track.

38:01.080 --> 38:05.480
But before we do, after you finished
your time in the car with Chris,

38:05.480 --> 38:08.320
you went out and had one more go
on your own, didn't you?

38:08.320 --> 38:09.960
- I did, yes.
- What happened?

38:11.040 --> 38:14.160
Well, I just like to think
that I was pushing,

38:14.160 --> 38:16.120
trying to find the limits
of the car,

38:16.120 --> 38:17.240
the track, the grip,

38:17.240 --> 38:19.400
finding how far I could push it

38:19.400 --> 38:23.280
and I essentially just touched the
outside kerb on the follow-through,

38:23.280 --> 38:25.840
just enough so it started
to lose it.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.760
Thought I'd caught it,
but... yeah, didn't.

38:28.760 --> 38:30.440
We have it on tape.
You want to see it?

38:30.440 --> 38:33.480
- Have you? I thought you might!
- Let's take a look at that.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.640
TYRES SCREECH

38:38.640 --> 38:40.840
Oh!

38:40.840 --> 38:43.280
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
AUDIENCE OOHS

38:45.960 --> 38:47.240
Couple of points here.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.280
LAUGHTER

38:49.280 --> 38:52.400
First of all,
well done for not dying.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.760
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.640
- Next, the way I see this...
- Yeah.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.600
..Michael Schumacher's race weekends

38:57.600 --> 38:59.960
always started off with him
pushing too far, didn't it?

38:59.960 --> 39:01.640
Always go too far, find the limits

39:01.640 --> 39:04.560
- before you actually get into the competitive aspect.
- There we go.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.200
- That's what you were doing.
- That's it.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.600
You were getting rid of
all of those negative urges,

39:08.600 --> 39:10.240
getting all the bad stuff
out the way,

39:10.240 --> 39:12.440
ready for a perfect performance.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.720
It's like auto mechanics.

39:13.720 --> 39:16.520
You tighten the bolt till it snaps,
then you back off a quarter-turn.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.800
LAUGHTER

39:18.800 --> 39:21.560
But you did manage to eventually
complete a lap, yeah?

39:21.560 --> 39:23.080
I got a lap in, but...

39:23.080 --> 39:25.360
Yeah, well, it wasn't a perfect lap.

39:25.360 --> 39:28.160
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. Let's do it.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.920
OK - who wants to see his lap?

39:29.920 --> 39:31.320
- AUDIENCE: Yeah!

39:31.320 --> 39:32.920
Here we go.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.880
OK, off the line.

39:34.880 --> 39:37.360
Bit of clutch riding,
but I think that was a good start.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.120
This is the one, this is the one.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.160
Bit of self-encouragement as well.

39:42.840 --> 39:46.440
Oh, yes - getting the car rotated
under brakes. That was fast.

39:46.440 --> 39:47.840
- Third gear through there?
- Yeah.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.840
Using all the track, and a little
bit more, too - that's good.

39:50.840 --> 39:52.440
Messy, messy.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.120
A little bit of tail-wagging,
but that's fast.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.600
Over-stopping the car.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.600
Second through Chicago.

39:59.600 --> 40:02.480
I love the way you put the wipers on
to make us think it's raining...

40:02.480 --> 40:03.920
- LAUGHTER
- ..when it wasn't raining.

40:03.920 --> 40:05.920
That was good gamesmanship,
I like that.

40:05.920 --> 40:08.280
Now, flat-out down
the back straight,

40:08.280 --> 40:11.280
braking between 150,
probably closer to the 50.

40:11.280 --> 40:13.400
Triggering those
hazard warning lights.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.240
This line looks good to me.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.360
Did you let the car roll out?

40:16.360 --> 40:18.360
You didn't open the steering
as much as I thought.

40:18.360 --> 40:19.560
Too much oversteer.

40:19.560 --> 40:21.520
- You found grip on the inside, didn't you?
- Yeah.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.560
So you'd been thinking there,
that was clever.

40:23.560 --> 40:24.800
Down the back straight.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.400
There's a cameraman,
try not to hit him.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.440
Good idea(!)

40:27.440 --> 40:29.040
So now, this turn point...

40:30.320 --> 40:31.760
- AUDIENCE OOHS
- That is rapid.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.560
Woo-hoo-hoo!

40:34.560 --> 40:36.000
Now, back through the tyre wall.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.720
You're not lacking in the,
um... trouser department there.

40:38.720 --> 40:41.040
OK, last two corners.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.360
Be brave!

40:43.640 --> 40:46.160
That's mega.
You're triggering those lights,

40:46.160 --> 40:47.880
which shows maximum braking.

40:49.720 --> 40:52.120
But now, over the line
and a bit of grass...

40:52.120 --> 40:53.200
And a yump.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.560
- Oh...!
- APPLAUSE

40:58.920 --> 41:02.440
- That... was... dead impressive.
- Thank you.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.520
Oh, thanks, mate.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.840
That looked quick.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.000
That's the most committed
I've seen around here.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.600
Absolutely, by far, yeah.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.560
And the conditions weren't perfect.

41:12.560 --> 41:17.360
- They were drier than your windscreen wiper action suggested.
- Come on!

41:17.360 --> 41:19.960
I suppose, looking at it there,
I'm wondering...

41:19.960 --> 41:21.640
Where could you have gone quicker?

41:21.640 --> 41:23.840
It looked like you were
maxed out everywhere.

41:23.840 --> 41:25.680
I was pushing it,
but I made mistakes on,

41:25.680 --> 41:27.040
I think, the first left-hander.

41:27.040 --> 41:28.920
- Could have been a bit tighter there.
- Yeah.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.680
And I could have used more width
of the track

41:30.680 --> 41:32.760
going to that right-hander,
the follow-through.

41:32.760 --> 41:34.240
- Yeah.
- Possibly. But if you go too far,

41:34.240 --> 41:36.480
you touch the painted kerb
and you see what happened.

41:36.480 --> 41:37.640
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:37.640 --> 41:40.040
I think it's a really,
really impressive effort.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.360
Hopes are high.

41:41.360 --> 41:43.480
- This is a big moment, I'm excited.
- Me too.

41:43.480 --> 41:46.120
Top of our leaderboard
is still Max Whitlock,

41:46.120 --> 41:49.400
the super gymnast, with the 1:39.5.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.920
His double lay-in,
half-in, half-out,

41:51.920 --> 41:55.400
has this almost... mournful quality
to it, it's just...

41:55.400 --> 41:57.440
LAUGHTER

41:57.440 --> 41:59.640
Anyway, that's besides the point.

41:59.640 --> 42:02.280
He has two gold medals.

42:02.280 --> 42:05.520
You have six gold medals.

42:05.520 --> 42:07.120
So, on paper,

42:07.120 --> 42:09.440
you should be three times
faster than him.

42:09.440 --> 42:11.400
LAUGHTER
Is that correct?

42:11.400 --> 42:14.120
- I'm twice his weight, though.
- That doesn't matter.

42:14.120 --> 42:17.120
- All right. Are we ready?
- Let's do it.

42:18.520 --> 42:21.720
Sir Chris Hoy, you did it...

42:26.320 --> 42:28.120
That's my favourite part.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.760
- ..in one minute...
- Yes...

42:31.760 --> 42:33.480
- 30...
- Yes...

42:33.480 --> 42:36.520
- ..5.4.
- Oh!
- No!

42:36.520 --> 42:38.920
- Really? Wow, thank you!
- CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

42:38.920 --> 42:42.560
Thank you, man.
Thank you very much, cheers.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.280
- That is mega.
- Thanks, man. Cheers.

42:45.280 --> 42:48.240
Thank you. Thank you, mate.

42:48.240 --> 42:50.640
Mate, you were amazing, really good.

42:50.640 --> 42:54.400
Right to the top, man.
That is good! Way to go.

42:54.400 --> 42:56.960
I didn't think that at all.

42:56.960 --> 42:59.400
Ladies and gentlemen, Sir Chris Hoy.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.880
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:03.880 --> 43:06.560
- That will not be beaten for some time.
- No.

43:06.560 --> 43:08.960
That will not be beaten
for some time.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.800
That was driving the wheels off it,
as they say.

43:11.800 --> 43:15.120
OK, now it's time to head back
to King of the Hammers.

43:15.120 --> 43:16.840
Earlier, we saw Sabine and Chris

43:16.840 --> 43:19.320
training for their big
off-road showdown,

43:19.320 --> 43:24.520
aided by my words of encouragement
and Eddie's deep tissue massage.

43:24.520 --> 43:27.080
But things were about
to get serious.

43:27.080 --> 43:28.280
Really serious.

43:41.200 --> 43:44.000
Race Day at King of the Hammers.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.200
Sabine and Chris would soon be
competing in an off-road race

43:47.200 --> 43:49.160
to claim the coveted title

43:49.160 --> 43:52.120
of Top Gear's Fastest Driver
Apart From The Stig.

43:53.440 --> 43:58.240
But after some overenthusiastic
practice the day before...

43:58.240 --> 43:59.880
Left, left!

43:59.880 --> 44:01.240
- Come on.
- CLANKING

44:01.240 --> 44:03.200
- I don't think it liked that.
- CLANKING

44:04.200 --> 44:05.880
..Team Jordan had issues.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.640
- What have you done here?
- What have I done?

44:09.640 --> 44:11.880
The vehicle has let itself down.

44:11.880 --> 44:13.320
Are you joking me?

44:13.320 --> 44:16.320
This was brand-new,
running perfectly.

44:16.320 --> 44:20.000
You don't turn left
when I tell you to turn left,

44:20.000 --> 44:21.960
you break the machine.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.320
You're a car wrecker.

44:23.320 --> 44:25.560
How did anyone ever drive for you?

44:25.560 --> 44:28.760
Very easy - they didn't do
silly things like this.

44:28.760 --> 44:30.960
Years ago,
I would have said to the driver,

44:30.960 --> 44:32.960
"You are a complete dick."

44:34.600 --> 44:36.960
I'm supposed to have a positive
mental vibe from you,

44:36.960 --> 44:38.000
you're beating me up.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.880
Course I'm beating you up,
because I don't want the same again.

44:40.880 --> 44:44.360
I need you to believe.
Find that commitment...

44:44.360 --> 44:47.200
I like Eddie. He's so cool.

44:47.200 --> 44:48.280
You're going to win.

44:48.280 --> 44:51.720
Just feel the vibes.
Feel the good vibes inside you.

44:53.240 --> 44:55.360
Don't talk to me. Don't talk to me.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.800
I am not talking to him.

44:58.080 --> 45:00.720
- He's not a nice man...
- You look concerned.

45:00.720 --> 45:02.000
You look a little concerned.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.280
At the moment, I don't have
a vehicle to go in the race, do I?

45:04.280 --> 45:06.360
Yes, we have this. Look. It's magic.

45:06.360 --> 45:08.840
This is the car. Look at this.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.840
Ooh, it's got a Texas flag on it.

45:12.600 --> 45:14.320
Get out of here.

45:14.320 --> 45:16.520
I love it when you act like
you don't like me, it's great.

45:16.520 --> 45:18.360
- I hate you.
- You don't hate me...

45:18.360 --> 45:22.320
- I like Sabine.
- I am not a proper lady.
- You are a scumbag.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.720
- A scumbag?
- You're trying to damage my man's head.

45:24.720 --> 45:27.040
- Scumbag! Hold on.
- It's damaged already.

45:27.040 --> 45:28.800
- You're a scumbag.
- Scumbag?

45:32.160 --> 45:34.320
'Old people are funny.

45:34.320 --> 45:37.200
'But with the atmosphere heavy
with prerace tension,

45:37.200 --> 45:40.960
'it was soon time for our drivers
to make their way to the track -

45:40.960 --> 45:42.320
'if you could call it that.'

45:43.880 --> 45:46.880
The race would start
on the choppy desert floor

45:46.880 --> 45:50.160
with Eddie and I keeping watch
from a high vantage point.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.960
Here, our drivers would
battle the dust

45:51.960 --> 45:54.440
to reach the unforgiving
rock face beyond.

45:56.040 --> 45:59.440
After a brutal uphill scramble,
a perilous ledge,

45:59.440 --> 46:01.520
ending in a do-or-die descent

46:01.520 --> 46:04.480
and a chance to get the hammer down
back on the flats.

46:06.040 --> 46:09.160
Negotiating another
short boulder pass,

46:09.160 --> 46:12.280
a fast sequence of banked turns
and flat-out jumps

46:12.280 --> 46:14.560
completes the lap.

46:14.560 --> 46:17.840
And they'll be doing all of that
eight times.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.920
So before the race
was due to begin,

46:21.920 --> 46:25.200
we headed out with our drivers
to offer some encouragement

46:25.200 --> 46:28.320
at the toughest stage of all,
the Rock Wall...

46:30.200 --> 46:32.960
..towering over 200 feet above us.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.320
Oh, my Jesus...

46:38.880 --> 46:41.080
- I mean, what the - BLEEP?
EDDIE CHUCKLES

46:43.640 --> 46:47.840
So the part that's tricky here
is if you're right behind someone,

46:47.840 --> 46:49.720
you've just got
to single-file up it.

46:49.720 --> 46:53.800
- I guess you could maybe try that side on the right...
- Oh, God.

46:53.800 --> 46:56.640
..to pass someone, but what do
you do when you get to this?

46:56.640 --> 46:59.600
You've just got to check up
and go single file, right?

46:59.600 --> 47:02.280
Yeah. So just do it.

47:02.280 --> 47:05.320
Unlike the previous day's
boulder crawl,

47:05.320 --> 47:08.160
during the race,
these loose rock scrambles

47:08.160 --> 47:10.360
would have to be attacked at speed.

47:10.360 --> 47:12.080
Whoa... whoa...

47:12.080 --> 47:13.680
And on near-vertical faces,

47:13.680 --> 47:16.520
rolling the car
was a very real danger.

47:19.840 --> 47:22.520
But at least Sabine
was in full control.

47:22.520 --> 47:24.120
SHE SCREAMS

47:24.120 --> 47:26.400
The steering wheel came off.

47:26.400 --> 47:27.840
- BLEEP - hell!

47:30.680 --> 47:32.080
- BLEEP - hell!

47:32.080 --> 47:33.280
Oh, man.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.400
- BLEEP - hell!

47:37.400 --> 47:40.840
I don't want to have
the steering wheel come off.

47:40.840 --> 47:42.800
What have we got ourselves into,
here?

47:55.480 --> 47:57.280
Top man.

47:57.280 --> 47:59.720
Nice and easy. You're OK.

47:59.720 --> 48:02.280
'Having reached the top
of the rock wall, though,

48:02.280 --> 48:05.520
'there was still the small matter
of getting back down...'

48:06.720 --> 48:08.080
This is mental.

48:09.280 --> 48:10.960
- Oh!
- CLANKING

48:10.960 --> 48:13.200
THUDDING
Oh!

48:13.200 --> 48:15.720
'..quickly learning that
this was a race about bravery

48:15.720 --> 48:16.880
'as much as speed.'

48:16.880 --> 48:18.000
Can we go back now?

48:18.000 --> 48:19.840
CHRIS LAUGHS

48:21.040 --> 48:23.880
We decided we had offered
our drivers enough encouragement

48:23.880 --> 48:26.120
and headed back to the pits.

48:26.120 --> 48:28.560
I'm glad I'm not in the car with you
for the race.

48:28.560 --> 48:31.360
Oh... this is crazy.

48:33.960 --> 48:36.200
'And after some final tweaks
to the cars,

48:36.200 --> 48:38.520
'we said our last goodbyes
to Sabine and Chris.

48:38.520 --> 48:41.360
'Well, not our last goodbyes, but...
You know what I mean.'

48:44.800 --> 48:47.360
It was time for them
to take their places

48:47.360 --> 48:49.800
out of the way
at the back of the grid.

48:49.800 --> 48:52.080
Because in this Legends Class race,

48:52.080 --> 48:56.320
they were pitted against some of
the best talent in Hammer history -

48:56.320 --> 48:59.040
all hardened veterans in an event

48:59.040 --> 49:01.560
where simply finishing
is an achievement.

49:01.560 --> 49:04.040
From the sport's fastest female,

49:04.040 --> 49:06.000
to mavericks

49:06.000 --> 49:08.120
and seasoned warriors.

49:08.120 --> 49:11.520
So really, this was a race
within a race.

49:11.520 --> 49:14.720
Schmitz versus Harris.

49:15.920 --> 49:16.960
Oof!

49:16.960 --> 49:18.120
Serious business.

49:23.080 --> 49:25.200
- It's crazy.
- You can't believe this, can you?

49:25.200 --> 49:26.840
OK, we're getting close.

49:26.840 --> 49:30.160
You stay focused
and you stay out of the roost, OK?

49:30.160 --> 49:31.680
Strategy.

49:31.680 --> 49:34.960
Usual thing,
just jump the start, if you can.

49:34.960 --> 49:38.520
Make sure you put the guy
beside you into the wall.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.480
The rest follows on from there.

49:40.480 --> 49:42.200
OK, Harris.

49:42.200 --> 49:44.760
I am on a mission
and I just want to beat you.

49:44.760 --> 49:47.800
All I can ever think
about on the grid

49:47.800 --> 49:50.480
is the fact that I wish
I'd had another wee.

49:52.520 --> 49:55.080
The desert would wait no longer.

49:55.080 --> 49:57.840
Eight laps of off-road endurance.

49:59.200 --> 50:01.480
Let the battle commence.

50:01.480 --> 50:05.480
- ANNOUNCER: Three, two, one... go!

50:08.080 --> 50:10.320
Damn it!

50:10.320 --> 50:11.880
Oh, what a start.

50:13.600 --> 50:15.320
- So much - BLEEP - in my face.

50:18.440 --> 50:21.440
Good one, my man. Go on, Chris.

50:23.840 --> 50:25.840
I don't see anything.

50:25.840 --> 50:26.920
You're OK, Sabine.

50:26.920 --> 50:28.960
Keep going, keep going.
I know the dust is bad.

50:28.960 --> 50:32.320
Just think about it as
the Nurburgring in the Stone Ages.

50:32.320 --> 50:33.840
SHE LAUGHS

50:34.920 --> 50:38.200
'Despite the dust, we were both off
to a promising start,

50:38.200 --> 50:41.200
'but that Rock Wall was looming.'

50:41.200 --> 50:42.320
Oh, God.

50:45.880 --> 50:48.800
Rocks being thrown in my face.

50:48.800 --> 50:50.800
I can't see where I'm going.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.320
This is horrendous.

50:52.320 --> 50:56.480
'But, somehow, we weren't just
in a two-car race at the back.'

50:56.480 --> 50:58.160
There's Chris in fourth place.

50:58.160 --> 51:00.360
Go on, Chris. Go on, my son!

51:00.360 --> 51:03.560
'No, we were right in the mix.'

51:03.560 --> 51:04.880
Whoo!

51:04.880 --> 51:06.880
- CRASH!
- Oh! I hit them.

51:06.880 --> 51:09.120
- Where's Sabine?
- Woo-hoo-hoo!

51:10.560 --> 51:12.000
Oh, look at that!

51:15.840 --> 51:17.040
Come on, Chris.

51:18.480 --> 51:21.480
At the top of the wall,
they were up with the pros,

51:21.480 --> 51:24.280
which should have given them
some real confidence.

51:24.280 --> 51:26.800
Oh, my God,
what am I doing this for?

51:28.400 --> 51:29.760
This is crazy.

51:31.360 --> 51:34.040
Oh, my God - just let it go,
let it go, man.

51:34.040 --> 51:35.440
Let it go!

51:37.360 --> 51:39.240
'Back down on the desert floor...

51:40.480 --> 51:42.120
'..Sabine was on my tail.

51:43.560 --> 51:46.400
'And as we tore through the rest
of the course...'

51:46.400 --> 51:48.040
Whoo...

51:48.040 --> 51:49.360
hoo!

51:49.360 --> 51:52.720
'..we saw what Hammer racing
was really all about.'

51:53.840 --> 51:55.400
Come on!

51:55.400 --> 51:58.320
'Off-road open warfare.'

51:59.720 --> 52:01.280
Let's see where my man is.

52:01.280 --> 52:02.800
- He's in third.
- Third?!

52:02.800 --> 52:03.960
Go on, Chris.

52:03.960 --> 52:06.000
'Survival of the fittest.'

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Oh, my heavens. That was close.

52:15.480 --> 52:17.480
'But as the laps piled on...'

52:17.480 --> 52:20.680
Come on, Sabine. Push, push, push!

52:20.680 --> 52:23.200
'..they weren't just battling
the other racers.'

52:23.200 --> 52:25.960
No, you're not coming past me,
you American...!

52:27.440 --> 52:29.200
These rocks are really crazy.

52:29.200 --> 52:30.760
I need to turn right.

52:30.760 --> 52:32.480
'The course was fighting back, too.'

52:32.480 --> 52:34.760
- Uh-oh.
- Hang on a second.
- She's stuck.

52:37.280 --> 52:41.000
Reverse, just a little bit.
Not much, maybe five feet.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.480
'Snared by the rocks
on the worst part of the course,

52:44.480 --> 52:47.440
'Sabine was losing precious time...'

52:47.440 --> 52:49.960
Turn the wheels all the way
to the right and go forward.

52:53.160 --> 52:55.880
'..and the rest of the pack
were getting away.'

53:04.920 --> 53:07.320
All right, try to go slow,
backwards.

53:07.320 --> 53:08.960
Straight back, slow.

53:08.960 --> 53:11.600
Back little a bit more,
a little bit more.

53:11.600 --> 53:13.840
You might have to come off
that ledge.

53:13.840 --> 53:17.600
'One wrong instruction from me
and she could roll.'

53:17.600 --> 53:19.000
All right, stop right there.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.280
Turn the wheels the other way
and go forward. To the right.

53:29.080 --> 53:30.280
There you go.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.800
Atta girl. Yeah! Good girl.

53:37.600 --> 53:39.960
You're a star, you're a star.
All right.

53:39.960 --> 53:41.200
That's OK.

53:41.200 --> 53:42.360
"That's OK"?

53:44.120 --> 53:46.120
Oh, she lost a lot of time there.

53:46.120 --> 53:48.560
'Back up and running,
to hunt down Chris,

53:48.560 --> 53:51.960
'Sabine would need wring out
all 500 horsepower

53:51.960 --> 53:54.040
'from her 6.4-litre V8.'

53:54.040 --> 53:55.520
Keep your pace, keep your pace.

53:55.520 --> 53:56.880
Holy crow...

53:58.960 --> 54:00.640
- THUDDING
- Oh, - BLEEP!

54:08.040 --> 54:10.160
As she tried to reel him back in,

54:10.160 --> 54:13.200
Chris, already on his second car
of the event,

54:13.200 --> 54:14.800
was now in trouble again.

54:16.320 --> 54:18.240
I've got a gearbox issue, I think.

54:20.440 --> 54:22.360
I can't get into second.

54:24.200 --> 54:28.280
Never mind the second gear,
you're doing brilliant, keep going.

54:29.720 --> 54:32.920
I've got a transmission issue, now.

54:32.920 --> 54:34.760
'Despite Eddie's encouragement,

54:34.760 --> 54:37.520
'losing gears at this stage
was a serious issue.'

54:37.520 --> 54:40.240
Beautiful, beautiful.
Power, power, power, power.

54:40.240 --> 54:42.960
'And, entering the final stages
of the race,

54:42.960 --> 54:46.840
'Sabine was pushing hard
to hunt down Chris.'

54:46.840 --> 54:48.920
Come on, Chris,
keep that power going.

54:48.920 --> 54:51.320
This is so strong, just make sure
you look after the car.

54:51.320 --> 54:54.720
'But with Chris's car still
just about holding together,

54:54.720 --> 54:58.240
'Hammer racing claimed
another victim.'

54:58.240 --> 55:01.480
- Oh, no.
- The car's smoking, we've got smoke coming out of the back.

55:01.480 --> 55:03.560
- The car's on fire.
- Holy - BLEEP!

55:05.920 --> 55:10.280
That looked like some bad smoke
coming out of Sabine's car.

55:10.280 --> 55:14.560
'So near the finish,
Sabine was determined to keep going.

55:14.560 --> 55:16.960
'But with the smoke
only getting worse,

55:16.960 --> 55:19.280
'as team manager, I had no choice.'

55:19.280 --> 55:21.280
All right, Sabine,
pull off, pull off.

55:21.280 --> 55:23.080
Pull off to the left.

55:23.080 --> 55:25.040
Stop, stop, stop!

55:25.040 --> 55:26.360
Way off the circuit.

55:27.840 --> 55:29.160
Get out of the car.

55:29.160 --> 55:31.840
You're in a safe spot to get out,
just get out.

55:31.840 --> 55:33.280
Just get out.

55:37.920 --> 55:39.320
Whaa!

55:40.440 --> 55:41.680
Is she all right?

55:41.680 --> 55:43.200
Yeah, she's out. She's OK.

55:45.160 --> 55:46.840
HE WHISTLES

55:53.960 --> 55:57.480
With Sabine safe,
but out of the race...

55:57.480 --> 55:59.600
The big trick is now to finish.

55:59.600 --> 56:02.120
..to claim the title
of fastest driver,

56:02.120 --> 56:04.800
I had just half a lap to go.

56:04.800 --> 56:08.360
All I could do was hold on and hope.

56:10.280 --> 56:11.680
Oh, my Lord.

56:11.680 --> 56:14.600
My legs are knackered,
my arms are knackered.

56:14.600 --> 56:18.360
I've got a mouth full of rocks
and I've got one gear.

56:18.360 --> 56:19.760
Oh! That nearly went over.

56:21.360 --> 56:23.280
Come on, more power, more power.

56:23.280 --> 56:26.440
'This had been one of
the toughest races of my life.

56:29.320 --> 56:30.800
'Bashed up.'

56:30.800 --> 56:31.880
Oh!

56:31.880 --> 56:33.120
'Bruised.'

56:33.120 --> 56:34.800
Oh, blimey.

56:34.800 --> 56:36.080
'Battered.'

56:36.080 --> 56:37.280
Oh...!

56:39.520 --> 56:40.800
Last corner.

56:40.800 --> 56:42.440
'And finally...'

56:42.440 --> 56:45.800
You beauty! You beauty!

56:46.800 --> 56:48.160
'..over.'

56:50.280 --> 56:51.640
I can safely say...

56:52.680 --> 56:54.360
..I'm not sure
if I could do that again.

57:00.480 --> 57:03.280
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

57:03.280 --> 57:07.000
- Yes.
- Congratulations to Chris.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.720
He finished fourth overall.
Amazing performance.

57:10.720 --> 57:14.800
And with that, I am delighted
to award you the prize

57:14.800 --> 57:18.320
for Top Gear's Fastest Driver
Apart From The Stig.

57:18.320 --> 57:20.680
- Congratulations.
- CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

57:24.480 --> 57:27.000
Um, I'm not sure I can...

57:27.000 --> 57:28.880
I'm not sure I can accept that,
Rory.

57:28.880 --> 57:31.000
Of course you can accept it.
You earned it, you won!

57:31.000 --> 57:32.680
- You're a winner.
- I'll take the award,

57:32.680 --> 57:35.240
but the trophy is absolutely horrid.

57:35.240 --> 57:36.720
It's of a pigeon.

57:36.720 --> 57:39.760
Eddie, how did that event compare
to what you've seen in F1?

57:39.760 --> 57:41.760
Terrifying, absolutely.

57:41.760 --> 57:44.200
I had no idea
what I was letting myself in for.

57:44.200 --> 57:46.000
It was horrific.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.640
Formula 1, poles apart,
don't even compare the two.

57:49.640 --> 57:52.080
- SABINE: - I think so.
- Quite different,

57:52.080 --> 57:54.440
but between the dust
and the boulders

57:54.440 --> 57:56.680
and the transmission problems
and, er...

57:56.680 --> 57:57.880
well, the fire,

57:57.880 --> 58:01.480
I'm not sure that's the best way
to determine who was fastest.

58:01.480 --> 58:04.720
- I'm really glad that we decided to do best two out of three.
- Right.

58:04.720 --> 58:05.880
I'm sorry?

58:05.880 --> 58:07.320
LAUGHTER

58:07.320 --> 58:09.240
We decided it was the best of three?
When?

58:09.240 --> 58:11.120
Yes, I did. Yeah.

58:11.120 --> 58:14.120
Yeah, I mean, you're up for
another challenge, right, Sabine?

58:14.120 --> 58:16.840
- Yeah.
- Different cars, different course?

58:16.840 --> 58:18.480
Yeah, bring it on.

58:18.480 --> 58:22.040
I need a car that's well prepared,
which doesn't break down

58:22.040 --> 58:23.960
and I'll take that little trophy

58:23.960 --> 58:25.920
from that little racing driver
over there.

58:25.920 --> 58:27.960
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

58:31.880 --> 58:35.040
- Chris Harris, do you accept that challenge?
- Sabine...

58:35.040 --> 58:38.440
It will be a pleasure to beat you
on another continent.

58:38.440 --> 58:41.800
Maybe this continent
is named Nurburgring?

58:41.800 --> 58:44.360
- AUDIENCE OOHS
- Let's... let's see...

58:44.360 --> 58:47.080
Oh, that's worrying.
Let's see what happens.

58:47.080 --> 58:50.280
Sounds like it's on.
OK, on next week's show,

58:50.280 --> 58:54.040
a very green, very noisy Mercedes.

58:54.040 --> 58:58.080
- And a revolutionary road trip across Cuba.
- See you then.

58:58.080 --> 58:59.840
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.

58:59.840 --> 59:02.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

59:03.305 --> 59:09.402
