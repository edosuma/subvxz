00:08.560 --> 00:12.000
[Alba] <i>From a very young age,</i>
<i>we're taught that lying is wrong...</i>

00:13.880 --> 00:16.280
<i>that it makes you a bad person.</i>

00:21.120 --> 00:23.680
<i>But that's just the first lie.</i>

00:26.680 --> 00:29.480
<i>Lies help us overcome our fears.</i>

00:31.160 --> 00:34.560
<i>They project</i>
<i>a tailored image of ourselves to others.</i>

00:36.440 --> 00:40.080
<i>In short, lies help us live.</i>

IDENTITY CARD

00:46.320 --> 00:48.320
<i>I'd lied many times in my life.</i>

00:49.320 --> 00:53.000
<i>I never felt guilt or remorse,</i>
<i>and I always got away with it.</i>

00:55.680 --> 00:57.600
<i>Until I decided to become Lidia Aguilar.</i>

00:57.680 --> 00:59.920
[Ángeles] She wasn't selected.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.360
Don Francisco, she was tricked.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.720
The girl swears up and down that...

01:05.600 --> 01:08.800
this woman stopped her
from taking the tests.

01:08.880 --> 01:12.080
-And you think I tricked her?
-You certainly fit the description.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.440
This is absurd. I am Lidia Aguilar.

01:15.520 --> 01:18.080
[Ángeles] If you are,
why don't you show us your identification?

01:18.160 --> 01:21.160
-I didn't bring it.
-Sure. What a coincidence.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.560
-Well, I'm working.
-Sure, sure.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.440
In all my time here,
I've never had a situation like this.

01:27.040 --> 01:28.920
I know every single employee.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.080
Do you know how many Antonio Garcías
or Dolores Ruizes there are here? Hmm?

01:33.640 --> 01:36.280
You did the right thing by informing me,
but...

01:37.200 --> 01:39.640
I'd like this to remain as it is,

01:39.720 --> 01:41.520
merely an unfortunate coincidence.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.520
-Yes, of course, sir.
-Thank you, Ángeles.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.760
[Ángeles] If you'll excuse me.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.760
Talk to her.
Stop her from telling anyone else.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.600
I'm sorry you had to lie again
because of me.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.520
-I don't care about that.
-Well, I do.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.480
It's obvious
that I only cause problems for you.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.040
Since I left,
everything's gone so well for you.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.320
Are you going to pretend
that nothing happened?

02:12.520 --> 02:15.400
-That kiss was a mistake.
-No, it wasn't, Alba.

02:17.240 --> 02:19.680
Since you arrived,
everything's changed for me.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.520
What do you want?

02:26.760 --> 02:27.760
You.

Father and Francisco
leave early of their own free will.

04:03.880 --> 04:07.800
We need to talk to you.
Your sister's worried about Francisco.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.080
-Mother, please!
-When isn't she?

04:10.160 --> 04:13.680

worrying him, if--

Fine.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.480
Yes, it's true.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.080
Your husband's cheating on you.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.080
He's cheating on you
with the Telephone Company.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.360
Idiot!

04:31.440 --> 04:34.520
For God's sake,
your jokes are always in such poor taste.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.680
Mother, Francisco's only problem
is that he works too hard.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.760
You see, my girl? You needn't worry.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.760
Don't obsess,
and let's get on with our lives.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.520
Have you taken your medication?

04:52.640 --> 04:54.040
-Happy?
-Yes.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.280
Switchboard?
Good morning. This is Mrs. Cifuentes.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.720
I want to speak to Carolina,
my husband's secretary.

-Good morning, Elisa.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.760
-I'll put you through to Francisco.
<i>-No, no.</i>

05:38.840 --> 05:41.480
I want to speak to you.

05:41.560 --> 05:45.000
<i>How long have you been working</i>
<i>for the company?</i>

05:45.080 --> 05:47.000
<i>Three or four years?</i>

05:47.080 --> 05:51.400
Four and a half, to be exact.
Not counting my time on the switchboard.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.840
I know.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.040
And you've always been there
when I needed you, true?

05:57.200 --> 06:00.200
<i>Of course.</i>
<i>You know how much I owe your family.</i>

06:00.280 --> 06:04.320
Look, what I'm going to propose is
to stay between us.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.840
I don't want anyone to find out.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.800
<i>-How can I help you, Elisa?</i>
-Hmm...

06:11.600 --> 06:13.680
I want to be informed
about my husband's activities.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.480
If you mean his schedule, I could--

06:21.560 --> 06:23.440
Carolina, please,

06:23.520 --> 06:26.360
we're both women who know how men work.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.640
Must I explain in detail
what I want to know?

06:30.520 --> 06:32.240
I want to know if my husband has a lover.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.880
[sighs] A lover? Francisco?

06:35.800 --> 06:38.720
Uh, I'm very sorry, but--

06:38.800 --> 06:41.040
I just want you to tell me
if you find out anything.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.040
I assure you, I can be very generous.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.480
How could you do that to me?
Do you want to get me fired?

07:00.560 --> 07:04.440
No. I don't.
I just want you to tell the truth.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.960
You're hiding something.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.680
It doesn't matter what you say,
I don't believe you.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.960
It's better to think I'm a liar
who lied to you about Mario, too.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.080
That's much better.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.760
You know what? If you're hurt,
take it out on him, not me.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.440
I've got nothing to do with this.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.040
What's going on?
We could hear you from the hallway.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.760
-Tell them. Tell them.
-[scoffs]

07:24.840 --> 07:28.160
[stammers] Her name's not Lidia Aguilar.
She's a liar.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.520
What are you saying?

07:29.600 --> 07:31.160
[Alba] Denying it
doesn't make it less true.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.440
-You're a liar.
-Ángeles...

07:33.520 --> 07:35.000
[laughing]

07:35.080 --> 07:37.920
Keep on deceiving yourself.
It's your marriage, not mine.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.240
Yes, it's my marriage. He's my husband.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.720
You didn't see anything. You made it up.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.320
She didn't make it up, Ángeles.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.640
She didn't see him with someone else.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.760
I did.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.320
At the grand opening party,
I opened the bathroom door and...

07:55.400 --> 07:58.280
I didn't know he was your husband,
so I didn't dare tell you.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.160
Lidia thought you should know.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.640
I told you I wasn't lying.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.960
[breathing heavily]

08:15.000 --> 08:16.560
Ángeles, are you all right?

08:17.480 --> 08:18.520
Ángeles!

08:21.880 --> 08:23.800
-What's wrong?
-[crying]

08:25.040 --> 08:28.120
I had an argument with Lidia.
It was just awful, Carolina.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.400
With Lidia?

08:30.360 --> 08:32.600
There's a girl
who says she's Lidia Aguilar...

08:33.280 --> 08:36.960
and that the Lidia we know
isn't really Lidia at all.

08:37.039 --> 08:39.000
She's not who she says she is.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.799
Is that why you were talking
to Francisco this morning?

08:42.880 --> 08:46.040
Yes. I told him, but he didn't believe me.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.200
He says it was a coincidence,
and he believed her.

08:48.280 --> 08:51.120
-I feel dizzy.
-Ángeles, I was looking for you.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.840
Are you all right?

08:52.920 --> 08:55.480
No, she's not.
She's a little unwell, Sara.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.360
Miss Millán, do you mind
if I take the day off?

09:00.160 --> 09:02.120
Yes, of course,
if you're not feeling well.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.920
-Thank you.
-I'll see her out.

Girls, I'd like to speak to you.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.240
This has all been a mix-up.
I can't convince Ángeles...

09:52.000 --> 09:54.240
but I wouldn't want you
to doubt me as well.

09:55.800 --> 09:59.120
Sure, it's a coincidence.
Lots of people have the same name.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.320
Don't worry about us.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.800
-Carlota, may I have a word?
-Yes, of course.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.240
Is Ángeles all right?

10:08.320 --> 10:10.600
-I just saw her in the hallway, and--
-Yes.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.960
-Well, no. It's a personal matter.
-I understand.

10:15.040 --> 10:18.120
I don't want to pry.
I was just worried it was about work.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.920
Were you aware
that tomorrow's her last day?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.160
-Yes, I heard.
-Ángeles is a model employee.

10:22.760 --> 10:26.280
I was thinking of organizing
a surprise farewell party for her.

10:26.360 --> 10:30.520
-If you could help me--
-Sure, I'd love to. Of course.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.880
It's not every day
a woman's worth is recognized.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.640
By the way, congratulations
on your part in the talk yesterday.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.960
Thanks. I just said what I think.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.080
What a lot of us think.

10:43.160 --> 10:47.080
It's nice to meet people
with whom you share ideas and beliefs.

10:48.880 --> 10:52.800
But be careful who you talk to
about the Lyceum meetings.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.720
Not everyone agrees with us.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.040
-Sure, I understand.
-Back to work.

11:10.760 --> 11:13.360
-What? Are you crazy?
-Ángeles told me everything.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.280
-Everything, or just about me?
-You don't fool me.

11:18.360 --> 11:20.240
I know your type.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.480
-Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth.
-Are you talking about yourself or me?

11:23.560 --> 11:26.240
It was tough for me
to get to where I am now,

11:26.320 --> 11:28.480
and I'm not letting anyone
jeopardize that.

11:30.240 --> 11:34.800
Mind your own business,
or you'll be the one with the problem.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.120
I hope you can prove who you are...

11:46.200 --> 11:48.440
because you'll have to prove it
to the police.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.600
What's wrong?

11:52.360 --> 11:55.080
Did you think this was
just a chat in the changing room?

11:56.920 --> 12:00.320
Ángeles may be a saint,
but I can't let this go.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.880
-[Victoria] <i>What about Francisco?</i>
-Francisco did all he could.

12:11.960 --> 12:15.200
I convinced one operator,
but, Victoria, if the cops show up...

12:15.280 --> 12:17.920
<i>Honey, if they do,</i>
<i>you'd better not be there.</i>

12:18.000 --> 12:20.400
-I can't leave now.
-Why's that?

12:20.480 --> 12:23.120
<i>If I do, they'll fire all the girls</i>
<i>who have helped me.</i>

12:23.200 --> 12:26.600
Alba sacrificing herself for her friends?

12:27.720 --> 12:31.120
I thought I taught you
not to be sentimental

12:31.200 --> 12:34.520
and that after what happened to Gimena,
you'd learned your lesson.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.960
I need fake papers
that say I'm Lidia Aguilar.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.840
-Sure. By when?
<i>-Today.</i>

12:39.920 --> 12:43.120
That's impossible.
You know I need at least two days.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.160
A birth certificate, anything.

12:45.240 --> 12:48.080
[sighs] All right.
I'll talk to my contact.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.200
Miss Aguilar?

12:49.280 --> 12:52.280
<i>Come around tonight.</i>
<i>I hope to have the papers by then--</i>

12:52.360 --> 12:55.160
What a nice coincidence.
It makes coming to work a joy.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.440
Well, coincidence or fate.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.400
It's trouble in my case,
but you can see it as you like.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.720
Why?

13:02.800 --> 13:05.800
You know, the reprimand,
the customer support department...

13:05.880 --> 13:07.520
Ah, the reprimand.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.720
-Are you always so pragmatic?
-Are you always so frivolous?

13:13.720 --> 13:17.560
You're one of the few people I know
who always says what they think.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.880
That must be a rare thing in your life.

13:19.960 --> 13:23.080
True, but I must admit
that you've disappointed me this time.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.400
Being the boss' son
with a silver spoon in my mouth

13:27.480 --> 13:29.680
doesn't mean I'm empty-headed.

13:29.760 --> 13:32.560
I've got big dreams for myself
and for the company.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.320
I'm sorry I broke your heart.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.640
Does that mean
you'll stop asking me out to dinner?

13:39.720 --> 13:40.920
-No. [tutting]
-Gee!

13:41.000 --> 13:43.120
This world is for the stubborn.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.680
And when I have a dream,
I chase it until I reach it.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.480
And what are your dreams, Miss Aguilar?

13:50.720 --> 13:53.480
Some of us don't have
the luxury of having dreams.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.000
We just try to survive.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.360
[Carlos imitating Ricardo]
What are you doing?

14:05.440 --> 14:06.480
Nothing, Don Ricardo...

14:06.560 --> 14:08.800
That's not even my best impression
of my father.

14:08.880 --> 14:12.240
-Like father, like--
-Finish that sentence, and you're fired.

14:13.040 --> 14:17.040
I sense your nervous energy is due
to more than just the line issues.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.920
Any new stroke of genius
I should know about?

14:20.520 --> 14:21.880
I'm losing sleep over the rotary.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.800
What's wrong with the little fellow?

14:24.880 --> 14:25.880
[laughs]

14:26.800 --> 14:29.240
I think I've found the key
to stop it from overheating.

14:29.320 --> 14:32.560
The exponential rise in calls
and simultaneous running is no problem

14:32.640 --> 14:34.280
if processing management is--

14:34.360 --> 14:36.240
Okay, okay!
Do you think you can solve it?

14:36.320 --> 14:40.480
I don't think so. I know so. But to check,
we need to build a prototype--

14:40.560 --> 14:43.920
Miguel, one step at a time.
First, we have to convince my father.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.720
-We'll do that tomorrow.
-You're serious?

14:46.800 --> 14:49.400
Make a list of what you need,
and I'll take care of it.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.040
It won't be cheap, Carlos.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.280
Making dreams come true never is.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.280
-[Francisco] Carolina.
-[Carolina] Good morning.

15:03.320 --> 15:06.880
-I didn't know you were here.
-There's money missing. Did you take it?

15:08.520 --> 15:09.600
It was an emergency.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.880
What kind of emergency?

15:15.480 --> 15:17.120
My sister's worried about you.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.120
She thinks you have a lover.
She asked me to find out.

15:22.600 --> 15:26.400
Remember I told you the other day
that I'd seen Alba again?

15:28.200 --> 15:29.280
It was her.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.040
She needed money, and I lent it to her.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.960
I'll pay it back, I swear.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.400
I won't say a thing. You can trust me.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.240
Thanks. It's a delicate situation.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.200
I'll have some cognac, too.
A generous amount.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.520
Why didn't you tell me before?

15:52.760 --> 15:54.920
Because Alba isn't the person she was.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.840
She's changed a lot.

16:00.880 --> 16:03.360
You're not thinking of leaving my sister,
are you?

16:05.200 --> 16:06.840
[Carlos sighs]

16:09.960 --> 16:12.440
You have to be honest with yourself,
Francisco.

16:12.520 --> 16:15.160
We're friends. That won't change,
no matter what you decide.

16:15.240 --> 16:18.160
But Elisa's my sister,
and she doesn't deserve to be hurt.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.720
Thanks, Carlos.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.840
She'd eventually get over it,

16:25.880 --> 16:28.760
but my father wouldn't rest
until he'd destroyed you.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.360
[knocking on door]

16:32.440 --> 16:33.440
Come in.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.640
Uh, Don Francisco, the police are here.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.760
-[Carlota] The best.
-[Marga] I know, right?

16:41.840 --> 16:43.720
It's amazing what you can do
with the telephone.

16:43.800 --> 16:47.400
Carlota, today's a great day,
an historic day.

16:47.480 --> 16:51.600
I hope it's not pie in the sky,
but this could be pioneering.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.840
No one understands
what you're talking about.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.240
The Rotary 7.

16:55.320 --> 16:58.440
Carlos is behind me.
We're showing it to his father.

16:58.520 --> 17:02.000
-Congratulations. What's a Rotary 7?
-What is this project?

17:02.080 --> 17:05.160
I never listen when you talk
about integral equations.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.000
I'll cut out the scientific jargon.

17:07.079 --> 17:09.640
The Rotary 7 is the future
of telecommunications.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.040
It's a long way off.

17:11.119 --> 17:14.319
I need to present the project,
build the prototype...

17:14.400 --> 17:16.240
One step at a time.

17:16.319 --> 17:17.960
[Marga] If it works, you'll be rich?

17:18.040 --> 17:19.880
My head's spinning thinking about it.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.280
[Carlota] The Cifuenteses
will make a fortune off of it.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.560
-Excuse me. Are you Miss Aguilar?
-Mm-hmm.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.640
The director wants to see you
in his office.

17:30.560 --> 17:33.840
Go right in. They're waiting for you.
[softly] Best of luck, honey.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.400
Are you Miss Aguilar?

17:42.480 --> 17:45.480
Inspector Beltrán. Take a seat, please.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.920
<i>♪ Looking in your eyes</i>
<i>Now, I can see ♪</i>

17:48.000 --> 17:51.600

17:52.960 --> 17:54.440
Relax, it's nothing.

17:55.680 --> 17:58.760
We got a report from someone...

17:59.400 --> 18:02.800
who says you took her spot
in the company's tests.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.800
I've told him things like that
don't happen in my company.

18:05.880 --> 18:09.920
-I trust my staff completely.
-It's obviously just a coincidence.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.120
Most likely.

18:11.200 --> 18:14.880
And after a simple check,
I'm sure this matter will be settled.

18:16.880 --> 18:21.800
Miss, do you have
any papers to verify your identity?

18:24.080 --> 18:26.200
-I told Don Francisco--
-Is this really necessary?

18:27.040 --> 18:28.240
I'm afraid so.

18:29.680 --> 18:32.680
Excuse me, could you leave me alone
with Miss Aguilar?

18:32.760 --> 18:33.920
It will just be a moment.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.200
Let's go.

18:37.280 --> 18:41.400
<i>♪ Love is long gone, our desire ♪</i>

18:41.480 --> 18:44.960

18:45.040 --> 18:47.360
What's all this about?

18:47.440 --> 18:49.680
You know very well
that I don't have papers.

18:49.760 --> 18:53.640
I know it, you know it, but they don't.

18:55.880 --> 19:00.280
I know all about you,
Don Francisco, your past with him...

19:00.360 --> 19:02.760
and this reunion at the station.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.160
Keep it. I have more.

19:07.400 --> 19:11.440
<i>♪ Now you'll go your own way</i>
<i>And I'll go mine ♪</i>

19:11.520 --> 19:13.640
Maybe you don't care about your life.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.560
No wonder. It's not a great life.

19:16.640 --> 19:20.800
But what if I went out there
and showed people this photo?

19:20.880 --> 19:23.560
What do you think would happen
to your dear Francisco?

19:24.760 --> 19:27.200
What do you want? Money?

19:27.280 --> 19:30.120
I'm not surprised that you got the job.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.680
You're pretty smart for a woman.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.960
-What if I say no?
-You won't.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.200
-What's taking so long?
-How should I know?

19:40.120 --> 19:41.200
Sorry.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.480
I don't like the police being here.

19:46.800 --> 19:51.080
[clears throat] Excuse me.
Shall I prepare the dismissal letter?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.280
Whose dismissal?

19:55.400 --> 19:57.800
Um, this girl's built up
several work infractions,

19:57.880 --> 20:00.480
and considering the criteria
for dismissal, I thought--

20:00.560 --> 20:02.920
Carolina, you're not paid to think.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.200
Don Ricardo may have been fond of you,

20:05.280 --> 20:09.000
but while I'm director, just do as I say
and keep your thoughts to yourself.

20:09.680 --> 20:10.920
Very well.

20:12.120 --> 20:15.200
It's all sorted out.
Miss Aguilar is who she says.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.800
It was just an unfortunate coincidence.

20:18.720 --> 20:22.080
If you don't need me,
I'd like to get back to work.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.840
Of course. Go, go.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.840
I apologize for any inconvenience
we've caused you, Mr. Gómez.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.920
-Of course.
-Mr. Cifuentes.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.400
I'm glad it's all cleared up.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.480
So am I. That girl's fantastic.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.120
By the way, I need to speak to you
and my father.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.840
I have a proposal that will change
the future of the company.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.120
What is it?

20:52.200 --> 20:53.440
It's a secret.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.040
To top it off, he chewed me out.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.720
I don't know
how she got away with it.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.560
Don't be silly. They have the same name.

21:03.640 --> 21:06.440
Still,
those Cifuenteses are a piece of work.

21:06.520 --> 21:10.000
If the police asked about any other girl,
she'd be kicked to the curb.

21:10.080 --> 21:13.640
But of course...
she's got both of them spellbound.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.200
If Cifuentes Junior
is anything like his dad,

21:17.280 --> 21:19.520
she'll handle him easily enough.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.960
-You know what I mean.
-You idiot.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.480
I don't know why I came.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.760
I am surprised at Francisco.
He's not like the Cifuenteses.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.840
Or he hides it better than they do.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.040
[Carolina] <i>It could be</i>
<i>one of the new operators,</i>

21:35.120 --> 21:37.360
<i>but far be it from me</i>
<i>to make accusations without proof.</i>

21:37.440 --> 21:39.480
And I suppose that proof comes at a price.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.520
Doña Elisa, you must understand,
I'm putting my job on the line.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.120
<i>You'll get whatever you ask for.</i>

21:46.200 --> 21:49.600
But I want proof,
and I hope you do what it takes to get it.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.720
<i>Don't you doubt it.</i>

21:53.520 --> 21:56.840
I was looking for you.
Ubalda brought the centerpieces.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.840
I need you to help me choose.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.320
Are you all right, honey?

22:01.760 --> 22:03.080
-Honey?
-Hmm?

22:04.000 --> 22:06.200
Yes, Mother, of course.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.520
-You lie as badly as your father.
-[sighs]

22:09.600 --> 22:12.640
I hope you know what you're doing
and it doesn't get out of control.

22:12.720 --> 22:15.240
Mother, please, trust me just this once.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.040
That's what your father said,
and nine months later, you were born.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.480
[chuckles]

22:24.240 --> 22:25.560
[Marga whispering] Carlota...

22:26.920 --> 22:28.440
what do you think?

22:28.520 --> 22:30.120
[sighs] I don't know.

22:30.200 --> 22:33.560
Two days ago, she told us
thugs were after her for money.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.560
Sure, maybe that's
why she changed her name.

22:37.640 --> 22:41.040
Marga, I don't know.
All I know is she's a mystery...

22:41.120 --> 22:42.840
and she never says anything
about her life.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.480
That's not true.

22:44.560 --> 22:47.120
She told us about her mother
and the thugs.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.160
She looks really upset.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.920
You don't fool around
with sickness and death.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.680
You're too trusting.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.800
-Ladies, good morning.
-[woman] Good morning, Don Ricardo.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.360
Uh, Miss Rodríguez de Senillosa?

23:03.880 --> 23:06.720
Come with me for a moment, please.

23:06.800 --> 23:07.880
Yes, of course.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.640
Operator 40... 57. 57.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.560
-Hello.
<i>-Hello, it's Pablo Santos...</i>

23:21.640 --> 23:23.440
from administration.

23:23.520 --> 23:26.480
<i>Good morning, Don Pablo.</i>
<i>How's your morning?</i>

23:27.400 --> 23:30.200
I got to work a bit late.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.440
I got lost in the subway tunnels,
and it took me 15 minutes to get out.

23:33.520 --> 23:37.000
-[Pablo chuckles]
-Madrid is a little tricky for newcomers.

23:37.080 --> 23:40.280
Well, so they tell me.
I'm from Madrid, born and raised.

23:41.200 --> 23:44.000
You'll see.
Madrid has its good things, too.

23:44.080 --> 23:47.000
I'm so hungry, the only good things
I can think of

23:47.080 --> 23:48.240
are the calamari sandwiches.

23:48.320 --> 23:49.720
[laughs]

23:49.800 --> 23:54.040
Then I won't keep you.
You need breakfast, and to make a call.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.560
<i>-What number do you want?</i>
-No number.

23:58.880 --> 24:03.360
[clears throat] In fact,
I only called to speak to you a little.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.800
[chuckles] <i>Yesterday's shift flew by...</i>

24:10.240 --> 24:12.520
[clears throat] and I wanted
to hear your voice.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.440
Don Pablo, I have to go.

24:18.080 --> 24:20.840
<i>-I've got a string of calls.</i>
-Yes, of course.

24:22.920 --> 24:26.680
Until next time, Operator 57.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.120
You know where to find me.

24:35.480 --> 24:36.680
Good morning. Operator--

24:36.760 --> 24:38.360
[woman] <i>Help!</i>
<i>There's a fire in my home.</i>

24:38.440 --> 24:39.440
A fire?

24:39.520 --> 24:41.760
<i>The fire's spreading. I can't put it out.</i>

24:41.840 --> 24:43.840
Right, relax and breathe.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.920
Um... give me your address.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.840
<i>-23 Hortaleza.</i>
-I'll take care of it.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.160
Go out at once and warn the neighbors.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.920
<i>I'll call the firemen and the authorities.</i>
<i>Relax, it'll all be fine.</i>

24:57.000 --> 24:59.720
Madrid Fire Department?
This is the Telephone Company.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.840
There's a fire at 23 Hortaleza.

25:01.920 --> 25:05.160
Send an ambulance at once.
Call the police station on Luna Street.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.440
[Carlota] Is there a problem, Don Ricardo?

25:15.520 --> 25:18.800
Actually, there is, my dear.
That's why I asked you to come.

25:18.880 --> 25:24.360
We had no idea that we had
a Rodríguez de Senillosa in our ranks.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.680
So that's it.

25:25.760 --> 25:28.960
I assume the company's interested
in my worth, not my name.

25:29.960 --> 25:33.880
I suppose you know our two families
have been friends for a long time.

25:33.960 --> 25:37.640
Yes, but I wanted to get the job
based on my own merit, not my connections.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.160
That's where you're wrong.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.400
If we'd known,
you never would have gotten the job.

25:41.480 --> 25:45.360
And I'm afraid it's reason enough
to let you go.

25:45.440 --> 25:48.680
-What?
-You'll understand that we cannot allow

25:48.760 --> 25:52.640
a woman of your station
to work as a common operator.

25:52.720 --> 25:56.560
-[scoffs] You're firing me?
-It's for your own good.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.240
Your place is down there,
among the customers,

25:59.320 --> 26:01.400
not in uniform.

26:01.480 --> 26:02.480
Right.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.880
It was my father, wasn't it?

26:05.960 --> 26:08.200
Sometimes we fathers

26:08.280 --> 26:11.520
have to make decisions
that our children don't like.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.200
But I can assure you of one thing.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.800
We're always thinking
of what's best for them.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.480
Carlota!

26:31.120 --> 26:34.120
What are you doing?
You have to go back to your post.

26:36.680 --> 26:37.760
What are you doing?

26:37.840 --> 26:41.120
You need to find someone else
to help with Ángeles' farewell.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.440
I just got fired.

26:43.840 --> 26:47.000
-No one told me about it.
-It's my father's fault.

26:47.080 --> 26:50.480
He's ashamed of me.
He won't stop until I go back home.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.920
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.240
[crying]

27:02.880 --> 27:06.480
Do you know how long
I was begging for a job like this...

27:07.360 --> 27:08.720
just to be free?

27:10.200 --> 27:12.000
I didn't care what the price was.

27:13.320 --> 27:14.760
And what was the price?

27:16.320 --> 27:20.880
Losing my home, my friends,
my family and my mother.

27:20.960 --> 27:23.720
All for this job.
And now I've even lost that.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.080
Carlota, there's still hope.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.160
I can get you rehired.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.120
What?

27:36.160 --> 27:37.840
Well, there's something...

27:37.920 --> 27:40.200
I know you won't like it,
with your principles, but...

27:40.280 --> 27:41.640
No, but...

27:42.960 --> 27:44.040
what's it all about?

27:45.200 --> 27:47.160
Spying for the Cifuentes family.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.160
[Alba] <i>Pretending is a form of lying.</i>

27:53.160 --> 27:56.040
<i>It's the same as not telling the truth</i>
<i>about how you really feel.</i>

27:56.600 --> 27:58.240
<i>It's like covering up the truth.</i>

27:59.640 --> 28:02.880
<i>Sometimes, not saying anything</i>
<i>is the best kind of lie.</i>

28:02.960 --> 28:04.360
[Francisco] Miss Aguilar.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.440
Mr. Gómez.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.920
Can we discuss what happened
in my office with that policeman?

28:11.920 --> 28:14.360
[softly] I've got nothing to say to you,
Francisco.

28:17.880 --> 28:19.400
[Victoria] <i>Problem solved.</i>

28:19.480 --> 28:22.440
Here's your identification.
You can relax now.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.840
It's not solved yet.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.280
Is there something else?

28:30.560 --> 28:31.720
Beltrán is back.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.000
Right. So?

28:39.920 --> 28:43.200
[sighs] I don't believe it.
You've fallen again?

28:43.280 --> 28:45.360
What did I tell you? What?

28:45.440 --> 28:49.400
I warned you to stay away from him,
but you let yourself be led--

28:49.480 --> 28:50.960
[shouting] What do you want--

28:51.040 --> 28:53.320
[softly] What do you want me to say?
That I'm human?

28:53.400 --> 28:55.800
That I made a mistake?
Yes, I did.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.200
I'm the one who will have to pay.

29:00.920 --> 29:02.760
That's more absolute nonsense.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.400
Francisco has plenty of money...

29:05.920 --> 29:08.560
so he can pay. It won't bother him.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.120
I suppose you told him.

29:13.240 --> 29:14.600
Beltrán threatened me.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.680
If I tell him, he'll publish the photos.

29:19.800 --> 29:23.280
[sighs] I see you're still worrying
about this man.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.080
He helped me after what I did.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.840
I'm not letting him lose
everything he's achieved.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.720
These photos aren't going to fall
into the wrong hands.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.000
Oh, really?

29:39.160 --> 29:41.200
How are you going to manage to do that?

29:43.000 --> 29:44.280
There's a prototype...

29:46.280 --> 29:47.880
that's worth a lot of money...

29:49.080 --> 29:50.440
and I'm going to steal it.

29:54.800 --> 30:00.400
Roque, I want your best champagne.
We've got something big to celebrate.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.320
Well, the second-best.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.800
Keep me under control. I haven't
achieved anything yet, and look at me.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.440
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

30:08.520 --> 30:12.080
I was thinking about
what's been happening to me lately.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.480
-So many changes...
-For the good.

30:14.560 --> 30:19.480
Now you've got a job, independence,
a boyfriend who's about to be rich.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.240
Everything you could want.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.000
I'm serious.

30:23.640 --> 30:27.960
Honestly, I didn't think
it'd be like this, you know?

30:28.040 --> 30:33.040
I don't want decisions to be made for me,
but... maybe it's simpler that way.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.520
Nobody read us the fine print
in the contract.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.680
Freedom.

30:38.600 --> 30:41.360
Look, Carlota, when you decide
to become independent...

30:42.160 --> 30:43.920
Thanks, Roque.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.640
...no one warns you being free
is a burden.

30:47.200 --> 30:50.520
The struggle to make your dreams come true
is long and brutal,

30:50.600 --> 30:52.680
but you have to make it to the end.

30:52.760 --> 30:55.080
If I'd set aside the rotary
three years ago...

30:55.800 --> 30:57.160
-we wouldn't be here.
-Sure.

30:57.240 --> 31:00.880
But if the price you pay
is your conscience or your principles,

31:00.960 --> 31:02.920
how do you know
if it's the right decision?

31:03.000 --> 31:04.520
You don't.

31:04.600 --> 31:08.040
That's part of the fun,
the unexpected things in life.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.200
Didn't you want excitement? [chuckles]

31:10.920 --> 31:15.400
If I've learned anything,
it's that before making a decision,

31:15.480 --> 31:17.240
you must answer the question...

31:18.000 --> 31:19.360
"Is it worth the sacrifice?"

31:24.320 --> 31:25.640
There's your answer.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.320
-Cheers.
-[chuckles]

31:31.960 --> 31:35.080
Miss Rodríguez de Senillosa
is your collaborator?

31:35.160 --> 31:38.000
You told me to find someone to help,
and I chose her.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.960
I gained her trust
and told her everything.

31:40.040 --> 31:42.800
She's the one helping me with the tapping
for the government delegate.

31:43.920 --> 31:47.120
If you fire her, she might talk
about the supposed coup, and then...

31:47.200 --> 31:48.360
I know what could happen.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.880
Tell her to come back.
I'll talk to Ricardo.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.480
Carlota, a little dessert wine?

31:56.560 --> 31:58.400
-No, thanks, Doña Lola.
-I'll have a little.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.960
You stick to water.
Alcohol doesn't agree with you.

32:02.040 --> 32:06.000
What's wrong with you two?
You look like you're at a wake.

32:06.840 --> 32:08.640
[door bell ringing]

32:09.400 --> 32:11.360
[Alba] Don't worry, I'll get it.

32:12.520 --> 32:15.800
[Lola] Go on,
have your purée before it gets cold.

32:20.080 --> 32:23.280
-[Carlota] It's work. It's exhausting.
-[Lola] Exhausting?

32:23.360 --> 32:24.800
What are you doing here?

32:27.280 --> 32:31.240
Hello! You're late, but here you are.

32:31.320 --> 32:34.160
-You know each other, right?
-Yes, we work together.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.440
[chuckles] Of course.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.880
-You thought that was it, right?
-[Lola] Come say hello, girls.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.760
I'll make sure Francisco himself
gets rid of you.

32:42.840 --> 32:43.920
And he will.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.160
Or does he have a reason not to?

32:51.680 --> 32:52.800
Hello, girls.

33:06.280 --> 33:07.360
Francisco?

33:07.440 --> 33:11.680
<i>♪ Sometimes demons haunt my mind ♪</i>

33:11.760 --> 33:12.840
Francisco!

33:12.920 --> 33:17.000
<i>♪ Silence is so hard to find ♪</i>

33:17.680 --> 33:20.920
<i>♪ Every memory fades ♪</i>

33:21.000 --> 33:25.560
<i>♪ While they reside ♪</i>

33:26.520 --> 33:27.800
What are you doing here?

33:28.760 --> 33:30.480
I was looking all over for you.

33:31.080 --> 33:32.200
I was...

33:33.520 --> 33:34.960
organizing some old things.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.360
But it's nothing that can't wait.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.800
-Is supper ready?
-Yes.

33:41.880 --> 33:46.640
<i>♪ Guide me through the night ♪</i>

33:46.720 --> 33:48.040
You look so pretty.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.040
-How was your day? Good?
-Yes, very good.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.480
[Francisco] Lidia.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.360
Let's go to my office. We have to talk.

34:13.280 --> 34:14.600
[Alba] You're crazy.

34:14.679 --> 34:17.840
They almost saw us, and my shift starts
in ten minutes. What's this about?

34:18.600 --> 34:20.120
Tell me what happened.

34:20.199 --> 34:23.480
What did he say? Or what did you say
to make him believe you?

34:24.520 --> 34:27.120
That doesn't matter now.
The problem's solved.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.760
Then let's see each other.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.360
We can't be seen in the company.

34:32.440 --> 34:35.000
-It's for your sake, not mine.
-Ah.

34:35.080 --> 34:37.719
You're the boss and you're married.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.400
-You're risking your future.
-I don't care about my future.

34:42.920 --> 34:45.360
Well, I do,
and you know nothing about my life.

34:47.760 --> 34:48.840
Tell me about it.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.000
Let me be a part of it again.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.800
[knocking on door]

34:55.480 --> 34:56.480
Come in.

34:58.320 --> 34:59.320
-Don Francisco.
-Yes?

34:59.400 --> 35:01.560
-Don Ricardo wants to see you.
-Tell him I'll be right there.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.800
You know he doesn't like to wait.

35:11.560 --> 35:13.080
Forgive the delay.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.480
Please, proceed.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.000
[Carlos] Francisco.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.440
[sighs]

35:21.520 --> 35:23.520
The company has come far.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.800
Days ago,
we witnessed the first transatlantic call,

35:25.880 --> 35:28.720
but now we step into the future.

35:28.800 --> 35:31.920
Gentlemen, we present automatic switching.
Miguel.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.880
All the big firms
are investing in prototypes.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.480
-Whoever builds it first--
-Will make history, sure.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.680
Yes, and make a fortune.

35:39.760 --> 35:43.640
Automatic switching gives us faster,

35:43.720 --> 35:45.680
more effective service,
with no breakdowns.

35:45.760 --> 35:46.880
And no operators.

35:46.960 --> 35:50.040
That's right. Interline connection
would be done directly.

35:57.360 --> 36:02.800
Perhaps it's a good idea,
but we need subscribers, more lines.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.040
That's our only objective...

36:06.360 --> 36:09.400
and what I want the company
to put all its energy into.

36:09.960 --> 36:13.880
150,000 subscribers... not one less.

36:15.800 --> 36:19.760
-[whispering] We'll more forward with...
-[Francisco] Carlos! Carlos, wait.

36:20.400 --> 36:23.200
We've just made a huge investment
and hired a lot of staff.

36:23.280 --> 36:26.120
Naturally, your father's priority
is to get new subscribers.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.960
I'm not angry about the project!

36:28.040 --> 36:29.960
If it's not the Rotary 7,
it'll be the 8 or 9.

36:30.040 --> 36:31.840
What hurts
is that I've always supported you.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.560
I'm sorry.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.840
-I've always supported you, too.
-[scoffs]

36:35.920 --> 36:38.400
Except when my father
has another opinion, right?

36:38.480 --> 36:40.920
In there,
it was just his opinion and your silence.

36:41.920 --> 36:44.840
My father should be proud
to have the perfect guard dog at his side.

36:45.920 --> 36:48.000
I thought we were brothers...

36:48.080 --> 36:50.960
but now I see that you'd rather
play the part of his son. Thanks.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.640
Don't worry.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.520
-He'll get over it.
-Do you really think so?

36:59.600 --> 37:01.040
I'm starting to doubt it.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.080
It was a great idea.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.240
If we got rid of the operators,
we wouldn't be able to listen in...

37:08.320 --> 37:11.120
and we wouldn't be here.

37:13.240 --> 37:16.440
If that's so important to you,
you'll understand my latest decision.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.720
I'm rehiring the colonel's daughter.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.880
She's one of our collaborators.

37:22.960 --> 37:25.440
So unless you want the whole city
to know what we're doing,

37:25.520 --> 37:27.200
you'll have to convince the colonel.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.400
Carolina?

37:31.480 --> 37:34.400
Like I said,
she's come to stay at our boardinghouse.

37:34.480 --> 37:35.680
Lidia was stunned.

37:35.760 --> 37:38.080
Imagine, after what happened
yesterday with the police.

37:40.120 --> 37:43.520
It was all my fault.
I shouldn't have told her about Lidia.

37:44.120 --> 37:46.520
It's in her interest
to make Lidia look like a liar.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.680
Why?

37:50.760 --> 37:51.960
No... no reason.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.400
No, no. What do you mean, "no reason"?

37:56.080 --> 37:57.360
What's going on?

37:59.240 --> 38:02.160
I tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't let me.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.400
Carolina's the woman Marga saw
with your husband.

38:08.760 --> 38:09.600
Really?

38:11.840 --> 38:12.880
Yes.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.240
[gasping]

38:19.920 --> 38:22.200
-[crying]
-[Marga] Ángeles, wait!

38:22.280 --> 38:24.920
I hope she puts Mario
and that woman in their place.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.240
It's all their fault.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.880
Did you hear about Lidia? [sniffles]

38:41.640 --> 38:43.160
It was all a mistake.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.800
Don't kid yourself, Ángeles.
She's got a lot to hide.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.280
Sure. I suppose so.

38:51.080 --> 38:54.440
I can't trust anyone lately.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.920
I don't feel very well.

39:01.760 --> 39:03.480
What's wrong, Ángeles?

39:06.560 --> 39:08.360
I've found out that...

39:10.120 --> 39:11.760
Mario has a lover.

39:13.160 --> 39:16.200
But... a lover? Are you sure?

39:17.760 --> 39:18.760
Yes.

39:19.800 --> 39:25.200
And, so... have you spoken to him,
or just...

39:25.280 --> 39:26.480
No.

39:27.440 --> 39:30.240
I haven't said anything to him, because...

39:30.320 --> 39:31.320
I'm pregnant...

39:32.800 --> 39:37.440
and I don't want him to know
about a child he doesn't want.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.280
Pregnant?

39:41.000 --> 39:42.400
[sighs]

39:50.400 --> 39:51.400
[man] Excuse me.

39:52.320 --> 39:55.120
Críspulo Miranda, reporter at <i>El Sol.</i>

39:55.960 --> 39:58.280
I'd like to speak
to the head of the operators.

39:58.360 --> 40:02.880
The residents of 23 Hortaleza,
whose building caught fire yesterday,

40:02.960 --> 40:04.920
keep talking about an operator

40:05.000 --> 40:08.280
whose assistance was key
in bringing a happy ending to the story.

40:08.360 --> 40:10.400
Ladies, you heard Mr. Miranda.

40:10.480 --> 40:13.440
The operator who helped with the fire,
please identify yourself.

40:13.520 --> 40:16.640
Really, Carlota, I can't. I really can't.

40:16.720 --> 40:18.520
-We're waiting.
-[muttering inaudibly]

40:18.600 --> 40:20.360
[sighs heavily]

40:20.440 --> 40:21.440
It was me.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.320
Yes.

40:24.400 --> 40:27.680
Yes, I saved them all. [clears throat]

40:29.080 --> 40:32.760
Carlota Rodríguez de Senillosa.
At your service, Don Críspulo.

40:35.080 --> 40:37.080
[Carlota] When I got the distress call,

40:37.160 --> 40:39.760
I called the fire department,
then the hospital,

40:39.840 --> 40:41.760
and the rest is history.

40:42.400 --> 40:46.880
Believe it or not,
we women are ready to face any situation.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.880
Though some men might not agree...

40:49.800 --> 40:53.000
[Mario] Who knew that the telephone
was going to save lives?

40:53.080 --> 40:54.400
What a story!

40:56.760 --> 40:57.760

40:57.840 --> 41:01.840

41:01.920 --> 41:03.920

41:07.680 --> 41:10.800
Good afternoon, Don Pablo.
Do you want to talk?

41:10.880 --> 41:13.400
[stuttering] No, actually...

41:13.480 --> 41:17.680
[clears throat]
I was calling to clear up a doubt.

41:20.600 --> 41:21.840
A doubt?

41:21.920 --> 41:24.720
<i>This morning in the lobby,</i>

41:24.800 --> 41:30.200
I saw an operator being interviewed
about the fire...

41:33.040 --> 41:35.440
but she wasn't the one
who handled the incident.

41:36.560 --> 41:37.680
It was you.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.040
How can you be so sure
I wasn't the one being interviewed?

41:43.800 --> 41:44.800
Well...

41:46.040 --> 41:49.480
Because I'd recognize your voice anywhere,
Miss 57.

41:51.280 --> 41:53.200
<i>That operator didn't have your voice.</i>

41:55.520 --> 41:59.000
<i>-Why didn't you want to say it was you?</i>
-I'll be honest.

41:59.080 --> 42:03.000
It's true, I called the fire department,
but I can't be in the news.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.440
My family disapproves of my work,

42:04.520 --> 42:08.240
<i>and I didn't want to upset them</i>
<i>by appearing in the papers.</i>

42:08.320 --> 42:10.440
<i>My parents want me to get married,</i>

42:10.520 --> 42:12.520
<i>but I'd rather work and be independent.</i>

42:12.600 --> 42:14.880
[chuckles] A progressive woman.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.080
-Do you mind?
-No.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.840
[chuckles] <i>That's great.</i>

42:20.440 --> 42:24.040
Do you have anyone you have to answer to?

42:24.120 --> 42:25.240
Me?

42:29.960 --> 42:33.640
No, I only answer to myself. [chuckles]

42:34.960 --> 42:36.360
[stammering] Listen, miss,

42:36.440 --> 42:40.000
<i>I can't talk now. I've got a lot of work.</i>
<i>Sorry. Bye.</i>

42:41.880 --> 42:43.120
Thanks a lot, Don Pablo.

42:48.920 --> 42:51.280
What a day!
Let's get dolled up for Ángeles' party.

42:51.360 --> 42:54.240
I really don't know
why she's leaving voluntarily.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.840
She wants to look after her family,
doesn't she?

42:56.920 --> 42:58.240
-By the way, I can't go.
-What?

42:58.320 --> 43:01.880
-I have to do overtime.
-Sure, you really need to!

43:01.960 --> 43:04.360
-You're avoiding Pablo.
-I can't! Don't go on about it!

43:04.440 --> 43:09.560
-How can you be so dull?
-I lied to him. I told him that I...

43:09.640 --> 43:12.160
Look, this is the report
from customer support...

43:13.400 --> 43:14.960
[Ángeles] Lidia. Lidia.

43:16.720 --> 43:17.840
[stammers]

43:19.240 --> 43:23.320
Um... it isn't easy for me
to say this to you...

43:24.280 --> 43:25.360
You don't have to.

43:25.440 --> 43:28.240
No, I do. I do. Please.

43:29.680 --> 43:31.040
You were right.

43:32.880 --> 43:36.400
[sighs] I was furious about Mario, and...

43:36.480 --> 43:39.120
I didn't even give you
the benefit of the doubt.

43:40.360 --> 43:41.840
I was wrong.

43:41.920 --> 43:46.280
Wrong about you and wrong about Carolina.

43:48.200 --> 43:49.720
I'm sorry, Lidia.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.920
It's all right. It's fine.

43:56.720 --> 43:59.600
[Alba] <i>When someone lies,</i>
<i>they should not try their luck.</i>

44:05.920 --> 44:09.720
<i>Especially not if they were almost caught</i>
<i>and barely managed to get away with it.</i>

44:14.080 --> 44:16.080
<i>Perhaps I wouldn't get the money,</i>

44:16.160 --> 44:20.560
<i>but I could get something</i>
<i>even more valuable.</i>

44:24.920 --> 44:29.280
-It looks like this is the end.
-Don't let my father get you down.

44:29.360 --> 44:33.080
He's an expert at killing dreams.
We'll carry on until the end.

44:33.880 --> 44:36.080
-What's wrong, huh?
-[Miguel sighs]

44:36.160 --> 44:38.800
-Afraid of my father?
-[Miguel] It's not that.

44:40.160 --> 44:45.040
When Francisco said that the rotary
would mean the end of operators,

44:45.120 --> 44:48.680
I thought about how hard it was
for Carlota to become independent.

44:49.400 --> 44:52.280
If the rotary becomes a reality,
it's the end of operators.

44:52.360 --> 44:55.720
[Carlos] Dreams aren't free. You knew that
when you started on the rotary.

44:55.800 --> 44:58.680
[Miguel] Yes, but it was the dream
of a science nut, not a reality.

44:58.760 --> 45:00.040
I didn't think of the consequences.

45:00.120 --> 45:03.440
Sometimes you have to choose...
your conscience or your dreams.

45:03.880 --> 45:06.720
Geniuses make history, not cowards.

45:07.440 --> 45:09.560
Well, geniuses and their patrons.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.640
[chuckles] Yes.

45:12.360 --> 45:13.760
-What about your father?
-My father!

45:13.840 --> 45:17.160
When the rotary's up and running,
he'll have to say we were right.

45:17.240 --> 45:18.360
I'll take the blueprints.

45:18.440 --> 45:21.720
I'll get the money to do it,
but this needs to stay between us.

45:21.800 --> 45:24.560
Got it? No one's to know.

45:31.800 --> 45:34.080
I don't know how
I can look you in the eye.

45:34.160 --> 45:36.640
-This is a nice surprise.
-Don't touch me.

45:36.720 --> 45:37.720
Wait.

45:43.360 --> 45:46.320
-What's eating you?
-Your wife knows you're cheating.

45:46.400 --> 45:48.160
-What?
-She told me herself.

45:48.240 --> 45:50.800
I'm a fool
to believe your two-bit promises.

45:51.800 --> 45:52.800
Wait.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.520
This doesn't change anything.

46:01.400 --> 46:02.400
Oh, no?

46:03.480 --> 46:04.760
Then you're leaving her?

46:07.680 --> 46:09.000
I told I would.

46:10.280 --> 46:11.280
Good.

46:12.120 --> 46:15.320
Then can you explain
why she's pregnant again?

46:17.800 --> 46:19.520
[scoffs] Sure.

46:20.480 --> 46:22.280
Pretend you didn't know.

46:30.640 --> 46:34.400
Miss Millán,
can I talk to you for a moment?

46:34.480 --> 46:40.080
Yes. Yes, Ángeles, but outside.
I need a pick-me-up. It's been a long day.

46:40.160 --> 46:42.680
-Will you come with me?
-Yes, of course.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.560
-What I wanted to say--
-We can talk it over inside.

46:55.400 --> 46:57.680
-[indistinct chatter]
-[woman whispering] It's Ángeles.

46:57.760 --> 47:02.160
I can't stay long.
Sofía's with Doña Paca, and--

47:02.240 --> 47:04.000
[all] Surprise!

47:04.080 --> 47:06.120
-[all applaud]
-[gasps]

47:07.320 --> 47:09.120
If I hadn't tricked you,
you would've gone home.

47:09.200 --> 47:10.320
[Ángeles chuckles]

47:10.400 --> 47:12.000
I didn't expect this.

47:14.320 --> 47:16.520
-Thank you. They're beautiful.
-Honey!

47:16.600 --> 47:17.840
[woman] Congratulations!

47:20.680 --> 47:23.960
-Are you happy?
-[chuckling] Yes. Yes, very.

47:24.040 --> 47:26.160
I really didn't expect this.

47:30.880 --> 47:33.800
I couldn't say it before,
but thanks to what you did,

47:33.880 --> 47:36.400
I haven't lost my job
and I didn't have to go back home.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.200
The question...

47:39.560 --> 47:41.840
The question is... why?

47:44.600 --> 47:46.040
Am I missing anything interesting?

47:46.120 --> 47:48.920
No. No, we were just talking
about the interview I gave today.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.600
Now that you are a celebrity,
I'll have to share you.

47:51.680 --> 47:53.360
-Get used to it.
-[chuckles]

47:53.440 --> 47:56.680
This is Sara Millán, my supervisor.
Maybe you know her.

47:56.760 --> 47:59.560
Only by sight.
We have never been properly introduced.

47:59.640 --> 48:01.960
-Miss Millán.
-Just Sara in here.

48:02.040 --> 48:04.600
That's fine, Sara. I am Miguel Pascual,

48:05.280 --> 48:06.920
The one who suffers
because of the misfortunes

48:07.000 --> 48:09.040
of the new heroine
of Madrid's working class.

48:09.120 --> 48:11.200
-Sufferer is my middle name.
-[both chuckle]

48:14.800 --> 48:15.840

48:17.560 --> 48:18.680
Sure.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.240

48:29.240 --> 48:30.880

49:09.880 --> 49:10.960
I'd like to see you.

49:11.640 --> 49:14.320
<i>Well, to talk for a while.</i>

49:15.120 --> 49:18.080
It's time we put our cards on the table,
don't you think?

49:21.640 --> 49:24.920
Your attention.
Attention, please, one second.

49:25.840 --> 49:29.240
I want to say a few words
to honor Ángeles.

49:32.840 --> 49:35.400
This is a celebration

49:35.480 --> 49:39.640
to pay tribute to the woman
I've been lucky enough to work with.

49:41.920 --> 49:46.360
Ángeles' conduct is impeccable,
inside and outside of work.

49:47.640 --> 49:51.520
And it pains me that she's leaving
to devote herself to her family.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.280
Those are her wishes.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.960
So, a big hand for her,

Didn't we agree
that you'd look after Sofía and the home?

51:19.280 --> 51:22.120
Yes. And you promised
to be faithful to me...

51:23.040 --> 51:26.000
and you had no qualms
about cheating on me with Carolina.

-No.

51:29.800 --> 51:33.600

It's not like that. Ángeles! Ángeles!

51:35.400 --> 51:38.280
You could do as you please
and cheat on me!

51:38.360 --> 51:41.680
-Leave me alone.
-Ángeles, stop. Stop.

51:45.560 --> 51:46.760
I made a mistake.

51:48.840 --> 51:50.440
We were mad at each other.

51:51.520 --> 51:52.920
She threw herself at me.

51:55.320 --> 51:56.840
It won't happen again.

I made it up to find out
if you and Carolina were still together,

52:24.560 --> 52:29.160
and now I see...
she went to you with the story.

52:57.320 --> 52:58.960

53:03.560 --> 53:05.160

54:16.040 --> 54:18.760
I don't want you throwing your life away,

54:19.360 --> 54:20.560

54:21.520 --> 54:22.520

I'm grateful for what you did,
but when I pay my debt--

54:26.280 --> 54:27.840
I don't care about the money.

54:29.040 --> 54:31.480
Ten years apart,
and finally we're together.

54:32.440 --> 54:33.720
It's a sign, Alba.

54:33.800 --> 54:36.520
If I'd known you worked here,
I never would've come.

54:37.440 --> 54:39.640
You can't be in love with me.
You don't know me.

54:39.720 --> 54:42.840
-I'm in love with you.
-You're in love with my memory.

54:43.400 --> 54:45.160
Tell me you feel nothing for me.

54:45.840 --> 54:47.960
That the kiss meant nothing.

54:48.040 --> 54:50.600
Look into my eyes and tell me,
and I'll leave you alone.

54:52.480 --> 54:57.400
The kiss at the station was between
two kids who'd just arrived in Madrid.
