WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:05.396
Mmm! Mmm! Baby, your pot roast
is my favorite dish.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.398
So, why didn't you
eat more of it, then?

00:07.442 --> 00:10.662
Oh, no. No, I'm not going
into another food coma

00:10.706 --> 00:12.099
on family game night.

00:13.752 --> 00:16.755
Your casserole last week
gave me the itis.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.149
Yeah, you are
the only person

00:19.193 --> 00:22.805
I've ever known to fall asleep
playing Twister.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.763
It was like, left hand on blue,

00:24.807 --> 00:27.853
right hand on green,
drool on yellow. [laughs]

00:27.897 --> 00:29.899
Well, y'all are in trouble
tonight,

00:29.942 --> 00:31.683
because I took a nap at work.

00:32.945 --> 00:37.820
And I'm about to destroy
y'all butts in some Uno.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.648
What is it with you
and that game?

00:39.691 --> 00:41.998
Yeah, man, that box says
it's for seven-year-olds.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.871
And up! Don't forget
about the "and up"!

00:45.915 --> 00:47.917
[doorbell rings]

00:47.960 --> 00:49.701
Oh, who's that?

00:49.745 --> 00:52.269
It better not be
Crackhead Victor.

00:52.313 --> 00:56.186
I told him I don't want
to buy no life jacket.

00:56.230 --> 00:58.754
Oh, damn.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.016
Is it Victor?

01:00.060 --> 01:03.541
No, worse.
The Johnsons.

01:03.585 --> 01:06.501
Did somebody say
"game night"?

01:06.544 --> 01:07.893
What are you
guys doing here?

01:07.937 --> 01:09.982
I invited them.
Come on in, guys.

01:10.026 --> 01:12.463
When we heard you guys
had a weekly game night,

01:12.507 --> 01:14.074
I got so excited.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.468
Dave loves games.

01:17.512 --> 01:18.904
Yeah, the whole
family does.

01:18.948 --> 01:20.558
Dave loves games.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.126
Okay, maybe I love them

01:23.170 --> 01:24.736
a little bit more
than everybody else,

01:24.780 --> 01:26.173
but what's not to love?

01:26.216 --> 01:27.652
People coming together
in the spirit

01:27.696 --> 01:29.828
of competition,
cooperation, camaraderie.

01:29.872 --> 01:32.570
I usually fall asleep.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.181
Okay, Calvin,
what do you say?

01:34.224 --> 01:37.706
You ready to square off
against another OG?

01:37.749 --> 01:40.404
Original gamesta.

01:42.928 --> 01:45.235
Your turn.

01:45.279 --> 01:48.499
Oh. Oh. Okay.

01:48.543 --> 01:50.849
Uh...

01:50.893 --> 01:52.242
Hmm.

01:56.942 --> 02:00.381
Jenga. I win!

02:00.424 --> 02:02.209
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:02.252 --> 02:03.688
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:09.651 --> 02:14.177
Which brings us to our fourth
option-- Potato Famine Farmers.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.874
You did this.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.659
Okay,

02:17.702 --> 02:19.661
now, the rules
are really quite simple.

02:19.704 --> 02:22.881
Everyone will play as farmers
during the Irish Potato Famine,

02:22.925 --> 02:24.796
who are trying to get
their families back to Dublin

02:24.840 --> 02:27.190
so they can avoid starvation.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.671
Now, to get there, you'll
utilize a combination

02:29.714 --> 02:33.196
of victory points, agricultural
bonuses, and trail attacks.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.590
Now I don't want
to get ahead of myself--

02:35.633 --> 02:37.635
and this is not a requirement--

02:37.679 --> 02:40.464
but what's everybody's basic
understanding of Gaelic?

02:40.508 --> 02:43.554
You're right.
I did this.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.643
No. Come on.
This game is a blast.

02:45.687 --> 02:49.212
Look, around here,
we don't play games in Gaelic.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.171
We play in English.

02:51.214 --> 02:53.912
[laughs]
Yeah, that's why we play Uno.

02:56.437 --> 02:58.265
Well, I vote
for the potato game.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.963
You know, I love Riverdance,
so maybe I'll like this.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.358
Hey, Malcolm,
can I go play video games

03:04.401 --> 03:05.794
in your room instead?

03:05.837 --> 03:06.882
Yeah. Sure, little man.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.275
Whoa.
Uh, seriously, buddy?

03:08.318 --> 03:10.233
You... you want
to go play video games

03:10.277 --> 03:12.453
instead of having fun
with your family and friends?

03:12.496 --> 03:13.323
See ya.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.415
[laughs]
Yeah. I'm going with Grover.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.112
Whoa, hold on. I...

03:20.156 --> 03:21.897
Calvin, Calvin, this...

03:21.940 --> 03:23.290
Look, this'll give us a chance

03:23.333 --> 03:25.161
to all hang out
and have fun together.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.554
Come on, baby.
He's our guest.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.599
Let's play a new game
for a change.

03:28.643 --> 03:32.037
Okay, but I don't want to
be a shamrock sharecropper.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.476
What other games
you got in there?

03:35.519 --> 03:38.000
Uh, okay. You know what?

03:38.043 --> 03:40.089
Here's a good one.
It's called Naming Names.

03:40.132 --> 03:41.482
Naming Names?

03:41.525 --> 03:43.788
Around here, that game is called
"snitching."

03:43.832 --> 03:45.181
Mm-hmm.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.617
I actually
like this one.

03:46.661 --> 03:48.097
Actually?

03:48.140 --> 03:49.925
Take the win,
sweetheart.

03:49.968 --> 03:52.623
Come on, Milton Bradley.
How do you play?

03:52.667 --> 03:54.973
Joke's on you.
Personal hero of mine.

03:55.017 --> 03:57.846
Okay.

03:57.889 --> 04:00.196
Here's how this works. I'll read
a question from the deck like,

04:00.240 --> 04:01.676
"What's your favorite hobby?"

04:01.719 --> 04:03.330
And then everyone will
write down their answers.

04:03.373 --> 04:04.722
And then I'll read the answers,

04:04.766 --> 04:06.071
and we'll all guess
who wrote what.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.248
Okay. Cool. I'll keep score.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.945
Well, it's not really
about keeping score.

04:09.988 --> 04:12.730
It's-it's more of a game of
just getting to know each other.

04:12.774 --> 04:15.516
Well, get to know me.

04:15.559 --> 04:18.432
I'm Calvin Butler
and I keep score.

04:20.390 --> 04:23.263
All right, after eight rounds,

04:23.306 --> 04:25.613
guess who has a ten-point lead.

04:25.656 --> 04:28.224
Me. [laughs]

04:28.268 --> 04:30.879
How do you say "I'm kicking
your ass" in Gaelic?

04:30.922 --> 04:32.533
[laughs]
Come on, Dave.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.274
Hit me with
another question.

04:34.317 --> 04:35.753
Here's a good one.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.886
"What's something bad
you've done,

04:37.929 --> 04:39.931
but never told anyone about?"

04:39.975 --> 04:42.412
Damn, this is a nosy-ass game.

04:44.588 --> 04:47.243
Okay, while you're all writing,
I'll tell you mine.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.246
Uh, I once asked
for a water cup

04:50.290 --> 04:54.337
at a fast food restaurant
and filled it with lemonade.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.907
Wow, Dave. Thank God
you turned your life around.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.735
Okay. All right, all right.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.171
[clears
throat]

05:02.214 --> 05:03.912
Here we go. Here we go.
All right.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.523
The first answer is...

05:06.567 --> 05:09.396
Oh, it looks like I'm not
the only bad boy in the room.

05:09.439 --> 05:12.094
Someone wrote,

05:12.137 --> 05:13.400
"I shoplifted."

05:13.443 --> 05:15.445
Malcolm.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.447
He doesn't have a job.
It's got to be him.

05:18.535 --> 05:21.190
Boom! Another point
for your boy!

05:21.233 --> 05:22.931
Whoa. So, just because
I don't have a job,

05:22.974 --> 05:24.672
that makes me a thief?

05:24.715 --> 05:28.240
I'm just saying, if the shoe
fits, you probably stole it.

05:28.284 --> 05:31.113
Well, you can take your point
off, 'cause it wasn't me.

05:32.288 --> 05:34.464
It was me.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.640
I'm the shoplifter.

05:36.684 --> 05:39.077
Oh, damn.
I should've knew it.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.775
Malcolm was too
obvious, man.

05:40.818 --> 05:43.604
Damn, Gemma,
you're a thief?

05:43.647 --> 05:46.389
I can see that.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.130
You never told me
you shoplifted.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.958
It was a long time ago.

05:50.001 --> 05:52.613
Is it weird
that I'm turned on by that?

05:52.656 --> 05:54.092
I was in junior high.

05:54.136 --> 05:57.095
Then the answer is yes.

05:57.139 --> 05:58.401
Wait. So, what'd you steal?

05:58.445 --> 06:00.229
A Star Trekbackpack.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.623
Oh, damn it.
It's sexy again.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.365
[laughs]

06:05.408 --> 06:08.629
Wait. You stole
a Star Trekbackpack? Gemma,

06:08.672 --> 06:11.632
live long and plunder.

06:11.675 --> 06:15.200
Actually, I was aiming for the
Spice Girls, but I panicked.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.812
I wanted Sporty, but
instead I grabbed Spock.

06:17.855 --> 06:20.162
Hmm.
And then what?

06:20.205 --> 06:21.424
I ran out.

06:21.468 --> 06:22.947
Damn!

06:22.991 --> 06:27.299
My girl Gemma
outrunning the po po.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.997
No, no, no.
No one chased me.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.042
What?
What?
What?

06:33.871 --> 06:37.484
Yeah, I was so on edge, I
binged, like, four Cinnabons

06:37.527 --> 06:39.181
just to calm down.
Ooh.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.444
Girl, if you was black,
you'd still be sitting in jail

06:41.488 --> 06:45.361
with type 2 diabetes.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.711
Wait. You think I got away
with it because I'm white?

06:47.755 --> 06:49.887
Yes, definitely.
Yeah.
Of course.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.456
Shoot, I was in the store
the other day.

06:53.500 --> 06:57.242
Security followed me so long,
I thought I didsteal something.

06:58.766 --> 07:01.159
That still happens?Are you kidding?

07:01.203 --> 07:02.509
I have more followers
in a department store

07:02.552 --> 07:04.336
than I do on Twitter.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.514
Yeah, it's profiling, man.

07:07.557 --> 07:09.472
It's still an everyday thing
for us.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.040
Yeah, tell me about it.
You just did it to me.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.476
What are you talking about?

07:13.520 --> 07:14.782
You just accused me
of shoplifting

07:14.825 --> 07:16.044
and called me a thief.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.437
I was playing a game.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.655
Stop being so sensitive.

07:19.656 --> 07:20.962
Oh, so now
you're calling me soft?

07:21.005 --> 07:22.180
All right, you two.

07:23.530 --> 07:24.966
Yeah, um, you know what?
Let's do another question.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.402
[laughs]
Here's a good one.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.186
"Who's your favorite Smurf?"

07:29.231 --> 07:31.146
No, you know what, Dave?
I don't want

07:31.189 --> 07:33.148
to play with somebody
who keeps disrespecting me.

07:33.191 --> 07:35.890
Boy, sit down.
Ain't nobody disrespecting you.

07:35.933 --> 07:38.240
Yes, you are, Pop.
You do it all the time.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.894
Well, maybe I wouldn't have to

07:39.937 --> 07:42.113
if you did something worthy
of my respect.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.942
Forget this, man.
I'm out of here.

07:44.986 --> 07:46.814
Malcolm?

07:46.857 --> 07:49.338
[door slams shut]Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.035
I didn't mean
to start a fight

07:51.079 --> 07:52.863
just because I stole
a stupid backpack.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.822
You stole a backpack?

08:02.569 --> 08:06.268
The point is, I felt so bad
for stealing that backpack,

08:06.311 --> 08:11.229
I realized the right thing to do
was to return it and apologize.

08:11.273 --> 08:13.580
Good job, Mom.
I'm proud of you.

08:13.623 --> 08:15.538
Aw, thanks, baby.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.931
All right, buddy. Now
go put on your pajamas

08:16.974 --> 08:18.367
and brush your teeth.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.761
I'll be up to tuck you in
in a minute.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.458
Wow. You handled
that really well,

08:22.502 --> 08:23.851
but why didn't you tell
everybody else

08:23.894 --> 08:25.287
you returned the backpack?

08:25.330 --> 08:26.854
Because I didn't.
I'm a thief and a liar

08:26.897 --> 08:28.464
and a terrible mother.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.901
That-That's not true.

08:30.945 --> 08:33.295
You're not a terrible mother.

08:33.338 --> 08:36.559
Yes, I am. I just lied
to my son's face.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.300
Yes, I know,
but that's only because

08:38.343 --> 08:41.129
you don't want him
to grow up to be like you.

08:41.172 --> 08:43.958
I'm serious. What do
you think I should do?

08:44.001 --> 08:45.873
Return the backpack?

08:45.916 --> 08:47.396
Wait. You still have it?

08:47.439 --> 08:49.485
Gemma, that's sick.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.748
And, again, sexy.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.925
Ugh! I feel terrible.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.884
Well, how do you think
I feel?

08:56.927 --> 09:00.278
I just drove a wedge
between Calvin and Malcolm.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.150
I tore their entire
relationship apart.

09:02.193 --> 09:04.326
I think you're being a
little dramatic, Dave.

09:04.369 --> 09:07.634
Dramatic? I'm a home-wrecker.

09:07.677 --> 09:11.507
Whatever. I never want to
play this stupid game again.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.814
Well, it's not
the game's fault.

09:13.857 --> 09:16.381
Hate the players, not the game.

09:20.603 --> 09:23.998
What are you
still doing here?

09:24.041 --> 09:26.522
Have you been
up all night?

09:26.566 --> 09:29.003
Oh. [laughs] Well, Dave left
behind Potato Famine Farmers.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.005
At first
I started playing it ironically,

09:31.048 --> 09:32.528
and then I got hooked.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.878
[laughs]

09:34.922 --> 09:36.750
Daddy, my family is starving!

09:36.793 --> 09:39.317
[knocking]

09:41.232 --> 09:43.017
Hey, Calvin.
Hey, Dave.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.715
I just wanted to come over and
make sure everything was okay.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.369
I feel really bad
about last night.

09:47.412 --> 09:50.285
Why? Because I won?
[laughs]

09:50.328 --> 09:53.201
Don't hate the player,
hate the game.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.377
I think you're
saying that wrong.

09:55.420 --> 09:58.859
Hey, what's up, Dave?
You ready to go, Pop?

09:58.902 --> 10:01.601
Wait. So, you
guys are okay?

10:01.644 --> 10:03.603
Yeah, why wouldn't we be?Yeah.

10:03.646 --> 10:04.908
Come on, let's go.

10:04.952 --> 10:08.564
Oh!

10:08.608 --> 10:10.697
Would you get that
game out of here

10:10.740 --> 10:12.960
before Marty turns
into a potato head?

10:17.660 --> 10:21.098
Hey, uh, Marty, can
I ask you something?

10:21.142 --> 10:23.057
Now is not a good time, Dave.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.711
My wagon is stuck in a ditch,

10:24.754 --> 10:26.800
and my wife
Lorelei's water just broke.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.890
Well, it's just

10:29.933 --> 10:32.893
that your dad and Malcolm got
into a huge fight last night,

10:32.936 --> 10:35.156
and now they seem
completely fine.

10:35.199 --> 10:36.940
Yeah, that's what they do.
Things blow up,

10:36.984 --> 10:39.595
they ignore it and pretend
like it never happened.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.249
Well, has it always been
like that?

10:41.292 --> 10:43.643
No, it started when Malcolm
stopped playing baseball.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.819
I didn't know he
played baseball.

10:45.862 --> 10:50.040
Yeah, well, I didn't know
wolves could eat my baby.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.131
Why'd he stop?

10:54.175 --> 10:57.091
Uh, he, um, he got injured
in the minors.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.093
It kept him from making it
to the big leagues.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.747
Oh, man,
he must have been crushed.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.662
Yeah, so was my dad.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.359
Baseball was their thing.

11:06.753 --> 11:10.234
You know, maybe since they can't
connect over baseball anymore,

11:10.278 --> 11:13.281
I can get them to connect
over a different game.

11:13.324 --> 11:16.676
[laughs]
Well, it can't be this one,

11:16.719 --> 11:19.243
because it is ruining my life!

11:21.550 --> 11:23.378
Thank you so much
for coming with me.

11:23.421 --> 11:24.814
Are you kidding?

11:24.858 --> 11:27.948
White girl returning a bag
she stole 20 years ago--

11:27.991 --> 11:29.732
nothing on TV
better than this.

11:29.776 --> 11:33.649
I just want to set a good
example for Grover, you know?

11:33.693 --> 11:35.390
I don't want him thinking
I'm a hypocrite.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.087
Eh, all good parents
are hypocrites.

11:37.131 --> 11:38.785
My boys think
I'm at church right now.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.615
I have kind of a
weird situation,

11:43.659 --> 11:45.574
and I know it's gonna
sound a little crazy,

11:45.617 --> 11:47.881
but I need to return
a backpack I stole

11:47.924 --> 11:50.622
from one of your
stores in 1998.

11:50.666 --> 11:53.321
I get it.
When my uncle got sober,

11:53.364 --> 11:55.366
he had to make amends, too.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.760
Oh, no, no, no, I'm
not getting sober.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.720
Mama needs her wine.

12:00.763 --> 12:03.635
I'm just trying to
return this backpack.

12:03.679 --> 12:05.681
Okay, maybe you should
take it back

12:05.725 --> 12:07.727
to the store
that you stole it from.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.859
[laughs] Well, to do that,

12:09.903 --> 12:13.167
I'd need Marty, Doc Brown,
and a DeLorean.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.473
I don't know
what any of those things are.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.693
Listen, Meadow, I have
a six-year-old son,

12:17.737 --> 12:19.390
and I lied to his face.

12:19.434 --> 12:22.045
I need to return this backpack
so I'm not a liar anymore.

12:22.089 --> 12:25.527
Because if a kid can't trust
his mom, he can't trust anyone.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.790
So you are gonna take
this damn backpack

12:27.834 --> 12:30.010
and help me save my baby boy.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.359
Okay, let me, uh,

12:31.402 --> 12:33.883
handle this. Hi, Meadow.

12:33.927 --> 12:36.712
All my friend here needs
to do is return that bag,

12:36.756 --> 12:39.584
so what is the best way
to resolve this situation?

12:39.628 --> 12:42.718
I'm sorry. I can't
resolve anything for you.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.546
Well, I hear you say that,

12:44.589 --> 12:47.767
but I don't feel like
you really tried.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.900
[chuckles]Whoa, there's no need
to be aggressive.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.990
I'm not being aggressive.

12:54.034 --> 12:56.079
I don't appreciate your tone.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.995
My tone? Th-Th-There's
nothing wrong with my tone.

12:59.039 --> 13:00.388
I was just trying
to help my friend.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.999
Security? I've got a situation

13:03.043 --> 13:04.740
with a very angry woman

13:04.784 --> 13:06.786
and her blonde friend
from the '90s.

13:06.829 --> 13:09.614
Oh, my God,
she just called you angry.[scoffs]

13:09.658 --> 13:12.400
Tina, I don't know
if you realize this,

13:12.443 --> 13:14.924
but you are being profiled.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.708
Oh, my God, Gemma.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.406
I think you might be right.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.538
Well, I am not
just gonna stand here

13:20.582 --> 13:22.453
and watch you be disrespected.

13:22.497 --> 13:25.892
See, now you're
upsetting my customer.

13:25.935 --> 13:29.286
Oh, you want upsetting?
I will show you upsetting.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.680
Okay. All right,
let's go, Angela Davis.

13:31.723 --> 13:34.639
You're gonna get me arrested.You may not realize it,

13:34.683 --> 13:36.076
but you should be ashamed
of yourself.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.425
Y-You need to get woke!

13:37.468 --> 13:38.992
She's black, and I'm proud!

13:39.035 --> 13:40.036
Okay.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.560
Okay.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.867
Hey, guys.

13:44.911 --> 13:47.522
Who's up for some cornhole?

13:47.565 --> 13:49.741
Did you get beat
up a lot as a kid?

13:49.785 --> 13:51.047
Not as much as everybody thinks.

13:51.091 --> 13:52.440
[chuckles]

13:52.483 --> 13:54.790
Wait, wait, guys, hold on.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.010
You guys should really talk
about your issues.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.490
If you don't want
to do it for yourselves,

13:59.534 --> 14:01.144
do it for me.

14:01.188 --> 14:05.366
That is the least
compelling reason to do it.

14:05.409 --> 14:06.454
Hey, Dave, look,

14:06.497 --> 14:08.282
it's cool, man. We're fine.

14:08.325 --> 14:11.111
Yeah.Look, I-I know, as a man,

14:11.154 --> 14:13.809
how hard it is to talk
about our feelings.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.290
I wish it was harder for you.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.206
Marty told me
about how your problems started

14:19.249 --> 14:21.077
when Malcolm stopped
playing baseball,

14:21.121 --> 14:23.471
and I think maybe it's because

14:23.514 --> 14:26.778
alpha males, like us...

14:28.868 --> 14:31.914
...sometimes use sports
to connect emotionally.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.655
Guys, it's not healthy

14:33.698 --> 14:35.048
to keep having these blowups

14:35.091 --> 14:36.832
and pretend
like they never happened.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.834
You know, you're suppressing
your feelings.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.618
Suppressing our feelings? No.

14:40.662 --> 14:43.143
We don't suppress anything
around here. Right, Malcolm?

14:43.186 --> 14:44.796
I...See, I told you.

14:45.797 --> 14:48.191
I think Dave is right.What?

14:49.192 --> 14:50.846
I think Dave's
right. We should...

14:50.890 --> 14:52.630
play the game and talk.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.632
About what?

14:54.676 --> 14:56.330
About how you talk to me.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.158
How you disrespect me.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.160
Look, I-I'm sick of it, man.

15:00.203 --> 15:03.337
Oh. Oh, so you're the one
sick of something?

15:03.380 --> 15:04.904
Yeah, Pop, I'm sick of it.

15:04.947 --> 15:07.907
Huh.Okay. Okay.

15:10.431 --> 15:13.869
See, now we're communicating.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.958
Who wants to throw
the first beanbag?

15:16.002 --> 15:17.438
If you don't get your ass
out of here,

15:17.481 --> 15:18.787
you're gonna be
the first beanbag.

15:18.830 --> 15:21.572
Let the healing begin.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.445
You feeling better now?

15:24.488 --> 15:26.795
Yes.

15:26.838 --> 15:29.754
I just can't believe
she treated you like that.

15:29.798 --> 15:32.975
I told you, it happens
all the time. But...

15:33.019 --> 15:35.282
maybe this time we can
use it to our advantage.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.240
How?Follow my lead.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.373
You drop the goods, and
I'll handle the rest.

15:39.416 --> 15:42.593
Okay. I'm just gonna have
this other Cinnabon first.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.249
How do you not have an ass?

15:48.425 --> 15:51.428
♪

16:14.234 --> 16:16.236
♪

16:38.519 --> 16:39.824
Ka-kaw! Ka-kaw!

16:40.869 --> 16:43.002
[laughs] You followed
the wrong one.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.743
And you couldn't handle
the '90s.

16:49.921 --> 16:53.099
All right. Go ahead, big man.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.622
Say what you got to say.

16:54.665 --> 16:58.104
Well, Dave said playing the game
will help us to do it.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.757
[sighs] Fine.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.543
Yeah.There. Go.
We're playing.

17:02.586 --> 17:05.328
Oh, damn, I made it.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.289
You know what,
just forget about it, Pop,

17:09.332 --> 17:10.986
'cause you're not gonna
listen to me, anyway.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.814
There you go.

17:12.857 --> 17:15.686
Quitting 'cause you lost.
Classic Malcolm.

17:15.730 --> 17:18.167
Had enough of you
talking to me like that.Mm.

17:18.211 --> 17:19.603
Ever since I stopped
playing baseball,

17:19.647 --> 17:21.040
you treat me like I'm a bum.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.259
Well, ever since you
stopped playing baseball,

17:23.303 --> 17:25.131
you been acting like a bum.

17:25.174 --> 17:26.828
What am I supposed to do, Pop?

17:26.871 --> 17:28.482
J-Just get some job

17:28.525 --> 17:30.875
and forget that I was
ever good at baseball?

17:30.919 --> 17:33.313
I did 6:00 a.m. workouts
every day,

17:33.356 --> 17:36.011
took batting practice
till my hands bled.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.145
I gave everything I had
to baseball.

17:39.188 --> 17:43.105
Worked my ass off
chasing my dream and...

17:43.149 --> 17:45.890
just for my arm
to go out on me, Pop.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.329
You have any idea
how unfair that is?

17:49.372 --> 17:52.027
What you want me
to say, Malcolm?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.029
Life is unfair.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.683
But what are you gonna do?

17:55.726 --> 17:57.859
Just sit in the
living room all day

17:57.902 --> 17:59.208
and guard the damn furniture?

18:06.172 --> 18:08.348
Do you see what
I'm saying, Pop?

18:08.391 --> 18:10.437
Why do you have to
come at me like that?

18:10.480 --> 18:12.439
I'm trying to get you
to fight, son.

18:12.482 --> 18:13.701
I don't want to
fight with you.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.355
I don't want you
to fight with me.

18:15.398 --> 18:16.834
I want you to fight back.

18:16.878 --> 18:17.966
Fight back at what?

18:18.009 --> 18:19.750
At life.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.448
I'm trying to motivate you, son.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.145
Pop, when you tear
me down like that,

18:23.189 --> 18:25.060
it doesn't motivate me.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.281
It just makes me feel like...

18:28.324 --> 18:30.283
like I'm worthless.

18:32.807 --> 18:35.201
Worthless?

18:35.244 --> 18:37.725
You're my son.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.596
There's nothing worthless
about you.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.078
Malcolm, I loved
watching you play baseball.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.168
And you know why?
Because you were fearless.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.865
You dove for every ball,

18:47.909 --> 18:50.390
you always took
that extra base,

18:50.433 --> 18:53.349
and you never struck out
without swinging at the pitch.

18:53.393 --> 18:56.047
You always went down swinging.

18:56.091 --> 18:59.312
That's because when I
was a kid, you told me

18:59.355 --> 19:02.184
if I didn't try my hardest,
I would have to walk home.

19:02.228 --> 19:05.579
Yeah, you remember that time
you had to walk home

19:05.622 --> 19:07.146
in a thunderstorm?[chuckles]

19:08.799 --> 19:11.759
How can I forget?
It was an away game.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.197
Look, son,

19:15.241 --> 19:17.199
but these last couple
of years,

19:17.243 --> 19:19.201
you've been caught looking.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.205
You need to start
swinging again.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.729
I know, Pop.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.731
But at what?

19:27.775 --> 19:30.734
Anything. I mean,
a swing and a miss

19:30.778 --> 19:33.650
is always better
than no swing at all.

19:35.739 --> 19:38.742
Well, maybe you're right.

19:38.786 --> 19:41.223
It is time for me
to start swinging again.

19:41.267 --> 19:44.095
Yeah. And, look,
I may be tough,

19:44.139 --> 19:46.272
but I always got your back.

19:46.315 --> 19:50.363
Well, I would appreciate it,
Pop, if you would just...

19:50.406 --> 19:53.279
cut down on the
jabs a little bit.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.977
[chuckles] Okay.
All right, I can do that.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.545
So what you thinking,
like five jabs a week?

19:58.588 --> 20:00.242
[laughs]

20:00.286 --> 20:01.983
How about two, Pop?

20:02.026 --> 20:03.376
Okay, three it is.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.639
Deal.

20:05.682 --> 20:08.511
I'm-a do you one better.
Come here, man.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.647
Love you, boy.

20:13.690 --> 20:16.084
Love you.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.260
Oh, damn.What?

20:18.304 --> 20:21.785
Did Dave's little cornhole plan
work on us?

20:21.829 --> 20:23.047
It sure did.

20:30.316 --> 20:34.058
Well, all right.
So, y'all are starving,

20:34.102 --> 20:36.147
but my oxen are yoked.
