00:03.540 --> 00:06.460
We robbed our boss, Al.
I know you took the money!

00:06.500 --> 00:13.340
We only took 50 grand. The Fairhaven
account is missing Â£500,000.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.380
How could you lie about this?
I did it for us!

00:16.420 --> 00:19.220
I can clean the money...
He's your uncle! Asian uncle!

00:19.260 --> 00:22.820
You gave all our money
to a complete stranger?

00:22.860 --> 00:27.660
I've kept all records of our dodgy
dealings on just one laptop - yours!

00:27.700 --> 00:31.420
The accounts on your husband's
laptop are now central to our case.

00:31.460 --> 00:34.580
We have no option but to report him
to the police.

00:34.620 --> 00:36.220
This time tomorrow
we could be pregnant!

00:36.260 --> 00:38.580
If you watch the screen, all done.

00:38.620 --> 00:42.260
Deacon Mendez. I am arresting you
for the obstruction of justice.

00:43.020 --> 00:44.020
Allison!

00:50.620 --> 00:51.620
(DEEP SIGH)

00:56.100 --> 01:01.620
No comment. I've got no comment,
so...

01:01.660 --> 01:04.100
I don't think you can arrest someone
for not having a laptop!

01:04.140 --> 01:05.620
I need to speak
to my fucking lawyer!

01:05.660 --> 01:08.820
I can't share this toilet!
I'll tell you about the money, OK?

01:08.860 --> 01:10.740
I'll even tell you about stuff
I've heard about!

01:10.780 --> 01:12.900
You can't expect somebody
to shit in there!

01:12.940 --> 01:14.100
(WAILS)

01:14.140 --> 01:15.820
Please, help me!

01:15.860 --> 01:18.860
I'll tell you about the money!

01:18.900 --> 01:21.740
(SCREAMS)

01:21.780 --> 01:24.620
(DOOR OPENS)
Calm down.

01:24.660 --> 01:27.460
You're free to go.
Your wife brought in the laptop.

01:28.140 --> 01:30.940
(CALMLY) Oh. OK.
What were you shouting about?

01:30.980 --> 01:31.980
Um... Nothing.

01:34.540 --> 01:36.460
(THEME MUSIC)

01:41.500 --> 01:42.540
Hey!

01:42.580 --> 01:46.020
Allison! (SOBS)
OK.Thank God!

01:46.060 --> 01:48.980
I just need you to sign to say
you've handed this over.

01:49.700 --> 01:51.940
What's that?
It's your laptop, dummy.

01:51.980 --> 01:54.580
Oh, so stressed,
you probably don't recognise it.

01:54.620 --> 01:55.620
Oh, yes. Yeah.

01:56.660 --> 01:58.540
Yeah, No. Yes, I am stressed.

01:58.580 --> 02:01.820
Thank you for my work laptop,
thank you.

02:01.860 --> 02:02.900
I'm obliged to ask.

02:03.940 --> 02:06.380
Do you actually feel safe
and fine to go home?

02:06.420 --> 02:08.260
Yeah. I feel perfectly safe.

02:08.300 --> 02:12.140
It's just, you were making some
frightening noises in your cell.

02:12.180 --> 02:15.180
Well, that is just how
I respond to pressure,

02:15.220 --> 02:20.180
just any kind of scary or surprising
scenarios and stuff like that.

02:20.220 --> 02:22.140
If I'm watching a horror film, even,
just, "Agh!"

02:22.180 --> 02:24.380
It's just like it's really full on.

02:24.420 --> 02:28.580
Actually, I got asked to go home from
kids' birthday parties because of -
That's enough.

02:28.620 --> 02:31.740
I'll just sign for this, thank you...
He was a bed wetter.

02:32.660 --> 02:35.020
'How did you even think of
a fake laptop?

02:35.060 --> 02:38.900
The question is, how did you and
Alfie NOT come up with the idea
of a fake laptop?

02:38.940 --> 02:42.220
And how have you been while I've been
away? I've been fine.

02:42.260 --> 02:43.980
No, do you know, I'm not fine.

02:44.020 --> 02:48.060
Really? Why not? Apart from
the, you know, prison rescue.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.300
Aren't you worried that
maybe this is our life now?

02:50.340 --> 02:53.340
Trying to bring up a child
while dodging police and Alfie

02:53.380 --> 02:54.900
and you know
it's only a matter of time

02:54.940 --> 02:56.900
before they realise that laptop
isn't yours.

02:56.940 --> 02:59.260
Well look, this is a bump.
We get past this,

03:00.420 --> 03:02.180
we start our normal life, all right?

03:02.220 --> 03:04.260
Since we took the money,
we haven't had a normal DAY.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.820
Well, why don't we make this
our first one, all right?

03:06.860 --> 03:08.740
I'll drop you off, I'll go
and get some nice food

03:08.780 --> 03:12.420
and we'll have a lovely evening
and you'll feel reassured. All right?

03:12.460 --> 03:14.980
OK. Just so you know,
it won't lead to anything,

03:15.020 --> 03:16.660
cos my boobs are super tender.

03:17.420 --> 03:19.780
Oh, well, don't worry. Mine are too.

03:19.820 --> 03:20.820
See you in a bit.

03:27.500 --> 03:31.500
OK, Es, what the hell is this?
Relax, just some corporates for Jed.

03:31.540 --> 03:33.780
They promoted him
and they're giving him loads of work

03:33.820 --> 03:35.780
and he asked
if I could store some of it.

03:35.820 --> 03:38.900
What did he get promoted to?
Criminal henchman two?

03:38.940 --> 03:40.860
Why are you drinking so much water?

03:40.900 --> 03:43.460
Because I have set an alarm for when
I can take my first pregnancy test

03:43.500 --> 03:44.940
and I don't wanna be out of ammo.

03:44.980 --> 03:46.620
You have to hose
the pregnancy test down?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.900
Maybe I'm stress hydrating.
Is that a thing?

03:48.940 --> 03:52.660
What have you gotta be stressed
about? You're living a perfect life.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.500
What's that supposed to mean?

03:54.540 --> 03:57.300
Well, you've got your perfect
straight-laced husband,

03:57.340 --> 03:59.060
and then you're gonna have
your perfect baby

03:59.100 --> 04:01.420
and then you're gonna be all set up
and you can carry on judging

04:01.460 --> 04:02.980
my choices and feel better than me.

04:03.020 --> 04:05.380
That's not what I'm doing and
if it makes you feel any better,

04:05.420 --> 04:07.940
I'm struggling with a lot of my life
choices at the minute too.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.860
Are you?

04:09.900 --> 04:11.940
Maybe. I don't know.

04:11.980 --> 04:13.380
Let me know where
you end up on that

04:13.420 --> 04:15.300
so I know whether or not
I'm welcome here.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.980
Es, it's not like that.
Well let me ask you this.

04:18.020 --> 04:21.380
Do you think there is room in this
house for me AND a baby?

04:21.420 --> 04:24.020
Maybe if we get rid of some of
these boxes.

04:24.060 --> 04:25.060
(MUMBLES)

04:30.340 --> 04:33.380
Mr Bauer, your company is run
like a sixth-form tuck shop.

04:33.420 --> 04:34.620
Your accounts are a total mess,

04:34.660 --> 04:37.420
there are several highly suspicious
transactions.

04:37.460 --> 04:39.500
We believe money is being
filtered illegally.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.860
Oh, fuck off, Poirot.
You've got nothing.

04:43.100 --> 04:46.420
Show me one dodgy account.
The Clyde Fund. Bardwick Centre.

04:48.700 --> 04:52.140
Fairhaven Account. Clarence Estates.
Did you say Fairhaven?

04:53.820 --> 04:56.060
Yes, we're still trying
to locate that one.

04:56.100 --> 05:00.300
A large part of the fund has been
transferred to a crypto wallet.

05:00.340 --> 05:04.540
You should be hearing from us soon,
as your colleague has handed in
his laptop.

05:04.580 --> 05:09.420
So now, we have everything we need.
Goodbye.

05:09.460 --> 05:11.420
Piss off.

05:13.580 --> 05:14.580
(SIGHS)

05:25.300 --> 05:26.380
(SCREAMS)

05:26.420 --> 05:28.020
So, you've just got to relax,

05:30.740 --> 05:32.620
stay calm during this bit, OK?

05:32.660 --> 05:35.460
Let me look after you
and you can look after the embryos.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.660
Are you sure you're gonna be cool
at work today?

05:37.700 --> 05:39.500
Yeah. Do you know what,
I actually think I will.

05:39.540 --> 05:43.780
I feel sort of different
since I went inside.

05:43.820 --> 05:45.340
Deacon, you spent one night
in a room

05:45.380 --> 05:47.420
marginally less comfortable
than a Travelodge.

05:47.460 --> 05:49.340
Yeah, OK, fine,
but it did toughen me up a bit.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.620
Well, I'm happy for you.
Shall we go?

05:51.660 --> 05:54.620
And you can tell me what
it must have been like for Mandela.

05:57.260 --> 06:00.860
I definitely had too much coffee.
My heart feels mad.

06:00.900 --> 06:04.340
Deacon, what the fuck? OK, I know
I said that we had to remain calm

06:04.380 --> 06:06.860
and I was gonna look after you,
but do not leave me alone with him!

06:06.900 --> 06:08.940
I thought you'd toughened up?
Not that much. Please?

06:08.980 --> 06:12.380
OK.Thank you. Deacon? I wanna
speak to you on my own right now.

06:13.620 --> 06:15.220
He can't.
Why?

06:15.260 --> 06:17.860
Well, because I have a women's
issue.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.780
I feel I need my husband's
second opinion on it.

06:19.820 --> 06:20.940
What?

06:20.980 --> 06:24.260
Well, it's embarrassing if
I spell it out in front of everyone.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.220
Well, what is it?
What is it?

06:28.420 --> 06:31.340
It's a vaginal discharge,

06:31.380 --> 06:33.860
consistency that I am unfamiliar
with at this point in my cycle.

06:33.900 --> 06:37.340
I would expect in my luteal
phase to have like a milky,

06:37.380 --> 06:40.980
low flow, but it's an egg white -
Enough shared info. Talk to Tina.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.500
(MOUTHS) Sorry.

06:45.540 --> 06:48.140
So, how would you like me
to kill you? Um, sorry?

06:50.500 --> 06:56.060
You gave them the laptop,
you penis colada. Now we are fucked.

06:56.100 --> 06:59.260
OK. The laptop's not a problem, OK?
I gave them a dummy.

07:00.780 --> 07:01.780
Really?
Yeah.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.900
(LAUGHS) You might actually have
a brain.(SIGHS)

07:07.340 --> 07:09.740
How did you come up with that one?
Well, to be honest with you,

07:09.780 --> 07:11.540
it felt like a pretty obvious move.

07:11.580 --> 07:14.340
Look, I've got stuff to be
getting back on with, so..

07:14.380 --> 07:15.940
You're not going anywhere.

07:17.980 --> 07:18.980
You see...

07:20.300 --> 07:21.540
I... have been robbed.

07:24.780 --> 07:28.300
What? The Fairhaven account is
missing half a million quid.

07:32.740 --> 07:34.780
Holy shit.
It's just gone. Vanished.

07:36.700 --> 07:39.200
But I'm gonna find out who took it,
so help me God.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.020
Only a small amount of people
could have pulled this off,

07:43.060 --> 07:45.380
and once I have whittled down
the suspects

07:46.860 --> 07:49.060
and discovered who it is,

07:49.100 --> 07:53.180
I'm gonna take them to the rooftop,
I'm gonna dangle them over the edge,

07:53.220 --> 07:57.140
I'm gonna get them to explain to me
how they did it and then...

07:58.420 --> 08:01.180
I'm gonna fucking drop 'em off and -
Can I go to the toilet, please?

08:01.220 --> 08:03.580
What?
I=I need to go to the toilet.

08:03.620 --> 08:06.900
After what I've just told you,
you want to go to the toilet?

08:06.940 --> 08:09.220
I've got IBS
and I had potatoes last night

08:09.260 --> 08:11.940
and they're sitting a bit funny
and I don't feel good.

08:11.980 --> 08:15.740
You're not going anywhere
until we find out who had access
to that account.

08:15.780 --> 08:18.700
Look, I'll shit myself!
What's become of you lately?

08:19.620 --> 08:21.780
Look, go and have your shit, right?

08:21.820 --> 08:25.220
But be quick, I want you back
here A-S-fucking-A-P.

08:25.260 --> 08:27.580
Yeah. I won't even wipe.
You better not!

08:28.260 --> 08:31.780
What the fuck are we going to do?
Calm down. It's actually good news.

08:31.820 --> 08:33.220
Um, how is this good news?

08:34.060 --> 08:36.940
Well, if he knows the money is gone
and he's told you,

08:36.980 --> 08:39.980
then obviously he doesn't think
there's any chance it WAS you,

08:40.020 --> 08:42.860
and that's good. But he wants me
to help investigate it.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.340
I absolutely do not have
the acting jobs for that.

08:45.380 --> 08:48.300
Deacon, you can do this.
Really?

08:48.340 --> 08:50.420
I was just deeply unconvincing
I needed to go for a shit.

08:50.460 --> 08:53.300
This would definitely have been
less of an issue if it was 50 grand.

08:53.340 --> 08:57.740
He might not have even cared.
Sorry, do you want me to cry?

08:57.780 --> 09:00.900
Is that what you want?
Are you thinking, "You know what?

09:00.940 --> 09:03.140
I'm gonna say the worst thing
I can possibly think of,

09:03.180 --> 09:04.820
he's gonna cry
and then I'll feel amazing"?

09:04.860 --> 09:06.820
OK, OK. I have a plan.

09:06.860 --> 09:10.540
I'm gonna go with you, talk
to Alfie, get him to let you go.

09:10.580 --> 09:13.060
Then we go to Kethan
and we get the rest of our money

09:13.100 --> 09:14.540
so we're ready to leave
if we have to.

09:14.580 --> 09:16.420
All right? There's no need to cry.

09:16.460 --> 09:18.620
(SOBS) You've given up on us
having a normal life!

09:18.660 --> 09:20.500
No. No, I haven't.

09:20.540 --> 09:22.940
It's just we gotta get through this
first, OK? OK.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.780
But I am sorry what
I said about crying.

09:24.820 --> 09:27.620
It's a perfectly normal human
reaction. Men can cry.

09:30.380 --> 09:34.460
Just not now, please, because time
is against us, so lock it up.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.540
Yeah, sure, OK. What exactly are you
gonna tell Alfie?

09:37.580 --> 09:39.620
I think I knew who took the money.

09:39.660 --> 09:44.100
Really? Yes. I'm almost certain
it was Sally.

09:44.140 --> 09:47.060
She was always talking to her team
about how much she resented you,

09:47.100 --> 09:50.380
about how you didn't deserve to be
where you are,

09:50.420 --> 09:52.900
that it should be her, and then
toward the end of her time here,

09:52.940 --> 09:58.180
she would talk about finally finding
a way to get what she deserved.

09:58.220 --> 10:01.220
Fucking hell. I can't believe it.
No.

10:01.260 --> 10:05.340
I always thought she fancied me!
That might have been part of it.

10:05.380 --> 10:07.580
It would drive any woman mad knowing
she couldn't have you.

10:07.620 --> 10:11.340
That horny bitch.
Right, well, we've got to find her.

10:11.380 --> 10:14.980
(GASPS) Deacon, maybe you could
go through her computer,

10:15.020 --> 10:18.380
look for some clues or something?
Oh yeah, definitely, yeah,
I could go into her computer.

10:18.420 --> 10:21.740
I'll get the log in from someone
and log in

10:21.780 --> 10:25.980
and then look around her computer
and go into her -

10:26.020 --> 10:27.980
You OK? Have you shit
your brains out or something?

10:28.020 --> 10:29.860
No. Sorry. Sorry.

10:29.900 --> 10:33.260
I want no stone left unturned. Yeah?
We're gonna find her

10:33.300 --> 10:36.700
and then I am gonna make her pay.

10:36.740 --> 10:39.020
I don't mean sexually.

10:39.510 --> 10:41.590
OK, so we go in, we beg Kethan
to give us all our money back

10:41.630 --> 10:43.590
and he'll say no
and then we threaten to grass him up

10:43.630 --> 10:45.470
and he'll buckle or turn us into
tikka masala.

10:45.510 --> 10:47.030
Whoa, whoa. Listen.

10:47.070 --> 10:49.790
I know I give you shit about not
being good at this sort of stuff,

10:49.830 --> 10:51.630
but I really do think
you can do this.

10:51.670 --> 10:54.430
Right? Come on.
Yeah, OK. Yeah, OK.Whoo! Come on.

10:54.470 --> 10:57.750
Yeah, project normal life, yeah?
Yeah. Yeah, OK.

10:58.830 --> 11:00.910
What is the problem, exactly,

11:00.950 --> 11:04.310
that is so urgent that I had to stop
everything I am doing to hear it?

11:04.350 --> 11:08.790
Well, as you know, we have this
arrangement where you pay us

11:08.830 --> 11:11.470
our money in instalments, or not,
depending on if you feel like it.

11:11.510 --> 11:14.790
Don't be rude. No, I was just trying
to summarise the situation,

11:14.830 --> 11:17.390
but basically
we need all of our money.

11:17.430 --> 11:19.070
OK, but that was always true,
wasn't it?

11:19.110 --> 11:22.270
Why should I give a shit now?
We're actually quite desperate.

11:22.310 --> 11:25.910
Listen, I ain't got time for this
one-line trickle=trickle
information bullshit, yeah?

11:25.950 --> 11:28.950
Just tell me the whole story.
I wanna help.

11:28.990 --> 11:31.070
OK, well, we think that it's only
a matter of time

11:31.110 --> 11:32.830
before Alfie finds out
what we've done

11:32.870 --> 11:35.150
and we kinda don't wanna be around
when he does.

11:35.190 --> 11:38.150
So we need to get the money
so we can leave the country
and start somewhere else.

11:38.190 --> 11:43.670
(SNIFFS) OK, so what is clear is
that you are in a lot of trouble.

11:43.710 --> 11:50.270
Hm? And you've been honest and
up front in telling ME that.Yeah.

11:51.350 --> 11:54.070
(CHORTLES)

11:54.110 --> 11:55.110
(BOTH LAUGH)

11:56.630 --> 11:58.870
I've been messing you guys about.

11:58.910 --> 12:01.670
It's actually incredibly easy for me
to give you the full amount.

12:01.710 --> 12:05.790
Really? Of course. Look. (LAUGHS)
I've got your money.

12:05.830 --> 12:08.310
I can easily give it
all to you right now.

12:08.350 --> 12:11.950
That is amazing.
Hold on, no. I haven't finished.

12:13.070 --> 12:15.790
I've actually decided
I ain't gonna give you anything.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.910
I'm sorry?
No need to apologise.

12:18.950 --> 12:21.310
You see, the way I see it, either
the police or Alfie

12:21.350 --> 12:24.670
are gonna come and get you,
and that's not to mention the fact

12:24.710 --> 12:29.310
you told me you murdered that
horny woman and her boyfriend.

12:29.350 --> 12:31.390
Either way, I don't care.

12:32.670 --> 12:38.550
What that means is, I don't
have to give you... anything.

12:40.550 --> 12:42.190
But Uncle...
(LAUGHS)

12:42.230 --> 12:44.830
Don't uncle me, dickhead.
I'm not your uncle.

12:44.870 --> 12:47.150
I wouldn't wanna BE your uncle.

12:47.190 --> 12:50.350
Why did you tell me the truth,
dickhead? Haven't you seen Ozark?

12:51.030 --> 12:53.150
You should have told me
there was a business opportunity

12:53.190 --> 12:54.950
for me to invest in or something.

12:54.990 --> 12:57.390
You're a dickhead.
But we're in real trouble.

12:57.430 --> 12:58.990
Allison might be pregnant,

12:59.030 --> 13:00.550
we're worried
we're gonna go to prison.

13:00.590 --> 13:03.790
We're just asking for our money back!
No, you're not.

13:03.830 --> 13:06.990
You're asking me for my money
that I took from you.

13:07.030 --> 13:10.350
I'm getting quite frustrated at
how stupid you're being.

13:10.390 --> 13:14.470
Listen. You got involved in
something you had no business doing.

13:14.510 --> 13:18.870
The only person I actually feel
sorry for in all of this is you,
Allison,

13:18.910 --> 13:22.790
getting your life entangled
with this useless piece of shit.

13:22.830 --> 13:24.870
Now, fuck off.

13:28.150 --> 13:31.030
(LAUGHS AND GIGGLES)

13:35.750 --> 13:36.870
(CHUCKLES)

13:40.070 --> 13:41.830
(WAILS)

13:41.870 --> 13:43.270
(SCREAMS)

13:43.310 --> 13:46.510
I HAVE seen Ozark, you prick!
Allison, fill up the bag!

13:46.550 --> 13:49.390
What is your exit strategy here?
Huh?

13:49.430 --> 13:52.330
You're gonna have to kill me
to get away with this. (WAILS)

13:52.830 --> 13:56.030
As if I'd ever let you
near my mother, you fucking pervert!

13:56.070 --> 13:58.870
(CRIES)I'm gonna stick this
in your fucking dick.

14:00.470 --> 14:03.150
I'm gonna let go of this knife
and then we're gonna run like hell.

14:03.190 --> 14:07.710
OK? One, two, three.

14:07.750 --> 14:12.670
(GRUNTS IN AGONY)
Fuck you!

14:12.710 --> 14:15.390
You should have killed me!

14:17.670 --> 14:20.150
Oh my god, that was unbelievable.
What the...

14:20.190 --> 14:24.110
There is so much money in here.
There's way more than 500 grand.

14:24.150 --> 14:26.990
I feel like I've got a lot of oxygen
in me and I don't like it.

14:27.030 --> 14:29.670
Deacon, I knew you could do it, but
what happened to the blackmail plan?

14:29.710 --> 14:32.510
I just knew we needed the money,
he said he was gonna give us nothing

14:32.550 --> 14:35.750
and then I remembered when you picked
up that letter opener at Alfie's

14:35.790 --> 14:38.550
and I thought, "Oh God, that was so
sweet you were willing to do that."

14:38.590 --> 14:40.430
And I thought,
"I wish I could do that for us."

14:40.470 --> 14:42.950
Then I saw the knife
and I thought "Why don't I stick it
in his hand?"

14:42.990 --> 14:45.790
Yeah, well he's gonna be furious,
so we have to leave today. Today?

14:45.830 --> 14:47.590
Yes!
I thought we were gonna plan?

14:47.630 --> 14:50.270
Oh, Deacon,
you turned his hand into a kebab.

14:50.310 --> 14:52.950
We need to go. If he catches us,
he's gonna torture us.

14:52.990 --> 14:55.750
We go home, pack our shit
and then get the hell outta here.

14:55.790 --> 15:00.070
OK, OK. But we are gonna have
that normal life, Allison. Oh fuck.

15:00.110 --> 15:01.830
What? You don't want a normal life?

15:01.870 --> 15:04.990
No, I've left my fucking injections
in the fucking office. Shit.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.950
It's fine, it's fine, OK?
We're gonna whizz home,
you're gonna run in,

15:07.990 --> 15:09.670
drop the money off,
so it's not on us,

15:09.710 --> 15:11.870
then we're gonna go into work and
pick up the injections

15:11.910 --> 15:13.830
all casual, hopefully everyone
will have left,

15:13.870 --> 15:15.750
and then we're gonna start
our normal life.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.110
Fine, but can we make a rule
that in our normal life

15:18.150 --> 15:20.350
we do not keep saying the words
"normal life"?

15:20.390 --> 15:23.310
Yeah, absolutely. It's starting
to annoy ME as well.

15:26.030 --> 15:27.150
(GRUNTS)

15:36.870 --> 15:39.030
Oh.
What's going on?

15:39.070 --> 15:41.350
Oh,
I just needed to grab a lipstick.

15:41.390 --> 15:43.550
You came home to get a lipstick?
Yeah.

15:43.590 --> 15:47.040
I've got a meeting and I thought it
was important to look presentable.

15:47.390 --> 15:50.630
You're acting super weird.
No, I'm not.
I've just gotta get back to work.

15:50.670 --> 15:52.590
You acted like this before.
I don't have time.

15:52.630 --> 15:54.780
You said that then too.
Jesus, leave it, Es.

15:56.550 --> 15:59.510
Sorry, I just have to go
sort this thing at work quickly

15:59.550 --> 16:01.750
and then I will come back here
and we can have a proper chat.

16:01.790 --> 16:03.510
OK? I promise. I'm here for you.

16:05.310 --> 16:06.830
I'm right here.
OK.

16:17.550 --> 16:19.870
Do you know where they are?
Yeah, in here.

16:19.910 --> 16:23.710
So, how are you two?
Any joy with Sally?

16:23.750 --> 16:27.710
No, not yet, we were just about to go
into the emails and have a look.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.630
Can I have a quick chat
with you both?

16:30.670 --> 16:32.790
Yeah, sure. What's it about?

16:32.830 --> 16:35.190
I think I've found proof that
Sally took the money.

16:35.230 --> 16:38.630
Really? What is it?
Come in my office, I'll show you.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.630
Make yourselves comfortable.

16:46.790 --> 16:48.790
Oi, what are you doing?
Alfie, what the fuck?

16:48.830 --> 16:51.270
I know you took that money!
What? No we didn't!

16:51.310 --> 16:53.950
Sally didn't take it,
and you know she didn't.

16:53.990 --> 16:55.910
I came looking for you two
and I couldn't find you.

16:55.950 --> 16:59.230
So I spoke to the girls about what
Sally had been saying about me.

16:59.270 --> 17:02.950
Now, apart from an issue
with my personal hygiene,

17:02.990 --> 17:04.550
they didn't know what
I was talking about.

17:04.590 --> 17:08.590
So I thought
"Who has got the experience
and the access to pull this off?"

17:08.630 --> 17:13.790
So I followed the electronic trail
and it led me to you two!

17:16.470 --> 17:18.350
Well, I'm sorry, Alfie,
you gave us no choice.

17:18.390 --> 17:21.510
I fucking knew it!
I didn't even have any evidence.

17:21.550 --> 17:24.870
Do you think I'd follow
an electronic trail? You twat!

17:24.910 --> 17:27.230
Deacon, what the fuck?
OK, that was bad.

17:27.270 --> 17:31.030
I want my money back NOW!
Why don't you just fuck off, Alfie?

17:31.070 --> 17:32.550
I beg your fucking pardon?

17:32.590 --> 17:35.030
Has it ever occurred to you that
the reason we took the money

17:35.070 --> 17:37.070
is cos you never paid us the bonus
you were supposed to,

17:37.110 --> 17:38.590
despite having shit tons of money?

17:38.630 --> 17:42.590
It's no excuse for ripping off 500K
from your friend.

17:42.630 --> 17:45.310
You're not a friend, you bell end!

17:45.350 --> 17:47.590
You're some twat that I had to be
nice to make working for you

17:47.630 --> 17:50.150
slightly less hellish
than it normally is.

17:50.190 --> 17:52.950
We took money that you owed us
already, plus a little bit more

17:52.990 --> 17:55.470
because I was caught up in the
moment and there was money

17:55.510 --> 17:57.270
and I was thinking...
It was spur of the moment.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.510
I'm bored of this.
Do you see what this is?

18:00.550 --> 18:05.870
This contains a back-up of all
the dodgy accounts from your laptop.

18:05.910 --> 18:09.350
There's enough on here
to put you away

18:09.390 --> 18:11.150
and end this investigation.

18:11.190 --> 18:15.270
Wo why don't both of you make
yourselves comfortable

18:15.310 --> 18:19.790
and I'll be back with the police?
It's false.

18:19.830 --> 18:22.670
You're a piece of shit, Alfie.
Yeah.

18:25.310 --> 18:26.470
This is a fucking nightmare!

18:26.510 --> 18:30.670
Why did you admit it?
Everyone knows you never admit it.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.350
It's the Shaggy principle.
Can we focus on the moment
when I was a legend

18:33.390 --> 18:35.270
and stood up to Kethan and got us
a load of money?

18:35.310 --> 18:37.750
Money that's on top of our wardrobe
while we're trapped in here

18:37.790 --> 18:39.550
because you can't grasp
the basic concept

18:39.590 --> 18:41.350
of plausible deniability.
(PING)

18:41.390 --> 18:45.910
What's that?
It's time to take a pregnancy test.

18:45.950 --> 18:50.110
(PING)
Oh. What a fairytale.

18:50.150 --> 18:52.350
I can't imagine
a more perfect setting

18:52.390 --> 18:56.150
than while imprisoned by the man
you robbed for $500,000.

18:56.950 --> 18:59.630
I'm sorry, what are you doing?
I'm taking a pregnancy test.

18:59.670 --> 19:00.910
Well, can't you just wait?

19:00.950 --> 19:03.590
No. The alarm goes off,
I take a test. Well, how?

19:03.630 --> 19:06.430
I'm going to piss on Alfie's chair.

19:06.470 --> 19:10.190
OK, I actually fully support that,
but I also do not want to watch it.

19:12.390 --> 19:14.470
(SIGHS)
(PEES)

19:15.550 --> 19:19.670
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.

19:19.710 --> 19:22.910
This can't be how you imagined
things would go.

19:22.950 --> 19:26.150
Well, no, but, you know,
once we get past this, you know,

19:26.190 --> 19:29.390
things will get easier
and we should be all right.

19:29.430 --> 19:31.190
How many times
are we gonna say that?

19:31.230 --> 19:34.870
We couldn't even manage
two days of normality.

19:34.910 --> 19:37.870
This was supposed to be us
setting up a nice life,

19:37.910 --> 19:41.030
but instead
we set up a life on the run.

19:42.910 --> 19:45.270
What... What are you saying?

19:46.910 --> 19:50.670
I don't know.
I'm just saying what I'm saying.

19:53.790 --> 19:55.870
(SIGHS)

19:58.430 --> 20:02.310
What's it say?

20:02.350 --> 20:04.150
Not pregnant.

20:08.670 --> 20:12.070
I'm gonna be absolutely honest.
I think I'm kind of relieved.

20:24.110 --> 20:25.750
What are you doing?

20:25.790 --> 20:28.630
Well, Kethan is gonna looking for
us, so Esme is in danger.

20:28.670 --> 20:30.110
We have to get the money
before he does

20:30.150 --> 20:32.910
and we have to get out of here
before the police come for us,

20:32.950 --> 20:34.830
so...
Ooh.

20:36.270 --> 20:38.230
(ALARM WAILS)
Holy shit!

20:39.150 --> 20:41.800
I'm afraid Allison and Deacon
are at work. Can I help?

20:44.790 --> 20:47.390
I've come for my million pounds.
