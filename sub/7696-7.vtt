WEBVTT

01:21.581 --> 01:22.623
<i>...has escaped today.</i>

01:22.999 --> 01:26.711
<i>He is armed and considered
extremely dangerous. If seen...</i>

01:26.836 --> 01:31.090
Oh, swell. Some nut makes trouble,
and for that, they preempt the ballgame.

01:31.465 --> 01:33.217
Perfect ending to an awful day.

01:33.634 --> 01:35.428
Boss turns me down for a raise,

01:35.678 --> 01:37.054
our kid needs braces,

01:37.346 --> 01:39.473
and Bonnie's making meatloaf for dinner.

01:41.350 --> 01:44.437
At what point exactly
did I become life's punching bag?

01:48.357 --> 01:49.483
Huh?

01:50.776 --> 01:52.028
What's their hurry?

02:03.873 --> 02:04.957
Sheesh.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.084
Go on, push me aside, big shot.

02:07.418 --> 02:10.463
No reason anyone should move over
and make way for Charlie Collins.

02:13.633 --> 02:14.634
Hey!

02:16.052 --> 02:18.471
Oh, that's it. No signal, no nothing.

02:18.554 --> 02:20.097
Just treat me like I don't exist.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.850
Sorry, comrade. Not this time.

02:34.445 --> 02:35.446
Hey,buddy.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.406
Yeah, I'm talking to you, clown.

02:37.698 --> 02:39.325
You think you own the whole road?

02:39.742 --> 02:40.993
Why, for two cents, I'd...

02:41.911 --> 02:42.953
Huh?

02:55.549 --> 02:56.801
That was The Joker.

02:56.884 --> 02:58.469
I cussed out The Joker.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.528
Oh.

03:16.904 --> 03:17.947
Oh.

03:34.588 --> 03:35.798
Where'd all the cops go?

03:55.651 --> 03:57.403
Go, go, go.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.905
Come on, come on.

04:22.344 --> 04:23.971
There's your two cents.

04:24.263 --> 04:26.932
Now, what are you going to do to me?

04:27.683 --> 04:29.393
Listen, I'm sorry, really.

04:29.518 --> 04:30.811
I had a bad day.

04:30.978 --> 04:32.104
Boss turned down my raise and...

04:32.188 --> 04:34.482
Now, look, my rude friend.

04:34.982 --> 04:38.527
We can't have people cursing
at each other on the freeway.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.197
It's simply not polite.

04:41.864 --> 04:42.907
Ahh!

04:45.201 --> 04:48.329
I'm just going to have to teach you
some manners.

04:50.956 --> 04:51.957
Please don't.

04:52.124 --> 04:53.125
I have a family.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.503
A wife, a little boy. Please.

04:55.586 --> 04:56.837
I'll do anything to make it up.

04:56.921 --> 04:57.922
Anything.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.842
"Anything," says you?

05:03.052 --> 05:04.094
Uh-huh.

05:04.762 --> 05:05.930
Okey-dokey.

05:10.643 --> 05:11.644
Wallet.

05:15.397 --> 05:18.275
Sure. I don't have much cash.

05:18.359 --> 05:21.612
Oh, please. Don't insult me.

05:24.031 --> 05:28.202
"Charles Michael Collins." That's you.

05:28.452 --> 05:29.495
Lousy picture, though.

05:29.578 --> 05:30.621
Lousy.

05:30.871 --> 05:33.874
"Address, height, weight."
Blah, blah, blah.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.210
Righty-o, Chuckers.

05:36.335 --> 05:37.419
Here's the deal.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.088
I'll let you off,

05:39.171 --> 05:43.133
if you promise to do
a little favor for me.

05:44.426 --> 05:46.303
Okay. What?

05:46.637 --> 05:48.138
I don't know!

05:48.222 --> 05:50.266
I haven't thought of it yet.

05:51.559 --> 05:56.146
You just toddle on back to your mundane,
meaningless little life,

05:56.230 --> 05:58.941
and when I need you, I'll call.

05:59.024 --> 06:00.025
Fair?

06:00.109 --> 06:01.777
Good. Great!

06:01.902 --> 06:02.987
I'll be in touch.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.836
It's a waste
of time, money and manpower.

06:18.919 --> 06:21.046
If I had the authority to block it,
I would.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.840
Come on, Commissioner.

06:22.923 --> 06:25.634
It's free eats,
and you get your picture in the paper.

06:25.718 --> 06:26.886
It's a good deal.

06:32.641 --> 06:36.270
"Testimonial in honor
of Police Commissioner, James Gordon.

06:36.562 --> 06:39.565
"Tuesday night,
the Gotham Peregrinators Club."

06:40.149 --> 06:41.567
Blasted waste of time.

06:42.192 --> 06:44.069
Most of the force
would disagree with you.

06:44.528 --> 06:47.072
If anyone should be
getting a testimonial, it's you.

06:47.531 --> 06:48.741
I'm just the night shift.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.577
You deal with this mess 24 hours a day.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.412
That's what those people want to honor.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.831
Okay, okay. What the heck.

06:56.081 --> 06:57.833
It's a fancy club, good food.

06:57.917 --> 06:58.918
Could be fun.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.837
You don't know where
I can rent a tux, do you?

07:04.465 --> 07:05.841
I hate it when he does that.

07:12.473 --> 07:15.309
I arranged another early parole,

07:15.392 --> 07:18.687
as soon as I heard
about Gordon's testimonial.

07:18.771 --> 07:19.980
Phoo!

07:20.606 --> 07:22.942
It is to laugh, huh, Mr. J?

07:26.695 --> 07:28.489
I ask you, Harley,

07:28.614 --> 07:33.661
who's given more hours of amusement
to the Gotham Police Force than me?

07:34.078 --> 07:35.579
No one, Mr. J.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.498
I deserve...

07:37.581 --> 07:42.586
Nay. Demand the right
to honor our dear commissioner as well.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.171
Hear, hear.

08:01.814 --> 08:02.898
Huh?

08:06.777 --> 08:07.987
Oh!

08:10.823 --> 08:12.908
Gonna call in a specialist, boss?

08:13.367 --> 08:14.368
No, no.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.328
Just an old friend,

08:16.745 --> 08:19.039
who's dying to do me a favor.

08:34.513 --> 08:36.765
Good one, Kenny.

08:37.224 --> 08:38.434
Go out for a long bomb.

08:42.604 --> 08:43.605
I got it.

08:46.859 --> 08:47.860
Hello?

08:47.943 --> 08:50.070
<i>Hello, Charlie.</i>

08:50.738 --> 08:52.114
Wrong number, pal.

08:52.197 --> 08:53.532
My name is Don.

08:53.615 --> 08:54.825
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

08:54.950 --> 08:58.746
<i>This is the right number,
Charles Michael Collins.</i>

08:58.829 --> 09:01.957
I don't know why
you changed your name to Don Wallace

09:02.166 --> 09:05.169
and moved your family
to 12 Marigold Lane,

09:05.294 --> 09:07.296
Springdale, Ohio.

09:07.379 --> 09:11.884
One might think you were trying
to skip out on our little deal.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.552
Leave the sideburns.

09:15.220 --> 09:16.221
How did you find me?

09:16.305 --> 09:19.308
Oh, I never lost you, Chaz.

09:19.391 --> 09:21.935
You've become my hobby.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.233
Now, listen up, Charlie Brown.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.861
<i>You're booked on the next flight
to Gotham.</i>

09:31.236 --> 09:33.947
Tell the family you have to visit
a sick friend.

09:34.239 --> 09:37.826
Oh, and let's keep this
to ourselves, okay?

09:38.786 --> 09:42.247
<i>Bad things happen to people who gossip.</i>

09:42.331 --> 09:44.500
<i>Capisce, Carlo?</i>

09:46.168 --> 09:47.169
Yeah.

09:47.252 --> 09:49.004
<i>Good. See you.</i>

10:02.142 --> 10:05.354
<i>Gotham Air flight 32,
now arriving from Springdale.</i>

10:07.689 --> 10:08.941
<i>This is crazy.</i>

10:09.024 --> 10:10.484
<i>I can't believe I'm doing this.</i>

10:17.366 --> 10:18.617
<i>If only I had some way to,</i>

10:18.700 --> 10:20.869
<i>I don't know, call him.</i>

10:42.141 --> 10:44.810
The car is this way, Charlie.

10:50.190 --> 10:52.234
Jumping Jiminy Christmas!

10:52.693 --> 10:54.403
Charlie Collins!

10:54.486 --> 10:56.238
It's been forever.

10:56.613 --> 10:58.115
How are you, man?

10:58.198 --> 10:59.575
You look great.

10:59.658 --> 11:01.118
Lost a little weight.

11:01.201 --> 11:03.996
Lost a little hair, too.

11:04.079 --> 11:06.081
Oh, Charlie.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.167
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

11:09.376 --> 11:13.213
So, ready to do me that little favor?

11:14.047 --> 11:16.633
Please, don't make me hurt anyone.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.094
Not to worry, Chuckers.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.763
As soon as you've done my favor...

11:21.847 --> 11:24.057
<i>...I'll send you right back home.</i>

11:24.141 --> 11:25.601
<i>I promise.</i>

11:28.687 --> 11:30.856
Okay, Chaz.

11:30.939 --> 11:34.902
When Harley knocks on the door
three times, you open it.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.487
- And?
- That's it.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.823
Wait. That's the favor?

11:40.324 --> 11:42.284
You called me here just to open a door?

11:42.367 --> 11:45.287
Well, look at the size
of that cake, man!

11:45.454 --> 11:47.998
She can't open the door
and push it in all at once!

11:48.582 --> 11:49.583
Think!

11:51.793 --> 11:53.128
He is nuts.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.350
Not bad.

12:10.520 --> 12:11.730
Congratulations, Jim.

12:11.813 --> 12:13.607
I'm sorry I won't be
able to stay for dinner.

12:14.107 --> 12:16.735
Hmm. The life of a busy socialite.

12:16.860 --> 12:18.445
Any way I could sneak outwith you?

12:25.953 --> 12:28.580
<i>A room filled with cops,
and no way to warn them.</i>

12:34.378 --> 12:36.964
<i>If there were just some way
to call Batman.</i>

12:50.644 --> 12:52.771
Oh... No way.

12:53.146 --> 12:54.439
It'd never work.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.024
Not in a million...

12:56.108 --> 12:57.109
Well, maybe.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.953
Not staying for dinner, sir?

13:08.078 --> 13:09.830
Not with The Joker on the loose.

13:10.247 --> 13:13.500
Sir, I believe you may be needed inside.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.751
Huh?

13:18.797 --> 13:22.801
I'm honored that
Gotham's finest turned out to rub elbows

13:22.884 --> 13:25.220
with this tired old beat cop.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.726
You eating that roll, Montoya?

13:30.809 --> 13:32.477
I'm really, very touched.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.693
And I'll conclude by saying...

13:39.776 --> 13:41.361
Don't stop now, Jimmy.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.280
The party's just starting!

13:49.119 --> 13:51.913
Baby doll. Entertainment.

13:55.917 --> 13:57.002
<i>Hey, sugar.</i>

13:57.085 --> 13:58.879
You want to read me my rights?

13:59.379 --> 14:02.007
You have the right to remain silent.

14:04.926 --> 14:05.927
Jerk.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.479
Oh.

14:30.744 --> 14:33.622
Here's to Gotham's Commissioner G.

14:33.955 --> 14:37.542
You lock up the weirdos,
the crooks and the geeks.

14:37.959 --> 14:40.879
You're a hero to all the boys in blue.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.923
But this time, baby,

14:43.006 --> 14:44.841
the joke's on you.

15:08.281 --> 15:09.282
Yes!

15:09.366 --> 15:13.328
Another stunning Joker entrance
leaves the crowd speechless.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.914
Let's hear it for him, folks.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.464
Gee! Tough audience.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.094
Commissioner!

15:29.511 --> 15:32.514
I'm here to present you
with a small token of affection,

15:33.014 --> 15:36.935
from me and all the guys
doing 25 to life.

15:44.818 --> 15:46.611
Wear it in good health,

15:46.695 --> 15:48.989
all remaining 59 seconds of it.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.992
Toodles.

15:55.787 --> 15:58.373
Wait. You promised to send me home.

15:58.498 --> 16:00.917
I never said alive.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.962
You dirty, evil...

16:06.298 --> 16:09.426
Sayonara, sucker.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.159
Batman!

16:34.451 --> 16:36.870
The commissioner's medal, it's a bomb!

16:48.006 --> 16:51.968
Guess I'll need a new hobby,
now that old Charlie is... Pfft!

16:52.302 --> 16:53.470
Macramé's nice.

16:57.432 --> 16:58.725
That came from outside!

16:59.267 --> 17:00.810
Rocko! Henshaw!

17:00.936 --> 17:02.562
I smell a bat!

17:02.938 --> 17:04.356
Quick! To the van!

17:05.524 --> 17:07.442
Uh, Mr. J.

17:10.195 --> 17:13.156
Okay. We'll tough it out here.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.577
He called you his hobby?

17:17.702 --> 17:18.703
Yeah.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.289
For two years,
he watched me like a bug in a jar.

17:21.414 --> 17:23.750
Watched and laughed,
and threatened my family.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.002
I had no choice, Batman, really.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.261
The gas is wearing off.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.595
Stay with the cops.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.302
I know. You're thinking,

18:15.427 --> 18:16.469
"What a shame.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.431
"A pure, innocent little thing like her

18:19.514 --> 18:22.392
"led astray by bad companions."

18:25.478 --> 18:27.397
Right. Tell me another.

18:32.402 --> 18:36.156
Oi! Beauty school is starting to look
pretty good about now.

18:57.260 --> 19:00.430
Ingenious, the way they reconstructed
this temple.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.307
Completely accurate,

19:02.390 --> 19:05.226
right down to the poison-tipped darts.

19:12.150 --> 19:16.029
The drop-away floor
is a nice touch, too. Hah!

19:28.041 --> 19:30.210
Catch!

19:46.393 --> 19:47.394
Hold it!

19:48.144 --> 19:51.106
Oh, come on!

19:51.189 --> 19:52.774
I said, hold it!

19:59.114 --> 20:01.241
You miserable little nobody!

20:01.574 --> 20:05.537
If I get caught,
your wife and son are history!

20:05.912 --> 20:08.373
You're not getting caught,
not this time.

20:08.623 --> 20:10.583
I found this blown out of the van.

20:11.167 --> 20:12.544
This is how it ends, Joker.

20:12.711 --> 20:13.878
No big schemes,

20:14.003 --> 20:16.214
no grand fight to the finish
with the Dark Knight.

20:16.631 --> 20:18.717
Tomorrow, all the papers will say,

20:18.842 --> 20:21.970
"Is that the great Joker was found
blown to bits in an alley,

20:22.095 --> 20:24.347
"alongside a miserable little nobody?"

20:25.223 --> 20:27.434
Kind of funny. Ironic, really.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.311
See, I can destroy a man's dreams, too.

20:30.437 --> 20:33.481
And that's really the only dream
you've got, isn't it?

20:33.815 --> 20:36.484
Look, Charlie. You've had a busy day.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.069
All this running around,

20:38.153 --> 20:41.406
all this excitement with...
...Batman!

20:41.614 --> 20:44.159
Stop. You're crazy.

20:44.242 --> 20:46.327
I had a good teacher.

20:46.786 --> 20:48.580
Say good night, Gracie.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.752
Batman! Batman!

20:55.754 --> 20:57.380
How long have you been there?

20:58.131 --> 20:59.340
Long enough.

20:59.799 --> 21:01.009
Put it down, Charlie.

21:01.384 --> 21:03.136
You know he'll just escape again.

21:03.386 --> 21:05.472
This is the only way
my family stays safe.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.557
All right. You win. Take it easy.

21:07.640 --> 21:11.186
Here's everything on his blasted family.
Names, addresses, it's all there.

21:14.481 --> 21:17.025
You're no fun anymore, Charlie.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.485
Hey, Joker.

21:24.991 --> 21:26.075
Huh?

21:33.291 --> 21:34.292
Gotcha.

21:36.294 --> 21:40.673
Oh. Very funny. A million laughs.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.675
Go home, Mr. Collins.

21:43.134 --> 21:46.095
Home. I never thought
that could sound so good.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.181
Wonder what Bonnie's making for dinner.

21:48.723 --> 21:50.225
Right now, anything would taste great.

21:50.809 --> 21:51.976
Even meatloaf.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.218
