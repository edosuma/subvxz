YOUNG SHELDON #521
"White Trash, Holy Rollers
and Punching People" Closed captioned

00:01.000 --> 00:02.450
Previously on Young Sheldon...

00:02.460 --> 00:04.080
Your brother's
gonna have a baby.

00:04.310 --> 00:05.400
Are they getting married?

00:05.400 --> 00:06.400
It would be better for them

00:06.400 --> 00:07.860
and better for the baby.

00:07.860 --> 00:09.150
And better for you
so your church friends

00:09.150 --> 00:10.530
don't get bent out of shape.

00:10.530 --> 00:12.280
If you ever
need anything, call me.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.910
I've already been through this
with my daughter, so...

00:14.910 --> 00:16.910
I know how to do it wrong.

00:16.910 --> 00:19.540
Thanks.

00:19.540 --> 00:22.000
I'm worried that if he doesn't
marry this girl,

00:22.000 --> 00:24.540
the congregation's
gonna turn on me.

00:24.540 --> 00:25.670
Hey, Joan.

00:25.670 --> 00:26.790
I just wanted to make sure that

00:26.790 --> 00:28.420
you knew Bible study was today.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.880
Susan, just making sure
everything's okay,

00:30.880 --> 00:32.840
since you're not at Bible study.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.340
Of course. No problem.

00:34.340 --> 00:35.880
I understand.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.100
Hey, it's Mary.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.560
Do you have time to talk?

00:39.560 --> 00:42.020
For you, always.

00:48.230 --> 00:49.860
Hey.
Hi.

00:49.860 --> 00:52.730
Thank you for meeting with me.
No problem. I got you

00:52.730 --> 00:56.030
coffee. You seemed upset,
so, donut holes.

00:56.030 --> 00:57.870
Which I love if you
don't want them.

00:57.870 --> 00:59.830
I'm good with coffee. Okay.

01:00.780 --> 01:02.490
So, what's going on?

01:02.490 --> 01:03.830
Well...

01:05.410 --> 01:07.920
...all the things that
I was afraid of

01:07.920 --> 01:09.170
are happening.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.380
Ever since word got out
about Georgie,

01:11.380 --> 01:14.630
everyone at my Bible study canceled.

01:14.630 --> 01:16.930
Well, first of all, that
sucks and I'm sorry.

01:16.930 --> 01:19.430
I also can't say I'm surprised.
This is the part

01:19.430 --> 01:20.800
of religion I don't like.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.640
I know Georgie made a mistake,

01:23.640 --> 01:26.940
but I thought, as Christians,
we're supposed to forgive.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.360
Well, I'm gonna ask you
a tricky question.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.320
If this were happening

01:33.320 --> 01:35.740
to someone else in
the congregation,

01:35.740 --> 01:37.820
how would you respond?

01:42.660 --> 01:44.660
Good choice.

01:44.660 --> 01:46.830
That'll help.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.790
Mm.

02:00.590 --> 02:02.220
What's going on?

02:02.220 --> 02:04.010
What's going on is people
are talking about my brother

02:04.010 --> 02:06.310
behind my back instead
of saying it to my face.

02:06.310 --> 02:08.230
She's talking about Georgie,
not me.

02:08.230 --> 02:09.520
People talk about me
behind my back,

02:09.520 --> 02:10.940
but it's about how smart I am.

02:10.940 --> 02:12.940
I'll say it to your face.

02:12.940 --> 02:15.190
Your brother's going to hell.

02:15.190 --> 02:16.610
No, he's not.

02:16.610 --> 02:18.700
Primarily because
hell isn't real.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.160
My mom said they should

02:20.160 --> 02:21.620
kick your whole family
out of the church.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.370
How about I kick your ass.

02:23.370 --> 02:24.870
I'd like to see you try.

02:25.990 --> 02:27.200
How about I help her?

02:27.200 --> 02:29.290
How about I go get Pastor Rob?

02:29.290 --> 02:32.500
Say one more thing about
my family and see what happens.

02:33.590 --> 02:34.840
Y'all are white trash.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.760
Whoa, what's going on here?

02:37.630 --> 02:40.630
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

02:40.630 --> 02:43.220
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

02:43.220 --> 02:45.640
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

02:45.640 --> 02:48.350
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

02:48.350 --> 02:52.600
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

03:00.820 --> 03:02.610
Pastor Rob should be here
any minute.

03:02.610 --> 03:04.120
Maybe if he was in the classroom
when he was supposed to be,

03:04.120 --> 03:05.580
none of this would've happened.

03:05.580 --> 03:08.160
You can't blame him
for Missy punching someone.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.660
If he was there to shut that kid
up, Missy wouldn't have had to.

03:10.660 --> 03:12.670
Sunday school is no place
for violence.

03:12.670 --> 03:15.170
The boy's parents
are very upset.

03:15.170 --> 03:16.340
Yeah, well so am I.

03:16.340 --> 03:17.500
Sorry I'm late.

03:18.510 --> 03:20.010
Hi.

03:20.010 --> 03:22.680
I'm Rob. Nice to meet you.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.760
Wish it were under
better circumstances.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.600
Oh, that's right,
you haven't met.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.520
No. But I've seen you around.

03:30.770 --> 03:34.400
So, shall we get to
the business at hand?

03:34.400 --> 03:35.860
Obviously, we're...

03:35.860 --> 03:38.440
mortified by Missy's behavior.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.240
Even though it sounds like
that punk had it coming.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.900
While his words
were out of line,

03:42.900 --> 03:44.530
it brings us to
the bigger issue,

03:44.530 --> 03:46.950
which is...

03:46.950 --> 03:48.990
people are talking
about Georgie.

03:48.990 --> 03:50.750
Bunch of holy rollers
with no lives.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.420
Well, we are a
tight-knit community,

03:53.420 --> 03:55.460
and sometimes that means
what happens to one of us

03:55.460 --> 03:56.880
affects all of us.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.880
Whether it's
their business or not.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.050
A-As Pastor Rob
helped me realize,

04:01.050 --> 04:03.090
if I were in their shoes,
I would have

04:03.090 --> 04:05.140
been judgmental myself.

04:05.140 --> 04:08.470
Well, it's a mess, and
something needs to be done.

04:08.470 --> 04:10.060
I'm glad to hear you
say that, because

04:10.060 --> 04:13.440
I was thinking that maybe
you could give a sermon

04:13.440 --> 04:16.610
reminding the congregation
what Jesus said about,

04:16.610 --> 04:20.070
um, judgment and forgiveness.

04:20.070 --> 04:21.740
Make it a teaching moment.
I like it.

04:21.740 --> 04:23.570
That's a way to go.

04:23.570 --> 04:26.530
But I was thinking,

04:26.530 --> 04:29.030
you've got a lot
going on right now.

04:29.030 --> 04:32.450
Maybe take some time off,
focus on things at home.

04:32.450 --> 04:35.620
Hold on. Are you firing her?

04:35.620 --> 04:39.290
No, no, just a little
leave of absence

04:39.290 --> 04:40.590
till things settle down.

04:40.590 --> 04:44.010
Is that really necessary?
I believe it is.

04:44.010 --> 04:45.930
As leaders of this church,

04:45.930 --> 04:47.470
we are held
to a higher standard.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.970
Are you asking us
to leave the church?

04:52.970 --> 04:54.560
Of course not.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.690
Y'all talk a big game
about community, and then

04:56.690 --> 04:58.940
you just turn your back when
things get a little messy.

04:58.940 --> 05:00.480
Okay, let's just take a breath.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.070
You do that. We're leaving.
Come on, Mary.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.950
George, let's talk this through.

05:04.950 --> 05:06.450
I've heard enough.

05:06.450 --> 05:07.990
I'll be in the truck.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.370
There must be another way.

05:18.380 --> 05:20.880
It's all right. I'll, um...

05:22.590 --> 05:24.550
...clean out my office.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.640
Movies lie.
Punching people hurts.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.480
Try being the punchee.

05:36.810 --> 05:39.350
What happened to you?

05:39.350 --> 05:40.860
Nothing.

05:40.860 --> 05:42.320
She punched a boy in the face
at Sunday school.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.610
Why?

05:43.610 --> 05:45.990
He was saying crap
about our family.

05:45.990 --> 05:47.740
Is this about me and Mandy?

05:49.110 --> 05:50.450
Yeah.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.330
You can't go around
hitting people.

05:52.330 --> 05:53.540
I had to do something.

05:53.540 --> 05:55.370
Me too.
What did you do?

05:55.370 --> 05:57.330
I ran and told
the nearest adult.

05:57.330 --> 05:59.170
I don't want you
getting in trouble for me.

05:59.170 --> 06:01.330
But Danny says
you're going to hell.

06:01.330 --> 06:04.170
I'm there now.

06:04.170 --> 06:06.010
Promise me.

06:07.010 --> 06:08.430
Fine.

06:08.430 --> 06:10.680
And I know you ain't
hitting nobody.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.550
You are correct, sir.

06:16.520 --> 06:17.930
Can we talk?

06:17.930 --> 06:21.900
Of course. Come in.

06:21.900 --> 06:24.770
So, I told my folks
about the baby.

06:24.770 --> 06:26.230
And?

06:26.230 --> 06:27.530
They told me I'm on my own.

06:27.530 --> 06:29.200
They want nothing to do with me.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.360
Sorry.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.700
Give it a minute, they
still might come around.

06:33.700 --> 06:37.200
I didn't even get to the part
where the father's 17 years old.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.410
Something fun for next time.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.800
Just join a new church, Mary.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.470
We're not
joining another church.

06:48.470 --> 06:50.550
Seriously?
After what we just went through,

06:50.550 --> 06:51.630
you want to go back there?

06:51.630 --> 06:53.470
I don't know.

06:53.470 --> 06:56.560
If we're switching religions,
may I recommend Judaism.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.220
Why?

06:58.220 --> 07:00.890
Both William Shatner
and Leonard Nimoy are Jewish.

07:00.890 --> 07:01.810
So?

07:01.810 --> 07:04.230
Isn't that enough?

07:04.230 --> 07:07.320
When Mary told me
she was pregnant,

07:07.320 --> 07:10.450
I reacted pretty much the
same way that your folks did.

07:10.450 --> 07:12.070
Not my finest moment.

07:12.070 --> 07:13.530
Let me guess, they got married

07:13.530 --> 07:15.160
and suddenly you were
okay with it.
Hell no.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.080
I didn't want
my daughter to marry

07:17.080 --> 07:18.910
that fat dumbass.

07:18.910 --> 07:20.960
I shouldn't have
said that.

07:20.960 --> 07:23.170
He got fat later.
I'd laugh,

07:23.170 --> 07:25.090
but my mom gained 70 pounds

07:25.090 --> 07:27.170
when she had my little brother.

07:27.170 --> 07:29.710
But I'll tell you something.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.180
Georgie's gonna
be there for you,

07:32.180 --> 07:33.970
whether you
like it or not.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.850
You may not know, but your feet
are gonna swell up.

07:35.850 --> 07:38.810
And your boobs. I'll rub
whatever you need rubbed.

07:38.810 --> 07:40.730
I'm getting that impression.

07:43.690 --> 07:45.110
What are you doing?

07:45.110 --> 07:47.190
Go to your room.
She's fine, Mary.

07:47.190 --> 07:48.650
She needs to
be punished.

07:48.650 --> 07:50.150
For what-- sticking up for us?

07:50.150 --> 07:52.950
She punched a boy in church.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.360
I'll just go to my room.

07:54.360 --> 07:55.950
Hey, don't you move.
What are you watching?

07:55.950 --> 07:58.160
MTV.
Watch MTV.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.950
George.
I'm not punishing her for
doing the right thing.

08:00.950 --> 08:02.960
Violence is never
the right thing.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.620
I'm sorry, are we in California?

08:04.620 --> 08:05.670
Ugh!

08:09.130 --> 08:11.010
Turn that off.

08:11.010 --> 08:13.930
So, you really think
my folks'll come around?

08:13.930 --> 08:15.470
I don't know 'em,

08:15.470 --> 08:18.140
but babies have a magical
power over people,

08:18.140 --> 08:19.890
especially grandparents.

08:19.890 --> 08:21.310
Is that how you felt
when Georgie was born?

08:21.310 --> 08:23.730
Oh, it was love
at first sight.

08:23.730 --> 08:26.350
And then 17 years later
he got me pregnant.

08:27.210 --> 08:28.300
You're not gonna
let that go, are you?

08:28.300 --> 08:29.420
Nope.
Hmm.

08:34.270 --> 08:36.400
Should you really be
reading in the car, baby?

08:36.400 --> 08:38.810
I'll be fine.
You sure?

08:38.810 --> 08:40.190
You're not the one
who'll have to

08:40.190 --> 08:41.980
clean up the oatmeal
back there.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.690
I said I'll be fine.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.950
And it's the blueberries
you should be worried about.

08:45.950 --> 08:48.120
Well, you're in a mood.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.120
Maybe because there was so much
bickering going on at home

08:50.120 --> 08:51.620
that I couldn't study.

08:51.620 --> 08:54.450
Oh, I'm sorry if
our family problems

08:54.450 --> 08:56.500
are getting in the way
of your schoolwork.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.290
I accept your apology.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.340
Oh...

09:02.340 --> 09:04.380
Yep, blueberries.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.800
Where you going?

09:06.800 --> 09:08.140
I got stuff to do.

09:08.140 --> 09:09.340
Like what?

09:09.340 --> 09:10.890
Just stuff.

09:10.890 --> 09:12.640
Well, can you stop
and get me something to eat?

09:12.640 --> 09:13.970
No.
Why not?

09:13.970 --> 09:15.430
'Cause I got stuff to do.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.730
Which you won't tell me.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.350
'Cause it's none
of your damn business.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.980
Is it illegal?

09:19.980 --> 09:22.020
I'm not gonna play this game
with you, Georgie.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.360
Just give me the first letter.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.650
Goodbye.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.990
Please, leave.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.830
These people are so lost.

09:36.370 --> 09:37.920
Just a minute!

09:44.670 --> 09:46.300
Oh!

09:46.300 --> 09:47.840
Uh, Pastor Rob.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.510
You okay?

09:49.510 --> 09:52.140
Um... swallowed a Tic Tac.

09:52.140 --> 09:53.510
Well,

09:53.510 --> 09:55.220
I can barely
smell the smoke at all.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.430
What are you doing here?

09:57.430 --> 10:00.900
I just didn't like the way
things went down the other day,

10:00.900 --> 10:03.190
and I came to check on you.

10:04.190 --> 10:05.730
Aren't you kind.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.110
Can I come in?

10:07.110 --> 10:09.400
Oh, yeah, of course.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.120
Okay...

10:17.120 --> 10:19.410
marital status.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.460
Single.

10:22.420 --> 10:24.130
Mind your own business.

10:25.550 --> 10:27.380
Name of father.

10:27.380 --> 10:29.970
I can't write "Georgie,"
it sounds like he's 11.

10:29.970 --> 10:31.760
George Marshall Cooper.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.050
Marshall?
I didn't know that.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.260
Isn't it nice he can
still surprise you?

10:37.600 --> 10:40.190
Payment method.

10:40.190 --> 10:42.400
Don't see an option
for "bad check."

10:42.400 --> 10:44.310
You don't have health insurance?

10:44.310 --> 10:45.770
I don't even have
car insurance.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.110
How do you drive
without car insurance?

10:47.110 --> 10:48.490
Slowly.

10:50.070 --> 10:53.490
Don't worry about the money.
I got you.

10:53.490 --> 10:55.280
I can't ask you
to do that.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.870
You're not asking, I'm offering.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.290
Thank you.

11:04.420 --> 11:05.920
I knew it.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.420
What are you doing here?

11:08.420 --> 11:09.760
I asked her to be here.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.170
So, her and not me?

11:11.170 --> 11:12.470
Yeah.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.010
Don't make me come over there.

11:16.140 --> 11:17.510
How did you follow me?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.060
Wasn't hard. You can see that

11:19.060 --> 11:20.480
yellow Toyota from outer space.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.940
It is a Mazda.

11:21.940 --> 11:23.690
This is my baby, too.

11:23.690 --> 11:25.360
I think I should
be a part of this.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.400
You did your part, now git.

11:28.650 --> 11:32.150
Mandy, please.
I want to help.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.870
He can stay.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.030
Thanks.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.490
What can I do?

11:39.490 --> 11:40.790
Nothing.

11:40.790 --> 11:42.830
I can do that.

11:42.830 --> 11:45.830
I was struggling to focus
and needed help.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.880
Luckily, there was
someone on campus

11:47.880 --> 11:51.210
I could always count on
to lend a friendly ear.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.470
A second mom, if you will.

11:53.470 --> 11:54.760
What now?

11:54.760 --> 11:56.260
You said if I ever
had a problem,

11:56.260 --> 11:57.550
I could come to you
and you'd fix it.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.310
When did I say that?

11:59.310 --> 12:01.140
September 13th, 1991.

12:01.140 --> 12:02.480
You had just eaten
a poppyseed bagel

12:02.480 --> 12:03.810
and had one
stuck in your teeth.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.480
I'll take your word for it.

12:05.480 --> 12:06.770
It was right here.
How did it not

12:06.770 --> 12:08.320
make you crazy?
It made me crazy.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.690
What do you want?

12:09.690 --> 12:12.320
My family's falling apart.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.820
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Uh...

12:14.820 --> 12:16.160
what do you want me to do?

12:16.160 --> 12:18.200
Fix it.

12:19.160 --> 12:22.450
I just can't believe the church
turned its back on us.

12:22.450 --> 12:26.000
The church may have,
but God didn't.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.340
I don't feel His presence
right now.

12:31.340 --> 12:33.550
Well, let's
invite Him to join us.

12:34.260 --> 12:36.800
Oh, ok-okay.

12:41.430 --> 12:43.770
Heavenly Father, we
ask for Your guidance

12:43.770 --> 12:45.940
in these troubled
times. Please,

12:45.940 --> 12:48.440
watch over Mary Cooper

12:48.440 --> 12:49.900
and her family,

12:49.900 --> 12:52.480
let her know that though
this unborn child is

12:52.480 --> 12:54.610
out of wedlock, he
or she is a miracle

12:54.610 --> 12:58.030
in Your creation and should
be celebrated as such.

12:59.070 --> 13:02.910
Amen.

13:07.210 --> 13:08.920
What's going on here?
Uh, uh, praying,

13:08.920 --> 13:11.550
we're praying.
Just praying.

13:12.550 --> 13:14.090
Why aren't you in school?

13:14.090 --> 13:16.420
You told me not to punch
anyone else, so I left.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.300
Well...

13:18.300 --> 13:19.590
go to your room.

13:20.890 --> 13:22.760
I should probably go.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.980
Uh, of course. Um...

13:24.980 --> 13:26.940
thank you for stopping by.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.850
Of course. Thank you
for the tea and, uh...

13:30.940 --> 13:32.440
Bye.

13:33.570 --> 13:35.150
Mm-hmm.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
Mandy, the doctor'll
see you now.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.290
Where do you think you're going?

13:52.290 --> 13:53.750
Going to see the doctor.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.090
Not you.

13:55.090 --> 13:57.090
Why not me? I'm the dad. Georgie,

13:57.090 --> 13:58.590
please don't cause a scene.

13:59.630 --> 14:00.930
All right.

14:00.930 --> 14:02.300
I'll wait here for you.

14:09.770 --> 14:12.020
I'm the dad.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.500
I know I'm opening myself up

14:14.500 --> 14:15.880
for cheap shots, but

14:15.880 --> 14:17.300
I'm thinking about
getting a rug.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.590
Oh, they're called
hair systems now.

14:18.590 --> 14:20.010
My brother just got one.

14:20.010 --> 14:22.470
He went from bald to
Rick James like that.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.180
I'm just trying
to get back out there

14:24.180 --> 14:27.430
with the ladies. Wouldn't hurt
having something up here,

14:27.430 --> 14:30.270
you know, for them
to hold on to.
Good for you.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.480
Although the right gal
wouldn't care.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.650
Says the man who doesn't have
to put sunblock on his head.

14:35.650 --> 14:38.110
Hey, you heard
from George today?

14:38.110 --> 14:40.530
George. Cooper? No.

14:40.530 --> 14:42.870
You?
No.

14:42.870 --> 14:44.450
Hoping that he
would join us.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.290
Well, he's going through
a tough time at home,

14:46.290 --> 14:48.080
you got to cut him
a little slack.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.460
Are you done?

14:49.460 --> 14:50.960
I don't know.
What do you think?

14:50.960 --> 14:52.670
I can keep going.
Me too.

14:52.670 --> 14:55.880
You ever wonder how that Sheldon
kid wound up being so smart?

14:55.880 --> 14:58.970
Oh, you mean like was there
a genius pizza delivery guy

14:58.970 --> 15:00.340
or mailman in the mix?

15:00.340 --> 15:02.840
Exactly.
All right, that's enough.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.810
And for the record, my
grandfather was a brilliant man.

15:05.810 --> 15:07.470
Co-invented the traffic cone.

15:07.470 --> 15:09.850
Used to be wood,
he made it rubber.

15:10.730 --> 15:12.350
That's right.

15:12.350 --> 15:14.650
Where you going?
Home.

15:14.650 --> 15:16.960
This was fun,
let's do it again sometime.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.960
Kiss my ass.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.330
Think we cheered him up?

15:21.330 --> 15:22.780
Oh, yeah.

15:22.780 --> 15:24.690
I'm hoping for a boy,
but as long as it's healthy,

15:24.690 --> 15:26.070
that's all that matters.

15:27.730 --> 15:29.310
What are y'all having?

15:31.530 --> 15:34.600
Hey.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.150
How was your day?

15:36.150 --> 15:38.530
Swell. You?

15:38.530 --> 15:39.900
Oh, you know,

15:39.900 --> 15:42.280
a little boring
not having work to go to.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.360
Yeah, well, I'll trade you.

15:45.990 --> 15:48.030
Oh, Pastor Rob dropped by.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.700
Why?

15:50.700 --> 15:53.460
Just seeing how we were doing.

15:54.460 --> 15:56.130
You mean to see
how you were doing.

15:58.460 --> 16:01.050
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on, Mary, you...

16:01.050 --> 16:02.510
you're not fooling anybody.

16:02.510 --> 16:03.880
We were just praying.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.140
Is that what we're calling it?

16:05.140 --> 16:06.340
Yes, because that's what it was.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.550
All right.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.720
I've had enough of this.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.520
Where are you going?
I'm making dinner.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.190
Yeah, well, maybe
Pastor Rob'll eat it.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.400
George!

16:21.650 --> 16:23.320
Hello?

16:23.320 --> 16:25.610
Mrs. Cooper,
it's Linda Hagemeyer.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.910
Is everything okay?

16:26.910 --> 16:28.410
Well, I was hoping

16:28.410 --> 16:30.120
that you could tell me.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.750
Uh, Sheldon was
in my office earlier

16:31.750 --> 16:34.540
and was pretty upset
about the situation at home.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.790
What did he tell you?

16:36.790 --> 16:38.210
Nothing much, really, just

16:38.210 --> 16:40.380
that his parents
are fighting all the time,

16:40.380 --> 16:42.710
his older brother
got a girl pregnant

16:42.710 --> 16:44.720
and his sister
punched a little boy

16:44.720 --> 16:46.380
in Sunday school.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.600
Oh. Well...

16:50.140 --> 16:51.770
...it's been
a busy couple of days.

16:51.770 --> 16:55.390
Just, you know, life--
one thing after another.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.730
Oh, ain't that the truth.

16:57.730 --> 16:59.400
Anyway, I'm sure

16:59.400 --> 17:02.400
that you know this university
has invested quite a bit

17:02.400 --> 17:05.740
in Sheldon's progress,
and, uh, well,

17:05.740 --> 17:07.700
not to be critical, but...

17:07.700 --> 17:10.580
he didn't come to you
complaining about me.

17:10.580 --> 17:13.330
What are you saying?

17:13.330 --> 17:14.870
Are you saying that I'm not

17:14.870 --> 17:17.290
doing a good job as his mother?

17:17.290 --> 17:19.000
Because I am

17:19.000 --> 17:21.380
doing the best that I can
to hold this family together,

17:21.380 --> 17:23.760
and I am tired
of everyone blaming me.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.760
I have half a mind
to get in my car and drive until

17:26.760 --> 17:28.970
I run out of road and then
start my life over again

17:28.970 --> 17:30.430
with a different name.

17:30.430 --> 17:33.260
Okay. Sure.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.890
So, uh...

17:34.890 --> 17:37.890
sounds like you've
got a handle on this.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.560
So good to talk to you.
Um, have a lovely evening.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.610
You too!

17:52.370 --> 17:53.910
Oh...

17:58.080 --> 17:59.960
It's okay.

18:10.420 --> 18:11.950
Where's Dad?

18:11.950 --> 18:13.570
Well...

18:13.570 --> 18:14.950
He had to work late.

18:17.260 --> 18:19.390
Georgie, how was your day?

18:19.390 --> 18:20.760
Pretty good, actually.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.720
Me and Mandy
went to the baby doctor.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.520
She actually
wanted you there?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.650
Not at first,
but I wore her down.

18:26.650 --> 18:27.690
Let's say grace.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.230
Hang on, safety first.

18:29.230 --> 18:31.020
When are you
gonna get over that?

18:31.020 --> 18:33.240
I would think recent events
would make you value protection.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.530
Enough.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.410
Bless us, Lord,
for the food we are

18:36.410 --> 18:39.320
about to receive and bless
the hands that prepared it.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.780
And bless Mom.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.250
Thank you. Amen.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.580
Amen.
Amen.

18:45.580 --> 18:46.670
She's the hands
that prepared it.

18:46.670 --> 18:47.710
Your blessing is redundant.

18:47.710 --> 18:48.960
Let's eat.
