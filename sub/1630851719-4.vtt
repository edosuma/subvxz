WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.008
[rock music playing]

00:10.385 --> 00:11.678
[Erika] Good morning, guys.

00:11.761 --> 00:14.889
We are on our way up to Beverly Hills.

00:14.973 --> 00:18.476
Looking forward to learning
some more about the anatomy.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.104
We haven't had anatomy class
since what, middle school?

00:21.187 --> 00:22.731
-[Damon] Right.
-[Erika laughs]

00:22.814 --> 00:24.566
I feel I'm pretty good on anatomy,

00:25.108 --> 00:27.152
uh, being an artist and everything.

00:28.486 --> 00:29.654
But…

00:31.156 --> 00:33.158
[music continues]

00:40.248 --> 00:41.249
[assistant 1] On mark.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.084
[assistant 2] Thank you.

00:43.752 --> 00:44.586
Hi.

00:44.669 --> 00:47.672
[interviewer] Tell me
about your sex education.

00:47.756 --> 00:51.468
When it comes to your body,
do you feel it's lacking?

00:52.385 --> 00:54.721
Yeah. Anatomy-wise I wonder, like…

00:54.804 --> 00:56.681
Damon's always like,
"Your clit is really small."

00:56.765 --> 00:58.558
I'm like,
"Maybe something's wrong with it?"

00:58.641 --> 01:00.351
Like, maybe it's not big enough.

01:00.435 --> 01:03.146
Maybe it needs to come out more.
I don't know.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.898
We don't do foreplay very often.

01:04.981 --> 01:08.693
I don't know how to have orgasms
except for, like, with a vibrator.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.781
His parents are, like, wondering
why he doesn't have any babies and, like,

01:12.864 --> 01:16.826
what is he waiting for and, like,
why am I not giving them, basically?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.704
Like, am I gonna have an orgasm
before I have a baby? [laughs]

01:19.788 --> 01:22.373
Right? Who doesn't want to orgasm?
I mean, that would be awesome,

01:22.457 --> 01:25.960
and then maybe I would be like,
"Great, let's have sex all the time."

01:34.636 --> 01:38.181
Part of my discovery
as a somatic sexologist

01:38.264 --> 01:40.183
has been what is erotically possible.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.519
-So today we're gonna talk about arousal.
-Okay.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.313
Arousal and fertility are linked.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.648
-Learn something new?
-Yeah.

01:46.731 --> 01:47.607
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.911
-This is a vulva puppet. So…
-[Erika] Oh, wow.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.373
I like this one has 'cause
it has the structure of the clitoris.

02:03.456 --> 02:07.502
There was this story going on
about Erika's clitoris being small.

02:07.585 --> 02:08.419
[clicks tongue]

02:08.503 --> 02:11.256
And when anybody says
anybody's genitals are small,

02:11.339 --> 02:14.008
I often just think it's because
they're not being aroused.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.469
Size isn't necessarily what matters.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.805
Arousal is what matters.

02:18.888 --> 02:22.225
I wanted to educate them on,
"Here's her anatomy,

02:22.308 --> 02:24.185
here's how to work with her anatomy."

02:24.269 --> 02:25.854
What's interesting about anatomy is

02:25.937 --> 02:30.233
a lot of the vulva-bodied anatomy
got taken out of the textbooks.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.944
So, if you look at, like,
early 1800s, it's all in there.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.738
And then we go through
the Victorian era, and it disappears.

02:35.822 --> 02:40.034
They only kept the reproductive organs in,
so we lost a lot of the anatomy.

02:40.118 --> 02:43.204
And then the way things were named
also denotes shame.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.374
Even the nerve that innervates
all the external genitalia

02:46.457 --> 02:49.460
was called the pudendal nerve.
"Pudendal" means shame.

02:49.544 --> 02:50.378
-Oh, wow.
-Mm.

02:50.461 --> 02:55.091
So, studying sex and
studying the anatomy was shameful.

02:55.175 --> 03:01.264
Okay, so, outer labia, and these
can be big or small, all different sizes.

03:01.347 --> 03:04.350
As someone gets more aroused,
these start to pop out more.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.770
The inner labia start to come out
because there's swelling,

03:07.854 --> 03:09.772
and all of this poofs out more.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.525
This is the clitoral hood.

03:12.609 --> 03:18.239
So, similar to someone who's penis-bodied,
this would be the foreskin.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.782
-[Erika] Mm. Okay.
-Okay?

03:20.283 --> 03:24.245
Now, clitorises are sometimes
innies or outies.

03:24.329 --> 03:28.124
Like, sometimes the clitoris is
more in underneath the hood,

03:28.208 --> 03:31.461
and sometimes it's more out and exposed.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.213
And then we have arousal, right?

03:33.296 --> 03:36.507
Which is gonna change it,
make a little bit more exposure, right?

03:36.591 --> 03:38.134
The clitoris is gonna grow.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.221
-[Erika] Right.
-It's very similar to someone's penis.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.138
Okay?

03:42.222 --> 03:45.808
Then there's the shaft of the clitoris,
which is this whole piece here.

03:45.892 --> 03:49.520
And this is all erectile tissue
that engorges with blood.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.397
All this is also the clitoris.

03:51.481 --> 03:55.860
So, we have the clitoral legs,
which are in here.

03:55.944 --> 03:59.906
They wrap around… This is the vaginal
canal here, the clitoral legs, here.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.825
-[Erika] Okay.
-And then the vestibular bulbs or the…

04:02.909 --> 04:05.703
Some people call them
the clitoral bulbs as well.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.248
So there's all this internal
structure to the clitoris,

04:08.331 --> 04:10.917
which wraps around the vaginal canal.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.002
-I wanna show you the whole clitoris.
-[Erika] Okay.

04:13.086 --> 04:13.920
Okay.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.506
-That's the whole clitoris.
-[Erika] What?

04:16.589 --> 04:17.465
[laughs]

04:17.548 --> 04:19.384
-[Erika] Wow.
-It's a lot of tissue.

04:19.968 --> 04:23.221
-It's intimidating.
-We just give this part attention.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.180
[Damon] Mm-hmm.

04:24.264 --> 04:28.226
But you've got
all this tissue here to play with.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.270
-Wow.
-[women laugh]

04:30.353 --> 04:32.272
-[Damon] All right.
-Aren't we amazing?

04:32.355 --> 04:34.524
I know.
That's what I'm thinking right now.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.527
I'm like, "Jeez, women just get
more awesome every time."

04:37.610 --> 04:38.987
[Jaiya] So awesome.

04:39.070 --> 04:42.782
So, these are some of the landmarks today
that we're going to find on your body.

04:42.865 --> 04:45.994
How do you feel now about
me taking a look at your anatomy

04:46.077 --> 04:47.662
and helping him do some landmarks?

04:47.745 --> 04:48.830
Yeah, sounds great.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.081
-Thank you.
-Great. All right.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.917
I think particularly as women,

04:53.001 --> 04:54.919
the connection to our bodies opens up

04:55.003 --> 04:58.548
this beautiful pathway
for self-realization.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.801
And that's super important
in relationship and sex.

05:01.884 --> 05:02.885
Right.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.638
[Michaela] There's so much taboo
about touching your own body

05:05.722 --> 05:07.682
and exploring your own genitals,

05:07.765 --> 05:09.809
particularly in a woman's anatomy.

05:09.892 --> 05:13.271
So, I think there'll be a lot of learning.

05:13.354 --> 05:16.357
If we come out learning
something new, we're good.

05:16.858 --> 05:17.900
How about you two?

05:18.484 --> 05:20.278
I am a little nervous.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.946
Seeing that it will be on Netflix,

05:22.030 --> 05:26.034
it will be a very interesting experience
after it premieres.

05:26.117 --> 05:30.038
I don't know the kind of
negative backlash we will get from it,

05:30.121 --> 05:34.917
but I'm very, very excited about
the positive influence this will have.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.253
[Shandra] Yeah.
I feel nervous a little bit because

05:37.337 --> 05:40.089
growing up in
a Jehovah's Witness household,

05:40.173 --> 05:42.133
my mom would always make comments.

05:42.216 --> 05:45.345
One time, she was watching a show

05:45.428 --> 05:47.680
where there was, like,
a lesbian relationship,

05:47.764 --> 05:50.850
and she would make comments
like, "Oh, that's disgusting."

05:50.933 --> 05:53.394
And that would be ingrained in my brain.

05:53.478 --> 05:57.106
So, I grew up knowing that
this was, like, a wrong relationship

05:57.190 --> 06:00.318
and that I shouldn't explore
feelings like that ever.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.444
-Oh.
-I know.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.695
-[Gwyneth] Mm.
-[Michaela] Aw.

06:02.779 --> 06:08.201
Uh, so, it's…
Yeah, it's painful 'cause… I mean…

06:09.077 --> 06:09.952
[sighs]

06:10.453 --> 06:13.831
She's my mom and one of
the most important people in my life, but…

06:13.915 --> 06:15.500
[sobs] Uh…

06:15.583 --> 06:19.712
Like, she has made it very clear
that she will not be at our wedding, so…

06:20.296 --> 06:21.589
I'm sorry.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.216
[Shandra] It's okay.

06:23.299 --> 06:24.884
[sniffles] Whoo. And…

06:24.967 --> 06:26.219
[chuckles]

06:26.302 --> 06:27.178
[inhales deeply]

06:27.261 --> 06:30.056
[exhales] Okay. Breathe. All right.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.518
So, I'm looking to gain more confidence

06:33.601 --> 06:35.061
to be more open

06:35.978 --> 06:39.524
without worrying about
what my family thinks

06:39.607 --> 06:42.985
or what my mother has in store for us.
[chuckles]

06:44.695 --> 06:47.865
I've known I was gay
since the beginning of time.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.034
Like, I definitely knew,

06:50.118 --> 06:52.995
and it was funny 'cause
I'd tell my mom I had crushes on girls,

06:53.079 --> 06:54.956
and she'd be like, "Hmm. Ha. No."

06:55.039 --> 06:56.082
"No, you don't."

06:58.668 --> 07:00.837
-So, I tried to push those feelings…
-Yeah.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.673
…to the back, as far as they can go.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.760
And, I mean, the older you get,
the harder it is to suppress that.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.681
I'm very excited to get out
of my comfort zone and talk about it

07:11.764 --> 07:13.641
a lot more and a lot more openly.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.353
I'm just very reserved
when it comes to sex.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.983
Something that
I do struggle with is penetration.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.026
It is painful sometimes for me.

07:24.110 --> 07:28.573
I don't automatically get
that pleasure like most women do.

07:28.656 --> 07:34.328
I think that's a big thing that's
kind of been a strain with each other,

07:34.412 --> 07:40.084
and so that's a big thing that
I want to work on with myself, but yeah.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.002
Yeah.

07:50.344 --> 07:53.055
Much in the same way
that you had an experience

07:53.139 --> 07:54.974
of being with the entirety of your body,

07:55.057 --> 07:59.020
we're gonna now hone in
on a very special part,

07:59.103 --> 08:00.104
your vulva.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.899
[soft percussive music playing]

08:11.866 --> 08:13.993
I'm gonna offer you each a mirror.

08:16.579 --> 08:21.918
I want to invite you to spread your outer
labia open a little and see what's inside.

08:22.919 --> 08:26.339
Yeah. And just looking
with the recognition of, like,

08:26.422 --> 08:29.967
"Wow, this is a part of me
that makes magic."

08:30.801 --> 08:34.013
And just take some breath.
This is your experience.

08:34.555 --> 08:37.433
So many people are struggling
around their sexuality,

08:37.517 --> 08:39.435
their embodiment, their intimate life.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.438
It's because it has not
been widely modeled

08:42.522 --> 08:45.691
in the dominant
cultural paradigm we're inside of.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.695
Working as
a somatic sex and intimacy coach,

08:49.779 --> 08:54.784
we offer a space with
a lot of permission to be sexual

08:54.867 --> 08:59.539
and not have that be
a shameful, dirty, strange thing,

08:59.622 --> 09:03.209
and it is a pathway
for healing for people.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.796
In Sanskrit there is the word "yoni"

09:06.879 --> 09:11.759
that is used to speak about
the entirety of the female genitalia.

09:11.842 --> 09:14.262
We don't have
an equivalent word in English,

09:14.345 --> 09:19.183
and it's because that concept as a whole
doesn't even really exist anymore.

09:19.267 --> 09:23.354
Once upon a time that was treated with
a lot of reverence that we miss out on.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.606
But it doesn't mean
we can't make up for it.

09:25.690 --> 09:30.486
And so this is a sacred space
of meeting your yoni.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.989
In America in particular,

09:33.072 --> 09:37.243
generations past, women were in touch
with the rhythms of their body,

09:37.326 --> 09:40.371
had a connection
to the flow of the erotic.

09:40.454 --> 09:45.501
Colonizers came over and brought their
religious conditioning to the people,

09:45.585 --> 09:48.337
and to continue their primacy,

09:48.421 --> 09:49.839
they had to take away

09:49.922 --> 09:52.842
whatever power they perceived
as coming from the feminine.

09:52.925 --> 09:57.346
Anytime you've got a broad dogma
being overlaid, it says, like,

09:57.430 --> 09:59.932
"This is more important than you."

10:00.016 --> 10:03.769
And that is something felt in our bodies.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.273
What is coming up for you
as you look at yourself?

10:07.356 --> 10:08.691
As you see your vulva?

10:12.987 --> 10:16.032
I didn't realize what color she was.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.992
Tell me about her gorgeous color palette.

10:18.075 --> 10:24.373
Like, her colors go from light brown
and then kind of more into pink.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.167
How's it for you, Shandra?

10:26.917 --> 10:30.212
[sighs] I've never been
this up close and personal.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.922
[Darshana] What does she need to hear?

10:32.006 --> 10:33.049
Relax.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.216
[laughs] Yeah.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.470
-So, I'm gonna… So, intention, beautiful.
-Yeah.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.181
Impact…
We're gonna separate those two things.

10:40.264 --> 10:43.184
Like, your intention is, like,
"I want to be more relaxed."

10:43.267 --> 10:46.103
-But the impact of saying, "Relax!"
-[chuckles]

10:46.187 --> 10:47.396
-Think about that.
-Yeah.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.607
Right? I just tend to tense up.

10:51.817 --> 10:52.943
I don't know.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.529
She's been through it.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.492
I don't know, it's a lot.
I'm ready to learn, though.

10:59.575 --> 11:03.704
I'd like to offer the suggestion of, like,
"I'm committed to learning what you need

11:03.788 --> 11:06.248
in order to feel safe enough to relax."

11:06.332 --> 11:08.542
And that might be the dialogue.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.711
You wanna try that one out? Your version.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.422
I'm committed to learn more about you

11:14.256 --> 11:19.929
in order to relax
and be more intuitive with myself.

11:21.597 --> 11:25.309
And not be so, like, expecting the worst,

11:26.060 --> 11:28.562
or expecting pain all of a sudden.

11:28.646 --> 11:33.150
We're gonna go further into this
when we get to do our table work together.

11:34.235 --> 11:38.531
A big piece of the framework
that I offer to people

11:38.614 --> 11:40.574
is sexological bodywork.

11:40.658 --> 11:44.328
Given that penetration has been
problematic for Shandra,

11:44.412 --> 11:48.791
there can be a cathartic or breakthrough
type of moment in a session space.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.836
It's about sex,
but it's about so much more.

11:53.212 --> 11:57.174
-Oh, man. I'm just kidding. Yeah.
-Maybe you're not kidding.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.468
Maybe part of you
is really like, "Oh, shit."

11:59.552 --> 12:00.428
Oh, man. Yeah.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.931
What is sexological bodywork?

12:04.014 --> 12:06.225
It's a term that's specifically used

12:06.308 --> 12:10.271
when you do work
that actually involves the body

12:10.354 --> 12:15.901
as the body responds
to sexual touch and also the genitals.

12:15.985 --> 12:19.655
It's not legal everywhere
because it is hands-on.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.656
Hands-on?

12:20.740 --> 12:24.034
Like a therapist, hands on genital…

12:24.118 --> 12:24.952
Yes.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.287
It's legal in California?

12:26.370 --> 12:27.997
It is legal in California

12:28.080 --> 12:32.042
and very much used
in Europe also, therapeutically.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.462
-Right.
-For things like a birth trauma,

12:34.545 --> 12:36.589
or when there was a surgery,

12:36.672 --> 12:39.300
or physical violation
where there's a lot of pain.

12:39.383 --> 12:44.096
So a lot of those physical symptoms
can come from emotional, sexual trauma?

12:44.180 --> 12:46.474
Yes. It's not always emotional.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.685
Sometimes there's some
physical, underlying things,

12:49.769 --> 12:54.231
tight ligaments, lack of magnesium,
there's all kinds of stuff.

12:54.315 --> 12:59.445
So, one aspect focuses on giving the body
the support and the learning

12:59.528 --> 13:03.866
so the body can open up
without fear and shame and tension,

13:03.949 --> 13:08.078
and the other part focuses
on learning how to have pleasure.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.503
-[Jaiya] Lay on your back.
-Okay.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.589
Okay. And then
you're gonna get on the table.

13:18.672 --> 13:22.134
Okay, now, Erika,
put your legs over top of his legs.

13:23.677 --> 13:27.515
Yeah. And then just rest your legs.
Rest your legs anywhere that feels good.

13:27.598 --> 13:30.226
Okay, so now you're gonna put
one hand on her heart,

13:30.851 --> 13:33.729
and the other hand
on the top of her pubic bone,

13:33.813 --> 13:38.067
and then eventually you'll land
and just kind of ground her.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.362
What do you notice in your body?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.907
It's really difficult
not to get in my head.

13:45.574 --> 13:49.662
When Erika first got on the table,
I could feel her body tension,

13:49.745 --> 13:51.497
and of course you're gonna be nervous.

13:51.580 --> 13:56.126
There's cameras, she's just getting
to know me. So I want to check in,

13:56.210 --> 13:58.254
because as a sexological body worker,

13:58.337 --> 14:02.633
I'm looking at that whole picture
of the body, mind, spirit all together.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.010
What's happening in your head,
so we can presence it?

14:05.094 --> 14:07.596
I know this is the awful time
to relate it to that,

14:07.680 --> 14:09.682
but it's like
when you're having a pap smear.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.934
-And you stop breathing.
-'Cause you're bracing.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.896
-Yeah. That's exactly what I'm feeling.
-So your body has learned to brace.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.147
Mm-hmm.

14:17.231 --> 14:20.568
From pap smears,
from hard, from too fast, too hard.

14:20.651 --> 14:23.362
I never thought of that as bracing,
but yeah.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.572
[Jaiya] Yeah.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.574
Then tell me what body sensation you have.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.659
My thighs are kind of hurting.

14:28.742 --> 14:29.743
My feet are tense.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.745
You know how your feet go in the stirrups?

14:31.829 --> 14:34.540
-Feet tense, thighs clamping?
-Exactly what this feels like.

14:34.623 --> 14:35.916
-[chuckles]
-[Jaiya] Yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.211
Okay, now I want you to feel yourself
right here, right now,

14:39.295 --> 14:42.923
in this time, in this room.
Like, you're here. You're here now.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.510
I just released
a lot of tension in my legs.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.013
Yeah. When you felt yourself
here and now. Yeah.

14:49.513 --> 14:50.556
So you can let go now.

14:50.639 --> 14:53.976
Your body's not there anymore.
Your body's not in the past anymore.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.436
Mm.

14:56.645 --> 14:57.479
-[Jaiya] Good.
-Yeah.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.565
[Jaiya] What's coming up for you?

15:01.150 --> 15:04.904
I just realized
I've been bracing for a long time.

15:04.987 --> 15:05.821
Yeah.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.658
[Erika sobs]

15:11.785 --> 15:13.787
That's a lot to think about. Wow.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.998
-Can I put my hand on you?
-Yeah, of course.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.210
Okay, yeah.

15:22.379 --> 15:23.505
[sighs]

15:25.090 --> 15:28.510
[Jaiya] Your body's been in a little bit
of a freeze response for a while.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.553
Mmm.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.139
[exhales]

15:36.477 --> 15:39.939
This show
makes me cry all the time. [laughs]

15:40.022 --> 15:41.440
It's beautiful.

15:41.523 --> 15:42.566
[sighs]

15:42.650 --> 15:43.525
[Damon] Hi, baby.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.402
[Erika chuckles] Hi.

15:46.153 --> 15:49.823
[Damon] To see her have
that breakthrough, it was beautiful.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.325
I felt her,

15:52.660 --> 15:54.620
and learned more about her body.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.789
So, that was incredible.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.584
The emotional release
leads to the next level of arousal.

16:00.668 --> 16:01.669
Okay.

16:02.419 --> 16:05.798
[sensual music playing]

16:16.433 --> 16:20.896
A big part of what compounds our pain
is that we're afraid of it

16:20.980 --> 16:22.481
and we take it very seriously,

16:22.564 --> 16:26.485
and our body protects us
in that way very naturally.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.821
It's like, "Okay, ah, um, armor."

16:28.904 --> 16:31.949
"I know this isn't gonna be good,
I'm gonna brace myself for it."

16:40.457 --> 16:46.213
The premise of what we're gonna explore
is both an energetic and a physical style.

16:46.296 --> 16:50.634
And we're gonna meet those places
where the armor tends to lock in

16:51.260 --> 16:53.262
with more compassion.

16:53.846 --> 16:57.766
Shandra grew up in
a very conservative, religious environment

16:57.850 --> 17:00.978
where sexuality unto itself
was not included,

17:01.061 --> 17:04.314
and lesbianism certainly was not condoned.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.567
That shows up in a lot of people's bodies.

17:06.650 --> 17:10.237
This kind of generalized pain

17:10.320 --> 17:15.659
is not necessarily because there's
a physical brokenness, problem or injury.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.454
Oftentimes, it's a physical response

17:18.537 --> 17:21.290
to the emotional
and psychological imprinting.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.207
It's the shame.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.917
The shame freezes our bodies,

17:24.001 --> 17:26.879
it locks our bodies,
it is a protective measure,

17:26.962 --> 17:32.968
and that is a prime example
of how our trauma imprints can live.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.179
-And look, you're already having feelings.
-Huh?

17:35.262 --> 17:37.347
-Tell me, what are you feeling?
-Oh, God.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.809
I'm a little nervous 'cause
I've obviously never done this before.

17:40.893 --> 17:41.894
[Darshana] Yeah.

17:41.977 --> 17:42.811
[sighs]

17:42.895 --> 17:44.897
It's been a problem for a while, so…

17:44.980 --> 17:45.939
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.067
You're gonna know
what I'm doing every step of the way

17:48.150 --> 17:50.152
'cause I'm gonna tell you
before I do anything,

17:50.235 --> 17:54.114
and I'm gonna check in and see
if you're really on board for it or not.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.533
Because if you're not,
what's gonna happen?

17:57.284 --> 17:58.702
-I'm going to tense up.
-[both] No.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.496
-[Shandra] No? Sorry.
-We're not gonna do it.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.790
-We're not gonna do it.
-That's the one rule.

18:02.873 --> 18:06.418
That's the one rule. Is that
if you don't want it, it doesn't happen.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.336
Got it.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.255
And if we move toward penetrative touch,

18:10.339 --> 18:13.092
every step of the way
I'm gonna be in conversation with you,

18:13.175 --> 18:15.511
and it's gonna be
very gentle and very slow.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.763
-And none of it has to happen.
-Got it.

18:17.846 --> 18:22.601
Sexological bodywork
is a modality that actually arose

18:22.684 --> 18:28.524
as a response to the AIDS and HIV crisis
in the gay male communities

18:28.607 --> 18:31.360
to provide a service

18:31.443 --> 18:36.156
that sits at the intersection of eroticism
and trauma healing modalities.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.117
But now, it's all genders.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.327
I'm gonna start on your pubic mound.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.578
-Got it.
-Okay.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.081
Feel the presence of my hand.

18:44.665 --> 18:45.707
It's so warm.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.502
So warm.
What are the associations of warm?

18:48.585 --> 18:50.003
I would say comfort.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.463
I guess, safety.

18:52.005 --> 18:53.215
[Darshana] Mmm.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.716
So, just let that in.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.971
And you have full permission

19:00.139 --> 19:01.140
to receive it.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.976
A big part of being
a sexological bodyworker

19:04.059 --> 19:06.395
is that I provide genital contact.

19:06.478 --> 19:11.733
So, the next progression then would be
for your thighs to spread open a little.

19:11.817 --> 19:15.112
My fingers are gonna drop down
over your vulva, if you're okay with that.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.321
[Shandra] Yeah.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.198
[Darshana]
I'm wearing gloves at all times.

19:18.282 --> 19:22.202
The touch is one-directional,
it is fully consensual,

19:22.286 --> 19:26.999
and it's empowered consent that
the client would be educated in beforehand

19:27.082 --> 19:30.502
so that they are empowered
to advocate for themselves.

19:30.586 --> 19:35.257
And I am vigilantly, like, making sure
that they're doing exactly that.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.176
How's your yoni?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.387
She's good so far.

19:40.470 --> 19:41.305
[Darshana] Yeah?

19:41.889 --> 19:45.058
Is there a desire
to explore a little further?

19:45.601 --> 19:46.810
You tell me.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.604
We can explore a little further.

19:48.687 --> 19:49.605
[Darshana] Okay.

19:49.688 --> 19:50.689
I'm okay.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.446
-That's brave.
-[Michaela] Yeah.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.947
I mean, that's really brave.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.407
Would you do that?

20:01.950 --> 20:04.453
-Yeah, I think I might do that.
-Yeah.

20:04.536 --> 20:05.495
I think I might.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.956
-I have a--
-It would be really hard for me.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.627
It's one thing to be
emotionally vulnerable on camera,

20:11.710 --> 20:14.171
but to be sexually vulnerable
like that as well,

20:14.254 --> 20:17.299
it's kind of herculean. It's very cool.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.386
[Jaiya] Okay, so now
we're gonna start with the outer labia

20:21.470 --> 20:23.472
and just go up like that.

20:24.514 --> 20:25.432
Oh.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.393
[moans softly]

20:28.477 --> 20:31.271
[Jaiya] Yes, and you don't even
have to do much. See how she's moving?

20:31.355 --> 20:33.815
You could just barely touch
and let her move

20:33.899 --> 20:37.611
so that she's now rocking on your fingers.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.410
-[Erika moans softly]
-Okay. I'm gonna have you take 2 fingers.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.288
You're gonna put them
on the external labia.

20:48.372 --> 20:51.083
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna expose the clitoris.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.503
-[Erika] Oh.
-[Jaiya] Okay. So, see how she wings?

20:54.586 --> 20:59.841
Your inner labia wing at your introitus,
like little butterfly wings.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.971
So you have
these beautiful butterfly wings

21:04.054 --> 21:06.306
right at the opening
of your vaginal canal.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.307
[Erika] Mm.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.935
It's gorgeous. It looks so inviting.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.729
[Jaiya] And then do you feel
as you're stroking up,

21:12.813 --> 21:14.898
where the head of her clitoris is?

21:16.400 --> 21:18.819
It'll feel like a little nut--
Like, a hard little ball.

21:18.902 --> 21:19.903
-Yes.
-[Erika] I felt that.

21:19.987 --> 21:20.821
There. Yeah.

21:20.904 --> 21:24.199
Just press on it and hold in stillness.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.868
Can you feel it
kind of moving or vibrating or…

21:28.578 --> 21:31.248
-[Damon] Yeah.
-Yeah. Your clitoris is very alive.

21:31.331 --> 21:35.294
-She was tucked in underneath the sheath.
-[chuckles] Okay.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.881
-You have a lot of clitoral hood.
-[Erika] Okay.

21:39.965 --> 21:43.093
Remember how I said some people
are outies and some are innies?

21:43.176 --> 21:44.594
You have a lot of clitoral hood.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.973
-Okay.
-So it's just covering your clitoris.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.811
I feel like this was
really life-altering, like,

21:52.894 --> 21:56.315
now knowing that I have more,
like, hood over my clitoris,

21:56.398 --> 22:00.277
and that it's normal,
I feel a sense of empowerment.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.989
[Jaiya] You're gonna take
your thumb and your forefinger,

22:04.072 --> 22:06.908
and you're gonna grab
the shaft of her clitoris

22:06.992 --> 22:08.660
between the thumb and forefinger.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.538
Beautiful, Damon.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.123
And then you move.

22:13.206 --> 22:15.917
So, you're just gonna hold the shaft,
and she's gonna move,

22:16.001 --> 22:19.129
which is gonna rock
the head and the shaft of the clitoris.

22:19.212 --> 22:22.424
So she gets to kind of control her motion.

22:24.009 --> 22:28.430
I find this, like, really nice,
like, it's so soft.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.475
It's opposite of what we're used to doing.

22:31.558 --> 22:34.269
It's a lot harder,
and I think when I start liking it,

22:34.353 --> 22:36.021
he starts pressing harder.

22:36.104 --> 22:37.856
Uh-huh.
The more aroused you get, the harder…

22:37.939 --> 22:40.359
-Because that's how it's taught.
-I actually like it softer.

22:40.442 --> 22:43.945
It's like, "Oh, she's getting
more aroused. Rub faster and go harder."

22:44.029 --> 22:47.741
And with you,
because you're energetic, it's spacious.

22:47.824 --> 22:50.494
-It's like, give it breath.
-Mm-hmm.

22:50.577 --> 22:53.914
Just even in
that little bit of time, like,

22:53.997 --> 22:58.668
it made such a difference
in the way Damon was handling

22:58.752 --> 23:00.754
those parts of my body.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.173
Know how you said you didn't know
what to do when on top?

23:03.256 --> 23:04.257
This.

23:05.592 --> 23:09.638
-He's inside of you, and you move.
-[Erika] Oh, I see.

23:09.721 --> 23:13.725
And then you find where your clitoris
makes contact with his pubic bone,

23:13.809 --> 23:16.353
and then you ride right on his pubic bone.

23:16.436 --> 23:17.521
-Wow.
-[Jaiya laughs]

23:17.604 --> 23:18.605
Nice. [chuckles]

23:19.648 --> 23:22.234
Oh, that was hot. [laughs]

23:24.027 --> 23:29.699
[Erika] I think Damon was also very
surprised at how much he enjoyed this,

23:29.783 --> 23:32.494
and I'm sure he's still
sitting there thinking,

23:32.577 --> 23:35.414
"Oh, my God.
Here I am thinking she's always so, like,

23:36.206 --> 23:37.040
uptight."

23:37.124 --> 23:38.125
[chuckles]

23:38.959 --> 23:40.252
I'm not that uptight.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.217
-I love you, honey.
-I love you too.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.927
-[Jaiya] Do you want to get dressed?
-Okay.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.637
[Jaiya] We'll move to our next adventure.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.681
-[Erika] Sounds good.
-[Jaiya chuckles]

23:58.270 --> 24:02.232
[Darshana] So, moving on,
I'm going to stroke your labia.

24:02.315 --> 24:03.150
Okay.

24:03.233 --> 24:07.362
I'm gonna come up
with the underside of my fingers.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.489
[exhales]

24:09.573 --> 24:10.407
[Darshana] Yeah.

24:11.158 --> 24:12.159
How's that touch?

24:13.493 --> 24:14.619
-It's good.
-Yeah?

24:15.412 --> 24:20.917
How would you feel about me placing
my finger at the entrance of your vagina?

24:21.001 --> 24:21.835
-Yeah.
-Okay.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.128
It's… It's fine.

24:23.211 --> 24:25.922
I'm starting to feel a little bit of pain.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.507
So, I'm gonna lighten my touch.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.759
-That actually helped.
-Great.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.136
-Yeah.
-Okay.

24:31.219 --> 24:35.015
I think I'm ready to go in further.

24:35.682 --> 24:36.766
-Yeah.
-Okay.

24:36.850 --> 24:40.270
So, I'm gonna do that really slowly,
and you're gonna breathe while I do it.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.606
-Okay.
-Okay? Let's breathe together.

24:42.689 --> 24:45.275
[both breathing deeply]

24:47.319 --> 24:48.278
And how's that?

24:49.946 --> 24:50.822
Fine.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.742
You're receiving
penetrative touch right now,

24:53.825 --> 24:55.368
and you're staying present for it.

24:55.452 --> 24:56.995
That's a beautiful thing.

25:00.415 --> 25:02.417
[both exhaling]

25:02.501 --> 25:04.169
Let's get the breath down deeper.

25:04.252 --> 25:05.587
Down here.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.968
Are you able to sense
my finger inside of you?

25:12.636 --> 25:13.553
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

25:13.637 --> 25:15.764
What…
what do you notice in that sensing?

25:15.847 --> 25:19.267
I'm just really relaxed,
which doesn't happen that often.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.185
Mm.

25:20.268 --> 25:23.396
And I don't feel any pain, which is crazy.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.734
-It's happening.
-[laughs]

25:29.069 --> 25:31.905
[Darshana] Aw, yeah, there's your love,

25:31.988 --> 25:35.909
and here's your body
feeling safe enough to receive.

25:36.910 --> 25:38.203
-Yeah.
-[sighs]

25:38.703 --> 25:39.538
Yeah.

25:41.122 --> 25:41.998
Mm.

25:44.751 --> 25:49.631
Anybody that knows Shandra just, like,
knows she just isn't as open as I am.

25:49.714 --> 25:55.387
Even saying the word "sex" at one point
in her life was extremely not accepted.

25:55.470 --> 25:59.057
So I was very proud of her
to be willing to jump into that.

25:59.140 --> 26:03.228
And now, up here,
this is your urethral sponge,

26:03.311 --> 26:06.147
which is commonly
referred to as the G-spot.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.692
[exhales]

26:09.442 --> 26:10.527
Yeah.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.824
[both exhale]

26:18.577 --> 26:19.744
Tell me what you feel.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.998
I don't know how to explain it.
It's just… It's amazing.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.917
[Darshana] Okay, yeah, amazing.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.377
-Yeah.
-I love it.

26:27.460 --> 26:30.005
I felt great.
I don't… It's hard to explain.

26:30.964 --> 26:35.552
I was just focusing on myself and just
enjoying where I'm at in that moment,

26:35.635 --> 26:37.012
and it worked.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.513
[laughs] It's crazy.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.223
I'm taking notes.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.058
-So was I.
-[all laugh]

26:42.142 --> 26:45.770
I have a partner that supports that
and supports, like, communication,

26:45.854 --> 26:48.773
and that's what today kind of taught me.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.025
-Go, team.
-Go, team.

26:50.108 --> 26:50.984
[laughs]

26:51.067 --> 26:55.989
[Shandra] It is a lot to kind of
expose yourself on camera,

26:56.072 --> 26:58.033
but it was amazing.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.995
You're paving the way
for many, many women out there.

27:02.078 --> 27:04.956
Yeah. That's kind of
what we keep telling ourselves.

27:05.040 --> 27:09.544
I've sat with many, many parents
who were where your mother was.

27:09.628 --> 27:13.006
I can tell you
that there's no shortage of love.

27:13.089 --> 27:17.344
When you are indoctrinated
in a certain way, you believe so strongly

27:17.427 --> 27:19.971
that you have to protect
your children against that.

27:20.055 --> 27:24.059
I can tell you, though,
often later in life, it gets resolved.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.728
-[Shandra] Yeah.
-By you being happy.

27:28.396 --> 27:30.190
-Don't do it, 'cause I'll do it.
-Sorry.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.150
[laughing]

27:32.233 --> 27:34.861
[Michaela] And if it doesn't,
then at least you're happy.

27:34.944 --> 27:36.404
-It's okay. Yeah.
-[all laugh]

27:36.488 --> 27:38.073
-Exactly.
-At least we're happy.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.074
Yes.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.576
[gentle piano music playing]

27:43.787 --> 27:45.997
-Okay.
-I think you should relax your body.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.457
Oh, it's so warm.

27:47.540 --> 27:48.792
[Darshana] Yeah.

27:49.668 --> 27:50.627
You're next.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.755
-I'm ready.
-[Darshana] Okay.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.049
Am I nervous? Yes.

27:56.132 --> 27:58.009
Am I scared? More so.

27:58.093 --> 28:02.722
But I can't help but think
that this is a bravery thing. So…

28:02.806 --> 28:06.768
Um, that's just what we've been telling
each other throughout this whole thing.

28:07.268 --> 28:10.480
[gentle piano music continues]
