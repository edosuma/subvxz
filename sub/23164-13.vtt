WEBVTT

01:22.234 --> 01:25.239
Company A. Ten-hut!

01:27.274 --> 01:30.648
Company, forward, march!

03:27.284 --> 03:29.087
Surprise!

03:29.153 --> 03:31.758
One, two, three...

03:31.823 --> 03:34.261
Happy birthday, Thomas!

03:34.359 --> 03:35.628
Yeah!

03:37.263 --> 03:39.801
No, now you promised!
I didn't promise.

03:39.866 --> 03:43.206
I said I wouldn't throw you
a surprise birthday party.

03:43.270 --> 03:46.777
Yes, but she didn't say anything about my
throwing you a surprise birthday party!

03:48.543 --> 03:49.913
Don Eddie.

03:51.647 --> 03:52.916
I was gonna call you.

03:52.982 --> 03:55.454
Oh, yeah. Sure. You know, this
guy's been in town four days.

03:55.518 --> 03:57.638
The only way I get to see him
is to throw him a party.

03:59.122 --> 04:02.562
I'm a year older, as you've all
so thoughtfully reminded me.

04:04.029 --> 04:05.699
Thanks, everybody.

04:06.264 --> 04:07.666
I'm really surprised.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.540
Well, we might as well go and
finish what's left of the food.

04:11.604 --> 04:13.140
Yeah! That way.

04:15.042 --> 04:17.414
Hey, Thomas, happy birthday.
Hi, thanks.

04:17.478 --> 04:19.014
Hey, Thomas, meet my son, Doug.

04:19.079 --> 04:20.147
Thanks, Bill. Hi, Doug.

04:20.214 --> 04:21.584
How are you?

04:21.649 --> 04:23.586
Thank you.
Thanks, nice to see you.

04:24.219 --> 04:25.254
Nice to have you home.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.224
You guys... Thanks, thanks.

04:27.289 --> 04:29.359
Honestly, Thomas,
where have you been?

04:29.425 --> 04:32.331
You said you'd be back
by 6:30, it's nearly 11:OO.

04:32.396 --> 04:34.566
No kidding. I didn't
know it was that late.

04:34.632 --> 04:36.234
Where's Billy? In bed.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.604
Here, have some of this.
I call it Karen's Cooler.

04:38.669 --> 04:41.409
No, Karen, I'm gonna get
a beer in the refrigerator.

05:14.446 --> 05:16.049
OO.

05:16.115 --> 05:19.455
Said that he was sorry he couldn't
get back for the celebration.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.390
Isn't he getting
a little old to be flying.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.132
That's good.

05:32.968 --> 05:35.173
Tom... Okay, Katherine,
you've gotta let him go.

05:35.237 --> 05:36.707
His guests are getting restless.

05:37.006 --> 05:38.376
Is there any more dip?

05:38.441 --> 05:40.044
In the fridge. Well

05:40.110 --> 05:42.113
I think this is the big weekend.

05:42.179 --> 05:43.814
Oh, yeah? For what?

05:45.083 --> 05:46.619
Me and Don Eddie...

05:46.685 --> 05:48.021
You know. No. What?

05:48.120 --> 05:51.259
I think he's getting ready
to ask for a certain

05:51.323 --> 05:54.129
incredibly wonderful woman's
hand in marriage.

05:54.193 --> 05:56.831
No kidding. I thought
he was dating you.

05:59.133 --> 06:00.703
Don't say anything to him.

06:00.768 --> 06:01.903
Okay.

06:04.539 --> 06:06.977
What time are you going
to the reunion tomorrow?

06:07.176 --> 06:09.080
I've decided not to go.

06:11.982 --> 06:13.385
I stopped by Annapolis today.

06:13.617 --> 06:16.255
Stopped by? That's some drive.

06:17.889 --> 06:20.427
Did you throw a penny on...

06:20.792 --> 06:22.395
What's his name? Tecumseh.

06:23.529 --> 06:25.466
In his quiver for good luck?

06:25.531 --> 06:27.969
Yeah.
That's reunion enough for me.

06:31.839 --> 06:33.609
I better get back.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.344
You might as well
talk about it now

06:35.409 --> 06:37.247
or you'll just have to
talk about it tomorrow.

06:37.312 --> 06:38.480
What?

06:38.547 --> 06:41.921
Whatever it is you don't
wanna be talking about.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.189
What makes you think I'm not
talking about something?

06:44.253 --> 06:47.393
You said you wanted to come
home to go to your reunion.

06:47.457 --> 06:48.458
I changed my mind.

06:48.525 --> 06:51.097
Well, you said there were things
you wanted to talk about.

06:51.162 --> 06:53.100
Yeah, not maior things. Just...

06:53.165 --> 06:55.737
And you're drinking beer
like you own the company.

06:55.801 --> 06:59.175
Well it's my birthday after
all, and I'm on vacation.

07:05.179 --> 07:08.386
I have been thinking
of making some changes.

07:15.457 --> 07:16.960
You remember Maggie Poole?

07:19.830 --> 07:25.041
I used to work with her
at Naval Intelligence.

07:26.871 --> 07:29.076
She brought me this letter.

07:31.777 --> 07:33.045
It's from Michelle.

07:38.152 --> 07:39.788
You can read it.

07:41.623 --> 07:42.925
I know.

07:53.069 --> 07:54.338
Michelle

07:55.740 --> 07:57.844
wanted me to know that Lily

07:59.277 --> 08:00.813
is my daughter.

08:06.719 --> 08:09.157
In case something
happened to her.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.401
I have this feeling.

08:21.937 --> 08:23.974
You know me and my hunches.

08:25.342 --> 08:27.747
I've been
writing letters to Lily.

08:28.545 --> 08:29.881
Still...

08:32.984 --> 08:35.289
I just can't believe she's dead.

08:38.023 --> 08:41.230
That's the first time
I've said the word out loud.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.970
After your father died,

08:48.569 --> 08:52.143
I used to go into his
closet and close the door.

08:52.375 --> 08:54.010
It was cool and dark,

08:55.677 --> 08:58.450
his scent
still clung to the clothes.

09:00.384 --> 09:02.922
That's where I did
most of my crying,

09:03.288 --> 09:04.657
and later,

09:05.090 --> 09:06.760
my talking to him,

09:10.763 --> 09:14.938
sitting on the floor in all that
blackness, pretending he was there,

09:16.369 --> 09:17.739
listening.

09:20.141 --> 09:23.982
I've run out of excuses, Tom.
You'd better get out here!

09:38.763 --> 09:40.643
Good night, Karen. Thank you.
Good night, Devon.

09:40.664 --> 09:43.036
Good night, Rosemary.
Good night, Karen.

09:43.101 --> 09:44.471
All right,

09:44.870 --> 09:45.973
what's the story?

09:46.038 --> 09:47.173
About what?

09:47.540 --> 09:50.012
You lay this
bomb on me that my friend

09:50.077 --> 09:52.214
is maybe gonna ask you
to marry him,

09:52.279 --> 09:54.083
and then there's no story
that goes along with that?

09:54.149 --> 09:55.184
Oh, that.

09:55.250 --> 09:57.788
Oh! You better get that.
I think it's for you.

09:57.852 --> 09:59.622
Something your mother cooked up.

09:59.687 --> 10:00.956
No.

10:01.023 --> 10:02.225
This is not a singing telegram.

10:02.291 --> 10:03.961
Thomas...
l hate singing telegrams!

10:04.026 --> 10:06.665
Answer the door. Go.
They're embarrassing.

10:06.730 --> 10:07.898
And not just for me,

10:07.964 --> 10:10.536
for the poor girl who has to
parade around in those

10:10.600 --> 10:11.836
skimpy, little outfits.

10:12.970 --> 10:14.540
Hi. Good evening.

10:14.605 --> 10:17.043
I'm looking
for Katherine Peterson.

10:17.142 --> 10:18.210
Oh!

10:18.278 --> 10:20.582
You made it! I'm sorry I'm late.

10:20.847 --> 10:21.982
Tom.

10:22.749 --> 10:24.185
Captain Thomas Magnum,

10:24.517 --> 10:28.124
I'd like you to meet Lieutenant
Commander, Thomas Magnum,

10:28.789 --> 10:30.325
your grandson.

10:38.634 --> 10:41.072
Sounds like the kind ofiam
you're always in, Thomas.

10:41.138 --> 10:43.175
Well, sir, there I was,

10:43.240 --> 10:46.982
broke and in Louisville mere
days before the Kentucky Derby.

10:48.246 --> 10:49.315
What'd you do?

10:49.381 --> 10:50.649
Well, what else could I do?

10:50.715 --> 10:54.156
I sought out the owner
of the odds-on favorite.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.258
I bet the man $10,OOO

10:56.323 --> 10:58.928
that I could outrun his
thoroughbred in a 100-yard dash.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.197
You, on foot,

11:02.497 --> 11:03.632
racing a horse?

11:03.698 --> 11:04.833
Yes.

11:05.434 --> 11:06.970
After I won,
I took the money and...

11:07.035 --> 11:08.471
Whoa... You won?

11:09.339 --> 11:12.713
Well, there's no point in
racing if you're not gonna win.

11:12.775 --> 11:13.943
Uh-huh.

11:15.145 --> 11:16.848
How'd you do that?

11:17.047 --> 11:18.917
I agreed to race
at his breeding farm

11:18.983 --> 11:22.591
if he gave me the right
to pick the exact course.

11:22.954 --> 11:26.027
You lay out a course
that's fifty yards long,

11:26.092 --> 11:28.630
and by the time the iockey
gets the horse turned around,

11:29.061 --> 11:30.297
you're home free.

11:30.364 --> 11:31.632
Exactly.

11:31.999 --> 11:33.067
How'd you think of that?

11:33.133 --> 11:34.636
That's what I would've done.

11:34.701 --> 11:36.705
Why'd you leave the Navy?

11:36.871 --> 11:40.578
Sadly, I lost over half my
winnings the next night

11:41.043 --> 11:42.613
on an unfortunate investment.

11:42.678 --> 11:44.381
You had your own ship.

11:44.447 --> 11:46.450
That's a lot to give up.

11:47.585 --> 11:48.620
Well, it's a...

11:48.685 --> 11:51.323
it's a bit of a drive
back to my hotel.

11:51.389 --> 11:52.892
I thought you were
gonna be staying here.

11:52.957 --> 11:54.560
Katherine mentioned
that you might be...

11:54.625 --> 11:56.495
Well, it was
gracious of her to offer,

11:56.561 --> 11:59.935
but I've got my BOQ
setup already.

12:00.066 --> 12:02.437
I'd really like to talk to you.

12:02.502 --> 12:04.473
You know there's nothing
I'd like better than to

12:04.771 --> 12:07.443
sit around the old
cracker barrel,

12:08.008 --> 12:09.444
but right now...

12:09.611 --> 12:12.149
Well, I'll walk you out to the car.
Fine.

12:13.148 --> 12:16.890
- Marvelous party.
- Oh, I had a lot of help.

12:18.054 --> 12:19.590
Good night, all.

13:09.749 --> 13:11.552
Hey, where are you going?

13:12.786 --> 13:14.823
Thomas, what're you doing?

13:15.356 --> 13:16.658
Hey, Thomas!

13:16.723 --> 13:18.594
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:19.927 --> 13:22.065
Hey, it's a long walk home.

13:24.133 --> 13:25.402
I didn't hear you.

13:27.203 --> 13:29.206
Place always gets to me.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.545
Must have been here
20 times over the years.

13:33.144 --> 13:34.947
It always gets to me.

13:36.014 --> 13:37.149
You okay?

13:37.717 --> 13:38.852
Great.

13:39.719 --> 13:40.720
Except...

13:42.021 --> 13:45.093
Except nothing. Come on,
we've got a lot to see.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.796
So, what's the story
with you and Karen?

13:47.861 --> 13:49.029
Oh, great. Right.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.067
You clam up and then you expect
me to spill my guts about

13:51.132 --> 13:52.567
everything that's going on
in my personal life.

13:52.634 --> 13:53.636
Not everything. Good.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.572
Just about my cousin.
Just about Karen.

13:55.638 --> 13:56.874
So, what's the story?

13:56.939 --> 14:01.481
I don't know. I'm thinking
of asking her to marry me.

14:02.112 --> 14:03.147
Boy,

14:03.714 --> 14:04.782
what's all this wedding stuff?

14:04.848 --> 14:07.320
You know, I don't know. The only thing
is the logistics and everything.

14:07.385 --> 14:09.389
I mean, you know...
First Rick, now you.

14:09.455 --> 14:11.258
Here I am,
I'm living in Pinehurst

14:11.323 --> 14:13.093
and working in D.C. It must
be something in the air.

14:13.158 --> 14:14.318
She's over there in Tidewater,

14:14.326 --> 14:16.246
her boy's all settled
in school and everything...

14:16.262 --> 14:17.364
Kind of like the Asian flu.
I just...

14:17.430 --> 14:18.833
You have the flu?

14:18.898 --> 14:22.272
No. We're talking about you
getting married.

14:22.336 --> 14:23.438
You know, you're right.

14:23.504 --> 14:26.310
I should stop driving myself
crazy with the small stuff.

14:26.374 --> 14:27.810
I should ask her
to marry me first.

14:27.876 --> 14:31.350
If she says yes, then I
worry about the details.

14:32.348 --> 14:33.416
Thanks, Thomas.

14:33.483 --> 14:36.289
I knew talking to you
would help me out.

14:40.008 --> 14:42.113
I'll have an Old Düsseldorf
in a long neck.

14:42.177 --> 14:44.347
I'm sorry, this party
is for military only.

14:44.413 --> 14:46.618
That's okay, I used to be one.

14:48.184 --> 14:49.185
Hi.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.658
Now is it my imagination or
you've been ducking out on me?

14:52.723 --> 14:54.426
There's lot of people
to catch up with.

14:54.492 --> 14:55.761
You give any thought
to what I said?

14:55.827 --> 14:57.864
Look, Bryce, I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

14:58.296 --> 14:59.431
I'm not trying to do it for you.

14:59.498 --> 15:00.778
I'm trying to do it
for the Navy.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.539
Man, with your background,
your abilities...

15:03.770 --> 15:05.440
I mean, hell, man.
I am a captain.

15:05.506 --> 15:08.011
With your skills, you'd
have your own ship by now.

15:08.076 --> 15:09.445
I'm telling you,

15:09.510 --> 15:11.915
I can do whatever it takes
to get you back in.

15:11.980 --> 15:14.385
No. Thanks.

15:14.516 --> 15:15.916
Well, at least give it
some thought.

15:15.951 --> 15:17.654
I put that behind me
for good, Bryce.

15:17.720 --> 15:20.526
That part of my life is over.
Look, I've got an appointment.

15:21.191 --> 15:22.327
It's good to see you again.

15:22.392 --> 15:23.627
Good to see you.

15:29.034 --> 15:31.606
So, how is it you're all
dressed up with nowhere to go?

15:31.670 --> 15:34.743
Oh, I think right here is
as good a place to go as any.

15:34.807 --> 15:37.044
Well, you know, if you're gonna
eat, you should grab a table.

15:37.111 --> 15:39.281
Kitchen's gonna close
in about ten minutes.

15:39.345 --> 15:42.251
Well, that gives me about nine
minutes to think about it.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.685
I will have
another beer, though.

15:43.751 --> 15:44.887
Okay.

15:45.620 --> 15:47.824
Telephone message
for Mr. Magnum.

15:47.889 --> 15:49.660
Oh, I'm Thomas Magnum.

15:49.725 --> 15:52.263
You're Thomas Magnum?
I'm a little confused.

15:52.328 --> 15:54.598
I thought the telephone message
was from a Thomas Magnum.

15:54.665 --> 15:56.034
Oh, that's my grandfather.

15:56.099 --> 15:58.270
He's expecting me. Oh, I see.

16:01.940 --> 16:03.643
Sandy. Yeah?

16:04.375 --> 16:05.878
What's that word?

16:05.945 --> 16:07.013
"Sorry."

16:07.446 --> 16:10.118
What's the rest of it say?
The lights are...

16:10.183 --> 16:14.058
"I'm afraid I can't make it after all.
Sorry. Captain Magnum."

16:17.625 --> 16:20.932
Can you cancel the beer?
I'll have a scotch instead.

16:24.701 --> 16:26.905
I love you, Michelle,

16:29.305 --> 16:31.643
more than anyone
I've ever known,

16:32.776 --> 16:34.680
and I'm letting you go.

16:36.448 --> 16:37.783
Dear Thomas,

16:37.983 --> 16:41.223
as I wríte thís letter, I pray to
god that you wíll never read ít.

16:41.787 --> 16:44.025
For íf you do, ít means that
somethíng has happened

16:44.091 --> 16:46.463
to separate me
from Líly forever.

16:46.827 --> 16:51.637
But íf that should happen, ít ís ímperatíve
that she be reuníted wíth her father.

16:51.699 --> 16:53.736
You are that man, Thomas.

16:53.801 --> 16:55.739
I thínk you
always knew you were.

16:56.171 --> 16:58.743
Please take care of her
and of you.

16:59.375 --> 17:01.913
I always loved you, Míchelle.

17:15.560 --> 17:16.762
Billy.

17:17.730 --> 17:21.304
Mom said I couldn't wake you up.
I told her I'd just wait.

17:22.469 --> 17:25.107
Uh-huh. I see. Good. Thank you.

17:26.407 --> 17:27.643
You feel okay?

17:32.648 --> 17:33.951
I'm fine.

17:34.650 --> 17:35.919
Guess what.

17:35.986 --> 17:39.193
Don Eddie asked my mom to marry him.
She said yes,

17:39.323 --> 17:42.997
and we're gonna move into this new
house together. Isn't that cool?

17:43.062 --> 17:44.597
That's great.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.538
Teenage Mutant Nínja Turtles?

17:49.601 --> 17:51.706
I left that for you just in
case you wanted to read it

17:51.771 --> 17:53.074
when you got home last night.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.642
Oh. Uh-huh.

17:55.209 --> 17:57.380
I didn't feel like reading.

17:57.445 --> 17:59.515
He woke up all by himself.

17:59.613 --> 18:01.149
Thanks.

18:04.686 --> 18:07.526
Do you want a cup of coffee?

18:10.861 --> 18:13.433
How was your dinner
with the Captain?

18:13.497 --> 18:15.635
Oh, about what you'd expect.

18:15.967 --> 18:17.670
He didn't show up.

18:18.670 --> 18:20.741
Do you want some breakfast?

18:21.474 --> 18:23.244
Here's your Turtles.

18:28.416 --> 18:32.291
Do you think being a private investigator
is just an excuse not to grow up?

18:32.354 --> 18:33.656
No. Not really.

18:33.888 --> 18:34.890
No way!

18:37.226 --> 18:38.829
Hello.

18:39.095 --> 18:42.134
Oh, I'm so surprised
to hear from you.

18:42.899 --> 18:45.972
Oh, are you in for Mr. Higgins?

18:51.643 --> 18:55.918
Oh, I suppose congratulations
are in order.

19:00.387 --> 19:03.059
I assume this is
real important, Higgins.

19:03.123 --> 19:04.659
Magnum,
I'm terribly sorry, but...

19:04.725 --> 19:06.328
I think this configuration

19:06.394 --> 19:07.897
is absolutely... Excuse me.

19:07.962 --> 19:09.765
I'm sorry to interrupt your vacation...
I'll be outside.

19:09.832 --> 19:12.337
But I've just received
a call from Linda Lee Ellison.

19:12.535 --> 19:15.407
She's a television reporter you
dated last year for a short time.

19:15.472 --> 19:17.209
Higgins, I know who I dated.

19:17.274 --> 19:19.980
Then perhaps you also know
that she's in the hospital.

19:20.044 --> 19:22.114
Someone tríed to kíll her.

20:41.742 --> 20:43.979
Hey, Thomas.

20:44.044 --> 20:45.815
Oh, geez. I'm sorry.

20:46.314 --> 20:47.850
Take your time.

20:59.196 --> 21:00.398
Thomas.

21:02.099 --> 21:03.836
What are you doing?

21:04.735 --> 21:05.904
You came back?

21:05.971 --> 21:07.941
Well, when somebody
tries to kill somebody,

21:08.006 --> 21:11.246
I just automatically jump
on a plane and come home.

21:12.412 --> 21:14.750
It's kind of
a bad habit of mine.

21:15.748 --> 21:17.051
Besides, you're here
for observation.

21:17.117 --> 21:19.155
I thought I'd just observe.

21:21.923 --> 21:25.230
Well, I hope I didn't get you
here under false pretenses.

21:25.294 --> 21:26.964
What do you mean?

21:30.033 --> 21:32.838
I've been working on a tough
story about organized crime

21:32.903 --> 21:34.406
in the Islands.

21:34.838 --> 21:36.107
I've been tired

21:36.174 --> 21:40.349
and a little nervous about some of
the people I've been interviewing.

21:40.479 --> 21:42.717
So, I guess my own paranoia
made me suspect

21:42.781 --> 21:44.986
that someone was following me.

21:46.319 --> 21:47.889
But no one was.

21:50.391 --> 21:52.228
I'm so embarrassed.

21:53.295 --> 21:55.800
The police found
absolutely nothing.

21:56.798 --> 21:59.403
Now I know
I have a vivid imagination,

21:59.469 --> 22:01.841
but I didn't realize
it could go that far.

22:09.681 --> 22:12.721
I've also been thinking
a lot about you lately.

22:13.752 --> 22:15.555
And when this happened, well,

22:16.722 --> 22:19.727
it just seemed like
a good excuse to call you.

22:24.198 --> 22:25.533
I've missed you.

22:28.936 --> 22:31.174
I can't believe you came back.

22:32.841 --> 22:34.644
But I'm glad you did.

22:38.882 --> 22:40.151
So am I.

22:43.187 --> 22:45.091
You remember The Three
Musketeers, right? Yes.

22:45.157 --> 22:48.329
These guys are so close that you cut
one of them, the other one bleeds.

22:48.394 --> 22:50.030
I think that's
The Corsícan Brothers.

22:50.096 --> 22:51.131
Whatever.

22:51.197 --> 22:53.535
Look, Thomas, the point is,
is I'm getting married...

22:53.600 --> 22:55.637
To a really special woman.

22:55.936 --> 22:58.474
Which, I'm sure,
anyone who met her

22:58.772 --> 23:02.045
would realize without having
had to get to know her

23:02.110 --> 23:04.415
really very well at all, really.

23:04.747 --> 23:06.985
Right. Well, you see...

23:07.551 --> 23:08.753
Well...

23:09.553 --> 23:10.923
I got these two best friends

23:10.987 --> 23:12.757
and I don't wanna
upset either one of them...

23:12.823 --> 23:14.593
Say no more. I know
what you're getting at.

23:14.659 --> 23:17.665
You do? Sure. I know T.C.
and he'll understand.

23:17.929 --> 23:19.732
And I'd be happy
to be your best man.

23:19.797 --> 23:20.865
Oh.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.803
Be right there!

23:23.503 --> 23:24.504
Thank you.

23:27.841 --> 23:31.381
Thomas. Listen, don't say anything to T.C.
until I tell you, okay?

23:31.445 --> 23:32.581
Okay.

24:33.854 --> 24:35.123
Sorry I'm late.

24:35.689 --> 24:37.325
Traffic, traffic, traffic.

24:37.391 --> 24:39.161
Emile, this is T.C.

24:40.395 --> 24:43.434
I knew I should've brought my
industrial strength tape measure.

24:43.499 --> 24:45.502
Like I said, he's the best
in the business.

24:45.568 --> 24:48.675
Now the bride,
of course, will be in white.

24:49.205 --> 24:51.677
Oh, I don't know. I don't think
that's a very good idea.

24:51.741 --> 24:55.014
Well, Cleo, you certainly don't
have to be bound by outmoded ideas.

24:55.111 --> 24:57.049
What do you mean?
What she means to say is,

24:57.114 --> 25:01.223
is that while white used to be
reserved only for young ladies who...

25:01.753 --> 25:04.593
That is to say
young ladies who were not...

25:04.923 --> 25:06.159
I mean, rather...

25:06.226 --> 25:09.031
Oh, you thought I meant
because I used to be a hooker?

25:09.095 --> 25:11.767
No. I just didn't want
to overwhelm Rickey.

25:12.066 --> 25:15.373
You see, my color consultant said
that white was my power color.

25:16.938 --> 25:18.206
Higgins, I need to see you.

25:18.273 --> 25:19.576
Hi, Thomas.

25:19.775 --> 25:21.946
Hello, Cleo, Carol, everybody.
Welcome back.

25:22.011 --> 25:23.079
Now, if you'll excuse us.

25:23.145 --> 25:25.216
I think it's your turn
to be measured, boy.

25:25.449 --> 25:26.818
An experience
you wouldn't wanna miss.

25:26.884 --> 25:29.356
Sorry. It'll have to wait.
Shall we say in the study?

25:30.255 --> 25:31.256
Now?

25:32.457 --> 25:33.726
Jet lag.

25:34.627 --> 25:36.865
You know, I think it's
a very interesting thought...

25:38.765 --> 25:39.886
Bad news about Miss Ellison?

25:39.933 --> 25:40.968
Where is it, Higgins?

25:41.034 --> 25:44.106
Where is what? You know
what I'm talking about.

25:44.438 --> 25:45.706
What makes you think
I've done anything with it?

25:45.773 --> 25:49.681
Higgins, I know what you're
trying to do, but it's a mistake.

25:50.111 --> 25:51.581
Give it to me. Magnum...

25:54.617 --> 25:56.554
I'm trying to make
allowances because

25:56.619 --> 25:59.392
I know you think
you're doing the right thing,

25:59.456 --> 26:02.195
but I suggest you take
a good look at me.

26:52.319 --> 26:53.989
So, Magnum,

26:54.589 --> 26:57.094
you probably weren't
expectíng to hear from me.

27:06.603 --> 27:07.906
Come on, Líly.

27:07.972 --> 27:10.076
I should pack
some thíngs for my husband.

27:10.140 --> 27:12.700
He's brought everythíng he needs
from the offíce. We have no tíme.

27:13.979 --> 27:16.451
Edward,
I'm so sorry about all thís.

27:16.515 --> 27:18.318
It's okay, Míchelle.

27:21.121 --> 27:23.091
No, Líly, there's no tíme.

27:23.156 --> 27:24.926
Líly. Líly!

28:19.491 --> 28:23.867
The first time I heard this, I was horsing
a thunderboat up the Mekong River.

28:23.929 --> 28:25.399
For those of you who were there,

28:25.465 --> 28:28.605
and for you youngsters who think the
Mekong is some kind of video game,

28:28.669 --> 28:33.045
here's the smooth-sounding,
high-stepping Temptations with My Gírl.

28:44.605 --> 28:47.045
Thomas! How're you doing? Come on in.
You're looking good, man.

28:47.107 --> 28:48.710
So are you. How've you been?

28:48.776 --> 28:52.183
Great. So when are you coming over
to my stress syndrome at the VA?

28:52.247 --> 28:54.418
Soon. No, you're not.

28:54.483 --> 28:57.188
Confession's not good
for your soul, secrecy is.

28:57.253 --> 29:00.226
Hell, you're so tight-lipped, you never
even told me why you left the Navy.

29:00.290 --> 29:03.497
I told you, Dave. One day I
woke up when I was 33...

29:03.561 --> 29:05.766
Then, you realized
you'd never been 23...

29:05.830 --> 29:07.934
Exactly. I rest my case.

29:08.333 --> 29:09.868
So? What?

29:09.935 --> 29:11.504
Come on. You're never up
at this hour unless

29:11.570 --> 29:14.176
there's some maior crisis
in the works. Now what is it?

29:14.240 --> 29:17.947
Well, there is a case
that I'm working on.

29:18.011 --> 29:19.079
A car bombing.

29:19.146 --> 29:20.615
The incident was videotaped.

29:20.681 --> 29:23.354
And I stripped the sound
off onto this audio.

29:23.851 --> 29:26.456
I need you to
clarify all the dialog

29:26.521 --> 29:30.229
and background noises, especially
just before the explosion.

29:30.326 --> 29:32.063
You have got to be kidding.

29:32.128 --> 29:34.933
Hey, you're the best
audio engineer I know.

29:34.998 --> 29:36.200
You're asking the impossible,

29:36.266 --> 29:38.269
then giving me a copy of a copy.

29:38.336 --> 29:40.707
You've gotta at least give me the
original videotape to work with.

29:40.772 --> 29:42.208
No, I don't.

29:50.917 --> 29:52.119
Okay.

29:52.319 --> 29:53.622
Let me see what I can do.

29:53.688 --> 29:56.493
Hey, you always told me to bring
my problems to Uncle Dave.

29:56.557 --> 29:58.862
I meant your problems
with beautiful women.

29:59.161 --> 30:02.066
Everything you see here
is state of the art.

30:02.131 --> 30:05.271
Yeah. We like to think we offer
the best security in town.

30:05.335 --> 30:07.673
That's great. Excuse me.

30:12.577 --> 30:14.012
Hi. Magnum.

30:14.078 --> 30:15.314
You look great.

30:15.380 --> 30:17.283
How are you feeling?
Better. Thanks.

30:18.718 --> 30:22.258
Any deliveries or repairs scheduled
for today, Miss Ellison?

30:22.321 --> 30:23.791
Nothing, Mark. Thanks.

30:24.691 --> 30:27.496
So, how long will it take us
to drive to Waimea Falls?

30:27.629 --> 30:29.064
Who said anything about driving?

30:40.410 --> 30:41.980
This is wonderful.

31:04.706 --> 31:06.609
Careful. Thanks.

31:23.995 --> 31:24.996
Oh!

31:27.266 --> 31:28.636
Ordinarily,

31:29.569 --> 31:32.842
people leave breadcrumbs
behind to find their way back.

31:33.006 --> 31:34.342
Thank you.

31:35.476 --> 31:36.477
However,

31:37.779 --> 31:40.584
there's nothing ordinary
about this day.

31:42.417 --> 31:43.653
Come on.

31:44.821 --> 31:47.928
I think you're gonna
love the view of the falls.

32:14.222 --> 32:15.224
Hello?

32:15.524 --> 32:17.527
I didn't wake you, did I?

32:17.694 --> 32:20.098
Me? The orígínal níght person?

32:20.830 --> 32:23.469
What's up?
Did your grandfather call?

32:23.567 --> 32:25.337
No. Was he supposed to?

32:25.903 --> 32:29.678
He called after you left and asked
for your phone number and address.

32:29.808 --> 32:32.013
I guess he's gonna
drop you a note.

32:32.110 --> 32:33.111
Right.

32:33.479 --> 32:34.981
Are you... Are you okay?

32:35.047 --> 32:37.385
Oh, I'm great, Mom.
I'm really great.

32:38.919 --> 32:41.324
There's some things
I figured out that

32:41.722 --> 32:44.260
I really wanna tell you about,

32:44.559 --> 32:47.699
but there's somebody else
that I have to talk to first.

32:47.797 --> 32:50.067
I just wanted
to let you know that

32:50.232 --> 32:51.835
things are gonna be great.
Just great.

32:54.170 --> 32:55.907
Are you there? I'm here.

32:57.474 --> 32:58.677
I'll call you tomorrow.

33:00.077 --> 33:01.280
I'll be here.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.817
I love you. I love you, too.

33:03.882 --> 33:07.022
You saíd you had some changes
to make ín your lífe.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.657
Whoever it is
you have to talk to,

33:10.290 --> 33:12.527
I know I'm gonna love her, too.

33:14.462 --> 33:15.564
Goodbye, Mom.

33:29.380 --> 33:30.749
Thank you.

33:43.463 --> 33:46.035
I wish you could've seen
the look on the waiter's face.

33:46.099 --> 33:48.369
I guess my Thai
is a little rusty.

33:48.436 --> 33:50.773
I don't mean my tie is rusty.

33:50.838 --> 33:53.076
I mean... l know what you mean.

33:53.709 --> 33:55.579
I wonder what we ordered.

33:55.644 --> 33:56.780
I don't know,

33:57.079 --> 33:59.884
but I'm sure
it would've been interesting.

34:06.023 --> 34:07.893
I had a terrific time.

34:09.460 --> 34:11.063
It was very nice.

34:13.165 --> 34:17.107
I'd love
to invite you in, but...

34:17.170 --> 34:19.742
I know. It's a little early.

34:21.175 --> 34:23.580
Well, actually,
it's a little late.

34:24.012 --> 34:25.815
You know what I mean.

34:27.581 --> 34:28.650
Yes.

34:38.563 --> 34:39.563
Good night.

34:40.797 --> 34:41.967
Good night.

35:20.713 --> 35:22.483
So how about lunch?

35:24.551 --> 35:26.855
Maybe breakfast would be better.

36:45.348 --> 36:46.450
Hi, it's me.

36:46.516 --> 36:49.756
Man, where have you been?
I've been trying to reach you.

36:49.987 --> 36:51.724
You'd better get over here.

36:51.788 --> 36:53.291
You're gonna want to hear thís.

37:04.838 --> 37:06.106
Thomas.

37:10.511 --> 37:11.746
Thomas.

37:19.722 --> 37:22.561
Maggie, is there anything about
Lily you haven't told me?

37:22.625 --> 37:23.626
No.

37:26.197 --> 37:27.299
Okay.

37:28.733 --> 37:31.037
Then I want you to look at this.

37:36.876 --> 37:39.181
It's the tape you told me about?

37:41.548 --> 37:43.251
Thomas, if I had known
when I gave you the letter

37:43.317 --> 37:44.586
that it was gonna
turn into this, I wouldn't...

37:44.652 --> 37:45.820
Maggie...

37:46.221 --> 37:48.058
I can't just stand by and...

37:48.123 --> 37:50.126
Maggie, just hear me out.

37:51.694 --> 37:55.068
And then, if you don't wanna
help me, I'll understand.

37:58.936 --> 37:59.937
You know,

38:00.605 --> 38:02.842
I still write letters to Lily.

38:03.507 --> 38:04.910
I never questioned it.

38:05.677 --> 38:07.714
It seemed to help me deal

38:08.313 --> 38:10.050
with what happened.

38:11.050 --> 38:15.393
But, then,
I began to wonder, why? Huh?

38:16.156 --> 38:17.759
I know you might

38:18.559 --> 38:21.465
think I'm a little nuts, but
you know me and my hunches.

38:21.529 --> 38:23.700
And a lot of times,
they pay off.

38:26.168 --> 38:28.506
And so I've done
something about it.

38:29.072 --> 38:32.145
And that's why I want you
to look at this tape.

38:39.818 --> 38:40.886
Come on, Líly.

38:40.953 --> 38:42.924
I should pack
some thíngs for my husband.

38:42.989 --> 38:45.549
He's brought everythíng he needs
from the offíce. We have no tíme.

38:47.061 --> 38:49.365
Edward,
I'm so sorry about all thís.

38:49.429 --> 38:51.700
Thomas, how can you watch this?

38:54.169 --> 38:56.039
No, Líly, there's no tíme.

38:56.305 --> 38:58.375
Líly. Líly!

38:59.175 --> 39:00.778
There. Maggie,

39:01.511 --> 39:03.849
she said, "Búp bê. ".

39:04.447 --> 39:06.251
That is "doll" in Vietnamese.

39:06.317 --> 39:08.454
All right. Now here it is again.

39:10.522 --> 39:12.225
No, Líly, there's no tíme.

39:12.724 --> 39:14.762
Líly. Líly!

39:15.361 --> 39:17.733
All right, did you hear
the tone in Michelle's voice?

39:22.170 --> 39:23.605
No, Líly, there's no tíme.

39:24.272 --> 39:25.975
Líly. Líly!

39:26.941 --> 39:28.979
She said "Lily,"
and then there's a click.

39:29.044 --> 39:31.315
That is the sound of
a car door opening.

39:31.381 --> 39:33.251
It's been positively identified.

39:33.649 --> 39:35.653
Lily got out of the car.

39:38.322 --> 39:40.125
She went to get her doll.

39:40.991 --> 39:43.831
Maggie, she's alive somewhere.

39:43.962 --> 39:45.732
I feel it.

39:47.266 --> 39:49.738
And I need you
to help me find her.

40:04.019 --> 40:06.591
I don't want you
to get your hopes up, Thomas.

40:06.655 --> 40:09.627
I'm going to help you,
if for no other reason

40:10.527 --> 40:13.699
than the fact that you have
to have this resolved.

40:18.503 --> 40:20.541
Just as I promised,
a perfect fit.

40:20.839 --> 40:23.811
Yeah, I don't know. It's still a
little tight in the shoulders.

40:23.877 --> 40:26.649
I can take out the darts
in the back one more time.

40:26.713 --> 40:29.618
And if that doesn't work, we
can always use a Cal COVel.

40:29.683 --> 40:32.855
Yeah. Oh, by the way, I wanted to
ask you if it was all right...

40:32.920 --> 40:34.223
Don't worry about it,
I'm gonna tell him.

40:34.289 --> 40:35.457
I have to wait
for the right time.

40:35.524 --> 40:36.592
Rick.

40:36.658 --> 40:38.695
Hi, Thomas. Emile needs
your measurements.

40:38.760 --> 40:41.399
Yeah, I know, but... l
wasn't talking about Thomas.

40:41.465 --> 40:43.837
Thomas is the other member of the
wedding party I was telling you about.

40:43.901 --> 40:45.470
Don't you know any
normal-sized people?

40:45.536 --> 40:46.938
I was talking about Melody.

40:47.004 --> 40:48.407
I can't do this now, Rick.

40:48.473 --> 40:49.508
I have an appointment.

40:49.573 --> 40:50.809
Thomas! I'll take care of it!

40:50.875 --> 40:52.211
When? Soon!

40:52.877 --> 40:54.213
Was that Magnum? Yes.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.315
Look, if she
gets here early enough,

40:55.381 --> 40:57.461
can she come to the wedding?
I wanted to talk to him.

40:57.484 --> 40:58.552
- Who?
- Melody!

40:58.617 --> 40:59.920
Magnum.

40:59.986 --> 41:01.021
Of course.

41:01.688 --> 41:03.091
These pants don't fit right.

41:12.634 --> 41:13.955
Good evening, Miss Ellison.
Hello.

41:14.003 --> 41:16.207
How are you? How are you? Fine.

41:23.814 --> 41:25.117
Hello. Hi.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.119
Sorry I'm late.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.256
I had trouble getting
away from the studio.

41:29.822 --> 41:30.990
Thank you.

41:31.057 --> 41:32.360
Have you been waiting long?

41:32.592 --> 41:33.694
No.

41:34.061 --> 41:36.499
Oh, it feels good to sit down.

41:36.630 --> 41:40.170
You know, I was not having
a great day until you called.

41:41.135 --> 41:42.170
L...

41:43.072 --> 41:46.044
Lee, I have to talk to
you about some things.

41:46.108 --> 41:48.613
Thomas, you seem so serious.

41:49.612 --> 41:52.719
I don't know how else to say
this except to just say it.

41:52.782 --> 41:56.022
I don't think we should
see each other for a while.

41:56.220 --> 41:58.191
What? I need some time.

41:59.157 --> 42:01.629
There are some things
I have to do.

42:03.662 --> 42:05.165
Wait a minute.

42:06.165 --> 42:08.169
You don't want to see me?

42:08.868 --> 42:10.238
For a while.

42:14.009 --> 42:15.679
Is there someone else? No.

42:17.212 --> 42:18.682
Well, kind of.

42:18.747 --> 42:22.689
The more I say, the worse it sounds
and it isn't what you think.

42:23.786 --> 42:24.922
I just...

42:25.722 --> 42:27.024
I can't talk about it yet.

42:27.492 --> 42:29.429
How do you know what I think?

42:51.720 --> 42:53.323
Can I get you a cab,
Miss Ellison?

42:53.389 --> 42:55.593
Yes. I'll be right back.

43:58.200 --> 43:59.468
Somebody's trying to kill me!

43:59.535 --> 44:00.570
He has a knife!

44:00.636 --> 44:01.772
It's okay, lady. Calm down.

44:01.837 --> 44:03.440
Oh, my God, he's gonna kill me!

44:03.507 --> 44:04.609
Come here. Come on.

44:22.796 --> 44:26.403
I need backup. Suspect on
foot, armed and dangerous.
