Randy, don't fly that in the house.
Go brush your teeth.

01:16.170 --> 01:17.680
Brad, hurry up.
You're gonna miss the bus.

01:17.769 --> 01:21.759
OK. I'm just trying to figure out
what to write for Jennifer's valentine.

01:21.849 --> 01:25.390
Ooh, you got Jennifer a valentine.
Gag me.

01:25.490 --> 01:27.950
- OK.
- All right, all right. None of that.

01:28.049 --> 01:32.039
- All this mushy stuff is stupid.
- You're too young to understand.

01:32.130 --> 01:34.589
Hey. I'm only 1 3 months younger than you.

01:34.690 --> 01:37.400
When you get to be my age
you'll look at girls differently.

01:37.490 --> 01:41.269
- How, like this?
- Hey, enough. Enough.

01:41.369 --> 01:44.400
Randy, go brush your teeth.

01:44.490 --> 01:48.190
So, you got Jennifer a valentine.
That's really sweet.

01:48.289 --> 01:53.039
It's no big deal. I'm just gonna
give it to her at school today.

01:53.130 --> 01:55.720
What do you think?

01:55.809 --> 01:58.079
G.I. Joe valentine.

01:58.170 --> 02:00.160
That's nice.

02:02.089 --> 02:05.789
- What's this thing he's holding?
- It's a flamethrower.

02:05.890 --> 02:07.720
How romantic.

02:10.369 --> 02:14.119
What do ya got?
A G.I. Joe valentine.

02:14.210 --> 02:17.519
Boy, wish I had one of these
for your mom.

02:18.609 --> 02:20.759
I have a box full of them up in my room.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.000
Do you have any with armored
personnel carriers on them?

02:23.089 --> 02:25.279
- I'll go see.
- Great.

02:26.490 --> 02:29.119
So, you're gonna go all out this year, huh?

02:29.210 --> 02:34.440
Honey, don't worry. I'll stop by the carwash
after work, pick you up something special.

02:34.529 --> 02:37.319
Oh. I could use a hot wax and a buff.

02:38.569 --> 02:42.440
You know, what would have been a great
idea is to go to that Stone Creek Lodge.

02:42.529 --> 02:45.640
- Oh. I would have loved that.
- Let's go.

02:45.730 --> 02:48.289
Oh, come on, honey.
You have to call way in advance.

02:48.369 --> 02:51.720
It's Valentine's Day weekend.
It's the busiest time of the year.

02:51.809 --> 02:54.079
You're right. Darn.

02:54.170 --> 02:59.759
Oh… but… what… what do you
suppose this is? Look at that.

02:59.849 --> 03:04.000
"Reservations confirmed for Mr and Mrs
Tim Taylor at the Stone Creek Lodge."

03:04.089 --> 03:07.119
You didn't? You did.

03:07.210 --> 03:10.519
Oh, honey. Oh.

03:10.609 --> 03:13.359
- I just hope you like your room.
- Any room will be fine.

03:13.450 --> 03:15.960
Because you'll be staying at
the honeymoon suite.

03:16.049 --> 03:19.319
The honeymoon suite. Oh, Tim.

03:19.410 --> 03:21.789
You must have made these reservations,
like, two months ago.

03:21.890 --> 03:24.599
- Three.
- Three. Oh.

03:24.690 --> 03:26.400
Three. Oh.

03:26.490 --> 03:28.480
OK, we're going to start early
in the morning.

03:28.569 --> 03:30.759
drop the kids off at
Aunt Helen's on the way.

03:30.849 --> 03:34.799
then I whisk you to a weekend of bliss
at the Stone Creek Lodge.

03:34.890 --> 03:37.960
Oh, Tim. I love it when you surprise me.

03:38.049 --> 03:40.430
Wait till we get to the room.

04:00.690 --> 04:04.680
Welcome back, everybody. I finished
installing that trailer hitch on the bumper.

04:04.769 --> 04:07.640
Luckily, Al was able to find
that fire extinguisher.

04:07.730 --> 04:11.920
Who would have thought
that chrome cleaner was that flammable?

04:12.009 --> 04:16.000
I guess whoever put
the warning on the label, Tim.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.798
OK, Al. Well, we're almost
finished for today.

04:18.890 --> 04:22.400
and I want you to remember that next time,
all next week on Too/ Time

04:22.490 --> 04:25.839
we do our salute to camping.

04:25.930 --> 04:28.640
To preview what's coming up. I'm gonna
ask Lisa to bring out our sponsor

04:28.730 --> 04:32.680
and the president of Binford Tools.
Mr John Binford.

04:35.369 --> 04:38.640
Hi, Tim. Good to be here.
Good to be here.

04:42.250 --> 04:45.319
Thank you. Well, you know. Lisa.

04:45.410 --> 04:49.400
it looks like John's decked out in Binford's
latest line of camping gear, huh?

04:49.490 --> 04:51.599
That's right.
Everything Mr Binford's wearing

04:51.690 --> 04:55.279
is totally insulated and electroheated.

04:55.369 --> 04:58.200
The entire ensemble has 120 volts in it.

04:58.769 --> 05:02.200
Boy, you step out in the rain
and you're a goner, boss.

05:02.289 --> 05:06.240
Not true, Tim. The entire Binford line
is completely water-resistant.

05:06.329 --> 05:10.079
- Just like you.
- You know, just seeing him

05:10.170 --> 05:13.000
in this camping gear makes me want
to take my whole family camping.

05:13.089 --> 05:15.519
- Now that's a good idea, Tim.
- What?

05:15.609 --> 05:19.119
Camping. You should take your whole
family and go out this weekend.

05:19.210 --> 05:21.359
Well, actually.
I got some big plans this weekend.

05:21.450 --> 05:25.680
Then change them. How would you folks
like to see some home movies

05:25.769 --> 05:28.839
of Tim and his family camping?

05:32.410 --> 05:34.279
Well, that's settled, then.

05:34.369 --> 05:39.839
By golly, next week Tim is gonna
have home movies on Too/ Time.

05:39.930 --> 05:43.319
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye, everybody.

05:52.049 --> 05:58.039
Damn. I'm hotter than a hen in a sack.
Get me out of this damn crap, will you?

06:00.730 --> 06:03.720
John. I can't go camping this weekend.

06:03.809 --> 06:05.279
You're not gonna let me down,
are you, Tim?

06:05.369 --> 06:09.400
No. I promised Jill a valentine's
romantic getaway this weekend.

06:09.490 --> 06:12.000
Oh, golly. Well, maybe I can help.

06:12.089 --> 06:15.869
- Mr Binford, why don't I take Tim's place?
- Oh, great idea.

06:15.970 --> 06:19.480
I can take videotapes of me
enjoying the camping equipment.

06:19.569 --> 06:24.920
Who would want to watch a bachelor
talk to himself in the forest?

06:25.009 --> 06:29.440
Wait a minute, Al is real popular on
the show. A lot of people like him.

06:29.529 --> 06:32.359
Well. I'm gonna have to get
cold-blooded about this. I guess.

06:32.450 --> 06:36.680
Tim, you know that you're the finest
salesman that I've ever had.

06:36.769 --> 06:37.799
Thanks. John.

06:37.890 --> 06:40.880
That's the reason that
you're host of the show. Yep.

06:40.970 --> 06:47.069
Tim. I've never said this before, but, well,
you're kind of the son that I never had.

06:48.210 --> 06:52.279
No, it's true. I'd trade all six
of my daughters straight up for one of you.

06:52.369 --> 06:55.160
- Don't say that.
- No, it's the truth.

06:55.250 --> 07:00.480
Well. I've got a whole damn warehouse
full of camping stuff, and I've got to move it.

07:00.569 --> 07:05.160
To put it bluntly, my ox is in the ditch.
Can I count on you?

07:07.529 --> 07:09.039
Absolutely.

07:10.490 --> 07:13.000
I'll get it.

07:15.289 --> 07:17.880
- Hi, Bradley.
- Hi. Jennifer.

07:17.970 --> 07:20.559
Oh, hi. Jennifer.
Come on in. Sit down.

07:20.650 --> 07:24.920
- Oh. I'm sorry. Mrs Taylor. I can't stay.
- Oh, that's too bad.

07:25.930 --> 07:31.160
I didn't see you at school today,
so I couldn't give you your valentine. Here.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.920
Oh, that is so sweet, All those hearts.

07:34.009 --> 07:37.480
- Mom.
- Sorry. I'll be in the kitchen.

07:40.049 --> 07:43.559
Don't you have a valentine for me?

07:45.049 --> 07:46.920
No.

07:47.009 --> 07:48.519
Oh.

07:49.410 --> 07:53.480
But I'll have one to you by Monday.
It'll be a good one.

07:53.569 --> 07:56.029
OK. Bye.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.599
Bye'

08:02.730 --> 08:06.720
Bradley, why didn't you give her
your valentine?

08:06.809 --> 08:10.430
Because Bobby Pilsky gave her
a huge one, and he made it himself.

08:10.529 --> 08:12.680
I'm not gonna give her
a dinky G.I. Joe one.

08:12.769 --> 08:15.680
- Well, why don't you make one yourself?
- I'm not good at that stuff.

08:15.769 --> 08:20.710
Well. I am. Go get some construction
paper. I think I have… Yes, yes.

08:20.809 --> 08:25.240
Some red glitter, and maybe some doilies.

08:25.329 --> 08:27.960
Oh, no. Not doilies.

08:31.049 --> 08:33.720
Oh, oh, honey. I have something
I want to show you.

08:36.250 --> 08:39.839
This is all I'm gonna be wearing
this weekend.

08:44.569 --> 08:47.130
Boy, are you gonna be cold.

08:53.890 --> 08:57.670
- There's been a little change in plans.
- Change. What change?

08:57.769 --> 09:00.960
- Jill, you really love me, don't you?
- Of course.

09:01.049 --> 09:02.920
And we're always gonna
be together, right?

09:03.009 --> 09:07.200
Yes. Unless we're not going to
the Stone Creek Lodge this weekend.

09:07.289 --> 09:09.670
Oh, no.

09:09.769 --> 09:13.039
We're going to the Stone Creek Lodge,
but we're taking a little side trip.

09:13.130 --> 09:14.720
o .

09:14.809 --> 09:17.369
- You're gonna think this is really funny.
- Try me.

09:17.450 --> 09:19.640
OK. Today on on Too/ Time.

09:19.730 --> 09:22.079
I started telling everybody how we
like to go camping as a family.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.599
And we do, don't we?

09:23.690 --> 09:26.599
- Just get to the really funny part.
- OK.

09:28.609 --> 09:32.200
Oh, let me gather myself.
This is just so funny.

09:32.289 --> 09:35.359
I told Mr Binford

09:35.450 --> 09:41.039
that I'd take you all winter camping
and videotape it this weekend.

09:43.009 --> 09:46.400
Well. I guess I won't be needing this.

09:46.490 --> 09:50.000
Jill. I didn't plan it like this.
He cornered me. He offered me a bonus.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.599
It's some camping thing.
I couldn't make him mad.

09:52.690 --> 09:55.359
- But you can make me mad.
- Yeah.

09:55.450 --> 09:58.319
No. No.

09:58.410 --> 10:01.200
But I've got a good idea.

10:01.289 --> 10:06.359
We don't have to camp for the whole
weekend. We just have to look like we did.

10:06.450 --> 10:08.480
- Keep talking.

10:08.569 --> 10:10.640
Now, Wilson says he goes to
this place called Crystal Lake.

10:10.730 --> 10:12.759
It's on the way up North.
It's near Aunt Helen's.

10:12.849 --> 10:16.000
So. I say we go to this Crystal Lake,
we go look like we're camping.

10:16.089 --> 10:17.279
a couple of hours,
have lunch or something.

10:17.369 --> 10:19.799
videotape it, get back in the car,
drop the kids off

10:19.890 --> 10:23.880
and we are at the lodge in front
of a cozy fire.

10:23.970 --> 10:27.440
- It might work.
- Oh, it will work. Trust me. OK?

10:28.210 --> 10:31.079
The last time I trusted you we had Mark.

10:36.690 --> 10:37.800
Come on, boys, sing with me.

10:37.889 --> 10:41.239
A-camµing vve vvi// go,
a-camµing vve vvi// go

10:41.329 --> 10:45.480
Hi-ho, the dairy-o,
ho-ho, ho-ho, ho-ho

10:46.090 --> 10:47.719
Well, that's the spirit, Brad.

10:47.809 --> 10:51.039
Dad. I'm trying to come up with a poem
for Jennifer's valentine.

10:51.130 --> 10:52.760
Oh. I'm sorry.
You're a little stuck there, huh?

10:52.849 --> 10:55.230
Yeah. Take a look.

10:56.730 --> 11:01.039
OK. "I think you're swell.
I think you're sweet."

11:01.130 --> 11:03.320
- You know what could follow this?
- What?

11:03.409 --> 11:05.920
"How would you like to smell my feet?"

11:06.010 --> 11:08.079
Here comes Mom.

11:10.170 --> 11:14.039
- Wow, this is great. Mom.
- Cut, honey. Just cut, cut.

11:14.130 --> 11:17.079
- What took you so long, honey?
- I had a little problem with that hill.

11:17.170 --> 11:18.920
I slid down it.

11:19.010 --> 11:21.360
- Are you all right?
- No. I'm fine. I'm fine. A tree broke my fall.

11:21.449 --> 11:22.199
Oh.

11:22.289 --> 11:23.920
I don't wanna sound
like I'm complaining or anything.

11:24.010 --> 11:26.920
but I'm so cold I can't feel my toes.

11:27.010 --> 11:29.880
- Did you turn on your electric socks?
- No.

11:29.969 --> 11:33.639
I did, and my feet are roasty-toasty warm.

11:33.730 --> 11:38.119
Look, let's just pitch the tent, build the fire,
sing "Kumbaya", and get out of here.

11:38.210 --> 11:40.800
- Give me those instructions.
- OK.

11:40.889 --> 11:43.449
I'm with you a hundred per cent,
my little valentine.

11:43.530 --> 11:48.920
OK, guys, we need some firewood.
So go collect me some, but stay together.

11:49.929 --> 11:53.599
OK, Jill. I want you to start
reading me the instructions

11:53.690 --> 11:57.440
and we'll put this up,
take some pictures, and be all set. Oh.

11:57.530 --> 12:00.320
This new Binford stuff doesn't
look like our tent.

12:00.409 --> 12:04.719
OK. Here it is. It says. "Spread out
the tent body with the floor to the ground."

12:04.809 --> 12:07.159
Piece of cake.
All right, keep… keep reading.

12:07.250 --> 12:12.679
"Join the shock-corded pole sections
to form four poles, each 1 3 feet long."

12:13.690 --> 12:19.480
"The pole sleeves begin approximately
1 5 inches up from any floor webbing loop."

12:19.570 --> 12:23.440
- Are you getting this?
- Does it look like I'm getting this?

12:23.530 --> 12:25.760
"Insert the first two poles
into the two sleeves:'

12:25.849 --> 12:28.079
"After getting two complete poles
through the sleeves,

12:28.170 --> 12:30.630
you place the aluminum-tipped end

12:30.730 --> 12:35.360
into the grommet
of the floor webbing loop." That's this.

12:35.449 --> 12:37.639
- Floor webbing… This. OK.
- Yeah.

12:37.730 --> 12:40.519
"By now it should be partially erect."

12:42.600 --> 12:43.870
- The tent.
- Yeah.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.340
- All right. Now, let me have that.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.429
- No, you see, it goes over here.
- Honey, honey, honey. Let it go, please.

12:48.519 --> 12:49.629
- Well, let me help you.
- Let go of it.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.070
OK.

12:52.159 --> 12:53.220
Honey, honey.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.470
- Are you OK?
- Oh, you punctured my sock battery.

12:56.559 --> 13:00.070
- No, you punctured your sock battery.
- Can you do something else?

13:00.159 --> 13:02.309
- I'll do the tent.
- Well. OK.

13:02.399 --> 13:05.029
I'll set up the camp stove.

13:14.480 --> 13:17.470
They burning tir…
It smells like burning tires, doesn't it?

13:17.559 --> 13:19.629
It's your feet.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.710
And your breath smells fresh, too.

13:21.799 --> 13:23.870
No, no, no. I mean it.
It's your feet, your feet, your feet, feet.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.990
They're smoking.

13:31.960 --> 13:35.710
- Man. I'm starving.
- Me, too. When are we gonna eat?

13:35.799 --> 13:39.230
As soon as Daddy gets back
from the car with the food.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.789
He's been gone a long time.
Maybe he's lost.

13:42.879 --> 13:46.110
If he doesn't come back, you know
what the rule of the forest is?

13:46.200 --> 13:49.190
- What?
- We eat the youngest first.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.950
- Hey. Dad, where's the food?
- It's in the trunk of the car.

13:58.039 --> 14:00.029
Why didn't you bring it? We're hungry.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.350
I got halfway to the car.
I turned right around.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.309
because I think my boys need
some wilderness training.

14:05.399 --> 14:08.230
- What?
- Listen.

14:08.320 --> 14:12.470
You can get lost in these woods pretty
easy. So I have a little test for you.

14:12.559 --> 14:15.019
Where do you think the car is?

14:18.440 --> 14:22.059
- You lost the car, didn't you. Dad?
- It's right where I left it.

14:22.159 --> 14:24.070
Right. I'm gonna go tell Mom
you lost the car.

14:24.159 --> 14:27.149
There's no reason she should
know this. Come here. Stop.

14:27.240 --> 14:30.429
Well, don't you think she's gonna figure
it out when we start walking home?

14:30.519 --> 14:33.509
How long do you suppose you could
survive out here on your own?

14:33.600 --> 14:36.190
You're right.
Mom doesn't need to know.

14:36.919 --> 14:41.350
Hey, honey, you got the tent up,
a fire going.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.309
Yeah, it's easy, you know?

14:43.399 --> 14:46.940
As long as you're just are patient
and you follow the instructions.

14:47.039 --> 14:49.600
And you have your wonderful,
cooperative boys to help you.

14:49.679 --> 14:51.269
- We even got it on video.
- Great.

14:51.360 --> 14:54.590
Now all we need is the food.

14:54.679 --> 14:57.549
- food?
- Yeah. Where is it?

14:57.639 --> 15:00.149
I can't find it.

15:00.240 --> 15:04.549
What do you mean, you can't find it?
It's in the trunk of the car.

15:04.639 --> 15:06.990
Oh, my God. You lost the car?

15:07.080 --> 15:10.549
Honey, don't panic. Don't panic.
I came up here to get my compass.

15:10.639 --> 15:14.149
- Well, what good is that gonna do?
- Honey, now I know where north is.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.870
So? How does that help you find the car?

15:19.679 --> 15:22.990
It's so technical.
It's hard to explain, honey.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.789
Tim, why don't you just admit it?

15:26.879 --> 15:30.029
There is no way we're gonna make it
to Stone Creek Lodge.

15:30.120 --> 15:34.269
Oh, yes, we are, All we got to do
is find the car, get the food.

15:34.360 --> 15:37.629
bring it down here, cook a lunch,
make a video, pack it up.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.509
put the kids in the car,
take them to Aunt Helen's.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.230
and we whisk away to the romantic
weekend at the Stone Creek Lodge

15:42.320 --> 15:44.269
just like I promised.
No matter what you think, we're going.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.990
- Well. I don't think it's gonna happen.
- Well. I'm gonna make it happen.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.710
Tim, you already burned up your socks,
you lost your rod and reel.

15:49.799 --> 15:55.870
now you can't find the car. You're trying
to do too much. It's not gonna happen.

15:55.960 --> 15:59.990
- You're insinuating this is my fault?
- No. I'm not insinuating it's your fault.

16:00.080 --> 16:03.029
I'm saying it. It's your fault.
You, fault. You. Your fault.

16:03.120 --> 16:06.549
I am not gonna stand here and listen
to this. I'm going to the car.

16:06.639 --> 16:08.909
- fine.
- fine.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.639
The car is that way.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.149
Shows how much you know.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.309
Told you.

16:34.639 --> 16:38.070
Brad? Hey, Randy, is that you? Hello?

16:39.200 --> 16:40.509
Hey.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.230
Hi-ho, neighbor.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.220
Wilson?

16:47.320 --> 16:50.269
- Didn't mean to startle you, Tim.
- What are you doing up here?

16:50.360 --> 16:53.830
Well. I always come up here
for Valentine's Day.

16:56.039 --> 16:59.509
Spend time with
my true love. Mother Nature.

16:59.600 --> 17:03.220
Well. I'm glad you're here. I'm lost.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.390
That's why I come up here, Tim.
To lose myself.

17:06.480 --> 17:09.269
Only when you lose yourself
can you begin to find yourself.

17:09.358 --> 17:13.990
I must be really found, because
I'm completely lost. You got a minute?

17:14.079 --> 17:17.269
Well, Tim. I think I can squeeze you in.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.910
for three months I've been planning on
this romantic weekend with Jill.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.230
and I said nothing was gonna
interfere with it.

17:24.319 --> 17:27.309
So, me. Mr Bonehead. I go ahead
and tell Mr Binford that I'm gonna have

17:27.400 --> 17:31.589
a weekend winter camping
with my family the same weekend.

17:32.599 --> 17:36.109
Why did you do that, Tim?

17:36.200 --> 17:39.150
Wilson. I thought I could do both,
you know, and make everybody happy.

17:39.240 --> 17:43.950
Well, Tim, let me tell you a little story,
about a doe.

17:44.039 --> 17:46.630
A deer. A female deer.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.950
You're not gonna break into a song,
are you?

17:50.039 --> 17:54.829
No, no, no, no, no, Tim.
Anyway, once, when I was driving up here.

17:54.920 --> 17:58.539
I came across a young deer
standing in the middle of the road.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.470
And my headlights
were shining directly into its eyes.

18:01.559 --> 18:03.829
She started to move one way.

18:03.920 --> 18:07.539
then she moved another way,
and then she panicked, she froze.

18:07.640 --> 18:11.549
I had to swerve the car to avoid hitting her.
Ended up running into a tree.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.349
Now, the deer was happy, but I wasn't.

18:14.440 --> 18:19.460
If she had chosen one direction and ran,
we both would've been happy.

18:22.880 --> 18:26.579
You see, Tim, when you try to go
in too many directions at once.

18:26.680 --> 18:29.630
you end up going nowhere.

18:29.720 --> 18:32.990
I know what direction I wanna go in.
Right to that Stone Creek Lodge.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.910
- Good for you, Tim.
- But first. I've got to go get my car.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.349
Well. I parked my truck right next to it.
It's 300 yards south by southeast.

18:40.440 --> 18:44.029
- Thank you, Wilson.
- I'll walk with you, Tim.

18:47.880 --> 18:50.339
- Thanks. Mom. This hot chocolate is great.
- Thank you.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.950
- You want some more, sweetheart?
- Yes, please.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.869
- What was that?
- Oh. I don't know.

19:01.960 --> 19:05.740
But don't worry about it.
You're completely safe here.

19:05.839 --> 19:10.029
Hey. Mom, this camping stuff is really fun.
I'm glad Dad wanted to do this.

19:10.119 --> 19:11.869
You are?

19:11.960 --> 19:15.579
Yeah. You didn't have fun putting up
the tent and making the fire?

19:15.680 --> 19:21.630
Well, actually. I've been real focused
on getting to the lodge, but…

19:21.720 --> 19:24.069
I'm having a real good time.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.509
Do you mind if we go over there
and build a snow fort?

19:26.599 --> 19:29.470
No, as long as you don't wander off alone.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.029
Oh, thank God. I was getting worried.

19:39.119 --> 19:41.910
I heard this awful howling.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.509
Oh, that was me.

19:44.599 --> 19:48.140
Couldn't find any leaves.
I had to use a pine cone.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.900
- What are you drinking?
- Oh, it's hot chocolate. You want some?

20:02.000 --> 20:06.390
- Where did you get hot chocolate?
- Well, the boys had a candy bar.

20:06.480 --> 20:09.750
So. I just melted some snow with it.

20:09.839 --> 20:12.670
Wow. It tastes like mint.

20:12.759 --> 20:15.869
I added some toothpaste.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.829
- What is the deal with that string?
- Well…

20:18.920 --> 20:21.710
I found the car.
And I moved it up to this little hill.

20:21.799 --> 20:23.869
so l wouldn't lose it this time,
but just to make sure.

20:23.960 --> 20:27.150
I took this 200-pound test fishing line,
tied one end to the bumper

20:27.240 --> 20:30.150
and the other end's being tied to me.
We're not losing the car again.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.230
You know, Tim, it's getting dark.

20:32.319 --> 20:34.549
I don't think you're gonna be able
to finish that video.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.910
Oh, forget the video. And I'm sorry
I dragged you into this thing.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.349
but right now. I've got one direction.
Right to that Stone Creek Lodge.

20:42.440 --> 20:45.630
Look, Tim, let's be realistic.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.509
By the time we pack up here,
drop off the boys.

20:48.599 --> 20:52.029
drive to the lodge, we're only gonna
have time to fall asleep, check out.

20:52.119 --> 20:54.390
pick up the boys, and go home.

20:54.480 --> 20:58.349
- What? Do you suggest we stay here?
- Yeah.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.309
We can do it. It'll be fun.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.029
Boy. I love you, Jill.

21:04.119 --> 21:09.190
Besides, it doesn't matter
where you are on Valentine's day.

21:09.279 --> 21:12.069
just who you're with.

21:16.720 --> 21:19.950
This is all I'll be wearing tonight.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.470
- Tim?
- Yeah?

21:24.559 --> 21:28.339
Did you say that you parked
the car on a steep hill?

21:28.440 --> 21:31.789
- Did you set the parking brake?
- Why would I wanna do that?

21:31.880 --> 21:33.549
Oh, geez.

21:46.279 --> 21:48.390
I'll be right back.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.430
- What's the matter?
- I can't do this.

21:56.519 --> 21:59.910
- What if she thinks it's stupid?
- She won't. I helped you make it.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.990
And I helped you write the poem.
She'll think it's great. Go on.

22:02.079 --> 22:05.619
Don't leave her standing out there
by herself. Go on.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.829
Here. I made this.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.190
Oh, Bradley.

22:21.279 --> 22:23.910
"I'll give you candy
and I'll give you a flower."

22:24.000 --> 22:26.630
"forget Bobby Pilsky.
I have more power."
