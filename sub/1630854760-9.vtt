WEBVTT

00:02.911 --> 00:05.754
(indistinct chatter)

00:10.845 --> 00:12.636
(woman): Ugh, rapist.

00:14.164 --> 00:15.764
(man): Baby killer.

00:19.928 --> 00:21.870
- Britney, please.
- Jack. Stop.

00:21.947 --> 00:24.857
- I need to talk to her.
- Don't make my job any harder.

00:25.008 --> 00:27.401
Believe me, it's hard enough.

00:36.686 --> 00:38.037
- All rise.

00:38.188 --> 00:40.597
The Lubbock County Court is now
in session,

00:40.599 --> 00:43.584
the Honourable Judge
Bodman presiding.

00:45.028 --> 00:47.504
(tense music)

00:57.132 --> 00:59.266
- And curtain!

01:00.452 --> 01:03.211
Guys, take your bow off
of Hamlet.

01:03.230 --> 01:06.306
Wooo-hooo! Okay great.

01:06.383 --> 01:10.235
And now, orchestra.
Applause, applause, applause.

01:10.312 --> 01:12.071
Milk it, but don't overstay
your welcome.

01:12.222 --> 01:14.298
Especially you, Richie.
(laughing)

01:14.300 --> 01:18.226
And I think that's it.
Thanks everyone, good work.

01:18.304 --> 01:19.745
Now listen, we have Monday,
Wednesday.

01:19.822 --> 01:24.141
Thursday dress, and then Friday
we go, so please, get off book.

01:24.234 --> 01:26.568
Please. And drive safe,
speed racer.

01:26.570 --> 01:28.236
- Oh whatever, it wasn't even
that bad.

01:28.314 --> 01:29.588
- It was pretty bad.

01:29.739 --> 01:32.591
- Hey, Fletch! Can you please
tell Clara to finish up?

01:32.742 --> 01:35.319
Coach'll be pissed if I'm late
for practice again.

01:35.337 --> 01:37.487
- Just tell Coach you're busy
saving the arts.

01:37.506 --> 01:40.265
Stud like you? People might
actually come and see this play.

01:40.342 --> 01:43.009
- I'm good. You can go.
- Cool.

01:43.162 --> 01:44.436
Thanks, babe.
Let's get goin'.

01:44.513 --> 01:47.755
- It's tough being a visionary
in a small town, huh?

01:47.775 --> 01:50.925
- Yo, Fletch, uh, you coming
to the game tomorrow?

01:50.945 --> 01:52.444
- No sorry, I can't.
- Why not?

01:52.521 --> 01:55.339
- Well, believe it or not,
I actually have a social life

01:55.341 --> 01:58.008
that doesn't involve teenagers.
So...

01:58.026 --> 01:59.526
- Yeah, buddy.
I bet you do. Yeah.

01:59.678 --> 02:01.787
- No. I'm not. Stop.
I'm not doing that.

02:01.938 --> 02:03.196
- Come on, man.
- No, no, no, no.

02:03.349 --> 02:05.349
- Come on, Fletch.
- Okay, that's enough for today.

02:05.367 --> 02:07.517
- Later, Fletch.
- Later.

02:07.536 --> 02:11.538
- I have some cleaning up to do
so I'll just be a minute.

02:11.690 --> 02:13.114
- Is everything okay?

02:13.134 --> 02:14.358
- Yeah.

02:14.376 --> 02:16.951
- Really? Because you've seemed
a little...

02:17.029 --> 02:18.786
like off lately.

02:18.864 --> 02:20.455
- I'm fine.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.884
- Then why haven't you handed
in your Hamlet paper?

02:24.386 --> 02:26.203
- Because I haven't
written it yet.

02:26.205 --> 02:28.054
- Well, see? That's what
I'm talking about.

02:28.207 --> 02:29.148
You're never late before,
not even once.

02:29.299 --> 02:31.650
- I'm good, Fletch.

02:31.801 --> 02:33.301
Really.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.711
- Okay.

02:35.472 --> 02:39.716
I'm here, you know.
If you ever need to talk.

02:40.219 --> 02:42.052
(steps approaching)

02:42.054 --> 02:43.537
- Ready to go?

02:44.907 --> 02:46.556
Hey, Clara.
- Hey.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.910
Oh, I'll get you that paper
after the weekend. Okay?

02:50.004 --> 02:50.985
- Thank you.

02:51.488 --> 02:54.322
- They're meeting us at the bar.
- Oh, great.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.675
A drink is needed.
(chuckling)

02:56.902 --> 02:59.419
- Casting the quarterback may
not have been the genius move

02:59.496 --> 03:02.906
I thought it was. He's barely
off book and we go up next week.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.576
- What's up with Clara?
It looked like you two

03:06.595 --> 03:08.470
were having a pretty intimate
conversation.

03:08.505 --> 03:09.837
- Oh yeah, I'm just worried
about her.

03:09.932 --> 03:11.690
Something's going on and she
won't talk about it, so...

03:11.767 --> 03:14.584
- Jack, we're their teachers,
not their friends,

03:14.603 --> 03:16.937
not their therapists.
- I know. I know.

03:17.013 --> 03:20.073
- But... do you?

03:21.593 --> 03:22.776
- She's a good kid.

03:22.928 --> 03:24.444
- Uh-huh.

03:24.596 --> 03:25.946
- What? What's the look?

03:26.098 --> 03:28.690
- As much as you care,
there's a line.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.116
Especially these days.

03:30.269 --> 03:31.935
- Yeah.
- You get that right?

03:31.937 --> 03:33.212
- Of course.
- Okay.

03:33.288 --> 03:35.714
- You're right and thank you.

03:35.791 --> 03:37.365
I love you.
(laughing)

03:37.443 --> 03:40.886
Oh, shoot. I forgot my bag.
I'm so sorry.

03:40.963 --> 03:42.279
I'm so sorry.
I'll be right back.

03:42.297 --> 03:44.297
- Go get it.
I owe my mom a call.

03:44.374 --> 03:46.058
- Alright!

03:47.561 --> 03:50.479
(light music)

03:52.566 --> 03:55.317
(panting)

04:06.972 --> 04:08.538
(shudders)

04:10.084 --> 04:12.459
(tense music)

04:13.145 --> 04:16.404
- Clara! No! No!

04:16.482 --> 04:18.548
(whimpering)

04:22.930 --> 04:25.505
- No!
(struggling)

04:25.657 --> 04:27.266
Let me go!

04:27.993 --> 04:30.160
(grunts)
(panting)

04:30.437 --> 04:32.754
- Clara, what's going on?
What's going on?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.164
(sobbing)
- I can't.

04:34.182 --> 04:36.090
- What?
- I can't.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.184
- Clara, please just talk
to me.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.521
I'm... I'm calling
Principal Gilroy. Okay?

04:41.598 --> 04:44.357
- No. No! Please! No.
- We need to get you some help.

04:44.510 --> 04:46.693
I don't have a choice.
Hey! Hey! Hey!

04:46.845 --> 04:48.102
- No.
(sobbing)

04:48.180 --> 04:50.530
- It's okay, Clara, please.
- No.

04:50.607 --> 04:53.125
- Just give me my phone.
I'm trying to help you.

04:53.201 --> 04:55.294
- You can't help.
You can't help me!

04:55.370 --> 04:57.278
- Will you give me a chance.

04:57.298 --> 05:01.133
- If you tell anyone, I'll do it
again, I swear to God.

05:01.284 --> 05:02.950
I'll do it again
the next chance I get

05:02.970 --> 05:04.118
and you won't be able
to stop me.

05:04.138 --> 05:06.305
- Clara, but why?

05:06.456 --> 05:09.975
(sobs)
- It's my only way out.

05:10.869 --> 05:12.126
(phone buzzing)

05:12.371 --> 05:15.055
- Okay. That's Ms. Thoms.
She's waiting for me outside.

05:15.131 --> 05:17.316
I have to answer.
If I don't pick up,

05:17.467 --> 05:19.818
she'll be here in two minutes.
- Please. Please don't tell her.

05:19.895 --> 05:21.320
Please. Please.

05:21.471 --> 05:24.656
- Okay, okay, I won't. But I
have to answer. Okay?

05:27.235 --> 05:28.160
Hey.

05:28.311 --> 05:30.220
- Do you need help
finding your bag?

05:30.222 --> 05:33.481
<i> - Yeah, no I... no I found it.</i>
<i> Uh, I'm sorry.</i>

05:33.500 --> 05:37.985
Uh, I'm on with Dustin
and he's spiralling.

05:38.063 --> 05:40.321
- Again?
<i> - Yeah.</i>

05:40.341 --> 05:43.416
Um, so why don't you go
ahead without me, okay?

05:43.493 --> 05:45.827
And I'll just get a car and meet
you there.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.905
<i> Buy everyone a round on me.</i>

05:49.332 --> 05:50.998
<i> - Alright.</i>
- Love you.

05:51.076 --> 05:53.060
- Love you, too.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.918
- Clara. Please. Just uh...

06:01.920 --> 06:03.695
just talk to me.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.013
Please.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.575
- I haven't told anyone.

06:09.928 --> 06:11.995
I'm pregnant.

06:12.931 --> 06:14.039
- Okay.

06:14.116 --> 06:17.267
- And I... I can't be.
I can't. My parents...

06:17.285 --> 06:19.044
- Look. Look, look.
- They would disown me,

06:19.195 --> 06:22.288
and they'd rather...
they'd rather disown me

06:22.365 --> 06:24.124
than be embarrassed at church.
- No.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.010
Better disowned than dead.

06:29.205 --> 06:30.296
- Look, I don't...

06:30.391 --> 06:35.209
I don't expect you to understand
my situation,

06:35.303 --> 06:37.787
but my parents cannot find out.

06:37.789 --> 06:39.064
(sniffling)

06:39.215 --> 06:44.403
- Okay, well, um, what about
whoever got you pregnant?

06:45.631 --> 06:47.814
Do you know...
- Of course I know who it is.

06:47.966 --> 06:49.390
- Okay.

06:50.059 --> 06:51.743
- I can't tell him either.

06:53.138 --> 06:54.913
- Uh, did someone hurt you?

06:54.990 --> 06:56.473
- No. It wasn't like that.

06:56.475 --> 07:00.585
- Okay.
- It... it was Richie.

07:00.737 --> 07:02.504
- Richie?

07:06.242 --> 07:10.262
(sighs)
- It was twice.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.008
What's he gonna do about it?

07:15.084 --> 07:16.435
Shelly already hates me enough,

07:16.511 --> 07:18.920
so what's the point
in telling him?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.647
- Well, look, um...

07:22.091 --> 07:26.361
I know that it doesn't seem
like it,

07:27.597 --> 07:30.640
but you have options.

07:30.642 --> 07:32.266
- Adoption?

07:33.102 --> 07:34.953
I would still have
to have the baby,

07:35.104 --> 07:36.196
which means my parents
finding out.

07:36.348 --> 07:40.041
- Yeah, well,
there are other options.

07:41.703 --> 07:43.870
- You mean abortion.

07:44.022 --> 07:45.205
You're not against that?

07:45.357 --> 07:49.259
- It... it doesn't matter
what I am.

07:50.028 --> 07:52.721
Is that what you want?

07:55.033 --> 07:56.624
- I mean...

07:57.703 --> 08:03.707
...sure, but Texas is
a no go, so is Oklahoma.

08:03.725 --> 08:07.510
I tried to find the pills
you can order in the mail

08:07.512 --> 08:09.395
but you need an address they can
mail them to

08:09.472 --> 08:11.323
and obviously I don't have that.

08:11.325 --> 08:15.051
Even if I could get myself
to New Mexico

08:15.070 --> 08:16.811
and find a way to pay for it,

08:16.905 --> 08:19.389
I'd have to find someone with
a license to drive me back,

08:19.391 --> 08:21.407
and I can't ask anybody
to do that

08:21.484 --> 08:23.627
because then everyone
would know.

08:25.230 --> 08:27.672
I'm not an idiot, okay?

08:27.749 --> 08:30.750
But what am I supposed
to do? I can't be pregnant.

08:30.827 --> 08:33.011
I can't. I can't.

08:33.162 --> 08:37.090
- Listen. Here, listen.
Listen to me.

08:37.242 --> 08:40.410
We'll figure it out. Okay?

08:40.503 --> 08:42.020
(sobbing softly)

08:42.097 --> 08:43.688
I promise.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.769
I promise.

08:50.422 --> 08:52.364
- Jack Fletcher wasn't content

08:52.440 --> 08:55.608
simply to teach his students
the curriculum.

08:55.702 --> 09:00.263
He insinuated himself into
their personal lives.

09:00.265 --> 09:03.950
He groomed them to see him
as a peer

09:04.102 --> 09:06.436
so that he could get close
to them.

09:07.289 --> 09:09.956
Many of these relationships
were inappropriate

09:10.108 --> 09:12.533
and constituted an abuse
of power.

09:12.553 --> 09:16.796
But his relationship with
sixteen-year-old Clara Palmer

09:16.873 --> 09:18.223
went even further.

09:18.374 --> 09:20.725
Mr. Fletcher would like
the world to see him

09:20.802 --> 09:23.119
as a caring educator.

09:23.121 --> 09:25.955
An enthusiastic teacher.

09:25.957 --> 09:28.316
But that's not what this man is.

09:28.977 --> 09:31.052
This man right here?

09:31.129 --> 09:32.737
This man is a predator.

09:36.468 --> 09:39.452
(intro music)

09:53.001 --> 09:56.094
(birds chirping)

10:02.661 --> 10:03.676
(knocking)

10:03.753 --> 10:04.844
- Clara?

10:04.996 --> 10:06.771
- Yeah?
- Can I come in?

10:06.848 --> 10:08.164
- Yep.
(door opens)

10:08.183 --> 10:10.683
- Sorry, Sweetie.
Did you take my mascara?

10:10.836 --> 10:11.610
- I don't wear mascara.

10:11.928 --> 10:13.336
- I thought you might
have borrowed it

10:13.338 --> 10:16.097
for your school play.
- No, I didn't.

10:16.766 --> 10:20.118
- Are you alright? We're leaving
in five to pick up my new car.

10:20.195 --> 10:21.845
- I just, I have to sew a bunch
of costumes

10:21.863 --> 10:24.364
for the play and go thrifting.
It's gonna take all weekend.

10:24.516 --> 10:26.349
- But you have to come,
you picked the colour.

10:26.368 --> 10:29.202
- Can you please tell your
mother that she doesn't need

10:29.354 --> 10:32.947
to impress the car salesman?
I've already bought the car.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.299
- Clara says she can't come.

10:34.450 --> 10:36.784
- Oh. Why not?
Come on, it'll be fun.

10:36.862 --> 10:38.452
- I can't go. I'm sorry.

10:38.530 --> 10:40.530
- Alright then,
we should get goin'.

10:40.548 --> 10:43.716
- We got our phones,
you can call.

10:43.793 --> 10:44.967
- See you later.

10:45.461 --> 10:47.520
(door closes)

10:50.466 --> 10:53.026
(light music)

11:00.327 --> 11:02.077
(phone chime)

11:07.501 --> 11:09.459
(chime)

11:11.654 --> 11:12.962
(groaning)

11:15.233 --> 11:17.092
- Coffee?
(chuckles)

11:17.827 --> 11:19.344
- Coffee.

11:24.426 --> 11:26.426
- There you go

11:26.502 --> 11:31.690
and here comes the Jack Fletcher
hangover special.

11:34.194 --> 11:38.279
- Never abandon me
at happy hour again.

11:39.441 --> 11:41.941
- I'm sorry I didn't
make it last night.

11:42.093 --> 11:44.110
- And I'm sorry I don't remember

11:44.262 --> 11:47.188
whatever you told me about
Dustin and his wife.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.131
Are they separating again?

11:49.133 --> 11:54.361
- Um, uh, yeah we'll see.
I um...

11:54.439 --> 11:57.607
I told him I'd drive down
to Odessa today to see him.

11:57.609 --> 11:59.959
- Oh, we have the barbeque
with my family.

12:00.111 --> 12:02.445
- Yes, I know, I um...

12:02.464 --> 12:05.039
I just feel like I have to be
there for him.

12:05.116 --> 12:06.391
- That's okay.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.709
It's just gonna be my brothers
watching the game

12:08.729 --> 12:13.289
and my mom naming every girl
I went to high school with

12:13.291 --> 12:15.275
who's married with kids.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.461
- Well, maybe you two
should set a date.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.129
- Oh yeah?
You're gonna lock this down?

12:20.148 --> 12:22.574
(chuckling)
- You know it.

12:28.898 --> 12:31.624
(soft piano music)

12:34.588 --> 12:35.628
- Hi.

12:35.997 --> 12:37.505
- Hi.

12:39.167 --> 12:42.051
- It's okay if you want
to change your mind.

12:43.079 --> 12:44.971
- Do you?

12:51.012 --> 12:52.395
- No.

12:56.259 --> 12:59.319
(engine rumbling)

13:00.113 --> 13:03.448
(soft emotional music)

13:19.524 --> 13:21.949
- How long have
I been asleep for?

13:22.027 --> 13:23.635
- Uh, about an hour.
A little more.

13:24.362 --> 13:26.696
- I'm sorry it's such
a long drive.

13:26.698 --> 13:28.765
- I don't mind.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.655
(man): Stop abortion!

13:44.899 --> 13:47.216
Stop killing God's baby!

13:47.218 --> 13:50.662
(protests continues)

13:56.319 --> 13:58.044
- I did that once.

13:59.230 --> 14:01.581
With my mom when I was little.

14:01.733 --> 14:05.326
Spent a long time braiding
my hair like we were supposed

14:05.345 --> 14:07.637
to show them what they were
missing or something.

14:09.665 --> 14:12.267
(chanting)

14:23.012 --> 14:25.104
(phone ringing)

14:25.256 --> 14:28.408
(quiet chatter)

14:35.691 --> 14:38.534
- Checking in. Clara Palmer.

14:39.362 --> 14:41.621
- Your appointment was at one.

14:41.697 --> 14:43.548
- I know, I'm sorry, we...
we had a really long drive.

14:43.699 --> 14:46.885
- It's okay. We're always behind
these days.

14:46.961 --> 14:48.945
Fill out these forms here.

14:48.947 --> 14:50.446
The green one is for insurance.

14:50.448 --> 14:52.056
If you're going to need
help with payment,

14:52.208 --> 14:53.799
there are organizations
that can--

14:53.952 --> 14:55.209
- Can I pay with cash?

14:55.286 --> 14:57.228
- Yes. It's $750.
- Okay.

14:57.347 --> 14:59.380
- But you will need to fill out
the section marked

14:59.399 --> 15:02.883
"emergency contact."
- Thank you.

15:02.961 --> 15:06.404
- We'll confirm how far along
you are with an ultrasound.

15:06.481 --> 15:08.573
You don't have to look
at the monitor, okay?

15:09.484 --> 15:11.467
If you're further than
you think,

15:11.486 --> 15:14.245
you may need a medical procedure
to end the pregnancy.

15:14.322 --> 15:16.664
If that's the case,
is someone here with you?

15:17.400 --> 15:18.141
- Yeah.

15:18.143 --> 15:19.626
- Okay, good.

15:22.497 --> 15:26.573
This won't hurt, but you'll feel
some pressure.

15:26.651 --> 15:28.092
- Okay.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.121
- You're measuring just over
seven weeks,

15:57.348 --> 15:59.123
which means you don't
need surgery.

15:59.275 --> 16:00.607
We'll be able to give
you some pills

16:00.627 --> 16:02.460
which will end the pregnancy
over the next few days.

16:03.371 --> 16:07.023
- Can I just do the surgery?
So I know it worked?

16:07.116 --> 16:09.450
- The pills are very effective.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.528
I have a dose here for you now
and there's another medication,

16:12.547 --> 16:16.123
misoprostol, that you'll take
at home in 24 hours.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.393
Does all of that sound okay?

16:18.794 --> 16:19.552
- Yeah.

16:19.813 --> 16:22.981
- Can you hold your hand out
for me?

16:24.300 --> 16:25.984
This is the mifepristone
to take now.

16:26.060 --> 16:28.069
Go ahead and swallow those.

16:36.571 --> 16:37.662
Good.

16:40.149 --> 16:41.648
This has the pills for tomorrow.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.909
When you take them, let them
dissolve in your mouth

16:44.062 --> 16:45.411
before you swallow.

16:45.563 --> 16:48.489
You'll probably start bleeding
pretty quickly after that.

16:48.566 --> 16:50.491
It should feel like
a heavy period.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.086
Try to take it easy over the
next few days, if you can.

16:54.163 --> 16:55.722
- I have school on Monday.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.591
- Bring extra pads.

16:59.502 --> 17:02.520
Here you go.
Let's get you changed.

17:08.844 --> 17:11.571
(phone buzzing)

17:12.590 --> 17:15.091
- Hey. How's it going?

17:15.093 --> 17:16.517
<i>- It's the usual dumpster fire.</i>

17:16.578 --> 17:19.203
I mean, between dealing
with my family

17:19.355 --> 17:23.099
and watchin' football all day
you would have been in agony.

17:23.192 --> 17:26.878
- Well, I love you more than
I hate football,

17:27.029 --> 17:29.047
so I still wish I was there.

17:30.275 --> 17:33.384
But um, I'm kinda in the middle
of it with Dustin,

17:33.386 --> 17:35.278
maybe you can tell me
everything over dinner?

17:35.280 --> 17:37.088
- Is that an invitation?

17:37.164 --> 17:38.539
- I'll call you when I'm close.

17:38.966 --> 17:40.058
- I'll think about it.

17:40.134 --> 17:41.684
- Okay, see ya.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.314
Hi.
- Hello.

17:47.141 --> 17:49.216
Remember, two in each cheek.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.051
Let them dissolve
for 30 minutes.

17:51.129 --> 17:54.054
Ibuprofen for pain.
No aspirin.

17:54.132 --> 17:56.365
- Thank you. Thanks.

18:00.972 --> 18:04.665
- Okay, so should we go?

18:10.331 --> 18:11.923
- Thank you.

18:12.074 --> 18:14.317
Not just for today.

18:15.002 --> 18:17.744
You know, Ms. Thoms
is really lucky.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.263
You're a good guy.

18:19.340 --> 18:23.083
Most girls don't end up
with good guys.

18:23.161 --> 18:25.269
- Well, it doesn't
mean you can't.

18:25.346 --> 18:27.663
(chuckles)
- No offence to you

18:27.665 --> 18:30.108
and Miss Thoms,
but the whole marriage thing

18:30.259 --> 18:32.017
is just kind of a relic.

18:32.094 --> 18:34.337
(chuckling)

18:34.355 --> 18:36.447
- Your parents are together,
aren't they?

18:36.524 --> 18:37.840
- Not exactly, no.

18:38.118 --> 18:42.269
I mean my biological father left
when I was like six months old,

18:42.288 --> 18:45.606
but not until after he ran up
a bunch of charges

18:45.625 --> 18:47.032
and ruined my mom's credit.

18:47.185 --> 18:50.277
You know, we were always getting
kicked out of apartments,

18:50.296 --> 18:53.113
sleeping in the car, and leanin'
on the church.

18:53.133 --> 18:56.617
That's how my mom met
my step-dad.

18:56.694 --> 18:58.118
- At church?

18:58.196 --> 19:00.972
- Yeah. When I was seven.

19:01.123 --> 19:04.142
He owned a hardware store
and I...

19:04.293 --> 19:06.978
think my mom felt like
Cinderella or something.

19:07.054 --> 19:08.888
- Well, that doesn't
sound so bad.

19:09.632 --> 19:12.984
- Yeah, I... I think my mom
was just happy

19:13.060 --> 19:14.694
we weren't broke anymore.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.139
(sniffles, whimpers)
- Are you okay?

19:19.159 --> 19:22.309
- I think it's working. Yeah.

19:22.387 --> 19:23.477
- Okay.

19:23.646 --> 19:25.646
- Ms. Thoms, you can either
swear on the Bible

19:25.665 --> 19:30.042
or make a solemn affirmation
to tell the truth.

19:31.579 --> 19:32.819
- The Bible.

19:33.398 --> 19:35.731
- Place your left hand on
the Bible.

19:35.750 --> 19:37.400
Raise your right hand.

19:38.327 --> 19:40.920
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

19:41.072 --> 19:42.513
and nothing but the truth?

19:42.665 --> 19:43.764
- I do.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.695
- You're home!
- Aw!

20:00.107 --> 20:02.942
- Did someone miss me?
- Horribly!

20:03.094 --> 20:05.185
How'd it go with Dustin?

20:05.279 --> 20:08.748
- Um, I talked him down.
At least for now.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.450
- He's lucky to have
you as a friend.

20:11.602 --> 20:13.436
- Let's uh,
let's get some dinner

20:13.454 --> 20:15.604
and you can tell me about
the rest of your day.

20:15.606 --> 20:19.275
(laughing)
- My mom drank two hard seltzers

20:19.277 --> 20:21.201
without realizing they were
alcoholic.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.036
- Oh no!
- And my father

20:23.056 --> 20:25.038
refuses to acknowledge
how upset he is,

20:25.058 --> 20:26.449
and so he just goes outside

20:26.467 --> 20:28.968
and starts furiously cleaning
his grill.

20:29.044 --> 20:31.044
(car beeping)
- Oh, shoot.

20:31.122 --> 20:33.046
I meant to fill my tank
before but...

20:33.124 --> 20:34.398
- There's a station just up
ahead.

20:34.550 --> 20:38.811
Anyway, you were...
you were so lucky to miss it.

20:38.963 --> 20:41.614
- Ah, apparently.

20:47.062 --> 20:49.321
- Your car is a total mess.

20:49.474 --> 20:51.457
(chuckling)

21:02.670 --> 21:05.429
(tense music)

21:17.852 --> 21:19.527
- What's this?

21:21.339 --> 21:23.572
I found it in your car.

21:25.434 --> 21:27.176
- If you want to be really
horrified?

21:27.194 --> 21:28.511
Check out my desk at school,

21:28.513 --> 21:32.540
I have no idea how half
the stuff gets in there.

21:36.020 --> 21:38.462
Let's go. Come on, I'm hungry.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.544
- Ms. Thoms, please state your
relationship to the defendant.

21:45.696 --> 21:48.213
- Uh, we were engaged for most
of the last year,

21:48.366 --> 21:50.716
and we were together
for two years before that.

21:50.793 --> 21:54.127
- And how would you characterize
your relationship?

21:54.147 --> 21:58.474
- It was loving and fun.

21:59.060 --> 22:01.610
Jack made me happy.

22:04.882 --> 22:06.382
We were getting married.

22:06.384 --> 22:08.659
- But you ended your engagement
with Mr. Fletcher

22:08.811 --> 22:11.737
after his arrest.
- Yes.

22:11.814 --> 22:13.497
- Please tell the court why.

22:20.898 --> 22:22.231
(sighs)

22:22.249 --> 22:25.343
(footsteps approaching)

22:27.013 --> 22:28.404
- My Hamlet essay.

22:28.406 --> 22:29.680
- Oh!

22:29.924 --> 22:34.018
I just hope your thesis isn't
uh, "Hamlet is a soft boy."

22:34.169 --> 22:36.245
- Well, he is. But, it's not.

22:36.338 --> 22:37.688
(chuckles)
- Wait, wait, wait.

22:37.765 --> 22:42.918
Uh, just talk to me for
a second. How are you doing?

22:42.920 --> 22:44.253
- Good.

22:44.255 --> 22:45.754
- Yeah?
- Really.

22:45.756 --> 22:47.531
Oh.
- Hop.

22:48.201 --> 22:51.494
Hey, Fletch. I was hoping
to catch you and uh...

22:53.021 --> 22:54.705
I just sort of had
a personal issue.

22:54.857 --> 22:58.450
- Oh, maybe you should talk
to the counsellor about that.

22:58.527 --> 23:03.547
- Yeah, I barely know her,
and uh, it's about sex.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.510
- O... Okay.

23:08.704 --> 23:09.795
- Um.

23:10.798 --> 23:14.633
So, you know, Shelly and I've
been dating for like a year

23:14.710 --> 23:16.560
and uh...

23:16.712 --> 23:18.312
- And?

23:19.882 --> 23:22.716
- She wants to have sex.

23:22.793 --> 23:24.384
Like, today.

23:24.462 --> 23:27.387
She keeps saying "we're ready"
and obviously,

23:27.465 --> 23:30.658
you know, I want to but uh...

23:31.727 --> 23:33.369
- But what?

23:35.748 --> 23:37.322
- I'm not sure we should.

23:37.399 --> 23:40.233
Like, I don't know if I'm really
gonna wait until I'm married,

23:40.253 --> 23:44.980
but I always thought I might
and I just...

23:44.999 --> 23:46.757
I don't want to regret
it later.

23:46.834 --> 23:49.301
- So you've never had sex?

23:51.672 --> 23:52.430
- No.

23:53.340 --> 23:55.491
And I don't want her
to regret it either.

23:55.493 --> 24:00.062
I don't want to be the guy
who messed her up, you know?

24:07.113 --> 24:09.572
(soft exhale)

24:11.617 --> 24:13.025
- Clara.

24:13.177 --> 24:14.843
- Whoa. Hey.

24:14.862 --> 24:16.454
- Hey. Um...

24:17.848 --> 24:18.939
We need to talk.

24:19.016 --> 24:20.458
- About what?

24:20.685 --> 24:23.794
- Why you told me Richie
got you pregnant.

24:23.946 --> 24:26.855
- You... you talked to Richie?

24:26.857 --> 24:28.040
- Yes.

24:28.192 --> 24:30.042
- Whatever he told you,
he's lying.

24:30.118 --> 24:32.361
- Clara, just cut it out,
okay?

24:32.454 --> 24:35.047
Give me the same respect
that I've always given you,

24:35.199 --> 24:38.142
and just tell me why did you
make up the story.

24:38.293 --> 24:39.885
Are you protecting someone?

24:40.037 --> 24:41.812
- Stop.

24:41.964 --> 24:43.222
- Are you afraid of them?

24:43.298 --> 24:46.025
- Stop. Stop.
- Is it someone at home?

24:46.969 --> 24:48.134
- Stop.
- Your stepfather?

24:48.154 --> 24:50.529
- Stop, stop!

24:51.232 --> 24:53.657
- It was him, wasn't it?

24:54.568 --> 24:56.160
(shuddering)
- Even if it was,

24:56.237 --> 24:58.311
no one would believe me.

24:58.389 --> 24:59.980
He teaches Sunday School.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.333
- Clara, he's abusing you.

25:04.152 --> 25:06.962
- It would destroy my mother.

25:08.082 --> 25:09.748
- What about you?

25:10.676 --> 25:14.845
- You need to let this go.
Okay? It's over.

25:14.997 --> 25:16.555
- Is it?

25:18.166 --> 25:19.591
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry Clara,

25:19.593 --> 25:21.352
but I have to report
this to the police.

25:21.503 --> 25:23.262
- No, you, you told
me you would help me.

25:23.338 --> 25:24.429
- I am.

25:24.765 --> 25:27.340
- You got me the abortion.
You're gonna lose your job!

25:27.360 --> 25:29.026
- We'll both have to deal
with the consequences,

25:29.177 --> 25:31.195
but I can't do nothing.

25:31.272 --> 25:33.072
You understand that, right?

25:34.683 --> 25:36.408
I'm sorry.

25:41.615 --> 25:44.583
(sobs quietly)

25:47.380 --> 25:49.454
(line ringing)

25:49.531 --> 25:52.091
(phone buzzing)
- Hold on one second.

25:54.111 --> 25:55.611
I am sorry,
I just got your text.

25:55.629 --> 25:58.614
- Can you meet me at
my car? We need to talk.

25:58.632 --> 26:00.373
- Can't it wait?

26:00.451 --> 26:02.117
I'm about to step into
a department meeting.

26:02.119 --> 26:04.044
- I need you to meet me now.

26:04.138 --> 26:05.971
- Well, can it wait 30 minutes?

26:06.123 --> 26:07.439
<i> - No.</i>

26:08.142 --> 26:09.716
- What's going on, Jack?

26:09.735 --> 26:12.611
- When I see you, okay?

26:13.147 --> 26:14.738
Please, Britney.

26:14.815 --> 26:16.240
<i> - Okay.</i>

26:21.730 --> 26:24.331
(tense music)

26:38.172 --> 26:40.413
- Are you okay?
What's goin' on?

26:40.491 --> 26:41.990
- I wanted you to hear it
from me

26:42.009 --> 26:43.267
before you hear anything
from anyone else.

26:43.344 --> 26:45.510
- Wait, hear what?
You're scaring me, Jack.

26:45.587 --> 26:47.162
(sighs)

26:47.181 --> 26:50.182
- The other day, when I went
back for my bag.

26:50.258 --> 26:52.517
I found Clara about
to hang herself.

26:52.594 --> 26:54.278
She was standing
on the prop table.

26:54.429 --> 26:55.595
She had an extension cord
around her neck.

26:55.673 --> 26:58.190
- Oh my god.
- No, I got to her just in time.

26:58.342 --> 27:00.008
- Wait. Wait. Is she okay?

27:00.010 --> 27:02.511
- She was pregnant.

27:02.513 --> 27:06.123
She had convinced herself
that was the only way out.

27:07.293 --> 27:11.444
- So, when I called you
and you said Dustin.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.207
- Yeah, that was a...
that was an excuse.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.876
She... she begged me to keep it
a secret.

27:17.953 --> 27:19.970
She threatened to kill herself

27:20.047 --> 27:22.047
if I told her parents
or anyone else.

27:22.199 --> 27:24.591
- I'm not anyone, Jack.
I care about her too.

27:24.668 --> 27:26.459
- Of course, and I wanted
to tell you, Brit,

27:26.537 --> 27:28.812
more than anything.
But I was afraid

27:28.964 --> 27:30.205
that she would go through
with it.

27:30.224 --> 27:32.557
She... she almost did it.

27:32.710 --> 27:35.711
I literally caught her as
she stepped off the table!

27:36.304 --> 27:39.214
- So when you said you
went to see Dustin?

27:39.233 --> 27:42.234
(clears throat)
- I uh...

27:42.310 --> 27:45.496
I was in New Mexico.
I took Clara to get an abortion.

27:45.647 --> 27:46.889
- Jack.

27:46.907 --> 27:49.057
- What else could I do?
What?

27:49.076 --> 27:50.575
She was going to take
her own life.

27:50.728 --> 27:53.504
- Well, what about the life
she was carrying?

27:55.082 --> 27:56.006
- What would you have done?

27:56.083 --> 27:57.524
- I don't know.

27:57.601 --> 27:59.343
But I would have never lied
to you.

27:59.494 --> 28:02.237
I've never given you reason
not to trust me.

28:02.256 --> 28:03.496
Not to talk to me.

28:03.590 --> 28:05.590
And now you've put me in this
horrible position

28:05.667 --> 28:08.243
of keeping this secret
or blowing up our lives.

28:08.262 --> 28:10.412
- Britney, I'm not asking you
to keep any secrets.

28:10.431 --> 28:13.023
I'm going to the police
to tell them everything.

28:13.100 --> 28:14.191
- The police? Why?

28:14.342 --> 28:16.527
- Because things have...

28:16.754 --> 28:19.196
gotten a little bit more
complicated than I thought.

28:19.347 --> 28:21.181
- More complicated how?

28:21.258 --> 28:22.591
- Jack Fletcher?

28:23.260 --> 28:24.517
Turn around and put your hands
on the car.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.060
- What's goin' on?
- Why?

28:26.062 --> 28:27.371
- Jack Fletcher, you're under
arrest for statutory rape.

28:27.448 --> 28:28.521
- What?!

28:28.599 --> 28:29.707
- You have the right
to remain silent.

28:29.934 --> 28:32.284
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

28:32.378 --> 28:33.877
in a court of law.
- This is insane!

28:34.029 --> 28:35.379
- You have the right to an
attorney.

28:35.530 --> 28:37.548
If you can't afford one, a
lawyer will be provided for you.

28:37.624 --> 28:40.050
- This is a mistake, alright.
You have to trust me.

28:40.202 --> 28:41.367
- Let's go.

28:41.445 --> 28:43.595
- This is a mistake.
You have to trust me!

28:47.226 --> 28:50.477
- Defence calls Clara Palmer.

28:51.288 --> 28:54.481
(crowd whispering)

28:59.313 --> 29:01.480
- Ten students
and five faculty members

29:01.574 --> 29:04.633
were deposed by the District
Attorney and by me.

29:04.635 --> 29:08.746
Those depositions have been
given to the jury.

29:08.822 --> 29:09.988
Have you read them?

29:10.641 --> 29:13.066
Would you say
they were consistent

29:13.143 --> 29:15.068
in their characterization
of your relationship

29:15.087 --> 29:16.161
with Mr. Fletcher?

29:16.238 --> 29:20.332
- Yes, they were all,
uh, consistent.

29:20.426 --> 29:23.243
- Everyone described
Mr. Fletcher as an advocate,

29:23.262 --> 29:26.246
a fierce believer
in your intelligence,

29:26.323 --> 29:28.766
in your talent
and in your future.

29:28.917 --> 29:30.517
Is that an accurate description?

29:30.936 --> 29:32.252
- It was.

29:32.271 --> 29:35.347
- Before your claim that
the relationship between you

29:35.499 --> 29:37.274
and Mr. Fletcher became sexual.

29:37.425 --> 29:38.366
- Yes.

29:38.593 --> 29:42.337
- Can you explain why no one
ever witnessed

29:42.339 --> 29:45.690
one inappropriate moment
between the two of you.

29:45.767 --> 29:49.936
- He took me to get an abortion.
That's inappropriate.

29:50.014 --> 29:51.680
- Yes, it is. And it's illegal.

29:51.698 --> 29:55.017
But it's a far cry from
the statutory rape charge

29:55.035 --> 29:57.519
he's facing because
of your allegation.

29:57.521 --> 30:01.799
Mr. Fletcher acted against
his own moral judgment

30:01.950 --> 30:03.449
because you were in crisis.

30:03.527 --> 30:06.211
Because you threatened to kill
yourself if he didn't,

30:06.363 --> 30:08.213
isn't that right?
- No.

30:08.365 --> 30:11.624
- Mr. Fletcher risked his job,
his relationships,

30:11.644 --> 30:17.039
and his freedom in order
to help you, didn't he?

30:17.041 --> 30:18.148
- Asked and answered,
Your Honor.

30:18.225 --> 30:20.375
- Sustained.
- Miss Palmer,

30:20.394 --> 30:23.153
can you provide any
concrete evidence

30:23.230 --> 30:26.882
that the relationship with
Jack Fletcher became sexual?

30:26.900 --> 30:28.216
- No.

30:28.235 --> 30:30.977
- Because the relationship
with Mr. Fletcher

30:31.055 --> 30:33.479
never became sexual,
isn't that right?

30:33.557 --> 30:36.149
- It's because he got rid of all
the evidence

30:36.168 --> 30:37.483
when he took me to get
the abortion.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.244
- Clara, please don't do this.

30:39.396 --> 30:41.204
- You will not address
the defendant directly,

30:41.281 --> 30:43.006
is that clear?
- She's lying. She's scared!

30:43.083 --> 30:44.733
(gavel pounding)
- One more word

30:44.735 --> 30:46.751
and I will have you removed
from this courtroom,

30:46.828 --> 30:48.086
do you understand?

30:48.238 --> 30:50.347
- Yes, Your Honor.

30:58.673 --> 31:00.732
(door opening)

31:04.771 --> 31:07.990
(soft music)

31:35.135 --> 31:37.477
- It's so good to see you.

31:38.956 --> 31:40.305
Um they set bail at uh...

31:40.382 --> 31:42.290
a hundred grand and they know
I can't afford that.

31:42.309 --> 31:45.360
- Of course they set it high,
it's a crime against a minor.

31:46.813 --> 31:49.055
- Except I didn't do it.

31:49.133 --> 31:50.574
- Then why would
she say you did?

31:51.468 --> 31:53.301
- Wait. What? You don't
seriously believe I...

31:53.395 --> 31:55.746
- I don't know what to believe.

31:55.897 --> 31:57.563
(sighs)

31:58.400 --> 32:01.234
- I never... I never
touched her, Brit.

32:01.328 --> 32:03.420
I never even looked
at her that way.

32:03.497 --> 32:06.998
Look, she told me that Richie
had gotten her pregnant

32:07.151 --> 32:11.077
and I believed her and then,
afterward,

32:11.155 --> 32:14.431
I found out that it was actually
her stepfather

32:14.582 --> 32:16.491
who had been abusing her for God
knows how long.

32:16.510 --> 32:21.680
- I keep getting blind-sided!
I mean, look where we are!

32:21.774 --> 32:23.181
- I know.

32:24.351 --> 32:29.187
And I'm sorry. I told her I had
to tell the police,

32:29.264 --> 32:30.280
that's why I went to talk
to you.

32:30.507 --> 32:32.565
- I was planning
my life around you.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.860
- We can still have that life.

32:35.937 --> 32:37.621
- How?

32:38.273 --> 32:40.123
I don't even
know who you are.

32:41.109 --> 32:43.034
- I'm the same person
I've always been.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.854
- Well, if that were true,
we wouldn't be here.

32:46.873 --> 32:50.950
- Brit, she's freaked out,
but she'll come to her senses

32:51.044 --> 32:53.862
and we'll get through this.
Everything we talked about.

32:53.997 --> 32:57.048
Buying land, having kids.
- Kids?

32:57.201 --> 33:00.385
- Yes. Yes. You, me, a family.

33:00.462 --> 33:02.204
That's still all
that matters to me.

33:02.206 --> 33:05.148
- How can you say that
after what you did?

33:05.300 --> 33:08.652
- What I did was try to help
a girl in trouble.

33:08.803 --> 33:10.344
- Even if that's true.

33:10.397 --> 33:14.216
Even if I choose to believe
that you didn't do

33:14.234 --> 33:16.218
everything that they're sayin'.

33:16.220 --> 33:20.998
You still took an underage girl,
a kid, to get an abortion.

33:21.149 --> 33:23.149
That wasn't for you to decide.

33:23.227 --> 33:25.410
- Do you think I wanted to get
involved?!

33:26.654 --> 33:28.913
Maybe if she had better options
I wouldn't have had to.

33:29.066 --> 33:30.549
- Even so.

33:31.993 --> 33:35.161
You did it.
And you lied about it.

33:35.997 --> 33:38.598
And you didn't think about
what that would do to us?

33:42.021 --> 33:44.354
My mom was 19

33:45.098 --> 33:47.024
when she got pregnant

33:48.193 --> 33:50.418
and she didn't think that
she wasn't ready.

33:51.104 --> 33:53.438
She didn't think she couldn't
do it.

33:53.590 --> 33:54.680
And so

33:54.867 --> 33:59.185
she was walking into an abortion
clinic when someone,

33:59.263 --> 34:03.373
a complete stranger, convinced
her to change her mind,

34:04.025 --> 34:06.460
to keep her baby.

34:07.695 --> 34:09.046
To keep me.

34:09.864 --> 34:14.867
So for me this isn't just about
my faith, it's who I am.

34:14.961 --> 34:17.429
- No, Brit! Brit! Brit.

34:18.131 --> 34:20.298
(door buzzing)

34:20.450 --> 34:22.300
- When Mr. Fletcher was
arrested, he told the police

34:22.452 --> 34:24.969
that your stepfather had gotten
you pregnant.

34:25.122 --> 34:27.397
Did your stepfather
get you pregnant?

34:28.216 --> 34:31.309
You never said that?
- No.

34:32.145 --> 34:33.461
- To your knowledge,
did Mr. Fletcher

34:33.480 --> 34:36.031
ever report your stepfather
to the authorities?

34:37.910 --> 34:40.135
- Only after he was arrested.

34:40.228 --> 34:41.653
- That's convenient.

34:41.729 --> 34:43.972
Please tell the court what
happened when you told

34:43.990 --> 34:45.398
Mr. Fletcher you were pregnant.

34:45.475 --> 34:47.325
- He told me he would
take care of it.

34:47.402 --> 34:49.994
- And by "take care of it,"
did he mean destroying evidence

34:50.147 --> 34:51.313
of the illicit relationship

34:51.331 --> 34:53.406
he'd instigated with
his underage student?

34:53.483 --> 34:54.740
- Leading the witness,
Your Honor.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.318
- Sustained.

34:57.003 --> 34:59.245
- How did you pay
for your abortion?

34:59.323 --> 35:02.157
- I didn't. Mr. Fletcher did.

35:02.159 --> 35:05.677
- How? Cash or a check?
Credit card?

35:05.829 --> 35:06.919
- Cash.

35:06.939 --> 35:08.939
- So he could keep your
relationship hidden

35:09.015 --> 35:11.775
and untraceable.
- Conjecture, Your Honor.

35:11.926 --> 35:12.925
- Sustained.

35:13.520 --> 35:17.114
- How long had your relationship
been going on?

35:17.282 --> 35:19.023
- I don't know, I don't...

35:19.100 --> 35:21.701
- Weeks? Months?

35:23.029 --> 35:26.531
Approximately when did it start?

35:26.608 --> 35:27.999
- Spring.

35:28.943 --> 35:32.704
The first time was in his car.

35:32.856 --> 35:35.206
He was driving me home.

35:36.360 --> 35:39.861
There was a baseball game on
the radio, so it was spring.

35:39.880 --> 35:42.288
He pulled his car over.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.141
- So this had been going
on for several months.

35:44.292 --> 35:46.384
- Yes.
- I need to talk to Britney.

35:46.536 --> 35:48.961
- You know you have to
convince the jury, not her.

35:49.039 --> 35:50.355
- And how's that goin'?

35:51.799 --> 35:54.634
Please. Let me use your phone
so I can text her.

35:54.653 --> 35:57.136
- Sometimes he would ask me
to stay after school

35:57.156 --> 35:59.230
to work on costumes
for the play.

35:59.307 --> 36:00.824
- And to your knowledge
did he ever ask

36:00.901 --> 36:02.583
any other students to stay late?

36:02.585 --> 36:04.995
- No. Not usually.
- Why didn't you tell anyone.

36:05.146 --> 36:06.997
- Because he told me that...

36:07.148 --> 36:08.481
that people would assume
that I wanted it.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.668
(phone buzzing)
I didn't want it. Not once.

36:11.819 --> 36:12.744
- I have no further questions.

36:12.896 --> 36:14.229
The prosecution rests,
Your Honor.

36:14.398 --> 36:17.841
- This court will recess for 15
before closing arguments.

36:17.992 --> 36:20.969
(gravel pounding)
- All rise.

36:35.677 --> 36:37.510
- She did great back there.
You did great.

36:37.587 --> 36:39.863
We got about 15 minutes till
the Judge calls us back in,

36:40.014 --> 36:41.589
I'm gonna get a beverage.
Anybody thirsty?

36:41.591 --> 36:43.867
- We're uh, we're good,
thank you.

36:43.944 --> 36:45.535
- Okay.

36:46.763 --> 36:48.020
- Sweetie. What's going on?

36:48.040 --> 36:50.874
- She's just nervous.

36:51.101 --> 36:52.267
Hey.

36:52.269 --> 36:54.527
Everything's okay.

36:54.579 --> 36:58.632
I got this, Jessica.
Just give us a minute, okay?

37:00.702 --> 37:03.127
(tense music)

37:03.204 --> 37:05.055
There, you see.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.116
You see, you're worrying
your mom.

37:08.118 --> 37:10.209
What'd she ever do to deserve
all this?

37:10.287 --> 37:12.395
- I can't do this
to Mr. Fletcher.

37:12.547 --> 37:14.064
- You already have.

37:14.791 --> 37:15.723
- Mrs. Palmer.

37:16.217 --> 37:17.216
- Ms. Thoms...

37:17.310 --> 37:19.236
- Can we talk?
Somewhere private?

37:19.387 --> 37:22.647
- Whatever you have to say
you can say it right here.

37:23.558 --> 37:25.742
- Mrs. Palmer, I've seen you
at Church

37:25.893 --> 37:29.729
and I believe you and I share
a deep devotion to Jesus Christ.

37:29.806 --> 37:32.824
So you don't need me to explain
how grave a sin it is

37:32.976 --> 37:34.233
to bear false witness.

37:34.253 --> 37:36.494
- What are you suggesting?

37:36.646 --> 37:39.422
- Your daughter is lying about
what happened.

37:39.574 --> 37:43.835
I wasn't sure what to believe
myself, not at first.

37:43.911 --> 37:45.971
- But you are now?

37:47.266 --> 37:50.267
- Jack never denied taking
Clara to New Mexico to

37:50.494 --> 37:54.262
terminate her pregnancy.
Which I'm still struggling with.

37:54.922 --> 37:57.107
But these other charges,

37:57.183 --> 37:59.167
Jack would have never done
the things

37:59.185 --> 38:01.352
that Clara's accusing him of.

38:01.505 --> 38:03.596
- This is almost over, alright,

38:03.615 --> 38:08.009
but until it is, get a grip
and keep your mouth shut.

38:08.102 --> 38:09.344
- I think I've heard enough.

38:09.346 --> 38:11.179
- Then it's time to start
listening.

38:11.197 --> 38:13.364
If not to me,
then to your own daughter.

38:13.441 --> 38:15.775
- What are you bothering
my wife about?

38:15.852 --> 38:17.443
- Clara invented this story

38:17.462 --> 38:19.354
because she's trying
to protect you.

38:19.356 --> 38:22.524
- Leave my family alone.
I'm warning you.

38:22.617 --> 38:25.117
- Clara, Jack cares about you,
always has.

38:25.137 --> 38:26.377
He doesn't deserve this.

38:26.530 --> 38:29.364
- I warned you to leave
my family alone!

38:30.142 --> 38:34.536
- No, Frank. You leave us alone.
- Come on Jessica,

38:34.538 --> 38:37.004
you're not gonna let this woman
get you all turned around.

38:37.006 --> 38:38.464
- Don't you touch me!

38:38.542 --> 38:41.818
Don't you touch me
or my daughter ever again!

38:41.895 --> 38:42.819
- Ma'am?

38:42.896 --> 38:44.821
- She is my daughter!

38:44.898 --> 38:47.715
She is my daughter!

38:47.717 --> 38:49.275
How could you?!

38:49.386 --> 38:51.161
- What is goin' on?
- How could you?!

38:51.312 --> 38:53.163
- What is goin' on?
Is everything okay here?

38:53.314 --> 38:55.999
(sobbing)
- How could you?

39:05.159 --> 39:07.093
(door opening)

39:12.333 --> 39:14.667
- Clara's recanted her
testimony.

39:15.579 --> 39:17.595
She's giving a new statement
to the police.

39:17.672 --> 39:20.415
They've taken her stepfather
into custody.

39:20.433 --> 39:22.842
(relieved sighs)

39:22.861 --> 39:25.177
As to the charges against you,

39:25.197 --> 39:27.346
they're gonna drop everything

39:27.424 --> 39:31.034
except transporting a minor
across state lines

39:31.261 --> 39:33.703
without parental consent.
- Okay. Okay.

39:33.855 --> 39:35.205
- I'm not promising
you anything,

39:35.281 --> 39:37.949
but I'm pretty confident I can
cut a deal with the DA,

39:38.101 --> 39:40.118
get you probation.

39:40.194 --> 39:42.027
You'll probably lose your
teacher's licence,

39:42.047 --> 39:43.605
at least in Texas,

39:43.623 --> 39:46.290
but at least you won't be
a registered sex offender.

39:46.367 --> 39:51.871
- Oh. Thank you,
thank you, Emmett. Really.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.557
- You can thank your fiancée.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.268
Good luck, Jack.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.366
- Hi.

40:14.137 --> 40:16.804
Thank you for believing me

40:16.898 --> 40:19.082
and for saving me.

40:20.160 --> 40:22.660
- You're a good man, Jack.

40:23.255 --> 40:25.130
- I've really missed you.

40:25.999 --> 40:28.816
- I miss you too.

40:28.818 --> 40:30.409
But I...

40:30.429 --> 40:33.680
I still can't get past
what you did.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.476
- Maybe you will, in time.

40:39.329 --> 40:41.345
Nothing's black and white.

40:41.498 --> 40:45.108
- Some things are.
At least for me.

40:46.503 --> 40:52.690
You know, I... kept not being
able to throw this away.

40:52.767 --> 40:56.936
At first I thought it was
evidence of something

40:57.013 --> 40:58.288
between you and Clara,

40:58.439 --> 41:03.084
but then I realized it was
a kind of sign.

41:04.296 --> 41:11.301
Some things break and are meant
to stay broken.

41:13.046 --> 41:15.263
And that's okay.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.643
(soft emotional music)

41:26.726 --> 41:28.359
Yeah.

41:54.254 --> 41:55.553
- Hey.

41:56.256 --> 41:58.264
- Hey.

42:00.927 --> 42:02.477
Heard the run went well.

42:03.170 --> 42:05.438
- I heard that too.

42:06.525 --> 42:08.691
- The show must go on, right?

42:14.424 --> 42:19.443
- I think I'm gonna hate myself
forever for what I did to you.

42:19.596 --> 42:24.356
- Oh I don't want that.
Don't do that.

42:25.268 --> 42:28.527
- You don't... you don't have
to be nice to me.

42:28.547 --> 42:32.090
I don't think I deserve
you being nice to me.

42:35.202 --> 42:37.387
- Clara, look at me.

42:39.057 --> 42:41.099
We're okay.

42:41.801 --> 42:44.060
And all I ever wanted

42:44.896 --> 42:47.522
was for you to be okay.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.608
You know that, right?

42:52.553 --> 42:55.129
You're a kid, I'm not mad
at you.

42:55.148 --> 42:57.574
You're just a kid.

42:58.577 --> 43:01.327
(sobs quietly)

43:28.848 --> 43:32.984
Subtitling: difuze
