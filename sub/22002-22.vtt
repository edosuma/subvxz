this is a rec center.

00:03.580 --> 00:05.280
- It looks amazing.
- You look amazing.

00:05.330 --> 00:06.516
- Foxy as hell.
- Simmer down, Boyle.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.680
- No, no, I love it.

00:07.720 --> 00:08.826
- Amp it up, Boyle.
- Happy to.

00:08.850 --> 00:10.160
Jake, your body's kicking

00:10.200 --> 00:11.520
and skin is clear
as a summer day.

00:11.550 --> 00:13.030
- Ooh!

00:13.070 --> 00:15.340
- Jake.
- Ames, you look beautiful.

00:15.380 --> 00:16.486
But when are you
getting your makeup put on?

00:16.510 --> 00:18.300
Y'all, she woke up like this.

00:18.340 --> 00:19.706
- Not now, Jake.
- We're in crisis mode.

00:19.730 --> 00:21.170
The cake hasn't arrived yet.

00:21.210 --> 00:22.316
Mason woke up
with the chickenpox,

00:22.340 --> 00:23.536
so we don't have a ring bearer.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.170
Plus, look
what I found on my veil.

00:25.220 --> 00:26.690
- Ooh.
- I planned everything

00:26.740 --> 00:28.366
so perfectly,
and now it's all falling apart.

00:28.390 --> 00:29.830
- No, it isn't.
- Take a deep breath.

00:29.870 --> 00:31.260
All right, we got this.

00:31.310 --> 00:32.790
Terry, Rosa, will you please

00:32.830 --> 00:34.400
take this veil to a dry cleaner.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.076
And if they won't do
a rush job, make them.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.490
Use force.

00:37.530 --> 00:38.636
- I mean, we're not
gonna abuse our power.

00:38.660 --> 00:40.100
- Of course not.
- We're good cops.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.540
I was just exaggerating.

00:41.580 --> 00:42.840
Rosa, I was not exaggerating.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.450
- Great.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.580
- Okay, now for
the ring bearer situation.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.256
This actually might be
a blessing in disguise.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.590
I know that he's your nephew,

00:49.630 --> 00:50.826
but I wasn't
super jazzed about Mason.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.370
- Yeah, he should be cuter.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.370
- His face is too small
for his head.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.810
He's a "Dick Tracy" villain.

00:54.850 --> 00:56.096
But I have an idea
for a new ring bearer

00:56.120 --> 00:57.380
who is very adorable

00:57.420 --> 00:59.600
- and very obedient.
- I would be...

00:59.640 --> 01:00.796
- I'm talking about
Cheddar the dog.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.300
- Yep, right.
- Brilliant.

01:02.340 --> 01:03.756
He loves responsibility.
I'll go pick him up.

01:03.780 --> 01:05.470
- I'm gonna go with Holt.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.186
Seems like people are
pairing off for adventures

01:07.210 --> 01:08.740
and we have the best rapport.

01:08.780 --> 01:10.220
Are you crazy?

01:10.260 --> 01:12.390
What about my... Got
your meds right here.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.130
I brought them just in case

01:14.180 --> 01:15.416
Hitchcock decided
to wear his toupee again.

01:15.440 --> 01:16.586
It's very clearly
not human hair.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.400
- Human hair is indistinguishable
from badger fur.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.596
- That is absolutely
not the case.

01:20.620 --> 01:22.140
But that reminds me, you two,

01:22.190 --> 01:23.466
our wedding band
cancelled last minute,

01:23.490 --> 01:24.686
and I need you
to find a replacement.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.230
- You can count on us.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.866
- Flattop and The Freak.
- We always deliver.

01:27.890 --> 01:29.840
- Not in any way, shape or form.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.516
But it's a very stressful day
and I thought things would

01:31.540 --> 01:33.126
go better without
Hitchcock and Scully here.

01:33.150 --> 01:34.590
- Aw, that's so smart.

01:34.630 --> 01:36.590
- Look, babe, we planned
a great wedding.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.160
It's gonna be a perfect day.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.250
- Phone call for you sir.
- Ah, thank you.

01:40.290 --> 01:42.290
That would be the cake guy
saying he has arrived.

01:42.340 --> 01:43.600
Hello?
Jake Peralta?

01:45.160 --> 01:46.276
- There's a bomb
at your wedding.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.600
It's set to explode at 5:30.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.430
Everyone inside will die.

out of the building.

He's probably gonna

- I'm calm because
there's not really a bomb.

02:37.700 --> 02:38.976
I mean, if you're
trying to kill someone,

02:39.000 --> 02:40.496
you don't call and
give them a heads-up.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.310

trying to scare us?

02:42.350 --> 02:43.856
- Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
- The bomb squad's on their way.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.896
They'll do a quick sweep,
find nothing and split, and

02:45.920 --> 02:48.230
this will just become a funny
story we work into our vows.

02:48.270 --> 02:50.660
"Amy, there was a bomb
at this wedding.

02:50.710 --> 02:53.670
Ya butt.
Ya butt is da bomb."

02:53.710 --> 02:55.296
- Please don't say that
during the ceremony.

02:55.320 --> 02:56.556
- Is it that you don't like
wordplay or you don't

02:56.580 --> 02:58.280
want me to talk about
your butt at all?

02:58.320 --> 02:59.906

is really gonna pull a thread.

find out about the wedding?

03:02.020 --> 03:03.500
The stupid
engagement announcement

03:03.550 --> 03:04.850
Charles put in the paper!

03:04.900 --> 03:06.680
It had the time and location
of the ceremony.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.860
- Amy, be very careful about
throwing around accusations

03:09.900 --> 03:11.006
like that, because
if you're trying to say

03:11.030 --> 03:12.860
I somehow ruined Jake's wedding,

03:12.900 --> 03:14.990
then I'm gonna kill myself!

03:15.040 --> 03:17.260
So tread lightly.

The bomb squad is already here.

03:22.610 --> 03:24.520

03:24.570 --> 03:25.830
This is exactly how I imagined

03:25.870 --> 03:27.350
my wedding would be
when I was a kid.

Your ex-boyfriend is here
on our wedding day.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.880
- Why?
- This is my crew.

03:34.930 --> 03:36.906
Yeah, you called me boring,
so I leveled up my cool.

03:36.930 --> 03:39.320
And now I run the bomb squad.
I also started traveling.

03:39.370 --> 03:41.280

out on the table here.

03:42.930 --> 03:45.280
Last time we saw you,
you kind of proposed to Amy.

03:45.330 --> 03:46.436
So you're not still
in love with her, right?

03:46.460 --> 03:47.940
- No, I definitely am.

03:47.980 --> 03:49.786
My therapist told me
to stop trying to get over it.

03:49.810 --> 03:51.396

hide it even for your own pride.

03:57.510 --> 03:58.836
a super thorough sweeping
of the building.

03:58.860 --> 03:59.966
It's gonna take hours,
so you should

03:59.990 --> 04:01.016
probably just cancel
the wedding.

someone to the wedding?

04:07.610 --> 04:09.530
- No, I'm taking a break
from dating for a while.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.416

how many siblings they have.

between zero and two?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.220
- Look, I was told to drop off

06:59.260 --> 07:01.650
one Nakatomi Plaza
wedding cake at 2:15.

07:01.700 --> 07:03.286
- Yeah, but they won't
let us inside the venue,

07:03.310 --> 07:05.066
so can you please take it away
and bring it back later?

07:05.090 --> 07:07.180
- Sorry, ma'am, I can't.
- I have other deliveries.

07:07.230 --> 07:09.270
- Man, it's gonna
melt in the sun.

07:09.310 --> 07:10.856
- Don't worry, Amy,
I'm gonna keep it chilled

07:10.880 --> 07:12.490
with my cool breath.

07:12.540 --> 07:14.060
- Oh, my God,
the cake looks amazing!

07:14.100 --> 07:15.580
Charles, why are
you spitting on it?

07:15.630 --> 07:17.190
- Because I didn't
ruin your wedding.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.630
- Kay.

07:18.670 --> 07:19.906
- Were you able to
trace the number

07:19.930 --> 07:20.890
- that called in the threat?
- Yes.

07:20.930 --> 07:22.590
It was a burner, but

07:22.630 --> 07:23.916
they caught it pinging
off a cell tower in Fort Greene

07:23.940 --> 07:26.200
one block away from
the last known address

07:26.240 --> 07:27.250
of Frank Gillespie.

07:28.770 --> 07:29.966
- I arrested him
for armed robbery in 2008,

07:29.990 --> 07:31.136
and he got out of Rikers
a year ago.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.510
He's got be my arch-nemesis.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.860
He's definitely
obsessed with me.

07:35.340 --> 07:37.096
- Well, we didn't have
enough evidence against him

07:37.120 --> 07:38.576
at first, so let's just say
I had to get a little creative.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.780
No. Ames.

07:40.820 --> 07:42.716
I went undercover and
became best friends with him.

07:42.740 --> 07:44.156
And then he told me
about his lymphoma,

07:44.180 --> 07:46.920
and we ran a 10K together,
and then I arrested him.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.880
He felt so betrayed.
The trial was very emotional.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.660
- All right,
let's go talk to him.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.246
- That must be our guy.
- Hey, great attitude, Ames.

07:53.270 --> 07:54.550
You're handling this
really well.

07:54.580 --> 07:55.930
Ah, there they are.

07:55.970 --> 07:57.710
- All right, she
should be here any minute.

07:57.750 --> 08:01.110
Her name is Alicia.
Switch with me.

08:01.150 --> 08:02.800
That's your good side.

08:04.370 --> 08:05.386
- All right, can we just
focus on finding the veil?

08:05.410 --> 08:06.890
- Really, it's not a big deal.

08:06.940 --> 08:08.330
I'm sure it's in her car.

08:08.370 --> 08:09.850
Oh, there she is.

08:09.900 --> 08:12.250
Do you mind if I slyly
mention you're single?

08:12.290 --> 08:14.250
- Do not do that.
- You won't even notice.

08:14.290 --> 08:15.640
- Hey, you needed
to see me again?

08:15.690 --> 08:16.770
- Rosa's single.

08:16.820 --> 08:18.300
- Ignore him.

08:18.340 --> 08:20.056
We left a dry cleaning bag
in your back seat.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.650
- Oh, uh, I didn't see anything,
but you can take a look.

08:22.690 --> 08:25.220
- The veil's not here, Rosa.
- We're so screwed!

08:25.260 --> 08:27.090
- Hold on.
- Don't freak out.

08:30.130 --> 08:36.100
♪

08:36.140 --> 08:37.100
- Rosa!

08:37.140 --> 08:38.320
What the hell are you doing?

08:38.360 --> 08:39.929
You were the one that said...

08:39.970 --> 08:41.296
- That was before
the veil went missing,

08:41.320 --> 08:43.150
when life was breezy!

08:43.190 --> 08:45.800
Why is this so heavy?

08:45.850 --> 08:47.980
- 'Cause you made them do
an all-frosting interior.

08:48.020 --> 08:50.280
- Oh, yeah.
- I can't wait to eat it.

08:51.810 --> 08:53.266
- Well, Gina,
there was a bomb threat;

08:53.290 --> 08:54.940
Teddy won't
let us in the building;

08:54.990 --> 08:56.900
and we had to get our cake
out of the sun; and

08:56.940 --> 08:59.340
now you're in charge of it so
we can go find my arch-nemesis.

08:59.380 --> 09:00.340
- All right.

09:00.380 --> 09:01.950
- Thank you very much.

09:01.990 --> 09:04.430
- Don't know.

09:04.470 --> 09:07.130
They only said "Gina" once, and
it was kind of in the beginning.

09:07.170 --> 09:08.430
- Huh.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.910
Are you the commissioner?

09:09.960 --> 09:11.350
- I haven't opened it yet.

09:11.390 --> 09:12.936
- Today is Peralta
and Santiago's wedding.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.660
I don't want to
make it all about me.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.350
- Don't be absurd.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.050
I simply want
everyone to focus on

09:18.100 --> 09:20.230
the bride and groom,
and not on whether

09:20.270 --> 09:23.800
my lifelong dream, which
I spent decades working towards,

09:23.840 --> 09:25.160
has collapsed
in front of my eyes,

09:25.190 --> 09:27.320
leaving me
untethered in this world

09:27.370 --> 09:30.890
and unsure of my very future
with the NYPD.

09:30.930 --> 09:32.460
- All right.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.810
- Okay, Gillespie's apartment's
right over here.

09:34.850 --> 09:37.131
- Oh, this is exciting. We're
gonna catch my arch-nemesis.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.696
Do you think he has a shrine of
photos of me

09:38.720 --> 09:39.680
with the eyes scratched out?

09:39.730 --> 09:41.340
- Let's not rule out

09:41.380 --> 09:42.836
the very real possibility
that it's entirely sexual.

09:42.860 --> 09:44.006
- Oh, man, that
would be super upsetting

09:44.030 --> 09:45.210
and so cool.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.210
- I know.
- Isn't it amazing?

09:46.250 --> 09:47.650
- Okay, okay, focus up.

09:47.690 --> 09:48.870
- Let's do this.
- Right.

09:48.910 --> 09:50.740
You look great.

09:50.780 --> 09:52.830
NYPD.

09:52.870 --> 09:54.910
Is there a problem?

09:54.960 --> 09:56.196
- We're looking for
Frank Gillespie.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.000
He died a year ago.

09:58.050 --> 10:00.050
- What happened?
- Well, his lymphoma came back.

10:00.090 --> 10:02.490
But really, it was
the loneliness that killed him.

10:02.530 --> 10:04.010
Somebody hurt him, and he just

10:04.050 --> 10:05.450
couldn't make friends
after that.

10:05.490 --> 10:07.270
- So it seems like
he died because of me.

10:07.320 --> 10:09.360
Just gonna lock that up
in a little box in my brain

10:09.410 --> 10:10.760
and never open it.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.216
- Hey, do you remember
Dario Moretti,

10:12.240 --> 10:13.930
that money launderer I arrested?

10:13.980 --> 10:15.330
He lives right around here too.

10:15.370 --> 10:17.070
- He hated me.

10:17.110 --> 10:19.810
What if this is the work of
my arch

10:19.850 --> 10:22.290
- So you're suggesting
I'm not involved in this at all?

10:22.330 --> 10:24.340
I mean,
you hear yourself, right?

10:24.380 --> 10:26.420
- That's a bit of a stretch.
- Yeah, Amy.

10:26.470 --> 10:29.040
- Are you actually mad
that someone might not hate you?

10:29.080 --> 10:30.470
- Yeah, I am, Amy!

10:30.520 --> 10:31.926
Oh, wow, that's
a bad color on me, isn't it?

10:31.950 --> 10:33.276
All right, fine,
we'll check out your guy

10:33.300 --> 10:35.060
and I'll be totally fine
with it if it's him.

10:35.090 --> 10:37.350
Oh, man, you got a whole shrine!

10:37.390 --> 10:39.520
Even the eyes
are all scratched out.

10:39.570 --> 10:41.326
- Babe, when we're married,
we're gonna share everything.

10:41.350 --> 10:44.140
Bank accounts, health insurance,
arch-nemeses.

10:44.180 --> 10:46.336
- Aww, that's nice, Ames,
but you don't have to say that.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.896
Charles, will you put this
picture of me up on the wall?

10:47.920 --> 10:48.880
- Copy that.
- You want the eyes scratched out?

10:48.930 --> 10:50.060
- Uh, you know I do.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.410
- Lieutenant Wells!
- Where is Teddy?

10:54.450 --> 10:55.540
- Hi, Jakey.
- Aunt Linda.

10:55.580 --> 10:57.020
What are you doing here?

10:57.060 --> 10:58.020
How'd you get past
the police barricade?

10:58.060 --> 10:59.590
- Well, I moved them.

10:59.630 --> 11:01.590
Now, I know I was
supposed to come here solo,

11:01.630 --> 11:03.420
but I had to
invite my friend Barb.

11:03.460 --> 11:05.120
She was so down in the dumps.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.396
- Yeah, that's all fine.
- Don't worry about it.

11:06.420 --> 11:08.070
Actually, you know what?
That's not fine.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.240
Barb can't be here. You
can't just add someone day of.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.040
- Teddy, meet Dario.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.510
He has a wall
full of Amy photos,

11:13.560 --> 11:15.390
and he's the one
that made the bomb threat.

11:15.430 --> 11:17.080
- And I'm Aunt Linda.

11:17.130 --> 11:18.406
- Okay, Aunt Linda,
I love you but you gotta go.

11:18.430 --> 11:19.936
Okay? Thank you.
Give us a moment here.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.066
All right, Dario,
tell Lieutenant Wells

11:21.090 --> 11:22.220
what you told us.

11:22.260 --> 11:24.180
- Okay, I've hated
Detective Santiago

11:24.220 --> 11:25.546
since she arrested me,
and then I saw

11:25.570 --> 11:27.310
that engagement announcement
in the paper.

11:27.350 --> 11:28.466
- But you could have figured out
where the wedding was

11:28.490 --> 11:29.440
even without that, right?

11:29.490 --> 11:31.010
- No, I was trying.

11:31.050 --> 11:32.290
I had totally given up, really.

11:33.970 --> 11:36.230
- Anyway, I made the threat,
but there's no bomb.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.020
- Just like
I've been saying all along.

11:38.060 --> 11:40.060
Now, can we please
go back in the venue?

11:40.110 --> 11:41.476
- First of all, there's
nothing inherently creepy

11:41.500 --> 11:42.670
about a wall of Amy photos.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.240
- Uh-huh.
- Secondly,

11:44.280 --> 11:45.306
I'm not gonna just
take this guy's word

11:45.330 --> 11:46.680
for it that there's no bomb.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.460
He's the one who would know.

11:48.510 --> 11:50.266
- So you think a cop should
just stop what they're doing

11:50.290 --> 11:52.096
as soon as a criminal
tells them they didn't do it?

11:52.120 --> 11:54.430
- Oh, my God! That is
actually a really good point.

11:54.470 --> 11:55.950
- So I only had one passenger

11:55.990 --> 11:57.470
after you, and he got off here.

11:57.520 --> 11:58.690
- I don't know.

11:58.730 --> 12:00.146
I mean, he was wearing
some dumb hat.

12:00.170 --> 12:01.626
I'm sorry,
I know that's not helpful...

12:01.650 --> 12:03.220
All hats are dumb.

12:03.260 --> 12:04.480
- Ha!

12:04.520 --> 12:06.220
Is that your laugh?

12:06.260 --> 12:08.310
Also, quit vibing,
and help me solve this.

12:08.350 --> 12:10.350
- Sorry, man.
- It's what the universe wants.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.440
- Screw the universe.
- The universe is a dick.

12:12.490 --> 12:14.156
- Maybe it fell out
when he got out of the car.

12:14.180 --> 12:15.450
- Wow, you are so smart.

12:15.490 --> 12:17.930
- Oh, oh, yep, yep, yep.
- Here it is.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.410
Uh-oh.
It's kind of dirty looking.

12:20.450 --> 12:22.556
But, you know, that's why they
put it in a dry cleaning bag.

12:22.580 --> 12:24.370
I'm sure everything inside
is totally...

12:24.410 --> 12:26.110
Nope.
Soaked in urine.

12:26.150 --> 12:27.980
Damn it, New York.

12:29.810 --> 12:33.120
- Kay, you've been staring
at your phone for 45 minutes.

12:33.160 --> 12:35.210
Just read the email.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.486
- Sir, do you know
how many times

12:36.510 --> 12:37.966
I've not gotten
something that I wanted?

12:37.990 --> 12:39.080
- Zero.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.430
Because I have a trick.

12:40.470 --> 12:42.040
Whatever that email says,

12:42.080 --> 12:44.210
you just act like that's
what you wanted all along.

12:44.260 --> 12:45.716
- Well, I can't fake it.
- I want this job.

12:45.740 --> 12:47.430
For years,
I've worked nights and weekends.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.000
I've sacrificed friendships.

12:49.050 --> 12:52.090
I've jeopardized
my relationship with Kevin.

12:52.140 --> 12:56.490
And now... to find out
if it was all in vain.

12:56.530 --> 12:57.750
- Yeah, let's not check it.

12:57.790 --> 12:59.450
It feels like
there's a lot on the line.

12:59.490 --> 13:00.450
- Agreed.

13:00.490 --> 13:02.450
Let's just grab Cheddar
and go to the wedding.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.500
Where is he?
Cheddar?

13:04.540 --> 13:06.670
Cheddar!

13:06.710 --> 13:09.410
Cheddar the dog!

13:09.460 --> 13:10.680
Oh, he ate the cake.

13:10.720 --> 13:14.160
- Oh, Cheddar,
you furry little pig.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.680
- Okay, Amy.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.526
I got through every room
and I cleared them very fast,

13:17.550 --> 13:19.266
because I love you
and I want you to be happy,

13:19.290 --> 13:20.486
even if it's with somebody else.

13:20.510 --> 13:21.706
- Did that new tactic work?
- No.

13:21.730 --> 13:23.210
- You just called it a tactic.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.560
- Can we get in
the venue or not?

13:24.600 --> 13:26.300
- Not quite yet.
- There's one more vent

13:26.340 --> 13:28.260
we can't get into,
and our snake cam broke.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.586
We got another one on the way.
It'll be here in about 6 hours.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.180
No.
We need it now.

13:32.220 --> 13:33.586
- People are already here.
- I'm sorry.

13:33.610 --> 13:34.716
The vent is very tight,
and no one

13:34.740 --> 13:35.766
on my team can get into it.

13:35.790 --> 13:37.066
I've been doing a lot of Pilates

13:37.090 --> 13:38.370
so I'm pretty huge
at this point.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.230
- I'm going in.

13:40.270 --> 13:41.750
Look, this is all my fault.

13:41.790 --> 13:43.360
I put the announcement
in the paper

13:43.400 --> 13:44.710
and ruined this day.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.126
And now I'm gonna be
the one to fix it.

13:46.150 --> 13:47.360
Get ready, you two.

13:47.410 --> 13:51.150
I'm about to save this...
Bomb! There's a bomb!

13:51.190 --> 13:53.126
- Damn it, Dario.
- Why'd you say there was no bomb?

13:53.150 --> 13:54.500
- Because I wanted to kill Amy.

13:54.550 --> 13:56.070
- Then why did you
call in the threat?

13:56.110 --> 13:57.436
- I didn't.
- My daughter found my hidden room

13:57.460 --> 13:58.770
and discovered some blueprints.

13:58.810 --> 14:01.200
Yes, fine, Teddy.
You were right.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.576
Now can you please
get the bomb out of the vent

14:02.600 --> 14:03.656
and dispose of it somewhere?

14:03.680 --> 14:05.030
- Honestly, I wish we could.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.186
But it's too dangerous to move.

14:06.210 --> 14:07.510
We have to diffuse it on site.

14:07.560 --> 14:08.576
I have to evacuate
this entire block.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.560
It's gonna take all night.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.560
- Wait, so you're saying...
- Wedding's off.

14:11.610 --> 14:14.220
For real, it's over.

14:14.260 --> 14:17.310
- Jakey, what's this that
I hear that there's no rabbi?

14:17.350 --> 14:18.440
- Not now, Aunt Linda!

14:21.490 --> 14:23.330
- Okay, so we just finished
processing Moretti.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.686
- Did you talk to our parents?
- Yeah.

14:24.710 --> 14:25.816
They ended up
having dinner together.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.320
It sounded like they had fun.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.556
Our dads only got in
one arm-wrestling match.

14:28.580 --> 14:29.840
- Neither.

14:29.890 --> 14:30.840
They both threw out
their shoulders.

14:30.890 --> 14:32.630
What a disaster.

14:32.670 --> 14:34.630
- Yeah.
- But, look, I know

14:34.670 --> 14:37.540
it seems like
everything sucks, but

14:37.590 --> 14:39.330
why don't we just
get married tomorrow?

14:39.370 --> 14:40.956
You know, we won't have
a venue or a band

14:40.980 --> 14:43.680
or any of our guests,
but we could go to city hall.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.340
- Jake, do you really
want to get married

14:45.380 --> 14:47.396
in the same place people go
to get restraining orders?

14:47.420 --> 14:50.170
- Amy Santiago, I would
marry you any time, any place.

14:50.210 --> 14:51.706
I would marry you
in the steaming filth

14:51.730 --> 14:52.820
of the Gowanus Canal.

14:52.860 --> 14:54.610
- Sweet.
- But also, gross.

14:54.650 --> 14:56.196
- I would marry you on
the G Train in the summertime

14:56.220 --> 14:57.620
when the air conditioning
is broken.

14:58.570 --> 14:59.586
- I would marry you on top of

14:59.610 --> 15:00.790
the Empire State Building.

15:00.830 --> 15:01.790
- Well, that sounds
kind of nice.

15:01.830 --> 15:02.846
- During a King Kong attack.

15:02.870 --> 15:04.350
- Oh, yeah, that's not good.

15:06.620 --> 15:09.360
Okay.
City hall it is.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.620
- No!
- I was eavesdropping.

15:11.670 --> 15:13.426
- I'm always eavesdropping.
- I don't like it.

15:13.450 --> 15:14.816
- Look, I didn't spend
the last seven years

15:14.840 --> 15:16.386

only to have it

You're getting married

Boyle, I don't
even have a dress.

- I'm sure it's white.

15:24.680 --> 15:25.746

Gina was gonna wear

15:25.770 --> 15:26.826

I thought you'd just wear
