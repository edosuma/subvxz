00:09.800 --> 00:13.220
( Computer beeping )

00:13.320 --> 00:16.340
( Beatboxing )

00:16.440 --> 00:17.660
S'up, Pops?

00:17.760 --> 00:18.740
What's good?

00:18.840 --> 00:20.660
( Whimpers )

00:20.760 --> 00:23.860
( Sobbing )
âUm, you okay, Pops?

00:23.960 --> 00:25.300
( Sobbing )

00:25.400 --> 00:26.380
Both: Whoa!

00:26.480 --> 00:29.340
( Screams )

00:29.440 --> 00:31.500
âUh...
âWhat the ââ

00:31.600 --> 00:34.220
Aah!
Gotcha, ya stupid parasite!

00:34.320 --> 00:35.300
( Grunts )

00:35.400 --> 00:36.940
Hey, Pops!

00:37.040 --> 00:39.200
Got to catch those things
before they destroy the ship

00:39.280 --> 00:40.420
and kill us all.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.820
( Whimpers )

00:42.920 --> 00:43.900
( Sobs )

00:44.000 --> 00:45.660
Uhh...

00:45.760 --> 00:47.780
Okay.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.980
( Sighs, whimpers )

00:50.080 --> 00:52.220
Hey, Pops, want to go
on a supply run with us?

00:52.320 --> 00:55.060
On the way, we're gonna see
how close we can fly to a sun.

00:55.160 --> 00:58.540
( Sobbing )

00:58.640 --> 01:02.040
Uh, okay.
Your loss, bro!

01:03.040 --> 01:05.040
( Door closes )
Guys, we got to figure out

01:04.360 --> 01:05.780
what's got Pops
so bummed out.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.880
Maybe he just misses
Earth stuff ââ

01:07.240 --> 01:09.240
like wrestling
and twoâply toilet paper?

01:09.040 --> 01:10.540
Maybe it's because
we have to drink

01:10.640 --> 01:12.900
recycled garbage water
all the time?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.780
( Spits )
Wait, we drink <i>what?</i>

01:14.880 --> 01:17.220
( All speaking indistinctly )
Um, guys?

01:17.320 --> 01:19.100
( Clears throat loudly )

01:19.200 --> 01:21.900
( Dramatic music plays )
You think that maybe
Pops is sad

01:22.000 --> 01:24.460
because in less than 24 hours,
we'll reach Lolliland,

01:24.560 --> 01:26.220
where he'll have
to face AntiâPops,

01:26.320 --> 01:28.820
his superâevil twin brother,
and figure out

01:28.920 --> 01:31.780
how to save us
and the entire universe...
( Dramatic music swells )

01:31.880 --> 01:33.860
from being erased
from existence?

01:33.960 --> 01:36.260
( Music stops )
Yeah, it's probably
that one.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.360
We need to get
his mind off of all that.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.880
Before the battle tomorrow,
let's make it our mission

01:39.960 --> 01:41.140
to show Pops a good time.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.540
âYeah!
âLet's do it.

01:43.640 --> 01:46.300
âA song ââ for me?
âYeah.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.920
( Beatboxing )
( Rapping )
Lookin' good, Pops,
cool new magical abilities

01:49.000 --> 01:51.320
And I've always been impressed
by your fashion sensibilities

01:51.400 --> 01:53.400
( Laughs )
So cheer up, Pops
( Beatboxing )

01:52.880 --> 01:54.780
There's no need to cry

01:54.880 --> 01:56.880
You'll fight AntiâPops
tomorrow, and you probably
won't die

01:56.760 --> 01:57.940
You're gonna win
the fight

01:58.040 --> 01:59.540
So, till then,
let's have some fun

01:59.640 --> 02:01.640
And if ya don't,
well that's all right

02:00.960 --> 02:02.960
We'll all be erased
from existence anyway.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.420
âDude!
âOw!

02:03.520 --> 02:05.060
( Sobbing )

02:05.160 --> 02:07.100
Rigby!
Sorry, I couldn't think
of a rhyme.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.100
âHey, Pops!
âSurprise!

02:09.200 --> 02:10.220
We made you a cake.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.140
A cake ââ for me?

02:12.240 --> 02:15.580
Benson:
It's your favorite ââ red velvet
with raspberry filling.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.260
Let's cut you
a big old piece.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.360
Eileen: This will
make you feel better.

02:19.000 --> 02:19.980
Uh...

02:20.080 --> 02:21.620
( Whispering )
Help me!

02:21.720 --> 02:23.820
( Screams, sobbing )

02:23.920 --> 02:25.780
Hey, Pops,
check it out ââ

02:25.880 --> 02:28.260
Here comes
the big show!

02:28.360 --> 02:30.660
âRun!
âOh, I love firingâworks.

02:30.760 --> 02:34.280
( Fireworks whistling, popping )
It's beautiful.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.020
( Sobbing )

02:39.120 --> 02:40.780
Muscle Man: Well,
that was a total bust.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.920
We were doing fine until
your stupid fireworks.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
What are
you talking about?

02:44.160 --> 02:45.980
Those fireworks were
very festive.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.300
âNo, they weren't!
âYes, they were!

02:48.400 --> 02:50.180
They were totally
freakin' festive!

02:50.280 --> 02:51.300
That's it!!

02:51.400 --> 02:52.700
Guys, I know
what we've got to do.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.580
What's the one thing guaranteed
to cheer anybody up?

02:55.680 --> 02:58.900
The wet burrito combo platter
at Chimichanga Juan's?

02:59.000 --> 02:59.980
What? No.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.100
I don't know.
It's pretty good.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.900
I really like
how wet they make it.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.380
No, guys, I'm talking
about a surprise party!

03:08.480 --> 03:10.480
( Upbeat rock music plays )
Both: Hm! HmâHm!

03:09.760 --> 03:11.420
( Computer beeps )

03:11.520 --> 03:13.740
( Singsong voice )
Microwave wings,
microwave wings.

03:13.840 --> 03:14.820
( Engine revs )

03:14.920 --> 03:16.580
( Doorbell rings )

03:16.680 --> 03:18.060
Hey, you made it.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.460
Bummer about whole
endâofâtheâuniverse deal.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.260
Oh, we brought chips!

03:22.360 --> 03:24.860
Honey barbecue
and zesty lime.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.580
( Doorbell rings )
Rigby: Hey, Death!

03:26.680 --> 03:27.940
Thanks for coming out.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.420
Oh, it's no problem.
I was headed out here anyway.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.980
( Doorbell rings )
Hey, hey!

03:32.080 --> 03:34.780
âGlad you could make it.
âOf course.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.780
And we brought some HDâDVDs
we thought Pops might enjoy.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.340
To use as coasters.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.020
Then, we can watch
some of my movies

03:41.120 --> 03:43.020
as they're meant to be seen,
on Bluâray.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.180
Come on! I though you said
you'd give me that one.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.200
Yeah, but those discs aren't
gonna cheer anyone up.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.700
They're literally trash.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.140
( Chuckles nervously ) Okay.
Yeah, come on in.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.700
( Static crackles )
The eagle's approaching
the nest.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.800
Got it.
Everyone, get in position.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.660
All: Surprise!
Oh, my!

04:00.760 --> 04:03.140
A party ââ for me?

04:03.240 --> 04:04.980
Yeah, Pops, for you!

04:05.080 --> 04:06.220
How lovely.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.820
And all
of my friends are here.

04:08.920 --> 04:12.180
Oh, but what's the occasion?
It's not my birthday.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.980
Hey, you don't need to have
a reason to have a party.

04:15.080 --> 04:18.060
Well, then let's get
this shindig started.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.900
( Laughs )

04:20.000 --> 04:23.600
( Disco music plays )

04:25.600 --> 04:27.300
( Chuckles )

04:27.400 --> 04:31.000
( Acoustic guitar music plays )

04:51.440 --> 04:53.420
Oh, yeah

04:53.520 --> 04:56.260
( Cheering )
All right.
Hey, let's get Pops up here.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.860
Come on up, Pops.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.960
Pops?
Rigby: Where'd he go?
Hey, Pops?

04:59.240 --> 05:01.620
Hmm.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.820
â( Sobbing )
âHey, Pops, you okay?

05:04.920 --> 05:07.860
( Sobbing ) Oh, yes!
Jolly good party!

05:07.960 --> 05:09.780
Just getting
some fresh air.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.580
Oh, well,
that's cool then.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.680
We thought you were having some
sort of emotional breakdown.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.020
Rigby!
( Grunts )

05:15.120 --> 05:16.500
Pops, you know
we're here for you.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.980
I know.
I'm sorry.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.900
It's just seeing
you all together ââ

05:21.000 --> 05:22.620
all my good friends ââ

05:22.720 --> 05:25.940
If AntiâPops wins tomorrow,
everything will be erased.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.660
And I don't care
what happens to me,

05:27.760 --> 05:29.940
but I don't want
any of you to get hurt.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.820
You're my best friends.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.580
(Sniffles) I don't
normally mix meself up

05:34.680 --> 05:36.300
in the affairs
of the living,

05:36.400 --> 05:39.340
but in the battle tomorrow,
you can count on my help.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.100
Oh, I can't ask you
to do that.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.860
Ridiculous ââ
You're our friend, Pops.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.060
Yes, and leaving you
to face AntiâPops

05:47.160 --> 05:49.620
by yourself would be
totally uncool.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.420
âWe got your back, Pops.
âWe gotcha, bro.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.580
âDon't worry, Pops.
âWe're totally behind you, Pops.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.300
Good show.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.860
Wait, I have an idea.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.960
When I finished high school,
our class buried a time capsule

05:58.880 --> 06:01.260
full of moments for us to dig up
at our 10âyear reunion

06:01.360 --> 06:02.580
to see
what we each put in it.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.680
What if we all put
something personal

06:04.200 --> 06:06.380
in a time capsule
and shot it into space?

06:06.480 --> 06:08.980
That way, no matter
what happens, there will

06:09.080 --> 06:11.860
always be a part of us floating
out there forever.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.540
Mordecai,
that's a splendid idea.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.900
Good show.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.960
Yes! I can totally relate
to wanting to do that

06:18.040 --> 06:19.700
now that
I'm a highâschool graduate.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.800
But what would we
even put in it?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Like, our favorite chips
or something?

06:22.520 --> 06:24.100
I can help with that.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.220
I can copy everyone's memories
of their entire lives,

06:27.320 --> 06:29.220
and put them
on a Bluâray boxâset.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.140
I could do that, too,
if you guys want.

06:31.240 --> 06:34.620
Uh, yeah, but your lives will
look way better on Bluâray.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.720
Yeah, we should just go
with Bluâray.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
âBlue is my favorite color.
âSounds cool.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.680
âAll right.
âShow off.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.300
Hey, Benson, mind helping me
get this thing started?

06:45.400 --> 06:46.700
Uh, sure.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.180
Come on around back here

06:48.280 --> 06:50.220
and pop open that little panel
on my back.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.420
Ooh!

06:51.520 --> 06:52.940
Ever since we got to space,

06:53.040 --> 06:54.860
Benson's been killing it
with the ladies.

06:54.960 --> 06:55.940
( Chuckling ) Yeah.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.620
Uhhmm...

06:57.720 --> 07:00.580
Yep, there ya go.
Almost got it.
( Beep! Warble! )

07:00.680 --> 07:03.540
Oh, there's
so many buttons back here.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.380
Hey, IâI only have
<i>onebutton over here!</i>

07:05.480 --> 07:06.820
You can't miss it!

07:06.920 --> 07:09.320
You guys will need to stay still
once the process starts.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.380
It can be dangerous
and disorienting.

07:11.480 --> 07:15.020
There's lasers involved.
Don't touch the lasers.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.820
( Beep! )
Found it.
Good job, Benson.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.920
I knew you'd find
the button eventually.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.340
( Robotically )
Memory scan commencing.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.220
Now, hold on, guys.
This might hurt a little bit.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.680
Wait, what ââ
( Groans )

07:29.680 --> 07:31.760
Whoa!

07:33.520 --> 07:35.420
We can see everything.

07:35.520 --> 07:38.140
( All exclaim )

07:38.240 --> 07:41.860
Dude, I think most of these
are of Benson yelling.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.060
No, they're not!

07:43.160 --> 07:44.980
Benson: <i>You're fired.</i>
( Growls )

07:45.080 --> 07:47.460
Whoa, remember
when Pops wrestled a bear?

07:47.560 --> 07:48.700
That was awesome.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.420
Good times.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.700
( Laughs )

07:51.800 --> 07:53.740
Bros, are you
not hearing this?

07:53.840 --> 07:56.340
( Laughs )
I'm killing it.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.420
( Laughs )
Hey, Rigby.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.520
Check it out.
âWhat?

08:01.720 --> 08:03.860
( Laughter )
Stop laughing!

08:03.960 --> 08:05.260
Aah!
Don't look at that!

08:05.360 --> 08:07.360
âStop! Rigby!
âRigbey, no, stop!

08:06.440 --> 08:07.660
Aaah!

08:07.760 --> 08:09.220
âRigby!
âWhat's happening?

08:09.320 --> 08:10.540
I can't stop!

08:10.640 --> 08:11.660
Rigby!

08:11.760 --> 08:12.940
Bluâray,
turn off the laser!

08:13.040 --> 08:14.540
Bluâray:
( Echoing ) I can't!

08:14.640 --> 08:16.600
The process won't stop
until it's done recording.

08:16.680 --> 08:20.580
You know, I was <i>veryclear</i>
about not touching <i>anything.</i>

08:20.680 --> 08:22.500
Hold on, Rigby!
( Grunts )

08:22.600 --> 08:24.600
Mordecai,
what are you doing?

08:23.720 --> 08:24.860
( Screams )

08:24.960 --> 08:25.980
Mordecai: ( Grunts )

08:26.080 --> 08:27.380
I gotcha, dude!
( Grunts )

08:27.480 --> 08:29.020
Dude, I'm slipping!
( Both scream )

08:29.120 --> 08:30.180
Guys!

08:30.280 --> 08:31.620
( Both screaming )

08:31.720 --> 08:33.060
Oh, yeah, Eileen!

08:33.160 --> 08:34.780
( All screams )

08:34.880 --> 08:36.540
Come on!

08:36.640 --> 08:37.620
( Whimpers )

08:37.720 --> 08:39.300
Aah! Huh?

08:39.400 --> 08:40.900
( All grunting )

08:41.000 --> 08:44.460
( All scream )

08:44.560 --> 08:45.540
Oh, no!

08:45.640 --> 08:48.260
Aah!

08:48.360 --> 08:50.060
Aw, yeah, Pops!

08:50.160 --> 08:53.380
I don't know
how long I can hold on!

08:53.480 --> 08:56.580
The memories are catching up!
We're almost done, Pops!

08:56.680 --> 08:58.100
Dude, that killer plant
was cool.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.580
( Grunting )

08:59.680 --> 09:01.420
Look ââ
It's us right now.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.220
( Dramatic music plays )

09:04.320 --> 09:05.340
( All grunt )

09:05.440 --> 09:07.820
Whoa!
That was awesome, Pops!

09:07.920 --> 09:09.660
âGood job.
âWow, great job, Pops.

09:09.760 --> 09:13.380
Oh, it's nothing.
Bluâray, did it work?

09:13.480 --> 09:16.180
Recording...

09:16.280 --> 09:17.860
complete.

09:17.960 --> 09:21.500
Everyone's memories saved onto
their own commemorative Bluâray.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.100
Both: Cool.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.460
They've even got
our faces on them.

09:25.560 --> 09:26.820
Pretty neat.

09:26.920 --> 09:29.740
Your entire lives are contained
on these discs.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.620
I also took the liberty
of compiling a few bonus discs.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.260
This disc is
two hours of bloopers.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.940
And this one I call
"Mordecai pulls a 'Mordecai.'"

09:37.040 --> 09:38.060
It's a twoâdisc set.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.220
What do ya think, Pops?

09:39.320 --> 09:40.900
( Sobs )

09:41.000 --> 09:44.020
Don't worry.
These are tears of joy.

09:44.120 --> 09:47.100
Now, no matter what happens,
our friendship

09:47.200 --> 09:51.420
and all of our jolly good times
will never be forgotten.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.740
That's great, Pops.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.640
Now, let's blast those discs
into outer space.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.580
âIn five, four ââ
âWait.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.680
What if the person
who finds the discs

10:02.160 --> 10:03.700
doesn't have
a Bluâray player?

10:03.800 --> 10:06.260
( All speaking indistinctly )

10:06.360 --> 10:07.740
Don't worry.
I've got it.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.580
( Grunting )

10:10.680 --> 10:12.820
( Exhales sharply )

10:12.920 --> 10:14.920
( Metal scraping,
steam hissing )
( Grunting )

10:15.960 --> 10:18.300
Wait, but what if the person
who finds the time capsule

10:18.400 --> 10:19.620
doesn't have
a bigâscreen TV?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.300
I can push one of those out.
( Grunts )

10:21.400 --> 10:23.540
âNo, no.
âThat's all right!

10:23.640 --> 10:25.640
Fire in the hole!

10:31.160 --> 10:33.540
Or we could just bury it
in the park.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.860
( Both laughing )
