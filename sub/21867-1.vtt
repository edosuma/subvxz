00:00.000 --> 00:02.500
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:02.583 --> 00:04.166
You said HYDRA
had a way of convincing people.

00:04.542 --> 00:05.709
You were talking about brainwashing.

00:05.792 --> 00:07.625
Are you ready to comply, Agent 33?

00:07.709 --> 00:09.083
Happy to comply.

00:09.291 --> 00:10.583
S.H.I.E.L.D. is becoming a problem.

00:10.667 --> 00:11.709
Do we know who is in charge?

00:11.792 --> 00:13.000
I'm afraid not.

00:13.083 --> 00:14.125
How about we make a deal?

00:14.208 --> 00:16.291
S.H.I.E.L.D. will keep dropping off
presents like this.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.417
All we ask for in return
is a little breathing room.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.375
Sorry,
I'm gonna have to say no to that deal.

00:20.458 --> 00:22.250
Since Simmons left,
he's only getting worse.

00:22.458 --> 00:23.542
He's grown isolated.

00:23.625 --> 00:24.542
Who are you talking to?

00:24.625 --> 00:25.750
-What? No one.
-Me.

00:25.834 --> 00:27.166
You like talking to yourself. It's cool.

00:27.250 --> 00:29.125
- What do you want, Raina?
- It's what I don't want.

00:29.208 --> 00:30.917
Which is the Obelisk
falling into the hands of people

00:31.000 --> 00:31.959
who don't understand it.

00:32.041 --> 00:33.417
I know he's keeping something from me.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.625
And it's not just because
he's the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:35.709 --> 00:37.750
It's been 18 days since your last episode.

00:37.834 --> 00:38.875
And I'm tired of fighting it.

00:38.959 --> 00:40.125
That's why I'm here.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.792
I think
something is wrong with him.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.166
Is Coulson OK?

01:05.291 --> 01:07.709
Your Grace, thank you for coming.

01:07.792 --> 01:10.709
Our parishioners are still trying
to understand this tragedy, and...

01:10.792 --> 01:12.000
Show it to me.

01:13.041 --> 01:15.458
Of course. This way, please.

01:27.375 --> 01:28.208
Here.

01:30.583 --> 01:33.375
It dates back to Spain, the early 1500s.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.792
It was the only item
in our entire church that was spared.

01:37.083 --> 01:38.041
It's a miracle.

01:38.875 --> 01:40.333
One which might help us rebuild.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.583
Experts will have to verify it, of course.

01:43.709 --> 01:47.125
Your Grace, shouldn't it be enough
simply to believe in the miracle?

01:47.208 --> 01:48.375
Does it have to be proven?

01:49.291 --> 01:50.417
Faith is enough for us.

01:51.125 --> 01:53.917
But the rest of the world,
they'll need something more tangible.

01:56.041 --> 01:57.625
Why? Do you have some reservation?

01:59.083 --> 02:00.417
There is one more thing.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.625
I should really be
getting ready for the party.

02:25.875 --> 02:28.250
Besides, I thought you said
you wanted time in the ocean.

02:28.333 --> 02:30.542
Well, I've seen it. Fish, waves, whatever.

02:30.959 --> 02:32.792
I found something far more captivating.

02:53.208 --> 02:55.250
The rabbit's in the hutch. I'm on my way.

03:07.875 --> 03:09.041
I think we'll make it.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.959
Hunter did a good job

03:11.041 --> 03:13.959
distracting Gabriel,
Soto's executive assistant.

03:14.250 --> 03:15.583
Oh, I bet he did.

03:16.166 --> 03:18.125
Damn, tickets cost $25,000?

03:18.208 --> 03:20.917
Each. That's why I'm going
for the five-finger discount.

03:21.792 --> 03:23.000
Mack, you're on.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.417
Copy that. We're pulling up now.

03:38.834 --> 03:39.792
Thank you.

03:40.417 --> 03:42.041
Sir, notice the car?

03:42.333 --> 03:44.625
1962 Rolls. Restored it myself.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.709
I noticed. Still not letting
you work on Lola.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.333
In time, sir. In time.

03:54.625 --> 03:58.000
This is fun, right?
Isn't this fun? Look, cufflinks.

03:58.083 --> 04:00.959
I will pay you $500 right now
for a pair of flats.

04:02.417 --> 04:03.667
Good luck, sir.

04:14.041 --> 04:15.500
- Identification, please.
- Of course.

04:15.583 --> 04:16.959
-Charles, you've got mine, right?
-Yes.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.333
I like making him carry my things.
Gives him purpose.

04:20.667 --> 04:22.709
Plus, that way I know
she can't take off without me.

04:22.792 --> 04:25.417
Oh, well, you never know when
a better offer might come along, right?

04:30.792 --> 04:31.667
Enjoy the party.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.458
Thank you. Darling.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.041
Good work on the cover, Skye. We're in.

04:37.125 --> 04:39.709
OK. Remember,
Soto has the painting in a sublevel

04:39.792 --> 04:42.041
storage room until it comes out
later tonight for the guests.

04:42.125 --> 04:43.500
How heavy is the security?

04:43.583 --> 04:45.250
Still assessing. Let's assume very.

04:45.333 --> 04:48.000
Keep in mind, we've got
diplomats here, state officials.

04:48.083 --> 04:49.834
These are not friends of S.H.I.E.L.D.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.750
Bridget said Soto's sending out
the painting for verification

04:52.875 --> 04:53.709
first thing in the morning.

04:54.125 --> 04:56.750
She, uh, whispered
it in my ear, if you know what I mean.

04:56.834 --> 04:58.875
Yes, everybody
on the planet knows what you mean, Hunter.

04:58.959 --> 04:59.792
Let's focus.

04:59.875 --> 05:02.834
Right. So, upshot is tonight's
our one chance to steal this thing.

05:02.917 --> 05:04.834
Director, are you sure
you don't want me there?

05:04.917 --> 05:06.000
I can help you and May get around

05:06.083 --> 05:07.834
any security measures Soto has in...

05:07.917 --> 05:09.792
No, keeping it to two agents allows us

05:09.875 --> 05:11.875
to minimize detection in a small space.

05:11.959 --> 05:14.417
I hope you don't need me to explain
covert operations again.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.709
- No, sir.
- Good.

05:15.792 --> 05:18.166
This writing was in Garrett's lab,
the Obelisk,

05:18.250 --> 05:20.250
and now a 500-year-old piece of art.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.792
It's important. Getting that painting
could mean answers for us.

05:24.041 --> 05:25.041
Yes, sir. We will...

05:27.625 --> 05:28.834
Wait, what was that?

05:30.500 --> 05:31.375
Yeah, that's May.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.625
Is she OK? Is everything OK?

05:36.250 --> 05:37.750
Yes. She's laughing.

05:37.834 --> 05:39.750
I think the worst of it's over now.

05:40.667 --> 05:41.667
Excuse me.

05:47.333 --> 05:48.333
My face hurts.

05:48.917 --> 05:49.875
Come on.

05:50.208 --> 05:52.625
We got a cover to maintain
and some details to go over.

05:53.458 --> 05:54.667
Going radio silent.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.458
We'll resume contact shortly.

05:58.583 --> 06:00.208
Did they just turn off their comms?

06:19.917 --> 06:21.208
Well, hey, look at that.

06:22.250 --> 06:23.667
You still remember the steps.

06:24.125 --> 06:25.125
Impressive.

06:28.667 --> 06:31.250
My 10 o'clock,
security chief standing watch.

06:33.041 --> 06:34.625
Dance elective at the Academy.

06:36.333 --> 06:38.041
Of course, I dropped it two weeks later.

06:42.792 --> 06:44.375
Dome camera at three o'clock.

06:46.750 --> 06:50.291
I count seven uniforms.
Walkie, sidearm, baton.

06:50.458 --> 06:53.542
I just wanted to graduate
so I could get actual field assignments.

06:54.291 --> 06:55.834
-What?
-You weren't exactly thrilled

06:55.917 --> 06:58.333
when we got assigned
that retrieval op in Sausalito.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.792
That coffee shop? Our first mission?

07:00.875 --> 07:03.792
That's because the commander
sent us in with no exit plan.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.041
I was in the Bay for five hours.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.875
I fished you out. Eventually.

07:09.667 --> 07:12.667
Come on, we used to have fun
like this in our youth.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.291
You know you enjoyed it.

07:14.375 --> 07:15.625
Yes.

07:16.125 --> 07:17.250
Then life happened.

07:17.917 --> 07:20.625
Nostalgia's fine,
but I'd rather deal with reality.

07:21.834 --> 07:23.792
You planning to talk to me
about your hand?

07:24.709 --> 07:25.875
What about it?

07:26.500 --> 07:28.792
You think I didn't see it tremoring
the whole flight out?

07:29.375 --> 07:30.875
Your symptoms are getting worse.

07:31.834 --> 07:33.041
Did the rest of the team see it?

07:33.125 --> 07:35.083
No. They're good.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.583
Skye's asking the usual
too many questions.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.083
They think it's a standard op.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.542
Don't know it's personal.

07:40.625 --> 07:41.458
OK.

07:43.875 --> 07:44.834
Phil,

07:45.583 --> 07:47.417
if I think this mission
is too much for you,

07:47.500 --> 07:48.417
I'll pull the plug.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.417
Yes, fine. I understand.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.083
But that's not why I turned off the comms.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.750
I know you don't wanna talk about this,

07:55.834 --> 07:58.625
but we need to make
a plan in case I go the way of Garrett.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.709
You're right.
I don't wanna talk about this.

08:01.792 --> 08:03.291
We both know how this could end.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.500
-Phil?
-I know it's uncomfortable,

08:05.583 --> 08:06.667
but it's also necessary.

08:06.750 --> 08:08.041
No, Phil, look.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.625
Talbot.

08:11.583 --> 08:12.917
There goes our cover.

08:29.667 --> 08:30.750
Well, hey there, General.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.417
Fancy meeting you here.

08:33.750 --> 08:34.792
Hey, yourself.

08:36.000 --> 08:36.875
Good to see you.

08:37.792 --> 08:38.875
I'm glad to hear that.

08:39.667 --> 08:43.041
Isn't everything nicer now that we've
put all our differences behind us?

08:44.458 --> 08:45.458
Absolutely.

08:47.875 --> 08:48.959
How many of those have you had?

08:49.750 --> 08:52.250
One too many. Don't tell.

08:53.458 --> 08:56.500
It'll be our secret.
As long as you keep mine.

08:56.583 --> 08:58.792
That doesn't sound like a fair trade.

08:59.834 --> 09:03.750
Look, I appreciate
you not blowing my cover. Yet.

09:03.834 --> 09:08.083
Let's just say, hypothetically, you don't,
this mission will benefit both of us.

09:09.208 --> 09:10.750
Benefit us hypothetically?

09:12.250 --> 09:15.250
Your division has benefited plenty
from my assistance.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.709
Actually, your career, too.

09:18.250 --> 09:19.083
Sure.

09:20.041 --> 09:22.917
So, I'm gonna keep moving
forward with my operation.

09:23.583 --> 09:26.333
I hope I don't have to worry
about interference.

09:28.125 --> 09:29.208
I won't interfere.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.792
Unless I feel I need to.

09:38.959 --> 09:41.709
Nice work out there.
Do we get to keep the scooter?

09:41.875 --> 09:42.750
Nice work yourself,

09:42.834 --> 09:44.583
though it didn't look like
you were suffering too much.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.875
And I was babysitting an empty plane.
How is this fair?

09:48.208 --> 09:52.000
It's weird, women just like me.
Always have.

09:52.417 --> 09:55.417
Never understood it.
Must be a magnetism thing, I guess.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.750
Who can explain it, eh?

09:56.875 --> 09:58.875
If it makes you
feel any better, I don't get it either.

09:59.041 --> 09:59.959
You hear that?

10:00.041 --> 10:02.417
If I wanted someone
to take jabs at me, I'd still be married.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.959
Hmm. Jeez, not this
story again. Can we not?

10:05.041 --> 10:06.208
Oh, no, I think we can.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.709
I first met her on a spring night.

10:09.125 --> 10:10.792
She was on the pier
facing the Outer Banks,

10:11.208 --> 10:13.000
the moonlight glinting off her face.

10:13.083 --> 10:13.917
Mmm-hmm.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.583
She resembled a goddess.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.375
Of course, that was her cruel trick.

10:17.834 --> 10:18.709
Hey, guys?

10:18.792 --> 10:20.083
Best timing ever.

10:20.375 --> 10:22.375
Oh. Decided to come back online, did we?

10:22.542 --> 10:23.417
Talbot's here.

10:23.917 --> 10:24.750
"Talbot" Talbot?

10:24.834 --> 10:26.625
- What the hell is he doing there?
- No idea.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.542
All that matters is our cover's at risk,
so I'm calling an audible.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.709
We're not gonna wait till later
to get the painting.

10:31.792 --> 10:32.709
We're gonna get it now.

10:33.375 --> 10:34.291
I'll take point.

10:34.959 --> 10:36.625
Well, I just think it's so admirable

10:36.709 --> 10:39.000
what you're doing for that poor church
that burned down.

10:39.750 --> 10:42.125
I should be thanking you
for your generous patronage.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.875
You know, Santa Maria de Las Flores
was my second home.

10:44.959 --> 10:45.834
Oh.

10:45.917 --> 10:48.959
Though I'm really surprised that
you and I have never met before.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.583
I would've remembered you.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.667
Well, I bet letting people see
the miracle painting in person

10:54.750 --> 10:57.542
is bringing out all kinds of donors
that you haven't met before.

10:58.208 --> 11:00.083
But just remember, I'm here for the cause.

11:00.917 --> 11:02.417
Well, the cause and the company.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.667
I like to hear that.

11:03.792 --> 11:06.542
She just said more words than
I've heard her say in a year.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.208
I just have to say,
philanthropy is my passion.

11:09.291 --> 11:10.959
All right, Agent May.

11:11.417 --> 11:12.625
That's very alarming.

11:12.709 --> 11:14.208
I'm all about giving.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.709
I must get a picture of us together.

11:27.125 --> 11:28.709
Charles? Come here.

11:29.709 --> 11:31.834
Honey, can you take
a picture of me and Mr. Soto?

11:31.917 --> 11:33.542
It'll be such a nice
memento of the evening.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.000
Oh, yes, that would be nice.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.542
He's your husband?

11:36.625 --> 11:38.250
We're modern. Charles, please?

11:38.333 --> 11:39.291
Hang on, Heidi.

11:39.375 --> 11:41.125
Just trying to find the flash.

11:42.542 --> 11:44.417
Honestly, this happens every time.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.542
How hard could it be?
They sell these phones to children!

11:47.625 --> 11:48.583
OK.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.083
Excuse me,
I should go see about my other guests...

11:50.166 --> 11:51.750
Oh, no, no, no, please.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.166
Yes, yes, yes, one moment.

11:55.166 --> 11:56.041
And there we go!

11:57.083 --> 11:58.083
Those two...

11:58.166 --> 11:59.834
- Well, it was just...
- Wasn't it just?

11:59.917 --> 12:01.750
-Hmm?
-Mr. Soto, thank you so much.

12:01.959 --> 12:04.083
Lovely party. Goodbye! Come on, dear.

12:04.166 --> 12:05.500
-We're blown.
-Why?

12:05.583 --> 12:08.458
No idea. Maybe Talbot's still pissed
'cause we kidnapped him that time.

12:08.542 --> 12:10.458
- We need to do this now.
- Oh, yeah.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.291
Yo.

12:16.792 --> 12:17.875
I could've handled him.

12:17.959 --> 12:18.875
I did.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.709
They're gonna be onto us soon.

12:26.792 --> 12:27.959
I know. Almost there.

12:41.333 --> 12:42.709
I really like that dress.

12:45.834 --> 12:47.333
Sublevel storage room.
Straight ahead.

12:47.417 --> 12:49.000
- Painting's there.
- Great.

12:49.083 --> 12:50.375
This isn't the op we anticipated.

12:50.458 --> 12:52.542
Everything's gonna be a little more fast
and dirty than we planned.

12:52.625 --> 12:54.166
Only makes it more interesting.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.291
See? The exuberance of youth.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.875
- Guys, wait, you're about to hit...
- Laser grids.

12:59.834 --> 13:01.625
Why is it always laser grids?

13:02.333 --> 13:03.542
Guy's not kidding around.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.625
All right. I got this.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.250
They already know we're here.

13:14.917 --> 13:15.959
Oh, yeah.

13:32.917 --> 13:34.208
There's no painting here!

13:34.709 --> 13:37.125
Could be a mistake. Another room, maybe?

13:37.583 --> 13:38.834
No, it's not a mistake.

13:38.917 --> 13:41.750
A record of appropriation
just popped up on the church's books.

13:41.834 --> 13:43.542
Don't tell me. The U.S. government.

13:43.667 --> 13:46.083
Talbot took possession of the painting
from the church this morning.

13:46.166 --> 13:49.250
"Related to an ongoing
government investigation," it says.

13:49.333 --> 13:52.333
Why is he even on this?
How does he know about that painting?

13:52.417 --> 13:54.041
-We need to...
-We need to go.

13:56.875 --> 13:59.083
Yes, I've got it.
There was one problem though.

13:59.417 --> 14:00.417
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s here.

14:01.000 --> 14:01.834
Look.

14:03.709 --> 14:04.750
Recognize them?

14:09.458 --> 14:10.625
Fascinating.

14:11.291 --> 14:13.834
They weren't any trouble.
You want me to come in?

14:17.417 --> 14:18.250
No.

14:18.792 --> 14:19.959
I have a new plan.

14:23.375 --> 14:24.709
Search the storage area!

14:29.917 --> 14:31.625
I assume this all makes you happy.

14:32.166 --> 14:33.458
Why would this make me happy?

14:33.750 --> 14:36.000
We failed in our mission,
we're outnumbered, trapped,

14:36.083 --> 14:37.291
hoping not to get killed.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.834
Feels like the old days to me.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.500
Yeah, I guess Talbot took this round.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.208
I'm not giving up yet.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.208
No. You always have my back.

14:46.959 --> 14:49.166
Speaking of, when we get out of this,

14:49.250 --> 14:51.583
we're having a real conversation
about a contingency plan.

14:51.667 --> 14:52.792
You can't avoid it anymore.

14:52.875 --> 14:53.834
We're clear.

15:04.792 --> 15:05.959
Agent Coulson!

15:06.875 --> 15:07.917
Agent May.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.792
You seem like you're in a hurry.

15:11.709 --> 15:13.625
The caterers ran out of coconut shrimp.

15:13.875 --> 15:14.917
No reason to stay.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.375
You see, I was worried you left

15:18.458 --> 15:21.542
because I got my hands on
the miracle painting and you didn't.

15:23.750 --> 15:24.750
Come on, Coulson.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.208
It's obvious we were there
for the same thing.

15:27.875 --> 15:29.959
- Now I've been thinking...
- I'm sure.

15:30.041 --> 15:32.583
I know there's writing
on the back of that painting.

15:32.959 --> 15:35.500
The government wouldn't
have sent me down here if we didn't.

15:37.417 --> 15:40.125
Phil, you're the only one
that can help me figure out

15:40.208 --> 15:41.792
what that writing is.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.000
It's what you do.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.125
So why don't we help each other?

15:46.041 --> 15:47.291
Why would I help you?

15:47.709 --> 15:49.166
You came all the way down here.

15:49.250 --> 15:50.917
I gotta believe you wanna know
what that writing means

15:51.000 --> 15:52.625
just as badly as we do.

15:52.709 --> 15:53.709
Yeah?

15:53.959 --> 15:55.709
Why do I have a feeling there's a catch?

15:55.834 --> 15:56.834
There's no catch.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.792
You'll have to examine it in
a secure military facility,

16:00.375 --> 16:02.291
where I can keep an eye on you,
but that's just

16:03.792 --> 16:04.792
regulation.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.500
OK. You got a deal.

16:09.166 --> 16:10.208
Excellent.

16:10.291 --> 16:13.208
Just let me check in with my team.
I need to give them their orders.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.041
You know,
they'll get nervous if I just disappear.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.333
What do you need, about an hour?

16:17.625 --> 16:18.500
That ought to do it.

16:18.583 --> 16:21.041
I'm downtown at the Hotel La Ona.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.917
-I'll see you there.
-I look forward to it.

16:31.709 --> 16:33.500
A change of heart? Doesn't add up.

16:33.667 --> 16:36.291
No, he's working us.
I just need to know why.

16:36.375 --> 16:38.500
- I'll handle it.
- May.

16:38.583 --> 16:42.250
Hey, this is the part I do.
It'll make up for all the dancing.

16:42.417 --> 16:43.917
-You liked it.
-No, I didn't.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.083
Little bit?

16:45.375 --> 16:46.250
A little bit.

16:46.583 --> 16:48.041
Check in as soon as you know something.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.417
And if something goes wrong...

16:49.500 --> 16:50.542
I'll handle it.

17:05.417 --> 17:08.417
Don't remember Coulson asking you
to do extra research on this thing.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.750
I'm being industrious.

17:09.834 --> 17:12.375
Or are you digging into
a top-secret mission

17:12.458 --> 17:14.709
to find out about the parts
they're not telling us?

17:14.792 --> 17:17.083
I am a good, helpful soldier.

17:18.792 --> 17:21.000
Well, I happen to appreciate
your instinct to be thorough.

17:21.083 --> 17:24.542
I myself prefer a pint and a good nap.
But then, I'm the lazy type.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.250
"Lazy" is not the first word
that comes to mind.

17:26.333 --> 17:27.959
-"Dangerous"? I understand.
-Mmm-mmm.

17:28.041 --> 17:30.917
But truly, it should be "lazy."
I just hide it well.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.542
Think that's what drove away the ex-wife?

17:33.375 --> 17:34.959
See, now you're bringing it back up.

17:35.083 --> 17:36.333
Ha-ha, and no,

17:36.417 --> 17:39.417
it didn't work out because
interspecies relationships are hard.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.875
I was a human,
whereas she was a demonic hell-beast.

17:41.959 --> 17:42.792
He doesn't like her.

17:42.875 --> 17:43.875
You don't say.

17:43.959 --> 17:44.875
She's pure evil.

17:44.959 --> 17:46.333
Hey, at least you got away from your ex.

17:46.417 --> 17:49.375
The guy I had a crush on is now
the psycho living in our basement.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.458
You know, I wish I could relate,
but all my exes are awesome.

17:52.542 --> 17:55.041
Is that right?
I seem to remember an entire year

17:55.125 --> 17:56.792
where you had to pretend you liked quinoa.

17:57.834 --> 17:59.959
Yeah. That was a dark time.

18:03.792 --> 18:06.166
The point is, exes are
like stones around your neck.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.375
-They weigh you down.
-Fitz.

18:07.458 --> 18:09.834
Go join them. They're bonding.
You'll be left out.

18:51.583 --> 18:52.875
What have you done with Talbot?

18:54.083 --> 18:55.250
I'm right here.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.625
So that's Agent May.

19:15.709 --> 19:17.458
I guess the file wasn't overselling her.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.625
If Coulson sent her, it would seem
he doesn't fully trust General Talbot.

19:21.792 --> 19:22.625
So, what now?

19:22.709 --> 19:24.375
We have Dr. Whitehall's mission
to complete.

19:25.041 --> 19:27.500
We need to send in someone
Agent Coulson does trust.

19:49.834 --> 19:50.667
Yeah?

19:50.750 --> 19:52.500
Why do I have a feeling there's a catch?

19:53.083 --> 19:54.291
Yeah?

19:54.792 --> 19:56.500
Why do I have a feeling there's a catch?

20:23.333 --> 20:24.333
How do I look?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.583
Just get Coulson back here.
I'll take it from that point.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.417
This should help you
neutralize Coulson's team.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.250
May? You all right?

20:53.333 --> 20:55.458
I'm fine. I checked on Talbot.

20:55.667 --> 20:56.542
The offer seems solid,

20:56.625 --> 20:58.750
but I think he's keeping it
from his superiors,

20:58.834 --> 21:00.583
so we don't have a lot of time.

21:00.959 --> 21:03.000
I'm coming back to get you. Be ready.

21:03.750 --> 21:05.667
Copy that.
See you when I see you.

21:08.083 --> 21:09.667
Got his location.

21:10.166 --> 21:11.000
Go.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.667
Do you really think
running away is the answer?

21:35.375 --> 21:37.458
I'm not running away.
I wanted to be alone.

21:37.542 --> 21:39.333
Nonsense. You hate being alone.

21:39.542 --> 21:40.917
As evidenced by you.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.834
You're avoiding something.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.917
Talking. They're just talking.
And I'm having trouble with that lately.

21:47.542 --> 21:49.000
You're doing fine talking to me.

21:49.333 --> 21:53.250
Yes. But I think you're ignoring
a rather significant elephant in the room.

21:54.208 --> 21:56.000
You're not afraid to talk.

21:56.166 --> 21:57.959
You're afraid you'll have nothing to say.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.834
Just tell them what you're thinking,
how you're feeling.

22:00.917 --> 22:03.375
Yeah, 'cause that's worked out
so well for me in the past.

22:07.709 --> 22:11.166
Besides, don't even have
anything in common with that lot.

22:11.250 --> 22:12.417
Not anymore.

22:12.959 --> 22:16.250
I'm not even a part of...

22:16.333 --> 22:17.458
The team?

22:18.458 --> 22:19.792
Mmm-hmm.

22:20.125 --> 22:21.166
Of course you are.

22:21.625 --> 22:23.000
Or you could be,

22:23.291 --> 22:26.709
if you'd just engage with them
instead of hiding out here in the garage.

22:26.792 --> 22:28.333
Yeah, well, it's not
supposed to be a garage.

22:28.417 --> 22:30.000
It's supposed to be our lab.

22:30.125 --> 22:32.583
Our place.

22:32.667 --> 22:35.125
But they changed it.
Didn't even ask me, just did it.

22:35.208 --> 22:38.000
The new lab is beautiful.
It's bigger, it's got more...

22:38.083 --> 22:39.375
Yes, but it's not ours!

22:39.750 --> 22:42.375
And they didn't ask me because
they don't care what I have to say.

22:42.458 --> 22:44.667
-Fitz...
-Even Ward's more valuable than me.

22:45.375 --> 22:48.583
And he's perfectly able to speak
in complete sentences.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.500
You should've heard the excuses
he had for what he did to us.

22:51.583 --> 22:52.625
Listen.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.875
You may be stumbling and stuttering
on the outside,

22:58.250 --> 23:00.750
but you have to let them see
who you really are.

23:01.166 --> 23:02.375
Underneath all that.

23:03.083 --> 23:04.083
Where's Coulson?

23:05.625 --> 23:06.542
Upstairs.

23:10.542 --> 23:11.750
I don't know
what he was doing there.

23:11.834 --> 23:12.959
I don't know how...

23:13.041 --> 23:14.500
May, we were just figuring out
whether or not we should...

23:14.583 --> 23:15.542
Good. Coulson.

23:23.333 --> 23:24.959
So Talbot was being honest?

23:25.041 --> 23:26.792
Surprised the hell out of me,
too, trust me.

23:26.875 --> 23:28.333
It looks like he wants to work with you.

23:28.417 --> 23:29.500
Wow.

23:29.834 --> 23:31.250
Maybe we are getting through to him.

23:31.333 --> 23:32.667
He only wants to meet with you.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.750
But you know I'm not gonna
let you go out there alone.

23:34.834 --> 23:36.125
Great. Let's move.

23:56.583 --> 23:58.083
Welcome back, Agent May.

23:59.208 --> 24:01.041
I have a few questions for you.

24:01.125 --> 24:05.166
For example, why your sudden interest
in religious artwork?

24:05.250 --> 24:06.750
Everybody has a hobby.

24:08.125 --> 24:10.500
You and your small band
of S.H.I.E.L.D. compatriots,

24:10.917 --> 24:12.625
there can't be many of you left.

24:12.709 --> 24:14.166
Who's running your operation?

24:16.083 --> 24:18.000
Where are you based?

24:18.542 --> 24:19.667
Currently?

24:20.083 --> 24:21.917
About five feet from kicking your ass.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.208
Ha.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.583
I don't much
believe in empty threats, Agent May.

24:28.875 --> 24:30.125
I prefer promises.

24:31.500 --> 24:32.542
Such as this.

24:34.166 --> 24:36.333
You will tell me what I want to know.

24:37.208 --> 24:38.875
You have no idea what you're starting.

24:38.959 --> 24:39.875
Perhaps.

24:41.333 --> 24:42.667
But I serve a man

24:42.750 --> 24:46.000
who has an effective way of getting
the information he wants.

24:46.834 --> 24:48.125
You will meet him soon.

24:49.041 --> 24:51.250
And you will comply.

24:52.750 --> 24:54.041
Until then...

25:00.583 --> 25:02.125
...I'll improvise.

25:08.250 --> 25:10.417
So, the plan.

25:11.125 --> 25:13.792
Shouldn't be hard.
Talk to Talbot, see what he has to say.

25:13.875 --> 25:17.583
No. Not that plan. The other plan.

25:19.417 --> 25:21.542
OK, the other plan. Yeah.

25:21.792 --> 25:23.000
Look, I don't like having to wait until

25:23.083 --> 25:27.041
we're trapped in a car to talk about this,
but you haven't left me much choice.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.500
I guess I didn't, no.

25:29.625 --> 25:31.750
I just need to know that
if things get bad with me,

25:31.834 --> 25:33.125
you can do what has to be done.

25:34.250 --> 25:35.125
Can you?

25:38.625 --> 25:39.625
I'm sure I can.

25:40.291 --> 25:44.041
It's not just taking me out, May.
The hard part is what happens after.

25:45.083 --> 25:46.417
S.H.I.E.L.D. will need leadership.

25:47.041 --> 25:48.041
A new director.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.583
I trust you,

25:51.458 --> 25:53.250
just you, to do this.

25:54.500 --> 25:55.458
Do you understand?

26:00.125 --> 26:01.166
I understand.

26:03.458 --> 26:04.458
Thank you.

26:06.417 --> 26:07.500
I won't let you down.

26:18.458 --> 26:19.291
Go.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.041
Join them.

26:21.792 --> 26:22.625
Fitz.

26:23.500 --> 26:24.917
You won't even talk to me now.

26:25.041 --> 26:26.792
- Because it's embarrassing.
- Oh, Fitz.

26:30.792 --> 26:32.041
Well, that's an odd sound.

26:34.458 --> 26:35.458
The bus is shutting down.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.083
You know what that means.

26:37.166 --> 26:38.208
We're in trouble.

26:39.291 --> 26:40.792
The cargo hold ramp just went up.

26:41.041 --> 26:42.959
The emergency exits are locking
all over the plane.

26:43.041 --> 26:45.458
It's the equalization
stabilizers, they're fried.

26:45.542 --> 26:47.542
The bus thinks we made
a water landing. We're sealed in.

26:47.625 --> 26:49.291
-There's no way out.
-Well, who's doing this?

26:49.417 --> 26:50.625
We're the only ones on the bus.

26:50.709 --> 26:52.709
This is all happening automatically.

26:52.792 --> 26:53.667
How?

26:53.750 --> 26:55.625
Uh... I think I know.

26:58.125 --> 27:00.750
Somebody... We... We've been...

27:00.834 --> 27:02.166
- Sabotaged.
- Yeah.

27:02.250 --> 27:05.000
This is based on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s... Tech.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.834
It means that the plane is...

27:07.834 --> 27:08.750
The plane will...

27:12.208 --> 27:13.041
That.

27:13.667 --> 27:15.000
The plane will explode?

27:15.625 --> 27:16.542
Soon.

27:19.709 --> 27:22.583
Hopefully, this isn't some kind of trap
Talbot's set for us.

27:22.792 --> 27:24.083
If it is, you've got me here.

27:24.166 --> 27:25.000
Yeah.

27:25.333 --> 27:27.083
It's been nice
working together again, hasn't it?

27:27.667 --> 27:28.667
Yeah.

27:28.750 --> 27:31.041
Just you and me. Like the old days.

27:31.208 --> 27:32.208
It's been great.

27:32.458 --> 27:33.333
You know,

27:35.333 --> 27:37.583
all this nostalgic talk has me thinking.

27:38.542 --> 27:41.625
Maybe this will sound weird,
but how 'bout when this is over,

27:41.709 --> 27:43.542
you and I finally
go get that cup of coffee

27:43.625 --> 27:45.375
we were supposed to get
all those years back?

27:48.500 --> 27:52.625
I thought you'd never ask.
Once this is over, I'd like that.

27:58.417 --> 27:59.667
May hates coffee.

28:24.208 --> 28:28.083
See? So it's like a small disease.

28:28.166 --> 28:29.333
-Virus?
-Virus, yes.

28:29.417 --> 28:30.625
And it's going through...

28:30.834 --> 28:31.917
Through the plane's electrical systems?

28:32.000 --> 28:33.208
Yeah, blowing things up.

28:34.250 --> 28:36.125
The stabilizers, the monitors...

28:36.208 --> 28:37.959
Yes, and the next one would be the...

28:38.041 --> 28:39.083
Nav systems just blew.

28:39.166 --> 28:40.834
- There you go.
- I can't take off.

28:40.917 --> 28:43.625
Wait, wait, wait.
Stabilizers, monitors, nav system.

28:43.709 --> 28:46.041
Comms are next, and then next comes...

28:46.125 --> 28:47.917
The wings! The wings.

28:48.875 --> 28:51.333
Where the fuel is. So then we'll...

29:07.458 --> 29:08.417
I lied.

29:08.542 --> 29:11.667
Working with you,
whoever you are, not that fun.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.792
I won't go down easy.

29:23.917 --> 29:25.500
That makes two of us.

29:36.667 --> 29:38.667
I can't believe I'm the only one
seeing this right now.

29:41.959 --> 29:43.166
He's got the painting. You good?

29:43.709 --> 29:44.542
I'm good.

30:08.500 --> 30:09.583
I thought you said you could do this!

30:09.667 --> 30:11.750
Yes, I can. Or, I mean, I know how.

30:12.875 --> 30:17.458
It's not just words,
it's the hands, controlling them.

30:17.542 --> 30:19.500
So I can't use these. I have to use yours.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.375
Why does it have to be me?
Wouldn't one of the other people...

30:21.458 --> 30:22.458
Yeah, because they're repairing
the systems

30:22.542 --> 30:24.417
that have already gone boom.

30:24.625 --> 30:27.583
To delay the virus.
And you're the only one without...

30:27.667 --> 30:29.041
Any technical skills whatsoever?

30:29.125 --> 30:31.417
-Yes!
-Super. Just tell me what to do.

30:31.834 --> 30:33.500
No, I need reinforcements now.

30:33.583 --> 30:36.125
Send them to my location,
and have an extraction team ready!

30:50.875 --> 30:53.875
I know all your moves. I was S.H.I.E.L.D.

30:55.166 --> 30:56.166
Not all of them.

31:00.125 --> 31:03.917
OK, this chip needs to go
in this empty space.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.291
-All right, this slot, here? OK.
-Yes.

31:07.166 --> 31:08.625
Is that it? Is the plane fixed now?

31:08.709 --> 31:10.375
No! The... We have to do the wires.

31:57.959 --> 31:58.792
This one here?

31:58.875 --> 32:01.917
No, no! Dear God, no.
The one beside it, the one beside it.

32:02.125 --> 32:03.000
-To the left?
-To the right.

32:03.083 --> 32:04.709
To the right. To the...

32:06.166 --> 32:07.542
I think that's a good thing.

32:11.834 --> 32:14.000
And now, the plane is fixed.

32:15.458 --> 32:16.500
Oh.

32:23.083 --> 32:25.291
Mr. Bakshi,
the team is two minutes out, sir.

32:25.959 --> 32:27.709
Sir? Do you copy?

32:40.250 --> 32:44.083
Agent May, surrender
and you will find satisfaction.

32:44.166 --> 32:46.250
I get my satisfaction elsewhere.

32:46.667 --> 32:50.291
The best part about killing you is that
I won't have to be you anymore.

32:50.834 --> 32:51.792
If you were really me,

32:53.083 --> 32:54.208
you wouldn't talk so much.

33:03.208 --> 33:04.208
We gotta go.

33:32.709 --> 33:33.583
Want some help with that?

33:34.083 --> 33:35.125
No, thank you.

33:35.792 --> 33:37.625
Need to learn to do these things
by myself.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.500
Guys, drop everything.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.834
No, this is worth a fortune.
I'm not gonna drop it.

33:43.625 --> 33:45.500
Just put it down.

33:47.667 --> 33:48.542
What's all this?

33:48.625 --> 33:51.041
We survived a HYDRA attack,
saved the bus.

33:51.125 --> 33:53.250
I turned out to be
a genius at mechanical engineering.

33:53.333 --> 33:54.709
Calls for a celebration.

33:54.792 --> 33:55.667
I like the way you think.

33:56.208 --> 33:58.333
Um... No, actually,
I should probably just...

33:58.417 --> 34:01.041
Fitz, this team wouldn't be here
if it weren't for you. This is big.

34:01.125 --> 34:02.750
Let me buy you a beer, mate.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.709
We haven't gotten to work together
much yet,

34:16.792 --> 34:19.291
but I thought
this was a successful mission,

34:19.375 --> 34:20.792
and if we keep up with this teamwork,

34:20.875 --> 34:22.208
there'll be more successful missions,

34:22.458 --> 34:24.041
and plenty more beer, plenty more of...

34:24.125 --> 34:26.542
Yeah, hey, so, um, I don't have an ex.

34:26.625 --> 34:29.333
But there was this girl that I like,
and I told her how I felt,

34:29.417 --> 34:31.917
but she doesn't feel
the same way as I do, so she left.

34:42.417 --> 34:44.500
Her loss then, mate.
From what I can see, she's missing out.

34:46.917 --> 34:47.834
To moving on.

34:51.417 --> 34:53.000
Yeah. Moving on.

35:02.208 --> 35:03.417
Still digging?

35:03.500 --> 35:04.375
What are you doing?

35:04.875 --> 35:06.291
- Nothing.
- Yeah.

35:06.375 --> 35:07.542
Nothing?

35:09.083 --> 35:10.000
Nothing.

35:12.333 --> 35:15.125
OK. Well, if you need
any help with the nothing,

35:15.291 --> 35:16.959
you just let me know, OK?

35:24.667 --> 35:25.917
I did what now?

35:26.333 --> 35:28.458
I know. It's a lot to process.

35:28.542 --> 35:30.500
I mean, a painting, Coulson?

35:30.583 --> 35:33.000
And you weren't immediately
suspicious it wasn't me?

35:33.500 --> 35:35.583
To be fair, we're not that close.

35:35.917 --> 35:39.834
Yeah. Well, if this is, indeed,
as important as you say it is,

35:39.917 --> 35:41.417
you should probably hand it over.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.208
Along with any other HYDRA assets

35:43.291 --> 35:44.792
you happen to have in your possession.

35:44.875 --> 35:47.166
Sadly, the painting was
destroyed in the fight.

35:47.875 --> 35:49.625
I don't think it was of much value,
anyway.

35:49.709 --> 35:51.333
HYDRA was mistaken about its worth.

35:51.542 --> 35:54.208
And anything else we get,
I'll let you know.

35:54.792 --> 35:58.375
Just to be clear, this is all about a mask

35:58.458 --> 36:00.875
that this guy put on
and made him look like me?

36:00.959 --> 36:02.000
Yeah.

36:02.959 --> 36:06.250
You know, I spent five long months
in an enemy war camp.

36:07.834 --> 36:10.041
You people make me miss those days.

36:11.041 --> 36:14.875
But, hey, why don't we keep chatting
on this secure line you've hacked

36:14.959 --> 36:16.458
so I can draw a bead on your location

36:16.542 --> 36:18.375
and we can get some quality face time...

36:20.834 --> 36:22.917
Some people are better in small doses.

36:24.333 --> 36:25.792
Meanwhile, now we know

36:25.875 --> 36:28.291
HYDRA is searching for evidence
of the alien writing.

36:28.792 --> 36:30.667
-That's not good.
-No. It's not.

36:31.208 --> 36:33.041
And that's not the worst of it.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.667
The analysis of the painting came back.

36:36.750 --> 36:39.917
It is 500 years old. But the alien
writing on the back?

36:40.834 --> 36:41.875
Brand new.

36:42.083 --> 36:44.542
So that means someone is out there
carving right now. Someone...

36:44.625 --> 36:47.375
Someone like me. We'll have to find him.

36:48.709 --> 36:49.750
We will.

36:52.458 --> 36:56.208
So, um, what'd she do? Fake me.

36:57.333 --> 36:58.625
How'd you know that she wasn't me?

36:58.709 --> 36:59.834
Little things.

37:00.667 --> 37:01.917
And she wanted to get coffee.

37:03.375 --> 37:04.250
You punch her in the face?

37:04.333 --> 37:05.792
-I did.
-Good.

37:11.542 --> 37:12.375
May?

37:15.208 --> 37:17.250
I know you won't come
to me to make a plan.

37:17.709 --> 37:18.959
That's why I keep coming to you.

37:19.041 --> 37:20.709
This is important.

37:20.792 --> 37:23.041
I won't stop asking. You know I won't.

37:26.166 --> 37:27.041
Fine.

37:29.333 --> 37:30.667
There.

37:32.750 --> 37:33.709
What is this?

37:35.041 --> 37:37.333
Money. Passports. Travel tickets.

37:37.375 --> 37:40.125
I don't have to make a plan,
because I already made one.

37:40.667 --> 37:42.875
I am not shooting you in the head.

37:43.208 --> 37:45.166
I will never shoot you in the head.

37:45.250 --> 37:46.458
May...

37:46.542 --> 37:48.083
If things go south,

37:48.500 --> 37:49.875
I'm getting you out.

37:50.417 --> 37:51.291
I see.

37:52.542 --> 37:54.458
Where? Tuscan villa?

37:55.417 --> 37:57.750
Cabin. In the Australian Outback.

37:57.834 --> 37:59.250
'Cause I like kangaroos.

37:59.333 --> 38:02.959
Point is, no matter what happens,
I'll take care of you.

38:03.792 --> 38:05.125
That's my plan.

38:08.709 --> 38:10.959
That is, without question, the sweetest,

38:11.166 --> 38:14.333
most selfless thing anyone has ever
wanted to do for me.

38:20.291 --> 38:22.792
But I need you to forget all that
and kill me as ordered.

38:22.875 --> 38:24.917
-What?
-You said it yourself.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.417
I'm not getting better.

38:27.166 --> 38:28.750
I don't wanna end up like Garrett.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.083
And taking me to some cabin
won't change my brain.

38:31.500 --> 38:33.000
I'll find a way.

38:33.083 --> 38:33.959
May.

38:35.375 --> 38:36.583
Nostalgia's fine.

38:37.250 --> 38:38.291
But then life happens.

38:39.125 --> 38:41.000
It's time to deal with reality.

38:42.959 --> 38:46.250
Phil. Please.

38:47.041 --> 38:48.375
Hard choices are coming.

38:49.792 --> 38:51.000
I need you to make this one.

38:51.959 --> 38:52.875
For me.

39:10.834 --> 39:14.125
Yeah. I need to land in Miami
as soon as possible.

39:15.583 --> 39:18.125
Whatever route gets me there. Tonight.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.041
Yes, I'll hold.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.875
Hello, Raina. I'm Daniel Whitehall.

39:41.792 --> 39:43.709
You recently took something from me.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.291
Oh. The Obelisk.

39:49.542 --> 39:51.125
I see what this is now.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.333
I can help you...

39:57.583 --> 39:58.583
Raina,

39:59.041 --> 40:01.291
I'm not like most of the people
with whom you interact.

40:01.375 --> 40:03.250
I'm not easily confused.

40:03.333 --> 40:06.000
I've been around too long
to lose sight of what's mine.

40:06.083 --> 40:08.625
I generally don't do my own
dirty work anymore.

40:08.709 --> 40:13.458
We should all aspire to do only
that which we enjoy, don't you agree?

40:15.125 --> 40:16.875
But in your case,
I will make an exception.

40:18.667 --> 40:20.709
Forty-eight hours seems fair, doesn't it?

40:21.417 --> 40:22.542
To bring it back to me?

40:25.834 --> 40:29.750
I once operated on a woman on-and-off

40:30.792 --> 40:31.875
for a full week.

40:32.417 --> 40:35.208
The struggle really
is keeping the patient awake.

40:35.750 --> 40:39.750
Pain at certain levels has a tendency
to cause us to black out,

40:39.834 --> 40:43.000
and that can be incredibly frustrating.

40:44.208 --> 40:46.083
But I'm confident I can do better now.

40:50.709 --> 40:53.208
I can find you wherever you are.

40:53.291 --> 40:54.500
Bring me the Obelisk.

40:55.208 --> 40:56.458
Forty-eight hours.

40:57.333 --> 41:00.542
The clock starts now.
