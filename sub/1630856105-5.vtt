WEBVTT

02:07.877 --> 02:10.547
Is it true neither of you
have acted before?

02:10.547 --> 02:15.552
Yes. But we're very, very famous,
and that's basically the same thing.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.848
<i>Hello again, friend of a friend</i>

02:19.848 --> 02:21.975
<i>I knew you when</i>

02:23.852 --> 02:29.524
<i>Our common goal
Was waiting for the world to end</i>

02:31.526 --> 02:33.695
<i>Now that the truth...</i>

02:34.612 --> 02:36.990
We're rock stars. We do what we want.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.493
And what we want right now
is to be movie stars.

02:47.876 --> 02:51.212
People keep asking me
if the movie lives up to my "vision."

02:51.212 --> 02:53.590
I guess, if I'm being honest,

02:53.590 --> 02:56.593
<i>this whole shoot
does feel a little blurry.</i>

02:57.177 --> 02:59.345
My mom says I should get my eyes checked.

03:00.221 --> 03:03.224
We're just trying
to honor Mister Neil's tremendous script,

03:03.224 --> 03:07.061
which I think is truly a tribute
to this great city.

03:07.061 --> 03:11.149
I'd even go so far as to say Toronto
is a character in the movie.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.151
A major character.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.361
Really? He said that?

03:16.404 --> 03:18.531
Who did he cast to play Toronto?

03:19.532 --> 03:20.992
Uh, guys,

03:20.992 --> 03:23.953
aren't we supposed to be interviewing
Envy Adams' stunt double now?

03:27.624 --> 03:29.626
Hey, I'm Ramona Flowers.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.921
They said I should come talk to you?
It's my first day.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.256
You're the stunt double
for Ramona Flowers,

03:35.256 --> 03:38.760
and your name is also Ramona Flowers?

03:44.390 --> 03:47.602
Is that Ramona Flowers, the stunt double,
or Ramona Flowers the character?

03:47.602 --> 03:51.773
<i>I'm a physical person,
but I never thought about stunt work.</i>

03:52.899 --> 03:54.817
Turns out I'm pretty good at it.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.027
Ramona!

03:57.820 --> 04:00.490
When you're done up there,
I've got another stunt for you.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.574
No problem.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.659
Great.

04:02.659 --> 04:06.496
I need you to run over to my hotel room
and give my dog some medication.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.706
It'll be in a blue bag on the counter.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.588
Do you think this could be
the beginning of a new career?

04:15.588 --> 04:18.549
Actually, I only took this job
because security realized

04:18.549 --> 04:21.552
I wasn't working on the movie,
and I needed an excuse to be on set

04:21.552 --> 04:25.014
so I could get close enough to Todd
to find out if he used a vegan portal

04:25.014 --> 04:27.642
to kidnap this guy
I went out with one time.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.229
What?

04:31.229 --> 04:33.731
Quiet! We're rehearsing, people!

04:33.731 --> 04:35.692
All right, I guess we're
gonna work on blocking

04:35.692 --> 04:38.027
while our diva gaffer does his thing.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.447
Todd, do you know what blocking is?

04:41.447 --> 04:42.490
Hold it.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.117
No stunts today.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.370
- I just wanted to ask Todd--
- You're not wanted here, Ramona.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.414
Todd is busy.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.000
We're acting, okay?

04:52.500 --> 04:53.960
So, skate on.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.716
As you can see,
the lighting in the scene is super dark

04:59.716 --> 05:02.719
to represent the darkness in Scott's soul.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.805
Young Neil, your glasses.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.391
Yeah, I finally got a prescription.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.477
They're sunglasses.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.023
Wow!

05:15.773 --> 05:17.400
I was wondering.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.903
There's no precedent
for the path you've taken.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.572
From heckling on the sidelines

05:22.572 --> 05:26.159
to co-lead
in a major Canadian blockbuster.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.452
Can you speak to that?

05:27.994 --> 05:32.290
I decided the only thing better
than being me, was getting paid to be me.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.167
Why be Wallace Wells for free?

05:35.501 --> 05:36.669
Quiet on the set!

05:37.378 --> 05:41.758
<i>Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life,</i>
scene 43, take one.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.385
And action!

05:49.265 --> 05:53.478
Why don't we try having Scott
gently put his hand on Ramona's back?

05:54.979 --> 05:56.272
No, cut!

05:57.899 --> 06:01.903
<i>Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life,</i>
scene 43, take two.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.197
And action!

06:04.947 --> 06:08.201
All right, Todd,
just a gentle little touch.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.628
<i>A movie set is kinda like a chemistry set.</i>

06:19.253 --> 06:21.381
<i>Some people just have too much chemistry.</i>

06:21.923 --> 06:25.218
<i>And what happens when you mix
a bunch of volatile chemicals?</i>

06:25.218 --> 06:26.719
You get an explosion.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.930
You do? That's dangerous!

06:28.930 --> 06:32.517
Why are we mixing volatile chemicals
on a movie set in the first place?

06:32.517 --> 06:34.727
Scene 43, take 18.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.270
Action!

06:38.606 --> 06:40.149
Scene 43, take 32!

06:41.067 --> 06:42.110
Action!

06:43.611 --> 06:45.655
Scene 43, take 43.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.281
Action!

06:56.332 --> 06:58.626
<i>We've been together
since we were 11 years old.</i>

06:58.626 --> 07:01.462
Every day more magical than the last.

07:01.462 --> 07:02.755
Right, baby?

07:02.755 --> 07:05.341
Vegans are unusually loyal
to their partners.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.343
They never waver.

07:07.343 --> 07:08.636
That's true.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.519
Hey, buddy, it's not that bad.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.355
Maybe we just need to rethink the scene.

07:19.355 --> 07:22.567
This is the dumb version. But what if...

07:25.528 --> 07:26.362
Yes!

07:27.196 --> 07:28.114
Yes!

07:28.948 --> 07:31.701
Scene 43, take 44.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.203
And action!

07:36.956 --> 07:39.417
Scott and Wallace.
Let's look at each other.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.377
Deep into each other's eyes.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.337
You've never seen
eyes like these in your life.

07:45.047 --> 07:48.301
You're forgetting Ramona,
forgetting all about her.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.930
Now, kiss!
Kiss like your life depends on it!

08:06.194 --> 08:07.653
Cut! Print!

08:07.653 --> 08:11.908
I think we're onto something here, gang.
Scott, Wallace, great work!

08:12.575 --> 08:14.660
I don't remember writing that part.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.538
That's lunch, people!

08:31.093 --> 08:32.178
- Ramona!
- Ramona!

08:32.178 --> 08:35.681
Would you do us a huge favor
and give this to Envy Adams?

08:35.681 --> 08:38.392
We wrote a song
for her to sing in the movie!

08:38.893 --> 08:42.146
Please! It's like a cross
between the last number in <i>All That Jazz</i>

08:42.146 --> 08:43.898
and the first number in <i>Grease 2!</i>

08:46.859 --> 08:48.402
What just happened?

08:49.278 --> 08:50.196
Not sure.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.406
Want to run lines in your trailer?

09:02.583 --> 09:07.171
Hey, so, quick question about the script.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.048
Run lines in your trailer?

09:12.343 --> 09:13.678
Lines in your trailer?

09:16.681 --> 09:17.807
Lines? Trailer?

09:19.100 --> 09:19.976
Okay.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.563
<i>He's my best friend,
best friend with benefits.</i>

09:24.188 --> 09:25.565
It's a lifelong thing for us.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.317
Sure, we experimented with other people.

09:28.317 --> 09:31.821
He dated Ramona. I dated Scott Pilgrim.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.948
But he always came back to me.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.284
I'm his destiny.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.327
<i>Me and Todd?</i>

09:39.745 --> 09:40.830
Yeah.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.041
<i>He went to my high school junior year.</i>

09:44.542 --> 09:47.628
<i>He told me the love of his life
was waiting for him back in Canada.</i>

09:48.296 --> 09:50.881
<i>He also told me
that he liked to live in the moment.</i>

09:51.382 --> 09:53.968
<i>That generally meant sloppy make outs
behind the school.</i>

09:57.471 --> 10:00.683
Is it true he punched a hole
in the moon for you?

10:00.683 --> 10:03.269
- Teleported to the moon and--
- Absolutely.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.564
Yes, he did.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.191
The most romantic thing I've ever seen.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.736
The most horrifying thing I've ever seen.

10:17.867 --> 10:18.743
Ramona.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.828
We need to talk about Scott Pilgrim.

10:20.828 --> 10:21.996
I'm Scott Pilgrim.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.497
No, I mean--

10:26.083 --> 10:27.084
Hold that thought.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.461
Wallace.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.004
Co-worker.

10:39.597 --> 10:40.931
<i>At the end of day two,</i>

10:40.931 --> 10:44.852
<i>the production was
already 17 million dollars over budget,</i>

10:44.852 --> 10:47.021
<i>with only three shots in the can.</i>

10:50.900 --> 10:52.526
Today I have a big fight scene,

10:52.526 --> 10:56.238
but I'm really hoping to pull Todd away
from Wallace for a few minutes.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.701
They always seem to be
running lines in his trailer.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.787
You two have incredible chemistry...

11:03.287 --> 11:05.206
<i>What's it like working with Wallace Wells?</i>

11:06.666 --> 11:08.626
<i>He's taught me so much about acting.</i>

11:08.626 --> 11:10.461
<i>No. About living.</i>

11:11.003 --> 11:13.297
<i>What can you even say
about a man like that?</i>

11:21.806 --> 11:23.557
- Babe?
- Envy!

11:24.433 --> 11:25.726
I can't be with you anymore!

11:26.435 --> 11:28.437
I'm in love with Wallace Wells!

11:29.146 --> 11:29.980
What?

11:31.148 --> 11:33.776
I'm changing! I feel myself changing.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.486
I'm a new person.

11:35.486 --> 11:36.696
A new boy!

11:37.780 --> 11:39.240
My skin is clearer!

11:39.240 --> 11:40.449
It's love.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.454
She's walking away?

11:46.539 --> 11:47.998
I thought she'd be happy for me.

11:47.998 --> 11:51.961
Todd, what happened to
all that "vegans never waver" stuff?

11:51.961 --> 11:55.923
I never said that.
I said, "vegans never wafer."

11:56.590 --> 11:58.968
We don't eat wafers. That's true.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.803
They never waver.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.888
Never waver...

12:03.556 --> 12:08.644
Look, any rumors about me having
a very hot on-set affair are just rumors.

12:08.644 --> 12:09.562
I'm--

12:10.938 --> 12:12.815
Excuse me, I'm talking to the camera here.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.401
Tell him what you just told me.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.571
I'm...

12:22.450 --> 12:23.868
He's in love with me, isn't he?

12:25.035 --> 12:25.870
Well?

12:30.124 --> 12:31.417
I'll fix this.

12:31.417 --> 12:35.588
Todd, buddy,
this was just an on-set fling.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.214
What?

12:37.214 --> 12:40.217
When the movie ends,
so does the relationship.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.427
Tale as old as time.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.388
You don't love me?

12:44.889 --> 12:47.057
But what about the sparks?

12:47.975 --> 12:49.185
What sparks?

12:52.229 --> 12:53.063
Todd!

12:53.063 --> 12:54.690
Baby! Sweetheart!

13:08.788 --> 13:10.206
Wallace Wells!

13:12.291 --> 13:15.169
You broke my boyfriend!

13:15.169 --> 13:18.255
Prepare to die!

13:24.303 --> 13:25.221
No fair!

13:26.806 --> 13:28.390
Stop it.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.394
Jeez, have some dignity.
This is a film set.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.481
If you want to fight with me,
fight with them.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.780
Four stunt doubles?

13:42.780 --> 13:45.032
They only gave me one!

13:45.032 --> 13:46.408
It's in my contract.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.994
Get a better lawyer, baby.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.415
Ramona, time for stunts!

13:53.415 --> 13:56.627
- Wait, what? I'm doing an interview--
- Do you want to keep your job?

13:58.671 --> 14:00.130
Where's everybody going?

14:12.685 --> 14:15.479
<i>Wallace Wells versus Envy Adams!</i>

14:15.479 --> 14:16.438
<i>Fight!</i>

14:17.398 --> 14:18.566
Who said that?

14:19.066 --> 14:20.150
<i>Nobody.</i>

14:20.776 --> 14:22.611
What part of the movie is this?

14:24.655 --> 14:26.031
Don't embarrass me, guys!

14:29.577 --> 14:31.036
Straight Wallace?

14:31.036 --> 14:32.705
You're a stunt double now?

14:33.372 --> 14:36.667
Why are you acting like that's weird?
You made the exact same career change.

14:36.667 --> 14:40.045
Well, I did it for very specific reasons.

14:40.629 --> 14:44.216
Fight them! Fight the Wallaces!
If you lose, you're fired.

14:48.762 --> 14:51.015
That's the sloppiest headbutt
I've ever seen.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.939
You call that a backflip? Terrible form!

15:02.359 --> 15:06.071
You give stunts a bad name.
This is tragic. You're all so slow!

15:11.535 --> 15:14.622
When was the last time you hit the gym?
Too many french fries!

15:14.622 --> 15:16.040
Come on, man.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.920
We can handle physical abuse,
but we draw the line at verbal abuse.

15:24.924 --> 15:25.799
Hey!

15:26.383 --> 15:28.302
Well, well, Wells.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.722
I guess now it's time
for you to fight your own fight.

15:32.222 --> 15:34.642
But not against me, against Ramona.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.561
Okay, time out, cut!

15:38.896 --> 15:41.815
Why does your character want
to fight Wallace in the first place?

15:41.815 --> 15:44.860
This isn't for the movie.
This is for real life.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.488
I broke her boyfriend.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.115
You and Todd?

15:54.620 --> 15:56.872
No more stunts. Where is he?

16:01.335 --> 16:03.170
Todd, we need to talk.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.718
Todd.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.762
Breaking vegan edge?

16:13.555 --> 16:14.723
Step inside.

16:19.603 --> 16:23.107
Welcome to my crib.
Let me give you a quick tour.

16:25.442 --> 16:28.570
Over there is the first place
I made out with Wallace.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.534
This is the second place
I made out with Wallace.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.204
And this is the third place where I--

16:37.204 --> 16:39.081
Nobody needs this information, Todd.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.541
Yeah, I think we're good.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.960
This trailer holds so many memories.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.755
It's where I fell in love
for the first time.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.215
The first time?

16:48.757 --> 16:53.303
Envy, what we had was fun,
but I discovered a new kind of fun.

16:53.929 --> 16:57.057
The kind of fun
where you care about another person.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.184
You wouldn't understand.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.520
What about us?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.898
You've known him for three ****ing days!

17:04.898 --> 17:06.316
Is that all it's been?

17:06.316 --> 17:08.694
Even if it had just been two days,

17:08.694 --> 17:11.113
I'd be chasing that high
for the rest of my life.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.407
You can't fight the moonlight, babe.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.705
All right, I'm too famous
for this conversation.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.123
We're done. Goodbye.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.082
Hold on.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.793
We need to talk about Scott Pilgrim.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.503
I'm Scott Pilgrim.

17:26.503 --> 17:29.089
No, the real Scott Pilgrim.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.717
The guy you kidnapped
using a vegan portal.

17:38.015 --> 17:38.849
Here.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.188
I don't know if you did this alone,
or if Envy put you up to it.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.148
No one puts me up to anything.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.400
Only I put me up to things.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.736
It's a vegan portal, all right.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.697
But it's better than anything
Todd's ever made.

17:53.697 --> 17:56.366
I mean, look at
the thought that went into it,

17:56.366 --> 17:57.826
the craftsmanship.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.870
Todd didn't do this.

17:59.870 --> 18:00.788
That was rude...

18:02.206 --> 18:03.332
...but I'll allow it.

18:05.334 --> 18:08.003
You spent three days following my orders

18:08.003 --> 18:10.839
because you wanted
to show Todd a video of a portal?

18:10.839 --> 18:12.591
You have no other leads?

18:12.591 --> 18:13.801
Tragic.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.761
Looks like you're never gonna find him.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.179
Maybe you should give up.

18:17.179 --> 18:20.182
Sometimes you just need
to leave losers in the past.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.435
Are you talking about Scott or me?

18:30.067 --> 18:32.319
And by the way, you're fired.

18:32.319 --> 18:33.320
I quit.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.897
Mr. Patel,
welcome to the Great White North.

19:08.897 --> 19:12.401
Yeah, it's great.
Everyone here works for me, right?

19:12.401 --> 19:14.153
- Yes, sir!
- Good!

19:17.030 --> 19:18.532
You're all fired!

19:18.532 --> 19:20.159
Sir, did you just say--

19:20.159 --> 19:21.660
Shut up! Guards!

19:25.038 --> 19:26.582
Hey, you! You over there.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.793
- Aren't you the director?
- Yes!

19:29.793 --> 19:31.336
- You're fired!
- No!

19:33.839 --> 19:36.633
What? Are you shooting
a documentary or something?

19:36.633 --> 19:37.801
Yeah.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.470
Well, not anymore.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.014
Hey, man. Get off me, man. Stop.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.104
Well, that was a waste
of our precious little time.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.857
All those people are cuckoo crazy.
All of them are.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.277
All of you, go home. Take off!

19:56.153 --> 19:57.487
We don't work for you.

19:58.113 --> 20:01.658
We just want a moment of your time.
We have an exciting opportunity.

20:01.658 --> 20:07.080
If you give us a chance,
we will blow your mind!

20:08.332 --> 20:12.211
I like your moxie, kids.
I have 30 seconds available next Tuesday.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.550
Call my girls. Let's make this happen.

20:22.429 --> 20:23.847
Matthew Patel.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.601
Ramona Flowers.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.729
What's with the outfit? Are you a CEO?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.857
Actually, yes.
I'm here to shut this movie down.

20:33.857 --> 20:37.736
I guess that was inevitable.
It's probably losing you a lot of money.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.114
Money? Who cares about money?

20:41.114 --> 20:42.699
Have you read the script?

20:43.200 --> 20:46.870
It's a character assassination of me,
Matthew Patel!

20:46.870 --> 20:50.874
I won that fight!
I punched Scott Pilgrim to death!

20:50.874 --> 20:53.627
Well, you didn't
actually punch him to death.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.296
Someone kidnapped him
and made it look like you won.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.967
- I didn't win?
- No.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.386
- He's not dead?
- No.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.597
- Is he mad at me?
- I don't know, dude.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.975
I'm trying to find him
and figure out who did this.

21:08.850 --> 21:12.229
But you know I took my new-found
confidence from killing Scott Pilgrim

21:12.229 --> 21:14.398
and went back and defeated Gideon, right?

21:14.398 --> 21:15.399
I'm sorry?

21:15.983 --> 21:18.318
I went up against Gideon and won it all.

21:18.318 --> 21:23.240
Two record labels, this movie studio,
14 animal shelters,

21:23.240 --> 21:25.200
and The League of Evil Exes.

21:25.826 --> 21:29.538
The empire's mine, and I plan to keep it.

21:29.538 --> 21:33.500
I won't make the same mistakes he made.
I won't end up where he is now.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.877
Which is where exactly?

21:35.877 --> 21:37.671
Here, Toronto.

21:37.671 --> 21:40.382
He's shacking up with some girl
named Julie-something.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.843
Did you know Gideon
isn't even his real name?

21:42.843 --> 21:44.219
It's not?

21:44.219 --> 21:47.431
No, it's Gordon. Gordon Goose.

21:47.431 --> 21:48.348
What?

21:48.348 --> 21:51.059
Everything we knew
about that guy was a lie.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.689
This Julie, it wouldn't be Julie Powers?

21:55.689 --> 21:58.108
Yeah, that's it. You know her?

21:58.108 --> 21:59.276
I thought I did.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.958
Where are you going?

22:14.958 --> 22:17.461
Julie Powers and I need to talk.
