<i>♪ You are my
sunshine My only sunshine</i>

00:22.713 --> 00:28.184
<i>♪ You make me happy
When skies are gray ♪</i>

00:28.218 --> 00:33.791
But you never heard me
when I said I love you.

00:33.824 --> 00:36.292
Please don't take
my sunshine away.

00:46.003 --> 00:47.604
<i>Life has a drift to it,</i>

00:50.507 --> 00:52.308
<i>a current that
pushes us through.</i>

00:54.444 --> 00:56.881
<i>And yet it's often at odds
with the gravity of who we are.</i>

01:00.951 --> 01:03.620
<i>The constant push and pull
between right and wrong.</i>

01:06.791 --> 01:08.324
<i>Some call it good and bad.</i>

01:09.860 --> 01:11.327
<i>Others call it
black and white.</i>

01:13.463 --> 01:15.198
<i>Nobody talks about gray.</i>

01:17.500 --> 01:18.936
<i>Real life
lives in the gray.</i>

01:40.423 --> 01:43.526
"There is a real evil
in the world, Mom.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.463
"A pure evil.
I've seen it."

01:47.631 --> 01:49.299
You remember
writing that letter?

01:51.301 --> 01:52.335
Yes, sir.

01:53.671 --> 01:57.307
Can you explain to us what
exactly you meant by those words?

01:58.709 --> 02:01.277
Well, evil exists
under lock and key in here.

02:03.313 --> 02:06.650
But out in the real world,
you don't always see it coming.

02:06.684 --> 02:09.551
It tends to hide
in plain sight out there.

02:09.586 --> 02:11.287
If released.

02:11.321 --> 02:12.790
If...

02:12.823 --> 02:15.558
How do you think you'd do
around all that evil?

02:22.666 --> 02:23.768
It's hard to say.

02:27.037 --> 02:28.939
You do understand
how that sounds?

02:28.973 --> 02:32.408
Yeah, it makes us think you'd
go back to a life of crime.

02:32.442 --> 02:33.811
I was never
in a life of crime.

02:35.713 --> 02:37.014
You were arrested.

02:38.348 --> 02:39.750
Took a plea deal.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.484
And I did
what my PD told me to do.

02:44.587 --> 02:46.623
Do you take responsibility
for your crime?

02:50.761 --> 02:52.863
As much as I can.
Yes, sir.

02:54.965 --> 02:57.600
Have you kept in contact
with anyone on the outside?

02:59.737 --> 03:00.805
Mr. Walker?

03:04.440 --> 03:05.843
Anything else
you care to add?

03:10.080 --> 03:12.315
My mother had me
when she was very young.

03:13.951 --> 03:15.451
My father
wasn't really around,

03:15.485 --> 03:17.520
and we didn't have
much family to speak of.

03:17.554 --> 03:18.555
So...

03:19.556 --> 03:20.557
I owe her.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.527
She's the main reason
I want to get out.

03:33.037 --> 03:34.470
Mr. Walker,

03:34.504 --> 03:38.575
it appears to this board that you are
not yet rehabilitated to the point

03:38.608 --> 03:40.911
of being released
back into society.

03:40.945 --> 03:42.579
Therefore, we're recommend...

03:59.029 --> 04:02.700
Okay, Mr. Walker.

04:02.733 --> 04:04.534
You've caught us
on a charitable day.

04:05.736 --> 04:08.571
We're giving you that chance
to take care of your mother.

04:09.206 --> 04:11.474
And, son,

04:11.507 --> 04:15.445
stay away from any evil
you may encounter out there.

05:28.752 --> 05:31.255
You're home.

05:31.288 --> 05:32.790
You're home.

05:32.823 --> 05:34.992
You're home.

05:35.025 --> 05:36.927
You're home.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.529
I remember the first time
I got popped.

05:39.562 --> 05:42.733
I stole a dirt bike
from my asshole neighbor.

05:42.766 --> 05:45.169
I was just borrowing it
from the old bastard.

05:46.837 --> 05:49.539
They gave me
30 days in the pen,

05:49.572 --> 05:51.607
but I only served four.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.243
Guess I made the other guys
too nervous.

05:56.780 --> 05:59.149
Bet a month is just a drop
in the bucket to you, huh?

06:27.244 --> 06:29.545
Doc sign off
on you drinking?

06:29.579 --> 06:30.881
It's only one beer.
I'm fine.

06:33.150 --> 06:35.551
Imagine it's pretty stressful
having the kid back?

06:35.585 --> 06:37.587
His name's Billy.

06:37.620 --> 06:38.889
Don't turn this
around on me.

06:38.922 --> 06:40.623
He's the one sitting there
like a space case.

06:40.657 --> 06:42.126
He just needs
a little bit of time

06:42.159 --> 06:43.827
to get back
in the swing of things.

06:43.861 --> 06:45.863
Just a little bit of time.

06:45.896 --> 06:48.098
Guys always come out
of there even more fucked up.

06:48.132 --> 06:51.168
What's your excuse,
Mr. Four Days?

06:51.201 --> 06:52.602
You need to
keep an eye on him.

06:52.636 --> 06:54.038
He could freak out
at any moment.

06:54.071 --> 06:55.639
Don't tell me
how to raise my son.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.909
Next you'll be telling me
you need your space.

06:58.942 --> 07:00.144
Don't be a cliche.

07:00.177 --> 07:02.646
I'm not the one
acting like a drunken ass.

07:02.679 --> 07:04.580
I'm just playing my role
in this fucking good time.

07:04.614 --> 07:06.750
Are you really sure
you want to do this?

07:06.784 --> 07:08.218
Okay, buddy. Time to go.

07:08.252 --> 07:10.187
Ho ho, what do you know?

07:10.220 --> 07:11.621
He can talk.

07:13.090 --> 07:14.624
You think
prison made you a man?

07:16.660 --> 07:17.728
Do you want to find out?

07:20.798 --> 07:22.166
Billy! Billy, Billy!
That's enough.

07:22.199 --> 07:23.667
Inside. It's enough.
Inside, inside.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.269
- Hey, buddy.
- Inside! I got this.

07:25.302 --> 07:28.138
If you only did four days, you would
have served that in County, not prison.

07:28.172 --> 07:30.140
You might want to get your
shit straight next time.

07:30.174 --> 07:31.607
Just go inside.

07:31.642 --> 07:33.877
Go on. I got this.
I got this.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.245
I got it.

07:35.279 --> 07:36.747
God!

07:37.981 --> 07:39.283
- What's wrong with you?
- What?

07:39.316 --> 07:41.151
Do you want me
to apologize?

07:41.185 --> 07:43.619
Thought someday
I'd be husband number three.

07:43.654 --> 07:45.222
Keep dreaming.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.042
He's a big talker
when he's drunk.

08:06.276 --> 08:08.178
Yeah. Well, there's
a lot of those inside.

08:08.212 --> 08:09.279
I'm sorry he hit you.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.149
I'm sorry,
I stuck my nose in.

08:12.182 --> 08:13.250
No, you didn't.

08:13.283 --> 08:14.218
You didn't.

08:14.251 --> 08:17.154
He was never a long term
kind of guy anyway.

08:17.187 --> 08:19.389
Well, you could do better.

08:19.423 --> 08:20.757
Story of my life.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.763
Mom.

08:26.797 --> 08:29.933
Why do you have to ask your
doctor if you can have a beer?

08:29.967 --> 08:32.402
I didn't wanna
tell you when you were in there.

08:32.436 --> 08:34.071
I... I didn't see the point.

08:34.104 --> 08:36.173
You know, why worry you?

08:36.206 --> 08:37.307
Huh?

08:37.341 --> 08:40.010
Well, you've done
plenty of that for me.

08:40.043 --> 08:41.778
That's different.
I am the parent.

08:43.046 --> 08:45.215
You had me
when you were 15.

08:45.249 --> 08:46.817
It's not like
you had a choice.

08:49.253 --> 08:51.021
It's my liver.

08:51.054 --> 08:52.823
I need a new one.

08:52.856 --> 08:54.124
I'm on one of those lists.

09:00.330 --> 09:01.365
How long does that take?

09:01.398 --> 09:02.566
They...
They don't know.

09:02.599 --> 09:07.804
I'm AB negative,
which happens to be a rare blood type.

09:07.838 --> 09:11.909
Turns out your mom
is just a shitty match.

09:15.779 --> 09:17.748
What can I do?

09:17.781 --> 09:19.917
You can help me do the dishes.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.985
Come on, Mom. Fucking dishes.
I'm serious.

09:23.387 --> 09:25.422
God, Billy, I'm a big girl.

09:25.455 --> 09:27.057
I can take care of myself.

09:32.429 --> 09:34.231
You should let me show you
a little appreciation.

09:36.433 --> 09:38.035
Billy, you've been
punished enough.

09:45.976 --> 09:47.144
He really
couldn't hit for shit.

09:47.177 --> 09:50.881
You are right. He was a big ass.
Wasn't he?

09:50.914 --> 09:52.149
Yeah, he's kinda the worst.

09:52.182 --> 09:53.984
Yeah, he really was.

09:54.518 --> 09:56.119
Uh, he really was.

09:59.356 --> 10:00.757
Thanks for always
looking after me.

10:00.791 --> 10:03.160
Oh, Billy,
you made a mistake.

10:03.193 --> 10:05.462
You just... just
made a mistake.

10:05.495 --> 10:07.130
It's time to move on.

10:07.164 --> 10:08.265
Yup.

10:10.567 --> 10:11.902
Yup.

11:04.621 --> 11:07.324
Aw!

11:07.357 --> 11:09.960
Oh! You made breakfast?

11:09.993 --> 11:11.261
Well, ya.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.497
I told you get used to
some changes around here.

11:13.530 --> 11:15.232
Yeah.

11:15.265 --> 11:16.833
I love it. It's just, uh,

11:16.867 --> 11:18.335
uh, not really hungry.

11:18.368 --> 11:19.603
Here, there's 50.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.138
It should be enough.
Better be enough.

11:21.171 --> 11:23.206
Okay, I'll be home
around 6:00.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.241
Okay.

11:24.274 --> 11:26.443
And I left your
resumes on the desk.

11:47.064 --> 11:48.298
How can I help you, Billy?

11:49.333 --> 11:50.967
Yeah, my mother, Grace.

11:51.001 --> 11:53.203
Um, I think she's
a patient of yours.

11:53.236 --> 11:54.538
You're the son?

11:55.072 --> 11:57.307
Yeah.

11:57.341 --> 12:00.577
I'm sorry, but I can't discuss
a patient's condition.

12:02.079 --> 12:04.414
Well, Doc. I mean.

12:04.448 --> 12:07.384
I know she's
on the list, man.

12:07.417 --> 12:09.252
She told you
she needs a new liver?

12:12.022 --> 12:13.156
I don't understand.

12:13.190 --> 12:15.459
I mean, she literally
never drank.

12:15.492 --> 12:17.561
It's not from drinking.

12:17.594 --> 12:20.530
Sometimes the liver
just shuts down.

12:20.564 --> 12:24.101
It could be genetics,
or any number of factors.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.637
What about, uh, a living
donor or one of those?

12:26.671 --> 12:29.940
Ah, her liver's too far gone
for a partial or living donor.

12:29.973 --> 12:33.076
Believe me,
we tried everything.

12:33.110 --> 12:35.212
Her liver just hasn't responded
the way we would have hoped.

12:38.181 --> 12:39.216
How long?

12:41.385 --> 12:42.619
That's always hard to say.

12:44.421 --> 12:45.889
Well, pretend she's your mom.

12:49.292 --> 12:52.095
Six months, maybe a year.

12:56.533 --> 12:57.601
Okay.

13:00.971 --> 13:02.072
And the list?

13:04.241 --> 13:07.277
Unfortunately,
she's fairly far down on it.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.947
Well, how can I
move her up it?

13:12.048 --> 13:13.116
You can't.

13:16.586 --> 13:17.655
Excuse me.

13:24.729 --> 13:27.364
Hey.

13:27.397 --> 13:29.533
You know where I've been
for the last seven years?

13:33.170 --> 13:34.639
Yeah.

13:34.672 --> 13:37.274
I'll go back before she suffers
any more than she has to.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.348
I'll obviously deny
we ever had this conversation.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.519
But I know a doctor
over in Juarez

13:49.553 --> 13:51.087
that can get you
a healthy liver.

13:52.322 --> 13:53.390
It's not cheap.

13:55.058 --> 13:56.727
It's far from ethical,
or legal.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.665
But money talks a little louder
across the wall.

14:03.166 --> 14:04.201
How much?

14:06.102 --> 14:08.472
$160,000
is the going rate.

14:11.742 --> 14:14.277
Now, if you'll excuse me.

14:41.404 --> 14:43.006
Resume is a little light,
Billy.

14:46.176 --> 14:49.246
I'm just
fucking with you, <i>pendejo.</i>

14:49.279 --> 14:51.649
Oh, and I know about your, uh.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.350
vacation.

14:54.417 --> 14:55.452
Yeah.

14:57.087 --> 14:59.589
Wait, Billy, please.

14:59.623 --> 15:02.325
Look, I would hire you, man.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.127
I mean, you saved my ass
a few times back in school.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.529
I remember that.

15:05.562 --> 15:08.633
But my dad,
he owns the place.

15:08.666 --> 15:12.202
He's old school,
neck ties and shit.

15:12.235 --> 15:15.105
He wouldn't let a felon
within a mile of his cars.

15:16.741 --> 15:18.375
Sorry, man.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.307
Hello?

15:52.777 --> 15:53.811
When?

16:19.904 --> 16:21.639
Mr. Walker.

16:21.672 --> 16:23.206
We got her stable.

16:23.239 --> 16:26.142
She's not in any pain now.

16:26.176 --> 16:28.244
So, she passed out
from her medications?

16:28.278 --> 16:30.180
Not likely.

16:30.213 --> 16:33.718
We ran a cardiac enzyme
and PT INR.

16:33.751 --> 16:36.186
I'm afraid her liver's
worse than we thought.

16:36.219 --> 16:37.487
I don't know
what that means, man,

16:37.520 --> 16:39.322
'cause you were
supposed to be monitoring her.

16:39.356 --> 16:41.892
She missed her
last two appointments.

16:41.926 --> 16:43.493
We haven't been able to
test her in over a month.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.731
I'm sorry to
have to tell you this,

16:46.764 --> 16:49.634
but her timetable
has accelerated.

16:54.537 --> 16:55.605
How long?

16:56.573 --> 16:58.375
Two months.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.378
We can keep her
comfortable here,

17:03.346 --> 17:04.580
but without a new liver...

17:42.285 --> 17:43.654
John, I need you.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.288
Uh, no.

17:45.321 --> 17:47.658
No, no, I did a double.
I'm out of here.

17:47.692 --> 17:50.628
Come on. I got three patients
who could code at any moment.

17:50.661 --> 17:52.863
I... I...

17:58.002 --> 17:59.602
Thanks.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.574
Hi.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.346
Do you believe
in love at first sight?

18:12.817 --> 18:19.222
Uh. you got
a unique way of expressing it.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.759
I'm sorry.

18:21.792 --> 18:26.731
I was just kidding.
I I've seen a lot worse.

18:26.764 --> 18:29.033
Yeah, I can only imagine.

18:29.066 --> 18:32.002
Uh, you don't want to imagine.
Trust me.

18:32.036 --> 18:35.773
Um, could you do something
about these lights?

18:35.806 --> 18:37.440
It's not really
doing me any favors.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.013
Here.

18:43.047 --> 18:45.015
Yeah, just cool you off
a little bit.

18:45.049 --> 18:46.884
It's clean.

18:46.917 --> 18:50.788
A cool towel.

18:50.821 --> 18:51.989
Manners.

18:53.490 --> 18:55.993
All part
of the service, ma'am.

18:56.026 --> 18:59.262
Oh, boy, I really hope
you forget this is how we met.

18:59.964 --> 19:02.565
Forget love at first sight?

19:02.599 --> 19:03.901
I don't think I can do that.

19:05.368 --> 19:06.971
I'm John.

19:07.004 --> 19:08.404
Grace Andrews.

19:09.807 --> 19:11.976
Grace Andrews?

19:14.611 --> 19:15.646
Sorry.

19:17.648 --> 19:20.718
Um. I don't think
we've ever met,

19:20.751 --> 19:23.687
but. your face is familiar.

19:24.655 --> 19:26.389
Hmm, I don't think so.

19:26.422 --> 19:28.893
I just have
one of those faces.

19:28.926 --> 19:31.695
Just one of those faces that's
launched a million mistakes.

19:35.398 --> 19:38.869
I'd shake your hand, except,
uh, under the circumstances...

19:38.903 --> 19:40.370
Oh, no, no, no, don't worry.

19:40.403 --> 19:43.674
I I deal with a lot of dirt
in my job, too.

19:43.707 --> 19:44.875
I work at a law firm.

19:44.909 --> 19:46.442
Oh, you're a lawyer?

19:46.476 --> 19:47.845
No, receptionist.

19:47.878 --> 19:49.013
Ah.

19:49.046 --> 19:51.682
Crappy pay,
but great insurance,

19:51.715 --> 19:55.719
this comfy bed and.
fantastic room service.

19:55.753 --> 19:59.556
Is this
your first night in the palace?

19:59.589 --> 20:00.758
How'd you guess?

20:00.791 --> 20:03.661
It's part of my job
to know these things.

20:03.694 --> 20:05.863
Crappy pay, lousy benefits,

20:05.896 --> 20:10.100
but for some reason,
I... I keep on coming back.

20:10.134 --> 20:13.570
It's also my job to change
the name on the board.

20:13.603 --> 20:14.604
Andrews.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.808
There.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.475
Now you're official, hmm.

20:20.845 --> 20:25.515
Boy, I'm glad
that last guy is gone.

20:25.548 --> 20:27.151
He was a total
pain in the neck.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.053
He kept throwing up.

20:29.086 --> 20:30.520
Sick bastard.

20:30.553 --> 20:32.022
You can't even imagine.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.623
I don't really want to.

20:33.657 --> 20:35.926
I promise,
I'm not gonna be a pain.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.661
Good.

20:37.695 --> 20:38.796
Well...

20:41.665 --> 20:43.901
always nice to make
an unexpected friend, huh.

20:46.170 --> 20:48.538
You can never
have too many.

20:48.571 --> 20:50.841
Yeah.
Can I get you anything else?

20:50.875 --> 20:52.109
No.

20:52.142 --> 20:54.945
Well, in that case,
Grace Andrews...

20:56.814 --> 20:57.848
Lights out.

20:58.849 --> 20:59.917
Sleep tight.

21:24.875 --> 21:26.777
Don't give me that face.

21:26.810 --> 21:30.080
It's the only one I got.

21:30.114 --> 21:32.082
I know I have
lousy timing, huh.

21:34.118 --> 21:35.719
Doc says
you're not in any pain.

21:35.753 --> 21:38.122
I'd be at work right now if
they'd let me get out of here.

21:39.790 --> 21:41.225
If I could only
trade places with you.

21:41.258 --> 21:42.960
Oh, come on. Stop.

21:42.993 --> 21:44.460
You've been cooped up
for way too long.

21:44.494 --> 21:45.863
It's my turn for a little while.

21:47.031 --> 21:48.498
What can I do?

21:48.531 --> 21:50.533
You can get out of here.
Go have some fun.

21:50.566 --> 21:52.136
There'll be time
for fun later.

21:52.169 --> 21:53.737
You're a lousy liar.

21:55.005 --> 21:56.040
Go on.

21:57.573 --> 21:58.608
All right.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.778
Get some rest, okay?

22:00.811 --> 22:02.179
Mm-hmm.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.717
Gotta go earn my keep.

22:06.750 --> 22:07.918
Hmm.

23:14.685 --> 23:17.121
Staring at it won't
make it go down any easier.

23:17.154 --> 23:18.822
Mr. Walker's a bad man.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.959
Excuse me?

23:21.992 --> 23:23.559
Your shot, Johnny Walker.

23:25.195 --> 23:27.865
Don't tell me I have to
cut you off after none?

23:27.898 --> 23:29.333
Walker's my last name.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.234
Really?

23:30.267 --> 23:33.603
Yeah, I haven't
had a shot in a while.

23:33.637 --> 23:34.705
It's your birthday?

23:35.639 --> 23:36.707
No.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.742
Why start now?

23:38.776 --> 23:40.144
Get fired or somethin'?

23:40.177 --> 23:41.879
To be fired,
I'd have to have a job.

23:41.912 --> 23:44.248
But those seem hard to come by.

23:44.281 --> 23:45.282
Tell me about it.

23:45.315 --> 23:48.318
I was over a UTEP
studying to become a teacher.

23:48.352 --> 23:50.586
I didn't finish, 'cause
I had to pay the bills.

23:51.621 --> 23:53.057
Take what you can get nowadays.

23:53.090 --> 23:55.726
- Yeah.
- Yo, bitches, Tyler's in the house.

23:55.759 --> 23:57.961
Yo, yo, J Bone.
Can I get another beer, please?

23:57.995 --> 23:59.063
Jesus, man.

24:00.864 --> 24:04.001
Oh shit. Yo, Billy.
When you get back, man?

24:06.236 --> 24:08.172
All right.
I can respect that.

24:08.205 --> 24:10.307
It's been a minute.
You good?

24:10.340 --> 24:13.877
Yeah, man. I'm...
I'm okay. I'm okay.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.045
How you been?

24:15.079 --> 24:17.948
You know, chillin',
livin' the dream,

24:17.981 --> 24:20.284
makin' that sick green.
You know what I mean?

24:20.317 --> 24:22.152
What are you doing
for work now?

24:22.186 --> 24:24.354
I'm the mother fucking mayor
of the west side.

24:24.388 --> 24:27.191
Makin' my rounds, visitin'
all of my constituents.

24:29.026 --> 24:32.062
No, I'm just
fucking with you, man.

24:32.096 --> 24:34.832
Slanging that Tina.
You want a "G"?

24:34.865 --> 24:36.700
Ho sale discount.

24:36.733 --> 24:38.702
Oh no, but I'm
I'm straight, thank you.

24:43.407 --> 24:44.942
I could use a job.

24:45.776 --> 24:47.211
Can't help you there.

24:47.244 --> 24:48.846
Upper management
makes those calls.

24:51.715 --> 24:54.251
Yo, J train, can you get
my boy Billy here another shot?

24:55.953 --> 24:56.954
Thanks, man.

24:59.022 --> 25:01.758
Thank you.

25:01.792 --> 25:05.762
Yo, that girl, Jen.
Uff, she got a body like a race track, man.

25:05.796 --> 25:09.032
I've been trying to run the
Indy 500 on that ass for years.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.402
Hey, you sure
you can't help me out, man?

25:15.305 --> 25:18.442
Look, man,
drug trade ain't for you.

25:18.475 --> 25:22.346
Shit so corporate now.
Cartel runs a tight ass ship.

25:22.379 --> 25:26.917
People disappear on the regular
for the tiniest little slip ups.

25:26.950 --> 25:28.886
Ain't no forgiveness
for ran outs.

25:28.919 --> 25:31.155
Yo! Yeah, man, I just.
I hear you, brother.

25:31.188 --> 25:33.824
I just... just need
some fucking cash.

25:33.857 --> 25:35.025
You know what I mean?

25:36.927 --> 25:39.329
Just what the fuck, man!

25:39.363 --> 25:40.964
I'm a cop now?

25:40.998 --> 25:43.300
You're comin' on
mad strong, Billy.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.870
I gotta make sure 5-0 ain't
puttin' the screws to you.

25:46.904 --> 25:49.139
Brother, I promise you,
I'm not on their radar. Okay.

25:50.874 --> 25:52.276
My issues are more
life and death.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.712
It's about some ho?

25:55.746 --> 25:58.715
Man, you know what I do
to get over some bitch?

25:58.749 --> 26:02.452
I listen to three
Too Short songs back to back,

26:02.486 --> 26:04.855
then I take a shot,
and I'm good.

26:04.888 --> 26:06.056
Drink up.

26:06.089 --> 26:08.091
Biatch!

26:08.125 --> 26:10.227
Yeah. Feel better?

26:10.260 --> 26:11.461
Yeah.

26:14.164 --> 26:15.732
Yeah.
Hey, yo, I gotta bounce.

26:15.766 --> 26:16.634
- Okay, man.
- It was great

26:16.668 --> 26:18.402
running into you.
We should catch up soon.

26:18.435 --> 26:21.505
And don't forget to vote
for Tyler Greggs. A'ight?

26:21.538 --> 26:23.407
Okay. Thanks, buddy.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.708
You're welcome.

26:27.277 --> 26:28.345
Peace out, bitches.

26:29.947 --> 26:31.982
Billy back in town.
Good seeing you, Billy.

26:32.015 --> 26:33.217
Okay, man.

26:35.852 --> 26:37.020
You know that piece of shit?

26:38.155 --> 26:40.357
In a former life.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.826
Nobody ever really
gives a shit about a dealer.

26:42.859 --> 26:44.161
Yeah!

26:44.194 --> 26:45.929
But he must have a crush.

26:45.963 --> 26:47.364
Tyler never pays for his drinks

26:47.397 --> 26:49.967
without me threatening
to call the cops.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.336
Can I get another shot
of the "bad man"?

26:52.369 --> 26:53.737
Your wish, Mr. Walker.

26:58.141 --> 27:00.010
Welcome back to the land
of bad decisions.

27:58.235 --> 27:59.403
I swore you were a tweeker.

28:01.238 --> 28:03.373
Thought I liked to take it in the ass?
Huh? You trying to fuck me?

28:04.908 --> 28:06.843
Tyler, man, I'm...

28:06.877 --> 28:08.378
Man, shut the fuck up.

28:08.412 --> 28:10.881
You ain't got shit to say
that I want to hear.

28:10.914 --> 28:13.216
I buy you a drink,
offer my friendship,

28:13.250 --> 28:15.118
give you advice on bitches,

28:15.152 --> 28:16.654
and the first thing
your punk ass thinks is,

28:16.688 --> 28:20.590
"Oh, let me go rob this overly kind
motherfucker that bought me drinks."

28:21.925 --> 28:23.026
Move!

28:23.060 --> 28:24.461
I do my fuckin'
in the livin' room.

28:26.063 --> 28:27.364
Come on, speed it up.

28:28.633 --> 28:30.233
It's all my fault.

28:30.267 --> 28:33.203
Showin' my generosity of spirit
to my fellow man,

28:33.236 --> 28:38.208
have him thinking "Brother Tyler of the
Sisters of Mercy is gonna be easy to fuck."

28:38.241 --> 28:41.011
But my time in the joint
wasn't for slangin', Billy.

28:41.044 --> 28:44.147
It was for aggravated assault.
Big boy shit.

28:44.181 --> 28:46.883
Turns out
violence comes easy to me.

28:46.917 --> 28:48.919
I'm a goddamn virtuoso.

28:48.952 --> 28:50.387
Fucking Yo Yo Ma of pain.

28:53.156 --> 28:56.460
So, you also probably assumed
that this was my pad.

28:56.493 --> 28:59.396
True, I do lay my head
and major pipe here,

28:59.429 --> 29:02.299
talking three to five
bitches a week.

29:02.332 --> 29:05.335
But this is also
a drop house for the cartel.

29:08.138 --> 29:11.174
When you steal
from these motherfuckers,

29:11.208 --> 29:13.210
they take that shit
real personal.

29:14.511 --> 29:16.446
<i>"La Familia" es</i> no joke.

29:20.117 --> 29:22.085
- Yo, it's T.
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

29:22.119 --> 29:23.954
I caught an intruder
in the nest.

29:23.987 --> 29:26.691
<i>Wow, these cowboys,</i>

29:26.724 --> 29:28.125
they're here for one reason.

29:29.326 --> 29:33.997
To make sure that no one ever
fucks with their business.

29:36.299 --> 29:37.668
T, get it done.

29:42.339 --> 29:44.441
Three cowboys are en route.

29:44.474 --> 29:47.210
They live for this shit.
Taking things apart.

29:47.244 --> 29:51.314
Not like cars, I'm talking
people, fingers, toes, dicks,

29:51.348 --> 29:53.483
shit you don't even wanna
know about, Billy.

29:53.517 --> 29:56.586
Man, fuck, I probably just earned
myself a stripe for makin' that call.

29:59.657 --> 30:01.659
Can I have a cigarette?

30:01.692 --> 30:04.094
Wanna know some crazy shit?

30:04.127 --> 30:06.062
I don't smoke.

30:06.096 --> 30:11.268
Hate the smell, taste,
shit burns my lungs.

30:11.301 --> 30:13.236
Not a good thing
in my line of work.

30:13.270 --> 30:16.072
Fools are always tryin' to smoke
when they gettin' blasted.

30:24.014 --> 30:26.383
How about
a fat ass rail instead?

30:26.416 --> 30:27.984
Get you feeling no pain.

30:28.018 --> 30:29.754
Plus, when they gut you,

30:29.787 --> 30:31.455
you'll bleed out
a whole lot faster.

30:33.423 --> 30:34.692
I don't like to party alone.

30:35.793 --> 30:37.728
Do the line,
shit ain't a request.

30:56.313 --> 30:57.547
Yeah, that's the spot.

30:57.581 --> 30:59.216
That's what I was
talkin' about.

30:59.249 --> 31:01.418
That's good?

31:01.451 --> 31:05.155
You wanna know
what I learned in prison?

31:05.188 --> 31:08.358
How to suck a mean cock
and tickle some balls?

31:08.391 --> 31:10.093
How to take
a fucking beatin'.

31:11.729 --> 31:13.263
You fucking dick!

31:14.264 --> 31:15.766
You thought that was
the only gun that I got?

31:17.267 --> 31:18.368
I'm a drug dealer, bitch!

31:25.843 --> 31:27.611
Holy shit, man.

32:04.815 --> 32:05.816
Fuck me!

32:11.756 --> 32:13.323
Fuck you, Tyler.

32:13.356 --> 32:14.692
Fuck me.

32:16.861 --> 32:18.328
Fuck!

32:30.741 --> 32:32.777
<i>There's
some real evil in the world.</i>

32:34.679 --> 32:35.846
<i>pure evil.</i>

32:37.547 --> 32:38.649
<i>I've seen it.</i>

has announced a new association</i>

33:20.891 --> 33:23.259
<i>with the Reynolds
Rehabilitation Ranch.</i>

33:23.293 --> 33:25.495
Nobody gives a shit
about a dealer.

33:25.528 --> 33:26.731
<i>...for the Ranch's efforts</i>

33:26.764 --> 33:28.331
<i>to rehabilitate...</i>

34:12.909 --> 34:14.210
Just the one vic?

34:14.244 --> 34:16.478
Yep.
Shotgun round to the torso.

34:16.513 --> 34:20.685
Less than 15 feet,
and he took off through that door.

34:20.717 --> 34:22.552
Huh. Dealer gets
his ticket punched.

34:25.889 --> 34:27.757
Whose blood is that?

34:27.792 --> 34:29.793
Not our vic's.

34:29.827 --> 34:30.895
We'll test it
and run it through.

34:31.929 --> 34:33.362
Hmm.

34:33.396 --> 34:35.766
Dealer put up a fight.
I'm almost impressed.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.635
As far as I can tell,

34:37.668 --> 34:39.804
this room was trampled
before we even arrived.

34:39.837 --> 34:42.739
Ah, the shooter
went on a shopping spree?

34:42.773 --> 34:44.842
Nah, shooter took off.

34:44.875 --> 34:47.444
Some cowboys paid our vic
a house call after the fact.

34:49.312 --> 34:50.981
<i>Forensics,
can we see you outside?</i>

34:51.014 --> 34:52.750
Cowboys, huh?

34:52.783 --> 34:54.819
Yup. I get to get back
to the station, all right?

34:54.851 --> 34:56.286
Yeah. Sure thing.

35:08.999 --> 35:10.400
Hey there, Bubba.

35:26.083 --> 35:27.417
John?

35:27.450 --> 35:29.419
Hi!

35:29.452 --> 35:31.287
Thanks for the candle.

35:31.321 --> 35:33.657
Uh, how do you know
it was me?

35:33.691 --> 35:35.993
I had a hunch.

35:36.026 --> 35:40.765
Um, listen, I'm gonna do my best
to not mess up the floors again.

35:40.798 --> 35:44.534
Well, don't you make any
promises you can't keep... down.

35:45.736 --> 35:47.337
That is hospital humor.

35:47.370 --> 35:49.807
Ah. You finished now?

35:49.840 --> 35:52.475
I think
you're my last customer. Yep.

35:52.509 --> 35:53.911
Will I see you later?

35:53.944 --> 35:56.412
You planning on breakin'
your promise already?

35:56.446 --> 35:59.850
No, I just thought maybe you'd
like to check on your candle.

35:59.884 --> 36:01.786
Yeah, um,
I'll be back at 6:00.

36:03.419 --> 36:04.487
Oh, okay.

36:04.521 --> 36:07.825
Then maybe I'll wait up for you.

36:07.858 --> 36:09.459
Are you allowed to eat
with the patients?

36:09.492 --> 36:11.427
I make my own rules.

36:11.461 --> 36:12.963
A rebel, I like it.

36:14.497 --> 36:15.699
Well, um...

36:17.001 --> 36:19.837
Yeah, I can only offer you
pudding cups,

36:19.870 --> 36:22.840
but I gotta tell you,
they're pretty tasty.

36:22.873 --> 36:26.977
Well, pudding happens to be
this rebel's favorite food, so.

36:30.413 --> 36:31.481
Here.

36:36.586 --> 36:38.588
I'll see you at 6:00. Huh?

36:38.621 --> 36:39.824
Hmm.

37:03.413 --> 37:05.783
Hmm.
Those for me?

37:05.816 --> 37:08.518
Well, who else?

37:08.551 --> 37:09.854
I don't know.

37:09.887 --> 37:12.488
I was kind of hoping
you met a nice lady friend.

37:12.522 --> 37:13.590
Yeah.

37:15.192 --> 37:17.795
Looks like you
already have an admirer.

37:17.828 --> 37:18.896
Just a buddy.

37:20.064 --> 37:21.497
You know,
they all start out that way.

37:21.531 --> 37:22.800
Hmm, 'kay.
Cute. Enough.

37:25.501 --> 37:26.637
How are you feelin'?

37:26.670 --> 37:29.439
Great.
I get to lay in bed all day

37:29.472 --> 37:31.441
and watch
all my favorite talk shows.

37:31.474 --> 37:32.843
Oh, okay.
Oh, yeah.

37:32.877 --> 37:34.678
Long night huh, buddy?
Bad night.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.815
Slung?

37:37.848 --> 37:39.717
I was job hunting.
It's fine.

37:39.750 --> 37:42.686
- It's nothing.
- Sure.

37:42.720 --> 37:45.122
I'm out of prison,
please stop worrying.

37:45.155 --> 37:47.457
I want you to look
for a job, not trouble.

37:49.994 --> 37:51.962
Trouble tends to find me.

37:51.996 --> 37:53.964
Look, I can call work.

37:53.998 --> 37:56.100
I'm sure there's something
you can do around the office.

37:56.133 --> 37:58.702
Stop. I got it covered.

37:58.736 --> 38:01.571
I swear.
I actually got some leads.

38:03.073 --> 38:05.508
You wanna share,
wanna tell dear old mom?

38:07.244 --> 38:09.579
No.

38:09.612 --> 38:11.682
I don't want to
jinx it, you know.

38:11.715 --> 38:12.917
Of course not.

38:12.950 --> 38:14.685
Give me my purse.

38:16.987 --> 38:19.023
Here.

38:19.056 --> 38:21.792
Here's my phone. Take it.

38:21.825 --> 38:24.494
And my car keys.

38:24.527 --> 38:26.931
Now, go make nice
with the pretty ladies.

38:26.964 --> 38:31.601
Okay.
Thank you.

38:32.736 --> 38:33.971
No more fighting.

38:51.021 --> 38:54.158
Your goddamn cowboy boots
were all over the house.

38:54.191 --> 38:55.525
Is that all you guys wear?

39:00.798 --> 39:03.901
Look, tell Reynolds
I'm all over this asshole.

39:03.934 --> 39:05.703
All right?
He'll make a mistake.

39:07.905 --> 39:08.973
Adi-fucking-os.

39:27.224 --> 39:29.193
Guessing last
night ended badly?

39:29.226 --> 39:30.894
Oh, I fell.

39:30.928 --> 39:31.929
Yeah, right.

39:33.563 --> 39:35.232
Must not have ended too badly.

39:35.265 --> 39:37.935
I'm back for more punishment.

39:37.968 --> 39:39.502
Any luck with the 9:00 to 5:00?

39:40.804 --> 39:42.306
Not yet.

39:42.339 --> 39:43.841
It'll work out.

39:43.874 --> 39:46.010
Somehow it always does.

39:46.043 --> 39:47.044
Yeah.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.982
Hey, Tex.

39:52.016 --> 39:53.784
You seen the Nitwit today?

39:53.817 --> 39:56.286
Tyler? No, haven't
had the pleasure.

39:56.320 --> 39:57.688
Fuck.

39:59.189 --> 40:01.291
Want me to give him a message
when he turns up?

40:01.325 --> 40:04.762
Yeah.
Tell his ass to call me.

40:04.795 --> 40:06.897
Dumb shit's voicemail is full.

40:15.105 --> 40:16.807
Can I help you, faggot?

40:19.043 --> 40:20.277
No.

40:37.728 --> 40:38.862
Wow.

40:39.263 --> 40:40.330
Ex-boyfriend?

40:42.299 --> 40:43.934
Think Tyler's bad news?

40:43.967 --> 40:46.103
That guy's the worst news
you could possibly get.

40:47.237 --> 40:48.705
Dealer?

40:48.739 --> 40:50.741
A wanna be pimp.

40:50.774 --> 40:53.877
Gets his customers from
the strip club he bounces at.

40:53.911 --> 40:56.180
Glad you don't know Tex.

40:56.213 --> 40:59.615
Yeah, I mean,
I am one of the good guys.

40:59.650 --> 41:01.584
Huh! In my bar?

41:50.734 --> 41:52.870
Chocolate is the best.

41:52.903 --> 41:54.037
Without question.

41:55.973 --> 41:58.175
So, what do you like to do
when you're not working?

41:59.409 --> 42:01.111
Getting
to the nitty gritty, huh?

42:01.145 --> 42:02.779
Well, I don't have
a lot of time left here.

42:02.813 --> 42:04.781
No, don't say that.

42:04.815 --> 42:06.250
It's a joke.

42:06.283 --> 42:07.718
Ha ha.

42:07.751 --> 42:09.153
- Patient humor.
- Okay.

42:09.186 --> 42:13.891
What do I do? I, uh...
I have an apartment.

42:13.924 --> 42:18.996
I, um, I work on my car.
'67 Firebird, classic.

42:19.029 --> 42:22.866
To me anyway, and, uh,
well, that's...

42:22.900 --> 42:25.869
Well, sometimes
I go to church.

42:25.903 --> 42:27.971
Oh!

42:28.005 --> 42:30.040
Only people I ever knew
that went to church

42:30.073 --> 42:37.047
were nuns, or folks
searching to pray their way

42:37.080 --> 42:39.850
out of something
terrible in life.

42:39.883 --> 42:41.785
Well, you got me again.

42:41.818 --> 42:42.886
I'm a nun.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.054
I knew it was something.

42:45.255 --> 42:47.057
I used to be a doctor.

42:51.461 --> 42:57.201
Then some years ago, my,
um, my life just unraveled.

42:57.234 --> 43:02.806
I mean, it was coming apart
before, but I didn't see it.

43:02.839 --> 43:04.875
I was blinded
by my own magnificence.

43:04.908 --> 43:07.010
Hmm. Yeah.

43:10.847 --> 43:13.884
In the end,
I trashed everything,

43:13.917 --> 43:18.322
everybody, my family,
my practice, my friendships.

43:20.157 --> 43:21.959
I burned it.

43:21.992 --> 43:23.026
All of it.

43:24.361 --> 43:27.431
And, uh, my life dead ended.

43:30.567 --> 43:31.802
I'm sorry.

43:33.570 --> 43:36.373
I am, too.

43:36.406 --> 43:38.909
I think that sorry
sorrow

43:40.811 --> 43:45.782
it's the color of my life,
whatever color sorrow is.

43:48.085 --> 43:53.924
But my car, on the other hand,
is red, and, uh, I think,

43:53.957 --> 43:56.159
uh, maybe that's
why I work on it.

43:56.193 --> 44:01.398
I'm trying to get back to that,
you know, life.

44:04.368 --> 44:05.969
There are days, lot of days,

44:06.003 --> 44:11.441
when I don't feel that life

44:11.475 --> 44:15.012
is really
an available option.

44:18.115 --> 44:19.182
You feel that way now?

44:21.885 --> 44:28.558
Now, right now,
I feel. exposed.

44:31.128 --> 44:34.031
You're the most vulnerable man
I've ever seen.

44:35.999 --> 44:37.534
It's rare.

44:37.567 --> 44:39.236
I think you mean weak.

44:39.269 --> 44:42.406
No, no.
They're... they're...

44:42.439 --> 44:47.177
They're usually just.
stupid little boys with anger issues,

44:47.210 --> 44:52.382
but I've never seen a man
be more of a man

44:52.416 --> 44:54.251
than the man you are now.

44:56.553 --> 45:02.159
I take it you go
for the sensitive type, huh?

45:02.192 --> 45:05.095
No, it's just... it's just...

45:05.128 --> 45:08.999
Well, you remind me of my son
when he was younger.

45:09.032 --> 45:11.001
- You have a son?
- I do.

45:12.637 --> 45:15.172
I'd really like you
to meet him someday.

45:15.205 --> 45:17.341
Okay.

45:17.374 --> 45:18.875
Let's make a date.

45:21.144 --> 45:23.413
Ooh!

45:23.447 --> 45:24.548
A date.

46:34.551 --> 46:35.686
Looks like
you're keeping busy.

46:39.256 --> 46:40.557
You were
at my parole hearing.

46:41.992 --> 46:43.560
I'm your PO, Sarah Jenson.

46:46.096 --> 46:48.231
Am I in trouble?

46:48.265 --> 46:50.400
Why do you ask that?

46:50.434 --> 46:52.637
Well, you're standing
in my driveway.

46:55.138 --> 46:56.239
Is your mom around?

46:56.273 --> 46:57.541
I'd like to talk to her.

47:01.077 --> 47:02.612
She's the reason
I got out, isn't she?

47:04.514 --> 47:08.985
She came to me,
told me about her condition.

47:09.019 --> 47:10.755
I'm a mother, too.

47:10.788 --> 47:12.723
She never said anything.

47:12.757 --> 47:16.059
Well, she kept on top of me.

47:16.092 --> 47:18.028
Had me take
a second look at your case.

47:20.363 --> 47:21.398
Your mom?

47:23.166 --> 47:25.235
She's at El Paso General.

47:25.268 --> 47:26.303
I'm sorry to hear that.

47:28.739 --> 47:31.141
Come by my office next week.

47:31.174 --> 47:32.175
You find a job yet?

47:34.211 --> 47:35.545
Not for lack of trying.

47:35.579 --> 47:36.580
Get one.

48:09.780 --> 48:11.581
I know what you're gonna say.

48:11.615 --> 48:12.650
Fuck!

48:14.217 --> 48:15.352
This is a burrito.

48:15.385 --> 48:18.789
I ask for a special kind of
burrito every fucking day.

48:18.823 --> 48:21.358
Peanut butter,
jelly, mayonnaise,

48:21.391 --> 48:24.160
and they fill it with some kind
of egg shit and somethin' else.

48:25.696 --> 48:28.699
And then they expect me
to eat it? No way.

48:28.733 --> 48:30.333
I try to avoid 'em myself.

48:32.435 --> 48:36.273
You know why you and I
never met face to face before?

48:36.306 --> 48:38.275
I have a pretty good idea.

48:39.409 --> 48:43.179
I hate pigs,
especially dirty ones.

48:43.213 --> 48:46.082
You look around
this whole ranch.

48:46.116 --> 48:49.286
Take a look, 30,000 acres.

48:50.554 --> 48:54.224
Not one fucking pig.

48:54.257 --> 48:57.728
As soon as I get a DNA hit,
I'll deliver this fucking guy to you.

48:57.762 --> 48:59.462
All right?

48:59.496 --> 49:02.132
Uh, not right.

49:02.165 --> 49:04.367
I'm supposed to
just sit around here,

49:04.401 --> 49:06.202
enjoy a piece of shit burrito
and relax?

49:06.236 --> 49:09.506
You know that's not all I'm
doing, you know. I'm on it.

49:09.539 --> 49:11.575
Really?
And yet, here we are?

49:11.608 --> 49:14.110
Listen,
this isn't even my case.

49:14.144 --> 49:16.714
I start I start making waves,
they're gonna start looking at me.

49:16.747 --> 49:19.182
Who's on the case
if it's not you?

49:19.215 --> 49:21.518
Ah! With all your connections.

49:22.787 --> 49:24.387
What is that?
An insult?

49:26.156 --> 49:27.858
You know who
you're looking at?

49:27.892 --> 49:31.361
Seven fucking generations
on this property

49:31.394 --> 49:33.496
my blood, my people.

49:36.834 --> 49:38.168
I mean something.

49:38.201 --> 49:41.338
Well, it still doesn't give you
the right to start killing cops.

49:43.573 --> 49:44.574
Really?

49:45.710 --> 49:47.177
Yeah.

49:58.789 --> 50:03.426
And I always save one in case
I need to make a point.

50:07.464 --> 50:09.532
You got that?

50:09.566 --> 50:12.402
My patience is gone.

50:12.435 --> 50:14.237
Two dealers are dead.

50:14.270 --> 50:16.907
The money's missing.

50:16.941 --> 50:23.513
Now if these Mexicans
get wind of all this,

50:23.546 --> 50:25.883
there's gonna be a gun
to everybody's fucking head.

50:27.818 --> 50:31.254
So, I suggest

50:31.287 --> 50:36.694
you find the fuck who is
messing with my business,

50:36.727 --> 50:38.896
and you do it quickly.

50:39.897 --> 50:41.398
Yeah.

50:41.431 --> 50:48.873
<i>Plata o plomo.</i>
Means silver or lead.

50:48.906 --> 50:50.775
Why don't you just say it
in English next time?

50:50.808 --> 50:54.277
Well, next time I'll just put
a bullet in your fucking brain.

50:54.310 --> 50:56.647
Now why don't you turn around
and stumble out of here?

51:00.283 --> 51:01.384
Prick.

51:15.565 --> 51:17.333
No shot, Mr. Walker?

51:17.367 --> 51:19.569
Oh, I'm staying off
the hard stuff tonight.

51:23.641 --> 51:26.376
White iPhone,
it's an interesting choice.

51:26.409 --> 51:29.947
It's my mom's.

51:29.980 --> 51:32.449
She doesn't need it?

51:32.482 --> 51:36.921
No, it's just she's, um,
resting comfortably at EP General.

51:38.756 --> 51:41.324
She's having issues
with her liver.

51:41.357 --> 51:42.492
I'm sorry.

51:42.525 --> 51:44.494
It's okay.

51:44.527 --> 51:47.297
And yet, here I am,
drinking beer.

51:47.330 --> 51:48.999
Maybe I'll win son of the year.

51:49.033 --> 51:52.837
I'm sure she wouldn't
mind you keeping me company.

51:52.870 --> 51:55.572
Besides, you can't visit her
over there late night anyway.

51:57.440 --> 52:00.911
Tsk. Well, she did say
that I needed to get out more.

52:00.945 --> 52:02.012
Meet new people.

52:04.547 --> 52:05.883
Billy!

52:06.483 --> 52:08.753
Sorry about the job, dude.

52:08.786 --> 52:11.321
Maybe if you hadn't
just gotten out.

52:11.354 --> 52:13.590
Gotten out? As in jail?

52:15.025 --> 52:17.762
Why didn't you tell me?

52:17.795 --> 52:19.697
Well, it's not
the greatest icebreaker.

52:26.637 --> 52:28.404
What'd he go to jail for?

52:31.842 --> 52:33.409
It was messed up.

52:33.443 --> 52:35.813
He stopped this guy
beating his mom at Geno's.

52:35.846 --> 52:37.848
How's that a crime?

52:37.882 --> 52:38.949
He killed the guy.

52:41.018 --> 52:42.720
Must have been
a nightmare for him.

52:44.088 --> 52:46.322
Now his mom's dying
over at EP General.

52:46.356 --> 52:47.825
Yeah, Grace Andrews.

52:50.661 --> 52:53.931
Oh, well. You seen Tyler?

52:53.964 --> 52:56.066
No, not lately.

52:56.100 --> 52:58.434
He's not returning my text.
That's weird.

53:04.775 --> 53:06.977
What the hell
are they doing here?

53:07.011 --> 53:09.814
I have a feeling they're looking
for the same guy you are.

53:13.984 --> 53:15.618
Kevin told you?

53:15.653 --> 53:16.787
Damn it.

53:18.488 --> 53:19.957
I didn't mean to scare you.

53:19.990 --> 53:21.324
What are you
doing out here, Billy?

53:23.160 --> 53:25.663
I left so quickly today.

53:25.696 --> 53:27.798
You're making a habit of that.

53:27.832 --> 53:29.399
Tsk. Ah, fuck!
I don't know.

53:31.035 --> 53:32.468
You don't owe me anything.

53:36.573 --> 53:38.976
You know, I told myself
that I wouldn't drink anymore,

53:39.009 --> 53:40.644
because I was drunk that night.

53:44.048 --> 53:45.983
I just did. I...

53:50.921 --> 53:55.458
<i>I flipped when I saw
this man hit my mother.</i>

53:57.161 --> 53:58.461
I saw red.

53:59.964 --> 54:02.032
- Let go. Let go.
- I ain't done with you yet!

54:02.066 --> 54:03.399
Hey!

54:05.870 --> 54:07.104
<i>I couldn't stop myself.</i>

54:08.706 --> 54:10.908
Billy, don't.

54:10.941 --> 54:12.676
Billy. Billy. Billy.
Billy, don't.

54:12.710 --> 54:16.814
No, no, no. No, Billy.
No, Billy.

54:16.847 --> 54:18.615
No, Billy.
Billy, Billy.

54:35.199 --> 54:38.969
I did seven years.

54:39.003 --> 54:41.038
Seven years for a life.

54:41.071 --> 54:43.707
I don't even know
how that math works out. I...

54:43.741 --> 54:46.542
Billy, don't. Don't.

54:52.216 --> 54:54.550
You wanna know
the worst lie you can tell?

54:54.584 --> 54:55.618
What?

54:57.487 --> 54:59.555
It's the one
you tell yourself.

55:02.893 --> 55:04.995
Grace raised you right.

55:05.029 --> 55:06.163
Why do you say that?

55:13.170 --> 55:15.139
You didn't try to kiss me
in the parking lot.

55:30.054 --> 55:31.822
You know I can
see you out there, right?

55:38.729 --> 55:40.164
Hah.

55:40.197 --> 55:42.700
Huh?
Getting sick of me already?

55:42.733 --> 55:46.670
No. No, I just thought...
I don't know.

55:46.704 --> 55:50.774
Maybe I said
too much last night.

55:50.808 --> 55:53.277
Oh, don't be
so hard on yourself.

55:53.310 --> 55:54.945
All right.

55:54.979 --> 55:56.180
You know you're not the first
person to tell me that.

55:56.213 --> 55:58.182
I'm sure I'm not.

55:58.215 --> 55:59.850
Sweet man like you.

56:01.852 --> 56:03.153
Gosh, you're cute.

56:03.187 --> 56:05.521
No, no, no.

56:05.555 --> 56:09.193
Maybe when I was younger,
or from the creepy guy

56:09.226 --> 56:12.696
that used to follow me around
in the grocery store...

56:12.730 --> 56:16.000
But when it came time to make
smart decisions in my life,

56:16.033 --> 56:18.501
or make decisions about men,

56:19.203 --> 56:22.006
that was never cute.

56:23.340 --> 56:25.209
Hey, you tell yourself
it's just this once.

56:25.242 --> 56:27.811
It's never gonna happen again.

56:27.845 --> 56:30.214
And it happens again.

56:30.247 --> 56:32.582
You know, I can get him
to stop drinking and...

56:32.615 --> 56:33.784
Grace, all I was trying to...

56:33.817 --> 56:35.986
No, no.
It just makes things worse

56:36.020 --> 56:40.157
and every man sizes me up
in two seconds.

56:40.190 --> 56:42.026
They know
everything about me

56:42.059 --> 56:44.828
before they even
finish their beer.

56:44.862 --> 56:47.765
You know, it sometimes,
it really does change a little.

56:47.798 --> 56:53.270
No, a... a lot, and you just
become completely disconnected

56:53.303 --> 56:56.340
to this crappy, crappy,

56:56.373 --> 57:01.078
just reality
that you're just stuck in.

57:01.111 --> 57:05.182
Zero, zero control.

57:05.215 --> 57:10.054
All just because
you foolishly gave it away.

57:10.087 --> 57:11.922
I didn't
mean to stir things up.

57:11.955 --> 57:14.658
No, no, no.
Just the opposite.

57:14.691 --> 57:15.993
Just the opposite.

57:24.034 --> 57:25.235
You are...

57:29.039 --> 57:34.845
the only man that has made me
feel cute in a really long time.

57:36.880 --> 57:37.915
Hey.

57:44.755 --> 57:46.957
Hey. What happened
to your forehead?

57:47.958 --> 57:49.927
Hunting accident.

57:49.960 --> 57:51.161
You guys got cameras?

57:53.197 --> 57:55.165
Can't be too careful.

57:55.199 --> 57:56.733
Mind if I check the tapes?

58:01.205 --> 58:02.272
Ask for Mike.

58:05.342 --> 58:06.609
<i>You look awful.</i>

58:08.078 --> 58:10.114
I'm supposed to be
the only one sick in here.

58:12.683 --> 58:16.153
Hey, they're going to get
you one real soon. Okay?

58:16.186 --> 58:17.821
I promise you that.

58:19.857 --> 58:22.893
Well, I wish
I shared your optimism.

58:22.926 --> 58:26.663
The nurses keep just looking
at me like I'm a lost cause.

58:28.699 --> 58:29.800
You want me to talk to 'em?

58:29.833 --> 58:30.901
No, I have a bodyguard.

58:33.003 --> 58:35.105
Really?
Mr. Candle Man?

58:35.139 --> 58:36.206
His name is John.

58:38.108 --> 58:40.210
Is he the reason
for that smile you're wearing?

58:41.979 --> 58:44.448
Well, he is the only man

58:44.481 --> 58:47.918
that doesn't look at me
like just a piece of beef.

58:47.951 --> 58:49.987
Mm. Maybe he's a vegetarian.

58:50.020 --> 58:51.455
Maybe you're an asshole.

58:53.257 --> 58:54.892
Well, I am the son.
That is my role.

58:56.260 --> 58:58.195
Speak of the devil.

58:58.228 --> 59:00.764
John, this is my son.

59:06.136 --> 59:07.404
Billy Walker.

59:11.308 --> 59:12.376
How do you know that?

59:15.913 --> 59:17.080
Mr. Schofield?

59:19.116 --> 59:20.150
Schofield?

59:25.055 --> 59:28.458
John, I did not know.

59:28.492 --> 59:30.060
That your son murdered mine?

59:36.800 --> 59:38.769
I got remarried
after I had Billy.

59:45.275 --> 59:46.944
John, please.

59:48.312 --> 59:49.479
Please.

59:55.886 --> 59:57.020
- John?
- No.

59:57.054 --> 59:58.789
There's... there's
nothing more to say.

59:58.822 --> 01:00:01.858
John. Please, John.
I didn't know.

01:00:01.892 --> 01:00:03.527
I didn't know.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.495
I didn't know. John.

01:00:17.574 --> 01:00:20.043
J.W., I got to hit on your DNA.

01:00:21.945 --> 01:00:23.847
He was already in the system.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.450
Walker. Billy. 37.

01:00:26.483 --> 01:00:29.286
Ah. Fresh out of the box.

01:00:29.319 --> 01:00:31.455
Can you give the info
to Somerset when you're finished?

01:00:31.488 --> 01:00:32.889
Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:35.826 --> 01:00:37.127
Gold Malibu.

01:00:38.895 --> 01:00:39.963
Gold Malibu.

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:48.772
Hey there, Bubba.

01:01:18.636 --> 01:01:20.570
That's four.

01:01:20.604 --> 01:01:21.972
You looking to set a record?

01:01:22.005 --> 01:01:25.309
Oh no, I just need
a little liquid courage.

01:01:25.342 --> 01:01:26.410
For what?

01:01:28.912 --> 01:01:29.980
How's your mom doing?

01:01:31.948 --> 01:01:34.418
I don't ask.
You don't wanna know.

01:01:37.187 --> 01:01:39.289
No more shots.

01:01:39.323 --> 01:01:40.991
I've got a better idea.

01:01:47.564 --> 01:01:50.367
Jen, beer me.

01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:54.404
Asshole duty calls.

01:01:59.476 --> 01:02:01.578
You seen Tyler?

01:02:01.611 --> 01:02:04.147
Why the fuck
would I have seen him?

01:02:04.181 --> 01:02:06.116
You shouldn't be drinking, bro.

01:02:06.149 --> 01:02:08.318
- You're on parole.
- Fuck you.

01:02:08.352 --> 01:02:10.187
Stop. Stop.

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:12.022
Are you guys
dating now or what?

01:02:12.055 --> 01:02:13.290
You need to go!

01:02:14.324 --> 01:02:15.425
Bro, I didn't mean to...

01:02:15.459 --> 01:02:16.694
Blow my shit
out of the water?

01:02:16.728 --> 01:02:20.197
Why don't you take your daddy's
money and fuck off, huh?

01:02:21.598 --> 01:02:23.233
- Fuck you!
- Stop. Stop.

01:02:23.266 --> 01:02:25.001
Hey.

01:02:25.035 --> 01:02:26.336
You wanna go back to jail?

01:02:29.206 --> 01:02:30.440
You know what, Jen?

01:02:30.474 --> 01:02:32.309
Good luck dating that guy.

01:02:33.243 --> 01:02:34.945
Got any more advice for me?

01:02:41.385 --> 01:02:44.287
- Yeah.
- <i>Billy, it's Sarah, your P.O.</i>

01:02:44.321 --> 01:02:46.923
- <i>How's the job search going?</i>
- It's not.

01:03:24.194 --> 01:03:25.362
Fuck!

01:04:09.774 --> 01:04:11.408
I heard you boys
are looking for me.

01:04:16.179 --> 01:04:17.280
Well, here I am.

01:04:20.484 --> 01:04:23.153
Goddamn it!

01:04:23.186 --> 01:04:26.156
Motherfucker!

01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:30.327
Ah, fuck!

01:04:33.798 --> 01:04:35.265
I'm gonna kill you.
You mother...

01:04:37.133 --> 01:04:41.238
You are my sunshine.

01:04:41.271 --> 01:04:44.040
My only sunshine.

01:04:45.308 --> 01:04:50.247
You make me happy
when skies are gray.

01:04:52.249 --> 01:04:57.020
But you never heard me
when I said I love you.

01:04:59.122 --> 01:05:01.458
Please don't take
my sunshine away.

01:05:06.096 --> 01:05:07.297
Where's my money?

01:05:11.101 --> 01:05:12.569
I know you hear me.

01:05:18.308 --> 01:05:19.543
What the fuck, man?

01:05:22.145 --> 01:05:26.283
I can't help but imagine

01:05:26.316 --> 01:05:28.653
when all this
began in your mind.

01:05:30.487 --> 01:05:32.322
You didn't think
your life would end up

01:05:32.355 --> 01:05:34.324
in a fucking slaughterhouse,
did you?

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.664
Stealing from me
means you also stole

01:05:39.697 --> 01:05:41.565
from some rough fucking people.

01:05:44.869 --> 01:05:46.603
Don't do this.

01:05:46.637 --> 01:05:48.171
And the Cowboys?

01:05:48.204 --> 01:05:49.272
There's no sense
pleading with 'em.

01:05:51.575 --> 01:05:53.844
I'm sure you get that.

01:05:53.878 --> 01:05:58.749
So, you got one choice,
and it's simple.

01:05:59.215 --> 01:06:00.517
Where's my money?

01:06:04.187 --> 01:06:08.458
Fuck you.

01:06:08.491 --> 01:06:10.795
You brought it on yourself.

01:06:10.828 --> 01:06:12.395
Let's do it.

01:06:17.467 --> 01:06:20.170
Hey, hey.

01:06:36.721 --> 01:06:39.890
Now, son,
look me in the eye.

01:06:43.259 --> 01:06:45.228
Where's my money?

01:06:46.596 --> 01:06:48.933
When I first went to prison,

01:06:48.966 --> 01:06:50.300
I thought it was tough,

01:06:53.536 --> 01:06:55.873
but these guys
were fucking maniacs.

01:06:55.906 --> 01:06:59.810
So I took my beatings.

01:07:01.211 --> 01:07:03.313
Real fucked up shit.

01:07:07.384 --> 01:07:08.853
But after a couple years,

01:07:10.888 --> 01:07:13.423
I actually
started to enjoy it.

01:07:13.456 --> 01:07:17.627
I gotta tell you.

01:07:17.662 --> 01:07:20.698
That does not bode well for you.

01:07:20.731 --> 01:07:24.267
And just why might that be?

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:26.403
Because
when I get out of here,

01:07:26.436 --> 01:07:29.239
I'm going to
take my left thumb,

01:07:29.272 --> 01:07:31.574
and I'm going to gouge out
your left eyeball with it.

01:07:34.712 --> 01:07:38.949
You are more full of shit
than a Christmas turkey.

01:07:38.983 --> 01:07:41.752
That was the incorrect answer.

01:07:41.786 --> 01:07:44.354
<i>Senores,</i>
cut off his left thumb.

01:07:57.333 --> 01:07:59.269
Where's my money?

01:07:59.302 --> 01:08:01.672
I spent it all
saving someone.

01:08:03.339 --> 01:08:06.744
Is that worth
your life, asshole?

01:08:06.777 --> 01:08:08.411
Alive!

01:08:20.323 --> 01:08:22.392
Your turn.
Where's the money?

01:08:22.425 --> 01:08:23.961
Fuck you.

01:08:23.993 --> 01:08:26.731
That is the incorrect answer.

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:34.805
Twenty three.

01:08:51.453 --> 01:08:54.323
Now I guess you'll kill me?
Is that your plan?

01:09:02.066 --> 01:09:03.332
I'm not a bad guy.

01:09:06.603 --> 01:09:09.740
But sometimes we do
fucked up shit in this world.

01:09:09.774 --> 01:09:11.675
Like stealing my money?

01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:14.277
Yeah.

01:09:18.682 --> 01:09:20.785
They can take you
stealing my money,

01:09:20.818 --> 01:09:23.020
but you're not gonna get far.

01:09:24.354 --> 01:09:26.991
Because I will hunt you down.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.656
Hey, Doc.

01:10:00.825 --> 01:10:02.092
What the hell
happened to you?

01:10:05.863 --> 01:10:07.898
I got your money.

01:10:13.503 --> 01:10:15.139
Welcome back.

01:10:15.172 --> 01:10:17.708
Half hour more,
you would have bled out.

01:10:17.741 --> 01:10:19.710
Oh, man.
I don't give a fuck about me.

01:10:21.879 --> 01:10:23.413
When can my mom get her liver?

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.689
You can't be this stupid.

01:10:31.722 --> 01:10:32.957
Whoever you stole
this money from

01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:34.692
will come looking for it.

01:10:34.725 --> 01:10:36.093
So, bury my file.

01:10:36.126 --> 01:10:39.096
No, I... I can't.
You were admitted.

01:10:39.129 --> 01:10:41.431
Eventually this all
leads back to my door,

01:10:41.464 --> 01:10:42.800
and I didn't go through
eight years of medical school

01:10:42.833 --> 01:10:44.969
to end up with my head
in a fucking ditch.

01:10:46.036 --> 01:10:47.638
Are you done lecturing me?

01:10:47.671 --> 01:10:51.541
Billy, I got
your Mom's enzyme test back.

01:10:51.574 --> 01:10:54.144
She's only got
a few weeks left.

01:10:54.178 --> 01:10:55.511
Even if I took your money,

01:10:55.545 --> 01:10:57.547
my guy can't get
a liver in time.

01:10:58.749 --> 01:11:00.084
God...

01:11:00.885 --> 01:11:02.887
Save the tough guy act,
all right?

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.922
You're only alive right now
because of me.

01:11:09.693 --> 01:11:11.628
Do you know what I had to do
to get that money?

01:11:11.662 --> 01:11:14.098
Stop talking.

01:11:14.131 --> 01:11:17.101
If you stole this cash from
who I think you stole it from,

01:11:17.134 --> 01:11:20.436
my guy works
for the same people.

01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:22.472
They have eyes everywhere.

01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:40.691
Yes.

01:11:41.926 --> 01:11:45.062
Yes, the same guy.

01:11:45.095 --> 01:11:48.933
He's the guy that shot up your
cowboys and killed my dealers.

01:11:48.966 --> 01:11:52.036
Yes, it's the same
goddamn guy!

01:11:52.069 --> 01:11:53.070
I'm telling you that
right now

01:11:53.103 --> 01:11:56.173
and those guys had been
with me for a long time.

01:11:57.708 --> 01:11:59.609
I want you to do one thing.

01:12:00.177 --> 01:12:02.445
I want that kid dead.

01:12:03.781 --> 01:12:05.149
You understand me?

01:12:07.017 --> 01:12:08.451
Yeah, send the bus. Good.

01:12:15.025 --> 01:12:16.093
Fuck!

01:12:28.906 --> 01:12:31.008
What happened?

01:12:31.041 --> 01:12:33.110
This is the face
of a working man.

01:12:34.544 --> 01:12:35.846
Quit lying, Billy.

01:12:39.817 --> 01:12:40.918
Okay.

01:12:42.853 --> 01:12:46.757
No more lies,
but you got to do me a favor.

01:12:47.557 --> 01:12:48.759
Anything.

01:12:50.995 --> 01:12:53.230
I need you to hang on.
Okay?

01:12:53.263 --> 01:12:55.632
You're so close.
You're so close.

01:12:55.666 --> 01:12:57.167
Mm. Billy.

01:12:57.201 --> 01:12:59.103
Sometimes things
just don't work out

01:12:59.136 --> 01:13:01.504
the way you want them to.

01:13:04.574 --> 01:13:09.213
Mr... Mr. Schofield was
treating you right, wasn't he?

01:13:09.246 --> 01:13:10.681
It wasn't your fault.

01:13:12.683 --> 01:13:14.218
Mom?

01:13:14.251 --> 01:13:17.087
Mom, he was a long term
kind of guy, right?

01:13:17.121 --> 01:13:21.792
I'm not gonna spend the rest
of my time on "what ifs".

01:13:26.096 --> 01:13:27.297
Hey, Mama?

01:13:27.331 --> 01:13:30.167
Mama.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.268
I'm here.

01:13:31.301 --> 01:13:32.836
Okay.

01:13:33.603 --> 01:13:35.839
Go get cleaned up.

01:13:35.873 --> 01:13:37.841
I'm not going anywhere
right now.

01:13:38.275 --> 01:13:39.743
I'm right here.

01:13:54.158 --> 01:13:55.159
Hey there, Bubba.

01:13:56.393 --> 01:13:57.661
Yo.

01:14:03.167 --> 01:14:04.368
You've been
a busy little beaver

01:14:04.401 --> 01:14:06.303
since you got out of the joint,
ain't you?

01:14:08.372 --> 01:14:11.375
Don't make me ask you
again, goddamn it.

01:14:11.408 --> 01:14:13.010
I ain't got all fucking day.

01:14:44.942 --> 01:14:47.311
You know,
for what it's worth,

01:14:47.344 --> 01:14:49.146
I did it for my mom.

01:14:51.048 --> 01:14:53.917
My question is,
what made you think

01:14:53.951 --> 01:14:55.618
robbing the cartel
could save her?

01:14:57.788 --> 01:15:00.290
She needs a new liver.

01:15:00.324 --> 01:15:02.625
I found out a 160 grand
would get her new one.

01:15:04.795 --> 01:15:08.198
Oh, shit.
I feel your pain, kid.

01:15:08.232 --> 01:15:09.766
I got my own money problems.

01:15:14.371 --> 01:15:15.639
Hold it.

01:15:18.342 --> 01:15:19.409
Turn around.

01:15:23.013 --> 01:15:24.314
Get on your fucking knees.

01:15:28.952 --> 01:15:33.190
One question.
What was in Tyler's house?

01:15:35.292 --> 01:15:36.393
Girls.

01:15:37.828 --> 01:15:40.164
Young. Scared. Tied up.

01:15:42.132 --> 01:15:43.267
I let 'em go.

01:15:44.768 --> 01:15:45.936
Why?

01:15:47.004 --> 01:15:48.105
Why?

01:15:50.274 --> 01:15:51.375
It's the right thing to do.

01:16:05.422 --> 01:16:06.723
You're gonna die, kid.

01:16:08.458 --> 01:16:11.228
But it doesn't mean I have to be
the one that pulls the trigger.

01:16:14.364 --> 01:16:17.367
But Reynolds
and those cowboys,

01:16:19.102 --> 01:16:22.005
they'll hunt you down
and find you

01:16:22.039 --> 01:16:23.941
as sure as I'm standing here.

01:16:26.977 --> 01:16:28.779
Get out of El Paso, kid.

01:16:29.947 --> 01:16:31.782
Keep runnin'
and don't look back.

01:17:12.222 --> 01:17:17.394
This piece of shit has a name.
Billy Walker.

01:17:20.464 --> 01:17:23.200
And I want you to
educate him about pain.

01:17:47.891 --> 01:17:49.893
Mr. Schofield.

01:17:52.195 --> 01:17:53.830
You don't belong in here.

01:17:55.265 --> 01:17:56.466
This is the Lord's house.

01:18:02.139 --> 01:18:04.841
Not a second goes by where I
don't think about your boy.

01:18:04.875 --> 01:18:07.110
Don't you dare.

01:18:07.144 --> 01:18:09.880
Don't you dare stand there
and justify it.

01:18:09.913 --> 01:18:12.115
Not to me. Not ever.

01:18:12.849 --> 01:18:14.518
Nothing I'll say
could do that.

01:18:14.551 --> 01:18:15.787
What do you want?

01:18:18.955 --> 01:18:20.357
I need a favor.

01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:22.592
What? You want a favor!

01:18:22.626 --> 01:18:24.027
- A favor from me, huh?
- John!

01:18:24.061 --> 01:18:26.496
- Huh! How about...
- Let go of him right now!

01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:28.899
This is the bastard
who destroyed my life.

01:18:28.932 --> 01:18:30.033
Take it outside.

01:18:30.067 --> 01:18:31.636
I will not have violence
in my church.

01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:34.639
Now go. Please.
Just leave. Go, go.

01:18:34.672 --> 01:18:36.573
Come, John. Sit, please.

01:18:38.308 --> 01:18:39.443
Come on.

01:18:39.476 --> 01:18:42.412
- I'm sorry.
- I know. I know.

01:18:42.446 --> 01:18:43.547
Sit down. Sit down.

01:18:48.618 --> 01:18:50.153
<i>Hey, Mr. Walker.</i>

01:18:50.187 --> 01:18:52.322
You need to call me back
right now.

01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:09.005
Hey, I need an APB on Billy.

01:19:11.308 --> 01:19:13.377
You're not the mom.

01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:15.212
No, I'm the cop.

01:19:16.113 --> 01:19:18.683
Really?

01:19:18.716 --> 01:19:21.151
Is there something
I can help you boys with?

01:19:21.184 --> 01:19:23.019
Not really.

01:19:23.053 --> 01:19:25.122
I'm just a guy
who always felt that...

01:19:29.593 --> 01:19:31.361
cops get in the way.

01:19:35.132 --> 01:19:37.534
They warned me
don't ever kill a cop.

01:19:39.236 --> 01:19:42.239
Well, my patience has worn out,
and you're in the way.

01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:47.043
Now, you're not in the way,

01:19:47.077 --> 01:19:48.378
and that's enough of that.

01:20:00.758 --> 01:20:03.226
Just hear me out, please.

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:05.529
No, I don't want to hear it.

01:20:05.562 --> 01:20:07.130
Boy, you got some balls.

01:20:08.766 --> 01:20:11.601
What you come here what?
Looking for forgiveness?

01:20:11.636 --> 01:20:13.303
Yeah, fine. Go on in.
Fall on your knees,

01:20:13.336 --> 01:20:15.372
but you're not
going to get it from me.

01:20:15.405 --> 01:20:16.473
Take care of my mother.

01:20:19.409 --> 01:20:20.510
What?

01:20:22.379 --> 01:20:25.081
She never did
anything wrong, man.

01:20:25.115 --> 01:20:27.217
Only mistake she ever made
was having me.

01:20:29.553 --> 01:20:31.188
I've seen the way
she looks at you.

01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:35.525
I've never seen her smile
like that before.

01:20:39.062 --> 01:20:41.164
If there really is a God,

01:20:41.198 --> 01:20:43.066
then you're falling
for her, too.

01:20:44.234 --> 01:20:47.270
Don't you know
your mother is dying?

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:51.709
She doesn't have to.

01:20:55.312 --> 01:20:58.615
You know...

01:21:01.284 --> 01:21:03.688
I've never been able to do
one thing for my mom.

01:21:09.326 --> 01:21:10.695
But now I can.

01:21:16.667 --> 01:21:19.236
Look, it doesn't matter
how much money you got in there.

01:21:19.269 --> 01:21:21.037
You can't change her fate.

01:21:22.105 --> 01:21:23.607
I think I can.

01:21:25.208 --> 01:21:27.812
And you work at El Paso General.

01:21:27.845 --> 01:21:30.815
You can get us the drugs
that we're gonna need.

01:21:30.848 --> 01:21:33.016
Drugs for what?

01:21:36.219 --> 01:21:37.755
I wanna give my mom my liver.

01:21:42.192 --> 01:21:44.662
We're a perfect match.
We're both AB negative, please.

01:21:44.695 --> 01:21:47.632
Ah, you haven't
thought this through.

01:21:49.634 --> 01:21:54.104
Besides,
it's completely illegal.

01:21:59.209 --> 01:22:01.177
People are coming after me.

01:22:01.211 --> 01:22:03.213
What do you mean?
What people?

01:22:06.316 --> 01:22:08.184
That's not important.

01:22:09.452 --> 01:22:13.156
The point is, I've been
everywhere I'm gonna go.

01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:16.493
My chances are all used up.
Man, I'm... I'm done.

01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:24.134
Please.
I'm asking you, please.

01:22:36.747 --> 01:22:40.216
We're sitting here
in a church courtyard...

01:22:43.253 --> 01:22:45.121
and you're asking me
to help take a life.

01:22:47.357 --> 01:22:48.425
No.

01:22:50.427 --> 01:22:52.429
I'm asking you
to help save one.

01:23:04.675 --> 01:23:05.743
What can I get you?

01:23:07.645 --> 01:23:09.680
This kid's name is Billy.

01:23:09.714 --> 01:23:12.449
He thinks he's
a unique individual.

01:23:12.482 --> 01:23:13.550
Have you ever seen him?

01:23:13.583 --> 01:23:14.685
Never seen him.

01:23:14.719 --> 01:23:17.187
You're sure?

01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:20.223
Yeah, I never forget
an asshole in my bar.

01:23:20.256 --> 01:23:23.761
I got $500 in my pocket, cash,

01:23:23.794 --> 01:23:25.696
for anybody here in the bar

01:23:25.730 --> 01:23:29.366
who can tell me where
Billy Walker is at?

01:23:30.467 --> 01:23:31.601
Who got the five?

01:23:34.672 --> 01:23:37.775
No help. No help.

01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:40.176
I don't know him.

01:23:42.212 --> 01:23:43.480
You've got game, ma'am.

01:23:47.818 --> 01:23:50.888
Hey, are you serious
about the money?

01:23:51.922 --> 01:23:56.626
El Paso General.
He's probably there.

01:23:56.661 --> 01:23:58.261
How would you know that?

01:23:58.294 --> 01:24:01.297
His mom.
She's a patient there.

01:24:01.331 --> 01:24:03.266
Actually, she's dying.

01:24:03.299 --> 01:24:06.937
And that dude,
he's a serious mama's boy.

01:24:06.971 --> 01:24:08.438
Grace Andrews?

01:24:08.471 --> 01:24:09.740
Yeah, that's her.

01:24:17.748 --> 01:24:19.784
Did they tell you?

01:24:19.817 --> 01:24:21.317
Hey, guys,
can I get a second?

01:24:21.351 --> 01:24:22.419
No problem.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.624
Yeah. I told you.

01:24:27.658 --> 01:24:29.860
Dr. Perkins is
a miracle worker.

01:24:29.894 --> 01:24:30.895
I'm still in shock.

01:24:34.330 --> 01:24:35.700
You worried about the surgery?

01:24:35.733 --> 01:24:36.767
No.

01:24:39.436 --> 01:24:40.905
I just never thanked you.

01:24:40.938 --> 01:24:42.505
For what?

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:45.643
I spoke with my PO.

01:24:46.242 --> 01:24:48.578
She told me what you did.

01:24:48.611 --> 01:24:50.213
Sarah wasn't
supposed to tell you.

01:24:52.282 --> 01:24:55.285
Yeah. Don't be mad.

01:24:55.318 --> 01:24:57.387
She's a mom, too.

01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:59.890
She actually came by
to check on you.

01:24:59.924 --> 01:25:03.326
Many thanks.
She's an angel.

01:25:03.359 --> 01:25:04.662
You know...

01:25:10.634 --> 01:25:13.503
You got me through everything.

01:25:13.536 --> 01:25:15.673
I'm a mother.
That's my role.

01:25:21.946 --> 01:25:23.948
Sir, we need to get
your mom back to prep.

01:25:23.981 --> 01:25:25.248
Yeah. Listen.

01:25:27.417 --> 01:25:30.721
Don't worry. Okay.
You're gonna be fine.

01:25:30.755 --> 01:25:32.288
I'll see you
the second I get out.

01:25:32.322 --> 01:25:33.758
Okay.

01:25:33.791 --> 01:25:35.659
What is it?

01:25:35.693 --> 01:25:38.062
Nothing.

01:25:38.095 --> 01:25:40.563
Sometimes things do work out
the way you want them to.

01:25:52.408 --> 01:25:53.476
Bye, Mom.

01:26:17.668 --> 01:26:19.536
That money is a great gift.

01:26:22.372 --> 01:26:23.506
You'll send it?

01:26:25.508 --> 01:26:26.576
Thanks, man.

01:26:28.646 --> 01:26:30.014
You're helping
a bunch of people.

01:26:36.787 --> 01:26:39.023
Here's the needle.

01:26:39.056 --> 01:26:40.390
Good luck.

01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:54.604
You sure about this?

01:26:59.844 --> 01:27:00.911
Then, uh...

01:27:03.781 --> 01:27:05.683
Something I better
get off my chest.

01:27:10.553 --> 01:27:15.025
The mother... or the son.

01:27:15.059 --> 01:27:16.060
Now go get it done.

01:27:18.595 --> 01:27:19.797
I wasn't a very good...

01:27:21.999 --> 01:27:26.402
I wasn't any kind of
father at all,

01:27:26.436 --> 01:27:27.972
or a husband,
for that matter.

01:27:30.941 --> 01:27:33.677
You know, um,
the thing is...

01:27:36.113 --> 01:27:38.849
I can't even...

01:27:38.883 --> 01:27:45.521
I can't picture my son as a
baby, or as a little boy.

01:27:45.555 --> 01:27:47.557
I can't. I can't.

01:27:53.163 --> 01:27:54.698
Isn't it terrible?

01:27:57.768 --> 01:28:00.771
I wasn't the kind of man

01:28:00.804 --> 01:28:06.076
the boy should
look up to or learn from,

01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:08.511
but I guess he did.

01:28:14.652 --> 01:28:20.691
I... I guess I taught him...
anger.

01:28:24.627 --> 01:28:25.996
What he got from me was rage.

01:28:29.867 --> 01:28:31.635
I wasn't in the room that
night, but...

01:28:34.504 --> 01:28:36.674
I'm the one who taught him
to double up his fists.

01:28:39.777 --> 01:28:41.679
See, I was less than a man.

01:28:41.712 --> 01:28:43.180
Do have that list ready for me?

01:28:43.213 --> 01:28:44.480
- Yes.
- Awesome. Thank you.

01:28:45.883 --> 01:28:50.955
I was just a sad
and a vicious monster.

01:28:50.988 --> 01:28:52.756
Nurse said she was this way.

01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:54.158
Sir, you can't come in here.

01:28:56.026 --> 01:28:59.629
The woman headed for surgery,
is her name Grace Andrews?

01:29:00.864 --> 01:29:03.200
No. Schofield.

01:29:04.101 --> 01:29:05.135
Excuse me.

01:29:07.137 --> 01:29:08.973
The thing is.

01:29:10.274 --> 01:29:13.978
When...
When Grace looked at me...

01:29:14.011 --> 01:29:16.981
When...
Whenever she looks at me...

01:29:20.918 --> 01:29:24.520
I don't need to get
any closer to God than that.

01:29:28.025 --> 01:29:31.829
I deeply love your mother.

01:29:38.302 --> 01:29:39.502
I know.

01:29:41.939 --> 01:29:42.973
Just take care of her.

01:29:45.575 --> 01:29:46.643
I will.

01:29:58.222 --> 01:29:59.522
Okay.

01:30:02.192 --> 01:30:03.293
Okay.

01:30:06.296 --> 01:30:07.597
Aah.

01:30:11.101 --> 01:30:12.269
I think I'm ready.

01:30:28.886 --> 01:30:29.953
Rest in peace.

01:30:35.959 --> 01:30:36.994
I will.

01:30:49.907 --> 01:30:50.974
Hold it.

01:31:01.151 --> 01:31:06.622
You lucky fuck.
You got off easy.

01:31:06.657 --> 01:31:07.825
What happened?

01:31:12.930 --> 01:31:14.865
DOA.

01:31:14.898 --> 01:31:17.968
A gunshot
and multiple stab wounds.

01:31:21.371 --> 01:31:23.173
Are you family?

01:31:23.207 --> 01:31:26.076
You don't seem too sure
what you just told me.

01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:28.779
What about the mom?

01:31:28.812 --> 01:31:30.814
I just work in the morgue.

01:31:30.848 --> 01:31:33.717
You don't look like somebody
that works at the morgue.

01:31:37.754 --> 01:31:39.223
Well, you don't
look like family.

01:31:43.093 --> 01:31:44.161
Goddammit!

01:31:49.266 --> 01:31:50.934
<i>Pendejo</i> dirt bag.

01:32:44.388 --> 01:32:45.923
You came back?

01:32:45.956 --> 01:32:47.124
We both did.

01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:05.909
Oh. Where's Billy?

01:33:08.178 --> 01:33:09.913
He said he had to go.

01:33:09.947 --> 01:33:12.316
Did he do
something stupid again?

01:33:12.349 --> 01:33:13.951
He didn't say,

01:33:13.984 --> 01:33:19.289
but he did ask me to...
take care of you.

01:33:20.557 --> 01:33:22.459
You're gonna need a nurse.

01:33:23.927 --> 01:33:25.963
What'd you say?

01:33:25.996 --> 01:33:27.464
I said yes.

01:33:36.506 --> 01:33:37.808
You rest now. Huh?

01:33:40.410 --> 01:33:42.179
Plenty of time now
for everything else.

01:33:44.114 --> 01:33:45.148
Okay.

01:34:16.046 --> 01:34:17.914
I thought
you gave that shit up.

01:34:19.082 --> 01:34:20.450
What's good for the goose.

01:34:22.419 --> 01:34:24.187
You found the mother, right?

01:34:24.221 --> 01:34:27.824
Yep. Died of liver failure.

01:34:27.858 --> 01:34:31.528
And the money?
That die, too?

01:34:31.561 --> 01:34:33.463
She had a hundred bucks
in her bank account.

01:34:33.497 --> 01:34:35.132
You want it?

01:34:41.405 --> 01:34:42.606
You remember what I said?

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:45.075
You threatening me?

01:34:45.108 --> 01:34:46.576
I tried to,
but you didn't get it.

01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:47.911
So how about this?

01:34:58.455 --> 01:35:02.292
You know, I really
didn't care about the drugs.

01:35:03.894 --> 01:35:07.632
But the girls,
children, really.

01:35:09.599 --> 01:35:13.337
We found 32 sets of DNA

01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:16.106
inside a six year old
little girl.

01:35:17.207 --> 01:35:18.909
Just one of thousands.

01:35:20.577 --> 01:35:22.279
You had to go and be animals.

01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:29.319
Not me. Fuck you!

01:35:29.353 --> 01:35:32.289
Oink yourself to death,
you pig.

01:35:32.322 --> 01:35:34.057
I'll see you in hell.

01:35:39.996 --> 01:35:41.031
You're welcome, kid.

01:35:45.102 --> 01:35:49.139
<i>This is Det. John Wayne Asher.</i>

01:35:49.172 --> 01:35:53.310
<i>We'll need a bus and a coroner
at the old Reynolds' ranch.</i>

01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:13.664
I got it.

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:18.168
Well...

01:36:18.201 --> 01:36:19.903
Oh.

01:36:27.277 --> 01:36:28.345
Here.

01:36:28.378 --> 01:36:29.946
Okay.

01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:31.481
- Up.
- Okay.

01:36:57.374 --> 01:36:58.508
Where to, ma'am?

01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:01.945
Surprise me.

01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:11.988
Ready?

01:37:18.094 --> 01:37:20.731
<i>There's a real
evil in the world, Mom,</i>

01:37:20.765 --> 01:37:23.166
<i>a pure evil.</i>

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.702
<i>I've seen it.</i>

01:37:24.735 --> 01:37:27.437
<i>It tends to
follow men like me.</i>

01:37:27.471 --> 01:37:30.173
<i>So, I had to go.</i>

01:37:30.207 --> 01:37:33.644
<i>I'm not sure
where I'll end up.</i>

01:37:33.678 --> 01:37:37.782
<i>But please know that I'm leaving
here with a peaceful feeling.</i>

01:37:37.815 --> 01:37:42.252
<i>I believe in good.
I just never drifted that way.</i>

01:37:42.285 --> 01:37:43.955
<i>I believe in you.</i>

01:37:45.055 --> 01:37:47.390
<i>I believe in John,</i>

01:37:47.424 --> 01:37:51.194
<i>and I believe that we'll be
together again someday</i>

01:37:51.228 --> 01:37:53.396
<i>in another time and place.</i>

01:37:54.397 --> 01:37:57.200
<i>Always with you...
Billy.</i>
