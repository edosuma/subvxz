let's not talk
about this tonight,

33:19.830 --> 33:22.734
all right, let's focus
on something happy,

33:23.868 --> 33:25.667
like your birthday.

33:25.669 --> 33:26.839
Which is next week.

33:28.205 --> 33:29.638
I'm excited,

33:29.640 --> 33:30.508
you excited?

33:31.408 --> 33:32.875
I'm excited.

I'm excited to
spend it with you.

33:35.246 --> 33:37.680
But, Mom, that's not
enough to take my mind

33:37.682 --> 33:40.285
off of all the letters I
never received, it's not.

33:46.757 --> 33:48.159
I don't know.

33:50.227 --> 33:51.761
Are you okay?

33:51.763 --> 33:52.728
You know what, I think,

33:52.730 --> 33:54.766
I think I need to go, go rest.

33:56.900 --> 33:58.634
I'm gonna go to bed.

33:58.636 --> 34:00.269
Okay?

34:00.271 --> 34:02.405
But, I will see you bright
and early in the morning.

34:02.407 --> 34:04.342
Okay, well you know
where to find me.

34:05.743 --> 34:06.611
Yes.

34:08.313 --> 34:08.978
I love you.

34:08.980 --> 34:11.447
I love you too, mamma.

34:31.002 --> 34:34.670
Hey, wow, I wasn't
expecting you to pick up.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.771
I was completely prepared
to just leave a message

34:36.773 --> 34:38.442
that you would never respond to.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.947
DAVID: Get quiet, now
to go to your kennel muts.

34:44.382 --> 34:47.516
But, why are you calling, Faith?

34:47.518 --> 34:50.786
It's just, Mom said she
wrote several letters.

34:50.788 --> 34:53.389
DAVID: Enough
dog, settle down!

34:53.391 --> 34:55.458
Let me go take care of
this crazy dog, okay?

34:55.460 --> 34:58.527
Get it quiet down before it
wakes the whole building, sorry.

34:58.529 --> 34:59.398
Of course.

35:00.364 --> 35:01.667
Yeah, I'll call you later.

Bye.

36:09.467 --> 36:11.333
Look what I have.

36:11.335 --> 36:12.737
Yes, this is a bribe.

You're such a good horsie,

36:24.482 --> 36:27.949
and I'm talking to a horse,
that's pretty weird, yeah?

36:27.951 --> 36:28.819
Pretty weird.

36:33.790 --> 36:35.458
Morning, kiddo.

36:35.460 --> 36:36.328
How'd you sleep?

36:37.561 --> 36:38.761
Pretty good.

36:38.763 --> 36:40.429
Where's my mom?

36:40.431 --> 36:41.963
She is still in bed, actually.

36:41.965 --> 36:44.366
Wanted to get a
little extra rest.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.567
She's got a treatment
later today,

36:45.569 --> 36:48.036
and it really kinda
make her nauseated,

36:48.038 --> 36:50.775
so the day after's not so good.

36:51.708 --> 36:52.543
That's rough.

36:53.710 --> 36:54.812
Who usually takes her?

36:56.380 --> 36:57.880
I do, or Corey.

36:57.882 --> 36:58.950
We're a family, right?

37:00.685 --> 37:03.518
Well, I kinda want to start
taking her, if that's cool?

37:03.520 --> 37:04.455
Yeah, it's fine.

37:05.456 --> 37:08.359
In the meantime, you got
a long list to tend to.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.063
Whatever you say, boss.

37:12.529 --> 37:14.929
Can we do this
without being sarcastic?

37:14.931 --> 37:17.433
It came straight from your
mom, I'm just the messenger.

die hard, you know?

37:20.538 --> 37:22.670
Nope, I don't know.

37:22.672 --> 37:24.607
I don't really care.

37:24.609 --> 37:25.907
I just wanna make sure we
get all this stuff done,

37:25.909 --> 37:26.942
so your mom doesn't
have to come home,

37:26.944 --> 37:28.543
and be worried about it.

37:28.545 --> 37:29.781
That's what I want, too.

get started, obviously,

37:57.708 --> 37:59.741
we're gonna need to get
you dressed for the part.

37:59.743 --> 38:01.177
Why are you being so mean?

38:01.179 --> 38:02.844
I mean, I've never
had a reason to have

38:02.846 --> 38:05.880
any other type of shoes, why
would I have farmer boots?

38:05.882 --> 38:08.386
Okay, you're right, I'm sorry.

38:09.487 --> 38:12.020
There is a Western
store in town,

38:12.022 --> 38:13.456
I want you to head down there,

38:13.458 --> 38:14.190

open for the ranch,

38:14.192 --> 38:15.694
you can just charge it to us.

38:17.027 --> 38:19.462
Get dressed, and we will
start this day over again.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.463
Okay, but how
will I get there?

Right, Corey's in the truck.

A tractor, you want me to
take a tractor into town?

the eight miles.

you, works for me.

outsmart you.

already know you.

That all sounds
pretty average to me.

This is all so disgusting.

46:27.951 --> 46:29.953

chicken for dinner?

46:31.255 --> 46:33.558
We do that every night
actually, it's not that bad.

46:34.958 --> 46:36.458
You mean, the chicken
we ate last night

46:36.460 --> 46:39.364
was just playing around
minutes before we ate it?

46:41.464 --> 46:44.299
Faith, we live on a ranch.

46:44.301 --> 46:46.500
We own horses, we eat dinner,

46:46.502 --> 46:48.235
dinner that comes
from a chicken coop,

46:48.237 --> 46:49.603
that's why they're there.

46:49.605 --> 46:50.605
If you ever have scrambled eggs,

46:50.607 --> 46:53.141
they'll also come from
the same chicken coop,

46:53.143 --> 46:54.378
and well bacon, well,

46:55.545 --> 46:57.012
you get it.

the intent to eat them.

Take this,

47:33.750 --> 47:35.717
go stall by stall,

47:35.719 --> 47:38.152

put it in the wheelbarrow,

47:38.154 --> 47:40.322
and just take
everything you can, out.

I have to do this,

47:41.290 --> 47:43.025

My dad had a dog I
had to clean up after,

47:44.228 --> 47:47.295
because he never did, and I had
a hard time stomaching that.

This is on a whole other level.

47:49.132 --> 47:51.233
Next up, you need to
learn how to feed them.

Okay great, so now we're
gonna reload them, thanks Blake.

47:55.339 --> 47:57.007

in brushing them?

Actually, I am.

47:59.810 --> 48:01.375
I've always liked
the idea of horses,

48:01.377 --> 48:02.710
they're beautiful
and intriguing,

48:02.712 --> 48:05.413
but obviously a total mystery

48:05.415 --> 48:07.715
because I've been
completely clueless.

48:07.717 --> 48:09.150
Here.

they don't.

actually have to go in

a chicken today.

help me or not?

you to get used to this,

59:34.002 --> 59:35.104
I'll work on it, okay?

come back with me.

her, not possible.

is all really fresh,

01:01:01.657 --> 01:01:04.491

harder or more uncomfortable.

go over the details

of your mother's will.

read it right now.

01:01:13.869 --> 01:01:15.369
Of course she did.

01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:17.371
She thought it'd be
easier for everybody,

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:19.607
if it were in her own voice.

what I'm about to tell you

is gonna knock
you off your feet.

get more time together.

You have always
been my everything.

Now, I know this is a lot,

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.092
and you probably have
a million thoughts

01:02:46.094 --> 01:02:47.328
running through your head

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:49.663
about how you can

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:51.599
take care of the ranch,

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:54.668
how you get Corey and
Blake to work you for you.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:57.440
But don't you worry,
I have a plan.

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:02.375
I didn't have the
strength to get it done,

01:03:02.377 --> 01:03:03.145
but you can.

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:06.984
Joan, please give
her the letter.

01:03:10.152 --> 01:03:12.221
That letter explains everything.

01:03:13.288 --> 01:03:15.056
All right, don't be afraid.

to think about money.

hearing my mother's voice,

how much she loves me

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.595
and believes in me,

01:03:53.628 --> 01:03:55.128
I cannot run a ranch.

01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:57.297

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:00.601
Just renounce the will.

ownership of the ranch.

the horses, the ranch?

the next of kin.

spinning like a top.

that for yourself,

you something.

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:37.186
Yeah, what is it?

01:22:38.285 --> 01:22:40.487
I wanna take some
time to myself.

01:22:40.489 --> 01:22:42.290
I'm 18 and I wanna
get to know me.

01:22:43.825 --> 01:22:45.625
I'm kind of craving
a new adventure,

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:48.193
as cliche as it sounds.

01:22:48.195 --> 01:22:49.328
I get it.

01:22:49.330 --> 01:22:50.762
I'm a little bummed that
you're not coming back with me,

01:22:50.764 --> 01:22:52.668
but I support you.

01:22:53.869 --> 01:22:54.703
Thanks, Dad.

01:22:55.904 --> 01:22:57.302
It's not like I'm
never coming home,

01:22:57.304 --> 01:22:59.671
I'll be back in a few months.

01:22:59.673 --> 01:23:02.141
Where are you gonna go?

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:05.481
I kind of just wanna
end up everywhere.

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:11.850
I'm really excited to travel,

01:23:11.852 --> 01:23:13.752
and when I get back,
I'm gonna finish school

01:23:13.754 --> 01:23:15.787
and see where life
goes from there.
