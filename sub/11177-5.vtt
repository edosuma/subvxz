00:02.120 --> 00:05.360
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.480 --> 00:07.360
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.400
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:16.280
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:18.920 --> 00:22.120
<i>Michael Bluth
was visiting his father in prison...</i>

00:22.240 --> 00:24.840
<i>anxious to get to the bottom
of some mysterious bookkeeping.</i>

00:24.920 --> 00:26.760
It just doesn't make
any sense, Dad.

00:26.880 --> 00:27.933
Where did this money come from?

00:27.934 --> 00:29.800
Why did it end up in the
international accounts file?

00:29.920 --> 00:33.080
<i>George Sr. was also anxious,
but less about the bookkeeping.</i>

00:33.200 --> 00:36.080
This game is never gonna happen.
Half of these guys are still in their cuffs.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.280
I hate to be a buzzkill,
but I'm trying to get you out of here.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.585
Well, I'm trying to get us
out of last place, Michael.

00:40.586 --> 00:41.880
We're playing Rahway next week.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.760
Word has it that
they're getting Jose Canseco.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.560
I'm starting to wonder
why I even bother coming.

00:47.640 --> 00:49.320
<i>- Bluth! Right field!
- That is ridiculous.</i>

00:49.400 --> 00:52.560
- You won't even talk to me!
- I'm catcher, or I'm nothing!

00:53.960 --> 00:55.880
<i>Michael returned to work...</i>

00:56.000 --> 00:59.080
<i>where his assistant, Kitty,
greeted him with some startling news.</i>

00:59.160 --> 01:00.880
Your wife's on line one.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.760
<i>Michael's wife had been dead for two years.
- My what?</i>

01:03.880 --> 01:06.640
<i>- Kitty realized her mistake.
- I said, your wife is on line one.</i>

01:06.760 --> 01:08.840
<i>But not immediately.</i>

01:08.920 --> 01:10.760
Oh! Oh, God.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.960
I'm sorry.
George's wife. Your mother.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.840
I'm so used to being
George's assistant.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.840
<i>Kitty had been George Sr. 's
fiercely loyal assistant for years.</i>

01:24.600 --> 01:27.880
<i>And Michael suspected that
she had the information he needed.</i>

01:27.960 --> 01:30.880
Hey, Kitty, listen,
you wouldn't know...

01:31.000 --> 01:33.640
if we had any documentation on
these international accounts, would you?

01:33.720 --> 01:36.840
That's actually not
any of your business.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.920
<i>My business.
That's not any of my business.</i>

01:41.800 --> 01:44.040
Hey, Mom.

01:44.120 --> 01:46.920
Are you aware we've been downgraded
to being just pool members at the club now?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.640
Yeah, it's a real shame
what's going on with this family.

01:49.720 --> 01:53.040
You're stuck by the pool,
and Dad's getting picked last for softball.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.480
Nonetheless, you can free up a little
company money to get back our golf privileges.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.760
No, I can't.
Mom, you don't even play golf.

01:58.880 --> 02:02.120
No, but I use the clubhouse dining room...
until I was turned away today.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.520
It's embarrassing... Take it back!

02:04.640 --> 02:08.639
If I wanted something your thumb touched,
I'd eat the inside of your ear!

02:10.199 --> 02:12.520
You should see
the looks I'm getting.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.880
If you can't free up the cash,
have your father call the club president.

02:15.960 --> 02:19.240
I've got news for you, Mom...
I'm not visiting Dad in jail anymore.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.280
No, I've had it.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.910
I'm down there every
single day trying to do

02:22.911 --> 02:24.520
what I can to get this
company back on track...

02:24.640 --> 02:26.840
and he barely even acknowledges me.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.760
That is disgusting!

02:28.880 --> 02:32.640
Talk to your father.
I will not stand for this!

02:35.360 --> 02:36.840
Gob!

02:36.960 --> 02:40.400
Can I, uh... get you
to stop doing that?

02:40.520 --> 02:42.320
I'm just setting up an office.

02:42.440 --> 02:46.480
Gotta write a strongly worded letter
to one Warden James Buck.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.360
<i>In order to restore
his career as an escape artist...</i>

02:49.480 --> 02:52.440
<i>Gob had recently checked into prison
as a publicity stunt.</i>

02:52.520 --> 02:54.728
- You really think you
can break out of my prison?

02:54.729 --> 02:56.200
- You won't even know I was here.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.160
<i>But after a shiv to his side...</i>

02:58.280 --> 03:00.400
<i>Gob was rushed
to a local hospital...</i>

03:00.520 --> 03:04.280
<i>- thus fulfilling, in Gob's mind, his
contract with the public. - ? Ta-dah?</i>

03:04.400 --> 03:08.040
<i>And yet the warden had refused to
acknowledge the legitimacy of the escape.</i>

03:08.120 --> 03:11.920
So I am going after this guy
with everything I've got...

03:12.040 --> 03:13.840
art.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.360
Now we are writing a letter.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.800
<i>Gob?</i>

03:18.920 --> 03:22.600
<i>I wish I would've known
you were coming. I am a mess.</i>

03:22.720 --> 03:24.600
Don't know if a call from me
would've changed that.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.920
Do you like my outfit?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.520
Not as much as I like
what's underneath it.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.440
Gob!

03:31.560 --> 03:34.840
No, I need your chair. Get up.
I've got a letter to write.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.760
Whoo!
You're all business.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.240
just like your dad.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.080
My God, she's repulsive.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.640
<i>Michael realized
that Kitty's obvious attraction to Gob...</i>

03:45.760 --> 03:47.560
<i>could perhaps be of use to him.</i>

03:47.680 --> 03:49.480
How would you like
a touch lamp?

03:49.560 --> 03:51.400
You're the one
who needs therapy!

03:51.480 --> 03:54.600
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay and Tobias prepared
for their first session with a therapist.</i>

03:54.720 --> 03:57.000
Yes, Tobias,
I want the marriage to work.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.400
I just don't know
if therapy is the answer.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.400
Because you didn't respect my old career,
and you certainly don't respect my new one!

04:02.520 --> 04:04.360
<i>You don't have a new one!</i>

04:04.440 --> 04:07.880
<i>Things had been tense
since Tobias left his psychiatry practice...</i>

04:08.000 --> 04:10.120
<i>to pursue an acting career.</i>

04:12.040 --> 04:14.880
- I have needs, you know.
- And how I am not addressing your needs?

04:14.960 --> 04:18.920
- How can you even ask that? What is this?
- Oh! Go right to that!

04:19.000 --> 04:21.920
Good. Go right there.
Real mature. Really great.

04:22.040 --> 04:26.600
Okay, kids, Mommy and Daddy
are going out for ice cream.

04:26.680 --> 04:30.480
- Can we come?
- Sorry. It's not for kids.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.560
<i>- Now we have to follow them.
- Yeah.</i>

04:35.640 --> 04:38.280
What?

04:38.360 --> 04:41.400
Okay, so, why are we doing this?

04:41.520 --> 04:44.240
'Cause it's obvious they're lying.
Come on, drive!

04:44.360 --> 04:47.200
- Well, what if they see us?
- How are they gonna see us?

04:47.320 --> 04:49.480
It says "Bluth Company"
right on the side.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.840
Plus, it's a stairway.
That's gonna catch the eye.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.120
<i>The airport stairway vehicle...</i>

04:55.240 --> 04:58.280
<i>was the last vestige
of the Bluths'former wealth.</i>

04:58.360 --> 05:01.880
<i>Also, that House of Pies
that went out ofbusiness.</i>

05:02.000 --> 05:04.200
You are scared. I knew it.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.560
No, I'm not scared.
It's just that... I have plans later.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.480
I- I'm visiting Pop-Pop.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.520
You visit Pop-Pop?

05:11.640 --> 05:14.560
<i>In fact, he'd been terrified
of the very notion of prison...</i>

05:14.680 --> 05:17.600
<i>since, as a young boy,
he accidentally watched HBO's Oz...</i>

05:17.680 --> 05:20.320
<i>mistaking it for the classic
Judy Garland musical.</i>

05:20.400 --> 05:22.600
<i>- I'm an innocent man!
- Eat it, bitch!</i>

05:22.720 --> 05:25.120
- Lots of times.
- What's it like?

05:25.240 --> 05:28.400
You know what you should do?
You should go get your mom's date book.

05:28.520 --> 05:31.280
Oh, yeah. She must have written down
where they're going.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.440
- I still wanna hear about prison, okay?
- If you can handle it.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.760
<i>Michael arrived home in a good mood.</i>

05:38.880 --> 05:41.160
<i>With Gob getting
the information from Kitty...</i>

05:41.280 --> 05:44.000
<i>he would no longer have to visit prison
and deal with his father.</i>

05:44.080 --> 05:46.520
<i>Hey, buddy!
Came home early.</i>

05:46.640 --> 05:49.000
Wanna do somethin'?
Anything. Anything at all.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.800
I wanna visit Pop-Pop in prison.

05:54.760 --> 05:58.440
<i>Back at the office, Gob was
making progress with Michael's assistant.</i>

05:58.520 --> 06:02.520
Here's where we keep all of our...
heavyweight paper.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.240
Bet you can show me
where a lot of things are.

06:05.360 --> 06:10.440
What kind of things
are you... looking for?

06:10.560 --> 06:13.160
What, uh...
What are you hiding?

06:13.280 --> 06:15.680
Nothing you can't find.

06:15.800 --> 06:19.160
Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait.
Take off your glasses.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.080
Oh.

06:23.160 --> 06:26.320
Wait, wait.
Let down your hair.

06:30.440 --> 06:34.360
No. Glasses on. Hair back up.
Let's just get that hair right back up.

06:34.440 --> 06:37.240
- Do you want me to turn all the lights off?
- Yes, yes, please.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.240
How's that? Is that better?

06:39.320 --> 06:41.760
There's still light coming in
from under the door.

06:41.880 --> 06:44.040
<i>And Lindsay and Tobias
were, for the first time...</i>

06:44.120 --> 06:45.480
<i>addressing
their marital problems.</i>

06:45.560 --> 06:47.720
It's like we're face to face now...

06:47.800 --> 06:51.280
<i>like we're really
seeing this marriage and...</i>

06:51.400 --> 06:53.600
I'm afraid it's a lie.

06:57.520 --> 07:01.800
<i>Bravo. If I gave a performance that good,
I'd have my own Alias type show.</i>

07:01.880 --> 07:06.240
Stop it. I am so sick of hearing
about acting, acting, acting!

07:06.360 --> 07:09.040
Okay, okay, look,
maybe we need a new approach.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.840
Um... let's try
some role playing.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.240
Yes! All right.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.760
<i>Michael headed back to the prison...</i>

07:18.880 --> 07:21.160
<i>despite his earlier vow
never to return.</i>

07:21.280 --> 07:24.160
<i>You always say family first.
I should see my grandpa, right?</i>

07:24.280 --> 07:25.300
I'm not stopping you.

07:25.301 --> 07:27.680
It's just, after this
I'm not going back there.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.640
Why? Is it scary?

07:29.720 --> 07:31.560
Scary? No. No.

07:31.640 --> 07:34.760
It's the opposite of scary.
It's like a carnival.

07:34.840 --> 07:39.280
Without the half-person on the skateboard
that grabbed your knee to steady himself.

07:39.400 --> 07:43.400
<i>It's like a country club. All the guy does
is eat ice cream and play softball all day.</i>

07:43.520 --> 07:48.080
<i>In fact, George Sr. 's
softball game had taken most of the day.</i>

07:48.200 --> 07:50.960
<i>It was the 14th inning,
and tensions were running a little high.</i>

07:51.080 --> 07:54.532
I'll give you a thousand bucks,
you call the next one a strike.

07:54.533 --> 07:55.880
My knees are killing me.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.360
<i>No batter! No batter here!</i>

07:58.480 --> 08:01.960
- Strike three!
- Strike three, my ass!

08:02.040 --> 08:04.080
Ohh!

08:04.200 --> 08:06.560
Down in the yard!

08:06.680 --> 08:09.080
No batter.
No... No batter.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.080
No... Shh.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.520
<i>Okay, there he is.
Go on in there and surprise him.</i>

08:15.600 --> 08:17.920
I'm gonna go get us
a few ice cream sandwiches.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.920
Go on. Go on.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.560
Hey, Pop-Pop.

08:24.680 --> 08:28.200
- How's prison?
- I'm gonna die in here.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.280
What?

08:30.400 --> 08:32.200
They're gonna kill Grandpa.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.080
I gotta... I gotta get outta here.
I'm an innocent man.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.520
You gotta help Pop-Pop get outta here.
Give me your hair.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.400
- My hair?
- Give Pop-Pop your hair!

08:40.520 --> 08:44.240
- No touching! No touching! No touching!
- Give me the hair!

08:44.360 --> 08:48.360
One of these got smooshed,
but don't let that ruin prison for you.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.800
No batter.
No batter. No batter.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.120
<i>Come on, baby!
Throw the ball!</i>

08:59.240 --> 09:02.000
I'm sure your grandfather was just kidding
around. You know his sense of humor.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.920
I know, I know. Yeah.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.360
I don't... I don't totally get
the hair joke, but I'm fine, Dad.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.360
Are you sure?

09:09.480 --> 09:13.520
I am gonna head back in, though. I'm gonna
see if Pop-Pop's got any more zingers.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.400
Just stay out here and relax, pal.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.360
Watch the softball game.
I'll be right back.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.560
<i>Hey, stop! Stop!</i>

09:31.760 --> 09:33.440
Dad?

09:33.520 --> 09:35.360
just don't like prison anymore.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.240
That's why I'm trying
to get you out of here.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.280
Maybe I've been in denial,
but this place is breaking me, Mikey...

09:41.400 --> 09:43.520
and I'm alone here, but for you.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.920
Come on.
You got me, you got Mom.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.400
Your mother's never shown her face.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.320
Whoa.
She's never been here?

09:50.440 --> 09:53.280
You should've heard the grief she gave me
when I said I'd never show up again.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.520
You said... You said what?

09:55.600 --> 09:58.960
Dad, you don't need me.
You're playing softball all the time.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.280
<i>I do need you, Michael!</i>

10:01.360 --> 10:03.200
- No more softball.
- This is nuts.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.080
You're her husband. The least she could do
is come out and visit you.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.291
God, you know your mom.
This isn't her crowd.

10:08.292 --> 10:09.680
She's very easily threatened.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.600
You remember the carjacker?

10:15.560 --> 10:15.899
- Aaah!

10:15.900 --> 10:18.320
- Well, she's certainly
toughened up since then.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.240
She's eating lunch by the pool now.

10:20.360 --> 10:23.080
There's a big difference between the
country club pool and the conjugal trailer.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.320
That's not what I meant
when I said "visit. "

10:25.400 --> 10:27.720
It's too bad.
I really miss that personal contact.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.600
It was the one thing
that calmed me when I got stressed.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.920
It just felt... humanizing.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.840
<i>Michael, for the first time...</i>

10:35.920 --> 10:38.760
<i>saw his father
as a vulnerable human being.</i>

10:39.920 --> 10:42.480
Daddy horny, Michael.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.800
I just haven't had sex in a month.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.040
<i>You've been here two months.</i>

10:50.120 --> 10:52.440
It's hard to gauge time.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.280
Yeah, I'll bet.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.680
Hey, Mom. I went to visit Dad today.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.560
Quick question. How long
does it take you to get out there?

10:59.640 --> 11:01.120
Oh, I've never been.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.440
Then why does he tell me
that you've never been?

11:03.560 --> 11:05.520
Ooh. Sorry, Michael.

11:05.640 --> 11:08.640
Pool food. My system's
not used to curly fries.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.920
How can you ignore that man?

11:12.040 --> 11:14.400
He's having a hard time in there.
He's lonely.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.360
That's what his children are for.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.280
Yeah, well, you know...

11:19.400 --> 11:21.480
there are certain things that...

11:21.560 --> 11:23.760
he can't get from his children.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.695
If you're going to say
"pride," you're wrong.

11:25.696 --> 11:26.840
He is proud of his children.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.040
Wasn't gonna say pride, Mom.

11:29.160 --> 11:32.880
Uh, listen, I-I-I think that, um...

11:33.000 --> 11:35.440
I think that you should...

11:35.560 --> 11:37.840
Oh, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.760
I think that you should...

11:39.880 --> 11:41.680
visit him...

11:41.800 --> 11:44.720
in an... intimate...

11:44.840 --> 11:48.080
marital... trailer.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.280
Are you mad?

11:52.360 --> 11:56.000
You think I'm comfortable asking you
to do this? He needs you, Mom.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.960
Did he say that?

11:59.200 --> 12:01.000
Did he say that he misses me?

12:01.120 --> 12:02.960
Does he need his wife's embrace?

12:03.080 --> 12:04.880
Daddy horny, Michael.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.160
He said some wonderful things.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.240
You really want this for him,
don't you?

12:10.320 --> 12:11.720
I do.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.480
"Golf membership" want it?

12:16.280 --> 12:18.640
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay and Tobias
were getting to the heart...</i>

12:18.760 --> 12:21.200
<i>of each other's vulnerabilities
with a role-reversal exercise.</i>

12:21.320 --> 12:23.040
- Because I'm a woman!
- Good.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.960
- With a woman's needs.
- Louder.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.600
<i>And a woman's urges!
And these, Tobias.</i>

12:27.720 --> 12:30.960
When was the last time
you looked at these?

12:31.080 --> 12:32.880
Yeah, okay.
How long is this session?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.760
See, she's breaking in and out of character
and making it difficult...

12:35.880 --> 12:37.680
'Cause I don't wanna be in a character.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.360
Okay, let me stop you guys.
All right? Please. Let me get in here.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.720
Thank you.
God.

12:45.720 --> 12:49.840
- You've never been a real wife to me, Lindsay.
- That's not true!

12:49.960 --> 12:53.560
A man is looking back at you.
A man with dreams and aspirations!

12:53.640 --> 12:56.960
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby found an
address in her mother's appointment book...</i>

12:57.080 --> 13:00.560
<i>and was getting closer to learning
what her parents were up to.</i>

13:00.680 --> 13:06.080
Right! If I'm no Schwimmer,
you're noJennifer Aniston!

13:06.160 --> 13:09.560
<i>Maybe I'm not even Lisa Kudrow.</i>

13:09.680 --> 13:11.920
I- I have dreams, Lindsay.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.400
Dreams, Lindsay.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.480
Well, then, Tobias...

13:21.600 --> 13:23.440
follow those dreams.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.360
Make those dreams happen.

13:25.480 --> 13:28.080
Yes. I will.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.680
And scene!

13:32.360 --> 13:34.400
- Wow!
- Okay.

13:34.520 --> 13:37.680
- I'm sorry I stepped on your line.
- No, not at all.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.040
- Did that answer some questions for you?
- Yeah, I think it did.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.440
Now there are two men
I wanna leave.

13:45.320 --> 13:48.560
<i>Michael arrived home, happy
to have a brother to share his burden with.</i>

13:48.680 --> 13:51.720
<i>- Great news.
- Oh, good. I could use it.</i>

13:51.800 --> 13:54.360
I just came from convincing Mom
to have sex with Dad.

13:54.440 --> 13:57.840
God! What is wrong with you?
That is disgusting!

13:57.960 --> 14:00.000
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

14:00.080 --> 14:03.560
But just the thought
of Mom and Dad together...

14:03.680 --> 14:05.760
I have a sense of propriety.
All right?

14:05.840 --> 14:07.680
Fine.
What's your great news?

14:07.760 --> 14:09.280
I Kitty.

14:09.360 --> 14:12.480
Oh, Gob, I just wanted you
to get the information.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.320
Oh, I got the information.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.360
You did, huh?
About the international accounts?

14:20.120 --> 14:22.920
I see what you're getting at.
No, I didn't get any information.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
That's great. Good, good, good, Gob.
You just lost the touch lamp.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.920
- What? No!
- The deal's off.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.608
I'm gonna use the touch
lamp to set the mood

14:29.609 --> 14:31.280
in the conjugal trailer
when Dad's nailing Mom!

14:31.400 --> 14:33.120
No! Don't... Michael!

14:33.200 --> 14:34.960
<i>You are filthy!</i>

14:37.040 --> 14:38.760
<i>The two cousins reunited...</i>

14:38.880 --> 14:42.000
<i>each a little shaken by what they
had pretended to be fearless about.</i>

14:42.120 --> 14:44.280
<i>- You think they'll get divorced?
- I don't care.</i>

14:44.360 --> 14:47.640
I'm not saying "I don't care" like kids who say
they don't when they do... 'cause I don't.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.640
Right. I know.
Who cares, right?

14:51.240 --> 14:53.480
<i>- I mean, I care.
- How could you not?</i>

14:53.600 --> 14:55.560
You know, our family's
really messed up.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.720
I know.
We're the only normal ones.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.520
At least we got
each other. Right?

15:08.800 --> 15:10.720
George Michael?

15:10.800 --> 15:12.640
Sorry.

15:12.720 --> 15:16.480
Sometimes I don't know if it's gonna be
a long or short hug or a middle-medium hug.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.400
It's hard to tell sometimes.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.680
That was a good hug.
That's plenty for now.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.600
Hug's gotta end sometime, obviously.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.760
<i>Soon, Michael
was driving Lucille to prison...</i>

15:25.840 --> 15:28.440
<i>and she seemed to be
looking forward to it.</i>

15:28.520 --> 15:30.440
Where are we going after?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.440
<i>- Hey, Dad.
- Michael!</i>

15:36.520 --> 15:38.720
What are you doing here?

15:38.800 --> 15:40.743
You needed my help, and
it was hard for you to ask,

15:40.744 --> 15:42.200
so I took it upon myself to bring her.

15:42.280 --> 15:45.600
<i>- That doesn't make you uncomfortable?
- The drive was a little awkward.</i>

15:45.680 --> 15:49.120
Not every son
would do this for his father.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.080
Thank you for this.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.520
<i>Hello, George.</i>

15:57.640 --> 15:59.640
What the hell's
your mother doing in here?

15:59.720 --> 16:02.440
- Who were you expecting?
- Oh, I've done a bad thing.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.160
I've done a terrible thing.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.040
- There's someone else in that trailer, isn't there?
- I've done a repulsive thing.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.440
Wait... Whoa. It's Kitty?

16:09.800 --> 16:11.360
- Shh!
- How long?

16:11.480 --> 16:13.800
- When did this start?
- Oh, come on! This is the first time.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.720
Every Friday for the last eight years.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.560
- Daddy...
- Horny. I got that.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.440
Hey, wait a minute.
This is easy. This is an easy one.

16:24.520 --> 16:27.040
I'll go in there with Kitty,
I'll do my thing...

16:27.120 --> 16:30.680
and th-th-then I'll go and see your moth...
This is a hard one.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.680
- She's your secretary.
- You're right.

16:32.760 --> 16:34.720
Family first.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.960
Take care of Kitty.
Michael.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.920
I need you now.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.280
"International accounts" need me?

16:42.360 --> 16:44.200
<i>And so an agreement was made.</i>

16:44.280 --> 16:45.920
<i>George Sr.
would reveal the truth...</i>

16:46.000 --> 16:49.240
<i>and Michael would make sure
Kitty didn't come out of the trailer.</i>

16:49.320 --> 16:51.480
Yeah?

16:51.560 --> 16:53.600
I need you to come to the prison.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.040
- I'm at the prison.
- You're here?

16:56.120 --> 16:59.720
I'm delivering
this strongly worded letter I wrote...

16:59.800 --> 17:01.880
lit by nothing but natural light.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.960
<i>Well, how would you like
that touch lamp and the office...</i>

17:05.040 --> 17:09.400
<i>and... what the hell...
full use of the secretary?</i>

17:11.079 --> 17:15.040
Thank you for doing this.
It means a... It means a lot.

17:15.119 --> 17:18.240
I, uh... Okay,
I'll get down on the couch.

17:18.319 --> 17:21.560
I'm not going to have sex
with you, George.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.839
I came to tell you how much I hate you
for what you've done to this family.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.160
- You're angry.
- You've ruined us.

17:27.240 --> 17:31.000
<i>I've ruined us?
You got a lot of nerve, honey.</i>

17:31.080 --> 17:34.400
The millions you pissed away on clothing
and jewelry and spa treatments...

17:34.520 --> 17:37.960
Yes, to keep you interested in the only
thing you ever appreciated... my body.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.120
Can I help it
if you've got a fantastic body?

17:40.200 --> 17:43.880
And you're as powerful as a bear.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.960
My husband the bear.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.280
This bear needs
some honey, wife.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.400
Oh, God, I missed you!

17:53.480 --> 17:56.600
<i>Gob, meanwhile, stalled
to keep Kitty in the other trailer.</i>

17:56.680 --> 17:58.040
Glasses off.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.400
Glasses on.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.240
Hair up.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.160
Glasses off.

18:03.240 --> 18:06.120
Down, on.
Have we done up, off?

18:06.240 --> 18:08.360
<i>- Oh, Gob, this is so wrong.
- And bright.</i>

18:08.440 --> 18:11.240
Wrong a-and bright.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.240
This...

18:13.320 --> 18:15.640
That's be... brighter!

18:15.720 --> 18:17.560
God! Damn.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.800
I'm just gonna wash up
real quick.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.880
Uh, I think I'm gonna go with...
with down and off.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.840
<i>Gob had to do the right thing.</i>

18:28.880 --> 18:31.800
<i>But as he headed to his car,
he ran into the warden...</i>

18:31.880 --> 18:33.920
<i>who hadjust read
his strongly worded letter.</i>

18:34.000 --> 18:37.320
Well, if it isn't
"Sincerely Yours. "

18:38.960 --> 18:41.960
<i>And so Gob was detained against
the window of the trailer...</i>

18:42.080 --> 18:43.880
<i>his parents were becoming intimate in.</i>

18:43.960 --> 18:46.680
Oh, God, Mommy! What did you do?

18:51.320 --> 18:54.240
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, where were you?

18:54.360 --> 18:56.800
I had to help out your grandfather...

18:56.880 --> 18:59.680
and then I had to vow that I would
never help your grandfather again.

18:59.760 --> 19:01.600
Pretty much a normal day for me.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.560
How are you doing?

19:03.640 --> 19:06.040
I'm fine, I guess. It's just...

19:06.120 --> 19:08.962
You think of prison as this
place full of guilty people

19:08.963 --> 19:10.840
and it doesn't bother you that much.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.720
But if Pop-Pop could be there,
then anybody could be there.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.680
And I don't wanna go to prison, Dad.
I don't think I could take it.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.600
I know I act tough, but I...

19:18.720 --> 19:20.320
Is this what you're worried about?

19:22.040 --> 19:23.880
'Cause I got news...

19:23.960 --> 19:26.120
he's, uh... he's guilty.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.320
He is?

19:28.400 --> 19:29.800
Oh, yeah.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.800
Incredibly guilty.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.560
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

19:41.640 --> 19:44.280
<i>Tobias talks Lindsay
into another session.</i>

19:44.360 --> 19:46.920
I've decided that...

19:47.040 --> 19:50.680
I want to become an actor too.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.440

have committed some,
um...

20:05.000 --> 20:09.400
light...
treason.
