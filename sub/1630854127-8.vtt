WEBVTT

00:11.803 --> 00:13.513
<i>No.</i>

00:43.376 --> 00:45.545
Uh, could I see him?

01:19.788 --> 01:22.207
Guess I really done it this time, huh?

01:22.290 --> 01:23.333
Mm.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.213
-Sorry, Dad.
-No, it's okay.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.965
It's okay. It's okay. Come on.

01:33.551 --> 01:34.427
Take a seat.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.598
Because we got, uh…

01:39.974 --> 01:41.893
I gotta… I gotta… We…

01:44.020 --> 01:44.896
We…

01:50.360 --> 01:51.778
I don't know where to begin.

02:00.328 --> 02:01.704
How's Grandma?

02:03.206 --> 02:04.249
Oh, she's good.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.127
She sends her love.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.462
'Kay.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.717
Did you ever get around to fixing that AC?

02:19.389 --> 02:20.849
I don't know what to say.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.436
'Kay.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.021
Well…

02:29.816 --> 02:30.775
neither do I.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.528
I didn't realize how sick you were.

02:37.824 --> 02:38.992
You need help.

02:40.869 --> 02:41.828
'Kay.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.204
No, I mean…

02:44.706 --> 02:46.791
You know, like from a professional.

02:48.376 --> 02:49.335
Because

02:50.753 --> 02:52.589
I still think you can be treated.

02:55.049 --> 02:57.760
You know what? 'Cause I…

02:59.137 --> 03:01.598
You know,
I have to hope you can get better.

03:04.809 --> 03:05.643
Oh.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.770
'Cause I just…

03:12.150 --> 03:15.111
I've just been trying
to think how this all happened.

03:16.112 --> 03:18.531
'Cause I didn't raise you to be like this.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.618
Yeah.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.620
So why do you think you…

03:27.415 --> 03:28.541
Why'd you do it?

03:32.170 --> 03:33.296
I don't know.

03:33.922 --> 03:38.635
Okay. Well, see,
now, that's not gonna cut it.

03:40.553 --> 03:43.056
-Well, sorry.
-Well, Jeff…

03:45.183 --> 03:46.809
I don't need you to say sorry.

03:50.521 --> 03:51.898
I need to know why.

03:53.024 --> 03:56.152
Because there needs
to be some responsibility here.

03:56.236 --> 04:00.865
What you've done to the family,
to Grandma, to Shari and me.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.117
Mm.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.578
I mean, do you--?

04:08.915 --> 04:11.209
Do you have any idea how this all started?

04:13.503 --> 04:14.671
I don't know.

04:17.048 --> 04:20.593
I mean, I been… thinking about it.

04:21.803 --> 04:22.762
A lot.

04:24.555 --> 04:25.723
You know?

04:29.310 --> 04:30.561
So I used to…

04:34.816 --> 04:35.817
Well…

04:37.610 --> 04:41.197
Remember when you used to take me
to go and find roadkill

04:41.281 --> 04:43.324
and we'd cut 'em up?

04:43.408 --> 04:44.701
No, no, no, .

04:46.244 --> 04:48.496
You're not gonna lay this on me, no.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.957
No.

04:51.040 --> 04:51.916
'Kay.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.376
It's not my fault.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.627
I didn't do this.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.672
-I was a good dad to you.
-I know.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.882
I mean, I…

05:00.508 --> 05:01.551
What?

05:01.634 --> 05:03.219
Ah…

05:03.303 --> 05:05.138
Uh…

05:05.221 --> 05:08.141
All I… What I was doing was
I was showing concern for my son

05:08.224 --> 05:09.684
who showed an interest in something.

05:09.767 --> 05:10.768
It's okay, Dad.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.688
You know, what you did,
I didn't teach you how to do that.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.106
-Don't.
-You hear me?

05:15.189 --> 05:16.149
'Kay.

05:20.194 --> 05:21.612
I didn't do this!

05:33.166 --> 05:34.375
That's Joyce Dahmer!

05:35.335 --> 05:36.919
-Let's move.
-There she is!

05:37.003 --> 05:38.504
-Mrs. Dahmer!

05:38.588 --> 05:40.506
Can we talk to you about your son Jeffrey?

05:40.590 --> 05:42.925
How do you feel about
the crimes he's been accused of?

05:43.009 --> 05:45.261
-Leave me alone.
-Know why your son ate people?

05:45.345 --> 05:47.263
Why's he seem to target
Black and Latino gay men?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.390
-Think these were hate crimes?
-I said leave me alone!

05:49.474 --> 05:51.392
-Do you feel responsible?
-One more question.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.853
Ah! My name is not Dahmer!

05:58.107 --> 05:59.192
Thank you.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.291
Isaac Richards?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.667
Yes.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.963
I'm Joyce Flint.

06:25.093 --> 06:29.514
I have the results of your HIV test.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.146
You're negative.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.116
Jesus.

07:15.393 --> 07:19.522
Ma'am, why are <i>you </i>crying?

07:20.648 --> 07:21.983
It's just my…

07:28.531 --> 07:32.285
I'm just so happy you don't have
to give your mother any bad news.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.463
Sweetheart?

07:45.673 --> 07:47.300
Lionel, what are you doing?

07:47.383 --> 07:49.760
Oh, I'm just, uh… I'm up early.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.263
You never came to bed.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.141
I'm sorry, what did you say?

07:56.476 --> 07:57.560
Honey…

07:58.978 --> 08:00.229
we need to talk.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.196
Honey, you have to sleep.
This isn't healthy.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.781
Well, my schedule's all messed up.

08:10.865 --> 08:14.702
Well, you should
be using this time just to rest.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.497
I can't rest, Shari.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.541
Then we need to see a doctor
and get you some sleeping pills.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.667
Jesus Christ…

08:21.751 --> 08:24.504
Because five nights in a row
of not sleeping is not healthy.

08:24.587 --> 08:28.174
Yeah, that'll do it. Yeah, more pills.
That's just what this family needs.

08:28.257 --> 08:31.511
You do know that pills are what started
this whole thing. You know that.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.512
Just calm down.

08:32.595 --> 08:36.098
How many pills you think she was on
when she was pregnant with him? Thousands.

08:36.182 --> 08:39.477
She was, sleeping pills,
sedatives, seizure medication.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.020
She didn't give him a fucking chance.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.023
Come on, you can't blame Joyce for this.

08:44.106 --> 08:45.775
The fuck I can't!

08:47.193 --> 08:49.028
Because it's her fault!

08:51.113 --> 08:52.698
She wasn't a mother!

08:54.742 --> 08:56.452
She never even held him!

08:56.536 --> 08:59.580
-Stop screaming!
-She scared the shit out of him!

09:00.957 --> 09:02.416
And then she just left!

09:03.084 --> 09:05.169
She got in her car, and she drove away,

09:05.253 --> 09:08.381
and she left that kid
in that house all summer.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.841
Well, where were <i>you </i>that summer, Lionel?

09:12.843 --> 09:15.846
Oh, God-- No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

09:16.472 --> 09:19.517
Oh, hey, we are in this together.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.271
I should have checked up on him.
I didn't check up on him.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.314
-But you didn't know!

09:29.610 --> 09:31.237
He's got my genes, Shari.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.531
Half of that boy is me.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.408
And I…

09:37.577 --> 09:39.787
I've had thoughts like him, I think.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.706
I used to.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.209
I used to

09:46.085 --> 09:47.712
try to make explosives.

09:49.005 --> 09:53.884
And I would use fireworks,
and I would tie a little army guy to them.

09:53.968 --> 09:57.888
And one day, I brought
a homemade bomb to school.

10:00.516 --> 10:03.936
And I threw it out
the goddamn window for Christ's sake.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.855
Oh, honey, that's not the same thing.

10:05.938 --> 10:09.191
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, listen.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.824
I had fantasies like him too, I think.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.662
There was a neighborhood girl,
and she lived on our block.

10:21.746 --> 10:25.958
And I tried to hypnotize her because…

10:28.252 --> 10:29.253
I don't know.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.508
To get her to do whatever I wanted.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.556
And I used to sit in church…

10:46.228 --> 10:49.231
and think of what it would be like
to kill someone, to murder them.

10:51.901 --> 10:56.322
And, uh, I had nightmares about it
for a while, I did.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.451
But it wasn't about how I'd

11:01.577 --> 11:06.415
kill someone because it was about
how I'd already done it.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.504
Knowing that I'd killed someone
and not knowing what to do.

11:13.547 --> 11:14.924
But you didn't.

11:15.758 --> 11:19.720
There is nothing wrong
with your genes, honey.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.430
I mean, just look at David.

11:21.972 --> 11:25.601
He's got half your DNA,
and he's a nice, normal kid.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.852
Wouldn't you say?

11:28.688 --> 11:29.772
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.776
-Aw…

11:34.485 --> 11:35.695
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.674
Oh my…

12:03.681 --> 12:06.642
Sir, you're not allowed to be here.
You can't go in there, sir!

12:11.188 --> 12:15.735
Jeff! He's probably
asleep upstairs. It's so early!

12:15.818 --> 12:17.528
-Leave her alone.
-You cannot be here.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.155
-She's my mother.
-Get him out of here.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.074
-You're scaring her. You have no right.
-This is a crime scene, sir.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.410
Your son killed people
in this house, Mr. Dahmer.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.703
-Understand that?
-You have no--

12:25.786 --> 12:27.830
He's cooperating with us. You know that?

12:27.913 --> 12:30.791
She has dementia. You come here,
she can have a breakdown.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.294
Jeff! You come down here.

12:33.377 --> 12:36.839
-Sir?
-Please, just let me put her in her room.

12:36.922 --> 12:40.384
We'll be out of your way.
Please. Please. Come on, Ma.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.306
There's that queen.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.477
Lionel?

12:51.353 --> 12:53.147
-Oh, yeah.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.275
Um, okay.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.068
Oh.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.448
Oh.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.077
Uh… it's your move, Ma.

13:10.289 --> 13:14.585
<i>Today,</i>
<i>the city of Milwaukee is hurting.</i>

13:16.879 --> 13:22.343
<i>Jeffrey Dahmer's heinous crimes</i>
<i>have not only shocked the nation.</i>

13:22.426 --> 13:28.182
<i>They've inflicted a painful</i>
<i>and devastating wound on this community.</i>

13:30.226 --> 13:32.686
<i>Now, some folks have asked me,</i>

13:32.770 --> 13:37.066
"Reverend, why are you
going out to Milwaukee?"

13:37.775 --> 13:39.151
"Dahmer's been caught."

13:39.235 --> 13:42.238
"Aren't you just
stirring up more division?"

13:44.740 --> 13:46.575
To those folks, I say,

13:47.535 --> 13:50.496
"I come here today not to sow division,

13:50.579 --> 13:53.666
but the call for accountability."

13:55.501 --> 13:58.254
Dahmer's crimes
weren't committed in a vacuum.

13:59.588 --> 14:03.050
Many people,
including officers of the law,

14:03.133 --> 14:04.844
turned a blind eye,

14:04.927 --> 14:09.348
which is why he was able
to do what he did for so long.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.936
But you're lucky
you've got a strong leader

14:14.019 --> 14:16.105
in Police Chief Arreola.

14:16.730 --> 14:20.860
The chief told me he's planning
to launch a thorough investigation

14:20.943 --> 14:22.528
into what went wrong,

14:22.611 --> 14:26.532
especially that incident
involving that young boy,

14:26.615 --> 14:28.868
Konerak Sinthasomphone.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.745
But let me be clear.

14:32.621 --> 14:38.043
We are not content
to simply listen to words,

14:38.127 --> 14:39.211
comforting words.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.796
-Okay!
-Yes!

14:40.880 --> 14:42.882
Words like "healing,"

14:44.550 --> 14:45.801
"cooling down,"

14:47.052 --> 14:48.888
"coming together."

14:50.014 --> 14:55.394
Those are all code words
that mean exactly the same thing.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.606
"Let's sweep this under the rug."

15:00.858 --> 15:02.735
We will not be satisfied.

15:02.818 --> 15:07.907
We will not rest
until the conditions no longer exist

15:07.990 --> 15:10.826
that would allow someone
like Jeffrey Dahmer

15:10.910 --> 15:15.039
to murder 17 young men,
many of them Black and brown.

15:15.122 --> 15:20.836
We will not rest until justice prevails
for all citizens in this city.

15:20.920 --> 15:25.633
We will not rest until empty words
are replaced with decisive action!

15:25.716 --> 15:29.762
-We will not rest! We will not rest!

15:37.436 --> 15:39.855
This isn't fair, Chief.
You can't suspend us.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.065
We did nothing wrong.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.274
Nothing wrong?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.818
You returned an underage boy
back to a serial killer

15:44.902 --> 15:46.570
that would eventually kill him.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.281
You didn't check
his identification or his age.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.532
You ignored witnesses.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.326
You didn't do
a background check on Dahmer.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.495
We didn't see a need
to do a background check.

15:54.578 --> 15:58.082
If you had, you'd have seen that Dahmer
was on probation for child molestation.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.417
Look, the kid
looked like an adult, all right?

16:00.501 --> 16:02.544
We thought it was
a boyfriend-boyfriend thing.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.631
So I guess that's why you had
to get "deloused" after the incident.

16:05.714 --> 16:08.008
That <i>is </i>what you told dispatch.
We have it on tape.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.051
That was a joke.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.971
Then there's Glenda Cleveland,
Dahmer's neighbor.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.390
She claims that she called
multiple times about him,

16:14.473 --> 16:15.766
but you ignored her request.

16:15.849 --> 16:16.934
Whose side are you on?

16:17.017 --> 16:19.186
This isn't about sides.
You boys screwed up.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.688
And I'm under a lot of pressure.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.148
I have the mayor,
the community, Jesse Jackson,

16:23.232 --> 16:25.442
the whole damn country's
breathing down my neck.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.695
-I have to do something.
-You're our police chief.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.321
You're supposed to have our backs.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.868
You'll both be on paid leave until
the panel finishes its investigation,

16:34.952 --> 16:37.162
after which we'll make
a final determination.

16:41.792 --> 16:45.170
You know what?
Our union reps are gonna fight this.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.257
You can't fire us. Trust me.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.136
We will be here long after you.

16:57.307 --> 17:00.144
<i> Did you think</i>
<i>Jeffrey Dahmer was going to eat you?</i>

17:00.936 --> 17:01.812
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:03.856 --> 17:04.815
<i>I did.</i>

17:07.443 --> 17:09.236
<i>He said he was going to eat my heart.</i>

17:10.696 --> 17:12.031
<i>Harrowing stuff.</i>

17:12.906 --> 17:14.783
<i>His name is Tracy Edwards,</i>

17:14.867 --> 17:17.786
<i>the man who was almost</i>
<i>Jeffrey Dahmer's final victim.</i>

17:18.579 --> 17:21.081
<i>Thank you, Tracy, for telling your story.</i>

17:21.165 --> 17:23.792
<i>Our next guest is a childhood friend</i>
<i>of Jeffrey Dahmer's</i>

17:23.876 --> 17:27.671
<i>who agreed to come on the show</i>
<i>on condition of anonymity,</i>

17:27.755 --> 17:30.841
<i>and he's got a story</i>
<i>that's a </i>Geraldo<i> exclusive.</i>

17:30.924 --> 17:32.342
<i>We'll call him Nick.</i>

17:33.010 --> 17:34.803
<i>Thank you for coming on the show.</i>

17:35.387 --> 17:37.014
<i>Thank you for having me.</i>

17:37.514 --> 17:42.436
<i>I understand you had</i>
<i>a sexual relationship with Jeffrey Dahmer.</i>

17:42.519 --> 17:44.063
<i>How did you meet him?</i>

17:44.730 --> 17:46.523
<i>We were on the yearbook staff together.</i>

17:46.607 --> 17:48.108
-Jeff wasn't yearbook staff.

17:48.192 --> 17:51.904
<i>And where did</i>
<i>this sexual activity take place?</i>

17:52.905 --> 17:53.989
<i> At his house.</i>

17:55.157 --> 17:56.658
<i>Did you meet his family?</i>

17:56.742 --> 18:00.162
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>he had a stepmother who was like…</i>

18:00.704 --> 18:04.333
<i>She was like the stepmother from hell,</i>
<i>screaming at him all the time…</i>

18:05.084 --> 18:06.293
It's just… It's just all lies.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.504
<i>That's Lionel Dahmer's second wife, Shari.</i>

18:09.088 --> 18:12.049
<i>And, um, he said to me,</i>

18:13.217 --> 18:14.927
<i>he told me that he was</i>

18:16.261 --> 18:18.722
<i>sexually molested by his father.</i>

18:20.057 --> 18:21.350
I'm not watching this.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.770
-<i>Nick, Jeffrey Dahmer told--</i>

18:24.853 --> 18:26.271
That's not true, Lionel.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.108
No, it's not true! None of it's true!

18:29.191 --> 18:30.776
Well, sweetheart, what can you do?

18:30.859 --> 18:33.195
I don't know. I… I don't know.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.114
I gotta do something.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.076
What?

18:44.790 --> 18:47.417
You're on the cover
of <i>Newsweek </i>and <i>People </i>magazine.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.216
Wow.

18:56.510 --> 18:57.469
Okay.

19:00.139 --> 19:04.184
You think I could take these with me?
Just to read?

19:04.268 --> 19:05.602
No, you can't.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.066
Mm.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.194
What do they say?

19:14.278 --> 19:16.738
Well, what do they say?
It's not good, Jeff.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.950
They're saying
you're the Milwaukee Cannibal.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.828
People want to kill you.
They want you dead.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.957
Well fine. I want that too.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.750
No, no, no, no, you don't.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.128
Wisconsin doesn't have the death penalty.

19:32.337 --> 19:36.008
Well, they're talking about bringing
it back, though, because of me, right?

19:36.091 --> 19:39.386
No, no, Jeff,
just get that out of your head. No.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.681
Look,

19:43.348 --> 19:45.642
it doesn't help anybody

19:45.726 --> 19:48.270
for you to spend the rest
of your life in prison.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.147
Okay? You need help.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.900
And there's really
only one way we can do that.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.276
That's right, yeah. Uh…

19:54.985 --> 19:57.779
For you to get the help you need,
so we can understand this,

19:57.863 --> 20:00.616
we have to convince the judge
that you're insane, Jeff.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.494
But I'm not insane.

20:05.078 --> 20:07.331
Well, at the time of the killings then.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.544
-Hmm. No, I wasn't then, either.
-Oh, jee-- Come on, Jeff.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.923
I mean, you killed people, you cut 'em up.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.216
You had sex with them.

20:18.175 --> 20:21.136
You had to stop dismembering them
so you could masturbate on them.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.723
But I wasn't crazy.
It was just like a… a compulsion.

20:24.806 --> 20:27.226
Right, okay, so you had a compulsion,

20:27.309 --> 20:29.394
which means you couldn't stop.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.146
Yeah, Jeff. Come on.

20:32.022 --> 20:35.609
Come on, you talked about demon--
You said that you were possessed.

20:35.692 --> 20:40.239
And you said that you'd wake up
and you didn't remember what you did.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.366
'Cause I was blackout drunk, Dad.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.952
That's why I didn't remember some stuff.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.038
But I knew what I was doing.

20:49.289 --> 20:50.832
Didn't want to, but…

20:52.960 --> 20:54.378
couldn't help myself.

20:56.672 --> 20:57.923
I'm not insane.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.384
No. Jeff, no. No.

21:02.469 --> 21:05.514
You're not gonna say that in court.
You just-- You're not.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.599
Because, uh…

21:09.017 --> 21:10.811
we got something now, okay?

21:10.894 --> 21:12.646
We got a legal precedent.

21:13.563 --> 21:17.567
Uh, there's a previous case that's--
He's very similar to yours.

21:17.651 --> 21:18.860
And it wasn't far from here.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.739
Uh, what…
what this guy did, it's just very similar.

21:23.240 --> 21:26.410
It was a while ago,
back when I was a kid.

21:26.493 --> 21:27.869
This was in Plainfield.

21:28.662 --> 21:32.416
-November 16, 1957.
-Fifty-seven. Mm-hmm.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.753
The owner of a hardware store,
she disappears.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.964
Now, no one knows where she is.

21:39.923 --> 21:44.636
Her son tells the police
that a man by the name of Ed Gein

21:45.262 --> 21:47.889
had been there the evening before.

21:49.349 --> 21:50.892
<i> So they go to his house.</i>

21:53.395 --> 21:54.521
<i>Nobody's there.</i>

21:56.315 --> 21:59.609
So they walk around the back
and find a shed.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.200
Oh my…

22:07.284 --> 22:09.244
Jesus Christ.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.289
<i>And there's the woman's body.</i>

22:12.956 --> 22:15.125
All cut up, hanging from the rafters.

22:15.834 --> 22:16.918
So they arrest him.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.172
He doesn't say a thing.

22:22.090 --> 22:25.344
<i>For 30 hours straight,</i>
<i>he just sits there.</i>

22:27.637 --> 22:29.056
<i>Finally, he pipes up.</i>

22:30.557 --> 22:32.267
I'd like an apple pie

22:33.226 --> 22:34.770
and a slice of cheese.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.188
<i>Then he starts talking.</i>

22:37.564 --> 22:39.066
They search the house.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.153
<i>They find the woman's head</i>
<i>in a burlap sack,</i>

22:43.236 --> 22:46.448
<i>and there's just body parts everywhere.</i>

22:48.992 --> 22:51.161
<i>Bowls made out of people's skulls.</i>

22:52.329 --> 22:54.539
<i>He had skulls on his bedposts.</i>

22:55.749 --> 22:57.918
He upholstered his chairs

22:58.001 --> 22:59.461
with human skin.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.214
And, uh, just like you,

23:02.297 --> 23:04.800
Jeff, you know, you said you, um…

23:05.926 --> 23:07.594
tried to dig up a body once.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.304
Yeah, just once.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.972
Yeah, well, turns out this guy,

23:11.681 --> 23:15.143
he did it like 30, 40 times,
digging up bodies.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.520
Oh, wow.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.730
They looked in the coffins.
They were empty.

23:19.272 --> 23:23.693
And… And he went into a kind of a daze
when he did these things,

23:23.777 --> 23:25.570
and then he would kinda wake up and…

23:25.654 --> 23:28.698
and he couldn't remember what happened.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.618
Did he have sex with the bodies he dug up?

23:31.701 --> 23:35.122
Okay. Okay. Jeff, here, Ed Gein… Okay…

23:36.164 --> 23:39.543
The point is
he killed a lot of people too, okay?

23:39.626 --> 23:41.002
And there's no denying that.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.005
But, um, he entered a plea of not guilty

23:44.089 --> 23:47.300
by reason of insanity, and didn't
spend the rest of his life in prison.

23:47.384 --> 23:50.554
He spent the rest of his life
in a hospital,

23:50.637 --> 23:52.806
getting the psychiatric help
that he needed.

23:53.348 --> 23:54.266
You see?

23:54.349 --> 23:56.643
We can do the same thing for you, Jeff.

23:58.478 --> 23:59.563
Hmm.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.735
Well, that… That does sound familiar.

24:06.611 --> 24:07.612
What?

24:08.405 --> 24:09.281
Uh…

24:10.073 --> 24:11.658
I've read about him.

24:14.077 --> 24:17.789
You know, it was a comic book
I read about him, I think.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.917
I'm sorry. Did you say a comic book?

24:22.085 --> 24:26.756
Yeah, it was one of those, uh,
<i>Weird Tales</i> ones or something.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.966
Spooky stuff.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.388
I remember the cover, I think.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.475
A fucking comic book.

24:36.558 --> 24:39.603
I mean… Well, now we know
where the fault lies, the whole culture.

24:39.686 --> 24:41.646
-Yeah.
-Who writes a comic book like that?

24:41.730 --> 24:43.190
-That's something--
-Mr. Dahmer.

24:43.273 --> 24:47.194
You've got to understand
the weight of what it's like

24:47.277 --> 24:49.029
representing somebody like Jeff.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.198
We got to stay focused here.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.992
We hold fast
and stick with the insanity plea.

24:54.659 --> 24:57.120
So, we do that, do we still
have to go through the whole trial?

24:57.204 --> 24:59.956
Yeah, and I think we will lean into it.

25:00.040 --> 25:03.084
We don't argue
the murders aren't gruesome. They are.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.086
I think that helps our case.

25:05.795 --> 25:08.381
The jury
has hereby determined

25:08.465 --> 25:11.176
that Mr. Dahmer was of sound mind

25:11.259 --> 25:12.969
and not legally insane…

25:14.137 --> 25:18.141
…with respect to all of the 15 counts

25:18.225 --> 25:20.519
of first-degree murder he's confessed to,

25:20.602 --> 25:24.147
which means his victims' families
can rest assured

25:24.231 --> 25:25.774
that he <i>will </i>be sent to prison.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.990
Court shall recess till Monday,

25:34.074 --> 25:36.576
at which time victims'
family members will be allowed

25:36.660 --> 25:38.828
to make impact statements to the court.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.831
And the defendant will be allowed
to make a statement of his own

25:41.915 --> 25:43.041
before sentencing.

25:43.124 --> 25:46.545
Court is adjourned
till Monday at 9:00 a.m.

26:12.195 --> 26:15.156
So that's it. Huh? You're leaving? Huh?

26:22.455 --> 26:23.999
What do you want me to say, Lionel?

26:24.082 --> 26:26.543
Well, I would like you to take
some responsibility, maybe.

26:26.626 --> 26:27.752
Lionel. Lionel.

26:27.836 --> 26:30.880
-Responsibility? What does that mean?
-Just what it means.

26:30.964 --> 26:33.091
So you're saying this is my fault?

26:33.174 --> 26:34.301
No. No, he's not.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.345
Yeah, well, as of now,
I'm taking the blame for this.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.139
Have you read what they said about me?

26:39.264 --> 26:41.266
I've not heard a word from you

26:41.349 --> 26:43.518
about the awful lies
they're spreading about me.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.479
I don't know what the hell you did
with him when I wasn't there.

26:46.563 --> 26:47.897
Oh, is that right?

26:47.981 --> 26:49.399
And you say I did this to him?

26:50.483 --> 26:53.069
Well, it is not my fault,
you son of a bitch!

26:53.153 --> 26:54.237
It's nobody's fault.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.698
-You think I did this to him…
-It's not about who's to blame.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.825
when you were cutting up roadkill with him

26:58.908 --> 27:01.036
in that fucking garage, Lionel?

27:01.119 --> 27:04.247
Yeah, just walk away, Joyce.
Just like you walked away from your son.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.373
Lionel.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.083
You still on those pills, huh?

27:07.167 --> 27:10.295
-How many you fucking taking? Huh?
-Lionel! Lionel! Stop it!

27:11.004 --> 27:12.380
Stop it.

27:13.173 --> 27:16.217
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
God. Oh God, forgive me.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.011
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.096
I'm so sorry.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.378
May I help you?

27:52.212 --> 27:53.421
Ms. Straughter?

27:53.505 --> 27:54.422
Yes.

27:55.006 --> 27:57.467
-I'm Joyce Flint. I'm--
-I know who you are.

27:58.968 --> 28:02.180
Is your daughter Dorothy here,
Curtis's mother?

28:02.263 --> 28:04.849
She's not. What is it you want, Ms. Flint?

28:06.226 --> 28:08.937
Well, first, let me just say how

28:10.313 --> 28:13.650
deeply, deeply sorry I am
for what happened.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.945
For what my son

28:18.363 --> 28:21.616
did to your grandson Curtis.

28:22.242 --> 28:25.495
I realize there's nothing I can say.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.165
It's unforgivable.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.293
Why are you here, Ms. Flint?

28:38.299 --> 28:41.219
I came here because

28:42.303 --> 28:45.932
I was hoping to speak to you
or your daughter

28:47.517 --> 28:48.727
as a mother.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.480
To ask if…

28:54.983 --> 28:58.319
if either of you might be willing

28:58.945 --> 29:01.364
to say something in court tomorrow

29:01.990 --> 29:03.658
on behalf of Jeff.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.535
On behalf of Jeff?

29:07.704 --> 29:12.709
That the judge might consider
sending him to a mental facility

29:12.792 --> 29:14.502
and not to prison.

29:15.962 --> 29:18.339
You want us to forgive your son?

29:19.340 --> 29:21.384
Ask the judge to forgive him?

29:21.468 --> 29:22.343
No.

29:27.682 --> 29:29.100
I feel for you, ma'am.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.394
Truly, I do.

29:32.687 --> 29:35.774
You want your truth as a mother
to be heard, I understand that.

29:36.941 --> 29:40.111
But maybe now it's time for you
to listen to somebody else's truth.

29:41.362 --> 29:42.489
You understand?

29:44.908 --> 29:47.076
<i>Let's hear</i>
<i>the first impact statement.</i>

29:56.252 --> 30:00.381
My family and I
came to this country by boat.

30:07.263 --> 30:10.350
We were poor,
but we were hopeful.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.521
American dream.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.649
We believed in the American dream.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.911
But now, we're living in a nightmare.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.627
And it's all because of Jeffrey Dahmer.

30:44.300 --> 30:46.636
He robbed us of our son, Konerak.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.768
He robbed us of our dream.

31:00.567 --> 31:04.320
My name is Shirley Hughes,
and I'm Tony Hughes's mother.

31:05.488 --> 31:08.116
I would like to say
to Jeffrey Dahmer that…

31:09.117 --> 31:13.037
he don't know the pain,
the hurt, the loss,

31:14.038 --> 31:17.000
and the mental state
he's put our family in.

31:18.001 --> 31:23.298
But I'd just like to read a poem
that a good friend of my son's wrote.

31:25.216 --> 31:27.594
"Why are you attacking me, Jeffrey?"

31:28.136 --> 31:29.929
"I thought you were my friend."

31:30.638 --> 31:34.225
"Why am I a victim
in your cruel and evil world?"

31:34.309 --> 31:36.686
"Look at the tears roll down my face."

31:36.769 --> 31:42.025
"See that each one is a cry for help,
and realize that I want to live."

31:42.108 --> 31:44.319
"What have I done to you

31:44.402 --> 31:47.780
to make you such a maniac,
to make you such a devil?"

31:48.364 --> 31:50.783
Why did this happen
to a person like Eddie?

31:53.077 --> 31:55.413
He gave so much and asked for so little.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.168
All he wanted was a chance to be himself.

32:02.211 --> 32:05.757
When you killed my brother, you killed

32:07.091 --> 32:10.178
my mother and father.

32:10.803 --> 32:11.930
<i>I beg you, Your Honor,</i>

32:12.013 --> 32:16.017
<i>don't let this man ever walk the streets</i>

32:16.100 --> 32:17.644
<i>or see daylight again.</i>

32:20.271 --> 32:21.564
Good morning, Honor.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.358
My name is Donald Bradehoft.

32:25.568 --> 32:26.569
I'm the…

32:28.196 --> 32:29.781
For the Bradehoft family.

32:32.033 --> 32:35.119
As much as love in our family closed,

32:36.496 --> 32:39.999
my mother gave five beautiful kids.

32:42.627 --> 32:43.544
We lost…

32:45.088 --> 32:48.007
He destroyed the baby of the family.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.219
And I hope you go to hell!

32:53.429 --> 32:55.014
I love this world.

32:55.515 --> 32:58.768
You guys did a wonderful job.

32:58.851 --> 33:01.938
Bottom of my heart, thank to God,

33:02.438 --> 33:04.148
I got a lot of strength.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.404
Thank you all.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.157
God bless America.

33:13.658 --> 33:18.371
I'll never get a chance again
to tell him that I loved him.

33:19.706 --> 33:23.376
You took my mother's
oldest grandchild from her.

33:23.459 --> 33:26.546
And for that, I can never forgive you.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.798
<i>"Mom, I'm gone.</i>"

33:29.465 --> 33:33.845
<i>"I know there's a dragon piercing</i>
<i>your heart day and night because of this,</i>

33:33.928 --> 33:36.014
but yet, I'm not far away."

33:37.432 --> 33:40.184
"Two fingers and one thumb

33:41.269 --> 33:43.938
means 'I love you' in sign language."

33:45.189 --> 33:46.733
"When you cry, Mom,

33:47.567 --> 33:50.862
place one teardrop outside
your window ledge,

33:50.945 --> 33:54.198
and when I pass by,
I'll exchange it for one of mine."

33:55.116 --> 33:57.368
"And then I'll always be with you."

33:58.619 --> 34:00.621
"Two fingers and one thumb."

34:01.205 --> 34:02.457
"Your son, Tony."

34:18.639 --> 34:20.183
My name is Rita Isbell,

34:20.266 --> 34:22.935
and I'm the oldest sister
of Errol Lindsay.

34:23.436 --> 34:26.564
Je-- Whatever your name is, Satan.

34:27.648 --> 34:29.067
I'm mad!

34:29.150 --> 34:32.028
This is how you act
when you are out of control?!

34:32.528 --> 34:35.948
Now, I don't want to ever have to see
my mother go through this again!

34:36.032 --> 34:37.116
Never, Jeffrey!

34:37.200 --> 34:40.620
Jeffrey, I hate you, motherfucker!

34:40.703 --> 34:41.829
I hate you!

34:41.913 --> 34:43.790
This is out of control!

34:44.290 --> 34:46.876
Don't fuck with me, Jeffrey!
I'll kill you, God damn it!

34:46.959 --> 34:49.921
Look at me! Look at me, motherfucker!

34:51.255 --> 34:54.509
Mr. Dahmer,
before I impose sentence,

34:54.592 --> 34:57.970
I understand you have a statement
you'd like to read?

34:58.054 --> 34:59.305
Yes, Your Honor.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.585
Your Honor, it is over now.

35:30.837 --> 35:33.631
This has never been a case
of trying to get free.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.759
I didn't ever want freedom.

35:37.718 --> 35:39.846
Frankly, I wanted death for myself.

35:41.639 --> 35:45.601
This was a case to tell the world
that I did what I did,

35:45.685 --> 35:47.311
not for reasons of hate.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.063
I hated no one.

35:49.647 --> 35:52.775
I knew I was sick or evil or both.

35:53.651 --> 35:55.236
Now I believe I was sick.

35:56.112 --> 35:58.948
The doctors have told me
about my sickness,

35:59.031 --> 36:00.908
and now I have some peace.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.870
I know how much harm I've caused,

36:04.370 --> 36:08.541
and I tried to do the best I could
after the arrest to make amends,

36:09.041 --> 36:10.668
but no matter what I did,

36:11.169 --> 36:13.880
I could not undo
the terrible harm I've caused.

36:14.463 --> 36:19.468
My attempt to help identify the remains
was the best that I could do.

36:19.969 --> 36:21.804
And that was hardly anything.

36:22.471 --> 36:25.641
I feel so bad
for what I did to those poor families,

36:26.309 --> 36:28.644
and I understand their rightful anger.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.356
I know I will be
in prison for the rest of my life…

36:42.617 --> 36:45.203
We're here outside
Milwaukee County Courthouse,

36:45.286 --> 36:48.164
where just moments ago,
Judge Laurence Gram

36:48.247 --> 36:53.711
sentenced serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer
to 15 consecutive life terms in prison,

36:53.794 --> 36:56.797
one life term for each
person he's accused of killing.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.090
You all right, Mama?

37:00.843 --> 37:03.137
Yeah, I'm good.

37:03.971 --> 37:06.724
We got that bastard. We got him.

37:07.934 --> 37:10.186
And he ain't never getting out.

37:25.326 --> 37:27.703
Guess I'm getting
what's coming to me, huh?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.122
Oh, son.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.379
-It's okay, Dad.
-Yeah.

37:36.462 --> 37:37.588
We tried our best.

37:37.672 --> 37:38.714
Listen, um,

37:39.799 --> 37:43.052
I know we only have a few minutes,
so there's something I gotta tell you.

37:43.761 --> 37:44.971
Um…

37:46.013 --> 37:48.349
Now, I've been looking everywhere

37:48.432 --> 37:50.518
to find out
who is responsible for all this,

37:51.018 --> 37:53.813
blaming everybody except myself.

37:55.606 --> 37:58.651
And it's me. I'm the one to blame.

37:59.235 --> 38:00.903
-Dad, you don't have to say that.
-Honey--

38:00.987 --> 38:03.531
Okay, shut up, Jeff.
Please just listen to me. Listen to me.

38:04.031 --> 38:05.700
It's me. I did this to you.

38:05.783 --> 38:09.370
<i>All that stuff with the dead animals,</i>
<i>I shouldn't have done that.</i>

38:09.453 --> 38:11.414
I shouldn't have showed you
how to do that.

38:11.497 --> 38:15.710
And your, uh, your fantasies
about killing people and stuff,

38:15.793 --> 38:20.214
I should have made you feel like
you could tell me about that stuff.

38:20.923 --> 38:22.008
You know?

38:24.510 --> 38:27.847
Because I had those same feelings.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.269
And I gave you that part of me.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.986
And I never really…

38:43.404 --> 38:45.656
helped you enough when you needed it.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.200
<i>When you went to prison,</i>
<i>I wrote a letter to the judge.</i>

38:48.284 --> 38:50.578
<i>I said, "My son needs help,"</i>
<i>'cause I knew you did,</i>

38:50.661 --> 38:54.623
but I just left it at that,
and that wasn't enough, and…

38:57.335 --> 38:59.086
I wasn't a good father.

39:01.130 --> 39:03.090
I wasn't, 'cause I wasn't a good husband.

39:03.674 --> 39:06.469
And you didn't feel safe.

39:12.308 --> 39:13.601
I left you alone.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.978
I can't believe
that I left you alone.

39:16.896 --> 39:20.441
Oh, I'm so--
I'm so sorry I left you alone.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.359
Time to go.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.820
And I'll… I'll never forgive myself.

39:25.696 --> 39:28.449
Okay, but I won't leave you again.

39:28.532 --> 39:32.119
I promise, son.
I'll… I'll make it up to you.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.247
I'll visit you every week, and I'll call.

39:46.133 --> 39:49.053
<i>I've known this was coming</i>
<i>for a long time now.</i>

39:50.221 --> 39:52.306
<i>There's so much I need to say.</i>

39:53.974 --> 39:57.103
<i>But I find it impossible</i>
<i>to put into words…</i>

39:58.187 --> 40:00.314
<i>…because it's all so horrible.</i>

40:02.608 --> 40:05.861
<i>Words can't express the scale of my grief.</i>

40:08.864 --> 40:13.661
<i>When I try to take responsibility</i>
<i>for the part I played in all of this,</i>

40:14.370 --> 40:16.997
<i>it is simply too painful to do so.</i>

40:19.625 --> 40:22.086
<i>But denying I had any part in it</i>

40:22.837 --> 40:25.756
<i>-is a comfort I can't allow myself.</i>

40:26.882 --> 40:29.093
<i>Because I know it isn't true.</i>

40:31.679 --> 40:33.389
<i>I failed you, Jeff,</i>

40:34.014 --> 40:37.726
<i>and I'm sorry</i>
<i>I wasn't the mother you needed.</i>

40:39.186 --> 40:43.524
<i>And I am no longer willing to live</i>
<i>with the guilt of that fact.</i>

40:44.817 --> 40:47.445
<i> To all of Jeff's victims,</i>

40:47.528 --> 40:51.824
<i>I cannot express to you</i>
<i>the magnitude of my regret.</i>

40:52.366 --> 40:55.244
<i>So it's pointless to even try.</i>

40:56.745 --> 41:01.000
<i>To my son David, please forgive me.</i>

41:01.083 --> 41:04.044
<i>You've been able</i>
<i>to rise above all of this,</i>

41:04.670 --> 41:07.298
<i>and I'm sorry that I'm not able to.</i>

41:08.215 --> 41:10.593
<i>I love you and your brother.</i>

41:13.387 --> 41:15.264
<i>I tried my best.</i>

41:25.149 --> 41:26.108
Sweetheart.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.486
Hold on.
I'm in the middle of a chapter here.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.988
When, uh, Jeff was…

41:31.489 --> 41:33.616
Remember that Christmas
before Jeff went in the Army?

41:33.699 --> 41:34.658
Okay, but--

41:34.742 --> 41:36.285
Just one second. One second.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.082
Oh, yeah,
how did I not know that writing a book

41:42.583 --> 41:45.461
is what I should've
been doing the whole time?

41:46.253 --> 41:47.713
I think I have a knack for it.

41:47.796 --> 41:51.342
Lionel, I just got off
the phone with David.

41:51.425 --> 41:52.718
She's okay.

41:53.511 --> 41:56.180
But he said
that Joyce tried to kill herself.

41:57.640 --> 41:58.974
Oh, Jesus.

42:00.684 --> 42:01.936
Oh, Jesus.

42:06.398 --> 42:07.274
She's okay, though?

42:08.651 --> 42:09.527
Yeah.

42:10.236 --> 42:11.070
Okay.

42:13.656 --> 42:14.657
I'll call him.

42:30.756 --> 42:31.757
Thank you, guys.

42:33.676 --> 42:35.678
We're glad to be back on the force.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.430
Thank you, uh, for all your support.

42:39.890 --> 42:42.643
It's meant a lot, and, uh…

42:44.019 --> 42:46.438
it was nice to know
that somebody has your back.

42:46.522 --> 42:47.648
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

42:50.401 --> 42:51.694
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

42:51.777 --> 42:54.238
-Good to see you, sir. How are you?
-Bobby!

42:54.321 --> 42:56.574
I appreciate the call, Mayor.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.785
Yes, so do I.

43:03.289 --> 43:04.790
-What happened?

43:05.624 --> 43:11.088
Those two cops who let that Konerak boy
go back to Jeffrey Dahmer,

43:12.172 --> 43:13.924
they've just been reinstated.

43:14.008 --> 43:14.883
What?

43:15.759 --> 43:17.720
A slap on the wrist and that's it?

43:17.803 --> 43:20.055
Mayor said
they're gonna appeal the decision.

43:20.139 --> 43:21.682
And if that fails?

43:23.267 --> 43:25.144
Then we…

43:26.228 --> 43:27.730
…fight the next fight.

43:29.315 --> 43:30.649
And the next fight.

43:34.695 --> 43:35.821
And the next.
