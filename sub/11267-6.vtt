figure that part out.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.766
We'll ask our friends
or something.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.268

for that kind of money.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.189
I'll find another way.

08:02.274 --> 08:05.319

find another way.

You know what,
don't be.

You know, Raj doesn't want
to take money from his friends,

08:41.270 --> 08:43.063
so fine, you know,
we'll just have to raise it.

contest is a great idea.

people that sign up will
actually be talented

Come on.
Okay, Annie,
it is your turn

09:03.543 --> 09:05.504
to play traveling
ticket saleswoman.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.838
Any tips?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.299
Yeah. Play up the potential
of watching deluded people

09:09.341 --> 09:10.550
make asses of themselves.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.634
And if that
doesn't work,

09:11.676 --> 09:13.636
you can always
do my little trick.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.347
(mock gasp)
Oh, no!

09:15.389 --> 09:17.057
(Annie and Ivy groan)

09:17.098 --> 09:18.808
Well, well, well,
is that your talent,

09:18.850 --> 09:21.395
or are you just
putting on a show?
Either way, I'm here

09:21.436 --> 09:24.772
to buy a couple of tickets.
I'm off to sell
tickets for Raj.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.608
Well, look who decides to take
time away from his trampy fling.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.361
Oh, but I'm not.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.863
Hi.
Sally, this is Naomi.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.281
Naomi, Sally.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.200
Hey, nice to meet you.
I think it's amazing

09:35.242 --> 09:36.784
what you guys are
doing for your friend.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.454
Well, pretty much
everything we do is amazing.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.457
It's a burden that way,
but, you know, we manage.

09:42.499 --> 09:46.002
Well, Austin always seems
to find such good, funny
people wherever he goes.

09:46.044 --> 09:46.920
(laughs)

09:46.961 --> 09:48.296
Oh, does he?

09:48.338 --> 09:51.883
Right. So, you guys want to sign
up for this talent show or what?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.385
There's a pretty sweet prize.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.845
Wow. Private
island, huh?
Mm-hmm.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.722
Sally's always had
a great voice.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.767
I have a voice that Austin's
always flattered me about!

10:00.808 --> 10:01.976
Come on, you saying you really

10:02.018 --> 10:03.644
wouldn't want
to go to that island? Huh?

10:03.686 --> 10:04.771
Come on.
Well, all right.

10:04.812 --> 10:05.772
There you go.

10:05.813 --> 10:06.898
Thanks.
Well, guess
I'd better

10:06.940 --> 10:08.858
go figure out
something to sing.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.110
It was so nice
meeting you.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.653
Pleasure.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.739
What a sweet girl.
Yeah, I know.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.033
I think it took meeting
the wrong kind of girl

10:17.075 --> 10:18.952
to make me realize
what I actually want.

10:18.993 --> 10:22.205
I've known Sally for
years, but lately,
she's all grown up.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.123
Uh-huh.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.207
And I can't think
of anybody else

10:24.249 --> 10:26.042
I'd rather stretch
out the days with,

10:26.084 --> 10:29.003
just laying around and
laughing and discovering
each other again.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.297
Oh.
(chuckles)

10:30.338 --> 10:32.257
Ladies.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.427
Oh, my God.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.220
I'm gonna sign up.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.221
Max and I

10:38.263 --> 10:39.931
are going to go to that island

10:39.973 --> 10:43.726
if it's the last thing
that we do.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.896
I wonder what I'm good at?

10:48.231 --> 10:50.275
(phone chimes)

10:57.115 --> 10:58.408
(laughs)

11:02.412 --> 11:04.372
Silver,

11:04.414 --> 11:06.166
what do you think about
making a piece

11:06.207 --> 11:07.917
about groundwater
pollution... Silver?

11:07.959 --> 11:09.169
Sorry. Yeah.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.212
Um, pollution,
sounds great.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.048
You seem a little distracted
and I think I know why.

11:16.635 --> 11:17.552
(sighs)

11:17.594 --> 11:19.638
That... Yeah, that's totally it.

11:19.678 --> 11:20.847
I'm sorry.

11:20.888 --> 11:21.973
It was really unprofessional

11:22.015 --> 11:23.016
of me to use the copy
machine for this.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.559
It-it's not going
to happen again.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.770
Silver, I think what
you're doing is great,

11:27.812 --> 11:29.730
and I would love
to be involved.
Really?

11:29.772 --> 11:30.940
I can make an appearance,

11:30.982 --> 11:33.276
and bring a little
press attention to it.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.363
Now I won't deny
it's great publicity for me,

11:36.404 --> 11:38.365
it would also
help your friend

11:38.406 --> 11:40.534
and maybe a lot of other people
in similar situations.

11:40.575 --> 11:41.993
Wow. Yeah.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.161
(phone chimes)
I mean, that would be...

11:43.203 --> 11:44.538
(phone beeps)

11:44.579 --> 11:47.040
Are you sure that's
the only thing bothering you?

11:47.081 --> 11:48.791
Yeah, no, absolutely.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.128
Okay.
Thanks.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.386
MAN (over radio):
Dixon Wilson,

11:59.427 --> 12:00.845
our emerging artist of the week.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.138
DIXON:
Thanks for having me, Billy.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.473
Ah, the interview
is on.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.559
BILLY: Uh, where can your
growing masses of fans

12:05.600 --> 12:06.851
hear from you next?

12:06.893 --> 12:08.186
DIXON: So if you like
what you just heard,

12:08.228 --> 12:09.937
you're going to love
what I'm playing this Friday.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.898
It's a benefit for my friend Raj
who's fighting cancer,

12:11.939 --> 12:13.567
and it's at this great place
called Offshore.

12:13.608 --> 12:16.110
And hey, with a ticket
you get unlimited free drinks.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.029
Whoa, whoa, free drinks?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.280
What's he doing?

12:19.322 --> 12:20.948
I don't know, I
guess he's excited.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.535
He's been pretty amped-up
lately, don't you think?

12:23.577 --> 12:25.412
I guess.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.497
What's the matter?

12:27.539 --> 12:28.831
It's just, when I told Ivy

12:28.873 --> 12:30.041
the bar would host
this benefit thing,

12:30.083 --> 12:31.209
I thought it was going to be
like a hundred people,

12:31.251 --> 12:33.002
but it's getting big.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.004
Which is great for Raj,
but with the press

12:35.046 --> 12:37.257
and Dixon giving out
drinks like a maniac,

12:37.298 --> 12:39.509
I don't know
if I can afford this.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.052
We could have a bake sale.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.470
Are you serious?

12:42.512 --> 12:43.971
No.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.973
(laughs)

12:46.015 --> 12:47.308
Hey, if you
really need money,

12:47.350 --> 12:49.936
sell what people want.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.816
I thought Leila loved Korean
barbeque on her birthday.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.360
Not since I was,
like, 16.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.029
Yeah, well, it wasn't
the perfect night for
me, either, okay?

13:00.071 --> 13:02.198
We don't always
get what we want.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.908
(humming happily)

13:03.950 --> 13:05.993
Oh! Oh, my God.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.123
Property of...
Don't you get it?

13:10.164 --> 13:12.208
They're for riding
on Darius' motorcycle.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.585
Whoa, whoa, Darius?

13:13.627 --> 13:14.835
Darius is gone.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.212
Why?

13:16.254 --> 13:18.131
Because you paid him
to leave?

13:18.172 --> 13:20.717
We've been texting,
and he told me everything.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.885
Just goes to show, not everyone
is a slave to money,

13:22.927 --> 13:24.304
like you are.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.723
No, Leila, there is no way that
you're dating this guy, okay?

13:26.765 --> 13:28.182
I'm 18 now, Navid.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.644
I can legally have sex
with whoever I want.

13:30.685 --> 13:33.146
The money I borrowed,
Silver moving out,

13:33.187 --> 13:35.189
everything I've gotten
myself into

13:35.231 --> 13:36.483
was all to get rid
of that jackass.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.778
Darius always says,
love is like a flaming tractor:

13:39.818 --> 13:43.197
you try and stop it,
you might get burned.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.866
I'm gonna go try on
my new pants.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.793
ANNIE:
And I think

13:54.833 --> 13:56.336
the cabdriver
was also playing

13:56.377 --> 13:59.380
some weird
self-hypnosis tape.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.340
I... I don't know.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.801
So he just
hypnotized himself

14:02.841 --> 14:03.926
into completely disregarding
the speed limit?

14:03.968 --> 14:05.553
Exactly. And I think
it kind of worked on me, too,

14:05.595 --> 14:07.639
'cause I left
feeling strangely relaxed.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.307
You know, I think he's got a
potentially really great service

14:09.349 --> 14:10.849
on his hands-- by the time
you get to the airport,

14:10.891 --> 14:12.935
you're completely over
your fear of flying.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.480
Yeah. And your fear
of missing your flight.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.399
But at least I got here
before everybody else.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.151
Except you, obviously.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.612
Oh, there's no everyone
else, just me.

14:22.654 --> 14:26.282
Wait, Bree sent me here
to meet with just you?

14:26.324 --> 14:27.659
Yeah.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.453
I called her like I usually
do when I'm in town.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.996
She sends someone to my hotel,

14:32.038 --> 14:34.999
we have dinner,
and, uh...

14:35.041 --> 14:37.544
Oh-oh-oh, my God, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.045
I thought yesterday
was the worst day of my life,

14:39.086 --> 14:41.339
and now this.
I don't do this.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.383
I don't care
how bad I need money,

14:43.424 --> 14:45.468

I-I'm doing great,
I'm doing fantastic.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.706
Caring about
your career success

15:56.748 --> 15:58.416
more than you're caring
about yourself

15:58.458 --> 15:59.584
is really dangerous.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.419
Look, Ade, I'm really getting
sick and tired

of all of your concern

16:02.962 --> 16:04.798

Uh, if you're jealous, you can
just keep it to yourself.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.802
I'm not jealous,
I'm trying to protect you.

16:08.843 --> 16:12.305
Okay, I went down that road,
and I lost everything.

16:12.346 --> 16:15.141
My money, my friends.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.477
Yeah, you kind of brought that

Now I panic
every time I try.

It feels like I'm choking.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.076
Don't you understand?

16:34.118 --> 16:37.580
I was so wrapped up
with the idea of being famous

16:37.622 --> 16:41.083
that I lost the one thing
that I loved most.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.378
I really don't want to see that
happen to you.

We're done.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.323
What are you
talking about?

17:12.365 --> 17:14.784
I've lost everything
because of you.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.618
I've lost the only person
that...

17:19.747 --> 17:21.374
It doesn't matter.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.376
Nothing you can do
to me matters anymore.

was that?

17:50.028 --> 17:52.196
You set me up with
just one guy?

17:52.238 --> 17:54.281
You said you needed
something fast.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.534
Yeah, but I meant like a
regular thing, like a group.

man at his hotel.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.788
For dinner.

18:02.373 --> 18:03.833

18:03.875 --> 18:05.084
Everybody likes him.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.669

18:06.711 --> 18:10.423
He wants to take you to lunch
before he leaves town.

18:10.464 --> 18:11.632

Yeah, which is really weird.

18:13.885 --> 18:18.014
Oh.
Because he's never asked
for a specific girl before.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.599
Well, whatever.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.685
That is totally immaterial
because there's still no way

18:22.727 --> 18:25.145

Also, he has your jacket.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.523

This is working, guys.
I'm liking what I'm seeing.

Perfect.

Fine, just get in there.

He's looking
a little lost.

18:58.429 --> 19:01.057
There, just act like
you're working on the
carburetor, all right?

19:01.099 --> 19:04.018
I would never use a lug wrench
to work on the carburetor.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.104
Just hold the damn thing
and flex.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.858

Yeah, you're right.

As long as find
something that actually
will win us the prize,

29:12.751 --> 29:14.420
really amazing!

29:14.461 --> 29:16.046
And judging by our
audience's reaction,

29:16.088 --> 29:18.965
I think we have a clear winner--
The Magnificent Naomi

29:19.007 --> 29:21.343
and Her Lovely
Magician, Max!

29:21.385 --> 29:23.512
(applause, whooping, whistling)

29:24.971 --> 29:26.306
(audience shouts)
Wow.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.601
(applause, whistling)

29:36.024 --> 29:37.901
Well, it looks like
you were good,
Hey.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.070
but not quite
good enough.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.155
(Naomi laughs)

29:43.115 --> 29:45.200
Can you believe it?
We won!

29:46.118 --> 29:48.662
Yeah, yeah, look, we...

29:48.704 --> 29:50.706
we did, we... we won.

29:50.748 --> 29:52.332
We won!
Why are you not excited?

29:52.374 --> 29:54.543
You should be excited.
'Cause.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.797
I can't be the guy
you want me to be.

29:58.838 --> 30:01.133
Max, I know you're a nerd--
I love that about you.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.718
Naomi, it's not that.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.719
I can't...

30:03.761 --> 30:05.763
be the guy who doesn't care

30:05.804 --> 30:07.973
that you're into somebody else.

30:08.014 --> 30:09.391
What?

30:15.147 --> 30:18.567
Max! Max, wait.
I'm not stupid, Naomi.

30:18.609 --> 30:21.027
I know you have
feelings for Austin.
No, I don't.

30:21.069 --> 30:22.738
Okay, listen,

30:22.780 --> 30:24.030
you have to believe me.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.824
Whatever... crazy feeling

30:25.865 --> 30:27.326
possesses me sometimes,

30:27.367 --> 30:30.287
I love you.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.623
I love you, too.

30:32.665 --> 30:35.208
You are the queen
of my heart.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.753
(laughs)
But...

30:37.795 --> 30:40.213
I can't be okay with this.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.882
Max...
No, I really tried to.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.135
I can't.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.679
I'm sorry.

30:46.720 --> 30:49.014
(sobbing)
Max...

30:50.223 --> 30:51.391
Max!

30:52.851 --> 30:54.561
Max!

30:56.021 --> 30:57.147
Hey, guys.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.691
Sorry I'm late.
Hey.

30:58.732 --> 30:59.941
Looks like an
incredible turnout.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.443
Yeah. I honestly

31:01.485 --> 31:03.945
cannot believe this many people
are willing to help me.

31:03.987 --> 31:07.115
Well, you just had
to let them.

31:07.157 --> 31:09.117
Ivy...

31:09.159 --> 31:11.077
if I stay alive...

31:11.119 --> 31:13.038
it's because of you.

31:13.079 --> 31:16.709
And I feel alive because of you.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.050
All right.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.386
Stick around, everybody,
because our headliner,

31:27.427 --> 31:29.555
Dixon Wilson,
is coming up next.

31:29.596 --> 31:32.558
(applause, cheering
and whistling)

31:37.937 --> 31:40.774
Dixon, they're kind
of waiting for you.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.860
Are you okay?

31:42.901 --> 31:44.486
Yeah. (sniffles)

31:44.528 --> 31:46.864
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...
I just need a minute.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.281
You're not fine.

31:48.323 --> 31:50.992
Dixon! Your nose
is bleeding.

31:51.034 --> 31:52.703
Oh, my God.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.374
(sighs)

31:57.416 --> 32:00.001
I-I-I... I got to get out there.

32:00.043 --> 32:02.504
Those people paid money
to see me.

32:02.546 --> 32:04.423
What if they ask for their money
back? I can't do that to Raj.

32:04.464 --> 32:08.260
Well, you going out there like
this is not gonna help Raj.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.511
Okay, just...

32:09.553 --> 32:11.764
CROWD (chanting):
Dixon! Dixon! Dixon!

32:11.805 --> 32:14.391
I'll take care of it, okay?

32:14.433 --> 32:15.934
CROWD:
Dixon! Dixon...!

32:15.975 --> 32:17.519
SILVER:
So, I'm sure

32:17.561 --> 32:19.062
Dixon will be coming out
any minute.

32:19.104 --> 32:22.858
Um, in the meantime, is anybody
a fan of e.e. cummings?

32:22.900 --> 32:24.359
(laughs)
(man whoops)

32:24.401 --> 32:26.779
No?

32:26.820 --> 32:28.071
Um...

32:30.490 --> 32:32.451
What's going on?

32:32.492 --> 32:35.328
Dixon's not feeling well, and
he doesn't want to let Raj down,

32:35.370 --> 32:37.163
so I'm going to
take his place.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.291
You've got to be kidding me.

32:39.332 --> 32:41.960
I mean, somebody's got to go on.
Do you want to?

32:42.001 --> 32:44.003
(sighs)

32:45.839 --> 32:47.633
Um,

32:47.674 --> 32:49.134
unfortunately,

32:49.175 --> 32:50.510
Dixon's a little
under the weather,

32:50.552 --> 32:52.053
but filling in,

32:52.095 --> 32:54.598
very unexpectedly--

32:54.640 --> 32:57.183
Adrianna Tate-Duncan!

32:58.602 --> 33:01.772
(scattered applause)

33:03.148 --> 33:06.109
Hi. I'm Adrianna,

33:06.151 --> 33:09.905
and I'm going to play you
some of my new material.

33:09.947 --> 33:12.365
MAN:
Did you steal this one, too?

33:12.407 --> 33:14.785

What the hell do you want?

33:43.104 --> 33:45.774
I want you to reconsider
your decision, Navid.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.192
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

33:47.233 --> 33:49.319
Like I said, you can do whatever
you want to me, but I'm done.

33:49.361 --> 33:53.072
You're family,
and I would never hurt family.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.574
But she is not family.

33:54.616 --> 33:57.035
Wait? Who?
Who are you talking about?

33:57.076 --> 33:58.453
Who?

33:58.495 --> 34:01.373

(cheering and whistling swell)

35:02.809 --> 35:04.352
Give me your wallet.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.145
Are you mugging me?

35:06.187 --> 35:08.314
Just give it to me.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.028
Huh.

35:15.697 --> 35:17.365
There's no money here.

35:17.407 --> 35:18.951
You're not paying for anything.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.619
I like you,

35:20.660 --> 35:23.121
and I want to be with you,

35:23.162 --> 35:24.539
because

35:24.581 --> 35:28.501
when we kiss,
I felt alive with you, too.

35:44.434 --> 35:47.896
My name is, uh, Navid Shirazi.

35:47.938 --> 35:49.940
I'm here to, uh,

35:49.982 --> 35:52.442
turn myself in.

36:01.284 --> 36:04.412
Well, you are gonna have to sing
at another benefit for Liam

36:04.454 --> 36:06.372
to pay for all the beer
he just gave away.

36:06.414 --> 36:09.042
Yeah, I think that
was a one-time deal.

36:09.084 --> 36:12.337
Huh. That was Winter,
the modeling agent.

36:12.378 --> 36:14.714
She says she's got a
bigger check for me.

36:14.756 --> 36:16.925
That must mean
you made the ad.

36:16.967 --> 36:18.802
Well, congratulations, man.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.763
Looks like Raj isn't the only
one that's gonna live, huh?

36:21.805 --> 36:24.933
You guys have
a good night, okay?

36:24.975 --> 36:29.312
Here, go to the stupid
romantic island.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.605
What are you talking about?

36:30.647 --> 36:32.149
Max broke up with me,

36:32.231 --> 36:33.900
so we won't be going.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.902
That means you and your perfect
little girlfriend get to go.

36:35.944 --> 36:37.904
Oh, you thought Sally
was my girlfriend?

36:37.946 --> 36:39.823
Oh, that's, uh...
that's my bad, I guess.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.033
Um, she's just my cousin.

36:41.074 --> 36:43.660
She's just been staying
with me for the week.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.495
Here.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.636
SILVER:
Hey, Navid.

37:01.678 --> 37:03.013
It's me.

37:03.055 --> 37:06.099
Uh, look, I don't know
where you ran off to but...

37:06.141 --> 37:08.185
just give me a call.

37:12.313 --> 37:15.567
That was the real
distraction, wasn't it?

37:15.608 --> 37:17.652
Boyfriend troubles?

37:17.694 --> 37:19.196
How did you know?

37:19.237 --> 37:21.447
I'm not all work all the time.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.116
I've been there.

37:23.158 --> 37:28.080
I had a boyfriend who I was so
sure was messing around on me,

37:28.121 --> 37:30.540
and I spent a
year walking around

37:30.582 --> 37:32.625
with my head half in the game

37:32.667 --> 37:34.836
because I was always
wondering where he was,

37:34.878 --> 37:36.421
or who he was with.

37:36.462 --> 37:38.006
Why he didn't answer
his phone.

37:39.091 --> 37:41.051
Yeah.

37:41.093 --> 37:42.719
I mean, this thing with Navid--

37:42.761 --> 37:46.556
it's not exactly
the same, but...

37:46.598 --> 37:48.516
We had this moment earlier

37:48.558 --> 37:51.228
where I thought everything
was going to be okay,

37:51.269 --> 37:52.604
thought I could trust him again.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.564
And now I'm thinking,

37:54.606 --> 37:57.734
maybe he was just telling me
what I wanted to hear.

37:57.776 --> 38:01.154
Look, I don't... I don't
know your boyfriend

38:01.196 --> 38:05.117
or the situation, but
Silver, you can't trust

38:05.158 --> 38:08.494
someone because you want to.

38:08.536 --> 38:11.081
It's either you do,
or you don't.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.793
(sighs)

38:14.834 --> 38:17.462
I-I... I know... I know
I don't have any proof

38:17.503 --> 38:18.838
of the stolen cars, okay?

38:18.880 --> 38:20.173
But he threatened my girlfriend.

38:20.215 --> 38:22.259
Look.

38:23.218 --> 38:25.470
I'm just seeing a photo.

38:25.511 --> 38:27.680
No. Because he
specifically called me,

38:27.722 --> 38:29.808
and he sent the...

38:34.813 --> 38:36.898
He made sure
I have no actual proof.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.818
He's gonna hurt her.

38:39.859 --> 38:42.028
He's a dangerous criminal, okay?

38:42.070 --> 38:43.905
You got to believe me.

38:43.947 --> 38:47.075
I do, but I can't do anything
to protect you

38:47.117 --> 38:49.535
or your girlfriend
without hard evidence.

38:51.204 --> 38:53.039
Which we could get...

38:53.081 --> 38:55.167
if you got back
in business with him.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.918
What do you mean?

38:56.960 --> 38:59.754
The only way you're safe is
if your uncle's behind bars.

38:59.796 --> 39:02.423
That means building a case
against him from the inside.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.301
Get back in,
win his trust.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.885
(sighs)

39:05.927 --> 39:08.346
Work with the police
to get the evidence we need.

39:08.387 --> 39:09.764
But Navid,

39:09.806 --> 39:11.724
if you're uncle is
as dangerous as you say,

39:11.766 --> 39:14.102
people will get hurt if
he finds out what you're doing.

39:14.144 --> 39:16.313
You can't tell anyone.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.106
Especially not your girlfriend.

39:18.148 --> 39:19.774
So...

39:19.816 --> 39:20.817
you know, think about it,

39:20.859 --> 39:22.652
and if it's something
that you want to...

39:22.694 --> 39:25.071
No, no, I don't need
to think about it.

39:25.113 --> 39:28.116
I'm in.

39:28.158 --> 39:31.328
RAJ:
I can't believe
we actually raised the money.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.372
Are you sure you don't want
to spend it on something fancy

39:34.413 --> 39:35.832
like diamond man-jewelry?

39:35.874 --> 39:38.084
Nope. I got everything
I need right here.

39:38.126 --> 39:40.003
(laughs)

39:40.045 --> 39:41.420
IVY:
Uh-oh.

39:41.462 --> 39:43.173
Is someone just
getting home?

39:43.215 --> 39:44.507
All right,
who's the guy?

39:44.549 --> 39:45.758
Just a guy.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.219
Really.
Mm.

39:47.260 --> 39:48.970
Would his name
happen to be, um...

39:49.012 --> 39:50.847
(clears throat)
Patrick, by chance?

39:50.889 --> 39:52.640
Yeah, actually.

39:52.682 --> 39:54.309
Uh, how did you know that?

39:54.351 --> 39:56.602
Because someone
named Patrick Westhill

39:56.644 --> 39:58.313
made a ridiculously gigantic

39:58.355 --> 40:00.232
donation in
your name.

40:00.273 --> 40:03.276
We would never have made it
over the goal line without it.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.486
This guy must think
you're a pretty hot commodity.

40:05.528 --> 40:09.157
Yeah, something like that.

40:13.703 --> 40:15.538
It was kind of weird.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.665
Thought you'd
have an office.

40:17.707 --> 40:20.168
I do. I just thought
this would be more fun.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.506
$10,000?
Mm-hmm.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.466
This is a joke, right?

40:27.508 --> 40:29.427
No. They loved your picture
so much,

40:29.468 --> 40:33.014
I think you could work
a whole lot more.

40:33.056 --> 40:37.185
You might not love modeling,
but the camera loves you.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.201
Wow. You look like crap.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.789
Yeah, well,
I feel like crap, too.

40:59.332 --> 41:01.459
Uh, thanks for what
you did last night.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.169
And I'm...

41:03.211 --> 41:04.963
I'm sorry
for calling you jealous.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.131
(sniffles)

41:06.172 --> 41:07.382
I don't know.

41:07.424 --> 41:10.676
I guess I've just been working
too hard lately.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.511
It's okay.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.639
So we're cool?

41:14.680 --> 41:17.016
No, we're not.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.811
Dixon, you have a drug problem.

41:19.852 --> 41:24.441
You really need help.
