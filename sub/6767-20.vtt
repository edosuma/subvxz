00:49.591 --> 00:51.384
Yeah.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.343
(panting)

00:52.427 --> 00:53.636
{\an3}Why don't you relax,
sweetheart.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.013
And go back to
sleep, come on.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.557
No, I can't.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.518
{\an1}My mother's coming back
from San Francisco today.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.772
{\an1}I don't think
I can deal with it.

01:03.855 --> 01:07.150
Well, you have to face it.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.527
You have to face it all.

All we need is a segue

04:15.088 --> 04:16.673
from the chancellor's
presentation

04:16.755 --> 04:18.591
to the good nights.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.677
{\an1}Maybe you could bring the
chancellor over to the desk

04:20.760 --> 04:22.679
{\an1}and we could do it all
in a three shot?

04:22.762 --> 04:24.013
That's a good idea.
Trace?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.682
What?

04:26.891 --> 04:27.850
Is that okay with you?

04:27.934 --> 04:30.895
Yeah, just tell me what
you want and I'll do it.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.022
Fine, that's what I want.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.984
Sounds like a great
hundredth broadcast to me.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.569
{\an3}I wish we all shared
your enthusiasm.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.321
{\an3}Okay, everybody,
that's it.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.864
Good luck tonight.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.747
What was that all about?

04:49.831 --> 04:50.999
What was that all about?

04:51.082 --> 04:52.834
I don't know if you
noticed, but I was

04:52.917 --> 04:54.544
having a production
meeting over here.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.004
And I'd appreciate
a little support.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.296
Okay, well, maybe
you can give me

04:57.380 --> 04:58.881
{\an1}some tips on how
I'm supposed to act.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.050
You know, I've never really
been in a situation before

05:01.134 --> 05:02.051
where my boyfriend's keeping

05:02.135 --> 05:03.511
an engagement ring
for somebody else.

05:03.594 --> 05:04.512
{\an3}You think I should
have brought that up

05:04.595 --> 05:05.471
at the production meeting?

05:05.555 --> 05:06.764
Well, when were you
going to bring it up?

05:06.848 --> 05:08.725
{\an1}Or was that,
"don't worry, it doesn't

05:08.808 --> 05:10.727
mean anything" all the
explanation I was going to get?

05:10.810 --> 05:13.354
Trace,
(clears throat)

05:13.438 --> 05:14.856
I knew that we were going to

05:14.939 --> 05:16.357
have to talk about this.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.859
I've been thinking
about it all week.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.736
Yeah, well, obviously,
I'm just not as good

05:19.819 --> 05:21.738
at keeping things in little
compartments like you are.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.905
{\an3}I just thought
it would be best

05:22.989 --> 05:24.073
if we talked about it

05:24.157 --> 05:25.533
after the show, that's all.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.785
You didn't think it was
important enough to tell me.

05:27.869 --> 05:28.661
Maybe I shouldn't even

05:28.745 --> 05:30.413
{\an1}be there at all;
that way you can control

05:30.496 --> 05:32.790
both sides of the conversation
like you always do anyway.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.460
You know, Trace, if you don't
want to do this, that's fine.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.754
You have no idea how much
I don't want to do this.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.255
But if you mean the show,

05:39.338 --> 05:40.965
don't worry about it.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.425
I'll be there.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.052
With bells on.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.095
{\an1}Your hair looks
so good this color.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.722
Thanks.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.766
{\an3}I just felt like I needed
some kind of change.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.893
So, are you going to go
to Brandon's big night?

05:51.976 --> 05:52.935
I don't know.

05:53.019 --> 05:53.936
I'm supposed
to see Cliff.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.646
Well, aren't you afraid
David might be there?

05:55.730 --> 05:57.398
{\an3}Yep.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.942
It's just awkward, you know?

06:00.026 --> 06:01.277
We're all friends and....

06:01.360 --> 06:03.404
You know, everyone thinks of

06:03.488 --> 06:04.947
{\an3}David and me
like we're one word.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.033
Donnandavid, Davidandonna.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.619
{\an3}I just wish I could
live my own life.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.913
Well, maybe you should just
live it more privately.

06:11.996 --> 06:15.458
If David had wanted to
apologize, he could've.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.751
What's he gonna say?

06:16.834 --> 06:17.960
I'm sorry you were
seeing some other guy

06:18.044 --> 06:18.836
while you were seeing me?

06:18.920 --> 06:20.963
It was a misunderstanding,
not a date.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.341
Unlike tonight.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.099
Steve, can I ask you a question?

06:31.182 --> 06:32.767
{\an3}That's what big
brothers are for.

06:32.850 --> 06:33.684
It's about a girl.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.520
Oh, my specialty.

06:35.603 --> 06:36.562
Her name is Katie.

06:36.646 --> 06:37.814
I think she likes me.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.233
Well, just because she's a poor
judge of character doesn't mean

06:40.316 --> 06:41.400
{\an3}you should hold it
against her.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.985
Shut up, it took me a month

06:43.069 --> 06:44.821
to get up the courage
to ask her out.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.322
I want to do something special.

06:46.405 --> 06:47.657
(snaps fingers)
Santa Monica Pier.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.784
Once I took Clare there,
we got stuck on top of

06:49.867 --> 06:52.411
the Ferris wheel
for hours, it was...

06:53.830 --> 06:55.998
It's a good time.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.542
Sounds great.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.335
I'm just so nervous,

06:59.418 --> 07:00.795
I'll probably blow it.

07:00.878 --> 07:01.712
{\an3}I'll tell you what,
I got this thing

07:01.796 --> 07:03.464
at the CUTV station
tonight with Clare.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.507
Should be done early.

07:04.590 --> 07:05.675
What do you say we meet up?

07:05.758 --> 07:06.843
{\an3}Have a little
double datskie?

07:06.926 --> 07:08.302
That'd be totally cool.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.846
You sure you don't mind?

07:09.929 --> 07:10.972
{\an3}That's what big brothers
are for, right?

07:11.055 --> 07:11.973
{\an1}You know,
usually I talk

07:12.056 --> 07:13.391
to Austin about these things,

07:13.474 --> 07:15.017
but his idea of a special night

07:15.101 --> 07:16.853
is watching
<i>Topless Pizza Party 3.</i>

07:16.936 --> 07:18.646
You know I was in that.
(doorbell chiming)

07:18.729 --> 07:19.856
I had a small but pivotal role

07:19.939 --> 07:21.566
as a pizza delivery boy.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.777
{\an1}Ivan Trotz is a very
interesting filmmaker.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.825
Hello, Steve.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.535
{\an1}Abby, hi, come in.
Thanks.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.995
{\an1}You know, I'm not
sure Valerie's here.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.246
I just got home myself.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.330
{\an1}VAL:
I'm here.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.748
Hi, sweetheart.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.750
{\an1}Uh, I hope you don't
mind a full house.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.210
{\an1}I've got my little brother
staying with us.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.670
The more, the merrier.

07:42.753 --> 07:43.421
{\an3}STEVE: Great, I'm gonna
make sure he doesn't

07:43.504 --> 07:44.547
{\an3}eat us out of
house and home.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.090
Nice to see you again.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.552
Well, I'm glad somebody
feels that way.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.680
Aren't you going
to say something?

07:52.763 --> 07:54.307
Well, after what
I said last week,

07:54.390 --> 07:55.600
I'm surprised you're here.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.227
You must want
the money really bad.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.896
What I want is for us to behave

07:59.979 --> 08:01.522
like mother and daughter.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.566
Well, those are two things
you're not going to get from me.

08:03.649 --> 08:06.569
I'd hoped you'd
changed your mind

08:06.652 --> 08:08.404
about signing the papers
for the second mortgage.

08:08.487 --> 08:10.031
I didn't.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.032
Anything else?

08:11.115 --> 08:13.451
No. That about covers it.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.204
{\an3}I'll fly back to Buffalo
tomorrow morning

08:16.287 --> 08:17.580
{\an3}and put the house
up for sale.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.081
Thank Steve for his offer,

08:19.165 --> 08:20.124
but I think both you and I

08:20.208 --> 08:22.585
would be more comfortable
if I stayed in a hotel.

08:22.668 --> 08:23.711
{\an1}Well, it's
nice to know

08:23.794 --> 08:24.879
that you're not
completely insensitive.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.130
{\an3}Valerie,

08:26.214 --> 08:27.381
I'm trying to reach out to you.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.591
Why do you keep pushing me away?

08:28.674 --> 08:29.592
You're right.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.718
I could do something for you.

08:30.801 --> 08:31.969
I can drive you to your hotel.

08:32.053 --> 08:32.970
{\an3}No, thanks.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.597
I'll find a cab.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.640
(sighs)

08:36.724 --> 08:38.476
(door opens)

08:39.477 --> 08:40.561
(door shuts)

08:40.645 --> 08:42.063
(sighs heavily)

08:45.066 --> 08:47.276
{\an3}I'm very proud to
present this plaque

08:47.360 --> 08:51.239
commemorating the 100th
broadcast of the CUTV Newscast

08:51.322 --> 08:53.741
to our News Director and
Acting Station Manager,

08:53.824 --> 08:55.076
Brandon Walsh.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.078
{\an1}Brandon, your hard
work, your integrity

08:57.161 --> 08:59.664
{\an1}and your determination
have made us very proud.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.958
Here's to the next
hundred broadcasts.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.084
Thank you, sir.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.962
{\an1}I'd just like to say that
the success of our broadcast

09:06.045 --> 09:08.130
{\an1}is due to the
efforts of our crew

09:08.214 --> 09:09.423
both on the air and off.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.426
So, uh, if you'll
just follow me...

09:14.887 --> 09:17.306
I'd like to present
this award to our staff.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.517
And Tracy, since you're
the only one wearing makeup,

09:19.600 --> 09:21.477
{\an3}maybe you would be
good enough to accept it.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.311
I'd be happy to.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.146
Thank you very much.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.606
Chancellor Arnold.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.276
So, that's it from CUTV News.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.319
100 broadcasts and counting.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.946
From all of us here,

09:32.029 --> 09:35.324
this is Brandon Walsh
and Tracy Gaylian saying...

09:35.408 --> 09:37.785
Just read the cue card, sir.

09:37.868 --> 09:39.495
{\an3}Hmm?
The cue card.

09:39.578 --> 09:41.289
Oh, oh, uh,

09:41.372 --> 09:43.207
good night and good news.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.001
Now let's party!

09:45.084 --> 09:46.335
{\an3}Not the part
in parentheses.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.336
What?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.130
Oh!
(applause)

09:53.634 --> 09:54.802
DIRECTOR:
And we're out.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.476
{\an6}Yay!
Great show,
Chancellor.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.020
{\an4}Would you like
something to eat?
Yeah, sure.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.229
{\an5}Thanks, Steve.
I'll get you
a plate.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.814
Okay, thanks.
I'll go with you, Cliff.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.358
Well, see, no one seems upset
that I'm not here with David.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.401
I know, you're right.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.402
{\an3}I'm sorry.

10:11.485 --> 10:12.695
{\an3}What are you doing
after this?

10:12.778 --> 10:13.612
Uh, I don't know.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.531
Do you want to come
with us to the pier?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.158
{\an1}Yeah, sure.
Actually, let's go.

10:17.241 --> 10:17.950
After everything
that's happened,

10:18.034 --> 10:20.077
{\an1}this place is
kind of creepy to me.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.704
Okay.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.706
So, did you talk
to your mother?

10:23.789 --> 10:27.084
I couldn't.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.837
I know, I was all ready to,

10:29.920 --> 10:31.714
{\an1}but once I got
face-to-face to her,

10:31.797 --> 10:34.050
{\an1}I just wanted it to be over
as quickly as possible.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.093
{\an3}Well, that's not
what we talked about.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.345
What are you, my shrink?

10:37.428 --> 10:38.387
Val...

10:38.471 --> 10:40.222
{\an1}Tom, just give it
a rest, okay?

10:42.975 --> 10:44.560
Well, Kelly Taylor,

10:44.644 --> 10:46.062
as I live and breathe.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.396
Hey!
You look great.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.231
Thanks, so do you.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.858
Thanks.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.735
How are you?

10:52.818 --> 10:54.111
Fine.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.238
How are you?

10:56.322 --> 10:58.240
Good, good.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.241
Good, and Tracy?

10:59.325 --> 11:00.534
Fine.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.203
Good.

11:02.286 --> 11:04.246
(snickering)

11:04.330 --> 11:06.248
So...
(clears throat)

11:06.332 --> 11:08.250
great show.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.210
{\an1}Yeah.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.419
Yeah, it, uh,

11:10.503 --> 11:12.004
it was okay.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.882
{\an3}I hardly ever see
you anymore.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.094
I should, uh...

11:18.177 --> 11:20.554
{\an3}have you and Tracy over
for a barbecue or something.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.765
Yeah, yeah, that would be, uh...

11:22.848 --> 11:24.100
that'd be good.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.393
That'd be a lot of fun.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.395
Absolutely.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.771
Hey, Trace.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.773
{\an1}Kel just, uh, invited us
over for dinner.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.817
Yeah. You were
great tonight.

11:32.900 --> 11:33.984
Thanks.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.236
I'm gonna go.

11:35.319 --> 11:36.904
I'm not really in the mood
for a party.

11:36.987 --> 11:37.863
What are you talking about?

11:37.947 --> 11:40.116
We were supposed to talk
after the broadcast.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.117
But obviously,

11:41.200 --> 11:42.660
this conversation
is more important to you.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.537
Ooh. Did I, uh,

11:44.620 --> 11:46.080
get in the middle
of something here?

11:46.163 --> 11:47.581
No, no, you didn't.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.583
Anyway, I'm gonna go.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.670
And here, you can have
your precious plaque back.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.088
{\an3}I gave it to you.
Well, you're

11:54.171 --> 11:55.256
the one with all the integrity.

11:55.339 --> 11:56.549
Isn't that
what the chancellor said?

11:57.800 --> 11:59.093
You know, if he's so virtuous,

11:59.176 --> 12:00.803
why can't he tell the truth?

12:00.886 --> 12:01.804
I guess it's hard

12:01.887 --> 12:03.597
{\an3}to be honest with other
people if you can't

12:03.681 --> 12:06.267
be honest with yourself.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.026
You should go to her.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.112
Yeah.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.246
(sighs)

12:27.329 --> 12:29.540
(calliope music playing)

12:31.584 --> 12:33.502
Oh, yes!

12:33.586 --> 12:35.296
Whoo!

12:35.379 --> 12:37.131
{\an1}So you up
for a little more?

12:37.214 --> 12:38.507
{\an3}Yeah, I'm game
if you are.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.050
{\an3}You know, thanks for coming
with me tonight.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.260
It really meant a lot.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.636
Thanks for asking me.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.680
{\an1}I know it must have
been pretty hard to do.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.682
{\an3}You know, could you
just stop being perfect

12:46.765 --> 12:48.017
maybe for, like,
a minute there?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.019
Um, I could try.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.979
Nah, perfect
works for me.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.731
{\an1}So how about
the Ferris wheel?

12:53.814 --> 12:55.441
{\an5}Ferris wheel,
let's go!
Let's do it!

12:58.694 --> 13:00.488
{\an1}You know,
Donna and Cliff

13:00.571 --> 13:02.031
{\an1}are spending a lot
of time together, huh?

13:02.114 --> 13:03.866
Yeah, I like him.

13:03.949 --> 13:04.867
He's cool.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.869
{\an1}Yeah, but what
about David?

13:06.952 --> 13:08.871
What about David?

13:08.954 --> 13:10.706
{\an3}Donna can hang out
with Cliff if she wants.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.041
{\an3}David's with Chloe
all the time.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.876
{\an1}That's different,
Clare.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.669
{\an3}That is such a
double standard.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.004
What're you saying,

13:17.087 --> 13:18.714
{\an3}guys can do whatever
they want, girls can't?

13:18.797 --> 13:20.174
{\an1}Yeah. In case
you haven't heard,

13:20.257 --> 13:21.675
it's still the 20th century.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.677
{\an3}MAN: Muscle!
Thank you.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.721
Mm!

13:25.804 --> 13:27.473
(mechanical whirring)

13:28.474 --> 13:30.017
Nice try, honey.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.101
Here, honey.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.605
So were you scared?

13:34.688 --> 13:36.565
Not with you.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.567
Is this okay?

13:38.651 --> 13:41.570
Yeah. Don't you
want to kiss me?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.697
More than anything.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.742
Way to go, Clare.

13:46.825 --> 13:47.743
Mm-hmm.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.745
Oh, way to go, Ryan.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.413
{\an3}CLARE:
Aw, that's cute.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.414
{\an1}STEVE:
Cute? Nothing.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.874
That's the Sanders touch.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.918
Yeah, well, let's just hope
he keeps the Sanders touch

13:56.001 --> 13:57.419
{\an1}where she wants it to.
DONNA: Hey,

13:57.503 --> 13:58.921
{\an3}S and C, we're gonna
go get dinner.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.422
{\an5}You guys want
to come?
There's an
all-you-can-eat

14:00.506 --> 14:01.924
{\an5}special at
Hot Dog on a Stick.
Mmm.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.551
It's our favorite.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.094
Uh, we....

14:05.177 --> 14:06.428
{\an3}Yeah, no thanks, guys.
We gotta go.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.638
I think we'll pass.
DONNA: Oh, right,

14:07.721 --> 14:09.139
I get it. Bye-bye.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.599
See you later.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.725
Go, Ryan.
Bye, guys.

14:11.809 --> 14:12.601
Hey.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.105
Hey, uh, Steve, can
I, uh, talk to you

14:16.188 --> 14:17.439
for a sec?
Yeah, sure,

14:17.523 --> 14:18.357
{\an3}why don't we catch up to
you guys in a second?

14:18.440 --> 14:20.901
Okay, we'll meet you in the car.
Let's go.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.155
{\an1}Dude...

14:25.239 --> 14:27.575
she is fine.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.784
{\an3}Ah. Thanks.

14:28.867 --> 14:29.660
I think so, too.

14:29.743 --> 14:30.828
So what's the problem?

14:30.911 --> 14:32.663
You need some cash?

14:32.746 --> 14:35.082
Steve, got any condoms?

14:35.165 --> 14:37.084
(laughing):
Oh!

14:37.167 --> 14:39.086
You gotta be
kidding me?!

14:39.169 --> 14:41.005
{\an3}Oh, this is
a good day!

14:41.088 --> 14:42.631
This is a proud
moment for me!

14:42.715 --> 14:43.924
{\an1}Well, I need
to borrow a condom.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.926
Rule number 22.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.846
{\an3}You don't borrow condoms--
nobody wants it back.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.848
{\an1}Well, her parents
are going out of town,

14:50.931 --> 14:52.850
and she invited me
over to her house.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.311
That means we're going
to be completely alone.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.478
Ooh, tonight?

14:56.562 --> 14:57.646
Tomorrow.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.315
But I need to be ready.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.650
{\an3}Oh, very good,
grasshopper.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.947
{\an3}You know, Trace,
I don't know

15:07.031 --> 15:08.324
how we're supposed
to get through this

15:08.407 --> 15:09.491
if you won't talk to me.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.326
{\an1}Is that what
you want to do?

15:10.409 --> 15:11.493
Get through this?
How many more

15:11.577 --> 15:12.953
{\an3}times do I have
to tell you?

15:13.037 --> 15:14.288
I wasn't keeping the ring

15:14.371 --> 15:15.664
{\an3}because I'm waiting
for Kelly to come back.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.291
{\an1}Then why are you
keeping it?

15:17.374 --> 15:19.710
I don't know.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.462
You know, maybe you'd
better think about it

15:21.545 --> 15:22.838
for once in your life.

15:22.921 --> 15:24.006
What's that supposed to mean?

15:24.089 --> 15:25.174
{\an1}It means you
can't let somebody

15:25.257 --> 15:27.134
think you love them
if you don't.

15:27.217 --> 15:28.844
I know that.
But why can't you realize

15:28.927 --> 15:30.512
you're just upset
because you're embarrassed?

15:30.596 --> 15:32.640
I'm upset because
you're cheating on me!

15:32.723 --> 15:33.641
That's ridiculous.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.517
Just tell me if you love her.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.646
Trace....
It's a simple question.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.022
I wish I had a simple answer.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.024
(sighs)

15:42.107 --> 15:45.486
Well, at least you had
the decency not to lie to me.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.198
Good-bye, Brandon.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.868
Good-bye.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.246
(door slamming)

16:07.633 --> 16:10.052
(calliope music playing)

16:10.135 --> 16:11.220
So, you having fun?

16:11.303 --> 16:12.846
Do you need to ask?

16:12.930 --> 16:14.390
Okay, so I'm insecure.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.599
Don't be.

16:15.683 --> 16:16.892
I had fun tonight.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.769
Good.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.688
Then let's have some more.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.408
It's David, isn't it?

16:32.491 --> 16:35.411
We just... we go back so far,

16:35.494 --> 16:37.037
I don't want to hurt him.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.455
So you can hurt me?
No,

16:38.539 --> 16:39.915
of course not. I...

16:39.998 --> 16:41.417
I don't want to hurt anybody.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.085
I just don't know

16:43.168 --> 16:44.753
if I should be playing around
with you.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.256
This isn't a game to me, Donna.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.341
I'm not playing around.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.519
(playing gentle tune)

17:02.354 --> 17:04.189
Did you talk to her?

17:04.272 --> 17:06.150
No.

17:06.233 --> 17:09.278
{\an1}No, she must still be out
with fireman Cliff.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.196
(sighs)

17:12.281 --> 17:13.615
You know, it's amazing

17:13.699 --> 17:15.992
how you can know
someone so little

17:16.076 --> 17:17.994
and hate him so much.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.164
{\an3}Well, I don't see
what she sees in him.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.290
I mean, he certainly
doesn't do it for me.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.171
{\an1}That's pretty.
Is it new?

17:27.253 --> 17:30.174
{\an3}Just something
I'm playing with.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.301
{\an3}I think it's gonna
be a love song.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.264
It's not sad enough.

17:42.227 --> 17:45.147
{\an3}This is really getting
to you, isn't it?

17:45.230 --> 17:46.982
I just don't get it.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.651
{\an1}I mean, it's not like I did
anything to make her mad,

17:49.735 --> 17:51.695
but he...

17:51.779 --> 17:54.323
he comes into town,
and she's all over him.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.159
David, if Donna's
cheating on you,

17:57.242 --> 17:58.535
maybe you should
just forget her.

17:58.619 --> 17:59.995
No, it's not like that.

18:00.078 --> 18:01.997
She's not sleeping with him,
believe me.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.248
{\an3}Why?

18:03.332 --> 18:05.000
Because she told you?

18:05.083 --> 18:07.127
No.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.465
She's a virgin.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.509
{\an1}You're kidding me.
No.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.344
It's pretty important to her.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.055
How do you feel about it?

18:18.138 --> 18:20.766
I love her.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.768
I respect her wishes.

18:22.851 --> 18:26.188
Like she respects you
by going out with Cliff?

18:26.271 --> 18:28.065
Come on, that's not fair.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.858
{\an3}Maybe not.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.985
But it's true.

18:48.126 --> 18:49.878
Having a bad dream, honey?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.213
Yes, Daddy.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.173
Do you want me to tell you
a story?

18:53.257 --> 18:55.217
Yes, Daddy.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.220
Once upon a time
there was a little girl

18:58.303 --> 19:00.931
who loved her daddy so much,

19:01.014 --> 19:06.144
she made her daddy do all kinds
of terrible things.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.908
Where are you going?

19:19.992 --> 19:22.035
I gotta deal with this.

19:30.168 --> 19:32.212
(knocking on door)

19:43.015 --> 19:44.933
I gotta talk to you.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.019
{\an3}Come in.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.816
You won't speak to me,

19:52.900 --> 19:55.819
{\an1}now it has to be
in the middle of the night?

19:55.903 --> 19:57.905
Well, you were always
such a sound sleeper.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.948
What do you mean?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.950
You must have been,

20:02.034 --> 20:04.244
{\an3}to be able to sleep
through the night

20:04.328 --> 20:06.079
while your husband was coming
into my room.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.289
What are you talking about?

20:07.372 --> 20:09.917
I'm talking about rape, Mother.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.793
Incest. Child abuse.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.837
{\an3}Our family, your husband,
your daughter.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.172
Does that ring any bells?

20:15.255 --> 20:18.300
{\an1}You're accusing
your father of...

20:20.928 --> 20:22.930
How dare you!
That's right.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.848
Defend him in the grave.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.142
{\an3}It's not like you have
to care about me at all.

20:27.225 --> 20:29.353
{\an3}I was married to him
for 20 years!

20:29.436 --> 20:30.646
I think I knew him
better than anyone.

20:30.729 --> 20:31.772
I guess you didn't know him

20:31.855 --> 20:32.773
as well as you thought.

20:32.856 --> 20:33.982
Your father had his faults,

20:34.066 --> 20:36.276
but he was a good man.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.819
Victor Malone was a vicious
son of a bitch,

20:37.903 --> 20:39.947
and if you didn't know it,
you were blind.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.114
You were always wild.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.699
Always in trouble.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.701
You know what?

20:44.785 --> 20:47.663
As much as I hated him,

20:47.746 --> 20:49.665
you were worse than he was.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.166
{\an1}You could have
stopped it.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.334
{\an1}You could have
stopped him

20:52.417 --> 20:53.335
coming into my room....

20:53.418 --> 20:54.336
(gasps)

20:54.419 --> 20:57.214
Go to hell!

20:57.297 --> 20:59.800
(gasps)

21:01.635 --> 21:04.805
I, I've been in hell.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.934
Since I was 11 years old.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.191
(door slamming)

21:31.665 --> 21:34.584
{\an5}KELLY:
<i>You always hear this stuff</i>
<i>about fate.</i>

21:34.668 --> 21:36.586
<i>Destiny.</i>

21:36.670 --> 21:39.756
<i>But what if you only get</i>
<i>a certain number of chances</i>

21:39.840 --> 21:45.387
<i>for fate to take its course?</i>

21:45.470 --> 21:47.389
<i>I mean,</i>

21:47.472 --> 21:50.392
<i>if Brandon and I are meant</i>
<i>to be together,</i>

21:50.475 --> 21:53.478
<i>why aren't we together?</i>

21:54.855 --> 21:57.149
Here you go.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.360
Hmm.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.070
{\an1}Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.905
How was your date?

22:03.989 --> 22:05.907
The date? Oh.

22:05.991 --> 22:09.119
The date was terrific,
the date was awful.

22:09.202 --> 22:10.412
{\an3}It was a little bit
of everything.

22:10.495 --> 22:11.830
I think you need to elaborate.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.290
Yeah. Uh...

22:13.373 --> 22:15.292
I don't know, it just...

22:15.375 --> 22:17.294
seems so easy with Cliff.

22:17.377 --> 22:18.920
And with David,

22:19.004 --> 22:20.589
everything's just
always difficult.

22:20.672 --> 22:21.590
Hmm.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.759
Do you still love David?

22:23.842 --> 22:25.719
Yeah.

22:25.802 --> 22:28.555
{\an3}But if I do, why do I have
all these feelings for Cliff?

22:28.638 --> 22:30.557
{\an6}(chuckling):
And I do have all these
feelings for Cliff.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.558
{\an1}(chuckles)

22:31.641 --> 22:32.934
{\an1}Well,
aside from the fact

22:33.018 --> 22:37.147
{\an1}that he's gorgeous,
maybe you're just mad at David

22:37.230 --> 22:38.815
{\an1}because he wasn't there
for you.

22:38.899 --> 22:39.941
Hmm.

22:40.025 --> 22:40.901
Go on, Dr. Taylor.

22:40.984 --> 22:44.821
{\an1}No, this is very familiar
territory for me.

22:44.905 --> 22:47.282
It's the Emily Valentine
syndrome.

22:47.365 --> 22:50.786
Brandon was with her
the night I was in the fire.

22:50.869 --> 22:51.953
That's right.

22:52.037 --> 22:55.248
Just like David was with Chloe
when I was taken hostage.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.292
Exactly.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.002
Have you forgiven him for that?

22:59.086 --> 23:01.546
I don't know.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.048
Well, did you talk
to him last night?

23:03.131 --> 23:04.841
'Cause he doesn't look
very happy.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.844
Yeah, I know.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.513
I've been thinking
about him a lot.

23:09.596 --> 23:12.599
Thinking that maybe you want
to get back together with him?

23:12.682 --> 23:15.519
It doesn't matter what I think.

23:15.602 --> 23:17.479
I'm not going to do anything
about it.

23:17.562 --> 23:18.563
Well, that's stupid.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.815
If you still love him,

23:19.898 --> 23:21.483
you have to tell him.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.318
I have told him.

23:23.401 --> 23:26.321
After Colin, after Susan.

23:26.404 --> 23:28.448
He knows how I feel.

23:28.532 --> 23:32.661
If he wants to do anything
about it... he will.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.872
Well, I still think
you should talk to him.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.958
Like you're going
to talk to David?

23:39.960 --> 23:42.295
Hmm.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.339
(tapping)

23:45.715 --> 23:47.551
What?

23:47.634 --> 23:48.635
{\an3}What's the
matter, Clare?

23:48.718 --> 23:50.220
{\an3}Talk to me, you're
killing me here.

23:50.303 --> 23:51.513
{\an1}Do you know
what the expression

23:51.596 --> 23:54.558
{\an1}"in loco parentis"
means?

23:54.641 --> 23:55.851
Isn't that from
the Kama Sutra?

23:55.934 --> 23:56.852
(sighs)

23:56.935 --> 23:58.353
{\an1}No, it means
if you're going

23:58.436 --> 24:00.355
to be responsible
as Ryan's parent,

24:00.438 --> 24:01.690
{\an1}you have to deal
with this situation.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.316
{\an3}Okay?
What situation?

24:03.400 --> 24:04.359
He's going to have sex.

24:04.442 --> 24:05.235
It's a good thing.

24:05.318 --> 24:07.320
{\an1}You don't just hand a condom
to a teenager

24:07.404 --> 24:08.196
and say, "Go out and play."

24:08.280 --> 24:11.449
Since when did you become
Dr. Ruth?

24:11.533 --> 24:13.243
I seem to recall
when you were a teenager,

24:13.326 --> 24:14.327
you... you handcuffed yourself

24:14.411 --> 24:15.871
to Brandon's bed.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.205
{\an1}Am I right?
Well, obviously,

24:17.289 --> 24:19.249
I needed advice back then.

24:19.332 --> 24:21.376
I know what you needed.

24:21.459 --> 24:24.045
Ah, good morning.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.047
{\an3}CLARE:
Morning.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.884
So... tonight's
the big night, huh?

24:28.967 --> 24:31.219
Oh, God.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.220
You told her?

24:32.304 --> 24:33.889
{\an1}Ryan, um,

24:33.972 --> 24:35.140
how much do you know about sex?

24:35.223 --> 24:38.393
And I don't mean from
<i>Penthouse Forum,</i> 'cause...

24:38.476 --> 24:39.895
{\an1}most women don't really
throw themselves

24:39.978 --> 24:42.397
on strange men
in the hot, steamy laundry room.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.232
Isn't that a shame?
I am so embarrassed.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.775
{\an3}STEVE:
Yeah, join the club.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.569
{\an3}Clare, I told you
I'd talk to Ry

24:47.652 --> 24:49.196
after breakfast.

24:49.279 --> 24:50.614
Okay.

24:50.697 --> 24:51.740
Let's eat.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.463
{\an1}You look like you had
a rugged night.

25:06.546 --> 25:08.381
Yeah, I didn't
get much sleep.

25:10.467 --> 25:12.385
(sighs)

25:12.469 --> 25:16.056
Last night, I, uh...

25:16.139 --> 25:19.309
I lost something important to me

25:19.392 --> 25:21.102
because I couldn't let go
of the past.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.437
You mean Kelly.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.732
(sighs)

25:25.815 --> 25:27.234
She still cares for you.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.319
Nat, I asked the woman
to marry me.

25:29.402 --> 25:30.904
She knows how I feel.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.739
If she wanted things to be
different, she'd say something.

25:32.822 --> 25:34.449
{\an3}What are you going to do?
Something

25:34.532 --> 25:35.617
I should have done
a long time ago.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.077
Talk to Kel?

25:37.160 --> 25:38.078
{\an3}No.

25:38.161 --> 25:40.330
Return the ring.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.626
(sighs)

25:44.709 --> 25:47.128
(door opens, then closes)

25:47.212 --> 25:48.713
Hi, Tom.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.425
Mrs. Malone.

25:52.509 --> 25:53.301
Valerie's around here somewhere.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.386
{\an1}I'll go get her.
Actually,

25:54.469 --> 25:56.471
I wanted to talk to you
for a minute. Is that okay?

25:56.554 --> 25:58.431
Sure.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.312
{\an1}Can I get you some coffee
or anything?

26:04.396 --> 26:06.815
No, thank you.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.652
{\an3}I need your help
with Valerie.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.320
{\an3}I, uh...

26:12.404 --> 26:15.031
She...

26:17.242 --> 26:19.286
You know what?

26:19.369 --> 26:20.829
{\an3}Never mind.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.289
I can't do this.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.165
I'm sorry
to have wasted your time.

26:25.208 --> 26:28.169
{\an1}I know.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.672
{\an1}If it makes it
any easier for you,

26:30.755 --> 26:33.091
{\an1}I knew
what was happening.

26:43.226 --> 26:46.313
(sighs)

26:46.396 --> 26:48.565
{\an1}I still
can't believe it,

26:48.648 --> 26:50.525
but I guess I have to.

26:50.608 --> 26:51.735
Yeah, you do.

26:51.818 --> 26:52.944
At least now I know

26:53.028 --> 26:54.863
{\an1}why she hated me
all this time.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.282
{\an1}But you have
to believe me.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.827
{\an1}I didn't know
what was happening.

27:00.910 --> 27:04.080
I swear to God
I didn't know.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.373
{\an1}But you did?
Yeah,

27:05.457 --> 27:07.375
Valerie told me
what was going on.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.127
Why didn't she tell me?

27:09.210 --> 27:11.296
Well, maybe I was afraid

27:11.379 --> 27:14.215
I'd get the same reception
as I got last night, Mother.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.383
{\an1}Valerie.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.594
Or that I thought
it was my own fault.

27:17.677 --> 27:19.888
How can you say that?

27:19.971 --> 27:21.431
{\an3}You know, when it
happened the first time,

27:21.514 --> 27:25.185
{\an3}I was so scared that I, I
didn't tell anybody about it.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.395
{\an3}And then I didn't
tell anybody about it

27:27.479 --> 27:29.647
{\an3}and it happened again and I
thought I'd get into trouble.

27:29.731 --> 27:33.276
Besides, he told me
you said I had to.

27:34.277 --> 27:38.406
{\an1}Tom... would you
leave us alone, please?

27:38.490 --> 27:39.282
{\an3}No.

27:39.366 --> 27:40.992
He was there for me
when I needed him,

27:41.076 --> 27:42.535
and I need him now.
What do you mean

27:42.619 --> 27:43.912
he was there for you?

27:43.995 --> 27:46.039
{\an1}When Valerie told me
what was going on,

27:46.122 --> 27:49.417
{\an3}I wanted to kill
the son of a bitch,

27:49.501 --> 27:52.295
{\an3}but I didn't...
on one condition.

27:52.379 --> 27:55.131
Tom said if I didn't go to
the police, that he would.

27:55.215 --> 27:56.257
But you didn't.

27:56.341 --> 27:59.094
I told Daddy.

27:59.177 --> 28:00.595
I said if he didn't leave

28:00.678 --> 28:02.263
or if he didn't
get some help,

28:02.347 --> 28:05.975
that I was going to go
to the police.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.435
He shot himself that night.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.437
Oh, my God.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.106
{\an3}And that's not all
I feel guilty about.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.899
I'm glad he did it.

28:12.982 --> 28:14.984
{\an3}That's what I
feel guilty about.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.864
I'm glad the bastard's dead.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.576
(sobbing)

28:38.925 --> 28:42.262
(doorbell chimes)

28:46.891 --> 28:48.643
Hi.

28:48.726 --> 28:50.812
Uh, I,
I wasn't expecting anyone.

28:50.895 --> 28:51.938
I'm sorry.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.148
{\an3}I should have called.
No,

28:53.231 --> 28:54.482
no, that's okay.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.567
Come on in.

29:00.905 --> 29:04.784
{\an1}Look, Tracy, if this is
about last night...

29:04.868 --> 29:08.037
{\an3}Brandon and I
broke up last night.

29:08.121 --> 29:10.331
Wow.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.332
I'm sorry.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.542
Are you?

29:12.625 --> 29:14.752
Yes.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.504
I'm sorry.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.965
I didn't mean it to s-- I...

29:20.967 --> 29:22.343
Do you know why we broke up?

29:22.427 --> 29:25.180
No, I don't.

29:26.222 --> 29:28.391
I found your engagement ring.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.852
He never got rid of it.

29:30.935 --> 29:33.188
Did you know
that he still had it?

29:33.271 --> 29:35.190
(sighs)

29:35.273 --> 29:39.861
Uh... no, I-I didn't know that.

29:39.944 --> 29:42.530
(sighs)

29:42.614 --> 29:43.907
This is so hard.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.205
(sighs)

29:50.288 --> 29:51.873
Tracy, I'm really sorry.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.585
Yeah, that's just what he said.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.550
Look, Kelly, I came here
to do the noble thing--

30:02.634 --> 30:05.220
{\an3}to tell you that I'd
bow out gracefully

30:05.303 --> 30:08.765
{\an3}and let the royal couple
assume their rightful place--

30:08.848 --> 30:11.559
but I can't do it.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.856
You love him, don't you?

30:16.940 --> 30:18.441
Do you?

30:19.442 --> 30:21.986
Yes.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.448
So do I.

30:27.116 --> 30:28.076
This isn't fair.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.410
You know, you turned him down.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.537
You broke up with him.

30:31.538 --> 30:33.581
{\an3}But you never
let him go.

30:33.665 --> 30:38.294
Love is supposed
to make people happy, Kelly.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.712
Are you happy?

30:41.047 --> 30:42.966
Brandon and I could
be happy together.

30:43.049 --> 30:45.093
I know we could.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.180
But you have
to make up your mind.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.392
Once and for all.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.703
(sighs)

31:19.043 --> 31:20.962
Okay.

31:21.045 --> 31:23.506
(clears throat)

31:23.590 --> 31:27.135
{\an1}Ryan, I've been meaning
to talk to you about, uh...

31:27.218 --> 31:29.095
{\an1}Sex with Katie?
Sex.

31:29.178 --> 31:31.139
{\an1}Katie sex.

31:31.222 --> 31:32.640
{\an1}And, um...

31:34.601 --> 31:37.145
It's like this.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.646
You got the egg...

31:38.730 --> 31:39.647
Steve, Steve.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.274
I already know that part.

31:41.357 --> 31:42.775
{\an3}Good.
Look, what I don't know

31:42.859 --> 31:44.819
is why I'm so nervous.

31:44.902 --> 31:46.154
Well, how do you feel about her?

31:46.237 --> 31:47.155
Do you love her?

31:47.238 --> 31:48.656
I don't know.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.492
I mean, I like her, but we've
only been out one time.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.202
Hmm.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.871
Well, uh,

31:54.954 --> 31:58.374
maybe you owe it
to her to, uh...

31:58.458 --> 31:59.626
Wait?

31:59.709 --> 32:02.920
Wait. Wait?

32:03.004 --> 32:03.880
Yeah.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.006
You mean that's okay?

32:05.089 --> 32:07.133
All the guys I know
are always in this big hurry.

32:07.216 --> 32:09.218
(doorbell chimes)
(laughs)

32:09.302 --> 32:11.054
Do you, uh, want me to get that?

32:12.096 --> 32:15.558
No. I think we're done.

32:15.642 --> 32:16.851
Yeah, wait.

32:16.934 --> 32:20.563
Uh, thanks a lot, Steve.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.523
Oh, hey, Kel.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.484
Hey, is Brandon here?

32:24.567 --> 32:26.069
{\an1}No, but he'll be
back later.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.362
{\an3}Do you know
where he went?

32:27.445 --> 32:29.906
Yeah, but I really can't say.

32:29.989 --> 32:32.700
Look, Steve,
I know about the ring.

32:32.784 --> 32:33.701
Tracy told me.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.703
Yeah, Brandon told me, too.

32:35.787 --> 32:39.874
So, if you know where he is,
I could really use your help.

32:39.957 --> 32:43.670
Well, he, uh,
he went to return it.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.046
Do you know where?

32:45.129 --> 32:46.047
{\an1}Westwood,

32:46.130 --> 32:47.715
some German jewelry store.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.426
Yeah, I'll find it, thanks.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.887
You'd better hurry.

32:52.970 --> 32:54.722
DAVID:
<i>You did what?</i>

32:54.806 --> 32:57.475
{\an1}Martin Burns,
Luther Vandross's manager?

32:57.558 --> 32:59.310
I sent him a copy
of my demo tape,

32:59.394 --> 33:00.728
{\an1}and, uh, he wants us
to go to New York.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.690
No, no, I can't
go to New York.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.400
Oh, that's right.

33:05.483 --> 33:08.403
You have to stay here so that
Donna can make a fool of you.

33:08.486 --> 33:09.529
{\an3}I thought we agreed
to take it slow.

33:09.612 --> 33:10.780
Why didn't you wait?

33:11.823 --> 33:13.783
Look, David,

33:13.866 --> 33:15.827
I'm tired of taking things slow.

33:15.910 --> 33:18.371
Come on. We're a team.

33:18.454 --> 33:21.374
We could be big.

33:21.457 --> 33:23.209
Stop, all right?

33:23.292 --> 33:25.461
What's the big deal?

33:25.545 --> 33:28.423
{\an1}She can't give you
what you want, and I can.

33:28.506 --> 33:31.259
{\an3}I don't think you know the
first thing about what I want.

33:31.342 --> 33:35.722
Okay.

33:35.805 --> 33:38.558
{\an1}Fine. I guess I'll just go
to New York by myself.

33:38.641 --> 33:41.519
Yeah, you do that.

33:41.602 --> 33:43.271
{\an3}Just get dressed
and go, all right?

33:43.354 --> 33:44.939
If that's what you want.

33:45.022 --> 33:46.107
(knocking)

33:46.190 --> 33:47.442
{\an3}DONNA:
David, are you home?

33:47.525 --> 33:48.401
{\an1}Oops.

33:48.484 --> 33:50.778
Go in the bedroom, please.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.781
Why, did you change your mind?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.450
{\an3}Just do it.

34:00.371 --> 34:01.456
(sighs)

34:01.539 --> 34:03.124
{\an3}Hey.
Hi.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.126
Um, I just came to say

34:05.209 --> 34:07.295
that I think we should
talk about everything.

34:07.378 --> 34:10.005
{\an3}Yeah. Yeah, I think
we should, too.

34:10.089 --> 34:11.674
Okay. Um, can I come in?

34:11.757 --> 34:13.092
{\an3}CHLOE:
David?

34:13.176 --> 34:14.802
She's here?

34:14.886 --> 34:16.387
Well, we-we were working.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.473
Oh.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.308
{\an3}Hi, Donna.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.851
(sighs)

34:21.934 --> 34:23.603
I knew this was a mistake.

34:23.686 --> 34:24.645
{\an4}Donna, wait.
DONNA:
No.

34:24.728 --> 34:26.813
David, forget it.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.878
Valerie, come in.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.420
I was just packing.

35:03.726 --> 35:05.269
Listen, Mother, uh...

35:05.353 --> 35:06.979
(sighs)

35:07.063 --> 35:08.397
{\an3}...I've changed
my mind, huh?

35:08.481 --> 35:09.357
I'll sign the papers.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.442
Why?

35:13.402 --> 35:14.612
He's dead. I...

35:14.695 --> 35:16.864
{\an3}I should let the
past die with him.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.367
Yeah, we all should.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.702
I'm gonna sell the house.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.830
{\an1}I could never
live there.

35:25.623 --> 35:27.542
{\an3}(voice breaking):
I'm glad.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.752
(sighs)

35:31.420 --> 35:33.756
Listen, there's something else
I need to tell you.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.216
Oh, God, Valerie.

35:35.299 --> 35:37.718
(sniffles) I don't know
if I can take any more.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.804
I believe you.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.182
I believe that you didn't know.

35:44.475 --> 35:46.519
But I should have.

35:46.602 --> 35:48.896
(sighs)

35:48.980 --> 35:51.148
{\an1}(crying)

35:54.819 --> 35:56.237
Oh.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.906
I'll never forgive myself
for what happened to you.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.200
(sighs)

36:01.284 --> 36:03.286
{\an1}(crying)

36:04.662 --> 36:06.414
Neither will I.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.499
{\an3}(crying)

36:23.723 --> 36:25.433
FREUDENBERG:
Back again?

36:25.516 --> 36:27.101
Pardon me?

36:27.184 --> 36:28.436
I don't forget.

36:28.519 --> 36:31.898
A couple of years ago,
you came in here.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.274
You bought a ring.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.484
Then last year,
you came in again.

36:35.568 --> 36:36.944
{\an1}You wanted
to return it.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.446
That's right.

36:38.529 --> 36:39.906
How'd you remember that?

36:39.989 --> 36:41.991
That is my business.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.119
You couldn't return the ring,

36:45.202 --> 36:47.455
because you still
loved the girl.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.250
{\an1}I think I'm ready
now, sir.

36:51.334 --> 36:53.294
{\an3}Okay.

36:53.377 --> 36:56.088
Do you want cash, or

36:56.172 --> 36:58.174
maybe an exchange?

36:59.717 --> 37:01.302
Take a look in the case.

37:01.385 --> 37:04.013
Maybe for the other girl.

37:04.096 --> 37:06.098
{\an1}I don't think
there is another girl.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.142
Don't tell me
my business.

37:08.225 --> 37:09.268
In love, not in love.

37:09.352 --> 37:10.519
Halfway between the two.

37:10.603 --> 37:11.771
I've seen it before.

37:11.854 --> 37:12.939
How do you know so much?

37:13.022 --> 37:14.148
It is not magic.

37:14.231 --> 37:16.817
{\an3}35 years of
making love

37:16.901 --> 37:19.946
into metal, you get a feeling
for such things.

37:20.029 --> 37:21.697
Hmm?

37:23.074 --> 37:24.992
{\an3}Do you see
something you like?

37:25.076 --> 37:26.160
Yeah. Yeah.

37:26.243 --> 37:28.329
{\an1}The, uh...

37:28.412 --> 37:30.164
The bracelet.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.250
Yes, the bracelet is lovely.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.301
{\an3}So,

37:42.385 --> 37:45.888
are you ready to exchange
your past for your future?

38:04.782 --> 38:05.950
No.

38:07.952 --> 38:10.121
I can't do it

38:10.204 --> 38:12.206
until I know
it's really over between us.

38:12.289 --> 38:14.917
Okay.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.877
Then I will hold on to this

38:16.961 --> 38:18.879
for you until you
make up your mind.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.131
Thanks.

38:20.214 --> 38:21.257
{\an3}She must be

38:21.340 --> 38:24.677
some girl,
this one in your past.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.930
You do know your business,
Mr. Freudenberg.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.897
What a strange young man.

38:38.941 --> 38:41.318
(sighs)

38:41.402 --> 38:43.404
{\an3}Kelly?

38:45.322 --> 38:46.741
{\an1}(sighs)

38:46.824 --> 38:48.909
{\an1}Brandon.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.911
What are you
doing here?

38:50.995 --> 38:53.539
I, uh...

38:55.624 --> 38:57.543
Tracy told me about the ring.

38:57.626 --> 38:59.211
Really?

38:59.295 --> 39:00.880
Yeah.

39:00.963 --> 39:02.798
She shouldn't have done that.

39:02.882 --> 39:06.302
Maybe not, but she did.

39:06.385 --> 39:08.554
What are you doing here?

39:08.637 --> 39:10.598
I, uh...

39:12.016 --> 39:13.934
I came to return the ring.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.270
Good.

39:16.353 --> 39:17.938
{\an1}Good?
Good

39:18.022 --> 39:20.941
that, that you, uh, returned it.

39:21.025 --> 39:21.859
Good.

39:21.942 --> 39:24.320
That's what I came
to talk to you about.

39:24.403 --> 39:27.114
You came to talk to me
about returning the ring?

39:27.198 --> 39:30.576
Yeah, if that's what you want
to do, you-you should.

39:32.495 --> 39:33.621
(laughs)

39:33.704 --> 39:34.914
We shouldn't...

39:34.997 --> 39:35.790
We can't.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.917
Not anymore.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.961
It's just too much.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.630
Yeah.

39:42.713 --> 39:45.299
Yeah, it's, uh...

39:45.382 --> 39:47.510
It's too much.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.685
{\an3}VALERIE:
Hey.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.773
{\an1}You okay?

40:02.733 --> 40:04.652
{\an3}Much better
than I thought.

40:04.735 --> 40:05.778
{\an3}(sighs)

40:05.861 --> 40:07.363
So, where's Abby?

40:07.446 --> 40:10.491
I thought we could have, uh,
dinner together or something.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.703
She's on her way
to the airport.

40:14.787 --> 40:16.831
{\an1}Oh.

40:18.707 --> 40:19.959
Valerie, um...

40:20.042 --> 40:21.335
No, I just....

40:21.418 --> 40:24.505
{\an3}I just need that part of
my life done and over with.

40:24.588 --> 40:27.091
{\an3}I never want to think
about it again.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.970
Does that mean me, too?

40:31.929 --> 40:34.306
I love you so much.

40:34.390 --> 40:36.183
I've always loved you.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.685
You know that.

40:37.768 --> 40:40.020
It's just, every time
I look in your eyes,

40:40.104 --> 40:41.564
I can't help
but see him

40:41.647 --> 40:44.692
coming into my bedroom and...

40:44.775 --> 40:48.529
feeling him touching me...

40:48.612 --> 40:50.531
seeing him dead
on the bathroom floor.

40:50.614 --> 40:52.867
Tom, it's just all
mixed up, you know.

40:52.950 --> 40:56.537
Me, you, my mother, him.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.792
It's just too much.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.837
Um...

41:06.630 --> 41:09.466
Maybe you need some time to...

41:09.550 --> 41:11.552
sort it all out.

41:13.637 --> 41:15.222
I don't know what I need.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.224
I just...

41:17.308 --> 41:19.351
I know this isn't the time.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.228
Yeah, well, I'm not used

41:21.312 --> 41:23.689
to staying this long
in one place, anyway, so...

41:23.772 --> 41:26.275
It's for the best.

41:26.358 --> 41:29.403
For now, and
then, may...

41:29.486 --> 41:30.738
maybe later...

41:30.821 --> 41:32.531
I don't know.

41:35.701 --> 41:38.454
Well, I'm glad
you, uh, worked things out.

41:38.537 --> 41:40.581
I couldn't have done it
without you.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.625
Well, at least I'm good
for something, right?

41:44.335 --> 41:46.420
(sighs)

41:46.503 --> 41:48.923
How about a drink for the road?

41:51.467 --> 41:53.469
Sounds good.

41:55.179 --> 41:57.264
(sniffles)

42:09.068 --> 42:11.278
(knock on door)

42:14.031 --> 42:15.407
You told Kelly.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.617
(sighs)

42:16.700 --> 42:18.410
I'm sorry. I had to.

42:18.494 --> 42:19.912
Not as sorry as I am.

42:22.539 --> 42:24.458
I returned the ring.

42:25.501 --> 42:27.461
You did?

42:27.544 --> 42:29.004
Yeah.

42:29.088 --> 42:31.465
{\an3}I saw this.

42:31.548 --> 42:33.217
{\an3}Thought you
might like it.

42:33.300 --> 42:34.426
What is it?

42:34.510 --> 42:35.636
{\an3}Open it.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.513
(paper tearing)

42:41.934 --> 42:44.061
Oh.

42:56.782 --> 42:58.909
(seagulls calling)

43:01.203 --> 43:03.622
KELLY:
<i>I bought a gift today</i>

43:03.706 --> 43:05.624
<i>for someone I love.</i>

43:05.708 --> 43:07.668
<i>Maybe I paid too much</i>

43:07.751 --> 43:11.338
<i>for something</i>
<i>no one will ever see, but</i>

43:11.422 --> 43:12.131
<i>I didn't want anyone else</i>
<i>to have it.</i>
