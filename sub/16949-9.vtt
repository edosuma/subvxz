Previously on "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:
Hollywood"...

00:05.505 --> 00:07.741
{\an7}You are cordially invited
to attend a listening party

00:07.807 --> 00:09.976
{\an7}for Moniece Slaughter's
new album.

00:10.043 --> 00:11.077
{\an8}That's a joke.

00:11.144 --> 00:13.446
{\an7}So we're gonna
accept the joke and go.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.281
{\an8}I, for one, think
this is a terrible idea.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.317
{\an9}And I'm in.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.317
{\an7}Yes!

00:17.384 --> 00:19.486
{\an8}Brandi, Becky found me,

00:19.552 --> 00:21.154
{\an8}and she was not
serving me lemonade.

00:21.221 --> 00:23.356
{\an8}She was serving me
piping hot tea.

00:23.423 --> 00:24.424
{\an8}You're a mother(bleep) joke.

00:24.491 --> 00:26.993
{\an8}(crowd shrieking)

00:27.060 --> 00:28.328
{\an8}(A1)
It ain't about our parents.

00:28.395 --> 00:29.929
{\an8}It's about me and you.

00:29.996 --> 00:32.999
{\an7}This is not just
a housewarming party.

00:33.066 --> 00:35.735
{\an8}This is our wedding reception.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.806
{\an8}I don't believe that
she did this willingly.

00:39.873 --> 00:44.711
{\an8}It was a mutual agreement.

00:39.873 --> 00:44.711
{\an8}Initiated by you.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.380
{\an7}He decided to pretty much
deny that this is his child.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.082
{\an7}Do you want to go through
the court process?

00:49.149 --> 00:50.417
{\an8}Do I want to? No.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.152
{\an8}Do I feel like my hand
is being forced? Yes.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.454
{\an8}I want to be the one,
when she gets older,

00:54.521 --> 00:56.489
{\an8}"That's my daddy," yes.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.490
{\an7}He's starting
to look like a deadbeat

00:57.557 --> 00:59.492
{\an8}before the baby's even here.

01:01.761 --> 01:03.062
{\an8}I want the both of y'all.

01:05.031 --> 01:06.733
{\an8}Awkward.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.334
{\an7}I guess you my upgrade,
or my replacement?

01:08.401 --> 01:09.803
{\an8}She doesn't lie, though.

01:09.869 --> 01:10.937
{\an8}Rosa, me and you
(bleep) around.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.672
{\an7}You know what type
of bitch I am.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.607
{\an8}(Nikki)
One of my friends
wanted to meet you again.

01:16.209 --> 01:17.677
{\an8}Do you know my girl
over here?

01:17.744 --> 01:19.479
{\an8}Who the hell is this?

01:19.546 --> 01:21.281
{\an8}Nikki, God bless you.

01:21.347 --> 01:22.782
{\an8}God bless me, thank you.

01:21.347 --> 01:22.782
{\an8}You playing games.

01:22.849 --> 01:23.783
{\an8}I'm not playing games,
honey.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.118
{\an8}You two have fun.

{\an5}(Shanda)
It's been about a week
since Willie moved out,

02:02.922 --> 02:05.058
and we've been living apart,
and it's given me some time

02:05.124 --> 02:07.260
{\an8}to sit back
and process everything.

02:07.327 --> 02:09.529
{\an8}And I ain't gonna lie.
This really stressing me out.

02:09.596 --> 02:12.098
So I wanted to work it all out
with Nikki,

02:12.165 --> 02:13.500
and she chose yoga.

02:13.566 --> 02:16.769
{\an1}Whose idea was it to do this
bull(bleep)-ass yoga?

02:16.836 --> 02:18.671
Your ass. I could do
cycling or some (bleep).

02:18.738 --> 02:21.708
{\an4}I was trying to do
a little leg stand,
and then he almost fell.

02:21.774 --> 02:25.144
{\an1}That was a scam!
Ha ha!

02:25.211 --> 02:26.346
{\an1}Uh, hello.

02:26.412 --> 02:28.147
{\an1}What's up with you
not laughing at me today?

02:28.214 --> 02:29.849
I've just been
going through so much,

02:29.916 --> 02:31.017
Nikki, you have no idea.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.019
What's going on?

02:33.086 --> 02:37.423
{\an1}Well, um, my husband told me
that he screwed that bird.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.993
{\an1}He-- You are lying to me.
He admitted that he (bleep) her?

02:40.059 --> 02:42.395
{\an6}Yes.

02:40.059 --> 02:42.395
Oh, my God, girl.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.230
So we've been staying
in two different places.

02:44.297 --> 02:47.066
We have the kids
here with me sometimes,

02:47.133 --> 02:48.468
and then we'll
take 'em over there.

02:48.535 --> 02:49.869
What are you telling them
is going on?

02:49.936 --> 02:51.871
I'm just trying
to cover it up for them

02:51.938 --> 02:54.440
so that I won't hurt them
before I make the decision.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.377
{\an1}You would never keep
your kids from their dad.

02:57.443 --> 02:59.445
Ever! I'm not
that type of woman.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.848
{\an5}You can see your daddy
as much as you want to,
please.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.449
(Shanda)
With Willie and I living apart,

03:03.516 --> 03:04.984
it really doesn't
solve anything,

03:05.051 --> 03:06.853
so now I really gotta sit
and think about

03:06.920 --> 03:08.388
what I'm gonna do
with my marriage.

03:08.454 --> 03:11.024
The worst part is trying
to hide this from the kids.

03:11.090 --> 03:13.927
While Willie is far away
from being a model husband,

03:13.993 --> 03:15.762
he's always been a great dad.

03:15.828 --> 03:18.064
{\an1}I really hope
that y'all work it out.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.198
{\an1}You've been together
for so long

03:19.265 --> 03:20.800
{\an1}and you have the kids
and everything.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.268
It's so much
I would throw away.

03:22.335 --> 03:25.438
{\an1}I've been with him since
I was 17 years old. I'm 31.

03:25.505 --> 03:27.607
{\an5}A lot of bull(bleep),
but it wasn't always
bull(bleep).

03:27.674 --> 03:28.675
We had great times.

03:28.741 --> 03:30.043
{\an1}I'm not gonna tell you
it's easy.

03:30.109 --> 03:32.178
{\an4}I'm not married,
and I don't have kids.

03:30.109 --> 03:32.178
{\an3}Good.

03:32.245 --> 03:34.948
{\an4}It seems like you
don't want to give up
on your relationship.

03:35.014 --> 03:36.282
(Nikki)
I really feel for Shanda.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.550
{\an8}None of this is her fault,

03:37.617 --> 03:39.485
{\an8}and it's definitely not
the kids' fault either.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.788
My parents have been together
for over 39 years,

03:41.854 --> 03:44.123
and divorce was never
an option for them.

03:44.190 --> 03:47.193
That's why Miss Nikki Baby
is only dating.

03:47.260 --> 03:50.697
I'm not committing to anybody
until I know I'm fully ready.

03:50.763 --> 03:52.932
{\an1}You need to get it together.
'Cause that's some bull(bleep).

03:52.999 --> 03:54.467
And you know that.

03:54.534 --> 03:56.703
{\an5}I know, I don't wanna...
Just-- What's going on
with you, boo?

03:56.769 --> 03:58.471
{\an1}Girl...

03:58.538 --> 04:01.007
{\an1}Long story short, they
found out about each other.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.241
{\an6}Damn.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.241
At this point,

04:02.308 --> 04:03.876
I'm just really
confused, girl,

04:03.943 --> 04:06.279
{\an1}'cause I don't know what
it is I want with him or her.

04:06.346 --> 04:08.247
Do you even want
to be with him? Like...

04:08.314 --> 04:10.717
I don't even know if I want to
be in a relationship right now.

04:10.783 --> 04:13.653
{\an4}You know, as of now, I'm
in a really confused space
in my life.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.055
{\an1}I haven't really been myself,
I haven't been able to...

04:16.122 --> 04:17.757
What do you mean?

04:17.824 --> 04:19.659
{\an1}When my brother
passed away last year,

04:19.726 --> 04:21.494
so that was, like,
very hard for me.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.163
I haven't really been able to,
like, be committed to somebody

04:24.230 --> 04:25.865
{\an1}'cause I've been
so hurt, you know.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.400
I can understand that.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.869
{\an4}And so I feel like
I'm just going through
my own motion, girl.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.505
{\an1}I decided to take it
upon myself to help my family.

04:32.572 --> 04:35.008
{\an1}They're moving out the house
that he passed away in.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.743
{\an1}I'm helping them
pack his stuff up and...

04:36.809 --> 04:39.145
{\an6}So hard.

04:36.809 --> 04:39.145
It's hard, and you know,

04:39.212 --> 04:42.248
{\an1}I have a lot of pain inside,
too, that they don't see, girl.

04:42.315 --> 04:43.650
You know what I'm saying?

04:43.716 --> 04:45.718
{\an1}They don't see all the hurt
that I'm going through.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.353
It's really good to have
a friend like Shanda

04:47.420 --> 04:49.255
that I could really talk to
and trust.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.457
It's been very hard for me
to open up to people

04:51.524 --> 04:53.192
about what's happened
with my brother.

04:53.259 --> 04:56.663
I've been going through a lot,
and dating Rosa and Safaree,

04:56.729 --> 04:59.432
it's just been helping me mask
the pain that I feel inside.

04:59.499 --> 05:02.001
Maybe it wasn't the right way
of going about it,

05:02.068 --> 05:04.470
but I was using anything I could
to distract myself

05:04.537 --> 05:06.239
from the heartache
I was going through.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.474
Are you in good standing
with either of them, or--

05:08.541 --> 05:10.343
{\an1}I haven't spoken
to either of them, girl.

05:10.410 --> 05:11.611
{\an3}Seriously?

05:11.678 --> 05:13.479
{\an1}I'm gonna clean it up.
Don't worry, girl.

05:20.586 --> 05:23.022
{\an8}(Brandi)
Last night, that thirsty
little girl "Ho-niece"

05:23.089 --> 05:26.292
tried to spread rumors
about me and my family.

05:26.359 --> 05:29.929
Girl, please, you have no idea
what type of situation

05:29.996 --> 05:32.265
your so-called Becky
put me in.

05:32.331 --> 05:34.367
I'm in the middle
of this court case,

05:34.434 --> 05:36.469
so I cannot talk details,

05:36.536 --> 05:38.905
but the truth
will come out soon.

05:38.971 --> 05:40.039
{\an1}What's up?

05:40.106 --> 05:41.808
Oh, my goodness,
it took everything in me

05:41.874 --> 05:43.643
not to wake you up
last night.

05:43.710 --> 05:44.711
Wake me up?

05:44.777 --> 05:46.245
Baby, yesterday afternoon,

05:46.312 --> 05:49.549
{\an1}I went to that bull(bleep)
listening party of Moniece's.

05:49.615 --> 05:53.586
This bitch gets up there
and goes, "So, Brandi,

05:53.653 --> 05:55.755
"Becky contacted me,

05:55.822 --> 05:58.591
and you have a (bleep)
court date coming up."

05:58.658 --> 06:02.395
{\an4}No, she was walking about
your court case on stage
on a microphone.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.297
I wanted to beat her
(bleep) ass.

06:04.363 --> 06:07.700
Bitch, you got Masika
up here snapping you.

06:07.767 --> 06:11.504
{\an4}That's why I tell you about
these (bleep) whack bitches.
You're too nice.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.473
{\an1}She ain't get no record from me,
and it ain't even about that,

06:13.539 --> 06:15.007
and maybe if you hadn't
have came in the studio,

06:15.074 --> 06:16.642
{\an1}then she wouldn't have
been on stage like that, but...

06:16.709 --> 06:18.544
{\an5}I did you a favor.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.544
That's all besides the point.

06:18.611 --> 06:20.012
{\an1}If she went up on stage
and did that (bleep),

06:20.079 --> 06:21.748
{\an1}like I already told you,
I ain't (bleep) with her no more

06:21.814 --> 06:23.416
{\an1}after that (bleep)
at the studio that day.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.852
{\an5}You my peoples, like,
I don't choose sides
with the wrong side.

06:25.918 --> 06:27.754
{\an5}(Max)
I don't know what type
of crazy lies

06:27.820 --> 06:29.522
Moniece is spreading
right now,

06:29.589 --> 06:31.591
{\an8}but one thing I know
is you don't talk about people's

06:31.657 --> 06:34.060
{\an8}personal business or
court business in the streets,

06:34.127 --> 06:35.862
{\an8}especially me and my family.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.163
As far as I'm concerned,

06:37.230 --> 06:39.298
if Masika wanna join
the Moniece fan club,

06:39.365 --> 06:41.467
then she can go holler
at the next man

06:41.534 --> 06:42.969
and try to get
some music from him

06:43.035 --> 06:44.504
to help her
whack-ass career.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.205
I appreciate
you supporting me.

06:46.272 --> 06:47.440
{\an1}I'm gonna
always support you.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.575
{\an1}I just want you to be smart,
because, in life,

06:49.642 --> 06:51.944
{\an1}you can't fight all
your battles with your fists,

06:52.011 --> 06:53.146
even though we want to.

06:53.212 --> 06:54.947
{\an1}You gotta use your brain
and your intellect.

06:55.014 --> 06:56.182
And you gotta play chess.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.184
{\an1}She is not going to get away
with this (bleep).

06:58.251 --> 07:00.219
{\an1}You just be positive, okay?
You gonna be okay.

07:00.286 --> 07:01.521
{\an1}I'm gonna
deal with it, okay?

07:01.587 --> 07:02.755

(cheering and applause)

07:40.293 --> 07:41.794
Thank you.

07:41.861 --> 07:44.797
Me and my producers came up with
this song "Black Cinderella,"

07:44.864 --> 07:47.300
because that's pretty much
how I felt at the time.

07:47.366 --> 07:49.669
I'm sitting at home
while Willie is lying on me,

07:49.735 --> 07:51.938
and I'm just trying to have
a peaceful pregnancy.

07:52.004 --> 07:55.374
I really debated on putting this
record out because, right now,

07:55.441 --> 07:57.476
Willie and I are actually
in a good space.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.846
Not only did you sound good,
but that (bleep) was catchy.

07:59.912 --> 08:01.547
{\an9}Thank you.

07:59.912 --> 08:01.547
{\an8}(Nia)
I loved it.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.816
{\an7}So fill us in. Where'd
the inspirations come from?

08:03.883 --> 08:05.117
{\an8}'Cause I think
I have an idea.

08:05.184 --> 08:06.519
{\an8}We need all the tea.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.087
{\an8}Well, I--
I was feeling like

08:08.154 --> 08:11.424
I was by myself
while the person...

08:11.490 --> 08:12.658
The Willie.

08:12.725 --> 08:14.160
...that I was supposed
to be, you know,

08:14.227 --> 08:16.629
{\an1}enjoying my pregnancy with,
was out on tour

08:16.696 --> 08:19.599
{\an5}and popping bottles
and with the bitches
and taking pictures.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.067
{\an4}Popping models and bottles
and doing everything.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.067
{\an3}Yeah.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.501
And you know, that's
the hard thing, like,

08:22.568 --> 08:24.170
we'll be talking,
we'll be having

08:24.237 --> 08:25.771
these beautiful
conversations and...

08:25.838 --> 08:27.273
{\an1}And in the back
of your head, you're like,

08:27.340 --> 08:28.808
{\an1}"This (bleep) gonna be
different tomorrow."

08:28.875 --> 08:30.176
Yeah.
And here's the thing.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.178
I had a conversation
with Willie about it.

08:32.245 --> 08:35.214
{\an1}My concern are the bitches,
the smoking weed, the--

08:35.280 --> 08:36.649
{\an1}Who he has
around your child.

08:36.716 --> 08:39.150
He's about to come here,
once he finishes his tour,

08:39.217 --> 08:41.787
{\an5}so, I mean,
I'm sure we'll sit down
and talk about all that.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.923
{\an1}So you guys
are on good terms.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.324
And it's like,
we talk every single day.

08:45.391 --> 08:46.692
{\an4}Yeah.

08:45.391 --> 08:46.692
But on the same sentence.

08:46.759 --> 08:50.129
Like, he was acting
the fool a few days ago.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.564
{\an5}A few days ago.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.564
So it's like, I--

08:51.631 --> 08:52.965
I really want
to embrace it

08:53.032 --> 08:54.834
and accept it,
but I just don't know.

08:54.901 --> 08:57.236
{\an5}(Masika)
Willie's been on tour
almost since Kara was born,

08:57.303 --> 08:59.672
but I'm really happy that
he's finally coming to L.A.

08:59.739 --> 09:01.741
so they can spend some
one-on-one time together,

09:01.807 --> 09:03.609
we can get some
family bonding time,

09:03.676 --> 09:06.379
{\an5}and we've really
been getting along great,
so I'm looking forward to it.

09:06.445 --> 09:08.748
{\an1}I wanted to do something kinda
cute and intimate and nice.

09:08.814 --> 09:10.283
Test the waters.

09:10.349 --> 09:13.119
Unlike Miss Moniece's
listening party that--

09:13.185 --> 09:14.921
{\an1}Mine was nice.
It just went left.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.422
{\an5}Her what?

09:14.987 --> 09:16.422
But it was nice.

09:16.489 --> 09:17.757
Oh, she didn't tell you
about her listening?

09:17.823 --> 09:19.725
I don't know about this.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.627
{\an1}You know how I feel
at this point about Brandi?

09:21.694 --> 09:25.698
{\an1}Bitch, you can choke on your
husband's dirty (bleep) and die.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.401
{\an1}Like, at this point, look,
this all I wanna see from you.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.403
{\an1}I don't wanna see nothing else
but this, bitch.

09:30.469 --> 09:32.071
{\an3}(laughter)

09:32.138 --> 09:35.474
{\an1}I know for a fact
that she's a (bleep) mom.

09:35.541 --> 09:38.077
A Becky crept into my DMs,

09:38.144 --> 09:41.047
so once day Brandi decides
to go to the woman's house,

09:41.113 --> 09:42.748
looking for Max.

09:42.815 --> 09:45.551
Brandi attacks her,
and she's arrested.

09:45.618 --> 09:48.054
{\an1}Picture her on stage saying
all this to the audience.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.221
You said that
on stage?

09:49.288 --> 09:51.357
{\an1}Yes, and let me
tell you why!

09:51.424 --> 09:53.726
{\an1}Everyone came for me
as a mother.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.528
{\an6}True.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.528
And I'm just at a point now

09:55.594 --> 09:58.130
{\an1}where it's like, I'm trying
not to put my hands on people.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.700
There will be plenty of
listening parties for me

10:00.766 --> 10:03.669
in my future, but the time
to chop Brandi down

10:03.736 --> 10:05.304
down was right then
and there.

10:05.371 --> 10:07.473
All she does is attack
my motherhood,

10:07.540 --> 10:10.242
and it's about time
that I showed the world

10:10.309 --> 10:13.379
what a fake, phony,
fraudulent bitch she is.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.681
So I took the opportunity
with great pride.

10:15.748 --> 10:18.484
I know better than anybody
that you're not a bad mother.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.486
{\an1}Thank you, pookie.
Mwah!

10:20.553 --> 10:22.421
{\an5}Aww, look at this moment
we just had, a mother's
little break.

10:22.488 --> 10:23.756
{\an1}I know, this is the real
mommies club.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.624
Real mommies club.
Let's keep it here.

10:25.691 --> 10:26.892
{\an5}Keep it right, keep it tight.

10:25.691 --> 10:26.892
{\an3}Yes.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.529
{\an8}(announcer)
Coming up...

10:30.596 --> 10:31.797
{\an8}Have you spoke
to Masika?

10:31.864 --> 10:33.666
{\an7}I just want to make
this (bleep) clear with her.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.501
{\an7}"I don't want to be
in a relationship with you.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.103
{\an7}"I just want to be
my daughter's father.

10:37.169 --> 10:39.505
{\an7}She's your family,
and I'm your baby father."

10:39.572 --> 10:41.574
{\an8}You're a very
resourceful person.

10:41.640 --> 10:42.708
{\an8}I try to be.

10:42.775 --> 10:45.211
{\an8}You said you had
a little sex tapey-tape?

10:45.277 --> 10:48.247
{\an8}Tell your fat-ass mama
to wear it!

10:48.314 --> 10:49.782
{\an8}(bleep) you! (bleep) you!

10:49.849 --> 10:51.083
{\an8}(overlapping arguing)

10:57.323 --> 10:59.658
♪♪

11:02.361 --> 11:06.232
I'm just sick of it. Ho-niece
is always messing with somebody.

11:06.298 --> 11:08.768
{\an8}And now she's made it a point
to go after Brandi.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.637
It's about time somebody took
that battery out of her back

11:11.704 --> 11:13.606
and put her in her place.

11:13.672 --> 11:15.808
When Jason and I were
chatting the other day,

11:15.875 --> 11:18.210
he gave up some really good dirt
on Moniece.

11:18.277 --> 11:20.079
So I'm hoping that Jason

11:20.146 --> 11:23.215
could give me more details
about this dirt today.

11:23.282 --> 11:24.583
Thank you for coming
to meet me, first of all.

11:24.650 --> 11:25.618
{\an1}Of course.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.654
So I'm actually...

11:28.721 --> 11:31.457
in, like,
a hard spot right now.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.958
What's going on?

11:33.025 --> 11:37.196
{\an1}Me and a friend, we get
invited to a listening party.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.765
The someone
who invited us...

11:39.832 --> 11:41.567
gets on the mic...

11:41.634 --> 11:44.103
and airs out
my friend's business

11:44.170 --> 11:46.505
in front of everyone
at the listening party.

11:46.572 --> 11:47.673
{\an5}(Jason)
This girl really thinks
that I didn't know

11:47.740 --> 11:49.608
about Moniece's stunt
last night?

11:49.675 --> 11:51.510
I already knew
that she put Brandi on blast.

11:51.577 --> 11:53.379
{\an8}But Princess is gonna
have to give me information

11:53.446 --> 11:54.413
{\an8}that's gonna help me out.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.714
Who was the artist?

11:55.781 --> 11:57.083
I wouldn't really
call her an artist.

11:57.149 --> 11:58.984
{\an4}Okay.

11:57.149 --> 11:58.984
{\an3}Moniece.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.187
{\an1}Yeah, I wouldn't call her
an artist, either.

12:01.253 --> 12:02.421
{\an6}(laughing)

12:01.253 --> 12:02.421
What was she doing?

12:02.488 --> 12:04.156
She started talking
about this girl,

12:04.223 --> 12:05.791
how my friend
attacked her.

12:05.858 --> 12:08.828
{\an1}No...
On the microphone?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.162
{\an5}On the microphone.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.162
In front of everybody?

12:10.229 --> 12:11.630
In front of everybody.

12:11.697 --> 12:13.866
{\an5}Okay, who the (bleep)--

12:11.697 --> 12:13.866
I just lost it.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.067
Who are we talking about?

12:15.134 --> 12:16.769
You promise that

12:16.836 --> 12:18.437
it's not gonna
affect you helping me?

12:18.504 --> 12:21.607
{\an1}I got your back, but I need
to know who we're talking about.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.509
{\an3}Brandi.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.377
For Princess, anything.

12:25.444 --> 12:29.014
But for Brandi,
I do recall about a year ago,

12:29.081 --> 12:31.350
she felt the need to throw
a drink in my face

12:31.417 --> 12:32.651
and call me SpongeBob.

12:32.718 --> 12:34.987
Listen, I'm not gonna
talk to your Chihuahua.

12:35.054 --> 12:36.222
{\an5}(Nikki)
Chihuahua?
Hold on, baby.

12:36.288 --> 12:37.490
You calling the--

12:37.556 --> 12:39.558
You like water
thrown on you?

12:39.625 --> 12:42.094
But if she can get Brandi
to fess up an apology,

12:42.161 --> 12:44.730
beg forgiveness,
maybe a nice little gift,

12:44.797 --> 12:46.165
then maybe we can talk.

12:46.232 --> 12:49.201
{\an1}But what did you
have in mind?

12:49.268 --> 12:51.770
Well... I know that you
brought it up before.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.439
{\an1}Oh, Lord.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.975
And you said you had
a little sex tapey-tape?

12:57.910 --> 12:59.011
{\an1}Um...

12:59.078 --> 13:00.312
(both laugh)

13:00.379 --> 13:02.715
I know that you know
someone that has that.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.818
Oh, yeah, I know a guy that
has a sex tape with Moniece.

13:05.885 --> 13:08.220
I don't know exactly when she
was messing around with the guy,

13:08.287 --> 13:10.956
but maybe she was trying
to fill the void from Lil Fizz.

13:11.023 --> 13:13.359
I mean, this guy is a rapper,
too, after all,

13:13.425 --> 13:16.228
but Brandi's gotta
give me a whole lot of (bleep)

13:16.295 --> 13:17.796
for me to give up
what I got.

13:17.863 --> 13:18.797
Can I at least see it?

13:18.864 --> 13:20.733
{\an5}It's amazing.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.733
It's amazing?

13:20.799 --> 13:22.301
{\an1}It's not amazing in the sense
that her performance

13:22.368 --> 13:24.370
{\an1}reserv-- deserves
some type of Stellar Award,

13:24.436 --> 13:26.705
{\an1}but I mean, you know,
she's--

13:26.772 --> 13:28.707
{\an1}You definitely get the back
shots, for sure.

13:28.774 --> 13:30.342
{\an1}This is a priceless
receipt.

13:30.409 --> 13:31.911
{\an1}For me to give it
to Brandi?

13:31.977 --> 13:33.512
{\an1}I mean, she's cool,
I don't hate her.

13:33.579 --> 13:34.547
{\an1}I don't have
a problem with her,

13:34.613 --> 13:35.814
but I just don't
(bleep) with her.

13:35.881 --> 13:38.517
Will you just at least
sit down with her?

13:40.352 --> 13:42.721
I really need this.
I really need this.

13:42.788 --> 13:45.958
{\an4}If you really want me to
and it's a favor for you,
I'll do it.

13:46.025 --> 13:46.959
{\an3}Thank you.

13:47.026 --> 13:47.960
(clicking tongue)

13:55.634 --> 13:56.835
{\an1}(whispering)
Hey, Mom.

13:56.902 --> 13:58.304
{\an3}Hey.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.906
I knew that my mom
would be upset that we eloped,

14:00.973 --> 14:03.542
but I did not think that she
would throw a champagne glass

14:03.609 --> 14:06.445
in front of all of our friends
and embarrass us like that.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.148
At this point, she needs
to just be happy for us.

14:09.215 --> 14:10.416
I'm not sure
if I like the hair.

14:10.482 --> 14:11.917
{\an1}Really?
I love my hair.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.286
I don't think I like that.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.021
{\an8}I know it's gonna
take her a minute

14:16.088 --> 14:18.190
{\an8}to get over how we did it,

14:18.257 --> 14:21.460
{\an8}but I'm just hoping that
she'll understand my heart

14:21.527 --> 14:23.963
and that I really
just want us to all

14:24.029 --> 14:25.531
be a close-knitted family.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.633
{\an1}It's been, like,
super weird and awkward,

14:27.700 --> 14:30.836
{\an1}'cause I don't like us
being distant and, you know,

14:30.903 --> 14:33.172
A1 feels all weird and...

14:33.239 --> 14:34.406
He should feel weird.

14:34.473 --> 14:36.508
He feels like you just
still don't like him,

14:36.575 --> 14:38.244
{\an1}no matter
what he does, so...

14:38.310 --> 14:40.613
Well, did he tell you
how he treated me

14:40.679 --> 14:42.314
when I came to
pick the dogs up?

14:42.381 --> 14:43.849
Yeah, he told me,
he told me how you

14:43.916 --> 14:45.484
broke our wedding picture.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.087
He provoked me by
putting it in my face,

14:48.153 --> 14:50.389
knowing that I was still
trying to get over

14:50.456 --> 14:52.524
or at least accept
what had happened.

14:52.591 --> 14:54.226
{\an1}You didn't think about me
before you broke the picture?

14:54.293 --> 14:57.096
{\an5}Hell no, did you
think about me before
you broke my heart?

14:57.162 --> 14:58.264
Oh, my God, Mom.

14:58.330 --> 14:59.665
Give a (bleep)
about your picture.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.533

I don't think
you even feel sorry.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.441
{\an1}I want you to try
to accept A1 as my husband,

15:09.508 --> 15:11.877
{\an1}just, where it could be
positive and happy

15:11.944 --> 15:15.014
{\an1}and like, you know,
it's like, life is short,

15:15.080 --> 15:17.950
{\an4}like, where we could just
enjoy each other as family
and not--

15:18.017 --> 15:20.586
I will--
I will work on that.

15:20.653 --> 15:21.854
Okay, thank you.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.291
You know, um, I will,

15:25.357 --> 15:28.661

something for me.

15:28.727 --> 15:29.828
{\an1}What?

15:29.895 --> 15:32.264
You know, I hike
five days a week,

15:32.331 --> 15:36.035

I just can't seem

15:36.101 --> 15:38.003
to get this gone.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.806

some lipo,

15:49.014 --> 15:52.551
{\an8}This could never mend
the hurt that I feel

15:52.618 --> 15:54.820
{\an8}not being a part
of my daughter's wedding.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.555
But for her
to do that for me

15:56.622 --> 15:58.857
would pacify some of the hurt
that I have.

15:58.924 --> 16:01.794

{\an1}Girl, bye!

16:06.498 --> 16:09.134
You know what? I'm not even mad
at your hustle, though.

16:09.201 --> 16:11.203
You got a lot
of hustle in you.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.938
If we do this,
I need to know,

16:13.005 --> 16:16.208
{\an1}you are never gonna bring up
me and A1 eloping again.

16:16.275 --> 16:21.013
I can concede for now to never
bring up the terrible way

16:21.080 --> 16:23.449
that A1 decided
to marry my daughter,

16:23.515 --> 16:25.984

steps out of line again,

16:26.051 --> 16:28.253
I'm not gonna
keep my mouth shut.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.622

a positive, clean slate,

check on things,

You are so funny.

23:19.664 --> 23:23.201
{\an1}The population of Beckies
are starting to expand,

23:23.268 --> 23:24.936
{\an1}and we need to extinct
them mother(bleep).

23:25.003 --> 23:29.274
{\an1}I am not feeling good, but
I am happy to see you, always.

23:29.341 --> 23:30.642
You know I had to come
check on you.

23:30.709 --> 23:32.878
{\an1}Princess, what the (bleep)
was that? Like...

23:32.944 --> 23:35.981
I wanna drag that bitch across
the floor, but I know I cannot.

23:36.047 --> 23:37.749
I have to get her back.

23:37.816 --> 23:39.518
{\an1}I have to get
some (bleep) on her.

23:39.584 --> 23:43.321
{\an1}I've been doing my own
little digging and searching.

23:43.388 --> 23:47.225
I have dug up a few little
things that you can use.

23:47.292 --> 23:49.728
{\an1}My (bleep).
Princess!

23:49.795 --> 23:52.564
This girl is full
of surprises.

23:52.631 --> 23:55.200
{\an8}Ho-niece, you are
gonna regret the day

23:55.267 --> 23:58.170
{\an8}you ever came for me
and my family.

23:58.236 --> 23:59.404
I met up with Jason.

23:59.471 --> 24:00.906
{\an4}Jason Lee.

23:59.471 --> 24:00.906
Yes, Jason Lee.

24:00.972 --> 24:02.240
{\an1}Okay.

24:02.307 --> 24:04.075
And he basically told me

24:04.142 --> 24:06.945
he knows someone who has
a sex tape of Moniece.

24:07.012 --> 24:09.681
{\an1}Oh, my--
It's the receipt that we need.

24:09.748 --> 24:11.950
The ultimate receipt
that we need.

24:12.017 --> 24:15.420
You know, I-- I told him
that I wanted it for you.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.088
Oh, (bleep).

24:17.155 --> 24:18.523
He's pretty much saying that
he's not gonna give it to you

24:18.590 --> 24:19.858
'cause he doesn't
(bleep) with you,

24:19.925 --> 24:22.327
because you threw
the drink in his face.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.729
{\an1}Don't give up now,
we have got all the way here.

24:24.796 --> 24:27.933
Last year, Jason and I
got into a scuffle.

24:27.999 --> 24:30.202
Now it's time
to turn on the charm

24:30.268 --> 24:33.572
and fix my relationship
with Jason.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.740
{\an1}So what we have to do,
tell him,

24:35.807 --> 24:39.611
{\an1}"Jason, I want
to take you to eat."

24:39.678 --> 24:42.080
{\an1}I'm gonna be there.
I'm gonna give him...

24:42.147 --> 24:43.515
{\an6}A gift?

24:42.147 --> 24:43.515
{\an1}A gift.

24:43.582 --> 24:46.618
{\an5}(Princess)
Jason and Brandi's beef
is so last year.

24:46.685 --> 24:48.453
They just need to kiss
and make up already.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.188
We're going in
a good direction.

24:50.255 --> 24:52.824
We're off
to a good start.

24:52.891 --> 24:54.326

take it from here

for the best

there was a sex tape

{\an8}of Ho-niece out there,

27:17.936 --> 27:20.138

Jason wouldn't give it to me,

{\an8}I need Jason and Brandi

You better stop, Jason.

The last time I saw you,

28:05.383 --> 28:08.119
I was the recipient
of a cold beverage.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.121
I have a little
something for you.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.690
{\an1}Okay.
Let's see what you got.

28:12.757 --> 28:15.193
Jason, I only get
my husband gifts.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.495
Only man that gets
gifts from me.

28:19.097 --> 28:20.165
{\an1}Okay.

28:22.133 --> 28:26.204
{\an1}So is this some shade, or...
They're shades.

28:26.271 --> 28:27.972
{\an8}I'm not in the business
of charity.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.108
{\an8}Brandi's gonna
have to do a whole lot more

28:30.175 --> 28:32.210
{\an8}than hand me these shades
that probably,

28:32.277 --> 28:33.978
for all I know,
came from Chinatown.

28:34.045 --> 28:37.682
{\an4}So when I heard
you wanted this receipt,
which is a big receipt,

28:37.749 --> 28:39.884
{\an4}why would I give that away
for something that had
nothing to do with me,

28:39.951 --> 28:44.823
{\an4}on top of it with
somebody who didn't even
apologize for what they did?

28:44.889 --> 28:46.491
I'm not gonna sit up here
and play (bleep) games.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.893
I want that mother(bleep)
tape, and yes, yes,

28:48.960 --> 28:51.262
{\an1}it's a big goddamn receipt,
but I'm gonna tell you,

28:51.329 --> 28:53.331
I'm a (bleep) boss bitch,

28:53.398 --> 28:55.934
and it's not a bad thing
to (bleep) with me.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.735
And when I tell you

28:57.802 --> 28:59.737
I will be (bleep) loyal
to the end,

28:59.804 --> 29:01.272
that's a big receipt
right there, too.

29:01.339 --> 29:03.308
{\an1}Now, if you
really want it,

29:03.374 --> 29:05.176
{\an1}maybe there's
something we can do.

29:05.243 --> 29:08.012
What can I do for you,
Mr. Jason Lee?

29:08.079 --> 29:09.981

29:08.079 --> 29:09.981
Let me say this.

29:10.048 --> 29:11.015
{\an1}I think that
you have something

29:11.082 --> 29:13.351
{\an1}that I know
would move me.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.253
Oh, God.
What is this?

29:15.320 --> 29:17.722
{\an5}Growing up as a kid,
I had this movie that
I was in love with.

29:17.789 --> 29:19.724
{\an1}It was called
"Coming to America."

29:19.791 --> 29:22.460
{\an1}Remember when the princess
came in the room and she said,

29:22.527 --> 29:23.828
{\an1}"I would do
whatever you like,"

29:23.895 --> 29:26.030
{\an1}and he said, "Hop on one leg
and bark like a dog."

29:26.097 --> 29:27.465
Oh, hell no...

29:27.532 --> 29:30.735
I know where Jason
is going with this.

29:30.802 --> 29:33.037
"Chihuahua."
Bark like a dog.

29:33.104 --> 29:36.007
Yes, yes, yes, you are
very clever, my friend.

29:54.225 --> 29:56.127
Hell, yes.

29:56.194 --> 29:57.996
I'm just glad that Brandi

29:58.062 --> 29:59.864
did not let her pride
get in the way.

29:59.931 --> 30:02.634
She needs to keep focusing
on the bigger picture,

30:02.700 --> 30:04.602
which is getting back
at Moniece.

30:04.669 --> 30:06.337
Brandi may have barked,

30:06.404 --> 30:09.440
but once Moniece finds out
about what we have on her,

30:09.507 --> 30:11.409
she's gonna be
begging for our forgiveness.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.944
I kept my word.

30:13.011 --> 30:16.314
I just need to know,
are you really...

31:58.883 --> 32:01.052
Me defending myself
hurts my child.

32:01.119 --> 32:04.188
{\an5}I don't want her
to be able to Google
this (bleep) one day.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.090
{\an8}As a mom who's been
through this firsthand,

32:06.157 --> 32:07.759
{\an8}I could see
where this was headed,

32:07.825 --> 32:10.194
{\an8}and I really hoped that it
wouldn't end up this way,

32:10.261 --> 32:12.297
but unfortunately,
she's here,

32:12.363 --> 32:14.632
and all I can do
is encourage her to find

32:14.699 --> 32:17.268
the most positive way out
for the sake of her daughter.

32:17.335 --> 32:19.203
{\an1}So what's the course
of action now?

32:19.270 --> 32:21.039
I'm sitting here, like...

32:21.105 --> 32:26.010
{\an5}Like, you lied to me
about the type of father
you're gonna be

32:26.077 --> 32:27.979
and the person you're
gonna be for our child.

32:28.046 --> 32:29.681
{\an8}Willie made it very clear to me

32:29.747 --> 32:32.617
{\an8}that he wanted to be
a full-time dad,

32:32.684 --> 32:35.086
{\an8}and that has yet to happen.

32:35.153 --> 32:38.189
{\an1}My child needs a consistent
father in her life.

32:38.256 --> 32:40.925
It's just like,
he seems to think that,

32:40.992 --> 32:42.760
because she's so young,

32:42.827 --> 32:45.830
{\an1}that he can pop up later on
in life, and it's fine.

32:45.897 --> 32:48.132
And she can't miss
what she never had.

32:48.199 --> 32:50.835
{\an1}The only way
she learns to miss that

32:50.902 --> 32:53.738
{\an1}is if he does the yoyo--
he's in, he's out.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.841
{\an4}I'm not gonna sit patiently,
politely, and wait for you
to come my way.

32:56.908 --> 32:58.076
That's not happening.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.877
My daughter's
not doing that, either.

32:59.944 --> 33:01.579
You're gonna be here
or you're gonna be out.

33:01.646 --> 33:04.115
All I've ever wanted from Willie
was some consistency,

33:04.182 --> 33:06.784
so our daughter can have
a pattern with him in her life,

33:06.851 --> 33:09.020
and if he's gonna keep building
her up just to let her down,

33:09.087 --> 33:10.088
I won't allow that.

33:10.154 --> 33:12.657
{\an1}You can't be
the best mom you can be

33:12.724 --> 33:17.128
{\an1}if you're not 100%
all right.

33:17.195 --> 33:20.431

see where this is headed.

33:20.498 --> 33:21.766

40:00.431 --> 40:01.999
{\an8}I just wanted to start over

40:02.066 --> 40:03.601
{\an8}and start clean
and be truthful to you.

40:03.667 --> 40:05.402
{\an8}You're not lying again?

40:05.469 --> 40:07.138
{\an9}No.

40:07.204 --> 40:09.273
{\an7}We're gonna work on
trying to make this serious?

40:09.340 --> 40:11.575
{\an7}Yeah.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.575
{\an8}I'm not gonna talk to nobody

40:11.642 --> 40:13.644
{\an8}and you're not gonna
talk to nobody else,

40:13.711 --> 40:14.812
{\an8}including Rosa, right?

40:17.148 --> 40:18.115
{\an8}They towing your car.

40:18.182 --> 40:19.416
{\an8}Yo!

40:19.483 --> 40:20.551
{\an8}Who sent you to do this?

40:20.618 --> 40:21.919
{\an8}You wanna play games?

40:21.986 --> 40:24.188
{\an8}It wasn't your money
that (bleep) paid for it!

40:24.255 --> 40:26.290
{\an7}She keeps talking,
there's gonna be a problem.

40:26.357 --> 40:28.125
{\an8}I don't give a (bleep)!

40:28.192 --> 40:29.960
{\an8}It's hard getting
out of a marriage right.

40:30.027 --> 40:33.130
{\an7}Yeah, but, Ma, I've only
lived my life strategically.

40:33.197 --> 40:35.566
{\an8}(Princess)
Your mom already said she
didn't want us to get married,

40:35.633 --> 40:37.735
{\an8}and then you got me
coming up to this?

40:37.802 --> 40:40.271
{\an7}You can't come up on my set
and tell me what to do

40:40.337 --> 40:41.672
{\an8}in front of people
I'm working with.

40:41.739 --> 40:42.840
{\an7}Feel like you're doing this
just to, like,

40:42.907 --> 40:44.308
{\an8}get it out your system.

40:44.375 --> 40:45.576
{\an8}You haven't been
answering your phone.

40:45.643 --> 40:46.811
{\an8}Didn't come home last night.

40:46.877 --> 40:48.712
{\an7}I'm having a good time
up there, actually.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.548
{\an8}Does your mom have
anything to do with this?

40:50.614 --> 40:51.849
{\an7}You wanna have
a smart-ass mouth

40:51.916 --> 40:54.418
{\an7}or do you want to have
an intelligent conversation?
