00:05.130 --> 00:06.631
Do you know where I can find

00:06.715 --> 00:08.967
four D batteries for my flashlight?

00:09.467 --> 00:12.721
Um, aisle 30... I think.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.472
This is aisle 30.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.558
15... Three.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.227
Stop guessing. Either you know
or you don't know.

00:19.227 --> 00:21.396
Sir, I'm trying to help you.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.402
Hey, you! Wait!

00:34.868 --> 00:35.827
Batteries?

00:37.328 --> 00:38.538
You just passed them.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.040
Right through that door, sir.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.499
Thank you.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.093
I hate this place.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.044

<i>As a stylist, you must remember</i>

01:26.044 --> 01:29.214
a bad haircut can cost
your client their job

01:29.214 --> 01:31.007
- even get them beat up.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.927
That's why we practice on senior citizens.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.095
Miss Krezmer?

01:35.595 --> 01:38.723
My senior citizen is
too small for my chair.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.100
Can I get a new one?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.434
Luanne, please!

01:41.851 --> 01:43.353
Some of them can hear you.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.772
Would you step into my office?

01:47.148 --> 01:50.443
I haven't received your tuition
check for this trimester.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.528
Oh, really?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.363
Um, I mailed it.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.864
Oh, you did, did you?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.033
That's good, because if you hadn't,

01:57.117 --> 01:59.035
I would have had to suspend you,

01:59.119 --> 02:01.830
but since you did mail it,
why don't we just sit here

02:01.830 --> 02:03.581
and wait until it comes?

02:10.880 --> 02:12.632
I didn't mail the check.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.592
- If I don't pay my tuition,

02:14.676 --> 02:16.761
I can't go to beauty school anymore.

02:16.928 --> 02:19.305
Can you believe that?

02:19.389 --> 02:20.598
How much was it again?

02:20.682 --> 02:22.225
300 dollars.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.227
Huh. All I have is 400 dollars,

02:24.227 --> 02:25.979
and that's going towards
my new trampoline.

02:26.437 --> 02:29.399
The trampoline I have now is good,
but... you know.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.401
Yeah. Okay.

02:31.901 --> 02:33.027
Night, Buckley.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.657
Okay, Hank try turning it back on now.

02:38.074 --> 02:41.244
<i>Because feeling fresh
is important to a woman.</i>

02:42.829 --> 02:45.456
Dad, can I come back in now?

02:45.540 --> 02:46.666
Not yet, son.

02:46.666 --> 02:47.750
Stay in the kitchen.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.212
Okay, Bobby, you can come back in.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.382
<i>Your garden will be a horn of plenty</i>

02:54.382 --> 02:55.300
<i>with Mega Lo mulch</i>

02:55.842 --> 02:57.886
<i>in easy-to-lift, 50-pound bags.</i>

02:57.886 --> 03:01.055
Mm, that Chuck Mangione is one class act.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.932
<i>And now Mega Lo Mart has propane</i>

03:03.308 --> 03:05.810
<i>and propane accessories at Mega Lo prices,</i>

03:05.894 --> 03:08.354
-<i>and it fuels so good.</i>

03:08.730 --> 03:10.565
Propane at Mega Lo Mart?

03:10.565 --> 03:12.192
Uh, Bobby, leave the room.

03:13.568 --> 03:14.986
You bastards!

03:17.280 --> 03:20.158
All right, all right.
Everybody settle down.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.536
Mega Lo Mart may be selling propane now,

03:23.620 --> 03:25.580
but they're in for the fight
of their lives.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.040
Tell 'em, Buck.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.793
Well, there's no way
we can compete with their prices

03:30.877 --> 03:33.671
but Debbie and I stayed late
last night and...

03:34.339 --> 03:36.591
and after that, we came up with a plan.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.051
Yes! We have a plan!

03:38.051 --> 03:40.136
Good work, Buck, and, uh...

03:40.220 --> 03:41.471
Debbie.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.306
We're going to beat Mega Lo Mart

03:43.306 --> 03:47.018
by giving the customer what
they can't, the personal touch.

03:47.518 --> 03:51.648
A little program I'm going
to call service with a hug.

03:55.026 --> 03:55.902
You're serious?

04:01.199 --> 04:03.201
Hi. Welcome to Strickland Propane

04:03.201 --> 04:04.619
service with a...

04:06.955 --> 04:07.956
- hug.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.792
I'm really sorry about that.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.169
Now, what can we do for you?

04:13.253 --> 04:14.337
Well, I was just wondering.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.381
Do you honor Mega Lo Mart coupons?

04:16.381 --> 04:18.258
No, but for pennies more,

04:18.258 --> 04:21.469
you get the same propane
and Strickland service.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.012
Well, how many pennies?

04:24.013 --> 04:25.306
Several hundred.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.767
I hugged you!

04:34.691 --> 04:36.651
Sure, son, the Voyager Char King

04:36.651 --> 04:39.195
does cost a little less here
at Mega Lo Mart,

04:39.821 --> 04:43.283
but when you buy at Strickland
135 Los Gatos Road,

04:43.283 --> 04:45.159
you don't just get a grill.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.453
You get a spatula and a friend.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.247
A good spatula.

04:49.247 --> 04:52.041
Sir, there's no yelling
in the propane department.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.127
Some of these gases are extremely...

04:54.627 --> 04:56.129
volubuleous.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.256
Well, Buckley, I have a complaint.

04:58.256 --> 05:01.301
I would like to talk circles
around the person

05:01.301 --> 05:03.720
who runs your propane department.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.721
Hey.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.473
They didn't want me making keys anymore.

05:07.557 --> 05:10.351
I don't know whether to laugh or vomit.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.189
Say, I want to thank you guys

05:15.273 --> 05:18.401
for continuing to buy
your propane from Strickland.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.278
You're about due for a fill-up, Dale.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.780
What's it been five, six cookouts?

05:22.864 --> 05:24.949
No, I, I'm all set.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.784
Huh. Well, that's odd.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.329
The gauge must be broken.
It says your tank's full.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.288
Here...

05:31.581 --> 05:32.790
Mega Lo Mart?

05:37.086 --> 05:40.048
I am changing the seating plan
in my classroom.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.301
Mr. Garcia has been hiding
from me for too long.

05:44.093 --> 05:46.054
Welcome to the front row, Mr. Garcia.

05:47.305 --> 05:48.639
Are you listening, Hank?

05:48.723 --> 05:51.059
I got to come up
with some kind of battle plan.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.561
We're hugging our way
down the crapper, here.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.856
Uncle Hunk, Auntie Peg.
Can I come in?

05:56.856 --> 05:57.815
- No.
- Yes.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.359
Now,

05:59.817 --> 06:02.195
I didn't want to ask you for money...

06:02.195 --> 06:03.988
That's a good instinct, Luanne.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.031
Go on, honey.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.075
They won't let me back
in the beauty academy

06:07.075 --> 06:12.038
unless I pay them 300 dollars,
and I can't make 300 dollars until

06:12.038 --> 06:14.374
I'm a rich and famous
Hollywood makeup artist.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.958
Yep.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.420
You got yourself a real catch-22 there.
Good night.

06:21.506 --> 06:25.343
Now, sir, I know we could never match
Mega Lo Mart's prices,

06:25.343 --> 06:28.763
but I thought maybe we could
get ourselves a spokesperson

06:28.763 --> 06:32.475
the way Mega Lo mart cashes in
on Chuck Mangione's star power.

06:32.934 --> 06:36.562
Now, I've done some research
on this Zamfir fella,

06:36.646 --> 06:37.605
and I found out

06:37.605 --> 06:40.608
he's sold more albums worldwide
than the Beatles.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.068
His music's better, too.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.736
Hank, it's too late.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.907
I've, uh... I've decided to shut down
this branch of Strickland Propane.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.951
What? No! Sir, you...

06:50.243 --> 06:51.411
We can't give up.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.038
Hank, listen, I got four more
branches to think about.

06:54.122 --> 06:57.125
Sometimes, you got to cut off
a finger to save the hand.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.376
I got to let you go.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.461
You're... firing me?

07:00.545 --> 07:02.797
I can't even afford
to give you a severance package,

07:02.797 --> 07:06.259
but, uh, you can have five minutes
at the office supply cabinet.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.054
Make a basket out of your shirt, honey.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.279
Take your damn batteries back!

07:26.279 --> 07:27.738
- Take them back!

07:27.822 --> 07:28.823
Bastards!

07:33.161 --> 07:34.871
I don't want them! You can have them!

07:36.247 --> 07:39.250
Boy, you get a lot of batteries
for four bucks.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.878
Bastards!

07:49.093 --> 07:52.138
Dad, what about this big box of tissues?

07:52.138 --> 07:53.806
Is it from Mega Lo Mart?

07:53.890 --> 07:56.309
No, but it was touching something that is.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.644
- Throw it out.
- Well, folks, there is no chance in heck

07:58.728 --> 07:59.937
we are going to lose this house

08:00.021 --> 08:01.647
because I have spent a lot of time

08:01.731 --> 08:04.567
thinking and preparing us
for this exact moment.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.526
You what?

08:05.693 --> 08:08.613
Hank, I married you
for better or for worse.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.199
So during the better,
I planned for the worse.

08:11.199 --> 08:14.535
I saved all our old curtains
so I could make clothes for Bobby.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.371
We will grow our own vegetables
and eat carrots for dessert.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.042
I thought you said
we were going to be okay.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.794
From now on, I'll be
the breadwinner of the house.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.339
- Oh, not that you're the bread-loser.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.632
We're all winners here.

08:34.847 --> 08:35.765
<i>- Perd√≥name...
- Mm-mm.</i>

08:36.224 --> 08:37.141
<i>- ...Hermana.
- Mm.</i>

08:37.225 --> 08:39.143
Why is the pope holding that gun?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.895
That is not the pope.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.772
It's Monsignor Martinez.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.691
<i>Vaya con dios.</i>

08:46.943 --> 08:48.444
Hmm. Wanted...

08:48.528 --> 08:52.031
One hard-working man
to replace four who weren't.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.450
Stop looking, you found him.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.245
You'll notice that the door
on your left is open,

08:57.245 --> 08:59.497
and if you're not interested
in making money,

08:59.497 --> 09:01.666
I want you to walk right out that door

09:01.666 --> 09:04.085
because this is not for you.

09:04.085 --> 09:07.171
Can I just ask,
what exactly are we selling?

09:07.255 --> 09:09.006
That's a very good question.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.883
You'll be selling...

09:11.259 --> 09:12.468
Opportunity.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.972
With your initial investment
of 300 dollars,

09:15.972 --> 09:18.558
you can make up to 60,000 dollars

09:18.933 --> 09:22.228
or as much as 200,000 dollars.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.896
- Oh.
- It's up to you.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.690
You, you...

09:25.815 --> 09:27.817
- You, you!

09:28.568 --> 09:29.902
What's in the box?

09:29.986 --> 09:32.113
All right, eager beaver
it's time for us to tell you.

09:32.488 --> 09:37.660
Inside each of these boxes
are 24 smaller boxes

09:37.660 --> 09:39.829
filled with dreams.

09:40.496 --> 09:43.416
Oh, gosh. We're not selling
steak knives, are we?

09:43.416 --> 09:45.835
Uh... Not we, you.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.044
You, you...

09:47.128 --> 09:49.088
You, you.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.551
Uncle Hank, what's a B.T.U?

09:53.551 --> 09:55.136
British thermal unit.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.345
Oh.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.348
So there's no bacon in it at all, then.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.892
Luanne, I think you
picked up the wrong book.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.519
That's about propane.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.438
I know.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.232
I'm studying to be a propane salesman

10:08.316 --> 10:10.776
just like you used to be, Uncle Hank.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.862
That's a neat idea, Luanne.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.779
While you're at it,

10:13.863 --> 10:16.699
maybe you can fly around the world
in a weather balloon.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.994
I can, too, get a job selling propane.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.955
Hmph. Buckley said he'd hire me
at the Mega Lo Mart.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.248
Mega Lo Mart?

10:24.332 --> 10:27.752
Why don't you just go down to heck
and work for the devil?

10:27.752 --> 10:31.047
Good thing... that I don't
have dangerous brain powers

10:31.047 --> 10:33.966
or right now you'd be
in a thousand little pieces.

10:35.176 --> 10:39.889
I've answered 40 classified ads,
and I didn't get a single response.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.265
Hey, man, I know how it is.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.100
Man, you go get low down
on that money, man.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.144
You just come to that
ol' Bank of Boomhauer, man.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.898
You go get a little ol' cash advance
dang ol' additional charges may apply.

10:49.732 --> 10:53.152
Well, I appreciate that,
but we're doing fine, thanks.

10:53.152 --> 10:56.364
Peggy's landed some
extra work as a notary public.

10:56.864 --> 10:59.283
You got yourself a good man there, Hank.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.161
Uh...

11:02.161 --> 11:03.788
What did you just say, Bill?

11:09.210 --> 11:12.588
Propane is, A: flammable.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.965
nonflammable.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.718
all of the above.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.178
Hmm.

11:19.178 --> 11:22.473
Well, you can't eat propane, so...

11:22.473 --> 11:24.850
Oh, for God's sake, it's flammable.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.727
I could have gotten that!

11:26.811 --> 11:28.354
You would have never gotten that.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.522
Uncle Hank!

11:40.241 --> 11:43.536
How could such a good cop
become such a bad priest?

11:43.911 --> 11:45.955
Well, I threw out my ethics,

11:45.955 --> 11:48.082
and I notarized Velma Throckmorton's will.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.918
I hope those cats know
how to run a toy store.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.628
Honey, did you iron
my blouse for tomorrow?

11:52.712 --> 11:55.715
No, I don't know how to iron,
and I don't want to learn.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.342
Hank, we're all
taking on extra responsibilities

11:58.426 --> 12:00.594
- because of your... situation.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.096
I'm trying, Peggy.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.390
Don't be a try-baby, Hank. Be a do-baby.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.272
<i>Mujeres. Chicas. Hombres.</i>

12:11.272 --> 12:15.985
<i>Ahora tenemos Mega Lo Mart,
gaspropano a precio mega barato.</i>

12:16.610 --> 12:18.237
Come on, Luanne.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.531
No job, no Hollywood.

12:20.531 --> 12:24.869
You can do this.
Remember, B.T.U. British thermal unit.

12:24.994 --> 12:25.995
No bacon, no bacon...

12:25.995 --> 12:27.037
Hey.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.081
I'm ready for the test, Buckley.

12:29.457 --> 12:33.085
I just pushed everything
out of my mind except propane.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.337
Well, and how to get here.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.006
You don't have to take the test now.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.549
I gave the job to somebody else.

12:47.183 --> 12:51.020
So, I guess you think
you're going to work right now.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.606
Off to sell propane in your fancy vest.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.941
Hope you like walking, though.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.818
Because I took your car keys,

12:57.902 --> 13:00.321
and I flushed them down the toilet.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.533
Luanne, have you seen my car keys?

13:07.203 --> 13:09.288
So, you know something about propane?

13:09.830 --> 13:14.043
I was assistant manager
at Strickland Propane for 15 years.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.588
Anyway, here's your tag.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.507
You've got to wear this at all times.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.175
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.343
This is Ron.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.886
Uh, hello.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.262
I'm Mr. Hill.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.015
15 years experience in propane.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.517
Wow. That's amazing.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.518
Hey, you know what?

13:30.518 --> 13:31.685
- What?
- Chicken butt.

13:32.937 --> 13:33.938
You know what that means?

13:33.938 --> 13:35.356
No, what?

13:35.356 --> 13:36.357
Chicken butt.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.609
- You got to stop saying what.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.110
- Why?
- Chicken thigh.

13:41.779 --> 13:44.907
Okay, now you got to put up
some posters in the parking lot.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.368
Chuck Mangione's giving a concert
there next week.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.246
But, wha, uh, what? Uh...

13:50.371 --> 13:51.914
Never mind.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.710
Dad, I thought you hated Mega Lo Mart.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.087
Oh, I do, son.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.755
I do, indeed.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.215
But you're working there.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.341
That's right.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.929
Are you still married to mom?

14:06.929 --> 14:08.556
Bobby, of course I am.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.307
Mm-hmm, it's true, Bobby, he is.

14:10.891 --> 14:11.767
You know, Hank,

14:11.892 --> 14:14.186
I think you should be happy
about your new job.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.438
You get to wear that smart little uniform

14:16.522 --> 14:19.275
and with the trainee badge,
you can make all kinds of mistakes.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.902
It's like a get out of jail free card.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.822
Well, now I feel great, Peggy.
Thanks very much.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.199
Let's all go dancing, what do you say?

14:27.283 --> 14:30.452
Well, forgive me, Hank,
but I am doing the best I can.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.745
You've never failed before.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.081
I don't know how to pity you
without offending you.

14:37.293 --> 14:40.170
I guess this means
we're not going dancing.

14:40.754 --> 14:43.299
Hey, Luanne, uh, listen,

14:43.299 --> 14:46.468
I'm sorry I took that job you wanted,
but you have to under...

14:46.552 --> 14:48.178
Sorry. I can't talk right now.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.722
I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.725
I'm Sir Reginald Feather Bottom the Third,

14:52.725 --> 14:55.978
and my boyfriend is going to give me a job
at the Mega Lo mart.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.314
Eee-yaw, no, he's not.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.482
I'm going to make him give it to me

15:00.566 --> 15:02.359
and ruin your life forever.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.862
- Eee-yaw, eee-yaw.
- Luanne...

15:05.446 --> 15:08.949
Eee-yaw! Eee-yaw! Eee-yaw! Eee... Yaw!

15:17.374 --> 15:19.668
Um, you work with Ron and Buckley

15:19.752 --> 15:21.295
in the propane department, right?

15:21.295 --> 15:23.839
Well, I work in the propane department

15:23.964 --> 15:25.883
while Buckley and Ron watch me.

15:25.883 --> 15:30.012
Um, could you find out
if Ron likes Stefani?

15:30.012 --> 15:31.472
- Cindi, shut up!

15:31.472 --> 15:33.390
- Shut up.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.977
'Cause she wants to sit next to him
during the Chuck Mangione concert.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.145
Shut up!

15:40.314 --> 15:44.151
Well, I think I'll go try and find
the grown-up break room.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.402
Ladies.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.738
I think that old guy likes you.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.573
- Shut up! Shut up!

15:55.496 --> 15:57.998
Hello. America loves Mega Lo Mart.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.712
Don't take it too hard, Hill.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.923
After a while you'll hardly
miss the respect.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.134
- Mark Mc Jimsey.
- You mean, the Mark Mc Jimsey,

16:09.218 --> 16:10.844
that owns just brake drums?

16:11.428 --> 16:14.890
Used to own till Mega Lo Mart
ran all of main street out of business.

16:15.265 --> 16:17.434
Now I'm just working here
in the automotive department

16:17.518 --> 16:19.520
helping feed the beast that killed me.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.982
Yep. The only place
you can find a main street these days

16:22.982 --> 16:24.358
is in Disneyland...

16:24.984 --> 16:26.777
and just try to buy a gun there.

16:26.777 --> 16:30.322
Say, you know a fella
by the name of Ray Holliday?

16:30.406 --> 16:32.074
Layaway Ray, sure.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.243
Used to go to his bait shop all the time.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.538
- So, there I was, bare-ass naked

16:38.122 --> 16:39.790
sitting in a box of night crawlers.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.000
Felt kind of funny,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.211
but it kept them alive through the night.

16:44.211 --> 16:47.756
See, that's the kind of thing you can do
when you own your own store.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.509
Here it's just one
humiliation after another.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.886
- Oh, ho. You got that right.
- I've been meaning to tell you.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.847
Alright. Break it up.
Back to work.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.348
And you, where's your trainee tag?

16:56.432 --> 16:57.307
I won't wear it.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.893
I've had 20 years' experience.
I'm not going to take this.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.186
And neither are we.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.355
Oh? Well, I guess
I'll just have to fire you then.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.948
Buckley, what the heck are you doing?

17:13.032 --> 17:16.326
You never ever want
to put stress on the valve.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.995
You'll cause a gas leak.

17:17.995 --> 17:19.747
Hey, where were you?

17:19.747 --> 17:22.791
You were supposed to set up Chuck
Mangione's dressing room with sliced pears

17:22.875 --> 17:24.585
and two percent cottage cheese.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.628
Or did you forget that, too, Hank?

17:27.504 --> 17:28.881
Trainees.

17:28.881 --> 17:29.965
You know how it is.

17:42.603 --> 17:43.812
So what do you think?

17:43.896 --> 17:46.940
I don't know, Hank. You're talking
about an act of open rebellion.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.358
Dang right I am.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.695
- They say America loves Mega Lo mart.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.656
And if we don't speak up,
everyone will think it's true.

17:54.740 --> 17:58.702
We've got to put an end to the silence
while the whole world is watching.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.829
If you want out, get out now.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.498
As for the rest of us

18:02.498 --> 18:06.210
we will be disrupting
a Chuck Mangione concert...

18:07.753 --> 18:09.296
...with kazoos.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.257
Why kazoos, Hank?

18:12.341 --> 18:14.802
Because they're portable,
they're annoying,

18:15.052 --> 18:18.097
and Mega Lo mart has them
for three bucks a case.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.723
We'll be just like Queer Nation.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.559
Or the Boston Tea Party.

18:22.643 --> 18:23.769
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.480
The Boston Tea Party. Right. Let's
go that way. That's a good way to go.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.190
- Exactly.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.650
- Uncle Hank?
- Yes?

18:29.650 --> 18:34.696
I had a lot of time to think
while I was unflushing aunt Peggy's keys,

18:35.072 --> 18:38.659
and I would like you to know
that I'm not mad at you anymore

18:38.659 --> 18:39.785
for taking my job.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.620
I was the better candidate.

18:41.620 --> 18:45.332
Oh, sure, sure. Um, can you give me a ride

18:45.332 --> 18:47.417
to the Mega Lo Mart in the morning?

18:47.501 --> 18:49.211
I'm going to break up with Buckley.

18:49.211 --> 18:53.340
As of tomorrow, your boss
is no longer my boyfriend.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.809
Why don't you get us a spot, Peggy?

19:03.809 --> 19:06.061
I've got a little business
to take care of.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.731
I know, Hank. I saw your bag of kazoos,
and I put two and two together.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.443
After 15 years of teaching,
I know a mutiny when I see one.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.070
Don't try to stop me, Peggy.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.824
- Hank!
- Yeah?

19:18.824 --> 19:21.577
Remember, honey, to hum not blow.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.538
If you blow, it tears the wax paper.

19:24.538 --> 19:25.789
I'll tell 'em.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.432
Hank, where's your kazoo?

19:43.432 --> 19:47.269
I've got something bigger in store
for Mr. Charles Mangione.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.155
Hey.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.838
- I'm breaking up with you.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.173
Do you know why?

20:16.173 --> 20:17.424
Chicken thigh.

20:17.424 --> 20:20.552
Don't make this harder than it already is.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.858
How you doin', Arlen?

20:34.942 --> 20:36.777
Are you ready to soft rock?

20:46.203 --> 20:47.454
Huh?

20:51.124 --> 20:53.043
Is, is that their new slogan?

21:02.219 --> 21:03.303
Huh?

21:04.471 --> 21:05.847
Oh, no!

21:19.695 --> 21:21.238
Hank!

21:21.446 --> 21:23.198
Chuck!

21:23.782 --> 21:25.534
- Buckley and Luanne are in there!

21:25.534 --> 21:28.954
Hey, man, this 911?
I'm dang ol' here at Mega Lo Mart.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.831
Man, gonna... boom, man.
There's a fire in there, man.

21:31.415 --> 21:34.835
And it don't dadgum, dadgum blowed
everywhere, man.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.503
I don't know some man run out there

21:36.503 --> 21:39.423
I don't know if Chuck Mangione
gonna be comin' down here...

21:39.423 --> 21:42.175
<i>Sir, you're going
to have to speak more slowly.</i>

21:42.259 --> 21:43.510
<i>I cannot understand you.</i>

21:43.510 --> 21:45.429
Dang... Ol'... Mega...

21:45.429 --> 21:49.266
Lo... Mart... Talkin'...
'bout... Dang... Ol'... Boom.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.473
- <i>Shut up!</i>
