00:05.339 --> 00:07.080
<i>Four years we sat by</i>

00:07.174 --> 00:10.463
<i>idly watching as Germany
made its second attempt to conquer Europe.</i>

00:11.136 --> 00:14.675
<i>Millions suffered,
untold numbers murdered in cold blood</i>

00:16.058 --> 00:17.094
<i>but enough was enough.</i>

00:17.976 --> 00:20.138
<i>It was time to do something
to stop the evil.</i>

00:20.771 --> 00:23.309
<i>It was time for the most
powerful country in the world</i>

00:23.524 --> 00:26.733
<i>the United States of America,
to lead the invasion.</i>

00:28.278 --> 00:31.021
<i>Normandy was where America
had elected to join the battle.</i>

00:32.156 --> 00:34.149
<i>June 6th, 1944</i>

00:34.868 --> 00:38.282
<i>the day few could live to recount
the experience to those eager to listen</i>

00:39.623 --> 00:43.913
<i>for our soldiers could not have asked
for a more difficult and perilous task.</i>

00:45.003 --> 00:48.212
<i>As their leader, I had a job to do</i>

00:49.091 --> 00:50.832
<i>one I wouldn't wish on anyone.</i>

00:51.677 --> 00:54.135
<i>These men, boys even</i>

00:54.429 --> 00:57.763
<i>many had dropped whatever they were doing
in their life at the time</i>

00:57.891 --> 00:59.723
<i>to enlist and fight these Nazis</i>

01:00.310 --> 01:01.801
<i>coming from all walks of life.</i>

01:02.187 --> 01:06.272
<i>Journalism student, farmhand,
hotel concierge</i>

01:06.984 --> 01:09.476
<i>some who have never even held a rifle
in their hands before.</i>

01:11.363 --> 01:14.652
<i>Others, seasoned veterans itching to fight.</i>

01:15.242 --> 01:17.325
<i>No matter what walk of life
we came from</i>

01:18.370 --> 01:19.736
<i>we were here for one purpose</i>

01:19.997 --> 01:20.997
<i>to go to war.</i>

01:22.791 --> 01:25.704
<i>War is not glorious, war is not romantic.</i>

01:26.378 --> 01:27.378
<i>It's a monster</i>

01:27.754 --> 01:30.838
<i>and it's capable of unimaginable
wrath and bloodshed.</i>

01:31.383 --> 01:34.421
<i>And whatever fear I felt,
I had to bury it.</i>

01:34.636 --> 01:36.844
Go! Go! Go!

01:37.431 --> 01:39.764
<i>Whatever lay ahead of us,
I would have to contend with.</i>

01:41.059 --> 01:42.766
<i>But whatever I had told myself...</i>

01:43.228 --> 01:44.469
Hyah!

01:46.356 --> 01:48.598
<i>...I never could have imagined
what was to unfold.</i>

01:50.902 --> 01:53.565
<i>We were the boys of Pointe Du Hoc.</i>

Lieutenant Colonel Rudder reporting,
General.

02:12.674 --> 02:13.710
Come in.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.292
- Son.
- Colonel.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.123
I want you to look at these maps.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.673
Operation Overlord,
planned by General Eisenhower?

02:22.309 --> 02:23.309
Yes, you're correct.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.348
These beaches are vital
to winning this war, James.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.608
You know the importance of securing
the beach landings in the coming days.

02:30.859 --> 02:34.102
Now, this ridge along Pointe Du Hoc here

02:34.363 --> 02:37.822
the Germans have artillery emplacements
covering Utah and Omaha beaches.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.982
There are also likely machine gun nests

02:40.243 --> 02:43.486
not to mention the tactical advantage
of rifle teams firing

02:43.580 --> 02:44.741
from a superior position.

02:44.790 --> 02:45.790
Yes, sir.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.124
Now, we believe the ridge line is accessible

02:48.210 --> 02:50.543
by scaling these 100-foot cliffs here.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.166
The landing force would no doubt
take on heavy fire.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.958
Once the ridge line is taken,
this highway must then be secured.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.878
Here, there are six heavy artillery units

03:00.097 --> 03:02.589
that must be neutralised
before the invasion forces land.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.348
It is vitally important

03:04.601 --> 03:06.467
these weapons are incapacitated.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.886
Thousands of lives depend on it.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.268
- That's a tough mission.
- It is, James.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.144
That's why I'm asking you to lead it.

03:13.902 --> 03:14.938
Thank you, General.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.906
I am fully aware
of the importance of the mission

03:16.947 --> 03:20.111
and I will gladly lead the 2nd Rangers
into battle with honour.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.407
You'll do fine, son.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.580
Thank you, sir.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.074
- Give 'em hell.
- You have my word, sir.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.326
Sir.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.081
Cleveland, is A-Team ready?

04:56.338 --> 04:57.338
They are.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.957
- Well, that didn't sound very confident.
- Well, I don't like it, James.

05:01.218 --> 05:04.211
Well, none of us like it, Cleveland.
However, we have a job to do.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.217
We need to secure the beaches
for our troops and the Allied forces

05:07.265 --> 05:09.131
otherwise Operation Overlord
will be a failure

05:09.559 --> 05:11.346
and it'll cost us lives, you know this.

05:11.937 --> 05:15.806
The Free French Forces claim the artillery,
in fact, has not been removed.

05:16.274 --> 05:19.142
To land at Pointe Du Hoc is pure insanity.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.147
We are gonna get slaughtered!

05:21.530 --> 05:24.819
I am very well aware of those claims,
Cleveland.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.525
However, they have been wrong
a substantial amount of times.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.115
What if they're not wrong this time?

05:30.497 --> 05:31.954
Risking lives is, is...

05:32.582 --> 05:35.040
it's not worth it, in my opinion, sir.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.619
I will admit the mission is dangerous

05:38.797 --> 05:41.710
but we're gonna need to have to take risks
in order to be successful.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.008
We have a ship full of kids out there!

05:44.177 --> 05:45.418
They're gonna get slaughtered!

05:45.554 --> 05:48.342
I regret having to ask you this, Major,
but have you been drinking?

05:49.349 --> 05:50.430
I can smell it.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.349
Oh, come on, James!

05:52.727 --> 05:54.138
Don't come at me with this angle.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.224
You know as well as I do

05:56.273 --> 05:57.959
- that this is complete bullshit!
- They are...

05:57.983 --> 06:00.396
our... our men are very well trained.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.568
They are go-getters, trained by the British!

06:02.654 --> 06:05.613
Don't insult me, sir! I did that training.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.611
I led those Rangers on a previous mission.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.193
This is a suicide mission!

06:12.956 --> 06:17.121
Those cliffs will be lined
with artillery and machine gun nests.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.209
They are gonna pick us off with ease.

06:20.255 --> 06:23.919
You are in no state of mind
to be leading our troops.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.670
Ahh!

06:25.969 --> 06:30.555
More lives will be lost if we have you
leading our men in this state of mind.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.178
You are relieved,
I will lead A-Team myself.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.969
You are relieved!

06:36.354 --> 06:37.561
Don't turn your back on me!

06:37.647 --> 06:40.327
Why don't you take a look at what
you're doing right now, Cleveland?

06:40.358 --> 06:42.315
Alcohol's doing more
to you than in this war.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.317
You want to throw away your entire career?

06:44.446 --> 06:46.904
Spend several weeks in the brig
until we're home stateside?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.030
Good luck, Colonel Rudder.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.907
God be with you.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.746
God be with you all.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.035
And here's to a clear conscience

07:01.463 --> 07:04.501
not taking those kids
to their death unnecessarily.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.383
You are dismissed.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.267
You can speak honestly, Lieutenant Powers.
You think I did anything wrong there?

07:16.436 --> 07:17.436
No, Colonel.

07:17.979 --> 07:21.643
He is an otherwise fine man
when he is sober.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.279
How's your wife, sir?

07:29.032 --> 07:30.989
She's good. Pregnant.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.446
Gonna give birth anytime soon.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.257
Hopefully, we'll get you home in time
to see the birth of your newest.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.164
One can certainly hope.

07:40.877 --> 07:41.877
You're free to go.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.835
- Thank you, Franklin.
- Yes, sir.

07:57.435 --> 08:02.100
<i>♪ Amazing Grace ♪</i>

08:02.607 --> 08:07.352
<i>♪ How sweet the sound ♪</i>

08:08.196 --> 08:13.863
<i>♪ That saved a wretch like me... ♪</i>

08:13.910 --> 08:15.242
Aw, this is awesome.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.829
Just like when we played Cowboys and Indians
with the kids back on the block.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.207
Now do me.

08:21.209 --> 08:24.793
Yeah, except you and your brother
never let me play the Indian.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.788
That's cos we were Italian.

08:28.550 --> 08:31.167
What the hell does that have to do
with anything, Carbone?

08:32.429 --> 08:34.842
I don't know. Indian? Italian?

08:35.390 --> 08:36.881
They both start with the letter "I".

08:37.600 --> 08:39.261
Irish begins with an "I" too.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.599
Yeah, it does, don't it?

08:42.981 --> 08:45.314
You're stupid!

08:45.817 --> 08:46.898
Right, hold still.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.818
Second Battalion, on your feet!

08:50.196 --> 08:51.687
Attention!

08:52.449 --> 08:53.656
Eyes forward!

09:00.081 --> 09:01.993
Gentlemen, at ease!

09:02.542 --> 09:03.749
Smoke one if you have one.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.631
Once we hit shallow water at 06:30 hours

09:11.885 --> 09:14.047
we will deploy in squads.

09:14.888 --> 09:18.757
We will scale those cliffs
and we will take out any machine gun nests.

09:19.851 --> 09:23.640
Then we will convene to clear out
a massive bunker on the ridge line.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.352
After the hill is cleared out,
we will search for the six cannons

09:27.442 --> 09:28.933
and we will destroy them.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.191
The Navy is gonna begin
bombardment of the shoreline.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.398
We will board the LCAs, we will have
a 60-minute traverse to the shore.

09:36.534 --> 09:39.618
Plenty of time to think about
the greater good

09:39.704 --> 09:40.990
and why you are here.

09:41.664 --> 09:42.745
Let me get a hoo-ah!

09:43.083 --> 09:44.199
Hoo-ah!

09:44.292 --> 09:46.830
The Nazi doesn't care about you!

09:46.920 --> 09:48.707
They question your intelligence.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.167
They think you are weak!

09:51.549 --> 09:53.256
Do you remember your training?

09:53.718 --> 09:54.925
Yes, sir!

09:55.970 --> 09:57.427
As some of you may have heard

09:58.890 --> 10:01.849
Major Lytle has been dismissed,
relieved of his duties.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.144
He was not 100% behind this mission.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.940
Therefore, I felt that
he would be a liability to you.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.691
I need men who believe in this mission.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.061
I need you to be 100%.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.068
And I want nothing more than our success

10:17.200 --> 10:20.534
and to return as many of you home
to your families as possible.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.786
Therefore, I will lead us into battle.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.409
Alright, get ready to board those LCAs!

10:28.837 --> 10:31.329
- Let me get a hoo-ah!
- Hoo-ah!

10:33.007 --> 10:34.123
Dismissed!

10:35.468 --> 10:38.211
Doesn't make any sense,
the major wouldn't be behind this mission.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.430
Doesn't make any sense at all.
He ain't a coward.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.425
There's gotta be a good reason behind it.

10:44.727 --> 10:48.016
I heard some of the fellas say the Frenchies
say these guns don't even exist.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.565
Germans are just using it as a trap
to pick us off, off those frickin' cliffs.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.194
Well, we're gonna find out.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.966
I'm gonna have a word with the colonel.

11:01.578 --> 11:02.864
- Colonel, if I may?
- Lommell?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.617
When did you dismiss the major, sir?

11:05.957 --> 11:08.269
About an hour ago, Lommell.
I know that you were fond of him.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.159
Is there an issue
that you'd like to discuss?

11:10.587 --> 11:11.587
No, sir, um...

11:11.838 --> 11:14.108
It's just strange that he wouldn't
follow through with the mission

11:14.132 --> 11:15.168
without good reason, sir.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.668
Are you aware that the major
is fond of Irish whiskey?

11:18.887 --> 11:19.887
Yes, sir.

11:20.555 --> 11:21.966
Well, there lies your answer.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.091
- Thank you, sir.
- Colonel, can I have a word, sir?

11:27.228 --> 11:29.595
Kuhn's got his head so far up
the lieutenant colonel's ass

11:29.647 --> 11:30.647
he's gonna suffocate.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.314
Lance, keep your voice down, man.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.100
Wanna demote you back to a private?

11:40.992 --> 11:45.157
Alright, 2nd Rangers, this is where
we're gonna go beyond ourselves.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.370
We are 40 minutes behind schedule.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.282
We're gonna be diverting
to the eastern side of the cliff.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.163
- Lommell?
- Yes, sir!

11:52.212 --> 11:53.578
You're gonna take A-Squad!

11:54.005 --> 11:55.291
- Powers?
- Yes, sir.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.672
You are gonna take B-Squad.

11:57.592 --> 11:58.799
Let me get a hoo-ah!

11:59.010 --> 12:00.171
Hoo-ah!

12:00.303 --> 12:02.420
Men, when that door opens,
you give 'em hell.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.931
I'm scared.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.315
Stay focused, Wiley.

12:15.652 --> 12:18.019
When that door opens up,
you give 'em hell.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.832
Fire on those ridges, boys.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.460
Go, go, go, go!

12:55.066 --> 12:56.066
Go!

12:58.319 --> 12:59.810
A-Squad, shoot on that ridge!

13:07.203 --> 13:08.614
On your feet, soldier!

13:12.125 --> 13:13.832
Move forward!

13:32.228 --> 13:34.140
Get those grapple hooks up there now!

13:34.314 --> 13:35.314
Fire in the hole!

13:43.614 --> 13:45.071
Move, move, move!

13:53.666 --> 13:54.624
You're alright!

13:54.625 --> 13:55.911
You're alright, come on!

14:11.809 --> 14:13.550
All soldiers to the wall!

14:20.318 --> 14:21.559
Return fire, to the top!

14:25.281 --> 14:26.362
Grenade!

14:28.576 --> 14:29.576
Return fire!

14:29.952 --> 14:30.952
Come on!

14:38.336 --> 14:40.043
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

14:41.464 --> 14:42.464
Keep moving!

14:52.350 --> 14:53.511
Get my leg!

14:56.396 --> 14:58.103
- Wiley!
- My leg!

15:00.191 --> 15:01.557
The... the leg's gone!

15:01.818 --> 15:04.129
I'm sorry, Tech Sergeant,
this is my... my first deployment.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.314
You better get used to it!

15:05.988 --> 15:08.749
He's not gonna make it, I want you
to give him something for the pain.

15:12.787 --> 15:13.787
Reloading!

15:13.871 --> 15:16.471
Can't get up the ropes,
I can't get up the ropes, they're too wet!

15:17.625 --> 15:18.741
Did you hear what I said?

15:18.793 --> 15:20.625
I can take it back, please, I can save him!

15:20.878 --> 15:23.211
Look around!
You can't make it back to the LCA!

15:25.591 --> 15:27.378
Give him something for the pain.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.396
No, all of it.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.437
All of it!

15:53.494 --> 15:55.110
You stay with him till he goes.

16:01.586 --> 16:02.586
Reload!

16:02.753 --> 16:04.369
Fire up on top of that line!

16:05.965 --> 16:07.422
Son of a bitch! This is a mess!

16:07.842 --> 16:09.549
Yeah, that's why we gotta get to the top!

16:09.635 --> 16:11.321
- Reloading!
- Climb up those ropes, boys!

16:11.345 --> 16:12.345
Get up there!

16:13.181 --> 16:15.138
Move! Get up there! Let's go!

16:16.100 --> 16:17.841
Stabilise yourselves! Get up there!

16:19.812 --> 16:21.428
Get up there, come on!

16:22.732 --> 16:23.768
Reloading!

16:26.277 --> 16:28.269
Get 'em up top, boys!
Hit 'em up top!

16:29.155 --> 16:30.155
Reloading!

16:32.575 --> 16:33.691
Grenade!

16:41.542 --> 16:43.158
Sir! Sir!

16:43.377 --> 16:44.977
Go, up, everybody, on your feet!

16:45.004 --> 16:46.370
We've got to return fire!

16:47.048 --> 16:48.048
Colonel.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.000
I'm pretty sure I can take my squad.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.550
We can scale up those rocks

16:52.637 --> 16:54.823
and we can secure the ridge
while I take care of those Krauts!

16:54.847 --> 16:56.567
You have my approval, First Sergeant. Move!

16:56.599 --> 16:57.635
Alright, thank you.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.595
Carbone! White! Hodges!

16:59.810 --> 17:00.926
You're with me! Let's go!

17:01.103 --> 17:02.103
Provide cover!

17:03.731 --> 17:05.893
Soldiers, follow me up to the route!

17:15.660 --> 17:16.660
Reloading!

17:17.869 --> 17:19.031
Grenade!

17:21.540 --> 17:23.578
That's another man down!
Four men down!

17:24.001 --> 17:25.037
Fire! Cover fire!

17:25.086 --> 17:27.499
Fire! Cover fire!
Fire! Cover fire!

17:27.672 --> 17:30.540
Make it up the ledge here,
you give them hell!

17:30.925 --> 17:32.041
Return fire!

17:33.302 --> 17:35.089
On top of the ridge!

17:57.493 --> 18:00.406
Hodges, use that BAR.
Put it to good use. Take 'em out.

18:00.788 --> 18:01.824
You got it, boss.

18:15.469 --> 18:16.469
On me!

18:30.610 --> 18:31.610
On me!

18:33.112 --> 18:34.112
Move!

18:34.989 --> 18:35.989
Cover!

18:45.374 --> 18:46.455
Reloading!

18:48.127 --> 18:49.127
Reload!

18:54.717 --> 18:56.003
Get back up the ropes!

18:56.052 --> 18:57.612
Let's go, boys!
Your lives depend on it!

18:57.637 --> 18:59.799
Go, go, get up the ropes, steady yourselves!

18:59.889 --> 19:01.505
Steady yourselves! Get on the ropes!

19:23.079 --> 19:24.079
Carbone?

19:24.372 --> 19:26.364
Sniper. My one o'clock.

19:27.041 --> 19:27.999
Take him out.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.868
You got it.
That fathead Jerry's as good as dead, Sarge!

19:31.253 --> 19:32.253
Get it done.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.755
Target down.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.837
I need to reload!

19:57.363 --> 19:58.843
Come on, boys! Give 'em hell!

20:02.493 --> 20:03.493
Grenade!

20:08.791 --> 20:10.783
Hodges, spray into 'em.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.098
Aah!

20:25.266 --> 20:26.266
- You get him?
- Think so.

20:26.809 --> 20:27.809
We're good.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.301
- Good job.
- Good job!

20:30.980 --> 20:32.721
Let's get the rest of the platoon up here.

21:00.968 --> 21:01.968
Carbone!

21:02.136 --> 21:04.128
- Yeah, Sarge?
- Show the colours.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.258
My pleasure, Sarge!

21:12.271 --> 21:14.513
Ridge line secure on my position!

21:14.899 --> 21:17.482
I say again,
ridge line secure on my position!

21:19.820 --> 21:20.936
Woo!

21:21.405 --> 21:23.567
- Boys, let me get a hoo-ah!
- Hoo-ah!

21:24.408 --> 21:26.866
The ridge line...

21:27.578 --> 21:30.195
The ridge line has been secured.
Let's get a hoo-rah!

21:30.289 --> 21:31.405
Hoo-ah!

21:31.582 --> 21:32.914
Get up those ropes!

21:34.752 --> 21:37.244
These colours don't run! Ha-ha!

21:45.429 --> 21:47.045
Keep your eyes open, boys.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.555
Sleep tight, Jerry motherfuckers.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.633
Red, white and blue.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.521
Welcome to the ridge, sir.

22:11.121 --> 22:13.579
Good job, First Sergeant!
Ridge line is secure.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.828
Gentlemen,
that's where we'll find the guns.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.292
That's what we need to take out.

22:19.088 --> 22:20.750
Enemy fire!

22:23.300 --> 22:25.166
- Got eyes on 'em!
- Nothing!

22:30.057 --> 22:31.298
Twelve o'clock! Return fire!

22:34.228 --> 22:35.719
Hodges, lay down some fire!

22:40.025 --> 22:41.061
I got him!

22:41.110 --> 22:43.030
Wiley, get it together! The colonel's hit!

22:43.195 --> 22:45.195
Pull yourself together, Wiley.
It's not a big deal.

22:45.281 --> 22:46.591
I still have to wrap it for infection.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.844
Alright, just make it quick.
Time is of the essence, son.

22:48.868 --> 22:49.949
Ninety seconds!

22:51.036 --> 22:52.036
I'm counting.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.331
Son of a bitch!

22:56.709 --> 22:58.200
So they want to be savage.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.605
Well, that just means, gentlemen

23:00.629 --> 23:03.588
that we're gonna have to show them
the next evolution of savage!

23:04.550 --> 23:06.633
- We get a hoo-ah?
- Hoo-ah!

23:07.803 --> 23:08.919
This is nothing!

23:14.143 --> 23:15.850
- Hurry up, Wiley.
- We're good.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.017
Thank you, son.

23:19.023 --> 23:20.983
- Sure you're alright, Colonel?
- I'll be alright.

23:21.317 --> 23:22.317
Orders, sir?

23:24.862 --> 23:27.946
We move to the bunkers.
Prepare for another engagement.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.119
You heard the man, move out.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.539
Yes, Sergeant.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.533
We show them hell beyond the confines
of their imagination.

23:41.211 --> 23:42.702
If we don't take these six guns

23:42.796 --> 23:45.254
our entire mission will sink
to the bottom of that ocean

23:45.382 --> 23:47.374
and 200,000 soldiers along with it.

23:49.053 --> 23:50.919
Colonel, we're approaching our target.

23:51.305 --> 23:53.638
OK, gentlemen.
Proceed with caution and purpose.

23:57.561 --> 23:58.847
These aren't the guns.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.855
- These are decoys.
- Jerries put telephone poles up.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.183
Stay alert until we have swept the bunker!

24:09.239 --> 24:10.946
Attack!

24:14.370 --> 24:15.370
Clear!

24:16.747 --> 24:17.863
There's no guns!

24:18.332 --> 24:21.093
You gotta be kidding me.
We lost half the company for nothing!

24:23.170 --> 24:25.162
- You alright, sir?
- Yes, I'm fine, thank you.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.714
Form a defence around that perimeter
while we regroup!

24:27.925 --> 24:28.925
Yes, sir.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.101
Gentlemen, we need to find those guns.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.549
Alright, gather around, men.

24:38.352 --> 24:42.517
Alright, we're receiving fire
from the east-facing sea battery.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.975
Over that hill,
the east and west emplacements.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.729
We're divided in two teams.

24:47.945 --> 24:50.062
One takes the east, one takes the west.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.384
Lieutenant Powers and I
are gonna focus on the front.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.240
There's been a lot of friendly fire
out there.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.985
There have been a lot of casualties.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.705
If you want to come home,
you defend your brother.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.165
I want blood! Do you hear me?

25:03.252 --> 25:04.252
Yes, sir!

25:04.253 --> 25:05.835
Alright, there, you have your orders!

25:06.171 --> 25:07.753
Alright, White, you're with me.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.132
We hit the west.

25:09.299 --> 25:12.508
Kuhn? You take Carbone and Hodges,
you hit the east.

25:12.720 --> 25:13.756
- Got it.
- Let's move!

25:14.138 --> 25:15.470
Yes, First Sergeant!

25:23.439 --> 25:25.271
Twelve o'clock, Germans, left side!

25:29.194 --> 25:31.060
Take my six. I'm gonna frag 'em.

25:38.162 --> 25:39.573
Present from Uncle Sam!

25:54.595 --> 25:56.086
Come on, we're clear!

26:08.776 --> 26:10.608
- Clear.
- Clear.

26:15.449 --> 26:16.485
We got a map.

26:26.877 --> 26:27.877
White?

26:28.295 --> 26:29.375
Let's give these to Rudder.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.130
Move.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.967
Advance!

26:37.346 --> 26:39.008
Move, move, move, move!

26:59.785 --> 27:02.118
Find cover! Take cover!

27:03.580 --> 27:04.616
Get down!

27:13.090 --> 27:14.297
Cover, cover!

27:17.261 --> 27:18.261
Fire!

27:29.731 --> 27:31.393
- Wiley, go check on him!
- OK.

27:34.194 --> 27:35.275
Breathing?

27:35.696 --> 27:36.696
Negative.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.345
Powers! Grenade!

28:09.146 --> 28:10.146
Clear!

28:10.564 --> 28:11.600
Advance!

28:12.941 --> 28:14.648
Go! Advance!

28:40.427 --> 28:42.760
Carbone! Use your grenade, we'll cover you.

28:52.606 --> 28:53.606
Move!

29:15.295 --> 29:16.536
Fucking got 'em!

29:18.423 --> 29:21.543
- Got 'em on the line yet, Robbins?
- No, sir, not yet, sir. I'm working on it.

29:23.178 --> 29:24.464
Sir, I have the general.

29:26.556 --> 29:27.556
Hammer?

29:28.642 --> 29:29.642
This is Anvil.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.721
Anvil, report.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.542
<i>The guns aren't here.</i>

29:33.939 --> 29:35.521
<i>We're gonna need more time.</i>

29:35.941 --> 29:37.307
The ridge line is not secured.

29:37.901 --> 29:40.644
I repeat, the ridge line's not secured.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.276
Recommend Tilt.

29:45.867 --> 29:46.867
Copy, Anvil.

29:48.328 --> 29:51.446
<i>General Bradley, we will find those guns.</i>

29:51.999 --> 29:52.999
Anvil out.

29:56.503 --> 29:58.085
Get me Lieutenant Colonel Schneider.

30:03.385 --> 30:04.466
This is General Bradley.

30:04.803 --> 30:09.343
I need you to divert the 5th Ranger Battalion
to Omaha Beach. Affirmative.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.432
Any word from Dog Company?

30:20.444 --> 30:22.527
Sir, they're taking
substantial casualties, sir.

30:23.739 --> 30:25.355
Colonel Rudder just called Tilt, sir.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.034
Damn it.

30:29.619 --> 30:31.781
This the intel for Operation Overlord?

30:31.997 --> 30:33.033
Yes, sir.

30:47.888 --> 30:50.596
We're gonna keep the same MO for the bunker.
Seemed to work well.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.558
We're gonna traverse
down the terrain from the rear.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.347
And Lieutenant Powers and I

30:56.688 --> 30:59.396
will again lead the remaining company
on a full assault.

31:02.903 --> 31:03.939
First Sergeant.

31:04.404 --> 31:07.272
You and Mr White will flank to the left

31:08.325 --> 31:10.442
and enter the east-side tunnel entrance.

31:10.994 --> 31:12.610
- Yes, sir.
- Staff Sergeant?

31:12.954 --> 31:15.116
You, Hodges and Carbone

31:16.124 --> 31:18.491
enter the west-side tunnel entrance.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.835
- You will flank to the right.
- Yes, sir.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.252
Clear out the bunker.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.711
Blow the ideology
out the back of their heads.

31:25.759 --> 31:27.751
You guys keep yourselves together in there.

31:28.887 --> 31:32.176
Now, if we are in fact
finished clearing off topside

31:32.724 --> 31:34.636
we will come down to assist.

31:35.936 --> 31:37.222
Everybody good with that plan?

31:37.396 --> 31:38.557
Hoo-ah!

31:38.688 --> 31:41.146
- Let me hear that again!
- Hoo-ah!

31:43.568 --> 31:46.231
You good with that plan,
Technical Sergeant White?

31:47.155 --> 31:48.521
- Yes, sir.
- Well, good.

31:49.032 --> 31:50.193
Back to battle then!

32:32.492 --> 32:33.492
Cover me.

33:05.859 --> 33:06.859
Check it out.

33:11.615 --> 33:12.615
Anything?

33:13.867 --> 33:14.867
Clear.

33:15.452 --> 33:17.812
Toss a grenade in there.
Let's blow this equipment.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.103
Clear.

34:25.272 --> 34:26.853
What the hell is that stacked up here?

34:41.079 --> 34:42.695
- Flash!
- Thunder!

34:43.331 --> 34:45.493
It's us, Lommell and White.

34:53.757 --> 34:56.078
- You guys good on the east?
- Yeah, we're all clear.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.088
Does the colonel's map show
these tunnels intersecting?

34:59.723 --> 35:00.884
Not that I recall.

35:04.686 --> 35:06.177
That's a lot of ammunition.

35:06.813 --> 35:08.224
I think we should blow this joint.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.602
Yeah. Let's bury it.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.479
We need to give Rudder our support.

35:13.987 --> 35:16.104
Let's continue forward, alright?

35:17.032 --> 35:19.445
Let's keep moving, finish our sweep.
Alright, boys?

35:19.492 --> 35:20.778
- Hell yeah.
- Let's go.

36:12.253 --> 36:13.789
Drop your guns now!

36:16.299 --> 36:17.835
Drop your weapons!

36:17.926 --> 36:19.792
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!

36:20.595 --> 36:21.595
Drop 'em!

36:23.598 --> 36:24.634
Get down!

36:24.766 --> 36:25.766
OK, OK, stop!

36:26.935 --> 36:27.935
Drop your weapons.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.273
Drop it.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.061
Put it down!

36:36.653 --> 36:38.861
Round 'em up. I want interrogations.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.820
Everyone with a swastika
on their arm is to be on the ground.

36:55.714 --> 36:56.714
Wiley?

36:58.174 --> 37:01.463
Line 'em up in the middle! Come on, let's go!
This is America now, 2nd Battalion!

37:01.553 --> 37:03.089
Check out his leg.

37:03.805 --> 37:05.216
I said, check out his leg.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.952
- Alright, alright, alright.
- He's not gonna bite ya, Wiley.

37:07.976 --> 37:08.976
Hey, hey.

37:09.144 --> 37:10.225
Hey, hey! Ha! Ha!

37:13.064 --> 37:14.430
I'm Wiley, OK?

37:14.941 --> 37:16.022
My name is Wiley.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.689
Name? What's your name?

37:20.321 --> 37:21.357
- Horst.
- Horst.

37:21.531 --> 37:25.115
OK, Horst,
I'm gonna check out your leg, OK?

37:28.705 --> 37:31.072
Do you hear that, boys?
What you think of that ideology?

37:32.041 --> 37:33.373
I know you're loaded with some.

37:35.003 --> 37:38.542
Lommell. Find anything of any significance,
First Sergeant?

37:38.965 --> 37:39.882
No.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.090
Nothing of significance, sir.

37:42.218 --> 37:45.677
Stockpiles of munitions,
radio room, rations, the lot.

37:46.347 --> 37:47.700
We took care of the equipment room.

37:47.724 --> 37:49.684
Nothing about the whereabouts
of the guns, though?

37:50.727 --> 37:51.763
No intel, sir.

37:52.145 --> 37:53.145
Strange.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.103
I thought we'd find something, myself

37:55.982 --> 37:58.144
and we especially didn't come across
any resistance

37:58.485 --> 38:00.588
with this division to be guarding something
like that artillery.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.612
Agreed.

38:02.197 --> 38:05.065
- Thoughts on the whereabouts of the guns?
- If they even exist.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.929
They'd have to be somewhere in this area
if they wanna defend the beach with them.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.570
Alright. Well, the answer probably lies
with one of them.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.747
- Staff Sergeant!
- Yes, sir?

38:14.334 --> 38:15.791
Your German's quite good.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.876
Speak to the corporal in Deutsch!

38:20.840 --> 38:22.456
Hey, look at me.

38:23.885 --> 38:24.921
Where are the guns?

38:29.140 --> 38:30.140
Hm?

38:30.517 --> 38:31.553
Look at me!

38:50.703 --> 38:52.820
Technical Sergeant White!

38:54.040 --> 38:55.156
That is a warning!

38:56.835 --> 38:59.498
Somebody give me a canteen
and some food rations, now!

38:59.754 --> 39:00.754
I'm out, Kuhn.

39:01.381 --> 39:02.381
I'm out.

39:12.392 --> 39:13.599
Keep doing what you're doing.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.431
Robbins! Get Hammer on the line.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.207
- Yes, sir.
- Need to relay some information.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.020
- I have him ready, sir!
- Thank you, Robbins.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.066
Hammer, this is Anvil.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.362
We have secured the ridge line
and there are no guns.

39:34.664 --> 39:37.327
I repeat, we have secured the ridge line.

39:37.417 --> 39:38.453
There are no guns.

39:39.002 --> 39:41.313
- We are conducting interrogations.
<i>- Copy.</i>

39:41.337 --> 39:42.828
The ridge line has been secured.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.998
Proceed with mission objective
based on new intel.

39:47.552 --> 39:48.552
Look at me!

39:50.555 --> 39:51.555
This isn't working.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.057
Time for another tactic, Kuhn.

40:03.109 --> 40:05.977
Listen to me, I'm the one dealing with this.
You got that?

40:07.405 --> 40:08.816
Let me deal with it.

40:14.996 --> 40:15.996
Understood.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.326
Keep me apprised, Anvil. Hammer out.

40:18.833 --> 40:19.949
<i>Anvil out.</i>

40:22.670 --> 40:23.751
Thank you, Robbins.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.427
We weren't gonna hurt him!
Why'd he do that?

40:41.105 --> 40:42.767
Why? Why?

40:45.860 --> 40:47.192
Alright, right-right-right...

40:50.782 --> 40:51.898
Ready?

40:56.913 --> 40:57.994
White!

40:59.624 --> 41:02.394
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get the rifle out of his goddamn face!

41:02.418 --> 41:04.375
You've already been demoted
to a lesser rank!

41:04.462 --> 41:07.330
You keep on running into situations
with misconduct!

41:07.882 --> 41:10.420
Do not test me
or you will be in front of a court-martial!

41:12.053 --> 41:13.053
Control yourself!

41:21.562 --> 41:24.002
What is he saying?
Do you understand what he's saying?

41:24.732 --> 41:25.813
Tell us where!

41:25.942 --> 41:29.356
I don't know how long I can keep my men
from putting a bullet in your head!

41:43.334 --> 41:45.041
- He says...
- Do you understand this?

41:45.086 --> 41:49.581
Yeah, yeah. He's saying it's about
2.5 kilometres south of here in a barn.

41:50.883 --> 41:53.296
OK, understood, Staff Sergeant.
Thank you, Staff Sergeant.

41:55.555 --> 41:56.841
You say there are munitions?

41:57.598 --> 41:59.214
Yes, sir, in the bunker.

41:59.726 --> 42:00.842
Go rig some explosives.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.926
I wanna blow this place. I don't like it.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.228
- Can I get a hoo-rah?
- Hoo-ah!

42:05.732 --> 42:06.732
Alright!

42:07.775 --> 42:09.266
I'm gonna let Lommell handle this.

42:09.485 --> 42:11.943
Before this, I wanna tell you
I just spoke to Command.

42:13.031 --> 42:16.775
There is yet again another German company
waiting for us on foot!

42:17.785 --> 42:21.199
Do you understand that this means you need
to brace yourself for another engagement?

42:23.041 --> 42:24.077
Alright.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.079
Rangers, lead the way!

42:27.670 --> 42:29.536
Lommell, handle it. Blow it!

42:31.549 --> 42:33.256
Alright, boys. You heard the man.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.376
We're moving on to find those guns.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.173
Obviously, they ain't here.

42:38.556 --> 42:41.924
Check your magazines, make sure you got
fresh magazines for your rifles.

42:42.852 --> 42:44.263
Carbone, Hodges?

42:44.353 --> 42:45.514
- Sir!
- Sir.

42:46.314 --> 42:49.523
You boys'll go back in the bunker,
you rig those munitions.

42:50.068 --> 42:51.508
We're gonna blow this place to hell.

42:51.986 --> 42:53.352
Be our pleasure, Sarge.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.566
Alright, boys. Let's move out!

43:14.550 --> 43:16.166
We did that right, huh, Hodges?

43:16.427 --> 43:18.339
Yeah, we did.

43:27.814 --> 43:29.555
We're gonna regroup for a bit, men.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.066
Have some water, grab something to eat.

43:33.194 --> 43:36.358
Wanna take a rest,
let the man next to you do so.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.484
Just switch off, take ten minutes.

43:40.576 --> 43:42.863
We're still at war. Stay alert.

43:43.663 --> 43:45.529
- Can I get a hoo-ah?
- Hoo-ah!

43:50.503 --> 43:51.619
Let's clear the area.

43:57.802 --> 43:58.802
Clear.

44:00.596 --> 44:01.596
Clear.

44:04.350 --> 44:06.307
Sit down. On your asses.

44:09.313 --> 44:11.054
I say we shoot these Jerries.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.016
They're only gonna slow us down.

44:14.152 --> 44:16.189
Now you're talking my language, huh?

44:20.116 --> 44:21.152
Sergeant.

44:21.951 --> 44:23.738
- Who did that bandage for you?
- I did, sir.

44:24.036 --> 44:26.356
Please have Wiley take a look at that
and get it redressed.

44:27.123 --> 44:28.159
I'm fine, sir.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.874
That was not a suggestion, soldier.

44:31.586 --> 44:33.327
- Lommell?
- Yes, sir?

44:33.588 --> 44:35.524
Something's wrong with your boy.
Keep him in check.

44:35.548 --> 44:37.028
I'll have a word with him, thank you.

44:37.216 --> 44:39.629
Man, White has lost it, First Sergeant.

44:40.344 --> 44:42.584
Did you know he was capable
of doing something like that?

44:44.140 --> 44:45.756
First Sergeant, did you know

44:45.892 --> 44:49.101
that Technical Sergeant White
was capable of doing something like that?

44:49.604 --> 44:51.470
War changes people.

44:52.648 --> 44:53.648
What can I say?

44:53.941 --> 44:57.480
Well, so, that's how you're gonna play it?

45:00.698 --> 45:01.698
Tech Sergeant.

45:02.325 --> 45:04.282
Just wanted to tell you,
for what it's worth...

45:04.368 --> 45:05.368
Wiley!

45:05.703 --> 45:08.036
Me and most of the fellas

45:08.206 --> 45:10.038
- think you did the right thing.
- Wiley!

45:10.541 --> 45:14.956
I mean, that fathead Kuhn
wasn't gonna get nowhere with that Nazi.

45:15.296 --> 45:16.412
Bandage this for me.

45:16.839 --> 45:19.832
They don't just roll over
and squeal just like that.

45:19.926 --> 45:24.091
Nah. They're tough bastards.
I mean, if you had shot...

45:24.305 --> 45:25.386
Just dress over it.

45:25.681 --> 45:28.389
Sir, you've been shot by one
of those sons of bitches over there!

45:28.476 --> 45:30.263
I gotta clean it, I gotta disinfect it.

45:30.353 --> 45:31.913
- I gotta...
- Did you hear what I said?

45:32.230 --> 45:34.267
Dress over it
and get the colonel off my ass.

45:36.025 --> 45:37.357
You see, I think you knew.

45:38.194 --> 45:40.561
You knew and you didn't do
anything about it

45:40.947 --> 45:42.813
which makes you just as guilty.

45:43.449 --> 45:45.315
That is enough, Staff Sergeant.

45:46.285 --> 45:47.285
Sit down.

45:49.413 --> 45:50.413
Now.

45:55.878 --> 45:58.541
If you had shot that Jerry corporal

45:58.673 --> 46:01.086
he would've just been a martyr,
dying for Deutschland.

46:02.969 --> 46:05.882
But, nah, you shot his buddy,
and that was a smart thing to do.

46:06.264 --> 46:08.847
Oh, he was scared as hell after that.

46:09.767 --> 46:10.767
Wiley...

46:11.686 --> 46:15.305
Ah! He couldn't help but spilling his guts
like there's no tomorrow.

46:18.276 --> 46:19.357
But, um, uh...

46:20.653 --> 46:23.145
You think the colonel was serious
about the court-martialling

46:23.197 --> 46:24.313
- for sure...
- Carbone!

46:26.617 --> 46:27.858
Get the hell away from me.

46:29.161 --> 46:30.161
Hey.

46:31.622 --> 46:32.622
Jeez.

46:37.753 --> 46:39.369
I'll be. Look at that.

46:39.547 --> 46:40.663
Hodges, check this.

46:40.798 --> 46:43.791
He looks just like the German Shepherd
I had when I was a kid.

46:44.510 --> 46:45.842
That ain't your Shepherd, pal.

46:46.721 --> 46:48.212
That looks like a Nazi dog to me.

46:49.640 --> 46:50.676
Come here, boy.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.262
You're asking to get your hand torn off.

46:53.978 --> 46:55.094
Nah.

46:55.980 --> 46:57.687
He's a sweetheart. I can tell.

46:59.358 --> 47:00.519
Ah, I hate dogs.

47:01.277 --> 47:02.768
Oh, not this one.

47:03.612 --> 47:04.773
Beautiful.

47:05.990 --> 47:06.990
He's gorgeous.

47:12.747 --> 47:13.747
Thanks.

47:44.236 --> 47:46.478
- Colonel?
- Robbins.

47:47.239 --> 47:48.946
It's Wiley, sir. I think he's losing it.

47:51.160 --> 47:52.276
I'll talk to him, son.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.073
Thank you, Robbins.

47:57.083 --> 47:58.083
Wiley?

48:00.086 --> 48:01.806
- Yes, sir?
- What's going on with you, son?

48:01.837 --> 48:04.797
It's come to my attention you're
no longer fit to be a part of this outfit.

48:05.007 --> 48:06.007
Why?

48:06.258 --> 48:08.466
Did I not dress Tech Sergeant's
wound correctly, sir?

48:08.719 --> 48:11.678
No, you did a fine job with that, son.
It's more about the...

48:15.726 --> 48:17.092
I understand your compassion.

48:18.521 --> 48:19.807
Listen, son, I...

48:22.691 --> 48:25.171
I remember my first day
of seeing combat like it was yesterday.

48:25.653 --> 48:26.769
It's not easy.

48:27.071 --> 48:29.859
Those images, the bad thoughts,
they'll never leave your mind.

48:29.907 --> 48:32.900
You'll never be able to forget them,
but every soldier's like that, son.

48:33.369 --> 48:34.405
Everybody's like that.

48:35.746 --> 48:37.533
Yes, sir. I'm fine.

48:38.499 --> 48:40.741
Son, you need to understand
that this is a part of it.

48:42.336 --> 48:46.000
This is a part of it, son,
and you will learn to bury it

48:46.841 --> 48:48.002
and turn it off

48:48.759 --> 48:49.966
change your reaction to it

48:50.845 --> 48:52.177
and disconnect...

48:53.389 --> 48:54.389
in time.

48:54.515 --> 48:57.428
And that really is the only way
you're gonna stay sane in war.

49:02.148 --> 49:04.060
How do you do that, sir?

49:04.567 --> 49:05.933
You focus on your job.

49:07.027 --> 49:08.234
And know that if you don't

49:08.279 --> 49:10.566
the very lives of the men around you
will be jeopardised.

49:13.409 --> 49:17.403
Those boys that gave their lives today
on the beach?

49:23.502 --> 49:25.789
Uh, that... that's on me, son, and, uh...

49:28.549 --> 49:32.133
if I choose to dwell on that, how could I
possibly continue to lead all of you?

49:32.344 --> 49:33.344
Right, son?

49:36.974 --> 49:39.512
I know you're taking lives and saving them.

49:41.437 --> 49:42.553
I understand you.

49:43.022 --> 49:44.022
I need you...

49:45.232 --> 49:46.723
to become a lion, yeah.

49:48.611 --> 49:51.945
- Just know that you're doing the right thing.
- Yes, sir. I can do this.

49:52.323 --> 49:54.235
Yes, you can.
You're trained for it too, son.

49:54.533 --> 49:55.865
Good talk. You carry on.

49:58.204 --> 49:59.945
Alright, men, let's move out!

50:02.833 --> 50:04.753
That's the voice of God, boys. Let's go!

50:24.939 --> 50:26.305
Hold your position, men!

50:29.193 --> 50:32.152
Lommell and White,
check out that structure to the left.

50:48.963 --> 50:49.963
Nothing here.

50:51.799 --> 50:52.880
The fire's fresh.

50:53.300 --> 50:54.461
Probably a refugee.

50:56.178 --> 50:58.090
- Hey!
- Do not... do not shoot.

50:58.347 --> 50:59.383
Come on out.

51:03.102 --> 51:04.343
Clear. Move in, move in.

51:09.984 --> 51:10.984
I am Nikolai.

51:13.028 --> 51:14.028
Polish.

51:14.863 --> 51:17.856
Fighting with the French Resistance.

51:20.661 --> 51:21.661
You are American, yes?

51:22.705 --> 51:24.037
- That's right.
- We're Americans.

51:25.165 --> 51:27.645
You say you're with the Resistance?
What're you doing out here?

51:29.044 --> 51:31.582
Fighting Nazis. Same as you, no?

51:34.717 --> 51:36.128
You are heading south?

51:39.054 --> 51:40.090
Maybe.

51:40.931 --> 51:43.093
Uh... you cannot go that way, my friends.

51:43.559 --> 51:45.050
Nazis, they come this way.

51:45.477 --> 51:48.060
They are... they are looking for me.

51:50.482 --> 51:51.643
They come from, um...

51:52.276 --> 51:54.484
headquarters, and just beyond...

51:55.404 --> 51:56.440
is the guns.

51:58.115 --> 51:59.276
What kind of guns?

52:00.909 --> 52:03.868
Like you say in America... big guns.

52:07.458 --> 52:08.574
Howitzers.

52:09.084 --> 52:10.620
How... how many Howitzers?

52:11.503 --> 52:13.369
I did not see them with my eyes.

52:13.922 --> 52:14.922
But...

52:16.091 --> 52:19.004
I met a man dying on a road

52:19.803 --> 52:21.840
with a 10-year-old boy...

52:22.848 --> 52:24.384
also killed by the Nazis.

52:24.933 --> 52:29.394
He sees them loading the Howitzers

52:29.480 --> 52:32.723
into a white plantation farmhouse.

52:33.400 --> 52:37.519
I believe him because I go to see
with my own eyes, and...

52:39.073 --> 52:41.941
there are many guards
all around the plantation.

52:43.869 --> 52:45.360
They are guarding something big.

52:46.580 --> 52:49.664
Sir, you're saying that this plantation
is in this direction over here?

52:50.584 --> 52:52.075
The headquarters are there.

52:52.670 --> 52:54.912
The plantation is around.

52:57.466 --> 52:59.549
Well, that's certainly contrary
to what our...

53:00.052 --> 53:01.839
Nazi corporal told us over here.

53:03.305 --> 53:08.016
It's almost as if the Nazi corporal
wanted to lead us into some sort of trap.

53:11.230 --> 53:12.666
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Hey, hey!

53:12.690 --> 53:13.771
- Hey! Lance!
- Hey!

53:14.274 --> 53:16.482
Do not kill him.
It's not gonna do a damn thing!

53:21.073 --> 53:24.066
Well, we heard our friend here.
Let's move out.

53:24.118 --> 53:25.404
Uh, Nikolai, was it?

53:25.911 --> 53:29.200
Do you need any rations, water,
medical attention?

53:29.498 --> 53:31.831
No. I could use a light.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Sir, he's been shot.

53:33.085 --> 53:35.730
Alright. Wiley, please come over here
for a second and check out that wound?

53:35.754 --> 53:37.086
- No, no...
- Sorry, sir, we...

53:38.632 --> 53:39.632
Just go. Hurry.

53:40.592 --> 53:41.592
You...

53:42.177 --> 53:47.297
You remember, you go east to avoid
the column of Nazis coming up this way.

53:47.766 --> 53:48.766
Go.

53:49.101 --> 53:50.101
Alright.

53:51.270 --> 53:52.270
Thank you, sir.

53:58.652 --> 53:59.938
Alright, let's move.

54:01.029 --> 54:02.029
Here you go, pal.

54:06.785 --> 54:09.698
The Yankees. Are they still the champions?

54:10.330 --> 54:13.368
Yeah, but the St. Louis Cardinals
are giving them a run for their money.

54:14.126 --> 54:18.040
Hey, Joe DiMaggio,
he will take them to victory, no?

54:18.922 --> 54:19.922
I hope so.

54:19.965 --> 54:21.765
First Sergeant, we are waiting on you.

54:23.051 --> 54:25.134
Thank you, Nikolai. You take care.

54:31.727 --> 54:34.765
- How you doing, Lommell?
- Good, sir, thank you.

54:34.980 --> 54:35.980
Colonel?

54:36.440 --> 54:37.647
Yes, Staff Sergeant?

54:40.444 --> 54:42.436
You know,
I think Nikolai was telling the truth.

54:43.405 --> 54:44.987
Look how deep these tracks are.

54:45.866 --> 54:47.653
Something heavy was trekked through here.

54:47.785 --> 54:50.072
Well, at last something's in our favour.

54:50.454 --> 54:51.490
Hoo-ah to that.

54:56.710 --> 54:58.042
Focke Wulf! Hit the deck!

54:58.128 --> 54:59.128
Oh, shit!

55:05.219 --> 55:06.300
Move, move, move!

55:10.349 --> 55:11.349
Making a pass.

55:19.983 --> 55:20.942
Halt!

55:20.943 --> 55:22.730
I'll put you down, son. You halt.

55:23.153 --> 55:25.520
A slight attitude adjustment.
Nothing over the top, son.

55:26.865 --> 55:28.322
Not before you, Jerry.

55:28.700 --> 55:30.737
<i>Arschloch.</i>

55:33.789 --> 55:35.325
Oh, <i>Scheiße!</i>

55:37.459 --> 55:38.700
<i>Besser, ja?</i>

55:41.004 --> 55:42.290
<i>Ja, alles gut.</i>

55:45.425 --> 55:48.008
We can expect company.
You can trust me on that.

55:48.762 --> 55:50.719
Keep your eyes peeled
and your weapons ready!

56:14.705 --> 56:15.741
Open fire!

56:15.998 --> 56:17.739
Fire at will! Fire at will!

56:21.420 --> 56:22.831
Use your instincts! Move out!

56:25.757 --> 56:27.498
Get down! Lay the Browning down!

56:27.676 --> 56:28.883
Hodges, lay the Browning down!

56:31.346 --> 56:32.882
Drop them down! End them!

56:56.705 --> 56:58.162
Grenade! Move back!

56:58.540 --> 56:59.701
White! No, no, no, no!

56:59.750 --> 57:00.786
No, White!

57:03.962 --> 57:04.962
Lance!

57:05.881 --> 57:06.881
Wiley!

57:10.260 --> 57:12.572
- Stay with me, man.
- They got Tech Sarge!

57:12.596 --> 57:14.053
They got Tech Sergeant!

57:27.402 --> 57:29.042
- Hang in there.
- OK, OK...

57:29.321 --> 57:30.521
Lance, just hang in there, OK?

57:31.448 --> 57:32.448
Lance?

57:32.658 --> 57:35.025
Not for nothing.

57:35.410 --> 57:37.180
- Lance, just hang in there, OK?
- Coming in with morphine.

57:37.204 --> 57:38.445
Wiley, come on.

57:38.789 --> 57:40.200
I got it, I got it, I got it.

57:40.415 --> 57:41.415
Lance!

57:42.834 --> 57:44.370
He's gone. He's gone!

57:44.461 --> 57:45.952
- No, no, White...
- He's gone!

57:48.715 --> 57:50.172
Come on, come on.

57:52.761 --> 57:55.424
Hodges! Carbone!
I need you inside the house!

57:55.555 --> 57:57.262
Everybody else, set up a perimeter!

57:57.557 --> 57:58.673
Yes, Colonel, sir!

58:21.873 --> 58:23.114
Aw, Lance.

58:25.043 --> 58:26.079
You idiot.

58:37.681 --> 58:39.092
Rest in peace, my friend.

59:07.753 --> 59:08.753
Sergeant?

59:23.977 --> 59:24.977
Listen...

59:26.897 --> 59:29.292
Even though I'll never agree
with what Tech Sergeant White did...

59:29.316 --> 59:31.182
- Not now, Kuhn.
- No, listen.

59:32.569 --> 59:33.685
I know he was your friend.

59:35.322 --> 59:36.322
I'm sorry.

59:38.950 --> 59:40.907
I'll always be honoured
to have served with him.

59:42.245 --> 59:43.986
He was otherwise a fine soldier.

59:48.502 --> 59:50.915
I served with him in another unit...

59:52.255 --> 59:53.416
about a year and a half ago.

59:56.176 --> 59:57.542
He was always kind of angry.

01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:01.504
I could always trust him

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.427
always had my back
no matter what was going on around us.

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:10.146
After that, he went off on some mission
he couldn't talk about

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.102
with the British Commandos.

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:19.355
When he got back,
he definitely wasn't the same.

01:00:21.535 --> 01:00:23.026
What happened? How'd he change?

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:28.874
Never asked.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:32.251
Maybe I should have.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:35.172
Nah.

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:37.423
You never should pry.

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:42.970
If somebody wants to talk,
they'll say something one way or another.

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.391
White was never one
to talk much about anything.

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.055
Maybe I just couldn't tell...

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:55.065
too focused on my own thoughts.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:57.860
Oh, hey, no, I think you're right.

01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:01.401
He was never one
to open up much about anything.

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:09.739
You don't seem to have a problem
talking about stuff.

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:11.417
Ha.

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:15.661
Or voicing your opinion, for that matter.

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:18.502
Is that a compliment or a criticism,
First Sergeant?

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:21.585
Neither. Just an observation, Kuhn.

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:25.846
You know, my old man,
he had this rule in the house. He, uh...

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:28.591
Well, he had a lot of rules.

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:31.594
But this one was like, you know,
you never went to bed angry.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.596
You never left the house angry.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:35.168
You always said
what you wanted to say cos...

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:37.232
Cos you never know
if you can see that person again?

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:38.402
Yeah, exactly.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.196
Yeah.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:42.484
My dad said the same thing.

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:45.150
- Maybe they knew each other.
- Well, maybe.

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:51.072
Bet you were the class president.
Valedictorian?

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:53.541
Something like that?

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:55.618
I got pretty good grades.

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:58.172
How about you, huh?

01:01:58.173 --> 01:02:00.290
I bet you were a real ladies' man.

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:03.509
Yeah, it was a problem.
White knew about that.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.055
Always chasing the girls.

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:11.601
What, you chasing them
or them chasing you? Huh?

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:15.187
The good ones always chased me,
so a little bit of both.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.035
- Oh.
- Except I always chased the bad ones.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:18.150
Yeah?

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:20.533
Well, I don't see how
that's much of a problem.

01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:23.496
It is when one of them turns out
to be married

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:25.397
and her husband
comes after you with a shotgun.

01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:27.692
Oh, wow, OK. For real?

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:30.579
Yep.

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:31.821
What happened?

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:34.911
I joined the Army.

01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:46.005
Alright, boys. Let's find those guns.

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:48.008
Colonel? Colonel!

01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:49.172
- Yeah?
- Found it!

01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:50.798
It looks like Nikolai wasn't lying.

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.057
There's a big map inside.

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:54.636
The guns are in a barn
about a half mile from here.

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:55.771
Perfect.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.764
Prepare to move out.

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:00.308
The enemy!

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:03.811
Move to cover! Keep your heads down!

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:14.158
Engage the enemy!

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:22.379
- Staff Sergeant!
- Yes, sir?

01:03:22.424 --> 01:03:26.509
I need you and Lommell to go find those guns.
We cannot fail this mission. Destroy them.

01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:28.051
Yes, sir! Move!

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.046
It's not in there, that's for sure.

01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:06.832
Alright, let's go look around back.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.010
Copy.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:23.273
Clear.

01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:27.735
Clear.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:32.618
This way.

01:04:58.395 --> 01:04:59.476
This looks like the place.

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:08.189
- Lay down fire!
- Reloading!

01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:18.622
Robbins?

01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:21.040
- Get Hammer on the line, son.
- Working on it, sir.

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:22.626
Shit!

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:28.674
Hammer.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.381
I've raised him, sir.

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:32.259
- Reloading!
- Good job.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:35.091
Hammer, this is Anvil.

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:36.473
Anvil, copy.

01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:38.848
Heavy reinforcements in superior numbers.

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:40.760
We are compromised.

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:44.430
I am requesting final protective fire
in our position.

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:48.233
Say again. You're requesting
final protective fire on your position?

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:49.547
<i>Affirmative, Hammer!</i>

01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:51.654
Requesting final protective fire
in our position!

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:54.315
There's no other recourse?

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:56.693
Hammer, there is no other form of recourse!

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:02.998
We are Charlie Foxtrot up here.
We are Charlie Foxtrot.

01:06:04.252 --> 01:06:05.368
Copy, Anvil.

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.420
Charlie Foxtrot, understood.

01:06:08.756 --> 01:06:11.123
Confirming final protective fire
on your position.

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:13.093
Will comply.

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:18.634
Godspeed, Anvil.

01:06:19.267 --> 01:06:20.383
Back at you, Hammer.

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:22.722
Alright, men.

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:24.909
I want you to listen to me very carefully.

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.306
I contacted Hammer.

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:30.568
We are gonna have final protective fire
sent to our position.

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:32.361
We will get through this.

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:34.442
You will see your wives again.

01:06:34.782 --> 01:06:36.239
We will survive this!

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:40.073
You will be going home,
so long as you understand

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:43.114
that you must give them hell!

01:06:43.374 --> 01:06:44.490
Hoo-rah!

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:46.951
Alright, keep your heads down.
Lay suppressive fire!

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:56.865
<i>Ben-My-Chree, this is Actual.</i>

01:06:58.598 --> 01:06:59.598
Stand by.

01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:01.515
Hammer on the line for you, sir.

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:05.811
This is Major Lytle here, sir.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.608
Final protective fire for Anvil's position.

01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:14.273
Roger, sir. Wilco.

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:17.280
Prepare the forward batteries
for engagement.

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:18.653
Aye, aye, sir.

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:25.907
Forward battery, load your weapons
and prepare to engage.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:29.414
I repeat, load your weapons
and prepare to engage.

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.221
How long until the artillery hits, sir?

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:03.452
Any second now, son.

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:07.705
- Carbone, cover me.
- Yes, sir, I got your back!

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:17.500
Robbins!

01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:23.555
Go, engage up there! Get those rounds off!

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:24.850
Open fire!

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.423
- Where do you need me?
- Think you can sight it?

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:36.920
- Yeah, I can do that.
- OK.

01:09:57.568 --> 01:09:59.525
Targeted! Ready to fire!

01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:01.071
Fire!

01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:09.153
Fuck!

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:14.583
Incoming!

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:16.452
Incoming!

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:18.753
Move, move, move!
Come on in! Come on in!

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:32.388
- Is that for us?
- It's gotta be.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:33.806
It's coming from offshore.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.030
Sounds like
it's going to Colonel's position.

01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:37.731
He's probably overrun.

01:10:38.025 --> 01:10:39.391
Called in last protective fire.

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:42.047
Let's get this done,
so our boys didn't die for nothing.

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.071
Copy that.

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:56.752
There's two of them.

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.086
Alright.

01:10:58.337 --> 01:10:59.398
You get the one on the left

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:00.862
- I get the one on the right.
- Copy.

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:08.963
- There's two more!
- Down!

01:11:15.146 --> 01:11:18.014
- Lay down some fire, I'll go round the side.
- Copy.

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:29.400
- Targeted! Ready to fire!
- Fire!

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:41.460
There's another one!

01:11:47.595 --> 01:11:48.961
Targeted! Ready to fire!

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:51.431
Fire!

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:02.312
Take that, Jerry!

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:10.615
Carbone, raise Hammer.

01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:23.124
- Hammer.
<i>- Hammer, this is Anvil.</i>

01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:26.207
I repeat, this is Anvil.
Cease loading and end mission.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.508
I repeat, cease loading and end mission.

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:29.678
<i>Aye, aye, Anvil.</i>

01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:31.003
Cease loading and end mission.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:33.301
Good to hear your voice.

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:35.390
Likewise.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:38.935
I will advise about the primary objective.

01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:40.599
Secondary objective is complete.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:43.311
I repeat, secondary mission is accomplished.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:44.812
Copy, Anvil.

01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:47.106
Good work. Keep us updated.

01:12:47.655 --> 01:12:49.442
Will do. Anvil out.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:53.028
When's it gonna end, sir?

01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:56.740
It is a necessary thing, son.
It'll end when it ends.

01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:04.043
Like blades of grass.
Don't be the fickle tree that snaps.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.380
Go with it.

01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:10.135
Fire!

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.007
Major Lytle!

01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:16.218
Hammer has commanded us to cease fire!

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.675
Cease fire! Cease fire!

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:27.095
The Germans are retreating!

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:31.153
They're on the retreat.

01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:37.865
Returning fire!

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:03.146
<i>Granate!</i>

01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:14.366
Lommell?

01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:15.659
I'm good! You good?

01:14:16.077 --> 01:14:17.077
Good!

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:41.012
Could've just jumped over the fence, Kuhn.

01:14:42.186 --> 01:14:43.768
Yeah, well... safety first.

01:14:44.855 --> 01:14:46.375
Looks like we hit the jackpot.

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:47.848
It's about time.

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:49.933
I got the thermites in my pack.

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:52.940
You take those, I'll take these.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:06.370
Grenade!

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:34.070
You OK?

01:15:34.488 --> 01:15:35.729
Let's try...

01:15:36.657 --> 01:15:37.818
I don't think I can walk.

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:40.692
Just stay put, OK?

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:48.700
Just stay put. Stay put, OK?
I'll take care of the cannons.

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:49.753
You just stay there.

01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:53.338
Take the thermites.
Put 'em in the recoil mechanism.

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:03.344
Damn bastard.

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:50.355
How's it going, Kuhn?

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:51.975
Give me a minute!

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:03.658
That's all five. I got all five.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:06.114
Come on. Help me up.

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:07.662
Yeah. You got an extra frag?

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:08.998
Yeah, why?

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:11.394
There's an ammo dump
over there I wanna blow.

01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:13.626
No, the cannons are priority.

01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:15.837
- Help me up.
- OK, OK.

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:16.965
Ah, easy...

01:17:17.424 --> 01:17:19.290
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

01:17:19.718 --> 01:17:20.718
Come on.

01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:23.549
Come on.

01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:25.972
I gotcha, I gotcha.

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:33.750
You know that black powder's
gonna blow like hell?

01:17:33.774 --> 01:17:34.774
Yeah.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:40.987
I'll be damned!

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.402
You think our boys got those cannons?

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:46.485
I don't know,
not unless there's an ammo dump.

01:17:46.579 --> 01:17:48.659
Thermite wouldn't explode like that.

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.684
It sounds like Hammer's
coming through the radio, Colonel.

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:51.708
Excellent.

01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:56.377
Thank you, Carbone.

01:17:58.966 --> 01:18:01.629
Copy that, Firestone. Glad to hear.

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:04.423
What is it, sir?

01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:06.087
There's a French company headed our way.

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:10.057
I have a big <i>merci beaucoup</i> to give them.

01:18:11.478 --> 01:18:12.639
- Wiley?
- Yes, sir?

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:15.514
You did a good job today, son, really.

01:18:15.816 --> 01:18:18.934
And a lot of those men out there,
they owe their lives to you.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:23.947
Wish I could have saved more, sir.

01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:26.695
You're doing it, son.

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:29.027
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:38.245
Ben-My-Chree, this is Actual.

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:43.134
Major Lytle?

01:18:44.136 --> 01:18:45.718
I have Anvil on the line for you, sir.

01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:54.437
James?

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:56.549
<i>James, you made it!</i>

01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:59.224
I apologise for the delay
in the artillery, sir.

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:01.609
I'm sorry, what're you talking about, Major?

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:03.715
We came under attack by enemy fire, sir.

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.981
Took out the turret crews.
That was me on the big guns.

01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:07.367
Thank you, Major.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.401
You saved us out there today.

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:11.361
Glad to have been able to help, sir.

01:19:11.455 --> 01:19:12.724
<i>You sure did, Cleveland.</i>

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:15.108
And I'll see you soon,
I'm sure you'll tell me all about it.

01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:16.376
Yes, sir.

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:26.719
Hey!

01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:29.884
It's Lommell and Kuhn!

01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:32.470
Hey, never been so happy
to see your ugly faces!

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.596
Don't get all mushy on me, Carbone!

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:35.645
Just put me here.

01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:36.887
Did you get the guns?

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:39.292
They won't be firing at us
any time soon, sir.

01:19:39.316 --> 01:19:41.228
You got that right.

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:44.023
Raise Hammer, please.

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:50.240
Thank you, Carbone.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:58.909
<i>Hammer, this is Anvil.</i>

01:19:59.586 --> 01:20:01.077
<i>Primary objective complete.</i>

01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:03.458
<i>I repeat, the primary objective is complete.</i>

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.716
Outstanding, Anvil. Outstanding!

01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:08.344
Oh, and, General...

01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:11.002
would it be possible for me
to get a word in with my wife?

01:20:11.432 --> 01:20:12.432
Of course, Colonel.

01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:14.261
Thank you, General. Anvil out.

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:21.689
- Wiley?
- Yes, sir?

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.358
- Go ahead and take care of Lommell, son.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:27.111
Come here, you gimp!

01:20:27.531 --> 01:20:28.942
Starting to feel the glory.

01:20:29.305 --> 01:20:35.221
