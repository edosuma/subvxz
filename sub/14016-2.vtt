Is this the place?

00:17.699 --> 00:19.500
You don't want to
go in there, honey.

00:19.566 --> 00:21.801

00:39.766 --> 00:41.400

FRANK: Oh, sweet Lord!
Hank, go call 91 1 .

00:58.265 --> 00:59.532
lt happened in there.

00:59.599 --> 01:01.000
Most of the customers split.

01:01.265 --> 01:03.133
Those we could grab,
we're holding inside.

01:03.199 --> 01:06.135
All right.
Keep them cozy.

clawed its way out.

01:11.132 --> 01:12.700
You want his wallet?

01:13.833 --> 01:17.403
Meet Tommy Bell,
NYU student.

01:18.532 --> 01:22.168
Well, l guess
he decided to see how
the other half lives.

01:22.232 --> 01:24.367
lt doesn't live very long.

01:24.432 --> 01:25.833
How do you want
to split this up?

01:25.966 --> 01:27.400
You want me to
work the street?

01:27.466 --> 01:29.768
What're you going to do?
Listen for echoes?

01:29.833 --> 01:32.135
No, come on,
Iet's go inside and see

01:32.265 --> 01:34.600
who was too fat,
stupid or lazy to get away.

01:36.733 --> 01:37.834
CURTIS: Another victim?

01:37.899 --> 01:40.001
SLATTERY: Passed out. Drunk.

01:40.065 --> 01:41.366
We have two blood trails.

01:41.432 --> 01:44.001
Big one to the front door,
some drops to the back.

01:44.065 --> 01:46.967
So either the victim
took a stroll in two
directions at once,

01:47.032 --> 01:50.435
or somebody else was
on the receiving
end of the weapon.

01:50.499 --> 01:53.101
Yo, innkeeper,
tell me a story.

01:53.165 --> 01:55.867
Missed it. l was
in the basement bringing
up a case of Jack.

01:55.933 --> 01:57.901
Yeah? l don't see any case.

01:59.299 --> 02:00.299
(GRUNTS)

02:00.699 --> 02:01.800
You see it now?

02:01.866 --> 02:02.900
What about you?

02:02.966 --> 02:04.634
l must've been
in the bathroom.

02:04.699 --> 02:06.233
You want to see
what l was bringing up?

02:06.299 --> 02:08.668
Oh! It rises!

02:08.733 --> 02:10.201
And where were you
during the fight?

02:10.264 --> 02:11.699
Been right here all night.

02:11.766 --> 02:13.467
CURTIS: Well, l guess
you saw everything then?

02:13.532 --> 02:14.699
l suppose.

02:14.766 --> 02:18.269
But l got a short-term
memory problem ever
since l fell on my head.

02:18.332 --> 02:20.434
So your memory will
come back if you
fell on it again?

02:20.499 --> 02:22.567
l don't think so.

02:22.632 --> 02:24.734
Hey, what do l got to do
to get another beer?

02:24.799 --> 02:26.834
lt's closing time.

02:26.899 --> 02:29.167
Go ahead. What're
they going to do?

02:29.232 --> 02:30.967
Call a cop?

03:22.099 --> 03:25.669
You ever eat the worm
at the bottom of
the mescal bottle?

03:29.199 --> 03:31.868
Last thing l remember,
l'm slurping that
pickled dirt sucker,

03:31.933 --> 03:34.335

with brain-bucket
Nazi headquarters.

03:34.399 --> 03:35.900
What's your name?

03:37.265 --> 03:38.666
They call me Mountain.

03:39.766 --> 03:41.834
That's your name?
Mountain?

03:41.899 --> 03:44.735
That's my last name.
First name's Rocky.

(LAUGHS)
He may get it figured out
by the time l retire.

03:54.299 --> 03:56.501
He wanted to go
one-on-one with King Kong.

03:56.566 --> 03:58.501
l think he thought
l had his back.

04:00.332 --> 04:01.499
So did you get anything?

04:01.566 --> 04:02.733
Anybody find
a murder weapon?

04:02.866 --> 04:05.969
CSU's still at the scene,
but l've got
another witness for you.

04:06.032 --> 04:09.101
Brought himself in,
and doesn't want to
be seen by these apes.

04:10.499 --> 04:12.434
l iust saw Cats and
then l was trying to find

04:12.499 --> 04:15.902

but l had to take a pee.

04:18.632 --> 04:21.567
Really?
So what happened?

04:21.632 --> 04:25.969
Well, l went into
the bar and l saw this boy,

04:26.032 --> 04:28.367
the one who was
stabbed, but before,

04:28.499 --> 04:30.834
and somebody was
yelling at him.

04:30.899 --> 04:33.134
Well, what did the person
doing the yelling look like?

04:33.199 --> 04:35.467
l kind of kept
my head down.

04:35.599 --> 04:37.867
l went right
to the bathroom.

04:37.933 --> 04:40.635
But when l came out,
the boy was bleeding,

04:40.699 --> 04:42.033
his girlfriend
was screaming.

04:42.099 --> 04:43.099
BRISCOE:
Whose girlfriend?

04:43.165 --> 04:44.666
The one who was stabbed.

04:44.966 --> 04:46.133
What did she look like?

04:46.499 --> 04:50.636
She was short, pretty,
her hair was in braids,

04:51.099 --> 04:52.467
yelling her head off.

04:55.599 --> 04:58.401
Did you get anything?
Amnesia victims with
blood on their boots.

04:58.933 --> 05:00.567
Well, we'll hold
the ones we can.

05:00.632 --> 05:02.834

05:14.499 --> 05:15.666

05:15.733 --> 05:18.202
We're iust beginning
our investigation,

05:18.265 --> 05:20.066
l'm very sorry
about your son.

05:20.132 --> 05:22.868
l've been to the morgue.
l saw his body.

05:22.933 --> 05:24.234
You ought to go home now.

05:24.299 --> 05:26.200
We'll call you tomorrow
if we have anything...

05:26.265 --> 05:27.666
l don't want to go home.

05:27.733 --> 05:29.768
lsn't there anything
that l can do to help?

05:30.666 --> 05:33.568
Mr. Bell, did your son
have a girlfriend?

05:34.065 --> 05:36.634
Short, hair in braids?

05:36.699 --> 05:38.167
She's involved?

05:38.232 --> 05:39.733
Well, who would
''she'' be, sir?

05:46.799 --> 05:48.867
Why he was
fooling around with...

05:49.399 --> 05:50.833
ls she pretty?

05:51.733 --> 05:53.568
l'm sure my son thought so.

Tommy last night.

l was going to call you,
but l didn't know anything.

06:09.232 --> 06:10.600
l didn't see anything.

06:10.666 --> 06:12.267
CURTIS: That's all right.
Just tell us what you can.

06:12.632 --> 06:14.500
What'd you and
Tommy do last night?

06:14.632 --> 06:16.533
He came by here.

06:16.599 --> 06:20.035
We were going to
go to a club, but he
wanted go to that bar

06:20.099 --> 06:22.034
to meet somebody
about buying a motorcycle.

06:22.099 --> 06:23.700
What'd you do
when you got there?

06:23.766 --> 06:25.501
Tommy went to the bar.

06:25.566 --> 06:27.701
l went to the ladies' room
and when l came out,

06:27.766 --> 06:30.568
all these people
were shouting and Tommy
was hurt bad,

06:30.632 --> 06:33.034
and l was scared,
so l just ran home
after Tommy was...

06:33.099 --> 06:34.467
You missed
the whole thing?

06:34.532 --> 06:36.600
You didn't hear an argument?
You didn't see a fight?

06:36.666 --> 06:39.301
l told you, l was
in the ladies' room.

06:39.366 --> 06:42.135

in that club, Miss Montero?

along the wall
with the hubcaps.

the place pretty well.

You recognize
anybody in there?

06:51.766 --> 06:53.467
No.

06:53.532 --> 06:56.034
Tommy was the one
who wanted to go there.

06:56.099 --> 06:59.135
He was a college student,
but he liked to be
like a low person.

06:59.199 --> 07:02.502
From what we hear
maybe you helped !him
out in that department.

07:02.566 --> 07:04.601
From who?
Tommy's father?

take it easy,
all right?

upset right now.

boy from Park Avenue.

and a racist.

want to know what
happened, that's all.

She just said again
that she didn't see.

07:41.232 --> 07:42.566
A girl in a place like that,
she was scared.

07:42.632 --> 07:44.100
She probably didn't
want to see.

Hey, if she can
lie in one language,
she can lie in two.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.101
Oh, what,
she's lying now?

07:48.165 --> 07:50.066
Because a man
like Louis Bell
doesn't like her?

07:50.132 --> 07:53.502
Oh, she isn't? Just
because you and she
parleyed español?

08:00.132 --> 08:02.501
The blood trail
to the front door
was your victim's.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.668
The other trail
is an unknown.

Proving once again
that you can't be

08:06.299 --> 08:08.000
in two places
at the same time.

08:08.332 --> 08:11.568
Well, with something
like this in your belly,
you can't be anywhere at all.

08:11.632 --> 08:14.067
lt was in a trash can
about a block away
from the bar.

08:14.199 --> 08:15.233
No prints.

08:15.299 --> 08:16.366
What is it?

08:16.432 --> 08:17.633
lt's an oil can opener,

08:17.866 --> 08:19.300
from when oil came in cans.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.600
Yeah. With the guard cut off.

08:20.733 --> 08:22.000
What? Somebody carried
that as a weapon?

08:22.065 --> 08:24.167
lt's also a beer tool.

08:24.232 --> 08:27.068
Stick the point
in the top of the can,
pour it down.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.666
lt's great for chugging.

08:30.566 --> 08:32.134
You ever hear
of a beer bong?

08:32.265 --> 08:33.866
A what?

08:33.933 --> 08:35.200
The guys in my college
dorm used to punch a hole

08:35.265 --> 08:36.466
in the bottom of the can,

08:36.532 --> 08:39.101
pop the top,
shoot it down.

08:39.164 --> 08:41.433
Well, in my college dorm,

08:41.499 --> 08:44.201
which was
a place called Shorty's
on Second Avenue,

08:44.265 --> 08:47.167
we used to lower
a shot glass into a pint
and swallow.

08:47.232 --> 08:48.833
Called it a depth charge.

08:48.899 --> 08:50.367
Well, that sounds
pretty good, too.

08:50.432 --> 08:52.167
Maybe we ought to
try it sometime, huh?

08:53.733 --> 08:55.101
l mean...

08:55.799 --> 08:56.799
Never mind.

08:58.933 --> 09:00.234
Sorry.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.000
Sorry about what?

09:04.399 --> 09:05.633
Nothing.

09:10.065 --> 09:11.099
You checked me out.

09:11.632 --> 09:12.666
Come on.

09:14.499 --> 09:16.133
You checked me out!

09:20.099 --> 09:23.101
Yeah. When l got
assigned to you,
l checked you out.

09:23.165 --> 09:24.833
lt was the
Iogical thing to do.

09:27.032 --> 09:29.234
Well, as long
as it was logical.

09:29.299 --> 09:31.668
What'd you find out
about me?

09:31.933 --> 09:35.703
You were a good cop,
then you fell into a bottle.

09:35.766 --> 09:39.369
You climbed out again,
but the jury is still out.

09:39.432 --> 09:42.401
l see they don't teach tact
at the academy anymore.

09:42.466 --> 09:44.968
Must've replaced it
with multicultural studies.

09:46.966 --> 09:48.867
Well, l think we ought
to start to try to find out

09:48.933 --> 09:51.201
who Tommy Bell was
meeting last night.

09:51.265 --> 09:54.267
Unless you'd rather
continue investigating me.

10:00.466 --> 10:02.734
All l knew is he was
going to Caridad's.

10:04.599 --> 10:06.534
Two phones? What?

10:06.599 --> 10:08.667
Roommates get
an extra line nowadays?

10:08.933 --> 10:11.368
Three. Tommy had
one for his modem.

10:11.466 --> 10:12.834
You mind if l
play around with it?

10:12.899 --> 10:15.101
l'm sure Tommy doesn't.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.267
Did Tommy get
any calls yesterday?

10:18.332 --> 10:20.534
Have any visitors?

10:20.599 --> 10:22.801
Just from his dad
for their monthly brawl.

10:22.866 --> 10:24.667
Brawl? What about?

10:24.733 --> 10:26.434
Tommy's lack of direction.

10:26.566 --> 10:28.267
Tommy's waste
of his talents.

10:28.332 --> 10:31.768
Tommy's poor
choice of friends,
me included.

10:31.833 --> 10:33.601
And Caridad?

10:33.666 --> 10:35.267
''That Puerto Rican slut,''

10:35.332 --> 10:37.467
Mr. Bell's
number one topic.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.901
Mr. Bell wanted Tommy
to marry Suzy Creamcheese

10:39.966 --> 10:41.534
and move to the suburbs.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.468
But Tommy preferred
the urban lifestyle?

10:44.733 --> 10:46.301
Said he was
serious this time.

10:46.366 --> 10:49.135
Either he dumped
Caridad and flew straight,
or that was it.

10:49.199 --> 10:52.035
No more money, no school,
get a job, the whole deal.

10:52.099 --> 10:53.300
And?

10:53.432 --> 10:54.666
Tommy said no way.

10:55.966 --> 10:58.802
Oh, yes, makes
a father's heart proud.

11:00.399 --> 11:01.700
Hey.

11:02.733 --> 11:05.469
Here's a list of
motorcycles for sale.

11:07.332 --> 11:10.968
Looks like a print-out
from an online download.
Hold on a second.

11:13.399 --> 11:15.067
CURTIS: Yeah, okay.
He's got a biker BBS

11:15.132 --> 11:16.933
in his telecom
address book here.

11:17.199 --> 11:18.967
Electronic want ads,
chat groups.

11:19.032 --> 11:21.033
Something called
''The New York Slimes:

11:21.099 --> 11:23.167
''your weekly review
of outlaw action.''

11:25.265 --> 11:26.899
''Last weekend some
guy named Stiletto

11:26.966 --> 11:30.035
''threw a garbage can
through a cop car
window in Port Jefferson.

11:30.099 --> 11:32.901
''Then he and his buddies
crotch-rocketed
down the center line.''

11:32.966 --> 11:34.167
We need all that?

11:34.232 --> 11:36.701
Tommy thoughtfully
printed out the ads
for us right here.

11:36.766 --> 11:37.933
No, he didn't print this.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.602
E-mail. 5:OO p.m., yesterday.

11:40.666 --> 11:44.603
''See you at
Strokers at 10:OO,
l'll bring my bike. Axel.''

11:44.666 --> 11:48.169
Axel. Oh, Axel's
phone number's right
here on the ad.

11:49.899 --> 11:53.869
They call me a rubber,
''rich, urban biker.''

11:53.933 --> 11:55.000
l've been riding Harleys

11:55.065 --> 11:57.901
since some of these outlaws
were on tricycles.

11:57.966 --> 12:00.134
How long you been
using the name ''Axel''?

12:00.199 --> 12:01.667
Since l was born.

12:01.733 --> 12:04.102
lt's been in my
mother's family
for generations.

12:04.165 --> 12:06.600
You made a date
to meet Thomas Bell
at Strokers, right?

12:06.666 --> 12:09.368
Yeah, l was letting go
of my '75 Sportster.

12:09.432 --> 12:11.100
Fifty-five hundred,
if you're Interested?

12:11.165 --> 12:12.432
Mr. Bell was.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.499
So what happened?

12:13.566 --> 12:14.566
He never saw it.

12:14.666 --> 12:18.770
He wasn't there by 10:30,
so l left for a midnight
supper, post-opera,

12:18.833 --> 12:20.401
with some friends
from Virginia.

12:20.766 --> 12:22.100
l was supposed to
go to the opera, too,

12:22.165 --> 12:24.634
but how many times
can you see Trístan?

12:24.699 --> 12:27.501
Yeah, l'm waiting
for the movie to
come out, myself.

12:27.566 --> 12:30.101
So you left at 10:30
for a midnight date?

12:30.165 --> 12:32.400
That must be
a pretty slow Sportster.

12:32.466 --> 12:34.134
Hardly, l would
have waited longer,

12:34.199 --> 12:37.035
but the mood at Strokers
turned unpleasant.

12:37.499 --> 12:39.534
A couple of Yankee
Rebels showed up.

12:39.599 --> 12:40.700
The biker gang?

12:40.766 --> 12:42.300
l believe they
call it a club.

12:42.833 --> 12:46.369
Anyway, they were
drinking heavily
and getting pretty frisky.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.433
Early withdrawal
seemed prudent.

12:57.132 --> 12:58.466
You think there's
a secret knock?

12:58.532 --> 13:00.000
Yeah. Hard.

13:03.966 --> 13:06.835
Well, Mr. Mountain.
Eat any worms lately?

13:06.899 --> 13:08.100
You got the wrong address.

13:08.232 --> 13:09.466
Yankee Rebels, right?

13:09.532 --> 13:11.367
Yeah, and l'm
sergeant-at-arms.

13:11.466 --> 13:13.668
Oh! Fellow officer.
How nice.

13:14.432 --> 13:18.235
What's this? Father-son day
at the Wonder Bread factory?

13:18.299 --> 13:19.466
They're cops, Igor.

13:19.532 --> 13:20.766
That's cute.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.667
We were just wondering
which of you fellows

13:22.733 --> 13:24.935
might've been at
Strokers last night.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.868
l stayed home to
watch the Ice Capades.

13:26.933 --> 13:28.768
How about you?

13:28.899 --> 13:30.734
l don't talk to spics
unless l'm drunk.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.434
Go ahead, l'm buying.

13:41.065 --> 13:43.400
l'll have a double bourbon
with a beer chaser.

13:43.466 --> 13:44.633
BRISCOE: All right,
now take it slow.

13:44.699 --> 13:47.068
Nice and slow. Rey.

13:49.966 --> 13:51.133
Rey!

14:07.566 --> 14:08.767
And what the hell
was that about?

14:08.899 --> 14:10.100
l thought it
was appropriate.

14:10.165 --> 14:11.366
For what? D-day?

14:11.432 --> 14:13.600
They pay us both to
use our best judgment,
that's what l did.

14:13.666 --> 14:15.200
Yeah? Well
your judgm'ent is
a little limited

14:15.265 --> 14:17.634
by the fact that you've
been on the street
about 15 minutes.

14:17.699 --> 14:20.268
Yeah, well, l know you
don't get any respect
unless you kick a little ass.

14:20.332 --> 14:21.800
l would've respected
the hell out of them

14:21.866 --> 14:24.168
if they'd have
kicked our asses,
which they almost did.

14:24.232 --> 14:25.766
What? You think
you talk your way
out of every jam?

14:25.833 --> 14:28.569
Hey, hey, hey!
There wasn't any jam

14:28.632 --> 14:31.668
until he called you a spic
and you pulled your gun.

14:31.733 --> 14:33.734
My goal, no iams.

14:38.833 --> 14:40.601
BRISCOE: Now what?
You drafting a complaint

14:40.666 --> 14:43.168
to the
Anti-Defamation League?

14:44.032 --> 14:48.136
Cellular modem. Remember
that review of outlaw
action on the BBS?

14:48.199 --> 14:49.767
Yeah.
Maybe whoever writes it

14:49.833 --> 14:52.502

to write about

spent the evening
in the ladies' room.

is going to happen
if l tell?

15:50.566 --> 15:52.801
What's going to happen
is we're going
to arrest the guys

15:52.866 --> 15:54.367
who killed your boyfriend.

15:54.432 --> 15:56.500

about Tommy? Huh?

Don't you feel
anything for him?

16:02.065 --> 16:04.734
Don't you want
to get the people
that did this to him?

16:04.799 --> 16:05.933
He's a nice boy.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.334
l was thinking
of maybe spending

16:30.032 --> 16:31.400
Thank you.

16:33.399 --> 16:35.334
Maybe her ''ex-old

16:35.399 --> 16:37.567

into Strokers with
someone else.

16:37.632 --> 16:38.799

16:38.866 --> 16:40.634
No. She's not in
a real talkative mood.

Well, you want to find
out who a girl dated,
you ask other girls.

16:45.466 --> 16:48.302
l think Curtis
can handle this one.

if l ask you
a couple of questions?

17:05.766 --> 17:07.666
Do you know a girl
named Caridad Montero?

17:07.965 --> 17:09.733
She lives right up there.

17:09.799 --> 17:11.967
Well, we see her.

17:13.232 --> 17:16.367
Be careful, Rosa,
he's a policeman.

17:17.265 --> 17:20.501
You wouldn't dare
arrest a girl like me,
would you?

17:20.566 --> 17:22.000
Depends on what
you're carrying.

17:22.065 --> 17:23.800
Caridad, what's
she carrying?

17:24.199 --> 17:27.234
l need to talk to the biker
she used to go out with.

17:27.299 --> 17:29.167
Well, you're gonna do
a séance or something,

17:29.232 --> 17:30.666
'cause that poor
boy was killed.

17:30.733 --> 17:32.434
No, not him.
The one before that.

17:32.499 --> 17:33.833
He was thin.

17:34.132 --> 17:36.968
Yeah.
He had a scar
on his face.

17:37.032 --> 17:38.733
Yeah.
He wore one
of those jackets.

17:39.666 --> 17:42.068
What'd it say on it?

17:42.132 --> 17:43.666
''Leather fools?''
Yeah.

17:43.733 --> 17:46.135
l don't know.
It had flags on it.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.034
Yeah, Caridad, she'd
wear that jacket, too.

17:48.099 --> 17:51.936
You know, like, she was
showing off or something.
Like we cared.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.601
With two flags?
Mmm-hmm.

to be swimming in it
for 20 or 30 years,

18:10.165 --> 18:11.499
so you better get used to it.

18:11.566 --> 18:14.535
What for? Hurt your
feelings when l called
you a spic?

18:17.332 --> 18:19.367
And l don't need my
gun any more, Igor.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.534
l got you in my
clubhouse now.

18:21.599 --> 18:24.201

you got some
pretty sorry members.

18:24.265 --> 18:26.800
Oh, but you're going to love
the secret handshake.

when l walk out of here.

isn't it?

attention, Igor.

18:35.466 --> 18:38.302
There were two
Yankee Rebels in that bar.

18:38.366 --> 18:42.636
You are a Yankee Rebel
and you used to go
out with Caridad,

18:42.699 --> 18:45.134
and Caridad's new
boyfriend winds up dead.

18:45.199 --> 18:46.300
(LAUGHING) Oh, man.

18:46.366 --> 18:47.400
BRISCOE: You know,
it's funny

18:47.466 --> 18:49.901
'cause you don't
Iook like the jealous
type to me.

18:49.966 --> 18:52.935
Jealous? Over that bitch?
You got to be kidding.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.801
You know, l bet
she made you
feel about that big

18:54.866 --> 18:56.133
when she walked
on you, right?

18:56.199 --> 18:58.100
She didn't walk,
l pushed her.

18:58.165 --> 19:00.467
After l passed her around
to a few of the guys.

19:02.199 --> 19:03.967
She pulled
the whole train, man.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.534
After that,
we don't touch them.

19:11.866 --> 19:13.067
We can't hold Igor.

19:13.132 --> 19:14.399
We're still going
to need a witness.

19:14.566 --> 19:16.601
Did Curtis try to
shoot him again?

19:17.366 --> 19:18.767
Robocop?

19:18.833 --> 19:23.370
He's busy sending
electronic mail to
Mr. New York Slimes.

19:23.432 --> 19:24.766
Thinks he can
draw him out.

19:24.833 --> 19:26.134
What do you think?

19:26.199 --> 19:29.669

once, lost 27 straight
games of solitaire.

you want to do now?

19:36.332 --> 19:38.801
How about talking to
somebody we can actually
Iook in the eye?

19:38.866 --> 19:39.900
Fine.

19:39.966 --> 19:41.233
l'll iust freshen up.

19:45.899 --> 19:47.634
He doesn't like me,
does he?

19:51.299 --> 19:53.434
l told you,
l was in the basement.

19:53.499 --> 19:55.767
BRISCOE: Yeah, when
the kid was being killed.

19:55.833 --> 19:56.967
How about before?

19:57.032 --> 19:58.566
Then l wasn't
in the basement.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.166
Very funny.
You know, l could have

20:00.232 --> 20:01.967
the yellow tape
put back up outside

20:02.032 --> 20:04.300
and close you down
for about a week.

20:04.366 --> 20:07.035
Look, the kid stood there
and he had a beer.

20:07.099 --> 20:09.835
Oh, yeah? Well,
who stood right here, then?

20:09.899 --> 20:11.533
People were coming
and going.

20:11.599 --> 20:13.334
A guy named Igor,
did he come or go?

20:13.532 --> 20:15.200
He was around.

20:15.265 --> 20:16.532
Well, how'd he react
when he saw

20:16.599 --> 20:18.968
his ex-old lady walk in
with this college kid?

20:19.032 --> 20:20.633
lf he saw them,
l doubt he noticed.

20:20.699 --> 20:22.233
Why is that?
Is he blind?

20:24.399 --> 20:26.033
She's used goods.

20:26.099 --> 20:30.570
The Rebels had a little
party with her one night,
and since then...

20:30.632 --> 20:34.135
l did her myself once,
behind the bar, and Igor
didn't even look up.

20:35.532 --> 20:38.001
Well, l guess we can shelve
the jealousy theory.

20:38.065 --> 20:39.933
You think you're
going to find a new
one in there?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.969
Maybe. E-mail from
Mr. New York Slimes.

20:43.032 --> 20:44.700
And?
You want to look
him in the eye?

20:44.766 --> 20:46.634
He says he'll meet
tonight at his place.

20:46.766 --> 20:48.667
He's got a great view.

be a squatter.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.302
or on a television newscast?

27:53.366 --> 27:55.968
No. The proper question is
not where they appeared,

27:56.032 --> 27:58.267
but what function
they served.

27:58.332 --> 28:01.601

28:26.132 --> 28:28.167
l'm afraid there are
no such courses.

So it's journalism,
but your own institution

28:30.299 --> 28:32.367

recognize it as such?

28:32.733 --> 28:34.601
FARNSWORTH:
Well, no, it's new.

28:34.666 --> 28:36.200
When television started,

28:36.265 --> 28:40.202
print iournalists
didn't think those reporters
were real reporters either.

28:40.265 --> 28:41.966
So, many journalists
today would not

28:42.032 --> 28:44.000
recognize Mr. Stillman
as a reporter?

or because he has brunch
with a city councilman?

31:29.332 --> 31:31.567
Are you going to bring me
something or aren't you?

31:31.632 --> 31:32.833
The girl is afraid.

31:32.899 --> 31:34.066
Then make her unafraid.

31:34.132 --> 31:35.633
Get her whatever she needs.

31:36.032 --> 31:37.266
ADAM: What about
your Phantom?

31:37.332 --> 31:39.534
Final arguments tomorrow.
It's up in the air.

31:39.599 --> 31:41.100
Well, bring it
down to Earth.

31:41.165 --> 31:42.966
Get me a name.
Make an arrest.

31:44.632 --> 31:47.768
l refer Your
_onor to In re: Dan,

31:47.833 --> 31:51.069
which the court
may find at 363,

31:51.199 --> 31:54.468
New York Sup 2nd, page 493.

31:54.532 --> 31:58.702
Even if Mr. Stillman
is a journalist

31:58.766 --> 32:00.501
entitled to
protect his sources,

32:00.566 --> 32:02.134
he's still
obligated to testify

32:02.199 --> 32:03.733
as to what he witnessed
with his own eyes.

32:03.799 --> 32:07.235
And he's obligated
to do nothing if he
witnessed nothing.

32:07.299 --> 32:09.167
The uncontroverted
evidence of his wound

32:09.232 --> 32:11.500
is that his back was
turned to the incident.

32:12.032 --> 32:14.434
Afterward, he spoke to people
that had been involved.

32:14.499 --> 32:15.566
They told him
what had happened,

32:15.632 --> 32:18.234
and at that point,
he was practicing
journalism.

32:18.299 --> 32:21.135
But the Press Shield
Law only applies

32:21.199 --> 32:22.400
if the people
interviewed know

32:22.466 --> 32:23.600
they're talking
to a reporter.

32:23.666 --> 32:26.902
ln this case, they most
likely thought they were
talking to some guy

32:26.966 --> 32:31.303
picking himself up
off the bar room floor
asking what happened.

32:31.366 --> 32:34.969
They had no expectation
of confidentiality
and so no protection.

32:35.032 --> 32:37.567
Okay, l've got your briefs.

32:37.632 --> 32:39.834
You'll have
my ruling soon.

32:44.499 --> 32:47.001
(WHISPERS) Jack,
the girlfriend went for
the full gift package.

32:47.065 --> 32:49.167
She's changed her mind.

32:49.232 --> 32:50.366
Good.

32:54.299 --> 32:56.601
We appreciate this,
Miss Montero.

32:56.666 --> 33:00.903
Well, when you said hotel,
l was thinking of
something a little nicer.

33:00.966 --> 33:03.101
We're limited
by our budget.

33:04.032 --> 33:06.100
We know you're
making a sacrifice.

33:06.866 --> 33:09.134
Well, it was time
for a change.

33:09.199 --> 33:11.568
You can pay for me
to get to Miami?
And get set up?

33:11.632 --> 33:13.100
lt's arranged.

33:13.966 --> 33:15.867
And nobody knows
where l am, right?

33:15.933 --> 33:17.934
Not unless you told them.

33:19.232 --> 33:22.101
JACK: We'd like to get
a statement from you now.

33:22.532 --> 33:23.532
(SIGHS)

33:23.733 --> 33:24.967
l know.

33:26.499 --> 33:28.167
l'll tell you everything.

33:33.466 --> 33:36.902
lt was this guy l was
hanging with. Igor.

33:36.966 --> 33:38.434
Yeah. The police
spoke to him.

33:38.532 --> 33:40.066
His real name is Danny.

33:40.199 --> 33:41.767
What happened?

33:41.833 --> 33:44.468
l walked in with Tommy
and Igor didn't like it.

33:45.466 --> 33:48.535
Well, he told the police
he wasn't jealous over you.

33:48.599 --> 33:50.000
ls that what he said?

33:51.432 --> 33:54.802
Well, maybe he was so drunk
he forgot he didn't care.

33:56.299 --> 33:58.801
She told the police
she was in the bathroom.

33:58.866 --> 34:01.835
She'll tell the grand
jury that she wasn't.

34:01.899 --> 34:04.735
And the killer
turns out to be
her ex-boyfriend,

34:04.799 --> 34:07.968
who dumped her by
passing her around
to his motorcycle friends.

34:08.032 --> 34:11.235
''Dear John'' letter
just doesn't suffice anymore.

34:11.299 --> 34:12.400
ls that a problem?

34:12.466 --> 34:14.100
lt gives her
a motive to lie.

34:14.766 --> 34:17.268
l'd be a lot happier
if we had a second witness.

34:17.331 --> 34:22.303
Yeah, well, while you
were out baby-sitting,
the judge issued a ruling.

34:22.366 --> 34:24.668
''Milton
'the Phantom' Stillman
does not have to testify

34:24.733 --> 34:27.168
''about anything he
Iearned from sources.

34:27.232 --> 34:30.068
''But he does have
to tell what he
witnessed personally.''

34:31.532 --> 34:34.067
He'll probably say
he had a bag over his head.

34:34.132 --> 34:35.333
l'm not sure l'd
want to put him

34:35.399 --> 34:37.333
in front of
the grand jury anyway.

34:38.199 --> 34:41.435
He won't sign a waiver
of immunity, and he
doesn't have to.

34:41.498 --> 34:42.600
ADAM: And?

34:43.498 --> 34:45.534
Without the waiver,
full immunity's automatic.

34:45.599 --> 34:48.201
l don't know enough about
what happened in that bar.

34:49.766 --> 34:51.634
Do you think
he killed that boy?

34:54.299 --> 34:55.333
No.

34:55.833 --> 34:56.833
Then you call him.

34:56.899 --> 34:58.267
And you move this ahead.

35:02.432 --> 35:05.301
Yeah, l was standing
at the bar, so were
a lot of people.

35:05.366 --> 35:06.667
JACK: Like who?

35:06.733 --> 35:09.869
Spaceman, Super Steve,
a guy named Ed.

35:09.933 --> 35:12.635
What about Thomas Bell
and Caridad Montero?

35:12.699 --> 35:13.733
They were there.

35:13.799 --> 35:16.301
And Daniel Smith,
otherwise known as Igor?

35:16.366 --> 35:17.800
Him, too.

35:17.866 --> 35:21.536
Did he say anything
to Mr. Bell
or Miss Montero?

35:21.599 --> 35:22.833
He might have.

35:24.833 --> 35:27.535
Let me remind you,
Mr. Stillman, you
answer these questions

35:27.599 --> 35:29.534
or you will be
held in contempt.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.667
Yeah. Igor said
something to the kid.

35:35.733 --> 35:37.167
l didn't hear what he said.

35:37.232 --> 35:39.300
Did Mr. Bell say
anything to Igor?

35:39.366 --> 35:40.533
l couldn't hear.

35:40.599 --> 35:42.600
Did you see
his lips move?

35:42.666 --> 35:43.800
My view was blocked.

35:43.866 --> 35:45.067
People were
standing around.

35:45.265 --> 35:46.566
Around his face?

35:47.766 --> 35:50.101
The collar of
his jacket was up.

35:51.199 --> 35:53.267
Did Igor touch Mr. Bell?

35:54.199 --> 35:55.633
Not that l saw.

35:55.699 --> 36:00.070
Mr. Stillman,
did Igor kill Thomas Bell?

36:00.132 --> 36:01.299
Nope.

36:01.366 --> 36:04.535
lf your view was blocked,
how can you be so sure?

36:06.766 --> 36:08.567
Because l killed him.

36:15.132 --> 36:17.801
l told you!
Igor did it!

36:17.866 --> 36:19.734
You're sure you're
not bending the truth
a little, Caridad?

36:19.799 --> 36:21.634
You don't believe me?

36:21.766 --> 36:23.601
What am l doing here?

36:23.666 --> 36:25.067
l messed up my whole life.

36:25.199 --> 36:26.633
l can't go back home.

36:26.699 --> 36:29.368
And all l got is
this crappy hotel room.

36:29.432 --> 36:32.101
You got a new
life in exchange
for this testimony.

36:32.165 --> 36:33.933
Well, isn't that fair?

36:34.000 --> 36:35.501
Only if it's true.

36:37.466 --> 36:39.334
Do you know
a biker named Stiletto?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.901
That's what he calls himself.

36:44.032 --> 36:45.967
The others call him Stinky.

36:46.032 --> 36:47.833
Did you see him in
the bar that night?

36:47.899 --> 36:49.834
Yeah, so?

36:50.099 --> 36:52.367
He says he killed Tommy.

36:52.432 --> 36:54.834
But he doesn't have the guts
to kill a cockroach.

36:54.899 --> 36:58.202
And if he says he did it,
it's because Igor and
his friends made him.

36:58.265 --> 37:00.900
He is iust as
scared of them
as l am.

37:02.799 --> 37:05.835
Fine. You're
testifying tomorrow.

37:10.099 --> 37:12.668
The can opener thing
was on the bar.

37:12.733 --> 37:14.968
lgor picked it up,
and stuck it in Tommy.

37:15.566 --> 37:17.367
l saw him.

37:17.432 --> 37:20.434
Then l ran out.
That's all l know.

37:20.499 --> 37:21.833
Thank you, Miss Montero.

37:21.899 --> 37:24.768
l have no further
questions for this witness.

37:24.833 --> 37:26.801
Yeah? Mr. Lang?

37:26.933 --> 37:28.901
l have a question
for this witness.

37:28.966 --> 37:31.034
She said she recognized
this guy, Igor,

37:31.165 --> 37:33.233
because he was
her old boyfriend.

37:33.299 --> 37:35.634
Did they part on
good terms or what?

37:35.699 --> 37:39.702
As your legal advisor,
l instruct you the
question is immaterial,

37:39.766 --> 37:41.467
and l decline to pose it.

37:41.532 --> 37:45.135
Miss Montero is
excused, and we'll
take a little break.

37:45.199 --> 37:46.733
Mr. McCoy.
JACK: Yes.

37:46.799 --> 37:48.133
The reason l ask...

37:48.199 --> 37:49.900
We're off the record
now, Mr. Lang.

37:49.966 --> 37:51.801
That's fine with me.
It's just some of us

37:51.866 --> 37:53.634
aren't so sure
about this Igor.

37:53.699 --> 37:57.636
We're still thinking,
maybe it's the other one,
that one who confessed.

37:57.699 --> 37:59.333
Okay. Thank you.

38:00.666 --> 38:02.768
You think that
question was
a lucky guess?

38:02.833 --> 38:04.935
They're kicking
all the tires.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.168
A confession does
make an impression.

38:07.332 --> 38:08.833
You want to take it to
a different grand jury?

38:08.899 --> 38:10.567
No. l'd like this
grand jury to hear

38:10.632 --> 38:13.634
a completely convincing
account of how
and why Igor did it.

38:13.699 --> 38:15.200
Because that's
what l want to hear.

38:15.332 --> 38:16.866
l think Caridad
is credible.

38:16.933 --> 38:19.468
Then explain to me once
again what Igor's motive
WaS.

38:19.532 --> 38:21.333
He wasn't iealous.

38:21.399 --> 38:24.068
Stillman testified
he couldn't see Tommy's face

38:24.132 --> 38:26.367
because his
jacket collar was up.

38:26.432 --> 38:28.200
So Igor killed him
to get a better view?

38:28.265 --> 38:30.500
There was no
jacket on the body.

38:31.099 --> 38:33.000
The motive was robbery?

38:33.065 --> 38:35.734
Well, people get murdered
for their sneakers.

38:35.799 --> 38:38.334
Find out what kind of jacket
Tom Bell was wearing.

38:38.399 --> 38:40.434
Then we'll look
in Igor's closet.

38:42.065 --> 38:44.534
Sure, Tommy had
a motorcycle jacket.

38:44.599 --> 38:47.234
Plus boots, chaps, helmet.

38:47.499 --> 38:50.034
For someone
without a motorcycle,
he's pretty well equipped.

38:50.099 --> 38:52.468
That was Tommy.
Lifestyle was fashion.

38:52.532 --> 38:54.467
What did his
jacket look like?

38:54.532 --> 38:55.799
See for yourself.

39:03.199 --> 39:04.533
This is his?

39:04.599 --> 39:07.935
Yeah. His father
didn't want it,
so l inherited it.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.036
He was wearing a jacket
when he walked into Strokers.

39:11.099 --> 39:12.333
Not this one.
When he left here
that night,

39:12.399 --> 39:14.033
he was wearing a T-shirt.

39:16.099 --> 39:17.667
Where did he get
this one?

39:17.733 --> 39:20.669
Cycledrama, on Eighth Street.

39:21.799 --> 39:22.966
You remember Tom Bell?

39:23.099 --> 39:24.300
Good customer.

39:24.366 --> 39:26.201
l love those college kids.

39:26.332 --> 39:28.167
But he didn't buy
a jacket that night.

39:28.232 --> 39:29.433
Are you sure?

39:29.566 --> 39:30.767
l was closed.

39:30.833 --> 39:33.068
ls there anywhere
else around here
he could have gotten one?

39:33.132 --> 39:34.500
Not around here.

39:36.032 --> 39:37.800
Go on, try this on.

39:41.432 --> 39:42.900
Duralon thread
in the seams.

39:42.966 --> 39:46.035
Anti-road rash padding
in the shoulders
and over the ribs.

39:46.099 --> 39:48.000
Yeah. A friend of
mine rides a Yamaha.

39:48.065 --> 39:49.399
Rice burner.

39:49.532 --> 39:50.900
Quarter-mile in 15 flat.

39:51.933 --> 39:53.401
You have anything
brighter than this?

39:53.466 --> 39:55.267
l'm all out of the pink.

39:55.399 --> 39:57.234
How about
something like that?

39:58.065 --> 40:01.568
Club colors?
Unless you're a member,
Miss,

40:01.632 --> 40:04.735
you don't wear
something like that
if you want to stay healthy.

40:06.265 --> 40:08.033
Well, this poor boy
was killed because

40:08.099 --> 40:10.034
someone was trying
to steal a jacket?

40:10.299 --> 40:13.502
No, Adam, because somebody
objected to its color scheme.

40:13.566 --> 40:15.701
These gangs are
very proprietary.

40:15.766 --> 40:17.200
Making the killer who?

40:17.265 --> 40:20.334
lgor. He was
a hardcore Yankee Rebel.

40:20.399 --> 40:21.867
Stillman was
just a hanger-on.

40:21.966 --> 40:22.966
(SIGHS)

40:23.065 --> 40:24.099
lt's a motive.

40:24.165 --> 40:25.566
Yeah, it's a motive.

40:27.165 --> 40:29.467
lf your victim was
wearing the jacket.

40:29.532 --> 40:32.434
He stopped off at his
girlfriend's place before
he went to the bar.

40:32.499 --> 40:34.667
And she used to go out
with a Yankee Rebel.

40:34.733 --> 40:37.902
The neighborhood girls
said that she used to
wear Igor's jacket.

40:37.966 --> 40:39.000
She could have kept it.

40:39.065 --> 40:42.134
Was this boy
wearing the jacket
or wasn't he?

40:43.000 --> 40:44.067
We'll find out.

40:44.132 --> 40:45.299
We might've found
out already

40:45.366 --> 40:48.869
if we didn't have to
keep popping in here
every hour to report.

40:48.933 --> 40:51.435
You'll report here
whenever l tell you to.

40:55.165 --> 41:00.270
So we assume that
he didn't know it was
dangerous to wear.

41:01.899 --> 41:03.200
Did the girl know?

41:04.966 --> 41:06.233
She must have.

41:07.032 --> 41:09.234
She should have been
crazy about Tommy.

41:09.299 --> 41:11.868
Not that she's shown it
by her subsequent actions.

41:11.933 --> 41:13.734
Your son's roommate
told the police

41:13.799 --> 41:15.934
yOU SaW yOU l SOn
on the day he died,

41:17.332 --> 41:20.068
and tried to convince him
to break up with Caridad.

41:20.132 --> 41:22.300
Convince him?
l offered to pay him.

41:24.099 --> 41:25.099
Money?

41:25.165 --> 41:27.400
He liked money.
It runs in the family.

41:28.499 --> 41:30.901
l offered to give him
$10,OOO for his birthday

41:30.966 --> 41:33.034
if he just got his
damned act together.

41:33.099 --> 41:35.434
Did that include
dropping Caridad?

41:35.499 --> 41:37.434
And going to class
once in a while.

41:37.499 --> 41:38.666
JACK: What'd he say?

41:38.733 --> 41:40.101
l was a meddling old man.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.700
He was Romeo and
that girl was Juliet.

41:44.532 --> 41:48.402
Well, maybe he changed
his mind after you left,

41:48.466 --> 41:51.235
and took your
checkbook with you.

41:51.299 --> 41:54.635
He went to that bar
to buy a $5,OOO motorcycle.

41:56.532 --> 41:58.333
Could he afford it
without your gift?

41:59.632 --> 42:01.166
No.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.435
Maybe he thought
you'd give him
the money anyway.

42:10.265 --> 42:12.867
Buy him a motorcycle?
He'd have to...

42:15.933 --> 42:17.834
Oh, my God,
it was because of me.

42:19.332 --> 42:21.367
He must have dumped
that little bitch.

42:26.966 --> 42:29.702
l don't want to
get into details,
but Tommy and me,

42:29.766 --> 42:31.834
we made each
other plenty happy.

42:31.899 --> 42:35.402
Miss Montero, don't you
think that we can find
witnesses to say

42:35.466 --> 42:38.802
that you owned
a Yankee Rebel jacket?

42:38.866 --> 42:40.601
That Tom Bell
wasn't wearing one

42:40.666 --> 42:42.434
when he got to
your apartment?

42:42.599 --> 42:44.901
That he was wearing
one when he left?

42:45.032 --> 42:47.367
That you knew how
dangerous that was?

42:48.532 --> 42:49.566
So, what if you could?

42:49.632 --> 42:52.334
So, what?
l charge you with murder.

42:52.399 --> 42:54.601
Hey, l didn't kill Tommy.

43:03.666 --> 43:05.734
This is called
the penal law.

43:05.799 --> 43:10.770
Section 1 25.25 defines murder
as reckless conduct

43:10.833 --> 43:13.302
that creates
the risk of death
to another person

43:13.366 --> 43:15.167
and causes the death
of that person.

43:15.232 --> 43:16.499
That's what you did.

43:16.566 --> 43:18.401
l told you Igor stabbed him.

43:19.065 --> 43:20.399
You didn't believe me.

43:20.466 --> 43:24.102
Now, we do, because
now we know why
Igor stabbed him.

43:24.165 --> 43:25.633
lt was because of you.

43:26.966 --> 43:28.534
l want to call my lawyer.

43:28.966 --> 43:30.267
So will Igor.

43:30.332 --> 43:32.600
He'll want to tell his
side of the story first,

43:32.666 --> 43:34.834
cut a deal and
nail you for murder.

43:34.899 --> 43:39.436
lt's not as if he loves
you or anything the way
he passed you around.

43:44.032 --> 43:45.600
What if l tell first?

43:46.232 --> 43:47.800
We're listening.

43:52.799 --> 43:54.700
l knew what was going on.

43:55.833 --> 43:59.136
Tommy liked shoving me
into his father's face,

43:59.199 --> 44:01.200
until daddy made
him pay for it.

44:02.766 --> 44:05.168
Tommy didn't want
to be poor.

44:05.232 --> 44:09.502
He just liked to play
poor and screw poor.

44:12.933 --> 44:15.302
He told you about
his father's money?

44:15.699 --> 44:18.101
Yeah. He was so stupid.

44:19.766 --> 44:23.202
He said that he
had to meet this
guy at Strokers.

44:23.265 --> 44:26.201
l told him let's spend
one last night together.

44:26.265 --> 44:28.433
Old times' sake.

44:28.499 --> 44:31.101
l told him he'd fit in better
if he wore the jacket.

44:31.165 --> 44:32.900
And he went for it?

44:33.032 --> 44:34.800
He loved it.

44:34.866 --> 44:38.269
He thought it'd impress
the guy selling the bike.

44:38.332 --> 44:41.902
Look, l didn't think
he'd get killed.

44:41.966 --> 44:44.802
l thought he'd
maybe get beat up.
That's all.

44:45.466 --> 44:48.335
But Igor was there,
he was drunk,

44:48.399 --> 44:52.269
and some of the other
guys started ragging
him about Tommy,

44:52.332 --> 44:55.435
saying, ''Hey, who's
the new Yankee Rebel?

44:55.499 --> 44:58.735
''Ooh, l'm scared.
You guys are tough.''

45:01.899 --> 45:03.834
And Igor said
he'd show them tough.

45:05.499 --> 45:09.669
He picked up the opener
and shoved it
into Tommy's stomach.

45:09.733 --> 45:12.969
Casual, like he was
passing him something.

45:16.299 --> 45:17.900
What happened
to the jacket?

45:19.432 --> 45:20.966
lgor took it.

45:22.332 --> 45:25.368
He said there was
no way Tommy deserved
to be buried in it.

45:26.399 --> 45:29.101
Look, l didn't mean
for this to happen.

45:29.165 --> 45:31.367
You made it happen.

45:31.499 --> 45:33.734
One boyfriend dead,
one going to jail.

45:38.332 --> 45:40.734
lgor passed me
around like if l was a...

45:46.032 --> 45:48.768
And Tommy traded me
in for a motorcycle.

45:53.699 --> 45:55.934
How sorry am l
supposed to feel?
Hmm?

46:00.232 --> 46:03.001
(SIRENS WAILING)

46:08.566 --> 46:10.834
Didn't we already
dance this dance?

46:10.966 --> 46:13.268
This time it's going
to be a long slow one.

46:13.332 --> 46:15.734
Daniel ''lgor'' Smith,
you're under arrest

46:15.799 --> 46:17.500
for the murder
of Thomas Bell.

46:17.566 --> 46:19.234
You have the right
to remain silent.

46:20.332 --> 46:24.035
We indicted
Igor on murder two,
Stillman for perjury

46:24.099 --> 46:26.534
and the girl pleaded
to reckless endangerment.

46:26.599 --> 46:28.200
She sign
a waiver of immunity?

46:28.265 --> 46:30.333
lt was part of
our original deal,
fortunately.

46:30.399 --> 46:32.434
Good. Night, Ben.

46:32.499 --> 46:34.334
l did do a couple of
things right here, Adam.

46:34.399 --> 46:36.534
You did, you did.
Doggone good.

46:36.666 --> 46:38.834
Three felons,
three felonies.

46:38.899 --> 46:40.533
Something for everybody.

46:40.799 --> 46:42.167
Except the victim.
