00:39.469 --> 00:42.539
He destroyed us,
he's crushed us at all levels.

00:42.739 --> 00:46.142
I'm not callin' Ciro,
I won't even go say hello.

00:46.376 --> 00:48.278
He says we gotta make war, what war?

00:53.649 --> 00:55.852
What's all this fuckin' racket?

00:56.052 --> 00:57.653
Go see.

01:02.625 --> 01:05.294
It's nothing,
they're changing the streetlight.

01:09.031 --> 01:11.233
Malamore wants to talk to you too.

01:11.433 --> 01:14.002
Like he talked to Gypsy?

01:14.203 --> 01:17.906
What the fuck do I say to him?
I got nothin' to say to no one!

01:18.106 --> 01:19.908
Get me a beer!

02:09.156 --> 02:10.556
Move!

02:11.191 --> 02:12.626
Open up!

02:22.002 --> 02:23.803
They even killed Raffaele too.

02:24.003 --> 02:25.805
What do we do?

02:31.411 --> 02:34.414
We have to buy weapons
and we need men.

02:34.614 --> 02:36.682
Get out on the streets,

02:36.883 --> 02:39.552
look for whoever hates Pietro
or is scared

02:39.752 --> 02:42.388
and tell them we'll pay well.

02:42.855 --> 02:44.657
Arms and men.

02:44.857 --> 02:47.226
We already won once with the son,

02:47.459 --> 02:49.862
we'll do the same
with the father. Go!

03:35.806 --> 03:37.208
Go in.

04:01.665 --> 04:04.067
You did me wrong!

04:04.968 --> 04:08.371
You left me alone with the guests
and went off on your own.

04:09.072 --> 04:11.674
No offense intended,

04:11.941 --> 04:14.510
I don't want
to share Azzurra with anyone.

04:17.446 --> 04:19.248
It's all in her hands now.

04:19.447 --> 04:21.250
That's good.

04:22.284 --> 04:24.286
And there's something else...

04:25.287 --> 04:27.489
There's never anything to do here,

04:27.690 --> 04:30.292
we're TV-addicted.

04:31.894 --> 04:34.062
I saw a film,

04:34.863 --> 04:36.899
with that black actor.

04:37.065 --> 04:39.301
He plays a police instructor.

04:40.068 --> 04:42.871
And there's another one
playing the recruit.

04:44.272 --> 04:47.475
But I never saw the end,
the guards kept breakin' our balls.

04:48.310 --> 04:50.312
See what am I reduced to?

04:57.785 --> 05:00.989
Fill me in a little, maybe I've seen
it and can tell you something.

05:01.689 --> 05:04.292
There are two cops from Narcotics,

05:05.259 --> 05:08.863
but I don't know if the instructor's
who they want you to believe

05:09.897 --> 05:12.466
or if the recruit's rotten.

05:13.267 --> 05:15.669
It was only a few days ago.

05:16.837 --> 05:19.440
Find me that film please,

05:20.274 --> 05:22.276
I'm curious,

05:23.277 --> 05:24.945
I want to know who the rat is.

05:28.782 --> 05:30.584
Don't worry, I'll find it for you.

05:32.686 --> 05:34.488
Take it easy, Gennaro.

05:37.490 --> 05:40.060
- Bye, Giuseppe.
- Take care of Azzurra.

06:10.289 --> 06:12.691
Go, brother, get moving!

06:12.891 --> 06:14.259
One dose.

06:14.493 --> 06:15.761
Here.

06:15.961 --> 06:17.029
A dose of coke.

06:19.498 --> 06:20.699
Move it!

06:25.370 --> 06:27.038
Fast! What's the matter with you?

06:32.744 --> 06:34.546
Hey, Mom,

06:34.746 --> 06:35.947
the wind's blowing in your face!

06:36.181 --> 06:39.284
Mom, the red truck's comin'!

06:39.484 --> 06:43.354
- The wind's in your face!
- The red truck's coming!

06:43.554 --> 06:45.056
Move it!

06:45.690 --> 06:47.091
Come down!

06:47.258 --> 06:49.493
Pieces of shit!

07:30.366 --> 07:32.402
How much did we make this week?

07:32.602 --> 07:33.970
Not much, Don Pietro.

07:34.237 --> 07:35.705
The cops are all over,

07:35.905 --> 07:39.375
roadblocks in every square,
so sales are down.

07:42.111 --> 07:45.314
We gotta organize differently.

07:45.714 --> 07:48.918
The police don't have enough men
to control us all.

07:49.151 --> 07:50.753
A fixed base is one thing,

07:50.953 --> 07:53.756
territorial control is another.

07:53.989 --> 07:57.459
The territory's in our hands,
we have to show them.

08:02.297 --> 08:04.499
They don't have to come for drugs,

08:04.699 --> 08:06.701
we'll take it to them ourselves.

08:06.902 --> 08:09.304
Demand creates the market, right?

08:09.904 --> 08:12.707
And the demand's
never lacking for drugs.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.700
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:16.894 --> 10:18.529
What's wrong, don't you like it?

10:20.964 --> 10:24.568
I've been thinking
the same thing for days.

10:28.305 --> 10:29.906
What's that?

10:36.479 --> 10:39.482
About what happened to my father,
Gennaro.

10:43.086 --> 10:46.689
You can count those who knew
about Alfredo Natale on one hand.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.693
You were with me
when they were talking about it.

10:56.699 --> 10:57.767
And so?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.508
Did you do it?

11:17.319 --> 11:18.921
Your father offered me an alliance

11:19.121 --> 11:21.757
where I'd have been
a minority partner

11:23.358 --> 11:25.961
and I didn't like that.

11:29.164 --> 11:31.566
We weren't born to be number 2's.

11:35.770 --> 11:39.407
We have to be the protagonists
of our future, just us.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.062
Brother, I'll be waiting
outside the bar!

11:57.229 --> 11:58.931
C'mon, get moving!

14:13.094 --> 14:15.296
How much did we make this week?

14:15.463 --> 14:17.698
435,000 euros.

14:23.938 --> 14:26.106
- Don Pietro...
- See?

14:26.340 --> 14:28.509
It's starting to turn again.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.911
Yes, but one problem remains.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.714
- What's that?
- Ciro.

14:33.914 --> 14:37.184
He's buying everyone who belonged
to Mulatto, Scianel, Prince.

14:37.384 --> 14:38.985
He's paying lots

14:39.252 --> 14:41.855
and says he wants to destroy you
like he did Gennaro.

14:42.322 --> 14:44.724
I won't end up like my son.

14:56.502 --> 14:58.504
I have to destroy him right away.

16:18.348 --> 16:21.151
I'm betraying my own blood
for you and for him.

16:21.952 --> 16:23.954
Never forget that.

17:07.429 --> 17:09.231
Bye, sweetheart.

17:12.133 --> 17:14.536
- I'll be waiting at home.
- Okay.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.304
Bye, bye.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.940
Be a good girl!

18:27.940 --> 18:30.142
Get down and don't move!

18:32.378 --> 18:33.178
Down!

18:34.179 --> 18:35.180
Piece of shit!

18:35.781 --> 18:37.649
Stay down!

18:37.883 --> 18:40.953
Stay down and don't move!
I'm calling your dad.

19:39.709 --> 19:41.211
Move!

21:01.026 --> 21:02.728
Well?

21:04.296 --> 21:07.799
You killed a child, they won't
let you get away with that.

21:07.999 --> 21:11.002
He killed Imma who was my whole life.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.883
You gotta come back now,
your place is here.

21:29.620 --> 21:31.322
Since all this mess broke out,

21:31.522 --> 21:33.524
I've always delivered your dope,
but I've never seen a cent.

21:33.724 --> 21:35.292
What the fuck are you saying?

21:35.526 --> 21:37.328
I have to pay you?

21:38.596 --> 21:42.199
Now you'll buy the stuff from our
Honduran friends to give it to me.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.871
Our friends...

21:49.473 --> 21:51.541
My home is somewhere else

21:51.742 --> 21:54.244
and I want to be paid for the stuff.

21:58.281 --> 22:00.884
Forget this shit about Rome,

22:01.084 --> 22:03.086
we've always sold our stuff here.

22:03.319 --> 22:05.188
They want it?
They'll have to come here for it.

22:10.927 --> 22:14.297
- Things have changed.
- The fuck they have.

22:15.064 --> 22:16.933
Your Pietro Savastano's son,

22:17.166 --> 22:19.435
nothing more than that.

22:49.886 --> 22:53.489
...because redeemed by death,
absolved from all sins,

22:53.689 --> 22:55.491
reconciled with the Father,

22:55.691 --> 22:58.494
and carried on the shoulder
of the Good Shepherd,

22:58.661 --> 23:00.463
may our sister Maria Rita

23:00.663 --> 23:03.899
join with the Eternal King
in everlasting joy

23:04.066 --> 23:06.068
and delight in the company of saints.

23:06.268 --> 23:08.070
Come, saints of God,

23:08.270 --> 23:10.472
hasten, Angels of the Lord,

23:10.672 --> 23:12.174
welcome her soul

23:12.341 --> 23:15.777
and present it at the throne
of the Almighty.

23:16.545 --> 23:20.549
Grant her eternal rest, Oh Lord,

23:20.749 --> 23:23.351
may she glory in perpetual light.

23:23.552 --> 23:25.854
Rest in peace. Amen.

24:07.961 --> 24:09.563
Let's go!

24:13.066 --> 24:14.467
Upstairs!

24:40.493 --> 24:41.861
Ciro...

24:47.099 --> 24:48.467
Ciro!

24:55.374 --> 24:57.776
You have to do something for me.

24:59.277 --> 25:01.279
Anything you want.

25:02.481 --> 25:04.549
I gotta leave here.

25:06.217 --> 25:08.820
I'll take care of it,
I'll organize everything.

25:12.056 --> 25:13.925
I gotta go alone.

25:16.961 --> 25:18.763
What?

25:19.363 --> 25:21.365
It's over for me.

25:26.370 --> 25:28.172
He won.

25:32.943 --> 25:35.346
Take the money from the safe,

25:37.681 --> 25:39.283
split it between you.

25:41.885 --> 25:44.087
Then we all go our own ways.

25:59.669 --> 26:01.271
Scram.

27:00.094 --> 27:02.497
Genny was a beautiful child!

27:04.699 --> 27:06.500
He looked so much like you.

27:09.904 --> 27:12.706
But he's right
when he says he's a man now.

27:13.407 --> 27:15.209
What do you mean?

27:20.981 --> 27:23.784
We have to let go
of children and the dead.

27:33.093 --> 27:35.128
I was a soldier for you,

27:35.895 --> 27:38.098
I betrayed my brother and sisters,

27:38.598 --> 27:40.600
I'm willing to die.

27:41.401 --> 27:43.803
I even tried to be a wife...

27:45.305 --> 27:48.107
but I don't know how to be
the stand-in for a ghost.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.066
Hello?

28:15.968 --> 28:17.769
I have to talk to you.

28:19.504 --> 28:22.174
It's something that concerns me,
it's important.

28:24.376 --> 28:25.877
Talk, I'm listening.

28:26.711 --> 28:28.313
No, no.

28:28.913 --> 28:30.915
I want you to come back here,

28:31.182 --> 28:32.984
I have to talk to you in person.

28:37.588 --> 28:39.190
Where can we meet?

28:40.091 --> 28:42.927
Where the white roses are,
before it gets dark.

28:43.895 --> 28:45.496
I'll be waiting.

29:14.724 --> 29:16.693
Forgive me for coming in.

29:20.697 --> 29:22.699
I wanted to look at you.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.302
And what did you see?

29:28.905 --> 29:30.907
That I can have money,

29:31.107 --> 29:32.708
I can rule...

29:34.110 --> 29:37.313
If you're not a child,
you know very well what you see...

29:38.981 --> 29:40.649
an old man

29:40.883 --> 29:43.052
who's almost done living,

29:44.286 --> 29:47.289
and a girl, who's beautiful.

29:48.457 --> 29:50.058
She's strong

29:50.893 --> 29:53.128
and has her whole life ahead.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.299
Don't say that.

29:57.499 --> 29:59.901
Since when does the truth scare you?

30:10.011 --> 30:12.013
The deal I'm offering
is not a good one.

30:13.715 --> 30:16.551
You have to take an old man
with all his ghosts...

30:16.718 --> 30:18.519
What do you get out of it?

30:18.720 --> 30:20.121
Nothing.

30:24.725 --> 30:28.129
Except knowing that,
if this old man's still walking...

30:30.698 --> 30:32.500
it's because you're here.

32:50.500 --> 32:52.702
Why are you here?

32:56.539 --> 32:58.708
Poison, Ciro...

33:07.282 --> 33:09.685
I wanted to turn the world
upside down, Gennaro...

33:12.554 --> 33:14.556
but I wasn't able to.

33:59.033 --> 34:01.468
There's just one thing left
for you to do.

34:54.974 --> 34:56.576
The phone...

36:50.586 --> 36:52.588
This is my thing.

38:11.064 --> 38:13.066
Forgive me, Imma.

38:16.402 --> 38:18.805
I can't stand being alone anymore.

39:11.789 --> 39:13.491
Good, Azzurra, it's coming!

39:13.691 --> 39:14.692
It's coming!

39:14.892 --> 39:17.395
Breathe well through your nose.

39:17.562 --> 39:20.031
Good, go, down!

39:20.264 --> 39:23.434
A long one, good, Azzurra!

39:23.634 --> 39:26.036
Again, again...

39:26.237 --> 39:28.239
Wonderful!

39:29.206 --> 39:31.008
It's over.

39:31.208 --> 39:33.610
Darling, I'm here, grab on to me.

39:34.211 --> 39:36.213
I'm right here with you.

39:47.791 --> 39:49.192
Ciro...

39:52.195 --> 39:53.797
Don Pietro...

40:04.006 --> 40:06.409
The end of the day it's just this.

40:20.789 --> 40:22.591
It's all right here.

40:47.782 --> 40:48.816
It's coming!

40:48.983 --> 40:50.485
Hang on to me.

40:50.685 --> 40:53.154
Blow, don't push.

40:53.354 --> 40:54.956
Blow!

40:55.156 --> 40:56.624
Blow!

40:56.858 --> 40:58.226
Like that!

40:58.960 --> 41:00.962
Good, good, good...

41:02.596 --> 41:04.598
Here he is, blow...

41:04.799 --> 41:06.801
Blow, blow...

41:08.536 --> 41:09.737
Go!

41:09.937 --> 41:12.206
Again... Here he is!

41:12.406 --> 41:14.007
Congratulations!

41:18.212 --> 41:19.613
Congratulations.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.480
Hi...

41:25.585 --> 41:27.587
mommy's love.

41:30.390 --> 41:31.992
My love...

41:50.243 --> 41:52.044
No, Don Pietro!

42:20.438 --> 42:21.840
Here he is.

42:27.245 --> 42:29.647
What shall we call
this beautiful baby?

42:31.816 --> 42:33.251
Pietro.

42:34.619 --> 42:36.254
Pietro Savastano.
