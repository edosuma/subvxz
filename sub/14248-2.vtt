WEBVTT

00:07.341 --> 00:09.417
She's out of her mind!

00:09.593 --> 00:13.920
- Explain what happened.
- She hit me!

00:13.263 --> 00:18.554
Your nose is broken in three places.
I'll need to reset it. Try not to move.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.300
We were having a disagreement.

00:21.480 --> 00:26.687
She wanted to realign the lateral
plasma conduit. I said it would overload.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.900
As usual, she wouldn't listen.

00:29.710 --> 00:32.522
So I told her to step aside
and let me handle it.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.534
She pushed me away. I pushed back.

00:35.702 --> 00:39.321
Then I was on the deck
with blood pouring down my face.

00:39.498 --> 00:43.365
- Then what happened?
- She said, "Sorry. Go to sickbay."

00:43.544 --> 00:47.209
At least she gave you
some good advice. Now, hold still.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.420
I'll take care of this.

00:49.591 --> 00:53.838
Keep that woman out of my
engine room and everything will be fine!

00:55.931 --> 00:58.967
- Where is Ms Torres?
- Her quarters.

00:59.142 --> 01:02.393
Put her in the brig
until formal charges are filed.

01:02.563 --> 01:08.980
Formal charges? Come on.
We're 75 years from the nearest court.

01:09.152 --> 01:14.280
The Captain has the authority
to try Ms Torres here on the ship.

01:14.199 --> 01:20.818
- I'd like to settle this on my own.
- She struck a fellow officer.

01:20.998 --> 01:25.707
She's a Maquis. Sometimes you have
to push people to get things done.

01:25.878 --> 01:31.252
She is no longer in the Maquis. And
with all due respect, neither are you.

01:31.425 --> 01:36.799
Allowing her to get away with this sets
a bad example for the rest of the crew.

01:36.972 --> 01:39.759
It looks like
you're favouring the Maquis.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.768
I don't have to explain myself to you.

01:42.936 --> 01:48.130
I'll deal with B'Elanna, then I'll inform
the Captain. Drop this matter.

01:48.192 --> 01:53.530
- That's an order.
- I will yield my authority to you.

01:53.697 --> 01:56.947
However,
I will make a full security report.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.697
You do that.

02:11.924 --> 02:15.756
We heard what happened.
What will they do with B'Elanna?

02:15.928 --> 02:17.967
I don't know yet.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.807
We heard she'll be
in the brig for two months

02:20.974 --> 02:24.557
and that all Maquis
will be restricted to quarters.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.768
Not true.

02:26.939 --> 02:31.517
If things do get out of hand,
we're ready to back you.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.485
Meaning?

02:33.654 --> 02:37.486
If you take control,
you have our support.

02:38.617 --> 02:43.445
If I hear talk like that again,
I'll throw you in the brig for mutiny.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:00.764 --> 03:04.215
Here. It's the medical report
on Lieutenant Carey.

03:04.393 --> 03:08.604
- He's an idiot! When I tell you...
- I don't want to hear it!

03:09.773 --> 03:13.605
The impact fractures
along his cranium were pretty severe.

03:13.777 --> 03:17.905
If you'd hit him harder,
you'd have driven bones into his brain.

03:18.824 --> 03:21.279
I didn't hit him that hard.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.121
So a Vulcan wants to court martial you

03:24.288 --> 03:27.870
and the Maquis are ready
to seize this ship over this.

03:28.410 --> 03:31.624
You've turned this
into one lousy day for me, Torres.

03:36.633 --> 03:40.417
- How long do I have to stay in here?
- 75 years.

03:40.596 --> 03:43.965
I've never found your twisted
sense of humour very funny.

03:44.141 --> 03:47.557
Or you could go back to work
if you apologise...

03:47.728 --> 03:51.144
- Apologise?! He...
- Not just a simple apology.

03:51.315 --> 03:55.478
A personal one, over a hot cup
of pejuta. Bond with the man.

03:55.652 --> 03:59.780
- I won't bond with him.
- You'll need people like him.

03:59.948 --> 04:06.829
- I don't need anybody.
- You will if you're chief engineer.

04:06.997 --> 04:10.366
This is not an example
of my "twisted" sense of humour.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.953
- But Carey is next in line.
- You're a better engineer.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.900
What does the Captain have to say?

04:23.180 --> 04:27.806
She hasn't said a word...
because I haven't told her yet.

06:22.758 --> 06:26.838
Captain's log, stardate 48439.7.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.883
As we head back
to the Alpha Quadrant,

06:30.570 --> 06:33.176
we're conducting
"routine" maintenance.

06:33.352 --> 06:36.637
Routine, that is,
if we had access to a starbase.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.980
Engine efficiency is down another 14%.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.566
If we don't get more power
we'll have to push.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.738
What about alternative energy sources?

06:46.907 --> 06:49.612
Have you got any power
from the holodecks?

06:49.785 --> 06:54.910
Not yet. We hooked them to the power
grid and blew out half the relays.

06:55.820 --> 06:58.498
The holodeck's energy matrix
isn't compatible.

06:58.669 --> 07:01.753
If we relocate
all security personnel to deck 7,

07:01.922 --> 07:05.890
we can reroute power to propulsion.

07:05.259 --> 07:09.700
That would be inconvenient,
but acceptable.

07:09.179 --> 07:13.971
Fine. Now let's move on to
the personnel situation. We still have...

07:14.142 --> 07:19.350
Sorry we're late, but I wasn't informed
there was a meeting this morning.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.766
There don't seem to be enough chairs.

07:22.943 --> 07:26.276
This is a briefing for the senior officers.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.815
I see. Well, I...

07:29.992 --> 07:32.317
I am the senior Talaxian on board.

07:32.494 --> 07:35.780
Kes is the senior Ocampa.

07:35.956 --> 07:40.701
And I know more about this region
than any other member of the crew.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.203
We have some excellent suggestions.

07:44.882 --> 07:48.879
Very well.
You're welcome to join us. This time.

07:50.950 --> 07:52.135
Here you are.

07:54.349 --> 07:57.469
We could use some
excellent suggestions.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.729
You could convert a deck
into a hydroponics bay

08:00.898 --> 08:02.937
to grow your own food.

08:03.108 --> 08:07.900
I understand that the emergency rations
won't hold out much longer.

08:08.655 --> 08:14.528
What about cargo bay 2? It already has
adjustable environmental controls.

08:16.380 --> 08:18.196
- When can you start?
- Me?

08:18.373 --> 08:20.746
It's your idea. It's your project.

08:20.918 --> 08:23.325
Right away.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.837
I can do some wonderful things
with vegetables.

08:27.700 --> 08:31.171
My feragoit goulash
is known across twelve star systems.

08:31.345 --> 08:35.294
OK. The personnel situation.

08:35.474 --> 08:38.344
We've found a transporter chief,

08:38.518 --> 08:43.346
but we need an astrogation plotter,
a chief engineer, medical support...

08:43.523 --> 08:47.355
Several Maquis crew members
would make good officers.

08:49.696 --> 08:55.450
B'Elanna Torres? She was the one
involved in that incident with Mr Carey.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.446
That's right.

08:57.621 --> 09:01.535
- What do you think she's suited for?
- Chief engineer.

09:03.430 --> 09:05.616
- You're serious?
- Very.

09:09.132 --> 09:13.426
Regarding sickbay,
we still need a chief medical officer.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.513
What about that electronic man
in sickbay?

09:16.682 --> 09:20.980
An Emergency Medical Hologram's
abilities are limited.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.676
It can only operate within sickbay.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.524
Not to mention
its lousy bedside manner.

09:25.691 --> 09:31.729
- Someone should be a field medic.
- Good idea.

09:31.905 --> 09:36.318
Lieutenant, you studied
biochemistry at the Academy.

09:36.493 --> 09:40.280
- Only two semesters.
- Close enough.

09:40.205 --> 09:44.730
You're a field medic. Report to sickbay
when we finish here.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.750
- But Captain...
- Stations, everyone!

09:50.507 --> 09:53.876
We're running into spatial distortions.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.801
There's a disturbance
in the space-time continuum

09:57.973 --> 10:00.381
20,000 kilometres off the port bow.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.598
All stop.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.977
On screen.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.936
Gravimetric flux density is over 2,000%.

10:12.112 --> 10:16.525
If I'm right, we're looking at
a type-4 quantum singularity.

10:18.994 --> 10:23.786
I am receiving an audio transmission
from within the singularity.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.662
On speakers.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.628
I think I've found the source.

10:38.931 --> 10:46.143
- Does it look like any ship you know?
- No. Nothing I recognise.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.480
But then it's so hard to make out.

10:49.650 --> 10:53.944
They may be trapped
in the event horizon. Open a channel.

10:54.112 --> 10:59.652
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway to
the vessel near the quantum singularity.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.780
- Do you need help?
- Event horizon?

11:02.955 --> 11:07.700
A singularity is a star
that's collapsed in on itself.

11:07.876 --> 11:12.503
The event horizon is a very powerful
energy field surrounding it.

11:12.673 --> 11:18.711
Once on a particularly dangerous trade
mission to the twin stars of Keloda,

11:18.887 --> 11:21.940
I was almost trapped inside...

11:21.265 --> 11:24.515
- No response.
- Can we tractor the vessel out?

11:24.685 --> 11:27.570
No. The interference is too heavy.

11:27.229 --> 11:32.210
Captain, we're less
than three light years from llidaria.

11:32.192 --> 11:38.990
They might be able to help and
they're quite friendly... most of the time.

11:39.157 --> 11:42.443
No. It's being pulled in
toward the singularity.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.945
We must get it out
of the event horizon.

11:45.122 --> 11:48.325
Bridge to Torres.
How can we get that ship out?

11:48.500 --> 11:52.628
We could remodulate a tractor beam
to match the interference.

11:52.796 --> 11:57.588
- It might cut through the event horizon.
- A subspace tractor beam.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.677
- When can you have it ready?
- Three hours.

12:00.846 --> 12:05.721
- Use as many people as you need.
- Mr Carey, what do you think?

12:06.810 --> 12:11.187
It might work but we'll need more power
to the emitter array.

12:11.356 --> 12:15.769
You're in charge, Mr Carey.
Report when the tractor beam is ready.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.984
Aye, Captain.

12:21.950 --> 12:25.651
Mr Paris? Hold our position here.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.501
I'd like to see you in private.

12:39.885 --> 12:43.669
We have a problem
and it's time we discuss it.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.801
I appreciate
your concerns about Torres...

12:46.975 --> 12:51.269
Commander, this isn't about Torres.
My problem is with you.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.976
- Me?
- Let me be blunt.

12:54.149 --> 12:57.767
- What you just did was out of line.
- In what way?

12:57.945 --> 13:03.283
- When you called Torres in engineering.
- I know what she's capable of.

13:03.450 --> 13:08.445
- I knew she could give us an answer.
- Carey is the senior officer.

13:08.622 --> 13:12.730
Then none of my people
will ever have seniority.

13:12.251 --> 13:15.785
That's the problem.
They're not your people.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.632
You treat the Maquis like your crew.

13:18.799 --> 13:23.100
I'm trying to integrate them,
but you're not making it easy for me.

13:23.178 --> 13:28.469
I can't make it easy. They don't have
the discipline or the training.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.980
But some of them have the ability.

13:31.270 --> 13:35.481
The Starfleet officers
have earned their commissions.

13:35.649 --> 13:41.319
How can I ask them to accept
a Maquis as their superior officer?

13:41.488 --> 13:44.489
- You're asking them to accept me.
- You're qualified.

13:44.658 --> 13:49.119
You're a graduate of the Academy
and you have Starfleet experience.

13:50.205 --> 13:53.788
- Permission to speak freely.
- Go ahead.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.829
I won't be your token Maquis officer.

13:58.463 --> 14:01.215
I'll consider another qualified Maquis.

14:01.383 --> 14:05.595
- B'Elanna Torres.
- She could not finish the Academy.

14:05.762 --> 14:09.760
She could teach at the Academy.

14:13.604 --> 14:17.269
You're right.
I do consider these my people.

14:17.441 --> 14:20.140
Nobody else will look out for them.

14:20.194 --> 14:23.894
Give them more authority
if you want their loyalty.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.109
Theirs or yours, Commander?

14:28.744 --> 14:33.536
I'm trying to help you.
I'm sorry you don't see that.

14:34.100 --> 14:40.540
I recommend you get to know Torres
before you choose a chief engineer.

14:40.714 --> 14:44.842
- Permission to leave.
- Dismissed.

15:00.651 --> 15:04.269
Computer, activate
the Emergency Medical Hologram.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.439
State the nature of the emergency.

15:06.615 --> 15:10.826
There is no emergency.
I'm creating a hydroponics bay.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.912
I hear you can provide
nitrogenated soil.

15:14.810 --> 15:16.120
- That's it?
- I'm sorry. Lf...

15:16.291 --> 15:22.127
So it begins. The trivia of medicine
is my domain now.

15:22.297 --> 15:27.718
Every runny nose, stubbed toe, pimple
on a cheek becomes my responsibility.

15:27.886 --> 15:31.421
- You are our only doctor.
- I am not just a doctor.

15:31.598 --> 15:36.141
I have information
from 2,000 medical reference sources

15:36.311 --> 15:40.120
and the experience
of 47 individual medical officers.

15:40.190 --> 15:44.603
I am the embodiment
of modern medicine.

15:44.778 --> 15:49.239
- How much dirt do you need?
- Four samples will be enough.

15:50.909 --> 15:56.366
Now I know how Hippocrates felt when
the king needed him to trim a hangnail.

15:56.540 --> 15:59.707
You're very sensitive, aren't you?

16:01.628 --> 16:06.290
As a medical practitioner,
I require a certain sensitivity

16:06.466 --> 16:08.589
to properly address a patient.

16:09.928 --> 16:12.633
I'm talking about you as a person.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.305
I am merely a hologram.

16:17.269 --> 16:21.101
Has your appearance
been altered since I came to sickbay?

16:22.650 --> 16:24.188
No. Why?

16:25.819 --> 16:29.437
When I came in, your head
was the height of this cabinet.

16:30.824 --> 16:34.442
But now you look
at least ten centimetres shorter.

16:43.211 --> 16:46.545
I've just run a diagnostic
on my imaging processor.

16:46.715 --> 16:51.377
It shows that I've been reduced
in height by 10.4 centimetres.

16:53.138 --> 16:56.424
- Sickbay to operations.
- This is Kim.

16:56.600 --> 17:00.763
My holographic projector is
malfunctioning. I need a repair crew.

17:00.938 --> 17:03.429
We'll get to it as soon as we can.

17:03.607 --> 17:06.276
- It's just that I...
- Kim out.

17:09.655 --> 17:14.732
Well. Seems like a very busy day
in operations.

17:14.910 --> 17:17.662
- I'm sorry I bothered you.
- No trouble.

17:17.829 --> 17:21.163
- Just turn off the program.
- What's your name?

17:21.333 --> 17:24.915
What purpose would
a name serve a hologram?

17:25.869 --> 17:29.298
I'd just like to know
what to call you besides "Doctor".

17:29.466 --> 17:33.840
They never thought
I'd be around long enough to need one.

17:33.262 --> 17:35.135
- What's your name?
- Kes.

17:35.305 --> 17:40.216
Kes. I'm glad I could help you today.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.433
Computer, end program.

17:49.570 --> 17:53.733
Carey to bridge. The subspace
tractor beam is ready to go.

17:53.907 --> 17:58.783
- Acknowledged. Lock onto that ship.
- Engaging tractor beam.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.909
It's working. Beam is penetrating
the event horizon.

18:06.860 --> 18:09.253
Engineering,
I'm showing power fluctuations.

18:09.423 --> 18:12.210
Damn it! The new relays aren't holding.

18:13.930 --> 18:15.549
We're being pulled
toward the singularity.

18:15.721 --> 18:20.466
Power to the tractor beam is down
80%. The singularity is pulling us in!

18:20.642 --> 18:23.762
Full reverse!
Disengage the tractor beam.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.974
I can't! The emitter relays are locked.

18:27.149 --> 18:32.356
If we keep engines at full reverse
we'll pull the ship apart.

18:32.529 --> 18:35.103
- Cut the engines.
- We're moving forward.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.488
Get that tractor beam off-line.

18:37.659 --> 18:41.906
I can shut it down but I'll have to get in
and cut the main power feed.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.750
Do it.

18:50.922 --> 18:56.462
- Tractor beam disengaged.
- Move us to a safe distance, Mr Paris.

18:57.930 --> 19:02.888
- Are we abandoning the rescue?
- No, but we need some help.

19:03.600 --> 19:08.302
Lay in a course for the llidaria system.
Have Mr Neelix report to the bridge.

19:08.482 --> 19:12.640
We're going to follow
his suggestion after all.

19:36.301 --> 19:38.460
Come in.

19:38.637 --> 19:42.469
- You asked to see me, Captain?
- Have a seat.

19:44.393 --> 19:49.731
I have personally gone over every
emitter relay and refitted four of them.

19:49.898 --> 19:54.940
No one blames you. Commander
Chakotay thinks very highly of you.

19:55.112 --> 19:58.397
He's recommended you
for chief engineer.

19:58.573 --> 20:04.694
Well, we've been through
a few scrapes together.

20:06.390 --> 20:08.827
- Do you think you're ready?
- Ready?

20:09.100 --> 20:12.204
Ready to be chief engineer
on a starship.

20:13.464 --> 20:17.924
I know my way around an engine room
if that's what you mean.

20:18.930 --> 20:20.666
It's part of what I mean.

20:21.805 --> 20:25.885
There's also the matter of your ability
to command others.

20:26.590 --> 20:30.223
I'm not sure I'd be doing you a favour
by putting you in charge.

20:30.397 --> 20:33.813
There would be a lot of hard feelings
toward you.

20:34.693 --> 20:37.813
I'm not bothered
by what people think of me.

20:37.988 --> 20:43.195
The job requires knowledge of
Starfleet protocol and methodologies.

20:43.368 --> 20:47.911
If you don't think
I'm right for this job, just say so.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.706
I'll be honest.

20:52.628 --> 20:57.918
I'm not sure whether you are or not.
I wanted to get to know you better.

21:01.678 --> 21:08.480
- I've studied your Academy record.
- Where did you get that?

21:08.227 --> 21:13.897
Thanks to Tuvok, we had the names
of your crew by the time we left DS9.

21:14.660 --> 21:17.435
Four disciplinary hearings,
one suspension...

21:17.611 --> 21:22.240
- You had a turbulent couple of years.
- You could say that.

21:22.199 --> 21:24.690
- What was the problem?
- The problem?

21:24.868 --> 21:30.159
- The system didn't let anyone breathe.
- We work under that same system.

21:30.332 --> 21:33.368
Then maybe this is just a bad idea.

21:33.544 --> 21:36.414
Why did you quit the Academy,
B'Elanna?

21:38.600 --> 21:43.961
I didn't want to have anything to do with
Starfleet. I'm sorry that I have to now.

21:47.766 --> 21:51.100
- Sickbay to Captain Janeway.
- Yes, Doctor?

21:51.270 --> 21:56.430
Please activate your Emergency
Medical Holograph channel.

21:56.608 --> 21:58.767
Of course.

22:03.240 --> 22:06.407
I'm getting a distorted transmission.

22:06.577 --> 22:13.300
No. In fact, that is how I appear
at present. I'm shrinking.

22:13.208 --> 22:18.665
A malfunction in my imaging system
has been reducing my height.

22:18.839 --> 22:23.631
I've been waiting all day for repairs.
But that is not what I'm calling about.

22:23.802 --> 22:27.880
Nine crew members
have reported unusual symptoms -

22:27.264 --> 22:31.262
severe headaches, muscle spasms
and waves of dizziness.

22:31.435 --> 22:34.270
It could be related
to the quantum singularity.

22:34.438 --> 22:36.893
Quantum singularity?

22:37.650 --> 22:40.232
It was sending out
strong spatial distortions.

22:40.402 --> 22:43.569
They might have affected the crew.
And you.

22:43.739 --> 22:48.864
If we were in the vicinity of a quantum
singularity I should have been informed.

22:49.360 --> 22:54.300
You're right. I'll look into linking
your program into the ship's data.

22:56.585 --> 23:00.713
Hello? Captain? Hello?

23:00.881 --> 23:04.297
- Report.
- There's more spatial distortions.

23:04.468 --> 23:07.919
- There's a disturbance off the port bow.
- On screen.

23:11.990 --> 23:15.596
- Mr Tuvok?
- It is another quantum singularity.

23:15.771 --> 23:19.768
Dimensions are identical
to the one we encountered earlier.

23:19.942 --> 23:23.986
Captain, we've returned
to our previous coordinates.

23:24.905 --> 23:29.448
This isn't another singularity.
It's the same one.

23:42.673 --> 23:45.342
Check the logs. Confirm our position.

23:46.677 --> 23:49.843
They show we've travelled
1.4 light years,

23:50.130 --> 23:53.963
but the star chart confirms
we're back where we started.

23:54.142 --> 23:56.716
- Doesn't make sense.
- They can't both be right.

23:56.895 --> 23:59.980
We're still at the singularity
or we're not.

24:00.148 --> 24:04.478
I tend to believe
that the external sensors are correct.

24:04.653 --> 24:08.152
There's something wrong
with the warp drive and the logs.

24:08.323 --> 24:13.566
Lay in a course away from the
singularity, this time at maximum warp.

24:13.745 --> 24:21.290
Ensign Kim, verify that we're moving
away from the singularity. Engage.

24:27.467 --> 24:30.468
Distance from the singularity
is ten million kilometres.

24:30.637 --> 24:34.338
Warp engines holding steady.
All systems report normal.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.592
Eleven million.

24:36.768 --> 24:38.808
Twelve million.

24:42.190 --> 24:45.191
I don't get it. Have we altered course?

24:45.360 --> 24:49.109
No. We're still steady
on 310, mark 215.

24:49.281 --> 24:52.697
Then something's wrong.
It's ahead of us again.

24:52.868 --> 24:56.533
Confirmed.
We're back at the same coordinates.

24:56.705 --> 24:58.745
All stop.

25:02.211 --> 25:06.458
Transfer all the data
on spatial distortions to my ready room.

25:06.632 --> 25:12.218
I'm going to begin my own analysis.
Run complete system diagnostics.

25:12.387 --> 25:16.520
I want a report
from all senior officers at 1500 hours.

25:17.601 --> 25:21.646
- Who will represent engineering?
- Lieutenant Carey.

25:21.813 --> 25:27.210
You should invite B'Elanna, unless
you've removed her from consideration.

25:27.194 --> 25:29.270
Fine.

25:43.627 --> 25:48.289
The Captain wants you to attend
the staff meeting this afternoon.

25:48.465 --> 25:52.333
I'll give you a full report
on what happens.

25:52.511 --> 25:58.347
I'll be there, too. I'm the senior officer
and I speak for engineering.

25:58.517 --> 26:02.349
Try not to speak
unless someone asks you a question.

26:03.438 --> 26:07.567
1500 hours, deck 1. Don't be late.

26:12.614 --> 26:16.660
You should have broken
more than his nose.

26:21.331 --> 26:25.320
There's no sign of any trouble.

26:25.210 --> 26:29.420
- The navigational array?
- I'll have the results in an hour.

26:29.214 --> 26:32.490
I hear there's been trouble
in engineering.

26:32.217 --> 26:35.966
- The altercation has been resolved.
- That's not what I hear.

26:36.138 --> 26:40.550
I hear the Maquis and Starfleet people
are at each other's throats.

26:40.726 --> 26:44.474
I am amazed
by the human capacity for hyperbole.

26:44.646 --> 26:48.980
The situation
may be characterised as tense,

26:48.275 --> 26:51.975
but one can't say
they are about to become violent.

26:52.154 --> 26:56.210
I hope you're right.
Things are bad enough without...

26:56.199 --> 27:00.280
- Are you all right?
- I just have this headache and...

27:01.914 --> 27:05.117
- I'd better get you to sickbay.
- Dizzy. Can't...

27:07.628 --> 27:09.786
Can't focus.

27:09.963 --> 27:12.100
27 crew members
have reported the symptoms.

27:13.175 --> 27:16.211
And yet I couldn't find anything wrong.

27:16.386 --> 27:20.870
I have no diagnosis,
no prognosis, no treatment.

27:20.265 --> 27:22.970
I'll contact you when I can contribute.

27:23.143 --> 27:26.808
And by the way,
I am now 68 centimetres shorter.

27:26.980 --> 27:29.815
I'd like someone to repair my projectors

27:29.983 --> 27:32.854
before I have trouble
reaching my patients.

27:35.531 --> 27:39.659
I finished my study
of the spatial distortions.

27:39.826 --> 27:44.204
I can give you a long, boring analysis.
I don't know what's going on.

27:44.373 --> 27:49.118
The readings are confused.
None of it makes sense.

27:49.294 --> 27:54.537
- Anything more constructive?
- Diagnostics have revealed nothing.

27:54.716 --> 27:59.378
I sent out a tachyon signal
but all I got back was static.

27:59.555 --> 28:05.141
B'Elanna, do you think you can work
with Mr Carey to clean up that signal?

28:05.310 --> 28:07.267
- Yes.
- Good.

28:07.437 --> 28:09.679
But it won't work.

28:09.856 --> 28:13.522
I mean, it was a good idea to try it
but it won't work.

28:13.694 --> 28:16.101
You have another idea?

28:18.730 --> 28:22.901
About the problem with
the Doctor's holographic projectors...

28:23.780 --> 28:27.491
The distortions might be interfering
with their phase alignment.

28:27.666 --> 28:29.457
That was my guess.

28:29.626 --> 28:34.205
I could screen out those distortions
by setting up a damping field.

28:34.381 --> 28:37.797
Is our priority here
the Medical Holograph system?

28:37.968 --> 28:44.530
If the distortions are also interfering with
the transmission from the other ship...

28:44.224 --> 28:49.100
We could set up a field around our
sensors and communicate with them.

28:49.271 --> 28:52.225
Exactly.
And they may know what's going on.

28:52.399 --> 28:54.937
Let's give it a try. Dismissed.

29:16.632 --> 29:21.970
Emitters on-line. I'm rerouting the
damping field through the deflector grid.

29:22.137 --> 29:24.177
Open a channel to the other ship.

29:27.643 --> 29:30.181
Ramping up field intensity.

29:32.272 --> 29:35.855
It's working.
We're cutting through the distortions.

29:38.445 --> 29:40.687
...to the vessel near...

29:40.864 --> 29:44.565
Remodulate the EM band.
See if you can clear it up more.

29:44.743 --> 29:48.242
Compensating for aperture distortion.

29:48.413 --> 29:53.752
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway to
the vessel near the quantum singularity.

29:53.919 --> 29:56.492
Do you need help?

29:56.672 --> 29:59.163
That's your hail.

29:59.341 --> 30:03.670
I'm applying the damping field
to our visual scanners.

30:07.724 --> 30:10.844
It's the Voyager. It's us.

30:24.157 --> 30:30.907
- Sensors confirm it's definitely Voyager.
- I've been hailing the ship. No response.

30:31.810 --> 30:37.333
You won't get a response.
I sent that message out nine hours ago.

30:37.504 --> 30:42.166
- Could we have travelled back in time?
- No, that's not it.

30:43.343 --> 30:46.926
I think I have an explanation.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.176
Think of it like this.

30:52.352 --> 30:56.101
You're sitting at the bottom of a pond,
which is frozen over.

30:56.273 --> 31:00.210
You look up at the surface
and see a reflection of yourself.

31:00.193 --> 31:05.698
You might think you're looking at
another person looking back at you.

31:05.866 --> 31:11.655
We're staring at the surface of
the event horizon and seeing ourselves.

31:11.830 --> 31:14.582
We're the ones trapped
in the singularity?

31:14.750 --> 31:16.742
- Yes.
- You're right.

31:16.919 --> 31:19.588
It explains everything that's happened.

31:19.755 --> 31:23.799
We've been in this singularity
since we felt the first jolt.

31:23.967 --> 31:26.292
Let me get this straight.

31:26.470 --> 31:31.428
We were cruising along, then we pick
up a distress call and investigate.

31:31.600 --> 31:35.218
But the other ship
is actually just a reflection of us

31:35.395 --> 31:40.520
and the distress call is actually
just the Captain's opening hail.

31:40.692 --> 31:45.650
But we picked up the distress call
before she sent the hail.

31:45.823 --> 31:50.319
How could we see a reflection
of something we hadn't even done yet?

31:52.621 --> 31:56.204
- Am I making any sense here?
- No, but that's OK.

31:56.375 --> 32:01.879
One of the more difficult concepts to
grasp is that effect can precede cause.

32:02.470 --> 32:06.590
A reaction can be observed
before the action which initiated it.

32:06.760 --> 32:09.761
- So what do we do to get out?
- I'm not sure.

32:09.930 --> 32:16.300
But I do know one thing-that
the spatial distortions are increasing.

32:16.478 --> 32:20.606
Within nine hours, they'll crush the ship.

32:20.774 --> 32:24.641
If your analogy's correct,
how do we get through that ice?

32:24.820 --> 32:26.859
- Look for a crack.
- Or make one.

32:27.300 --> 32:31.194
- Smack something into the ice.
- We've already made a crack.

32:31.368 --> 32:35.448
- When we first entered.
- We could slip out the way we came in.

32:35.622 --> 32:38.872
We'd be looking for
a subspace instability.

32:39.420 --> 32:42.661
What would make it show up
on our sensors? Warp particles.

32:42.838 --> 32:48.177
We might be able to see them escaping
through the rupture we made.

32:49.845 --> 32:52.596
Take the main deflector off-line.

32:52.764 --> 32:57.722
Reroute the plasma flow to the main
deflector to generate a warp field.

32:57.895 --> 33:01.980
- Deflectors off-line.
- Initialising plasma flow.

33:01.273 --> 33:04.274
Release the warp particles.

33:09.239 --> 33:11.991
- Scanning the singularity.
- Anything?

33:12.159 --> 33:15.444
Not yet. Warp particles at full intensity.

33:15.621 --> 33:18.954
I'm picking up something.
A slight irregularity.

33:19.124 --> 33:22.659
It could be a rupture
in the event horizon.

33:22.836 --> 33:25.327
Put it on screen.

33:27.132 --> 33:33.301
It is a rupture, Captain.
It's 15 metres by ten metres.

33:33.472 --> 33:36.259
It's too small. It must have collapsed.

33:36.433 --> 33:39.932
We found the crack.
Now, how do we make it bigger?

33:40.103 --> 33:43.603
Force it open.
We could try a dekyon beam.

33:43.774 --> 33:48.103
All right, a dekyon beam.
Mr Paris, bring us closer.

33:48.278 --> 33:52.739
If we get too close to the rupture
we might make it collapse further.

33:52.908 --> 33:56.740
- Can we emit a beam from here?
- It's 50 million kilometres away.

33:56.912 --> 34:01.621
- We don't have enough power.
- We'll have to take a shuttlecraft.

34:01.792 --> 34:05.706
You'll need the best pilot you've got.
That'll be me.

34:05.879 --> 34:08.380
Getting there is the easy part.

34:08.215 --> 34:11.418
We need someone
who knows temporal mechanics.

34:11.592 --> 34:15.128
I don't think that's you.

34:15.304 --> 34:19.469
B'Elanna, you're with me.
The bridge is yours, Commander.

34:37.411 --> 34:41.989
- We've cleared Voyager.
- Shields at full strength.

34:42.166 --> 34:46.827
We'll reach the rupture in four minutes.
Get that dekyon beam on-line.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.329
Remodulating emitters.

34:55.469 --> 34:59.515
Captain, I want to apologise

34:59.683 --> 35:03.432
for losing my temper
in your ready room.

35:04.646 --> 35:09.107
I think maybe you were hitting
a little bit too close to home.

35:10.680 --> 35:15.941
I respect Chakotay but he's wrong. I'm
not officer material and we both know it.

35:16.116 --> 35:18.323
The truth is, I quit the Academy

35:18.493 --> 35:22.491
because I realised
I couldn't make it in Starfleet.

35:22.664 --> 35:25.784
And believe me,
no one was sorry to see me go.

35:27.919 --> 35:31.400
- Professor Chapman was.
- What?

35:33.217 --> 35:36.400
He put a letter in your permanent file,

35:36.178 --> 35:39.262
saying if you reapplied,
he would support you.

35:39.431 --> 35:44.140
He thought you were one of the most
promising cadets he'd ever taught.

35:45.270 --> 35:48.390
I fought with him almost every day.

35:48.565 --> 35:52.183
I was always questioning
his methods, his assumptions,

35:52.361 --> 35:55.777
and he was always slapping me down
like some kid.

35:55.948 --> 35:58.154
I thought he'd help me pack my bags.

35:58.325 --> 36:03.153
Some professors like students
who challenge their assumptions.

36:03.330 --> 36:07.707
And so do some captains.
Professor Chapman wasn't alone.

36:07.876 --> 36:13.333
Many of your teachers thought
you'd be an outstanding officer.

36:13.507 --> 36:17.125
You had more friends at the Academy
than you realised.

36:19.221 --> 36:23.717
We're 15 kilometres from the rupture.
Charge the dekyon beam.

36:23.892 --> 36:26.383
Dekyon beam on-line.

36:28.355 --> 36:31.724
- Shields down to 62%.
- Increase speed.

36:31.900 --> 36:35.898
We have to get to that rupture
before we're torn apart.

36:43.412 --> 36:47.623
All right. Let's open
this hole in the ice a little wider.

36:47.791 --> 36:50.543
Initiate the dekyon beam.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.246
They've widened the rupture by 35%.

36:54.423 --> 36:58.337
They'll have to widen it twice that much.

36:58.510 --> 37:02.175
Hold our position! Mr Tuvok, report.

37:03.265 --> 37:06.716
The spatial distortions are increasing.

37:06.894 --> 37:11.306
We've widened the opening by 65%.
I'd like another five.

37:11.481 --> 37:15.479
We're losing power. I don't think
we're going to get any more.

37:17.863 --> 37:20.271
Let's get back to Voyager.

37:21.408 --> 37:24.991
The shuttle is returning.
They've been damaged.

37:25.162 --> 37:28.613
Their com system's down.
I am unable to raise them.

37:28.790 --> 37:30.997
The rupture's 120 metres in diameter.

37:31.168 --> 37:34.850
That leaves us two metres clearance,
either side.

37:39.930 --> 37:43.700
Mr Paris, as soon as
we've recovered the shuttlecraft,

37:43.180 --> 37:47.723
lay in a course toward the rupture
and take us out.

37:55.776 --> 37:57.815
This is a problem.

37:58.862 --> 38:03.192
One of them is a temporal reflection,
but which one?

38:03.367 --> 38:06.202
I'm getting identical
readings from both.

38:06.370 --> 38:11.660
The rupture is collapsing. Voyager
must get through it in five minutes.

38:11.833 --> 38:14.704
So we have one chance
to pick the correct ship.

38:14.878 --> 38:19.374
Simple choice. Port or starboard?

38:20.300 --> 38:23.135
- Starboard.
- Port.

38:23.303 --> 38:26.672
The port ship is closer to the rupture.

38:26.849 --> 38:32.560
That means they're holding position
as close as they can to the rupture,

38:32.229 --> 38:34.518
waiting for us to dock.

38:34.689 --> 38:40.396
No. It's facing the wrong direction. The
Starboard ship is facing away from us.

38:40.571 --> 38:42.610
They're giving us easy access.

38:42.781 --> 38:46.565
There has to be some way
to tell them apart.

38:46.743 --> 38:50.492
The starboard ship's thrusters
are at standby.

38:50.664 --> 38:53.360
The port ship is moving to the rupture.

38:53.208 --> 38:56.126
Then I was right. It's the port ship.

38:56.295 --> 39:00.339
Voyager moved toward the rupture
when we first discovered it.

39:00.507 --> 39:03.450
So the port ship
is moving toward it now.

39:03.218 --> 39:06.338
It's a reflection of what we did before.

39:06.513 --> 39:11.222
The starboard ship's the real one.
They're waiting for us.

39:11.393 --> 39:13.516
If you're wrong...

39:14.938 --> 39:17.180
we'll have a long time to debate it.

39:35.876 --> 39:39.825
- We're ready to dock.
- All right. Cut the thrusters.

39:40.964 --> 39:43.289
Let's see what happens.

39:52.184 --> 39:56.431
Feels like a real ship to me.
Let's get back to the bridge.

40:00.442 --> 40:03.111
- Report.
- We're almost to the rupture.

40:03.278 --> 40:05.650
Mr Paris is about to impress us.

40:05.823 --> 40:10.690
- The rupture's down to 110 metres.
- We're not going to make it.

40:15.457 --> 40:22.171
They say that manoeuvering
a starship is a very delicate process.

40:22.339 --> 40:26.467
But over the years
I've learned that sometimes...

40:26.635 --> 40:30.253
you just have
to punch your way through.

40:30.430 --> 40:34.345
Mr Paris, full impulse power.

40:39.439 --> 40:41.562
Shields are down.

40:42.526 --> 40:47.402
- I'm losing power to the engine.
- Switching to auxiliary power.

40:47.573 --> 40:52.649
- Hull integrity failing.
- Keep it together, Mr Paris.

41:01.461 --> 41:05.839
We've cleared the event horizon.
We've returned to normal space.

41:06.800 --> 41:09.423
"Sometimes you
just have to punch your way through."

41:09.594 --> 41:11.883
I'll have to remember that one.

41:12.550 --> 41:18.260
I want to be 100 million kilometres from
the singularity before we begin repairs.

41:30.532 --> 41:32.774
There they are. Your staff.

41:35.704 --> 41:38.907
I'll try not to break any of their noses.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.496
The Captain wants the warp drive
back on-line by 1300 hours.

41:44.671 --> 41:48.206
- 1300? That's impossible.
- Then go break a few noses.

41:48.383 --> 41:51.520
Or at least bend a few.

41:53.263 --> 41:55.386
Lieutenant.

42:01.563 --> 42:05.347
All right. Get that isolinear bank
up and running.

42:05.526 --> 42:07.981
And lock down those plasma relays.

42:09.780 --> 42:11.903
Please.

42:17.790 --> 42:20.697
I'm gonna be counting on you,
Lieutenant.

42:20.874 --> 42:24.539
I'm not up-to-date
on the latest Starfleet protocols

42:24.711 --> 42:30.880
and you're probably more familiar with
the quirks of this warp engine than I am.

42:31.510 --> 42:35.960
I hope that I can depend on you.

42:35.264 --> 42:40.341
I assure you,
you'll never get less than my best.

42:42.646 --> 42:45.563
Lieutenant.

42:47.109 --> 42:50.774
Congratulations. Welcome aboard.

43:04.418 --> 43:07.419
Are you checking up
on your new chief engineer?

43:07.588 --> 43:11.170
- Observing.
- And?

43:11.341 --> 43:15.505
Two crew members have
filed complaints about her promotion

43:15.679 --> 43:19.178
and she may be in for
a tough period of adjustment.

43:19.349 --> 43:23.561
But B'Elanna's going to make
a fine addition to this crew.

43:25.355 --> 43:27.893
Our crew.

43:28.692 --> 43:31.728
Can I ask you a question,
off the record?

43:32.738 --> 43:37.945
If we were on the Maquis ship now
instead of Voyager,

43:38.118 --> 43:41.368
would you have served under me?

43:41.538 --> 43:44.907
One of the nice things
about being Captain

43:45.830 --> 43:49.128
is that you can keep
some things to yourself.

43:49.296 --> 43:52.100
- Sickbay to Captain Janeway.
- Go ahead.

43:52.174 --> 43:56.124
Is someone ever going to fix
my holographic projectors?

43:56.303 --> 43:59.672
We're busy but I'll send a crew
as soon as I can.

43:59.848 --> 44:04.309
I would appreciate
a certain expediency in the matter.

44:06.146 --> 44:09.480
I'm sorry but you'll have to
take care of it yourself.

44:09.650 --> 44:13.650
It's all right. It's just a scratch, really.

44:13.237 --> 44:16.937
You know, I like you better this way.
