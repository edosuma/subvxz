00:33.650 --> 00:35.944
Don't get out of this bathtub! Julie!

00:36.153 --> 00:37.446
Julie!

00:37.696 --> 00:40.741
Julie Christina Ubriacco!

00:42.617 --> 00:44.745
You're dripping suds
all over the place.

00:44.995 --> 00:47.622
Come here. Where are you?

00:47.914 --> 00:51.001
I don't want to brush my teeth.
I brushed them Saturday.

00:51.251 --> 00:53.879
You'll have plants
growing out of your mouth.

01:05.807 --> 01:07.434
Honey?

01:07.684 --> 01:09.728
Are you all right?

01:14.983 --> 01:18.278
This is why we don't run around
all wet.

01:21.073 --> 01:24.242
I don't want to go to bed.

01:24.493 --> 01:28.288
- You got to go to bed.
- I went to bed last night.

01:28.538 --> 01:31.041
How many times a week
do I have to go to bed?

01:31.291 --> 01:35.587
Once upon a time, there was a princess
and she moved to Queens. The end.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.464
That's not a story.

01:37.714 --> 01:40.592
It is tonight. Good night.

01:40.967 --> 01:43.512
- Change partners.
- Do-si-do.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.430
Daddy, tell me a story.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.682
Two nuns walk into a bar...

01:47.891 --> 01:50.102
- James!
- What?

01:50.352 --> 01:51.561
Oh, man.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.773
- Night-light!
- Night-light!

01:56.400 --> 01:58.527
Damn! Honey...

02:01.405 --> 02:03.115
...did you leave that truck there?

02:03.365 --> 02:06.243
- Mikey did it.
- Good night, Julie.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.662
Mom, want to play teacups?

02:08.912 --> 02:11.456
No, I don't want to play teacups.
Good night.

02:11.707 --> 02:12.708
Good night.

02:12.916 --> 02:15.001
Do I want to play teacups?

02:19.256 --> 02:20.882
Man, am I exhausted!

02:21.133 --> 02:24.177
I know. I feel like I can't move.

02:25.387 --> 02:27.931
Every night we go through
the same thing.

02:32.185 --> 02:33.270
What?

02:33.520 --> 02:35.230
What is that look?

02:35.439 --> 02:36.898
Are you kidding?

02:37.816 --> 02:40.235
Honey, no.
They're not even asleep yet.

02:40.444 --> 02:42.112
- They will be.
- No, they won't.

02:42.362 --> 02:45.240
They're probably outside the door,
playing teacups.

02:45.449 --> 02:47.325
Wait. No. Honey...

02:47.534 --> 02:49.453
...they're probably right outside.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.621
Lock the door.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.582
Oh, Mollie.

02:53.957 --> 02:55.459
Oh, James.

02:55.667 --> 02:58.795
<i>- Oh, Princess.</i>
<i>- Oh, Trooper.</i>

02:59.838 --> 03:01.298
<i>It was a lovely evening.</i>

03:01.548 --> 03:05.052
<i>Was? I take you to the best</i>
<i>dumpster in town...</i>

03:05.302 --> 03:07.721
<i>... and all I get is a lick</i>
<i>on the cheek?</i>

03:07.929 --> 03:09.347
<i>I'm not that kind of spaniel.</i>

03:09.598 --> 03:12.225
<i>Come on. You're the cutest thing</i>
<i>on four legs.</i>

03:12.476 --> 03:14.686
<i>I think you're wonderful, but...</i>

03:14.936 --> 03:17.147
<i>... I can't.</i>

03:17.355 --> 03:18.732
<i>Wait! Princess.</i>

03:19.441 --> 03:21.026
<i>I didn't want to tell you...</i>

03:21.276 --> 03:24.863
<i>... but I'm going to the vet tomorrow.</i>
<i>I may not make it.</i>

03:25.113 --> 03:27.157
<i>Oh, Trooper.</i>

03:27.366 --> 03:28.492
<i>Really?</i>

03:28.700 --> 03:29.868
<i>Bingo.</i>

04:04.945 --> 04:06.822
<i>Yes! I am the king!</i>

04:07.072 --> 04:08.365
<i>The king of the kennel!</i>

04:08.615 --> 04:10.117
<i>Losers! Losers!</i>

04:11.993 --> 04:14.287
<i>Who cares?</i>
<i>She was a dog anyway.</i>

04:14.496 --> 04:16.289
<i>There's another one! Go for it!</i>

04:16.540 --> 04:18.291
<i>Don't tell the guys.</i>

04:18.541 --> 04:20.334
<i>Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!</i>

04:21.128 --> 04:22.421
<i>And another one!</i>

04:22.671 --> 04:24.506
<i>They're all over!</i>

04:24.715 --> 04:26.341
<i>Come to papa!</i>

04:28.677 --> 04:31.388
<i>What will the girls</i>
<i>at the hydrant say?</i>

04:31.638 --> 04:33.348
<i>Ma, check it out.</i>

04:33.598 --> 04:36.810
<i>I got these things on my face to open.</i>
<i>I can see!</i>

04:37.018 --> 04:38.520
<i>I can see...</i>

04:38.770 --> 04:41.189
<i>... wrinkly butts!</i>

04:41.440 --> 04:44.234
<i>They're not mine.</i>
<i>They're your brothers and sisters.</i>

04:44.568 --> 04:47.237
<i>Good. That makes me the cute one.</i>

04:51.450 --> 04:53.201
So how did this happen?

04:53.452 --> 04:54.995
How did this happen?

04:55.245 --> 04:58.957
Look, here come the three kings.
It must be a miracle.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.919
<i>- Who were they?</i>
<i>- They're my masters.</i>

05:03.462 --> 05:05.047
<i>They're hideous.</i>

05:05.297 --> 05:08.925
<i>They're just big dogs who walk funny.</i>
<i>You take care of them.</i>

05:09.134 --> 05:11.344
<i>I don't want any stupid masters.</i>

05:11.595 --> 05:13.221
<i>Someday you will.</i>

05:14.431 --> 05:17.684
<i>I'll never get my figure back.</i>
<i>It's Cycle Four for me.</i>

05:23.398 --> 05:24.983
What are you colouring?

05:29.154 --> 05:30.906
Christmas list.

05:31.156 --> 05:34.368
Christmas list in September?
What is that?

05:34.659 --> 05:37.120
A dog? We've been through this.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.623
But, Mom, we need a dog.

05:39.873 --> 05:44.586
Because, those guys who come to sell
stuff, he could chew their legs off.

05:44.836 --> 05:46.338
That would be nice, but...

05:46.588 --> 05:48.965
And you could save money.
He could babysit.

05:49.674 --> 05:51.885
You know dogs can't babysit.

05:52.094 --> 05:54.638
Dogs are smart.
We could teach him stuff.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.516
Yes, we could.
Like, how to pick up your room.

05:57.766 --> 05:59.226
- Cool.
- Cool.

05:59.476 --> 06:01.520
I'll tell you what I will do.

06:01.770 --> 06:05.065
I promise you
that we will buy you a dog.

06:05.315 --> 06:07.150
And I know you'll treat it well.

06:07.401 --> 06:11.154
But we live in this teeny apartment,
and it wouldn't be fair to a dog.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.198
What if Santa thinks it is?

06:13.824 --> 06:15.325
Let's talk after school.

06:15.575 --> 06:17.160
You always say that.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.037
You always bug me.

06:19.287 --> 06:20.455
Bug, bug, bug.

06:20.664 --> 06:22.457
Go bug your teacher.

06:22.708 --> 06:23.959
Julie!

06:35.011 --> 06:38.515
Snap out of it, honey.
Aren't you bored with that tape yet?

06:38.765 --> 06:41.309
- It's good.
- It's good? With a pass to Julie...

06:41.560 --> 06:45.689
...up she goes.
She scores a hundred million points.

06:45.981 --> 06:50.902
Most girls are obsessed with ponies,
not sweaty men making jump shots.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.113
Should we be worried? Mike?

06:53.363 --> 06:56.950
It's the Suns. If it were
the Mavericks, I'd be worried.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.744
Let me look at you.

06:58.994 --> 07:01.538
- I don't know about the tie.
- What?

07:01.788 --> 07:02.998
Silly.

07:04.332 --> 07:06.960
You haven't seen the whole effect.
Look at this.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.046
It does this.

07:10.380 --> 07:13.633
Are you going to wear that
on a job interview?

07:13.884 --> 07:15.802
- It's a joke.
- I know it's a joke.

07:16.053 --> 07:17.763
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

07:18.013 --> 07:20.098
This is the tie I'm going to wear.

07:21.224 --> 07:22.476
That is a joke.

07:22.893 --> 07:24.478
What?

07:24.978 --> 07:28.857
They'll know my wife put me in
this suit. It's the colour of poo.

07:29.066 --> 07:31.151
Daddy said, "poo."

07:32.152 --> 07:35.530
Mike, what do you think of this suit?

07:35.739 --> 07:38.784
- You look like my principal.
- Even he thinks it's stupid.

07:39.034 --> 07:40.744
He isn't offering a dental plan.

07:40.952 --> 07:43.246
This isn't me. I want to be myself.

07:43.455 --> 07:45.916
You won't get this job
if you're yourself.

07:46.958 --> 07:49.294
I didn't mean it to sound that way.

07:49.544 --> 07:53.173
A CEO of a corporation is looking
for a certain demeanor...

07:53.382 --> 07:54.633
...in a corporate pilot.

07:54.883 --> 07:57.469
Don't tell them you still drive a cab.

07:57.719 --> 08:00.889
Let me drive. Sit in back
and act like you don't know me.

08:01.139 --> 08:03.892
- And don't tell long stories.
- I won't talk.

08:04.101 --> 08:06.436
- You can talk, but, James...
- What?

08:06.686 --> 08:08.480
- Don't tell jokes.
- I'm funny.

08:08.688 --> 08:12.651
- You are funny, in sort of a...
- Corny.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.403
Corny kind of funny.

08:14.778 --> 08:16.196
Bash Brothers!

08:18.782 --> 08:20.158
Look out for that pud...

08:23.704 --> 08:25.163
<i>Sorry about the suit.</i>

08:25.414 --> 08:28.750
My son kind of splattered me
this morning.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.044
We were doing this kind of
"Bash Brothers" thing...

08:32.294 --> 08:35.215
It's not spit-up or anything.
It's just...

08:35.465 --> 08:37.049
...mud.

08:37.759 --> 08:41.554
Frankly, Mr. Ubriacco, your résumé
is not very extensive.

08:41.804 --> 08:43.347
I know that.

08:43.597 --> 08:46.852
Yet people who have flown with you
insist that I meet you.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.520
Really?

08:49.771 --> 08:51.314
I'd be interested to know why.

08:51.565 --> 08:52.649
May I?

08:57.779 --> 09:00.532
Mr. Martin.
I know why he recommended me.

09:02.034 --> 09:05.245
We're on this flight,
and they're having a party...

09:05.495 --> 09:08.206
...and singing that English song:

09:09.541 --> 09:13.128
You know, you're English.
I get on the microphone and say:

09:18.550 --> 09:19.801
You had to be there.

09:20.302 --> 09:23.138
God, I hope he doesn't blow it.

09:23.346 --> 09:25.640
When he gets nervous, he gets honest.

09:25.849 --> 09:28.602
And that is a major
business liability.

09:28.852 --> 09:31.688
- I think he'll be okay.
- I think he's freezing up.

09:31.897 --> 09:36.026
I've been married to him long enough.
I have ESP. He's freezing up.

09:36.234 --> 09:39.946
And he said, "That thing's
been following me all day!"

09:44.910 --> 09:49.331
I'll make a soufflé. If that doesn't
cheer him up, I don't know what will.

09:49.581 --> 09:54.336
It's not like we can't live off my
paycheck. We have a hundred times.

09:54.586 --> 09:57.339
Pink! Mine's pink today.
That's festive.

10:09.226 --> 10:12.604
Man, I can't believe it.
I always wanted to fly a Falcon.

10:12.854 --> 10:17.234
- Honey, how did you find me?
- They told me you were down here.

10:17.734 --> 10:20.737
Mollie, this is Samantha D'Bonne,
my new boss.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.698
How do you do?

10:22.948 --> 10:24.449
I do just fine, thank you.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.535
Oh, honey...

10:27.452 --> 10:28.704
Congratulations.

10:29.121 --> 10:30.497
This is my son, Mike.

10:30.706 --> 10:34.251
- Hello.
- Sometimes he gets stuff on his hands.

10:34.668 --> 10:37.379
- And my daughter, Julie.
- Hello, Julie.

10:37.629 --> 10:39.464
Knock, knock.

10:40.090 --> 10:43.093
- Who's there?
- Transsexual.

10:44.010 --> 10:46.138
- What's it mean?
- It's an airline.

10:46.722 --> 10:48.306
Excuse me.

10:51.017 --> 10:54.271
So you work for Majique.
That's a big corporation.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.356
Ms. D'Bonne is the president.

10:56.606 --> 10:59.401
You're the president?
But you're so young.

10:59.651 --> 11:03.864
- I'm 30. I'm practically past it.
- You can read about her in <i>Fortune.</i>

11:04.114 --> 11:06.158
You're in <i>Fortune?</i>

11:06.742 --> 11:08.869
Actually, it's two pages.

11:09.077 --> 11:11.204
Hey! Mikey!

11:12.706 --> 11:14.750
Wait! You'll end up in Guam.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.627
- Get back here.
- I didn't do anything.

11:18.253 --> 11:20.005
Oh, God. Honey.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.215
They're a full-time job.

11:22.466 --> 11:24.259
Did you get off early from work?

11:24.468 --> 11:25.635
Yeah, I did.

11:25.844 --> 11:28.722
- Was it an office party?
- I wouldn't call it a party.

11:28.972 --> 11:32.434
You never get off early.
What did you do? VP! She got VP!

11:32.642 --> 11:34.644
- Did you get VP?
- Not exactly.

11:34.895 --> 11:39.524
This is great! What a day!
I get a job and you get... Oh, man!

11:40.275 --> 11:42.861
- Let's talk at home.
- Give me the good news.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.072
I was fired!

11:48.241 --> 11:49.951
Oh, honey.

11:51.620 --> 11:55.624
- What happened?
- I think it's because of the cutbacks.

11:55.874 --> 11:59.127
I asked if it was my work
and they said no, it was great.

11:59.378 --> 12:02.464
They said I was the best,
which is why I was most expensive.

12:02.714 --> 12:07.302
I said, "What if I'd been better?
What would you have done? Shoot me?"

12:07.552 --> 12:10.097
You're better than that company.

12:10.347 --> 12:13.975
Nine years and they give me a cactus.

12:14.226 --> 12:15.519
A cactus, honey.

12:15.769 --> 12:18.730
Excuse me.
I couldn't help overhearing.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.691
- Really?
- I'm terribly sorry.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.735
Don't be. This is nothing.

12:23.944 --> 12:27.489
Financially, you don't need to worry
about a thing. You see...

12:27.739 --> 12:30.033
...I'm negotiating a merger
with Maxim Conti.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.536
Next month alone,
we'll be flying to Rome...

12:32.786 --> 12:34.788
...Paris, New Zealand...

12:35.038 --> 12:37.708
I'll just keep him as busy as I can.

12:38.417 --> 12:41.044
That makes me feel a lot better.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.755
I'm sure you'll find something.

12:45.716 --> 12:47.217
Oh, honey.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.386
It'll be okay.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.388
- Knock, knock.
- Nobody's home.

12:51.638 --> 12:52.973
- Knock, knock.
- Nobody's home!

12:53.223 --> 12:56.309
- Knock, knock.
- All right, who is it?

12:56.560 --> 12:57.978
- Buck.
- Buck who?

12:58.228 --> 13:00.272
Buck, buck, I'm a chicken!

13:00.522 --> 13:02.524
Mom, can I kill her?

13:02.774 --> 13:04.192
Not before dinner.

13:04.401 --> 13:05.902
Knock, knock.

13:06.153 --> 13:09.406
Don't torture your mother, honey.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.748
He's cute.

13:18.749 --> 13:22.753
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>Where are they taking everybody?</i>

13:23.545 --> 13:25.672
<i>I'm scared! I'm going to pee.</i>

13:25.922 --> 13:27.591
<i>Put him back. That's my brother.</i>

13:28.175 --> 13:30.510
He's so fuzzy.

13:30.761 --> 13:32.554
<i>Is that kibble on your hat?</i>

13:32.763 --> 13:35.474
I like you.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.686
- Mommy, I want this one.
- All right.

13:39.936 --> 13:42.355
<i>Got any treats? I'm into treats.</i>

13:46.818 --> 13:48.612
<i>It's just me, huh?</i>

13:49.196 --> 13:51.114
<i>So nobody wants me?</i>

13:51.365 --> 13:53.200
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

13:53.492 --> 13:56.370
<i>Okay, I drool more</i>
<i>than some of the other guys.</i>

13:56.620 --> 13:59.539
<i>And I whine a little bit, sure.</i>
<i>Who doesn't?</i>

14:01.625 --> 14:03.627
<i>You smell good. Like cookies.</i>

14:05.587 --> 14:09.049
<i>And dirt. Can I go with you?</i>
<i>I like you. Please?</i>

14:09.549 --> 14:11.051
Mikey?

14:11.301 --> 14:13.470
<i>- Kid, take me.</i>
- Michael, get over here.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.390
<i>Please? I'll eat shoelaces</i>
<i>and vegetables.</i>

14:16.640 --> 14:18.308
<i>I'll even eat dog food.</i>

14:18.558 --> 14:19.935
<i>Kid! Don't go away!</i>

14:20.185 --> 14:22.771
<i>Where are you going?</i>
<i>Where did you go?</i>

14:23.814 --> 14:25.524
<i>Bad smell.</i>

14:25.732 --> 14:29.277
<i>You don't look like dog people.</i>
<i>You look like snake people.</i>

14:29.903 --> 14:32.823
<i>Not the neck! I hate that.</i>

14:33.031 --> 14:34.491
He's kind of scrawny.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.785
<i>I've coughed hairballs</i>
<i>better-looking than you.</i>

14:36.993 --> 14:38.453
Take him, don't take him.

14:38.662 --> 14:40.539
- Make up your mind.
- I'll take him.

14:40.789 --> 14:43.667
Don't let happen to him
what happened to the gerbils.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.503
<i>Why don't I have a good feeling</i>
<i>about this?</i>

14:49.673 --> 14:51.091
<i>So here they are.</i>

14:51.341 --> 14:53.677
<i>My new masters.</i>

14:54.594 --> 14:55.971
<i>Not!</i>

14:57.514 --> 14:58.765
<i>Swallowed a bug!</i>

15:01.017 --> 15:03.061
<i>Tuck and roll. Tuck and roll.</i>

15:06.898 --> 15:09.526
<i>Big room. Wonder where the walls are.</i>

15:09.735 --> 15:12.362
<i>Who needs masters?</i>
<i>I can take care of myself.</i>

15:14.865 --> 15:16.450
<i>What kind of dog was that?</i>

15:18.160 --> 15:19.953
<i>Maybe I do need a master.</i>

15:22.330 --> 15:25.834
<i>How would you like to adopt</i>
<i>a cute little pup?</i>

15:26.043 --> 15:27.252
<i>Same to you, pal.</i>

15:27.502 --> 15:31.006
<i>He was too skinny.</i>
<i>Probably didn't have any good treats.</i>

15:31.214 --> 15:33.967
<i>Now if I was food, where would I be?</i>

15:34.217 --> 15:37.304
<i>In my stomach, because I would have</i>
<i>eaten me already.</i>

15:37.554 --> 15:39.556
<i>Fatter people. This is good.</i>

15:39.806 --> 15:42.893
<i>There's gotta be treats</i>
<i>around fat people.</i>

15:43.101 --> 15:45.353
<i>Doggie dish at 12:00.</i>
<i>I'm coming in.</i>

15:45.687 --> 15:47.314
<i>What's this, metal food?</i>

15:47.564 --> 15:50.233
Hey there, little fella.

15:50.484 --> 15:53.737
- You hungry?
<i>- Are you kidding? I just ate a nickel.</i>

15:54.613 --> 15:56.239
<i>What a guy. What do you got?</i>

15:56.448 --> 15:58.992
<i>Food? You going for food?</i>

15:59.242 --> 16:00.660
<i>Let me see what's in there.</i>

16:00.911 --> 16:03.622
<i>Get your hand away. I'll do it.</i>
<i>I got it.</i>

16:13.090 --> 16:16.468
I would like a Ferrari Testa Rossa...

16:16.676 --> 16:20.889
...Alien Autopsy, a Super-Squirt
Phlegm Gun with laser sight...

16:21.139 --> 16:23.350
...a helicopter...

16:23.558 --> 16:24.810
...a space suit...

16:25.060 --> 16:27.896
That goob's been up there
for an hour. Get him off.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.608
I told you, Santa doesn't want you
to be a naughty girl.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.360
Who are you, his mother?

16:33.860 --> 16:36.613
No, I'm a Vulcan.

16:36.822 --> 16:40.200
- How would you like a death grip?
- Yeah, right.

16:40.659 --> 16:42.994
- a million dollars, a toy store...

16:43.245 --> 16:46.039
- Mom!
- Mommy!

16:47.416 --> 16:51.712
See? I told you Mommy had a big,
important job with Santa.

16:51.962 --> 16:55.465
- Hey, no cuts!
- A spot. Tricked you.

17:04.307 --> 17:07.144
Hello there, everyone!

17:09.688 --> 17:13.608
Merry Christmas, everyone!

17:21.825 --> 17:23.827
- You look hot.
- Yeah.

17:24.286 --> 17:27.164
- How's it going?
- It's going bad. I hate children.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.291
I used to love them. Now I hate them.

17:29.541 --> 17:32.586
This music is driving me nuts.
I want to hurt Bing Crosby.

17:32.836 --> 17:34.504
Something will come for you.

17:34.755 --> 17:38.425
- 40 interviews and no one's hired me.
- Then it can only get better.

17:38.633 --> 17:41.678
- Maybe next year I can be a reindeer.
- Look at the perks.

17:41.887 --> 17:43.847
Hey, guys.

17:44.056 --> 17:47.642
What are you standing there for?
Mom's personal best friend, Santa...

17:47.893 --> 17:50.020
...is ready to see you. Come on.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.938
There you go.

17:52.397 --> 17:54.066
There we go.

17:56.568 --> 17:58.278
Merry Christmas.

17:58.904 --> 18:02.866
- Well, how are you today...
<i>- Mikey.</i>

18:03.450 --> 18:05.827
...Mikey?
- You know me?

18:06.953 --> 18:10.000
What would you like Santa
to bring you this Christmas?

18:10.000 --> 18:10.374
You're Watching 123Movies.to
What would you like Santa
to bring you this Christmas?

18:10.374 --> 18:11.666
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:11.666 --> 18:15.128
- I want a dog.
- A dog? Well, that seems...
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:15.128 --> 18:15.337
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:15.337 --> 18:16.546
<i>No.</i>
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:16.546 --> 18:16.755
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:16.755 --> 18:18.882
You see, Mikey...
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:18.882 --> 18:19.091
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:19.091 --> 18:22.000
...even Santa doesn't control
some things.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:22.000 --> 18:22.052
...even Santa doesn't control
some things.

18:22.511 --> 18:26.515
Now somewhere out there
is the absolute perfect dog for you.

18:26.765 --> 18:28.350
Maybe he's already been born.

18:28.767 --> 18:31.019
Maybe he hasn't. But when he is...

18:31.269 --> 18:33.313
...believe me, I'll know...

18:33.563 --> 18:34.815
...and you'll get him!

18:35.148 --> 18:38.318
- So I'll get him for Christmas?
- I'll do my best.

18:38.568 --> 18:41.822
- Thanks, Santa.
- You're welcome, Mikey.

18:44.408 --> 18:46.326
Here's Santa.

18:47.744 --> 18:50.163
Hello, honey.

18:51.873 --> 18:53.917
Mommy!

19:00.590 --> 19:03.760
Santa is not mad at you.
Now listen to Teddy.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.430
- Is Santa mad at Julie?
- No.

19:06.638 --> 19:09.391
- Will Julie still get presents?
- Yes.

19:09.641 --> 19:11.393
Give me kisses.

19:14.020 --> 19:18.108
Come on, Julie. Cheer up.
How about a pre-Christmas present?

19:35.417 --> 19:39.588
I have to get these shoes off.
My toes are curling.

19:40.505 --> 19:42.924
Good night, Prancer.
Good night, Dancer.

19:49.056 --> 19:51.266
What's the matter with you?

19:51.475 --> 19:53.560
You don't know how to write?

19:53.977 --> 19:57.397
Yeah? You gonna send some
monkey around to bust my knees?

19:58.940 --> 20:00.859
Hey, all right.

20:01.109 --> 20:04.112
I'll come up
with a couple of bills for you.

20:04.363 --> 20:06.114
I was just kidding, okay?

20:06.365 --> 20:09.159
Yeah, and a merry to you too.

20:10.327 --> 20:12.746
You miserable sack of...

20:15.707 --> 20:17.709
You're a fake!

20:17.918 --> 20:20.879
- How could you let him see that?
- You were watching him.

20:21.129 --> 20:22.339
I was calming Julie.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.509
- What did Mikey see?
- Nothing, honey.

20:25.759 --> 20:27.969
- You said he was real.
- I know, you see...

20:28.178 --> 20:30.722
The real Santa's busy,
so he sends these...

20:30.931 --> 20:34.726
- Cousins.
- That was Santa's cousin, Sidney Claus.

20:34.976 --> 20:37.187
He's Jewish. He's his Jewish cousin.

20:37.437 --> 20:40.190
But you said he was real.

20:57.833 --> 21:00.377
<i>All right, you chipmunks,</i>
<i>ready to sing your song?</i>

21:00.627 --> 21:02.796
<i>- I'll say we are.</i>
<i>- Let's sing it now.</i>

21:03.046 --> 21:04.715
<i>- Okay, Simon?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

21:04.965 --> 21:06.842
<i>- Okay, Theodore?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

21:07.092 --> 21:08.969
<i>Okay, Alvin?</i>

21:09.553 --> 21:10.929
<i>Alvin?</i>

21:11.638 --> 21:13.557
<i>- Alvin!</i>
<i>- Okay!</i>

21:53.305 --> 21:55.265
Oh, Mikey, Mikey.

21:55.515 --> 21:58.477
What do you want?
You want a pizza pie?

21:58.769 --> 22:01.146
Great. The Cornball Family.

22:01.772 --> 22:03.899
It didn't work.

22:09.613 --> 22:12.074
Honey, you used to love that song.

22:12.324 --> 22:14.493
What can we do
to make you feel better?

22:14.993 --> 22:17.162
Just tell me the truth.

22:17.412 --> 22:19.414
There is no Santa, is there?

22:22.250 --> 22:24.461
Yes. There is, honey.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.213
But you know what it's like?

22:26.421 --> 22:30.592
I'll tell you. You know how in
Cub Scouts you have den mothers?

22:30.801 --> 22:31.843
Well, Santa has...

22:32.094 --> 22:33.720
...den Santas.

22:33.970 --> 22:37.099
Mike, you want to know the truth,
right?

22:37.349 --> 22:39.976
You don't want us to lie to you...

22:40.227 --> 22:42.062
...and this is the truth.

22:43.397 --> 22:45.482
You know the whole thing about...

22:45.732 --> 22:47.526
...the North Pole?

22:47.776 --> 22:49.194
It's just a story.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.363
It's just a story.

22:51.613 --> 22:53.031
Santa is...

22:53.281 --> 22:54.783
Santa is really...

22:55.033 --> 22:56.284
...from Finland.

22:57.327 --> 22:58.412
Finland.

22:59.913 --> 23:01.164
Give me a break.

23:01.373 --> 23:03.125
- No. He is.
- How could he...

23:03.333 --> 23:05.335
...get around the world
in a night?

23:05.585 --> 23:07.212
- Finland Airlines.
- Correct.

23:07.462 --> 23:09.589
And how could reindeer fly?

23:09.798 --> 23:10.966
Freight.

23:11.216 --> 23:15.303
And how come Rudolph's nose glows?
What is he, radioactive?

23:15.887 --> 23:18.974
Well, how come your
grandfather's nose glows?

23:20.392 --> 23:22.728
I have the answer to this question.

23:23.562 --> 23:26.189
Some things in life are magic.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.608
Santa is magic.

23:31.153 --> 23:32.529
Magic's for babies.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.910
Honey, nice try.

24:20.077 --> 24:21.328
Can I play?

24:21.578 --> 24:24.790
- With me?
- Let's get busy.

25:07.624 --> 25:09.126
New York Centre.

25:09.376 --> 25:13.630
New York Centre, <i>Fox Juliet,</i>
flight level 4-1-0. Roger.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.966
- Knock, knock.
- Hi.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.307
How's the meeting?

25:24.975 --> 25:28.061
We're all posturing, making threats.
Business as usual.

25:28.311 --> 25:30.188
Zero-5-8. Roger.

25:30.439 --> 25:32.941
We'll have to work
through this weekend.

25:33.191 --> 25:35.569
Do you mind staying in Boston
a couple of days?

25:35.861 --> 25:37.029
No.

25:37.279 --> 25:38.530
I'll buy you dinner.

25:38.780 --> 25:41.033
You don't have to. It's my job.

25:41.283 --> 25:43.285
So you'll keep me feeling guilty.

25:43.493 --> 25:46.955
Okay, but nothing fancy.
Just a paper napkin place.

25:47.914 --> 25:50.917
Okay. Just don't sound
too thrilled about it, will you?

25:53.045 --> 25:54.963
It's not that.

25:57.215 --> 25:59.217
I was just thinking about Mikey.

25:59.468 --> 26:01.136
- He's upset and...
- Why?

26:02.888 --> 26:04.890
Mollie's gonna hate me for this...

26:05.140 --> 26:07.976
...but I think we're looking
at the D word.

26:08.226 --> 26:09.311
Divorce?

26:11.438 --> 26:12.898
No.

26:13.148 --> 26:14.566
Dog.

26:18.278 --> 26:20.530
<i>Watch it, pussy. I'm walking here.</i>

26:20.781 --> 26:23.367
<i>Cats. Can't live with them,</i>
<i>can't eat them.</i>

26:23.617 --> 26:25.327
<i>They're ruining this city.</i>

26:25.577 --> 26:30.040
<i>Look at those. Extra crunchy.</i>
<i>Wrap them up, I'll take them to go.</i>

26:30.290 --> 26:33.543
<i>Step on me, lady,</i>
<i>you get a nose in the crotch.</i>

26:35.587 --> 26:36.797
Hey, pal.

26:37.255 --> 26:39.257
<i>This was sitting on a park bench.</i>

26:39.508 --> 26:41.885
<i>Next to some guy who was eating it.</i>

26:42.135 --> 26:45.764
<i>Catch you later. I got a date</i>
<i>with a cute Pekingese on Park Avenue.</i>

26:46.139 --> 26:49.226
<i>Face like a Mack truck,</i>
<i>but what a body.</i>

26:49.476 --> 26:52.104
<i>What can I say? I'm a hound.</i>

26:52.312 --> 26:55.190
Gotcha. Come on now, boy.
No trouble.

26:55.399 --> 26:58.276
<i>Okay, I didn't mean</i>
<i>to steal that Frisbee.</i>

26:58.527 --> 27:01.530
<i>I thought two calzones were mating!</i>

27:01.780 --> 27:03.031
<i>Lousy dog cop!</i>

27:05.867 --> 27:10.247
<i>Hey, liver. Jeez, I could</i>
<i>get used to this.</i>

27:10.622 --> 27:12.999
<i>You got liver? Hey, fellas!</i>

27:13.250 --> 27:14.710
<i>Spot here got liver.</i>

27:15.043 --> 27:17.129
<i>- He got liver?</i>
<i>- That's a shame.</i>

27:17.337 --> 27:19.840
<i>Already? That's a crock.</i>

27:20.048 --> 27:22.968
<i>- What's wrong with liver?</i>
<i>- That's your last meal,</i> amigo.

27:23.218 --> 27:24.636
<i>Then it's a big nap.</i>

27:24.886 --> 27:26.179
<i>What did I do?</i>

27:26.430 --> 27:28.014
<i>What did any of us do?</i>

27:28.265 --> 27:29.349
<i>I bit a cop.</i>

27:29.599 --> 27:31.476
<i>I got to talk to someone.</i>

27:31.977 --> 27:34.104
<i>Too late. Here comes Dave.</i>

27:44.114 --> 27:46.783
<i>Come on. Can't we work out</i>
<i>some kind of deal?</i>

27:47.034 --> 27:49.453
<i>I got bones buried everywhere.</i>
<i>I'll share them!</i>

27:49.661 --> 27:53.415
<i>- Hey, Dave. You big dumb clod!</i>
<i>- Hey, ugly!</i>

27:53.623 --> 27:55.625
<i>You can't even pee right.</i>

27:55.876 --> 27:57.794
<i>Can I take a dump in your hat?</i>

27:59.337 --> 28:01.757
Sorry, fella. It's time to go.

28:01.965 --> 28:03.842
<i>Don't let him see your fear.</i>

28:04.092 --> 28:06.428
<i>Don't give him the satisfaction.</i>

28:06.678 --> 28:09.056
<i>- Kill Dave!</i>
<i>- Kill Dave!</i>

28:15.187 --> 28:18.065
- What are we doing?
- We're going underwear shopping.

28:18.315 --> 28:20.233
- I don't like underwear.
- You love it.

28:20.484 --> 28:22.611
- I hate them.
- You love them.

28:23.737 --> 28:25.655
<i>Look alive, guys! We got masters!</i>

28:28.742 --> 28:30.327
Go ahead.

28:34.414 --> 28:36.792
<i>I'm neutered.</i>
<i>I've humped my last leg.</i>

28:37.042 --> 28:39.711
<i>I will follow orders!</i>

28:39.920 --> 28:44.341
<i>Yo, I can help you meet chicks.</i>
<i>I got this Lassie thing down.</i>

28:44.591 --> 28:46.802
<i>You can call me Spot or Measles.</i>

28:47.594 --> 28:49.304
<i>Hey, kid!</i>

28:50.180 --> 28:52.599
<i>I do everything. Tricks! Roll over!</i>

28:53.100 --> 28:54.351
What about this guy?

28:54.601 --> 28:56.645
<i>Not a boy. I hate boys.</i>

28:56.895 --> 28:58.605
He looks pretty cool.

28:58.855 --> 29:02.234
- He looks like a hot dog with ears.
<i>- I resent that!</i>

29:03.902 --> 29:06.822
<i>Here's the thing.</i>
<i>I got puppies out there.</i>

29:07.030 --> 29:09.366
<i>Maybe. I don't know.</i>
<i>I've been around.</i>

29:09.616 --> 29:12.244
<i>You know how it is. Give me a break.</i>

29:12.494 --> 29:14.788
<i>I promise I'll go straight.</i>

29:15.038 --> 29:18.500
<i>I'll even help out some blind guy</i>
<i>with a pencil cup.</i>

29:19.167 --> 29:22.045
<i>I know that smell. Cookies and dirt.</i>

29:23.296 --> 29:25.382
<i>- That's my kid!</i>
- I said, let's move it.

29:25.590 --> 29:26.758
<i>Move on this.</i>

29:28.135 --> 29:30.679
<i>Kid! You know me, don't you?</i>

29:30.929 --> 29:32.556
<i>Get me out of here!</i>

29:33.974 --> 29:35.600
Him, Daddy. I want him.

29:35.851 --> 29:38.103
<i>Thank you, thank you, thank you.</i>

29:40.856 --> 29:42.899
You want him?

29:43.734 --> 29:44.818
Here you go.

29:45.027 --> 29:49.197
- We'll take him.
- This one's scheduled to be destroyed.

29:49.448 --> 29:52.367
<i>What? No way.</i>
<i>Take me, I'm yours!</i>

29:54.202 --> 29:56.288
- Well, he's been reprieved.
<i>- Yes!</i>

29:57.914 --> 30:00.208
Okay, here we go.

30:02.502 --> 30:04.588
- What are you gonna name him?
- Rocks.

30:04.838 --> 30:06.715
Rocks? How come Rocks?

30:06.965 --> 30:09.426
Because that's what he left
in the back seat.

30:09.676 --> 30:11.595
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

30:11.845 --> 30:13.555
Oh, man!

30:14.890 --> 30:17.059
Here we are. This is where we live.

30:17.976 --> 30:19.728
<i>Warm. Dry. No puddles.</i>

30:19.936 --> 30:23.982
<i>Wait a minute. Nice cushy thing</i>
<i>to sleep on. A little lumpy.</i>

30:24.191 --> 30:26.068
<i>Maybe I'll just dig out the middle.</i>

30:26.443 --> 30:28.153
Honey, is that you?

30:35.202 --> 30:36.453
Hello, James.

30:36.953 --> 30:38.789
What's going on?

30:39.039 --> 30:42.167
Samantha has brought us
a big surprise.

30:42.417 --> 30:44.252
Really for Mikey and Julie.

30:48.131 --> 30:50.258
<i>What a tiny kennel.</i>

30:50.467 --> 30:52.636
<i>I've seen enough.</i>
<i>Bring the car around.</i>

30:54.179 --> 30:55.305
Her name is Daphne.

30:55.555 --> 30:59.267
She's purebred and trained
at the Radcliffe of obedience schools.

31:00.018 --> 31:02.145
Radcliffe, wow.

31:02.979 --> 31:04.356
Daphne, sit.

31:05.148 --> 31:06.233
<i>Voilà.</i>

31:06.608 --> 31:09.820
- Aerobics.
<i>- But where's my personal trainer?</i>

31:14.116 --> 31:15.909
Isn't she a wonderful dog?

31:16.368 --> 31:18.870
<i>I'll have my manicure now, please.</i>

31:19.121 --> 31:21.331
- But I like Rocks bet...
- A dog!

31:21.581 --> 31:23.166
A dog!

31:23.375 --> 31:25.502
Mikey, wow. Finally, a dog.

31:25.794 --> 31:27.921
Play with your rocks later.

31:28.505 --> 31:30.632
But as I was just saying
to Samantha...

31:30.882 --> 31:35.095
...we wouldn't dream of taking
her precious baby away from her.

31:35.345 --> 31:37.597
And as I was telling Mollie...

31:37.848 --> 31:40.142
...we're travelling so much...

31:40.392 --> 31:43.729
...she doesn't get enough attention.
- I think it's a great idea.

31:44.062 --> 31:45.731
Good.

31:47.899 --> 31:50.068
Radcliffe, honey. Radcliffe.

31:53.113 --> 31:55.365
Bye-bye, sweetheart.

31:55.615 --> 31:58.577
<i>Bye-bye? You can't leave me</i>
<i>with these people.</i>

31:58.827 --> 32:02.831
<i>They haven't been properly trained,</i>
<i>or groomed, or...</i>

32:03.081 --> 32:05.125
<i>I'm getting a migraine.</i>

32:05.542 --> 32:07.210
Goodbye, Mollie.

32:08.128 --> 32:10.380
I'll be sending over her things.

32:10.630 --> 32:13.050
- See you later, James.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

32:13.300 --> 32:15.677
Things? A dog has things?

32:15.927 --> 32:17.220
She's just being nice.

32:17.429 --> 32:20.474
The nerve! Coming in
and treating us like a kennel.

32:20.724 --> 32:24.519
She dumps this dog on this family
without even consulting me?

32:25.645 --> 32:27.064
Look what we got, Mom.

32:27.314 --> 32:29.941
His name's Rocks.

32:31.401 --> 32:34.905
Den. Don't even think
about loving on me, pal.

32:37.616 --> 32:39.242
We already talked about this.

32:39.493 --> 32:43.497
Yes, we talked but we didn't decide.
Now we have two dogs.

32:43.747 --> 32:45.957
If I take Rocks back,
he'll be put to sleep.

32:46.208 --> 32:47.626
Take...
What's her name?

32:47.876 --> 32:50.462
- Daphne.
- Take Daphne back to Princess Di.

32:50.712 --> 32:55.175
I can't insult Samantha.
This is the best job I've ever had.

32:55.425 --> 32:59.471
This is your responsibility. You
brought these dogs here, you fix it.

32:59.721 --> 33:02.057
Or I will fix you.

33:04.559 --> 33:05.602
All right.

33:05.852 --> 33:08.146
This is my chair, this is my cup...

33:08.397 --> 33:11.191
...and this is my stinky
brother, Mikey.

33:11.525 --> 33:12.984
<i>Schwing!</i>

33:13.527 --> 33:15.237
<i>Hello, baby!</i>

33:15.487 --> 33:19.241
<i>Oh, my! What a set of paws.</i>

33:19.449 --> 33:22.369
<i>Powder Puff, how about we nose</i>
<i>through the garbage?</i>

33:22.577 --> 33:26.123
<i>- What cat dragged you in?</i>
<i>- The kid sprung me from the joint.</i>

33:26.331 --> 33:29.084
<i>I don't associate with mutts.</i>
<i>I've got papers.</i>

33:29.459 --> 33:32.879
<i>I been hit by those.</i>
<i>Hurts like hell, huh, Daffy?</i>

33:33.088 --> 33:35.841
<i>It's Daphne, you tick magnet.</i>

33:36.049 --> 33:38.176
<i>Jeez! Like you never sniffed a butt.</i>

33:38.385 --> 33:40.762
Why don't we keep them both for now.

33:41.012 --> 33:42.848
The one that works out, stays.

33:43.098 --> 33:45.976
The one that doesn't,
we find another home for.

33:46.226 --> 33:49.855
- I don't know about that.
- Come on. Look how happy they are.

33:50.105 --> 33:53.066
Wasn't there ever anything
you really wanted?

33:57.404 --> 33:58.780
I'll never have breasts!

33:58.989 --> 34:00.741
Oh, honey.

34:03.243 --> 34:07.330
Okay. But the one that
we choose not to keep goes.

34:07.581 --> 34:08.623
- Goes.
- Goes.

34:08.831 --> 34:10.458
- Goes.
- Swear.

34:11.543 --> 34:14.670
Don't. I don't want you
to love me yet. Not yet!

34:15.297 --> 34:18.175
I'm telling you.
You're not in the clear, buddy.

34:18.842 --> 34:21.011
Look! They like each other.

34:21.261 --> 34:23.388
<i>- Mongrel.</i>
<i>- Bitch.</i>

34:23.638 --> 34:26.141
Look, honey, they like each other.

34:56.129 --> 34:58.256
<i>I don't need a bath.</i>
<i>I just lick down there.</i>

34:58.507 --> 35:01.176
<i>Trust me.</i>
<i>I smell worse wet than I do dry.</i>

35:01.426 --> 35:05.430
<i>- Cut it out! I'm warning you.</i>
- Quick, Mike, grab his tail.

35:09.643 --> 35:11.687
<i>What, no bubbles?</i>

35:11.937 --> 35:14.523
<i>And I see there's no slice of lemon.</i>

35:14.773 --> 35:16.733
- Drink it.
<i>- Take it away!</i>

35:16.942 --> 35:21.279
<i>I don't know why they put my dish</i>
<i>up so high, but they serve good food.</i>

35:21.530 --> 35:23.573
<i>Look at this cut of meat.</i>

35:24.366 --> 35:27.411
<i>Here we go. Gonna play</i>
<i>"chase the meat" again.</i>

35:27.619 --> 35:30.163
<i>Eating and running</i>
<i>are my two favourite things.</i>

35:30.414 --> 35:34.292
<i>I'm gonna eat this meat</i>
<i>and save you the fat, big boy.</i>

35:34.543 --> 35:36.712
Bad dog! Stop!

35:37.379 --> 35:40.340
<i>I'm frizzing.</i>
<i>Brush while you blow, please.</i>

35:40.549 --> 35:43.885
<i>Look at your hair. I can't believe</i>
<i>I trust you with mine.</i>

35:46.430 --> 35:48.473
<i>What's this guy doing here?</i>

35:48.724 --> 35:52.310
<i>Gonna get some treats from</i>
<i>the cabinet? Get some for me too.</i>

35:53.020 --> 35:54.813
<i>Hit the clicker!</i>

35:55.022 --> 35:57.858
- Daphne, sit.
<i>- Oh, no, it's way back like this.</i>

35:58.066 --> 35:59.109
Daphne, beg up.

35:59.317 --> 36:01.236
<i>- Start with one hand.</i>
- Two hands.

36:01.486 --> 36:02.612
<i>If you insist.</i>

36:02.821 --> 36:04.990
Rocks, roll over.

36:06.450 --> 36:08.702
Roll over, like this.

36:12.289 --> 36:14.332
<i>You guys are total entertainment.</i>

36:14.541 --> 36:17.044
<i>It's better than chasing hubcaps.</i>
<i>Do it again.</i>

36:17.252 --> 36:18.628
<i>- Julie, paw.</i>
- Daphne, paw.

36:18.879 --> 36:20.172
<i>- Good girl.</i>
- Good girl.

36:20.380 --> 36:22.924
<i>You're getting so much better.</i>

36:23.508 --> 36:25.761
- No!
<i>- What?</i>

36:25.969 --> 36:27.512
No!

36:27.763 --> 36:28.889
<i>What?</i>

36:30.223 --> 36:32.601
- No!
<i>- What?</i>

36:37.773 --> 36:39.900
Get that skinny man out my spaghetti.

36:40.150 --> 36:42.944
- Someone's playing with their food.
- No, no!

36:43.195 --> 36:46.239
<i>Kid, shoot one of them round,</i>
<i>meaty things my way.</i>

36:46.448 --> 36:47.949
<i>Begging is so gauche.</i>

36:48.200 --> 36:50.327
<i>Come on, come through for me,</i>
<i>will you?</i>

36:50.577 --> 36:53.413
<i>Come on, come on.</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

36:53.622 --> 36:55.165
<i>Yes, he scores!</i>

36:55.624 --> 36:57.584
Hey! He threw a meatball!

36:57.793 --> 36:59.711
- Squealer.
- Spaghetti face!

37:02.964 --> 37:06.051
<i>What is that?</i>
<i>Ice cream headache! Pain! Pain!</i>

37:06.259 --> 37:07.928
Sorry, guys.

<i>I'm getting kind of squirmy here.</i>

37:49.636 --> 37:53.598
<i>Okay, you guys are busy.</i>
<i>I'll go right here, no problem.</i>

37:55.976 --> 37:57.894
- No!
- What is he doing?

38:00.772 --> 38:01.815
Bad dog.

38:02.024 --> 38:04.026
Right hand, green.

38:05.235 --> 38:09.781
Unbelievably, incredibly,
endlessly bad dog!

38:09.990 --> 38:13.118
<i>I just marked that spot.</i>
<i>I'll do it again tomorrow.</i>

38:35.182 --> 38:36.808
- Hello?
- Hi, honey.

38:37.059 --> 38:39.811
- How are you?
- This has been a week of hell.

38:40.062 --> 38:42.522
<i>- Is it Daphne?</i>
- No, it's not Daphne.

38:42.773 --> 38:45.567
It's that other moron, Rocks.
He pees all over...

38:45.817 --> 38:50.447
<i>- He'll grow out of that.</i>
- All right, he also is a shoe gourmet.

38:50.655 --> 38:53.533
He only eats Charles Jourdan,
never my tennis shoes.

39:07.422 --> 39:08.965
Daddy.

39:11.885 --> 39:16.390
<i>I'm sorry. I wish I could be there.</i>
<i>I feel like I can train him.</i>

39:16.640 --> 39:19.559
Doctor Dolittle couldn't train
this dog.

39:19.810 --> 39:23.897
<i>So, what do you think, hon?</i>
<i>We should find him a new home?</i>

39:25.816 --> 39:29.069
- Oh, man! You win again!
<i>- But of course.</i>

39:30.445 --> 39:32.698
No. I'll give him one more chance.

39:32.906 --> 39:36.326
Great. If he chews anything else...

39:36.535 --> 39:39.079
<i>...he's gone. Okay?</i>
- Okay.

39:41.581 --> 39:44.292
I miss you. I'm excited about
seeing you tonight.

39:44.501 --> 39:45.877
That's why I'm calling.

39:46.086 --> 39:48.088
<i>We're going to France tonight.</i>

39:48.547 --> 39:51.216
France? James...

39:51.466 --> 39:54.261
...you've already been gone
for two whole weeks.

39:54.469 --> 39:56.388
I've gotta go board now.

39:56.680 --> 39:58.932
All right. I'll tell the kids.

40:00.809 --> 40:02.477
Come say bye to Daddy.

40:06.648 --> 40:08.984
Honey! What were you doing?

40:09.234 --> 40:10.277
Flying.

40:10.485 --> 40:12.904
Flying? Honey, you can't fly.

40:13.155 --> 40:15.615
But those people can.

40:16.616 --> 40:21.705
That is make-believe, honey. Remember
when we talked about make-believe?

40:21.955 --> 40:25.667
The basketball man isn't make-believe
and they can fly.

40:25.876 --> 40:28.628
Do you like them
because you think they can fly?

40:30.005 --> 40:33.216
They can't fly, either.
But they can jump really high.

40:33.425 --> 40:34.801
Daddy flies.

40:35.010 --> 40:38.972
He does fly.
But, honey, he flies in an aeroplane.

40:39.181 --> 40:41.892
Daddy doesn't fly... Daddy.

40:43.727 --> 40:45.020
James?

40:45.479 --> 40:47.939
James. Honey?

40:59.868 --> 41:01.828
Rocks!

41:02.204 --> 41:05.082
- I like yours.
- Yeah, it's so cute.

41:05.332 --> 41:06.958
Where's your collage?

41:07.209 --> 41:10.504
- Didn't do it.
- Miss Craig is gonna slime you.

41:10.754 --> 41:12.798
- Big deal.
- Excuse me, ladies.

41:13.048 --> 41:15.509
Why didn't you do your assignment?

41:15.759 --> 41:20.722
It's stupid. We had to make a collage
of things we asked Santa for.

41:20.972 --> 41:22.391
But there is no...

41:22.641 --> 41:25.686
Don't say that in front of Julie
or anyone in class.

41:25.936 --> 41:28.605
You don't want to upset
everybody, do you?

41:29.106 --> 41:30.816
- It's the truth.
- What is?

41:31.066 --> 41:34.653
Nothing, honey.
Mike, please, just do me this favour.

41:34.903 --> 41:37.155
Don't say anything to anybody.

41:37.656 --> 41:39.908
- Okay.
- All right! Bash Brothers!

41:40.117 --> 41:42.828
- All right! We are Bash! We...
- Mom. Mom!

41:43.078 --> 41:44.287
You're a girl.

41:45.455 --> 41:47.874
Sorry. He'll be back soon.

42:10.731 --> 42:13.483
- Did he win at the dog races?
- Ma.

42:13.734 --> 42:16.069
Where'd he get the jacket? He looks...

42:16.319 --> 42:19.072
- Hot. The word's "hot."
- Hot. Hot.

42:24.661 --> 42:29.624
Excuse me. This is a special evening.
I'd like a bottle of Cristal.

42:30.333 --> 42:32.127
And this is for the table.

42:32.335 --> 42:34.129
He's picked up a few things.

42:38.341 --> 42:39.259
What?

42:39.468 --> 42:42.804
Six months in Miami, I return
to the <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

42:44.931 --> 42:46.808
You've had faith in me
all these years.

42:47.017 --> 42:49.895
What better way to show my thanks
to my mother-in-law...

42:50.103 --> 42:53.565
...than to...
- Rub her nose in it. I get it.

42:53.774 --> 42:56.735
You made good. I'm impressed.
Okay?

42:57.486 --> 42:58.528
Okay. Thank you.

43:05.744 --> 43:07.662
Gentlemen, would you excuse me?

43:09.164 --> 43:10.457
There's Samantha!

43:10.665 --> 43:12.084
- Great.
- What?

43:12.334 --> 43:15.629
I feel so schlumpy around her.
Do I have dog hair on me?

43:15.879 --> 43:17.297
Hello, James.

43:17.547 --> 43:20.175
This is my mother-in-law.
Rosie, Samantha.

43:20.384 --> 43:22.761
- How do you do?
- Hello.

43:22.969 --> 43:26.640
- And you know my wife, Mollie.
- Yes, of course, Mollie.

43:26.890 --> 43:29.851
- Nice to see you again.
- Did you ever find a job?

43:31.895 --> 43:34.272
I'm starving. Let's order.

43:34.481 --> 43:35.649
Do try the duck.

43:35.899 --> 43:39.152
Samantha ought to know.
She recommended the place.

43:39.528 --> 43:40.445
You did?

43:41.321 --> 43:44.157
How else would we get
into a place like this?

43:46.284 --> 43:47.661
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

43:47.869 --> 43:50.414
Have a lovely, lovely evening.

43:50.664 --> 43:52.416
Nice jacket.

43:52.666 --> 43:56.253
She's teasing me.
She bought this jacket for me.

43:57.379 --> 43:58.755
She bought it for you?

43:59.047 --> 44:01.508
We were in France,
at a fancy restaurant.

44:01.717 --> 44:06.471
I couldn't wear my uniform, so she had
her driver buy me this jacket.

44:08.306 --> 44:09.808
Of course.

44:11.018 --> 44:13.979
Gosh, she forgot her pocketbook.
Hey, Samantha!

44:16.857 --> 44:19.943
Is it just me, or was she...

44:20.193 --> 44:22.320
I wanted to slap her teeth out.

44:22.529 --> 44:23.822
It's obvious, isn't it?

44:24.072 --> 44:26.950
She practically offered him
Taster's Choice.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.618
I don't know what to do.

44:29.036 --> 44:31.538
I know people.
We could have her audited.

44:32.289 --> 44:35.042
That is not a good idea.
It's my fault anyway.

44:35.292 --> 44:38.795
I pushed him to make him exactly
what I wanted him to be.

44:39.046 --> 44:40.964
And now he is. I hate it.

44:41.173 --> 44:43.091
He's a keeper. Talk to him.

44:43.550 --> 44:44.968
I know it.

44:45.677 --> 44:46.720
Can you excuse me?

44:46.928 --> 44:49.848
Good. Make a scene.
Here, throw this in her face.

44:50.057 --> 44:52.976
Ma, I am just gonna call the sitter.

44:58.231 --> 44:59.274
Hello?

45:00.484 --> 45:02.569
Yeah, everything's cool.

45:02.819 --> 45:04.446
All right, bye.

45:07.824 --> 45:09.493
<i>You hooligans.</i>

45:09.701 --> 45:11.995
<i>Well, what do you do for fun? Shed?</i>

45:12.245 --> 45:15.499
<i>At least I don't have vermin</i>
<i>building condos in my fur.</i>

45:15.707 --> 45:19.836
<i>At this rate, you won't have fur.</i>
<i>That kid's giving you a bald spot.</i>

45:20.045 --> 45:23.465
<i>My mistress is kind.</i>
<i>Your child is demon spawn.</i>

45:23.673 --> 45:25.175
<i>"Your child is demon spawn."</i>

45:25.384 --> 45:28.678
Quit brushing her.
She already looks like a Q-tip.

45:28.887 --> 45:30.764
Your dog smells like a diaper.

45:30.972 --> 45:33.225
- Does not.
- Diaper dog! Diaper dog!

45:33.433 --> 45:34.893
Q-tip-head dog.

45:35.102 --> 45:36.186
Stinky dog!

45:36.395 --> 45:37.813
Bald-butted dog.

45:42.275 --> 45:44.277
<i>I got it! It's mine. No problem.</i>

45:47.364 --> 45:48.573
<i>I'm homeless!</i>

45:53.036 --> 45:54.079
What happened?

45:54.287 --> 45:55.706
<i>You mongrel wretch!</i>

45:55.914 --> 45:59.042
<i>- Get real. It's just a box, Daffy.</i>
<i>- Daphne!</i>

45:59.251 --> 46:00.585
<i>Come on. I'm sorry.</i>

46:00.836 --> 46:03.964
<i>- Look, I can fix it.</i>
<i>- I never want to see you again!</i>

46:04.172 --> 46:05.757
<i>It'll be tough. I live here.</i>

46:06.007 --> 46:08.552
<i>We'll just see about that!</i>

46:08.760 --> 46:09.845
<i>Let's see.</i>

46:10.095 --> 46:15.142
<i>She yells the most</i>
<i>when he gets the ones in boxes.</i>

46:16.184 --> 46:18.478
<i>What does he see</i>
<i>in these smelly things?</i>

46:18.687 --> 46:23.442
<i>Courage, Daphne, courage.</i>
<i>You'll be rid of him soon.</i>

46:23.650 --> 46:28.363
You think there's nothing weird about
buying someone dinner and clothing?

46:28.572 --> 46:31.825
If a guy asks me to Le Cirque
and buys me a teddy, it's okay?

46:32.075 --> 46:35.370
A jacket's not a teddy.
This is a teddy.

46:36.288 --> 46:40.000
I'm trying not to be a shrew
and scream and hate her guts.

46:40.250 --> 46:44.171
Although I wouldn't mind seeing
her decomposing body by the river.

46:44.421 --> 46:46.965
You don't have to socialize with her.

46:47.215 --> 46:49.384
Just keep your eyes on the road...

46:49.634 --> 46:52.721
...or the sky or whatever you keep
your eyes on.

46:52.971 --> 46:55.849
Answer me this:
Why is it that I can trust you...

46:56.099 --> 46:59.353
...when you had an affair
with a married client?

46:59.561 --> 47:02.689
That was 8 billion years ago!
I never see him.

47:02.939 --> 47:06.485
How do I know that? I can only trust.
I have faith in you.

47:06.693 --> 47:09.613
You don't have much faith
if you keep bringing it up.

47:09.821 --> 47:14.785
I don't keep on bringing...
Oh, honey, listen to us.

47:14.993 --> 47:17.079
After six years, we're still jealous.

47:17.287 --> 47:19.790
- Isn't that good?
- I don't know.

47:20.582 --> 47:24.211
It's you I like. It's not Samantha.

47:24.461 --> 47:25.962
I like you.

47:26.213 --> 47:29.383
Honey, I'm crazy about you.
I love you so much.

47:29.633 --> 47:33.762
Watch out for her. She's real flirty.
I know about girls like that.

47:34.012 --> 47:35.430
I was one.

47:36.098 --> 47:38.642
- Okay. I promise.
- Okay.

47:42.979 --> 47:43.897
He did it!

47:44.147 --> 47:46.233
Mom, it was her fault.

47:47.609 --> 47:48.777
I'll put them to bed.

47:49.027 --> 47:52.531
Honey, don't ruin it.
Don't ruin the moment.

47:58.578 --> 48:00.706
- I don't want to go.
- You have to go.

48:00.956 --> 48:04.209
- But you don't trust me.
- I do. I do trust you.

48:05.836 --> 48:07.754
I don't trust her.

48:10.465 --> 48:12.384
You two, come on.

50:05.372 --> 50:06.331
Hi, honey.

50:06.540 --> 50:08.291
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I'm in London.

50:08.583 --> 50:10.502
I'm in San Francisco, honey.

50:10.711 --> 50:12.254
<i>I'm in Reno.</i>

50:14.214 --> 50:15.716
We're in Dallas.

50:15.966 --> 50:19.428
What do you mean I'm being audited?
It's not even tax season!

50:40.991 --> 50:42.909
Mom? Where's Dad?

50:43.160 --> 50:44.786
He'll be home soon.

50:45.620 --> 50:48.331
Will he be here for Christmas?

50:48.915 --> 50:52.544
Your dad wouldn't miss Christmas
for all the stars in the sky.

50:52.794 --> 50:54.588
What about the moon?

50:56.673 --> 50:58.341
The moon too.

50:59.634 --> 51:00.677
Bedtime.

51:00.927 --> 51:02.512
Bedtime.

51:10.062 --> 51:12.731
- I love you.
- I love you too.

51:20.113 --> 51:21.281
Good night.

52:16.211 --> 52:18.630
- She thinks we're in Dallas?
- She bought it.

52:18.880 --> 52:20.716
- Dumb cow!
- Dumb cow!

52:35.397 --> 52:39.067
And what do you want
for Christmas, little boy?

52:43.030 --> 52:45.240
Well, Mollie...

52:45.490 --> 52:48.535
...I never asked you what you want
for Christmas.

52:49.327 --> 52:54.458
Santa, I can't think of any present
I'd rather have than you.

52:57.753 --> 52:59.129
Oh, Albert!

53:01.882 --> 53:04.926
Come here, you studmuffin!

53:39.419 --> 53:42.464
Honey, what are we doing?

53:42.964 --> 53:46.676
I don't know. This isn't us.
We'd never do this.

53:46.927 --> 53:48.762
Do you think we're dreaming?

53:49.012 --> 53:52.057
I think it's one
where you know you're dreaming.

53:57.312 --> 54:00.899
Excuse me,
but we were having an affair.

54:02.025 --> 54:05.612
Does this mean we can do
whatever we want to do in the dream?

54:06.530 --> 54:08.657
Excuse me.

54:20.043 --> 54:22.713
You see that?
I told you they weren't real.

54:28.844 --> 54:31.680
Honey, you know I can't dance.

54:31.888 --> 54:34.307
You can dance. This is our dream.

55:44.336 --> 55:46.380
Oh, James.

55:46.630 --> 55:49.591
<i>Ex cuse me. Mistress?</i>
<i>Please wake up.</i>

55:49.841 --> 55:53.428
<i>I need to be walked quite badly</i>
<i>as a matter of fact.</i>

55:53.679 --> 55:56.139
<i>Oh, well, I'm a lady. I can hold it.</i>

55:56.348 --> 55:59.685
<i>No, I can't, I'm desperate!</i>
<i>Oh, God, she's in a coma.</i>

55:59.893 --> 56:01.228
<i>Please wake up!</i>

56:01.436 --> 56:05.565
<i>I can't have an accident like</i>
<i>a common mutt. It's too demeaning.</i>

56:05.816 --> 56:09.152
<i>Baby, you are so jumpy.</i>
<i>Let her alone. She looks happy.</i>

56:09.361 --> 56:11.071
<i>Well, what am I supposed to do?</i>

56:11.780 --> 56:13.532
<i>- I'll take you out.</i>
<i>- But how?</i>

56:14.032 --> 56:15.325
<i>Come on.</i>

56:16.118 --> 56:18.704
<i>But we need a master to open the door.</i>

56:18.954 --> 56:20.330
<i>Want to bet?</i>

56:22.290 --> 56:23.500
<i>How did you do that?</i>

56:23.750 --> 56:25.794
<i>I know things not taught in school.</i>

56:26.044 --> 56:27.963
<i>Ex cuse me. I was valedictorian.</i>

56:28.213 --> 56:29.756
<i>Give it up, kid. Come on!</i>

56:29.965 --> 56:31.174
<i>What about my leash?</i>

56:31.383 --> 56:33.468
<i>You haven't lived</i>
<i>till you try it naked.</i>

56:33.719 --> 56:35.429
<i>Don't get fresh!</i>

56:39.558 --> 56:42.060
<i>- How about dinner out?</i>
<i>- I'm not hungry.</i>

56:42.310 --> 56:46.398
<i>You dolls always say that.</i>
<i>Forget your diet. Let's get Italian.</i>

56:46.648 --> 56:49.985
<i>No. I'm so fat these days,</i>
<i>I look like an English sheepdog.</i>

56:50.193 --> 56:51.778
<i>You nuts? You look great.</i>

56:51.987 --> 56:56.074
<i>When I was young, I had one</i>
<i>of those greyhound hardbodies.</i>

56:56.283 --> 56:59.703
<i>- What do you mean? You're a kid.</i>
<i>- Well, I'm pushing 7.</i>

56:59.911 --> 57:02.539
<i>Seven?</i>
<i>You don't look a day over 5.</i>

57:02.748 --> 57:05.959
<i>Do you really think so?</i>
<i>Well, maybe a little Chinese.</i>

57:06.168 --> 57:08.086
<i>I know just the place. Follow me.</i>

57:10.000 --> 57:10.964

57:35.947 --> 57:40.619

<i>When I think about it, Samantha</i>

<i>My butt is freezing!</i>

57:54.800 --> 57:57.928
<i>Nice butt.</i>
<i>No offense, no offense!</i>

58:00.931 --> 58:03.350
<i>It's getting bright out.</i>
<i>We should get back.</i>

58:03.558 --> 58:06.687
<i>- It's only the shank of the evening.</i>
<i>- We really should.</i>

58:06.937 --> 58:08.980
<i>All right. I know a shortcut.</i>

58:09.189 --> 58:11.441
<i>- Through that?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

58:11.650 --> 58:13.110
<i>Wait a minute. What is it?</i>

58:13.318 --> 58:16.071
<i>Mud. You never seen mud before?</i>

58:16.279 --> 58:19.700
<i>It's mud. When the wet stuff</i>
<i>comes down and hits the dirt.</i>

58:20.450 --> 58:22.661
<i>- Dirt?</i>
<i>- Oh, you have been sheltered.</i>

58:22.911 --> 58:25.747
<i>I won't lie:</i>
<i>It's not the highlight of our evening.</i>

58:25.956 --> 58:28.625
<i>Just gotta grit your teeth</i>
<i>and slog through it.</i>

58:28.834 --> 58:32.963
<i>Oh, no, no, no. There is absolutely</i>
<i>no possible way I could...</i>

58:34.297 --> 58:35.424
<i>Firm...</i>

58:35.632 --> 58:38.468
<i>... yet squishy.</i>

58:38.802 --> 58:40.053
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry.</i>

58:40.470 --> 58:43.015
<i>Sorry? I like it!</i>

58:43.265 --> 58:46.810
<i>The oozy gooey-ness of it. It's so...</i>

58:47.019 --> 58:48.437
<i>... sensual!</i>

58:48.687 --> 58:51.189
<i>- It's glorious!</i>
<i>- It's mud.</i>

58:51.940 --> 58:53.191
<i>- Play with me!</i>
<i>- Now?</i>

58:53.400 --> 58:55.527
<i>Play with me in the mud!</i>

58:55.736 --> 58:57.779
<i>You're a wild thing!</i>

59:02.284 --> 59:04.870
<i>This is totally filthy!</i>

59:12.252 --> 59:15.422
<i>By the way, I never asked you...</i>
<i>What's your name?</i>

59:15.630 --> 59:17.591
<i>Me? They call me "No."</i>

59:17.799 --> 59:22.929
<i>Silly. "No" isn't your name!</i>
<i>That's what they say when you're bad.</i>

59:23.305 --> 59:26.558
<i>No. What's another word they say</i>
<i>all the time to you?</i>

59:26.850 --> 59:28.685
<i>There's that "Rocks" thing.</i>

59:28.894 --> 59:31.396
<i>Rocks! That's it.</i>
<i>That's your name.</i>

59:31.646 --> 59:33.732
<i>You are one smart cookie, you know?</i>

59:33.940 --> 59:35.359
<i>You finally noticed.</i>

59:35.609 --> 59:38.236
<i>Well, be cool.</i>
<i>Here comes the doorman.</i>

59:43.450 --> 59:45.702
<i>Permit me to walk you to your door.</i>

59:45.952 --> 59:47.871
<i>I almost hate for this to end.</i>

59:48.455 --> 59:52.376
<i>Well, Rocks, thank you</i>
<i>for a wonderful evening.</i>

59:52.584 --> 59:54.669
<i>It's so ex citing out there.</i>

59:55.337 --> 59:58.131
<i>But it's nice to have</i>
<i>a warm place to come back to.</i>

59:58.590 --> 01:00:03.011
<i>Where you don't fight for food,</i>
<i>and people don't throw you into trucks.</i>

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:05.555
<i>- You mean home?</i>
<i>- Is that what this is?</i>

01:00:05.764 --> 01:00:07.265
<i>It's our home.</i>

01:00:07.808 --> 01:00:09.768
<i>Yeah. Home.</i>

01:00:09.976 --> 01:00:12.396
<i>- I like the ring of that.</i>
- No!

01:00:13.814 --> 01:00:17.567
Rocks! You have eaten
your last shoe around this house!

01:00:17.818 --> 01:00:19.444
<i>- Oh, no.</i>
<i>- What'd I do?</i>

01:00:19.695 --> 01:00:22.239
- You are out of here!
- No!

01:00:22.489 --> 01:00:25.951
Mike, hold on.
Honey, open the door.

01:00:26.326 --> 01:00:29.287
Mike, will you please open the door?

01:00:29.496 --> 01:00:31.540
I want Daddy!

01:00:35.419 --> 01:00:37.421
Merry Christmas, guys.

01:00:37.671 --> 01:00:41.383
Merry Christmas, Tom.
Merry Christmas, Dave.

01:00:42.843 --> 01:00:45.095
Merry Christmas, Samantha.

01:00:48.223 --> 01:00:50.934
Oh, dear.
This is going to be difficult.

01:00:51.184 --> 01:00:54.688
I spoke to Conti. After swearing
he'd keep all our people...

01:00:54.896 --> 01:00:57.065
...he now won't go through
with the merger...

01:00:57.274 --> 01:00:59.276
...unless I let go of 3000 of them.

01:00:59.484 --> 01:01:02.529
You're kidding.
Well, can't you do anything about it?

01:01:03.113 --> 01:01:06.783
Well, I have this one chance.
He has this cabin upstate.

01:01:06.992 --> 01:01:11.371
He wants me to go there,
plead my case this afternoon.

01:01:12.164 --> 01:01:16.043
Oh, Samantha, it's Christmas Eve.
I can't.

01:01:16.251 --> 01:01:18.086
I know. Believe me, I know.

01:01:18.295 --> 01:01:22.340
If there was any other way,
but, I mean, 3000 people?

01:01:24.801 --> 01:01:27.054
Be right back. Ralph!

01:01:29.264 --> 01:01:31.433
Ralph, you're current
on the Falcon, right?

01:01:31.641 --> 01:01:32.893
No. No way.

01:01:33.143 --> 01:01:35.729
- Don, I know you are.
- Christmas Eve, man.

01:01:35.937 --> 01:01:38.273
- Bill, I'll give you $500.
- I can't.

01:01:38.482 --> 01:01:40.359
- 600.
- Hell, I'll do it.

01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:42.110
- 750.
- We're married.

01:01:42.319 --> 01:01:45.364
We want to stay that way.
Jerry might do it. He's single.

01:01:45.572 --> 01:01:47.657
Too late. He's on the runway.

01:01:48.658 --> 01:01:52.079
Jerry! Stop! Jerry, stop!

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.004
Honey, I'm really sorry.

01:02:01.838 --> 01:02:04.841
I did everything I could
to try to get out of this.

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:07.511
My parents will be here
in less than an hour.

01:02:07.761 --> 01:02:11.515
I'm still peeling potatoes and
a sock's stuck in the garbage disposal.

01:02:11.723 --> 01:02:13.558
I'll take care of it later.

01:02:13.767 --> 01:02:17.062
And I'll be there for dinner,
I promise.

01:02:17.354 --> 01:02:18.647
Can I talk to Mikey?

01:02:18.855 --> 01:02:22.693
Yes. Mike, it's your dad!

01:02:28.281 --> 01:02:30.033
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, Mike.</i>

01:02:30.575 --> 01:02:34.287
I know that you're not feeling
so good right now, but...

01:02:34.496 --> 01:02:35.580
When will you be home?

01:02:36.123 --> 01:02:37.874
I'll be home very soon.

01:02:38.208 --> 01:02:39.418
I want you now.

01:02:39.626 --> 01:02:40.877
I want to be there too.

01:02:41.086 --> 01:02:44.798
Hey, do you think Santa would
keep us apart on Christmas Eve?

01:02:45.257 --> 01:02:47.676
I mean, no way. Right?

01:02:48.635 --> 01:02:50.012
Here's Julie.

01:02:52.723 --> 01:02:53.765
Hi, Daddy.

01:02:54.141 --> 01:02:56.143
<i>- Knock, knock.</i>
- Who's there?

01:02:56.351 --> 01:02:57.519
- Mary.
<i>- Mary who?</i>

01:02:57.728 --> 01:02:59.521
Merry Christmas, Daddy!

01:03:04.401 --> 01:03:06.903
- Hi, Rocks.
<i>- How you doing, kid?</i>

01:03:08.447 --> 01:03:10.657
I'm sorry.
Mom won't let you in the house.

01:03:10.907 --> 01:03:13.744
<i>It's not like I never spent</i>
<i>the night outside before.</i>

01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:18.206
Why'd you have to go
and chew on her shoes?

01:03:18.415 --> 01:03:21.877
<i>It was me, Rocks. I did it.</i>

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:24.421
<i>- I set you up.</i>
<i>- I know.</i>

01:03:25.088 --> 01:03:29.468
<i>But it was before we...</i>
<i>Oh, I'd give anything to take it back.</i>

01:03:29.718 --> 01:03:31.928
Mom says you have to go away.

01:03:32.179 --> 01:03:36.308
<i>It was only a matter of time.</i>
<i>This home stuff was too good to last.</i>

01:03:36.892 --> 01:03:40.062
Mom says someday
I can get another dog.

01:03:40.896 --> 01:03:44.733
But I don't want another dog.
You're my dog.

01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:49.279
<i>It's okay, kid.</i>
<i>I don't belong here.</i>

01:03:49.488 --> 01:03:52.616
<i>You're nice people.</i>
<i>You deserve a classy dog like Daph.</i>

01:03:52.866 --> 01:03:54.534
<i>She's got looks, brains.</i>

01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:56.953
<i>Brains aren't everything.</i>

01:03:58.372 --> 01:04:01.124
<i>I may not be smart,</i>
<i>but I know I'm out of here.</i>

01:04:01.375 --> 01:04:04.711
<i>You are smart. If you'd pay</i>
<i>attention, you could learn...</i>

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.588
<i>... everything they'd want you to.</i>

01:04:06.797 --> 01:04:09.299
<i>What do you mean, tricks?</i>
<i>It's too late.</i>

01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:12.886
<i>Not with America's most</i>
<i>overtrained dog as your teacher.</i>

01:04:23.188 --> 01:04:26.566
- Well, here we are.
- Do you mind if I use the phone?

01:04:26.942 --> 01:04:30.946
Oh, no. There's one downstairs
in the kitchen, to the right.

01:04:45.293 --> 01:04:47.671
This line is dead.
Do you have another line?

01:04:47.921 --> 01:04:52.009
There's a fax machine here.
Oh, what's this?

01:04:52.384 --> 01:04:56.805
It's from Conti. You read it.
I can't see without my glasses.

01:04:58.223 --> 01:05:01.643
"Won't be in until late tonight,
possibly first thing tomorrow.

01:05:01.893 --> 01:05:04.521
Don't leave.
Please make yourself at home."

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:06.481
Oh, man.

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:10.569
- This is dead too.
- Damn!

01:05:10.777 --> 01:05:12.654
I gotta go.
I better stop the driver.

01:05:12.904 --> 01:05:15.157
- He's gone.
- He's gone?

01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:18.744
I can't miss my family's Christmas.

01:05:18.994 --> 01:05:22.247
James, I feel absolutely
ghastly about this.

01:05:22.497 --> 01:05:23.749
Scotch?

01:05:25.375 --> 01:05:28.587
<i>Let's start with something easy.</i>
<i>"Sit" is very popular.</i>

01:05:28.795 --> 01:05:30.547
<i>- You've heard it?</i>
<i>- Sounds familiar.</i>

01:05:30.839 --> 01:05:34.134
<i>Okay. Front paws stiff.</i>
<i>Butt on floor.</i>

01:05:34.343 --> 01:05:36.136
<i>That's all there is to it.</i>

01:05:36.386 --> 01:05:38.513
<i>That's what they've</i>
<i>been babbling about?</i>

01:05:38.764 --> 01:05:42.267
<i>What can I say? It's a power trip.</i>
<i>Uh-oh, busted.</i>

01:05:42.517 --> 01:05:45.771
<i>Hey, kid's mom!</i>
<i>Let's do the "sit" thing.</i>

01:05:45.979 --> 01:05:47.773
<i>Hey, come over here. Ask me.</i>

01:05:49.399 --> 01:05:50.817
What's with you?

01:05:52.152 --> 01:05:53.779
You're being affectionate?

01:05:55.238 --> 01:05:56.448
<i>Try guilty.</i>

01:05:56.698 --> 01:06:00.452
Well, you do have
a sweet side, don't you?

01:06:00.702 --> 01:06:02.079
Yeah.

01:06:02.329 --> 01:06:03.955
<i>Please don't send Rocks away.</i>

01:06:04.206 --> 01:06:08.502
<i>Here! Over here! Look, look, see?</i>
<i>I got this "sit" thing nailed.</i>

01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:11.963
<i>He's decent, loyal.</i>
<i>Everything I'm not.</i>

01:06:12.172 --> 01:06:13.215
What?

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.051
What, do you miss Rocks?

01:06:17.135 --> 01:06:18.387
I thought you hated him.

01:06:18.595 --> 01:06:20.847
<i>Once you get past the fleas,</i>
<i>he's charming.</i>

01:06:21.098 --> 01:06:23.600
That's the way it goes, isn't it?

01:06:23.809 --> 01:06:26.061
First, you think
they're not good enough.

01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:31.483
Then they grow on you,
and then you can't live without them.

01:06:32.401 --> 01:06:34.111
Ain't it the truth.

01:06:40.325 --> 01:06:43.954
Look, I'm just gonna walk into town
and rent a car, okay?

01:06:44.162 --> 01:06:45.789
I'll be home in a few hours.

01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:49.126
Okay, whatever you want to do, but...

01:06:49.376 --> 01:06:52.504
...do you think you ought
to walk 10 miles in that?

01:07:12.024 --> 01:07:15.902
That's him! That's my husband!

01:07:30.834 --> 01:07:35.464
Oh, yeah? Well, a Merry Christmas
to you too, you rude bimbo!

01:07:35.672 --> 01:07:37.424
There's the holiday spirit.

01:07:37.674 --> 01:07:40.761
Samantha's office won't give me
the number where they are.

01:07:41.011 --> 01:07:43.430
They're treating me
like I'm some wacko!

01:07:45.265 --> 01:07:46.558
I know what I'll do.

01:07:46.767 --> 01:07:51.521
I'll call Mr. Conti. I bet his
secretary will tell me where they are.

01:07:58.028 --> 01:08:00.364
Mr. Conti's office.

01:08:01.615 --> 01:08:03.283
What cabin?

01:08:04.743 --> 01:08:07.829
I'm sorry.
There must be some mistake.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.417
Mr. Conti is in the Bahamas
with his family.

01:08:18.881 --> 01:08:22.886
James better hurry.
That bird's ready to come out.

01:08:23.136 --> 01:08:26.807
He doesn't need to hurry, Mother.
He's having an affair.

01:08:27.474 --> 01:08:30.394
- What?
- There is no meeting.

01:08:30.644 --> 01:08:34.022
He and Ms. Fortune 500
are shacked up...

01:08:34.231 --> 01:08:36.024
...in some cabin upstate.

01:08:36.274 --> 01:08:40.569
So while I am here, peeling
thousands of little pearl onions...

01:08:40.821 --> 01:08:44.950
...because he loves them, he's having
an affair on Christmas Eve.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.246
Come on, now.
You don't believe that.

01:08:49.496 --> 01:08:51.832
Well, Mother, what would you believe?

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.210
Sweetie, you remember in the war...

01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:59.256
...when your father's ship was shelled
and he was on that island?

01:08:59.506 --> 01:09:03.635
For 17 days, then he was rescued.
What does that have to do with this?

01:09:03.885 --> 01:09:07.514
What you don't know was
he was on that island alone...

01:09:07.764 --> 01:09:10.600
...with 13 USO girls.

01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:14.145
God forbid, it wasn't Bob Hope.

01:09:14.438 --> 01:09:16.648
Those girls had been
around the block...

01:09:16.898 --> 01:09:21.444
...and remember, your father was
a devastatingly handsome man.

01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:25.032
That's beautiful.

01:09:29.745 --> 01:09:33.040
Go on, Mother. So, what happened?

01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:35.876
Nothing. At least
he swore nothing happened.

01:09:36.084 --> 01:09:38.127
Said they played gin rummy
the whole time.

01:09:38.377 --> 01:09:40.881
- And you believed him?
- Of course not.

01:09:41.131 --> 01:09:42.506
Well, Mother!

01:09:42.716 --> 01:09:45.551
Now, wait.
Later I met some of the girls.

01:09:45.801 --> 01:09:50.265
It turned out that he hadn't
played gin rummy the whole time.

01:09:50.515 --> 01:09:52.517
All he did the whole time...

01:09:52.725 --> 01:09:55.187
...was talk about me.

01:09:55.395 --> 01:09:58.357
And I believed them.

01:10:00.942 --> 01:10:02.944
Now, in your heart...

01:10:03.195 --> 01:10:07.741
...do you really believe that
James would cheat on you?

01:10:20.087 --> 01:10:24.424
Well, James, since we're stuck here,
we might as well relax.

01:10:27.219 --> 01:10:28.261
Isn't it great?

01:10:35.143 --> 01:10:36.478
This isn't good.

01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:37.813
What?

01:10:38.355 --> 01:10:41.191
What is this?
This all seems like some kind of...

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.984
Some sort of what?

01:10:50.158 --> 01:10:52.285
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

01:10:52.536 --> 01:10:55.664
You think I planned this
as some sort of... Oh, God.

01:10:55.872 --> 01:11:00.752
God, I'm wrong! Oh, man! To even
think you'd go for a guy like me!

01:11:01.002 --> 01:11:02.045
Sit down.

01:11:02.254 --> 01:11:06.299
I am so stupid!
You probably have someone like...

01:11:06.508 --> 01:11:09.678
...Prince Charles in a condo,
waiting for you somewhere.

01:11:09.928 --> 01:11:14.516
No. And no, I didn't have
any plans for tonight.

01:11:14.725 --> 01:11:18.478
You're kidding. You were actually
going to be alone for Christmas?

01:11:19.021 --> 01:11:21.398
- I'm used to it.
- I can't believe it.

01:11:21.648 --> 01:11:24.443
When I was little,
I was usually at boarding school.

01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.111
Where were your folks?

01:11:26.445 --> 01:11:30.240
- Oh, I don't know. Skiing.
- Instead of being with their kid?

01:11:31.033 --> 01:11:35.454
Their parents did it to them,
they did it to me. It was fine.

01:11:35.704 --> 01:11:39.708
I also had a lot of advantages.
I went to the best schools.

01:11:39.958 --> 01:11:42.669
I could speak 4 languages
by the time I was 15.

01:11:43.754 --> 01:11:46.381
When I was 15,
I was flunking English.

01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:49.134
I suppose I did wonder about...

01:11:49.384 --> 01:11:53.263
Well, you know,
regular high school. Boys.

01:11:54.181 --> 01:11:57.434
- Dances. That kind of thing.
- You didn't go to dances?

01:11:57.642 --> 01:12:01.188
No. If I'm really honest,
I actually don't know how.

01:12:01.396 --> 01:12:03.273
Come on. Everybody can dance.

01:12:03.482 --> 01:12:05.400
- Everybody cannot dance!
- They can.

01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:08.028
- No, they cannot!
- It's easy.

01:12:12.908 --> 01:12:14.159
What's wrong?

01:12:14.451 --> 01:12:15.494
Nothing.

01:12:15.702 --> 01:12:17.287
He's not coming, is he?

01:12:17.746 --> 01:12:20.791
Oh, honey, he's trying real hard
to get back tonight.

01:12:21.291 --> 01:12:23.335
I knew it. He's not coming back.

01:12:23.585 --> 01:12:27.881
Let's go and open some of the gifts
that Grandma and Grandpa brought.

01:12:28.090 --> 01:12:29.841
I'm sure Santa wouldn't mind.

01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:32.052
- There is no Santa!
- What?

01:12:32.636 --> 01:12:34.346
There is no Santa.

01:12:34.596 --> 01:12:35.889
Now, you stop that!

01:12:36.098 --> 01:12:39.351
If there was, wouldn't he
let Daddy be with us?

01:12:39.851 --> 01:12:43.563
- What's wrong? Where's Daddy?
- Oh, sweetie!

01:12:43.814 --> 01:12:45.816
I want my daddy.

01:12:46.066 --> 01:12:47.442
Christmas stinks.

01:12:47.693 --> 01:12:50.696
Everybody just hold it!
I think I have an idea.

01:12:51.071 --> 01:12:55.242
Let's open some presents.
Look what's in this. Open this one.

01:12:55.492 --> 01:12:57.452
- I don't want one.
- I'll have it.

01:12:57.661 --> 01:12:59.579
Ms. D'Bonne's office, please.

01:13:01.206 --> 01:13:04.918
Hello. I am calling
from Olympic Florist...

01:13:05.168 --> 01:13:08.547
...and I have 350 red
long-stemmed roses...

01:13:08.797 --> 01:13:10.799
...to deliver to Ms. D'Bonne.

01:13:11.299 --> 01:13:13.135
I need the address, please.

01:13:13.427 --> 01:13:15.220
They're coming from a Mr...

01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:18.807
...James Ubriacco, Ubri...

01:13:19.057 --> 01:13:22.310
Yeah, doll, that's it. That's it.

01:13:25.814 --> 01:13:29.192
Good. Thanks, doll.
And a Merry Christmas to you too.

01:13:29.401 --> 01:13:30.736
Sucker.

01:13:31.278 --> 01:13:33.989
Kids, listen to Mommy.
Go in your rooms...

01:13:34.197 --> 01:13:36.908
...and put on warm clothes.
We're taking a trip.

01:13:37.159 --> 01:13:39.619
Daddy, will you
put the presents in the car?

01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:44.624
Ma, will you put the onions in some
Tupperware? Come on, let's move it!

01:13:44.875 --> 01:13:49.421
Go! Daddy won't come to Christmas,
Christmas will come to Daddy.

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.437
<i>Rocks, I don't feel so good.</i>

01:14:05.645 --> 01:14:08.690
<i>It's fun. It's chasing</i>
<i>without the stupid running.</i>

01:14:08.899 --> 01:14:11.276
<i>I'm going to lose my Kibbles 'n Bits.</i>

01:14:19.326 --> 01:14:20.577
<i>What's this?</i>

01:14:20.952 --> 01:14:24.289
Touch a present and you'll be
hunting gophers for dinner.

01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:39.846
<i>I smell fruitcake!</i>

01:14:40.097 --> 01:14:42.599
<i>- That's gotta be fruitcake.</i>
- Rocks, I said no!

01:14:43.308 --> 01:14:45.185
Mom. Mom, look out!

01:14:52.651 --> 01:14:54.528
Don't worry. Mommy's just playing.

01:14:57.239 --> 01:14:58.865
Hang on!

01:15:02.661 --> 01:15:03.704
<i>Stop this thing!</i>

01:15:15.424 --> 01:15:17.801
Are you okay?
Are you okay, honey?

01:15:18.135 --> 01:15:19.302
Is everybody okay?

01:15:19.553 --> 01:15:23.056
All right, good.
Now, wasn't that fun?

01:15:23.306 --> 01:15:24.516
No.

01:15:24.766 --> 01:15:26.101
No. All right.

01:15:26.476 --> 01:15:30.355
Okay. Well, tell you
what we're gonna do.

01:15:30.856 --> 01:15:33.734
Mommy's gonna figure out
how to get us out of here.

01:15:34.693 --> 01:15:36.445
- I got an idea.
- What?

01:15:36.737 --> 01:15:38.697
You push and I drive.

01:15:38.947 --> 01:15:42.117
Really? Good. You have
your driver's license with you?

01:15:42.909 --> 01:15:43.744
No.

01:15:43.952 --> 01:15:46.955
Okay, good try.
I know. I have an idea.

01:15:47.205 --> 01:15:51.668
Look, there's lots of pine cones here.
I'm gonna gather some up for us.

01:15:51.918 --> 01:15:54.546
- And while I do that...
- I don't like pine cones.

01:15:54.796 --> 01:15:56.423
Oh, you don't?

01:15:57.007 --> 01:15:59.676
Well, okay,
then I will get you a stick.

01:15:59.926 --> 01:16:03.096
And then you guys sing
and guard the presents, okay?

01:16:03.347 --> 01:16:06.850
So sing a nice loud Christmas song
so Mommy can hear you.

01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:23.950
Now what am I gonna do?

01:16:32.042 --> 01:16:34.836
Will you stop messing me up!

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:56.775
<i>Meals on wheels.</i>

01:16:57.067 --> 01:16:59.319
Mommy found another doggie.

01:16:59.528 --> 01:17:00.654
<i>That's no dog.</i>

01:17:00.904 --> 01:17:03.407
<i>Hey, mama,</i>
<i>on your way to Grandma's house?</i>

01:17:04.783 --> 01:17:06.493
<i>Hey, you! Beat it!</i>

01:17:09.621 --> 01:17:12.290
<i>Ooh, I love the smell of fear.</i>

01:17:12.499 --> 01:17:14.209
Nice wolf.

01:17:15.419 --> 01:17:17.129
I won't hurt you.

01:17:19.631 --> 01:17:20.882
Nice wolf.

01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:24.553
I like wolves.

01:17:28.974 --> 01:17:31.018
<i>Let me out of here! Let me out!</i>

01:17:31.226 --> 01:17:32.060
Nice wolf.

01:17:33.979 --> 01:17:35.355
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

01:17:40.318 --> 01:17:44.656
<i>Just leave the lady alone, unless</i>
<i>you want to get spayed the hard way.</i>

01:17:45.282 --> 01:17:48.869
<i>He talks the talk,</i>
<i>but can he walk the walk?</i>

01:17:50.912 --> 01:17:53.206
<i>Back off, this ain't your business.</i>

01:17:53.457 --> 01:17:55.709
<i>The hell it ain't.</i>
<i>That's my family.</i>

01:17:55.959 --> 01:17:59.671
Remember when Mommy told you
the story about Peter and the wolf?

01:17:59.921 --> 01:18:04.885
Well, there's the wolf. Where is
that crazy Peter when you need him?

01:18:18.231 --> 01:18:19.858
Rocks!

01:18:46.927 --> 01:18:49.054
<i>Rocks! Oh, no! No!</i>

01:18:53.850 --> 01:18:55.102
<i>Rip his throat out!</i>

01:18:57.479 --> 01:18:59.773
<i>Ow! My tail!</i>

01:19:00.190 --> 01:19:03.235
<i>Never mess with</i>
<i>a street dog, you wuss.</i>

01:19:14.371 --> 01:19:17.541
<i>Rocks, you're hurt!</i>
<i>Look at your paws and your ears.</i>

01:19:17.749 --> 01:19:21.420
<i>Your little ears. And your neck.</i>
<i>What did that animal do to you?</i>

01:19:21.628 --> 01:19:23.505
<i>- It's nothing.</i>
<i>- Oh, sweetheart.</i>

01:19:23.714 --> 01:19:26.091
<i>Sweetheart? Oh, baby!</i>

01:19:29.594 --> 01:19:31.847
<i>Hey, I smell kid's dad.</i>
<i>Up this way.</i>

01:19:32.097 --> 01:19:33.223
<i>The master?</i>

01:19:33.432 --> 01:19:35.809
<i>But you're hurt.</i>
<i>Come back to the car.</i>

01:19:36.018 --> 01:19:38.770
<i>- We gotta get them help.</i>
<i>- Then I'm going too.</i>

01:19:39.021 --> 01:19:42.274
<i>- No, you're a house dog.</i>
<i>- I've still got my animal instincts.</i>

01:19:42.524 --> 01:19:44.901
<i>All right. Go back</i>
<i>that way and get help.</i>

01:19:45.152 --> 01:19:47.696
<i>All right. Which way?</i>

01:19:47.904 --> 01:19:50.866
<i>- You gotta sniff for people.</i>
<i>- Sniff?</i>

01:19:51.116 --> 01:19:53.577
<i>- Stick your nose in the air and suck.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

01:19:53.785 --> 01:19:57.080
Mommy's gotta go get the dogs
before they run away.

01:19:57.622 --> 01:20:01.043
<i>- Take care of yourself.</i>
<i>- Don't worry about me.</i>

01:20:01.501 --> 01:20:03.170
Sniff. No, that's snort.

01:20:05.172 --> 01:20:07.090
Rocks! Here, boy!

01:20:07.341 --> 01:20:08.592
Come on, guys!

01:20:08.842 --> 01:20:10.000
- Where'd they go?
- Daphne! Here, girl!

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.470
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
- Where'd they go?
- Daphne! Here, girl!

01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:11.678
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:11.678 --> 01:20:13.597
Maybe they went to the bathroom.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:13.597 --> 01:20:13.847
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:13.847 --> 01:20:17.309
They should have gone to
the bathroom before we left, right?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:17.309 --> 01:20:17.517
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:17.517 --> 01:20:18.977
That's right.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:19.478 --> 01:20:20.854
Rocks, come back!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:21.104 --> 01:20:22.000
- Daphne!
- Let's get back in the car.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.774
- Daphne!
- Let's get back in the car.

01:20:24.024 --> 01:20:25.901
- He'll come back.
- Come back, girl.

01:20:26.151 --> 01:20:29.237
I'll let you open a present.
Whichever one you want.

01:20:29.488 --> 01:20:31.073
But Rocks is hurt!

01:20:31.323 --> 01:20:34.076
Honey, he'll be fine.

01:20:34.451 --> 01:20:36.370
Six, seven...

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:38.413
...eight and slow.

01:20:38.663 --> 01:20:40.499
Quick, quick, slow.

01:20:40.749 --> 01:20:42.584
Quick, quick, slow.

01:20:46.171 --> 01:20:49.091
Good. Quick, quick, slow. Good.

01:20:51.176 --> 01:20:53.595
Excellent. Good.

01:21:07.234 --> 01:21:10.112
- See, you can dance.
- But how do we do it like this?

01:21:10.362 --> 01:21:13.198
Well, you just do it the same way.

01:21:13.657 --> 01:21:14.491
Slow.

01:21:14.741 --> 01:21:16.868
Quick, quick, slow.

01:21:17.119 --> 01:21:19.121
Quick, quick, slow.

01:21:21.456 --> 01:21:25.293
<i>I think I'm sniffing.</i>
<i>I'm inhaling and I'm getting nothing.</i>

01:21:25.544 --> 01:21:28.922
<i>I'm just an inbred washout.</i>
<i>I can't even smell... People!</i>

01:21:31.842 --> 01:21:32.718
<i>I did it!</i>

01:21:32.968 --> 01:21:37.014
<i>I can sniff! I am not a poodle,</i>
<i>I am a wild, marauding beast!</i>

01:21:38.598 --> 01:21:40.726
<i>Move it! My masters need help.</i>

01:22:01.997 --> 01:22:04.833
The phone is out, huh?
You are unbelievable.

01:22:05.083 --> 01:22:07.210
How dare you treat me like that?

01:22:07.419 --> 01:22:09.713
Easy. You're a lousy human being.

01:22:12.424 --> 01:22:17.220
Listen to me, James.
You are a very impressive man.

01:22:17.471 --> 01:22:20.349
Over the past few months,
I have watched you bloom.

01:22:20.557 --> 01:22:22.684
You deserve better than some...

01:22:22.934 --> 01:22:26.021
...frumpy housewife who doesn't
have the resourcefulness...

01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:28.231
...to find herself a decent job.

01:22:30.776 --> 01:22:33.737
She's smart enough to find me here.
That's our dog!

01:22:38.075 --> 01:22:42.371
- Hey, Rocks. All right.
<i>- Hey, big guy. Hey, pal, give me paw.</i>

01:22:42.621 --> 01:22:45.624
- What happened?
<i>- Not so rough.</i>

01:22:45.832 --> 01:22:48.251
<i>Whoa! Is she in heat, or what?</i>

01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:55.717
If you walk out that door,
I will personally guarantee...

01:22:55.926 --> 01:22:57.427
...that you never fly...

01:22:57.636 --> 01:23:01.431
...for a reputable company
for the rest of your pathetic...

01:23:03.517 --> 01:23:06.770
<i>How do you like that?</i>
<i>That'll cool you off.</i>

01:23:08.563 --> 01:23:09.690
Rocks, let's go.

01:23:09.898 --> 01:23:11.274
<i>Good shot, huh?</i>

01:23:13.235 --> 01:23:14.361
Bye.

01:23:20.575 --> 01:23:22.202
It's a hat.

01:23:22.452 --> 01:23:25.414
It's a hat. Let's put it on.

01:23:26.456 --> 01:23:28.166
I think it goes a different way.

01:23:28.625 --> 01:23:32.087
Let's see. You look so pretty!

01:23:33.422 --> 01:23:37.884
Look at that face!
Mikey, you want to open another one?

01:23:38.844 --> 01:23:40.554
It's probably more clothes.

01:23:40.804 --> 01:23:43.140
You're lucky we gave you
some boring things.

01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:46.685
Otherwise, you'd be freezing
your tushy off right now.

01:23:52.065 --> 01:23:53.775
Is that Daphne?

01:23:56.695 --> 01:24:00.282
My God! My dog is a genius!

01:24:00.532 --> 01:24:02.284
Way to go, Daphne!

01:24:02.534 --> 01:24:05.662
<i>No need for applause.</i>
<i>Just throw treats.</i>

01:24:06.204 --> 01:24:08.165
<i>Come on, we're almost there.</i>

01:24:09.458 --> 01:24:12.627
Okay, Rocks, where are they?
Are we getting close?

01:24:13.170 --> 01:24:15.422
Are we? Right.

01:24:15.630 --> 01:24:18.216
What are you gonna say?
"They're just up the road...

01:24:18.467 --> 01:24:21.303
...about a quarter of a mile,
just past the 7-11."

01:24:22.637 --> 01:24:23.680
This way.

01:24:23.889 --> 01:24:28.518
<i>Are you gonna trust that dinky bulb</i>
<i>on your face or my nose? Come on!</i>

01:24:28.727 --> 01:24:31.104
All right. I hope you're right.

01:24:37.194 --> 01:24:40.280
Mollie! Mollie!

01:24:41.573 --> 01:24:44.242
Oh, God. Mollie!

01:24:45.786 --> 01:24:47.621
<i>They're gone? I can't believe it.</i>

01:24:47.871 --> 01:24:50.832
<i>Look on the floor. They were here.</i>
<i>I left them here.</i>

01:25:04.429 --> 01:25:05.722
Come on in.

01:25:08.725 --> 01:25:11.561
There are some cots
in the back you could use.

01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:15.941
No, thank you. We can't sleep here.
We have to find my husband tonight.

01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:17.901
No one's going anywhere tonight.

01:25:18.318 --> 01:25:21.405
You hunker down here.
We'll go out in the morning.

01:25:21.655 --> 01:25:24.366
We have to go.
This is Christmas Eve. We've gotta...

01:25:24.574 --> 01:25:25.742
I'm sorry.

01:25:27.077 --> 01:25:29.871
If it's any consolation,
I have cookies and eggnog.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.873
You can help yourselves.

01:25:33.208 --> 01:25:34.501
Thank you.

01:25:49.975 --> 01:25:52.060
I'm sorry, you guys.

01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:55.689
I didn't mean to get us stuck
out in the middle of nowhere...

01:25:55.939 --> 01:25:57.983
...without our daddy. Sorry.

01:25:58.358 --> 01:26:01.111
How's Santa gonna find us here?

01:26:03.572 --> 01:26:06.408
Don't worry, he has special radar.

01:26:14.708 --> 01:26:18.086
- Merry Christmas, Mom.
- Merry Christmas, Mom.

01:26:18.754 --> 01:26:20.380
Merry Christmas.

01:26:32.893 --> 01:26:35.479
<i>- He was big and he jumped me.</i>
<i>- We'll find him.</i>

01:26:36.104 --> 01:26:39.358
<i>Wait, wait. I think</i>
<i>I'm picking up on something here.</i>

01:26:40.442 --> 01:26:42.361
<i>Fresh meat, fresh meat, fresh meat.</i>

01:26:49.826 --> 01:26:51.661
<i>Yeah, that's the guy.</i>

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.205
<i>Damn.</i>

01:26:53.413 --> 01:26:54.831
<i>- He bit me.</i>
<i>- He ain't so big.</i>

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.083
<i>He had friends.</i>

01:26:56.291 --> 01:26:58.251
<i>The fur's gonna fly.</i>

01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.462
<i>Run! I'll take care of these guys.</i>

01:27:00.879 --> 01:27:02.839
<i>You take care of nobody, chump.</i>

01:27:04.758 --> 01:27:05.801
<i>It's showtime.</i>

01:27:06.009 --> 01:27:07.594
<i>- Your funeral.</i>
<i>- Your mama.</i>

01:27:08.595 --> 01:27:09.638
<i>Kill!</i>

01:27:27.322 --> 01:27:29.533
Honey, let's go to bed now.

01:27:29.783 --> 01:27:32.953
- I'm not sleepy.
- I know.

01:27:33.203 --> 01:27:34.663
But you know what?

01:27:34.913 --> 01:27:39.001
The sooner we go to sleep,
the sooner Christmas will come.

01:27:58.145 --> 01:27:59.646
Santa?

01:28:16.204 --> 01:28:17.372
Mom.

01:28:17.998 --> 01:28:20.292
Come over here. Look.

01:28:20.584 --> 01:28:22.586
I think it's Santa.

01:28:33.638 --> 01:28:34.723
Hello?

01:28:39.519 --> 01:28:40.562
Man.

01:28:40.937 --> 01:28:43.148
Merry Christmas, honey.

01:28:52.866 --> 01:28:54.493
Daddy!

01:28:54.785 --> 01:28:56.953
- Daddy!
- Hi, Julie.

01:29:05.212 --> 01:29:06.797
Where's Rocks?

01:29:07.047 --> 01:29:10.759
You wouldn't believe it.
We ran into these wolves, right?

01:29:11.009 --> 01:29:13.011
We actually got attacked by wolves.

01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:16.390
<i>- Oh, no.</i>
- And Rocks came to my defence.

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.352
And one of the wolves chomped
on my beeper. Look at it.

01:29:20.811 --> 01:29:24.940
<i>And they all totally spazzed out.</i>
<i>Bunch of wimps.</i>

01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:29.528
<i>Hey, kid, it's great to see you.</i>

01:29:30.862 --> 01:29:33.198
<i>Oh, Rocks! How did you find us?</i>

01:29:33.407 --> 01:29:35.575
<i>I just followed your scent.</i>

01:29:36.326 --> 01:29:39.079
<i>And you smell beautiful, Daphne.</i>
<i>Oh, honey pie!</i>

01:29:39.287 --> 01:29:42.374
<i>- Pumpkin butt.</i>
<i>- Not in front of the kids.</i>

01:29:42.708 --> 01:29:46.628
And, James, before the wolves...

01:29:47.129 --> 01:29:48.255
...what were you doing?

01:29:49.423 --> 01:29:51.008
Getting fired.

01:29:53.719 --> 01:29:55.220
Thank God!

01:29:57.305 --> 01:29:59.224
Mom, can Rocks stay with us now?

01:30:00.434 --> 01:30:02.686
Honey, have a heart.

01:30:02.894 --> 01:30:05.480
If not for Rocks,
we wouldn't be here together.

01:30:05.814 --> 01:30:08.859
- I mean, I might even be dead.
- I know! That's why...

01:30:09.067 --> 01:30:11.862
So, what if he's not
the smartest dog in the world?

01:30:12.112 --> 01:30:14.197
Who cares if he can sit down?

01:30:14.406 --> 01:30:15.449
<i>I can sit down.</i>

01:30:15.657 --> 01:30:19.036
- Or if he can beg.
<i>- Beg? Beg's easy. Look.</i>

01:30:19.244 --> 01:30:22.748
Who needs a beggar in the family?
Or lie down?

01:30:22.998 --> 01:30:25.959
I mean, the point is,
he is still a great dog.

01:30:26.543 --> 01:30:27.753
He stays.

01:30:28.003 --> 01:30:28.962
- What?
- He stays.

01:30:29.212 --> 01:30:30.464
Really?

01:30:30.672 --> 01:30:32.466
Hey, Mike, did you hear that?

01:30:34.051 --> 01:30:35.469
<i>I'm gonna stay!</i>

01:30:35.719 --> 01:30:37.095
Hey, guys?

01:30:38.221 --> 01:30:40.432
I'm picking up
something weird over here.

01:30:48.607 --> 01:30:51.276
Hey, what is that? Come here.

01:30:52.527 --> 01:30:54.654
Is that sleigh bells?

01:30:56.656 --> 01:31:00.118
<i>Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!</i>

01:31:02.162 --> 01:31:04.539
- I told you he was real.
- I knew that.

01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:06.291
- You did not.
- I always knew.

01:31:06.541 --> 01:31:08.210
- You did not.
- Did too.

01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:11.463
- She kissed you!
- I hate my sister.

01:31:11.672 --> 01:31:13.840
- Get the cootie spray!
- Let's go to bed.

01:31:14.091 --> 01:31:17.177
- I don't want to go to bed.
- This is so exciting!

01:31:17.386 --> 01:31:21.723
<i>Santa's right outside. He's right</i>
<i>above our head. Can't you hear it?</i>

01:35:02.819 --> 01:35:03.862
