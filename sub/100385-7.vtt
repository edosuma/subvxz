WEBVTT

00:10.547 --> 00:12.714
(theme music plays)

00:18.839 --> 00:21.297
-Yeah! Whoa!
-Carl: Fuck, yeah!

00:21.381 --> 00:22.923
-Yeah!
-Lewis! We did it, baby.

00:23.005 --> 00:25.798
-Five hundred big ones.
-Richard: Yeah. Hey, hey, hey.

00:25.881 --> 00:27.756
-Larry: Here you go, Carl.
Enjoy.
-Thank you.

00:27.839 --> 00:29.673
-Great game. Great game.
Great game.
-All right, buddy.

00:29.756 --> 00:31.631
-Take care of yourself.
-Do you believe we lost to them?

00:31.714 --> 00:32.923
-No.
-It's unbelievable.

00:33.005 --> 00:34.673
Uh, we'll get your car
right away, Mr. David.

00:34.756 --> 00:36.297
What a day on the links, huh?

00:36.381 --> 00:38.506
I've never seen him
play like that before.
That was amazing.

00:38.589 --> 00:40.506
-Richard: I'm on a roll.
-Yes, you putted
extraordinarily well.

00:40.589 --> 00:42.631
I have some magic touch lately.
I don't know what it is.

00:42.714 --> 00:44.673
And I had a great partner.
You were good. Don't--

00:44.756 --> 00:46.464
All right,
we'll buy lunch.
All right?

00:46.547 --> 00:48.422
-Yeah, we'll buy lunch.
Where do you wanna eat?
-Oh, boy. What sport.

00:48.506 --> 00:50.839
-You made $500 each.
-Yeah, you win $500,

00:50.923 --> 00:52.255
and you're gonna
buy us lunch.

00:52.339 --> 00:53.839
-Oh, you're, you're great guys.
-So name the restaurant.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.047
Wherever you wanna go.

00:55.130 --> 00:56.798
-Let's go to Tiato's.
-Tiato's.

00:56.881 --> 00:58.422
Yeah. I've heard
good things about it.

00:58.506 --> 00:59.798
Hey, I'm in a great mood.

00:59.881 --> 01:01.297
Wherever you wanna go,
we'll go, all right?

01:01.381 --> 01:03.005
-Jeff: You better
enjoy my money.
-I'm starving.

01:03.089 --> 01:05.464
-Okay, I'll see you
at the restaurant.
-Wha-- What is this?

01:05.547 --> 01:07.381
-My new car.
-You bought a Bentley?

01:07.464 --> 01:09.172
-I been, I been a--
-I've never met anyone
who owned a Bentley.

01:09.255 --> 01:11.422
People--
They'll follow you home
and, and kill you.

01:11.506 --> 01:13.714
-Yeah. Much safer
in a Subaru Outback.
-And take your car.

01:13.798 --> 01:16.172
All right, you're a little
jealous of the Bentley,
aren't you.

01:16.255 --> 01:17.881
-I'm not jealous, I'm concerned.
-I'm not jealous.

01:17.964 --> 01:19.464
-I'll see you at
the restaurant, losers.
-Yeah.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.047
He never missed a putt
the whole day.

01:21.130 --> 01:22.673
Not one putt.

01:22.756 --> 01:24.255
Ah, just a lucky day.

01:24.339 --> 01:26.506
Carl:
That is odd, isn't it?

01:26.589 --> 01:28.923
Jeff: I don't know.
No more than once a week.

01:29.005 --> 01:31.214
Really?
Cheryl and I had sex
four times a week.

01:31.297 --> 01:32.631
-You did?
-Richard: Really?

01:32.714 --> 01:34.381
-Yeah.
-You know, me and Veronica,

01:34.464 --> 01:36.089
once a week, too,
which is a shame,

01:36.172 --> 01:38.214
'cause she's got this...

01:38.297 --> 01:40.798
she got this...
she's got this magical vagina.

01:40.881 --> 01:44.214
-Huh? What the hell are you
talking about?
-Huh? What does that mean?

01:44.297 --> 01:46.130
I can't really explain it.
But I've never seen anything

01:46.214 --> 01:49.381
or felt anything like this.
There's just something...

01:49.464 --> 01:51.673
supernatural.
It's just magic.
Just, you know what?

01:51.756 --> 01:53.047
Forget it.
It doesn't matter.

01:53.130 --> 01:54.756
Forget it?
You expect me to forget it?

01:54.839 --> 01:57.089
I'm sorry I brought it up.
I, I, I, I don't wanna
talk about it.

01:57.172 --> 01:59.047
No, don't be sorry.
We're not gonna say anything.

01:59.130 --> 02:01.756
It just kind of...
It's like this little
hummingbird nest.

02:01.839 --> 02:03.923
It's got this
mind of its own.
It's just alive.

02:04.005 --> 02:05.756
-A mind of its own.
-Carl: Yeah.
You could say that.

02:05.839 --> 02:08.172
-Holy shit.
-Jeff: Never heard
such a thing.

02:08.255 --> 02:10.297
-(phone dings)
-Jeff: Yeah.

02:10.381 --> 02:12.297
-Holy shit. Really?
-(Richard laughing)

02:12.381 --> 02:13.881
-Jeff: What's the matter?
-Holy fuck.

02:13.964 --> 02:15.422
Le'Veon Bell,
out for the season.

02:15.506 --> 02:16.881
You know how much money
the Jets paid for this guy?

02:16.964 --> 02:18.381
You have any idea
of how much the Jets
paid for him?

02:18.464 --> 02:19.464
He's out for the whole
goddamned season.

02:19.547 --> 02:20.964
-Really?
-Season's over,

02:21.047 --> 02:22.214
before it even started.

02:22.297 --> 02:24.255
Richard:
Please. Just...
Carl. Carl.

02:24.339 --> 02:25.881
This is just football--

02:25.964 --> 02:28.255
-It's not just football!
It's not just football.
-Hey, hey, hey.

02:28.339 --> 02:29.589
Jeff:
What is wrong with you?

02:29.673 --> 02:30.964
Patriots walk all over
everybody. It's over.

02:31.047 --> 02:33.422
Carl, come on.
Settle down, man.
Honestly.

02:33.506 --> 02:35.673
-It's too much.
-Richard: There's more to life.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.964
The three of you,
just eat your food and shut up.
Leave me alone.

02:38.047 --> 02:39.589
Jeff:
You say this over and over.

02:39.673 --> 02:41.005
What are your expectations?

02:41.089 --> 02:42.964
You're talking about them
like they're the Patriots,

02:43.047 --> 02:44.673
and then they're
suddenly cursed.

02:44.756 --> 02:46.589
They're terrible,
year in and year out.

02:46.673 --> 02:48.839
And you beat yourself up,
and it makes me sad.

02:48.923 --> 02:50.255
Well, why do you
take it on personally?

02:50.339 --> 02:51.714
You're not
the general manager.

02:51.798 --> 02:54.005
-Carl: Just doesn't stop.
-Richard: Like a mob movie.

02:54.089 --> 02:55.839
-Jeff: What's going on?
-Huh.

02:55.923 --> 02:58.130
-Jeff: What, you--
-I don't know. Something strange
going on in this restaurant.

02:58.214 --> 03:00.714
-Jeff: Tell me.
-Am I crazy...

03:01.464 --> 03:05.339
or is everyone
in that section
way better looking

03:05.422 --> 03:08.172
than the people
in this section.
Look. Look around.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.339
Jeff:
You are not imagining things.

03:10.422 --> 03:12.005
Larry:
And now look here.
It's like there's

03:12.089 --> 03:13.881
a good-looking section
and an ugly section.

03:13.964 --> 03:16.005
You think it's random?
Why would they do something
like that?

03:16.089 --> 03:18.506
It just seems, it's,
it can't be a coincidence.

03:18.589 --> 03:21.172
I'd like to come here again
without you guys.

03:21.255 --> 03:22.547
You know, who knows?
Maybe if I

03:22.631 --> 03:24.214
came here by myself,
I wouldn't be sitting here.

03:24.297 --> 03:25.881
Why do you think
you shouldn't be here?

03:25.964 --> 03:27.381
'Cause I know I should be
in that section.

03:27.464 --> 03:29.881
You look like
Einstein's gardener,
for Christ's sake.

03:29.964 --> 03:31.381
You're never
gonna get in there.

03:31.464 --> 03:32.881
So who wants to bet?
You wanna bet?

03:32.964 --> 03:35.005
If I come with you,
I bet they keep you here,

03:35.089 --> 03:36.756
-and they move me over there.
-Oh, yeah. Right.

03:36.839 --> 03:39.506
-What are you talking about?
-Are you the reason
we're over here?

03:39.589 --> 03:41.297
Yeah, I'm the dog
in the group.

03:41.381 --> 03:42.714
All I know is,
somebody at this table

03:42.798 --> 03:44.339
prevented us from
sitting over there

03:44.422 --> 03:45.673
and I think
you know who it is.

03:45.756 --> 03:47.214
Oh, I do know who that is.

03:47.297 --> 03:48.381
Oh, I know who it is.

03:48.464 --> 03:50.839
-Oh. Excuse me.
-Yes.

03:50.923 --> 03:52.964
How are you enjoying
everything at Tiato?

03:53.047 --> 03:54.964
-Delicious. It was delicious.
-Manager: Wonderful.

03:55.047 --> 03:56.089
Oh, I'm so happy to hear.

03:56.172 --> 03:57.798
I couldn't help but notice

03:57.881 --> 03:59.881
that the people
sitting on that side

03:59.964 --> 04:01.714
seem to be way better looking

04:01.798 --> 04:04.506
than the people
sitting on this side.

04:04.589 --> 04:07.214
-I have no idea
what you're talking about.
-Larry: You know what I think?

04:07.297 --> 04:09.089
-You have a
good-looking section.
-Manager: Uh-huh.

04:09.172 --> 04:11.047
And you have
an ugly section.

04:11.130 --> 04:12.214
Why would be we do that?

04:12.297 --> 04:14.047
I don't know. Why would you?
You tell me.

04:14.130 --> 04:16.589
I can't tell you, because
there's no truth to it.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.589
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

04:18.673 --> 04:20.339
â™ª

04:21.464 --> 04:23.589
Good day, sir. How are you?

04:23.673 --> 04:26.381
(chuckles):
Oh, my God.

04:26.464 --> 04:28.506
Oh, geez.

04:30.172 --> 04:32.798
I don't mean
to be rude, but...

04:34.464 --> 04:37.255
Would you mind
just leaving for a...

04:37.339 --> 04:39.547
-a couple of minutes?
-Leave?

04:39.631 --> 04:41.089
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, I'm serious.

04:41.172 --> 04:42.589
I got a big job to do,
and, and...

04:42.673 --> 04:45.297
And I can't do my job,
if you're doing your job.

04:45.381 --> 04:46.923
No, I'll be quiet.
No problem.

04:47.005 --> 04:49.547
No, it's not a question of that.
You're here.

04:49.631 --> 04:51.673
I need privacy.
I need distance.

04:51.756 --> 04:53.130
I need to be alone.

04:53.214 --> 04:54.673
Eh, my boss.

04:54.756 --> 04:56.589
I'll get in a lot of trouble.
You know what I mean?

04:56.673 --> 04:58.756
What's the trouble?
You, you, you stepped

04:58.839 --> 05:00.798
outside the room for a minute.
So what?

05:00.881 --> 05:03.339
People need me
here to, you know,
take care of business.

05:03.422 --> 05:05.130
No, no, they don't
need you here.

05:05.214 --> 05:06.964
This is not a job
for human beings,

05:07.047 --> 05:08.339
to be here when other people

05:08.422 --> 05:10.589
are going to the bathroom.
Nobody wants you here!

05:10.673 --> 05:12.798
Everybody's disappointed
when they walk in here.

05:12.881 --> 05:15.422
They don't want to see you,
I'm sorry to say.

05:15.506 --> 05:17.798
With all due respect,
people come in here
with bad breath.

05:17.881 --> 05:19.964
I got, I got mouthwash.
People come in here,

05:20.047 --> 05:22.297
you know, look,
I need a little spruce-up.
I got cologne here.

05:22.381 --> 05:24.798
They would gladly
sacrifice the gum,

05:24.881 --> 05:26.464
the cologne, the mints,

05:26.547 --> 05:28.798
anything you have here,
for some privacy.

05:28.881 --> 05:30.964
They would.
They'd sacrifice it in a second.

05:31.047 --> 05:33.506
-People, I have a purpose here.
-When an animal goes to die,

05:33.589 --> 05:35.798
it leaves the pack.
That's what needs
to happen here.

05:35.881 --> 05:37.381
I need to be alone.

05:37.464 --> 05:38.964
I'm a dying animal.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.756
-I don't know what to tell you.
-Okay, look. Look.

05:41.839 --> 05:46.839
I'll give you 20 bucks for you
to leave this room right now.

05:46.923 --> 05:48.172
And I'll tell you what,

05:48.255 --> 05:50.172
I'm opening up
a coffee shop, okay?
Latte Larry's.

05:50.255 --> 05:52.839
I'll give you
a free cup of coffee
and a scone for a week.

05:52.923 --> 05:54.631
-Okay?
-I've seen the signs for that.

05:54.714 --> 05:56.673
-Yeah, all right. Well, that's
what I'm prepared to offer you.
-All right.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.798
-Yeah, well,
make it quick, please.
-Yeah. Make it quick.

05:58.881 --> 06:01.381
Yeah. I'll, I'll,
I'll do what I can.

06:03.172 --> 06:06.673
Sam Winokur.
You know I know your dad, right?

06:06.756 --> 06:08.255
-Yeah.
-From, from the golf club.

06:08.339 --> 06:11.255
-He told me you're
his favorite patient.
-Oh, well. Yeah.

06:11.339 --> 06:13.005
Um... so.

06:13.089 --> 06:15.297
-You wanna work here part time?
-I do.

06:15.381 --> 06:16.673
-You drink coffee?
-Yeah.

06:16.756 --> 06:18.130
-You make it yourself?
-Yeah.

06:18.214 --> 06:20.089
We have a coffee maker
at the house.
Grind up the beans.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.339
Do you know what a latte is?

06:21.422 --> 06:23.631
The latte is just espresso
and steamed milk.

06:23.714 --> 06:24.881
Kid know his shit.

06:24.964 --> 06:27.714
Okay. Do you know what
milk consideration is?

06:27.798 --> 06:29.255
I'm afraid I don't. No.

06:29.339 --> 06:30.589
You pour too much coffee
in a cup,

06:30.673 --> 06:32.172
you're not leaving room
for the milk.

06:32.255 --> 06:33.714
'Cause then it's,
you have it spilling
over the top.

06:33.798 --> 06:34.964
-Yeah. Exactly.
-Right.

06:35.047 --> 06:36.339
Have you ever dealt
with the public before,

06:36.422 --> 06:37.881
-in any way?
-Well, at my dad's office,

06:37.964 --> 06:39.798
-I mean, you have dozens
of new patients a day.
-(scoffs)

06:39.881 --> 06:42.381
-You know, all different--
-Yeah, no. That's not what
I'm talking about.

06:42.464 --> 06:44.547
-No?
-The people who go
to your dad's office,

06:44.631 --> 06:47.381
nothing near what
you would be seeing here
on a daily basis.

06:47.464 --> 06:50.047
-Oh, really?
-Most of the people who
come in here are gonna be,

06:50.130 --> 06:51.547
you know, just disgusting
human beings.

06:51.631 --> 06:53.673
-How do you mean?
-Vile. Vulgar.

06:53.756 --> 06:55.047
The dregs of society.

06:55.130 --> 06:57.214
-I think I'm up to the task.
-You do?

06:57.297 --> 06:58.631
-Yeah.
-You know what?

06:58.714 --> 07:00.214
-(slaps)
-You're hired.

07:00.297 --> 07:02.381
-Thanks so much, Larry.
I won't let you down.
-Okay.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.047
-I don't think you will.
-I'm sorry.
While I have you here,

07:05.130 --> 07:07.506
I couldn't help but notice you
scratching at that rash...

07:07.589 --> 07:09.381
-Oh, yeah.
-...on the side of your neck
during the interview.

07:09.464 --> 07:11.089
Have you had a chance
to have that looked at?

07:11.172 --> 07:12.172
You know, I haven't.

07:12.255 --> 07:13.422
Well, I mean,
just looking at it,

07:13.506 --> 07:14.756
I can tell you I'm
not very concerned.

07:14.839 --> 07:16.130
-Mm.
-And I really think
it's no more than

07:16.214 --> 07:18.047
just a moderate outbreak
of atopic dermatitis.

07:18.130 --> 07:19.756
So there's a number
of over-the-counter

07:19.839 --> 07:21.381
topical ointments
you could use,

07:21.464 --> 07:23.506
steroidal creams, cortisone,
I could recommend.

07:23.589 --> 07:25.756
-Mm-hmm.
-Something like that should
clear up in a few days' time.

07:25.839 --> 07:29.089
Okay, well, you know what?
That was very impressive.

07:29.172 --> 07:30.589
-Oh, sure. Thanks.
-With all due respect,

07:30.673 --> 07:32.297
I think I'll go see your dad.

07:32.381 --> 07:35.381
-Thank you.
-Okay. Can I ask, uh, why?

07:35.464 --> 07:38.255
Yeah. 'Cause he's a doctor.

07:38.339 --> 07:41.464
-Great to meet ya.
-Thanks again, Larry.
I appreciate it.

07:41.547 --> 07:43.047
-Okay. You're welcome.
-I won't let you down.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.964
-I don't think you will.
-Have a good day.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.798
All right. You, too.

07:46.881 --> 07:48.589
-That's a good fuckin' kid,
right there.
-He's gonna work out.

07:48.673 --> 07:50.047
-Leon: Yeah.
-Yeah. Oh!

07:50.130 --> 07:52.798
-Oh, fuck.
-Man, I got snagged again
on this thing.

07:52.881 --> 07:54.839
-I know.
-All this shit. All this
is snagging hazards.

07:54.923 --> 07:56.673
-These. These.
All that shit.
-Yep. Absolutely.

07:56.756 --> 07:58.631
Walking with
a hot coffee and shit,
shit grab your pants.

07:58.714 --> 07:59.881
The shit pour on
your fuckin' chest.

07:59.964 --> 08:01.589
-We gotta get some new handles.
-Yeah.

08:01.673 --> 08:03.005
-Man: Hey.
-Fuckin' snagging hazard.

08:03.089 --> 08:04.381
Um...

08:04.881 --> 08:08.422
I'm Harold. The,
the bathroom attendant
from the other day.

08:09.297 --> 08:12.422
I got fired for leaving my post.

08:12.506 --> 08:14.381
-Oh, my God. Really?
-Yeah.

08:14.464 --> 08:16.005
-He fired you?
-Yes.

08:16.089 --> 08:18.214
-What an asshole.
-So whatever you can do

08:18.297 --> 08:20.089
to get my job back,
I would appreciate it.

08:20.172 --> 08:22.381
-Leon: Mm.
-'Cause you were the one that,
you know,

08:22.464 --> 08:23.964
invited me to leave the room.

08:24.047 --> 08:26.089
But you know what,
if I may say?

08:26.172 --> 08:28.089
Maybe a blessing in disguise.

08:28.172 --> 08:29.964
The bathroom
is a palace of shame.

08:30.047 --> 08:32.255
And having someone
watch you in there, it just,

08:32.339 --> 08:33.839
it doubles down on the shame.

08:33.923 --> 08:36.172
Just talk to the restaurant
manager, please. Okay?

08:36.255 --> 08:37.589
Okay, I'll talk to him.

08:37.673 --> 08:39.130
Leon:
Hey. My man.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.339
You got those
little mints and shit

08:40.422 --> 08:41.798
you guys have
on the fuckin' counter?

08:41.881 --> 08:43.381
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

08:43.464 --> 08:44.756
Leon:
Yeah.

08:44.839 --> 08:46.673
Still fuckin' working.
Look at you.

08:46.756 --> 08:48.422
-Huh.
-For me?

08:49.756 --> 08:51.673
-Thanks.
-My man.

08:51.756 --> 08:54.047
-That's for you. My man.
-Thank you, brother.

08:54.130 --> 08:56.422
That's from both of us.

08:56.506 --> 08:59.255
Leon:
I can't stop thinking about
that magical vagina.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.923
When you use
the word "magical,"

09:01.005 --> 09:02.547
that's takin' that shit
to another level.

09:02.631 --> 09:03.839
I wanna see
what the fuck that is.

09:03.923 --> 09:05.798
-Yeah, me, too.
-That fuckin' vagina

09:05.881 --> 09:07.297
could pull a rabbit
out of that motherfucker.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.881
-Yeah.
-Or, like, put this
fuckin' Pop-Tart

09:09.964 --> 09:11.964
in that fuckin' vagina
and toast that shit.

09:12.047 --> 09:13.673
-Aah.
-There you go.

09:13.756 --> 09:16.297
-Now that is fuckin'
useful, magical...
-That's, that's magical vagina.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.464
-That's fuckin' magical. Huh?
-That's exactly right.

09:18.547 --> 09:20.881
(ring tone playing)

09:20.964 --> 09:22.339
Hello?

09:22.422 --> 09:24.547
Hey.
Did you hear about Carl?

09:24.631 --> 09:26.547
Carl? What?

09:26.631 --> 09:29.506
He, uh, he killed himself.

09:32.255 --> 09:34.339
Oh, my God.

09:35.798 --> 09:37.673
Oh, my God.

09:37.756 --> 09:39.381
What?

09:39.464 --> 09:41.547
Yeah. Yeah.

09:41.631 --> 09:44.547
-What the fuck?
-Jeff (over phone):
I know. It's unbelievable.

09:44.631 --> 09:47.047
I mean, he was,
he was playing great.

09:47.130 --> 09:49.506
What did he shoot?
He shot, like,
82 or something.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.339
-How do you kill yourself
when you're playing so well?
-I know.

09:52.422 --> 09:54.214
-Did he leave a note?
-Jeff: Yeah.

09:54.297 --> 09:57.255
He said, "I can't take
any more disappointment."

09:57.339 --> 09:59.130
Holy shit.

09:59.214 --> 10:02.089
-Jeff: What the hell's
he talking about?
-Holy shit.

10:02.172 --> 10:04.089
"I can't take any more
disappointment."

10:04.172 --> 10:07.422
That's what he used to say
when we would watch
the Jet games together.

10:07.506 --> 10:09.798
"I can't take any more
disappointment."

10:09.881 --> 10:11.255
That's an exact quote.

10:11.339 --> 10:14.089
-Really?
-Jeff, I've seen that guy sob

10:14.172 --> 10:16.714
after losses.
During games,
I've seen him sob.

10:16.798 --> 10:18.214
Who knew he was so tortured?

10:18.297 --> 10:19.506
And they just kept losing,

10:19.589 --> 10:21.589
and it kept eating at him,
and eating at him.

10:21.673 --> 10:25.089
And he just...
he couldn't take any more
disappointment.

10:25.172 --> 10:26.589
Oh, my God.

10:26.673 --> 10:28.964
The Jets killed Carl.

10:29.047 --> 10:31.130
-And a little bit of the Knicks.
-Jeff: That's nuts.

10:31.214 --> 10:34.923
-The Jets killed him.
-I want to send Veronica
a condolence text.

10:35.005 --> 10:38.255
-G-- You have her number?
-Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
text her one, too.

10:38.339 --> 10:39.881
Okay.

10:40.923 --> 10:41.964
(hangs up phone)

10:42.047 --> 10:43.756
Fuck happened?

10:43.839 --> 10:47.214
Carl. The guy whose wife
has the magical vagina.

10:47.297 --> 10:49.631
He killed himself.
'Cause of the fucking Jets.

10:49.714 --> 10:51.923
-Hmm.
-Larry: I gotta write a...

10:52.005 --> 10:53.964
condolence text
to the widow.

10:54.047 --> 10:56.673
-Oh, man.
-Larry: "Dear Veronica,

10:57.214 --> 10:59.589
"Just heard about Carl.

11:01.005 --> 11:02.839
So sorry."

11:05.464 --> 11:07.047
(Leon sighs)

11:07.130 --> 11:08.756
Larry: What else?
I need something else.

11:08.839 --> 11:10.631
"Try and make the, uh,

11:10.714 --> 11:12.339
-the best of it."
-Ooh.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.172
I don't know.
I can't come up with
a third line.

11:14.255 --> 11:16.047
Maybe you can write,
"I wish...

11:16.130 --> 11:18.172
your magical vagina
could have saved him."

11:18.255 --> 11:19.923
-Yeah. Somethin' like that.
-Somethin' like that.

11:20.005 --> 11:22.756
-"Would love to get a glimpse
of that magical vagina."
-Mm.

11:22.839 --> 11:25.464
"Is it possible
I can test drive
that motherfucker?"

11:25.547 --> 11:27.381
-"We have many questions."
-Leon: Many questions.

11:27.464 --> 11:30.172
"My friend and I have
many questions about
your magical vagina."

11:30.255 --> 11:33.339
-Yes.
-"One day, perhaps you'll
get around to answering them.

11:33.422 --> 11:35.339
-When it's appropriate."
-I fuckin' love that.

11:35.422 --> 11:38.589
-(pats) Great.
-Leon: It's to the point.
And it's short.

11:39.923 --> 11:42.089
-Larry. Good to see you.
-Oh. Hey, Doc.

11:42.172 --> 11:43.381
You hear about Carl?

11:43.464 --> 11:45.089
Yeah. Terrible.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.255
Why would somebody
do something like that?

11:47.631 --> 11:48.798
Well...

11:49.631 --> 11:51.047
It was the Jets.

11:51.130 --> 11:52.172
My God.

11:52.255 --> 11:54.005
He just couldn't take it.

11:54.089 --> 11:55.673
It ate him up inside.

11:55.756 --> 11:56.839
-What a catastrophe.
-I know.

11:56.923 --> 11:58.381
Last year started
with such promise,

11:58.464 --> 12:00.714
then Darnold gets mono--
season's over by game three.

12:00.798 --> 12:02.756
I'm talking about
his widow, Veronica.
His family.

12:02.839 --> 12:04.339
That's the catastrophe.

12:04.422 --> 12:05.381
Oh, of course, yeah.

12:05.464 --> 12:07.089
You've still got
a rash there, Larry.

12:07.172 --> 12:08.756
-Yeah.
-You know,
I'm a little offended.

12:08.839 --> 12:10.255
My son gave you a free consult,

12:10.339 --> 12:11.339
and he told you what was wrong.

12:11.422 --> 12:12.506
And you kind of poo-pooed it?

12:12.589 --> 12:14.381
Yeah.
Of course I poo-pooed it.

12:14.464 --> 12:15.798
What, he's not a doctor.

12:15.881 --> 12:17.881
He's the son of a doctor.
That should be good enough.

12:17.964 --> 12:19.881
Ah, not really. I mean,
I don't want to listen to

12:19.964 --> 12:21.714
Louis Armstrong's son
play the trumpet.

12:21.798 --> 12:23.673
-Want me to check out your rash?
-Would you?

12:23.756 --> 12:25.673
-Absolutely.
-Thank you.

12:26.631 --> 12:29.506
That's atopic dermatitis.
Otherwise known as eczema.

12:29.589 --> 12:31.005
Over the counter,
you can get some cortisone.

12:31.089 --> 12:32.714
It should go away.
What did my son say?

12:32.798 --> 12:34.881
-He said exactly
the same thing as you.
-The same thing. You see?

12:34.964 --> 12:37.839
-He knows what he's doing.
He's got-- It's in the blood.
-Yeah.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.673
-Hope you get better.
Cortisone.
-Yeah.

12:39.756 --> 12:40.923
Dave:
Jimmy, what's the rule on this?

12:41.005 --> 12:42.547
He swung,
the club head fell off.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.506
But he followed through.
That's a stroke, right?

12:44.589 --> 12:46.047
Decision 14-2.

12:46.130 --> 12:47.964
A stroke is defined by
forward movement

12:48.047 --> 12:49.172
of the club to the ball.

12:49.255 --> 12:51.798
A shaft in itself
is not a club.

12:51.881 --> 12:53.172
-No penalty.
-Golf player: Ah, yes!

12:53.255 --> 12:56.005
-Aw, fuck you, Jimmy.
-Read the rule book.

12:56.673 --> 12:58.756
Wow. Jimmy.

12:58.839 --> 13:01.464
-You know your stuff.
Let me ask you something.
-You better believe it.

13:01.547 --> 13:04.339
Is there such a thing
as a putter being
too straight?

13:04.422 --> 13:06.839
Definitely.
Look at this putter, here.

13:06.923 --> 13:08.923
-Has a tilt, right?
-Larry: Yeah.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.339
Definitely not 90 degrees.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.422
-Has to have at least
10 degrees of tilt.
-Yeah.

13:12.506 --> 13:15.631
-So it can't have it more
than an 80-degree angle?
-Correct.

13:15.714 --> 13:17.631
Can't be like this.
Has to be like this.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.798
Has to be like this.
Tilt. Just like this.

13:19.881 --> 13:21.047
Well, what do you know?

13:21.130 --> 13:23.089
You know the penalty
for a non-conforming club?

13:23.172 --> 13:25.089
-No.
-Disqualification.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.547
-Disqualification.
-Disqualification.

13:29.381 --> 13:31.506
-Thanks, Jimmy.
-You're welcome.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.923
â™ª

13:43.798 --> 13:45.881
Excuse me. Can I help you?

13:45.964 --> 13:47.798
Oh. Looking for
Richard Lewis' bag.

13:47.881 --> 13:49.631
Oh. He never leaves
his bag here.

13:49.714 --> 13:51.923
-He always takes it home.
-Really?

13:52.923 --> 13:54.506
-Is that unusual?
-Very.

13:54.589 --> 13:56.589
He's probably the only one
in the club who does that.

13:57.130 --> 13:58.714
You don't say.

13:58.798 --> 14:00.339
Huh.

14:00.422 --> 14:01.714
Well.

14:02.881 --> 14:04.756
Isn't that interesting?

14:05.214 --> 14:07.130
Isn't that interesting?

14:08.839 --> 14:10.673
Marilyn,
if you could show them
to their table.

14:10.756 --> 14:14.214
-Marilyn: Right this way.
-Manager: Thank you so much.
Benvenuto a Tiato.

14:14.297 --> 14:15.839
-Hi.
-Hello.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.255
-Benvenuto a Tiato  .
-Oh, grazie.

14:18.339 --> 14:19.881
-I called earlier.
-Manager: Yes.

14:19.964 --> 14:21.881
I have a reservation.
Uh, Larry David.

14:21.964 --> 14:25.005
And I requested a table
by the window.

14:25.089 --> 14:27.130
â™ª

14:31.923 --> 14:34.673
I'm sorry,
but we cannot honor
that request.

14:35.673 --> 14:38.673
-And why is that, may I ask?
-Uh, because we're
all filled up over here.

14:38.756 --> 14:42.506
-I see tables.
-Yes, those are reserved
for a few people.

14:42.589 --> 14:44.089
But I do have
a lovely table for you.

14:44.172 --> 14:46.589
Let me take a guess.
Somewhere over there?

14:46.673 --> 14:48.756
-Uh, yes.
I have a wonderful table.
-Ah.

14:48.839 --> 14:50.964
-What a wild guess. Yeah.
-Yes.

14:51.047 --> 14:52.422
Great.

14:53.422 --> 14:54.798
Shall we?

15:00.381 --> 15:03.422
Mr. David. Please.
Your table here.

15:03.506 --> 15:05.130
Come along.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.964
Look at this one.

15:09.714 --> 15:11.923
What happened here?

15:13.130 --> 15:15.214
Oh. Will you look at this?

15:15.297 --> 15:16.798
Oh, my God.

15:17.631 --> 15:19.714
Mr. David. Here we are.

15:19.798 --> 15:22.881
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.464
-Okay.
-All right. Thanks.

15:24.547 --> 15:26.255
-I get it. I get it.
-Thank you. Thank you.

15:26.339 --> 15:27.589
Anything else I can
get for you?

15:27.673 --> 15:29.297
-Hey, let me ask you a question.
-Manager: Yeah.

15:30.214 --> 15:32.589
Why, why did you fire
that bathroom attendant?

15:32.673 --> 15:34.422
-Because he left his post.
-Okay, you know what?

15:34.506 --> 15:36.464
I asked him to leave.
I requested it.

15:36.547 --> 15:39.714
With all due respect,
Mr. David,
I can't fire you.

15:39.798 --> 15:42.422
But I can fire Harold
for not doing his job.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.255
Oh, yeah. Bravo.
Good going.

15:44.339 --> 15:46.089
Well, benvenuto a Tiato.

15:46.172 --> 15:47.089
Benvenuto.

15:47.172 --> 15:48.839
-Susie: Thank you.
-Thank you.

15:53.089 --> 15:55.506
(sighs)
Look at this.

15:55.589 --> 15:57.381
Look at this.

15:57.464 --> 16:00.005
Look where I wound up
in my life.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.255
In the ugly section.

16:02.339 --> 16:04.339
I'm in the ugly section.

16:04.422 --> 16:07.005
You know, my whole life
I suspected I was ugly.

16:07.714 --> 16:10.547
But I never really knew.
I never had proof.

16:10.631 --> 16:13.005
And now I have proof.
I have proof.

16:13.089 --> 16:15.339
This is it.
This is the proof.

16:15.422 --> 16:17.047
What are you talking about?

16:17.714 --> 16:20.130
How did I wind up here?

16:20.214 --> 16:22.923
How did I wind up here!

16:23.547 --> 16:25.381
Oh, my God!

16:27.673 --> 16:30.005
How come you don't leave
your clubs in the bag room?

16:30.089 --> 16:32.130
-My, my clubs?
-Yeah.

16:32.214 --> 16:34.047
-I take 'em home.
-Why?

16:34.130 --> 16:36.547
-Because things have been
stolen from the, the, the--
-Stolen?

16:36.631 --> 16:38.547
Wh-wh-what's stolen?
That's crazy.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.255
-Have you ever heard of
one thing being stolen--
-Yeah, I had a--

16:41.339 --> 16:44.130
-Never. It's a private club.
-Let me ask you something.

16:44.214 --> 16:46.464
Is your putter
to specifications?

16:46.547 --> 16:48.005
Are you out of your mind?

16:48.089 --> 16:49.506
I'm asking a question.

16:49.589 --> 16:51.214
-That's the reason why.
-You know, you know,

16:51.297 --> 16:52.798
it can't be over 80 degrees.
You know that.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.464
-I don't know--
-The angle can't be
over 80 degrees.

16:54.547 --> 16:55.798
Look, you're a golf nut.

16:55.881 --> 16:57.923
I've just been playing
on a roll lately, and I--

16:58.005 --> 17:00.839
A roll? I paid you $500.
Let's be clear about that.

17:00.923 --> 17:03.714
-Look, I don't want anyone
to steal my lucky clubs.
-Let's be clear.

17:03.798 --> 17:06.089
-So I take it home.
-Well, then let us measure it.

17:06.172 --> 17:07.631
You're not measuring my putter.

17:07.714 --> 17:09.714
You're just,
you're just a b--
A sore loser.

17:09.798 --> 17:11.339
Both of you. Sore losers.

17:11.422 --> 17:12.589
What?

17:14.047 --> 17:16.089
-Larry: There she is.
-Richard: Poor woman.

17:16.172 --> 17:17.631
Larry:
You know, with, uh,

17:17.714 --> 17:19.923
Carl's passing, the...

17:20.673 --> 17:23.756
magical vagina is,
is now available.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.964
Jeff:
Normal vagina,
I'd wait a year.

17:26.047 --> 17:27.506
But magical vagina,
six months.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.631
I think the dead husband
would, would approve

17:29.714 --> 17:32.005
-any of us because he,
he liked us.
-Without a doubt.

17:32.089 --> 17:35.005
Larry: We were friends.
You gotta be pretty curious,
though, don't you.

17:35.089 --> 17:37.506
All right,
I'm slightly curious.

17:37.589 --> 17:39.047
My interest is piqued.

17:39.130 --> 17:41.547
-Maybe I'll go pay my respects.
-What are you, nuts?

17:41.631 --> 17:43.214
-Jeff: Oh, come on.
You can't do that.
-Richard: Now?

17:43.297 --> 17:45.047
-Larry: What are you
talking about?
-Where are you going?

17:45.130 --> 17:47.130
Not, not, not--
I said six months
to a year.

17:47.214 --> 17:49.214
-What the hell is he--
-Richard: Is he crazy?

17:49.297 --> 17:51.130
-Look at him. Oh, my God.
-Hi.

17:51.214 --> 17:52.798
-Hi, Larry.
-Hi.

17:52.881 --> 17:55.464
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Of course. Of course.
I'm so sorry.

17:55.547 --> 17:58.214
-Carl would be so happy
to see so many of his friends.
-Yeah.

17:58.297 --> 18:01.172
-Especially his
golf friends here.
-Yeah. Yeah.

18:02.464 --> 18:04.673
I'm so thrown by this.

18:04.756 --> 18:06.756
I really am. I just...

18:07.339 --> 18:09.381
You were all playing
golf together, right?

18:09.464 --> 18:12.464
-Yeah.
-Did he seem different
to you, or... ?

18:12.547 --> 18:14.005
Yeah.

18:14.089 --> 18:16.631
-Was he agitated
about anything?
-Yeah, he was...

18:16.714 --> 18:19.172
very upset about the Jets.

18:20.297 --> 18:23.089
-The fucking Jets.
-Yeah. I know.

18:23.172 --> 18:26.089
-He loved them so much,
and all they did was disappoint.
-Yes, I know. I know.

18:26.172 --> 18:29.547
We all do. We all do,
and that's, that's
what happens, but...

18:29.631 --> 18:32.422
to take it to this level,
I mean, it's just...

18:32.506 --> 18:34.631
The Jets ruined our marriage.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.047
I couldn't stand
to be around him.

18:36.130 --> 18:37.381
Everything was about the Jets.

18:37.464 --> 18:38.673
We had to paint
our room green.

18:38.756 --> 18:41.547
One night, he just woke up
and yelled, "Watson!"

18:41.631 --> 18:44.422
What is that?
Is that a Sherlock Holmes
reference or something?

18:44.506 --> 18:47.255
No, I think
that's a reference
to Deshaun Watson,

18:47.339 --> 18:49.506
who the Jets
passed on drafting

18:49.589 --> 18:50.923
in 2017.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.422
That's what I think that is.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.130
So Carl...

18:54.214 --> 18:55.964
is just another loss
on their record.

18:56.047 --> 18:59.464
-I don't think it's the first
person they've done that to.
-No.

18:59.547 --> 19:02.297
I really like the handles
on the coffin.

19:02.839 --> 19:04.631
Do you know where you
got those, by any chance?

19:04.714 --> 19:06.589
No, Larry, I don't know
where I got them.

19:06.673 --> 19:08.422
-They came with,
with the casket.
-Uh-huh.

19:08.506 --> 19:12.214
I'll tell you why I'm asking.
Because I'm opening up
a coffee place.

19:12.297 --> 19:14.130
-Oh, you are?
-Yeah. Latte Larry's.

19:14.214 --> 19:15.964
-What a cute name.
-Oh, well, you know.

19:16.047 --> 19:17.714
-Larry, that's cute.
-Yeah, I picked it out. Yeah.

19:17.798 --> 19:20.464
-But anyway, uh, you know,
for the cabinets...
-Mm.

19:20.547 --> 19:22.130
I've been looking for handles.

19:22.214 --> 19:23.506
Can't seem to find ones
that I like,

19:23.589 --> 19:25.297
but I really like those
on the coffin.

19:25.381 --> 19:28.005
Oh. Okay.

19:28.089 --> 19:30.464
So if you can somehow...

19:30.547 --> 19:33.589
call the person
who sold you the coffin,

19:33.673 --> 19:36.506
maybe get some,
uh, info on that,
that would be great.

19:36.589 --> 19:39.464
I mean, I don't know where
I could find the contact
for you, but...

19:39.547 --> 19:42.756
-Well, if, uh...
-Let me bury my husband first,
and then I'll...

19:42.839 --> 19:45.964
-find out the contact info.
-No, of course. You bury,
you mourn, and,

19:46.047 --> 19:48.839
and then, uh, uh,
then you ask.

19:48.923 --> 19:50.172
Okay.

19:50.255 --> 19:52.339
-Okay.
-It is now time to recite...

19:52.422 --> 19:54.339
Um, I'm gonna take
a quick pic,
if that's okay.

19:54.422 --> 19:57.047
-No, Larry. Larry,
I'll text it to you, okay?
-Siri: (beeps) In my room.

19:57.130 --> 19:59.005
-It seems like I cut you off.
-(camera shutter clicks)

19:59.089 --> 20:01.130
-Siri: ...in my room.
-Your Siri is on.

20:01.214 --> 20:03.923
-Siri: Anyone...
-(Rabbi continues indistinctly)

20:04.756 --> 20:07.297
-Larry: Hey. Hey, guess what?
-Jeff: What?

20:07.381 --> 20:09.339
I think I detected

20:09.422 --> 20:11.464
a flicker of interest

20:11.547 --> 20:13.839
-from the widow.
-No, you didn't.

20:13.923 --> 20:16.047
-I think I did.
I'm not, you know--
-Jeff: That wasn't even a...

20:16.130 --> 20:17.714
-You're crazy.
-You're dreaming.

20:17.798 --> 20:19.923
There were signs that
I picked up on.

20:20.005 --> 20:23.005
She touched my arm,
she was very affectionate.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.381
-She was laughing.
-Yeah, it was the time
of her life.

20:25.464 --> 20:27.214
-(phone beeps)
-That's what
you're describing.

20:27.297 --> 20:28.381
Oh, my God.

20:28.464 --> 20:29.923
-Jeff: What?
-What happened?

20:30.005 --> 20:31.255
Oh, my God.

20:31.339 --> 20:32.506
-Text.
-Get out. No.

20:32.589 --> 20:33.673
I got a text!

20:33.756 --> 20:35.089
-Jeff: From the widow?
-Larry: Yeah.

20:35.172 --> 20:36.881
-You're a liar.
-"Thanks so much for coming

20:36.964 --> 20:38.047
"and for the kind words.

20:38.130 --> 20:40.798
Can't wait to check out
your coffee shop."

20:40.881 --> 20:43.214
-You know, I think
she's just being nice.
-Yeah. Me, too.

20:43.297 --> 20:45.464
-I gotta text her back.
-No, no, no, no, no.

20:45.547 --> 20:47.673
You'll text her back
in at least a week.

20:47.756 --> 20:49.464
-...have coffee...
-Jeff: Are you fucking
kidding me?

20:49.547 --> 20:51.589
-(Larry's phone bloops)
-You sent it? What'd you say?

20:51.673 --> 20:53.881
"If you need to talk,
I'd be happy to get together
for coffee,

20:53.964 --> 20:56.297
-or any meal
of your choosing."
-Jeff: Oh!

20:56.381 --> 20:57.964
Now you're
asking her on a date!

20:58.047 --> 21:00.589
-No, but lunch.
She could mean lunch...
-Oh, that is disgust--

21:00.673 --> 21:03.756
You upped it from coffee
to a date.

21:03.839 --> 21:05.464
-(phone bloops)
-(clicks tongue)

21:05.547 --> 21:07.881
-Richard: What?
-What?

21:07.964 --> 21:09.506
"It's a date."

21:13.005 --> 21:16.047
-Ah. Benvenuto a Tiato.
-Hello.

21:16.130 --> 21:19.172
We have a beautiful
table for you
right by the window.

21:19.547 --> 21:21.589
Right, uh-- Mr. David,
how are you?

21:21.673 --> 21:23.589
-Larry: I'm, I'm swell.
-Wonderful.

21:23.673 --> 21:25.964
Yeah. So, uh,
you were about to say?

21:26.047 --> 21:28.422
We have a beautiful
table for you,

21:28.506 --> 21:29.881
uh, right back there.

21:29.964 --> 21:31.714
-You were about
to seat her over there.
-Uh, yes.

21:31.798 --> 21:34.130
-But that's a table for one.
-Table for one?

21:34.214 --> 21:36.422
I, I don't get that.
What's the difference
between a table for one,

21:36.506 --> 21:38.130
and a table for two?

21:38.214 --> 21:39.631
One person.

21:39.714 --> 21:41.631
-That's so interesting. Yeah.
-Manager: It is.

21:41.714 --> 21:43.464
All right, so I think I get
the way it works here.

21:43.547 --> 21:45.297
-If it's fifty-fifty...
-Manager: Uh-huh.

21:45.381 --> 21:47.381
One good-looking
and one ugly,

21:47.464 --> 21:49.589
both go to the ugly.
Is that how it works?

21:49.673 --> 21:51.881
'Cause in baseball,
a tie goes to the runner.

21:51.964 --> 21:53.339
Here, a tie goes to the ugly.

21:53.422 --> 21:55.756
Mr. David, I really
do not see a difference

21:55.839 --> 21:57.714
between the good-looking...

21:57.798 --> 22:00.297
-and the ugly.
-Are you saying to me that

22:00.381 --> 22:02.923
you're gonna put
this beautiful woman

22:03.005 --> 22:05.839
into that section?
Is that what you're
going to do?

22:05.923 --> 22:07.964
She doesn't belong there.
Yeah, sure,

22:08.047 --> 22:09.964
put me there.
I get it, okay. But...

22:10.047 --> 22:12.047
-Come on.
-Larry, a table
anywhere is fine.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.464
No. No, it's not fine.
It's not fine.

22:14.547 --> 22:16.714
Look what's going on
over there. Take a look.

22:16.923 --> 22:19.255
The table over here
is really lovely.

22:19.339 --> 22:22.255
I think you'll enjoy it.
Please. Follow me.

22:22.714 --> 22:24.422
Oh, my God.

22:24.839 --> 22:26.214
If you ever do come back,

22:26.297 --> 22:28.464
we have some beautiful tables
over there.

22:30.756 --> 22:32.506
Oh, my God.

22:32.589 --> 22:34.589
What a horror show.

22:35.756 --> 22:38.756
This is a fucking horror show.

22:38.839 --> 22:42.130
How the fuck can you do this?
It's not fair.

22:43.089 --> 22:44.506
This is not fair.

22:45.089 --> 22:47.214
There's just so much
expectation out in the world

22:47.297 --> 22:48.881
-of how I'm supposed to grieve.
-Yeah. Right.

22:48.964 --> 22:50.631
-Of course. Yeah.
-The mourning process.

22:50.714 --> 22:52.130
-Right. I get it.
-The way people look at me.

22:52.214 --> 22:53.464
How long is she gonna
be grieving for?

22:53.547 --> 22:55.005
It's none of their business.

22:55.089 --> 22:56.881
What people didn't know
is that our relationship

22:56.964 --> 22:58.381
was pretty frayed
by that point.

22:58.464 --> 23:01.005
-Mm. Really?
-Yeah, we were living
separate lives.

23:01.089 --> 23:04.172
-Ami-amicable.
But separate lives.
-Mm-hmm.

23:04.255 --> 23:05.964
But I know what you
mean about, you know.

23:06.047 --> 23:08.798
-There's unwritten rules about
how a widow's supposed to act.
-Right.

23:08.881 --> 23:12.214
You know, when I was a kid,
I remember my turtle died.

23:12.297 --> 23:13.589
And I remember,
"Oh, hey.

23:13.673 --> 23:15.673
"That's too bad that,
you know, the turtle,

23:15.756 --> 23:17.047
turtle died." And...

23:17.130 --> 23:18.881
A little turtle.
And my friends called me up
and said,

23:18.964 --> 23:20.631
"Hey, we're going out.
We're gonna play punch ball."

23:20.714 --> 23:23.214
I said, "Eh, you know what?
I probably shouldn't.
My turtle died."

23:23.297 --> 23:24.714
And then I'm sitting there
thinking, geez,

23:24.798 --> 23:26.673
my friends are out there
playing punch ball.

23:26.756 --> 23:28.381
What, you know,
what am I doing?

23:28.464 --> 23:31.005
So, after half an hour,
I just flushed it
down the toilet,

23:31.089 --> 23:33.506
and went out and
played punch ball.

23:34.464 --> 23:36.547
So I know, I know how you feel.

23:37.255 --> 23:39.964
Yeah. Well, my condolences
to your turtle.

23:40.047 --> 23:41.255
Yeah.

23:42.172 --> 23:43.839
So what's the matter
with your neck?

23:43.964 --> 23:45.130
What do you keep
scratching over there?

23:45.214 --> 23:47.130
I've got some kind of rash.

23:47.214 --> 23:48.798
-Have you seen a doctor?
-I wanted to,

23:48.881 --> 23:50.589
but Joshua Winokur
is my dermatologist,

23:50.673 --> 23:51.964
and he's not here right now.

23:52.047 --> 23:53.089
You should go see his son.

23:53.172 --> 23:54.464
Is his son a doctor?
I never knew that.

23:54.547 --> 23:56.422
-No.
-Isn't his son
in high school?

23:56.506 --> 23:57.673
Yeah, but he's a senior.

23:57.756 --> 23:59.422
-I mean, if you go,
then I'll go.
-Yeah.

23:59.506 --> 24:02.005
-I'll have him check it out.
-I'll set it up for you.

24:05.005 --> 24:06.547
What the fuck?

24:07.297 --> 24:08.673
Oh, my God.

24:08.756 --> 24:11.339
Seating Susie over there?

24:12.422 --> 24:14.464
-Really?
-No, she's not. She's not
seeing anybody right now.

24:14.547 --> 24:16.255
-Do you think she'd be open?
-Yeah. I think she--

24:16.339 --> 24:17.589
Susie and Ted:
Oh.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.547
-What are you doing here?
-As a matter of fact,

24:19.631 --> 24:21.381
-we happen to be
talking about Cheryl...
-Susie: Yeah.

24:21.464 --> 24:23.839
and the possibility
of the two of us
getting back together.

24:23.923 --> 24:26.005
No, I meant,
what are you doing
in this section?

24:26.089 --> 24:29.089
-Why are you in this, you don't
belong in this section.
-Oh, don't. Don't even...

24:29.172 --> 24:31.381
-start with that shit.
-You should be over there.
Are you kidding?

24:31.464 --> 24:32.964
The only reason
I was over there
the other day

24:33.047 --> 24:34.631
was 'cause I was
with you and fat boy.

24:34.714 --> 24:36.714
-Oh, you think you got
seated here on your own?
-Yes.

24:36.798 --> 24:38.756
-Huh? It had nothing
to do with him, huh?
-Hey, hey.

24:38.839 --> 24:40.214
-Well, he's a handsome
man, Larry.
-Larry: Yeah.

24:40.297 --> 24:42.464
You're on his coattails.
That's why you're here.

24:42.547 --> 24:46.214
-What are you doing here?
-I'm having lunch with,
with, with Veronica Sacks.

24:46.297 --> 24:48.589
Susie:
Oh, my God, Larry!

24:48.673 --> 24:51.464
-Is that...
Carl, who just died?
-Susie: Yes.

24:51.547 --> 24:53.214
The one who just died,
who killed himself

24:53.297 --> 24:54.673
-over the fucking Jets.
-Oh, Larry.

24:54.756 --> 24:56.881
-It's just a lunch. Come on.
-Susie: He died, what?

24:56.964 --> 24:58.547
-Like, less than a week ago.
-Less than a week ago.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.464
First of all, she
shouldn't even be
out of the fucking house.

25:00.547 --> 25:02.631
-Oh, get out of here.
-She should be home,
in black,

25:02.714 --> 25:04.839
mourning and grieving.
And you!

25:04.923 --> 25:06.464
That you would go after...

25:06.547 --> 25:09.714
-I'm not going after.
-...the weak and
the, the vulnerable.

25:09.798 --> 25:11.506
What makes you think
she's not going after?

25:11.589 --> 25:13.172
-She's not going after you.
-Larry: I'm not going after.

25:13.255 --> 25:15.255
I bet you she is
because you've got
a lot of money, man.

25:15.339 --> 25:16.964
That's all she's doing it for.

25:17.047 --> 25:18.714
Good. Who cares?
What do I care?

25:18.798 --> 25:21.339
I can't even fathom
what depths of depravity

25:21.422 --> 25:23.005
would lead you
to go after a recent,

25:23.089 --> 25:24.964
very recent, widow.

25:25.047 --> 25:27.005
I have been
given to understand

25:27.089 --> 25:29.714
that she has
a magical vagina.

25:29.798 --> 25:32.756
-A what?
-Larry: A magical vagina.

25:32.839 --> 25:35.839
That is the most
inappropriate thing
I have ever heard.

25:35.923 --> 25:37.923
-H-h-hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Whoa, whoa.
-I'm just, I'm just saying.

25:38.005 --> 25:39.172
When you say magical...

25:39.255 --> 25:40.547
-Yeah.
-What, what do you mean?

25:40.631 --> 25:42.339
See, that's a very...

25:42.422 --> 25:44.172
Can you just
give us a second?

25:44.255 --> 25:46.589
I really wish I could,
but, Mr. David,

25:46.673 --> 25:49.255
I believe your
table is waiting.

25:49.339 --> 25:50.756
But she gets to stay here.

25:50.839 --> 25:52.798
You're letting her stay here?
This meeskite?

25:52.881 --> 25:55.047
Look at that face!
Are you serious?

25:55.130 --> 25:56.130
I don't get
what's going on here.

25:56.214 --> 25:57.214
I come in with
a beautiful woman,

25:57.297 --> 25:58.297
I'm sitting over there.

25:58.381 --> 25:59.297
He comes in with her,

25:59.381 --> 26:00.506
and they sit here.

26:00.589 --> 26:01.881
This policy makes no sense.

26:01.964 --> 26:03.214
There is no policy,
Mr. David.

26:03.297 --> 26:05.255
Oh, yeah. Right.

26:06.047 --> 26:08.547
And I'm not a meeskite,
you bald fuck!

26:08.631 --> 26:10.756
â™ª

26:19.255 --> 26:20.923
-Hi.
-Hello.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.172
I... huh.

26:25.464 --> 26:27.089
Is there a problem?

26:27.172 --> 26:29.297
I just have to use
the bathroom. Uh...

26:29.381 --> 26:32.005
I think I had a bad
ball of burrata.

26:32.089 --> 26:33.714
I could just use
a little privacy.

26:33.798 --> 26:36.881
-Oh, you could use
a little privacy.
-Yeah.

26:36.964 --> 26:38.756
Yeah, privacy.
It's a funny thing.

26:38.839 --> 26:41.089
-We all could use
a little privacy, right?
-Ooh.

26:41.172 --> 26:44.422
I know. Unfortunately,
I've got a couple of things
I need to do.

26:44.506 --> 26:48.172
-You know, freshen up
and all that.
-(groans)

26:48.506 --> 26:50.589
(gargling)

26:50.673 --> 26:52.756
-Mr. David, please.
-(spits)

26:52.839 --> 26:55.172
I can't do my job
if you're in here.

26:55.839 --> 26:57.214
-Yeah.
-(groans)

26:57.297 --> 27:00.089
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we make
a little deal?

27:00.172 --> 27:02.089
-Okay.
-I get the good-looking
section.

27:02.172 --> 27:03.339
There is no
good-looking section.

27:03.422 --> 27:05.631
-I get the good-looking
section.
-(grunts)

27:05.714 --> 27:07.422
-That's a yes? Okay.
-(grunts)

27:07.506 --> 27:09.547
Okay. And Harold
gets his job back.
But not this job.

27:09.631 --> 27:11.089
-Somewhere in the restaurant.
-Deal.

27:11.172 --> 27:11.964
-Deal.
-Deal.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.547
-Okay. Okay.
-Goodbye.

27:13.631 --> 27:15.547
(groaning)

27:15.631 --> 27:17.255
You made a really stupid deal,

27:17.339 --> 27:19.422
because as soon
as you got in the stall,
I would have left.

27:19.506 --> 27:21.089
You think I wanna
hang around here?

27:22.422 --> 27:23.964
These handles are great.

27:24.047 --> 27:25.005
-Right?
-Yeah.

27:25.089 --> 27:26.631
Yeah, they're from a coffin.

27:26.714 --> 27:28.089
-What? No.
-Yeah.

27:28.172 --> 27:30.631
-(honking)
-Larry: Oh. Okay.
Gotta go.

27:30.714 --> 27:31.756
-Okay.
-Keep working.

27:31.839 --> 27:32.631
Sure.

27:32.714 --> 27:34.297
Be careful.

27:34.381 --> 27:36.297
-What's wrong?
-Open the door.

27:36.381 --> 27:38.297
-I don't know how
to open the door.
-Oh, Jesus Christ.

27:38.381 --> 27:40.506
-It's a button over there.
-There's a million
fuckin' buttons.

27:40.589 --> 27:42.756
Right on your left there.
Press that button.

27:43.964 --> 27:45.506
-Look at you.
-Huh?

27:45.589 --> 27:47.255
-Mr. automotive man.
-Look at that.

27:47.339 --> 27:49.005
L-let's get something to eat,
or something, you know?

27:49.089 --> 27:51.130
-Yeah, you got something
on your nose.
-(knocking)

27:51.214 --> 27:53.172
-Hey. What the fuck?
-Robber: Open the window.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.798
-Fuck me.
-Robber: Come on, Bentley.
Give me your money.

27:55.881 --> 27:57.839
-I told you not
to get this car.
-Oh, shut up.

27:57.923 --> 27:59.631
-Like a fucking idiot.
-Here. Take it. Have--

27:59.714 --> 28:01.464
-Robber: What else you got?
-"I got a Bentley.
I got a Bentley."

28:01.547 --> 28:03.589
-Robber: What else
you got in the trunk?
-I got nothin' in there.

28:03.673 --> 28:05.089
Some golf clubs, that's all.

28:05.172 --> 28:06.673
-You don't need that shit.
-Golf clubs. Perfect, pop it.

28:06.756 --> 28:08.297
-Golf clubs?
-Robber: That's perfect. Pop it.

28:08.381 --> 28:09.464
Yeah. What's the difference?

28:09.547 --> 28:11.214
Pop the trunk, old timer.
Let's go.

28:11.297 --> 28:13.547
-You don't know how to pop--
-It's right over there,
on, on that--

28:13.631 --> 28:16.005
Who are you
working with, here?

28:16.089 --> 28:19.464
-I'll be right back.
-Be right back? What are you,
a maverick?

28:21.839 --> 28:23.798
Whoa, whoa. What's this?
What's this? No.

28:23.881 --> 28:25.172
Is that a Jets mask?

28:25.255 --> 28:27.005
Yeah, it's a Jets--
I'm a Jets fan.

28:27.089 --> 28:28.506
-You're a Jets fan?
-Yeah. They're the worst.

28:28.589 --> 28:29.839
Unbelievable! Me, too!

28:29.923 --> 28:31.547
Every year they lose.
You think they're gonna make--

28:31.631 --> 28:33.839
-It's awful. My friend
killed himself.
-He's better off.

28:33.923 --> 28:36.381
They're responsible for murder.
They should put 'em
all in prison.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.047
Sam:
Uh, I think my boss
is being robbed.

28:38.130 --> 28:39.214
What is this, a putter?

28:39.297 --> 28:40.673
Let me just take a look
at this putter.

28:40.756 --> 28:42.255
-I'm gonna need that.
-No, it's an interesting--

28:42.339 --> 28:44.381
Listen, man.
I need the putter--

28:44.464 --> 28:45.881
(police siren blaring)

28:45.964 --> 28:47.923
Keep the putter,
you son of a--

28:48.005 --> 28:50.422
(footsteps running)

28:51.255 --> 28:54.005
(police siren continues)

28:56.964 --> 28:58.381
Oh, thank God.

28:58.464 --> 28:59.547
What happened?

28:59.631 --> 29:02.798
(police sirens approaching)

29:02.881 --> 29:04.756
We have to talk.

29:04.839 --> 29:06.798
Lewis.

29:07.381 --> 29:08.756
Lewis.

29:08.839 --> 29:10.756
(police sirens blaring)

29:13.005 --> 29:14.881
Did you notice
the tremendous tip I left?

29:14.964 --> 29:16.714
-Did I notice?
-I, I filled it out
right in front of you,

29:16.798 --> 29:18.464
-hoping you'd see it.
-(laughs)

29:18.547 --> 29:20.130
-Huh? You liked it, right?
-I liked it. Yeah.

29:20.214 --> 29:22.673
-Sometimes I like a man to
show off a little bit like that.
-Yeah.

29:22.756 --> 29:24.798
I didn't do it for the waiter.
I, I did it for you.

29:24.881 --> 29:26.756
Aw, thank you, Larry.

29:26.839 --> 29:30.130
So how's the whole
grieving thing going?
Are you...

29:30.214 --> 29:33.089
-Oh.
-Are you feeling... widowy?

29:33.172 --> 29:37.047
Well, I'm not feeling
particularly widowy tonight.

29:37.130 --> 29:38.589
-Oh, is that so?
-Hmm.

29:38.673 --> 29:40.964
-Interesting.
-(giggles softly)

29:41.047 --> 29:42.381
Mm.

29:42.464 --> 29:45.631
-Aah. I like to hear that.
That's very good.
-Mm.

29:45.714 --> 29:48.589
-Yeah.
-Oh. Oh, dear.

29:48.673 --> 29:50.673
-Oh. I'm sorry, Larry.
-Yeah.

29:50.756 --> 29:51.756
Yeah.

29:51.839 --> 29:53.422
-Mm.
-Mm.

29:53.506 --> 29:55.047
-May he rest in peace.
-Yes.

29:55.130 --> 29:57.798
Is there anything else
on your mind?

29:58.047 --> 29:59.506
Well...

30:00.547 --> 30:02.297
Now that your mention it,

30:02.381 --> 30:04.130
one small thing.

30:04.214 --> 30:08.047
-A few days before
Carl died...
-Mm-hmm.

30:08.130 --> 30:10.089
-We played golf.
And, uh...
-Yeah.

30:10.172 --> 30:12.255
It was me and Jeff
against Carl and Lewis.

30:12.339 --> 30:15.422
-And I have found out
subsequently...
-Mm.

30:15.506 --> 30:18.881
that Lewis was using
an illegal putter.

30:18.964 --> 30:20.422
So...

30:20.506 --> 30:24.130
you know, I feel like
that $500 that I gave Carl

30:24.214 --> 30:27.130
-was, was taken under
false pretenses.
-Yeah?

30:27.214 --> 30:29.923
Okay. Why are you
telling me this?

30:30.005 --> 30:31.673
I just feel
I'm owed that money.

30:31.756 --> 30:33.589
-The man is dead.
-Yeah.

30:33.673 --> 30:36.714
-He can't pay you back.
-Right. But...

30:37.214 --> 30:41.172
-Are you asking me
to pay you $500?
-No. No.

30:41.255 --> 30:42.673
No. The, the estate.

30:42.756 --> 30:45.506
-The estate is me, Larry.
-Ah.

30:45.589 --> 30:47.214
I don't know why
you're asking this now.

30:47.297 --> 30:49.881
You know, I just feel like
I was cheated out of a win.

30:49.964 --> 30:52.047
Like in 2017

30:52.130 --> 30:54.005
when, uh, Austin
Seferian-Jenkins

30:54.089 --> 30:55.881
caught that ball and then
they said it wasn't a catch.

30:55.964 --> 30:59.172
-So stupid.
Cost the Jets the win.
-(scoffs)

30:59.255 --> 31:01.464
-The Jets?
-Yeah, they, they couldn't
beat the Patriots.

31:01.547 --> 31:03.673
The fucking Jets, Larry?

31:04.214 --> 31:07.381
You come into this house,
and bring up the Jets?

31:07.464 --> 31:09.381
Do you know how much
disappointment

31:09.464 --> 31:11.047
I have had to live with
from the Jets?

31:11.130 --> 31:12.756
-You've lived with
disappointment?
-Yeah.

31:12.839 --> 31:14.089
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, Larry.

31:14.172 --> 31:15.673
Do you know what this team
has done to me?

31:15.756 --> 31:18.005
I haven't enjoyed
a football season

31:18.089 --> 31:19.506
since 1969.

31:19.589 --> 31:21.964
-Oh.
-Maybe '98 when Parcells
was the coach for a year.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.756
-Get out of here.
-That was good, too.
But that's it.

31:24.839 --> 31:27.506
No, please, Larry.
Get out of here.

31:27.589 --> 31:31.172
-Oh, literally?
-Get the fuck out, Larry.

31:31.631 --> 31:33.464
Literally.

31:33.547 --> 31:36.839
Mm. (smacks lips)
Okay.

31:36.923 --> 31:39.589
-(pats)
-(sighs)

31:41.297 --> 31:43.381

didn't survive
the recovery, Larry.

31:45.089 --> 31:46.923
-Oh. Oh, is that so?
-He didn't survive
the ground...

31:47.005 --> 31:48.631
-...on the recovery!
-Is that so?

31:48.714 --> 31:50.798
-Yeah.
-You don't know what
you're talking about.

31:50.881 --> 31:53.714
-Watch the playback, Larry.
-I've seen the playback
100 times.

31:53.798 --> 31:56.047
-I've seen it, too.
-That was a catch.

31:56.130 --> 31:58.673
-Oh, come on!
-That was a bullshit call.

32:00.130 --> 32:03.506
-Let me show you to your table.
-Please do.

32:05.339 --> 32:07.381
-Left turn.
-I know.

32:08.005 --> 32:10.422
-Well, hello, ladies.
-Hello.

32:10.506 --> 32:12.506
-Lovely dress.
-Why, thank you.

32:12.589 --> 32:14.839
Well, what
a fine-looking group.

32:14.923 --> 32:18.339
It is a great honor
to be sitting amongst you.

32:21.047 --> 32:23.214
You know, there are a ton
of different restaurants

32:23.297 --> 32:25.172
for you to patronize
here in L.A.

32:25.255 --> 32:28.339
Do me a favor.
Get lost.

32:28.422 --> 32:31.172
Very well.
Benvenuto a Tiato.

32:31.255 --> 32:34.673
Mille grazie. Mille grazie.

32:35.756 --> 32:36.923
Ah?

32:37.005 --> 32:40.089
(sighs) A man can relax.

32:40.172 --> 32:42.964
-And breathe some fresh air.
-And breathe this fresh air.

32:43.047 --> 32:45.089
Gentlemen,
great to see you.

32:45.172 --> 32:47.130
-Well, look who's here.
-(Harold laughs)

32:47.214 --> 32:49.214
This is Harold,
the bathroom attendant

32:49.297 --> 32:50.756
-I was telling you about.
-Jeff: Harold!

32:50.839 --> 32:52.964
-Larry: Yeah. Yeah.
-Well, let me say,
let's shake.

32:53.047 --> 32:55.381
-I can't thank you enough.
-Eh, my pleasure.

32:55.464 --> 32:58.089
-Seriously. The tips are great.
-Oh, I'm so happy for you.

32:58.172 --> 32:59.798
Not only that,
I'm not getting that look,
you know?

32:59.881 --> 33:01.381
-Oh, yeah.
-Like, oh, this guy
in the bathroom.

33:01.464 --> 33:03.255
Yeah. What, what are you
doing in here? Yeah.

33:04.130 --> 33:06.047
And these are for you.
For you.

33:06.130 --> 33:08.172
-Great. Thanks so much.
-A couple for later.

33:08.255 --> 33:09.923
-Actually, I know them.
-Larry: Hey, hey.

33:10.005 --> 33:11.297
-He's with me.
-Sam: Those are my
friends over there.

33:11.381 --> 33:13.047
-Larry: He, he belongs
over here.
-Hey.

33:13.130 --> 33:14.464
-How you guys doing?
-Hey, Sam.

33:14.547 --> 33:16.089
-Sam: What's going on?
-Jeff: Hey, Sam.

33:16.172 --> 33:18.339
Uh, Larry, I want to
thank you again
for the referral.

33:18.422 --> 33:19.881
I had the examination
with Mrs. Sacks.

33:19.964 --> 33:21.381
Oh, great, great.
How did it go?

33:21.464 --> 33:23.631
Yeah, she just had
a small rash on her neck.

33:23.714 --> 33:26.089
-Larry: Yeah.
-Probably the result of stress.
You know, she's mourning

33:26.172 --> 33:27.964
right now and that can
take a toll on the skin.

33:28.047 --> 33:29.547
-Yeah, terrible toll.
-Um, other than that,

33:29.631 --> 33:31.673
incredibly healthy skin.
Maybe the healthiest I've seen

33:31.756 --> 33:33.130
in all my years in the field.

33:33.214 --> 33:34.923
Uh, wonderful
fibroblastic health,

33:35.005 --> 33:36.589
flawless lymphatic system.

33:36.673 --> 33:39.756
Really everything
from epidermis to
subcutaneous layer just...

33:39.839 --> 33:41.130
-Larry: Ah.
-...the image of health.

33:41.214 --> 33:42.714
She did have a few questions

33:42.798 --> 33:44.547
regarding some really
minor irregularities,

33:44.631 --> 33:47.255
so I did go ahead and conduct
a, uh, full body exam.

33:47.756 --> 33:49.089
-Full body?
-Yeah.

33:49.172 --> 33:51.839
Well, standard checkup
is full body. Yeah.

33:51.923 --> 33:54.255
Did you examine...

33:55.547 --> 33:58.255
-...everything?
-Everything.

33:58.756 --> 33:59.881
And?

33:59.964 --> 34:02.714
The only word that
comes to mind is, uh...

34:03.631 --> 34:05.089
magical.

-Man 2: What happened?
-Woman: I don't know!

34:12.714 --> 34:15.881
Help! Uh, someone's
having a seizure
in the ugly section.

34:15.964 --> 34:17.589
Is anyone here a doctor?

34:17.673 --> 34:20.130
No. But my father is.

Jon's starring in a movie.
The character's based on me.

So he's kind of shadowing me.

-People who go to brunch.

Well, we're--
we're not at brunch.

I can't do it.
