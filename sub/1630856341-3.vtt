00:17.083 --> 00:19.958
[Berlin] And then, we shall be ready
to begin the wonderful second act

00:19.958 --> 00:22.208
of our spectacular magic show.

00:22.208 --> 00:25.958
How to open a vault
that has steel walls 25 centimeters deep.

00:25.958 --> 00:28.291
[Berlin] And more importantly,
how to do it unnoticed.

00:28.291 --> 00:29.875
So we can come and go as we please,

00:29.875 --> 00:32.541
as if it was
a revolving door of a luxury hotel.

00:32.541 --> 00:36.208
An act worthy
of David Copperfield. [laughs]

00:36.208 --> 00:38.625
Keila, what will happen
when you take control of the cameras?

00:38.625 --> 00:41.208
I'll record footage
of the empty vault and antechamber

00:41.208 --> 00:43.916
and play them back in a loop
whenever we need to.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.625
[dramatic music continues]

00:49.708 --> 00:52.166
Wow. Check this huge bottle of champagne.

00:52.166 --> 00:54.041
[uncomfortable silence falls]

00:55.250 --> 00:56.500
Sorry, excuse me.

00:58.125 --> 01:00.000
Do you like champagne, Bruce?

01:00.000 --> 01:03.375
[exhales] Yeah. I mean,
I don't drink it every day, but I like it.

01:03.375 --> 01:06.041
Then, please, take the bottle
and help yourself.

01:06.041 --> 01:07.791
No, I'm good. Another time.

01:07.791 --> 01:10.250
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:10.250 --> 01:14.208
We've just interrupted Keila,
so time to seize the opportunity.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.416
Please, let's not wait any longer.

01:16.416 --> 01:17.458
Open it.

01:40.625 --> 01:41.625
[Bruce exhales]

01:43.625 --> 01:45.250
[Berlin, softly] Hmm. No.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.166
No. You have to take your time.

01:47.166 --> 01:50.666
Now, can you feel those citrus pearls
exploding in your mouth?

01:50.666 --> 01:51.958
Yeah, yeah. I feel them.

01:51.958 --> 01:53.958
- The pearls.
- Good. That's it.

01:54.916 --> 01:56.041
[Berlin sighs]

01:56.875 --> 01:58.000
[smacks lips, exhales]

01:58.000 --> 02:00.208
[gently] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:00.708 --> 02:03.000
Bruce, you see,
champagne is a sparkling wine.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.708
Once it's open,
it begins to lose its essence.

02:07.708 --> 02:10.250
[quietly] I'm afraid I must insist.
Finish the bottle.

02:52.791 --> 02:55.125
[exhales]

02:58.333 --> 02:59.958
Can we get back to the plan now?

02:59.958 --> 03:03.541
- Or would you like something to drink?
- No. I'm good, thanks.

03:05.875 --> 03:07.208
[tense music continues]

03:07.208 --> 03:09.958
Psst. Take this, or you might get sick.

03:09.958 --> 03:13.416
I can understand that you might confuse
what's going on here with a classroom.

03:13.416 --> 03:15.333
You can get up and walk around.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.916
You can throw chalk. Or open the fridge.

03:17.916 --> 03:22.291
And the reason it feels like a classroom
is because we are studying a plan.

03:22.291 --> 03:24.708
However, there is
a significant difference.

03:24.708 --> 03:26.291
Quite an important detail.

03:26.291 --> 03:27.625
If someone screws up,

03:27.625 --> 03:29.541
if you screw up,

03:29.541 --> 03:32.375
they don't just ask you
to stay after school.

03:32.375 --> 03:33.541
They send you to prison.

03:33.541 --> 03:36.208
And in France,
that means 16 years behind bars.

03:36.208 --> 03:40.750
So anyone who ignores the plan
is putting all of our lives at risk.

03:40.750 --> 03:41.666
Understood?

who has helped me mastermind other heists,

04:38.625 --> 04:40.750
"A robbery's not a plan."

"A robbery is a curriculum."

[nostalgic piano rendition

- [chuckles]
- And why isn't your friend here with us?

04:47.708 --> 04:49.708
He's working on his own heist.

04:49.708 --> 04:52.208
- And... it's going to be amazing.
- [Damián sighs]

04:52.208 --> 04:54.750
In fact, he's spent
half of his life preparing for it.

04:54.750 --> 04:56.291
But that's a good question.

04:56.791 --> 04:57.916
I'm sure you're wondering why

04:57.916 --> 05:00.125
I haven't hired seasoned,
professional thieves

05:00.125 --> 05:03.541
with 20 years of experience,
and instead, I have you.

05:03.541 --> 05:06.041
There are two good reasons for that.

05:06.541 --> 05:10.958
The first reason
is that this heist needs only one brain,

05:10.958 --> 05:12.333
Damián's.

05:12.333 --> 05:14.916
And the second is because,

05:14.916 --> 05:18.166
for pros, it's always
about their egos and not the excitement.

05:18.166 --> 05:21.583
Well, there's only one ego here,
and that's mine. [chuckles]

05:21.583 --> 05:23.708
And the excitement is all yours.

05:23.708 --> 05:28.333
You cannot imagine how sad it is
to work with people hardened by apathy.

05:28.333 --> 05:31.916
Whereas you, my young friends
are so wonderfully malleable,

05:31.916 --> 05:35.000
you can listen and learn
from everything I teach you.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.291
You'll become stronger.

05:36.291 --> 05:37.666
For example, Bruce.

05:37.666 --> 05:40.333
He will never ever interrupt
a class again, will you, Bruce?

05:40.333 --> 05:41.333
No, sir.

05:41.916 --> 05:44.791
But most importantly for me,
and this would be our third reason,

05:44.791 --> 05:48.333
is because, when you are surrounded
by young people,

05:48.333 --> 05:49.583
you feel invigorated.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.916
Right, Damián?

05:52.250 --> 05:53.666
[chuckles]

05:53.666 --> 05:56.541
Your enthusiasm, your vitality,

05:56.541 --> 05:57.625
your beauty.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.250
All these things
that make life worth living.

06:00.250 --> 06:04.375
That's why I prepare my plans
in the suite of a five-star luxury hotel.

06:04.375 --> 06:06.875
Not a hangar or some house in suburbia,

06:06.875 --> 06:10.250
like some badly dressed thief,
hiding in the dark like a rat.

06:10.250 --> 06:14.250
Because, if we are to end
bullet-ridden on the streets of Paris,

06:14.250 --> 06:16.916
our bodies will be beautiful to behold.

06:18.041 --> 06:19.166
Even Damián's.

06:19.958 --> 06:21.833
Thank you for the compliment, I guess.

06:22.500 --> 06:25.000
And now, unless someone else cares
to interrupt...

06:27.708 --> 06:29.541
Keila, kindly proceed.

06:29.541 --> 06:31.000
What happens when you take control

06:31.000 --> 06:33.458
of the security cameras
at the auction house?

06:33.458 --> 06:34.458
As I was saying,

06:34.458 --> 06:37.166
<i>I'll record footage
of the empty vault and antechamber</i>

06:37.166 --> 06:38.708

06:43.041 --> 06:45.375
<i>of the empty rooms
on the security guards' monitors.</i>

06:46.333 --> 06:50.125
And what if Mr. Polignac
enters the vault to put away some jewels?

06:50.125 --> 06:51.458
What happens then?

06:51.458 --> 06:53.916
We let the cameras record it in real time.

06:53.916 --> 06:55.375
And if it's not Polignac?

06:55.375 --> 06:56.958
If it's one of us? What then?

06:56.958 --> 07:00.208
Then I play back the recording.
The guards will just see an empty vault.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.458
Okay, play back.

I'm quite the poet, huh? [laughs]

07:27.916 --> 07:30.958
Once inside the antechamber,
we remove the back wall of the vault

07:30.958 --> 07:33.375
by cutting along the joints
that hold it together.

07:33.375 --> 07:37.000
One clean cut that will slice
through a seven-ton slab of steel.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.666
How do we slice through steel that thick?

ever invented.</i>

07:45.833 --> 07:47.000
But imagine this.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.708
A cutting wire as precise as any diamond.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.583
And a two-pole electromagnetic motor.

of 40 meters per second.</i>

This will be our slicing system.

08:04.416 --> 08:07.833
[dramatic string music playing]

08:12.000 --> 08:13.583
Connect the crane to the slab.

08:13.583 --> 08:15.916
<i>Then we weld together the magnetic hooks</i>

08:15.916 --> 08:18.791
<i>so that the crane
can lift the slab about 50 centimeters.</i>

08:18.791 --> 08:21.750
- And where will the crane be?
- Right here. Just above the vault.

08:21.750 --> 08:24.666
The iron structure will hide
the two pulleys that we'll set up below.

08:24.666 --> 08:28.625
Then using a remote control, the crane
will lift the slab off the ground,

08:28.625 --> 08:30.125
just like a garage door,

08:30.125 --> 08:33.250
Leaving us just enough room
to slide inside.

Look at me. Go. I got this.

[tense music continues]

12:34.333 --> 12:36.083
Monsieur Martínez,

12:36.083 --> 12:39.416
I'd like to introduce you
to my husband, Monsieur Polignac.

12:39.416 --> 12:40.333
What a coincidence,

12:40.333 --> 12:42.708
running into each other
at the same restaurant.

12:43.750 --> 12:44.791
Pleased to meet you.

12:44.791 --> 12:46.750
[Camille] Mr. Martínez
is a Spanish art dealer.

12:46.750 --> 12:50.166
Do you remember?
I said we... were having lunch today.

12:50.666 --> 12:51.708
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

12:52.583 --> 12:54.333
Would you mind if he joins us?

12:55.375 --> 12:57.250
[tense music rising]

13:02.125 --> 13:04.083
[tense music swells]

13:06.708 --> 13:07.875
Is there a problem?

13:07.875 --> 13:09.208
Am I annoying you?

13:09.208 --> 13:12.083
Was it something that I said?
Or maybe it's worse.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.791
Maybe you're so self-absorbed,
and me being the gentleman that I am,

13:14.791 --> 13:16.791
you believe that I'm trying to seduce you.

13:16.791 --> 13:19.166
I'm sorry, but I don't understand
what you're saying,

13:19.166 --> 13:21.541
- Or what you're implying.
- [Berlin] Well, it's quite simple.

13:21.541 --> 13:23.666
There's really no need
to call in your chaperone.

13:23.666 --> 13:24.833
I can leave on my own.

13:24.833 --> 13:28.458
I'm a respected art dealer.
I came here to discuss business,

13:28.458 --> 13:30.375
not to get inside your panties.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.791
Hey, <i>torero.</i> Enough.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.916
You're way outta line.

13:36.625 --> 13:39.458
[echoing] Don't make a scene.
We're in the middle of a restaurant.

13:52.541 --> 13:55.000
[quietly] Ah... Of course.

13:55.583 --> 13:57.541
Enjoy your little chitchat.

[both laugh]

14:15.958 --> 14:18.250
What did I just do? [chuckles]

14:18.916 --> 14:20.583
You can't imagine how anxious I was.

14:21.375 --> 14:23.041
I could feel my head pounding,

14:23.708 --> 14:25.291
I was completely paralyzed.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.291
And all I could think of was,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.416
what if my panties
flew out of your pocket?

14:30.416 --> 14:32.958
- [laughs] Oh, darling.
- I must be insane.

14:33.625 --> 14:36.000
I feel guilty
about cheating on François like that.

14:36.583 --> 14:39.708
But at the same time,
it's so exhilarating.

14:41.541 --> 14:42.791
Let's leave Paris.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.708
Let's go to a castle or a spa. Anywhere.

14:45.708 --> 14:48.833
For the weekend. Just the two of us.

14:48.833 --> 14:49.958
[tender music playing]

14:49.958 --> 14:52.833
We can pretend
the rest of the world doesn't exist.

14:53.458 --> 14:54.583
I don't have any clothes.

14:54.583 --> 14:57.958
Darling, we're in Paris,
the capital of prêt-à-porter.

14:57.958 --> 15:00.375
Do I need to remind you
that you need new underwear?

15:00.375 --> 15:02.833
- [quietly] Give me that.
- [laughs]

15:02.833 --> 15:04.000
[chuckles]

15:04.916 --> 15:06.375
What do I say to François?

15:07.083 --> 15:10.250
We were going to spend a few days together
at our cottage in Chantilly.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.291
[inhales sharply]

15:13.916 --> 15:17.083
Tell him that you have to leave suddenly
for business.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.625
And that you don't even have time
to go home.

15:19.625 --> 15:22.083
- [tender music continues]
- [chuckles, sighs]

15:22.750 --> 15:24.583
Do you remember when I told you

15:25.083 --> 15:30.166
that sometimes I'm afraid
to sleep at night in case life passes by?

15:32.500 --> 15:34.250
Well, I don't feel that anymore.

15:34.833 --> 15:39.875
Now I feel that...
I'm living the life that I always wanted.

15:41.333 --> 15:42.208
And it's with you.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.916

15:43.916 --> 15:46.208
Of the eight billion people in this world,

15:47.291 --> 15:48.333
here we are.

15:48.833 --> 15:49.750
You and me.

15:53.041 --> 15:54.291

16:01.666 --> 16:02.750
[Keila] Cheers, everyone!

16:02.750 --> 16:04.500
- [all chuckle]
- Ooh!

16:05.000 --> 16:08.375
I came here for the first time,
many years ago, with my wife.

16:08.875 --> 16:12.208
In an old Citroën, and since then,
we've become Francophiles.

16:12.708 --> 16:14.375
Uh, fresh baguette every day.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.375
- Uh, croissants for breakfast.
- <i>Merci.</i>

16:16.375 --> 16:18.500
And a bottle of Burgundy
when we can afford it.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.375

- Looks good. Can I?

16:20.375 --> 16:21.833

16:29.541 --> 16:31.416
Can I get an advance on my share?

16:31.416 --> 16:32.666
[Damián] What for?

16:32.666 --> 16:34.958
[Cameron] There's
this four-day electronic music festival

16:34.958 --> 16:36.375
happening in New Orleans.

16:36.375 --> 16:38.500
- [chuckles]
- I'd love to go and have some fun.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.291
To New Orleans?
You do know where New Orleans is?

16:42.208 --> 16:44.916
One hour on a bus
or 20 on a plane, it's all the same to me.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.291
If it's for a good cause.

16:46.291 --> 16:49.500
- And what's the good cause?
- To have fun.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.916
Absurd adventures
with unpredictable endings.

16:52.875 --> 16:53.750
Come with me.

16:54.541 --> 16:55.958
Paris, New Orleans.

16:55.958 --> 16:57.333
They go well together.

16:57.333 --> 16:58.875
[tense music building]

17:02.375 --> 17:05.458
Well, personally, I prefer to know
how my adventures end.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.166
You're not much fun.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.208
Ooh!

17:10.208 --> 17:13.000
- [laughs]
- [Keila] Oh! [chuckles]

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Well, if we don't go to New Orleans,
we can stay and celebrate in Paris.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.625
- That calls for champagne.
- [Cameron] Yes, champagne.

17:19.208 --> 17:21.208
I think I'll pass
on the champagne this time.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.791
[Damián and Cameron laugh]

17:27.666 --> 17:29.083
Too bad for you, man.

- Shh, everyone.

17:37.708 --> 17:38.625
It's my wife.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.500
You're all students
from the Sorbonne, okay?

17:40.500 --> 17:42.583
Start speaking French. Oh, hi darling.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.625
- How are you?
- [wife] <i>Hi, Damián.</i>

17:44.625 --> 17:47.083
You just caught me having a drink
with some of my students

17:48.541 --> 17:50.083

18:01.333 --> 18:03.541
How come you speak such good French?

18:03.541 --> 18:06.000
When I was a child,
I lived here for a while with my family.

18:06.000 --> 18:06.958
Amazing.

18:06.958 --> 18:09.291
Paris is so beautiful at the moment.

18:09.291 --> 18:11.208
And as romantic as always.

18:11.208 --> 18:12.291
Listen. I have an idea.

18:12.291 --> 18:15.625
When I finish my lectures,
why don't we meet up here?

18:15.625 --> 18:16.875
Hmm?

18:16.875 --> 18:18.541

- [Damián] <i>Yeah.</i>

18:26.208 --> 18:28.041
But it was worth it. Hmm?

18:30.166 --> 18:31.833
- I've been thinking.
- Mm-hmm?

18:31.833 --> 18:34.291
<i>And it wasn't easy
to reach this decision, but...</i>

18:35.500 --> 18:37.500

what you're thinking.

18:52.208 --> 18:54.458
I think it too sometimes.

Your seminars, your work with NGOs...</i>

I mean, you've always said
that I was the love of your life.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.458
And you were mine.
We said it to each other,

23:24.083 --> 23:25.833
What about the Titanic?

23:25.833 --> 23:27.083
<i>Titanic.</i>

23:27.583 --> 23:29.041
Now <i>that's</i> love.

23:29.916 --> 23:32.500
It starts
with you dancing happily together

23:33.000 --> 23:35.208
and ends in the depths
of the Mariana Trench.

23:36.041 --> 23:38.125
And your life depends on a piece of wood.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.333
One of you hangs on for dear life,
freezing to death,

23:40.333 --> 23:42.458
while the other drops
to the bottom of the ocean.

23:42.458 --> 23:45.166
The dinners and the romance.

23:45.166 --> 23:46.708
Sex in the back seat.

23:46.708 --> 23:49.625
Steamy windows with your hands
pressed against the glass.

23:49.625 --> 23:51.791
A few good moments before the disaster.

23:51.791 --> 23:55.083
You sound as if you're 50
with three divorces and two hernias.

23:55.083 --> 23:57.250
[both chuckle]

23:57.250 --> 23:58.583
Did he hurt you that much?

23:58.583 --> 24:00.541
[somber piano music continues]

24:01.625 --> 24:02.833
[softly] Just a little.

24:03.958 --> 24:05.625
I guess that's what I earned.

24:05.625 --> 24:07.375
Wisdom through pain.

24:08.333 --> 24:09.375
I learned that,

24:09.375 --> 24:12.416
if you survived the Titanic,
you don't have to go back.

24:12.416 --> 24:14.291
No. That's not wisdom.

24:14.291 --> 24:17.708
That's just surrender.
And I'm not giving up.

24:17.708 --> 24:22.041
I'll go back to Spain and remind her
why I'm the love of her life.

24:22.041 --> 24:24.125
Okay. But just one piece of advice.

24:24.916 --> 24:27.500
Make sure that she's alone
when you show up.

24:28.583 --> 24:30.166
What are you trying to tell me?

24:30.666 --> 24:32.125
Listen, Damián.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.041
[clicks tongue] No matter how good
your story was, it's all over now.

24:37.041 --> 24:38.583
Your wife has moved on.

24:39.166 --> 24:41.625
And to enjoy her new love,
she must get rid of her guilt.

24:41.625 --> 24:44.041
That's why she broke up
with you over the phone.

24:45.125 --> 24:46.625
I hope I'm wrong.

24:46.625 --> 24:49.875
Otherwise, as I said, welcome to the club.

24:49.875 --> 24:51.708
[sighs sadly] Stay here.

24:51.708 --> 24:54.041
Keep watching and finish the pizza.

24:54.041 --> 24:55.291
I need time to think.

[Polignac on headphones] <i>Everything
was ready when you got there?</i>

25:04.166 --> 25:06.083
<i>Okay, so we need to make sure</i>

25:06.083 --> 25:08.625
<i>that all the paperwork
is completed for the insurance.</i>

25:08.625 --> 25:12.208
<i>The documents have to be in order
for the signature. It's important, okay?</i>

25:12.208 --> 25:15.041
<i>Yes. As I said in my email,
they've been delivered.</i>

[Camille] I love this place.

25:28.625 --> 25:29.916
I feel at peace here.

25:31.208 --> 25:32.416
[Berlin sighs]

25:32.416 --> 25:35.416
There's so many places
in Paris I'd like to show you.

25:35.916 --> 25:37.833
There's the Japanese garden,

25:37.833 --> 25:41.000
where you can lose yourself
and forget about the world.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.125
[chuckles softly] And the Barbès market,

25:43.125 --> 25:45.500
where the farmers
sell really good local wines

25:45.500 --> 25:46.541
and artisanal cheeses.

25:46.541 --> 25:47.791
Do you like cheese?

25:47.791 --> 25:50.916
- I would die for cheese.
- [laughs]

25:52.375 --> 25:56.041
Sometimes they even bring sheep. [laughs]

25:56.541 --> 25:58.875
And there's this traditional, old café.

26:00.375 --> 26:02.541
[sighs] They brew
this really wonderful coffee.

26:02.541 --> 26:04.166
It's so pretty there.

26:04.166 --> 26:06.458
And they have
this beautiful nickel countertop

26:06.458 --> 26:08.000
and banquettes...

26:08.833 --> 26:10.750
[Berlin] I love places like that.

26:11.333 --> 26:14.791
Whenever I'm in Madrid,
I always go to the same place.

26:14.791 --> 26:16.625
The Buenos Aires Café.

26:16.625 --> 26:19.708
The best Brazilian beans,
freshly roasted in Buenos Aires.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.708
[both chuckle]

26:22.291 --> 26:23.250
[Camille sighs]

26:25.916 --> 26:29.916
Simón, can you stay for a few more days?

26:32.416 --> 26:35.000
[gentle instrumental music playing]

26:36.833 --> 26:38.500
[softly] Of course I can stay.

26:39.916 --> 26:41.208
I'd drop everything.

26:41.208 --> 26:43.625
My house, my job, my friends.

26:46.291 --> 26:49.500
Who wants all that
if I can have a life in Paris with you?

26:50.958 --> 26:52.125
Are you serious?

26:53.583 --> 26:54.833
[gently] Of course.

26:57.333 --> 26:58.375
I'd love that.

27:02.375 --> 27:04.208
[gentle music continues]

27:04.208 --> 27:06.208
[cell phone vibrating]

27:08.375 --> 27:09.750
[gentle music fades]

27:11.791 --> 27:13.000
It's François.

27:13.875 --> 27:15.500
Do you mind if I answer?

27:15.500 --> 27:17.208
No. Of course not.

27:21.083 --> 27:22.208
François?

27:22.708 --> 27:24.958
[Polignac] <i>Camille, are you alone
on your trip?</i>

27:24.958 --> 27:27.291
[ominous instrumental music playing]

27:28.125 --> 27:30.666
You left your email open on your laptop.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.666
<i>I've been having a very stressful day,</i>

27:34.666 --> 27:37.583
with all the jewels arriving
at the auction house.

27:37.583 --> 27:39.041
[takes a deep breath]

27:39.041 --> 27:41.625
So I came back home to change my clothes,

27:41.625 --> 27:44.083
<i>and I found your laptop open.</i>

27:45.291 --> 27:46.916
<i>I read your love letters.</i>

27:48.291 --> 27:51.916
How he makes you feel something
you haven't felt in years.

27:52.666 --> 27:54.791
<i>And the songs that you sent him.</i>

27:54.791 --> 27:58.416
The same songs we listened to together.

27:58.416 --> 27:59.958
[somber string music playing]

27:59.958 --> 28:01.708
<i>And from what I can see,</i>

28:01.708 --> 28:05.125
<i>you've been taking him
to all the same places we went to.</i>

28:05.125 --> 28:06.625
<i>And then I saw his name.</i>

28:06.625 --> 28:08.291
<i>Monsieur Martínez,</i>

28:08.791 --> 28:11.458
the Spanish art dealer
from the restaurant.

28:12.166 --> 28:13.208
François.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.291
Can we talk this over calmly together?

28:17.291 --> 28:18.375
[call disconnects]

28:23.958 --> 28:26.125
[gasps softly] He's read all our messages.

28:26.750 --> 28:28.375
He's seen everything.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.833
I need to speak to him.

28:32.333 --> 28:34.500
Could you give me some time on my own?

28:34.500 --> 28:36.166
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

28:36.166 --> 28:38.541
Just call me
when you want me to come back.

28:41.250 --> 28:44.916
- [somber music fades]
- [triumphant orchestral music playing]

28:45.916 --> 28:47.791

28:47.791 --> 28:50.583
One thrust to the heart, <i>torero</i>!

Let's see who's out of line now, François.

29:13.291 --> 29:14.666
Good morning, ladies.

29:14.666 --> 29:17.125
We're a player short.
Would you care to join us?

29:17.125 --> 29:20.000
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I would love to join your table, ladies.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.625
However, I'm having a heart attack.
Attacked by love.

29:23.625 --> 29:26.041
- I must run. I bid you farewell.
- Mm.

29:26.041 --> 29:27.583
Run along, then.

29:28.083 --> 29:31.208
- Run, young man! [chuckles]
- [Berlin] Au revoir! [laughs]

29:31.208 --> 29:33.125
What a charming young man.

Come in. The rooms are nonsmoking,

- [energetic music playing]
- [Damián] You were right.

30:11.791 --> 30:13.416
My wife's having an affair.

30:13.416 --> 30:15.875
Some details had escaped my attention.

30:15.875 --> 30:18.041
For Easter week, she went to Seville.

30:18.041 --> 30:21.125
She said she was going
with a girlfriend to see the processions.

30:21.125 --> 30:22.375
But look at this.

30:22.875 --> 30:24.791
She's dressed up
like she's going to the opera.

30:24.791 --> 30:27.125
And her hair
is definitely looking more blonde.

30:27.125 --> 30:30.791
And this photo with her friend?
That's no selfie. And what's that mean?

30:30.791 --> 30:33.083
It means they're with someone else.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.625
That summer, she went to visit
her mother at the beach house.

30:37.625 --> 30:39.750
Carmen always wears a one-piece. Always.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.708
See? Five years ago. Four.

30:41.708 --> 30:43.833
Three. And the summer that I'm not there?

30:43.833 --> 30:46.041
She wears a bikini. And a sarong.

30:46.041 --> 30:48.708
And she even has a fucking flower
in her hair.

30:48.708 --> 30:52.375
Who dresses up like a Hawaiian
just to play backgammon with their mother?

30:52.375 --> 30:53.583
[sighs]

30:53.583 --> 30:57.041
And twice that week, she completely forgot
to send me a good-night message.

30:57.041 --> 30:59.000
"This guy's nuts," you're thinking.
Not true!

30:59.000 --> 31:01.333
For the last 20 years, we say good night.

31:01.333 --> 31:03.416
And what's more, for the past year,

31:03.416 --> 31:05.958
she's been posting
a lot of stuff on Facebook.

31:05.958 --> 31:10.166
And I found someone
called Jackal70... who likes it all.

31:10.166 --> 31:11.666
Everything she posts!

31:11.666 --> 31:14.041
Like, like, like, like.

31:14.041 --> 31:16.541
And one day,
her picture gets a fire emoji.

31:16.541 --> 31:20.583
Jackal70 posts a fire emoji?

31:20.583 --> 31:22.041
And look at this.

31:22.041 --> 31:23.666
We have a family phone plan.

31:23.666 --> 31:26.583
And for the past ten months,
there's a new number on the bill.

31:26.583 --> 31:29.500
At first I thought it was one
of her relatives. She has a shitload.

31:29.500 --> 31:32.041
But then I noticed something strange.

31:32.041 --> 31:34.250
She only calls that number when I'm away.

31:34.250 --> 31:36.875
For example, I was with her
from January to March,

31:36.875 --> 31:39.041
and from July to September,
and she didn't call.

31:39.041 --> 31:40.958
But on October 13th,

31:41.458 --> 31:43.708
at 8:16, she made a call

31:43.708 --> 31:46.208
to that same number
that lasted 47 minutes.

31:47.291 --> 31:48.583
Nothing unusual.

31:48.583 --> 31:52.333
Except for the fact that I was boarding
a plane to Paris at eight.

31:52.333 --> 31:54.083
So she dropped me at the airport.

31:54.083 --> 31:56.375
[tense, energetic music continues]

31:56.375 --> 32:00.916
She dropped me like a dog on the roadside
and called that fuckin' number.

32:00.916 --> 32:02.458
[paper crumples]

32:02.458 --> 32:04.250
[Damián] And the irrefutable evidence.

32:04.250 --> 32:07.583
That same night,
I received a message telling me

32:08.500 --> 32:11.291
of an expense of 178 euros.

32:11.291 --> 32:12.791
So, I searched the internet.

32:14.041 --> 32:15.375
It's a restaurant.

32:16.708 --> 32:18.291
"Fleur de Chacal."

32:18.291 --> 32:20.333
Jackal. Once again.

32:20.333 --> 32:22.916
Do you know what "jackal" means in Mexico?

32:23.500 --> 32:26.041
A womanizer, a man possessed by lust.

32:27.833 --> 32:31.875
Who spends 178 euros in a Mexican joint?

32:34.125 --> 32:36.375
There was tequila! And jackal-action!

32:36.375 --> 32:37.791
[softly] That's enough.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.416
[grunts]

32:42.083 --> 32:44.625
- What are you doing here?
- The jewels have arrived.

32:44.625 --> 32:45.791
What day is today?

32:45.791 --> 32:48.583
Monday. But there's something
that you need to know.

32:49.083 --> 32:51.291
Tomorrow they're taking
the jewels out to be appraised.

32:51.291 --> 32:53.750
And on Wednesday,
there's a press conference.

32:53.750 --> 32:54.958
That changes the plan.

32:54.958 --> 32:58.333
- And the auction is the day after.
- We have to move now.

32:58.333 --> 33:00.250
We have to steal them tonight.

[laughs] <i>Roi, I've got some great news.
She wants me to stay in Paris.</i>

33:14.250 --> 33:16.125
And her husband just found out about us.

33:16.125 --> 33:19.666
She was still sweating from our lovemaking
when he called. [laughs]

33:19.666 --> 33:22.041
Who are you talking about?
Polignac, the auction guy?

33:22.041 --> 33:23.958
<i>Roi, for the moment,
forget about the auction.</i>

33:23.958 --> 33:27.625
I'm talking about my personal life.
Forget the professional stuff!

33:27.625 --> 33:31.083
That guy, he read all of our letters.

[scoffs] <i>All I have to do now is wait
for him to push her into my open arms.</i>

33:36.750 --> 33:40.000

Roi, I'm staying here for a long weekend.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.166
<i>That won't be possible.</i>

33:41.166 --> 33:43.916
That's why I'm calling.
We have to do the job today.

33:43.916 --> 33:44.875
Why today?

<i>and after that,

Are you okay?

34:19.000 --> 34:21.083
I understand completely.

34:22.166 --> 34:24.416
- It's tough on him.
- He was so shocked.

34:26.208 --> 34:28.416
It's been very painful for both of us.

34:28.416 --> 34:33.000
If you don't mind me asking...
what did you tell him, darling?

34:33.000 --> 34:34.083
Everything.

34:36.541 --> 34:38.833
How we walked along
the banks of the Seine.

34:39.791 --> 34:41.166
[chuckles sadly]

34:41.666 --> 34:46.916
How we rode the streets on a Vespa,
stopping to kiss at every traffic light.

34:48.416 --> 34:49.791
[chuckles softly]

34:50.291 --> 34:53.250
And that you make
the best margaritas in Paris. [chuckles]

34:53.250 --> 34:54.416
[Berlin exhales]

34:55.125 --> 34:56.458
How we never sleep.

34:57.541 --> 34:59.333
How we spend the whole night making love.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.375
And what did he say to you?

35:04.291 --> 35:05.750
That he would've done the same.

35:05.750 --> 35:08.875
That when you get caught up
in a whirlwind of love,

35:09.583 --> 35:11.333
there's nothing you can do.

35:11.333 --> 35:13.291
[tense strings playing]

35:13.291 --> 35:15.500
And if that's how I feel, then do it.

35:15.500 --> 35:18.250
And what exactly does that mean?

35:18.250 --> 35:23.583
I don't know. I suppose... he wanted to say
that he won't stand in our way.

35:24.583 --> 35:26.208
He's such a good man.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.708
[tense, dramatic music building]

35:30.875 --> 35:32.291
He said he wants to get to know you.

35:33.583 --> 35:35.375
He wants to get to know me? François?

35:35.375 --> 35:36.458
[phone ringing]

35:36.458 --> 35:38.583
[Camille] Yes, François.

35:40.291 --> 35:42.125
[call disconnects]

35:43.916 --> 35:46.500
Well, now that he knows
you're the man from the restaurant,

35:46.500 --> 35:49.000
he feels guilty for calling you "<i>torero</i>."

35:49.708 --> 35:50.791
He wants to make amends.

35:50.791 --> 35:52.750
Wow. [gasps softly]

35:52.750 --> 35:56.416
He's so considerate, your François.

35:56.416 --> 35:59.750
I mean, not everyone
would be so... understanding

35:59.750 --> 36:01.708
about their wife leaving them
for another man.

36:01.708 --> 36:02.958
[sighs]

36:06.666 --> 36:08.458
[exhales deeply]

36:08.458 --> 36:09.583
Sit down.

36:13.333 --> 36:14.541
[exhales]

36:15.791 --> 36:19.625
My love, this is not about choosing.

36:20.375 --> 36:23.333
I'm sorry if I've misled you, but...

36:24.500 --> 36:25.666
I'm not leaving François.

36:27.750 --> 36:31.250
We've been together for eight years.
He's... my soulmate.

36:32.041 --> 36:33.250
[sighs]

36:34.875 --> 36:37.500
Uh, to be honest, you did mislead me. Um...

36:38.791 --> 36:42.500
I'm trying to understand my place,
and, um, I'm not quite sure I get it.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.541
You are the attraction.

36:45.375 --> 36:46.958
You're the infatuation.

36:47.458 --> 36:50.416
The fireworks you feel
at the beginning of a relationship.

36:50.416 --> 36:55.041
I had those feelings for him too,
and then it became real love.

36:55.833 --> 36:57.875
And I don't believe
I'll ever give that up.

37:00.291 --> 37:01.875
Do you know what he said?

37:02.458 --> 37:03.458
[exhales]

37:03.458 --> 37:06.708
That for the past three weeks,
he's been thinking about having a child.

37:08.791 --> 37:10.041
[quietly] Is that right?

37:11.250 --> 37:15.458
And suddenly, this burning passion
of ours just appeared.

37:16.166 --> 37:18.958
[sighs] So unexpectedly in our lives.

37:19.458 --> 37:24.125
I've been asking him for years,
and it was never the right time.

37:24.666 --> 37:26.500
And now that he's made up his mind,

37:27.208 --> 37:28.666
I fall in love with you.

37:29.375 --> 37:30.750
[exhales]

37:32.083 --> 37:33.333
It's okay. Don't worry.

37:33.833 --> 37:36.291
But, honestly, all of this
has kind of confused me.

37:36.291 --> 37:39.291
I'll need some time to absorb all this.

37:39.291 --> 37:42.583
I need some rest.
We've had some long nights recently.

37:43.083 --> 37:46.833
I think I need... to think for a while.

37:49.166 --> 37:52.125
Would it bother you if I got myself
another room for tonight?

37:52.708 --> 37:55.083
[quietly] Of course. Sure.

37:55.916 --> 37:56.875
[sighs]

37:57.666 --> 38:00.875
[dramatic string music playing]

38:00.875 --> 38:03.041
- Simón, wait.
- Hmm?

38:04.000 --> 38:05.291
Breakfast tomorrow?

38:07.000 --> 38:08.125
[quietly] Of course.

38:09.166 --> 38:10.708
[chuckles softly]

38:14.000 --> 38:17.583
[dramatic music fades]

38:17.583 --> 38:20.166
[tense, energetic music pulsing]

38:27.166 --> 38:28.875
[cell phone rings]

38:29.958 --> 38:31.208
[call connects]

38:31.208 --> 38:32.291
Yes, Roi?

38:33.791 --> 38:35.000
I'm on my way. What is it?

38:35.000 --> 38:39.250
Okay. Okay. Um...
Well, it's that Damián's a little nervous.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.708
<i>He says he called you,
but you didn't answer.</i>

38:42.291 --> 38:44.416
But if you're on your way, just forget it.

38:44.416 --> 38:45.458
[sighs]

38:47.041 --> 38:48.083
You all right?

38:48.083 --> 38:49.833
Actually, no, Roi. No.

38:50.541 --> 38:51.875
I'm not all right.

38:51.875 --> 38:53.833
I'm just her second fiddle.

38:53.833 --> 38:55.125
<i>She says she's in love with me,</i>

38:55.125 --> 38:57.500
but that she's going
to stay with her husband.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.791
Can you understand that?

38:59.291 --> 39:00.666
- It's strange.
<i>- Tell me about it.</i>

39:00.666 --> 39:03.833
She says I'm her infatuation.
I'm the fireworks.

39:03.833 --> 39:06.166
But her husband is her soulmate.

39:06.166 --> 39:08.041
I'll checkmate him, the bastard!

39:09.458 --> 39:12.166
I used to be the secret second fiddle.

39:12.166 --> 39:15.333
By use of cloak-and-dagger
and clever subterfuge,

39:15.333 --> 39:16.750
I cuckolded the fool.

39:16.750 --> 39:19.208
And now, what am I? A wuss.

39:19.208 --> 39:21.125
<i>I'm her booty call. Can you believe it?</i>

39:21.875 --> 39:23.541
Can you think of anything more insulting?

39:23.541 --> 39:27.250
The guy has basically given me
a free pass to sleep with his wife.

39:27.250 --> 39:29.875
Fuck the Frenchies
and their polyamory and free love.

39:29.875 --> 39:31.208
Fuck all that shit!

39:33.041 --> 39:34.041
[quietly] Okay.

39:36.208 --> 39:39.458
You always said to keep our personal
and professional lives separate.

39:39.458 --> 39:42.125
Right now, yours are all mixed up. So...

39:42.125 --> 39:43.875
[tense music playing]

39:43.875 --> 39:45.375
...maybe you should forget about her.

39:47.250 --> 39:48.333
Forget her?

39:50.416 --> 39:51.666
It's too late, Roi.

39:51.666 --> 39:53.083
<i>I've only known her for two weeks,</i>

39:53.083 --> 39:54.916
<i>but that woman
has completely swept me away.</i>

39:56.541 --> 39:57.750
And you know what's worse?

39:57.750 --> 40:00.125
Now she says she's going to have a baby.

40:00.125 --> 40:01.166
You got her pregnant?

40:01.166 --> 40:02.458
Come on, Roi. No.

40:03.041 --> 40:05.833
She's wanted one for years.
Her husband didn't.

40:05.833 --> 40:07.875
He just couldn't find the right moment.

40:07.875 --> 40:10.208
And so now, that piece of shit

40:10.208 --> 40:13.125
<i>wants to get her pregnant
just so that she can't leave him.</i>

40:13.125 --> 40:14.750
That phony son of a bitch!

40:14.750 --> 40:17.416
You gotta be a real lowlife
to use a baby like that!

40:17.416 --> 40:19.375
And he plays the nice-guy card,

40:19.375 --> 40:22.500
and then he throws a royal flush
of embryos on the table.

40:22.500 --> 40:24.166
Well, let me tell you something, Roi.

40:24.166 --> 40:26.375
I'm not leaving her with that asshole!

40:27.208 --> 40:28.458
<i>Listen carefully, okay?</i>

40:28.458 --> 40:31.916
Go get acetone and some bleach.
We're going to make chloroform.

40:32.416 --> 40:36.583
That punk Polignac
has no fucking idea who he's dealing with!

40:37.250 --> 40:40.041
<i>He thinks he's playing with a piñata,
but he's gonna get hit</i>

40:40.041 --> 40:42.291
by a 300-megaton bomb!

40:42.291 --> 40:44.083
- [call disconnects]
- [line beeps]

40:44.083 --> 40:45.958
[tense, energetic music continues]

40:49.625 --> 40:50.833
[under breath] Fuck.

40:50.833 --> 40:51.833
[music ends]

40:51.833 --> 40:54.000
[jubilant choir music playing]
