00:01.468 --> 00:03.103
<i>Previously, on "Being Mary Jane"...</i>

00:03.169 --> 00:04.738
- Do you love her?
- I do.

00:04.804 --> 00:07.207
Would you still love her
if she wasn't the anchor?

00:07.273 --> 00:10.677
- I love her, not what she does.
- Simone worried about that with you.

00:10.744 --> 00:13.179
- Please don't go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.347
This is for you.

00:15.148 --> 00:18.218
Garrett convinced the brass
to give me a vote on his replacement.

00:18.284 --> 00:20.987
Wait. So you have to choose
between Kara and Justin?

00:21.054 --> 00:24.591
Either my best friend or my boyfriend
is gonna end up hating me.

00:30.397 --> 00:31.798
God...

00:37.303 --> 00:40.607
You know, if you keep impugning
my authority in front of our staffers,

00:40.673 --> 00:42.809
I might write you up
for insubordination.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.278
Everyone knows
I don't kowtow to anyone,

00:45.345 --> 00:47.046
not even my husband.

00:47.113 --> 00:49.115
I'm also your executive producer.

00:51.117 --> 00:53.052
Well, Mr. Executive Producer...

00:54.154 --> 00:56.156
Are you sure
there isn't anything I can do

00:56.222 --> 00:58.324
to convince you to see things my way?

01:11.171 --> 01:12.939
You don't fight fair.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.145
Karrueche Tran is a go, everyone!

01:21.514 --> 01:22.615
Gloat all you want.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.818
You still gotta pick up J
for soccer practice.

01:26.019 --> 01:28.788
Got it? There you go.

01:30.557 --> 01:31.758
Okay...

01:36.229 --> 01:37.697
Mommy, who was that?

01:37.764 --> 01:39.666
Just somebody I used to know, baby.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.973
You okay?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.441
Yeah. Go back to sleep.

02:05.692 --> 02:06.860
Not bad.

02:06.926 --> 02:10.129
The network could not wait to tout
the show's return to #1 in the ratings.

02:10.196 --> 02:12.532
Now you've got your billboard
and I've got

02:12.599 --> 02:14.634
what gets me that corner office.

02:14.701 --> 02:16.936
Why are you showing me yesterday's news?

02:17.003 --> 02:18.605
Because I got you Prince Harry.

02:18.671 --> 02:21.808
You booked the British prince
for an interview.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.410
The British prince
and his girlfriend Meghan Markle.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.613
I've been pitching
Prince Harry for months

02:26.679 --> 02:28.581
and you always poo-poo'd it. What gives?

02:28.648 --> 02:29.883
Sawyer's still sore

02:29.949 --> 02:33.586
that GMA got the first solo interview
with the duchess a year ago.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.190
You're trying to impress the brass.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.628
This should guarantee me Garrett's job.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.401
What's got him in such a good mood

02:48.468 --> 02:49.903
and you so glum?

02:50.336 --> 02:52.839
Nothing.
So, have you got something for me?

02:52.906 --> 02:56.643
Remember how disappointed you were
that we lost the prime-time special?

02:56.709 --> 03:00.580
Well, we're still doing the special,
except we're doing it as a GDU segment.

03:00.647 --> 03:02.815
- What's the catch?
- There is no catch.

03:02.882 --> 03:04.751
We're gonna assemble a panel of women.

03:04.817 --> 03:08.221
Garrett is never going to approve
a segment about black women.

03:08.288 --> 03:09.622
It's not Black History Month.

03:09.689 --> 03:12.525
But I made him see it
as a way to capitalize

03:12.592 --> 03:14.794
on two topics
that are trending big right now.

03:15.328 --> 03:18.364
Jordan Peele's new movie,
which is all about black women,

03:18.431 --> 03:20.366
and the interest in your personal life.

03:20.433 --> 03:21.801
- Nice.
- Right?

03:21.868 --> 03:23.903
And you know what?
We won't call it a "panel."

03:23.970 --> 03:27.607
We're gonna frame it as a gathering
of women at MJ's breakfast table.

03:27.674 --> 03:29.876
- Like a mini "View."
- Exactly.

03:30.443 --> 03:32.645
- That's genius.
- Hey, somebody's gotta fill

03:32.712 --> 03:34.380
Garrett's job, so why not me?

03:36.282 --> 03:37.684
Right.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.153
<i>Look, I'm not a major Republican...</i>

03:40.219 --> 03:42.622
- Is that Dani?
- Yeah.

03:42.689 --> 03:46.025
Boy, are her followers still pissed
at her for supporting Muslims?

03:46.092 --> 03:48.361
Unfortunately, it's gotten even worse.

03:48.428 --> 03:52.532
Some conservative nut job accosted her
on her way home from work yesterday.

03:52.599 --> 03:57.236
What? My gosh, poor woman.
All she did was show a little compassion.

03:57.303 --> 04:00.373
Well, thankfully she wasn't hurt,
but we're beefing up security

04:00.440 --> 04:02.675
and providing her
an escort just to be safe.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.944
That's good,
but if she really wants this to stop,

04:05.011 --> 04:07.480
she should do what Megyn Kelly did.

04:07.547 --> 04:10.583
Have some conservative pundit
clear her name?

04:10.650 --> 04:12.585
Kiss the ring.

04:12.652 --> 04:14.654
- Yeah.
- Not a bad idea.

04:15.254 --> 04:16.956
- I'll talk to Dani about it.
- Yeah.

04:23.329 --> 04:26.065
- Paul.
- Marguerite. What a surprise.

04:26.132 --> 04:28.501
I brought you
a little something for dinner.

04:28.568 --> 04:32.005
Thank you so much, Marguerite.
That's very thoughtful of you.

04:32.071 --> 04:34.607
And I'm sure my kids and I
are gonna like it.

04:35.141 --> 04:36.242
Paul.

04:36.309 --> 04:39.445
I know when Edward passed,
Lord rest his soul,

04:40.079 --> 04:42.081
it took me a while to bounce back.

04:42.915 --> 04:44.150
Helen's not dead.

04:45.485 --> 04:46.986
I didn't mean it like that.

04:47.987 --> 04:50.289
Just know,
with everything you're going through,

04:50.356 --> 04:52.592
if you ever need a friendly ear,

04:52.659 --> 04:54.761
I am just a phone call away.

04:54.827 --> 04:57.463
I certainly will remember that.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.298
Thank you again, Marguerite.

05:02.035 --> 05:05.338
- That's Marguerite from church?
- Yeah.

05:05.405 --> 05:07.940
Listen, you take this. I'm not hungry.

05:13.379 --> 05:16.783
Mom's barely out the door
and the sharks are already circling.

05:17.417 --> 05:20.520
Those old church widows
are worse than sharks.

05:20.586 --> 05:22.822
They circle before the blood
even hits the water.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.658
Maybe it'll all blow over
in another day or so.

05:26.192 --> 05:28.194
You think he'll take her back
just like that?

05:28.261 --> 05:29.562
Well, you see how lost he is.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.965
Yeah, well,
Grandma seems pretty lonely, too.

05:33.032 --> 05:36.235
It can't go on
much longer like this. Trust me.

05:36.302 --> 05:40.173
Well, in the meantime, there's no need
for this food to go to waste.

05:40.239 --> 05:41.841
You're not gonna eat it, are you?

05:41.908 --> 05:43.643
I am. I'ma dig right in.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.244
Well...

05:48.047 --> 05:49.182
Damn.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.317
It's better than Grandma's.

05:53.119 --> 05:55.421
I do not envy you, Mary Jane.

05:55.488 --> 05:58.424
How do you choose between
your best friend and your boyfriend?

05:58.491 --> 06:01.594
You say "boyfriend"
like she's deciding who to take to prom.

06:01.661 --> 06:04.297
Justin is her "man," her "ride or die."

06:04.363 --> 06:07.800
Kara's been riding or dying
for Mary Jane way longer than Justin.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.870
But your man takes precedence
over your friends.

06:10.937 --> 06:13.973
If she overlooks
Kara's talent and loyalty

06:14.040 --> 06:16.275
in favor of Justin,
she won't have her as a friend.

06:16.342 --> 06:18.244
Well, that's a bit of a stretch.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.281
Unless you know something I don't.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.919
Okay, you did not hear this from me,

06:26.986 --> 06:29.388
but Kara took a meeting with Ronda
about her talk show.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.290
Whoa, no, bullshit, bullshit!

06:33.593 --> 06:36.462
Even if she took the meeting,
she would never take the job.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.264
Then why didn't she tell you?

06:43.369 --> 06:45.037
I'd better roll another one.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.777
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:50.843 --> 06:52.745
Were you at work the whole time?

06:52.812 --> 06:54.080
I had drinks with Aaron.

06:55.915 --> 06:56.849
Yeah.

06:57.817 --> 07:00.319
He wants me to be Garrett's replacement.

07:01.487 --> 07:04.957
No, he hates the fact that it's you
and Kara the only ones in the running.

07:05.024 --> 07:06.259
He did.

07:06.325 --> 07:08.261
But he knows
one of us is gonna get the job,

07:08.327 --> 07:09.662
and he'd rather it be me.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.064
You struck a deal with him.

07:12.131 --> 07:14.267
We came to an understanding.

07:15.401 --> 07:16.969
So, you have Aaron's vote.

07:17.036 --> 07:20.540
And that Prince Harry interview

07:20.606 --> 07:22.909
is the feather I needed
to win over Sawyer.

07:24.577 --> 07:25.845
What if you don't win?

07:26.879 --> 07:29.081
For the sake of supposing,

07:29.515 --> 07:32.718
what if Kara did get the job?
What would your reaction be?

07:34.620 --> 07:36.155
Well...

07:36.222 --> 07:38.658
In light of the uncertainty at GDU,

07:38.724 --> 07:42.662
I put out a couple of discreet feelers
about job opportunities,

07:42.728 --> 07:44.430
as any smart person would have.

07:44.497 --> 07:47.333
But I'm just hedging my bets.
I wanna stay at GDU.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.168
Of course.

07:50.069 --> 07:53.239
But you would take another job,
if you weren't promoted.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.308
Hey, we don't need to worry about that.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.744
Aaron and Sawyer aren't the only ones
on the hiring committee.

07:58.811 --> 07:59.779
Okay.

08:00.713 --> 08:03.816
Garrett and the head of the department,
they'd vote for Kara.

08:04.550 --> 08:07.186
So that's a tie.
Two for Kara, two for you.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.655
And it's all gonna come down to one vote.

08:10.489 --> 08:12.859
Now, if it wasn't between me and Kara,

08:12.925 --> 08:14.560
they would allow you to weigh in.

08:15.761 --> 08:17.964
But I think
they're gonna give Felix a say.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.732
The head of operations?

08:21.033 --> 08:24.437
And if I'm right,
and he has the deciding vote,

08:25.705 --> 08:27.106
Garrett's job is mine.

08:51.397 --> 08:52.999
<i>Look, everyone makes mistakes,</i>

08:53.399 --> 08:55.334
<i>and Hollins recognizes
that the interview</i>

08:55.401 --> 08:58.237
<i>where she appeared
to sympathize with Marci Livingston</i>

08:58.304 --> 09:00.006
<i>for employing
and housing Syrian...</i>

09:00.072 --> 09:02.675
I can't believe she took
your advice and kissed the ring.

09:02.742 --> 09:05.878
She finally expresses
a compassionate opinion

09:05.945 --> 09:08.714
and she's gotta backtrack
for fear of being attacked in the street.

09:08.781 --> 09:09.882
Seriously?

09:09.949 --> 09:14.620
But, listen, we have to solidify
this angle on the Mary Jane piece

09:14.687 --> 09:17.223
and we have to do it
before the story meeting, so...

09:17.290 --> 09:19.258
Okay, what about men?

09:19.325 --> 09:21.227
Wait, no,
let's not make this about them.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.528
Yeah.

09:22.595 --> 09:23.896
How about...

09:25.965 --> 09:28.434
"A Black Woman's Guide to the Universe"?

09:30.002 --> 09:32.972
I like the title,
but we wanna include all women, right?

09:33.039 --> 09:34.340
That's true. What about...

09:34.407 --> 09:38.210
"Women, Your Checklist
Needs a 21st Century Update."

09:38.277 --> 09:39.745
I think that's the one.

09:39.812 --> 09:42.348
And do you know what?
I've reached out to a few panelists.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.116
So, if everything goes well,

09:44.183 --> 09:47.887
I think I have a real fighting chance
against Justin and the prince.

09:47.954 --> 09:51.290
I know, I'm sorry. I know your name
is Bennett and you ain't in it,

09:51.357 --> 09:53.626
but can I just tell you one little thing?

09:53.693 --> 09:57.263
I don't wanna jinx it,
but if I get this executive producer job,

09:57.330 --> 09:59.899
I'm moving John
and the kids to New York.

10:02.234 --> 10:04.170
John agreed to that? He hates New York.

10:04.236 --> 10:05.771
He sees how hard I've been working

10:05.838 --> 10:09.108
and how much I've been sacrificing
with the boys, and he said yes.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.644
I'm so excited,
but I'm getting ahead of myself.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.312
I have to go and meet Orlando

10:13.379 --> 10:15.514
to go over the details
for his retirement party.

10:15.581 --> 10:17.583
- You're still coming?
- I wouldn't miss it.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.685
Okay, great. See you later.

10:25.224 --> 10:27.793
Okay, well, the menu's taken care of.

10:27.860 --> 10:30.896
You know, they tried to serve us
finger foods and I was like, no.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.898
This is a Latin event.
We want the real grub.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.235
And your mother's making your favorite,
since she can't be here, so...

10:37.470 --> 10:39.572
- Orlando?
- Yeah.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.507
<i>What's the matter, papi?</i>

10:42.308 --> 10:44.343
Hey, do you wanna postpone this

10:44.410 --> 10:46.612
until your mother gets back
from your sister's?

10:46.679 --> 10:48.481
No, my mom's not the problem. I...

10:48.547 --> 10:51.450
So, what's the matter?
Are you nervous about your announcement?

10:51.517 --> 10:52.518
No...

10:53.686 --> 10:55.721
I'm meeting Connie tomorrow.

10:55.788 --> 10:57.823
The co-host of the new show?

10:57.890 --> 11:00.526
And word is she doesn't have
a very high opinion of me.

11:01.694 --> 11:04.096
- That's just stupid gossip.
- No, my agent told me.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.831
She thinks I'm just another dumb jock.

11:07.066 --> 11:08.467
Well, she's probably right.

11:08.534 --> 11:11.003
- Okay, stop.
- What am I thinking?

11:11.070 --> 11:14.740
Orlando, this is just nervous talk, okay?

11:14.807 --> 11:17.810
Listen, why don't you invite her
to the retirement party?

11:17.877 --> 11:20.212
You'll be surrounded
by everybody who loves you.

11:20.279 --> 11:22.681
It'll be a great way for you
to break the ice with Connie

11:22.748 --> 11:24.316
in a very comfortable environment.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.320
- You really think that'll work?
- I know it'll work.

11:28.387 --> 11:31.957
There's no way she's gonna walk out
of this bar thinking you're a dumb jock.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.293
Silly.

11:35.494 --> 11:36.495
Hey.

11:37.763 --> 11:38.798
Thank you.

11:40.266 --> 11:44.003
And the panel will feature a host
of feminists, bloggers, journalists,

11:44.070 --> 11:46.138
all with huge social media following,

11:46.205 --> 11:47.773
so, we can make this a real event.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.309
We're not really gonna
move forward with this, are we?

11:50.376 --> 11:51.444
What don't you like?

11:51.510 --> 11:54.380
Sorry, ladies, but this is GDU,
not an episode of "Sex In the City."

11:54.847 --> 11:57.850
Our ratings just recovered.
It seems too soon to take such a risk.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.685
These are important issues, Aaron.

11:59.752 --> 12:02.788
No, but Aaron does have a point.
This isn't "The View."

12:02.855 --> 12:04.924
I'm sorry,
aren't we forgetting something?

12:05.524 --> 12:07.827
Most of our viewers are women.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.929
Mary Jane is exactly right.

12:09.995 --> 12:13.866
Look, it makes perfect sense
to appeal to that audience directly

12:13.933 --> 12:16.001
by featuring interesting discussions

12:16.068 --> 12:18.871
of stories and issues
that are important to women.

12:18.938 --> 12:21.373
You don't agree
with Aaron that it's too risky?

12:21.440 --> 12:23.909
Aaron, look, with all due respect,

12:23.976 --> 12:26.412
we're talking
about one segment here, right?

12:26.479 --> 12:27.913
If it doesn't work,

12:27.980 --> 12:30.216
the effect will be minimal,
if anything at all.

12:30.282 --> 12:33.452
If it does connect,
it could be a ratings boon for all of us.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.020
- If it does...
- Okay, I'm in.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.522
Let's try the segment.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.390
- But, Kara, Mary Jane.
- Yeah.

12:38.457 --> 12:42.027
I want you to focus
on packaging this piece

12:42.094 --> 12:44.864
to appeal to the widest
demographic, okay?

12:44.930 --> 12:47.466
Let's see how ready and willing

12:47.533 --> 12:50.269
our viewers are to dive into the issues.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.605
- Thank you, Garrett.
- Don't thank me.

12:52.671 --> 12:54.039
Thank Justin,

12:54.106 --> 12:57.143
whose sound and rational argument

12:57.209 --> 13:00.379
exhibited the kind of leadership skills
that GDU needs more of.

13:06.318 --> 13:07.720
Good afternoon, Paul.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.321
Don't you look handsome?

13:09.388 --> 13:12.491
- What a surprise, Constance.
- I brought you some fried chicken.

13:15.027 --> 13:17.329
And my sweet potato pie.

13:17.396 --> 13:18.964
Why, thank you so much, Constance.

13:19.031 --> 13:20.499
Any time.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.642
We're gonna have
to start freezing these, Dad.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.811
How do we generate so much laundry?

13:32.878 --> 13:34.580
Grandma made it look easy.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.716
Grandpa, are you gonna eat
some of this food?

13:38.517 --> 13:40.619
No, I'm not interested.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.622
Come on, there has to be something here
that you like.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.090
I'm really not hungry.

13:51.931 --> 13:56.168
That passionate defense in there,
very uncharacteristic of Mr. Talbot.

13:56.235 --> 13:59.905
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Underneath all of that sexy ambition,

13:59.972 --> 14:01.407
Justin's a good guy.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.809
Justin knows
that Aaron's on the hiring committee,

14:03.876 --> 14:06.011
so, why is he sticking up for me?

14:06.078 --> 14:09.315
Maybe he's trying to get
on the good side of his new boss, you.

14:09.381 --> 14:12.218
We both know that he's not
giving up the fight that easily.

14:12.284 --> 14:14.486
I know him.
He's working some kind of angle.

14:22.494 --> 14:23.495
Hey.

14:24.630 --> 14:25.898
Hey.

14:26.565 --> 14:29.702
I didn't get a chance to thank you
for what you did in the story meeting.

14:29.768 --> 14:31.003
It's not necessary.

14:32.137 --> 14:34.907
I know deep down you probably agree
with Aaron's objections.

14:34.974 --> 14:36.875
I think he raised a valid point.

14:36.942 --> 14:39.378
But I also know what you're capable of.

14:39.445 --> 14:42.548
This segment, in your skilled hands,
can be spun into gold.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.085
So, look, here's the dossier
with all the subjects

14:46.151 --> 14:49.021
we need to cover for the Prince Harry
interview. Take a look at it.

14:49.088 --> 14:52.358
And we'll get into the specifics later.
I'm gonna see you tonight, right?

14:52.424 --> 14:54.426
I thought Garrett's poker game
was tonight.

14:54.493 --> 14:58.364
Yeah, look, there's really no upside
to me going to that.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.799
You know?
And if I lose, I'm gonna look bad.

15:00.866 --> 15:03.035
If I win and take their money,
I'll look bad,

15:03.102 --> 15:06.305
and odds are Garrett will skip it, too,
for the very same reasons.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.173
You are probably right.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.742
It's a crucial time, you know?

15:09.808 --> 15:12.845
I've just gotta play
everything right, right now.

15:12.911 --> 15:16.382
You're really fighting hard for this job.

15:16.448 --> 15:18.150
I'm fighting hard for us.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.786
Look, I didn't wanna say anything,

15:20.853 --> 15:23.789
but when I was putting out
feelers for work,

15:23.856 --> 15:24.990
I was offered a job.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.160
In LA, to executive produce

15:28.227 --> 15:30.863
a new political talk show for VICE.

15:32.564 --> 15:35.134
Wow, congratulations, that...

15:35.200 --> 15:36.635
That is...

15:37.202 --> 15:40.039
- A great offer.
- Thank you. It is.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.708
But the last thing I wanna do
is put us in a position

15:42.775 --> 15:45.444
where I have to consider
taking this job and moving.

15:46.745 --> 15:48.480
But if Kara wins, I...

15:50.349 --> 15:51.850
I don't know if I'll have a choice.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.887
Couldn't you just stay
in your current position?

15:54.953 --> 15:57.756
You'd still be senior producer
and at least we'd...

15:58.891 --> 16:00.025
be together.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.328
Do you really think
Kara's gonna want me around?

16:02.394 --> 16:04.229
God, that's water under the bridge.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.065
I'm glad you think so.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.499
Look, nothing is certain.

16:07.566 --> 16:10.002
I have to do everything
in my power to make sure

16:10.069 --> 16:12.771
that I am the number one choice, okay?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.708
All right, I'll see you later.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.378
Get back to work.

16:28.454 --> 16:31.423
I just wanna say that I am very proud

16:31.490 --> 16:33.459
of the hard work that we've all done here

16:33.525 --> 16:35.894
at "Great Day USA"
in the past five years.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.700
And I'm even prouder because tonight

16:41.767 --> 16:43.335
we are nominated

16:43.402 --> 16:45.938
for more awards than any other show.

16:46.004 --> 16:47.906
And this wouldn't have happened

16:47.973 --> 16:49.808
without you at the helm.

16:52.111 --> 16:55.948
So, let's all raise our glasses
to "Great Day USA."

16:56.014 --> 16:57.616
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

16:59.618 --> 17:01.820
Yes, we did it.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.223
We did it!

17:15.234 --> 17:17.302
Are you sure
you don't wanna come by my place?

17:17.369 --> 17:20.839
I can't, girl.
Orlando promised me a hot oil massage.

17:20.906 --> 17:24.510
- He took classes and everything.
- All right, I'll see you at the studio.

17:24.576 --> 17:26.745
Yeah. Hey, congratulations, Mary Jane.

17:32.618 --> 17:33.852
Hey, come on, buddy.

17:36.188 --> 17:39.825
It's good? Yeah, guess so. Let's go.

17:46.298 --> 17:47.933
Must be some dream you're having.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.670
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

17:53.605 --> 17:54.973
Were you working?

17:55.040 --> 17:56.408
No. Take a look.

17:59.011 --> 18:01.613
That's the view
from the condo on Necker Island.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.816
What condo on Necker Island?

18:03.882 --> 18:05.984
Our condo on Necker Island.

18:07.152 --> 18:08.220
Shut up!

18:08.287 --> 18:09.455
I just bought it.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.724
And as soon as I get Garrett's job,

18:12.791 --> 18:14.993
we can schedule our first trip.

18:15.060 --> 18:17.162
Wait, wait a second, wait a second.

18:17.229 --> 18:21.133
When I mentioned this before,
you balked at the 5-figure rental price,

18:21.200 --> 18:23.836
but now you've plunked down
seven figures to buy the place?

18:23.902 --> 18:27.072
What happened? Did Tiffany
have something to do with this?

18:28.774 --> 18:31.143
You and Tiffany are both very persuasive.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.180
Simone wanted me to be happy.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.684
Seeing you smile does that.

18:42.254 --> 18:44.323
See?

18:54.533 --> 18:55.601
So...

18:55.667 --> 18:57.436
How bad would it be if I chose Justin?

18:57.503 --> 18:59.004
It would be so good.

18:59.505 --> 19:00.772
Mary Jane.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.641
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

19:02.708 --> 19:03.709
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

19:09.114 --> 19:10.682
These trolls turn on you

19:10.749 --> 19:13.352
the minute you voice an opinion
that differs from theirs.

19:13.418 --> 19:16.355
If I have to constantly
backtrack my reporting

19:16.421 --> 19:19.224
because my constituents don't agree,
then it's not worth it.

19:19.758 --> 19:22.361
I mean, I'd rather have credibility
than my followers.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.163
You are sounding less like a blogger

19:25.230 --> 19:27.466
and more
like a real journalist every day.

19:27.533 --> 19:29.334
Why, thank you.

19:29.401 --> 19:30.435
I think.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.572
You should join the women's panel.
We can show the viewers

19:33.639 --> 19:36.041
that even though we have
opposing political views,

19:36.108 --> 19:38.210
we're both women
with a ton of common ground.

19:38.277 --> 19:41.213
That would be so cool.
Really, thank you. I appreciate that.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.315
- No problem.
- Yeah.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.552
I meant to ask.

19:47.119 --> 19:50.155
Is it true? Do you have the deciding vote
on Garrett's replacement?

19:51.623 --> 19:53.725
No. What...

19:53.792 --> 19:55.661
What would make you think that?

19:55.727 --> 19:58.730
I just thought I heard
Justin and Aaron talking about it.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.132
Probably heard wrong.

20:00.198 --> 20:02.000
It's a good thing it's not true, though.

20:02.067 --> 20:05.237
Wouldn't it be awful having to choose
between your man and your bestie?

20:05.304 --> 20:06.838
Yeah. Right.

20:11.009 --> 20:14.713
<i>So, ladies, tell me,
why are women still pining</i>

20:14.780 --> 20:16.548
<i>for marriage and family</i>

20:16.615 --> 20:18.250
<i>when the game has clearly changed?</i>

20:18.317 --> 20:20.852
<i>You're right.
The institution isn't what it used to be.</i>

20:20.919 --> 20:23.855
Marriage rates have been
on a steady decline since the '80s.

20:23.922 --> 20:26.091
Well, we might be doing ourselves
a disservice

20:26.158 --> 20:28.660
by comparing 21st century marriage rates

20:28.727 --> 20:30.329
to those of decades past.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.864
I think that we have to ask ourselves

20:32.931 --> 20:35.300
why are marriage rates
on the decline, anyway?

20:35.367 --> 20:38.637
I think it's because
the men simply aren't out there.

20:38.704 --> 20:41.106
I mean, black women
know a lot about that.

20:41.173 --> 20:42.574
When it comes to start a family,

20:42.641 --> 20:44.876
we stopped waiting on men
a long time ago.

20:44.943 --> 20:46.979
Because the jobs aren't there, right?

20:47.045 --> 20:50.182
A lack of economic stability
means fewer suitable partners

20:50.248 --> 20:51.850
for women of all stripes.

20:51.917 --> 20:55.787
When faced with limited
employment options and depressed wages,

20:55.854 --> 20:58.857
it's no wonder that some men
forgo starting families.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.093
It's also understandable that some women

21:01.159 --> 21:03.061
choose to start families on their own.

21:03.128 --> 21:06.231
Well, look at Shonda Rhimes.
She's single and has three kids.

21:06.298 --> 21:07.933
And more power to her.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.102
But I'm not raising
no kids without a man.

21:10.168 --> 21:12.938
I need to have
"wait until your daddy gets home"

21:13.005 --> 21:14.206
in my back pocket.

21:14.272 --> 21:17.709
Exactly. But why is it
that it all falls on the woman

21:17.776 --> 21:21.647
<i>to try to fight to make those dreams
a reality all on her own?</i>

21:21.713 --> 21:24.016
<i>Why aren't men fighting
for families as well?</i>

21:24.082 --> 21:25.150
<i>Who says men aren't?</i>

21:25.217 --> 21:26.852
<i>There's so much they can do</i>

21:26.918 --> 21:29.855
without good government policies
supporting families...

21:29.921 --> 21:32.190
health care, jobs, education.

21:32.257 --> 21:33.859
Or take paid family leave.

21:33.925 --> 21:36.228
Among the lowest wages workers,

21:36.294 --> 21:40.065
women of all races and men of color,
97 percent of them

21:40.132 --> 21:41.767
don't have paid family leave.

21:41.833 --> 21:44.770
Hold Dani, we need to hear
what the white girl has to say.

21:44.836 --> 21:47.506
<i>Dani, as a woman from middle America,</i>

21:47.572 --> 21:50.308
<i>do you agree
that society is the problem?</i>

21:50.375 --> 21:53.545
<i>Absolutely not.
These men have to take responsibility.</i>

21:53.612 --> 21:57.449
But what if the years go by
and he still hasn't shown up?

21:57.516 --> 22:00.218
- What then?
- Be like Shonda. Do it yourself.

22:00.285 --> 22:04.956
But, I mean, look, I have been thirsty
for a man my whole life, right?

22:05.023 --> 22:07.959
<i>But some of us have a hard time
getting to that point.</i>

22:08.393 --> 22:10.362
Well, because we bought into the notion

22:10.429 --> 22:12.664
that without a man,
we'll live a life of doom.

22:12.731 --> 22:14.766
That's what society teaches us, right?

22:14.833 --> 22:17.169
That if you dare
have a child without a man,

22:17.235 --> 22:20.105
that child is gonna be prone
to all sorts of societal ills,

22:20.172 --> 22:22.307
from poverty, to drugs, to alcoholism,

22:22.374 --> 22:24.543
all because a man isn't present.

22:24.609 --> 22:25.911
But I'm realizing...

22:26.344 --> 22:29.181
I think I might be enough.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.884
<i>If we lived in a society
that actually supported</i>

22:32.951 --> 22:34.319
<i>women and children,</i>

22:34.386 --> 22:36.488
I would be enough

22:36.555 --> 22:39.157
to be sole parent
and provider for a family.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.193
Does Justin know about this?

22:41.259 --> 22:43.528
'Cause you sound
like you wanna be single.

22:45.831 --> 22:48.066
The finer point
that I was trying to make

22:48.133 --> 22:51.770
is that if women can build
empires in our careers,

22:52.738 --> 22:55.540
why can't we build
families without husbands?

22:56.575 --> 23:00.412
Without men, perhaps, women are enough.

23:00.479 --> 23:01.913
<i>I still want one, though.</i>

23:02.881 --> 23:03.982
<i>Sorry.</i>

23:09.855 --> 23:12.491
I didn't mean to imply
that I think you're obsolete.

23:12.557 --> 23:13.925
No, I didn't take it that way.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.727
No?

23:16.561 --> 23:19.164
It didn't bother you, like, at all?

23:19.965 --> 23:21.900
Not even when Dani
referenced you on air?

23:21.967 --> 23:25.237
Even after we both agreed
there'd be no more public displays?

23:25.303 --> 23:27.372
I really thought you'd be furious.

23:27.439 --> 23:30.208
That segment allowed you
to connect with viewers

23:30.275 --> 23:33.111
in a way I've never seen before, right?

23:33.178 --> 23:34.679
That's a good thing.

23:35.380 --> 23:37.149
That's why America loves you.

23:37.215 --> 23:38.450
It's why I love you.

23:39.618 --> 23:40.819
What did you just say?

23:42.354 --> 23:44.089
Okay, you want me to repeat it?

23:48.426 --> 23:50.195
How long have you known?

23:50.762 --> 23:51.797
Known what?

23:52.430 --> 23:54.566
It's obvious you know
they're giving me a vote.

23:54.633 --> 23:56.101
So, how long have you known?

23:57.803 --> 24:01.873
Wait, you... for Garrett's replacement,
you have the vote?

24:02.674 --> 24:04.176
You've said all the right things.

24:04.242 --> 24:06.378
You've done
all kinds of out of character shit.

24:06.444 --> 24:07.479
Come on, Justin.

24:07.546 --> 24:10.015
- How long have you known?
- It's the first time I hear it.

24:10.081 --> 24:11.516
Stop. I know Aaron has told you.

24:11.583 --> 24:13.118
Aaron didn't tell me shit.

24:13.985 --> 24:15.821
So, let me get this straight. You...

24:16.288 --> 24:19.357
You've been keeping this information
a secret from me this whole time

24:19.424 --> 24:21.927
and you're accusing me
of being duplicitous.

24:21.993 --> 24:23.228
You're serious?

24:25.730 --> 24:27.332
- You didn't know?
- I didn't know.

24:27.399 --> 24:28.967
If you don't believe me, ask Aaron.

24:29.034 --> 24:30.468
I didn't know. I had no idea.

24:30.535 --> 24:33.205
But now I'm curious.
Let me get this straight.

24:33.271 --> 24:36.041
So, my girl, when was she gonna tell me

24:36.875 --> 24:39.177
that she had the deciding vote
for my promotion?

24:44.449 --> 24:45.951
Yeah, well, now you're quiet.

24:46.017 --> 24:47.352
That makes sense. Yeah.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.454
You had a lot of shit to say before.

24:49.521 --> 24:51.423
- I'm sorry, Justin.
- You know what?

24:51.489 --> 24:54.125
- Okay? I'm sorry.
- You shouldn't be the one that's sorry.

24:54.526 --> 24:55.760
I am.

24:56.361 --> 24:57.629
I really am.

24:57.696 --> 24:59.097
You don't trust me.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.265
Still.

25:01.633 --> 25:03.301
After all the work I've done.

25:04.269 --> 25:06.271
You wanted the anchor chair.
I gave it to you.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.708
You thought I got Kara fired.
I got Kara her job back.

25:10.275 --> 25:12.377
You wanted Prince Harry.
I gave him to you.

25:12.444 --> 25:15.580
You wanted Necker Island.
I gave it to you.

25:15.647 --> 25:17.849
You wanted to do your special.
I helped to save it.

25:17.916 --> 25:21.887
I do all these things to show you
how I feel, that I believe in you.

25:21.953 --> 25:23.221
But you, you...

25:23.622 --> 25:25.490
use it as more reason to doubt me.

25:25.557 --> 25:27.158
Maybe that's a pitfall

25:27.225 --> 25:29.728
of having a relationship
that started the way ours did.

25:32.330 --> 25:37.269
Maybe, Justin,
there will always be a sliver of doubt.

25:37.335 --> 25:38.870
And what does that mean, exactly?

25:41.339 --> 25:42.440
Did you choose Kara?

25:54.619 --> 25:56.488
Baby, we are this close...

25:57.422 --> 26:01.526
this close to realizing our dreams,
everything that we talked about.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.295
Do you love me?

26:04.229 --> 26:05.430
I do love you.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.636
If you look at what I've done...

26:13.872 --> 26:16.341
you'll know that everything
I'm saying is true.

26:25.383 --> 26:28.887
Yeah, the hiring committee
is waiting for us upstairs,

26:28.954 --> 26:31.790
so, have you made your decision yet?

26:33.658 --> 26:35.760
After much consideration...

26:36.528 --> 26:37.762
I have.

26:40.565 --> 26:44.936
Thank you. Thank you, everyone,
for a great show this morning.

26:45.003 --> 26:48.340
As all of you know,
today is my last day as EP.

26:48.406 --> 26:51.176
I can't tell you how much
I've enjoyed my time here.

26:51.710 --> 26:57.415
Your hard work and dedication
to this show has been most appreciated.

26:58.183 --> 27:01.953
Now, there's just one final
bit of housekeeping.

27:02.020 --> 27:05.290
A decision has been made
on my replacement.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.492
And I am thrilled to announce

27:07.559 --> 27:11.296
that GDU's new Executive Producer
will be...

27:12.597 --> 27:14.199
Kara Lynch.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.335
Congratulations, Kara.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.675
Mary Jane!

27:34.686 --> 27:36.755
Thank you so much, everyone.

27:37.722 --> 27:38.890
Justin!

27:51.136 --> 27:52.103
Why?

27:54.939 --> 27:57.842
After everything we talked about. Why?

28:00.078 --> 28:04.582
You and Kara are both more than qualified
to run this show.

28:05.383 --> 28:08.486
I mean, look at what you've each done
just this week alone.

28:08.553 --> 28:12.090
- She revived my panel on women.
- You're not answering my question.

28:12.157 --> 28:14.426
Kara will take this show
to new heights, Justin.

28:15.894 --> 28:16.995
I know it.

28:17.062 --> 28:20.832
And I think that I was afraid
that if I picked you...

28:22.967 --> 28:24.602
I would just be doing it out of fear.

28:26.271 --> 28:27.372
Fear?

28:27.439 --> 28:30.041
Fear that if I didn't choose you,
then that would...

28:33.378 --> 28:35.280
That would mean
the end of our relationship.

28:35.880 --> 28:41.119
But if our relationship is really meant
to stand the test of time, then...

28:41.953 --> 28:43.688
it'll withstand this.

28:44.456 --> 28:45.423
Right?

28:50.829 --> 28:52.263
Where are you going?

28:54.299 --> 28:55.867
You made your decision.

28:57.569 --> 29:00.071
Now I'm gonna live up
to your expectations.

29:27.031 --> 29:28.032
Grandma?

29:28.700 --> 29:31.236
Niecy. Don't sneak up on me like that.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.239
Don't worry.
Dad and Grandpa are out playing golf.

29:34.305 --> 29:36.407
They won't be back for a couple of hours.

29:36.474 --> 29:38.810
Well, I'm glad he and Paul made up.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.211
He'll come around to you, too.

29:41.846 --> 29:43.581
In their own time, right?

29:44.382 --> 29:47.952
Now, Niecy, I don't think Grandpa
has taken his medicine.

29:48.019 --> 29:50.121
No, I've been making sure
he stays on top of it.

29:50.188 --> 29:51.990
You've been refilling it?

29:52.056 --> 29:55.126
Wow, you've been stepping up
around here, Miss Niecy.

29:56.694 --> 29:58.163
I'll get it. Be right back.

29:59.330 --> 30:00.498
I'll answer the door.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.767
Marguerite?

30:02.834 --> 30:04.402
Helen?

30:04.469 --> 30:06.704
I was just being neighborly

30:06.771 --> 30:08.873
bringing Paul and the kids
my caramel cake.

30:09.507 --> 30:11.609
Everyone's heard about your troubles.

30:11.676 --> 30:13.478
I just wanted to do my part to help.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.247
You are barking up the wrong tree.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.882
Paul and I are still married,

30:17.949 --> 30:20.752
and I would appreciate it
if you would just keep your distance.

30:20.818 --> 30:24.055
And you can keep that little
dried-up looking cake, too.

30:25.523 --> 30:27.058
The nerve!

30:27.125 --> 30:28.660
And wearing a church hat!

30:28.726 --> 30:31.629
Don't worry, Grandpa hasn't touched
any of those dishes.

30:31.696 --> 30:33.331
Dishes? You mean there's more?

30:33.398 --> 30:34.699
Hell, no!

30:37.368 --> 30:41.206
Those damn thirsty bitches
better lay off my man!

30:42.207 --> 30:44.275
All this mediocre mess.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.411
I'll give him something he can't refuse.

30:51.015 --> 30:55.019
Grandma, those old biddies
don't got nothing on you.

30:57.922 --> 30:59.724
Now, you wanna tell me what's wrong?

30:59.791 --> 31:02.093
What do you mean?
I'm getting ready for the party.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.162
Kara, your hands are shaking.

31:07.565 --> 31:10.301
I think Orlando is planning
on proposing tonight.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.436
- What?
- Yes.

31:11.502 --> 31:13.805
- What makes you think that?
- Because, look...

31:16.941 --> 31:19.644
Yeah, I found it in his bag
when I was doing laundry.

31:20.511 --> 31:23.615
- And you took a photo of it?
- Yes! I learned from the best.

31:24.549 --> 31:25.683
Isn't it beautiful?

31:25.750 --> 31:26.784
My God...

31:26.851 --> 31:28.820
So, why aren't you more excited?

31:31.022 --> 31:34.192
Honestly, ever since
my divorce from John,

31:34.259 --> 31:36.761
I've just been so laser-focused
on my career,

31:36.828 --> 31:40.064
I never considered the possibility
of getting married again.

31:40.131 --> 31:43.268
I thought I was done with that,
especially with a guy like Orlando.

31:43.334 --> 31:44.836
I mean, he's so young.

31:44.902 --> 31:47.472
Younger guys are not supposed
to want to put the ring on it.

31:47.538 --> 31:49.774
Yes, when they recognize
they have a good woman

31:49.841 --> 31:51.175
and they don't wanna lose her.

31:51.676 --> 31:53.678
I don't know, I just... I feel like

31:53.745 --> 31:57.649
I'm on the precipice of getting
everything I want right now.

31:57.715 --> 31:59.784
You know, my dream job...

31:59.851 --> 32:02.854
finding a man that I never thought
I'd find, you know?

32:02.920 --> 32:03.955
I just...

32:05.490 --> 32:09.894
I don't know, something deep down
inside of me is not letting me trust it.

32:09.961 --> 32:11.629
- Which part?
- Any of it.

32:13.064 --> 32:14.465
You wanna marry him, right?

32:15.800 --> 32:16.868
Yeah.

32:16.934 --> 32:19.437
So, listen to me.
Good things are happening to you

32:20.104 --> 32:21.439
because you deserve it.

32:22.373 --> 32:23.908
So, embrace it and rejoice,

32:23.975 --> 32:26.144
because, honey,
this is just the beginning.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.948
- Thanks, mama.
- Now come here.

32:32.684 --> 32:35.253
- Let me...
- What are you doing?

32:35.320 --> 32:38.189
I'm oiling up the ring finger,
so the rock slides on.

32:41.492 --> 32:44.162
I feel like I'm being insensitive
towards you.

32:46.097 --> 32:49.100
Listen, you don't have to come
to this thing tonight.

32:49.167 --> 32:51.402
Life doesn't stop
just because Justin left.

32:53.271 --> 32:54.972
I wanna be there for you.

32:55.039 --> 32:57.642
I know and I appreciate that,
I really do.

32:57.709 --> 33:00.244
But letting you off the hook for tonight

33:00.311 --> 33:03.147
is me being there for you.

33:12.757 --> 33:13.991
Kara.

33:14.058 --> 33:15.593
- Hey.
- Hi!

33:15.660 --> 33:16.794
<i>-¡Mi Amor!
-¡Papi!</i>

33:16.861 --> 33:18.796
The party can finally get started.

33:19.530 --> 33:22.233
Congratulations, baby.
I'm so proud of you.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.035
You look gorgeous.

33:24.569 --> 33:25.603
Thank you.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.572
- Hello.
- Connie.

33:27.638 --> 33:28.973
This is my girlfriend, Kara.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.275
Kara, this is my new co-host, Connie.

33:31.342 --> 33:35.580
Kara, Orlando speaks very highly of you.

33:35.646 --> 33:37.782
And congratulations on the promotion.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.051
Thank you. It's very nice to meet you.

33:40.118 --> 33:42.653
Orlando's very excited
about the new show.

33:43.287 --> 33:47.825
Orlando, your cousin Marco
challenged me to a shots contest.

33:48.493 --> 33:50.161
I'm gonna drink him under the table.

33:50.695 --> 33:51.929
You have to come watch.

33:51.996 --> 33:54.932
- I'll be right there in a second.
- Okay. Nice to meet you.

33:54.999 --> 33:56.300
- Yeah.
- Bye.

33:58.536 --> 33:59.871
Marco.

33:59.937 --> 34:01.839
You two seem very familiar.

34:01.906 --> 34:04.475
Yeah, we had a drink before the party
and kind of hit it off.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.610
Really?

34:05.676 --> 34:07.845
Yeah, she's given me advice
about being an anchor.

34:08.346 --> 34:11.082
<i>You were right, mi amor,
I have nothing to worry about.</i>

34:13.551 --> 34:14.952
Gather around, people.

34:15.019 --> 34:18.556
I think it's time we hear
from the man of the hour himself.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.559
- Orlando!
- Orlando!

34:25.229 --> 34:26.764
Thank you all for coming.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.500
Before I make the announcement
public tomorrow,

34:29.567 --> 34:31.869
I wanted to celebrate my retirement

34:31.936 --> 34:35.506
with all the people who've made
my baseball career so memorable,

34:35.573 --> 34:38.576
especially my coaches, and my teammates.

34:38.643 --> 34:41.179
It's been an incredible journey.
I'll never forget you.

34:41.245 --> 34:44.816
But I also wanna say
something special to my Kara.

34:46.017 --> 34:49.153
Without her, I wouldn't be moving on
to the next phase of my career.

34:49.220 --> 34:52.056
You pushed me farther
than I ever thought I could go.

34:52.824 --> 34:55.026
Orlando, this night is about you, not me.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.861
This night is about us.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.897
Everyone, a round of applause
for this woman

34:59.964 --> 35:03.100
who is the first Latina
executive producer

35:03.167 --> 35:06.370
of the highest-rated morning show
in the country!

35:12.043 --> 35:13.177
Kara.

35:14.078 --> 35:16.681
I also have something
very special to give you

35:16.747 --> 35:18.216
to mark this occasion.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.825
I knew you were gonna get that job.
I had it made especially for you.

35:30.428 --> 35:32.897
- A name plate.
- Yeah.

35:34.232 --> 35:36.000
- Look at this.
- Yeah!

35:41.973 --> 35:43.241
Baby...

35:43.875 --> 35:46.244
- To Kara!
- To Kara!

35:47.078 --> 35:48.246
Cheers.

35:49.547 --> 35:51.315
Let's party, baby!

35:55.286 --> 35:57.622
<i>Mary Jane, what's going on?</i>

35:57.688 --> 35:59.590
<i>I haven't heard from you.</i>

35:59.657 --> 36:01.092
<i>I just wanted to check in.</i>

36:01.926 --> 36:04.595
<i>Please call me when you get this
and let me know you're okay.</i>

36:10.935 --> 36:12.670
I don't really know what I'm looking at.

36:13.204 --> 36:15.172
Those are the two embryos.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.942
They've developed nicely.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.810
Before the implantation procedure,

36:19.877 --> 36:22.513
I like to give the patient
an opportunity to see them.

36:24.282 --> 36:26.817
So, are you ready to proceed?

36:29.320 --> 36:30.821
More than ready.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.961
You know your cooking is hard to resist.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.664
Can I serve you another helping?

36:39.730 --> 36:42.233
Helen, if I have another bite,
I'm gonna burst.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.870
Well, I hope you saved a little for...

36:45.937 --> 36:47.238
your favorite.

36:48.272 --> 36:49.907
Red velvet cake.

36:51.576 --> 36:53.444
The kids say you have not been eating.

36:54.545 --> 36:57.114
If I'm away that much longer,
you're gonna just

36:57.615 --> 37:01.018
waste away to skin and bones.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.125
Paul.

37:08.826 --> 37:10.294
Can you forgive me?

37:12.430 --> 37:14.031
Can we

37:14.098 --> 37:16.367
put this behind us

37:16.434 --> 37:17.635
and move on?

37:19.570 --> 37:21.238
I wanna come home...

37:23.007 --> 37:24.642
where I belong.

37:26.544 --> 37:27.545
With you.

37:30.047 --> 37:31.349
Helen.

37:31.415 --> 37:33.584
You shouldn't have gone
through all this trouble.

37:34.118 --> 37:36.220
I'm grateful.

37:36.287 --> 37:38.756
I mean, there's no one who comes
close to your cooking.

37:38.823 --> 37:40.257
But I'm beginning to see

37:40.958 --> 37:43.894
how tough it's gonna be not having it.

37:46.530 --> 37:47.698
I have something.

37:55.139 --> 37:57.908
- What's this?
- I asked my attorney's advice

37:57.975 --> 38:00.244
how to best split up our marital assets.

38:01.379 --> 38:04.982
And I think you should take the time
to review this with your lawyer.

38:06.183 --> 38:09.453
Helen, I want you to know that I intend

38:09.520 --> 38:12.423
to make this transition
as easy as possible.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.660
For the entire family.

38:45.423 --> 38:48.793
I really wanted to make a grand gesture.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.930
I just couldn't decide
which ones, so I...

38:54.398 --> 38:55.433
I picked them all.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.835
I apologize...

38:58.436 --> 39:00.071
for walking out on you the other day.

39:00.137 --> 39:01.472
I know how your mind works,

39:01.539 --> 39:04.975
and it's probably racing
with a lot of crazy ideas.

39:05.042 --> 39:06.610
You would not be wrong about that.

39:06.677 --> 39:07.978
I'll be the first to admit

39:08.045 --> 39:10.214
that the loss of the promotion
was devastating.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.483
But when the dust settled,

39:12.550 --> 39:14.585
I realized it wasn't about the job.

39:14.652 --> 39:16.754
It wasn't about Kara.
It wasn't about any of that.

39:20.591 --> 39:23.127
I just don't wanna move forward
without you.

39:26.263 --> 39:29.934
Before, I wasn't one hundred percent
that I could separate

39:31.202 --> 39:33.504
Mary Jane the anchor
from Mary Jane the woman.

39:34.472 --> 39:36.507
- Justin...
- But now I can.

39:36.574 --> 39:40.478
And I wanna pitch a new dream...

39:42.680 --> 39:44.415
to replace that old one.

39:44.482 --> 39:46.150
You and me.

39:47.718 --> 39:48.919
The two of us.

39:48.986 --> 39:50.788
Let's grow old together.

39:53.791 --> 39:55.092
With our kids.

39:55.926 --> 39:57.328
Mary Jane...

40:00.097 --> 40:01.432
Will you marry me?
