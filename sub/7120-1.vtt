00:09.674 --> 00:10.908
Thanks for helping me record, Finn.

00:11.274 --> 00:12.346
No problem, Marceline.

00:12.590 --> 00:15.795
Now, I'm gonna sing something really
personal, so don't laugh at me.

00:16.210 --> 00:18.842
I would never dream of it...
m'lady. (Laughs)

00:19.680 --> 00:23.497
Now, start a slow beat, and keep it
steady, or it'll mess up
everything.

00:23.564 --> 00:24.483
You got it!

00:33.366 --> 00:36.823
Daddy, why did you eat my fries?

00:37.170 --> 00:41.114
I bought them, and they were mine.

00:41.477 --> 00:45.641
But you ate them, yeah, you ate my fries...

00:45.642 --> 00:49.614
And I cried, but you didn't see me cry.

00:50.599 --> 00:53.780
Daddy, Do you even love me?

00:54.007 --> 00:56.154
Well, I wish you'd show it,

00:56.301 --> 00:57.920
'Cause I wouldn't know it.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.524
What kind of dad eats his daughter's fries,

01:00.935 --> 01:02.809
And doesn't look her in the eyes?

01:03.322 --> 01:05.028
Daddy, there were tears there.

01:05.029 --> 01:07.518
If you saw them would you even care?

01:11.747 --> 01:14.706
Huh? Finn, you messed the beat up!

01:14.707 --> 01:16.673
Marceline, if you're
thinkin' about your dad

01:16.674 --> 01:18.638
so much, then... why
don't you go see 'im?

01:19.037 --> 01:20.125
He's not worth the effort.

01:20.541 --> 01:21.508
Not worth what effort?

01:21.908 --> 01:25.396
Well... first, I'd
have to draw a circle

01:25.397 --> 01:28.374
with a happy face
in the center..

01:27.985 --> 01:29.601
And then... uh... douse it with bug milk.

01:29.117 --> 01:30.117
Oh, yeah?!

01:32.155 --> 01:38.454
And then you're supposed to chant something
like, "Maloso
vobiscum et cum spiritum."

01:39.542 --> 01:42.085
But... I-I don't really wanna see him.

01:42.364 --> 01:44.816
I'm still mad about the
thing with the fries. Huh?!

01:45.299 --> 01:48.889
Wwwwhhhat?! Whoa... whoa!! Aaagh!!

01:50.585 --> 01:51.549
Marceline!

01:51.685 --> 01:53.626
Finn... what the heck did you do?!

01:54.001 --> 01:56.363
I... reunited you with your family?

01:58.243 --> 01:59.603
Is this kid your evil servant?

01:59.699 --> 02:02.834
I'm not evil, Marceline's dad. I'm super good!

02:03.255 --> 02:03.975
"Super good?"

02:06.533 --> 02:07.346
What're you doing?!

02:08.602 --> 02:10.121
Stealing your soul.

02:13.853 --> 02:17.041
Dad! Ugh! You always do stuff like this!

02:17.622 --> 02:19.590
Haha! Oh, Marceline!

02:19.590 --> 02:21.358
I never know what's gonna set you off!

02:21.782 --> 02:23.570
Whoa! Is this the family axe?

02:23.570 --> 02:24.251
Wha—? HEY!!!

02:24.757 --> 02:26.492
Did you turn it into some kind of lute?

02:26.892 --> 02:29.027
Give it back, and get out!!!

02:29.507 --> 02:30.753
Okay, I'll go.

02:30.924 --> 02:32.924
I've got business to attend to, anyway-

02:33.021 --> 02:35.406
—sucking up all the souls in Oooooo...

02:36.032 --> 02:37.027
WHA—Gh—NO!!

02:37.094 --> 02:38.243
See you kids later!

02:42.373 --> 02:42.955
My bass!

02:43.215 --> 02:44.801
I've unleashed evil onto Ooo!

02:44.960 --> 02:46.325
We've gotta stop 'im, Marceline!

02:46.646 --> 02:49.618
Fine... but I'm only coming with you to get my bass back.

02:51.481 --> 02:53.574
Hey! How do I kill this guy, anyway?

02:53.827 --> 02:55.846
Finn! You can't kill my dad!

02:56.453 --> 02:58.779
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean—

02:59.751 --> 03:03.436
No! You literally can't kill my dad! He's deathless!

03:03.843 --> 03:04.554
Oh...

03:08.384 --> 03:10.330
Huh? Who the fluff are you?

03:10.842 --> 03:14.312
Um... Well, I'm sure not the guy who's gonna suck out your soul.

03:14.593 --> 03:16.737
Good 'cause that's, like, my number one fear.

03:16.980 --> 03:22.062
Really!? Well... I know a little exercise for that! Wanna try?

03:22.340 --> 03:23.420
Wow...

03:23.649 --> 03:25.139
First... close your eyes.

03:14.399 --> 03:25.934
Okay!

03:26.220 --> 03:27.880
AAH! You coulda killed me!

03:28.150 --> 03:32.379
Ah, but I didn't! And now, aren't you thrilled just to be alive?

03:32.593 --> 03:34.119
Yeah, I guess... So what?

03:34.385 --> 03:38.209
So... This next part will be all the more... horrifying.

03:42.966 --> 03:45.841
There!! Below us! A gathering of Fluffy People!

03:46.162 --> 03:47.588
May-haps they've seen your father!

03:47.835 --> 03:50.318
Marceline... release the Finn-bomb!

03:56.021 --> 03:56.966
They're all freaked out!

03:57.148 --> 03:58.508
It's because they're scared of him.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.662
Hm. My dad's been here. Come on. Let's go.

04:05.722 --> 04:07.502
No! We gotta help this guy.

04:07.693 --> 04:10.326
I've got some soul food that Jake packed for me.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.221
You like, uh, collard greens or country-fried steak?

04:16.034 --> 04:19.457
Look. You wanna help him? Help me get my bass back.

04:19.595 --> 04:20.635
How will that help hi—?

04:20.656 --> 04:24.587
MY DAD STOLE MY BASS GUITAR, FINN!! And when I get it back...

04:24.662 --> 04:29.125
I'm gonna break it over his neck and slam my dad back into the Nightosphere!

04:31.372 --> 04:34.101
Oh, clam! But first you
gotta return the souls

04:34.101 --> 04:35.825
your dad sucked back to
these sad, little husks.

04:35.949 --> 04:36.838
Right, Marceline?

04:37.711 --> 04:39.686
Uh, sure, yeah, yeah, we'll do that.

04:40.165 --> 04:42.183
So I popped his head like a cork!

04:42.515 --> 04:46.409
And I says, "That's what I think of expanding Earth theory!"

04:51.654 --> 04:52.279
Alright.

04:52.410 --> 04:53.091
Huh?!

04:53.526 --> 04:54.625
I've got a joke, too.

04:56.222 --> 05:01.720
What wears a dark suit, is completely evil, and is about to suck out all your souls?

05:02.417 --> 05:02.880
Yo mama!

05:04.905 --> 05:06.986
That's right! I'm your mama!

05:12.495 --> 05:15.765
Red Rock Pass. If my dad wants to get through the mountains,

05:16.333 --> 05:17.742
he'll have to come through here.

05:17.873 --> 05:20.072
We can work together! And smash 'im with this rock!

05:20.373 --> 05:21.485
And once he's smooshed,

05:21.629 --> 05:23.791
all the souls will go back to their rightful bods.

05:35.699 --> 05:36.530
Huh?

05:41.093 --> 05:43.979
So, finally taking a run at your old man, huh?

05:46.699 --> 05:47.586
Daddy...

05:49.239 --> 05:49.989
Karate kick!!

05:51.408 --> 05:54.295
Marceline!! Keep 'im right there!! HrrrrRAAAAGH!!!

05:59.474 --> 06:00.680
Karate chop!!

06:01.480 --> 06:03.179
You can't destroy me!

06:04.682 --> 06:07.726
No... D-dad... I-I don't wanna destroy you...

06:08.045 --> 06:10.201
Look, just... stay out of my life!!

06:10.258 --> 06:11.683
You're not even alive!

06:13.206 --> 06:15.720
You blew it, dude. We're supposed to be a team—

06:15.839 --> 06:18.932
a team whose sport is stop-your-dad-from-suckin'-souls... ball.

06:19.881 --> 06:21.872
I just want my dad to care about me.

06:23.846 --> 06:29.239
Of all history's greatest monsters, 
you are by far the most evil thing I've encountered.

06:29.734 --> 06:32.121
Offer your soul to me, dark one.

06:32.234 --> 06:33.084
Wenk wenk.

06:33.203 --> 06:36.384
NO! You can't have my soul! I don't even...!

06:36.816 --> 06:37.978
Look, just get in here.

06:39.747 --> 06:40.353
Wenk wenk.

06:40.628 --> 06:41.953
Keep your crummy soul!

06:43.676 --> 06:46.100
Gunter! Who told you you could fly?!

06:46.207 --> 06:46.463
Wenk.

06:48.387 --> 06:52.918
 Huh? No one sucks the life from my penguins except me!

06:53.162 --> 06:56.287
...And maybe polar bears, because that's just nature, Gunter.

06:57.056 --> 07:00.099
You darest encroach upon my domain?!

07:00.287 --> 07:04.839
You've raised my frosty dander! And for that, I shall—

07:06.720 --> 07:11.002
AAAAAOOOOOHHH!! I've soiled my tunic... completely by choice!

07:15.564 --> 07:16.358
YES!!

07:18.833 --> 07:21.114
Aw, man! He's growing huge!

07:28.333 --> 07:30.432
I'm gonna take 'im down!

07:30.652 --> 07:32.158
Finn, you're like an ant to him.

07:32.319 --> 07:35.806
Oh, yeah? Well, this ant's about to get in his pants!

07:36.319 --> 07:36.782
What?

07:36.913 --> 07:37.500
Wha?

07:38.437 --> 07:41.949
Because I'm going to make him uncomfortable
 while I release those souls!

07:42.513 --> 07:45.156
RAAAAAAAAGH!!!

07:45.863 --> 07:48.037
Give up those souls, Marceline's dad!

07:48.112 --> 07:49.662
In the name of justice!!

07:49.863 --> 07:50.275
Huh?

07:50.743 --> 07:53.668
Oh, Marceline. Still following me?

07:53.794 --> 07:56.631
I'll stop following you if you give me back my guitar!

07:58.162 --> 07:59.293
No, Marceline.

07:59.756 --> 08:02.687
NO ONE FLICKS ME IN THE BUTT WITHOUT MY CONSENT!!!

08:05.231 --> 08:07.381
Whoa, WHOA!

08:10.225 --> 08:11.119
Whoooaa!!

08:11.986 --> 08:13.636
The souls...

08:13.829 --> 08:16.492
 Lumpy Space Princess! He got your soul, too?!

08:16.656 --> 08:17.856
What? Nah.

08:17.988 --> 08:21.137
I totally saw Hot Dog Princess get sucked in here,

08:21.268 --> 08:22.925
and I wasn't invited?!

08:23.104 --> 08:26.140
I was all, "What the lump?" so I'm crashin' this party!

08:27.737 --> 08:30.612
Well, I'll save you... I'LL SAVE ALL OF YOU!!

08:38.150 --> 08:39.663
IN YOUR FACE, DAD!

08:39.804 --> 08:43.067
Give back that ax, Marceline! 
You don't respect it enough!

08:43.442 --> 08:48.291
Well... you don't respect anything!
 Dad!! DAD!! I'm outta here!

08:48.400 --> 08:48.993
BUT—!!

08:49.143 --> 08:52.492
Fine!! Go!! I'm too busy sucking to deal with you!

08:52.762 --> 08:56.025
NO, WAIT! Marceline!! Keep talking to 'im!

08:56.198 --> 08:57.960
When he's talking, he can't steal souls!!

08:58.024 --> 08:59.712
I said I'm outta here!

08:59.905 --> 09:02.305
Diversion... need... diversion.

09:03.675 --> 09:07.009
Daddy, why did you eat my fries?

09:07.113 --> 09:10.342
I bought them, and they were mine.

09:11.750 --> 09:15.682
But you ate them, yeah, you ate my fries...

09:15.876 --> 09:19.815
And I cried, but you didn't see me cry.

09:20.854 --> 09:21.854
Daddy,

09:22.060 --> 09:24.193
Do you even love me?

09:24.254 --> 09:26.122
Well, I wish you'd show it,

09:24.871 --> 09:27.379
Oh, my Glob, you guys! Drama bomb!

09:27.954 --> 09:30.710
Marceline, do you really feel this way?

09:30.985 --> 09:31.979
Dad, I...

09:33.097 --> 09:35.559
Marceline... of course I love you.

09:35.748 --> 09:36.454
Dad...

09:36.554 --> 09:38.829
I'm sorry I ate your fries. I didn't mean to hurt you.

09:39.116 --> 09:41.353
It's okay, Dad. It's... it's really okay.

09:41.609 --> 09:44.947
No, it's not okay. They weren't even very good. They were really cold.

09:45.409 --> 09:48.859
I love you, Marceline. Don't you ever doubt that.

09:49.104 --> 09:50.142
I love you, too, Dad.

09:50.334 --> 09:52.171
Oh, Marceline, I am so—

09:52.204 --> 09:54.492
YALALALALALALALALALALALALA!!!!!

10:02.698 --> 10:05.204
MALOSO VOBISCUM ET CUM SPIRITUM!!

10:06.991 --> 10:10.141
I'll see you in the Nightosphere, ya sick freak.

10:11.010 --> 10:11.998
YES!!!!

10:12.479 --> 10:14.823
Finn!! How could you do that?!

10:14.892 --> 10:16.310
How could I... save the day?

10:16.417 --> 10:20.160
How could you embarrass me like that and then stab my dad?!

10:20.297 --> 10:22.134
How could I embarrass-save you??

10:22.179 --> 10:23.754
WHOA! Marceline!

10:25.091 --> 10:28.822
I'm glad he's back in the Nightosphere. 
That was emotionally exhausting.

10:29.060 --> 10:34.154
I'm also exhausted emotionally. Or... wait. 
I mean, I mean physically.

10:39.948 --> 10:42.997
I've been meaning to ask you... What's with that pocket on your shirt?

10:43.250 --> 10:45.037
Oh, Jake's in here. 'Sup, Jake?

10:45.438 --> 10:45.644
