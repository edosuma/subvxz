09:03.438 --> 09:05.355
Oh, this stinks.

09:05.357 --> 09:06.856
This stinks to holy hell!

09:06.858 --> 09:08.575
He's gonna win the bet!

09:08.577 --> 09:11.828
Baby, come on. Even if he was
sober as a nun,

09:11.830 --> 09:14.063
there's no way he could do what
these guys do.

09:14.065 --> 09:18.401
Exactly. I mean, to learn
the trademark secrets

09:18.403 --> 09:19.536
of Shinjitsu hibachi cooking,

09:19.538 --> 09:22.572
one would have to go
all the way...

09:22.574 --> 09:24.741
to Hoboken, New Jersey.

09:24.743 --> 09:27.744
Yeah, they have a school there.

09:27.746 --> 09:29.879
It's a six-month course.
They teach you everything.

09:29.881 --> 09:30.964
How do you know that?

09:30.966 --> 09:33.433
Maybe I looked it up
on my phone just now.

09:33.968 --> 09:37.137
Then again, maybe not.

09:43.277 --> 09:44.944
So Victoria's getting married.

09:44.946 --> 09:46.596
She's getting married.

09:46.598 --> 09:49.766
I'm sorry. I should have
told you that way earlier.

09:49.768 --> 09:51.117
No, no, it's fine.

09:51.119 --> 09:52.986
You thought something
was gonna happen.

09:52.988 --> 09:54.537
Like one percent.

09:54.539 --> 09:56.539
Maybe slap on a ring next time.

09:56.541 --> 09:58.608
Well, the problem is,
he hasn't asked me yet.

09:58.610 --> 10:01.277
I found the ring in a box
in his sock drawer.

10:01.279 --> 10:04.714
Wow! Guy's got a whole drawer
just for socks?

10:04.716 --> 10:06.299
Must be nice.

10:07.234 --> 10:09.919
So when's Money Bags
popping the question?

10:09.921 --> 10:11.221
I'm pretty sure tomorrow.

10:11.223 --> 10:12.388
He's taking me out

10:12.390 --> 10:14.957
to a really nice restaurant out
in the Hamptons.

10:14.959 --> 10:16.810
It's right on the water,

10:16.812 --> 10:21.631
so afterwards we'll take a walk
on the beach in the moonlight.

10:21.633 --> 10:23.466
You should probably go.

10:23.468 --> 10:25.535
I don't know.
It sounds pretty intimate.

10:27.688 --> 10:29.972
I'm serious. I feel
like I misled you.

10:29.974 --> 10:34.310
Madam, I came here
to wash your dishes.

10:34.312 --> 10:35.612
Nothing more.

10:36.580 --> 10:38.314
- Whoa! What was that!?
- What was what?

10:38.316 --> 10:41.000
This guy and Barney
just shared a look!

10:41.002 --> 10:42.285
Do you know him?

10:45.840 --> 10:48.041
They did it again!

10:48.043 --> 10:50.043
This whole thing stinks,
I tells ya!

10:50.045 --> 10:51.494
It stinks!

10:51.496 --> 10:55.682
Lily, are you really suggesting
that Barney spent six months

10:55.684 --> 10:58.101
commuting back and forth
to Hoboken

10:58.103 --> 11:00.587
to learn a signature cooking
style of a restaurant

11:00.589 --> 11:03.156
he doesn't even like
so he could win a bet

11:03.158 --> 11:04.858
he hadn't even made yet?

11:04.860 --> 11:06.860
Yeah, the whole thing stinks.

11:06.862 --> 11:09.112
No, it's not possible, okay?

11:09.114 --> 11:11.180
I was the one who said
let's go to Shinjitsu...

11:11.182 --> 11:12.782
Bless you.

11:12.784 --> 11:14.951
How could Barney have...

11:19.874 --> 11:21.825
You brilliant bastard.

11:21.827 --> 11:23.543
It's all so obvious now.

11:23.545 --> 11:25.795
For the past, oh, I don't
know how long, five years,

11:25.797 --> 11:27.831
every time I've said,
"Let's go to Shinjitsu""

11:27.833 --> 11:28.915
Bless you.

11:28.917 --> 11:32.051
You've sneezed.

11:32.053 --> 11:33.369
Every time.

11:33.371 --> 11:34.954
<i>And little by little...</i>

11:34.956 --> 11:36.589
Let's go to Shinjitsu.

11:36.591 --> 11:38.541
Bless you. Bless you.

11:38.543 --> 11:41.711
<i>...you forged the association</i>
<i>in my brain.</i>

11:41.713 --> 11:43.029
So what should we do for dinner?

11:43.031 --> 11:44.547
Let's go to Shinjitsu.

11:44.549 --> 11:45.815
Oh, bless you.
Thanks.

11:45.817 --> 11:47.734
<i>Until eventually...</i>

11:47.736 --> 11:50.186
Yes, I know I said that
we'd be back Sunday,

11:50.188 --> 11:51.988
but guess what?
We are back now!

11:51.990 --> 11:53.055
Now what on earth...

11:53.057 --> 11:54.440
Stop bouncing!
What on earth

11:54.442 --> 11:56.225
would make you think that
we'd be okay with this?

11:56.227 --> 11:59.012
Let's go to Shinjitsu.

11:59.014 --> 12:00.914
When you were sick
for a week last year,

12:00.916 --> 12:03.199
I had Shinjitsu
like six times.

12:03.951 --> 12:05.285
You had the knife skills...

12:05.903 --> 12:07.871
you had the trigger...

12:07.873 --> 12:11.124
All you needed then was
to want something from me.

12:11.126 --> 12:15.178
And then one day... those
somethings came a-busting out.

12:15.180 --> 12:17.297
Wapowng!

12:17.299 --> 12:19.299
I am gonna have
to walk this earth,

12:19.301 --> 12:22.418
knowing Barney has
touched my boobs.

12:22.420 --> 12:24.420
Yeah. It stays with you.

12:24.422 --> 12:27.090
His email reminders don't help.

12:27.092 --> 12:28.808
Okay, Lily, this is ridiculous.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.560
If you want to
call the bet off...

12:30.562 --> 12:31.778
Great! The bet's off!

12:31.780 --> 12:33.329
Let me finish.

12:33.331 --> 12:36.933
If
you let me just see them--

12:36.935 --> 12:39.118
no touching, just looking--
for one minute...

12:39.120 --> 12:40.653
30 seconds.
For 30 seconds,

12:40.655 --> 12:42.104
in a well-lit
photography studio...

12:42.106 --> 12:43.907
- In the alley.
- In the alley...

12:43.909 --> 12:45.491
then we'll cancel this
entire wager completely.

12:45.493 --> 12:46.826
Do we have a deal?

12:48.278 --> 12:49.746
I totally think you
should take the deal.

12:49.748 --> 12:51.280
I don't think we have a choice.

12:51.282 --> 12:52.465
Go on, take the deal.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.584
I'll... think about it.

12:57.638 --> 12:59.005
So you're doing the dishes...

12:59.007 --> 13:00.340
I'm doing the dishes.

13:00.342 --> 13:02.392
All done.

13:02.394 --> 13:03.676
Congratulations.

13:03.678 --> 13:07.129
Your karmic slate is
clean and lemony fresh.

13:07.131 --> 13:09.131
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

13:09.133 --> 13:11.484
See, now I can start anew,

13:11.486 --> 13:14.354
and hopefully end up as
happy as you and, uh...

13:14.356 --> 13:15.605
Sorry, what's his name?

13:15.607 --> 13:17.657
- Whose name?
- Your fiancé-to-be.

13:17.659 --> 13:19.275
Oh! His name is Klaus.

13:19.277 --> 13:21.394
- Klaus.
- Klaus.

13:21.396 --> 13:22.645
German name.

13:22.647 --> 13:25.381
- Yeah, German guy.
- Hmm.

13:25.383 --> 13:27.867
When you were
living in Germany,

13:27.869 --> 13:30.003
and we were doing the whole
long-distance thing...

13:30.005 --> 13:31.754
wasn't there a Klaus
in your class?

13:31.756 --> 13:33.039
There was a Klaus in my class.

13:33.041 --> 13:35.324
- And you and Klaus were close.
- Not that close.

13:35.326 --> 13:37.593
Yes, yes, you and the Klaus from
your class were quite close.

13:37.595 --> 13:38.678
Kind of close.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.813
- Was that your Klaus?
- My Klaus?

13:40.815 --> 13:42.115
- In your class.
- In my class?

13:42.117 --> 13:44.417
Is your Klaus the kind of
close Klaus from your class?

13:44.419 --> 13:45.852
Yes.

13:48.022 --> 13:50.172
You didn't cheat on me
with Klaus, did you?

13:50.174 --> 13:52.508
- No. No, I did not.
- Mm.

13:52.510 --> 13:53.860
Okay, new question.

13:53.862 --> 13:56.062
After we broke up,
how long were you single

13:56.064 --> 13:58.314
before you and Klaus
started dating?

13:58.316 --> 14:02.368
Oh, how long... um, well,
we broke up in April, so...

14:02.370 --> 14:04.203
a day and a half.

14:04.205 --> 14:08.574
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me!

14:08.576 --> 14:09.792
I'm sorry.

14:09.794 --> 14:11.961
So I've spent the last
six years feeling like

14:11.963 --> 14:15.698
I completely betrayed you,
when in truth, you...

14:15.700 --> 14:17.884
No, you know what?

14:21.389 --> 14:22.872
Okay. Fine.

14:22.874 --> 14:25.641
Just let yourself off the hook
on a technicality!

14:25.643 --> 14:27.844
Forget the fact that
you did cheat on me!

14:27.846 --> 14:31.597
Forget it? I will
never forget it. Okay?

14:31.599 --> 14:32.982
I will never stop regretting it,

14:32.984 --> 14:34.851
because what we had
meant that much to me!

14:34.853 --> 14:37.219
I just... I wish it had meant
something to you, too.

14:37.221 --> 14:38.554
Are you kidding?

14:38.556 --> 14:40.623
- I loved you!
- Did you?

14:40.625 --> 14:42.108
Yes.

14:42.110 --> 14:47.730
We had such an amazing
time together.

14:47.732 --> 14:48.915
Do you remember that night

14:48.917 --> 14:50.400
we found that crazy
videotape of Barney?

14:50.402 --> 14:52.869
Game night.

14:52.871 --> 14:54.537
We played that ridiculous
game Marshall invented.

14:54.539 --> 14:56.072
- Marshgammon.
- Yeah.

14:56.074 --> 14:58.408
We've played it a few times
since. I still don't get it.

14:58.410 --> 14:59.876
Remember the night we met?

14:59.878 --> 15:02.795
I remember you not
letting me kiss you.

15:02.797 --> 15:04.414
Remember why?

15:04.416 --> 15:06.432
You had this ridiculous idea

15:06.434 --> 15:08.351
that the moment leading
up to the kiss...

15:08.353 --> 15:09.302
The drum roll.

15:09.304 --> 15:11.637
...is as good as
the kiss itself.

15:11.639 --> 15:13.222
Isn't it?

15:13.224 --> 15:15.141
Well, it's certainly
more innocent.

15:15.143 --> 15:16.526
It's completely harmless.

15:16.528 --> 15:18.394
Completely.

15:32.268 --> 15:33.468
- Oh, my God!
- Oh no.

15:33.470 --> 15:34.987
No, no-no-no-no-no.

15:34.989 --> 15:37.139
- I should not have done that.
- No, that was me.

15:37.141 --> 15:40.108
I let you come wash my dishes!

15:40.110 --> 15:41.777
I said my "oven"
needed "cleaning"!

15:41.779 --> 15:43.845
I invited you into a porno!

15:43.847 --> 15:45.197
No.

15:45.199 --> 15:47.065
You were right. This is fate.

15:47.067 --> 15:49.067
I needed to see
you one more time

15:49.069 --> 15:50.903
in order to know
for sure about Klaus.

15:50.905 --> 15:52.704
And...?

15:52.706 --> 15:55.240
And...

15:56.843 --> 15:59.695
I have a bus to catch.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.717
Fine, you can see my boobs!

16:05.719 --> 16:06.718
To the alley!

16:06.720 --> 16:09.338
This seems unfair.

16:09.340 --> 16:11.673
I mean, I get that
I'm the only person

16:11.675 --> 16:13.058
not allowed to see this, but...

16:13.060 --> 16:15.644
it just, it-it seems unfair.

16:15.646 --> 16:17.095
Come on, Lily, hurry up.

16:17.097 --> 16:18.647
Guys...

16:18.649 --> 16:21.767
You know, I'm all for honoring a
bet, but who invited Takumi?

16:22.902 --> 16:24.603
Sorry, bro.
I tried.

16:29.692 --> 16:31.393
What's going on?
What am I missing?

16:31.395 --> 16:33.495
Are they out yet?
What do they look like?

16:33.497 --> 16:34.830
Look, I don't want to know!

16:34.832 --> 16:36.231
Just tell me the kind of coin.

16:36.233 --> 16:39.001
Do you know how long
30 seconds is?

16:39.003 --> 16:42.254
It's going to be five seconds of...

16:42.256 --> 16:44.840
followed by 25 seconds of....

16:45.758 --> 16:48.293
I mean, yes,
seeing Lily's boobs

16:48.295 --> 16:50.796
is all you've ever
wanted, but come on.

16:50.798 --> 16:53.799
All he's ever wanted...

16:53.801 --> 16:55.217
Lily, stop!

16:55.219 --> 16:57.352
Don't you see?

16:57.354 --> 17:00.355
This was his plan all along!

17:00.357 --> 17:03.892
He let us think he knows how
to do all this Shinjitsu stuff,

17:03.894 --> 17:05.926
just so he could
get you out here

17:05.929 --> 17:08.063
whipping out your milk-makers!

17:08.065 --> 17:10.898
You son of a bitch!

17:10.901 --> 17:12.701
The bet is back on!

17:13.486 --> 17:15.770
Nice try, Barney!

17:15.771 --> 17:17.739
Nice try.

17:31.288 --> 17:33.939
Maybe I was wrong.

17:33.941 --> 17:36.341
Well, I guess that's everything
you asked me to do, is it not?

17:36.343 --> 17:38.760
Oh, wait! The shrimp
in the pocket.

17:38.762 --> 17:40.012
A modern classic.

17:40.014 --> 17:41.046
And now...

17:41.048 --> 17:43.899
for one minute on second base...

17:43.901 --> 17:46.818
with a firm yet
sensual squeeze...

17:46.820 --> 17:48.453
Nothing can stop him now.

17:48.455 --> 17:50.122
One thing can.

17:50.124 --> 17:51.490
Make that two things.

18:12.195 --> 18:14.179
No!!

18:14.181 --> 18:17.683
Yeah!
Yeah!

18:17.685 --> 18:19.551
So you take her to the bus...

18:19.553 --> 18:21.219
I take her to the bus.

18:22.555 --> 18:24.106
Well, this feels familiar.

18:24.108 --> 18:27.309
You leaving, me kind of
wanting to say, "Don't go""

18:27.311 --> 18:28.694
Little late for that.

18:28.696 --> 18:30.696
Little bit.

18:30.698 --> 18:32.647
- Don't go.
- Ted...

18:32.649 --> 18:34.399
I'm sorry. I just...

18:34.401 --> 18:36.201
Why didn't I say it then?

18:36.203 --> 18:38.954
Why'd I let you
get on that plane?

18:38.956 --> 18:41.890
Why didn't I get on it with you?

18:41.892 --> 18:45.460
What would our lives be
right now, if we had just...

18:45.462 --> 18:47.913
held on?

18:47.915 --> 18:50.365
Would I have still run into
you at this party tonight...

18:50.367 --> 18:52.334
or would we have been
there together?

18:52.336 --> 18:54.503
We'd go home...

18:54.505 --> 18:56.872
to our home?

18:57.924 --> 19:01.426
You cook. I do the dishes.

19:02.562 --> 19:04.146
I'm happy that you're happy.

19:04.148 --> 19:07.232
But damn it.

19:07.234 --> 19:08.483
What if?

19:08.485 --> 19:11.103
Do you really want
to know the answer to that?

19:11.105 --> 19:13.271
No.

19:14.723 --> 19:16.224
I think it would kill me.

19:16.226 --> 19:18.893
Good-bye, Ted.

19:29.205 --> 19:32.407
And that was it.

19:32.409 --> 19:35.260
Now she's probably engaged.

19:36.679 --> 19:39.581
Maybe it's for the best.

19:41.684 --> 19:45.437
All right. Well...

19:45.439 --> 19:47.322
We're gonna duck out.

19:48.758 --> 19:51.109
Sorry to leave you
with the bill.

19:51.111 --> 19:55.614
Oh, guys, it's gonna
be a good year.

19:56.932 --> 19:58.150
I'm glad you guys can laugh,

19:58.152 --> 20:00.152
'cause I think I'm gonna
be physically ill.

20:00.154 --> 20:01.736
Coming down with a mallardy?

20:01.738 --> 20:03.989
Oh, they look hungry.
There you go.

20:03.991 --> 20:05.624
Here you go.

20:05.626 --> 20:08.293
<i>Kids, there was</i>
<i>one part I left out.</i>

20:08.295 --> 20:10.295
Good-bye, Ted.

20:12.448 --> 20:15.617
Okay, yes.
What's the answer?

20:17.587 --> 20:23.141
There is a reason that it didn't
work out between you and me,

20:23.143 --> 20:25.093
but it's not Germany.

20:25.095 --> 20:27.712
And I'm willing to bet it's the
same reason none of your other

20:27.714 --> 20:30.131
relationships in the last
six years have lasted either.

20:30.133 --> 20:31.483
It's Robin.

20:32.635 --> 20:33.685
No.

20:33.687 --> 20:35.103
Yes.

20:35.105 --> 20:38.106
She is so much bigger
in your world than you realize.

20:38.108 --> 20:41.660
And this thing that you're all
doing, you and Barney and Robin,

20:41.662 --> 20:44.946
where the three of you hang out
at the bar night in, night out,

20:44.948 --> 20:46.832
like you're all just buddies?

20:46.834 --> 20:49.417
That doesn't work. Trust me.

20:49.419 --> 20:51.419
You-You've got it all wrong.

20:51.421 --> 20:53.138
I'm right about this.

20:55.007 --> 20:56.842
Good-bye, Ted.

21:00.655 --> 21:03.155
And sure enough, <i>she was right.</i>

21:03.157 --> 21:05.574
<i>It didn't work;</i>
<i>we just didn't realize it yet.</i>
