00:14.082 --> 00:16.550
<i>We all have different stories
to tell.</i>

00:19.387 --> 00:21.955
<i>Sometimes about the same events.</i>

00:23.624 --> 00:26.560
<i>Sure, when times are good,
we might</i>

00:26.660 --> 00:28.496
<i>remember things the same way.</i>

00:30.431 --> 00:32.633
<i>But when times are tough,</i>

00:32.733 --> 00:34.635
<i>when some things happen
that might not be easy</i>

00:34.735 --> 00:36.937
<i>to talk about or look at,</i>

00:37.037 --> 00:40.941
<i>that's when we must fight
to find the truth.</i>

00:52.853 --> 00:55.689
<i>Aubree, my love...</i>

00:56.490 --> 01:00.128
<i>I've been having that feeling,
like something bad is coming.</i>

01:02.463 --> 01:04.798
<i>Seems I was right.</i>

01:04.898 --> 01:06.300
<i>I shouldn't have left.</i>

01:06.400 --> 01:08.136
<i>I thought I was running
from not being able</i>

01:08.136 --> 01:10.504
<i>to provide for you
the way I wanted.</i>

01:11.305 --> 01:15.576
<i>But turns out...
I was running from myself.</i>

01:28.556 --> 01:31.259
Just let me...

01:31.359 --> 01:32.860
let me finish my letter.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.229
Who you writing to?

01:37.165 --> 01:40.901
Family, back home
in Louisiana.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.005
I've always wanted to go there.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.042
Why is that?

01:49.977 --> 01:51.645
I heard the food was good.

01:59.420 --> 02:04.458
This arrow, it ain't yours
by any chance?

02:04.558 --> 02:06.327
Might be.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.796
Hmm.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.266
- Fighting over?
- For now.

02:13.201 --> 02:16.103
- But you always come back.
- I'm not them.

02:16.204 --> 02:19.573
I couldn't carry out my orders.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.975
I'm done.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.212
And I don't know what to do now.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.881
Not that it matters.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.353
You can leave.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.955
Go back to your family.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.691
Those men in uniforms

02:37.791 --> 02:40.661
don't take too kindly
to deserters.

02:41.929 --> 02:45.866
If I go back now,
I put my family at risk.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.802
Then head the other way.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.339
Further west.

02:51.439 --> 02:54.508
That an invite?

02:54.608 --> 02:57.911
If you need one.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.277
They're not gonna kill you.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.146
Well, that's a relief.

03:33.281 --> 03:36.784
Can you... can you tell them
I said thank you?

03:36.884 --> 03:40.153
I spoke to the others
about you staying.

03:40.288 --> 03:43.190
It's gonna take time for some
not to see you as an enemy.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.959
Well, I guess we lead
by example.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.898
Thank you for helping me,

03:50.998 --> 03:53.133
for giving me sanctuary.

03:58.138 --> 04:01.542
It's a place you go
to find peace.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.911
It's safe.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.947
Teach me more of those words.

04:11.419 --> 04:15.088
Long as you teach me
some of yours.

04:22.696 --> 04:26.534
Hey. Thought I'd make
myself useful

04:26.634 --> 04:29.036
by making the weapon
that got me.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.976
Calian, what's wrong?

04:36.944 --> 04:39.580
I have some news.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.350
From town?

04:42.350 --> 04:46.119
From the sheriff who's been
mailing your letters.

04:46.219 --> 04:49.957
He received a message
from Louisiana.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.092
From my family?

05:14.247 --> 05:16.450
<i>I know you're gone,</i>

05:16.550 --> 05:21.121
<i>but I still need to do this,
to write to you.</i>

05:21.221 --> 05:25.092
<i>Maybe it's a way
to keep your memory alive.</i>

05:25.192 --> 05:28.696
<i>To remind myself of us.</i>

05:28.796 --> 05:32.400
<i>Maybe it's to tell
this part of our history.</i>

05:32.500 --> 05:33.634
<i>You must be Augustus.</i>

05:33.734 --> 05:35.669
Calian said
you'd be coming in.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.138
Sheriff.

05:43.411 --> 05:46.113
Take a seat.
Want some water?

05:46.213 --> 05:48.115
Thank you.

05:48.215 --> 05:53.086
My condolences
about your family.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.255
Wasn't your fault.

05:55.423 --> 05:58.559
Not being there.
Back home.

05:58.659 --> 06:03.464
Sheriff, I'm here to
turn myself in for desertion.

06:06.266 --> 06:10.571
Jail time
or the firing squad.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.242
Heavy consequences
for desertion.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.180
I'm aware of that.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.450
So you do blame yourself.

06:22.550 --> 06:26.854
I can't live my life
as a fugitive.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.460
And I got somebody
up there now

06:32.560 --> 06:34.361
that's looking down on me.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.130
I won't let her down again.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.266
So will you take me
to Fort Worth

06:39.366 --> 06:41.301
so I can face my charges?

06:41.469 --> 06:44.171
I think there's another way
to handle all this.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.274
How's that?

06:51.344 --> 06:52.646
I need a new deputy.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.347
Someone I can trust
to watch my back...

06:54.482 --> 06:56.550
You're offering me a job?

06:56.650 --> 06:57.885
It was Calian's idea, actually.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.153
And I have to say,
the more he talked,

07:00.253 --> 07:01.889
the more I liked.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.825
Educated, speak more than one
language, military experience...

07:04.925 --> 07:08.729
Sheriff, you want a deserter
for a deputy?

07:08.829 --> 07:10.030
Well, son,

07:10.130 --> 07:14.367
the way I understand it,
you made a tough choice.

07:14.502 --> 07:17.070
Saw your enemy eye to eye.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.773
Easier to squeeze that trigger.

07:19.873 --> 07:23.276
And here you are,
making another tough choice.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.178
Rather than be a criminal,

07:25.278 --> 07:27.347
you want to face
the consequences,

07:27.515 --> 07:29.650
even when you know
that could mean death.

07:29.750 --> 07:33.621
Wearing the badge
comes with hard choices.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.523
And you strike me as a man

07:35.523 --> 07:38.526
who's made them
his whole life.

07:38.626 --> 07:41.862
I never considered being
a lawman.

07:50.604 --> 07:53.574
Neither did I.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.345
Calian said you deserve
a new life.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.914
This could be your chance
to find it.

08:02.750 --> 08:06.419
This badge needs you
more than you need it.

08:09.422 --> 08:13.694
<i>Sometimes when we feel like
it's the end of a story,</i>

08:13.794 --> 08:17.464
<i>a life, a new one
presents itself in ways</i>

08:17.565 --> 08:20.467
<i>that makes us want
to live again,</i>

08:20.568 --> 08:23.336
<i>to write a new chapter.</i>

08:23.436 --> 08:25.272
<i>To find purpose.</i>

08:25.372 --> 08:27.140
One more thing.

08:30.077 --> 08:34.582
Calian told me
your last deputy was killed.

08:34.582 --> 08:37.651
Found in a ravine,
shot in the back.

08:37.751 --> 08:41.589
You didn't attend his funeral.

08:41.689 --> 08:45.826
You killed him, didn't you?

08:45.926 --> 08:49.597
I had to. He turned on me.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.765
On this town.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.336
Just 'cause you wear the badge

08:56.436 --> 08:59.006
doesn't mean you're
above the law.

08:59.106 --> 09:02.175
I'll remember that.

09:21.995 --> 09:26.033
Let me show you the town, Deputy.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.117
<i>Whether it's
by choice or circumstance,</i>

09:44.217 --> 09:48.155
<i>folks come from all over
for a new life out west.</i>

09:48.255 --> 09:50.758
<i>While some embrace
the opportunity,</i>

09:50.858 --> 09:53.694
<i>others are simply escaping
a past.</i>

09:55.095 --> 09:57.197
<i>Or maybe themselves
as they step foot</i>

09:57.297 --> 09:58.465
<i>off their stagecoach.</i>

09:58.565 --> 10:01.301
Hey! Hey!

10:02.302 --> 10:05.138
Thanks for your support.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.022
Can always use
more prostitutes there,

10:22.122 --> 10:24.257
now that the train's coming,
little lady.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.293
Why don't you try
calling me that again,

10:26.393 --> 10:28.128
see how unladylike I can be.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.071
Good morning, sir.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.207
You wouldn't, by any chance,
be looking for some assistance

10:40.307 --> 10:41.942
with all of your, um...

10:42.042 --> 10:43.877
whatever it is that
you do here? I...

10:43.977 --> 10:46.880
Uh, I mean, I can't say that
I've castrated a bull

10:46.980 --> 10:48.381
or skinned a bear
in the technical sense,

10:48.481 --> 10:49.917
but I'm more than willing
to learn.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.451
I am seeking gainful employment,
preferably indoors.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.020
You know, that town's
gonna get a whole lot busier

10:53.120 --> 10:54.354
with the train coming through.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.093
Hi. I...

11:12.773 --> 11:15.275
Yeah, you can sit here

11:15.375 --> 11:19.379
in the shade if you want.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.314
Thank you.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.052
Oh.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.098
Did you ever have
one of those days where you,

11:38.198 --> 11:39.466
you just want to crawl
into a hole

11:39.566 --> 11:41.068
until it's all over with,
you get a new one?

11:44.772 --> 11:46.606
Don't mind the bitter days.

11:46.774 --> 11:50.077
They give the sweet ones
their flavor.

11:52.312 --> 11:55.949
I always hated when my father
would talk like that.

11:56.049 --> 12:00.353
Offering wisdom
like a simple recipe.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.792
And here I am.

12:09.496 --> 12:12.532
All right, I could sit
out here all day, but...

12:12.632 --> 12:15.002
You need to find a job?

12:15.102 --> 12:19.272
I do need to find a job.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.475
Honestly, I'm pretty certain
of where I'll end up,

12:22.575 --> 12:24.277
but I thought I'd get
the lay of the land

12:24.377 --> 12:25.979
while I could.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.515
<i>We're all searching for a home.</i>

12:28.615 --> 12:31.318
<i>A place where we feel
like we belong.</i>

12:31.418 --> 12:33.020
Mm. Thank you.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.857
<i>Sometimes that place
is actually a person...</i>

12:36.957 --> 12:38.725
Someone left this behind,

12:38.826 --> 12:41.428
but I think it is yours now.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.630
<i>...who seems to know you already...</i>

12:44.832 --> 12:46.466
<i>...without having to say much.</i>

12:46.566 --> 12:49.336
That's ridiculous.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.871
No more sun.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.640
No more sun.
Thank you.

13:12.159 --> 13:17.030
What is that? Huh?

13:17.130 --> 13:20.267
Kicking in place
with frowns on your faces.

13:20.367 --> 13:24.037
Obstinate toy soldiers!

13:24.137 --> 13:25.873
I should do the show myself.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.341
Better than the cadavers
I see before me.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.478
You know what, get out. Out!

13:31.578 --> 13:33.213
Go!

13:33.313 --> 13:36.016
And don't come back
until you care.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.588
That was inspiring.

13:41.688 --> 13:44.057
Excuse me?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.658
You know, you could have
offered up something

13:45.758 --> 13:47.194
that you like.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.595
You could have walked them
through what you expect

13:48.695 --> 13:50.097
- without all the...
- Buzz off, little bee.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.132
Tone. Charming.
I heard you were hiring.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.635
Toilet scrubber.
50 cents a day,

13:55.735 --> 13:59.072
dollar room and board.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.569
Help now!

14:34.174 --> 14:35.375
<i>Hey.</i>

14:36.944 --> 14:39.146
You okay?

14:39.246 --> 14:42.515
You know, you can't talk
to people that way.

14:44.952 --> 14:48.388
You need to be careful
with people. They're fragile.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.958
Come again?

14:51.691 --> 14:53.726
The show.
Th-There's no spontaneity.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.295
They don't,
they don't feel safe.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.964
You talking about my dancers?

14:56.964 --> 14:58.798
Well, they're not yours.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.533
They need to feel free
up there, they need to feel

15:00.633 --> 15:02.202
like they can reinvent themselves.

15:02.302 --> 15:05.172
Any other ideas?

15:05.272 --> 15:06.606
Dollar a day,

15:06.706 --> 15:08.808
free room and board,
I'll help you run things.

15:08.976 --> 15:12.980
Who are you? Huh?

15:12.980 --> 15:15.582
Well, I have a colleague,
whispered in my ear

15:15.682 --> 15:18.451
about her time here, memories.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.322
She said, uh, it might suit me.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.758
You know, it feels like
I'm auditioning for you.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.827
You are.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.729
Hmm.

15:31.198 --> 15:33.200
Afternoon, Deputy.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.168
Oh. Afternoon.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.005
Yeah, you must be running
the show over there at Hagan's.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.439
Oh, I-I'm running <i>a</i> show.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.141
I wouldn't say
I'm running <i>the</i> show.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.575
For the moment, anyway.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.577
- You have a lovely day.
- You, too.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.514
<i>It's awful powerful to see
how transformative it can be</i>

15:47.614 --> 15:49.916
<i>to feel like you have a home.</i>

15:50.017 --> 15:51.518
<i>A community.</i>

15:51.618 --> 15:54.254
<i>People who share your way
of looking at the world.</i>

15:54.354 --> 15:58.025
<i>It anchors you and gives you
stability and strength.</i>

16:00.293 --> 16:01.761
<i>Without it, hell,</i>

16:01.861 --> 16:03.396
<i>it can feel
like you're a tumbleweed</i>

16:03.496 --> 16:06.033
<i>blowing in the wind.</i>

16:09.369 --> 16:12.505
<i>Sometimes the path we're on
is clouded by the ones</i>

16:12.605 --> 16:15.042
<i>who brought us into this world.</i>

16:16.043 --> 16:20.380
Mama... why are we back here?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.149
Thought we'd swing by
where you were born

16:22.249 --> 16:23.483
while we pass through.

16:23.583 --> 16:24.917
Why didn't we stay?

16:25.052 --> 16:28.455
'Cause it was nothing back then.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.956
And it's not much better now.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.794
You tired of seeing
the world with me?

16:34.894 --> 16:37.630
You want to put down roots
and quit living?

16:37.730 --> 16:38.631
Never.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.601
That's my Hoyt.

16:41.701 --> 16:42.835
All right, you ready
to take some money

16:42.935 --> 16:43.870
from some people
that don't need it?

16:43.970 --> 16:45.072
What's the play?

16:45.172 --> 16:48.641
You be adorable,
flash those big blues

16:48.741 --> 16:50.177
while Mama cleans up.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.079
When I give you the signal,
act like your tummy aches

16:52.179 --> 16:53.280
to high heaven.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.683
Let's go have some fun.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.100
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening to you, miss.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.668
- Nice boots, cowboy.
- Thank you, young man.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.938
- Ah, I'm so sorry.
- Well, that's okay, ma'am.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.940
How high can you count, mister?

17:21.108 --> 17:22.442
Pretty high, young fella.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.347
<i>One, two, three... ♪</i>

17:27.447 --> 17:30.783
Help me! Oh, God. Aah!

17:30.883 --> 17:33.220
It feels like there's eels
in my tummy

17:33.320 --> 17:34.521
squirming to get out!

17:34.621 --> 17:35.988
Now take it easy, son.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.125
Try to stay calm
and tell us where it hurts.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.960
Oh, it seems the good Lord's
punishing me

17:41.128 --> 17:43.596
for all those delicious lollipops.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.765
Well, how many did you eat?

17:45.865 --> 17:47.967
Young man, where are
your parents?

17:48.135 --> 17:51.771
- Oh!
- Let's get you to the doctor.

17:51.871 --> 17:55.041
Thanks for opening
your hearts to us.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.446
Hey, where's my watch?

17:59.546 --> 18:02.182
Lollipop city, kid.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.917
Stella Rawlins.

18:05.017 --> 18:08.721
No, I'm, um...
I'm Beatrice Farley.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.457
You used that one in Gallop.

18:10.557 --> 18:13.360
And then you used Lenora Carrol
in Corpus Christi.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.328
Ma'am,

18:15.428 --> 18:18.365
you're under arrest
for robbery, theft,

18:18.465 --> 18:20.500
public indecency.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.834
Mama.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.340
I need, I need to get him
to the Reyes ranch

18:27.440 --> 18:28.575
outside of town.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.510
You're coming with me
right now.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.079
Okay.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.482
Okay, Hoyt, this is
what you're gonna do.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.384
- Listen to me...
- I'll find you,

18:37.484 --> 18:40.019
bust you out, Mama.

18:40.187 --> 18:43.223
My little outlaw.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.727
I will come back for you
as soon as I settle all this.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.899
Come on, ma'am, let's go.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.244
I always knew
it'd end this way.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.280
I love you, Mama.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.023
<i>Even if we could
outrun those clouds</i>

19:17.123 --> 19:19.392
<i>that follow us
our whole lives,</i>

19:19.492 --> 19:23.463
<i>deep down we'd know
we just missed the rain.</i>

19:39.011 --> 19:41.914
Feel like I seen you before.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.253
Maybe I just got
one of those faces.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.623
You waiting for the train?

19:52.625 --> 19:54.861
Train?

19:56.629 --> 19:59.266
Train come all the way
out here?

20:03.936 --> 20:08.741
So, what'd
the three-legged dog say

20:08.841 --> 20:10.243
when he walked in the saloon?

20:10.343 --> 20:13.346
"I'm looking for the man
who shot my paw."

20:17.984 --> 20:21.220
So, how you gonna do it?

20:23.290 --> 20:24.557
Now, what's that?

20:24.657 --> 20:29.128
Catch... the train.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.465
Ah.

20:32.565 --> 20:36.068
I'm thinking I, uh,
let you distract 'em,

20:36.168 --> 20:38.170
then ride up the other side
where they ain't looking.

20:38.271 --> 20:42.375
It seems kind of easy, don't it?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.078
So, you making small talk

20:46.178 --> 20:48.047
'cause you're ready
to partner up?

20:52.084 --> 20:55.922
I lost my only good partner
a long time ago.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.157
Ain't looking for a new one.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.067
Well, that's too bad.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.572
You, uh...

21:14.807 --> 21:17.043
You got any more jokes?

21:37.497 --> 21:39.532
No more ruining my punch lines.

21:53.946 --> 21:56.449
You got to be kidding me.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.660
What have I gotten myself
into now?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.742
Hello.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.413
Hoyt Rawlins?

22:27.880 --> 22:30.016
Lucia Reyes.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.619
Are you going in there?

22:32.719 --> 22:35.688
- Well, H-Hagan's was all booked.
- Huh.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.724
For some reason
I don't believe you.

22:37.824 --> 22:41.127
Well, why don't we
stroll up there, find out?

22:41.227 --> 22:43.563
Stay the night.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.432
And what would I tell
my family?

22:45.432 --> 22:47.500
I don't know, you left town.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.836
This old song.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.438
Oh, you love this song.

22:51.538 --> 22:54.941
You know, you still haven't
given me a good reason

22:55.041 --> 22:57.544
why you won't sing it with me.

23:00.346 --> 23:04.083
Whenever I'm in town,
I walk by the sheriff's

23:04.183 --> 23:07.587
and look at the new
wanted posters.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.188
Sadly, that's the only way
of knowing

23:09.288 --> 23:11.524
if you might pass through.

23:11.624 --> 23:14.861
Look, it's hard for me
to be here, Lucia.

23:14.961 --> 23:17.163
Some good memories.

23:19.265 --> 23:21.367
Some not so good.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.336
You're just like her.

23:24.471 --> 23:26.839
I read the paper.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.241
Even the Pinkertons are
after you now.

23:32.378 --> 23:34.847
Maybe next time, Hoyt.

23:50.396 --> 23:51.964
Boss just sent me
for his laundry.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.366
- Just one second.
In the back.
- Of course.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.512
What the hell?

24:09.248 --> 24:10.983
Say, did you hear that news
about the preacher

24:11.083 --> 24:12.519
in Angel Springs?

24:12.519 --> 24:14.754
He died last night in the loving
embrace of a White Dove.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.689
I hope his prayers
were answered.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.525
Oh, yeah, somehow
I feel like they were.

24:18.525 --> 24:21.327
- I'll see you tomorrow, Kai.
- Tomorrow.

24:43.249 --> 24:44.450
In trouble again?

24:44.551 --> 24:46.418
Just need to hide out
for a minute.

24:46.553 --> 24:49.556
Oh, got you something.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.091
Don't make a deal out of that.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.694
What is this?

24:54.794 --> 24:56.863
Well, with me all over
and you here,

24:56.963 --> 24:59.766
I figure I'd give you a look
into the world out there.

24:59.866 --> 25:03.335
They're calling 'em
"post cards."

25:03.435 --> 25:04.871
Thank you.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.673
Yeah.

25:06.773 --> 25:07.674
You sure I can't help?

25:07.774 --> 25:11.177
Uh, food. Anything?

25:11.277 --> 25:15.247
You know, there is something
you can do for me.

25:15.347 --> 25:19.485
Any chance you know how
to make me some priestly garb?

25:19.586 --> 25:22.589
I don't know if you heard,
but Angel Springs

25:22.589 --> 25:24.857
is in the need
of a new preacher.

25:24.957 --> 25:28.227
Well, any town
with a distillery,

25:28.327 --> 25:31.598
that's the Holy Land for
laying low in my good book.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.200
<i>They say blood
is always thicker.</i>

25:34.300 --> 25:36.803
<i>But for those of us
with no kin...</i>

25:38.304 --> 25:41.974
<i>...we'll take water,
whiskey, even tea.</i>

25:47.446 --> 25:49.348
<i>Gambling may seem
like an individual sport,</i>

25:49.448 --> 25:52.885
<i>but every move you make is tied
to the others playing the game.</i>

25:52.985 --> 25:54.486
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

25:54.621 --> 25:56.455
That's my fourth--
wait, no, fifth roll.

25:56.623 --> 25:57.857
Hey, what can I say?

25:57.957 --> 26:00.426
The sun shines a little brighter
on some of us.

26:00.526 --> 26:02.128
Ain't that right, big brother?

26:02.228 --> 26:04.030
You sure you're not
shaving those down?

26:04.130 --> 26:05.531
Maybe rounding the corners with
those cactus hands of yours?

26:05.632 --> 26:07.800
Yeah, who's cheating now?

26:07.900 --> 26:11.203
Trying to take
my throwing arm out, huh?

26:19.078 --> 26:20.913
What's the matter, Aunt T?
The meeting not go well?

26:21.013 --> 26:24.917
Let's just say Liam Collins has
sprouted himself a conscience.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.218
If he had a problem
with the plan,

26:26.318 --> 26:27.553
he should've told us weeks ago.

26:27.654 --> 26:30.156
- So what gives?
- Not what, who.

26:30.256 --> 26:33.860
He went and got married.
Brought her along with him.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.162
And she sounds like
a real church bell.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.264
Opinionated, high-minded.

26:38.364 --> 26:41.233
He said she made him want
to be a better husband.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.235
She does sound terrible.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.837
I don't like it.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.806
She could go and ruin everything,

26:46.906 --> 26:48.741
if she hasn't already.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.943
And he can't be trusted.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.980
You want to get rid of him?

26:57.149 --> 27:00.219
- All right.
- Ah, yeah, the missus, too.

27:00.987 --> 27:03.089
Why don't we just
ride out to Boston,

27:03.189 --> 27:05.725
- slaughter the whole family?
- Okay, yeah, we should.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.426
Oh, goodness, I don't know
about all that,

27:07.526 --> 27:11.030
but he's right about the girl.

27:13.733 --> 27:17.036
- Fetch me some soda water,
would you?
- All right.

27:20.807 --> 27:23.475
Oh, and some ice
would be nice, too.

27:23.575 --> 27:26.078
Yeah, sure thing, Aunt T.

27:28.547 --> 27:31.250
How are we gonna find somebody
to replace Collins?

27:31.350 --> 27:33.753
Well, you could go.

27:33.853 --> 27:37.289
I'm already sheriff
of Texarkana.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.025
Why don't you send Shane?
He would love it out there.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.260
Your brother couldn't find
his own behind

27:41.360 --> 27:43.996
if he had both his hands
in his back pockets.

27:44.096 --> 27:48.634
Besides, he's loyal
to that daddy of yours.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.236
You've been living
in a railroad town.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.238
You can work this
to our benefit.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.573
What's to work?
Independence, it's...

27:54.741 --> 27:57.376
Unkept, uncivilized. I know.

27:57.476 --> 28:00.747
That's why we were gonna send
that Collins boy, but...

28:00.847 --> 28:03.850
Independence could be
the first town

28:03.950 --> 28:06.518
we build from the ground up.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.156
We always knew this day
was gonna come.

28:10.256 --> 28:14.126
As long as that railroad keeps
barreling out west,

28:14.226 --> 28:16.295
so are we.

28:16.395 --> 28:20.199
Besides, it's time
you show that family of yours

28:20.299 --> 28:22.401
what you can do.

28:22.501 --> 28:26.105
Take your seat at the table
before that brother of yours

28:26.205 --> 28:29.675
comes along and steals it
right out from under you.

28:29.776 --> 28:32.311
And you don't have to like it.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.314
But you'll do it.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.449
For family.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.622
For family.

28:44.590 --> 28:47.193
I'm sorry, are you telling me
I can't take all my belongings?

28:47.293 --> 28:49.461
They won't fit in the wagon?
I have to leave things behind?

28:49.561 --> 28:52.799
Well, no. Some of them can.

28:52.799 --> 28:54.466
You just have to be real picky.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.869
Yeah, like you could take
a bunch of little things

28:56.969 --> 28:58.270
or just a few big things.

28:58.370 --> 29:02.041
Thank you,
that's-that's helpful, um...

29:02.141 --> 29:05.177
I'm sorry, I just need
a moment to decide.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.949
The-the trunk of clothes, please.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.518
Um, all the books, art supplies.

29:14.420 --> 29:18.624
<i>People change our lives
in ways we never expect.</i>

29:20.392 --> 29:23.095
<i>Sometimes they come along
before we ever knew</i>

29:23.195 --> 29:25.164
<i>they were there.</i>

29:31.570 --> 29:33.873
And the piano, please.

29:33.973 --> 29:36.642
Ma'am, are you sure?

29:36.742 --> 29:38.945
Th-This piano belonged
to my grandmother.

29:39.045 --> 29:40.146
We-we used to play it every day.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.448
Look, I've left
everything I know

29:42.548 --> 29:44.450
and everyone I love
to come here.

29:44.550 --> 29:47.854
This-- it's the last piece
I have of my family.

29:47.854 --> 29:49.555
The good parts of it, anyway.

29:49.655 --> 29:52.391
And I'll be damned if it's left
to rot here in the sun.

29:52.491 --> 29:55.361
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go find my husband.

30:20.887 --> 30:24.656
"I dream with my eyes open."

31:18.444 --> 31:22.214
Hello? Hello!

31:22.314 --> 31:24.650
Yes?

31:24.750 --> 31:26.252
Uh, I'm Abby.

31:26.352 --> 31:27.453
Abby Collins. I know.

31:27.553 --> 31:28.988
Our husbands spoke
back in Wichita.

31:29.088 --> 31:31.290
He's gonna be sheriff,
you're gonna be a schoolteacher.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.392
Yes, that's right.
Um, uh, perhaps you'd like

31:33.492 --> 31:35.294
- to sit down, and we can...
- No, thank you. I just came over

31:35.394 --> 31:37.997
to ask you to kindly
shut the hell up.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.798
Excuse me?

31:39.966 --> 31:41.433
For the past week I have
listened to you gripe

31:41.533 --> 31:44.971
about the heat, the rocks
in those fancy shoes,

31:45.071 --> 31:46.438
and you banging
on that damn piano

31:46.538 --> 31:48.040
all hours of the night.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.309
I'm terribly sorry to have
bothered you with the music.

31:50.409 --> 31:53.412
- I didn't think it mattered
out here.
- Why?

31:53.512 --> 31:55.247
'Cause people like us
don't matter?

31:55.347 --> 31:58.217
That's not what I said.

31:58.317 --> 32:01.820
I may not have fancy frocks
or the art,

32:01.988 --> 32:04.090
but you'll see that
none of that matters out here.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.258
All that matters is family.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.427
Now, if you don't mind...

32:08.527 --> 32:10.062
Hey, are you all right?

32:10.162 --> 32:12.364
Something's wrong.

32:17.003 --> 32:19.805
I have some dresses for cloth.
We need water now.

32:19.905 --> 32:21.573
And for God's sake,
get this woman some shade!

32:21.673 --> 32:22.874
I'll be right back, sweetheart.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.877
I can't pay for those dresses.

32:26.012 --> 32:27.379
I don't want your money.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.348
Despite what you may
think of me,

32:29.448 --> 32:33.852
we're women, and in a way
that makes us family.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.187
You got any kids?

32:36.388 --> 32:39.591
Uh, the, the family I have,

32:39.691 --> 32:41.127
I didn't think it was right.

32:41.227 --> 32:44.263
Then I met my husband,
and he reinspired my faith.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.632
He's your people.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.035
I lied earlier.

32:49.035 --> 32:52.238
Your song, it's beautiful.

32:53.605 --> 32:56.442
I hope you get
to finish it one day.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.711
Okay.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.413
<i>There's a moment
that happens to us</i>

33:01.513 --> 33:02.681
<i>out on the frontier...</i>

33:04.050 --> 33:05.684
<i>...when you realize
all you have is</i>

33:05.784 --> 33:08.920
<i>the sky over our heads
and the dirt at our feet.</i>

33:09.055 --> 33:11.423
<i>To make a new world
for ourselves,</i>

33:11.523 --> 33:13.559
<i>we have to let the old fall away</i>

33:13.659 --> 33:15.561
<i>if we're to survive.</i>

33:15.661 --> 33:18.564
<i>Guess you can say
it's like being born anew.</i>

33:27.806 --> 33:28.740
Sam.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.079
Sam, what's wrong?

33:33.079 --> 33:35.147
Where's Eliza?

33:35.247 --> 33:37.449
She started bleeding
in the middle of the night.

33:37.549 --> 33:41.187
Before I could do
anything to help, she was gone.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.994
- I'm so sorry.
- I don't know what to do.

33:55.934 --> 33:56.768
Will you take her?

33:56.868 --> 33:58.904
She deserves a better life

33:59.004 --> 34:00.472
than I could give her.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.944
All this child needs...

34:06.112 --> 34:07.846
is a loving father.

34:08.947 --> 34:10.716
Sam, I...

34:10.816 --> 34:13.252
I know you're scared.

34:13.352 --> 34:14.653
This frontier does that to you.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.888
It pushes you beyond
your limits.

34:16.988 --> 34:20.859
But that is when
you have to hold on.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.396
Because on the other side
of that fear

34:24.496 --> 34:26.565
is knowing just
how strong you are,

34:26.665 --> 34:29.835
and a life more beautiful

34:29.935 --> 34:34.473
than you could possibly imagine.

34:36.041 --> 34:38.144
We decided to name her Abigail.

34:38.144 --> 34:42.748
You can come visit her
anytime in Austin.

34:48.620 --> 34:49.855
May I?

35:00.232 --> 35:03.635
<i>They say you're the author
of your own story.</i>

35:03.735 --> 35:05.271
<i>At any time, you can choose</i>

35:05.371 --> 35:08.907
<i>to write something different
for yourself, but...</i>

35:09.007 --> 35:10.809
<i>...changing your story</i>

35:10.909 --> 35:14.079
<i>isn't as easy as it sounds.</i>

35:15.080 --> 35:17.015
Hey, big brother.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.455
Shane, what the...?

35:23.555 --> 35:24.756
What are you doing here?

35:24.856 --> 35:26.192
Well, Aunt Teresa sent me.

35:26.192 --> 35:28.327
Wanted to make sure
the job got done.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.496
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

35:30.596 --> 35:33.199
So, is it done?

35:33.299 --> 35:35.601
No, it's not.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.605
It's been a week.

35:39.705 --> 35:40.872
What have you been
doing out here?

35:40.972 --> 35:44.843
Waiting for the right moment.

35:44.943 --> 35:49.415
Oh, all right, well,
just know that if you can't,

35:49.515 --> 35:50.982
I'm here to help.

35:51.082 --> 35:54.353
Hey, that's what brothers
are for.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.759
Now, I was thinking...

36:02.828 --> 36:04.930
...maybe we could just
take out Liam.

36:05.030 --> 36:08.467
Then walk off alone, make it
look like an Indian attack.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.902
That way there's fewer
questions, no witnesses.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.971
It's actually smarter that way.

36:15.006 --> 36:18.810
I can't decide
what's more pathetic--

36:18.910 --> 36:20.846
you falling for a woman
that you've never met

36:20.946 --> 36:22.714
or you falling for a woman
you're supposed to kill.

36:22.814 --> 36:23.782
No, I knew
you wouldn't understand.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.251
You don't think ahead.

36:25.251 --> 36:26.485
You're like an ant,
you just keep pushing

36:26.585 --> 36:27.919
what's in front of you.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.855
Okay, well, I may not
understand the mastermind

36:29.955 --> 36:32.991
that is Tom Davidson,
but I also don't forget.

36:33.091 --> 36:34.460
This is just like Rosalin.

36:36.662 --> 36:37.929
You don't say her name.

36:38.029 --> 36:41.867
Forbidden love.
That's your type.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.535
It didn't have to be forbidden.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.405
Father just didn't approve
of her because she was poor,

36:46.505 --> 36:48.807
so he drove her away.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.376
Made her whole family disappear.

36:50.476 --> 36:51.710
It was for your own good, Tommy.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.345
For my own good?
What does that mean?

36:53.445 --> 36:56.014
She was trying to get her hooks
into you and our money.

36:56.114 --> 36:58.417
What the hell
are you talking about?

36:58.517 --> 37:00.752
What does that mean?

37:02.087 --> 37:04.756
Okay, look, it...
it was 15 years ago.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.025
Okay, who knows? Who cares?

37:07.125 --> 37:09.928
But you need to forget about her
and this Collins woman.

37:10.028 --> 37:11.397
She's just a job.

37:11.497 --> 37:14.400
You don't just forget
someone like her.

37:16.201 --> 37:18.404
And she is not just a job.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.975
There's something about her.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.630
Shane, hey, what are you doing?

37:45.130 --> 37:47.599
Shane. Shane, stop!

37:47.699 --> 37:48.734
Stop!

<i>It's been said the roots

38:33.812 --> 38:35.381

38:35.481 --> 38:36.915
All right.
No crying this time.
