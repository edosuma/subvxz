Don't do anything stupid.

Don't do anything stupid.

00:17.320 --> 00:18.240
Get over there!

00:18.320 --> 00:19.560
You wanna die today? Huh?

00:19.640 --> 00:21.680
Do you wanna die?

00:29.240 --> 00:30.080
The rules are simple.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.440
You look up, you die.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.400
You move, you die.

00:33.480 --> 00:36.160
You even think about
leaving this room, you die.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.920
We're all clear out here!

00:38.000 --> 00:39.240

Go!

01:00.120 --> 01:01.080
Come on, now.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.320
Where is the security guard?

01:03.400 --> 01:04.120
I don't know.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.160
Go!

01:05.240 --> 01:05.920

Put your head down!

01:14.160 --> 01:15.360
Don't look at me
or I'll blow it off!

01:15.440 --> 01:16.960
Do you understand me?

01:17.040 --> 01:18.640
I'm trying not
to think about it.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.280
It's ok to experience sorrow
or even guilt.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.000
Look, you lost your father
in the line of duty

01:24.080 --> 01:27.440
and now your partner, that's
a lot for you to process.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.120
What do you want me to say?

01:29.200 --> 01:31.840
I have no agenda here except
to support you, Kate.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.200
Come on.

01:33.280 --> 01:35.800
You're only gonna be happy
if I cry.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.320
Is that what you're afraid of?

01:37.400 --> 01:40.320
You ask a lot of questions.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.280
Kate, you are what we call
"well-defended".

01:47.640 --> 01:49.080
How about working
with Detective Wells?

01:49.160 --> 01:50.760
You've shared very little.
How's that going?

01:50.840 --> 01:53.920
He's well-defended.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.760
So what do you talk about?

01:55.840 --> 01:58.200
Outside of business, I mean.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.760
Does he know your mother's
running for mayor?

02:04.840 --> 02:06.880
Oh god, don't even get me
started about that.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.400
Now she's on me to appear at her
fundraisers and media events.

02:10.480 --> 02:12.640
Well, maybe she's inviting you
to share in something

02:12.720 --> 02:15.680
that matters to her.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.200
You know what matters
to me?

02:18.280 --> 02:21.800
Not speeches or photo ops
or kissing babies.

He shot me!

Why was she chosen
to help?

05:27.840 --> 05:32.400
They needed a teller
and singled her out, I guess.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.360
I was too scared to look up.
She must have.

05:35.440 --> 05:37.640

the security guard?

Stan has rounds that he does.

Uh... I was on the floor.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.200
We all were.

06:15.280 --> 06:18.440
And I saw the gun land outside the door.

He had the money,
grabbed the gun and fired.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.120
At the bank teller?

I didn't see.

I just ran at him.

I tackled him.

He dropped it.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.720
We were both fighting for it

he bolted.

alarm was triggered

thought it was a false alert.

to call the bank

09:31.720 --> 09:33.600
Tech crime's pulling footage
from all the cameras

09:33.680 --> 09:34.880
in the area.

09:34.960 --> 09:35.800
We're reviewing the bank
security footage

09:35.880 --> 09:36.880
from the weeks prior.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.120
It was obviously well-planned.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.880
I talked to Paul
in guns and gangs,

09:39.960 --> 09:41.400
asked him to keep his ears
open for any talk on the street.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.680
Yeah, I'm not sure that'll
be of much help.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.720
How soon can we question
the teller, Teresa Risen?

09:48.800 --> 09:50.360
Doctors can't say.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.480
What I can't figure out
is why they shot her.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.480
By all accounts she did
everything that was asked.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.200
Maybe she recognized
one of them.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.560
They knew exactly
when to hit the place.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.320
They had to have been
there before.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.560
Chatting up the young teller,
asking her about business?

10:01.640 --> 10:03.520
If they were good she'd have
no idea they were playing her.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.040
Let's dig into
the teller's life.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.280
See if there's anything
to this.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.000
You and I need to have
a chat.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.240
Come on.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.520
What's with Nolan
and guns and gangs?

10:17.600 --> 10:20.960
It's a common affliction
known as SDS.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.440
Swinging Dick Syndrome.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.240

10:31.560 --> 10:33.080
No casualties, that was
the agreement.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.400
We got a bigger problem.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.640
My gun was left behind
at the bank.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.320

10:41.400 --> 10:42.240
Chill out, man.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.400

10:43.480 --> 10:44.960

10:45.040 --> 10:46.880
I'm just making sure
our money's safe.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.880
Stick to the plan.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.360
That's all we've got now.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.440
You know, you worry too much.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.480
I hit every camera.
There's no tape.

10:58.560 --> 10:59.520
Pay attention.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.920
My prints are on the gun, moron.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.640

the guy who can I.D. you.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.200

Yes.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.200
Detective Jameson.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.440
I understand Teresa
is still unconscious.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.400
Yes, it's quite a shock,
all of this.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.560
You're Teresa's emergency
contact.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.080
She's an active member
of my church.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.920
One of our volunteers.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.400
Lovely girl.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.080
Does she have any family
that you know of?

11:48.160 --> 11:50.000
A boyfriend, a girlfriend?

11:50.080 --> 11:51.200
Her family's back east.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.960
They're quite close.

11:53.040 --> 11:57.720
She broke off an engagement
and came out here to start over.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.400
Anything unusual about
her behaviour recently?

12:00.480 --> 12:02.200
What does this have to do
with her being shot?

12:02.280 --> 12:04.240
We have to be thorough.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.320
Well, I wouldn't call
this unusual,

12:06.400 --> 12:09.880
but she has been attending
services more regularly.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.600
Maybe something was weighing
on her conscience?

12:12.680 --> 12:15.480
I can't imagine the things
that you see, Detective,

12:15.560 --> 12:19.800
but I'd like to think she wanted
a closer relationship to God.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.880
How long has he been here?

12:23.720 --> 12:26.880
A couple of hours.
He came straight from the bank.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.680
Poor man's having a hard time.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.680
He keeps asking if I think
she's gonna make it.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.520
Teresa's two months behind
on her rent.

12:56.680 --> 12:57.840
I'm with him.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.440

She's broke.

13:45.760 --> 13:49.440
Desperate to keep her head
above water, I'm sure.

No.

Hey.

She's a novelist.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.960
"Sinners and Saints".

14:11.800 --> 14:14.280
It's about a European heist.

14:14.360 --> 14:15.960
She was in on it.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.280
Teresa's brother says
she hasn't been in contact

14:20.360 --> 14:21.960
with the family in two years.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.800
Yet her pastor was under
the impression they were close.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.560
Girl likes to tell her stories.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.520
She borrowed $5,000 from her
parents for an apartment rental

14:27.600 --> 14:30.080
then used it to travel to Europe
to write a novel.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.600
About a jewellery heist,
not a bank robbery.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.760
That explains the unpaid
bills and debt.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.800
We have her phone records?

14:35.880 --> 14:37.200
I'm still waiting on them.

14:37.280 --> 14:40.600
Her computer's with tech crime.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.080
I'll finish the rest of this.

22:58.040 --> 23:01.240
We didn't steal anything.

Well, I've gotta commend you,
the job was well-planned.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.400
Impressive, actually.

it was a mistake.

left behind at the crime scene.

23:19.880 --> 23:23.640

is to return the money.

to Teresa?

24:12.920 --> 24:15.000
I want a lawyer.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.840
You were pretty much out the
door with a million dollars.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.560
Why shoot her?

24:18.640 --> 24:20.320
Was it to cut her out?

24:20.400 --> 24:23.720

I want a lawyer!

Steve admitted it was Teresa's
idea but then he clammed up

24:40.960 --> 24:42.200
and asked for a lawyer.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.800
She's still in ICU?

24:43.880 --> 24:46.720
Yeah, we're hoping to talk
to her in the morning.

the autopsy on Stanley Morris,

he might have something.

to eat in here?

24:58.880 --> 25:00.240
Why would it?

25:00.320 --> 25:02.320
Uh, you- you found something
in the autopsy?

25:02.400 --> 25:03.880
Pretty straight forward,

25:03.960 --> 25:05.160
two gun shots to the chest
collapsed his lungs.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.680
But I thought they-

25:06.760 --> 25:07.560
The victim in the hospital
is another story.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.240
I saw the police report,

25:09.320 --> 25:10.560
it doesn't match the emergency
clinician's assessment

25:10.640 --> 25:12.280
of the wound.

25:12.360 --> 25:14.000
The width of the abrasion
caused from the bullet entry

25:14.080 --> 25:15.680
suggests that Teresa's shooter
was a few feet in front of her,

25:15.760 --> 25:17.800
not 30 feet away as reported.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.880
Witness got the distance wrong,
it happens all the time.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.240
Wait, you're saying the shooter
was standing

25:21.320 --> 25:22.360
right in front of her?

25:22.440 --> 25:24.120
Directly.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.280
Someone fires a gun that close,
I'd say it was an execution.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.040
I mean, Ryan seemed pretty
certain where the shooter was.

right in the face,

25:31.560 --> 25:33.560

it gets interesting.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.240
They knew each other.

Ok, so if Teresa's the insider
and the brothers are the muscle,

25:57.560 --> 25:59.040
