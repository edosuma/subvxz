Luther.

02:21.955 --> 02:23.955
Luther.

02:27.993 --> 02:30.275
Where is this guy?

02:47.579 --> 02:49.658
Are you ready?
- If.

02:51.686 --> 02:54.249
You nervous.
- No, Dad.

02:54.714 --> 02:58.773
If you lie, your nose will grow.
- It will not.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.179
When you feel nervous,
remember what I said.

03:02.279 --> 03:04.895
Close your eyes and make
realize you're there.

03:04.995 --> 03:06.995
Right.

03:09.403 --> 03:11.403
What is this?

03:13.823 --> 03:16.545
I wanted to show my friends.

03:17.745 --> 03:20.762
We are all very proud,
reverend. Very proud.

03:20.862 --> 03:24.075
Come on, Luther.
- Come on.

03:30.114 --> 03:32.114
Farewell to all.

03:34.321 --> 03:36.568
God bless.

03:43.621 --> 03:45.621
What is it?
- Nothing.

03:46.382 --> 03:48.852
Come on, tell me you have.

03:53.301 --> 03:57.041
Why did you kill her?
- Because I was scared.

06:08.165 --> 06:10.165
Mama.

06:13.697 --> 06:16.117
Do you believe God created
heaven and earth...

06:16.217 --> 06:18.047
...and populated the world... </ i>...

06:18.147 --> 06:23.247
...without a specific purpose?
If so, you are wrong. </ I>...

06:25.154 --> 06:28.469
...We were made to live apart. </ I>...

06:29.009 --> 06:31.309
What?
- Changed the channel.

06:35.498 --> 06:37.498
Outside.

06:40.202 --> 06:45.047
I forbid you see that guy in
front of your brothers, Owen.

06:45.493 --> 06:47.969
What will you do today?

06:48.407 --> 06:51.465
Riding Underwear drinking beer?

06:54.107 --> 06:56.154
There is a place in the canteen.

06:56.254 --> 06:58.109
I'm not flipping burgers.

06:58.209 --> 07:01.238
Need your help.
Are also part of this family.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.898
Call this family.?

08:03.441 --> 08:06.340
Good day.
How are you, Margo?

08:06.757 --> 08:10.397
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.
I tried to call but you were out.

08:10.497 --> 08:13.387
What is it?
Tell me.

08:16.024 --> 08:19.063
BLACK DIE.

08:19.615 --> 08:24.375
If you are going to get names, at least
could write well.

08:31.477 --> 08:34.217
We will continue.

08:54.421 --> 08:59.139
Never miss sacred oath.

08:59.857 --> 09:05.127
To join us, you're missing
and government favoritism towards...

09:05.206 --> 09:08.011
Blacks.
Sentences yellow hordes...

09:08.218 --> 09:12.468
...and the crowds of Latinos
invade our own shores.

09:12.599 --> 09:19.357
Y complaints
dirty money vile Jewish bankers.

09:20.089 --> 09:23.424
Never betray your white brothers.

09:23.839 --> 09:28.480
Never rest until we obtain our Aryan Nation,

09:28.891 --> 09:33.376
under one God as one race pristine.

09:33.831 --> 09:37.667
While contaminated slag there between us,

09:38.262 --> 09:41.832
hatred is our law and our mission revenge.

09:42.198 --> 09:46.800
Owen Tucker,
what do you say?

09:47.254 --> 09:51.366
Patriots let me join their ranks.

10:12.105 --> 10:18.204
Now you have a home.
And you are welcome.

10:24.531 --> 10:29.883
White Power.
White Power.

10:35.107 --> 10:37.376
Well, calm down.

10:37.962 --> 10:41.154
Davey, Mikey,
Behave.

10:44.635 --> 10:48.970
For today's meeting,
I have a very special surprise.

10:49.143 --> 10:54.555
Under the direction of
Miss Elizabeth Jackson...

10:54.655 --> 10:56.071
,

10:56.171 --> 10:59.536
please receive the vocal group
that was state champion...

10:59.636 --> 11:00.636
...

11:00.736 --> 11:03.513
Liberty Baptist Choir.

11:36.901 --> 11:42.137
Brothers, today we have something special
.

11:53.867 --> 11:57.662
Reverend Phelps.
Good to see.

11:59.871 --> 12:04.304
Before a black
knew the meaning of a cross on fire.

12:07.696 --> 12:12.814
Killing me will not shut up the truth.

12:13.405 --> 12:16.208
No, no, Reverend, nobody said
anything about killing...

12:16.308 --> 12:17.308
.

12:17.408 --> 12:20.313
I just want to read the newspaper.

12:20.950 --> 12:24.107
It's amazing what one can find. Like today.

12:24.207 --> 12:27.294
Luther Reverend Phelps father,

12:27.767 --> 12:30.639
Liberty Baptist preacher,

12:31.085 --> 12:33.890
used his pulpit to attack racial,

12:37.053 --> 12:40.028
blah, blah, blah,
lots of chatter...

12:40.302 --> 12:43.726
Here follows.
And I quote:

12:44.516 --> 12:50.303
Earth
Aria has attracted radical racists, </ i>...

12:50.854 --> 12:51.854
......

12:51.954 --> 12:56.280
...are here just to spread
their message of hate. </ I>...

12:56.380 --> 12:59.560
...says Phelps called these groups...

12:59.924 --> 13:02.587
A scourge of the earth.

13:03.357 --> 13:05.357
Spank?

13:07.834 --> 13:10.677
Strong words, right?

13:14.136 --> 13:19.216
Tell me, have you ever played to baseball?

13:20.671 --> 13:22.671
Surely if.

13:24.426 --> 13:28.654
Abner Doubleday,
a white,

13:29.119 --> 13:32.731
invented baseball...

13:33.283 --> 13:38.794
For people to learn coordination...

13:40.506 --> 13:43.651
...and to keep your eyes on the ball.

13:52.721 --> 13:55.465
Reverend, I invited today...

13:56.718 --> 14:01.674
...
promoting some computer game.

14:02.333 --> 14:05.790
You have to have some respect...

14:06.270 --> 14:10.010
On the other team.
Do you understand?

14:10.340 --> 14:13.763
What I mean, black?.

14:14.125 --> 14:17.753
Respect applies to everyone,

14:18.190 --> 14:21.123
or not true for anyone.

14:21.599 --> 14:25.129
God does not judge us by
the color of our skin...

14:25.229 --> 14:26.478
.

14:26.578 --> 14:29.405
Take that as a 'yes.'

14:30.286 --> 14:35.151
Reverend, I'm glad we had this talk,

14:35.606 --> 14:40.666
and could share his wisdom with us
black, white trash.

14:41.212 --> 14:45.890
Go.

14:46.437 --> 14:49.393
Go and take care, okay?

14:49.831 --> 14:53.886
Come on, no kidding.
Go.

14:56.911 --> 15:00.266
Damn, I forgot something, Reverend.

16:01.890 --> 16:06.509
Make
a message to all those who oppose us.

16:06.969 --> 16:10.439
No longer we will be a silent majority.

16:11.001 --> 16:15.828
This is the land of the white man.

16:16.346 --> 16:21.210
Blacks will not be tolerated.

16:21.809 --> 16:25.154
What do they say?
- White Power.

16:25.545 --> 16:31.307
White Power.
White Power.

19:15.145 --> 19:17.869
Sorry, does a payphone?

19:18.393 --> 19:21.708
At the side of the men's room.
- Thanks.

19:53.633 --> 19:55.633
Thank you, Georgia.

19:59.184 --> 20:01.184
A bat.

20:19.584 --> 20:21.647
Problem, honey?

20:23.473 --> 20:26.108
You're hurting me.
- He's right.

20:27.432 --> 20:31.002
Misconduct had not.
Do not hurt you, right?

20:31.470 --> 20:34.909
Miss, could you give me a cup of coffee?

20:44.386 --> 20:46.447
Does not seem right.

20:47.492 --> 20:49.492
Maybe it's friendly.

20:51.342 --> 20:55.239
Best show him what kind of
can be friends, right?

20:55.339 --> 20:57.439
Free.
- Are you sure?

21:00.428 --> 21:02.428
Thanks.

21:03.106 --> 21:05.585
Hello, how are you?
- What?

21:05.975 --> 21:10.748
're Not from around here or
you meet. Are you passing through?

21:10.848 --> 21:13.653
Yes, sorry...
- I'm Donnie Hensen.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.067
How is? Tommy Lee.
- Lee?

21:20.618 --> 21:23.572
Is a good southern name,

21:23.962 --> 21:26.710
as the Confederation
General Robert E. Lee.

21:26.810 --> 21:28.810
Is it related?

21:33.246 --> 21:35.304
A taste, sorry.

21:35.871 --> 21:37.615
Where are you going?

21:37.715 --> 21:39.715
Maybe we can catch up.

21:41.962 --> 21:44.597
It's fine.
- Are you sure?

21:46.580 --> 21:48.580
If.
- Agreed.

21:57.876 --> 21:59.876
VolverÃ¡s.

22:13.494 --> 22:17.319
MISSING Reverend Luther
Phelps, father. </ I>.

22:17.940 --> 22:19.940
By God.

22:37.352 --> 22:41.298
Problem, Officer?
- If.

22:41.841 --> 22:45.425
're Late...
And you walk.

22:45.986 --> 22:49.510
I got your message.
- Good to see you, Jack.

22:49.610 --> 22:51.343
Good thing see me.

22:51.443 --> 22:56.713
How are you? Dejame.
- No, I will send a tow truck for the car.

22:57.005 --> 23:00.674
Susan takes all week waiting.
Cooked everything you bought.

23:00.774 --> 23:05.194
Cooking? - Is improving.
- You can not get any worse.

23:18.900 --> 23:20.900
What happened?

23:21.267 --> 23:24.157
Liberty is not what it was, Tommy.

23:33.339 --> 23:37.765
Come on, Luther...
should have been able to grab easily.

23:37.865 --> 23:39.905
Justin, I said 'enough'.

23:40.547 --> 23:45.562
Do not want to do anything, Mom.
- It may not feel like it..

23:53.608 --> 23:56.856
Look who came.
- Come, Luther.

23:58.321 --> 24:00.321
Look what I found.

24:01.604 --> 24:03.395
Tommy?

24:03.495 --> 24:05.495
Sister.

24:07.538 --> 24:09.431
I can not believe you're here. Let me see.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.940
Hello, Uncle Tommy.
- Justin.

24:12.703 --> 24:15.379
Wow, look at you.

24:17.519 --> 24:19.585
Come on, take them out.

24:24.370 --> 24:26.370
Is faster.

24:26.885 --> 24:30.795
Tommy, remember to Luther?
- Sure. How are you?

24:33.417 --> 24:36.385
You know when I saw you last? -No.

24:36.768 --> 24:40.522
You were so small.
How are you, Luther?

24:40.910 --> 24:43.333
I guess.
- Are you hungry?

24:43.708 --> 24:46.938
If.
- Well. There are liver and onions.

25:15.908 --> 25:18.555
Our cities became war zones.

25:18.692 --> 25:23.995
The streets in our neighborhood are
filled with children's charities..

25:24.095 --> 25:28.033
They stole our jobs and
were given to immigrants,

25:28.133 --> 25:31.930
Zionist and this government does not care.

25:32.598 --> 25:37.018
Unless, of course, that just
arrive into the country.

25:40.643 --> 25:44.521
But to us, the Church of the
Crusade Aria, if we care.

25:44.621 --> 25:48.630
And so we came to help.

25:49.811 --> 25:53.556
Expanding Aria Earth is our future.

25:54.276 --> 25:57.591
With our work we create our own nation,

25:57.713 --> 26:00.596
with God, justice and
freedom for our children...

26:00.696 --> 26:03.586
..... and our children's children.

26:10.344 --> 26:12.783
Count on your commitment.

26:13.340 --> 26:17.050
I know I can rely on your dedication,

26:17.533 --> 26:21.893
because we all have the same ultimate goal
.

26:55.722 --> 26:58.527
Where have you been?
- Over there.

27:15.358 --> 27:17.801
What are you doing?
- I'm going.

27:17.901 --> 27:20.876
Go back and talk to me,
Owen Tucker.

27:22.532 --> 27:24.532
Look at me.

27:29.895 --> 27:31.895
Good God...

27:33.008 --> 27:37.683
If your father were here -
- Not. You took care of that.

27:40.918 --> 27:45.951
Owen, please. You know what that
people are doing to the people.

27:46.051 --> 27:50.776
We fight for our race.
- No, the demerit.

27:51.728 --> 27:56.443
One of them attacked me today.
- What?

27:59.048 --> 28:01.475
You probably deserved it.

28:07.807 --> 28:11.727
Not brought you into this
world that go around...

28:11.827 --> 28:13.827
...choking people.

28:13.953 --> 28:16.928
To what brought me into this world?

28:19.725 --> 28:21.725
Owen.

28:22.457 --> 28:24.560
Owene Tucker.

28:25.444 --> 28:28.674
Hatred gives me something to live for.

28:33.576 --> 28:36.160
Hate will get you killed.

28:38.295 --> 28:41.269
Hatred will kill you.

28:54.859 --> 28:59.764
Why not arrest him?
- There were no witnesses.

28:59.864 --> 29:03.604
Ni corpse. So no case.
- But suppose who was?

29:04.190 --> 29:06.190
Si.

29:06.529 --> 29:11.043
And Luther?
- Is living with us.

29:12.311 --> 29:17.067
Do not know what it is.
See it every day and give you hope,

29:17.167 --> 29:19.167
when there is no.

29:26.784 --> 29:30.049
I'll bring the kids to find ice cream.
Will you come?

29:30.149 --> 29:33.501
No, go.
- Come on, Uncle Tommy.

29:34.258 --> 29:37.735
Well.
Just had to buy some things.

29:38.214 --> 29:41.954
Do not you want chocolate?
- Do not tempt me.

30:01.978 --> 30:03.978
Come on, guys.

30:07.166 --> 30:10.736
Where is the store? - There.
- Now we come.

30:12.358 --> 30:15.002
Guys, just a taste.

30:43.539 --> 30:45.539
Get down.

30:46.992 --> 30:49.202
Out of here, yellow whore.

30:49.387 --> 30:52.395
One.. two...

30:55.463 --> 30:57.697
I'm coming, I'm coming.

31:09.429 --> 31:11.554
Back to where you belong.

31:11.673 --> 31:14.148
Tommy.
- Karen.

31:16.366 --> 31:17.366
Go.

31:17.466 --> 31:21.461
The Chinese are multiplying
like rabbits. Come.

31:21.567 --> 31:23.580
Look what we have here.

31:27.311 --> 31:31.110
Look, I do not want problems.

31:32.196 --> 31:38.100
You're far from home, boy.
- Do not have to do this. We're leaving.

31:38.580 --> 31:40.580
Yes, they will.

31:49.889 --> 31:54.904
That nice guy. Very pretty.
- I said I did not want trouble.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.550
I broke my nose,
motherfucker.

32:36.749 --> 32:38.981
Let, larguÃ©mosnos.

32:41.617 --> 32:44.914
You all right?
- I'm fine. It's over.

32:55.629 --> 32:57.629
Karen.

32:57.759 --> 33:00.351
Dad.
- Justin, okay?

33:01.820 --> 33:05.374
Let us children home now.

33:25.726 --> 33:27.936
Did you see anything?
- No.

33:28.304 --> 33:31.174
Come on, do anything?

33:32.321 --> 33:35.965
Mr. Morgan?
- Commissioner...

33:36.438 --> 33:38.644
Is he saw something.

33:39.927 --> 33:43.333
I have a wife and two children.
- So nobody knows how...

33:43.433 --> 33:45.553
...how I feel.

34:01.189 --> 34:05.290
What a day, eh? How are you?
- Well.

34:08.445 --> 34:11.746
It's okay to be afraid sometimes.

34:14.333 --> 34:18.246
We called 'crusaders'.
What does it mean?

34:20.210 --> 34:22.532
Means you are ignorant.

34:24.094 --> 34:28.746
Sorry I was not there.
- You can not be everywhere.

34:30.078 --> 34:32.078
're Right.

34:33.781 --> 34:37.690
You know how I love you, right?
Do you know it?

34:38.128 --> 34:41.790
I promise this will not happen again.

34:42.268 --> 34:46.085
Okay, Dad.
- Will not happen again.

34:46.801 --> 34:48.801
I promise.

34:56.304 --> 34:58.388
This child is a beauty.

34:59.578 --> 35:02.992
Is female
- What? - Female.

35:04.372 --> 35:06.372
I'm sorry, baby.

35:06.735 --> 35:09.795
Justin, it's time. Go to freshen up.

35:09.952 --> 35:13.522
See you later, Uncle Tommy.
- See you, boy.

35:15.874 --> 35:19.025
Missed you.
As everyone.

35:20.033 --> 35:22.107
I missed you too.

35:22.596 --> 35:25.741
Wants to teach him to defend himself.

35:27.233 --> 35:31.294
Karen, you know no longer teach.

35:34.398 --> 35:38.133
I'm sorry.
Yes?

35:39.363 --> 35:43.412
Help me to upload and go.
- Where?

35:44.085 --> 35:47.365
At the Four H's fair.
- The Four H's?

35:47.859 --> 35:51.743
You volunteer.
- Really?

35:52.713 --> 35:54.713
Come on, come on.

35:54.890 --> 35:56.890
Shoots and... FAIL.

36:01.540 --> 36:05.655
What is it, boy?
Do not eat?

36:06.157 --> 36:08.919
Strip harder.
Do not be lazy.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.628
Strike 2.

36:15.143 --> 36:17.799
Do the best you can do, boy?

36:18.275 --> 36:20.275
Strips as a child.

36:20.540 --> 36:23.937
Wait a moment. David, I'll buy the shot
for $ 5.

36:24.037 --> 36:26.409
$ 5?
Great.

36:26.867 --> 36:29.813
Ma'am, what does?
It's the shot of the child.

36:29.913 --> 36:31.721

36:31.821 --> 36:34.618

37:16.596 --> 37:21.526

37:21.870 --> 37:24.581
Get out you.
Is public land.

37:25.007 --> 37:28.391
Owen?
Owen Tucker?

37:29.448 --> 37:34.206
Do not teach to hate here.
- Is not hate, it's true.

37:34.634 --> 37:37.291
And you're not my teacher.

37:40.289 --> 37:43.240
Give me that.
- Get your hands off me.

37:43.340 --> 37:44.984
Come, let us go from here.

37:45.084 --> 37:47.653
Why do not you go home, baby?

37:57.643 --> 38:02.403
Who the hell are you, boy?
- I called the Clown Murderer.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.864
Hold him.

38:41.757 --> 38:43.757
Do not, child.

38:58.277 --> 39:00.277
Shit.

39:15.930 --> 39:19.035
Come on, Chinaman.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.666
Yellow Bastard. I have Do not fear.

39:27.470 --> 39:29.470
Shit.

39:30.949 --> 39:33.029
After finish this.

39:36.789 --> 39:40.330
That was not necessary.
I can take care of myself.

39:40.430 --> 39:43.171
How?
- Almost kills him.

39:43.995 --> 39:48.253
Lady.... Welcome.

40:01.504 --> 40:05.815
Wow, it double what we discussed.

40:06.577 --> 40:10.624
Is military equipment.
Very expensive.

40:12.670 --> 40:17.054
But for being you, I will give it.

40:20.907 --> 40:22.978
Is comfortable.

40:23.973 --> 40:26.047
Good.
Try it.

40:27.011 --> 40:29.011
Go.

40:49.110 --> 40:52.522
I hate blind dates.
- Not a blind date.

40:53.026 --> 40:56.100
Justin is the teacher.
- I know my sister.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.200
I arrived.

41:01.034 --> 41:03.703
What do you think?
- Jesus...

41:04.839 --> 41:07.192
The Ice Queen?

41:59.267 --> 42:02.354
I think you missed a spot.
- Where?

42:05.467 --> 42:07.762
I do everything thoroughly.

42:10.014 --> 42:12.014
Know...

42:13.200 --> 42:17.030
I wanted to apologize for being such a bitch
yesterday.

42:17.130 --> 42:20.790
What a strong word.
Appropriate, but strong.

42:20.977 --> 42:23.360
Tried to thank your help.

42:23.756 --> 42:26.221
No, you were right.
All right.

42:27.011 --> 42:28.786
About what?

42:28.886 --> 42:31.224
Should have let you hit.

42:33.109 --> 42:35.149
Strong character, right?

42:36.623 --> 42:39.513
Tell me something, Margo...
- What?

42:39.830 --> 42:42.591
Are you always this rude?
- If.

42:43.144 --> 42:45.674
Do not why you committed?

42:46.730 --> 42:49.668
I'm engaged.

42:51.597 --> 42:53.597
With it...

42:55.115 --> 42:57.115
Going to pay.

43:08.141 --> 43:12.270
Tommy.
Come here please. </ I>.

43:24.906 --> 43:26.906
What is this?

43:27.697 --> 43:29.697
Metelli inside.

43:32.830 --> 43:36.145
Have five seconds to leave my property.

43:36.287 --> 43:38.287
Four...

43:38.560 --> 43:40.560
...Three...

43:41.264 --> 43:43.264
...Two...

43:43.340 --> 43:46.098
Right.
White Power.

43:57.919 --> 43:59.919
Luther is.

43:59.996 --> 44:02.004
How?
- I'll get it..

44:02.360 --> 44:04.995
I think where he was.
- Come on.

44:06.107 --> 44:08.657
Come on, Jack.
Enter the house.

44:45.564 --> 44:47.564
Luther?

44:53.621 --> 44:55.621
Are you okay?

44:55.808 --> 44:58.930
They are the ones who killed my dad.

44:59.339 --> 45:02.569
How do you know?
- I've seen it before.

45:02.654 --> 45:07.346
Burned a cross and... took him away.

45:07.847 --> 45:12.983
I did not do anything.
Why do they hate me?

45:14.456 --> 45:19.386
Luther, I'll tell you something
and I want you to listen...

45:19.453 --> 45:21.059
.

45:21.159 --> 45:26.880
Do not hate you.
Hate all those who are different from them.

45:27.448 --> 45:31.372
My dad told me he wanted them all.
I can not help it.

45:31.472 --> 45:33.472
Hate them.

45:33.660 --> 45:38.243
You can not fight hate with hate
. You consume.

45:38.676 --> 45:42.161
Would you feel if you killed your father?

45:46.721 --> 45:48.721
Not know, Luther.

45:50.021 --> 45:52.494
I want her back.

45:56.776 --> 46:02.071
Never left.
I'm sure you are caring now.

46:02.547 --> 46:07.562
And if you remember his teachings,
always be with you, okay?

46:20.708 --> 46:23.202
Ven. Give me a hug.

46:26.753 --> 46:29.983
Gonna be okay Everything will be fine.

46:39.756 --> 46:45.097
And now the last point agenda.

46:45.644 --> 46:49.685
A proposal by the
of the Crusade Church Aria...

46:50.316 --> 46:55.219
To buy from Liberty City plot 154,

46:55.848 --> 47:00.353
2500 acres in the northeast corner
of the city limits.

47:00.692 --> 47:04.703
If there is any discussion or objections I -.

47:17.731 --> 47:22.932
Gentlemen, there seats if they wish -...

47:26.806 --> 47:29.871
...right. As I said,

47:31.013 --> 47:34.157
if there are no objections,

47:34.852 --> 47:38.522
recommend to council approval.

47:45.986 --> 47:50.430
Okay, no more issues try, is together -.

47:51.518 --> 47:56.430
Sorry, mayor.
I want to say something.

47:58.309 --> 48:02.673
We all know.
We are neighbors.

48:04.225 --> 48:08.475
And we all know Mr. Bryan.
It is also our neighbor.

48:10.469 --> 48:13.904
Many do not like what it says Mr. Bryan,

48:14.376 --> 48:18.177
but always respect your right to say it.

48:19.158 --> 48:22.991
But now Mr. Bryan wants to buy our land...

48:23.528 --> 48:27.075
...to build a monument to hatred.

48:28.219 --> 48:31.522
But I believe that freedom is not for sale.

48:31.622 --> 48:34.132
Tell, Margo.
Tell.

48:43.649 --> 48:48.749
The law allows me to buy
lands. This is still a free country.

48:49.277 --> 48:52.177
Yes, it's a free country.

48:53.438 --> 48:57.332
Know the words but not their meaning.

48:59.282 --> 49:03.975
You can see it in the faces of the children
looking to the future,

49:04.075 --> 49:08.039
hoping they can always live in freedom,

49:08.564 --> 49:14.616
decently as God wants,
regardless of race, creed or color.

49:16.292 --> 49:18.561
I want to say something.

49:19.332 --> 49:24.467
A threat to freedom here is a
threat to freedom anywhere.

49:24.567 --> 49:25.468
What I mean?

49:25.568 --> 49:30.328
A threat to freedom here is a
threat to freedom anywhere.

49:30.819 --> 49:34.348
I just preach segregation.

49:34.816 --> 49:38.046
I have the right to take -
- We all do.

49:38.341 --> 49:41.194
But
some of his followers take their words...

49:41.294 --> 49:45.129
...
as permission to hate and kill.

49:47.475 --> 49:53.557
We no longer intimidate Mr. Bryan.
Neither your followers.

49:54.185 --> 49:59.253
In Liberty no place for
prejudice, hatred or violence.

50:12.433 --> 50:14.433
Order.

50:14.798 --> 50:16.798
Mr. Bryan.

50:17.749 --> 50:21.753
It seems clear that the
interests of his church...

50:21.853 --> 50:23.353
...do not match...

50:23.453 --> 50:26.361
...with our city.

50:33.789 --> 50:36.069
YES. What hicimos1.

51:01.137 --> 51:04.027
You liked the campfire last night?

51:06.520 --> 51:09.750
I hate it as much as I hate, Chinaman.

51:10.421 --> 51:13.052
Remember that your blood is red like mine.

51:13.152 --> 51:14.831
You wish.

51:14.931 --> 51:17.534
Hansen
do yourself a favor and get out of here.

51:17.634 --> 51:19.674
People, break.
It's over.

51:28.717 --> 51:31.692
Tommy,
what the hell were you doing?

51:31.915 --> 51:35.994
Jack, are you going to sit
back and let us do what...

51:36.094 --> 51:37.369
...the Rev.. Phelps?

51:37.469 --> 51:42.065
I'll but I have to do so by law.

51:43.466 --> 51:47.677
No I think they are following the law.

52:18.203 --> 52:22.538
Margo, why did you put Rose?
- The name is Rosebeth.

52:23.215 --> 52:25.737
But you can call her Rose.

52:38.673 --> 52:42.567
Sometimes
have to pay the price for what you believe.

52:42.667 --> 52:47.650
Is that why you stopped teaching?
- Karen told you?

52:57.524 --> 53:01.845
What else did he say?
- I killed a man.

53:11.435 --> 53:16.318
Killed my friend and came for me.

53:23.616 --> 53:25.748
I had no choice.

53:26.182 --> 53:29.077
I'm sorry, I should not
have brought the issue...

53:29.177 --> 53:30.463
.

53:30.563 --> 53:35.390
What I did was against
all what I believe. Everything.

53:39.265 --> 53:42.337
Tommy, you have to stop blaming.

53:43.087 --> 53:46.827
You said you had no choice
and I believe you.

53:47.426 --> 53:49.860
Now if you have a choice.

53:50.287 --> 53:53.942
You can stay to help your family, or leave.

53:55.337 --> 53:58.737
Hansen will not let them hurt my family.

55:38.877 --> 55:43.848
Give one to Small.

56:03.767 --> 56:05.878
Sorry, sorry.

56:39.217 --> 56:43.637
Where the hell is Hansen?
- In the meeting room, sir.

56:51.671 --> 56:56.163
How could you betray me?
Are assault weapons, weapons of war.

56:56.263 --> 56:59.985
Yes, sir. A race war.
Is imminent.

57:00.447 --> 57:02.907
Is why people fear us. They
think we want to exterminate...

57:03.007 --> 57:04.007
,

57:04.107 --> 57:07.243
not separate them.
- But pastor,

57:07.780 --> 57:12.644
if we want.
- I trusted you.

57:13.282 --> 57:17.995
I gave you a life.
How well you repay me?

57:18.203 --> 57:21.688
The preaches war is the devil's chaplain.

57:22.030 --> 57:24.931
For tomorrow, I want to
you and him out of here.

57:25.031 --> 57:27.987
Men need a new leader.
- I agree.

57:28.446 --> 57:30.446
Out of my way.

57:40.380 --> 57:45.155
Yes men need a new leader.

57:48.817 --> 57:50.817
It was one of ours.

57:52.993 --> 57:56.485
I will decide who they are ours.

57:56.959 --> 58:01.192
What are you doing here?
I told you to follow the Chinese.

58:01.292 --> 58:03.292
I did.

58:03.488 --> 58:08.418
Until last night, that was what the teacher
...Ms. Preston.

58:11.196 --> 58:13.685
Two birds with one stone.

58:14.145 --> 58:17.883
Small, know what to do.

58:26.675 --> 58:28.675
Who are you?

58:39.939 --> 58:41.939
Hey, you.
Stop.

58:43.151 --> 58:46.756
After him.
Come on.

01:00:20.148 --> 01:00:22.431
Rosy, shut up.

01:00:25.795 --> 01:00:28.055
Rosy, what happens?

01:00:55.021 --> 01:00:57.021
Get away from me.

01:00:59.686 --> 01:01:03.171
Come on, hit me.
I like to be rude, right?

01:01:05.993 --> 01:01:08.968
Stay still or I'll cut your throat.

01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:19.309
Enough.

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:21.409
Not here.

01:01:21.492 --> 01:01:23.492
Find him.

01:01:24.168 --> 01:01:26.634
No, you first.

01:01:28.302 --> 01:01:30.302
AcÃ©rquenla.

01:01:32.364 --> 01:01:34.364
Give me the knife.

01:01:35.706 --> 01:01:37.706
Watch...

01:01:46.684 --> 01:01:48.692
Think about that.

01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:17.590
I.
I.

01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:38.791
Thanks for the ride.

01:04:45.961 --> 01:04:47.961
Karen.

01:04:52.087 --> 01:04:54.204
Sons of bitches.

01:04:57.468 --> 01:04:59.537
They took the children.

01:05:08.087 --> 01:05:11.572
You continue fulfilling the law, Sheriff?

01:05:46.181 --> 01:05:48.181
My brothers Aryans,

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:53.774
warriors of God,
I have tragic news.

01:05:54.599 --> 01:05:57.999
Someone brutally murdered our leader.

01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:06.739
This garbage wants to
destroy our movement.

01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:11.174
And tonight, will lead to a troop against us.

01:06:11.705 --> 01:06:15.712
God has asked me to assume the
huge challenge...

01:06:16.184 --> 01:06:19.641
Happened to Pastor Bryan.

01:06:20.284 --> 01:06:24.959
And I ask
fulfill their destiny as warriors of our race.

01:06:25.261 --> 01:06:29.405
Do not underestimate the
intelligence of this monster.

01:06:29.505 --> 01:06:32.402
Have eyes that see in the dark.

01:06:32.825 --> 01:06:38.279
There is more evil in his heart that
courage in you. You have no honor.

01:06:38.379 --> 01:06:44.491
And so I say, brethren,
Arise.

01:06:45.398 --> 01:06:48.990
Y reclaim our destiny.
Arise and claim...

01:06:49.445 --> 01:06:51.402
...the land that our ancestors died.

01:06:51.502 --> 01:06:53.502
We are warriors of God.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:58.784
We Fall to emerge from
above the black grime,

01:06:59.206 --> 01:07:04.002
brown and yellow.
Our skin is our uniform.

01:07:04.652 --> 01:07:09.112
A heart, a heartbeat.
One hundred hearts, one beat.

01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:15.258
Thousand hearts, one beat.
For the win. Sieg Heil.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.599
Where are the children?

01:07:32.097 --> 01:07:34.460
Better talk, kid.

01:10:15.315 --> 01:10:17.315
Is here.

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:44.555
Children?
Justin.?

01:10:45.153 --> 01:10:47.558
Dad?
- Luther.

01:10:53.393 --> 01:10:55.393
Dad.
- Are you okay?

01:10:56.731 --> 01:10:58.731
Are they right?

01:11:05.214 --> 01:11:07.214
Jack.

01:11:09.312 --> 01:11:11.312
Tommy, get down.

01:11:51.122 --> 01:11:53.122
Back.
Will explode.

01:12:13.007 --> 01:12:15.007
Go.

01:12:16.202 --> 01:12:18.202
Are you ready, kids?

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:24.700
Luther, Justin, come on.
Go back and crouch.

01:12:29.224 --> 01:12:31.224
Jack.

01:12:39.836 --> 01:12:42.471
Come on, come on, turning back.

01:12:47.338 --> 01:12:49.715
Down.
'll Make it.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.080
Keep. The will delay.

01:15:05.072 --> 01:15:08.285
Come on.
What do you expect?

01:15:10.344 --> 01:15:14.278
Go or ruin their asses.

01:15:37.191 --> 01:15:39.191
God, please...

01:16:10.175 --> 01:16:12.491
Margo, go.

01:16:15.997 --> 01:16:18.600
Go on, go.

01:16:39.364 --> 01:16:41.200
Idiot.

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.533
Out of my way.

01:17:21.274 --> 01:17:23.274
Over there.

01:17:33.626 --> 01:17:35.626
Drop it.

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:40.070
You...

01:17:42.438 --> 01:17:44.818
When will you learn, boy?

01:18:05.636 --> 01:18:11.188
Come on, Lee.
Can not we get along?

01:20:53.258 --> 01:20:56.658
We will now see that color your skin is.

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:48.320
Go ahead and do...

01:22:48.705 --> 01:22:51.392
I hate this world.

01:22:52.458 --> 01:22:54.879
Come on, buddy.

01:23:07.173 --> 01:23:10.812
Hate is not the solution.

01:23:28.221 --> 01:23:31.468
Of course not, friend.

01:23:33.356 --> 01:23:36.821
Made a big mistake.

01:23:37.519 --> 01:23:41.203
Shoot him the son of a bitch.

01:23:44.159 --> 01:23:47.935
What are you doing?
I said I'd shoot.

01:23:48.346 --> 01:23:53.756
Kill the motherfucker.
Ell Armageddon is coming.

01:23:54.317 --> 01:23:57.456
The Apocalypse has arrived.

01:25:33.881 --> 01:25:34.881

01:25:34.981 --> 01:25:38.321
