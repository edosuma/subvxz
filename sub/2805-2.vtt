PETER: <i>Previously on</i> White Collar...

00:02.878 --> 00:03.879
This is a good office.

00:03.962 --> 00:05.506
But the one next door
has a much nicer view.

00:05.589 --> 00:06.632
The ASAC's office?

00:06.757 --> 00:08.675
They want me to run White Collar division?

00:08.884 --> 00:11.011
-NEAL: <i>What's the gold for, Hagen?</i>
-CURTIS:<i> Why's that matter to you?</i>

00:11.094 --> 00:12.888
Because I can tell
when I've stepped into a trap.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.556
My appeal's coming up.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.517
You're gonna help set me free.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.353
-Hey, boss.
-PETER: Diana.

00:19.478 --> 00:20.646
Look at you. I...

00:20.771 --> 00:21.939
It's a boy.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.733
You're choosing someone from
outside the office to be my new handler.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.818
Someone who will see you as you are.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.153
A criminal.

-(MUSIC STOPS)
-Bang. You're dead.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.764
Since when do
surveillance cameras go "bang?"

00:56.181 --> 00:58.225
Oh, since when do you overstep your mark?

00:58.308 --> 00:59.726
Take it easy, Bob Fosse.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.603
You know, anxiety doesn't become you.

01:01.687 --> 01:04.064
I'm gonna get it.
I only had 20 feet to go this time.

01:04.189 --> 01:07.025
At this point,
20 feet might as well be Hannibal's march.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.237
-Hyperbolize much?
-I am serious.

01:10.362 --> 01:14.199
Hagen's bonds will be in
the FBI's evidence lockup in three days.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.743
If one of those cameras spots you,
you are toast.

01:16.827 --> 01:20.372
If you're aiming to reduce my anxiety,
I'm not the only one missing my mark.

01:20.497 --> 01:24.459
I am just trying to make your anxiety
appropriately focused.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.378
You're not the one getting a new handler.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.463
You know, I think that's for the best.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.758
We've become way too chummy
with these G-men.

01:31.884 --> 01:34.094
Maybe a new handler will remind us

01:34.178 --> 01:36.346
why snakes don't fraternize
with mongeese.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.472
Mongeese?

01:38.056 --> 01:39.600
Mongooses?

01:40.350 --> 01:42.936
That's why I always go
with scorpions and frogs.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.521
How we doing
on the Spanish Victory Bonds?

01:44.605 --> 01:45.647
Hey.

01:45.898 --> 01:49.067
The bonds have to look
as if they have deteriorated naturally,

01:49.151 --> 01:51.320
so I'm hoping we can induce photolysis.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.488
-Ultraviolet light.
-Yeah.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.824
I came up with the idea
while I was sunning.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.368
The radiation source
has to be very strong.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.830
But if it is, the bonds should wilt
like a newspaper left out in the sun.

02:01.914 --> 02:04.416
Like an inadmissible newspaper.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.418
Yeah. What's our light source?

02:06.668 --> 02:09.254
That is my problem. You...
You have footwork to master.

02:09.421 --> 02:10.756
Back to one.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.426
(OPERA PLAYING)

02:25.938 --> 02:28.649
Shouldn't your mug say
"World's Greatest ASAC" now?

02:28.732 --> 02:32.569
Figured I ought to serve out my first week
before I make that claim.

02:32.945 --> 02:35.781
-"World's greatest aspiring ASAC"?
-You're late.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.284
We usually just hang out
and drink coffee for the first half hour.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.787
We do not hang out and drink coffee.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.706
Well, today, we have work.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.667
I made the call.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.919
Jones arrested Brendan Holland
this morning.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.630
"Three Time" Holland? The Gray Trade guy?

02:52.631 --> 02:54.716
If we already arrested him,
why call in the cavalry?

02:54.842 --> 02:57.219
If you were on time, you'd know.

02:57.970 --> 03:01.390
Hey, uh, my new handler, is he in there?

03:01.473 --> 03:03.308
You're getting a new handler today?

03:04.309 --> 03:06.228
-Yeah, he's in there.
-So?

03:06.562 --> 03:08.313
-So what?
-So what's he like?

03:08.397 --> 03:11.024
Probably late middle-aged, curmudgeonly,

03:11.108 --> 03:12.943
prefers <i>SportsCenter</i>
to <i>Masterpiece Theatre.</i>

03:13.026 --> 03:14.403
-Curmudgeonly?
-Did I nail it?

03:14.486 --> 03:15.487
Mmm.

03:17.072 --> 03:20.701
You're an expert on handlers.
I'll let you figure it out.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.709
JONES: Guys, we're low on manpower,
so it's only four to a team, okay?

03:28.834 --> 03:29.835
So keep your wits about you.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.753
Agent Berrigan will coordinate from here.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.839
Targets will be prioritized
by threat level

03:33.922 --> 03:35.424
and estimated seizure value.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.759
Ideally, we'll synchronize our arrests.

03:38.427 --> 03:39.428
Oh!

03:39.845 --> 03:40.888
Who are we arresting?

03:40.971 --> 03:42.389
Debrief started 15 minutes ago.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.725
-Consultants make their own hours.
-No, they don't.

03:45.017 --> 03:46.310
Some of them do.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.813
This morning, we brought in
Brendan "Three Time" Holland.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.065
-Holland operates...
-Graytrade.com, yeah.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.109
It's the black market equivalent of eBay.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.403
That's... That's all I know.
You can keep going.

03:56.528 --> 03:59.323
Oh, no, like you said,
Gray Trade is an online marketplace

03:59.489 --> 04:02.284
that has damn near
every contraband imaginable.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.286
Thank you. Diana?

04:04.369 --> 04:06.371
Yeah, we're looking at
stolen credit card numbers,

04:06.580 --> 04:08.707
counterfeit passports, missing artwork.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.375
Is that a slow loris?

04:10.626 --> 04:13.378
Caffrey, have you seen my stomach?

04:14.254 --> 04:15.589
I'm pretty sure that's a trick question.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.007
I'm eight months pregnant.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.593
I'm not eating or sleeping well,
so I'm in no mood.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.762
So I'll keep
my interruptions to a minimum.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.013
Got it. It is cute, though.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.890
-The slow loris.
-And it's endangered.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.058
Look, guys,

04:26.141 --> 04:28.852
simply shutting down Gray Trade
was a big win for the bureau.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.396
We have an opportunity
to make it even bigger.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.065
We're going to arrest the sellers.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.984
We can track their IPs through the site,
which means we know where they live.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.319
And we have dossiers made up,

04:37.402 --> 04:39.571
but once these guys notice
that the site has been decommissioned,

04:39.655 --> 04:40.656
they're gonna close up shop.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.823
That's why, even shorthanded,

04:41.949 --> 04:43.492
we're gonna hammer as many
as we can today.

04:43.659 --> 04:45.244
I swear to God, Caffrey, what?

04:45.327 --> 04:48.205
If the bureau keeps Gray Trade
up and running for a few days,

04:48.288 --> 04:50.040
we can take our time and bust all of them.

04:50.165 --> 04:53.001
Can't concede the sale of illegal goods,
even in the short term.

04:53.252 --> 04:55.712
We don't necessarily
have to concede anything.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.799
Really? Well, we're all ears.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.220
-Do you want to explain?
-No, please.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.558
We drum up fake user names,
then outbid everyone else.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.768
Since the plan is to arrest them anyway,

05:09.852 --> 05:11.645
the bureau won't be on the hook
for the payout.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.690
Be a lot of work. It's not a bad idea.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.400
Thanks for the assist.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.986
Guess I was wrong about curmudgeonly.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.529
-I'm sorry? Hmm?
-What?

05:20.612 --> 05:23.490
Uh, it doesn't matter. Neal Caffrey.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.159
-You must be my new handler.
-Must be.

I'm 31, but don't read into it.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.274
Agent Siegel was
a top graduate at Quantico

05:57.357 --> 06:00.569
and served as supervisor
in the Chicago White Collar division

06:00.652 --> 06:02.070
for the past two years.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.822
Actually, almost three, sir.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.200
Windy City division
had a work-release CI too.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.659
Modeled his deal after yours, Neal.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.328
Siegel was his handler.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.205
They had a closure rate in the 70s.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.290
Nice rates. Why come to New York?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.042
70s are nice. 80s are better.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.710
-Eighty-seven.
-Right?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.378
SIEGEL: I wanna work with you, Neal.

06:18.462 --> 06:19.838
You're the best there is.

06:19.922 --> 06:22.841
Your skills are unmatched.
And your smarts are unparalleled.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.885
You might be the most valuable asset
the FBI has.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.012
-Might be.
-All right, that's enough.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.388
Do you prefer David or Dave?

06:28.472 --> 06:29.973
I'd like to speak to this agent privately.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.099
-It's easier for me if I know...
-Go.

06:31.183 --> 06:32.976

-All right.

I was gonna give you my old office.

Oh, thank you, sir.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.154
-But you're not the right man for the job.
-I'm sorry?

06:44.363 --> 06:46.532
Neal Caffrey is a confidence man.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.494
He preys on trust, desire
and impressionability.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.080
The last thing he needs
is a lapdog as a handler.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.541
-I'm no lapdog, sir.
-Sure as hell fooled me.

06:55.624 --> 06:56.792
I'm hoping I fooled him too.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.962
One thing I learned about CIs like Neal,

07:00.087 --> 07:02.714
they like smoke,
and I know exactly where to blow it.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.967
-You were playing him?
-I was handling him.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.179
Start moving in tomorrow.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.938
Gotta tell ya, I really like this new kid.

How's Neal?

Neal?

07:29.199 --> 07:31.577
You got promoted,
and he has a new handler.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.245
It's been a big change for him, too.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.371
Mmm-hmm.

07:35.581 --> 07:37.165
You haven't talked to him yet, have you?

07:37.291 --> 07:40.210
Oh, we talk. Yeah, of course we talk.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.130
I should reach out to him.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.215
Yeah.

Okay.

Are you following me?

Oh, I don't need to follow you.
You're wearing a tracking anklet.

08:10.616 --> 08:11.617
Uh-huh.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.660
We hadn't talked in a while.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.496
Just a friendly coffee-chat-
and-walk-to-the-office thing?

08:16.622 --> 08:19.249
-Yeah.
-I can handle that.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.793
Any reason I might be following you?

08:21.877 --> 08:24.463
Aside from that you've been following me
for almost a decade?

08:24.546 --> 08:25.964
Aside from that.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.050
I don't think your new title
calls for legwork.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.510
No, I guess not.

08:29.635 --> 08:33.472
So, how was day number one?

08:33.597 --> 08:35.557
-With Siegel?
-Yeah.

08:35.641 --> 08:37.351
He reminds me of
one of the von Trapp children,

08:37.476 --> 08:39.895
and he's a little overeager,
but for the most part, I like him.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.814
He's intelligent, capable, self-aware.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.066
He loves you, huh?

08:44.149 --> 08:46.735
I know when
someone is playing to my vanity, okay?

08:46.818 --> 08:49.404
But the fact is
he came to New York for a reason.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.198
You are one hell of an informant.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.367
I'm usually just following your lead.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.619
It's good you like him.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.830
-Yeah, as long as things with us are...
-Normal?

08:59.081 --> 09:00.082
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

09:00.165 --> 09:03.043
I might have a different title,
but I'm still the same old me.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.294
Me, too.

-Maybe I should be following you.

What's going on?

09:17.975 --> 09:19.226
I'm multi-geeking.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.144
In addition to posing
as "Three Time" Holland,

09:21.228 --> 09:23.856
I'm balancing chats and auctions
under 40 separate nyms.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.859
I don't know what that means.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.361
Multi-geeking is when you operate
more than one computer,

09:29.444 --> 09:32.406
and a nym is a pseudonym,
avatar, user name, whatever.

09:32.656 --> 09:35.200
Did you spend the night here?

09:35.284 --> 09:36.618
Three Time never slept before.

09:36.702 --> 09:38.579
-He can't start now.
-And you're drinking coffee.

It's herbal tea.

09:41.707 --> 09:44.251

I can get someone...

I'm not trusting this to some NFG.
You wanna help? Pull up a chair.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.882
Yes. Yes, sure.

Thank you. Seriously, thank you.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.064
Yeah, too much herbal tea.

10:06.356 --> 10:07.482
You choose a target?

10:07.566 --> 10:10.027
Well, I'm digging through
the Gray Trade files,

10:10.110 --> 10:12.279
and I settle on this one.
Little Star Merchandise.

10:12.362 --> 10:15.032
-Little Star?
-Yeah. You know it?

10:15.282 --> 10:16.408
Can't say I do.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.160
PETER: These guys are definitely selling.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.662
Must be millions in looted art
and antiquities.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.414
Yeah, Little Star's
our diamond in the rough here.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.209
Wait, guys, shouldn't we go after
someone more dangerous?

10:25.459 --> 10:26.919
An arms dealer, maybe?

10:27.002 --> 10:28.253
Are you kidding me?

10:28.420 --> 10:29.630
This thing is right in your wheelhouse.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.340
Yeah, look, they have Fabergé eggs.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.091
Oh, Peter, you know me so well.

10:33.175 --> 10:34.593
You want Little Star? It's yours.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.011
I'd give you a team...

10:36.094 --> 10:38.472
But you're already shorthanded.
I know. I know.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.390
It's all right, me and Neal,
we can manage alone, right?

10:40.599 --> 10:42.976
Yeah. I'm sure we'll manage.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.527
On the surface, Little Star is

10:51.610 --> 10:54.696
a thriving importer of antiques
and old world curios.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.823
But if these Gray Trade
sales lists are legit...

10:56.949 --> 10:59.660
He's selling a lot more
than trinkets and baubles.

11:01.245 --> 11:02.329
He?

11:03.497 --> 11:06.333
English doesn't have
a gender-neutral singular pronoun.

11:06.667 --> 11:11.046
You think behind those crates are
a 13x19-foot Jan Matejko battle scape,

11:11.129 --> 11:13.715
a Bohemian crystal chandelier,

11:13.799 --> 11:15.968
and a "strongbox of Portuguese dobrão"?

11:16.051 --> 11:18.387
And two imperial Fabergé eggs.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.471
Where do you even find these things?

11:19.805 --> 11:21.306
Europe in the '40s.

11:21.390 --> 11:24.309
Look, if this stuff isn't in there
and we start flashing badges...

11:24.393 --> 11:26.562
-Yeah, we're gonna spook 'em.
-Yeah.

11:27.271 --> 11:28.272
(SIGHS)

11:29.857 --> 11:31.400
What are you thinking?

11:33.694 --> 11:36.655
I go in as a designer,
argue that I had an appointment.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.991
I'll check the place out
while they're showing off the wares.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.075
What am I doing?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.453
Peter wouldn't have passed for a designer,
but you actually could.

11:43.537 --> 11:44.621
We could be associates.

11:46.248 --> 11:47.249
Great.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.334
Assuming you can speak
from a place of education

11:49.459 --> 11:51.461
on Islamic influence
in Silk Road ceramics.

11:52.296 --> 11:53.589
Silk Road.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.174
Don't worry about it.

11:55.257 --> 11:56.758
How about I go in first,

11:56.967 --> 11:58.343
and I'll pull you in
once I've checked the place out

11:58.427 --> 11:59.428
and confirmed it's legit?

11:59.511 --> 12:01.597
Okay. All right.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.724
Neal, be careful.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.225
This is not an arms dealer,

12:05.392 --> 12:07.060
but we still don't know
who we're up against, right?

12:07.603 --> 12:08.687
Right.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.673
Hey, we gotta get you out of here.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.260
Neal, I repurposed a UV inductor
from a tanning bed.

12:40.511 --> 12:43.222
Perfect radiation. Bye-bye, victory bonds.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.140
-Shouldn't you be at work?
-I am at work.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.934
My new handler is looking
for the proprietor

12:47.017 --> 12:48.185
of Little Star Merchandise.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.603
Oh, the Persian rug sale.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.397
No, Moz, he's here to arrest you.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.406
You don't have a contingency plan?

13:01.490 --> 13:03.033
I have contingency plans.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.326
What do you think I'm doing?

13:04.409 --> 13:06.203
I don't know, some last-minute filing?

13:06.286 --> 13:07.371
How could you bring him here?

13:07.454 --> 13:10.707
I didn't bring anyone here.
The bureau cracked Gray Trade.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.256
I knew when those pencil necks
at UCLA invented the Internet

13:17.339 --> 13:19.007
that I would end up like a trapped rat.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.677
Mozzie, I'm gonna get you out of here,
but I need you to breathe.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.179
I can't breathe. I refuse to breathe.

13:24.263 --> 13:27.015
I am enacting the Roanoke Praxis.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.935
-What's the Roanoke Praxis?
-My ultimate disappearing act.

13:30.102 --> 13:31.854
-Are those...
-My teeth, yes.

13:32.104 --> 13:35.190
How did you...
Actually, no. I don't wanna know.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.276
Why are your teeth in a plastic bottle?

13:37.526 --> 13:39.528
MOZZIE'S VOICE: <i>Oh, my God, it burns!</i>

13:39.653 --> 13:42.531
They have to find something in the fire.
Watch this.

13:44.283 --> 13:45.576
Are you crazy?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.578
This is awesome.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.711
-What are you doing?
-I'm canceling the Roanoke Praxis.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.629
(ALARM BLARING)

13:59.131 --> 14:00.632
What the hell?

14:02.092 --> 14:05.137
Does your other contingency plan
involve burning anything down?

14:05.220 --> 14:07.347
-Not as such.
-Then we're going with that one.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.057
Now, gather up your teeth and get out.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.769
And leave the tomatoes.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.690
WOMAN: Hey. Hey. Hey!

14:16.899 --> 14:18.442
It says "By appointment only."

14:18.567 --> 14:20.402
-Can you read?
-You hear the fire alarm?

14:20.485 --> 14:22.070
I'm a federal agent. I'm coming in.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.573
-What the hell, Neal?
-Maybe I got made.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.909
Can you cut that off, please?

14:29.411 --> 14:32.039
Now, I'm under the impression that
Neal Caffrey doesn't get made.

14:32.331 --> 14:33.832
If you had something to do
with this, Neal, I swear...

14:33.957 --> 14:36.418
Look, I can assure you,
blaring alarms are not my style.

14:36.585 --> 14:37.711
Hey! Stop!

14:38.545 --> 14:41.507
-Persian rug sale?
-Get your hands up.

14:41.590 --> 14:42.758
You're not going anywhere.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.010
Tell that to Emile Berliner.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.803
(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING)

15:01.610 --> 15:03.195
Man, he's fast.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.864
Wouldn't have thought
the little guy had it in him.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.951
-Should we split up?
-No, no. He's gone.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.835
Any idea who Emile Berliner is?

15:18.126 --> 15:21.505
Couldn't even venture a guess.
He was just burning documents in here.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.008
-We had our chance, and we missed him.
-Not necessarily.

15:30.806 --> 15:32.349
(WHIRRING)

15:32.641 --> 15:35.185
-Anything?
-Uh, there's life, but not much.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.937
Do you think we'll be able to...

15:37.479 --> 15:38.564
I doubt it.

15:38.689 --> 15:40.065
Between the fire damage
and the encryption,

15:40.148 --> 15:41.483
it's like digging through lasagna.

15:41.567 --> 15:42.568
Let me take a shot at it.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.736
I have some computer
forensics experience.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.655
Computer forensics. How fortunate.

15:46.864 --> 15:48.240
I'll take this in my office.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.534
We lost Little Star?

15:51.743 --> 15:55.163
He had, uh, some kind of escape plan.

15:55.247 --> 15:56.456
Did you get a visual?

15:56.790 --> 15:59.793
Short, balding, bespectacled.

16:01.587 --> 16:02.671
Tell me you're joking.

16:03.088 --> 16:06.592
Short, bald guy with pre-war treasure.
Diana, sound like somebody we know?

16:06.842 --> 16:09.011
-What?
-Never mind.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.847
Agent Burke, you think
we have a positive ID on this Little Star?

16:11.930 --> 16:12.973
Ask Neal.

16:13.098 --> 16:16.768
I have a friend who fits the bill,
and Agent Burke is jumping to conclusions.

16:16.852 --> 16:19.855
Look, whoever he is, we saw him.
You can sketch him, right?

16:20.022 --> 16:21.190
Shouldn't be a problem.

16:21.732 --> 16:22.733
Good.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.035
That's Little Star?

16:33.160 --> 16:35.204
And I think we can both agree
it looks nothing like Mozzie.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.663
(SIGHING)

16:37.289 --> 16:39.917
-I want Siegel to confirm.
-No problem.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.345
Satisfied?

17:04.358 --> 17:05.817
Pictures don't lie.

17:05.901 --> 17:07.611
It's one hell of a coincidence.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.030
Farsightedness and male-pattern baldness
are epidemic, Peter.

17:11.406 --> 17:12.449
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

17:12.533 --> 17:13.700
Peter, you have a minute?

17:13.867 --> 17:16.286
Sure, come on in. Get that to Siegel.

17:17.913 --> 17:19.540
Excuse me.

17:20.541 --> 17:22.835
-We have to talk about Diana.
-(CHUCKLES)

17:23.293 --> 17:26.296
-Don't worry. I'm gonna pull her out.
-Oh, I don't think you should.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.090
You've already taken her off fieldwork.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.300
She's eight months pregnant.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.553
And about to pop, but she says she's fine.

17:33.929 --> 17:36.431
She's been camped out
in the conference room for two days.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.101
Running a city-wide operation.

17:40.811 --> 17:44.147
Jones, I can't put her or her baby at risk

17:44.231 --> 17:46.608
just because she wants
to close the book on Gray Trade.

17:48.235 --> 17:51.822
Look, Peter, I'm no psychologist,
but I don't think it's about this case.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.325
She's staring down
the barrel at Diana Berrigan,

17:55.409 --> 17:57.160
single mother, and that's scary.

17:57.953 --> 18:01.373
But I think the idea of her losing
Diana Berrigan, Special Agent...

18:01.456 --> 18:02.457
(CLICKING TONGUE)

18:02.541 --> 18:03.959
I just think that's scarier.

18:07.838 --> 18:09.464
She knows she always has a place here.

18:09.548 --> 18:11.008
But does she?

18:11.300 --> 18:15.137
I mean, you were talking about taking her
off casework because she's tired.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.764
And are you really gonna feel good
about sending her on a raid

18:17.973 --> 18:19.057
when she's got a kid at home?

18:23.395 --> 18:24.813
Look, you're the boss now.

18:24.897 --> 18:27.816
It's a tough call.
I get the position you're in.

18:28.108 --> 18:31.820
I'm just saying
I get the position she's in, too.

18:41.914 --> 18:45.167
You know, if you're bored,
I'm sure Berrigan could use your help.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.464
Nope, I'm not bored.

18:54.551 --> 18:57.054
The name Teddy Winters
mean anything to you?

18:57.179 --> 18:58.388
Never heard of him.

18:59.139 --> 19:03.143
Mmm. Maybe Teddy Winters is Little Star.

19:03.227 --> 19:05.270
Let's see what we got on him.

19:06.021 --> 19:08.524
Where are you, Teddy?

19:09.191 --> 19:13.028
Bingo. Prints,
dental records, bank accounts.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.363
Photograph?

19:14.488 --> 19:16.406
No, doesn't look like it.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.909
Teddy Winters is on the grid,
but only barely.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.537
Anything actionable?

19:23.789 --> 19:25.040
Not yet.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.384
MOZZIE: Were you followed?

19:39.263 --> 19:41.181
Oh, God.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.103
The FBI shuts down Little Star,

19:46.186 --> 19:48.480
and this is your alternative
revenue stream?

19:48.564 --> 19:52.109
This is my camouflage,
security through obscurity.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.944
Not sure that principle applies here.

19:54.027 --> 19:57.197
Says you. Plus I made $11.50. 75.

19:57.531 --> 19:59.199
High roller.

19:59.491 --> 20:02.327
Listen, with all the heat
here in New York,

20:02.452 --> 20:04.454
I'm thinking of catching
a train down to Miami.

20:04.580 --> 20:07.958
You can stick around a little longer.
I managed to steer Peter off the scent.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.586
Oh. A slight reprieve. And Little Star?

20:11.128 --> 20:12.963
Siegel did salvage your laptop.

20:13.046 --> 20:17.259
That's why you can't prematurely
extinguish the Roanoke Praxis.

20:17.426 --> 20:19.094
All he found was an alias.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.264
Oh. Well, aliases are a dime a dozen.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.933
So which one of my noms de guerre
am I retiring?

20:25.017 --> 20:27.728
I think it's from before I knew you.
Teddy Winters?

20:30.063 --> 20:31.106
They found me.

20:31.481 --> 20:34.276
I'm sorry, that wasn't clear
when you were being held at gunpoint?

20:34.401 --> 20:36.945
No, you don't understand. They found me.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.281
So you stay out of the light
and burn an alias.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.657
It's hardly DEFCON 1.

20:40.782 --> 20:43.911
Teddy Winters isn't an alias, Neal.

20:45.704 --> 20:48.498
-You mean...
-Exactly.

20:54.963 --> 20:58.008
Babies in baskets rarely arrive
with birth certificates.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.384
I was no exception.

20:59.635 --> 21:02.679
I was homeless, nameless, purposeless.

21:02.763 --> 21:03.847
Histrionic.

21:03.931 --> 21:08.310
You'll never really understand
the plight of the orphaned, not truly.

21:08.894 --> 21:11.855
If you showed up without a name,
where did Teddy Winters come in?

21:11.939 --> 21:14.733
Oh, well, once I got old enough,

21:14.816 --> 21:17.653
I struck out to uncover my origins.

21:17.736 --> 21:20.697
I started at
the Wayne County clerk's office.

21:20.948 --> 21:22.491
You were checking birth certificates?

21:22.574 --> 21:23.575
Mmm-hmm.

21:23.700 --> 21:28.997
Every boy in or around Detroit
born a month prior to my abandonment.

21:29.081 --> 21:30.582
And that's where you found Teddy Winters.

21:30.666 --> 21:34.002
Yeah, his was the only certificate
unaccounted for.

21:34.086 --> 21:37.714
Every other baby boy had
either a body or a grave.

21:38.757 --> 21:40.008
You do look like a Teddy.

21:41.134 --> 21:44.263
-Frankly, I prefer Theodore.
-Good to know.

21:45.055 --> 21:47.516
That name is tied to everything, Neal.

21:48.100 --> 21:52.855
My storehouses, my safe houses,
my traditional houses.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.858
If they have Teddy, they have it all.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.318
Why keep it active after all this time?

22:00.112 --> 22:03.532
Just in case my parents came looking.

22:05.701 --> 22:08.829
If you let Teddy die,
no one would ever find him.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.126
Including the FBI.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.669
Mozzie, I hate to say this,

22:15.794 --> 22:17.713
but I think
you might have had the right idea earlier.

22:33.061 --> 22:34.438
-Can we trade jobs?
-Nope.

22:34.605 --> 22:36.773
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

22:36.857 --> 22:38.984
I'm not the one who thinks
my teeth need a different host.

22:39.109 --> 22:40.194
Well, they do.

22:41.111 --> 22:42.613
You're not usually this squeamish.

22:42.696 --> 22:45.616
Well, pulling my own teeth is one thing,
but a dead man's?

22:45.782 --> 22:47.826
On the off chance that
there actually is a heaven,

22:47.993 --> 22:49.953
this is definitely gonna get me barred.

22:50.037 --> 22:52.873
I think we took heaven off the table
a long time ago, Mozzie.

22:52.956 --> 22:56.001
Fine, I'll go to the morgue,
but I'm doing this under protest.

22:56.168 --> 22:59.338
Duly noted. I'll meet you back here
in half an hour with the combustibles.

22:59.421 --> 23:02.883
Great, whatever you get,
just make sure it makes a loud boom.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.593
I can do that.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.472
You're here early.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.307
I wanna keep on top of Teddy Winters.

23:10.474 --> 23:13.727
I've been going over this guy's assets,
and there's not a lot here,

23:13.810 --> 23:14.937
but I did find that.

23:16.230 --> 23:17.856
An account in the Caymans.

23:17.940 --> 23:20.817
Looks like a shell company,
offshore laundry, maybe.

23:20.943 --> 23:22.236
I don't think so.

23:22.319 --> 23:25.322
When shells launder money,
corporate profits are all over the map.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.366
These earnings are pretty regular.

23:28.700 --> 23:29.910
You're right, it's a holding company.

23:30.285 --> 23:32.913
Question is,
what is Teddy Winters holding?

23:35.916 --> 23:38.293
Seriously? Gasoline and Styrofoam?

23:39.169 --> 23:40.712
Don't you think homemade napalm

23:40.796 --> 23:43.966
is a bit vulgar

any significant time beggaring...

23:52.015 --> 23:53.517

-Fine.

38:35.691 --> 38:36.692
El.

38:37.818 --> 38:40.153
-ELIZABETH: Peter?
-Yup.

38:41.154 --> 38:43.448
Oh, honey. Come on. We gotta go.

38:43.574 --> 38:45.242
No, I just got here.

38:45.325 --> 38:46.535
Didn't you get my message?

38:47.536 --> 38:50.163
No. There was a fire.

38:50.247 --> 38:52.791
Then Neal forgot his hat.

38:53.125 --> 38:55.085
His hat? Honey, you gotta get up. Come on.

38:55.169 --> 38:57.713
-(GROANS) What's going on?
-We gotta get to the hospital.

38:57.796 --> 38:58.881
The hospital?

39:00.174 --> 39:01.967
What's going on at the hospital?

39:08.932 --> 39:11.268
Diana, he is so beautiful.

39:11.351 --> 39:13.061
Yep, you've really outdone
yourself this time.

39:13.270 --> 39:15.522
Thank you, guys, for being here.

39:15.606 --> 39:17.733
Look at him. He has little ears.

39:17.900 --> 39:20.152
What exactly were you expecting, Suit?

39:20.235 --> 39:21.361
What are you even doing here?

39:21.445 --> 39:23.197
He's all right.

39:23.405 --> 39:25.449
You know, since Christie and I broke up,

39:26.825 --> 39:28.493
I don't have a lot of family.

39:28.744 --> 39:30.078
You guys are it.

39:31.455 --> 39:32.998
Even him somehow.

39:33.832 --> 39:34.917
JONES: Little man have a name?

39:35.000 --> 39:36.710
(CLEARS THROAT) Clinton maybe?

39:37.961 --> 39:39.838
You know, I was thinking Theo.

39:41.924 --> 39:43.258
As in Theodore Winters?

39:43.717 --> 39:44.718
Huh?

39:45.886 --> 39:47.304
Yeah, I guess.

39:47.387 --> 39:49.097
Must have been floating around my head.

39:49.181 --> 39:51.808
Wait, wait, you named him
after a criminal?

39:53.644 --> 39:55.020
I mean, no offense to present company.

39:55.312 --> 39:56.563
None taken.

39:56.647 --> 39:57.898
ELIZABETH: I think it's beautiful.

39:57.981 --> 40:00.025
-It's very noble.
-Regal, even.

40:01.568 --> 40:03.278
So, how long you gonna
be out of the office?

40:03.362 --> 40:07.407
As long as it takes.
Promise me that you will take your time.

40:07.658 --> 40:09.243
I promise.

40:09.826 --> 40:11.870
I haven't slept in a couple of days.

40:11.995 --> 40:13.247
-ELIZABETH: I think that's our cue.
-Okay.

40:13.330 --> 40:14.498
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

40:14.581 --> 40:16.333
-Bye, sweetheart.
-NEAL: Bye, Mom.

40:24.216 --> 40:26.677
The nurse said that you had him
before you got here.

40:27.010 --> 40:29.263
Yeah, I went into labor early.

40:30.347 --> 40:31.723
You did it all on your own?

40:32.558 --> 40:33.934
No.

40:34.017 --> 40:36.854
Someone helped me.
Someone I didn't know.

40:37.479 --> 40:38.522
Who was it?

40:39.439 --> 40:40.691
Never got a name.

40:42.651 --> 40:45.070
Doesn't seem like justice is being served.

40:48.198 --> 40:50.325
To not know who to thank, I mean.

40:51.201 --> 40:52.578
Yeah.

40:53.495 --> 40:55.914
Maybe I'll try to track him down
once I'm back on my feet.

40:55.998 --> 40:58.750
Yeah. That might be a good idea.

41:01.253 --> 41:02.921
Good night, Momma.

41:15.559 --> 41:16.977
It's poetic, you know.

41:17.060 --> 41:19.855
One Teddy dies. Another is born.

41:20.397 --> 41:24.902
Maybe he'll call me "Papa" or "Papoose."
"Papoose" would be good.

41:25.319 --> 41:27.029
I think you're gonna be
disappointed on that one.

41:27.988 --> 41:32.159
It feels odd to be once and for all
truly nameless.

41:32.451 --> 41:34.870
That which we call a rose, Moz.

41:34.953 --> 41:37.873
-Teddy may be gone, but...
-But I still smell as sweet.

41:37.956 --> 41:40.751
Not what I was gonna say, but, yeah.

41:40.918 --> 41:43.378
What, hadn't you been itching
for a new beginning?

41:43.837 --> 41:45.589
Yeah, it cost me everything.

41:45.672 --> 41:46.924
Well, we kept you out of prison.

41:47.799 --> 41:50.928
I suppose a Pyrrhic victory
is still a victory.

41:52.638 --> 41:56.308
Speaking of bittersweet success,
the Mozart worked like a charm.

41:56.391 --> 41:57.392
MOZZIE: Mmm.

41:58.393 --> 42:01.438
So, Hagen will get his retrial,

42:01.522 --> 42:05.609
and that sociopathic blackmailer
will be back out on the street.

42:07.277 --> 42:08.862
Hey, you paid the piper.

42:09.154 --> 42:10.948
That's the end, isn't it?

42:14.326 --> 42:15.911
I hope so, Moz.

42:19.665 --> 42:20.791
But I have a feeling

42:22.125 --> 42:23.627
it's just the beginning.
