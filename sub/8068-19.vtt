Dan, come on.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.767
Get up.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.137
Dan, get up.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.071
Come on, Dan.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.774
Oh, it's a beautiful morning.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.509
The sun is shining,
the birds are

01:15.609 --> 01:17.911
chirping, and let's
get up, and embrace

01:18.011 --> 01:21.048
the wondrousness of it all.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.750
You embrace it.

01:22.850 --> 01:23.651
Come on, get up.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.686
We've got to earn a living.

Hey, mom.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.342
Hey, you're supposed
to knock, pard.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.377
Sorry.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.479
Mom, will you buy me
some finger paint?

01:51.579 --> 01:52.746
No.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.383
I have to paint a picture
of the family for school.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.385
Can you paint us independently
wealthy so we don't

01:57.485 --> 01:58.919
have to go to work anymore?

01:59.019 --> 01:59.787
Sure.

01:59.887 --> 02:00.688
Groovy.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.223
I'll buy it for you.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.123
All right, Rembrandt.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.858
Go wake up your sisters.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.261
All right!

[grunts in pain]

02:12.166 --> 02:14.502
Good morning, honey!

02:14.602 --> 02:15.403
Good morning.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.773
(SINGING) Supreme!

02:19.873 --> 02:25.813
In the name of love ,
before you break my heart.

02:25.913 --> 02:26.714
Think it o-over.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.250
And I've been good to you.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.451
Think it oh-over.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.187
And I've been sweet to you.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.655
[drumming on boxes]

02:34.755 --> 02:37.191
Stop in the name
of love, before you--

02:37.291 --> 02:38.492
I think we're ready
to blow this joint

02:38.592 --> 02:39.460
and take it on the road.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.229
Yeah, we could
do up our hair big,

02:41.329 --> 02:43.597
and maybe get down some
groovy dance routine.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.566
Yeah, and then we could
like go on the road,

02:45.666 --> 02:48.802
and OD on drugs while some fat
cat rakes in our royalties,

02:48.902 --> 02:50.338
and we die penniless
and on welfare.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.509
That's a pretty
picture, sister.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.678
What did you get up on the
wrong side of bed this morning?

02:57.778 --> 03:00.281
There is no wrong side of the
bed when there's a man in it.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.682
Well there is if
he's stealing the quilt

03:01.782 --> 03:05.185
and snoring like a big old hog.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.655
Come on, 5:30!

03:07.755 --> 03:11.925
Get me out of this
life sucking dump now!

03:12.025 --> 03:14.262
I hear that.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.930
Know what I do when I get
down about this joint?

03:17.030 --> 03:19.032
You let a smile
be your umbrella?

03:19.132 --> 03:20.368
No.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.603
I fantasize about Booker.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.472
(DISGUSTED) Oh!

03:24.572 --> 03:27.508
Does this fantasy involve
cognac and candlelight?

03:27.608 --> 03:28.609
Mm, definitely.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.910
What do you do?

03:30.010 --> 03:32.246
Douse him with the cognac
and then light him on fire?

03:32.346 --> 03:33.981
[laughing]
- Quiet, you guys.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.048
There he is.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.183
All right, listen
up everybody.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.885
I've got an important
announcement to make.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.587
You're a woman
trapped in a man's body?

03:42.189 --> 03:43.291
That was very funny Roseanne.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.158
Actually, I wanted to
inform you about tonight's

03:45.259 --> 03:46.660
mandatory overtime.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.928
- No!
- What?

03:48.028 --> 03:48.829
Look, I'm sorry.

03:48.929 --> 03:49.897
Machine number three went down.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.231
What's number three
got to do with us?

03:51.332 --> 03:53.301
Well, if I don't get that
Jorgensen order out in time,

03:53.401 --> 03:54.302
I'm looking at layoffs here.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.670
You could have
given us some warning.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.639
I didn't know the machine
was going to break down.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.073
I don't like this
anymore than you do.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.809
You don't do as much as we do.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.312
Yeah, in fact, what
do you do, Booker?

04:04.412 --> 04:08.582
I fire people that
don't work overtime.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.117
Hey, sis, give me
a quarter, would ya?

04:10.217 --> 04:11.719
I got up my kids.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.053
You know the rules, Roseanne.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.988
Booker says we can only use
the phone on coffee breaks.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.491
Oh, who died and
left you hall monitor?

04:17.591 --> 04:19.993
Oh, cut it out.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.296
It's going to add up to a nice
piece of change for you guys.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.897
Yeah, now we can
afford the stone

04:23.997 --> 04:25.833
lion for our villa in France.

04:25.933 --> 04:26.734
No.

04:26.834 --> 04:27.668
Come on.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.703
This could be a
nice wad of cash.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.439
Just give me the quarter
and keep your two cents,

04:31.539 --> 04:32.506
would you, sis?

04:32.606 --> 04:33.574
Jeez.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.175
There's more things
in life than money.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.945
I know, I can't
afford any of them.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.448
Will you call my
house for me, Roseanne.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.783
Well, you know
the rules, Crystal.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.985
My boy's babysitter
leaves at 5:30.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.587
Ask her to stay
until I get home?

04:46.687 --> 04:48.088
- Will you cover for me?
- Deal.

04:48.188 --> 04:48.989
Hurry.

04:51.659 --> 04:54.161
Hey, where are you going?

04:54.261 --> 04:56.464
I've got a board of
directors meeting over here.

04:56.564 --> 04:57.531
Look, this isn't a break.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.467
Roseanne, I need
you on the machine.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.001
Well, I need you off my back.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.870
I got to call my
kids about dinner.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.438
Do it on a break.

05:04.538 --> 05:05.839
Well, what am
I supposed to do?

05:05.939 --> 05:09.477
Call them at 5:15 and tell them
to break out a can of sardines?

05:09.577 --> 05:11.979
Listen, Roseanne,
look, I'm sorry.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.714
It's not my problem.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.182
Not now, but I
mean, it could be

05:15.282 --> 05:17.017
your problem because
if I'm sitting

05:17.117 --> 05:18.419
there worrying about my kids.

05:18.519 --> 05:21.889
You know, I could screw up, and
you wouldn't make your quota.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.090
Come on, Booker.

05:23.190 --> 05:27.561
This is a chance to redeem
your really bad karma.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.762
All right.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.163
Make it snappy.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.799
I don't want everybody else in
here making calls, all right?

05:31.899 --> 05:32.700
Thanks Booker.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.768

a second and I need

05:49.750 --> 05:51.952
you to give me a big favor.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.021
Call up Dwight at the
store and tell him to drive

05:54.121 --> 05:55.556
over to your dad's job site.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.658
He knows where it is.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.759
Are you writing this down?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.027
Yes, mother.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.396
OK, tell Dwight to tell
dad that-- you're not writing

06:02.496 --> 06:03.831
this down at all, are you?

06:03.931 --> 06:05.699
Yes I am.

06:05.799 --> 06:06.967
ROSEANNE (ON PHONE): Becky.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.302
All right.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.138
BECKY (ON PHONE): OK,
tell Dwight to tell dad

06:11.238 --> 06:12.473
that I got overtime tonight.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.174
So he has to pick up
dinner for you kids.

06:14.274 --> 06:15.075
Great!

06:15.175 --> 06:16.143
Can we get Chipper Chicken?

06:16.243 --> 06:20.581
Well, you get happy
hamster for all I care.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.382
Just make sure that you
fold up all the clothes that

06:22.483 --> 06:25.318
are in the dryer, and then take
the garbage out to the curb,

06:25.419 --> 06:26.820
and make sure you
clean up the dishes.

06:26.920 --> 06:27.888
Sure, mom.
Bye.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.971
Take your books out of here
and put them up in your room.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.206
But dad, I'm going to do
my homework in here later.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.575
Pick them up now.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.710
I want this place cleaned up
before your mother gets home.

06:49.810 --> 06:50.911
Hello!

06:51.011 --> 06:52.746
Yeah, uh, give me a large
deluxe with everything,

06:52.846 --> 06:54.515
including anchovies.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.449
No anchovies.

It's yellow.

Yellow.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.427
OK, yeah, make that pineapple--
(FRUSTRATED) Yeah, I'll hold.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.697
Damn it!

pebbles some water.

- Ordering dinner.

07:33.821 --> 07:34.622
[mocking laugh]

07:34.722 --> 07:36.757
Oh, knock it off, both of you.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.226
Well, I see you wrote it down.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.494
You just didn't read it.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.394
I'm sorry, OK.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.630
I spaced out.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.397
Becky, I asked
you to do one thing

07:44.498 --> 07:47.668
and you didn't do any of them.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.436
You've got to learn
some responsibility.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.238
Here, I mean, you are
the oldest daughter.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.540
The second woman in command.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.008
You're the heiress
to my throne here.

07:55.108 --> 07:58.846
All right, I'll go
fold the royal underwear.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.013
Everything's under control.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.715
The pizza is on its way.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.216
Everything is cool.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.117
Ohm.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.455
This is a pretty picture.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.558
It's the one for school?

08:10.658 --> 08:14.227
There's daddy, and me,
and Becky, and you.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.629
Where's Darlene?

08:15.729 --> 08:17.130
Right there.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.498
That looks like
a bunch of flowers.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.399
I know.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.534
That's her grave.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.107
Hey, I heard
about the overtime.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.676
How long?
- I don't know.

08:28.776 --> 08:29.743
Two weeks maybe.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.613
Oh man, that's really
going to be tight.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.882
I've got to finish
roofing in that garage,

08:34.982 --> 08:36.917
plus I got two
driveways to pour,

08:37.017 --> 08:38.318
plus the wife says
they might have

08:38.418 --> 08:40.153
a drywall job lined up for me.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.955
Plus we've got
to live through it.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.557
Well, hopefully we will,
but it's really going

08:43.657 --> 08:45.158
to take some teamwork though.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.126
Hey, Becky, get in here.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.360
We've got to discuss something.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.461
Oh God.

08:48.562 --> 08:52.399
This ain't the Ward
Cleaver speech, is it?

08:52.499 --> 08:53.533
Hey, you guys.

08:53.634 --> 08:56.103
We've got a tough couple
of weeks coming up here.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.005
I'm going to be working
late, your mother's

08:58.105 --> 09:00.574
going on over time,
so that means you guys

09:00.674 --> 09:02.109
are going on over time too.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.376
In addition to your
regular chores,

09:03.476 --> 09:06.079
you're really going to have
to take up the slack here.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.547
DJ's wiping paint on me.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.515
DJ: No I'm not

09:08.616 --> 09:09.983
DJ, you know better than that.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.285
Don't anybody move.
Pebbles got loose.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.721
Oh, for crying out loud.

09:13.821 --> 09:14.688
Ew.

09:14.788 --> 09:15.789
BECKY: Oh, come here, baby.

09:15.889 --> 09:16.757
Ew.

09:16.857 --> 09:17.891
Get that little rat
back in the box.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.062
Ew.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.464
Why did I even think I could
get anything accomplished?

09:24.564 --> 09:27.267
Temporary insanity.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.871
Oh God, you stepped in some
pebbles of your own here, Dan.

09:30.971 --> 09:31.772
That's it.

09:31.872 --> 09:32.706
I give up!

09:36.176 --> 09:38.345
Well, you can't
give up, honey.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.447
All we need's a little
organization around here.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.849
We'll assign everybody chores.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.050
Yeah, we can make a list.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.918
I'll write it down.

09:45.018 --> 09:48.822
Spoken like a true
heiress to the throne here.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.190
All right, I'm ready.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.659
OK, rule number one.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.827
No painting in the house.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.462
And rule number two--

09:55.562 --> 09:58.365
No animals in the house.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.499
Rule number three, no--

09:59.599 --> 10:00.400
[boom]

10:00.500 --> 10:01.769
DJ: Mom!

10:01.869 --> 10:03.270
No children in the house.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.578
Well, at least we're going
to make a little extra money.

10:11.679 --> 10:12.780
That's what you think.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.648
I did some figuring last night.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.717
By the time I pay my
daytime babysitter,

10:16.817 --> 10:19.319
and then pay her extra to
drive my boy across town

10:19.419 --> 10:22.355
to the nighttime sitter, and
then pay for all gasoline,

10:22.455 --> 10:25.425
I figure this over time is
costing me a $1.25 an hour.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.394
Don't forget to
add in the guilt.

10:27.494 --> 10:28.662
Tell me about it.

10:28.762 --> 10:32.465
Yeah, isn't it awful feeling
like an absentee mother?

10:32.565 --> 10:33.366
Oh,

10:33.466 --> 10:34.334
[speaking spanish]

10:34.434 --> 10:35.635
Look who's here.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.271
Well, so glad you
could join us, sis.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.973
Well, thanks for having me.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.474
Well, I hope our
work's not getting

10:41.574 --> 10:42.642
in the way of your break.

10:42.743 --> 10:45.612
A little bit, but
hey, we're all family.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.514
Well, far be it from
us to stand in the way

10:47.614 --> 10:49.649
of your leisure time.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.384
Maybe we could start
coming in on the weekends

10:51.484 --> 10:52.619
to take up your slack.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.187
When I'm late,
at least I don't

10:54.287 --> 10:55.789
blame my husband and the kids.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.225
No, you make up
some outrageous lie.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.127
Hey, if I'm late
it's because I'm late.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.129
Well don't be and we'll
get out of here faster.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.096
That's right.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.232
I'm sick of working
all these hours.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.867
I'm sick of hearing
you whine about it.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.002
Well, just start working
and we'll stop whining.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.237
Get off of it!

11:10.337 --> 11:12.472
It's bad enough I got to
take that crap from Booker,

11:12.572 --> 11:13.974
I'm not going to take
it from you guys.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.109
Hey, knock off the
yelling in there.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.378
We're just practicing
the company cheer, Booker.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.750
What the hell is this?

11:22.850 --> 11:23.817
What?

11:23.917 --> 11:25.919
There's only two
prongs on these forks.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.855
Somebody didn't check
the metering gauge.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.222
All seven of these
cases are ruined!

11:29.322 --> 11:30.724
Who was on that gauge?

11:30.824 --> 11:32.392
- Jackie.
- Crystal.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.493
I did it the first hour.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.128
You were supposed to do it.
- No, I wasn't.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.529
- Yes you were.
- Don't blame me!

11:36.629 --> 11:37.731
Why not?
It's your fault!

11:37.831 --> 11:39.232
[screaming]

11:41.668 --> 11:42.469
There.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.404
I feel better now.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.239
The machine's all fixed.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.440
Let's resume work.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.809
All right, you're
going to have to make

11:48.909 --> 11:50.077
up these seven cases for me.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.311
We can do it tomorrow, Booker.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.479
No, you'll do it tonight.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.847
You all have an extra
hour of overtime.

11:53.947 --> 11:54.848
Nu-uh.
Give me a break!

11:54.948 --> 11:56.016
[GENERAL DISDAIN FROM ALL THE
WOMEN]

11:56.116 --> 11:58.385
You give me an extra set
of seven cases of forks

11:58.485 --> 11:59.286
and I'll give you one.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.327
I suppose you're going
to point the finger at me.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.796
Yeah, and you know which one.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.640
[cartoons playing on tv]

[door opens] I

12:23.276 --> 12:24.077
[slams shit]

12:24.177 --> 12:25.478
Hi, DJ.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.547
What are you doing?

12:27.647 --> 12:29.282
Never mind, I don't care.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.988
You know the rule is no
painting in the house.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.556
I wanted to watch TV.

12:36.656 --> 12:39.326
Well, you've got to fully
develop your brain first

12:39.426 --> 12:42.896
before you rot it out.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.332
Clean up your mess.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.699
Mom, where have you been?

12:46.800 --> 12:49.069
I was supposed to go over to
Diane's tonight and study.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.370
Diane who?

12:50.470 --> 12:53.006
Only my best friend
since kindergarten.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.174
Oh.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.308
Where is your daddy?

12:55.408 --> 12:57.077
He went to pick up
Darlene at band practice.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.011
Darlene who?

13:01.281 --> 13:02.349
Becky!

13:02.449 --> 13:04.717
There's paint all over the rug.

13:04.818 --> 13:07.654
Oh, Pebbles got loose and
ran across DJ's painting.

13:07.754 --> 13:08.922
Well, this paint
better come up

13:09.022 --> 13:13.093
or that pig's going to be
mounted about the fireplace.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.394
Don't worry, it's washable.

13:14.494 --> 13:19.232
Well, then wash it, and
find another place to live.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.133
But dad!

13:20.233 --> 13:21.434
Don't dad me, young lady.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.003
I don't want to
hear another word.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.037
Where have you been?

looking for your daughter.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.342
Mom, I couldn't help it.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.810
The band room was locked.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.312
For 45 minutes?

13:32.412 --> 13:33.346
I thought you were kidnapped.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.848
I wish I had been.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.050
Well, go up to your room
and leave the window open.

13:37.150 --> 13:37.951
Maybe you'll get lucky.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.155
Where were you?

13:42.255 --> 13:44.491
I had an extra
hour of overtime.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.425
Why didn't you call?

13:45.525 --> 13:46.626
I did.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.228
I tried three times but
the line was busy, Becky.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.832
This house is falling apart.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.134
What happened to
all those rules?

13:54.234 --> 13:56.236
They're hanging right there
on the refrigerator door.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.171
Well, they're not doing
us no good over there.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.372
Nobody's keeping them.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.308
Hey, at least I help
you clean up the kitchen.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.642
Oh, look.

14:02.742 --> 14:06.379
Oh, god-- why is it a guy can
hoist up a three ton truck

14:06.479 --> 14:08.648
to look for an oil leak, but
he can't lift a two ounce

14:08.748 --> 14:11.351
toaster to cleanup crumbs?

14:11.451 --> 14:13.286
Eh, nobody looks under there.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.055
Well, nobody looks
in your ears either,

14:15.155 --> 14:17.925
but you still clean
them, don't you?

14:18.025 --> 14:18.858
What?!

14:18.959 --> 14:19.792
[laughs]

14:19.893 --> 14:22.695
I knew you were
going to say that.

Well, so will the
ozone eventually.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.339
Hey, I do my part around here.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.274
It's more than
most guys would do.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.744
I do the cooking, the cleaning,
the laundry, plus I do my job.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.412
Do I get a word of thanks?

14:39.512 --> 14:41.114
No.

me no more honey.

I got in a fight
with Jackie, and then

14:49.122 --> 14:51.891
Crystal started crying, and--

14:51.992 --> 14:53.560
what did you wipe
up this table with?

14:53.660 --> 14:55.062
A dishrag.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.763
With what, jelly all over it?

14:56.863 --> 14:57.664
It was syrup.

15:00.968 --> 15:04.237
Oh, it'll burn off, I guess.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.639
All right, I'm going to
lock myself in the bathroom,

15:06.739 --> 15:10.110
and take a hot bath,
and slit my wrists.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.244
I'll get you
some clean towels.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.317

want to go in there.

going to come off the rug.

that spot remover.

before somebody gets hurt?

Ha!

15:40.907 --> 15:41.774

15:41.874 --> 15:42.875
All right, that's enough.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.477
That's enough.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.946
Dan, I'm walking
a fine line here.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.481
I've got to get out of
this house for a while.

15:48.581 --> 15:49.816
You go on.
Go, go, go.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.018
Go on, I'll clean it up.
Don't worry.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.252
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.086
Go on, honey.

15:53.186 --> 15:53.786
I'll take care of everything.

I know.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.340
We're closed.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.907
Well the sign says 10 o'clock.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.409
It is 10 o'clock.

still got eight minutes.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.214
Well, my feet
say we're closed.

all her life, and
you know what it's

overtime, come home, and see

16:27.420 --> 16:28.988
your house all turned
up by three kids,

16:29.089 --> 16:31.691
and have your old man yap
about how he does more

16:31.791 --> 16:34.327
than any other guy he knows,
and I need a cup of coffee

16:34.427 --> 16:36.863
real bad.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.198
The coffee's cold.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.832
That's fine.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.534
Oh, all right.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.436
I got to do my clean up anyway.

Bless you.

16:44.471 --> 16:45.672
Ha!

16:45.772 --> 16:49.042
If I was blessed I wouldn't
be working in this joint.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.711
Well, I bet you I hate my
job worse than you hate yours.

16:51.811 --> 16:52.612
Oh yeah?

16:52.712 --> 16:54.181
What do you do?

16:54.281 --> 16:55.882
I rob dimers.

16:55.982 --> 16:58.051
No.

16:58.151 --> 17:01.254
I print out plastic
all day in the factory.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.257
Paradise compared
to this hell pit.

17:04.357 --> 17:08.328
My other waitress quit
during the dinner rush,

17:08.428 --> 17:10.963
and I had an argument
with the dishwasher,

17:11.064 --> 17:14.567
and as an added bonus, eight
square dances came in here,

17:14.667 --> 17:20.107
spent three hours, and
left me a $0.78 tip.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.309
Hey, I always wondered
how these things reproduced.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.210
[chuckles]

17:23.310 --> 17:24.577
It's loads of fun.

17:24.677 --> 17:27.080
Hey, let me ask you something.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.748
Do you ever have
to work overtime?

17:28.848 --> 17:31.284
Honey, my whole
life is overtime.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.452
Yeah, I know what you mean.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.020
I've got to check
in the hospital just

17:34.121 --> 17:35.988
to get a vacation.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.425
As long as it isn't
the maternity ward.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.627
Well, that's the truth.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.130
Could you possibly
heat this up?

17:43.230 --> 17:43.996
Help yourself.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.933
Microwave's right over there.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.000
You know what?

17:48.101 --> 17:49.769
I feel like I've been
thrown in a river,

17:49.869 --> 17:54.807
and handed some boulders,
and told to swim upstream.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.476
And it seems you know,
the harder I swim,

17:56.576 --> 17:58.778
the more boulders they hand me.

17:58.878 --> 18:03.150
Honey, wait till you
try it with arthritis.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.017
Yeah, but you've got
to keep swimming, right?

18:05.118 --> 18:08.020
Because that's what
all of us women do.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.189
Just keep swimming.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.691
Ain't that the truth.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.093
You know what I used
to do when I was a kid?

18:14.194 --> 18:15.528
I'd leave the lid
off these things

18:15.628 --> 18:18.030
and leave it for the next
customer real loose like.

18:18.131 --> 18:18.931
[chuckles]

18:19.031 --> 18:22.034
I still do.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.636
You know what else
I do when things

18:23.736 --> 18:25.104
get a little tense around here?

18:25.205 --> 18:26.072
What?

18:26.173 --> 18:28.941
I deep fry a couple
of dish towels.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.578
Oh, that's great.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.146
I hardly cook at all anymore.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.547
[laughs]

18:37.517 --> 18:39.219
You married?

18:39.319 --> 18:40.720
I was.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.590
My Marvin passed away
about seven years ago.

18:43.690 --> 18:46.359
Mm, sorry to hear that.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.727
I miss him.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.829
He was a good man.

18:49.929 --> 18:53.566
Hardest part is going home
at night to an empty house.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.303
It's so damn quiet.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.738
You know, Sometimes I
turn on the ball game,

18:58.838 --> 19:04.244
and turn it up real loud like he
used to do, and I hate sports.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.212
But what are you going to do?

19:09.216 --> 19:15.455
(SINGING) Sometimes
it's hard to be a woman.

19:15.555 --> 19:21.294
Of giving all your
love to one man.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.695
[imitating music]

19:23.863 --> 19:24.664
Hey you!

19:24.764 --> 19:26.433
Hey you.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.468
Boy, this house
looks immaculate.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.436
You didn't have to do it.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.503
I would have helped.

19:30.603 --> 19:31.404
Oh, that's OK.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.705
I saved the bathroom for you.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.508
Oh, then you
really do love me.

19:35.608 --> 19:36.776
Here.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.411
Thank you.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.979
Where'd you find a
flower this time of night?

19:40.079 --> 19:42.482
The cemetery.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.284
Picking out my plot, ey?

19:44.384 --> 19:47.387
No, I was over at this little
coffee shop on eighth street.

19:47.487 --> 19:51.524
The best day old
coffee in the world.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.492
Feeling better?

19:52.592 --> 19:53.793
Much.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.563
Well, that's good because
this paint ain't coming out.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.997
Eh, Forget. about it.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.500
We'll just move.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.936
Hey, is that DJ's picture?
- Yeah.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.239
That's the one he's
turning in at school.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.641
Look at the size of that sun.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.176
Oh, he's really into yellow.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.344
Kind of like you and corn.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.979
Yeah.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.947
Check out those flowers.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.784
Kind of nice you can see
some pretty in all this mess.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.886
I'm just glad Darlene's
alive in this one.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.088
[sighs]
Hey.

20:22.188 --> 20:23.256
Mm?

20:23.356 --> 20:24.857
Did you make up our bed?

20:24.957 --> 20:27.294
Yes, ma'am.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.597
Well, let's go unmake it.

20:30.697 --> 20:33.966
Sure you're not too tired?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.968
Never.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.704
Well, all right.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.506
Let's go.

20:39.606 --> 20:40.473
OK, I'm going.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.374
Me too.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.144
[exhales]

20:45.244 --> 20:46.846
All right.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.115
Count of three.

20:49.215 --> 20:55.087
One, two, three.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.723
Was it good for you?

20:56.823 --> 20:57.624
I'm spent.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.096
Dan?

21:04.196 --> 21:04.997
Yeah?

21:05.097 --> 21:06.699
Did you set that alarm?

21:06.799 --> 21:08.601
No.

21:08.701 --> 21:09.502
Well, you better.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.703
You'll oversleep.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.405
I don't care.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.474
I'm not going to work tomorrow.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.276
I'm entitled to a little R&R.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.446
Well, if you're not
going, I ain't going.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.448
Fine.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.750
Yeah.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.319
I think I'll sleep
till noon, and then

21:26.419 --> 21:31.724
I'll go in and leisurely read
the paper, and sip my coffee.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.494
Then I might come back
to bed and take a nap.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.396
Me too.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.864
So we're agreed then?

21:37.964 --> 21:39.466
Agreed.

21:39.566 --> 21:40.367
Great.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.906
Dan?

21:47.006 --> 21:48.274
Is the alarm set?

21:48.375 --> 21:49.809
Yeah.
