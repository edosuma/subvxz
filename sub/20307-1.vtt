WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:02.627
JENKINS: Item six.

00:02.711 --> 00:05.130
Housing Authority is on my case, people.

00:05.922 --> 00:08.049
Put sector-B patrols up profile

00:08.133 --> 00:10.677
at the Clark
redevelopment construction site.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.596
Pop who's ever been stealing the bricks.

00:14.514 --> 00:18.143
Seven, ongoings and undercovers.

00:18.226 --> 00:20.478
Tour units are alerted
for Muller and Crane.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.188
Clark's at the M.L. King.

00:22.272 --> 00:25.442
And Dragan and Zachary, junkies
in the stop-and-cop block.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.945
And Detective Belker's
at the Wolfing Gardens.

00:29.529 --> 00:33.491
He's after that cat burglar
that's been mauling the residents there.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.036
-Not something I wanna do.
-Item eight.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.830
Memo from Division Commander Svenson.

00:38.913 --> 00:42.542
Re: personnel experiencing illness

00:42.625 --> 00:45.086
the day prior to starting their vacation.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.505
(everyone laughs)

00:47.589 --> 00:48.798
Lieutenant?

00:50.550 --> 00:53.011
Noise complaint on the S.O.I.L. house.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.180
Get O'Brien and Phillips
when they come up, okay?

00:55.263 --> 00:56.806
-Okay.
-Hang on.

00:57.557 --> 01:00.143
I think there's a "notify officer"
on this address.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.355
(telephone rings)

01:04.439 --> 01:05.523
Schwartzman.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.609
Belker!

01:09.027 --> 01:11.279
He ain't here. Excuse me?

01:12.113 --> 01:14.199
Uh... Ma'am, he ain't here.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.993
Uh... This is Hill Street.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.288
Well, I'm sorry if my voice
doesn't sound familiar.

01:20.371 --> 01:21.873
(indistinct male voice)

01:21.956 --> 01:24.417
Well, if that's who you are,
then you ought to know, he...

01:24.501 --> 01:27.420
(stammering)

01:27.504 --> 01:28.797
Is this urgent?

01:28.880 --> 01:30.924
(indistinct chattering)

01:31.007 --> 01:35.303
All right, if I see him,
I will let him know.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.931
Yes, I'm leaving a message.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.851
You were dizzy,
but you're feeling better now.

01:42.936 --> 01:47.315
You love him,
and it's gonna cool off tonight,

01:47.398 --> 01:50.151
so he doesn't need to leave
the air conditioner on.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.320
That's it?

01:53.071 --> 01:54.280
That's the message?

01:54.948 --> 01:56.616
(stammering)

01:56.699 --> 01:59.410
Mrs. Belker, he ain't here.
This is night shift.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.663
Yeah, Lieutenant Goldblume.

02:01.746 --> 02:05.875
You got a "please notify"
on 1416 Clarendon?

02:05.959 --> 02:08.294
These S.O.I.L. house people?

02:08.378 --> 02:11.005
-Hi.
-Hi. Are we off?

02:11.089 --> 02:13.424
You're being awfully good
about this dinner, Furillo.

02:13.508 --> 02:16.302
-I could say you got the plague.
-Thought we already used that one.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.847
Could we make an early exit, though?
I'm bushed.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.765
You have my solemn vow, darling.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.768
Me and Robert will be finished
no later than 11:15.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.604
Yes, ma'am, I love you, too.

02:27.689 --> 02:28.940
You're my alibi, Bobby.

02:29.023 --> 02:32.360
Serious overtime
on the trial deposition, Daryl Ann.

02:32.443 --> 02:33.695
All that paperwork.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.989
Right, he didn't go spending no 100 bucks

02:36.072 --> 02:38.658
to meet some country-western
singer backstage.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.118
-No, sir.
-Wait a minute.

02:40.201 --> 02:43.997
Bobby Angel ain't just some
country-and-western singer.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.165
-He--
-Renko?

02:45.248 --> 02:48.001
-This guy's got a delivery.
-Yes, sir.

02:48.084 --> 02:51.129
WGZZ "meet the man" contest number 14?

02:51.212 --> 02:54.382
-Yes, sir. Andrew J. Renko!
-Benjamin Franklin.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.178
Well, you must be a real
country fan, mister,

02:58.261 --> 03:00.471
knowing all them facts about
Bobby's life like that.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.057
I wouldn't know Bobby Angel
from "Charlie's Angels," pal.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.142
I'm a ticket broker.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.227
We bought this from the guy who won.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.897
Get backstage, you ask for Bear.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.023
Bear.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.901
Well, I know,
as a responsible human husband,

03:12.984 --> 03:14.944
I should be suffering
deep budgetary remorse.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.155
But right now, you're looking
at one happy cowboy!

03:17.238 --> 03:18.823
Beg her before the show, cowboy?

03:18.907 --> 03:20.617
-Uh-huh.
-(laughs)

03:20.700 --> 03:22.577
MAN: No, I can't. I'm getting off tonight.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.246
I'm going on days tomorrow morning.
I think 0800.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.999
WOMAN (on phone):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:28.082 --> 03:30.168
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

03:30.251 --> 03:34.130
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of Peoples Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:40.929 --> 03:44.349
(theme music playing)

04:57.880 --> 05:01.551
This thief's scaring
these old people so bad,

05:01.634 --> 05:03.636
I'm afraid someone is gonna die.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.431
Other night,
he came into a lady's living room

05:06.514 --> 05:09.100
-right through the ceiling.
-No garage.

05:09.183 --> 05:11.644
Not in this old place.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.188
No garbage chute.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.567
Now, he either goes through there
or up the fire escape.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.785
Nasty stakeout.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.662
I've done a lot of dumpsters before.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.788
This ain't so bad.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.249
I'm on a 2-hour circuit.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.751
See you in a couple hours.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.919
-Holler if you need me.
-Will do.

05:41.591 --> 05:42.800
-COFFEY: J.D.
-LARUE: Hmm?

05:42.884 --> 05:44.927
You still staying
at your brother-in-law's?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.721
-Till tomorrow, yeah.
-Yeah. Renko says

05:46.804 --> 05:49.307
the fastest way to get to work
from there is Clifford Avenue.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.725
-Mm-mm. Portland.
-See?

05:50.808 --> 05:53.311
That's right, Andy.
Portland's got the no left 6 to 9.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.396
You guys talk pretty big
for people ain't lived

05:55.480 --> 05:57.398
in the same neighborhood
like I have for 8 years.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.817
It takes me 20 minutes to get to work.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.028
But you only live on 87th.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.280
Hey, it takes me 20. I leave at 6:25.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.199
-You lie.
-I lie, Renko?

06:06.282 --> 06:08.743
I lie about a lot of stuff,
not about when I leave for work.

06:08.826 --> 06:11.788
You mean, wait a minute now.
You mean Portland from Heights Circle

06:11.871 --> 06:14.582
-a straight shot up to Maplewood?
-Right. 6:25.

06:14.665 --> 06:17.418
Robert, I think I'm gonna be able
to finance my backstage visit.

06:17.502 --> 06:22.423
Okay, $100, you and me,
says Renko's route is faster.

06:22.507 --> 06:23.925
Portland to Hudson to Decker?

06:24.008 --> 06:25.885
-Renko--
-That's right. That's right.

06:25.968 --> 06:28.388
Portland to Hudson to Decker.
Okay? We got a wager?

06:28.471 --> 06:31.724
6:25 tomorrow morning,
you take your route, I'll take mine.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.936
-A yard? Oh, you got it?
-You got it. Okay, seconds in the car

06:35.019 --> 06:37.730
-verifying route and speed limit.
-Right.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.440
-Bobby, you be my second?

06:39.524 --> 06:40.775
I'm not gonna get up at 6:00--

06:40.858 --> 06:44.195
Hey, Tony, get the board for the series.
Victory margin, total time?

06:44.278 --> 06:46.114
Don't go south on me now, brother.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.741
Now, Lieutenant,
would you please be the referee?

06:48.825 --> 06:51.828
-Referee? You've got a contest?
-No, it's not a contest. It's not a bet.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.080
It's just somebody
making a charitable contribution

06:54.163 --> 06:56.374
to the Andrew J. Renko
budget-balancing campaign.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.751
Time for the campaign, okay?
Time for the concert.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.002
I'll talk to you later.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.046
Where you gonna get the money,
Rockefeller?

07:02.130 --> 07:04.799
Full faith in the credit
of Parnelli J. Renko.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.717
-(imitates engine)
-(chuckles)

07:06.801 --> 07:10.346
(polka plays)

07:10.430 --> 07:11.472
Mmm.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.333
Don't start with me, Blackie.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.418
(sighs)

07:43.254 --> 07:44.839
Blackie, don't start with me!

07:48.092 --> 07:49.010
All right.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.012
Okay.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.349
But you know you with <i>weisswurst</i>.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.859
MAN: Uh-uh-uh. Where's your mask?

08:05.568 --> 08:06.903
What's that supposed to mean?

08:07.612 --> 08:11.741
Oh. Sorry. I thought
you were one of my students.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.076
We've been mixing vanadium stains.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.786
-It's very toxic.
-Well, I heard

08:15.870 --> 08:19.290
that you sometimes let people,
I mean, hobbyists...

08:19.874 --> 08:22.502
who aren't students
use the school kiln, so...

08:22.585 --> 08:23.753
Sure. What you got?

08:24.378 --> 08:26.214
Well... it's rough stuff.

08:26.297 --> 08:29.759
Uh... The pots I made on a kitchen table.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.678
Coil pot, slab pot with weaving.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.180
That's very ambitious.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.015
And...

08:37.016 --> 08:39.810
Uh, I bought
the unfinished horse, you know,

08:39.894 --> 08:41.521
painted it with this china glaze.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.731
And it's for a kid I know.

08:43.814 --> 08:47.652
(chuckles) Very nice work.
Well, this will fire about three hours.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.071
Of course,
the pots will take a lot longer.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.241
Well, if it doesn't matter to you,

08:53.324 --> 08:55.034
I would like to wait for that horse.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.410
Is that possible?

08:56.494 --> 08:59.413
I mean, tomorrow's the kid's birthday,
so it's...

08:59.497 --> 09:00.873
Did you bring a book?

09:00.957 --> 09:02.667
What kind of book was I supposed to bring?

09:02.750 --> 09:05.002
No, just something so you could kill time.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.296
Oh, I'm not gonna get bored,

09:07.380 --> 09:10.174
and I'm not gonna drive you crazy either
with a bunch of questions.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.592
What's your name?

09:11.676 --> 09:14.345
-Lucy Bates.
-Tom Hopper.

09:14.428 --> 09:15.972
Hi. How are you?

09:16.889 --> 09:17.765
Whoo! (chuckles)

09:17.848 --> 09:20.351
-(recording of man speaking)
-MAN: You from the police?

09:20.434 --> 09:21.894
(woman screaming, indistinct)

09:21.978 --> 09:24.981
MAN: Ain't no way we can live
with this noise! They got to go!

09:25.064 --> 09:26.482
WOMAN: Living in there like pigs!

09:26.566 --> 09:29.277
I live way down at the bottom,
and I can smell the garbage.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.698
(yelling) Hello, Calvin!

09:34.365 --> 09:36.200
What happened to our agreement?!

09:36.284 --> 09:38.369
MAN (on recording):
<i>...The stories of our people</i>

09:38.452 --> 09:40.329
<i>that have their names</i>
<i>taken away from them.</i>

09:42.415 --> 09:47.003
(yelling) No volume over 60 decibels!

09:47.086 --> 09:50.214
No speeches after 5:00!

09:50.298 --> 09:52.300
MAN (on recording): <i>How do you get a name?</i>

09:52.383 --> 09:54.802
<i>How do you go about claiming</i>
<i>what ought to be yours...</i>

09:54.885 --> 09:55.720
Calvin!

09:56.721 --> 10:00.141
I didn't come here to shout!
I came to talk!

10:00.224 --> 10:02.268
MAN (on recording): <i>You can claim it in...</i>

10:02.351 --> 10:05.146
<i>You can claim it in money or automobiles</i>

10:05.229 --> 10:07.815
<i>or with a herd of sheep or 40</i>
<i>acres you farm...</i>

10:07.898 --> 10:09.191
(volume lowers)

10:09.275 --> 10:13.070
(crowd cheers)

10:14.071 --> 10:15.781
<i>You can take away my family.</i>

10:15.865 --> 10:18.200
<i>You can spread my family so far...</i>

10:20.786 --> 10:23.539
My commander screened for most sounds.

10:27.376 --> 10:28.753
I used to be so laid-back,

10:28.836 --> 10:32.465
but now I have to take
every measure of security.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.175
You know what I mean?

10:34.258 --> 10:36.052
Not really. Why is that?

10:36.135 --> 10:39.889
Well, there's been betrayals
from several directions,

10:39.972 --> 10:43.059
and I'm trying now to determine

10:43.142 --> 10:45.770
whether or not
if you knew anything about it.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.732
The only thing I know about
is a noise complaint.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.193
Well, we have information

10:53.027 --> 10:55.655
about tomorrow's Housing
Coalition meeting.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.950
The S.O.I.L. will receive

11:00.034 --> 11:03.329
no apartment allotment

11:04.330 --> 11:05.873
in the Clark Redevelopment.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.628
Thought that came out last month.

11:10.711 --> 11:14.674
(sighs) Oh, it's... it's impossible.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.305
-This conspiracy...
-MAN: <i>...Stories of our people</i>

11:21.389 --> 11:23.432
<i>that have their names</i>
<i>taken away from them.</i>

11:23.516 --> 11:27.186
-...leaves me with nothing, man. I mean...
-Whoa, whoa!

11:28.187 --> 11:31.482
-What conspiracy?
-You know. (chuckles)

11:31.565 --> 11:32.733
You were out there.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.110
No, I don't know.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.153
You, you carry a gun.

11:37.071 --> 11:37.905
I'm a cop.

11:39.907 --> 11:40.991
I know you are.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.244
-And I know why you're here.
-Calvin.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.079
I have to have your weapon, Henry.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.914
Well, I won't give it to you, Calvin.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.754
Guards! I need my guards in here.

11:53.838 --> 11:54.922
This is not smart.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.590
I don't have any choices.

11:57.967 --> 12:01.387
I want this man disarmed.
I'm asking for his weapon.

12:02.430 --> 12:06.350
Fire on him only if he refuses me.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.519
Please don't force me!

12:09.395 --> 12:12.857
I'm trying, Henry.
I'm trying to keep my balance.

12:12.940 --> 12:15.943
MAN (on recording):
<i>...Can't take away my name...</i>

12:16.026 --> 12:18.571
<i>And if I say my name,</i>
<i>you better be careful...</i>

12:26.662 --> 12:29.957
-(man speaking indistinctly)
-In case anybody's counting calories,

12:30.040 --> 12:32.501
the sauce is made
with whipped cottage cheese

12:32.585 --> 12:33.627
instead of sour cream.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.880
That looks fabulous, but I'm afraid

12:35.963 --> 12:39.925
it's a little too late to undo
the pastrami sandwiches, huh?

12:40.009 --> 12:42.219
The staple diet of the public defender.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.681
I thought we'd switch to a Montrachet,

12:45.765 --> 12:49.518
a little more body, but still
the unmistakable laughter

12:49.602 --> 12:52.521
-of a peasant girl in the bouquet.
-(man laughs)

12:52.605 --> 12:55.524
Now that I've met the Furillos,
I have a suggestion for Frank.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.027
-What's that?
-Get that gorgeous wife of yours

12:58.110 --> 12:59.987
out of the public defender's office.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.530
I just got back into it.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.115
WOMAN: I mean, don't you miss her?

13:03.199 --> 13:04.700
Get her home for dinner.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.661
She usually is home for dinner.
I'm the one who's usually late.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.456
Really? That's an interesting tidbit.

13:10.539 --> 13:11.999
Honey, our duty hours overlap.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.001
I sometimes work late
when Joyce doesn't work.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.462
My understanding is that
the whole damned office

13:16.545 --> 13:19.089
works till damn near midnight
every single night.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.051
At least that's what Jim tells me.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.803
What about it? You gonna back him up?

13:23.886 --> 13:26.263
Actually, I'm a D.A., Mrs. McNeil.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.517
No question we all work
some pretty long hours, though.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.395
Well, I have a confession to make.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.606
Want to hear my confession, big Jim?

13:35.689 --> 13:37.024
Honey, please, huh?

13:37.107 --> 13:40.069
Your pals can stick up for you
as much as they like.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.445
I already know about her.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.490
I even know what she does for you.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.992
None of you know <i>that!</i>

13:47.701 --> 13:48.953
I hired a dick.

13:49.036 --> 13:52.164
Jim's got a little hooker,
feeds him dog food.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.334
(pager beeps)

13:55.417 --> 13:58.963
-Sorry. Uh...
-Phone's in the living room.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.841
The guy took pictures
with a telephoto lens.

14:01.924 --> 14:06.470
Jim's down on all fours,
the tramp's feeding him kibble,

14:06.554 --> 14:08.556
and this <i>twisto </i>is lapping it up.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.140
Rosie, shut your mouth!

14:10.224 --> 14:13.227
ROSIE: (laughs) He's kicking me
under the table!

14:13.310 --> 14:15.396
Go ahead, smack me in front of the cop.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.566
-I dare ya. Lay it on, big Jim!
-All right, that's it.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.651
I'm gonna dump you.
I'm gonna dump you so hard!

14:20.734 --> 14:21.986
You're in the street, you cow!

14:22.069 --> 14:24.738
My attorney's gonna pinch your head off.
(laughs)

14:24.822 --> 14:26.490
You think so, huh?!

14:30.327 --> 14:31.912
I got $20,000 stashed away.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.956
You're not gonna find a nickel.
Not a penny!

14:34.039 --> 14:36.000
Sorry, folks, police business.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.170
Is my car blocking yours?

14:41.505 --> 14:43.757
Will someone who's leaving walk Jim?

14:44.675 --> 14:46.010
COFFEY: Okay, you got it.

14:47.011 --> 14:50.097
Sandusky bets Renko?
That's why you're broke, Otto.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.557
Hey, don't listen to him.

14:54.351 --> 14:56.145
Gretchen! Sweetheart, over here.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.439
Oh, you look wonderful.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.190
Mm. Good to see you.

15:00.274 --> 15:04.612
Gee, this looks like a lot more fun
than Carmine's and a movie.

15:04.695 --> 15:07.156
I'm bank for an extremely
important challenge race here,

15:07.239 --> 15:08.449
and I can't leave my post.

15:08.532 --> 15:11.201
Come on, have some supper.
And don't be so smart with me.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.662
Mrs. S., my tab. Bobby, you know Gretchen?

15:13.746 --> 15:15.748
Hey, fellas,
there's a commotion on the lot.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.418
It's 9:11 Mrs. Scalisi, I'm enjoying
this wonderful meat loaf.

15:19.501 --> 15:20.461
I'm only saying that

15:20.544 --> 15:23.088
on account of they're
near yours and Joe's cars.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.341
REPORTER: <i>We interrupt</i>
<i>our regular programming</i>

15:25.424 --> 15:27.384
<i>to bring you this special news bulletin.</i>

15:27.468 --> 15:30.888
<i>We have a situation developing</i>
<i>in the city's Hill District.</i>

15:30.971 --> 15:33.891
<i>Let's go now to Bob</i>
<i>on the scene with a report.</i>

15:34.683 --> 15:35.976
(metal hitting the floor)

15:36.060 --> 15:37.811
Okay now! You're out now! Okay?

15:37.895 --> 15:40.981
I'll call Mr. Fitz in the morning,
and you're finished in this building!

15:41.065 --> 15:42.816
Chief Mr. Super gonna call the landlord!

15:42.900 --> 15:44.318
Yeah, well, how do you like this?

15:44.401 --> 15:47.988
(all shouting)

15:48.072 --> 15:49.990
Just cool it, all right, fellas? Cool it!

15:50.074 --> 15:51.742
Jerk put my dog in a washing machine.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.161
Dog went on my floor.
He needs to be cleaned up!

15:54.244 --> 15:56.789
Okay, okay. Did he start
the washing machine?

15:56.872 --> 15:57.748
No. No way.

15:57.831 --> 16:00.250
Oh, no, but you left the animal
in there, didn't you?!

16:00.334 --> 16:02.086
(all shouting)

16:02.169 --> 16:03.671
Shut up now!

16:03.754 --> 16:06.006
Hey! We're inside. We're eating.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.384
We're trying to have a nice,
peaceful meal.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.512
Now you, you stay away from the dog.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.263
And you, you clean up the garbage.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.848
And nobody touch the cars.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.393
<i>-The man with a reputation...</i>
-Go on.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.187
Ah, shut up with your loudmouth bragging.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.855
<i>Let me tell everyone looking...</i>

16:21.939 --> 16:24.692
You're gonna be bragging
out of the other side of your mouth

16:24.775 --> 16:26.735
when you get in the ring
with Johnny Hurricane.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.446
<i>It ain't gonna happen!</i>

16:29.530 --> 16:30.739
A bunch of damn nonsense.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.617
REPORTER: <i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>for a special news bulletin.</i>

16:33.701 --> 16:36.120
<i>Situation developing</i>
<i>in the city's Hill District.</i>

16:36.203 --> 16:38.622
(horn honking)

16:38.706 --> 16:40.165
(tires screech)

16:40.249 --> 16:41.333
I'll walk.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.504
Congratulations on the gridlock.

16:45.587 --> 16:46.797
Chief.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.632
All right, how did they get Goldblume?

16:48.716 --> 16:50.009
There was a noise complaint.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.386
Henry went over to ask them
to turn down the speakers.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.347
Captain. We finally got records access.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.725
Matthias has a long history
of depressive illness.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.394
He stopped the lithium maintenance
program eight months ago.

17:00.477 --> 17:02.146
MATTHIAS: <i>I demand acknowledgment.</i>

17:03.480 --> 17:05.274
<i>I want to know I've been heard.</i>

17:06.233 --> 17:08.736
-Just a minute, Calvin.
-What's he talking about?

17:08.819 --> 17:11.196
MATTHIAS:
<i>Do you have so much contempt for a man</i>

17:11.280 --> 17:13.449
<i>who came here by professional choice?</i>

17:14.658 --> 17:17.786
-He wants face-to-face negotiation.
-Excuse us now.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.330
Pretty cute, huh?

17:20.414 --> 17:23.000
The man's losing clout,
so he choreographs a confrontation.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.961
-I don't think this was choreographed.
-We're not giving an inch, Frank.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.422
Brother Calvin is not gonna
rehabilitate his reputation

17:28.505 --> 17:30.799
-through blackmail.
-I don't disagree with that.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.052
I also don't want to issue
ultimatums here.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.261
I want to get Henry out.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.096
MATTHIAS:<i> You're assassinating him.</i>

17:38.265 --> 17:40.601
-Calvin--
-Go ahead and meet with the lunatic

17:40.684 --> 17:42.102
if you think it's appropriate.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.105
MATTHIAS: <i>Do I get the sit-down, Captain?</i>
<i>Yes or no?</i>

17:45.189 --> 17:47.316
Yes. Yes.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.525
Thank you.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.913
(humming)

18:11.006 --> 18:14.635
(siren wails in distance)

18:24.144 --> 18:26.063
(sniffs)

18:35.280 --> 18:37.783
-(man vomits)
-Bobby, come on out, man.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.368
You got people out here for you.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.455
-You okay, son?
-(toilet flushes)

18:43.539 --> 18:44.998
(sighs)

18:47.626 --> 18:50.420
Hey, there! Bobby Angel.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.551
Yes, sir. Andrew J. Renko, sir.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.303
Andy, is this the little wife?

18:58.387 --> 19:01.306
-No, sir.
-Dora Jean Saperstein, Mr. Angel.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.433
Well, if you two ain't married,

19:03.517 --> 19:07.104
-give me a big, old kiss, Dora Jean.
-(sighs, chuckles)

19:07.187 --> 19:09.273
(country music playing)

19:09.356 --> 19:10.649
Ah!

19:10.732 --> 19:13.318
Well, let's sit down here and get homey.

19:15.237 --> 19:19.158
So you won the chance
to set a spell with me, huh?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.118
So what kind of contest was it?

19:21.201 --> 19:22.911
Facts about your life, Bobby.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.037
Facts about <i>my </i>life?!

19:24.121 --> 19:27.291
Ha ha ha ha! You hear that, Bear?

19:27.374 --> 19:29.042
Well, I bet you don't know why

19:29.126 --> 19:31.003
that this hombre
sitting here in front of you

19:31.086 --> 19:33.881
is known as "big Bobby"
by every gal he ever knew!

19:35.382 --> 19:37.968
Well, I don't know, but I sure
am willing to learn.

19:38.051 --> 19:41.221
Wow-ee! Come and tie my yippy to a tree!

19:41.305 --> 19:43.390
Ha ha ha ha ha! Sit down, Andy!

19:43.473 --> 19:45.267
Give her a drink of that.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.811
Excuse me while I put in my damn contacts.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.647
-Yes, sir.
-And, Bear, get me a setup, will you?

19:50.731 --> 19:53.859
(choking)

19:53.942 --> 19:56.737
Pat her on the back.
Don't let her die on us.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.114
Well, what do you do, Andrew?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.824
Uh, well, sir--

20:00.908 --> 20:03.744
Oh, forget about the sir.
The name is Bobby.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.037
Go on, use it.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.873
-Bobby--
-Bobby.

20:07.956 --> 20:11.752
Well, uh, I tell you...
of course I have a job,

20:11.835 --> 20:15.422
but the number-one thing
and love in my life,

20:15.505 --> 20:18.091
besides my wife and child,
is country music--

20:18.175 --> 20:20.177
country music played from the soul.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.055
And I think your music
personifies all that is best

20:23.138 --> 20:24.473
in the American character.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.100
Oh, my God.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.519
(inhaling)

20:30.854 --> 20:32.856
Go on, Andrew. I ain't missing a word.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.609
No, I-I just came to watch.

20:35.692 --> 20:38.195
Why? You had a swig. You ain't temperate.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.030
It's just something I can't see, sir.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.157
Well, I respect your wishes, Andrew.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.911
We got to respect the church
folks there, Norma Jean.

20:46.703 --> 20:49.122
Well, it's safe. You can turn around now.

20:50.707 --> 20:51.792
(inhaling)

20:51.875 --> 20:52.918
Oh, my God.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.629
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Fooled you!

20:56.755 --> 20:59.383
You know, you shouldn't
ought have done that, Bobby.

20:59.925 --> 21:00.968
Well, why is that?

21:04.596 --> 21:08.267
I have taken a solemn vow
that I cannot break.

21:10.310 --> 21:11.395
(laughs)

21:11.478 --> 21:13.647
Wow! Why is he getting weird on us?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.149
Don't go away mad, Hoss!

21:16.233 --> 21:19.278
(country music plays)

21:21.738 --> 21:23.073
Uh, excuse me.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.326
(sighs)

21:26.785 --> 21:29.788
Andrew J. Renko, Hill Street Precinct.

21:29.871 --> 21:32.165
We got a narcotics possession in there.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.834
Not the man?

21:33.917 --> 21:35.502
Yeah, afraid so.

21:35.585 --> 21:37.713
You're gonna have to make the collar.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.381
That breaks my heart.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.508
Breaks mine, too.

21:47.681 --> 21:50.142
See these surveillance photos, Chief?

21:50.225 --> 21:52.936
Interesting combination
of armament and animal husbandry

21:53.020 --> 21:54.313
on that building's roof.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.524
You know, Howard,

21:58.400 --> 22:01.737
if this meeting between
the captain and Matthias isn't productive,

22:02.612 --> 22:05.490
I would be very interested
in hearing your suggestions.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.367
I'd be delighted to oblige.

22:14.041 --> 22:17.544
They've got Henry trussed up
like a Christmas pig.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.756
Are you all right, Henry?

22:20.839 --> 22:22.466
Dynamite outfit, huh, Frank?

22:24.134 --> 22:25.635
We got Henry all duked up.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.305
Same decor inside.

22:29.097 --> 22:31.099
Wanna tell the captain
we have dynamite inside?

22:31.183 --> 22:32.726
We have dynamite inside, Captain.

22:32.809 --> 22:35.645
-Okay, Henry? Message delivered.
-What do you want?

22:35.729 --> 22:37.689
Listen, I had no intention
of taking this man.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.566
This man appeared
out of a series of events

22:39.649 --> 22:41.193
that now have taken control of me.

22:41.276 --> 22:44.071
I believe that.
I think this just happened.

22:44.154 --> 22:46.156
And I don't want to see it
get out of hand, Calvin.

22:46.239 --> 22:48.116
Are you trying to tell me
that I have enemies?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.993
That people want to see me undone?

22:50.660 --> 22:52.579
Let Lieutenant Goldblume go.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.164
Let's back away from this.

22:54.247 --> 22:56.208
What are you offering? Immunity?

22:56.291 --> 22:57.751
The terms have to be my terms.

22:57.834 --> 23:01.213
They have to be my terms
because I am now a man without choice.

23:01.296 --> 23:04.341
Try to listen. What would get
the lieutenant released?

23:05.092 --> 23:07.386
I have promises, obligations.

23:07.469 --> 23:08.637
What are they?

23:08.720 --> 23:10.806
I need several millions of dollars,

23:10.889 --> 23:13.100
and transportation to Nicaragua.

23:13.183 --> 23:16.144
Asking for that kind of money and a plane

23:16.937 --> 23:19.356
turns this into something
different, Calvin.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.692
-Are you threatening me?
-I'm not threatening you.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.738
These are my demands.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.408
Since I rid myself
of a chemical conspiracy,

23:29.491 --> 23:31.451
I've been having trouble getting sleep.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.161
I don't know what time you call it,

23:33.245 --> 23:37.165
but I see the sunrise behind that building

23:37.249 --> 23:39.292
every morning.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.547
I guarantee this episode
will end before that happens.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.466
Now go on.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.595
Get me... action.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.894
We'll work it out, Henry.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.021
I know.

24:03.984 --> 24:06.278
-(indistinct chattering)
-LARUE: I don't care.

24:06.361 --> 24:09.281
-Hey, Tony, see if they got it on 8, okay?
-Yeah.

24:09.364 --> 24:10.824
Hey, Tomasso.

24:10.907 --> 24:13.452
Hey, that 211 can get active
again real easy.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.954
All right, now I want your butt
in a water department truck

24:16.037 --> 24:17.664
down at Portland and 91st at 6:15,

24:17.747 --> 24:20.167
and I want Niagara Falls
out of that hydrant, pal!

24:21.585 --> 24:23.795
Yeah, yeah,
it's a practical joke on a friend.

24:25.088 --> 24:27.966
Very wise decision, Tomasso. <i>Adiós, amigo.</i>

24:29.468 --> 24:31.303
Hey, Tony, would you see if it's on 8?

24:31.386 --> 24:33.180
(groans)

24:34.097 --> 24:35.557
You banking that race?

24:35.640 --> 24:36.558
Yeah.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.269
I drove once with Renko.
Give me $20 on Larue.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.104
All right, you're down.

24:42.439 --> 24:43.857
Hey, Tony, try 6.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.442
I just had it on 6!

24:45.525 --> 24:46.568
Try it again.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.028
-Is a cop in trouble?
-Yeah.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.197
Come on, guys, I got a bad back.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.366
Why don't you buy one of those
remote-control things, Anthony?

24:53.450 --> 24:55.160
Oh, sure, then all I got is fistfights.

24:55.243 --> 24:57.287
Everybody wants control.

24:57.370 --> 24:59.039
All right, guys, we all set on 6?

24:59.122 --> 25:00.457
Yeah, yeah.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.501
That's it! I drink at Kohl's.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.419
TONY: Whoa, sorry, Mr. Derossi.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.296
I was waiting for my program.

25:06.379 --> 25:09.216
So drink at Kohl's. We got a cop hostage.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.800
They want to know he's okay.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.887
Big shot! Two beers a night.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.556
You think they'd at least
say the guy's name.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.933
It's Lieutenant Goldblume.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.476
I just talked to the precinct.

25:21.436 --> 25:22.771
What else did they tell you?

25:22.854 --> 25:25.065
That's it. Captain's negotiating.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.317
-Do they want backups?
-They want anyone to come in?

25:27.400 --> 25:29.069
Mnh-mnh. I gave them where we are.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.405
Tony, see what's on 12.

25:32.489 --> 25:35.325
I suggest that we mount a diversion,

25:35.408 --> 25:37.577
followed by excising the lieutenant

25:37.661 --> 25:39.996
through one of these windows here.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.416
And by my lights, they have blundered
by sequestering him in the corner room.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.711
Eight TAC groups? Stun bombs?

25:46.795 --> 25:50.215
I asked the lieutenant
to presume engagement

25:50.298 --> 25:51.675
once Goldblume's retrieved.

25:51.758 --> 25:52.842
Chief.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.349
It's a city street.
That building's a bomb.

25:59.432 --> 26:01.268
Oh, for God's sake, Frank.
Look around you.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.852
-Where's Ozzie Cleveland?
-Vacation.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.437
Where are Matthias' former friends

26:04.521 --> 26:06.106
-from the Housing Coalition?
-Chief.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.191
Frank, the man in there
is an embarrassment.

26:08.275 --> 26:11.361
There isn't a black leader in this city
wouldn't be privately delighted

26:11.444 --> 26:13.613
to see the S.O.I.L. house
turned into a parking lot.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.323
I'm not sure Matthias is the one

26:15.407 --> 26:17.784
looking to rehabilitate
his reputation around here.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.996
All right, Frank,
I'm an insensitive opportunist.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.873
I don't flinch
when I see an opportunity to do my job

26:23.957 --> 26:27.168
and at the same time rid
the community of a menace.

26:27.252 --> 26:30.880
This isn't going to turn into a referendum
on Calvin Matthias' politics,

26:30.964 --> 26:32.549
unless you want to take over command.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.884
Oh, please, not the badge.

26:38.221 --> 26:39.431
Modify your plans.

26:39.514 --> 26:41.891
If we have to go in, minimum engagement

26:41.975 --> 26:44.311
once Lieutenant Goldblume is retrieved.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.731
Minimum engagement, Captain.

26:48.607 --> 26:52.027
All right, then illuminate me, Frank.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.237
What's our plan?
Wait for divine intervention?

26:54.321 --> 26:55.989
Maybe he'll change his mind.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.575
My God. I was close.

27:01.911 --> 27:04.789
Oh, there's lots of routine,
tons of paperwork,

27:04.873 --> 27:08.084
but it's not without
its thrills and spills.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.420
It's an okay job. I like it.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.548
What?

27:14.591 --> 27:17.218
Well, you should see yourself
in the glow of that kiln.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.721
What are you saying?
The darker it gets, the better I look?

27:19.804 --> 27:22.098
No, in fact, you look quite beautiful.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.684
That's a little hard to believe.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.019
Maybe you think I'm flirting.

27:26.686 --> 27:27.520
Are you?

27:30.523 --> 27:34.027
No, no, it was a comment, not a come-on.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.321
I'm sorry if I made you nervous.

27:36.404 --> 27:38.448
-I didn't mean to.
-You didn't make me nervous.

27:38.531 --> 27:40.992
It's just that
I'm not used to hearing that.

27:42.202 --> 27:45.914
Well, should be about time.
Let's take a look.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.336
-God.
-Ooh, it looks good.

27:51.419 --> 27:55.423
-Yeah, it's shiny.
-Yeah, hence the name "glaze."

27:58.385 --> 28:00.095
-Ah.
-Nice color.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.971
My daughter made it.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.265
My wife's been teaching her
to work in enamel.

28:05.058 --> 28:06.101
How old?

28:06.643 --> 28:10.855
My daughter's nine.
I also have a ten-year-old boy.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.816
He wanted to be a painter
for about six weeks,

28:12.899 --> 28:15.318
but now it's all computers.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.112
Do you have children?

28:17.195 --> 28:18.988
No, I'm not married.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.156
Oh.

28:21.074 --> 28:24.494
I want to thank you,
but I don't know how to do it.

28:24.577 --> 28:26.162
Did you enjoy yourself?

28:26.246 --> 28:28.623
-Yeah.
-Oh, then that's thanks enough.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.751
Unless you want to come to
my class on Wednesday night.

28:32.752 --> 28:35.046
Well, maybe, maybe I will.

28:36.923 --> 28:39.926
Well... I better go get
some boxes for these things.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.052
Yeah.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.514
(sighs)

28:44.597 --> 28:46.182
(indistinct talk on radio)

28:46.266 --> 28:47.517
When did it happen?

28:49.060 --> 28:51.312
I want someone to go to his stakeout.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.148
I don't want him told over the phone.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.650
Let me know.

28:56.234 --> 28:57.694
MATTHIAS: <i>Captain Furillo?</i>

29:00.864 --> 29:03.533
Fully reconfigured, Frank.
Ready when you are.

29:03.616 --> 29:04.951
MATTHIAS:<i> Where is our money?</i>

29:05.952 --> 29:08.788
It isn't easy raising $2 million, Calvin.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.957
I expected some resistance with the plane.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.209
You have some resistance there, too.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.672
Can't you just see those cops,
running around,

29:17.756 --> 29:20.383
talking to those bankers,
trying to get $2 million?

29:20.467 --> 29:22.844
"Excuse me, sir, we'd like
to have $2 million." "What for?"

29:22.927 --> 29:24.304
"We'd like to buy Calvin a farm."

29:24.387 --> 29:27.891
"Oh, really? How would you like
to have the money? $50s, $100s, $20s?"

29:27.974 --> 29:29.726
(Matthias laughing)

29:33.646 --> 29:35.648
Man, have I heard some jive in my time.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.859
Calvin, you mean they ain't
gonna give us no money?

29:37.942 --> 29:39.402
We're gonna get that money, Jason.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.780
I was just trying to catch them in a lie,
trying to trap them.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.656
There's a reason for everything I do.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.074
Don't let me see doubt in your eye.

29:45.158 --> 29:47.118
Don't let me banish you
from the circle of trust.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.662
Go out and check the others.
Make a circuit of the guards!

29:53.291 --> 29:55.960
You don't think they're gonna
give into your demands, Calvin.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.837
You're forcing yourself down a dead end.

29:57.921 --> 30:00.465
No, you're wrong.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.091
My mind's racing only ahead.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.010
There's no way I can stop the process.

30:05.970 --> 30:09.682
I'm... I'm motivated with a new energy.

30:09.766 --> 30:11.100
(panting)

30:12.227 --> 30:13.603
You know what's happening?

30:17.065 --> 30:19.776
You're trying to decide
whether or not you want to die.

30:22.612 --> 30:23.947
Isn't that right, Calvin?

30:27.116 --> 30:30.620
You know you're not gonna get that money,
you're not gonna fly anyplace.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.625
You just want to figure out
whether you want the whole thing to end.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.712
Let me tell you something, Calvin.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.381
I mean, I got a selfish interest.

30:41.464 --> 30:42.715
I don't want to blow up.

30:44.050 --> 30:46.386
But I know how hard
you worked for this house.

30:48.221 --> 30:50.807
You're still my Renter's Association.
I know this guy.

30:51.432 --> 30:55.353
We had this guy Matthias on our side,
they'd never turn this building co-op.

30:55.436 --> 30:57.647
This guy knows the housing code.

30:58.189 --> 30:59.566
You weren't available.

31:00.108 --> 31:03.027
You were working to see that the runaways

31:03.111 --> 31:05.321
and the bust outs
from the halfway programs

31:05.405 --> 31:07.407
and all the street people
had a place to live.

31:11.327 --> 31:14.247
Yes, I-I-I have worked in my time

31:15.164 --> 31:17.250
so that they'd have a home.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.669
Don't quit working, Calvin. Don't give up.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.881
(voice breaking) And I've ex--

31:23.840 --> 31:25.884
I've experienced despair.

31:27.093 --> 31:29.762
I tried to chemically free myself.

31:31.472 --> 31:33.057
I may have an imbalance.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.476
Don't quit working, Calvin.
Don't stop now.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.229
I've had tremendous expectations

31:38.313 --> 31:40.648
and, and dependence.

31:40.732 --> 31:45.361
I-I-I've allowed myself cruelties!

31:45.445 --> 31:46.779
Don't quit working.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.740
(sobbing)

31:48.823 --> 31:50.033
No!

31:53.828 --> 31:55.038
No!

31:56.289 --> 31:57.874
We're gonna die here!

32:08.468 --> 32:10.261
(indistinct talk on radio)

32:27.278 --> 32:28.404
I sight every time

32:28.488 --> 32:30.615
<i>he moves in front of the east window, sir.</i>

32:31.449 --> 32:32.909
Roger, dog unit. Standby.

32:32.992 --> 32:35.411
MATTHIAS: <i>All right, Captain Furillo,</i>
<i>where do we stand?</i>

32:35.495 --> 32:38.164
<i>-Time is running out.</i>
-We'll have a decision soon, Calvin.

32:38.247 --> 32:40.750
You'll have a decision soon
on that money, huh?

32:50.677 --> 32:53.012
They don't intend to pay
this man's reparations.

32:53.846 --> 32:57.350
What they intend to do
is to assault this house.

32:57.433 --> 32:59.435
You made them reveal themselves, Calvin.

32:59.519 --> 33:00.853
You brought the peace down.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.939
No, we had a plan for a time like this.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.857
-That's right, Calvin.
-That's right!

33:04.941 --> 33:05.942
Those of you

33:06.025 --> 33:10.321
<i>who have assignments</i>
<i>on that plan, stay here.</i>

33:13.324 --> 33:15.034
You others, go to your rooms.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.296
Know that more than
our blood's gonna spill.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.716
He's talking about
blowing the place up, Frank.

33:30.299 --> 33:32.051
Ready your support units, Howard.

33:32.593 --> 33:33.761
(man on radio, indistinct)

33:33.845 --> 33:36.305
All units, prepare to go to condition red.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.941
I hope to hell you didn't wait
too long on this, Captain.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.068
(indistinct talk on radio)

33:49.152 --> 33:50.570
Take him on the next sighting.

33:50.653 --> 33:55.241
I'm offering S.O.I.L. 12 units
in the Clark Redevelopment.

33:55.324 --> 33:58.536
(laughs) Oh, that's just great.

33:58.619 --> 34:01.581
This man's offering
what the Housing Coalition couldn't give,

34:01.664 --> 34:04.083
what the Urban Congress
kicked us out for demanding.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.502
I'm committing to it.
Listen to me, Calvin!

34:19.098 --> 34:21.142
We're reopening negotiations.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.435
Now you just get one answer.

34:22.518 --> 34:23.770
Hold your fire, Howard.

34:24.437 --> 34:26.230
Hold your fire, dog unit. Hold fire.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.524
What's the question, Calvin?

34:29.150 --> 34:30.985
Your man here said that S.O.I.L.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.446
could have housing units
in the Clark Redevelopment.

34:33.529 --> 34:36.532
-True or lying?
-Housing units?

34:38.451 --> 34:40.703
-Um... let's talk.
-True or false?

34:40.787 --> 34:44.373
Um... let me get
the housing people down here.

34:44.999 --> 34:47.960
See? Now they break your hearts.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.130
-You said 12 units.
-That's possible.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.799
I mean, it's a basis for discussion.

34:52.882 --> 34:55.635
It's not some left-field request
for seven figures and a plane.

34:55.718 --> 34:57.804
Frank, the man has dynamite in there,

34:57.887 --> 34:59.764
and he's planning to use it.

34:59.847 --> 35:02.767
MATTHIAS: <i>I gave you one answer,</i>
<i>and you returned it with a lie.</i>

35:02.850 --> 35:05.061
<i>Now we're going from 12 to 100.</i>

35:05.144 --> 35:08.648
Do you hear me? We demand 100 units!

35:10.566 --> 35:12.902
Frank, will you reinstate the order?

35:13.402 --> 35:14.654
This is jive.

35:16.781 --> 35:19.158
Get all the people on the roof!
Jason, now!

35:19.242 --> 35:20.952
Get them on the roof now!

35:22.995 --> 35:24.664
Reinstate the order, Howard.

35:28.376 --> 35:32.338
Dog unit, take your target at opportunity.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.015
Where's the sunrise, man?

35:48.688 --> 35:49.689
Calvin, listen.

35:53.943 --> 35:55.027
Calvin!

35:55.111 --> 35:56.362
(gunshot)

35:56.445 --> 36:00.700
(dramatic music playing)

36:14.213 --> 36:17.133
Let's get on the roof!
Explosives on the roof!

36:17.216 --> 36:21.304
-MAN: Go, go, go!
-MAN 2: Secure the roof! Move it! Move it!

36:37.486 --> 36:39.363
(growls)

36:52.376 --> 36:56.130
-(grunting)
-(groaning)

36:56.839 --> 36:59.008
-You're under arrest!
-I ain't done nothing, man.

36:59.091 --> 37:01.969
-No? What is this? What is this, huh?
-I ain't been inside!

37:02.053 --> 37:04.430
What is this?
This looks like a burglar's tool.

37:04.513 --> 37:05.598
Detective Belker?

37:06.057 --> 37:07.683
You interfered with my bust.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.227
They sent us to get you, Detective.

37:10.019 --> 37:11.687
You've got some personal business.

37:11.771 --> 37:14.857
(siren wails)

37:14.941 --> 37:16.275
All right, Henry.

37:16.359 --> 37:18.653
Any the worse for your stay
in that loony bin?

37:20.404 --> 37:22.740
I'm all right.
Thanks for getting me out of there.

37:22.823 --> 37:23.950
No problem, Lieutenant.

37:27.453 --> 37:31.207
The guy... had ideas, Howard.

37:31.290 --> 37:34.669
The man was an ambulatory psychopath.

37:34.752 --> 37:37.713
We let it get away from us.
We should have gotten him out of there.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.343
(sighs)

37:42.426 --> 37:45.054
That's why there's chocolate and vanilla.

37:45.137 --> 37:46.639
Eh, Valentine?

37:46.722 --> 37:49.141
<i>Let's see if we can try</i>
<i>and talk to the released officer.</i>

37:49.225 --> 37:51.769
<i>-Lieutenant?</i>
<i>-Nothing. No comment. Sorry.</i>

37:51.852 --> 37:53.145
<i>Well, I guess there was...</i>

37:53.229 --> 37:54.939
Well, say something, Lieutenant.

37:55.022 --> 37:57.525
Yeah, come on. Tell it like it was.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.694
-Man's got a way with words.
-Yeah.

38:00.778 --> 38:01.696
Yeah, okay.

38:01.779 --> 38:04.865
Hey, Joe, McKenzie for a sawbuck on Renko.

38:04.949 --> 38:06.617
Will you chalk it up for me, Bobby?

38:06.701 --> 38:07.702
Yeah.

38:11.163 --> 38:13.124
So what's with this negativity, Gretchen?

38:13.207 --> 38:15.042
Joe, do I have to paint a picture?

38:15.710 --> 38:17.795
I haven't even seen you in three weeks.

38:17.878 --> 38:20.089
We were supposed to meet at the show.

38:20.172 --> 38:21.841
Then you changed it to Carmine's.

38:21.924 --> 38:24.510
-Then, forget Carmine's.
-That happens to be a buddy of mine

38:24.593 --> 38:25.511
who was being held.

38:25.594 --> 38:27.680
You blew off the show
when I called last week.

38:27.763 --> 38:29.265
Yeah, but this explains Carmine's.

38:31.058 --> 38:33.686
Hey... do you want to go home?

38:34.186 --> 38:35.479
Do you want to get friendly?

38:36.564 --> 38:38.357
(woman screams)

38:38.441 --> 38:41.110
MAN: Suarez stabbed me.
Can you believe that?

38:42.153 --> 38:45.364
That chicken-brain Suarez
went and stabbed...

38:45.448 --> 38:48.367
-(gasps) Oh!
-Mr. Robinson, can you walk?

38:48.451 --> 38:49.452
In my car, babe.

38:49.535 --> 38:52.288
-I got plastic seat covers.
-Okay, now easy does it, Mr. Robinson.

38:52.371 --> 38:54.540
The man had a knife sticking out of him.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.626
Yeah, well, a lot of times, nothing vital.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.045
He could be okay like that.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.005
You mean he's gonna have to live that way?

39:02.340 --> 39:03.799
Never mind. Come on.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.885
(sighs) I hate police work!

39:10.890 --> 39:11.974
You see this?

39:12.725 --> 39:14.352
You know the <i>weisswurst </i>don't agree.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.729
And yet you'll sit
and you'll beg for the <i>weisswurst</i>,

39:16.812 --> 39:19.440
and then two hours later,
you're impossible to be with.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.777
Go now! Go, stinkpot.

39:23.486 --> 39:24.779
Sleep in the other bedroom.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.318
(groans)

40:09.281 --> 40:10.116
Blackie.

40:15.287 --> 40:16.539
Control yourself now.

40:19.458 --> 40:22.628
(melodramatic music playing)

40:33.514 --> 40:35.099
(whispering) Bye-bye, sweetheart.

40:37.852 --> 40:39.562
Pop will take care of you now.

41:09.675 --> 41:10.718
Captain.

41:11.677 --> 41:12.928
I'm sorry, Mick.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.310
And they got a buddy system,

41:19.393 --> 41:22.396
and she didn't answer
Mrs. Vascinski's call.

41:26.984 --> 41:30.237
Doctor said that her heart just gave out.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.534
How old was your mom?

41:38.120 --> 41:40.206
(voice breaking) 84 years old.

41:43.792 --> 41:47.129
She wasn't a young woman,
and my father was gone.

41:47.213 --> 41:48.422
Her pals...

41:49.089 --> 41:51.842
She had to get paired up
with this Mrs. Vascinski

41:52.426 --> 41:54.303
at the citizens' center.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.264
They didn't even know each other.

41:59.642 --> 42:03.395
But the doctor said that...
she didn't suffer.

42:04.813 --> 42:06.148
(crying)

42:08.859 --> 42:11.195
I'm gonna miss her so much!

42:12.530 --> 42:13.531
(gasps)

42:22.122 --> 42:23.082
Hi.

42:23.165 --> 42:26.043
Hey, honey. Baby okay?

42:26.126 --> 42:28.671
Oh, she's fine. I just couldn't sleep.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.382
You know, I started looking at the paper.

42:32.132 --> 42:34.510
-I think I'm gonna get a job.
-Job?

42:34.593 --> 42:36.762
Just something to bring in
a little more money.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.348
You work all day, and then
you work nights, too.

42:39.431 --> 42:41.016
It's too much.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.394
I tried to cut expenses,
but I just can't--

42:43.477 --> 42:45.312
Working nights comes with my job.

42:47.606 --> 42:50.317
Andy, it hurts me that you couldn't go
to that concert tonight.

42:51.193 --> 42:52.861
I know how you wanted to.

42:54.029 --> 42:55.239
(sighs)

42:58.367 --> 42:59.535
Daryl Ann...

42:59.618 --> 43:00.578
What?

43:03.956 --> 43:05.833
I went to the concert.

43:06.417 --> 43:07.960
I saw Bobby Angel.

43:11.422 --> 43:15.175
-I thought we couldn't afford it.
-I know, but I got this pass here,

43:15.259 --> 43:17.177
where I got to see Bobby Angel.

43:17.261 --> 43:20.639
And I figured if I did work extra hours...

43:24.310 --> 43:25.894
You hate me now, Daryl?

43:28.439 --> 43:29.773
Don't lie to me, Andy.

43:30.399 --> 43:31.775
It will ruin things.

43:41.785 --> 43:42.828
Sorry, girl.

43:43.996 --> 43:46.081
You want to know what else
happened down there?

43:47.499 --> 43:48.626
Later.

43:52.338 --> 43:54.715
Me and J.D. are gonna race
to work this morning.

43:54.798 --> 43:57.968
He said Portland was faster,
and I said Clifford.

43:59.136 --> 44:01.138
Clifford's faster to Hill Street, Andy?

44:02.765 --> 44:04.350
Clifford to Hill Street, yeah.

44:05.184 --> 44:08.562
What, I got a naysayer in my own bed?

44:08.646 --> 44:10.064
(chuckles)

44:11.940 --> 44:13.108
You're the driver.

44:13.192 --> 44:15.027
(laughs)

44:19.114 --> 44:21.492
(sighs)

44:22.618 --> 44:23.786
Henry all right?

44:24.536 --> 44:25.996
He'll be all right.

44:28.457 --> 44:30.000
Rose McNeil called.

44:31.377 --> 44:34.171
Wants to know if we're free
for dinner Saturday.

44:42.805 --> 44:44.807
Good morning, good morning.

44:45.641 --> 44:47.643
Good morning. (groans)

44:47.726 --> 44:50.312
Gentlemen, start your engines.

44:50.396 --> 44:54.316
-(engines turn over)
-(crowd cheers)

44:55.025 --> 44:57.403
(engines rev)

45:02.574 --> 45:04.243
(tires squeaking)

45:06.036 --> 45:09.039
Talk about your Olympics.
Talk about your Super Bowls.

45:09.123 --> 45:11.166
This is gonna be one knockdown drag-out,

45:11.250 --> 45:14.253
nip-and-tuck, all-out contest
between two great competitors.

45:14.336 --> 45:16.755
I understand they aren't
permitted over the speed limit.

45:17.381 --> 45:18.966
-WASHINGTON: Uh, Andy?
-What?

45:19.049 --> 45:21.093
Looks like you're going over 30, like 40.

45:21.176 --> 45:23.137
It's the angle you're looking at, man.

45:23.721 --> 45:25.139
40, babe.

45:25.222 --> 45:27.516
Don't you think your partner's
romancing the rules

45:27.599 --> 45:29.977
a little bit over there on Portland?

45:30.853 --> 45:32.187
What the devil's this?

45:32.271 --> 45:33.355
Looks pretty deep, Andy.

45:33.439 --> 45:35.315
Well, hang on, brother. I'm going through.

45:35.399 --> 45:37.109
(tires screech)

45:38.193 --> 45:39.528
No!

45:45.284 --> 45:47.327
(engine sputters)

45:47.411 --> 45:50.205
Oh, sweet mother in heaven,
I can't believe this.

45:50.289 --> 45:52.166
I can't believe this has happened.

45:52.249 --> 45:53.542
Andy, look here.

45:54.376 --> 45:56.920
Oh, my. Neal, look at that.

45:57.004 --> 45:59.673
Water Department truck's just
sitting there doing nothing.

45:59.757 --> 46:02.176
-Uh-huh.
-Come on, pal. Just sit there.

46:02.259 --> 46:04.678
You don't want to ruin
your coffee break, now do you?

46:04.762 --> 46:06.805
Huh? Hey! Hey!

46:07.473 --> 46:10.058
Heck of a time to get
a busted speedometer, J.D.

46:10.142 --> 46:11.727
Happened a couple of days ago.

46:11.810 --> 46:13.979
Yeah, well, my expert opinion
as a police officer,

46:14.062 --> 46:16.607
your present MPH is 47.

46:16.690 --> 46:19.234
Yeah, well, in my expert opinion,
you're way off.

46:19.318 --> 46:21.737
(siren wails)

46:21.820 --> 46:25.449
-I guess they're <i>way </i>off too.
-Give me a break.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.160
We're cops! Hill Street!

46:28.243 --> 46:31.830
Us too. The Heights. Pull over!

46:31.914 --> 46:34.082
Ha ha ha ha!

46:35.083 --> 46:37.961
-(indistinct chattering)
-Good morning.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.755
-Good morning.
-WOMAN: Morning, Sarge.

46:39.838 --> 46:41.048
Hey, Sarge.

46:41.131 --> 46:43.926
I have been the victim of skullduggery!

46:44.009 --> 46:45.010
Tell them, Neal.

46:45.093 --> 46:46.345
Hey, J.D.'s not here yet.

46:47.679 --> 46:50.265
-You got a winner.
-(all cheering)

46:51.350 --> 46:54.353
-You got a winner right here!
-No sale, Renko!

46:54.436 --> 46:56.939
I saw you getting out of the cab.

46:57.022 --> 46:58.357
(booing)

46:58.899 --> 46:59.942
HUNTER: Excuse me.

47:00.025 --> 47:01.193
Excuse me.

47:01.276 --> 47:04.196
Excuse me. Mr. Renko arrived
in a hired vehicle.

47:04.279 --> 47:05.364
Oh, yeah.

47:05.447 --> 47:07.908
Mr. Larue's car was driven by Mr. Hill.

47:07.991 --> 47:10.869
-WOMAN: What?
-The referee declares no contest.

47:10.953 --> 47:12.371
(all moaning)

47:13.705 --> 47:16.083
Andy, get in there, get changed, will you?

47:17.376 --> 47:18.544
What happened, babe?

47:18.627 --> 47:19.878
It's not bad enough.

47:19.962 --> 47:21.839
That Heights cop
gives me a speeding ticket.

47:21.922 --> 47:23.131
He says Hill's got to drive

47:23.215 --> 47:25.634
because my driver's license
is a little expired.

47:25.717 --> 47:28.929
Night guy says he needs Belker's signature
on this arrest report, Sarge.

47:29.972 --> 47:32.266
Belker's gonna be taking
a personal day today.

47:33.976 --> 47:37.271
Okay, let's get started. Let's listen up.

47:39.356 --> 47:40.440
Item one.

47:45.153 --> 47:49.157
(theme music playing)
