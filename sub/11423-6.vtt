You know,
is easy to protest.

Show up with sign, saying,
"I no like! It's no right!"

17:15.834 --> 17:18.268
But then what?
But what is the solution?

17:18.270 --> 17:20.503
What do you do about it?
Send back to Russia,

17:20.505 --> 17:23.440
live in shit village?
I didn't think about that.

17:23.442 --> 17:24.507
I know.
Nobody thinks about it.

17:24.509 --> 17:28.812
It's okay. It's all right.
[ Sighs deeply ] I think.

17:28.814 --> 17:31.881
[ Inhales sharply ]
You take care of us now.

17:31.883 --> 17:36.920
Yes. I can be mistress.
I will wear heels for him.

17:36.922 --> 17:39.856
Sorry. That's only solution.

17:39.858 --> 17:41.925
Can I get you something?

17:41.927 --> 17:45.762
A candy bar? Svetlana: No.
But I would like clothes,

17:45.764 --> 17:48.731
shelter,
money for life of travel.

17:48.733 --> 17:50.700
Cosmetic procedures.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.869
Yeah, I don't think
I can afford that.

17:52.871 --> 17:56.539
And what if you were
to impregnate me?

17:57.876 --> 17:58.775
That's...

17:58.777 --> 18:02.512
Who's the next of kin? Uh, should be my
daughter. They're engaged to be married.

18:02.514 --> 18:07.383
Okay. Um, well, it looks like the internal
bleeding is -- they'd already be married

18:07.385 --> 18:09.018
if it wasn't for
his judgmental mother.

18:09.020 --> 18:12.522
Okay, well, he's feeling up
for a visit,

18:12.524 --> 18:15.291
so you're welcome
to come in and see him.

Yeah, I think we're done.
Yeah, let's get out of here.

18:24.002 --> 18:28.505
No. I think
you should marry them.

18:28.507 --> 18:31.374
What? Svetlana deserves
a better life.

18:31.376 --> 18:35.445
And once she gets
her money problem under control,

18:35.447 --> 18:37.413
she can find me, and I can...

18:37.415 --> 18:39.616
I can put a baby in her.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.484
No. No, no. Don't...

18:41.486 --> 18:42.552
No. No.
Fix that.

young -- young, young girl...

19:00.906 --> 19:03.907
[ Groans ] To be your

19:03.909 --> 19:06.042
You gotta honor and cherish
and obey her

19:06.044 --> 19:10.680
for the rest of your quite
possibly few remaining days?

19:10.682 --> 19:12.849

So...Okay, that's a "yes."

19:12.851 --> 19:14.484

Hi, this is Nate Parker.
I'm a guest at the hotel.

19:41.446 --> 19:44.714
Um, has -- has a package arrived
for me yet?

19:44.716 --> 19:47.517

Um, can you call me if it does?

Okay, thank you. Bye.
I wanted to say thank you.

So did you see the old dude

Woman:
I know. It's disgusting.

How much you wanna bet
they're actually poisoning him?

20:00.432 --> 20:02.765
What? No, his toxicology
was clean.

20:02.767 --> 20:05.735
I know. I had the same thing
a few years ago.

20:05.737 --> 20:07.270
They use antifreeze.

20:07.272 --> 20:08.705
It's sweet-tasting
and undetectable.

And over time,
it rips the guy apart.
