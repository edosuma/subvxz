WEBVTT

00:06.484 --> 00:09.139
- Previously on
"The Magicians"...

00:10.271 --> 00:10.314
- I will save the people
of Fillory.

00:13.187 --> 00:14.492
- The people would decide

00:14.536 --> 00:16.451
to make this dark wizard
their king,

00:16.494 --> 00:18.496
the Dark King.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.498
- So you built a golem
out of living clay,

00:20.542 --> 00:21.847
and then you animated
the whole thing

00:21.891 --> 00:23.675
with his essence?

00:23.719 --> 00:26.330
- No, it's just a tiny grain
of Q's soul

00:26.374 --> 00:28.115
that I pulled
from the Underworld.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.508
- Put back the piece of Q's
essence that you stole

00:30.552 --> 00:31.857
and let him be at rest.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.511
- Good-bye, Quentin.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.122
- Some surges come and go

00:35.165 --> 00:36.732
and hardly anyone
notices.

00:36.775 --> 00:39.822
- And sometimes
it's a catastrophe.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.389
- Is there any way
to predict them?

00:41.432 --> 00:42.868
Look, I need help
with a metamath problem.

00:42.912 --> 00:44.392
- My dad had a friend

00:44.435 --> 00:47.569
with a really rare
discipline,

00:47.612 --> 00:49.223
predicting circumstances.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.485
She wrote this.

00:50.528 --> 00:52.226
- Wait.
I recognize these.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.184
Put 'em on a letter,

00:54.228 --> 00:55.881
address it to whoever,
wherever,

00:55.925 --> 00:57.666
whenever,
and it gets to them.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.584
- Because I want you
to be safe.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.673
- I want you to be safe.

01:04.716 --> 01:07.110
- Are you saying that you--
- No, I'm just--

01:07.154 --> 01:09.547
we've tried the whole
"saving each other" thing

01:09.591 --> 01:11.680
with mixed results.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.551
- Yeah.

01:13.595 --> 01:15.205
Sure, but I--

01:15.249 --> 01:18.165
- And I've been thinking
about what works best,

01:18.208 --> 01:20.167
and I think--
no, I know--

01:20.210 --> 01:23.822
that we're best when we're
a team and we work together,

01:23.866 --> 01:24.867
you and me.

01:26.869 --> 01:28.262
- If nothing else,
I like the sound of it.

01:33.702 --> 01:35.486
- Quentin?

01:35.530 --> 01:36.792
Quentin!

02:04.646 --> 02:05.821
Oh, shit.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.832
- Whoo, yeah!
There she is!

02:16.875 --> 02:18.747
- Champagne for our girl!
- Whoo!

02:18.790 --> 02:21.619
High King Margo,
a thousand huzzahs!

02:21.663 --> 02:24.274
- Go, Bambi.
- Um, why?

02:24.318 --> 02:25.623
- We wanted to honor you,

02:25.667 --> 02:27.451
so when Julia sent us the bunny

02:27.495 --> 02:30.411
saying that they put
the clock in here,

02:30.454 --> 02:32.413
we asked them to stock up
on celebratory beverages.

02:32.456 --> 02:33.805
- Stay on mission.
We're going back.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.285
- Copy.
Give me 30.

02:35.329 --> 02:36.547
We'll have cookies
to help brainstorm

02:36.591 --> 02:38.245
how you're gonna overthrow
the Dark King.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.381
- Well, your subjects
are rightly grateful.

02:44.425 --> 02:46.296
- For sending that letter?

02:46.340 --> 02:47.863
A.K.A. that thing
I totally didn't do.

02:47.906 --> 02:49.386
You did.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.692
Why split a hair?

02:50.735 --> 02:52.433
Let them bake cookies.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.348
- Lie cookies?
- It's not a lie.

02:54.391 --> 02:56.524
You saved them through me,
your advisor,

02:56.567 --> 02:57.612
acting on your behalf.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.004
- Nice retcon.

02:59.048 --> 03:01.746
- Then as a wise king
once said,

03:01.790 --> 03:03.357
ovary up.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.880
Let your subjects be inspired

03:04.923 --> 03:07.404
by a simple,
uncomplicated story.

03:07.448 --> 03:08.884
That's what the people want.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.241
Would you excuse me?

03:21.549 --> 03:22.854
Where are you going,
and why are you dressed

03:22.898 --> 03:24.029
like a goth survivalist?

03:24.073 --> 03:25.901
- Fillory, just quick.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.946
- What you got there?
- Nothing.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.602
I did a thing.
This is a byproduct.

03:31.646 --> 03:32.864
I just have to take care of it.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.563
- Alice, do you need help?

03:35.606 --> 03:37.042
You seem a little bit
distressed.

03:37.086 --> 03:39.393
- I'm fine.

03:39.436 --> 03:40.568
I just have to do it alone.

03:40.611 --> 03:43.397
- Okay, great.
What was the spell?

03:43.440 --> 03:45.268
- I made a golem, okay?

03:45.312 --> 03:46.922
You've done it before.
It's not a big deal.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.793
- A golem of who?

03:48.837 --> 03:51.666
- Can we--can we not
be dramatic about this?

03:51.709 --> 03:53.755
I used his book
from the Library.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.020
- Quentin's?
- But I was out of my mind,

03:58.063 --> 04:01.066
and I didn't think that
this would just stay here

04:01.110 --> 04:02.981
when I buried the golem
and not be released.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.550
It's Essence.

04:06.594 --> 04:07.856
It's a tiny piece of his soul.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.074
- I'm sorry, you pulled

04:09.118 --> 04:10.554
an actual piece
of Quentin's soul

04:10.598 --> 04:12.774
out of his--
that is insane.

04:12.817 --> 04:13.949
What if it's--
- Keeping him from resting?

04:13.992 --> 04:15.733
- Well, is it?

04:15.777 --> 04:17.344
- I just need to get
to the top of this mountain

04:17.387 --> 04:18.388
and throw it in.

04:18.432 --> 04:19.650
- The Mountain of Ghosts

04:19.694 --> 04:21.043
that Rupert Chatwin
was looking for

04:21.086 --> 04:22.523
before the band of aggressive

04:22.566 --> 04:24.089
talking squirrels
kidnapped him?

04:24.133 --> 04:25.482
I'm finally reading the books.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.310
Margo has been
on my ass about it.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.007
Anyway, is that it?

04:29.051 --> 04:30.705
The one with the hole
at the top that goes--

04:30.748 --> 04:32.576
- All the way down
to the Underworld?

04:34.056 --> 04:36.319
- Yes.
- Well, this is too important.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.060
I'm helping.
- I don't need your help.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.017
- Well, you're getting it.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.719
- Fine.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.786
- Head hurt from the patch?

05:08.830 --> 05:12.137
- Uh, it beats the noise.

05:12.181 --> 05:13.748
Burning through them,
though,

05:13.791 --> 05:15.837
so looking
for some real answers.

05:17.839 --> 05:20.798
None of these books
is for shit.

05:20.842 --> 05:23.584
Requested some from the Library
but not getting the sense

05:23.627 --> 05:25.325
they're gonna be that speedy.

05:26.500 --> 05:30.547
- So, while you're waiting...

05:31.896 --> 05:34.595
- God, that--
always a great idea,

05:34.638 --> 05:36.814
but I really do have
a headache.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.773
- No, I need a ride.

05:42.820 --> 05:43.691
Fine.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.831
- I've been thinking,
we should tell her.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.747
- Look, can we just concentrate
one thing at a time, please?

05:56.791 --> 05:58.923
Let's just get her back
on the throne, huh?

05:58.967 --> 06:01.665
- Yeah, well,
with those banishment brands,

06:01.709 --> 06:02.971
good luck getting her
in the kingdom,

06:03.014 --> 06:04.799
never mind the castle.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.409
- Oh, shit.

06:06.453 --> 06:07.845
What month is it in Fillory?

06:07.889 --> 06:09.630
Is it spring yet?

06:09.673 --> 06:11.849
- Yellow Ferret Month, yes.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.503
- Have you ever seen the movie
"The Dirty Dozen"?

06:13.547 --> 06:14.852
Not the porn one.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.680
- No, and I have a life,
so summarize.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.029
- Uh, not important.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.162
Point is, it inspired me
to do this thing

06:20.205 --> 06:23.078
when the Taker attacks
were just starting.

06:23.121 --> 06:25.123
We needed better guards,

06:25.167 --> 06:28.083
so I created
an annual tournament.

06:28.126 --> 06:30.041
- First week of the month
of the Yellow Ferret

06:30.085 --> 06:32.827
to find the 12 greatest
fighters in the land

06:32.870 --> 06:36.526
to become our elite
Centurion Guard.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.702
- Pretty cool name, right?
- Yeah.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.791
- Anyway, we offered
fame, glory,

06:40.835 --> 06:43.533
and instant wipe-clean
of your criminal record,

06:43.577 --> 06:46.188
including--uh-huh--
banishment marks.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.494
- And if they still hold
the tournament,

06:47.537 --> 06:50.192
it would be going on now,
as we speak.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.673
- We should check on that, no?

06:58.548 --> 07:01.116
- It's Living Stone, I think.

07:01.159 --> 07:02.160
Huh.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.119
"Beware Takers."

07:04.162 --> 07:05.642
- "Beyond The Wall
Adventure Tours,

07:05.686 --> 07:06.687
500 feet that way."

07:09.037 --> 07:10.473
- Fill 'em.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.257
Rocks, lots of dust.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.955
- That'll be heavy.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.522
- Burns Takers.

07:15.565 --> 07:16.740
They come at night.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.699
We'll make a circle
to camp in.

07:18.742 --> 07:21.702
Or, hey, travel light
if you want to die.

07:21.745 --> 07:25.227
- So...Takers.
What exactly are they?

07:26.141 --> 07:27.229
- You really don't know?

07:28.056 --> 07:29.100
- No.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.757
- Umber's tit.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.063
Don't tell me you're grievers.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.847
- What's wrong with that?

07:36.891 --> 07:38.980
- You're not prepared
for the mountain.

07:39.023 --> 07:40.634
You can't run fast because
you've been sitting around

07:40.677 --> 07:42.505
eating cake and crying.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.681
- Okay, I can grieve
and handle a little cardio,

07:44.725 --> 07:45.943
thank you very much.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.945
- Yeah, we're Magicians.
We'll be fine.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.121
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.776
You're planning to throw
something in at the top,

07:52.820 --> 07:54.125
keep it safe.

07:54.169 --> 07:56.127
Takers don't just take people.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.652
They know what thing you value
and swipe it.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.049
- Alice.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.140
This zips.

08:09.184 --> 08:10.490
It's the safest thing
we've got.

08:12.274 --> 08:14.102
Alice, please let me take it.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.233
- Okay.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.323
Well, this stopped
being fun.

09:01.366 --> 09:02.890
- Yeah, well,
you wanted to come.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.066
- Sure did.
And it's awful.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.981
- Yeah, well,
it's meant to be.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.330
But maybe you don't feel
that way because

09:08.373 --> 09:09.810
it's not your pilgrimage.

09:11.942 --> 09:14.075
- What's that supposed to mean?

09:14.118 --> 09:16.643
- Nothing.
Can we please not bicker?

09:16.686 --> 09:19.863
- Sure.
Let's not bicker.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.735
What did you mean by
not my pilgrimage?

09:24.259 --> 09:26.870
- I mean I'm here putting
my boyfriend to rest,

09:26.914 --> 09:28.350
and you tagged along.

09:29.307 --> 09:30.918
- Right.

09:30.961 --> 09:32.746
Because I barely knew him.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.356
- You know what I mean.

09:34.399 --> 09:37.620
You're here out of some sort
of combination of thinking

09:37.664 --> 09:40.014
I'm incompetent and your guilt
that he died saving you.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.624
- You know what?

09:41.668 --> 09:43.278
You are way too smart
for me to ascribe

09:43.321 --> 09:45.193
what just you said
to total stupidity,

09:45.236 --> 09:47.064
so I'm gonna go ahead
and I'm gonna file it

09:47.108 --> 09:49.153
under you must be fucking
joking right now.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.634
- No, I'm not!

09:51.678 --> 09:54.158
This is hard enough
without you judging me

09:54.202 --> 09:55.420
every step of the way.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.031
- Is that how you don't bicker?

09:57.074 --> 09:58.249
'Cause that would explain a lot

09:58.293 --> 10:00.034
about how you and Q
kept falling apart,

10:00.077 --> 10:01.731
beyond the obvious,
of course.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.690
- The obvious?
- Yeah.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.648
- What, like drunk threesomes
with you and Margo?

10:05.692 --> 10:07.911
- Oh, hmm, solid point,
but I was thinking more

10:07.955 --> 10:10.087
that one time where
you betrayed all of us,

10:10.131 --> 10:12.002
I ended up possessed,
and Q died

10:12.046 --> 10:13.047
cleaning up the mess.

10:16.833 --> 10:19.749
- And time for Yan
to roll a smoke.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.274
That was a little harsh.

10:23.318 --> 10:25.712
- And correct.

10:25.755 --> 10:29.890
- But not right because
you also saved my life.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.848
- Right.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.328
Trying to fix the mess I made.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.985
Here we are again.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.164
So let's just finish this,
okay?

10:49.083 --> 10:51.215
Yan, let's go.

10:51.259 --> 10:52.739
- Finished with your feelings?

10:53.870 --> 10:55.437
Yes.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.789
- Uh...

10:59.833 --> 11:01.835
Alice, no.
Don't go that way.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.585
- Good luck,
and enjoy the tournament.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.283
Hello.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.764
I am Bick of the esteemed
House Pickwick.

11:17.807 --> 11:20.636
Who is entering?
- Me.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.377
- Your name?
- Janet.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.509
- Janet.
- Pluchinsky.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.773
- Weapon of choice?
- Me.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.775
But also, I like axes.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.167
- Ah.

11:31.516 --> 11:34.258
You are registered.
Proceed--

11:34.302 --> 11:35.782
- I'm entering too.

11:35.825 --> 11:38.698
I just want to.

11:39.742 --> 11:42.614
My name's Fen...cicle.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.834
Wahl...burger.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.575
- Weapon of choice?
- Knives.

11:48.011 --> 11:50.753
I choose to use
my Childsplay knives,

11:50.797 --> 11:53.887
the kind of knives they give
to very young children.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.672
- Wow.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.675
You had some kind of childhood.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.546
- Hmm.

12:03.940 --> 12:06.987
- Okay, so I found you this.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.292
- Fuck my life.

12:08.336 --> 12:09.554
- Or I can get you
something else.

12:09.598 --> 12:10.642
- I just tried to do Singh's

12:10.686 --> 12:11.774
Advanced Skin Hardening
twice,

12:11.818 --> 12:12.993
and touch me.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.690
Smooth and perfect,

12:14.734 --> 12:16.605
and I'm getting eaten alive

12:16.648 --> 12:18.825
by whimsical goddamn
Fillorian bugs.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.000
- Huh.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.742
Um, you know what?

12:22.785 --> 12:25.614
You just keep practicing
that shield casting,

12:25.657 --> 12:28.965
and I'm, uh, gonna go
check on something real quick.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.370
- Do we even have
an appointment?

12:42.413 --> 12:43.937
- What do you think?

12:50.465 --> 12:53.381
- What the hell just happened?

12:53.424 --> 12:55.426
Where are we?

12:55.470 --> 12:57.951
- Um, excuse me.
Is this PK Endeavors?

12:57.994 --> 12:59.387
I have an appointment.
- These two look confused.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.389
Hi. Zoe Markus.
I run the joint.

13:01.432 --> 13:02.738
- Julia Wicker.
We E-mailed.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.392
- Hey, why does
this place look exactly

13:04.435 --> 13:05.523
like the Physical Kids'
cottage?

13:06.611 --> 13:07.874
- You went to Brakebills?

13:07.917 --> 13:10.572
- I'm a professor
at Brakebills.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.704
- Really?

13:12.748 --> 13:15.533
Breakbills.
Best years of my life.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.057
Hence...

13:17.100 --> 13:18.710
I did a study.

13:18.754 --> 13:21.496
Most Magicians
cast 23% more accurately

13:21.539 --> 13:23.019
when they've been drinking.

13:23.063 --> 13:26.414
God, we're fucked.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.068
So what can I help you with?

13:28.111 --> 13:29.504
Stocks, you said?

13:29.547 --> 13:30.940
- I did say that.

13:30.984 --> 13:33.334
Uh, we were hoping to talk
to your sister Daniella.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.509
- How come?

13:34.552 --> 13:35.858
- Well, um, to start,

13:35.902 --> 13:37.338
you know how magic
was regulated?

13:37.381 --> 13:38.861
- Until it wasn't,
thank God.

13:38.905 --> 13:42.430
- Well, we stopped that,
and a lot worse.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.606
A friend of ours did,

13:44.649 --> 13:46.651
but there were side effects.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.392
Like the surges,
which are...

13:48.436 --> 13:50.481
- Getting stronger.

13:50.525 --> 13:53.528
- We're concerned we're heading
towards a major event.

13:53.571 --> 13:54.703
- And you need--

13:54.746 --> 13:55.791
- Daniella to predict

13:55.835 --> 13:56.966
when it's going to happen.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.665
We'll pay what we can.

14:00.709 --> 14:03.930
Zoe, you and your sister would
be helping to save the world.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.847
- I'd love to help...
- Great.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.719
- But unfortunately,
I must decline.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.460
Please, stay as long
as you like.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.114
- Wait.

14:14.157 --> 14:15.332
Shit.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.553
Shit.
- It's okay.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.642
We'll figure something out.
Come on.

14:29.651 --> 14:32.741
- Okay, so I got some
kinda bad news.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.656
Fillory has two moons,
and if either is full,

14:34.699 --> 14:36.136
then wolf time.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.615
- So one of them's full soon?

14:37.659 --> 14:39.400
- Both are tomorrow night,

14:39.443 --> 14:42.055
which is why your wolf PMS
is acting so bad right now.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.883
- I'm about to be
a double werewolf?

14:43.926 --> 14:46.407
- It's okay because
there are still cages.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.409
I checked,
so it's totally fine.

14:48.452 --> 14:50.672
- It's not fine.
- You're doing great.

14:50.715 --> 14:53.718
- No, the skin-hardening spell
I keep trying to cast

14:53.762 --> 14:56.417
so I don't get flayed alive
only stuck to the left half

14:56.460 --> 14:58.985
of my body,
and also...

14:59.028 --> 15:00.987
I want to murder everything.

15:01.030 --> 15:03.859
- Oh, uh, more than usual?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.556
- Yes, in fact.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.994
- Well, maybe just some
deep breaths, and you know,

15:08.037 --> 15:09.734
you got this, so--
- Fuck breathing.

15:09.778 --> 15:10.953
I'm too annoyed to breathe.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.173
- Mm.

15:13.216 --> 15:16.872
- But I like you anyway.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.874
Thanks for the cheerleading,
wolf boy.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.703
Uh, of course.

15:21.746 --> 15:23.574
That's fine.

15:25.576 --> 15:27.752
- The air's so thin up here,
I think I'm hallucinating.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.803
We're gonna need to rest
before we go again.

15:34.846 --> 15:37.153
- I just wanna pin
the circle in place.

15:44.813 --> 15:45.770
- Eliot.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.519
Hey, Eliot.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.481
Okay, just...

16:07.792 --> 16:09.707
Okay.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.669
- Eliot, Taker!
Back up!

16:14.712 --> 16:17.106
Q's vial,
you set it down.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.717
- Fuck!
Just stay in the circle.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.110
- Eliot, no!

16:34.689 --> 16:35.777
- Fuck.

17:25.261 --> 17:28.134
- You all right?
- Uh...

17:29.091 --> 17:31.224
- I'm really glad
I took the north trail.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.834
- Pretty sure I'm gladder.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.054
- Who needs a drink?

17:41.190 --> 17:43.323
- Sorry, are you still...

17:44.672 --> 17:44.715
- Oh, yeah, no.
We're just about done here.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.282
Hold on.

17:46.326 --> 17:47.718
- Any luck?

17:47.762 --> 17:49.764
- Yeah, Zoe definitely
went here in the '90s,

17:49.807 --> 17:52.158
but her professors
don't seem to remember her.

17:52.201 --> 17:55.117
She did a lot of field work
in Poland, I guess.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.814
- Zoe Markus?

17:56.858 --> 17:58.468
- Yeah, do you know her?

17:59.556 --> 18:02.298
Well, she was my lab partner.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.431
Oh, my God, we dropped
so much acid together.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.216
- We went to visit her work.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.739
She's a big financial advisor.

18:08.783 --> 18:11.133
- Seriously?

18:11.177 --> 18:12.569
Wow.

18:12.613 --> 18:14.136
I mean, she was really
not into money at all

18:14.180 --> 18:15.442
when I knew her
and her sisters.

18:15.485 --> 18:16.834
- Sisters?

18:16.878 --> 18:18.749
More than one?
- Yeah.

18:18.793 --> 18:23.754
Beth, Zoe, and Dani who--
no offense--is a little weird.

18:23.798 --> 18:26.453
Rumor has it that they averted
apocalypse in senior year.

18:42.469 --> 18:43.513
- They're good.

18:46.168 --> 18:50.346
- Janet of House Pluchinsky,

18:50.390 --> 18:54.350
versus Faun of House
Kaiko Swordmasters.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.879
- Whoo!

19:05.231 --> 19:08.364
- Fencicle of House Wahlburger.

19:19.593 --> 19:20.550
- What?

19:24.424 --> 19:25.773
- Whoa!

19:54.976 --> 19:56.238
- God.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.294
- Goddamn!

20:08.337 --> 20:09.556
- We've been wasting her,
right?

20:09.599 --> 20:10.818
- This is, like,
spy movie perfect.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.254
You're both in the dirty dozen,

20:12.298 --> 20:13.429
and I'm the guy
on the outside.

20:13.473 --> 20:15.910
- Victors, please
approach the dais.

20:17.303 --> 20:18.347
Congratulations.

20:22.569 --> 20:25.659
Fencicle,
what is your persuasion?

20:25.702 --> 20:27.878
- I mostly date humans.

20:27.922 --> 20:29.184
- Are you a female?

20:30.925 --> 20:32.274
And you, Janet?

20:32.318 --> 20:33.754
- Duh.

20:33.797 --> 20:36.974
- There can, of course,
only be one female Centurion.

20:37.018 --> 20:39.412
- And act three twist.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.283
- For all the obvious reasons.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.285
- Um, not obvious to me.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.809
- I know, dear.
That's one of the reasons.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.421
You spar by the light

20:48.464 --> 20:51.598
of the glorious double
full moon tomorrow night.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.382
- Tomorrow night?
- That's no good.

20:53.426 --> 20:54.775
I've got plans.
- Me too.

20:54.818 --> 20:55.950
I mean...

20:55.993 --> 20:59.345
- Oh, gravest apologies,
but the schedule--

20:59.388 --> 21:00.650
- Chucklebuddy,

21:00.694 --> 21:03.305
I have a sexually
transmitted curse.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.655
Sun goes down tomorrow,
I go wolf.

21:05.699 --> 21:06.961
This guy goes wolf.
- Hi.

21:09.050 --> 21:10.486
- Ember's balls.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.621
- And her, too,
for some reason.

21:16.405 --> 21:17.711
That what you want here?

21:17.754 --> 21:18.973
Sure to be entertaining.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.846
Probably be everyone
in here's last show.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.462
Reschedule the mimes.
- Yes, sir.

21:29.505 --> 21:31.028
- Your match will occur

21:31.072 --> 21:33.335
in the hour before
sundown tomorrow.

21:38.819 --> 21:43.302
- Margo, Josh and I only--
six or seven or--

21:43.345 --> 21:46.392
it was less than a dozen times,
give or take,

21:46.435 --> 21:48.002
and we would have never,
ever done it if we had known--

21:48.045 --> 21:49.743
- Excuse me.

21:50.787 --> 21:53.007
I need to sharpen my axe.

21:55.662 --> 21:58.969
- Well, please say something
nice at my funeral.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.889
- So, Loria.

22:07.238 --> 22:09.850
I was making ends meet
selling rare objects.

22:09.893 --> 22:12.374
Of course, when I got there,
I mostly drank.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.855
I think this story's
making me sound much less

22:14.898 --> 22:16.857
mentally well-composed
than I actually am.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.207
- We are literally camping
on the Sadderhorn.

22:21.078 --> 22:24.473
Anyway, I was at the border
when I saw my first Taker.

22:24.517 --> 22:26.519
- That thing you did...

22:26.562 --> 22:30.087
I tried to throw something
at one earlier, and nothing.

22:30.131 --> 22:32.133
- Well, most things don't work.

22:32.176 --> 22:34.875
- Well, the Dark King
can fend them off.

22:34.918 --> 22:37.356
- There are a few of us out
here who figured out ways.

22:37.399 --> 22:38.966
- How?

22:39.009 --> 22:41.403
- When it touched me, it--
it felt like a virus,

22:41.447 --> 22:43.231
a plague.

22:43.274 --> 22:46.103
I shot something off
on instinct, an anti-viral.

22:46.147 --> 22:48.236
- You're a Magician from Earth?

22:48.279 --> 22:51.021
- My family is.

22:51.065 --> 22:53.067
- Well, do you think you can
show us what you did?

22:53.110 --> 22:55.548
- I--I will teach you
whatever I can.

22:55.591 --> 22:59.029
And something else
I can share...

22:59.073 --> 23:01.467
Lucky that the Taker
didn't snatch it.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.426
Thank you.

23:04.470 --> 23:07.821
- Is that Lorian Bumble Wine?
- Uh-huh.

23:07.864 --> 23:10.563
- Cures altitude sickness,
opens the lungs,

23:10.606 --> 23:12.303
and gets you smashed.

23:13.957 --> 23:14.958
Wait, I was gonna--

23:15.002 --> 23:16.177
- I was gonna say,

23:16.220 --> 23:17.134
you should go easy on that.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.049
- Oh, my God.

23:19.093 --> 23:21.356
It's too late now.
I'm sorry.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.966
- Well, cheers to that.
- Mm.

23:25.969 --> 23:27.101
- Mm.

23:27.144 --> 23:30.147
- You're a danger tourist?
- No.

23:30.191 --> 23:31.235
Mourning someone.

23:32.236 --> 23:33.977
- Who was it?

23:34.021 --> 23:35.544
I mean,
if you want to say.

23:35.588 --> 23:36.893
- Well...

23:39.113 --> 23:40.593
The love of my life.

23:40.636 --> 23:43.552
Died ridiculously young,
but he was a Magician,

23:43.596 --> 23:45.162
and there's nothing
more dangerous than that.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.383
My dreams were
so filled with him,

23:48.427 --> 23:50.211
I was convinced
he was haunting me.

23:51.255 --> 23:54.607
So I took his diary up
to the top of the mountain

23:54.650 --> 23:56.565
and threw it in.

23:58.654 --> 24:02.223
I felt a little better,
so who knows?

24:02.266 --> 24:05.400
- But you're here again.
- I come every year.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.401
To honor him.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.230
- My boyfriend died.

24:09.273 --> 24:10.536
Well, my on and off again--

24:10.579 --> 24:13.887
it was--
it's complicated.

24:13.930 --> 24:16.150
I don't like talking about it.

24:16.193 --> 24:17.543
- I understand.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.026
You knew him too?

24:24.375 --> 24:27.291
- Um...good friend.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.513
- It's nice that you
can do this together.

24:31.557 --> 24:34.037
- Yes, cheers to that too.

24:37.998 --> 24:39.608
Well, I think
I should start thinking

24:39.652 --> 24:43.003
about going to lie down so--
my eggs are scrambled.

24:43.046 --> 24:44.352
- They sure are.

24:51.707 --> 24:52.926
- Hi, Daniella?

24:55.189 --> 24:56.669
- Awkward.

24:56.712 --> 24:58.540
- Um, we didn't mean
to scare you.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.281
We just wanted to talk
to you and your sister about--

25:00.324 --> 25:02.022
- What the hell are you doing?

25:02.065 --> 25:03.545
I told you
we can't help you.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.547
- You can, but you won't.
- Hey, look.

25:05.591 --> 25:08.115
We're not asking you
to join the fight.

25:08.158 --> 25:09.029
- We just need
your help in the--

25:09.072 --> 25:10.552
- It's not just.

25:10.596 --> 25:13.163
You think she'll stop
if she knows the stakes?

25:13.947 --> 25:15.383
- Tell me about the problem.
- Don't!

25:15.426 --> 25:17.559
Unless you wanna explain
how obsessed you get,

25:17.603 --> 25:18.560
how you nearly
got yourself killed,

25:18.604 --> 25:20.606
how Beth did get killed.

25:23.696 --> 25:26.176
- Look, we're sorry.
- I'm not.

25:26.220 --> 25:27.569
Look, I get that you've
lost a lot,

25:27.613 --> 25:29.484
but so have we.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.530
We need your help.
I'm just saying--

25:31.573 --> 25:33.401
- We already saved the world,
okay?

25:33.444 --> 25:36.056
We get to be done.

25:36.099 --> 25:37.666
Now get out.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.363
Don't come back.

25:42.628 --> 25:47.067
- There is nothing like
two grieving lunatics

25:47.110 --> 25:50.592
drinking themselves to death
on a mountain of ghosts.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.463
- Cheers.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.465
- Mm.

25:54.509 --> 25:56.555
Oh, it's a good sky tonight.

26:00.515 --> 26:01.603
Please.

26:12.658 --> 26:15.182
- I used to do this with him.

26:15.225 --> 26:19.360
We'd go somewhere,
camp out,

26:19.403 --> 26:23.407
and use illusion magic to
change the color of the stars.

26:26.323 --> 26:27.977
- Sounds perfect.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.596
- Have you ever had love?

26:42.252 --> 26:44.385
- Love?
Uh, like--

26:44.428 --> 26:46.256
- Love.
It's okay.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.302
You can say anything.

26:48.345 --> 26:50.043
I'm a stranger
and you're drunk.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.399
- The friend
we're putting to rest.

27:00.096 --> 27:01.663
- Wasn't just a friend.

27:03.578 --> 27:06.668
Does she know?
- Oh, God, no.

27:06.712 --> 27:09.497
- A torrid secret affair.

27:09.540 --> 27:12.152
- Nothing like that.

27:12.195 --> 27:13.501
- Hmm.

27:13.544 --> 27:14.720
It seems a bit selfish, then.

27:16.547 --> 27:19.550
I'm just saying that seems
rather important information

27:19.594 --> 27:22.118
that he can't give her.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.077
- I mean,
why punish her like that?

27:24.120 --> 27:26.427
- Why spare her?

27:26.470 --> 27:28.211
You don't seem close.

27:29.212 --> 27:32.085
- Because she really,
really loved him.

27:32.128 --> 27:33.652
- So did you.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.088
- Yeah.

27:35.131 --> 27:37.177
So I don't her want to think--

27:37.220 --> 27:40.136
- Have you ever noticed
that people generally

27:40.180 --> 27:41.703
think what the hell they want?

27:41.747 --> 27:43.487
- I'm starting to think that

27:43.531 --> 27:45.098
you're a little bit
of a shit-stirrer.

27:48.579 --> 27:51.191
I just fundamentally believe
that the best way

27:51.234 --> 27:53.497
to honor someone
is with the truth of them.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.369
You could give her more
of that truth,

27:55.412 --> 27:56.849
but you won't.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.415
- I just want everybody
to remember Quentin

27:58.459 --> 27:59.721
however they want to

27:59.765 --> 28:02.419
and to--to get through
the fucking day.

28:02.463 --> 28:04.857
- I'm just pointing out,

28:04.900 --> 28:07.598
what you've got
in that secret pocket

28:07.642 --> 28:10.253
could help her remember
the real Quentin.

28:18.435 --> 28:20.742
Death is so simple,

28:20.786 --> 28:24.224
and life is so complicated.

28:24.267 --> 28:25.747
I know.

28:32.449 --> 28:34.669
Well...

28:34.713 --> 28:37.716
I should go to bed.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.892
- Before things get
any more complicated.

28:51.251 --> 28:53.340
- Years ago,

28:54.645 --> 28:57.344
the Dark King, in a show
of progressiveness,

28:57.387 --> 28:59.738
allowed that there
might be a female

28:59.781 --> 29:03.045
among his Centurions
if one proved worthy.

29:04.786 --> 29:09.269
This year we have two
competitors of the weaker sex.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.011
I know, I know.

29:12.054 --> 29:14.230
- Or you could walk away.
- Can't.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.754
This is for Fillory.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.886
- You're a little wolf crazy
right now, and mad.

29:17.930 --> 29:19.322
You might actually kill her.

29:19.366 --> 29:21.107
- I know how to properly
lightly maim someone.

29:21.150 --> 29:22.673
Thanks for your concern.

29:23.849 --> 29:26.895
- Janet Fencicle,
let the battle commence!

29:33.989 --> 29:35.686
You smell anxious.

29:35.730 --> 29:38.907
- And you smell angry,
so please let me stab you.

29:38.951 --> 29:42.258
- You are out of your mind.
- Margo, please.

29:42.302 --> 29:45.000
- Actually worked.

29:45.044 --> 29:46.393
- That's no fair,
'cause you can do magic.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.177
- You can do that
twirly knife shit.

29:48.221 --> 29:50.179
- You have an axe.
- Fine.

29:50.223 --> 29:52.007
No magic.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.805
- Magic.

30:06.848 --> 30:08.328
Oops.

30:25.214 --> 30:28.130
- We have a victor--
a victorette.

30:31.177 --> 30:34.310
Your new lady Centurion.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.011
- I'm so sorry, Fen.

30:48.107 --> 30:50.761
That was so well played!

30:50.805 --> 30:53.895
How you knew to grab my knife.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.244
- Did I know that?

30:55.288 --> 30:56.202
- Of course you did.
Childsplay knife.

30:56.245 --> 30:57.507
Perfectly safe.

30:57.551 --> 30:58.857
We make them for children
so they can practice.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.906
Sir, can you please bring us
to the werewolf cages?

31:04.950 --> 31:06.342
Quickly?
Thanks.

31:19.399 --> 31:22.097
- I think I'll take
the east view.

31:22.141 --> 31:24.404
I'll find you later if you want
to hike down together.

31:46.513 --> 31:48.210
- I'll just give you a moment.

31:49.342 --> 31:50.865
- No, stay.

31:54.216 --> 31:55.914
You cared about him too.

32:04.270 --> 32:07.055
- Do you think it goes all
the way down to the Underworld?

32:07.099 --> 32:09.840
- I hope so,
for Q.

32:18.371 --> 32:20.286
Is there anything
you want to say to him?

32:31.993 --> 32:33.299
Rest.

32:39.305 --> 32:41.133
Okay, I think we can go now.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.441
- Wait, there's one more thing.

32:45.485 --> 32:47.356
Uh...

32:57.497 --> 32:59.368
- Wait, this stamp
is enchanted.

33:02.458 --> 33:06.071
You could send this to him.
- Mm-hmm.

33:06.114 --> 33:08.551
- Before--
oh, my God, Eliot.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.468
You didn't send it 'cause
you were worried it could be--

33:12.512 --> 33:14.035
- So much worse
if I changed it.

33:16.951 --> 33:20.607
- Alice...
- Huh?

33:20.650 --> 33:24.045
- Is there a way that we
could really, truly know?

33:24.089 --> 33:26.961
- Eliot, I really don't know.

33:30.486 --> 33:33.663
- S--sometimes I just wish
if you all just went faster,

33:33.707 --> 33:34.664
if you just...

33:36.144 --> 33:38.233
Just locked the fucking door.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.453
- No, because Everett
would still--

33:40.496 --> 33:42.150
- Right, Everett.
Of course.

33:44.109 --> 33:46.328
Q...

33:46.372 --> 33:48.330
If Q hadn't stopped
Everett, then...

33:48.374 --> 33:50.332
- So many more people
could die.

33:50.376 --> 33:53.509
- But I just keep thinking if--
if I can just crack the code

33:53.553 --> 33:54.684
then--then we can fix it.

33:54.728 --> 33:56.034
- I don't think there's
a perfect code

33:56.077 --> 33:58.297
for changing the past.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.212
- I can't send it,

34:00.255 --> 34:03.476
but I--I can't just let go.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.000
- It's okay.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.089
He was your friend.

34:08.133 --> 34:10.309
He wasn't just my friend.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.493
I'm sorry.

34:22.669 --> 34:24.453
He loved you.

34:24.497 --> 34:27.108
I--why would I want to take
that away from you now?

34:27.152 --> 34:28.501
That would be so cruel.

34:30.329 --> 34:32.244
- You really think
I didn't know there was more?

34:38.598 --> 34:40.948
I knew Q really well.

34:42.210 --> 34:44.212
And if anyone was messy,
it was him.

34:46.562 --> 34:47.433
both: Yeah.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.959
- He was pretty
in love with you.

34:54.179 --> 34:55.745
- I'm not sure
that I'd say that.

34:55.789 --> 34:56.703
- I would.

34:59.793 --> 35:03.101
What was I supposed to do, huh?

35:03.144 --> 35:05.103
Demand that he only love me?

35:07.453 --> 35:10.238
Scream at him to be
a less complicated person?

35:10.282 --> 35:12.110
I mean, it's Quentin
we're talking about.

35:14.721 --> 35:17.071
And I loved him.

35:19.465 --> 35:22.294
The real him,
all of him.

35:25.297 --> 35:28.300
- Well, um,
there's something

35:28.343 --> 35:29.649
he probably didn't
tell you about.

35:29.692 --> 35:32.478
The mosaic.

35:33.696 --> 35:37.526
Um, there was this timeline.

35:39.354 --> 35:43.445
We somehow remembered
pieces of it,

35:43.489 --> 35:45.621
but these, uh--
these beautiful pieces,

35:45.665 --> 35:48.102
and it was...

35:48.146 --> 35:52.367
We loved each other
for a really, really long time,

35:52.411 --> 35:55.762
and, um, so, you know, uh,

35:55.805 --> 35:57.503
I promptly told him
to fuck off,

35:57.546 --> 36:00.549
and--and, you know,
he--he--he died for me.

36:08.731 --> 36:09.732
- Eliot.

36:12.474 --> 36:16.086
Eliot, I have done...

36:19.177 --> 36:22.658
A lot of bad things,
and I have hurt people, okay?

36:22.702 --> 36:25.487
And the one thing that
I hold onto is that I know,

36:25.531 --> 36:29.230
deep down,
that I was doing my best.

36:29.274 --> 36:31.754
Were you doing
the best that you could?

36:31.798 --> 36:34.235
- Unfortunately at the time...

36:35.889 --> 36:37.325
Yes.

36:39.719 --> 36:41.851
I never even got
to talk to him again.

36:41.895 --> 36:44.376
He just died.

36:44.419 --> 36:47.205
- I'm sorry.

36:47.248 --> 36:50.251
- Yeah, file it under things
I wish I could say

36:50.295 --> 36:52.819
in this fucking letter
that I can't actually send.

36:55.474 --> 36:57.215
But I can't let go of it,
either.

36:58.912 --> 37:01.262
- You want my help?

37:05.353 --> 37:06.136
- Yeah.

37:08.835 --> 37:10.445
- But we can do it
together, okay?

37:10.489 --> 37:12.621
- Okay.

37:12.665 --> 37:15.363
- On the count of three.

37:17.278 --> 37:19.193
Okay.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.891
- One.
- One.

37:21.935 --> 37:24.285
- Two.
- Two.

37:24.329 --> 37:25.591
- Three.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.777
That was brave.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.910
- He was brave.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.347
- You were brave.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.707
- Eliot?

37:54.750 --> 37:56.186
- Yeah?

37:56.230 --> 37:58.537
- Thank you for telling me.

38:09.809 --> 38:12.072
- Guards, hello!
We're human again!

38:15.031 --> 38:16.337
- Margo.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.599
Can I say one thing?

38:19.384 --> 38:22.778
I'm sorry I slept with Josh.

38:22.822 --> 38:26.216
We were just lonely.
- Fen, stop apologizing.

38:27.261 --> 38:29.959
I don't own Josh's penis,
and I don't want to.

38:32.440 --> 38:33.920
- But you seem--

38:33.963 --> 38:35.922
- Can I have
a complicated emotion

38:35.965 --> 38:39.055
without having to resolve it
so you can feel better?

38:41.319 --> 38:44.757
- I am grateful that even
in your complicated state,

38:44.800 --> 38:47.107
you still reached
for the Childsplay knife.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.282
You're a good person--

38:48.326 --> 38:49.849
- I thought it
was a real knife.

38:52.286 --> 38:56.769
Glad it wasn't today,
but I'm not a good person.

38:56.812 --> 38:59.380
- Okay, well,

38:59.424 --> 39:01.730
matters of the heart
can be irrational

39:01.774 --> 39:03.036
and sometimes even
the best of us--

39:03.079 --> 39:05.125
- Stop trying to forgive me.

39:05.168 --> 39:08.346
- We want you to forgive us.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.304
We promised ourselves
we wouldn't give up on you,

39:10.348 --> 39:12.393
but we did.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.917
You never gave up on us.

39:14.961 --> 39:15.875
- Yeah, you figured out a way.

39:15.918 --> 39:18.791
- Eliot sent the letter.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.793
I was gonna let you die
for Fillory but...

39:23.186 --> 39:24.405
Kings.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.931
We have a job,

39:28.975 --> 39:31.281
and we put it first, right?

39:33.849 --> 39:36.112
- So...

39:36.156 --> 39:39.159
you didn't save us,

39:39.202 --> 39:40.378
and then you stabbed me.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.817
Am I a fool?

39:44.860 --> 39:46.775
No--no, really.
Am I?

39:46.819 --> 39:47.776
- No more than me.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.082
- You're a lovesick idiot!

39:49.125 --> 39:50.344
- Hey!

39:50.388 --> 39:52.825
- I went into battle for you

39:52.868 --> 39:55.784
thinking that you gave
a single flea on a donkey's ass

39:55.828 --> 39:57.438
for any of us,

39:57.482 --> 39:59.745
thinking that we
owed you something.

40:02.356 --> 40:03.401
Stupid me.

40:19.460 --> 40:23.246
- I've been thinking
about what Zoe said.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.248
It's a valid question.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.120
When do you save
the world enough?

40:29.557 --> 40:31.472
- Look, I'm--I'm with you
on anything,

40:31.516 --> 40:33.343
but I gotta be honest.

40:33.387 --> 40:34.997
If we survive this one,

40:35.041 --> 40:37.826
I want a life, Julia.

40:37.870 --> 40:39.437
Ideally, with you.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.047
- Yeah, I want that too.

40:41.090 --> 40:43.528
- I'm not sure you do,
and tha--and that's okay.

40:43.571 --> 40:45.051
Right now we got shit to do,

40:45.094 --> 40:47.401
but if we don't die,

40:47.445 --> 40:48.837
we gotta figure this out.

40:51.318 --> 40:52.450
- Hello.

40:53.407 --> 40:55.409
I solved your problem.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.933
You were right.
Surges are increasing.

40:57.977 --> 40:59.195
They're unpredictable--

40:59.239 --> 41:01.067
hidden variables
that defy calculation.

41:01.110 --> 41:03.025
- But if we can't predict it--
- Correct.

41:03.069 --> 41:04.549
You can't.

41:04.592 --> 41:07.290
So instead,
I created a statistical model

41:07.334 --> 41:09.945
to predict a window within
which a surge might occur.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.557
- Wow.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.472
Okay, this is a start.

41:14.515 --> 41:17.300
- Are you familiar with
the Harmonic Convergence?

41:17.344 --> 41:18.911
- No.

41:18.954 --> 41:21.435
- A rare and powerful
astrological occurrence.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.958
A magnifier of magic.

41:23.002 --> 41:24.177
There have been four.

41:24.220 --> 41:27.136
Extinction of the dinosaurs,
Pompeii,

41:27.180 --> 41:31.445
sinking of Atlantis,
and the invention of Auto-Tune.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.142
In two weeks,
there will be a fifth.

41:33.186 --> 41:34.361
- How bad will it be?

41:34.404 --> 41:37.146
- This is the event
you're worried about.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.583
Circumstances
on the Convergence

41:38.626 --> 41:40.367
will be exceptionally
favorable,

41:40.410 --> 41:43.109
which in this case
is not a good thing,

41:43.152 --> 41:44.545
because it falls
in a surge window.

41:46.416 --> 41:48.462
Castings will be exponentially
magnified.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.029
Enchantments will malfunction.

41:50.072 --> 41:51.334
Death toll in the millions.

41:51.378 --> 41:53.206
Maybe much higher.
- How can we stop it?

41:53.249 --> 41:56.122
- You can't,
unless you stop the surges,

41:56.165 --> 41:57.863
change astrology,

41:57.906 --> 42:00.082
or tell everyone on Earth
not to do magic.

42:00.126 --> 42:01.562
Whatever you try,
if you need help,

42:01.606 --> 42:02.563
I will help you.

42:03.608 --> 42:05.000
And so will my sister.

42:05.044 --> 42:07.089
- I'm pretty sure
she doesn't want to.

42:07.133 --> 42:10.528
- She doesn't,
but if the moment comes,

42:10.571 --> 42:12.268
you can count on
the both of us.

42:12.312 --> 42:14.357
- Wait. Dani.

42:14.401 --> 42:16.403
Thank you so much
for your help.

42:16.446 --> 42:17.535
- My pleasure.

42:19.014 --> 42:20.538
My sister will invoice you
for my time.

42:25.325 --> 42:28.981
- Well, we go that-a-way.

42:29.024 --> 42:32.375
A tree near Whitespire
can take us home.

42:32.419 --> 42:36.249
- I'm headed in that direction,
if you'd like some company.

42:36.989 --> 42:38.643
- Um, yeah.
- We wouldn't mind.

42:40.166 --> 42:42.603
- Make way!

42:45.040 --> 42:46.912
- Is that the Dark King's
carriage?

42:50.219 --> 42:52.526
- Are we in trouble again?

42:52.570 --> 42:54.049
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

43:11.327 --> 43:13.895
- Would you like a ride
to Whitespire?

43:14.592 --> 43:15.680
- Uh...
- I think we'll walk.

43:15.723 --> 43:18.639
- Um...

43:18.683 --> 43:21.990
- I hope your journey gave you
everything that you needed.

43:23.122 --> 43:24.427
Please call on me

43:24.471 --> 43:26.647
if there's ever anything
I can do for you.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.265
- He's...

43:39.138 --> 43:41.923
- I think I almost
fucked the Dark King.
