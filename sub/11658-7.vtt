00:58.467 --> 01:00.700
Ma, what do you
think you're doing?

01:00.767 --> 01:02.233
It's a funny little
habit I picked up.

01:02.300 --> 01:03.667
I call it eating.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.233
Rose made this
for her daughter.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.767
You shouldn't eat it
until she gets here.

01:08.834 --> 01:10.266
Please, there's
enough food here

01:10.333 --> 01:12.433
to feed my entire
village in Sicily.

01:14.467 --> 01:15.333
Blanche!

01:15.400 --> 01:16.834
Dorothy, can you help me
to the chair?

01:16.900 --> 01:18.367
Oh, my back gave out.

01:18.433 --> 01:20.800
I figured that would've been
the third thing to go.

01:21.767 --> 01:23.600
Honey, what happened?

01:23.667 --> 01:25.367
I was in aerobics class

01:25.433 --> 01:28.100
when I noticed this gorgeous man
checking me out.

01:28.166 --> 01:31.033
During buttocks lifts,
he motioned for my phone number.

01:31.100 --> 01:34.033
I didn't want to appear easy,
so I rolled over on my back

01:34.100 --> 01:35.867
and flung my legs
over my head.

01:37.300 --> 01:39.667
That's what I call
giving him the brush-off.

01:41.567 --> 01:43.266
(doorbell rings)

01:45.567 --> 01:48.166
-Hi, Mom.
-My God, it is Michael!

01:48.233 --> 01:51.300
Oh, Michael.
Look, Ma, it's Michael.

01:51.367 --> 01:54.467
Honey, what a surprise.
You look great.

01:54.533 --> 01:57.166
Am I glad to see you.
I've missed you so.

01:57.233 --> 01:59.734
Why the hell haven't you written,
you ingrate?

02:01.033 --> 02:03.166
He's a big-time musician.

02:03.233 --> 02:05.233
You think he has time
to write letters home?

02:05.300 --> 02:07.233
-Hi, Grandma.
-Don't "hi" me.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.900
You can't pick up a phone
and call your own grandmother?

02:11.100 --> 02:12.900
You look terrific.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.500
I know.
So give me a kiss already.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.567
I want you to meet Blanche.

02:18.633 --> 02:20.533
This is my son Michael.

02:20.600 --> 02:24.667
I'd get up, but I've thrown my back
out. What happened was--

02:24.734 --> 02:26.066
Oh, you don't have to explain.

02:26.133 --> 02:28.200
My mother already told me
all about you.

02:30.467 --> 02:33.066
Why didn't you tell us
you were coming?

02:33.133 --> 02:35.100
I could've cooked
your favorite meals.

02:35.166 --> 02:38.767
My jazz club job ended early,
so I decided to visit.

02:38.834 --> 02:41.767
-Oh, I'm so glad you did.
-You play jazz?

02:41.834 --> 02:45.300
Child prodigy. The only white boy
from Brooklyn who could scat.

02:45.367 --> 02:49.400
I thought the job was supposed
to last for the summer.

02:49.467 --> 02:52.166
I had artistic differences
with the club owner.

02:52.233 --> 02:54.734
People pick on him
because he's talented.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.834
He fired me because
I refused to wear a tie.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.900
Michael stands up
for his principles.

03:00.967 --> 03:03.967
He's the Norma Rae
of the music business.

03:04.033 --> 03:08.300
Everybody, I want you to
meet my daughter Bridget.

03:08.367 --> 03:10.533
-Bridget, this is Blanche.
-Hi.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.667
And Dorothy and Sophia
and a total stranger.

03:15.800 --> 03:19.433
This is my son Michael.
He'll be staying with us a while.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.834
Ma, you don't have the space.

03:21.900 --> 03:24.000
You can have my room.

03:24.066 --> 03:26.500
With my bad back,
I'll just camp out on the couch.

03:26.567 --> 03:28.233
It's nice meeting you.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.166
Dorothy's told us
so much about you.

03:30.233 --> 03:32.200
-This is my daughter Bridget.
-Hello.

03:32.266 --> 03:34.633
Bridget's going to study at Oxford.

03:34.700 --> 03:37.033
I found a terrific flat on campus.

03:37.100 --> 03:40.133
I hear the commute
from here is a killer.

03:40.633 --> 03:41.533
Pardon me?

03:41.600 --> 03:42.900
It was a joke.

03:42.967 --> 03:44.000
Cute.

03:44.066 --> 03:45.600
Where do you go to school?

03:45.667 --> 03:49.500
I attend the school of life.

03:49.567 --> 03:51.233
Really?
A lot of people go there

03:51.300 --> 03:54.033
when they can't get
accepted anywhere else.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.300
Cute.

03:55.367 --> 03:58.166
I know you're hungry.

03:58.233 --> 04:00.066
I fixed all your favorite things.

04:00.133 --> 04:01.333
It looks delicious.

04:01.400 --> 04:05.100
Where are the little wooden shoes
I carved out of cheese?

04:06.767 --> 04:08.900
My mother spread them on
the tiny windmill

04:08.967 --> 04:10.700
you built out of triscuits.

04:17.367 --> 04:20.000
Mom, this is the best breakfast
I've had in ages.

04:20.066 --> 04:20.967
Me, too, Dorothy.

04:21.033 --> 04:24.533
When we're alone, she feeds me
lumpy oatmeal and black bananas.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.767
-Mom, I'll do that.
-No, you will not.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.667
-You don't have to clean up after me.
-I enjoy doing it.

04:32.734 --> 04:35.000
Here.
Why not double your fun?

04:39.066 --> 04:40.834
-Good morning, everybody.
-Hi, Blanche.

04:40.900 --> 04:42.433
-Honey, how's your back?
-Terrible.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.567
What'd the doctor say?

04:43.633 --> 04:44.734
Well, after commenting

04:44.800 --> 04:48.000
that I am the most
spectacular specimen he has seen

04:48.066 --> 04:50.834
since miss Julie Newmar,
he said I have a back problem.

04:50.900 --> 04:53.100
Thank God
you went to a specialist.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.734
He said no physical
activity for a week.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.266
I have to wear a corset

04:57.333 --> 04:59.600
and stay on my back
with my legs elevated.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.667
That's the same thing
you did last Saturday.

05:03.867 --> 05:06.900
Just follow the doctor's orders,
and everything will be fine.

05:06.967 --> 05:09.400
I cannot possibly go
without physical activity

05:09.467 --> 05:10.967
for an entire week.

05:11.033 --> 05:12.633
I have serious needs.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.266
After all, I'm at my sexual peak.

05:14.333 --> 05:17.400
-Blanche.
-I am, Dorothy. A woman's sexual--

05:17.467 --> 05:20.000
Blanche, this is my child.

05:20.066 --> 05:22.633
I'm not a child.
Don't treat me like one.

05:22.700 --> 05:25.367
I don't treat you like one.

05:25.433 --> 05:28.200
Here's $10.
Take your grandmother

05:28.266 --> 05:30.133
to see <i>The Journey of Natty Gann.</i>

05:31.133 --> 05:32.567
Shut up and take the money.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.633
The hell with the movie.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.000
We'll double our money at the track,

05:37.066 --> 05:39.600
have a nice lunch
and goof on bums.

05:42.066 --> 05:44.367
Michael seems like
such a nice young man.

05:44.433 --> 05:47.734
Oh, he really is,
but I'm worried about him.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.133
He's always been a little flighty.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.300
I wouldn't worry about that.

05:51.367 --> 05:53.834
Grandma Hollingsworth always said
I was a little flighty...

05:54.533 --> 05:56.000
or was it a little floozy?

05:59.834 --> 06:00.767
Morning, everyone.

06:00.834 --> 06:03.233
-Hi, Rose. Want some breakfast?
-No, thanks.

06:03.300 --> 06:04.800
Bridget packed a delicious meal

06:04.867 --> 06:06.400
and drove me to the Country
for breakfast.

06:06.467 --> 06:09.533
We took a walk
and picked wildflowers,

06:09.600 --> 06:12.033
and we rolled up our pant legs
and waded in the creek.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.266
And then guess what.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.834
Julie Andrews showed up,

06:14.900 --> 06:18.533
you all fed deer from your hand
and sang "If I had a hammer."

06:21.800 --> 06:24.533
Rose, sounds like
you had a lovely morning.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.033
Oh, it was,
but it made me a little sad.

06:28.100 --> 06:30.533
I realized how much
I'm going to miss her.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.233
We've always been so close.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.834
I used to be the same way
with Michael.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.400
Used to be? I thought
you got along great.

06:37.467 --> 06:40.000
No. It's not that
we don't get along.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.533
We just think so differently.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.500
I think it is time he settled down
and found a job.

06:45.567 --> 06:47.867
He thinks he should be
traveling over the country

06:47.934 --> 06:49.767
trying to find himself.

06:50.266 --> 06:52.600
Maybe Michael needs
a little exposure.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.133
Exposure to what?

06:54.200 --> 06:56.066
To plutonium, Rose.

06:57.867 --> 07:00.333
To somebody
more career-oriented.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.934
Somebody like Bridget.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.834
Maybe if they spent
some time together,

07:03.900 --> 07:05.433
she'd be a positive influence.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.367
Are you suggesting they go out?

07:08.433 --> 07:10.333
That is exactly what I'm suggesting.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.667
I don't think so, Blanche.

07:11.734 --> 07:14.867
I learned to stay out of
my children's social lives.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.734
I agree with Rose.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.100
It's like that old
Scandinavian saying.

07:19.166 --> 07:20.700
"You can lead a herring to water,

07:20.767 --> 07:23.467
but you have to walk
really fast or he'll die."

07:33.633 --> 07:35.200
All right. Fine.

07:36.033 --> 07:38.667
I just thought they'd have
more fun going out together

07:38.734 --> 07:41.433
instead of hanging around here
with me and three old ladies.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.800
I'm gonna get changed too.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.834
Bridget's gonna take me
to the house of fabrics.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.600
They're having a big felt sale.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.734
I hope I just don't get
too crazy.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.033
You better take a tranquilizer
before you go.

07:56.133 --> 07:57.934
Remember, last time
you hyperventilated

07:58.000 --> 07:59.633
and almost passed out.

07:59.700 --> 08:02.900
I never passed out
at the house of fabrics.

08:02.967 --> 08:04.900
I passed out
at the world of wool.

08:10.433 --> 08:14.133
Girls, for the first time
in my life, my body feels old.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.900
I feel like I can't do
the same things I used to.

08:16.967 --> 08:19.467
Rubber woman couldn't do
the same things you used to.

08:21.333 --> 08:25.500
Honey, it's only natural that as
you grow older, your body changes.

08:25.567 --> 08:28.300
-It falls apart.
-Oh, it does not fall apart.

08:28.367 --> 08:30.667
For 50 years, I had
the body of Chita Rivera.

08:30.734 --> 08:31.967
One morning I woke up,

08:32.033 --> 08:34.100
my butt looked like
the neck of a bulldog.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.333
I remember the first time
I felt I was getting older.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.100
I was visiting my daughter
in New York.

08:44.166 --> 08:47.133
She had one of those walk-up
apartments, five flights up.

08:47.200 --> 08:51.400
Oh, it got harder and harder
each year to climb those stairs,

08:51.467 --> 08:54.934
and finally one year, I couldn't
make it without stopping.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.800
Oh, it depressed me for weeks.

08:56.867 --> 08:59.800
Oh, my God, is that what
I have to look forward to

08:59.867 --> 09:01.433
15 years from now?

09:07.100 --> 09:08.667
How about another game,
Dorothy?

09:08.734 --> 09:10.834
I don't feel like it.
Why don't you play with Michael?

09:10.900 --> 09:12.600
-He's not here.
-Oh? Where is he?

09:12.667 --> 09:15.000
While you and Sophia
were at the market,

09:15.066 --> 09:16.767
the kids decided to go out.

09:16.834 --> 09:19.533
-What, Michael asked Bridget out?
-Well, not exactly, no.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.800
I just happened to have some
free tickets to the Symphony,

09:21.867 --> 09:25.400
and they were sitting around here
bored so I suggested they take them.

09:25.467 --> 09:27.500
Blanche, both Rose and I told you

09:27.567 --> 09:29.934
not to interfere
with their social lives.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.200
I know it. I just thought
it might be fun for them.

09:32.266 --> 09:34.667
Being set up on a date is never fun.

09:34.734 --> 09:38.433
In Sicily, everything is set up,
dates, marriage, death.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.834
Especially death.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.967
That's why whenever I go
into a restaurant,

09:43.033 --> 09:47.400
I sit with my back to the wall
except any diner in Newark,

09:47.467 --> 09:49.533
where if you're
against the wall, you stick.

09:56.500 --> 09:57.600
Hi, Blanche.

09:58.467 --> 09:59.934
Shouldn't you be lying down?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.400
Yes, but I'm tired
of being on my back.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.367
Did I just say that?

10:05.633 --> 10:07.533
Are the kids back
from their date?

10:07.600 --> 10:08.667
-Our kids?
-No, Rose.

10:08.734 --> 10:12.400
The Katzenjammer kids.
Of course, our kids.

10:12.467 --> 10:15.033
I thought we decided not
to interfere in their lives.

10:15.100 --> 10:18.233
We did, but Blanche
decided differently.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.834
Oh, Blanche, how could you?

10:19.900 --> 10:21.400
What's all the fuss about?

10:21.467 --> 10:23.567
It wasn't official.
They went to the Symphony.

10:23.633 --> 10:25.800
I heard them come in hours ago.

10:25.867 --> 10:27.600
I think I'll say good night
to Bridget.

10:27.667 --> 10:30.133
Would you bring my heating pad
on my dresser?

10:30.200 --> 10:31.266
Sure.

10:31.333 --> 10:34.834
Do you realize
it's been four days

10:34.900 --> 10:36.734
since I've enjoyed
the company of a man?

10:37.767 --> 10:38.767
I know, Blanche.

10:38.834 --> 10:42.600
I've been marking the days off on
my "big ships of the navy" calendar.

10:44.967 --> 10:47.333
I can't stand it much longer.

10:47.400 --> 10:51.033
My body feels like a corvette
up on blocks with its engine racing,

10:51.100 --> 10:54.834
the wheels spinning and spinning
with nowhere to go.

10:54.900 --> 10:57.900
I feel like I'm going to explode!
You have to help me.

10:57.967 --> 11:00.166
-You have to do something.
-There's nothing I can do,

11:00.233 --> 11:03.100
so get that look out of your eye
and let go of my arm.

11:04.734 --> 11:06.500
(Rose) Oh, my God!

11:13.767 --> 11:14.834
Hi there.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.734
Oh, girls. Don't look.

11:28.233 --> 11:31.066
Michael, get out
of that bed right now.

11:31.133 --> 11:32.500
Mom, I'd like to,

11:32.567 --> 11:35.633
but since my clothes
are on the doorknob,

11:35.700 --> 11:37.433
I don't think
it's a good idea.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.767
Oh, my God.
They're naked.

11:43.233 --> 11:46.633
People usually are
in this situation, Rose.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.633
Unless they're all dressed up
in costumes.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.934
-Sorry.
-What's all the commotion?

11:55.867 --> 11:57.467
Oh, boy.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.934
Grandma,
this isn't what it looks like.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.667
I may not remember
what it feels like,

12:02.734 --> 12:05.033
but I sure as hell remember
what it looks like.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.133
-Grandma, listen--
-You listen.

12:11.200 --> 12:15.100
How dare you come into our home
and act like a common gigolo.

12:15.166 --> 12:17.800
You've embarrassed me,
your mother, our friends,

12:17.867 --> 12:20.367
not to mention that poor,
stupid flat-chested girl.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.934
You've broken my heart.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.533
I'm ashamed to call you
my grandson.

12:27.433 --> 12:28.867
Now look what you've done.

12:28.934 --> 12:30.433
I hope you're proud of yourself.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.834
Bridget,
I am shocked at your behavior.

12:32.900 --> 12:35.166
Why doesn't everybody
just calm down?

12:35.233 --> 12:38.066
They're adults. They went out.
They had a great time.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.433
It was nice.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.100
I wouldn't call it great.

12:42.734 --> 12:44.633
Sorry. Too much wine.

12:45.633 --> 12:48.100
Would you like us to leave
so you can try it again?

12:49.400 --> 12:52.533
Dorothy, I don't think
we should encourage them.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.767
Why don't we just
let the kids get dressed.

12:54.834 --> 12:57.967
Then we can discuss this
like rational human beings.

12:58.033 --> 12:59.967
That's a good idea,
Blanche.

13:02.033 --> 13:04.967
Rose, I meant let them
get dressed in private.

13:05.934 --> 13:07.500
Oh, sorry.

13:08.533 --> 13:10.233
I guess I'm still in shock.

13:10.300 --> 13:13.166
I've never seen Bridget
in bed with a man before,

13:13.233 --> 13:15.000
except Raggedy Andy.

13:20.767 --> 13:24.133
-I just can't believe it.
-Believe it, Rose.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.033
You know how it is when
you can't believe something?

13:27.100 --> 13:29.600
I can't believe Alan Thicke
has a hit series,

13:29.667 --> 13:31.367
but that doesn't mean
it isn't so.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.934
-I blame you, Blanche.
-What did I do?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.400
If you hadn't
suggested that date,

13:37.467 --> 13:39.200
Michael wouldn't
have seduced my daughter.

13:39.266 --> 13:41.667
What?
He didn't seduce her.

13:41.734 --> 13:44.066
-You were there?
-I happen to know he didn't.

13:44.133 --> 13:45.800
-How?
-Bridget isn't his type.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.200
Of course, she isn't.
She's too good for him.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.533
How about a nice glass
of lemonade?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.867
Not now.
What do you mean?

13:55.934 --> 13:57.500
He doesn't even have a job.

13:57.567 --> 13:59.166
Neither does Henry Kissinger,
really,

13:59.233 --> 14:01.133
but he's still very highly regarded.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.100
My son is an artist.

14:04.166 --> 14:06.500
That's a nice way
of saying he's a loser.

14:07.667 --> 14:09.166
My son is not a loser.

14:09.233 --> 14:11.066
He happens to be very talented.

14:11.133 --> 14:13.734
Yes, at taking advantage
of poor young girls.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.800
See, you both agree.
He does have talent.

14:16.900 --> 14:20.834
Rose, face it. Bridget moves faster
than Marcus Allen.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.333
I can't face it.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.066
I don't even know
who Marcus Allen is.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.533
Then let me put it to you
another way.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.467
When will you face the fact

14:30.533 --> 14:33.834
your daughter is not the
goody-two-shoes you think she is?

14:33.900 --> 14:35.133
What do you mean?

14:35.200 --> 14:37.233
Rose, what would you call a girl

14:37.300 --> 14:40.200
who sleeps with a man
she has known for one day?

14:40.266 --> 14:41.567
A damn good sport?

14:47.200 --> 14:49.867
-I call her a tramp.
-What?

14:49.934 --> 14:52.867
You heard me, tramp.
Tramp, tramp, tramp.

14:52.934 --> 14:55.300
We have always
had our differences,

14:55.367 --> 14:59.400
but I don't think you've ever said
anything so vicious or so cruel.

14:59.467 --> 15:02.467
I don't believe I'll ever be able
to speak to you again.

15:02.533 --> 15:04.367
-Dorothy, go after her.
-I will not.

15:04.433 --> 15:07.433
I'm not the only one who was cruel
and vicious. I have feelings too.

15:07.500 --> 15:08.233
(door slams)

15:16.033 --> 15:18.467
-Morning, Dorothy.
-I'm not talking to you.

15:18.533 --> 15:20.967
You're still upset with me
about last night?

15:21.033 --> 15:23.100
No, I'm upset because
Crockett and Tubbs

15:23.166 --> 15:25.367
are wearing darker colors.

15:26.767 --> 15:27.900
Good morning.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.934
Ma, why are you
dressed like that?

15:35.033 --> 15:37.467
I'm introducing
my new line of tennis wear.

15:38.667 --> 15:40.100
What do you think?
I'm in mourning.

15:40.166 --> 15:42.166
-For whom, Sophia?
-Michael.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.400
After last night,
he doesn't exist.

15:45.467 --> 15:47.700
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't see you there.

15:50.066 --> 15:51.367
(Blanche) Morning, Rose.

15:53.133 --> 15:55.367
I guess you're still mad
at me too, huh?

15:56.166 --> 15:57.333
That's right.

15:57.400 --> 16:01.800
Nobody could be more upset
about what happened than I am.

16:01.867 --> 16:06.000
I was just being hospitable,
I swear.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.734
I sent the kids
to the Symphony

16:07.800 --> 16:11.300
to hear Mr. Henry Mancini's tribute
to <i>The Pink Panther.</i>

16:11.367 --> 16:13.700
I didn't expect them to come back
here and jump into bed.

16:14.967 --> 16:18.166
Besides,
it's not the end of the world.

16:18.233 --> 16:19.934
You know, these things do happen.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.033
Why, the same thing happened to me
when I was in my early 20s.

16:23.100 --> 16:27.033
I was taking classes
at miss McGiva's finishing school.

16:27.100 --> 16:31.000
And one night, Bobby Joe Springer
escorted me back

16:31.066 --> 16:33.233
after the annual
fine manners ball,

16:33.300 --> 16:35.066
when an innocent
good night kiss

16:35.133 --> 16:37.000
developed into
an evening of passion.

16:37.066 --> 16:39.834
But at 3 am,
the door flung open,

16:39.900 --> 16:41.700
and there stood miss McGiva,

16:41.767 --> 16:45.000
making one of her
famous bed checks.

16:45.066 --> 16:48.000
I tried to handle it like a lady.

16:48.066 --> 16:52.533
I waved politely over Bobby Joe's
shoulder with my foot.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.000
She was unmoved.

17:03.066 --> 17:06.100
Next day, she sat me down,
lectured me,

17:06.166 --> 17:07.567
and kicked me out of school.

17:08.066 --> 17:11.967
Only I didn't care.
I knew what ecstasy was.

17:12.467 --> 17:15.300
All she could do was walk around
with a dictionary on her head.

17:17.133 --> 17:20.133
Maybe you won't talk
to me or each other,

17:20.200 --> 17:21.967
but talk to your children.

17:22.033 --> 17:23.800
Tell them your feelings.

17:23.867 --> 17:26.066
Just make sure after it's all over

17:26.133 --> 17:28.967
that it's brought you closer
together, not further apart.

17:29.033 --> 17:31.533
Who are you, Mr. Spock?

17:32.800 --> 17:35.266
I think you mean Dr. Spock, Sophia.

17:35.333 --> 17:37.467
They're both real smart
and have big ears,

17:37.533 --> 17:39.333
so don't get technical, ok?

17:40.533 --> 17:43.767
I am speaking from experience.

17:43.834 --> 17:46.266
I failed to listen to my children.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.800
You don't see them visiting, do you?

17:48.867 --> 17:51.233
I don't see my hand
in front of my face.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.233
Blanche,
you're making a lot of sense.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.934
We were so busy
protecting our kids,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.734
we took it out on each other.

18:00.233 --> 18:02.834
-I think I owe you an apology.
-I owe you one.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.900
-No, I owe you.
-Girls, what's the difference?

18:05.967 --> 18:08.767
What's important is
we're friends again.

18:08.834 --> 18:12.967
Maybe you're friends again,
but I don't forgive or forget,

18:13.033 --> 18:14.266
and I'm prone to growing moles.

18:14.333 --> 18:15.834
I can't help it. I'm Italian.

18:25.066 --> 18:26.433
Please, go on.

18:27.867 --> 18:29.333
That's enough.

18:30.834 --> 18:33.333
I want to talk to you
about last night.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.300
Sure, mom.

18:34.367 --> 18:37.667
You ungrateful brat.
How could you do this to me?

18:37.734 --> 18:40.934
I'm sorry. That's not
what I planned on saying.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.700
You have every right
to be angry.

18:43.767 --> 18:46.934
How could you do such a thing?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.100
It wasn't anything planned.

18:49.166 --> 18:50.734
It just happened.

18:50.800 --> 18:51.867
Just happened?

18:51.934 --> 18:56.033
Dandruff just happens,
not a thing like this.

18:56.100 --> 18:59.233
If you don't know the difference,
I must've failed somewhere.

18:59.300 --> 19:02.300
Stop torturing yourself.
This isn't your fault.

19:02.367 --> 19:04.734
Yes, it is.
Where did I go wrong?

19:04.800 --> 19:06.633
You didn't.
You're a great mother.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.100
If I were a great mother,

19:08.166 --> 19:10.266
you'd be graduating
from medical school,

19:10.333 --> 19:14.333
not playing doctor with my best
friend's daughter in this house.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.166
Mom, sorry.

19:17.233 --> 19:19.166
I know it wasn't
the right time or place,

19:19.233 --> 19:22.200
and it ended up embarrassing you,
grandma and your friends.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.567
I guess I wasn't thinking.

19:24.633 --> 19:28.367
That's your problem, Michael.
You go through life not thinking.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.767
You go from town to town,
job to job,

19:30.834 --> 19:33.300
obviously relationship
to relationship.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.800
Michael, you're 29 years old.

19:35.867 --> 19:39.233
When are you going to grow up and
accept some responsibility?

19:39.300 --> 19:41.734
I'm sorry about what happened.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.667
I'm sorry I'll never be
everything you hoped I'd be.

19:44.734 --> 19:48.033
All I want you to be is happy.

19:48.100 --> 19:52.533
I don't want you waking up one
morning sorry for choices you made.

19:53.033 --> 19:54.367
I appreciate that.

19:55.233 --> 19:56.200
But, Ma...

19:56.734 --> 19:58.533
I have to live my own life...

19:59.533 --> 20:01.300
and despite my flaws,

20:01.367 --> 20:05.133
I'm basically a decent,
honest person.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.000
You think maybe you could
just love me for that?

20:11.600 --> 20:12.900
I already do.

20:15.300 --> 20:16.500
Then you forgive me?

20:18.033 --> 20:20.600
Of course, I forgive you,

20:20.667 --> 20:23.367
but if you ever pull
a stunt like that again,

20:23.433 --> 20:25.700
I am going to throw you out
on your flawed

20:25.767 --> 20:27.767
but honest, decent behind.

20:29.567 --> 20:32.333
-So, did you two make up?
-Yes, Ma.

20:32.400 --> 20:35.066
Did you apologize to your mother
and beg her forgiveness?

20:35.133 --> 20:36.100
Yes, grandma.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.567
Ok, now do it to me.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.734
I'm sorry, Grandma.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.533
I wouldn't hurt you
for the world.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.767
-I hope you can forgive me.
-That's it?

20:48.734 --> 20:50.533
And I promise
to write you more often.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.433
-And?
-And call you every week.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.133
Every week? What, you think
I don't have a social life?

20:56.266 --> 20:58.333
You can call me
every other week.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.934
Ok, every other week.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.500
Good, you're forgiven.

21:03.133 --> 21:04.734
Oh, thank God
this mess is over.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.433
I couldn't see a thing
through this crap.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.166
Well, I'm all packed
and ready to go.

21:20.233 --> 21:22.066
I'll have your lunch done
in a minute.

21:22.633 --> 21:24.934
Mom, I think we should talk.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.834
Why don't we forget it?

21:26.900 --> 21:28.667
I don't want to.

21:28.734 --> 21:30.133
Then I forgive you.

21:30.200 --> 21:32.367
I know it wasn't your fault.

21:32.433 --> 21:36.967
Mom, you've got to stop pretending
I'm some kind of perfect angel.

21:37.033 --> 21:38.200
I'm not.

21:38.266 --> 21:42.734
I make mistakes, and what I did
the other night was one of them.

21:43.834 --> 21:48.066
And I am sorry about embarrassing
you and your friends,

21:48.133 --> 21:51.400
but that doesn't change the fact
that I slept with Michael.

21:52.467 --> 21:56.767
Honey, I so wanted your first time
to be special.

21:59.400 --> 22:02.967
It was, mom...
four years ago.

22:07.233 --> 22:09.033
I really don't want
to talk about this.

22:10.734 --> 22:13.133
I want us to talk about this.

22:13.200 --> 22:16.667
I want us to have an open,
honest relationship.

22:16.734 --> 22:20.734
I want to be able to share my
deepest, darkest secrets with you.

22:21.233 --> 22:23.533
Couldn't we just
wear matching outfits?

22:28.533 --> 22:29.633
Mother.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.133
I'm sorry, honey.

22:31.200 --> 22:35.767
It's just that suddenly, it's like
you're a whole new person.

22:36.667 --> 22:38.734
It's going to take a little
getting used to.

22:40.300 --> 22:41.967
I understand.

22:43.166 --> 22:45.433
Oh, I'm going to miss you
very much.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.033
I'm going to miss you too.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.767
You're sure I can't drive you
to the airport?

22:50.834 --> 22:52.800
No. I'll be fine.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.767
Dorothy, Sophia,
thank you for having me.

22:59.834 --> 23:01.967
Don't thank me,
thank my grandson.

23:08.033 --> 23:09.700
Mom, got to go.

23:09.767 --> 23:13.200
I thought you were staying
for the week.

23:13.266 --> 23:16.767
I got a gig in new Orleans,
and I don't need a tie.

23:17.266 --> 23:20.600
Good luck.
Call me when you get there.

23:20.667 --> 23:21.567
I will.

23:22.433 --> 23:23.500
Bye-bye, grandma.

23:24.233 --> 23:25.433
Be good, Michael.

23:26.734 --> 23:27.767
Rose.

23:27.834 --> 23:30.367
-Want to share a taxi?
-Sounds great.

23:30.433 --> 23:32.600
Make sure that's all you share.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.333
You two have a safe trip.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.433
Bye-bye, mom.

23:39.233 --> 23:41.233
Girls, how do I look?

23:42.633 --> 23:43.900
Where are you going?

23:43.967 --> 23:45.000
I have a date.

23:45.066 --> 23:47.100
The doctor said to take it easy.

23:47.166 --> 23:50.467
I'm going stir crazy.
I have to get out.

23:51.433 --> 23:53.934
Blanche,
stick to the doctor's orders.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.266
Dorothy's right.

23:55.333 --> 23:58.033
Nonsense. Who knows
my body better than I do?

23:58.100 --> 24:01.934
Any man in Miami not attached
to a woman or a respirator.

24:06.033 --> 24:07.333
Ha-ha-ha.

24:13.700 --> 24:18.567
