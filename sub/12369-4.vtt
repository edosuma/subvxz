WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.461
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.545 --> 00:07.048
IN FRONT OF
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:07.132 --> 00:12.053
- OH, THERE YOU ARE, ELKA.
I BROUGHT THE LOOT.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.431
- WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS,
MAMIE SUE.

00:14.514 --> 00:17.934
"LOOT" MAKES IT SOUND LIKE
WE'RE PIRATES.

00:18.017 --> 00:22.397
- I'M SORRY.
I GOT THE BENJAMINS.

00:22.480 --> 00:25.150
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE BENJAMINS.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.614
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH ALL THAT MONEY?

00:31.698 --> 00:33.950
- WHAT MONEY?

00:34.033 --> 00:36.786
- ELKA, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

00:36.870 --> 00:42.250
- WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW,
WE'VE STARTED A BUSINESS.

00:42.333 --> 00:45.962
IT'S A DATING SERVICE
FOR SENIORS. RIGHT?

00:46.045 --> 00:50.425
- SURE. IT'S CALLED
CLEVELAND...GILFs.

00:53.428 --> 00:59.267
- UH...GRANDMOTHERS
I'D LIKE TO FRIEND.

00:59.350 --> 01:02.812
- SO THAT'S WHAT ALL
THE SECRECY HAS BEEN ABOUT?

01:02.896 --> 01:04.647
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE BACK IN SCHOOL
GETTING A BUSINESS DEGREE?

01:04.730 --> 01:06.483
- YEP, THAT'S WHY.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.527
- THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.822
- IT IS A GOOD IDEA.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.326
- AND A GREAT COVER
FOR OUR <i> REAL</i> BUSINESS.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.078
- AND MAYBE I COULD USE IT
TO MEET SOMEONE.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.539
AND THEN I COULD DOUBLE DATE
WITH YOU AND PIERRE.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.501
- OH, I'D BE NERVOUS
BRINGING ANOTHER GUY

01:24.584 --> 01:28.463
ON A DATE WITH PIERRE.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.048
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
WE MIGHT END UP

01:30.131 --> 01:35.136
BOTH GOING HOME ALONE.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.349
- OH, HONEY,
WERE YOU UP ALL NIGHT?

01:39.432 --> 01:41.851
- HOW COULD I SLEEP?
I'M LOSING MY MIND.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.395
- OKAY, WORST-CASE SCENARIO:

01:44.479 --> 01:46.815
YOUR BOSS OVERHEARD YOU SAY
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HIM.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.358
NOW HE'S ON VACATION
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND,

01:48.441 --> 01:50.527
LAUGHING ABOUT IT.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.362
AND WHEN CHLOE,
HIS EX-WIFE--

01:52.445 --> 01:54.280
ALSO YOUR BOSS--
FINDS OUT,

01:54.364 --> 01:57.325
YOU'LL BE HUMILIATED,
ALONE, AND FIRED.

01:57.408 --> 01:58.993
- [forced laugh]

01:59.077 --> 02:01.746
OH, GOD, IF I WASN'T CATHOLIC
AND DIDN'T HAVE TWO KIDS

02:01.830 --> 02:03.081
AND I DIDN'T HAVE
A DENTIST APPOINTMENT TOMORROW

02:03.164 --> 02:04.374
THAT WOULD BE SO RUDE
TO CANCEL THIS LATE,

02:04.457 --> 02:07.418
I'D KILL MYSELF.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.003
I KNOW,
I'LL SEND HIM A TEXT

02:10.088 --> 02:11.047
AND TELL HIM
IT WAS ALL A JOKE.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.924
- OH, I DON'T KNOW, MELANIE.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.259
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS GOOD, THIS IS GOOD.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.386
I'LL SAY IT WAS
AN ELABORATE PRANK.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.055
I PUNKED HIM. AND SEND.
THAT'LL FIX IT.

02:19.138 --> 02:20.807
NO, IT WON'T.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.725
WHY WOULD I PULL
SUCH AN ELABORATE PRANK?

02:22.809 --> 02:24.894
AND HOW COULD I KNOW
THAT HE'D OVERHEAR ME?

02:24.978 --> 02:30.233
AND WHY DID AUTOCORRECT
CHANGE "PUNKED" TO "PUKED"?

02:30.316 --> 02:33.611
AND NOW ALEC
AND HIS GIRLFRIEND CARMEN

02:33.695 --> 02:34.863
HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
TO LAUGH ABOUT

02:34.946 --> 02:36.406
IN BETWEEN BOUTS
OF LOVEMAKING.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.617
I COULD JUST SEE IT NOW...
HER ON TOP OF HIM...

02:39.701 --> 02:42.579
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
SHE'S ON TOP?

02:42.662 --> 02:44.581
- IT'S EARLY IN THE DAY.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.959
SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO MESS UP HER HAIR.

02:48.042 --> 02:50.044
OKAY, SO WHAT SHOULD I DO?

02:50.128 --> 02:51.754
- CALL VICTORIA.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.590
SHE'S ALWAYS GOOD
FOR AN ASININE SCHEME.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.884
- NO, NO, I DON'T WANT
TO BUG VICTORIA.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.260
IT'S HER FIRST DAY
OF REHEARSAL.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.928
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SURE SHE'S BUSY

02:59.012 --> 03:01.598
DOING SOMETHING ASININE
ALREADY.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.309
- AN EXCELLENT QUESTION,
BARBARA.

03:04.392 --> 03:07.061
HOW DO I FEEL BEING
IN MY FIRST WOODY ALLEN MOVIE,

03:07.145 --> 03:09.439
STARRING OPPOSITE
SIR EMMET LAWSON?

03:09.522 --> 03:12.150
HOW <i> DON'T</i> I FEEL?

03:12.233 --> 03:13.526
[knock on door]

03:13.610 --> 03:14.277
- VICTORIA, ARE YOU IN THERE?

03:14.360 --> 03:17.614
- OH, UH, YES, EMMET.
COME IN.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.659
- TERRIFIC JOB THIS MORNING,
MY LOVE. BRAVA!

03:21.743 --> 03:23.411
- OH, YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

03:23.494 --> 03:25.121
- YOU ARE THE REAL DEAL,
KID.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.248
- OH, COMING FROM YOU,
THAT MEANS SO MUCH.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.958
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE.
- [chuckles]

03:29.042 --> 03:31.336
I'VE ALSO GOT SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.837
[cell phones buzz]
- OH...

03:32.921 --> 03:35.632
- EXCUSE ME.
JUST MY GOOGLE ALERT.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.426
- YEAH, MINE TOO.
OH, MY GOD.

03:38.509 --> 03:41.930
TMZ IS REPORTING THAT
WE ARE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.973
- THAT'S WHAT I CAME
TO TELL YOU.

03:54.233 --> 03:57.153
- YES! OH, OH!

03:57.236 --> 03:59.113
[mimicking passionate moans]

03:59.197 --> 04:01.824
YES! DON'T STOP!

04:01.908 --> 04:03.993
{\an8}HEY, YOU THINK
'THEY'RE BUYING IT OUT THERE?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.787
{\an8}- OH, TRUST ME.
HALF THE CREW IS

04:05.870 --> 04:08.331
{\an8}ON THE PHONE
TO TMZ ALREADY.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.999
{\an8}NOTHING LIKE A BIT
OF JUICY GOSSIP

04:10.083 --> 04:11.668
{\an8}TO KEEP YOUR NAME
IN THE PAPERS

04:11.751 --> 04:13.670
{\an8}AND GET YOUR MOVIE
TRENDING.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.838
{\an8}- I'M GETTING
A LITTLE NAUSEOUS.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.675
{\an8}HOW MUCH LONGER DO
WE HAVE TO KEEP DOING THIS?

04:18.757 --> 04:19.716
{\an8}- IT'S ONLY BEEN
THREE MINUTES.

04:19.801 --> 04:20.843
{\an8}I HAVE MY REPUTATION
TO THINK OF.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.470
{\an8}- OH.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.973
{\an8}YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT THIS
WHOLE FAKE RELATIONSHIP THING.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.350
{\an8}DO YOU DO THIS REGULARLY?
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.686
{\an8}I ONCE CARRIED ON
A SIX-MONTH ROMANCE

04:29.769 --> 04:30.853
{\an8}WITH HELENA BONHAM CARTER.
- OH.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.064
{\an8}- NEVER MET HER.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.692
{\an8}BIG FINISH?
- PLEASE.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.486
{\an8}[both moaning]

04:38.569 --> 04:41.990
{\an8}OH, GOD! OH, GOD! OH, GOD!

04:42.073 --> 04:45.159
{\an8}[both cry out in unison]

04:45.243 --> 04:47.704
{\an8}- AND...SCENE.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.083
{\an8}- OH, IT'S JUST SO FLATTERING.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.211
{\an8}AN ACTOR OF EMMET'S CALIBER
CAN HAVE HIS PICK OF ACTRESSES

04:55.294 --> 04:57.505
{\an8}TO HAVE
A FAKE ROMANCE WITH.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.549
{\an8}- ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE REALLY FAKING IT,

04:59.632 --> 05:01.759
{\an8}NOT FAKING FAKING IT?

05:01.843 --> 05:04.012
{\an8}BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU GENUINELY LIKE HIM.

05:04.095 --> 05:08.057
{\an8}- NO, NO, NO, NO,
MY FAKERY IS SINCERE.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.727
{\an8}- WELL, AT LEAST YOU KNOW
EMMET FAKE-LOVES YOU.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.021
{\an8}I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW ALEC FEELS ABOUT ME.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.023
{\an8}AND I CAN'T CHECK MY PHONE
BECAUSE JOY TOOK IT.

05:15.106 --> 05:19.569
{\an8}- FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS
TEXT STUPID.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.696
{\an8}- OH, YOU TEXTED HIM?

05:21.779 --> 05:23.239
{\an8}- JUST A FEW TIMES.

05:23.322 --> 05:26.284
{\an8}- EIGHT TIMES!
I TRIED TO STOP HER.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.244
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.
ALL YOU SAID WAS,

05:28.327 --> 05:30.705
[imitating Joy]
"OH, I DON'T KNOW, MELANIE."

05:35.334 --> 05:37.420
ANYWAY, HE DIDN'T WRITE BACK,
AND I COULDN'T STAND IT,

05:37.503 --> 05:40.590
SO THEN I TEXTED--
- "SORRY I TEXTED BEFORE.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.468
SHOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED YOU
ON VACAY."

05:43.551 --> 05:45.595
- I WAS SURE
HE'D ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.765
- BUT HE DIDN'T, SO...
"HI AGAIN.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.975
"I KNOW I SAID I SHOULDN'T
HAVE TEXTED BEFORE,

05:51.059 --> 05:52.602
"BUT COULD YOU JUST
TEXT BACK 'K'

05:52.685 --> 05:54.896
SO I KNOW YOU'RE SAFE?"

05:54.979 --> 05:57.106
- AND?
- NOTHING.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.233
SO TO CALM DOWN,
I HAD A LITTLE WINE.

05:59.317 --> 06:03.654
- WHICH BRINGS US TO...
"HEY, NUMBNUTS, WHAT GIVES?"

06:06.032 --> 06:08.910
- EXCUSE ME, JOY,
ELKA AND I NEED HELP

06:08.993 --> 06:10.495
OPENING A BOTTLE.

06:10.578 --> 06:13.456
MAY WE PLEASE BORROW
YOUR BIG MAN HANDS?

06:20.213 --> 06:23.925
- GOOD LORD, IT'S
1,000 DEGREES IN HERE.

06:24.008 --> 06:27.637
- [whispers loudly]
MENOPAUSE.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.807
- OH, WOULD YOU MIND
LOOKING OVER THIS AD I WROTE

06:30.890 --> 06:32.600
FOR CLEVELAND GILFs?

06:32.683 --> 06:34.519
ELKA DOESN'T THINK
IT'S SEXY ENOUGH.

06:34.602 --> 06:38.022
- IF THIS IS SEXY,
I'M RIHANNA.

06:38.106 --> 06:42.193
- THERE YOU GO
MAKING UP WORDS AGAIN.

06:42.276 --> 06:45.446
I KNOW, JOY CAN
READ IT OUT LOUD

06:45.530 --> 06:46.697
AND THEN WE'LL DECIDE.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.158
- NO, NOT JOY.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.577
BRITISH VOICES
ARE NOT SEXY.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.871
- OH, REALLY?

06:53.955 --> 06:55.665
WELL, I'LL JUST GET
MY READING GLASSES

06:55.748 --> 06:58.209
AND WE'LL SEE
WHO'S SEXY.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.837
- IF ELKA HOLDS THE PAGES
FAR ENOUGH AWAY,

07:00.920 --> 07:02.296
YOU WON'T NEED GLASSES.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.632
- ALL RIGHT.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.509
GOD, IT'S HOT IN HERE.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.344
- WELL, TAKE OFF
YOUR SWEATER.

07:08.427 --> 07:12.181
- AND I'LL POINT THE FAN
AT YOU.

07:14.433 --> 07:17.270
- HI THERE.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.856
ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR SOME INAPPROPRIATE FUN

07:19.939 --> 07:23.526
WITH SOME AGE-APPROPRIATE
WOMEN?

07:23.609 --> 07:24.235

07:26.445 --> 07:28.823
AH, IT'S FROM CHLOE.

07:28.906 --> 07:31.159
OH, SHE CAN'T
REACH ALEC EITHER.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.870
SHE'S TEXTED HIM TEN TIMES.
- TEN TIMES?

07:33.953 --> 07:37.123
WOW.
TALK ABOUT NEEDY.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.542
- [gasps]
OH, AND SHE SAW ON PEREZHILTON

07:39.625 --> 07:43.212
THAT EMMET AND I ARE HAVING
A STEAMY, ON-SET AFFAIR.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.089
OH, AND APPARENTLY
WE'RE THINK ABOUT

07:45.173 --> 07:48.676
ADOPTING A BABY
FROM MALAWI.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.553
WE ARE SUCH GIVERS.

07:52.680 --> 07:58.060

07:58.144 --> 08:00.188
ENJOY SHORT WALKS
ON THE BEACH

08:00.271 --> 08:03.024

08:10.573 --> 08:12.575
- SEE? HOT.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.826
- I WAS WRONG.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.412
I GUESS THERE'S NO FOOL
LIKE AN OLD FOOL.

08:16.495 --> 08:19.248
- THANK YOU.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.752
- SO DID WE GET
THE OLD FOOL ON TAPE?

08:22.835 --> 08:27.048

08:39.809 --> 08:41.562
BY EVERY GEEZER IN TOWN.

08:41.645 --> 08:44.148
- WIN-WIN.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.074
- HOW WAS SCHOOL?
- HOW OLD DO I LOOK?

08:53.157 --> 08:56.118
- 35. SAME AS ME. WHY?

08:56.202 --> 09:01.249
- ALL THESE OLD MEN KEEP
LEERING AND WAVING AT ME.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.418
AND CALLING ME A "TOMATO."

09:04.502 --> 09:05.962
THEY FOLLOWED ME
AROUND THE MALL

09:06.045 --> 09:10.258
LIKE A PACK
OF SLOW-MOVING ZOMBIES.

09:10.341 --> 09:14.971
LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO CLIMB
A FEW STAIRS AND LOSE THEM.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.306
- [gasps]
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS GREAT.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.933
ALEC JUST POSTED

09:19.016 --> 09:20.476
"SORRY I'M NOT RETURNING
MESSAGES,

09:20.559 --> 09:22.853
BUT I'M ON VACATION
AND I LEFT MY PHONE AT HOME."

09:22.937 --> 09:24.480
HE HASN'T SEEN MY TEXTS.

09:24.563 --> 09:25.982
HE DOESN'T THINK
I'M AN IDIOT.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.942
- I HATE TO BRING UP
THE OBVIOUS,

09:28.025 --> 09:30.486
BUT HE WILL SEE THEM
WHEN HE GETS BACK.

09:30.569 --> 09:33.197
AND BEFORE YOU ASK,
I WILL NOT HELP YOU

09:33.281 --> 09:36.158
BREAK INTO HIS APARTMENT
SO YOU CAN DELETE YOUR MESSAGES.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.829
- THAT IS A GREAT IDEA!

09:39.912 --> 09:43.666
YOU KNOW, BETWEEN THIS
AND THE STAIR TRICK,

09:43.749 --> 09:46.002
YOU'RE KIND OF A GENIUS.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.755

TO SAY FOR YOURSELVES?

10:17.825 --> 10:20.036
- I'M SO SORRY.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.039
- WE NEVER MEANT
FOR YOU TO FIND OUT.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.335
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DATE
ANYONE.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.379
YOU'RE JUST THERE TO GET
THE RUBES IN THE TENT.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.924
- IT'S A CLASSIC
BAIT AND SWITCH.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.594
WE WERE JUST SAYING
HOW SMART WE WERE TO GO WITH YOU

10:36.677 --> 10:38.846
INSTEAD OF VICTORIA
OR MELANIE.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.515
- WELL, THAT'S NICE.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.601
- HELLO, EVERYONE.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.519
- WOW!

10:45.603 --> 10:49.231
WE SHOULD HAVE GONE
WITH VICTORIA.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.233
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ALL DOLLED UP?

10:51.317 --> 10:53.194
- I HAVE A DATE.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.279
MY FAKE LOVER IS TAKING ME
TO A REAL DINNER.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.031
- EMMET LAWSON IS
COMING HERE?

10:57.114 --> 11:00.159
- MM-HMM.
[doorbell rings]

11:02.745 --> 11:05.956
- VICTORIA,
YOU LOOK GLORIOUS!

11:06.040 --> 11:09.001
AND, MELANIE,
YOU'RE A VISION.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.504
- OH, AND THIS IS JOY.
- HI.

11:11.587 --> 11:14.298
- HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU
YOU LOOK LIKE KATE BECKINSALE?

11:14.382 --> 11:18.594
- YES!

11:18.677 --> 11:20.221
- [clears throat]

11:20.304 --> 11:22.598
- OH, AND THIS IS ELKA
AND MAMIE SUE.

11:22.681 --> 11:23.766
-<i> ENCHANTE.</i>

11:23.849 --> 11:26.769
- OH, SAY,
"BY ODIN'S SWORD,

11:26.852 --> 11:29.772
I WILL MAKE THE EARTH TREMBLE
WITH MY FORCE."

11:29.855 --> 11:32.024
- FROM A LITTLE FILM CALLED
<i>WARS OF ASGARD.</i>

11:32.108 --> 11:32.983
- YES.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.277
- "BY ODIN'S SWORD,

11:35.361 --> 11:37.571
I WILL MAKE THE EARTH TREMBLE
WITH MY FORCE."

11:37.655 --> 11:39.782
[rapid applause]

11:39.865 --> 11:42.618
- NOW SAY "LOVE DIES..."

11:42.701 --> 11:43.994
- "BUT ITS ECHOES NEVER DO."

11:44.078 --> 11:46.956
FROM THE FILM
<i>A HYMN AT EVENSONG.</i>

11:47.039 --> 11:49.458
A FAVORITE.
[applause]

11:49.542 --> 11:52.461
- NOW SAY,
"I DON'T CARE WHO'S WATCHING,

11:52.545 --> 11:56.924
I WANT TO TAKE YOU
RIGHT NOW."

12:01.554 --> 12:03.639
- WHAT FILM IS THAT FROM?
I DON'T RECALL IT.

12:03.722 --> 12:08.894
- JUST SAY IT.

12:08.978 --> 12:12.606
- OKAY, I THINK MAYBE
IT'S TIME FOR US TO LEAVE.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.984
- ACTUALLY, THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

12:15.067 --> 12:18.112
[both cell phones chime]
- OH...

12:18.195 --> 12:21.323
OH, ANOTHER GOOGLE ALERT.
WHAT HAVE WE DONE NOW?

12:21.407 --> 12:23.117
[gasps]

12:23.200 --> 12:25.494
WE'VE BROKEN UP?

12:25.578 --> 12:28.539
- I'M SO SORRY, VICTORIA.
TRULY.

12:28.622 --> 12:31.125
BUT MY AGENT SAID THAT
YOU WEREN'T TESTING VERY WELL.

12:31.208 --> 12:35.796
SO NOW I'M HAVING A FAKE AFFAIR
WITH HEIDI KLUM...

12:35.880 --> 12:36.839
WHOM, I'M TOLD,
IS VERY NICE.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.800
- SHE IS BARELY
IN THE MOVIE.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.844
- YES, IT'S A ROTTEN BUSINESS.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.846
BUT WE STILL HAVE
OUR <i> REAL</i> FRIENDSHIP.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.182
- WHY COULDN'T I HAVE
DUMPED YOU?

12:46.265 --> 12:47.516
- YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT
THE WAY IT IS.

12:47.600 --> 12:52.354
I'M A BIGGER STAR.
[all gasp and groan]

12:52.438 --> 12:54.190
- JUST GO.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.692
- LOOK, THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

12:56.775 --> 12:57.568
YOU'RE MORE THAN
FAKE HURT, AREN'T YOU?

12:57.651 --> 12:59.320
- GET OUT.

12:59.403 --> 13:03.365
- AS YOU WISH.
GOOD NIGHT.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.870
- OH, HONEY,
ARE YOU OKAY?

13:07.953 --> 13:10.039
- [shaky]
NO.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.041
- YOU DO HAVE REAL FEELINGS
FOR HIM, DON'T YOU?

13:12.124 --> 13:14.710
- OF COURSE NOT.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.504
I WOULDN'T MAKE
THE ROOKIE MISTAKE

13:16.587 --> 13:19.715
OF FALLING FOR MY CO-STAR,
NO MATTER HOW HANDSOME

13:19.798 --> 13:23.052
AND CHARMING
AND RIGHT HE IS FOR ME

13:23.135 --> 13:25.846
IN HUNDREDS OF WAYS.

13:25.930 --> 13:31.185
I'M JUST ANGRY BECAUSE
HE CARES SO LITTLE FOR ME

13:31.268 --> 13:33.437
THAT HE CAN JUST SWITCH
FAKE RELATIONSHIPS

13:33.521 --> 13:36.065
WITHOUT ANY REGARD
FOR MY FEELINGS.

13:36.148 --> 13:39.360
- IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

13:39.443 --> 13:42.905
HEIDI KLUM'S NOT GOING
TO STAY WITH HIM.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.074
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

13:45.157 --> 13:46.617
- SHE WAS MARRIED TO SEAL.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.370
AND...HOW TO PUT THIS?

13:49.453 --> 13:52.373
ONCE YOU'VE HAD
CARNAL RELATIONS

13:52.456 --> 13:56.585
WITH A GENTLEMAN
OF AFRICAN DESCENT...

13:56.669 --> 13:59.171
IT'S QUITE UNUSUAL
TO GO BACK.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.019
- HURRY UP BEFORE
ALEC'S NEIGHBORS SEE US.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.771
- DON'T WORRY,
I GOT THIS.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.064
- WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO PICK A LOCK?

14:17.147 --> 14:18.899
- A LIFETIME ORIGINAL MOVIE,

14:18.983 --> 14:20.776
<i>DON'T GO BREAKING INTO</i>
<i>MY HEART.</i>

14:20.859 --> 14:23.487
[cell phone chimes]

14:23.571 --> 14:25.155
- OH, VICTORIA,
YOU GOT A GOOGLE ALERT.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.865
- WHAT'S IT SAY?

14:26.949 --> 14:29.076
- NOTHING.

14:29.159 --> 14:31.078
- IT'S ABOUT EMMET, ISN'T IT?
JUST READ IT.

14:31.161 --> 14:32.413
- OKAY.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.957
"EMMET LAWSON
LINKED WITH HEIDI KLUM,

14:35.040 --> 14:37.459
TELLS VICTORIA CHASE
'YOU'RE OUT.'"

14:37.543 --> 14:39.295
- OH.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.838
- I'M SORRY, SWEETIE.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.757
- YEAH, WELL, HE'S THE ONE
WHO'S GONNA BE SORRY.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.343
EMMET AND I ARE DOING
OUR BEHIND-THE-SCENES INTERVIEW

14:46.427 --> 14:47.970
FOR THE DVD TOMORROW,

14:48.053 --> 14:51.765
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT I'M GOING
TO BE ABLE TO STAY CIVIL.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.144
SPOILER ALERT, I'M NOT.

14:55.227 --> 15:00.691
AND PRESTO.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.276
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:02.359 --> 15:05.321
IT WORKED EVERY TIME
ON THE MOVIE.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.824
- EXCUSE ME.

15:08.907 --> 15:12.161
I JUST GOT A CALL
THAT THREE WOMEN

15:12.244 --> 15:14.997
WERE BREAKING INTO
AN APARTMENT.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.957
- YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.627
- YOU DON'T.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.837
BUT YOU DO.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.006
- I'M GUESSING YOU HAVE
A COMPUTER.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.801
- THAT'S IT! YOU'RE FROM
CLEVELANDGILFS.COM.

15:27.885 --> 15:32.723
- YES, I'M THEIR SPOKESGILF.

15:32.806 --> 15:35.017
- HEY, IF YOU HELP US OUT,

15:35.100 --> 15:36.226
MAYBE YOU TWO CAN MAKE
A LOVE CONNECTION.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.686
- MELANIE!

15:37.770 --> 15:39.813
- SHE NEEDS TO GET IN THERE
AND LEAVE A NOTE

15:39.897 --> 15:40.898
TO BREAK UP
WITH HER BOYFRIEND,

15:40.981 --> 15:43.359
AND THEN SHE'LL BE FREE
TO DATE YOU.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.654
- FINE! ONE DINNER.

15:46.737 --> 15:47.863
I'LL PICK YOU UP AT 8:00.

15:47.946 --> 15:50.115
- P.M.?

15:53.619 --> 15:56.330
- [gasps]
FOUND IT! FOUND IT! HA!

15:56.413 --> 15:58.332
DELETE, DELETE...

15:58.415 --> 16:01.210
WOW, I AM NOT
A GOOD DRUNK SPELLER.

16:01.293 --> 16:05.005
SO LONG, NUMBNUTS.
OKAY, THAT'S DONE.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.382
SO I GUESS THE ONLY
LOGICAL THING

16:06.465 --> 16:08.217
IS FOR US TO GET OUT
OF HERE.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.845
[laughter]

16:11.929 --> 16:14.056
- WE CAN'T LEAVE A MAN'S
APARTMENT WITHOUT SNOOPING.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.557
- NO, IT'S PRACTICALLY
EXPECTED.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.226
- ALMOST WRONG NOT TO.

16:17.309 --> 16:20.979
- DIBS ON THE MEDICINE CABINET.
- OH, RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.775
- MM.

16:24.858 --> 16:27.236
- AHH!
- AAH!

16:27.319 --> 16:28.362
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

16:28.445 --> 16:29.780
- UH...UH...

16:29.863 --> 16:31.573
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T CARE.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.409
I WAS GONNA DUMP ALEC'S STUFF
AT THE FRONT DOOR,

16:33.492 --> 16:34.535
BUT IT WAS OPEN, SO...

16:34.618 --> 16:36.620
- WAIT, CARMEN--

16:36.704 --> 16:39.873
AND DON'T BOTHER YOURSELF
WITH HOW I KNOW YOUR NAME--

16:39.957 --> 16:43.752
UM, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
IN COZUMEL WITH ALEC?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.255
- HE CALLED ME AT THE LAST
MINUTE AND TOLD ME NOT TO COME.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.424
HE SAID HE NEEDED TIME
TO THINK.

16:48.507 --> 16:52.094
LOOK AT ME. WHAT IS THERE
TO THINK ABOUT?

16:52.177 --> 16:55.973
- OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS,
THIS IS GREAT.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.308
ALEC LEFT HIS GIRLFRIEND
AT HOME, POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF ME.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.394
THIS IS FANTASTIC NEWS!

17:00.477 --> 17:05.107
- EVEN BETTER NEWS IN HERE.
EXTRA-LARGE CONDOMS.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.942
NO, NEVER MIND.

17:07.025 --> 17:09.778
JUST AN EXTRA-LARGE <i> BOX</i>
OF CONDOMS.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.117
- VICTORIA,
I'LL START WITH YOU.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.746
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WORKING
WITH EMMET LAWSON?

17:18.829 --> 17:22.790
- HM.
HOW DON'T I FEEL?

17:22.875 --> 17:25.294
YOU KNOW, EMMET HAS
THAT RARE QUALITY IN AN ACTOR

17:25.377 --> 17:27.588
OF TOTAL AND COMPLETE
SELFISHNESS.

17:27.671 --> 17:30.090
THE MAN
IS A CONSUMMATE FRAUD...

17:30.174 --> 17:33.260
IN A GOOD WAY.

17:33.343 --> 17:35.804
- IT'S BEEN A TREAT,
WORKING WITH VICTORIA AS WELL.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.683
HER SENSITIVITY
BORDERS ON THE UNHINGED...

17:39.767 --> 17:41.935
ALSO IN A GOOD WAY.

17:42.019 --> 17:45.773
- YOU KNOW, IN ACTING,
YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE MOMENT.

17:45.856 --> 17:49.526
SEE? THAT'S WHAT
THE MOMENT CALLED FOR.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.111
- AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE

17:51.195 --> 17:54.782
OF THAT UNHINGED QUALITY
I MENTIONED EARLIER.

17:54.865 --> 17:57.326
- IN THE MOVIE, YOU PLAY EXES
WHO HATE EACH OTHER

17:57.409 --> 17:59.161
BUT FALL IN LOVE AGAIN.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.497
HOW, AS ACTORS, DO YOU MAKE
THIS TRANSITION BELIEVABLE?

18:01.580 --> 18:03.123
- YES, WELL,
WHERE THERE'S ANGER,

18:03.207 --> 18:04.625
THERE'S ALSO USUALLY
PASSION,

18:04.708 --> 18:05.959
AND YOU NEED TO
HAVE PASSION

18:06.043 --> 18:07.795
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING
WITH SUCH AN INFURIATING,

18:07.878 --> 18:11.507
ALBEIT BEAUTIFUL CHARACTER.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.509
- YOU THINK THAT I'M--
I MEAN,

18:13.592 --> 18:15.344
MY CHARACTER IS BEAUTIFUL?

18:15.427 --> 18:18.889
- OF COURSE.
IT ALMOST HURTS TO LOOK AT HER.

18:18.972 --> 18:21.683
- WELL, HOW CAN
THIS BEAUTIFUL CHARACTER

18:21.767 --> 18:23.727
NOT RESPOND
TO THE DASHING MAN,

18:23.811 --> 18:25.854
NO MATTER HOW BADLY
HE TREATED HER?

18:25.938 --> 18:27.272
- WELL, HE DIDN'T MEAN
TO TREAT HER BADLY.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.816
IN FACT, IT'S THE LAST THING
HE'D EVER WANT TO DO

18:28.899 --> 18:29.858
TO SOMEBODY HE CARES ABOUT.

18:29.942 --> 18:30.984
- WELL, IF HE CARED
ABOUT HER,

18:31.068 --> 18:32.361
THEN WHY
HASN'T HE TOLD HER?

18:32.444 --> 18:33.695
- PERHAPS
SHE DIDN'T INDICATE

18:33.779 --> 18:34.655
THAT SHE GENUINELY
CARES FOR HIM.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.741
- WELL, MAYBE I'M--
SHE'S OLD-FASHIONED

18:37.825 --> 18:39.409
AND BELIEVES THAT
IT'S THE MAN'S JOB

18:39.493 --> 18:40.702
TO INITIATE THE PURSUIT.

18:40.786 --> 18:41.870
- I'M GETTING
A LITTLE LOST HERE.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.747
- OH, SHUT UP.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.582
I WAS DEVASTATED
LAST NIGHT

18:45.666 --> 18:47.668
WHEN YOU WENT ON YOUR DATE
WITH HEIDI KLUM.

18:47.751 --> 18:52.881
- OH, VICTORIA,
I HATED DATING HEIDI KLUM.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.051
HEIDI KLUM AND I
ARE NO LONGER AN ITEM.

18:56.134 --> 18:57.719
- I'M NOT SURPRISED.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.347
HOW TO PUT THIS?
ONCE YOU GO BLACK--

19:00.430 --> 19:03.183
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO NOW.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.065
- SO, HERE WE ARE.

19:10.148 --> 19:12.526
- YES, HERE WE ARE.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.444
- THE PRELUDE TO A KISS.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.405
- YES, BUT--

19:16.488 --> 19:18.907
- AH, THE "YES, BUT."

19:18.991 --> 19:20.784
NATURAL CAUTION
FROM TWO PEOPLE

19:20.868 --> 19:23.245
WHO'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.205
CARDS ON THE TABLE.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.748
I'VE HAD NUMEROUS
FAILED RELATIONSHIPS

19:26.832 --> 19:28.000
AND BEEN MARRIED
FOUR TIMES.

19:28.083 --> 19:33.213
- I'VE BEEN MARRIED FIVE TIMES,
NOT THAT IT'S A COMPETITION.

19:33.297 --> 19:36.466
- ON THE ONE HAND, WE SHOULD
PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.552
ON THE OTHER HAND,

19:38.635 --> 19:42.556
I SENSE YOUR OTHER HAND
PROCEEDING WITH ABANDON.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.813
"BY ODIN'S SWORD,

19:49.897 --> 19:53.692
I WILL MAKE THE EARTH
TREMBLE WITH MY FORCE."

19:59.865 --> 20:02.451
- THANK YOU
FOR YOUR BUSINESS.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.746
- NOW, FOR AN EXTRA $50,
WE CAN UPGRADE YOU

20:05.829 --> 20:09.750
TO A MODEL
WITH BIGGER HEADLIGHTS.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.793
- MUST YOU?

20:11.877 --> 20:16.590
- THAT'S OKAY.
I LIKE 'EM SCRAWNY.

20:16.673 --> 20:17.549
- PLEASE BRING HER BACK

20:17.633 --> 20:22.471
IN AS CLOSE TO
ORIGINAL CONDITION AS POSSIBLE.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.598
- SHALL WE, M'LADY?

20:29.895 --> 20:34.024
- SHE'S GOING TO BE
A GOOD LITTLE EARNER.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.901
- OH, BOY.
