WEBVTT

00:05.625 --> 00:06.999
Have you considered
just once that Dad

00:07.000 --> 00:08.124
is not the bloke
you think he is?

00:08.125 --> 00:09.332
He's a selfish prick.

00:09.333 --> 00:10.541
They wanted us
out of the picture.

00:10.542 --> 00:11.624
Who wanted us out
of the picture?

00:11.625 --> 00:12.708
Albert, Lily.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.832
- Where's the gold?!
- It's in the wheelbarrow.

00:17.833 --> 00:19.249
Where's my gold, boy?

00:19.250 --> 00:20.417
Bob Fink's got it.

00:21.625 --> 00:22.791
Okay, Charlie.

00:22.792 --> 00:24.374
I want to see her.

00:24.375 --> 00:25.666
They were supposed to kill you

00:25.667 --> 00:28.957
in Vic Hill's lockup
15 years ago.

00:28.958 --> 00:30.541
You were in on that?

00:30.542 --> 00:33.292
We all have to go a little
off peace at times.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.749
Yes, sir.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.750
The truck is on its way.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:50.208 --> 00:52.457
Hello, hello,
my little Grim Reaper.

00:52.458 --> 00:54.207
You still trucking, baby?

00:54.208 --> 00:56.166
<i>How long until
your heavy-metal steed</i>

00:56.167 --> 00:57.999
<i>slams into my throbbing
mosh pit?</i>

00:58.000 --> 00:59.917
Should be clocked out by 2:00.

01:05.917 --> 01:07.625
Right, let's be having ya.

01:09.167 --> 01:11.042
No, you bloody well don't.

01:21.167 --> 01:23.417
We've rung the bell.

01:57.042 --> 02:00.208
I warned you, Bobby-Boy.
Now look at ya.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.583
Right ol' mess.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.249
Right, we got 30 hours
to the exchange.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.332
Got a safe house
on Rivington Street

02:08.333 --> 02:09.832
where we can stash it.

02:09.833 --> 02:12.166
No.

02:12.167 --> 02:13.666
Take it to Elm Lodge.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.166
Bit close to home, sir.

02:16.167 --> 02:18.832
I don't intend to let this
out of my sight, Dwyer.

02:18.833 --> 02:20.499
Call Peters.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.749
Have him meet us there
with the rest of the squad.

02:22.750 --> 02:25.082
Load the gold into the van.

02:25.083 --> 02:29.250
And if you ask Windrush nicely,
he might lend a hand.

02:32.875 --> 02:34.333
Well?

02:52.667 --> 02:55.000
Keys, keys, keys, keys, keys.

02:58.875 --> 03:00.375
God.

03:26.208 --> 03:28.874
Come on, let's go.
Come on, come on, boy.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.000
Come on. Good boy.

04:05.917 --> 04:07.707
Vic.

04:07.708 --> 04:09.249
Albert.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.000
Lotti.

04:12.042 --> 04:13.122
What the hell's going on?

04:14.917 --> 04:16.332
Vic?
Family meeting, everyone out.

04:16.333 --> 04:17.832
- Stay.
- Get out!

04:17.833 --> 04:19.166
Stay! They've been more family

04:19.166 --> 04:20.957
than you have
these past few years.

04:20.958 --> 04:22.832
All right, I'll tell you
what happened.

04:22.833 --> 04:26.582
Your son lost my gold
to Bob Fink, all of it!

04:26.583 --> 04:27.916
Your gold?

04:27.917 --> 04:29.166
You had it for all of
about an hour

04:29.167 --> 04:31.249
15 years ago
the night you lost it.

04:31.250 --> 04:32.791
- I was sold out.
- Yeah, by Bob Fink.

04:32.792 --> 04:34.332
How did we not see
that one coming?

04:34.333 --> 04:36.666
That was then and this is now,
and now it's you!

04:36.667 --> 04:39.207
You're the snake
in the grass, my own son.

04:39.208 --> 04:42.041
You lied to me! Both of ya!

04:42.042 --> 04:43.374
Your father and your husband.

04:43.375 --> 04:46.332
Father, that's debatable,
isn't it?

04:46.333 --> 04:48.457
I try my best for you, boy.

04:48.458 --> 04:50.499
Being a bank robber
and a responsible parent

04:50.500 --> 04:52.166
weren't exactly
compatible occupations.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.916
Who said you had to be
a bank robber?

04:53.917 --> 04:55.499
I wouldn't have cared if you
were a plumber or a pen pusher.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.374
I was not meant to stick
my head under a sink

04:59.375 --> 05:01.374
or rot behind a desk!

05:01.375 --> 05:03.999
And neither were you.
That is not the Hill way.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.582
Hill way? Do me a favor.

05:05.583 --> 05:07.916
We have been hanging on
by a thread

05:07.917 --> 05:08.999
as long as I can remember!

05:09.000 --> 05:11.999
That is enough, the pair of you!

05:12.000 --> 05:15.124
You are so blind.

05:15.125 --> 05:18.416
So desperate to dish out
the blame.

05:18.417 --> 05:20.374
You are both
as obsessed as each other,

05:20.375 --> 05:22.375
two peas from the same pod.

05:24.667 --> 05:27.374
Now, this bloody gold has taken

05:27.375 --> 05:29.542
its pound of flesh
from all of us.

05:31.417 --> 05:33.500
It's all of us, not just you.

05:35.375 --> 05:37.249
I'm glad it's gone.
Fink's welcome to it.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.832
It can bury him the same way
it's buried

05:38.833 --> 05:41.292
everybody else
who's had it in their hands.

05:45.833 --> 05:48.457
It's late. We're all exhausted.

05:48.458 --> 05:49.583
Get some sleep.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.958
Everybody stays here tonight.

06:10.917 --> 06:12.667
What do you want, Vic?

06:13.667 --> 06:15.083
My wife.

06:19.333 --> 06:21.957
Fifteen years a long time
for a stag

06:21.958 --> 06:23.874
to be estranged from his doe.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.707
The only loving embrace
you're gonna get tonight

06:25.708 --> 06:26.999
is from the cushion of the sofa.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.875
Well, I didn't mean it
like that, Lil.

06:30.583 --> 06:33.458
I just... wanted to talk.

06:36.167 --> 06:38.082
- Well?
- Would you have preferred it

06:38.083 --> 06:39.791
if I was a civilian, Lil,

06:39.792 --> 06:42.457
stuck behind a desk every day?

06:42.458 --> 06:44.457
Me wearing a tie.

06:44.458 --> 06:46.332
You packing me cheese
and chutney sandwiches

06:46.333 --> 06:49.499
every day for lunch,
would that have made you happy?

06:49.500 --> 06:51.499
I knew who you were
when we tied the knot

06:51.500 --> 06:54.499
and I signed up to it,
all of it.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.500
And God knows
I've always fancied you.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.916
Sometimes I wish I didn't.

06:59.917 --> 07:02.333
Would've made all these
past years a lot more bearable.

07:04.042 --> 07:07.167
It's not me that you need
to worry about, it's your son.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.666
He needs a father who loves him,

07:10.667 --> 07:14.249
who, more importantly,
trusts him.

07:14.250 --> 07:17.250
You know, he's grown up into
a smart young man, your Albert.

07:19.708 --> 07:21.833
I just hope you take the time
to get to know him.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.666
You used to be a bit of
a footballer back in the day.

07:34.667 --> 07:37.166
- You still play a bit?
- Why?

07:37.167 --> 07:38.916
You fancy a kick about,
Hate 'Em?

07:38.917 --> 07:41.541
You know, your old man used
to drive me mad in the nick.

07:41.542 --> 07:44.291
Spun me the same story
over and over again

07:44.292 --> 07:46.166
about how you scored
the winning goal

07:46.167 --> 07:48.374
on some poxy
little league cup final.

07:48.375 --> 07:50.166
I'm surprised he even
remembered that.

07:50.167 --> 07:52.167
I never heard the end of it.

07:54.417 --> 07:56.291
The score was 1-1.

07:56.292 --> 07:58.166
It was the 89th minute.

07:58.167 --> 08:00.666
My Albert through on goal.

08:00.667 --> 08:03.124
Legs pumping like a pair
of pistons.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.624
Two massive defenders

08:04.625 --> 08:06.999
descending down on him
from either side.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.666
He drops his shoulder.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.791
Shells the first one like
a monkey nut.

08:10.792 --> 08:13.082
Second one got twisted
like a pretzel.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.082
Then it was my boy.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.832
One on one with the keeper.

08:16.833 --> 08:19.082
The keeper's come out,
spread himself like an octopus,

08:19.083 --> 08:21.082
all arms and legs.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.916
My Albert stood his ground.

08:22.917 --> 08:24.832
Spun that kid like a tornado.

08:24.833 --> 08:26.624
Smashed the back of that net.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.875
Yes, get in there!

08:31.833 --> 08:34.042
You know, I thought
I was gonna miss that?

08:40.125 --> 08:41.457
Your dad didn't.

08:41.457 --> 08:43.832
He always knew
you was gonna score.

08:43.832 --> 08:46.375
Never doubted you for a minute.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.374
Anyway, look, I'm knackered.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.542
I'm gonna go
and get my head down.

08:54.917 --> 08:56.875
Good night, kid.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.042
Back of the net.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.833
Scoot.

09:25.292 --> 09:27.332
Wake me up in five.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.333
I need to go and find the guys.

10:56.583 --> 10:57.750
Charlie!

10:58.917 --> 11:00.332
- Charlie.
- Morning.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.667
Morning. Come in.
The gang's in there.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.499
Come here.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.666
Where have you been?

11:06.667 --> 11:08.999
Let me see.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.332
I was kidnapped.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.749
Handcuffed to a radiator.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.457
Beaten to a pulp,
stuck in a closet,

11:13.458 --> 11:15.041
then witness to a brutal murder.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.457
You, been hitting

11:16.458 --> 11:17.874
the old gin and mushrooms
again, mate?

11:17.875 --> 11:19.999
Those days are behind me,
Billy-Boy.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.416
I'm a new man.

11:21.417 --> 11:23.666
- Who's this?
- This is Scooter.

11:23.667 --> 11:27.082
I adopted him.

11:27.083 --> 11:29.666
God, what happened? Someone die?

11:29.667 --> 11:31.500
Yeah, actually,
quite a few people.

11:33.958 --> 11:35.667
We lost the gold, Charlie.

11:37.083 --> 11:38.791
Fink's got it. We're done.

11:38.792 --> 11:41.749
Yeah, well, actually,
Fink doesn't have it.

11:41.750 --> 11:42.999
He's dead.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.624
What do you mean... Fink's dead?

11:45.625 --> 11:48.249
Yeah, with Fink's brains
splattered across the rug,

11:48.250 --> 11:51.374
off skipped
Chief Superintendent Jones

11:51.375 --> 11:53.332
to Elm Lodge with our bounty.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.624
Do you know this Jones
character, Hate 'Em?

11:55.625 --> 11:56.874
Yeah, he was a bent copper

11:56.875 --> 11:58.957
on the beat
from back in the day.

11:58.958 --> 12:00.832
Must have bullied his way
up the ladder.

12:00.833 --> 12:03.666
And he said 30 hours
to this exchange, right?

12:03.667 --> 12:05.166
So he's gonna off-load the gold

12:05.167 --> 12:06.999
early tomorrow morning
to his client.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.457
So that gives us enough time
to track him down, right?

12:09.458 --> 12:12.624
We are not going through
all this again.

12:12.625 --> 12:16.249
We are not going after the gold.

12:16.250 --> 12:17.666
Now, I said it would kill Fink

12:17.667 --> 12:19.082
just like it's killed
everybody else.

12:19.083 --> 12:20.541
What more proof do you need?

12:20.542 --> 12:22.082
Yeah, I'm with Mum on this one.
Forget the gold.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.332
Let somebody else feel
the weight of it.

12:24.333 --> 12:25.832
We hit Jones
at this exchange instead.

12:25.833 --> 12:28.042
Let him do the work for us.
We go for money.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.666
I like where you're going
with this, son.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.249
We cut the middleman,
play the end game.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.166
What do you reckon, Lil?

12:37.167 --> 12:39.166
Decamp to the lockup?

12:39.167 --> 12:42.832
Plan it out properly,
just like old times?

12:42.833 --> 12:44.166
We pull this off, Mum,
and we're clear

12:44.167 --> 12:46.291
of all this shit.

12:46.292 --> 12:48.666
We make for the sun
like you and Dad always wanted.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.292
A new life away from all this.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.542
- Dad, you all right?
- Vic?

13:58.542 --> 13:59.666
Vic?

13:59.667 --> 14:01.166
<i>Don't shoot!</i>

14:01.167 --> 14:02.374
<i>Dirty son of a bitch!</i>

14:02.375 --> 14:03.832
Vic?

14:03.833 --> 14:06.666
Yeah, I'm all right.

14:06.667 --> 14:09.457
Time to lay
these ghosts to rest.

14:09.458 --> 14:11.083
Yeah.

14:24.292 --> 14:26.666
Girls?

14:26.667 --> 14:27.875
Follow me.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.833
All right, Vic,
where's the work tools?

14:45.458 --> 14:46.667
Ma'am.

14:48.333 --> 14:50.333
Do the honors, Hate 'Em.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.417
Be rude not to, Vic.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.250
Albert?

15:22.167 --> 15:23.457
Jesus, Dad,
I thought you was a bank robber,

15:23.458 --> 15:24.832
not an urban guerrilla.

15:24.833 --> 15:25.999
You know
I've always been a sucker

15:26.000 --> 15:27.499
for big-boys' toys, Albert.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.708
Hot potato!

15:49.125 --> 15:53.416
"Elm Lodge residence,
Chief Superintendent Jones."

15:53.417 --> 15:55.541
What you got?

15:55.542 --> 15:57.582
Maps. Aerial shots.

15:57.583 --> 16:00.582
Even some interior photos.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.582
We need plans
of the internal layout.

16:02.583 --> 16:03.832
Building specs.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.499
Looks like a modern house,

16:05.500 --> 16:08.291
so, architectural records
should be available, right?

16:08.292 --> 16:09.458
Let's find out.

16:29.667 --> 16:31.167
- You all right under there?
- Yeah.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.082
Here we go.

16:35.083 --> 16:36.499
Got it?

16:36.500 --> 16:37.917
- You got it?
- Yeah.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.249
Jesus.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.166
Now that is
some old-school shit.

16:43.167 --> 16:45.541
There is no school like
the old school, son.

16:45.542 --> 16:46.874
Ain't that the truth.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.499
Can someone let me out now,
please?

16:48.500 --> 16:51.167
Coming on out you come. Coming.

16:52.458 --> 16:53.625
Ooh.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.916
You all right?

16:56.917 --> 16:58.625
I ain't got time to bleed,
Hate 'em?

17:04.750 --> 17:07.708
Hello, old girl. Been a while.

17:09.125 --> 17:10.624
Jesus, shouldn't that thing
be in a museum?

17:10.625 --> 17:12.707
This thing's Old Gerty, son.

17:12.708 --> 17:15.332
Don't be fooled by her oil leaks
and rusty drawers.

17:15.333 --> 17:18.666
This darling has tapped
more conflabs than MI5.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.499
It's dead as a doornail, Vic.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.915
Lift her up, Norm.

17:24.916 --> 17:26.250
Let's have a look.

17:34.042 --> 17:35.833
I'll get this old bird
singing in no time.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.999
That's everything we got
on Elm Lodge.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.999
Blimey.
Honks a bit in here, Mr. Hill.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.457
Yeah, well, you'd be a bit musty

17:44.458 --> 17:46.207
if you've been banged up
for 15 years, Charlie.

17:46.208 --> 17:49.541
You think these Young Turks
are taking the mickey out of us?

17:49.542 --> 17:51.416
Would you like me to put them
in the Judas cradle, Victor?

17:51.417 --> 17:53.582
No, no, no, today we're all
love and light, Hate 'Em.

17:53.583 --> 17:55.124
No negative vibes?

17:55.125 --> 17:57.792
Right you are. Okay.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.291
Good old days, Lil?

18:01.292 --> 18:02.833
Less of the old.

18:05.917 --> 18:07.708
Name that heist.

18:10.167 --> 18:12.332
Bradox job, '88.

18:12.333 --> 18:15.332
Electronic goods warehouse.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.666
Down payment on our first flat.

18:17.667 --> 18:21.332
Yeah, carried you
over the threshold.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.832
Didn't put me down for a week.

18:23.833 --> 18:25.791
Wait.

18:25.792 --> 18:28.791
I still fancy you, sweetheart.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.791
More than ever.

18:30.792 --> 18:32.167
I know you do.

18:35.708 --> 18:37.332
Ho-ho!

18:37.333 --> 18:38.917
Thar she blows, Starbuck.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.000
Go on, turn it in.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.666
You're looking good, Charlie.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.707
Do I?

18:53.708 --> 18:58.332
Yeah, well, I... yeah.
Well, yes, I do.

18:58.333 --> 19:01.624
You know what?
I feel good, Chloe.

19:01.625 --> 19:02.958
Yeah.

19:04.250 --> 19:06.083
What we up against?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.374
How does all this work,
then, Norman?

19:12.375 --> 19:14.042
Nothing to it, son.

19:16.875 --> 19:18.957
<i>If that mutt goes anywhere
near my bacon sandwich,</i>

19:18.958 --> 19:20.958
I'll turn it into mufflers.

19:25.333 --> 19:26.707
What do you reckon, Dad?

19:26.708 --> 19:29.499
I reckon we lay bugs...

19:29.500 --> 19:31.916
here... here...

19:31.917 --> 19:33.499
and here.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.999
Give ourselves good coverage
to pick up Jones's comms

19:36.000 --> 19:38.999
on the time and place
of the gold exchange.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.499
Right. Picture time.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.666
We're gonna need passports.

19:43.667 --> 19:44.916
What look are we going
for, Mrs. H?

19:44.917 --> 19:46.457
Straight goer, Hate 'Em.

19:46.458 --> 19:47.916
Just keep your mouth shut
and you'll be fine.

19:47.917 --> 19:50.250
There you go. Just look straight
at the camera.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.041
Got it? Lovely.

19:54.042 --> 19:55.375
Next? Who's up next? Come on.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.832
- Go on, you get up.
- Yeah.

20:11.833 --> 20:14.333
Fine work here.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.207
Albert, do the honors.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.292
- Me?
- It's your plan, son.

20:34.542 --> 20:37.832
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, and Hate 'Em...

20:37.833 --> 20:39.707
I hope you're ready
for the main event.

20:39.708 --> 20:41.249
We got three phases.

20:41.250 --> 20:44.749
Phase one is intel,
phase two is the takedown,

20:44.750 --> 20:46.917
phase three is the getaway.

20:50.708 --> 20:53.582
Have a look around ya.

20:53.583 --> 20:54.999
Look at each other.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.874
Each and every one of you
has a skill set

20:56.875 --> 20:58.707
that is going to come in handy.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.791
Now, whatever role you play,

21:00.792 --> 21:02.166
we're all as equally
as important

21:02.167 --> 21:05.499
if we're gonna pull this off.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.333
We work together.
We work as a team, all of us.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.125
We work as a family.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.582
You'll set the pineapples off!

21:36.583 --> 21:37.917
Let's go to work.

22:05.417 --> 22:07.207
Vic?

22:07.208 --> 22:08.416
Albert?

22:08.417 --> 22:10.207
- Albert?
- What?

22:10.208 --> 22:13.541
I'm not sure how I feel about
being called a "tit," mate.

22:13.542 --> 22:16.582
Who was the one that wanted
a bird as a code name?

22:16.583 --> 22:18.499
You. All right?

22:18.500 --> 22:21.374
Now go on.
Get up in the nest, Blue Tit.

22:21.375 --> 22:22.999
Sort it out, Norman.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.625
Horrible you are. Horrible kid.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.499
What?

22:35.500 --> 22:37.583
You pulled the short straw.

22:39.583 --> 22:41.333
Don't get too comfy, boys.

22:42.875 --> 22:45.583
This lot attracts bad guys
like flies to shit.

22:51.917 --> 22:53.374
Look at you two,
Ronnie and Reggie.

22:53.375 --> 22:56.874
Yeah, which one am I?

22:56.875 --> 22:58.332
Ronnie or Reggie?

22:58.333 --> 23:01.249
You're Ronnie, of course,
Charlie.

23:01.250 --> 23:03.042
Here you go, boys. Get mic'd up.

23:04.833 --> 23:07.541
And you cannot break into
a house

23:07.542 --> 23:09.667
without these bad boys.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.333
There you go.

23:19.292 --> 23:23.208
Um, yeah, what exactly are
these, Mr. Hill?

23:25.375 --> 23:27.333
- They're creepers.
- They're creepers.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.833
Bill, get Hate 'Em up
on comms, will ya?

23:33.625 --> 23:35.416
Blue Tit, this is Night Thunder.

23:35.417 --> 23:37.416
And copy? Over.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.332
<i>- Night Thunder?
- Night Thunder?</i>

23:39.333 --> 23:41.374
Are you taking the piss?

23:41.375 --> 23:44.542
Well, that's rich coming
from a blue tit. Over.

23:46.292 --> 23:48.832
<i>Blue Tit, this is Butch Cassidy.</i>

23:48.833 --> 23:51.666
Yeah, course it fuckin' is.

23:51.667 --> 23:55.332
<i>Are you in the nest? Over.</i>

23:55.333 --> 23:56.957
Give me a minute, will you...

23:56.958 --> 23:58.292
Butch?

24:06.833 --> 24:08.874
How much longer are these
bloody Corsicans

24:08.875 --> 24:11.499
gonna keep me waiting
on this exchange point?

24:11.500 --> 24:15.125
They're most likely navigating
their way into the docks... sir.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.083
The question is,
which docks, Dwyer?

24:27.833 --> 24:31.833
And is this
to your liking... sir?

24:34.667 --> 24:35.750
Yes.

24:42.167 --> 24:44.000
Thank you, Dwyer.

24:49.167 --> 24:51.499
Into position then, lads.
Keep 'em peeled.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.542
Roger that, Sundance.

25:04.167 --> 25:07.457
Here'll be fine.
Here'll be fine.

25:07.458 --> 25:11.332
Blue Tit is in the nest.

25:11.333 --> 25:14.832
What's the scores on the doors,
Blue Tit? Over.

25:14.833 --> 25:17.666
You got two of them snot rags
trooping the front.

25:17.667 --> 25:19.166
You got two around the back.

25:19.167 --> 25:21.457
And they're tooled up
to the max.

25:21.458 --> 25:22.458
Over.

25:22.459 --> 25:24.082
Copy that, Blue Tit.

25:24.083 --> 25:26.374
You're up, Thunder.

25:26.375 --> 25:27.417
Let's do this.

25:48.667 --> 25:51.333
Ronnie and Reggie, in position.

26:00.917 --> 26:02.500
Go, Reggie, go!

26:10.708 --> 26:11.999
What's going on, boys?

26:12.000 --> 26:15.208
Nothin', boss.
Motorbike a backfire.

26:21.292 --> 26:23.500
Right, stand down. As you were.

26:35.333 --> 26:37.332
<i>Ronnie and Reggie
are in the house.</i>

26:37.333 --> 26:39.093
Well done, now in and out,
fast as you can.

26:50.792 --> 26:52.291
<i>Live on one.</i>

26:52.292 --> 26:55.124
They're heading back inside.

26:55.125 --> 26:56.332
Snot rags coming back
into the gaff.

26:56.333 --> 26:57.582
Take cover, boys.

26:57.583 --> 26:58.874
What's going on out there?

26:58.875 --> 27:00.124
Nothing to worry about,

27:00.125 --> 27:01.958
just a motorbike backfiring,
sir.

27:04.042 --> 27:05.749
Brass monkeys out.
Do you fancy a brew?

27:05.750 --> 27:08.333
Yeah, milk and two,
stirred to the right.

27:17.625 --> 27:20.167
I'll stir you to the right,
you twat.

27:29.542 --> 27:31.792
Nouveau riche wanker.

27:41.708 --> 27:43.958
Ta.

27:50.708 --> 27:52.333
Ronnie!

28:00.125 --> 28:02.458
You are going down, Johnson.

28:34.667 --> 28:36.166
Are they in?

28:36.167 --> 28:37.500
They're creepin'.

28:42.292 --> 28:46.125
Creepers.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.916
Ooh-hoo!
I just nearly got it in.

28:56.917 --> 28:59.208
Right, mate, seen ya.

29:01.583 --> 29:03.499
We're live on two.

29:03.500 --> 29:05.250
<i>You're punching above
your weight, Peters.</i>

29:08.458 --> 29:10.333
<i>All right, come on.</i>

29:20.708 --> 29:24.667
Bad guys... they're everywhere.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.957
Sir.

29:29.958 --> 29:31.667
Well, this bad guy needs
a refill.

29:44.708 --> 29:49.457
Butch... I've got eyeballs on...

29:49.458 --> 29:53.000
one of the twins in the TV room.

29:55.250 --> 29:56.666
It's Ronnie.

29:56.667 --> 29:59.374
He's got some balls, that boy,
hasn't he?

29:59.375 --> 30:01.833
Here you are, sir.

30:10.458 --> 30:14.832
We've got a full house, boys.

30:14.833 --> 30:17.375
Edward G. Robinson's
a real man, sir.

30:18.500 --> 30:19.874
False alarm, boys.

30:19.875 --> 30:21.625
Reggie and Ronnie,
get back to base.

30:46.042 --> 30:48.207
Rack 'em up.

30:48.208 --> 30:50.499
<i>Double or quits here.
All right, stop whining.</i>

30:50.500 --> 30:52.020
You rack 'em up,
I'm gonna grab a beer.

30:58.458 --> 31:01.249
<i>You're a very bad boy, sir.</i>

31:01.250 --> 31:04.082
Is that all you've got, Dwyer?

31:04.083 --> 31:06.250
<i>Put your back into it,
for Christ's sake.</i>

31:08.750 --> 31:10.583
I'll shit you, Johnson.

31:11.750 --> 31:14.500
Prosecco? What a tosser.

31:24.208 --> 31:25.833
Knob head's got to have
a beer somewhere.

31:37.583 --> 31:39.125
Unh!

31:59.583 --> 32:02.374
<i>Ronnie and Reggie,
what is your status?</i>

32:02.375 --> 32:05.166
Ronnie had to nobble
one of the Heavy Mob, Butch.

32:05.167 --> 32:07.707
Now we're stuck in that larder.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.874
Well, get out of there,
sharpish.

32:09.875 --> 32:11.542
I'm workin' on it, Sundance.

32:15.625 --> 32:18.582
Come in, Butch Cassidy.
This is Blue Tit.

32:18.583 --> 32:21.207
<i>I am bored out of my nut.</i>

32:21.208 --> 32:24.791
Can I please
just shoot somebody now, over?

32:24.792 --> 32:26.791
No, you bloody well can't,
Blue Tit.

32:26.792 --> 32:28.792
Hold your position.

32:30.833 --> 32:32.083
Listen up, boys.

32:34.042 --> 32:37.124
Jones. No, I thought

32:37.125 --> 32:39.332
I was quite clear on this, dear.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.833
You're not to call
on my work line.

32:41.833 --> 32:43.041
Dinner?

32:43.042 --> 32:44.499
It's quite impossible, Patricia.

32:44.500 --> 32:45.832
I'm staying at
the country house tonight.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.332
Your parents are coming...

32:47.333 --> 32:49.832
Sounds like trouble
back at the ranch.

32:49.833 --> 32:52.332
Not feeling sorry
for him, are you, Dad?

32:52.333 --> 32:56.291
Sympathy and empathy
are worlds apart, Albert.

32:56.292 --> 32:58.791
<i>Supercedes official
police business.</i>

32:58.792 --> 33:00.249
Quite honestly,
you can feed them all

33:00.250 --> 33:02.166
dog food for all I care.

33:02.167 --> 33:03.792
Good night.

33:05.792 --> 33:07.875
That's the spirit, sir.

33:11.792 --> 33:15.207
Do you know, given the choice...

33:15.208 --> 33:16.874
I think...

33:16.875 --> 33:18.541
yeah, I-I think
I'd rather be Reggie.

33:18.542 --> 33:21.166
Shh.

33:21.167 --> 33:22.666
What are you talking about, son?

33:22.667 --> 33:24.832
Ronnie and Reggie Kray?

33:24.833 --> 33:27.207
Reggie was always
the cool one, wasn't her?

33:27.208 --> 33:28.499
Well, having worked
with 'em both,

33:28.500 --> 33:29.707
I don't recall either of them

33:29.708 --> 33:32.167
being particularly cool,
Charlie.

33:34.792 --> 33:37.332
You know,
if we ever do this again.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.166
I'd like to be Reggie next time.

33:39.167 --> 33:41.999
Whatever floats your boat, son.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.957
Butch Cassidy, there's no way
of getting out of here

33:43.958 --> 33:45.374
without kicking the door down.

33:45.375 --> 33:46.457
- Shit.
- Ooh.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.166
That is a negative, Reggie.

33:48.167 --> 33:50.416
You hold tight
until we get the intel,

33:50.417 --> 33:52.957
and then we will slip in
and, liberate ya.

33:52.958 --> 33:54.582
- Roger that.
- What are you talking about?

33:54.583 --> 33:55.957
We can't just
leave 'em in in there.

33:55.958 --> 33:58.207
They're big boys.
They're tucked away.

33:58.208 --> 34:00.207
If we charge in there now,
we will blow it.

34:00.208 --> 34:01.666
No, we wait
until we get the intel

34:01.667 --> 34:02.999
and the Heavy Mob leave.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.666
If they are compromised,

34:04.667 --> 34:07.042
we bust in there
all guns blazing.

34:09.833 --> 34:12.623
Listen, Albert...

34:12.625 --> 34:14.873
I lost it all before,

34:14.875 --> 34:17.331
and I'm not talking
about the gold.

34:17.333 --> 34:19.331
I will not take a chance

34:19.333 --> 34:21.791
if it means losing it all again.

34:21.792 --> 34:26.166
This, here, now,
is my dream come true.

34:26.167 --> 34:29.125
Me and my boy... together.

34:30.708 --> 34:32.416
Jesus Christ.

34:32.417 --> 34:33.916
You make it sound
like we're camping.

34:33.917 --> 34:36.041
I know. Never been happier.

34:36.042 --> 34:38.125
Or prouder.

34:41.750 --> 34:44.748
Never saw myself as taking
a back seat to a fella.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.831
Sweetheart, if our boys
do get the money,

34:46.833 --> 34:48.998
who do you think has to get
the plan in place to disappear?

34:49.000 --> 34:50.708
You really want to leave that
up to them?

34:52.667 --> 34:55.625
They are relying upon us
for the long game.

34:57.542 --> 34:59.499
Being the better half
to a bank robber

34:59.500 --> 35:02.791
requires a certain... gift.

35:02.792 --> 35:04.999
A certain spirit.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.457
You wait in the wings,
often for years,

35:07.458 --> 35:08.624
but when you're called upon

35:08.625 --> 35:10.832
you act with a cool head...

35:10.833 --> 35:12.500
and a clear conscience.

35:14.750 --> 35:17.416
Are we thinking
the Costa del Sol, Lily?

35:17.417 --> 35:19.541
No. Not the Costa.

35:19.542 --> 35:21.832
Too many old acquaintances
and bad beer.

35:21.833 --> 35:25.167
Somewhere more inland.
A lovely finca.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.832
Do you know, I've always
wanted to grow oranges?

35:28.833 --> 35:30.667
Got it.

35:37.792 --> 35:39.207
Jones here.

35:39.208 --> 35:41.583
About time, Petru.

35:42.792 --> 35:44.499
We're on.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.332
<i>Choppy waters out of Ajaccio.</i>

35:46.333 --> 35:48.624
<i>Yes, of course
we have the shipment.</i>

35:48.625 --> 35:51.750
<i>We're just waiting on
the exchange point.</i>

35:53.125 --> 35:55.708
Liverpool docks? Really?

35:56.708 --> 35:58.249
Ready?

35:58.250 --> 36:00.833
<i>That's quite some distance
from here.</i>

36:09.542 --> 36:11.222
<i>After the morning tide.
No, wait, I need...</i>

36:12.500 --> 36:15.333
<i>- Come on, come on.
- Pier number...</i>

36:18.500 --> 36:21.666
Dock number...

36:21.667 --> 36:22.916
Shit.

36:22.917 --> 36:25.791
<i>No, no, you listen to me.</i>

36:25.792 --> 36:28.832
There'll be
no more mistakes, Petru.

36:28.833 --> 36:30.667
We're on our way.

36:32.333 --> 36:34.416
We're on, Dwyer.

36:34.417 --> 36:36.166
<i>Get the boys
to load up the gold.</i>

36:36.167 --> 36:37.749
Liverpool docks.

36:37.750 --> 36:39.874
Coming in from Ajaccio before
the morning tide.

36:39.875 --> 36:41.457
Yeah, yeah, but that
narrows it down, though, right?

36:41.458 --> 36:43.082
Yeah, enough to follow
the scent, boys.

36:43.083 --> 36:44.999
Ronnie and Reggie,
stay in position.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.332
The eagle has landed,
the Heavy Mob are on the move.

36:47.333 --> 36:49.166
Blue Tit, what's the SP?

36:49.167 --> 36:51.499
Butch, they're on the move.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.707
Start 'er up, Benny-Boy.

36:52.708 --> 36:54.833
Okay.

37:02.375 --> 37:03.667
It won't start!

37:08.917 --> 37:10.750
Is that a Wood Lark?

37:18.042 --> 37:20.792
Shit, shit!

37:41.125 --> 37:43.875
Johnson!
We're movin' out, ya bellend.

38:15.917 --> 38:18.332
Butch... send in the cavalry.

38:18.333 --> 38:19.957
I'm going in.

38:19.958 --> 38:22.499
We are not going in now
with our dicks in our hands.

38:22.500 --> 38:26.333
It's time...
for the big boys' toys.

38:32.083 --> 38:33.333
Let's go.

38:51.667 --> 38:54.708
Fuck.

39:14.417 --> 39:17.250
No! No...

39:20.792 --> 39:22.458
Shit!

39:40.417 --> 39:43.208
It was him or me, son.

40:08.167 --> 40:09.750
Get the gold in the van! Now!

40:13.833 --> 40:16.333
Sir! Sir!

40:20.667 --> 40:22.387
Get the van, meet us around
the front. Go!

40:26.167 --> 40:28.042
Come on!

40:40.000 --> 40:42.416
It's no good, Vic.

40:42.417 --> 40:45.207
My guts are fallin' out.
Up you go, old man.

40:45.208 --> 40:47.292
I've got you. Come on, Norm.

40:50.167 --> 40:52.707
Vic...

40:52.708 --> 40:54.291
take Lily to the sun.

40:54.292 --> 40:56.499
Make her happy.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.875
I will, old friend. I promise.

41:08.500 --> 41:09.625
Go, Vic, go!

41:11.333 --> 41:13.292
Come on, sir, quick.

41:14.833 --> 41:17.125
Move out, move out!

41:20.917 --> 41:22.500
We're moving out!

41:42.042 --> 41:44.541
Billy!
Give me the bike keys, now!

41:44.542 --> 41:46.542
Come on, son, quick!

41:47.542 --> 41:49.166
Charlie, take this.

41:49.167 --> 41:50.666
Where's my dad?

41:50.667 --> 41:52.832
He's in the back of Jones's van.

41:52.833 --> 41:55.833
Let's get going, come on.
Now, now, now!

42:12.333 --> 42:13.750
Come on.

42:18.917 --> 42:20.833
Unh!
