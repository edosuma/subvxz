01:43.226 --> 01:46.363
Miss Lemmon! Miss Lemmon!

01:46.479 --> 01:48.537
Miss Lemmon!

01:50.442 --> 01:52.369
What?

01:52.485 --> 01:54.293
Doctor Warfield!

01:54.404 --> 01:57.077
Miss Lemmon, get Professor
Kelp in here immediately.

01:57.199 --> 02:00.881
But, Dr Warfield, I think Professor
Kelp has a class right now.

02:00.994 --> 02:04.593
He had a class. Can't you hear?

02:04.706 --> 02:06.384
Now, get him!

02:12.923 --> 02:14.565
Fire's up here.

02:18.094 --> 02:20.602
Get the axe! Get the axe!

02:22.849 --> 02:26.567
All right, men, all
together at the door.

02:29.898 --> 02:32.785
Look out! Look out! Look out!

02:47.374 --> 02:50.807
Oh, oh... I beg your pardon.

02:50.919 --> 02:53.771
Oh, but this is terrible!

02:55.757 --> 02:57.435
Oh...!

02:57.551 --> 03:00.936
Oh... Oh...

03:01.054 --> 03:02.981
Oh, my...!

03:04.724 --> 03:07.066
Professor Kelp?

03:07.185 --> 03:14.284
Are you all right? And if you
are, where are you all right?

03:17.112 --> 03:19.288
Oh, my...

03:39.134 --> 03:41.725
Dr Warfield wants to
see you in his office.

03:41.845 --> 03:44.697
- Dr Warfield?
- Yes, right away.

03:44.806 --> 03:49.034
I used too much...

05:22.404 --> 05:24.295
Kelp.

05:24.406 --> 05:28.717
How long have you been on the
faculty of this university?

05:28.827 --> 05:33.174
Well, now, I would say, er...

05:33.290 --> 05:38.632
prior to my exposure as a student
counsellor, USC, three years...

05:38.753 --> 05:41.641
No, I went to post-grad,
naturally, two years... No...

05:41.756 --> 05:45.060
I had a botany exposure in
one particular school...

05:45.177 --> 05:49.855
I had decided, pre-med, botany, whatever,
I would prefer the sciences...

05:49.973 --> 05:53.240
I think I should go back
to when I graduated...

05:53.351 --> 05:55.325
How long?!

06:12.495 --> 06:14.921
Two years and 22 minutes now.

06:15.040 --> 06:19.137
Kelp, as I recall, upon
your arrival here,

06:19.252 --> 06:22.223
I told you and the other
new faculty members,

06:22.339 --> 06:27.599
I will not stand for any member of staff
utilising the university's facilities

06:27.719 --> 06:30.227
for his or her own
personal experiments.

06:30.347 --> 06:33.282
Did I not make myself
perfectly clear?

06:33.391 --> 06:37.110
Good, I knew my memory
served me well.

06:38.104 --> 06:41.205
And Kelp, wasn't it
approximately six weeks later

06:41.316 --> 06:45.034
that you conducted a rather interesting
experiment before your class?

06:45.153 --> 06:50.627
Let me see... I think it had something
to do with an additive to gasolene

06:50.742 --> 06:55.255
for the purpose of increasing the
efficiency of the combustion engine.

06:55.372 --> 07:00.050
- Right?
- Yes, it was something to that effect...

07:00.168 --> 07:02.938
Do you recall what
that additive was?

07:03.046 --> 07:07.274
Yes, as a matter of fact, now that
you bring it up, the additive was

07:07.384 --> 07:12.726
3 parts carbon, 5 parts hydrogen,
1 part nitrogen, 3 parts oxygen.

07:12.848 --> 07:15.485
- Which, of course, is?
- Nitroglycerine.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.776
- The results were?
- Negative.

07:17.894 --> 07:19.786
- And?
- Noisy.

07:19.896 --> 07:21.704
Noisy!

07:21.815 --> 07:27.585
It was the worst explosion in the history
of this or any other university.

07:27.696 --> 07:31.745
That was two years ago and they're
still talking about it today.

07:31.867 --> 07:35.585
Now you mention it, I saw
young Phips the other day.

07:35.704 --> 07:38.295
You recall Arnold Phips
was in my class that day?

07:38.665 --> 07:41.470
Yes, really, what
did he have to say?

07:41.585 --> 07:45.552
He's feeling much better and the
bandages should be off in two weeks.

07:45.672 --> 07:48.773
Oh, well, a couple... Exactly!
That's exactly what I mean!

07:48.884 --> 07:50.608
You are a menace.

07:52.220 --> 07:56.532
Professor Kelp, believe me, I
know what I'm talking about.

07:56.641 --> 07:59.659
Kelp, it's human nature.

07:59.769 --> 08:04.033
Kelp, people just don't like
teachers blowing up their kids.

08:07.986 --> 08:11.206
Kelp, try to understand
that I understand

08:11.323 --> 08:16.761
that scientists and creators have
their little eccentricities.

08:16.870 --> 08:20.718
Einstein hated haircuts, da Vinci
loved to paint and Newton...

08:20.832 --> 08:22.889
Didn't he have something
to do with figs?

08:23.001 --> 08:30.064
So therefore I, too, realise that you
have many of the same eccentricities.

08:30.175 --> 08:34.522
Leave them in the locker when you
come in in the morning, Professor.

08:34.638 --> 08:37.941
And feel free to take
them home at night.

08:43.020 --> 08:46.537
All right, Kelp,
simmer down and relax.

08:46.650 --> 08:52.622
I'm sure we won't have to have another
talk like this again. Am I correct?

08:52.739 --> 08:56.588
Oh, without question,
you're absolutely...

08:56.701 --> 08:59.506
yes, we'll never have
to correct our talk.

08:59.621 --> 09:01.180
We won't ever speak...

09:01.331 --> 09:05.643
That is, we'll never have to talk again.
We just never will discuss talking.

09:05.752 --> 09:09.351
Er, we shouldn't really
converse about speaking.

09:09.464 --> 09:13.396
Professor, our discussion
has come to an end.

09:13.510 --> 09:15.567
- Thank you, Dr...
- Kelp.

09:15.679 --> 09:17.237
Yes?

09:18.515 --> 09:20.157
Your watch...

09:20.267 --> 09:22.692
does it...

09:22.811 --> 09:24.453
always?

09:24.563 --> 09:28.874
Oh, no, just when I open...

09:37.993 --> 09:40.381
Those are your greens.

09:55.677 --> 09:57.935
Hi, how are you?

10:02.809 --> 10:05.993
"Therefore, through history,

10:06.104 --> 10:07.864
"man has been curious..."

10:07.981 --> 10:11.248
- Professor Kelp.
- Yes, Worfshefski?

10:11.359 --> 10:15.457
- I have to go...
- You have to go?

10:15.572 --> 10:18.756
Since when did you find it
necessary to ask permission to go?

10:18.867 --> 10:23.759
No, well, what I meant to say,
Professor Kelp, was that...

10:23.872 --> 10:26.889
I have to go to football practice.

10:27.292 --> 10:29.349
Football practice?

10:29.461 --> 10:32.052
At this hour?
What about your studies?

10:32.172 --> 10:35.855
Well, Mr Coughman, the coach,

10:35.967 --> 10:39.567
he asked me to try and get off
my first class this morning...

10:39.679 --> 10:42.864
Get off your first class?

10:42.974 --> 10:45.530
Did he, now? To get
off your first class?

10:45.644 --> 10:49.576
Mr Worfshefski, had you learned
anything in your first class,

10:49.689 --> 10:52.459
and I refer to the
elementary class,

10:52.567 --> 10:56.831
you might not be in such
dire need of learning now.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.917
Your request is denied.
Please sit down.

11:00.033 --> 11:03.502
I don't want to hear another
word about your stupid practice.

11:04.496 --> 11:09.009
You don't have no call to go yelling
at me like that, Professor Kelp.

11:09.125 --> 11:13.887
Worfshefski, I might
have been a little rash.

11:14.005 --> 11:17.605
That wasn't very nice
calling my practice stupid.

11:17.717 --> 11:20.854
I meant I was stupid in
assuming practice was stupid.

11:20.971 --> 11:24.356
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

11:24.474 --> 11:25.949
- Teacher!
- Well, you shouldn't be upset.

11:26.059 --> 11:29.409
W... W... Worfshefski,
you're breaking my...

11:29.521 --> 11:32.990
There goes the tibia. Worfshefski,
you're... Worfshefski!

11:33.108 --> 11:35.497
You must realise that...

11:35.610 --> 11:37.712
You don't realise what
you're doing, Worfshefski.

11:37.737 --> 11:41.538
Worfshefski, you don't
realise what you're doing.

11:47.831 --> 11:50.504
Well, just don't do
something, sit there!

11:50.625 --> 11:53.347
Er, that is... class dismissed!

11:53.461 --> 11:55.388
You may go.

12:00.218 --> 12:03.070
Can I be of any assistance,
Professor Kelp?

12:07.767 --> 12:09.492
Oh, er...

12:10.770 --> 12:14.738
Thank you, Miss Purdy, you're
very, very considerate.

12:14.858 --> 12:17.330
Actually, I would
appreciate the assistance

12:17.444 --> 12:24.081
for were it not for you assisting me
I might very well be here all semester.

12:24.659 --> 12:28.674
Well, er, let's start
with the book.

12:28.788 --> 12:32.257
Yeah... I don't know, I...

12:36.505 --> 12:38.893
You have to... The, er...

12:39.007 --> 12:42.143
Wait, it's connected, you
better not press that.

12:42.719 --> 12:44.859
Just pull it out, Miss Purdy.

12:44.971 --> 12:47.278
Oh, that really snapped.

12:47.390 --> 12:49.779
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

12:49.893 --> 12:53.658
- Try leaning.
- Oh, no, no, no, no...

12:53.772 --> 12:56.992
Let me just... Let
me have this arm...

12:57.108 --> 13:01.954
Just may I have that arm? All right,
you just hold some of the body...

13:06.368 --> 13:08.092
Thank you, thank you.

13:08.203 --> 13:10.876
- Thank you, Miss Purdy.
- Are you all right, Professor?

13:10.997 --> 13:14.965
Oh, yes, this is very
embarrassing, Miss Purdy.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.094
Why don't you call me
Stella, Professor?

13:17.212 --> 13:19.554
I thought it was Stella Purdy.

13:19.673 --> 13:23.936
Oh, you mean to call you Stella?
How stupid of me. Sorry.

13:24.052 --> 13:26.560
I will, stupid... Er, Stella.

13:26.680 --> 13:30.113
I'm very upset. It's
very embarrassing.

13:32.310 --> 13:38.116
Honestly, Professor, you shouldn't
let a big ox like that bother you.

13:38.233 --> 13:43.125
He's the typical bully that
loves picking on a small man.

13:44.447 --> 13:47.465
Yes, yes, you're right, Miss Purdy,

13:47.576 --> 13:52.005
but you'd best run along or
you'll miss your next class.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.930
You're all right?

13:54.040 --> 13:59.811
Oh, yes, as I said, I'm just
embarrassed. I'm fine, thank you.

14:10.390 --> 14:12.115
Er, Miss Purdy...

14:15.645 --> 14:17.738
Miss Pur... Excuse me.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.367
The, er...

14:33.246 --> 14:38.222
He's a typical bully that loves
picking on a small man...

14:38.335 --> 14:42.135
picking on a small man...
picking on a small man...

15:02.609 --> 15:04.748
I think I broke myself.

15:43.483 --> 15:47.996
Wrong way, sir. This is the gym.
I take it you're new?

15:48.113 --> 15:52.293
- Well, I'm not brand new.
- No, I mean a new student.

15:59.374 --> 16:02.973
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Are you hurt?

16:03.086 --> 16:08.181
Well, actually, if you would
say that a man with an ulcer,

16:08.300 --> 16:12.611
a nail in his shoe and a splinter in his
finger was then struck by lightning...

16:12.721 --> 16:16.272
If you could say he wasn't
hurt then I'm not hurt.

16:16.391 --> 16:19.029
Good. By the way, we don't
wear glasses at Vic Tanny's.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.071
Fine, I'll just take these off.

16:21.188 --> 16:24.372
I didn't realise that you're
not supposed to, er...

16:24.482 --> 16:28.497
There's nowhere really that I...
Is there some place I could put?

16:28.612 --> 16:32.875
- Shall I put these in a locker?
- I'd appreciate it. You're very kind.

16:32.991 --> 16:37.338
I would've put them there had I
known that there was a restriction.

16:37.454 --> 16:40.887
Some people use them for a
façade, I wear them for eyes.

16:40.999 --> 16:44.598
You see, "for eyes",
it's a play on "eyes".

16:44.711 --> 16:48.595
I hope I did nothing wrong by
wearing them. I didn't realise.

16:48.715 --> 16:52.149
If we could get started. I do have
a class and need to get going.

16:52.260 --> 16:53.985
- Come with me.
- Wonderful.

16:54.095 --> 16:58.489
I've never done this before.
I don't know where to begin.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.324
We start right here.

17:00.435 --> 17:01.910
Identical twins.

17:02.020 --> 17:06.829
- No, that's a pulling machine.
- A pulling machine? What does it do?

17:06.942 --> 17:12.665
- You pull it! 15 or 20 pulls to begin with.
- Oh, I see.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.123
- And take it easy.
- Naturally.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.545
I wouldn't strain myself for the
world. Thank you very much.

17:18.662 --> 17:21.431
You're welcome. Er, happy muscles.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.928
Yes, I certainly do.

17:30.507 --> 17:34.225
Oh, yes, I've seen that
in those magazines.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.443
Oh, that's invigorating.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.414
Oh, that's terrific.

17:54.447 --> 17:59.672
I'm going to have a great deal
of fun with this, I can tell.

18:01.246 --> 18:06.471
"the various aspects, of
course, is relativity to hydrogen.

18:06.585 --> 18:13.683
"There is hydrogen, duly explosive and
more devastating than the atomic.

18:13.800 --> 18:20.152
"There is equally the devastation
in nitrogen... nitrogen, equally..."

19:37.926 --> 19:41.395
I couldn't help but notice -
I was standing here -

19:41.513 --> 19:47.117
that's amazing, the way you
push those things up there.

19:47.227 --> 19:50.032
It must take a great
deal of patience.

19:50.146 --> 19:52.654
And a little muscle.

19:52.774 --> 19:56.824
Oh, yes. Well, you certainly are...
Yes, you are...

19:56.945 --> 20:01.541
I'd love to be able to... I would
really enjoy trying that some time.

20:01.658 --> 20:05.044
I don't think you'd have
the patience for it.

20:05.161 --> 20:08.179
I have the other thing you
mentioned: A little muscle.

20:08.290 --> 20:12.257
I say, that was, er,
sort of a corker!

20:12.377 --> 20:14.553
Here, enjoy yourself.

20:28.810 --> 20:33.821
I, er... I suspect it was
somewhat heavier than I...

20:49.497 --> 20:51.970
- uncanny.
- I agree, Doctor.

20:53.627 --> 20:57.475
But there are a couple of points
that I neglected to mention.

20:57.589 --> 21:02.102
Specifically, the day I went to
Vic Tanny, I got on the scale,

21:02.219 --> 21:04.691
as they normally do,
to check you in,

21:04.804 --> 21:08.854
and I weighed 153 pounds,
and then after six months,

21:08.975 --> 21:14.318
I weighed myself on that very same
scale, and I found that I weighed 151.

21:15.732 --> 21:18.157
Very interesting, Professor Kelp.

21:19.194 --> 21:24.288
But I am surprised that a man with
your education and background

21:24.407 --> 21:27.508
should be intimidated by
a bully to this extent.

21:27.619 --> 21:32.013
Plus, you must know, only some men
react to bodybuilding exercise,

21:32.123 --> 21:34.679
whereas others just don't.

21:38.797 --> 21:42.230
Professor, revenge can't be
that important to you.

21:42.342 --> 21:45.111
I must take objection
there, Doctor.

21:45.220 --> 21:48.155
Revenge might have been
the motivating force,

21:48.265 --> 21:52.528
but I feel that curiosity has
taken over where revenge began.

21:52.644 --> 21:57.904
I am more or less being compelled by
completing something that I started.

21:58.024 --> 22:01.458
I must finish what I start,
finish what I start.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.243
I admire a man who likes
to see something through,

22:04.364 --> 22:06.955
but your six months have failed.

22:07.075 --> 22:11.339
- What will you do now?
- I actually don't know, Doctor.

22:11.454 --> 22:14.390
That's why I wanted to see you.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.968
I had one plan and I thought
I'd mention it to you.

22:18.086 --> 22:23.181
Chemistry is probably what I know
best, that's all I know, really.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.354
Some of the world's finest
pharmaceutical companies

22:26.469 --> 22:31.646
make bodybuilding minerals, vitamins,
chemicals all based on chemistry,

22:31.766 --> 22:34.820
so I'd approach it from
a chemistry standpoint.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.408
To prove a point, I'll show you...

22:37.522 --> 22:41.869
Oh, Professor, excuse me,
I seem to have run out of time.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.959
I'm due at the hospital.

22:44.070 --> 22:49.591
I'm terribly sorry, I never realised
the time. In fact, I have a class...

22:55.790 --> 22:59.935
Go ahead, but I'd like to browse
around if it's all right.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.054
Not at all.

23:02.172 --> 23:07.646
- I hope you find what you're looking for.
- You're terribly kind. Thank you.

23:08.803 --> 23:14.657
Let's see, anatomy, body structure,
structure of body muscle...

23:36.915 --> 23:40.598
"Man's growth,
physically and mentally.

23:41.211 --> 23:45.854
"A man's mind, from childhood to
old age, never stops growing.

23:45.966 --> 23:51.226
"Not in size or by measure, but by
constant learning and knowledge.

23:52.639 --> 23:56.404
"On the other hand, man's
body stops at a point,

23:56.518 --> 23:58.860
"that of completion of the anatomy,

23:58.979 --> 24:02.495
"yet we have learned, through
chemistry... " Ha, ha, ha!

24:02.607 --> 24:06.041
"man can grow further with
the aid of additional elements."

24:53.074 --> 24:58.417
Seven weeks and 13 experiments have
gone by with little or no strides made,

24:58.538 --> 25:02.553
but today I'm certain
my formula will work,

25:02.667 --> 25:07.228
so certain that I plan
trying it on myself tonight.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.031
Tonight.

25:32.155 --> 25:33.915
Oh, I'm really...

25:34.032 --> 25:40.087
Oh, Miss Purdy, I'm terribly sorry.
Just let me get you up there, dear.

25:40.205 --> 25:44.599
That's just ridiculous. I never...
I just swung the door...

25:44.709 --> 25:49.518
It's all right. You just
knocked the breath out of me.

25:49.631 --> 25:53.776
- So stupid of me.
- I'm perfectly all right. No harm done.

25:53.885 --> 25:58.528
- That's fine.
- Did anyone invite you for tonight?

25:58.640 --> 26:02.191
Invite me? I don't
think so... Where?

26:02.310 --> 26:07.867
The class is having a mid-term party at the
Purple Pit. We'd love you to join us.

26:07.983 --> 26:12.330
Thank you, it's terribly considerate
and kind of you, and I appreciate it,

26:12.445 --> 26:16.460
and I've always said there should
be a closer interrelationship

26:16.575 --> 26:19.841
between the student and the
faculty based on better learning,

26:19.953 --> 26:24.514
yet the Purple Pit is off limits
to the faculty of the university.

26:24.624 --> 26:26.053
Didn't you know?

26:26.168 --> 26:29.434
Oh, I forgot. I'm sorry, Professor.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.219
I guess it slipped my mind,

26:32.340 --> 26:37.897
but the Pit's never been what it's
supposed to be, by reputation anyway.

26:38.013 --> 26:42.407
You know, I, too, have heard
it's a wild, terrible place,

26:42.517 --> 26:48.453
when it's really just a quaint spot
where the students can talk and relax

26:48.565 --> 26:51.500
and just generally get acquainted.

26:51.610 --> 26:56.787
And when you really get
down to it, it's quite dull.

27:27.854 --> 27:32.663
- broads.
- They'll be glad. You gotta do it.

27:32.984 --> 27:34.828
Why not?

27:34.945 --> 27:37.749
Stella, couldn't you
talk Kelp into coming?

27:37.864 --> 27:42.460
Can you imagine the professor here?
He'd break into a rash.

27:42.577 --> 27:46.805
Don't be too sure. Professor Kelp's just
the kind of guy who might fool you.

27:47.165 --> 27:50.551
I bet he likes to get out
on his own a little.

27:50.669 --> 27:56.522
I'll bet you right now he's probably
on his way to a secret rendezvous

27:56.633 --> 27:59.817
with a mysterious,
dark-haired female.

28:40.510 --> 28:42.437
Come in, Julius.

28:50.979 --> 28:54.329
Er, how are you tonight, Jennifer?

28:54.441 --> 28:57.114
- How are you, Julius?
- I'm fine.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.664
I am, too-lius.

28:58.778 --> 29:03.125
Now, be very quiet, Jennifer.
We have a lot of work to do.

29:03.241 --> 29:06.591
- Tonight's the big night.
- Keep very quiet.

29:06.703 --> 29:12.010
He's got a lot of work to do.
Tonight's the big night. The big night.

29:43.406 --> 29:46.044
Well, we're just about
ready, Jennifer.

29:46.159 --> 29:51.170
You might be ready, Julius, but if
I were you, I'd think about it.

29:51.289 --> 29:55.221
Think, think, you'd better think.

29:55.335 --> 29:57.593
Better think about it.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.748
I told you, Julius.
I told you, Julius.

33:08.862 --> 33:13.256
I told you, Julius. I told you...

34:06.378 --> 34:10.606
Thank you very much, sir.
We know you'll be very happy.

34:10.715 --> 34:14.065
And you look just stunning.

34:14.177 --> 34:19.105
And we'll have your other suits and
things no later than next week.

36:25.851 --> 36:30.411
- What'll it be?
- Ah, that's no way to talk! Tsk-tsk!

36:30.522 --> 36:34.240
"What'll it be?" That's no
way to treat a customer.

36:34.359 --> 36:36.286
Come here. Pay attention.

36:36.403 --> 36:39.172
You'll feel better and
customers'll be happier.

36:39.281 --> 36:43.165
Try this: "What'll it
be, hmm?" Try that.

36:43.285 --> 36:46.089
Come on, we haven't
got all night. Try it.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.926
What'll it be... mmm?

36:49.040 --> 36:52.675
Good, that was wonderful. Did anyone
ever tell you you couldn't sing?

36:52.794 --> 36:57.889
Nice. Make me an Alaskan Polar Bear
Heater on the double. Come on.

37:00.760 --> 37:05.190
Say, why don't you pick on
somebody your own disposition?

37:06.391 --> 37:11.912
Oh, please, Mr Bar-room Brawler,
don't hurt me or anything like that.

37:26.536 --> 37:29.388
- Did you say Polar Bear Heater?
- No, you did.

37:29.497 --> 37:33.595
- I said an Alaskan Polar Bear Heater.
- I never heard of that.

37:33.710 --> 37:36.479
Until now. All right,
pay attention.

37:36.588 --> 37:39.309
- Two shots of vodka.
- Two shots of vodka.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.018
- A little rum.
- A little rum.

37:41.134 --> 37:43.690
- Some bitters.
- Bitters.

37:43.803 --> 37:47.948
- And a smidgin of vinegar.
- And a smidgin of...

37:48.058 --> 37:51.028
You gonna drink this or
rub it on your chest?

37:51.144 --> 37:56.451
That was terrific! Did you hear that,
folks? A regular George Bernard Shaw.

37:56.566 --> 38:00.746
Good boy! And he did it all by himself.
You did it all by yourself without help.

38:00.862 --> 38:03.714
That's terrific. And
with your own big mouth.

38:03.823 --> 38:08.087
If you don't want the cocktail shaker in
your gums, shut up and pay attention.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.545
- Is that clear? Repeat after me: I'll...
- I'll...

38:10.664 --> 38:13.848
- I'll pay attention.
- I'll pay attention.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.767
All right, let's continue.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.804
- A shot of vermouth.
- A shot of vermouth.

38:17.921 --> 38:19.563
- A shot of gin.
- A little gin.

38:19.673 --> 38:21.433
- A little brandy.
- A little brandy.

38:21.550 --> 38:23.108
- Lemon peel.
- Lemon peel.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.942
- Orange peel.
- Orange peel.

38:25.053 --> 38:26.813
Cherry.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.069
- Some more Scotch.
- More Scotch.

38:29.182 --> 38:34.193
Now, mix it nice, then
pour it into a tall glass.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.829
I never tried this.
Mind if I take a sip?

38:39.943 --> 38:42.036
Go right ahead.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.751
Not bad.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.877
Hi.

39:29.993 --> 39:32.335
I don't know any better place

39:32.454 --> 39:36.254
to get to know a lovely lady
than on the dance floor.

39:36.374 --> 39:40.768
- I hope you don't refuse.
- I'm sorry, I'm with...

39:40.879 --> 39:45.475
- Move along, sonny. She's with us.
- Sh! Sit down.

39:45.592 --> 39:49.986
Come here, honey. Stand up a minute.
Just there. I'll be right back.

39:50.096 --> 39:53.612
We don't want trouble,
do we? Sit like nice boys.

39:53.725 --> 39:57.905
Would you like me to tell Dr Warfield,
my personal friend, of your bad manners?

39:58.021 --> 40:01.075
He would be very
displeased. So cool it.

40:01.191 --> 40:07.329
If you're nice lads, cute little chappies,
later on I'll let you twirl my key-chain.

40:07.447 --> 40:09.872
Now, relax.

40:09.991 --> 40:13.176
It's all straight, baby.
Put your arm up there.

40:13.286 --> 40:17.218
Remember how they do that in the
movies? They walk like high class.

40:17.332 --> 40:20.516
Dancing, nice. We're hugging.
It's wonderful.

40:20.627 --> 40:22.766
Clear the floor.

40:48.989 --> 40:51.377
I know what you're thinking.

40:52.325 --> 40:55.592
Where's he been all my life, right?

40:57.122 --> 40:59.298
No, not exactly.

41:00.208 --> 41:05.729
And that you're happy the way I
handled those three goons, right?

41:07.424 --> 41:11.735
Well, normally, I would
have belted them.

41:13.346 --> 41:16.364
But I didn't want
to muss myself up,

41:16.474 --> 41:21.118
and have you dance with
a sloppy guy. Dig?

41:24.149 --> 41:29.409
Then, you restrained yourself,
just for little old me.

41:29.529 --> 41:31.918
I knew you'd appreciate it.

41:33.033 --> 41:36.466
I do a lot of nice things.

41:37.954 --> 41:44.971
Is that really the case or is this
line 27 a for young college girls?

41:45.086 --> 41:50.857
Aw, now, you see?
You went and done it.

41:52.135 --> 41:57.526
One of the rare times in my life
when I dig down into the soul,

41:57.641 --> 42:00.148
and you doubt my veracity?

42:00.268 --> 42:01.946
Well, that hurts.

42:04.940 --> 42:09.536
Well, it's not your
veracity that I doubt.

42:13.031 --> 42:16.749
- The music's stopped.
- Yeah, I heard.

42:18.161 --> 42:20.717
Hold it a second. Hold... Hold it.

42:20.830 --> 42:24.015
We'll make our own music,
gorgeous. Just hold it.

42:24.125 --> 42:27.891
You and you stay. Tubby, go
rest your thumbs. I'll drive.

42:28.004 --> 42:31.189
- Sweetie, go get your lips pressed.
- Split. - Listen...

42:31.299 --> 42:35.479
You listen. Sit down. You'll be
thrilled. Believe you me.

42:35.595 --> 42:38.530
Sit and listen and watch.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.400
Mood is wrong!

42:40.517 --> 42:44.365
Innkeeper, got sexy lights?
Lay it on me.

42:44.479 --> 42:47.366
Better. Better. Now, watch, baby.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.915
Every move a picture.

43:01.496 --> 43:06.507

Back. Back! Thank you, kiddies. You're
all very nice little boys and girls.

44:59.865 --> 45:04.792
If you're real nice, tomorrow night I might
ration out a little more of this rare talent.

45:04.911 --> 45:08.760
Now, back to your seats,
back. Go on, go on.

45:08.874 --> 45:10.765
Back, back, back.

45:12.252 --> 45:16.219
They're nice kids, all nice.
All nice kids.

45:16.339 --> 45:18.847
They have very good
taste, I might add.

45:18.967 --> 45:24.274
I'm glad. It would be a shame to waste
the genius of yours on the riff-raff.

45:24.389 --> 45:27.360
Honey, I always say, if
you're good and you know it,

45:27.475 --> 45:31.194
why waste time beating
around the bush, true?

45:32.355 --> 45:38.209
And I always say that to love yourself
is the beginning of a lifelong romance,

45:38.320 --> 45:43.545
and after watching you, I know you
and you will be very happy together.

45:43.658 --> 45:46.843
Just a minute, sweetheart.
I don't recall dismissing you.

45:47.913 --> 45:51.346
You rude, discourteous egomaniac.

45:51.458 --> 45:53.764
You're crazy about me, right?

45:53.877 --> 45:56.468
This morning, looking
in the mirror,

45:56.588 --> 46:00.555
I enjoyed what I saw so much,
I couldn't tear myself away.

46:00.675 --> 46:02.104
Have some, baby?

46:02.802 --> 46:06.568
If I were your baby,
I'd be swinging from a tree.

46:06.681 --> 46:11.408
- Aw, Stella, that's not nice.
- How do you know my name?

46:13.188 --> 46:14.948
Well, we were introduced.

46:15.065 --> 46:19.459
No, we weren't introduced, or I would
have remembered your name.

46:19.569 --> 46:21.377
Tell me how you knew.

46:21.488 --> 46:26.582
You've heard of ESP, extrasensory
perception. I'm a firm believer in ESP...

46:26.701 --> 46:29.257
Hey, buddy, you really
sang up a storm.

46:29.371 --> 46:32.222
Yeah, I know. Thanks a lot.

46:32.332 --> 46:36.050
Well, you heard him.
Everybody knows Buddy.

46:36.169 --> 46:37.763
- Buddy?
- Yeah.

46:37.879 --> 46:43.140
Well, is that it? Or do you find it
difficult remembering two of them?

46:43.260 --> 46:46.064
Hey, you're kooky. That was cute.

46:46.179 --> 46:48.817
"Do you find it difficult
remembering two of them?"

46:48.932 --> 46:52.033
Wonderful! I knew you'd
be a barrel of laughs.

46:52.143 --> 46:54.781
No, I don't find it
difficult remembering two.

46:54.896 --> 46:56.989
<i>- ♪ Love, love, love... ♪</i>
- Buddy...

46:57.107 --> 47:00.373
Love. That's it. Buddy Love.

47:00.485 --> 47:02.044
Buddy Love?

47:02.153 --> 47:05.705
Of the Los Angeles Loves.
But that's of no consequence.

47:05.824 --> 47:08.960
- Shall we make a move?
- Where?

47:09.077 --> 47:11.668
- Do you have a car?
- Of course.

47:11.788 --> 47:15.174
- Crazy. Let's split.
- Let's split what?

47:15.292 --> 47:17.468
- Is it new?
- Not brand new.

47:17.586 --> 47:22.561
- I've driven it a whole week.
- Nutty! Let's go.

47:41.234 --> 47:45.498
Here, baby. Wipe the lipstick off,
slide over here and let's get started.

47:46.781 --> 47:52.421
We have started and finished. And for an
encore, get an earful of the following.

47:52.537 --> 47:55.009
I'll admit you're a
very sharp-looking guy.

47:55.123 --> 47:57.892
And you certainly have that
proverbial gift of the gab.

47:58.001 --> 48:00.509
I've only gone this far

48:00.629 --> 48:05.936
because when you meet someone like
you, your curiosity gets stirred up.

48:06.051 --> 48:10.279
Well, mister, this is one kitten that
won't be smitten by that little old devil.

48:10.388 --> 48:15.400
So turn this car around and take me
right back where you picked me up.

48:15.519 --> 48:18.026
That is, where we met.

48:18.146 --> 48:20.915
I said wipe the lipstick off.

48:33.245 --> 48:35.302
Was it something I said?

48:35.413 --> 48:37.553
You must be deranged.

48:41.962 --> 48:47.981
If you don't believe in idle chatter and
a lot of small talk, yeah, I'm deranged.

48:48.093 --> 48:52.606
You'd prefer I conduct myself like
the little boys you usually date?

48:53.682 --> 48:56.699
Nothing delights us more
than being enjoyed,

48:56.810 --> 49:00.954
appreciated or just plain
liked by someone, right?

49:02.482 --> 49:05.702
You're not going to tell me

49:05.819 --> 49:11.672
that you're here with me now
because I don't appeal to you.

49:11.783 --> 49:18.681
And I'm sure that you can see I
dig you pretty good, too, right?

49:18.790 --> 49:22.473
Well, isn't it easier to say so?

49:22.586 --> 49:25.603
Would you prefer I used
that phoney dialogue

49:25.714 --> 49:30.641
I'm sure you've heard at least
a half a dozen times before?

49:30.760 --> 49:32.900
So you see, Stell,

49:33.013 --> 49:38.451
when I tell you that you're a
vibrant, beautiful, exciting woman,

49:38.560 --> 49:42.954
you can believe me, you
can bet it's the truth.

49:43.064 --> 49:50.294
Because I'd have to be a complete idiot
not to want to hold you and kiss you,

49:50.405 --> 49:54.550
and make our time together
a warm, wonderful moment

49:54.659 --> 50:02.091
that could grow and develop
into many moments, many hours,

50:02.209 --> 50:04.467
and into something
really important.

50:06.713 --> 50:10.858
Nobody ever said anything
like that to me before.

50:11.426 --> 50:17.280
Nor can I ever remember a more honest
approach to two people being together.

50:18.892 --> 50:21.697
That's what I want
you to understand.

50:21.811 --> 50:25.992
Actually, I've never had, er...

50:26.107 --> 50:27.785
er, that is, er...

50:29.444 --> 50:32.249
er, what I mean is, er...

50:49.047 --> 50:50.689
Miss Purdy...

50:53.552 --> 50:55.229
Hello, Miss Purdy!

50:56.304 --> 50:58.730
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Professor.

50:58.849 --> 51:02.697
That's perfectly all right, Miss
Purdy, I hope I didn't wake you.

51:02.811 --> 51:08.664
I don't recall excluding you from the other
class members from taking this test.

51:08.775 --> 51:14.748
I'm terribly sorry, Professor,
I was just getting ready to start.

51:14.865 --> 51:19.258
Oh, just getting ready to start.
Splendid, splendid. Just getting ready.

51:21.079 --> 51:26.090
Students, please be aware that the test
papers must go on my desk for marking,

51:26.209 --> 51:29.844
also please be equally aware
of tomorrow's problem:

51:29.963 --> 51:33.728
H20 plus NO2 as we did the
other day, if you recall.

51:33.842 --> 51:37.026
I'm awfully sorry, and if
it would be agreeable,

51:37.137 --> 51:40.321
I'd like to stay after my
last class and take the test.

51:40.807 --> 51:46.494
Well, that's highly irregular, Miss
Purdy, but, er... we... we're...

51:46.605 --> 51:48.614
Are you all right, Miss Purdy?

51:48.732 --> 51:54.122
I'll know better tonight. I mean,
yes, sir, I'm quite all right.

51:54.237 --> 51:57.706
Oh, fine, then I'll
see you tonight...

51:57.824 --> 52:01.423
That is, after your last class,
as you said, to take the test.

52:01.953 --> 52:04.260
- Yes.
- Fine. I'll hold your paper.

52:04.372 --> 52:08.091
- Thank you.
- You're quite welcome.

52:08.210 --> 52:12.141
Be certain that it's
after your last class.

52:12.255 --> 52:15.938
I'll be marking these
papers accordingly.

53:38.425 --> 53:40.019
Professor.

53:41.303 --> 53:44.273
Ye... Ye... Oh, yes, Gibson?

53:44.389 --> 53:47.739
- I've got that book you asked for.
- Thank you.

53:47.851 --> 53:51.450
- My pleasure.
- Yeah, wonderful.

53:51.563 --> 53:53.241
Oh...

53:53.356 --> 53:55.698
Now, then...

53:55.817 --> 54:01.623
As you might very well recall,
yesterday in "Discussing Biology":

54:01.740 --> 54:07.843
"The long legs of the beetle and
the wonderful body of the ant."

54:08.872 --> 54:11.641
No, what I meant to say was:

54:11.750 --> 54:14.175
"The beautiful hair
of the blonde fish."

54:14.294 --> 54:18.474
No, actually...
Er, no... "The legs..."

54:19.174 --> 54:21.231
"terrific looking..."

54:22.093 --> 54:25.728
I am completely aware of what
chemistry and drugs can do

54:25.847 --> 54:28.569
to assist and aid
the body and mind.

54:28.683 --> 54:34.204
Yet I don't really believe what happened
to me comes strictly from chemistry.

54:34.314 --> 54:38.032
There must be an explanation
for this phenomenon.

54:40.362 --> 54:42.704
- Jennifer...
- Hi, sweetie.

54:42.822 --> 54:47.419
I knew I was on the right track, but I
never figured on anything like this.

54:47.536 --> 54:50.802
I must have hit on heredity. Yep.

54:50.914 --> 54:54.881
That's it. Heredity. Let's see...

54:58.129 --> 55:00.187
Elmer...

55:00.298 --> 55:01.809
Elmer!

55:01.925 --> 55:08.194
If you're not in here in 10 seconds, your
dinner will go to your family: The hogs!

55:08.306 --> 55:09.735
Elm...!

55:09.850 --> 55:12.986
Don't you sneak up on me.

55:13.103 --> 55:21.377
I was just finishing the ironing of
your underthings, Edwina, darling.

55:21.486 --> 55:24.706
Love... Angel...

55:25.740 --> 55:32.342
And all the other nice things I wish I
could think of, so you won't hit...

55:32.455 --> 55:34.844
or yell...

55:34.958 --> 55:37.679
- Honey...
- Honey?!

55:37.794 --> 55:45.060
Don't you "honey" me, you...
you artificial son of a lizard.

55:45.177 --> 55:50.235
Now, sit down, and for
the third time today,

55:50.348 --> 55:55.194
make a slob of yourself
trying to find your mouth.

56:08.825 --> 56:10.336
Idiot!

56:10.452 --> 56:15.214
- Can't you eat with your mouth closed?
- Not until I get something in it, dearest.

56:15.332 --> 56:18.005
What was that?

56:18.126 --> 56:20.847
Nothing, nothing.
It's quite all right.

56:20.962 --> 56:23.814
You're right. You're always right.

56:27.219 --> 56:29.228
My poor Dada.

56:29.638 --> 56:32.110
My poor Dada.

56:43.026 --> 56:46.827
Well, Jennifer, if that's
what's to be then I'll be it.

56:46.947 --> 56:51.625
You know what they say,
Julie-baby: Que sera, sera.

56:54.621 --> 56:57.971
Oh, Jennifer, you know
what I'm thinking?

56:59.668 --> 57:03.219
If this formula were to
fall into the wrong hands,

57:03.338 --> 57:06.641
the consequences could
be devastating.

57:06.758 --> 57:09.527
Now, it's much too
complicated to memorise

57:09.636 --> 57:13.271
and far too vitally
important to destroy.

57:13.390 --> 57:18.615
The only two people that I know
I can trust are my mother...

57:18.728 --> 57:20.868
and my father.

57:20.981 --> 57:23.038
What I should do...

57:24.192 --> 57:27.626
is mail my formula, a copy,

57:28.071 --> 57:30.876
to Mother and Father

57:30.991 --> 57:36.251
with instructions that were
anything to happen to me,

57:36.371 --> 57:42.723
they are to send a copy of the formula
and my original copy to Washington.

57:42.836 --> 57:44.679
George or Martha?

57:44.796 --> 57:46.556
No, Washington D...

57:48.633 --> 57:52.434
You're a silly bird
with a big mouth.

58:34.513 --> 58:37.068
- Professor Kelp...
- Yes?

58:43.730 --> 58:48.207
- I'm ready, Professor.
- That's very... Yeah... What?

58:48.318 --> 58:50.411
Did you forget about my test?

58:51.947 --> 58:54.585
No... er...

58:54.699 --> 58:59.545
Actually, no... I... I'm terribly
sorry... I did... I have it here...

58:59.663 --> 59:04.590
Why don't you sit down at your
table and I'll get your paper.

59:04.709 --> 59:10.314
I actually didn't, er,
really forget. I, er...

59:15.595 --> 59:19.313
I have so many members of the...

59:21.434 --> 59:24.025
class, it's difficult to...

59:28.233 --> 59:31.002
Oh, yes, here we are.

59:32.445 --> 59:35.250
It's very difficult to...

59:37.826 --> 59:40.678
You do want me to take the test?

59:40.787 --> 59:43.176
I'm terribly sorry, Miss Purdy.

59:43.290 --> 59:49.179
Certainly, of course, it's
necessary for you to take it.

59:49.671 --> 59:52.725
- Miss Purdy...
- Yes, Professor?

59:52.841 --> 59:57.733
I was going to say, I sincerely hope
that you don't mind if I don't linger.

59:57.846 --> 01:00:01.196
I have some very essential matters
that I must take care of.

01:00:01.308 --> 01:00:05.737
Certainly, Professor Kelp. And
thank you for understanding.

01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:10.791
I understand far better than you
would ever believe, honey...

01:00:10.901 --> 01:00:14.001
Er, Miss Purdy, that is.

01:00:14.112 --> 01:00:19.503
You just go right on
and thank you for...

01:00:34.424 --> 01:00:37.893
Julius! In the afternoon?

01:00:40.597 --> 01:00:42.275
Hiya, chicky-baby.

01:00:44.184 --> 01:00:46.857
- How's it going?
- Fine.

01:00:47.729 --> 01:00:52.787
Crazy. I thought I'd visit your little
land of learning. Cute. Cute pad.

01:00:52.901 --> 01:00:57.663
What happened to you last night?
What d'you run away like that for?

01:00:57.781 --> 01:01:00.586
I thought you saw a
ghost or something.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.840
Oh, yeah. How about that?

01:01:02.953 --> 01:01:04.962
That's why I stopped by.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.798
I thought I'd lay it on you,
but this ain't the place to talk.

01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:14.972
What do you say we meet later at the
Purple Pit? We could talk better there.

01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:18.191
I don't know. You're pretty weird.
And I don't want...

01:01:18.301 --> 01:01:21.153
- Sh, sh. 10 o'clock?
- Perfect.

01:01:21.263 --> 01:01:23.189
Figures.

01:01:23.306 --> 01:01:26.656
Hey, honey, you look
a little drawn.

01:01:28.395 --> 01:01:35.791
Did you find it a little difficult going
all this time without seeing me? Sh, sh.

01:01:35.902 --> 01:01:37.995
Don't fight it.

01:01:38.113 --> 01:01:45.627
I don't want to hang you up, honey.
I see you're doing your little test here.

01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:49.380
But don't worry, beautiful.
Science'll do fine without you.

01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:54.435
But man needs you the most.
This man. Come here.

01:01:56.131 --> 01:02:01.687
That's good for you. If you
want more, call for refills.

01:02:01.803 --> 01:02:03.397
Later.

01:02:05.307 --> 01:02:06.901
Write nice.

01:02:46.223 --> 01:02:48.861
I just told you the time.
It's still 11.15.

01:02:48.975 --> 01:02:51.910
- Yeah, I know.
- OK, kids.

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.077
You can all relax.

01:02:55.398 --> 01:02:57.621
Watch where you're going, Mac.

01:02:59.402 --> 01:03:03.002
Now that your desperate attempt
at having a good time's flunked,

01:03:03.114 --> 01:03:06.299
have no fear, Buddy's here.

01:03:07.077 --> 01:03:09.253
Let the good times roll.

01:03:09.913 --> 01:03:12.302
Hiya, baby.

01:03:12.415 --> 01:03:14.473
There's my date.

01:03:14.584 --> 01:03:17.009
That sharp-looking chick's my date.

01:03:46.074 --> 01:03:49.875
Cheer up, baby, your prize
package has arrived.

01:03:51.037 --> 01:03:54.304
- Hello, stale ones.
- You're pretty late, Mr Love.

01:03:54.416 --> 01:04:00.519
Hold it, baby, you got it a little mixed up.
You're just way too early, that's all.

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:04.562
Be a nice girl and plant one
over there. You'll feel better.

01:04:04.676 --> 01:04:06.852
Come on, the best things
in life are free.

01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:11.150
And you'll admit, you've got one
of the best things. Lay it on me.

01:04:11.266 --> 01:04:12.741
You're impossible.

01:04:12.851 --> 01:04:16.071
Yeah, well, have some
impossible. Come on.

01:04:21.276 --> 01:04:25.504
See, wasn't that worth waiting for?

01:04:25.614 --> 01:04:28.287
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-UH!

01:04:29.701 --> 01:04:34.178
You gotta admit, I'm not one of
the run-of-the-mill-type creeps

01:04:34.289 --> 01:04:36.797
that hang around this joint, right?

01:04:36.917 --> 01:04:39.223
You got a good thing,
don't louse it up.

01:04:39.336 --> 01:04:44.062
Isn't it enough that you've got
the swingingest and the best?

01:04:44.174 --> 01:04:48.485
You want me to be on time, too?

01:04:48.595 --> 01:04:52.278
- OK, OK, you win.
- Naturally.

01:04:54.476 --> 01:04:59.950
Please tell me why you ran away last
night and left me just sitting there?

01:05:00.065 --> 01:05:05.788
Hey, hey, don't get all riled up.
Cool it! Cool it!

01:05:05.904 --> 01:05:10.713
I don't want to get into no discussions
on an empty stomach anyhow. This is flat.

01:05:12.911 --> 01:05:16.178
Vampira, bring your kit.

01:05:21.628 --> 01:05:23.187
You rang?

01:05:23.296 --> 01:05:26.730
You don't sound exactly too
thrilled to serve the leader.

01:05:26.842 --> 01:05:31.734
On the contrary, I find it a rare
privilege to serve His Royal Lowest.

01:05:31.847 --> 01:05:37.652
You're cute, like a black widow spider.
Shut your mouth and just take the order.

01:05:37.769 --> 01:05:42.330
I've decided I shall not continue
the flight with the fuel I got.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:46.953
So give me a boilermaker,
and heavy on the boil.

01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:50.788
Go on, go on, go on. Come on,
I haven't got all night.

01:05:55.412 --> 01:05:57.054
She's crazy about me also.

01:05:58.456 --> 01:06:03.551
Now, Lost Weekend Junior,
you've ordered your drink.

01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:06.890
About last night. Would you
like to explain what happened?

01:06:07.007 --> 01:06:10.939
I told you I was going
to tell you. It's...

01:06:11.052 --> 01:06:13.726
Why don't we table
it a while, sweetie?

01:06:13.847 --> 01:06:18.858
I mean, all the kids, they're kind
of waiting. It's Dullsville out.

01:06:18.977 --> 01:06:23.288
I'll be back. You take five. And I
love you, baby. Mean it sincerely.

01:06:23.398 --> 01:06:26.071
You wait for me, huh?

01:06:26.193 --> 01:06:30.160
Oh, there you are, sweets.
Thanks a lot.

01:06:38.288 --> 01:06:40.012
Sickening, isn't he?

01:06:41.166 --> 01:06:44.302
But... he's got something.

01:06:45.462 --> 01:06:49.476
And I mean to find out what it is.

01:06:50.342 --> 01:06:52.814
I think I'll do...

01:06:53.970 --> 01:07:00.322
do a tune that I'm going to
record for Poverty Records.

01:07:01.269 --> 01:07:04.204
They're the only
ones who'll have me.

Later, Stella. Wait...

- What time is it?
- I think he's getting his watch fixed.

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:42.917
- Think he had an accident?
- Where is he?

01:08:43.037 --> 01:08:46.506
- Ten to one he doesn't show.

01:13:06.009 --> 01:13:09.644
Yes, Dr Warfield would
appreciate it very much.

01:13:09.763 --> 01:13:11.238
Can I go right in?

01:13:12.974 --> 01:13:17.617
The faculty is always ready to
serve the needs of the students.

01:13:17.729 --> 01:13:23.832
- I'm terribly sorry I'm late, Dr Warfield.
- Any time, Miss Purdy, any time at all.

01:13:23.944 --> 01:13:25.372
Thank you.

01:13:26.404 --> 01:13:30.288
Therefore, the success
or failure of the prom

01:13:30.408 --> 01:13:35.503
rests on your shoulders as members
of the Entertainment Committee.

01:13:35.622 --> 01:13:40.717
Miss Lemmon, will you send in the
proposed list of the entertainments.

01:13:43.129 --> 01:13:48.271
Good, good, "The Lightlighters".
Wonderful... Love folk singers.

Good, good, perfect.

01:14:00.272 --> 01:14:02.578
I thought they'd split up.

Who's this "Buddy Love"?
What's a Buddy Love?

01:14:07.737 --> 01:14:11.041
He's a local boy.
He's just terrific.

01:14:11.157 --> 01:14:13.831
- He's our new leader.
- Leader?

01:14:13.952 --> 01:14:17.717
- He's, like, too much.
- Like too much what?

01:14:17.831 --> 01:14:21.549
He's one of the truly great
swingers of all time.

Swingers... Swingers of all time...

01:14:26.047 --> 01:14:28.769
It seems that you students
know Mr Love quite well.

01:14:28.884 --> 01:14:33.195
What about the faculty members?
Anyone here familiar with Mr Love?

01:14:33.305 --> 01:14:37.105
- Oh, he's the greatest.
- Do you know Mr Love?

01:14:37.225 --> 01:14:38.784
Oh... Me?

01:14:38.894 --> 01:14:43.241
No... I meant... Well, I heard
all the other students...

01:14:43.356 --> 01:14:47.075
- Professor Kelp, I heard that myself.
- Yes, you did.

01:14:47.194 --> 01:14:49.831
Anyone here know Mr Love?

01:14:51.156 --> 01:14:55.419
Very well, in that case, I
will have to meet him myself.

01:14:55.535 --> 01:14:58.636
Have him come to my
office at three o'clock.

01:14:58.747 --> 01:15:05.051
Dr Warfield, we don't exactly know
how to get in touch with Mr Love,

01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:07.179
on such short notice, that is.

01:15:07.297 --> 01:15:12.438
What do you mean? Is he some
kind of roving bum or something?

01:15:12.552 --> 01:15:16.946
- I've never heard of such a thing.
- I might see him tonight.

01:15:17.057 --> 01:15:21.866
That's not good enough. I want
to see him today at three.

01:15:21.978 --> 01:15:25.245
I beg your pardon,
Dr Warfield, but I...

01:15:25.357 --> 01:15:32.290
I just might be able to see my way clear,
possibly, to contact this Mr... Love.

01:15:33.281 --> 01:15:36.133
Professor Kelp, I don't
care who contacts him.

01:15:36.243 --> 01:15:40.803
Just get him here by three o'clock
today or forget the whole thing.

01:15:40.914 --> 01:15:42.342
Meeting dismissed.

01:16:12.737 --> 01:16:15.922
- Where's your pad?
- About a mile from campus.

01:16:16.032 --> 01:16:20.878
I have bought the craziest new drapes...
You mean my dictation pad.

01:16:20.996 --> 01:16:24.880
- Sorry, I'll get it immediately.
- Never mind. What did you want?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.307
Mr Love is waiting outside to
see you and he's a gasser...

01:16:30.422 --> 01:16:32.561
I mean, shall I ask him to come in?

01:16:32.674 --> 01:16:37.187
- If you can do so without fainting.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:54.112 --> 01:16:57.415
You gonna make that
your life's work, baby?

01:16:57.532 --> 01:16:59.506
Hey, here.

01:17:02.370 --> 01:17:04.463
Mr Love?

01:17:04.581 --> 01:17:08.132
Buddy to you. What's your moniker?
What do they call you?

01:17:08.251 --> 01:17:11.934
Mortimer, Harvey, Norman,
Homer? Which is it?

01:17:12.422 --> 01:17:14.598
You may call me Dr
Warfield, young man.

01:17:14.716 --> 01:17:16.559
OK, Doc it is.

01:17:16.676 --> 01:17:20.774
What kinda doctor are you, sweetie?
Sawbones, is that the idea?

01:17:20.889 --> 01:17:24.156
Or a headshrinker? I went
to them once, you dig?

01:17:24.267 --> 01:17:28.828
Headshrinker. Told me I had a dual
personality, split, schizo and all that jazz.

01:17:28.939 --> 01:17:33.866
He charges me $82, so I give him $41 and
say get the rest from the other guy.

01:17:38.532 --> 01:17:40.090
What's eating you?

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:47.014
Mr Love, I sent for you in
regard to the senior prom.

01:17:47.749 --> 01:17:50.803
However, after seeing
you, my door...

01:17:50.919 --> 01:17:57.816
Would you think I was terribly rude if
I asked you the name of your tailor?

01:17:57.926 --> 01:18:02.735
- That's wild. Absolutely gorgeous.
- Oh, you mean this?

01:18:02.848 --> 01:18:07.028
- Just beautiful.
- Actually, it's just a ready-made suit.

01:18:07.143 --> 01:18:08.654
You're kidding?

01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:14.077
Well, sort of a handmade-to-order
ready-made suit off the rack.

01:18:14.192 --> 01:18:17.542
Just magnificent. I think you're modest.
Is that the picture, sweetie?

01:18:17.654 --> 01:18:22.131
You've got the perfect physique and
anything you put on swings, right?

01:18:22.242 --> 01:18:24.251
Ever consider going
into show business?

01:18:24.369 --> 01:18:26.462
- I did a few school plays...
- Nutty...

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:29.680
Girls backstage mob you, swamp you?
Is that the picture?

01:18:29.791 --> 01:18:33.723
- Stay there, don't move.
- You might say that in my time...

01:18:33.837 --> 01:18:35.680
Sorry, Doc. You all right?

01:18:35.797 --> 01:18:39.064
Did you really do a
job in show business?

01:18:39.176 --> 01:18:42.027
Anyone ever say you got
a Cary Grant-ish look?

01:18:42.137 --> 01:18:44.562
Ever see him walk towards a girl?

01:18:44.681 --> 01:18:49.242
Try that walk. Let me see, I'm just
curious. Walk like Cary Grant. Beautiful.

01:18:49.352 --> 01:18:52.287
Beautiful. Sure you're doing
the right thing working here?

01:18:52.397 --> 01:18:54.240
What did you do? Shakespeare?

01:18:54.357 --> 01:18:56.035
- I knew it... Hamlet...
- Hamlet...

01:18:56.151 --> 01:18:58.576
- Would you do it?
- Mr Love, it's been so long...

01:18:58.695 --> 01:19:03.457
Would you do it for me, Doctor?
Come on, baby. It's gotta be wild.

01:19:04.117 --> 01:19:07.052
- Go ahead.
- Let's see...

01:19:07.162 --> 01:19:09.800
- To be...
- Hold it! Do it right.

01:19:09.915 --> 01:19:12.422
Get on the stage. Let
me be your audience.

01:19:12.542 --> 01:19:16.510
- The faculty...!
- It's the best thing in the world for you.

01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:19.221
- Get up there and perform.
- If you insist...

01:19:19.341 --> 01:19:22.192
- Let it out.
- To be, or...

01:19:22.302 --> 01:19:26.613
Hold it. Let's make it a stage.
Let's make it right.

01:19:26.723 --> 01:19:31.366
You're gonna be beautiful,
just beautiful. Lay it on me.

01:19:31.478 --> 01:19:33.155
Am I in the light?

01:19:33.271 --> 01:19:35.660
- To be, or not...
- Hold it! Do it right.

01:19:35.774 --> 01:19:40.085
Be in show business. Hamlet, right?
You gotta play it all the way.

01:19:40.195 --> 01:19:44.838
Hamlet... Here, put it on. It's
gonna make you feel beautiful.

01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:47.920
- I feel it already.
- You'll play it like it's never been played.

01:19:48.912 --> 01:19:54.137
- Go on. Let it out. Enjoy it.
- It's a difference...

01:19:54.251 --> 01:19:56.924
- To be, or...
- Hold it. Do it right. Hamlet?

01:19:57.045 --> 01:20:00.680
A prince? You gotta go all
the way with the sword.

01:20:00.799 --> 01:20:04.066
You dig Hamlet. Do it.
Enjoy it. It's beautiful.

01:20:04.177 --> 01:20:07.397
Beautiful. You've wasted your
life with this school jazz.

01:20:07.514 --> 01:20:11.113
Well, I've often thought
of chucking it all...

01:20:11.226 --> 01:20:13.734
- To be, or...
- Hold it.

01:20:13.854 --> 01:20:16.195
Royalty is one thing, a crown.

01:20:16.314 --> 01:20:19.332
Do it right. Hamlet. Do it right.

01:20:19.442 --> 01:20:22.247
- Have the crown. Be Hamlet.
- My hat...!

01:20:22.696 --> 01:20:26.745
It's the way it should be.
You've got the crown.

01:20:26.867 --> 01:20:31.178
- I think I have it.
- Do Hamlet and really let it out.

01:20:31.288 --> 01:20:33.843
You're beautiful.

01:20:33.957 --> 01:20:37.640
To be, or not to be;
that is the question:

01:20:37.752 --> 01:20:40.225
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer

01:20:40.338 --> 01:20:44.187
The slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune...

01:20:44.301 --> 01:20:48.101
- Oh, beautiful. Doctor, you choked me.
- I'm not through...

01:20:48.221 --> 01:20:53.279
You choked me. It was gorgeous.
The prettiest thing I've ever seen.

01:20:53.393 --> 01:20:55.569
- See you at the prom, Doc?
- Oh, yes.

01:20:55.687 --> 01:20:58.456
- Behind the footlights?
- We'll have you there...

01:20:58.565 --> 01:21:03.457
- I knew it, baby. You're beautiful.
- Carry on the great tradition of theatre.

01:21:03.570 --> 01:21:08.248
- Practise that Shakespeare.
- At the prom, Mr Love.

01:21:09.659 --> 01:21:14.255
To be, or not to be;
that is the question...

01:21:42.234 --> 01:21:44.907
Jennifer, what am I
to do, Jennifer?

01:21:45.028 --> 01:21:50.751
Have you ever thought of taking poison?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, Julius, taking poison!

01:24:18.723 --> 01:24:20.615
Hi... Doctor.

01:24:21.893 --> 01:24:24.615
- Kelp.
- Yes, sir?

01:24:24.729 --> 01:24:28.993
- Do you mind?
- Not at all. Do you lead?

01:24:29.109 --> 01:24:31.664
I'm sorry. I did misunderstand.

01:24:31.778 --> 01:24:37.667
I get carried away, what with the music.
It was a toe-tapper, I must admit.

01:24:37.784 --> 01:24:43.341
It's rare to hear instrumentation these
days, what with folk singers, etc...

01:24:43.456 --> 01:24:46.593
Would you care for some
refreshment, Miss Lemmon?

01:24:46.710 --> 01:24:52.052
Thank you, I think I would, but let
me go. You don't have to bother.

01:24:52.174 --> 01:24:55.773
There's no bother.
It would be my pleasure.

01:24:55.886 --> 01:24:59.520
- Kelp...
- Yes, I'll have a lemonade, too.

01:24:59.639 --> 01:25:03.689
- Kelp, will you get us two lemonades?
- I'm terribly sorry, Doctor.

01:25:03.810 --> 01:25:08.905
I was again so terribly distressed
at that wonderful toe-tapper.

01:25:09.024 --> 01:25:11.330
Well, zip and I'm gone.

01:25:33.882 --> 01:25:35.560
Hi, Professor.

01:25:35.675 --> 01:25:37.649
- Oh, Stell.
- Stell?

01:25:37.761 --> 01:25:40.945
That is, Miss Purdy... I'm sorry.

01:25:41.056 --> 01:25:45.616
How are you? Are you
having a good time, dear?

01:25:45.727 --> 01:25:48.283
I'm having a good time, but...

01:25:48.396 --> 01:25:54.250
I'd have a much better time if
somebody would ask me to dance.

01:26:03.495 --> 01:26:06.168
Cat got your tongue, Professor?

01:26:06.289 --> 01:26:10.683
No, the punch bowl has my arm.

01:26:12.003 --> 01:26:14.677
- I didn't realise...
- Let me help you.

01:26:14.798 --> 01:26:19.275
Thank you. I guess I'm
just accident prone.

01:26:19.386 --> 01:26:22.321
- Don't worry about it.
- I won't.

01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:28.236
- Come on, let's dance.
- Oh, yes, all right. Let me leave that.

01:26:28.353 --> 01:26:31.288
That sounds like a splendid idea.

01:27:01.428 --> 01:27:06.106
I neglected to mention, Miss Purdy, you're
looking very beautiful this evening.

01:27:06.224 --> 01:27:09.444
You must be looking forward to
seeing your Buddy Love tonight.

01:27:09.561 --> 01:27:14.239
- How did you know that?
- Everyone knows he's appearing tonight.

01:27:14.357 --> 01:27:20.128
Oh... Here. I guess I'm looking
forward to seeing him.

01:27:20.238 --> 01:27:22.876
But I can't figure out why.

01:27:24.409 --> 01:27:28.092
Well, he is quite
good-looking, is he not?

01:27:28.205 --> 01:27:32.468
Oh, yes, he is, but that
means nothing to me.

01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:40.014
He... I'm told he is a young man
with a very nice personality.

01:27:41.927 --> 01:27:48.943
On the contrary, he's rude, disrespectful,
self-centred and discourteous.

01:27:49.059 --> 01:27:51.650
Then it's not his nice personality.

01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:53.613
Hardly.

01:27:53.730 --> 01:27:56.155
I'm told that he's quite
talented, though.

01:27:56.858 --> 01:28:02.545
Oh, yes, he's very talented.
But talent comes in many forms.

01:28:02.656 --> 01:28:06.338
I believe intelligence is a
greater talent than anything.

01:28:07.035 --> 01:28:14.098
If Buddy has any real intelligence, he has
a fantastic talent for keeping it hidden.

01:28:14.209 --> 01:28:17.559
I see, well, then,
evidently, Miss Purdy,

01:28:17.671 --> 01:28:22.646
whatever you see in this young
man it must be very well buried.

01:28:24.219 --> 01:28:26.442
I think you're getting warm.

01:28:26.555 --> 01:28:30.439
Well, then, perhaps, and
it's just a possibility,

01:28:30.559 --> 01:28:36.495
he chooses to keep the inner man
locked up so that no one steps on him.

01:28:37.899 --> 01:28:42.044
But he should know I don't
want to step on him.

01:28:42.153 --> 01:28:45.539
Maybe someday I'll get
to prove it to him.

01:28:45.657 --> 01:28:50.466
If he ever unlocks that inner
man and lets him loose,

01:28:50.579 --> 01:28:53.549
so that I can grab
him and hold him.

01:28:53.665 --> 01:28:56.682
- I appreciate it.
- What?

01:28:56.793 --> 01:28:59.514
That... What I meant
was, that's very nice.

01:29:14.352 --> 01:29:18.367
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
It's show time. Gather round!

01:29:18.481 --> 01:29:20.907
We'll get the show on the road.

01:29:21.026 --> 01:29:25.455
Before we go on, I'd like you to
meet some of the specialists:

01:29:25.572 --> 01:29:28.922
There's Butch Stone up
there, you remember Butch.

01:29:31.411 --> 01:29:33.468
My kid brother, Stumpy Brown.

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:37.345
Stumpy not only plays the
trombone, but also sings.

01:29:37.459 --> 01:29:41.259
Butch Stone is known for 'A
Good Man is Hard to Find'.

01:29:41.379 --> 01:29:45.062
We've a great show lined up
for you, a few surprises...

01:29:45.175 --> 01:29:48.858
Why do men keep
running away from me?

01:30:11.535 --> 01:30:13.259
The formula...

01:30:17.165 --> 01:30:19.472
- Jennifer!
- Hi, there.

01:30:19.584 --> 01:30:21.262
Jennifer.

01:30:29.845 --> 01:30:32.352
My formula.

01:30:34.975 --> 01:30:36.818
Th-Th-The formula.

01:30:37.602 --> 01:30:42.281
Jennifer, you've eaten
all of my formula.

01:30:43.608 --> 01:30:47.955
- Excuse me.
- Oh, shut up, you stupid bird!

01:30:48.071 --> 01:30:51.172
Then I can't suggest you
call your mother and father

01:30:51.283 --> 01:30:55.380
and get them to read the formula
from the copy you sent...

01:30:55.495 --> 01:30:59.723
Oh, what a wonderful bird!
Where's the phone?

01:31:03.086 --> 01:31:07.647
Long distance will be area code...
Oh, yes, area code...

01:31:07.757 --> 01:31:11.558
Sp... Sp... Splendid
idea, Jennifer.

01:31:14.764 --> 01:31:17.652
H... Hello, Father.

01:31:18.935 --> 01:31:22.120
Hello... I say, hello, Father.

01:31:22.230 --> 01:31:24.655
This is Julius. Yeah, I...

01:31:24.774 --> 01:31:27.828
Julius... J... Yes, your son.

01:31:27.944 --> 01:31:30.370
Would you be good enough, Dad,

01:31:30.488 --> 01:31:36.841
to open the formula for me and read
it to me so I can mark it down.

01:31:36.953 --> 01:31:40.303
Yes, I certainly... Actually,
I'd appreciate it, yes...

01:31:47.422 --> 01:31:50.357
It's just going to
have to be enough.

01:32:23.208 --> 01:32:27.970
Where can he be? I hope nothing's
happened to prevent his getting here.

01:32:28.088 --> 01:32:30.857
He better get here or
there'll be a riot.

01:32:43.895 --> 01:32:47.530
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:32:47.649 --> 01:32:50.240
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing the next performer

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:53.378
is one of the easiest
chores I've ever had.

01:32:53.488 --> 01:32:57.123
Simply because this card I'm
holding is the announcement

01:32:57.242 --> 01:33:01.174
that the performer wants
read exactly as written.

01:33:01.288 --> 01:33:03.464
Makes it easy.

01:33:03.582 --> 01:33:08.924
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting
the world's greatest everything.

01:33:09.045 --> 01:33:12.182
The best dressed, the
swingingest performer,

01:33:12.299 --> 01:33:16.527
and one of the nicest
guys in the whole world.

01:33:16.636 --> 01:33:21.030
Here he is, the 1963 senior
prom's answer to Don Juan,

01:33:21.141 --> 01:33:22.984
Mr Buddy Love.

You're very wise.

01:35:47.829 --> 01:35:51.263
If you'll hold it a second,
I'll thrill you some more.

01:35:51.374 --> 01:35:56.350
I'd like to do a tune for you that's
been a favourite of the gang at the...

01:35:56.463 --> 01:35:59.932
you should pardon the expression,
Dr Warfield... Purple Pit.

01:36:03.845 --> 01:36:08.737

I, er...

01:37:08.201 --> 01:37:12.714
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm not usually at...

01:37:15.041 --> 01:37:20.218
I'm not usually at
a loss for words,

01:37:20.338 --> 01:37:22.478
but if you'll just...

01:37:23.633 --> 01:37:26.307
bear with me a moment, I think
I might be able to explain.

01:37:31.266 --> 01:37:35.280
It happened some time ago...

01:37:35.395 --> 01:37:40.406
being a scientist, I just
happened to have stumbled on

01:37:41.902 --> 01:37:45.620
one of the curious
mysteries of science.

01:37:47.199 --> 01:37:50.050
I found myself...

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:57.223
so curious that I was
unable to just stop.

01:37:57.334 --> 01:38:00.138
Nonetheless...

01:38:00.253 --> 01:38:04.398
I never really knew what
was going to prevail.

01:38:05.759 --> 01:38:12.692
I do know now that I should've
left it alone... actually.

01:38:13.642 --> 01:38:15.366
But...

01:38:17.103 --> 01:38:19.825
it is a very, very
hard thing to do,

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:28.585
particularly when you've found that
you've been able to do something

01:38:28.698 --> 01:38:32.499
that so many others failed to do.

01:38:34.079 --> 01:38:35.507
Therefore...

01:38:42.963 --> 01:38:49.516
Actually, I have no real
defence for my actions,

01:38:49.636 --> 01:38:51.978
other than...

01:38:52.097 --> 01:38:58.615
I had no control over what I
said or did as Buddy Love.

01:39:17.706 --> 01:39:19.929
I can only say...

01:39:24.004 --> 01:39:26.559
I hope...

01:39:26.673 --> 01:39:29.181
I hope I haven't hurt anyone...

01:39:29.301 --> 01:39:31.025
hurt anyone.

01:39:32.971 --> 01:39:35.111
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

01:39:35.223 --> 01:39:38.028
I didn't mean to do...

01:39:38.143 --> 01:39:41.778
anything that wasn't
of a kind nature.

01:39:46.401 --> 01:39:50.415
Learning a lesson in life is...

01:39:50.530 --> 01:39:53.631
is never...

01:39:53.742 --> 01:39:57.460
is never really too late.

01:39:58.872 --> 01:40:02.590
And I think that the...

01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:06.807
the lesson that I learned
came just in time.

01:40:10.091 --> 01:40:13.192
I don't want to...

01:40:13.303 --> 01:40:16.902
I don't want to be
something that I'm not.

01:40:17.015 --> 01:40:19.440
I didn't like being someone else.

01:40:21.019 --> 01:40:24.535
At the same time,
I'm very glad I was.

01:40:26.274 --> 01:40:30.039
'Cause I found out something
that I never knew.

01:40:34.908 --> 01:40:37.416
You might as well like yourself.

01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:44.130
Just think about all the time you're
going to have to spend with you.

01:40:44.251 --> 01:40:45.845
And...

01:40:48.755 --> 01:40:50.184
Well...

01:40:55.095 --> 01:40:58.646
If you don't think much of
yourself, how can others?

01:40:58.765 --> 01:41:01.700
That's what I found out.

01:41:20.203 --> 01:41:24.301
Dr Warfield, I'm very sorry and...

01:41:26.418 --> 01:41:29.684
I like it here at the
university very much.

01:41:29.796 --> 01:41:32.814
I hope that...

01:41:32.924 --> 01:41:39.193
I hope that after you hear the facts, you
won't think too terribly wrong of me.

01:41:39.306 --> 01:41:42.940
I love everybody here and I...

01:41:43.059 --> 01:41:48.201
I wouldn't really like
to leave... actually.

01:42:32.275 --> 01:42:35.709
Can I be of any
assistance, Professor?

01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:45.426
No, thank you very much. I'll...

01:42:45.539 --> 01:42:51.724
I'll have to just try and work
this out myself, thank you.

01:42:51.837 --> 01:42:56.563
Well, there's really nothing
to work out, Professor,

01:42:56.675 --> 01:43:00.903
other than understand that

01:43:01.012 --> 01:43:07.731
just being one person is more than
enough for any human being to handle.

01:43:10.021 --> 01:43:13.039
Do you mean that...

01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:17.828
- Well, you have to understand that...
- Sh!

01:43:17.946 --> 01:43:24.843
I'm only trying to say that I'd never want
to spend my life with anyone like Buddy.

01:43:27.622 --> 01:43:33.926
Being the wife of a professor
would be much more normal and...

01:43:34.045 --> 01:43:36.185
much happier.

01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:42.319
Oh, Stella!

01:43:44.723 --> 01:43:49.235
See, I... I told you
I'm accident prone.

01:44:09.539 --> 01:44:11.299
That's actually...

01:44:12.542 --> 01:44:17.470
"The psychological properties
of visual quality and quantity

01:44:17.589 --> 01:44:23.810
"can be represented conveniently
by a three-dimensional diagram.

01:44:23.929 --> 01:44:28.109
Three-dimensional diagram,
right. Oddly enough...

01:44:28.225 --> 01:44:31.990
Thanks, sonny. Thanks for
telling us where our kid works.

01:44:32.103 --> 01:44:36.248
Not so loud, Elmer, dear.
Loud? Who the devil's loud?

01:44:36.358 --> 01:44:40.076
Oh-oh! Whoah-oh!

01:44:41.446 --> 01:44:44.547
Marge, Marge, Marge, Marge.

01:44:44.866 --> 01:44:49.046
Hey, class, how are you?
Good to be amongst.

01:44:51.831 --> 01:44:54.090
Well, well...

01:44:55.836 --> 01:45:01.606
If it isn't the square bookworm
we laughingly referred to as our son.

01:45:02.968 --> 01:45:05.559
Here, bookworm, have a cigar.

01:45:05.679 --> 01:45:10.108
Go ahead, go on. Pure Havana,
straight from Havana, yeah.

01:45:10.225 --> 01:45:15.699
Cost us $6 million ransom.
Pretty good, huh?

01:45:16.273 --> 01:45:18.828
Good to see you again, Julius.

01:45:18.942 --> 01:45:21.913
Mush and hush. Mouth,
mouth, hush, mush.

01:45:22.028 --> 01:45:26.375
Here, now, back, back.
Hush. Nothing.

01:45:27.826 --> 01:45:33.596
Here it is, kids. Are you tired of being
a square? Tired of a dull existence?

01:45:33.707 --> 01:45:37.507
Well, for one dollar, the
tenth part of a sawbuck,

01:45:37.627 --> 01:45:39.969
try Kelp's Kool Tonic.

01:45:40.088 --> 01:45:42.940
You, too, can be the
life of the party.

01:45:43.049 --> 01:45:44.809
He's right, kids, it's a gasser.

01:45:44.926 --> 01:45:48.775
Step right up, folks.
Be somebody, be anybody.

01:45:50.807 --> 01:45:54.276
- Sixteen bottles, look, here.
- Five...

01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.573
Wait, wait, wait, Stella.

01:45:59.691 --> 01:46:02.364
Wait, sweetheart, what have I done?

01:46:02.485 --> 01:46:04.662
What has he done? What will I do?

01:46:04.779 --> 01:46:08.462
I know what you'll do.
Do you have the licence?

01:46:08.575 --> 01:46:11.925
- Yes, here it is, dear.
- What are we waiting for?

01:46:12.037 --> 01:46:16.086
What about the formula, what
about Mother, what about Father?

01:46:16.208 --> 01:46:20.436
What's done is done. And we
have our own lives to live.

01:46:20.545 --> 01:46:22.934
Come on, let's go.

01:46:24.466 --> 01:46:29.809
Yes, actually, Stella, what's
right is right, let's split.
