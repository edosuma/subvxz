00:14.970 --> 00:16.756
[engine running]

00:41.700 --> 00:43.327
[Darlene] You know what
that is right there?

00:43.960 --> 00:45.450
That is plug-ugly.

00:46.540 --> 00:49.623
This was a place of great natural beauty.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.298
Birds used to nest
in those trees, Jacob...

00:53.380 --> 00:57.965
herons, egrets, cranes.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.301
[scoffs]

01:00.390 --> 01:04.679
It's our wonder of the worldturning
into a resort.

01:06.060 --> 01:09.803
-It's ugly, I know.
-It's a desecration.

01:10.940 --> 01:15.149
[sighs] That riverboat
they're bringing up here,

01:15.950 --> 01:18.771
have you seen it? I mean, close-up?

01:20.240 --> 01:22.617
[sighs] 'Cause we're gonna be seeing it
on our morning walks

01:22.700 --> 01:24.577
every day for the rest of our lives.

01:26.410 --> 01:31.586
I'm reminding you that ill humor in
the morning brings about a darkened day.

01:36.970 --> 01:39.962
How is this any different
from the power company

01:40.050 --> 01:42.678
flooding out our forebears
a hundred years ago?

01:42.760 --> 01:45.172
We entered into it by choice.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.555
We did, Darlene.

01:49.150 --> 01:52.938
Not without reservation,
but for the benefit of the family.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.897
And our family will benefit.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.026
-The family?
-Uh-huh.

01:58.110 --> 01:59.407
What family?

02:56.050 --> 02:57.256
Go get Petty.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.619
[sniffs]

03:00.720 --> 03:03.507
[Marty] We're not under arrest
because we don't have anything to hide.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.386
[Charlotte] Then why are we huddled
like a football team?

03:05.470 --> 03:06.755
[Wendy] This is not a joke, Charlotte.

03:08.310 --> 03:09.766
[Jonah] When can we go back inside?

03:11.020 --> 03:14.012
Uh, I think you guys can go back inside
when they're finished.

03:33.370 --> 03:34.826
[inaudible]

03:55.100 --> 03:56.761
[Jacob] Busy morning looks like.

03:58.230 --> 03:59.561
Not a thing to worry about.

04:01.150 --> 04:04.904
This is Jonah's,
just back from the taxiderm.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.867
What the hell's that?

04:09.330 --> 04:10.615
Boy's first kill.

04:16.540 --> 04:17.620
You ready?

04:22.800 --> 04:25.428
-Call that lawyer. Have him meet me there?
-Mm-hmm.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.288
Yeah, I don't, uh, feel comfortable,
you going through the safe like that.

04:50.370 --> 04:52.611
Well, ifI cared any less, I'd be dead.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.127
What?

04:58.210 --> 05:00.747
Well, what are you, uh...
What are you doing?

05:02.340 --> 05:03.830
Making sure, for Marty's sake,

05:03.920 --> 05:05.876
that there's nothin' here
that shouldn't be.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.676
[stammers] Wait. Wait. Was Marty arrested?

05:10.180 --> 05:14.674
I told you. I don't know.
All's I know is they raided his house.

05:14.770 --> 05:17.147
Okay, but he wasn't arrested, right?

05:17.230 --> 05:21.974
Are you thinking that I know more
than I did five seconds ago?

05:22.070 --> 05:23.355
Wait, you don't think they would come...

05:23.440 --> 05:24.850
They wouldn't arrest us, would they?

05:24.940 --> 05:28.068
Why? You got child pornography
on your computer or something?

05:28.160 --> 05:30.025
-[scoffs]
-Okay, that's not funny.

05:30.120 --> 05:30.984
[Ruth chuckles]

05:31.950 --> 05:36.205
Not to you.
But that's the thing about being funny.

05:36.710 --> 05:38.280
They would need a warrant, wouldn't they?

05:38.370 --> 05:41.168
Yeah, yeah, they would need that, um...

05:41.250 --> 05:43.298
-What do you call it?
-Probable cause?

05:43.380 --> 05:46.087
Yeah, exactly. And they don't have that.

05:46.170 --> 05:48.377
I mean, well, not in my case--

05:48.470 --> 05:52.759
Can you shut the fuck up and get me
a cardboard box behind the bar?

05:53.600 --> 05:55.010
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

05:55.770 --> 05:58.056
-[Jade] What's going on in here?
-[Sam] Nothin'.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.971
Doesn't look like nothin'.

06:02.150 --> 06:05.779
Just, uh, keep an eye on her, okay?
I'm gonna be right back.

06:14.870 --> 06:16.076
What are you doing in the safe?

06:16.660 --> 06:18.958
Looking for the ham sandwich I left.

06:25.590 --> 06:30.129
Can you do me a favor and get the fuck out
and close the door?

06:31.340 --> 06:34.059
I take my orders from Sam.

06:35.390 --> 06:37.767
-Oh, is that right? Well...
-Mm-hmm.

06:40.980 --> 06:44.689
Well, how 'bout I pop those tits
and squeeze out the silicone?

06:44.770 --> 06:46.772
-How do you feel about that?
-[gasp51

06:54.580 --> 06:57.743
I've got you, Marty. It's over.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.492
The cartel knows where you are.
They're waiting to just kill you.

07:03.460 --> 07:06.293
But here, it's safe.

07:07.380 --> 07:08.836
Your family is safe.

07:09.340 --> 07:10.500
Agents are at the house right now,

07:10.590 --> 07:13.297
ready to take Wendy and the kids
right into protective custody.

07:15.010 --> 07:18.969
L/fe...
50 they say

07:19.680 --> 07:23.093
[5 but a game
And they let it 5//,'0 away

07:27.110 --> 07:30.273
If I were you,
I'd just really think it through,

07:30.360 --> 07:34.865
because we may never pass this way again.

07:38.660 --> 07:39.945
[knock on door]

07:45.630 --> 07:47.586
What's up? Great, send her in.

07:47.670 --> 07:48.659
Your lawyer's here.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.846
[Petty scoffs]

08:00.430 --> 08:02.136
Not the lavwer you were expecting?

08:03.310 --> 08:06.359
Marty here was just inquiring
about his future as a paid informant

08:06.440 --> 08:08.567
for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

08:09.190 --> 08:10.930
No, I wasn't.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.440
[Wendy]
Did you steal $5, 000?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.111
I didn't steal it. I took it,

08:22.210 --> 08:24.030
because just in case you and Dad
have an emergency or--

08:24.120 --> 08:26.122
Is that all you stole? What about Jonah?

08:26.210 --> 08:28.030
He doesn't know anything. I swear.

08:29.420 --> 08:31.547
-What did you buy?
-What?

08:32.050 --> 08:34.462
They found $4,600.
So, what did you buy with the rest?

08:34.550 --> 08:36.040
Um...

08:37.220 --> 08:39.051
Jeans and a sweater
and other little things--

08:39.140 --> 08:40.516
Mm-hmm. In case of emergency, huh?

08:40.600 --> 08:41.840
You got any other surprises for me?

08:41.930 --> 08:42.976
-Anything you wanna tell me?
-Mnh-mnh.

08:43.060 --> 08:46.188
You know, I distinctly remember you saying
to me that everything,

08:46.270 --> 08:48.932
everything that's happened was making you
feel like you were growing up too fast.

08:49.020 --> 08:53.855
Well, grow the fuck up,
because it's game on. Do you understand?

08:56.860 --> 09:00.614
Let's just cut straight to it, shall we?
And bring your attorney up to speed here.

09:00.700 --> 09:04.864
The fact is, Marty, you are really good
at creating corporate structures.

09:05.790 --> 09:08.372
But the problem is,
you lack people skills.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.621
Misjudgment of character.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.122
I mean, it's your Achilles' heel.

09:15.220 --> 09:18.633
[scoffs] I mean, I don't wanna talk out
of school here, but...

09:20.850 --> 09:23.341
Just look at your track record, you know?

09:23.430 --> 09:24.670
Hmm?

09:25.980 --> 09:27.186
Dead. [sighs]

09:30.360 --> 09:31.816
[sniffs] Dead.

09:33.150 --> 09:37.769
Oh, Bruce Liddell,
your longtime business partner and friend.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.236
[scoffs] He became an informant for us.

09:41.950 --> 09:44.828
I mean, he turned on you, buddy...
I mean, like that.

09:45.750 --> 09:48.787
That has to hurt. [exhales]

09:50.540 --> 09:54.544
And now your daughter,
she takes five grand of cartel money,

09:54.630 --> 09:57.872
stashes it away in a lunch box
reeking of pot, by the way...

10:00.390 --> 10:04.349
I'm sure you know how the cartel reacts
when the value of an operative plummets.

10:04.930 --> 10:06.978
Or if their loyalty's ever in question.

10:08.940 --> 10:11.056
I guess my question is...

10:13.770 --> 10:14.976
[sighs]

10:16.280 --> 10:17.690
do you think you're safe?

10:19.490 --> 10:20.946
Your poor kids, Marty.

10:21.780 --> 10:24.328
They were so scared this morning,
but not surprised,

10:24.410 --> 10:25.479
because they're complicit.

10:25.580 --> 10:27.457
And they're starting to crack.
You know it.

10:28.330 --> 10:31.709
I'm sure you also know that
we try kids as adults all the time now.

10:32.540 --> 10:35.293
Good God, could you imagine Jonah
in prison for 25 years?

10:35.380 --> 10:37.757
He'd get out, what, be 38 years old?

10:37.840 --> 10:39.796
Will you be charging my client?

10:39.880 --> 10:41.256
If not, we've heard enough.

10:42.510 --> 10:45.673
People skills, Marty. Judgment.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.670
Your bosses, they need to trust you

10:47.770 --> 10:50.512
to keep this all together
so it doesn't all topple over.

10:50.600 --> 10:57.529
And yet Ruth Langmore, right,
your teenage lieutenant...

10:59.360 --> 11:00.850
Did you know she tried to kill you?

11:02.740 --> 11:06.824
Remember when she gave you
a ride home on her boat? August?

11:07.660 --> 11:09.457
Your dock was wired, Marty,

11:09.960 --> 11:13.077
exact same way the Blue Cat clock
was wired when Ruth killed her uncles.

11:13.170 --> 11:14.990
I'm sure you know about that also.

11:16.130 --> 11:19.338
I never really did get to know Boyd,
but I did get to know Russ.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.753
Russ told me quite a bit about what you
and Ruth do to help out the cartel.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.502
We both know that if you could
substantiate those charges,

11:26.600 --> 11:28.215
you would have arrested her.

11:28.310 --> 11:32.098
I know Ruth wired the dock
because I unwired it.

11:33.940 --> 11:35.680
I saved your life, Marty.

11:36.940 --> 11:38.521
Part of the job, I guess.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.237
Can I get you a bottle of water?

11:42.820 --> 11:46.074
You were never supposed
to walk out of the boathouse that day.

11:47.280 --> 11:51.068
And if you don't believe me,
ask your son. Ask Jonah.

11:51.580 --> 11:52.410
Jonah was there.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.741
In fact, he pulled a rifle on me,
right on your own lawn.

11:56.250 --> 11:59.162
[Helen] Are we done? Because
I have another appointment at noon.

12:00.510 --> 12:02.080
Oh, okay. With another client?

12:02.170 --> 12:04.638
Or do you only represent
the Navarro cartel?

12:07.930 --> 12:12.515
Look, Marty, you're under no obligation
to use the cartel's attorney.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.807
You can be represented
by anyone you choose.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.767
But if I were you, I sure as hell
wouldn't leave with her.

12:17.860 --> 12:19.066
Okay, then.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.607
What if you stay here, with me,
where it's safe?

12:25.700 --> 12:27.486
We can order in lunch.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.202
I'm happy with my representation.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.212
-[car doors closing]
-[engine starts]

12:59.650 --> 13:02.528
I'd ask you if you're okay,
but I know you're not.

13:03.110 --> 13:04.236
Fuckers.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.611
Deal with it later.

13:11.950 --> 13:14.453
[Wendy sighs and chuckles]

13:24.840 --> 13:28.958
As our Jewish brethren say, "To life."

13:29.050 --> 13:30.256
[Wendy chuckles]

13:30.350 --> 13:31.419
L ’cha/m.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.338
[sighs]

13:39.400 --> 13:41.106
[chuckles] It's good.

13:41.190 --> 13:44.068
-Uh-huh. Been saving it.
-[chuckles]

13:46.490 --> 13:52.235
There was a French writer,
long time ago...

13:56.290 --> 13:57.996
I can't remember his name.

13:59.460 --> 14:02.281
Well, I can't remember anybody's name.

14:03.630 --> 14:07.748
Anyway, he was old for those days...

14:08.720 --> 14:10.256
[clears throat] ...and very sick,

14:10.340 --> 14:14.925
lungs and ticker all going,
and he was stuck in bed.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.052
Now, this guy's a loner all his life. But
he tells the lady taking care of him

14:22.060 --> 14:25.609
that he wants to see his friends,
say goodbye.

14:27.070 --> 14:33.077
So she sends out word, and all his friends
come to his little hovel,

14:34.030 --> 14:37.579
gather around his deathbed,
telling stories.

14:40.290 --> 14:41.666
And you know what happens?

14:44.590 --> 14:45.705
What happens?

14:47.510 --> 14:49.717
-He doesn't die.
-[chuckles]

14:51.390 --> 14:56.885
And then after a couple days, the friends,
well, they leave. They have lives.

14:59.100 --> 15:00.636
And then he dies.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.603
Sad, but sweet.

15:05.570 --> 15:11.816
Because, when you think you're gonna
die yesterday, today is sweet.

15:16.410 --> 15:18.116
So, hang in, Wendy.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.326
Lose your shit tomorrow.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.707
Today's no day to fall apart.

15:28.210 --> 15:29.791
[chuckles and sniffles]

15:56.080 --> 15:57.274
They found my money.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.201
Well, maybe you shouldn't have
kept it on a shelf.

16:03.290 --> 16:05.827
Mom asked if you knew anything about it,
and I said no.

16:06.420 --> 16:08.661
-You should be thanking me.
-Thanks.

16:10.460 --> 16:11.791
But you need to be really careful.

16:13.220 --> 16:16.348
We both do. Next time, give me your money.

16:17.350 --> 16:19.557
I created two shell companies like Dad's.

16:20.890 --> 16:23.597
The money's safe. It can't be traced.

16:26.980 --> 16:30.564
Do you think I could have some of it?
For a van?

16:32.780 --> 16:35.066
-What?
-A van.

16:35.660 --> 16:39.073
I mean, you can live in it.
We can get away. You know?

16:39.990 --> 16:41.946
[stammers] I can't.

16:42.540 --> 16:43.859
But I gave it to you.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.246
But the money's tied up, Charlotte.

16:47.290 --> 16:48.837
It's safe, running interest.

16:53.340 --> 16:55.001
I want you to meet somebody.

16:56.590 --> 16:58.217
This here is Wally.

16:59.140 --> 17:04.385
Wally, say hello to Mrs. Snell.
Or maybe you could call her Darlene.

17:05.350 --> 17:07.898
Hello, Miss Darlene.

17:09.650 --> 17:11.436
[Jacob] Wally's come to help out a little.

17:12.860 --> 17:14.396
Help us out doing what?

17:15.400 --> 17:16.697
[Jacob] Help out.

17:16.780 --> 17:20.773
Spend time on the farm,
around the house, learn our ways.

17:20.870 --> 17:23.441
-Wouldn't that be good, Wally?
-Yes, sir.

17:26.290 --> 17:29.532
Wally was born near Linn.
Lost both his parents.

17:30.040 --> 17:34.545
Fell on hard times,
but righted himself a little, didn't you?

17:34.630 --> 17:38.214
-Would you excuse us for a minute, boy?
-Yes, ma'am.

17:44.810 --> 17:47.381
Why you bringing some kid
into our kitchen?

17:47.480 --> 17:50.472
He's a foster child, and I thought that...

17:51.070 --> 17:53.937
if he likes us and we like him,

17:54.690 --> 17:57.909
then maybe he might be...

17:58.570 --> 17:59.810
Our heir?

18:01.660 --> 18:07.530
No, I want a baby boy,
someone we can mold.

18:10.830 --> 18:13.458
We're gonna try this boy out, Darlene.

18:15.630 --> 18:16.915
So, please...

18:17.510 --> 18:20.468
keep an open mind, please?

18:21.140 --> 18:23.096
-[knock on door]
-[door opens]

18:23.180 --> 18:24.716
Oh.

18:24.810 --> 18:26.050
Am I interrupting something?

18:27.140 --> 18:28.801
You're interrupting nothin'.

18:31.270 --> 18:34.103
[Nix] FBI is all over Marty Byrde.

18:34.690 --> 18:37.568
He had a dozen men to his house.
Took him in for questioning.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.026
[Jacob] I know all about it.

18:39.610 --> 18:41.658
Well, you need to know something else.

18:41.740 --> 18:44.823
These feds. They're not messing around.

18:44.910 --> 18:47.617
And they don't care much
for local law enforcement.

18:47.700 --> 18:48.951
What are you saying?

18:49.870 --> 18:55.126
I'm saying that if the feds decide to come
around here, there's not much I can do.

18:56.090 --> 18:59.127
May I remind you of your debt to us?

19:00.590 --> 19:02.296
That's why I'm here.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.307
But, like I said, I can't--

19:05.390 --> 19:07.767
I'd offer you coffee,
but I just rinsed the pot.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.436
I'll be on my way, then.

19:14.310 --> 19:15.641
[Darlene] Oh, and, Sheriff.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.488
That boy on the porch? His name's Willy.

19:18.570 --> 19:19.559
Wally.

19:20.780 --> 19:24.523
On your way out, run him back down
where he came from.

19:27.370 --> 19:28.189
All right.

19:41.470 --> 19:43.131
Sit on the other side.

19:48.140 --> 19:49.459
Who's Ruth Langmore?

19:51.810 --> 19:57.350
We work together closely.
She's very valuable. She's smart.

19:59.820 --> 20:01.105
I shouldn't need to tell you this,

20:01.200 --> 20:04.272
but if we get any indication
that your loyalty isn't solid,

20:04.360 --> 20:06.487
arrangements will be made.
Do you understand that?

20:10.040 --> 20:12.497
-I'm sorry, do you understand that?
-Yeah, I understand that.

20:26.260 --> 20:28.308
[Helen] Okay, so tell me
about your computers.

20:28.390 --> 20:30.176
What are they likely to find on them?

20:30.680 --> 20:32.887
-Nothing.
-You sure about that?

20:34.190 --> 20:35.760
If they found anything,
I wouldn't be sitting here.

20:35.850 --> 20:37.602
Do you know that for a fact?

20:38.400 --> 20:41.187
You know, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't treat me like a child.
Speaking of, what about the money
on your daughter's shelf?

20:44.150 --> 20:46.618
-Is that my client's money?
-It is not.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.243
How much do they know,
your son and daughter, about everything?

20:55.330 --> 20:56.570
They don't know anything.

20:57.330 --> 20:59.582
Well, as a parent,
I find that implausible.

20:59.670 --> 21:01.410
Kids see things. They hear things.

21:03.340 --> 21:06.173
-What do your kids know?
-This isn't about my kids.

21:06.260 --> 21:09.423
They know that I'm opening a casino.
They think the raid is connected to that.

21:09.510 --> 21:11.512
Are you lying to protect them or yourself?

21:11.600 --> 21:15.479
Your son pulled a gun
on a federal agent, Marty. Pull over.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.500
[lighter clicks]

21:52.350 --> 21:55.763
My kids don't know I smoke. I hide it.

21:59.770 --> 22:01.226
What about the Snells?

22:02.270 --> 22:03.100
What about them?

22:03.690 --> 22:06.773
The FBI sent half its Midwest dipshits
to our little hamlet,

22:06.860 --> 22:10.523
so I'd say we have a problem with their
crop of opium poppies. Do you agree?

22:13.540 --> 22:14.859
I agree.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.667
I have a source
at the US Attorney's office.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.240
I can see if there's a warrant pulled.

22:22.920 --> 22:26.128
Because if the FBI find our poppies,
then our casino is dead.

22:26.210 --> 22:27.211
And if our casino is dead--

22:27.300 --> 22:29.791
Arrangements will have to be made.
I wish you'd stop saying that.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.505
Well, I really wish I didn't have to.

22:34.140 --> 22:38.053
I'm loyal to you. I've been loyal to you
for years, to a fault.

22:38.640 --> 22:41.973
If you have reason to suspect otherwise,
I'd like to hear about it.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.267
Why do you think you're sitting in my car?

22:54.120 --> 22:56.031
Call the Snells. Set up a meeting.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.881
[Rachel] Um, all right, you guys good?
Yeah?

23:19.680 --> 23:20.806
[man laughs]

23:22.980 --> 23:25.221
-What's up?
-Have you seen Marty?

23:27.070 --> 23:28.640
-Mnh-mnh.
-Have you heard?

23:30.110 --> 23:33.364
Just what everybody else heard.
They raided the house.

23:33.450 --> 23:35.941
-What about you?
-No, I haven't heard shit.

23:36.030 --> 23:38.828
I left Marty messages,
but he hasn't called back.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.069
[Rachel] Hmm.

23:44.080 --> 23:47.664
He doesn't leave anything here, does he?

23:48.840 --> 23:49.704
Like what?

23:50.300 --> 23:51.790
I don't know. His shit?

23:51.880 --> 23:56.340
Shit that he doesn't want, you know,
people to be going through, or...

23:57.760 --> 24:01.514
I mean, you think they got something
on him, or...

24:04.520 --> 24:07.819
-Do you want something to drink?
-No,no.

24:07.900 --> 24:09.561
[Rachel clears throat]

24:10.360 --> 24:11.395
Okay.

24:13.990 --> 24:15.651
You think they're gonna bring you in?

24:16.280 --> 24:19.408
They're more likely to bring you in,
since you're his partner and all.

24:19.490 --> 24:21.287
You're his friend and partner
in the strip club.

24:21.370 --> 24:23.577
Well, then he has a lot of partners.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.626
Sure fuckin' does. Hey, what would you do if he went down?

24:36.680 --> 24:38.341
I haven't thought that far.

24:39.140 --> 24:40.209
You should.

24:41.850 --> 24:43.727
You should get your story straight.

24:45.230 --> 24:46.936
I mean, fuck, we both should.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.429
[Ruth]
Yeah.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.351
[Rachel]
Me, if they ask what he does" .

24:55.860 --> 24:57.737
Rachel sounds buzzed.

24:58.700 --> 25:00.691
She may have a little Oxy problem.

25:01.830 --> 25:03.741
-Roy_-
-Come on.

25:04.460 --> 25:05.859
It's game day.

25:06.370 --> 25:07.667
It's why we do this, Trev.

25:07.750 --> 25:10.082
It's why I made sure
you came down here from Chicago.

25:10.170 --> 25:11.125
Yeah?

25:12.920 --> 25:15.548
The cartel sending its lawyer...

25:16.050 --> 25:20.635
[laughs] The expression on Marty's face
was priceless.

25:21.680 --> 25:24.137
And by tonight,
nobody'll trust anybody else,

25:24.230 --> 25:25.436
and the whole thing'll just topple.

25:25.520 --> 25:29.012
Just be careful. Stay by the book.

25:29.610 --> 25:34.809
The slightest whiff of blown Miranda
or entrapment, all this gets thrown out.

25:35.650 --> 25:39.359
You're not my fucking boss.
So, just follow the leader here.

25:42.830 --> 25:47.449
IfI hadn't vouched on your psych eval,
you wouldn't have a job right now.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.207
You know what? Big picture?

25:50.290 --> 25:53.418
You're a worker bee, and I'm the queen.

25:56.630 --> 26:00.839
Do me a favor, Roy. Don't give
Rachel Garrison any more opioids.

26:00.930 --> 26:01.919
[Petty sighs]

26:02.010 --> 26:04.467
And this time,
try to keep your asset alive.

26:07.140 --> 26:08.596
You're just jealous...

26:09.480 --> 26:14.315
because that big, beautiful bear fucked me
50 times harder than you ever could.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.572
-[Evans] Where are you going?
-To a titty bar.

26:27.910 --> 26:29.571
[Wendy]
Why did Helen drop you oh‘?

26:29.670 --> 26:32.207
Because Helen was my lawyer.

26:33.630 --> 26:34.870
[exhales]

26:37.340 --> 26:38.546
[door closes]

26:41.600 --> 26:42.544
Are you okay?

26:42.640 --> 26:45.882
No, they drove me halfway to Benton.
I thought they were gonna kill me.

26:45.970 --> 26:48.768
-What?
-Yeah, they're questioning our loyalty.

26:48.940 --> 26:53.058
-Why?
-The FBI. That fed Petty, he's a...

26:54.020 --> 26:56.773
He's a real bastard, a real piece of work,
you know?

26:57.690 --> 26:59.817
He says he's gonna try the kids as adults.

26:59.900 --> 27:02.118
-They can't do that.
-Well, they do it all the time.

27:02.700 --> 27:03.769
And Charlotte...

27:05.830 --> 27:07.650
I mean, she... she...

27:08.330 --> 27:09.991
Charlotte fucked up royally.

27:10.750 --> 27:11.910
I know. I yelled at her.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.377
Oh, did you? That's great.
Problem solved, I guess.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.081
Are you blaming me?

27:17.590 --> 27:19.797
No. No, I'm just...

27:20.590 --> 27:22.046
you know... Sorry.

27:28.890 --> 27:30.721
Aanay, Buddy's better. [chuckles]

27:31.940 --> 27:33.510
Probably outlive all of us.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.438
-Is Jonah in his room? Yeah?
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

27:43.370 --> 27:44.564
[knock on door]

27:44.660 --> 27:47.788
Hey, pal.
Um, I just got a quick question for you.

27:47.870 --> 27:53.456
Um... I need to know if you pulled a gun
on a man.

27:53.540 --> 27:55.167
You're not gonna get in
any trouble for it.

27:55.250 --> 27:57.127
I just need to know if you did it.

27:58.090 --> 28:00.661
Would've been a couple months ago?
In August?

28:01.340 --> 28:02.671
He was on our property.

28:07.350 --> 28:10.171
Okay. What was he doing?

28:12.440 --> 28:15.512
I don't know. That's why I pulled the gun.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.812
Have you seen him since then? Or before?

28:20.740 --> 28:23.106
Once at the Blue Cat,
but he didn't see me.

28:24.450 --> 28:26.315
And then this morning, at the house.

28:27.780 --> 28:29.236
And was it the main guy?

28:31.250 --> 28:32.114
Yeah.

28:33.330 --> 28:36.379
All right, that's it. Thanks.

28:48.140 --> 28:49.596
[tires screech]

28:53.770 --> 28:55.180
Ruth Langmore?

28:58.650 --> 28:59.719
I want my lawyer.

28:59.820 --> 29:02.436
No. No, you don't.
Then I'd have to arrest you.

29:02.530 --> 29:03.485
For what?

29:04.070 --> 29:06.447
How about a double murder,
for starters?

29:07.370 --> 29:08.940
You know, I just gotta ask you.

29:09.030 --> 29:10.827
What forces do you think
you're messing with

29:10.910 --> 29:13.367
when a double murder's the least
of your problems?

29:14.870 --> 29:16.610
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

29:16.710 --> 29:20.168
Oh, no? How about the Navarro cartel?
Ring any kind of a bell?

29:20.750 --> 29:24.379
Listen carefully,
because you have three options here.

29:24.470 --> 29:28.793
Turn state's right now, end up
in a cute little Arizona ranch house,

29:28.890 --> 29:32.212
with 800 bucks a month,
for doing absolutely nothing.

29:32.310 --> 29:33.550
How does that sound?

29:34.140 --> 29:37.052
-Sounds like "go fuck yourself."
-Clever.

29:37.650 --> 29:40.517
You want me to explain
how that works exactly?

29:40.610 --> 29:44.603
Look, I'm not your problem here.
I'm your fuckin' solution.

29:45.360 --> 29:49.478
Second option,
I arrest you for killing your uncles.

29:50.070 --> 29:52.447
And maybe you don't know it, but juries,

29:52.540 --> 29:55.748
they tend to look down on people
who kill their own family members.

29:56.660 --> 30:01.666
What you do is you roll into a ball
or whatever,

30:01.750 --> 30:05.459
and you take your click, right?
And you put it up your ass.

30:05.550 --> 30:09.998
Third option is I do nothing,
and the cartel kills you.

30:10.850 --> 30:12.169
Today, probably.

30:13.220 --> 30:16.269
They kill you. They kill your cousins,

30:16.350 --> 30:19.092
because that's just how they operate.

30:19.190 --> 30:21.476
And you know, I really couldn't care less.

30:22.110 --> 30:23.850
But I liked your Uncle Russ.

30:24.860 --> 30:26.066
A lot.

30:27.240 --> 30:30.778
Yeah. We put our tongues
down each other's throats

30:30.870 --> 30:32.690
and our dicks up each other's asses,

30:32.780 --> 30:36.489
but I guess I take this
kind of personally.

30:37.710 --> 30:40.076
See, you.

30:40.830 --> 30:42.707
I think you're just a piece of shit.

30:43.290 --> 30:48.671
You're just a dangerous, worthless,
raggedy—ass little redneck piece of shit.

30:51.090 --> 30:53.843
I bet you're thinking, "Marty Byrde...

30:54.680 --> 30:58.798
He'll protect me.
He won't let the cartel kill me."

30:58.890 --> 31:00.221
Mnh-mnh.

31:00.310 --> 31:01.971
But I just talked to him.

31:02.650 --> 31:07.428
I told him how you tried to kill him,
how you wired his dock, so...

31:07.530 --> 31:08.690
[winces]

31:11.660 --> 31:14.572
Now, don't be too obvious, but...

31:15.490 --> 31:18.789
look over your shoulder, one o'clock.

31:27.550 --> 31:29.336
See, that's the cartel.

31:30.300 --> 31:31.756
And now guess what.

31:33.050 --> 31:34.927
They think we're friends.

31:38.770 --> 31:42.763
You know, Sinatra used to say,
"Live every day like it's your last.

31:44.150 --> 31:45.686
And one day, you'll be right."

31:52.700 --> 31:56.818
My baby is a freak //l(e me
And she knows just what 1' Me

31:57.540 --> 32:01.499
She carries all the keys to the places
That no one dares to ﬁnd

32:01.580 --> 32:06.449
She won ’t tell nobody
What goes on in these walls

32:06.540 --> 32:11.876
If they talked
They’d probably tell you all about love

32:12.010 --> 32:14.888
[music continues]

32:30.860 --> 32:32.851
[breathes deeply]

32:49.840 --> 32:52.126
-[Darlene] What kind of source?
-[Helen] A reliable one.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.084
[Darlene] Who?

32:53.170 --> 32:54.467
[Helen] Forget the source.

32:54.550 --> 32:57.849
The FBI are coming to search this place
very soon.

32:57.930 --> 33:00.842
They searched our place pretty thoroughly.
Jacob, you were there. You saw it.

33:02.060 --> 33:05.052
We can move the labs
to the bunkers underground.

33:05.140 --> 33:07.608
And what about these fields?
You gonna move them underground?

33:08.110 --> 33:10.977
Twenty years we've stayed clear
of the authorities.

33:11.070 --> 33:13.106
I think we know what to do.

33:13.190 --> 33:17.115
We have already spent millions
on this casino.

33:17.200 --> 33:21.864
If they find these poppies,
we will lose it all. Destroy them today.

33:22.540 --> 33:24.610
I don't appreciate your tone.

33:25.460 --> 33:28.839
-I honestly don't care.
-[Jacob] We made a deal with you people.

33:29.420 --> 33:34.835
Now, it wasn't easy to start with,
but where I come from, a deal is a deal.

33:35.630 --> 33:39.214
And now it seems like every day,
somebody wants to change that deal.

33:39.300 --> 33:42.963
That deal, to erect a casino,
requires that all parties take

33:43.060 --> 33:46.097
all necessary precautions
to protect that casino's viability.

33:46.190 --> 33:49.432
Our deal was for you
to distribute our heroin

33:49.520 --> 33:51.761
and for you to launder our money.

33:52.980 --> 33:54.527
Y'all knew we grew heroin.

33:55.110 --> 33:56.850
That was preexisting knowledge.

33:56.950 --> 33:59.612
No one's denying that.
But circumstances have changed.

33:59.700 --> 34:01.110
[Darlene] A deal's a deal. What's changed?

34:04.080 --> 34:05.707
You wanna know what's changed?

34:05.790 --> 34:08.031
The FBI is on their way over here
as we speak.

34:08.120 --> 34:11.999
-I'd call that a change, wouldn't you?
-We need your help, okay?

34:12.590 --> 34:14.956
Please. Jacob.

34:16.720 --> 34:20.633
-You want us to destroy that field?
-Yes, today.

34:20.720 --> 34:24.804
Mm-hmm.
Then you keep paying us for our product.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.592
You want us to keep paying you
for heroin that you're not delivering?

34:28.690 --> 34:29.645
Mm-hmm.

34:30.940 --> 34:33.226
Otherwise, we'll just take our chances.

34:36.860 --> 34:38.350
[laughs]

34:48.410 --> 34:52.039
I'm spending way too many billable hours
arguing with these rednecks.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.791
I'd use a different word if I were you.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.790
-I hate this place.
-Yeah.

34:56.880 --> 35:00.793
Those sheets at the Ramada?
Ugh. Like sandpaper, and I miss my kids.

35:02.010 --> 35:03.386
[sighs]

35:04.350 --> 35:06.716
We have to get rid of
those poppies ourselves.

35:07.810 --> 35:11.473
Well....
Ourselves. It would cause a war.

35:11.560 --> 35:13.858
Then fucking get them
to change their minds,

35:13.940 --> 35:16.147
because they may not be worried
about the feds, but get this.

35:16.230 --> 35:18.141
My client is extremely worried.

35:18.860 --> 35:20.600
We take no chances, okay?

35:20.700 --> 35:23.316
To us, the acceptable risk here is zero.
Got that?

35:24.280 --> 35:25.861
[engine starts]

35:38.590 --> 35:42.139
[Darlene] Your friend Wilkes,
he funds that orphanage, doesn't he?

35:42.890 --> 35:43.959
[Wendy] Uh-huh.

35:44.760 --> 35:48.469
You think he could help me and Jacob
find a baby?

35:50.730 --> 35:51.879
I'm sorry.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.766
A child, Wendy, a baby boy.

35:56.020 --> 36:01.356
We'd take more kindly to destroying
our field if you could get us a baby.

36:05.740 --> 36:08.573
We've done a lot of things, Marty,
things that we said we would never do.

36:08.660 --> 36:11.117
But I am sorry. I am not gonna help
that woman get a baby.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.075
I would get them quadruplets
if they would plow that field.

36:13.170 --> 36:15.240
What does she think?
She can just snap her fingers--

36:15.330 --> 36:16.877
Who the hell knows?
What else do you want to do?

36:16.960 --> 36:18.541
-I don't know. I don't know.
-[cell phone rings]

36:18.630 --> 36:19.619
Hey, Ruth.

36:20.210 --> 36:21.586
They're setting me up, Marty.

36:21.670 --> 36:24.798
That fed Petty fuckin' blindsides me
in the parking lot

36:24.890 --> 36:26.960
and starts saying all this fuckin' shit.

36:27.050 --> 36:29.211
, [Ma/1y]
L/sten, not now, okay?

36:29.310 --> 36:31.016
You know I didn't talk to them, right?

36:31.100 --> 36:34.012
-Hey, not over the phone.
-,4// I’m just asking--

36:34.100 --> 36:36.432
I said not over the phone.
I'm gonna call you later.

36:37.190 --> 36:39.647
-When?
-Later. I’m hanging up now.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.656
[muffled music playing]

37:07.180 --> 37:10.001
[cell phone ringing]

37:15.270 --> 37:17.056
-Hello.
-[Ruth]
5am.

37:18.190 --> 37:21.728
Wait, why are you calling me?
Aren't you, like, in the office right now?

37:22.490 --> 37:24.446
I need you to give me a ride home.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.157
Uh... okay.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.281
And I need you to pull around back.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.200
[exhales]

37:49.180 --> 37:51.922
Hey, QUYS,
how's your day going so far?

37:52.850 --> 37:55.887
God, remember when waiters used to come up
to the table,

37:55.980 --> 37:58.596
middle of your meal and ask you,
"How is everything?"

37:59.270 --> 38:01.727
Now they have to ask,
"How's everything tasting?"

38:01.820 --> 38:05.608
All because some poor bastard
was probably fighting with his wife

38:05.700 --> 38:07.656
and yelled, "We're getting a divorce."

38:07.740 --> 38:09.947
Hey, I told you everything that I know
this morning.

38:10.030 --> 38:12.737
Oh, actually,
I'm here to talk with Mrs. Byrde.

38:13.580 --> 38:17.414
But if you both want to, that's okay, too.

38:17.500 --> 38:21.618
Feel free to call your lavwer,
and we can make it a double date.

38:21.710 --> 38:22.870
Where do you want to do it?

38:23.460 --> 38:25.257
[clicks tongue] Uh...

38:25.340 --> 38:27.501
-Well, inside?
-[Wendy] The kids are home.

38:28.010 --> 38:29.716
Okay, right.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.791
So, do you guys have an open marriage?

38:32.310 --> 38:36.019
You know, some kind of arrangement?

38:37.100 --> 38:38.636
What are you talking about?

38:39.350 --> 38:45.107
Oh, Charles Wilkes?
You call him Charlie in your email.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.230
You two having an affair?

38:48.900 --> 38:51.698
-Wow.
-Sorry, you wanna do this inside?

38:51.780 --> 38:53.190
Ah, shit, the kids.

38:53.280 --> 38:54.577
Sorry about this, Marty.

38:54.660 --> 38:56.446
In one email to you, Wendy,

38:56.540 --> 39:00.032
Charlie talks about doing something
that he shouldn't have,

39:00.120 --> 39:04.409
but that a part of him kind of thought
you wanted him to.

39:04.500 --> 39:08.960
What did he do? Did he kiss you?
He feel you up?

39:10.630 --> 39:12.928
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
You're out of line.

39:13.010 --> 39:15.808
-This is an ethics violation.
-You wanna hit me, Marty?

39:15.890 --> 39:17.471
It'd be a pretty bad idea,
don't you think?

39:17.560 --> 39:18.595
Marty, it's okay.

39:20.100 --> 39:21.897
[chuckles] It's okay.

39:23.060 --> 39:25.938
Well, it's kind of touching,

39:26.530 --> 39:31.229
the way he still defends your honor.
I mean, after what you did.

39:31.820 --> 39:33.117
Who do you think you are?

39:33.200 --> 39:35.782
[Petty] A federal agent conducting
a criminal investigation.

39:35.870 --> 39:38.532
And whether you've accepted it or not,
you're a criminal, Wendy,

39:38.620 --> 39:39.780
in serious trouble, I'd say.

39:39.870 --> 39:41.861
In serious marital trouble,
if I'm reading any of this right.

39:42.710 --> 39:45.031
-Are you finished?
-No, not quite.

39:46.420 --> 39:47.660
Hmm.

39:51.760 --> 39:52.966
I've seen it.

39:53.550 --> 39:54.460
We've talked about it.

39:56.640 --> 39:57.846
Really?

39:58.640 --> 39:59.595
Wow.

40:00.350 --> 40:01.590
And what'd you say?

40:02.560 --> 40:03.970
You say that "I'm sorry"?

40:04.060 --> 40:06.392
[Wendy] You really think you can shame me?

40:07.190 --> 40:09.317
Shame us into witness protection?

40:09.860 --> 40:12.738
What's your angle here?
Divide and conquer?

40:13.240 --> 40:14.400
[chuckles softly]

40:14.490 --> 40:16.776
Are you guys just staying together
for the kids?

40:17.830 --> 40:19.400
Because if you really want
to do them a favor,

40:19.500 --> 40:22.287
and by thatI mean
save their fucking lives,

40:22.370 --> 40:24.122
then get them out here right now.

40:24.210 --> 40:27.623
-We'll get in my car and get out of--
-Get the fuck off our property.

40:44.600 --> 40:46.431
Why would you save that video?

40:53.700 --> 40:56.772
[door opens, closes]

41:13.880 --> 41:16.383
-What are you doing?
-[gasp51

41:16.470 --> 41:17.630
What's it look like?

41:19.010 --> 41:20.090
You hear from Marty?

41:20.600 --> 41:24.229
-No, he won't talk over the phone.
-He's right.

41:27.230 --> 41:28.549
What's the matter with you?

41:29.060 --> 41:31.813
-I got a bad feeling about this, Daddy.
-Yeah?

41:32.440 --> 41:33.600
Well, where you going?

41:34.450 --> 41:37.351
-What?
-You're packing. Where you going?

41:42.410 --> 41:43.536
I don't know.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.529
That's your first mistake.

41:46.370 --> 41:50.739
And what'd I tell you? How many times?
We don't rat, and we don't run.

41:51.250 --> 41:52.581
You know why you don't run?

41:53.510 --> 41:54.795
It makes you look guilty.

41:55.420 --> 41:58.173
Now, did you rat anybody out?

41:59.220 --> 42:00.847
Well, what are you worried about?

42:03.470 --> 42:04.721
The cartel.

42:06.940 --> 42:08.555
Maybe they think I ratted.

42:08.650 --> 42:12.142
You ain't done nothin' wrong, Ruth.
Okay?

42:12.900 --> 42:17.109
There's one way in here and one way out.
Plus, we got all manner of weaponry.

42:17.610 --> 42:20.238
And it's dark. They don't know the layout.

42:21.120 --> 42:23.862
If those Mexicans are stupid enough
to come here half-cocked,

42:23.950 --> 42:26.157
we'll take 'em out. Bim-bam-boom.

[door opens]

42:52.060 --> 42:53.266
[Marty] Hey, Buddy.

42:53.860 --> 42:55.020
What's the score?

42:55.650 --> 42:58.949
By the time you're in the ground,
there won't be any football.

42:59.990 --> 43:01.651
Not like this, anyway.

43:02.660 --> 43:05.322
National Flag Football League.

43:06.540 --> 43:08.405
Glad I won't have to see that.

43:13.750 --> 43:14.910
What's going on?

43:16.800 --> 43:19.166
I gotta do something
about those poppy fields.

-Snells?
-Mm-hmm.

43:23.680 --> 43:25.671
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know. I'm tired of playing
monkey in the middle, though.

43:30.440 --> 43:34.558
[sighs] Yeah, well, that's because
you're trying to please everybody,

43:34.650 --> 43:37.392
and it's not goddamn possible.

43:38.490 --> 43:39.946
You gotta act.

43:40.990 --> 43:43.276
And let everybody else react.

[doorbell rings]

If there are children in the house,
they should go to their rooms.

[Wendy] How can we help you?

44:21.820 --> 44:23.151
What's going on?

44:25.990 --> 44:28.868
Is this Ruth? Talking to that fed?

44:39.710 --> 44:42.338
I'd say we have a problem, wouldn't you?

44:43.260 --> 44:44.579
[Wendy] Seriously? Ruth?

44:46.510 --> 44:48.057
-Do you trust her?
-Absolutely.

44:48.140 --> 44:51.177
What about you, Marty?
Do you trust her with your life?

44:56.610 --> 44:57.474
Yeah.

44:59.650 --> 45:00.469
You hesitated.

45:01.070 --> 45:03.106
-You can trust her.
-[Helen] Why did you hesitate? [Marty]
I was considering the question,
Helen.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.466

45:28.850 --> 45:30.715
-Marty.
-Hey, where are you r/ght now?

-./"m home. Where do you think?
-You gotta get out of there.

45:34.180 --> 45:36.091
I need you to meet me somewhere, in town.

45:37.190 --> 45:39.010
What, now? Why?

45:39.110 --> 45:40.975
Behind the mo vie theater, that lot?

45:41.070 --> 45:43.061
What the fuck's going on, Marty?

45:44.950 --> 45:47.657
No. I’m staying put.

45:47.740 --> 45:49.867
Fine, don't move.
I'm gonna be right there.

45:50.620 --> 45:52.531
Marty, they will kill her.

45:53.660 --> 45:55.366
Why did you hesitate?

45:56.670 --> 45:57.876
She tried to kill me.

45:59.250 --> 46:01.912
-What?
-Ruth tried to kill me.

46:02.960 --> 46:05.258
Bruce turned on me. You cheated on me.

46:05.970 --> 46:07.676
Maybe I'm not the best judge of character.

46:21.520 --> 46:22.771
[Charlotte] Close the door.

46:31.530 --> 46:32.861
[sighs]

46:34.080 --> 46:37.709
Mom... Mom had an affair.

46:40.500 --> 46:43.492
-What? With who?
-I don't know.

46:46.670 --> 46:49.889
-How do you know?
-I just heard them talking about it.

46:51.550 --> 46:53.177
-Who, her and Dad?
-Yes.

46:55.430 --> 46:58.934
He said, "You cheated on me."
And she didn't even say anything.

46:59.020 --> 47:00.760
I mean, she didn't even deny it.

47:03.070 --> 47:03.968
So...

47:05.860 --> 47:07.236
what do you think's gonna happen?

47:07.740 --> 47:08.855
I don't know.

47:10.950 --> 47:14.784
You don't think they'll split up
or something?

47:38.600 --> 47:40.807
[Buddy] Nobody's functioning around here.

47:44.400 --> 47:46.186
Put the pasta in, Wendy.

-[Wendy] Are you hungry?
-No.

47:54.740 --> 47:56.321
[water running]

47:59.660 --> 48:01.742
You know, there's a lot going on.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.628
And when that's happening,
and you don't know what to do,

48:06.630 --> 48:10.748
you do what's right in front of you.
You understand?

48:13.340 --> 48:14.591
I like Marty.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.256
But he thinks too much.

48:17.890 --> 48:19.300
He's got to act.

48:21.850 --> 48:23.147
Somebody does.

48:47.670 --> 48:48.876
That fuckin' fed, Marty,

48:48.960 --> 48:52.259
had me outside the strip club,
saying that I murdered Russ and Boyd.

48:52.340 --> 48:55.047
Yeah? If he had any evidence,
you'd already be arrested.

48:55.140 --> 48:58.303
What about the cartel, Marty?
He said that they're gonna kill me.

48:58.810 --> 49:01.176
So? It's all part of the same thing.
That's just his play.

49:01.270 --> 49:02.089
He's trying to scare you.

49:02.180 --> 49:04.387
He's trying to shake us all up
so that we turn on each other. Did you say something to him?

49:07.610 --> 49:08.429
What?

49:09.020 --> 49:13.730
Did you try to kill me last August
on my dock?

49:14.320 --> 49:16.948
Your car broke down. I loaned you the van.

49:18.450 --> 49:20.406
Did you wire that dock? Yes or no?

49:24.210 --> 49:25.450
It was a long time ago.

49:26.040 --> 49:29.589
No, it was not. It was three months ago.
You were working for me. Come on.

49:29.670 --> 49:31.706
[Ruth exhales slowly]

49:31.800 --> 49:34.337
Hey, I need to know if I can trust you.

Our lives are on the line,
both of our lives.

49:38.930 --> 49:39.749
Okay?

I swear to God, Marty. You can trust me.
I swear on my life.

49:47.150 --> 49:48.686
I swear on Wyatt's life.

49:56.820 --> 49:58.868
-[Marty] Cade. You don't need that.
-[gun cocks]

49:58.950 --> 50:00.656
-[Cade] Yeah, I do.

50:00.740 --> 50:02.867
[Cade] No. Done talking.

50:03.700 --> 50:04.701

-[Cade] Get the fuck off my property.

50:15.220 --> 50:16.960

[Marty] You can trust her.
I just talked to her.

50:29.100 --> 50:31.011
Well, you weren't so sure an hour ago.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.180
Well, we'll know soon enough.

50:34.990 --> 50:38.153
-[stammers] You told 'em I was here?
-No.

50:38.240 --> 50:39.867
[Ruth] Then how do they know where I live?

50:39.950 --> 50:41.861
[Marty] They know where everybody lives,
all right, Ruth? [Cade grunting] Fuck off!

50:43.950 --> 50:45.781
You little-- fucking Marty.

50:49.580 --> 50:53.243
Let go of me! No! No!

50:54.300 --> 50:56.120
Stop! Don't!

50:57.760 --> 50:59.079
[grunting]

51:01.050 --> 51:02.176
Let go!

51:07.980 --> 51:09.015

-[man]
lVame?
-It's Wendy Byrde, for Darlene.

51:50.730 --> 51:54.814
-You don't have to do this.
-It was my idea, God damn it.

52:01.280 --> 52:02.349
[Buddy] Go, go.

52:16.290 --> 52:18.952

52:19.050 --> 52:20.506
[Ruth] No! No!

52:20.590 --> 52:23.502
Have you ever spoken
to Agent Petty before today?

52:23.590 --> 52:27.139
Have you stolen from the cartel?
Have you stolen from Marty Byrde?

52:27.930 --> 52:29.090
[coughing continues]

52:29.180 --> 52:31.808
Do you understand
that betraying Marty Byrde

52:31.890 --> 52:33.517
is the same as betraying the cartel?

52:33.600 --> 52:36.148
-Yes.
-Oh, I don't think you do.

52:36.230 --> 52:38.858
[muffled screaming]

52:39.730 --> 52:41.277
