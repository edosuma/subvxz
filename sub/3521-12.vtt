01:47.457 --> 01:50.960
Junior, hey.
Jimmy,
how you doin', kid?

01:50.960 --> 01:53.463
How many of these things
we gotta go to?

01:53.463 --> 01:56.466
Brendan filone's mother
at the kid's funeral,
the way she carried on.

01:56.466 --> 01:58.968
Fuckin' manners.
I just want you to know,

01:59.469 --> 02:01.971
i always thought you had
that right too, you know?

02:02.472 --> 02:05.975
Jimmy, let me tell you
something. Don't worry
about what i know.

02:17.604 --> 02:21.107
I was just over
to tony's house.
Oh, yeah?

02:21.107 --> 02:23.610
How was he?

02:23.610 --> 02:27.614
He looked, uh, tired.

02:27.747 --> 02:30.250
Maybe he's
got hypoglycemia.

02:30.366 --> 02:33.119
- Maybe he's depressed.
- What's he got to be
depressed about?

02:33.503 --> 02:36.256
He talked to me
about it.

02:36.256 --> 02:38.508
- Depression?
- Well--

02:38.875 --> 02:40.877
what the fuck
do you know
about depression?

02:41.010 --> 02:43.012
Nothin'.
I'm just sayin', that's all.

02:43.012 --> 02:45.515
But he's sleeping all the time.
He's not taking care
of himself.

02:45.632 --> 02:47.884
A lot of top guys
had dark moods.

02:47.884 --> 02:50.887
That winston churchill,
he drank a quart of brandy
before breakfast.

02:51.271 --> 02:54.891
And, uh, napoleon,
he was a moody fuck too.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.531
- Am i nuts? -

03:01.531 --> 03:05.034
a day at the mall in mules
and i'll be crippled for life.

03:10.039 --> 03:14.043
Oh, i told lilliana to put
some giambott' in the microwave
for when you get up.

03:15.545 --> 03:17.547
Tony, how are you fixed
for sweat socks?

03:17.547 --> 03:20.533
We're gonna be right by
the sports authority.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.470
Tony?

03:26.472 --> 03:29.475
Tony, i know
you're in there.
I know you hear me.

03:29.475 --> 03:32.478
Will you let me sleep?
Does your lady therapist
know about this?

03:32.979 --> 03:34.981
Maybe you need
more medication.

03:34.981 --> 03:37.984
She already got me
on lithium and prozac.
What else you want?

03:37.984 --> 03:41.487
Aromatherapy, something.
This is not normal,

03:41.487 --> 03:44.490
for a healthy adult male
to take to bed like this.

03:44.490 --> 03:48.861
I got a lot on my mind.
Really?
Well, move over then.

03:50.363 --> 03:52.365
Those indictments are
hangin' over my head too.

03:52.365 --> 03:56.269
Plus i got the roots
in the pipe to the street.

03:56.269 --> 04:00.757
My best friend pussy
has disappeared. He's
probably fuckin' dead, okay?

04:00.757 --> 04:03.760
This downturn started long
before pussy bompensiero
disappeared.

04:08.298 --> 04:11.801
If you want me, i will be
at the paramus mall...

04:11.801 --> 04:16.221
getting your son a suit
to wear to his first formal.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.984
Carmela, come on!
Sunlight is good
for people, tony.

04:27.984 --> 04:31.120
In alaska, they wear these
little light hats in the winter
so they don't get depressed.

06:37.580 --> 06:39.582
Sorry, junior.

06:39.582 --> 06:42.085
The jackson
street bridge was out.

06:42.085 --> 06:46.589
If you say you're gonna
be someplace, be someplace.
Sorry.

06:46.589 --> 06:48.591
Junior,
you all right?

06:49.092 --> 06:51.594
Porkchop boy was here,
that fuckin' altieri.

06:53.596 --> 06:55.598
Runnin' his mouth about
the brendan filone hit.

06:56.099 --> 06:59.602
Is that what him and my other
capos talk about behind my back
at the fuckin' old folks home?

06:59.602 --> 07:02.105
Well, the
meeting's adjourned
at the green grove.

07:02.105 --> 07:06.109
Chucky and i spoke
to donnie p. , and the thing,
it's happenin' tomorrow.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.363
That quick? Good.
Yeah.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.366
Black guys.
It'll never lead back.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.868
Think they got
apisciatoio
in this place?

07:18.871 --> 07:22.375
Look at her like that.
Mariolina gave me
my first hand job--

07:22.375 --> 07:25.995
me and vincent maniscalooo
in the alley behind
the chicken market.

07:25.995 --> 07:29.882
- Junior.
- God, what am i saying
at this poor woman's wake?

07:31.384 --> 07:33.886
I just wanted to let you know
so you didn't have to worry.

07:34.003 --> 07:37.507
- Everything's taken care of
about tony.
- Let's go.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.643
When i was a little kid,
no older than that,

07:40.643 --> 07:43.646
i always used to wonder
why nobody collected
prayer cards...

07:43.646 --> 07:46.149
like they collect
baseball cards.

07:46.149 --> 07:50.403
Thousands of bucks
for honus wagner...

07:50.403 --> 07:52.905
and jack shit for jesus.

07:52.905 --> 07:56.409
It's going down
in a newsstand that he goes to
by the medical center.

07:56.526 --> 08:00.530
Where he spills his guts
on some fuckin'
shrink's carpet.

08:01.030 --> 08:04.033
Junior, these guys
are very, very good.

08:04.534 --> 08:06.035
Donnie paduana did time
with them at rahway.

08:06.536 --> 08:08.538
And i was very specific.

08:08.538 --> 08:12.542
He's not gonna suffer.
He's gonna have an open casket.
I promise.

08:12.542 --> 08:16.045
Enough! I don't wanna
hear any more.

08:16.045 --> 08:18.931
Jesus, michael,
if i delegate,
i delegate.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.435
Is that what time it is?

08:22.935 --> 08:28.057
There is absolutely nothing
on the street about
the big guy, t, anywhere.

08:31.561 --> 08:34.063
I went to see
his family.

08:34.063 --> 08:39.068
Angela doesn't know shit,
or she deserves an
academy fuckin' award.

08:39.068 --> 08:41.571
His goomah either.

08:41.571 --> 08:44.574
I don't wanna hear
no more talkin' about pussy.

08:45.074 --> 08:49.078
Mr. Tony,
let me take that robe
and wash it for you.

08:49.078 --> 08:51.581
Did i ask you
to take the robe?

08:57.086 --> 09:01.090
Jimmy altieri
was in the bing.

09:01.090 --> 09:04.093
Can't even look him
in the face anymore.

09:04.093 --> 09:07.096
If he's wired,
it's doing jack shit
for the government...

09:07.096 --> 09:11.100
'cause all we feed him now
is deliberate bullshit
till we can--

09:11.100 --> 09:15.605
you know.
Don't do nothin'
about jimmy.

09:15.605 --> 09:18.107
I don't even know
if he's the guy
that flipped.

09:20.610 --> 09:23.112
I don't know nothin'
no more.

09:26.115 --> 09:29.619
Pussy probably freaked out
and he's lammin' it,
that's all.

09:33.623 --> 09:36.125
How many times
do i gotta say it?

09:40.880 --> 09:43.883
You goin' somewhere, t?
You want me to drive you?
No.

09:43.883 --> 09:48.137
- I usually drive you.
- I'm goin' downstairs.

09:48.137 --> 09:50.273
What are you gonna do?

09:50.273 --> 09:52.775
I'm gonna get my pants outta
the fuckin' dryer, okay?

10:28.177 --> 10:30.680
Hello.
Hi.

10:30.680 --> 10:34.183
Is this yours?
I found it in the yard.

10:34.183 --> 10:37.320
Oh, no. Really?

10:38.821 --> 10:40.823
I thought
the cusamanos were away.

10:41.324 --> 10:44.827
Yeah, they went
in bermuda to play golf.

10:46.829 --> 10:48.948
You're from italy,
aren't you?

10:49.448 --> 10:52.451
My english is pitiful.
No.

10:52.835 --> 10:54.837
You speak very good.

10:54.837 --> 10:57.707
Your english is better
than my italian.

10:59.208 --> 11:00.710
"Principles of oral surgery"?

11:01.210 --> 11:06.215
I'm a student. I'm here
as a part of an exchange program
between our two countries.

11:06.349 --> 11:10.853
Boy, if my dentist looked
like you, i'd stay awake
during a root canal.

11:12.355 --> 11:15.358
All right.
I'll, uh-- i'll let you study.

11:16.859 --> 11:20.363
Thank you for bring me--

11:20.363 --> 11:22.365
i don't know
how to say in english.

11:22.365 --> 11:24.867
Well, that makes two of us.

11:27.370 --> 11:29.739
Bye.

12:17.536 --> 12:20.039
Remember,
they don't want
nothin' above the neck.

12:26.929 --> 12:29.298
Whoa.

12:33.936 --> 12:36.689
Doughnuts? No wonder
he can't lose weight.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.191
Where's he goin' now?

12:42.695 --> 12:45.698
- Yo, sir? Excuse me.
- What?

12:45.698 --> 12:47.700
Could you pull forward
so we can get out?

12:47.950 --> 12:50.953
Give me a minute.
Police department.

12:50.953 --> 12:52.955
Where's your badge?

12:52.955 --> 12:55.324
Man, i said move
this piece of shit
fuckin' now!

12:55.324 --> 12:58.828
Get the fuck
outta my face.

13:02.331 --> 13:06.335
Shit!
We gonna have to waste
this motherfucker too?

13:06.335 --> 13:09.588
Let soprano get his doughnuts.
We'll pop him when he gets out.

13:28.491 --> 13:33.112
- Where's he goin'?
- Let's see if he left his
motherfuckin' keys in the car.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.124
Man, this is fucked up.

13:53.632 --> 13:55.634
No. No.

13:55.634 --> 13:58.637
Jesus. You make a left
at the stop sign.

13:59.021 --> 14:01.524
You must be lookin'
straight at us. What are
you, fuckin' ray charles?

14:01.524 --> 14:05.144
Jesus christ!
How the hell could
it not have gone down?

14:05.144 --> 14:07.146
I know, junior.
I'm sorry.

14:07.279 --> 14:09.281
Some civilian got in the way.
Donnie will explain it to us.

14:09.782 --> 14:13.035
- He's around the corner.
He got lost.
- I wanted it to be over.

14:13.152 --> 14:16.155
I know.
Junior, mints?

14:26.549 --> 14:28.551
We've been standin'
around here forever.

14:28.551 --> 14:33.422
You don't think we got
better things to do?
What the fuck, man?

14:34.924 --> 14:37.426
They'll do it
fuckin' tomorrow.
My personal guarantee.

14:37.426 --> 14:40.429
Let me tell you something,
donnie. If they don't,

14:40.563 --> 14:43.566
some hikers are gonna
find your personal guarantee
rolled up in a tube...

14:43.682 --> 14:45.184
and shoved up your ass.

14:45.684 --> 14:48.687
Mike, they got blocked in.
There were witnesses.

14:48.687 --> 14:50.689
Tomorrow.
What did i just say?

14:50.689 --> 14:54.693
I already talked to them.
I realize it's urgent.

14:54.693 --> 14:57.696
I hear tony s's own mother
wants him popped.

14:57.696 --> 15:01.200
Who the fuck told you that?
- It was just a joke, right? -

15:01.584 --> 15:04.086
you think that's funny,
a guy's own mother?
Okay, okay.

15:04.336 --> 15:06.956
Tomorrow.
Fuckin' "a"!

15:09.592 --> 15:11.594
All right.

15:20.603 --> 15:24.106
I don't like it.
This fuckin' guy's big mouth.

15:24.106 --> 15:26.609
Nah, he's okay.
I don't like it.

15:27.109 --> 15:29.612
Next he'll be makin' jokes
about me.

15:32.231 --> 15:34.733
Chucky, tell him
to wait a minute.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.737
Yo, donnie,
hold on a minute.

15:41.240 --> 15:45.244
Hey, donnie. Sorry.

16:06.649 --> 16:11.353
- Are you still taking
the lithium?
- Lithium, prozac.

16:12.855 --> 16:16.859
When is it gonna end?
We're tryin' to give
a jolt to your system.

16:16.859 --> 16:20.362
Give it a, uh--
a little kick start.

16:20.362 --> 16:23.365
Why don't you kick me
in the fuckin' head?
What you're going through...

16:23.365 --> 16:25.367
is very painful,
i know that.

16:25.367 --> 16:28.120
You get stabbed in the ribs,
that's painful.

16:28.504 --> 16:32.124
This shit--
i don't feel nothin'.

16:32.124 --> 16:34.126
Nothin'.

16:34.126 --> 16:37.129
Dead. Empty.

16:41.383 --> 16:43.519
What else?

16:46.522 --> 16:49.775
- What?
- What were you just
thinkin' about then?

16:50.776 --> 16:53.779
This gorgeous
piece of cus.

16:53.779 --> 16:57.783
It's next door to cusamano's.
She's stayin' there
while they're away.

16:58.033 --> 17:02.905
- So you do feel something.
- Don't split hairs with me,
'cause i've had it with you.

17:02.905 --> 17:07.792
Like fuckin' king midas
in reverse here. Everything
i touch turns to shit.

17:08.042 --> 17:10.045
I'm not a husband
to my wife.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.664
I'm not a father
to my kids.

17:12.915 --> 17:15.917
I'm not a friend
to my friends.
I'm nothin'.

17:18.420 --> 17:20.923
I don't even know
why i come here.

17:22.925 --> 17:25.426
Nothin' else to do,
i guess.

17:25.426 --> 17:29.181
Do you think it would help
if you went someplace
so you could rest up a while?

17:29.181 --> 17:32.818
- Oh, you mean like vegas?
- No, not vegas.

17:32.818 --> 17:35.687
Someplace where you
could be looked after.
Like a hospital?

17:35.687 --> 17:40.692
- With the padded rooms
and the straitjackets?
- No. No straitjackets.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.694
A residential
treatment center.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.197
You got any idea what
my life would be worth...

17:45.197 --> 17:48.700
if certain people found out
i checked into
a laughing academy?

17:48.700 --> 17:52.838
- Your life is boxing us in.
- Well, i'll take a gun, and
i'll blow my fuckin' head off.

17:52.838 --> 17:56.208
If that's what you're saying,
then i think youshould
be hospitalized.

17:56.208 --> 17:59.711
Oh, yeah? Well, you get
a couple of guys, you come
to my house, you try it.

18:02.347 --> 18:04.349
All right.

18:05.851 --> 18:08.470
I'm gonna push the prozac
to 60 milligrams.

18:09.471 --> 18:11.723
Sure. Why not?

18:24.236 --> 18:26.738
Hey, is that you?

18:28.240 --> 18:31.743
Ciao.
Look who's here.

18:31.743 --> 18:35.747
I was just talkin'
about you. No kiddin'.
What are you doin' here?

18:35.747 --> 18:39.251
Oh, i have the class
in gum graftingalla scuola.
I just finish.

18:39.251 --> 18:43.255
Let me ask you.
This sandwich,

18:43.255 --> 18:45.257
it says it's a hero.

18:45.257 --> 18:47.259
Why do they call
a sandwich hero?

18:47.259 --> 18:50.762
You don't wanna
eat that. No.
No?

18:50.762 --> 18:53.265
Come on.
What's your name?

18:53.265 --> 18:56.768
Isabella.
I'm tony.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.771
You never went
in italy?
No.

18:59.771 --> 19:02.774
Why not?
You don't want to go?

19:02.774 --> 19:05.277
I guess i just
never got off my ass.

19:05.527 --> 19:07.913
- Excuse my french.
- Your french?

19:07.913 --> 19:10.782
- It's an expression.
- Oh.

19:12.284 --> 19:17.039
And where are your people from?
Wait a minute. Don't tell me.

19:21.043 --> 19:23.295
- Avellino?
- How'd you know that?

19:23.295 --> 19:25.681
I didn't.
I guess it.

19:25.681 --> 19:28.684
You look like this guy
from there.

19:28.684 --> 19:32.804
He came after
the "hearthquake" to repair--

19:32.804 --> 19:35.807
oh, how do you say?

19:35.807 --> 19:39.194
- The seat of the house?
- I love how you say that.

19:40.195 --> 19:43.565
- Hearthquake.
- You are making a joke.

19:43.565 --> 19:46.068
No. No, i'm sorry.

19:46.068 --> 19:48.070
Go ahead.

19:48.070 --> 19:51.707
Fondamenta.
You understand?
Fondamenta.

19:51.707 --> 19:53.825
- Foundation.
- Foundation, si.

19:53.825 --> 19:56.828
Foundation was cracked,
and he repaired the stone.

19:56.828 --> 19:59.831
My grandfather was a stone
mason. He was avellinese,
him and his brother.

20:00.332 --> 20:04.336
Tony, you should visit
avellino if your family
come from there.

20:04.336 --> 20:08.840
There isn't too much left
because of the many
hearthquake.

20:09.341 --> 20:14.346
But from the 17th century
is still there
a beautiful palazzo,

20:14.346 --> 20:16.348
palazza della donna.

20:16.348 --> 20:20.352
And there is a place in
the corner of the piazza...

20:20.852 --> 20:23.855
is a wine bar
you can sit.

20:23.855 --> 20:27.359
You can see the hills.
And when it's spring,

20:27.359 --> 20:31.747
you can smell
the blossoms
from the lemon tree.

20:31.747 --> 20:34.249
And there is a church
with a bell.

20:34.249 --> 20:37.753
And they say,
when it rings,

20:37.753 --> 20:40.255
that means
that the baby...

20:40.255 --> 20:44.259
was conceived
in the town.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.162
Tony?

21:22.164 --> 21:26.168
Tony?
Are you on medication?

21:26.168 --> 21:30.055
No. No.

21:34.059 --> 21:39.181
Tell me more about your,
uh-- your dental studies.

21:41.183 --> 21:44.686
I was interested mainly
in tumors...

21:44.686 --> 21:47.439
of the gum and
soft tissue of the mouth.

21:47.439 --> 21:49.941
Yeah?

21:49.941 --> 21:53.945
Tumors of the gum, huh? Wow.

21:54.196 --> 21:56.198
Dad, we're eating!

22:00.202 --> 22:02.204
Hold it, ma. Anthony.

22:02.704 --> 22:05.707
- What does a gentleman
do for a lady?
- In his own house?

22:05.707 --> 22:08.710
A young lady's invited anthony
to his very first formal, ma.

22:08.710 --> 22:10.712
Well, then.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.722
Okay?

22:20.722 --> 22:23.225
Thank you, young man.

22:26.228 --> 22:28.730
Okay.

22:28.730 --> 22:30.866
Tony!

22:32.734 --> 22:36.121
Honey, i told you
that your mother
was coming for dinner.

22:38.123 --> 22:42.127
Hi, ma.
Well, look who's
decided to join us.

22:42.127 --> 22:44.629
And with that breath!

22:47.132 --> 22:51.386
- You know, i don't really
need that right now, ma.
- Aren't we being sensitive?

22:51.386 --> 22:54.890
Meadow, can you take some
chicken and pass it, please?

22:56.391 --> 22:59.895
Where's uncle jun'?
He said
he wasn't feeling well.

22:59.895 --> 23:04.399
In its lifetime, the average
american chicken's feet
never even touch the ground?

23:04.399 --> 23:08.019
- That's dicked up.
- If i was that young lady...

23:08.019 --> 23:10.522
and you came and took me
to that dance...

23:10.522 --> 23:14.159
and used
that kind of talk,
i'd slap your face.

23:14.159 --> 23:16.661
That's right, ma.
Thank you.

23:16.661 --> 23:19.164
Well, the whole
world's gone crazy.

23:19.164 --> 23:22.417
Some woman in pennsylvania,
she shot her three children...

23:22.417 --> 23:25.036
and set her house
on fire.
Here we go.

23:25.036 --> 23:28.790
How come my son's
in a bathrobe?
Is he sick?

23:28.790 --> 23:30.792
- He's fine.
- Dad, you're depressed.

23:30.792 --> 23:34.429
Depressed? My father
came to this country...

23:34.930 --> 23:39.434
with 17 cents in his pocket,
and he never made a peep.
Ma.

23:39.684 --> 23:41.686
What's he got
to be depressed about?

23:41.686 --> 23:44.689
Nobody threwhim
into the glue factory...

23:44.689 --> 23:47.692
and soldhishouse
out from underneath him.

23:47.692 --> 23:52.197
Ma, we all agreed
we would sell your home.
I'm goin' back upstairs.

23:52.314 --> 23:56.818
I was making a joke.
Oh, i suppose it
would be better...

23:56.952 --> 23:58.954
if i never opened my mouth.

23:59.454 --> 24:02.207
Grandma, how can it be
a joke if you're crying?

24:02.207 --> 24:04.209
Oh, i mean, this is
really the last time.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.711
I am never coming back
to this house.

24:21.176 --> 24:24.179
What a day.
With this wind, huh?

24:24.179 --> 24:26.681
Whatcha lookin' at?
Oh, nothin'.

24:37.576 --> 24:40.579
Who's she?

24:40.579 --> 24:44.082
Dental student
from italy.

24:44.082 --> 24:46.084
You know her.

24:48.086 --> 24:50.589
We had lunch.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.591
Lunch?

24:54.092 --> 24:57.596
You fucking piece of shit.

24:57.596 --> 25:01.099
Going out to dinner with you
is a distant memory for me,

25:01.099 --> 25:04.603
but you have time
to take her to lunch?

25:04.603 --> 25:07.606
You are sinking
this whole family
into your misery...

25:08.106 --> 25:10.609
with your wallowing
and your complaining,

25:10.609 --> 25:14.112
while i spoon- feed you
and bathe you.

25:14.613 --> 25:18.617
All it takes is a half- inch
of another woman's thigh
to get your ass out of bed?

25:18.617 --> 25:20.619
What am i,
a fucking idiot?

25:21.119 --> 25:24.623
If i had an ounce
of self- respect,
i would cut your dick off!

25:32.714 --> 25:34.716
You know, i was there
last night for dinner.

25:35.217 --> 25:39.087
I couldn't go.
Those poor freakin' kids.

25:39.087 --> 25:41.089
Yeah, they barely have
a father now.

25:41.089 --> 25:43.091
You should see
the way he comes down
to the dinner table.

25:43.592 --> 25:46.845
- I don't wanna know.
- In his bathrobe
at 7:00 in the evening.

25:46.845 --> 25:49.848
Some bargain.
That's all anyone should
have to pay for a movie.

25:49.848 --> 25:53.735
My cousin cakey
after he had his lobotomy,
he looked exactly like my son.

25:54.236 --> 25:56.354
- Livia.
- Empty. A shell.

25:56.855 --> 25:58.857
Better cakey had died
than go on living like that.

25:59.357 --> 26:01.993
- That's what his own mother
always used to say.
- Don't talk about it anymore.

26:01.993 --> 26:04.996
I don't wanna hear
about it anymore. Don't
talk about tony. It's done.

26:26.268 --> 26:28.770
Mr. Tony, ms. Carmela
said to tell you...

26:28.770 --> 26:33.275
she went to new york
to buy a suit for a. J.

26:33.275 --> 26:35.777
Go away.
Okay.

26:35.777 --> 26:40.282
Ms. Carmela told me
to remind you of
your appointment.

27:10.312 --> 27:14.316
Hey, how
you doin', tony?
Pick six today?

27:14.316 --> 27:17.819
No, just an orange juice
and a racing form today.

27:23.325 --> 27:25.827
This wind, huh?
Yeah.

27:31.833 --> 27:34.336
Thanks. Take care.
Okay.

28:08.870 --> 28:11.373
- You dead now, motherfucker!
-

28:16.127 --> 28:18.129
aw, shit!

28:43.154 --> 28:46.574
Oh, my god, daddy.
Where is he?
Please let me be all right.

28:46.574 --> 28:48.943
They didn't say anything
when they called?
No, they didn't.

28:50.445 --> 28:52.947
Oh, tony.
Oh, my god.
Look who's here.

28:52.947 --> 28:55.450
Oh, my god, tony.
Is he all right?

28:55.450 --> 28:58.953
Jesus christ, tony.
Daddy, your ear's all bloody.
What'd they do to your ear?

28:59.454 --> 29:01.956
I'm just putting in
a few stitches
to create a nice closure.

29:01.956 --> 29:04.209
Oh, jesus,
we were so scared.

29:04.209 --> 29:06.211
They almost killed you
for a stupid car.

29:06.211 --> 29:08.713
Nobody told them about
the kind of gas mileage
that thing gets, huh, med?

29:09.214 --> 29:13.351
It's not funny, dad.
What's the matter
with you?

29:13.351 --> 29:15.970
Forget how to talk
'cause your old man
got banged up a little?

29:15.970 --> 29:18.857
- No.
-
he's just frightened, tony.

29:18.857 --> 29:22.360
The doctor needs
to finish up here, ma'am.

29:22.610 --> 29:24.612
Come on, kids.
Let's give
the doctor some room.

29:25.113 --> 29:27.232
- Come on.
- See ya later.

29:30.235 --> 29:32.237
Poor dad.
He'll be all right.

29:35.490 --> 29:38.626
Christ.

29:38.626 --> 29:41.629
You people can't wait
until they finish
sewing my ear back on?

29:41.629 --> 29:43.631
Face it, tony.
One inch to the left...

29:43.631 --> 29:46.000
and you're down in a drawer
instead of talking to me.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.002
Who's talkin' to you?

29:48.002 --> 29:50.889
- What's he doing here?
- Oh, agent harris
is just leaving.

29:51.389 --> 29:54.509
We're offering
your husband full
immunity from prosecution...

29:54.509 --> 29:56.511
in return for any testimony
that he might give us.

29:56.511 --> 30:00.648
We relocate you and your family.
You'll be completely safe,
all of you.

30:00.648 --> 30:03.651
- Hey, don't talk to me wife.
- So he wouldn't have to go
to jail either?

30:04.152 --> 30:06.154
Carmela, ask this prick
if i'm even indicted.

30:06.654 --> 30:09.524
This assassination problem
is not gonna go away. I think
both of you realize that.

30:09.908 --> 30:12.410
I told you
to stop talking to my wife.

30:12.911 --> 30:15.530
- Carmela, wait outside.
- Kiss my ass, tony.

30:16.030 --> 30:18.283
We're the only option
you have left, tony.

30:18.283 --> 30:21.286
It's not safe for you anymore
in the streets or in jail.
This conversation is over.

30:21.286 --> 30:25.673
- What do you know?
- He doesn't know anything.
It was a fuckin' carjacking.

30:25.673 --> 30:27.675
Now, get out!
You're upsetting
my wife!

30:27.675 --> 30:30.929
In case
you change your mind.

30:36.935 --> 30:39.554
- You know he's right, tony.
- Nothin's gonna happen.

30:39.554 --> 30:41.940
Wake up, tony!
It already did!

30:44.943 --> 30:48.813
- I took an oath, carmela.
- What are you, a kid
in a tree house?

30:48.813 --> 30:51.199
Did you ever tell anybody
about me gonna see melfi?

30:51.199 --> 30:54.452
Is that why they tried
to kill you? Because
you're seeing a psychiatrist?

30:54.452 --> 30:57.572
Look, what are you
talkin' about?
It was a carjacking.

30:57.572 --> 31:01.075
- At least have the decency
not to lie to me.
- What do you wanna do?

31:01.075 --> 31:05.079
You wanna move to utah?
Be mr. And mrs. Mike smith?

31:05.079 --> 31:09.083
We could sell some
indian relics by the road,
maybe start a rattlesnake ranch.

31:09.467 --> 31:13.471
This is our chance
to get out, tony.
We could start a whole new life.

31:13.721 --> 31:16.724
Have some mormons
over to dinner. Eat some
tomatoes that have no taste.

31:17.225 --> 31:19.727
You know what i want?
I want those kids
to have a father.

31:19.844 --> 31:22.480
They got one.
This one. Me.

31:22.981 --> 31:25.483
Tony soprano.
And all that comes with it.

31:25.850 --> 31:27.986
Oh, you prick.

31:31.105 --> 31:33.107
Mmm. Good.

31:37.111 --> 31:41.366
Probably i can't go
to that dance now either.
God, self- involved much?

31:45.620 --> 31:49.123
Hey, it's uncle silvio
and uncle paulie.
Hey, squirt.

31:49.123 --> 31:52.627
They shot my dad.
He's all right, though,
isn't he?

31:52.627 --> 31:57.131
Take more than a jamaican
bobsled team with cap guns
to stop your old man.

31:57.131 --> 31:59.133
Where is he?
With mom.

31:59.133 --> 32:01.135
All right.

32:08.142 --> 32:10.645
They look kinda weird.

32:14.649 --> 32:17.652
I don't believe
it was a carjacking.

32:23.658 --> 32:26.127
This afternoon in montclair,
anthony soprano,

32:26.127 --> 32:30.632
who allegedly holds the rank
of captain or higher in
the northern new jersey mafia,

32:30.632 --> 32:33.635
was wounded
in what the victim claims
was an attempted carjack,

32:34.135 --> 32:39.140
but sources in the f. B. I. Say
was a gangland execution
gone awry.

32:39.140 --> 32:43.645
Soprano escaped
with minor wounds and was taken
to an undisclosed area hospital.

32:44.145 --> 32:47.265
However, one of his assailants,
william johnson
"petite" clayborn,

32:47.265 --> 32:49.267
was fatally wounded
in the attack.

32:49.267 --> 32:51.769
Continuing now with--

32:52.270 --> 32:56.274
is this true?
Why, do you think
they made it up?

32:56.274 --> 32:59.777
But how- how could
this happen?

32:59.777 --> 33:02.780
I don't know.
I don't figure to know.

33:02.780 --> 33:05.283
I feel like
i'm floatin' in space.

33:05.283 --> 33:08.786
- He's gonna look
for who did this to him.
- Anthony? Of course he is.

33:08.786 --> 33:12.290
- Livia, you understand
what's goin' on here?
- My son got shot.

33:12.290 --> 33:14.792
- And he got away.
- What do we do now?

33:14.792 --> 33:18.296
- What the fuck
do we do now, livia?
- We go see him.

33:18.796 --> 33:24.302
- Tony?
- Of course! He's my only son.

33:25.803 --> 33:27.805
Thanks, sweetheart.

33:28.056 --> 33:31.559
We could use some peppers
out here, huh, carm?
I'll get'em, dad.

33:31.559 --> 33:34.062
Don't you have
like two hours
worth of homework to do?

33:34.062 --> 33:38.066
I can't help too?
Some fuckin' shit, huh?

33:38.066 --> 33:42.570
Tony!
Jesus fucking christ!
Oh!

33:42.570 --> 33:44.822
Who do we blame
for the hat?

33:45.206 --> 33:47.709
I was down the shore
at tom's river on
denny najarian's boat.

33:47.709 --> 33:50.211
Two shooters.
And his piece
was under the seat.

33:50.211 --> 33:53.715
- Do you believe this guy?
- Nah, two girls from
the hood, that's all.

33:54.215 --> 33:57.585
- Do we know who they are yet?
- The live one took off
in a taurus.

33:59.087 --> 34:02.590
Taurus?
Yeah, moolies
in a new taurus.

34:03.091 --> 34:05.093
Doesn't exactly fit
the profile.

34:05.593 --> 34:07.595
Motherfuck!
What?

34:07.845 --> 34:09.847
These guys
i had a beef with
at the newsstand.

34:09.847 --> 34:12.350
You were there?
Not yesterday.
The day before.

34:12.850 --> 34:15.353
The newsstand?
The one in montclair?

34:15.353 --> 34:18.989
- Yeah, yeah. I was,
uh, in the neighborhood.
- What were you doing there?

34:18.989 --> 34:21.993
- Uh, takin' my mother
to the doctor.
- Oh.

34:24.862 --> 34:27.364
Hey, put it
right there, baby.

34:27.364 --> 34:29.867
Thank you.

34:29.867 --> 34:34.371
Ah, this husband
of yours, carmela.
How much we love him.

34:34.371 --> 34:37.375
He's the best.
He's like a father to me.

34:39.377 --> 34:42.380
Just make sure
nothin' happens to him.

34:42.880 --> 34:46.884
- I'll get it. -

34:49.270 --> 34:51.773
come on.

34:51.773 --> 34:56.277
All due respect,
ton', it had to be
your uncle, right?

34:56.277 --> 34:59.280
Well, why fuckin' now?

34:59.280 --> 35:02.784
Maybe he found out.
Found out what?

35:02.784 --> 35:05.787
That he's joe jerk- off,
not the boss.

35:05.787 --> 35:09.290
That you been runnin'
things behind his back.
Anthony!

35:09.290 --> 35:11.292
Uncle jun'!

35:11.292 --> 35:13.911
Don't get up. I heard
your knee was fucked up.

35:13.911 --> 35:16.414
Don't worry, ma.
I'm all right. Come here.

35:16.914 --> 35:18.416
Your ear,
it's disfigured.
It's all right.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.918
Hi.

35:21.302 --> 35:24.806
I got mikey palmice,
all my crew out there,

35:24.806 --> 35:26.557
crackin' heads
to find out
who did this.

35:26.557 --> 35:30.061
When we're done with them,
they're gonna wish
they were never born.

35:30.061 --> 35:34.565
- Tony?
- Look who it is.
Father intintola.

35:34.565 --> 35:38.069
- I came as a friend.
How are you, tony?
- All right.

35:38.069 --> 35:43.074
If you'd like
to speak privately,
we could kneel in prayer--

35:43.074 --> 35:45.576
not right now.
Why don't you
grab a sandwich...

35:45.576 --> 35:48.579
and we'll talk later.

35:48.579 --> 35:52.083
- You're sleepin' over, right?
- Uh, can i get anybody
anything?

35:52.083 --> 35:54.585
Sil, maybe
another sambuca.
Hey, i'll get it, carm.

35:54.585 --> 35:57.088
I'll take a curacao
if you got it.
I'll buy him one too.

35:57.088 --> 35:59.340
No, that's all right.
No alcohol for me.

35:59.841 --> 36:01.592
Can he hear
through that ear?

36:01.592 --> 36:05.963
Ma, sit down.
Here you go.
Have something to eat.

36:10.968 --> 36:14.722
- Want some?
- Fuck it. I thought
for sure it was him.

36:14.722 --> 36:17.725
But there he is,
glasses and all.

36:19.227 --> 36:22.230
Don't eat capicollo, grandma.
It's nothin' but fat
and nitrates.

36:22.230 --> 36:24.232
Capicollo.
Over here.

36:27.485 --> 36:29.987
- Look at that face.
- Who is that?

36:29.987 --> 36:31.989
- Who?
- That girl.

36:31.989 --> 36:35.993
- Who, meadow?
- Who is she?
Is that concetta?

36:35.993 --> 36:37.995
That's your granddaughter.
Meadow?

36:37.995 --> 36:41.499
All right.
Don't get impatient.
I'm your mother.

36:41.499 --> 36:45.753
Hey, grandma, did you hear?
Dad fought off two black guys.
One got shot in the head.

36:45.753 --> 36:48.256
Anthony, what time is it?
Why aren't you dressed
for the dance?

36:48.639 --> 36:50.141
- I can't go.
- Why not?

36:50.641 --> 36:53.644
- Don't you need me here?
- And disappoint the future
miss new jersey?

36:53.644 --> 36:56.647
- Get outta here.
- Well, mom was going to drive
us. She can't now, right?

36:57.148 --> 36:59.650
You're gonna go.

37:50.952 --> 37:52.954
I gotta know something.

37:53.454 --> 37:55.456
And i want the truth.

37:59.460 --> 38:01.963
Did you ever tell anybody
about you and me?

38:04.465 --> 38:07.969
I may have
mentioned something
to my immediate family...

38:07.969 --> 38:09.971
that i had a patient
who was in some trouble...

38:09.971 --> 38:13.474
with all the stuff
we were hearing about
in the news.

38:14.475 --> 38:17.979
I never mentioned a name
or any other specifics...

38:17.979 --> 38:20.982
that could identify you
as that person.

38:33.995 --> 38:36.864
My son's.

38:39.867 --> 38:41.869
Does your family know?

38:44.372 --> 38:47.875
My mother's made a few comments.
But i don't see how she knows.

38:48.376 --> 38:49.877
And if she did--

38:54.632 --> 38:57.635
hey, don't even go there
about the old lady.

39:00.388 --> 39:04.141
You should've seen her
at my house after what happened.
She was losin' her fuckin' mind.

39:06.143 --> 39:08.529
How are you doing
with all of this?

39:13.034 --> 39:16.537
Tell you the truth,
i feel pretty good.
Yeah.
Really?

39:16.537 --> 39:21.042
Well, that's good.
Talk about
a jolt to the system.

39:21.042 --> 39:24.045
Try gettin' shot at.
It'll give you
a nice kick start.

39:31.552 --> 39:35.056
You know,
when i was depressed,

39:35.556 --> 39:37.558
i said i didn't wanna live.

39:41.062 --> 39:44.065
Well, i'll tell you somethin'.

39:44.065 --> 39:46.567
I didn't wanna die.

39:47.068 --> 39:50.571
Every fuckin' particle
of my bein' was
fightin' to live.

39:56.577 --> 39:59.580
- I had lunch with that girl
next door, you know.
- You did?

39:59.580 --> 40:01.582
Isabella.

40:04.585 --> 40:08.089
She was tellin' me
about the avellino,

40:08.589 --> 40:10.591
where my--
where my people are from.

40:10.591 --> 40:12.593
It sounded nice.

40:12.593 --> 40:16.097
Anyway, she was talkin',
and, uh,

40:16.097 --> 40:18.599
all of a sudden--

40:21.102 --> 40:23.104
you know, uh,

40:23.104 --> 40:28.109
we went
to another place,
like, in my mind's eye.

40:28.109 --> 40:33.614
I don't know.
We went back in time
to like 1907 or somethin'.

40:35.616 --> 40:38.619
And we were in this room,
you know.

40:40.621 --> 40:43.124
And she had this baby.
She was holdin' it, you know.

40:43.624 --> 40:45.126
On her breast,
she was nursin' it.

40:45.626 --> 40:47.628
She was whisperin'
to it, like,

40:47.628 --> 40:53.134
"it's okay, little baby.
Don't cry. It's gonna
be okay. I love you."

40:56.137 --> 41:00.641
- Did the baby have a name?
- She was calling it antonio.

41:02.643 --> 41:07.148
Anthony, your fantasy.
That's-- that's you,
that little baby.

41:07.148 --> 41:11.152
And isabella.
That she was nursingyou.

41:19.660 --> 41:22.663
Oh, fuck me.

42:02.203 --> 42:04.705
You think
this is a stretch?

42:19.220 --> 42:21.222
Hey, can we get
some of that whiskey?

42:28.596 --> 42:31.098
Livia.
You don't knock?

42:31.098 --> 42:34.735
- I could've been in the nude.
- What the hell is going on?

42:34.735 --> 42:38.105
- Look and see
if my slipper is over there.
- Fuck your slipper!

42:38.105 --> 42:40.608
I don't like that talk.

42:40.608 --> 42:44.995
Was was that bullshit
yesterday? You don't even
recognize your granddaughter?

42:46.997 --> 42:51.502
Well, i-- i've-- i've been
forgetting things lately.

42:52.002 --> 42:56.507
You'll-- you'll find
that it'll happen
to you soon too.

42:56.507 --> 43:01.011
That's terrific timing.
Right after the move on your son
goes in the toilet.

43:01.011 --> 43:03.514
I don't know
what you're talking about.

43:15.643 --> 43:19.146
Hey, cooze. Cooze.

43:21.148 --> 43:23.150
How was bermuda?

43:23.150 --> 43:26.153
Jeannie, she wrecked up
her motorbike.
She hurt her ankle pretty bad.

43:26.153 --> 43:28.155
Oh, yeah?
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Thanks.

43:28.155 --> 43:31.158
So where's your...
dental student?

43:31.158 --> 43:33.160
Where's my what?

43:33.661 --> 43:36.046
Isabella.
I haven't seen her
in a couple of days.

43:36.046 --> 43:39.049
Come on.
Your houseguest. Isabella.

43:39.550 --> 43:43.053
Dark hair, beautiful.

43:43.053 --> 43:47.558
- You don't know what the fuck
i'm talkin' about, do you?
- I got no idea.

43:48.058 --> 43:52.062
You didn't have
an italian girl--
she's here studying the--

43:52.313 --> 43:56.066
we had skippy palumbo from
down the street come into the
house to take care of the dog.

43:58.068 --> 44:00.571
Never mind. Forget it.

44:00.571 --> 44:04.074
It's a joke.
I'll talk to you later.

44:04.575 --> 44:06.577
All right.

44:14.084 --> 44:17.087
You sure about this?
You're not pulling
my leg?

44:17.087 --> 44:20.591
What am i, an idiot?
Of course i'm sure.

44:20.591 --> 44:23.093
You never--
no.

44:23.093 --> 44:25.095
Frankly, i think
i've said enough about it.

44:25.095 --> 44:28.098
I never threatened
to cut your dick off.

44:40.527 --> 44:42.529
Hello?
Yeah, it's your patient.

44:42.896 --> 44:45.399
The one who's been
involved in a few things
in the news lately?

44:45.783 --> 44:47.785
I gotta talk to you.
What's wrong?

44:47.785 --> 44:51.288
There was no isabella.
What?

44:51.288 --> 44:54.792
There was no isabella.
I just talked to cusamano.

44:54.792 --> 44:57.294
Him and the whosits
just got back
from bermuda.

44:57.795 --> 45:00.297
I asked him,"where's
the dental exchange student
that's stayin' at your house?"

45:00.798 --> 45:03.917
- He looked at me
like i was fuckin'pazzo.
- You said your wife saw her.

45:04.418 --> 45:08.055
- You both argued about it.
- Yeah, i asked her about that.

45:08.172 --> 45:10.174
And?
You thought
she was pissed then?

45:10.307 --> 45:13.310
You should see her now,
now that i told her the whole
thing was just a fantasy.

45:14.812 --> 45:17.815
- Discontinue the lithium.
- I already flushed it.

45:18.065 --> 45:22.436
Even if it was the medicine,
this fantasy of yours
has meaning.

45:22.569 --> 45:27.574
You know, the issue
of mother and child,
the madonna.

45:27.574 --> 45:29.693
You didn't see this broad.

45:29.693 --> 45:32.696
Did you ever flirt
or come on sexually
with isabella?

45:32.696 --> 45:35.082
No.
Why not?

45:35.082 --> 45:39.586
You said she was
very beautiful and voluptuous.
Another question.

45:39.586 --> 45:43.090
- Why now?
- What do you mean?

45:43.207 --> 45:46.093
Why the need for the fantasy
of a loving, caring woman now?

45:48.595 --> 45:52.349
- I don't know.
- I think you should come in
so we could talk face- to- face.

45:52.349 --> 45:55.352
- I can't right now.
- You know, your mother
is always...

45:55.352 --> 45:58.222
talking about infanticide.

45:58.222 --> 46:00.224
Yeah, it's a sad situation
that goes on in the world.

46:00.607 --> 46:04.611
- Are you still feeling okay?
- I feel pretty good, actually.

46:04.611 --> 46:09.116
When i find out
who took a shot at me,
i'm gonna feel even better.
