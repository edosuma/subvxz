KLAUS: <i>Previously on</i> "The Originals"...

00:02.846 --> 00:06.534
FREYA: If this prophecy is fulfilled,
you will all fall.

00:06.564 --> 00:07.608
FREYA: One by friend,

00:07.638 --> 00:10.355
one by foe, and one by family.

00:10.357 --> 00:13.713
- Please Nik, just kill me.
- Not with the only one who loves you

00:13.743 --> 00:15.862
- rotting at the bottom of the ocean.
- No.

00:15.892 --> 00:18.277
VINCENT: You kill a witch, you
lose your place among the witches.

00:18.307 --> 00:20.971
For what you've done, you need to be
shunned. I'm sorry, Davina.

00:21.001 --> 00:23.790
St. James is the one place
where magic doesn't work.

00:23.820 --> 00:26.204
VINCENT: Davina, I'm recording
this here because magic

00:26.206 --> 00:28.282
is our enemy.

00:28.312 --> 00:31.142
The Ancestors are forcing me
to help Lucien Castle.

00:31.144 --> 00:34.801
I have everything I need
to become what I deserve to be.

00:34.831 --> 00:36.048
You want to become an Original.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.288
LUCIEN: I intend to be an upgrade.

00:38.318 --> 00:39.287
HAYLEY: Lucien's venom

00:39.317 --> 00:41.291
is derived from all seven packs.

00:41.321 --> 00:44.153
Giving him a bite
that not even I can cure.

00:44.183 --> 00:45.368
(Gunshots)

00:45.398 --> 00:47.197
FREYA: He wanted you to kill him.

00:47.227 --> 00:49.144
You helped him take the final step.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.319
The Ancestors are manipulating
Kol. They couldn't get to me,

00:52.349 --> 00:54.104
so they're making him lose control.

00:54.134 --> 00:55.300
There are two vials of serum,

00:55.302 --> 00:56.668
and he only drank one.

00:56.698 --> 00:58.146
He made enough for two.

00:58.176 --> 00:59.133
Aurora.

00:59.163 --> 01:00.697
She's gone.

01:06.788 --> 01:08.183
(Sighs)

01:08.723 --> 01:10.136
(Thuds)

01:10.166 --> 01:12.333
Enjoying yourself, luv?

01:14.053 --> 01:15.665
I feel like a brand-new woman.

01:15.695 --> 01:16.603
(Laughs)

01:16.633 --> 01:18.759
What a lovely choice of words.

01:19.459 --> 01:22.396
This setting reminds me
of the time we were in Paris.

01:22.426 --> 01:24.184
1903?

01:24.214 --> 01:25.964
La Belle Epoque.

01:25.966 --> 01:27.882
Peace, prosperity.

01:27.884 --> 01:29.494
- Hope...
‭- Oh, so is this your intention?

01:29.524 --> 01:32.404
Ply me with champagne and then
entice me with nostalgia?

01:32.434 --> 01:34.906
I simply desired an auspicious location

01:34.908 --> 01:37.250
for us to begin a new adventure.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.316
Perhaps,

01:38.346 --> 01:40.090
centuries from now,

01:40.120 --> 01:42.581
you and I will look back
at this bucolic scene

01:42.583 --> 01:45.800
as the beginning of our chapter.

01:45.830 --> 01:47.819
And what does that chapter entail?

01:47.849 --> 01:49.397
Power,

01:49.427 --> 01:51.306
domination...

01:52.626 --> 01:53.758
vengeance.

01:54.966 --> 01:56.460
Men are such good talkers,

01:56.490 --> 01:59.099
but how rarely they produce
more than words.

01:59.129 --> 02:00.094
(Laughs)

02:00.124 --> 02:01.738
And they call me delusional.

02:01.768 --> 02:04.069
Your wit is as sharp as ever.

02:04.099 --> 02:07.097
Nik is the fool who let you slip away.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.377
And while that loss
is punishment enough,

02:09.407 --> 02:12.682
rest assured, I will heap
more suffering upon his head.

02:12.712 --> 02:14.679
You cannot defeat Niklaus, Lucien.

02:14.681 --> 02:17.098
He is and always has been your better.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.772
(Chuckles)

02:18.802 --> 02:20.976
I am altogether different now.

02:25.892 --> 02:27.675
Blood of a Mikaelson witch,

02:27.677 --> 02:29.427
imbued with dark magic.

02:29.429 --> 02:34.098
This has transformed me
into something new

02:34.100 --> 02:38.019
with a power unlike anything
the world has ever seen.

02:39.606 --> 02:41.656
My bite is lethal,

02:41.658 --> 02:43.992
even to a Mikaelson.

02:45.412 --> 02:47.862
Is this more of your boasting, Lucien?

02:47.864 --> 02:50.748
Oh, no. It can all be verified
easily enough.

02:50.750 --> 02:52.367
Just ask poor Finn.

02:52.369 --> 02:54.702
Oh, wait. You can't. I killed him.

02:55.789 --> 02:57.255
The rest of his brothers

02:57.257 --> 02:58.623
shall follow soon enough,

02:58.625 --> 03:00.458
as the prophecy has stated.

03:01.845 --> 03:04.012
But first...

03:04.014 --> 03:07.048
I wanted to make you this offer.

03:07.050 --> 03:09.100
(Sighs)

03:09.102 --> 03:11.803
My proposal is simple.

03:11.805 --> 03:13.855
Join me, Aurora.

03:13.857 --> 03:16.691
Drink this, become what I am,

03:16.693 --> 03:20.195
and let us spend the rest
of our immortal lives together.

03:20.197 --> 03:22.436
In exchange, you will have

03:22.466 --> 03:24.766
my undying love.

03:25.540 --> 03:27.719
And all the revenge you could desire.

03:30.315 --> 03:32.807
I would accept your offer,

03:32.809 --> 03:34.943
but I fear I could not enjoy your love

03:34.945 --> 03:38.563
or my revenge as long as
my brother suffers.

03:38.565 --> 03:41.566
Then allow me this further promise.

03:41.568 --> 03:43.902
Say yes,

03:43.904 --> 03:47.238
and by the end of day,
you shall have Tristan back.

03:48.542 --> 03:51.993
Or I will relieve his suffering
by killing Elijah.

(Sighs)

04:16.173 --> 04:17.485
You're hovering.

04:17.487 --> 04:20.103
I'm supervising. How else
to speed up your endeavors?

04:20.106 --> 04:22.072
Let's see. Perhaps
I should bring Vincent here.

04:22.075 --> 04:24.409
Force him to aid you
by removing his legs.

04:24.411 --> 04:26.578
Vincent doesn't know
how to kill Lucien, either.

04:26.580 --> 04:29.164
Besides, if he leaves the St. James,

04:29.166 --> 04:30.949
who knows what the Ancestors
will make him do next.

04:30.951 --> 04:33.952
Ancestors are thoroughly
occupied, according to Davina,

04:33.954 --> 04:35.420
terrorizing our brother Kol.

04:35.422 --> 04:36.871
What a surprise. Another day,

04:36.873 --> 04:38.706
another witch-inspired vendetta.

04:38.708 --> 04:40.258
Well, Davina can take care
of Kol for now.

04:40.260 --> 04:42.899
Let us focus our energies on Lucien.

04:42.929 --> 04:44.684
How do we demolish that rodent?

04:45.134 --> 04:46.240
(Sighs)

04:46.270 --> 04:47.432
I'm working on it.

04:47.434 --> 04:49.434
Yes. While we all
have our roles to play,

04:49.436 --> 04:52.687
Elijah can stay here and oversee
whatever it is Freya's doing.

04:52.689 --> 04:54.689
I'm going to actually
accomplish something.

04:54.691 --> 04:55.773
ELIJAH: Brother, accomplishing
something...

04:55.775 --> 04:58.810

This is a bad idea.

05:28.008 --> 05:29.340
Magic won't affect you in here,

05:29.342 --> 05:30.758
so step inside.

05:34.349 --> 05:36.064

No. You were wise

Losing a sibling is awful.

06:51.508 --> 06:55.093
Yes. Well, I'll find solace
when Lucien is dead.

06:55.095 --> 06:57.595
And what about Aurora?

06:57.597 --> 06:58.930
It's bad enough

06:58.932 --> 07:00.481
that Lucien's bite could kill you.

Yeah, well, it's hard to recall

09:51.245 --> 09:54.030

10:02.340 --> 10:04.423
What's the point of these questions?

10:06.878 --> 10:09.545
The Ancestors made a deal with Lucien.

10:11.215 --> 10:12.515
That's an act of war.

10:12.517 --> 10:14.216

10:15.386 --> 10:17.269

I could convince them

10:17.271 --> 10:18.288
that's there's a better way.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.189

is avoid trouble and protect their own.

10:29.817 --> 10:32.234
(Chuckles)

10:32.236 --> 10:34.620
I remember coming to Music Days
when I was a kid.

10:34.622 --> 10:37.573
I-I remember all the covens
gathering together.

10:37.575 --> 10:40.242
And no matter what your beef was
with somebody else,

10:40.244 --> 10:42.578
well, that one day it was all good.

10:42.580 --> 10:44.213
And you could feel the presence

10:44.215 --> 10:45.748
of all those that came before.

10:45.750 --> 10:47.800
You could feel 'em watching.

10:47.802 --> 10:50.052
Peaceful.

10:50.054 --> 10:52.254
Now, ever since vampires
took over this city,

10:52.256 --> 10:54.723
those same spirits have been restless.

10:54.725 --> 10:55.925
And the covens will never know peace

10:55.927 --> 10:57.593
with the Mikaelsons living here.

10:57.595 --> 11:01.097
Now, my guess is the Ancestors
see Lucien as a weapon.

11:02.350 --> 11:04.150
Use him on vampires, right?

11:04.152 --> 11:07.486
Use him on the family that begot them.

11:07.488 --> 11:09.405
And if we're gonna stop that,
somebody's gotta

11:09.407 --> 11:11.157
convince the Ancestors
there's a better way.

11:12.773 --> 11:13.710
Why would you

11:13.740 --> 11:15.915
- ever help me?
- This isn't about you.

11:15.945 --> 11:17.446
It's about Davina.

11:19.117 --> 11:21.500

11:27.507 --> 11:29.875
Freya, are we out of time.

to its most potent form.

11:35.850 --> 11:37.383
If I combine the right elements

11:37.385 --> 11:38.934
we'll have a chance at stopping Lucien,

11:38.936 --> 11:40.719
and if I don't...

11:40.721 --> 11:44.846
- (Knocking)
‭- CAMI: Elijah, somebody!

11:45.860 --> 11:47.143
What's wrong?

11:47.145 --> 11:48.811
- It's Klaus... Lucien has him.
- Freya!

11:48.813 --> 11:50.029
Invite her in.

11:50.031 --> 11:52.314
Yeah, come in, you're invited.

11:55.286 --> 11:57.286
Tell us what happened.

11:57.288 --> 11:58.737
Lucien ambushed him.

11:58.739 --> 12:00.656
He knocked him around
like it was nothing.

12:00.658 --> 12:01.657
Did he bite him?

12:01.659 --> 12:03.159
No. I think he wanted him alive.

12:03.161 --> 12:04.460
I followed them.

12:04.462 --> 12:06.662
Lucien took Klaus back to the penthouse.

12:07.548 --> 12:09.165
(Phone buzzing)

12:11.856 --> 12:14.386
Lucien is demanding my presence

12:14.388 --> 12:15.838
at the Whiskey Cask.

12:16.196 --> 12:18.340
Alone and immediately.

12:19.310 --> 12:20.509
He says if I delay,

12:20.511 --> 12:22.394
Niklaus will die.

12:22.396 --> 12:23.679
(Screaming)

12:25.266 --> 12:26.765
(Grunting)

12:31.355 --> 12:33.022
That does look uncomfortable.

12:35.526 --> 12:36.408
Is it too tight?

12:36.410 --> 12:38.799
AURORA: No, I think it fits just fine.

12:38.829 --> 12:40.279
Those chains and that wood

12:40.281 --> 12:41.697
were crafted by Ancient Egyptians

12:41.699 --> 12:44.700
keen on suppressing all sorts of evil.

12:44.702 --> 12:47.086
Nothing supernatural can escape.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.652
Not even you.

12:49.823 --> 12:52.091
You see, I've been stockpiling

12:52.093 --> 12:55.911
such items for a long, long time.

12:55.913 --> 12:58.747
Planning this moment for centuries.

13:00.092 --> 13:02.218
Tell me, how does it feel,

13:02.220 --> 13:05.087
knowing you've been outdone
by your better?

13:05.089 --> 13:07.423
You think you're my better?

13:08.214 --> 13:09.802
I think your upgrade

13:09.832 --> 13:11.760
has infected your head,

13:11.762 --> 13:13.429
made you as delusional as her.

13:13.431 --> 13:15.931
At least now you're truly a pair.

13:15.933 --> 13:17.600
I'll be sure to scatter both your ashes

13:17.602 --> 13:19.082
in the same patch of bog.

13:19.112 --> 13:20.071
(Gasps)

13:20.101 --> 13:20.992
(Grunts)

13:21.022 --> 13:23.194
- Is that a hint of fear in his voice?
‭- Yeah.

13:23.224 --> 13:26.525
Usually your taunts and threats
are so much more convincing.

13:26.527 --> 13:28.183
(Grunts)

13:28.213 --> 13:30.563
I think he's beaten, my darling.

13:32.539 --> 13:34.567
Just not yet broken.

13:35.766 --> 13:38.571
But then we're just getting started.

13:38.573 --> 13:41.073
All I have to do...

13:41.075 --> 13:43.042
is take this

13:44.011 --> 13:46.745
and then I too shall be your better.

13:48.299 --> 13:51.717
Have you any idea what torment
you'll endure then

13:51.719 --> 13:54.253
for what you did to my brother...

13:56.257 --> 13:57.840
and to me?

14:01.206 --> 14:03.067
(Chuckles)

14:03.097 --> 14:04.980
I will take

14:04.982 --> 14:08.767
such exquisite joy

14:08.769 --> 14:10.986
in killing you myself.

14:11.939 --> 14:13.155
(Growls)

14:13.157 --> 14:14.440
Well, clearly,

14:14.442 --> 14:16.442
you two have much to discuss.

14:16.444 --> 14:18.694
So, if you'll excuse me,

14:18.696 --> 14:21.330
I have business elsewhere.

14:29.457 --> 14:32.508
Now, darling,

14:32.510 --> 14:34.510
you may have your fun.

14:34.512 --> 14:36.795
But please keep Nik alive.

14:36.797 --> 14:40.382
I would so hate to miss his death.

14:49.213 --> 14:51.477
(Door opens)

14:54.344 --> 14:56.315
Are you seriously going out there?

14:57.318 --> 14:58.870
I'm seriously going out there.

14:58.900 --> 15:01.203
Elijah, the whole point of putting
the deed to the compound

15:01.205 --> 15:04.245
in Freya's name was to make
this place impenetrable.

15:04.275 --> 15:06.914
Now you're gonna pick a fight
with a guy who can kill you?

15:07.215 --> 15:09.612
Yes, when you put it that way...

15:09.614 --> 15:11.497
it does sound a little reckless.

15:11.499 --> 15:13.165
Elijah.

15:15.753 --> 15:18.203
Be careful.

15:24.762 --> 15:28.013
All right, I know you're
listening to me.

15:28.839 --> 15:31.767
You wanted me to be the regent
of the nine covens.

15:31.769 --> 15:34.553
You believed that I could
lead our people.

15:34.555 --> 15:36.472
But how am I supposed to be a leader

15:36.474 --> 15:38.298
when you keep jerking me around
like I'm a damn puppet

15:38.328 --> 15:39.760
or something?

15:40.457 --> 15:43.145
I need you to talk to me.

15:49.370 --> 15:50.903
They won't answer you.

15:53.997 --> 15:56.375
Van Nguyen.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.662
All grown up, I see.

15:59.664 --> 16:01.080
Not that it matters, man.

16:01.082 --> 16:02.581
This ain't got nothing to do with you.

16:02.583 --> 16:04.510
Actually, it does.

16:04.746 --> 16:07.920
Seem, my mom's
one of the Ancestors now.

16:07.922 --> 16:10.556
Dead, thanks to your friend Davina.

16:10.558 --> 16:12.675
You know, the traitor
you've been sneaking around with

16:12.677 --> 16:14.265
even though she was shunned?

16:14.295 --> 16:16.178
Some regent you turned out to be.

16:16.180 --> 16:17.150
Well...

16:17.231 --> 16:19.065
No wonder the Ancestors
want you out.

16:19.067 --> 16:21.468
Oh, so, you speak for the
Ancestors now, is that it?

16:21.498 --> 16:24.270
Why don't you ask the Ancestors
why they trust Lucien Castle,

16:24.272 --> 16:26.238
a vampire who's done nothing
but lie and kill ever since

16:26.240 --> 16:27.857
he set foot in New Orleans.

16:27.859 --> 16:29.942
He killed a Mikaelson,
which is more than you ever did.

16:29.944 --> 16:31.861
Oh, come on, man,
I'm trying to keep the peace.

16:31.863 --> 16:33.946
And what the Ancestors
want to do will start a war.

16:33.948 --> 16:37.366
A war that the covens
are gonna win, thanks to me.

16:39.904 --> 16:41.737
Your time as regent is over.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.372
The witches are gonna
take back the city.

16:43.374 --> 16:45.786
Step one:

16:46.225 --> 16:47.043
new management.

16:47.045 --> 16:48.327
Passus doulè trèt...

16:49.497 --> 16:52.131
(Scoffs)

16:52.133 --> 16:53.249
So...

16:53.251 --> 16:55.084
starting now,

16:55.086 --> 16:56.752
I'm the regent!

16:59.445 --> 17:00.723
I wonder, when you decided

17:00.725 --> 17:03.008
to brick me into that dreadful tomb,

17:03.010 --> 17:04.760
did it ever occur to you that our roles

17:04.762 --> 17:07.762
might one day be reversed?

17:07.765 --> 17:10.766
We both know that I buried you alive

17:10.768 --> 17:13.935
because I could not
bring myself to kill you.

17:13.938 --> 17:16.105
(Chuckles)
No doubt you intended to free me

17:16.107 --> 17:17.772
after a suitable period of time.

17:17.775 --> 17:21.036
In fact, my methods were not
unlike Tristan's, after all.

17:21.066 --> 17:22.340
Did he not hide you away

17:22.371 --> 17:23.945
in a mountain monastery?

17:25.998 --> 17:28.834
The truth is I still had hopes for us.

17:30.145 --> 17:32.316
Oh...

17:33.925 --> 17:37.009
Your affections for me
must run deep, indeed.

17:38.566 --> 17:39.852
Tell me...

17:39.882 --> 17:42.798
if I were to kiss you now,

17:42.800 --> 17:45.518
would you feel those affections stir?

17:48.582 --> 17:50.473
Because I would feel nothing.

17:54.103 --> 17:55.902
Are you so certain?

17:57.260 --> 17:59.315
We are flames

17:59.317 --> 18:02.318
in the darkness of each other's worlds.

18:02.320 --> 18:05.988
We burn brighter together
than we ever did alone.

18:10.958 --> 18:13.796
And I would forgive everything

18:14.961 --> 18:17.217
if you would only forgive me,

18:17.247 --> 18:18.945
my love.

18:20.622 --> 18:23.085
(Laughs)

18:25.378 --> 18:28.775
Wow, you really are quite
desperate, aren't you?

18:30.515 --> 18:31.897
I mean, it's quite pathetic, seeing you

18:31.899 --> 18:34.517
resort to this failed seduction.

18:34.519 --> 18:36.268
I mean, it's comical, even.

18:36.270 --> 18:39.002
And yet you would entertain
Lucien's brazen advances?

18:39.032 --> 18:39.913
Well...

18:39.943 --> 18:42.491
Do you really think you
could ever love that imbecile?

18:43.973 --> 18:46.028
Oh... Poor, sweet Lucien.

18:46.849 --> 18:48.197
After all these years he still remains

18:48.199 --> 18:50.416
such a dedicated suitor.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.451
Such a shame I'll never see him

18:52.453 --> 18:54.837
as more than a means to an end.

18:54.839 --> 18:56.789
But if he wants to save my brother

18:56.791 --> 18:59.291
in a bid to win my heart,
why shouldn't I let him?

18:59.931 --> 19:01.594
Wouldn't be the first
of his gifts I've accepted.

19:01.596 --> 19:03.379
After all...

19:07.385 --> 19:09.218
he gave me this.

19:09.220 --> 19:11.220
The means to remake myself.

19:11.648 --> 19:13.639
So that I might become
a creature of such pure

19:13.641 --> 19:15.641
and unbridled power

19:16.001 --> 19:18.036
that I can kill even you.

19:19.698 --> 19:22.195
Whatever has passed between us,

19:22.405 --> 19:24.174
whatever hatred

19:24.204 --> 19:25.728
you're holding on to,

19:25.758 --> 19:28.737
in me you see the kindred
you have always

19:28.739 --> 19:30.128
longed for.

19:30.158 --> 19:32.024
To spend an eternity without me...

19:32.345 --> 19:35.194
it would be a curse your
frail heart could not endure.

19:35.446 --> 19:37.112
You're wrong.

19:38.282 --> 19:39.415
You see, Nik,

19:39.417 --> 19:41.450
whatever terrors may await me

19:41.452 --> 19:42.657

pale in comparison

19:45.690 --> 19:47.856
in ending you.

Hmm. Or your death,

21:08.281 --> 21:10.031
to relieve his suffering.

21:10.033 --> 21:13.734
So, either tell me how to find him

21:13.980 --> 21:16.454

Darling, how would you
like to watch me burn?

That way you have the
thrill of watching me rise

21:25.364 --> 21:27.503
from the ashes like a phoenix, reborn.

21:27.533 --> 21:29.022
A lovely image.

But I think you might
ruin Lucien's carpet.

21:31.888 --> 21:33.721

torture me a bit more

free, what then? Kill me?

me into Lucien's equal?

21:45.768 --> 21:46.768

21:47.186 --> 21:49.692
Not the wisest strategy
for your survival.

21:50.424 --> 21:52.024
Is this what you want?

21:52.959 --> 21:54.531

already substantial misery.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.114
Either turn it into anger
or leave it at the door.

23:24.116 --> 23:27.835
But either way, you
control your emotions.

23:29.642 --> 23:32.790
Which means you're already
one step ahead of Aurora.

23:38.130 --> 23:40.297
Hey, I have an idea.

23:44.327 --> 23:45.327
Elijah,

23:46.355 --> 23:49.523
I've asked you a rather
important question.

23:49.525 --> 23:51.525
Given our current circumstance,

23:51.527 --> 23:54.083
you'd be wise not to test my patience.

23:54.113 --> 23:55.113
So...

23:56.745 --> 23:58.616
Tristan's resting place...

23:58.618 --> 24:01.585
You carefully craft yourself
into this abomination

24:01.587 --> 24:03.037
purely to become...

24:04.757 --> 24:06.841
an errand boy to that banshee?

24:06.843 --> 24:07.843
(Chuckles)

24:09.035 --> 24:11.462
Oh, you Mikaelsons.

24:11.953 --> 24:14.965
Your arrogance truly knows no bounds.

24:14.967 --> 24:16.967
Do I need to remind you

24:16.969 --> 24:19.603
the prophecy is on my side?

24:20.104 --> 24:21.639
Your family is doomed.

24:21.641 --> 24:24.108
So if you'll give me Tristan's location,

24:24.110 --> 24:26.026
at least I could make your death quick.

24:26.028 --> 24:29.780
I have no idea where he is.

24:29.782 --> 24:31.982
But, you know, Lucien,

24:31.984 --> 24:35.612
the thing is that I suspect

24:35.642 --> 24:38.038
you don't even really care.

24:42.850 --> 24:43.828
Mm.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.580
I never really liked him.

24:47.017 --> 24:48.227
(Sighs)

24:48.257 --> 24:51.502
But at least I can tell Aurora I tried.

24:54.674 --> 25:00.678
♪ And give me a dream or two... ♪

25:00.680 --> 25:01.680
(Chuckles)

25:04.684 --> 25:06.517
We're gonna be okay.

25:06.519 --> 25:08.519
We've already made it through so much.

25:08.521 --> 25:11.322
Once we deal with the Ancestors,
we'll have that date you wanted.

25:12.503 --> 25:14.131
♪ This game ♪

25:14.161 --> 25:18.195

25:31.928 --> 25:32.928

25:33.763 --> 25:34.763
(Panting)

25:39.218 --> 25:40.218
(Clinking)

25:42.355 --> 25:43.823
You said that magic
doesn't work in here.

25:43.853 --> 25:47.057
The Ancestors are breaking through the
spell. We don't have much time.

25:47.059 --> 25:48.275
(Crack)

25:48.277 --> 25:49.894
Sorry to interrupt date night.

25:50.511 --> 25:51.812
What are you doing?

25:51.814 --> 25:54.398
I'm preventing a bloodbath
in the middle of my city,

25:54.400 --> 25:56.233
and I'm freeing you up to help Vincent.

25:56.235 --> 25:58.035
He's in trouble at the cemetery. Go.

25:58.037 --> 25:59.570
I'll clear this place out.

25:59.572 --> 26:01.405
(Sighs)

26:04.638 --> 26:06.210
You give me my brother.

26:06.212 --> 26:07.628
(Chuckles)

26:07.630 --> 26:08.630
(Panting)

26:09.432 --> 26:11.081
I won't ask you again.

26:11.292 --> 26:13.500
Please, Elijah.

26:13.745 --> 26:15.753
Know when you're beaten.

26:24.730 --> 26:25.730
(Shouting)

26:29.018 --> 26:30.150
(Grunting, panting)

26:30.152 --> 26:32.353
Oh. That looks like it hurts.

26:32.355 --> 26:34.822
- (Shouts)
- That's what I was going for.

26:34.824 --> 26:38.943
(Panting): What... did you do to me?

26:38.945 --> 26:41.779
The Sigil will bind you,

26:41.781 --> 26:43.113
weaken you.

26:43.115 --> 26:44.915
The boiling blood I added myself.

26:44.917 --> 26:46.533
(Panting)

26:46.535 --> 26:48.285
Maybe I can't kill you,

26:48.287 --> 26:50.955
but I can make you wish you were dead.

26:50.957 --> 26:52.423
(Growls)

26:52.425 --> 26:55.676
(Panting, groaning)

26:55.936 --> 26:58.629
That's it? Nothing more to say?

26:59.710 --> 27:02.349
No more taunts tripping
from your tongue?

27:02.926 --> 27:06.053
Well, then I suppose
it's time I finish this.

27:06.055 --> 27:07.055
(Grunts)

27:08.248 --> 27:09.495
What are you doing?

27:09.525 --> 27:11.308
I'm gonna drive this into my heart,

27:11.310 --> 27:13.310
die, and be reborn.

27:14.795 --> 27:17.197
And then, with the aid
of my newfound power...

27:19.568 --> 27:21.986
I'm going to silence you permanently.

27:23.039 --> 27:24.039
(Panting)

27:26.826 --> 27:28.376
(Elevator bell dings)

27:28.995 --> 27:30.545
(Elevator doors open)

27:32.434 --> 27:33.434
Well,

27:34.230 --> 27:36.050
it appears we have company.

27:36.052 --> 27:37.052
(Panting)

27:42.341 --> 27:43.507
(Gasps)

27:44.728 --> 27:46.548
Oh, my.

27:47.632 --> 27:49.982
This day just gets better and better.

27:58.994 --> 28:00.332
Cami, it's been a while.

28:00.362 --> 28:02.195
How's vampirism treating you?

28:02.621 --> 28:04.197
As a matter of fact, I'm enjoying it.

28:05.066 --> 28:06.416
That's why I'm here,

28:06.418 --> 28:09.336
to express my gratitude.

28:09.338 --> 28:11.238
Ooh, you cheeky little minx.

28:12.525 --> 28:13.673
Have you come to have a go at me?

28:13.675 --> 28:14.591
Get out of here, Camille!

28:14.593 --> 28:16.101
Shut up, Nik.

28:16.131 --> 28:17.916
This is between us girls.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.195
Though I suppose I will let you

28:19.197 --> 28:21.197
listen to her cries as I tear off

28:21.199 --> 28:24.117
her limbs like the wings
of pretty little butterfly.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.285
I'd like to see you try.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.541
Ooh! You're brandishing

28:26.571 --> 28:28.421
your antiques at me.

28:28.423 --> 28:29.923
I suppose I would be scared

28:29.925 --> 28:31.791
if I thought you were
quick enough to use them.

28:32.832 --> 28:33.832
(Chuckles)

28:34.342 --> 28:37.347
You really did not think
this through, did you?

28:37.349 --> 28:39.493
Actually, we did.

28:39.523 --> 28:40.772
(Elevator bell dings)

28:40.802 --> 28:41.802
(Grunting)

28:45.090 --> 28:46.039
(Gasps)

28:46.041 --> 28:47.541
- Stop!
- (Exhales)

28:48.460 --> 28:50.260
She drank the serum.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.461
(Growls)

28:51.463 --> 28:52.763
(Grunts, laughs)

28:53.632 --> 28:54.632
(Grunts)

28:54.850 --> 28:55.850
(Panting)

28:57.887 --> 28:58.858
(Crack)

28:58.888 --> 29:00.188
(Aurora panting)

29:12.568 --> 29:13.568
(Panting)

29:15.218 --> 29:16.403
That should help.

29:17.391 --> 29:18.777
I suggest you drink up,

29:18.807 --> 29:21.207
before you do something you'll regret.

29:21.987 --> 29:22.987
Mmm.

29:38.406 --> 29:39.993
VINCENT: Davina! No!

29:40.395 --> 29:41.894
Don't touch that.

29:41.896 --> 29:42.776
What is it?

29:42.806 --> 29:46.271
That is a very dangerous spell,

29:46.301 --> 29:48.501
courtesy of your old friend Van Nguyen.

29:48.503 --> 29:50.503
The Ancestors made him regent.

29:50.948 --> 29:53.390
And they're about to make their move.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.008
They're coming after Kol next.

29:55.977 --> 29:57.644
Once all six candles are lit,

29:57.646 --> 29:59.235
we can kiss our neutral zone good-bye.

29:59.265 --> 30:01.453
If they get to Kol, he won't be able
to control himself.

30:01.483 --> 30:02.603
We need to stop this now.

30:02.633 --> 30:05.791
Davina, I don't have access to
the Ancestors' power anymore.

30:05.821 --> 30:07.120
Neither do I.

30:07.755 --> 30:09.755
But we can channel each other.

30:14.916 --> 30:15.916
(Sighs)

30:19.084 --> 30:21.218
Anpae kata sispann dife.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.336
Anpae kata sispann dife.

30:24.162 --> 30:26.139
BOTH: Anpae kata sispann dife.

30:26.141 --> 30:27.141
(Panting)

30:27.759 --> 30:29.809
Thanks for the appetizer, mate.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.294
Now I best be on my way.

30:31.296 --> 30:32.414
Oh, I can't let you do that.

30:32.444 --> 30:33.668
My family is under attack.

30:33.698 --> 30:35.031
Davina might be in trouble.

30:35.033 --> 30:36.438
I am not letting you anywhere near her.

30:36.468 --> 30:37.990
All right? Not while you're like this.

30:38.020 --> 30:38.969
(Grunts)

30:38.971 --> 30:40.921
BOTH: Anpae kata sispann dife.

30:41.193 --> 30:43.140
Anpae kata sispann dife.

30:44.404 --> 30:46.987
Listen to me, Kol. All right?
I never much liked you

30:47.017 --> 30:49.563
on a good day, but you
are clearly not yourself.

30:49.565 --> 30:51.098
Tell me you can't feel that.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.149
(Growls)

30:52.151 --> 30:54.267
BOTH: Anpae kata sispann dife.

30:54.269 --> 30:58.321
Anpae kata sispann dife.

30:58.323 --> 31:01.491
The Ancestors are doing this to
you, and they're not gonna stop.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.243
All right, you have to
get out of this city,

31:03.245 --> 31:05.112
somewhere where they can't reach you.

31:05.114 --> 31:09.116
The longer you stay, the more
dangerous you are to everyone.

31:09.118 --> 31:11.284
- Including Davina.
- ‭(Growls)

31:11.286 --> 31:12.869

31:31.968 --> 31:33.690
You have to believe me, Marcel.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.025
(Exhales)

31:35.027 --> 31:36.724
I would never,

31:37.132 --> 31:39.363
never hurt Davina.

31:39.393 --> 31:40.393
(Exhales)

31:41.011 --> 31:43.700
If that's true, then do the right thing.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.819
(Panting)

31:46.147 --> 31:47.147
Go.

31:48.378 --> 31:49.990
And don't come back.

31:58.911 --> 32:00.844
(Growling)

32:04.016 --> 32:05.516
(Screaming, moaning)

32:08.687 --> 32:09.687
(Panting)

32:12.524 --> 32:13.690
Whew! (Chuckles)

32:14.381 --> 32:15.492
Well, I admit, Freya,

32:15.494 --> 32:18.328
this is a truly valiant effort.

32:18.330 --> 32:21.698
Inspired, I assume, by your
grief over Finn's demise?

32:22.084 --> 32:23.116
(Screams)

32:23.118 --> 32:24.701
Pop goes the weasel!

32:24.703 --> 32:26.386
Oh! (Chuckles)

32:26.388 --> 32:28.672
A rather potent aneurysm spell.

32:29.189 --> 32:31.091
You never fail to impress.

32:31.093 --> 32:33.877
Oh, I have all kinds of tricks.

32:34.939 --> 32:36.713
We even brought an audience

32:36.715 --> 32:38.115
to enjoy the show.

32:39.051 --> 32:40.051
(Growls)

32:40.552 --> 32:42.052
Oh, come now, my darling sister.

32:42.054 --> 32:44.521
The Strix are the show.
Well, the first act.

32:44.523 --> 32:47.891
Act two, Lucien's buried
beneath 1,000 tons of cement.

32:47.893 --> 32:50.227
Act three... spoiler alert...

32:50.229 --> 32:51.735
you're a parking lot.

32:51.765 --> 32:52.726
(Chuckles)

32:52.756 --> 32:54.397
Oh, even after 1,000 years,

32:54.399 --> 32:56.867
you've never managed
to curb your hubris.

32:57.209 --> 33:01.238
You still wander through a smog
of your own self-importance.

33:02.457 --> 33:04.124
I can kill anything.

33:04.126 --> 33:06.543
Even them. Even you.

33:06.907 --> 33:11.164
And since the Ancestors have
made me their champion...

33:11.166 --> 33:12.249
(Chuckles)

33:13.181 --> 33:14.301
they will not allow me

33:14.303 --> 33:15.752
to be detained.

33:16.585 --> 33:18.235
(Indistinct whispering)

33:30.435 --> 33:32.349
Nik, what a conundrum.

33:32.788 --> 33:35.405
Mother of your child over here,

33:35.407 --> 33:38.575
woman of your dreams over here.

33:41.109 --> 33:42.879
Which one should I kill first?

33:42.881 --> 33:44.715
I'm the one who betrayed you.

33:44.717 --> 33:46.633
I'm the one you hate.

33:46.635 --> 33:48.251
And they're the ones you care for.

33:48.253 --> 33:50.087
So what a pleasure for me to watch

33:50.089 --> 33:52.639
your face as I rip them apart.

33:52.641 --> 33:56.426
Hey. I'm right here, ready and waiting.

33:56.428 --> 33:59.262
Oh, Cami, the hero was
never a good look on you.

33:59.264 --> 34:01.481
Trembling and helpless
is more your style.

Cami, did Nik ever
mention to you what happens

34:11.243 --> 34:14.610
when a vampire goes into a room
without being invited?

35:14.173 --> 35:15.222
(Screams)

35:15.224 --> 35:16.506
- (Panting)
- ‭Darling,

35:16.508 --> 35:19.676
I almost feel sorry for you.

35:19.678 --> 35:21.645
Blinded by love as I once was,

35:21.647 --> 35:24.231
ready to give everything,
even your life, for one who is

35:24.233 --> 35:27.851
and always will be unworthy.

35:27.853 --> 35:29.236
(Grunts)

35:29.238 --> 35:30.270
(Shouts)

35:30.272 --> 35:31.272
(Grunting)

35:35.077 --> 35:35.942
HAYLEY: Cami,

35:35.944 --> 35:36.743
now.

35:38.997 --> 35:40.097
(Whimpering)

35:48.743 --> 35:50.293
Good night, sunshine.

35:57.516 --> 35:58.516
(Chuckles)

36:10.127 --> 36:12.628
(Footsteps approaching)

36:17.725 --> 36:19.885
Where's Kol? Is he okay?

36:20.444 --> 36:21.594
He's gone, D.

36:22.887 --> 36:24.766
What? Why?

36:24.796 --> 36:26.926
I-I stopped Van's spell.
It's safe for him here now.

36:27.328 --> 36:29.795
But it's not a permanent solution.

36:29.797 --> 36:32.131
You'll find one. I know you will.

36:32.133 --> 36:36.836
But until then, Kol had
to leave to keep you safe.

36:37.908 --> 36:38.908
No.

36:39.841 --> 36:41.507
- (Crying)
- Listen,

36:41.509 --> 36:43.643
I have known the guy
for almost two centuries,

36:43.645 --> 36:45.895
and this is the first
time that he has ever done

36:45.897 --> 36:47.847
the right thing.

36:49.438 --> 36:50.438
(Crying)

36:53.017 --> 36:54.292
(Whispering): It's okay.

36:54.322 --> 36:55.872
I know.

36:55.874 --> 36:56.874
(Sniffles)

37:01.713 --> 37:03.212
(Hissing, panting)

37:03.214 --> 37:04.664
(Heartbeat echoing)

37:06.835 --> 37:08.085
(Phone ringing)

37:16.177 --> 37:18.845
♪ ♪

37:24.185 --> 37:25.635

(Elevator bell dings)

38:26.214 --> 38:29.131
Do you really think you
could ever love that imbecile?

38:29.133 --> 38:33.302
AURORA: Aw. Poor, sweet Lucien.

38:33.304 --> 38:37.139
After all this time, he
remains such a dedicated suitor.

38:37.927 --> 38:41.627
Such a shame I'll never see him
as more than a means to an end.

38:48.688 --> 38:49.986
KLAUS: Mission accomplished.

38:49.988 --> 38:52.576
And it only took you
the better part of a day.

38:52.606 --> 38:54.656
Do you want the chains back on?

38:54.658 --> 38:56.742
ELIJAH: You'd be doing
us all a marvelous favor.

38:56.744 --> 38:58.327
Perhaps you could fasten
something to his mouth.

38:58.329 --> 39:00.779
Aurora's still out cold.

39:00.781 --> 39:02.614
What are the chances
of keeping her that way?

39:02.616 --> 39:05.284
Oh, my spell will keep her down
long enough to use the serum

39:05.286 --> 39:07.859
in her blood to figure out how
to kill both her and Lucien.

39:07.889 --> 39:10.422
I must say, I'm rather
looking forward to it.

39:10.877 --> 39:12.127
You're welcome.

39:13.473 --> 39:16.395
I suppose I ought to
be thanking you as well.

39:16.397 --> 39:18.898
- You can thank me in diaper duty.
- (Chuckles)

39:18.900 --> 39:21.100
Although, while you're
on the grateful train,

39:21.102 --> 39:22.568
you should probably hit up Cami.

39:23.293 --> 39:25.319
I believe Camille
prefers I leave her alone.

39:25.349 --> 39:27.740
Oh, please, Klaus. Did you see

39:27.742 --> 39:30.192
what she went through to save your ass?

39:31.872 --> 39:36.916
Cami may tell you that staying
away is best... and maybe it is...

39:37.778 --> 39:39.978
but it doesn't stop how she feels.

39:55.438 --> 39:56.438
(Knocking)

40:01.716 --> 40:03.716
You were quite the hero today.

40:04.839 --> 40:05.978
I'm sorry,

40:05.980 --> 40:09.180
did I get in the way of
your big, bad revenge scheme?

40:10.784 --> 40:12.184
You can't come in.

40:12.586 --> 40:15.621
No, of course not. You're a vampire now.

40:15.623 --> 40:18.049
The lease would be in
someone else's name.

40:18.079 --> 40:19.434
Good night, Lucien.

40:19.464 --> 40:22.164
Of course, you'd want
that person close by,

40:23.600 --> 40:24.343
in case...

40:24.373 --> 40:27.049
a friend popped by for tea.

40:27.051 --> 40:29.635
Neighbors are close by.

40:30.242 --> 40:31.963
Of course, it couldn't just be any
neighbor. It'd have to be someone

40:31.993 --> 40:33.893
whose presence was reliable.

40:33.923 --> 40:36.391
Perhaps someone who worked from home.

40:36.393 --> 40:39.895
Not Gregory on the fourth floor.
He's moving out next month.

40:39.897 --> 40:43.148
Or Laticia, 7-B. She's agoraphobic.

40:44.252 --> 40:45.252
But...

40:46.726 --> 40:47.726
Stephanie,

40:48.673 --> 40:50.756
- just down the hall...
- You leave her alone.

40:50.758 --> 40:52.258
Well, that's going to be difficult,

40:52.260 --> 40:54.343
seeing as I've already killed her.

40:55.313 --> 40:56.645
So, you see,

40:56.647 --> 40:58.647
I can come in.

41:05.690 --> 41:06.690
(Panting)

41:07.408 --> 41:08.412
(Clattering)

41:08.442 --> 41:09.442
