01:10.475 --> 01:11.775
What are you doing?

01:11.810 --> 01:15.613
Caught me. I was eating
into the profits.

01:15.647 --> 01:18.716
I told you to leave the load,
pick it up in two hours.

01:18.750 --> 01:20.784
Sorry. I'm on my way. Wait.

01:22.554 --> 01:24.021
Boss wants to meet you first.

01:24.055 --> 01:25.089
Sure.

01:25.123 --> 01:27.257
Come on.

01:38.637 --> 01:40.504
Get on your knees.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.913
Don't.

01:49.948 --> 01:51.448
Please.

01:55.086 --> 01:57.095
I can forget about it.

01:57.096 --> 01:59.857
Put your hands up.

01:59.891 --> 02:01.959
Boss wants to see if you can catch.

02:13.238 --> 02:14.738
Somebody's here.

03:01.986 --> 03:06.190
Maura, you're staring
at Chuck's biceps.

03:06.224 --> 03:06.996
I am.

03:06.997 --> 03:08.564
Females are wired to be attracted

03:08.598 --> 03:10.332
to the strongest,
most dominant males.

03:10.366 --> 03:12.201
It's natural selection at work.

03:13.354 --> 03:16.257
You're making me
uncomfortable. Stop.

03:16.258 --> 03:19.361
What? I'm just appreciating
his sternocleidomastoid.

03:20.353 --> 03:22.002
Excuse me.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.815
You have beautifully
developed musculature.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.124
What, am I embarrassing you?

03:29.158 --> 03:32.086
No, not at all. Why don't you
tell him he's got a nice ass, too?

03:32.895 --> 03:35.597
And a wonderfully
proportioned gluteus maximus.

03:37.099 --> 03:39.134
I am never working
out with you again.

03:40.070 --> 03:41.617
Right.

03:41.838 --> 03:43.538
Hey, where you going?
That was only 20 minutes.

03:43.573 --> 03:45.307
Oh, Bass is ill.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.742
He won't even eat
any organic spinach.

03:47.743 --> 03:48.827
I got to go check on him.

03:48.828 --> 03:50.111
You brought your turtle to work?

03:50.146 --> 03:51.397
Tortoise.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.248
I couldn't get his usual caregiver.

03:58.054 --> 03:59.387
Rizzoli.

03:59.422 --> 04:00.555
Hey, it's Murray.

04:00.590 --> 04:03.291
Hey...Murray. What's up?

04:03.326 --> 04:05.494
Can't find your parents
about the head count.

04:05.528 --> 04:07.462
Figure they must be at church.

04:08.102 --> 04:09.798
Head count for what?

04:09.832 --> 04:11.132
The surprise party.

04:11.746 --> 04:13.641
Surprise party for who?

04:13.642 --> 04:14.960
"Whom."

04:14.961 --> 04:16.904
Shh. What are you talking about?

04:16.939 --> 04:19.406
Oh, I thought you knew.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.711
Sorry, didn't mean to bother you.

04:25.362 --> 04:27.816
Too late, I'm bothered.

04:30.653 --> 04:32.354
Frankie?

04:32.388 --> 04:34.055
What? Hey.

04:34.724 --> 04:38.059
Know anything about ma and pop
throwing a surprise party today?

04:38.094 --> 04:40.462
Oh, no.

04:40.496 --> 04:43.465
"Oh, no" is right.

04:49.872 --> 04:50.939
What is this?

04:50.973 --> 04:53.174
Cups. You wanted cups.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.677
Why can't you ever do what I ask?

04:55.711 --> 04:57.479
They were 70% off, Ang.

04:58.771 --> 05:01.722
I wanted the toile ones,

05:01.723 --> 05:04.351
with the blue-and-green pattern.

05:04.352 --> 05:07.318
It's a cup, Ang. It's a cup!

05:07.319 --> 05:09.375
Sorry about that call.
I think they wanted to surprise you.

05:09.376 --> 05:10.268
Uh-huh. Yeah.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.601
Surprise.

05:12.352 --> 05:15.087
I couldn't reach you.
What are you doing?

05:15.121 --> 05:16.956
We're gonna have a
family get-together,

05:16.990 --> 05:19.258
and I was gonna call you
the minute we were set up.

05:20.215 --> 05:24.183
Really? Pop, you want
to, uh, spit it out.

05:24.459 --> 05:26.556
Uh, ask your mother.

05:31.137 --> 05:32.505
He's coming home?

05:32.539 --> 05:34.240
He's getting out today.

05:34.274 --> 05:35.674
Bus gets in at 2:00.

05:35.709 --> 05:37.176
He's getting out early?

05:37.210 --> 05:38.611
For good behavior.

05:38.645 --> 05:42.181
Oh. Too bad he can't behave
unless he's behind bars.

05:42.215 --> 05:44.416
Don't say that about your brother.

05:44.451 --> 05:46.886
He made a mistake.
He served his time.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.487
Everybody makes mistakes, Jane.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.523
Running a priest
down in a crosswalk

05:50.557 --> 05:53.192
on your third D.U.I.
conviction is not a "mistake."

05:54.294 --> 05:56.862
Father Crowley has forgiven him.

05:56.897 --> 05:58.466
Why can't you?

05:58.467 --> 06:01.100
You're throwing him a party
in a bar, mom. Are you crazy?

06:01.648 --> 06:03.836
Technically, we're a bar and grill.

06:03.870 --> 06:05.604
And we're only serving soda pop.

06:05.639 --> 06:07.439
I thought that was
just till the cake.

06:07.474 --> 06:09.108
Murray.

06:11.403 --> 06:13.746
What makes you think he's
gonna make it out here?

06:13.780 --> 06:15.180
Easy, Jane. Take it easy.

06:15.215 --> 06:17.016
She's right.
You have to have a plan.

06:17.050 --> 06:19.251
He comes back, he works for me.

06:19.286 --> 06:20.986
Oh, and he sleeps in his bunk bed

06:21.021 --> 06:22.688
and plays with his toy soldiers.

06:22.722 --> 06:24.456
Yeah, that ought to
straighten him right out, pop.

06:24.491 --> 06:27.293
That's my son, and
it's your brother.

06:28.562 --> 06:31.430
Look, if you and Frankie
don't want to come, don't.

06:31.464 --> 06:33.566
Fine. Not coming.

06:34.271 --> 06:35.641
Me either.

06:35.642 --> 06:37.469
You're gonna turn your
back on this family?

06:37.504 --> 06:38.581
Come on, ma.

06:38.582 --> 06:40.627
Ma. Ma, we're both cops.

06:40.628 --> 06:42.669
You can't expect us to do this.

06:43.789 --> 06:45.436
Rizzoli.

06:46.479 --> 06:48.914
What?

06:48.949 --> 06:50.616
What? Oh, no.

06:50.650 --> 06:53.118
Okay. What happened?

06:53.629 --> 06:55.702
We got a cop shot.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.069
Danny Clark, drug control unit.

07:10.103 --> 07:12.137
He was in my class at the academy.

07:13.235 --> 07:15.107
Wife, two kids.

07:15.141 --> 07:17.810
Knew his father. I knew Danny
since he was this tall.

07:17.844 --> 07:19.778
It's a damn shame.

07:24.173 --> 07:26.218
One shot to the head.

07:26.252 --> 07:28.587
Looks like a large-caliber firearm.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.944
It's a 45-caliber.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.827
Abrasions on his sternum.

07:44.204 --> 07:45.842
And some hair's missing.

07:51.077 --> 07:53.245
There's a piece of tape. Hey, Joe.

07:53.279 --> 07:55.514
Uh, photograph this, mark
it, and bag it, okay?

07:55.548 --> 07:57.650
He was wearing a wire.

07:57.684 --> 07:59.985
He was working for us.

08:00.020 --> 08:01.420
Homicide?

08:01.454 --> 08:03.422
Yeah. Since when?

08:03.456 --> 08:05.090
I sent him under to get information

08:05.125 --> 08:07.760
about the two dead truckers from
Charlestown you were working.

08:07.794 --> 08:09.460
My case? Without telling me?

08:09.461 --> 08:11.133
It's my decision.

08:14.801 --> 08:17.241
Everyone fall in over here.

08:17.242 --> 08:19.058
What the hell?

08:21.241 --> 08:22.608
Move.

08:29.726 --> 08:31.416
I want every cop and detective

08:31.417 --> 08:33.687
down here working
the streets on this.

08:33.688 --> 08:35.589
Get everyone from headquarters.

08:35.623 --> 08:38.111
The only cop I want there
is Manning the front desk

08:38.111 --> 08:39.410
until further notice.

08:39.446 --> 08:42.448
You. You!

08:42.482 --> 08:44.567
If you'd kept us together on
this, Danny wouldn't be dead.

08:44.568 --> 08:47.052
Come on, easy, easy.
He wouldn't be dead!

08:49.089 --> 08:52.124
You better have a good reason
for sending him in alone.

08:52.158 --> 08:53.892
A good reason.

08:53.927 --> 08:55.360
Bobby.

08:58.943 --> 09:01.311
Look, I need you, Rizzoli.

09:01.312 --> 09:02.234
Yes, sir.

09:02.268 --> 09:03.535
I want you to interview Bobby.

09:03.570 --> 09:05.003
He may not even know what he knows.

09:06.439 --> 09:08.207
Now, you're the best at this.

09:08.241 --> 09:09.541
Take him to headquarters.

09:09.576 --> 09:11.043
I-I can interview him here.

09:11.077 --> 09:13.712
No, no, no, no.
Get him out of here.

09:13.746 --> 09:15.614
Yes, sir.

09:28.161 --> 09:30.062
I know. I know.

09:31.664 --> 09:34.233
Jane. Yeah?

09:34.267 --> 09:36.301
That's the only thing I
found in his pockets.

09:36.336 --> 09:38.036
Okay.

09:38.071 --> 09:41.406
I'll, uh... I'll bag it
and get it to evidence.

09:43.109 --> 09:45.377
Frankie, you want to...?

09:45.411 --> 09:47.980
Hey, man, come on, come on.
Let's... let's go.

09:48.014 --> 09:49.047
Okay?

09:54.154 --> 09:56.221
Ugh! Sunday.

09:56.256 --> 09:58.190
What? No, no, no. No, no, no.

09:58.224 --> 09:59.958
$20's, uh, overkill.

09:59.993 --> 10:02.995
You're only a jerk if you
don't leave anything. Here.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.937
God, when was that made? November?

10:09.669 --> 10:12.838
Marino wants a cup of coffee.
There's none upstairs.

10:12.872 --> 10:14.765
Guy's a wreck.

10:14.766 --> 10:16.237
I've tried everything...

10:16.238 --> 10:18.977
British strawberries,
Fennel,  Bok Choy.

10:19.854 --> 10:22.981
Are... are we in the
same conversation?

10:23.016 --> 10:25.817
Sorry. I-I was talking about bass.

10:25.852 --> 10:28.320
Oh. You're obsessing
over your turtle again?

10:28.354 --> 10:29.655
Tortoise.

10:31.024 --> 10:33.592
He likes salt in his coffee?

10:37.063 --> 10:38.219
Oh, damn it.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.564
You know, when people lock
their keys in their car

10:40.565 --> 10:41.972
or sprain their ankle,

10:41.973 --> 10:44.715
usually indicates that something
significant is bothering them.

10:44.716 --> 10:46.851
Yeah. A cop was murdered.

10:47.364 --> 10:48.707
Yeah. But that's...

10:48.708 --> 10:50.988
That's not why you're
salting your coffee.

10:54.826 --> 10:56.827
It's my brother Tommy.

10:58.597 --> 10:59.997
I always wondered about him.

11:00.032 --> 11:02.133
Well, Frankie and I became cops.

11:02.167 --> 11:05.403
And Tommy went to prison for
hitting a priest in a crosswalk.

11:05.437 --> 11:06.904
Oh.

11:06.939 --> 11:09.640
It was his third strike while
driving under the influence.

11:09.675 --> 11:10.741
Your poor parents.

11:10.776 --> 11:12.677
And, you know, they keep saying,

11:12.711 --> 11:14.412
"if the priest that he
hit has forgiven him,

11:14.446 --> 11:15.513
then why can't we?"

11:15.547 --> 11:16.647
This isn't about forgiveness.

11:16.682 --> 11:19.116
You know, Tommy is -
is really troubled.

11:19.151 --> 11:21.385
And the more they deny it,
the more he screws up.

11:22.179 --> 11:23.721
You really care about him.

11:23.755 --> 11:25.723
I just think that we
need to face reality.

11:25.757 --> 11:27.124
You know, Tommy needs help.

11:27.159 --> 11:29.360
This isn't like he broke
his leg and it'll heal.

11:29.394 --> 11:31.963
I'm really sorry.

11:33.732 --> 11:35.199
Thank you.

11:35.234 --> 11:37.134
Don't worry about it. Come on.

11:37.169 --> 11:39.337
We got too much to do today
to worry about Tommy.

11:48.447 --> 11:49.947
You wish you were out there?

11:49.982 --> 11:51.415
Yeah.

11:51.450 --> 11:53.217
We'll get the shooter.

11:55.670 --> 11:57.855
I'll call you as soon
as I get the results.

11:58.615 --> 11:59.757
All right.

12:01.960 --> 12:05.429
Oh, I got to log
this into evidence.

12:05.464 --> 12:08.733
I got to take this to Marino.

12:08.767 --> 12:10.201
I'll see you later.

12:10.235 --> 12:12.370
Jane. Yeah?

12:12.404 --> 12:14.105
If you want to talk
about your brother...

12:14.139 --> 12:17.408
Or just avoid the
subject, I'm here.

12:18.365 --> 12:19.580
I know.

12:30.155 --> 12:31.622
According to Danny's notes,

12:31.657 --> 12:34.325
you guys were making inroads
into the trucker homicides.

12:35.266 --> 12:36.993
Why'd you stop working the case?

12:39.364 --> 12:41.198
Cavanaugh pulled
me off the murders.

12:42.534 --> 12:44.435
Went back to working
drugs in Charlestown.

12:47.306 --> 12:49.915
And then there's -
there's nothing.

12:50.858 --> 12:53.611
Do you know what was Danny
doing for Cavanaugh?

12:53.645 --> 12:54.745
Beats me.

12:57.816 --> 12:59.417
Got real secretive all of a sudden.

12:59.451 --> 13:01.185
What? You guys were
partners for years.

13:01.219 --> 13:02.486
Why would he shut you out?

13:02.521 --> 13:06.324
We were partners for nine years.

13:06.358 --> 13:08.292
Danny was the best.

13:09.961 --> 13:12.763
But...

13:16.301 --> 13:19.804
I mean, you worked drugs.
You know what it's like.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.009
All that money's...

13:25.043 --> 13:27.978
Well, I knew Danny, too, Bobby.
What are you trying to say?

13:32.851 --> 13:35.853
Hey. Help me out here.

13:36.518 --> 13:39.323
I think Danny was dirty.

13:41.860 --> 13:43.527
Jane.

13:43.562 --> 13:44.929
Yeah?

13:44.963 --> 13:46.630
Sector six officers
brought in a woman

13:46.665 --> 13:48.632
they arrested outside the
warehouse last night.

13:48.667 --> 13:50.401
What, where Danny was shot?

13:50.435 --> 13:52.670
Yep. They grabbed her for crack.

13:52.704 --> 13:55.306
She says that she can
give up the shooter.

13:55.340 --> 13:57.742
If we broom her case?

13:57.776 --> 13:59.076
Yeah.

13:59.111 --> 14:01.679
She's waiting in
the interview room.

14:02.472 --> 14:05.249
Okay.

14:05.283 --> 14:06.717
Want me to go talk to her?

14:06.752 --> 14:07.885
Yeah, yeah. All right.

14:07.919 --> 14:09.221
Okay, I'll be right back.

14:09.222 --> 14:11.422
Bobby. Hey.

14:13.959 --> 14:15.693
Did you see his face?

14:15.727 --> 14:16.927
I'm not saying anything

14:16.962 --> 14:18.759
until I know that
I'm not doing time.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.399
You withhold information about
the murder of a Boston cop,

14:21.433 --> 14:24.483
and you're going back -
no trial, no nothing.

14:24.484 --> 14:26.036
You'll be eating dinner in jail.

14:26.071 --> 14:28.839
He was a cop? I didn't know
that he was a cop, okay?

14:28.874 --> 14:30.941
This is bad. This is really bad.

14:30.976 --> 14:32.009
This is so bad!

14:32.043 --> 14:34.078
Sit down. You're
not going anywhere.

14:34.112 --> 14:36.013
Did you see his face?

14:36.762 --> 14:38.090
Yeah.

14:38.091 --> 14:39.517
I did... the both of them.

14:39.551 --> 14:41.419
They are really bad guys.
They're really bad guys.

14:41.453 --> 14:43.454
And they're gonna come here,
and they're gonna kill me.

14:43.488 --> 14:44.889
Can you pick them out?

14:44.923 --> 14:47.725
Yeah.

14:47.759 --> 14:50.060
But I don't know what to do.
What am I supposed to do?

14:50.095 --> 14:51.829
Okay. I have no p-
What am I supposed to do?

14:51.863 --> 14:53.397
Okay, listen to me.

14:53.432 --> 14:55.332
If they were willing
to shoot a cop,

14:55.367 --> 14:57.535
they won't think twice
about killing you.

15:03.442 --> 15:06.877
Okay, thanks. I'll let them know.

15:08.613 --> 15:09.847
What can I do for you, fellas?

15:09.881 --> 15:11.715
Yeah, my vehicle got towed.
How do I get it back?

15:11.750 --> 15:13.083
You have to head over to division.

15:17.949 --> 15:19.491
Get his weapon.

15:24.564 --> 15:27.132
Set up the cellphone jammer.
Kill the power.

15:27.714 --> 15:29.909
Go to the roof. Take out the
antenna and the junction box.

15:29.910 --> 15:31.352
Keep eyes on the streets.

15:31.353 --> 15:33.019
You, cover the back
exit by the morgue.

15:33.054 --> 15:34.754
You're coming with me.
We don't have much time.

15:37.058 --> 15:40.093
Oh, my God. They're here! What? No.

15:40.127 --> 15:41.087
They're here. I told you.

15:41.088 --> 15:42.662
I told you. It's a
power failure. Calm...

15:42.697 --> 15:44.164
No, they're here. They're here. No.

15:44.198 --> 15:46.166
Everybody meet at the
loading docks in 10 minutes.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.269
Go.

15:49.303 --> 15:50.770
Jimmy, the power's out.

15:56.410 --> 15:58.611
Get his weapon.

15:58.646 --> 16:00.580
Let's go.

16:05.879 --> 16:07.579
Oh, shoot!

16:07.614 --> 16:09.248
Bass.

16:09.282 --> 16:11.984
The power's out, okay?

16:12.018 --> 16:14.620
Hey, buddy, but I still
need you to eat something.

16:14.654 --> 16:17.689
Sweetie, here we go.
Come on, sweetie.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.895
There. Quick, quick!

16:22.929 --> 16:24.763
Right there in the evidence locker.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.340
Hit it.

16:48.506 --> 16:51.750
Damn it!

16:59.315 --> 17:01.450
It's not here. Let's go.

17:21.237 --> 17:22.471
They know I'm here.
They know I'm here!

17:22.505 --> 17:23.704
I got to get out of here!

17:23.740 --> 17:25.073
I got to get out of here. No.

17:25.108 --> 17:27.342
I'm getting out of here.
I got to get out of here right now.

17:27.377 --> 17:30.279
We don't have much time.

17:32.348 --> 17:34.683
My gun.

17:34.717 --> 17:36.285
Come on, go. Go to that door.

17:36.319 --> 17:37.586
Go, go.

17:52.368 --> 17:55.470
I got to get out of here!

17:55.505 --> 17:57.206
Shh! Go up!

17:57.240 --> 17:58.707
I got to get out of here.
I got to get out of here.

17:58.741 --> 18:00.776
Shh! Go up! Go up! Up, up, up.

18:00.810 --> 18:02.010
I'm going.

18:04.247 --> 18:05.914
There, right there.
Go in the corner.

18:05.949 --> 18:07.783
Yeah. Shh.

18:07.817 --> 18:09.718
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

18:22.198 --> 18:23.295
Okay.

18:23.296 --> 18:24.933
Don't go.

18:24.968 --> 18:27.236
I got to go back down
there and help them, okay?

18:27.270 --> 18:29.905
I will be right back.
You're safer here.

19:57.953 --> 19:59.995
Are you okay?

20:01.964 --> 20:05.300
She's dead.

20:05.335 --> 20:06.768
Got here a second too late.

20:07.357 --> 20:10.105
Not for me. Thank you.
Can you walk?

20:10.678 --> 20:12.007
Yeah.

20:12.041 --> 20:13.642
But we can't get out of here.

20:13.676 --> 20:15.110
They're watching all the exits.

20:15.144 --> 20:16.311
Who are they?

20:16.346 --> 20:17.813
I don't know.

20:19.982 --> 20:21.583
I told her I could protect her.

20:26.389 --> 20:28.490
If they were here to kill a
witness, why aren't they gone?

20:28.524 --> 20:31.326
What'd she say?

20:31.361 --> 20:33.489
She said she saw Danny's shooter.

20:33.490 --> 20:34.896
Said she could I.D. him.

20:34.931 --> 20:35.964
You get a name?

20:35.998 --> 20:38.567
No, no, nothing.

20:38.601 --> 20:41.002
They ripped apart all the
desks in the squad room.

20:41.037 --> 20:42.371
What are they looking for?

20:42.405 --> 20:44.706
I don't know.

20:46.042 --> 20:49.010
The, uh... that walkie -
is it working?

20:49.045 --> 20:53.181
Only channel 12.
All homicide is out of range.

20:55.418 --> 20:57.519
What do you think?

20:57.553 --> 20:59.421
I got to find Maura and
get her out of here.

20:59.455 --> 21:00.722
Jane?

21:03.693 --> 21:04.726
Jane!

21:08.350 --> 21:10.198
Frankie?

21:23.067 --> 21:25.068
Maura.

21:25.102 --> 21:27.637
Maura.

21:27.671 --> 21:29.705
It's Jane. It's Jane.

21:29.740 --> 21:31.908
Maura!

21:31.942 --> 21:34.455
Jane. I was hiding.

21:34.759 --> 21:36.931
There are men. There are
men shooting in here.

21:36.932 --> 21:38.500
Yeah. Both of them have been shot.

21:38.534 --> 21:40.306
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Take care of him.

21:40.307 --> 21:42.787
Oh, my God. What happened?
He's been hit twice.

21:42.788 --> 21:44.056
It's all right. My vest stopped it.

21:44.057 --> 21:45.323
Okay, get him up here.

21:45.357 --> 21:46.991
The table? Already? Really?
The dead-person table?

21:47.026 --> 21:48.459
Come on.

21:50.563 --> 21:52.330
God. Okay, careful.
Careful, careful.

21:52.364 --> 21:55.533
Oh! Aah!

21:55.568 --> 21:56.935
Keep this, okay?
A-and watch the doors.

21:56.969 --> 21:59.003
I'm gonna stay with Frankie.

21:59.038 --> 22:00.305
Okay.

22:02.508 --> 22:04.142
Take his shirt off.

22:04.176 --> 22:05.577
Ah, ah.

22:05.611 --> 22:07.178
Jane, what is going on?

22:07.213 --> 22:08.980
The phones don't work.
There are men shooting here.

22:09.014 --> 22:11.182
I know, I know.

22:11.217 --> 22:13.918
And I think we're trapped in here.

22:14.800 --> 22:15.920
What about that?

22:15.921 --> 22:18.156
No, that's... that's
only for homicide cops,

22:18.190 --> 22:20.158
and... and no one's in range.

22:21.760 --> 22:24.529
Okay, lift his shirt up.

22:24.563 --> 22:25.997
Okay, okay, okay.

22:26.031 --> 22:28.499
I think I just got the wind
knocked out of me. That's all.

22:32.763 --> 22:34.018
You sure did.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.407
Hand us that binder -
the binder on the desk.

22:37.476 --> 22:39.344
We need to keep his head up.

22:39.378 --> 22:41.746
Jane, give me your jacket. Okay.

22:41.780 --> 22:44.345
Careful, okay? We're gonna
put you down. All right.

22:47.329 --> 22:48.432
Okay, got your head.

22:48.433 --> 22:51.571
Lower your head. It's okay.

22:51.572 --> 22:53.363
Got it? Okay.

22:54.143 --> 22:55.909
ABC's...

22:55.910 --> 22:58.545
airway, breathing, circulation.

22:58.579 --> 23:01.381
I should've taken an
emergency-medicine rotation.

23:01.416 --> 23:03.684
All right, take a deep breath.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.689
I-I-I can't.

23:10.224 --> 23:11.792
Ah.

23:13.961 --> 23:15.195
What are you hearing?

23:26.131 --> 23:27.407
Okay.

23:27.442 --> 23:28.542
J-Jane, you can't... Hey.

23:28.576 --> 23:30.077
It's all... it's fine, okay?

23:30.111 --> 23:31.945
It's fine.

23:31.979 --> 23:32.986
It's bad, isn't it?

23:32.987 --> 23:36.154
Massive blunt-force trauma
caused internal bleeding.

23:36.155 --> 23:38.857
It's worse than bad.

23:54.040 --> 23:56.875
Peruvian flake always looks
like mother of pearl.

23:56.909 --> 23:59.978
Why'd they leave the drugs?

24:00.012 --> 24:02.514
Killed a cop. Something
must've spooked them.

24:04.483 --> 24:06.985
Was there a drug aspect
to your two murders?

24:07.019 --> 24:08.353
No.

24:08.387 --> 24:10.424
Investigation showed
random shootings...

24:10.425 --> 24:13.591
Two truckers hauling
freight from New York.

24:13.626 --> 24:16.194
I don't want anybody in
here who doesn't belong.

24:16.228 --> 24:18.029
I want you to go over this
truck top to bottom...

24:18.064 --> 24:21.001
Obviously, there's a
lot more to this case.

24:21.002 --> 24:23.009
I want the wheels
checked, everything.

24:23.010 --> 24:25.704
Why wouldn't Cavanaugh tell you
he was putting Danny undercover?

24:25.738 --> 24:26.971
I don't know!

24:28.274 --> 24:29.549
But what do you want to

24:29.550 --> 24:31.576
bet my two dead truckers
were muling coke?

24:34.080 --> 24:36.047
What do you think Cavanaugh
had to do with it?

24:36.082 --> 24:39.417
Nothing, I hope.

24:41.721 --> 24:44.189
Let's find out.

24:45.291 --> 24:47.892
Pull up Danny's files
on the truckers.

24:51.497 --> 24:54.619
Why does everybody always use
their birth date? Here it is.

24:54.620 --> 24:57.408
Got their application for
commercial driver's licenses.

24:57.409 --> 24:59.604
When did they join the
interstate truckers union?

25:04.280 --> 25:07.545
Both got their I.T.U.
cards 18 months ago...

25:07.580 --> 25:09.748
On the same day.

25:12.318 --> 25:13.618
Check the union-card prints,

25:13.652 --> 25:15.120
see if either one of them
has a criminal record.

25:15.154 --> 25:17.055
Didn't you check
their autopsy prints?

25:17.089 --> 25:18.623
Of course I did.
They came up clean.

25:18.657 --> 25:21.226
Just run the union-card
prints, would you?

25:25.531 --> 25:27.565
They're clean, too.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.001
Okay.

25:30.035 --> 25:31.768
Compare the prints
from his union card

25:31.769 --> 25:33.781
with the prints we
took at the autopsy.

25:33.782 --> 25:36.441
Can't fake your prints
when you're dead.

25:40.875 --> 25:42.876
Look at those whorl patterns.

25:44.279 --> 25:46.947
There is no way those
are from the same guy.

25:46.982 --> 25:50.484
Did Danny keep their files
in his personal records?

25:50.518 --> 25:52.019
Right here.

25:52.053 --> 25:53.621
Okay, open those.

25:55.323 --> 25:56.991
Look at this.

25:57.025 --> 25:59.075
Our trucker has multiple arrests

25:59.076 --> 26:01.395
for possession of class-B cocaine.

26:01.429 --> 26:03.364
He used someone else's
prints to get his license.

26:03.398 --> 26:06.600
Somebody pulled their
records off the system.

26:06.635 --> 26:10.270
And somehow Danny got hold of them.

26:10.305 --> 26:11.805
Call Jane. I want to talk to Bobby.

26:18.713 --> 26:20.514
Getting voicemail.

26:20.548 --> 26:22.116
She's probably still
interviewing him.

26:22.150 --> 26:24.618
See what Danny has on
our second dead trucker.

26:31.259 --> 26:34.461
I need an MRI or CT scan, an -
an X-ray machine...

26:34.496 --> 26:37.031
something to check his
internal injuries.

26:44.072 --> 26:45.739
I was afraid of that.

26:45.774 --> 26:46.807
What?

26:46.841 --> 26:49.476
Tension pneumothorax.

26:51.012 --> 26:53.047
Maura, he's having trouble
breathing. Do something.

26:53.081 --> 26:55.349
I'm a pathologist.
I am not a surgeon.

26:55.383 --> 26:57.351
Jane, I could make it worse.

27:02.513 --> 27:04.992
What is it again? Say it again.

27:05.026 --> 27:07.728
T-tension pneumothorax. Okay.

27:07.762 --> 27:09.263
What are you doing?

27:10.732 --> 27:12.599
"Tension pneumothorax
results in death

27:12.634 --> 27:14.501
if not... if not
treated immediately."

27:14.536 --> 27:15.836
Oh, God.

27:15.870 --> 27:17.404
Jane, I'm just guessing, okay?

27:17.439 --> 27:19.039
I... I would need to confirm it.

27:19.074 --> 27:20.574
You don't have time to confirm it!

27:20.608 --> 27:22.443
Your guess is better
than most doctors'.

27:22.477 --> 27:23.510
I could be wrong.

27:25.080 --> 27:28.131
"Aggressively manage with
needle decompression to chest."

27:28.132 --> 27:30.918
I've never done it. Maura!

27:30.952 --> 27:33.520
Geez! G-get a needle. Do it.

27:35.990 --> 27:38.292
Do it now! All right.

27:38.326 --> 27:42.062
Get a... get alcohol and a
cotton ball and... and tape.

27:45.967 --> 27:47.768
I got it. I got it.

27:47.802 --> 27:49.903
All right, now,
hold on, okay? Okay.

28:14.662 --> 28:18.298
Okay, okay.

28:18.333 --> 28:19.600
Hey.

28:21.302 --> 28:22.970
Give me the tape.

28:24.606 --> 28:25.706
Okay, hold this.

28:25.740 --> 28:27.908
Hey, bud. Hey, buddy.

28:27.942 --> 28:29.777
You're okay.

28:29.811 --> 28:32.279
Shh.

28:38.486 --> 28:40.921
Hey, you're all right.
You're all right.

28:48.696 --> 28:50.297
The integrity of his chest wall

28:50.331 --> 28:51.999
has been breached by a broken rib.

28:53.301 --> 28:54.735
We got to get him to a hospital.

28:57.071 --> 28:58.906
There's at least three
men inside this building,

28:58.940 --> 29:00.307
maybe more outside.

29:00.341 --> 29:01.441
What are they carrying?

29:02.060 --> 29:04.133
I saw two MP5s.

29:07.282 --> 29:10.150
N-no. No. No, he looks better.
He... he looks better.

29:10.185 --> 29:11.652
No, not for long.

29:11.686 --> 29:13.545
I think he has a partial
tear on one of his lungs,

29:13.546 --> 29:15.425
maybe other internal organs.

29:16.237 --> 29:17.762
Which... which means what?

29:17.763 --> 29:19.827
It means that he needs surgery.

29:20.412 --> 29:21.128
How soon?

29:21.162 --> 29:22.095
Now!

29:32.733 --> 29:34.033
Hey, Ang.

29:34.068 --> 29:36.069
Remember when we took the
kids to Lake Winnipesaukee?

29:36.103 --> 29:37.704
You know, when we
took them all fishing?

29:37.738 --> 29:41.140
Yes. And we had the
rowboat that leaked.

29:41.175 --> 29:43.076
Oh, yeah!

29:43.110 --> 29:46.045
And Janie caught that
largemouth bass, you know?

29:46.080 --> 29:48.381
She was holding it up.
She was so proud.

29:48.415 --> 29:51.217
Oh, God, and Tommy had
to throw it back in

29:51.252 --> 29:53.386
because he didn't
want that fish to die.

29:54.588 --> 29:57.924
I still believe that
person is inside of him.

29:57.958 --> 30:00.894
Yeah. Me too, honey.

30:03.831 --> 30:05.498
Is that me?

30:05.532 --> 30:07.367
Yeah.

30:10.204 --> 30:12.071
Hello?

30:12.106 --> 30:13.206
Tommy!

30:13.240 --> 30:16.709
Oh, baby, it's so good
to hear your voice.

30:16.744 --> 30:19.746
What?

30:19.780 --> 30:21.614
Of course you are.

30:21.649 --> 30:23.950
We're all here waiting for you.

30:23.984 --> 30:26.819
W-what's he saying, Ang?
G-give me the phone.

30:26.854 --> 30:29.422
Tommy, please. Tommy.

30:30.147 --> 30:33.893
We are all so happy
that you're coming home.

30:33.928 --> 30:35.028
Hey, give me the phone.

30:35.062 --> 30:36.429
Tommy?

30:36.463 --> 30:37.697
Tommy, listen to me.

30:37.731 --> 30:39.699
Tommy, you come home!

30:39.733 --> 30:40.833
Gimme.

30:40.868 --> 30:42.335
Tommy?

30:42.369 --> 30:45.271
What? T-Tommy, no.

30:45.306 --> 30:46.873
No. W... listen.

30:48.609 --> 30:50.443
Don't do this to your mother.

30:50.477 --> 30:52.278
Tommy, please.

31:08.495 --> 31:11.531
Danny and Bobby both worked
Charlestown for nine years.

31:11.565 --> 31:15.101
Yeah. And both our dead
truckers lived in Charlestown.

31:15.135 --> 31:16.369
Any connection to Danny or Bobby?

31:16.403 --> 31:17.704
Nothing I can find.

31:17.738 --> 31:20.273
Cavanaugh worked Charlestown.

31:26.547 --> 31:28.014
I want to talk to Bobby.
Try Jane again.

31:35.485 --> 31:36.635
Voicemail.

31:36.636 --> 31:38.458
Try the front desk.

31:44.431 --> 31:45.865
Getting a recording.

31:48.702 --> 31:51.637
I don't like it. Come on,
let's go back to headquarters.

31:56.210 --> 31:58.211
It's okay, buddy.
We're gonna get you out of here.

31:58.245 --> 32:01.047
There's blood clotting it.

32:02.683 --> 32:04.912
Oh, turn him on his side!
What's happening?!

32:07.911 --> 32:08.839
Oh, my God.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.706
His lung is filling up with blood.

32:10.741 --> 32:11.808
Well, how do we stop it?

32:11.842 --> 32:14.243
We can't. We need a trauma center.

32:14.278 --> 32:16.145
I-I-I don't have
equipment for this.

32:16.180 --> 32:17.480
But you helped him before.

32:17.514 --> 32:19.382
The problem is his heart
right now, Jane, okay?

32:19.416 --> 32:21.150
There's too much pressure
from the bleeding.

32:21.185 --> 32:22.485
His heart can't pump.

32:22.519 --> 32:25.288
Gah! Please don't let
him die, Maura, please.

32:27.491 --> 32:29.325
We... we can't get him
out of here, okay?

32:29.359 --> 32:32.128
What can you do right
now that will help him?

32:32.162 --> 32:34.063
I don't know!

32:34.098 --> 32:36.232
I don't know what more I
can do with what I have!

32:36.266 --> 32:38.801
He is going to die right
here on this table

32:38.836 --> 32:40.470
if you don't do something... Think!

32:40.504 --> 32:42.405
Okay. Okay.

32:44.808 --> 32:47.810
You're the only one
that can save him.

32:47.845 --> 32:49.946
It's all right, buddy. All right.

33:05.329 --> 33:07.130
Rizzoli's car is still here.

33:11.335 --> 33:13.269
Where's it coming from?!

33:16.173 --> 33:18.674
On the roof!
North and south corners!

33:19.810 --> 33:21.811
Get to the radio. Why me?

33:23.046 --> 33:25.781
On me. I'm closer to
retirement. You ready?

33:27.017 --> 33:28.317
Go!

33:37.594 --> 33:38.928
We're taking fire!

33:39.730 --> 33:41.497
We got shooters on the
roof of headquarters!

33:41.532 --> 33:43.099
Get me some help down here now!

33:48.005 --> 33:50.406
This is a hospital procedure.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.841
Okay. Just do it.

33:51.875 --> 33:53.709
I don't have anesthetic.

33:53.744 --> 33:57.046
It's all right, Maura.
Just do the best you can, okay?

33:57.080 --> 33:59.248
Frankie...

33:59.283 --> 34:00.950
This is gonna hurt, okay?

34:00.984 --> 34:02.652
I have to drain the blood from
your lung so you can breathe.

34:04.087 --> 34:05.421
Maura, hurry.

34:05.455 --> 34:07.156
I need you to hold him down for me.

34:07.191 --> 34:08.824
Okay.

34:08.859 --> 34:10.393
Ugh!

34:10.427 --> 34:12.228
It's okay, bud. It's all right.

34:16.366 --> 34:19.168
Have to insert the tube
to drain the blood. Okay.

34:19.203 --> 34:20.603
We trust you.

34:20.637 --> 34:21.904
This is painful.

34:24.741 --> 34:26.042
Okay. Bud, listen to me.

34:26.076 --> 34:27.677
Hey, hey! Look at me, all right?

34:29.079 --> 34:31.047
This is gonna hurt, okay?

34:31.081 --> 34:34.350
I want you to squeeze my hand
as hard as you can, Frank.

34:34.384 --> 34:35.985
Ow.

34:37.154 --> 34:38.087
Aah!

34:51.904 --> 34:54.472
Get down! Shooter on the roof!

34:55.572 --> 34:58.074
What do we got?
A mess is what we got!

35:00.978 --> 35:03.079
You tell me right now what
you had to do with this!

35:04.681 --> 35:06.916
If you're any part of it,
I'll kill you myself!

35:06.950 --> 35:08.517
Who the hell you think
you're talking to?!

35:09.286 --> 35:11.120
I sent Danny in there by himself!

35:11.154 --> 35:13.122
His murder's on me!

35:17.728 --> 35:19.528
Okay.

35:20.039 --> 35:21.622
We got to get people out.

35:21.798 --> 35:24.867
We think Rizzoli and
Marino are in there.

35:24.901 --> 35:27.036
Dr. Isles and Frankie are
probably in there, too.

35:27.070 --> 35:29.905
One shooter at the rear
entry to the morgue.

35:29.940 --> 35:32.375
Snipers are moving into position.
How many inside?

35:32.409 --> 35:34.577
We've got a visual
on one, in the lobby.

35:34.611 --> 35:36.245
Got to figure out
how to communicate.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.893
We're gonna go old school.
Use channel 12.

35:37.894 --> 35:39.782
Frost, give me a walkie.

35:43.020 --> 35:44.320
Jane never carries hers!

35:44.354 --> 35:45.554
Maybe we'll get lucky.

35:45.589 --> 35:46.922
Jane, you hear me?

35:46.957 --> 35:48.291
Jane, can you hear me?

35:49.459 --> 35:51.494
Do you copy?

35:53.964 --> 35:55.498
Korsak, is that you?

35:55.532 --> 35:56.632
Jane. Where are you?

35:56.667 --> 35:58.134
W-we're in the autopsy room.

35:58.168 --> 35:59.268
Are you okay?

35:59.303 --> 36:01.604
We got a-at least two
dead, two wounded.

36:01.638 --> 36:03.455
Marino's got a gunshot
wound to the thigh.

36:03.456 --> 36:06.075
Frankie took two to the chest.
He's... he's hurt real bad.

36:06.109 --> 36:08.344
Can you hold them off, Jane?

36:08.378 --> 36:10.146
Not for long.

36:10.180 --> 36:11.681
Th-they're looking for something.

36:11.715 --> 36:13.916
Oh, wait, wait.

36:13.950 --> 36:14.807
They... they... they were

36:14.808 --> 36:16.385
looking for something
in the evidence lockers.

36:17.321 --> 36:18.988
B-but they didn't
find whatever it s.

36:19.022 --> 36:20.256
What, you're telling me this now?

36:20.290 --> 36:22.658
I'm sorry. I kind of
had my hands full.

36:22.693 --> 36:25.594
Jane, did you log in any
evidence from the crime scene?

36:25.629 --> 36:28.204
Uh, uh, only the -
the pack of cigarettes,

36:28.205 --> 36:30.184
but I haven't logged them in yet.

36:30.185 --> 36:32.234
Why? What... what do they
want with Danny's cigarettes?

36:32.269 --> 36:36.105
Danny doesn't smoke.
His old man died of lung cancer.

36:37.874 --> 36:39.675
So there's something
in the cigarette pack.

36:39.710 --> 36:41.510
Yeah, like what? Where is it?

36:41.545 --> 36:43.145
Uh... Oh, it's right here.

36:46.550 --> 36:47.683
Drop it.

36:57.304 --> 36:59.238
You...

36:59.844 --> 37:00.820
Drop the radio.

37:00.821 --> 37:02.954
Jane? Jane, what's happening?!

37:06.325 --> 37:08.259
Give me the cigarettes.

37:09.328 --> 37:11.930
You got till I count to
three, or this cop is dead.

37:11.964 --> 37:13.765
One...

37:13.799 --> 37:14.799
Two... Aah!

37:14.834 --> 37:17.235
All right, all right!
They're right there.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.872
Don't you screw with me.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.508
Just stop, all right?

37:23.542 --> 37:25.310
They're in my jacket,
under his head.

37:26.645 --> 37:27.846
Get them.

37:30.149 --> 37:32.250
It's all right.

37:32.284 --> 37:33.952
Here.

37:33.986 --> 37:36.688
Give them to Bobby.

37:56.175 --> 37:58.376
Smile.

38:00.502 --> 38:02.102
You're on Danny's camera.

38:10.173 --> 38:13.084
Danny didn't know that you
were running the drug ring,

38:13.085 --> 38:15.595
but he must've suspected something.

38:15.596 --> 38:18.663
That's why he was wearing a wire
and carrying a hidden camera.

38:18.697 --> 38:20.865
He just couldn't stop digging.

38:20.900 --> 38:22.467
That was Danny.

38:25.104 --> 38:26.871
I wasn't planning on killing him,

38:26.906 --> 38:30.942
but he showed up at the warehouse.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.777
He didn't leave me any choice.

38:33.604 --> 38:36.014
You killed the other
witness, too, didn't you?

38:36.048 --> 38:38.750
What's one less crack whore, right?

38:38.784 --> 38:41.352
You son of a bitch.

38:41.387 --> 38:44.556
Nah. I'm not a son of a bitch.

38:53.132 --> 38:55.500
I'm a freakin' hero.

38:57.814 --> 39:00.038
Now that I got what I need...

39:01.073 --> 39:02.740
...I'm just gonna sit tight...

39:02.775 --> 39:04.008
And wait to be rescued.

39:11.550 --> 39:15.253
That is, after I shoot
the three of you.

39:16.689 --> 39:18.456
I wouldn't do that, Bobby.

39:20.826 --> 39:23.428
Bobby, it's over.

39:31.670 --> 39:35.139
Sniper 1, you've got a
green light on that shot.

39:36.108 --> 39:38.276
Take it.

39:40.646 --> 39:42.280
Get your team into the morgue now!

39:42.314 --> 39:44.916
Team 1, move, move, move!
Team 3, move, move!

39:56.695 --> 39:58.162
Ugh!

40:02.201 --> 40:04.168
Come on.

40:04.203 --> 40:06.037
Come on, come on. No, no, no, no!

40:06.071 --> 40:08.539
It's fine.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.244
Aah!

40:20.552 --> 40:21.786
Tell them to hold their fire!

40:21.820 --> 40:23.254
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

40:24.723 --> 40:27.125
I've got a visual -
one shooter, one hostage.

40:28.394 --> 40:30.785
Bobby, let her go! It's over!

40:31.063 --> 40:32.530
Can you make the shot?

40:33.932 --> 40:35.466
He's got her too tight.

40:35.501 --> 40:38.002
Bobby, please, this
is over! Please!

40:38.037 --> 40:40.706
Drop the gun, Bobby!
Don't make it worse on yourself!

40:40.707 --> 40:41.915
Let her go!

40:41.916 --> 40:43.715
Please! Frankie is bleeding!

40:43.716 --> 40:45.014
Shut up and do it!
Take out your keys!

40:45.015 --> 40:46.177
Shoot him!

40:46.710 --> 40:48.140
Just shoot him!

40:48.141 --> 40:49.653
Put your guns down, or she's dead!

40:49.654 --> 40:52.050
No, don't! Frankie's bleeding!
There's no time!

40:52.084 --> 40:54.014
Your brother's
probably already dead.

40:54.015 --> 40:56.487
No-o-o!

41:09.368 --> 41:10.702
Jane!
