Good meeting.

00:07.020 --> 00:09.238
Oh, Jeff, what time's dinner?

00:09.273 --> 00:11.040
Uh, dinner?

00:11.091 --> 00:13.042
Jeff, you didn't invite Shirley?

00:13.076 --> 00:14.477
Well, it's Tuesday.

Shirley always goes to Elijah's
karate practice on Tuesdays.

00:17.347 --> 00:19.565
It's okay. Part of making sacrifices

00:19.600 --> 00:21.567

Aw.

00:31.445 --> 00:34.664
When Shirley can have dinner,
we'll have another dinner,

00:34.698 --> 00:36.732
because it's just dinner.

00:36.767 --> 00:38.834
And there's no need
to manipulate each other.

This is David and Bixel.

00:54.368 --> 00:56.102
They're app designers.

00:56.136 --> 00:57.403
They'd like to beta test

00:57.437 --> 01:00.373
their latest social-networking
app on our campus,

01:00.407 --> 01:01.607
which could be good for us.

01:01.625 --> 01:03.442
Look what Facebook did
for Harvard, right?

01:03.460 --> 01:05.578
Hey, guys.
Bixel and I would like

01:05.596 --> 01:09.165
to introduce you to a little app
called MeowMeowBeenz.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.384
- Ooh.
- MeowMeowBeenz let's you say

01:11.418 --> 01:14.720
how much you like,
who you like, when you like,

01:14.738 --> 01:17.506
all from a standard
non-boost mobile phone.

01:17.541 --> 01:19.258
Let's see how it works.

01:19.293 --> 01:22.612
Bixel, what did you think of
the way the Dean introduced us?

01:22.646 --> 01:23.980
I thought he did great.

01:24.014 --> 01:26.682
That's why I'm giving him
five MeowMeowBeenz.

but I thought his intro
was just okay.

01:32.956 --> 01:34.924
That's why I'm gonna give him

01:34.958 --> 01:38.561
two out of five MeowMeowBeenz.

- It's addictively effective.
- No, it's effectively stupid.

in place called "cool people get more,"

MeowMeowBeenz takes everything
subjective and unspoken

Uh, I liked the idea at first,
giving a voice to the unheard,

but then Annie just told me

04:07.344 --> 04:09.979
that the rating system
is exponentially weighted.

As your ratings go up,
your ratings of other people

- become more important.
- No.

09:19.423 --> 09:21.975
That's nice.

09:27.210 --> 09:29.306

09:32.203 --> 09:33.469
You there, girl.

09:33.504 --> 09:35.054
How many MeowMeowBeenz?

09:35.089 --> 09:37.056
- [Stammers]
- Two!

09:37.107 --> 09:38.474
[Laughter]

09:38.492 --> 09:40.460
Two? Are you lost, Two?

09:40.494 --> 09:43.363
Yes. Are you lost, Two?

09:43.397 --> 09:45.782
I'll escort her to the common area.

09:45.816 --> 09:48.218
You're a Four?
I don't recognize you.

09:48.252 --> 09:49.485
He's new Beenz.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.621
[Laughter]
Bye-bye, new Beenz.

09:51.655 --> 09:55.541
<i>Threes and Twos must leave
building one after 7:00.</i>

09:55.593 --> 09:58.611
<i>Building one after 7:00 is Fours only.</i>

09:58.616 --> 10:00.696
- What are you doing here?
- How goes the revolution?

10:00.714 --> 10:02.131
I can't break a Four.

10:02.165 --> 10:05.001
It's impossible to get any higher
without half the Fives in your corner.

10:05.035 --> 10:06.235
They got this thing locked up.

10:06.237 --> 10:07.370
Yeah, but they're nervous.

10:07.404 --> 10:10.206
They're hosting a talent show
to prove that anyone can be a Five.

10:10.224 --> 10:13.176
If you enter it, you'll be center stage
with all eyes on you,

10:13.210 --> 10:16.296
and you can tell everyone
this isn't democracy.

10:16.330 --> 10:18.264
This is tyranny.

10:18.299 --> 10:19.849
I'm sorry.
Can you put some mustard...

10:19.883 --> 10:22.485
I shouldn't have to put
mustard on my face

10:22.519 --> 10:23.836
for this to make sense.

10:23.871 --> 10:25.471
You know we have to take
this system down.

10:25.506 --> 10:27.473
[Gasps]

10:32.913 --> 10:34.314
You know...

10:34.348 --> 10:37.383
I once loved a Two.

10:37.418 --> 10:40.253
[Sighs]
Matthew...

10:40.304 --> 10:43.072
He was my everything.

10:43.107 --> 10:46.342
But numbers change.

10:49.813 --> 10:53.283
I'll keep your secret, new Beenz.

[Electronic music plays]

11:00.824 --> 11:02.041
It says you're next.

11:02.076 --> 11:04.260
Now, Jeffrey, I beg you
not to take this risk.

11:04.294 --> 11:05.478
You know what they say.

11:05.529 --> 11:07.313
Fives have lives,
Fours have chores,

11:07.364 --> 11:09.215
Threes have fleas,
Twos have blues,

11:09.249 --> 11:11.801
and Ones don't get a rhyme
because they're garbage.

11:11.835 --> 11:13.669
Craig, I got this.

Please!

Boo on you!

11:29.436 --> 11:32.405
The Fives have spoken!

11:32.439 --> 11:35.775

11:35.809 --> 11:38.378

[Feedback whines]

12:01.869 --> 12:03.353
My name is Jeff Winger.

12:03.387 --> 12:05.805
I recently became a Four.

12:05.856 --> 12:10.009
Funny thing is, when I was a Two,

12:10.044 --> 12:13.858
I didn't actually have any less.

12:14.748 --> 12:18.300
But I did have a lot of crazy friends.

12:18.318 --> 12:20.703
[Brooklyn accent]
Hey, my name's Tommy Talouca.

12:20.737 --> 12:22.088
I'm from hallway "C."

12:22.122 --> 12:23.523
I'm a Two!

12:23.557 --> 12:27.727
I got to get to the cafeteria
before they run out of apples!

12:27.761 --> 12:29.328
[Laughter]

12:29.380 --> 12:31.597
What is with Twos and apples?

12:31.632 --> 12:33.349
You're given three kinds of fruit.

12:33.384 --> 12:36.218
Mix it up.
[Laughter]

12:36.236 --> 12:38.538
Then you become a Four.

12:38.589 --> 12:41.391
And you get that, uh...
that Four walk.

12:41.425 --> 12:43.309
You know what I'm talking about?
It's like this.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.895
It's like one of these.
[Laughter]

12:45.913 --> 12:48.347
And they got a little trail
of Twos behind them,

12:48.382 --> 12:51.084
and they're like "Hey,
is there an apple up there?"

12:51.118 --> 12:53.119
[Riotous laughter]

12:53.153 --> 12:55.438
Oh, [bleep].

Wow. What else is going on?

- Shh!

13:00.060 --> 13:02.095
[Old man voice]
There came a time

13:02.146 --> 13:04.797
when I has to a "aks" myself,

13:04.832 --> 13:08.217
did I even want to be a Three?

13:08.252 --> 13:12.755
Or did I just hate myself
for being a Two?

13:12.790 --> 13:15.191
I don't know.

13:15.225 --> 13:17.693
All I know is...

13:17.728 --> 13:20.663
I sure do love them apples!

I want my future kids
to know this happened.

14:04.958 --> 14:07.960
I admire your optimism, Garrett.

14:09.246 --> 14:11.097
- What the hell?
- I don't want to hear it.

14:11.131 --> 14:13.131
I got this far because I need
to take Shirley down.

14:13.133 --> 14:15.101
- What about everyone else?
- Look around you, Britta.

14:15.135 --> 14:17.854
Everyone wanted this.

gonna last forever?

[Futuristic music plays]

14:51.407 --> 14:53.475
I'm glad you don't think
making Jeff a Five was a mistake

14:53.509 --> 14:54.576
like everybody else.

14:54.610 --> 14:56.110
I believe in taking risks.

14:56.144 --> 14:59.214
Yeah! Jeff's really cool.

14:59.248 --> 15:00.782
Couldn't help but notice

15:00.816 --> 15:02.484
that Shirley didn't clap
with the rest of you

15:02.518 --> 15:04.085
after my performance.

15:04.119 --> 15:05.987
Is she always so different?

15:06.021 --> 15:07.889
If you talk to me, I can't
concentrate on the dance moves.

15:07.923 --> 15:09.724
You don't believe the rumors,
do you, Koogler,

15:09.725 --> 15:12.026
that Jeff manipulated
his way to the top?

15:12.060 --> 15:14.669
Shirley, I can hear what you're saying.

15:14.704 --> 15:17.465
You're trying to manipulate someone
into thinking I'm manipulative.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.234
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:19.402 --> 15:21.169
No one ever knows
what you're talking about

15:21.204 --> 15:22.804
because you never say what you mean.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.318
Do you want to have this conversation,

15:24.340 --> 15:25.807
or do you want to just keep
flexing your veiny arms

and be in charge now.

19:55.244 --> 19:58.346
So I was thinking about checking out
this new restaurant tonight.

19:58.381 --> 20:00.215
Oh, that's sweet, but I can't tonight.

20:00.249 --> 20:02.584
Not even takeout?

20:02.618 --> 20:04.452
We could eat in the study room.

20:04.487 --> 20:06.654
Oh, I think I have time for that.

20:06.689 --> 20:09.491
Jeffrey.

20:09.525 --> 20:10.992
[Laughter]
What?

20:11.026 --> 20:13.127
I'm not gonna take it off.

20:13.161 --> 20:15.630
I still got two days left
on the rental.

20:15.664 --> 20:16.931
[Chuckles]

20:18.909 --> 20:21.043
<i>Every once in a while,
a film comes along</i>

20:21.077 --> 20:24.490
<i>that takes a serious look
at higher education.</i>

20:24.525 --> 20:25.781
<i>This is not one of them.</i>

20:25.815 --> 20:27.516
Gentlemen...

20:27.551 --> 20:29.819
Assume the party.

20:29.953 --> 20:31.554
<i>This summer...</i>

20:31.588 --> 20:33.121
<i>fun has a new name.</i>

20:33.157 --> 20:34.257
- Koogler?
- Koogler!

20:34.291 --> 20:35.558
- Koogler.
- Koogler!

20:35.592 --> 20:36.594
Koogler!

20:36.599 --> 20:38.670
ALL:
Koogler! Koogler!

20:39.496 --> 20:40.996
Hope you don't mind
if I play through.

20:41.030 --> 20:43.699
<i>Hammer Road Pictures invited
you to meet the man...</i>

20:43.733 --> 20:45.201
<i>the myth...</i>

20:45.235 --> 20:46.669
I'm photocopying my rear end.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.271
<i>...the Koogler.</i>

20:48.305 --> 20:49.305
Koogler.

20:49.306 --> 20:51.174
I guess I have what you might call

20:51.208 --> 20:54.710
an aversion to education.
[Slurping]

20:54.744 --> 20:56.446
Do you even have a career plan?

20:56.480 --> 20:58.648
Yeah, uh, does getting laid count?

20:58.782 --> 20:59.882
No!

20:59.916 --> 21:02.665
<i>Mitchell D. Hurwitz is Koogler...</i>

21:02.666 --> 21:03.666
<i>Rated "R."</i>
