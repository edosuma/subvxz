Max, you there?

- [Match Striking]
- [Gasps]

00:58.725 --> 01:01.091
You're late, kid.

01:04.263 --> 01:07.597
- You get lost?
- Sorry. I had to wait
till my mom took off.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.363
It's way past
his bedtime, Max.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.172
He's not cut out for this.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.669
Cut out for what?

01:17.744 --> 01:19.837
Oh, there's more here
than just trees.

01:21.781 --> 01:23.715
Before you can find out what,

01:23.783 --> 01:26.616
I gotta know that you're not gonna
tell anyone about this place.

01:26.686 --> 01:28.711
I won't. I swear.

01:30.190 --> 01:33.648
It's a vow, Tony. Don't make it
if you're gonna break it.

01:33.726 --> 01:36.388
I won't break it, man.
Not ever.

01:37.697 --> 01:39.631
No matter what?

01:40.633 --> 01:42.828
Even if someone
dies tonight?

[Siren Wails]

02:03.890 --> 02:07.189
Anthony Reed.

02:08.561 --> 02:12.156
- Got any outstanding warrants?
- No, of course not.

02:12.232 --> 02:15.724
Well, I'm gonna have to
check it out for myself.
So, put your hands on the vehicle.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.430
- Look, I was just taking a walk.
- Uh-huh.

02:18.505 --> 02:21.565
Right past all those big
"no trespassing" signs?

02:21.641 --> 02:23.575
Now you just stand there
for a minute.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.612
Come on, man.
I didn't do anything.

02:26.679 --> 02:30.046
I wish I had a nickel for every time I
had to drag you kids out of these woods.

02:30.116 --> 02:34.246
It'd be a lot of nickels.
Do you have any calls from dispatch?

[Policeman Screams]

02:40.026 --> 02:42.426
Sir?

02:44.230 --> 02:47.722
[Woman Over Radio]
Dispatch to Foster.
I didn't copy your last transmission.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.563
Officer?

02:54.674 --> 02:57.472
Dispatch to Foster,
do you copy?

03:04.884 --> 03:08.581
Deputy Foster, this is Dispatch.
Do you copy?

03:12.992 --> 03:15.790
Deputy Foster, sir,
what's your 20?

[Elevator Bell Dings]

04:22.060 --> 04:25.029
Oh. There you are.
Heavy traffic?

04:25.097 --> 04:30.262
Slow going. Let's just say
I had ample time to read
the police report you faxed me.

04:30.335 --> 04:34.465
Thoughtfully provided by the
local authorities, even though
it doesn't tell the whole story.

04:34.539 --> 04:38.373
A sheriff's deputy is slain
during a routine patrol.

04:38.443 --> 04:41.537
It's a tragic occurrence, but
I don't see the mystery here, Mulder.

04:41.613 --> 04:44.946
Except said that the deputy was beaten
to death by an invisible assailant.

04:45.017 --> 04:47.952
Yes, but that's according to the
young man who's accused of his murder.

04:48.020 --> 04:51.353
One Tony Reed, and I'm guessing
wrongfully accused.

04:51.423 --> 04:53.948
He's an "A" student, moved here
a few months ago from Philadelphia.

04:54.026 --> 04:56.085
He's never been in trouble
in his life.

04:56.161 --> 05:01.189
Tell me you've got more than
S.A.T. Scores to show that Tony
Reed didn't commit this crime.

05:01.266 --> 05:03.894
Maybe. Take a look
at the body.

05:15.847 --> 05:18.475
The former Deputy Ronald Foster.

05:18.550 --> 05:23.613
As you can see, the report doesn't
quite do it justice.

05:23.689 --> 05:26.783
Oh, my God. It looks like
he was hit with a sledgehammer.

05:26.858 --> 05:29.292
Police flashlight.

05:29.361 --> 05:31.989
One blow.

05:36.968 --> 05:39.903
Damage to the maxilla facial
bones and the cranium...

05:39.971 --> 05:45.068
is consistent with
a blunt force trauma, but...

05:45.143 --> 05:48.510
I'd say that Tony
eats his Wheaties.

05:48.580 --> 05:51.515
Check out the back
of his head.

05:59.057 --> 06:00.991
[Gasps]

06:02.027 --> 06:04.154
His eyeglasses.

06:04.229 --> 06:06.493
Penetrated to the back
of his skull.

06:06.565 --> 06:09.864
Babe Ruth couldn't hit this hard,
let alone a high school sophomore.

06:09.935 --> 06:13.564
Well, maybe if he was under
the influence of P.C.P.
Or some kind of stimulant.

06:13.638 --> 06:16.630
- No, his tox screen came back negative.
- Well, even so,

06:16.708 --> 06:20.838
I mean, stress and fear
may have triggered an adrenalin
response which is known to...

06:20.912 --> 06:22.880
enable feats of
near super human strength.

06:22.948 --> 06:26.543
Agent Mulder? How long you plannin'
on bein'down here?

06:26.618 --> 06:29.416
Sheriff Harden, this is
my partner, Agent Scully.

06:29.488 --> 06:31.683
How long you plan
on bein' down here?

06:31.757 --> 06:35.557
I'd like Ron left in peace. I don't
know what there is to see anyway.

06:35.627 --> 06:39.119
- We got the kid who did it.
- Sheriff, we don't mean
to second-guess you.

06:39.197 --> 06:42.724
- We're just hoping to be
of some assistance.
- Well, I don't need it.

06:42.801 --> 06:45.361
I got the murder weapon
with bloody fingerprints,

06:45.437 --> 06:49.965
and once the state crime lab
matches that up with Tony Reed,
it's open and shut.

06:51.543 --> 06:54.103
- Well, uh, we're done here, right?
- Mm-hmm.

06:54.179 --> 06:57.376
But, Sheriff Harden, you won't mind
if I talk to Tony Reed, do you?

06:57.449 --> 07:01.545
I mean, it won't hurt your case. And
if he did do it, you'll wanna know why.

07:14.533 --> 07:17.331
What?

07:17.402 --> 07:21.236
Well, Tony, this must be
your lucky day for visitors.

07:21.306 --> 07:25.072
- This is Agent Scully with the F.B. I...
- I'm not talkin' anymore, okay?

07:25.143 --> 07:27.941
Well, that might
make things worse.

07:28.013 --> 07:30.072
They seem pretty bad
already.

07:30.148 --> 07:34.778
In your statement, you say that
Deputy Foster stopped you.

07:34.853 --> 07:37.447
But you don't say why.

07:38.990 --> 07:42.323
Come on.
You were cruisin', right?

07:42.394 --> 07:46.023
I mean, a small town like this, you're
not exactly livin' la vida loca.

07:46.097 --> 07:51.091
I know. I grew up in Dullsville too.
Nothing to do but drive and park.

07:51.169 --> 07:55.162
How long ago was that?
Look.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.800
Don't you think
I know what you're doing?

07:57.876 --> 08:01.835
You're like the tenth cop
who's come in here trying to
relate to me till I confess.

08:01.913 --> 08:06.577
If you didn't do it, it's all
the more reason to clear it up.

08:06.651 --> 08:11.020
Everything I know...
is in my statement.

08:11.089 --> 08:13.956
Okay, but bear with us,
'cause we're old and stupid.

08:14.025 --> 08:17.688
How long was it between
the time you heard the scream...

08:17.762 --> 08:20.492
to the time that you found
Deputy Foster?

08:24.936 --> 08:28.030
Tony, you're not likely
to get a fairer hearing than this.

08:32.244 --> 08:35.509
Maybe ten, fifteen seconds.

08:37.315 --> 08:41.011
You didn't see anyone near the
patrol car? You didn't hear anything?

08:41.086 --> 08:44.179
And you're still
gonna stick with your story...

08:44.256 --> 08:46.918
that you were the only one there,
is that right?

08:48.660 --> 08:51.094
Uh...

08:57.168 --> 08:59.261
I wanna go back
to my cell.

09:09.781 --> 09:13.740
Sixteen years old and his life is over
unless he starts tellin' the truth.

09:13.818 --> 09:17.185
If you really think he's guilty,
why don't you ask yourself this:

09:17.255 --> 09:19.587
Why wouldn't he make up
a more plausible cover story?

09:19.658 --> 09:22.718
Why didn't he say that a pickup
full of hillbillies...

09:22.794 --> 09:26.161
drove by and clobbered
the deputy and ran away?

09:26.231 --> 09:28.631
I'm not saying he's guilty.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.260
I'm inclined to agree that Tony Reed
did not commit murder.

09:31.336 --> 09:35.432
But I think that he saw the person who
did, and he may be covering up for it.

09:35.507 --> 09:38.908
I'm not sure there was a person to see.
I think there was a force at work here.

09:38.977 --> 09:44.074
- What kind of force?
- Some kind of territorial
or spiritual entity maybe.

09:44.149 --> 09:47.243
Poltergeists have long been associated
with violent acts like this,

09:47.319 --> 09:49.480
and they tend to manifest
around young people.

09:49.554 --> 09:52.250
They seem to be drawn
to the turmoil of adolescence.

09:52.324 --> 09:55.782
Mulder, rather than spirits,

09:55.860 --> 10:00.194
can we at least start
with Tony's friends?

10:00.265 --> 10:02.426
Please, just... for me?

10:02.500 --> 10:05.799
I think there's one person in particular
I'd like to talk to.

10:07.939 --> 10:10.464
[Man]
Let's wrap it up, people.

10:10.542 --> 10:12.942
Two-minute warnin'.

10:31.496 --> 10:33.589
There goes half
your grade, Max.

10:33.665 --> 10:36.600
- You missed the midterm.
- Not if I take it right now.

10:39.137 --> 10:41.628
- In one minute?
- Oh, I've been studying.

10:46.845 --> 10:48.813
I don't care
who your father is.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.940
You fail my test, it sticks.

10:52.017 --> 10:54.383
I guess I better
ace it then, huh?

11:05.764 --> 11:07.789
Take your seat,
young man.

11:12.037 --> 11:16.406
- Piece of cake.
- It is when you mark 'em at random.

11:16.474 --> 11:18.908
Go ahead. Check it.

11:30.989 --> 11:33.856

than people know.

This is Agent Mulder.
We're with the F.B.I.

11:49.673 --> 11:54.269
- I remember you.
- Chastity, what did you and
Tony talk about this morning?

11:54.344 --> 11:58.576
- He didn't kill that cop.
- How can you be so sure?

11:58.649 --> 12:02.551
- Tony just doesn't have it in him.
- Do you?

12:04.788 --> 12:06.779
Were you there
when it happened?

12:08.125 --> 12:10.116
Look, I gotta go.

12:10.193 --> 12:14.892
Do you realize that Tony
could go to prison for the
rest of his life for this?

12:14.965 --> 12:17.798
Chastity, if you know something,
now's the time to mention it.

12:19.970 --> 12:24.430
- Unless they got a warrant,
you don't have to say nothin'.
- Wow. You must be her lawyer.

12:24.508 --> 12:26.806
Let's go.

12:26.877 --> 12:30.369
Butting into our investigation.
I wonder what your father,
the sheriff, would think.

12:30.447 --> 12:34.474
- How do you know who my dad is?
- You got the same last name.

12:34.551 --> 12:36.712
Oh, you're good.

12:36.787 --> 12:39.119
We're done here.
Come on, babe.

12:39.189 --> 12:41.282

a Betty back in the day.

- "Back in the day."

12:54.338 --> 12:56.738
What about the
murder weapon?

12:56.807 --> 13:01.176
All I know is we put the flashlight
in here and now it's gone.

13:01.244 --> 13:05.078
It's like it just disappeared
into thin air.

13:05.148 --> 13:09.414
- How many people have access
to this evidence room?
- Only me and the dozen deputies.

13:09.486 --> 13:12.478
What does the tape show?

13:12.556 --> 13:16.390
That no unauthorized persons came in and
no one went anywhere near this locker.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.951
- Was this here before?
- I don't know.

13:20.897 --> 13:23.491
Can we take a look
at the surveillance tape?

13:23.567 --> 13:27.765
[Sheriff] You can see that
the flashlight was properly secured.

13:27.838 --> 13:31.501
It's not like we're runnin'some kind
of half-assed operation here.

13:31.575 --> 13:33.543
No one's saying
that you are, Sheriff.

13:35.746 --> 13:38.806
Here's when the state police
showed up to take it to the crime lab.

13:38.882 --> 13:40.816
There's me goin'to get it.

13:40.884 --> 13:44.513
We opened up the locker,
and it's gone.

13:46.790 --> 13:52.319
I maybe, uh, didn't give you
all the warmest welcome,
but if you have any ideas.

13:52.396 --> 13:55.627
- May I?
- I watched it a dozen times.

13:55.699 --> 13:59.829
- Could there be a malfunction
with the V.C.R.?
- I don't see how.

13:59.903 --> 14:01.996
Plus, there's no gap
in the time code.

14:02.072 --> 14:06.202
The murder weapon was
the only hard evidence we had.

14:06.276 --> 14:08.471
Without it, we got no case.

14:08.545 --> 14:11.378
You know what I gotta do now?

14:11.448 --> 14:16.044
I gotta call Ron Foster's widow and tell
her that I gotta turn his killer loose.

14:25.195 --> 14:27.663

14:29.566 --> 14:33.764
- What am I supposed to be seeing?
- Here it comes.

Now you see it.

14:35.839 --> 14:38.273
One more frame.
Now you don't.

14:38.341 --> 14:41.071
What do you make of that, Scully?

Now it's here.

14:43.180 --> 14:45.614

Are you ready to be
straight with me?

15:03.433 --> 15:05.901
Leave me alone, Mom.
Would you just leave me alone.

15:05.969 --> 15:07.903
I'm tired!

This isn't like a bad report card,
Anthony. A man is dead.

15:14.144 --> 15:17.136
I told you,
I didn't do it!

15:17.214 --> 15:20.809
It's just that what you say happened
doesn't make sense.

15:20.884 --> 15:23.375
There's gotta be
more to it.

15:23.453 --> 15:25.887
Well, there isn't.
Okay?

15:27.324 --> 15:30.816
Are those kids involved in this?
That boy Max?

No.

only friends I have here.

- Whose car is this, Max?

What do you mean, "He had to go"?
What happened out there?

You gotta learn not
to ask so many questions.

17:29.579 --> 17:32.070
Slow the hell down, man!
You're freakin' me out!

17:32.148 --> 17:35.174
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

17:35.252 --> 17:38.551
- [Tires Screeching]
- Max, look out!

17:38.622 --> 17:40.214
[Gasps]

18:09.886 --> 18:11.979
[Gasps]

18:12.055 --> 18:14.546
I'm gonna make you
one of us.

18:15.792 --> 18:19.228
But I call the shots.
Always remember that.

18:37.781 --> 18:40.045
Hey, Chuck.

18:40.116 --> 18:42.983
Sorry to make you trek over here
for what's probably a glitch.

18:43.053 --> 18:45.749
- What'd you come up with?
- Nothing but eye strain at first.

18:45.822 --> 18:48.586
Then I ran it through
my imaging software.

18:48.658 --> 18:52.890
I'm here to tell you, it's not a glitch.
It's what the camera saw.

18:52.962 --> 18:57.160
Buckle up, Scully.
I believe Chuck is about to take us on
a ride through the paranormal.

18:57.233 --> 19:01.499
Yes and no. Initially,
I was thinking spectral manifestation.

19:01.571 --> 19:06.508
But with spirit activity, you'd expect
to see light streaks, auras,

19:06.576 --> 19:10.205
atmospheric disturbances,
translucent fgures.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.044
Whatever this is,
it's not a ghost.

19:13.116 --> 19:17.678
Especially since ghost don't
go around leaving synthetic
polymers in their wake.

19:17.754 --> 19:19.847
That's what the gunk
on the floor turned out to be.

19:19.923 --> 19:23.518
Huh. I dig a mystery
with layers.

19:23.593 --> 19:26.357
Chuck, I get the feeling
you don't know what the hell this is.

19:26.429 --> 19:29.830
I cross-referenced
the shape's silhouette...

19:29.899 --> 19:34.768
against every organic
and inorganic object
in the Library of Congress database.

19:34.838 --> 19:38.569
The closest match was
a Soviet Akula class submarine.

19:39.642 --> 19:41.576
I think we can
rule that out.

19:41.644 --> 19:45.882
And then there's
this weirdness.

19:46.015 --> 19:49.576
- My enhancement
brought up this dark edge...
- [Mulder] Mm-hmm.

19:49.652 --> 19:51.620
Around the anomaly.

19:51.687 --> 19:54.884
- A shadow.
- It fit with the lighting in the room.

19:54.957 --> 20:00.122
- The problem is it can't be
throwing a shadow unless...
- Unless it's a solid object.

20:00.196 --> 20:02.892
Which is impossible because
it only appears for a single frame.

20:02.965 --> 20:06.128
One-thirtieth of a second.

20:06.202 --> 20:10.298
You know what? Maybe, uh,
SCAG can give us a clearer picture.

20:10.373 --> 20:14.503
- SCAG?
- Spectrographic Color
Attribute Generator.

20:14.577 --> 20:17.910
I'm beta testing it
forJ.P.L.

20:17.980 --> 20:21.677
It's still in the tweaking phase,
but the basic idea is...

20:21.751 --> 20:24.083
I assign known color values...

20:24.153 --> 20:26.087
onto the black-and-white image.

20:27.523 --> 20:31.357
Then SCAG assigns chromatic values
throughout the frame,

20:31.427 --> 20:34.658
in effect making an
educated guess at, uh,

20:34.730 --> 20:37.324
what all the colors
might be.

20:40.803 --> 20:43.601
It still needs fine tuning.

20:44.674 --> 20:46.699
What?

20:46.776 --> 20:49.267
You recognize these colors, Scully?

21:09.365 --> 21:12.630
- Hey, Tony.
- Everyone's looking at me
like I'm a criminal.

21:13.869 --> 21:17.032
I'm not.
I heard you took a ride.

21:17.106 --> 21:20.542
What was that?
How did he do it?

21:20.609 --> 21:23.237
You'll find out.

21:23.312 --> 21:26.577
Maybe you were right...
about me not bein' cut out for this.

21:26.649 --> 21:29.675
It's a little late
for second thoughts.

21:32.154 --> 21:34.588
You tryin' to move in
on my girl?

21:37.126 --> 21:40.186
- [Bell Ringing]
- Saved by the bell.

21:55.478 --> 21:58.914
Hey, you wanna stare at someone?
Stare at me.

22:01.517 --> 22:03.382
Well, class.

22:03.452 --> 22:06.421
I graded your midterms.

22:06.489 --> 22:10.585
Save for a few of you,
the news is not good.

22:10.659 --> 22:13.184
Mr. Pembleton.

22:13.262 --> 22:15.560
What happened?

22:15.631 --> 22:18.429
Welcome back, Mr. Reed.

22:18.501 --> 22:21.732
Expect to make up
the test tomorrow.

22:21.804 --> 22:26.298
Mr. Harden, you're here
on time for a change.

22:26.375 --> 22:28.605
What's this?

22:28.677 --> 22:32.204
- Self-explanatory, isn't it?
- I got every answer right.

22:32.281 --> 22:36.240
- Not because you knew the material.
- You sayin' I cheated? How?

22:36.318 --> 22:38.252
I have no idea how.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.982
But you did.
And I won't tolerate it.

22:48.297 --> 22:50.959
[Man]
Back to business, people.

22:51.033 --> 22:53.433
- [Door Opens, Closes]
- Mr. Guider?

22:53.502 --> 22:55.800
How do I tell Max
that I want out?

22:55.871 --> 22:59.602
I wish I could
help you, Tony.

22:59.675 --> 23:01.768
I can't even help myself.

23:31.340 --> 23:33.274
[Boy]
Babbit!

23:35.211 --> 23:37.111
[Screams]

23:54.029 --> 23:55.894
[Screaming]

24:01.170 --> 24:03.365
[Girl]
Oh, my God!

24:13.082 --> 24:16.210
Excuse me, please.
Thank you.

24:19.221 --> 24:21.587
Just stay back.

24:23.759 --> 24:27.126
I'll show you my theory
if you show me yours.

24:27.196 --> 24:30.529
Based on the eyewitness accounts
of the students I spoke to,

24:30.599 --> 24:34.433
at this moment I'd have to say
that I don't have one.

24:35.971 --> 24:38.439
What about for
these globs of goo?

24:38.507 --> 24:40.566
- The ones we found in the evidence room?
- Yeah.

24:40.643 --> 24:43.544
I'm guessing Max Harden could tell us
how they got there.

24:43.612 --> 24:46.137
You think Max did this?
Based on what?

24:46.215 --> 24:49.946
I spoke to a few students
myself. Apparently Max
was angry at Mr. Babbit...

24:50.019 --> 24:52.988
because he failed him
on his midterm exam, so he had motive.

24:53.055 --> 24:56.286
Well, he may have had motive,
but he didn't have opportunity.

24:56.358 --> 24:58.792
There was nobody here
who saw him even go near the victim.

24:58.861 --> 25:02.558
Maybe he didn't need to.
I pulled his records.

25:02.631 --> 25:06.897
Rising attendance and discipline
problems the last few months.
But look at this transcript.

25:06.969 --> 25:10.370
As his behavior was getting worse,
his grades were going through the roof.

25:10.439 --> 25:14.933
- This kid has changed, Scully.
- He's a teenager.
Everything about him is changing.

25:15.010 --> 25:18.878
His body and his brain chemistry
is in a state of unparalleled upheaval,

25:18.948 --> 25:21.917
plus there's peer pressure
and-and substance abuse.

25:21.984 --> 25:24.680
Any one of these factors
could alter his behavior radically.

25:24.753 --> 25:28.211
What if it's given him a kind of
psychokinetic or paranormal ability...

25:28.290 --> 25:32.750
that allows him to exert force
over a victim without ever
laying a finger on him?

25:32.828 --> 25:35.353
- That's your theory?
- Yes, it is.

25:35.431 --> 25:38.229
Soon to be proven as soon
as I get Max in for questioning.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.825
- Agent, you needed to speak
to Sheriff Harden?
- Yeah.

25:40.903 --> 25:43.303
- I want to talk to him about his son.
- He's with him now.

25:43.372 --> 25:48.435
They're taking him
to the emergency room.
Max just collapsed in the parking lot.

25:53.082 --> 25:56.381
You hear about Max?
Is he okay?

25:56.452 --> 26:00.855
- Where are you going?
- Tony, the less you know,
the better, all right?

28:11.186 --> 28:13.746
What, no candy, no flowers?

28:13.822 --> 28:16.586
[Sheriff] My deputy
told me you were comin'and why.

28:16.658 --> 28:21.721
So you can just turn around.
Whatever happened at that school,
my son didn't do it.

28:21.796 --> 28:24.765
Sheriff, we'd like to ask your son
a few questions, if that's okay.

28:24.833 --> 28:28.325
The boy's sick. The doctors
can't even say what's wrong with him.

28:28.403 --> 28:31.839
Max could tell them. You know why
you collapsed, don't you, Max?

28:31.907 --> 28:33.932
Yeah. Too much teen spirit.

28:34.009 --> 28:36.910
You think?
Smells like murder to me.

28:36.978 --> 28:39.845
Who do you think
you're talkin'to here?

28:39.915 --> 28:42.349
Yeah, it's not like you got
a damned thing on me.

28:42.417 --> 28:45.511
You got a problem with
authority figures, don't you, Max?

28:45.587 --> 28:48.920
If I wasted Babbit, then how did
I do it? Am I like Carrie or somethin'?

28:48.990 --> 28:51.288
I used some kind
of mental powers?

28:51.359 --> 28:56.661
No, somethin'else. You fgured
out a way to tap into something
that gives you super powers.

28:56.731 --> 28:59.859
Came in handy with Babbit
and Deputy Foster.

29:01.202 --> 29:03.363
Man, you're whistlin'
"Dixie."

29:03.438 --> 29:05.872
High temperature
and heart rate.

29:05.941 --> 29:09.138
Low blood sugar.
Electrolytes show acidosis.

29:09.210 --> 29:14.807
All these symptoms are consistent
with extreme exertion and withdrawal.

29:14.883 --> 29:17.283
Withdrawal?
From what?

29:17.352 --> 29:21.755
The rush. I think
whatever it is that gives you
the power to rearrange furniture...

29:21.823 --> 29:24.986
and turn a flashlight into a battering
ram also gives you quite a buzz.

29:25.060 --> 29:28.154
Well, if I can do all that,
what's stoppin' me from doin' it to you?

29:28.229 --> 29:30.288
I don't know.

29:30.365 --> 29:32.663
Maybe the effect's
worn off.

29:32.734 --> 29:35.066
Maybe you need
another fix.

29:35.136 --> 29:37.730
As soon as I blow out of here,
I'll be sure to get one.

29:37.806 --> 29:40.001
That's not gonna happen
any time soon.

29:40.075 --> 29:42.509
Your condition's getting worse.

29:42.577 --> 29:45.842
And we're not gonna be able to help you
unless you can tell us what's going on.

29:48.550 --> 29:52.577
Boy, is any of this true?

29:52.654 --> 29:56.818
- No.
- You better pray I don't find out it is.

29:58.493 --> 30:01.291
Sir? Can we have
a word outside?

30:20.482 --> 30:24.179
He's not a bad kid.
He just needs discipline.

30:24.252 --> 30:26.948
If your son is in trouble,
I'm sure you'd want to know about it.

30:27.022 --> 30:30.480
With that in mind, we'd like permission
to search your house.

30:30.558 --> 30:32.492
You're not getting it.

30:32.560 --> 30:37.623
I'm not ready to jump on a bandwagon
and call my boy a murderer.

30:42.037 --> 30:45.666
There's some, uh, test results
missing from Max's chart.

30:45.740 --> 30:48.231
I think we should
track 'em down.

30:50.712 --> 30:52.646
Thanks.

31:00.188 --> 31:02.679
Hot off the presses.

31:03.758 --> 31:06.090
Anything interesting?

31:06.161 --> 31:09.255
- This can't be right.
- What is it?

31:10.398 --> 31:12.628
Oh, my God.

31:12.701 --> 31:14.635
What?

31:14.703 --> 31:18.036
Evidence of cerebral lesions
from repeated concussions.

31:19.808 --> 31:22.572
Arthritis in the spine
and major joints.

31:23.978 --> 31:26.503
Stress fractures.

31:26.581 --> 31:28.811
Numerous muscle and...

31:31.152 --> 31:33.518
- and ligament micro-tears.
- What would cause this?

31:33.588 --> 31:36.557
In a teenager?
I can't even imagine.

31:36.624 --> 31:39.855
This is the kind of thing that you'd see
in someone who's crashed race cars...

31:39.928 --> 31:43.386
or played pro football
for 15 years.

31:45.300 --> 31:48.963
Whatever Max is doing,
it's killing him.

31:50.038 --> 31:52.097
I think I'm starting
to get it.

32:05.820 --> 32:08.311
[Beeping]

32:24.672 --> 32:28.665
- I thought I saw
a young lady come in here.
- I wish.

32:42.824 --> 32:45.588
Max Harden's personal effects.

32:45.660 --> 32:47.594
Yeah.

32:54.335 --> 32:56.496
This is it.
Those globs we found...

32:56.571 --> 32:58.971
this is where
they came from.

33:00.675 --> 33:03.303
Speed, Scully. Somehow Max
Harden has found a way...

33:03.378 --> 33:06.541
- to move faster than the eye can see.
- Mulder.

33:06.614 --> 33:09.913
That would explain how Babbit
was killed. It would also
explain how a chair and table...

33:09.984 --> 33:12.384
appeared to move on their own
with enough force to penetrate a wall.

33:12.453 --> 33:14.648
Force equals mass times acceleration.
Isn't that right?

33:14.722 --> 33:19.159
Yes, but it's impossible. The human body
isn't designed to move like that.

33:19.227 --> 33:22.856
Exactly. That is... That is why
his is falling apart.

33:22.931 --> 33:25.525
Agents, could you...

33:47.222 --> 33:49.486
Max... Max, please don't do this.
You can stop.

33:49.557 --> 33:51.821
Sure. Just like you can.

33:51.893 --> 33:54.259
I mean hurting people.
Haven't enough people already been hurt?

33:54.329 --> 33:57.355
This is not why
I got you out!

33:57.432 --> 34:00.890
- Let's leave here. Let's just go away.
- And do what?

34:00.969 --> 34:03.096
Find a place
to get some help.

34:03.171 --> 34:07.733
Help for what? This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

34:09.444 --> 34:12.208
I can't go back to things
standin' still.

34:13.414 --> 34:15.746
And neither can you.

34:27.027 --> 34:29.860
Tony, what are you
doing here?

34:29.931 --> 34:32.263
You went in that cave,
didn't you?

34:32.333 --> 34:34.301
You shouldn't have done that.

34:35.904 --> 34:40.068
It was such a rush...
moving fast like that.

34:40.141 --> 34:44.407
I didn't want this for you.
How did you find it?

34:44.478 --> 34:48.040
I followed you.
I was worried about you.

34:48.116 --> 34:50.880
That's so sweet.

34:50.952 --> 34:55.446
I wish things were different
than how they are.

34:55.523 --> 35:00.483
Maybe they can be. With Max in
the hospital, we could go to the cops.

35:02.830 --> 35:04.764
He's out.

36:08.394 --> 36:10.328
Oh, my God.

36:10.396 --> 36:12.660
[Door Opens]

36:21.708 --> 36:23.642
Hello?

36:44.597 --> 36:47.191
Boo.

36:56.342 --> 36:58.503
You killed Ron Foster.

36:59.579 --> 37:01.706
Yeah, I did.

37:01.781 --> 37:04.011
Why?

37:04.083 --> 37:07.450
I don't know.
You want some great reason?

37:07.520 --> 37:11.081
You little son of a bitch!
[Groans]

37:11.157 --> 37:13.853
He thought he was
really somethin'.

37:13.926 --> 37:16.360
Always liked to
push people around.

37:16.429 --> 37:20.365
Same as Babbit...
and same as you.

37:21.701 --> 37:23.635
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

37:30.309 --> 37:33.176
I can't let you do this, Max.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.714
- Take him to O.R. One.
- All right.

37:49.295 --> 37:51.229
Yo, Scully.

37:54.233 --> 37:56.201
How bad are his injuries?

37:56.269 --> 37:59.727
It's too soon to tell. He's unconscious
and bleeding internally,

37:59.806 --> 38:01.967
apparently from a blow
to the abdomen.

38:02.041 --> 38:06.671
Yeah, delivered with this.
Max's weapon of choice against cops.

38:06.746 --> 38:10.045
Why would he leave it behind? Do you
think he's doing it to taunt the police?

38:10.116 --> 38:12.209
No, I think somebody intervened.

38:12.285 --> 38:15.880
I think that's why the sheriff is
still alive and why his gun is missing.

38:15.955 --> 38:20.016
But if he can do what you claim, then...
then who could possibly intervene?

38:20.092 --> 38:23.619
The someone who knows exactly
how Max does what he does.

38:23.696 --> 38:26.221
And someone who's finally
standing up to him.

38:26.299 --> 38:28.563
Tony. How do we find him?

38:28.634 --> 38:32.035
Well, I would guess the source
where Max gets his power from.

38:32.104 --> 38:35.301
The woods near where
the deputy was killed.

38:35.374 --> 38:37.899
Tony never came clean
about what he was doing out there.

38:37.977 --> 38:41.003
Well, maybe that's why
the deputy was killed.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.241
Maybe he got too close
to the truth.

38:46.152 --> 38:48.643
[Tony] Chastity,
we don't have to be doing this.

38:48.721 --> 38:50.848
I told you, I took care
of things with Max.

38:50.923 --> 38:53.687
No, you didn't,
and you shouldn't have tried.

38:53.759 --> 38:57.320
- He was gonna kill his father.
I had to stop him.
- He let you.

38:57.396 --> 38:59.762
He was slowing down.
Tony, you've slowed down too.

38:59.832 --> 39:02.699
If we don't get back to the cave
before Max does, we're history.

39:24.423 --> 39:27.654
- Hurry!
- I'll catch up.

39:59.725 --> 40:02.216
Chastity?

40:02.295 --> 40:04.263
Are you okay?

40:04.330 --> 40:06.560
[Max]
You're late, kid.

40:07.867 --> 40:10.734
- What did you do to her?
- She took a swing at me.

40:10.803 --> 40:14.762
You believe that?
You got it all turned around.

40:21.881 --> 40:24.247
[Groans]

40:28.254 --> 40:30.188
Come on, man.

40:32.058 --> 40:35.494
Who do you think
you're dealin' with?

40:40.099 --> 40:43.125
All I ever wanted was
you to be my friend, Tony.

40:43.202 --> 40:45.136
You stuck a knife
in my back.

40:47.106 --> 40:49.597
And now I'm gonna
mess you up.

40:49.675 --> 40:53.304
[Screaming]

41:02.955 --> 41:04.786
I'm sorry, Tony.

41:04.857 --> 41:06.882
I can't go back.

41:15.134 --> 41:17.329
[Gun Blast]

41:44.263 --> 41:46.493
Chastity?

41:52.905 --> 41:55.169
[Beeping]

42:00.179 --> 42:03.342
[Footsteps]

42:10.589 --> 42:13.023
Did the U.S.G.S. Show up?

42:13.092 --> 42:17.188
Eighteen geologists
and three semis full of gear.
They covered every inch of that cave.

42:17.263 --> 42:20.630
- And what'd they come up with?
- Nothing.

42:20.699 --> 42:23.759
A little bat guano and above normal
magnetic field readings,

42:23.836 --> 42:26.896
but nothing that would
cause a physiological effect.

42:26.972 --> 42:29.133
- What'd you expect them to find, Mulder?
- I don't know.

42:29.208 --> 42:31.267
A vortex like the one
in Oregon.

42:31.343 --> 42:34.312
Gravitational aberrations,
unique chemical compositions,

42:34.380 --> 42:38.043
relics that would indicate
the cave was a sacred site.

42:38.117 --> 42:40.051
Something. Anything.
I don't know.

42:40.119 --> 42:44.215
You and I were both in there,
and nothing happened to us.
We're still slow-poking around.

42:44.290 --> 42:46.656
What if we're too old?

42:46.725 --> 42:49.387
You said teenagers differ...

42:49.462 --> 42:51.930
from adults chemically
and physiologically.

42:51.997 --> 42:54.090
What if whatever's in that cave
effects only them?

42:54.166 --> 42:56.691
Well, that's doubtful.

42:56.769 --> 42:59.260
But no more so
than any other theory.

42:59.338 --> 43:01.636
I mean,
it's worth checking out.

43:01.707 --> 43:03.698
Yeah?
Well, we can't.

43:03.776 --> 43:06.540
As of an hour ago,
they pumped concrete into the cave,

43:06.612 --> 43:09.240
sealed it for
precautionary reasons.

43:09.315 --> 43:11.249
We'll never know.

43:13.018 --> 43:15.418
How's he doin'?

43:15.488 --> 43:18.286
Bruises and
muscle strains mostly.

43:18.357 --> 43:22.293
He'll recover.
Go back to being a normal kid.

44:23.189 --> 44:25.191
[Child]
I made this!

44:26.305 --> 44:32.602
