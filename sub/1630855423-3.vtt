WEBVTT

00:06.134 --> 00:08.761
Carrie! Carrie!

00:09.679 --> 00:10.888
Carrie!

00:11.430 --> 00:12.473
I'll call you back.

00:12.557 --> 00:14.267
Lisette! Hi.

00:15.393 --> 00:18.104
-Hey.
-Hey, it's so funny to see you here.

00:18.187 --> 00:19.856
I know. I thought you only existed

00:19.939 --> 00:22.775
in the vestibule
of our apartment building.

00:22.859 --> 00:24.360
-Whatcha doin' here?
-Embarrassingly,

00:24.444 --> 00:27.613
I'm here watching them set up
the party tents for my jewelry show.

00:27.697 --> 00:31.075
Hey, you're one of Bulgari's
three new designers to watch.

00:31.159 --> 00:33.786
There is nothing embarrassing about that.

00:33.870 --> 00:36.998
Plus, Bryant Park,
former home to Fashion Week?

00:37.081 --> 00:38.583
That's hallowed ground.

00:39.041 --> 00:40.293
You are coming Friday night, right?

00:40.793 --> 00:42.795
Cocktails in a tent?
That's my wheelhouse.

00:42.879 --> 00:44.881
Good, 'cause you're the only one
I care about.

00:45.465 --> 00:49.218
Well, you and the buyer from Neiman's.
And Saks.

00:49.302 --> 00:50.595
But really just me.

00:51.596 --> 00:53.097
Hey, can I buy you a cappuccino?

00:53.639 --> 00:54.724
Thanks. I gotta run.

00:55.349 --> 00:56.642
Embarrassingly,
they asked me to record

00:56.726 --> 00:59.729
the audio version of my new book, so...

01:00.271 --> 01:02.148
-Anyway, I'll see you later.
-Okay.

01:03.316 --> 01:04.275
Hey!

01:04.776 --> 01:06.402
You're Carrie Bradshaw.

01:06.486 --> 01:08.237
Nothing embarrassing about that.

01:09.781 --> 01:10.990
-Bye.
-Okay.

01:12.742 --> 01:14.702
Rocco, I'm out front a little early.

01:14.786 --> 01:16.204
-Out front?
-Yeah.

01:16.287 --> 01:17.497
-I'm right around the corner.
-'Kay--

01:19.123 --> 01:20.666
Hey! Stop him!

01:20.750 --> 01:22.710
He stole my purse! Help me!

01:22.794 --> 01:26.255
Why is no one helping?
Why are you just standing there?

01:28.549 --> 01:30.051
He stole my purse!

01:30.134 --> 01:31.052
Oh, okay. It's alright.

01:32.428 --> 01:33.346
Hello, you.

01:33.429 --> 01:36.432
That low-life motherfucker.

01:36.974 --> 01:38.351
Can you be more specific?

01:38.434 --> 01:40.061
Someone just stole my Birkin.

01:40.144 --> 01:43.564
-No! Where?
-Right in front of my goddamn townhouse.

01:43.648 --> 01:47.485
Like, in broad daylight.
What's happening to this city?

01:47.568 --> 01:48.986
So, I'm circling the block

01:49.070 --> 01:51.364
in case he took my wallet
and ditched the bag,

01:51.447 --> 01:52.615
like they used to.

01:52.698 --> 01:56.619
Nah.
Everyone's clued in these days.

01:56.702 --> 01:58.329
-Are you okay?
-Not really.

01:58.412 --> 02:00.706
Like, I splurged on that bag

02:00.790 --> 02:03.793
as a gift to myself
after my very first big sale.

02:03.876 --> 02:07.964
I mean, I bought it so long ago,
there wasn't even a waitlist.

02:08.047 --> 02:11.634
And I want to assure you,
the school now has four more

02:11.717 --> 02:13.344
safety guards at each corner.

02:13.970 --> 02:17.890
Is Miranda more of a flower person
or the food-basket type?

02:17.974 --> 02:21.561
I wanna get her a really nice
thank you gift for connecting me with Nya.

02:21.644 --> 02:25.356
-She's doing my doc tomorrow.
-That's so exciting!

02:25.440 --> 02:27.483
Miranda is definitely more of a foodie

02:27.567 --> 02:29.944
but she is still in LA with Che.

02:30.027 --> 02:31.529
-I can get you that address.
-Yes!

02:31.612 --> 02:32.530
Okay.

02:32.613 --> 02:34.824
...to an incident

02:34.907 --> 02:38.578
that's put the entire
Arbor community at risk.

02:38.661 --> 02:44.500
Some of our students
have created a MILF list.

02:44.584 --> 02:48.796
-We are totally getting that list.
-100%.

02:49.297 --> 02:52.133
Does someone have something to add?

02:54.719 --> 02:55.970
-No.
-No?

02:56.053 --> 02:58.014
Because you seem very chatty.

02:59.432 --> 03:01.976
Good. I'm glad we're on the same page.

03:02.059 --> 03:04.645
"It was the kind of day
that would've fallen

03:04.729 --> 03:08.274
into the 'forgotten' file
if it had ended any other way."

03:08.357 --> 03:10.359
I keep messing that up.
I'm so sorry, you guys.

03:10.443 --> 03:13.738
-That's okay. I got it on the other take.
-Okay.

03:13.821 --> 03:17.241
You wanna take a breath or stretch
before we move on to chapter three?

03:17.325 --> 03:19.744
Nope. No, thanks.
I don't need to, thank you.

03:19.827 --> 03:21.537
You are doing so great.

03:21.621 --> 03:23.915
You're still sure you don't wanna
hire an actress?

03:23.998 --> 03:27.126
You know, like, Julianne Moore,
Julianna Margulies?

03:27.210 --> 03:28.628
Any of the Juliannes?

03:28.711 --> 03:30.254
Look, actresses were fine
for your other books

03:30.338 --> 03:32.965
but a memoir this personal
needs to be read by the author.

03:33.049 --> 03:35.802
Carrie, you're still
poppin' your P's a little.

03:35.885 --> 03:39.055
Jimmy's coming in
for another mic adjustment.

03:39.138 --> 03:42.183
-Oh, God, the B.O.
-Oh, no, really? I didn't notice it.

03:42.266 --> 03:43.559
Wait till he lifts his arms.

03:43.643 --> 03:45.102
I can fix the mic!

03:47.772 --> 03:50.399
Okay, just doin' a little adjustment.

03:52.527 --> 03:55.404
-Thank you.
-Oh, and Gary

03:55.488 --> 03:57.949
wants you to make sure you hit your T's.

03:58.407 --> 04:01.994
You're swallowing them.
Forgotten, not "forgodden."

04:02.078 --> 04:03.663
Swallowing them?

04:03.746 --> 04:06.749
-Yeah.
-Forgotten. Yeah. Thank you.

04:07.458 --> 04:08.668
Peace out.

04:10.837 --> 04:11.838
Oh, my God.

04:11.921 --> 04:13.506
We're the ones who need a mask.

04:13.589 --> 04:15.049
Okay, I'm gonna do something about that.

04:15.133 --> 04:17.093
No, no, no, it's okay.
Honestly, it's okay.

04:17.176 --> 04:18.678
I can survive the two days.

04:18.761 --> 04:20.763
Heroic, but we booked for five.

04:22.056 --> 04:23.474
Five days?

04:24.058 --> 04:27.478
My God, any of the Juliannes
could've banged this out in two.

04:27.562 --> 04:29.605
It's a book about your husband passing.

04:29.939 --> 04:33.568
We wanna make sure you have enough time.
Okay? It's a lot.

04:33.651 --> 04:35.987
Okay. Are we ready

04:36.070 --> 04:37.405
-for chapter three?
-Yep.

04:37.488 --> 04:38.656
I'm gonna go get you some mint tea.

04:38.739 --> 04:40.324
Amanda, thanks, but I don't,

04:40.408 --> 04:42.493
I don't want you here
waiting on me every day.

04:43.035 --> 04:43.870
I wish.

04:43.953 --> 04:46.247
Sadly, it's back to
the publisher mines for me,

04:46.330 --> 04:49.750
but I texted you Gary's info
in case you have any problems.

04:49.834 --> 04:51.252
-Okay?
-Okay.

04:51.752 --> 04:53.463
Where am I?

04:53.546 --> 04:54.964
Chapter three.

04:55.339 --> 04:56.632
'Kay. Ready.

04:56.716 --> 04:58.050
Recording.

04:58.509 --> 05:00.136
"Chapter Three.

05:00.845 --> 05:03.139
"I came home from the Manhattan
School of Music

05:03.222 --> 05:06.601
"with Beethoven's concerto
still ringing in my ears.

05:07.310 --> 05:10.438
"The sound of the running
shower greeted me.

05:10.521 --> 05:12.523
As I called John's name, I worried--"

05:12.607 --> 05:15.818
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I missed a word.

05:15.902 --> 05:18.029
-You okay there?
-Yeah.

05:18.112 --> 05:21.115
Yeah, I guess I haven't
looked at this in a while.

05:22.450 --> 05:24.202
"Remember worrying"?

05:26.871 --> 05:29.499
"I remember worrying--" Wait.

05:30.333 --> 05:31.667
What? That's confusing.

05:32.418 --> 05:34.378
No problem. Let's just start again.

05:35.213 --> 05:36.130
Okay.

05:42.512 --> 05:43.930
"Chapter Three.

05:44.430 --> 05:46.808
"I came home from the Manhattan
School of Music

05:46.891 --> 05:50.520
"with Beethoven's concerto

05:51.145 --> 05:54.607
The sound of the running shower
greeted me as I called--"

05:54.690 --> 05:57.610
See, this sentence is
so long I wish I could

05:58.236 --> 06:00.947
cut from here to,

06:01.656 --> 06:05.284
"We had a two-hour drive ahead of us."
Is it okay if I do that?

06:05.368 --> 06:09.122
Actually, no, it's not okay.
They need you to read what's published.

06:09.330 --> 06:11.958
Well, that's a shame
'cause it's really clunky.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.752
I mean, who wrote this thing anyway?

06:15.586 --> 06:16.754
-Go again.
-Okay.

06:16.838 --> 06:19.048
-Top of chapter three.
-Okay.

06:25.388 --> 06:27.223
"Chapter Three.

06:28.558 --> 06:31.269
"I came home from the Manhattan

"The sound of the running

06:36.482 --> 06:37.733
"As I called John's name,

06:37.817 --> 06:40.611
"I remember worrying
about the lateness of the hour.

06:40.695 --> 06:43.489
"We had a two-hour drive
ahead of us, after all,

06:43.573 --> 06:45.533
and time was very important to John."

06:45.616 --> 06:48.161
Okay, yeah, sorry I did that.
I swallow-- I did the--

06:48.244 --> 06:50.413
I swallowed the "t" on "important."

06:50.496 --> 06:52.123
Yeah, I'm sorry. That's on me.

06:52.415 --> 06:55.418
And, Carrie, I think you can really afford
to slow down.

06:55.501 --> 06:58.546
Take your time.
We've got five days in here.

06:58.629 --> 07:00.465
Yep. That's what I hear.

07:00.548 --> 07:03.259
"How is it going, my little cannoli?"

07:03.342 --> 07:05.761
-"Dad, can you please not call me that?"
-"So what?

07:05.845 --> 07:08.139
"I'm not allowed to call you
my little cannoli anymore?

07:08.222 --> 07:09.807
"Who am I offending now?

07:09.891 --> 07:10.975
"Pastry or cream?

07:11.058 --> 07:11.934
"I need to talk to--"

07:12.018 --> 07:13.186
-That's my line.
-I'm sorry.

07:13.269 --> 07:14.395
It's okay.

07:14.479 --> 07:15.480
"I need to talk to you."

07:15.563 --> 07:17.064
-"It's not about a nickname--"
-Wait.

07:17.148 --> 07:18.733
Wait, I'm sorry.

07:19.317 --> 07:22.069
The type got all small again.
I hate this new phone.

07:22.153 --> 07:24.447
Can't they just print
these pages out for you?

07:25.448 --> 07:28.326
Not when it's a new scene I just got
that we're rehearsing in an hour.

07:29.744 --> 07:32.622
Okay, let's go from where the dad sits.

07:32.705 --> 07:34.874
You mean, after you start crying?

07:35.708 --> 07:38.169
Well, I don't necessarily have to cry.
It's not set in stone.

07:38.252 --> 07:41.506
Well, it says down here,
"Che begins to cry."

07:41.589 --> 07:45.092
And then, "Che cries harder."
And then, the dad says, "Don't cry."

07:45.176 --> 07:46.344
So, I think you have to cry.

07:46.427 --> 07:48.012
Can we please just run the lines?

07:48.095 --> 07:49.555
Oh, yeah, sure. Okay.

07:50.807 --> 07:52.600
"What do I care what you call yourself?

07:53.059 --> 07:57.146
You wanna be non-binary, be non-binary.
I just don't wanna lose my little girl."

07:57.230 --> 07:59.190
"You're not losing me. I'm still me."

07:59.273 --> 08:01.776
"Come on, cannoli. Don't cry.

08:02.443 --> 08:05.488
You know I can't handle it when you cry."

08:05.571 --> 08:06.823
Do you wanna try to cry?

08:06.906 --> 08:09.492
-No. No, I don't, Miranda.
-Okay, alright.

08:09.575 --> 08:13.246
Because if I cry, it sends a signal
that being non-binary is a tragedy

08:13.329 --> 08:15.331
and that I'm not happy, which I am.

08:15.706 --> 08:17.959
Correction. Which I was until I got this

08:18.918 --> 08:20.378
fake-ass shitty scene.

08:20.461 --> 08:22.547
Well, then just tell 'em you won't do it.

08:22.630 --> 08:24.882
No, I've already told them
that I won't have blue hair,

08:25.341 --> 08:29.470
or wear a zoot suit,
or do 10 lame they/them jokes.

08:29.554 --> 08:30.555
I--

08:31.889 --> 08:33.683
This is supposed to be me, and--

08:34.725 --> 08:35.726
Fuck.

08:37.437 --> 08:39.147
Che, what can I do?

08:42.483 --> 08:44.944
-I'm okay.
-You're gonna be great!

08:45.027 --> 08:48.114
And you've still got three days
till the taping,

08:48.197 --> 08:51.409
and I'll be there cheering you on.

08:51.492 --> 08:52.326
Right?

08:54.328 --> 08:57.165
-Right.
-Yeah.

08:58.541 --> 09:00.460
Alright, come on.
I'll drop you off at your meeting

09:00.543 --> 09:02.837
-on the way to the studio.
-Okay. Thanks.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.505
-Goddamnit!
-What?

09:04.589 --> 09:06.466
How could I miss a call
when the ringer is on?

09:06.549 --> 09:08.593
This android has a mind of its own.

09:08.676 --> 09:11.721
I can't believe I let the sales person
talk me into it.

09:11.804 --> 09:13.764
And why is Brady ghosting me?

09:13.848 --> 09:15.850
-I haven't heard from him in days.
-Relax.

09:15.933 --> 09:17.810
He's with his girlfriend
in Europe having fun.

09:17.894 --> 09:19.270
Yeah, but--

09:19.353 --> 09:20.688
But that phone is real annoying.

09:20.772 --> 09:22.857
-Get it checked.
-Yeah, I will.

09:23.900 --> 09:24.734
Come here.

09:28.070 --> 09:29.405
And,

09:29.489 --> 09:31.532
that's how I became a professor
at Columbia Law School.

09:31.616 --> 09:33.367
-Really great, Nya.
-Really?

09:33.451 --> 09:35.536
Yes. Now, I wanna double back

09:35.620 --> 09:37.622
and get some more of your feelings about

09:37.705 --> 09:40.041
-Constance Baker Motley.
-Well, I mean,

09:40.124 --> 09:43.169
how did one woman break all those race
and gender barriers?

09:44.086 --> 09:45.588
She was a--

09:47.632 --> 09:50.301
-I think my mic slipped down.
-Bryan.

09:50.384 --> 09:52.261
-Yeah, I'm on it.
-I'm sorry. I--

09:52.345 --> 09:54.013
-No, it's okay. It's fine.
-I'll get that for you.

09:55.765 --> 09:56.641
Pardon my reach.

09:56.724 --> 09:58.601
-I just gotta look for the culprit.
-Oh yeah, sure. Of course, yeah.

10:02.855 --> 10:04.315
Shouldn't you buy me dinner first?

10:04.398 --> 10:06.943
You know what?
I really think we got it

10:07.026 --> 10:10.113
and we're running over,
so I think we can just wrap it up.

10:10.196 --> 10:12.865
Copy.
If you might-- Oh, okay.

10:13.491 --> 10:14.992
Let me just get it right here.

10:16.577 --> 10:17.578
There it is.

10:20.289 --> 10:21.582
Were you serious about that dinner?

10:21.666 --> 10:24.460
What? No, I was just joking.

10:25.253 --> 10:26.504
That's too bad.

10:30.466 --> 10:31.676
Hey.

10:33.594 --> 10:35.847
Can I talk to you about your sound guy?

10:35.930 --> 10:38.182
Bryan? Oh, he's fine, right?

10:38.641 --> 10:41.227
That was a little bit extra, am I right?

10:41.310 --> 10:43.062
Well, let's just say
he didn't go mic-fishing

10:43.146 --> 10:45.314
on the circuit court judge
I interviewed yesterday.

10:45.773 --> 10:47.150
Okay, well, my husband
and I just separated,

10:47.233 --> 10:49.569
so my mind isn't working that way yet,

10:49.652 --> 10:52.029
but did you see his arms in that shirt?

10:53.948 --> 10:55.366
I think your mind is working that way,

10:55.450 --> 10:58.286
so why don't you give him your number,
and make it quick,

10:58.369 --> 10:59.662
because we are late for lunch.

10:59.745 --> 11:02.039
That's a wrap, everybody.
I'll see you Thursday.

11:02.123 --> 11:04.959
-How's the book taping going?
-Well, day two and, apparently,

11:05.042 --> 11:08.087
I'm still popping my P's
and swallowing my T's.

11:08.171 --> 11:10.506
Turns out, talking, not so easy.

11:10.590 --> 11:13.885
Aside from the P's and the T's,
how are you doing?

11:13.968 --> 11:16.512
It can't be easy reliving everything.

11:17.722 --> 11:21.559
Just so you know, if you ever need me
to come up there for support, I am there.

11:22.602 --> 11:23.978
I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:24.061 --> 11:26.022
With the exception of this fast-breaking
speech problem,

11:26.105 --> 11:27.482
I'm doin' pretty well.

11:27.565 --> 11:29.650
You are doing really well.

11:29.734 --> 11:32.028
I was just saying this to Miranda.

11:32.111 --> 11:35.406
The way you've moved on,
we're so proud of you.

11:36.949 --> 11:40.286
Here they come.
I thought maybe they had forgotten.

11:41.954 --> 11:44.415
-Hi! I'm sorry.
-Hi! It's okay.

11:44.499 --> 11:46.292
-Don't worry about it.
-I'm so sorry I'm late.

11:46.375 --> 11:48.085
Hi. You smell good.

11:48.169 --> 11:49.587
It was all my fault.

11:49.670 --> 11:52.423
Yeah, she was just so damn compelling,
we went into overtime.

11:52.507 --> 11:55.218
Well, hurry up. Look at your menus.
We've been stalling.

11:55.301 --> 11:57.220
Wait! I got it!

11:57.762 --> 12:00.097
-I got the list!
-Ordering can wait.

12:00.181 --> 12:02.850
-Wait, I can't open it.
-Wait, what list?

12:02.934 --> 12:06.312
Okay, this is gonna sound silly,
but there's a whole brouhaha at school

12:06.395 --> 12:09.398
about this MILF list that a kid started.

12:09.482 --> 12:12.276
-A what? A MILF list? For real?
-Yes.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.945
It's basically MILF-gate.

12:14.028 --> 12:16.322
Okay, okay. Here we go.
Downloading, baby.

12:16.405 --> 12:18.950
-How did you get it?
-I will never reveal my sources.

12:19.033 --> 12:21.828
You two are like a regular
Woodward and Bernstein.

12:21.911 --> 12:25.623
For the record, I do think it's wrong
that in this day and age,

12:25.706 --> 12:28.417
women are still being judged
solely for the--

12:28.501 --> 12:32.505
Here it is! We're number two and three!

12:34.382 --> 12:36.092
I'd switch our order, of course.

12:36.175 --> 12:40.179
No! You totally deserve to be number two!
But who's number one?

12:40.263 --> 12:42.306
Kayla Charles. Finn's stepmom.

12:42.390 --> 12:44.517
-Ooh, yes, she is stunning.
-Yeah.

12:44.600 --> 12:48.729
But don't you think that, technically,
a stepmom should be on a different list?

12:48.813 --> 12:51.899
Well, Nya,
surely you cover this in your class

12:51.983 --> 12:53.651
on "MILF Law in the 21st Century."

12:54.485 --> 12:55.319
I am sorry.

12:55.403 --> 12:58.823
Our lunchtime fodder is not usually
this lowbrow, I swear.

12:58.906 --> 13:00.575
Really? Who have you been eating with?

13:00.658 --> 13:02.118
Oh no, listen, I'm enjoying it,

13:02.201 --> 13:03.911
but maybe we should switch gears
and, I don't know,

13:03.995 --> 13:04.871
talk about abortion rights,

13:04.954 --> 13:07.081
or how our democracy
is hanging by a thread,

13:07.165 --> 13:08.749
or how our planet is dying.

13:12.086 --> 13:13.629
Hot sound guy just texted me.

13:15.840 --> 13:20.845
"John lifted his head and looked up at me
from the shower floor.

13:22.013 --> 13:23.723
"Time stopped.

13:24.932 --> 13:26.559
"I couldn't move.

13:28.060 --> 13:30.480
It felt like I stood there for hours."

13:36.235 --> 13:39.155
-Is she taking a pause, or?
-I don't know.

13:40.239 --> 13:42.325
"But it was only a moment--"

13:42.408 --> 13:43.284
That was a pause.

13:43.367 --> 13:46.496
Hey, Carrie,
I think maybe it's too slow now.

13:46.579 --> 13:48.206
-Okay.
-Maybe split the difference

13:48.289 --> 13:49.707
moving forward.

13:49.791 --> 13:52.585
Let's do that same section
about how long you waited,

13:52.668 --> 13:54.295
but without waiting so long.

13:56.255 --> 13:57.465
Recording.

14:00.301 --> 14:03.304
"John lifted his head

14:05.807 --> 14:08.226
"and looked up at me
from the shower floor.

14:16.734 --> 14:18.361
"Time stopped.

14:20.238 --> 14:21.864
"I couldn't move.

14:26.994 --> 14:29.622
"It felt like I stood there for hours.

14:31.791 --> 14:33.751
"But it was only a moment.

14:41.509 --> 14:44.720
"He looked so small.

14:51.894 --> 14:56.524
I'd forgotten how big he was."

14:57.942 --> 15:01.320
Guys, I think it's bad for the author
to be this emotional.

15:01.404 --> 15:02.989
You know, it just--

15:06.033 --> 15:08.244
It feels...

15:09.537 --> 15:12.248
-unprofessional.
-Agreed.

15:12.331 --> 15:14.250
Why don't we just skip
chapter three for now,

15:14.333 --> 15:16.669
-and we'll come back to it another time?
-Okay.

15:16.752 --> 15:17.920
Okay, yeah. Let's just--

15:18.004 --> 15:21.257
We'll skip chapter three for now.
We'll come back to it.

15:22.467 --> 15:25.052
-But I hit those T's on "forgotten."
-You did!

15:25.136 --> 15:26.137
Yeah, definitely.

15:26.220 --> 15:27.930
-Definitely heard that. Yeah.
-Definitely heard it.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.933
-Okay.
-Chapter four.

15:45.239 --> 15:49.076
-Oh, you scared me.
-Carrie! Carrie!

15:50.828 --> 15:52.622
Bitsy. Hi.

15:52.705 --> 15:55.333
-Come, come! Sit!
-Yeah? Okay.

15:55.875 --> 15:58.044
-Hi.
-Is my upper lip still red raw?

15:58.127 --> 16:02.215
-No. No, no, no. Not, not really.
-You're too kind.

16:02.298 --> 16:05.551
A $100,000 facelift
and I still have to come here

16:05.635 --> 16:08.012
for a $25 mustache wax.

16:08.095 --> 16:09.972
God's clearly a man.

16:10.056 --> 16:14.977
So, what fabulous thing are you
on your way to or coming home from?

16:15.812 --> 16:18.564
Nothing fabulous.
No, I was recording my new book.

16:18.648 --> 16:20.983
Yes! Loved & Lost.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.860
I just preordered it, Buttercup.

16:22.944 --> 16:25.029
-Thank you.
-I can't wait to see what keen

16:25.113 --> 16:28.741
Carrie Bradshaw perspective
you have for me and all those other ladies

16:28.825 --> 16:31.035
out there who have lost a husband.

16:31.452 --> 16:34.372
Well, I don't know about any perspective.

16:34.455 --> 16:35.790
I just...

16:38.167 --> 16:40.086
I just fell apart reading it.

16:40.586 --> 16:43.131
I was suddenly right back there again.

16:44.215 --> 16:45.883
It was embarrassing.

16:46.968 --> 16:51.430
I thought I was doing so well.
I got through that whole first year.

16:52.765 --> 16:56.853
Honey,
the second year is worse than the first.

16:56.936 --> 17:00.106
That's the dirty,
little secret nobody tells you

17:00.189 --> 17:03.818
because time is passing
and whatever's happening,

17:03.901 --> 17:08.239
you know, good, bad, weird,
he's missing all of it.

17:08.322 --> 17:11.159
So, you feel farther
and farther away from him.

17:11.242 --> 17:12.243
It's...

17:13.202 --> 17:15.121
it's just awful.

17:16.080 --> 17:20.793
But you always,
you always seem so up and about.

17:20.877 --> 17:25.882
Well, I am, some days.
Other days?

17:26.966 --> 17:28.968
I'm just fakin' it, sister.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.596
Well, what's the alternative?

17:31.679 --> 17:33.681
Feeling sorry for myself?

17:34.599 --> 17:36.851
I'll pass along a saying
I heard in my Kabbalah class.

17:36.934 --> 17:38.561
Okay.

17:38.644 --> 17:44.233
"The hole never fills,
but new life will grow around it."

17:44.984 --> 17:50.865
So, your job is to do whatever you need
to plant some seeds.

17:50.948 --> 17:52.992
For me, it was a facelift.

17:53.743 --> 17:57.079
For you, it's probably something else.

17:57.163 --> 18:03.002
But you do whatever you do
to make yourself feel better.

18:38.329 --> 18:41.541
"As I lifted his lifeless body...

18:43.334 --> 18:46.504
into my arms--" No. No way.

19:04.355 --> 19:07.150
Hi. You've reached the cell phone
of Gary Schneider.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.193
Leave me a message.

19:09.819 --> 19:12.530
Hi, Gary. It's Carrie Bradshaw.

19:14.365 --> 19:17.285
I just tested positive for COVID,

19:17.368 --> 19:21.706
so you're gonna have
to get an actress to record it.

19:21.789 --> 19:25.418
I'm so sorry. Thank you. Bye-bye.

19:32.967 --> 19:34.177
Thank you.

19:44.395 --> 19:46.105
Careful not to move.

19:46.773 --> 19:48.775
Yeah, this looks great.

19:50.443 --> 19:54.322
I guess I'm just feeling a need
to commemorate this moment in my life,

19:54.405 --> 19:56.324
to capture it, you know?

19:56.407 --> 20:01.662
To remember who I am right now
and make sure I never, ever slide back

20:01.746 --> 20:03.664
into the person that I don't wanna be.

20:03.748 --> 20:06.417
Like the one who stayed at that corporate
law firm for all those years,

20:06.501 --> 20:09.003
-repressing your wants and needs?
-Exactly!

20:09.086 --> 20:11.631
Like a little robot
billing 80 hours a week.

20:11.714 --> 20:13.424
And for what, Ricky?

20:13.508 --> 20:14.759
Well, you know what I do have?

20:15.676 --> 20:18.888
I have some fun robots.

20:19.472 --> 20:22.183
Check it out. The Jetsons' housekeeper.

20:23.518 --> 20:24.811
Oh, yeah.

20:24.894 --> 20:26.229
Here's my "Lost In Space" guy.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.563
He is popular.

20:29.398 --> 20:31.984
But, what you have to do is something
that's gonna make you

20:32.068 --> 20:34.570
feel most connected to yourself, Miranda.

20:34.654 --> 20:38.783
You're so easy to talk to.
I really appreciate that.

20:49.502 --> 20:53.464
-Hey, California.
-Oh, thank God you picked up!

20:53.548 --> 20:55.299
I'm on the precipice of doing something

20:55.383 --> 20:58.052
either really stupid
or totally liberating.

20:58.136 --> 21:02.431
If this involves
the Church of Scientology--

21:02.515 --> 21:03.641
A tattoo.

21:03.724 --> 21:07.270
A tattoo, okay.
Yep. Should've seen that coming.

21:07.353 --> 21:11.607
And I almost did it,
I really almost did because why not?

21:11.691 --> 21:13.901
What's the big fuckin' deal?
It's a tattoo.

21:13.985 --> 21:15.611
Everybody has them now, right?

21:15.695 --> 21:18.698
Right,
and everyone's also having them removed.

21:18.781 --> 21:21.993
True and I'm scared of commitment.

21:22.910 --> 21:25.746
I can't even pick a background
for my phone.

21:25.830 --> 21:28.833
Ricky thinks it's all connected to my fear
of losing control.

21:29.459 --> 21:31.461
-Miranda?
-Yeah.

21:31.544 --> 21:34.213
It's time for you
to come back to New York.

21:34.297 --> 21:38.509
No! It's fun out here!
It's like pretend-life.

21:38.593 --> 21:39.802
I never want it to end.

21:40.261 --> 21:41.721
So, what about you?

21:41.804 --> 21:43.639
Charlotte says the recording
is going great.

21:43.723 --> 21:45.224
Actually, no.

21:45.308 --> 21:47.059
They had to get an actress.

21:47.810 --> 21:49.687
I wasn't able to finish.

21:49.771 --> 21:52.440
Oh no! Why couldn't you finish?

21:53.775 --> 21:55.401
Turns out,

21:57.612 --> 21:59.113
I have COVID.

21:59.197 --> 22:01.699
You really buried the lede.
COVID!

22:02.366 --> 22:03.785
It finally got you.

22:03.868 --> 22:06.788
Yeah, so much for studying
my blood in a lab.

22:06.871 --> 22:09.540
-So, how are you feeling?
-Zero symptoms.

22:09.624 --> 22:13.419
You know, I wouldn't even know I had it,
except for the test.

22:13.503 --> 22:14.962
No, please don't worry about me.

22:15.046 --> 22:17.548
You have enough to worry about
with your, you know, your tattoo.

22:17.965 --> 22:19.509
What about a robot?

22:19.592 --> 22:22.553
Fine, but nowhere it can be seen.

22:24.597 --> 22:26.974
Did ya think I was gonna get it
on my neck?

22:27.058 --> 22:28.810
I'm not joining a gang out here.

22:28.893 --> 22:30.895
Good. Okay. Bye.

22:45.451 --> 22:46.661
-Hello.
-Miranda told me.

22:46.744 --> 22:49.455
I am so sorry. What can I bring?

22:49.539 --> 22:52.500
Soup, roast chicken?
I'm making basmati rice.

22:52.583 --> 22:54.502
It's all Harry wanted when he had it.

22:54.585 --> 22:57.588
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. I'm fine.

22:57.672 --> 23:00.883
I'm one of the lucky ones,
so please don't worry about me.

23:00.967 --> 23:04.137
-And please don't send anything.
-Too late.

23:04.220 --> 23:06.764
I already messengered over
a box of Varsano's.

23:06.848 --> 23:10.393
They should be there within the hour.
I got the salted caramels you love.

23:10.935 --> 23:12.520
Oh, my God.

23:26.826 --> 23:28.369
Motherfucker.

23:33.708 --> 23:36.669
Jesus Christ!
$24 for gazpacho?

23:36.752 --> 23:40.631
That's $2 worth of soup
and $22 worth of "they have balls."

23:40.715 --> 23:44.802
Another way the city robs you.
You know what the hardest thing is?

23:44.886 --> 23:47.472
That bag had sentimental meaning,
and it's gone.

23:47.555 --> 23:49.307
Yeah, I hear you.

23:49.390 --> 23:51.434
Back in the day, a trick once stole

23:51.517 --> 23:53.728
my father's gold money clip
right in front of me.

23:53.811 --> 23:54.729
Why didn't you stop him?

23:54.812 --> 23:56.314
I was handcuffed to my bed.

23:59.192 --> 24:00.610
I'm texting Carrie.

24:00.693 --> 24:02.570
It's not like her to be this late.

24:21.714 --> 24:24.550
Shit. Forgot.

24:29.472 --> 24:30.306
Carrie's not coming.

24:30.389 --> 24:33.643
She just tested positive for COVID.
Now she's got COVID?

24:33.726 --> 24:35.603
That's very off-trend for her.

24:36.229 --> 24:39.774
Well, I heard the board
has the MILF culprit in there right now,

24:39.857 --> 24:41.400
but they won't identify him.

24:41.484 --> 24:43.319
Shockingly, I heard it was Milo.

24:43.402 --> 24:45.404
-Wait, Milo W.?
-No, Milo H.

24:45.488 --> 24:47.073
The kid who wore his night brace
all through sixth grade,

24:47.156 --> 24:48.533
-even on picture day?
-Yeah, the one who couldn't

24:48.616 --> 24:49.826
say his S's?

24:49.909 --> 24:50.993
Well, the nerds are always the pervs.

24:51.077 --> 24:53.830
You guys, I am not comfortable with this.

24:53.913 --> 24:57.792
I mean,
we are talking about a little boy here.

25:12.181 --> 25:14.684
-Is that Milo H.?
-"H" for hot.

25:18.229 --> 25:20.648
Why do I feel like Blanche DuBois?

25:20.731 --> 25:24.610
The Arbor School needs to send a message
that there is zero tolerance

25:24.694 --> 25:26.821
for misogyny of any kind.

25:26.904 --> 25:29.323
Which is why this breach and punishment

25:29.407 --> 25:31.075
will remain on the student's record

25:31.159 --> 25:33.202
throughout the college
application process.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.913
Really, Greg? On his record?

25:35.997 --> 25:37.665
Yes, Charlotte.

25:38.875 --> 25:40.334
If I may,

25:40.418 --> 25:42.628
isn't that a little extreme?

25:43.504 --> 25:48.593
I mean, given the boy's age
and relatively benign intentions,

25:48.676 --> 25:52.388
is such harsh punishment really warranted?

25:52.472 --> 25:54.557
I have to agree with Charlotte
on this one, Greg.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.392
Isn't this an opportunity for us
to demonstrate

25:56.476 --> 25:58.561
our commitment to restorative justice?

25:59.020 --> 26:01.481
You're just saying that
because you're two and three on the list.

26:02.774 --> 26:03.816
Are we?

26:03.900 --> 26:05.568
Come on! We all saw the list.

26:08.988 --> 26:10.281
Greg.

26:11.324 --> 26:12.408
We think it should be one and two.

26:12.492 --> 26:14.160
It has just come to my attention

26:14.243 --> 26:16.078
that a group of Arbor School mothers

26:16.162 --> 26:20.082
was overheard objectifying
a male student in the hallway.

26:21.250 --> 26:22.668
-Were they?
-Were they?

26:22.752 --> 26:23.711
Yeah.

26:23.795 --> 26:29.801
Welcome to Warner Brothers Studio
for this live studio taping!

26:32.678 --> 26:36.641
Brady? Finally! Hello!
Are you still in Amsterdam?

26:36.724 --> 26:39.227
Mom, where have you been?
I've been calling since yesterday.

26:39.310 --> 26:40.853
-You never answer.
-I'm sorry.

26:40.937 --> 26:43.648
It's this new phone.
I don't hear it ringing half the time.

26:43.731 --> 26:45.817
I called you, like, 10 times.

26:45.900 --> 26:48.861
Are you crying? Brady, what's wrong?

26:48.945 --> 26:50.655
Luisa broke up with me.

26:50.738 --> 26:51.781
What?

26:52.448 --> 26:53.741
-Why?
-I don't know.

26:53.825 --> 26:55.868
She just bolted to Florence. It's over.

26:55.952 --> 26:57.787
Oh, fuck.

26:57.870 --> 27:00.706
-What was that?
-A car almost hit me. I wish it had.

27:00.790 --> 27:04.836
Don't say that!
Honey, you're scaring me.

27:04.919 --> 27:06.379
Did you talk to Dad?

27:06.963 --> 27:08.923
Yeah, but I really wanted you.

27:09.006 --> 27:10.216
Mom, I gotta go.

27:10.299 --> 27:11.425
-I gotta go.
-What?

27:11.509 --> 27:13.136
No, no, no, no, no. Don't hang up!

27:13.219 --> 27:14.929
I'm crying too hard. People are looking.

27:15.012 --> 27:17.014
Let them look. Listen to me.

27:17.473 --> 27:19.600
I want you to get to the hostel safely

27:19.684 --> 27:22.311
and call me from there.
What are you gonna do?

27:22.395 --> 27:23.563
Call you from the hostel.

27:23.646 --> 27:26.649
Good. Call me back. I love you.

27:27.275 --> 27:30.945
All phones must be off
and placed in a locked pouch

27:31.028 --> 27:33.322
until after the taping!

27:33.406 --> 27:37.243
No exceptions! No exceptions!

27:37.618 --> 27:39.328
Phone goes in this pouch.

27:40.329 --> 27:41.164
Phone goes in this pouch.

27:41.789 --> 27:43.082
I don't have a phone.

27:43.166 --> 27:44.500
I lost it on the beach.

27:44.584 --> 27:47.044
And you didn't use Find My
or get a replacement?

27:47.128 --> 27:50.715
It just happened, and honestly,
I've never felt more relaxed in my life.

27:50.798 --> 27:52.300
I hear that.

27:52.383 --> 27:54.886
-Okay, go ahead.
-Okay, thanks.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.054
So excited.

28:11.068 --> 28:14.030
-Hi, Amanda.
-I have good news for you.

28:14.113 --> 28:17.658
-You got a Julianne?
-Better. I got you an extra week.

28:20.119 --> 28:21.412
Hello?

28:22.413 --> 28:23.331
Yeah, I'm here.

28:23.414 --> 28:29.378
Carrie, this book deserves
the authenticity of your voice.

28:29.754 --> 28:34.759
Even though I know it's the last thing
you wanna be putting yourself through.

28:35.384 --> 28:37.303
With the COVID. I mean.

28:38.262 --> 28:41.432
Well, I guess we'll just, you know,
have to see how I feel next week.

28:44.435 --> 28:46.020
Hey, no way.

28:46.104 --> 28:47.563
I mean, do you remember
when your cousin

28:47.647 --> 28:49.107
Lenny came out as gay?

28:49.190 --> 28:51.943
You know, that,
that night right after putt-putt golf?

28:52.026 --> 28:55.071
I was cool with it.
I mean, I was surprised.

28:55.154 --> 28:57.532
You know, for a gay kid,
he could really putt-putt.

28:59.075 --> 29:02.537
Putt-putt, Dad?
Come on. You're not-not getting it.

29:02.620 --> 29:05.665
Well, I may not-not be gettin' it,
but I am-am getting an ulcer.

29:06.374 --> 29:09.127
Come on. Sit down, sit down.
Talk to me, my little cannoli.

29:09.794 --> 29:13.089
Dad, can you please stop calling me that?

29:13.172 --> 29:16.134
What? I'm not allowed to call you
my little cannoli anymore?

29:16.217 --> 29:17.552
Who am I offending now?

29:17.635 --> 29:19.762
The pastry cream or the shell?

29:21.973 --> 29:23.641
I'm trying to be true to myself,

29:23.724 --> 29:25.226
but I'm afraid to let you down.

29:25.309 --> 29:27.061
You're not lettin' me--

29:28.271 --> 29:30.857
Honey,
what do I care what you call yourself?

29:30.940 --> 29:33.484
You wanna be non-binary, be non-binary.

29:33.568 --> 29:35.653
You wanna have a Bob's Big Boy haircut,

29:37.155 --> 29:39.157
that's your hair, not mine.

29:39.907 --> 29:41.909
I just don't wanna lose my little girl.

29:44.829 --> 29:46.831
Dad, you're not losing me.

29:47.290 --> 29:48.416
I'm still me.

29:48.499 --> 29:52.920
And I love whoever you are.

29:55.590 --> 29:57.884
-What, what is that?
-What is that?

29:59.302 --> 30:00.428
Oh, my God!

30:00.511 --> 30:02.305
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Fuck!

30:02.388 --> 30:04.348
-Oh, God. I'm, I'm--
-Are you fucking kidding me?

30:04.432 --> 30:07.852
-I'm so sorry.
-Mom, why are you FaceTiming me?

30:07.935 --> 30:09.771
-You were doing so good, don't worry.
-No phones, everybody!

30:09.854 --> 30:12.690
There are supposed to be
no goddamn phones!

30:12.774 --> 30:14.692
I'm gonna call you back.
Excuse me, sorry.

30:14.776 --> 30:16.444
Pardon me. I'm so sorry.

30:16.527 --> 30:18.362
Excuse me. My son is in crisis.

30:18.446 --> 30:20.031
-I'm in crisis.
-I'm so sorry.

30:20.114 --> 30:22.283
Relax. Relax. Everybody, relax.
Look, come on.

30:22.700 --> 30:25.036
Mistakes happen.
We can do it again, right?

30:25.119 --> 30:29.123
Lady with the phone, just so you know,
you just ruined our big moment

30:29.207 --> 30:31.834
and we're never gonna be able
to get back there

30:31.918 --> 30:35.713
because Che is not an actor,
they're a stand-up.

30:35.797 --> 30:37.340
No, no, no.

30:37.423 --> 30:41.302
I think they're doing an amazing job.

30:41.385 --> 30:42.261
What do you say, everybody?

30:42.345 --> 30:44.263
-A little hand for Che? Come on.
-Oh, no, Tony, Tony, Tony--

30:46.432 --> 30:47.266
Let's do another.

30:47.350 --> 30:49.811
Alright?
Hey, before my sauce burns.

30:49.894 --> 30:52.897
The man, the myth, the lasagna!

30:53.940 --> 30:57.735
Okay. Okay, so, we're gonna go back
to where we were before...

30:57.819 --> 31:01.322
-I believed you.
-...that lady's pants started to ring.

31:01.405 --> 31:04.283
Now, you all remember,
Che was at the table

31:04.367 --> 31:06.077
and she was asking her dad

31:06.160 --> 31:08.329
to accept her for who she is.

31:08.412 --> 31:10.665
For who they really are!

31:10.748 --> 31:12.458
They, they, they, they, they!

31:12.542 --> 31:15.586
No, he didn't explicitly say
he wants to kill himself,

31:15.670 --> 31:18.840
but he said he wished the car had hit him
and I'm freaking out.

31:18.923 --> 31:22.885
First, take a deep breath.
Everything's gonna be okay.

31:22.969 --> 31:25.054
You said that Brady
is flying home late tonight?

31:25.138 --> 31:28.599
Yes. He gets in early tomorrow morning,
New York time,

31:28.683 --> 31:31.727
and I'm on a 8:00 flight tonight from LA.

31:31.811 --> 31:33.146
Do you think I'm overreacting?

31:33.229 --> 31:35.690
No, no, I think this is smart.

31:35.773 --> 31:38.109
But this might just be
a moment that he's in.

31:38.192 --> 31:40.528
It's just so unlike him.

31:40.611 --> 31:44.574
Meanwhile, Che is still taping the pilot
and probably hates me.

31:44.657 --> 31:46.284
Oh, my God, it's such a mess.

31:46.367 --> 31:48.119
Do not worry about Che right now.

31:48.202 --> 31:52.039
You are doing the right thing.
There is nothing more important.

31:52.123 --> 31:54.917
-Thank you for saying that.
-Brady's gonna be okay.

31:55.460 --> 31:58.087
-I love you.
-I love you, too. Bye.

31:58.171 --> 32:02.967
Here's a little-known Warner Brothers'
studio lot fact.

32:04.469 --> 32:05.470
Who--

32:06.179 --> 32:07.346
Who is it?

32:07.430 --> 32:11.142
It's Seema with lunch.
I snuck in with the UPS guy.

32:12.101 --> 32:13.728
Oh, gosh!

32:15.855 --> 32:17.398
Hey.

32:17.482 --> 32:18.691
"Oy Vey"?

32:19.108 --> 32:20.109
I--

32:20.818 --> 32:23.237
I don't have COVID. I faked it.

32:23.321 --> 32:27.116
Good, because this mask is chic,
but definitely not up to code.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.912
Now I feel bad about
lying to my publisher.

32:33.831 --> 32:38.753
And worse,
about lying to my two oldest friends.

32:39.837 --> 32:42.381
But they've already been so there for me.

32:42.465 --> 32:45.635
You know, I just can't
put them through more of this.

32:45.718 --> 32:48.429
There's gotta be like an expiration date

32:48.513 --> 32:51.682
on how much grief you can
ask a friend to support.

32:52.099 --> 32:54.185
Well, not if they're true friends.

32:55.436 --> 32:58.481
I wasn't there for the first round,
but I am now.

32:58.564 --> 32:59.899
I'm all ears.

33:00.441 --> 33:01.943
I hate feeling sorry for myself.

33:02.026 --> 33:06.239
Carrie,
something horrible happened to you.

33:06.322 --> 33:08.866
You are allowed to feel
sorry for yourself.

33:08.950 --> 33:12.203
And if you don't wanna go out
of this house, don't.

33:12.286 --> 33:17.375
Just crawl into that bed, lay down,
pull the covers over your head

33:17.458 --> 33:20.169
and you just feel
whatever you need to feel.

33:20.253 --> 33:21.879
Nope, nope.

33:22.755 --> 33:24.674
I'm not a "take to the bed" type.

33:24.757 --> 33:27.260
I know, girl. You're strong.

33:27.343 --> 33:29.095
I was in a fetal position over a handbag.

33:29.178 --> 33:32.515
No, no, no. Not just a handbag. A Birkin.

33:32.598 --> 33:34.684
It was your Birkin.
It meant something to you.

33:35.143 --> 33:37.019
Not that I'm equating the two losses,

33:37.103 --> 33:38.855
-but I kinda am.
-You kind of are.

33:45.194 --> 33:47.447
Gosh. It's Lisette.

33:48.239 --> 33:52.785
I promised her I'd go to her pop-up
Bulgari show tonight.

33:52.869 --> 33:54.620
-Well, you're not going.
-No, no, no, no. I have to go.

33:54.704 --> 33:57.331
She's, you know, she's a friend.

33:58.040 --> 34:01.169
She doesn't know I have fake COVID.

34:01.919 --> 34:03.171
Okay, Che.

34:03.254 --> 34:05.214
You can wait in your trailer,

34:05.298 --> 34:07.425
and I'll come get you
when they need you for pick-ups.

34:07.508 --> 34:09.051
-Okay.
-Hi.

34:09.135 --> 34:11.804
I tried to get back in,
but they wouldn't let me.

34:12.388 --> 34:13.681
I can't imagine why.

34:13.764 --> 34:15.475
Could we?

34:15.558 --> 34:18.352
Yeah, yeah.
Beth, do you mind giving us a second?

34:18.436 --> 34:20.062
Sure thing. You want this?

34:20.146 --> 34:21.355
-It's pretty sunny--
-No, thank you.

34:21.439 --> 34:22.690
Okay.

34:22.774 --> 34:25.359
Listen, I'm really sorry.

34:25.443 --> 34:27.779
-That was awful.
-Yes, it was.

34:28.571 --> 34:31.991
Brady called me sounding suicidal.
He's been trying to reach me for days.

34:32.074 --> 34:34.327
Luisa broke up with him in Amsterdam.

34:34.410 --> 34:36.871
I've never heard him cry like that.
It scared me.

34:36.954 --> 34:39.415
And I was so afraid to miss another call.

34:39.499 --> 34:41.334
You ruined the family scene!

34:41.793 --> 34:45.797
Well, I had my own family scene,
and it was real.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.757
-Oh. Okay.
-So,

34:47.840 --> 34:49.717
I'm not gonna be able to see the rest
of the show.

34:49.801 --> 34:53.137
I'm on an eight o'clock flight
and, hopefully, I'll beat Brady home.

34:53.221 --> 34:55.348
Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.
You're leaving LA?

34:55.431 --> 34:57.475
-Yeah.
-Miranda, let's just--

34:57.892 --> 34:59.977
Let's just calm down, alright?

35:00.061 --> 35:03.439
It's a kid, and it's a breakup,
and it's part of life.

35:03.523 --> 35:07.610
Okay, but it's my kid.
The most important thing to me.

35:07.985 --> 35:09.237
You don't know what that feels like.

35:11.948 --> 35:13.741
Then I guess we're even.

35:13.825 --> 35:15.118
Hey.

35:15.201 --> 35:17.787
Sorry.
They want you in hair and makeup

35:17.870 --> 35:19.705
-for touch-ups now.
-Yeah, no problem, no problem.

35:21.499 --> 35:22.625
Do what you gotta do.

35:23.501 --> 35:24.418
Che!

35:25.169 --> 35:27.171
I'm really, really sorry.

35:28.256 --> 35:30.925
Could we not say goodbye
on a yucky note like this?

35:31.008 --> 35:32.844
Yeah. Okay.

35:34.053 --> 35:37.807
Sure. I hope that Brady's okay, alright?
I really do. I do.

35:37.890 --> 35:40.560
-Thanks. Me too.
-'Kay.

35:40.643 --> 35:43.062
-Go, go. We'll, we'll talk later.
-Okay.

35:43.938 --> 35:44.772
Copy.

35:45.273 --> 35:47.024
The show is gonna be huge!

36:01.581 --> 36:04.584
I wondered what she was doing
downstairs all this time.

36:04.667 --> 36:08.880
Look at this. It has a barrette.
Can you believe?

36:08.963 --> 36:10.965
It's so pretty.

36:13.301 --> 36:14.886
-Bet that's the Neiman's buyer.
-Hi!

36:14.969 --> 36:17.221
I smell a sale.

36:18.347 --> 36:20.558
So happy for Lisette.

36:20.641 --> 36:22.435
These are some gorgeous pieces,

36:22.518 --> 36:25.730
-and this is the worst Bellini ever.
-I'm sorry.

36:29.692 --> 36:32.779
Why is that cater-waiter
picking up the jewelry?

36:33.196 --> 36:35.990
I don't know. Maybe he's moving it?

36:38.075 --> 36:39.702
Into his pocket?

36:40.745 --> 36:43.414
Gimme your necklace. And you. Your ring.

36:43.498 --> 36:46.167
-Seriously? Is this happening?
-This is happening.

36:47.418 --> 36:48.753
What's he doing?

36:48.836 --> 36:50.004
What the fuck is this guy doing?

36:50.087 --> 36:51.923
Hey, this cater-waiter
is stealing my shit!

36:52.006 --> 36:54.342
Security, help! Somebody, do something!

36:54.425 --> 36:56.010
I have COVID!

36:56.093 --> 36:57.804
Security! Someone!

36:57.887 --> 37:00.765
Hey! This guy is stealing my stuff!
Somebody, help me!

37:00.848 --> 37:02.600
Help! Somebody, help!

37:02.683 --> 37:05.102
That's enough. Necklace, now!

37:05.186 --> 37:07.480
No, please. Please.

37:07.563 --> 37:10.983
This is my nameplate necklace.
It means everything to me.

37:11.067 --> 37:12.401
I don't think so, punk.

37:12.485 --> 37:13.653
Fuck.

37:14.403 --> 37:16.447
-You have a gun?
-Security, help me!

37:16.531 --> 37:18.825
Can someone help, please?

37:19.158 --> 37:21.577
Where in the motherfuck were you clowns?
They took--

37:21.661 --> 37:23.996
Look at all my stuff. It's gone!

37:24.080 --> 37:25.665
-Oh, my God.
-Where were you?

37:25.748 --> 37:28.709
Oh, my God. They got almost everything.

37:28.793 --> 37:31.337
Miss, you can't smoke in here.

37:31.921 --> 37:34.549
Yeah? Like I'm the problem?

37:52.024 --> 37:53.943
-Honey?
-Mom.

37:54.861 --> 37:55.987
Sweetie.

37:56.070 --> 37:58.281
Oh, honey.

38:00.992 --> 38:02.160
It's okay.

38:02.827 --> 38:05.830
-Everyone's breaking up.
-We're not.

38:06.747 --> 38:10.293
It's okay.
I'm not goin' anywhere.

38:10.376 --> 38:12.795
It's okay. You're home now.

38:13.171 --> 38:16.048
You're home now.
It's okay.

38:17.800 --> 38:20.386
-Alright, hold up.
-Here ya go.

38:20.470 --> 38:22.889
Come on! How much longer?

38:26.934 --> 38:29.437
Are we even moving?

38:29.520 --> 38:31.898
Garbage truck. Third one today.

38:31.981 --> 38:34.984
I'm just gonna walk home.
It's just around the corner.

38:35.943 --> 38:37.069
This city...

38:44.035 --> 38:46.788
What a cutie. May I pet it?

38:46.871 --> 38:49.123
Hey! Who's a beauty?

38:49.207 --> 38:53.961
You are. Yes, you are, you are.

39:03.054 --> 39:04.680
Oh, my God.

39:07.141 --> 39:08.142
No!

39:20.196 --> 39:22.406
Lisette, it's Carrie.

39:26.119 --> 39:27.328
Lisette?

39:48.516 --> 39:52.353
I know the key was only meant
for emergencies, but this felt like one.

39:54.355 --> 39:57.024
I brought some chocolates
my friend sent me.

39:57.108 --> 40:01.028
I can't eat the whole box alone.
I mean, I could, but...

40:01.446 --> 40:02.321
Yum.

40:03.698 --> 40:05.032
How are you?

40:06.742 --> 40:07.952
It's gone.

40:09.162 --> 40:14.375
Everything I worked so hard to make,
and it was perfect.

40:15.918 --> 40:17.920
I have to start all over again.

40:19.714 --> 40:21.340
I know how you feel.

40:25.178 --> 40:26.304
May I join you?

40:42.570 --> 40:44.781
At some point, we'll have to get up.

40:47.366 --> 40:48.326
But not now.

40:59.003 --> 41:03.299
"And as I held on to John one final time,

41:03.382 --> 41:06.052
"the rising water on the shower floor

41:06.135 --> 41:10.139
turned the blue
of my wedding shoes black."

41:13.309 --> 41:15.770
Okay, that's chapter three. Done.

41:15.853 --> 41:17.146
We got all the pick-ups? Yeah?

41:17.230 --> 41:18.940
-We're good.
-Done, done.

41:19.023 --> 41:21.025
That's all she wrote.

41:21.109 --> 41:22.735
You did it, Carrie.

41:23.152 --> 41:24.362
Yep.

41:25.279 --> 41:26.656
I did it.

41:35.456 --> 41:38.668
A toast.
To the classy, old-fashioned mugger

41:38.751 --> 41:42.755
who just took my wallet
and tossed my purse.

41:42.839 --> 41:47.051
Absolutely. To New York City.

41:47.135 --> 41:49.804
The good and the bad.

41:50.346 --> 41:52.974
And by bad,
do you mean this communal table?

41:54.100 --> 41:56.477
Hey, ladies! Cheers to you.

41:57.520 --> 41:58.521
Cheers!

41:58.604 --> 42:01.399
-Where're you in from?
-I'm New York City, born and bred.

42:02.275 --> 42:03.568
What about you, mate?

42:03.651 --> 42:06.195
Very good.
Yes, we're all from Sydney.

42:06.279 --> 42:07.655
We're here on a rugby trip.

42:07.738 --> 42:09.198
We're having a bloody good time
in New York City.

42:09.282 --> 42:10.533
-Right, boys?
-That's right.

42:10.616 --> 42:12.827
Hey there, "born and bred."
We only have two more days here,

42:12.910 --> 42:16.456
so how 'bout we slide down,
buy you a round, and you can tell us

42:16.539 --> 42:17.832
what we need to see before we leave?

42:17.915 --> 42:20.293
Okay, I'm into New York again.

42:20.376 --> 42:22.170
Let's get this party started over here.

42:27.633 --> 42:29.635
And just like that...

42:30.428 --> 42:32.013
I got COVID.
