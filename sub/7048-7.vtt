WEBVTT

00:10.498 --> 00:12.241
- Winona?
- No!

00:14.335 --> 00:15.449
It's not here.

00:15.878 --> 00:18.795
- What's not?
- The $100 bill. It's not here.

00:22.426 --> 00:24.798
- I didn't move anything.
- It was never here.

00:25.554 --> 00:29.634
- Those are the only $100s...
- The one I had had a corner torn off.

00:29.767 --> 00:31.178
None of these have a corner torn off.

00:31.310 --> 00:33.635
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

00:33.771 --> 00:35.348
I wish I wasn't. But I'm sure.

00:36.857 --> 00:39.099
You didn't say anything
about a torn corner yesterday.

00:39.235 --> 00:42.152
I know. It's 'cause
I just thought of it, just now, Raylan.

00:42.821 --> 00:45.739
I'm sorry. I did such a stupid thing.

00:51.497 --> 00:53.655
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna find it.

00:54.833 --> 00:57.289
- Where could it be?
- I have no idea.

01:04.677 --> 01:06.716
- I'm really sorry.
- I know that.

01:07.054 --> 01:09.723
It's the only reason I'm not beating you
over the head with a phone book.

01:10.891 --> 01:13.180
- You angry?
- What do you think?

01:14.937 --> 01:16.846
I think you're gonna save me.

01:24.321 --> 01:25.650
Stay here. I'll call you.

02:11.619 --> 02:14.192
Turn around. Hands.

02:22.421 --> 02:23.500
That's a Montblanc.

02:26.050 --> 02:27.129
You get it back when you go.

02:32.681 --> 02:33.760
We're good!

02:38.896 --> 02:40.307
Gary Hawkins.

02:40.439 --> 02:41.518
Mr. Duffy.

02:41.899 --> 02:43.441
"Mr. Duffy"? So formal.

02:43.651 --> 02:46.438
All we been through, I thought
we'd be on more familiar terms.

02:47.488 --> 02:50.275
Well, I am glad you agreed to see me,
given our history.

02:50.407 --> 02:52.733
Our history, indeed.
Thanks to you, I took a bullet,

02:52.868 --> 02:55.441
lost seven pints of blood
and 18 inches of intestine.

02:56.705 --> 02:59.825
I had the surgeons keep it for me
as a memento of that day,

02:59.958 --> 03:01.203
preserved in Lucite.

03:01.627 --> 03:02.907
Would you like to see it?

03:05.464 --> 03:07.006
Okay.

03:07.383 --> 03:12.258
Gary, I don't have 18 inches of
intestine preserved in Lucite.

03:14.682 --> 03:16.010
What can I do for you, Gary?

03:16.141 --> 03:18.811
You sounded borderline
incoherent on the telephone.

03:20.646 --> 03:21.808
You wanna talk to me
about a racehorse?

03:22.648 --> 03:24.522
Well, Mr. Duffy...

03:25.526 --> 03:28.230
- Wynn.
- On second thought, Mr. Duffy's fine.

03:30.114 --> 03:31.738
Well, sir,

03:31.990 --> 03:36.985
I find that I have come upon a very
exciting investment opportunity.

04:07.109 --> 04:09.148
Boyd Crowder. Carol Johnson.

04:09.570 --> 04:12.654
Executive vice president of Black Pike
Coal. Thank you so much for coming by.

04:12.781 --> 04:13.812
It is such a pleasure to meet you.

04:15.242 --> 04:17.033
- Likewise, ma'am.
- Carol.

04:17.786 --> 04:22.282
First off, I wanna thank you for doing
what you could to save our money,

04:22.416 --> 04:25.417
our mine, and most of all,
the lives of our miners.

04:25.878 --> 04:28.285
Black Pike understands
that the most valuable commodity

04:28.422 --> 04:29.584
in all our mines is the miners.

04:29.715 --> 04:31.957
This company owes you
a debt of gratitude,

04:32.092 --> 04:34.215
which is why I was mortified
when it was brought to my attention

04:34.344 --> 04:35.755
that you'd been mistakenly let go.

04:36.847 --> 04:39.338
- "Mistakenly"?
- Boyd, I'm gonna cut to the chase.

04:39.475 --> 04:42.392
I'd very much like you to be
a part of the Black Pike security team.

04:44.813 --> 04:46.770
- Well, ma'am...
- Carol.

04:47.191 --> 04:50.026
Miss Johnson, I mean no offence,

04:50.152 --> 04:52.310
and I would be thrilled
to be hired back by your company.

04:52.446 --> 04:56.396
But if it's all the same, I'd just
as soon have a job driving a truck.

04:56.784 --> 05:00.117
No offence taken, but it's not all the same.
I want you to be part of this team.

05:00.537 --> 05:02.993
Well, again, ma'am,
I appreciate the vote of confidence,

05:03.123 --> 05:05.199
but I'm not sure if
you're familiar with...

05:06.251 --> 05:09.703
How should I put this? My background.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.998
Boyd, I know all about your background.

05:12.132 --> 05:14.754
In fact, it's what tells me
you're exactly the man we need.

05:15.177 --> 05:17.549
Now, how about we get started today,
right away?

05:17.805 --> 05:20.260
A little road trip.
You have a suit of any sort?

05:20.766 --> 05:21.928
No, ma'am.

05:22.351 --> 05:24.059
That's all right.
I think there's a Penney's on the way.

05:24.394 --> 05:26.387
There a Penney's on the way?
Yeah. All right.

05:26.522 --> 05:27.850
Shall we? We're on a bit of a clock.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.305
Come on.

05:33.695 --> 05:35.273
You've been a bad boy.

05:35.447 --> 05:37.404
I get that a lot.
You're gonna have to be more specific.

05:38.325 --> 05:39.605
Today is Wednesday.

05:40.369 --> 05:41.448
This is my fault?

05:42.287 --> 05:45.205
- Today's your day to bring coffee.
- Shit.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.374
- Do I still need to...
- I'll get Tim to do it.

05:48.502 --> 05:49.996
- He's on an errand anyway.
- Thank you.

05:50.128 --> 05:51.836
We're assisting the FBI.

05:53.298 --> 05:55.374
- You all right?
- I slept through my alarm.

05:55.509 --> 05:58.082
That always throws me.
How are we assisting the FBI?

05:58.345 --> 06:01.465
Preliminary paperwork and interviews
from yesterday's bank robberies

06:01.598 --> 06:03.472
and collecting evidence from county.

06:04.643 --> 06:05.722
Why us?

06:06.270 --> 06:07.265
Ask Art.

06:11.692 --> 06:13.316
- You suck.
- Coffee?

06:14.111 --> 06:15.142
Yeah, it was your day.

06:15.279 --> 06:17.437
- You heard about that?
- I hear everything.

06:17.573 --> 06:19.150
Since you got those little
things in your ears.

06:20.492 --> 06:22.900
You know what, Raylan?
I plan on living a long time,

06:23.036 --> 06:27.200
and chief among my motivators, along
with seeing my grandchildren grow up,

06:27.332 --> 06:29.704
will be watching you
slide into decrepitude.

06:30.377 --> 06:32.037
Why are we assisting the FBI?

06:32.170 --> 06:34.840
The FBI's busy
with al-Qaeda in Kentucky now.

06:34.965 --> 06:37.373
They don't have as much time
for drugs and thugs any more.

06:37.676 --> 06:40.428
Not because you insisted on taking
the lead in their case yesterday?

06:40.846 --> 06:41.960
Well, that, too.

06:43.724 --> 06:45.800
Hey, that old bank robber...

06:46.518 --> 06:48.677
Why does everything
got to be about age with you?

06:48.812 --> 06:52.513
Did he say anything about them spending
any of the money during the day?

06:54.151 --> 06:55.182
Why?

06:55.319 --> 06:57.774
Because last time
I assisted the FBI on a bank robbery,

06:57.905 --> 07:00.312
I didn't provide a detailed
trail of the money.

07:00.657 --> 07:02.531
Did they make fun of you?
They hurt your feelings?

07:02.701 --> 07:05.737
Yeah, and I don't want that to
happen again, so did you ask him?

07:06.121 --> 07:07.699
He said they didn't
have time to spend it.

07:08.665 --> 07:09.780
Think he was telling the truth?

07:10.292 --> 07:12.664
Well, he's a bank robber, Raylan.
Why would he lie to me?

07:14.212 --> 07:16.086
Raylan, what's the matter?

07:17.925 --> 07:19.668
I could use some coffee.

08:12.437 --> 08:16.305
Yeah, this is Deputy Givens.
I'm working yesterday's bank robbery.

08:17.359 --> 08:22.899
Did you recover any money
from Carter Hayes?

08:24.825 --> 08:26.105
What denominations?

08:27.744 --> 08:30.200
No, no. Don't send it.

08:30.497 --> 08:34.246
I'll pick it up shortly.
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.

08:41.258 --> 08:42.835
Thank you, Steven.
Watch closely, Boyd.

08:44.010 --> 08:46.881
<i>Okay, you rolling? Good.
Geez. You hear that?</i>

08:47.014 --> 08:49.551
<i>Now, first,
they blow the top off the mountain,</i>

08:49.683 --> 08:52.174
<i>and then they hop in their
blasted bulldozers</i>

08:52.311 --> 08:54.683
<i>and push all the rocks that they
don't want off the side,</i>

08:54.896 --> 08:57.138
<i>clogging our creeks and our streams.</i>

08:59.317 --> 09:00.693
<i>That was a big one.</i>

09:01.153 --> 09:04.403
<i>See, they're not all smaller rocks.
Sometimes they're great, big...</i>

09:05.282 --> 09:06.444
<i>Jesus God!</i>

09:12.289 --> 09:13.949
It's pretty crazy, right?

09:15.125 --> 09:17.912
It got 700,000 hits
before they took it down.

09:19.629 --> 09:21.955
But this is a federal case.

09:22.090 --> 09:26.088
Federal civil, on account of the
Interstate Commerce Clause or something.

09:26.219 --> 09:29.256
What do you think of the video?
It's pretty incriminating, isn't it?

09:29.389 --> 09:32.426
Well, this is outside of
my area of expertise,

09:32.559 --> 09:35.228
but I would imagine
your defence would include

09:35.354 --> 09:38.520
some sort of manipulation
of computer imagery.

09:38.815 --> 09:43.145
No, no. They found the boulder and
what was left of Kirby Peener under it.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.357
No disputing that.

09:44.488 --> 09:47.939
The trick is gonna be to get the judge
to disallow his family's lawyers

09:48.075 --> 09:49.901
from showing this video to the jury.

09:50.911 --> 09:53.153
We're already getting death threats.

09:53.288 --> 09:56.455
The agitators are gonna go ape-shit
if we get this exclusion.

09:56.792 --> 10:00.410
So is that why you want me here?
The death threats?

10:01.129 --> 10:02.540
Among other things.

10:07.886 --> 10:08.917
You wanna watch it again?

10:09.221 --> 10:11.972
No. No. No, thank you.

10:16.478 --> 10:17.593
- Hey.
- Yeah?

10:17.729 --> 10:18.844
Is this where I pick up evidence?

10:19.689 --> 10:22.477
- Raylan Givens. I think we spoke earlier.
- We did?

10:22.859 --> 10:25.896
Yeah, evidence taken from Carter
Hayes. I'm here to pick that up.

10:27.614 --> 10:28.645
Yeah.

10:29.282 --> 10:31.322
- Is this where I pick it up?
- Nice.

10:32.577 --> 10:33.858
I'm sorry. What?

10:34.538 --> 10:38.831
Evidence taken from Carter Hayes.
I'm here to pick that up.

10:39.042 --> 10:40.536
- Yeah.
- Great.

10:40.669 --> 10:42.994
- But it's not here.
- I'm sorry?

10:43.130 --> 10:45.621
Another deputy came by
maybe 10 minutes ago, picked it up.

10:45.757 --> 10:46.836
Who?

10:49.427 --> 10:51.420
Gutterson? Gutterson.

11:01.022 --> 11:03.560
- Is that the evidence from the jail?
- It is.

11:03.692 --> 11:05.601
- You want me to run it down to the vault?
- I can do it.

11:06.445 --> 11:07.987
I don't mind. I was going there anyway.

11:09.906 --> 11:11.531
Coffee's on your desk.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.080
Hold that, please! Can you hold that?

11:21.293 --> 11:22.953
Shit. Sorry. Wrong button.

11:41.188 --> 11:43.180
- Hi.
- Where you going with that?

11:47.527 --> 11:48.808
The vault.

11:49.571 --> 11:51.279
You scan the currency first?

11:52.532 --> 11:53.730
No.

11:54.117 --> 11:57.201
The FBI asked us to scan it
and send digital copies

11:57.329 --> 11:59.998
- to the Secret Service and the FRB.
- Shit.

12:01.082 --> 12:02.458
You should get two alarms.

12:04.461 --> 12:06.288
To make sure you wake up.

12:09.257 --> 12:10.336
Right.

12:11.801 --> 12:14.339
- You want me to do it?
- No. I'll do it.

12:15.305 --> 12:16.585
How else will I learn?

12:27.150 --> 12:28.692
Thought you'd taken
that down to the vault.

12:28.818 --> 12:31.356
Yeah, well, apparently they
gotta get scanned first.

12:31.488 --> 12:32.686
I already did that.

12:33.532 --> 12:34.611
You did?

12:34.741 --> 12:37.576
I scanned the bills, sent the files
to the Secret Service and FRB,

12:37.702 --> 12:39.909
just as our dear friends
at the Feeb requested.

12:40.038 --> 12:41.117
Why didn't you tell me that?

12:42.874 --> 12:44.072
Well, I presumed you already knew.

12:44.209 --> 12:46.118
Otherwise, why would you be
taking it down to evidence?

12:48.922 --> 12:51.211
Well, I guess
I'm gonna go get back on the elevator.

12:54.094 --> 12:55.837
- You had it in your hand.
- I did.

12:55.971 --> 12:58.462
- But I had to put it back.
- Why?

12:58.640 --> 13:00.965
Because Tim already sent
a digital scan of the bill

13:01.101 --> 13:02.892
to the Secret Service
and the Federal Reserve.

13:03.019 --> 13:06.222
So, when those guys
come looking for it,

13:07.232 --> 13:08.892
it wouldn't match the
one that he scanned.

13:09.150 --> 13:10.395
Do you think they're gonna look at it?

13:12.195 --> 13:13.440
I don't know. It's a $100 bill

13:13.571 --> 13:15.648
that's part of a huge sum of money
they haven't seen in 20 years.

13:15.782 --> 13:17.905
So, yeah, I do.
I think they'll come look at it.

13:22.747 --> 13:23.910
Hey.

13:27.335 --> 13:28.746
It's not that big a deal.

13:28.878 --> 13:31.120
No, it ain't. It's one bill.

13:33.008 --> 13:34.418
Maybe you get a fine.

13:34.551 --> 13:36.342
It's not like you're gonna do time
for something like that.

13:36.469 --> 13:37.549
No.

13:38.722 --> 13:41.213
- It's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not gonna be okay.

13:52.736 --> 13:54.313
You took all the money?

13:59.367 --> 14:00.482
I don't know why.

14:01.077 --> 14:03.912
I mean, I could say it was 'cause
of Gary and all that bullshit,

14:04.039 --> 14:07.123
I was gonna use it to get clear of him,
or that I was gonna use it for me and you.

14:07.250 --> 14:10.002
But, honestly, the thought that kept
going through my head over and over

14:10.128 --> 14:12.370
was, "Just take it and
worry about why later."

14:12.505 --> 14:14.961
So, I go to take the money
and put it in my purse.

14:15.091 --> 14:18.294
And then I realise my purse
is too small. So, gym bag.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.380
So, I start stuffing it in my gym bag,

14:20.513 --> 14:23.550
and I drop the keys onto Weaver's
desk, and I get in my car,

14:23.683 --> 14:25.676
on my way here, because I thought
I would put it under the bed

14:25.810 --> 14:27.969
because I think this is a really
safe place for it.

14:28.104 --> 14:31.769
So, I'm in the car, and I think,
"Hold on. What if it's counterfeit?

14:32.233 --> 14:34.903
"What if that's why
everybody's forgotten about it?"

14:35.028 --> 14:37.104
So, I think, "Okay,
I'm gonna take one bill to the bank,

14:37.238 --> 14:40.026
"and they're gonna let me know
whether or not it's real."

14:40.158 --> 14:42.151
So, I'm in the bank, and
I'm waiting in line.

14:42.285 --> 14:45.239
And the teller yells, "Next!"

14:45.372 --> 14:47.613
And I'm all, "Next for what?"

14:47.749 --> 14:50.952
And then I'm like,
"Oh, my God. What am I doing?"

14:52.629 --> 14:54.372
I go to the front door
'cause I'm gonna take this back

14:54.506 --> 14:56.249
and I'm gonna put it
right where I found it

14:56.383 --> 14:59.218
and this is gonna be a really funny
story that I tell you, maybe, someday.

14:59.344 --> 15:01.965
And the next thing I know
is some guy's got a gun in my face

15:02.097 --> 15:03.211
and he's telling everybody,
"Get on the floor."

15:10.522 --> 15:11.684
Say something.

15:12.565 --> 15:13.597
Wow.

15:13.733 --> 15:14.896
Say something else.

15:16.736 --> 15:18.812
Why didn't you tell me
about this yesterday?

15:19.364 --> 15:21.522
Because I didn't want...

15:21.658 --> 15:25.608
I didn't want you to think I was someone who
was capable of doing something like this.

15:25.745 --> 15:28.746
Everyone's capable
of doing something this, Winona.

15:29.624 --> 15:33.752
Now, I come across huge sums of money,
usually belonging to bad people.

15:33.878 --> 15:35.456
I think, "No one will miss it."

15:36.047 --> 15:37.245
Did you ever take it?

15:38.174 --> 15:39.253
- No.
- I did.

15:41.094 --> 15:42.718
God, Jesus. What am I gonna do?

15:43.012 --> 15:45.930
Well, first thing we're gonna do is put
it back in the vault and hope no one...

15:46.057 --> 15:49.473
"We"? No, Raylan, I'm not gonna
get you further involved in this.

15:50.728 --> 15:51.891
You wanna do this on your own?

15:52.605 --> 15:54.349
- Yeah.
- How you gonna get past security?

15:55.900 --> 15:58.570
I'll... I'll just put it in
with some court documents.

15:58.695 --> 15:59.809
It's gonna look like paper on the X-ray.

15:59.946 --> 16:01.773
That flyrock case you're on,
they've doubled security.

16:01.906 --> 16:03.780
- They're hand-checking every bag.
- Shit.

16:08.413 --> 16:09.872
We'll take it through
the marshals' entrance.

16:09.998 --> 16:12.785
- They don't have cameras back there?
- They do.

16:13.668 --> 16:18.295
So, if this whole thing goes to hell,
people are gonna know you're involved.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.211
That's right.

16:22.343 --> 16:25.428
So, let's make sure it don't go to hell.

16:29.184 --> 16:32.434
Clean coal, dirty lie!
Clean coal, dirty lie!

16:33.354 --> 16:35.680
Clean coal, dirty lie! Clean coal...

16:37.066 --> 16:38.146
Bags, please, ma'am.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.029
Hold on. Put your arms out.

16:49.245 --> 16:50.324
- Turn around.
- Jimbo?

16:51.122 --> 16:52.451
- Who's the new guy?
- Wolf.

16:52.832 --> 16:56.082
He was in the Marshals in Louisville.
Company sent him in to help out.

16:56.544 --> 16:58.916
Well, Mr. Wolf, if any of these badasses
give you a hard time,

16:59.047 --> 17:00.541
just take away their
bladder medication.

17:01.674 --> 17:02.754
I used to like you.

17:02.884 --> 17:04.960
As long as they do what I say,
we got no problem.

17:05.220 --> 17:07.508
Wolf still thinks the western district's
the place to be.

17:07.638 --> 17:08.670
Where's the Derby held at?

17:08.806 --> 17:11.095
Is it in Lexington?
No, that's right. It's in Louisville.

17:11.226 --> 17:13.301
Where's UK? Is that in Louisville?
No, it's right here.

17:13.478 --> 17:15.137
You got colour TV here
yet in Lexington?

17:15.521 --> 17:17.810
Oh, that's next on the list,
right after indoor plumbing.

17:18.023 --> 17:20.017
- I believe it.
- Travelling light today, Miss Hawkins.

17:20.484 --> 17:22.276
- What?
- Where's the other bag?

17:22.487 --> 17:23.862
I left it here overnight.

17:24.405 --> 17:28.106
- I could swear I saw you take it last...
- Well, don't swear an oath, 'cause I didn't.

17:29.369 --> 17:31.242
- Good morning, Raylan.
- Winona.

17:46.386 --> 17:48.213
- Miss Hawkins!
- Good morning, Judge.

17:48.346 --> 17:50.006
Good? It blows dead donkey dick.

17:50.139 --> 17:53.259
Look, with all the crazies outside,
I need to get this ruling done by lunch,

17:53.393 --> 17:56.643
and I want to put the fear of God
into counsel before I do. Let's go.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.598
- Okay, I just need to put my bag in my office.
- No time.

17:58.731 --> 17:59.976
It'll only take one minute.

18:00.441 --> 18:03.478
What's so important in there you have
to put it in your office right now?

18:04.237 --> 18:06.146
- Gym clothes.
- Shit.

18:06.614 --> 18:10.659
I know 50 men in this building that would
pay good money to sniff your gym clothes.

18:11.452 --> 18:13.575
Well, I will keep that in mind
if I'm ever short on cash.

18:13.705 --> 18:15.697
You can take it upstairs later. Let's go.

18:43.860 --> 18:45.105
Well, there you are.

18:45.820 --> 18:46.935
Yes, here I am.

18:47.071 --> 18:49.230
Judge Reardon wants to see you
in chambers.

18:50.491 --> 18:51.571
Me? Why?

18:51.701 --> 18:54.821
I'll bet that comes up in conversation
when you see him in chambers.

18:57.081 --> 19:00.367
- It's inflammatory and meaningless!
- It's the truth, captured on DVD.

19:00.501 --> 19:02.874
- Illegally obtained!
- They thought they were on state land.

19:03.004 --> 19:05.625
Quiet! We didn't come here
to debate the damn thing.

19:05.757 --> 19:08.045
I heard you both on this
ad freaking nauseam. Just...

19:09.552 --> 19:12.968
We're here to lay out the ground rules
of behaviour in my courtroom.

19:13.097 --> 19:16.929
And I'm warning you,
anyone, either side, gets out of line,

19:17.060 --> 19:20.179
I will clamp down on you
like a bear trap on a chicken leg.

19:20.313 --> 19:21.558
- Judge?
- What?

19:22.690 --> 19:26.355
- Well, looky here who it is, Raylan Givens.
- Your Honour?

19:26.986 --> 19:30.189
Everybody, this is Deputy US Marshal
Raylan Givens,

19:30.323 --> 19:34.819
saved my sorry ass not so long ago
from a man intent on killing me.

19:35.662 --> 19:38.199
These two are the counsel
on the flyrock case.

19:38.998 --> 19:41.323
I know you know this fine young lady.

19:41.793 --> 19:45.043
Deputy Givens and Ms. Hawkins here
were married in a previous life.

19:46.714 --> 19:47.912
How'd you ever let her get away?

19:49.384 --> 19:50.878
- We all make mistakes.
- Yeah.

19:51.594 --> 19:53.338
- You asked for me?
- Yeah.

19:55.098 --> 19:58.182
Court-security honcho
said his team checked my courtroom,

19:58.851 --> 20:00.180
but his team's a bunch of geezers.

20:01.020 --> 20:02.265
They're all retired Marshals.

20:02.397 --> 20:04.354
And they're all well
past their sell-by date.

20:04.482 --> 20:06.225
I'd appreciate it if you'd
give it a look-see.

20:07.151 --> 20:10.520
No. Now, tensions are
running high here, Deputy,

20:11.155 --> 20:12.899
and I wanna know if I
bring my gavel down

20:13.032 --> 20:15.702
I don't set off
some kind of incendiary device,

20:16.035 --> 20:18.407
hurry us all along to our maker.

20:19.455 --> 20:20.487
You do that for me?

20:21.040 --> 20:23.116
- I'll do it right now.
- I appreciate it.

20:24.419 --> 20:27.289
So, you're telling me

20:27.797 --> 20:30.466
that you found yourself
someone better than that?

20:37.098 --> 20:38.261
Boyd?

20:39.142 --> 20:40.600
Hello, Raylan.

20:40.852 --> 20:42.346
What are you doing here?

20:42.478 --> 20:45.313
They were gonna put us on a bench
out there in the hallway,

20:45.440 --> 20:47.017
but then the plaintiff's
family's there, too.

20:47.150 --> 20:49.391
So everyone thought
we'd be better off in here.

20:49.569 --> 20:50.683
I hope we're not in your way.

20:50.903 --> 20:52.481
Raylan, this is Miss Carol Johnson.

20:52.613 --> 20:55.318
She works for Black Pike,
the defendant in the federal civil case

20:55.450 --> 20:56.612
before the court this morning.

20:56.743 --> 20:59.743
Miss Johnson, this is Deputy
US Marshal Raylan Givens.

21:00.455 --> 21:02.246
- It's a pleasure.
- Likewise.

21:03.124 --> 21:04.452
Forgive me if I was rude.

21:04.584 --> 21:08.498
I've been asked to make sure
the courthouse is secure.

21:08.629 --> 21:11.299
So, again, Boyd,
what are you doing here?

21:11.841 --> 21:13.465
Boyd is part of my security team.

21:13.593 --> 21:14.707
Security?

21:17.638 --> 21:18.967
I like the suit.

21:24.896 --> 21:29.771
You're aware that Marshal Service provides
courthouse security in any federal case?

21:30.777 --> 21:33.102
I like having one of my own
to watch my back.

22:01.808 --> 22:02.922
Raylan?

22:04.393 --> 22:05.556
Raylan.

22:08.397 --> 22:10.935
I would never presume
to tell you how to do your job,

22:11.067 --> 22:13.439
and I understand that I am
very new to this security game.

22:13.569 --> 22:17.863
However, I have spent a considerable
amount of time hiding explosives.

22:17.990 --> 22:21.940
Now, if you would like, I'd be more than
happy to walk around here with you,

22:22.078 --> 22:24.070
show you where I would hide mine

22:24.497 --> 22:27.166
in case there might be a place
that you might miss.

22:28.334 --> 22:30.161
You have any explosives on you now?

22:30.294 --> 22:31.670
Do you want to pat me down?

22:33.840 --> 22:35.500
No, I'm sure you're fine.

22:35.883 --> 22:37.840
So, you two knew each
other growing up?

22:38.177 --> 22:41.214
Until the age of 19, when Raylan
went off to college and the Marshals

22:41.848 --> 22:43.390
and I went off to Kuwait.

22:43.516 --> 22:45.307
And when did you guys meet up again?

22:46.352 --> 22:48.925
Wasn't it around the time
that he shot you through the chest?

22:49.230 --> 22:51.436
Well, it was shortly before that.

22:52.567 --> 22:56.399
Miss Johnson has recently become
acquainted with some of my past, Raylan.

22:57.405 --> 22:59.444
So, Deputy, what do you think?

23:00.533 --> 23:02.241
Can I trust Boyd here to have my back?

23:04.996 --> 23:09.076
Well, I am an officer of the law,
and I'm in a court of law,

23:09.208 --> 23:10.406
and while not sworn in,

23:11.377 --> 23:13.833
I do feel compelled
to tell you the truth.

23:13.963 --> 23:15.208
Truth is the best policy.

23:15.339 --> 23:16.419
The truth is

23:17.758 --> 23:21.542
I don't know if you can trust Boyd
to have your back,

23:23.097 --> 23:27.640
but, while he has tried to kill me and
I have shot him and imprisoned him

23:27.977 --> 23:31.346
and I wouldn't be surprised if our
paths, again, cross in such a manner,

23:32.356 --> 23:34.349
he has had my back on two occasions.

23:36.694 --> 23:39.814
Once was the last day I was in the
mine, and the other not so long ago.

23:41.198 --> 23:44.199
My, sounds like a love story.

23:49.498 --> 23:50.993
- Be ready to go in 10.
- Judge.

23:51.918 --> 23:53.412
Sweetheart, you're welcome to stay.

23:54.211 --> 23:55.754
Oh, thanks. That's sweet, Judge,

23:55.880 --> 23:59.083
but I'd really rather get my
by-now-rancid clothes back to my office.

23:59.216 --> 24:01.708
You're not afraid I'm gonna change in
front of you, are you?

24:01.844 --> 24:03.469
Well, now, that's the only reason
I would stay.

24:12.813 --> 24:13.928
Charlie?

24:17.568 --> 24:18.599
Charlie!

24:27.662 --> 24:29.204
- Deputy.
- Miss Hawkins.

24:29.330 --> 24:30.789
- We all clear?
- We are.

24:31.248 --> 24:32.363
Well, you should let the judge know.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.492
You know how he likes
to be kept waiting, so...

24:34.627 --> 24:35.706
Yes.

24:38.089 --> 24:39.120
Pleasure.

24:39.256 --> 24:41.083
So nice to have met you, Deputy.

24:41.217 --> 24:43.375
Boyd, I do like the suit.

24:46.430 --> 24:48.553
What's going on? Just...

24:49.100 --> 24:50.298
What are you doing?

24:50.434 --> 24:52.391
Well, Reardon came down
and he needed me in chambers...

24:52.520 --> 24:54.144
- Raylan! Is it clear?
- Be quiet. I'm sorry?

24:54.272 --> 24:55.386
Courtroom? We good?

24:56.148 --> 24:58.639
- Crystal clear, Your Honour.
- Thank you. Winona, I need you inside.

24:58.776 --> 25:01.184
- I just gotta get my bag back...
- You already had time to do that.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.399
I got distracted.

25:02.530 --> 25:04.072
I can see your tall drink of distraction
right here.

25:04.198 --> 25:06.321
Jill, take Miss Hawkins' bag,
put it up in her office.

25:06.450 --> 25:07.482
- Okay.
- No. I got it.

25:07.618 --> 25:08.649
Jill, take the bag.

25:08.786 --> 25:10.280
You're on the third floor?

25:10.413 --> 25:12.820
I'm actually going up there now.
I can take it.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.365
- Raylan, Art needs you.
- Just a few minutes.

25:15.501 --> 25:17.209
Now. Secret Service is here.

25:17.336 --> 25:19.625
Secret Service?
Is the president coming?

25:19.755 --> 25:21.831
They also handle money. He said "now."

25:23.092 --> 25:25.250
Deputy, I don't mind bringing it up.
I'll use the stairs.

25:25.386 --> 25:27.425
- It'll be my exercise for today.
- Come on, Winona.

25:29.598 --> 25:31.141
- Raylan?
- Yeah.

25:35.938 --> 25:37.136
Secret Service?

25:37.273 --> 25:39.764
One of the bills
from yesterday's bank robbery popped.

25:44.363 --> 25:46.735
Raylan.
Rachel tell you what happened?

25:46.866 --> 25:49.321
- Bill popped.
- Yeah, one of the $100s we found on Carter.

25:49.452 --> 25:53.366
Our friends from the Secret Service in
Cincinnati would like a word with you.

25:58.586 --> 25:59.831
It could have come from
one of the drawers.

25:59.962 --> 26:01.504
From one of the people on the floor.

26:01.630 --> 26:02.662
Here you go.

26:03.090 --> 26:05.415
And this is Deputy Raylan Givens.

26:06.302 --> 26:07.713
You interview most of these people?

26:07.845 --> 26:09.090
All of them.

26:09.221 --> 26:10.336
Including your ex-wife?

26:10.973 --> 26:11.969
Yeah.

26:12.099 --> 26:14.258
Any of them mention
losing a $100 bill to the robbers?

26:15.936 --> 26:17.395
Not that I recall.

26:17.688 --> 26:19.811
This resolution sucks.

26:20.066 --> 26:22.272
- Here you go.
- Finally.

26:22.902 --> 26:24.978
I'm still not clear on
why this bill popped.

26:25.488 --> 26:27.397
Well, it's been out of
circulation for 20 years.

26:27.656 --> 26:29.815
They think they might be trying
to counterfeit the older ones

26:29.950 --> 26:31.658
'cause they're easier to fake
and easier to pass.

26:32.161 --> 26:35.364
Most of the older bills were taken out
of circulation precisely for that reason.

26:35.498 --> 26:37.786
So when this old number popped,
we got in the car.

26:38.876 --> 26:39.955
Looks like

26:40.544 --> 26:42.003
an American $100 bill.

26:42.338 --> 26:43.666
- It's real.
- You sure?

26:44.048 --> 26:45.079
No, I'm guessing.

26:45.591 --> 26:47.667
I wonder why we haven't
seen it for 20 years.

26:47.843 --> 26:50.215
I wonder why you give a shit
when it's no longer our responsibility.

26:50.513 --> 26:52.838
Well, thank you for your assistance.

26:53.557 --> 26:55.883
- Coffee sucks, by the way.
- Have a nice day.

27:02.316 --> 27:04.985
Maybe it was in a safe deposit
and somebody just got it out.

27:05.361 --> 27:07.899
Or in a sock drawer or birthday card.

27:08.030 --> 27:10.521
None of the above.
It was in a bank robbery.

27:10.866 --> 27:12.859
- We know that.
- 20 years ago.

27:13.285 --> 27:15.693
I just spoke with a
friend at the FBI in DC.

27:15.996 --> 27:17.906
He ran the serial number
through their database.

27:18.207 --> 27:24.126
That bill was in a robbery of $211,000
from a Lexington savings and loan in 1989.

27:24.630 --> 27:27.002
- Was the money ever recovered?
- It was, all of it.

27:27.508 --> 27:29.833
The trial was in this building in 1990.

27:30.386 --> 27:31.761
So the money was in our vault.

27:31.971 --> 27:34.010
- At one time.
- Maybe it's still there.

27:35.141 --> 27:39.304
Well, wouldn't the fact that a bill was
in circulation imply that it's not there?

27:40.479 --> 27:41.642
Well, I don't know.

27:41.939 --> 27:43.350
- You have a case number?
- I'll get it.

27:43.482 --> 27:45.890
- You know what the name of the bank was?
- Bluegrass Savings and Loan.

27:46.026 --> 27:47.307
Let's go!

27:52.449 --> 27:54.407
- What do you say, Charlie?
- Hey, Art.

27:55.744 --> 27:57.025
- Tim.
- How you doing, Charlie?

27:57.830 --> 27:59.028
Rachel.

28:00.207 --> 28:01.452
Raylan.

28:01.876 --> 28:03.584
I thought you might
need some company.

28:05.379 --> 28:06.458
What's going on?

28:07.214 --> 28:09.705
We're looking for some evidence
from 20 years ago.

28:09.842 --> 28:12.796
20 years ago? All right, well,
we go to the ledgers for that.

28:12.928 --> 28:15.170
- What's the date?
- May 1990.

28:15.973 --> 28:20.137
Now, I know tempers have been running
high, but I'm telling you right now,

28:20.269 --> 28:23.436
I will tolerate no
nonsense in my courtroom.

28:23.564 --> 28:27.431
I have court security standing by
to haul off anyone who gets stupid.

28:27.985 --> 28:31.899
And if the guards don't
take care of it, I will.

28:34.533 --> 28:37.107
All righty, I got three entries,
May 1990.

28:37.244 --> 28:38.275
It's not there.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.037
According to this, the judge in the case

28:40.164 --> 28:42.655
ordered the money
back to the bank after trial.

28:42.791 --> 28:43.906
Did you call the bank?

28:44.043 --> 28:49.333
Bluegrass Savings and Loan went under
in 1992, part of the S&L crisis.

28:49.632 --> 28:51.375
And, again,
as my friend at the FBI says,

28:51.509 --> 28:54.712
none of the serial numbers from the
stolen bills have been seen for 20 years.

28:54.845 --> 28:56.043
Just disappeared?

28:56.180 --> 28:57.639
Well, maybe someone at the bank
socked it away.

28:58.390 --> 29:01.142
- Maybe it was never sent.
- The judge gave the order.

29:01.352 --> 29:03.178
They give the order all the time.

29:03.312 --> 29:05.470
That doesn't mean it happens.
It just falls through the cracks.

29:05.606 --> 29:08.275
I got a great, big box of counterfeit
Beanie Babies over here,

29:08.400 --> 29:10.310
been ordered out of here.
It's still sitting here.

29:12.071 --> 29:13.269
You could call the judge.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.568
It was Judge Reynolds.

29:19.411 --> 29:20.692
He died three years ago.

29:22.039 --> 29:23.237
What was the case number?

29:24.333 --> 29:26.491
While we're down here,
we might as well make sure.

29:26.961 --> 29:31.338
1990053419.

29:31.465 --> 29:33.541
242, one of the old ones in the back.

29:33.676 --> 29:35.004
Well, let's open it up.

29:36.762 --> 29:38.968
- Let's get it.
- 242.

29:41.267 --> 29:43.224
Round of drinks says it's empty.

29:44.103 --> 29:46.261
Sure. I'll take that bet.

29:49.066 --> 29:51.355
$210,000 in forgotten money.

29:51.485 --> 29:54.819
We should run off to Mexico,
start a cult. What are we doing here?

29:55.322 --> 29:59.154
I feel like Geraldo Rivera right before
they opened Al Capone's vault.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.451
Don't tell me you're too young
to know who that is.

30:06.959 --> 30:09.960
Now I really feel like Geraldo
in front of Al Capone's vault.

30:11.380 --> 30:13.752
Rachel, I guess you should call
your friends at the Feeb

30:13.882 --> 30:15.590
and see if they want to pursue this
any further.

30:15.718 --> 30:16.880
Will do.

30:18.345 --> 30:20.753
- Should I lock it up?
- Yeah, we're done, Charlie.

30:20.889 --> 30:22.218
All right.

30:23.350 --> 30:24.892
Pay up, sucker.

30:27.396 --> 30:28.511
I'm gonna disallow it.

30:28.772 --> 30:31.180
- No.
- First warning, Mr. Peener.

30:31.775 --> 30:36.022
I know the video may be accurate,
but it brings no new information.

30:36.155 --> 30:39.109
The fact of death is not in dispute.

30:39.241 --> 30:41.364
- The video's inflammatory.
- It's telling the truth!

30:41.493 --> 30:43.866
Second warning, Mr. Peener.
There is no third.

30:43.996 --> 30:45.075
Junior, listen to the man.

30:45.205 --> 30:46.320
- Mama, he's just...
- Shut it!

30:46.457 --> 30:48.496
May I continue, please?

30:48.709 --> 30:49.824
Sorry, Your Honour.

30:49.960 --> 30:54.040
And it was taken while in the course
of trespassing on private land.

30:54.506 --> 30:56.546
It was night time! We didn't know.

30:56.675 --> 30:57.873
That's it. Get him out of here.

30:58.010 --> 30:59.587
Junior, what did I tell you?

30:59.720 --> 31:01.759
You're gonna put him in jail
for telling the truth?

31:01.889 --> 31:04.261
No, no charge this time.
But I'm telling you what,

31:04.391 --> 31:07.143
I will hold you all in contempt
if it happens at trial.

31:07.269 --> 31:09.392
Now, you best go with your boy
and you take your daughter.

31:09.521 --> 31:11.395
- This ain't right.
- Counsel, advise your clients.

31:11.523 --> 31:13.231
How'd you like it
if a rock crushed your daddy?

31:13.359 --> 31:15.150
- Stop it.
- I videotaped my own daddy dying.

31:15.277 --> 31:17.566
- Stop it.
- You got any idea what that's like?

31:17.821 --> 31:21.107
Hey! If I were you,
I'd sit tight for a few minutes.

31:21.241 --> 31:22.784
Wait till it dies down outside

31:22.910 --> 31:26.658
and let the nut-jobs start heading back
to their caves and tree houses.

31:26.789 --> 31:28.164
Jury selection starts Monday.

31:36.673 --> 31:37.705
Winona.

31:37.841 --> 31:39.917
- Am I still out of jail?
- Yeah, so far.

31:40.052 --> 31:41.427
What was that stuff about
the Secret Service?

31:41.553 --> 31:43.842
It's all right. Go get your bag
and meet me downstairs.

31:43.972 --> 31:45.253
Okay.

31:46.642 --> 31:48.634
- We gotta evacuate.
- Jimbo, what is it?

31:48.769 --> 31:50.429
Bomb threat. Where's the judge?

31:50.562 --> 31:52.721
God damn it!
Jimbo, you know there's never a bomb.

31:52.856 --> 31:54.232
Until there is, Your Honour.

31:54.358 --> 31:57.312
- This bomb threat's probably bullshit.
- Caller was specific.

31:57.444 --> 31:59.271
If we have time to evacuate, we do.

31:59.405 --> 32:01.611
I hate this. I hate this shit.
Come on, everybody. Let's go.

32:01.865 --> 32:03.775
Winona, come on.
Raylan, <i>ándale.</i> Let's go.

32:04.827 --> 32:06.618
I'm just gonna make sure
my office is evac'd.

32:06.745 --> 32:07.943
They're grownups, Raylan. Come on.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.156
I've grown fond of some of them.
I'll be right there.

32:25.013 --> 32:26.840
Turn your cell phones off.
Turn them off right now.

32:26.974 --> 32:29.262
Hold up. Jimbo, hold up.

32:29.435 --> 32:30.680
Everybody's gotta go, Raylan.

32:30.811 --> 32:33.728
Not the judge, not Ms. Johnson
or anyone involved in this case.

32:33.856 --> 32:34.970
What are you talking about?

32:35.107 --> 32:36.482
On this side of security,
no one's got a weapon.

32:36.608 --> 32:37.853
On the other side, it's a different story.

32:38.026 --> 32:39.307
- Who took the call?
- I did.

32:39.611 --> 32:41.521
- Caller ID?
- Just a number, no name.

32:42.448 --> 32:45.069
- All right, did you see the plaintiffs exit?
- I did.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.572
How long after that
did this call come in?

32:57.546 --> 32:58.744
All right, let's roll.

33:14.021 --> 33:16.891
Search every room.
Pike, Bishop, second floor.

33:17.024 --> 33:18.186
Yes, sir.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.157
Anything that isn't nailed
down, you check it.

33:28.285 --> 33:29.400
Yes, sir.

34:08.449 --> 34:10.692
Get out of the car. Step out of the car.

34:11.036 --> 34:12.696
Let me see your hands. Turn around.

34:15.998 --> 34:19.248
I didn't make no bomb threat.
Hell, I don't even have a cell phone.

34:19.378 --> 34:20.409
Me neither.

34:20.545 --> 34:22.088
We didn't say nothing
about no bomb threat.

34:26.051 --> 34:27.214
Keep it clear!

35:07.050 --> 35:08.331
Nothing metallic.

35:09.886 --> 35:12.674
No wires. No blocks.

35:12.931 --> 35:16.347
Looks like stacks of paper.

35:18.729 --> 35:20.187
Go manual.

35:27.112 --> 35:28.108
Clear.

35:33.410 --> 35:34.988
<i>- All clear.</i>
- Stand down.

35:35.621 --> 35:36.996
Stand down. There is no device.

35:37.664 --> 35:40.120
- Stand down?
<i>- The bomb call was from a sniper.</i>

35:40.334 --> 35:41.532
<i>The building is secure.</i>

36:04.107 --> 36:06.729
- Aren't you the hero.
- I'm sorry?

36:07.277 --> 36:09.186
I understand I owe you my life.

36:09.821 --> 36:12.063
- If you were the target.
- Wasn't I?

36:12.949 --> 36:15.785
- Usually it's the judge they're after.
- Really?

36:17.037 --> 36:19.742
Then again, I could be wrong.
Don't let your guard down.

36:19.873 --> 36:22.827
The man belonging to that rifle
is still out there.

36:23.210 --> 36:24.834
I'm surprised to see you here.

36:25.045 --> 36:28.461
Without shackles or an attorney present?
It's a little strange for me, too.

36:28.590 --> 36:32.374
Your boss, he thought it prudent to
bring Ms. Johnson here for safekeeping.

36:32.552 --> 36:33.881
I don't see him.

36:34.471 --> 36:38.089
He said he was gonna go out
and get us some good coffee.

36:48.110 --> 36:49.224
Top left.

36:54.074 --> 36:55.153
Red tape.

36:58.286 --> 37:00.445
Put it back anywhere
except for where you found it.

37:28.316 --> 37:30.605
I think I owe you an apology.

37:33.071 --> 37:36.357
It seems that I woefully neglected
that which you asked me to do.

37:36.491 --> 37:37.950
In what way?

37:38.243 --> 37:41.529
Well, in my haste, I wanted to get you
outside of the courthouse,

37:41.663 --> 37:43.205
which could have led to your death.

37:44.791 --> 37:48.456
Boyd, my security needs go beyond
having a bodyguard.

37:49.296 --> 37:52.250
From the outset, I have had
other things in mind for you to do,

37:52.382 --> 37:55.300
things for which I believe
you are uniquely qualified.

37:55.427 --> 38:00.255
Well, that sounds an awful lot like you
want me to return to my outlaw ways.

38:01.183 --> 38:02.593
How well do you know
the Bennett clan?

38:02.976 --> 38:05.811
Well, everyone in Harlan County
knows Mags Bennett and her boys.

38:05.937 --> 38:06.969
Good.

38:07.689 --> 38:09.349
Mags is getting in the way of my plans,

38:09.483 --> 38:11.559
and she and her boys
are gonna have to be dealt with.

38:22.954 --> 38:24.034
Shit.

38:42.432 --> 38:43.595
Art.

38:46.144 --> 38:47.342
Raylan.

38:52.859 --> 38:54.651
- Charlie here?
- No.

38:58.448 --> 39:00.524
Winona's putting something
in the evidence room.

39:06.122 --> 39:07.498
- Art.
- Winona.

39:10.710 --> 39:12.169
You want me to lock it up?

39:14.005 --> 39:15.832
No. I'll wait for Charlie.
