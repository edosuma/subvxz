WEBVTT

04:24.097 --> 04:27.768
May her soul rest in peace.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.427
May we have a donation,
to assist the family?

07:03.131 --> 07:04.383
You were called
by the Ancestors?

14:23.405 --> 14:25.073
You pay extra?

14:35.292 --> 14:36.793
I have three children.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.134
Too old.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.222
Everywhere I go...

17:53.740 --> 17:55.492
I searched you on the Google.

17:55.534 --> 17:57.119
There is something
we need to fix.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.165
I had a vision about you.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.964
If it wasn't important,
I wouldn't have come.

18:09.006 --> 18:10.090
It was a warning.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.438
It was part-time.

19:22.246 --> 19:23.372
Why not?

29:46.954 --> 29:48.288
It's Junior.

29:49.790 --> 29:50.916
Who?

29:50.958 --> 29:53.126
Junior.

29:53.168 --> 29:55.671
Not interested. Thank you.

29:55.712 --> 29:59.132
I'm here to do the garden!
Who's this?

29:59.174 --> 30:00.342
Hold on.

30:24.741 --> 30:26.994
Okay, dude. Come in.

34:28.860 --> 34:31.196
Katlego. Please don't hang up.

34:32.155 --> 34:36.284
You can't ignore the Ancestors.
Your gift is too strong.

34:36.326 --> 34:37.870
You must answer their call!

34:42.456 --> 34:43.125
I'm begging you.

34:43.166 --> 34:44.668
Listen, my child.

34:49.965 --> 34:50.716
Away from you.

34:50.757 --> 34:52.134
Listen, my child!

34:58.557 --> 35:00.184
You don't listen.
It's still with you!

35:00.225 --> 35:00.851
Answer the Amadlozi.

35:06.982 --> 35:08.567
They're sending you a warn-

35:27.920 --> 35:30.422
Damn!

35:30.464 --> 35:34.009
That blouse looks good on you,
it really does.

35:35.344 --> 35:36.637
Get out of here.
You scared me.

35:37.846 --> 35:39.014
My bad.

35:39.056 --> 35:44.853
I've worked for Kat and Tumi
for a while, and they trust me.

35:44.895 --> 35:47.272
Why don't you get out of here,
you're annoying me.

35:47.314 --> 35:48.982
Don't be like that.

35:49.024 --> 35:52.027
Thought you might be hungry.

36:06.124 --> 36:10.629
I always liked your mom, Martha.

36:10.671 --> 36:14.258
She made a great cup of tea!

36:17.094 --> 36:18.720
So...

36:19.137 --> 36:23.600
What were you doing before this?

36:23.642 --> 36:25.686
I was a waitress.

36:27.771 --> 36:32.901
And... tell me young lady
what made you want to work here?

36:36.989 --> 36:38.907
I want to help Katlego.

36:42.119 --> 36:43.620
And you?
Why are you working here?

36:44.079 --> 36:45.789
For the money.

36:46.498 --> 36:48.667
-Money?
-Yes, money.

36:49.293 --> 36:50.544
Is that it?

36:51.253 --> 36:53.088
-Come on...
-Want me to help?

36:54.256 --> 36:55.549
How?

36:55.591 --> 36:56.508
You want money?

36:56.550 --> 36:57.593
Who doesn't want money?

36:57.634 --> 36:59.720
Come. Open your mouth.

36:59.761 --> 37:00.846
You messing with me?

37:00.888 --> 37:02.181
Come closer.

37:03.098 --> 37:06.143
Come closer. Mm-hmm.

37:07.895 --> 37:09.062
-Now say 'ah'.
-Ah.

37:09.104 --> 37:12.733
Open wide.
Stay like that.

37:16.612 --> 37:18.030
Don't move. Stay like that.

38:04.409 --> 38:05.744
Yoh!

38:08.288 --> 38:09.831
You want the money
to appear at once?

38:09.873 --> 38:12.835
You have to be patient.
It will come.

38:12.876 --> 38:15.295
And when it comes,

38:15.337 --> 38:18.924
please buy me a car?
Will you?

38:21.802 --> 38:22.970
Jeez.

52:44.581 --> 52:46.333
Hey, let me tell you,
it was crazy,

52:46.375 --> 52:48.377
we were playing
and spinning dice there

52:48.418 --> 52:52.339
and I landed every roll!

52:52.381 --> 52:54.591
Cleaned everyone out!

52:54.633 --> 52:56.927
The guys thought I was cheating!

53:00.931 --> 53:04.810
And I told them
you guys don't now

53:04.852 --> 53:06.979
this young lady Blessing!

53:09.022 --> 53:11.400
Let me just tell you
how this thing works.

53:11.441 --> 53:13.694
In the world there are energies
and forces at work

53:13.735 --> 53:16.613
that can help get things
to go your way.

53:16.655 --> 53:21.493
Oh! Now tell me,
so when do we do this again?

53:21.535 --> 53:23.579
And when am I getting my cut?

53:24.538 --> 53:29.042
Oh yes of course,
it's time you get your cut.

53:30.085 --> 53:31.837
Ah, this is all?

53:31.879 --> 53:33.672
Ah, why do you love money
so much.

53:33.714 --> 53:35.841
This is enough.

53:35.883 --> 53:39.678
Now tell me,
when are we doing this again?

53:39.720 --> 53:42.973
Don't be so greedy,
this requires ingredients

53:43.015 --> 53:45.100
and they have to be just right
to have effect.

53:46.393 --> 53:50.647
Talk to me
let's get these ingredients.

53:51.481 --> 53:53.442
These ingredients
need to be harvested

53:53.483 --> 53:54.401
and we need to do it...

53:59.031 --> 54:04.703
Just tell me where to go then
I'll go get these ingredients

54:04.745 --> 54:06.788
and we can get started.

54:08.123 --> 54:09.750
Just trust me and relax.

54:10.542 --> 54:13.795
Alright then, Blessing
if you say so I'll trust you.

54:21.011 --> 54:23.013
Let me get back to work.

54:23.430 --> 54:27.017
Listen, you know
I wanted to ask you

54:27.059 --> 54:33.232
what are you up to this Friday,
Saturday and Sunday?

54:34.733 --> 54:39.446
It's just that I'll be DJing
at this other club.

54:39.488 --> 54:42.324
You? DJing?
Don't play around.

54:43.784 --> 54:46.411
What did you think you think
I just do garden work?

54:46.453 --> 54:49.331
I hit the decks
and set the club on fire!

54:51.458 --> 54:54.294
So, I was thinking

54:54.336 --> 54:59.424
I can text you the details
and you can come?

55:12.229 --> 55:14.147
I don't like it
when they're not even.

56:58.126 --> 56:59.628
Are you still with us, sir?

58:45.275 --> 58:48.362
Damn girl, you can move!

58:48.403 --> 58:52.783
I saw the other ladies
staring at you,

58:52.824 --> 58:55.118
you were dancing so well,
getting it down!

58:55.160 --> 58:57.287
You forget I'm beautiful, hey!

58:57.329 --> 59:00.249
How can I forget,

59:00.290 --> 59:04.920
you're like the sunrise
and the sunset.

59:07.881 --> 59:08.924
What?

59:12.010 --> 59:13.804
Not tonight.

59:16.640 --> 59:17.683
Blessing.

59:23.230 --> 59:24.356
Blessing.

59:37.411 --> 59:38.787
She closed the door.

1:00:00.559 --> 1:00:01.602
Sir?

1:00:14.531 --> 1:00:18.702
As you know, your trial period
has come to an end.

1:11:15.776 --> 1:11:18.111
Okay, I want you
to please take his car, drive it

1:11:18.153 --> 1:11:20.030
and get rid of it somewhere.

1:16:44.188 --> 1:16:45.022
Take here.

1:22:57.811 --> 1:23:00.147
I hope you mean that,

1:23:00.189 --> 1:23:03.442
'cause if otherwise,
you'll be getting a slap!

1:23:14.870 --> 1:23:16.997
Can you tell me more
about Blessing?

1:24:20.561 --> 1:24:22.104
Talk to me, my child.

1:24:37.244 --> 1:24:38.287
They're back.

1:24:41.290 --> 1:24:42.291
The dreams?

1:24:44.251 --> 1:24:45.586
Those are your ancestors.

1:25:56.823 --> 1:25:58.200
Get up from there.

1:26:00.869 --> 1:26:02.120
Sit on the floor!

1:26:04.998 --> 1:26:06.291
Sit on the floor!

1:26:06.333 --> 1:26:10.337
I call upon you,
those who belong to the water.

1:26:10.379 --> 1:26:11.713
I call on you.

1:27:40.260 --> 1:27:43.263
I hear you, ancestors.
You've spoken.

1:27:45.349 --> 1:27:47.309
What is it?

1:27:48.268 --> 1:27:51.730
She knows...
what does she know?

1:28:33.897 --> 1:28:38.986
Allow the ancestor
to course through your body,

1:28:39.027 --> 1:28:42.406
use it as a vessel.

1:28:42.447 --> 1:28:44.241
Accept your calling

1:28:44.283 --> 1:28:46.034
and follow your path
to becoming a sangoma.

1:28:46.076 --> 1:28:47.953
I don't want this mom, please.

1:28:47.995 --> 1:28:51.164
Take it out of me, all of it!

1:29:25.532 --> 1:29:26.825
She knows my child.

1:29:29.077 --> 1:29:30.871
She knows
you get ancestral visions.

1:29:32.706 --> 1:29:34.791
She knows you have a calling.

1:29:45.719 --> 1:29:49.431
Your rejections of your calling

1:29:49.473 --> 1:29:52.100
doesn't mean
your ancestors accepted it.

1:30:01.026 --> 1:30:02.236
Accept.

1:30:03.695 --> 1:30:05.030
Accept it my child!

1:30:06.073 --> 1:30:07.366
Accept your ancestors...

1:30:09.868 --> 1:30:12.204
if you don't,
there'll be a price to pay.

1:30:16.208 --> 1:30:18.043
A lot will happen...

1:30:20.838 --> 1:30:22.714
this thing is inside you

1:30:22.756 --> 1:30:26.009
and it courses
through your veins.

1:30:26.051 --> 1:30:27.177
What I tried to do...

1:30:31.181 --> 1:30:35.561
in trying to help,

1:30:35.602 --> 1:30:38.272
was to sever their connection
to you.

1:30:45.863 --> 1:30:47.322
I almost died, mom.

1:30:49.616 --> 1:30:52.786
I greet you ancestors.

1:30:52.828 --> 1:30:55.205
I know what I did...

1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:00.377
and I'd do it again.

1:31:00.419 --> 1:31:03.630
This will require
a huge sacrifice.

1:31:17.895 --> 1:31:19.646
Come.

1:31:35.829 --> 1:31:38.916
I though you said
you no longer take those pills.

1:31:38.957 --> 1:31:40.501
I'm still taking them.

1:31:43.545 --> 1:31:44.588
Let me see them.

1:31:55.516 --> 1:31:56.725
There's nothing in here.

1:31:58.018 --> 1:31:59.311
Someone fooled you.

1:32:16.453 --> 1:32:18.038
It must be Blessing.

1:32:19.873 --> 1:32:21.416
How do we stop her?

1:32:26.547 --> 1:32:28.882
We need to do a cleansing
to protect this home.

1:33:24.938 --> 1:33:27.774
Would you like me to show you
where I get my ingredients?

1:33:30.861 --> 1:33:32.237
-Now?
-Yes.

1:33:33.488 --> 1:33:34.656
I'll be right back.

1:33:56.094 --> 1:33:57.513
My girl, speak.

1:33:58.263 --> 1:34:01.141
Speak for yourself
so the ancestors can help you.

1:34:01.183 --> 1:34:04.478
They will not hear you
if you do not speak yourself.

1:34:04.520 --> 1:34:08.023
Rid us of the darkness
and bring light upon us.

1:34:18.033 --> 1:34:21.161
Tumi, does he know
about Blessing?

1:34:26.917 --> 1:34:28.544
She's done something to him.

1:34:28.585 --> 1:34:31.797
You see my child,

1:34:32.840 --> 1:34:37.886
the ancestor cannot work
through the dead.

1:34:37.928 --> 1:34:40.722
Only the living.

1:34:40.764 --> 1:34:42.850
Blessing doesn't have
what you and I have.

1:34:43.809 --> 1:34:45.269
So, she uses witchcraft.

1:34:46.937 --> 1:34:50.148
She uses things, objects

1:34:50.190 --> 1:34:53.652
to influences those around her
to commit her evil.

1:34:54.903 --> 1:34:57.281
Like a toothbrush?

1:34:57.322 --> 1:35:00.284
Yes, a toothbrush, underwear.

1:35:00.325 --> 1:35:03.495
Others even take hair.

1:35:03.537 --> 1:35:08.542
They take and bury these
so they cannot be found.

1:35:08.584 --> 1:35:11.378
But if found,
the link is severed

1:35:11.420 --> 1:35:13.005
and their witchcraft
along with it.

1:35:13.046 --> 1:35:14.798
How do we exorcise this evil?

1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:17.426
We need to send it back
to the owner.

1:35:27.978 --> 1:35:29.271
Did you hear that?

1:35:37.196 --> 1:35:38.614
When did the dreams return?

1:35:40.657 --> 1:35:42.117
It's been a week now.

1:36:24.243 --> 1:36:26.328
Help, help me with these.

1:36:30.958 --> 1:36:32.835
What are you looking for?

1:37:01.446 --> 1:37:02.990
This is a curse of destruction.

1:37:04.324 --> 1:37:08.620
It was directed at you,
not Tumi.

1:38:12.726 --> 1:38:13.769
Kat!

1:38:14.269 --> 1:38:17.105
Tumi! Please open the door!

1:38:30.077 --> 1:38:31.161
Tumi!

1:38:32.204 --> 1:38:33.288
Kat!

1:38:33.330 --> 1:38:35.249
Open the door! Please.

1:38:36.250 --> 1:38:37.459
Hi.

1:38:41.129 --> 1:38:42.256
You left your shoes.

1:38:45.384 --> 1:38:50.222
Blessing,
please stay away from me.

1:38:50.264 --> 1:38:52.140
Come and get them.

1:39:04.862 --> 1:39:08.448
I'm sorry, Mah.

1:39:08.490 --> 1:39:12.619
I need to speak to Tumi and Kat.

1:39:15.289 --> 1:39:16.373
Come in.

1:39:28.093 --> 1:39:32.264
I thought me was a Sangoma.

1:39:32.306 --> 1:39:37.186
Sangomas are granted
the power to heal.

1:39:38.312 --> 1:39:43.192
There are indeed Sangomas
who can heal, do good

1:39:44.610 --> 1:39:47.571
But Blessing, she's a witch.
True evil itself.

1:39:47.613 --> 1:39:49.531
And she uses her witchcraft

1:39:49.573 --> 1:39:52.326
to serve and further
her own desires.

1:39:53.452 --> 1:39:58.749
Now, that you mention it,
she did help me with...

1:40:01.668 --> 1:40:05.255
What's happening?

1:40:07.799 --> 1:40:08.842
It hurts.

1:40:08.884 --> 1:40:11.136
It's tightening around me,
and it hurts.

1:40:12.429 --> 1:40:14.765
It hurts.

1:40:37.663 --> 1:40:38.914
Katlego!

1:40:43.168 --> 1:40:46.296
Let's go, the time has come.

1:41:47.274 --> 1:41:48.567
Where's my mother?

1:41:48.609 --> 1:41:50.569
You want your mother?

1:41:50.611 --> 1:41:52.362
She over there.

1:44:07.623 --> 1:44:13.003
My child,
in sacrificing my life,

1:44:13.045 --> 1:44:16.507
do not let it be in vain.

1:44:16.548 --> 1:44:20.761
Let there be light.

1:47:33.745 --> 1:47:36.415
Your ancestors
have been looking for you

1:47:36.456 --> 1:47:38.083
for so long, trying to help you.

1:47:40.335 --> 1:47:43.213
But you're ungrateful.
I wish they'd chosen me.

1:47:54.474 --> 1:47:55.893
You're right, you know?

1:48:01.106 --> 1:48:02.274
Starting right now.

1:48:03.984 --> 1:48:06.737
And I'm going to start with you!

1:52:24.369 --> 1:52:25.454
Thokoza Gogo.
