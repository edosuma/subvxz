WEBVTT

00:07.750 --> 00:10.125
- Good morning, Mom.
- Oh. Gabe, honey. We need to talk.

00:10.208 --> 00:12.458
Mom, I didn't do it!
That Principal's out to get me.

00:14.917 --> 00:16.041
It's not about the Principal.

00:16.125 --> 00:18.250
Mom, I didn't do it!
That teacher is out to get me.

00:19.625 --> 00:21.500
Gabe! You're not in trouble.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.083
Then why do we need to talk?

00:26.542 --> 00:27.959
Well, it's about your Dad.

00:28.041 --> 00:32.041
Now, you're aware
that he occasionally snores, right?

00:33.125 --> 00:35.792
Mom, the people across the street
are aware.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.375
Car alarms are aware.

00:40.959 --> 00:42.583
Kansas is aware.

00:44.625 --> 00:48.250
Well, obviously, I'm used to his snoring
because I grew up next to train tracks.

00:50.375 --> 00:52.041
But your father's been waking Toby up

00:52.125 --> 00:54.166
and I'm trying to get the baby
to sleep through the night.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.000
How does this involve me?

00:57.458 --> 01:01.000
We're going to have to temporarily change
our sleeping arrangements.

01:01.083 --> 01:02.917
Man, you're putting Toby in with me?

01:03.333 --> 01:04.667
Not exactly.

01:05.625 --> 01:06.625

ladies and gentlemen.

02:10.250 --> 02:12.417
The smartest guy at South High.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.542
What do you want, Teddy?

02:15.667 --> 02:17.917
What? Do I always have to want something?

02:18.000 --> 02:21.208
Can't I just invite you over
as a friend to enjoy some--

02:21.250 --> 02:22.709
Okay, so here it is.

02:23.959 --> 02:28.125
Um, I'm taking the SAT this weekend
and I really want to ace it.

02:28.208 --> 02:31.667
And I you my help,
since you know I scored a perfect 2400.

02:32.458 --> 02:35.625
They actually did a feature story on me
in "Overachievers Monthly".

02:37.417 --> 02:40.750
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I cut it out and put it in my scrapbook.

02:41.792 --> 02:43.250
- Really?
- No.

02:45.709 --> 02:47.458
So, what do you say? Will you help me?

02:47.792 --> 02:49.250
Under one condition.

02:49.333 --> 02:53.834
If I tutor you, you have to agree
to do whatever I say no matter what.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.083
Fine. Now just tell me
what you want in return.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.500
Do I always have to want something?

03:00.500 --> 03:03.250
Can't I just do it out of the goodness--
Okay, here it is.

03:04.959 --> 03:07.250
I want you to come to the park with me
this Saturday.

03:07.750 --> 03:09.250
Wait. You mean like a date?

03:09.917 --> 03:11.125
I would never ask you out.

03:11.542 --> 03:13.542
See, you have a boyfriend,
I have a girlfriend

03:13.625 --> 03:16.500
and most importantly,
I have certain intellectual standards.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.458
Insulted, yet relieved.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.875
So, what are we gonna do at the park?

03:22.959 --> 03:25.500
I have a very important chess match
and I'd like you to watch.

03:25.917 --> 03:27.166
- That's it?
- That's it.

03:27.542 --> 03:29.166
There's gotta be some sort of catch.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.125
No catch. Just chess.

03:31.792 --> 03:33.709
Is chess a euphemism for something?

03:33.792 --> 03:38.125
Like some sort of weird
comic book role-playing thing?

03:40.041 --> 03:40.959
No.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.792
Okay. Fine.

03:42.875 --> 03:46.959
If you tutor me, I'll come to the park
and I'll watch you play "chess".

03:48.667 --> 03:51.166
No, not "chess". Just chess.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.875
You mean, "chess".

03:55.041 --> 03:58.083
No! Not "chess". Just chess!

03:58.834 --> 04:00.542
This may be the toughest tutoring
I've ever done.

04:06.458 --> 04:09.792
Oh, that is so yummy. Isn't it good? Oooh.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.750
Charlie, have you ever seen
a cuter baby in your life?

04:13.834 --> 04:15.041
- Yes.
- Who?

04:15.125 --> 04:15.875
Me.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.542
You are your mother's daughter.

04:22.792 --> 04:24.250
Hi, Mom. Hi, Charlie.

04:24.625 --> 04:25.834
PJ, I need your help.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.250
Sure, Mom. What can I do you for?

04:29.208 --> 04:31.375
It's a fun little way of saying,
"what can I do for you?"

04:33.291 --> 04:34.166
Proceed.

04:35.417 --> 04:37.500
Okay well, I really need
to put Toby down for a nap.

04:37.583 --> 04:39.917
But Charlie wants me to read to her.
Can you do it?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.125
Oh, yeah. Sure. I got time
for a quick little--

04:42.208 --> 04:43.875
Whoa! Hello.

04:44.875 --> 04:46.041
Charlie wants this book?

04:46.125 --> 04:48.667
Would you rather change Toby's diaper?
Come on, buddy.

04:50.583 --> 04:51.875
"The Littlest Unicorn".

04:53.750 --> 04:55.375
"By Emily Prettyblossom".

04:55.500 --> 04:57.792
- Yay.
- Okay. Chapter one.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.625
"Some people say that unicorns
aren't real, but they are.

05:02.375 --> 05:06.250
They hail from a magical place
called Butterflylandia".

05:06.333 --> 05:07.709
Oh, boy.

05:09.208 --> 05:10.458
Keep going.

05:11.625 --> 05:13.792
"This is the story
of one of those unicorns,

05:13.875 --> 05:15.208
the littlest one of all.

05:15.542 --> 05:18.625
Her name was Junie.
Her real name, that is.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.375
Her mean brothers
called her "Junie the Puny Uni."

05:21.458 --> 05:23.417
- That's not very nice.
- No, it isn't.

05:23.709 --> 05:24.583
Shh.

05:25.291 --> 05:28.125
"One day, Junie and her family
went to the meadow for a picnic.

05:28.375 --> 05:31.208
The meadow was right next
to the dark forest,

05:31.750 --> 05:33.750
a place Junie was forbidden to go.

05:34.291 --> 05:35.959
But her curiosity got the better of her."

05:36.041 --> 05:38.000
- Uh-oh.
- I'm thirsty.

05:38.083 --> 05:39.750
Suck it up. Junie's in trouble.

05:47.792 --> 05:49.458
So, what's the answer?

05:50.166 --> 05:52.125
Uh...

05:52.208 --> 05:54.750
- "C"?
- No, no, no, it's "B"!

05:54.834 --> 05:55.959
Well, I was close.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.834
Teddy, this is the SAT's, not horseshoes!

06:02.750 --> 06:05.250
You know what?
We've been going at this for a while.

06:05.333 --> 06:06.583
Maybe we should stop.

06:06.709 --> 06:10.375
Stop? But the test is Saturday.
You can't stop now.

06:10.792 --> 06:11.959
Let's move on to math.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.959
- In a parallelogram--
- Yeah, Victor.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.041
I don't think I can study anymore.
I feel like my brain is full.

06:17.709 --> 06:20.291
That's the great thing about brains,
they never get full.

06:20.375 --> 06:22.458
- Even smaller ones like yours.
- Okay.

06:24.625 --> 06:27.583
I'll have you know,
my friends consider me very smart.

06:27.917 --> 06:29.375
You mean like Ivy?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.041
Well, and other friends.

06:34.750 --> 06:35.959
You mean like Spencer?

06:39.542 --> 06:40.583
Let's get back to work.

06:47.417 --> 06:50.166
"And as the sun set on the dark forest,

06:50.250 --> 06:53.291
Junie realized she would have to survive
the night alone".

06:54.583 --> 06:56.792
- Are you scared?
- No.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.000
Me either.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.417
Okay, bedtime.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.542
Five more minutes.
We wanna finish this chapter.

07:06.709 --> 07:08.750
I'm sorry, honey.
But Charlie needs to go to bed.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.875
That's the kind of parenting
that drove Junie away

07:10.959 --> 07:13.375
from the green pastures
of Butterflylandia.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.750
Okay. Well, it's bedtime

07:17.834 --> 07:19.834
and I'm from the land
of "I-don't-care-ia".

07:22.208 --> 07:23.333
Come on, Charlie.

07:23.417 --> 07:25.083
And don't worry.
I won't read ahead without you.

07:25.166 --> 07:26.208
Promise?

07:26.291 --> 07:28.125
Promise. Good night.

07:28.208 --> 07:29.250
Good night.

07:40.375 --> 07:41.375
I said good night.

07:43.959 --> 07:45.208
Oh.

07:51.709 --> 07:52.542
Gabe.

07:53.750 --> 07:54.750
Yeah, Dad?

07:55.875 --> 07:58.083
- You awake?
- No, Dad.

08:00.959 --> 08:02.083
You wanna talk?

08:02.750 --> 08:03.917
No, dad.

08:07.458 --> 08:10.083
Your Mom usually lets me talk
about my day a little.

08:10.625 --> 08:12.125
It helps me fall asleep.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.375
Okay, Dad.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.583
How was your day?

08:19.667 --> 08:21.625
Well, I was over at Mrs. Fisher's today...

08:22.750 --> 08:23.583
workin'.

08:27.166 --> 08:29.166
Had to knock down so many spiderwebs.

08:29.750 --> 08:32.250
She finally came up to me and she said,
"Bob, did you miss a week?"

08:32.375 --> 08:35.709
I said, "no, you just have
a lot of spiders".

08:39.792 --> 08:40.667
Good night.

08:45.583 --> 08:47.458
Gabe?

08:49.625 --> 08:52.166
Dad, if you can't sleep,
just watch some TV.

08:52.250 --> 08:53.834
But it's bedtime.

08:55.750 --> 08:56.917
Is it?

08:58.375 --> 09:00.625
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

09:01.125 --> 09:03.000
TV after bedtime?

09:04.166 --> 09:05.375
How often you do this?

09:05.667 --> 09:08.458
Um... This is, this is my first time, Dad.

09:13.959 --> 09:17.750
Now, if the semicircle arc "AB"
has the length six times PI.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.125
And the circumference of the circle

09:19.208 --> 09:21.417
with the diameter "BC"
is eight times PI.

09:23.333 --> 09:25.208
What is the area of the shaded region?

09:26.834 --> 09:27.792
Um...

09:28.875 --> 09:29.709
"B".

09:30.166 --> 09:31.583
- Wrong!
- Oh!

09:32.959 --> 09:34.083
What are you doing?

09:34.166 --> 09:36.208
I'm giving you a punishment
to train your brain.

09:36.667 --> 09:38.500
Victor, I'm not...

09:39.041 --> 09:40.000
a cat.

09:42.709 --> 09:44.000
Well, of course not.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.125
A cat could have solved that equation.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.083
It's midnight. We're done working.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.250
We're done? Just because...

09:52.333 --> 09:54.542
"It's midnight".

09:56.041 --> 09:57.959
Yes, that is what I said.

09:58.041 --> 10:00.166
Just without the hurtful attitude.

10:01.583 --> 10:03.333
Am I wasting my time here?

10:03.417 --> 10:05.166
Do you want this?
I don't think you want this!

10:05.250 --> 10:06.583
I don't want this.

10:07.834 --> 10:09.542
Sit down and open that workbook.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.625
That's it. We're done. You're fired.

10:11.709 --> 10:12.834
- Fired?
- Yup.

10:12.917 --> 10:15.709
Terminated, dismissed, shown the door.

10:15.792 --> 10:17.333
Ooh, we're working with synonyms.

10:18.834 --> 10:20.750
Yes, we are. Now get out!

10:21.166 --> 10:22.083
Exit!

10:22.417 --> 10:23.417
Scram!

10:30.500 --> 10:32.959
Man, watching infomercials.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.709
I've got a kernel stuck in my tooth.

10:36.834 --> 10:38.417
Doesn't get any better than this.

10:39.125 --> 10:41.375
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.792
Footsteps! Shut it down!

10:54.166 --> 10:56.667
Oh, sure. In here you don't snore.

11:00.542 --> 11:01.625
There it is.

11:02.333 --> 11:03.917
3:10 to Yuma.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.917
Rise and shine.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.458
Victor, I fired you.

11:19.792 --> 11:23.458
Wrong. The correct answer is "C",
I can't be fired.

11:38.959 --> 11:39.875
Victor.

11:40.375 --> 11:41.792
It's 6:00 in the morning.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.125
What in the world are you doing here?

11:44.417 --> 11:45.458
Where else would I be?

11:47.333 --> 11:50.125
Gee, I don't know. Maybe at home, asleep.

11:50.333 --> 11:52.875
Clutching some kind of
a Sci-Fi action figure.

11:54.709 --> 11:58.250
Teddy, you agreed to do whatever I said.
No matter what.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.125
Welcome to "No matter what!"

12:01.917 --> 12:03.125
Are you crazy?

12:03.208 --> 12:04.834
Crazy about learnin'.

12:05.083 --> 12:07.166
And that's the only time
you'll ever hear me drop a "G".

12:08.917 --> 12:11.417
Listen closely
because I'm about to drop a "G".

12:11.875 --> 12:13.083
"O" away!

12:15.291 --> 12:16.667
This is good. This is good.

12:16.792 --> 12:19.333
You're frustrated, you're angry,
you're right on schedule.

12:21.125 --> 12:21.959
Excuse me?

12:22.291 --> 12:24.333
This happens whenever I'm working
with someone.

12:24.417 --> 12:26.250
There always comes a moment
when they want to quit.

12:26.875 --> 12:29.250
Actually, your breaking point
came later than usual.

12:29.667 --> 12:32.041
Which means that you're one
of my most promising students.

12:34.291 --> 12:35.250
Really?

12:37.333 --> 12:40.250
Oh, yes. I am very impressed.

12:40.792 --> 12:41.917
You're a star, Teddy.

12:42.166 --> 12:43.750
Oh.

12:43.834 --> 12:45.750
I don't know about star.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.166
Is my star ready to get to work now?

12:50.250 --> 12:51.875
Would you stop that?

12:54.917 --> 12:56.709
I'm gonna get dressed. I'll be right back.

12:58.917 --> 13:00.792
Star.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.375
- Hey, mom.
- Hi.

13:16.834 --> 13:17.917
Help me out here.

13:19.875 --> 13:21.250
I'm Mezrab.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.041
Help me out a little more.

13:28.125 --> 13:32.417
I'm Mezrab Magicpenny,
the legendary half-wizard, half-unicorn,

13:32.500 --> 13:34.333
who Junie meets in the dark forest.

13:35.458 --> 13:37.709
I thought this would help make
the story come alive.

13:38.166 --> 13:39.250
For Charlie?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.208
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.917
Well, honey, I'm sorry.
Charlie's still sleeping.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.917
- Well, should I wake her up?
- Yeah, you know what?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.834
Let's wake up Toby too. Make it a party.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.041
- Okay!
- No! Get back in here!

13:54.333 --> 13:55.583
I'm kidding.

13:55.667 --> 13:58.000
You can't read to Charlie this morning.
She's got preschool.

13:58.083 --> 13:59.583
Aw, man.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.875
Well, can I at least have some breakfast?

14:02.959 --> 14:03.834
Sure.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.583
Have a bagel.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.709
What, no cream cheese?

14:17.625 --> 14:19.625
If you don't know then leave it blank.

14:19.709 --> 14:21.667
When you score high there's me to thank!

14:22.917 --> 14:24.959
Geometry is really a breeze.

14:25.041 --> 14:27.000
Right triangles are 90 degrees.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.667
Sound off! One, two!

14:29.750 --> 14:31.834
PI is 3.14.

14:32.792 --> 14:34.542
Come on now, let's hear that voice.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.750
Never guess on multiple choice.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.709
Go ahead and do one more!

14:38.792 --> 14:40.542
Eight squared is 64!

14:42.542 --> 14:44.417
Next time we should take a car.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.500
I'm not used to running this far.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.041
Oh, yes! Yes!

15:33.959 --> 15:35.125
What time is it?

15:35.208 --> 15:36.709
It's 1:00 in the morning.

15:37.125 --> 15:39.041
Also known as story time.

15:39.917 --> 15:41.041
Okay, where were we?

15:41.458 --> 15:43.750
Oh, yeah. Junie was at the Cave
of Shadows.

15:44.458 --> 15:48.583
As Junie entered the cave,
she was scared, but also very curious".

15:48.667 --> 15:50.625
She crept ahead cautiously".

15:50.709 --> 15:51.917
I'm tired.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.208
Yeah, well, so was Junie.
But she keeps going.

15:56.625 --> 15:58.834
All-night bowling. Dad, you're an animal!

15:59.125 --> 16:00.792
- PJ?
- Dad?

16:00.875 --> 16:03.041
- Where are you going?
- Uh, nowhere.

16:03.375 --> 16:05.166
- Why is Charlie up?
- No reason.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.709
- Why is Gabe up?
- No reason.

16:08.959 --> 16:10.000
What's with the book?

16:10.375 --> 16:11.583
What's with the bowling ball?

16:14.166 --> 16:15.417
None of this ever happened.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.750
None of what ever happened?

16:17.959 --> 16:19.583
Let's go, Dad.
He can keep this up all night.

16:19.667 --> 16:20.709
Keep what up all night?

16:26.083 --> 16:29.000
"Suddenly two bright green eyes
opened wide

16:29.083 --> 16:30.709
and lit up the rocky den.

16:30.792 --> 16:34.875
And Junie stood face-to-face
with a giant fire-breathing dragon!

16:35.291 --> 16:38.250
- He opened his mouth and roared--"
- PJ?

16:39.834 --> 16:40.834
Mom!

16:41.625 --> 16:42.792
What are you doing?

16:43.083 --> 16:44.458
What are you doing?

16:46.542 --> 16:48.166
That only works with your Dad.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.333
What's going on here?

16:50.417 --> 16:53.250
It was Charlie's idea.
She wanted to finish the book.

16:53.667 --> 16:57.041
Oh, okay. So, Charlie got up
in the middle of the night,

16:57.125 --> 17:00.417
called you at your apartment
and told you to come over for a book sesh?

17:01.875 --> 17:03.041
She's a scamp.

17:03.959 --> 17:06.417
Mmm. Come on, Charlie.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.834
Ah, okay.

17:10.041 --> 17:11.208
Good night, PJ.

17:11.875 --> 17:14.333
- Well, what's she doing tomorrow?
- Preschool.

17:14.417 --> 17:17.083
Again? That's every day now?

17:25.959 --> 17:27.625
- Morning, Gabe.
- I want him out.

17:27.917 --> 17:29.458
- Who?
- Dad.

17:29.792 --> 17:32.750
I haven't slept a wink in 48 hours.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.750
Except a quick little nap
during math class.

17:36.542 --> 17:38.000
Is this about his snoring?

17:39.041 --> 17:42.583
No! I gave him a taste of freedom
and he went crazy.

17:42.667 --> 17:45.625
Yeah. Dad does better with rules.

17:46.041 --> 17:48.417
Lots and lots of rules.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.375
I can't do it anymore.
You gotta take him back. Tonight.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.375
Calm down, okay?

17:54.458 --> 17:56.667
This is your dad we're talking about.

17:57.041 --> 18:00.166
Let's show a little respect.
We'll flip a coin.

18:02.500 --> 18:05.291
- Heads, you're stuck with him.
- Tails, he's my problem.

18:05.625 --> 18:06.500
Deal.

18:06.959 --> 18:08.834
Please be tails. Please be tails.
Please be tails.

18:08.917 --> 18:10.625
Hey. Whatcha doing?

18:10.959 --> 18:12.500
Fighting over you.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.125
So, who won?

18:15.792 --> 18:17.000
Aw! Gabe!

18:17.083 --> 18:18.000
Yes!

18:21.250 --> 18:22.417
Welcome back.

18:32.417 --> 18:35.000
- Hi.
- So? How'd the test go?

18:35.083 --> 18:40.500
Well, of course I won't know for a while,
but I think I did really well.

18:41.041 --> 18:42.542
Now, in accordance with our agreement,

18:42.625 --> 18:44.291
you need to accompany me
to my chess match.

18:44.375 --> 18:47.917
Right, right, the "chess match".

18:48.875 --> 18:50.792
- Teddy, it's just a chess match.
- Sure.

18:51.625 --> 18:56.333
Okay. Well, what do I have to wear?
A bird suit or a robot outfit?

18:57.500 --> 18:59.375
Actually, what you have on now is perfect.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.333
Come on, Andrew. It's your move.

19:08.834 --> 19:11.000
It is? Oh, right.

19:20.083 --> 19:21.041
Checkmate.

19:22.041 --> 19:22.917
What?

19:24.041 --> 19:25.000
No! It can't be!

19:26.125 --> 19:27.625
Curse you, Deleseur!

19:33.375 --> 19:35.667
We're done here. Thank you, Teddy.

19:38.667 --> 19:39.709
Nerd bait.

19:41.375 --> 19:43.000
Not my finest hour.

19:50.041 --> 19:55.500
Well, Charlie. I got my SAT results back,
and let's just say I did pretty well.

19:55.834 --> 19:58.250
I'm trying not to be supercilious.

19:59.834 --> 20:00.959
Did I use that right?

20:01.959 --> 20:03.542
Who cares? Test's over.

20:04.667 --> 20:05.667
Hey, check it out.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.750
The sequel to "The Littlest Unicorn"
just came out.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.583
"Revenge of The Littlest Unicorn".

20:11.208 --> 20:12.166
Have you seen Charlie?

20:12.250 --> 20:16.417
Uh, yeah. And she told me to tell you
that she's not home.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.917
Man! Well, who am I supposed
to read this to?

20:21.792 --> 20:23.333
Hello, Toby!

20:24.500 --> 20:26.250
Okay, chapter one.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.792
"Junie had an axe to grind"...

20:29.250 --> 20:32.959
Well, sounds like there's gonna be
a beat down in Butterflylandia.

20:33.792 --> 20:36.375
Better wish Junie some good luck, Charlie.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.417
Charlie, are you ready
to go to the park now?

20:43.625 --> 20:44.458
No!

20:46.333 --> 20:48.542
PJ, thanks to that stupid book
you read her

20:48.625 --> 20:50.166
Charlie's afraid to go outside.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.375
She thinks there's a dragon out there.

20:52.500 --> 20:53.458
There is.

20:56.208 --> 20:57.542
Will you please explain to your sister

20:57.625 --> 20:59.375
the difference between what's real
and what's not?

20:59.458 --> 21:01.041
Okay, Charlie. It's very simple.

21:01.917 --> 21:04.250
Unicorns are real, dragons are not.

21:06.625 --> 21:07.959
Okay. Are you ready to go now?

21:08.041 --> 21:08.917
No.

21:09.875 --> 21:12.333
Okay, mom. I got this.
Charlie, there is no dragon out there.

21:12.417 --> 21:13.709
Look, I'll show you.

21:27.625 --> 21:28.625
Told you.
