[Beth] God, I
love how the trees

00:16.042 --> 00:17.792
are framed by the
sky, don't you?

00:17.792 --> 00:19.708
[birds chirping]

00:23.833 --> 00:26.708
[chuckles] When Ruth sees this
painting at the art gallery,

00:26.708 --> 00:29.625
she is going to lose her mind.

00:30.750 --> 00:31.708
What do you think, Cass?

00:34.583 --> 00:35.375
Cassie?

00:39.583 --> 00:40.417
Cassie.

[disquieting music]

00:53.542 --> 00:54.667
No.

01:34.083 --> 01:35.583
[Dan] You okay?

01:37.083 --> 01:38.792
Has she been
fussing a long time?

01:39.875 --> 01:40.708
Barely started up.

01:43.042 --> 01:45.000
But your mom ears
are in full effect.

01:45.125 --> 01:47.083
I've always been a
light sleeper, Dan.

01:48.042 --> 01:50.667
True, medically, when
you become a mother,

01:50.792 --> 01:52.083
your sleep cycles change.

01:53.875 --> 01:55.958
I didn't medically
become a mother.

01:55.958 --> 01:57.500
I can't have kids remember.

01:58.583 --> 02:01.667
Situationally, it, it's,
it's really the same thing.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.500
[Beth] Just...

02:06.250 --> 02:08.042
Can we just stop
diagnosing me?

02:08.125 --> 02:09.583
I'm not your patient.

02:11.250 --> 02:12.125
Okay, okay, all right.

02:12.208 --> 02:13.542
It's the force of habit.

02:18.083 --> 02:21.083
[disquieting music]

02:28.083 --> 02:29.250
Is it a nightmare?

02:31.542 --> 02:32.875
What?

02:33.875 --> 02:37.125
Well, you're making a lot
of sounds in your sleep.

02:37.208 --> 02:39.083
It's, it sounded like a
nightmare, but, you know,

02:39.167 --> 02:41.667
here I go again diagnosing.

02:41.708 --> 02:42.833
It wasn't a nightmare.

02:42.958 --> 02:44.792
Look, I'll be fine, don't worry.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.125
Oh, honey.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.208
Here we are.

02:54.958 --> 02:56.708

03:59.875 --> 04:01.167
God, oh, you scared me.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.208
I scared you?

04:03.208 --> 04:04.333
Yeah, I just jumped
outta my skin.

04:04.375 --> 04:05.917
Didn't you see me?

04:10.375 --> 04:11.833
I gotta go to the clinic.

04:29.000 --> 04:29.750
What's wrong?

04:32.042 --> 04:33.042
[sighs] Nothing.

04:33.042 --> 04:34.083
Nothing?

04:34.375 --> 04:35.542
I, I just put my hand
on your shoulder,

04:35.542 --> 04:37.417
you acted like I
was an ax murderer.

04:37.417 --> 04:40.042
Well, I guess you married
a crazy lady then.

04:40.125 --> 04:41.167
[Dan] Hon--

04:41.208 --> 04:42.250
What?

04:42.625 --> 04:44.292
This house is a little
creepy, don't you think?

04:44.375 --> 04:47.292
No, I, I happen to think
it's quite nice, actually.

04:47.375 --> 04:48.375
I mean, look at it.

04:50.750 --> 04:54.000
We live eight miles
away from humans.

04:54.083 --> 04:55.333
Dan, we've been here two weeks

04:55.375 --> 04:57.000
and I've seen the same
squirrel twenty times.

04:57.042 --> 04:59.000
And I'm starting to imagine
people outside in the bushes.

04:59.083 --> 05:01.333
Aren't you the one who
wanted to get outta the city?

05:01.375 --> 05:02.417
Yeah, I wanted to
leave our neighborhood,

05:02.417 --> 05:04.250
but not escape life itself.

05:05.875 --> 05:08.833
You said you wanted
to go somewhere safe

05:08.875 --> 05:10.083
and be closer to nature.

05:10.208 --> 05:14.250
Well, look, there's nature
and this is small-town-safe.

05:14.250 --> 05:16.000
Well, then, I guess
I'm happy, huh?

05:19.375 --> 05:21.333
Ugh, I'm sorry.

05:21.417 --> 05:22.417
Okay. I'm sorry.

05:23.375 --> 05:26.042
[gentle music]

05:28.292 --> 05:29.750
I'm just worried about her.

05:30.375 --> 05:32.750
[Anna babbling]

05:34.167 --> 05:35.500
She never reaches for me.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.417
[Beth] I don't know.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.417
Hey, look, I'm your mom.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.167
[Anna babbling]

05:47.292 --> 05:49.375
You're supposed to reach for me.

05:51.083 --> 05:52.042
[Dan] She loves you, honey.

05:53.375 --> 05:55.333
I didn't say she
didn't love me.

05:59.833 --> 06:02.500
Look, you just, you
gotta get out there.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.958
Start talking to some
people, you know,

06:05.042 --> 06:06.500
be a part of the community.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.292
I do talk to people, okay?

06:09.375 --> 06:12.958
The grocery store counter
people, sales people.

06:14.042 --> 06:16.417
That's not what I'm
talking about, you know it.

06:19.458 --> 06:21.333
-Oh, you think so.
-Yeah, yeah.

06:25.583 --> 06:28.167
I love you and I just, I,
I want you to be happy.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.833
That's it.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.958
I am happy.

06:33.167 --> 06:34.833
I'll see you later.

Do you wanna go
shopping, little girl?

07:08.833 --> 07:12.042
I know, me neither. But it
won't take that long.

07:12.042 --> 07:13.000
[Anna babbling]

07:13.833 --> 07:16.500

watched or am I losing my mind?

07:41.042 --> 07:42.917
That's what you always say.

07:43.042 --> 07:45.208
You know your mom
isn't crazy, I promise.

07:45.208 --> 07:47.167
And I'm gonna do like
your annoying daddy says,

07:47.208 --> 07:49.833
and try to be happy. [sighs]

Great job.

Good job, ooh, you're
getting so big.

08:09.542 --> 08:10.500
Yeah.

08:12.375 --> 08:13.125
Here we go.

08:14.375 --> 08:15.250
In you go.

Look, I, I have
mace in my purse.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.625
Your purse is in the back seat.

08:48.167 --> 08:49.583
[Beth] Are you threatening me?

08:50.667 --> 08:52.583
You should leave here.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.208
Well, I'm trying,
but you're in my way.

08:55.208 --> 08:56.250
I don't mean here.

08:58.292 --> 08:59.542
I mean here.

08:59.542 --> 09:00.583
Look, you need to
get outta my face

09:00.667 --> 09:01.958
or I'm gonna put this
key in your eye.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.083
I'm trying to tell you
something important.

09:04.167 --> 09:05.250
You don't belong here.

09:05.792 --> 09:07.333
Bad things will
happen to you here.

09:07.417 --> 09:09.417
Bad things will happen to her.

Get away from my
baby, you psychopath.

[tin clattering]

09:14.667 --> 09:16.000
You're not listening.

This place isn't for you.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.417
It isn't for your kid.

09:19.417 --> 09:21.167
It isn't for your husband.

You don't belong here.

Okay.

I'm, I'm just, I'm just
trying to tell you the truth.

You all right, ma'am?

09:37.500 --> 09:39.167
No, this man is
threatening me, officer.

09:40.583 --> 09:42.000
[Boyd] I didn't want
her to fall, Tim.

09:42.083 --> 09:44.000
You need to arrest
this psychopath.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.542
I don't know
about that, ma'am.

09:45.542 --> 09:46.792
What do you mean "you
don't know about that"?

09:46.875 --> 09:48.625
This man is threatening
me because, I don't know,

09:48.708 --> 09:50.042
because he's crazy.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.583
[Sheriff] Boyd, are you
threatening this woman?

09:53.708 --> 09:54.667
I didn't want her to fall.

09:54.667 --> 09:55.542
Wait, why are you asking him?

09:55.625 --> 09:56.667
I'm telling you what happened.

09:56.792 --> 09:58.417
From your point of view.

09:58.542 --> 10:00.792
Because he was threatening me.

10:00.792 --> 10:02.500
Do you guys not have this
word in your vocabulary?

10:02.542 --> 10:03.542
Threatening.

10:04.375 --> 10:05.708
We have that word, ma'am.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.708
[Beth scoffs]

10:10.708 --> 10:13.292
You're just letting him go?

10:13.375 --> 10:14.292
[Sheriff] Ma'am, look--

10:14.375 --> 10:16.958
No, don't "ma'am" me, officer.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.125
Sheriff, not officer, ma'am.

10:20.208 --> 10:22.417
Excuse me, Sheriff.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.208
What is going on around here?

10:24.333 --> 10:26.333
This is a small town, ma'am.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.083
We all know each
other around here.

10:28.208 --> 10:31.167
We don't jump at the
least little thing.

10:31.292 --> 10:32.708
The least little thing?

10:32.792 --> 10:34.250
Oh, my God.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.750
And we don't take the
Lord's name in vain.

10:36.833 --> 10:38.167
We're not like the city people

10:38.167 --> 10:40.750
moving here with their
problems and drugs.

10:40.833 --> 10:43.583
We don't like problems
and drugs around here.

10:43.583 --> 10:44.542
Well, that's a shame

10:44.875 --> 10:46.958
because I love problems
and drugs, officer.

10:47.042 --> 10:48.458
Have yourself a
nice day, ma'am.

10:48.542 --> 10:49.667
Thanks for your help.

10:51.250 --> 10:54.333
[disquieting music]

10:54.458 --> 10:55.667
[Beth] Listen to me, Dan.

10:55.667 --> 10:56.708
I had a panic attack
on the way home

10:56.792 --> 10:58.417
and nearly drove off the road.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.333
[Dan] Hon.

10:59.417 --> 11:02.333
No, don't "hon" me.

11:02.417 --> 11:04.375
We need to get
out of this town.

11:04.500 --> 11:09.208
I am just trying to say that
maybe you are overreacting.

11:09.292 --> 11:12.667
I don't overreact, Dan.

11:12.708 --> 11:15.750
We have moved
three times, Beth.

11:16.833 --> 11:19.875
First the condo's bad,
then the suburbs are bad.

11:19.875 --> 11:22.833
And now you, you just, you
cannot fault me for thinking

11:22.958 --> 11:24.417
that maybe there
is something else

11:24.500 --> 11:28.667
besides just one, admittedly
very bad, confrontation.

11:28.792 --> 11:31.458
It wasn't a confrontation.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.833
He threatened me.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.417
I, I understand
that, okay, I do.

11:36.500 --> 11:40.333
But we just sunk a lot of
money into this clinic.

11:41.333 --> 11:44.292
You're choosing the
clinic over your family.

11:44.375 --> 11:46.333
I am not choosing the clinic.

11:50.417 --> 11:52.667

12:04.875 --> 12:07.500
If we really must move--

12:07.542 --> 12:08.750
We must.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.083
Okay, fine.

12:11.167 --> 12:12.833
But that cannot
happen this second.

12:14.042 --> 12:14.833
It can't.

12:15.708 --> 12:16.792
So in the meantime,

12:17.792 --> 12:20.375
why don't we look into
getting you a therapist.

12:20.458 --> 12:22.375
A therapist?

12:22.458 --> 12:23.375
Are you kidding me?

12:24.625 --> 12:26.417
I know how you
feel about therapy,

12:26.417 --> 12:28.500
but these panic attacks
that you were having,

12:28.500 --> 12:29.917
they are getting worse.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.583
Fine.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.375
Okay, fine.

12:34.375 --> 12:36.833
I will go to therapy and
they can pump me full of meds

12:36.917 --> 12:38.333
like my parents did
when I was 13 years old

12:38.458 --> 12:41.000
if it will just get us
out of this hell hole.

12:41.125 --> 12:41.917
Okay?

12:43.750 --> 12:44.875

[tense music continues]

13:21.917 --> 13:25.417
[tense music continues]

13:25.500 --> 13:26.292
So Beth,

13:27.708 --> 13:28.750
what's going on?

13:29.667 --> 13:30.542
[Beth] I hate this town.

13:31.875 --> 13:33.708
I hate the people
in this town.

13:33.708 --> 13:35.458
And my husband
demands I do therapy.

13:37.958 --> 13:40.917
Have you had any difficult
incidents recently?

13:44.417 --> 13:45.167
Yeah.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.292
I moved here.

13:49.208 --> 13:50.000
Apart from that.

13:52.708 --> 13:55.375
Um... [sighs]

13:58.708 --> 13:59.708
I don't know, I
had an altercation

14:00.042 --> 14:02.000
at the grocery store
the other day, I guess.

14:03.708 --> 14:06.333
[ominous music]

14:10.917 --> 14:14.458
[ominous music continues]

14:17.458 --> 14:19.292
[disquieting music]

14:19.375 --> 14:20.292
What was that?

14:23.500 --> 14:24.208
Um...

14:25.958 --> 14:27.292
Nothing, I...

14:32.458 --> 14:34.917
[gentle music]

14:36.542 --> 14:37.500
I-I'm sorry.

14:39.542 --> 14:42.500
[gentle music]

14:42.542 --> 14:43.375
Sorry for what?

14:44.750 --> 14:45.500
Beth?

14:47.958 --> 14:48.958
You alright?

14:51.792 --> 14:54.458
[gentle music]

14:56.792 --> 14:57.500
-[tense music]
-[Beth sniffs]

14:57.542 --> 14:58.375
Um...

15:00.208 --> 15:01.333
Uh...

15:01.417 --> 15:03.625
[tense music]

15:09.208 --> 15:11.458
I'm so sorry, I just,
I really can't do this.

15:12.625 --> 15:15.875
[tense music continues]

15:19.958 --> 15:23.375
[tense music continues]

15:43.917 --> 15:44.917
[Woman] Careful!

15:45.833 --> 15:48.625
[Beth winces]

15:48.708 --> 15:51.625
[Beth panting]

15:51.708 --> 15:52.917
Are you okay?

15:54.625 --> 15:57.000
[Beth sighs]

15:59.958 --> 16:03.000
[disquieting music]

16:07.958 --> 16:11.708
[disquieting music continues]

16:14.375 --> 16:16.625
The ice will help
with the swelling.

16:16.708 --> 16:17.792
[Beth] Thanks.

16:17.875 --> 16:19.500
[Marion] It's okay?

16:19.583 --> 16:20.333
Yeah.

16:23.125 --> 16:25.833
Did you do the
fairytale paintings?

16:25.917 --> 16:27.500
I did.

16:27.542 --> 16:28.500
Do you like paintings?

16:29.625 --> 16:32.750
Well, I'm a painter, in theory.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.167
And what are you, in practice?

16:35.667 --> 16:36.500
A jaywalker.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.917
[both laughing]

16:39.042 --> 16:41.083
Yeah, I've been meaning
to paint some more,

16:41.167 --> 16:43.417
but who has the time?

16:43.417 --> 16:45.042
Also, the really
early fairy tales

16:45.167 --> 16:47.750
had these wonderful
heroines, you know?

16:47.833 --> 16:48.750
They did things.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.375
They were active.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.208
Not like those ones
who fall asleep

16:52.292 --> 16:55.833
hoping that Brad Pitt knocks
on their window or whatever.

16:55.917 --> 16:57.375
Yeah, I guess.

16:57.458 --> 16:59.833
Yeah, they went out and
they grabbed life, right?

16:59.917 --> 17:02.167
Cinderella, Sleeping
Beauty? Please.

17:03.542 --> 17:07.583
Now, Adamantina, now
there's a heroine.

17:07.667 --> 17:08.750
She goes to the market

17:08.833 --> 17:10.708
to sell her sister's
homespun thread,

17:10.708 --> 17:12.000
but instead she trades it

17:12.083 --> 17:14.667
for a beautiful little
doll she wants bad.

17:15.750 --> 17:17.167
Bad choice?

17:17.250 --> 17:19.167
Obviously, her sister
is beside herself.

17:19.250 --> 17:20.167
Adamantina just gave away

17:20.333 --> 17:22.625
everything they
have in the world.

17:22.708 --> 17:26.833
But as it turns out,
the doll is magical

17:26.958 --> 17:30.000
and it grants them wish
after wish after wish.

17:30.042 --> 17:32.208
She even marries a prince.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.708
But that's not why
she bought the doll.

17:33.792 --> 17:37.042
No, she bought it because
it's what she wanted.

17:37.042 --> 17:39.167
She took what she wanted.

17:39.208 --> 17:42.667
Now there's a lesson for any
little girl, don't you think?

17:44.833 --> 17:45.708
Yeah.

17:46.792 --> 17:47.542
Yeah, I guess.

17:48.833 --> 17:50.167
How's your elbow feel now?

17:51.667 --> 17:54.167
[sighs] It hurts a little,
but I'll be all right.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.500
I-I'm sorry, I, I don't
think I got your name.

17:58.583 --> 17:59.708
Oh, my goodness.

17:59.792 --> 18:00.667
I've been talking, talking,

18:01.042 --> 18:03.208
I didn't even tell you
my name. I'm Marion.

18:03.208 --> 18:06.458
I'm the preacher's wife
and I, uh, run the daycare.

18:07.458 --> 18:08.875
I'm Beth.

18:08.958 --> 18:10.458
It's nice to meet you, Beth.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.917
So do you commit suicide every
day, or just on Wednesdays?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.042
No, no, that's not
what I was doing.

18:16.042 --> 18:17.042
Oh, no, I'm just kidding.

18:17.125 --> 18:18.708
I'm kidding.

18:18.792 --> 18:20.042
But that is a really good
way to get flattened,

18:20.042 --> 18:21.750
to walk in front of a car.

18:21.833 --> 18:22.708
It was a mistake.

18:23.792 --> 18:25.750
I was just distracted.

18:25.750 --> 18:26.792
Oh, I understand.

18:26.875 --> 18:27.667
Believe you me.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.083
But I saved your life.

18:30.083 --> 18:32.625
So now we get to be friends.

18:32.708 --> 18:33.625
Isn't that nice?

18:35.708 --> 18:36.292
Yeah.

18:38.583 --> 18:41.208
Um, look, thank you
again for everything.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.792
Yeah, well small towns
can be challenging.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.667
-Yeah.
-The people can be.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.458
Well, let me tell you,
I'm not from around here.

18:48.542 --> 18:50.250
And the transition was rough.

18:51.167 --> 18:52.625
Yeah.

18:52.708 --> 18:55.000
I wanted to escape into
the woods more than once.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.833
Anyway, I think your
elbow's gonna be fine.

18:56.917 --> 18:58.958
So you can go about your way.

18:59.042 --> 19:00.125
Thanks again.

19:00.208 --> 19:01.125
Well, take care Beth.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.333
And if you ever need to talk,

19:03.417 --> 19:08.542
I make the best poppy seed
pie in the entire universe.

19:09.625 --> 19:12.792
And I'm always here,
among the angels.

19:14.833 --> 19:17.792
Well, I might have to
take you up on that.

19:17.875 --> 19:18.667
Thanks.

20:18.458 --> 20:19.333
Ah.

20:20.125 --> 20:21.333
Mmm.

20:21.375 --> 20:24.125
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[laughs]

20:24.125 --> 20:25.208
No, you have some,
come on, come on.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.000
This is for you,
this is for you.

20:28.042 --> 20:29.667
This is for you.

20:29.792 --> 20:30.917
Oh, are we gonna start
wearing this spaghetti,

20:30.917 --> 20:31.750
or we gonna eat it?

20:33.208 --> 20:35.292
Honey, if you don't eat
before Mommy gets home,

20:35.417 --> 20:37.000
Daddy's gonna get in trouble.

20:37.042 --> 20:39.542
And you know what happens
when Daddy gets in trouble?

20:39.625 --> 20:41.000
Oh, okay.

20:50.833 --> 20:55.750
Okay, what if I do like a little
like... [imitating a plane]

20:57.375 --> 20:58.292
You don't like it?

20:58.417 --> 21:00.000
You don't like it?

21:00.208 --> 21:02.292
Look, Dad slaved away
over this spaghetti

21:02.375 --> 21:05.167
for at least like
five minutes, so...

21:05.208 --> 21:07.417
Hey, you must've
had a lot to say.

21:08.542 --> 21:11.083
It's just, 'cause the
appointment, it took forever.

21:11.208 --> 21:13.292
Oh, no, we didn't...

21:13.375 --> 21:17.875
I mean, yeah, we just
mostly filled out paperwork.

21:17.875 --> 21:18.792
Oh, okay.

21:22.208 --> 21:24.917
I'm sure we'll get
deeper next time.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Yeah, all right, I just,

21:26.042 --> 21:27.917
I just want you to be happy.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
You're sweet.

21:29.042 --> 21:30.292
Yeah, and very, very late.

21:30.375 --> 21:33.667
So, sorry for the
mess, right, honey?

21:33.708 --> 21:35.792
She's very sorry
about the mess.

21:35.875 --> 21:37.000
I'll see you in a bit.

wear a bib or anything.

straight to you.

Hi, hon.

Dan?

23:51.250 --> 23:52.000
[Dan on phone] Yeah.

23:52.083 --> 23:53.250
Hon, are you there?

23:53.375 --> 23:55.167
Someone is outside.

23:55.250 --> 23:56.208
What do you mean?

23:56.208 --> 23:57.333
Someone is outside the house?

23:57.417 --> 23:58.958
I think it's that
weird guy from town.

24:00.208 --> 24:01.125
You think you
saw someone outside,

24:01.208 --> 24:03.458
or you did see someone outside?

24:03.458 --> 24:06.458
I saw somebody
outside in the bushes

24:06.458 --> 24:08.083
looking at me
through the window.

24:08.083 --> 24:09.833
Look, Dan, please come home.

24:09.875 --> 24:11.833
If you think you
saw someone outside,

24:11.875 --> 24:13.667
you should call the police.

24:13.708 --> 24:16.083
No, I'm not gonna call the
sheriff, that guy's crazy.

24:16.208 --> 24:17.208
He's not gonna do anything.

24:17.333 --> 24:18.958
Dan, just please come home.

24:19.042 --> 24:22.250
Honey, I am, I, I'm
just about to leave.

24:22.333 --> 24:24.333
Dan, please.

24:24.333 --> 24:25.458
Okay.

24:25.542 --> 24:27.042
Okay, I'll call the sheriff.

24:27.042 --> 24:28.583
Oh, you think if
you call the sheriff

24:28.667 --> 24:29.875
that's gonna change anything,

24:30.167 --> 24:33.167
well, he's probably cousins
with that guy or something.

24:33.292 --> 24:35.375
You don't believe me, do you?

24:35.375 --> 24:37.167
I didn't say that.

24:37.250 --> 24:40.042
[laughs] You didn't have
to say anything, Dan.

24:40.125 --> 24:41.458
Everything that you're doing

24:41.625 --> 24:44.125
is showing me exactly what
you think and how you feel.

24:44.208 --> 24:47.125
Look, do you know, you want
me to choose how I'm feeling?

24:47.208 --> 24:49.833
That I feel unhappy all the
time and scared all the time.

24:49.917 --> 24:51.625
You think I'm choosing this?

24:51.625 --> 24:53.667
Look, I, my gut is telling me

24:53.708 --> 24:55.167
that there's something
wrong with this town.

24:55.167 --> 24:57.542
Okay, I, I, I understand.

Hi, there, honey.

25:54.542 --> 25:56.542
[Beth] Ah, what are
you doing here?

25:56.625 --> 25:58.333
Well, you never came
by for that pie,

25:58.375 --> 26:00.000
so I thought I'd
bring it to you.

How did you know
where we lived?

26:04.042 --> 26:06.167
There's only so many
people in this town.

26:07.875 --> 26:10.708
Are you having a very
scary surprise party?

26:12.542 --> 26:14.250
I thought I saw
someone outside.

26:15.542 --> 26:16.667
Well, you did, me.

26:17.667 --> 26:20.500
Oh, I doubt you were
hiding in the bushes.

26:20.542 --> 26:22.417
Well, yeah, that doesn't
sound like me to me,

26:22.417 --> 26:23.708
but I don't know.

26:26.333 --> 26:27.292
You worried, honey?

26:29.625 --> 26:31.167
Do you wanna go check it out?

26:32.375 --> 26:33.417
Sure.

26:33.417 --> 26:34.333
Okay.

26:38.375 --> 26:39.208
[Marion] Let's go.

26:40.708 --> 26:43.792
[disquieting music]

26:49.375 --> 26:52.208
[insects chirping]

26:57.833 --> 27:01.083
-[insects continue chirping]
-[disquieting music]

27:01.167 --> 27:02.708
[Marion] You think somewhere
around here?

27:02.792 --> 27:05.167
Um, yeah, I think so.

27:08.625 --> 27:10.875
Hmm, well, trust your instincts.

27:11.042 --> 27:11.750
He was here?

27:13.333 --> 27:14.333
Yeah.

27:14.417 --> 27:16.333
Are you looking for footprints?

27:16.417 --> 27:18.250
My dad used to be
a hunter, yeah.

27:18.250 --> 27:20.750
Not a very good shot,
but a hell of a tracker.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.750
I don't know.

27:23.875 --> 27:26.167
Maybe we should just
check in the daylight.

27:26.208 --> 27:27.042
Yeah.

27:28.208 --> 27:31.125
[disquieting music]

27:35.250 --> 27:38.625
[insects chirping]

27:38.625 --> 27:42.375
[disquieting music]

27:42.500 --> 27:43.333
I mean, I am nuts.

27:43.417 --> 27:45.208
I have completely lost it.

27:45.292 --> 27:48.250
I'm starting to imagine
people in my backyard.

27:49.542 --> 27:50.667
Well, maybe whoever he is

27:50.750 --> 27:52.667
is really good at
covering his tracks.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.208
Would you believe me
if I told you that?

27:57.375 --> 27:58.167
I would.

27:59.333 --> 28:00.250
But I'm very trusting.

28:01.792 --> 28:03.292
Maybe I should work on that.

28:04.458 --> 28:06.750
Well, you get it by giving it.

28:08.542 --> 28:10.250
[Beth laughs]

28:10.375 --> 28:11.167
What?

28:12.708 --> 28:13.875
Get it by giving it?

28:14.792 --> 28:16.667
Ooh, you dirty minded thing.

28:17.542 --> 28:18.750
[Beth] What can I say?

28:19.708 --> 28:21.542
It's good to see you laughing.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.167
Well, this pie,

28:24.292 --> 28:25.708
wow.

28:25.708 --> 28:26.917
That's what he said.

28:28.708 --> 28:31.667
Mm, I see what you did there.

28:31.708 --> 28:33.750
I keep calling you
'cause you hung up.

28:33.750 --> 28:34.833
I thought something
had happened.

28:34.875 --> 28:36.417
Oh, babe, I'm so sorry.

28:36.417 --> 28:38.458
Um, this is Marion.

28:38.542 --> 28:39.708
-Hi, I'm Marion.
-How are you?

28:39.708 --> 28:41.625
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-We're, we're fine.

28:41.625 --> 28:43.417
It was just a misunderstanding.

28:43.542 --> 28:44.333
Okay.

28:44.375 --> 28:45.292
All right, it's good.

28:45.375 --> 28:47.042
You ladies have a pie.

28:47.167 --> 28:49.250
Sorry, I gotta go
catch my breath.

28:49.333 --> 28:49.833
Nice to meet you.

28:49.875 --> 28:50.875
Nice to meet you.

28:52.542 --> 28:53.708
He cares.

28:54.792 --> 28:55.917
He's so sweet.

29:00.542 --> 29:02.125
[Beth] I know. I'm gonna have to
get that recipe from you.

29:02.125 --> 29:04.792
-Oh, absolutely, yes.
-It was so good.

29:04.875 --> 29:06.625
Nice car.

29:06.625 --> 29:08.583
Oh, please call
the grandma police.

29:08.667 --> 29:10.333
I got a nice truck
at home though.

29:10.375 --> 29:11.542
It's my baby.

29:11.542 --> 29:12.833
Well, one of my babies.

29:13.875 --> 29:16.333
How you feeling
about your baby?

29:16.417 --> 29:17.542
What?

29:17.667 --> 29:18.500
That bad?

29:19.500 --> 29:21.083
Uh, no, not bad.

29:21.208 --> 29:23.417
I, I love her.

29:23.542 --> 29:24.542
You know how it is.

29:26.083 --> 29:26.875
How is it?

29:28.125 --> 29:32.208
She's, I don't know if you
know this, but she's adopted.

29:33.375 --> 29:34.333
Oh, no.

29:34.375 --> 29:35.583
I, I didn't realize that.

29:35.667 --> 29:37.583
Whoa, well, that's wonderful.

29:37.667 --> 29:40.542
Yeah, yeah, it's, it's great.

29:40.542 --> 29:41.500
Amazing.

29:41.708 --> 29:42.792
All I ever wanted
was to be pregnant

29:42.792 --> 29:44.167
and have a smashing art career.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.917
But when that didn't work out,

29:46.000 --> 29:49.375
she kind of, kind of
fell right into our laps.

29:52.542 --> 29:54.833
But it is hard, I mean.

29:54.917 --> 29:58.000
Sometimes I feel like we
don't connect, you know?

29:59.042 --> 30:01.833
I don't know, but talking
to you makes me feel better.

30:01.917 --> 30:03.292
But maybe it was the pie.

30:03.375 --> 30:04.667
[both laughing]

30:04.708 --> 30:06.792
But seriously, thank
you for everything.

30:06.875 --> 30:07.958
I really appreciate it.

30:08.042 --> 30:09.833
Oh, please, it's nothing.

30:09.875 --> 30:12.042
No, really, it means a lot.

30:12.042 --> 30:14.917
If you ever need anything
or want anything,

30:14.917 --> 30:16.542
just let me know.

30:16.625 --> 30:17.917
I just want you to be happy

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
and maybe come by
the church sometime.

30:21.875 --> 30:23.542
Oh, it's a lovely community.

30:23.625 --> 30:25.750
And you can meet my husband

30:25.750 --> 30:28.333
and I run a daycare
like nobody's business,

30:28.417 --> 30:31.583
which I think your precious
little one would just love.

30:31.583 --> 30:32.917
We're not really religious.

30:33.042 --> 30:34.792
Neither is daycare,

30:34.875 --> 30:37.375
but it would give you
some time to paint.

30:37.458 --> 30:39.542
And if you're worried
about Dan's reaction,

30:39.625 --> 30:41.708
then just tell him that you're
gonna take him to brunch

30:41.708 --> 30:42.708
and surprise him.

30:42.792 --> 30:43.917
That's what I would do.

30:45.042 --> 30:46.917
You're a very
slick lady, Marion.

30:47.875 --> 30:49.458
You don't know the half of it.

30:50.542 --> 30:53.458
[disquieting music]

30:57.917 --> 31:01.917
[disquieting music continues]

31:02.917 --> 31:03.875
[Dan] All right, honey,

31:04.208 --> 31:05.875
this certainly doesn't
look like brunch to me.

31:06.875 --> 31:08.042
I don't understand why-

31:08.125 --> 31:08.958
You said you want us
to talk to people.

31:09.208 --> 31:10.750
This is the way for
us to talk to people.

31:10.833 --> 31:11.583
Okay, well, if they're
talking about God

31:11.875 --> 31:12.750
the entire time
when we're in there--

31:12.833 --> 31:13.708
It is church.

31:14.042 --> 31:14.500
Of course, they're
gonna talk about God.

31:15.042 --> 31:17.042
Which is why I
don't want to go.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.333
Oh, my gosh, are you just
gonna complain the whole time?

31:19.375 --> 31:20.708
-Yeah, actually-
-Sounds like somebody's

31:20.708 --> 31:22.000
first time to me.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.083
I don't know, call it a hunch.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.500
Hi, um, I'm Beth.

31:25.583 --> 31:26.458
Hi, Beth.

31:26.750 --> 31:28.542
This is my very
grumpy husband, Dan.

31:28.625 --> 31:29.708
Don't worry about it, Dan.

31:29.792 --> 31:31.083
I understand completely.

31:31.083 --> 31:32.708
-And our daughter, Anna.
-Yeah, nice to meet you.

31:32.792 --> 31:34.667
Well, hello there.

31:34.750 --> 31:36.500
Aren't you gorgeous?

31:36.583 --> 31:37.833
Say thank you.

31:37.917 --> 31:39.625
Why don't I walk you guys in?

31:39.708 --> 31:40.917
-Yeah, great.
-That'd be great.

31:40.917 --> 31:42.083
[Jim] Don't worry, Dan.

31:42.083 --> 31:43.708
I came in kicking
and screaming too.

31:43.792 --> 31:44.708
[Dan] Yeah?

31:44.792 --> 31:46.417
Man, how'd they get you to stay?

31:47.375 --> 31:49.708
[Jim] Well, why don't
we just take a seat

31:49.792 --> 31:51.042
and listen and see.

31:51.208 --> 31:52.958
You're gonna be just fine.

31:53.042 --> 31:55.667
[Dan] I don't have
to sing, do I?

31:55.708 --> 31:56.792
-Welcome.
-Thank you very much.

31:56.875 --> 31:57.958
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you too.

31:58.042 --> 31:59.500
[organ music playing]

31:59.625 --> 32:02.500
We're just not that into
the whole church thing.

32:02.583 --> 32:03.542
Completely understand, Dan.

32:03.625 --> 32:05.875
-Yeah.
-100%.

32:05.875 --> 32:06.667
Morning.

32:06.750 --> 32:07.833
[Anna babbling]

32:07.958 --> 32:09.000
Hello.

32:09.042 --> 32:10.625
Hey, Marion.

32:10.708 --> 32:12.792
I see you met my husband.

32:12.875 --> 32:15.042
We did, Dan's head
is still spinning.

32:16.042 --> 32:18.417
Oh, she is so sweet.

32:18.500 --> 32:19.583
Come, come sit with me.

32:20.833 --> 32:23.417
[gentle music]

32:27.708 --> 32:28.833
Good morning.

32:28.958 --> 32:31.917
[Congregation] Good morning.

32:31.917 --> 32:34.000
Abby, lovely to
see you here today.

32:36.542 --> 32:39.458
Joe, the beard is killing it,
I see you're working on that.

32:40.542 --> 32:43.000
Chloe, glad you're
feeling better.

32:43.083 --> 32:46.167
Wanna thank you guys
for coming in today.

32:46.250 --> 32:50.708
You know, I just recently
met somebody that said to me,

32:51.917 --> 32:53.958
"Yeah, I'm not really
into the church thing."

32:56.750 --> 32:57.583
No, no.

32:58.917 --> 33:01.667
That's perfectly
reasonable in my book.

33:01.708 --> 33:02.625
And I'll tell you why.

33:04.167 --> 33:08.458
If I'm being really honest.
Really, really honest.

33:10.417 --> 33:13.375
I'm not always into the
church thing either.

33:15.625 --> 33:19.792
And what I mean by that is
I'm not always into worrying

33:19.792 --> 33:21.167
about whether or
not the foyer way

33:21.250 --> 33:24.083
was vacuumed this morning.

33:24.167 --> 33:25.417
I'm not always into worrying

33:25.500 --> 33:27.000
about whether the
chairs in the basement

33:27.083 --> 33:29.208
should be fixed or pitched.

33:29.292 --> 33:30.375
I'm not always
interested in worrying

33:30.708 --> 33:33.125
about whether the parking
crew is gonna be here on time.

33:33.208 --> 33:34.458
I'm not always
interested in worrying

33:34.542 --> 33:35.917
about what I'm gonna
do when the bake sale

33:36.000 --> 33:37.208
doesn't go off as we planned.

33:40.875 --> 33:42.417
But that stuff is church though.

33:44.917 --> 33:47.500
Just trying to answer
everyday questions.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.125
But then there's
the big questions,

33:54.333 --> 33:56.167
questions that
tug on your heart.

33:56.250 --> 33:58.167
You know what I'm
talking about.

33:58.250 --> 34:01.250
Questions that keep
you up late at night.

34:03.167 --> 34:06.083
The questions that wake you
up early in the morning.

34:06.167 --> 34:07.625
Those are the questions.

34:07.708 --> 34:09.583
Those are the questions
that I'm interested

34:09.667 --> 34:10.625
in trying to answer.

34:13.250 --> 34:16.208
And I'm perfectly
comfortable telling you guys

34:16.208 --> 34:18.833
that I don't have the
answer to those questions.

34:18.875 --> 34:19.667
I'm searching.

34:21.083 --> 34:22.667
I'm searching just like you.

34:25.083 --> 34:28.083
But I believe that the Good Book

34:28.167 --> 34:31.500
is the pathway to the
answers to those questions.

34:31.583 --> 34:35.167
I believe that I can choose
to walk that pathway or not.

34:35.292 --> 34:40.208
I believe that I can choose
to walk that pathway alone.

34:40.542 --> 34:44.458
And I also believe that I
can choose to invite you

34:44.542 --> 34:46.083
to walk that pathway with me,

34:46.167 --> 34:50.500
and that my friends,
that is the thing

34:51.708 --> 34:53.750
that I'm into about church.

34:53.833 --> 34:56.667
The togetherness, the "we",

34:57.583 --> 35:00.917
the walking hand in
hand to find the answers

35:01.000 --> 35:02.750
to those big questions.

35:04.000 --> 35:04.833
So,

35:07.167 --> 35:10.292
Chloe, would you
care to walk with me?

35:12.125 --> 35:13.083
How about you?

35:14.125 --> 35:15.833
Would you care to walk with me?

35:15.917 --> 35:16.708
How about you?

35:19.250 --> 35:20.750
Would you care to walk with me?

35:25.208 --> 35:27.958
You are a lady
with a sleepy baby.

35:28.042 --> 35:29.083
-You wanna lay her down?
-[Anna moaning]

35:29.167 --> 35:30.250
-We have a nap room.
-Yes, please.

35:30.333 --> 35:32.125
Looks like they're
gonna be a while.

35:32.125 --> 35:33.125
Marion, always good to see you.

35:33.208 --> 35:33.875
Good to see you too.

35:34.083 --> 35:36.667
Beth, my door is always open.

35:36.708 --> 35:38.875
-Hey.
-[Anna moaning]

35:43.833 --> 35:46.542
[wine splashing]

35:48.042 --> 35:49.000
Her first nap's
already wearing off.

35:49.042 --> 35:50.917
[Marion] They change fast.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.417
You gotta hang on for the
ride, but not too tightly.

35:54.417 --> 35:56.167
I consider that a general rule.

35:57.083 --> 35:59.833
Yeah, I have a problem
with letting things go.

36:03.000 --> 36:03.792
What things?

36:08.042 --> 36:08.792
It's okay.

36:10.042 --> 36:10.833
You can tell me.

36:13.292 --> 36:16.375
[disquieting music]

36:20.208 --> 36:21.708
I had a friend that died.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.083
She died in the-

36:27.167 --> 36:28.167
In the woods?

36:31.333 --> 36:33.333
You make no bones
about hating the woods.

36:34.750 --> 36:37.250
It's like you're mad
at every tree God made.

36:38.458 --> 36:40.958
It doesn't take a genius to
put two and two together.

36:44.125 --> 36:45.375
It's that obvious, huh?

36:47.000 --> 36:48.667
Hmm.

36:48.708 --> 36:50.375
Not at all.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.208
You got your secrets, girl.

36:53.292 --> 36:54.667
It's okay.

36:54.750 --> 36:55.750
I got mine too.

36:58.625 --> 37:00.833
I have quite the past myself.

37:03.042 --> 37:04.208
I, uh...

37:05.125 --> 37:06.333
I came to the church.

37:07.542 --> 37:12.875
I came to Jim after, well, a
little bit too much living,

37:13.042 --> 37:14.167
if I'm being honest.

37:14.250 --> 37:16.208
I had my wild child days.

37:17.333 --> 37:18.750
I still think about them.

37:19.875 --> 37:21.958
Were you a wild girl, Beth?

37:22.042 --> 37:23.833
[scoffs] No.

37:26.042 --> 37:26.833
No, but

37:30.833 --> 37:31.625
I knew one.

37:34.958 --> 37:37.250
It's hard to be there
for people sometimes.

37:39.083 --> 37:40.000
Yeah, it is.

37:43.875 --> 37:46.333
[phone jingles]

37:48.333 --> 37:50.833
[Beth laughs]

37:50.875 --> 37:52.250
My husband groused
the whole way here,

37:52.250 --> 37:54.417
and now he wants to
have drinks with Jim.

37:55.333 --> 37:57.000
He wants a play date.

37:57.208 --> 37:58.375
He wants a play date.

37:59.417 --> 38:00.750
Let's have some play dates then.

38:00.750 --> 38:04.167
Ah, I guess we need to
schedule a play date.

38:04.250 --> 38:05.792
-[glasses clinking]

[mysterious music continues]

42:08.542 --> 42:11.500
[doorbell rings]

42:24.458 --> 42:25.333
Oh.

42:25.375 --> 42:26.250
Hey, Marion.

42:27.542 --> 42:28.542
What's wrong, hon?

42:29.667 --> 42:30.750
The art hurting you?

42:32.458 --> 42:34.083
-Yeah.
-Okay, let's go.

42:36.292 --> 42:37.167
Go where?

42:37.208 --> 42:38.083
Where I'm taking you.

42:40.542 --> 42:42.167
And where's that?

42:44.583 --> 42:45.875
You'll see.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.292
Where's Anna?

42:47.375 --> 42:48.167
She's with Dan.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.958
[Marion] Okay, why
don't you go change?

42:52.042 --> 42:52.667
Okay.

42:52.958 --> 42:56.083
-[birds chirping]
-[mysterious music]

42:59.542 --> 43:00.625
[Beth] Ah, yeah,
I just feel like

43:00.708 --> 43:02.500
I'm always pushing
a boulder up a hill.

43:02.542 --> 43:05.083
Like I need to break
through, but I can't.

43:06.375 --> 43:09.500
I don't know, like something
needs to snap into place

43:09.500 --> 43:12.208
or snap all together,
I don't know.

43:13.208 --> 43:15.542
[birds chirping]

43:15.625 --> 43:17.375
Wait, where are we going?

43:17.458 --> 43:18.167
You'll see.

43:20.542 --> 43:22.833
Look, Marion, you know
I'm not comfortable.

43:24.417 --> 43:25.500
Well, why would you be?

43:25.583 --> 43:27.167
It's the woods,
you hate the woods.

43:27.208 --> 43:28.667
Yeah, exactly.

43:28.708 --> 43:30.208
Beth, if you want
to beat your fear,

43:30.333 --> 43:31.708
you have to face it head on.

43:31.792 --> 43:33.583
There's no other way.

43:33.708 --> 43:34.625
You can't go around it.

43:34.708 --> 43:35.667
You can't go under it.

43:35.750 --> 43:37.125
You can't just ignore it.

43:38.250 --> 43:39.292
You have to go through it.

43:40.417 --> 43:43.875
I can see what you need
because I'm on the high ground.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.375
I can see the forest clear
and you need to go into it.

43:53.500 --> 43:55.792
[soft music]

43:59.208 --> 44:01.250
My husband and I almost
bought that place

44:02.583 --> 44:04.083
for when we wanted to escape.

44:05.875 --> 44:07.208
We'd hide out here forever.

44:08.708 --> 44:10.875
And we wanted to,

44:10.875 --> 44:13.167
when we figured out
we couldn't have kids.

44:14.333 --> 44:16.792
You are so lucky to have Anna.

44:16.875 --> 44:20.833
She's so sweet and
beautiful and perfect.

44:22.750 --> 44:24.333
We would've done
anything for her.

44:27.417 --> 44:31.208
The Lord giveth to some
blessings, and to others,

44:32.708 --> 44:35.375
well, I consider it a trial.

44:35.458 --> 44:36.708
It's all about fortitude.

44:38.292 --> 44:39.083
You gotta hang on.

44:41.333 --> 44:41.958
Can you hang on?

44:45.792 --> 44:48.292
[gentle music]

44:52.917 --> 44:56.458
[gentle music continues]

45:04.125 --> 45:07.250
[gentle music]

45:08.458 --> 45:11.292
[Beth gasps]

45:11.375 --> 45:12.833
Oh, my God.

45:12.833 --> 45:13.792
What's wrong?

45:14.667 --> 45:17.292
[tense music]

45:19.375 --> 45:22.250
[Beth panting]

45:22.375 --> 45:25.500
It's just, it looks
exactly like, uh...

45:26.625 --> 45:27.458
[Marion] Like what?

45:27.542 --> 45:28.458
-Like-
-Come on, Beth.

45:28.542 --> 45:29.292
Don't give up.

45:30.542 --> 45:31.500
I can't, okay?

45:31.542 --> 45:34.208
I, I can't go in there.

45:34.333 --> 45:35.458
It's just a clearing
in the woods.

45:35.458 --> 45:36.833
[Beth] No, I can't.

45:37.667 --> 45:39.250
Why?

45:39.333 --> 45:39.958
What happened?

45:41.542 --> 45:42.625
What did you do, Beth?

45:42.708 --> 45:44.625
I didn't do anything.

45:44.708 --> 45:46.833
I, I didn't do anything.

45:46.917 --> 45:48.917
So what happened
to your friend?

45:49.000 --> 45:50.625
What happened, Beth,
just, just say it?

45:50.708 --> 45:54.417
I didn't save her, okay?

45:54.500 --> 45:56.542
I didn't save her.

45:56.625 --> 45:59.375
I didn't go after her.

46:02.542 --> 46:05.042
[intense music]

46:10.875 --> 46:12.500
Did you ever have that friend

46:12.583 --> 46:13.833
that you meant
everything to them

46:13.833 --> 46:17.083
and they meant
everything to you?

46:23.875 --> 46:25.792
[Beth VO] We met
when we were 12.

46:26.792 --> 46:28.208
We did everything together.

46:29.542 --> 46:31.833
Went everywhere together,
we were inseparable.

46:35.042 --> 46:39.375
She was beautiful and
talented and smart.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.958
An amazing artist,
way better than me.

46:45.708 --> 46:46.500
And a little crazy.

46:53.042 --> 46:55.458
She would disappear
and reappear and

47:02.125 --> 47:05.708
it was like we had this on
again, off again relationship.

47:05.792 --> 47:07.333
Everybody thought
that we were dating.

47:07.417 --> 47:10.458
Hell, we even joked
that we were dating.

47:13.583 --> 47:14.542
And one day she just...

47:17.917 --> 47:19.375
disappeared for good.

47:23.500 --> 47:26.000
I thought we were done with
all the back and forth.

47:28.792 --> 47:29.958
And then she called me,

47:31.833 --> 47:34.958
wanted to go camping and work
everything out, so we did.

47:37.833 --> 47:39.000
And when we got there, she...

47:42.625 --> 47:44.000
told me that she liked me.

47:48.125 --> 47:52.542
And I told her that I was
in love with her brother.

47:56.167 --> 47:58.708
She started begging me
to be with anybody else.

47:58.708 --> 48:01.625
And then she just ran away,

48:04.708 --> 48:07.000
and I promised myself I
wouldn't chase after her,

48:07.083 --> 48:09.833
that I wouldn't do
that to myself anymore.

48:09.833 --> 48:12.000
So I went back to
camp and went to bed.

48:15.542 --> 48:20.458
And the next morning I woke
up and she wasn't there.

48:23.708 --> 48:24.458
Cass?

48:25.917 --> 48:27.083
[young Beth] Cass?

48:27.167 --> 48:28.917
So I went looking
for her and that's,

48:30.875 --> 48:34.125
[sighs] that's when I found her.

48:38.958 --> 48:40.667
I didn't save her, I
didn't go after her.

48:42.208 --> 48:44.417
You couldn't have
saved that girl, Beth.

48:45.958 --> 48:47.500
I could have gone after her.

48:48.708 --> 48:51.750
Can you stop a freight train
by standing in front of it?

48:51.875 --> 48:53.125
No.

48:53.208 --> 48:54.708
Can you slow it down some?

48:54.875 --> 48:55.542
Sure.

48:56.792 --> 48:58.208
But that's a high price to pay.

48:59.875 --> 49:01.250
Your friend Cass, God bless her,

49:01.250 --> 49:03.125
was headed in one direction.

49:04.583 --> 49:06.167
Some people are
just built that way.

49:06.208 --> 49:07.958
They're lovely,
they're charming,

49:08.042 --> 49:09.667
they're full of life,

49:11.250 --> 49:12.417
but they're weak.

49:13.750 --> 49:15.750
And you can't stop a weak
person from being weak

49:15.833 --> 49:18.625
anymore than you can a strong
person from being strong.

49:21.042 --> 49:24.917
I don't know.

49:24.917 --> 49:26.750
No, because you
wanna blame yourself.

49:28.333 --> 49:30.667
You wanna pretend to be
weak, but you're not weak.

49:30.708 --> 49:31.708
You're strong.

49:33.042 --> 49:34.125
You're afraid of the woods.

49:34.208 --> 49:35.208
You're afraid of town.

49:35.208 --> 49:36.750
You're afraid of your past.

49:36.833 --> 49:37.708
No, you're not, Beth.

49:40.375 --> 49:41.125
Not?

49:41.208 --> 49:43.583
No, you're afraid of your power.

49:45.167 --> 49:47.708
You're afraid that someone
loved you and needed you

49:49.208 --> 49:50.792
and died because they did.

49:53.708 --> 49:55.708
Well, I don't want
that kind of power.

49:57.042 --> 49:58.667
Do you think that that matters?

49:59.667 --> 50:02.042
Do you think that any
of us have a choice?

50:03.708 --> 50:06.250
Do you think that we get what
we want, what we deserve?

50:06.333 --> 50:07.125
No.

50:07.958 --> 50:09.250
You have to grab it.

50:09.250 --> 50:11.833
You have to go for
it or you lose it.

50:12.792 --> 50:15.208
And that's just not
the woods, that's life.

50:15.208 --> 50:16.458
That's the jungle.

50:18.292 --> 50:19.750
The weak are food.

50:20.833 --> 50:22.542
The strong survive.

50:25.167 --> 50:27.792
I don't know about that.

50:27.875 --> 50:30.542
Do you wanna just give up?

50:30.625 --> 50:33.208
Do you wanna leave that
beautiful little baby behind?

50:34.708 --> 50:37.083
Or do you want to tell
Cass that you wanna live?

50:40.042 --> 50:42.083
Tell her you can't
help her anymore.

50:43.875 --> 50:45.250
Tell her goodbye.

50:48.042 --> 50:50.708
[poignant music]

50:56.292 --> 50:57.792
Goodbye, Cass.

51:02.042 --> 51:03.125
Yeah.

51:04.875 --> 51:06.208
No more crying.

51:07.292 --> 51:09.125
That's for the weak.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.750

52:34.042 --> 52:35.208
Shh, it's okay.

52:36.500 --> 52:38.625
Mommy and Daddy are busy.

52:39.625 --> 52:40.625
But I'm here.

[intense music]

52:49.208 --> 52:52.708
[intense music continues]

52:55.125 --> 52:56.625
I'll stay with you.

53:10.208 --> 53:13.792
[intense music continues]

53:18.250 --> 53:21.792
[intense music continues]

53:41.458 --> 53:43.333
[Dan] I'm just gonna get
some water real quick.

53:43.417 --> 53:46.083
[Beth] No, that'll
take too long.

53:46.208 --> 53:48.167
[Dan] Honey, um,
well, I'm already up,

53:48.250 --> 53:50.250
I'm just gonna check the baby.

53:50.333 --> 53:51.833
Okay, but hurry up.

53:53.125 --> 53:55.500
[tense music]

54:08.292 --> 54:09.042
Hurry back.

55:01.542 --> 55:04.000
[Beth] Alright, here we go.

55:04.083 --> 55:04.833
Up.

55:07.083 --> 55:09.958
[foreboding music]

55:15.042 --> 55:16.125
Okay.

55:16.208 --> 55:17.958
Mommy will be right back.

55:37.958 --> 55:38.625
What?

55:40.542 --> 55:43.917
[ominous music continues]

55:46.583 --> 55:49.792
[disquieting music]

55:54.292 --> 55:57.333
[disquieting music continues]

55:57.375 --> 55:58.667
Oh.

55:58.833 --> 55:59.667
Hey, Marion.

55:59.792 --> 56:00.583
Hi, Beth.

56:00.667 --> 56:01.375
I was just in the neighborhood

56:01.708 --> 56:03.875
with another pie,
for some reason.

56:05.417 --> 56:08.125
Did you hear a loud noise?

56:08.208 --> 56:09.417
[Marion] Like what?

56:09.542 --> 56:11.417
Like a window closing?

56:12.625 --> 56:14.042
I didn't hear anything,

56:14.167 --> 56:16.833
except the soft cries
of, "More pie, Marion,

56:16.917 --> 56:19.083
we need more of
your delicious pie."

56:19.167 --> 56:20.458
I do love your pie.

56:20.542 --> 56:21.500
Of course, hon.

56:22.500 --> 56:24.625
You know, if you, uh,

56:24.625 --> 56:26.667
want me to watch that
delicious baby of yours

56:26.792 --> 56:29.417
while you paint or
whatever, I'd be happy to.

56:29.417 --> 56:30.625
That's really sweet of you,

56:30.708 --> 56:32.500
but we're heading into
town for a checkup.

56:32.583 --> 56:34.958
I forgot some of her
insurance paperwork.

56:37.417 --> 56:39.208
Oh, okay.

56:39.208 --> 56:40.208
I'll leave the pie here.

56:41.708 --> 56:42.708
Don't mind me then.

56:44.208 --> 56:47.083
[disquieting music]

56:52.042 --> 56:54.542

57:22.542 --> 57:27.250
-[indistinct chatter]
-[glasses clinking]

57:29.708 --> 57:32.333
I wanna say during those
years I was a chef, I think.

57:32.375 --> 57:33.583
-What?
-Yeah.

57:33.667 --> 57:35.125
-Well--
-You were a-

57:35.208 --> 57:36.417
Cook is more like it.

57:36.500 --> 57:37.417
Oh, it's still,
you were a cook too

57:37.750 --> 57:40.292
I was a cook, I was a
bartender for a minute,

57:40.375 --> 57:41.958
a motorcycle mechanic

57:42.042 --> 57:43.292
-for a while.
-Oh, motorcycle.

57:43.375 --> 57:45.167
-Yes sir.
-Oh, that's rich.

57:45.208 --> 57:47.333
Hey, it took the good
Lord a minute to find me,

57:47.417 --> 57:48.208
Danny boy.

57:49.458 --> 57:50.208
And I wandered.

57:51.208 --> 57:52.000
Ooh, I wandered.

57:53.333 --> 57:56.250
Was, um, was pretty rough
and tumble sometimes.

57:59.708 --> 58:02.000
Well, I'll tell you the craziest
thing I think I ever did

58:02.083 --> 58:06.167
was, uh, fall from a rope
swing into a rushing river.

58:07.250 --> 58:10.958
It was spring break
medical school second year.

58:11.042 --> 58:15.667
And I thought I had broken
my neck and my back.

58:16.500 --> 58:17.417
[Jim] You okay?

58:17.417 --> 58:18.542
I am perfectly fine.

58:18.625 --> 58:20.667
I walked away with
a couple bruises

58:20.750 --> 58:23.708
and the knowledge to
look before I swing.

58:24.750 --> 58:26.292
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

58:26.375 --> 58:27.167
-No.
-Nothing wrong

58:27.250 --> 58:28.167
with being cautious.

58:28.292 --> 58:29.750
You got a family
to look after.

58:31.500 --> 58:32.500
I don't know.

58:32.583 --> 58:35.250
[upbeat music]

58:37.542 --> 58:38.542
I took TaeKwonDo.

58:38.625 --> 58:40.583
-Hey.
-I took TaeKwonDo

58:40.708 --> 58:41.583
for seven years.

58:41.708 --> 58:42.667
I, it was mostly
to get in shape.

58:42.750 --> 58:43.917
But let me tell you,

58:44.292 --> 58:48.333
I walked outta that class with
a tremendous... [shouting]

58:48.417 --> 58:50.417
[Jim laughing]

58:50.542 --> 58:52.667
But listen, I got a
story about a dragon

58:52.750 --> 58:53.667
I need to tell you.

58:53.750 --> 58:54.708
A story about it.

58:54.792 --> 58:55.875
-That's right.
-I love stories

58:55.875 --> 58:57.375
-about dragons.
-Yep, I was in China.

58:57.458 --> 58:59.667
Anyway, let me tell you
about it when I get back.

58:59.750 --> 59:01.375
I gotta see a man
about a horse.

59:01.458 --> 59:03.750
Yeah, see that horse.

59:03.750 --> 59:05.333
It's a horse that
meets a dragon.

59:09.875 --> 59:11.292
You should not trust him.

59:13.458 --> 59:14.333
Excuse me.

59:14.417 --> 59:15.750
Don't trust him.

59:17.667 --> 59:18.875
What, what are
you talking about?

59:18.958 --> 59:21.167
He took something
from my friend.

59:22.208 --> 59:23.458
Jim?

59:23.542 --> 59:24.375
Is that what he's
calling himself now?

59:24.458 --> 59:25.625
I, I...

59:25.625 --> 59:27.458
That, that is his name, yes.

59:27.458 --> 59:29.208
No, it's not.

59:29.292 --> 59:31.750
I don't know what his
name is, but it's not Jim.

59:32.708 --> 59:34.833
He took something
from a friend of mine.

59:34.958 --> 59:38.125
And whatever you do,
you cannot trust him.

59:38.208 --> 59:40.750
And for God's sake,
don't trust his wife.

59:41.625 --> 59:44.292
She is not who
you think she is.

59:46.792 --> 59:49.708
[ominous music]

59:49.708 --> 59:50.625
Hi, there.

59:59.333 --> 01:00:00.167
That was weird.

01:00:01.375 --> 01:00:02.208
Is it safe in there?

01:00:02.292 --> 01:00:03.125
Gonna use the head.

01:00:04.208 --> 01:00:04.875
Okay.

01:00:06.458 --> 01:00:08.917
[upbeat music]

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:12.333
Cliff, couple more.

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:13.167
Got it.

01:00:21.875 --> 01:00:22.792
Thank you, sir.

01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:24.583
For a preacher, anything.

01:00:24.667 --> 01:00:25.458
Thank you.

01:00:43.458 --> 01:00:44.833
-Hey, there he is.
-Ooh.

01:00:44.833 --> 01:00:45.875
We got another one.

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:46.667
-All right.
-Good to go.

01:00:46.792 --> 01:00:48.917
So I saw you're making friends.

01:00:49.042 --> 01:00:51.792
Yeah, I don't, I, I don't
know if I would call it that,

01:00:51.875 --> 01:00:53.042
-but, uh...
-Sure.

01:00:53.458 --> 01:00:55.417
She seemed like she saw the
martial artist in you, buddy.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.417
She looked interested.

01:00:56.792 --> 01:00:58.792
Well, you'd be surprised
how often I get that.

01:01:00.375 --> 01:01:01.792
No, she said that she knew you.

01:01:02.667 --> 01:01:04.167
Do you know her?

01:01:04.208 --> 01:01:07.000
As a matter of fact, to be
completely honest, I do.

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:08.250
Really?

01:01:08.375 --> 01:01:09.167
Or I did.

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.333
Yeah, she came
around the church

01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:13.375
a while back after a really--

01:01:13.375 --> 01:01:15.833
Well, she'd been through
a real traumatic time.

01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:17.583
[ominous music]

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:18.417
Lost her kid.

01:01:19.792 --> 01:01:20.625
-Oh, man. That's tough.
-Yeah.

01:01:20.708 --> 01:01:21.958
She came to us

01:01:22.042 --> 01:01:23.792
and she was having
trouble processing it.

01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:28.333
And she was behaving
sort of erratically.

01:01:30.542 --> 01:01:35.500
Yeah, she was telling
odd stories, and paranoid.

01:01:36.042 --> 01:01:37.375
It was so bad for her.

01:01:37.458 --> 01:01:38.333
Yeah.

01:01:39.458 --> 01:01:43.875
I mean, honestly, she
needs our prayers, right?

01:01:44.708 --> 01:01:45.875
-Sure.
-Cheers.

01:02:54.542 --> 01:02:55.792
Honey, hi.

01:02:55.875 --> 01:02:56.625
-Dan?
-Whoa,

01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:57.833
-easy.
-Yeah.

01:02:57.833 --> 01:02:59.208
-Hi.
-Where, where's your car?

01:02:59.292 --> 01:03:01.833
The car, oh, where's the car?

01:03:01.833 --> 01:03:02.958
-Jim, where's the car?
-I drove.

01:03:03.042 --> 01:03:04.417
Oh, he drove.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.000
He drove.

01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:06.583
Where's the music?

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:08.000
That's the question, and
where's your dancing shoes,

01:03:08.083 --> 01:03:08.917
-honey.
-Danny?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:09.833
-Yeah.
-I'm so sorry.

01:03:09.917 --> 01:03:10.833
[Dan] Oh, yeah.

01:03:11.125 --> 01:03:11.792
-Danny, boy, be gentle, son.
-Let's go.

01:03:11.792 --> 01:03:12.625
[Dan] I'm fine!

01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:14.667
Watch yourself, Danny boy.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:15.667
That's just [indistinct].

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.000
Why don't we, uh...

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
-I'm so sorry.
-What happened to him?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.292
[Jim] Oh, we had quite a night.

01:03:19.292 --> 01:03:20.875
[Dan] Oh, we did.

01:03:20.875 --> 01:03:22.500
-Yes, we did.
-[Beth] Quite a night?

01:03:22.583 --> 01:03:23.833
-We did, yeah.
-Yeah.

01:03:23.875 --> 01:03:25.000
Your, your boy here
got a little loose

01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:26.417
-is how I'd put it.
-Loose.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:27.583
No, I, you're loose.

01:03:27.667 --> 01:03:28.833
-You're loosey-goosey.
-I'm loose, you're loose.

01:03:28.917 --> 01:03:30.375
Yeah, this guy...

01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:31.792
Why don't we dial it
back a little bit.

01:03:31.917 --> 01:03:32.708
Lay you down, there he goes.

01:03:32.792 --> 01:03:33.667
Watch his head, okay.

01:03:33.792 --> 01:03:34.875
Let's relax.

01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:36.583
-Just relax.
-I'm so sorry.

01:03:36.667 --> 01:03:38.167
[Beth] Serious.

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:38.958
It's good.

01:03:38.958 --> 01:03:40.333
We didn't drink.

01:03:40.375 --> 01:03:41.708
We didn't drink, we
didn't, we, we had...

01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:42.833
-Quite a couple.
-Three,

01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:44.125
-four, five?
-Yeah.

01:03:44.208 --> 01:03:45.625
Five?

01:03:45.708 --> 01:03:48.917
So we, no, it's
two drinks twice.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.667
-Could have been.
-So what?

01:03:50.667 --> 01:03:51.708
-Okay, Dan, listen.
-Wait.

01:03:51.833 --> 01:03:52.833
Where are you going?

01:03:52.875 --> 01:03:54.500
There's no horse
in the bathroom,

01:03:54.583 --> 01:03:55.583
and that's where you're going.

01:03:55.583 --> 01:03:56.792
Dan, hey.

01:03:56.917 --> 01:03:58.750
-Can you, please-
-He owes me a dragon story.

01:03:58.833 --> 01:03:59.833
-Listen to me.
-Yeah.

01:03:59.917 --> 01:04:01.000
-Listen to me.
-I'm listening.

01:04:01.042 --> 01:04:03.417
[Beth] I found footprints.

01:04:04.625 --> 01:04:06.042
You found Bigfoot?

01:04:06.208 --> 01:04:07.000
No.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.500
What? No.

01:04:08.583 --> 01:04:09.583
Are you that drunk?

01:04:09.667 --> 01:04:11.667
I, no, I'm not drunk.

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:13.000
It's something different.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Believe me, there is
this woman at the bar.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.875
She said not to trust him
and not to trust his wife.

01:04:18.875 --> 01:04:19.792
What? Ssh.

01:04:19.875 --> 01:04:21.083
I, I am whispering.

01:04:21.208 --> 01:04:22.667
No, you're not whispering.

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:24.000
[Dan] It's fine.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.625
[tense music]

01:04:26.708 --> 01:04:27.708
-Listen.
-Uh-huh.

01:04:27.708 --> 01:04:29.000
I sprayed the dirt outside.

01:04:29.042 --> 01:04:30.917
I found a footprint in the
mud in the exact same spot

01:04:30.917 --> 01:04:32.000
where I saw someone watching me.

01:04:32.083 --> 01:04:33.833
-Oh, why?
-Do you not understand

01:04:33.917 --> 01:04:35.583
-what I'm saying?
-I told you I do.

01:04:35.708 --> 01:04:37.000
You just, you're so smart.

01:04:37.083 --> 01:04:38.000
-Ugh.
-You're so smart.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:39.750
Honey, this is why I, this
is why I love you.

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:40.458
This is why [kisses].

01:04:40.625 --> 01:04:41.500
-No, I love you.
-Stop, Dan!

01:04:41.875 --> 01:04:43.500
Yeah, look, she took
something from someone.

01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:44.667
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

01:04:44.708 --> 01:04:45.750
With who? Who?

01:04:46.125 --> 01:04:46.917
When we...at the bar and I
keep trying to tell you.

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:49.917
Oh, my God, I am so thirsty.

01:04:49.917 --> 01:04:52.542
Oh, hurry. [panting]

01:04:54.875 --> 01:04:55.958
[Beth] Dan!

01:04:58.667 --> 01:04:59.542
Dan, stop!

01:05:00.625 --> 01:05:01.042
I'm fine.

01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:02.708
Do we have any chicken?

01:05:02.708 --> 01:05:03.583
-What?
-I dunno,

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:05.125
I just feel really in the mood

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:06.208
-for chicken.
-Just focus for a second.

01:05:06.333 --> 01:05:09.083
-Yeah, oh.
-Why did you get this wasted?

01:05:09.167 --> 01:05:11.542
Ah, there is no good reason.

01:05:11.625 --> 01:05:12.875
[Beth] Well, how many
drinks did you drink?

01:05:12.958 --> 01:05:13.750
Ah, hmm...

01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:17.083
Three.

01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:20.625
You had three beers
and you're this drunk.

01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:21.500
Maybe.

01:05:49.667 --> 01:05:50.792
Sheriff, it's Marion.

01:05:53.042 --> 01:05:54.917
[sighs] I hate to do this,

01:05:55.042 --> 01:05:56.792
but I have to report
a child in danger.

01:05:58.917 --> 01:06:00.542
No, I'm, I'm, I'm positive.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.500
Yeah, no, there's,
there's drugs involved.

01:06:05.667 --> 01:06:08.167
Yeah, you need to come to Beth
and Dan's house immediately.

01:06:10.042 --> 01:06:10.750
I'm sure.

01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:13.792
I'm definitely sure.

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:17.625
[tense music]

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:21.583
Did you get these
beers yourself?

01:06:21.667 --> 01:06:23.292
Yes, I got the beers.

01:06:23.375 --> 01:06:25.625
Well, no, actually,
Jim got the last one.

01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:27.042
It was very nice, he
didn't have to do that.

01:06:27.125 --> 01:06:28.708
He got one of those strong ones.

01:06:28.833 --> 01:06:30.125
And they seem zingy

01:06:30.125 --> 01:06:31.792
-with the buzz on the tongue.
-Zingy?

01:06:31.875 --> 01:06:32.750
Just buzzy.

01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:34.167
But I mean, I'm not buzzing.

01:06:34.208 --> 01:06:35.875
It's just my mouth talking.

01:06:35.875 --> 01:06:37.333
Does that, Jim,
did he just leave?

01:06:37.375 --> 01:06:38.833
Jim.

01:06:38.917 --> 01:06:40.792
I'm never getting
the dragon story.

01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:41.875
This is unbelievable.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.208
Oh.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:45.042
Oh, honey, I found the chicken.

01:06:45.042 --> 01:06:46.833
It's behind the baby food.

01:06:46.917 --> 01:06:48.875
Oh.

01:06:48.958 --> 01:06:49.875
Oh, yeah.

01:06:49.958 --> 01:06:51.833

01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:07.083
Look, wake up.

01:07:07.167 --> 01:07:08.000
Look, listen to me.

01:07:08.083 --> 01:07:10.000
Anna is gone.

01:07:10.042 --> 01:07:10.958
Do you hear me?

01:07:11.042 --> 01:07:12.042
Anna is gone, Jim must have--

01:07:12.125 --> 01:07:14.375
Look, I don't know
what happened,

01:07:14.375 --> 01:07:15.875
but Jim must have taken her.

01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:17.708
Do you hear what I'm saying?

01:07:17.792 --> 01:07:19.917
I don't need to go
to practice anymore.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:20.958
-What?

[frenetic music]

01:07:27.458 --> 01:07:30.833
What do I...where
did I put my phone?

01:07:31.542 --> 01:07:32.875
Where's my keys?

Oh, my God.

01:07:45.042 --> 01:07:45.792
It was her.

01:07:47.167 --> 01:07:48.333
It was Marion.

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:50.875
Oh, my God, it was Marion.

01:07:50.875 --> 01:07:51.750
Marion took Anna.

01:07:52.042 --> 01:07:54.000
My husband and I almost
bought that place

01:07:54.083 --> 01:07:55.792
for when we wanted to escape.

01:07:55.875 --> 01:07:58.000
Look, Dan, look, I know you
can't hear me right now,

01:07:58.083 --> 01:08:00.000
but, but Marion
and Jim have Anna.

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:02.125
Just come and find me, okay?

We'll just keep going, yeah.

01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:36.125

started on my hair.

The, uh, packing still
needs to be done.

01:09:43.542 --> 01:09:45.250
Did you get the documents?

Yeah, yeah, they're on
the table right there.

01:09:50.042 --> 01:09:51.167
Where's the tithing money?

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:52.333
Boyd's getting
the tithing money.

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:54.167
Remember you asked
him to do that?

01:09:54.208 --> 01:09:55.375
Well, why isn't he here?

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.833
I-i-it's just sitting
in a safe in, in church.

Do it, Boyd.

Don't be weak.

01:10:34.083 --> 01:10:34.958
Do it for your family.

that you want to go
this route?

[Marion] Don't finish
that sentence.

01:10:49.083 --> 01:10:52.250
Don't even think about
finishing that sentence.

you know that.

Take responsibility for
yourself and no one else.

And feel peace.

May peace, mercy, and
love be multiplied to you.

[Jim] You're right.

Telly, I need you with
me, Chavez, around front.

what his state of mind is.

-Yes, sir.

You all right, Boyd?

01:11:41.208 --> 01:11:42.000
Did you find her?

01:11:43.042 --> 01:11:44.458
Did you take care of her?

[disquieting music]

01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:52.125
I didn't see her.

01:11:53.292 --> 01:11:54.458
You didn't wait for her?

01:11:56.375 --> 01:11:59.167
You told me I had to be here.

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:01.458
After you got rid of her.

01:12:01.542 --> 01:12:03.667
I didn't see her, Marion.

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:04.500
Mommy.

01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:07.458
It's not Marion, it's Mommy.

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:11.042
I'm sorry, Mommy.

01:12:13.333 --> 01:12:15.792
You said I had to hurry
here with the money.

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:18.875
I did, you're right.

01:12:20.208 --> 01:12:21.000
It's okay.

01:12:22.417 --> 01:12:23.458
We're gonna move on.

01:12:25.042 --> 01:12:27.042
The sheriff will take
care of her for us

01:12:30.292 --> 01:12:32.042
because Papa did his part right.

01:12:56.375 --> 01:12:57.375
Wake up.

01:12:57.375 --> 01:12:58.208
Hey, drug boy.

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:00.375
Wake yourself.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.500
Sheriff?

01:13:02.708 --> 01:13:03.542
Yeah.

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:07.542
You wanna tell me about this?

01:13:09.333 --> 01:13:10.583
I don't know what that is.

01:13:12.333 --> 01:13:14.000
Really?

01:13:14.083 --> 01:13:14.958
Oxycontin.

01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:19.000
It's brand name stuff, and
it's real expensive.

01:13:20.042 --> 01:13:21.667
And you've been selling it
in my town to my people?

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:24.083
-Hmm.
-That's not mine.

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:27.125
Huh, that's what they
always say, huh, Fratelli?

01:13:27.125 --> 01:13:29.083
What happened to me.

01:13:29.083 --> 01:13:29.958
You got high, son.

01:13:32.625 --> 01:13:35.000
I feel sorry for his
wife and his baby.

01:13:35.042 --> 01:13:37.000
Wait, that's it.

01:13:38.292 --> 01:13:39.958
She was telling
me, but I was too.

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:44.333
I, I just, I couldn't,
I couldn't think.

01:13:44.375 --> 01:13:45.625
-I couldn't think.
-Calm down.

01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:46.833
But I could hear her.

01:13:46.917 --> 01:13:48.042
-Yeah.
-I could hear her.

01:13:48.125 --> 01:13:49.708
She was telling me,
the woman at the bar.

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:51.667
The woman at the bar, she
was trying to warn me.

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:53.500
-Yeah, the preacher, Jim.
-Really?

01:13:53.542 --> 01:13:54.708
He set me up.

01:13:55.667 --> 01:13:57.125
That's where this started.

01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:59.167
Calm down, it's alright.

01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:00.250
I didn't listen to my wife.

01:14:03.208 --> 01:14:04.458
Beth told me.

01:14:04.542 --> 01:14:06.208
She warned me, it's Marion.

01:14:06.333 --> 01:14:07.458
Marion has the baby.

01:14:07.542 --> 01:14:08.625
No, you don't understand.

01:14:08.625 --> 01:14:09.667
Marion has my baby.

01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:11.542
Marion has the baby.

01:14:11.667 --> 01:14:12.708
Okay, where's Marion?

01:14:12.833 --> 01:14:14.250
Marion, do you know
where Marion is?

01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:15.500
-Calm down.
-Please tell me.

01:14:15.542 --> 01:14:16.458
-[Dan] Will you--
-You need to calm down.

01:14:16.542 --> 01:14:17.292
Tell me you know
where Marion is.

01:14:17.667 --> 01:14:18.000
You need to come down
to the station.

01:14:18.542 --> 01:14:20.208
Does anyone know
where Marion is?

01:14:20.208 --> 01:14:21.417
We need to find her. Right now!

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.083
We need to find her.

01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:25.542
[Marion] Boyd.

01:14:27.333 --> 01:14:29.375
Boyd, you're a good boy.

01:14:29.375 --> 01:14:30.208
You always were.

01:14:32.542 --> 01:14:35.583
First time I saw you,
beautiful little boy.

01:14:38.542 --> 01:14:42.583
Saw you with that woman,
called herself a mother.

01:14:44.125 --> 01:14:47.042
She didn't know how to take
care of a boy like you.

01:14:47.125 --> 01:14:49.708
She didn't know how to love
you right, raise you right.

01:14:51.208 --> 01:14:52.083
I knew.

01:14:53.292 --> 01:14:54.167
And now,

01:14:57.167 --> 01:15:00.583
we're finally together,
a whole family.

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:06.583
So let's dye that
scrappy head of yours.

01:15:06.708 --> 01:15:08.125
And let's start over.

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.375
Boyd,

01:15:14.542 --> 01:15:15.333
sit still.

01:15:21.375 --> 01:15:22.333
My name's Tristan.

01:15:22.583 --> 01:15:26.708
No, your name is Boyd
and I'm your mommy.

01:15:28.458 --> 01:15:30.250
[disquieting music]

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:32.333
I already have a mommy.

01:15:32.375 --> 01:15:33.833
Well, I'm your mommy now.

01:15:35.708 --> 01:15:36.875
Mommy and Boyd.

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:42.833
[disquieting music]

01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:51.125
[disquieting music continues]

01:15:55.458 --> 01:15:59.167
[disquieting music continues]

01:16:02.417 --> 01:16:03.333
Boyd.

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:05.333
-Boyd.
-Boyd.

01:16:05.458 --> 01:16:06.750
Dammit.

01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:08.167
I'll go get him.

01:16:08.167 --> 01:16:09.750
No, just stay here
and finish packing.

01:16:11.708 --> 01:16:14.250
[tense music]

01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:22.792
[tense music continues]

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:30.167
It's Boyd, I need to
speak to the sheriff.

01:16:31.292 --> 01:16:32.417
No, I need the sheriff now.

01:16:34.708 --> 01:16:37.333
[tense music]

01:16:40.708 --> 01:16:43.333
I know you're out here, Boyd.

01:16:43.333 --> 01:16:45.292
I know you're scared,
but you needn't be,

01:16:45.375 --> 01:16:46.375
it's just me, Mommy.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.083
Did you tell on us, Boyd.

01:16:51.417 --> 01:16:53.042
I know how you break down.

01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:54.917
I know everything about you.

01:16:57.875 --> 01:16:59.958
But if that girl
comes into my woods,

01:16:59.958 --> 01:17:02.833
I'm gonna have to kill her
myself because you couldn't.

01:17:04.542 --> 01:17:06.167
I'll gut anyone
who gets in my way.

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:10.708
[tense music]

01:17:15.917 --> 01:17:19.375
[tense music continues]

01:17:23.708 --> 01:17:24.750
Yeah.

01:17:25.708 --> 01:17:26.750
Boyd's where?

01:17:28.792 --> 01:17:29.500
Boyd said what?

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:32.583
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:17:32.667 --> 01:17:34.125
Tell him to get outta there now.

01:17:34.208 --> 01:17:35.833
No, I don't want
anybody getting hurt.

01:17:35.875 --> 01:17:37.750
I'm on my way.

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:39.542
Get in the front,
we gotta go now.

01:17:39.625 --> 01:17:41.417
You guys follow, come on.

01:17:41.542 --> 01:17:42.292
Let's go.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.875
[ominous music]

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.500
[ominous music continues]

01:18:15.208 --> 01:18:17.167
[ominous music]

01:18:34.667 --> 01:18:35.917
Goddammit, Beth.

01:18:37.667 --> 01:18:38.958
[Beth] What are you doing, Jim?

01:18:41.542 --> 01:18:42.667
I think you know.

01:18:42.792 --> 01:18:44.458
You don't have to do this, okay?

01:18:44.542 --> 01:18:46.833
Look, you don't have
to do this for Marion.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.417
But you see, you're
gonna take her from us

01:18:51.417 --> 01:18:52.875
if I don't, aren't you?

01:18:52.958 --> 01:18:54.792
Because she's mine.

01:18:54.792 --> 01:18:56.375
She is my child.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.875
Look, we can do
this together, Jim.

01:19:03.083 --> 01:19:04.708
No, no.

01:19:04.792 --> 01:19:09.250
You see, you don't know
her like I know her.

01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:11.833
Nobody's gonna be
able to stop her.

01:19:11.917 --> 01:19:13.458
You can't stop her.

01:19:15.625 --> 01:19:16.833
I can try.

01:19:17.958 --> 01:19:19.500
We can try together.

01:19:23.917 --> 01:19:25.625
Goddammit.

01:19:25.708 --> 01:19:26.500
Dammit.

01:19:29.542 --> 01:19:30.833
I'm sorry.

01:19:30.958 --> 01:19:32.458
I gotta do this, Beth.

01:19:33.833 --> 01:19:34.917
I'm sorry.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.458
[Anna crying]

01:19:36.458 --> 01:19:37.833
I'm sorry.

[tense music continues]

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.958
You are a faithless mother.

01:20:32.042 --> 01:20:34.125
Look, why are you
doing this, Marion?

01:20:35.708 --> 01:20:37.375
My mother was just like you.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.792
A weak, distracted,
disappointed,

01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:42.708
trivial artist who
cared more about herself

01:20:42.792 --> 01:20:44.125
than me, her child.

01:20:44.208 --> 01:20:45.583
It was always about Mommy.

01:20:47.625 --> 01:20:49.167
I would never do that.

01:20:49.208 --> 01:20:52.500
I would never leave my child
in the hands of another

01:20:52.583 --> 01:20:55.125
unless I was thinking
of giving her away.

01:20:58.125 --> 01:21:00.000
Look, I'm not listening
to you, Marion.

01:21:00.042 --> 01:21:02.000
You're an evil woman.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.333
Maybe I am, but
it's an evil world.

01:21:07.083 --> 01:21:09.583
My mother led me into it,
bought me into it, young.

01:21:10.917 --> 01:21:13.000
Evil ways, the
ways of criminals,

01:21:13.125 --> 01:21:16.958
con artists, degenerates,
but I escaped.

01:21:18.917 --> 01:21:21.458
Yeah, I escaped
because I was strong.

01:21:22.083 --> 01:21:23.083
Too strong.

01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:29.458
That's why they never let me
have a child under the law.

01:21:30.708 --> 01:21:32.583
But they let you have one.

01:21:33.875 --> 01:21:35.625
They let you have a baby.

01:21:35.708 --> 01:21:37.000
That's madness.

01:21:38.833 --> 01:21:41.625
They don't let
criminals adopt, Marion.

01:21:43.542 --> 01:21:47.833
I was meant to be a mother
to a beautiful little girl.

01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:49.083
And that's what I'll be.

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:56.083
Now, before my Daddy left,

01:21:56.083 --> 01:21:57.750
he taught me how to use a knife

01:21:59.042 --> 01:22:00.125
and I never forgot.

I, I didn't mean to. [sobbing]

01:22:55.708 --> 01:22:57.125
He's my baby.

01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:42.208
How's my baby girl
doing back there?

01:23:50.208 --> 01:23:53.250
All right, co-pilot,
what's our ETA?

01:23:55.375 --> 01:23:57.250
Oh, we're not outta
the woods yet.

01:23:58.667 --> 01:24:00.792
Yeah, we are Dan, and
we're staying out.

01:24:02.125 --> 01:24:04.750
And this time I'm
picking out the house.

01:24:09.542 --> 01:24:10.333
Okay.

01:24:13.792 --> 01:24:16.542
