00:04.795 --> 00:06.555
Car 72. No activity.

00:12.518 --> 00:14.677
How was your weekend?

00:14.678 --> 00:17.157
It's Wednesday.

00:17.158 --> 00:19.958
Is it? Jesus.

00:21.597 --> 00:23.766
You still angry about the dolphin?

00:23.783 --> 00:25.382
What dolphin? Oh, oh, oh.

00:25.383 --> 00:28.022
This enormous, giant, concrete dolphin

00:28.023 --> 00:29.741
in the back of our unmarked police car?

00:29.742 --> 00:31.661
No. Why would I be unhappy about that?

00:31.662 --> 00:33.181
I just don't understand.

00:33.182 --> 00:35.021
As my best friend, I
would have thought you'd...

00:35.022 --> 00:36.661
Can we not say "best friend"?

00:36.662 --> 00:40.500
We probably are or were
or whatever. But we...

00:40.501 --> 00:43.140
We're not little kids. We
don't have to say "best frie..."

00:43.141 --> 00:44.620
I don't have a favourite colour.

00:44.621 --> 00:46.100
- Blue.
- I don't have a favourite food.

00:46.101 --> 00:48.540
- Sushi.
- I do like sushi.

00:48.541 --> 00:51.499
- It's your favourite food.
- We're not 7-year-old girls.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.099
So can we not say,
"You're my best friend"?

00:54.100 --> 00:57.419
Oh, no one is gonna think
there is anything conspicuous

00:57.420 --> 01:00.258
about having a plaster of Paris
dolphin in the back of our car.

01:00.259 --> 01:02.258
We could just be two random,

01:02.259 --> 01:04.378
eh, marine biologists...

01:04.379 --> 01:06.018
Yeah. Yeah. We could be.

01:06.019 --> 01:09.018
But we could be two detectives
on their way to a stake-out,

01:09.019 --> 01:11.577
and one of them made the other one stop

01:11.578 --> 01:13.697
because he saw a hard
rubbish council clean-up.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.177
The first detective was like,

01:15.178 --> 01:17.377
"No, no, no, that's
really unprofessional"

01:17.378 --> 01:19.217
"and we really actually
need to get to work."

01:19.218 --> 01:21.216
Two criminals could see
us in the car and think,

01:21.217 --> 01:24.496
"Oh, look, there's two cops just
sitting there on a stake-out."

01:24.497 --> 01:27.488
"But, hang on, no. Because
there's a dolphin in the back."

01:28.180 --> 01:30.511
The dolphin saves it.

01:30.536 --> 01:32.455
Yeah.

02:02.373 --> 02:04.572
Continuing Operation Big Red.

02:04.573 --> 02:08.532
Several suspect locations being
staked out throughout the city.

02:08.532 --> 02:11.211
Settle in, everyone. We're
playing the waiting game.

02:11.212 --> 02:14.171
- If you were a Siamese twin...
- Here we go.

02:14.172 --> 02:17.691
Which, uh... which hand
would you masturbate with?

02:18.087 --> 02:19.690
Whichever hand

02:20.278 --> 02:21.690
connected to my head.

02:21.691 --> 02:24.650
If I were the right head,
I'd go the right hand.

02:24.651 --> 02:27.170
Well, would you, though?
Or would it be like...

02:27.171 --> 02:29.809
If you used the other, it would
be like it was someone else.

02:29.810 --> 02:31.729
- It would be more exotic.
- Would it be?

02:31.730 --> 02:33.649
Wouldn't you have to ask
the other head's permission

02:33.650 --> 02:35.209
if you wanted to use their arm?

02:35.210 --> 02:36.769
"Would you mind jerking us off?"

02:36.770 --> 02:38.409
No, I think the other head would realise

02:38.410 --> 02:40.288
at the same time that
you had the thought.

02:40.289 --> 02:42.249
They don't share a brain.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.528
Yeah, but, like, there
would be, you know,

02:45.529 --> 02:48.088
that kind of sensation
comes from somewhere else.

02:48.089 --> 02:51.127
So probably would have been
a slight arousal downstairs.

02:51.128 --> 02:53.887
Both the heads would be
going, "Oh, it's on here."

02:53.888 --> 02:56.207
- Not necessarily.
- "Who's gonna get hold of this?"

02:56.208 --> 02:58.847
- It'd be a race.
- Yeah.

02:58.848 --> 03:01.126
Car 72, please report.

03:01.127 --> 03:02.966
- Speak up a bit.
- Speak? Um...

03:02.967 --> 03:06.046
Car 72, please report.

03:07.807 --> 03:11.165
Uh, this is Car 72. No
activity. Who's that?

03:11.166 --> 03:14.645
This is April. I'm in
Dispatch with Carol.

03:14.646 --> 03:16.485
It's her first day, guys.

03:16.486 --> 03:18.925
Oh. April. Well, welcome.

03:18.926 --> 03:21.004
This is, uh, Detective Hendy.

03:21.005 --> 03:24.124
Uh, Detective Stokes.
Welcome aboard, April.

03:24.125 --> 03:27.204
Maintaining surveillance on
seemingly empty warehouse.

03:27.205 --> 03:29.244
We are Car 72 and look forward to

03:29.245 --> 03:31.243
checking in with you in the future.

03:31.244 --> 03:33.523
- Should we do it?
- Mmm.

03:33.524 --> 03:36.763
Actually, April, stand by.
There is a bit of activity.

03:36.764 --> 03:40.402
- Oh, no. He's...
- What?

03:40.403 --> 03:42.362
Sorry?

03:42.363 --> 03:45.242
- Sorry, Car 72. What?
- Backup! Backup!

03:45.243 --> 03:47.562
Sorry, I'm not quite catching
you. Are you... Car 72?

03:47.563 --> 03:50.041
Carol?

03:50.042 --> 03:52.321
Um... Car 72?

03:52.322 --> 03:54.601
Car 72, please grow up.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.721
- Sorry. Sorry, Carol.
- Sorry, Carol.

03:56.722 --> 04:00.360
- Sorry, April.
- Fuck's sake.

04:00.947 --> 04:03.010
She sounds nice, doesn't she, huh?

04:03.550 --> 04:05.720
- No. No.
- Come on.

04:05.721 --> 04:07.280
- I could...
- No, you can't.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.879
You think you're some kind
of Cupid and you're not.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.359
- I won't be set up by you again.
- Oh, come on.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.679
And I don't want a nice April.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.439
I want a filthy April.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.358
- Hmm.
- Is what I want.

04:18.360 --> 04:21.478
I want, like, a, you know,
come home at 3am after a shift

04:21.478 --> 04:24.198
and just go, "I don't
care if you're asleep."

04:24.199 --> 04:27.318
I wanna like her. I want her hot.

04:27.319 --> 04:29.477
Fecund. Like a Parisian.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.582
With a bit of medieval...

04:32.607 --> 04:35.157
Like a hot summer. Like, I'm sweating.

04:35.158 --> 04:38.477
I don't know what fluids are
coming out of here. Oh, yeah.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.836
- You wanna throw your fluid...
- Yeah.

04:43.397 --> 04:45.796
- The... Hmm?
- Car 72.

04:45.797 --> 04:47.636
You're still on.

04:48.504 --> 04:50.755
Uh... Yeah, sorry, Carol.

04:50.756 --> 04:52.355
Just, uh...

04:52.356 --> 04:54.235
Uh, just kidding.

04:54.236 --> 04:56.315
Car 72 out.

04:56.774 --> 04:57.875
You fuckhead.

04:57.876 --> 04:59.914
- I had it resting on my thigh.
- Did you?

04:59.915 --> 05:01.794
I just... It's the way I hold the radio.

05:01.795 --> 05:04.929
- Gimme... That's no more radio for you
- Just... I am sorry

05:06.235 --> 05:07.715
She might have liked it.

05:09.075 --> 05:11.073
Everyone is someone's type.

05:11.074 --> 05:13.153
Oh, fu-u-u-uckin'
shut up.

05:13.154 --> 05:14.793
Uh, Customs has uncovered

05:14.794 --> 05:16.593
a small amount of methamphetamines

05:16.594 --> 05:18.873
encased in coffee beans out of Colombia.

05:18.874 --> 05:21.232
We've got several warehouses
under surveillance.

05:21.233 --> 05:24.633
Uh, we're hoping the boys are
taking the drop at one of them.

05:36.152 --> 05:37.911
Hey.

05:37.912 --> 05:41.030
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

05:41.031 --> 05:42.630
Shut up.

05:42.631 --> 05:46.470
You know, one thing I
can't abide is treachery.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.310
- I know. I know.
- I don't know...

05:48.311 --> 05:49.789
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:49.790 --> 05:51.567
- I'm your friend.
- Really?

05:51.920 --> 05:53.717
For on the seventh day,

05:53.742 --> 05:55.629
he did rest.

05:56.330 --> 05:58.468
I do not.

06:00.768 --> 06:01.988
How's that?

06:02.635 --> 06:04.987
- Mate, that was very good.
- It's intense, isn't it?

06:04.989 --> 06:07.268
Mate, I love the biblical slant.

06:07.269 --> 06:08.908
I mean, what's the... The speech making.

06:08.909 --> 06:10.547
Yeah, Janine's been
helping me with that.

06:10.548 --> 06:13.467
- Like an evil pastor.
- Yeah. "Pastor"?

06:13.468 --> 06:15.347
- Like a preacher.
- Oh, okay.

06:15.348 --> 06:17.427
- But, like, evil.
- Oh, evil. Definitely evil.

06:17.428 --> 06:19.266
It's a kind of weird sermon.

06:19.267 --> 06:20.986
If it's not evil, it's not worth doin'.

06:20.987 --> 06:22.986
I like the way you use
your face, you know.

06:22.987 --> 06:24.866
You got a head what's a bit caved in.

06:24.867 --> 06:27.186
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So you use just the stillness.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.986
- Yeah.
- And the voice.

06:28.987 --> 06:31.145
What about you? How are
you working these days?

06:31.146 --> 06:32.985
I'm gonna go the kind of more of your...

06:32.986 --> 06:35.545
the Mel Gibson kind of crazy-eye thing.

06:35.546 --> 06:37.585
- You know, kind of, you know...
- Have a crack.

06:37.586 --> 06:40.144
Nah, mate, I'll just... use the ol' BIC.

06:40.145 --> 06:41.864
Okay.

06:43.198 --> 06:46.264
Hey!

06:46.265 --> 06:48.730
Don't look at me.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.903
Hey, man. I don't know what you're...

06:50.904 --> 06:53.183
Nah, mate. Nah, mate. Nah, mate.

06:53.184 --> 06:54.983
Don't look at me. Look at me.

06:54.984 --> 06:58.246
Don't look at me. Look at me.

06:58.271 --> 06:59.702
Jesus, look at the eye.

06:59.703 --> 07:01.422
You like that?

07:01.423 --> 07:03.622
- Shit, man.
- Hey, you killed me brother.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.742
- Yeah, I...
- No, no, no.

07:05.743 --> 07:07.302
- You killed me sister.
- Yeah.

07:07.303 --> 07:09.581
You killed me mother's uncle

07:09.582 --> 07:11.421
and now I'm gonna kill you.

07:11.422 --> 07:13.062
Argh!

07:14.142 --> 07:16.581
- That's bent.
- Well...

07:16.582 --> 07:18.061
- That's bent.
- I'm crazy, mate.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.020
You don't know which way I'll
go. Am I gonna do it? Am I not?

07:21.021 --> 07:23.780
- Look at me, don't look at me.
- I got confused. I didn't know...

07:23.781 --> 07:25.860
Oh, mate. I'm just
as confused as anyone.

07:25.861 --> 07:27.660
If I didn't know you,

07:27.661 --> 07:31.219
I'd think... mentally retarded.

07:31.220 --> 07:33.419
- Yeah.
- I gotta take a piss.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.819
Oh, mate.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.899
Can't you go out of
the... in the laneway?

07:37.900 --> 07:39.698
The job is we wait here

07:39.699 --> 07:42.178
until we're told different, all right?

07:47.806 --> 07:49.884
Ah, attempted assault.

07:49.885 --> 07:52.684
Okay, attempted assault could be just,

07:52.684 --> 07:54.203
"What are you looking at?"

07:54.204 --> 07:56.164
- Unmanned crossing.
- Yeah.

07:56.189 --> 07:58.754
That's got... That
could be kids, you know.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.214
Uh, you... you've really
gotta learn to prioritise.

08:01.239 --> 08:02.458
- Okay.
- Think about it.

08:02.483 --> 08:04.633
- Patting a police horse.
- Yep.

08:04.658 --> 08:08.341
Or a noise complaint at 9:45pm?

08:08.366 --> 08:11.133
Uh, the noise complaint at 9:45?

08:11.158 --> 08:14.121
- 9:45?
- Perhaps?

08:14.122 --> 08:16.821
Assaulting a police horse

08:16.846 --> 08:19.099
- is assaulting a member of the police
- Yeah.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.814
- force.
- Force.

08:20.839 --> 08:22.339
- Yeah.
- I think that's pretty im...

08:22.364 --> 08:23.925
And you know, you wouldn't
like it if someone...

08:23.950 --> 08:26.172
- No.
- Do you like that? Would you like that?

08:26.197 --> 08:28.559
- No, I don't. Nup.
- Or just that?

08:28.584 --> 08:31.153
- Like a constant...
- Don't like that either. Nup.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.727
- So think about that.
- Yep. If I...

08:33.751 --> 08:35.654
Yep. If I were the horse. Okay.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.361
- It's pretty simple.
- All right.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.198
I love you.

08:41.982 --> 08:44.638
Yeah, it's all right.
You don't have to say it.

08:44.639 --> 08:45.737
'Bye.

08:47.719 --> 08:49.438
Wendy's up then.

08:49.439 --> 08:52.477
Yes. Yes. It's the black dog.

08:52.478 --> 08:54.957
- Is it?
- It's got her by the throat tonight.

08:54.958 --> 08:57.117
- Still? Still?
- Yeah. Yeah.

08:57.118 --> 08:59.557
However, I have the
key to her happiness.

08:59.558 --> 09:02.076
Which is putting her down? Euthanasia?

09:02.077 --> 09:03.756
I'm gonna give her a child.

09:03.757 --> 09:05.836
- Really? When?
- Yeah.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.916
Well, as soon as I can... I
can hit the bullseye, I guess.

09:08.917 --> 09:11.475
You'll have to get the... reversed.

09:11.476 --> 09:13.915
Which I hear can be quite
painful. Are you up for that?

09:13.916 --> 09:15.755
- And not always successful.
- What are you talking about?

09:15.756 --> 09:17.995
- Vasectomy reversal.
- Vasectomy?

09:17.996 --> 09:20.074
- I haven't had a vasectomy.
- Really?

09:20.075 --> 09:22.034
- No.
- I must have dreamt that.

09:22.035 --> 09:24.634
- I just assumed you had.
- You must have dreamt that.

09:24.635 --> 09:27.434
What makes you think that
I have had a vasectomy?

09:27.919 --> 09:29.050
I dunno.

09:29.387 --> 09:31.993
Just... Your face.

09:32.514 --> 09:34.914
What? I have a vasectomy face?

09:36.314 --> 09:37.794
A little bit.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.072
Yeah.

09:43.073 --> 09:45.192
Well, as an orphan,

09:45.193 --> 09:48.512
I just find that particular
toll an absolute rort.

09:48.513 --> 09:49.991
- "As an orphan"?
- Yeah.

09:49.992 --> 09:51.591
Does it change if you're not an orphan?

09:51.592 --> 09:53.471
Well, I am an orphan.

09:53.472 --> 09:57.151
I don't say to you,
"Not being an orphan,

09:57.152 --> 09:59.742
"I find the toll going through
the tunnel," you know...

09:59.767 --> 10:02.289
Yeah, but that's not the
point. I am an orphan.

10:02.314 --> 10:04.473
How's the, uh...

10:04.671 --> 10:06.350
How's the search going for your dad?

10:06.358 --> 10:07.957
Oh, yeah. I took a trip last weekend.

10:07.958 --> 10:09.516
Went out to Gilgandra. Out west.

10:09.517 --> 10:12.716
I found an old letter that my
mum had written that was a clue.

10:12.717 --> 10:15.596
Met the butcher and he said
he'd known her, back in the day.

10:15.597 --> 10:18.036
He brought all his brothers
out from out the back.

10:18.037 --> 10:20.715
All their faces lit up
when I spoke about her.

10:20.716 --> 10:23.115
She was kind of an
inspiration around the town.

10:23.116 --> 10:25.355
They'd all known her.
She was very vivacious.

10:25.356 --> 10:27.355
Fun-loving. Loved to dance.

10:27.356 --> 10:30.434
No, they actually
started... started bickering

10:30.435 --> 10:33.114
amongst themselves about
who'd known her the best,

10:33.115 --> 10:34.674
who'd had the most fun with her.

10:34.675 --> 10:38.034
Anyway, they pointed me in
the direction of, uh, Old Vic.

10:38.035 --> 10:40.673
Yeah, yeah, he was the
president of the leagues club.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.433
And he said he'd been out with her.

10:42.434 --> 10:45.369
Said she was just always on the go.

10:45.908 --> 10:47.593
Perpetual motion machine.

10:47.594 --> 10:50.032
She loved to get around the town.

10:50.033 --> 10:51.832
Vic said she was always good company.

10:51.833 --> 10:55.072
He said he could call her up
at the drop of a hat, you know.

10:55.073 --> 10:57.112
Tuesday night. "What
are you doing, Maureen?"

10:57.113 --> 10:59.032
"Yeah, I'll come round. I'll come over."

10:59.033 --> 11:00.671
Anyway, yeah, it was great trip.

11:00.672 --> 11:02.551
- Met some lovely old blokes.
- Yeah.

11:02.552 --> 11:04.551
Heard some great stories
about my dear old mum.

11:04.552 --> 11:06.231
How many swabs did you take out there?

11:06.232 --> 11:08.151
- I got eight tests.
- Right.

11:08.152 --> 11:10.870
- The DNA tests.
- How many you done so far?

11:10.871 --> 11:12.585
67.

11:13.151 --> 11:15.310
That's the frustrating
thing is, you know...

11:15.311 --> 11:16.870
I'm following up all these leads

11:16.871 --> 11:19.030
and they've all known
her very, very well,

11:19.031 --> 11:21.309
so it could have been any one of them.

11:22.317 --> 11:25.150
Any one of the 67?

11:25.150 --> 11:26.789
We've got a large shipment

11:26.790 --> 11:29.388
from the same location as
the original coffee export.

11:29.389 --> 11:33.708
And this is a big haul.
It's in excess of 3.8 tonnes.

11:33.709 --> 11:36.588
We're going over the
download limit every month.

11:36.589 --> 11:39.028
You should be in bed
anyway. Just go to bed.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.188
Speak to you in the morning. 'Bye.

11:44.708 --> 11:46.627
- Sorry about that.
- Was that your...

11:46.628 --> 11:49.067
Like, your boyfriend or your husband?

11:49.068 --> 11:52.386
- No. No, it's my son.
- Ah.

11:52.387 --> 11:54.146
- Lachy.
- That makes more sense.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.306
He's 15. He's just...

11:56.307 --> 11:58.506
Well, he's a
15-year-old boy.

11:58.507 --> 12:00.425
You know. Who uses my laptop.

12:00.426 --> 12:03.065
A bit too much.

12:03.066 --> 12:06.665
He's just always disappearing
into the bathroom.

12:07.033 --> 12:08.505
With my laptop.

12:08.787 --> 12:12.024
I know what he's doing in
there. You know what he's doing.

12:12.025 --> 12:14.904
- Uh, I mean, I...
- You know what he's doing.

12:14.905 --> 12:17.224
It's not... I don't
know... I don't know Lachy.

12:17.225 --> 12:18.984
- It's not fair for me to...
- You know...

12:18.985 --> 12:20.543
- Okay.
- What he's doing in there.

12:20.544 --> 12:22.703
- Yep. Yep.
- Right.

12:22.704 --> 12:24.183
- And it's my laptop.
- Yep.

12:24.184 --> 12:26.783
It's not even the fact that
when he comes out, it...

12:26.784 --> 12:29.542
- Stuff on the screen.
- Yeah.

12:29.543 --> 12:31.422
He's tried to wipe it
off with toilet paper,

12:31.423 --> 12:33.662
and it's all got stuck
in the keys and I'm...

12:33.663 --> 12:35.662
It's not even that. I'm not a prude.

12:35.663 --> 12:37.622
It's the fact that I'm worried

12:37.623 --> 12:39.781
that this is stifling his imagination.

12:39.782 --> 12:44.181
And, you know, once your
imagination goes, that's it.

12:44.182 --> 12:46.021
- It's gone.
- Probably.

12:46.022 --> 12:48.141
You cannot get that back. I just...

12:48.142 --> 12:49.780
You know, a couple of times,

12:49.781 --> 12:51.820
I've gone up to the
door when he's in there,

12:51.821 --> 12:53.700
and I'm just, you know, I'm saying,

12:53.701 --> 12:56.420
"Use your imagination,
mate. Use your..."

12:56.421 --> 12:58.740
You know, "Think of
Sarah Curtis in Year 11."

12:58.741 --> 13:01.539
"You know, the wing
attack. The wing attack."

13:01.540 --> 13:04.139
And he's just... He's going,
"Go away, Mum. Go away."

13:04.140 --> 13:07.619
But I'm trying to... make
him be the best he can be.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.378
For instance, if he came
in here and he met you...

13:11.379 --> 13:13.418
- Me? Oh, yeah.
- Right. He would...

13:13.419 --> 13:15.778
He would just be, you
know, think you were tops.

13:15.779 --> 13:19.298
And then if he went away,
right, and he went back home

13:19.299 --> 13:21.937
to the bathroom with an image of you.

13:21.938 --> 13:23.110
Your lips.

13:23.142 --> 13:25.141
Like, say, he's... he's got

13:25.142 --> 13:27.021
your lips in his mind.

13:27.022 --> 13:29.260
- Yeah.
- And then he takes that back.

13:29.261 --> 13:31.300
- You know, be just imagining...
- Could be anyone's though.

13:31.301 --> 13:33.820
No, it'd be your lips that
he'd be, like, imagining.

13:33.821 --> 13:36.180
That is healthy.

13:36.181 --> 13:38.660
What he's doing...

13:38.661 --> 13:42.059
I just... I despair, you know.

13:42.060 --> 13:44.219
I think you're not alone there, Carol.

13:44.220 --> 13:46.059
I think there's a
whole wave of young boys

13:46.060 --> 13:48.299
going through puberty, turning into men

13:48.300 --> 13:50.898
who think that finishing
on a woman's face

13:50.923 --> 13:53.529
is the normal way to end lovemaking.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.538
Sorry, "finishing"? What?

13:56.539 --> 14:00.377
Um, because they see so
many cumshots in pornography.

14:00.378 --> 14:03.288
- They... It's absolutely...
- Okay.

14:03.313 --> 14:05.765
I don't know how we got there,

14:06.393 --> 14:08.257
but I'm pretty sure that that is a topic

14:08.258 --> 14:11.536
that is not appropriate to
talk about in the workplace.

14:12.697 --> 14:15.056
Completely. Sorry, Carol.

14:15.057 --> 14:17.256
Car 72, please report.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.336
Car 72.

14:19.337 --> 14:22.136
Car 72. No activity.

14:28.336 --> 14:31.463
This amazing thing happened
to me the other day.

14:31.488 --> 14:32.640
Mmm.

14:33.432 --> 14:35.992
Have you ever seen a
dog get hit by a car?

14:37.392 --> 14:39.470
Is this the amazing thing
or is this a separate...?

14:39.471 --> 14:41.190
- No, this is it.
- Okay. No.

14:41.191 --> 14:43.390
- Have you seen one get hit?
- Nup.

14:43.391 --> 14:45.950
Heard the noise they make?

14:45.951 --> 14:48.630
I was walking past that as
it happened the other day,

14:48.631 --> 14:51.229
and this dog was...

14:51.230 --> 14:54.961
Bang! A bit of stuff shot out its back.

14:54.985 --> 14:57.344
- Oh. come on. What?
- Yeah, that's what happens.

14:57.345 --> 14:59.863
Like a bum gun kind of
experience for the dog.

14:59.864 --> 15:01.423
But there was this old man

15:01.424 --> 15:03.023
just across the road who was grieving.

15:03.024 --> 15:04.543
You know, obviously his dog.

15:04.544 --> 15:06.983
So I picked the dog up and
I've gone over to him...

15:06.984 --> 15:08.463
- Did you?
- Yeah.

15:08.464 --> 15:10.462
All right. Why? Oh,
you've just been to church.

15:10.463 --> 15:13.982
He was like... Oh, there was
tears rolling down his face.

15:13.983 --> 15:16.142
I thought, "The least I
can do is help bury it."

15:16.143 --> 15:17.662
And, anyway, so halfway through...

15:17.663 --> 15:20.461
It was very hot. It was a
hot day. I had my shirt off.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.461
And I was just kind
of picking away and...

15:22.462 --> 15:25.701
What? You were just digging
a hole with your shirt off?

15:25.702 --> 15:28.181
With an old man and a dead dog? Okay.

15:28.182 --> 15:29.980
We buried it. We said a little prayer.

15:29.981 --> 15:32.220
I had some in my mind,
having just been to the...

15:32.221 --> 15:36.340
You know, my... my weekly cleanse.

15:36.341 --> 15:37.820
- Yeah.
- And, uh...

15:37.821 --> 15:40.339
Then he was still in
such a state so I said,

15:40.340 --> 15:44.059
"What can I do for you? Can
I make you a strong drink?"

15:44.060 --> 15:48.019
"Or a cup of chai or
whatever the elderly have?"

15:48.020 --> 15:51.898
And he said, "Well,
when I feel like this,"

15:51.899 --> 15:53.898
"when I'm in grief,"

15:53.899 --> 15:56.298
"I sometimes... I like a tub."

15:56.991 --> 15:58.778
Tub of what?

15:59.261 --> 16:01.577
Like, a, you know, a hot tub.

16:01.578 --> 16:04.097
- You mean a spa bath?
- Yeah.

16:04.098 --> 16:06.057
- A hot tub?
- A jacuzzi. Whatever.

16:06.058 --> 16:07.617
Right.

16:07.618 --> 16:10.456
So there we were, we
were in the tub, right.

16:10.457 --> 16:12.656
- And then...
- Hang on. Hang on.

16:12.657 --> 16:14.176
- You were in the tub?
- Mmm.

16:14.177 --> 16:15.976
- With him.
- Yeah.

16:15.977 --> 16:18.936
Just you and an old
man having a hot tub.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.895
- I had my undies on.
- Okay.

16:21.896 --> 16:25.375
When did your pants come off?
I still had you in your pants.

16:25.376 --> 16:27.415
Why would I... why
would I get my pants wet?

16:27.416 --> 16:29.574
- They were my church pants.
- Mmm.

16:29.575 --> 16:31.774
Would you hop in a
jacuzzi with pants on?

16:31.775 --> 16:34.054
- Not with an old man. No.
- Well...

16:34.055 --> 16:35.534
- So...
- So...

16:35.535 --> 16:38.014
- Can I finish the story?
- I wish you would.

16:38.015 --> 16:39.893
So then something really weird happened.

16:39.894 --> 16:42.573
Oh, THEN "something
really weird happened".

16:43.310 --> 16:45.533
From under the water, right,

16:45.534 --> 16:47.453
I feel this movement.

16:47.454 --> 16:50.972
You know, like, the
sensory feeling of movement

16:50.973 --> 16:52.692
of water coming towards me.

16:52.693 --> 16:54.332
So his hand is moving.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.812
It's, like, Gollum-like
through the water.

16:56.813 --> 16:58.452
Translucent in form.

16:58.453 --> 17:01.211
And then he just
rested it ever so gently

17:01.212 --> 17:02.731
on my upper thigh.

17:02.732 --> 17:05.211
And his... like, I can
just feel his old nails

17:05.212 --> 17:08.012
just... just digging in a little there.

17:10.661 --> 17:12.771
And then I looked up...

17:14.335 --> 17:16.615
and he was no longer grieving.

17:18.050 --> 17:21.930
He had a... just a
slight smile on his face.

17:25.770 --> 17:27.210
So then I just...

17:29.090 --> 17:31.168
gently removed his hand.

17:32.077 --> 17:33.320
And that was that.

17:39.527 --> 17:42.233
I don't think you should
tell anyone else that story.

17:42.258 --> 17:44.897
- No?
- Nup. Nup.

17:45.110 --> 17:48.549
Intelligence indicates the drug shipment

17:48.550 --> 17:51.308
may have links to an
international drug syndicate.

17:51.309 --> 17:53.388
Operation Big Red just got bigger.

17:57.749 --> 18:00.187
Have I ever told you this one?

18:00.188 --> 18:03.067
- How I pissed on his head?
- No, go ahead.

18:03.068 --> 18:06.147
Well, you know, we're
sitting around the fire.

18:06.148 --> 18:08.467
I mean, we're pretty pissed, you know.

18:08.468 --> 18:10.266
He couldn't stand her snoring.

18:10.267 --> 18:12.346
So we've been to
Melbourne Cup, you know.

18:12.347 --> 18:16.586
Um, oh, a couple of days before
and I've lost me shoe. Weird.

18:16.587 --> 18:19.346
So he's dragging me out
of their tent, right.

18:19.347 --> 18:22.145
I just needed a piss. I mean,
what else was I gonna do?

18:22.146 --> 18:24.505
I'm thinking, "I'm inside
the tent," you know?

18:27.300 --> 18:30.224
Mango. I was with Mango Baxter. Camping.

18:30.225 --> 18:32.504
It is a fine art

18:32.505 --> 18:34.196
the way that you can butcher the story.

18:34.229 --> 18:36.668
I mean, you've got no respect
for three-act structure.

18:36.669 --> 18:38.628
I mean, there's no
beginning, middle or end.

18:38.629 --> 18:40.547
You told me you'd pissed on him,

18:40.548 --> 18:43.307
which was the punchline,
at the beginning.

18:43.308 --> 18:46.467
Why are you in Melbourne,
Melbourne Cup, with no shoe?

18:46.468 --> 18:48.907
- Yeah, I told you about that.
- I didn't know you were camping.

18:48.908 --> 18:50.866
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Mr Shakespeare.

18:50.867 --> 18:54.306
I didn't realise I had to have
a third degree to tell a story.

18:54.966 --> 18:56.305
I just... Mate, I couldn't und...

18:56.307 --> 18:58.546
I couldn't understand
head nor tail of it.

18:58.547 --> 19:00.025
- Really?
- Kind of blows my mind.

19:00.026 --> 19:01.865
Why don't you tell it?
Come on, smart arse.

19:01.866 --> 19:03.345
- You tell it.
- No.

19:03.346 --> 19:05.225
No, no. You're such a great storyteller.

19:05.226 --> 19:07.145
William Tell or Shakespeare
or whoever you are.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.264
Why don't you tell it?

19:09.265 --> 19:11.464
All right. All right.

19:11.465 --> 19:13.304
So me... me and Mango.

19:13.305 --> 19:15.424
We've gone camping up the Dandenongs.

19:15.425 --> 19:17.024
- This was a couple of weeks ago.
- Yeah.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.743
It was a beautiful starry
night, balmy weather.

19:19.744 --> 19:22.423
We pitched the tent, lit a fire.

19:22.424 --> 19:24.343
We've got a bottle of Jim Beam.

19:24.344 --> 19:26.223
I think it's time
for a bit of shut-eye.

19:26.224 --> 19:30.582
So I unzip the tent, fold back
the flies and get in there,

19:30.583 --> 19:33.142
hop in my sleeping bag
for a good night of Z's.

19:33.749 --> 19:36.382
And you know me. I snore like a sailor.

19:36.383 --> 19:39.221
And Mango, he wants
to go to bed as well.

19:39.222 --> 19:41.981
So he gets into the tent,
but he can't get to sleep

19:41.982 --> 19:44.461
because of my snoring,
and you know what I'm like.

19:44.462 --> 19:46.821
So he drags me just out of the tent,

19:46.822 --> 19:49.900
puts a pillow under my head and
just leaves me to sleep it off

19:50.257 --> 19:52.696
under the stars, near the fire.

19:52.697 --> 19:55.976
And me, I'm a bit pissed. I get
up in the middle of the night.

19:55.976 --> 19:57.975
I need to take... need to take a leak.

19:57.976 --> 20:00.854
So I think I'm still inside the tent.

20:00.855 --> 20:04.214
So I unzip it and take a piss

20:04.215 --> 20:07.414
into what I think is
Mother Nature's glory.

20:07.415 --> 20:10.573
And I piss straight onto
Mango Baxter's sleeping bag

20:10.574 --> 20:12.253
and all over his face.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.173
Jeez, he had the shits.

20:16.574 --> 20:19.652
- Same thing happened to me.
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:19.653 --> 20:22.212
Except we'd been to Melbourne
Cup a couple of days before.

20:22.213 --> 20:23.692
Yeah, right.

20:23.693 --> 20:25.812
Mate, my prostate. I gotta go again.

20:25.813 --> 20:27.812
Don't do it in the bucket, Brucey.

20:27.813 --> 20:29.651
- Don't do it in the bucket.
- Come on, mate.

20:29.652 --> 20:32.131
- Do it out in the laneway.
- Oh!

20:32.132 --> 20:34.411
- Come on.
- Fine.

20:34.412 --> 20:36.651
This is Car 72. We have activity.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.691
Ah. Car 72. Go ahead.

20:38.692 --> 20:41.010
We have activity, suspicious male

20:41.011 --> 20:43.290
observed loitering
outside target location.

20:43.291 --> 20:47.090
Stand by while Detective Stokes
conducts further investigation.

20:47.091 --> 20:49.889
- Why me?
- Off you go.

20:49.890 --> 20:51.689
Well, I don't wanna bother him.

20:51.690 --> 20:54.129
Yes, you do. Look, he's doing a wee now.

20:54.130 --> 20:56.609
- Oh.
- Look, that's a crime in itself.

20:56.626 --> 20:58.585
- Go and reprimand him.
- Who hasn't done that?

20:58.586 --> 21:00.504
Just go and... I
stopped for the dolphin.

21:00.505 --> 21:03.104
- Go and talk to him.
- All right.

21:03.105 --> 21:04.584
- Thank you.
- Jesus.

21:04.585 --> 21:06.064
Thanks for doing me this favour.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.104
- Get off me back.
- Have you got your badge?

21:08.105 --> 21:10.263
- It's in my jacket.
- Put your jacket on.

21:10.264 --> 21:13.183
- It's hot.
- You're representing the police force.

21:13.184 --> 21:15.103
Just put it on.

21:15.104 --> 21:17.312
- Got your gun?
- It's in the back somewhere.

21:17.337 --> 21:19.017
Where? Oh, here it is. Cup holder.

21:20.263 --> 21:23.222
Jesus wept.

21:23.223 --> 21:26.302
Excuse me, buddy. Yeah, g'day,
mate. How are you? Sorry.

21:26.303 --> 21:28.862
No, don't wave at him.
He's not your mate.

21:28.863 --> 21:31.101
You shouldn't be taking
a piss on the wall there.

21:31.102 --> 21:35.341
"Hello, friend. I'm Detective
Stokes. Do you like dolphins?"

21:35.342 --> 21:38.501
I'm on a fucking smoko break,
all right. Mind your own business.

21:38.502 --> 21:41.300
- Jesus.
- Look, I really must insist...

21:41.301 --> 21:43.420
that you don't take a...

21:43.421 --> 21:45.861
Gun! Gun! Gun!
