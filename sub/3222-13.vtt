00:07.374 --> 00:08.966
Bobby! Bobby!

00:09.576 --> 00:12.340
Gunshot wound to the right
frontal area, no exit wound found.

00:13.113 --> 00:14.842
Hello, Mr. Singer.

00:15.582 --> 00:16.640
Your time's up.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.544
Idiots.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.255
Bobby?

00:27.494 --> 00:28.586
Hey!

00:29.196 --> 00:32.097
What's it gonna be? Stay or go?

00:32.299 --> 00:35.234
- You lied. You killed my friend.
- Killing Amy was not wrong.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.897
You couldn't do it, so I did.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.972
I don't know why I'm doing much
of anything anymore.

00:41.141 --> 00:43.575
Here's my advice you didn't ask for.
Quit.

00:43.744 --> 00:47.145
What? It's not even an option.
Not gonna walk out on my brother.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.674
Do what I did. Decide to be fine
till the end of the week.

00:50.884 --> 00:55.651
Make yourself smile
because you're alive and that's your job.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.347
Then do it again the next week.

00:57.524 --> 01:02.689
Do it right, with a smile,
or don't do it.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.049
Barb, that you?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.110
Good morning.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.612
Hey.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.549
Is that Bobby's?

03:13.727 --> 03:18.130
- Heh. I didn't know you kept that.
- Yeah. Mine sprung a leak, ahem.

03:18.298 --> 03:22.758
You know, most people would just carry,
uh, a photo or something for a memento.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.737
Shut up, man. I'm honoring the guy.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.134
All right?

03:27.307 --> 03:30.765
This is, uh, grief therapy. Kind of
like you and your wild goose chase.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.502
- Wild goose chase?
- Yeah.

03:32.679 --> 03:36.171
Four guys murdered in two weeks.
Hands and feet cut off.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.250
Yeah, well, some guy with a foot fetish
run amok.

03:38.418 --> 03:41.581
Grown men thrown so hard
they went through walls.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.850
Ugh, did you even read the article?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.424
No, I was napping.

03:47.594 --> 03:51.030
Well, what else you got going on?
Dick Roman's a dead end for now.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.859
- We might as well stay...
- Stay busy.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.557
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

04:00.874 --> 04:04.071
The latest, but probably not the last.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.375
You always work this late?

04:08.548 --> 04:11.517
Ugh. Hours suck, yeah,
but great benefits package.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.845
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.511
- Ten percent co-pay on all drugs.
- Seriously?

04:15.689 --> 04:17.384
- Just generic?
- No, name brands are cool.

04:17.557 --> 04:18.922
- Huh.
- Yeah.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.060
So, uh, what's our boy here weigh?

04:21.228 --> 04:24.823
Uh, a buck 90. Thrown against the wall
so hard it buckled.

04:24.998 --> 04:28.832
Based on the blood at the scene, hands
and feet were cut off while he was alive.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.833
The killer wanted him to suffer.

04:31.004 --> 04:34.906
And all vics are male, right?
With the, uh, same kind of artwork as this?

04:35.108 --> 04:36.575
Yeah. Identical.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.904
So, uh, DNA left at any of the scenes?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.910
All of them.
One before this, the guy bit the attacker.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.049
Still had a chunk of flesh in his teeth.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.912
- That's as good as it gets.
- Right.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.984
- So we have a match?
- We do not.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.715
Samples were rejected. Genetic markers
don't match anything we've seen.

04:52.893 --> 04:57.227
- Didn't match any person in the database?
- No. They don't match anything human.

04:58.765 --> 04:59.823
Hmm.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.869
I'll admit, it could be in the general
vicinity of the ballpark of our thing.

05:05.038 --> 05:09.498
Yeah. Uh, "Didn't match anything human"
usually seals the deal for me.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.337
Uh, I've never seen this symbol before.

05:11.511 --> 05:13.945
Let's go back to the motel,
haul out the laptop.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.411
That's a great idea.
Actually, a brilliant idea.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.882
Here's my counter. You do that...

05:19.052 --> 05:21.520
...I'll go undercover,
mingle amongst the locals...

05:21.688 --> 05:23.952
...see what kind of clues
bubble to the surface.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.556
You're going to a bar.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.285
Wow.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.726
If you wanna oversimplify it.

05:37.971 --> 05:42.067
Um, heh, dinner and a movie,
which sounded fine...

05:42.242 --> 05:44.574
<i>...except the movie
was Human Centipede.</i>

05:46.379 --> 05:48.244
Well, so wait, uh,
you had a problem with that?

05:48.415 --> 05:49.780
The date from hell.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.245
Dating, right? Ugh.

05:52.419 --> 05:53.943
But what's the option?

05:54.121 --> 05:56.089
I don't see settling down
any time soon.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.651
That's something you don't hear
every day.

06:00.827 --> 06:04.228
Heh. What, are you ready
for the big commit?

06:04.397 --> 06:06.297
Me?

06:07.667 --> 06:08.691
Not exactly.

06:12.739 --> 06:13.831
Nice suit, by the way.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.569
Guys don't dress up much.

06:16.743 --> 06:18.836
- I like it.
- Yeah, well...

06:19.012 --> 06:21.310
...it's a conservative line of work.

06:21.481 --> 06:22.778
What line is that?

06:23.350 --> 06:25.250
- Investment banking.
- Oh, God.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.579
- Thanks.
- I hear the hours are ridic.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.814
- Yeah.
- But there's money to be made.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.730
I've had a fortunate year.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.525
Well...

06:44.638 --> 06:46.128
...may you have many more.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.668
- Heh. You speak Japanese?
- Enough to get by.

06:54.381 --> 06:55.973
Well...

06:56.550 --> 06:59.747
...look at you.
Yeah, look at me.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.190
So...

07:05.759 --> 07:08.023
You wanna move this conversation
elsewhere?

07:32.219 --> 07:33.345
Hi.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.578
What can I do for you?

08:31.611 --> 08:34.705
- You look like crap.
- Yeah, well, I feel worse than I look.

08:34.881 --> 08:37.748
I do recommend the Cobalt Room,
by the way. Awesome night.

08:37.917 --> 08:40.317
Although, I think
I'm getting too old for this. Heh.

08:40.486 --> 08:43.547
- Did you, uh, figure out that symbol?
- No. Um...

08:43.722 --> 08:46.123
- We're gonna need an expert.
- Expert?

08:46.293 --> 08:48.158
Our expert's dead.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.362
All right.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.499
Comes off the wall down here.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.262
Thanks.

08:58.438 --> 09:01.464
Hmm. Nice decor.
Very early slaughterhouse.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.238
FBI.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.403
Guys, this is Charlene Penn.
She's the lead on the case.

09:07.580 --> 09:09.138
More of the same. Uh...

09:09.316 --> 09:11.784
No forced entry,
thrown across the room.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.418
Made to suffer.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.781
Both hands and feet cut off.

09:16.523 --> 09:17.649
Same symbol on the chest.

09:17.824 --> 09:21.282
Hmm. Whoever the killer is,
the guy's a monster.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.122
Excuse me.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.998
This guy just like the last one.
Uh, early 30s, decent-looking.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.600
Yeah. Uh, just like the first three.

09:28.768 --> 09:31.134
You know, fairly successful,
no known enemies.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.135
- Hmm.
- Here.

09:36.476 --> 09:37.704
Excuse me.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.037
I got it.

09:40.313 --> 09:41.644
How can I help you?

09:41.815 --> 09:45.546
I was just trying to find out
what happened. Jerry was a friend.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.119
I'm sorry.
Jerry was killed sometime last night.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.656
You live nearby?

09:50.824 --> 09:51.984
Yeah. Two doors down.

09:53.860 --> 09:57.125
You, uh... You know anyone
who would wanna harm Jerry?

09:57.297 --> 09:59.857
No. He's the nicest guy in the world.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.658
Well, his...
His wife wasn't real happy with him.

10:02.836 --> 10:03.894
Why's that?

10:04.070 --> 10:06.664
A few nights ago,
he has a little one-night fling.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.706
Ann found out, took off.

10:09.876 --> 10:12.811
But she would never do
anything like...

10:12.979 --> 10:14.469
Yeah, of course.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.538
Thanks.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.981
- Who was that?
- Neighbor.

10:22.155 --> 10:25.420
- Vic's wife caught him cheating.
- We're not thinking it's the wife.

10:25.592 --> 10:28.584
Not unless she benches 350
and did the other guys as a warm-up.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.662
Shoot.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.355
I left Bobby's flask over at Lydia's.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.661
- Lydia?
- My workout partner from last night.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.269
Now I've gotta go get it.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.031
Not only do you know her name,
you're gonna call her.

10:41.207 --> 10:42.606
Bite me.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.210
How sweet, she gave you her number.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.604
They always give you their number.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.587
<i>- Hello?
- Lydia.</i>

10:55.755 --> 10:58.349
Hey, it's, uh, Dean. From last night.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.152
Uh-huh.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.226
Uh, listen, I think I left something
over at your place.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.295
It was an old flask. Um...

11:04.497 --> 11:06.556
Doesn't look like much,
but it has sentimental value.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.860
So, uh, have you seen it?

11:09.402 --> 11:10.630
No.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.101
But if I do, I'll call.

11:13.306 --> 11:16.104
- You want my number?
- My cell grabbed it. Uh...

11:17.076 --> 11:18.873
Sorry, I gotta go.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.444
<i>Just real busy at the moment.</i>

11:20.613 --> 11:21.637
Oh.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.212
She's real busy.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.330
Breathe.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.138
- Agh!
- Control, Lydia.

11:51.678 --> 11:52.906
As in all things.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.108
One final push.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.543
- Aah!
- The pain is an honor.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.091
What will we call her?

12:17.170 --> 12:19.297
You will call her Emma.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.568
Next.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.670
Fascinating.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.177
Truly.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.613
And, actually,
rather accomplished draftsmanship.

12:31.784 --> 12:35.515
Yeah, if you get past the fact
that it was carved into a guy's body.

12:35.688 --> 12:38.384
Professor Morrison,
we're hoping you can tell us...

12:38.591 --> 12:41.492
...what the symbol means.
Uh, maybe.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.353
Maybe?

12:44.531 --> 12:46.522
It's possible I could. Even likely.

12:46.699 --> 12:50.032
Is the FBI offering
suitable remuneration?

12:54.307 --> 12:55.899
The respect of a grateful nation.

12:56.476 --> 12:59.639
And a good word with the IRS.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.183
Aah.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.521
Well, it appears quite ancient.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.622
Well, that narrows it down.

13:10.823 --> 13:14.020
A corrupted version of symbology
associated with worship.

13:14.193 --> 13:16.753
Definitely an obscure regional script.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.830
Oh, this will require some research.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.690
All right. Great.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.233
Well, uh, I guess we'll be seeing you
tomorrow.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.398
Tomorrow? Ha, ha.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.064
I've spent entire sabbaticals
on a project like this.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.039
Professor...

13:31.210 --> 13:35.271
...we have a serial killer on our hands.
Your government needs you, sir.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.542
Gentlemen...

13:38.918 --> 13:41.352
...my housekeeper needs a green card.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.756
Dear God. Where'd you find this guy?

13:47.927 --> 13:49.451
Supposed to be top in his field.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.460
When his field includes
things that go bump in the night...

13:52.665 --> 13:54.724
...he's gonna be worth the breath
we wasted.

13:54.901 --> 13:57.199
So, what are we supposed to do?
Spin our wheels?

13:57.370 --> 13:59.634
Sam, this is us spinning our wheels,
okay?

13:59.806 --> 14:02.297
Dude, you know what?
I wanna call him too, okay?

14:02.475 --> 14:04.739
Believe me. But Bobby's not here.

14:04.911 --> 14:05.969
So we're settling.

14:07.914 --> 14:09.745
Yeah. We sure are.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.579
- Damn it. Why hasn't she called?
- Who? Uh, Lydia?

14:14.921 --> 14:19.085
Heh. Wait, so some girl is actually
dumping you the morning after?

14:19.258 --> 14:21.749
You're enjoying this
a little more than you need to.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.556
Screw it. I'm going over there
and getting the flask.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.733
Don.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.264
Dean.

14:36.643 --> 14:40.272
- I guess you didn't get my messages.
- No, I did. I've been busy.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.447
Oh.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.413
Anyway, I, uh, left that flask over here
the other night.

14:45.585 --> 14:49.021
Yes. I found it.
So beat up and old I almost tossed it.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.524
Yeah. Well, the guy it belonged to
was beat up and old too...

14:52.725 --> 14:55.660
...but I was very close with him
and I'd, uh, hate to lose it.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.028
I'll get it for you.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.661
So how you been? Other than busy.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.364
Just that.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.665
Really busy. Here you go.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.705
Oh, wow.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.844
I see why you're busy.
Babysitting, huh?

15:12.011 --> 15:13.342
No.

15:14.313 --> 15:15.837
Yours?

15:16.015 --> 15:17.380
Uh-huh.

15:17.550 --> 15:20.018
You didn't tell me you had a little girl.

15:20.987 --> 15:24.354
There's probably all kinds of things
we didn't tell each other.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.450
What's her name?

15:28.061 --> 15:30.529
- Emma.
- Hi, Emma.

15:30.697 --> 15:31.789
Your first?

15:32.532 --> 15:34.124
Yes.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.133
Well, I hear they grow like weeds.

15:37.637 --> 15:38.797
You have no idea.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.907
Sorry, I gotta take this.

15:45.511 --> 15:46.842
Hello?

15:47.013 --> 15:50.073
Mm... Hey. Where are you?
It's a flask, not the Holy Grail.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.480
I'm a people person, all right?
I'm engaging in some social skills.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.746
<i>- Heh.
- You get anything out of Morrison?</i>

15:55.922 --> 15:57.822
No. Not yet.
Would you get back here?

15:57.990 --> 16:00.151
<i>- We're due at the crime lab.
- Mom, pick me up.</i>

16:00.326 --> 16:01.623
<i>- Dean?
- Hang on.</i>

16:01.794 --> 16:04.262
<i>- Why don't you just me?
- Who's that guy in the other room?</i>

16:04.430 --> 16:06.227
- Shh.
- Who is that?

16:06.399 --> 16:07.923
<i>You there?</i>

16:08.101 --> 16:10.899
Shh. Don't talk. We'll discuss it later.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.402
<i>Hello?</i>

16:13.573 --> 16:15.336
Let me call you back.

16:22.248 --> 16:25.581
So again,
we got a guy weighing about two bills...

16:25.752 --> 16:30.086
...thrown into a wall so hard he's got
pieces of plaster lodged in his skull.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.624
What triggered the fed's involvement
in this case?

16:35.728 --> 16:38.561
I always think
you boys have bigger fish to fry.

16:40.366 --> 16:43.233
- No. Actually, we...
- I just figured it was the similarity...

16:43.402 --> 16:46.860
...to other cold cases. If it's
the same killer, he crossed state lines.

16:47.039 --> 16:48.472
That would bring you guys in.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.836
Heh. Well, that's exactly right.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.705
Uh, what he said.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.942
Yeah, whatever.
You're gonna have to wrap this up.

16:57.116 --> 16:59.949
Your case isn't the only one
we're working on.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.752
You get used to her.

17:08.227 --> 17:11.663
Uh, so, Eddie, by the way,
I didn't bring the cold case files with me.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.729
- There a chance you have a copy?
- Yeah.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.265
Great.

17:20.906 --> 17:23.671
- The Cobalt Room.
- Hmm. Yeah, it's pretty well-known.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.742
Looking to hook up,
it's a pretty good place to go.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.178
- I've heard.
- Vic number two was there.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.510
According to a security guard,
he left with a hot girl.

17:32.685 --> 17:35.711
- Two days later, he's an obituary.
- Same with Jerry Price.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.413
Mm-hm. And far as I can tell,
at least a couple others in there.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.252
- Same thing in Chicago.
- Yep.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.758
Busted marriages,
flings with unknown women...

17:42.929 --> 17:45.591
...that kind of thing.
All just before they got offed.

17:47.266 --> 17:48.290
Thanks.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.323
- Is Emma ready?
- Yes. Come in.

18:12.491 --> 18:13.981
Thank you.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.272
<i>- Yeah?
- Dude.</i>

18:27.440 --> 18:29.374
<i>- You never showed.
- I'm outside Lydia's.</i>

18:29.542 --> 18:32.375
Oh, come on, man,
What are you, obsessed or something?

18:32.545 --> 18:36.311
I'm telling you, I have been eating
at the buffet of strange all afternoon.

18:36.482 --> 18:39.076
<i>- Meaning what?
- I'll tell you the second I know.</i>

18:39.252 --> 18:41.413
- Something ain't right.
- Or you're obsessed.

18:41.587 --> 18:42.815
Shut up. I'm serious.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.888
Okay, uh, you need backup or...?

18:46.058 --> 18:47.650
No, not yet.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.021
What's up on your end?

18:49.195 --> 18:52.164
There was an identical murder fest
two years ago in Chicago.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.561
And again in Miami
two years before that.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.759
<i>All the victims were young,
successful.</i>

18:56.969 --> 19:00.336
A lot of them went to the same bar,
lines up. Trails always went cold.

19:00.506 --> 19:01.700
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

19:01.874 --> 19:03.705
And by the way, as a personal kicker.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.436
Here, at least some of the vics
hooked up in that bar you went to.

19:06.612 --> 19:08.739
The, uh... The Cobalt Room.

19:08.915 --> 19:12.043
<i>So just saying, man,
you dodged a bullet.</i>

19:12.218 --> 19:13.742
Gotta go.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.477
Nice talk.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.715
Emma. Hurry up.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.258
Come on, Emma. Time to go.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.095
Emma...

19:33.272 --> 19:35.399
...you be a good girl.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.241
Make us proud.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.936
I will, Mama.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.389
Bye, Emma.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.957
I hate when this happens.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.690
Maybe she has another kid
she didn't tell you about.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.166
No, just the one. Emma.

20:38.337 --> 20:41.135
But that night, when I was with her,
she didn't have any.

20:41.307 --> 20:44.470
And I was at her place, man.
There was no playpens, no blankets...

20:44.643 --> 20:45.974
...no rubber ducks.
Right.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.806
You would've been focused on that.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.540
Hey, that's the first thing you notice.
Red flags.

20:50.716 --> 20:51.740
Pfft.

20:51.951 --> 20:56.820
- Then all of a sudden, boom, baby.
- Yeah, the one you thought talked.

20:56.989 --> 21:00.288
Oh, it talked. And not baby talk either.

21:00.459 --> 21:02.620
Now you know so much
about child development?

21:02.795 --> 21:05.662
I know enough to know they don't say,
"Hey, Mom, who's that guy?"

21:07.033 --> 21:10.127
So cut to Lydia's handing this kid,
who's calling her mommy...

21:10.302 --> 21:13.066
...over to these two women, right?
But this is not a baby.

21:13.239 --> 21:16.731
No, no.
This kid has gotta be 5. And same name.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.035
Emma.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.804
George Foreman named all his sons
George.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.315
Are you deliberately messing with me?

21:23.482 --> 21:24.972
Dude, I know weird, okay?

21:25.151 --> 21:27.381
There is no non-weird explanation
for this.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.384
This morning, Emma was a baby.

21:29.555 --> 21:31.921
By sunset, she's Hannah Montana.

21:32.758 --> 21:33.850
Early years.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.099
- It's the professor.
- Oh, good, the professor.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.292
- I'm sure he'll crack this wide open.
- Shh.

21:44.403 --> 21:48.066
On this special night,
you join an exceptional family.

21:48.874 --> 21:53.675
You are ready to take your places
alongside us and learn our traditions.

21:54.246 --> 21:57.181
This is a tribute to the one who created
and protects us.

21:58.084 --> 22:01.349
We hunt for her. We kill for her.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.353
Now we consume that kill
as a symbol of unity with those...

22:04.523 --> 22:08.516
...who completed their blood missions
and furthered the life of the tribe.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.263
Go ahead, Emma.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.730
You need to eat.

22:29.748 --> 22:32.717
You know, identifying this scrawl
was no day at the beach.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.483
- Lesser scholars would have crumbled.
- Professor.

22:36.288 --> 22:38.085
- The symbol?
- Yeah, yeah.

22:38.257 --> 22:40.384
It's ancient, regional.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.720
Very difficult to identify...

22:42.895 --> 22:45.329
...but I managed to find a match.

22:45.498 --> 22:48.626
It's a variation of a symbol
associated with the Greek pantheon.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.964
The temple of the goddess Harmonia.
According to myth...

22:52.138 --> 22:54.766
...the coupling of Harmonia and Ares,
the god of war...

22:54.940 --> 22:56.601
...produced the Amazons.
Amazons.

22:56.775 --> 22:59.801
- Like Wonder Woman?
- No, like a tribe of warriors.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.071
They actually existed.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.772
The comic books,
they're just silly perversions.

23:03.949 --> 23:06.918
The symbol, I believe it originated
with the Amazons...

23:07.086 --> 23:09.611
...pictographs meant to pay homage
to Harmonia.

23:09.788 --> 23:12.154
Occult talismans, if you will.

23:12.324 --> 23:15.623
They had an exclusively female culture.
No use for men whatsoever.

23:15.794 --> 23:17.489
Except procreation.

23:17.663 --> 23:20.029
- All the vics were male.
- So you said.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.360
- With this symbol carved in their chests.
- Hands and feet cut off.

23:23.536 --> 23:26.198
- Now, that is interesting.
- Caught our attention.

23:26.372 --> 23:30.968
After they were impregnated, they killed
the male, first cutting off body parts.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.035
I couldn't check their IDs...

23:34.213 --> 23:36.477
...because everything they have
is fake.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.708
I've been digging for hours.

23:38.884 --> 23:41.250
And one thing's for sure,
they ain't FBI.

23:42.188 --> 23:45.783
<i>- And who are they?
- They're after us, is what they are.</i>

23:45.958 --> 23:47.789
Remember
that cross-country murder spree...

23:47.960 --> 23:49.951
...those crazy brothers went on
a couple months ago?

23:50.129 --> 23:52.461
<i>- That's them?
- That barely scratches the surface.</i>

23:53.832 --> 23:55.060
They're thugs.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.564
Vigilantes.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.237
But look, we've dealt with hunters
like this before.

23:59.405 --> 24:03.535
Well, the one is already scheduled
to be taken care of.

24:04.376 --> 24:06.844
Just simply add the other one
to the agenda.

24:08.347 --> 24:11.248
I know Bobby's got
a Grecian encyclopedia of weird in here.

24:11.417 --> 24:13.578
I saw it last time I was looking
for the stupid...

24:16.822 --> 24:20.019
- Would it kill him to have a system?
- He has a system.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.057
His files are set up like his brain.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.056
Uh. You got anything?

24:26.498 --> 24:29.524
Uh, yeah. There's this whole crazy side
to Amazon lore...

24:29.702 --> 24:31.727
...Professor Morrison
didn't even mention.

24:31.904 --> 24:35.704
He doesn't believe in it. A handicap
when you're trying to deal with it.

24:37.209 --> 24:38.335
Right. Um...

24:38.510 --> 24:40.569
Apparently,
there was this long bloody war.

24:40.746 --> 24:44.238
Amazon population was decimated.
They made a bargain with Harmonia...

24:44.416 --> 24:46.714
...to replenish their ranks,
make them stronger.

24:46.885 --> 24:49.410
I'd say throwing grown men
through walls is stronger.

24:49.588 --> 24:52.250
Yeah. Well, basically,
they became more than human.

24:52.424 --> 24:54.221
Harmonia turned them into monsters.

24:54.393 --> 24:56.884
Can you kill them like humans?
Or is there some kind of trick?

24:57.062 --> 24:58.086
Ugh...

24:58.264 --> 25:02.360
- Doesn't say. It could go either way.
- Well, that's helpful. What else?

25:05.204 --> 25:08.901
The lore says they reproduced quickly.

25:09.074 --> 25:13.135
As in, after mating,
they gave birth within 36 hours.

25:14.346 --> 25:18.783
Babies grew incredibly fast.
Then the aging process became normal.

25:18.951 --> 25:22.887
Which is one way to make an army,
I guess.

25:23.055 --> 25:24.716
The mating cycle's every two years.

25:24.890 --> 25:27.791
They send out all the women
who've reached child-bearing age.

25:27.960 --> 25:31.396
This lines up. This happens every
couple of years in different towns.

25:31.563 --> 25:33.622
Yeah. And we know for sure...

25:33.799 --> 25:36.927
...that at least some of the vics
hooked up with strange women...

25:37.102 --> 25:39.161
...days before being killed
Amazon-style.

25:41.006 --> 25:43.736
Hooked up in the same bar I met Lydia,
right?

25:43.909 --> 25:45.672
- Yeah.
- And then suddenly...

25:46.245 --> 25:49.772
...she's got a little baby
in, like, fruit fly time.

25:49.948 --> 25:53.247
That baby turns into a little girl
just as fast.

25:54.019 --> 25:55.452
Wow.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.151
- So maybe you're a...
- Don't say it.

25:59.525 --> 26:01.823
- If that kid's yours...
- I said don't say it.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.393
Fine, I won't. But, Dean...

26:04.129 --> 26:07.963
Dude, seriously. A one-night stand?
You're just gonna roll the dice?

26:08.133 --> 26:10.124
- You don't even...?
- Of course not, Sam.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.463
What, do you think I'm brain-dead?

26:13.005 --> 26:14.404
Accidents happen.

26:15.274 --> 26:18.607
If one even did, which l...
I don't think...

26:23.148 --> 26:25.708
No. Stop. We're not gonna talk
about this anymore...

26:25.918 --> 26:29.718
...because my skin's starting to crawl.
But if it's true, if it happened...

26:29.922 --> 26:31.116
I know.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.349
Hang on to my hands and feet.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.526
We are so pleased with your progress.

26:44.069 --> 26:46.537
You are absorbing the traditions
of our mothers.

26:46.705 --> 26:49.538
And you are close to fulfilling
your tribal destiny...

26:49.708 --> 26:52.006
...and taking your place
alongside your sisters.

26:52.177 --> 26:54.042
Today, you are a warrior.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.178
Though you may walk among others...

26:57.349 --> 27:00.147
...your heart is only with the tribe.

27:00.986 --> 27:05.047
Soon you will take
the final glorious step into adulthood.

27:05.224 --> 27:09.388
Today, you will learn how to endure pain
and how to inflict it.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.194
Fight it, Emma.

27:13.365 --> 27:16.459
As with all you do,
courage is everything.

27:22.408 --> 27:23.636
Going through Bobby's files...

27:23.809 --> 27:25.071
...is like dumpster diving.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.178
Yeah, tell me about it.

27:28.046 --> 27:32.005
So it makes sense why the Amazons
all wanted to hook up...

27:32.184 --> 27:34.414
...with decent-looking,
successful guys.

27:35.053 --> 27:36.987
- Picky about the gene pool?
- Right.

27:37.456 --> 27:38.616
So...

27:40.692 --> 27:42.353
So, what was Lydia doing with you?

27:43.295 --> 27:47.356
Well, she may or may not have thought
I was a rich investment banker.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.940
Sam.

27:57.743 --> 27:59.608
- Yeah?
- These papers just moved.

28:01.713 --> 28:04.113
- What?
- I didn't touch them.

28:18.096 --> 28:19.893
It's all over the place.

28:23.101 --> 28:24.796
Redline.

28:27.172 --> 28:28.833
Redline.

28:30.843 --> 28:36.941
Oh, and power lines by the open window
where there's a breeze...

28:37.149 --> 28:39.140
...that could've moved the papers.
You feel a breeze?

28:39.318 --> 28:41.946
Doesn't matter, Dean.
The readings are useless.

28:45.123 --> 28:47.091
Hey. Maybe, uh...

28:51.296 --> 28:53.423
- We burned him, Dean.
- So what?

28:53.599 --> 28:56.159
- What are you suggesting?
- I don't know. What are you?

28:56.335 --> 28:58.496
- Concentrate on something else.
- Why?

28:58.670 --> 29:00.137
Because it's not Bobby.

29:00.305 --> 29:01.533
- Could be.
- It couldn't be.

29:01.707 --> 29:03.641
- Why not?
- Because we want it to be.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.346
Maybe it's useful.

29:10.516 --> 29:12.882
It's in a pile of maybe it's useful.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.349
Besides, it's in Greek.
Nobody reads Greek.

29:15.521 --> 29:16.818
Yeah, except Greeks.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.980
Oh, and Bobby.

29:20.826 --> 29:22.123
And Professor Morrison.

29:23.962 --> 29:26.089
- Really?
- I'm going, Dean. You stay here.

29:26.732 --> 29:29.132
Keep the door locked.
Don't go anywhere.

29:30.369 --> 29:31.461
I mean it.

29:31.637 --> 29:32.831
Fine.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.313
You have got to be kidding.
I have office hours tomorrow.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.751
I'm sorry, professor, I need your help.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.388
The FBI isn't paying me enough
for this.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.252
All right, I'll sweeten the deal.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.529
We'll remove your wiretap.

30:40.806 --> 30:42.398
Hi.

30:43.108 --> 30:45.474
You don't know me,
but my name is Emma.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.478
I need your help.

30:48.981 --> 30:52.542
I think I'm in trouble
and you're the only person I can trust.

30:53.585 --> 30:54.984
Why?

30:55.721 --> 30:57.313
Because you're my father.

31:06.932 --> 31:09.628
- How'd you find me?
- They've been watching you.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.496
Ever since Mom got pregnant.

31:13.805 --> 31:17.002
If you're such a prisoner,
you mind telling me how you escaped?

31:17.209 --> 31:19.643
I waited until lights-out.

31:19.811 --> 31:22.712
The women who watch over us
change shifts a little after 10.

31:24.082 --> 31:25.845
Uh-huh. And you left because?

31:28.587 --> 31:30.782
They stick you in there...

31:31.156 --> 31:32.748
...and you trust them.

31:33.992 --> 31:35.960
It's all you know.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.758
And you don't question
what they want you to do.

31:40.298 --> 31:41.822
Terrible things.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.100
That's why I had to leave.

31:45.971 --> 31:47.768
They tortured me.

31:48.607 --> 31:52.634
They told me I had to endure pain
so I could be strong like them.

31:52.811 --> 31:54.438
But I don't wanna be like them.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.342
Okay.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.182
Come on in.

32:07.959 --> 32:09.620
Have a seat.

32:11.329 --> 32:13.524
Okay. Ahem.

32:13.699 --> 32:18.693
Let's assume
that you're not like them yet.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.539
What do you want me to do?

32:22.074 --> 32:23.632
Get me away from here.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.670
You're a good man.

32:29.181 --> 32:30.307
My mother told me that.

32:30.482 --> 32:31.676
Heh.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.715
I seriously doubt she said that.

32:34.419 --> 32:37.081
And if you knew me,
you would seriously doubt it's true.

32:37.856 --> 32:39.323
They told me you're a hunter.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.583
So maybe you'll understand
about me.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.887
Maybe you can protect me.

32:45.063 --> 32:47.827
Just long enough so I can get away.

32:49.367 --> 32:51.562
And then I'll leave you alone.

32:53.538 --> 32:55.199
I know you don't want me.

32:55.373 --> 32:58.809
All right, let's not go there, okay?
This isn't a matter of...

33:00.178 --> 33:02.840
Heh. You get this isn't a normal situation,
right?

33:03.014 --> 33:04.538
How would I know?

33:04.716 --> 33:06.707
Three days ago, I wasn't even alive.

33:07.252 --> 33:09.015
Now here I am.

33:09.187 --> 33:11.087
My mother threw me into that place...

33:11.256 --> 33:12.348
...and my father...

33:14.526 --> 33:15.686
Well...

33:18.330 --> 33:23.063
You get this is my last chance
to have anything normal, ever, right?

33:25.137 --> 33:27.401
- It's fascinating.
- What's it say?

33:27.572 --> 33:31.064
Oh, I haven't gotten there yet.
The paper is handmade.

33:31.243 --> 33:34.576
A cellulose, rather like papyrus.
Which would explain its durability.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.646
- Professor.
- Wherever did you get it?

33:36.815 --> 33:38.874
Uh... Um...

33:39.050 --> 33:40.984
A crazy drunk old genius.

33:41.153 --> 33:44.247
Yeah, they always have the good stuff.
Well, it's in Greek.

33:45.390 --> 33:48.154
- Yeah. Yeah, I know that.
- Not a common dialect.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.760
My God.
What is it with you and Amazons?

33:51.296 --> 33:55.062
- Professor, it's important.
- At 11:30 at night? It better be.

33:55.233 --> 33:56.632
Oh, here's a new twist.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.565
It repeats the conventional lore.

33:58.737 --> 34:01.399
Amazon warriors mate with males,
the males are murdered. Yada, yada.

34:01.573 --> 34:04.303
According to this,
it's not the women who do the killing.

34:04.476 --> 34:07.138
Instead, a ritual of initiation requires...

34:07.312 --> 34:09.576
...that the child born
of the mating process...

34:09.748 --> 34:11.648
...must kill her own father.

34:13.451 --> 34:14.918
What?

34:18.456 --> 34:20.424
You look exhausted.

34:20.926 --> 34:22.085
And starving.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.795
It's been a tough sweet 16.

34:27.098 --> 34:29.157
So you believe me?

34:31.203 --> 34:32.761
You'll help me?

34:34.206 --> 34:35.764
If you really want help.

34:41.545 --> 34:44.174
- Detective.
- Agent. You're here late.

34:45.217 --> 34:46.878
Yeah. Listen,
could we talk in the morning?

34:47.052 --> 34:49.782
- Unh.
- What's your hurry...

34:51.056 --> 34:52.784
...Sam?

34:52.958 --> 34:54.550
Sam Winchester.

34:54.726 --> 34:58.218
Let's see. I could run you in
for impersonating a federal agent.

35:26.725 --> 35:29.319
Well, what happens
when they find out you're missing?

35:29.494 --> 35:31.724
They may have already found out.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.391
They'll hunt me down.

35:40.739 --> 35:43.173
Look, I know this is gonna be hard...

35:43.341 --> 35:46.208
...but if I'm gonna get out,
I have to do it now.

35:46.378 --> 35:48.346
I got cheese and a leftover burrito.

35:48.847 --> 35:51.179
Doesn't make a difference.

35:58.256 --> 35:59.917
You were asking if I believed you.

36:09.267 --> 36:11.235
I was told you'd be a challenge.

36:12.370 --> 36:15.862
I figured you'd chat me up,
try and catch me off guard.

36:17.242 --> 36:19.608
Almost worked.
I was expecting your mother.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.877
It's not her place.

36:27.052 --> 36:29.953
- I have to kill you.
- Is that what they told you?

36:30.121 --> 36:32.316
- It's what I am.
- I should kill you right now.

36:32.524 --> 36:35.516
Sure. But you could've done that
30 seconds ago.

36:46.471 --> 36:48.598
It's weirdly hard, isn't it?

36:49.174 --> 36:50.664
- It is for me.
- Knock it off.

36:50.842 --> 36:52.434
How could it not be?
You're my father.

36:52.610 --> 36:55.078
- Hey, we're not gonna do that.
- It's true.

36:55.246 --> 36:59.080
You're the reason we're standing here.
I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.148
So now someone has to kill someone.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.319
You know what?

37:07.993 --> 37:10.086
So far,
my childhood's been disappointing.

37:10.261 --> 37:12.752
You haven't killed anybody yet,
Emma.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.361
Walk away.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.502
Right now. I won't go after you.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.833
I can't.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.636
I don't have a choice.

37:31.282 --> 37:33.011
Please, don't let him hurt me.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.716
This is the mother ship.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.325
Let's get this done.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.633
They're gone.

38:45.690 --> 38:47.920
You know what, I don't like it either.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.719
I wanted to torch them
just as much as you.

38:50.895 --> 38:55.423
Yeah, but, hey, next time they surface,
we'll be ready.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.968
If we live that long.

39:01.206 --> 39:03.936
All right, fine.
Just sit there and be pissed.

39:06.244 --> 39:07.871
What did you say to me?

39:08.046 --> 39:10.879
When I was the one who choked.
What did you say about Amy?

39:11.049 --> 39:13.449
- You kill the monster.
- I was going to.

39:13.618 --> 39:16.416
- The hell you were. Think I'm an idiot?
- You think I am?

39:16.588 --> 39:20.422
- Dean, you were gonna let her walk.
- No, I wasn't. That's ridiculous.

39:20.625 --> 39:22.616
Look, man. She was not yours.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.318
Not really.

39:27.098 --> 39:30.067
Actually, she, uh... She was, really.

39:31.002 --> 39:34.563
She just also happened to be
a crazy man-killing monster.

39:34.739 --> 39:36.934
- But, uh, hey...
- You know what? Bobby was right.

39:37.942 --> 39:41.275
Your head's not in it, man. When Cass
died, you were wobbly, but now...

39:41.446 --> 39:43.073
Now what?

39:43.248 --> 39:46.240
What, you're dealing with it so perfect?
Yeah. News flash, pal.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.942
You're just as screwed up as I am.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.213
You're just bigger.

39:54.292 --> 39:55.919
- What?
- I don't know.

39:59.297 --> 40:04.166
Look, Dean, the thing is, tonight, it...

40:05.537 --> 40:08.028
It almost got you killed.
I don't care how you deal.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.831
I really, really don't.

40:10.008 --> 40:11.805
But just don't...

40:13.244 --> 40:15.178
Don't get killed.

40:18.283 --> 40:19.341
I'll do what I can.

40:22.153 --> 40:25.122
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- Means I'll do what I can.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.451
You can shut up about it.
