Forgive my using notes, Detective,
to refresh a failing memory.

36:05.538 --> 36:09.125
I see, it's now six years ago
that as I questioned you at a hearing

36:09.250 --> 36:12.336
convened for the same purpose,
which brings us here today...

36:13.462 --> 36:15.214

36:15.423 --> 36:19.260
"as 'grossly illegal
and unconstitutional...'"

your methods of securing evidence.

36:23.514 --> 36:27.059

your attempts to explain and justify

36:27.143 --> 36:29.770
your conduct as "pitiful."

36:32.523 --> 36:33.524
Yes.

that you take the stand,
and swear your oath

36:43.910 --> 36:47.496
here before us today as a changed man?

your "truthfulness" six years ago

into a defendant's automobile tire

37:08.976 --> 37:11.229
while he drank espresso in a café...

37:12.146 --> 37:14.649
so that when the defendant
returned to his car

37:14.982 --> 37:18.945
to get a jack to fix his flat,
you could happen by...

37:19.946 --> 37:24.367
and satisfy your yen to discover
if he had contraband in his trunk?

37:36.671 --> 37:39.298
given who you are, don't you agree

37:39.590 --> 37:42.969
we would be well-advised
to take your declarations

37:43.052 --> 37:45.972
about Jane Street with a grain of salt?

37:48.182 --> 37:49.183
No.

38:12.832 --> 38:17.295
Your Honor, every minute
that Detective Sipowicz spent

38:17.545 --> 38:19.046
in the apartment on Jane Street,

38:19.130 --> 38:22.633
he was in the company of his lieutenant
and four other detectives.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.803
Now, before ruling on the admissibility
of people's five,

38:25.928 --> 38:30.099
would the court wish me to call those men
to support Detective Sipowicz's testimony?

38:30.349 --> 38:33.394
Why didn't you call one
of the other detectives to begin with?

38:33.561 --> 38:35.688
Because if he didn't testify
for the people,

38:35.771 --> 38:39.567
you had stated your intention to call
my husband... Detective Sipowicz,

38:39.775 --> 38:44.196
as a defense witness,
gratuitously and simply to embarrass him.

38:44.363 --> 38:49.285
Your Honor, Mr. Sinclair tries to lug
in part of Detective Sipowicz's past

38:49.368 --> 38:53.247
which is no longer relevant
because the circumstances of the present

38:53.456 --> 38:56.584
are so uncongenial to his client's case.

As for Ms. Costas imputing to me a try
at "lugging in the past," Your Honor...

39:25.696 --> 39:30.326
I had trusted Detective Sipowicz here
to help me with the heavy lifting.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.038
