WEBVTT

00:09.177 --> 00:12.280
( whinnying )

00:23.624 --> 00:25.326
Fan out.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.027
Kill them all.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.166
( grunts )

00:34.268 --> 00:37.438
Colts, stay put.
You're on lookout.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.444
- ( swords clang )
- ( grunts )

00:49.717 --> 00:51.585
Find the Widow.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.763
( grunts, yells )

01:06.267 --> 01:07.768
( yells )

01:23.551 --> 01:26.187
( grunting )

01:29.457 --> 01:32.493
( grunting )

01:55.716 --> 01:57.251
( groans )

02:17.738 --> 02:20.140
Minerva.

02:22.876 --> 02:26.380
Open the passage.
Get the girls to safety.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.459
Hurry!
Come on, go!

02:38.492 --> 02:40.628
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.830
Okay, okay.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.232
( whispers)
Tilda.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.300
( gasps )

02:47.735 --> 02:50.204
Esta:
Tilda, hurry!

03:07.521 --> 03:09.523
No one comes after
my family.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.892
We both know I was
doing you a favor.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.529
Mm.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.598
( hums )

03:17.631 --> 03:19.333
( yells )

03:20.801 --> 03:22.803
( grunting )

03:32.280 --> 03:33.747
( panting )

03:36.884 --> 03:39.353
( grunting )

04:20.594 --> 04:22.696
( grunts, groans )

04:22.730 --> 04:25.999
( inhales, growls )

04:31.805 --> 04:33.541
( groans )

04:39.913 --> 04:42.015
Baron!

04:49.957 --> 04:51.959
( grunting )

04:59.467 --> 05:01.435
( theme music playing )

05:37.137 --> 05:39.473
( birds chirping )

05:45.846 --> 05:48.115
Um...
( sighs )

05:48.148 --> 05:51.419
Jade, I appreciate it,
but you really don't
need to be here.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.355
Ryder's gonna be
my family as well.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.569
Do you know
why Quinn proposed to you?

06:11.572 --> 06:13.807
You're a distraction.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.577
Something to feed his ego.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.779
Make him
feel young again.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.048
I understand
you're upset, Baroness.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.617
But I am not the enemy.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.553
Well, if you believe that,
then you really haven't

06:25.586 --> 06:26.920
the faintest clue
about this life.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.389
I've been in this house
since I was a girl.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.693
I understand
more than you think.

06:32.726 --> 06:36.564
When your son is lying
in front of you
slipping away

06:36.597 --> 06:39.166
while you look on,
helpless,

06:39.199 --> 06:42.570
then you can tell me
what you understand.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.443
So a word of advice
from one wife to another--

06:51.545 --> 06:55.916
a baron's home
isn't a sanctuary,
it's a battlefield.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.586
Quinn isn't interested
in peace.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.187
He never was.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.623
He loves to fight.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.029
Now, if you would do me
the courtesy of leaving

07:09.062 --> 07:11.499
so I can be
with my son

07:11.532 --> 07:13.467
in private.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.707
Mari, is everything
all right?

07:19.740 --> 07:21.041
- The Clippers are coming back
through the gate.
- And the baron?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.543
He's leading them.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.563
He was a good man.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.865
Now he's a dead one.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.269
Sunny.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.204
I found something.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.040
The Widow had it.

07:53.073 --> 07:56.476
I can't read it,
but it's a book
about Azra.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.647
You went
inside that house?

07:59.680 --> 08:00.881
I had to get the book.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.624
Come with me.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.835
So the Widow got away.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.271
Good news travels fast.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.839
Well, congratulations,
Quinn.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.609
You gave her exactly
what she wanted--
a war.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.678
Remember the last one?

08:30.711 --> 08:33.213
Two years under siege,
food shortages?

08:33.246 --> 08:36.149
Let those bastards
try and come at me, huh?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.818
I took her oil fields.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.288
And now your Clippers
are spread over two
territories.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.892
You think they'll be able
to defend themselves
stretched that thin?

08:44.925 --> 08:48.596
- I was avenging Ryder.
- Oh, you don't give
a damn about him.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.898
You're just worried
about looking weak.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.166
Well, thanks to your son,
I had no choice.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.969
Don't you dare
talk about him

08:56.003 --> 08:57.838
when he is lying
in there dying.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.308
- He's not dying, woman.
- Then why won't he wake?

09:01.341 --> 09:03.977
His breathing
isn't more than a whisper.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.879
Something is wrong.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.848
And what would you
have me do?

09:07.881 --> 09:11.218
Well, I would say
go fetch the doctor,
but he's dead.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.889
Of course, you wouldn't
know anything about that,
would you?

09:48.355 --> 09:50.858
Your face, it's cut.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.758
( muffled panting,
moaning )

10:37.404 --> 10:39.639
( all shouting )

10:44.912 --> 10:46.747
- Come here.
- ( gasps )

10:46.780 --> 10:48.816
Heels out, arms up.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.184
Now stay there.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.355
- How long?
- Till I come back.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.226
This is bullshit.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.400
This is lesson one
in your training.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.870
- It's about time.
- ( scoffs )

11:11.872 --> 11:14.808
( grunts, groans )

11:16.076 --> 11:17.878
Get up.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.289
Sunny:
Look out there.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.858
What do you see?

11:32.860 --> 11:36.429
Horses, cogs, poppies.

11:36.463 --> 11:37.931
That's your problem.

11:37.965 --> 11:41.168
You only react
to what's in front of you.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.903
Look beyond this wall.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.304
Beyond these fields.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.907
That is our way out.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.276
Do you still
want to go home?

11:49.309 --> 11:50.744
You know I do.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.279
Then you have to
start listening to me

11:52.312 --> 11:53.346
or you'll get
us both killed.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.449
I'm not the one who's
gonna get us killed,

11:56.483 --> 11:57.751
the baron is.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.953
Attacking the Widow
was a bad idea.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.521
I didn't do it
for Quinn.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.323
We need to find her.

12:03.356 --> 12:06.059
As long as she's still alive,
she's gonna hunt you down.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.295
- Never forget that.
- If you're so worried
about me,

12:08.328 --> 12:10.998
maybe you should teach me
how to fight so that I could
defend myself.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.402
Okay, you wanna fight?

12:15.435 --> 12:17.737
Let's see you fight.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.945
You need to see Ryder.

12:26.413 --> 12:30.217
Well, that's kind of you
to be thinking of him.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.420
But I can't look at him
in that state.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.492
I know somebody
who could help him.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.863
But Lydia
won't like it.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.199
You save her son...

12:47.835 --> 12:51.038
...she'll find it
in her heart to forgive you.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.954
( bell rings )

13:16.629 --> 13:19.166
I'm embarrassed it's taken me
this long to stop by.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.972
A baron's wife
doesn't have any reason
to visit my clinic.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.974
I'm still the same girl
you grew up with.

13:29.877 --> 13:32.479
I was so sorry
to hear about your parents.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.154
I'm guessing this isn't
a condolence call.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.194
Ryder has been injured.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.429
He should have
recovered by now.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.998
Everybody is worried.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.834
And you want me
to come and take
a look at him.

13:58.105 --> 14:00.908
I'm surprised
the baron would approve

14:00.941 --> 14:03.376
of a cog doctor
tending to his son.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.279
I vouched for you.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.552
I have a simple life.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.325
I wanna keep it that way.
I'm sorry, Jade.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.906
I can't let Ryder die.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.377
Just please help.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.661
Now, that sounds
like two visitors.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.064
One is Sunny for sure

14:57.097 --> 14:59.566
and the other
is somebody...

14:59.599 --> 15:00.600
small.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.172
Waldo, meet M.K.

15:11.544 --> 15:12.980
I was Waldo's Colt.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.248
You were a Clipper?

15:15.282 --> 15:17.184
Regent.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.352
What happened?

15:19.386 --> 15:21.955
Well, let's just say
I don't get around much
anymore.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.490
M.K. here seems
to think training

15:23.523 --> 15:25.192
is only
about fighting.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.194
I was hoping
you'd help me out with him.

15:27.227 --> 15:31.298
Aw, Sunshine,
you sure know how to make
an old man feel young.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.266
I'd be real pleased
to pitch in,

15:33.300 --> 15:37.404
except, well, this runt
is just too damn small.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.106
He's never
gonna make it.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.042
Sunny:
You wanted to fight.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.410
Now you fight.

15:44.711 --> 15:45.645
Him?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.982
No way,
he's in a wheelchair.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.322
Waldo:
What's the matter?

15:55.355 --> 15:57.957
You afraid you're gonna
get your ass kicked?

15:59.559 --> 16:01.995
- No.
- If you can land
a hit on him,

16:02.029 --> 16:03.496
I'll train you
any way you want.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.137
And...

16:10.170 --> 16:12.372
I won't even
use my legs.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.542
This is ridiculous.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.980
( grunting )

16:35.762 --> 16:36.663
Come on.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.469
( groans )

16:56.583 --> 16:58.685
( panting )

17:00.687 --> 17:02.589
All right.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.425
- All right, enough.
- Waldo: Oh, good.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.261
I'm getting kind of tired
of kicking your ass.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.731
Get up.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.501
( grunts )

17:17.404 --> 17:20.607
Now, you lost that fight
before you threw a punch.

17:20.640 --> 17:24.644
You saw a busted-up old man
in a wheelchair.

17:24.677 --> 17:27.480
( tsks )
You underestimate
your enemy in battle,

17:27.514 --> 17:30.350
odds are you won't live
to see another.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.358
You know why
we call 'em Colts?

17:39.792 --> 17:41.528
'Cause we gotta
break 'em

17:41.561 --> 17:43.463
like wild horses.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.366
That's the only way
to make a Clipper
out of a boy.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.477
( footsteps approaching )

17:58.878 --> 18:00.613
Lydia, this is Veil.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.684
I know who she is.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.586
Baroness.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.469
He suffered a major trauma.
His brain is swollen.

18:22.502 --> 18:25.138
I need to relieve
the pressure immediately.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.147
You're not touching him
with that.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.886
This is a trepanation device.
It's the only way.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.455
And I'm sure
you do fine work,

18:42.489 --> 18:44.491
but you're not qualified
to treat my son.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.160
Injuries don't discriminate
between cogs and barons.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.127
Get out.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.732
How long does he have
if we do nothing?

18:52.765 --> 18:54.801
He'll be dead
by nightfall.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.307
You have to
let her try.

19:04.444 --> 19:07.414
It's very important
that you keep his head
completely still.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.266
- ( skull cracks )
- ( gasps )

19:36.876 --> 19:38.945
What is this place,
Mother?

19:38.978 --> 19:42.181
Every butterfly needs
a sanctuary.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.785
This is ours.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.665
Go to the doll house.
Fetch Angelica.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.368
With Sunny alive,
her life is in danger.

20:01.401 --> 20:04.203
- Hurry, child.
- Yes, Mother.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.785
Quinn:
You must be Veil.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.826
Jade told me
about your parents.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.231
They were good people.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.468
I'll do everything
in my power

20:35.502 --> 20:37.770
to find the scum
that killed them.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.774
Thank you, Baron.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.245
How's my son?

20:47.447 --> 20:48.681
Improving.

20:48.715 --> 20:51.784
But he's not
out of the woods.

20:51.818 --> 20:55.722
You're the girl
Sunny's been wicking.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.559
You don't think I know
how my regent spends
his spare time?

20:59.592 --> 21:03.330
I must say he has
exquisite taste.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.468
Ryder's bandages
will need changing.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.002
I'll return
in the morning.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.409
Thank you.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.815
I'll have to find
the proper way
to repay you.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.454
( coughs )

21:44.637 --> 21:45.171
( insects chirping )

21:57.450 --> 21:59.519
- Hey, Ringo.
- Hey.

21:59.552 --> 22:03.122
The Widow's gone underground.
You hear anything?

22:03.155 --> 22:06.025
No, but, um,
I'll let you know
as soon as I do.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.797
You haven't stopped by
for a while.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.701
Yeah.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.569
I think I'm done
sitting in that chair.

22:16.603 --> 22:18.938
You quit clipping?

22:18.971 --> 22:21.374
- I quit keeping score.
- ( chuckles )

22:21.408 --> 22:24.143
You know what's funny?

22:24.176 --> 22:27.580
Every Clipper and Colt
through that door--

22:27.614 --> 22:29.416
they all wanna be you.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.818
And you--

22:31.851 --> 22:34.020
you don't wanna be you.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.525
( door opens )

22:38.558 --> 22:40.927
Regent, baron's
looking for you.

22:40.960 --> 22:44.030
Well, guess it's time
to get back to work,
Sunny.

22:59.178 --> 23:00.813
What are you
doing here?

23:00.847 --> 23:03.583
Believe me,
I didn't have a choice.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.117
Quinn:
Sunny.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.019
Get in here.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.568
Tell them.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.539
It was a doll
at the Tick-Tock Club.

23:28.475 --> 23:30.176
Angelica.

23:30.209 --> 23:32.745
She set me up.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.581
Top floor,

23:34.614 --> 23:37.083
last room on the right.

23:37.116 --> 23:38.951
The blonde.

23:38.985 --> 23:41.454
Alive, Sunny.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.022
She'll lead us
to the Widow.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.824
Yes, Baron.

23:48.628 --> 23:49.962
( engine whirs )

23:54.033 --> 23:57.103
M.K.:
Is this another
training exercise?

23:57.136 --> 23:58.838
We're going
to a doll house.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.674
I want you to get up
on that balcony

24:01.708 --> 24:03.476
and make sure
she doesn't get away.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.712
I'll watch
from down here.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.114
Give me a description
of this girl

24:08.147 --> 24:09.682
so I know
what she looks like.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.951
She'll be the one
running for her life.

24:30.837 --> 24:33.072
- Hey.
- ( grunts )

24:34.874 --> 24:38.210
I brought you home.
I trusted you and look
what happened.

24:38.244 --> 24:41.681
- It's not what it looks like.
- Then why are you wearing
that Colt uniform?

24:41.714 --> 24:44.150
You've been lying to me
since we've met.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.085
I lied because
I was scared.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.854
You know what your mother
wants to do to me.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.922
You're better off with her
than you are with Quinn.

24:49.956 --> 24:53.259
I know you don't believe that.
She's just as bad as he is.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.595
You don't add up.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.764
Neither do you.

24:59.899 --> 25:05.037
( woman laughs )
Oh, is that what
you want?

25:05.071 --> 25:07.039
Now, that's
gonna cost extra.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.951
( woman laughs )

25:18.985 --> 25:20.620
You came
to the right place.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.656
Ah. Hey!

25:25.692 --> 25:27.059
( grunts )

25:31.664 --> 25:33.132
( grunting )

25:43.910 --> 25:45.578
( grunting )

25:45.612 --> 25:47.279
Stop!

25:47.313 --> 25:49.982
- Where is the Widow?
- ( yells )

25:53.853 --> 25:55.221
( gasps )

26:09.769 --> 26:11.771
( breathing heavily )

26:15.775 --> 26:18.244
I said
where is the Widow?

26:18.277 --> 26:19.846
You'll never find her.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.356
( groans )

26:30.389 --> 26:33.325
You're going to tell me
where she is.

26:33.359 --> 26:36.062
You can't stop her.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.164
And you can't stop me.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.169
( thuds )

26:43.202 --> 26:44.837
- ( crowd murmurs )
- Go.

27:03.690 --> 27:04.023
( bell rings )

27:12.464 --> 27:14.133
( door shuts )

27:14.166 --> 27:16.168
Something I can do
for you, Regent?

27:16.202 --> 27:17.904
I need a stitch job.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.042
Sunny, what happened?

27:26.245 --> 27:29.115
I'll tell you in the back
when you're sewing me up.

27:38.324 --> 27:41.127
She's the one
you want me to protect.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.162
Am I right?

27:43.195 --> 27:45.798
Stay put and don't
touch anything.

27:47.433 --> 27:49.068
Okay.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.287
Who's the boy?

28:09.388 --> 28:11.357
My Colt, M.K.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.293
Your Colt?

28:14.326 --> 28:17.363
Why take on a Colt
if we're leaving?

28:17.396 --> 28:19.966
Nothing's changed.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.467
Don't worry.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.135
( clears throat )

28:23.169 --> 28:26.305
Those arms and legs,
did you make them?

28:27.907 --> 28:30.342
Yeah, they're called
mimics.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.444
And the books?

28:32.478 --> 28:34.213
You can read?

28:34.246 --> 28:35.848
Out.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.153
( sighs )

28:41.187 --> 28:44.156
Maybe he's good practice
for what's to come.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.895
I want you to stay out
of that house.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.530
I don't have a choice.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.166
At least not
until Ryder's recovered.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.035
I should have
let him die.

28:58.370 --> 28:59.906
Quinn knows about us.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.743
We can't leave
soon enough.

29:11.851 --> 29:14.153
73.

29:16.923 --> 29:20.459
That's how many days
you were gone when
the nomads took you.

29:20.492 --> 29:24.363
I spent
every waking moment
standing at this window.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.334
I even started
praying again.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.769
But when you walked back
through that door,

29:32.839 --> 29:35.174
my sweet little boy
was gone.

29:37.009 --> 29:40.312
In his place was a broken,
damaged thing.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.385
I didn't wanna see that.

29:46.418 --> 29:49.088
So I held you close.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.790
Tended to your wounds.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.061
I even cleaned
and dressed your foot

29:55.094 --> 29:57.529
when you were too ashamed
for anyone else to see it.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.905
I taught you
how to walk again.

30:07.874 --> 30:10.943
I did everything
for you, Ryder.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.846
I thought I could
bring you back.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.949
That you had the will
of your father.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.987
But you don't.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.556
What is this about?

30:24.590 --> 30:26.292
( gasps )

30:31.497 --> 30:33.966
A mother's love
is a powerful thing.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.869
But it can blind you.

30:40.372 --> 30:42.608
You tried to have
the Widow killed.

30:42.641 --> 30:46.012
You disobeyed your father,
then lied about it.

30:46.045 --> 30:48.347
I was acting
in his best interest.

30:48.380 --> 30:51.217
One in a lifetime
of stupid decisions.

30:51.250 --> 30:54.153
Decisions that I defended.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.889
Much as I hate
to admit it,

30:56.923 --> 30:58.991
your father's right.

31:00.927 --> 31:03.262
You don't have
what it takes
to be baron.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.170
Get out.

31:20.712 --> 31:24.316
I'd rather have you hate me
for the rest of your life

31:24.350 --> 31:26.552
than stand over
your grave.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.358
You're on your own,
Ryder.

31:45.071 --> 31:48.040
( insects chirping )

31:48.074 --> 31:51.277
( cooing )

31:51.310 --> 31:55.081
It appears I have
ruffled the feathers
of my fellow Barons.

31:55.114 --> 31:58.017
They view the possession
of the Widow's oil fields

31:58.050 --> 32:00.652
as a violation
of the Foundation Treaty.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.288
They want to parley.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.457
You'll be walking
into an execution.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.259
Agreed.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.495
I need to make
an alliance

32:09.528 --> 32:11.297
with a baron
who hates me less

32:11.330 --> 32:13.132
than he hates
the others.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.267
Jacobee.

32:15.301 --> 32:17.403
I can't make
a direct overture,

32:17.436 --> 32:21.240
but as I recall,
you've a history
with his regent.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.642
I haven't seen Zypher
in a long time.

32:23.675 --> 32:26.945
Well, now's the moment
to rekindle the relationship.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.550
Unless there's
gonna be a problem.

32:31.583 --> 32:34.220
Not at all, Baron.

32:42.761 --> 32:45.097
( crickets chirping )

33:40.386 --> 33:42.154
He's sleeping.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.431
Well done.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.117
( engine whirring )

34:29.735 --> 34:31.370
Sunny:
Hello, Zypher.

34:31.403 --> 34:32.671
You look like shit.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.773
Good to see you, too.

34:34.806 --> 34:38.310
What are we
doing here, Sunny?
You miss me?

34:38.344 --> 34:40.746
Quinn's not showing up
at that parley.

34:40.779 --> 34:43.249
He's making a mistake.

34:43.282 --> 34:45.251
Seems to be doing that
a lot lately.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.452
Quinn's not the enemy.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.387
The Widow is.
You know that.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.823
Sunny, the other barons
don't want a war.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.792
There hasn't been one
in five years.

34:53.825 --> 34:56.162
Now, there is a way
for you to stop all this.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.697
Avoid a lot of bloodshed.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.466
( scoffs )

35:00.499 --> 35:02.201
You think I'm gonna clip
my own baron?

35:02.234 --> 35:04.203
The other barons
will recognize you
for it.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.537
Jacobee will make sure
of it.

35:05.571 --> 35:08.174
Then you all divide up
the Widow's oil fields

35:08.207 --> 35:09.408
and everybody wins.

35:11.710 --> 35:14.513
I need you
to arrange a meeting
between Jacobee and Quinn.

35:14.546 --> 35:17.516
Ugh, loyal to a fault.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.850
What's in it for me?

35:18.884 --> 35:20.719
What do you want?

35:20.752 --> 35:24.590
Well, you have to ask?

35:24.623 --> 35:26.725
( chuckles )

35:26.758 --> 35:28.660
Who is she?

35:30.262 --> 35:32.898
Aw, and you think
she's gonna save you, huh?

35:32.931 --> 35:35.634
You know we're both
way past saving, Sunny.

35:36.935 --> 35:39.137
You gonna tell me
it's serious?

35:41.573 --> 35:43.875
You're playing with fire
if Quinn finds out,
you know that?

35:43.909 --> 35:46.478
Are we finished?

35:46.512 --> 35:48.146
Yeah.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.518
I'll talk to Jacobee,
but don't hold
your breath.

35:52.551 --> 35:54.152
I won't.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.757
The other offer's
still on the table
if you change your mind.

36:00.926 --> 36:04.296
You know I'm
a lot more persuasive
when I get what I want.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.837
( car door opens )

36:23.615 --> 36:26.785
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to get to Angelica
in time.

36:28.587 --> 36:31.523
I'm sure you did
everything in your power
to help her.

36:37.263 --> 36:39.331
You were the last one
in the tunnel today.

36:41.733 --> 36:42.968
Yes.

36:43.001 --> 36:46.505
That special book,
the one on my desk,

36:46.538 --> 36:48.674
you didn't see it,
did you?

36:48.707 --> 36:51.243
No, Mother, I'm sorry.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.211
I didn't.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.716
Good night, Tilda.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.610
( knock on door )

37:58.644 --> 38:00.412
( bell rings )

38:09.588 --> 38:11.590
What are you doing here?

38:11.623 --> 38:13.959
How did you get
outside the wall?

38:13.992 --> 38:16.628
It's probably better
you not know.

38:18.897 --> 38:22.033
I'm guessing
you didn't tell Sunny
you were coming?

38:24.102 --> 38:25.704
Something smells good.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.046
Oh, thank you.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.983
( laughs )
You're welcome.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.520
You know,
I'm still trying
to figure out

38:41.553 --> 38:43.622
why Sunny took you on
as a Colt.

38:45.691 --> 38:48.627
I'm still trying
to figure out how you two
ended up together.

38:50.762 --> 38:53.865
Normally,
when Sunny shows up,
people end up dead.

38:55.767 --> 38:59.405
Look, you didn't come here
to hear my little story.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.878
You have to read
this book for me.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.883
It's beautiful.

39:21.460 --> 39:24.896
- I don't recognize
this language.
- ( bell rings )

39:26.965 --> 39:28.033
Hello.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.442
Baron?

39:36.475 --> 39:38.544
Quinn:
Your door was unlocked.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.512
You should be
more careful.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.115
Where's your escort?

39:44.149 --> 39:46.685
Oh, I sometimes
walk alone.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.455
It helps
to clear my head.

39:50.989 --> 39:53.058
Is everything all right?

39:53.091 --> 39:56.628
- Did something
happen with Ryder?
- No, Ryder's fine,

39:56.662 --> 39:58.830
thanks to you.

39:58.864 --> 40:03.168
You took control
of a desperate situation.

40:03.201 --> 40:06.605
I'm in your debt.

40:08.607 --> 40:12.678
Intelligence is
an intoxicating quality
in a woman.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.186
Please...

40:21.219 --> 40:23.989
...just tell me
what you want.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.757
It's very simple.

40:26.892 --> 40:28.960
You saved my son.

40:31.497 --> 40:34.833
Now save me.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.550
( music playing )
