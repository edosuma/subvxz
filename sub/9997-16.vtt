WEBVTT

00:01.916 --> 00:02.916
Where is this?

00:03.016 --> 00:04.684
This place where you
and Mommy got married?

00:04.718 --> 00:08.186
It's in California.

00:08.221 --> 00:10.222
A ace called San Luis Obispo.

00:10.256 --> 00:12.657
But you and Mommy lived
here in Phoenix, right?

00:12.691 --> 00:15.660
Why'd you have to go all the way
out there to get married?

00:15.693 --> 00:17.695
Uh, I don't know.

00:17.729 --> 00:19.896
It was just... it was just
kind of a compromise.

00:19.931 --> 00:22.275
Your mom wanted
a little wedding here.

00:22.310 --> 00:25.641
Grandma and Grandpa Dubois
wanted big wedding

00:25.675 --> 00:27.563
in Grosse Pointe,
overlooking the lake,

00:27.598 --> 00:32.057
so we ended up in California,
overlooking the ocean.

00:32.091 --> 00:34.263
You sure you really want
to put all these pictures

00:34.298 --> 00:36.335
of you and Mommy away?

00:36.370 --> 00:39.122
I mean, what happens
when she comes back?

00:39.156 --> 00:42.199
Won't it hurt her feelings when
she sees that they're all gone?

00:42.234 --> 00:43.346
Come on, Bridge.

00:43.380 --> 00:45.069
Your mom hasn't been here
in forever.

00:45.104 --> 00:47.259
I know you don't want
hear it,

00:47.294 --> 00:48.948
but I don't think
she's coming back.

00:56.552 --> 00:57.735
Yeah?

00:57.770 --> 01:00.487
You okay?

01:00.521 --> 01:03.886
No... no, I don't know.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.202
I don't knowif it's t.

01:06.236 --> 01:09.625
or not being able to drink, but
I just had the strangest dream.

01:09.659 --> 01:11.439
Was there any sex in it?

01:14.327 --> 01:16.673
No.

01:16.708 --> 01:19.059
No, it was sad.

01:19.094 --> 01:23.084
We were married
and we had this little girl.

01:23.119 --> 01:26.770
Well, I guess I left you--
I left both of you.

01:26.804 --> 01:29.620
You still want to be
Mrs. Joe Dubois though, right?

01:29.654 --> 01:32.436
I mean, I'd hate to think we
brought all these people here

01:32.471 --> 01:34.781
to California just to senf them home

01:34.815 --> 01:36.057
without even having
a wedding.

01:36.736 --> 01:38.836
Well that'll never happen.

01:39.174 --> 01:41.016
It was just a dream.pen.

Hi.

02:36.484 --> 02:38.004
You okay in there?

02:38.418 --> 02:39.538
I'm fabulous.

02:41.754 --> 02:43.574
Your mom and dad get in alright?

02:43.835 --> 02:45.435
Yeah. My dad's
already complained

02:45.469 --> 02:48.337
about the plane ride,
the car rental, anhis room.

02:48.372 --> 02:50.607
My mom's already been
down to the bakery

02:50.641 --> 02:54.046
to make sure that our cake
is made to her specifications.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.613
yeah, I'd say
they're fine.

02:55.648 --> 02:56.915
Same as always.

02:56.949 --> 03:00.151
Hey, you wanted me to remind you
to reconfirm the deejay.

03:00.185 --> 03:01.352
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

03:01.386 --> 03:02.786
I got to get presents
for the groomsmen.

03:02.820 --> 03:04.421
I have to make sure
that the welcome baskets

03:04.455 --> 03:06.689
are ready for the rest of
the guests when they check in.

03:06.723 --> 03:08.658
Are you sure you just don't want
to meet them now

03:08.692 --> 03:09.693
and get it over with?

03:09.694 --> 03:12.529
You know, if you had told me

03:12.563 --> 03:14.997
that I actually d to meet your
parents in order to marry you,

03:15.032 --> 03:18.634
I might not have accepted
your proposal.

03:18.668 --> 03:20.603
Hmm? What are you
so nervous about?

03:20.638 --> 03:21.904
They're gonna love you.

03:21.939 --> 03:23.372
How can you be so sure?

03:23.407 --> 03:26.909
Because I love you, so they
don't really have a choice.

03:26.943 --> 03:28.710
Come on. What do you say?

03:28.744 --> 03:31.012
Mm, your mouth tastes
all fresh and minty.

03:31.046 --> 03:33.381
Hmm? Come on, let's
just go down the hall

03:33.415 --> 03:34.448
and get it over with.

03:34.482 --> 03:37.484
Hi. Hi, my name's Allison.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.152
I'm going to marry your boy.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.487
Oh, and by the way,
I'm pregnant.

03:41.521 --> 03:44.021
Nice to meet you.

03:44.055 --> 03:46.023
Don't be such a smartass.

03:46.057 --> 03:48.391
I thought you decided that we
weren't going to say anything

03:48.426 --> 03:50.628
about the baby until you hit
the three-month mark.

03:50.662 --> 03:53.699
Yeah, I did, and I won't.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.300
Six or seven weeks
is plenty of time

03:55.335 --> 03:57.169
to tell people the good news.

03:57.203 --> 03:59.504
And tonight at dinner is my time
to meet your parents.

03:59.539 --> 04:01.606
The maid?

04:01.640 --> 04:04.041
The maid of honor.

04:06.011 --> 04:08.879
I'm coming, Kim.

04:08.913 --> 04:10.947
I have the list
of what we ordered

04:10.982 --> 04:12.549
for the rehearsal dinner
torrow night,

04:12.583 --> 04:14.751
but do you have the receipt
for the actual ceremony?

04:14.785 --> 04:16.552
I think so.

04:16.587 --> 04:18.654
I'm sorry.
Who's next?

04:18.688 --> 04:20.522
Can I help you?
Uh, I hope so.

04:20.555 --> 04:24.125
I was wondering: would you mind
putting up one of these flyers?

04:24.159 --> 04:25.693
That's my daughter Julie.

04:25.727 --> 04:27.361
She hasn't been home
in two days.

04:27.395 --> 04:28.928
She drove off in her
little blue car

04:28.963 --> 04:30.396
and no one has
seen her since.

04:30.430 --> 04:31.730
Would you mind if I...

04:31.764 --> 04:33.364
if I put up
one of these?
Sure.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.365
Thank you.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.433
Excuse me.

04:35.467 --> 04:38.203
Can I help you?

05:01.656 --> 05:03.990
Hi, I'm Kim Clement,
and this is Allison Rolen.

05:04.024 --> 05:06.592
And we're here toheck
on some things

05:06.626 --> 05:09.427
for the Dubois wedding
in two days.

05:09.461 --> 05:12.763
There we go.

05:12.797 --> 05:14.398
And what can I do you
for, young lady?

05:14.432 --> 05:16.399
Red... Oh, you want white wine?

05:16.433 --> 05:18.034
Maybe a little rosÃ©?

05:18.068 --> 05:20.870
I'm fine just
with water. Thank you.

05:20.905 --> 05:22.305
Well, don't hold back
on our account.

05:22.339 --> 05:24.708
I'm in the auto business,
young lady.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.009
We live by the maxim

05:26.043 --> 05:27.643
"Everything runs smoother
with a little lubrication."

05:27.678 --> 05:29.045
Dad, Dad, Dad,

05:29.079 --> 05:30.813
she just doesn't
feel like it.

05:30.847 --> 05:33.715
Stop trying to pour wine
down the poor girl's throat.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.950
All right, fine, fine.

05:35.984 --> 05:37.986
It's how I won you, darling.

05:41.455 --> 05:43.289
So, Allison, we were
very disappointed to hear

05:43.323 --> 05:44.990
that your family
won't be joining us.

05:45.024 --> 05:47.525
Oh, I know. I'm sorry, too.

05:47.559 --> 05:49.561
My mom and I...

05:51.397 --> 05:52.664
But it's fine.

05:52.698 --> 05:55.333
I sure at at some point
we'll all get to meet.

05:58.235 --> 06:01.804
This town is lovely.

06:01.838 --> 06:03.904
And the inn--

06:03.939 --> 06:05.840
it's so charming.

06:05.875 --> 06:08.609
"Charming." Code
for "old," right?

06:08.643 --> 06:11.945
I tell you, I tried to have
a shower when I got in here--

06:11.979 --> 06:14.080
the water pressure died
in about two minutes.

06:14.114 --> 06:16.649
The water pressure
in my room is just fine.

06:16.683 --> 06:20.151
You guys are in separate rooms?

06:20.186 --> 06:23.254
Well, we had to book this place
on such short notice, kiddo,

06:23.288 --> 06:26.156
and they didn't have
any king bs left, so...

06:26.190 --> 06:29.191
Yeah, two rooms.
It helps keep the peace.

06:29.226 --> 06:31.393
We'll live.

06:35.063 --> 06:38.599
So, um, my son tells me
that you're in law school.

06:38.633 --> 06:42.502
Uh, yeah, actually I go
to the School of Justice.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.170
It's kind of pre-law.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.238
Oh.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.639
Now how does that work?

06:46.673 --> 06:48.840
I mean, if you want
to have babies someday?

06:48.875 --> 06:51.943
I mean, to be a lawyer,
but then have babies--

06:51.978 --> 06:53.545
does that really make sense?

06:53.579 --> 06:54.846
Mom...
Hey, Marjori

06:54.880 --> 06:57.715
well, I mean,
don't you think...

07:12.561 --> 07:15.529
...it's what
good mothers do.

07:15.564 --> 07:18.498
Excuse me. I'm going to have
to excuse myself just a moment.

07:18.533 --> 07:19.866
You all right?

07:19.901 --> 07:21.267
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:21.302 --> 07:23.169
I'll be right back.

07:25.538 --> 07:27.139
What are you doing?

07:57.632 --> 07:59.533
They love you, by the way.

07:59.567 --> 08:01.134
When you were in the bathroom,

08:01.169 --> 08:02.869
they pretty much told me
they love you.

08:02.903 --> 08:04.704
The lawyer thing threw
my mother  first,

08:04.738 --> 08:07.540
but now that she met you,
she gets it.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.175
I had to lie

08:09.209 --> 08:12.777
and tell them that kids weren't
even on the menu for right now.

08:12.812 --> 08:14.045
I started to worry

08:14.080 --> 08:16.581
that maybe they
suspected something

08:16.615 --> 08:20.518
when you didn't want a drink,
but I think we got away with it.

08:20.553 --> 08:24.089
I could really use a drink
right about now.

08:24.123 --> 08:29.693
Oh, I understand.
I understand.

08:29.728 --> 08:31.362
I don't know how you did it.

08:31.396 --> 08:33.831
I don't know how you got
through that dinner sober.

08:33.865 --> 08:35.164
I had half a bottle of wine,

08:35.200 --> 08:37.734
and it was all I could do
to keep my ass in the seat

08:37.769 --> 08:39.169
and not run down
the nearest courthouse

08:39.203 --> 08:43.039
and change my name and
put myself up for adoption.

08:43.073 --> 08:45.108
Hey, hey, Mr. Science Guy,

08:45.143 --> 08:47.611
how much do you know
about hormones?

08:47.645 --> 08:49.113
Exse me?

08:49.147 --> 08:52.482
Well, it's not just
my dreams now.

08:52.516 --> 08:57.186
I'seeing things, hearing
things, even when I'm awake.

08:57.220 --> 09:00.522
What? What kind of things?

09:00.557 --> 09:03.192
Well, when I went
to the flower shop today,

09:03.226 --> 09:04.860
this woman came in.

09:04.894 --> 09:06.428
Her daughter was missing.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.430
She wanted to put
her picture up.

09:08.464 --> 09:13.902
And I saw her-- the daughter
right there, right then,

09:13.936 --> 09:15.370
being strangled to death.

09:15.404 --> 09:18.139
You saw her strangled
in the flower shop?

09:18.173 --> 09:20.107
No.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.143
It was in my head.

09:22.177 --> 09:25.646
It happened someplace else,
but...

09:25.680 --> 09:28.048
It was so vivid.
It was so specific.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.717
It was like...
like a little movie.

09:30.752 --> 09:32.419
What can that be?

09:33.254 --> 09:35.589
Empathy?

09:35.623 --> 09:37.991
Yeah, well, I saw her
again tonight--

09:38.025 --> 09:40.927
at the restaurant.

09:40.961 --> 09:44.630
Naked, dead,
in the bathroom mirror.

09:44.664 --> 09:47.166
Okay, I had the fish.
What did you have?

09:47.200 --> 09:49.101
I don't think
it was what I ate.

09:49.135 --> 09:51.370
Okay, maybe i's
something in the water.

09:51.404 --> 09:53.839
My parents are sleeping
in separate rooms.

09:53.873 --> 09:57.075
Something in the water
would explain a lot.

09:57.109 --> 09:59.744
That really hiyou,
didn't it?

09:59.779 --> 10:01.379
Well, yes and no.

10:01.413 --> 10:03.815
I meanI'm not a kid
living at home.

10:03.849 --> 10:06.384
And I know things haven't always
been great between them,

10:06.418 --> 10:09.320
but finding out
they're in different rooms

10:09.354 --> 10:12.056
two nights before
I get married...

10:12.090 --> 10:14.792
It kind of makes me sad.

10:14.826 --> 10:18.629
Oh, baby, let's fool around.

10:32.042 --> 10:33.109
Hi.

10:33.143 --> 10:35.344
Are you... are you looking
for my dad?

10:35.378 --> 10:38.112
Yeah. We're going to go
grab some dinner.

10:38.147 --> 10:41.048
Um...
Is he not here?

10:41.082 --> 10:43.283
Actually, no.

10:43.318 --> 10:46.119
He-he must have forgotten.
He went out to the movies.

10:46.153 --> 10:48.120
Do you want me
to try and call him?

10:48.155 --> 10:50.088
No, no, no, that's okay.

10:50.123 --> 10:52.224
I guess I'm lucky yo
came home when you did.

10:52.258 --> 10:54.959
Otherwise I'd be sting out
on the curb all night.

10:56.327 --> 10:58.795
It's been such a long time
since I've seen you.

10:58.830 --> 11:01.464
You're changing so much.

11:01.498 --> 11:04.033
Actually, I think I saw you,
like, four months ago.

11:04.067 --> 11:08.770
Well, even so, every time
I me visit,

11:08.804 --> 11:12.607
seems like you're even more
beautiful than the time before.

11:12.642 --> 11:15.943
Uh, thanks.

11:15.977 --> 11:18.311
You know, I've got
a little homework to do,

11:18.345 --> 11:20.245
so I, uh, I bett get inside.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.445
It was nice seeing you.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.980
So that's it?

11:23.014 --> 11:24.514
I drove all the way over here.

11:24.549 --> 11:26.950
You're not gonna even offer
me a glass of water?

11:29.453 --> 11:31.753
Actually, you know what?

11:31.788 --> 11:33.621
Don't worry. Forget the water.

11:33.656 --> 11:35.656
I don't need
to come inside.

11:35.690 --> 11:37.224
Not really.

11:37.258 --> 11:39.326
I could just take you with me.

11:48.936 --> 11:51.470
You okay?

11:51.504 --> 11:53.471
Is everything all right?

11:53.505 --> 11:54.938
Yeah. No.

11:54.972 --> 11:57.139
No, I had another dream.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.140
A bad dream.

11:58.174 --> 11:59.540
A really bad dream.

11:59.574 --> 12:00.941
Did you leave me again?

12:00.975 --> 12:02.175
No, you weren't there.

12:02.209 --> 12:03.142
It was a girl.

12:03.177 --> 12:05.344
The girl from town?

12:05.379 --> 12:06.445
The one who's missing?

12:06.480 --> 12:07.780
No, no, not her.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.615
Another girl, a teenage girl.

12:10.649 --> 12:12.417
A girl I've never seen before.

12:12.451 --> 12:14.218
Well, then come on.

12:14.253 --> 12:15.586
That was just a nightmare.

12:15.620 --> 12:16.820
Come on.

12:16.854 --> 12:18.887
Come on.
Let's go back to sleep.

12:18.922 --> 12:20.222
You just made her up.

12:20.256 --> 12:23.823
She's no one.

12:23.857 --> 12:25.456
Mmm...

12:34.326 --> 12:36.646
He went to play golf
with his father.

12:39.339 --> 12:40.739
Grandma Benoit.

12:50.331 --> 12:52.798
Stop looking so amazed.

12:52.832 --> 12:56.500
You've been seeing the dead
since you were six.

12:56.535 --> 13:01.138
, Grandma, when I was a little
girl, I had a very active...

13:01.172 --> 13:03.410
"...active imagination."

13:03.444 --> 13:06.084
I heard your mother
when she told you that,

13:06.118 --> 13:07.725
and I bit my tongue.

13:08.996 --> 13:13.807
You can ignore the ghosts
all you want.

13:13.808 --> 13:16.780
You can drink yourself

13:16.815 --> 13:19.587
You can igto the placests
where you can't see or hear,

13:19.621 --> 13:21.955
but that doesn't change the fact

13:21.956 --> 13:23.890
that they're reaching out
to you.

13:25.392 --> 13:29.629
You're seeing me now,
but that daren't you?ge the fact

13:29.663 --> 13:31.632
And I've been gone a long time.

13:31.666 --> 13:34.168
But this is a dream, Grandma.

13:34.202 --> 13:36.303
It's a nice dream...

13:36.337 --> 13:37.804
but it's dream.

13:37.839 --> 13:42.842
It's not a dream, and neither
was that girl you saw yesterday.

13:42.876 --> 13:46.713
She's de, Allison,
and no one knows.

13:46.747 --> 13:48.114
No one but you.

13:48.148 --> 13:50.783
And you're getting ready

13:50.817 --> 13:53.618
to have a child of your own.

13:53.653 --> 13:54.853
You think about it.

13:54.887 --> 13:58.422
One day you wake up
anthe child's gone.

13:58.456 --> 14:02.025
Someone knows what's happened,

14:02.060 --> 14:04.096
but they can't be bothered
to say anything,

14:04.130 --> 14:07.465
pick up the phone,
tell the police what they know.

14:09.168 --> 14:15.872
There's a reason
you see these things, Allison.

14:20.711 --> 14:22.111
Yeah.

14:22.145 --> 14:24.780
You ever considered
a prenuptial agreement?

14:24.814 --> 14:26.348
What?!

14:26.382 --> 14:29.017
No! Never.

14:29.051 --> 14:30.484
Well, maybe you should.

14:30.519 --> 14:34.621
Dad, I own two-thirds
of a used car.

14:34.655 --> 14:36.789
That's really not much
to fight over.

14:36.824 --> 14:39.458
Well, you don't have
that much now,

14:39.492 --> 14:40.726
but you're gonna
have more someday,

14:40.760 --> 14:42.060
and you need
to plan accordingly.

14:42.094 --> 14:43.294
Dad, come on.

14:43.328 --> 14:44.528
This is crazy.

14:44.563 --> 14:46.964
Allison and I don't have
that kind of relationship.

14:46.999 --> 14:47.865
Of course you don't.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.233
Nobody has that kind
of relationship

14:49.267 --> 14:50.367
when they start off.

14:50.401 --> 14:52.335
But after you've been
together for a while

14:52.370 --> 14:54.304
and saved up
some real scratch,

14:54.338 --> 14:56.339
who kns what kind of
relationship you'll have?

14:56.373 --> 14:58.574
You sure as hell can't
draw up a prenup then.

14:58.608 --> 15:01.010
Wow, you're quite the romantic,
aren't you?

15:01.044 --> 15:03.212
Look, I'm not saying
she's not a lovely girl,

15:03.246 --> 15:04.279
I'm not saying

15:04.313 --> 15:05.547
you're not gonna be
happy together,

15:05.581 --> 15:06.915
but you need
to be prepared.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.215
Oh, God.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.551
And once you say, "I do," '.

15:10.585 --> 15:11.785
Well, look at me.

15:11.819 --> 15:14.554
If I winup
in divorce court,

15:14.588 --> 15:16.956
your mother's gonna get half
of everything I got.

15:16.990 --> 15:18.223
What are you talking about?!

15:18.258 --> 15:19.791
Nobody's ending up
in divorce court:

15:19.826 --> 15:21.359
not you, not me.

15:21.394 --> 15:22.961
I don't like
this conversation.

15:22.995 --> 15:24.595
I'm getting married
tomorrow.

15:24.630 --> 15:26.363
I want you
to wish me luck.

15:26.398 --> 15:29.266
FineI wish you luck.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.334
And take it
from someone who knows,

15:31.368 --> 15:32.468
you're gonna need it.

15:32.503 --> 15:33.569
Oh, Dad, you know what?

15:33.604 --> 15:36.038
I love you,
but you're a jackass.

15:36.072 --> 15:37.506
Why is that?

15:37.540 --> 15:40.175
Because I'm trying to give you
the benefit of my experience?

15:40.209 --> 15:42.110
I have stood
where you're standing.

15:42.144 --> 15:44.012
The view is deceptive.

15:44.046 --> 15:45.146
It doesn't hold up.

15:45.180 --> 15:46.647
Really? And how
would you know that?

15:46.681 --> 15:48.048
You come tmy wedding,

15:48.082 --> 15:49.649
and you and Mom
get separate rooms.

15:49.683 --> 15:50.783
I mean, what is that?

15:50.818 --> 15:55.388
Oh, for crying out loud,
Joe, wise up, will you?

15:55.423 --> 15:58.491
We goteparate rooms
because we lead separate lives.

15:59.993 --> 16:03.428
I've been out of the house
for about three months.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.097
Your mom didn't want
to tell you

16:06.132 --> 16:07.232
till after
the wedding.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.533
And you got to promise
not to let on.

16:09.568 --> 16:12.769
What? What happened?

16:12.804 --> 16:14.871
Nothing happened.

16:15.286 --> 16:16.406
Marriage happened.

16:17.608 --> 16:19.608
Come on. Let's play.d.

16:19.643 --> 16:22.377
You know what?
I don't...

16:22.412 --> 16:24.178
I don't feel like playing.

16:24.213 --> 16:26.983
Oh, wait a minute.

16:27.017 --> 16:30.486
Oh, don't do that. Joe!

16:47.902 --> 16:48.935
I'm sorry.

16:48.969 --> 16:51.070
I gotta get in there.
It's my room.

16:51.104 --> 16:52.805
I'm sorry.
There's a detective in there

16:52.839 --> 16:53.806
conducting an interview.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.574
An interview?

16:57.376 --> 17:00.078
Thanks for your time,dy in there
Miss Rolen.      but my fiancÃ©e.

17:04.583 --> 17:06.818
Hi.

17:15.226 --> 17:17.627
I called the police.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.464
Yeah, I figured somebody did.

17:22.467 --> 17:25.167
I didn't know they were gna
come over here.

17:25.202 --> 17:27.837
I told them that I knew
that girl was dead.

17:27.871 --> 17:28.938
The one from town?

17:28.972 --> 17:30.639
e one that you said
you saw last night?

17:30.673 --> 17:33.741
I just kept thinking
about her mother,

17:33.775 --> 17:36.176
about her not knowing.

17:36.210 --> 17:38.111
u don't actually
know anything.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.645
It's not like, you know,
you-you really saw something.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.880
I saw her being strangled.

17:42.915 --> 17:44.048
Yeah, in your head.

17:44.082 --> 17:45.482
That's not the same
as really seeing.

17:45.517 --> 17:48.918
Yeah, that's what
that detective kept saying.

17:48.953 --> 17:51.153
I-I don't understand.

17:51.188 --> 17:54.623
Wha-what was it that
you were hoping to accomplish

17:54.657 --> 17:55.791
by calling the police?

17:59.795 --> 18:04.532
Grandma Benoit... told me

18:04.566 --> 18:06.900
that I was seeing these things
for a reason.

18:06.935 --> 18:11.304
Grandma Benoit?

18:11.338 --> 18:14.339
But didn't you say that
she-she died years ago?

18:21.212 --> 18:24.314
Are you having second thoughts
about this marriage?

18:24.348 --> 18:28.184
Have you been...
have you been talking to my dad?

18:28.219 --> 18:30.687
Your dad doesn't think
you should marry me either?

18:30.721 --> 18:33.222
Well, my dad doesn't think
anyone should marry anyone.

18:33.257 --> 18:36.725
Turns out he and my mom
have been separated for months.

18:36.759 --> 18:39.160
He didn't want to tell anyone.

18:39.195 --> 18:40.995
He didn't... he didn't want
to ruin the wedding.

18:41.029 --> 18:44.197
Oh, smart, but he told you.

18:48.868 --> 18:52.970
It's gotta be hard
to be Joe Dubois today, huh?

18:53.005 --> 18:54.739
You have no idea.

18:57.042 --> 18:59.243
Hey, don't forget.

18:59.278 --> 19:01.479
Tonight, after
the rehearsal dinner,

19:01.513 --> 19:04.615
you gotta move out
'cause the bride sleeps alone.

19:04.650 --> 19:06.451
That's a barbaric
tradition.

19:09.221 --> 19:13.124
We can do anything we want
before the rehearsal dinner.

19:13.158 --> 19:14.659
That's five whole hours.

19:14.693 --> 19:17.528
Now that's a very enlightened
tradition.

19:17.562 --> 19:19.463
That's a tradition
I can get behind.

19:19.497 --> 19:20.531
Mmm.

19:20.565 --> 19:23.500
And in answer to yr
earlier question:

19:23.534 --> 19:25.902
yes, I'm leaning
towards going ahead

19:25.937 --> 19:27.237
with the wedding.

19:27.271 --> 19:28.739
Ah, you're leaning?

19:28.773 --> 19:30.474
Yeah, it's looking good.

19:31.743 --> 19:34.177
Shut up and take
your clothes off.

19:44.655 --> 19:46.923
Good morning.

19:46.958 --> 19:49.693
You probably have
a bit of a headache.

19:49.727 --> 19:52.662
And I'm sure
your throat is pretty sore

19:52.697 --> 19:57.300
from all the screaming
you did last night.

20:03.407 --> 20:05.308
Where am I?

20:05.342 --> 20:07.076
You've turned into

20:07.111 --> 20:09.879
a really beautiful
young woman.

20:09.913 --> 20:12.948
And watching you grow up
has been one

20:12.982 --> 20:14.716
of the great joys
in my life.

20:15.919 --> 20:19.020
Can we talk
about this neck?

20:19.055 --> 20:21.690
I mean, how long
and slender it is?

20:24.160 --> 20:26.528
What are you doing?!

20:26.562 --> 20:28.396
Relax.

20:28.431 --> 20:31.766
You're gonna enjoy this.

20:41.942 --> 20:43.710
Uh!
Whoa!

20:43.745 --> 20:45.445
What the hell's
ing on?

20:45.479 --> 20:47.447
You okay, huh?

20:47.481 --> 20:49.182
Babe, you okay?

20:49.216 --> 20:50.216
Yeah, I'm fine.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.784
We're fine.

20:51.819 --> 20:53.552
Just a bad dam.

20:53.587 --> 20:55.220
Just another bad dream.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.189
This man I'd never seen before
was doing this horrible thing

20:58.223 --> 21:01.291
to this girl
I'd never seen before.

21:01.325 --> 21:03.191
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

21:03.226 --> 21:04.993
Oh, God, it's okay.

21:05.027 --> 21:06.126
We gotta get up.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.895
The rehearsal dinner starts
in, li, an hour.

21:08.929 --> 21:10.563
Is this thing on?

21:10.597 --> 21:13.431
I'd like to start off

21:13.466 --> 21:17.298
by welcoming all the out-of-town
guests tonight.

21:17.332 --> 21:19.532
And I guess that's everybody,
right?

21:22.799 --> 21:26.095
Well, truthfully, I don't know
my future daughter-in-law

21:26.128 --> 21:28.393
very well... yet,

21:28.428 --> 21:30.393
but I'd like to think
I know my boy,

21:30.427 --> 21:31.961
and I can tell you ts:

21:31.995 --> 21:37.829
he is absolutely <i>crazy</i>
about the girl.

21:38.830 --> 21:39.829
Whoo!
Whoo!

21:39.864 --> 21:41.964
Yeah!
Whoo!

21:41.998 --> 21:44.032
My Joey loves you, young lady.

21:44.066 --> 21:45.731
Which means that even though

21:45.765 --> 21:48.998
we haven't spent much time
together yet,

21:49.032 --> 21:51.366
we're family.

21:53.703 --> 21:56.570
So, can somebody
get this microphone

21:56.605 --> 21:58.605
out of my hands?

22:00.074 --> 22:01.507
Who wants to say something?

22:01.542 --> 22:05.711
All right, I guess
I'll keep him.
You, yeah, you.

22:05.745 --> 22:08.647
Come on up. You say something.
Here we go.

22:08.681 --> 22:10.081
Yeah, Andy.

22:10.116 --> 22:12.516
Okay, wow.

22:12.551 --> 22:15.119
I hadn't really planned
on saying anything.

22:15.154 --> 22:19.289
So, Joe, Allison...

22:19.324 --> 22:22.458
I guess your first question
is probly...

22:22.493 --> 22:24.193
who am I?

22:25.996 --> 22:28.229
Joe, the last time you saw me,

22:28.264 --> 22:30.731
I think we were playing
Chewbacca and Han Solo

22:30.766 --> 22:32.032
in my folks' basement.

22:33.901 --> 22:37.270
I'm your second cousin,
Andy Seward.

22:37.304 --> 22:39.405
I mean, second cousin
by marriage.

22:42.376 --> 22:44.410
And really, what's
a rehearsal dinner

22:44.445 --> 22:46.645
without some remarks
from a second cousin

22:46.680 --> 22:48.714
by marriage, right?

22:51.138 --> 22:52.405
So wait a second.

22:52.439 --> 22:54.607
You're telling me
my cousin Andy is a murderer?

22:54.641 --> 22:55.607
He's the man I've been
seeing in my dreams, yes.

22:55.642 --> 22:56.642
I'm trying to tell you.

22:56.676 --> 22:57.709
I'm sorry. That is what
I'm trying to tell you.

22:57.743 --> 22:58.777
He's the man I've been
seeing in my dreams, yes.

23:00.512 --> 23:01.545
He's the manYou'e been
rey medelir?So wait a second.

23:01.580 --> 23:02.613
You're telling me
my cousin Andy is a murderer?

23:02.647 --> 23:03.647
He's the man I've been
seeing in my dreams, yes.

23:03.682 --> 23:04.581
I'm sorry. That is what
I'm trying to tell you.

23:04.616 --> 23:05.349
What I wouldn't do
for a cigarette or a drink

23:05.416 --> 23:07.551
or a d'rmakes no sense.

23:07.585 --> 23:09.787
I can't do anything about that.

23:09.821 --> 23:11.621
That's him.

23:11.655 --> 23:14.623
I mean, in my dreams
he looks older,

23:14.658 --> 23:17.159
soaybe he's not
a murderer yet.

23:17.193 --> 23:18.760
But it's definitely him.

23:18.794 --> 23:20.962
This is defitely something
he's going to do.

23:20.996 --> 23:22.896
What do you want me
to do about it?

23:22.931 --> 23:24.965
I mean call the future police

23:25.000 --> 23:26.533
or hop in a time machine
or something

23:26.567 --> 23:28.869
and stop this murder that you
dreamed about from happening?

23:28.903 --> 23:32.171
How about I just go in there
and punch him in the nose?

23:32.205 --> 23:34.006
That wouldn't cast
too big a pall

23:34.040 --> 23:35.507
on the proceedings,
would it?

23:35.541 --> 23:37.843
Oh, that's right,
I almost forgot:

23:37.877 --> 23:39.477
we're supposed to get married.

23:39.512 --> 23:43.547
And instead, we both just walked
out of our rehearsal dinner,

23:43.582 --> 23:45.215
stand out here
by the garbage

23:45.249 --> 23:47.283
and have a chat about
my second cousin by marriage,

23:47.317 --> 23:48.317
the high school
chemistry teacher

23:48.351 --> 23:50.218
who you think might be
Jack the Ripper

23:50.252 --> 23:51.986
in the 21st century.

23:52.021 --> 23:53.287
Are you mocking me?

23:53.321 --> 23:55.354
No, t I think
you're mocking us.

23:55.389 --> 23:58.090
Or at least you're doing
your damndest to kill this thing

23:58.125 --> 24:01.159
before it even
gets started.

24:01.193 --> 24:03.027
I don't know
what's going on with you

24:03.062 --> 24:05.230
the past couple days, Allison.

24:05.265 --> 24:07.099
This is nuts.

24:07.134 --> 24:08.834
I want to rry you.

24:08.869 --> 24:11.070
Do you still want
to marry me?

24:11.104 --> 24:12.838
Of course I do.

24:12.872 --> 24:14.573
Okay.

24:14.607 --> 24:17.308
Then that is the here and now.

24:17.343 --> 24:20.177
All this other stuff, this dream
stuff, this fure stuff,

24:20.211 --> 24:23.247
I am not dealing with it,
not now, not tonight.

24:23.281 --> 24:26.183
And you shouldn't be eithe

24:43.098 --> 24:45.032
Come on. Let's
go back inside.

24:45.066 --> 24:47.533
Are you sure?

24:47.568 --> 24:50.501
No matter what else I say,

24:50.536 --> 24:53.870
no matter what else I do,

24:53.905 --> 24:57.375
you are my here and now, Joe.

24:57.409 --> 25:00.444
You are my always
and forever.

25:02.580 --> 25:05.281
Please.

25:16.423 --> 25:19.658
Joe...

25:19.693 --> 25:22.127
Any luck reaching Allison?

25:22.161 --> 25:24.962
Yeah, she just called
me back finally.

25:24.997 --> 25:27.935
In the car on the way over here.

25:27.970 --> 25:30.171
She's, uh, she's flying in.

25:30.205 --> 25:32.340
She's going to be here tonight.

25:32.407 --> 25:34.442
There's not that many flights
from Dallas.

25:38.379 --> 25:41.180
HI don't think she believes it.

25:41.214 --> 25:44.015
It's not like she said
she was giving up.

25:44.050 --> 25:46.583
Not like she said
that she was moving back.

25:46.651 --> 25:49.118
She's going to want
to see it for herself.

25:49.153 --> 25:52.855
I never understood it.

25:52.889 --> 25:54.589
We must have gotten
300, 400ips.

25:54.624 --> 25:56.492
Why that one?
Why Texas?

25:56.526 --> 25:58.493
Well, you
know Allison.

25:58.527 --> 26:03.096
When she heard somebody
saw our little daughter...

26:05.166 --> 26:06.666
getting into a car in Plano,

26:06.701 --> 26:12.072
she just knew, and there was
no convincing her otherwise.

26:12.106 --> 26:14.942
Seven months.

26:14.977 --> 26:18.278
Seven months living
in a hotel room.

26:18.313 --> 26:20.413
Just knocking on doors

26:20.448 --> 26:23.116
and showing her picture
to strangers.

26:23.150 --> 26:26.086
I don't know how she does it.

26:27.088 --> 26:29.822
So let's get this over with,
okay?

26:32.092 --> 26:33.358
I got to warn you, Joe,

26:33.393 --> 26:35.794
she was in that hole
for an awfully long time.

27:03.486 --> 27:05.887
That bracelet...

27:08.590 --> 27:13.126
Allison and I gave her that
for her 16th birthday.

27:16.263 --> 27:20.165
That's her.

27:20.199 --> 27:22.200
That's our daughter.

27:38.712 --> 27:41.813
Come on, tell me
you're happy for me.

27:41.848 --> 27:43.115
I am.

27:43.149 --> 27:45.483
I'm extremely happy for you.

27:45.518 --> 27:50.121
I'm just maybe a little
sad for myself.

27:52.657 --> 27:54.858
But it's a good sadness.

28:00.530 --> 28:02.464
It's the same sadness
that I felt

28:02.499 --> 28:04.532
when you went off
to college,

28:04.567 --> 28:07.835
and when you moved
to Phoenix.

28:09.604 --> 28:11.605
Just beten us,
I think I might be

28:11.639 --> 28:15.908
just a tiny bit jeous
of your wife-to-be.

28:15.942 --> 28:17.142
But I'll get over it.

28:18.511 --> 28:21.946
Hey, kid, I just got a message
from the maid of honor.

28:21.980 --> 28:24.147
Your fncÃ©e would like
a rd with you.

28:25.683 --> 28:27.350
ck at the inn.

28:27.384 --> 28:29.586
What do you mean,
back at the inn?

28:29.620 --> 28:31.321
Allison's not here?

28:35.725 --> 28:38.660
You're not even dresd yet.

28:38.694 --> 28:40.928
Everyone's waiting.

28:40.963 --> 28:44.231
Joe, the girl
I've been dreaming about--

28:44.265 --> 28:48.067
e one your cousin strangles--

28:48.102 --> 28:50.202
she's r daughter, Joe.

28:50.237 --> 28:52.404
We don't have a daughter.
I mean, not yet.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.639
But we will.

28:54.674 --> 28:56.941
And your cousin is going
to murder her.

28:57.743 --> 29:02.346
Okay. And you know this
because...?

29:02.380 --> 29:03.880
Because I saw it.

29:03.915 --> 29:05.949
I saw it in my dreams.

29:08.719 --> 29:11.920
When is this going to happen?

29:11.955 --> 29:13.655
I mean, in your dreams.

29:13.689 --> 29:15.790
A year from now,
two years, three years?

29:15.824 --> 29:17.425
No, she's a teenager.

29:17.459 --> 29:19.193
She's a young woman.

29:19.227 --> 29:24.030
So we're talking like 16, 17, 18
years from now maybe?

29:24.065 --> 29:26.065
'Cause I keep thinking
about the 85 people

29:26.100 --> 29:27.933
who are sitting there
on that golf course

29:27.968 --> 29:29.268
waiting for us right now.

29:29.302 --> 29:31.436
I don't know what to tell you.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.270
I don't know
what to say to them.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.938
I can't go through with this.

29:34.973 --> 29:36.807
Because of these dreams--

29:36.841 --> 29:38.608
that take place
a couple decades from now?

29:38.643 --> 29:42.111
Look, I know it sounds
ridiculous,

29:42.146 --> 29:45.114
but all these horrible
things that I'm seeing

29:45.148 --> 29:47.716
take place in a world
whe we're married.

29:47.750 --> 29:52.353
I can't help but think,
maybe if we don't get married.

29:52.387 --> 29:55.489
Maybe if I just raise
this baby on my own.

29:55.523 --> 29:56.890
Tell me you love me.

29:56.958 --> 29:57.991
I love you.

29:58.025 --> 29:59.192
This isn't about that?

29:59.226 --> 30:01.127
Honey, it's not about that.

30:01.161 --> 30:02.595
Okay, then mar me.

30:02.629 --> 30:04.763
'Cause none of the rest
of it matters.

30:04.798 --> 30:06.431
How can you say that?

30:06.466 --> 30:09.200
Because I know it to be true.

30:09.235 --> 30:11.002
As a scientist, as a physicist,

30:11.036 --> 30:14.004
as a person who studies
the physical facts of the world,

30:14.039 --> 30:15.606
I'm telling you, Allison,

30:15.640 --> 30:18.308
these things that you dream
arjust that: dreams.

30:18.342 --> 30:19.642
No.

30:19.677 --> 30:21.277
Yes.

30:21.312 --> 30:24.113
Don't you see your fear
is based on your certainty

30:24.147 --> 30:26.648
at these things are going
to happen?

30:26.682 --> 30:29.417
Whereas the one thing
that centuries of science

30:29.451 --> 30:32.019
have taught us, is that
the only thing that's certain

30:32.054 --> 30:34.021
is that nothing is for certain.

30:34.055 --> 30:35.155
You don't believe me.

30:35.190 --> 30:37.023
I completely believe you.

30:37.058 --> 30:40.726
You say you see these things,
I believe you see these things.

30:40.761 --> 30:44.029
I just know that
none of it matters... yet.

30:44.063 --> 30:47.198
The things that you're seeing,
Allison, they could happen,

30:47.232 --> 30:48.966
but they don't have to happen.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.367
Life is not like that.

30:50.401 --> 30:52.969
Life is much more complicated
than that.

30:53.003 --> 30:55.737
We're not hurtling down
a predetermined path

30:55.772 --> 30:58.206
towards a foregone conclusion.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.974
We people, all of us, we make...

31:00.008 --> 31:03.076
we make thousands
of decisions a day--

31:03.111 --> 31:05.145
little ones, tiny ones--
turn left, turn right.

31:05.179 --> 31:08.114
I will have that drink.
I won't lie to that girl.

31:08.148 --> 31:10.149
I will take my child's hand.

31:10.184 --> 31:12.351
I don't have to save
for a rainy day.

31:12.385 --> 31:16.121
You take all those choices times
all the people in the rld,

31:16.156 --> 31:17.656
including the ones not yet born,

31:17.690 --> 31:20.959
and you have to conclude
the future is not set.

31:20.993 --> 31:22.326
It can't be.

31:22.361 --> 31:24.762
And that's the best part
about being alive.

31:24.796 --> 31:27.932
It's always new.
It's always surprising.

31:27.967 --> 31:30.334
Now, I'm willing
to take my chances

31:30.369 --> 31:32.903
that our future is going
to be a great one--

31:32.938 --> 31:37.340
for you, for me, for that
little child inside of you.

31:37.375 --> 31:40.043
So come on. Put on your dress.

31:40.077 --> 31:42.244
Our future's waiting.

31:44.614 --> 31:46.548
I can't.

31:49.218 --> 31:51.652
I can't.
I know that you're right.

31:51.686 --> 31:55.755
I know these things that
I'm seeing might not happen,

31:55.790 --> 31:58.124
but they might.

31:58.159 --> 32:01.894
And that "might" is too much
for me to live with.

32:05.431 --> 32:11.435
I can't even put into words
how sorry I am, Joe,

32:11.469 --> 32:13.704
but I can't may you..

32:13.738 --> 32:16.706
not today...

32:16.740 --> 32:19.208
not ever.

32:32.134 --> 32:33.534
GRANDMA BENOIT:
Just wanted
to stop back,

32:35.202 --> 32:38.535
tell you how much
I like your intended.

32:38.579 --> 32:40.046
I think he's terrific.

32:41.159 --> 32:42.125
I like the way he thinks.

32:42.160 --> 32:45.194
I-I like what he stands for.

32:45.666 --> 32:49.001
What are you tking about,
Grandma?

32:49.035 --> 32:51.036
I'm not getting married.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.270
The wedding is off.

32:52.305 --> 32:55.173
I don't understand.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.610
You told me to believe
in the things I see...

32:58.644 --> 33:02.813
that I see the things I do
for a reason.

33:04.349 --> 33:05.548
Just a second!

33:22.763 --> 33:24.529
I came for Joe's things.

33:24.564 --> 33:27.899
Marjorie, I feel awful
about this whole thing.

33:35.972 --> 33:39.040
Maybe when you get a moment,

33:39.075 --> 33:41.576
you could pull
his things together

33:41.610 --> 33:43.878
and pack them in his bag.

33:43.912 --> 33:46.180
I'll-I'll send a bellman.

33:47.448 --> 33:51.084
My husband is on the phone
right now calling the airlines

33:51.118 --> 33:53.452
trying to see
if we can all get out of here

33:53.487 --> 33:54.853
a day early, but it's hard

33:54.888 --> 33:56.854
to get sometng done
on a Sunday.

33:56.889 --> 33:58.856
I love him.

33:58.890 --> 34:01.291
You need to know I love him.

34:01.325 --> 34:04.059
I know you broke his heart.

34:04.093 --> 34:08.462
And that's really all
I need to know.

34:10.297 --> 34:14.165
Allison, marriage isn't just
an act of love.

34:14.199 --> 34:15.500
It's an act of will.

34:15.534 --> 34:17.500
And  you can't even muster
up the will

34:17.534 --> 34:19.101
to make it to the ceremony,

34:19.135 --> 34:22.036
then this is probably best
for all of us.

34:30.313 --> 34:32.849
You want some?

34:32.882 --> 34:35.851
'Cause there's about 79 more
where it came from, huh?

34:35.886 --> 34:37.255
Come on.

34:37.290 --> 34:39.190
Have a bite.

34:39.225 --> 34:40.324
Are you serious?

34:40.360 --> 34:43.960
Look, kiddo, you just got left
at the altar.

34:43.996 --> 34:47.496
You have the rt of your life
to-to stew about that.

34:47.532 --> 34:49.998
Right now there's...
there's od food,

34:50.034 --> 34:50.967
there's good drink,

34:51.001 --> 34:52.969
and it cost me
an arm and a leg,

34:53.003 --> 34:55.638
so I say come on,
let's try and enjoy it.

34:55.672 --> 34:57.739
Hmm?

34:57.774 --> 35:01.209
Uh, sir, I'm gonna pack up
my stuff, so...

35:01.243 --> 35:02.510
Pack up?

35:02.544 --> 35:04.778
I paid you to work
for five hours.

35:04.813 --> 35:06.647
You want your tip?

35:06.681 --> 35:07.848
Of course, sir.
Good.

35:07.882 --> 35:09.216
Get over there
and play sething.

35:09.250 --> 35:10.517
What do you
want to hear?

35:10.551 --> 35:13.152
Uh, I don't want
to hear anything.

35:13.186 --> 35:15.821
So, my son is sad.

35:15.855 --> 35:17.990
Why don't you play
something happy?

35:20.827 --> 35:22.694
Any luck with the airline?

35:22.728 --> 35:24.596
Uh. None at all.

35:24.630 --> 35:26.530
I'm afraid we're all here
for the duration.

35:26.565 --> 35:28.198
Nobody goes anywhere
until Monday afternoon.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.467
Oh, boy, just the three of us.

35:31.501 --> 35:35.938
âª âª

35:35.973 --> 35:37.606
Fantastic.

35:37.641 --> 35:39.608
What the hell's the matter
with that kid?

35:39.642 --> 35:41.143
I asked for
something happy.

35:44.381 --> 35:48.616
You went to see her,
didn't you?

35:48.651 --> 35:52.620
You just couldn't
help yourself?

35:52.654 --> 35:55.722
How is she?

35:55.757 --> 35:58.090
Does it matter?

35:59.726 --> 36:02.961
Upset.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.829
She told me she loves you.

36:04.863 --> 36:08.730
âª âª

36:10.533 --> 36:12.500
This? Really?

36:12.534 --> 36:15.635
What? He's not gonna hear
his wedding song today.

36:15.670 --> 36:17.570
We might as well
hear ours.

36:17.604 --> 36:20.205
Come on, Marjie.

36:20.239 --> 36:21.706
I'll let you lead, huh?

36:21.740 --> 36:25.610
No, I-I don't really think
this is a very good idea.
Aw...

36:25.644 --> 36:27.944
If the's not
gonna be a wedding,

36:27.979 --> 36:29.746
I-I have to change
my shoes.

36:29.780 --> 36:33.682
âª âª

36:33.717 --> 36:36.851
Well, I gave it
the old college try.

36:36.886 --> 36:38.252
She's hurting, Dad.

36:38.287 --> 36:43.023
I think she's had all the pain
she can handle for today.

36:43.057 --> 36:44.224
It's sad.

36:44.258 --> 36:46.059
You two really did
love each other.

36:46.093 --> 36:48.661
Oh, I think we still do.

36:48.695 --> 36:50.863
I love <i>her</i> anyway.

36:50.897 --> 36:52.865
Then what happened?

36:52.899 --> 36:59.370
Well, the problem, I suppose,
is the <i>way</i> I love her.

36:59.404 --> 37:01.205
It's, uh, I don't know.

37:01.239 --> 37:03.407
It's more the big picture way,
not...

37:03.441 --> 37:05.442
you know, the day-to-day way.

37:05.476 --> 37:08.778
And 27 years of marriage...

37:08.812 --> 37:10.379
That's a lot of days.

37:10.413 --> 37:13.649
Sure is.

37:17.686 --> 37:20.454
It's my own damn fault.

37:23.892 --> 37:26.926
REPORTER
Democratic presidential nominee
Bill Clinton

37:26.961 --> 37:28.027
promised that an announcement

37:28.095 --> 37:30.596
on his list of
vice presidential candidates

37:30.631 --> 37:32.665
would be coming
within the week.

37:32.699 --> 37:36.534
Campaign manager James Carville
said that among....

38:15.665 --> 38:18.366
"She drove off
in her little blue car,

38:18.400 --> 38:21.335
and no one's seen her since."

38:21.370 --> 38:23.937
<i>Space Q7...</i>

38:23.972 --> 38:27.040
<i>San Luis Obispo Airport.</i>

38:35.315 --> 38:39.417
Hello. Is this
the San Luis Obispo police?

38:39.452 --> 38:41.919
I have some informion

38:41.954 --> 38:44.855
about the missing girl
Julie Pinsley,

38:44.890 --> 38:48.525
some very specific information.

38:52.029 --> 38:53.329
Hello?

38:54.498 --> 38:56.265
Who is it?

38:59.502 --> 39:01.602
Hello?!

39:06.541 --> 39:08.775
You know what?
You were right.

39:08.810 --> 39:11.745
We're not hurtling down
a predetermined path

39:11.779 --> 39:14.414
towards a foregone conclusion.

39:14.448 --> 39:17.650
That's the best part
about being alive.

39:17.684 --> 39:19.952
Okay.

39:20.020 --> 39:25.090
The police found
that missing girl.

39:25.125 --> 39:27.292
She <i>was</i> dead...

39:27.327 --> 39:29.528
in the trunk of her own car.

39:29.562 --> 39:33.331
And that...
and that changes things?

39:33.365 --> 39:35.532
Well, it does for me.

39:35.567 --> 39:38.101
It means that everything that
you were telling me yesterday,

39:38.136 --> 39:39.936
I should have listened.

39:39.971 --> 39:44.974
Joe, I think you're the smartest
man I've ever met in my life.

39:45.009 --> 39:46.776
Okay, wait a second.
Wait a second.

39:46.811 --> 39:48.411
What about our child?

39:48.446 --> 39:50.079
What about my cousin?

39:50.114 --> 39:51.948
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

39:51.982 --> 39:53.215
I think after tonight,

39:53.250 --> 39:57.786
we don't have to worry
about that anymore.

39:57.821 --> 40:00.389
Don't ask me how I know that...

40:00.423 --> 40:02.023
but I do.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.796
Okay, if you say so.

40:08.864 --> 40:11.332
No, no, wait.

40:11.366 --> 40:13.066
Listen...

40:13.101 --> 40:14.668
I really don't want
to leave here

40:14.702 --> 40:17.101
without doing
what we came here to do.

40:17.136 --> 40:20.037
I know it's been

40:20.071 --> 40:22.105
a crazy few days.

40:22.139 --> 40:24.072
I know everybody's heading home.

40:24.106 --> 40:27.440
I know tomorrow's a Monday.

40:27.474 --> 40:31.775
I know that there's
a thousand reasons to say no.

40:34.978 --> 40:37.880
But please...

40:37.914 --> 40:40.248
Joe Dubois...

40:40.283 --> 40:41.983
is there any chance

40:42.018 --> 40:44.352
that Ian convince you
to marry me?

41:24.952 --> 41:29.088
âª âª

41:29.122 --> 41:32.257
By the pers granted to me
by the state of California,

41:41.165 --> 41:43.766
Oh, hell, Joey,
go ahead and kiss her.

41:43.801 --> 41:47.203

42:00.417 --> 42:01.717
Where is this? This place

42:01.751 --> 42:03.151
where you and Mommy
got married?

42:03.185 --> 42:07.590
Uh, California,
a place call San Luis Obispo.

42:07.624 --> 42:09.759
You and Mommy both lived here
in Phoenix, right?

42:09.793 --> 42:12.027
Why'd you have to go
all the way out there

42:12.061 --> 42:13.528
to get married?

42:13.563 --> 42:15.864
You know, I can't
remember why,

42:15.898 --> 42:18.132
but it turned out
to be the perfect spot.

42:18.167 --> 42:20.267
Yeah...

42:21.870 --> 42:23.704
It sure did.
