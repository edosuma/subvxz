11:13.343 --> 11:16.006
AND YOU GOTTA WORK TWO JOBS
JUST TO KEEP FOOD ON THE TABLE,

11:16.006 --> 11:17.808
I WILL SAY
WHATEVER I WANT.

11:17.808 --> 11:19.349
DROP IT!

11:19.349 --> 11:22.352
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD GO
TO THAT FUNERAL, HUH?

11:22.352 --> 11:24.054
I WANT TO BE
A WOMAN OF MY WORD,

11:24.054 --> 11:25.986
AND I ALWAYS TOLD HIM
THAT I WOULD DANCE ON HIS GRAVE.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.388
NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY
THEY´LL DO IT BUT THEY DON´T.

11:28.388 --> 11:32.092
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.994
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
GEORGE?

11:33.994 --> 11:34.995
I DIDN´T KILL HIM.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.366
YOU DID TO ME.

11:36.366 --> 11:38.128
IF YOU HADN´T LIED
AND TOLD ME HE WAS DEAD,

11:38.128 --> 11:39.699
I COULD HAVE FOUND HIM
YEARS AGO.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.371
I COULD HAVE GOTTEN
TO KNOW HIM.

11:41.371 --> 11:43.373
I COULD HAVE HAD A REAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.

11:43.373 --> 11:45.205
HE KNEW YOU WEREN´T DEAD,

11:45.205 --> 11:47.277
BUT HE DIDN´T COME
RUSHING BACK TO FIND YOU!

11:47.277 --> 11:49.239
YEAH, BECAUSE
YOU WERE THERE!

11:52.412 --> 11:54.845
YOU KNOW, I USED TO FEEL BAD
THAT HE WALKED OUT ON YOU.

11:54.845 --> 11:57.717
NOW I FEEL BAD
HE DIDN´T TAKE ME WITH HIM.

11:59.790 --> 12:01.992
Psst!

12:01.992 --> 12:03.723
Just so you know,

12:03.723 --> 12:06.056
I´m missing
a band-aid I had

12:06.056 --> 12:09.299
before
I made the guacamole.

12:09.299 --> 12:12.462
AY DIOS! QUE ES ESTO
EN MI GUACAMOLE?

12:16.736 --> 12:20.010
MAX, CAN YOU COME DOWN HERE?

12:20.010 --> 12:21.441
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
HONEY?

12:21.441 --> 12:23.413
WELL,
THEY MIGHT ASK PEOPLE

12:23.413 --> 12:25.245
TO SAY A FEW WORDS
AT THE FUNERAL,

12:25.245 --> 12:27.517
SO I´M JUST WRITING DOWN
SOME THOUGHTS.

12:27.517 --> 12:29.749
YOU WANT TO RUN THEM
BY ME?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.381
OKAY.

12:34.825 --> 12:36.426
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW,

12:36.426 --> 12:39.189
MY DAD MEANT A LOT
TO PEOPLE --

12:39.189 --> 12:42.032
NOT JUST AS A HUSBAND
AND A FATHER,

12:42.032 --> 12:43.834
BUT AS...

12:43.834 --> 12:47.397
"...A LICENSED AND BONDED
CONTRACTOR IN THE PHOENIX AREA

12:47.397 --> 12:49.539
FOR OVER 25 YEARS."

12:55.045 --> 12:56.947
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:56.947 --> 12:58.849
ANGIE, I GOT NOTHIN´.

12:58.849 --> 13:01.311
I MEAN, I PUNCHED HIM,
HE THREW ME IN JAIL.

13:01.311 --> 13:03.153
I OFFERED HIM MY KIDNEY --
HE DIED.

13:03.153 --> 13:04.955
THAT´S, LIKE, 5 SECONDS.

13:04.955 --> 13:08.788
SO I´M GETTING SOME MORE STUFF
OFF HIS COMPANY´S WEBSITE.

13:08.788 --> 13:13.023
MY FATHER DIDN´T
JUST LOVE PEOPLE.

13:13.023 --> 13:15.065
HE...

13:15.065 --> 13:17.427
"...LOVED BEATING
ANY WRITTEN ESTIMATE."

13:19.429 --> 13:21.571
"EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
EMPLOYER..."

13:21.571 --> 13:25.275
ALSO, "HABLABA ESPAñOL."

13:29.079 --> 13:31.241
MAX, GRANDMA´S GONNA WATCH YOU
WHILE WE´RE IN PHOENIX.

13:31.241 --> 13:33.083
YOU REMEMBER
THE GROUND RULES, RIGHT?

13:33.083 --> 13:35.045
IF SHE FALLS ASLEEP
IN FRONT OF THE TV...

13:35.045 --> 13:38.448
...MAKE SURE
HER CIGARETTE IS OUT.

13:38.448 --> 13:40.820
AND IF SHE DRINKS MORE
THAN A 6-PACK...

13:40.820 --> 13:42.953
...LAY HER ON HER SIDE.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.831
AND SHE´S NOT SUPPOSED TO,

13:51.831 --> 13:54.965
BUT IF SHE BRINGS OVER
HER BOYFRIEND, RANDY...

13:54.965 --> 13:57.938
...IGNORE THE YELLING,
THEY´RE JUST ROUGHHOUSING.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.918
Benny:
LET´S GET THIS OVER WITH.

14:07.918 --> 14:09.519
HERE´S THE NUMBER
TO OUR HOTEL IN PHOENIX.

14:09.519 --> 14:11.021
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA BE BACK?

14:11.021 --> 14:13.123
WELL, THE FUNERAL´S
SOMETIME TOMORROW,

14:13.123 --> 14:16.356
BUT WE HAVEN´T BEEN ABLE
TO TALK TO LYDIA TO FIND
OUT ALL THE DETAILS.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.488
THANKS FOR WATCHING
THE KIDS.

14:18.488 --> 14:20.330
OH, NO PROBLEM.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.292
I LOVE KIDS.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.140

OF YOUR LIFE.

14:30.140 --> 14:33.303
FEED THEM...
CLOTHE THEM...

14:33.303 --> 14:35.405
...AND THEN
THEY TURN ON YOU.

14:38.008 --> 14:40.110
OH, NO, MOM, YOU´LL KNOW
WHEN I TURN ON YOU.

14:40.110 --> 14:43.383

THE FULL WEIGHT OF MY KNEES

14:43.383 --> 14:45.555
ON YOUR SHOULDERS...

14:45.555 --> 14:48.558
AND THE PILLOW
WILL SLOWLY COME OVER YOU...

14:48.558 --> 14:50.890
AND YOU´LL SEE
A BRIGHT LIGHT...

14:50.890 --> 14:53.293
BUT THAT´S
ONLY ANGIE VIDEOTAPING

14:53.293 --> 14:55.295

14:55.295 --> 14:58.328
THIS IS FOR YOU, DAD.

14:58.328 --> 15:01.371

LONG ENOUGH TO..."

THE LETTER!

TO YOU, MY SON."

15:59.089 --> 16:01.261
YEAH, YOU´RE RIGHT,
MOM, HUH?

16:01.261 --> 16:02.993
HE DIDN´T CARE ABOUT ME.

I´M GLAD I NEVER GOT
TO KNOW HIM!

THIS LAST REQUEST."

16:51.681 --> 16:55.185

A KIDNEY...

AND HE DOESN´T WANT ME
TO TARNISH HIS FUNERAL.

16:59.349 --> 17:02.021
AND I´M SUPPOSED TO KEEP THIS
TO REMEMBER HIM BY?

17:02.021 --> 17:05.055
YOU SEE, THIS IS WHY
IT´S JUST STUFF.

17:13.703 --> 17:16.166
YOU MISSED THE BEST PART
OF THE LETTER, MOM.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.707
YEAH?

17:17.707 --> 17:21.241
YEAH, MY DEAD FATHER DOESN´T
WANT ME TO COME TO HIS FUNERAL.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.773
HIS FRIENDS DON´T KNOW
HE DITCHED US...

FOR HIS REPUTATION.

17:36.126 --> 17:37.527
YOU WERE RIGHT.

17:37.527 --> 17:41.161
YEAH, FOR ONCE
I WISH I WASN´T.

17:41.161 --> 17:45.795
HEY...AT LEAST YOU GOT
THAT JACKASS´S GOLD WATCH.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.202
THAT THING WAS WORTH A FORTUNE
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER.

17:52.202 --> 17:55.074
I CAN´T IMAGINE
WHAT IT´S WORTH NOW.

18:01.651 --> 18:04.384
I THINK IT´S GONE DOWN
IN VALUE.

18:09.519 --> 18:11.291
George: LISTEN,
I´VE BEEN THINKIN´.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.623
THE REASON I DON´T HAVE
ANY MEMENTOS IS BECAUSE

18:13.623 --> 18:17.567
I DIDN´T HAVE A LOT OF GOOD
THINGS TO REMEMBER GROWING UP.

18:17.567 --> 18:18.828
BUT YOU DID,

18:18.828 --> 18:20.630
SO I SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT.

18:20.630 --> 18:25.135
SO TO MAKE UP FOR THROWING OUT
YOUR GRANDMOTHER´S STUFF,

18:25.135 --> 18:26.676
I CALLED ALL YOUR RELATIVES

18:26.676 --> 18:30.510
AND TRIED TO TRACK DOWN
A PICTURE OR SOME CLOTHING --

18:30.510 --> 18:31.811
SOMETHING FROM HER.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.144

I WOULDN´T GO TO CUBA

SO SENILE,

19:28.468 --> 19:32.171
