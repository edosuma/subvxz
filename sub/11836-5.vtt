WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:02.503
BERLUTI:
Previously on The Practice...

00:02.536 --> 00:03.169
(glass shatters)

00:03.203 --> 00:04.237
STRINGER: (gasps)

00:06.507 --> 00:08.542
First of all,
what's going on?

00:08.575 --> 00:09.342
Are you leaving?

00:09.375 --> 00:10.677
I'm done.

00:10.711 --> 00:11.545
Retiring.

00:11.578 --> 00:13.013
You're retiring?

00:13.046 --> 00:14.681
I can't make the rent.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.083
I'm being evicted.

00:17.117 --> 00:19.219
(knocks on door)

00:19.252 --> 00:21.522
All set?
I wanna start my own practice.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.190
Start a new practice
in this room?

00:24.224 --> 00:25.826
DOLE: I can take
little collection cases,

00:25.859 --> 00:27.728
contract disputes,
fight parking tickets.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.463
I can even be
my own secretary.

00:30.496 --> 00:32.432
Don't you like it?

00:32.465 --> 00:34.234
Well, yes, uh,

00:34.267 --> 00:36.603
but usually
the personal stuff

00:36.637 --> 00:38.071
is left off the door.

00:38.104 --> 00:39.239
I'll take it off
eventually.

00:39.272 --> 00:40.507
But I want the people
who hire me

00:40.541 --> 00:41.608
to get the idea.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.143
<i>I'm not gonna be here late</i>
<i>or on call at home.</i>

00:43.176 --> 00:44.277
When they see "Mother",

00:44.310 --> 00:45.311
it makes a point.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.715
If I pick him up
after Dr. Ash,

00:48.749 --> 00:50.817
that'll give me time
to go straight--

00:50.851 --> 00:53.086
Bobby, look.

00:53.119 --> 00:54.555
I think it's a client.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.256
That could be
my first client.

00:56.289 --> 00:58.124
Why else would she be
sitting there?

00:58.158 --> 00:59.159
Do you think
she's a client?

00:59.192 --> 01:01.267
Why don't you ask her?

01:05.004 --> 01:06.106
Excuse me.

01:06.139 --> 01:07.040
You're here to see...

01:07.073 --> 01:07.908
Lindsay Dole,

01:07.941 --> 01:09.442
attorney-at-law, mother.

01:09.475 --> 01:10.711
That's me.

01:10.744 --> 01:12.178
How did you hear of me?

01:12.212 --> 01:13.246
Well, I came to see Pat Magee,

01:13.279 --> 01:14.347
but he's not here.

01:14.380 --> 01:16.517
And I saw the door
and I figured

01:16.550 --> 01:18.619
I could see whatever lawyer.

01:18.652 --> 01:22.122
But actually I think
I have heard of you.

01:22.155 --> 01:24.958
Aren't you the lady
who shot somebody?

01:24.991 --> 01:27.093
DOLE: I did, but I beat it.

01:27.127 --> 01:28.829
Technicality.

01:28.862 --> 01:29.863
Come on in.

01:29.896 --> 01:31.632
Okay.

01:31.665 --> 01:33.900
Uh, it wasn't a client
you shot, right?

01:33.934 --> 01:35.869
DOLE: No, no, no.

01:38.238 --> 01:39.740
YOUNG: It doesn't
concern you.

01:39.773 --> 01:40.874
It concerns the firm,

01:40.907 --> 01:42.543
which concerns me, Eugene.

01:42.576 --> 01:44.811
What's going on?

01:44.845 --> 01:45.679
Tell him.

01:45.712 --> 01:47.180
A client came in
last night.

01:47.213 --> 01:47.981
I took the case.

01:48.014 --> 01:49.149
Jimmy doesn't like it.

01:49.182 --> 01:51.718
BERLUTI: The client
does stem cell research.

01:51.752 --> 01:53.186
FRUTT: It's an abatement
proceeding.

01:53.219 --> 01:54.120
What's the big deal?

01:54.154 --> 01:55.255
The big deal is

01:55.288 --> 01:56.857
it's a political hot button

01:56.890 --> 01:58.258
that this firm
doesn't need,

01:58.291 --> 01:59.726
and I think it should have
been discussed.

01:59.760 --> 02:00.667
Oh, come on.

02:00.701 --> 02:01.768
Don't hide behind that.

02:01.802 --> 02:02.803
Why don't you just say it?

02:02.836 --> 02:04.004
You don't like the research.

02:04.037 --> 02:04.905
It isn't that.

02:04.938 --> 02:06.006
FRUTT: A political
hot button?

02:06.039 --> 02:08.140
When have we ever
shied away from a case?

02:08.174 --> 02:10.276
This office was bombed
before, Ellenor.

02:10.310 --> 02:11.945
Yes, by a client
that we defended

02:11.978 --> 02:12.813
on murder charges.

02:12.846 --> 02:13.880
Does that mean
we should shy away

02:13.914 --> 02:15.315
from all homicide cases?

02:15.348 --> 02:16.349
All right.

02:18.885 --> 02:19.853
Eugene?

02:21.622 --> 02:23.056
The city rezoned
to basically

02:23.089 --> 02:24.224
put the center
out of business.

02:24.257 --> 02:27.628
It's all politics and,
I guess, now religion.

02:27.661 --> 02:29.229
It isn't that.

02:29.262 --> 02:30.964
Look, we're all in agreement

02:30.997 --> 02:34.200
that we face some
public-relations obstacles.

02:34.234 --> 02:35.702
We're still getting
hate mail over Lindsay.

02:35.736 --> 02:37.137
Lindsay doesn't work
here anymore.

02:37.170 --> 02:39.439
But people
don't really know that.

02:39.472 --> 02:41.174
Come on. I'm not
being unreasonable.

02:41.207 --> 02:43.376
This could explode
in our faces.

02:43.409 --> 02:44.945
And I think
we should have discussed it.

02:44.978 --> 02:46.246
There wasn't time.

02:46.279 --> 02:47.781
And with all
due respect, Jimmy,

02:47.814 --> 02:49.182
last time
I checked the door,

02:49.215 --> 02:50.651
you weren't listed
as a partner.

02:50.684 --> 02:52.152
Fine.

02:53.486 --> 02:54.655
YOUNG: We're due in at 9:00.

02:54.688 --> 02:55.388
I'll let you know.

02:55.421 --> 02:56.657
Come on.

02:58.725 --> 02:59.626
BERLUTI: Three lawyers?

02:59.660 --> 03:01.067
YOUNG: Yes.
You wanna come?

03:01.101 --> 03:02.569
That'll make 3 1/2.

03:02.603 --> 03:03.269
BERLUTI: Hey, you know what--

03:03.303 --> 03:04.104
DONNELL: Jimmy--

03:04.137 --> 03:05.071
(door closes)

03:05.105 --> 03:06.573
--you provoked that.

03:06.607 --> 03:09.275
My only beef,

03:09.309 --> 03:12.145
I think the firm
should have discussed it first.

03:12.178 --> 03:15.716
This is gonna blow up
in our faces.

03:17.718 --> 03:20.654
(music playing)

04:06.673 --> 04:07.908
That's it?

04:07.941 --> 04:08.709
Just singing?

04:08.742 --> 04:10.143
SHIPP: Well, I sing loud.

04:10.176 --> 04:11.477
I have a big diaphragm.

04:11.512 --> 04:12.846
Jesus Christ, my Savior,

04:12.879 --> 04:15.248
gave me a booming voice
and a big heart,

04:15.281 --> 04:16.850
and I try to use both.

04:17.983 --> 04:20.019
Okay. And your neighbor,

04:20.053 --> 04:22.388
is there bad blood?

04:22.422 --> 04:23.456
No. He's a nice man.

04:23.489 --> 04:25.258
He just doesn't care
for my singing,

04:25.291 --> 04:26.560
which is his right.

04:26.593 --> 04:28.061
I know it's a free country,

04:28.094 --> 04:29.295
to each his own.

04:29.329 --> 04:31.732
But in the spirit
of that freedom,

04:31.765 --> 04:33.767
I should be able to sing, right?

04:33.800 --> 04:35.602
Well, if he's bringing
a nuisance action,

04:35.635 --> 04:37.403
he's basically saying
that you're interfering

04:37.436 --> 04:39.472
with the quiet enjoyment
of his home.

04:39.506 --> 04:41.775
Oh, that's hooey.

04:41.808 --> 04:42.943
He's a loud man himself.

04:42.976 --> 04:44.911
He doesn't enjoy
anything quiet.

04:44.945 --> 04:47.113
You should hear him
watching The Patriots.

04:47.147 --> 04:48.915
That's my goal, by the way,

04:48.949 --> 04:51.384
to one day
sing the national anthem

04:51.417 --> 04:52.919
at a Patriots game.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.622
Okay. Uh, well,

04:55.656 --> 04:57.624
there's a hearing
scheduled for 2:00.

04:57.658 --> 04:59.425
Let's see how we do.

04:59.459 --> 05:01.668
SHIPP: Okay.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.904
I have a very good feel
about you.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.672
I can tell
you're a warm person.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.007
Thank you.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.579
DAVIES: Look, whenever
a zoning ordinance is passed,

05:12.613 --> 05:15.616
somebody invariably
gets put out of business.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.684
That is not
an uncommon result.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.886
YOUNG: It is certainly
uncommon for the city

05:19.920 --> 05:21.021
to sprint off to Court

05:21.054 --> 05:22.455
to enforce that ordinance.

05:22.756 --> 05:23.824
And the impact
on my client

05:23.857 --> 05:25.025
is hardly incidental.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.126
That ordinance was passed

05:26.159 --> 05:28.128
for the express purpose
of closing the door--

05:28.161 --> 05:29.362
Were you in the room,
Mr. Young?

05:29.395 --> 05:30.864
I didn't have to be,
Mr. Davies.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.633
The doors are as transparent
as the motives.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.701
DAVIES: Uh, Mr. Young
is claiming the city

05:34.735 --> 05:36.603
lacks the authority
to rezone districts.

05:36.637 --> 05:37.738
YOUNG: I am not claiming that.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.340
I am saying this ordinance
was arbitrary.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.908
It was promulgated
in bad faith.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.043
It is politics.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.344
And contrary to what Mister--

05:44.377 --> 05:45.579
(printer whirs)

05:46.847 --> 05:48.715
Counsel?

05:48.749 --> 05:49.950
Uh, I apologize.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.055
YOUNG: Your honor,
I call your attention

05:55.088 --> 05:57.023
to Blankenship vs. Michalski,

05:57.057 --> 06:01.467
recently decided in 1957.

06:05.872 --> 06:07.240
The city of Palo Alto

06:07.273 --> 06:09.009
rezoned its permitted-use zones

06:09.042 --> 06:11.077
for the purpose of closing
down a pharmacy.

06:11.111 --> 06:12.679
The Court struck down
the ordinance

06:12.713 --> 06:14.581
as arbitrary and invalid.

06:14.615 --> 06:16.249
It's decidedly on point.

06:16.282 --> 06:18.819
DAVIES: I reiterate,
every time a city zones

06:18.852 --> 06:21.755
or rezones,
somebody claims foul.

06:21.788 --> 06:23.624
Don't insult me, Mr. Davies.

06:23.657 --> 06:26.226
A zoning board burns
the midnight oil

06:26.259 --> 06:27.260
to push this through.

06:27.293 --> 06:28.862
They then dispatch "Top Gun"

06:28.895 --> 06:30.697
to get injunctive relief.

06:30.731 --> 06:32.265
The victim here is a facility

06:32.298 --> 06:35.669
that just happens to do
stem cell research.

06:35.702 --> 06:37.337
Do you really mean to tell me

06:37.370 --> 06:38.539
they're not a target?

06:38.572 --> 06:40.707
DAVIES: Even if
the ordinance was designed

06:40.741 --> 06:42.442
to impact the facility,

06:42.475 --> 06:44.945
and I make no such concession,

06:44.978 --> 06:46.246
I maintain the action

06:46.279 --> 06:47.681
was neither arbitrary

06:47.714 --> 06:49.082
nor capricious.

06:49.115 --> 06:51.552
I want to see the chairman
of the zoning board

06:51.585 --> 06:52.886
in the witness chair.

06:52.919 --> 06:54.420
I beg your pardon?

06:54.454 --> 06:55.522
The motive of the board

06:55.556 --> 06:57.257
is very much in play here,
Mr. Davies.

06:57.290 --> 06:58.892
And from where I sit,
this ordinance smells

06:58.925 --> 07:01.301
like a dead, decaying rat.

07:01.334 --> 07:02.202
Get the chairman
in the hot seat

07:02.235 --> 07:04.838
or you won't like my ruling.

07:06.773 --> 07:08.274
FRUTT: 1957?

07:08.308 --> 07:09.375
STRINGER:
It was on point.

07:09.409 --> 07:10.744
FRUTT: Yes. Decidedly.

07:10.777 --> 07:12.312
We all heard.
YOUNG: Never mind.

07:12.345 --> 07:14.648
Look, the good news is,
obviously,

07:14.681 --> 07:15.816
the Judge seems with us.

07:15.849 --> 07:18.184
The bad news, by calling
an evidentiary hearing,

07:18.218 --> 07:21.121
this thing is headed
for a debate on the merits,

07:21.154 --> 07:23.156
which means
you could be testifying.

07:23.189 --> 07:24.024
Fine.

07:24.057 --> 07:25.291
YOUNG: Not so fine.

07:25.325 --> 07:27.894
Um, uh, no offense,

07:27.928 --> 07:29.095
but in my experience,

07:29.129 --> 07:30.697
scientists make
for lousy witnesses.

07:30.731 --> 07:32.198
I need somebody
to exude passion.

07:32.232 --> 07:33.499
I can do that.

07:33.534 --> 07:35.702
All the same,
I need somebody--

07:35.736 --> 07:39.172
Eugene, I have diabetes.

07:39.205 --> 07:40.974
Both my father
and my grandfather

07:41.007 --> 07:42.809
died of Alzheimer's.

07:42.843 --> 07:44.377
Don't worry about passion.

07:49.550 --> 07:51.117
The press is calling.

07:51.151 --> 07:52.052
Word's already out.

07:52.085 --> 07:53.820
Great.

07:53.854 --> 07:55.488
YOUNG: What? Suddenly
we're afraid of the media?

07:55.522 --> 07:57.223
FRUTT: Our Judge Fox
is a registered Republican.

07:57.257 --> 07:58.124
Did we know that?

07:58.158 --> 07:59.292
YOUNG: So?

07:59.325 --> 08:01.935
So given the
administration's policy

08:01.968 --> 08:03.336
against stem cell research,

08:03.369 --> 08:05.138
she might not favor us
as much as we thought.

08:05.171 --> 08:06.740
Actually, President Bush

08:06.773 --> 08:09.009
very quietly shifted
his policy on that.

08:09.042 --> 08:10.476
They issued a clarification

08:10.511 --> 08:12.546
which allows
for private funding.

08:12.579 --> 08:15.348
That's not exactly true.

08:15.381 --> 08:17.017
There's one other danger.

08:17.050 --> 08:19.052
This case hits
all of the abortion buttons.

08:19.085 --> 08:20.486
Gee.

08:20.521 --> 08:22.322
FRUTT: And since Roe V. Wade
is vulnerable,

08:22.355 --> 08:24.190
which Fox also knows,

08:24.224 --> 08:25.592
I'm concerned about Davies

08:25.626 --> 08:26.727
turning this
into a referendum.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.530
I'm sure they're the ones
who tipped off the press.

08:29.563 --> 08:30.931
DONNELL: Why is Roe
versus Wade vulnerable?

08:30.964 --> 08:33.466
Hello? Have you glanced
at the Supreme Court lately?

08:33.499 --> 08:35.400
Rehnquist, Scalia,

08:35.434 --> 08:36.636
Thomas, Kennedy,

08:36.669 --> 08:38.004
even Sandra Day O'Connor.

08:38.038 --> 08:39.506
This Court could overturn Roe

08:39.539 --> 08:40.506
in the blink of an eye.

08:40.541 --> 08:43.909
Um, actually,
that's not necessarily true.

08:43.943 --> 08:45.946
If you look at Planned
Parenthood versus Casey,

08:45.979 --> 08:47.648
decided in '92,
you'll see Kennedy,

08:47.681 --> 08:49.382
O'Connor, and Souter
all supported Roe.

08:49.415 --> 08:50.350
Wrong.

08:50.383 --> 08:51.351
We lose one justice,

08:51.384 --> 08:52.953
we lose Roe versus Wade.

08:52.986 --> 08:53.887
DONNELL:
Look, you don't wanna get

08:53.920 --> 08:55.121
into Roe versus Wade.

08:55.155 --> 08:56.857
This case is much simpler
than that.

08:56.890 --> 08:58.091
It deals with the authority

08:58.124 --> 08:59.526
of a zoning board, period.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.802
And that's where
your focus is.

09:01.835 --> 09:03.970
Killing embryos
is simple to you?

09:04.004 --> 09:06.106
Hey, Jimmy, do us a favor--
Don't come at me.

09:06.139 --> 09:06.873
I don't like the hostility.
BERLUTI: Am I hostile?

09:06.907 --> 09:08.074
Come on, guys.

09:08.108 --> 09:10.210
I can't comment on the merits
of a case now?

09:10.243 --> 09:11.377
All right, you guys.
YOUNG: No, you can comment

09:11.411 --> 09:12.178
as a lawyer.

09:12.212 --> 09:13.747
I'd even appreciate that.

09:13.780 --> 09:14.615
But I don't need you

09:14.648 --> 09:16.149
flapping your Catholic feathers.

09:16.182 --> 09:17.217
Eugene.
WASHINGTON: Hey, you guys.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.585
BERLUTI: Hey,
if I ever said to you,

09:18.619 --> 09:20.286
"Stop flapping
your black wings,"

09:20.320 --> 09:21.321
you'd jump out--
YOUNG: (indistinct)

09:21.354 --> 09:22.322
see me do that.
BERLUTI: Hey,

09:22.355 --> 09:23.857
let me tell you something,

09:23.890 --> 09:26.159
the fact that I don't like
stem cell research,

09:26.192 --> 09:28.795
it goes to humanity,
not religion.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.130
But since you bring it up,

09:30.163 --> 09:32.633
I don't apologize
for being Catholic.

09:32.666 --> 09:33.834
And I'm sick
and tired of you

09:33.867 --> 09:34.801
and everyone else

09:34.835 --> 09:36.537
declaring war on Catholicism

09:36.570 --> 09:38.071
just because--
YOUNG: I haven't declared war

09:38.104 --> 09:39.272
on anything.
BERLUTI: Yes, you have.

09:39.305 --> 09:41.575
Because of a few bad priests.

09:41.608 --> 09:43.143
Yes, you have,
and I'm sick of it.

09:43.176 --> 09:45.912
DONNELL: All right,
that's enough.

09:45.946 --> 09:48.148
Both of you.

09:48.181 --> 09:50.817
You focus on the case.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.819
You stay away from him.

09:59.159 --> 10:00.934
I didn't provoke that one.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.543
(phone rings)

10:09.576 --> 10:11.912
HATCHER: Donnell, Young,
Dole, and Frutt.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.779
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.047
You've got the wrong number.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.916
Everyone makes that mistake.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.884
Uh, I believe the number
you're looking for is

10:17.918 --> 10:21.955
557-run-a-rod-up-your-rectum.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.056
Bye.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.426
WASHINGTON: I don't mean
to criticize your work.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.261
(sighs) They were looking
for the lawyer

10:28.294 --> 10:30.463
defending the fetus
factory, Rebecca.

10:30.496 --> 10:32.766
I see. Well, as long
as you don't inflame them.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.001
These people are already
on fire, Rebecca.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.170
These people?

10:37.203 --> 10:38.038
Jimmy...

10:40.907 --> 10:42.275
You support
what this laboratory

10:42.308 --> 10:43.744
is doing, Rebecca?

10:43.777 --> 10:44.778
Really?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.847
WASHINGTON:
Look at our client base.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.116
How many engage
in activities we support?

10:50.150 --> 10:51.752
That doesn't fly.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.087
Here, we're enabling
the activity.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.601
EMERSON: I love music

11:00.634 --> 11:03.036
and I'm very fond of Maxine.

11:03.069 --> 11:04.204
She knows this.

11:04.237 --> 11:05.238
She's a good person,

11:05.271 --> 11:07.508
but I just can't take it.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.042
Take what, Mr. Emerson?

11:09.075 --> 11:11.444
The singing.

11:11.477 --> 11:14.447
Every morning, 8:15.

11:14.480 --> 11:15.849
And it's the same song,

11:15.882 --> 11:17.417
One Moment in Time.

11:17.450 --> 11:19.119
She bellows it.

11:19.152 --> 11:21.354
My walls practically shake.

11:21.387 --> 11:23.023
Is this really
such a problem?

11:23.056 --> 11:25.892
You know, I said the same
thing to myself, at first.

11:25.926 --> 11:27.027
It's just a few minutes.

11:27.060 --> 11:29.229
What's the big deal?

11:29.262 --> 11:31.732
And it's not like
she has a bad voice.

11:31.765 --> 11:33.834
But (sighs) well,

11:33.867 --> 11:35.669
when I bought this condo,

11:35.702 --> 11:37.638
it was mine, you know?

11:37.671 --> 11:40.073
And a person looks
to realize a few dreams

11:40.106 --> 11:41.374
when he becomes
a property owner.

11:41.407 --> 11:43.510
You know what I mean, Judge?

11:43.544 --> 11:44.611
I'm sure I do,

11:44.645 --> 11:47.247
but I never tire
of hearing it said aloud.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.584
EMERSON: Well, my dream
was a cup of coffee

11:50.617 --> 11:51.985
and the morning paper.

11:52.018 --> 11:54.254
A quiet cup of coffee

11:54.287 --> 11:56.156
in my very own dominion,

11:56.189 --> 11:58.592
as I sit and read
the sports section.

11:58.625 --> 12:00.734
I don't get this.

12:00.767 --> 12:03.504
I get One Moment in Time

12:03.537 --> 12:06.206
every single day.

12:06.239 --> 12:08.609
Did you ever ask her to stop?

12:08.642 --> 12:10.010
Yes.

12:10.043 --> 12:11.578
She said she just had
to sing it,

12:11.612 --> 12:13.213
and it had to be
in the morning,

12:13.246 --> 12:14.815
and it had to be loud.

12:14.848 --> 12:15.949
It was her way to get ready

12:15.982 --> 12:17.383
to face her day.

12:18.785 --> 12:20.453
And I just couldn't
take it anymore.

12:21.622 --> 12:24.057
So we took steps to stop it.

12:24.090 --> 12:25.325
DAVIES: So you don't deny

12:25.358 --> 12:27.460
you rezoned this district

12:27.493 --> 12:29.329
to purposely put
the Wayne Cell

12:29.362 --> 12:31.598
Technology Institute
out of business?

12:31.632 --> 12:34.234
We feel it poses a danger
to the community.

12:34.267 --> 12:36.236
It represents a magnet
for protest,

12:36.269 --> 12:38.371
possibly violent protest,

12:38.404 --> 12:40.874
even religious terrorism.

12:40.907 --> 12:42.142
DAVIES: Because their research

12:42.175 --> 12:44.545
involves stem cell research?

12:44.578 --> 12:45.812
Yes.

12:45.846 --> 12:47.413
Abortion clinics
have been attacked

12:47.447 --> 12:49.049
and similarly rezoned

12:49.082 --> 12:51.017
because of safety concerns.

12:51.051 --> 12:53.286
We did the same thing.

12:53.319 --> 12:55.255
So this is all about safety?

12:55.288 --> 12:55.922
Yes.

12:55.956 --> 12:56.957
Protecting lives?

12:56.990 --> 12:57.824
BLAIN: Yes.

12:57.858 --> 13:00.026
Protecting human life?

13:00.060 --> 13:01.234
I know where you're going,

13:01.267 --> 13:03.303
and that wasn't it.

13:03.336 --> 13:05.772
You're a member of the
Republican party, Mr. Blain?

13:05.806 --> 13:08.609
Objection. This doesn't
concern politics.

13:08.642 --> 13:10.711
Oh, it doesn't?
The issue before this Court

13:10.744 --> 13:11.912
is whether the zoning board

13:11.945 --> 13:13.847
acted capriciously.

13:13.880 --> 13:14.848
FOX: I agree.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.282
The objection is sustained.

13:16.316 --> 13:18.318
You say, sir,

13:18.351 --> 13:20.353
the Wayne Cell
Technology Institute

13:20.386 --> 13:22.689
might be a magnet
for violent protest

13:22.723 --> 13:24.925
because of the type
of research it does.

13:24.958 --> 13:26.192
Correct.

13:26.226 --> 13:27.327
Has it ever been targeted,

13:27.360 --> 13:28.294
to your knowledge?

13:28.328 --> 13:30.797
No. Are we supposed to wait
till it happens?

13:30.831 --> 13:32.666
YOUNG: Ever received
any threats?

13:32.699 --> 13:33.700
I don't know where you've lived

13:33.734 --> 13:34.935
the last year, Mr. Young,

13:34.968 --> 13:36.436
but things can blow up

13:36.469 --> 13:38.304
absent a threat these days.

13:38.338 --> 13:40.173
YOUNG: So we should just
start zoning out

13:40.206 --> 13:42.075
any possible
target of violence,

13:42.108 --> 13:43.309
is that your position, sir?

13:43.343 --> 13:45.278
Our position
is we should zone out

13:45.311 --> 13:47.113
this particular facility.

13:47.147 --> 13:49.349
And it is located
in the same district

13:49.382 --> 13:51.451
as Mass General Hospital,
is it not?

13:51.484 --> 13:52.519
Yes.

13:52.553 --> 13:53.787
Is it your feeling, sir,

13:53.820 --> 13:55.822
that if Mass General
began a program

13:55.856 --> 13:57.357
on stem cell research,

13:57.390 --> 13:59.993
that you'd zone it out
of business?

14:00.026 --> 14:01.968
No, that is not my feeling.

14:02.002 --> 14:03.837
Well, why not?

14:03.870 --> 14:05.839
Mass General
is a world-renowned hospital.

14:05.872 --> 14:07.874
It could become
a high-profile magnet

14:07.908 --> 14:09.309
for protest.

14:09.342 --> 14:11.512
I believe that people
would weigh

14:11.545 --> 14:13.914
all the public good
Mass General does

14:13.947 --> 14:15.982
against the controversy
of the research

14:16.016 --> 14:19.352
and find it to be
a redeeming facility.

14:19.385 --> 14:20.486
YOUNG: Ah,
and you don't think

14:20.521 --> 14:22.088
my client's institute

14:22.122 --> 14:24.290
serves the public good?

14:25.926 --> 14:27.661
No, we don't.

14:27.694 --> 14:29.630
Thank you, Mr. Blain.

14:31.031 --> 14:32.599
(sighs)

14:33.700 --> 14:35.536
You want me to testify?

14:35.569 --> 14:36.469
DOLE:
Well, here's the thing,

14:36.503 --> 14:37.771
right now
it doesn't seem like

14:37.804 --> 14:39.472
a hardship for you
not to be able

14:39.506 --> 14:40.206
to sing this song.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.041
Yes, it is.

14:41.074 --> 14:42.075
Let me finish.

14:42.108 --> 14:44.410
Which means, for us to win,

14:44.444 --> 14:46.212
we need you
to impress the Judge

14:46.246 --> 14:48.549
with why it's so
important to you.

14:48.582 --> 14:50.851
It's how I start my day.

14:50.884 --> 14:52.753
Yes, we have to make
a strong case

14:52.786 --> 14:55.556
as to why you need it
to start your day.

14:55.589 --> 14:57.724
I can't make
that showing, Maxine.

14:57.758 --> 14:59.292
It's why I hired you.

14:59.325 --> 15:00.801
DOLE: No lawyer
is going to be able

15:00.834 --> 15:02.503
to convince a Judge
that a person

15:02.536 --> 15:03.537
needs to kick off
her morning

15:03.570 --> 15:04.638
with One Fine Day.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.740
One Moment in Time.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.842
I need you to speak
from your heart.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.711
Can you do that?

15:10.744 --> 15:12.412
Jesus gave me a big heart.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.114
Yes, and I want you
to use it,

15:14.147 --> 15:15.882
just like you do
your diaphragm.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.183
Tell that Judge.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.553
Make us all feel it.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.887
Can you do that, Maxine?

15:22.255 --> 15:24.725
Yes, I can.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.426
I will.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.529
Good.

15:32.633 --> 15:35.702
(knocks on door)

15:35.736 --> 15:37.638
You still here?

15:42.075 --> 15:43.544
Something's on your mind.

15:45.812 --> 15:48.448
(sighs) Yeah.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.683
I don't know whether

15:49.716 --> 15:52.553
I'm your best friend
anymore, Eugene,

15:52.586 --> 15:54.521
but you're still
pretty much mine.

15:54.555 --> 15:56.222
And I'm pretty much honored.

15:58.759 --> 16:00.801
I'm Catholic, Eugene,

16:00.834 --> 16:02.803
and your
anti-Catholic remarks--

16:02.836 --> 16:03.604
YOUNG: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:03.637 --> 16:06.106
I'm not
anti-Catholic, Bobby.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.541
I am angry
at the Catholic Church.

16:07.574 --> 16:09.209
I think the Church
should go the way of Enron,

16:09.242 --> 16:10.511
but I assure you

16:10.544 --> 16:13.346
I am not anti-Catholic.

16:13.379 --> 16:16.249
Look, I'm a Christian man.

16:16.282 --> 16:17.183
To tell you the truth,

16:17.217 --> 16:18.051
I don't know the difference

16:18.084 --> 16:19.886
between my Protestant
denomination

16:19.920 --> 16:21.822
and Catholicism

16:21.855 --> 16:23.189
other than our hymns

16:23.223 --> 16:24.357
have a little more pep.

16:24.390 --> 16:26.527
Are you a Christian?

16:26.560 --> 16:27.393
Really?

16:29.796 --> 16:31.164
Now, I feel a judgment,

16:31.197 --> 16:33.166
and I don't like it.

16:33.199 --> 16:36.637
DONNELL: Eugene, I'm not
a hugely religious guy,

16:38.004 --> 16:40.040
but I do believe in God.

16:41.107 --> 16:42.809
I believe man has a soul.

16:42.843 --> 16:44.077
You think I don't?

16:44.110 --> 16:46.012
Maybe in theory.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.682
But what you live by,

16:48.715 --> 16:50.684
you believe in the law.

16:50.717 --> 16:52.152
And you know what,
it happens to most

16:52.185 --> 16:53.219
criminal defense attorneys.

16:53.253 --> 16:54.220
What happens?

16:54.254 --> 16:55.388
DONNELL: We free killers

16:55.421 --> 16:57.357
for a living, rapists,

16:57.390 --> 16:59.159
people who sometimes
go on to rape

16:59.192 --> 17:00.834
and kill others.

17:00.867 --> 17:03.336
And the only way
we live with ourselves

17:03.369 --> 17:05.471
is to treat the law

17:05.506 --> 17:06.873
like a religion.

17:06.906 --> 17:09.242
That's what you do.

17:09.275 --> 17:11.011
And over time...

17:13.880 --> 17:16.249
it's making you angry.

17:19.385 --> 17:21.555
I think you got this void.

17:21.588 --> 17:23.589
Really?

17:23.624 --> 17:24.858
You're wrong.

17:24.891 --> 17:27.359
And I have a case
I need to work on.

17:28.294 --> 17:30.330
Okay. Look, I'm not
in here to say,

17:30.363 --> 17:32.232
"Go get born again,"

17:32.265 --> 17:35.168
but out of respect for me

17:35.201 --> 17:38.138
and Jimmy,

17:38.171 --> 17:41.041
lay off the
anti-Catholic rhetoric.

17:58.992 --> 18:00.060
SHIPP: First,
my doctor tells me

18:00.093 --> 18:01.267
I got low self-esteem

18:01.301 --> 18:02.869
on account of being obese.

18:02.903 --> 18:05.271
Then he says
I'm depressed.

18:05.305 --> 18:08.374
He prescribed Prozac,
then Zoloft,

18:08.408 --> 18:11.111
then some
bullet-sized fat pills

18:11.144 --> 18:12.879
I can't even pronounce.

18:12.913 --> 18:14.548
None of it worked.

18:14.581 --> 18:17.117
I got up every day
and I felt the same.

18:17.150 --> 18:18.084
Which was?

18:18.118 --> 18:19.853
Like a doughnut.

18:19.886 --> 18:22.288
This big wad of soft dough

18:22.322 --> 18:24.791
with a giant hole
in the middle.

18:24.825 --> 18:27.894
I could barely get out of bed.

18:27.928 --> 18:30.030
And I'd drag my overweight,

18:30.063 --> 18:33.033
overmedicated
fat self to work.

18:33.066 --> 18:35.135
And I'd stink at my job,

18:35.168 --> 18:37.103
which made me more depressed,

18:37.137 --> 18:38.772
which made me eat more,

18:38.805 --> 18:39.973
which made me more fat,

18:40.006 --> 18:42.709
which made me stink more.

18:42.743 --> 18:47.047
Until I found the song.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.114
The song?

18:48.148 --> 18:50.951
One Moment in Time.

18:50.984 --> 18:52.118
Whitney Houston.

18:52.152 --> 18:53.820
The woman has heart.

18:53.854 --> 18:56.156
And hers would speak to mine

18:56.189 --> 18:57.991
through that song.

18:58.024 --> 19:00.967
And I so love to sing.

19:01.001 --> 19:01.968
I tried it.

19:02.002 --> 19:03.837
And you know what,

19:03.870 --> 19:06.239
it worked.

19:06.272 --> 19:07.273
The melody,

19:07.307 --> 19:09.475
the lyrics, whatever.

19:09.510 --> 19:12.412
I'd just puff myself up

19:12.445 --> 19:14.581
with inspiration and hope,

19:14.615 --> 19:18.785
and I'd charge off to work.

19:18.819 --> 19:21.287
And you know what else?

19:21.321 --> 19:23.857
I got good at what I do.

19:23.890 --> 19:26.627
I no longer stink.

19:26.660 --> 19:30.030
I'm no longer depressed.

19:30.063 --> 19:31.598
I'm still fat.

19:31.632 --> 19:34.134
Maxine, do you have
to sing it

19:34.167 --> 19:34.901
in the morning?

19:34.935 --> 19:35.769
Yes.

19:35.802 --> 19:37.671
Before I start my day.

19:37.704 --> 19:39.372
Uh, I'm not trying to upset
Mr. Emerson.

19:39.405 --> 19:40.841
He knows I like him.

19:40.874 --> 19:44.010
And I promise you
I need to do it.

19:44.044 --> 19:45.512
I swear.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.649
Thank you, Maxine.

19:54.287 --> 19:56.623
Could you sing it
for us now?

19:56.657 --> 19:57.390
What?

19:57.423 --> 19:58.892
Uh, the word "booming"

19:58.925 --> 20:00.200
has been used to describe it,

20:00.233 --> 20:01.868
but Mr. Emerson tells me

20:01.902 --> 20:03.870
one cannot fully appreciate

20:03.904 --> 20:06.840
the quaking nature
of your performance

20:06.873 --> 20:09.209
unless one actually
experiences it.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.176
Your honor, I object.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.778
Why?

20:11.812 --> 20:12.646
We're all sitting here

20:12.679 --> 20:14.180
wondering what the big deal is.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.115
Why don't we just listen

20:15.148 --> 20:16.049
for ourselves?

20:16.082 --> 20:17.183
EMERSON: And try to drink
a cup of coffee.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.351
I dare you.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.086
Thank you, Mr. Emerson.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.321
SHIPP: I need my boombox.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.388
I don't sing a cappella.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.456
Okay.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.691
You can get your accompaniment

20:24.725 --> 20:25.491
and come back.

20:25.526 --> 20:26.593
But, Ms. Shipp,

20:26.627 --> 20:29.195
you will be under oath
as you sing,

20:29.229 --> 20:30.964
which means, to be truthful,

20:30.997 --> 20:33.199
you must sing at the same volume

20:33.233 --> 20:34.568
you do every morning.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.002
Oh, don't worry, Your Honor.

20:36.036 --> 20:38.338
I only know one way to sing it.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.339
KITTLESON: Very well.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.341
We'll adjourn until 11:00,

20:41.374 --> 20:42.543
at which point we'll hear

20:42.576 --> 20:44.410
your rendition of...

20:44.444 --> 20:46.780
One Moment in Time.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.885
EDMUNDS: We do not
consider ourselves

20:51.918 --> 20:53.119
a security risk.

20:53.153 --> 20:54.320
Why not?

20:54.354 --> 20:56.189
EDMUNDS: We do not maintain
a high profile.

20:56.222 --> 20:57.323
If you drove by
our building,

20:57.357 --> 20:58.825
you may not even know
it's a biomedical

20:58.859 --> 20:59.726
research facility.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.068
And to date,
we have never faced

21:02.102 --> 21:03.537
so much as a picket line.

21:03.570 --> 21:06.006
So the idea
that we're a magnet for protest

21:06.039 --> 21:07.440
is totally unfounded.

21:07.473 --> 21:08.809
YOUNG: Okay.

21:09.075 --> 21:10.376
Doctor, you heard Mr. Blain

21:10.410 --> 21:11.978
talking about serving
the public good.

21:12.012 --> 21:14.414
I was offended
by that testimony.

21:14.447 --> 21:15.281
Why?

21:15.315 --> 21:18.719
Our research is designed
to save lives.

21:18.752 --> 21:20.486
There is no other motive.

21:20.521 --> 21:22.255
We're not like
a pharmaceutical company

21:22.288 --> 21:24.658
who develops a lifesaving drug,
which just so happens

21:24.691 --> 21:26.593
to bring in a billion dollars
in revenue.

21:26.627 --> 21:28.562
None of us
are getting rich here.

21:28.595 --> 21:30.030
None of us dream or hope to.

21:30.063 --> 21:32.833
Our goal, the only goal,

21:32.866 --> 21:36.202
is to protect human life
against disease.

21:36.236 --> 21:38.071
Along with treatments
for Alzheimer's,

21:38.104 --> 21:40.140
Parkinson's, heart disease.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.509
We're talking about treating
leading causes of death

21:42.543 --> 21:44.811
in this country
and around the world.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.947
But, doctor,
you know the concern.

21:46.980 --> 21:49.516
Today stem cell,
tomorrow cloning.

21:49.550 --> 21:51.685
We do not clone.

21:51.718 --> 21:53.086
We never will.

21:53.119 --> 21:55.756
And I take additional offense
at the implication

21:55.789 --> 21:57.223
that we're a bunch
of mad scientists

21:57.257 --> 22:00.026
running around
with petri dishes.

22:00.060 --> 22:02.603
You certainly seem
indignant, doctor.

22:02.636 --> 22:04.938
When religion raises
its ugly head

22:04.971 --> 22:06.673
to squash medical progress,

22:06.707 --> 22:07.941
I get indignant.

22:07.974 --> 22:10.711
You consider religion
to have an ugly head?

22:10.744 --> 22:12.613
EDMUNDS: I'm a man of faith,

22:12.646 --> 22:14.881
and I do believe in religion.

22:14.915 --> 22:17.317
But, yes, I'm coming
to the opinion that the head

22:17.350 --> 22:18.719
is often the ugly part.

22:18.752 --> 22:21.054
Your lawyer thinks
this is all politics.

22:21.087 --> 22:22.723
You think it's religion.

22:22.756 --> 22:24.758
Do you allow any room
for the possibility

22:24.791 --> 22:27.694
that your facility might be
a target of violence, any?

22:27.728 --> 22:30.096
I consider
such possibility negligible.

22:30.130 --> 22:31.932
It certainly doesn't warrant
shutting our doors.

22:31.965 --> 22:35.201
Because you're in the business
of saving human life.

22:35.235 --> 22:36.970
Tell me, doctor,

22:37.003 --> 22:39.573
when do you believe
human life begins?

22:39.606 --> 22:40.574
According to the law?

22:40.607 --> 22:41.642
DAVIES: No.
Uh, I'm not talking

22:41.675 --> 22:43.276
about the legal definition.

22:43.309 --> 22:45.045
I'm asking you as a person
of medical science,

22:45.078 --> 22:46.580
when does human life begin?

22:46.613 --> 22:49.115
When an organism matures
into a being depends...

22:49.149 --> 22:50.216
DAVIES: No. I'm not talking

22:50.250 --> 22:52.252
about the beginning
of a human being, doctor,

22:52.285 --> 22:54.655
and you know what I'm asking you
is not a complex question,

22:54.688 --> 22:56.690
so I'll ask it one more time.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.725
From a medical-science
perspective,

22:58.759 --> 23:01.367
when does human life begin?

23:01.401 --> 23:04.370
In its organism form,
upon conception.

23:04.404 --> 23:08.141
When an egg is fertilized
and an embryo forms, correct?

23:08.174 --> 23:09.710
EDMUNDS: Yes.
And your facility

23:09.743 --> 23:12.145
uses embryos
in its research,

23:12.178 --> 23:13.179
correct, doctor?

23:13.213 --> 23:15.148
Yes.
DAVIES: Human embryos.

23:15.181 --> 23:16.583
Yes.

23:16.617 --> 23:18.985
Doctor, where do
these embryos come from?

23:22.388 --> 23:24.591
Where do these embryos
come from?

23:24.625 --> 23:27.027
Many are discarded
from fertility clinics.

23:27.060 --> 23:28.729
Many?

23:28.762 --> 23:29.696
All?

23:29.730 --> 23:30.631
No.

23:30.664 --> 23:32.866
Where do the others
come from?

23:32.899 --> 23:35.068
We harvest them.

23:35.101 --> 23:37.170
DAVIES: You harvest them?

23:37.203 --> 23:39.472
You take an egg,
fertilize it,

23:39.506 --> 23:41.207
create an embryo,

23:41.241 --> 23:44.110
and then destroy it
for your research,

23:44.144 --> 23:45.411
right, doctor?

23:45.445 --> 23:47.447
Yes.
DAVIES: You create human life

23:47.480 --> 23:48.982
in order to destroy it.

23:49.015 --> 23:52.452
We create the embryos
to treat diseases

23:52.485 --> 23:53.954
which are destroying human life.

23:53.987 --> 23:55.421
DAVIES: Yes.
That's your take on it.

23:55.455 --> 23:56.489
Certainly you're aware, doctor,

23:56.523 --> 23:58.792
when it comes
to stem cell research,

23:58.825 --> 24:00.200
this is the public's
worst nightmare,

24:00.233 --> 24:01.401
that the scientists
will one day

24:01.434 --> 24:04.237
go from taking discarded embryos
from fertility clinics

24:04.270 --> 24:06.172
to harvesting
embryos themselves.

24:06.206 --> 24:07.641
That's the stated fear
on every talk show,

24:07.674 --> 24:08.441
isn't it, doctor?

24:08.474 --> 24:10.376
That day has already arrived,

24:10.410 --> 24:11.678
not only at our facility...
DAVIES: Okay.

24:11.712 --> 24:14.147
I really need you to answer
the questions I ask.

24:14.180 --> 24:15.315
You're doing in your lab

24:15.348 --> 24:18.184
the very thing
the public fears most.

24:18.218 --> 24:22.288
I don't know
what the public fears most.

24:22.322 --> 24:25.859
I would think
they'd fear sickness and death.

24:25.892 --> 24:28.494
You go to great lengths
to keep your research quiet

24:28.529 --> 24:30.964
so the public doesn't find out
you're harvesting embryos,

24:30.997 --> 24:32.165
don't you, doctor?

24:32.198 --> 24:34.100
We keep all
our research quiet.

24:34.134 --> 24:36.970
So your testimony,
should the public find out

24:37.003 --> 24:38.404
what you're doing,

24:38.438 --> 24:40.340
you couldn't possibly
become a target

24:40.373 --> 24:41.642
for violent protest?

24:41.675 --> 24:43.844
Why don't we see?

24:43.877 --> 24:45.512
Give the public
the benefit of the doubt

24:45.546 --> 24:47.548
before you shut us down.

24:47.581 --> 24:50.050
You've been keeping
this secret

24:50.083 --> 24:52.152
because you believe
in giving the public

24:52.185 --> 24:54.420
the benefit of the doubt.

24:59.159 --> 25:00.934
(door opens)

25:04.871 --> 25:06.072
(door closes)

25:06.106 --> 25:08.208
Why didn't you tell us
you were harvesting embryos?

25:08.241 --> 25:09.876
I wasn't really
at liberty to.

25:09.910 --> 25:12.178
We all signed
confidentiality agreements.

25:12.212 --> 25:13.013
YOUNG: Don't feed me that.

25:13.046 --> 25:15.181
Look, what we're doing
is not illegal.

25:15.215 --> 25:16.950
It's going on elsewhere,
like I said.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.819
And in the near future,
it will be going on

25:18.852 --> 25:20.353
at Mass General
and every major research...

25:20.386 --> 25:21.321
YOUNG: That's not the point.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.789
You were playing "hide the ball"

25:22.823 --> 25:23.857
with the wrong Judge.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.458
Somebody inside
must have whistled.

25:25.491 --> 25:26.927
I don't know how it got out.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.730
FRUTT: Well, like you said,
it's out now.

25:29.763 --> 25:31.164
May I make a suggestion?

25:33.199 --> 25:35.536
If this is why
they're rezoning you,

25:35.569 --> 25:37.337
maybe a deal can be struck.

25:37.370 --> 25:38.939
If you agree
to stop harvesting

25:38.972 --> 25:40.440
and only use
discarded embryos,

25:40.473 --> 25:42.242
maybe they'll drop
the ordinance.

25:42.275 --> 25:43.677
We can't.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.546
We don't get enough embryos
from the clinics.

25:45.579 --> 25:46.947
We need to harvest.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.615
Is it worth risking
being shut down?

25:48.649 --> 25:51.918
If we can't harvest,
they might as well shut us down.

25:51.952 --> 25:53.554
We need to win this, Eugene.

25:53.587 --> 25:56.156
Yeah. Well, you just made
that a lot tougher.

It's still a state
imposing its morality

28:08.942 --> 28:10.243
on a private facility.

28:10.276 --> 28:12.879
It's wrong,
and we should win.

28:12.913 --> 28:15.682
Fox is conservative,
but she's a fair Judge.

28:15.716 --> 28:16.683
Let's hope.

28:19.853 --> 28:20.721
DONNELL:
How's it going?

28:20.754 --> 28:22.122
YOUNG: Fine.
You need anything?

28:24.625 --> 28:26.459
I heard what happened
in Court.

28:26.492 --> 28:27.393
They're harvesting?

28:27.427 --> 28:28.261
Yup.

28:28.294 --> 28:29.663
What's next?

28:31.164 --> 28:32.566
I'll get up
and argue the law,

28:32.599 --> 28:34.100
like it's a religion,
is who I am.

28:34.134 --> 28:35.201
DONNELL: All right, Eugene.

28:35.235 --> 28:36.469
YOUNG: Look, I need
to prepare, so...

28:36.503 --> 28:37.971
DONNELL: I don't give a damn.
I came to you

28:38.004 --> 28:39.072
in the spirit of friendship.

28:39.105 --> 28:40.373
YOUNG: Telling me
I had no center?

28:40.406 --> 28:41.374
I never said that.

28:41.407 --> 28:42.042
YOUNG: I got the point, Bobby.

28:42.075 --> 28:43.710
I'm a man without a soul.

28:43.744 --> 28:45.145
You know what, Eugene,
you want to make me the enemy,

28:45.178 --> 28:46.146
fine.
YOUNG: No, no, no, no.

28:46.179 --> 28:47.347
The enemy is thyself.

28:47.380 --> 28:48.414
Isn't that
what the Bible says?

28:48.448 --> 28:50.283
DONNELL:
I take it all back.

28:50.316 --> 28:51.852
I was wrong.
I thought you were angry.

28:51.885 --> 28:52.753
Clearly, you're not.

28:52.786 --> 28:54.655
I thought the law
was your ideology,

28:54.688 --> 28:57.858
but I can see now,
you're a spiritual guy.

28:57.891 --> 29:00.100
Forgive me for trying
to step between you

29:00.133 --> 29:03.169
and your profound sense
of contentment.

29:09.676 --> 29:10.944
Did I miss something?

29:18.451 --> 29:20.954
PEETE: It was
a splendid performance.

29:20.987 --> 29:24.024
To hear it once,
fabulous.

29:24.057 --> 29:28.261
But day after day
after day after day--

29:28.294 --> 29:30.531
as Mr. Emerson stated,

29:30.564 --> 29:32.165
part of owning a home,

29:32.198 --> 29:34.200
perhaps the very essence of it,

29:34.234 --> 29:38.138
is your quiet enjoyment of it.

29:38.171 --> 29:40.707
To be able to sip
a cup of coffee

29:40.741 --> 29:42.042
in peace.

29:42.075 --> 29:43.944
Not all the time, of course.

29:43.977 --> 29:46.446
Uh, disturbances
are part of life.

29:46.479 --> 29:49.716
But Mr. Emerson shouldn't be
forced to endure

29:49.750 --> 29:53.687
a daily dose of what we heard
in this Courtroom.

29:53.720 --> 29:58.058
People do have a right
to peace and quiet.

30:08.474 --> 30:11.477
Peace and quiet
are overrated.

30:12.879 --> 30:16.717
I've just left my firm
to start my own practice,

30:16.750 --> 30:19.653
ostensibly,
to find peace and quiet.

30:19.686 --> 30:22.989
But I've discovered what
I've really been yearning for

30:23.023 --> 30:26.760
is a sense of being connected
with people,

30:26.793 --> 30:29.930
friends, loved ones.

30:29.963 --> 30:32.633
I've gotten to know
Maxine Shipp a little.

30:32.666 --> 30:33.734
I like her.

30:33.767 --> 30:35.602
And...

30:37.337 --> 30:40.340
I just think there's too much
peace and quiet going on.

30:40.373 --> 30:43.476
People building fences, gates,
getting bigger yards,

30:43.510 --> 30:45.612
going around
with Walkmans and iPods,

30:45.646 --> 30:47.981
wearing headphones,
shutting out the world

30:48.014 --> 30:49.516
in search of privacy,

30:49.550 --> 30:51.484
seclusion, peace and quiet,

30:51.518 --> 30:53.386
growing more isolated,

30:53.419 --> 30:55.388
if not lonely.

30:58.925 --> 31:01.802
We're all so disconnected,
you know?

31:03.436 --> 31:05.338
I think--

31:05.371 --> 31:07.574
I think we need to start
letting our neighbor's voices

31:07.608 --> 31:09.776
come through our walls more.

31:23.023 --> 31:26.893
The reason they kept
this research secret

31:26.927 --> 31:29.229
is because they knew
the incendiary reaction

31:29.262 --> 31:30.731
it would cause.

31:30.764 --> 31:34.267
The most volatile issue
in this country is abortion.

31:34.300 --> 31:36.202
It has been for 25 years.

31:36.236 --> 31:40.040
And stem cell research
triggers the same emotions

31:40.073 --> 31:41.742
compounded by the fears

31:41.775 --> 31:44.511
and condemnation
of runaway medical science.

31:44.545 --> 31:48.314
Where high-tech tissue plants
start to harvest cells,

31:48.348 --> 31:50.116
organs, and body parts,

31:50.150 --> 31:52.953
there is every reason
to fear protest,

31:52.986 --> 31:54.254
violence.

31:54.287 --> 31:56.489
And, accordingly,
there is nothing arbitrary

31:56.523 --> 31:59.225
about the decision
to rezone this district

31:59.259 --> 32:01.602
in the interest
of public safety.

32:01.635 --> 32:05.438
That's the legal argument,
Your Honor.

32:05.471 --> 32:07.273
But if I may,

32:07.307 --> 32:11.044
Mr. Blain also raised
the issue of public good.

32:11.077 --> 32:13.780
And the notion that that
is something the zoning board

32:13.814 --> 32:17.183
should be concerned
with was basically scoffed at

32:17.217 --> 32:19.219
by Mr. Young.

32:19.252 --> 32:21.822
Well, I don't scoff at it.

32:21.855 --> 32:25.391
Our public officials
are trustees.

32:25.425 --> 32:28.194
The public welfare
must always be a vital

32:28.228 --> 32:29.730
and relevant concern.

32:29.763 --> 32:31.965
By passing this ordinance,

32:31.998 --> 32:35.902
the zoning board is reaffirming
a sanctity to human life.

32:35.936 --> 32:38.805
Human life begins
at the embryo stage.

32:38.839 --> 32:40.974
Regardless
of one's position on abortion

32:41.007 --> 32:42.576
or when an unborn
should have rights,

32:42.609 --> 32:43.877
when it becomes a person,

32:43.910 --> 32:46.880
there is no medical or political
dispute that human life,

32:46.913 --> 32:50.584
in its organism stage,
begins upon conception.

32:50.617 --> 32:52.519
And I submit it is one thing,

32:52.553 --> 32:55.255
to balance the sanctity
of that life

32:55.288 --> 32:57.423
against the interests
of the mother and pro-choice.

32:57.457 --> 33:00.026
It is quite another
for an entity,

33:00.060 --> 33:01.167
public or private,

33:01.201 --> 33:03.469
to create human life

33:03.504 --> 33:06.840
for the purpose
of destroying it.

33:06.873 --> 33:09.543
To say that's acceptable

33:11.044 --> 33:13.747
is to assert
that human life itself

33:13.780 --> 33:16.149
has no intrinsic value.

33:16.182 --> 33:18.284
That it's not sacred.

33:18.318 --> 33:21.287
And once society accepts
that premise,

33:23.657 --> 33:26.026
God help us.

33:26.059 --> 33:29.262
Now, I'm sure Mr. Young
was hoping I'd say the word God,

33:29.295 --> 33:30.496
because he, no doubt,

33:30.531 --> 33:33.333
wants to lay this argument off
on religious dogma,

33:33.366 --> 33:35.235
because in a Court of law,
the words God,

33:35.268 --> 33:37.571
religion,
they're ugly words,

33:37.604 --> 33:39.472
aren't they?

33:39.506 --> 33:40.641
But the reality is,

33:40.674 --> 33:44.110
if one truly wants
to find dogma in this society,

33:44.144 --> 33:46.680
it's in the idea
that religion and God

33:46.713 --> 33:49.049
have no place
in our secular lives.

33:49.082 --> 33:51.317
We are much more dogmatic
in our commitment

33:51.351 --> 33:53.319
to the separation
of Church and State

33:53.353 --> 33:54.921
than we are towards
any faith.

33:54.955 --> 33:56.523
Mr. Davies,
you're getting off-track.

33:56.557 --> 33:58.358
I don't believe I am,
Your Honor.

33:58.391 --> 34:01.802
We are a nation, a people,

34:01.835 --> 34:04.971
a government
that profoundly believes

34:05.005 --> 34:07.240
in the sanctity
of human life.

34:07.273 --> 34:10.409
Defense should neither negate
nor invalidate that belief

34:10.443 --> 34:13.146
simply because
it might be rooted in faith

34:13.179 --> 34:15.516
or a commitment to God.

34:15.549 --> 34:18.685
What they're doing
in these test tubes

34:18.719 --> 34:20.853
and petri dishes

34:22.222 --> 34:24.725
is an atrocity.

34:24.757 --> 34:29.094
It's a violation
against humanity.

34:29.129 --> 34:31.764
And a decision
to put a stop to it

34:33.567 --> 34:36.036
is anything
but capricious.

34:50.350 --> 34:53.286
If a commission chooses
to shut down a research lab

34:53.319 --> 34:55.956
because people may protest,

34:55.989 --> 34:57.691
that's arbitrary.

34:57.724 --> 35:00.266
If you decide to close the doors
on medical progress

35:00.300 --> 35:02.903
that could save lives
because of the possibility

35:02.936 --> 35:05.405
of public outrage,

35:05.438 --> 35:06.740
that's capricious.

35:09.610 --> 35:11.244
There's been no violence here.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.446
No threats.
No indication of the danger

35:13.479 --> 35:15.749
the zoning board
says it's worried about.

35:15.782 --> 35:18.685
And the action by that board
had nothing to do

35:18.719 --> 35:20.286
with the risk
to public safety.

35:20.320 --> 35:22.689
And it's in bad faith
for them to even offer that

35:22.723 --> 35:23.990
as a pretext.

35:24.024 --> 35:26.827
This is government
shutting the door on an idea.

35:26.860 --> 35:28.662
We all know it.

35:28.695 --> 35:30.330
Mr. Davies knows.
You know it, Your Honor.

35:30.363 --> 35:33.299
Which is why he spent
the majority of his closing

35:33.333 --> 35:35.001
not on the merits,
but on religion,

35:35.035 --> 35:36.202
life's sanctity.

35:36.236 --> 35:37.938
It's irrelevant.

35:37.971 --> 35:40.040
FOX: The sanctity of life
is irrelevant to you, Counsel?

35:40.073 --> 35:43.243
Your Honor, since a year ago,

35:43.276 --> 35:45.445
every one of us
has become a lot more in touch

35:45.478 --> 35:47.180
with the sanctity
of human life.

35:47.213 --> 35:50.050
Nobody is more committed
to that sanctity

35:50.083 --> 35:51.317
than my clients.

35:51.351 --> 35:53.386
They do what they do

35:53.419 --> 35:55.922
to fight off diseases
that are killing us.

35:55.956 --> 35:58.324
And they don't need to be told
what is sacred

35:58.358 --> 36:00.026
by a city zoning board.

36:00.060 --> 36:02.068
There is nothing
remotely democratic

36:02.102 --> 36:03.504
about this abatement proceeding.

36:03.537 --> 36:07.307
And if the petitioner
is concerned about outrage,

36:09.876 --> 36:11.545
the reason abortion

36:11.578 --> 36:14.815
and the question of
"When does human life begin,"

36:14.848 --> 36:16.282
the reason this issue

36:16.316 --> 36:19.586
remains as combustible
as it does today,

36:20.754 --> 36:24.691
we the people
never got to decide it.

36:24.725 --> 36:26.026
It was done by fiat,

36:26.059 --> 36:27.628
by nine people sitting
on a bench,

36:27.661 --> 36:29.262
nine people nobody elected.

36:29.295 --> 36:30.997
Nobody voted
for Justice Blackmun.

36:31.031 --> 36:32.866
Nobody dropped the ballot
in the box

36:32.899 --> 36:35.001
and checked off the
name of John Paul Stevens.

36:35.035 --> 36:36.169
Now, you're getting off-track.

36:36.202 --> 36:37.538
YOUNG: No, I am not.

36:37.571 --> 36:40.807
Our most basic human value
was dictated to us by a Court.

36:40.841 --> 36:42.308
And Congress can't change it.

36:42.342 --> 36:43.677
A President can't change it.

36:43.710 --> 36:45.679
The people can't change it.

36:45.712 --> 36:48.615
We're bound
with no democratic recourse

36:48.649 --> 36:51.518
to even address it
because the Supreme Court says,

36:51.552 --> 36:54.254
"Let no electoral process
tear asunder."

36:54.287 --> 36:57.157
That's why the public
is still angry 30 years later,

36:57.190 --> 37:00.266
and that's why it remains
this country's civil war.

37:07.574 --> 37:10.376
I believe in God, Your Honor.

37:10.409 --> 37:13.079
As I do in the sanctity
of human life.

37:13.112 --> 37:15.214
But one sanctity of democracy

37:15.248 --> 37:18.484
is that we the people
enjoy religious

37:18.518 --> 37:20.053
and political freedom,

37:20.086 --> 37:22.823
and the liberty to decide
for ourselves

37:22.856 --> 37:23.957
what is sacred.

37:25.859 --> 37:27.027
Here we are today,

37:28.461 --> 37:31.131
with a city zoning board
running to a Court

37:31.164 --> 37:33.634
to impose its own idea

37:33.667 --> 37:36.737
of intrinsic human value.

37:40.674 --> 37:42.509
Let the protest begin.

37:59.526 --> 38:00.901
MAN: Be seated.

38:04.538 --> 38:08.509
Ms. Shipp, to be honest,
I wouldn't be thrilled

38:08.542 --> 38:12.513
to hear that sousa-sized voice
every morning.

38:12.546 --> 38:15.749
But, Mr. Emerson,
when I was buying my house,

38:15.782 --> 38:18.819
I asked my real estate broker
about privacy,

38:18.852 --> 38:21.955
and she said, "Oh, this is
a quiet neighborhood.

38:21.988 --> 38:23.624
You won't have to worry
about your neighbors

38:23.657 --> 38:26.827
getting all chummy
or throwing block parties.

38:26.860 --> 38:30.531
People here like
to keep to themselves."

38:30.564 --> 38:32.533
She said that
as a selling point,

38:32.566 --> 38:35.201
something to drive
the price higher.

38:38.539 --> 38:42.475
It's a sad day
when people go to Court

38:42.509 --> 38:46.479
to stop their neighbors
from singing.

38:46.513 --> 38:48.515
Your motion for a TRO is denied.

38:48.549 --> 38:50.617
I'm entering judgment
for the defendant.

38:50.651 --> 38:52.919
SHIPP: Oh, thank you.

38:52.953 --> 38:54.154
We're adjourned.

38:54.187 --> 38:55.055
(gavel bangs)

38:57.558 --> 39:00.967
Oh, and thank you so much.

39:01.001 --> 39:02.703
Congratulations.

39:02.736 --> 39:05.071
I just had such a feeling
about you.

39:08.609 --> 39:12.345
I loved it. It was so much fun
practicing again.

39:12.378 --> 39:14.480
(phone ringing)

39:14.515 --> 39:15.749
How'd it go?

39:15.782 --> 39:16.717
FRUTT: The Judge said
she'd rule

39:16.750 --> 39:17.483
by the end of the day.

39:17.518 --> 39:20.086
We finally gave up
and came back.

39:20.120 --> 39:23.023
Eugene was very good.

39:26.627 --> 39:28.428
HATCHER: The clerk's office
just called.

39:28.461 --> 39:31.264
Judge Fox denied the injunction.

39:31.297 --> 39:32.599
She did?

39:32.633 --> 39:33.767
We won?

39:33.800 --> 39:34.935
FRUTT: That's incredible.

39:36.402 --> 39:38.304
Eugene.
DONNELL: Ellenor,

39:40.841 --> 39:43.376
let me tell him, okay?

39:43.409 --> 39:44.244
Sure.

39:50.083 --> 39:52.686
(door opens)

39:54.120 --> 39:57.791
DONNELL: Clerk's office
just called.

39:57.824 --> 39:58.859
You won.

40:00.466 --> 40:01.367
We did?

40:02.435 --> 40:03.537
Congratulations.

40:03.570 --> 40:06.072
The girls said
you gave quite a closing.

40:07.641 --> 40:09.342
I don't know.

40:09.375 --> 40:11.411
Uh, I guess I spoke
from my center.

40:15.115 --> 40:16.116
(door closes)

40:17.684 --> 40:19.820
You misunderstood me,
Eugene.

40:21.655 --> 40:24.357
I consider you a man
of such heart

40:25.592 --> 40:27.027
and humanity,

40:30.564 --> 40:32.432
that's why
I worry about you.

40:35.636 --> 40:38.404
Anyway, congratulations.

40:39.673 --> 40:42.375
YOUNG: Bobby,

40:42.408 --> 40:44.678
you know the closing
the girls liked so much,

40:46.513 --> 40:50.651
I got up and argued the law

40:50.684 --> 40:52.653
like a religion.

40:53.253 --> 40:55.321
Yeah.

40:57.490 --> 41:00.767
And there you sit,

41:00.801 --> 41:02.135
the winner.

41:07.874 --> 41:08.809
(door opens)

41:11.444 --> 41:14.380
(music playing)

41:29.229 --> 41:30.496
WOMAN: Next on The Practice.

41:30.531 --> 41:34.034
This case isn't against
the Church or the priest.

41:34.067 --> 41:35.335
It's against the fellow victim.

41:35.368 --> 41:36.637
GRAYSON: It's against someone

41:36.670 --> 41:38.939
that could have prevented it
from happening to me.

41:38.972 --> 41:41.508
You can't try. There's the jury
will laugh at you.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.343
I think an under bias
is in play here.

41:43.376 --> 41:44.511
Excuse me.

41:44.545 --> 41:46.112
Eugene.
YOUNG: The man was raped.

41:46.146 --> 41:47.648
What kind of bias
allows for a person

41:47.681 --> 41:49.049
to see that is nothing?

41:49.650 --> 41:52.452
BALL: We had heard about this
alternative dispute resolution,

41:52.485 --> 41:55.088
where, you know,
like a lawyer,

41:55.121 --> 41:56.222
kind of, decides.

41:56.256 --> 41:57.858
It actually
isn't that simple.

41:57.891 --> 41:59.626
Each of you would have
to be represented

41:59.660 --> 42:00.801
by your own attorney.

42:00.834 --> 42:03.369
And the nature
of the household noises.

42:03.403 --> 42:04.304
Love-making.

42:08.408 --> 42:11.344
(music playing)

42:34.434 --> 42:35.435
WOMAN: You stinker.

42:35.969 --> 42:38.872
(music playing)
