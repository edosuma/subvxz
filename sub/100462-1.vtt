01:08.669 --> 01:10.669
<i> So, I know</i>
<i> what you're thinking.</i>

01:10.671 --> 01:13.072
<i> Why is that incredibly</i>
<i> handsome hedgehog</i>

01:13.074 --> 01:14.406
<i> being chased by a madman</i>

01:14.408 --> 01:16.475
<i> with a mustache</i>
<i> from the civil war?</i>

01:16.477 --> 01:20.546
<i> Well, to be honest,</i>
<i> it feels like I've been</i>
<i> running my whole life.</i>

01:20.548 --> 01:22.981
<i> Is this too much?</i>
<i> Am I going too fast?</i>

01:22.983 --> 01:26.118
<i>It's kind of what I do--</i>
<i>you know what? Let's back up.</i>

01:33.694 --> 01:36.762
<i> This is the island</i>
<i> where I'm from.</i>

01:37.398 --> 01:38.864
<i> It had everything.</i>

01:38.866 --> 01:41.400
<i> Sandy beaches,</i>
<i> cascading waterfalls,</i>

01:41.402 --> 01:43.368
<i>public access to loop-de-loops.</i>

01:43.370 --> 01:45.304
<i> And, I never had</i>
<i> to catch a school bus</i>

01:45.306 --> 01:47.773
<i>because I could run across</i>
<i>the entire island</i>

01:47.775 --> 01:49.475
<i>in less than two seconds.</i>

01:49.477 --> 01:51.343
<i>Also, there was no school.</i>

01:51.345 --> 01:53.745
<i>I know,</i>
<i>pretty sweet island, right?</i>

01:54.515 --> 01:55.647
Yeah!

01:55.649 --> 01:57.649
<i>I was born</i>
<i>with extraordinary powers</i>

01:57.651 --> 01:59.418
<i> and was told</i>
<i> to keep them secret.</i>

01:59.420 --> 02:02.187
<i> And like any kid,</i>
<i> I did the exact opposite.</i>

02:02.189 --> 02:03.555
Whoo-hoo!

02:04.758 --> 02:07.459
<i> That's longclaw.</i>
<i> She took care of me.</i>

02:07.461 --> 02:09.628
<i> She was basically</i>
<i> Obi-Wan Kenobi...</i>

02:09.630 --> 02:12.097
<i>If Obi-Wan Kenobi</i>
<i>had a beak and ate mice.</i>

02:12.099 --> 02:14.800
Sonic, someone
could have seen you.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.402
No one saw me. I'm too fast!

02:17.404 --> 02:19.605
And I wanted to bring you this.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.776
Get down!

02:28.182 --> 02:29.681
<i> Turns out,</i>
<i> with great power</i>

02:29.683 --> 02:31.917
<i> comes great</i>
<i> power-hungry bad guys.</i>

02:31.919 --> 02:34.219
<i>And I led them right to us.</i>

02:48.769 --> 02:51.303
Listen carefully, Sonic.

02:51.305 --> 02:54.339
You have a power unlike
anything I have ever seen.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.675
And that means someone
will always want it.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.746
The only way to stay safe
is to stay hidden.

03:03.918 --> 03:06.885
This world is on the far side
of the universe.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.187
You should be safe there.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.856
I don't want to go without you.
You must.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.592
These rings will be your most
important possession.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.132
If you're ever discovered,
use one.

03:20.134 --> 03:22.734
Never stop running.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.770
Now go!

03:28.309 --> 03:29.741
Longclaw!

03:31.145 --> 03:32.244
Goodbye, Sonic.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.412
No!

03:35.216 --> 03:37.349
No!

04:03.043 --> 04:04.710
Come on, one car?

04:14.788 --> 04:15.921
I'm bored.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.357
<i> Tom, do you read me?</i>
<i>Are you there?</i>

04:18.359 --> 04:21.727
No, Wade, I'm actually
on a yacht in Barbados.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.895
With Rihanna.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.364
OMG.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.099
That's amazing.
Please send pics.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.001
No, Wade.
I'm at the speed trap.

04:29.003 --> 04:32.404
Already?
How did you get back so fast?
Barbados is in the ocean!

04:32.406 --> 04:34.506
Hang on, I think
I got something.

04:41.348 --> 04:44.416
Hey, buddy! Where's the fire?

04:44.418 --> 04:46.518
Got kids living around here.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.487
I thought that was
kind of funny.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.055
Sorry.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.562
What?

05:36.136 --> 05:38.136
<i> Tom, we need you</i>
<i> down on main street.</i>

05:38.138 --> 05:40.272
<i> There's been a violent</i>
<i> gang shoot-out.</i>

05:42.109 --> 05:45.110
<i> Just kidding.</i>
<i> A duck stole a bagel.</i>

05:45.112 --> 05:47.479
<i>But they do need it back.</i>

05:57.891 --> 06:00.992
Whoa, buddy, you almost
got yourself killed out there.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.028
What are you,
some kind of adrenaline junkie?

06:03.030 --> 06:05.364
It must be rough
being slow all the time.

06:05.366 --> 06:08.667
Tell you what.
Today is your lucky day.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.171
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

06:13.173 --> 06:15.741
Have you ever felt so alive?

06:16.777 --> 06:19.444
This is great.
You're doing amazing.

06:19.446 --> 06:21.113
Oh, geez!

06:21.482 --> 06:23.515
Good recovery.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.851
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

06:25.853 --> 06:28.453
Let's keep this
our little secret, okay?

06:28.455 --> 06:31.656
You never saw me.
I was never here.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.706
<i> So what</i>
<i> were you expecting?</i>

06:47.708 --> 06:49.708
<i> A dirty little hedgehog</i>
<i> eating berries</i>

06:49.710 --> 06:51.843
<i> and struggling to survive?</i>

06:51.845 --> 06:56.448
<i>Think again. Because I am</i>
<i>living my best life on earth.</i>

06:56.450 --> 06:58.483
<i> I've got a library...</i>

06:59.620 --> 07:01.286
<i> A home gym,</i>

07:01.288 --> 07:04.156
<i> and a state-of-the-art</i>
<i> security system.</i>

07:16.270 --> 07:17.569
Oh, no.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.971
<i>And, if I'm ever discovered,</i>

07:19.973 --> 07:21.706
<i> I'll follow</i>
<i> longclaw's instructions</i>

07:21.708 --> 07:25.010
<i> and use my rings</i>
<i> to escape to a new planet.</i>

07:25.012 --> 07:29.214
<i>A nice, safe little world</i>
<i>filled only with mushrooms.</i>

07:30.451 --> 07:33.685
<i>Gross, smelly mushrooms.</i>

07:34.354 --> 07:36.188
I hate mushrooms.

07:37.191 --> 07:39.524
<i> But let's not worry</i>
<i> about all that.</i>

07:39.526 --> 07:41.893
<i> This is green hills.</i>

07:41.895 --> 07:44.162
<i>The greatest place on earth.</i>

07:45.365 --> 07:47.766
<i>These are my people and,</i>
<i>dare I say,</i>

07:47.768 --> 07:50.168
<i>I am their</i>
<i>lovable space creature.</i>

07:50.170 --> 07:52.971
<i> So what if they</i>
<i> don't know I exist?</i>

07:54.041 --> 07:57.676
<i> My favorite person</i>
<i> is the donut lord.</i>

07:58.312 --> 08:00.645
<i>Protector of this town</i>

08:00.647 --> 08:03.849
<i>and defender of all creatures,</i>
<i>big and small.</i>

08:03.851 --> 08:04.716
Morning.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.818
Donald. Daisy. Daffy.

08:07.721 --> 08:10.822
<i> Donut lord lives</i>
<i> with pretzel lady.</i>

08:10.824 --> 08:12.557
<i>She is super nice to animals</i>

08:12.559 --> 08:16.194
<i> and strangely was born</i>
<i> without bones.</i>

08:16.196 --> 08:17.662
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.498
<i>There is one person in town</i>

08:19.500 --> 08:20.899
<i>who's actually onto me.</i>

08:20.901 --> 08:23.335
<i> He calls me the blue devil.</i>

08:23.337 --> 08:25.303
I almost caught him last night.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.239
<i> Say hello to crazy Carl</i>

08:30.711 --> 08:32.544
<i> we have fun together.</i>

08:33.847 --> 08:36.515
I know you're out there!

08:36.517 --> 08:39.518
And I know you're real!

08:39.520 --> 08:42.220
No, I'm not!

08:42.222 --> 08:44.155
<i>Movie night is my favorite.</i>

08:44.157 --> 08:46.958
Please, please,
please, please, please.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.393
Yes! Keanu!

08:48.395 --> 08:49.961
You are a national treasure.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.531
<i> When I find you--</i>
<i> pop quiz, hotshot.</i>

08:52.533 --> 08:54.399
<i> There's a bomb on a bus.</i>

08:54.401 --> 08:56.368
"Pop quiz, hotshot."

08:56.370 --> 08:58.069
It's a classic line.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.872
<i> Basically,</i>
<i> we're like a family.</i>

09:00.874 --> 09:02.707
<i>Even though we haven't met yet.</i>

09:02.709 --> 09:04.709
You don't zink your

09:04.711 --> 09:07.379
prolonged isolation is making
you a bit crazy perhaps?

09:07.381 --> 09:09.381
Crazy? Me?

09:09.383 --> 09:11.917
No way, doc.
You got me all wrong.

09:11.919 --> 09:16.288
And despite all these so-called
friends of yours, deep down...

09:16.290 --> 09:18.823
...you're still rather lonely?

09:23.997 --> 09:27.832
<i>Perhaps afraid</i>
<i>you'll be alone forever?</i>

09:41.748 --> 09:45.617
Uh-uh. Hey!
No, no, no, no.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.385
Get out of there. Come on.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.721
Oh, come on! Get out of there!

09:49.723 --> 09:52.357
Get out of there,
you trash pandas.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.428
Maddie, as green hills'
most respected veterinarian,

09:56.430 --> 09:59.731
what is the fastest way
to exterminate a raccoon?

09:59.733 --> 10:02.367
Hi, ozzy. Hello!
You're glad to see me.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.802
You don't eat garbage, do you?

10:04.504 --> 10:06.171
What's that?

10:06.173 --> 10:09.741
Is that what I think it is?
Uh-huh. Open it.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.676
Oh, it's kind of small.
Is that bad?

10:11.678 --> 10:13.745
Just open it.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.118
"Dear Thomas:

10:20.120 --> 10:21.586
We have reviewed
your application

10:21.588 --> 10:23.054
to the San Francisco
police department,

10:23.056 --> 10:24.789
and pending
interdepartmental review

10:24.791 --> 10:27.025
and background check,
we are happy to inform you

10:27.027 --> 10:29.060
that you have been selected
to join our team."

10:29.062 --> 10:31.062
Oh, my god!
Wow.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.031
Oh, my god.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.633
Ta-da!

10:35.268 --> 10:37.335
"San Francisco sucks."

10:37.337 --> 10:39.237
Oh!

10:39.239 --> 10:40.338
Wrong one!

10:42.442 --> 10:44.476
Ta-da!

10:45.212 --> 10:48.346
You never had a doubt, huh?
No! Mm-mmm.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.918
I can't believe this.
Oh, I know! You did it.

10:55.389 --> 10:57.022
Hey, what are those?

10:57.924 --> 11:00.291
Apartments for rent
I found on zillow.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.894
I thought ozzy and I
could fly there tomorrow

11:02.896 --> 11:06.031
and check out
some neighborhoods.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.900
I mean,
this is all happening so fast.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.703
Oh, man...
It's the craziest thing.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.972
You apply for the job,
you get the job.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.640
Well, pending
a background check.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.709
Oh, man.
Hope they don't find out about

11:17.711 --> 11:20.178
that time you used
the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.414
Correction: I'm still using
the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.783
But, maddie,

11:24.785 --> 11:26.418
are you sure
you're okay with this?

11:26.420 --> 11:28.319
Thomas Michael wachowski,

11:28.321 --> 11:30.855
what did you do the entire time
I was in veterinary school?

11:30.857 --> 11:33.458
I worked a second job
to pay the rent and--

11:33.460 --> 11:35.293
a third job to pay tuition.

11:35.295 --> 11:39.030
You sacrificed for me.
I'm happy to sacrifice for you.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.001
Babe, are you sure
you're okay with this?

11:44.004 --> 11:46.504
I mean, there's been
a wachowski protecting this town

11:46.506 --> 11:48.740
for more than 50 years.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.109
This is a big change.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.945
I'm positive.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.881
It's time for this guy to
get out there and prove himself.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.850
I love green hills, but,

11:58.852 --> 12:00.719
you know, I want to help
people in real trouble.

12:00.721 --> 12:04.089
I want someone to turn to me
in a life-and-death situation

12:04.091 --> 12:05.890
and I'll be there for 'em.

12:06.660 --> 12:07.826
I get it.

12:07.828 --> 12:11.062
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.130
Mmm!

12:12.132 --> 12:13.932
And so it is with a heavy heart,

12:13.934 --> 12:16.067
that I tell you all
that I've accepted a position

12:16.069 --> 12:18.002
at the San Francisco
police department,

12:18.004 --> 12:19.838
effective immediately.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.740
It's gonna be tough
to leave my hometown

12:21.742 --> 12:23.541
and all my friendships.

12:23.543 --> 12:27.445
But this is something
I feel like I need to do...

12:27.447 --> 12:28.913
To grow...

12:28.915 --> 12:32.817
As both an officer and a man.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.122
What do you think,
sergeant sprinkles?

12:37.858 --> 12:39.924
That wasn't so bad, right?

12:40.861 --> 12:42.961
Now all I got to do is...

12:43.697 --> 12:45.630
Tell everyone
who isn't a donut.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.934
Whoa, the playoffs!

13:33.313 --> 13:36.214
Oh! So cool.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.120
Bottom of the ninth,
tie score.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.822
And exactly who you want
at the plate

13:43.824 --> 13:45.824
with the game
on the line: Sonic!

13:45.826 --> 13:47.525
But staring him down
from the pitcher's mound

13:47.527 --> 13:50.962
is the most fearsome southpaw
in green hills:

13:50.964 --> 13:52.330
Also Sonic.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.532
Okay. Focus, Sonic.
If you win this game,

13:54.534 --> 13:57.235
you'll be the most beloved kid
in green hills.

14:01.641 --> 14:05.143
Hit it to the guy in left!
He's a real space case.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.048
I can't with that guy.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.649
Hey, batter Sonic.
Hey, batter Sonic.

14:11.651 --> 14:14.452
"Suh-wing," batter Sonic.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.461
I got it, I got it, I got it!

14:24.397 --> 14:25.897
I don't got it.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.641
Go home! Go home!

14:36.910 --> 14:38.509
Come on!

14:43.450 --> 14:44.482
Safe!

14:46.319 --> 14:49.387
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes! I did it!

14:49.389 --> 14:52.523
Did you see that?
I did it. I did it.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.572
I really am alone.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.009
All alone. Forever.

15:44.911 --> 15:48.513
I'm sure no one noticed that
giant blue explosion, right?

15:58.725 --> 16:00.258
Hey, Wade.
Hi, Tom.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.093
Uh, Wade here.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.895
What is going on?

16:03.897 --> 16:05.330
Well, gosh,
I think the power's out.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.265
Yeah, no dur!
The lights are out.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.233
The whole town is freaking out.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.302
- What should I do?
<i>- Okay, relax.</i>

16:11.304 --> 16:13.237
Take a deep breath, call Gil,

16:13.239 --> 16:15.974
see if they can locate
the downed line, then...

16:15.976 --> 16:18.977
Call zim and see if he can
get his generator
over to the super q

16:18.979 --> 16:20.278
so the food stays... fresh.

16:20.280 --> 16:24.148
<i> Call zim before Gil?</i>

16:24.150 --> 16:26.551
<i>Call Gil-- hello?</i>
I'll call you back.

16:26.553 --> 16:29.020
Wait! Hello? Was that
the end of the instructions?

16:30.323 --> 16:33.424
Okay, all right.
Uh, you can do this.

16:33.426 --> 16:37.595
What was the first thing
he said to do?

16:39.032 --> 16:41.399
Right. Relax.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.354
Twenty minutes ago,
an energy surge

17:03.356 --> 17:06.090
knocked out power across
the entire pacific northwest.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.392
What do we know?

17:07.394 --> 17:10.361
Well, our first instinct
was it was an emp.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.231
But electromagnetic pulses
don't have that kind of power.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.767
NASA has ruled out
meteor strikes or solar flares.

17:15.769 --> 17:18.369
The department of energy says
it's not a power plant
malfunction.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.971
Well, sounds like
we're really good

17:19.973 --> 17:21.339
at figuring out
what it wasn't.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.641
This could be a prelude
to a larger attack.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.877
I'm suggesting we scramble
the fifth and sixth regiment.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.178
No, no, no, no.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.680
This needs a much more
sophisticated mind.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.582
Someone who
understands technology.

17:31.584 --> 17:34.652
You want to send in a lab rat?
Not just any lab rat.

17:34.654 --> 17:35.920
A lab rat with teeth.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.322
You're not suggesting
who I think you're suggesting.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.191
I know,
he's a little weird.
Weird?

17:40.193 --> 17:42.693
No. No way.
He's a psychological tire fire!

17:42.695 --> 17:46.297
But he's also brilliant.
Five phds, IQ off the charts.

17:46.299 --> 17:49.100
And his drone tech
is revolutionary!

17:49.102 --> 17:51.069
You're sure he can handle this?

17:51.071 --> 17:53.071
He has a perfect
operations record.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.073
Remember the coup in Pakistan?
No.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.507
Or the uprising
in azerbaijanistan?

17:56.509 --> 17:58.643
That's not even a country.
Exactly.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.878
And you can thank
robotnik for that.

18:00.880 --> 18:04.248
I can't believe you're
bringing that freak into this.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.818
Neither can I, but...

18:07.654 --> 18:09.053
We have no choice.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.680
What the...

18:57.504 --> 18:59.070
Are you in charge here?

18:59.072 --> 19:00.271
Yes, I am--
nope!

19:00.273 --> 19:01.339
My--
wrong!

19:01.341 --> 19:02.807
Name--
I'm in charge!

19:02.809 --> 19:04.142
Is major--
me!

19:04.144 --> 19:06.477
Ben--
I'm in charge.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.547
You've never seen
anything like this before.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.582
It says
I'm the top banana

19:11.584 --> 19:14.318
in a world full
of hungry
little monkeys.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.687
Allow me to clarify.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.156
In a sequentially
ranked hierarchy

19:18.158 --> 19:19.557
based on level
of critical importance,

19:19.559 --> 19:21.659
the disparity between us
is too vast to quantify.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.162
Agent stone?
The doctor thinks you're basic.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.297
I'm initiating a sweep sequence.

19:26.299 --> 19:29.033
Ten miles in every direction
should suffice.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.570
Is he still looking at me funny?
Yes, he is.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.405
Tell him to stop
or I'll pull up
his search history.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.240
If you don't stop looking
at the doctor,

19:36.242 --> 19:37.842
he'll take a closer look--
I'm not deaf.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.744
And tell him his men
report to me now.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.045
Blah-blah-blah.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.714
Excuse me? Listen, pal,
I don't know if you realize--

19:43.716 --> 19:45.850
I'm sorry, major.
What was your name?

19:45.852 --> 19:48.352
Benning--
nobody cares!

19:48.354 --> 19:51.822
Nobody cares. Listen,
major nobody cares.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.125
You know why
nobody cares who you are?

19:54.127 --> 19:56.694
Because nobody cares about
your feeble accomplishments.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.664
And nobody cares
how proud your mommy is

19:59.666 --> 20:02.333
that you're now reading
at a third-grade level.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.569
Mmm.
Have you finished
<i>Charlotte's web </i> yet?

20:04.571 --> 20:06.837
Spoiler alert:
She dies in the end.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.140
But she leaves
a big creepy egg sac.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.611
Ah... my babies.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.681
Whoo! Look what came out
of my egg sac.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.550
You know what I love
about machines?

20:19.552 --> 20:23.254
They do what they're told.
They follow their programming.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.456
They don't need time off
to get drunk

20:25.458 --> 20:27.325
and put the boat in the water.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.060
Now you do what you're told.

20:29.062 --> 20:32.129
Stand over there on the edge
of your personal abyss...

20:32.832 --> 20:35.399
And watch my machines
do your job.

20:37.704 --> 20:40.338
Can you feel it, stone?
I can feel it, doctor.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.774
It's evolution, stone.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.343
It's evolution!

21:21.080 --> 21:23.247
Agent stone?
Doctor.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.449
Do you see anything useful
in this image?

21:26.386 --> 21:29.053
Nothing at all, doctor.
Of course you don't.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.222
Your eyes weren't
expertly trained to spot tracks

21:31.224 --> 21:33.958
by the native-American
shadow wolves.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.036
That's extraordinary.

21:45.038 --> 21:47.738
No. What's extraordinary is,

21:47.740 --> 21:49.740
I've determined
the exact height, weight

21:49.742 --> 21:51.442
and spinal curvature
of this creature,

21:51.444 --> 21:53.911
and my computer
can't find a single match for it

21:53.913 --> 21:56.847
anywhere in earth's
animal kingdom.

21:57.617 --> 22:00.084
This blackout
was not a terrorist attack,

22:00.086 --> 22:02.286
and that's no baby bigfoot.

22:02.288 --> 22:05.990
This guy is something else...

22:07.093 --> 22:08.793
Entirely.

22:08.795 --> 22:11.862
Divert all search units
to the site of the footprint.

22:12.565 --> 22:15.232
That's one small step for man,

22:15.234 --> 22:17.768
one giant leap for me.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.748
Okay, okay, everything is fine.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.883
You played some baseball,
got a little upset,

22:32.885 --> 22:36.153
lightning shot out of your butt,
and now they're coming for you.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.256
All right, all right.
Earth isn't safe anymore.

22:39.258 --> 22:41.058
Time for plan b.
Mushroomville.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.961
But I gotta take my stuff.
Okay, essential items only.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.497
Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste,
hair gel, night-light.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.599
Funny hat.
This half-eaten cantaloupe.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.568
Oh, and my scented candle.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.703
My entire comic book collection.
Bean bag chair.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.438
Can a bean bag chair
fit in a backpack?

22:54.440 --> 22:56.173
No, no, no.
Of course not.
That's stupid.

22:56.175 --> 23:00.511
Okay, what else? The rings!
The rings, yes, of course.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.813
Here we go. Ring time.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.449
Mushroom planet, here I come.

23:05.451 --> 23:06.784
Oh, no.
They're right outside.

23:06.786 --> 23:09.887
I gotta go somewhere else.

23:13.292 --> 23:15.126
Goodbye, cave.

23:19.132 --> 23:20.931
- Hey.
- <i> Hey.</i>

23:20.933 --> 23:21.932
Whatcha doing?

23:21.934 --> 23:24.468
Just coloring
with jojo and Rachel.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.604
Ah, that sounds...
Half-fun.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.806
Hey, exciting stuff here.
We had a power outage.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.775
The whole town went dark.

23:30.777 --> 23:33.110
It was like a sign telling me
to get out of dodge.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.413
Wade must have lost his mind.
<i> Yeah.</i>

23:35.415 --> 23:37.815
And he does not
have much to lose.

23:37.817 --> 23:40.384
How's your sister?
Did she convince you
to leave me yet?

23:40.386 --> 23:43.854
No, but she did tell me
to check your phone
for dating apps.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.990
<i>The only apps on my phone</i>
<i>are the ones that came with it.</i>

23:45.992 --> 23:48.025
- And the olive garden.
- <i> Ah.</i>

23:48.027 --> 23:50.060
Because when you're there...
You're family.

23:52.365 --> 23:53.898
No way.

23:56.269 --> 23:57.568
The raccoons are back.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.537
And they are in for a surprise.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.139
Your surprise better not be
my tranquilizer gun.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.207
They're just hungry.

24:03.209 --> 24:06.577
<i>And also, that's for bears.</i>

24:06.579 --> 24:08.879
Good. Now I know it'll work.
<i> Tom!</i>

24:08.881 --> 24:11.248
I'm kidding. I'm just gonna
use it to scare 'em.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.516
Possibly to death.

24:12.518 --> 24:13.851
<i> Love you, honey, bye!</i>
Tom--

24:18.558 --> 24:21.058
d-i-v-o-r-c-e.

24:23.329 --> 24:24.695
Okay, I'm in.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.631
With minimal damage
to donut lord's property.

24:28.267 --> 24:29.600
Here we go.

24:29.602 --> 24:30.935
It didn't work out on earth,
but that's okay.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.436
You're going to a safe world.

24:32.438 --> 24:34.905
A nice, safe world
full of mushrooms.

24:34.907 --> 24:38.309
Mushrooms that'll be
your only friends.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.110
That sounds awful.
I can't do this.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.646
You have to do it.
There's no other option.

24:43.349 --> 24:45.716
All right.

24:47.019 --> 24:49.453
Sfpd...
Pending background check.

24:49.455 --> 24:51.155
Paws in the air!

24:52.859 --> 24:55.426
Uh, meow?

25:00.800 --> 25:02.132
Ow!

25:03.703 --> 25:07.104
"San... Francisco?"

25:29.128 --> 25:31.829
No.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.901
What?

25:59.125 --> 26:00.958
The blue devil.

26:13.806 --> 26:16.273
Donut lord?
It can talk.

26:16.709 --> 26:17.942
You're not...

26:17.944 --> 26:19.343
You're not here
to abduct me, are you?

26:19.345 --> 26:20.978
You abducted me.

26:22.148 --> 26:24.548
Okay, that's a fair point.
What are you?

26:24.550 --> 26:26.483
Why are you hiding out
in my garage?

26:26.485 --> 26:28.018
I needed somewhere safe.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.187
And you're the only person
I could think of, donut lord.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.689
Why do you keep
calling me donut lord?

26:31.691 --> 26:33.057
'Cause you talk to donuts.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.292
And then eat them
if they get out of line.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.660
Again, fair.

26:36.662 --> 26:37.895
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are all the mushrooms?

26:37.897 --> 26:39.597
Why am I still on earth?
What is--

26:39.599 --> 26:42.433
oh, no!
I lost my rings.

26:42.435 --> 26:43.734
What?

26:49.375 --> 26:52.209
What's happening?
Is this your mother ship?

26:52.845 --> 26:54.345
I'm not in the mood
to get probed.

26:54.347 --> 26:57.281
You think you're worried?
I'm not even wearing pants.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.853
What the...

27:02.855 --> 27:05.889
They're coming for me!
Who's coming for you?

27:05.891 --> 27:07.925
What's that got to do with me?
I don't have time to explain,

27:07.927 --> 27:09.193
but you have to help me.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.128
No, I don't. Why?

27:11.130 --> 27:13.731
Well, my legs,
which normally
would be classified

27:13.733 --> 27:15.966
as lethal weapons,
feel like spaghetti.

27:15.968 --> 27:19.103
I need your help. Please.
It's life or death.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.712
Fine. Come with me.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.417
Uh, little help?

27:44.563 --> 27:46.563
All right, stay here.
And be quiet.

27:46.565 --> 27:47.831
Good plan. Great plan!

27:47.833 --> 27:49.233
We're already working
so well together.

27:49.235 --> 27:52.102
Practically finishing
each other's sentences.

27:53.239 --> 27:54.705
Okay, bye.

27:57.743 --> 27:59.276
Hello there!

27:59.879 --> 28:01.278
Can I help you?

28:04.817 --> 28:07.518
Good morning,
my rural chum.

28:07.520 --> 28:11.321
I'm... from the power company,
investigating the blackout.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.323
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take a few readings

28:13.325 --> 28:14.792
inside your house?

28:14.794 --> 28:16.393
No kidding?
You're from
the power company?

28:16.395 --> 28:18.095
Mmm.
Oh, you must know
my buddy Spencer.

28:18.097 --> 28:21.131
We play softball together.
Ah! Spence.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.834
He's a good man.

28:23.836 --> 28:26.637
Yeah. Come on in!
Great.

28:26.639 --> 28:28.205
Take all the readings you need.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.973
Except, uh...

28:29.975 --> 28:32.976
Doesn't the power company
usually take their readings
from outside the house?

28:32.978 --> 28:35.813
That way they can check them
even if you're not home.

28:35.815 --> 28:38.148
Also, my buddy Spencer
works for the gas company,

28:38.150 --> 28:39.883
and he's more of
an ultimate frisbee guy.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.653
So you want to tell me
why you think I'm dumb enough

28:42.655 --> 28:44.388
to just let you
walk inside my house?

28:52.965 --> 28:55.499
I'm sorry, mister...
Wachowski.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.267
But everyone calls me Tom.

28:57.269 --> 28:59.236
Except my dentist,
he calls me Tim.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.838
But it's gone on
for so long now

29:00.840 --> 29:02.940
that it would just be weird
if I corrected him.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.175
Well, Tom, whose-dentist-
calls-him-Tim.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.211
You may have noticed
that this entire town

29:07.213 --> 29:09.012
has been experiencing
a power outage.

29:09.014 --> 29:10.914
Yep, no lights.
Picked up on that.

29:10.916 --> 29:14.051
Twenty minutes ago,
I tracked an energy pulse
with a similar signature

29:14.053 --> 29:16.420
to the one that caused
that disruption.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.270
Listen, uh, mister...

29:33.272 --> 29:34.438
Doctor.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.441
Dr. Robotnik.
But my dentist calls me Rob.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.076
Hmm.

29:39.078 --> 29:42.446
Look, uh, Dr. Robotskeez.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.782
Um, I'm sure
what you're here for
is very serious,

29:44.784 --> 29:46.150
but it's got nothing
to do with me.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.651
You can ask anyone in town.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.686
Everyone knows me.
I bet they do.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.054
I'm sure you're hella popular

29:51.056 --> 29:52.956
with the jebs and merles
and Billy Bobs,

29:52.958 --> 29:55.492
in this glorified
gas-station rest stop.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.861
Betcha go way back
to the days of tippin' cows

29:57.863 --> 29:59.863
and playin' in a jug band!

30:02.768 --> 30:05.569
And maybe someday
you'll achieve your goal

30:05.571 --> 30:08.372
of getting a costco card
or adopting a labradoodle.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.841
But the reality is,
I surpassed

30:10.843 --> 30:14.344
everything you're
ever going to do...

30:15.815 --> 30:17.614
Before I was a toddler.

30:17.616 --> 30:21.552
I was spitting out formulas
while you were
still spitting up formula.

30:21.554 --> 30:22.920
I was breastfed,
actually.

30:22.922 --> 30:26.223
Nice.
Rub that in my orphan face.

30:26.892 --> 30:29.126
Mr. Wachowski,
are you familiar with

30:29.128 --> 30:32.796
us code 904,
title 10, article 104?

30:33.332 --> 30:35.332
Yeah, who isn't--
"anyone...

30:35.334 --> 30:39.236
Who attempts to aid an enemy
of the United States
shall suffer death."

30:40.272 --> 30:42.973
And if I'm the one
that catches you,

30:42.975 --> 30:44.441
it'll be even worse.

30:46.412 --> 30:47.744
Worse than death?

30:49.949 --> 30:51.381
Okay, I'm a ball,
a normal ball.

30:51.383 --> 30:52.983
I'm blending in like a ball.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.351
Shh. Stop talking.
No, <i> you </i> stop talking.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.386
Be quiet, Sonic.
<i> You </i> be quiet, Sonic.

30:56.388 --> 30:59.122
Oh, I hope they aren't
scanning me with x-rays.

30:59.124 --> 31:01.225
I had kind of
an embarrassing lunch.

31:09.001 --> 31:11.401
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.

31:11.403 --> 31:14.204
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.907
I'm freaking out!

31:18.410 --> 31:20.844
Why don't you have
your staircase carpeted?

31:20.846 --> 31:23.013
Compared to what i--

31:25.517 --> 31:27.084
old pipes.
Yeah.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.719
Probably just
the house settling.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.554
Nothing to see here!

31:31.657 --> 31:32.990
Hey!

31:37.963 --> 31:39.596
Here's the thing.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.066
I'm never wrong.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.669
Well, first time
for everything, I guess.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.037
Would you like some cake?

31:47.039 --> 31:48.472
I hear raccoons have
the cleanest mouths

31:48.474 --> 31:50.507
of any animal that
routinely eats garbage.

32:02.755 --> 32:04.554
Look at that.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.924
I was right.

32:06.926 --> 32:09.192
Note the lack of surprise.

32:09.194 --> 32:10.994
Shall we try this again?

32:21.273 --> 32:24.808
I'm going to give you
five seconds
to tell me where it is.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.076
Five...

32:26.078 --> 32:27.277
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.445
Four.
Hey, tough guy.
I'm a cop,

32:28.447 --> 32:30.047
and you're
threatening an officer.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.349
How can you threaten somebody
who never existed?

32:32.351 --> 32:33.750
Three...

32:33.752 --> 32:35.485
Come on!
Rack your brain.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.921
You might be able to come up
with some lame excuse

32:37.923 --> 32:40.557
to go on living
in two...

32:41.460 --> 32:42.592
One.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.728
Wait! Don't hurt him!

32:58.577 --> 33:00.310
This feels excessive.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.148
Stay behind me.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.130
Hiya!

33:21.066 --> 33:23.500
Don't worry. I got it
right where I want it!

33:26.038 --> 33:29.573
Can you believe Amazon
is gonna deliver packages
with these things?

33:32.044 --> 33:35.145
This was a horrible plan!
What was I thinking?

33:37.182 --> 33:39.082
I'm gonna puke!

33:42.955 --> 33:45.655
Come on!
We gotta get out of here.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.858
Oh, don't tell me
that's all you got!

33:47.860 --> 33:49.359
I'm just getting started!

33:49.361 --> 33:51.661
Let me know if you want to go
round two with the blue.

34:11.016 --> 34:13.250
Doctor! Are you okay?

34:13.252 --> 34:15.852
I saw a guy race out of here
and thought--

34:15.854 --> 34:17.721
that you should
stop them?

34:18.657 --> 34:20.257
Open your mouth...

34:20.259 --> 34:22.259
And say you thought that you
should stop them.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.094
No, I thought that maybe
I should check

34:24.096 --> 34:25.862
to see if you were okay--

34:25.864 --> 34:28.498
you know what's hard about being
the smartest person
in the world?

34:28.500 --> 34:31.902
Everyone else seems stupid.
Stupid, yes! Way to go!

34:31.904 --> 34:33.303
You got that one.

34:34.573 --> 34:38.575
Whatever this creature is,
it's our job to secure it,

34:38.577 --> 34:42.779
neutralize it,
uncover the source of its power.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.414
And if it resists,

34:45.150 --> 34:46.683
we take it apart...

34:47.252 --> 34:49.152
Piece by piece.

34:50.022 --> 34:51.788
See what makes it tick.

34:52.991 --> 34:54.324
Stone?
Doctor?

34:54.326 --> 34:56.827
Call optical illusions.

34:56.829 --> 34:59.096
Tell them I need new frames.

34:59.098 --> 35:01.231
They know what kind I like.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.800
Oh, and bring that quill.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.403
Yes, doctor.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.574
All right, pal,

35:10.576 --> 35:12.209
you need to start talking
right now.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.611
Who are you? What are you?

35:14.613 --> 35:17.380
I'm a hedgehog!
I feel like that's obvious.

35:17.382 --> 35:20.083
And I'm in big trouble.
Oh, <i> you're </i> in big trouble?

35:20.085 --> 35:22.619
You're not the one who punched
some sort of government
weirdo back there.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.522
You think <i> you </i> have problems?
I lost my rings.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.090
Rings?
What are you talking about?

35:27.092 --> 35:29.693
Okay. Rings are how
all advanced cultures

35:29.695 --> 35:31.161
travel between worlds.

35:31.163 --> 35:33.597
And now mine are
on top of a pointy building

35:33.599 --> 35:37.167
I've only ever seen
on your skintight t-shirt.
Hey.

35:37.169 --> 35:39.202
So, I'd like you to take me
to San Francisco,

35:39.204 --> 35:41.104
so I can get back my rings
and use them

35:41.106 --> 35:42.706
to go to the mushroom planet.

35:44.076 --> 35:46.376
Mushroom planet.
Yes!

35:46.912 --> 35:48.345
Right.

35:51.717 --> 35:54.484
Okay, pal, out you go.
I'm sorry, what?

35:54.486 --> 35:56.486
Look, this is
the worst possible time

35:56.488 --> 35:58.455
for me to get myself
into trouble, okay?

35:58.457 --> 36:00.624
You asked me to save your life,
I saved your life.

36:00.626 --> 36:03.827
Now, please, go find your rings.
And your mushroom land.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.629
Hopefully I'm gonna wake up
in a hospital bed

36:05.631 --> 36:07.731
and the doctor's gonna tell me
that my colonoscopy

36:07.733 --> 36:10.000
was a big success, okay?
So goodbye.

36:10.002 --> 36:13.303
Okay. Goodbye.
Goodbye.

36:15.140 --> 36:18.375
Why aren't you leaving?
I don't know where
San Francisco is.

36:18.377 --> 36:19.509
It's west.
West?

36:19.511 --> 36:20.844
Straight shot, can't miss it.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.045
Fine. That's cool.

36:22.047 --> 36:24.181
I'm totally cool
saying goodbye now.

36:28.720 --> 36:33.190
So, as I crashed into the cold,
dark water of the pacific,

36:33.192 --> 36:35.559
I realized a few things.

36:35.561 --> 36:38.061
A, I have no idea
where I'm going.

36:38.063 --> 36:40.130
B, saltwater stings.

36:40.132 --> 36:44.834
C, I shouldn't even be on
this planet right now, but I am.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.803
Why? Because you shot me!

36:46.805 --> 36:48.605
I know.
You shot me!

36:48.607 --> 36:50.307
All right, I heard you
the first time.

36:50.309 --> 36:53.009
You don't have to pile it on.
Good grief.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.979
I'm wet. I'm cold.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.747
There's a fish on my head!

36:57.749 --> 37:01.418
And clearly, I'm not gonna
be able to do this on my own.

37:05.691 --> 37:08.425
All right,
get in the truck.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.227
Really? You're gonna help me?

37:10.229 --> 37:12.829
I guess it is a little bit
my fault that all this
is happening to you.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.999
Not a little bit. Entirely.
It is entirely your fault.

37:16.001 --> 37:18.635
Okay, it's entirely my fault.
Are you coming?

37:18.637 --> 37:19.769
Yes.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.540
Road trip! Whoop-whoop!

37:23.542 --> 37:25.542
What am I doing?

37:26.545 --> 37:28.278
All right, there's
gonna be rules on this trip.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.214
Number one, do exactly
as I say all the time.

37:31.216 --> 37:33.350
Got it?
Got it, donut lord.

37:33.352 --> 37:35.919
Would you stop
with the "donut lord"?

37:35.921 --> 37:37.687
I have a name. It's Tom.

37:38.123 --> 37:39.155
I'm Sonic.

37:39.157 --> 37:41.725
Sonic. Sonic.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.328
So you've been
spying on us all for years.

37:45.330 --> 37:46.796
I wouldn't call it "spying."

37:46.798 --> 37:49.399
We were all just hanging out,
only I wasn't invited

37:49.401 --> 37:50.834
and no one knew I was there.

37:50.836 --> 37:53.236
I can't believe crazy Carl
was right all this time.

37:53.238 --> 37:56.506
Yeah. You should call him
super observant Carl instead.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.609
Oh, my god,
stop the car right now!
What? What?

37:59.611 --> 38:02.012
The world's largest
rubberband ball?

38:02.014 --> 38:04.047
We gotta see it!
No. No.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.850
No, this is not some
fun family road trip, okay?

38:06.852 --> 38:09.085
The government wants
to dissect you.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.920
And arrest me. This is serious.

38:12.257 --> 38:13.823
Eh, you're right, it was lame.

38:13.825 --> 38:16.426
Gift shop was cool, though.
I got you a mouse pad.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.228
When are we gonna get there?

38:18.230 --> 38:20.597
We will get there
when we get there.

38:39.251 --> 38:42.352
I'm gonna go check in with Wade,
see if he knows what's going on.

38:42.354 --> 38:44.821
You're gonna see Wade
in that glass thing?

38:44.823 --> 38:46.956
What is it, a teleportation box?

38:48.593 --> 38:50.593
It's a pay phone.
It's mostly for drug dealers

38:50.595 --> 38:53.096
and fugitives from the law,
which is us.

38:53.098 --> 38:55.065
Stay in the car.
I don't want anybody
seeing you.

38:55.067 --> 38:57.334
Fine.

39:07.979 --> 39:08.978
Huh?

39:16.555 --> 39:18.421
Okay, okay.
That is the coolest
place on earth,

39:18.423 --> 39:20.523
but you have to stay in the car.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.502
Be strong. Be strong.

39:35.207 --> 39:36.506
Hmm.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.511
Hello.
Green hills police department.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.380
Wade, it's me.
<i> Hi.</i>

39:43.382 --> 39:44.781
I'm so glad that you called.

39:44.783 --> 39:47.484
Uh, so, some guys came in
asking some questions.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.085
Uh, they're a little creepy.

39:49.087 --> 39:51.888
Kind of reminded me of
the guys from <i> men in black,</i>

39:51.890 --> 39:55.392
but not as likable
or charming as will Smith.

39:55.394 --> 39:56.793
Wait, what kind of questions?

39:56.795 --> 40:00.063
Um, questions about terrorism?

40:00.065 --> 40:03.433
I told them that I've gone
ice fishing with Tom.

40:03.435 --> 40:04.834
He doesn't know how
to make a bomb.

40:04.836 --> 40:07.203
<i> He can't even</i>
<i> make bait in the cold.</i>

40:07.205 --> 40:09.439
All right, Wade, listen to me.
This is really important.

40:09.441 --> 40:11.141
Don't tell them
that we talked, okay?

40:14.513 --> 40:16.846
You know, I think
they already know.

40:18.784 --> 40:21.418
Mr. Wachowski.

40:21.753 --> 40:22.886
Tom.

40:22.888 --> 40:24.587
I want you to know
that the only other person

40:24.589 --> 40:27.791
who ever punched me in the face
was the school bully.

40:27.793 --> 40:30.493
He hit me in the cafeteria,
causing a blunt-force contusion

40:30.495 --> 40:33.062
to the soft tissue
surrounding my orbital bone.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.365
Humiliated me in front of
the entire school!

40:35.367 --> 40:37.100
And do you know
what I did in response?

40:37.102 --> 40:40.136
Uh, I'm assuming
that you reported him
to the principal's office

40:40.138 --> 40:42.138
'cause that kind of behavior
is really unacceptable.

40:42.140 --> 40:45.608
No. I examined
the inefficiency of a world
where brawn trumped brain

40:45.610 --> 40:48.645
and I used technology
to resolve that inefficiency.

40:48.647 --> 40:51.781
The boy ate his meals
through a straw for a year.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.850
And I have never
lost a fight again.

40:54.186 --> 40:55.251
Until today.

40:55.253 --> 40:56.920
Hey, hooray for me then, huh?

40:56.922 --> 40:59.789
No, because you're
about to become
the bully with the straw!

40:59.791 --> 41:02.592
I'm coming for you,
Mr. Wachowski.

41:02.594 --> 41:04.127
And when I catch you, I'll--

41:04.529 --> 41:06.529
hello.

41:06.531 --> 41:07.864
Hello?

41:08.333 --> 41:09.399
Hello, hello, hello?

41:09.401 --> 41:11.000
I think he actually hung up,

41:11.002 --> 41:12.669
because I notice
that the light isn't on.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.137
Thank you, officer brainfart.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.506
If you give me a second,
I can get an outside line.

41:16.508 --> 41:18.741
No. Don't be bothered.

41:18.743 --> 41:21.711
You just sit there and be "u"...

41:22.380 --> 41:23.980
...'seless.

41:30.755 --> 41:33.723
No one's gonna
erase my memory here?

41:34.593 --> 41:36.860
I will tell people about this!

41:39.264 --> 41:43.132
Okay, not exactly
the healthiest meal, but...

41:44.069 --> 41:45.268
Sonic?

41:49.241 --> 41:50.773
Oh, no.

41:51.243 --> 41:53.042
No, no, no, no, no!

41:57.482 --> 41:59.482
Whoo!
Yeah!

42:07.759 --> 42:09.192
Howdy, pardner!

42:09.194 --> 42:10.760
I'm not your partner.
Come on. We're leaving.

42:10.762 --> 42:12.495
But there's a zz top cover band.

42:12.497 --> 42:14.230
You gotta see their beards.

42:14.232 --> 42:16.065
You're gonna have to
catch 'em some other time.
Let's go. Get up!

42:16.067 --> 42:19.302
If we stay, I won't say another
word for the rest of the trip,

42:19.304 --> 42:21.037
starting... now.

42:22.173 --> 42:24.574
Welcome to the piston pit.
What can I get you fellas?

42:24.576 --> 42:26.876
I want nachos and buffalo wings,
oh, and guac.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.445
Funny word, isn't it?
Guac, guac! Guac.

42:29.447 --> 42:30.980
Hey, no kids
allowed in here.

42:30.982 --> 42:32.582
What's he got on,
some kind of mask?

42:32.584 --> 42:36.085
Oh, he's actually
43 years old and, um,

42:36.087 --> 42:38.154
suffers from
a very rare skin disease

42:38.156 --> 42:42.659
that stunts his growth
and makes him look, uh,
like that.

42:42.661 --> 42:43.960
The face,
I was born with.

42:43.962 --> 42:46.462
The confidence,
I picked up along the way.

42:46.464 --> 42:49.532
Make his a mello yello, please.
Okay.

42:50.435 --> 42:53.403
You owe me one.
I never sat
on a barstool before.

42:53.405 --> 42:54.837
So squishy!

42:54.839 --> 42:56.806
Oh, look at this.
It spins.

42:57.375 --> 42:58.575
Yes.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

42:58.577 --> 43:00.510
That's nice.
I feel sick.

43:00.512 --> 43:01.878
Are you having fun?

43:01.880 --> 43:03.546
Gonna check this off
the ol' bucket list, huh?

43:03.548 --> 43:05.615
Big night for you.
What's a bucket list?

43:05.617 --> 43:08.351
A bucket list is, uh...

43:08.353 --> 43:11.087
It's a list of things
you want to do in your life

43:11.089 --> 43:13.656
before you, well,
kick the bucket.

43:13.658 --> 43:15.425
I've never
kicked a bucket, either!

43:15.427 --> 43:17.293
Oh, I gotta make my list.

43:19.798 --> 43:21.431
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

43:21.433 --> 43:23.833
Oh, Sonic!

43:24.402 --> 43:25.902
Uh-huh.

43:30.609 --> 43:31.908
What? What's the matter?

43:31.910 --> 43:34.243
There's so much stuff
I've never done.

43:34.245 --> 43:36.913
And now that I'm
leaving earth forever,

43:36.915 --> 43:38.381
I guess I missed my chance.

43:44.322 --> 43:46.155
Well, I guess
this is the kind of place

43:46.157 --> 43:49.292
you could get a lot of living
done in a short period of time.

43:49.861 --> 43:51.127
I suppose we can spare an hour.

43:51.129 --> 43:53.830
What? You're gonna
bucket-list with me?

43:53.832 --> 43:56.766
Sure, why not?
You won't regret this.

43:56.768 --> 43:58.234
Oh, I'm pretty sure I will.

44:22.293 --> 44:24.327
New high score!

44:26.598 --> 44:28.364
Yippee-ki-yay!

44:28.733 --> 44:30.033
Ah-ha!

44:30.035 --> 44:32.068
Wait a second,
is this bull missing a head

44:32.070 --> 44:34.037
or does it have two butts?

44:35.874 --> 44:38.274
This is easy.

44:38.276 --> 44:41.177
Okay.
Ha-ha! Yeehaw!

44:43.882 --> 44:45.448
I'm a cowboy, baby!

44:48.586 --> 44:50.386
I'm okay.

44:52.791 --> 44:55.124
Whoo!

44:55.860 --> 44:57.694
Whoo! Yeah!

44:57.696 --> 44:59.829
Ha-ha-ha!

44:59.831 --> 45:01.130
Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.

45:01.132 --> 45:02.865
Nice work, Romeo.

45:02.867 --> 45:04.734
Glad you're having a good time.

45:04.736 --> 45:06.235
I am having a good time!

45:06.237 --> 45:09.338
I'm having the best time.
I mean, what could go wrong?

45:11.309 --> 45:12.775
Uh...

45:13.511 --> 45:14.877
Can we help you?

45:14.879 --> 45:16.646
We don't like
your kind around here.

45:16.648 --> 45:18.915
Our kind?
What kind is that?

45:20.719 --> 45:22.085
Hipsters.

45:22.087 --> 45:24.120
How dare you.
Oh, hey. You know what?

45:24.122 --> 45:25.588
We were leaving anyway.
Weren't we?

45:25.590 --> 45:28.124
There's not a problem here.
No, no, no, it's okay.

45:28.126 --> 45:29.459
No, no, no,
we're leaving.

45:29.461 --> 45:31.861
I know exactly
how to handle this situation.

45:31.863 --> 45:34.430
Pop quiz, hotshot.

45:34.432 --> 45:36.966
You just picked a fight with
a poorly disguised hedgehog

45:36.968 --> 45:39.135
who's seen way too many
action movies.

45:39.137 --> 45:41.738
What do you do? What do you do?

45:43.141 --> 45:46.175
Huh. Am I crazy?
It's supposed to break, right?

45:46.177 --> 45:49.178
Dink! Dink-dink!
Break, please. Break, please.

45:49.180 --> 45:50.713
Break this bottle, please.

45:50.715 --> 45:52.148
Please, please, please.
Uh, Sonic?

45:53.017 --> 45:54.584
Uh-oh!

46:02.627 --> 46:05.128
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Nice going!

46:05.130 --> 46:07.163
Thanks! It's awesome right?

46:07.165 --> 46:08.731
All right, who's next?
Who wants some?

46:08.733 --> 46:10.533
Who do I get to beat up?

46:11.302 --> 46:13.269
Hey! Has anybody
seen my waitress?

46:13.271 --> 46:15.571
Still waiting on
those buffalo wings.

46:15.573 --> 46:18.241
Why, you!

46:21.346 --> 46:23.279
Ha-ha-ha!

46:24.682 --> 46:26.783
Uh-oh!

46:29.354 --> 46:30.419
Really?

48:02.180 --> 48:04.247
<i> Olé!</i>

48:19.664 --> 48:22.431
So, should we get out of here?
Yeah, time to go.

48:23.001 --> 48:25.902
That was amazing!

48:25.904 --> 48:27.603
Wait a second.
Did we even pay our tab?

48:27.605 --> 48:29.071
It doesn't matter!

48:29.073 --> 48:31.274
Watch this, watch this.
I always wanted to do this.

48:34.712 --> 48:37.480
Get 'em!
See ya, suckers!

48:37.482 --> 48:41.117
I can't say for sure,
but I think they liked me.

48:42.086 --> 48:44.053
Come on!
Don't let 'em get away!

48:45.590 --> 48:47.723
Oh, yes!
Yeah!

48:47.725 --> 48:49.058
Yes!
Ouch!

48:49.060 --> 48:50.259
He got you pretty good.

48:50.261 --> 48:51.594
I'm all right.
I've been hit harder.

48:51.596 --> 48:53.729
Did you see how much
toilet paper I used?

48:53.731 --> 48:57.166
The next person that goes
into that bathroom
will have nothing to wipe with!

48:57.969 --> 49:00.202
The floors were sticky.
The crowd was rough.

49:00.204 --> 49:01.737
And the odds
were against us.

49:01.739 --> 49:05.174
But there was no stopping
donut lord and the blue blur.

49:05.176 --> 49:07.443
Scratch another one
off my list.

49:08.746 --> 49:11.280
You are a weird little dude.

49:19.223 --> 49:20.289
Mmm.

49:20.291 --> 49:21.324
Mmm.

49:21.326 --> 49:22.525
Mmm.

49:22.527 --> 49:23.459
Mmm.

49:23.461 --> 49:24.260
Okay.

49:24.262 --> 49:25.962
So what are we gonna do now?

49:27.398 --> 49:30.566
I'm gonna pass out watching TV.
I think you should too.

49:30.568 --> 49:32.268
But this is my
last night on earth.

49:32.270 --> 49:33.936
I want to soak up
every last second.

49:33.938 --> 49:36.205
All right, well, anything you
can find to do in this room,

49:36.207 --> 49:37.506
you knock yourself out.

49:44.816 --> 49:46.315
Good times.

49:47.986 --> 49:50.453
Oh, come on.

49:50.455 --> 49:52.388
That's awful.
What did you eat?

49:52.390 --> 49:54.757
I think it's called a chili dog?

49:54.759 --> 49:57.660
You might want to check
your fur on that one, buddy.

49:58.696 --> 50:01.564
Hey. So, what's this next planet
you're supposed to go to like?

50:01.566 --> 50:04.100
It's no earth,
I can tell you that.

50:04.102 --> 50:06.135
There's no people,
just breathable air

50:06.137 --> 50:08.204
and giant mushrooms and stuff.

50:08.706 --> 50:10.473
Well, look at it this way.

50:10.475 --> 50:13.476
At least you won't be
the only "fun-guy."

50:13.478 --> 50:15.678
No. Don't ever do that again.

50:16.948 --> 50:18.714
I liked it.

50:20.318 --> 50:22.651
I'm really gonna
miss this place.

50:22.653 --> 50:24.820
I know I have to
leave earth to be safe,

50:24.822 --> 50:26.722
but what if
longclaw was wrong?

50:27.525 --> 50:30.026
Maybe I could have a life here.

50:34.098 --> 50:37.099
All right.
We should get some sleep.

50:38.036 --> 50:39.568
You sleep.
Don't worry about me.

50:39.570 --> 50:43.139
I'm gonna stay up all night
enjoying earth while I can.

50:43.574 --> 50:45.174
Sure, kid.

50:45.176 --> 50:47.610
As long as we're
on the road by 8:00.

50:53.684 --> 50:56.552
I ate a chili dog.
That's why my farts smell.

51:11.002 --> 51:15.871
<i>Thomas wachowski,</i>
<i>accused of committing</i>
<i>an act of domestic terrorism.</i>

51:15.873 --> 51:18.808
<i> Wachowski is considered</i>
<i> armed and dangerous.</i>

51:18.810 --> 51:20.776
<i>Any information</i>
<i>regarding his whereabouts</i>

51:20.778 --> 51:24.447
<i>should be reported to</i>
<i>local authorities immediately.</i>

51:30.021 --> 51:31.654
Did he say where he was going?

51:35.059 --> 51:37.760
Maybe. Maybe not.

51:38.429 --> 51:40.162
Like I'd ever tell you.

51:41.199 --> 51:43.199
Stand down, agent stone.

51:43.201 --> 51:47.169
This well-meaning citizen
obviously doesn't understand
the urgency of the matter.

51:49.807 --> 51:51.140
Really?

51:53.945 --> 51:56.245
Now that's
what I call good cop, bad cop.

51:57.815 --> 51:59.381
Hoy!

51:59.383 --> 52:01.217
Left yourself open.

52:03.688 --> 52:05.521
Judging by the quickest route
to San Francisco,

52:05.523 --> 52:07.423
the approximate
speed of their vehicle,

52:07.425 --> 52:08.924
and local weather conditions...

52:10.361 --> 52:12.194
They should be...

52:12.763 --> 52:14.697
Right about...

52:15.800 --> 52:17.133
Here.

52:17.135 --> 52:19.768
That's brilliant, sir.
Thanks...

52:19.770 --> 52:21.770
For nothing.

52:23.474 --> 52:26.208
So, what's on your bucket list?
Who, me?

52:26.210 --> 52:27.943
Yeah. Everyone has
a bucket list, right?

52:27.945 --> 52:29.278
Sure, but...

52:29.280 --> 52:31.347
I mean, you're the one
leaving earth, and...

52:31.349 --> 52:33.082
I'm not planning
on dying anytime soon.

52:33.084 --> 52:34.517
Don't be so sure.

52:34.519 --> 52:36.418
Your best friend
is a magnet for danger.

52:36.420 --> 52:38.687
Are you anointing yourself
as the bestie?

52:38.689 --> 52:39.955
Mm-hmm.

52:39.957 --> 52:42.324
A little presumptuous, but...
I mean... what, no...

52:42.326 --> 52:44.760
I like you, of course, but,

52:44.762 --> 52:46.695
you know,
we're not best friends.

52:46.697 --> 52:48.664
You tucked me in last night.

52:48.666 --> 52:50.432
Fine, fine, fine.
Best animal friend.

52:50.434 --> 52:52.134
That would be my dog, ozzy.
Okay...

52:52.136 --> 52:55.938
Let's drop
this increasingly humiliating
topic of conversation.

52:55.940 --> 52:57.806
Bucket list.
Give it to me!

52:58.309 --> 53:00.509
Okay, there is one thing.

53:01.179 --> 53:03.212
In green hills,
I've always felt,

53:03.214 --> 53:06.649
I don't know,
more like a babysitter
than a real cop, you know?

53:06.651 --> 53:09.652
So I want a chance
to prove myself,
under real pressure.

53:09.654 --> 53:12.922
I'm gonna move to San Francisco,
become a street cop.

53:12.924 --> 53:15.824
And, I don't know,
see if I have what it takes.

53:16.827 --> 53:17.927
What?

53:19.130 --> 53:20.596
Why--
why is your face doing that?

53:20.598 --> 53:22.865
You're leaving green hills?

53:23.267 --> 53:24.600
Okay.

53:24.602 --> 53:27.102
B-B-But why?
Why would you leave green hills?

53:27.104 --> 53:29.905
This may be hard
for you to understand,
but green hills is a small town.

53:29.907 --> 53:31.340
It's a very small town.

53:31.342 --> 53:34.210
Uh, it's not small.
There are hundreds of people.

53:34.212 --> 53:35.611
That's a small town, dude!

53:35.613 --> 53:38.547
It's a perfect town,
and the people need you.

53:38.549 --> 53:39.882
Please.
I clean out their gutters.

53:39.884 --> 53:42.117
I jump-start their cars
in the winter.

53:42.119 --> 53:43.452
They could call anybody
to do that.

53:43.454 --> 53:46.188
Sure, they can call anybody,
but they don't.

53:46.190 --> 53:47.790
They call you.

54:03.107 --> 54:07.409
Eeny, meeny, miny...

54:08.045 --> 54:09.178
Mayhem.

54:20.658 --> 54:22.324
You're not making any sense.
Would you calm down?

54:22.326 --> 54:25.261
You come from a great town
with great people
and by my count,

54:25.263 --> 54:27.496
zero bad guys
trying to kill you!

54:29.567 --> 54:32.268
Besides, what could possibly
be more important

54:32.270 --> 54:34.370
than protecting
the people you care about?

54:40.578 --> 54:42.845
Look, I get your poi--
whoa!

54:44.081 --> 54:45.581
Yeah!

54:52.523 --> 54:54.590
You know what?
I was wrong about you.

54:54.592 --> 54:56.458
You're not
the donut lord at all.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.093
You're more like the jerk lord.

54:58.095 --> 55:00.896
Have you noticed the harpoon
stuck in our dash?

55:05.536 --> 55:07.703
Sonic!

55:07.705 --> 55:09.538
I was forced from my home.

55:09.540 --> 55:11.707
Your home is perfect,
and you're leaving it.

55:11.709 --> 55:13.542
Why would you do that?

55:13.544 --> 55:16.278
Your body!
Oh, no, not again!

55:16.280 --> 55:17.379
Hey! Hold on!

55:17.381 --> 55:19.248
Why?
Because I'm gonna do this.

55:38.069 --> 55:39.601
Sonic!

55:40.371 --> 55:41.904
Sonic!

55:45.976 --> 55:48.577
Guess I had a bonus life.

55:49.180 --> 55:52.314
Oh, yeah, baby!

55:52.316 --> 55:55.584
Sonic, one. Big tank, zero.
I'm sorry.

55:55.586 --> 55:58.087
Did we get that on camera?
How are you not dead?

55:58.089 --> 55:59.455
I have no idea.

55:59.457 --> 56:02.157
Do you see me dancing?
Yes, I saw you dance.

56:02.159 --> 56:03.892
Is that all you got?

56:03.894 --> 56:05.828
No, but thank you for asking.

56:08.766 --> 56:12.134
Uh-oh.
Sonic! Get back in the truck!

56:12.136 --> 56:14.136
You go. I'll catch up.

56:18.142 --> 56:19.508
Ha!

56:24.815 --> 56:27.549
I think that tank
just had a baby.

56:39.897 --> 56:41.029
Incoming!

56:43.167 --> 56:46.001
It's my turn!
You just had one. It's mine!

56:46.003 --> 56:48.337
Hey, stop fighting
or I'm taking that thing away!

56:48.339 --> 56:49.438
Yeah, right, dad.

57:01.285 --> 57:02.618
Where are you going?

57:02.620 --> 57:05.020
Just drive the car.
I'll take care of this.

57:05.022 --> 57:07.189
And if I don't make it,
just ditch me.

57:07.191 --> 57:08.690
You seem good at that.

57:18.169 --> 57:20.469
<i>Hey, everyone!</i>
<i>Welcome back to my livestream.</i>

57:20.471 --> 57:21.570
<i>Today we're destroying robots.</i>

57:21.572 --> 57:23.605
Step one.

57:27.478 --> 57:29.812
Yes, we did it!

57:33.951 --> 57:36.718
We did not do it.
Who <i> is </i> this guy?

57:36.720 --> 57:39.421
Ever wonder where
your tax dollars are going?

57:39.423 --> 57:40.589
My turn.

57:40.591 --> 57:42.224
Here, just keep us
going straight.

57:42.226 --> 57:43.525
I put it in cruise control.

57:43.527 --> 57:45.394
I feel just like vin diesel.

57:45.396 --> 57:47.563
"It's all about family, Tom."

57:53.504 --> 57:55.304
Quick suggestion.

57:55.306 --> 57:58.707
Roll up into a ball
and smash him with your body.

57:59.610 --> 58:01.810
Whoa! Where'd you
learn how to drive?

58:01.812 --> 58:04.646
Here. In this truck.
It's happening as we speak.

58:07.685 --> 58:09.651
I can't reach it.
Bring him in closer.

58:09.653 --> 58:11.119
What?
Bring it in closer!

58:11.121 --> 58:13.522
Hit the brakes.
Oh, you mean this one?

58:13.524 --> 58:15.390
The other brakes!

58:24.568 --> 58:26.935
Ha-ha! Whoo!

58:27.872 --> 58:29.638
Oh!

58:29.640 --> 58:33.175
Give me a big, fat break!

58:38.182 --> 58:41.250
Aw, this one is cute.
Let's keep him.

58:42.453 --> 58:43.752
Aah!

58:44.321 --> 58:45.854
Oh, come on!

58:45.856 --> 58:48.590
How could something
so adorable be so terrible?

58:51.462 --> 58:53.095
You've got car insurance, right?

58:59.670 --> 59:00.969
Buzz off.

59:00.971 --> 59:02.738
That doesn't sound good.

59:02.740 --> 59:05.073
No, beeping is bad.
Get rid of it!
I'm trying.

59:05.075 --> 59:06.942
Throw it out the win--
throw it anywhere!

59:06.944 --> 59:09.678
I can't get it off.
All right, I'm pulling over.

59:17.388 --> 59:19.288
Did I get it?
Nope.

59:20.424 --> 59:22.090
Here. Hold still.

59:22.993 --> 59:24.993
It's going,
it's going...

59:24.995 --> 59:28.597
It's still here.

59:29.700 --> 59:31.300
Get off me.

59:31.302 --> 59:33.068
Ha-ha! Nailed it!

59:42.379 --> 59:43.946
Sonic!

59:51.188 --> 59:52.621
No, no, no, no, no.

59:59.063 --> 1:00:03.298
Hey. Come on. You're all right.
Wake up. Wake up.

1:00:10.407 --> 1:00:12.240
Did we get 'em?

1:00:12.242 --> 1:00:14.176
Oh. No, there they are.

1:00:14.178 --> 1:00:17.079
They are real survivors,
those two.

1:00:21.919 --> 1:00:23.685
Can we have a moment?

1:00:26.357 --> 1:00:27.956
Pin yourself
to the wall.

1:00:29.093 --> 1:00:31.526
You know, I won't miss you
when you're gone.

1:00:31.528 --> 1:00:33.695
Human beings are
unreliable and stupid,

1:00:33.697 --> 1:00:35.297
and I care very little
about them.

1:00:35.299 --> 1:00:38.333
But my machines are diligent,
relentless.

1:00:38.335 --> 1:00:40.302
They're everything to me!

1:00:42.172 --> 1:00:43.639
Huh?

1:01:03.394 --> 1:01:04.726
Mmm?

1:01:17.908 --> 1:01:19.374
Come on, buddy.

1:01:19.376 --> 1:01:22.177
You're gonna be all right.
You'll be all right.

1:01:27.484 --> 1:01:28.717
Is maddie here?
No, no.

1:01:28.719 --> 1:01:30.052
Not today. Goodbye.
It's an emergency!

1:01:30.054 --> 1:01:32.087
Bye-bye.
Rachel, stop! Maddie!

1:01:32.089 --> 1:01:33.689
Don't do this.
This is important.

1:01:33.691 --> 1:01:35.857
Oh, my god!
Rachel, let him in.
I am calling the police.

1:01:35.859 --> 1:01:38.126
No, I am calling the FBI.
I am calling the CIA.

1:01:38.128 --> 1:01:40.028
Stop. Don't do that.
I am calling your mother.

1:01:40.030 --> 1:01:41.997
Okay, got it.
Maddie, can we talk?

1:01:41.999 --> 1:01:44.933
Tom, what's going on?
You're all over the news.
I've been trying to call you.

1:01:44.935 --> 1:01:46.768
I had to ditch my phone
so they couldn't track me.

1:01:46.770 --> 1:01:48.370
Ditch his phone?
Track you?

1:01:48.372 --> 1:01:50.772
Uncle Tommy!
Jojo! Hey!

1:01:50.774 --> 1:01:53.442
Now your niece is
an accessory to treason.

1:01:53.444 --> 1:01:54.910
No, she's not.
Calm down.

1:01:54.912 --> 1:01:56.978
Calm down?
I will not calm down!

1:01:56.980 --> 1:01:58.747
Enough.
Yes, calm down. Stop talking.

1:01:58.749 --> 1:02:00.949
No. Ozzy, please.
Good to see you too.

1:02:00.951 --> 1:02:03.919
Oh, little lord baby Jesus.

1:02:03.921 --> 1:02:05.153
What is that, Tom?

1:02:05.155 --> 1:02:06.722
Is that plutonium?
Is it e-mails?

1:02:06.724 --> 1:02:08.356
Yes, it's plutonium.

1:02:08.358 --> 1:02:10.425
Can we please go in
the other room and talk--

1:02:10.427 --> 1:02:11.660
stop it, ozzy. Quit it!

1:02:11.662 --> 1:02:13.128
This is why I told you
he was no good.

1:02:13.130 --> 1:02:15.697
I'm not engaging.
No, ozzy, quit it.

1:02:17.668 --> 1:02:20.102
Ozzy, no! Ozzy, no!

1:02:20.971 --> 1:02:23.472
Oh, catch me, jojo.

1:02:23.474 --> 1:02:25.941
Oh, thank god.

1:02:25.943 --> 1:02:29.411
Can I get a glass of water?

1:04:10.214 --> 1:04:11.880
I just thought
you might like a latte

1:04:11.882 --> 1:04:13.515
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

1:04:14.151 --> 1:04:16.151
Who do I look like,
an imbecile?

1:04:16.153 --> 1:04:19.588
Of course I want a latte.
I love the way you make them!

1:04:26.396 --> 1:04:28.730
Ready the prototype.

1:04:28.732 --> 1:04:30.398
With this kind of power,

1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:34.636
my machines can finally reach
their full potential.

1:04:40.944 --> 1:04:42.978
He's gonna be okay, jojo.

1:04:43.914 --> 1:04:46.615
Oh, thank god.
He's gonna be okay, right?

1:04:46.617 --> 1:04:49.284
I'm a vet, Tom.
I don't even know
what I'm looking at here.

1:04:49.286 --> 1:04:51.653
He's a hedgehog.
Or so he says.

1:04:51.655 --> 1:04:53.488
It talks?
Almost constantly.

1:04:53.991 --> 1:04:56.224
Okay.

1:04:56.660 --> 1:04:57.959
Holy...
What?

1:04:57.961 --> 1:04:59.394
His pulse is super-fast.

1:04:59.396 --> 1:05:01.329
That actually
might be normal for him.

1:05:01.331 --> 1:05:03.098
I don't know.
You gotta help him, maddie.

1:05:03.100 --> 1:05:04.966
I don't know his physiology.

1:05:04.968 --> 1:05:07.669
He doesn't seem
to have any broken bones.

1:05:07.671 --> 1:05:10.505
He's just really banged up.

1:05:11.275 --> 1:05:14.542
Oh, look at
his poor little feet.

1:05:17.481 --> 1:05:20.415
Hang in there, buddy.
You're gonna be all right.

1:05:23.220 --> 1:05:26.021
Jojo?
Untie your mother. Jojo!

1:05:26.023 --> 1:05:28.356
Untie mommy.

1:05:28.358 --> 1:05:30.558
Sweetie. Jojo!

1:05:33.497 --> 1:05:35.063
I have to go to the bathroom.

1:05:35.065 --> 1:05:37.232
He's gonna be okay, right?
Uh--

1:05:37.234 --> 1:05:39.868
he'll snap out of this.
He'll wake up soon?

1:05:39.870 --> 1:05:41.169
Oh, smelling salts!

1:05:41.171 --> 1:05:42.437
Don't you have, like,
vet smelling salts,

1:05:42.439 --> 1:05:44.406
like for cats or parakeets
or something?

1:05:44.408 --> 1:05:47.375
No. They don't make
cat smelling salts.

1:05:47.377 --> 1:05:50.312
They should.
I have human smelling salts

1:05:50.314 --> 1:05:52.447
in my human first aid kit.

1:05:53.684 --> 1:05:55.150
Okay.

1:05:56.853 --> 1:05:58.486
Here we go.
Come on, buddy.

1:05:58.488 --> 1:05:59.721
Gotta go fast!

1:06:02.392 --> 1:06:04.359
Whoa.
Where am I? What year is it?

1:06:04.361 --> 1:06:05.827
Is the rock president?

1:06:05.829 --> 1:06:07.162
Whoa, buddy, you're okay.
Calm down.

1:06:07.164 --> 1:06:08.596
Oh, hi, pretzel lady!

1:06:08.598 --> 1:06:10.265
Hi.

1:06:10.767 --> 1:06:12.167
Tom?
Yeah.

1:06:12.169 --> 1:06:13.601
Can I talk to you, please?

1:06:16.573 --> 1:06:18.974
Space hedgehog, stay there.
Try to rest.

1:06:18.976 --> 1:06:20.508
You got it.
I am great at resting.

1:06:20.510 --> 1:06:22.744
I rest faster than anybody.

1:06:22.746 --> 1:06:23.979
Still talking.

1:06:23.981 --> 1:06:25.513
Uh, first of all,
can we take a moment

1:06:25.515 --> 1:06:27.349
to acknowledge how
under control I've been?

1:06:27.351 --> 1:06:29.184
Amazing.
Didn't freak out.

1:06:29.186 --> 1:06:31.720
No.
Totally calm.

1:06:31.722 --> 1:06:33.955
Thank you.
Ahh.

1:06:33.957 --> 1:06:36.124
Second of all...

1:06:36.126 --> 1:06:38.860
What the heck is going on?
Is that thing an alien?

1:06:38.862 --> 1:06:42.497
Okay, so, remember
how crazy Carl is
always going on

1:06:42.499 --> 1:06:44.332
about the blue devil?
The blue devil!

1:06:44.334 --> 1:06:46.501
That's him? He's real?
Yeah.

1:06:46.503 --> 1:06:48.737
What is he doing here?
What are you doing here?

1:06:48.739 --> 1:06:51.306
I... kinda sorta...

1:06:51.308 --> 1:06:53.408
Shot our little blue friend
with your tranq gun.

1:06:53.410 --> 1:06:55.643
No, you did not.
I didn't mean to.

1:06:55.645 --> 1:06:57.679
This is kinda hard
for me to explain.

1:06:57.681 --> 1:06:59.547
And it's gonna sound
a little bit crazy.

1:06:59.549 --> 1:07:01.950
He has to get to
the Transamerica building,

1:07:01.952 --> 1:07:03.518
and I promised
I'd take him.

1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:05.587
Uh-uh! Aliens?

1:07:05.589 --> 1:07:08.223
Maddie, your husband's
lost his mind.

1:07:08.225 --> 1:07:10.291
Use this as an opportunity
to leave him.

1:07:10.293 --> 1:07:12.360
No one would judge you.

1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.100
So you won't
hurt your feet anymore.

1:07:19.736 --> 1:07:21.569
Really?
Uh-huh.

1:07:22.272 --> 1:07:24.439
No one's ever
given me a gift before.

1:07:25.142 --> 1:07:27.308
I gotta check that
off my bucket list.

1:07:36.953 --> 1:07:39.487
All right! Looking good!

1:07:41.892 --> 1:07:43.458
Okay.

1:07:43.460 --> 1:07:45.860
You said you wanted to help
people in real trouble, right?

1:07:46.530 --> 1:07:48.196
Well, that's what you're doing.

1:07:48.198 --> 1:07:51.766
Blue alien hedgehogs
still count as people.
Right?

1:07:51.768 --> 1:07:53.068
I think so too.
Yeah.

1:07:53.070 --> 1:07:54.402
I think.
Okay.

1:07:54.404 --> 1:07:56.504
I love you.
Did I tell you that
already?

1:07:56.506 --> 1:07:58.640
I don't deserve you.
You know that?

1:07:58.642 --> 1:08:00.175
I know that.

1:08:02.546 --> 1:08:05.346
So, you're supposed to be
Tom's best friend

1:08:05.348 --> 1:08:06.981
that he won't shut up about.

1:08:08.785 --> 1:08:10.452
Well, I don't see the appeal.

1:08:11.588 --> 1:08:13.755
Stop!

1:08:13.757 --> 1:08:16.224
That is very gross.

1:08:17.260 --> 1:08:18.760
Hey.
Hey.

1:08:18.762 --> 1:08:21.729
So, my truck still runs,
but it's pretty much totaled.

1:08:21.731 --> 1:08:23.998
You think your sister would
mind if we borrowed her car?

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:25.767
You have got to be kidding me!

1:08:26.703 --> 1:08:28.203
She'll be fine.
Yeah, let's do that.

1:08:28.205 --> 1:08:29.704
Mm-hmm.

1:08:29.706 --> 1:08:32.006
This is my house!

1:08:32.008 --> 1:08:33.975
Coming through!

1:08:33.977 --> 1:08:37.245
Whoa, whoa! Now this is my turn,
and I go around you.

1:08:37.247 --> 1:08:39.214
Sorry! And...

1:08:39.216 --> 1:08:41.549
- Perfect park.
- What are you, crazy?

1:08:41.551 --> 1:08:42.851
Is there anything
you didn't hit?

1:08:42.853 --> 1:08:44.486
Why did we let the alien drive?

1:08:44.488 --> 1:08:47.755
Hey, I got us here.
And please, five stars.

1:08:49.192 --> 1:08:52.560
So, this is it?
That's it. That's your pyramid.

1:08:52.562 --> 1:08:54.896
Wow, look at that thing!

1:08:54.898 --> 1:08:56.297
What happens now?

1:08:56.933 --> 1:08:59.734
Oh. He's... gone.
Yep.

1:09:00.704 --> 1:09:03.505
No good.
You need a special key
to get to the roof.

1:09:04.674 --> 1:09:06.207
What now?

1:09:06.209 --> 1:09:09.344
Time for me to abuse
the power entrusted to me.

1:09:19.022 --> 1:09:21.356
We got a jumper on the roof.
Gotta get up there fast

1:09:21.358 --> 1:09:23.758
or we're gonna have
a human pancake on our hands.

1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:25.894
You came all the way
from Montana.

1:09:26.963 --> 1:09:28.763
Yeah. That's how serious it is.

1:09:33.570 --> 1:09:34.669
Okay.

1:09:36.273 --> 1:09:37.839
You just saved a life.

1:09:46.449 --> 1:09:49.417
How much longer?
I can't breathe in here.

1:09:51.254 --> 1:09:53.688
Hello?
Anybody there?

1:09:53.690 --> 1:09:56.090
Do you have your child
in that bag?

1:09:56.092 --> 1:09:57.425
No.

1:09:57.427 --> 1:09:59.961
I mean, yes, it's a child,
but it's not mine.

1:10:00.964 --> 1:10:02.030
It's not your child.

1:10:02.032 --> 1:10:04.499
Relax.
I'm a cop, okay?

1:10:04.501 --> 1:10:06.134
Plus, he likes it in there,
don't you, buddy?

1:10:06.136 --> 1:10:07.635
Why would I
like it in here?

1:10:07.637 --> 1:10:10.772
This is worse than the dog cage
you had me in earlier.

1:10:11.575 --> 1:10:14.475
Such a kidder.

1:10:14.477 --> 1:10:17.278
Okay.
No, I'm scared of the dark!

1:10:17.714 --> 1:10:19.280
Is anybody there?

1:10:30.727 --> 1:10:34.128
What were you
keeping in this bag?

1:10:34.130 --> 1:10:35.630
A jar of pickled farts?

1:10:35.632 --> 1:10:37.532
All right.
What are we looking for?

1:10:40.437 --> 1:10:42.237
This.

1:10:42.906 --> 1:10:44.672
Okay.
What happens now?

1:10:44.674 --> 1:10:46.608
Now all I have to do
is think of where I want

1:10:46.610 --> 1:10:48.977
the other end of the ring
to appear, and I throw it.

1:10:48.979 --> 1:10:51.079
So that's it?
We did it?

1:10:51.081 --> 1:10:52.947
Yeah. We did it!

1:10:52.949 --> 1:10:56.651
Hey. Sorry we didn't
get to do everything
on your bucket list, pal.

1:10:56.653 --> 1:10:59.487
It's okay.
I did the ones
I needed the most.

1:10:59.489 --> 1:11:03.057
You two are so cute.

1:11:03.059 --> 1:11:05.326
Oh, please. What?
We are not.

1:11:05.328 --> 1:11:06.961
No.
We're not cute.

1:11:06.963 --> 1:11:09.664
We are a couple of loose cannons
just living by our own rules.

1:11:09.666 --> 1:11:10.531
Exactly.

1:11:10.533 --> 1:11:12.000
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:11:12.002 --> 1:11:14.769
And our rules include
expressing heartfelt emotions.

1:11:14.771 --> 1:11:16.170
If you say so.

1:11:16.172 --> 1:11:18.806
Okay, then.
All right.

1:11:19.676 --> 1:11:21.676
- Um, you gotta go, right?
- Yeah, I gotta go.

1:11:21.678 --> 1:11:23.144
I gotta go.
We gotta go too.

1:11:23.146 --> 1:11:24.912
See-- all right, bye-bye.

1:11:29.386 --> 1:11:31.519
Just one more thing.

1:11:39.129 --> 1:11:41.496
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

1:11:43.833 --> 1:11:46.968
I know it's a tough decision
for you to leave green hills.

1:11:46.970 --> 1:11:49.804
Walking away from
something you care about

1:11:50.373 --> 1:11:51.706
has to be painful.

1:11:51.708 --> 1:11:53.908
You're not sure
you really want to go, huh?

1:11:54.878 --> 1:11:58.379
I don't want to go,
but I can't stay.

1:11:58.381 --> 1:12:01.082
As long as I'm here,
I put everyone in danger.

1:12:01.484 --> 1:12:03.785
I can't do that.

1:12:03.787 --> 1:12:08.122
I just want you to know that
these last two days have been

1:12:08.124 --> 1:12:10.858
the best two days of my life.

1:12:13.763 --> 1:12:15.330
You know, I never
thought I'd say this,

1:12:15.332 --> 1:12:18.166
but I'm actually
gonna miss you,
you little blue devil.

1:12:18.168 --> 1:12:20.034
I'll miss you too,
donut lord.

1:12:20.970 --> 1:12:22.070
Thank you.

1:12:22.706 --> 1:12:23.805
For what?

1:12:24.507 --> 1:12:26.374
For saving my life.

1:12:43.927 --> 1:12:47.061
Okay. Did someone leave
their "find my phone" on?

1:13:13.590 --> 1:13:16.591
Welcome to San Francisco,
Mr. Wachowski.

1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:19.060
Are you enjoying
the clam chowder?

1:13:19.062 --> 1:13:21.462
It's the government wack job
who keeps trying to kill us.

1:13:21.464 --> 1:13:22.897
Unsuccessfully!

1:13:22.899 --> 1:13:24.866
Nice of you to swing by
on your way to comic-con.

1:13:24.868 --> 1:13:27.001
Yeah,
what are you wearing?

1:13:28.371 --> 1:13:29.971
It's a flight suit,

1:13:29.973 --> 1:13:32.707
designed to modulate
my body temperature
and reduce drag.

1:13:32.709 --> 1:13:34.442
Yeah, and yet
you still are one.

1:13:34.444 --> 1:13:36.344
Ooh-hoo! Good one.

1:13:36.346 --> 1:13:38.179
You are catching fire,
Thomas.

1:13:38.181 --> 1:13:41.315
Oh, and speaking of heat,
I see you've taken a lover.

1:13:41.317 --> 1:13:42.683
Does she have a name

1:13:42.685 --> 1:13:45.119
or should we just call her
"collateral damage"?

1:13:45.121 --> 1:13:46.687
Hey, watch your mouth.

1:13:46.689 --> 1:13:48.656
Unless you want a little more
of what I gave you earlier?

1:13:48.658 --> 1:13:50.191
I punched him
in the face.

1:13:50.193 --> 1:13:52.360
Oh! He punched him
right in the face!
It was awesome!

1:13:52.362 --> 1:13:55.563
The time for talking is over!
It's time to push buttons.

1:13:55.565 --> 1:13:58.766
Your flying eggs are pretty
impressive, Mr. Eggman,

1:13:58.768 --> 1:14:01.269
but let's face it,
you'll never catch me.

1:14:01.271 --> 1:14:03.037
Confidence!

1:14:03.039 --> 1:14:05.573
A fool's substitute
for intelligence.

1:14:13.183 --> 1:14:15.082
That's not good.
Uh...

1:14:15.084 --> 1:14:17.118
Sonic, I know you got
the super-speed
and everything,

1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:20.354
but maddie and I...
Totally defenseless?
Probably gonna get blown up?

1:14:20.356 --> 1:14:22.390
Pretty much, yeah.

1:14:22.392 --> 1:14:25.159
Don't worry.
I know exactly what to do.

1:14:32.502 --> 1:14:34.469
I was not expecting that.

1:14:34.471 --> 1:14:37.738
But I was expecting
not to expect something,
so it doesn't count.

1:15:20.049 --> 1:15:22.083
Pew, pew-pew-pew,
pew-pew-pew-pew!

1:15:25.855 --> 1:15:29.023
Oh!

1:15:37.567 --> 1:15:39.100
Come on!

1:15:39.602 --> 1:15:41.369
Come on, come on, come on.

1:15:53.383 --> 1:15:55.983
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no, no!

1:16:07.697 --> 1:16:09.497
Oh! Hi, Tom.

1:16:09.499 --> 1:16:11.732
Glad you're here.
Could use some help.

1:16:11.734 --> 1:16:13.601
Old bessie's
about to give birth.

1:16:13.603 --> 1:16:15.937
Give me a minute.

1:16:16.372 --> 1:16:17.738
Aah.

1:16:18.708 --> 1:16:22.176
Can I give you one
genius piece of advice?

1:16:22.478 --> 1:16:24.045
Don't run.

1:16:24.047 --> 1:16:26.380
It'll only hurt more if you do.

1:16:26.382 --> 1:16:28.883
And it's bad for your joints.
They've proved it.

1:16:28.885 --> 1:16:31.419
All right, eggman.
You wanna get fast?

1:16:31.421 --> 1:16:32.620
Let's get fast.

1:16:35.758 --> 1:16:37.325
The hard way it is.

1:16:56.245 --> 1:16:58.312
That was an illegal left,
by the way.

1:17:00.883 --> 1:17:02.917
<i> So, here we are again.</i>

1:17:02.919 --> 1:17:04.619
<i> We've been through</i>
<i> so much together.</i>

1:17:04.621 --> 1:17:07.288
<i>Now you understand why there's</i>
<i>a psychotic robot doctor</i>

1:17:07.290 --> 1:17:09.757
<i> chasing a supersonic</i>
<i> blue hedgehog.</i>

1:17:09.759 --> 1:17:12.727
<i> Want to know how it ends?</i>
<i> Yeah, me too.</i>

1:17:30.213 --> 1:17:31.278
How is this possible?

1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:33.848
No one's ever
caught up to me before.

1:17:41.391 --> 1:17:43.324
Coming through!

1:17:43.326 --> 1:17:44.425
<i> Sacrebleu!</i>

1:17:45.228 --> 1:17:47.862
<i>Excusez-moi, monsieur!</i>

1:17:51.534 --> 1:17:54.035
Here we go.
Room to open it up.

1:18:02.945 --> 1:18:04.445
I can't lose him!

1:18:18.594 --> 1:18:21.062
If you can't beat 'em,
blind 'em.

1:18:24.467 --> 1:18:26.801
Lost visual contact.

1:18:31.340 --> 1:18:35.376
You're not allowed up there!
It's one of the seven wonders!

1:18:59.535 --> 1:19:01.268
Get out of here!

1:19:08.911 --> 1:19:12.413
You're an astonishing
little creature.

1:19:14.317 --> 1:19:16.584
It'll be fun to take you
back to the lab

1:19:16.586 --> 1:19:19.286
for a litany of invasive
exploratory procedures.

1:19:19.956 --> 1:19:21.989
Any last words?

1:19:22.658 --> 1:19:25.760
Guac. I like that word.

1:19:27.096 --> 1:19:29.330
I don't have to tell you how
many scientific breakthroughs

1:19:29.332 --> 1:19:31.899
have been made possible
by animal testing.

1:19:31.901 --> 1:19:33.234
You're being very selfish.

1:19:33.236 --> 1:19:34.435
Going my way?

1:19:34.437 --> 1:19:35.669
What the--

1:19:40.943 --> 1:19:43.177
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1:19:46.182 --> 1:19:47.848
I'm the donut lord,
you son of a--

1:19:52.889 --> 1:19:54.955
Autopilot, adjust.

1:19:55.458 --> 1:19:56.891
Why?

1:19:56.893 --> 1:20:00.161
Why would you throw
your life away for this thing?

1:20:00.163 --> 1:20:01.562
That's why I don't have friends.

1:20:01.564 --> 1:20:03.864
Next thing you know,
you're somebody's best man.

1:20:03.866 --> 1:20:05.332
They want to have
the wedding out of town.

1:20:05.334 --> 1:20:07.668
Like nobody has anything
better to do!

1:20:08.237 --> 1:20:10.337
Anyway, where were we?

1:20:10.339 --> 1:20:13.240
Oh, yes.
You were about to die.

1:20:15.178 --> 1:20:17.244
That's our sheriff
you're messing with.

1:20:18.714 --> 1:20:20.581
And our blue devil...

1:20:20.583 --> 1:20:24.018
Who as everyone can see
is a very real creature,

1:20:24.020 --> 1:20:26.854
and not at all invented by me.

1:20:29.091 --> 1:20:31.158
Oh, careful.
Just-- just put it away.

1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:32.426
Tom?

1:20:45.875 --> 1:20:47.675
I don't mean
to be indelicate here,

1:20:47.677 --> 1:20:51.512
but someone should get some ice,
keep the body fresh.

1:20:54.217 --> 1:20:56.717
He's just a silly little alien.

1:20:57.153 --> 1:20:58.853
He didn't belong here!

1:21:00.723 --> 1:21:03.023
That little alien

1:21:03.025 --> 1:21:06.527
knew more about being human
than you ever will.

1:21:06.996 --> 1:21:08.395
His name was Sonic.

1:21:09.398 --> 1:21:10.865
This was his home.

1:21:11.701 --> 1:21:13.267
And he was my friend.

1:21:38.394 --> 1:21:39.593
He's all yours.

1:21:41.097 --> 1:21:42.529
Everyone, get back!

1:21:46.035 --> 1:21:49.069
I think you have something
that belongs to me.

1:21:49.605 --> 1:21:50.905
Whoa.

1:21:59.782 --> 1:22:01.548
This is my power.

1:22:01.550 --> 1:22:04.285
And I'm not using it
to run away anymore.

1:22:04.287 --> 1:22:08.155
I'm using it
to protect my friends.

1:23:05.181 --> 1:23:07.281
Ooh! Now you've done it!

1:23:07.283 --> 1:23:08.782
Guess what, eggman?

1:23:08.784 --> 1:23:11.518
I'm not leaving earth. You are.

1:23:11.921 --> 1:23:13.454
Donut lord?

1:24:02.238 --> 1:24:04.772
I told you, you got this.
Hey, <i> we </i> got this.

1:24:17.453 --> 1:24:19.720
I think these belong to you.
Thank you very much.

1:24:21.057 --> 1:24:22.823
No more pushing people
off of buildings.

1:24:22.825 --> 1:24:24.525
You know
I can't promise that.

1:24:27.897 --> 1:24:30.764
You did pretty good, space hog.
Thanks, donut lord.

1:24:30.766 --> 1:24:33.934
You're gonna have to explain
this "donut lord" thing.

1:24:33.936 --> 1:24:36.870
Nope, sorry. That's for me
and the little guy. Right?

1:24:36.872 --> 1:24:40.407
We got our thing, you got
your thing with your... sister.
Oh, my god, my sister.

1:24:40.409 --> 1:24:45.245
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.

1:24:45.247 --> 1:24:47.247
Jojo, put on my fitbit...

1:24:48.017 --> 1:24:49.817
So I can at least
get some steps.

1:24:49.819 --> 1:24:51.385
We can never go back there.

1:24:52.721 --> 1:24:54.321
I mean, are we?

1:24:56.192 --> 1:24:59.193
'Cause it kind of feels like
we're home right now.

1:24:59.195 --> 1:25:00.527
Really?

1:25:01.797 --> 1:25:05.199
I kind of feel like
I checked the "save a life" box

1:25:05.201 --> 1:25:06.600
off my bucket list.

1:25:08.971 --> 1:25:11.238
Now all I want to do
is spend my life

1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:13.140
with the people
I care about.

1:25:14.176 --> 1:25:15.676
I want to check that box.

1:25:16.846 --> 1:25:19.179
Okay, I like that.

1:25:19.181 --> 1:25:21.815
All right, everybody.
Nothing to see here.

1:25:21.817 --> 1:25:23.117
Let's disperse.

1:25:23.119 --> 1:25:24.918
Just another ordinary day
in green hills.

1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:26.587
Carl,
I'll take that chain saw.

1:25:27.089 --> 1:25:28.789
Come on. Let's go!

1:25:28.791 --> 1:25:30.791
You act like
you've never seen a fight

1:25:30.793 --> 1:25:35.462
between
an intergalactic space rodent
and a robot with a doctorate.

1:25:44.306 --> 1:25:46.206
You got enough there?

1:25:46.208 --> 1:25:48.275
Yes, Mr. Manager.
Need any more?

1:25:48.277 --> 1:25:49.910
You get that away.

1:26:00.322 --> 1:26:02.156
Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski?

1:26:03.025 --> 1:26:04.324
Yes?

1:26:06.295 --> 1:26:08.195
A token of appreciation
from your government,

1:26:08.197 --> 1:26:11.732
for keeping quiet
about recent incidents,
which never occurred.

1:26:14.036 --> 1:26:15.669
Wow!

1:26:15.671 --> 1:26:18.438
Wonder what it is.
Money to fix the house?

1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:20.908
Letter from the president?
You'll see.

1:26:20.910 --> 1:26:22.543
Okay.

1:26:25.347 --> 1:26:27.481
- Olive garden.
- Hmm, yeah.

1:26:27.483 --> 1:26:29.917
The way you said "you'll see"
made me think

1:26:29.919 --> 1:26:31.852
it was something better
than the things we said.

1:26:31.854 --> 1:26:34.721
Have you tried their
never ending pasta bowl?

1:26:34.723 --> 1:26:36.356
It never ends.

1:26:36.358 --> 1:26:38.659
That sounds... fancy.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1:26:38.661 --> 1:26:41.962
Well, thank you.
We appreciate the gesture.

1:26:41.964 --> 1:26:45.098
Oh, hey. I guess
we can close the file
on that robotnik guy, huh?

1:26:45.100 --> 1:26:46.166
Just disappeared.

1:26:46.168 --> 1:26:47.534
I'm sorry,

1:26:47.536 --> 1:26:50.904
but no such person exists
or ever has existed.

1:26:52.174 --> 1:26:53.473
I wish that were true.

1:26:53.475 --> 1:26:55.075
You haven't by any chance
been in contact

1:26:55.077 --> 1:26:57.811
with a certain alien creature
since the incident, have you?

1:26:57.813 --> 1:26:59.646
Uncle Sam would love
to have a chat with him.

1:26:59.648 --> 1:27:02.482
Very casual.
Brunch, perhaps.

1:27:04.019 --> 1:27:05.252
Oh, you mean
the little blue guy.

1:27:05.254 --> 1:27:06.253
Mmm.
No.

1:27:06.255 --> 1:27:08.322
No, nothing. No.
Mm-mmm.

1:27:08.324 --> 1:27:10.757
Doubt we'll ever
hear from him again.
Mm-mmm.

1:27:11.227 --> 1:27:12.826
Very well.

1:27:13.195 --> 1:27:14.795
Okay.

1:27:14.797 --> 1:27:16.496
Thank you.
Great.

1:27:16.498 --> 1:27:17.664
Mmm.

1:27:18.534 --> 1:27:19.399
Yep.

1:27:22.771 --> 1:27:25.138
To be honest, I'm pretty
pumped about the pasta bowl.

1:27:26.475 --> 1:27:28.208
So, do you guys wanna
watch a movie or what?

1:27:28.210 --> 1:27:29.509
Sorry, buddy,
it's a school night.

1:27:29.511 --> 1:27:31.144
It's time for you
to go back to your cave.

1:27:31.146 --> 1:27:33.313
What?
It's 3:00 in the afternoon!

1:27:33.315 --> 1:27:35.048
You know how you get
when you're tired. Come on.

1:27:35.050 --> 1:27:36.516
Me? I'm not like anything.

1:27:36.518 --> 1:27:39.753
You guys are so uncool.
Yeah, yeah, we know.

1:27:39.755 --> 1:27:41.688
Hey, buddy, where you going?

1:27:41.690 --> 1:27:43.523
You said I have to
go back to my cave.

1:27:44.059 --> 1:27:45.492
We did.

1:28:00.109 --> 1:28:02.776
Oh, my-- are you kidding me?

1:28:04.113 --> 1:28:05.946
I can't believe it.

1:28:05.948 --> 1:28:07.447
How did you--

1:28:08.083 --> 1:28:10.417
it's-- it's all here.

1:28:20.429 --> 1:28:22.796
Look at this! Are you kidding?
And the beanbag?

1:28:22.798 --> 1:28:24.865
No way!
How did you even get this?

1:28:24.867 --> 1:28:27.634
And you got it
all the way over--
oh!

1:28:27.636 --> 1:28:29.803
I love it, I love it,
I love it, I love it!

1:28:32.408 --> 1:28:36.043
Well, welcome home.

1:28:36.045 --> 1:28:38.779
Thank you, so much.

1:28:47.556 --> 1:28:48.989
<i> Oh, no, you don't.</i>

1:28:48.991 --> 1:28:51.858
<i>No second-best animal friends</i>
<i>allowed in my room.</i>

1:28:51.860 --> 1:28:53.660
<i> Wait. What are you doing?</i>

1:28:53.662 --> 1:28:55.996
<i> Stay away from me.</i>
<i> Stop it!</i>

1:28:55.998 --> 1:28:58.265
<i> I'm warning you.</i>
<i> I've got nunchucks!</i>

1:28:58.267 --> 1:29:00.734
<i> Hey, stop.</i>
<i> Okay, you can stay.</i>

1:29:17.820 --> 1:29:21.722
My grasp on sanity remains...
Absolute.

1:29:23.225 --> 1:29:24.991
Isn't that right,
agent stone?

1:29:29.832 --> 1:29:32.199
Why don't you get a head start?

1:29:34.002 --> 1:29:37.070
Do some rock-connaissance.

1:29:37.072 --> 1:29:40.273
Rock-connaissance!
Come on! That's hilarious!

1:29:40.275 --> 1:29:41.942
What's the matter with you?

1:29:41.944 --> 1:29:45.612
Here's the "sitch."
Uninhabited planet.

1:29:46.782 --> 1:29:51.051
No resources, no supplies,
no apparent way home.

1:29:53.389 --> 1:29:55.155
A lesser man would die here.

1:29:58.293 --> 1:30:00.127
I'll be home by Christmas.

1:30:19.548 --> 1:30:21.748
Rock-connaissance!

1:30:24.620 --> 1:30:27.020
Come on! Cheer up!

1:32:28.577 --> 1:32:31.211
If these readings are accurate,
he's here.

1:32:31.213 --> 1:32:32.512
I found him.

1:32:32.514 --> 1:32:34.648
I just hope I'm not too late.
