I'm Santa.

28:20.296 --> 28:24.255
Paul, don't you think that Snowflake
should fetch Santa a Snapple?

28:24.334 --> 28:27.736
Of course you should.
You're an elf.

28:27.804 --> 28:30.569
Exactly. And I'll need
a foot rub later too. Thanks.

28:30.640 --> 28:35.737
Uh,you know what, Santa? I think
I have a Snapple in my little elf house.

28:39.949 --> 28:43.010
- â€œFetch me a Snappleâ€œ?
- You're supposed to be Santa's helper.

28:43.086 --> 28:45.578
Oh, that's a load of crap.
You're doing this deliberately.

28:45.655 --> 28:48.522
- Doing what? - Trying to get back
at me because I broke up with you.

28:48.591 --> 28:52.027
Hey, Snowflake, you're an elf.
It's your job. Get over yourself.

28:52.095 --> 28:54.029
- Stop taunting me.
- I'm not taunting you.

28:54.097 --> 28:57.465
Look, the reason that I did this
to begin with was to get away from you.

28:57.534 --> 29:00.435
You think I wanna be here?
Isabel roped me into this.

29:00.503 --> 29:02.335
Then we'll keep to ourselves,
and we'll be fine.

29:02.405 --> 29:03.600
- Fine.
- Perfect.
