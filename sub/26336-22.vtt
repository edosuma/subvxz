Get in.

That wasn't the deal.

The deal's changed.

Get in the car,

<i>Damn, Joons.</i>

01:32.504 --> 01:35.037
Your dad had it going on.

01:35.106 --> 01:37.673
Thanks.
Yeah, it's not at all weird

01:37.742 --> 01:39.175
to hear you crushing on my dad.

01:39.244 --> 01:40.810
Crushing?
No. I'm just

01:40.879 --> 01:43.346
wondering how you could possibly
share DNA with this man.

01:43.414 --> 01:44.914
Okay.

01:44.983 --> 01:46.383
All right, I'm gonna
let that slide,

01:46.417 --> 01:48.150
okay, since you're
doing me a favor.

01:48.219 --> 01:50.464
Oh, good, yes, very smart of you
since you're getting a free

01:50.488 --> 01:51.866
birthday gift for
your dad out of this.

01:51.890 --> 01:54.323
Hey, no, it's not entirely free.
I still have to get a frame.

01:54.392 --> 01:56.359
Where'd you find
this photo anyway?

01:56.427 --> 01:58.005
Did you recover it from
the wreckage of the <i>Titanic?</i>

01:58.029 --> 02:03.165
Very funny.

02:03.234 --> 02:05.079
All right, well, I'll just
blow past the lecture

02:05.103 --> 02:07.303
about never going through
a woman's closet but,

02:07.372 --> 02:08.770
for future reference...

02:08.840 --> 02:09.840
don't do that.

02:09.907 --> 02:10.973
- Copy.
- Okay.

02:11.042 --> 02:12.842
Okay.

02:12.911 --> 02:14.043
That was their
senior year.

02:14.112 --> 02:15.589
It's hard to believe
my parents were ever

02:15.613 --> 02:18.381
this happy and carefree.
You think can restore it?

02:18.449 --> 02:21.484
Their carefree
happiness? No.

02:21.553 --> 02:22.919
- Oh, the picture.
- Yeah.

02:22.987 --> 02:25.655
Yeah, I can do the picture.

02:25.723 --> 02:28.824
So I guess, uh, things are still
okay with you and your dad?

02:28.893 --> 02:29.992
Yeah.

02:30.061 --> 02:33.496
They're better than okay.
You know...

02:33.565 --> 02:35.631
it's like there was
this distance between us

02:35.700 --> 02:38.401
when my sister died, but now
it feels like it's-it's gone.

02:38.469 --> 02:41.037
What changed?

02:41.105 --> 02:42.772
Uh, he finally
let himself grieve.

02:42.840 --> 02:46.542
Turns out you can only bottle
that stuff up for so long.

02:48.313 --> 02:50.413
You are so in touch
with your emotions.

02:50.481 --> 02:52.782
- No, I-I'm very tapped into my emotions.
- Yeah.

02:52.850 --> 02:55.418
Wow. I mean, it's true,
because I-I saw your Spotify.

02:55.486 --> 02:57.019
Mm-hmm.

02:57.088 --> 02:59.789
Is it legal to have that much
Boyz II Men on a playlist?

02:59.857 --> 03:02.224
I don't...
I think that's illegal.

03:10.768 --> 03:12.468
Hey, Adam, I was just
gonna call you.

03:12.537 --> 03:20.843
- You have a visitor.
- Oh, yeah? Who?

03:20.912 --> 03:22.192
Tamiko. I kind of get
the feeling

03:22.246 --> 03:25.815
she was supposed to be
somewhere else right now.

03:25.883 --> 03:27.717
Anyway,
Detective Williams

03:27.785 --> 03:30.386
is out today, so I
put her in his office.

03:30.455 --> 03:32.388
All right.
Thanks, Jer.

03:38.329 --> 03:40.296
Adam!

03:40.365 --> 03:42.098
I'm so sorry.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.000
I didn't know who else
I could talk to.

03:44.068 --> 03:45.635
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

03:45.703 --> 03:48.204
I'm glad you found me.

03:48.272 --> 03:51.474
Hey... hey.

03:51.542 --> 03:53.175
Tell me what's going on.

03:53.244 --> 03:56.579
Well, today is my wedding day--

03:56.648 --> 04:00.282
obviously-- only my fiancé
didn't show up to the ceremony.

04:00.351 --> 04:01.951
And now he's missing.

04:02.020 --> 04:03.786
I'm sorry.

04:06.524 --> 04:08.697
Do you think
it's possible that he...

04:08.721 --> 04:10.721
What, that he got cold feet?

04:11.796 --> 04:13.596
Trust me, at this point...

04:13.665 --> 04:15.598
I'm praying that's the case.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.933
I take it you have reason
to believe otherwise?

04:26.210 --> 04:27.677
I'm so sorry, Noelani.

04:27.745 --> 04:31.013
Dr. Chu. Oh, thank God
you're okay.

04:33.484 --> 04:35.004
I shouldn't have
dragged you into this,

04:35.053 --> 04:36.419
but I had no choice.

04:36.487 --> 04:39.088
They took me from my house,
showed me pictures of my kids.

04:39.157 --> 04:39.837
They know where they live.

04:39.838 --> 04:41.858
Okay, slow down. Just tell me
what's going on.

04:42.226 --> 04:43.492
What do they want from you?

04:43.561 --> 04:46.529
They want me to perform
an operation.

04:46.597 --> 04:48.964
On who?

04:49.033 --> 04:50.766
They wouldn't say.

04:52.103 --> 04:53.469
All I know is...

04:53.538 --> 04:55.204
the patient's aortic valve
is failing

04:55.273 --> 04:56.706
and he needs a new one.

04:56.774 --> 04:59.709
And whoever it is obviously
can't go through legit channels.

04:59.777 --> 05:01.977
Which is where
I come in.

05:02.046 --> 05:03.279
I'm so sorry.

05:03.347 --> 05:05.014
You're the only person
I could think of

05:05.083 --> 05:07.550
who had immediate access
to a valve.

05:07.618 --> 05:09.719
- Why did they choose you?
- Who knows.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.654
Make enough of those
top ten surgeon lists,

05:11.723 --> 05:13.389
people start to know your name.

05:13.458 --> 05:17.193
Noelani, you're not just here
to deliver the valve.

05:17.261 --> 05:19.195
A procedure like this--

05:19.263 --> 05:21.197
I can't do it on my own.

05:21.265 --> 05:24.767
You want me to assist you
in a valve transplant?

05:24.836 --> 05:27.269
You know I only work
on dead people now, right?

05:27.338 --> 05:29.271
You had the best hands
of anyone I ever trained,

05:29.340 --> 05:31.040
which is good,

05:31.109 --> 05:33.909
because there is
no margin for error here.

05:33.978 --> 05:36.011
If this guy dies...

05:36.080 --> 05:37.713
they're not just
going to kill me.

05:42.987 --> 05:44.220
Hey.

05:44.288 --> 05:46.922
Hey, Steve, this is Tamiko.

05:46.991 --> 05:48.190
She and I grew up together.

05:48.259 --> 05:50.860
Our, uh, families
were friends back in Japan.

05:50.928 --> 05:52.495
Tamiko, nice to meet you.

05:52.563 --> 05:54.330
Nice to meet you.

05:54.398 --> 05:56.031
Tamiko, will you tell Steve

05:56.100 --> 05:58.601
what you told me
about your fiancé?

05:58.669 --> 06:00.636
It's okay, you can trust him.

06:02.907 --> 06:04.607
Um...

06:04.675 --> 06:08.244
I met him last year when
he came to work for my family.

06:08.312 --> 06:11.680
Our connection was instant.

06:11.749 --> 06:13.983
With my father's blessing,
we got engaged.

06:15.353 --> 06:18.888
Recently, I could tell
that something was...

06:18.956 --> 06:20.689
bothering him.

06:20.758 --> 06:23.893
And then he told me what.

06:23.961 --> 06:26.996
His real name is Kevin Okada,

06:27.064 --> 06:29.565
and he's an agent with the FBI.

06:30.892 --> 06:31.653
Okay.

06:31.677 --> 06:33.403
He's been working undercover

06:33.404 --> 06:35.805
in my father's organization.

06:35.873 --> 06:38.073
Forgive me, who exactly
is your father?

06:38.142 --> 06:40.810
Hajime Masuda.

06:48.352 --> 06:50.452
Uh, I presume your father

06:50.521 --> 06:52.621
doesn't know this
about your fiancé?

06:53.724 --> 06:56.158
I am the only one who knows.

06:56.227 --> 06:59.128
Well, that's what I thought.

06:59.197 --> 07:00.462
But now that he's missing...

07:00.531 --> 07:01.730
He's missing.

07:01.799 --> 07:03.666
Tamiko...

07:03.734 --> 07:05.301
tell him what happened
last night.

07:05.369 --> 07:07.336
Um...

07:07.405 --> 07:09.839
my father summoned Kevin,
unexpectedly,

07:09.907 --> 07:12.107
to meet, said it was urgent.

07:12.176 --> 07:15.878
I told myself it was just...

07:15.947 --> 07:18.848
a father giving pre-wedding
advice to his son-in-law.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.883
With all due respect, Tamiko,

07:20.952 --> 07:22.685
your father's the head
of the yakuza,

07:22.753 --> 07:24.320
so, I mean, some people
would consider

07:24.388 --> 07:27.923
an unplanned meeting
something to worry about.

07:29.026 --> 07:30.593
- Okay.
- Kevin called me after

07:30.661 --> 07:32.094
and said everything was fine.

07:32.163 --> 07:33.829
Mm-hmm.

07:35.399 --> 07:37.639
And when he didn't show up
for the ceremony this morning,

07:37.668 --> 07:40.736
I went to his hotel room
looking for him.

07:40.805 --> 07:42.638
Um...

07:44.709 --> 07:47.009
That's when I found this.

07:51.682 --> 07:53.282
What's it say?

07:54.385 --> 07:55.951
"Traitor."

08:01.162 --> 08:04.692
So still no luck tracking down
our missing groom/FBI agent.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.471
I tried to ping his phone
but it's powered down,

08:06.495 --> 08:08.162
so I put out a BOLO on his car.

08:08.230 --> 08:09.274
I don't think he got cold feet.

08:09.298 --> 08:11.598
I looked into his financials
and there is no

08:11.667 --> 08:13.133
large withdrawals,
no plane tickets,

08:13.202 --> 08:14.601
or any other purchases
suggesting

08:14.670 --> 08:17.704
- that he was planning to disappear.
- What about the Feds?

08:17.773 --> 08:19.651
They couldn't have been happy
their undercover was marrying

08:19.675 --> 08:21.520
into the family they were
building a case against.

08:21.544 --> 08:22.954
So, what, you think
they pulled him out?

08:22.978 --> 08:25.446
I mean, that would make sense
if they knew about the wedding,

08:25.514 --> 08:27.281
but I spoke with Okada's
handler and he said

08:27.349 --> 08:28.816
that they were
completely in the dark

08:28.884 --> 08:30.818
about the relationship
between Okada and Tamiko.

08:30.886 --> 08:34.087
Which leads us back
to the most likely scenario.

08:34.155 --> 08:35.756
His cover was blown

08:35.825 --> 08:37.501
and the yakuza killed him.
- All right, I think

08:37.525 --> 08:39.966
it's time we went and had a chat
with the father of the bride.

08:39.995 --> 08:41.929
Yeah, except Hajime Masuda's

08:41.996 --> 08:43.674
one of the most powerful men
on the Island.

08:43.698 --> 08:45.132
He's basically untouchable.

08:45.201 --> 08:46.433
Jerry's right.

08:46.502 --> 08:47.935
That guy's not gonna talk to us.

08:48.003 --> 08:49.103
No.

08:49.171 --> 08:51.105
But he might talk to me.

08:53.709 --> 08:57.144
<i>Of course they send</i>
<i>a familiar face.</i>

08:57.213 --> 08:59.279
Imagine I'll be more receptive.

08:59.348 --> 09:02.182
Masuda-San,
I mean no disrespect.

09:02.251 --> 09:06.186
Yet you come to my home and ask
me if I had anything to do

09:06.255 --> 09:08.922
with the disappearance
of my daughter's fiancé.

09:08.991 --> 09:10.858
Well, did you?

09:10.926 --> 09:14.661
That badge has certainly
emboldened you, Mr. Noshimuri.

09:14.730 --> 09:15.996
That wasn't an answer.

09:18.567 --> 09:22.069
My time is valuable, and I have
my daughter to tend to,

09:22.138 --> 09:25.005
so let's stop talking
in circles, shall we?

09:26.408 --> 09:28.509
We both know this man was FBI.

09:28.577 --> 09:31.211
But to answer
your question,

09:31.280 --> 09:35.015
no, I had nothing to do
with his disappearance.

09:35.084 --> 09:36.517
Really?

09:36.585 --> 09:39.620
So you were going to let
your daughter marry a man

09:39.688 --> 09:41.622
whose goal was to take down

09:41.690 --> 09:43.290
your entire organization?

09:44.393 --> 09:45.826
You don't have children, do you?

09:47.229 --> 09:49.229
No, I don't.

09:49.298 --> 09:51.665
Well, when you do,
you will understand

09:51.734 --> 09:53.133
the lengths a father will go to

09:53.202 --> 09:55.769
to protect their happiness.

09:56.472 --> 09:58.005
Even if it costs you

09:58.073 --> 09:59.940
everything.

10:04.580 --> 10:06.013
As I'm sure you heard,

10:06.081 --> 10:08.815
Tamiko was married once before,

10:08.884 --> 10:10.918
to someone of my choosing.

10:12.354 --> 10:14.955
It didn't end well.

10:15.024 --> 10:17.090
But this time...

10:17.159 --> 10:19.359
I saw how happy she was.

10:19.428 --> 10:20.794
So what was the meeting about?

10:25.734 --> 10:29.369
Tamiko told me you summoned
Kevin here last night.

10:29.438 --> 10:32.839
I informed Mr. Okada that I knew
who he was working for.

10:34.577 --> 10:37.444
I also told him that I was...

10:37.513 --> 10:41.215
arranging an off-shore
account for him and Tamiko...

10:41.283 --> 10:43.717
with five million dollars in it.

10:44.820 --> 10:46.920
He was to marry
my daughter and...

10:48.591 --> 10:51.391
...take her on their honeymoon.

10:51.460 --> 10:53.493
Then they were to disappear.

10:53.562 --> 10:55.862
Forever.

10:55.931 --> 10:58.265
And Tamiko knew nothing
of this plan?

11:02.271 --> 11:04.438
A father's sacrifice then, huh?

11:07.676 --> 11:08.887
I understand it's
hard to believe

11:08.911 --> 11:11.645
that I was willing to
send her away and...

11:11.714 --> 11:14.715
never see her again, but...

11:14.783 --> 11:17.618
it was the only way
I could protect her future.

11:22.091 --> 11:24.157
<i>I know he had</i>

11:24.226 --> 11:25.470
all the motive
in the world, Steve,

11:25.494 --> 11:28.028
my gut tells me Masuda
had nothing to do

11:28.097 --> 11:29.363
with Okada's disappearance.

11:29.431 --> 11:30.642
Well, I mean,
his story checks out,

11:30.666 --> 11:32.366
at least about
the five million dollars.

11:32.434 --> 11:34.234
Jerry looked into
the offshore account.

11:34.303 --> 11:36.670
Masuda set it up in both
Okada and Tamiko's names.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.105
And it's all still there.

11:38.173 --> 11:40.440
At least we know Okada
didn't run off with the money.

11:40.509 --> 11:41.808
Right. We got any indication

11:41.877 --> 11:44.011
how Masuda made Okada as FBI?

11:44.079 --> 11:45.946
No, a-and I didn't ask.

11:46.015 --> 11:48.448
Mainly because i-it's a question
he would never answer.

11:48.517 --> 11:50.584
There's another possibility
here, you know.

11:50.653 --> 11:53.020
Masuda wasn't the only person
who had a lot to lose

11:53.088 --> 11:54.955
if the FBI
made this case, right?

11:55.024 --> 11:56.857
What if somebody inside
Masuda's organization

11:56.925 --> 11:58.970
realized it was a problem
and decided to take care of it?

11:58.994 --> 12:01.361
I don't know, Steve.
Killing Masuda's

12:01.430 --> 12:03.630
future son-in-law
without his permission?

12:03.699 --> 12:05.510
That's basically signing
your own death warrant. -

12:05.534 --> 12:06.900
Hey.

12:06.969 --> 12:08.268
I just heard from Duke.

12:08.337 --> 12:09.870
Our missing groom's
body's been found.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.672
Adam, you get that?

12:14.610 --> 12:17.477
Hey, Duke. What do we got?

12:17.546 --> 12:18.845
Call came in
an hour ago.

12:18.914 --> 12:21.048
But it looks like the car's
been here for some time.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.717
According to the M.E., he's been
dead for at least six hours.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.285
All right.
Guy is garroted

12:25.354 --> 12:28.488
in his own car.
Left in plain sight.

12:28.557 --> 12:30.891
Well, whoever did this obviously
wanted us to find him.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.492
Yeah, they're sending a message.

12:32.561 --> 12:34.027
I think you're
right about that.

12:37.566 --> 12:39.499
M.E. found this in his mouth.

12:39.568 --> 12:42.069
Oh, yeah, rat in the mouth.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.471
So either Masuda's lying to us

12:44.540 --> 12:47.341
and the yakuza actually did kill him...
- Or someone's trying

12:47.409 --> 12:49.209
very hard
to make it look that way.

13:35.067 --> 13:37.000
I need to speak
to your daughter.

14:11.904 --> 14:14.070
After my first marriage ended...

14:15.807 --> 14:17.674
...I told myself
I would never get involved

14:17.743 --> 14:19.676
with someone
with yakuza ties again.

14:22.648 --> 14:24.581
Then I met Kevin.

14:24.650 --> 14:27.717
And he was kind and caring
and completely different

14:27.786 --> 14:30.320
from anyone
my father did business with.

14:32.391 --> 14:34.057
Turned out there was
a reason for that.

14:38.497 --> 14:40.063
I'm a fool for thinking
it would work.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.232
No.

14:42.301 --> 14:44.367
That this would end
any other way?

14:44.436 --> 14:45.635
No. No, you're not.

14:47.205 --> 14:49.139
And this isn't your fault.

14:55.414 --> 14:57.480
You know...

14:57.549 --> 14:59.015
...if our families had
had their way,

14:59.084 --> 15:00.917
you and I would be
married right now.

15:02.955 --> 15:06.122
Probably with kids
running around by this point.

15:06.191 --> 15:08.391
Yeah, they never held
back when it came to

15:08.460 --> 15:11.227
voicing that opinion, did they?

15:11.296 --> 15:12.596
My mother...

15:14.800 --> 15:16.266
...always made a point
of telling me

15:16.335 --> 15:18.168
how handsome
she thought you were.

15:18.236 --> 15:19.936
Oh.

15:20.005 --> 15:21.237
Why, thank you, Mom.

15:23.775 --> 15:26.343
My father-- he was
less subtle.

15:26.411 --> 15:29.145
He just told me our marriage

15:29.214 --> 15:31.214
would be great for business.

15:31.283 --> 15:34.317
- Oh, no, I got that speech, too.
- Good.

15:34.386 --> 15:35.852
Listen.

15:37.723 --> 15:39.689
The truth is I've always
thought highly of you.

15:41.793 --> 15:44.461
I just didn't want other people
planning my life for me.

15:46.999 --> 15:48.698
So I followed my heart instead.

15:51.937 --> 15:53.603
And ended up...

15:53.672 --> 15:56.873
falling in love with
just about the last person

15:56.942 --> 15:58.775
my father would have
approved of.

15:58.844 --> 16:01.778
I was sorry to hear it didn't
work out with you and Kono.

16:03.081 --> 16:05.015
Yeah.

16:08.353 --> 16:10.053
Hey, listen.

16:10.122 --> 16:12.055
You should know...

16:14.559 --> 16:16.004
...right now, we don't
think your father

16:16.028 --> 16:18.228
had anything to do
with Kevin's death.

16:19.331 --> 16:20.797
Does it matter
who gave the order?

16:25.804 --> 16:29.239
I've spent my whole life
with this sh-shadow...

16:29.307 --> 16:30.874
looming over me.

16:30.942 --> 16:34.577
No matter how far I run,
it just follows me.

16:41.653 --> 16:43.019
I'll never get free of it.

16:44.589 --> 16:45.589
Hey.

16:45.624 --> 16:46.956
Listen to me.

16:48.493 --> 16:49.826
I know it feels that way.

16:51.763 --> 16:53.296
The expectations of your family,

16:53.365 --> 16:55.565
the assumptions of others.

16:56.802 --> 16:58.768
But you can get free of it.

17:00.105 --> 17:01.905
Look at me.

17:01.973 --> 17:04.107
I did.

17:26.798 --> 17:28.531
We've got a problem here.

17:29.501 --> 17:30.533
What's wrong?

17:30.602 --> 17:33.136
It's the valve.

17:33.205 --> 17:34.971
There's significant
calcification on it.

17:36.742 --> 17:37.819
It's not something you
could've determined.

17:37.843 --> 17:39.676
- Not under the circumstances.
- Hey.

17:39.745 --> 17:42.011
What's going on?

17:43.315 --> 17:45.115
The valve isn't viable
for transplant.

17:45.183 --> 17:46.116
What?

17:46.184 --> 17:47.450
It's not her fault.

17:47.519 --> 17:49.352
I don't care who's fault it is.

17:49.421 --> 17:50.498
How are you gonna fix this?

17:50.522 --> 17:52.889
We'll just...
get another valve.

17:53.859 --> 17:54.958
That's not gonna happen.

17:55.026 --> 17:56.493
It is if you want him to live.

17:57.262 --> 17:59.429
She got us a bad valve.

17:59.498 --> 18:01.743
Look, I can go back tonight.
Get another one from the morgue.

18:01.767 --> 18:03.207
Like I said,
that's not gonna happen.

18:03.869 --> 18:05.335
Oh, my God!

18:07.639 --> 18:09.172
There's your fresh valve.

18:09.241 --> 18:10.607
Get to work.

18:12.811 --> 18:14.377
<i>So, now that we've moved off</i>

18:14.446 --> 18:16.513
of Masuda as a suspect,
I started looking into

18:16.581 --> 18:18.848
who else might've wanted
Agent Okada dead.

18:18.917 --> 18:21.818
I figured a good place to start
would be his previous cases.

18:21.887 --> 18:23.920
That would make sense.
Anybody he put away

18:23.989 --> 18:25.889
- would certainly have motive.
- Precisely.

18:25.957 --> 18:28.758
So, during his time at
the Bureau, Okada had

18:28.827 --> 18:30.226
eight UC assignments.

18:30.295 --> 18:33.296
All of which were on the
mainland, except one.

18:33.365 --> 18:36.599
Six years ago, he was embedded
on Maui, gathering Intel

18:36.668 --> 18:37.600
on this guy:

18:37.669 --> 18:41.070
Ron Craft. Okada
worked undercover

18:41.139 --> 18:43.640
at Craft's chemical
supply business.

18:43.708 --> 18:45.319
And, lo and behold,
it turned out to be a front

18:45.343 --> 18:47.844
for a massive
methamphetamine operation.

18:47.913 --> 18:50.213
Craft was convicted
for trafficking,

18:50.282 --> 18:51.781
did four years
of a 15-year sentence,

18:51.850 --> 18:53.516
and was released
a few months ago.

18:53.585 --> 18:54.984
Why'd he get out so early?

18:55.053 --> 18:56.820
Uh, the conviction
was vacated on appeal.

18:56.888 --> 18:58.988
Chain of evidence
improprieties.

18:59.057 --> 19:00.868
Sounds like the guy had motive
and opportunity to me.

19:00.892 --> 19:03.193
And the last couple months
to track down Okada

19:03.261 --> 19:04.294
and plot his revenge.

19:04.362 --> 19:05.962
So we start with Craft.
Jerry,

19:06.031 --> 19:07.964
we got a current address
on this guy?

19:23.081 --> 19:24.280
Can I help you?

19:24.349 --> 19:25.281
Five-O. We're looking

19:25.350 --> 19:26.482
for Ron Craft.

19:26.551 --> 19:28.151
What's this about?

19:28.220 --> 19:29.586
Ma'am, you need to step aside.

19:32.023 --> 19:33.990
He's gone. He's been
gone a few days now.

19:34.059 --> 19:36.025
Okay, well, do you know
where he is?

19:36.094 --> 19:39.095
On a fishing trip.
He borrowed my brother's boat.

19:42.567 --> 19:44.634
We're gonna need a description
of that vessel.

19:44.703 --> 19:46.903
- Clear.
- Clear?

19:46.972 --> 19:49.606
White sport
fishing boat.

19:49.674 --> 19:51.975
About 25 feet long.
The SS <i>Moray.</i>

19:52.043 --> 19:53.743
Okay, I'm gonna call
this boat in and see

19:53.812 --> 19:55.089
if Coast Guard
can track it down.

19:55.113 --> 19:56.379
- Okay.
- All right.

19:56.448 --> 19:57.892
I don't know what you think
Ron has done,

19:57.916 --> 19:59.616
but this is harassment.

19:59.684 --> 20:00.884
He's already served his time.

20:00.952 --> 20:02.819
Four years, for something
he didn't even do.

20:02.888 --> 20:04.821
You all need to leave us alone.

20:04.890 --> 20:07.357
Ms. Craft,
do you recognize this man?

20:07.425 --> 20:10.760
Um, yeah, that's...
that's Aaron Shibita.

20:10.829 --> 20:12.996
He used to work with Ron.

20:13.064 --> 20:14.998
What does he have to do
with any of this?

20:15.066 --> 20:16.277
Well, I'm sorry to tell you,
but he's dead.

20:16.301 --> 20:18.268
And your husband's
a suspect in his murder.

20:20.639 --> 20:22.939
Aaron wasn't just an employee
of Ron's, he became

20:23.008 --> 20:24.073
part of this family.

20:24.142 --> 20:25.074
Coming over for dinner,

20:25.143 --> 20:27.110
going with us to church,
camping.

20:27.178 --> 20:28.611
Then when Ron went to prison,

20:28.680 --> 20:29.991
his business shut down
and Aaron took a job

20:30.015 --> 20:31.114
in another city.

20:31.182 --> 20:33.116
And you haven't seen
or heard from him since?

20:33.184 --> 20:34.450
Well, not directly.

20:34.519 --> 20:36.119
What do you mean by that?

20:36.187 --> 20:39.589
Before he moved away,
Aaron said he wanted to help.

20:39.658 --> 20:42.025
I was pregnant at the time.

20:42.093 --> 20:43.404
And pretty scared
about getting by

20:43.428 --> 20:45.628
with Ron gone for so many years.

20:45.697 --> 20:48.464
So Aaron gave me some money.

20:48.533 --> 20:50.967
And ever since,
he has sent me $200

20:51.036 --> 20:52.702
every month.

20:52.771 --> 20:56.005
It may not seem like a lot, but
it has made a huge difference.

20:56.074 --> 20:58.474
Did your husband know that Aaron
was sending you money?

20:58.543 --> 21:01.711
Not while he was in prison.
Aaron told me not to tell him.

21:01.780 --> 21:04.013
He was worried
that Ron would be upset.

21:04.082 --> 21:05.348
You know, because of his pride.

21:05.417 --> 21:07.617
And so, when Ron
got out last month?

21:07.686 --> 21:10.119
He asked a lot of questions
about how I made ends meet

21:10.188 --> 21:11.188
all these years.

21:11.222 --> 21:14.157
So I told him
about Aaron helping out.

21:14.225 --> 21:16.893
But the thing is,
he wasn't mad at all.

21:16.962 --> 21:18.661
He actually seemed
pleased about it.

21:18.730 --> 21:19.862
So, Mrs. Craft,

21:19.931 --> 21:21.397
can you tell us
exactly how Aaron

21:21.466 --> 21:22.732
was sending you all this money?

21:22.801 --> 21:25.935
He'd wire a money order
to the post office.

21:26.004 --> 21:27.270
Why?

21:29.607 --> 21:30.873
So it looks like our Vic Okada

21:30.942 --> 21:32.809
was the FBI agent
with a heart of gold.

21:32.877 --> 21:34.622
Yeah, well, he sure made a habit
of getting involved

21:34.646 --> 21:36.679
with the subjects
of his investigations.

21:36.748 --> 21:39.482
Craft gets out of jail, he
hears that his old buddy Aaron

21:39.551 --> 21:40.843
skipped town around
the time of his arrest.

21:40.867 --> 21:41.885
Mm-hmm.

21:41.886 --> 21:43.786
He puts together that
Aaron was the undercover

21:43.855 --> 21:45.321
that built the case against him

21:45.390 --> 21:47.201
and normally, he wouldn't have
a way of tracking him down...

21:47.225 --> 21:48.703
But thanks to Aaron's
generosity, you know,

21:48.727 --> 21:50.338
he gets this massive lead:
all the payments

21:50.362 --> 21:51.706
he was making to Craft's wife.
- Right.

21:51.730 --> 21:54.797
And then, so he traces
the money orders back to Oahu,

21:54.866 --> 21:57.400
he finds out that Aaron
is undercover,

21:57.469 --> 21:59.068
building a case
against the yakuza.

21:59.137 --> 22:02.071
And then Craft kills him and
makes it look like a yakuza hit.

22:12.150 --> 22:13.583
Patient fully induced.

22:13.651 --> 22:16.085
EKG looks normal.

22:16.154 --> 22:17.587
CBM prepped and clear.

22:17.655 --> 22:18.966
Keep an eye on the MAP
as we work.

22:18.990 --> 22:20.890
Copy. Nothing above 70.

22:20.959 --> 22:22.392
We ready to do this?

22:23.495 --> 22:25.495
Actually, one small problem.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.466
What is it?

22:30.535 --> 22:33.703
She needs to use the restroom.

22:33.772 --> 22:34.904
Not happening.

22:34.973 --> 22:36.906
We're about to start a very long

22:36.975 --> 22:39.075
and complicated procedure.

22:39.144 --> 22:40.710
I need her focused
and distraction-free.

22:41.813 --> 22:43.212
Trust me,

22:43.281 --> 22:44.925
you'd rather she go now
than once we've started

22:44.949 --> 22:46.916
and the patient's chest
is split wide open.

22:51.589 --> 22:52.688
Go with her.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.840
You're really gonna
follow me in there?

23:10.909 --> 23:12.375
Just make it quick.

23:30.195 --> 23:32.128
Hey, where is she?

23:35.300 --> 23:39.001
Do exactly what I say and
don't move, or I'll shoot you.

23:39.070 --> 23:42.004
Now hand your gun
to Dr. Chu, slowly.

23:43.274 --> 23:44.607
Do it, now.

23:49.581 --> 23:51.247
Now get on the ground,
face down.

23:52.350 --> 23:54.750
And don't move.

23:55.854 --> 23:57.787
Let's go.

23:59.124 --> 24:00.790
Go, go, go!

24:02.193 --> 24:03.526
Come on.

24:09.100 --> 24:10.299
We got to get out of here.

24:10.368 --> 24:12.268
There.

24:40.798 --> 24:41.798
What are you doing?

24:41.833 --> 24:43.166
I can't let you leave.

24:43.234 --> 24:45.801
Tara, are you working for them?

24:51.442 --> 24:52.442
I'm sorry.

25:04.232 --> 25:05.465
Forceps.

25:08.738 --> 25:09.738
Suture.

25:10.738 --> 25:11.738
Suture.

25:12.807 --> 25:14.240
I worshiped you.

25:14.309 --> 25:16.042
Noelani, please...

25:16.111 --> 25:17.677
You knew that.

25:17.745 --> 25:19.223
That's how you knew
you could lure me here.

25:19.247 --> 25:21.047
You knew I'd do anything
to help you.

25:22.584 --> 25:24.350
Because at the lowest time
in my life,

25:24.419 --> 25:27.954
when even my own mother
wouldn't believe in me, you did.

25:28.022 --> 25:29.889
A lot's happened since then.

25:29.958 --> 25:32.492
- I don't expect you to understand.
- Try me.

25:35.430 --> 25:38.531
There was a malpractice claim
against me.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.032
I did everything by the book,

25:40.101 --> 25:43.603
but the hospital
needed a scapegoat.

25:43.671 --> 25:47.306
I gave my life to that place,
and they hung me out to dry.

25:47.375 --> 25:50.143
The legal fees bankrupted me.

25:50.211 --> 25:53.179
I was the same surgeon
with the same skills

25:53.248 --> 25:55.848
with nowhere to use them.

25:55.917 --> 25:58.885
So now I use them like this.

25:58.953 --> 26:01.554
I am still saving lives.

26:01.623 --> 26:03.256
Yeah, of criminals.

26:05.426 --> 26:07.393
They're going to kill me.

26:07.462 --> 26:08.561
You know that, right?

26:08.630 --> 26:09.795
No, you're safe.

26:09.864 --> 26:11.197
I made a deal with them.

26:11.266 --> 26:12.743
Yeah? What about the guy
whose valve we're using?

26:12.767 --> 26:14.033
You think he had a deal, too?

26:14.102 --> 26:15.613
I'm too valuable to them.
They need me.

26:15.637 --> 26:18.404
You know, you can lie to me,
but don't lie to yourself.

26:20.141 --> 26:22.041
There's only one way
this ends for me.

26:22.110 --> 26:24.911
Here's what I know for sure:

26:24.979 --> 26:26.579
you know the guy
who's calls the shots,

26:26.648 --> 26:28.514
the one who brought you here?

26:29.884 --> 26:32.885
This is his father
we're operating on.

26:32.954 --> 26:35.288
So if we screw up...

26:35.356 --> 26:37.557
You saw what he did
to his own man.

26:37.625 --> 26:39.559
What do you think
he'll do to us?

26:40.662 --> 26:42.128
Now, please,

26:42.197 --> 26:44.931
hand me the damn suture.

26:59.514 --> 27:00.446
Hey, Jer, what's up?

27:00.515 --> 27:01.447
Good news. Coast Guard

27:01.516 --> 27:03.249
tracked down Ron Craft's boat.

27:03.318 --> 27:04.750
That was fast. Where is it?

27:04.819 --> 27:06.197
Sand Island Pier.
McGarrett and Adam

27:06.221 --> 27:07.520
are on their way now.

27:07.589 --> 27:09.488
Wait, Craft is still on Oahu?

27:09.557 --> 27:10.997
How does that make sense?
It doesn't.

27:11.059 --> 27:12.325
He just killed a federal agent.

27:12.393 --> 27:14.405
He should be trying to get off
the island, and fast.

27:14.429 --> 27:16.395
Exactly.
So why stick around?

27:50.865 --> 27:52.798
Clear.

27:58.373 --> 28:01.407
Single tap to the back of
the head. Looks professional.

28:01.476 --> 28:04.343
Well, I can think of one person
who'd want Ron Craft dead.

28:04.412 --> 28:05.578
Yeah, Masuda.

28:05.647 --> 28:07.546
Right.

28:07.615 --> 28:09.915
But how the hell did Masuda
track him down before we did?

28:09.984 --> 28:12.518
The same way he found out
Okada was FBI.

28:12.587 --> 28:15.655
He's got to have somebody inside
the Bureau on his payroll.

28:15.723 --> 28:17.323
All right,
let's get CSU down here

28:17.392 --> 28:19.659
and sweep this vessel for prints
and shell casings.

28:19.727 --> 28:21.205
Hopefully, we'll get lucky,
find something

28:21.229 --> 28:23.162
that actually ties us
to Masuda's organization.

28:27.802 --> 28:29.502
Hey, Lou, what's going on?

28:29.570 --> 28:32.938
It's Noelani. Duke reached out
to her several times today

28:33.007 --> 28:34.774
because she never
showed up for work.

28:34.842 --> 28:36.754
But she didn't respond
to any of his calls or texts,

28:36.778 --> 28:38.277
so we sent an officer
by her place.

28:38.346 --> 28:40.179
- Okay, w-what, she wasn't there?
- No.

28:40.248 --> 28:42.181
So he checked
the morgue as well.

28:42.250 --> 28:44.016
A security guard said

28:44.085 --> 28:46.519
that she showed up there early,
like, 4:00 a.m. this morning.

28:46.587 --> 28:49.188
She told him that she was just
picking up some paperwork

28:49.257 --> 28:50.189
for a trial today.

28:50.258 --> 28:51.290
She make it to court?

28:51.359 --> 28:52.558
I checked every trial

28:52.627 --> 28:55.061
on the docket,
and Noelani wasn't scheduled

28:55.129 --> 28:56.562
to be at any one of them.

28:56.631 --> 28:59.432
Why would she lie to the guard?

28:59.500 --> 29:02.034
Blood pressure's 110/80.

29:02.103 --> 29:03.469
I know this
won't mean much

29:03.538 --> 29:05.938
coming from me
right now, but...

29:06.007 --> 29:08.185
Is this the part where you tell
me what a good job I did?

29:08.209 --> 29:11.043
Noelani, If there was any other
way I could've done this,

29:11.112 --> 29:12.812
I would have.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.547
He's all closed up and stable.

29:14.615 --> 29:17.116
- So far so good.
- Okay, good.

29:17.185 --> 29:19.385
You, come with me.

29:19.454 --> 29:20.986
Wait. We had a deal.

29:21.055 --> 29:22.922
Relax.
I'm taking her home.

29:22.990 --> 29:24.490
Then we'll all go together.

29:24.559 --> 29:26.659
Yeah, it's not gonna
work out that way.

29:26.728 --> 29:27.827
Come on, let's go.

29:27.895 --> 29:29.061
Let's go.

29:29.130 --> 29:30.607
- You want your father to live?
- Whoa...

29:30.631 --> 29:32.131
Then that's exactly
how it's gonna go.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.066
- Now put it down.
- Okay, you win.

29:34.135 --> 29:36.015
You win, okay? Just don't
hurt him. Okay? You...

29:37.071 --> 29:38.904
Oh, my God!

29:41.075 --> 29:42.675
Oh...

29:42.744 --> 29:45.444
- I'm so sorry...
- It's okay. Just hold on.

29:45.513 --> 29:48.614
Let's go. Let's go.
I'm not gonna ask you again.

29:48.683 --> 29:50.583
What's happening?

29:50.651 --> 29:52.696
I don't know. It looks like
blood pressure is dropping fast.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.512
You said he was okay.
What do you mean?

29:54.513 --> 29:56.522
Cardiac...
tamponade.

29:56.591 --> 29:58.335
- What does that mean?
- It happens sometimes

29:58.359 --> 29:59.837
after a surgery like this.
It means that

29:59.861 --> 30:01.827
the heart is bleeding
into the sac surrounding it.

30:01.896 --> 30:04.363
- Fix it. Now.
- Go.

30:04.432 --> 30:05.965
- I'll talk you through it.
- No!

30:06.033 --> 30:08.267
- I'm not leaving you.
- You have to.

30:08.336 --> 30:09.835
If he dies,

30:09.904 --> 30:11.137
you die, too.

30:11.205 --> 30:13.372
She's right,
so get up now.

30:13.441 --> 30:14.441
Get up.

30:17.583 --> 30:21.028
I'm no expert, but this doesn't
look like your standard autopsy.

30:21.029 --> 30:23.896
No. It looks like she's pulling
something out of his chest.

30:26.034 --> 30:27.867
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa--
see that? Stop.

30:27.936 --> 30:29.002
Stop-stop, and go back.

30:31.339 --> 30:32.472
Right there.

30:32.540 --> 30:33.951
She's looking
right into the camera.

30:33.975 --> 30:35.908
Like she thinks
somebody's watching her.

30:35.977 --> 30:37.744
Somebody probably is.

30:37.812 --> 30:39.912
I mean, she had to have been
coerced into doing this.

30:39.981 --> 30:41.014
Yeah.

30:41.082 --> 30:42.382
Oh, here we go.

30:42.450 --> 30:44.262
Looks like there was an
external breach of the system

30:44.286 --> 30:46.719
at 3:41 a.m.

30:46.788 --> 30:48.755
So somebody sends Noelani
in here fishing

30:48.823 --> 30:50.290
around for body parts,

30:50.358 --> 30:52.992
making sure that she knows that
they're keeping an eye on her.

30:53.061 --> 30:54.438
Well, it explains
why she couldn't reach out

30:54.462 --> 30:56.396
- to anyone for help.
- But the only reason

30:56.464 --> 30:58.109
Noelani would go through
with something like this

30:58.133 --> 30:59.310
is if somebody had
some leverage on her.

30:59.334 --> 31:01.234
Hey, I just spoke to security

31:01.303 --> 31:02.769
at the county morgue.
They sent over

31:02.837 --> 31:04.881
the sign-in logs
from this morning.

31:04.882 --> 31:06.649
The on-duty guard remembers

31:06.718 --> 31:08.751
<i>Noelani signing in,</i>
<i>which struck him as odd</i>

31:08.820 --> 31:10.064
<i>because she usually</i>
<i>swipes a badge.</i>

31:10.088 --> 31:13.022
And it makes sense when you
see what what she wrote.

31:14.325 --> 31:15.825
Dr. Tara Chu?

31:15.893 --> 31:17.059
She left us a clue.

31:17.128 --> 31:18.405
Whatever Noelani
is wrapped up in,

31:18.429 --> 31:19.807
this Dr. Chu must be
involved somehow.

31:19.831 --> 31:21.842
Yeah, well, I looked into her.
She's an accomplished

31:21.866 --> 31:22.999
cardiothoracic surgeon.

31:23.067 --> 31:24.934
Well, that lines
right up with Noelani

31:25.003 --> 31:26.213
digging around
in this guy's chest.

31:26.237 --> 31:28.938
She also taught at
Oahu State's med school.

31:29.007 --> 31:31.409
That's where Noelani
did her training, right?

31:31.433 --> 31:32.409
Mm-hmm.

31:32.410 --> 31:33.730
We got to track down
this Dr. Chu.

31:33.778 --> 31:35.055
Yeah, I tried to
call her, no answer.

31:35.079 --> 31:37.199
All right, Jerry, let's see
if we can trace her phone.

31:37.587 --> 31:40.182
All right, I've finished
the subxiphoid incision.

31:40.383 --> 31:41.816
Good.

31:41.885 --> 31:44.685
Now use the Allis clamp...

31:44.754 --> 31:47.688
to grasp the pericardium.

31:47.757 --> 31:51.159
The pericardium window
should be clear.

31:51.227 --> 31:54.061
Do you see the excess buildup?

31:54.130 --> 31:57.165
Yeah, you were right.
It's cardiac tamponade.

31:57.233 --> 31:59.433
- If my father dies...
-Yeah, yeah.

31:59.502 --> 32:01.269
I heard you the first
dozen times.

32:01.337 --> 32:02.414
But you should have
thought of that

32:02.438 --> 32:03.582
before you shot the one person

32:03.606 --> 32:04.926
that knows how
to do this surgery.

32:04.974 --> 32:06.874
I'm just following
her instructions.

32:07.279 --> 32:09.519
Now, put pressure on her wound,
'cause if she bleeds out,

32:09.646 --> 32:12.246
she's not the only one
that dies here.

32:19.889 --> 32:20.988
Time to puncture

32:21.057 --> 32:22.256
the pericardium.

32:23.626 --> 32:26.627
Firmly grasp
the aspirating needle.

32:31.401 --> 32:32.533
Noelani...

32:34.370 --> 32:36.437
...you've got this.

32:46.516 --> 32:47.648
Five-O.
Show me your hands.

33:03.833 --> 33:06.067
Noelani, you okay?

33:06.135 --> 33:09.604
Yeah. But she's gonna need help.

33:09.672 --> 33:10.783
We got a medic outside.

33:10.807 --> 33:12.306
How about him?

33:13.743 --> 33:16.544
It's okay.
I got this.

33:29.559 --> 33:31.259
Yo, I'm out.

33:31.327 --> 33:33.261
Wait, wait, not so fast.

33:33.329 --> 33:35.162
What do you got?

33:36.399 --> 33:38.532
Here you go.

33:41.137 --> 33:42.536
Wow.

33:44.974 --> 33:46.807
Um, it's amazing.

33:46.876 --> 33:49.110
Thank you.
You even framed it for me.

33:49.178 --> 33:50.444
What's wrong?

33:50.513 --> 33:52.113
Hmm?

33:52.181 --> 33:54.749
That reaction was, like,
a six out of ten at best.

33:54.817 --> 33:55.817
What's going on?

33:55.852 --> 33:59.186
Um... it's nothing.

33:59.255 --> 34:01.489
James, are we really
gonna do this?

34:01.557 --> 34:03.991
You're gonna tell me five times
that everything's fine,

34:04.060 --> 34:05.204
and then finally
come out with it?

34:08.130 --> 34:10.697
Okay.

34:10.766 --> 34:13.266
I just got a call.

34:13.335 --> 34:15.036
The drunk driver
who killed my sister--

34:15.103 --> 34:18.505
um, turns out he's up
for early parole.

34:19.708 --> 34:21.108
Hearing's in a few weeks.

34:21.177 --> 34:22.810
Are you okay?

34:22.879 --> 34:24.779
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

34:24.847 --> 34:26.981
Yeah, but it's...

34:27.050 --> 34:29.382
it's not me I'm worried about.

34:29.452 --> 34:32.687
He's been doing so well.
You know, it's taken him years

34:32.755 --> 34:35.067
to get to this point where
we can even mention Maya's name.

34:35.091 --> 34:38.458
And I'm just afraid
this might set him back.

35:06.255 --> 35:09.223
I believe you were there
the day that was taken.

35:11.294 --> 35:12.360
I believe you're right.

35:15.098 --> 35:16.418
I understand
you have news for me.

35:17.667 --> 35:19.066
I do.

35:19.135 --> 35:21.802
We found the man who murdered
your daughter's fiancé.

35:21.871 --> 35:22.526
And?

35:22.689 --> 35:24.550
Someone else got
to him first.

35:25.641 --> 35:28.209
He'd been executed.

35:28.277 --> 35:30.378
We managed to
retrieve the casing,

35:30.446 --> 35:32.413
but it traced back
to an unlicensed weapon.

35:34.751 --> 35:38.219
You know, you don't seem very
surprised by any of this.

35:38.287 --> 35:41.155
It's hardly surprising when
a man's deeds catch up to him.

35:42.692 --> 35:45.092
Do you really think he
deserved something different?

35:45.161 --> 35:48.262
No, he deserved to be
held accountable.

35:48.331 --> 35:50.564
I just think you and I
have a very different idea

35:50.633 --> 35:52.133
of what that means.

35:52.201 --> 35:53.534
Perhaps.

35:54.871 --> 35:57.638
It's been a long day,
Mr. Noshimuri.

35:57.707 --> 36:00.241
Is there anything else?

36:00.309 --> 36:02.476
Oh, yeah.

36:02.545 --> 36:03.644
Just this.

36:05.982 --> 36:08.449
We will track down your
source inside the FBI.

36:08.518 --> 36:11.819
And when they start naming names
in an effort to save themselves,

36:11.888 --> 36:14.355
we'll be back here
to arrest you.

36:15.458 --> 36:18.092
I have no doubt you'll be back.

36:18.161 --> 36:20.361
But not to arrest me.

36:20.430 --> 36:21.529
You see...

36:21.597 --> 36:23.597
I know you, Mr. Noshimuri.

36:24.834 --> 36:26.567
Where you come from.

36:26.636 --> 36:28.702
What you've done.

36:28.771 --> 36:32.206
You can fool others
by carrying that badge, but...

36:33.609 --> 36:36.644
...you can only fool yourself
for so long.

36:39.115 --> 36:40.714
One day...

36:40.783 --> 36:43.050
you will accept who you are,

36:43.119 --> 36:45.553
and who you'll always be.

36:46.656 --> 36:48.255
And on that day...

36:50.393 --> 36:52.927
...this drink will be
waiting for you.

37:35.238 --> 37:37.671
I'm, uh, really sorry
she didn't make it.

37:40.176 --> 37:42.109
I know it's a small
comfort, Noelani,

37:42.178 --> 37:45.679
but the guy that you saved
was a big-time arms smuggler.

37:45.748 --> 37:47.915
And now, thanks to you,
he's gonna be around

37:47.984 --> 37:50.217
to serve a nice, long sentence.

37:50.286 --> 37:52.119
And, with any luck,
he's gonna help us

37:52.188 --> 37:53.828
take down a bunch of people
just like him.

37:59.662 --> 38:01.595
You think
you know someone, and...

38:02.565 --> 38:04.498
Sorry, I-I shouldn't be here.

38:27.823 --> 38:30.591
Noelani, I can, uh,
I can-I can come back later.

38:34.096 --> 38:35.296
You know, for
the longest time,

38:35.364 --> 38:37.631
all I wanted to be
was a surgeon.

38:37.700 --> 38:40.868
I just didn't
know what kind.

38:43.406 --> 38:46.006
Then I met Dr. Chu
and it all became clear.

38:49.645 --> 38:51.946
She was everything
I ever wanted to be.

38:54.450 --> 38:56.317
Until she wasn't.

38:58.754 --> 39:01.121
Well, what changed?

39:01.190 --> 39:03.924
Dr. Chu was an
incredible surgeon.

39:05.861 --> 39:07.328
But she wasn't God.

39:07.396 --> 39:10.164
You know, people put
their lives in her hands,

39:10.233 --> 39:13.934
and sometimes she had to
watch them die on the table.

39:16.105 --> 39:17.916
You have to wall off
a certain part of yourself

39:17.940 --> 39:20.941
to be able to survive
something like that.

39:21.010 --> 39:24.445
Stop feeling the feelings that
people are supposed to feel.

39:30.753 --> 39:33.887
It was a sacrifice
I wasn't prepared to make.

39:33.956 --> 39:37.524
Well, I can certainly
understand that.

39:37.593 --> 39:39.426
Yeah, well, my
parents couldn't.

39:43.666 --> 39:44.898
They thought
I was crazy to get

39:44.967 --> 39:48.235
so close to surgical residency,
only to walk away

39:48.304 --> 39:50.504
and start all over again.

39:53.409 --> 39:56.410
But it wasn't them that I was
worried about disappointing.

39:56.479 --> 39:58.912
It was Dr. Chu.

40:00.716 --> 40:03.550
She was so understanding.

40:03.619 --> 40:06.420
Told me to trust my instincts.

40:06.489 --> 40:08.222
She even wrote the letter
of recommendation

40:08.291 --> 40:11.025
that got me into the forensic
pathology fellowship.

40:13.229 --> 40:15.629
Regardless of whatever
mistakes she made...

40:19.235 --> 40:21.068
...she was the one person
that supported me

40:21.137 --> 40:23.070
when I needed it the most.

40:29.578 --> 40:31.712
But when she needed me...

40:35.351 --> 40:37.051
...I couldn't save her.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.722
You know something,
I was, uh...

40:41.791 --> 40:43.824
I was in exactly
the same place you are

40:43.893 --> 40:45.225
not so long ago.

40:46.862 --> 40:49.963
Trying...
to figure out

40:50.032 --> 40:52.299
how to handle losing

40:52.368 --> 40:54.768
somebody incredibly
important to me.

41:00.209 --> 41:03.477
And, Noelani,
there is a lot of questions

41:03.546 --> 41:06.213
we will never get answers to.

41:06.282 --> 41:07.848
That's just how it is, but...

41:09.885 --> 41:12.353
...I made peace with something.

41:16.759 --> 41:18.625
I could never have saved Joe.

41:20.563 --> 41:24.031
Just like you could
never have saved her.

41:25.501 --> 41:26.834
You know that, right?

41:30.973 --> 41:32.172
Yeah.

41:32.241 --> 41:34.375
Okay.

41:38.247 --> 41:40.681
But it doesn't
make it hurt any less.

41:41.784 --> 41:43.283
No, it doesn't.

41:48.157 --> 41:50.090
No, it doesn't.
