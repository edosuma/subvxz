WEBVTT

00:47.255 --> 00:48.214
Do it!

00:51.592 --> 00:52.760
You got him! You got him!

01:07.441 --> 01:10.194
<i>I only ever met one man
I wouldn't wanna fight.</i>

01:10.319 --> 01:11.946
I can't stop that.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.906
Get out of here, you useless tit.

01:14.115 --> 01:17.076
<i>When I met him, he was already the best
cut man in the business.</i>

01:17.243 --> 01:18.411
Can you stop it?

01:18.619 --> 01:21.914
<i>Started training and managing
in the '60s, but he never lost his gift.</i>

01:22.206 --> 01:23.708
No.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.134
Let me have a look at him.

01:33.509 --> 01:34.969
He's fine. He's fine.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.471
He ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.

01:37.805 --> 01:39.223
I'll give you one more round.

01:40.975 --> 01:44.270
-Seconds out. Let's go.
-What do we do? Tell me what to do.

01:45.229 --> 01:46.480
You let him hit you.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.778
<i>Sometimes there's just
nothing you can do.</i>

01:52.945 --> 01:56.115
<i>Cut's too wide, too close to the bone.</i>

01:56.866 --> 01:58.868
<i>Maybe you got a severed vein...</i>

01:59.076 --> 02:01.746
<i>...or you just can't get the coagulant
deep enough.</i>

02:02.872 --> 02:04.332
-Come on!
-Break. Break.

02:04.498 --> 02:07.210
<i>There are all kinds of combinations
you come up against...</i>

02:07.376 --> 02:09.587
<i>...down in the different layers of meat...</i>

02:09.754 --> 02:11.672
<i>...and Frankie knew
how to work every one.</i>

02:21.641 --> 02:23.518
-That's it! Come on!
-What are you doing?

02:28.856 --> 02:29.857
Knock him out, Willie!

02:38.616 --> 02:40.326
<i>People love violence.</i>

02:41.244 --> 02:43.913
<i>They'll slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.</i>

02:44.080 --> 02:46.332
<i>Same people claim to love boxing.</i>

02:46.499 --> 02:48.876
<i>They got no idea what it is.</i>

02:49.377 --> 02:51.504
<i>Boxing is about respect.</i>

02:52.088 --> 02:53.506
<i>Getting it for yourself...</i>

02:54.215 --> 02:57.051
<i>...and taking it away from the other guy.</i>

03:00.972 --> 03:02.431
I'll warm up the car.

03:02.557 --> 03:03.975
Mr. Dunn?

03:04.851 --> 03:06.143
I owe you money?

03:06.352 --> 03:07.603
No, sir.

03:07.728 --> 03:09.272
I know your mama?

03:09.522 --> 03:11.566
Don't rightly know, sir.

03:11.732 --> 03:14.193
-Then what is it you want?
-I was on the undercard.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.946
I won my fight too. Maggie Fitzgerald.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.740
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

03:20.199 --> 03:22.201
-Did you happen to see it?
-Nope.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.870
I did pretty good.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.497
Thought you might be interested
in training me.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.374
I don't train girls.

03:28.583 --> 03:32.044
Maybe you should. People see me fight
say I'm pretty tough.

03:32.753 --> 03:36.132
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.147
It's a mistake.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.446
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.073
Just push, will you?

04:01.866 --> 04:04.911
-What did Hogan want?
-Offered us a title shot.

04:05.661 --> 04:06.913
About time.

04:07.121 --> 04:09.081
I turned him down flat.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.710
Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

04:16.672 --> 04:20.134
Been two or three more fights
for a long time now, Frankie.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.762
Look, Willie,
you get one shot at the title.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.931
You lose it,
it may not come around again.

04:25.556 --> 04:28.935
Now, two or three more fights
and we'll be ready.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.729
Whatever you say, Frankie.

04:33.189 --> 04:36.734
<i>Frankie liked to say that boxing
is an unnatural act...</i>

04:37.109 --> 04:39.987
<i>...that everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

04:41.656 --> 04:43.282
<i>Sometimes...</i>

04:43.491 --> 04:47.119
<i>...best way to deliver a punch
is step back.</i>

04:55.879 --> 04:58.632
Well, do your best, Lord...

04:59.132 --> 05:00.968
...protect Katy.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.679
Annie too.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.098
Other than that...

05:06.515 --> 05:10.227
...you know what I want,
there's no use me repeating myself.

05:10.727 --> 05:15.274
<i>But step back too far,
you ain't fighting at all.</i>

05:31.415 --> 05:33.876
-Bye.
-Bye.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.671
Father, that was a great sermon.
Made me weep.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.339
What's confusing you this week?

05:39.506 --> 05:41.925
Oh, it's the same old
one-God-three-God thing.

05:42.092 --> 05:45.387
Frankie, most people figure out
by kindergarten it's about faith.

05:45.554 --> 05:50.017
Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop
all rolled up in one big box?

05:50.767 --> 05:54.354
You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

05:55.063 --> 05:57.316
The only reason you come to Mass
is to wind me up.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.526
-It won't happen this morning.
-I'm confused.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.028
-No, you aren't.
-Yes, I am.

06:01.195 --> 06:04.364
Then here's your answer:
There's one God.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.074
Anything else? Because I'm busy.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.077
-What about the Holy Ghost?
-He's an expression of God's love.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.788
-And Jesus?
-Son of God. Don't play stupid.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.333
What is he then?
Does that make him a demigod?

06:14.500 --> 06:16.877
There are no demigods,
you fucking pagan!

06:23.300 --> 06:25.260
-Did you write your daughter?
-Absolutely.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.929
Now you're lying to a priest.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.682
You know what? Take a day off,
don't come to Mass tomorrow.

06:40.859 --> 06:45.239
<i>Some people would say the most important
thing a fighter can have is heart.</i>

06:45.906 --> 06:49.243
<i>Frankie would say, "Show me a fighter
who's nothing but heart...</i>

06:49.409 --> 06:52.579
<i>...and I'll show you a man
waiting for a beating. "</i>

07:00.629 --> 07:04.341
<i>Think I only ever met one fighter
who was all heart.</i>

07:05.717 --> 07:09.263
My name's Dangerous Dillard
Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch...

07:09.388 --> 07:11.306
...out of Broward County, Texas!

07:13.725 --> 07:16.812
<i>Danger showed up
a couple of years back.</i>

07:18.230 --> 07:22.693
<i>He'd come visiting L.A. with Ervel,
his mama's new boyfriend.</i>

07:23.360 --> 07:28.156
<i>Apparently Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.</i>

07:28.949 --> 07:32.911
<i>Danger looked for him for about a week
before he introduced himself.</i>

07:35.122 --> 07:39.835
Hey, you know, I gots nothing
against niggers.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.255
Well, that's nice to hear.

07:44.089 --> 07:48.051
Yeah, lots of people where
I comes from does...

07:48.177 --> 07:51.805
...but my mama taught me
not to cause hurt to no man...

07:52.014 --> 07:53.640
...niggers or not.

07:53.849 --> 07:56.435
You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?

07:56.643 --> 07:58.896
<i>Just one of those questions you ask...</i>

07:59.104 --> 08:01.273
<i>...but Danger wanted to give it
his best answer.</i>

08:01.440 --> 08:05.485
Well, sir, I'd likes to become
the welterweight champion of the world.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.616
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra...

08:10.782 --> 08:12.534
...Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

08:12.659 --> 08:16.747
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world!

08:16.914 --> 08:19.583
Yo, Flip, shut up, man!
You ain't even ranked.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.586
You gotta have at least one fight
to be ranked.

08:22.753 --> 08:25.047
Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!

08:25.506 --> 08:27.174
Hey, you a bad man, huh?

08:27.341 --> 08:29.343
Get in the ring. Go a round with me.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.346
-Shawrelle.
-I will.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.806
Leave him alone.

08:35.766 --> 08:38.227
Danger, you go on back to training.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.146
Will do, Mr. Scrap.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.693
Them's some nice tights, Danger.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.905
I'll give you that ass-whupping later,
Olive Oyl.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.407
Hey, bro, those pants look
real pretty on you.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.243
Give his mama back her tights.

08:54.451 --> 08:58.247
<i>Shawrelle Berry had a left hook
that would move a tank...</i>

08:58.580 --> 09:01.458
<i>...but he had a heart
the size of a split pea.</i>

09:01.834 --> 09:05.796
<i>Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.</i>

09:05.963 --> 09:09.258
<i>Bobby wanted to move to Florida,
and Frankie wanted some security.</i>

09:09.800 --> 09:12.010
<i>Bobby died while he was packing.</i>

09:12.803 --> 09:16.598
<i>And Frankie found out
most gyms lose money.</i>

09:16.807 --> 09:19.893
I thought I told you I didn't want
Danger working out here anymore.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.603
He ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.

09:22.271 --> 09:23.647
Well, he's hurting me.

09:23.856 --> 09:28.026
Breaking my heart, watching him punch
the air like he thinks it's gonna punch back.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.655
And how many times have I gotta tell you
that bleach is bleach?

09:31.864 --> 09:35.409
Why can't you buy the cheap stuff?
You don't have to buy the expensive stuff.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.411
It smells better, Frankie.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.163
Bleach smells like bleach.

09:49.464 --> 09:52.384
-Hey, Scrap.
-Hey, Mr. Willie.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.680
Hey, nice fight last night.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.811
Nice fight.

10:06.148 --> 10:07.816
-Big Willie.
-Hey, Sally.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.529
-Nice fight.
-Thanks, man.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.364
People are talking.

10:30.506 --> 10:33.091
What the hell kind of language is that?

10:33.592 --> 10:35.010
What do you want?

10:35.469 --> 10:38.514
I thought you might like to know
you got a fighter out there...

10:38.639 --> 10:40.349
...not talking to another manager.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.894
Not talking to another manager?

10:44.061 --> 10:45.687
And not just any manager.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.524
Mickey Mack.

10:49.900 --> 10:54.655
You came in here to tell me that Big Willie
is not talking to Mickey Mack.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.199
Not a word. Neither one of them.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.452
I'm trying to read here.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.913
Well, if you think that's more important.

11:05.249 --> 11:06.750
Who's your new girl?

11:08.210 --> 11:09.628
What?

11:20.681 --> 11:22.224
Jesus Christ.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.684
Better hurry up.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.687
She keeps hitting it like that,
she gonna break her wrists.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.906
You're wasting your time.
I told you I don't train girls.

11:38.073 --> 11:39.741
Thought you might change your mind.

11:40.325 --> 11:43.912
Dozens of trainers train girls.
You won't have any trouble finding one.

11:44.079 --> 11:46.623
Don't hardly need a dozen, boss.
You'll do fine.

11:46.790 --> 11:50.377
Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,
and don't you be calling me that.

11:50.544 --> 11:53.255
-Willie, you ready to work?
-Anytime.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.341
If I stop calling you boss,
will you train me?

11:57.217 --> 11:58.677
No.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.762
Then I might as well keep calling you it.

12:02.264 --> 12:05.100
<i>She came from southwestern Missouri...</i>

12:05.267 --> 12:09.313
<i>...the hills outside the scratch-ass
Ozark town of Theodosia...</i>

12:09.688 --> 12:14.484
<i>...set in the cedars and oak trees
somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.</i>

12:14.693 --> 12:18.780
<i>She grew up knowing one thing:
She was trash.</i>

12:32.878 --> 12:34.087
It's for my dog.

12:34.338 --> 12:39.843
<i>She'd come 1800 miles,
but Theodosia was still just over the hill.</i>

12:58.320 --> 12:59.571
Working the bag, boss.

12:59.738 --> 13:03.909
I'm not your boss.
And that bag's working you.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.883
Give her her money back.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.553
You sure?

13:23.178 --> 13:25.681
-How much did she pay?
-Six months.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.184
-Jesus Christ.
-No, I'll give it back.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.854
No, don't be a smartass now, will you?

13:31.979 --> 13:34.606
Woman thinks I'll throw away
six months' worth of dues...

13:34.815 --> 13:37.025
...just to get rid of her,
she's out of her mind.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.862
-But just don't encourage her, understand?
-Okay.

13:40.279 --> 13:43.782
And what's Danger doing out there?
What's he looking at?

13:48.745 --> 13:50.497
Looks like a bottle of water.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.958
He paid his dues?

13:53.709 --> 13:57.671
Dues? Boy can't afford pants.
Want him to pay dues?

13:58.338 --> 14:00.757
Get out of my office.

14:10.559 --> 14:11.768
Fuck me.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.441
Can't think of it as a bag.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.115
I'm not a trainer,
but I can show you this if you'd like.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.409
Appreciate any help I can get.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.915
What you wanna do is,
you wanna think of it as a man, see?

15:15.040 --> 15:16.333
And he's constantly moving.

15:16.500 --> 15:21.004
He's moving towards you, around you,
away from you. All right?

15:21.171 --> 15:25.676
Don't hit him when he's coming towards you
because he's just gonna push you back...

15:25.843 --> 15:29.221
...he's gonna smother your punches
and take your balance, right?

15:29.346 --> 15:30.889
So you watch him real carefully.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.392
Keep rotating.
That keeps your head moving.

15:33.517 --> 15:37.312
And keep one shoulder back so you're
always ready to fire a power shot.

15:37.479 --> 15:42.234
Right? Go ahead, now. Good, good.
Keep rotating, keep moving. That's it.

15:42.901 --> 15:45.612
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

15:46.655 --> 15:49.700
Come on around.
Keep moving, keep moving.

15:49.825 --> 15:51.493
-Good, good, good.
-Like that?

15:51.702 --> 15:54.079
Yeah. Give it a few shots.

15:56.165 --> 15:58.709
Tuck that chin in, now.
Tuck that chin in.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.712
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

16:02.045 --> 16:05.632
Now, you get this down,
we'll put you on the speed bag.

16:08.886 --> 16:10.596
You do have a speed bag.

16:21.690 --> 16:24.276
I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.986
All right, you go on home now.

16:26.236 --> 16:29.031
-I'll walk out with you?
-No, I am home.

16:29.239 --> 16:31.450
-Wanna see?
-Yeah.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.710
It's nice.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.757
Would it bother you
if I worked a little longer?

16:47.799 --> 16:51.261
No, just pull the door closed
when you leave.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.265
Thank you.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.200
<i>If there's magic in boxing...</i>

17:13.742 --> 17:16.954
<i>...it's the magic of fighting battles
beyond endurance...</i>

17:17.454 --> 17:22.459
<i>...beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys
and detached retinas.</i>

17:33.262 --> 17:38.392
<i>It's the magic of risking everything
for a dream that nobody sees but you.</i>

17:47.609 --> 17:50.112
Okay, okay, fellas, watch the footwork.

17:50.487 --> 17:52.155
Hey, that's it. That's it.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.199
Hands up.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.244
Jab, jab, jab.

18:11.466 --> 18:12.634
Hey, Flip.

18:13.510 --> 18:14.928
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.723
I think I found somebody you can beat.

18:20.726 --> 18:22.936
I don't fights women.

18:23.729 --> 18:26.481
Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro,
because you know why?

18:26.690 --> 18:29.276
Because she--
Like, you, you could fight to him...

18:29.443 --> 18:31.111
...and then you could kiss to him.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.946
Then you fight to him one more time.

18:33.322 --> 18:35.866
That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.452
-It's like poetry.
-You been reading and shit.

18:38.619 --> 18:41.163
-Thanks, bro.
-That's a girl, man?

18:41.413 --> 18:45.792
Flip, I think you right. Look at her little
bitty titties. They're like mosquito bites.

18:46.001 --> 18:48.629
Man, that's barely even a mouthful.
Let me see.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.422
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

18:50.589 --> 18:53.509
Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties.

18:58.222 --> 19:03.310
Canvas has titties.
Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.

19:11.527 --> 19:14.321
Just humping the canvas.
Humping the floor.

19:15.739 --> 19:19.785
Come on, bro. The floor having titties?
That's funny, bro.

19:19.910 --> 19:22.955
Shut up, man.
What you laughing at?

19:23.664 --> 19:25.833
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.377
Some titties right there, man.

19:30.128 --> 19:33.423
Yo, when they start making those tights
for men, Flippy?

19:33.590 --> 19:35.175
Punk.

19:36.385 --> 19:39.263
All right, that's enough.
That's enough for the day.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.726
-I'll give you a rubdown.
-Oh, I can't, Frankie.

19:44.893 --> 19:47.938
Middle one's got a piano lesson.
I told Grace I'd drive her.

19:48.188 --> 19:51.275
-Something wrong with Gracie's car?
-She hates that car.

19:51.441 --> 19:54.695
Wants the old one back,
but the dealer said he's already got a buyer.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.572
Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

19:57.781 --> 19:59.449
I'd appreciate that.

19:59.616 --> 20:00.909
Okay.

20:01.076 --> 20:03.871
-Thanks.
-See you later.

20:12.129 --> 20:15.090
The man's a rubdown whore.
Today he doesn't want one.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.051
You ever do any work around here?

20:18.927 --> 20:21.513
Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

20:25.142 --> 20:26.894
Little girl seems to be coming along.

20:28.270 --> 20:32.024
Yeah. It's almost like
someone's been helping her.

20:33.233 --> 20:36.945
She might just be a natural.
Looks like she's got something.

20:39.156 --> 20:42.284
She's got my speed bag,
that's what she's got.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.162
I wonder how the hell she got that.

20:45.370 --> 20:46.872
I wonder.

20:56.882 --> 20:58.884
I'm gonna need that speed bag back.

20:59.051 --> 21:01.595
-This bag?
-Yes, that bag. That's my bag.

21:01.803 --> 21:04.640
And if you're hitting it,
people will think I'm training you.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.308
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

21:06.475 --> 21:08.477
Yes. Yes, it is.

21:08.644 --> 21:11.855
Every time you touch it,
you're losing me business out here.

21:12.022 --> 21:15.275
-I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.
-Yeah.

21:15.901 --> 21:19.154
Well, I can't just lend it
to anybody, you know.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.614
I understand.

21:21.865 --> 21:22.908
Yeah.

21:25.911 --> 21:27.663
Look, you seem like a nice girl.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.791
-Can I give you some advice?
-I'd appreciate that.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.919
You'll find a trainer in this gym
or somewhere else...

21:34.086 --> 21:36.129
...that's gonna wanna train a girl.

21:36.380 --> 21:38.549
It's the latest freak show out there.

21:38.674 --> 21:41.093
The trouble is, they're gonna be
wasting your time...

21:41.260 --> 21:42.928
...because you're too old.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.639
I don't feel that old.

21:45.806 --> 21:49.309
Well, neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21 -year-olds, do you?

21:50.102 --> 21:52.980
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.232
How old are you?

21:56.024 --> 21:59.278
-Thirty-one until my next birthday.
-Oh, well, there you go.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.029
Thirty-one.

22:01.655 --> 22:04.867
You wouldn't start training to be
a ballerina at 31, would you?

22:05.075 --> 22:06.994
Already been working it
for three years.

22:07.327 --> 22:10.789
And you can't hit a speed bag?
What kind of training is that?

22:11.206 --> 22:12.833
Never had any, boss.

22:14.001 --> 22:16.295
Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

22:16.420 --> 22:18.505
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

22:18.964 --> 22:21.675
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

22:21.967 --> 22:23.510
Yeah.

22:24.303 --> 22:27.764
Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.729
-You're not gonna cry now, are you?
-No, sir.

22:34.771 --> 22:35.814
Yeah.

22:37.983 --> 22:39.526
Here.

22:41.069 --> 22:43.030
-Keep the goddamn thing.
-No, you need it.

22:43.238 --> 22:45.032
No, take the bag.

22:45.949 --> 22:48.368
I haven't seen it in 20 years anyway.

22:48.535 --> 22:52.956
I've had three since then.
Just enjoy it, will you?

22:53.123 --> 22:55.709
-I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.
-Yeah.

22:56.585 --> 22:58.337
Just don't lose it.

23:06.929 --> 23:08.472
Yeah, I know, Hogan...

23:08.639 --> 23:11.475
...your guy's the champ,
so we don't split 50s...

23:11.600 --> 23:14.311
...but if I don't see 40 percent--

23:15.145 --> 23:19.024
Look, you call me back when it's 60-40
or don't call me back at all.

23:28.742 --> 23:30.869
-Hey, Willie.
-Hey, Frankie.

23:30.994 --> 23:32.621
Something wrong?

23:32.830 --> 23:36.667
I'm sorry to come by your house like this.
I know you don't like people dropping in.

23:36.834 --> 23:40.170
Oh, you're not people, Willie.
You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

23:40.379 --> 23:43.215
I wanted to thank you
for getting Gracie's car back.

23:43.382 --> 23:45.217
Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

23:45.384 --> 23:49.596
Paying an extra thousand dollars
for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

23:49.763 --> 23:51.598
Gracie cried when she saw it.

23:51.807 --> 23:53.433
Really?

23:54.393 --> 23:56.562
I also needed to talk with you
about business.

23:56.728 --> 24:00.732
Oh, yeah, well, I just got off the phone
with Hogan. We're all set for September.

24:00.941 --> 24:02.776
Everything but the split.

24:03.527 --> 24:04.778
I gotta leave you, Frankie.

24:07.072 --> 24:08.323
What?

24:11.827 --> 24:14.997
Willie, the title's just two fights away.

24:15.164 --> 24:19.418
It ain't that, it's--
It's like you said, I got one shot.

24:20.002 --> 24:22.546
If I win, I gotta make
as much as I can while I can.

24:23.297 --> 24:26.466
I need somebody in the action
who can make things happen.

24:27.426 --> 24:30.262
And I gotta make the change
before the fight.

24:30.429 --> 24:33.891
Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.

24:34.433 --> 24:37.936
So I get you the title fight,
and this guy takes you there?

24:38.103 --> 24:39.313
Only way he'd do it.

24:40.272 --> 24:44.026
I'm sorry, Frankie. I know how long
you waiting on a title.

24:44.234 --> 24:45.694
I wish it could've been with me.

24:47.529 --> 24:51.492
Mickey Mack's a businessman.
He can't teach you nothing.

24:52.326 --> 24:54.536
You already taught me
everything I need to know.

25:03.128 --> 25:06.048
<i>There's some things people
just don't want to hear.</i>

25:16.975 --> 25:21.688
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

25:21.897 --> 25:26.193
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world.

25:26.318 --> 25:29.071
Danger, I'm wearing
these mitts for a reason.

25:30.322 --> 25:33.242
Just working on my footwork, Mr. Scrap.

25:33.992 --> 25:37.913
Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out of this gym.

25:42.334 --> 25:45.754
Danger, while you thinking about
that punch, I'll be right back.

25:47.089 --> 25:51.176
I'm thinking how I'm gonna hit it hard
for you, Mr. Scrap.

25:56.181 --> 26:02.396
<i>No one had the heart to tell Danger
that Hearns retired years ago.</i>

26:09.736 --> 26:11.780
I heard about Willie.

26:12.197 --> 26:15.159
That's cold. That's dead cold.

26:15.284 --> 26:18.287
Of course, it wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.

26:18.453 --> 26:21.373
Yeah, well, at least I can see
through both eyes.

26:22.124 --> 26:24.084
Didn't do you
a lot of good though, did it?

26:25.460 --> 26:27.296
Well, I've got the gym.

26:27.462 --> 26:30.841
Don't need to be training fighters
at my age.

26:31.967 --> 26:33.510
Willie tell you why?

26:33.677 --> 26:36.597
It was Mickey.
Mickey's got the connections.

26:36.763 --> 26:40.100
Oh, it ain't about connections.
It's about you not believing in him.

26:40.309 --> 26:42.936
Well, I found him,
I stuck with him for eight years.

26:43.145 --> 26:45.105
How's that for not believing in him?

26:45.272 --> 26:48.692
You could've got him a title fight
two years ago. Hell, he knew that.

26:48.817 --> 26:50.944
I'm amazed he stayed around this long.

26:51.111 --> 26:54.364
Well, getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.

26:54.531 --> 26:57.451
What was I supposed to do,
just put him in over his head?

26:57.659 --> 26:58.994
Not protect him?

26:59.119 --> 27:01.497
Oh, you were protecting him
from the championship.

27:01.705 --> 27:05.167
-Yeah.
-Well, now it makes sense.

27:05.334 --> 27:08.962
Well, what about you, Scrap?
What did your manager do?

27:09.129 --> 27:11.298
You were a hell of a fighter,
better than Willie.

27:11.965 --> 27:14.801
He get you a title fight,
or did he just bust you out...

27:15.010 --> 27:18.430
...banging your head against other
people's fists until you lost your eye?

27:18.931 --> 27:20.724
I had my shot.

27:20.891 --> 27:23.519
I went out swinging,
and no man can say I didn't.

27:23.685 --> 27:24.895
Yeah, well, I remember.

27:25.062 --> 27:28.815
And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter
spending the second half of his life...

27:29.024 --> 27:32.194
-...cleaning up other people's spit.
-Yeah, right.

27:32.986 --> 27:36.532
Right, you're the smart one.
You're the one learning Greek.

27:37.533 --> 27:38.742
It's Gaelic.

27:38.867 --> 27:41.995
Well, you just protected yourself
out of a championship fight.

27:42.204 --> 27:44.998
How do you say that in Gaelic?

28:52.608 --> 28:54.526
Sorry.

29:01.658 --> 29:03.160
Thanks.

29:03.452 --> 29:07.581
<i>The action continues as the champ
is battling Big Willie Jones...</i>

29:07.706 --> 29:09.708
<i>...and commanding him
with rights and lefts.</i>

29:09.875 --> 29:12.586
<i>Up against the ropes,
he's hitting him with the left....</i>

29:13.337 --> 29:16.215
<i>Boxing is an unnatural act.</i>

29:16.882 --> 29:19.760
<i>Because everything in it is backwards.</i>

29:21.803 --> 29:23.639
<i>You wanna move to the left...</i>

29:23.847 --> 29:27.142
<i>...you don't step left,
you push on the right toe.</i>

29:28.310 --> 29:31.855
<i>To move right, you use your left toe.</i>

29:32.022 --> 29:35.984
<i>Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do...</i>

29:36.151 --> 29:37.569
<i>...you step into it.</i>

29:38.946 --> 29:43.116
<i>But Big Willie comes back. Oh, my God,
he hits the champ with a right hand.</i>

29:43.283 --> 29:45.661
<i>And the champ is down.</i>

29:45.828 --> 29:48.163
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
the ref is in for the count.</i>

29:48.372 --> 29:51.667
<i>And Big Willie Jones
is the new champion of the world.</i>

29:51.834 --> 29:55.504
<i>It's unbelievable how
this has taken place tonight...</i>

29:55.671 --> 29:58.966
<i>...but there you have it, folks,
a new champion.</i>

30:00.551 --> 30:03.679
<i>Everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

30:18.944 --> 30:20.654
Want a cheeseburger?

30:20.821 --> 30:22.573
-You bought me a cheeseburger?
-Yeah.

30:22.781 --> 30:24.825
I never see you buy anybody
a cheeseburger.

30:24.992 --> 30:28.036
Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.
You want it?

30:28.162 --> 30:31.248
Well, I guess the planet
can go back to spinning.

30:32.541 --> 30:36.378
-You watch the fight?
-Yeah, I watched it.

30:36.712 --> 30:38.839
Willie did good.

30:39.923 --> 30:41.550
That's what you've got to say?

30:41.717 --> 30:44.386
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

30:45.387 --> 30:49.725
I see you been working on yourself,
learning to open up. That's good work.

30:49.892 --> 30:51.643
You watch it?

30:51.894 --> 30:54.021
Yeah, I got HBO.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.316
Now, how can you afford HBO?

30:57.524 --> 31:01.320
How long have I been telling you
to save your money?

31:01.528 --> 31:03.989
Ever since I fought
Louis "Typhoon" Johnson...

31:04.198 --> 31:06.366
...at the Stadium Club
in Tupelo, Mississippi.

31:07.242 --> 31:09.244
-That true?
-Yeah.

31:09.411 --> 31:13.081
Manager ran off
and left you and me to hitch home.

31:13.248 --> 31:14.541
Don't you remember nothing?

31:14.791 --> 31:19.171
Well, I remember walking halfway
and thinking I was gonna be lynched.

31:19.379 --> 31:23.258
I remember you leaving me with my dick
in my hand behind that gas station.

31:23.425 --> 31:26.887
Yeah, well, I got a ride. The guy took off
before I hardly closed the door.

31:27.137 --> 31:29.556
I had to walk back two miles.

31:29.765 --> 31:32.893
Your conscience got the better of you,
that's what.

31:36.313 --> 31:38.273
What the hell's that?

31:38.607 --> 31:40.776
It's her birthday.

32:02.631 --> 32:06.134
You're not breathing right.
That's why you're panting.

32:07.052 --> 32:09.179
So it's your birthday, huh?

32:09.304 --> 32:11.557
How old does that make you?

32:12.057 --> 32:14.601
I'm 32, Mr. Dunn.

32:14.810 --> 32:18.355
I'm celebrating that I spent another year
scraping dishes and waitressing...

32:18.522 --> 32:20.482
...which is what I been doing since 13.

32:20.691 --> 32:25.696
And according to you, I'll be 37
before I can even throw a decent punch...

32:25.863 --> 32:28.615
...which after working this speed bag
for a month and getting nowhere...

32:28.782 --> 32:30.951
...I now realize may be God's simple truth.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.328
Other truth is, my brother's in prison...

32:33.495 --> 32:37.040
...my sister cheats on welfare by pretending
one of her kids is still alive...

32:37.207 --> 32:39.793
...my daddy's dead,
and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

32:40.544 --> 32:43.255
If I was thinking straight,
I'd go back home...

32:43.422 --> 32:47.885
...find a used trailer,
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

32:48.302 --> 32:51.805
The problem is, this is the only thing
I ever felt good doing.

32:52.014 --> 32:55.017
If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing.

32:55.934 --> 32:57.644
That enough truth to suit you?

32:59.855 --> 33:01.148
This your speed bag?

33:01.273 --> 33:04.276
Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.

33:06.612 --> 33:09.781
Okay, just hold it. Hold it.

33:09.948 --> 33:13.118
I'll show you a few things,
and then we'll get you a trainer.

33:13.285 --> 33:14.870
No, sorry.

33:15.037 --> 33:17.539
-You're in a position to negotiate?
-Yes, sir.

33:17.706 --> 33:21.668
Because I know if you train me right,
I'm gonna be a champ.

33:23.337 --> 33:24.963
I seen you looking at me.

33:25.130 --> 33:28.050
-Yeah, out of pity.
-Don't you say that.

33:28.217 --> 33:31.094
Don't you say that if it ain't true.

33:31.762 --> 33:33.013
I want a trainer.

33:33.764 --> 33:37.059
I don't want charity,
and I don't want favors.

33:41.355 --> 33:44.525
If you're not interested,
then I got more celebrating to do.

33:46.944 --> 33:49.071
Stop, stop, stop.

33:49.196 --> 33:53.242
Goddamn it, stop.
What the hell are you doing?

33:56.954 --> 33:58.580
Okay.

33:58.914 --> 34:00.374
If I'm gonna take you on--

34:00.499 --> 34:04.002
-You won't never regret it.
-Look, just listen to me.

34:04.211 --> 34:07.005
-lf I take you on--
-I promise I'll work so hard.

34:07.214 --> 34:09.550
God, this is a mistake already.

34:11.593 --> 34:13.178
I'm listening, boss.

34:14.096 --> 34:18.600
If I take you on, you don't say anything,
you don't question me.

34:19.059 --> 34:22.813
You don't ask why, you don't say
anything except maybe, "Yes, Frankie."

34:23.188 --> 34:26.066
And I'm gonna try to forget the fact
that you're a girl.

34:26.233 --> 34:27.442
That's all I ask.

34:27.651 --> 34:30.112
And don't come crying to me
if you get hurt.

34:30.904 --> 34:32.906
-Alrighty.
-We got a deal.

34:33.323 --> 34:35.242
No, not quite.

34:35.409 --> 34:37.369
I'm gonna teach you how to fight...

34:37.536 --> 34:40.247
...then we'll get you a manager,
and I'm off down the road.

34:40.414 --> 34:44.042
-I hate to argue with you, but--
-Don't argue, that's the way we're doing it.

34:44.209 --> 34:47.921
I teach you all you need to know,
and you go off and make a million dollars.

34:48.172 --> 34:51.091
I don't care. You get your teeth
knocked out, I don't care.

34:51.258 --> 34:54.469
I don't wanna hear about it.
That's just the way it's gonna be.

34:54.595 --> 34:56.180
It's the only way I'll do it.

35:04.438 --> 35:05.606
All right.

35:06.690 --> 35:11.695
Now, one of the things I've noticed around
the gym is you never move your feet.

35:11.820 --> 35:15.115
You stand there just flat-footed.
You've gotta move your feet.

35:15.324 --> 35:17.451
That's one of the best things
I can teach you.

35:17.701 --> 35:20.454
So here's what you do.

35:20.746 --> 35:23.123
You get yourself--
Bend your knees a little bit.

35:23.624 --> 35:27.169
Get in an athletic position.
Look like you're gonna hit something.

35:29.505 --> 35:32.424
-Move them how, boss?
-Just-- Go-- Hit the bag.

35:34.301 --> 35:36.136
-Stop.
-What'd I do wrong?

35:36.303 --> 35:38.430
Okay, you did two things wrong.

35:38.597 --> 35:41.934
One is you asked a question,
and two is you asked another question.

35:42.434 --> 35:46.313
Now, what I want you to do,
it's not about hitting it hard...

35:46.480 --> 35:50.400
...it's how good you hit it. So watch me.

35:50.567 --> 35:52.152
You can count with me if you want.

35:52.402 --> 35:55.155
It's just count. On a one-count,
I hit right through the bag.

35:55.405 --> 35:57.366
-Can you show me that again?
-I just--

35:57.574 --> 35:59.576
Just say "one," please.

35:59.743 --> 36:01.203
-One.
-Okay.

36:01.370 --> 36:03.205
-One. Okay.
-One.

36:03.372 --> 36:06.500
Yeah, just say "one." That's good.
That's good.

36:06.750 --> 36:11.338
Then I move over to my right foot. You'll
see my weight is shifting to my right foot.

36:11.839 --> 36:16.760
Then I hit it with my back of my hand, sort
of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

36:16.927 --> 36:22.266
Then I come over, and I shift to my left foot,
and I hit it with my right hand.

36:22.432 --> 36:25.060
And ice pick maneuver again.

36:25.227 --> 36:28.272
And I come over on my right foot
and hit it right.

36:29.815 --> 36:32.526
Don't watch anything but my feet.

36:43.996 --> 36:47.541
Just do it like that. Just keep practicing.

37:17.613 --> 37:21.408
<i>You show them how to stand,
keep their legs under their shoulders.</i>

37:29.833 --> 37:33.545
<i>To make a fighter,
you gotta strip them down to bare wood.</i>

37:33.670 --> 37:35.172
Rest when you're dead.

37:35.380 --> 37:37.007
Come here.

37:41.553 --> 37:44.181
<i>You can't just tell them
to forget everything you know...</i>

37:44.348 --> 37:47.392
<i>...you gotta make them forget it
in their bones.</i>

37:51.438 --> 37:53.815
<i>Make them so tired
they only listen to you.</i>

37:53.982 --> 37:58.028
<i>Only hear your voice,
only do what you say, and nothing else.</i>

37:58.153 --> 37:59.404
Move your feet.

37:59.571 --> 38:01.573
Move your feet around. Let's see you go.

38:16.380 --> 38:19.800
<i>Show them how to keep their balance
and take it away from the other guy.</i>

38:20.008 --> 38:23.720
Not so low. Look at me.
Right hook and just turn right.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.811
<i>How to generate momentum
off your right toe.</i>

38:32.563 --> 38:35.315
<i>And how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.</i>

38:41.655 --> 38:45.909
<i>How to fight backing up, so that the
other guy doesn't wanna come after you.</i>

38:46.451 --> 38:48.662
<i>Then you gotta show them
all over again.</i>

38:48.912 --> 38:51.081
<i>Over and over and over...</i>

38:51.206 --> 38:54.209
<i>...till they think they were born that way.</i>

38:56.003 --> 38:57.254
Shift.

38:57.379 --> 38:59.339
Shift away.

39:00.340 --> 39:03.510
Okay. That's enough for today.

39:03.677 --> 39:07.139
Good work. Good girl.

39:08.432 --> 39:11.059
You think I ready for a fight, boss?

39:33.582 --> 39:37.085
Hey. Hey, come here.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.089
You're not breathing.

39:42.716 --> 39:44.426
Hate to disagree with you.

39:45.093 --> 39:47.888
Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.

39:48.096 --> 39:51.475
-Now, stop doing that.
-Okay.

39:51.642 --> 39:53.936
But other than that,
I'm doing pretty good, right?

39:54.478 --> 39:58.023
-I mean, for a girl.
-I don't train girls.

40:00.817 --> 40:02.986
Think I might be ready
for a fight, boss?

40:03.153 --> 40:06.698
Well, we'll get a manager,
and we'll find out, won't we?

40:06.865 --> 40:09.868
I'd like to,
but you been keeping me too busy.

40:16.792 --> 40:19.586
-Got any family, boss?
-What?

40:22.130 --> 40:25.467
You been spending all this time with me,
I didn't know if you had any.

40:26.468 --> 40:27.761
No.

40:29.429 --> 40:31.765
Well, I've got a daughter, Katy.

40:32.558 --> 40:33.767
That's family.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.645
We're not exactly close.

40:37.145 --> 40:38.564
How much she weigh?

40:39.815 --> 40:41.149
What?

40:41.358 --> 40:44.486
Trouble in my family
comes by the pound.

40:46.822 --> 40:48.490
Yeah.

40:48.740 --> 40:50.826
Not very big.

40:51.118 --> 40:55.080
Used to be real athletic.
Don't know if she kept it up.

41:01.170 --> 41:04.715
So, what do you think?

41:04.840 --> 41:06.800
I ready for a fight?

41:12.514 --> 41:14.308
Hey, Sally.

41:15.976 --> 41:17.436
Come here for a minute, will you?

41:19.354 --> 41:22.149
Frankie, I need to see you
in the back for a minute, okay?

41:22.858 --> 41:26.195
-Can I see you a minute?
-Sally here's a real good manager.

41:26.361 --> 41:30.324
Has a couple of Golden Glove boys.
Looking for a girl, Sally?

41:30.491 --> 41:32.451
I'm looking for a good one.

41:32.868 --> 41:35.787
Well, see, there you go.

41:38.540 --> 41:40.375
Nice working with you, girlie.

41:44.338 --> 41:46.590
-What'd you want?
-Nothing. It's nothing.

41:46.715 --> 41:50.844
I ain't lying, I've been watching you work.
You got a hell of a left.

41:51.261 --> 41:52.679
Thank you.

41:54.598 --> 41:58.227
So you wanna give this a try?
See if it's a fit?

42:00.395 --> 42:03.565
-Yeah, sure.
-Good.

42:03.774 --> 42:06.235
Because I think you're ready for a fight.

42:18.455 --> 42:19.998
Break.

42:21.291 --> 42:24.378
What am I doing wrong, Sally?
Every time I get inside, she's on me.

42:24.503 --> 42:27.256
You're doing great.
You're wearing her down. Keep punching.

42:27.422 --> 42:30.676
-I ain't doing great, I'm losing.
-You're wearing her down.

42:32.386 --> 42:34.221
You okay, honey? Can you see okay?

42:35.681 --> 42:37.766
-Come on.
-Do it.

42:38.475 --> 42:40.519
Come on, let's do this!

42:44.648 --> 42:45.899
That's it!

42:53.574 --> 42:54.992
Nice night, eh?

42:55.367 --> 42:58.078
Jesus Christ.

42:58.245 --> 43:00.122
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

43:00.455 --> 43:02.082
Hell of a fighter.

43:02.249 --> 43:04.293
11-0.

43:04.459 --> 43:06.461
Your left. Keep your left up.

43:11.258 --> 43:13.343
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

43:13.468 --> 43:16.597
He's got Joey Adagio,
lightweight champ?

43:16.805 --> 43:18.307
Yeah.

43:18.640 --> 43:20.517
Your left, damn it.

43:21.435 --> 43:26.064
Wouldn't have been my choice for
her first fight, but Sally's a good manager.

43:26.273 --> 43:28.942
-He must think she can take her.
-Jesus H.

43:29.151 --> 43:31.778
Your left. Keep your left up.

43:32.196 --> 43:35.199
You think she can hear you
from back here?

43:42.247 --> 43:46.001
Of course, if Maggie loses,
it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

43:46.168 --> 43:48.170
Might even help him.

43:48.337 --> 43:50.255
Lonnie's girl gets another win...

43:50.422 --> 43:55.010
...Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

43:55.260 --> 43:57.596
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

43:57.763 --> 43:59.223
Hey, what do I know?

43:59.348 --> 44:02.142
I just come because I enjoy the fights.

44:02.309 --> 44:04.811
Mother of God.

44:05.687 --> 44:07.231
Okay, break.

44:07.397 --> 44:09.733
Hey. Come here, come here.

44:09.900 --> 44:11.360
Hey. Get over here.

44:11.527 --> 44:14.363
You're dropping your left hand.
Quit dropping your left hand.

44:14.530 --> 44:17.199
Hey, Frankie,
you mind if I talk to my fighter?

44:17.407 --> 44:20.786
You're doing a hell of a job.
Is this the way you advise your lightweight?

44:21.286 --> 44:22.871
Dunn.

44:23.038 --> 44:25.582
-What are you doing?
-I'm talking. What are you doing?

44:25.749 --> 44:27.668
-Is this your fighter?
-It's my fighter.

44:28.961 --> 44:31.171
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

44:31.380 --> 44:34.508
Fine, you take her.
She can't fight worth a shit anyway.

44:34.716 --> 44:39.054
-Somebody tell me what's going on.
-I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.

44:39.221 --> 44:41.682
You telling me this is your fighter?

44:43.934 --> 44:46.228
Yeah, this is my fighter.

44:46.395 --> 44:48.146
Then you got 10 seconds.

44:48.397 --> 44:51.567
I keep holding my left up,
then I throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

44:51.733 --> 44:53.819
-Well, let it drop.
-That'd be a lot easier.

44:54.027 --> 44:55.195
She thinks she knows you.

44:55.362 --> 44:58.365
Every time you drop it,
she comes right over the top.

44:58.532 --> 45:01.743
So you just wait for her, see?
That's all she's thinking about.

45:01.910 --> 45:04.913
-When she cocks that right hand-- You hear?
-I hear you, boss.

45:05.080 --> 45:08.083
When she does, step to the side
and come with a good-night hook.

45:08.250 --> 45:09.626
-Got one?
-Got it right here.

45:09.877 --> 45:12.588
-Okay.
-Fight, or I'm calling it.

45:12.754 --> 45:15.716
<i>-Go give it to her.
-The body knows what fighters don't.</i>

45:15.883 --> 45:17.092
<i>How to protect itself.</i>

45:17.801 --> 45:20.053
<i>A neck can only twist so far.</i>

45:20.262 --> 45:23.432
<i>Twist it just a hair more,
and the body says:</i>

45:23.640 --> 45:27.811
<i>"Hey, I'll take it from here because you
obviously don't know what you're doing. "</i>

45:27.978 --> 45:29.813
Neutral corner.

45:31.273 --> 45:33.150
-See the way she did that?
-Yeah.

45:33.275 --> 45:36.236
Sugar Ray would do that.
Girl's got sugar.

45:36.445 --> 45:42.117
<i>"Lie down, now, rest, and we'll talk
about this when you regain your senses. "</i>

45:42.284 --> 45:44.453
<i>It's called the knockout mechanism.</i>

45:44.620 --> 45:48.373
Don't get all carried away, now.
You did good.

45:48.499 --> 45:50.501
Thanks, boss.

45:50.834 --> 45:53.212
You.... You forgot the rule.

45:53.378 --> 45:55.756
-Now, what is the rule?
-Keep my left up?

45:55.964 --> 45:58.926
It's to protect yourself at all times.

45:59.510 --> 46:01.053
Now, what is the rule?

46:01.220 --> 46:04.598
-Protect myself at all times.
-Good, good.

46:04.765 --> 46:06.934
You gave me away.
How was that protecting me?

46:08.602 --> 46:09.811
It wasn't.

46:10.896 --> 46:12.397
It's okay.

46:13.148 --> 46:16.985
-I'll work on my left, boss.
-Drink your water.

46:18.070 --> 46:19.822
Other than that, how'd I do?

46:20.197 --> 46:23.116
Fine. You did fine.

46:24.076 --> 46:25.577
You gonna leave me again?

46:27.746 --> 46:29.414
Never.

46:29.581 --> 46:33.961
That place you work, do they have
homemade lemon meringue pie there?

46:34.503 --> 46:37.172
-Sure.
-Not the kind with the canned-filling crap?

46:37.339 --> 46:40.968
Oh, big can, yay size.
Says "homemade" on the label.

46:43.512 --> 46:46.515
-I want you to take the weekend off.
-It's only Thursday.

46:47.724 --> 46:51.395
-You gonna argue with me?
-Know better than to do that, boss.

46:51.979 --> 46:53.772
Well, good.

46:53.939 --> 46:56.650
<i>All fighters are pigheaded
some way or other.</i>

46:57.067 --> 47:00.487
<i>Some part of them always thinks
they know better than you about something.</i>

47:00.696 --> 47:04.950
Can you spare a few minutes
for the Immaculate Conception?

47:06.535 --> 47:10.372
<i>Truth is, even if they're wrong...</i>

47:10.539 --> 47:13.542
<i>...even if that one thing
is gonna be the ruin of them...</i>

47:13.709 --> 47:18.547
<i>...if you can beat that last bit out of them,
then they ain't fighters at all.</i>

47:18.714 --> 47:22.050
-Thought I said I'd see you Monday.
-You sure did, boss.

47:22.634 --> 47:23.886
That was last night.

47:24.094 --> 47:26.847
You said not to argue with you.

47:38.317 --> 47:40.986
Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

47:41.153 --> 47:43.113
You want my advice?

47:43.280 --> 47:44.740
What?

47:45.741 --> 47:47.159
Where are your shoes?

47:48.577 --> 47:50.579
I'm airing out my feet.

47:52.289 --> 47:54.166
You got big holes in your socks.

47:55.209 --> 47:57.169
Oh, they're not that big.

47:59.004 --> 48:01.215
Didn't I give you money
for some new ones?

48:02.925 --> 48:04.551
These are my sleeping socks.

48:05.969 --> 48:08.597
My feet like a little air at night.

48:09.223 --> 48:11.433
How come you're wearing them
in the daytime, then?

48:11.600 --> 48:14.603
Because my daytime socks
got too many holes in them.

48:16.897 --> 48:22.486
Well, if I give you some more money,
you buy some new socks.

48:22.778 --> 48:24.446
Please?

48:26.782 --> 48:30.661
Well, I'd be tempted,
but I couldn't say for sure.

48:30.786 --> 48:32.746
Might find its way to the track.

48:49.263 --> 48:52.474
It's over. It's over.

49:07.364 --> 49:09.992
<i>Didn't take Maggie long
to hit her stride.</i>

49:21.503 --> 49:22.880
I got the breathing thing down.

49:23.046 --> 49:26.633
No, you ain't breathing because you're
knocking them out in the first round.

49:26.800 --> 49:30.304
-Thought that was the point.
-The point is to get good.

49:30.971 --> 49:33.599
Can't get good if you keep
knocking them out first round.

49:33.765 --> 49:35.976
How am I gonna get you fights?

49:37.728 --> 49:40.063
Nobody wants to see
their fighter embarrassed, now.

49:40.189 --> 49:42.858
Why am I still doing
four-rounders, boss?

49:43.358 --> 49:45.611
Because you haven't got the lungs
for six rounds.

49:45.819 --> 49:49.031
I do if I keep knocking them out
in the first round.

49:52.910 --> 49:56.205
<i>Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder...</i>

49:56.371 --> 49:58.499
<i>...just to let her know who was boss.</i>

50:02.544 --> 50:05.547
Three, four, five...

50:05.714 --> 50:07.841
...six, seven....

50:08.050 --> 50:09.635
Sorry, boss.

50:09.801 --> 50:11.845
<i>Maggie left no doubt about it.</i>

50:20.812 --> 50:24.024
All right, let's do it.

50:25.150 --> 50:29.154
<i>Her first six-rounder
didn't go quite as smooth.</i>

50:43.961 --> 50:45.712
Get up!

50:46.296 --> 50:47.548
To your corner.

50:47.756 --> 50:50.884
-Three, four, five...
-Get up.

50:51.134 --> 50:53.345
-...six, seven...
-Get up.

50:53.512 --> 50:56.557
-...eight, nine, ten. It's over.
-You can do this.

50:57.808 --> 51:02.271
<i>Maggie didn't knock her out
till the end of the first round.</i>

51:02.479 --> 51:06.608
<i>After that, no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.</i>

51:10.654 --> 51:13.740
<i>Frankie had to go into his pocket
to get her decent fights...</i>

51:13.907 --> 51:17.911
<i>...sweetening the purse
by paying managers on the side.</i>

51:29.965 --> 51:32.384
<i>That only worked for so long.</i>

51:32.551 --> 51:35.679
<i>Then Frankie did something
he hated doing.</i>

51:35.846 --> 51:36.889
<i>He took a chance.</i>

51:39.641 --> 51:41.476
Box.

51:45.772 --> 51:48.275
<i>He moved her up in class.</i>

51:48.484 --> 51:51.320
<i>That could've been a mistake.</i>

52:04.166 --> 52:05.626
Watch the right!

52:08.003 --> 52:10.130
Watch it. Watch it.

52:17.095 --> 52:20.974
Break, break. Step back. Break. Time.

52:29.525 --> 52:31.985
Damn, damn, damn.

52:34.488 --> 52:35.906
Give us two seconds, will you?

52:36.073 --> 52:37.825
-Okay.
-Just two seconds.

52:38.617 --> 52:40.828
-Your nose is broke.
-Oh, damn.

52:41.036 --> 52:42.788
-Fix it.
-I can't, I can't.

52:42.955 --> 52:45.499
-You can fix it.
-I can't. I've gotta call it.

52:45.707 --> 52:47.584
I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

52:47.918 --> 52:50.796
I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.

52:50.921 --> 52:52.506
The ring doctor's gonna call it.

52:52.673 --> 52:55.926
Please, Frankie, if you
can stop the blood, I can beat her.

52:57.344 --> 52:59.221
Bite down on this.

53:17.406 --> 53:18.866
-Inhale.
-What?

53:19.116 --> 53:20.492
-Inhale.
-What?

53:20.909 --> 53:22.619
Breathe in.

53:33.881 --> 53:36.633
-Okay, huh?
-Yeah, it's okay.

53:36.842 --> 53:39.928
All right, you got 20 seconds
before this turns into a geyser...

53:40.095 --> 53:42.222
...and it's gonna spray
all over the front row.

53:42.431 --> 53:44.641
Twenty seconds, that's all you've got.

53:44.808 --> 53:46.518
Now get going.

53:59.239 --> 54:01.116
Go to your corner.

54:02.242 --> 54:05.078
Three, four, five...

54:05.245 --> 54:08.916
-Come on, breathe. Breathe.
-...six, seven, eight...

54:09.124 --> 54:11.210
...nine, ten.

54:14.588 --> 54:16.048
<i>Mo cuishle.</i>

54:21.637 --> 54:23.388
-All right!
-Yeah!

54:25.224 --> 54:26.642
Right.

54:30.854 --> 54:32.648
What you reading?

54:33.565 --> 54:34.817
What's she saying?

54:35.359 --> 54:37.653
Wants to know what you're reading.

54:37.945 --> 54:40.781
It's Yeats. Keep your head back.

54:41.698 --> 54:43.617
Why don't you talk
a little Yeats to her.

54:43.826 --> 54:46.411
Show her what a treat that is.

54:47.037 --> 54:48.997
When the hell they gonna get to her?

54:49.164 --> 54:51.375
I'm okay, Frankie.

54:52.167 --> 54:55.128
-What'd you learn tonight?
-Always protect myself.

54:55.295 --> 54:58.382
-What's the rule?
-Always protect myself.

54:58.507 --> 55:00.425
-Margaret Fitzgerald?
-Here.

55:04.930 --> 55:06.890
I'll be right here.

55:18.861 --> 55:21.321
-How you doing?
-Me?

55:21.530 --> 55:23.448
-Yeah, you.
-I'm not the one who's hurt.

55:28.328 --> 55:30.122
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

55:30.914 --> 55:33.167
Why are you telling me that?

55:35.335 --> 55:36.670
No reason.

55:36.920 --> 55:41.091
<i>But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.</i>

55:41.383 --> 55:45.888
<i>And no matter how hard you work at it,
you just can't stop the bleeding.</i>

55:46.096 --> 55:49.433
-Did you write your daughter?
-Every week.

55:50.976 --> 55:53.979
I've no idea why you come to church.

56:25.177 --> 56:29.932
<i>After her 12th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple of real good offers.</i>

56:32.434 --> 56:35.103
<i>The first was to fight
Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman...</i>

56:35.270 --> 56:37.564
<i>...for the WBA welterweight title.</i>

56:39.525 --> 56:41.360
Billie "The Blue Bear."

56:41.485 --> 56:44.613
<i>Billie was a former prostitute
out of East Berlin.</i>

56:44.780 --> 56:48.992
<i>Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.</i>

57:07.427 --> 57:08.887
<i>Didn't seem to matter to her...</i>

57:09.012 --> 57:11.682
<i>...that something like that
could kill a person.</i>

57:12.558 --> 57:14.810
<i>And the crowds loved her.</i>

57:17.688 --> 57:20.649
<i>He turned it down
without even telling her.</i>

57:20.858 --> 57:23.152
<i>The next was to fight
the British champ...</i>

57:23.277 --> 57:26.572
<i>-...a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.
-Hello?</i>

57:27.364 --> 57:29.366
Not interested.

57:32.244 --> 57:34.746
<i>He turned that down too.</i>

57:36.957 --> 57:39.293
That's a lot of money, boss.

57:39.459 --> 57:42.880
Yeah, you're making money.
What are you still working here for?

57:43.046 --> 57:44.756
It's a title match, right?

57:44.923 --> 57:47.926
Are you British?
It's a title you can't take away.

57:48.093 --> 57:51.471
She's got nothing to lose,
you got nothing to win.

57:52.222 --> 57:54.808
Might still be a good fight.

57:54.975 --> 57:58.479
Yeah, I just-- I just brought you up
to welterweight.

57:58.687 --> 58:02.107
Too good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

58:02.316 --> 58:05.277
Didn't notice I was fighting
any contenders.

58:06.111 --> 58:09.281
Well, you can get yourself
another manager any time you want.

58:10.365 --> 58:13.285
In fact, if you'd learn
to protect your face a little better...

58:13.452 --> 58:15.996
...I wouldn't have
to turn down this money.

58:19.374 --> 58:22.878
My face is out there so much it's a miracle
I haven't been knocked out yet.

58:52.825 --> 58:54.618
No, you can't work here
anymore tonight.

58:55.661 --> 58:57.496
I made us a reservation.

58:58.831 --> 59:01.333
You might wanna shower.

59:22.729 --> 59:24.857
Here you go.

59:25.023 --> 59:26.900
Here you go.

59:27.401 --> 59:29.111
What's this?

59:29.236 --> 59:32.573
Well, it ain't no big secret
what you're wishing for.

59:33.115 --> 59:34.575
Go on and blow.

59:39.454 --> 59:41.248
Thank you.

59:45.335 --> 59:47.838
Thirty-three ain't so old.

59:48.547 --> 59:51.425
I was still fighting at 39.

59:52.676 --> 59:55.220
Fought for 23 years.

59:58.932 --> 1:00:00.642
How's it going, Scrap?

1:00:00.767 --> 1:00:02.478
Doing good, Mickey.

1:00:03.562 --> 1:00:05.355
Doing good.

1:00:06.773 --> 1:00:09.276
-What'll you have?
-Coffee.

1:00:14.781 --> 1:00:17.075
You two not speaking?

1:00:17.493 --> 1:00:19.745
Don't hardly know him.

1:00:24.666 --> 1:00:28.879
I met Frankie right after
my 37th birthday.

1:00:29.922 --> 1:00:32.424
He was picking up cut work.

1:00:33.425 --> 1:00:37.137
He used to patch me up
when I thought it was impossible.

1:00:38.472 --> 1:00:40.474
Good man to have in your corner.

1:00:41.433 --> 1:00:43.352
Yes, he is.

1:00:44.937 --> 1:00:48.148
He stayed with me
through my last fight in San Berdu.

1:00:48.899 --> 1:00:52.361
My manager was off
getting drunk somewhere...

1:00:52.903 --> 1:00:56.406
...and it was just Frankie and me.

1:00:58.283 --> 1:01:01.078
I was taking a hellacious beating.

1:01:02.538 --> 1:01:05.874
Everybody's got a particular number
of fights in him.

1:01:06.583 --> 1:01:09.503
Nobody tells you what that number is.

1:01:10.462 --> 1:01:13.131
Mine was 109.

1:01:13.715 --> 1:01:16.009
I just didn't want to admit it.

1:01:17.761 --> 1:01:20.097
Fourth round, this...

1:01:20.806 --> 1:01:22.224
...cut opens up.

1:01:22.683 --> 1:01:25.477
Blood starts pouring into my eye.

1:01:27.396 --> 1:01:31.358
They should've stopped the fight, but,
hell, I was a black man in San Berdu.

1:01:31.525 --> 1:01:33.694
Blood was what I was there for.

1:01:34.611 --> 1:01:38.157
Round after round, I kept getting
Frankie to patch me up.

1:01:38.699 --> 1:01:40.742
He's talking about
throwing in the towel...

1:01:40.868 --> 1:01:44.246
...but he ain't my manager,
he can't throw in nothing.

1:01:45.289 --> 1:01:47.541
Round after round...

1:01:47.708 --> 1:01:50.002
...he's arguing with me.

1:01:51.420 --> 1:01:55.507
And I'm almost laughing because, hell,
it's getting more to him than to me.

1:01:56.425 --> 1:01:58.927
I go 15 rounds...

1:01:59.094 --> 1:02:01.305
...Iose by decision.

1:02:02.014 --> 1:02:04.349
Next morning, I lose the eye.

1:02:06.894 --> 1:02:10.355
In 23 years, he's never said
a thing about it.

1:02:11.315 --> 1:02:15.402
Doesn't have to. I can see it
in his face every time he looks at me.

1:02:16.236 --> 1:02:18.071
Somehow...

1:02:19.031 --> 1:02:21.658
...Frankie thinks he should've
stopped that fight...

1:02:22.534 --> 1:02:24.912
...should've saved my eye.

1:02:27.122 --> 1:02:31.210
Spends his life wishing he could
take back that 109th fight.

1:02:32.085 --> 1:02:34.963
I wanted to go to 110.

1:02:35.589 --> 1:02:37.591
Thing is...

1:02:38.258 --> 1:02:40.052
...if you wanna get to the title...

1:02:41.386 --> 1:02:44.014
...maybe he's not the one
to take you there.

1:02:49.228 --> 1:02:51.355
You tell Mr. Mack we'd be here tonight?

1:02:54.608 --> 1:02:56.819
You go on, eat your cupcake.

1:02:56.985 --> 1:02:59.738
No, I got it.

1:03:05.285 --> 1:03:06.620
<i>It's the rule.</i>

1:03:06.829 --> 1:03:09.248
<i>Always protect yourself.</i>

1:03:09.790 --> 1:03:12.584
<i>People never take their own advice.</i>

1:03:12.751 --> 1:03:17.798
<i>If she was gonna leave Frankie,
better she did it to him then.</i>

1:03:22.177 --> 1:03:24.137
Mr. Mickey Mack?

1:03:24.304 --> 1:03:26.640
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

1:03:26.932 --> 1:03:32.688
I hear you're a real good manager,
doing good things for Big Willie.

1:03:33.105 --> 1:03:36.150
But I thought you should know
I ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn...

1:03:37.109 --> 1:03:40.112
...so you don't need to make any more
excuses to bump into me.

1:03:42.156 --> 1:03:44.575
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

1:03:48.287 --> 1:03:52.416
<i>Maggie always did like
taking them out in the first round.</i>

1:04:25.657 --> 1:04:29.536
<i>The letters always came back
marked the same way:</i>

1:04:29.703 --> 1:04:31.872
<i>"Return to sender. "</i>

1:05:01.401 --> 1:05:03.904
I'll make you some coffee.

1:05:05.864 --> 1:05:07.574
What are you doing with your money?

1:05:08.200 --> 1:05:10.285
-Saving it.
-Good girl.

1:05:12.079 --> 1:05:15.541
You know, you save enough of it,
you ought to get yourself a little house.

1:05:15.707 --> 1:05:17.000
Cash, no mortgage.

1:05:17.167 --> 1:05:19.753
Gonna be a while before I can do that.

1:05:22.881 --> 1:05:26.093
Yeah, well, it might be a stretch...

1:05:26.218 --> 1:05:28.887
...but you gotta get yourself
a place of your own.

1:05:29.096 --> 1:05:32.307
Go around wasting it on things
that don't matter and what do you got?

1:05:32.724 --> 1:05:34.184
You understand?

1:05:34.393 --> 1:05:38.272
Pretty soon, you wait long enough,
you got nothing.

1:05:38.438 --> 1:05:40.399
Okay, soon as I get the money.

1:05:40.566 --> 1:05:44.611
I made a lot of mistakes in my life. I'm just
trying to keep you from doing the same.

1:05:45.112 --> 1:05:46.697
I know, boss.

1:05:48.073 --> 1:05:50.534
-I'm not gonna live forever.
-What is it?

1:05:50.701 --> 1:05:53.370
It's a tape on that girl in England
you're gonna fight.

1:05:53.620 --> 1:05:56.832
If you're gonna go for the title,
we got some moves to-- Hey.

1:05:56.999 --> 1:05:59.710
Hey, get the hell down.
You know how old I am?

1:05:59.877 --> 1:06:02.504
-Thank you, boss. Thank you so much.
-Yeah.

1:06:02.671 --> 1:06:07.092
You're welcome, darling. Here, just--
Here, let me put this in the machine.

1:06:07.301 --> 1:06:09.261
What machine?

1:06:09.928 --> 1:06:11.471
Don't have a TV, huh?

1:06:11.638 --> 1:06:13.390
No.

1:06:14.099 --> 1:06:15.851
Yeah!

1:06:16.310 --> 1:06:19.062
All right. Okay.

1:06:25.152 --> 1:06:27.571
-Ten minutes, love.
-Thank you.

1:06:27.946 --> 1:06:29.364
Man says he loves me.

1:06:29.490 --> 1:06:31.575
He's probably not
the first one to say that.

1:06:31.825 --> 1:06:34.036
First since my daddy.

1:06:34.620 --> 1:06:36.330
I win, you think he'll propose?

1:06:36.663 --> 1:06:38.790
You win, I'll propose.

1:06:42.669 --> 1:06:44.588
Look, I got you a gift here.

1:06:49.801 --> 1:06:51.637
I think they gave you somebody else's.

1:06:51.803 --> 1:06:53.764
No, no, this is it.

1:06:54.807 --> 1:06:56.266
What's it mean?

1:06:56.433 --> 1:07:00.229
I don't know.
Just something in Gaelic.

1:07:01.146 --> 1:07:04.900
-It's beautiful.
-Yeah, I thought so.

1:07:05.067 --> 1:07:06.902
-Yeah.
-Real silk thread.

1:07:10.489 --> 1:07:14.868
From the United States
of America, the challenger...

1:07:15.035 --> 1:07:18.372
...Maggie Fitzgerald.

1:07:20.123 --> 1:07:22.209
<i>Mo cuishle.
Did you see what was on her robe?</i>

1:07:22.376 --> 1:07:24.628
<i>-Mo cuishle. Mo cuishle.
-Mo cuishle.</i>

1:07:28.841 --> 1:07:30.676
<i>She wasn't the main attraction.</i>

1:07:30.843 --> 1:07:34.555
<i>She was on the undercard
of a middleweight title fight.</i>

1:07:34.888 --> 1:07:36.890
<i>But ask someone who was there...</i>

1:07:37.099 --> 1:07:40.060
<i>...they couldn't tell you who else
fought that night.</i>

1:07:46.191 --> 1:07:47.901
Box.

1:08:08.422 --> 1:08:09.965
<i>-Come on!
-Mo cuishle!</i>

1:08:10.632 --> 1:08:14.845
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1:08:16.054 --> 1:08:17.639
<i>Mo cuishle!</i>

1:08:18.974 --> 1:08:20.058
<i>Mo cuishle!</i>

1:08:21.894 --> 1:08:24.897
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1:08:33.739 --> 1:08:35.449
She's tough.

1:08:37.117 --> 1:08:39.620
I can't get inside.
I can't get close enough to hit her.

1:08:39.786 --> 1:08:42.206
-You know why that is?
-Why?

1:08:42.664 --> 1:08:44.625
She's a better fighter than you are.

1:08:44.791 --> 1:08:48.879
She's younger, she's stronger,
and she's more experienced. Now...

1:08:49.046 --> 1:08:51.256
...what are you gonna do about it?

1:08:59.306 --> 1:09:01.058
Get in there.

1:09:01.809 --> 1:09:03.352
Box.

1:09:16.949 --> 1:09:21.787
Three, four, five, six...

1:09:21.912 --> 1:09:27.084
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

1:09:27.835 --> 1:09:31.380
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1:09:38.512 --> 1:09:41.849
<i>-Mo cuishle!
-Mo cuishle!</i>

1:09:49.022 --> 1:09:51.191
I could ask someone, you know?

1:09:51.775 --> 1:09:53.110
Good.

1:09:53.277 --> 1:09:55.320
You find out, you let me know.

1:10:02.536 --> 1:10:05.330
<i>Whatever it meant, the name stuck.</i>

1:10:05.497 --> 1:10:10.002
<i>Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris,
Brussels and Amsterdam.</i>

1:10:10.210 --> 1:10:13.005
<i>It was always mo cuishle.</i>

1:10:13.297 --> 1:10:15.632
<i>Seems there are
Irish people everywhere...</i>

1:10:15.799 --> 1:10:18.093
<i>...or people who wanna be.</i>

1:10:18.552 --> 1:10:21.013
<i>By the time they came back
to the States...</i>

1:10:21.889 --> 1:10:24.975
<i>...Maggie was in a whole new league.</i>

1:10:42.075 --> 1:10:46.538
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1:10:56.423 --> 1:10:59.551
<i>After that they got another offer
to fight for the title.</i>

1:11:01.887 --> 1:11:03.806
What's the split?

1:11:04.389 --> 1:11:06.809
-Sixty-forty.
-Good.

1:11:06.975 --> 1:11:10.938
We'll take 60 and you take 40,
being as that Maggie's the draw.

1:11:11.438 --> 1:11:12.856
That little girl?

1:11:13.232 --> 1:11:16.610
You think I'm wrong, really?
You think people are saying...

1:11:16.777 --> 1:11:20.572
...that they wanna see some scabby Kraut
beat up on little Miss What's-Her-Name?

1:11:20.739 --> 1:11:23.784
You find someone who says that,
and we'll take the 40.

1:11:31.333 --> 1:11:33.043
There you go.

1:11:35.963 --> 1:11:39.716
They're at 60-40,
but they'll come up to 50-50.

1:11:40.509 --> 1:11:42.261
How's that girl doing?

1:11:42.427 --> 1:11:45.556
Well, she's got a concussion
and a broken eardrum.

1:11:45.722 --> 1:11:47.641
She be all right?

1:11:47.891 --> 1:11:51.728
-And if she isn't?
-Maybe I should send her something.

1:11:51.854 --> 1:11:56.024
Well, you could send her your check
if you'd like. I'm sure she'd take it.

1:12:01.029 --> 1:12:02.823
Boss?

1:12:02.990 --> 1:12:04.867
That little house we talked about?

1:12:05.492 --> 1:12:06.702
I bought it.

1:12:07.369 --> 1:12:09.746
Well, smart girl.

1:12:10.372 --> 1:12:14.209
For my mama. It's only about a mile
from where she lives now.

1:12:14.334 --> 1:12:16.461
No mortgage, just like you said.

1:12:18.755 --> 1:12:20.841
You're a good daughter.

1:12:21.466 --> 1:12:23.552
She don't know about it yet.

1:12:23.719 --> 1:12:27.306
I was hoping maybe we could
stay an extra day, drive over there?

1:12:27.473 --> 1:12:29.391
I know she wants to meet you.

1:12:32.060 --> 1:12:34.605
Yeah, we could do that.

1:12:51.663 --> 1:12:54.833
Oh, my God. Mama, come on out here.

1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.169
Mary M.'s here.

1:13:14.228 --> 1:13:18.315
-This is the Johnsons' old house.
-Not anymore.

1:13:22.027 --> 1:13:25.823
It's all yours, Mama.
For you and Mardell and the kids.

1:13:26.031 --> 1:13:29.827
-Mary M., you bought this for me?
-Yeah, all yours, free and clear.

1:13:29.952 --> 1:13:31.703
Darling....

1:13:31.870 --> 1:13:34.206
There's no fridge. No stove neither.

1:13:34.373 --> 1:13:36.667
They'll be here before you move in.

1:13:37.918 --> 1:13:40.254
-How much money did this cost you?
-Never mind that.

1:13:40.462 --> 1:13:43.131
-You shouldn't have done this.
-You need a decent place.

1:13:43.298 --> 1:13:46.635
You shouldn't have done it.
You should've asked me first.

1:13:48.011 --> 1:13:51.223
Government's gonna find out about this,
they're gonna stop my welfare.

1:13:51.390 --> 1:13:55.269
-Mama, no, they ain't.
-They are. You're fine, you're working...

1:13:55.394 --> 1:13:57.271
...but I can't live without my welfare.

1:13:57.396 --> 1:13:59.106
Mama, I'll send you money.

1:13:59.398 --> 1:14:02.651
What about my medicine?
Medicaid gonna cut me off.

1:14:02.860 --> 1:14:06.488
-How am I supposed to get my medicine?
-I'll send you more money.

1:14:06.822 --> 1:14:09.116
I hope you don't expect J.D.
to move in with us.

1:14:09.283 --> 1:14:10.534
He's getting out, you know.

1:14:11.285 --> 1:14:13.704
Why didn't you just give me the money?

1:14:14.705 --> 1:14:17.374
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

1:14:18.500 --> 1:14:23.046
I didn't have to, Mama, but it's yours.

1:14:23.297 --> 1:14:25.424
You want the money, sell it.

1:14:31.972 --> 1:14:33.599
I don't--

1:14:40.147 --> 1:14:42.065
I know you didn't mean
nothing hurtful...

1:14:42.232 --> 1:14:44.651
...but sometimes you just
don't think things through.

1:14:44.818 --> 1:14:48.322
-That's true, Mama.
-I'll try and keep the house.

1:14:48.822 --> 1:14:51.158
I'm just worried about
all those expenses.

1:14:51.325 --> 1:14:53.243
I'll send you some more money.

1:15:02.419 --> 1:15:04.671
That man hitting you?

1:15:06.173 --> 1:15:08.342
It's from the fight.

1:15:08.717 --> 1:15:10.302
I'm a fighter, Mama.

1:15:11.178 --> 1:15:13.096
Find a man, Mary M.

1:15:13.305 --> 1:15:14.932
Live proper.

1:15:15.098 --> 1:15:18.101
People hear about what you're doing
and they laugh.

1:15:18.310 --> 1:15:21.355
Hurts me to tell you,
but they laugh at you.

1:16:13.031 --> 1:16:14.867
Hi.

1:16:44.897 --> 1:16:47.274
You ever own a dog?

1:16:47.441 --> 1:16:48.942
Nope.

1:16:49.151 --> 1:16:53.739
Closest I ever came was
a middleweight from Barstow.

1:16:55.782 --> 1:17:00.120
My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.

1:17:00.329 --> 1:17:02.039
Axel's hindquarters were so bad...

1:17:02.164 --> 1:17:05.792
...he had to drag himself
room to room by his front legs.

1:17:05.959 --> 1:17:08.962
Me and Mardell would bust up laughing...

1:17:09.129 --> 1:17:12.925
...watching him scoot
across the kitchen floor.

1:17:13.425 --> 1:17:17.221
Daddy, he was so sick by then,
he couldn't hardly stand himself.

1:17:18.555 --> 1:17:22.142
But one morning he got up,
carried Axel to his rig...

1:17:22.309 --> 1:17:26.688
...and the two of them went off
into the woods, singing and howling.

1:17:27.481 --> 1:17:30.943
But it wasn't till he got home
that night alone that I saw...

1:17:31.151 --> 1:17:33.737
...the shovel in the back of the truck.

1:17:38.742 --> 1:17:41.495
Sure miss watching
the two of them together.

1:17:50.504 --> 1:17:52.965
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

1:17:56.218 --> 1:17:58.137
Well, you've got me.

1:18:00.597 --> 1:18:04.768
At least, that is,
until we find you a good manager.

1:18:12.734 --> 1:18:16.655
Hey, can we stop just up here?

1:18:17.030 --> 1:18:18.699
Yeah.

1:18:19.283 --> 1:18:22.202
This place has
the best lemon pie around.

1:18:22.369 --> 1:18:25.330
None of that canned-filling crap.

1:18:39.887 --> 1:18:42.556
Now I can die and go to heaven.

1:18:47.436 --> 1:18:49.354
I used to come here with Daddy.

1:18:50.564 --> 1:18:53.108
Wonder if a place like this is for sale.

1:18:53.233 --> 1:18:55.819
I got a little bit of savings.

1:19:02.868 --> 1:19:05.370
That's fine, fine, thanks.

1:19:10.083 --> 1:19:12.211
Hey, what the hell's Danger looking at?

1:19:13.003 --> 1:19:15.255
Looks like another bottle of water.

1:19:15.422 --> 1:19:17.716
Wanna come to Vegas with us?

1:19:18.133 --> 1:19:22.846
Watch you suffer over the nickel slots?
My heart can't take that kind of pounding.

1:19:23.096 --> 1:19:26.683
Well, she's got a title shot.
The Blue Bear.

1:19:26.850 --> 1:19:28.852
Million dollars,
split right down the center.

1:19:29.019 --> 1:19:30.854
That's good, Frankie. That's real good.

1:19:30.979 --> 1:19:32.606
Well, I could use a good second.

1:19:32.773 --> 1:19:34.566
Can't find one,
I thought I'd ask you.

1:19:34.733 --> 1:19:36.819
Now, why the hell
would I wanna do that?

1:19:37.319 --> 1:19:41.365
Well, because you're a half-blind old fool
who never got there himself.

1:19:41.615 --> 1:19:45.285
I thought you might like to feel what
it's like to be in a ring on a title match.

1:19:45.452 --> 1:19:47.454
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

1:19:48.664 --> 1:19:51.124
No, you pick up somebody
there in Vegas.

1:19:52.626 --> 1:19:54.378
Somebody with young hands.

1:19:54.503 --> 1:19:57.548
You're not gonna cry now, are you?
I've already got one girl.

1:19:59.424 --> 1:20:01.260
I leave this place for one day...

1:20:01.468 --> 1:20:04.263
...got any idea what it would look like
when I come back?

1:20:04.471 --> 1:20:06.265
Kind of like it looks right now.

1:20:06.473 --> 1:20:07.850
Oh, go to hell.

1:20:09.685 --> 1:20:12.771
You tell Maggie don't come back here
without a belt.

1:20:13.188 --> 1:20:14.773
Will do.

1:20:18.819 --> 1:20:20.821
Hey, Mr. Scrap.

1:20:20.988 --> 1:20:24.241
I got a question,
but I feel real stupid asking it.

1:20:24.449 --> 1:20:26.660
No such thing as
a stupid question there, Danger.

1:20:26.827 --> 1:20:28.620
Okay.

1:20:30.914 --> 1:20:34.960
How'd you get all the ice in here
through this little tiny hole?

1:20:35.169 --> 1:20:37.212
I've been thinking on it.

1:20:37.337 --> 1:20:39.131
Can't figure it out.

1:20:39.339 --> 1:20:40.966
Why don't I show you, Danger.

1:20:41.133 --> 1:20:44.428
-You could do that? You could show me?
-I think so. I think so.

1:20:44.636 --> 1:20:49.641
Also, Mr. Scrap, I was kind of thinking
I might be ready for a fight.

1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:55.981
Well, I got the tickets. You ready?

1:20:56.190 --> 1:20:59.067
-We're flying?
-Would you rather drive?

1:21:00.444 --> 1:21:02.154
You're asking me?

1:21:02.779 --> 1:21:05.574
Would you rather fly,
or would you rather drive?

1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:08.494
So I finally get to decide something?

1:21:08.702 --> 1:21:10.037
That's what I'm saying.

1:21:10.621 --> 1:21:11.830
Fine.

1:21:11.997 --> 1:21:13.749
Fly there, drive back.

1:21:14.166 --> 1:21:17.794
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
How the hell we gonna do that?

1:21:18.086 --> 1:21:19.713
You said it was up to me.

1:21:29.890 --> 1:21:32.142
Give them hell there, Danger.

1:21:32.309 --> 1:21:35.312
Hey, old school,
the toilet's overflowing.

1:21:39.650 --> 1:21:42.486
Hey, Flippy, come here for a minute.

1:21:44.488 --> 1:21:46.198
Jesus.

1:21:46.532 --> 1:21:49.076
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1:21:49.576 --> 1:21:51.703
Oh, God!

1:21:56.041 --> 1:21:57.376
Dumb-ass.

1:21:57.793 --> 1:22:00.170
Come on, Danger. Come on, Danger.

1:22:00.420 --> 1:22:01.797
Come on. Defense!

1:22:02.464 --> 1:22:04.716
Could be sitting up at the Mirage...

1:22:05.509 --> 1:22:07.427
...drinking mai tais...

1:22:08.262 --> 1:22:09.805
...Iooking at naked women.

1:22:09.972 --> 1:22:13.183
Come on, Danger,
put up your hands and fight.

1:22:16.061 --> 1:22:17.896
Danger, get out of there!

1:22:25.237 --> 1:22:27.072
Fight back! Come on!

1:22:27.281 --> 1:22:29.908
-There you go, Danger, there you go!
-Good job, man.

1:22:30.576 --> 1:22:32.077
Jab him with the left.
Come on.

1:22:32.286 --> 1:22:33.495
Come on.

1:22:42.671 --> 1:22:44.131
Hey, come on now, Flip.

1:22:44.298 --> 1:22:46.425
-What you doing? Let him go.
-All right. Okay.

1:22:46.633 --> 1:22:48.927
I got you. Come on, come on.

1:22:50.554 --> 1:22:52.055
It's all right.

1:22:53.640 --> 1:22:55.100
We don't need no corner trainer.

1:22:55.309 --> 1:22:56.643
How'd I do, Mr. Scrap?

1:22:56.810 --> 1:22:58.729
You did good, Danger. You did real good.

1:22:58.896 --> 1:23:01.023
You my man. You rock.

1:23:01.148 --> 1:23:03.150
Come on, Flip, man, you ain't done.

1:23:03.275 --> 1:23:06.069
You ain't even fight good yet.

1:23:06.236 --> 1:23:08.155
Anybody can lose one fight.

1:23:08.280 --> 1:23:10.824
Anybody can lose one, son.
You'll come back from this.

1:23:10.991 --> 1:23:12.576
You'll be champion of the world.

1:23:12.826 --> 1:23:15.078
No, I won't, Mr. Scrap.

1:23:16.038 --> 1:23:17.706
I should have knowed.

1:23:17.915 --> 1:23:20.459
-Come on. We don't need to be talking.
-Let me help you.

1:23:20.626 --> 1:23:24.171
Oh, no, I can do her.
Just untie the Velcro for me.

1:23:25.172 --> 1:23:26.256
All right.

1:23:27.674 --> 1:23:31.178
Come on, don't take the gloves off, man.
You ain't even used them, Danger.

1:23:32.638 --> 1:23:35.349
Mind if I borrow this, Danger?

1:23:35.933 --> 1:23:38.310
Man, I thought your name was Danger.

1:23:39.019 --> 1:23:40.604
Come on, now.

1:23:40.813 --> 1:23:44.775
Oh, oh, I see. Now I get to fight
a retard and a old man.

1:23:45.359 --> 1:23:48.946
Call ESPN, because you can't
write this shit.

1:23:56.703 --> 1:23:59.832
Look out, Shawrelle. Easy, Shawrelle.

1:24:00.999 --> 1:24:02.251
Keep going, man.

1:24:02.376 --> 1:24:04.169
All right, man.

1:24:11.510 --> 1:24:12.970
He ain't so tough.

1:24:13.345 --> 1:24:15.264
One hundred and ten.

1:24:20.185 --> 1:24:21.812
Get a job, punk.

1:24:53.343 --> 1:24:56.263
Win this one, I'll tell you what it means.

1:24:57.264 --> 1:24:59.349
I got you some pipers.

1:25:12.946 --> 1:25:16.867
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1:25:17.451 --> 1:25:21.371
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1:25:30.172 --> 1:25:31.632
All right, now!

1:26:21.515 --> 1:26:23.934
I want you to jab her right in the tits...

1:26:24.101 --> 1:26:26.186
...until they turn blue and fall off.

1:26:42.369 --> 1:26:45.664
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the feature...</i>

1:26:45.831 --> 1:26:48.125
...presentation of the evening.

1:26:48.292 --> 1:26:52.796
In this corner, the challenger,
Maggie Fitzgerald...

1:26:53.255 --> 1:26:55.048
...in the red corner.

1:26:55.257 --> 1:26:56.842
In the blue corner...

1:26:57.009 --> 1:27:01.388
...the WBA welterweight champion
of the world...

1:27:01.555 --> 1:27:04.433
...Billie "The Blue Bear."

1:27:07.603 --> 1:27:09.396
Sweet Jesus.

1:27:25.037 --> 1:27:28.540
<i>Fitzgerald is pushing The Blue Bear
around the ring. She's coming on strong.</i>

1:27:31.418 --> 1:27:34.505
Challenger darts in, lands a combination
to the head and the body.

1:27:34.630 --> 1:27:36.757
<i>-And a right hook stuns the champ.
-All right.</i>

1:27:38.842 --> 1:27:40.135
Break it up!

1:27:43.096 --> 1:27:45.098
Break it! Break it!

1:27:51.104 --> 1:27:53.982
Do that one more time,
it'll cost you a point, do you hear me?

1:27:56.109 --> 1:27:57.444
Go fight.

1:28:05.410 --> 1:28:07.246
You motherfucker.

1:28:15.420 --> 1:28:17.881
Come on. What the fuck?

1:28:18.048 --> 1:28:20.717
All right, that's it.
I'm gonna take away a point.

1:28:20.968 --> 1:28:23.178
One point deduction
off the blue corner.

1:28:24.805 --> 1:28:26.390
<i>--comes back, hits Fitzgerald....</i>

1:28:26.557 --> 1:28:27.975
Ref, open your eyes, you....

1:28:45.993 --> 1:28:49.746
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the first round
is in the books on this championship match.</i>

1:28:53.250 --> 1:28:55.627
-Hold onto that.
-There you go.

1:29:00.424 --> 1:29:02.801
-Looking good.
-You pull that crap one more time...

1:29:02.968 --> 1:29:04.720
...you're disqualified.

1:29:12.978 --> 1:29:14.563
It's gonna be all right.

1:29:14.688 --> 1:29:16.482
Got no doubt, boss.

1:29:19.359 --> 1:29:21.862
Okay, just watch yourself.

1:29:22.070 --> 1:29:23.489
Stay away from this dame.

1:29:35.959 --> 1:29:38.670
Go to the neutral corner.
Neutral corner.

1:29:39.630 --> 1:29:43.008
-Four, five, six...
-Stay down, you bitch.

1:29:43.133 --> 1:29:46.553
...seven, eight, nine.

1:29:59.525 --> 1:30:00.984
Yeah, yeah!

1:30:02.611 --> 1:30:04.154
Break it! Break it!

1:30:11.078 --> 1:30:14.832
<i>Fitzgerald continues to pummel
The Blue Bear. The East German champion....</i>

1:30:28.679 --> 1:30:30.389
Yes! Come on!

1:30:30.764 --> 1:30:32.099
I got it! I got it.

1:30:38.856 --> 1:30:40.232
Eyes are blurring, boss.

1:30:40.399 --> 1:30:43.193
-How many eyes you need to finish this?
-One's enough.

1:30:46.572 --> 1:30:48.240
-Good.
-Now...

1:30:48.448 --> 1:30:49.950
...what do I do about the Bear?

1:30:50.117 --> 1:30:53.078
Do you know that step into the outside
and hook into the liver?

1:30:53.245 --> 1:30:56.790
-I been doing that. She's made of steel.
-I don't want you to go to the liver.

1:30:56.999 --> 1:30:59.877
I want you to hit her right up
under her skinny ass, understand?

1:31:00.127 --> 1:31:03.172
Right in the sciatic nerve.
Just keep digging it in there.

1:31:03.338 --> 1:31:05.424
And just keep sticking her.
You hear that?

1:31:05.799 --> 1:31:08.594
-What about the ref?
-Keep between the ref and the Bear...

1:31:08.760 --> 1:31:10.512
...and everything will just be fine.

1:31:12.681 --> 1:31:14.558
This is yours. You keep your guard up.

1:31:14.725 --> 1:31:16.226
You keep it up.

1:31:29.865 --> 1:31:31.241
Oh, yeah!

1:31:42.211 --> 1:31:43.879
Break, break!

1:31:50.677 --> 1:31:54.348
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1:32:24.211 --> 1:32:25.587
Doctor.

1:32:40.394 --> 1:32:41.645
Come on.

1:32:42.062 --> 1:32:43.522
Breathe.

1:32:43.730 --> 1:32:46.275
That's it. Breathe.

1:32:46.733 --> 1:32:48.360
Good.

1:32:48.569 --> 1:32:50.028
Look at me. Concentrate on me.

1:32:50.863 --> 1:32:52.030
Breathe.

1:32:52.781 --> 1:32:54.283
Good.

1:32:54.741 --> 1:32:56.034
That's it.

1:32:57.411 --> 1:32:58.704
Breathe.

1:33:47.127 --> 1:33:48.921
How you feeling, darling?

1:33:57.471 --> 1:33:59.765
Growing a beard, boss?

1:34:00.557 --> 1:34:03.393
I thought it might help me
with the ladies.

1:34:05.354 --> 1:34:07.564
Can't say it does.

1:34:34.967 --> 1:34:37.386
Does it--? Does it hurt much?

1:34:39.221 --> 1:34:41.390
Don't hurt at all.

1:34:43.308 --> 1:34:44.977
Well, that's good.

1:34:50.566 --> 1:34:52.234
Where's Frankie?

1:34:54.319 --> 1:34:55.779
Well, he's....

1:34:55.946 --> 1:34:58.323
He's out there talking to the doctors.

1:34:58.490 --> 1:35:01.577
Probably telling them how to do their job.

1:35:03.871 --> 1:35:08.208
They're telling him
I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

1:35:11.462 --> 1:35:16.175
Means that my spinal cord's so broke
they'll never be able to fix it.

1:35:19.803 --> 1:35:23.390
Gonna be frozen like this
the rest of my life.

1:35:28.395 --> 1:35:32.232
I asked them to tell him.
I don't know how he's gonna take it.

1:35:40.699 --> 1:35:42.701
Did you see the fight?

1:35:45.287 --> 1:35:46.997
Of course I did.

1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:49.958
You had her cold, Maggie.

1:35:51.543 --> 1:35:54.505
I shouldn't have dropped my hands.

1:35:58.425 --> 1:36:00.594
I shouldn't have turned.

1:36:07.601 --> 1:36:09.436
Always protect myself.

1:36:09.603 --> 1:36:12.731
How many times he tell me that?

1:36:13.899 --> 1:36:15.359
Yeah...

1:36:16.401 --> 1:36:18.570
...he does like to repeat himself.

1:36:22.366 --> 1:36:25.702
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

1:36:29.748 --> 1:36:31.208
No.

1:36:31.917 --> 1:36:34.169
I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

1:36:54.314 --> 1:36:55.858
Damnedest thing.

1:36:59.736 --> 1:37:01.488
So, what's the plan?

1:37:02.364 --> 1:37:05.659
I know you got one,
so you might as well tell me what it is.

1:37:05.826 --> 1:37:07.619
It's your fault.

1:37:08.162 --> 1:37:11.165
Yeah, it's your fault
she's lying in there like that.

1:37:11.373 --> 1:37:13.292
You kept after me until I trained her.

1:37:13.834 --> 1:37:16.753
I knew I shouldn't have done it,
her being a girl and all.

1:37:17.796 --> 1:37:20.215
Everything kept telling me not to.

1:37:20.382 --> 1:37:22.176
Everything but you.

1:37:32.603 --> 1:37:34.313
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:36.440
These doctors around here
don't know squat.

1:37:36.565 --> 1:37:39.568
Otherwise, why would they be
living out here in the desert?

1:37:40.444 --> 1:37:42.654
As soon as you're able to be moved...

1:37:43.030 --> 1:37:46.658
...we'll find some place where
they've actually studied medicine.

1:37:49.536 --> 1:37:51.497
You just rest there, I'II....

1:37:53.290 --> 1:37:54.875
I'm on it.

1:38:03.967 --> 1:38:06.303
<i>Frankie must have called
every hospital in America...</i>

1:38:06.553 --> 1:38:09.306
<i>...looking for somebody
who'd tell him they could fix her.</i>

1:38:09.515 --> 1:38:13.560
<i>He came close twice,
till they checked her over...</i>

1:38:13.894 --> 1:38:15.896
<i>...said there was nothing to be done.</i>

1:38:16.355 --> 1:38:19.566
<i>Took two months till she was
stable enough to move.</i>

1:38:24.905 --> 1:38:27.407
They got nurses for that, you know.

1:38:28.826 --> 1:38:31.119
Yeah, but they're amateurs.

1:38:43.257 --> 1:38:47.553
<i>She developed skin ulcers
because she couldn't change positions.</i>

1:38:58.605 --> 1:39:00.190
Thank you.

1:39:10.159 --> 1:39:13.495
<i>They made the six-hour trip
by ambulance.</i>

1:39:24.882 --> 1:39:27.759
Fly there, drive back.

1:39:34.099 --> 1:39:37.561
<i>The rehab center Frankie found
was a nice place.</i>

1:39:38.020 --> 1:39:39.855
<i>They took good care of Maggie.</i>

1:39:39.980 --> 1:39:42.065
<i>She wouldn't have complained
if they hadn't.</i>

1:39:43.400 --> 1:39:47.321
<i>Took several hours every day
to get her ready for the wheelchair.</i>

1:39:52.576 --> 1:39:54.870
One, two, three, up.

1:39:57.289 --> 1:39:59.583
<i>Since she couldn't breathe on her own...</i>

1:39:59.791 --> 1:40:02.419
<i>...her respirators were always on.</i>

1:40:03.629 --> 1:40:07.466
<i>Oxygen was pumped into her
24 hours a day.</i>

1:40:33.659 --> 1:40:37.037
<i>Maggie's mama called to say
they were all coming for a visit.</i>

1:40:37.162 --> 1:40:40.833
<i>She waited by the window
every day for the next two weeks.</i>

1:40:41.834 --> 1:40:43.127
Sure.

1:40:43.252 --> 1:40:45.879
<i>Frankie finally tracked them down.</i>

1:40:46.046 --> 1:40:50.050
<i>Learned they'd checked into their hotel
six days earlier.</i>

1:40:50.217 --> 1:40:53.554
<i>Kept leaving messages
which were never returned.</i>

1:40:57.641 --> 1:41:00.352
You don't have to hang around all day.

1:41:04.189 --> 1:41:07.151
I like it here. I don't mind.

1:41:07.860 --> 1:41:11.822
In fact, if you weren't here,
I'd come here anyway to read my books.

1:41:14.741 --> 1:41:17.703
Mama will be here soon
to share some of the burden.

1:41:18.036 --> 1:41:19.872
Well, it's no burden.

1:41:20.831 --> 1:41:22.207
Here.

1:41:24.251 --> 1:41:25.586
Read this.

1:41:34.761 --> 1:41:36.847
Okay, okay, that's enough.

1:41:37.306 --> 1:41:38.765
That's terrible.

1:41:41.268 --> 1:41:44.271
Anyway, I'll tell you in English
what you were saying.

1:41:47.191 --> 1:41:48.609
It says:

1:41:48.775 --> 1:41:52.362
<i>I will arise and go now
And go to Innisfree</i>

1:41:52.571 --> 1:41:57.075
<i>And a small cabin build there
Of clay and wattles made</i>

1:41:57.951 --> 1:42:02.414
<i>And I shall have some peace there
For peace comes dropping slow</i>

1:42:02.956 --> 1:42:07.711
<i>Dropping from the veils of the morning
To where the cricket sings.</i>

1:42:10.047 --> 1:42:11.465
Not bad, huh?

1:42:15.969 --> 1:42:18.138
You gonna build a cabin, boss?

1:42:18.806 --> 1:42:20.641
-Me?
-Yeah.

1:42:23.018 --> 1:42:25.771
You know, when you quit all this.

1:42:27.731 --> 1:42:29.358
You mean boxing?

1:42:29.942 --> 1:42:32.528
No, I'll never quit.

1:42:33.529 --> 1:42:36.073
I like the stink too much, I guess.

1:42:41.954 --> 1:42:44.456
You think?
Because I could see you there real easy...

1:42:44.665 --> 1:42:47.000
...with your books and lemon pie.

1:42:49.169 --> 1:42:52.089
How about you?
Would you like to go live in a cabin?

1:42:54.091 --> 1:42:56.385
I could learn how to bake.

1:43:00.347 --> 1:43:01.849
Well, then, I'II....

1:43:02.015 --> 1:43:04.143
Maybe I'll start looking then.

1:43:25.914 --> 1:43:27.416
Yeah.

1:43:30.210 --> 1:43:32.588
-Go ahead.
-All right. Okay, sounds good.

1:43:36.508 --> 1:43:38.844
Hi, I'm Frankie Dunn.
I met you back out in Missouri.

1:43:39.052 --> 1:43:40.345
Where's my little girl?

1:43:40.554 --> 1:43:43.348
Don't you think you ought to go back
to the hotel and change?

1:43:43.557 --> 1:43:46.310
She doesn't know you've been here
a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

1:43:46.477 --> 1:43:49.938
We got business with my sister.
Why don't you just tell us where she is.

1:43:50.063 --> 1:43:52.858
Oh, you must be J.D.
And you must be the business guy?

1:43:53.025 --> 1:43:54.443
There's some rides you missed.

1:43:54.610 --> 1:43:57.237
Why don't you go back.
I'll tell her you couldn't make it.

1:43:57.446 --> 1:43:59.698
I drove all the way here
to take care of my child.

1:43:59.907 --> 1:44:02.034
And you're suggesting
I'm not a good mother?

1:44:02.201 --> 1:44:03.869
Mary M. can't go nowhere.

1:44:04.036 --> 1:44:07.039
If we could've taken her to Disneyland,
we would've.

1:44:08.540 --> 1:44:09.750
Margaret Fitzgerald?

1:44:10.250 --> 1:44:11.919
Right down here, 301.

1:44:12.252 --> 1:44:13.921
-Come on, Mama.
-Let's go.

1:44:20.427 --> 1:44:22.513
And I saw myself breathing.

1:44:22.679 --> 1:44:24.556
Like, my body was going up and down.

1:44:24.723 --> 1:44:27.559
I thought,
"Why didn't somebody tell me?"

1:44:31.021 --> 1:44:33.857
Your hair needs washing.
It's kind of greasy.

1:44:47.996 --> 1:44:49.331
It's just a....

1:44:50.332 --> 1:44:52.417
It's just some kind of legal thing.

1:44:52.668 --> 1:44:53.961
What is it?

1:44:54.128 --> 1:44:56.213
How we all doing here?

1:44:56.338 --> 1:44:58.882
Sorry, darling,
but we ain't got a lot of time.

1:44:59.091 --> 1:45:03.262
Mr. Johnson's charging us a lot of money
to be here to make sure this is done proper.

1:45:03.428 --> 1:45:06.056
Why don't you just leave that.
I'll read it to her later.

1:45:06.223 --> 1:45:07.724
Hey, old man...

1:45:07.975 --> 1:45:09.434
...you part of our family?

1:45:10.352 --> 1:45:12.020
Stay the hell out of this.

1:45:13.605 --> 1:45:15.357
Read it to me, Mama.

1:45:15.524 --> 1:45:19.069
Well, it's just something legal
to protect your money.

1:45:19.820 --> 1:45:21.405
Mama, you don't have to worry.

1:45:22.239 --> 1:45:25.659
The boxing commission's
paying for all this, everything.

1:45:25.993 --> 1:45:28.120
But what if they don't, Mary M?

1:45:28.328 --> 1:45:31.123
Mr. Johnson says
they can take my house.

1:45:31.331 --> 1:45:34.501
If you assign your assets to your mother,
no one can touch them.

1:45:34.668 --> 1:45:36.503
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

1:45:37.296 --> 1:45:40.257
-Nothing.
-Yeah, look, why don't you just leave it.

1:45:40.507 --> 1:45:44.303
-Then I'll just read it to her later on--
-With respect, this ain't your business.

1:45:45.846 --> 1:45:48.265
All right. I'll be out in the hall.

1:45:54.480 --> 1:45:56.857
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

1:45:58.484 --> 1:46:00.235
You sign that paper...

1:46:00.611 --> 1:46:02.696
...it'll take care of your family...

1:46:03.030 --> 1:46:05.282
...the way your daddy
would've wanted you to.

1:46:10.037 --> 1:46:11.997
How do you make your mark?

1:46:14.583 --> 1:46:15.793
Can you hold a pen?

1:46:15.918 --> 1:46:18.337
She gotta do it with her teeth, Mama.

1:46:18.504 --> 1:46:20.547
You gotta put it in her mouth.

1:46:21.965 --> 1:46:23.675
Here you go, honey.

1:46:26.804 --> 1:46:28.847
Did you see the fight, Mama?

1:46:29.139 --> 1:46:31.266
Honey, you know how I feel about that.

1:46:32.810 --> 1:46:34.394
I did pretty good.

1:46:34.603 --> 1:46:36.438
You lost, Mary M.

1:46:37.356 --> 1:46:41.109
Ain't your fault, the way I heard it,
but you lost.

1:46:42.736 --> 1:46:45.447
Don't wanna lose the rest
of what you got left.

1:46:45.906 --> 1:46:47.491
There you go.

1:46:56.750 --> 1:46:58.710
What happened to you?

1:46:59.044 --> 1:47:00.712
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

1:47:02.589 --> 1:47:05.968
Mama, you take Mardell and J.D.
and get home.

1:47:07.845 --> 1:47:11.140
Before I tell that lawyer that you were
so worried about your welfare...

1:47:11.348 --> 1:47:14.560
...you never signed those house papers
like you were supposed to.

1:47:17.396 --> 1:47:19.815
So any time I feel like it,
I can sell that house...

1:47:19.982 --> 1:47:23.193
...from under your fat, lazy,
hillbilly asses.

1:47:25.279 --> 1:47:28.532
And if you ever come back,
that's exactly what I'll do.

1:48:09.907 --> 1:48:14.036
Well, maybe someone ought
to count to 10.

1:48:27.549 --> 1:48:29.676
Don't smell real pretty, does it, doc?

1:48:32.638 --> 1:48:34.264
We might have to lose it, Maggie.

1:49:51.216 --> 1:49:54.094
They took my leg, boss.

1:49:58.974 --> 1:50:01.393
It's gonna be all right, you hear?

1:50:02.269 --> 1:50:05.647
I always hear your voice, boss.

1:50:37.429 --> 1:50:38.972
You need anything?

1:50:42.768 --> 1:50:45.354
<i>I need to know what "mo cuishle" means.</i>

1:50:47.147 --> 1:50:48.941
But you didn't win.

1:50:49.483 --> 1:50:51.401
I don't have to tell you.

1:50:55.155 --> 1:50:57.741
You're the meanest man I ever met.

1:50:57.908 --> 1:51:00.202
No wonder no one loves you.

1:51:03.747 --> 1:51:06.166
You remind me of my daddy.

1:51:08.836 --> 1:51:10.796
Well, he must have been...

1:51:11.338 --> 1:51:14.633
...a very intelligent, handsome man.

1:51:18.470 --> 1:51:21.640
You ain't gonna make me talk
no more Yeats, are you?

1:51:23.559 --> 1:51:24.977
No, I was...

1:51:26.478 --> 1:51:29.398
...Iooking at this catalog
from City College.

1:51:31.692 --> 1:51:34.027
I thought I'd get you a wheelchair...

1:51:34.486 --> 1:51:37.906
...maybe the kind that operates
by blowing through a straw.

1:51:38.699 --> 1:51:41.660
I thought maybe you'd like
to go back to school.

1:51:46.748 --> 1:51:49.168
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

1:51:51.378 --> 1:51:53.130
Sure.

1:51:54.506 --> 1:51:56.467
Anything you want.

1:51:58.218 --> 1:52:01.180
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

1:52:13.984 --> 1:52:16.528
Don't even think about that.

1:52:20.407 --> 1:52:22.826
I can't be like this, Frankie.

1:52:26.038 --> 1:52:27.831
Not after what I done.

1:52:27.998 --> 1:52:30.000
I seen the world.

1:52:33.045 --> 1:52:35.255
People chanted my name.

1:52:36.256 --> 1:52:37.424
Well...

1:52:39.384 --> 1:52:42.846
...not my name,
some damn name you gave me.

1:52:45.849 --> 1:52:48.352
But they were chanting for me.

1:52:51.855 --> 1:52:54.233
I was in magazines.

1:52:57.986 --> 1:53:00.781
You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?

1:53:05.160 --> 1:53:08.872
I was born at 2 pounds,
1 and a half ounces.

1:53:12.251 --> 1:53:15.879
Daddy used to tell me
I fought to get into this world...

1:53:19.258 --> 1:53:21.552
...and I'd fight my way out.

1:53:26.515 --> 1:53:29.476
That's all I wanna do, Frankie.

1:53:31.603 --> 1:53:34.106
I just don't wanna fight you to do it.

1:53:37.067 --> 1:53:38.443
I got what I needed.

1:53:42.447 --> 1:53:44.867
I got it all.

1:53:48.454 --> 1:53:51.498
Don't let them keep
taking it away from me.

1:53:56.587 --> 1:54:01.550
Don't let me lie here till I can't hear
those people chanting no more.

1:54:06.513 --> 1:54:08.807
I can't.

1:54:09.475 --> 1:54:11.602
Please.

1:54:13.645 --> 1:54:16.106
Please, don't ask me.

1:54:18.233 --> 1:54:20.319
I'm asking.

1:54:23.906 --> 1:54:25.782
I can't.

1:55:09.660 --> 1:55:11.620
Hello?

1:55:16.834 --> 1:55:19.128
<i>In the middle of the night...</i>

1:55:19.294 --> 1:55:22.297
<i>...Maggie had found her own solution.</i>

1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:25.008
<i>She had bit her tongue.</i>

1:55:32.099 --> 1:55:34.977
Stop. Stop.

1:55:38.438 --> 1:55:41.066
Look at me. Look at me.

1:55:55.372 --> 1:55:59.168
<i>Nearly bled to death
before they stitched her up.</i>

1:55:59.585 --> 1:56:03.964
<i>She came around and ripped them out
before Frankie even got there.</i>

1:56:04.256 --> 1:56:06.425
<i>They stitched her up again...</i>

1:56:06.592 --> 1:56:09.761
<i>...padded the tongue
so she couldn't bite.</i>

1:56:28.071 --> 1:56:30.449
You can't do it, you know that.

1:56:32.242 --> 1:56:34.244
I do, Father.

1:56:35.204 --> 1:56:37.206
But you don't know how thick she is...

1:56:37.331 --> 1:56:39.917
...how hard it was to train her.

1:56:40.292 --> 1:56:44.213
Other fighters would do
exactly what you'd say to them...

1:56:44.338 --> 1:56:49.843
...and she'd ask, why this and why that,
and then do it her own way anyway.

1:56:50.511 --> 1:56:52.805
How she fought for the title, I....

1:56:52.971 --> 1:56:54.473
It wasn't by anything....

1:56:54.640 --> 1:56:57.643
Well, it wasn't by listening to me.

1:57:06.735 --> 1:57:08.987
But now she wants to die...

1:57:09.196 --> 1:57:11.448
...and I just wanna keep her with me.

1:57:15.786 --> 1:57:19.998
And I swear to God, Father, it's....

1:57:20.499 --> 1:57:23.293
It's committing a sin by doing it.

1:57:23.502 --> 1:57:26.922
By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.

1:57:27.297 --> 1:57:30.300
Do you know what I mean?
How do I get around that?

1:57:31.677 --> 1:57:34.471
You don't. You step aside, Frankie.

1:57:34.680 --> 1:57:36.598
You leave her with God.

1:57:37.307 --> 1:57:40.853
She's not asking for God's help.
She's asking for mine.

1:57:41.019 --> 1:57:44.982
Frankie, I've seen you at Mass
almost every day for 23 years.

1:57:45.190 --> 1:57:47.192
The only person comes
to church that much...

1:57:47.359 --> 1:57:49.027
...is the kind who can't
forgive himself for something.

1:57:49.194 --> 1:57:51.572
Whatever sins you're carrying...

1:57:52.072 --> 1:57:54.533
...they're nothing compared to this.

1:57:54.867 --> 1:57:59.037
Forget about God or heaven and hell.

1:57:59.246 --> 1:58:02.332
If you do this thing, you'll be lost.

1:58:05.794 --> 1:58:08.005
Somewhere so deep...

1:58:09.882 --> 1:58:12.259
...you'll never find yourself again.

1:58:18.432 --> 1:58:20.893
I think I did it already.

1:58:42.748 --> 1:58:46.126
We're keeping her sedated
so she won't try that again.

1:59:51.275 --> 1:59:53.986
I went to see Maggie this morning.

1:59:55.737 --> 1:59:57.739
You must have been somewhere else.

1:59:58.907 --> 2:00:00.784
Yeah.

2:00:04.621 --> 2:00:06.707
You got a fight I don't know about?

2:00:12.129 --> 2:00:14.381
It wasn't your fault.

2:00:14.840 --> 2:00:16.967
I was wrong to say that.

2:00:17.217 --> 2:00:19.178
You're damn right.

2:00:20.554 --> 2:00:21.847
I found you a fighter...

2:00:22.055 --> 2:00:25.601
...and you made her
the best fighter she could be.

2:00:28.187 --> 2:00:29.646
I killed her.

2:00:29.813 --> 2:00:31.690
Don't say that.

2:00:32.024 --> 2:00:34.610
Maggie walked through that door
with nothing but guts.

2:00:34.776 --> 2:00:37.988
No chance in the world of being
what she needed to be.

2:00:38.113 --> 2:00:41.533
A year and a half later, she's fighting
for the championship of the world.

2:00:41.700 --> 2:00:42.951
You did that.

2:00:45.162 --> 2:00:47.706
People die every day, Frankie.

2:00:47.873 --> 2:00:49.750
Mopping floors, washing dishes.

2:00:50.083 --> 2:00:52.044
And you know what
their last thought is?

2:00:52.211 --> 2:00:54.671
"I never got my shot."

2:00:55.172 --> 2:00:57.424
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

2:00:58.717 --> 2:01:02.387
If she dies today, you know what
her last thought will be?

2:01:03.263 --> 2:01:05.599
"I think I did all right."

2:01:13.232 --> 2:01:15.776
I know I could rest with that.

2:01:18.487 --> 2:01:19.530
Yeah.

2:01:20.113 --> 2:01:21.907
Yeah.

2:01:33.001 --> 2:01:34.711
Yeah.

2:02:12.916 --> 2:02:14.376
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

2:02:14.543 --> 2:02:16.003
Yeah.

2:02:42.988 --> 2:02:44.573
All right.

2:02:48.744 --> 2:02:51.246
I'm gonna disconnect your air machine...

2:02:52.122 --> 2:02:54.374
...then you're gonna go to sleep.

2:02:59.087 --> 2:03:01.840
Then I'll give you a shot, and you'II...

2:03:02.883 --> 2:03:04.510
...stay asleep.

2:03:09.848 --> 2:03:11.642
<i>Mo cuishle...</i>

2:03:13.143 --> 2:03:16.772
...means "my darling, my blood."

2:04:24.882 --> 2:04:27.634
<i>He gave her a single shot.</i>

2:04:28.051 --> 2:04:32.264
<i>It was enough adrenaline
to do the job a few times over.</i>

2:04:32.598 --> 2:04:35.476
<i>He didn't want her
going through this again.</i>

2:05:25.317 --> 2:05:27.027
<i>Then he walked out.</i>

2:05:27.653 --> 2:05:30.906
<i>I don't think he had anything left.</i>

2:05:49.508 --> 2:05:51.718
<i>I went back to the gym.</i>

2:05:52.010 --> 2:05:55.681
<i>Waited, figuring he'd turn up
sooner or later.</i>

2:06:15.325 --> 2:06:18.745
<i>And that's when a ghost
came through the door.</i>

2:06:21.290 --> 2:06:24.334
I got to thinking what you said,
Mr. Scrap.

2:06:25.419 --> 2:06:27.045
What was that, Danger?

2:06:28.714 --> 2:06:31.300
Anybody can lose one fight.

2:06:32.551 --> 2:06:34.386
That's the truth.

2:06:35.179 --> 2:06:37.764
Go on, put your gloves on.
You missed a lot of training.

2:06:39.725 --> 2:06:42.227
Will do, Mr. Scrap. Sure thing.

2:07:01.038 --> 2:07:04.166
<i>Frankie never came back at all.</i>

2:07:18.931 --> 2:07:23.060
<i>Frankie didn't leave a note,
and nobody knew where he went.</i>

2:07:23.435 --> 2:07:25.979
<i>I'd hoped he'd gone to find you...</i>

2:07:26.104 --> 2:07:29.149
<i>...and ask you one more time
to forgive him.</i>

2:07:29.274 --> 2:07:32.778
<i>But maybe he didn't have
anything left in his heart.</i>

2:07:32.945 --> 2:07:36.281
<i>I just hope he found someplace
where he could find a little peace.</i>

2:07:36.782 --> 2:07:39.868
<i>A place set in the cedars and oak trees.</i>

2:07:40.244 --> 2:07:43.413
<i>Somewhere between
nowhere and goodbye.</i>

2:07:43.580 --> 2:07:47.167
<i>But that's probably wishful thinking.</i>
