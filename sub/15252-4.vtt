WEBVTT

00:01.260 --> 00:04.550
(Laughter) Okay alrite, You do it Chuck,
Come on, Head in the game, come back time...

00:04.591 --> 00:05.650
How do I like my eggs?

00:06.290 --> 00:08.039
What's up?
Poached.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.130
Yeah, baby!

00:09.840 --> 00:11.030
I don't know why I play
this game with you guys.

00:11.071 --> 00:12.960
- Any day now, buddy, come on...
- Don't rush me, okay.

00:13.240 --> 00:14.690
Oh! Six.

00:15.710 --> 00:17.160
Okay. Easy. Easy.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.140
My all-time favorite pet?

00:19.720 --> 00:20.270
Um...

00:20.311 --> 00:22.180
- Cocker Spaniel...
- Yeah!

00:22.221 --> 00:25.000
- Peaches!
- Oh, who got Peaches?

00:25.490 --> 00:26.340
MORGAN: Wrong.

00:26.890 --> 00:27.550
Incorrect.

00:28.090 --> 00:31.360
It was a Springer Spaniel
named Peaches Two,

00:31.401 --> 00:34.760
not to be confused with Original
Peaches who got hit by a car.

00:34.820 --> 00:36.970
I think we can just give
it to Sarah, Morgan.

00:37.011 --> 00:39.360
Yeah. Yeah,
fine, fine.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.100
I'll just say anything next time
and i'll just take a point.

00:42.141 --> 00:44.110
You told me that the original
Peaches ran away.

00:44.151 --> 00:46.240
She did. She did.

00:46.281 --> 00:47.190
What are you doing, Morgan?

00:48.330 --> 00:51.530
MORGAN: Most humiliating
childhood nickname?

00:51.571 --> 00:53.860
I promised Morgan I would
never say it out loud.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.200
Okay.
Um, Organ.

00:58.710 --> 00:59.770
Oh, boom!

00:59.811 --> 01:01.210
You see what I'm talking about?

01:01.251 --> 01:02.990
What's it say?
What's it say?

01:03.031 --> 01:06.230
Organ! Organ!
Boom! Yeah!

01:06.271 --> 01:06.740
Okay.

01:06.781 --> 01:08.220
Yeah, move me up a spot.

01:08.261 --> 01:09.160
The victory battle.

01:09.201 --> 01:09.920
ELLIE: Keep it moving.

01:10.670 --> 01:11.210
Here we go.

01:11.251 --> 01:13.340
Okay, big money, big money????

01:15.100 --> 01:16.850
Next. Next. Next.

01:16.891 --> 01:19.530
Most dangerous situation ever?

01:22.870 --> 01:23.610
He doesn't know it.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.740
I...
I don't know.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.090
Fixing a flat tire on the side of the freeway?

01:29.131 --> 01:29.850
Good guess.

01:30.770 --> 01:31.820
Sunburn.

01:31.861 --> 01:35.220
I was nine and we were on a family
vacation and my sister and I,

01:35.261 --> 01:38.000
put on baby oil instead of sunscreen.

01:38.041 --> 01:40.820
We ended up looking like
two little blond lobsters.

01:46.390 --> 01:47.840
I know!

01:51.620 --> 01:52.240
Okay.

01:52.281 --> 01:54.220
Most hated person ever?

01:54.261 --> 01:56.650
Ah, it's so easy.
A total gimme.

01:59.970 --> 02:00.780
Harry Tang?

02:01.200 --> 02:02.740
Harry Tang?
Come on.

02:02.781 --> 02:03.600
Guys. I don't know.

02:03.641 --> 02:05.220
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

02:05.261 --> 02:06.450
It's, it's a stupid game.

02:06.491 --> 02:07.620
Well, no, no, hold on a second.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.160
No, no, it's, it's Bryce Larkin.

02:09.201 --> 02:11.050
I mean how could you not know Bryce Larkin?

02:11.091 --> 02:14.900
Dude pretended to be his buddy, sexed up his girl,
and got him kicked out of Stanford.

02:15.330 --> 02:18.660
- If-if Chuck is Solo, Larkin is his Fett.
- Okay.

02:18.701 --> 02:21.360
Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Okay. No point. No point.

02:21.530 --> 02:22.260
Understood.

02:23.550 --> 02:24.250
See you in a bit.

02:24.291 --> 02:25.110
Take your time.

02:31.260 --> 02:32.400
Well, we did great tonight.

02:32.441 --> 02:36.050
Yeah, you know, I like to win,
but, uh, Morgan clearly has an edge.

02:36.091 --> 02:38.970
Yeah, when he started to list off
my favorite thirty-one-derful flavors

02:39.011 --> 02:42.210
of ice cream in descending order,
that was a little much.

02:42.251 --> 02:43.980
Yeah, he's like the Intersect on you.

02:44.021 --> 02:46.120
Yeah. Wish I could access your file,

02:47.840 --> 02:50.020
But the stupid thing
doesn't really work like that.

02:50.061 --> 02:51.690
Well, you could always just ask me.

02:51.731 --> 02:52.770
Really? I...

02:54.090 --> 02:57.550
I... Okay.
Yeah. Um...

02:59.120 --> 03:01.580
Well, I mean, you know,
I know that you and Bryce worked together,

03:01.621 --> 03:05.040
but how close were the two of you exactly?

03:05.540 --> 03:10.800
Uh, well, Bryce was my partner,
but we were never really friends,

03:10.841 --> 03:12.170
if that's what you're asking.

03:12.211 --> 03:15.760
Right. Right. So your relationship,
you'd say, was more like"You,

03:15.801 --> 03:20.150
hey, get that bad guy,"or"Nice judo-chop"or"
How about them Redskins?" Or something like that.

03:20.191 --> 03:22.430
Yeah, well, you know,
when you're undercover,

03:22.471 --> 03:24.830
you're still you,
but the details are different.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.850
Yeah, speaking of details,
there were a couple of

03:26.891 --> 03:28.380
those questions
we could've done better with.

03:28.421 --> 03:29.140
Which ones?

03:30.280 --> 03:31.250
You know those...

03:32.370 --> 03:34.040
Those questions...
The...

03:34.820 --> 03:35.470
Questions.

03:35.511 --> 03:36.760
- The sex questions?
- There you go.

03:36.801 --> 03:39.240
Morgan did well with those, too.

03:39.281 --> 03:41.920
Well, what exactly is our
cover for that topic?

03:41.961 --> 03:44.620
Uh, we're taking it slow.

03:45.320 --> 03:49.210
Right. Yeah.
We're being prudent, aren't we?

03:53.250 --> 03:54.270
Oh, you meant...

03:54.810 --> 03:56.520
Walk Sarah to her car?

03:57.660 --> 03:59.780
Makes sense. I don't...
I don't have a car.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:18.850 --> 05:19.920
I knew it was you.

05:20.610 --> 05:22.290
You always telegraph your punches.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.460
Bloody nose says otherwise.

05:25.501 --> 05:26.480
Your cover?

05:26.860 --> 05:27.520
Carina.

05:27.890 --> 05:28.750
You?

05:28.791 --> 05:29.320
Sarah.

05:29.760 --> 05:30.650
Sarah Walker.

05:30.691 --> 05:34.570
So, Sarah Walker, what
brings the CIA to Los Angeles?

05:34.611 --> 05:38.620
Same thing that brings a
DEA agent like yourself: a job.

05:38.661 --> 05:41.050
Well, whatevert is, it looks boring.

05:42.090 --> 05:43.260
All right, Carina, wt is it?

05:43.301 --> 05:44.870
If you're here, it means
you need something.

05:45.820 --> 05:46.620
A diamond.

05:47.690 --> 05:48.560
Wow, are you, uh...

05:49.100 --> 05:50.310
You looking to settle down?

05:51.280 --> 05:52.720
No, I'm going to steal one.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.420
And you're going to help me.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.540
Well, couldn't you just have called?

06:59.710 --> 07:01.000
Hey, guys.

07:01.041 --> 07:04.580
Guys, did you know that there's an undercover
DEA agent out in the courtyard?

07:04.621 --> 07:05.470
Relax. We know.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.390
Should I go?

07:07.431 --> 07:08.410
GRAHAM: He can stay.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.240
Uh, uh, who, who are they?

07:11.281 --> 07:13.030
Seen but not heard.
. Being debriefed here.

07:13.071 --> 07:17.610
GRAHAM: The diamond is heavily guarded
inside of Peyman Alahi's Malibu compound.

07:17.651 --> 07:18.400
Are they with us?

07:18.910 --> 07:22.730
Alahi is an international
financier for the opium cartel,

07:22.771 --> 07:26.370
which is why the Drug Enforcement Administration
has asked us to cooperate.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.700
You'll assist Carina in acquiring the rock.

07:28.741 --> 07:29.620
- Acquiring?
- Shh.

07:29.661 --> 07:34.800
You'll take Chuck to Alahi's compound to get
his Intersect data on his alarm system.

07:34.841 --> 07:36.740
Set the grab for the following day.

07:36.781 --> 07:41.790
Sir, Carina is a tremendous field agent, but...

07:42.910 --> 07:44.030
We can't trust her.

07:44.071 --> 07:45.270
Chuck is way too valuable.

07:45.311 --> 07:47.860
GRAHAM: Alahi has friends outside the opium trade.

07:47.901 --> 07:51.900
We've received intel that he plans on
moving the stone within the next 72 hours.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.770
I've had dealings with Carina in the past, too.

07:56.690 --> 07:59.010
She could be a bit of a...
Wild card.

07:59.051 --> 08:01.930
We're aware of what
happened in Prague, Agent Casey,

08:01.971 --> 08:04.710
which is why you and Agent Walker
return the diamond to us.

08:04.751 --> 08:07.380
Under no circumstances should
Carina be entrusted with it.

08:07.421 --> 08:08.840
What happened in Prague?

08:10.410 --> 08:12.700
I-I don't...
I don't need to know.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.440
So, this is your team?

08:17.840 --> 08:18.510
My team.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.930
Oh, hello, Casey.

08:21.410 --> 08:23.080
Nice to see you with your pants on.

08:23.930 --> 08:26.210
And, uh, who might you be?

08:27.260 --> 08:29.480
- I'm Ch-Chuck. The new guy.
- Really?

08:29.940 --> 08:30.960
He's an analyst.

08:31.530 --> 08:32.520
MORGAN: Hey, Chuck?

08:33.260 --> 08:34.490
Another member of your team?

08:34.530 --> 08:37.020
Uh, no, that's Morgan, Chuck's best friend.
He's a civilian.

08:37.061 --> 08:40.080
Hey, Morgan, uh, this is my friend Carina.
We used to work together.

08:40.121 --> 08:40.580
Hello.

08:41.350 --> 08:42.299
Madame Carina.

08:44.220 --> 08:46.590
- And I say, "Madame Carina.
- " Right?

08:46.631 --> 08:48.840
And she goes, "A pleasure to meet you, sir.

08:48.881 --> 08:49.990
"But it's her eyes.

08:50.031 --> 08:52.160
Man, her eyes say everything.

08:52.201 --> 08:52.660
Like what?

08:52.701 --> 08:53.660
Like, Martin.

08:54.460 --> 08:57.800
She kind of got my name wrong.
She goes Martin instead of Morgan.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.850
- It's completely fine though.
- Tang's coming.

09:00.380 --> 09:01.440
Okay, gotta go.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.310
Morgan wasn't made to mix with
the opposite gender.
Unlike me.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.680
Chuck, how are you supposed
to get any female friction

09:07.721 --> 09:09.870
action with him third-wheelin'
you althe time?

09:10.340 --> 09:11.350
What does that even mean?

09:12.970 --> 09:13.700
Sex.

09:13.741 --> 09:14.980
Can't you just say that?

09:15.021 --> 09:18.900
Yeah, I mean I could.
It just, it lacks, uh, flavor.

09:20.870 --> 09:24.690
I can guess what Casey's doing here,
but, uh, what about this Chuck guy?

09:24.731 --> 09:26.350
What is he analyzing?

09:26.880 --> 09:27.640
You?

09:28.160 --> 09:30.310
Our cover is boyfriend/girlfriend.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.070
Speaking of.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.070
I'm sorry to hear about Bryce.

09:37.190 --> 09:38.070
Thanks.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.310
It's, uh...

09:40.980 --> 09:41.740
It's been hard.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.360
Of course, getting dead is an
occupational hazard.

09:44.930 --> 09:46.510
So, what's the assignment here anyway?

09:46.551 --> 09:47.760
It's top secret.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.520
So i'll guess i'll just talk to Chuck myself.

09:50.561 --> 09:52.170
That's not happening either.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.330
Hey, Carina, come on.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.480
Carina!

09:58.830 --> 09:59.990
And where do you think you're going?

10:00.031 --> 10:02.330
I need two eyes on the revolving wieners.
Hear me?

10:08.690 --> 10:09.590
Hey, Carina.

10:11.300 --> 10:12.620
Excuse me.
Do you work here?

10:12.661 --> 10:14.460
Oh, uh.
Yeah.

10:14.501 --> 10:16.350
Uh, we met this morning at Chuck's.

10:16.910 --> 10:17.710
Martin.

10:17.730 --> 10:18.830
Oh, right.

10:19.660 --> 10:20.920
Have you seen Chuck?

10:20.961 --> 10:22.000
Chuck?

10:22.540 --> 10:24.780
No, where is he?

10:25.560 --> 10:28.310
Oh, my God, she is way too good for him.

10:28.351 --> 10:30.030
She's too good for this store.

10:30.071 --> 10:33.190
Is there a nicer establishment where
beautiful people can shop?

10:36.310 --> 10:36.990
Hi.

10:42.670 --> 10:44.560
Chuck, you have to fix me up with Carina.

10:44.601 --> 10:45.490
No. I mean...

10:45.531 --> 10:48.680
No, actually, I don't think that's such
a good idea, Morgan.

10:48.721 --> 10:52.010
Chuck, I know what a third wheel is.
I know it's me.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.930
Give, give me a chance here, man.

10:53.971 --> 10:57.090
Let, let me be a fourth wheel for once.

10:57.530 --> 10:58.910
Or maybe like any other even number.

10:58.951 --> 10:59.940
What do you think you're doing here?

10:59.981 --> 11:01.600
I'm just getting to know your team.

11:01.641 --> 11:05.480
If I'm going to trust them with my life
and my diamond, I want to be certain
they're the best.

11:05.521 --> 11:06.080
Wait.

11:07.110 --> 11:08.440
You don't think I'm good enough.

11:08.481 --> 11:09.250
- That's it.
- Yes.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.550
No, no.

11:10.591 --> 11:11.730
I just, uh...

11:11.771 --> 11:14.940
Chuck, if you can get Sarah, man,
that means just about anything is possible.

11:15.770 --> 11:18.190
Let me spread my wings, man.

11:19.910 --> 11:23.420
Fine, fine, i'll see what I can do.
But no promises.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.830
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

11:25.230 --> 11:28.320
Have the girls gotten hotter
around here or is it just me?

11:28.361 --> 11:31.980
Well, this is my op and my rules,
and you're going to do exactly what I say.

11:32.021 --> 11:32.950
We'll see about that.

11:32.991 --> 11:35.790
Sarah, ey?
Sorry to interrupt.

11:35.830 --> 11:38.150
- Hi, Carina. Can I just talk to
you for a second?
- Sure.

11:39.970 --> 11:43.910
anby that I mean,
I need to ask you a favor,
and feel free to say "no,"

11:43.951 --> 11:49.000
say "no," but, uh, could you fix
Morgan up with Carina?

11:51.960 --> 11:55.100
Make sure you really exaggerate
"no" so they can lip-read it.

11:55.141 --> 11:58.120
They're a little lame, but I
think they can crack "no.

11:59.240 --> 12:02.220
- " You know, that is a great idea.
- No, it's not.

12:02.510 --> 12:04.900
"No" is the answer.
You're supposed to say "no.

12:06.710 --> 12:08.170
"Think this thing can pierce
through bone?

12:08.211 --> 12:09.990
Carina, you want my help
with your mission?

12:10.410 --> 12:11.860
I believe those were your orders.

12:11.901 --> 12:14.250
Then I need your help to
protect Chuck's cover.

12:15.060 --> 12:16.390
You're going on a double date.

12:16.950 --> 12:18.000
With Morgan.

12:18.450 --> 12:19.740
Small price to pay.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.410
Which one of these geeks is Morgan?

12:22.690 --> 12:23.530
Green shirt.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.220
Well, that'll be fun.

12:31.140 --> 12:34.130
Easy, girl. Easy, girl.
Easy, take it down.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.600
You guys are so cute, really.

12:39.641 --> 12:41.950
You're, like, the cutest couple ever.

12:42.490 --> 12:43.570
Ah, well...

12:44.060 --> 12:46.830
Thanks, yeah. We're doing...
We're doing good.

12:46.860 --> 12:49.290
Good? I'd say we're doing
very good, sweetie.

12:49.331 --> 12:51.440
Well, I stand corrected.

12:51.630 --> 12:54.230
So, um, how did you two meet?

12:54.900 --> 12:57.890
- At work, I guess. Right, yeah?
- Yeah, work.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.060
MORGAN: Sarah came into the
store with a broken cell phone,

13:00.101 --> 13:02.170
like a modern-day damsel in distress.

13:02.630 --> 13:03.470
I guess you're right.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.610
A lot of people who meet
at work end up dating.

13:09.060 --> 13:12.030
Uh, so do you guys want to watch
a movie or something?

13:12.071 --> 13:13.500
Good idea...

13:14.220 --> 13:15.410
Sweetie.

13:15.451 --> 13:16.700
Yeah, that's a great...

13:16.741 --> 13:18.780
I rented that penguin movie.

13:18.821 --> 13:21.880
No, no, no, no, no... a movie's a terrible idea.
Don't you think?

13:21.921 --> 13:25.470
I think that people don't take enough time
to get to know each other.

13:25.820 --> 13:29.870
All I want to do tonight is find out
everything there is to know about Carina.

13:30.540 --> 13:31.080
Really?

13:31.610 --> 13:32.470
Like what?

13:35.720 --> 13:38.390
Were you always this hot or did you just,
like, recently find your hotness?

13:39.450 --> 13:40.950
You're so cute.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.830
Man, dude, Carina is really into me.

13:47.871 --> 13:49.630
Yeah, it seems that way, doesn't it?

13:49.671 --> 13:50.300
What does that mean?

13:50.840 --> 13:51.510
What?

13:51.551 --> 13:52.940
The way you said that.

13:52.981 --> 13:55.790
"Seems," like, why
wouldn't she be into me?

13:55.831 --> 13:57.210
No, no, no, I'm sure.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.390
I'm sure that she's into you.
Really?

14:02.060 --> 14:05.120
You know, you don't have to be
so hands-on with Morgan.

14:05.161 --> 14:06.340
You said I'm on a date.

14:06.381 --> 14:08.260
This is me on a date.

14:08.301 --> 14:10.790
- You're going to give him the wrong ide
- Oh, come on.

14:10.831 --> 14:12.500
I'm just giving the kid a thrill.

14:12.541 --> 14:14.830
I mean, this place is like...

14:14.871 --> 14:16.350
If a yawn could yawn.

14:17.540 --> 14:18.840
How do you stand it?

14:19.950 --> 14:21.210
I'm good here.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.670
Yeah, right.

14:23.870 --> 14:25.840
Who's up for a hot slice?

14:35.560 --> 14:36.730
Do you like to travel?

14:37.160 --> 14:38.610
Mm-hmm, with someone fun.

14:38.651 --> 14:39.450
Shh! Shh!

14:39.491 --> 14:40.280
You "shh"!

14:41.990 --> 14:42.690
Sorry.

14:44.790 --> 14:45.770
Where were youast?

14:45.860 --> 14:47.830
CHUCK: Argentina, okay?
Now will you shut up.

14:47.871 --> 14:49.430
They're almost at the Antarctic.

14:53.990 --> 14:56.510
Do you want to get out of here and
go to Chuck's room or somewhere private?

15:08.070 --> 15:08.720
Yeah?

15:08.761 --> 15:12.220
MORGAN: Hey, dude, uh, did
Carina call about me yet?

15:12.261 --> 15:13.830
No, Morgan, it's the middle of the night.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.160
She hasn't called yet.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.380
Uh, when do you think
it's cool for me to call her?

15:23.421 --> 15:25.050
I am asleep!

15:25.091 --> 15:28.770
Not true, 'cause here we are talking.

15:29.180 --> 15:30.250
Right?
You know...

15:32.150 --> 15:32.980
Chucky?

15:35.820 --> 15:36.760
Okay, okay, you know what?

15:36.801 --> 15:41.930
Listen, listen, she has not called in the time
that it's taken me to pick up and hang up.

15:41.971 --> 15:43.870
Leave me alone, Organ!

15:47.230 --> 15:48.590
And hello to you too, ma'am.

15:48.631 --> 15:55.520
Yes, I-I am, uh, the on-call Nerd Herder for
all Nerd Herd Computer emergencies.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.420
And-and what is your room number?

16:06.830 --> 16:07.520
Hey, Chuck.

16:10.610 --> 16:11.640
Use your feet.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.380
Where's...

16:15.421 --> 16:16.870
Where's, uh, your computer?

16:17.370 --> 16:18.290
I don't have one.

16:18.940 --> 16:20.180
I lied to get you over here.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.810
Why would you do that?

16:22.851 --> 16:24.030
Because I know you're with us.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.710
Who's "us"?

16:27.751 --> 16:29.040
Who's "with us"?

16:29.810 --> 16:30.930
Oh, thank you.

16:31.660 --> 16:33.220
But no, thank you...

16:33.261 --> 16:38.080
You can't access my file to know
about Argentina unless you
have a G6 clearance or higher.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.230
Cheers to spying.

16:46.330 --> 16:47.780
I hope you like what you see.

16:50.230 --> 16:51.980
I should probably call Sarah.

16:52.021 --> 16:53.360
Sarah should probably be here.

16:53.401 --> 16:55.460
I think that it would be
important for her to know...

16:57.250 --> 16:58.750
You're not much of a spy, are you?

16:59.750 --> 17:03.000
I don't know how many more clues I can...
Take off.

17:04.710 --> 17:09.369
But if Sarah were here,
I couldn't seduce you.

17:10.420 --> 17:14.050
Unless maybe, you're
into that sort of thing.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.780
Just one...

17:19.940 --> 17:24.740
Or maybe I'm wrong, and you're
already sleeping with Sarah.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.680
Are you sleeping with Sarah?

17:30.120 --> 17:32.890
You know that a gentleman never...

17:32.931 --> 17:33.830
Oh, got it.

17:33.871 --> 17:37.740
Well, that makes sense...
Considering Bryce.

17:39.680 --> 17:43.070
Bryce? Bryce?
What are you talking about?

17:43.111 --> 17:44.650
What, you don't know about Bryce?

17:45.760 --> 17:46.860
Bryce Larkin?

17:48.010 --> 17:49.040
Her boyfriend.

17:53.260 --> 17:56.690
We'll go in undercover as party
guests and locate the diamond.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.000
Where's the diamond?

17:58.140 --> 17:59.470
Well, that's your job, Chuck.

17:59.511 --> 18:03.000
The Intersect knew about Peyman Alahi's
connection to the opium cartels.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.210
So you want me to steal the diamond?

18:04.251 --> 18:05.580
No, we'll grab the stone later.

18:05.621 --> 18:08.590
Today, we just get in, we find it,
and we get out. And that's it.

18:09.350 --> 18:10.660
Right, get in, get out.

18:10.840 --> 18:11.440
Got it.

18:11.830 --> 18:12.450
Are you okay?

18:13.020 --> 18:14.070
Yeah, fine, why?

18:14.630 --> 18:15.990
Well, you just seem a little...

18:16.740 --> 18:17.660
I don't know, something.

18:18.470 --> 18:20.390
- Are you sick?
- No, fine.

18:20.750 --> 18:21.710
, one last thing.

18:21.751 --> 18:24.810
At the mansion, I need you to do me
a favor and stick by my side.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.040
Why is that?

18:26.440 --> 18:30.700
Well, Carina, she likes to improvise,
and things can get sticky fast.

18:30.741 --> 18:32.790
She likes trouble, and she looks for it.

18:32.831 --> 18:35.010
You know, one time in Pakistan,
I really had to save her...

18:36.300 --> 18:41.010
Okay, it doesn't matter, but the point is
that Carina is not to be trusted.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.140
Oh, Sarah.

18:45.630 --> 18:48.310
You have no idea how happy
I am to hear you say that.

18:48.710 --> 18:49.780
What is it?
Why?

18:49.821 --> 18:52.420
Well, Carina said something last night...

18:52.461 --> 18:53.250
Last night?

18:53.890 --> 18:54.610
Oh, right.

18:54.651 --> 18:57.690
Uh, well, she put a call in to the
Nerd Herd after-hours number

18:57.731 --> 18:59.180
and I was the one who was on call.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.050
What did she tell you?

19:00.091 --> 19:02.590
Ms. Walker, your break is
abutting the 25-minute mark.

19:02.631 --> 19:04.150
Uh, one second, please.

19:06.140 --> 19:07.040
What did she say?

19:07.570 --> 19:09.140
I mean, it doesn't matter if it's not true.

19:09.181 --> 19:10.720
Just, just tell me.

19:11.660 --> 19:15.160
Something about Bryce and you...

19:15.960 --> 19:17.600
You know, being together.

19:22.100 --> 19:24.790
I'm sure whatever you lovebirds are
discussing is a matter of national security,

19:24.831 --> 19:27.570
but the ketchup vat isn't
just going to refill itself.

19:27.611 --> 19:31.350
Did you know that 55% of
accidents occur in the kitchen?

19:31.391 --> 19:33.950
And I'm sure most of them are accidents.

19:36.230 --> 19:37.420
It's not true, right?

19:38.080 --> 19:40.270
You and Bryce, that's not true, right?

19:42.430 --> 19:44.130
It was complicated.

19:47.050 --> 19:49.230
I thought you were supposed
to be good at lying.

20:02.310 --> 20:03.710
You know what?
This is ridiculous.

20:03.751 --> 20:07.260
I'm buying the next suit.
I can see my own boxer
shorts in my pants.

20:08.810 --> 20:11.410
Well, I think you look very sexy.

20:14.410 --> 20:16.950
Listen, I'm sure Sarah's
warned you about me.

20:17.110 --> 20:19.790
That I improvise, take risks.

20:19.831 --> 20:21.450
Yeah, she might've mentioned
something about that.

20:21.950 --> 20:23.440
Did she also mention my record?

20:23.481 --> 20:25.740
How I took down the
Quintana Gang in Colombia?

20:26.710 --> 20:28.020
So trust me.

20:28.740 --> 20:29.360
Got it?

20:30.710 --> 20:31.410
Great.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.440
Now, see that man over there?

20:34.180 --> 20:39.040
Peyman Alahi, his house, his party,
his diamond... For now.

20:40.420 --> 20:42.960
Are you talking about
Señor Wookie over there?

20:43.490 --> 20:45.210
Just, uh, grab a drink.

20:45.670 --> 20:47.810
- And, uh, look casual.
- Okay, casual.

20:50.150 --> 20:54.150
There's a southern egress with two armed guards
and by the garage exit, three more.

20:55.140 --> 20:58.150
Why did you tell him about Bryce?
You compromised my cover.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.330
We're on a mission here, Sarah.

20:59.371 --> 21:02.180
Try keeping your private life
and work life separate for a change.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.760
Hey, we okay? How are you?

21:06.900 --> 21:09.730
Uh, yeah, I'm cool.
I'm cool.

21:10.200 --> 21:17.370
Um, so I count six SVB-54 explosion-protected
security cameras with infrared surveillance.

21:17.411 --> 21:18.400
Did you have a flash?

21:18.980 --> 21:21.850
No, they sell them at the spy
shop in the Buy More Plaza.

21:27.040 --> 21:27.690
Hey.

21:28.970 --> 21:30.090
You got a light?

21:31.220 --> 21:34.350
You know studies indicate that smoking
can be hazardous to your health.

21:35.190 --> 21:36.350
Pick up a paper...

21:38.890 --> 21:40.110
From the '60s.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.660
Thermal imaging cameras...
north and west walls.

21:48.090 --> 21:50.010
Someone really doesn't want
us getting in there.

21:51.460 --> 21:52.880
Let's go for a little stroll.

21:56.910 --> 22:01.250
CHUCK: So I guess if this were you and Bryce,
you'd be breaking into the bedroom, huh, Sarah?

22:01.291 --> 22:03.250
- Chuck, it's not the time.
- Okay.

22:26.350 --> 22:27.570
Oh, that's awesome.

22:28.570 --> 22:29.670
There you are.

22:30.180 --> 22:32.470
You know, I really think we should go now.

22:32.690 --> 22:34.160
????

22:38.240 --> 22:39.800
So you like my diamond?

22:40.090 --> 22:41.800
Oh... Yeah.

22:41.841 --> 22:43.890
Uh, it's really pretty.

22:43.931 --> 22:45.800
You're not supposed to be here.

22:45.841 --> 22:49.670
Oh, i'm, I'm really sorry,
but the door was unlocked.

22:51.110 --> 22:53.740
And, uh, and who are you?

22:55.180 --> 22:56.530
Pretty girls call me Peyman.

22:56.571 --> 22:58.340
- Hi, Peyman, I'm Carina...
- Hey, Peym...

22:58.381 --> 23:01.640
This is Sarah, and this is our brother Chuckie.

23:02.160 --> 23:02.880
PEYMAN: A brother?

23:04.790 --> 23:06.100
More good news for me.

23:09.020 --> 23:12.840
So, uh, what would I have to do to
get this thing on my finger?

23:12.881 --> 23:16.800
It is said that he who owns the
Nadan-I-Noor rules the world.

23:18.220 --> 23:18.870
So...

23:18.911 --> 23:22.090
What if, like, someone tried to steal it?

23:25.350 --> 23:26.930
It's impossible to steal.

23:28.080 --> 23:32.920
Because if touched, the vault will seal itself off;
the gas will fill the room;

23:32.961 --> 23:37.130
and after that, my security team
would eliminate the threat.

23:44.320 --> 23:48.030
But me, I am more of a lover than a fighter.

23:49.480 --> 23:53.470
Wow, you know, I saw some really
cool paintings outside.

23:53.511 --> 23:54.540
Can I have a look?

23:54.581 --> 23:55.700
PEYMAN: Sure.

23:56.630 --> 23:59.390
- You like this one?
- Oh, yeah.

23:59.430 --> 24:03.420
Oh, you got a nice pair of eyes
amongst other nice pairs.

24:12.620 --> 24:18.530
The guy wearing the fur sweater failed to mention
one fairly significant security detail.

24:18.571 --> 24:19.350
Like what?

24:19.391 --> 24:22.450
20,000 volts of electricity
protecting the stone.

24:22.491 --> 24:24.310
Hmm, problematic.

24:24.600 --> 24:25.830
How you going to fix that?

24:27.560 --> 24:28.860
I'm sorry. You're asking me?

24:28.901 --> 24:31.540
Well, yeah, Sarah told me
you're supposed
to have this really big brain,

24:31.581 --> 24:34.400
so for our follow-up mission,
what do you recommend?

24:34.441 --> 24:36.290
I mean, now that we
know that there's a trap,

24:36.331 --> 24:39.120
I might use compressed
air to knock it off the pedestal.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.720
The dude liked to paint naked girls.

24:41.761 --> 24:43.600
I mean, I can't say I blame him.

24:43.641 --> 24:45.000
Like, like what?

24:45.490 --> 24:46.460
I, I don't...

24:46.501 --> 24:48.270
You know, s-something like...

24:48.311 --> 24:50.040
Oh, th-that, that, that would work.

24:51.110 --> 24:54.670
Carina. Carina!
Carina, what are you doing?

24:54.711 --> 24:55.500
Improvising.

24:57.000 --> 24:57.860
I got it!

25:07.150 --> 25:09.540
- Hey, this was only recon.
- Hey!

25:12.340 --> 25:13.540
Just like Little League.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.340
I got it!
I got it!

25:20.640 --> 25:21.770
????

25:22.390 --> 25:23.510
Ary guys approaching fast!

25:23.551 --> 25:24.830
CARINA: So I made a split-second decision.

25:28.020 --> 25:29.260
I was doing us a favor!

25:29.301 --> 25:30.730
Stop doing me favors!

25:30.771 --> 25:33.090
CHUCK: Excuse me, pardon me!

25:33.131 --> 25:34.710
Your shoulders are looking a little red!

25:34.751 --> 25:35.740
Oh, no, no!

25:39.740 --> 25:40.550
Thank you!

25:40.840 --> 25:43.600
Carina improvised. She snatched the diamond.
Meet us on the beach.

25:43.641 --> 25:44.420
I'm on it.

25:55.480 --> 25:56.900
Hey, Carina, what now?

25:56.941 --> 25:57.860
You two run for it.

25:57.901 --> 25:59.170
Give me the stone.
I'll take the heat.

25:59.211 --> 26:00.330
You can double back and get me out.

26:00.371 --> 26:01.730
What? No, she's lying.

26:01.771 --> 26:03.340
Chuck, trust me.

26:03.381 --> 26:04.890
You... remember what I said.

26:06.380 --> 26:07.190
Yeah.

26:09.540 --> 26:11.220
Which lie are you referrg to?

26:11.740 --> 26:13.470
- Hard to keep track these days.
- ???

26:14.380 --> 26:15.280
Thanks, Chuck.

26:20.550 --> 26:22.400
You planned this?

26:22.441 --> 26:23.640
Catch you later.

26:37.210 --> 26:38.300
Oh, my God.

26:41.280 --> 26:42.060
CASEY: Get in!

26:51.020 --> 26:52.530
I have to be able to trust
you on a mission,

26:52.571 --> 26:55.050
Chuck, no matter how you're
feeling about me personally.

26:55.091 --> 26:58.450
H-How am I supposed to know that Carina
has a remote-controlled Jet Ski?

26:58.491 --> 27:00.140
It's not usually an option in real life.

27:00.181 --> 27:02.930
Our orders were to bring the
diamond in, Chuck.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.440
What is she going to do with it?
Is she going to sell it?

27:05.460 --> 27:06.390
No, she's a gamer.

27:06.431 --> 27:09.320
She'll give it to her bosses,
move up the DEA's covert ranks.

27:12.390 --> 27:14.290
What are you...
What are you doing?

27:14.331 --> 27:17.650
Can't believe I have to work my
stupid hot dog shift.

27:17.691 --> 27:20.490
If I call in sick again, i'll get canned.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.700
- What?
- Don't be mad.

27:31.741 --> 27:33.600
Well, you left us to die.

27:33.641 --> 27:34.920
I knew you'd get out of it.

27:34.961 --> 27:38.550
You're burning a bridge, Carina,
d the CIA is going to have your ass for this.

27:38.591 --> 27:40.870
Well, I got to run.
Thanks again.

27:42.750 --> 27:44.160
You go to work; i'll get the diamond.

27:44.201 --> 27:45.970
- What?
- NSA magic.

27:46.060 --> 27:47.330
I put a trace on her phone.

27:47.371 --> 27:49.310
Wherever she's going, I'm going.

27:52.390 --> 27:53.190
Eyes up front, soldier.

27:53.231 --> 27:55.430
I-I... what are you...
I was looking...

28:04.020 --> 28:04.820
Carina?

28:18.330 --> 28:19.380
Damn it.

28:27.020 --> 28:28.450
- Carina.
- Martin?

28:28.800 --> 28:30.010
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.

28:30.780 --> 28:32.610
I'm so glad i found you here.

28:32.651 --> 28:35.680
Wow, you look... Fantastic.
I just...

28:43.460 --> 28:45.680
I just happened to be in the neighborhood.
This is great.

28:45.721 --> 28:48.070
Look, I'm sorry I didn't call,
but it's just not going to work out.

28:48.111 --> 28:50.100
I've got...
This old relationship thing.

28:50.141 --> 28:51.530
Oh, well, do you want to talk
about it over coffee?

28:51.571 --> 28:53.130
One for each of us.
I'll treat.

28:53.171 --> 28:55.830
I can't. It's just...
It's too soon.

28:59.900 --> 29:01.070
Hello, Casey.

29:04.100 --> 29:05.130
Where's the diamond?

29:05.171 --> 29:08.620
Love the cpetitive spirit, Johnny,
but I don't have the diamond.

29:08.661 --> 29:11.860
I'm not in the mood for any of
your games, Carina.
Give it to me now.

29:11.901 --> 29:14.780
I don't have it, I swear.
If I did, I'd give it to you.

29:16.070 --> 29:17.900
Go ahead.
Look anywhere you'd like.

29:18.680 --> 29:19.720
In fact...

29:20.670 --> 29:22.230
Maybe you should just start with me.

29:36.040 --> 29:36.790
Chuck.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.250
I haven't heard from
Casey in an hour,

29:39.291 --> 29:40.870
so I'm going to Carina's hotel,

29:40.911 --> 29:42.770
and I need you to stay home tonight.

29:42.811 --> 29:43.330
Got it?

29:43.420 --> 29:44.390
You don't want my help?

29:44.431 --> 29:45.410
Not tonight.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.490
So I'm off the team.

29:46.531 --> 29:50.640
No, Chuck, just benched,
but we're going to have to talk
about what happened.

29:54.020 --> 29:55.660
Someone got a headache tonight?

29:55.701 --> 29:57.930
Yeah, yeah, that would be me.

30:02.220 --> 30:03.170
MORGAN: X-Box?

30:03.360 --> 30:04.410
Where's Sarah?

30:04.590 --> 30:05.360
Oh, we had a fight.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.850
You don't want to hear about it.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.260
Fight, huh, man?

30:08.360 --> 30:11.030
That's, like, your first fight.
That's kind of a big deal.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.740
I wonder what our first fight
would have been like.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.690
I mean, I know it's stupid,
but it's Sarah's fault, I think.

30:16.710 --> 30:19.160
I mean, I never would have done it
if she'd just told me the truth to begin with.

30:19.300 --> 30:20.940
You're not even listening to me, are you?

30:21.200 --> 30:21.860
Oh, sorry, man.

30:21.890 --> 30:27.880
I stopped listening when it wasn't about Carina,
like how she kissed me and then dumped me.

30:29.010 --> 30:30.980
Carin... you kissed Carina?

30:32.460 --> 30:35.090
Yeah, man, at her hotel.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.090
On the lips.

30:38.740 --> 30:42.090
But I guess she has some past
relationship or something.

30:42.131 --> 30:43.730
I don't know, man, whatever.

30:45.730 --> 30:46.700
Her loss.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.050
You want another one?

30:50.070 --> 30:52.110
Hells, yeah, I feel a bender coming on.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.990
All right, one grape soda coming up.

30:56.290 --> 30:57.140
Thanks, bro.

30:57.160 --> 30:59.070
Oh, I, uh, got the new
"Stealth Underlords" game.

30:59.111 --> 31:03.000
I was going to surprise Carina,
but that's another thing she'll be
missing out on, so...

31:03.890 --> 31:05.440
If you want to grab it, it's in my bag.

31:05.610 --> 31:06.410
Sure.

31:07.350 --> 31:08.270
Oh, Chuck?

31:08.840 --> 31:10.040
Can I get some more pizza?

31:10.080 --> 31:10.750
'Cause I just...

31:10.790 --> 31:11.870
I'm feeling a little...

31:12.060 --> 31:13.170
Got it.

31:13.730 --> 31:14.630
Hey, Chuck?

31:15.030 --> 31:16.020
Yes, Morgan?

31:16.030 --> 31:16.740
You know what?

31:16.790 --> 31:19.040
If our relationships don't work out...

31:20.110 --> 31:22.850
Okay, 'cause we got each other, don't we?

31:24.490 --> 31:26.190
That's really, really sad.

31:26.380 --> 31:27.390
I know.

31:45.170 --> 31:48.360
Wow, it's, uh, just like Prague, huh?

31:48.570 --> 31:50.920
Hey, that's very, very funny.

31:51.550 --> 31:52.550
What are you doing?

31:53.690 --> 31:54.530
Smile.

32:16.680 --> 32:20.470
He who owns the
Nadan-I-Noor rules the world.

32:26.390 --> 32:27.310
Okay.

32:27.470 --> 32:29.250
Sarah, hey, oh, hey, thank God.

32:29.291 --> 32:30.740
Listen, I-I know that you're
really mad at me right now,

32:30.781 --> 32:33.130
okay, but... wait, you know this is Chuck, right?

32:33.260 --> 32:34.320
Okay, good, good, good.

32:34.390 --> 32:35.640
Okay, listen, listen, the diamond.

32:35.680 --> 32:38.260
The diamond that we stole
from the wooly mammoth...
it is not a drug diamond, okay?

32:38.301 --> 32:41.570
I repeat: it is not a drug
It belongs to an Afghani terrorist group.

32:41.580 --> 32:42.940
Look, I could get into a lot more details,

32:42.981 --> 32:45.300
but the point: it is way more
dangerous than we thought.

32:45.341 --> 32:46.200
Chuck.

32:46.710 --> 32:50.100
Find Carina and tell her to
bring me the diamond.

32:50.950 --> 32:52.240
Please.

32:53.980 --> 32:57.290
Hey, Morgan, buddy, long story,
but I'm going to have to go ahead and step...

32:59.260 --> 33:00.030
Hey.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.980
Listen, go ahead and take
whatever you want. Okay?

33:01.990 --> 33:04.020
I keep a little cash in my sock drawer.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.040
And by little, I mean spare change.

33:06.790 --> 33:07.330
Pizza?

33:07.470 --> 33:08.490
You... Yeah, absolutely.

33:08.500 --> 33:09.110
Help yourself.

33:09.151 --> 33:10.370
It's right behind me on the counter.

33:10.790 --> 33:11.510
This? You want this.

33:11.540 --> 33:12.010
I can't...

33:12.040 --> 33:16.110
I can't actually give you this
because it's not mine to give, really.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.850
Carina?

33:30.270 --> 33:31.580
Fine, it's me.

33:32.470 --> 33:34.150
The mask is so Martin wouldn't ID me.

33:34.230 --> 33:35.420
Now, give me the diamond.

33:35.700 --> 33:36.660
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

33:36.670 --> 33:37.230
I need your help.

33:37.240 --> 33:38.220
Sarah's in trouble.

33:38.260 --> 33:39.080
Sarah's fine.

33:39.090 --> 33:40.400
She's very resourceful.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.700
Now, the rock?

33:41.950 --> 33:42.310
Wait.

33:42.351 --> 33:43.570
So you're just going to
cross your fingers

33:43.611 --> 33:45.350
and hope for the best instead
of helping your friend?

33:45.360 --> 33:46.570
Oh, come on, Chuck.

33:46.580 --> 33:47.740
You know, this thing of ours?

33:47.770 --> 33:49.470
We're all in it for ourselves.

33:49.490 --> 33:51.120
It's what we do.

33:52.090 --> 33:53.310
It's not what Sarah does.

33:56.080 --> 33:56.710
And-And...

33:56.730 --> 33:59.060
And if she would have
thought that in Pakistan,

33:59.440 --> 34:01.740
then you wouldn't be alive right
now to have this conversation.

34:03.780 --> 34:04.650
You want it?

34:04.870 --> 34:05.770
Here you go.

34:06.150 --> 34:08.310
But with or without you,
I'm going to go help Sarah.

34:11.969 --> 34:13.360
Just hold onto it.

34:14.340 --> 34:15.520
In case I change my mind.

34:17.370 --> 34:19.699
MORGAN Dude,
what's the ETA on my pizza?

34:19.860 --> 34:24.750
Uh, uh, buddy, I got to go pick up some more,
and your grape soda's on the kitchen floor.

34:26.550 --> 34:27.770
Who do you work for?

34:28.420 --> 34:29.449
Tiffany.

34:29.690 --> 34:31.690
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.150
You didn't just take that diamond from me.

34:35.120 --> 34:36.730
I was holding it for a friend of mine.

34:37.250 --> 34:39.050
A very grouchy, dangerous friend.

34:39.091 --> 34:40.510
Does he like your new look?

34:41.429 --> 34:46.199
Normally, I don't mind women being rough,
but that was very rude.

34:46.760 --> 34:48.270
Watch the one with the clovers.

34:56.710 --> 34:57.940
CARINA: I don't get it, Chuck.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.820
I thought you and Sarah were on the outs.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.580
I made a mistake.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.820
I'm still getting used to how you guys
need to lie about who you are.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.070
I'm feeling like a knife fight.

35:09.120 --> 35:12.550
You analysts don't know
what it's like for us field agents,
but it's our job.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.670
We shed identities like people shed clothes.

35:14.690 --> 35:16.450
In your case, that's quite often.

35:17.370 --> 35:19.040
Try 'em on, like 'em or leave 'em.

35:19.110 --> 35:20.390
After a while, it doesn't even matter.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.470
So you don't let anyone
know who you really are?

35:23.840 --> 35:24.750
Can't.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.950
Might have to leave them in five minutes,
or shoot them in the head.

35:27.980 --> 35:31.930
Trust me, a spy doesn't want you to
know anything about them that's real.

35:32.450 --> 35:34.050
No matter who you are.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.150
You carry the diamond;
i'll act as intermediary.

35:38.520 --> 35:42.230
And listen, if we're still alive afterwards,
how about we go back to my room?

35:43.640 --> 35:45.670
Kind of stuck back on the still alive part.

36:05.700 --> 36:07.890
Told you smoking could be
hazardous to your health.

36:15.540 --> 36:17.290
Do you have what I want?

36:18.010 --> 36:19.070
Maybe.

36:19.610 --> 36:22.510
Maybe I pawned it for front row
tickets to Justin Timberlake.

36:25.170 --> 36:27.500
Why do you always have
to provoke people?

36:28.840 --> 36:29.970
Show me the diamond.

36:32.850 --> 36:34.180
I have it. I have it. I have it.
It's right here.

36:34.220 --> 36:35.670
I have it in the...

36:36.150 --> 36:37.000
Just... There its.

36:37.140 --> 36:37.790
Here's your...

36:37.950 --> 36:38.910
That's your...

36:38.920 --> 36:40.290
I have it right here.

36:41.620 --> 36:42.240
Now give it to me.

36:42.281 --> 36:43.010
No.

36:43.380 --> 36:45.150
I know that I'm new to this,

36:45.190 --> 36:48.460
but I'm pretty sure that this is
the part where I do what the man says.

36:50.090 --> 36:51.310
He didn't say please.

36:52.670 --> 36:57.310
Now, if you want it so badly,
try taking it away from me.

36:57.470 --> 36:58.770
Look around you.

36:59.010 --> 37:01.560
Everyone in the room is with me.

37:07.170 --> 37:09.880
What are you going to do, fight us all?

37:10.550 --> 37:11.680
All by yourself?

37:11.730 --> 37:13.150
She's not by herself.

37:13.250 --> 37:17.690
- ?????
- ????

37:36.480 --> 37:37.630
Miss.

37:53.540 --> 37:54.260
Got to hide it.

37:54.310 --> 37:54.700
Got to hide it.

37:54.741 --> 37:55.600
Got to hide it.

38:13.620 --> 38:14.150
Wait!

38:14.200 --> 38:14.880
Wait!

38:14.930 --> 38:15.790
Wait!

38:16.240 --> 38:17.230
You know where this goes?

38:17.510 --> 38:18.240
No.

38:18.250 --> 38:21.000
Neither do I, so step back,
or I let it go.

38:23.190 --> 38:24.050
Now what?

38:25.490 --> 38:26.530
You know, I'm not really sure.

38:26.550 --> 38:28.080
I hadn't thought it through that far.

38:40.390 --> 38:41.260
What?

38:41.420 --> 38:42.510
What?

38:51.050 --> 38:55.490
Capturing the Nadan-I-Noor Diamond has
dissolved Peyman Alahi's credibility.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.500
His network has fallen apart.

38:57.650 --> 39:01.720
We were also able to thwart the purchase of
$26 million of surface-to-air missiles

39:01.870 --> 39:04.300
the Afghani terrorist group
was planning on buying.

39:04.320 --> 39:06.680
No diamond, no cash, no sale.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.440
Job well done, people.

39:14.390 --> 39:15.830
You didn't?

39:17.410 --> 39:18.940
Well, this was fun.

39:18.980 --> 39:20.450
Yeah. Good-bye, Carina.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.520
Working with you has been...

39:22.910 --> 39:24.500
Well, let's never do this again, hmm?

39:24.770 --> 39:25.520
Oh, thanks, Johnny.

39:25.640 --> 39:29.950
Maybe next time you can shake it up a bit
and pull the four-leaf clovers out of the rotation.

39:33.230 --> 39:37.750
Well, you know, as much as I hate your methods,
there's never a dull moment, right?

39:37.910 --> 39:40.820
Well, if you want a dull moment,
just check out your cover life.

39:41.560 --> 39:43.530
Well, you know, we have our adventures.

39:43.550 --> 39:44.180
Right.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.180
Oh, uh, dinner tonight so we can talk?

39:47.330 --> 39:48.180
Pizza?

39:48.430 --> 39:49.390
Sounds good.

39:50.990 --> 39:52.860
Sure you don't want to come
back to my hotel room?

39:53.630 --> 39:55.230
Um, as...

39:55.370 --> 40:03.040
As flattered and intimidated as
I am by your proposition, why me?

40:03.530 --> 40:05.790
Well, you're sort of cutish.

40:06.470 --> 40:10.720
But, um, the real reason is,
I love taking what Sarah wants.

40:12.330 --> 40:13.370
What? What? Me?

40:13.460 --> 40:13.920
No.

40:13.930 --> 40:14.520
Sarah...

40:14.530 --> 40:15.630
No, Sarah doesn't want me.

40:15.710 --> 40:18.310
Yeah, she probably doesn't
even know it herself yet...

40:19.950 --> 40:22.550
But, um, I do.

40:43.300 --> 40:44.110
Hey.

40:47.950 --> 40:50.230
Vegetarian with no olives.

40:52.420 --> 40:54.350
It's the only thing I
know about you that's true.

40:54.780 --> 40:56.180
You don't like olives.

40:58.410 --> 40:59.480
Thank you.

41:00.690 --> 41:01.230
Come in.

41:01.271 --> 41:02.390
Thank you.

41:07.010 --> 41:09.490
Look, i'm-I'm sorry about the beach.

41:10.180 --> 41:10.940
You're absolutely right.

41:10.990 --> 41:13.490
I-I shouldn't let my feelings
affect the mission.

41:14.870 --> 41:16.030
And, um...

41:17.980 --> 41:20.470
If you and Bryce... if you had a...

41:21.030 --> 41:23.650
Thing, well, that makes sense.

41:24.210 --> 41:25.850
He always got the great girls.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.420
I just wish I knew something real about you.

41:33.970 --> 41:36.830
Can't you just tell me just one true thing?

41:38.630 --> 41:39.440
Just-Just one?

41:39.490 --> 41:41.140
Like-Like, where did you grow up?

41:41.430 --> 41:45.190
Or-Or if that's too much... and I get it,
I get it... if that's too much, what's your...

41:45.210 --> 41:45.920
What's your name?

41:45.961 --> 41:47.450
What's your real name?

41:51.300 --> 41:52.330
Middle name.

41:52.480 --> 41:53.160
What's your middle name?

41:53.220 --> 41:55.180
Can't you just tell me
your middle name?

42:04.910 --> 42:05.710
I'm going to.

42:06.550 --> 42:08.310
I'll go get the napkins.

42:13.440 --> 42:14.800
It's Lisa.

42:16.420 --> 42:18.240
My middle name is Lisa.
