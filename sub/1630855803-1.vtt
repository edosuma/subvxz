WEBVTT

00:36.746 --> 00:38.164
You brought your camera, right?

00:38.164 --> 00:40.166
That's like asking
if I brought my eyes.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.917
Eyes lie. Cameras don't.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.009
So, there was a struggle.

00:50.009 --> 00:51.177
But how did it end?

00:51.177 --> 00:52.261
Where are they?

00:53.429 --> 00:54.722
- Hmm?

00:55.723 --> 00:57.057
Did you hear that?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.309
The last tour came
and went hours ago.

00:58.309 --> 00:59.477
We're the only ones here.

01:02.188 --> 01:03.606
I really don't like this.

01:04.190 --> 01:05.149
All right, fine.

01:05.149 --> 01:06.609
We'll come back in daylight,

01:06.609 --> 01:08.778
pose as tourists
and slip away from--

01:12.948 --> 01:14.116
What in the...

01:21.457 --> 01:23.751
Come on.

01:45.731 --> 01:46.690
What are you doing?

01:46.690 --> 01:47.775
Eyes lie.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.286
What was that?

01:59.286 --> 02:01.539
And what did it do
with the Justice League?

02:01.539 --> 02:02.957
I don't know, Jimmy,

02:02.957 --> 02:05.209
but it definitely
wasn't natural.

02:05.209 --> 02:07.211
- It was--
- Super natural.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.004
The kind of thing
we bring in Superman

02:09.004 --> 02:10.589
and the league to help us
figure out.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.132
But with them missing--

02:12.132 --> 02:14.051
Who do you call
when your heroes need heroes

02:19.306 --> 02:21.892
Miss Lane?
Lois?

02:21.892 --> 02:23.102
Get your girlfriend
on the phone, Jimmy.

02:23.102 --> 02:25.062
Tell her Metropolis...

02:25.062 --> 02:27.231
Tell her the world needs help.

04:14.672 --> 04:16.966
Wow. Metropolis is beautiful.

04:16.966 --> 04:19.176
We're not in Metropolis yet.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.178
Come on, Freddy. Hit the gas.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.263
Actually, accounting
for wind gradient

04:23.263 --> 04:25.307
and local
meteorological phenomena,

04:25.307 --> 04:28.185
we're already traveling
at the safest speed
science allows.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.104
Can't argue with science, Daph.

04:30.104 --> 04:33.065
Okay,
but it sounded urgent.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.275
Like speaking of urgent,
we haven't stopped

04:35.275 --> 04:37.528
for snacks in over
half an hour.

04:37.528 --> 04:39.279
And I'm not sure
Scooby's full enough

04:39.279 --> 04:40.781
to make it
all the way to lunch.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.283
Oh!

04:43.283 --> 04:46.829
Tell the world I was brave.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.124
Oh, for goodness sake.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.459
Man, now we're talking.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.087
Make sure you ration those.

04:55.087 --> 04:56.714
It's our last box until...

04:59.049 --> 05:00.801
Hey, look.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.221
"Now entering Metropolis,
the city of tomorrow."

05:10.853 --> 05:12.813
Like, judging by
all these old photos,

05:12.813 --> 05:16.567
the city of tomorrow
was a lot nicer yesterday.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.362
I wonder
what could've happened.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.847
- That was Giganta.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.892
Hey, not nice.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.643
No, that's her name.

05:51.643 --> 05:54.855
Giganta, member of
the former Legion of Doom,

05:54.855 --> 05:57.024
a now-defunct gang
of super criminals.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.360
And, like, the first woman
to set foot on the moon.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.446
Yeah, from the Earth.

06:02.446 --> 06:05.032
Do you think
she's the reason we're here?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.200
Uh, no.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.911
She's more dangerous
than mysterious.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.287
Unless you count the mystery

06:10.287 --> 06:12.372
of how she finds shoes
in that size.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.628
Ah, Superman.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.046
Like, wow.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.968
Like, whoa!

06:28.555 --> 06:32.434
You said it, Puddin'. Ha!

06:39.233 --> 06:41.360
- That's the Joker.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.570
The Joker and Harley Quinn.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.739
More Legion of Doom members.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.158
Actually, Harley's
an associate member.

06:48.158 --> 06:51.328
Why do you know so much
about Harley Quinn?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.462
No mystery there either.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.690
- Zoinks.

07:27.156 --> 07:28.615
The Creeper.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.617
Already solved that mystery.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.384
Oh.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.637
And that wasn't
even the Creeper.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.472
That was Solomon Grundy.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.850
We're not just stopping
for any ghoul we see.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.935
Well, that's pretty mysterious.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.634
That was close.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.219
Oh, no. Look.

09:19.309 --> 09:22.104
Oh, man, like, that's gotta be
why we're here!

09:22.104 --> 09:25.941
Kind of a mystery, but still
not exactly our thing.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.693
Hey, there it is.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.369
Wow.

09:41.957 --> 09:46.003
Ah, you can actually smell
the ink on newsprint.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.672
The Daily Planet went
all digital five years ago.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.091
Well, then that's what I smell.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.467
Daphne.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.303
Jimmy.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.138
You haven't changed a bit.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.639
Nope.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.474
Still overdue
for that growth spurt?

09:59.474 --> 10:00.809
Hey, thanks for coming.

10:00.809 --> 10:01.893
Follow me.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.521
Lois Lane, meet--

10:04.521 --> 10:05.605
Hang on.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.069
Editorial, you got incoming!

10:11.069 --> 10:12.321
All right. Thanks, Olsen.

10:12.321 --> 10:13.488
I'll take it from here.

10:13.488 --> 10:14.740
The kitchen's over yonder.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.908
I like my coffee
like I like my stories.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.368
Dark with a twist.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.912
No, no, Lois,
these aren't the new interns.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.164
They aren't?

10:23.165 --> 10:24.249
Hang on, Olsen.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.375
Let me guess.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.418
This is your girlfriend.

10:26.418 --> 10:29.296
What? No, that's Velma.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.339
This is Fred.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.007
Shaggy, Scooby-doo.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.633
- And--
- I'm Daphne.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.469
She's my girlfriend.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.596
-  What?
- Of course.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.348
Sorry, Olsen.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.308
For some reason, I just thought
Velma was more your type.

10:43.685 --> 10:44.936
And who is this?

10:44.936 --> 10:47.564
Oh, uh, we haven't met.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.941
Like, what are you
talking about. That's--

10:49.941 --> 10:53.362
- Velma!
- Ah. Did not recognize you.

10:53.904 --> 10:54.863
Really?

10:54.863 --> 10:55.864
Well, yeah.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.282
Velma wears glasses...

10:57.282 --> 10:59.076
And where'd she go?

11:04.873 --> 11:07.417
Ah, there you are, Velma.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.169
I'm sorry, Jimmy,
but have you been

11:09.169 --> 11:11.213
telling people
you're my boyfriend?

11:11.213 --> 11:12.422
Of course.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.466
We happened to be
at the same camp together

11:14.466 --> 11:15.759
one summer.

11:15.759 --> 11:16.843
When I was nine.

11:16.843 --> 11:20.097
And we were voted
"Best Redhead couple."

11:20.097 --> 11:23.100
That wasn't a real award, Jimmy.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.768
We are being bullied.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.938
Yeah, but we got
through it together.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.606
Well, this is all very weird
and embarrassing,

11:29.606 --> 11:31.024
but the clock's ticking, so...

11:31.024 --> 11:32.609
Why did you call us here?

11:32.609 --> 11:34.653
Oh, right to the question.
No hesitation.

11:34.653 --> 11:37.531
You have the instincts
of a reporter, young lady.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.658
I called you here to help us
solve the mystery of--

11:39.658 --> 11:41.368
Great Caesars ghost!

11:41.368 --> 11:44.538
Ga-- Ga-- Great Caesars ghost?

11:44.538 --> 11:46.581
Like, dude,
a ghost is bad enough,

11:46.581 --> 11:49.042
but the ghost
of a salad. Zoinks!

11:49.042 --> 11:51.503
No. There's no salad ghost.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.797
We called you here because,
as you can see,

11:53.797 --> 11:55.632
Metropolis has gone
positively Gotham

11:55.632 --> 11:57.717
since the Justice League
disappeared a few months ago.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.387
- Disappeared?

12:00.387 --> 12:01.638
Without a trace.

12:01.638 --> 12:02.889
Like an illusion.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.724
Here one minute, gone the next.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.977
Uh, with all due respect,

12:06.977 --> 12:09.771
what is the team of renowned
investigative journalists

12:09.771 --> 12:11.857
need with a gang
of meddling kids?

12:11.857 --> 12:13.567
I'm guessing there's more.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.739
Looks like
some kind of Phantom.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.159
Or Phantoms. Look.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.830
I guess this really is
a Mystery Inc investigation.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.583
And while we'd love nothing
more than to help solve it,

12:29.583 --> 12:31.960
Cheetah's back on the prowl
and Sinestro just attacked

12:31.960 --> 12:33.962
Metropolis Harbor
in a yellow submarine.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.423
With Superman gone,
the breaking news business
is booming.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.633
Sounds like we're on our own.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.428
If half of what I've heard
about you kids is true,
you'll do great.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.181
All you have to do
is unmask this "Phantom."

12:44.181 --> 12:47.934
Then find the Justice League
before all these out-of-control
villains destroy the world.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.645
Great. So, like, no pressure.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.928
Oh, yeah. Haunted.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.679
-  I know.

13:24.679 --> 13:27.057
There's no way you two
are stepping out of the van

13:27.057 --> 13:29.059
for less than five
Scooby Snacks.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.311
But I told you,
we're all out of--

13:33.355 --> 13:34.481
Guys?

13:44.199 --> 13:46.243
Wow. And I was bluffing.

13:49.955 --> 13:52.082
Mark what you want
on the tickets.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.294
Excuse me, ma'am.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.129
We're investigating
the disappearance of
the Justice League.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.257
Those no-good do-gooders?

14:00.257 --> 14:02.133
They could stay disappeared,

14:02.133 --> 14:04.135
as far as I'm concerned.

14:04.135 --> 14:08.473
What? Never heard a bad word
spoke about them heroes?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.183
For years I wanted
their permission

14:10.183 --> 14:12.852
to park my truck here
outside their HQ.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.481
I hope you got more of these?

14:16.481 --> 14:20.110
Lots of hungry tourists
traipse pass here everyday.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.571
But the league said
it "weren't safe."

14:22.571 --> 14:26.533
They said we was trying to keep
the sightseers away.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.910
Ha! Imagine how they'd feel

14:28.910 --> 14:31.746
about the Mayor's fancy
new tour groups.

14:31.746 --> 14:32.831
Tour groups?

14:36.042 --> 14:38.878
The ones that Phantom's
been scaring off.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.255
I should thank him, though.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.215
They run right past my truck,

14:42.215 --> 14:45.969
and, boy, does all that
screaming work up an appetite!

14:45.969 --> 14:49.389
So your business is thriving
since the League vanished?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.391
You got no idea.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.310
Best thing that
ever could have happened.

14:53.310 --> 14:56.146
Now, you boys finished
writing up that order?

14:56.146 --> 14:57.814
Like, not even close.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.151
They'll split one order
of Super Fries, please.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.152
Aww.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.880
Take good care of her.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.715
"Her."

15:23.715 --> 15:24.966
You gotta be
kidding me?

15:24.966 --> 15:26.468
Excuse me?

15:26.468 --> 15:28.261
Of course it's a "her."

15:28.261 --> 15:31.014
I bet "she" has a name, too.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.015
Aa-ha!

15:32.015 --> 15:33.808
I don't see how that is...

15:33.808 --> 15:35.977
Fancy paint, decals galore...

15:35.977 --> 15:37.395
What are these flowers?

15:37.395 --> 15:39.814
Some kind of secret
experimental camouflage?

15:39.814 --> 15:42.651
What? No, it's just
a regular van.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.569
Really?

15:45.362 --> 15:46.571
Oh, baby.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.241
- Hey!
- Sorry, sorry.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.534
It's just...

15:51.534 --> 15:52.827
You don't know
how hard it's been

15:52.827 --> 15:54.829
parking Batmobiles
and Arrowcars

15:54.829 --> 15:56.748
and Green Lantern
Energy Bubbles.

15:56.748 --> 16:00.251
I mean, what's wrong
with normal vehicles?

16:00.251 --> 16:02.087
- Nothing.
- Nothing!

16:02.087 --> 16:04.964
Hey, if you need
atomic batteries

16:04.964 --> 16:06.341
to catch up to a villain,

16:06.341 --> 16:08.426
maybe you're not cut out
for the hero biz.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.844
You got me?

16:09.844 --> 16:11.429
You know, all I hear

16:11.429 --> 16:13.682
is how sad people are
that the League is gone,

16:13.682 --> 16:14.933
but between us,

16:14.933 --> 16:16.518
I couldn't have
planned it better.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.228
Planned it?

16:18.228 --> 16:20.105
Yeah, if I had. Which I didn't.
But maybe did I?

16:20.105 --> 16:22.107
I don't know what I did.
What am I doing right now?

16:22.107 --> 16:23.983
Did I plan it? I didn't.
Maybe I did.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.236
What a great day!

16:26.236 --> 16:28.196
Can I park it now?

16:28.196 --> 16:30.615
Uh, would you mind parking her
in that big, empty space
up front?

16:30.615 --> 16:33.451
You mean,
Wonder Woman space?

16:33.451 --> 16:35.412
It's not empty, but...

16:35.412 --> 16:38.373
But for a regular
van owner like you.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.333
Sure. You know, I can move
some stuff around.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.880
What did he mean, "not empty?"

16:45.880 --> 16:47.006
I don't know.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.258
Strange guy.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.474
- So, uh...
- He's mistaken.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.560
It was camp,
we were just friends.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.644
Let it go.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.327
Hey, what happened to you two?

17:17.412 --> 17:19.080
We took the challenge.

17:19.080 --> 17:22.625
Yeah. Like, eat ten orders
of Super Fries,

17:22.625 --> 17:24.586
get 15 more.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.337
All of them for free.

17:28.757 --> 17:30.467
Huh. That sounds like
a really good deal,

17:30.467 --> 17:33.011
Except you have to
eat them all in one sitting.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.604
Excuse me.
Are you here for the next tour?

17:42.604 --> 17:44.814
Uh, I suppose we are.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.775
Wonderful.
I'm Mayor Fleming.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.193
You probably recognize me

17:48.193 --> 17:50.028
from all the campaign billboards.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.363
Actually, all the billboards
we've seen here

17:52.363 --> 17:54.866
have been painted over
with bright pink polka dots.

17:54.866 --> 17:57.702
Of course. Mad Mod.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.788
Mad Mod?

17:59.788 --> 18:03.458
An art school dropout
with a flair for pastels
and villainy.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.668
Just one of the many
super criminals running amok

18:05.668 --> 18:08.296
in my city ever since
the Justice League disappeared.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.714
That's why we're here.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.801
You're the mystery solvers
Lois Lane told me about.

18:12.801 --> 18:15.637
I'm so glad you've agreed
to help us.

18:15.637 --> 18:18.097
We started offering tours
of the Hall of Justice

18:18.097 --> 18:19.974
not long after
the League vanished.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.476
Has it paid the rent?

18:21.476 --> 18:24.813
Sure, but it's so much more
than that.

18:24.813 --> 18:28.441
Being in these hallowed halls
gives people the hope that,

18:28.441 --> 18:31.486
one day, our heroes may return.

18:31.486 --> 18:35.156
But ever since
this "Phantom" showed up,

18:35.156 --> 18:37.742
fewer and fewer people
want to visit this place.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.995
Not that it was much
of an attraction to begin with.

18:45.875 --> 18:46.960
Mercy!

18:48.002 --> 18:50.505
- Sorry, I was--
- Just do it.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.258
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:53.258 --> 18:54.801
Lex Luthor,

18:54.801 --> 18:57.136
the President
of the United States.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.222
Former president.

18:59.222 --> 19:04.936
Yes. Well, current
billionaire genius CEO
of military contractor

19:04.936 --> 19:07.021
and online dating portal LexCorp.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.356
And this is Rex.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.774
Rex Ruthor?

19:09.774 --> 19:11.442
Rat's right.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.945
Anywho. The Hall of Justice.

19:13.945 --> 19:16.364
Pretty lame destination, yes?

19:16.364 --> 19:18.533
So many times I told Superman

19:18.533 --> 19:21.828
to put in a roller coaster,
animatronics, anything.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.288
Uh, excuse me, sir,

19:23.288 --> 19:26.291
but why don't I remember
your presidency?

19:26.291 --> 19:28.293
It was short, thank goodness.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.587
Oh, Flemmy.

19:30.587 --> 19:33.131
When are you and I
going to stop

19:33.131 --> 19:34.966
all this political bickering

19:34.966 --> 19:36.718
and do something good
for the city?

19:36.718 --> 19:39.262
Luthor, the best thing
you can do for Metropolis

19:39.262 --> 19:40.763
is leave.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.724
Charming. Now.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.310
Have you given my final offer
further consideration?

19:45.310 --> 19:47.103
Offer?

19:47.103 --> 19:49.147
He's been pressuring my office
to seize the Hall of Justice

19:49.147 --> 19:50.481
as abandoned property,

19:50.481 --> 19:52.817
and put it up for auction
where he can get it at--

19:52.817 --> 19:54.360
A steal.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.195
Flem. Listen.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.657
A fleet of LexCorp bulldozers
are rolling up as we speak.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.826
All you need
to do is say the word

20:01.826 --> 20:04.787
and I'll mow down
this miserable mausoleum

20:04.787 --> 20:07.498
of moral mediocrity in minutes.

20:07.498 --> 20:10.668
- Woah.
- Were you trying for that
villainous alliteration

20:10.668 --> 20:12.503
or did that just happen
on its own?

20:12.503 --> 20:14.088
Come on, kids.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.590
The tour's starting.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.509
Be careful.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.595
There's more to fear
within these walls

20:20.595 --> 20:24.098
than phantoms, ghosts
and super ghouls.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.392
- Super ghouls?

20:27.560 --> 20:28.770
Zoinks!

20:32.065 --> 20:33.566
Did you want me
to pull the car up--

20:33.566 --> 20:35.485
Not now, Mercy.

20:35.485 --> 20:36.903
I'm sneering.

20:43.993 --> 20:48.498
And behind these doors,
you'll find the Hall of Justice
Trophy room.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.249
These are just
some of the mementos

20:50.249 --> 20:53.169
collected by the Justice League
to serve as a reminder

20:53.169 --> 20:55.880
of their many years
of vigilance and service.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.094
Nice.

21:07.058 --> 21:10.436
The items in this room
are both precious
and priceless.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.397
Even these empty pedestals?

21:12.397 --> 21:15.900
Well, there were a few
alien artefacts

21:15.900 --> 21:18.403
too sensitive
to leave out for the tour.

21:18.403 --> 21:20.655
Nth metal weapons,
a Mother Box,

21:20.655 --> 21:22.490
the Phantom Zone projector

21:22.490 --> 21:23.950
Phantom projector?

21:24.742 --> 21:25.785
Zoinks!

21:25.785 --> 21:27.245
Oh, It's just the name, Shaggy.

21:27.245 --> 21:29.747
It doesn't have anything
to do with ghosts.

21:29.747 --> 21:31.499
Or projection for that matter.

21:35.670 --> 21:39.257
...it's now safely locked away
in a secure military
facility offsite.

21:41.509 --> 21:45.013
Okay, feel free to explore
and we'll resume the tour
in ten minutes.

21:45.013 --> 21:46.389
Hello, Mayor Fleming.

21:50.601 --> 21:52.020
Shaggy, look.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.272
I'm a Superdog.

21:54.272 --> 21:56.190
Like, cute.

21:56.190 --> 21:59.110
But the only Superdog
I've heard of comes
with extra chili

21:59.110 --> 22:01.195
and the side of more chili!

22:06.617 --> 22:09.412
Hey! Let go!

22:11.456 --> 22:13.041
Has something happened?

22:13.041 --> 22:15.543
Ugh, Lex Luthor just
increased his bid

22:15.543 --> 22:17.211
to purchase
the Hall of Justice.

22:17.211 --> 22:19.589
At this rate, the City Council
may not even bother

22:19.589 --> 22:20.965
putting it up for auction.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.216
Luthor will win.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.135
Luthor always wins.

22:24.135 --> 22:26.054
He didn't win the popular vote.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.139
And Superman always beats him.

22:28.139 --> 22:31.059
I'm sure he and the rest
of the Justice League
are out there somewhere.

22:31.059 --> 22:34.020
And once we solve this mystery
and find them,

22:34.020 --> 22:36.272
imagine how sore they'll be
when they find out

22:36.272 --> 22:38.941
you sold their headquarters
to Lex Luthor!

22:38.941 --> 22:40.526
Oh, I hope you're right.

22:41.486 --> 22:42.320
Holy...

22:42.320 --> 22:43.821
- Jinkies!
- Jeepers!

22:43.821 --> 22:45.198
- Zoinks!
- Uh-oh.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.324
Uh, run?

22:50.244 --> 22:52.413
You heard him,
head for the lobby!

22:56.167 --> 22:57.877
- Shaggy!

22:57.877 --> 22:59.337
Hang on, Scoob!

23:29.826 --> 23:32.995
Hey!
Like, it is a projection. See?

23:34.622 --> 23:36.207
Projections don't do that!

23:50.847 --> 23:52.014
Oh!

24:09.031 --> 24:10.825
- Come on!

24:19.500 --> 24:20.626
Like, man,

24:20.626 --> 24:21.794
you're telling me!

24:37.310 --> 24:39.145
Like, as long as we're quiet,

24:39.145 --> 24:40.813
there's no way
that Phantom will--

24:41.898 --> 24:44.066
Dude, I said quiet.

24:44.066 --> 24:45.526
Wasn't me.

24:45.526 --> 24:47.236
Well, if it wasn't you,
then who?

24:48.279 --> 24:49.363
See?

25:04.170 --> 25:05.504
It's a...

25:09.008 --> 25:10.676
A Superdog!

25:51.050 --> 25:52.635
- Hey, over here!
- Over here!

25:52.635 --> 25:54.011
Come on!

25:54.011 --> 25:56.222
Um, thank you for visiting
the, um...

25:56.222 --> 25:58.474
Aw, never mind.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.812
Hey, has anyone seen
Shaggy and Scooby?

26:02.812 --> 26:04.480
They were right behind us.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.190
We must have gotten separated.

26:06.190 --> 26:09.068
Speaking of getting separated,
you kids better--

26:20.413 --> 26:22.540
Oh, no, we're sealed in.

26:22.540 --> 26:24.083
On the bright side,

26:24.083 --> 26:26.168
so is the Phantom.

26:26.168 --> 26:27.753
That's the bright side?

26:27.753 --> 26:29.338
Aha! Follow me.

26:36.137 --> 26:37.388
Just as I thought.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.140
Really great work, you two.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.142
Yeah!

26:41.142 --> 26:43.602
Locking down the facility
once the civilians
were evacuated--

26:43.602 --> 26:45.980
To make it easier to find
and catch the Phantom.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.481
Huh, what a trap.

26:47.481 --> 26:49.275
It wasn't us!

26:49.275 --> 26:51.360
You think we'd lock
ourselves in with the Phantom?

26:51.360 --> 26:52.445
Uh-uh.

26:58.909 --> 27:00.953
Aw. What a cute pup!

27:00.953 --> 27:03.122
Aw, look at you!

27:03.122 --> 27:05.333
Do you think he got left behind
by one of the tourists?

27:05.333 --> 27:08.252
Hmm. I'd say he looks
more like a stray.

27:08.252 --> 27:12.631
Messy fur, dirty claws,
that hungry look in his eyes...

27:12.631 --> 27:15.092
Shaggy, are we strays?

27:15.092 --> 27:16.719
Yep!

27:16.719 --> 27:19.347
If you two didn't initiate
the lockdown, who did?

27:19.347 --> 27:21.599
You guys,
you're looking at him.

27:21.599 --> 27:22.683
The dog?

27:22.683 --> 27:24.185
Superdog!

27:26.604 --> 27:29.065
Man, that's not all he can do,

27:29.065 --> 27:31.275
he can fly
and he's got heat vision.

27:31.275 --> 27:34.153
It's a stray dog, not Superman.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.781
Well, whoever did it,
they just gave us a leg up

27:36.781 --> 27:39.033
in finding
this so-called "Phantom."

27:39.033 --> 27:42.912
All right,
so if I were a monster,
where would I--

27:50.378 --> 27:53.255
What is it, boy?
Is there something
in the break room?

27:54.632 --> 27:56.801
Sounds like the break room's
already broken.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.135
We'll wait here.

27:58.135 --> 27:59.220
Come on, you two.

28:07.895 --> 28:09.313
Lex Luthor!

28:09.313 --> 28:10.815
- Annoying kids?

28:10.815 --> 28:11.982
Rex Ruthor?

28:18.906 --> 28:20.783
Now that we're all reacquainted,

28:20.783 --> 28:22.493
what are you still doing
in the building?

28:22.493 --> 28:23.577
We're locked down.

28:23.577 --> 28:25.454
I know.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.915
I got separated from my driver
in this labyrinth and--

28:27.915 --> 28:31.168
- And what?
- And I got lost. Okay?

28:31.168 --> 28:33.337
Yes, the great Lex Luthor

28:33.337 --> 28:35.714
finally did what Lois Lane
and Mayor Fleming

28:35.714 --> 28:37.591
have been telling him
to do for years,

28:37.591 --> 28:39.802
he got lost.

28:39.802 --> 28:43.097
Anyway, I got locked in here,
then Rexie he got hungry,

28:43.097 --> 28:45.850
but this infernal machine
won't take my dollar.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.435
You have to flatten it out.

28:47.435 --> 28:49.437
It's perfectly crisp.

28:49.437 --> 28:52.106
The stupid thing
just won't take my dollar.

28:53.441 --> 28:55.401
I had them printed up
when I was President.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.279
They're perfectly acceptable
legal tender.

28:58.279 --> 29:00.698
We can just
give you a real dollar?

29:00.698 --> 29:02.700
No, it's fine.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.118
Been meaning to
field test this anyway.

29:11.959 --> 29:15.212
Oh, don't look at me like that.
I'll pay them back.

29:15.212 --> 29:17.548
Believe me,

29:17.548 --> 29:20.676
if there's one thing Superman
and the Justice League
can expect from me...

29:20.676 --> 29:22.261
It's payback.

29:23.387 --> 29:24.722
Ooh, Chipzees!

29:29.685 --> 29:32.104
Oh, and... I suppose...

29:33.272 --> 29:35.691
if you must... help yourselves.

29:35.691 --> 29:39.320
Like, we thought
you'd never ask, Lex ol' buddy!

29:39.320 --> 29:42.323
Well, I've seen super speed,
but this...

30:03.928 --> 30:05.262
That was fast.

30:05.262 --> 30:07.097
That was Krypto.

30:07.097 --> 30:08.349
Krypto?

30:09.016 --> 30:10.518
The Superdog!

30:18.776 --> 30:21.028
I knew it.

30:21.028 --> 30:24.240
Yes, Superman's best friend.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.367
Imbued with many
of the same powers

30:26.367 --> 30:29.203
and weaknesses
as the Man of Steel.

30:29.203 --> 30:31.455
He must've been left behind
when the League vanished.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.047
I wonder who's been
feeding him.

30:40.047 --> 30:42.466
Like, apparently nobody.

30:42.466 --> 30:45.803
Wow! A real,
live super hero dog.

30:45.803 --> 30:50.766
- Who's a good Superdog?
Oh, he's a good Superdog.

30:50.766 --> 30:51.976
I'd be careful.

30:51.976 --> 30:54.895
Kryptonian fleas
have serrated metal claws

30:54.895 --> 30:57.356
and can live for several
hundred Earth years.

31:07.074 --> 31:10.160
Aw, he misses Superman.

31:10.160 --> 31:14.081
Ugh, join the club.
I miss him every time
I open the fire.

31:15.249 --> 31:16.792
All right,
enough fooling around.

31:16.792 --> 31:18.627
We have to look for clues.

31:18.627 --> 31:21.589
Good idea.
I think I saw the word
"kitchen"

31:21.589 --> 31:24.967
- on the directory in the lobby.
Scoob and I will--
- And Krypto.

31:24.967 --> 31:28.846
Right, Scoob and I and
our bodyguard Krypto
will start there.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.767
Oh, look. [chuckles] One left.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.942
Oh, hey, there's another one
under my shoe.

31:45.362 --> 31:46.780
Lucky me.

31:46.780 --> 31:47.865
Let's go, guys.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.285
You know, if you're both good,

31:51.285 --> 31:53.704
I might just let you share
in the bounty.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.877
And since you're so good
with tech Mr. Luthor,

31:59.877 --> 32:02.880
why don't you join me
in the Command Center
to go over the Hall's

32:02.880 --> 32:04.965
closed-circuit
security camera footage?

32:04.965 --> 32:08.218
I know what's happening.
You just want to keep
an eye on me.

32:08.218 --> 32:10.471
But the joke's on you.

32:10.471 --> 32:13.390
I happen to love closed-circuit
security camera footage.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.476
Race you to it!

32:15.476 --> 32:19.855
They're gonna be a handful.

32:19.855 --> 32:25.569
So, what, it was like a...
some kind of "co-ed"
summer camp?

32:25.569 --> 32:26.654
Fred.

32:30.491 --> 32:32.785
- Faster than a speeding bullet?

32:32.785 --> 32:35.829
- More powerful than
a locomotive?

32:35.829 --> 32:37.831
Vulnerable to Kryptonite?

32:39.750 --> 32:42.378
Wow! Just like Superman.

32:42.378 --> 32:45.089
Hey, here it is, "Kitchen."

32:47.049 --> 32:49.593
Now, trust us, Krypto,
clues can be hiding anywhere.

32:49.593 --> 32:54.181
Even inside a freshly-made
Superhero Sandwich.
Isn't that right, Scoob?

32:54.181 --> 32:56.600
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:59.353 --> 33:01.021
Uh-oh, it's locked.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.910
We're in.

33:14.910 --> 33:18.372
Oh, man, I hope it's
the biggest, coolest
super-sized kitchen ever!

33:19.748 --> 33:21.208
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

33:21.208 --> 33:24.128
- Huh?

33:27.881 --> 33:28.882
Whoa.

33:45.399 --> 33:50.571
Like, this is... super!

33:50.571 --> 33:54.742
It's got everything!

33:57.661 --> 34:01.707
Well, everything except
for triple-cream-salted-
organic- truffle butter!

34:01.707 --> 34:02.791
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

34:05.502 --> 34:07.421
Wait, there it is.

34:10.007 --> 34:13.260
You know, Scoob, when we first
got to Metropolis,
I was worried.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.511
Me too.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.680
There were
supervillains everywhere.

34:16.680 --> 34:18.182
Giganta...

34:18.182 --> 34:19.641
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

34:19.641 --> 34:22.853
...Joker, Harley Quinn...

34:22.853 --> 34:24.813
<i>Acknowledged.
Acknowledged.</i>

34:26.106 --> 34:27.733
...even those
Kryptonian exiles.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.360
<i>General Zod,
Ursa and Non?</i>

34:30.360 --> 34:32.154
That's right.

34:32.154 --> 34:35.032
<i>Acknowledged,
Acknowledged, Acknowledged.</i>

34:42.206 --> 34:44.708
- Wait, not now, Krypto.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.210
Where was I, oh, yeah,

34:46.210 --> 34:50.839
it was really scary
and dangerous.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.049
-  <i>Acknowledged.</i>

34:59.890 --> 35:02.768
Oh, dear, excuse me.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.812
You're excused.

35:04.812 --> 35:07.439
I have to say,
I now feel as comfortable,
safe and secure as--

35:21.119 --> 35:24.414
It's just strange that
you never mentioned
him before, that's all.

35:24.414 --> 35:27.251
I can't believe
you're not letting this go.

35:27.251 --> 35:29.962
Seriously, was it serious?

35:29.962 --> 35:31.839
I'm ignoring you.

35:31.839 --> 35:34.216
Is red hair your thing,
is that it?

35:34.216 --> 35:35.968
Ha!

35:35.968 --> 35:38.220
Well, I don't see how laughing
at me is going to help.

35:38.220 --> 35:42.140
Fred, nothing happened
between me and Jimmy Olsen.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.018
Phew!

35:45.018 --> 35:49.690
Even though he is a fiery
red-haired risk-taker. Like me.

35:49.690 --> 35:52.526
And I mean,
he is Superman's pal.

35:52.526 --> 35:55.195
You know, I...
I have considered
dyeing my hair.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.705
Hold the phone.

36:04.705 --> 36:05.956
Is that...

36:05.956 --> 36:08.625
A genuine Batman Utility Belt.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.794
Fred, we know Batman.

36:10.794 --> 36:13.213
It's not like you haven't
seen one up close.

36:13.213 --> 36:18.135
Well, sure, but he'd never
in a million years
let me try it on!

36:18.135 --> 36:22.931
Freddy, put that back!
It's full of Bat-gadgets
and who knows what else.

36:22.931 --> 36:24.975
It could be dangerous.

36:24.975 --> 36:30.397
So you're saying, I'm taking
a risk just by wearing it?

36:30.397 --> 36:33.358
Ha, I bet ol' Jimmy Olsen
wouldn't do this!

36:33.358 --> 36:37.529
Official, dangerous Bat-gear!

36:37.529 --> 36:42.534
So,
talk about a risk, eh, Daphne?

36:42.534 --> 36:44.703
You are ridiculous.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.204
Wouldn't that be

36:46.204 --> 36:48.957
"dangerously ridiculous?"

36:48.957 --> 36:50.792
Would you stop?

36:50.792 --> 36:52.294
We have to look for clues.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.391
I'm vengeance!

37:06.391 --> 37:07.392
Freddy!

37:07.392 --> 37:09.478
I am the night!

37:09.478 --> 37:10.562
Freddy!

37:10.562 --> 37:11.980
I am...

37:17.653 --> 37:18.737
My hero...

37:18.737 --> 37:20.155
Oh, come on.

37:26.662 --> 37:27.746
A calculator?

37:32.834 --> 37:34.002
Loose change?

37:35.921 --> 37:37.547
Laundry chute. Come on.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.348
Where have you two been?

37:46.348 --> 37:48.850
I was trying to find
a cell phone signal.

37:48.850 --> 37:50.519
No luck, by the way.

37:50.519 --> 37:54.189
This lockdown doesn't
mess around and, well uh...

37:54.189 --> 37:55.774
You got lost again.

37:55.774 --> 38:00.278
No, I was temporarily
under-routed.

38:01.113 --> 38:02.489
So, "lost."

38:05.117 --> 38:07.536
What are you doing
with all this anyway?

38:07.536 --> 38:09.955
I'm attempting to hack into
the Hall's computer system,

38:09.955 --> 38:11.873
so we can review
the logged security footage.

38:13.709 --> 38:16.503
Oh, right.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.463
I meant to tell you
this earlier...

38:18.463 --> 38:23.051
Ha! You think you can just
hack into Justice League
computers?

38:23.051 --> 38:25.512
Sweetheart, if that were
possible, don't you think,

38:25.512 --> 38:28.974
by now, I,
former President Lex Luthor,

38:28.974 --> 38:30.767
billionaire genius,
would have--

38:30.767 --> 38:32.060
I'm in...

38:32.060 --> 38:33.937
Sweetheart.

38:33.937 --> 38:37.065
Hmm, several incidents over
the past month of Helen,

38:37.065 --> 38:39.317
the food truck lady,
sneaking into the building.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.904
But she did say she likes
the bathrooms here.

38:42.904 --> 38:46.199
And that must be
the valet attendant
that Freddy mentioned.

38:46.199 --> 38:48.285
Hey! That's my limo.

38:48.285 --> 38:49.786
Speaking of...

38:49.786 --> 38:51.913
My driver? When was this?

38:51.913 --> 38:55.709
This is actually live footage.
She's in the building
right now.

38:55.709 --> 38:59.004
Mercy? She must have been
locked in like the rest of us.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.338
And she has my bag.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.506
Thank goodness!

39:01.506 --> 39:03.925
Daddy just found
Rexie's nom noms.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.636
What was that?

39:06.636 --> 39:08.221
Sounds like Shaggy
and Scooby are in trouble.

39:11.850 --> 39:12.893
What happened?

39:12.893 --> 39:16.063
Locker room...

39:16.063 --> 39:19.441
laundry chute...
terrible, loud screeching...

39:19.441 --> 39:20.692
From the Phantom?

39:20.692 --> 39:23.862
No, from you!
The whole way down.

39:24.613 --> 39:26.698
Oh, yeah, sorry.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.034
I think we landed
in the parking garage.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.911
But on what?

39:30.911 --> 39:32.621
Freddy, don't look.

39:35.624 --> 39:37.626
Oh, my gosh, Daphne!

39:37.626 --> 39:40.003
I might really be Batman.

39:40.003 --> 39:43.799
Hey! What're you doing
on Wonder Woman's
Invisible Tank?

39:43.799 --> 39:45.050
Invisible Tank?

39:45.926 --> 39:48.053
Oh. Invisible Tank.

39:48.929 --> 39:50.388
Invisible Tank.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.974
Yeah. Right between
her Invisible Plane

39:52.974 --> 39:55.477
and her lesser-known
Invisible Trolley.

39:55.477 --> 39:57.729
Now, if you were aiming
for the laundry truck,

39:57.729 --> 40:00.482
I'm afraid I moved it
to make room for your van.

40:00.482 --> 40:02.567
How are we going to get down?

40:02.567 --> 40:05.570
Let me see,
what would Batman do?

40:06.488 --> 40:07.489
I know!

40:12.244 --> 40:13.745
Jeepers, Fred!

40:20.544 --> 40:22.504
Ah, it's air freshener.

40:24.506 --> 40:26.091
I'll get the ladder.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.281
Scooby-Doo, hang in there!

41:02.127 --> 41:03.086
Yikes!

41:09.009 --> 41:10.468
There's got to be
another way out.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.554
Like, where did
these guys come from?

41:14.639 --> 41:17.976
Hey, Superdog, like, we could
use some little help over here.

41:21.938 --> 41:24.900
<i>Acknowl...</i>

41:25.525 --> 41:26.818
Ruh?

41:28.570 --> 41:32.741
Like, dude, have I lost it,
or did we just magically
transport to...

41:34.117 --> 41:36.453
<i>Acknowleg...</i>

41:36.453 --> 41:38.330
-  Huh?
- The Daily Planet?

41:38.330 --> 41:41.833
Oh, no, I think my life
is flashing before my eyes.

41:43.335 --> 41:45.337
...nowle...

41:52.928 --> 41:54.429
Like, wait a second,

41:54.429 --> 41:56.681
what if this is all just--

41:56.681 --> 41:58.308
Holograms?

41:58.308 --> 42:02.270
Huh? Dude, I was gonna say
"indigestion."

42:02.270 --> 42:04.689
How'd you get...

42:04.689 --> 42:07.275
"Danger.
You are entering
The Justice League

42:07.275 --> 42:10.278
holographic training
simulator, AKA,

42:10.278 --> 42:11.613
the kitchen."

42:11.613 --> 42:13.782
Huh? Holograms!

42:13.782 --> 42:16.201
Like, was that sign there
the whole time?

42:17.702 --> 42:21.414
All right, no need to shout.

42:21.414 --> 42:24.125
Well, if these guys are just
holographic simulations,

42:24.125 --> 42:26.294
all we have to do
is reprogram the...

42:27.879 --> 42:30.757
Zoinks! it's fried!
We're doomed!

42:33.426 --> 42:35.387
Oh, no!

42:35.387 --> 42:37.555
You said it, Scoob!
Like, there's only
one thing left to do.

42:50.610 --> 42:52.821
- There you are!
- You're all late.

42:55.657 --> 42:59.077
No matter! Still plenty of time
to complete our tour of
beautiful Centennial Park.

42:59.077 --> 43:03.415
My name's Norville
and I'll be your docent,
if you think that's decent,

43:03.415 --> 43:07.252
anyone who doesn't
can voice their dissent.

43:07.252 --> 43:10.171
Nobody? Good.
Let's get started.

43:10.171 --> 43:11.840
Thank you, Docent Scoobert.

43:11.840 --> 43:14.676
Remember, folks, the T-shirts
aren't just for fashion,

43:14.676 --> 43:17.345
they're how we keep a headcount
to ensure we end the tour

43:17.345 --> 43:20.348
with the same number of
paying customers we start with.

43:20.348 --> 43:24.269
But don't worry, we've never
lost more than two
or three guests.

43:27.856 --> 43:30.358
Yeah,
they're not all gems.

43:30.358 --> 43:34.738
Okay, we've got our T-shirts
and we're ready to begin
our walking tour

43:34.738 --> 43:39.075
of these historic grounds
on this super sunny day,
but first...

43:39.075 --> 43:43.955
How about a cool drink of
delicious, locally-sourced,
sparkling mineral water?

43:43.955 --> 43:46.499
Hold still.

43:46.499 --> 43:49.502
Hydration,
ladies and gentlemen, it's good
for the soul and for the skin!

43:49.502 --> 43:53.089
You'll all thank us tomorrow,
especially that pale,
handsome fella

43:53.089 --> 43:54.799
with the million-dollar smile.

43:54.799 --> 43:57.886
He's talking about you.

43:57.886 --> 44:00.096
Now if you'll follow us,

44:00.096 --> 44:03.308
we'll begin our tour
with the famed
Centennial Park Sludge Pits,

44:03.308 --> 44:05.268
just behind those trash cans
over there.

44:05.268 --> 44:07.896
We're walking, we're walking.

44:12.150 --> 44:13.151
Ooh.

44:15.612 --> 44:19.908
Yes, the views are spectacular,
please feel free to capture
the memories

44:19.908 --> 44:24.579
and don't forget to tag
all your photos with our
#CheapoTours

44:25.330 --> 44:26.664
Oh.

44:28.416 --> 44:30.794
Now hold on there,
let us help you
find your light.

44:31.836 --> 44:33.296
Ah, much better.

44:41.096 --> 44:42.013
Hey!

44:49.979 --> 44:53.149
Like, that ought to keep them
busy, right, Scoob, ol' buddy?

44:53.149 --> 44:55.193
Yeah!

44:55.193 --> 44:57.028
How go the repairs,
Krypto, my man?

44:58.530 --> 45:00.156
<i>Acknowledged!</i>

45:06.287 --> 45:08.123
Velma!

45:08.123 --> 45:10.959
Scooby! Shaggy! Are you okay?
We heard the commotion.

45:10.959 --> 45:13.753
A holographic simulator?

45:13.753 --> 45:17.507
See, this is the kind of
attraction I was talking about.

45:17.507 --> 45:18.967
Money in the bank!

45:18.967 --> 45:20.385
<i>Identify.</i>

45:20.385 --> 45:23.471
I'm Lex Luthor!
Does no one know?

45:30.228 --> 45:32.939
This just keeps
getting better.

45:34.816 --> 45:36.192
What's this?

45:36.192 --> 45:38.403
<i>D-d-d-displaying archive.</i>

45:38.403 --> 45:39.904
<i>Krypto Collar Cam,</i>

45:39.904 --> 45:43.783
<i>Time Index, March 15,
17:40 hours.</i>

45:43.783 --> 45:45.827
Archive?

45:45.827 --> 45:48.413
Security footage from
a camera housed in
the guard dog's collar.

45:48.413 --> 45:50.832
From the night
the Justice League vanished!

45:50.832 --> 45:53.084
This could be
very enlightening.

45:58.173 --> 46:00.008
I think he wants us
to follow him.

46:00.008 --> 46:01.092
Let's go.

46:03.094 --> 46:04.429
Sounds like trouble all right!

46:09.017 --> 46:10.351
Superman.

46:14.230 --> 46:15.940
Run boy, take cover, go!

46:26.743 --> 46:29.787
Look man,
there's something
behind that tapestry.

46:29.787 --> 46:31.372
The Phantom?

46:31.372 --> 46:35.043
Why would a Phantom need
to hide behind a tapestry?

46:36.377 --> 46:38.630
This is a holographic recording,

46:38.630 --> 46:42.884
unless Krypto's camera
saw them there that night,
we won't see them here.

46:42.884 --> 46:43.968
Krypto?

46:49.724 --> 46:51.518
Aw, we'll find him.

46:51.518 --> 46:55.188
Unless he has
something to say about it.

47:02.070 --> 47:05.532
Computer, delete
Solomon Grundy program.

47:05.532 --> 47:08.159
<i>Solomon Grundy
is not running.</i>

47:08.159 --> 47:10.453
- Oh, yes, he is.

47:10.453 --> 47:12.080
And, like, so are we.

47:19.170 --> 47:20.838
Why is everybody running?

47:20.838 --> 47:23.758
Because one of the holograms
wasn't a hologram.

47:23.758 --> 47:24.968
Holograms?

47:33.017 --> 47:34.727
Lex! There you are! I've been--

47:34.727 --> 47:36.688
We're running, Mercy.

47:38.898 --> 47:40.900
Oh, okay.

47:40.900 --> 47:43.111
Uh, ma'am, can I help you
with the bag?

47:43.111 --> 47:44.946

51:30.588 --> 51:32.673
All right, no one panic.

51:32.673 --> 51:35.760
Grundy may look like
nothing more than
a mindless brute,

51:35.760 --> 51:39.806
but, I assure you,
everyone has their price.

51:41.766 --> 51:45.019
Why won't
anyone take my money?

51:53.236 --> 51:56.364
He's got them both!
Somebody do something.

51:56.364 --> 51:57.448
I know.

52:02.745 --> 52:03.663
Huh?

52:06.707 --> 52:10.419
I need to have a talk
with Batman about this belt.

52:16.425 --> 52:19.637
- Grundy's vanished.
- You don't think...

52:19.637 --> 52:21.597
No, I don't.

52:21.597 --> 52:24.350
Nope, I don't think so.

52:24.350 --> 52:27.520
-  Nope, definitely not.
Dream on.
-  Not a chance, man.

52:29.230 --> 52:30.273
Still...

52:30.273 --> 52:34.360
Thank goodness,
we're all safe!

52:46.122 --> 52:48.666
Dude, how many of
these guys are there?

52:48.666 --> 52:50.293
This is the end.

52:50.293 --> 52:52.545
I danced with Jimmy Olsen
one time at summer camp.

52:52.545 --> 52:54.922
It was the big goodbye party
and no one would dance with him

52:54.922 --> 52:56.632
and I felt bad

52:56.632 --> 52:58.217
and it obviously meant
more to him than it did to me

52:58.217 --> 52:59.969
and if we really only have
a few seconds left,

52:59.969 --> 53:03.764
I couldn't live my last moments
as a fraud!

53:10.646 --> 53:12.732
Jimmy Olsen? Huh.

53:13.399 --> 53:14.984
Uh, guys?

53:25.411 --> 53:27.538
Daphne, if we get out of this,

53:27.538 --> 53:29.123
I'll understand
if you want to...

53:37.131 --> 53:38.215
Huh?

53:42.386 --> 53:43.679
They disappeared.

53:43.679 --> 53:46.307
As mysteriously
as they appeared.

53:46.307 --> 53:47.934
They're not the only ones.

53:49.769 --> 53:51.687
Like, the Phantoms have Mercy!

53:51.687 --> 53:52.855
Have Mercy!

53:52.855 --> 53:55.191
She's never around
when I need her.

53:55.191 --> 53:57.526
You just can't get
good help these days.

53:58.486 --> 54:00.112
Without her messenger bag?

54:00.112 --> 54:02.031
She's been lugging
this heavy thing--

54:02.740 --> 54:03.699
That's odd.

54:03.699 --> 54:04.784
What is it, Velma?

54:04.784 --> 54:06.035
It's empty.

54:06.035 --> 54:07.119
Empty?

54:07.119 --> 54:08.829
All my stuff was in there.

54:08.829 --> 54:09.914
What stuff?

54:09.914 --> 54:11.624
Never you mind.

54:11.624 --> 54:14.251
Well, whatever it was,
it's gone now.

54:14.251 --> 54:16.045
Along with your ride home.

54:16.045 --> 54:18.589
We can drop you somewhere
when this is all over.

54:18.589 --> 54:19.799
I do have a van.

54:19.799 --> 54:22.134
Does it have active camouflage?

54:22.134 --> 54:24.470
No, it's... it's a regular van.

54:24.470 --> 54:27.515
Well, then, what's the point?

54:27.515 --> 54:29.475
What's the point
of any of this?

54:29.475 --> 54:31.936
Why am I trapped in here
with a bunch of kids

54:31.936 --> 54:35.272
when I have military-grade
bulldozers outside right now,

54:35.272 --> 54:37.900
ready to bring
this infernal building
to the ground?

54:37.900 --> 54:39.402
That's it.

54:39.402 --> 54:41.362
What's what?

54:41.362 --> 54:43.781
I was this close
to figuring out
the solution to the mystery,

54:43.781 --> 54:46.867
but there was one tiny piece
of the puzzle out of place.

54:46.867 --> 54:49.662
President Luthor, you just
knocked it into place.

54:51.706 --> 54:54.250
I have to take this. Excuse me.

54:54.250 --> 54:55.918
But Velma called me
"President."

54:55.918 --> 54:57.169
Everybody heard it.

54:57.169 --> 54:59.005
No takesies-backsies.

54:59.005 --> 55:00.423
Where have you been?

55:02.049 --> 55:04.301
All right,
now that Lex is gone,

55:04.301 --> 55:06.721
we can get to the bottom
of this Phantom business,

55:06.721 --> 55:09.223
and find out what happened
to the Justice League.

55:09.223 --> 55:11.684
All we need
is the perfect trap.

55:11.684 --> 55:13.102
Say no more.

55:21.110 --> 55:22.611
Like, seeing as
Superman's counting on us,

55:22.611 --> 55:24.697
anyone got a better idea?

55:26.365 --> 55:28.617
I think he's trying
to tell us something.

55:28.617 --> 55:29.869
What is it, Krypto?

55:40.546 --> 55:43.591
Yes, I got lost again!

55:43.591 --> 55:45.301
And before anyone makes jokes,

55:45.301 --> 55:48.471
I'll remind you, I have
a wristwatch-disintegrator.

55:48.471 --> 55:51.557
Ha! You're very good
with science and technology,

55:51.557 --> 55:52.933
aren't you, Luthor.

55:52.933 --> 55:55.644
How do I put this
so you'll understand?

55:55.644 --> 56:00.107
"Golly, gee, Fred,
you betcha! Jimpies!"

56:00.107 --> 56:01.567
It's "jinkies."

56:01.567 --> 56:04.070
Do I look like I care?
Now, up, up, up.

56:05.112 --> 56:07.782
All right, what's the plan?

56:07.782 --> 56:09.325
Are we building a trap, or not?

56:09.325 --> 56:11.410
My driver is missing!
Look how upset I am.

56:11.410 --> 56:13.120
Uh, there's no need for a trap.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.122
Krypto figured it all out.

56:16.832 --> 56:19.126
The Justice League was
called away for an emergency.

56:19.126 --> 56:20.377
That's all.

56:20.377 --> 56:21.962
And what about the Phantoms?

56:23.297 --> 56:24.799
Swamp gas.

56:24.799 --> 56:28.844
Swamp gas!

56:28.844 --> 56:31.680
That's the most
ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

56:31.680 --> 56:33.432
And I saw Superman,
the musical.

56:35.476 --> 56:37.478
Turns out there's
no real mystery here.

56:37.478 --> 56:40.106
So they won't be
able to sell you
the Hall of Justice after all,

56:40.106 --> 56:41.857
it's safe for tourists
to come back.

56:41.857 --> 56:43.984
Mayor Fleming's on her way
with a group now.

56:43.984 --> 56:45.069
Let's go!

56:55.538 --> 56:57.164
I just got off the phone
with Fleming.

56:57.164 --> 56:59.375
She didn't say
anything about this.

56:59.375 --> 57:01.794
What about Mercy and Grundy?

57:01.794 --> 57:03.129
Eh, they'll turn up.

57:03.129 --> 57:05.506
They probably got lost.
Like you.

57:09.135 --> 57:11.178
This makes no sense.

57:11.178 --> 57:14.640
What about the food truck lady?
And the valet?

57:14.640 --> 57:16.183
Their stories checked out.

57:16.183 --> 57:18.394
Well, I would have liked
to have been consulted.

57:18.394 --> 57:19.937
Well, golly gee, Lex,

57:19.937 --> 57:21.981
you're not really
part of our team, are ya?

57:37.538 --> 57:39.331
<i>And here they are now!</i>

57:39.331 --> 57:41.250
<i>The kids of
Mystery Incorporated</i>

57:41.250 --> 57:43.711
<i>and their pal,
Krypto the Superdog!</i>

57:54.013 --> 57:56.140
We had a deal, Fleming.

57:57.808 --> 57:59.768
Nothing to say?

57:59.768 --> 58:01.854
I sure hope
you're right about this.

58:09.111 --> 58:12.198
Now let's see
who the Phantom really is.

58:13.908 --> 58:15.492
Lex's driver?

58:16.327 --> 58:17.328
Mercy!

58:19.622 --> 58:21.165
You're letting her get away.

58:23.417 --> 58:24.501
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

58:36.305 --> 58:37.681
Oh, nuts!

58:40.726 --> 58:42.937
It was a trap!

58:42.937 --> 58:47.316
Would somebody please
explain what's going on?

58:47.316 --> 58:50.736
Everyone get comfortable.

58:50.736 --> 58:54.907
Mercedes "Mercy" Graves,
personal assistant, driver
and bodyguard to Lex Luthor--

58:54.907 --> 58:57.117
I already know all that.

58:57.117 --> 58:58.619
But do you also know

58:58.619 --> 59:02.248
just how tired I am
of being all of that?

59:02.248 --> 59:04.458
Of carting
your ungrateful rear end

59:04.458 --> 59:05.751
from this board meeting

59:05.751 --> 59:07.920
to that red carpet
charity mixer?

59:07.920 --> 59:10.297
Can you just put me down
for two minutes while
I do this part?

59:11.590 --> 59:12.675
Thank you.

59:12.675 --> 59:13.926
Where was I?

59:14.510 --> 59:16.178
Uh, yes.

59:16.178 --> 59:19.223
Do you know how it
feels to, every night,

59:19.223 --> 59:22.142
see the flashbulbs light up
for you, Lex,

59:22.142 --> 59:24.228
then immediately go
dark for me?

59:24.228 --> 59:28.565
That was paparazzi you were
supposed to keep away from me!

59:28.565 --> 59:31.735
I wanted them to see me, Lex.

59:31.735 --> 59:34.822
And not just as the chauffeur
of the man who started,

59:34.822 --> 59:37.658
and then dissolved,
The Legion of Doom!

59:37.658 --> 59:40.202
That was purely
a business decision.

59:40.202 --> 59:41.912
Exactly.

59:41.912 --> 59:43.664
Somewhere, Lex Luthor,

59:43.664 --> 59:45.833
between the Legion of Doom
and the White House,

59:45.833 --> 59:48.168
- you lost your edge.
- Ha!

59:48.168 --> 59:50.379
Look at you.

59:50.379 --> 59:53.924
- Paying back the Justice League
for a few bags of chips?

59:53.924 --> 59:55.592
How do you know about that?

59:55.592 --> 59:58.345
I see everything, Lex.

59:58.345 --> 01:00:00.639
Which is how I knew

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:05.019
which of our LexCorp-run
military storage facilities
the Mayor sent this to!

01:00:05.019 --> 01:00:07.187
The Phantom Zone projector.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:11.317
With it, I could do something
Lex Luthor never could.

01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:14.320
Step 1, make
the Justice League disappear!

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.865
Step 2, move into
their precious Hall of Justice

01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:21.285
and convert it into a new
supervillain headquarters!

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:25.456
Run by me,
and with free snacks.

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:28.042
Like, where do we sign up?

01:00:28.042 --> 01:00:30.294
Guys, supervillains?

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:32.838
Daphne, snacks!

01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:35.174
Yoink! A passable plan,

01:00:35.174 --> 01:00:38.052
but then the tour groups
started coming.

01:00:38.052 --> 01:00:41.138
Mercy knew she'd never
have the place to herself,

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:44.141
so she used the projector
on a low setting

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:46.352
to create an illusion
of Phantoms

01:00:46.352 --> 01:00:48.896
haunting the old, abandoned
Hall of Justice.

01:00:48.896 --> 01:00:51.523
Which terrified the tourists
and sent them running.

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:53.275
Every time Mercy
brought you to the Hall

01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:55.069
<i>for your meetings
with Mayor Fleming,</i>

01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:57.279
<i>she'd sneak away and hide,</i>

01:00:57.279 --> 01:01:00.032
<i>then turn on
the Phantom projector
and scare people off.</i>

01:01:00.032 --> 01:01:03.327
But what about
when Solomon Grundy
got hold of the dogs?

01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:05.621
When she thought
the dogs were in danger,

01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:07.581
<i>she used the projector
on Grundy,</i>

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:09.333
<i>sending him into
the Phantom Zone,</i>

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.418
thus saving Scooby and Krypto!

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:15.297
Wouldn't have figured that out

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:18.300
if you hadn't accidentally left
your empty messenger bag
at the scene--

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.221
the same bag you've been
hauling this baby around
in for months.

01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:26.141
So if the projector sent Grundy
to the Phantom Zone,

01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:27.810
then that means...

01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:30.729
The "illusion" of the Phantoms
wasn't just an illusion.

01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:32.272
It was the Justice League

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:34.024
trying to break out
of the Phantom Zone

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:35.984
where Mercy imprisoned them.

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:38.278
And that means,
we can bring them back.

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:39.530
- Yoink.
- Hey!

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:41.698
Everybody step back!

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.075
What are you doing, Luthor?

01:01:43.075 --> 01:01:45.202
What I've been
planning all along.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.745
Evil.

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:48.956
And I'm really,
really good at it.

01:01:52.584 --> 01:01:55.170
Did you think I, Lex Luthor,

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.424
hadn't figured out the solution
to this mystery months ago?

01:01:58.424 --> 01:02:00.509
What are you saying, Lex?

01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:03.846
I'm saying, "Well done, Mercy."

01:02:03.846 --> 01:02:06.932
I'm saying I'm proud
of your ingenuity,

01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:08.767
if not your treachery.

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:10.394
That's right!

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.396
I've been two steps ahead
of you from the beginning!

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:15.899
Which is, frankly,
very on-brand for me.

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.609
- But I let you have your fun

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:20.821
as long as it got the Mayor
to sell me this land.

01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:24.950
Which she agreed to do earlier,
on the phone,

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:27.911
when you were busy setting this
admittedly brilliant trap.

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:30.539
It was Krypto's plan.

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:35.335
Diabolical. Any chance you'll
switch sides and work for me?

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.173
Eh, Superman said
the same thing.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.343
Land, kids.

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:46.513
When I was six years old,
my father said to me--

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:47.806
- Uh, get out!

01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:50.809
Ha! Ha!

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:53.187
Before that, he said,

01:02:53.187 --> 01:02:56.023
"Son, stocks may rise and fall,

01:02:56.023 --> 01:02:59.109
utilities and transportation
systems may collapse.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:03.071
People are no dang good,
but they will always need land

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:05.532
and they'll pay through
the nose to get it!

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:08.619
- Remember," my father said--
- Rand.

01:03:08.619 --> 01:03:10.996
That's right. Rand.

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:12.539
I mean, land!

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:16.919
This land,
the former Hall of Justice

01:03:16.919 --> 01:03:20.297
and site of the future
tallest building in the world,

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.883
- the all new LexCorp Tower.

01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:31.725
Jimpies! This room
needs windows.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:33.852
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:40.943
Much better.

01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:42.402
- Thank you.
-  <i>Don't mention it.</i>

01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:49.159
Bulldozers?

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:51.620
See, this is my point, Lex.

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:54.289
You're not having
evil fun anymore.

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:55.374
Oh, no?

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:15.269
Robot Demolition Squad?

01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:17.229
Kryptonite powered.

01:04:17.229 --> 01:04:22.985
And I have no intention
of paying anyone
for those Chipzees.

01:04:22.985 --> 01:04:25.779
Oh, Lex, you're back!

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:27.573
Baby, I never left.

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:38.166
Get off, you mangy mutt.

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:41.545
<i>Initiate defense sequence.</i>

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:43.797
Rex Ruthor's a robot.

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:44.881
Ruh-roh.

01:05:00.314 --> 01:05:02.649
We have to get that projector
away from Lex.

01:05:22.044 --> 01:05:23.503
Where's Freddy?

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:24.880
He left the Utility Belt.

01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:44.858
Shaggy! Scooby!

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:07.714
Yikes!

01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:10.425
Oh, no.
A Kryptonite heart!

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:34.366
Wow, Daphne. You'd make
a pretty good Wonder Woman.

01:06:34.366 --> 01:06:37.703
I prefer Batman.
You're more of a Wonder Woman.

01:06:37.703 --> 01:06:38.787
I wish.

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:48.255
Woah!

01:06:56.805 --> 01:06:58.306
It's Fred.

01:06:58.306 --> 01:07:00.225
Is that an invisible tank?

01:07:02.394 --> 01:07:05.188
If not, it's got a lot
of firepower for a trolley.

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:10.610
Yee-haw!

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:16.450
Oh, hey. Don't yell into
the invisible headset, J.B.

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:17.993
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

01:07:17.993 --> 01:07:19.911
I just never knew I could
love my job this much!

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:21.329
Me, neither.

01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:22.456
Helen?

01:07:50.317 --> 01:07:52.027
Woah.

01:07:52.027 --> 01:07:54.780
Never ever let anybody say
I don't protect my customers!

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.407
Dude, this is one heck
of a food truck.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:06.625
Say, Scoob, is that making
you as hungry as it is me?

01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:09.961
Not now, Shaggy.
But, yes.

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:12.380
Huh? Woah.

01:08:25.811 --> 01:08:28.230
- Hey!

01:08:28.230 --> 01:08:31.233
I see you're still weak
from the Kryptonite.

01:08:37.489 --> 01:08:39.950
Uh-oh. I know that look.

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:43.745
Ow. Ow. Ow.

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.426
They just keep coming!

01:09:44.306 --> 01:09:46.266
-  Here.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.060
Then we'll keep fighting.

01:09:50.312 --> 01:09:51.313
Woah!

01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:02.991
I've gotta have something here
that can help.

01:10:02.991 --> 01:10:04.075
We do.

01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:06.912
Fetch, boy!

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.141
That's it, Rexie. Fetch!

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:29.851
Fetch for me.

01:10:32.354 --> 01:10:33.271
Go, Krypto!

01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:34.731
Go, Rex!

01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:45.742
Oh, no! Rex's Kryptonite heart!

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.723
- What? How?

01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:11.893
Maybe the only thing stronger
than a Kryptonite heart...

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:13.269
is a Kryptonian one.

01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:17.399
Ugh. You're fired.

01:11:22.654 --> 01:11:25.115
Woah, Krypto. All right.

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:33.623
Krypto! Oh, yes!
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:39.337
Nice!

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:48.638
- Only one thing left to do.

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:05.989
Good boy.

01:12:10.869 --> 01:12:13.580
Lex Luthor, what have
you done now?

01:12:22.589 --> 01:12:26.509
Well, League, it looks like
we've got another villainous
scheme on our hands.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:27.844
Jinkies!

01:12:36.186 --> 01:12:37.479
Super-duper.

01:12:37.479 --> 01:12:40.315
Well, gang,
another mystery solved.

01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:41.691
Nice work.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:43.318
You kids just took down
former President

01:12:43.318 --> 01:12:45.487
and current dirtbag,
Lex Luthor.

01:12:45.487 --> 01:12:49.824
And, like, don't forget
dirtbag-in training,
Mercy Graves!

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:50.950
Can I get a quote?

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:53.161
It was the perfect plan.

01:12:53.161 --> 01:12:55.371
And I would have
gotten away with it, too,

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.582
if it weren't for these
meddling kids!

01:12:57.582 --> 01:13:00.335
- And the dogs.

01:13:00.335 --> 01:13:01.711
Write that down.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.755
Hey, what about Solomon Grundy?

01:13:03.755 --> 01:13:05.590
Wasn't he part of
the Legion of Doom?

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:07.592
Shouldn't he be
handcuffed, too?

01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:09.385
I don't think Grundy's part
in all of this

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:11.846
had anything to do
with doom and destruction.

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:14.099
He was just trying
to make a new friend.

01:13:14.099 --> 01:13:15.391
Look.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:20.605
Solomon Grundy
pet you on Monday,

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:23.566
pet you on Tuesday,

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:26.611
- pet you on...
- Shaggy, help!

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:29.697
Woah, woah, woah.
Everybody back in line.

01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:32.200
Eh, no cutting. No cutting.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.369
- Shaggy!

01:13:34.369 --> 01:13:36.538
Sorry, scooby. Business is up

01:13:36.538 --> 01:13:38.957
and Shaggy and I
got an arrangement.

01:13:38.957 --> 01:13:43.211
Like, dude, one for you,
two for me.

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:56.057
So, Daphne, now that
this is all over...

01:13:56.057 --> 01:14:00.562
Oh, Jimmy. I'm sorry,
but I only want to be friends.

01:14:00.562 --> 01:14:02.939
That's just
what I was gonna say.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:06.234
Honestly, I feel like
you've been holding me back.

01:14:06.234 --> 01:14:07.819
I've...

01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:11.531
Wait, you're breaking up
with me? We weren't even--

01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:13.700
There, there, Daphne,
let it all out.

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:15.076
Freddy's here.

01:14:15.702 --> 01:14:17.287
Ugh.

01:14:17.287 --> 01:14:19.747
Well, you did
a great job, kids.

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:22.167
- You'd all make
terrific reporters.

01:14:22.167 --> 01:14:24.169
Clark, where have you been?

01:14:24.169 --> 01:14:27.338
Just got back from a top-secret
overseas assignment, Jimmy.

01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:29.382
I sure hope I didn't miss
anything exciting.

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:32.427
What are you talking about?
You were just here--

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:35.221
Uh.

01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:37.182
I mean, uh.
Yeah.

01:14:37.182 --> 01:14:38.516
Whatever you say, Clark.

01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:41.477
My glasses.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:43.938
I, uh, can't see
a thing without my glasses.

01:14:46.733 --> 01:14:48.318
- Oh.

01:14:54.741 --> 01:14:55.950
Fries.
