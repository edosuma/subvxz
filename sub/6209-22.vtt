00:02.901 --> 00:04.733
You think maybe she's dead?

00:05.261 --> 00:08.221
- Forget it. This is totally impossible.
- You've got to be patient.

00:08.382 --> 00:10.181
Turning yourself into fire,
water and wind

00:10.342 --> 00:12.255
is one of the hardest things
a witch has to learn.

00:12.743 --> 00:15.656
For me, it was learning
when to say no to pie.

00:15.823 --> 00:18.294
Listen, stop thinking
about how bad it feels to get it wrong,

00:18.464 --> 00:21.299
and start thinking about how good
it's gonna feel when you get it right.

00:21.465 --> 00:24.379
Okay, I'll try again,
but this time if my legs go numb,

00:24.546 --> 00:28.063
I want help getting off the bed
not just pointing and jeering.

00:28.867 --> 00:31.543
Concentrate.
You are no longer a physical being.

00:31.708 --> 00:34.223
You are a fluid entity.

00:34.388 --> 00:35.425
You are water.

00:36.989 --> 00:38.822
Hey, I did it.

00:39.510 --> 00:40.911
Yes, you did.

00:41.070 --> 00:43.905
And it only took you four weeks.

00:44.072 --> 00:47.702
Am I the only one thinking we should
have purchased some rubber sheets?

[CHUCKLES]

01:12.759 --> 01:14.671
Oh, no. I knew this day would come.

01:14.839 --> 01:16.718
Zelda, there's no music.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.273
Westbridge High just hired me

01:19.441 --> 01:22.275
to be their new
substitute chemistry teacher.

01:22.442 --> 01:24.195
But teaching's so frustrating for you.

01:24.362 --> 01:27.401
Didn't you once storm out in the middle
of a class and never come back?

01:27.563 --> 01:30.443
Yes, but that was only because
they kept asking questions.

01:30.603 --> 01:32.038
And anyway,
that was a long time ago.

01:33.045 --> 01:34.798
Gosh,
I wonder what happened to them.

01:36.525 --> 01:40.600
Do you think Professor Spellman
forgot about us?

01:41.046 --> 01:44.085
Let's give it
another five minutes.

01:45.168 --> 01:47.638
SABRINA: Good morning.
- Good morning, Sabrina.

01:47.808 --> 01:51.485
Guess who's going to be
your new substitute teacher. Me.

01:51.649 --> 01:53.242
Great. You know,
fitting in is hard enough

01:53.410 --> 01:55.242
without someone
calling me sweet pea.

01:55.411 --> 01:58.005
I thought I was the only one
you called sweet pea.

01:58.171 --> 02:00.164
Look, it'll only be
for a couple of weeks.

02:00.332 --> 02:02.801
Mr. Melena might get out of ICU
today.

02:03.492 --> 02:05.848
Do you think sea-monkeys
make good pets?

02:06.013 --> 02:07.892
If you like low maintenance.

02:08.053 --> 02:10.775
How long would it take to hop
across the world on your tongue?

02:10.934 --> 02:13.574
Oh, I don't know,
about six or seven--

02:13.734 --> 02:16.694
Oh, yeah. This is a much
better use of your time

02:16.855 --> 02:18.689
than studying
for your elements test.

02:18.857 --> 02:20.576
For you.

02:20.737 --> 02:22.535
An invitation? To what?

02:23.297 --> 02:25.494
MAN'S VOICE: <i>You are cordially
invited to enjoy high tea</i>

02:25.658 --> 02:28.572
<i>at the 753rd annual
quizmaster-pupil social.</i>

02:28.739 --> 02:30.332
<i>Parking free with validation.</i>

02:30.500 --> 02:31.775
Cool. Sounds like fun.

02:31.939 --> 02:33.375
It's got to be better than last year.

02:33.540 --> 02:36.375
The highlight was a piÃ±ata.
I'll pick you up this afternoon.

02:36.541 --> 02:39.216
Today? I can't go today.
I have a million things to do.

02:39.381 --> 02:42.296
Sorry. Attendance is mandatory.

02:42.462 --> 02:45.422
You know, every once in a while
you could try bringing good news.

02:45.583 --> 02:48.419
A new Pollo Loco
just opened up by my apartment.

02:48.584 --> 02:50.178
I meant good news for me.

02:50.785 --> 02:51.775
ZELDA:
Hi, Sabrina.

02:51.946 --> 02:54.905
Funny how you know my name
and we are in no way related.

02:55.066 --> 02:57.263
Hey, Sabrina, your aunt's here.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.225
You just had to tell everyone,
didn't you?

02:59.387 --> 03:00.582
Well, are you nervous?

03:00.747 --> 03:03.343
Oh, no,
I'm feeling very confident.

03:03.507 --> 03:06.626
My lesson is prepared.
It's clear, concise.

03:06.789 --> 03:10.419
These students are gonna learn
like they've never learned before.

03:10.830 --> 03:14.507
Thereby creating the redox reaction.

03:14.671 --> 03:17.710
So let's solve that problem.

03:20.313 --> 03:26.072
So when you add the copper
to the nitric acid, what will happen?

03:28.155 --> 03:34.313
Then Mr. Copper Man
marries Mrs. Acid.

03:36.197 --> 03:39.794
And they go on their noxious gas
honeymoon.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.629
You have a question?

03:43.799 --> 03:46.713
The bell rang ten minutes ago.
Can we go now?

03:48.760 --> 03:51.798
I can't believe you don't know how
to turn yourself into fire and wind yet.

03:51.961 --> 03:53.681
The test is in three days.
If you don't pass

03:53.841 --> 03:55.242
you won't get your witch's licence.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.122
You've mentioned that to me,
oh, 5,000 times.

03:58.283 --> 04:00.640
- I can turn myself into water.
- Anybody can do that.

04:00.803 --> 04:01.873
You see that waiter there?

04:02.044 --> 04:04.321
Those aren't cocktails,
that's a tray full of students.

04:04.484 --> 04:06.555
Ohhh. I don't wanna know
what the crab cakes were.

04:06.725 --> 04:09.366
Good the head quizmaster doesn't
know you don't know your elements.

04:09.526 --> 04:12.200
- I'd be dead meat.
- It's all about you.

04:12.366 --> 04:15.200
You know what your problem is?
Other students focus on getting it right.

04:15.368 --> 04:17.325
You focus on how
you don't wanna get it wrong.

04:17.488 --> 04:20.367
Wow, how does it feel to be the most
brilliant person in the universe?

04:21.288 --> 04:23.521
You'd think it'd pay more.

04:26.050 --> 04:27.450
Is there an exit in here?

04:27.610 --> 04:30.604
Well, each of those chairs
has a swirling vortex.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.366
I gotta get away from my quizmaster

04:34.532 --> 04:36.763
or as I like to call him,
"If-Evil-Had-a-Face."

04:36.933 --> 04:38.845
Is that an Indian name?

04:39.253 --> 04:40.813
Having trouble
on your elements test?

04:40.974 --> 04:44.331
Yeah. I can't concentrate. I mean,
my quizmaster keeps lecturing me.

04:44.495 --> 04:46.487
Really? They're supposed
to make it fun, not hard.

04:46.655 --> 04:48.807
- Which one is he?
- The one dressed like a rodeo clown

04:48.976 --> 04:51.253
that keeps shoving tea cakes
in his mouth.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.090
So you can see why I wanna leave.

04:53.257 --> 04:55.056
You're supposed to stay
for the whole thing.

04:55.218 --> 04:56.971
Besides, I hear there's a door prize.

04:57.138 --> 04:58.892
Yeah, I saw it. It's actually a door.

04:59.859 --> 05:01.737
Well, some people think
that expansion

05:01.899 --> 05:04.813
has diluted the quizmaster
talent pool.

05:06.381 --> 05:10.456
Or maybe there's just a certain type
of person drawn to the job.

05:12.462 --> 05:14.978
Sabrina, there was a student
who turned herself into fire

05:15.143 --> 05:17.295
while drinking the glass of water.
That was incredible.

05:17.463 --> 05:18.898
Darn, it's amazing
the things you miss

05:19.064 --> 05:20.896
when you're desperately
trying to avoid you.

Hi, everyone.

05:22.224 --> 05:23.864
I just wanted to thank you all
for coming,

05:24.026 --> 05:27.258
and tell you that I'm so pleased
to see such a great turnout today.

05:27.426 --> 05:29.384
- Who's that?
- That's the head quizmaster.

05:29.547 --> 05:32.427
I think her official title
is "the person who can fire your butt."

05:32.588 --> 05:33.703
But she's so young.

05:33.868 --> 05:36.862
Yeah, she looks pretty good for 600.

05:37.028 --> 05:39.385
You okay, Sabrina?
You're whiter than usual.

05:39.550 --> 05:41.621
Oh, no. I'm just sick, very, very sick.

05:41.790 --> 05:44.943
In fact, we should go before I do or say
something that makes me sicker.

05:45.110 --> 05:46.671
Hello again.

05:46.832 --> 05:47.822
You two know each other?

05:47.992 --> 05:49.472
- Yes, we've--
- We've never met.

05:49.632 --> 05:52.864
You must be thinking of my evil twin,
but usually she's a brunette. Heh.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.068
Quizmaster 72469,

05:55.234 --> 05:58.272
are you aware that Sabrina
is very unhappy with your teaching?

05:58.434 --> 06:01.712
Well, she's in high school.
She's unhappy with everything.

06:01.876 --> 06:04.266
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

06:04.437 --> 06:07.475
Sounds like someone ate the tapioca
pudding way past the expiration date.

06:07.637 --> 06:10.915
Effective immediately, you are
terminated as Sabrina's quizmaster.

06:11.077 --> 06:12.876
- What? Bu--
- That will be all.

in this realm?

Thank you for listening, Salem.

students to understand this chemistry.

It just really helps
to talk about it out loud.

- Hi, honey. How was your tea?
- Pretty average, you know.

06:35.244 --> 06:38.158
There was music, little sandwiches,
tea, of course.

06:38.325 --> 06:40.124
Oh, and I got my quizmaster fired.

06:40.926 --> 06:43.760
- What kind of sandwiches?
- What happened?

06:44.127 --> 06:46.438
Oh, nothing. I inadvertently
said terrible things about him

06:46.607 --> 06:49.362
to a complete stranger
who turned out to be his boss. Ha.

06:49.528 --> 06:51.485
It's really kind of funny
when you think about it.

06:54.129 --> 06:55.644
I don't get it.

Was the quizmaster angry?

06:57.370 --> 06:59.090
I wish. He was hurt.

06:59.251 --> 07:01.321
Aunt Zelda, what am I gonna do?
I have to fix this.

07:01.492 --> 07:04.087
Well, the Witches' Council
has jurisdiction over the quizmasters.

07:04.253 --> 07:06.050
So you're gonna have to talk
to them.

07:06.532 --> 07:09.002
Good. Maybe I can explain things
and get my quizmaster back.

07:09.174 --> 07:10.767

07:11.054 --> 07:13.205
Oh. That's not a joke either.

07:14.895 --> 07:17.126
And so I'm really sorry
the whole thing ever happened.

07:17.295 --> 07:20.289
It's totally my fault.
I'm completely to blame.

07:20.456 --> 07:22.653

something weird in the punch.

07:25.458 --> 07:26.938
- No.
- Why?

Miss Spellman, you explained
how you got your quizmaster fired,

07:30.579 --> 07:32.775
but you never explained
why you need him back.

You're not seriously gonna teach him,
are you? I mean, look at him.

- He's obviously a troublemaker.
- You heard the judge.

But we can fight it. I mean,
I said I was sorry. Don't do this.

- Great. Have a nice life.

- Yeah.

I'm so at peace with what's happened
between me and the quizmaster.

08:31.715 --> 08:33.547
I believe everything happens
for a reason.

08:33.715 --> 08:36.356
And that's why
we call this stage "denial."

Hi, sweetheart.
How you feeling today?

08:40.236 --> 08:42.594

hasn't had the decency to call me

Welcome, anger.

08:51.600 --> 08:55.197
Hey, I bet that's a letter from him.
Get to the real grovelling parts.

08:55.362 --> 08:57.319
No, it's from the Witches' Council.

08:57.482 --> 08:59.600
It says they're temporarily
out of quizmasters,

08:59.763 --> 09:01.482
so you'll have to be home-schooled.

09:01.963 --> 09:05.275
Well, I'm sure you'll be an even better
teacher than the quizmaster.

09:05.443 --> 09:07.322
I'm afraid I'm too busy
substituting to do it.

09:07.484 --> 09:08.805
It's your aunt Hilda.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.679
You know what we haven't played
in a long time? Goofy golf.

No!

I feel a little breeze.

09:24.329 --> 09:26.561
That's just the life going out of us.

09:27.370 --> 09:30.808
I guess I've kind of forgotten how
to turn myself into any of the elements.

Take your time, Aunt Hilda. It's okay,
you know, my test is only in two days!

09:34.692 --> 09:37.333
I just haven't turned myself
into wind in years.

Would cabbage help?

09:40.094 --> 09:42.485
I guess the last time
was when I was on vacation

09:42.654 --> 09:44.692
in the Caribbean
with my boyfriend, Danny.

09:44.855 --> 09:47.529
We got into a fight
and he stormed out to take a walk.

to enjoy his walk, so I...

with one of his rescue workers.

This is ridiculous. I can't figure out
this stupid redox reaction, can you?

No, but that could be
because this is the class before lunch.

we're not the only ones.

10:44.630 --> 10:47.146
Gives an electron to the hydrogen

10:47.312 --> 10:51.306
in the nitric acid causing the copper
to become a solution.

You know, I'll deny this under oath,
but I missed you.

20:52.512 --> 20:53.946
- I knew it.
- Heh.

20:54.512 --> 20:55.832
I missed you too.

20:57.033 --> 20:58.592
Great. Well...

20:58.753 --> 21:00.950
All right, see you later, okay?

21:01.114 --> 21:02.309
- Albert?
- Yeah.

21:02.474 --> 21:05.274
Let's just stick
with Quizmaster, okay?

21:08.235 --> 21:11.435
And, down there, that's where
I went to elementary school.

21:11.597 --> 21:16.070
Wow, almost as exciting
as where you bought your toothpaste.

21:16.238 --> 21:19.232
Wait, you're the one who thought
it'd be fun to take a hot-air balloon ride.

21:19.399 --> 21:23.439
It was more fun in my imagination.
I don't know why.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.515
I'm having a great time.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.718
Whoever brought the Brie,

21:28.161 --> 21:29.675
thank you.

21:30.162 --> 21:33.439
Let's get out of here.
I've had my fill of talking vermin.

21:34.282 --> 21:36.594
She so wants me.
