WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:04.133
- LAST TIME,
ON "EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND"...

00:04.133 --> 00:05.733
- NO, KNOCK-KNOCK JOKES
RIGHT NOW.

00:05.733 --> 00:06.967
WE'RE GOING UPSTAIRS.

00:06.967 --> 00:08.933
- GEOFFREY, SAY, "ORANGE."

00:08.933 --> 00:10.367
- MARIE, PLEASE STOP.

00:10.367 --> 00:12.567
WE ARE NOT TELLING
KNOCK-KNOCK JOKES RIGHT NOW.

00:12.567 --> 00:15.167
WE ARE GOING UPSTAIRS
FOR OUR BATHS, ALL RIGHT?

00:15.167 --> 00:16.200
THANK YOU.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.200
LET'S GO.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.467
LET'S GO.

00:22.467 --> 00:24.400
- WELL.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.967
- YOUR MOTHER IS ACTING
LIKE A CHILD,

00:25.967 --> 00:27.400
GIVING ME THE SILENT TREATMENT.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.467
DO YOU REALIZE HOW
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE THAT IS?

00:29.467 --> 00:32.233
- FIRST OF ALL, I'M SORRY
I CAME OVER WHEN I DID.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.400
I SHOULD KNOW BY NOW,
BY LATE AFTERNOON,

00:34.400 --> 00:37.733
YOU'VE LOST COMPLETE CONTROL
OF THE KIDS.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.567
- SO...

00:43.567 --> 00:45.600
SHE'S TALKING TO YOU AGAIN.

00:47.667 --> 00:50.333
- WELL, SHE CAN DO WHATEVER
SHE WANTS,

00:50.333 --> 00:53.000
BECAUSE I'M DONE TALKING TO HER.

00:55.467 --> 00:57.833
- NOW, I KNOW
WHEN WE'RE ANGRY AND HURT,

00:57.833 --> 01:01.233
WE CAN ONLY SEE THE NEGATIVE
IN THE OTHER PERSON.

01:01.233 --> 01:04.467
BUT YOU TWO PEOPLE KNOW,
DEEP DOWN,

01:04.467 --> 01:06.400
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER,

01:06.400 --> 01:11.200
HOW YOU CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER,
AND HOW MUCH--

01:11.200 --> 01:14.233
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE EACH OTHER.

01:24.467 --> 01:26.633
- A GOOD FASTBALL
WITH SOME MOVEMENT ON IT.

01:26.633 --> 01:28.500
DOWN GOES JOHNSON.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.400
- FRANK, IF YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE CEREAL,

01:30.400 --> 01:32.267
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE THE MILK
SITTING OUT.

01:32.267 --> 01:34.433
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU THAT?

01:34.433 --> 01:35.300
- 1,000.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.633
MIGHT AS WELL JUST GIVE IT UP.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.900
- LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.467
IT'S A PIGSTY.

01:43.467 --> 01:45.867
YOU'RE LIKE SOME KIND
OF AN ANIMAL.

01:45.867 --> 01:47.700
- A PIG?

01:48.900 --> 01:52.233
- JUST WATCH YOURSELF, MISTER.

01:55.467 --> 01:57.467
- I TELL YA,
THIS THING WITH DEBRA

01:57.467 --> 01:58.967
HAS GOT HER NUTTIER
THAN EVER.

01:58.967 --> 02:00.567
THEY SHOULD JUST
LACE UP THE GLOVES

02:00.567 --> 02:04.267
AND GO AT IT
IN THE BACKYARD.

02:04.267 --> 02:06.600
- COME ON; THOSE TWO ARE
GOIN' THROUGH A TOUGH TIME.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.767
ALL YOU CAN THINK ABOUT
IS HOW IT AFFECTS YOU?

02:09.767 --> 02:13.333
- YOU'RE LIKE A LADY.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.167
- YOU KNOW WHAT I NOTICED?

02:20.167 --> 02:21.500
EVEN WHEN DEBRA'S ALL,

02:21.500 --> 02:23.367
"RAY! RAY! RAY! RAY! RAY!
RAY! RAY!"

02:23.367 --> 02:24.733
IF SHE FINDS OUT
I'M COMIN' OVER HERE,

02:24.733 --> 02:26.867
SHE GOES OUT OF HER WAY
TO BE NICE TO ME.

02:26.867 --> 02:27.933
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:27.933 --> 02:29.433
- WELL, LIKE YESTERDAY,

02:29.433 --> 02:31.000
MA WANTED ME TO COME OVER,

02:31.000 --> 02:32.600
AND DEBRA ALL OF A SUDDEN
WAS LIKE,

02:32.600 --> 02:35.300
"HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO
HIT A BUCKET OF BALLS?"

02:35.300 --> 02:38.433
- SHE TOLD YOU TO GO
TO THE DRIVING RANGE?

02:38.433 --> 02:39.600
- YEAH.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.367
AND THEN I ALSO WENT
ON THE GO-CARTS.

02:44.267 --> 02:46.400
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:46.400 --> 02:49.600
YOU SHOULD TRY THIS WITH MOM,
GET WHAT YOU WANT.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.400
JUST TALK TO HER,

02:51.400 --> 02:54.533
AND THROW DEBRA INTO THE MIX.

02:54.533 --> 02:56.733
- AH.

02:56.733 --> 02:58.900
I LIKE THAT...

02:58.900 --> 03:02.767
EXCEPT FOR
THE "TALK TO HER" PART.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.200
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO MA.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.767
SHE'S YOUR WIFE.

03:05.767 --> 03:08.767
- GO HOME.

03:08.767 --> 03:10.867
HEY, MARIE!

03:10.867 --> 03:12.100
- WHAT?

03:12.100 --> 03:14.400
- UH, YOU'RE RIGHT,

03:14.400 --> 03:16.400
I HAVE BEEN
MAKING A MESS HERE.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.700
WE'LL JUST GO OVER TO DEBRA'S.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.000
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.300
- YEAH, YEAH.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.000
I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.700
- NO, DON'T BE SILLY.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.167
SIT.

03:30.167 --> 03:31.500
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.233
IT'S EASY ENOUGH
TO GO ACROSS THE STREET.

03:33.233 --> 03:34.467
COME ON, RAY.

03:34.467 --> 03:36.967
- NO, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

03:36.967 --> 03:38.933
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?

03:38.933 --> 03:41.167
GRILLED CHEESE.

03:49.233 --> 03:50.867
- DOUBLE CHEESE?

03:50.867 --> 03:52.900
NO CRUST?

03:52.900 --> 03:55.367
- OF COURSE. SIT.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.633
WOULD YOU LIKE
A GRILLED CHEESE, RAYMOND?

04:00.633 --> 04:02.967
- YOU GOT BACON?

04:02.967 --> 04:04.333
- OF COURSE.

04:08.167 --> 04:09.633
- HOW ABOUT YOU, ROB?

04:09.633 --> 04:13.267
- [pointedly]
NO, THANK YOU.

04:14.667 --> 04:17.267
- OKAY, THEN,
TWO GRILLED CHEESE COMIN' UP.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.733
- I LOVE YOU.

04:32.567 --> 04:33.967
[phone rings]

04:33.967 --> 04:35.400
- HELLO.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.767
HEY, MA.

04:37.767 --> 04:39.467
YEAH, YEAH, DAD'S HERE.

04:39.467 --> 04:41.767
WE'RE JUST WATCHING THE GAME.

04:41.767 --> 04:44.667
YEAH, BUT SHE'S LEAVING
TO PICK UP THE KIDS.

04:44.667 --> 04:46.267
- DOES SHE WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING?

04:46.267 --> 04:49.300
TELL HER I'M HERE TOO.

04:49.300 --> 04:50.800
- ROBERT'S HERE TOO.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.000
I DON'T KNOW.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.067
HE WANTED ME TO TELL YOU.

04:55.867 --> 04:56.933
YEAH.

04:56.933 --> 04:57.933
ALL RIGHT.

04:57.933 --> 05:00.533
OKAY, BYE-BYE.

05:00.533 --> 05:03.033
MA WASN'T TOO HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE HERE, DAD.

05:03.033 --> 05:05.533
- GOOD, SHE'S GETTING
THE MESSAGE.

05:05.533 --> 05:06.667
I CAME OVER HERE

05:06.667 --> 05:08.633
BECAUSE THE OMELET
SHE MADE ME THIS MORNING

05:08.633 --> 05:12.067
WAS HALF-ASSED.

05:13.333 --> 05:14.733
- YOU'RE HERE TO PUNISH MA?

05:14.733 --> 05:16.100
I THINK THAT'S TERRIBLE.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.733
- NO, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S TERRIBLE:

05:17.733 --> 05:22.333
A SALAMI OMELET
THAT'S SKIMPY ON THE SALAMI.

05:22.333 --> 05:23.667
- YOU KNOW WHAT, RAY?

05:23.667 --> 05:25.400
TELL YOUR MOTHER
NOT TO CALL HERE ANYMORE.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.500
I AM SICK OF FEELING LIKE
I CAN'T ANSWER THE PHONE

05:27.500 --> 05:28.533
IN MY OWN HOUSE.

05:28.533 --> 05:30.100
- I CAN'T TELL HER
NOT TO CALL.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.567
- I'LL DO IT.

05:32.567 --> 05:34.533
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL HER
IF SHE NEEDS TO TALK TO ME

05:34.533 --> 05:37.100
TO LET THE PHONE RING ONCE--
THAT'LL BE HER SIGNAL--

05:37.100 --> 05:38.467
THEN HANG UP AND CALL BACK.

05:38.467 --> 05:40.000
- FINE, I'LL USE
THE SAME SIGNAL

05:40.000 --> 05:41.833
IF YOU'RE OVER THERE
AND I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

05:41.833 --> 05:44.100
- AND WHEN I PICK UP, YOU DO
A LITTLE HEAVY BREATHING--

05:44.100 --> 05:46.267
- I'LL BE BACK
IN HALF AN HOUR.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.567
- HELLO?

05:54.333 --> 05:56.300
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON, MA?

05:56.300 --> 05:58.967
- I THOUGHT YOU BOYS
COULD USE A LITTLE SNACK.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.933
STUFFED MUSHROOMS.

06:00.933 --> 06:02.700
- LET'S HAVE IT.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.367
- I KNOW IT'S USUALLY
SLIM PICKINGS AROUND HERE.

06:09.367 --> 06:11.000
THAT'S WHY I WANTED
TO BRING THESE OVER

06:11.000 --> 06:12.867
AS QUICKLY AS I COULD.

06:12.867 --> 06:15.167
- MMM, THESE ARE GOOD.

06:15.167 --> 06:18.967
BETTER THAN THAT OMELET.

06:18.967 --> 06:20.633
- YES, I KNOW.

06:20.633 --> 06:21.900
I'M SORRY.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.733
I WAS ALMOST OUT OF SALAMI,

06:23.733 --> 06:25.567
AND I KNEW
THE OMELET WASN'T RIGHT.

06:25.567 --> 06:28.333
I SHOULD'VE JUST THROWN IT OUT
OR GIVEN IT TO ROBBIE.

06:37.233 --> 06:38.667
WELL, EAT UP, BOYS.

06:38.667 --> 06:40.800
THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM...

06:40.800 --> 06:43.567
ACROSS THE STREET.

06:43.567 --> 06:48.267
- RAY, YOUR CAR IS BLOCKING ME,
SO IF YOU--

06:48.267 --> 06:51.967
SO I'LL JUST
TAKE YOUR CAR.

06:51.967 --> 06:54.667
OKAY?
IF THAT'S OKAY.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.533
- YEAH, OKAY.

06:57.533 --> 06:59.167
- WELL, BOYS,
I HAVE TO GET BACK.

06:59.167 --> 07:01.167
I'VE GOT A LOT OF TREATS
TO MAKE,

07:01.167 --> 07:03.567
WHICH WILL BE DELICIOUS.

07:03.567 --> 07:05.600
- YOU KNOW, RAY,
AS LONG AS I'M TAKING YOUR CAR,

07:05.600 --> 07:08.633
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GAS IT UP FOR YOU?

07:08.633 --> 07:13.167
- OH, YEAH, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.700
- NO, NO, IT WOULD BE FUN.

07:14.700 --> 07:18.533
- FRANK, I'M GONNA MAKE
CANNELLONI TONIGHT.

07:18.533 --> 07:20.967
- SOUNDS OKAY.

07:20.967 --> 07:22.500
- OH, ACTUALLY, NO.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.767
INSTEAD OF CANNELLONI,
I'LL MAKE SOME LAMB.

07:26.767 --> 07:28.767
A WHOLE LAMB.

07:30.833 --> 07:32.000
- YEAH?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.133
WITH THAT MINT JELLY I LIKE?

07:34.133 --> 07:38.767
- OF COURSE, WHATEVER YOU WANT,
H-HONEY.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.667
- OH, COME ON.

08:02.067 --> 08:03.400
- SO, RAY, UH...

08:03.400 --> 08:05.033
WHAT IF I BRING HOME
A PIZZA FOR DINNER?

08:05.033 --> 08:06.567
- OH.

08:06.567 --> 08:09.633
- AND MAYBE A NICE BOTTLE
OF WINE?

08:09.633 --> 08:11.667
- OH!

08:15.133 --> 08:18.267
- MARIE, NO WINE.

08:26.367 --> 08:29.033
- FRANK, YOU RASCAL.

08:30.733 --> 08:33.433
- OKAY, WELL,
I'LL SEE YOU, SWEETIE.

08:33.433 --> 08:35.100
BYE, FRANK.
BYE, ROBERT.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.733
- BYE.
- BYE.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.867
- I LOVE YOU FELLAS!

08:38.867 --> 08:40.600
BYE-BYE!

08:42.467 --> 08:44.267
- OH, MAN!

08:44.267 --> 08:47.200
WE GOTTA GET THESE TWO HENS
TOGETHER MORE OFTEN.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.733
- I KNOW.

08:48.733 --> 08:52.100
I'LL BET I CAN GET A WEEK
OF GOLF AT MYRTLE BEACH.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.633
- I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GET MARIE

08:53.633 --> 08:55.967
UP ON THE ROOF
TO CLEAN THE GUTTERS.

08:55.967 --> 08:59.767
[laughter]

09:04.333 --> 09:06.800
- YOU TWO, PLAYING YOUR WIVES
AGAINST EACH OTHER--

09:06.800 --> 09:08.433
YOU'RE DESPICABLE!

09:08.433 --> 09:11.933
- CALM DOWN, DAINTY DUCK.

09:11.933 --> 09:13.233
- YEAH, WHAT?

09:13.233 --> 09:14.833
WE TRIED TO GET THEM
TO STOP FIGHTING.

09:14.833 --> 09:16.900
IF THEY WANNA KEEP IT UP,
WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO SUFFER?

09:16.900 --> 09:19.033
- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN NOT SUFFERING

09:19.033 --> 09:20.367
AND EXPLOITING
THE SITUATION.

09:20.367 --> 09:22.267
YOU SHOULD BE
SUPPORTING YOUR WIVES,

09:22.267 --> 09:23.633
BRINGING THEM TOGETHER.

09:23.633 --> 09:26.733
THIS IS NOT THE WAY
FOR A FAMILY TO BEHAVE.

09:30.433 --> 09:32.767
- YOU KNOW, WHILE MARIE'S
UP ON THE ROOF,

09:32.767 --> 09:35.433
I'LL HAVE HER INSTALL
A SATELLITE DISH.

09:45.867 --> 09:47.600
- HI, ROBERT.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.767
- HEY, DEB.

09:49.767 --> 09:51.133
- COME ON IN.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.733
- ALL RIGHT.

09:54.067 --> 09:55.733
RAYMOND AROUND?

09:55.733 --> 09:58.567
- NO, HE'S OUT
BUYING HIMSELF A NEW PUTTER.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.933
- ISN'T THAT NICE FOR HIM.

10:03.933 --> 10:05.600
SO HOW ARE YOU?

10:05.600 --> 10:06.833
- I'M FINE.

10:06.833 --> 10:10.100
- THAT'S GOOD. I'M GLAD
ONE OF US IS FINE.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.667
- YOU'RE NOT FINE, ROBERT?

10:11.667 --> 10:13.467
- WELL, YOU KNOW ME--

10:13.467 --> 10:16.300
I DON'T DO WELL
WITH THE TENSION.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.033
IT GETS ME RIGHT IN THE GUT.

10:18.033 --> 10:19.667
AND THIS THING
WITH YOU AND MY MOM,

10:19.667 --> 10:23.167
MUY TENSIONOSO.

10:23.167 --> 10:25.733
- IS THAT SPANISH
FOR "VERY TENSE"?

10:25.733 --> 10:27.733
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.467
ALL I KNOW IS,
I'M POPPING ANTACIDS

10:32.467 --> 10:35.333
LIKE THEY'RE
COCKTAIL PEANUTS.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.067
COME ON, YOU KNOW,

10:37.067 --> 10:38.900
THIS FIGHT HAS GONE ON
LONG ENOUGH.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.467
I BET YOU CAN'T
EVEN REMEMBER

10:40.467 --> 10:42.800
WHY YOU WERE MAD AT EACH OTHER
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.200
- WHY?

10:44.200 --> 10:45.867
BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER
IS CONDESCENDING,

10:45.867 --> 10:47.367
OVERBEARING, PATRONIZING...

10:47.367 --> 10:48.767
- OKAY, OKAY.
- MANIPULATIVE--

10:48.767 --> 10:49.967
- OKAY!

10:49.967 --> 10:51.800
THE WHYS ARE NOT IMPORTANT.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.133
BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT

10:54.133 --> 10:57.567
IS TO REMEMBER
THAT LIFE IS SHORT.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.033
YOU KNOW HOW
THEY ALWAYS SAY

10:59.033 --> 11:01.900
YOU SHOULD NEVER
GO TO BED MAD?

11:01.900 --> 11:07.367
WELL, I SAY IT'D EVEN BE WORSE
TO GO TO THE BIG BED MAD.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.000
HMM?

11:10.333 --> 11:12.200
- I'M SORRY, ROBERT.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.900
I--I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

11:14.900 --> 11:16.700
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

11:16.700 --> 11:21.667
I NEED TO START THINKING
ABOUT MYSELF FOR A CHANGE.

11:23.033 --> 11:25.567
- OKAY.

11:28.467 --> 11:31.667
I KNOW THAT RAYMOND'S
THINKING ABOUT HIMSELF.

11:31.667 --> 11:34.467
- RAY? WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:34.467 --> 11:36.667
- HUH?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.833
- WHAT IS IT, ROBERT?

11:41.833 --> 11:44.433
- WELL, MAYBE IT'S JUST ME,

11:44.433 --> 11:45.967
BUT I'M OF THE OPINION
THAT A MAN SHOULD BE

11:45.967 --> 11:48.333
MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT HIS FAMILY'S WELL-BEING

11:48.333 --> 11:51.067
THAN FIGURING OUT A WAY
TO GET HIS WIFE TO LET HIM GO

11:51.067 --> 11:55.033
ON A WEEK-LONG GOLF RETREAT
TO MYRTLE BEACH.

11:55.033 --> 11:57.133
- WHAT GOLF RETREAT?

11:57.133 --> 11:58.433
- COME ON;
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED

11:58.433 --> 12:00.033
HE'S BEEN DROPPING HINTS
LIKE CRAZY?

12:00.033 --> 12:02.367
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE TOO BUSY RUNNING AROUND

12:02.367 --> 12:03.567
GASSING UP HIS CAR,

12:03.567 --> 12:12.067
DRINKING WINE,
AND HAVING TO...

12:12.067 --> 12:15.233
DO THINGS
BECAUSE OF THE WINE.

12:15.233 --> 12:17.100
- ROBERT, ALL I--

12:17.100 --> 12:18.767
- WAKE UP, SIS!

12:18.767 --> 12:21.167
DAD AND RAYMOND HAVE
A LAUNDRY LIST OF STUFF

12:21.167 --> 12:22.500
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET
OUT OF YOU TWO!

12:22.500 --> 12:24.433
THEY'RE EXPLOITING
THE SITUATION.

12:24.433 --> 12:26.267
THEY'RE PLAYING YOU TWO
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

12:26.267 --> 12:30.233
THEY'RE LAUGHING AT YOU,
AND IT'S MAKING ME SICK!

12:32.533 --> 12:37.067
BUT IF IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU...

12:45.500 --> 12:49.467
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY YOU SHOULD
NEVER GO TO BED MAD.

12:49.467 --> 12:53.767
WELL, I SAY IT'D BE EVEN WORSE
TO GO THE BIG BED MAD.

12:53.767 --> 12:56.133
HMM?

12:59.600 --> 13:01.600
ALL RIGHT, MA.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.667
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.667
AND I'M ONLY SAYING THIS
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT

13:05.667 --> 13:08.600
TO SEE YOU ON THE ROOF.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.233
- [whistling]

13:17.233 --> 13:20.633
HEY, MOONSHINE!

13:20.633 --> 13:23.567
WELL, HERE SHE IS.

13:23.567 --> 13:25.400
A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE
THAN I THOUGHT,

13:25.400 --> 13:27.467
BUT IT'LL BE WORTH IT,
YOU KNOW,

13:27.467 --> 13:31.967
IF I EVER GO ON A, I DON'T KNOW,
GOLF RETREAT OR SOMETHING.

13:31.967 --> 13:33.933
- YEAH, THAT'S NICE.

13:33.933 --> 13:36.167
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, RAY.

13:36.167 --> 13:38.067
HOW LONG DID YOU THINK
YOU'D BE ABLE

13:38.067 --> 13:40.133
TO USE ME AND YOUR MOM?

13:40.133 --> 13:42.067
- HOW'S THAT?

13:43.300 --> 13:45.033
- YOU DIDN'T THINK
I WAS SMART ENOUGH

13:45.033 --> 13:46.700
TO SEE WHAT YOU WERE DOING?

13:46.700 --> 13:48.833
- I DON'T--WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:48.833 --> 13:50.133
- DON'T PLAY DUMB WITH ME!

13:50.133 --> 13:52.333
- I'M NOT!
THIS IS HOW I AM.

13:54.533 --> 13:56.500
- YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY SUBTLE,

13:56.500 --> 13:58.667
SITTIN' THERE
LIKE SOME ROMAN EMPEROR.

13:58.667 --> 14:01.200
"BRING ME MY PIZZA!
SERVE ME MY WINE!

14:01.200 --> 14:03.200
PRETEND YOU'RE
A LONELY NURSE!"

14:12.667 --> 14:14.467
- HEY.

14:14.467 --> 14:16.300
YOU KNOW WHAT THE GUYS
AT THE LODGE

14:16.300 --> 14:17.767
WERE JUST TELLIN' ME?

14:17.767 --> 14:21.267
APPARENTLY, IF YOU
INSTALL IT YOURSELF,

14:21.267 --> 14:25.567
A SATELLITE DISH IS
ACTUALLY QUITE AFFORDABLE.

14:25.567 --> 14:28.300
MAKES YOU THINK,
DOESN'T IT?

14:28.300 --> 14:31.167
ANYWAY, MAKE ME A SANDWICH,
WILL YA?

14:32.300 --> 14:33.633
- YOU WANT A SANDWICH?

14:33.633 --> 14:36.533
- UH, ROAST BEEF, MAYO,
MUSTARD, LETTUCE,

14:36.533 --> 14:40.100
TOMATO, CHEESE,
EASY ONION.

14:40.100 --> 14:43.600
- SOUNDS NICE.
WHAT KIND OF BREAD?

14:43.600 --> 14:47.900
- LET'S GO WITH THE WHOLE WHEAT
TODAY, SHALL WE?

14:47.900 --> 14:49.433
- ALL RIGHT.

14:51.067 --> 14:54.767
- OW! HEY! HEY! OW!

14:54.767 --> 14:56.533
OKAY, WHITE BREAD, THEN!

14:56.533 --> 14:59.000
- YOU DIDN'T THINK I'D
CATCH ON TO YOU, MR. SLEAZY MAN?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.800
OH, I CAUGHT ON.
OH, DID I CATCH ON!

15:01.800 --> 15:04.500
SURE, GETTING THE TWO OF US
TO WAIT ON YOU HAND AND FOOT,

15:04.500 --> 15:06.600
THROUGH EXPLOITING
THE SITUATION.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.300
I WISH THIS BREAD
WAS STALE.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.733
I WOULD GIVE YOU
A CONCUSSION!

15:25.767 --> 15:27.367
LOOK WHO IT IS.

15:27.367 --> 15:30.000
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE HERE
TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.233
- DON'T ASK
FOR A SANDWICH.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.000
- IF YOU'RE HUNGRY, I SUGGEST
YOU GO BACK ACROSS THE STREET,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.400
'CAUSE THIS KITCHEN
IS CLOSED!

15:40.167 --> 15:42.533
- HER TOO?

15:42.533 --> 15:44.167
- YEAH.

15:44.167 --> 15:45.667
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

15:45.667 --> 15:47.167
- DEBRA.

15:47.167 --> 15:48.667
SHE STARTED YELLIN' AT ME

15:48.667 --> 15:50.700
AND TELLIN' ME I WAS USING
HER FIGHT WITH MOM

15:50.700 --> 15:52.000
FOR MY OWN GOOD,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.467
SAID I WAS EXPLOITING
THE SITUATION.

15:54.467 --> 15:56.800
- WAIT A MINUTE.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.467
"EXPLOITING THE SITUATION,"

15:58.467 --> 16:00.467
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
YOUR MOTHER JUST SAID.

16:00.467 --> 16:03.467
- REALLY? WELL, HOW DID
BOTH MOM AND DEBRA KNOW--

16:03.467 --> 16:06.000
- OH, HEY,
I FORGOT MY TUMS.

16:20.933 --> 16:23.000
WELL, I'M OFF.

16:25.867 --> 16:27.400
- HEY, ROBERT.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.200
YOU GOT ANY IDEA
WHY RAY AND I

16:30.200 --> 16:33.300
JUST GOT OUR GRAPES CRUSHED
BY THE BROADS?

16:37.667 --> 16:39.467
- OKAY, TAKE IT EASY.

16:39.467 --> 16:42.167
SOME THINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID
IN PASSING THAT--

16:42.167 --> 16:44.667
THAT POSSIBLY COULD HAVE BEEN
MISCONSTRUED.

16:44.667 --> 16:47.400
- YOU SOLD US OUT, MAN!
- YOU'RE A RAT!

16:47.400 --> 16:49.400
WE HAD SOMETHING GOOD GOING,
AND YOU RUINED IT!

16:49.400 --> 16:50.733
- OKAY, HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

16:50.733 --> 16:52.800
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
"SOMETHING GOOD" GOING.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.333
- YES, WE DID!

16:54.333 --> 16:57.000
FOR ONCE,
I WAS ENJOYING MY MARRIAGE!

16:59.533 --> 17:02.067
- LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

17:02.067 --> 17:03.533
YOU TWO GOT
WHAT YOU DESERVED.

17:03.533 --> 17:05.200
I DON'T CARE
THAT YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.333
I'M SORRY THAT YOUR PUTTER
GOT BENT, RAYMOND,

17:07.333 --> 17:09.333
AND I'M SORRY
MA'S NOT HANGING OFF THE ROOF

17:09.333 --> 17:12.133
WITH 50 FOOT OF CABLE
AND A RATCHET!

17:17.467 --> 17:21.800
BUT, BY GOD,
I WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

17:21.800 --> 17:26.267
TO MAKE THIS FAMILY WHOLE!

17:26.267 --> 17:28.900
- I THINK YOU'RE
THE FAMILY HOLE.

17:28.900 --> 17:30.800
- OH, YEAH?
- YEAH.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.967
[both yelling]

17:33.967 --> 17:35.833
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

17:35.833 --> 17:38.233
- HEY, ROBERT, WHY DON'T YOU
RUN CRYIN' TO YOUR MOMMY

17:38.233 --> 17:40.533
AND TELL HER ABOUT HOW MEAN
WE JUST WERE TO YOU?

17:40.533 --> 17:43.100
- YEAH, SQUEAL ON US AGAIN,
MOMMY-LOVER!

17:44.700 --> 17:46.233
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.600
- SHUT UP, RAYMOND.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.400
[men gasp]

17:49.400 --> 17:54.267
- WE DON'T SAY "SHUT UP"
IN THIS HOUSE.

17:54.267 --> 17:56.200
- FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S NEVER SQUEALING

17:56.200 --> 17:58.500
IF YOU'RE TELLING SOMETHING
TO YOUR MOTHER.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.800
AND I HAPPEN TO APPRECIATE
ROBBIE LETTING ME KNOW

18:00.800 --> 18:04.633
WHAT YOU TWO WERE TRYING
TO DO TO DEBRA AND ME.

18:04.633 --> 18:08.800
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.767
[phone rings]

18:10.767 --> 18:12.233
- WAIT.

18:16.133 --> 18:18.167
ONE RING.

18:18.167 --> 18:20.633
THAT'S DEBRA'S SIGNAL.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.000
[ringing resumes]

18:22.000 --> 18:24.733
- YOU CAN PICK UP
THAT PHONE, MA.

18:24.733 --> 18:26.133
[ringing]

18:26.133 --> 18:28.733
MA, MAKE THIS RIGHT.

18:28.733 --> 18:32.667
YOU CAN MAKE THIS RIGHT.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.200
[ringing continues]

18:34.200 --> 18:37.233
YOU CAN DO IT, MA.

18:37.233 --> 18:39.567
REMEMBER THAT BIG BED.

18:42.167 --> 18:44.000
ATTAWAY, MA!

18:44.000 --> 18:45.667
MA!

18:47.233 --> 18:49.267
THIS WAS YOUR CHANCE!

18:49.267 --> 18:51.100
WHAT DID WE JUST
TALK ABOUT IN THERE?

18:51.100 --> 18:52.533
WHAT ABOUT THE BIG BED?

18:52.533 --> 18:54.133
- ALL YOUR TALK
ABOUT THE BIG BED,

18:54.133 --> 18:55.567
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL THAT TO DEBRA?

18:55.567 --> 18:58.500
- I DID!

18:58.500 --> 19:01.733
- YOU DID?

19:03.567 --> 19:07.567
YOU TOLD HER
THE SAME THING YOU TOLD ME?

19:07.567 --> 19:09.700
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO--
TO SHOW--

19:09.700 --> 19:12.933
- OH! ENOUGH.

19:12.933 --> 19:16.233
YOU'RE A DOUBLE AGENT.

19:16.233 --> 19:18.433
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:18.433 --> 19:21.733
- YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT A DOUBLE AGENT WOULD SAY.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.300
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH FAITH IN ME

19:28.300 --> 19:29.933
TO KNOW THAT I WOULD DO
THE RIGHT THING,

19:29.933 --> 19:31.300
SO YOU WENT TO HER TOO.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.500
- YOU DIDN'T DO
THE RIGHT THING!

19:32.500 --> 19:34.033
- THAT'S HARDLY THE POINT!

19:34.033 --> 19:35.867
- HARDLY!

19:35.867 --> 19:38.100
WHAT HE DID IS MUCH WORSE
THAN WHAT WE DID, RIGHT, MA?

19:38.100 --> 19:40.300
- SHUT UP, RAYMOND.

19:41.833 --> 19:45.500
- WE SAY IT ALL THE TIME NOW?

19:45.500 --> 19:47.300
- TELL ME SOMETHING,
ROBERT.

19:47.300 --> 19:51.033
WHO DID YOU TALK TO FIRST
ABOUT THIS, DEBRA OR ME?

19:51.033 --> 19:53.167
- I DON'T REMEMBER.

19:53.167 --> 19:54.800
- YOU WENT TO HER FIRST,

19:54.800 --> 19:57.233
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T WAIT
TO TAKE HER SIDE OVER MINE!

19:57.233 --> 19:58.800
- I'M ON NO ONE'S SIDE!

19:58.800 --> 20:01.233
- YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T LOVE ME
THE WAY I LOVE YOU.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.300
GET OUT!
- MA!

20:03.300 --> 20:04.933
I'M ON THE FAMILY'S SIDE!

20:04.933 --> 20:06.900
- THROW HIM OUT!
- WITH PLEASURE!

20:06.900 --> 20:09.700
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING!

20:09.700 --> 20:11.800
BUT LET ME JUST SAY THIS.

20:11.800 --> 20:16.900
WHEN WE ARE ALL
IN THAT BIG BED,

20:16.900 --> 20:20.700
I'LL BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE
TO SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT.

20:28.267 --> 20:30.167
- I AIN'T SLEEPIN'
IN THAT BED WITH HIM.

20:30.167 --> 20:31.733
HE SLEEPS NAKED.

20:49.167 --> 20:51.300
- I WASN'T GOIN' ANYWHERE.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.400
DON'T BEND 'EM.

21:13.867 --> 21:15.200
- [sighs]

21:26.433 --> 21:28.433
I'D LIKE SOME CHIPS.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.700
- OH!
