WEBVTT

00:00.171 --> 00:03.010
Previously
on "Desperate Housewives"...

00:03.034 --> 00:05.152
You're not taking me?
Dad's gonna take you.

00:05.176 --> 00:06.083
Lynette's new job
came with a price.

00:06.107 --> 00:07.354
If this charge sticks,

00:07.378 --> 00:09.416
I get sent away for eight years.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.618
And Carlos paid
for his mistakes.

00:11.642 --> 00:13.160
Are you in love
with Mr. Williams?

00:13.184 --> 00:14.361
No.

00:14.385 --> 00:16.123
I think the machine
picked up on something

00:16.146 --> 00:17.124
that I wasn't aware of.

00:17.148 --> 00:18.225
While Bree detected feelings

00:18.249 --> 00:19.596
she'd never known.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.528
You come within 10 feet of her,
I will have you arrested.

00:21.552 --> 00:23.700
Now get out.
Susan discovered something...

00:23.724 --> 00:25.602
Zach is your son, isn't he?

00:25.626 --> 00:28.196
Too close to home.

00:30.061 --> 00:32.008
The residents
of the Fairview county jail

00:32.031 --> 00:34.186
looked forward to every Tuesday.

00:34.210 --> 00:36.683
That was the day
that Gabrielle solis

00:36.707 --> 00:38.285
came to visit her husband.

00:38.309 --> 00:42.018
The inmates went out of their
way to give her compliments

00:42.042 --> 00:45.021
whether she wanted them to
or not.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.024
With each visit,
these accolades became

00:48.048 --> 00:51.228
increasingly inventive.

00:51.252 --> 00:54.161
Still, Gabrielle
was not flattered.

00:54.185 --> 00:57.164
In fact,
Gabrielle started to dread

00:57.188 --> 00:59.688
this special attention.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.311
Until one day, when...

01:04.334 --> 01:06.673
I don't think a conjugal visit
is such a ridiculous request.

01:06.697 --> 01:08.675
With all due respect,
Mrs. Solis,

01:08.699 --> 01:10.717
let's just get through
the discovery phase first, okay?

01:10.741 --> 01:12.719
But I don't think
I can wait that long.

01:12.743 --> 01:14.726
I am trying to get your husband
out of jail.

01:14.750 --> 01:16.723
Do you want me to just
stop everything

01:16.747 --> 01:18.725
so you can have a Booty call?

01:18.749 --> 01:20.727
Excuse me,
we are husband and wife.

01:20.751 --> 01:23.290
We make love.
It is a very sacred covenant.

01:23.314 --> 01:25.297
Okay, look,
all we need is 20 minutes.

01:25.321 --> 01:27.394
I said no. You can't tell me no.

01:27.418 --> 01:30.097
You work forme.
You will make it happen.

01:30.121 --> 01:32.068
You can't force me
to do anything.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.342
I am not your maid
or your gardener.

01:35.366 --> 01:37.204
Whoa! Oh!

01:37.228 --> 01:38.745
I can have you
arrested for that.

01:38.769 --> 01:40.847
Oh, really?
And how about for this?

01:40.871 --> 01:42.149
Ow!

01:42.173 --> 01:43.450
You crazy bitch!

01:43.474 --> 01:44.551
Ow!

01:44.575 --> 01:46.635
Hey, apologize to the lady.

01:48.239 --> 01:50.287
Big mistake, pal.
I play golf with the warden.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.289
You're gonna rot...

01:52.313 --> 01:53.790
Aah!

01:53.814 --> 01:56.193
You heard him. Apologize.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.464
Look, fellas,

01:57.488 --> 01:59.366
I am just trying to do my job.
This is all her fault!

01:59.390 --> 02:00.567
Oh!

02:00.591 --> 02:02.229
If she weren't so damn horny...
Ow!

02:02.253 --> 02:03.570
All right! All right!

02:05.726 --> 02:06.726
Come on!

02:09.400 --> 02:12.279
It was at that moment
it occurred to Gabrielle...

02:12.303 --> 02:14.281
Apologize!

02:14.305 --> 02:18.885
This was the nicest compliment
she had ever received.

02:18.909 --> 02:26.909
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

03:02.913 --> 03:04.891
There was one thing

03:04.915 --> 03:08.164
all the fathers on
Wisteria Lane had in common...

03:08.188 --> 03:10.837
They could return home
from a hard day's work

03:10.861 --> 03:13.240
to the family they'd left behind

03:13.264 --> 03:15.851
and not feel at all guilty
about the precious moments

03:15.875 --> 03:17.496
they had missed.

03:20.200 --> 03:25.210
Sadly, the same could not be
said for the working mothers.

03:44.455 --> 03:46.433
Hey, honey, I held dinner
for as long as I could.

03:46.457 --> 03:47.934
It just got...

03:47.958 --> 03:49.576
Too late for them.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.578
You couldn't have given 'em
coffee or something?

03:51.602 --> 03:55.249
I just feel like I'm missing out
on their lives entirely.

03:55.273 --> 03:56.543
Hey, you sit, eat,

03:56.567 --> 03:58.885
and I will fill you in.

03:58.909 --> 04:02.349
Oh, don't eat that. That's been
sitting out for hours.

04:02.373 --> 04:03.520
That's for Mrs. Mulberry.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.951
This...

04:04.975 --> 04:07.454
Is for you.

04:07.478 --> 04:09.296
I'm sorry. Who?

04:09.320 --> 04:10.797
Oh, Mrs. Mulberry.

04:10.821 --> 04:12.799
Parker has an imaginary friend.

04:12.823 --> 04:14.831
Um, British nanny.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.934
I think he really locked into
the whole "Mary poppins" thing.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.437
Is that why he's sleeping
with an umbrella?

04:20.461 --> 04:22.369
He carries it with him
everywhere.

04:22.393 --> 04:24.271
It's a security blanket.

04:24.295 --> 04:25.772
When did this start?

04:25.796 --> 04:27.814
About a week ago, I guess.

04:27.838 --> 04:29.476
And you don't find it odd

04:29.500 --> 04:31.318
that Parker's new nanny
made her appearance

04:31.342 --> 04:33.380
right at the time
I went back to work?

04:33.404 --> 04:35.387
Kids have imaginary friends.
It's no big deal.

04:35.411 --> 04:37.384
I'll agree with you to a point,

04:37.408 --> 04:39.426
when they're flying kangaroos
or giant robots,

04:39.450 --> 04:41.027
not surrogate mommies.

04:41.051 --> 04:43.330
Hey...

04:43.354 --> 04:45.671
Parker is having
a little trouble adjusting.

04:45.695 --> 04:48.795
That's all.
Apparently, so are you.

04:48.819 --> 04:50.397
Honey, don't be so sensitive.

04:50.421 --> 04:52.899
I hope you're right.

04:52.923 --> 04:56.443
At the risk of sounding
too sensitive,

04:56.467 --> 04:58.467
how come she gets
a bigger portion?

05:06.737 --> 05:08.415
That's it?

05:08.439 --> 05:10.417
You're the one who said

05:10.441 --> 05:12.058
you wanted things
to be casual between us.

05:12.082 --> 05:14.060
Yeah, but that doesn't mean

05:14.084 --> 05:16.067
we have to act like
brother and sister.

05:16.091 --> 05:19.086
I mean, you bought me ribs.
I have gratitude to express.

05:23.854 --> 05:25.832
What's wrong?

05:25.856 --> 05:27.334
I can't do this.

05:27.358 --> 05:30.777
This casual thing...
It's... it's weird.

05:30.801 --> 05:33.480
No! No! It's not.

05:33.504 --> 05:35.617
We're just gonna pretend
like it was

05:35.641 --> 05:37.614
when we first started dating.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.616
We just see each other
occasionally,

05:39.640 --> 05:42.489
you know, until we get
the Zach thing resolved.

05:42.513 --> 05:45.460
Yeah, well, we'll just be easy
about it. No commitments.

05:45.484 --> 05:46.753
Except, of course,

05:46.777 --> 05:49.956
neither of us is allowed
to date anybody else.

05:49.980 --> 05:52.659
Look, I...

05:52.683 --> 05:54.670
I know how you feel about Zach.

05:54.694 --> 05:57.103
And, look, I don't blame you.

05:57.127 --> 05:59.866
But he's part of the package
right now,

05:59.890 --> 06:03.360
and either you can accept that
or you can't.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.870
Well, anyway...

06:17.708 --> 06:19.548
Mike, wait!

06:21.952 --> 06:23.590
I accept.

06:23.614 --> 06:25.892
Are you sure?

06:25.916 --> 06:27.394
Zach's your son.

06:27.418 --> 06:30.467
And I have Julie,
and you've totally accepted her.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.539
I mean, granted, she's been
the model child so far.

06:32.563 --> 06:35.747
But she's almost 15. She's going
to turn on me any minute.

06:35.771 --> 06:38.104
And you better be there
to help me when it gets ugly.

06:38.128 --> 06:40.398
I will.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.555
Good night.

06:48.579 --> 06:49.886
Uh, Susan? Yeah?

06:49.910 --> 06:55.792
Technically, we don't have
to be casual anymore.

06:55.816 --> 07:00.066
I can be naked in 20 seconds.
That includes travel time.

07:00.090 --> 07:01.668
Carlos, will you calm down?

07:01.692 --> 07:03.670
You incited a prison riot.

07:03.694 --> 07:05.677
It wasn't a riot.
It was more of a melee.

07:05.701 --> 07:07.403
Who's going to defend me now?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.406
Doyle knew my case. He knew
the judge. He called me a bitch.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.178
Well, were you acting like one?

07:12.202 --> 07:14.772
He refused to help me
get a conjugal visit.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.114
Hold it.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.647
My lawyer's in traction
because you wanted sex?

07:20.671 --> 07:23.490
Not just for me, for us.

07:23.514 --> 07:25.557
In case you haven't noticed,
Carlos,

07:25.581 --> 07:28.054
our marriage is still
on shaky ground.

07:28.078 --> 07:31.598
And you thought a conjugal
visit would fix it? It couldn't hurt.

07:31.622 --> 07:33.930
Ever since you've been in here,
all we do is bicker.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.108
That's all we ever did when
I was out. That's whatwedo!

07:37.132 --> 07:39.105
Yeah, but when
we would finish arguing,

07:39.129 --> 07:41.207
we would have this great sex.
Now all we do is fight,

07:41.231 --> 07:43.209
and there's no payoff,
and it sucks!

07:43.233 --> 07:44.873
You and I need to get laid!

07:46.637 --> 07:48.114
Oh, don't judge me.

07:48.138 --> 07:50.677
You're not in here because
you got caught helping the poor.

07:50.701 --> 07:53.620
See, we'd be enjoying
this argument more

07:53.644 --> 07:55.731
if we had something
to look forward to.

07:55.755 --> 07:58.846
Fine. Get the damn lawyer.

08:00.951 --> 08:03.911
And make it quick.

08:08.859 --> 08:11.498
I take it that was
my good night kiss.

08:11.522 --> 08:13.500
George,
you're a very special friend.

08:13.524 --> 08:15.507
You are, but Rex
hasn't been dead four weeks,

08:15.531 --> 08:17.504
so I think kissing
on the lips is...

08:17.528 --> 08:18.945
Further than you want to go.

08:18.969 --> 08:20.899
Exactly. I hope you don't mind.

08:25.676 --> 08:28.484
Andrew, what are you doing?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.817
Taking out the garbage.

08:30.841 --> 08:32.818
Of course.
You remember Mr. Williams.

08:32.842 --> 08:34.821
Hi, Andrew.

08:34.845 --> 08:36.515
George.

08:38.649 --> 08:40.697
Uh, well,
it's getting late, so...

08:40.721 --> 08:43.499
Yeah. So let me know if you want
to go out to dinner again soon.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.537
There's a couple new restaurants
I'd like to try.

08:45.561 --> 08:47.574
You know, we've been eating out
a lot lately.

08:47.598 --> 08:50.737
Why don't you come over Friday
for a home-cooked meal?

08:50.761 --> 08:52.701
Wouldn't that be nice?
Oh, I would love that.

08:56.106 --> 08:59.185
So you leaving or what?

08:59.209 --> 09:00.817
We're not done talking.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.549
She said it was getting late.

09:02.573 --> 09:04.556
In case you missed that,
that was a hint.

09:04.580 --> 09:06.052
Andrew...

09:06.076 --> 09:07.894
That wasn't a hint.

09:07.918 --> 09:10.618
I'll go when I'm ready.

09:13.724 --> 09:17.804
Actually, it is getting late,
and I am tired so...

09:17.828 --> 09:19.666
See? You heard the lady. Now...

09:19.690 --> 09:20.667
Take off.

09:20.691 --> 09:21.808
Andrew.

09:21.832 --> 09:23.810
It's okay.
He's not really that tough.

09:23.834 --> 09:26.943
He knows I would never
hit a child.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.315
Andrew!

09:29.339 --> 09:31.317
George!

09:31.341 --> 09:34.571
Stop it, the two of you,
this instant!

09:36.176 --> 09:38.154
This was
a perfectly lovely evening,

09:38.178 --> 09:40.687
and now the both of you
have ruined it.

09:40.711 --> 09:42.659
I will not tolerate
this kind of behavior.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.293
Do you understand?

09:48.218 --> 09:51.167
All right, then.

09:51.191 --> 09:55.271
George, we'll see you Friday
for dinner.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.225
I'll be serving fish.

10:11.281 --> 10:12.759
Hey, buddy.

10:12.783 --> 10:16.222
Hey, wake up, sleepyhead.
Parker.

10:16.246 --> 10:17.864
Hi. Hiya, pal.

10:17.888 --> 10:19.365
Hey, what do you say

10:19.389 --> 10:21.898
you and me go get
some doughnuts, okay,

10:21.922 --> 10:23.670
before mommy has to go to work?

10:23.694 --> 10:27.033
Yeah? Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

10:27.057 --> 10:30.076
All right. Oh.

10:30.100 --> 10:34.711
So what do you think
you're gonna have, huh? Jelly?

10:34.735 --> 10:37.984
'Cause I think
I'm gonna have a bear claw.

10:38.008 --> 10:40.787
Stop!

10:40.811 --> 10:42.318
I forgot Mrs. Mulberry.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.690
What?

10:43.714 --> 10:47.694
Oh, um, well, since I'mhere,

10:47.718 --> 10:52.759
maybe she could just relax
in the house for awhile, okay?

10:52.783 --> 10:54.400
No, I need her!

10:54.424 --> 10:56.694
Okay.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.830
Hello, Mrs. Mulberry.

11:03.794 --> 11:06.444
Don't forget to buckle up.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.245
Here we go.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.717
Wait!

11:10.741 --> 11:12.418
You forgot her umbrella.

11:12.442 --> 11:15.151
Well, Parker,
we don't have time.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.652
No!

11:16.676 --> 11:18.206
Sheneedsit.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.333
Hi.

11:27.357 --> 11:29.335
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

11:29.359 --> 11:30.837
I'm looking
for Parker's umbrella.

11:30.861 --> 11:33.669
Have you seen it?
No. Nope. Sorry.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.672
Hey, honey, you better hurry.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.126
You're gonna be late for
work. Thank you for that.

11:48.338 --> 11:50.817
I couldn't find
Mrs. Mulberry's umbrella,

11:50.841 --> 11:52.819
so I brought her
her sun hat instead,

11:52.843 --> 11:55.121
all right?

11:55.145 --> 11:56.823
And here we go.
It's in the shower.

11:56.847 --> 11:57.694
What?

11:57.718 --> 12:00.196
Mrs. Mulberry says
she left it in the shower.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.198
Well, why didn't mrs. Mulberry

12:02.222 --> 12:03.699
volunteer that information

12:03.723 --> 12:05.710
before I turned your room
upside down

12:05.734 --> 12:07.834
looking for it, hmm?

12:07.858 --> 12:09.275
Are you going to go get it?

12:09.299 --> 12:12.059
No, I'm not gonna get
the damn umbrella!

12:14.404 --> 12:18.214
I'm so sorry, sweetie.
I am not mad at you.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.408
What are you doing?

12:22.913 --> 12:25.083
Uh...

12:26.746 --> 12:30.376
We don't want doughnuts.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.237
Ahem.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.770
Andrew, you are not
leaving the house

12:43.794 --> 12:45.812
dressed like that.

12:45.836 --> 12:47.814
I'm just going to meet
some of the guys

12:47.838 --> 12:48.945
at the swim club.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.947
I don't care. Put this on.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.820
Every time you leave this house,

12:53.844 --> 12:55.127
you represent this family,

12:55.151 --> 12:58.084
and the least you can do
is not humiliate us.

12:58.108 --> 13:00.226
A ripped t-shirt is just a look.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.889
Yes, a bad one.

13:02.913 --> 13:05.997
I hope you haven't made plans
for tomorrow night.

13:06.021 --> 13:08.164
Look, if you think
I'm having dinner

13:08.188 --> 13:10.166
with the pharmacist,
you're crazy.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.168
Part of the reason
I'm having him over

13:12.192 --> 13:14.841
is so that you
can get to know him.

13:14.865 --> 13:17.844
Yeah, well, I don't want
to get to know him.

13:17.868 --> 13:19.846
Honey, the feelings
that you're having

13:19.870 --> 13:21.347
are perfectly normal.

13:21.371 --> 13:24.350
But George isn't trying
to take your father's place.

13:24.374 --> 13:26.291
He's... well, he's just a friend.

13:26.315 --> 13:27.783
Really? Just a friend?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.115
Mm-hmm.

13:29.139 --> 13:31.517
So you're not planning
on getting more serious

13:31.541 --> 13:33.019
with this guy in the future?

13:33.043 --> 13:35.892
You know, I haven't even
thought about it.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.046
You're so transparent,
it's pathetic.

13:39.389 --> 13:41.367
You're worried about
a ripped t-shirt

13:41.391 --> 13:42.869
humiliating this family?

13:42.893 --> 13:45.877
Wait till people see that
you're dating the town nerd

13:45.901 --> 13:48.835
less than a month after
your husband's funeral.

13:48.859 --> 13:51.437
I'll be serving dinner
tomorrow night at 7.

13:51.461 --> 13:54.915
Please don't be late. I'm sorry,
but I already have plans.

13:54.939 --> 13:57.083
Andrew, don't you have
a meet at the swim club?

13:57.107 --> 13:58.814
Yeah, so?

13:58.838 --> 14:02.919
Doesn't it require
a large entrance fee,

14:02.943 --> 14:06.353
one that you can't afford
by yourself?

14:08.248 --> 14:11.327
Are you blackmailing me
into coming to dinner?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.529
Oh, you don't know
the lengths I'd go to

14:13.553 --> 14:15.233
for even seating.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.608
Mayer, is this yours?

14:22.632 --> 14:24.110
Blew into my front yard.

14:24.134 --> 14:27.173
Oh, sorry.
I'm helping Mike find Zach.

14:27.197 --> 14:30.176
You know, so we can all
rest easy at night.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.178
Uh-huh. And put him in jail?

14:32.202 --> 14:33.880
I don't think Mike

14:33.904 --> 14:36.052
would do that to his own son.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.183
You know?

14:37.207 --> 14:40.107
That Mike's Zach's
real father? Yes.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.559
Oh. Julie told Karl,
Karl told me,

14:43.583 --> 14:47.934
and I, well, sent out
a few e-mails.

14:47.958 --> 14:50.997
Well, thanks
for your discretion.

14:51.021 --> 14:53.439
Boy, you would doanything

14:53.463 --> 14:55.871
to get Mike Delfino to love you.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.044
So what's gonna happen
to little creepy

14:58.068 --> 15:00.046
when he gets here?

15:00.070 --> 15:02.048
Are you gonna be
tucking him in at night?

15:02.072 --> 15:04.050
Making him breakfast
in the morning?

15:04.074 --> 15:06.517
Careful to Bob and weave as he
tries to blow your head off?

15:06.541 --> 15:08.354
You know, Edie,
could you just back off?

15:08.378 --> 15:09.885
I mean, the truth is,

15:09.909 --> 15:11.617
we're probably never
gonna find Zach anyway.

15:11.641 --> 15:13.619
It's a needle in a haystack.

15:13.643 --> 15:15.121
Oh, I see.

15:15.145 --> 15:18.024
And then you'll still come off
as little miss perfect,

15:18.048 --> 15:19.325
self-sacrificing girlfriend,

15:19.349 --> 15:21.597
putting his needs

15:21.621 --> 15:23.099
ahead of yours.

15:23.123 --> 15:27.563
Oh, why, you conniving
little shrew.

15:29.659 --> 15:33.129
I don't know why
we're not closer.

15:45.215 --> 15:47.353
There was a reason David Bradley

15:47.377 --> 15:52.198
was the most successful lawyer
in all of Fairview.

15:52.222 --> 15:54.630
His arguments were persuasive...

15:54.654 --> 15:57.133
No one ever has to know.

15:57.157 --> 16:00.106
His manner was forceful...

16:00.130 --> 16:02.538
Take it off. Take it off.

16:02.562 --> 16:05.641
And he tended to win on appeal.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.235
Please.

16:10.500 --> 16:15.281
And when it came
to the more challenging cases,

16:15.305 --> 16:17.223
he knew it was to his advantage

16:17.247 --> 16:20.086
to raise the first objection.

16:20.110 --> 16:21.657
I'm not gonna take your case.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.659
What?

16:23.683 --> 16:24.991
Yes.

16:25.015 --> 16:27.063
Sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Bradley.

16:27.087 --> 16:30.366
Your dinner just canceled.
Want me to pull the reservation?

16:30.390 --> 16:32.398
No, I still have to eat.
I'm sorry, where were we?

16:32.422 --> 16:35.101
You were about to turn me down,
and then you reconsidered

16:35.125 --> 16:37.403
once you realized I was gonna
throw a ton of money at you,

16:37.427 --> 16:39.045
which I am.

16:39.069 --> 16:42.048
Ah. It's not about the money
for me anymore, Mrs. Solis.

16:42.072 --> 16:44.250
The fact is, if I don't feel
passionately about a client,

16:44.274 --> 16:46.757
if I don't feel
that fire in my belly,

16:46.781 --> 16:48.754
I don't bring
my a-game to court,

16:48.778 --> 16:50.316
and from what I've read,

16:50.340 --> 16:52.318
it'll take my a-game
to save your husband.

16:52.342 --> 16:54.490
Is this about
the gay bashing thing?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.731
He's innocent. He went berserk
and attacked a man in court.

16:56.755 --> 16:58.724
Yeah, but that was
a jealousy thing.

16:58.748 --> 17:01.997
The man that my husband
was trying to kill in court

17:02.021 --> 17:04.099
is not the least bit gay,
trust me.

17:04.124 --> 17:07.078
Your file also says
you're seeking conjugal visits.

17:07.102 --> 17:09.234
Trying to keep
the old marriage alive, huh?

17:09.259 --> 17:11.237
Why does everybody
have a problem

17:11.261 --> 17:13.739
with me having sex
with my husband?

17:13.762 --> 17:16.242
Can I be frank?

17:16.266 --> 17:20.046
Only if it ends with me
getting what I want.

17:20.069 --> 17:21.416
Your marriage is doomed.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.520
Excuse me? I've been doing
this for a long time, Mrs. Solis.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.261
I know what incarceration
can do to a relationship.

17:27.285 --> 17:29.355
Marriage is hard enough,

17:29.379 --> 17:31.357
but when you throw in
cement walls,

17:31.381 --> 17:33.059
armed guards, iron bars,

17:33.083 --> 17:36.433
it tends to go downhill
rather quickly.

17:38.228 --> 17:40.106
Conjugal visits notwithstanding.

17:40.130 --> 17:42.608
But I... listen,
you want my advice?

17:42.632 --> 17:44.192
Walk away.

17:46.236 --> 17:47.513
You're young.

17:47.537 --> 17:50.516
You made a mistake.
You learn from it.

17:50.540 --> 17:54.150
Maybe next time
you'll marry smarter.

17:54.174 --> 17:57.191
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have dinner reservations.

17:57.215 --> 17:59.785
Reservation.

17:59.809 --> 18:02.228
You're eating alone, remember?

18:02.252 --> 18:04.852
And I have a feeling
it's not the first time.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.170
I'm so sorry
I couldn't get here sooner.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.677
I forgot my husband
had to take our youngest

18:16.701 --> 18:18.174
to the pediatrician and...

18:18.198 --> 18:20.176
It's all right, Mrs. Scavo.

18:20.200 --> 18:24.110
So... What did Parker do?

18:24.134 --> 18:27.421
Are you aware that your son
has an imaginary friend,

18:27.445 --> 18:29.185
a Mrs. Mulberry?

18:29.209 --> 18:31.857
Yes. We've met.

18:31.881 --> 18:34.720
Well, um, yesterday,

18:34.744 --> 18:36.222
Parker demanded that.

18:36.246 --> 18:39.595
Mrs. Mulberry get her own easel
during art, which was fine.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.227
But today it was a desk.

18:41.251 --> 18:44.600
And unfortunately,
we didn't have an extra desk.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.132
Oh.

18:46.156 --> 18:48.274
That must have been ugly.

18:48.298 --> 18:49.605
It was.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.778
Patty was rammed

18:52.802 --> 18:54.710
with this.

18:54.734 --> 18:58.214
Oh. I am so sorry.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.786
Mrs. Scavo,

19:00.810 --> 19:04.490
have you experienced
a death in your family recently?

19:04.514 --> 19:06.292
No. No. Why?

19:06.316 --> 19:08.794
Imaginary friends are often
created as a coping mechanism

19:08.818 --> 19:11.227
to... to deal with loss.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.858
Uh-huh.

19:12.882 --> 19:15.366
Or it might occur as the result
of some major change

19:15.390 --> 19:17.233
or extensive alteration
in their lives.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.234
Exactly.

19:18.258 --> 19:21.207
A manifestation of
some deep-seated unhappiness.

19:21.231 --> 19:22.508
Can you think of anything

19:22.532 --> 19:24.770
that might shed
a little bit of light

19:24.794 --> 19:26.444
on this for us?

19:30.300 --> 19:32.278
Mrs. Scavo?

19:39.709 --> 19:43.249
Thank you.

19:49.919 --> 19:51.897
And I'm thinking,
it's the golden gate bridge.

19:51.921 --> 19:54.400
What a great place to get
a picture of the sunset.

19:54.424 --> 19:57.278
So I lean outwayover
the rail to get the shot.

19:57.302 --> 19:59.275
Next thing I know,
the police arrive.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.947
People had called 9-1-1
from their cell phones.

20:01.971 --> 20:03.449
Thought I was suicidal.

20:11.341 --> 20:14.320
I can't believe how well
those two are getting along.

20:14.344 --> 20:16.322
Yeah, it's freaky.

20:16.346 --> 20:20.396
Andrew is being
polite and engaging.

20:20.420 --> 20:23.229
He's even laughing
at George's jokes.

20:23.253 --> 20:24.530
That's why it's freaky.

20:24.554 --> 20:26.441
George's jokes aren't funny.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.776
So, George,
can I ask you a question?

20:30.800 --> 20:32.278
And it's kind of personal.

20:32.302 --> 20:33.779
Sure.

20:33.803 --> 20:36.712
Have you ever actually
been with a woman?

20:36.736 --> 20:40.386
Excuse me?

20:40.410 --> 20:42.388
Well, let's be honest.
I think it's obvious

20:42.412 --> 20:44.390
by the way that you talk and act

20:44.414 --> 20:45.927
that you're not a player,

20:45.951 --> 20:47.723
so I was just curious
to find out

20:47.747 --> 20:50.296
if you had ever actually
gotten in the game.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.227
My experience with women
is none of your business.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.729
Oh, I think it is.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.731
I mean, you're dating my mom.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.733
And we both know
that at your age,

20:57.757 --> 21:00.666
dating's a little more
than just holding hands.

21:00.690 --> 21:03.238
We're not dating exactly.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.540
Oh, sure you are.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.547
And you know what?
I think it's great.

21:06.571 --> 21:08.274
But I wanna make sure
my mom's happy,

21:08.298 --> 21:10.646
you know, and it would
really set my mind at ease

21:10.670 --> 21:13.819
to know that she's with a guy
that knows how to please a lady.

21:13.843 --> 21:16.251
This is inappropriate.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.654
You know, my parents
had a great sex life.

21:18.678 --> 21:22.528
Man, I heard 'em through
the wall of my bedroom once.

21:22.552 --> 21:24.730
Please shut up.

21:24.754 --> 21:26.737
You should've heard my mom, too.

21:26.761 --> 21:28.664
She had this... this weird moan.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.318
It was kind of like, um... mmm.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.740
Unh!

21:34.764 --> 21:36.442
Isn't that bizarre?

21:36.466 --> 21:38.444
That's the sound my mom makes

21:38.468 --> 21:40.876
when she climaxes.

21:40.900 --> 21:44.450
Okay. Time for cobbler.

21:44.474 --> 21:47.683
Sorry, one of the dessert plates
doesn't match.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.815
I tried to replace it,
but it's spode Florence.

21:49.839 --> 21:51.317
It's a rare pattern.

21:51.341 --> 21:52.988
It belonged to my grandmother.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.890
But hopefully once
you taste the dessert,

21:54.914 --> 21:56.371
you'll forget all about it.

21:56.395 --> 21:58.394
I'm not hungry.

21:58.418 --> 22:02.488
George, you have to have this.
It's absolutely scrumptious.

22:05.355 --> 22:07.773
Mmm.

22:07.797 --> 22:10.005
Mmm!

22:11.801 --> 22:13.679
Go to your room!

22:13.703 --> 22:14.980
George!

22:15.004 --> 22:17.544
You heard me. Go to your room.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.516
Mr. Williams, what's wrong?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.988
Did I say something wrong?

22:23.012 --> 22:26.492
Bree, please back me up.

22:26.516 --> 22:28.694
Well, what did he say?

22:28.718 --> 22:31.348
I can't say. It's too sordid.
But he said it!

22:32.552 --> 22:34.660
Are you gonna
back me up or what?

22:34.684 --> 22:36.667
George, I can't allow you
to discipline my child

22:36.691 --> 22:39.056
if you won't even tell me
what he did.

22:43.533 --> 22:45.511
George.

22:45.535 --> 22:47.635
George!

23:02.712 --> 23:04.359
Mrs. Solis, David Bradley.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.367
Look, I feel really bad
about the tone of our meeting,

23:07.391 --> 23:10.365
so to make up for it,
I'm gonna do you a favor.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.398
The more I think of it,

23:12.422 --> 23:15.406
the more I'm convinced your
marriage is a train wreck...

23:15.430 --> 23:17.403
The gnarly type, you know,
mass casualties.

23:17.427 --> 23:18.944
Anyway, I'm passing on the name

23:18.968 --> 23:20.105
of a great divorce lawyer, kir...

23:24.904 --> 23:26.381
You have some nerve,

23:26.405 --> 23:28.383
leaving that message
on my machine.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.756
You realize this is
entirely inappropriate?

23:30.780 --> 23:32.418
I will tell you
what is inappropriate.

23:32.442 --> 23:35.429
Youmaking sweeping assumptions
about the state of my marriage.

23:35.453 --> 23:36.792
Care for a drink?

23:36.816 --> 23:38.123
No!

23:38.147 --> 23:41.897
I like to keep a clear head
when I'm telling people off.

23:41.921 --> 23:45.070
What makes you think you know
anything about me or my husband?

23:45.094 --> 23:47.077
Well, your husband's record
speaks for itself.

23:47.101 --> 23:49.775
With you, I had to rely
on my instincts.

23:49.799 --> 23:51.507
Would those be
the same instincts

23:51.531 --> 23:53.509
that picked out that Cologne?

23:53.533 --> 23:55.520
You're privileged.
You're pampered.

23:55.544 --> 23:57.412
You're spoiled.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.645
You want what you want
when you want it.

23:59.669 --> 24:01.146
You want excitement.

24:01.170 --> 24:03.489
A quickie every five months
in a prison trailer

24:03.513 --> 24:05.496
isn't gonna scratch that itch.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.993
With all due respect,
I will decide for myself

24:08.017 --> 24:10.596
what needs to be scratched
and when.

24:10.620 --> 24:12.858
Mrs. Solis, you are a beautiful,

24:12.882 --> 24:15.561
desirable woman.

24:15.585 --> 24:18.564
Now your husband is a dimwit,

24:18.588 --> 24:19.865
corrupt, violent criminal.

24:19.889 --> 24:22.568
You could do... So much better.

24:22.592 --> 24:24.740
Are you hitting on me?

24:24.764 --> 24:26.842
What would you say if I were?

24:26.866 --> 24:28.536
I'd say I'm pregnant.

24:36.646 --> 24:38.754
So I see, you're stuck.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.455
I'm not stuck, Mr. Bradley.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.549
Believe it or not,
I love my husband.

24:44.514 --> 24:47.462
I charge $700 an hour,

24:47.486 --> 24:48.694
plus xeroxing.

24:48.718 --> 24:50.195
I'll pay you 6,

24:50.219 --> 24:52.938
and I expect a conjugal visit
tomorrow by noon.

24:52.962 --> 24:54.970
Aren't you demanding?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.471
Like you said...

24:56.495 --> 24:59.875
I want what I want
when I want it.

24:59.899 --> 25:03.709
So a woman
I talked to at social services

25:03.733 --> 25:07.012
said a lot of runaways
hang out here.

25:07.036 --> 25:08.684
What?

25:08.708 --> 25:11.256
Just happy to be
spending the day with you.

25:11.280 --> 25:15.020
At homeless shelters
and bus stations?

25:15.044 --> 25:18.028
I'm gonna go ask these guys
if they've seen Zach.

25:18.052 --> 25:20.996
I think we'll cover
more ground if we split up.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.990
Okay.

25:29.258 --> 25:30.798
Thanks.

25:34.864 --> 25:38.513
Have you seen this boy?

25:38.537 --> 25:39.915
Uh, missing kid. Anyone?

25:39.939 --> 25:41.617
Going once...

25:41.641 --> 25:43.971
Going twice?

25:48.978 --> 25:51.096
Oh, do you mind keeping those

25:51.120 --> 25:55.100
and passing them out
when people get their ice cream?

25:55.124 --> 25:56.702
Huh.

25:56.726 --> 25:58.564
What?

25:58.588 --> 26:01.937
Well, isn't that him,
over there?

26:01.961 --> 26:03.569
Oh!

26:03.593 --> 26:06.011
Zach! Zach!

26:06.035 --> 26:07.613
Oh, no, no, no, no.

26:07.637 --> 26:08.974
No, no, no, no.

26:08.998 --> 26:11.246
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
Zach!

26:11.270 --> 26:13.819
Don't, don't.
Zach, don't run away!

26:13.843 --> 26:15.721
Wait! Come on!

26:15.745 --> 26:18.624
Just... would you get back here?!

26:18.648 --> 26:21.727
Come on, really!
Let's just talk!

26:21.751 --> 26:24.089
Damn it, Zach!

26:24.113 --> 26:26.632
It's enough already.

26:26.656 --> 26:28.656
Aah! Oh!

26:35.064 --> 26:36.041
Uh...

26:36.065 --> 26:38.043
Nobody here has seen Zach.

26:38.067 --> 26:39.775
But there's a halfway house

26:39.799 --> 26:42.129
on the westside
I want to check... out.

26:43.703 --> 26:44.903
Are you okay?

26:47.877 --> 26:50.786
I got you some ice cream.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.618
You did?

26:52.642 --> 26:55.142
But then I got hungry.

26:57.847 --> 27:00.687
So then I just threw
my ice cream at him and ran.

27:04.654 --> 27:06.632
Well, somebody say something.

27:06.656 --> 27:08.603
Thank god you were in flats.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.376
I'm still recovering from
Mike is Zach's real father.

27:12.902 --> 27:14.880
I should've told Mike
I saw Zach.

27:14.904 --> 27:16.651
I'm a horrible person, right?

27:16.675 --> 27:18.113
Oh, Susan, come on.

27:18.137 --> 27:21.386
Zach attacked Felicia.
He blew up your kitchen.

27:21.410 --> 27:23.388
Evidently,
he tried to kill Mike.

27:23.412 --> 27:25.412
I think we can all agree
this kid's a freak.

27:30.219 --> 27:33.659
What do you think, Bree?

27:33.683 --> 27:36.110
Well, I think given everything
that's happened,

27:36.134 --> 27:40.766
it's perfectly justified that
you'd be frightened of Zach.

27:40.790 --> 27:42.337
But...

27:42.361 --> 27:47.142
But Zach is Mary Alice's son.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.414
He grew up playing in our yards.

27:49.438 --> 27:51.646
If he has any hope of surviving,

27:51.670 --> 27:54.370
I have to believe he's better
off here than on the streets.

28:06.756 --> 28:08.033
I couldn't have imagined

28:08.057 --> 28:10.035
how much going back to work
would upset Parker.

28:10.059 --> 28:13.168
Look, he's going to be fine.
He's just gotta get used

28:13.192 --> 28:15.771
to daddy providing all the love.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.773
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.074
I am kidding.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.076
Look, kids are resilient.
He will adapt.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.078
Tom, he attacked a teacher
with an umbrella.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.750
It was a poke. He poked her.

28:24.774 --> 28:26.051
I don't know.

28:26.075 --> 28:27.783
Maybe I shouldn't be working.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.785
The kids would certainly benefit

28:29.809 --> 28:31.787
from having
two stay-at-home parents,

28:31.811 --> 28:33.789
although buying food
might become an issue.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.800
Maybe I could change
my work schedule,

28:35.824 --> 28:37.863
try and get some flex time.

28:37.887 --> 28:39.865
Would Nina go for that?

28:39.889 --> 28:41.867
No. No.

28:41.891 --> 28:43.698
No, no, no!

28:43.722 --> 28:45.030
No, no, no!

28:45.054 --> 28:48.734
It would help if you
came up with some ideas.

28:48.758 --> 28:50.876
How about hugs?

28:50.900 --> 28:53.108
Hugs? Yeah,
I read in one of those family magazines

28:53.132 --> 28:55.110
the kids are supposed
to get, like, ten hugs a day.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.751
It makes 'em feel more secure.

28:56.775 --> 28:58.944
I say pile on the hugs.

28:58.968 --> 29:00.715
That'll fix everything? Hugs?

29:00.739 --> 29:03.749
Yeah. Come here.

29:06.315 --> 29:08.723
Come here.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.326
Hey.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.850
Hi.

29:14.223 --> 29:16.201
It's working, isn't it?

29:16.225 --> 29:17.825
Shut up.

29:27.937 --> 29:30.776
Hey, buddy, you busy?

29:30.800 --> 29:33.779
Yes. Mrs. Mulberry's
reading to me.

29:33.803 --> 29:35.520
Well, isn't she nice?

29:35.544 --> 29:38.261
But it's time for bed, so I'm
gonna tuck you in, okay?

29:38.285 --> 29:39.925
I'll take that.

29:39.949 --> 29:40.949
No!

29:48.387 --> 29:51.366
I know things
have been hard for you

29:51.390 --> 29:53.368
since I started back to work,

29:53.392 --> 29:56.409
but it is just as hard for me
to be away from you.

29:56.433 --> 29:59.374
And you just have to remember

29:59.398 --> 30:02.107
that even when I'm not around,

30:02.131 --> 30:04.880
my love for you is real.

30:04.904 --> 30:07.182
You may not be able to see it,

30:07.206 --> 30:09.815
but it's not imaginary
like Mrs. Mulberry.

30:09.839 --> 30:11.879
It's real.

30:13.983 --> 30:15.260
Okay, honey?

30:15.284 --> 30:19.794
Mrs. Mulberryisreal,
and she said you're a liar.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.218
Parker.

30:26.996 --> 30:28.473
Parker.

30:28.497 --> 30:30.397
We're reading.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.918
I don't understand.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.450
Why can't we see each other
anymore?

30:45.474 --> 30:48.858
Because ever since I found out
what Andrew said to you,

30:48.882 --> 30:51.056
I've been doing
some soul searching,

30:51.080 --> 30:53.058
and I realize that
everything's that happened

30:53.082 --> 30:54.599
is completely my fault.

30:54.623 --> 30:57.337
No, no, no,
that's ridiculous. No, it's not.

30:57.361 --> 30:59.334
All the things
that Andrew's been saying

30:59.358 --> 31:00.966
and the way he's been acting,

31:00.990 --> 31:03.138
it's all connected
to his father's death.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.839
And it's clear to me

31:04.863 --> 31:07.380
that I need to spend more time
focusing on him and his needs.

31:07.404 --> 31:10.015
You know...

31:10.039 --> 31:12.878
You're right. You do need
to focus on Andrew.

31:12.902 --> 31:16.251
Thank you, George,
for being so understanding.

31:16.275 --> 31:17.975
Of course.

31:21.410 --> 31:23.929
So have you thought
about counseling?

31:23.953 --> 31:25.891
That place you sent him to...

31:25.915 --> 31:27.893
That behavioral
modification camp...

31:27.917 --> 31:30.035
He got counseling there, right?

31:30.059 --> 31:31.937
But I only sent him there

31:31.961 --> 31:35.100
because his behavior at the time
was so completely out of bounds.

31:35.124 --> 31:38.451
You don't think that what
he said to me was out of bounds?

31:38.475 --> 31:41.977
I just think if I spent
a lot of time with him,

31:42.001 --> 31:43.878
it'll really help.
Why not do both?

31:43.902 --> 31:45.880
Let him spend a few months
with some caring professionals,

31:45.904 --> 31:47.882
and then bring him home.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.885
You know, what he said
to you was horribly rude,

31:50.909 --> 31:52.387
but that camp, it's extreme,

31:52.411 --> 31:54.889
and, I mean, unless I felt
like Andrew was getting

31:54.913 --> 31:58.293
really out of control, then...

32:00.019 --> 32:02.419
Well, let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

32:04.693 --> 32:06.680
You know, in spite of
everything that's happened,

32:06.704 --> 32:08.934
I really like Andrew.

32:08.958 --> 32:10.976
Oh, George, really?

32:11.000 --> 32:12.938
Yeah. The truth is...

32:12.962 --> 32:16.442
He reminds me of me.

32:18.407 --> 32:20.385
The conjugal visit rules are
you got 45 minutes.

32:20.409 --> 32:22.988
We call every 15 minutes
to make sure you're still here.

32:23.012 --> 32:24.289
You understand?

32:24.313 --> 32:25.991
Yes, we got it.

32:26.015 --> 32:27.993
Uh, we interrupt our lovemaking
to answer the phone,

32:28.017 --> 32:30.956
or you call out the dogs. Okay!

32:30.980 --> 32:33.498
I'm ready whenever you...

32:33.522 --> 32:35.122
Obviously are.

32:45.534 --> 32:49.214
Carlos, are we gonna make it?

32:49.238 --> 32:52.417
We just did.
You want to go again?

32:52.441 --> 32:57.122
No, I'm talking about us...

32:57.146 --> 33:00.555
Our relationship, our marriage.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.257
Carlos, you're going
to be a father.

33:02.281 --> 33:05.960
And when you get outta here,
you're gonna need to get a job

33:05.984 --> 33:09.564
and make an honest living
for me and our child.

33:09.588 --> 33:12.437
Babe, I've learned my lesson.

33:12.461 --> 33:15.500
Okay, when I get out of here,
everything's gonna be different.

33:15.524 --> 33:19.308
We're going to start over with
a new life and a great family,

33:19.332 --> 33:22.068
and nothing is going to
get in the way of that.

33:28.777 --> 33:30.755
Hey, so you never told me...

33:30.779 --> 33:33.309
How's the new lawyer?
You like him?

33:40.549 --> 33:42.097
Yeah.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.521
Yeah, I'm still here.

33:46.125 --> 33:51.536
Okay, enough chitchat.
We only have 30 minutes left,

33:51.560 --> 33:54.600
and I want to make
the most of it.

34:08.746 --> 34:11.056
Okay, please... please don't run.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.627
I can't. I hurt my foot.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.559
How?

34:14.583 --> 34:18.402
I landed on it funny when
I was running away from you.

34:18.427 --> 34:20.635
What do you want?

34:20.659 --> 34:22.407
To talk to you.

34:22.431 --> 34:24.109
Why?

34:24.132 --> 34:25.409
'Cause I have
a lot of things to say.

34:25.434 --> 34:28.181
So you can just listen.
I'll buy you some food.

34:28.205 --> 34:31.266
When was the last time you ate?

34:37.806 --> 34:40.755
My dad's alive? Where is he?

34:40.779 --> 34:43.128
I don't know. He disappeared.

34:43.152 --> 34:45.590
But Mike did not kill him.
I mean, he's alive, you swear?

34:45.614 --> 34:48.163
I swear. Maybe he's in Utah.

34:48.187 --> 34:51.136
I know that he used to
have a life there...

34:51.159 --> 34:52.437
Before me.

34:52.460 --> 34:54.438
I don't know. I just... I just...

34:54.463 --> 34:56.610
I need to get some money
and find him.

34:56.634 --> 34:58.773
Zach, you know what I think?

34:58.797 --> 35:01.746
I think you should come
back with me. Why?

35:01.770 --> 35:04.349
Because there are still people
at home that care about you.

35:04.373 --> 35:06.560
And there's things
that you need to know.

35:06.584 --> 35:08.853
Like what?

35:08.877 --> 35:11.216
Well, I can't tell you.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.588
You know, you messed up
a lot of people's lives, Zach.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.820
You can't run away from that.

35:15.844 --> 35:18.092
Do you mean Julie?

35:18.116 --> 35:19.216
What?

35:21.420 --> 35:24.129
I know that I messed up
her life,

35:24.153 --> 35:26.131
but I didn't mean to.

35:26.155 --> 35:29.174
I really miss her out here.

35:29.198 --> 35:31.536
I think about her all the time.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.239
Yeah, well, Julie's
a really special girl.

35:34.263 --> 35:36.246
Has she said anything about me?

35:36.270 --> 35:39.135
Because if she has, then I might
still have a chance with her.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.117
If I come back with you,

35:43.141 --> 35:45.411
then I-I could
make it up to her.

35:48.177 --> 35:51.756
Do you know what I think?

35:51.780 --> 35:54.128
I think you were right.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.139
I think you should
try to find your father first.

35:57.163 --> 36:00.134
Yeah? Yeah.

36:00.158 --> 36:04.138
I mean,
now that you know he's okay,

36:04.162 --> 36:06.341
you should go to him.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.673
He'll want to take care of you.

36:08.697 --> 36:10.837
That's what parents do.

36:13.642 --> 36:17.322
Let me help.

36:17.346 --> 36:20.176
How much money do you think
you'll need to get to Utah?

37:17.936 --> 37:20.685
Daddy, I can't find
Mrs. Mulberry's umbrella.

37:20.709 --> 37:22.587
Where is it?

37:22.611 --> 37:25.390
Oh, I don't know, sport. Honey,
have you seen the umbrella?

37:25.414 --> 37:28.323
No, can't say that I have.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.295
Okay, listen,
don't worry about it.

37:30.319 --> 37:32.397
I'm sure Mrs. Mulberry's
around here somewhere.

37:32.421 --> 37:34.921
Or, uh, maybe she's not.

37:36.485 --> 37:40.605
She could've left. You know...

37:40.629 --> 37:42.607
Maybe she had some
other little boy

37:42.631 --> 37:44.609
that she needed to help.

37:44.633 --> 37:46.271
Like who?

37:46.295 --> 37:48.673
I don't know. It could be
a little boy in, uh...

37:48.697 --> 37:50.675
England...

37:50.699 --> 37:52.469
Named... Spencer.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.350
Lynette?

37:55.374 --> 37:58.353
I mean, this is
conjecture on my part.

37:58.377 --> 38:03.428
But it is possible that
someonelikelittle Spencer

38:03.452 --> 38:08.032
needs Mrs. Mulberry more,
'cause he doesn't have a daddy

38:08.056 --> 38:10.395
and a mommy who love him.

38:10.419 --> 38:12.297
Yeah, that's it.

38:12.321 --> 38:14.899
He's an orphan...

38:14.923 --> 38:17.672
With no hands.

38:17.696 --> 38:18.696
Okay?

38:20.429 --> 38:23.778
You're so sweet. Come here.
I love you. You all right?

38:23.802 --> 38:25.410
Okay, go get dressed.

38:25.434 --> 38:28.313
What have you done
to Mrs. Mulberry?

38:28.337 --> 38:33.377
Until there's a body,
there's no evidence of a crime.

38:35.984 --> 38:37.492
Mrs. Mulberry!

38:37.516 --> 38:38.893
She's back!

38:38.917 --> 38:41.326
Oh!

38:41.350 --> 38:42.467
Goodie.

38:42.491 --> 38:43.851
Mrs. Mulberry's back!

38:57.836 --> 38:59.744
Oh!

38:59.768 --> 39:01.916
She got ran over. She's dead.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.819
Don't you worry. I'm here.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.060
Maybe it's okay, buddy.
Maybe we can call 9-1-1 or...

39:07.084 --> 39:10.045
No, Tom, she's gone.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.349
Swimmers, take your marks.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.356
George, what are you doing here?

39:37.380 --> 39:39.083
Don't worry, Bree,
I'll be quick.

39:39.107 --> 39:41.756
I thought about what you said,
and you're right.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.489
Andrew needs his space.

39:44.513 --> 39:45.930
Well, thank you, George.

39:45.954 --> 39:48.593
It's... Best that I stay away.

39:48.617 --> 39:51.135
And I completely understand

39:51.159 --> 39:52.767
if you want to change
pharmacists but...

39:52.791 --> 39:55.369
I did want to give you
a little good-bye gift.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.441
Oh.

40:02.731 --> 40:04.849
George!

40:04.873 --> 40:06.460
It's my pattern!
Where did you find it?

40:06.484 --> 40:08.905
I got lucky
on an online auction.

40:13.081 --> 40:15.590
I love it! Thank you! Oh!

40:15.614 --> 40:17.624
George?

40:22.791 --> 40:24.969
Oh, George!

40:24.993 --> 40:26.801
George.

40:26.825 --> 40:27.895
George.

40:33.762 --> 40:35.440
Andrew, what are you doing?!

40:35.464 --> 40:37.542
Aah! Aah!

40:37.566 --> 40:38.936
Andrew!

40:40.769 --> 40:42.439
Get off of him, Andrew!

40:44.643 --> 40:46.651
Stop it!

40:46.675 --> 40:48.575
Knock it off!

40:49.548 --> 40:51.756
Did you see him?!
He was kissing her!

40:51.780 --> 40:53.528
Oh, my god, you're bleeding.

40:53.552 --> 40:55.530
That freak was kissing her!

40:55.554 --> 40:57.994
I don't care.
You gotta calm down now.

41:10.799 --> 41:14.479
The world is filled
with good fathers.

41:14.503 --> 41:16.681
How do we recognize them?

41:16.705 --> 41:20.685
They're the ones
who are missed so terribly

41:20.709 --> 41:25.049
that everything falls apart
in their absence.

41:27.656 --> 41:30.835
They're the ones who love us

41:30.859 --> 41:35.089
long before we've even arrived.

41:36.665 --> 41:40.805
They're the ones
who come looking for us

41:40.829 --> 41:44.529
when we can't find our way home.

41:50.979 --> 41:52.739
Hey, what's wrong?

41:54.983 --> 41:56.821
Because of me,

41:56.845 --> 42:02.645
my son's imaginary friend
got crushed by a garbage truck.

42:05.624 --> 42:09.774
I am the worst person
in the world.

42:09.798 --> 42:12.807
Yes, the world is filled
with good fathers...

42:12.831 --> 42:16.911
Honey, he is going to get
over this in no time. Trust me.

42:16.935 --> 42:21.515
And one day
when he is all grown up,

42:21.539 --> 42:25.590
you and Parker are going to
laugh hysterically about this.

42:25.614 --> 42:28.052
You really think so? Really?

42:28.076 --> 42:30.054
And the best

42:30.078 --> 42:32.557
are the ones who make
the women in their lives...

42:32.581 --> 42:34.228
I promise.

42:34.252 --> 42:36.252
Feel like good mothers.
