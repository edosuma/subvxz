WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.103
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.103 --> 00:04.775
YOUR EX-HUSBAND WAS
PART OWNER IN A BUSINESS.

00:04.775 --> 00:07.378
SUSAN CAME INTO AN INHERITANCE.

00:07.378 --> 00:11.382
WHO DO I SPEAK TO ABOUT SELLING
MY SHARE OF HERPES ON PARADE?

00:11.382 --> 00:13.684
LYNETTE ACQUIESCED...

00:13.684 --> 00:17.548
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE GOING
TO THERAPY TOGETHER.
 THAT IS GREAT NEWS!
THANK YOU.

00:17.548 --> 00:19.290
AS SOON AS GRADUATE
HIGH SCHOOL,

00:19.290 --> 00:21.452
I'M GOING TO NEW YORK
TO BE A MODEL.

00:21.452 --> 00:24.024
ANGIE'S CONCERNS
MADE HER MORE PROTECTIVE.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.098
YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS FELT BAD
ABOUT THE WAY WE'VE HAD

00:27.098 --> 00:29.300
TO RAISE YOU,
BEING ON THE RUN AND ALL.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.062
THE DOOR STAYS OPEN.

00:31.062 --> 00:33.304
I WANT IT CLOSED.
 YOU STINK.

00:33.304 --> 00:35.436
AND YOU'RE A WHORE!
HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.808
I CAN GET CLEAN.
 MM.

00:37.808 --> 00:40.241
STOP!
 SAY "PLEASE."

00:40.241 --> 00:42.743
AND ORSON EXPRESSED
HIS FEELINGS.
 PLEASE!

00:42.743 --> 00:45.045
THAT'S THE LIFE
I'M FACING NOW--

00:45.045 --> 00:47.118
HAVING TO ASK PEOPLE FOR HELP,
FOR EVERYTHING.

00:47.118 --> 00:49.620
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD
THAT IS?!

00:54.155 --> 00:58.159
(Mary Alice) ORSON HODGE
WAS SMILING AGAIN,

00:58.159 --> 01:01.332
AND IT WAS STARTING TO WORRY
HIS WIFE.

01:03.834 --> 01:06.567
YOU SEE, SINCE HIS ACCIDENT,

01:06.567 --> 01:08.569
BREE HODGE HAD GROWN ACCUSTOMED

01:08.569 --> 01:11.272
TO HER HUSBAND'S
SEVERE MOOD SWINGS.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.405
AAH!

01:14.405 --> 01:17.708
SHE HAD GROWN USED TO
HIS UNEXPECTED RAGE...

01:17.708 --> 01:19.210
(sobbing)

01:19.210 --> 01:21.812
HIS SUDDEN ANGUISH...

01:23.254 --> 01:26.357
HIS DEEP DEPRESSION.

01:26.357 --> 01:31.222
BUT LATELY, AN ODD TRANQUILITY
HAD SETTLED OVER ORSON,

01:31.222 --> 01:35.566
AND HIS WIFE HAD THE FEELING
SOMETHING WAS TERRIBLY WRONG.

01:35.566 --> 01:39.700
SADLY, SHE WAS RIGHT.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.803
(speaks indistinctly)

01:42.803 --> 01:45.736
WHAT'S, UM, GOING ON HERE?

01:45.736 --> 01:47.838
HELLO, BREE.

01:47.838 --> 01:50.841
JUST THOUGHT I'D GIVE AWAY SOME
THINGS I DON'T NEED ANYMORE.

01:50.841 --> 01:54.185
HEY, ORSON.
YOU GOT THESE IN 8 1/2?

01:54.185 --> 01:57.117
SORRY, ROY.
WE JUST CARRY MEN'S SIZES.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.249
(laughter)

01:58.249 --> 01:59.750
LOOK, I CAN UNDERSTAND

01:59.750 --> 02:02.753
WHY YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE AWAY
YOUR SPORTING EQUIPMENT,

02:02.753 --> 02:06.197
BUT WHY WOULD YOU GIVE AWAY
YOUR BOOKS AND YOUR CDs?

02:06.197 --> 02:09.400
AND FOR GOD SAKES, YOU CAN
STILL USE YOUR HEADPHONES.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.462
(loudly) THESE ARE AMAZING!

02:11.462 --> 02:13.864
GIVE ME THOSE.
 OW!

02:13.864 --> 02:16.437
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?

02:16.437 --> 02:18.909
DON'T YOU REALIZE
YOU'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE

02:18.909 --> 02:21.272
OF A MAN WHO IS
EMOTIONALLY DISTRAUGHT?

02:21.272 --> 02:24.545
HE SEEMED TO BE
IN A GREAT MOOD.
 UNTIL LADY SUNSHINE
WALKED IN.

02:24.545 --> 02:28.549
WE'RE SORRY, BREE. WE ASSUMED
YOU GUYS HAD TALKED ABOUT IT.
 WELL, WE DIDN'T, AND THAT
DOESN'T EXCUSE THE FACT

02:28.549 --> 02:30.881
THAT YOU'RE ALL ACTING
LIKE A BUNCH OF VULTURES.

02:30.881 --> 02:32.883
IT'S A GOOD THING I CAME HOME,

02:32.883 --> 02:35.256
OR YOU'D BE
PICKING THROUGH HIS CLOSET.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.628
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS?

02:37.628 --> 02:38.929
WE SHOULD GO.

02:38.929 --> 02:41.792
AND PLEASE LEAVE
YOUR PLUNDER BEHIND.

02:41.792 --> 02:45.566
HEY, COME ON. AT MY AGE,
IT'S JUST A SHORT-TERM LOAN.

02:49.740 --> 02:51.802
(door closes)

02:51.802 --> 02:54.475
WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU?

02:54.475 --> 02:55.776
I'M SORRY, DARLING.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.309
I HAD NO INTENTION
OF UPSETTING YOU.

02:58.309 --> 03:00.881
KEEP MY THINGS,
GIVE THEM AWAY.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.514
ULTIMATELY,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

03:03.514 --> 03:07.888
YES, ORSON HODGE
WAS SMILING AGAIN,

03:07.888 --> 03:11.892
AND BREE WOULD SOON LEARN
THE REASON WHY.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.625
YOU SEE, HER HUSBAND...

03:14.625 --> 03:17.798
HAD DECIDED TO KILL HIMSELF.

03:33.384 --> 03:37.217
IN THIS NEVER-ENDING DRAMA
WE CALL LIFE,

03:37.217 --> 03:40.451
EVERYONE HAS A PART TO PLAY.

03:40.451 --> 03:44.795
SOME ARE CAST
AS ROMANTIC LEADS.

03:44.795 --> 03:47.698
OTHERS END UP
PLAYING THE VICTIM.

03:47.698 --> 03:50.661
(cries)

03:50.661 --> 03:53.904
(door closes)
 AND A FEW PROVIDE COMIC RELIEF.

03:56.507 --> 04:00.311
BUT IF THE DRAMA IS TO BE
REALLY COMPELLING,

04:00.311 --> 04:04.815
THERE MUST BE A HERO...
AND A VILLAIN.

04:06.277 --> 04:08.018
HEY, MRS. KINSKY.

04:08.018 --> 04:10.481
OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

04:10.481 --> 04:12.353
THE GARBAGE POLICE.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.355
I HATE TO BUG YOU,

04:14.355 --> 04:18.329
BUT YOU'RE STILL NOT SEPARATING
YOUR GLASS AND PLASTICS.

04:18.329 --> 04:21.362
THE CITY PASSED
THAT ORDINANCE, REMEMBER?

04:21.362 --> 04:23.334
HOW I ENVY YOU--

04:23.334 --> 04:26.737
YOUNG, PRETTY, ABLE TO CROUCH
FOR HOURS BEHIND A BUSH,

04:26.737 --> 04:29.039
WAITING FOR A NEIGHBOR
TO DUMP HER TRASH.

04:29.039 --> 04:32.543
LOOK, MAYBE YOU DON'T GET
HOW EASY IT IS TO RECYCLE.

04:32.543 --> 04:35.646
OH, I GET IT.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
 (slams lid shut)

04:35.646 --> 04:37.648
I'VE BEEN THROWING STYROFOAM
INTO THE TRASH

04:37.648 --> 04:39.650
SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN,

04:39.650 --> 04:42.052
AND THE SKY IS STILL BLUE
AND THE GRASS IS STILL GREEN.

04:42.052 --> 04:44.785
MAYBE NOW, BUT WHAT WILL IT BE
LIKE FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.787
MY SON IS SHOOTING BLANKS,

04:46.787 --> 04:48.789
AND MY DAUGHTER LIKES
THE LADIES.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.922
(chuckles) GRANDKIDS ARE
THE LEAST OF MY CONCERNS.

04:51.922 --> 04:54.695
SO YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT OUR PLANET AT ALL?
 BY THE TIME IT'S A PROBLEM,
I'LL BE LONG GONE.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.768
LET THE COCKROACHES
AND THE ROBOTS FIGHT OVER IT.

04:57.768 --> 05:00.300
(laughs)

05:05.706 --> 05:07.708
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

05:07.708 --> 05:09.680
OH, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:09.680 --> 05:14.685
COME ON. LOOK, ONE OLD CRANK
DOESN'T WANT TO RECYCLE.

05:14.685 --> 05:17.017
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT STUFF
ANYMORE, REMEMBER?

05:17.017 --> 05:20.020
OF COURSE I STILL CARE.
 Y--FINE. YEAH, YOU CAN CARE.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.993
JUST... DON'T BE
BLOWING OUR COVER.

05:22.993 --> 05:24.995
SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO?

05:24.995 --> 05:28.629
STAND BACK AND WATCH HER
DEFILE OUR PLANET?

05:28.629 --> 05:30.931
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

05:32.963 --> 05:35.666
"SOMETIMES YOU--YOU CHAIN
YOURSELF TO THE TREE,

05:35.666 --> 05:38.669
AND SOMETIMES YOU GO AFTER
THE GUY WITH THE SAW."

05:40.010 --> 05:42.413
THAT'S WHAT PATRICK
USED TO SAY.

05:42.413 --> 05:45.676
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT PATRICK
ANYMORE.

05:45.676 --> 05:48.719
I'M JUST SAYING.
 SO AM I.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.885
(dance music playing)

05:54.885 --> 05:59.059
(men hooting and whistling)
 SO THE LAWYER SAYS
YOU SIGN RIGHT HERE,

05:59.059 --> 06:02.793
AND YOU ARE OFFICIALLY BOUGHT
OUT OF THE STRIP CLUB BUSINESS.

06:02.793 --> 06:06.837
LET'S HOPE I DON'T GET
MY SHARE IN SINGLES.
 (laughs)

06:06.837 --> 06:09.770
AND HERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER US BY.

06:09.770 --> 06:13.504
"LAP DANCING...
IT'S A GRIND." (chuckles)

06:13.504 --> 06:15.476
WELL, I WILL BE SURE
TO WEAR THIS

06:15.476 --> 06:18.849
ON THE NEXT FIELD TRIP I TAKE
WITH MY STUDENTS. THANKS, JIMBO.

06:18.849 --> 06:21.652
GOOD LUCK.
 YOU, TOO.

06:21.652 --> 06:24.755
BYE, MRS. D.
 TAKE CARE, ROBIN.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.489
"MOBY DICK"?

06:28.489 --> 06:31.592
NO, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
IT'S ABOUT A WHALE.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.525
YES, I KNOW.
UH, IT'S A CLASSIC.

06:34.525 --> 06:36.527
WELL, I SAW AN ARTICLE ABOUT

06:36.527 --> 06:38.529
A HUNDRED BOOKS YOU SHOULD
READ BEFORE DYING,

06:38.529 --> 06:40.531
AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,

06:40.531 --> 06:42.933
WITH ALL THE HIGH CHOLESTEROL
IN MY FAMILY,

06:42.933 --> 06:45.636
I BETTER GET CRACKIN'.
 OH, GOOD FOR YOU.

06:45.636 --> 06:48.639
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

06:48.639 --> 06:51.942
OH, UM, UH, WELL, THIS WAS,
UH, NEVER REALLY MY JOB.

06:51.942 --> 06:54.114
I'M ACTUALLY A TEACHER.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.646
REALLY?
 MM-HMM.

06:55.646 --> 06:58.749
OH, THAT IS SO COOL.
I THOUGHT ABOUT BEING A TEACHER.

06:58.749 --> 07:00.791
I ACTUALLY WENT
A COUPLE SEMESTERS,

07:00.791 --> 07:02.793
BUT THEN MY FAMILY HAD
SOME MONEY PROBLEMS,

07:02.793 --> 07:06.096
AND, WELL, NINE YEARS LATER,
I'M STILL WEARING TASSELS.

07:06.096 --> 07:09.560
ROBIN, YOU'RE BEING REQUESTED
IN THE V.I.P. LOUNGE.

07:17.167 --> 07:20.711
WELL, UM, GOOD LUCK
WITH THOSE HUNDRED BOOKS.

07:20.711 --> 07:22.212
THANK YOU.
 (chuckles)

07:22.212 --> 07:25.215
OH, NOT THIS GUY AGAIN.

07:25.215 --> 07:27.548
I KEEP TELLING HIM
TO KEEP THE TIPS

07:27.548 --> 07:29.550
AND BUY HIMSELF
A TOOTHBRUSH.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.052
ROBIN, WAIT.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.724
UM...

07:33.724 --> 07:37.528
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP DOING
THIS IF IT MAKES YOU UNHAPPY.

07:37.528 --> 07:41.461
WELL, I'VE GOT BILLS TO PAY,
MRS. DELFINO.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.464
NO, I KNOW, BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORK HERE.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.467
YOU COULD DO ANYTHING
YOU WANT.
 THAT'S EASY TO SAY.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.899
WELL, I MEAN IT.

07:48.899 --> 07:51.902
IT IS NEVER TOO LATE
TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

07:54.044 --> 07:56.146
ROBIN, NOW.

08:03.554 --> 08:04.855
THANK YOU.

08:04.855 --> 08:06.717
MM.

08:06.717 --> 08:08.719
YOU'RE TAKING THAT
WITH YOU?

08:08.719 --> 08:10.260
WHEN CUSTOMERS GET GRABBY,

08:10.260 --> 08:12.863
I LIKE TO HAVE SOMETHING
TO WHACK 'EM WITH.

08:12.863 --> 08:16.226
I ALMOST KILLED A GUY WITH
"WAR AND PEACE." (chuckles)
 (chuckles)

08:16.226 --> 08:18.669
HMM.

08:20.631 --> 08:22.132
SO I'M DRIVING.

08:22.132 --> 08:25.075
TH-THIS GUYS PULLS OUT
IN FRONT OF ME.
 CUTS HIM OFF.

08:25.075 --> 08:28.579
YES. (sighs)
I WAS A LITTLE PISSED.
 YOU WERE FURIOUS.

08:28.579 --> 08:31.682
BUT AT THE STOPLIGHT, WHEN I
START TO TELL THE GUY OFF,

08:31.682 --> 08:34.183
TOM LEANS OVER AND SAYS,
"SORRY. UH, NO BIG DEAL.

08:34.183 --> 08:37.818
SHE'S JUST HAVING A BAD DAY."
 YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
TAKE THE GUY'S HEAD OFF.

08:37.818 --> 08:41.051
HE WAS A MANIAC.
 SHE FLIPPED HIM THE BIRD.

08:41.051 --> 08:44.054
I WAS STICKING UP FOR YOU!
 YES, BUT TOM WAS DRIVING,
LYNETTE.

08:44.054 --> 08:46.056
WHETHER HE CHOSE TO IGNORE IT

08:46.056 --> 08:48.799
OR TRY TO RUN THE MAN
OFF THE ROAD, IT'S HIS DECISION.

08:48.799 --> 08:50.801
LET HIM BE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT
SOMETIMES,

08:50.801 --> 08:54.064
LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY.

08:56.166 --> 09:00.911
BRINGING THE SCORE TO TOM--4
AND CONTROLLING BITCH--0.

09:00.911 --> 09:03.744
THERE'S NO SCOREBOARD
IN THIS ROOM. YOU KNOW THAT.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.949
WELL, I THINK YOU BOTH DID
SOME GREAT WORK TODAY.

09:08.949 --> 09:13.123
NEXT TUESDAY, SAME TIME?
 THANKS, DOCTOR. IT FELT
REALLY GREAT. (chuckles)

09:13.123 --> 09:14.825
YEAH, GREAT.

09:18.088 --> 09:21.632
I ALWAYS FEEL SO MUCH BETTER
WHEN WE GET OUT OF THERE.

09:21.632 --> 09:24.094
YEAH, I BET YOU DO.
 WELL, DON'T YOU?

09:24.094 --> 09:26.937
I MEAN, I REALLY THINK
SHE GOT THIS... WORKING.

09:26.937 --> 09:29.800
YEAH, I THINK
SHE'S GOT THIS... WORKING

09:29.800 --> 09:32.002
AND THIS...
IS GETTING BEAT UP.

09:32.002 --> 09:34.775
COME ON, LYNETTE.
DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.778
IT'S TRUE. SHE ALWAYS SIDES WITH
YOU. I WANT A SECOND OPINION.
 LYNETTE.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.880
MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT
SEEING ANOTHER THERAPIST.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.613
WHEN WE STARTED,
YOU LOVED HER.

09:42.613 --> 09:44.915
YEAH, AND WHEN WE STARTED,
I LOVED YOU, TOO.

09:44.915 --> 09:47.688
THINGS CHANGE.
NOW LET'S GO.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.790
HOLD ON. UH...

09:49.790 --> 09:52.292
I THINK I LEFT MY KEYS.

09:53.964 --> 09:56.727
NO, I CAN'T. I HAVE
DRESS REHEARSAL TONIGHT.

09:56.727 --> 09:59.970
(knock on door)
 OKAY. TALK TO YOU LATER.

09:59.970 --> 10:01.702
I'M SORRY.
I FORGOT MY KEYS.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.273
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

10:03.273 --> 10:04.705
(chuckles)
 (keys jangle)

10:04.705 --> 10:06.977
UM, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO EAVESDROP.

10:06.977 --> 10:10.040
DID YOU SAY YOU HAD
DRESS REHEARSAL?

10:10.040 --> 10:11.311
OH, THAT.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.314
YES, I'M SORT OF IN A LITTLE
PLAY THAT RUNS THIS WEEKEND.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.717
REALLY?
YOU'RE AN ACTOR, TOO?

10:16.717 --> 10:18.719
WELL, I DABBLED IN COLLEGE.

10:18.719 --> 10:21.321
I HAVE A BIT OF A GIFT,
SO I TRY TO KEEP IT ALIVE.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.795
WOW, WHAT'S THE PLAY? I MEAN,
WE'D--WE'D LOVE TO COME SEE IT.

10:24.795 --> 10:26.897
"ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA." BUT IT'S
JUST A COMMUNITY PRODUCTION.

10:26.897 --> 10:28.899
I WOULD NEVER FORCE YOU
TO SIT THROUGH IT.

10:28.899 --> 10:31.732
OH, OKAY. WELL, IF YOU DON'T
WANT US TO COME...

10:31.732 --> 10:35.365
HERE'S A FLYER.
MATINEES ARE HALF-OFF.

10:35.365 --> 10:38.038
(doorbell rings)

10:38.038 --> 10:41.041
HEY.
 HEY! I NEED ANA
TO WATCH THE GIRLS

10:41.041 --> 10:43.043
WHILE I RUN TO THE STORE,

10:43.043 --> 10:46.176
AND BIG SHOCK--
SHE'S NOT ANSWERING HER CELL.
 OH, NO PROBLEM. COME ON IN.

10:46.176 --> 10:49.419
THEY'RE JUST
UP IN DANNY'S ROOM.

10:49.419 --> 10:52.052
ANA!

10:52.052 --> 10:54.825
GABY'S HERE!

10:54.825 --> 10:56.927
SO THEY'RE IN DANNY'S ROOM?

10:56.927 --> 10:59.129
OH, YEAH.
THEY WERE LISTENING TO MUSIC.

10:59.129 --> 11:01.832
IT WAS SO LOUD,
I MADE THEM SHUT THE DOOR.

11:01.832 --> 11:03.834
AH. SO THEY'RE
BY THEMSELVES...

11:03.834 --> 11:05.696
WITH THE DOOR SHUT?

11:05.696 --> 11:09.299
JUST A COUPLE OF TEENAGERS
ALONE WITH THEIR GENITALS?

11:11.171 --> 11:14.074
ANA!
GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE!

11:14.074 --> 11:16.076
GABY, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

11:16.076 --> 11:19.309
THEY'RE JUST HANGING OUT
IN DANNY'S ROOM.
 WITH A MATTRESS.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CRACK

11:19.309 --> 11:21.311
A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE
ON ANA'S PELVIS

11:21.311 --> 11:23.313
AND WISH DANNY A BON VOYAGE?

11:23.313 --> 11:25.155
ANA! NOW!

11:25.155 --> 11:27.417
(door opens)
 (Ana) HOLD ON. I'M COMING.

11:27.417 --> 11:30.791
(rock playing indistinctly)
 I'M SURE SHE MEANT
SHE'S ON HER WAY.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.764
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:33.764 --> 11:37.127
I HAVE TO RUN TO THE STORE.
I NEED YOU TO WATCH THE GIRLS.

11:37.127 --> 11:40.130
THAT'S IT? JEEZ, I THOUGHT
THE HOUSE WAS ON FIRE.

11:40.130 --> 11:42.803
LET ME GRAB MY STUFF.

11:42.803 --> 11:46.306
SO... YOU WORRIED
THEY MIGHT BE DOING IT?

11:46.306 --> 11:48.909
YEAH. WHAT I DON'T GET IS
WHY YOU'RE NOT WORRIED.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.041
THEY ARE
HEALTHY, RED-BLOODED KIDS.

11:51.041 --> 11:54.444
THEY'RE GONNA DO
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO.
 SO WE SAY NOTHING
AND JUST FLUFF THEIR PILLOWS?

11:54.444 --> 11:57.287
NO. WE MAKE SURE THEY DON'T
DO ANYTHING STUPID.

11:57.287 --> 11:59.349
HAVE YOU GOTTEN ANA
BIRTH CONTROL?

11:59.349 --> 12:01.852
I MAKE HER SPEND TIME
WITH JUANITA AND CELIA.

12:01.852 --> 12:05.055
I WAS HOPING THAT WOULD DO IT.
 COME ON, GABY.

12:05.055 --> 12:08.258
Y-YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HER
ABOUT SAFE SEX, CONDOMS.

12:08.258 --> 12:10.831
SHE'S ONLY 17.
SHE'S TOO YOUNG!

12:10.831 --> 12:13.864
OH. HOW OLD WERE YOU
WHEN YOU FIRST DID IT?

12:16.306 --> 12:18.969
ANA, HURRY UP!

12:18.969 --> 12:21.842
GOTTA HIT THE PHARMACY,
TOO!

12:21.842 --> 12:24.114
(sighs)

12:34.855 --> 12:36.026
(wheels squeak)

12:36.026 --> 12:38.458
OH.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.031
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU COME IN.

12:41.031 --> 12:43.763
"DEAREST BREE,
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU,

12:43.763 --> 12:46.066
"BUT THE WILL TO FIGHT ON
HAS LEFT ME,

12:46.066 --> 12:49.800
SO I'VE CHOSEN TO...
EXIT LIFE ON MY OWN TERMS."

12:49.800 --> 12:51.802
IS THIS A SUICIDE NOTE?

12:51.802 --> 12:55.275
WELL, IT'S REALLY MORE
OF A SUICIDE ROUGH DRAFT.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.178
OH, MY GOD.

12:58.178 --> 13:01.181
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU
TO FIND OUT THIS WAY.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.253
BUT NOW THAT YOU KNOW,

13:03.253 --> 13:07.357
AT LEAST WE CAN DISCUSS IT
LIKE ADULTS.
 THERE IS NOTHING TO DISCUSS.

13:07.357 --> 13:09.389
ORSON...

13:09.389 --> 13:11.491
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
THE DEPRESSION TALKING.

13:11.491 --> 13:15.495
WE WILL GET YOU
SOME MEDICATION.
 BREE. BREE.

13:15.495 --> 13:19.199
THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU
TO FEEL BADLY ABOUT THIS.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.571
I'VE HAD A GOOD LIFE.

13:21.571 --> 13:23.073
LET ME GO.

13:23.073 --> 13:25.175
I WILL DO NO SUCH THING.

13:25.175 --> 13:26.506
I FORBID THIS.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.940
DO YOU HEAR ME? YOU WILL
NOT BE KILLING YOURSELF.

13:29.940 --> 13:32.542
I WILL REMOVE EVERY KNIFE, ROPE
AND PILL FROM THIS HOUSE,

13:32.542 --> 13:35.585
AND IF I HAVE TO, I WILL BE
WITH YOU 24 HOURS A DAY.

13:35.585 --> 13:39.950
WELL, BEING BORED TO DEATH
WASN'T HOW I WAS PLANNING TO GO,

13:39.950 --> 13:43.523
BUT WE CAN TRY IT YOUR WAY.

13:46.056 --> 13:47.457
(whispers) ORSON.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.362
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME TIME
TO ADJUST TO THIS.

13:52.362 --> 13:54.534
BUT UNDERSTAND ME.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.366
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.257
(bottle thuds)

14:17.257 --> 14:18.628
WHAT'S WITH THE CONDOMS?

14:18.628 --> 14:20.630
CALM DOWN.
THEY'RE NOT FOR YOU.

14:20.630 --> 14:24.234
AH, JUST WHAT EVERY MAN WANTS
TO HEAR FROM HIS WIFE.

14:24.234 --> 14:26.536
(keys jangle)
 SO?

14:26.536 --> 14:30.500
OKAY, HEAR ME OUT. YOU KNOW
HOW ANA IS DATING DANNY BOLEN?

14:30.500 --> 14:34.274
I'M GONNA KILL HIM...
 AND WE HAVE TO
BE REALISTIC...

14:34.274 --> 14:37.407
WITH MY BARE HANDS...
 BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT
GONNA LISTEN TO REASON.

14:37.407 --> 14:40.410
AND BURY HIM UNDER THE PORCH.
 NO. CARLOS.
WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

14:40.410 --> 14:42.913
THEY'RE TWO TEENAGERS WHO ARE
GETTING SERIOUSLY INVOLVED.

14:42.913 --> 14:47.087
ISN'T IT BETTER
TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY?
 BUT GIVING THEM THESE IS LIKE
GIVING THEM OUR BLESSING.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.089
AND THAT'S HOW I FELT
AT FIRST,

14:49.089 --> 14:51.491
BUT LIKE ANGIE SAID,
NATURE'S GONNA TAKE ITS COURSE.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.194
YEAH, EASY FOR HER TO SAY.
SHE'S GOT THE BOY.

14:54.194 --> 14:57.027
WHAT IF THE CONDOM BREAKS?
WHAT IF HE FORGETS TO PUT IT ON?

14:57.027 --> 14:59.029
IF HE KNOCKS ANA UP,

14:59.029 --> 15:02.472
WHO DO YOU THINK'S
GONNA END UP RAISING THE KID?
 (sighs) GOD,
THAT WOULD BE AWFUL.

15:02.472 --> 15:04.534
GETTING UP
FOR THOSE 3:00 A.M. FEEDINGS

15:04.534 --> 15:06.676
AFTER YOU'VE WORKED ALL DAY?

15:06.676 --> 15:09.379
NOT ME. YOU.

15:09.379 --> 15:11.541
YOU'LL END UP
TAKING CARE OF THE BABY.

15:11.541 --> 15:14.514
SO YOU BETTER CONVINCE HER
TO KEEP HER LEGS CROSSED

15:14.514 --> 15:17.517
UNTIL SHE'S OUT OF THIS HOUSE.
 WAIT. HOW IS THIS MY PROBLEM?
SHE'S YOUR TRAMPY NIECE.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.020
BECAUSE IF SHE GETS PREGNANT,
I'LL BE IN PRISON

15:20.020 --> 15:23.423
FOR KILLING WHAT'S BURIED
UNDERNEATH THE PORCH.

15:25.996 --> 15:28.928
MRS. D.!

15:28.928 --> 15:30.430
(car door closes)
 ROBIN.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.402
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
ME JUST SHOWING UP,

15:32.402 --> 15:35.405
BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT
YOU SAID, AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

15:35.405 --> 15:39.369
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO CHANGE
YOUR LIFE, SO I QUIT DOUBLE D's.
 (chuckles) YOU DID?

15:39.369 --> 15:42.272
I WAS PRETTY SCARED AT FIRST,

15:42.272 --> 15:45.475
BUT NOW I THINK
IT'S THE BEST THING I EVER DID.
 WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

15:45.475 --> 15:48.418
NOW I NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD
THE GUTS WITHOUT TALKING TO YOU.

15:48.418 --> 15:52.552
YOU'RE LIKE MY ROLE MODEL.
 REALLY? (chuckles)
THAT'S SWEET.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.555
MY OLD ROLE MODEL WAS CANDI,
DOWN AT THE CLUB,

15:55.555 --> 15:57.257
BUT SHE O.D.'d.

15:57.257 --> 16:00.190
WELL, I WILL, UH,
TRY TO DO CANDI PROUD.

16:00.190 --> 16:03.293
(sighs)
GOOD FOR YOU, ROBIN.

16:03.293 --> 16:05.465
I KNOW CHANGE
TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.597
OH, IT SURE DOES.
(chuckles)

16:09.369 --> 16:11.641
SO WHAT DO I DO NOW?

16:11.641 --> 16:13.473
HUH?
 YOU KNOW...

16:13.473 --> 16:16.706
WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE?
WHERE DO I WORK NOW?

16:16.706 --> 16:18.378
I'M SORRY.

16:18.378 --> 16:21.481
Y-YOU QUIT WITHOUT HAVING
ANYTHING ELSE LINED UP?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.483
I KNOW IT WAS
A LITTLE HASTY,

16:23.483 --> 16:25.755
BUT YOU SAID I COULD DO
WHATEVER I WANTED.

16:25.755 --> 16:28.358
YOU SOUNDED SO SURE.
YOU'RE STILL SURE, RIGHT?

16:28.358 --> 16:31.691
YES, YES. I'M VERY SURE.
THE WORLD IS YOUR OYSTER.
 HUH.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.094
(chuckles)
YOU HAVE SAVED UP, RIGHT?

16:37.467 --> 16:40.770
SHE STRIPPED FOR NINE YEARS
AND DIDN'T PUT ANYTHING AWAY?

16:40.770 --> 16:43.373
APPARENTLY THERE WAS A BOOB JOB
AND A BAD RELATIONSHIP

16:43.373 --> 16:45.375
AND THE RISING COST
OF GLITTER.

16:45.375 --> 16:47.377
I HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO HELP HER.

16:47.377 --> 16:49.379
AND WHY IS THIS
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY?

16:49.379 --> 16:52.312
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE
THAT TOLD HER TO QUIT.

16:52.312 --> 16:55.315
I DIDN'T THINK SHE'D LISTEN.
NO ONE LISTENS TO ME.

16:55.315 --> 16:58.518
I KEEP TELLING YOU
HOW MUCH I HATE THAT SHIRT,

16:58.518 --> 17:02.252
AND THERE IT IS.
 OKAY, WE'LL HELP HER.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

17:02.252 --> 17:04.324
WE NEED TO FIND HER A JOB.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.326
WELL, WHAT CAN SHE DO?

17:06.326 --> 17:08.328
DOES SHE HAVE SKILLS
THAT DON'T INVOLVE

17:08.328 --> 17:12.061
PICKING UP A DOLLAR
WITHOUT USING HER HANDS?

17:15.365 --> 17:18.468
WHY ARE YOU SO SAD?

17:18.468 --> 17:20.640
WELL, M.J.,

17:20.640 --> 17:23.643
I NEED A JOB,
AND I DON'T HAVE ANY SKILLS.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.474
YOU'RE SO PRETTY.

17:25.474 --> 17:27.317
YOU COULD BE A PRINCESS.

17:27.317 --> 17:29.349
OH.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.751
OH, LOOK.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.324
M.J. IS SO SMITTEN
WITH HER.

17:34.324 --> 17:36.055
HE'S A GUY.

17:37.527 --> 17:40.430
AND SHE'S GOOD WITH KIDS.

17:41.791 --> 17:43.833
(gasps) THAT'S IT.

17:43.833 --> 17:46.496
THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR AN ASSISTANT ART TEACHER

17:46.496 --> 17:48.198
DOWN AT THE SCHOOL.

17:48.198 --> 17:51.201
SHE SAID SHE ALWAYS WANTED
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

17:51.201 --> 17:54.204
WELL, YOU THINK
SHE CAN HANDLE IT?
 WE GLUE MACARONI TO SHOEBOXES.

17:54.204 --> 17:56.406
IT'S NOT THE HARDEST JOB
IN THE WORLD.

17:56.406 --> 17:59.709
NOW SEE, HOW COME WHEN I SAY
THAT, YOU GIVE ME THAT LOOK?

18:01.411 --> 18:04.214
AND THERE IT IS AGAIN.

18:04.214 --> 18:06.286
THANKS FOR CHEERING ME UP,
M.J.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.587
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

18:07.587 --> 18:11.361
YOU CAN GIVE ME A BATH
IF YOU WANT TO.

18:21.171 --> 18:23.102
ROY!
 AAH!

18:23.102 --> 18:25.375
JEEZ, YOU SCARED
THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.737
WHERE'S ORSON? YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE WATCHING HIM.

18:27.737 --> 18:30.280
DON'T WORRY. I STUCK HIM
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM

18:30.280 --> 18:32.512
AND PUT A BROOM
THROUGH HIS SPOKES.

18:34.314 --> 18:37.116
(huffs)

18:37.116 --> 18:38.648
HELLO, BREE.

18:38.648 --> 18:44.354
CAN WE PLEASE CROSS ROY OFF
THE SUICIDE WATCH LIST?

18:44.354 --> 18:47.427
HEY. YOU'RE ALIVE.
MY JOB'S DONE HERE.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.159
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

18:49.159 --> 18:51.161
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BACK
AN HOUR AGO.

18:51.161 --> 18:55.235
I AM SORRY, BUT I HAD TO STOP
AND PICK UP OUR GUESTS.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.736
WHAT GUESTS?

18:56.736 --> 18:59.409
(door creaks)

18:59.409 --> 19:02.412
ORSON, MEET CHRIS AND RON.

19:02.412 --> 19:05.415
NOW I KNOW YOU WON'T LISTEN
TO ME, BUT YOU MIGHT LISTEN

19:05.415 --> 19:08.418
TO THEM, SINCE YOU HAVE
SOMETHING IN COMMON.
 REALLY?

19:08.418 --> 19:11.221
ARE YOU GILBERT AND SULLIVAN
FANS, TOO?

19:11.221 --> 19:14.354
(laughs) SENSE OF HUMOR.
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.357
NOW I KNOW YOU THINK THERE'S
NO REASON TO GO ON LIVING,

19:17.357 --> 19:19.359
BECAUSE YOU'RE PARALYZED--
 SO YOU THOUGHT, "HEY!"

19:19.359 --> 19:22.362
(snaps fingers)
 "YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT CHEER HIM
UP? TWO MORE PARALYZED GUYS."

19:22.362 --> 19:24.364
PLEASE. JUST HEAR THEM OUT.

19:24.364 --> 19:28.668
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GOING TO MAKE SOME TEA.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.941
SO YOUR WIFE TELLS US
YOU IN A PRETTY NEGATIVE PLACE.

19:31.941 --> 19:34.944
WELL, THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED,
BUT EVENTUALLY--
 LOOK, I KNOW YOU MEAN WELL,

19:34.944 --> 19:37.377
BUT I DON'T NEED
A HANDICAPPED PEP TALK.

19:37.377 --> 19:40.550
HEY, WE'RE NOT HANDICAPPED.
WE'RE HANDI-CAPABLE.

19:40.550 --> 19:42.952
OH, LORD.

19:42.952 --> 19:45.685
WE PLAY BASKETBALL, DANCE,
WE MAKE LOVE.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.717
AND I HOPE
YOU'RE VERY HAPPY TOGETHER.

19:47.717 --> 19:49.689
I, UNFORTUNATELY,
DON'T HAVE

19:49.689 --> 19:53.723
SOMEONE TO JOIN ME
ON THIS JOURNEY.
 YOU HAVE A WIFE
WHO CLEARLY LOVES YOU.

19:53.723 --> 19:55.425
WOW. PARALYZED AND BLIND.

19:55.425 --> 19:58.428
YOU MUST ALWAYS BE THE FIRST ONE
TO BOARD THE PLANE.

19:58.428 --> 20:02.332
(chuckles) LOOK, WE KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

20:02.332 --> 20:05.335
A LOT OF US FEEL UNLOVED AFTER
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS.

20:05.335 --> 20:06.836
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:06.836 --> 20:10.810
MY WIFE STAYS WITH ME
 SOLELY OUT OF OBLIGATION.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.843
ORSON! HOW COULD YOU SAY
SUCH A THING?

20:13.843 --> 20:17.587
IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?
YOU FEEL GUILTY BECAUSE YOU KNOW

20:17.587 --> 20:20.290
I NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN HIT
BY THAT PLANE

20:20.290 --> 20:24.424
IF I HADN'T GOTTEN IN
A FISTFIGHT WITH YOUR LOVER.
 THIS IS THE THANKS I GET?
I HAVE BENT OVER BACKWARDS

20:24.424 --> 20:26.426
TO MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.798
I SHOULD JUST LET YOU
HANG YOURSELF.

20:28.798 --> 20:31.831
HEY... DON'T WE HAVE
A BASKETBALL GAME AT 2:00?

20:31.831 --> 20:33.833
CAN YOU BE HONEST
FOR ONE MOMENT?

20:33.833 --> 20:37.236
YOU DON'T LOVE ME.
 YEAH, WE SHOULD GO.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.608
PLEASE STAY. I'VE MADE TEA.

20:38.608 --> 20:41.341
SEE? YOU CAN'T DENY IT.

20:41.341 --> 20:44.844
GO AHEAD, BREE. CORRECT ME.
SAY YOU LOVE ME.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.477
I...

20:53.583 --> 20:56.356
CARE VERY DEEPLY FOR YOU.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.388
(inhales sharply)

20:58.388 --> 21:00.760
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

21:05.695 --> 21:08.398
I'M FEELING A LITTLE UPSET
RIGHT NOW.

21:08.398 --> 21:10.670
WOULD YOU MIND
ROLLING YOURSELVES OUT?

21:21.711 --> 21:23.713
ANA,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

21:23.713 --> 21:25.415
ARE YOU HAPPY?

21:25.415 --> 21:26.456
WHY?

21:26.456 --> 21:29.319
WELL, CARLOS AND I WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

21:29.319 --> 21:31.321
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS,

21:31.321 --> 21:34.324
WE'VE COME TO THINK OF YOU
AS OUR OWN DAUGHTER.
 REALLY?

21:34.324 --> 21:35.865
IN FACT, YOUR UNCLE

21:35.865 --> 21:39.028
THINKS IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU AND I
HAD THAT LITTLE TALK...

21:39.028 --> 21:41.030
ABOUT THE BIRDS
AND THE BEES.

21:41.030 --> 21:44.834
OH, GOD.
 THAT'S HOW I FEEL, SO WE'RE
NOT GONNA BE DOING THAT.

21:44.834 --> 21:46.976
OKAY.

21:46.976 --> 21:50.340
INSTEAD I'M GOING
TO WRITE YOU A CHECK.
 A-A CHECK?

21:50.340 --> 21:53.943
A CHECK BIG ENOUGH TO COVER ONE
WHOLE YEAR OF MODELING SCHOOL...

21:53.943 --> 21:56.386
AND TO RENT
A DECENT-SIZE APARTMENT...
 (check rips)

21:56.386 --> 21:58.418
IN NEW YORK.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.919
OKAY, WHAT'S THE CATCH?

21:59.919 --> 22:02.922
(laughs) THAT'S SO CUTE THAT
YOU THINK THERE'S A CATCH.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.855
THIS ISN'T SIGNED.
 THAT'S THE CATCH.

22:05.855 --> 22:08.958
I WILL SIGN IT
ONCE YOU GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL

22:08.958 --> 22:11.801
WITHOUT HAVING HAD SEX
OR MORE SEX, AS THE CASE MAY BE.

22:11.801 --> 22:13.933
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

22:13.933 --> 22:16.636
(sighs) ANA, I COULD TALK
TO YOU ABOUT MORALITY

22:16.636 --> 22:18.638
OR SAVING YOURSELF
FOR MARRIAGE

22:18.638 --> 22:21.411
OR STATISTICS ABOUT S.T.D.s,

22:21.411 --> 22:23.813
BUT I THINK
YOU'RE THE KIND OF GIRL

22:23.813 --> 22:26.115
WHO RESPONDS
TO COLD, HARD CASH.

22:26.115 --> 22:28.948
YOU KNOW ME WELL.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.381
SO DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

22:31.381 --> 22:34.023
ARE YOU GONNA BE A SUCCESSFUL
MODEL WITH A NICE APARTMENT

22:34.023 --> 22:36.486
OR A TEENAGE MOM
WITH NO FUTURE?

22:36.486 --> 22:38.888
WELL...

22:38.888 --> 22:41.561
WHEN YOU PUT IT
LIKE THAT...

22:41.561 --> 22:43.563
GOOD GIRL.

22:43.563 --> 22:47.136
OH, AND TO ANSWER
YOUR EARLIER QUESTION,

22:47.136 --> 22:50.540
I'M NOW VERY HAPPY.

22:52.602 --> 22:55.975
(lowered voice) I CAN'T BELIEVE
I LET YOU TALK ME INTO THIS.

22:55.975 --> 22:58.107
THREE HOURS OF SHAKESPEARE

22:58.107 --> 23:01.951
FOR A WOMAN WHO HAS
TO PEE EVERY 20 MINUTES.
 (lowered voice) COME ON.

23:01.951 --> 23:04.013
DR. GRAHAM'S BEEN
SO SUPPORTIVE OF US.

23:04.013 --> 23:06.816
CAN'T WE BE SUPPORTIVE
OF HER?
 THIS ISN'T ABOUT SUPPORT.

23:06.816 --> 23:10.560
THIS IS ABOUT
LITTLE TOMMY TEACHER'S PET

23:10.560 --> 23:13.623
WANTING A GOLD STAR
FOR BUTT-KISSING.
 OH.

23:13.623 --> 23:15.124
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

23:15.124 --> 23:18.628
(fanfare plays)
 AH.

23:18.628 --> 23:21.400
NAY, BUT THIS DOTAGE...

23:21.400 --> 23:23.402
(whispering) PLEASE.

23:23.402 --> 23:27.136
YOU BROUGHT HER
A $40 BOX OF CHOCOLATES.

23:27.136 --> 23:29.138
LAST MOTHER'S DAY,
YOU THREW ME A BAGEL

23:29.138 --> 23:31.140
AND CALLED IT
BREAKFAST IN BED.

23:31.140 --> 23:34.143
(whispering) ADMIT IT.
YOU JUST HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HER

23:34.143 --> 23:37.016
BECAUSE YOU HATE IT WHEN SOMEONE
POINTS OUT YOUR FLAWS.
 (gasps)

23:37.016 --> 23:38.718
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

23:38.718 --> 23:41.020
I CAN TAKE CONSTRUCTIVE
CRITICISM JUST FINE.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.653
(whispers) YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE LOUD.

23:43.653 --> 23:45.054
SORRY.

23:45.054 --> 23:47.897
SEE? I CAN TAKE
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.

23:47.897 --> 23:51.130
YOU'RE STILL TALKING.
 YOU'RE STILL ANNOYING.
RELAX.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.132
SHH.
SHE'S MAKING HER ENTRANCE.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.664
OH.
 (man) ...FROM ROME.

23:54.664 --> 23:58.968
GRATES ME--THE SUM.

23:58.968 --> 24:02.041
NAY! HEAR THEM, ANTONY!

24:05.615 --> 24:08.047
FLUVIA PERCHANCE IS ANGRY.

24:08.047 --> 24:12.221
OR... WHO KNOWS?

24:12.221 --> 24:14.524
IF THE BEARD...

24:16.586 --> 24:18.728
IF THE SCARCE-BEARDED CAESAR

24:18.728 --> 24:22.131
HATH NOT SENT YOU
HIS POWERFUL MANDATE--

24:22.131 --> 24:25.535
"DO THIS OR THIS.

24:25.535 --> 24:28.698
"TAKE IN THAT KINGDOM
AND ENFRANCHISE THAT.

24:28.698 --> 24:30.099
PERFORM'T"...

24:30.099 --> 24:32.171
(deepens voice)
"OR ELSE WE DAMN THEE."

24:32.171 --> 24:33.903
(thud)

24:39.248 --> 24:41.581
(Lynette speaks indistinctly)

24:41.581 --> 24:43.813
HEY. HOW WAS THE PLAY?
 HEY.

24:43.813 --> 24:47.016
LINCOLN HAD A BETTER TIME
AT THE THEATER.

24:47.016 --> 24:48.157
REALLY?

24:48.157 --> 24:50.259
SO HOW BAD WAS IT?

24:50.259 --> 24:53.262
YOU REMEMBER HOW HORRIBLE YOUR
SECOND GRADE ARBOR DAY PLAY WAS?

24:53.262 --> 24:56.966
BUT AT LEAST WE WERE DRUNK
FOR THAT.
 MM. (chuckles)

24:56.966 --> 24:59.529
(Tom) HONESTLY, HOW DID
DR. GRAHAM GET THAT PART?

24:59.529 --> 25:01.631
IS SHE SLEEPING
WITH THE DIRECTOR?

25:01.631 --> 25:03.933
SLEEPING WITH, BATHING,
DONATING A KIDNEY--

25:03.933 --> 25:06.035
IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH.

25:06.035 --> 25:09.038
I JUST HOPE THAT I CAN ERASE
THIS FROM MY MEMORY

25:09.038 --> 25:11.210
BEFORE OUR NEXT SESSION.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.913
ARE YOU KIDDING?
WE'RE NOT SEEING HER AGAIN.
 (bottle fizzes)

25:13.913 --> 25:17.286
WHY NOT?
 WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE
TO TAKE LIFE LESSONS

25:17.286 --> 25:21.150
FROM A WOMAN WHO BURPED
 DURING HER DEATH SCENE.

25:21.150 --> 25:25.024
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH HER SKILLS AS A THERAPIST.

25:25.024 --> 25:29.158
REALLY? DID SHE NOT TELL YOU
SHE HAS A "GIFT" FOR ACTING?

25:29.158 --> 25:31.661
YEAH.
 WELL, I CAN'T TRUST
THE JUDGMENT

25:31.661 --> 25:34.063
OF SOMEONE WITH
ABSOLUTELY NO SELF-AWARENESS.

25:34.063 --> 25:35.565
WE'RE NOT GOING BACK.

25:35.565 --> 25:37.567
THIS IS AN EXCUSE.
YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING

25:37.567 --> 25:40.539
FOR A REASON TO DUMP HER
EVER SINCE OUR LAST SESSION.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.211
TOM, I LEARNED
TWO THINGS TONIGHT--

25:42.211 --> 25:45.575
DR. GRAHAM HAS NO INSIGHT
INTO REAL HUMAN BEHAVIOR,

25:45.575 --> 25:50.019
AND THERE ARE 428 TILES
ON THE CEILING OF THAT THEATER.

25:50.019 --> 25:53.883
SAY WHAT YOU WANT. WE ARE
GOING TO OUR NEXT SESSION.

25:53.883 --> 25:55.024
MNH-MNH.

25:55.024 --> 25:57.026
MM-HMM. AND, BY THE WAY,

25:57.026 --> 26:00.059
IT WAS 429.

26:13.002 --> 26:14.243
MORNING.

26:14.243 --> 26:16.045
(children speaking indistinctly)

26:16.045 --> 26:17.807
ROBIN GALLAGHER,
TEACHING ASSISTANT,

26:17.807 --> 26:19.779
REPORTING FOR DUTY.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.712
HEY, LOOK AT YOU.
 I WANTED TO LOOK PROFESSIONAL.

26:22.712 --> 26:25.314
DO YOU LIKE THE GLASSES?
I DON'T EVEN NEED THEM.

26:25.314 --> 26:29.118
(chuckles) YOU LOOK GREAT.
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL SUIT.

26:29.118 --> 26:31.260
THANKS. IT IS SO NICE
TO WEAR WORK CLOTHES

26:31.260 --> 26:33.723
THAT DON'T RIP AWAY
TO REVEAL CROTCHLESS PANTIES.

26:33.723 --> 26:36.295
YEAH, YOU'RE PREACHING
TO THE CHOIR. (chuckles)

26:36.295 --> 26:39.298
SO, UM, I'M JUST GONNA GET
THE KIDS STARTED PAINTING.

26:39.298 --> 26:42.101
AND WHY DON'T YOU HANG THOSE
GLOBES THAT WE MADE LAST WEEK?

26:42.101 --> 26:43.973
OKAY. (laughs)

26:43.973 --> 26:46.806
(clears throat)

26:46.806 --> 26:51.110
UM, CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

26:51.110 --> 26:53.643
YOU REALLY
TOOK A CHANCE ON ME.

26:53.643 --> 26:56.085
(voice breaks) NO ONE'S EVER
DONE THAT FOR ME BEFORE,

26:56.085 --> 26:58.017
SO THANK YOU.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.049
YOU'RE WELCOME.
 (chuckles)

27:00.049 --> 27:03.152
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
 (cries)

27:03.152 --> 27:04.854
OH, HEY, CAREFUL.

27:04.854 --> 27:06.856
NEVER LET THE KIDS
SEE YOU CRY.

27:06.856 --> 27:09.098
IF THEY SENSE WEAKNESS,
YOU'RE DONE.

27:09.098 --> 27:11.130
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.663
FORGOT HIS BACKPACK.
 OH, THAT'S OKAY, MR. LINWOOD.

27:13.663 --> 27:15.765
COME ON, KYLE.
LET'S GET YOU PAINTING.

27:18.067 --> 27:20.109
WHO'S THAT?

27:20.109 --> 27:23.042
AH, THAT'S MY NEW TEACHING
ASSISTANT, MISS GALLAGHER.

27:23.042 --> 27:27.817
NO, BOBBY. THAT'S NOT
HOW WE USE PIPE CLEANERS!

27:27.817 --> 27:30.019
I'M SORRY.

27:30.019 --> 27:32.281
DO WE KNOW EACH OTHER?

27:32.281 --> 27:34.283
OH. I DON'T THINK SO.

27:34.283 --> 27:37.126
ARE YOU SURE?
YOU LOOK SO FAMILIAR.

27:37.126 --> 27:40.159
I GUESS I JUST HAVE
ONE OF THOSE FACES. (chuckles)

27:46.165 --> 27:49.138
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME
ABOUT, PRINCIPAL HOBSON?

27:49.138 --> 27:51.340
YOU ARE AWARE, AREN'T YOU,

27:51.340 --> 27:53.342
THAT AS A PRIVATE SCHOOL,

27:53.342 --> 27:55.344
WE DEPEND
ON THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT

27:55.344 --> 27:58.307
OF OUR MORE AFFLUENT
PARENT DONORS?

27:58.307 --> 28:00.149
I AM AWARE OF THAT.

28:00.149 --> 28:02.681
GOOD.

28:02.681 --> 28:06.055
BECAUSE I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM KYLE LINWOOD'S FATHER,

28:06.055 --> 28:07.857
A MAJOR DONOR.

28:09.889 --> 28:12.892
IS IT TRUE THAT
YOUR ASSISTANT CAN BREAK A $5

28:12.892 --> 28:14.964
BY SHAKING OUT HER UNDERWEAR?

28:23.202 --> 28:26.205
I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE A BATH!
 WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

28:26.205 --> 28:29.208
IT'S TIME TO GIVE THE EARTH
BACK SOME OF ITS DIRT.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.040
GO!

28:31.040 --> 28:33.042
HEY, I'M GONNA BE UPSTAIRS
FOR A BIT.

28:33.042 --> 28:35.214
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
UP TO TONIGHT?

28:35.214 --> 28:38.948
WE'RE JUST GONNA STAY HOME
AND STUDY.
 (singsong voice) GOOD GIRL.

28:46.495 --> 28:49.999
MM! WHY ARE YOU GETTING ME
ALL WORKED UP?

28:49.999 --> 28:53.032
I THOUGHT YOU MADE YOUR AUNT
A PROMISE.

28:53.032 --> 28:55.034
I PROMISED HER
I WOULDN'T HAVE SEX.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.306
I DIDN'T PROMISE
YOU WOULDN'T.

29:03.012 --> 29:06.846
(crickets chirping)

29:12.351 --> 29:16.125
FINE! I'LL SORT IT MYSELF!

29:37.907 --> 29:39.508
(keys jangle)

29:41.380 --> 29:44.083
(click)

29:44.083 --> 29:46.956
MR. SOLIS.

29:46.956 --> 29:49.088
OKAY,
DON'T FREAK OUT, OKAY?

29:49.088 --> 29:52.191
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
 HEY, I'M--I'M SORRY.
THIS--THIS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

29:52.191 --> 29:56.065
UNCLE CARLOS,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
 YOU THINK YOU CAN COME
INTO MY HOUSE AND DO THIS?!

29:56.065 --> 29:59.268
(Carlos) ANSWER ME!

29:59.268 --> 30:00.429
HUH?!

30:00.429 --> 30:02.371
ANSWER ME! ANSWER ME!

30:02.371 --> 30:04.333
(shouting indistinctly)

30:04.333 --> 30:07.576
(door opens)
 I CATCH YOU NEAR HER AGAIN,
I WILL KICK YOUR ASS, BOY.

30:07.576 --> 30:12.081
LET GO OF HIM!
 YOU KNOW WHAT I CAUGHT YOUR SON
DOING IN MY HOUSE?

30:12.081 --> 30:14.013
I DON'T CARE.
 CARLOS, WHAT IS GOING ON?!

30:14.013 --> 30:16.385
I SAID LET GO!

30:16.385 --> 30:19.048
OH, GOD!
ANGIE, WHAT THE HELL?!

30:20.549 --> 30:23.893
WAIT FOR ME OUTSIDE.
 MA, PLEASE DON'T.

30:23.893 --> 30:25.554
OUTSIDE!

30:33.062 --> 30:36.405
(door opens)
 (panting) LOOK, I CAME IN
AND FOUND HIM ON TOP OF HER.

30:36.405 --> 30:38.407
I DON'T CARE. HE'S MY KID.

30:38.407 --> 30:42.111
YOU EVER TOUCH HIM AGAIN,
YOU'RE DEAD.

30:49.078 --> 30:50.349
HEY, BOLEN!

30:50.349 --> 30:54.183
I SEE YOU TRIED TO SEPARATE
MY GLASS AND PLASTIC.

30:54.183 --> 30:58.487
(dogs barking in distance,
bottles clatter)

30:58.487 --> 31:00.459
SUCK IT, EARTH!

31:00.459 --> 31:02.431
MA!

31:08.998 --> 31:10.299
(loud clatter)

31:10.299 --> 31:13.072
COME ON, MA. LET'S GO.

31:25.454 --> 31:27.456
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
JUST THINK

31:27.456 --> 31:29.458
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY

31:29.458 --> 31:32.491
BUT ABOUT HOW YOU SAY IT,
SO TOM CAN HEAR YOU.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.897
THAT'S...

31:38.897 --> 31:41.000
A THEORY.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.932
IS SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU,
LYNETTE?

31:42.932 --> 31:45.274
IT'S THE PREGNANCY.
(chuckles nervously)

31:45.274 --> 31:47.276
THIS MORNING
SHE GOT MAD AT ME

31:47.276 --> 31:49.908
OVER THE WAY I DRANK
MY ORANGE JUICE.

31:49.908 --> 31:53.142
IS THAT ALL? YOU KNOW
YOU'RE IN A SAFE PLACE HERE.

31:53.142 --> 31:57.016
WE CAN TELL EACH OTHER
ANYTHING.

31:59.488 --> 32:01.420
OKAY.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.922
SINCE THIS IS A SAFE PLACE...

32:06.095 --> 32:08.697
TOM AND I SAW YOUR PLAY
THE OTHER NIGHT.

32:08.697 --> 32:13.032
YOU DID? WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
COME BACKSTAGE AND SAY HELLO?

32:13.032 --> 32:16.635
WELL, THE TRUTH IS, I DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT TO SAY, BECAUSE...

32:16.635 --> 32:18.707
I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT.

32:20.539 --> 32:23.142
I KNOW.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.074
OUR ANTONY WAS DREADFUL.

32:25.074 --> 32:27.576
YOU WEREN'T THE ONLY ONE
WHO THOUGHT SO.

32:27.576 --> 32:30.049
NO... ACTUALLY,
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.982
YOU WERE...

32:32.982 --> 32:34.423
REALLY NOT VERY GOOD,

32:34.423 --> 32:36.425
AND NOW I'VE SORT OF
LOST CONFIDENCE

32:36.425 --> 32:39.658
IN YOU AS A THERAPIST.

32:39.658 --> 32:42.031
OH.

32:42.031 --> 32:43.592
OKAY.

32:43.592 --> 32:45.594
DO YOU WANT TO ELABORATE?

32:45.594 --> 32:48.437
NO. I THINK I SAID
WHAT I NEEDED TO SAY.

32:50.099 --> 32:51.740
AHA.

32:51.740 --> 32:54.243
SEE, THIS IS THE SAME THING
IN YOUR MARRIAGE.

32:54.243 --> 32:56.745
YOU CRITICIZE TOM,
BUT YOU WON'T BE SPECIFIC.

32:56.745 --> 32:59.578
IT'S SORT OF
THE COWARD'S WAY OUT.

32:59.578 --> 33:03.012
COWARD?

33:05.114 --> 33:06.755
OKAY.

33:06.755 --> 33:08.187
YOU SUCKED.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.519
YOU WERE REALLY, REALLY BAD.

33:10.519 --> 33:12.361
THREE WORDS--

33:12.361 --> 33:14.723
STINK, STANK, STUNK.

33:14.723 --> 33:17.026
SPECIFIC ENOUGH?

33:19.198 --> 33:22.131
GOOD FOR YOU, LYNETTE.

33:22.131 --> 33:24.333
I COMMEND YOU
FOR YOUR HONESTY.

33:26.405 --> 33:30.579
ALTHOUGH, THE "FAIRVIEW HERALD"
HAD A DIFFERENT TAKE.

33:30.579 --> 33:33.712
THEY FOUND MY CLEOPATRA
"INCANDESCENT."

33:33.712 --> 33:35.414
OH... MY GOD.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.646
YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT?

33:37.646 --> 33:40.419
SEE, THIS IS WHY
WE CAN'T SEE HER ANYMORE.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.651
TOM, YOU HAVEN'T
WEIGHED IN YET.

33:42.651 --> 33:44.723
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

33:50.799 --> 33:54.032
(high-pitched voice)
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GREAT.

33:54.032 --> 33:57.406
WHAT? LIAR! YOU SAID
YOU'VE SEEN SEALS PLAYING HORNS

33:57.406 --> 34:01.510
THAT PUT ON A BETTER SHOW.
 THERE'S NO NEED TO BULLY HIM
INTO AGREEING WITH YOU.

34:01.510 --> 34:04.573
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO BULLY HIM
IF HE WOULD MAN UP FOR ONCE.

34:04.573 --> 34:07.576
LYNETTE, YOU'RE ATTACKING.
 OF COURSE.
BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS THE BAD COP,

34:07.576 --> 34:09.578
HE'S ALWAYS THE GOOD COP.

34:09.578 --> 34:11.620
COULD YOU JUST ONCE
NOT BE SUCH A WUSS?

34:11.620 --> 34:14.322
DAMN RIGHT I'M THE GOOD COP.
SOMEONE HAS TO BE,

34:14.322 --> 34:16.525
BECAUSE BAD COP-BAD COP
DOESN'T WORK.

34:16.525 --> 34:19.728
I GREW UP IN THAT HOUSE,
AND IT DOESN'T WORK.

34:19.728 --> 34:23.262
THAT IS NOT IT.
YOU LIKE ME BEING THE BAD GUY.

34:23.262 --> 34:26.735
THAT WAY YOU CAN ALWAYS BE
THE GOOD GUY. BUT GUESS WHAT?

34:26.735 --> 34:30.099
I'D LOVE TO BE THE GOOD GUY
ONCE IN A WHILE, BUT I CAN'T,

34:30.099 --> 34:32.101
BECAUSE WHEN THINGS GET HARD

34:32.101 --> 34:34.273
OR A DIFFICULT DECISION
HAS TO GET MADE,

34:34.273 --> 34:35.774
YOU RUN FROM CONFRONTATION,

34:35.774 --> 34:37.775
AND IF I DON'T STEP
INTO THE VOID,

34:37.775 --> 34:40.779
THINGS GRIND TO A HALT.
BECAUSE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU--

34:40.779 --> 34:44.783
GOOD COP-GOOD COP
DOESN'T WORK EITHER!

34:49.788 --> 34:51.360
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:53.762 --> 34:55.194
REALLY?

34:55.194 --> 34:57.696
I LIKE TO BE LIKED,

34:57.696 --> 34:59.568
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,

34:59.568 --> 35:03.602
A LOT OF THE UGLY STUFF
I DEFER TO YOU.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.204
AND I'M SORRY.

35:09.578 --> 35:12.311
YOUR PERFORMANCE WAS
AGGRESSIVELY BAD.

35:12.311 --> 35:15.184
AT ONE POINT DURING
THE SECOND ACT, I STARTED

35:15.184 --> 35:18.787
TO CHOKE ON A MINT AND THOUGHT
ABOUT NOT FIGHTING IT.

35:20.789 --> 35:22.691
THANK YOU.

35:24.523 --> 35:27.756
WOW. THIS WAS
QUITE A BREAKTHROUGH.

35:27.756 --> 35:30.159
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

35:30.159 --> 35:33.632
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL THERAPIST.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.864
THANK YOU, LYNETTE.

35:35.864 --> 35:39.768
NOW, BOTH OF YOU, GET THE HELL
OUT OF MY OFFICE.

35:42.171 --> 35:44.673
SO WE CATCH HER SON
ON TOP OF OUR NIECE,

35:44.673 --> 35:47.616
AND WE HAVE TO APOLOGIZE?
 NO, WE HAVE TO APOLOGIZE

35:47.616 --> 35:50.619
BECAUSE YOU ALMOST PUT
HER SON'S HEAD THROUGH A WALL.

35:50.619 --> 35:53.622
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA LEARN
VIOLENCE IS NOT THE ANSWER?

35:53.622 --> 35:55.184
(sighs)

35:57.386 --> 36:00.629
(Nick) I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
TELL YOU THIS! YOU KNOW BETTER!

36:00.629 --> 36:03.362
WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR 19
YEARS. YOU'RE SMARTER THAN THIS!

36:03.362 --> 36:06.365
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.667
I FEEL LIKE I'M TALKING
TO A WALL HERE, HUH?

36:08.667 --> 36:10.699
(whispers)
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

36:10.699 --> 36:12.641
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH YOU?!

36:12.641 --> 36:15.304
(lowered voice) OH, GOD.
HE'S RIPPING DANNY A NEW ONE.

36:15.304 --> 36:19.408
(Nick) DAMN IT! ANGIE!
 OKAY, NICK,
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!

36:19.408 --> 36:21.650
NO, NO, NO, NO. HEY!
YOU ARE GETTING SLOPPY.

36:21.650 --> 36:23.812
WE SHOULD GO.
 YEAH, WE SHOULD.

36:23.812 --> 36:25.814
(Nick) FIRST YOU GET INTO IT
WITH THAT CRAZY LADY

36:25.814 --> 36:28.957
ABOUT HER RECYCLING,
 WHICH I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO.

36:28.957 --> 36:31.720
AND THEN GUESS WHAT?
SHE COMES OVER THIS MORNING

36:31.720 --> 36:34.723
AND SAYS SHE'S THINKING
ABOUT SUING US.
 OKAY, I LOST MY COOL.

36:34.723 --> 36:37.726
WELL, GET IT BACK! 'CAUSE
THIS ROCK WE ARE HIDING UNDER

36:37.726 --> 36:41.900
IS NOT THAT BIG, AND IF PEOPLE
START POKING AROUND, WE'RE DONE.

36:52.411 --> 36:52.741
AND THEN BAM.

36:52.741 --> 36:54.983
HE FIRES HER FOR SOMETHING
SHE USED TO DO.

36:54.983 --> 36:56.985
IT'S SO HYPOCRITICAL.

36:56.985 --> 36:59.988
I MEAN, WHY NOT GET MAD
AT THE KID'S FATHER?

36:59.988 --> 37:01.990
HE OBVIOUSLY GOES
 TO DOUBLE D's.

37:01.990 --> 37:05.424
(sighs) I JUST HOPE I DIDN'T GET
YOU INTO ANY TROUBLE, MRS. D.

37:05.424 --> 37:06.725
I FEEL AWFUL.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.558
NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

37:09.558 --> 37:12.561
WHEN I'M SAD,
MY MOM GIVES ME A BIG HUG.

37:12.561 --> 37:14.533
DOWN, TIGER.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.865
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
I HAVE NO MONEY FOR RENT.

37:16.865 --> 37:18.867
I'M JUST GONNA END UP
HOMELESS.

37:18.867 --> 37:22.411
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD GO
AND BEG FOR MY OLD JOB BACK.

37:22.411 --> 37:24.413
NO, NO, NO.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

37:24.413 --> 37:26.775
QUITTING THAT PLACE
TOOK A LOT OF GUTS.

37:30.319 --> 37:33.322
(lowers voice) HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT LETTING HER MOVE IN HERE?

37:33.322 --> 37:35.253
JULIE'S GONE.
WE HAVE HER EMPTY ROOM.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.587
IT'S JUST
UNTIL SHE GETS ON HER FEET.
 (lowers voice)
YOU'RE ASKING IF I'M OKAY

37:38.587 --> 37:40.589
WITH LETTING A STRIPPER
LIVE WITH US?

37:40.589 --> 37:42.631
I'M GONNA GO WITH NO.
 WHY NOT?

37:42.631 --> 37:46.765
I HAVE NO IDEA. I'M JUST REALLY
SURE THIS IS A TRICK QUESTION.
 SHE'S A NICE GIRL,
AND SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.767
YOU KNOW, I THINK OF MYSELF

37:48.767 --> 37:50.669
AS A GOOD PERSON
WHO CARES ABOUT OTHERS,

37:50.669 --> 37:53.672
AND HOW OFTEN DO I ACTUALLY
GET TO WALK THE WALK?

37:53.672 --> 37:56.845
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO REALLY HELP SOMEONE.

37:56.845 --> 37:58.977
I WANT TO DO IT.

38:01.950 --> 38:03.812
OKAY.

38:03.812 --> 38:05.814
OKAY, LET'S GO MAKE
AN EX-STRIPPER

38:05.814 --> 38:07.856
AND A LITTLE BOY VERY HAPPY.

38:12.921 --> 38:14.663
WHAT'S THIS FOR?

38:14.663 --> 38:16.665
THE LACKEYS'
50th ANNIVERSARY PARTY.

38:16.665 --> 38:18.367
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

38:18.367 --> 38:20.629
I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT
I'D BE DEAD BY NOW,

38:20.629 --> 38:22.631
SO I WASN'T PAYING
MUCH ATTENTION

38:22.631 --> 38:24.333
TO OUR SOCIAL CALENDAR.

38:24.333 --> 38:26.335
WELL, REGARDLESS,
YOU'RE GOING.

38:26.335 --> 38:28.607
AND IF YOU'RE STILL AROUND
NEXT SATURDAY,

38:28.607 --> 38:30.839
WE'VE GOT BRUNCH
WITH MY FAMILY.

38:30.839 --> 38:33.482
WELL,
NOW YOU'RE JUST DARING ME.

38:38.647 --> 38:43.021
ORSON, WALTER IS ABOUT
TO MAKE A TOAST.

38:43.021 --> 38:44.593
DON'T YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?

38:44.593 --> 38:48.527
A SPEECH ABOUT THE JOYS
OF WEDDED BLISS?

38:48.527 --> 38:49.958
PASS.

38:56.865 --> 38:59.868
(man, amplified voice) WALTER
AND SHIRLEY ARE ABOUT TO DANCE

38:59.868 --> 39:02.641
TO A SONG THAT WAS PLAYED
AT THEIR WEDDING.

39:02.641 --> 39:05.614
BUT BEFORE THEY DO, WALTER WOULD
LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

39:05.614 --> 39:08.517
(amplified voice) I WANT
TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

39:08.517 --> 39:11.680
50 YEARS... (chuckles)
IT HARDLY SEEMS POSSIBLE.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.822
AND NOW I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU

39:13.822 --> 39:15.824
AND SAY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN EASY.

39:15.824 --> 39:18.356
I MEAN, WE'VE HAD
OUR SHARE OF TRAGEDY

39:18.356 --> 39:22.461
AND WE'VE SAID A FEW THINGS
WE WISH WE COULD TAKE BACK.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.893
BUT FOR THE MOST PART,
WE'VE BEEN LUCKY,

39:24.893 --> 39:27.596
BECAUSE NO MATTER
HOW OLD WE GET,

39:27.596 --> 39:29.598
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE
TO REMEMBER

39:29.598 --> 39:33.642
WHAT MADE US FALL IN LOVE
IN THE FIRST PLACE, RIGHT, HON?

39:33.642 --> 39:34.943
(kiss)
 (guests) AW.

39:34.943 --> 39:37.676
(laughter and applause)

ORSON! STOP!

40:16.445 --> 40:19.117
DON'T YOU DARE THROW YOURSELF
IN THAT POOL!

40:19.117 --> 40:20.519
(pants)

40:20.519 --> 40:23.752
I WANT TO DIE.
WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME?

40:23.752 --> 40:25.754
BECAUSE I WANT THINGS, TOO.

40:25.754 --> 40:28.727
I WANT A PARTY LIKE THIS SOMEDAY
TO CELEBRATE OUR LIFE TOGETHER.

40:28.727 --> 40:31.700
WHAT IS THERE ABOUT OUR LIFE
TO CELEBRATE?

40:31.700 --> 40:34.132
LOOK AT WALTER AND SHIRLEY
IN THERE.

40:34.132 --> 40:37.065
I WAS WATCHING THEM DANCE
WITH SUCH PASSION IN THEIR EYES,

40:37.065 --> 40:39.568
BUT I KNOW THEY HAVEN'T
ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT.

40:39.568 --> 40:43.111
THEY'VE HAD THEIR ROUGH TIMES,
TOO, BUT THEY STUCK IT OUT.

40:43.111 --> 40:44.613
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN LOVE.

40:44.613 --> 40:47.616
I ASKED YOU IF YOU LOVED ME,
AND YOU COULDN'T ANSWER.

40:49.177 --> 40:53.682
FINE. I'LL ANSWER YOU NOW.

40:53.682 --> 40:55.984
I LOVED YOU ONCE.

40:55.984 --> 40:59.027
CAN I LOVE YOU AGAIN?

40:59.027 --> 41:00.659
I DON'T KNOW.

41:02.861 --> 41:07.666
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO RECAPTURE
WHAT WE ONCE HAD.

41:10.639 --> 41:13.542
AND HOW CAN WE DO THAT
IF YOU'RE NOT HERE?

41:15.073 --> 41:18.246
SO... I'M ASKING YOU...

41:20.008 --> 41:22.611
PLEASE STAY.

41:43.271 --> 41:47.135
IN THIS NEVER-ENDING DRAMA
WE CALL LIFE,

41:47.135 --> 41:50.679
EVERYONE HAS A PART TO PLAY.

41:52.841 --> 41:56.715
SOME ARE CAST
AS ROMANTIC LEADS.

41:56.715 --> 42:02.520
OTHERS END UP BEING THE VICTIM.

42:02.520 --> 42:08.026
(glasses shatter)
 AND A FEW ALWAYS PROVIDE
COMIC RELIEF.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.527
AND THEN THERE ARE

42:09.527 --> 42:12.861
THOSE WHO END UP
PLAYING THE HERO...

42:14.563 --> 42:19.708
ESPECIALLY IF THEY FEEL
THERE'S A VILLAIN...

42:19.708 --> 42:24.943
WHO LIVES
JUST ACROSS THE STREET.
