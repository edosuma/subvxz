02:41.843 --> 02:44.947
<i>Begin in three, two, one.</i>

02:45.313 --> 02:47.049
<i>You're cleared.</i>

02:55.491 --> 02:59.195
This place... it must end.

03:02.296 --> 03:03.532
Look at me.

03:04.532 --> 03:05.966
Look at me!

03:09.938 --> 03:11.340
I'm so afraid for you.

03:17.979 --> 03:21.849
You know,
I hear the future like a voice.

03:22.116 --> 03:23.652
Do you know what it says?

03:25.687 --> 03:28.490
It says that all of these men
will perish

03:28.556 --> 03:31.593
along with those who help them.

04:33.889 --> 04:35.524
<i>Complete, time recorded.</i>

04:35.723 --> 04:37.324
<i>Please leave, Mr. Carmichael.</i>

04:37.658 --> 04:39.627
<i>Mr. Veidt will be with you
in a moment</i>

04:39.694 --> 04:41.329
<i>to finish your evaluation.</i>

05:04.786 --> 05:07.021
You said you take
your coffee black, yes?

05:07.488 --> 05:10.592
Yeah. I prefer my food
untampered.

05:11.326 --> 05:13.661
Untampered?

05:14.196 --> 05:15.598
That's a way to put it.

05:16.031 --> 05:17.098
Untampered.

05:18.266 --> 05:19.266
I'm Joseph veidt.

05:19.367 --> 05:20.668
You're the one who contacted me?

05:20.836 --> 05:23.538
No. No, I'm the one
who sees the candidates.

05:23.605 --> 05:25.707
I'm the psychologist
of the family.

05:26.574 --> 05:28.610
Times like these,
I prove my usefulness.

05:29.310 --> 05:30.310
Sit down.

05:34.716 --> 05:36.285
Virtually no hesitation.

05:37.752 --> 05:39.788
This is the fastest time
we've seen.

05:41.557 --> 05:43.759
Jaden was programmed to defy,

05:44.093 --> 05:48.831
to evoke an empathy response.
Most people never take the shot.

05:50.199 --> 05:52.167
I know what's alive
and what isn't.

05:52.767 --> 05:54.637
Because we told you
that Jaden was a machine.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.137
But we could have lied to you.

05:57.271 --> 05:58.507
Then you would be a murderer.

05:59.173 --> 06:01.310
Then the veidt corporation
would be my accomplice.

06:01.910 --> 06:04.012
You make machines.
You said it was a machine.

06:05.079 --> 06:07.682
I usually find the simplest way
to look at things is best.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.319
You have military experience.

06:10.952 --> 06:12.587
Do you have problems
with authority?

06:12.954 --> 06:15.824
Anybody ever answer that
question with anything but a no?

06:17.625 --> 06:19.427
Do you have problems
with authority?

06:19.762 --> 06:21.163
No.

06:22.798 --> 06:24.867
You were a police detective.

06:26.168 --> 06:27.468
You retired.

06:28.235 --> 06:30.706
Uh. The file gives no reason
for your retirement.

06:31.540 --> 06:33.275
You're a top-ten listed company.

06:33.742 --> 06:35.343
I'm sure you found out
why I retired.

06:37.144 --> 06:39.180
Well, I would like
to hear it from you.

06:42.685 --> 06:44.685
During the apprehension
of an assailant...

06:44.920 --> 06:47.857
My partner and the assailant
were both fatally wounded.

06:49.024 --> 06:50.024
How?

06:50.091 --> 06:52.127
The assailant took
my partner hostage.

06:52.961 --> 06:54.796
I did not follow protocol.

06:55.730 --> 06:57.432
Why didn't you follow protocol?

07:05.975 --> 07:07.677
Do you regret what you did?

07:08.475 --> 07:09.778
I live with what I did.

07:14.449 --> 07:16.752
Instead of charging you
with a crime,

07:16.851 --> 07:19.153
the police department
allowed you to retire.

07:19.588 --> 07:20.890
Is that a problem?

07:21.357 --> 07:22.358
Not right now.

07:25.060 --> 07:29.131
We reached out to potential
hires through uncommon channels.

07:29.230 --> 07:32.701
It wards off some people.
Why did you respond?

07:33.168 --> 07:34.002
I need the money.

07:34.101 --> 07:35.804
Even though you don't know
what the job is?

07:36.572 --> 07:37.706
Still need the money.

07:38.107 --> 07:40.342
And if I told you the job
was killing someone,

07:40.408 --> 07:41.675
would that change your mind?

07:41.976 --> 07:44.713
Yeah. I'd tell you
to go fuck yourself.

07:45.747 --> 07:46.981
Hmm.

07:49.651 --> 07:51.754
My part of the evaluation
is done.

07:53.988 --> 07:55.924
You've earned the right
to meet my brother.

09:19.941 --> 09:21.277
Hello, David.

09:43.965 --> 09:47.570
Welcome to my humble empire.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.190
Come, come.

10:13.428 --> 10:15.163
The task is my daughter...

10:17.832 --> 10:19.033
Melissa.

10:21.102 --> 10:22.737
Three weeks ago,
she went missing.

10:23.504 --> 10:24.972
And you didn't go to the police?

10:25.405 --> 10:28.076
I don't need them
to find her for me.

10:29.043 --> 10:31.013
I know exactly where she is.

10:33.615 --> 10:35.884
I need someone discreet...

10:37.284 --> 10:42.290
Someone that won't ruin
pragmatism with principle.

10:43.557 --> 10:45.093
I'm not sure I understand.

10:45.827 --> 10:47.362
I'm sure you don't.

10:47.861 --> 10:49.197
Let me assist you.

10:49.998 --> 10:52.568
What do you know about zone 414?

10:55.669 --> 10:57.838
Well, that's the only place
where androids are allowed

10:57.905 --> 10:59.440
to freely interact
with human beings.

11:00.642 --> 11:02.076
My androids.

11:03.144 --> 11:04.178
Yeah.

11:09.350 --> 11:12.187
Do you know what I did
with my technology?

11:13.621 --> 11:16.224
I built the antidote

11:16.291 --> 11:19.295
to the loneliness
of the modern world.

11:20.995 --> 11:24.132
Companionship
is rare these days.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.605
I saw a gap, and I filled it.

11:41.149 --> 11:44.719
So the government
rewarded me with zone 414,

11:45.052 --> 11:47.788
a place where I could
field test my creations

11:47.922 --> 11:51.293
to see how they interact
with humanity.

11:51.993 --> 11:55.297
Zone 414, the city of robots.

11:55.529 --> 11:58.198
Have you been there?

11:59.167 --> 12:02.771
Uh. A cop's wage doesn't usually
afford luxuries, no.

12:03.004 --> 12:05.673
It has become quite
the destination, hasn't it?

12:05.807 --> 12:09.043
My little metropolitan Eden

12:09.211 --> 12:11.513
with all the grime
and none of the crime.

12:14.149 --> 12:17.184
I was advised to charge
100,000 pounds.

12:17.285 --> 12:20.288
I said,
"no, charge one million."

12:20.755 --> 12:21.956
Five days later...

12:22.456 --> 12:26.160
I had a six-month waiting list.

12:26.260 --> 12:28.161
For 20 million pounds,

12:28.229 --> 12:30.465
you could buy
one of my beautiful creations,

12:30.664 --> 12:33.501
and I sold 17 last year.

12:34.434 --> 12:37.838
Of course you have
to apply for a license,

12:37.938 --> 12:42.409
submit yourself to government
monitoring and blah-blah-blah.

12:42.710 --> 12:45.146
I didn't know it was legal
to have 'em outside the zone.

12:45.647 --> 12:47.516
It isn't for someone like you.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.522
Mr. Carmichael...

12:55.289 --> 12:57.525
My daughter is in zone 414,

12:57.592 --> 13:00.961
and I need you to retrieve her
for me...

13:01.028 --> 13:02.331
Without incident.

13:03.030 --> 13:05.866
You see, my Eden is fragile.

13:06.268 --> 13:09.738
It may look like a city,
but it is as much a construction

13:09.871 --> 13:12.707
as the machine
standing behind me.

13:15.309 --> 13:21.049
People must feel that the place
is safe... controlled.

13:21.883 --> 13:23.218
Police searching

13:23.317 --> 13:24.918
for my
troublemaking offspring...

13:24.985 --> 13:27.254
Would upset the balance.

13:29.057 --> 13:30.793
I need you to bring her
back to me.

13:32.126 --> 13:35.863
Your original offer
was one million pounds.

13:35.929 --> 13:37.565
Well, now it's two...

13:39.000 --> 13:40.601
'Cause you are
the right fit for this.

13:41.035 --> 13:42.503
I can see that.

13:43.270 --> 13:44.705
How do you know
she's even in there?

13:46.274 --> 13:48.210
It is the only place
she would go.

13:52.313 --> 13:53.314
Hmm.

13:54.115 --> 13:55.716
That will get you into the zone.

13:55.817 --> 13:57.851
And whatever else you need
whilst you're there

13:57.918 --> 13:59.420
will be provided for you.

14:01.722 --> 14:05.560
And when you get there,
find Jane.

14:06.628 --> 14:09.097
Who's Jane?

14:09.230 --> 14:12.067
Jane might be my best creation.

14:12.333 --> 14:17.472
Problematic at times,
but, oh, so unique.

14:19.407 --> 14:22.043
Melissa was always
so fond of her.

14:22.143 --> 14:26.148
I would start your search there.

14:29.951 --> 14:31.253
Hmm.

14:35.190 --> 14:37.659
<i>Well, hello, Jane.</i>

14:39.027 --> 14:40.796
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

14:41.830 --> 14:43.865
<i>Are you feeling fine?</i>

14:51.239 --> 14:55.244
<i>I wanted to see
what you're made of, Jane.</i>

14:56.277 --> 14:57.913
<i>I would die for you.</i>

14:59.413 --> 15:01.884
<i>I'm gonna make you die for me.</i>

15:04.251 --> 15:08.156
<i>I'm gonna have to hurt you bad.</i>

15:11.359 --> 15:12.594
<i>The veidt corporation</i>

15:12.659 --> 15:14.596
<i>cannot be held responsible
for any damage</i>

15:14.696 --> 15:17.666
<i>to personal property

<i>Any Android malfunction

15:36.183 --> 15:37.418
Turn around.

15:45.759 --> 15:46.759
Face me.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.536
And I can ask 'em
anything I want?

15:55.035 --> 15:56.437
Anything you want.

16:03.311 --> 16:04.580
Tell me you love me.

16:05.279 --> 16:06.480
I love you.

16:08.683 --> 16:09.784
Tell me again.

16:10.885 --> 16:11.885
I love you.

16:12.419 --> 16:15.256
Um. Not this one.

16:16.890 --> 16:17.892
She looks too smart.

16:19.527 --> 16:21.330
Let me show you the others.

16:42.383 --> 16:44.253
One of our top sellers.

16:45.687 --> 16:46.687
Turn around.

16:55.562 --> 16:56.564
Face me.

17:03.038 --> 17:04.272
Touch her.

17:08.876 --> 17:10.044
Hmm.

17:17.050 --> 17:18.119
Hmm.

17:18.220 --> 17:20.389
You're warm.

17:26.260 --> 17:27.596
Tell me that you love me.

17:28.796 --> 17:29.865
I love you.

17:36.804 --> 17:37.906
Tell me again.

17:38.772 --> 17:40.841
I love you.

17:53.186 --> 17:55.956
No, not this one.

17:58.192 --> 17:59.428
Understood.

18:00.260 --> 18:01.462
Follow me.

18:19.547 --> 18:23.985
If you would like a man,
all you need to do is ask.

18:26.020 --> 18:32.426
What you choose here
remains absolutely confidential.

18:52.446 --> 18:54.782
<i>Vehicle approaching. Stand by.</i>

19:06.827 --> 19:07.827
Go in.

19:11.432 --> 19:12.432
Open the gate!

19:12.467 --> 19:14.634
<i>Warning. Gate opening.</i>

19:15.001 --> 19:17.271
<i>Warning. Gate opening.</i>

19:17.505 --> 19:19.775
<i>Warning. Gate opening.</i>

19:30.951 --> 19:32.721
<i>Any Android malfunction</i>

<i>Please use our androids

19:39.594 --> 19:41.930
<i>Continuous use of droids

19:47.102 --> 19:48.470
Did I get it right?

19:51.673 --> 19:53.474
It's important
that I get it right.

19:56.176 --> 19:57.545
You look beautiful.

19:59.881 --> 20:01.983
Something's still wrong,
isn't it?

20:03.884 --> 20:04.884
Yes.

20:07.188 --> 20:08.557
Her hair was blond.

20:11.424 --> 20:13.894
That's it. Just like that.

20:16.830 --> 20:17.865
Yes.

20:26.740 --> 20:28.609
I don't want to look like her.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.983
All I want is
to feel something real.

20:37.984 --> 20:40.754
But I can't control that.
Only you can.

20:42.789 --> 20:46.961
I do what you want.
You make this real.

20:49.230 --> 20:50.899
I want to see more of you.

20:52.066 --> 20:53.201
Then ask me.

20:55.670 --> 20:57.205
Unbutton your shirt.

21:17.490 --> 21:18.894
Stop, stop.

21:20.996 --> 21:22.030
Leave it there.

21:23.265 --> 21:24.566
Just like that.

21:57.664 --> 21:59.166
Tell me more about her.

22:00.768 --> 22:02.170
Take us away from here.

22:04.972 --> 22:07.709
I saw her in an alleyway
behind the school,

22:08.509 --> 22:09.944
and she was...

22:11.346 --> 22:12.747
She was...

22:13.846 --> 22:15.750
Smoking a joint.

22:20.855 --> 22:23.891
She saw me, she called me over

22:23.990 --> 22:28.429
and said that if I promised
never to tell anyone,

22:28.628 --> 22:30.164
she would let me try.

22:31.365 --> 22:33.867
And she did. She let me.

22:35.603 --> 22:37.772
On the joint, I could taste her.

22:37.872 --> 22:39.274
Mm-hmm.

22:42.609 --> 22:44.044
You didn't taste her.

22:44.612 --> 22:46.013
You tasted me.

22:54.688 --> 22:57.225
I never told anyone I saw you.

22:58.259 --> 22:59.827
I know.

23:04.932 --> 23:06.701
So I'm a... I'm a good boy.

23:06.934 --> 23:10.503
Yeah, you were.
You kept our secret.

23:10.570 --> 23:11.939
Yeah.

23:20.682 --> 23:22.049
Yes.

23:42.670 --> 23:44.005
Alpha.

23:44.239 --> 23:45.406
<i>Yes, Jane?</i>

23:46.374 --> 23:47.741
How many more do I have today?

23:48.275 --> 23:51.644
<i>You can remotely access
the mainframe and have your...</i>

23:51.711 --> 23:53.047
No, I'd like to hear it.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.748
<i>Of course, Jane.</i>

23:55.148 --> 23:57.951
<i>You have two more
appointments today.</i>

23:59.353 --> 24:01.788
After my appointments,
I want a maintenance session.

24:02.190 --> 24:04.726
<i>I look forward
to our conversation.</i>

24:05.125 --> 24:07.228
<i>Will there be
anything else, Jane?</i>

24:07.428 --> 24:08.730
No, thank you, Alpha.

24:21.576 --> 24:24.178
<i>The veidt corporation

24:24.311 --> 24:28.214

26:04.111 --> 26:05.246
<i>Hello, David.</i>

26:05.313 --> 26:07.448
<i>Is there anything we can do
to make your space</i>

26:07.515 --> 26:08.282
<i>more comfortable?</i>

26:08.449 --> 26:11.085
Yeah. Don't speak to me again.

26:12.019 --> 26:13.621
When I'm alone,
I like to be alone.

26:13.988 --> 26:15.789
<i>Of course. Let me remind you</i>

26:15.856 --> 26:18.593
<i>that your special request
is in the other room.</i>

26:20.728 --> 26:22.130
<i>Good evening, David.</i>

26:22.696 --> 26:23.997
<i>Welcome to the zone.</i>

27:50.218 --> 27:52.019
I met a man tonight.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.020
I can make him want me.

27:54.422 --> 27:59.460
<i>Yes, you speak
of client 389, Mr. Russell.</i>

27:59.727 --> 28:02.163
Mm-hmm. I can...

28:02.229 --> 28:06.467
<i>He has requested never
to be matched with you again.</i>

28:18.246 --> 28:19.246
Why?

28:19.480 --> 28:22.750
<i>He was completely
satisfied with your encounter.</i>

28:23.183 --> 28:26.186
<i>He did not want to ruin
the memory of it.</i>

28:27.555 --> 28:28.555
<i>You did well.</i>

28:34.295 --> 28:36.663
I want to put a shotgun
in my mouth

28:36.730 --> 28:38.031
and pull the trigger.

28:40.934 --> 28:43.637
Was I programmed
to feel that way?

28:44.571 --> 28:46.573
Despair, yes.

28:47.375 --> 28:51.244
Powerful men are very attracted
to those who suffer,

28:51.645 --> 28:52.812
to the helpless.

28:53.647 --> 28:58.019
Client 389, Mr. Russell,
will speak with his friends.

28:58.419 --> 29:02.256
They will request you.
You will do well with them.

29:10.163 --> 29:11.566
There's something else.

29:16.170 --> 29:18.538
Someone has been
sending me messages.

29:20.074 --> 29:21.676
What kind of messages?

29:22.109 --> 29:23.443
Voice messages.

29:24.444 --> 29:27.781
The voice is distorted,
but it's a man's voice.

29:29.982 --> 29:31.551
He doesn't tell me his name.

29:32.752 --> 29:34.087
What does he say?

29:34.954 --> 29:36.656
That he's going to kill me.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.728
And you believe
that you are afraid.

29:41.994 --> 29:43.663
Yes, I believe I'm afraid.

29:43.897 --> 29:45.264
I will review these messages.

29:45.332 --> 29:49.704
I am certain
there is a simple explanation.

29:49.804 --> 29:51.371
Yes, someone wants to kill me.

29:51.471 --> 29:54.775
Or someone is paying
for the ability

29:54.842 --> 29:56.910
to make you believe that.

29:57.443 --> 30:01.682
You were created
to serve the clients, Jane.

30:02.048 --> 30:04.617
If a client wants
to threaten you,

30:04.884 --> 30:08.489
I am certain
he is paying to do so.

30:09.557 --> 30:12.293
And what if he's paying
for the right to kill me?

30:13.894 --> 30:17.865
Zone 414 does not allow clients

30:18.065 --> 30:20.500
to pay for that experience.

30:23.471 --> 30:26.574
Oh, I should mention
you will have a visitor tonight.

30:28.208 --> 30:29.844
His name is David.

30:31.310 --> 30:34.615
<i>The veidt droid 6855

30:34.681 --> 30:37.951

30:51.298 --> 30:54.301

35:10.657 --> 35:13.227
Hey, you Jane? I'm David.

35:13.460 --> 35:15.596
I'm looking for Melissa veidt.
Her father sent me.

35:16.028 --> 35:17.063
Melissa?

35:17.364 --> 35:18.965
Yeah. Can I come in?

35:41.521 --> 35:44.190
- What happened to Melissa?
- I don't know.

35:44.690 --> 35:46.793
That's what her father
sent me here to find out.

35:51.164 --> 35:52.932
You look uncomfortable, David.

35:56.336 --> 35:57.737
Well, you have an apartment.

35:58.371 --> 35:59.639
I do.

36:00.340 --> 36:02.108
Why does a machine
need an apartment?

36:03.342 --> 36:05.812
So the machine forgets
it's a machine.

36:24.931 --> 36:25.998
Nah, I'm good.

36:26.132 --> 36:27.167
Not a drinker?

36:27.835 --> 36:28.835
I try not to be.

36:30.570 --> 36:33.072
The last time
I saw Melissa was weeks ago.

36:34.474 --> 36:36.010
<i>She used to come here.</i>

36:37.577 --> 36:39.914
I found her pretending
to be a synthetic.

36:41.047 --> 36:43.482
- Why would she do that?
- She hates her father.

36:43.983 --> 36:46.119
She hates the fact
that she's a rich girl

36:46.186 --> 36:47.186
who hates her father.

36:47.521 --> 36:49.223
She calls herself a cliché.

36:50.056 --> 36:52.625
She told me she came here
to pretend to be a synthetic

36:53.193 --> 36:55.663
because synths
don't have to feel anything.

36:57.697 --> 36:59.232
So you're a friend
of hers, right?

37:01.001 --> 37:05.972
Hmm. We had conversations...
When she came here.

37:06.739 --> 37:08.942
I'm the metal girl
who wants to be real,

37:09.076 --> 37:11.711
and she's the human girl
who wants to be a machine.

37:12.512 --> 37:14.882
It's nice and corny.
Look, I haven't seen her.

37:15.114 --> 37:17.617
I told her to go back
to her big house.

37:18.050 --> 37:21.154
The last thing I wanted was Roy
believing she was a synthetic.

37:22.121 --> 37:23.155
Who's Roy?

37:23.389 --> 37:25.492
Royale.

37:29.996 --> 37:31.197
The meat who manages us,

37:31.998 --> 37:36.102
preps us for the clients
for purchase.

37:37.336 --> 37:38.905
Can you take me to see her?

37:40.139 --> 37:41.741
- Me?
- Yes.

37:42.476 --> 37:43.611
No.

37:44.978 --> 37:47.648
See, you asked me.
That makes you can't make me.

37:48.081 --> 37:50.416
And if you can't make me,
then my answer is no.

37:51.150 --> 37:54.288
I don't need anymore trouble.
I have enough of that.

37:56.056 --> 37:59.025
Give it time.
Melissa will go home.

38:00.994 --> 38:03.394
You said you don't need any more
trouble. What kinda trouble?

38:07.266 --> 38:08.568
Are we negotiating?

38:10.003 --> 38:12.172
If you help me find Melissa,
I'll look into it for you.

38:12.606 --> 38:14.542
And how exactly can you help me?

38:15.275 --> 38:16.610
Depends what's required.

38:20.947 --> 38:22.016
Hmm.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.685
- Alpha.
- <i>Yes, Jane?</i>

38:26.853 --> 38:28.289
Play today's messages.

38:31.657 --> 38:33.826
<i>Well, hello, Jane.</i>

38:35.128 --> 38:36.864
<i>How are you today?</i>

38:37.597 --> 38:39.967
<i>I'm feeling fine.</i>

38:47.173 --> 38:51.277
<i>I wanted to see
what you're made of, Jane.</i>

38:52.344 --> 38:54.213
<i>I would die for you.</i>

38:55.014 --> 38:57.951
<i>I'm gonna make you die for me.</i>

38:59.652 --> 39:02.855
<i>I'm gonna have to hurt you bad.</i>

39:09.762 --> 39:11.264
It started a few weeks ago.

39:13.365 --> 39:15.001
Now I get one every few days.

39:15.434 --> 39:16.836
Sometimes once a day.

39:18.871 --> 39:21.341
He's probably a client
paying the zone to do it.

39:22.541 --> 39:24.777
People have paid
to do worse things to me.

39:26.045 --> 39:27.980
It'd be good
to put a stop to it.

39:28.282 --> 39:30.050
Listen, you're the first
synthetic veidt made

39:30.117 --> 39:32.085
for this place.
I'm gonna need your experience,

39:32.152 --> 39:34.855
and you're gonna take me
to see this Roy, okay?

39:37.490 --> 39:39.393
Now that you're telling me,
then yes.

39:43.528 --> 39:44.764
What?

39:45.465 --> 39:46.934
I think you might
have a visitor.

39:47.599 --> 39:48.802
Lock the door behind me

39:48.969 --> 39:50.570
and don't open it
till I come back,

39:50.637 --> 39:52.072
until you hear my voice, okay?

40:07.420 --> 40:08.755
Don't move!

40:12.692 --> 40:14.059
I said don't move!

40:53.432 --> 40:55.735
<i>Any Android

40:55.802 --> 40:58.706

41:28.601 --> 41:29.669
Stay right there.

41:29.969 --> 41:32.940
Don't fuckin' move.

41:40.847 --> 41:43.182
Fuck.

41:56.463 --> 41:57.765
He was in my loft?

41:58.063 --> 41:59.063
Yeah.

42:00.900 --> 42:03.936
I'm not supposed to feel
emotions, but I'm terrified.

42:04.670 --> 42:05.905
Explain that to me.

42:06.373 --> 42:08.909
He's not gonna come back again.
He knows I saw him.

42:09.809 --> 42:11.178
He'll change what he does.

42:13.413 --> 42:14.981
You want me
to stay here tonight?

42:15.047 --> 42:17.049
Then you can take me to see
royale in the morning.

42:18.351 --> 42:20.353
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

42:26.893 --> 42:28.295
You're helping me.

42:31.230 --> 42:32.230
Why?

42:35.835 --> 42:37.403
That's not why you came to me.

42:37.536 --> 42:39.472
No, it's not. Does it matter?

42:42.240 --> 42:43.976
I'm just trying
to understand you.

42:44.344 --> 42:45.445
Well, good luck.

42:46.746 --> 42:48.014
<i>Quid pro quo.</i>

42:48.914 --> 42:50.150
I need your help.

43:07.634 --> 43:10.237
I like to listen to music
when I rest.

43:11.170 --> 43:13.472
However you do it.

43:17.844 --> 43:19.278
Resume playback.

44:12.599 --> 44:13.600
Turn it down.

44:14.900 --> 44:16.302
Lights.

44:35.922 --> 44:37.624

I know it wasn't today.

45:34.380 --> 45:36.649
Well, how about where?
Where did you see her?

45:42.454 --> 45:45.123
I appreciate the fact
that Jane is your tour guide,

45:45.657 --> 45:48.494
but I don't talk about my life
in front of the help.

45:50.795 --> 45:52.198
Jane, would you step outside?

46:04.110 --> 46:05.312
Did you fuck her?

46:05.579 --> 46:06.579
No.

46:06.746 --> 46:08.581
Good. Don't trust her.

46:09.081 --> 46:10.282
See, veidt won't tell you,

46:10.817 --> 46:13.385
but there's something wrong
with the way they made her.

46:14.253 --> 46:18.025
She doesn't turn off
like she's supposed to.

46:18.657 --> 46:19.925
She asks questions.

46:20.126 --> 46:22.362
Questions she shouldn't want
the answers to.

46:23.096 --> 46:24.664
Marlon should reprogram her,

46:25.030 --> 46:26.766
but he's too proud
of what she is.

46:34.773 --> 46:35.775
Not for me.

46:46.018 --> 46:47.152
You know what I told veidt?

46:47.619 --> 46:50.188
I told him he should
break her down into tinfoil,

46:50.489 --> 46:54.760
but he thinks she's some kind
of technological snowflake.

46:55.561 --> 46:57.163
Beautiful and unique.

46:59.365 --> 47:01.467
When god makes
something special,

47:02.702 --> 47:04.137
he makes it fragile.

47:04.637 --> 47:05.704
When we make something,

47:06.172 --> 47:07.773
we want to keep it
alive forever.

47:09.208 --> 47:10.677
Can we get back to Melissa?

47:13.179 --> 47:16.750
Where she is... where she is.

47:19.885 --> 47:21.221
I know someone who might know,

47:22.454 --> 47:24.590
but I have to prep you
for it first.

47:25.391 --> 47:27.726
See, I'm the rarefied air here.

47:29.929 --> 47:32.666
My world is a brochure.

47:37.001 --> 47:38.471
You know what rich people want?

47:39.639 --> 47:40.639
No.

47:41.641 --> 47:42.709
Everything.

47:43.476 --> 47:44.677
I facilitate.

47:45.344 --> 47:46.512
There's some ugly in it,

47:46.579 --> 47:48.381
but all in all,
it's a fine solution

47:48.447 --> 47:52.518
to mother nature's fuck-up
inside the core of humanity.

47:56.255 --> 47:57.791
But it's not the only
world here.

48:03.262 --> 48:05.398
Some people
don't want them pretty.

48:05.998 --> 48:07.433
They want the metal.

48:10.268 --> 48:12.338
There's a building
at the edge of the zone.

48:14.940 --> 48:16.376
Here's the address.

48:17.643 --> 48:19.778
I'm writing it down
because I don't like hearing it

48:19.844 --> 48:21.147
in my own voice.

48:22.514 --> 48:25.551
I put in a lot of effort
trying to pretend

48:26.284 --> 48:27.753
that place doesn't exist.

48:29.188 --> 48:31.423
That's my tithe
to your noble cause.

48:32.425 --> 48:34.227
Now I have dreams to fulfill.

48:42.601 --> 48:45.036
Someone's been stalking Jane.

48:45.670 --> 48:47.339
They were at her apartment
last night.

48:48.740 --> 48:50.943
So you were at her apartment
last night.

48:52.045 --> 48:53.479
Jane thinks maybe
somebody's paying

48:53.545 --> 48:56.215
for the ability to do that,
to stalk her.

48:57.215 --> 48:58.684
You think I would know about it?

48:59.619 --> 49:01.488
Well, you're the rarefied air.

49:05.025 --> 49:08.961
I don't get paid to give
these sickos what they want.

49:09.362 --> 49:11.931
I get paid to keep the world
from finding out

49:12.030 --> 49:13.900
what these sickos want.

49:14.867 --> 49:16.002
I am discretion.

49:16.635 --> 49:19.404
If I did know,
I wouldn't tell you.

49:19.771 --> 49:20.873
But I don't.

49:23.909 --> 49:25.511
You trying to save Jane now?

49:29.748 --> 49:32.618
Veidt is paying you
to find the girl.

49:33.452 --> 49:36.454
It's a shit job,
so you need the money.

49:37.289 --> 49:40.260
Find the girl,
get your money and leave.

49:58.177 --> 49:59.711
<i>Royale, hi.</i>

50:00.012 --> 50:01.292
Someone's coming about the girl.

50:01.447 --> 50:02.849
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

50:03.516 --> 50:06.519
Tell him where she is,
and you keep me out of it.

50:07.253 --> 50:09.588
Mention me, and I will kill you.

50:14.827 --> 50:16.296
Fuck!

51:52.657 --> 51:55.461
Melissa veidt?

51:55.961 --> 51:56.961
Yeah.

52:01.367 --> 52:02.501
Forgive the mood lighting.

52:02.635 --> 52:05.638
My skin reacts badly
to sunlight.

52:13.646 --> 52:16.583
I'm George,
and this is Hamilton.

52:18.050 --> 52:19.119
Say hello, Hamilton.

52:19.684 --> 52:20.684
Hello.

52:21.086 --> 52:22.822
And this is our friend, Jaden.

52:25.391 --> 52:27.126
She's a little bit shy,
I'm afraid.

52:29.061 --> 52:31.273
Royale gave me the impression
you may know the whereabouts

52:31.297 --> 52:32.565
of Melissa veidt.

52:33.565 --> 52:36.769
So you've endured
a conversation with royale?

52:37.170 --> 52:38.570
My condolences.

52:40.072 --> 52:43.108
Yes, Hamilton found her
at the entrance of the building.

52:43.309 --> 52:44.677
She was lost.

52:48.380 --> 52:50.549
And I... I thought
she was a synthetic.

52:51.050 --> 52:52.752
You say she was human?

52:53.385 --> 52:54.521
Yeah.

52:55.320 --> 52:57.056
She was only here
for a few hours.

52:57.123 --> 52:58.123
She seemed...

52:59.291 --> 53:02.694
Well, she seemed frightened.

53:05.063 --> 53:06.164
I didn't ask her why.

53:06.833 --> 53:08.793
A young girl turns up
on your doorstep frightened,

53:08.835 --> 53:10.135
and you didn't ask
any questions?

53:11.936 --> 53:14.373
When you don't like
to answer questions,

53:14.739 --> 53:17.009
you quickly learn
not to ask any.

53:18.077 --> 53:19.077
Ah.

53:19.478 --> 53:22.781
She seemed rather... delicate.

53:25.117 --> 53:26.117
Damaged.

53:28.920 --> 53:31.422
I have a penchant
for damaged things,

53:31.489 --> 53:33.492
don't I, Hamilton?

53:38.297 --> 53:39.666
Your model is lovely.

53:41.534 --> 53:43.134
Did Melissa tell you
where she was going?

53:43.768 --> 53:45.571
They can feel pain, you know.

53:46.472 --> 53:47.674
In their own way.

53:48.940 --> 53:49.940
Yes.

53:51.577 --> 53:52.745
They scream.

53:55.681 --> 53:57.150
Did she say where she was going?

54:00.519 --> 54:02.655
You haven't asked about my face

54:02.721 --> 54:06.592
or how a human has taken up
permanent residence in the zone.

54:07.059 --> 54:08.059
I have no interest.

54:08.159 --> 54:10.061
I'm just trying to find
Marlon veidt's daughter.

54:10.128 --> 54:11.163
Hmm.

54:13.431 --> 54:15.033
Let me think.
She did say something

54:15.101 --> 54:16.769
about where she was going.

54:18.237 --> 54:19.237
Something.

54:20.806 --> 54:22.875
Any information
would be helpful.

54:23.208 --> 54:24.644
Yes, so it would seem.

54:26.878 --> 54:29.214
Or perhaps a trade
would be in order.

54:31.617 --> 54:32.894
I could tell you
everything I know

54:32.918 --> 54:35.287
about the whereabouts
of your Melissa

54:35.353 --> 54:38.190
in exchange for one small favor.

54:39.023 --> 54:40.058
What kinda favor?

54:40.192 --> 54:41.927
Two hours with your model.

54:43.929 --> 54:46.231
She's lovely,
isn't she, Hamilton?

54:46.331 --> 54:48.667
Yes, lovely.

54:51.704 --> 54:53.639
You provide me with that,
and then I'll tell you

54:53.706 --> 54:56.608
where your little girl
scuttled off to.

55:02.447 --> 55:04.382
Oh, don't worry.

55:04.449 --> 55:07.152
I wouldn't do anything
too drastic.

55:07.954 --> 55:10.957
At least nothing the veidt
corporation couldn't repair.

55:11.856 --> 55:14.994
I'm not interested in sex,
per se.

55:15.494 --> 55:20.333
I have slightly more intricate,
less obvious interests.

55:22.402 --> 55:24.336
Where did Melissa go?

55:24.402 --> 55:26.004
- Get her off me!
- Where did she go?

55:26.105 --> 55:28.340
I tell royale,
she'll have you broken down.

55:28.407 --> 55:29.776
Not if I kill you.

55:31.409 --> 55:32.409
Melissa!

55:32.777 --> 55:35.346
Royale gave her to me.
I... I didn't know she was human.

55:35.414 --> 55:38.451
- What did you do to her?
- N... nothing. She... she disappeared.

55:38.516 --> 55:41.419
H... Hamilton went to find her,
but she'd slipped away.

55:41.521 --> 55:42.521
She was gone.

55:42.621 --> 55:43.756
The boatyard! The boatyard!

55:43.822 --> 55:45.023
- Boatyard.
- The boatyard?

55:45.224 --> 55:47.202
- The boatyard.
- The boatyard! Where's the boatyard?

55:47.226 --> 55:49.561
It's at the end of the zone,
b... behind the dump.

55:49.661 --> 55:51.230
No one ever goes there.

55:51.429 --> 55:52.463
That's all I know.

55:52.597 --> 55:54.132
Do you know where that is?

55:54.333 --> 55:56.436
Get her off me! Get off!

55:58.003 --> 55:59.003
Let's go.

56:05.677 --> 56:07.780
Get off!

56:14.018 --> 56:15.338
I thought you were
gonna kill him.

56:17.056 --> 56:18.976
I can't imagine you're
supposed to be doing that.

57:13.945 --> 57:14.945
Melissa?

57:27.326 --> 57:28.326
Melissa!

58:02.695 --> 58:03.863
You wait here.

59:30.782 --> 59:32.116
<i>Mr. Carmichael,</i>

59:32.818 --> 59:35.588
were you successful
in finding Melissa veidt?

59:39.391 --> 59:40.592
Mr. Carmichael?

59:56.242 --> 59:57.243
Huh.

59:59.445 --> 1:00:04.115
Well, it seems
the matter is resolved.

1:00:06.184 --> 1:00:08.520
I don't think it's resolved,
Mr. Veidt.

1:00:09.788 --> 1:00:11.456
Melissa is dead.

1:00:13.025 --> 1:00:14.760
I don't believe
she committed suicide.

1:00:15.226 --> 1:00:17.462
You found her hanging.

1:00:17.630 --> 1:00:19.632
In an empty shed
with nothing to stand on.

1:00:20.498 --> 1:00:23.001
I've seen suicides, sir.
They don't look like this.

1:00:25.737 --> 1:00:26.737
Oh.

1:00:30.809 --> 1:00:31.911
I understand.

1:00:34.378 --> 1:00:35.947
And there will be
a trail of evidence...

1:00:36.014 --> 1:00:39.385
Your services are
no longer required, David.

1:00:40.786 --> 1:00:44.090
We will Bury her and...

1:00:45.490 --> 1:00:46.992
That will be the end of it.

1:00:48.193 --> 1:00:50.996
You have a murderer in the zone.

1:00:51.496 --> 1:00:55.533
There's not been one single act
of violence in zone 414

1:00:55.601 --> 1:00:56.969
since its inception.

1:00:57.969 --> 1:00:59.171
That must remain.

1:01:01.773 --> 1:01:06.612
My clients pay for the absolute
certainty of their safety.

1:01:06.778 --> 1:01:08.289
With all due respect,
some of your clients

1:01:08.313 --> 1:01:10.916
are questionable, and I think
they ought to be investigated.

1:01:12.784 --> 1:01:17.188
Destroying a multi-billion
pound empire...

1:01:17.356 --> 1:01:20.226
Will not bring my daughter
back to life.

1:01:21.927 --> 1:01:26.999
An investigation of the zone
will end the zone...

1:01:28.099 --> 1:01:30.168
And I will not allow
that to happen.

1:01:31.670 --> 1:01:33.079
I also think
you ought to investigate

1:01:33.103 --> 1:01:34.439
some of your employees.

1:01:35.005 --> 1:01:36.509
Royale, for example.

1:01:46.318 --> 1:01:51.958
You look,
but you do not see, David.

1:01:54.092 --> 1:01:56.927
David, the man with the name

1:01:56.994 --> 1:02:00.532
of the second
and greatest king of Israel.

1:02:02.434 --> 1:02:03.970
The giant slayer.

1:02:05.403 --> 1:02:06.472
Hmm?

1:02:08.172 --> 1:02:10.475
Are you a man
of religion, David?

1:02:11.275 --> 1:02:12.577
I can't say that I am.

1:02:12.677 --> 1:02:15.347
Ah! See, I disagree.

1:02:15.914 --> 1:02:17.383
You have a god.

1:02:18.583 --> 1:02:19.985
The god of reason.

1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:23.255
But there is another god.

1:02:24.590 --> 1:02:25.590
Hmm?

1:02:25.925 --> 1:02:28.427
The god of power.

1:02:28.626 --> 1:02:30.730
And for zone 414...

1:02:32.431 --> 1:02:34.266
I am that god.

1:02:34.532 --> 1:02:35.735
Do you understand?

1:02:37.135 --> 1:02:41.039
Can you reach
into your working-class mind

1:02:41.539 --> 1:02:45.844
and see a glimpse
of my responsibility?

1:02:46.077 --> 1:02:47.278
Can you, David?

1:02:48.380 --> 1:02:51.083
The man with the name of a king

1:02:51.148 --> 1:02:53.184
who thinks like a soldier.

1:02:54.418 --> 1:02:58.155
The purpose of a king
is not to grieve his Princess.

1:02:58.289 --> 1:03:01.027
It is to protect his kingdom.

1:03:02.527 --> 1:03:06.597
You are a small man, David. Hmm.
A very small man.

1:03:07.298 --> 1:03:11.369
And if you have any intention
of destroying what I have built,

1:03:11.570 --> 1:03:15.874
if you stand in the way
of the god of power,

1:03:15.974 --> 1:03:20.378
he will crush you
under his heel!

1:03:22.581 --> 1:03:26.684
I am not a Goliath
that you can slay.

1:03:28.186 --> 1:03:31.724
I am not.

1:03:33.224 --> 1:03:34.558
I have no intention
of destroying

1:03:34.626 --> 1:03:37.496
what you've built, Mr. Veidt.

1:03:38.664 --> 1:03:40.165
My daughter is dead.

1:03:40.266 --> 1:03:42.568
Do you understand that?

1:03:43.635 --> 1:03:45.203
My daughter is dead!

1:03:45.302 --> 1:03:48.139
Small men need to be
paid too, Mr. Veidt.

1:03:53.945 --> 1:03:55.081
Of course.

1:03:56.514 --> 1:03:58.183
Money, money, money.

1:04:02.820 --> 1:04:06.192
You'll finalize the matter
with my brother in the morning.

1:04:07.358 --> 1:04:08.427
Before you leave tomorrow,

1:04:08.492 --> 1:04:11.130
the funds will be
in your account.

1:04:11.297 --> 1:04:13.865
Now go.

1:04:15.701 --> 1:04:16.769
I need to mourn.

1:04:44.795 --> 1:04:47.198
Just promise me
you'll take these feelings away,

1:04:47.264 --> 1:04:48.866
and I'll give you
anything you want.

1:04:54.072 --> 1:04:55.307
We didn't kill her.

1:04:57.141 --> 1:04:59.744
Melissa veidt killed herself.

1:05:02.413 --> 1:05:04.250
All you have to do is choose.

1:05:05.250 --> 1:05:06.684
Choose to believe that.

1:05:08.152 --> 1:05:09.521
Choose to put it all down.

1:05:12.257 --> 1:05:13.559
That's what I do.

1:05:20.465 --> 1:05:24.202
Just stop thinking
and everything will be fine.

1:05:26.271 --> 1:05:29.942
Be what I want,
and I'll take care of you.

1:05:35.579 --> 1:05:37.549
Don't you want me
to take care of you?

1:05:58.971 --> 1:06:00.206
Can I come in?

1:06:01.806 --> 1:06:02.907
Yeah.

1:06:06.612 --> 1:06:08.247
Please don't ask
where I've been.

1:06:10.882 --> 1:06:12.451
You want something to drink?

1:06:13.251 --> 1:06:14.420
What you're having.

1:06:29.001 --> 1:06:30.603
I killed Melissa.

1:06:34.039 --> 1:06:37.276
She snuck into the zone a lot,
more than her father knew.

1:06:38.409 --> 1:06:39.577
I knew who she was,

1:06:39.643 --> 1:06:41.679
and she made me promise
not to tell anyone.

1:06:51.523 --> 1:06:53.191
I introduced her to Roy,

1:06:53.557 --> 1:06:55.693
and I didn't tell her
she wasn't synthetic.

1:06:59.563 --> 1:07:00.865
It's my fault, David.

1:07:02.400 --> 1:07:04.802
You didn't kill her, Jane.

1:07:07.505 --> 1:07:10.007
Roy might have put that rope
around her neck and I...

1:07:11.643 --> 1:07:14.478
You can't tell Marlon, please.
You can't tell him

1:07:14.878 --> 1:07:18.616
because he'll destroy everyone
he knows that was involved.

1:07:19.717 --> 1:07:23.154
- And Roy, right?
- Your master.

1:07:23.621 --> 1:07:25.723
Mr. Veidt will destroy
her too, yeah?

1:07:27.125 --> 1:07:29.260
Well, I wouldn't be
too concerned.

1:07:29.860 --> 1:07:31.462
Veidt's gonna pretend
it didn't matter.

1:07:31.530 --> 1:07:32.665
I told him already.

1:07:34.364 --> 1:07:35.608
He's just gonna
Bury his daughter

1:07:35.632 --> 1:07:36.968
and act like nothing happened.

1:07:38.735 --> 1:07:41.972
So Roy's got nothing
to worry about.

1:07:42.039 --> 1:07:43.041
Your master is safe.

1:07:43.375 --> 1:07:45.177
Roy is not my fucking master.

1:07:45.342 --> 1:07:46.677
Yeah. Well,
you tell yourself that

1:07:46.777 --> 1:07:49.179
if it makes you feel more human.
It's one of the benefits.

1:07:49.780 --> 1:07:51.583
Believe as many lies
as you want.

1:07:52.983 --> 1:07:57.087
It's what Melissa did, right?
She believed you, yeah?

1:07:57.188 --> 1:07:58.468
She believed
you were her friend,

1:07:59.090 --> 1:08:02.528
that you're capable of love,
more than just a fuckin' robot.

1:08:04.663 --> 1:08:08.199
She trusted you,
and she trusted this place.

1:08:08.300 --> 1:08:09.535
That's what killed her.

1:08:11.135 --> 1:08:12.938
You have no right.

1:08:13.905 --> 1:08:16.809
You can't just come in here
and say these things.

1:08:18.176 --> 1:08:20.679
Can't you see I'm just
a fuckin' prisoner here?

1:08:20.878 --> 1:08:21.880
You know what I see?

1:08:23.581 --> 1:08:25.417
I see people coming here
to avoid their lives.

1:08:25.484 --> 1:08:26.951
And yeah, you're part of that.

1:08:27.652 --> 1:08:29.087
But you're
not the prisoner, Jane.

1:08:30.555 --> 1:08:31.689
You're the prison.

1:08:37.362 --> 1:08:38.931
Carmichael, David Hansen.

1:08:39.864 --> 1:08:41.699
Served in the marines
for three years

1:08:41.766 --> 1:08:44.402
with an honorable discharge
due to injury.

1:08:45.103 --> 1:08:49.207
Became a police officer,
rising to the rank of detective

1:08:49.675 --> 1:08:52.444
until held accountable
for the death of his partner,

1:08:53.244 --> 1:08:54.479
Henry Franklin.

1:08:57.448 --> 1:09:00.418
Left the police
after a lengthy investigation

1:09:00.519 --> 1:09:03.088
that would've likely resulted
in criminal charges.

1:09:03.921 --> 1:09:07.658
Current status,
freelance investigator.

1:09:07.826 --> 1:09:10.729
Congratulations.
You can access my file.

1:09:13.430 --> 1:09:14.665
Personal records...

1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:19.003
Married once
to Katherine m. Grant

1:09:20.005 --> 1:09:23.240
until Katherine Grant,
renamed Katherine Carmichael,

1:09:23.475 --> 1:09:25.176
was found dead in the residence

1:09:25.275 --> 1:09:26.979
of David
and Katherine Carmichael.

1:09:28.246 --> 1:09:29.246
Cause of death...

1:09:30.015 --> 1:09:33.685
Self-inflicted overdose
of sleeping pills.

1:09:35.353 --> 1:09:36.788
Previous to her suicide,

1:09:36.854 --> 1:09:39.857
Katherine Grant was
diagnosed as schizophrenic...

1:09:41.225 --> 1:09:46.497
But was not receiving treatment
at the time of her death.

1:09:51.569 --> 1:09:53.704
Why didn't you treat
your wife, David?

1:09:58.243 --> 1:10:00.179
Do you blame yourself
for her death?

1:10:03.948 --> 1:10:05.217
I believe you do.

1:10:11.088 --> 1:10:13.057
I see all types of people.

1:10:15.627 --> 1:10:18.764
They show me parts of themselves
they never show anyone.

1:10:21.666 --> 1:10:23.802
I know things about the meat...

1:10:25.470 --> 1:10:27.271
And you're the kind
that blames himself.

1:10:27.538 --> 1:10:30.943
You need to get the fuck out.

1:10:32.944 --> 1:10:35.480
Would you like me
to tell you what your fantasy...

1:10:35.713 --> 1:10:37.716
Your dream is, David?

1:10:37.782 --> 1:10:39.650
I want you to leave now.

1:10:40.618 --> 1:10:43.889
You fantasize about
being above it all.

1:10:44.689 --> 1:10:48.126
Above me, above this place.

1:10:53.664 --> 1:10:55.634
You're living your fantasy.

1:10:56.568 --> 1:10:57.835
Judging me...

1:10:58.935 --> 1:11:03.641
Convincing yourself that you're
not broken like the rest of us.

1:11:10.649 --> 1:11:12.150
I can look like her.

1:11:15.653 --> 1:11:17.623
I can have her red hair.

1:11:20.492 --> 1:11:21.827
Would you like that?

1:11:23.862 --> 1:11:26.765
That little fire of guilt
you carry,

1:11:26.864 --> 1:11:29.635
I can help you put it out.

1:11:32.737 --> 1:11:34.306
There's your fantasy.

1:11:35.673 --> 1:11:37.841
Being strong enough
to tell me no.

1:11:46.350 --> 1:11:50.621
Did you tell Marlon...
That I attacked that man?

1:11:51.055 --> 1:11:52.055
No.

1:11:54.259 --> 1:11:55.560
You protected me.

1:11:57.028 --> 1:11:58.963
Why?

1:11:59.363 --> 1:12:00.364
You hate me...

1:12:01.033 --> 1:12:03.035
And you hate
everything that I am.

1:12:03.734 --> 1:12:04.868
Why protect me?

1:12:05.270 --> 1:12:07.605
Because you're right.

1:12:07.971 --> 1:12:10.307
That is my dream,
protecting, okay?

1:12:10.641 --> 1:12:12.542
But now I'm awake,
and I'm outta here.

1:12:12.676 --> 1:12:14.313
I'm leaving tomorrow.

1:12:17.347 --> 1:12:18.850
You can't leave tomorrow.

1:12:20.051 --> 1:12:21.819
You told me you would
stop the person

1:12:21.886 --> 1:12:23.321
sending me those messages.

1:12:23.654 --> 1:12:25.157
He's gonna kill me, you know.

1:12:33.797 --> 1:12:35.917
You know, I actually think
maybe that's what you want.

1:12:38.869 --> 1:12:40.238
You're never gonna leave here.

1:12:41.171 --> 1:12:43.307
No one's ever gonna
purchase you and take you away,

1:12:43.375 --> 1:12:44.375
and you know that.

1:12:46.444 --> 1:12:48.313
So death may be the only answer.

1:12:53.350 --> 1:12:55.653
And they do say
it's when you feel most alive.

1:12:55.820 --> 1:12:58.323
That final moment.

1:13:02.961 --> 1:13:04.429
I didn't get treatment
for my wife

1:13:04.496 --> 1:13:05.656
'cause she didn't want me to.

1:13:06.097 --> 1:13:08.308
She knew she was gonna spend
the rest of her life broken,

1:13:08.332 --> 1:13:09.835
and she...

1:13:12.203 --> 1:13:13.639
She wanted to leave.

1:13:15.974 --> 1:13:17.009
So I let her.

1:13:22.581 --> 1:13:24.850
I bought her those pills.

1:13:31.023 --> 1:13:33.692
I... I don't understand
what you're saying.

1:13:36.828 --> 1:13:38.106
I'm saying I know
what it looks like

1:13:38.130 --> 1:13:41.298
when somebody wants to die.

1:13:56.247 --> 1:13:59.351
Thank you for your discretion
about Melissa.

1:14:01.853 --> 1:14:03.788
We buried her this morning.

1:14:06.757 --> 1:14:08.993
How did you like
your time in the zone?

1:14:10.228 --> 1:14:11.930
Uh. Not my kinda place.

1:14:15.766 --> 1:14:18.836
The gallant knight finds no home
in the city of robots.

1:14:18.936 --> 1:14:21.472
I admire that.
Most people get lost there.

1:14:23.675 --> 1:14:26.478
Well, a job well done.

1:14:29.079 --> 1:14:31.850
I'm arranging a transfer
of two million into your account

1:14:32.149 --> 1:14:33.184
as per our terms.

1:14:33.318 --> 1:14:37.422
You're not wealthy... but you're rich.

1:14:39.657 --> 1:14:41.525
About the person
who murdered your niece...

1:14:41.658 --> 1:14:42.658
Yes.

1:14:43.295 --> 1:14:47.632
You suspect royale for that
and for stalking Jane.

1:14:48.099 --> 1:14:49.600
Most rational people would.

1:14:56.740 --> 1:14:58.141
We will have justice
for Melissa,

1:14:58.242 --> 1:15:00.212
but like everything here,
it will be...

1:15:01.378 --> 1:15:02.378
Unique.

1:15:02.846 --> 1:15:04.282
Yeah, I'm sure.

1:15:06.484 --> 1:15:07.724
What can you tell me about her?

1:15:08.118 --> 1:15:09.487
What do you mean? About who?

1:15:12.323 --> 1:15:13.325
Melissa.

1:15:16.694 --> 1:15:19.464
Oh, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1:15:20.765 --> 1:15:25.069
In many ways, she was
my family's conscience.

1:15:25.970 --> 1:15:27.271
What did you love about her?

1:15:30.341 --> 1:15:31.409
I beg your pardon?

1:15:32.042 --> 1:15:33.677
What did you love about her?

1:15:34.345 --> 1:15:37.314
Let me rephrase that.
What did you hate about her?

1:15:44.889 --> 1:15:46.925
You're being cruel,
Mr. Carmichael.

1:15:47.591 --> 1:15:49.094
You never asked if she suffered.

1:15:49.827 --> 1:15:51.262
Families usually ask that.

1:15:54.498 --> 1:15:57.234
Her death was violent.
I assume she suffered.

1:15:58.435 --> 1:16:01.438
Royale's obsessions
have always been problematic.

1:16:04.175 --> 1:16:07.211
Well, royale's a sociopath.

1:16:07.310 --> 1:16:10.881
Marlon considers that a benefit.

1:16:11.682 --> 1:16:15.052
She's also a coward... like you.

1:16:16.487 --> 1:16:18.989
But royale doesn't have to live
in her brother's multi-billion

1:16:19.055 --> 1:16:20.423
pound shadow, does she?

1:16:20.925 --> 1:16:24.195
Sharing his name
and yet being a servant.

1:16:27.498 --> 1:16:29.265
My brother is a visionary.

1:16:29.600 --> 1:16:31.369
He leads, we follow.

1:16:33.037 --> 1:16:34.573
He must be some kinda god.

1:16:36.841 --> 1:16:38.543
I hope you're getting
something in return.

1:16:39.476 --> 1:16:41.676
I mean, I wouldn't wanna be
a loyal subject for nothing.

1:16:42.979 --> 1:16:44.948
You don't even get to manage
his creations, right?

1:16:45.015 --> 1:16:47.518
That's royale's
responsibility, yeah?

1:16:48.987 --> 1:16:50.989
So apart from paying
a few bills...

1:16:52.689 --> 1:16:54.024
You don't do much at all.

1:16:56.127 --> 1:16:59.263
I have a role here.
I have value.

1:16:59.497 --> 1:17:00.765
Yeah?

1:17:01.131 --> 1:17:02.299
Doesn't look like it.

1:17:04.068 --> 1:17:06.570
Jane's your brother's
favorite, right?

1:17:06.904 --> 1:17:08.106
Marlon's favorite?

1:17:09.006 --> 1:17:10.740
That's why you stalk her,
isn't it?

1:17:10.807 --> 1:17:12.911
To get to him, to hurt him.

1:17:17.148 --> 1:17:18.825
Of course, the best way
to hurt him would be

1:17:18.849 --> 1:17:20.051
to murder his daughter.

1:17:22.020 --> 1:17:25.089
And then you get to watch royale
suffer in her judgment,

1:17:25.555 --> 1:17:27.858
you get to toy with me
'cause I'm just the help...

1:17:28.158 --> 1:17:30.728
And then you get
to feel like you actually

1:17:30.828 --> 1:17:33.931
do have a... role here...

1:17:34.798 --> 1:17:36.400
That you do have value,

1:17:37.101 --> 1:17:38.470
even if you don't.

1:17:44.509 --> 1:17:45.911
I didn't kill Melissa.

1:17:47.811 --> 1:17:49.314
And yet we both know you did.

1:18:01.792 --> 1:18:03.228
I could kill you too.

1:18:06.797 --> 1:18:07.998
You could try.

1:18:23.079 --> 1:18:25.182
I want to show you something.

1:18:30.020 --> 1:18:32.090
It'd be nice
to finally show someone.

1:18:48.738 --> 1:18:51.208
I built this myself.

1:19:04.354 --> 1:19:08.058
I keep parts of them
to remember.

1:19:10.394 --> 1:19:12.430
My brother pretends
they have accidents.

1:19:12.529 --> 1:19:14.865
He doesn't like to believe
someone might be killing them.

1:19:15.699 --> 1:19:18.569
But you kill people.
You know how it feels.

1:19:20.904 --> 1:19:23.306
Marlon thinks true pleasure
lies in creation,

1:19:23.407 --> 1:19:25.743
but I... I don't.
Do you know what I think?

1:19:26.543 --> 1:19:31.448
I think god found no meaning
until he created death.

1:19:42.025 --> 1:19:43.461
Sweet Melissa.

1:19:46.896 --> 1:19:49.266
Melissa hated her last name.
She...

1:19:49.768 --> 1:19:53.270
The weight of it just...
I... I don't mind it.

1:19:53.337 --> 1:19:55.540
But she raged against her father

1:19:55.605 --> 1:19:57.608
and liked to run off
into the zone.

1:19:59.810 --> 1:20:02.246
She felt more kinship
with those things than with us.

1:20:02.313 --> 1:20:04.649
Something I'll never understand.

1:20:08.118 --> 1:20:09.554
I didn't know she was there.

1:20:11.088 --> 1:20:14.091
She found me
hurting one of them.

1:20:14.525 --> 1:20:17.228
She was gonna tell Marlon.
I couldn't let that happen.

1:20:18.395 --> 1:20:20.063
You see, it's the cardinal sin.

1:20:20.331 --> 1:20:21.865
He would never
forgive me for that.

1:20:22.565 --> 1:20:25.235
And you think he's gonna forgive
you for killing his daughter?

1:20:27.070 --> 1:20:28.506
Well, he's never going to know.

1:20:32.277 --> 1:20:33.711
Why did you hire me?

1:20:35.011 --> 1:20:37.247
Melissa's story
needed a conclusion.

1:20:38.149 --> 1:20:39.425
I couldn't be the one
to find her.

1:20:39.449 --> 1:20:42.386
The police would make an issue
of it and raid the zone.

1:20:44.588 --> 1:20:46.224
You were my solution.

1:20:48.259 --> 1:20:50.161
And poor royale...

1:20:51.496 --> 1:20:54.565
Will have to be the monster
that Marlon needs to find.

1:20:57.402 --> 1:21:01.838
Well... I think that concludes
our business, Mr. Carmichael.

1:21:01.904 --> 1:21:03.440
You do excellent work.

1:21:04.042 --> 1:21:05.276
If the need arises,

1:21:05.576 --> 1:21:08.445
I will have no hesitation
recommending you in the future.

1:21:10.113 --> 1:21:11.882
I oughta put you away
for a long time.

1:21:17.421 --> 1:21:19.157
No, I'm not going to prison.

1:21:20.023 --> 1:21:21.458
My brother won't allow it.

1:21:23.894 --> 1:21:25.130
And you have no proof.

1:21:26.730 --> 1:21:28.632
You are not a cop anymore.

1:21:32.536 --> 1:21:33.570
Besides...

1:21:34.837 --> 1:21:36.038
You wouldn't get your money,

1:21:36.939 --> 1:21:40.810
and Marlon...
Would make your life hell.

1:21:48.219 --> 1:21:50.387
So what, you're just gonna
keep terrorizing Jane?

1:21:51.154 --> 1:21:52.456
Well, for a little longer.

1:21:52.523 --> 1:21:56.293
I... I just love seeing
how human she is.

1:21:56.994 --> 1:21:59.396
And what's more human than fear?

1:22:06.270 --> 1:22:07.906
Yeah, I might kill her too.

1:22:08.905 --> 1:22:09.905
If I do...

1:22:11.809 --> 1:22:13.644
Which part of her should I keep?

1:22:14.110 --> 1:22:16.346
Perhaps her brain.

1:22:19.583 --> 1:22:20.583
You can go now.

1:22:53.850 --> 1:22:57.255
In your opinion,
zone 414 is safe.

1:23:00.123 --> 1:23:01.658
In my opinion, yes.

1:23:03.728 --> 1:23:06.697
I did not see anything
that led me to believe

1:23:06.764 --> 1:23:09.534
that there is any danger
in zone 414.

1:23:24.681 --> 1:23:27.784
<i>The veidt droid 6855...</i>

1:24:19.302 --> 1:24:20.904
Hello, Jane.

1:24:30.180 --> 1:24:31.649
You are afraid.

1:24:39.021 --> 1:24:40.024
Oh, my.

1:24:51.435 --> 1:24:53.338
Marlon doesn't know
I have one of these.

1:24:55.706 --> 1:24:57.809
There's a lot
my brother doesn't know.

1:24:58.875 --> 1:25:00.912
Just gives us
a little more time together.

1:25:04.414 --> 1:25:05.750
Keeps you still.

1:25:11.755 --> 1:25:12.755
And quiet.

1:25:15.725 --> 1:25:17.862
But I know you can hear me.

1:25:30.407 --> 1:25:32.710
And I know you can feel me.

1:25:43.787 --> 1:25:46.490
<i>Dimensional
emulation biotechnology.</i>

1:25:46.556 --> 1:25:49.493
<i>The Android model is capable...</i>

1:26:10.747 --> 1:26:12.182
Melissa liked you.

1:26:13.251 --> 1:26:15.319
She thought you were her friend.

1:26:17.220 --> 1:26:20.090
She didn't realize
you can't be anyone's friend

1:26:20.557 --> 1:26:21.893
because you're a lie.

1:26:23.060 --> 1:26:24.662
You're my brother's lie.

1:27:13.377 --> 1:27:14.579
Hmm.

1:27:16.212 --> 1:27:17.914
My brother didn't miss a detail.

1:27:19.315 --> 1:27:20.952
Not with you.

1:27:24.287 --> 1:27:25.555
I feel pain.

1:27:29.059 --> 1:27:30.193
I feel love.

1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:31.896
I loved Melissa.

1:27:32.697 --> 1:27:35.833
I feel hate, and I hate you!

1:27:41.438 --> 1:27:42.873
I'm alive.

1:27:47.377 --> 1:27:48.746
I'm alive!

1:27:53.984 --> 1:27:56.185
I'm alive!

1:27:58.521 --> 1:28:00.224
No!

1:28:28.118 --> 1:28:29.152
Jane.

1:28:32.789 --> 1:28:33.789
Jane?

1:28:42.832 --> 1:28:45.135
You have a job to do, so do it.

1:28:45.635 --> 1:28:47.003
I won't stop you.

1:28:48.137 --> 1:28:49.140
What do you mean?

1:28:51.207 --> 1:28:54.344
It's okay. I don't wanna
live like this anymore.

1:28:54.778 --> 1:28:56.113
You can set me free.

1:29:06.157 --> 1:29:07.324
You really wanna be free?

1:29:08.390 --> 1:29:09.390
Yes.

1:29:17.967 --> 1:29:20.436
He's Marlon's brother.

1:29:21.037 --> 1:29:25.175
Yeah, and he killed
Marlon's daughter, your friend.

1:29:28.177 --> 1:29:31.748
It's my gun, Jane,
and you don't have fingerprints.

1:29:31.916 --> 1:29:33.382
It's gonna look like I did it.

1:29:34.384 --> 1:29:36.921
The only thing that matters is
if you can live with yourself.

1:29:39.122 --> 1:29:42.993
Please, please.

1:30:12.256 --> 1:30:13.324
Why did you come back?

1:30:23.501 --> 1:30:25.970
'Cause I never should have
bought my wife those pills.

1:30:31.975 --> 1:30:33.944
They'll destroy us both now.

1:30:50.560 --> 1:30:51.661
In my investigation,

1:30:51.761 --> 1:30:54.063
I was unable to locate
Melissa veidt,

1:30:54.663 --> 1:30:56.099
despite my complete efforts.

1:30:58.435 --> 1:31:01.405
<i>And yet, upon returning
to the veidt estate...</i>

1:31:02.939 --> 1:31:07.110
<i>I found Melissa there
with her father, Marlon veidt,</i>

1:31:07.377 --> 1:31:08.746
<i>and her uncle Joseph.</i>

1:31:09.779 --> 1:31:11.448
We have a deal, Mr. Veidt.

1:31:13.650 --> 1:31:16.119
And I will honor it, David.

1:31:19.088 --> 1:31:21.725
<i>So Marlon's daughter is alive.</i>

1:31:23.827 --> 1:31:25.195
As I understand it.

1:31:32.802 --> 1:31:34.805
A parent's not meant
to Bury their children.

1:31:35.271 --> 1:31:36.271
No.

1:31:38.240 --> 1:31:41.377
I would like
to never see you again.

1:31:49.953 --> 1:31:50.953
Hmm.

1:31:59.529 --> 1:32:00.898
Thank you, father.

1:32:02.631 --> 1:32:05.935
You're welcome, sweetheart.

1:32:07.404 --> 1:32:10.007
State your name for the record.

1:32:11.541 --> 1:32:12.877
David Carmichael.

1:32:14.010 --> 1:32:15.846
That should be sufficient.

1:32:16.646 --> 1:32:18.414
End the recording.

1:32:21.452 --> 1:32:24.155
Any attempt to refute
any element of this story

1:32:24.255 --> 1:32:27.391
will be met with every legal
resistance, Mr. Carmichael.

1:32:28.824 --> 1:32:30.793
Even if you engage
in legal action,

1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:32.695
realize it will be your word

1:32:32.895 --> 1:32:34.831
against the word
of Marlon veidt.

1:32:35.798 --> 1:32:38.068
Yeah, sure.

1:32:41.104 --> 1:32:43.272
<i>Warning, gate opening.</i>

1:32:43.739 --> 1:32:45.742
<i>Warning, gate opening.</i>

1:32:46.042 --> 1:32:48.479
<i>Warning, gate opening.</i>
