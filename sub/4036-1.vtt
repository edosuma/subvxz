03:13.100 --> 03:15.490
You never did eat your lunch,
did you?

03:15.577 --> 03:18.706
I better get back to the office.
These extended lunch hours...

03:18.793 --> 03:20.705
give my boss excess acid.

03:20.792 --> 03:22.661
Why don't you call your boss
and tell him...

03:22.747 --> 03:24.964
you're taking the rest
of the afternoon off?

03:25.050 --> 03:27.441
It's Friday anyway,
and hot.

03:27.571 --> 03:32.351
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

03:32.439 --> 03:34.916
Well, we could laze
around here a while longer.

03:35.002 --> 03:38.870
Checking-out time is 3:00 p. m.

03:38.957 --> 03:42.347
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in you when you come in...

03:42.433 --> 03:44.824
but when your time is up...

03:44.911 --> 03:47.648
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

03:47.735 --> 03:49.648
I've heard of married couples who
deliberately spend a night...

03:49.734 --> 03:51.473
in a cheap hotel.

03:51.559 --> 03:55.471
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

03:55.601 --> 03:58.208
You sure talk like
a girl who's been married.

03:58.295 --> 04:01.337
Oh, Sam, this is
the last time.

04:01.424 --> 04:04.944
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.

04:05.074 --> 04:08.725
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

04:08.812 --> 04:11.593
You come down here
on business trips...

04:11.680 --> 04:13.983
and we steal lunch hours.

04:14.070 --> 04:17.112
I wish you
wouldn't even come.

04:17.199 --> 04:20.805
What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

04:20.892 --> 04:23.109
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

04:25.369 --> 04:28.541
- I can come down next week.
- No.

04:28.629 --> 04:33.713
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch in public?

04:33.800 --> 04:37.972
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

04:38.058 --> 04:39.971
But respectably.

04:40.057 --> 04:42.882
In my house with my mother's
picture on the mantel and...

04:42.969 --> 04:46.663
my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three.

04:46.793 --> 04:49.053
And after the steak, do we
send sister to the movies...

04:49.140 --> 04:51.052
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

04:51.139 --> 04:53.181
Sam!

04:55.397 --> 04:57.527
All right.

05:03.133 --> 05:06.218
Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.825
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

05:10.912 --> 05:14.215
You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

05:14.301 --> 05:19.604
I'm all for it. It requires patience,
temperance, a lot of sweating out.

05:19.690 --> 05:23.949
Otherwise, though,
it's just hard work.

05:24.036 --> 05:29.077
But if I can see you and touch you
even as simply as this, I won't mind it.

05:31.424 --> 05:33.857
I'm tired of sweating
for people who aren't there.

05:33.945 --> 05:36.855
I sweat to pay off my father's
debts, and he's in his grave.

05:36.943 --> 05:39.898
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,
and she's living...

05:39.984 --> 05:41.593
on the other side of the world somewhere.

05:42.679 --> 05:44.505
I pay too.

05:46.156 --> 05:48.676
They also pay
who meet in hotel rooms.

05:50.414 --> 05:54.064
A couple of years and
my debts will be paid off.

05:54.152 --> 05:56.238
If she ever remarries,
the alimony stops.

05:56.325 --> 06:00.931
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- But when you do, you'll swing.

06:01.018 --> 06:03.973
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

06:07.841 --> 06:12.707
And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

06:12.795 --> 06:15.315
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.

06:15.445 --> 06:19.053
When I send my ex-wife her alimony,
you can lick the stamps.

06:19.139 --> 06:21.877
I'll lick the stamps.

06:29.134 --> 06:34.437
You want to cut this off, go out
and find yourself somebody available?

06:34.523 --> 06:36.914
I'm thinking of it.

06:40.043 --> 06:43.475
How could you even
think a thing like that?

06:43.563 --> 06:46.300
- Don't miss your plane.
- We can leave together, can't we?

06:46.387 --> 06:50.212
Mm-mm. I'm late and, uh,
you have to put your shoes on.

07:03.074 --> 07:05.508
Isn't Mr Lowery
back from lunch?

07:05.595 --> 07:08.506
He's lunching with the man who's
buying the Harris Street property.

07:08.594 --> 07:12.026
The old lease man. That's why
he's late. You got a headache?

07:12.114 --> 07:15.025
It'll pass.
Headaches are like resolutions...

07:15.112 --> 07:17.632
you forget them
as soon as they stop hurting.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.631
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.

07:20.718 --> 07:23.543
My mother's doctor gave them to me
the day of my wedding.

07:23.629 --> 07:26.672
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquillizers.

07:26.758 --> 07:28.844
Any calls?

07:28.932 --> 07:33.234
Teddy called me. My mother
called to see if Teddy called.

07:33.321 --> 07:36.580
Oh, your sister called to say she's
going to Tucson to do some buying...

07:36.666 --> 07:38.927
- and she'll be gone the whole weekend...

07:41.925 --> 07:46.662
Wow. It's as hot
as fresh milk.

07:46.749 --> 07:51.398
Hey, you girls oughta get your boss
to air condition ya up.

07:51.486 --> 07:53.572
He can afford it today.

07:53.658 --> 07:56.701
Marion, will you get the copies
of that deed ready for Mr Cassidy?

07:56.787 --> 08:00.698
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow's the day, my sweet little girl.

08:00.829 --> 08:04.132
Oh... Oh, not you.
My daughter.

08:04.219 --> 08:06.565
A baby.

08:06.652 --> 08:11.519
Tomorrow she stands her sweet self
up there and gets married away from me.

08:11.606 --> 08:16.473
- I want you to take a look at my baby.

08:18.038 --> 08:19.950
Eighteen years old...

08:20.037 --> 08:24.687
and she never had an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

08:24.817 --> 08:27.902
Come on, Tom.
My office is air conditioned.

08:27.990 --> 08:30.510
Do you know what I do
about unhappiness?

08:30.597 --> 08:33.116
I buy it off.

08:33.205 --> 08:35.594
Are, uh...
Are you unhappy?

08:35.682 --> 08:38.635
Uh, not inordinately.

08:40.852 --> 08:45.242
I'm buying this house
for my baby's wedding present.

08:45.329 --> 08:47.937
Forty thousand
dollars cash.

08:49.501 --> 08:51.891
Now that's...
that's not buying happiness.

08:51.978 --> 08:55.411
That's just buying off unhappiness.

08:57.193 --> 09:00.713
I never carry more than
I can afford to lose.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.146
- Count 'em!
- I declare!

09:03.233 --> 09:06.753
I don't. That's how
I get to keep it.

09:06.840 --> 09:11.012
Tom, a cash transaction
of this size is most irregular.

09:11.099 --> 09:13.793
Ah, so what?
It's my private money.

09:13.837 --> 09:17.096
- Now it's yours.
- Suppose we put it in the safe...

09:17.182 --> 09:20.572
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

09:20.660 --> 09:25.700
Oh, speaking of feeling good, where's
that bottle you said was in your desk?

09:25.787 --> 09:29.742
Uh-oh.

09:29.828 --> 09:34.435
You know, uh, sometimes
I can keep my mouth shut.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.866
Lowery, I am dying
of "thirst-aroonie. "

09:45.430 --> 09:48.211
I don't even want it in
the office over the weekend.

09:48.255 --> 09:53.209
Put it in the safe deposit box in the
bank, and we'll get a cheque on Monday.

09:53.295 --> 09:55.816
Yes.

09:59.727 --> 10:04.290
He was flirting with you. I guess
he must've noticed my wedding ring.

10:17.588 --> 10:19.544
Come in.

10:21.499 --> 10:25.324
The copies. If you don't mind,
I'd like to go home after the bank.

10:25.410 --> 10:27.713
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.

10:27.844 --> 10:30.756
Because me and your boss are goin' out
and get ourselves...

10:30.842 --> 10:32.755
a little drinkin' done, right?

10:32.841 --> 10:35.579
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.

10:35.666 --> 10:40.229
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas,
the playground of the world.

10:40.359 --> 10:42.576
I'm going to spend this weekend
in bed. Thank you.

10:45.313 --> 10:49.790
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.

10:49.876 --> 10:53.266
Can't buy off unhappiness
with pills.

10:53.354 --> 10:58.220
I guess I'll go put this money in the
bank and then go home and sleep it off.

13:00.465 --> 13:03.767
Marion, what in
the world... What are you doing up here?

13:03.855 --> 13:06.593
Of course I'm glad to see you.
I always am.

13:06.679 --> 13:10.590
What is it, Marion?

14:46.848 --> 14:49.803
- Uh, hold it there.

14:54.974 --> 14:57.408
In quite a hurry.

14:57.495 --> 15:02.970
I didn't intend to sleep so long. I
almost had an accident from sleepiness.

15:03.057 --> 15:06.707
- So, I decided to pull over.
- You slept here all night?

15:06.795 --> 15:10.662
Yes. As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

15:10.749 --> 15:14.182
There are plenty of motels
in this area. You should've...

15:14.269 --> 15:16.442
I mean, just to be safe.

15:16.529 --> 15:19.441
I didn't intend to sleep all night.
I just pulled over.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.527
Have I broken any laws?

15:21.613 --> 15:23.830
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?

15:25.264 --> 15:28.045
Is anything wrong?

15:28.132 --> 15:31.782
Of course not. Am I acting
as if there's something wrong?

15:31.869 --> 15:36.823
- Frankly, yes.
- Please, I'd like to go.

15:36.911 --> 15:39.605
- Well, is there?
- Is there what?

15:42.559 --> 15:44.819
I've told you there's nothing wrong,
except I'm in a hurry...

15:44.950 --> 15:46.819
and you're taking up my time.

15:46.949 --> 15:48.817
- Now, just a moment.

15:48.905 --> 15:52.425
- Turn your motor off, please.

15:52.511 --> 15:55.379
May I see your licence?

15:58.117 --> 16:01.029
- Why?
- Please.

18:06.576 --> 18:09.227
Be with you
in a second!

19:12.675 --> 19:14.934
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?

19:15.021 --> 19:18.063
There's an old saying: "First customer
of the day is always the most trouble. "

19:18.150 --> 19:20.062
But I'm in no mood for it...

19:20.148 --> 19:22.626
so I'm gonna treat you so fair
you won't have one reason...

19:22.713 --> 19:26.276
- Can I trade my car and take another?
- Do anything you have a mind to.

19:26.364 --> 19:29.274
Bein' a woman, you will.
That yours?

19:29.362 --> 19:32.100
Yes, it's, it's... There's
nothing wrong with it. I just...

19:32.186 --> 19:34.098
Sick of the sight of it.

19:34.186 --> 19:37.706
Have a look around and see if there's
something that strikes your eyes...

19:37.792 --> 19:40.053
and I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

19:40.139 --> 19:41.920
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you. I'm in a hurry...

19:42.008 --> 19:43.746
and just wanna make a change.

19:43.833 --> 19:46.614
One thing people never oughta be
when they're buyin' used cars...

19:46.701 --> 19:49.570
and that's in a hurry, but like I said,
it's too nice a day to argue.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.350
I'll shoot your car
in the garage here.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.253
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.990
- How much?
- Go ahead.

20:17.078 --> 20:18.729
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.

20:18.815 --> 20:20.728
How much would it be
with my car?

20:20.815 --> 20:23.988
You mean you don't want the usual day
and a half to think it over?

20:24.074 --> 20:28.463
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasin' ya?

20:28.551 --> 20:30.462
Of course not.
Please.

20:30.549 --> 20:36.416
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high pressured the salesman.

20:36.503 --> 20:40.979
Ah, I figure roughly...

20:41.109 --> 20:44.065
your car plus $700.

20:44.151 --> 20:48.540
- Seven hundred.
- You always got time to argue money.

20:48.628 --> 20:50.670
All right.

20:54.798 --> 20:57.754
I take it you can prove
that car is yours.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.013
I mean, out-of-state licence.
You got your pink slip...

21:01.099 --> 21:04.315
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies room?

21:04.403 --> 21:07.183
In the building.

21:17.657 --> 21:19.829
Over there.

22:16.193 --> 22:18.844
I think you better take it
for a trial spin.

22:18.931 --> 22:21.625
I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.

22:21.713 --> 22:24.624
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this...

22:24.711 --> 22:29.013
I might as well be perfectly honest with
you. It's not that I don't trust you...

22:29.100 --> 22:32.533
But what? Is there
anything so terribly wrong...

22:32.620 --> 22:35.141
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

22:35.227 --> 22:38.530
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.

22:38.617 --> 22:42.137
All right,
let's go inside.

23:18.424 --> 23:20.336
Hey!

23:26.985 --> 23:29.983
Just put it in here, please.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.329
Thank you.

23:41.847 --> 23:44.759
<i>Heck,
Officer, that was the first time...</i>

23:44.845 --> 23:47.627
<i>I saw the customer
high pressure the salesman.</i>

23:47.714 --> 23:49.625
<i>Somebody chasin' her?</i>

23:49.713 --> 23:52.624
<i>I better have
a look at those papers, Charlie.</i>

23:52.712 --> 23:56.926
<i>- She look like a wrong one to you?
- Acted like one.</i>

23:57.014 --> 24:01.186
<i>The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.</i>

24:09.181 --> 24:11.441
<i>Yes, Mr Lowery.</i>

24:11.528 --> 24:13.788
<i>Caroline. Marion still isn't in?</i>

24:13.918 --> 24:17.569
<i>No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.</i>

24:17.655 --> 24:21.089
<i>Buzz me the minute
she comes in.</i>

24:21.219 --> 24:24.478
<i>And call her sister.
No one's answering at the house.</i>

24:24.565 --> 24:28.955
<i>I called her sister where she works...
The Music Makers Music Store...</i>

24:29.041 --> 24:31.779
<i>and she doesn't know where Marion
is any more than we do.</i>

24:31.866 --> 24:35.646
<i>You better run out to the house. She may
be, well, unable to answer the phone.</i>

24:35.734 --> 24:38.993
<i>Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.</i>

24:42.383 --> 24:45.077
<i>No, I haven't the faintest idea.</i>

24:45.207 --> 24:48.162
<i>As I said, I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.</i>

24:48.250 --> 24:51.812
<i>She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and I said she could.</i>

24:51.900 --> 24:54.594
<i>That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.</i>

24:54.681 --> 24:57.984
<i>I did see her
some time later driving...</i>

24:58.070 --> 25:02.156
<i>Uh, I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.</i>

25:02.242 --> 25:05.154
<i>Caroline,
get Mr Cassidy for me.</i>

25:07.240 --> 25:11.412
<i>After all, Cassidy,
I told you, all that cash!</i>

25:11.498 --> 25:13.845
<i>I'm not taking
the responsibility.</i>

25:13.933 --> 25:18.408
<i>Oh, for heaven's sake. A girl works
for you for ten years, you trust her.</i>

25:18.496 --> 25:20.407
<i>All right, yes,
you better come over.</i>

25:22.493 --> 25:26.013
<i>Well, I ain't
about to kiss off $40,000!</i>

25:26.100 --> 25:28.143
<i>I'll get it back, and if any of it's
missin', I'll replace it...</i>

25:28.230 --> 25:30.141
<i>with her fine, soft flesh!</i>

25:30.229 --> 25:33.184
<i>- I'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.</i>

25:33.270 --> 25:38.485
<i>I still can't believe... It must be
some kind of a mystery. I, I can't...</i>

25:38.573 --> 25:41.832
<i>You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?</i>

25:41.919 --> 25:46.047
<i>You still trustin'? Hot creepers!
She sat there while I dumped it out!</i>

25:46.134 --> 25:50.870
<i>Hardly even looked at it. Plannin'.
And, and even flirtin' with me!</i>

28:15.887 --> 28:21.058
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you
in all this rain. Go ahead in, please.

28:25.969 --> 28:28.533
- Dirty night.
- Do you have a vacancy?

28:28.619 --> 28:32.879
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
12 cabins, 12 vacancies.

28:32.965 --> 28:36.269
They, uh... They moved
away the highway.

28:36.355 --> 28:40.180
Oh, I thought I'd gotten
off the main road.

28:40.266 --> 28:45.437
I knew you must have. Nobody ever stops
here any more unless they've done that.

28:45.525 --> 28:49.436
But... there's no sense
dwelling on our losses.

28:49.523 --> 28:53.738
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

28:57.171 --> 29:01.126
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

29:03.863 --> 29:06.775
Los Angeles.

29:12.903 --> 29:17.639
Cabin one. It's closer in case you want
anything. It's right next to the office.

29:17.727 --> 29:20.551
I want sleep more than anything else,
except maybe food.

29:20.637 --> 29:24.027
There's a big diner about ten miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

29:24.115 --> 29:28.808
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

29:47.885 --> 29:50.189
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

29:55.621 --> 29:58.533
Well, the, uh, mattress
is soft and...

29:58.619 --> 30:00.879
there's hangers in the closet
and stationary...

30:00.966 --> 30:02.878
with "Bates Motel"
printed on it...

30:02.965 --> 30:06.658
in case you wanna make your
friends back home feel envious.

30:06.746 --> 30:08.702
And the, uh...

30:10.092 --> 30:12.786
- Over there.
- The bathroom.

30:12.873 --> 30:15.220
Yeah.

30:15.307 --> 30:19.609
Well, uh, i-i-if you want anything,
just... just tap on the wall.

30:19.696 --> 30:21.608
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr Bates.

30:21.695 --> 30:24.172
Norman Bates.

30:26.649 --> 30:30.082
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

30:30.169 --> 30:32.560
- No.
- Then would you do me a favour?

30:32.646 --> 30:34.385
Would you have dinner with me?

30:34.471 --> 30:38.948
I was just about to myself. Nothing
special... just sandwiches and milk.

30:39.034 --> 30:42.728
But I'd like it very much
if you'd come up to the house.

30:42.859 --> 30:46.205
I don't set a fancy table,
but the kitchen's awful homey.

30:47.986 --> 30:49.942
- I'd like to.
- All right.

30:50.029 --> 30:52.723
You get yourself settled and,
and take off your wet shoes.

30:52.810 --> 30:56.243
- I'll be back as soon as it's ready.
- Okay.

30:56.374 --> 30:59.937
- With my... With my trusty umbrella.

32:19.811 --> 32:22.896
No! I tell you no!

32:22.984 --> 32:25.982
I won't have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper!

32:26.113 --> 32:29.936
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion...

32:30.024 --> 32:33.630
- of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
- Mother, please.

32:33.717 --> 32:37.064
And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?

32:37.150 --> 32:40.279
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

32:40.366 --> 32:45.841
"Mother, she's just a stranger. " As if
men don't desire strangers. As if...

32:45.929 --> 32:50.492
Oh! I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

32:50.579 --> 32:52.795
Do you understand, boy?
Go on.

32:52.882 --> 32:55.924
Go tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite...

32:56.010 --> 32:58.662
with my food or my son!

32:58.748 --> 33:01.704
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

33:01.791 --> 33:06.310
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
- Shut up! Shut up!

33:47.637 --> 33:51.636
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No, uh...

33:51.723 --> 33:54.635
Mother...
My mother, uh...

33:54.721 --> 33:57.372
What is the phrase?

33:57.459 --> 34:00.674
She isn't quite
herself today.

34:00.762 --> 34:06.020
You shouldn't have bothered. I really
don't have that much of an appetite.

34:06.107 --> 34:08.757
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:10.496 --> 34:14.190
I wish you could apologize
for other people.

34:14.277 --> 34:16.188
Don't worry about it.

34:16.275 --> 34:20.187
But as long as you've fixed
the supper, we may as well eat it.

34:29.268 --> 34:34.527
It, uh... It might be, uh, nicer
and warmer in the office.

34:48.087 --> 34:50.259
Well, it stopped
raining.

34:50.346 --> 34:54.301
Uh, eating in an office
is just... just too officious.

34:54.387 --> 34:57.343
- I have the parlour back here.
- All right.

35:12.162 --> 35:15.725
- Sit down.
- Oh, thank you.

35:18.636 --> 35:21.939
You're very kind.

35:22.026 --> 35:25.764
It's all for you.
I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

35:31.152 --> 35:33.456
You... You eat like a bird.

35:35.063 --> 35:38.019
And you'd know,
of course.

35:38.105 --> 35:40.017
No, not really.

35:40.148 --> 35:43.581
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"...

35:43.668 --> 35:48.144
is really a fal...
false... falsity.

35:48.231 --> 35:51.881
Because birds really
eat a tremendous lot.

35:53.967 --> 35:58.791
But I really don't know anything about
birds. My hobby is stuffing things.

35:58.878 --> 36:00.790
You know, taxidermy.

36:00.877 --> 36:05.397
And I guess I'd just rather
stuff birds because...

36:05.483 --> 36:07.874
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.960
You know,
foxes and chimps.

36:10.046 --> 36:14.174
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.

36:14.262 --> 36:17.608
I think only birds
look well stuffed because...

36:17.738 --> 36:21.389
Well, because they're kind
of passive to begin with.

36:21.475 --> 36:24.343
It's a strange hobby.
Curious.

36:24.431 --> 36:27.951
- Uncommon too.
- Oh, I imagine so.

36:28.081 --> 36:31.818
And it's... it's not as expensive
as you'd think. It's cheap, really.

36:31.905 --> 36:34.600
You know, needles
and thread, sawdust.

36:34.686 --> 36:37.163
The chemicals are the only
thing that, that cost anything.

36:37.250 --> 36:40.206
A man should have a hobby.

36:40.292 --> 36:44.204
Well, it's...
it's more than a hobby.

36:46.333 --> 36:49.549
A hobby's supposed to
pass the time, not fill it.

36:49.635 --> 36:52.547
Is your time so empty?

36:52.634 --> 36:55.241
No. Uh...

36:55.329 --> 36:57.458
Well, I run the office...

36:57.545 --> 36:59.892
and tend the cabins
and grounds...

36:59.978 --> 37:02.803
and do little, uh,
errands for my mother...

37:02.890 --> 37:05.671
the ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

37:05.759 --> 37:08.887
Do you go out with friends?

37:10.843 --> 37:13.754
Well, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

37:16.188 --> 37:20.707
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

37:22.880 --> 37:27.531
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?

37:27.617 --> 37:30.094
I didn't mean to pry.

37:30.181 --> 37:32.876
I'm looking for
a private island.

37:35.004 --> 37:37.873
What are you
running away from?

37:39.785 --> 37:43.739
- Why do you ask that?
- No.

37:43.827 --> 37:46.216
People never run away
from anything.

37:49.042 --> 37:52.996
The rain didn't last long,
did it? You know what I think?

37:53.083 --> 37:55.647
I think that...

37:57.516 --> 37:59.645
we're all in
our private traps...

38:01.253 --> 38:05.034
clamped in them, and none of us
can ever get out.

38:06.859 --> 38:09.031
We scratch and...
and claw...

38:09.119 --> 38:13.030
but only at the air,
only at each other.

38:13.117 --> 38:17.984
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

38:18.071 --> 38:20.548
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

38:23.763 --> 38:26.154
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it any more.

38:26.240 --> 38:29.630
Oh, but you should.
You should mind it.

38:29.717 --> 38:32.151
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

38:35.193 --> 38:39.408
You know, if anyone ever talked
to me the way I heard...

38:39.495 --> 38:43.146
the way she spoke to you...

38:43.232 --> 38:47.230
Sometimes when she talks
to me like that...

38:47.318 --> 38:51.706
I feel I'd like to go up there and
curse her and, and leave her forever.

38:51.793 --> 38:54.183
Or at least defy her.

38:58.963 --> 39:03.049
But I know I can't.
She's ill.

39:03.135 --> 39:07.177
She sounded strong.

39:07.264 --> 39:09.784
No, I mean... ill.

39:11.392 --> 39:15.129
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

39:15.217 --> 39:18.910
I was only five and it,
it must've been quite a strain for her.

39:18.998 --> 39:22.865
I mean, she didn't have to go to work or
anything. He left her a little money.

39:22.952 --> 39:27.558
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

39:27.645 --> 39:31.078
And he... he talked her
into building this motel.

39:31.165 --> 39:34.164
He could have talked her
into anything.

39:34.251 --> 39:38.335
And when he died too, it was
just too great a shock for her.

39:39.769 --> 39:41.769
And the way
he died...

39:43.377 --> 39:48.201
I guess it's nothing
to talk about while you're eating.

39:48.287 --> 39:52.894
Anyway, it was just too great
a loss for her. She had nothing left.

39:52.937 --> 39:55.327
Except you.

39:55.414 --> 39:58.673
Well, a son is a poor substitute
for a lover.

40:00.759 --> 40:03.194
Why don't you go away?

40:03.280 --> 40:05.453
To a private island,
like you?

40:08.799 --> 40:12.406
No... not like me.

40:12.450 --> 40:16.622
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after her?

40:16.708 --> 40:19.576
She'd be alone up there.

40:21.402 --> 40:23.748
The fire would go out.

40:23.879 --> 40:27.659
It'd be cold and damp
like a grave.

40:27.790 --> 40:32.136
If you love someone, you don't do that
to them, even if you hate them.

40:34.048 --> 40:38.306
You understand, I...
I don't hate her.

40:38.394 --> 40:42.478
I hate what she's become.
I hate the illness.

40:44.738 --> 40:49.692
Wouldn't it be better
if you put her... some place?

40:53.951 --> 40:57.254
You mean an institution?
A madhouse?

40:59.644 --> 41:04.598
People always call
a madhouse "some place," don't they?

41:04.685 --> 41:06.640
Put her in "some place. "

41:08.422 --> 41:11.290
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to sound uncaring.

41:11.378 --> 41:13.767
What do you know
about caring?

41:13.897 --> 41:17.026
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

41:17.114 --> 41:20.851
The laughing and the tears...

41:20.937 --> 41:23.284
and the cruel eyes
studying you.

41:23.372 --> 41:25.327
My mother there?

41:27.413 --> 41:30.412
But she's harmless.

41:31.976 --> 41:34.887
She's as harmless as one
of those stuffed birds.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.755
I am sorry.

41:38.886 --> 41:43.014
I only felt...
It seems she's hurting you.

41:44.622 --> 41:48.706
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.

41:48.794 --> 41:52.401
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads and suggest...

41:52.487 --> 41:54.530
oh, so very delicately...

42:01.135 --> 42:05.351
Of course,
I've suggested it myself.

42:05.438 --> 42:09.870
But I hate to even think about it.
She needs me.

42:14.477 --> 42:19.170
It... It's not as if she were
a... a maniac, a raving thing.

42:19.257 --> 42:21.778
She...

42:21.864 --> 42:24.950
She just goes
a little mad sometimes.

42:27.123 --> 42:30.382
We all go a little mad
sometimes.

42:31.816 --> 42:34.467
Haven't you?

42:36.510 --> 42:38.639
Yes.

42:38.726 --> 42:43.984
Sometimes just one time
can be enough. Thank you.

42:45.201 --> 42:47.156
Thank you, "Norman. "

42:47.243 --> 42:50.025
Norman.

42:50.111 --> 42:53.545
Oh, you're not... you're not
going back to your room already?

42:53.631 --> 42:56.369
I'm very tired.

42:56.457 --> 42:59.498
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

42:59.586 --> 43:01.367
Really?

43:01.453 --> 43:04.800
I stepped into a private trap
back there...

43:04.887 --> 43:09.450
and I'd like to go back and try
to pull myself out of it...

43:11.101 --> 43:13.535
bef ore it's too late
for me too.

43:13.622 --> 43:17.011
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to stay a little while longer?

43:17.098 --> 43:20.792
- I mean, just for talk.
- Oh, I'd like to, but...

43:20.879 --> 43:23.269
All right. Well,
I'll see you in the morning.

43:23.356 --> 43:25.269
I'll bring you some breakfast,
all right?

43:25.355 --> 43:28.398
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.

43:28.484 --> 43:30.700
All right, Miss, uh...

43:30.787 --> 43:32.786
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.

43:32.873 --> 43:35.046
Good night.

47:42.056 --> 47:45.445
Ow! No!

47:45.532 --> 47:47.879
No! Aaah!

49:50.167 --> 49:52.471
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

49:52.557 --> 49:56.121
Blood! Blood!

01:00:21.814 --> 01:00:24.205
I've tried many brands.

01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:28.072
So far, of those I've used, I haven't
had much luck with any of them.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.071
Let's see what they say
about this one.

01:00:31.158 --> 01:00:33.548
They tell you
what its ingredients are...

01:00:33.678 --> 01:00:37.589
and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world...

01:00:37.677 --> 01:00:40.501
but they do not tell you
whether it's painless.

01:00:40.588 --> 01:00:44.412
And I say, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

01:00:44.499 --> 01:00:48.410
This one seems to claim more and better
qualities than lots of the others.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.187
Sam?

01:01:02.273 --> 01:01:05.272
Sam!
Lady wants to see ya.

01:01:11.225 --> 01:01:13.790
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

01:01:13.876 --> 01:01:16.570
- Oh, sure. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

01:01:18.353 --> 01:01:20.960
- Well, of course not. Something wrong?
- Thank you.

01:01:24.871 --> 01:01:26.957
- She left home on Friday.

01:01:27.044 --> 01:01:30.520
I was in Tucson over the weekend
and I haven't heard from her since.

01:01:30.607 --> 01:01:33.084
Not even
a phone call.

01:01:33.171 --> 01:01:36.605
If you two are in this together,
it's none of my business...

01:01:36.691 --> 01:01:39.820
but I want Marion to tell me it's none
of my business and then I'll go...

01:01:39.907 --> 01:01:43.427
Bob, run out and get yourself
some lunch, will ya?

01:01:43.557 --> 01:01:46.555
- That's okay. I brought it with me.
- Run out and eat it.

01:01:51.423 --> 01:01:55.508
Now, what thing
could we be in together?

01:01:55.595 --> 01:01:57.681
Sorry about the tears.

01:01:57.767 --> 01:02:01.027
Well, is Marion in trouble?
What is it?

01:02:01.114 --> 01:02:04.025
Let's all talk about
Marion, shall we?

01:02:07.633 --> 01:02:09.545
Who are you,
friend?

01:02:09.631 --> 01:02:11.891
My name is Arbogast,
friend.

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:14.803
I'm a private
investigator.

01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:18.540
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

01:02:18.627 --> 01:02:22.625
I know you don't, because if you did
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

01:02:22.712 --> 01:02:25.103
What's your interest
in this?

01:02:25.233 --> 01:02:28.318
Well, $40,000.

01:02:29.666 --> 01:02:31.577
- $40,000?
- That's right.

01:02:34.967 --> 01:02:38.834
One of you'd better tell me what's going
on, and fast. I can take so much...

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.834
Now, take it easy,
friend.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.701
It's just that your girlfriend
stole $40,000.

01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:47.178
What are you talking about?
What is this?

01:02:47.266 --> 01:02:51.741
She was supposed to bank it on Friday
for her boss, and she didn't.

01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:55.044
- No one has seen her since.
- Someone has seen her.

01:02:55.131 --> 01:02:57.608
Someone always sees a girl
with $40,000.

01:02:57.695 --> 01:03:01.085
They don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

01:03:01.171 --> 01:03:04.083
- Sam, if she's here...
- She isn't. She isn't.

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:07.907
Miss Crane, can I ask you, did you come
up here on a hunch and nothing more?

01:03:08.037 --> 01:03:10.949
Oh, not even a hunch.
Just hope.

01:03:11.036 --> 01:03:14.730
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

01:03:14.817 --> 01:03:17.729
I don't care
if you believe me or not.

01:03:17.815 --> 01:03:20.944
All I want to do is see Marion
bef ore she gets in this too deeply.

01:03:21.032 --> 01:03:23.943
Did you check Phoenix?
Maybe she had an accident, or a hold-up.

01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:29.157
No, she was seen leaving town in her
own car... by her employer, I might add.

01:03:29.245 --> 01:03:31.809
I can't believe it.
Can you?

01:03:33.373 --> 01:03:35.806
We're always quickest
to doubt people...

01:03:35.894 --> 01:03:38.327
who have a reputation
for being honest.

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:40.674
I think she's here,
Miss Crane.

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.195
Where there's
a boyfriend...

01:03:43.281 --> 01:03:48.192
She's not back there with the nuts and
bolts, but she's in this town somewhere.

01:03:48.279 --> 01:03:51.190
I'll find her.
I'll be seeing you.

01:04:27.999 --> 01:04:29.910
- Evening.
- Evening.

01:04:29.998 --> 01:04:31.910
I almost drove
right past.

01:04:31.996 --> 01:04:35.256
I'm always forgetting to turn
the sign on, but we do have a vacancy.

01:04:35.343 --> 01:04:38.211
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.

01:04:38.298 --> 01:04:40.210
- Candy?
- No, thanks.

01:04:40.297 --> 01:04:44.208
Last two days I've been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon...

01:04:44.295 --> 01:04:47.728
but this is the first place that looks
like it's hiding from the world.

01:04:47.815 --> 01:04:50.727
To tell the truth, I didn't
really forget to turn the sign on.

01:04:50.814 --> 01:04:53.726
- Just doesn't seem like any use any more.
- Oh?

01:04:53.812 --> 01:04:57.246
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

01:04:57.332 --> 01:05:00.244
- Wanna register?
- Sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.

01:05:00.331 --> 01:05:03.243
- I just wanna ask a few questions.
- No trouble. Today's linen day.

01:05:03.329 --> 01:05:06.241
I always change the beds once a week
whether they've been used or not.

01:05:06.328 --> 01:05:10.891
Hate the smell of dampness. It's such
a, I don't know... creepy smell.

01:05:12.151 --> 01:05:14.150
You out to buy
a motel?

01:05:15.671 --> 01:05:17.583
No.

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:20.364
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen
so many the past couple of days...

01:05:20.494 --> 01:05:22.277
I thought maybe...

01:05:22.363 --> 01:05:25.275
What, uh... What was it
you wanted to ask?

01:05:25.362 --> 01:05:27.883
I'm looking for
a missing person.

01:05:27.969 --> 01:05:30.924
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

01:05:31.012 --> 01:05:33.445
I've been trying
to trace a girl...

01:05:33.531 --> 01:05:36.965
that's been missing for,
oh, about a week now from Phoenix.

01:05:37.051 --> 01:05:39.833
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.919
She's not
in any trouble.

01:05:42.006 --> 01:05:44.874
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

01:05:44.961 --> 01:05:47.003
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:51.653
We have reason to believe she came
along this way. Did she stop here?

01:05:51.741 --> 01:05:54.652
No one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

01:05:54.739 --> 01:05:56.651
Mind looking at the picture
bef ore committing yourself?

01:05:56.737 --> 01:05:58.172
Commit myself?

01:05:58.259 --> 01:06:01.605
- You sure talk like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

01:06:03.213 --> 01:06:05.255
- Mm-mmm. Yeah.
- Sure?

01:06:06.385 --> 01:06:08.254
Well, she may have
used an alias.

01:06:08.384 --> 01:06:10.296
Marion Crane's
her real name...

01:06:10.384 --> 01:06:13.773
but she could've registered
under a different one.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:17.988
I tell ya, I don't even much bother
with guests registering any more.

01:06:18.076 --> 01:06:20.986
One by one,
you drop the formalities.

01:06:21.074 --> 01:06:24.985
I shouldn't even bother changing
the sheets, but old habits die hard.

01:06:25.116 --> 01:06:26.897
Which reminds me...

01:06:28.853 --> 01:06:30.722
- What's that?
- The sign.

01:06:30.808 --> 01:06:34.154
A couple last week said
if the thing hadn't been on...

01:06:34.242 --> 01:06:37.152
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.369
You see,
that's exactly my point.

01:06:39.456 --> 01:06:41.846
Nobody'd been here
for a couple weeks...

01:06:41.933 --> 01:06:45.845
and there's a couple came by
and didn't know that you were open.

01:06:45.975 --> 01:06:48.017
As you say,
old habits die hard.

01:06:48.104 --> 01:06:51.928
This girl could've registered
under another name. Mind if I look?

01:06:52.015 --> 01:06:54.231
- No.
- Thank you.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.273
All right.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:02.097
I'll get the date
somewhere. Mm-hmm.

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:04.661
See, there's nobody.

01:07:04.791 --> 01:07:08.181
Let's see, I have a sample
of her handwriting here.

01:07:09.528 --> 01:07:11.440
Oh, yes.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.439
Here we are.

01:07:13.526 --> 01:07:15.439
- Marie Samuels.
- Hmm.

01:07:15.525 --> 01:07:17.437
That's an interesting
alias.

01:07:17.525 --> 01:07:19.958
- Is that her?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:07:20.045 --> 01:07:21.957
Marie, Marion.

01:07:22.044 --> 01:07:25.217
- Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:25.303 --> 01:07:30.083
Mm-hmm. Was she
in disguise, by any chance?

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:33.777
- Wanna check the picture again?
- I wasn't lying to you.

01:07:33.864 --> 01:07:36.776
Oh, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.

01:07:36.862 --> 01:07:38.731
It's tough keeping track
of the time around here.

01:07:38.818 --> 01:07:40.079
I know.

01:07:40.209 --> 01:07:42.251
Oh, yeah.

01:07:42.338 --> 01:07:47.466
Well, i-i-it was raining
and, um, her hair was all wet.

01:07:47.553 --> 01:07:49.466
I tell ya, it's not really
a very good picture of her.

01:07:49.596 --> 01:07:51.247
No, I guess not.

01:07:51.334 --> 01:07:53.246
Tell me all about her.

01:07:53.333 --> 01:07:55.419
Well, um...

01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:59.635
she arrived, um, rather late
one night, went straight to sleep...

01:07:59.721 --> 01:08:02.242
and, uh, left early
the next morning.

01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:05.457
- How early?
- Oh, ex... very early.

01:08:05.544 --> 01:08:08.761
Mm-hmm.
Which morning was that?

01:08:08.847 --> 01:08:10.759
Uh, the, um...

01:08:10.846 --> 01:08:14.106
Th-Th-Th-The next morning.

01:08:14.192 --> 01:08:16.495
- Sunday.
- I see. Mm-hmm.

01:08:16.582 --> 01:08:18.495
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.

01:08:18.581 --> 01:08:21.276
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:24.144
- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.

01:08:24.231 --> 01:08:26.143
- Locally?
- Uh-uh.

01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:30.140
- Did you spend the night with her?
- No.

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:33.487
Then how would you know
she didn't make any calls?

01:08:35.747 --> 01:08:37.788
Uh, w-w...

01:08:37.876 --> 01:08:40.136
Well, she was very tired
a- and, uh...

01:08:40.223 --> 01:08:42.961
See, I... N-Now I'm starting
to, um... remember.

01:08:43.048 --> 01:08:45.524
I- I'm making a mental picture
of it in my mind.

01:08:45.612 --> 01:08:48.654
- If you make a mental picturization...
- Right. Take your time.

01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:51.912
Um, she was...
she was sitting back there...

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.912
N- No, she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand.

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:57.910
She said she had to
go to sleep early...

01:08:57.997 --> 01:09:02.125
because she had a long d-d-dr-drive,
uh, ahead of her.

01:09:02.212 --> 01:09:04.907
- Mm-hmm. Back where?
- Back where she came from.

01:09:04.993 --> 01:09:07.688
No, you said bef ore she
was standing back there...

01:09:07.819 --> 01:09:09.729
Yes, b-back in my parlour.

01:09:09.817 --> 01:09:12.729
She was very hungry,
I made her a sandwich...

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:17.727
and then she said she was tired and
she, uh, um, had to go r-right to bed.

01:09:17.813 --> 01:09:19.725
I see.
How did she pay you?

01:09:19.813 --> 01:09:21.550
- Cash? Cheque?
- Cash.

01:09:21.638 --> 01:09:23.550
Cash, huh?
Mm-hmm.

01:09:23.636 --> 01:09:28.069
- After she left, she didn't come back?
- Uh-uh. Why should she?

01:09:28.157 --> 01:09:30.242
Hmm.

01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:36.240
Well, M-Mr. Arbogast, uh,
I guess that's about it.

01:09:36.326 --> 01:09:39.890
I- I've got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:42.888
To tell you the truth,
I do mind.

01:09:42.975 --> 01:09:46.321
See, if it doesn't jell,
it isn't aspic, and this ain't jelling.

01:09:46.451 --> 01:09:49.363
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:52.883
Well, I-I-I don't know
what you c-could expect me to know.

01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:54.883
People just come and go,
you know.

01:09:54.969 --> 01:09:57.402
That's right.
She isn't still here, is she?

01:09:57.490 --> 01:09:59.271
No.

01:09:59.358 --> 01:10:04.964
If I wanted to check the cabins, all
twelve, I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

01:10:05.052 --> 01:10:08.441
If you don't believe me, come on
with me. You can help me change beds.

01:10:08.528 --> 01:10:10.483
Oh.
No, thanks.

01:10:27.518 --> 01:10:29.431
Uh, change your mind?

01:10:31.168 --> 01:10:33.081
Oh.

01:10:33.168 --> 01:10:36.949
You know, I... I think I have one of
those faces you can't help believing.

01:10:37.035 --> 01:10:38.860
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

01:10:38.948 --> 01:10:41.512
Oh? There's somebody
sitting in the window.

01:10:41.642 --> 01:10:43.684
- N-N-No, there isn't.
- Sure. Take a look.

01:10:43.814 --> 01:10:45.770
Oh, th-that must be
my mother.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.291
She's an, uh, "inavlid... "
an invalid.

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:50.855
Uh, it's practically
like living alone.

01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:52.984
Oh, I see.

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:57.808
If this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

01:10:57.895 --> 01:11:00.285
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?

01:11:00.415 --> 01:11:02.371
No.

01:11:02.501 --> 01:11:07.239
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

01:11:07.325 --> 01:11:09.367
You'd know
you were being used.

01:11:09.455 --> 01:11:12.453
- You wouldn't be made a fool of.
- I'm not a fool.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.061
And I'm not capable of being fooled,
not even by a woman.

01:11:15.147 --> 01:11:18.102
- This is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.

01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:21.579
She might have fooled me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

01:11:21.666 --> 01:11:24.578
Then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

01:11:24.664 --> 01:11:26.707
No. As I told you,
she's confined.

01:11:26.794 --> 01:11:30.575
Just for a few minutes. There might be
some hint that you missed out on.

01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:33.790
Sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

01:11:33.877 --> 01:11:35.790
- I wouldn't disturb her.
- Mr Arbogast, I-I think I've...

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:39.353
- I think I've talked to you all I want.
- Yes, but just for...

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:42.351
It'd be much better
if you left now. Thanks.

01:11:42.439 --> 01:11:44.437
Well, all right.

01:11:44.525 --> 01:11:48.392
You sure would save me a lot of
leg work if you'd let me talk to her.

01:11:48.479 --> 01:11:51.565
- Would I need a warrant for that too?
- Sure.

01:11:51.651 --> 01:11:53.563
All right.
Thanks, anyway.

01:12:47.972 --> 01:12:51.405
Hello, Loomis.
This is Arbogast. Is Lila there?

01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:53.882
Let me talk to her,
please.

01:12:55.228 --> 01:12:57.314
Hello, Lila.

01:12:57.402 --> 01:13:01.183
Lila, listen.
Marion was up here.

01:13:01.269 --> 01:13:04.181
Yes, she spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

01:13:04.268 --> 01:13:06.180
It's out
on the old highway.

01:13:06.267 --> 01:13:09.700
I even know what cabin she was in...
it was number one.

01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:14.090
Well, this young fella that runs the
place said she just spent the night...

01:13:14.176 --> 01:13:16.870
left the next day
and that was it.

01:13:16.958 --> 01:13:20.347
Mmm.
Um, no, not exactly.

01:13:22.173 --> 01:13:24.084
Well, I did question him,
believe me...

01:13:24.171 --> 01:13:27.083
but I think I got
all there was to get.

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:30.081
I'll just have to pick up
the pieces from here.

01:13:30.168 --> 01:13:33.601
Well, I tell ya,
I don't feel entirely satisfied, uh...

01:13:33.688 --> 01:13:36.600
See, this boy
had a sick old mother.

01:13:36.686 --> 01:13:39.555
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

01:13:39.642 --> 01:13:42.944
No. No, unf ortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

01:13:43.032 --> 01:13:47.507
Well, I was, but I think I'll go
back to the motel first.

01:13:47.595 --> 01:13:51.376
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

01:13:51.462 --> 01:13:53.374
All right, fine.
Listen, I...

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:56.372
You'll be happy to know
what I think.

01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:00.371
Uh, I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

01:14:01.936 --> 01:14:04.804
All right. See ya
in about an hour... or less.

01:14:04.890 --> 01:14:06.802
All right, bye-bye.

01:15:02.471 --> 01:15:04.340
Bates?

01:17:37.656 --> 01:17:41.872
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely
sound. Ever notice that, Lila?

01:17:43.783 --> 01:17:46.695
Sam, he said
an hour or less.

01:17:46.782 --> 01:17:49.042
Yeah.

01:17:49.129 --> 01:17:51.040
It's been three.

01:17:51.128 --> 01:17:53.214
Are we just
going to sit here and wait?

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:55.430
He'll be back.

01:17:55.517 --> 01:17:57.994
Let's sit still
and hang on, okay?

01:18:02.904 --> 01:18:06.338
- How far is the old highway?
- You wanna go out there, don't you?

01:18:06.424 --> 01:18:08.858
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady.
- Yes.

01:18:08.945 --> 01:18:11.205
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!

01:18:11.292 --> 01:18:14.246
- That wouldn't be wise.
- Patience doesn't run in my family.

01:18:14.334 --> 01:18:16.246
- I'm going out there.
- Arbogast said...

01:18:16.332 --> 01:18:18.245
An hour, or less.

01:18:21.852 --> 01:18:23.763
- Well, I'm going.

01:18:23.851 --> 01:18:25.763
You'll never find it.

01:18:28.978 --> 01:18:31.413
- Stay here.
- Why can't I go?

01:18:31.499 --> 01:18:35.410
I don't know. One of us has to be here,
in case he's on the way.

01:18:35.497 --> 01:18:37.931
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?

01:18:38.018 --> 01:18:39.582
Yeah. Stay here.

01:18:59.876 --> 01:19:01.789
Arbogast?

01:19:02.875 --> 01:19:04.788
Arbogast!

01:19:07.656 --> 01:19:09.568
Arbogast!

01:19:38.901 --> 01:19:41.508
- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!

01:19:41.595 --> 01:19:44.898
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

01:19:44.985 --> 01:19:48.201
Sick old lady unable to answer
the door... or unwilling.

01:19:48.288 --> 01:19:50.199
Where could he
have gone?

01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:52.199
Maybe he got
some definite lead.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:54.241
- Maybe he went right on.
- Without calling me?

01:19:54.329 --> 01:19:56.240
- In a hurry.
- Sam, he called...

01:19:56.327 --> 01:19:58.240
when he had nothing
but a dissatisfied feeling.

01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:02.237
Don't you think he'd have called
if he had anything at all?

01:20:02.324 --> 01:20:04.237
Yes, I think
he would've.

01:20:04.323 --> 01:20:06.540
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

01:20:06.626 --> 01:20:10.060
- Our deputy sheriff around here.
- Let me get my coat.

01:20:18.317 --> 01:20:20.229
Good evening.

01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:24.400
Well, I... I don't know where to start,
except at the beginning.

01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:26.400
Yes.

01:20:26.486 --> 01:20:29.398
- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.
- How do you do?

01:20:29.485 --> 01:20:32.397
She's been here
searching for her sister.

01:20:32.483 --> 01:20:34.395
There's this
private detective helping.

01:20:34.483 --> 01:20:37.177
We got a call from this
detective... he'd traced her...

01:20:37.263 --> 01:20:39.132
to that motel
on the old highway.

01:20:39.219 --> 01:20:41.132
That must be
the Bates Motel.

01:20:41.218 --> 01:20:44.261
He called to say he was going
to question Mrs Bates.

01:20:44.347 --> 01:20:46.259
Norman took a wife?

01:20:46.347 --> 01:20:49.736
No, I-I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

01:20:49.823 --> 01:20:52.865
That was early this evening. We
haven't seen or heard from him since.

01:20:52.908 --> 01:20:56.516
Now, your sister's
missing how long?

01:20:56.602 --> 01:20:59.601
She left Phoenix a week ago
yesterday without a trace.

01:20:59.687 --> 01:21:03.338
How'd you and this detective come
to trace her to Fairvale?

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:05.598
They thought
she'd be coming to me.

01:21:05.684 --> 01:21:08.119
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.

01:21:08.205 --> 01:21:10.117
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

01:21:10.205 --> 01:21:12.116
That's right.

01:21:12.203 --> 01:21:14.116
From what?

01:21:15.853 --> 01:21:17.766
She stole some money.

01:21:17.896 --> 01:21:19.852
A lot?

01:21:19.982 --> 01:21:21.938
Forty thousand dollars.

01:21:22.024 --> 01:21:23.980
The police haven't
been able to...

01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:27.674
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back...

01:21:27.761 --> 01:21:30.673
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

01:21:30.759 --> 01:21:32.671
That explains
the private detective.

01:21:32.759 --> 01:21:34.757
He traced her
to the Bates place.

01:21:34.845 --> 01:21:37.756
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

01:21:37.843 --> 01:21:41.145
He said Marion was there
for one night, then she left.

01:21:41.233 --> 01:21:43.145
- With the $40,000?
- He didn't say anything...

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:45.665
about the money.

01:21:45.752 --> 01:21:48.142
It isn't important
what he said, is it?

01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:52.010
He was supposed to come talk to us after
he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

01:21:52.096 --> 01:21:54.009
That's what I want you
to do something about.

01:21:54.096 --> 01:21:55.486
Like what?

01:21:55.574 --> 01:21:58.007
I'm sorry if
I seem overanxious.

01:21:58.093 --> 01:22:01.831
I'm sure there's something wrong
out there, and I have to know what.

01:22:01.918 --> 01:22:05.699
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, Miss, but not the same thing.

01:22:05.785 --> 01:22:08.697
I think what's wrong
is your private detective.

01:22:08.784 --> 01:22:12.869
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was goin'...

01:22:12.956 --> 01:22:14.911
probably from Norman Bates...

01:22:14.999 --> 01:22:18.258
and called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money.

01:22:18.345 --> 01:22:22.734
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

01:22:22.821 --> 01:22:25.385
Call Norman and let him
say what happened.

01:22:25.471 --> 01:22:27.515
At this hour?

01:22:27.601 --> 01:22:31.512
He was out when I was there a while ago.
If he's back, he probably isn't in bed.

01:22:31.599 --> 01:22:36.466
He wasn't out; he just wasn't answerin' the
door in the dead of night like some people do.

01:22:36.553 --> 01:22:39.421
This fellow lives
like a hermit.

01:22:39.509 --> 01:22:42.289
You must remember that bad business
out there about ten years ago.

01:22:42.377 --> 01:22:44.289
Please. Call.

01:22:49.808 --> 01:22:53.936
Florrie, the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the Bates Motel.

01:23:00.107 --> 01:23:03.192
Norman?
Sheriff Chambers.

01:23:03.279 --> 01:23:06.235
Ye... I been
just fine, thanks.

01:23:06.321 --> 01:23:08.885
Listen, we got
worries here.

01:23:08.973 --> 01:23:12.362
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

01:23:13.709 --> 01:23:16.055
Well, this one
wouldn't be a customer.

01:23:16.143 --> 01:23:19.184
- A private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

01:23:19.272 --> 01:23:21.184
Arbogast.

01:23:23.704 --> 01:23:25.616
And after he left?

01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:30.484
No, that's...
that's okay, Norman.

01:23:33.222 --> 01:23:36.132
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl...

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:39.131
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

01:23:39.219 --> 01:23:42.521
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

01:23:42.608 --> 01:23:45.519
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back...

01:23:45.607 --> 01:23:49.039
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:51.039
Yes.

01:23:51.169 --> 01:23:53.993
Norman Bates' mother
has been dead and buried...

01:23:54.081 --> 01:23:58.209
in Greenlawn Cemetery
for the past ten years.

01:23:58.296 --> 01:24:01.903
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:03.901
'Tain't only
local history, Sam.

01:24:03.989 --> 01:24:07.856
It's the only case of murder
and suicide on Fairvale ledgers.

01:24:07.943 --> 01:24:11.724
Mrs Bates poisoned this guy
she was... involved with...

01:24:11.811 --> 01:24:14.245
when she found out
he was married...

01:24:14.331 --> 01:24:17.548
then took a helpin' of
the same stuff herself.

01:24:17.634 --> 01:24:21.241
Strychnine.
Ugly way to die.

01:24:21.328 --> 01:24:24.066
Norman found them
dead together.

01:24:24.153 --> 01:24:27.021
In bed.

01:24:27.108 --> 01:24:29.542
You mean that old woman I saw sittin'
in the window wasn't Bates' mother?

01:24:29.628 --> 01:24:34.191
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:36.625
Yes! In the house
behind the motel!

01:24:36.712 --> 01:24:38.929
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

01:24:39.015 --> 01:24:41.492
You saw
Norman Bates' mother?

01:24:41.579 --> 01:24:45.229
But it had to be...
because Arbogast said so too!

01:24:45.317 --> 01:24:48.967
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

01:24:49.054 --> 01:24:52.965
Well, if the woman up there
is Mrs Bates...

01:24:53.051 --> 01:24:56.702
who's that woman buried
out in Greenlawn Cemetery?

01:25:39.333 --> 01:25:43.505
Now, Mother, um...
I- I'm gonna bring something up...

01:25:43.593 --> 01:25:46.156
I am sorry, boy...

01:25:46.243 --> 01:25:49.850
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

01:25:49.937 --> 01:25:51.849
Please, Mother.

01:25:51.936 --> 01:25:55.108
No!
I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

01:25:55.196 --> 01:25:58.367
Ha! You think
I'm fruity, huh?

01:25:58.455 --> 01:26:00.497
I'm staying right here.

01:26:00.584 --> 01:26:03.452
This is my room and
no one will drag me out of it...

01:26:03.539 --> 01:26:06.016
least of all
my big, bold son.

01:26:06.103 --> 01:26:08.015
They'll come now, Mother.

01:26:08.102 --> 01:26:11.883
He came after the girl,
and now someone will come after him.

01:26:11.970 --> 01:26:16.098
Mother, please, it's just for
a few days so they won't find you.

01:26:16.185 --> 01:26:18.358
Just for a few days?

01:26:18.444 --> 01:26:22.225
In that dark, dank
fruit cellar? No!

01:26:22.313 --> 01:26:25.702
You hid me there once, boy, and you
won't do it again, not ever again!

01:26:25.789 --> 01:26:28.744
Now get out!

01:26:28.831 --> 01:26:32.612
- I told you to get out, boy.
- I'll carry you, Mother.

01:26:32.699 --> 01:26:35.741
Norman, what do you
think you're doing?

01:26:35.828 --> 01:26:39.391
Don't you touch me!
Don't! Norman!

01:26:44.519 --> 01:26:47.691
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

01:26:53.037 --> 01:26:54.948
Wonderful sermon today.

01:26:55.036 --> 01:26:57.513
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.816
We thought we'd drive out
to that motel with you.

01:26:59.946 --> 01:27:02.249
- He's already been.
- Went out bef ore service.

01:27:02.337 --> 01:27:04.944
- Did you two have breakfast?
- Didn't find anything?

01:27:05.031 --> 01:27:08.637
Nothing. Let's
clear the way here.

01:27:08.725 --> 01:27:11.028
What did he say
about my sister?

01:27:11.114 --> 01:27:14.374
Just what he told your detective:
She used a fake name.

01:27:14.461 --> 01:27:18.676
Saw the register myself. Saw the
whole place. That boy's alone there.

01:27:18.806 --> 01:27:21.718
- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.

01:27:21.805 --> 01:27:24.195
I know you're not
the seein'- illusions type...

01:27:24.282 --> 01:27:27.150
but no woman was there and I don't
believe in ghosts, so there it is.

01:27:27.238 --> 01:27:29.149
I still feel
there's something...

01:27:29.236 --> 01:27:32.800
Can see you do. I'm sorry I couldn't
make you feel better.

01:27:32.886 --> 01:27:37.319
Come to my office this afternoon and
report a missing person and a theft.

01:27:37.406 --> 01:27:40.275
The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law...

01:27:40.361 --> 01:27:43.837
that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister bein' picked up.

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:45.967
How 'bout that?

01:27:46.054 --> 01:27:49.140
- I don't know.
- It's Sunday.

01:27:49.226 --> 01:27:53.442
Come to the house and do your reporting
around dinnertime. It'll make it nicer.

01:27:53.529 --> 01:27:55.440
You too, Sam.

01:27:55.528 --> 01:27:58.439
Thank you.

01:27:58.527 --> 01:28:03.437
- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.

01:28:03.567 --> 01:28:06.696
- You want me to drop you at the hotel...
- Sam.

01:28:06.783 --> 01:28:11.433
I still won't feel satisfied
until I go out there.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:14.693
Neither will I.
Come on.

01:28:14.779 --> 01:28:18.864
We better decide what we're gonna say
or do when we walk in there.

01:28:18.951 --> 01:28:21.167
We're going to register
as man and wife.

01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:24.427
We're going to
get shown to a cabin...

01:28:24.513 --> 01:28:28.077
and then we're going to search every
inch of the place, inside and out.

01:28:51.457 --> 01:28:54.368
I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting.

01:28:54.456 --> 01:28:56.368
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.

01:28:56.454 --> 01:28:57.585
Come on.

01:29:00.887 --> 01:29:03.277
- Well?
- Just coming up to ring for you.

01:29:03.364 --> 01:29:05.277
Uh-huh.
Suppose you want a room.

01:29:05.363 --> 01:29:07.796
We were gonna try to make it
to San Francisco...

01:29:07.884 --> 01:29:10.273
but we don't like the look
of that sky.

01:29:10.404 --> 01:29:13.316
Looks like a bad day coming,
doesn't it?

01:29:20.182 --> 01:29:22.616
- I'll take you to cabin ten.
- Better sign in first, hadn't we?

01:29:22.702 --> 01:29:24.614
That's not necessary.

01:29:24.702 --> 01:29:28.395
My boss is paying for this trip
and, uh, well, it's 90%business.

01:29:28.483 --> 01:29:31.263
He wants practically
notarized receipts.

01:29:31.351 --> 01:29:34.305
I'd better sign in
and get a receipt.

01:29:52.123 --> 01:29:54.035
Thank you.

01:29:56.425 --> 01:29:58.338
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:04.986
- I'll show you the room, then.
- First time I've ever seen it happen.

01:30:05.073 --> 01:30:06.985
You check in any other place
in this country without bags...

01:30:07.072 --> 01:30:10.984
- and you have to pay in advance.
- Ten dollars.

01:30:17.589 --> 01:30:19.935
That receipt.

01:30:24.803 --> 01:30:27.410
I'll go on ahead.

01:30:32.104 --> 01:30:35.058
All right, there's
your receipt. I'll show you the cabin.

01:30:35.145 --> 01:30:38.013
Don't bother yourself.
We'll find it.

01:30:56.526 --> 01:30:58.830
Sam, we have to go into that cabin
and search it...

01:30:58.916 --> 01:31:01.871
no matter what we're afraid of
finding or how much it may hurt.

01:31:01.959 --> 01:31:03.870
I know.

01:31:03.957 --> 01:31:05.870
Do you think if something
happened, it happened there?

01:31:05.956 --> 01:31:07.868
I don't know, but if you had...

01:31:07.956 --> 01:31:11.388
a useless business like this motel,
what would you need to get out?

01:31:11.476 --> 01:31:14.822
To get a new business somewhere else?
Forty thousand dollars?

01:31:17.646 --> 01:31:19.732
How could we prove that...

01:31:19.819 --> 01:31:22.600
If he opens a motel on
the new highway in, say, a year...

01:31:22.688 --> 01:31:24.904
There must be some proof
that exists now...

01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:28.206
something that proves he got
that money away from Marion somehow.

01:31:28.294 --> 01:31:33.248
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

01:31:33.334 --> 01:31:35.246
Or he felt sorry for me
and he was beginning to feel...

01:31:35.376 --> 01:31:36.941
the same way about you.

01:31:37.028 --> 01:31:39.766
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

01:31:39.853 --> 01:31:42.286
He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done
anything without telling us...

01:31:42.374 --> 01:31:43.764
unless he was stopped.

01:31:43.850 --> 01:31:47.631
And he was stopped. So he must
have found out something.

01:31:49.978 --> 01:31:52.629
We'll start with cabin one.

01:31:54.498 --> 01:31:57.627
If he sees us,
we're just taking the air.

01:32:29.611 --> 01:32:31.566
Bates.

01:33:20.238 --> 01:33:22.194
No shower curtain.

01:33:22.281 --> 01:33:24.758
- Sam! Look!
- Huh? What is it?

01:33:24.888 --> 01:33:27.018
It's figuring. It didn't
get washed down. Look.

01:33:27.104 --> 01:33:31.015
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

01:33:31.146 --> 01:33:33.580
That proves Marion was here.
It'd be too wild a coincidence...

01:33:33.667 --> 01:33:35.578
Bates never denied she was here.

01:33:35.666 --> 01:33:38.795
Oh. Doesn't that prove
he found out about the money?

01:33:38.882 --> 01:33:41.489
Do we simply ask him
where he's hidden it?

01:33:41.576 --> 01:33:44.922
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

01:33:45.009 --> 01:33:48.355
I want her to tell us
the same thing.

01:33:48.442 --> 01:33:50.659
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?

01:33:50.745 --> 01:33:52.657
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

01:33:52.745 --> 01:33:55.916
One of us can keep him occupied while
the other gets to the old woman.

01:33:56.004 --> 01:33:59.263
You'll never be able to hold him
still if he doesn't want to be held.

01:33:59.350 --> 01:34:02.305
I don't like you going
into that house alone.

01:34:02.392 --> 01:34:04.304
I can handle a sick old woman.

01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:07.302
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

01:34:08.345 --> 01:34:10.301
Wait a minute.

01:34:10.388 --> 01:34:13.647
If you get anything
out of the mother...

01:34:13.734 --> 01:34:15.907
can you find your way
back to town?

01:34:15.993 --> 01:34:18.297
Yes, of course.

01:34:18.384 --> 01:34:21.774
If you do get anything,
don't stop to tell me.

01:34:44.589 --> 01:34:47.152
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact.

01:34:47.283 --> 01:34:49.412
Wife's taking a nap and...

01:34:49.499 --> 01:34:53.454
I never can keep quiet enough for her,
so I thought I'd look you up and talk.

01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:56.843
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.

01:36:09.982 --> 01:36:12.936
I've been doing all the talking
so far, haven't I?

01:36:13.024 --> 01:36:15.457
I thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time...

01:36:15.544 --> 01:36:17.890
who did all the talking
when they got the chance.

01:36:18.021 --> 01:36:20.107
Here you are
doing all the listening.

01:36:20.194 --> 01:36:22.671
- You are alone here, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

01:36:22.758 --> 01:36:25.322
Drive me crazy.

01:36:25.409 --> 01:36:28.364
I think that would be a rather
extreme reaction, don't you?

01:36:28.450 --> 01:36:33.535
Just an expression. What I meant was,
uh, I'd do anything to get away.

01:36:33.665 --> 01:36:35.621
- Wouldn't you?
- No.

01:36:39.662 --> 01:36:42.835
- Mrs Bates?

01:37:59.710 --> 01:38:02.231
I'm not saying you
shouldn't be contented here...

01:38:02.318 --> 01:38:04.230
I'm just doubting that you are.

01:38:04.361 --> 01:38:07.924
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under you'd unload this place.

01:38:08.011 --> 01:38:11.922
This place? This place happens
to be my only world.

01:38:12.009 --> 01:38:14.921
I grew up in that house.
I had a very happy childhood.

01:38:15.007 --> 01:38:17.659
My mother and I
were more than happy.

01:39:19.497 --> 01:39:21.888
You look frightened. Have I been
saying something frightening?

01:39:21.974 --> 01:39:23.887
I don't know
what you've been saying.

01:39:23.974 --> 01:39:27.103
I've been talking about your mother,
about your motel.

01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:29.363
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

01:39:29.449 --> 01:39:32.187
Buy a new one in a new town where you
won't have to hide your mother.

01:39:32.274 --> 01:39:35.142
Why don't you just get in
your car and drive away?

01:39:35.229 --> 01:39:39.097
Where will you get the money to do that?
Or do you already have it socked away?

01:39:39.227 --> 01:39:42.443
- Shut up!
- A lot of it. Forty thousand dollars.

01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:49.396
I bet your mother knows where the money
is and what you did to get it.

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:53.177
I think
she'll tell us.

01:39:53.263 --> 01:39:56.871
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?

01:41:01.708 --> 01:41:04.055
Mrs Bates, it's...

01:41:23.524 --> 01:41:27.652
Norman Bates!

01:41:55.942 --> 01:41:59.593
If anyone gets any answers
it'll be the psychiatrist.

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:02.374
Even I couldn't get to Norman
and he knows me.

01:42:02.461 --> 01:42:04.460
- You warm enough, miss?
- Yes.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:08.415
Did he talk
to you?

01:42:08.458 --> 01:42:11.370
No.

01:42:11.457 --> 01:42:16.498
I got the whole story, but not from
Norman. I got it from his "mother. "

01:42:17.758 --> 01:42:21.322
Norman Bates
no longer exists.

01:42:21.409 --> 01:42:24.103
He only half-existed
to begin with.

01:42:24.190 --> 01:42:28.274
And now the other half
has taken over...

01:42:28.362 --> 01:42:30.926
probably for all time.

01:42:32.664 --> 01:42:34.663
Did he kill my sister?

01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:38.270
Yes... and no.

01:42:38.357 --> 01:42:41.008
Now look, if you're trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork...

01:42:41.095 --> 01:42:43.789
for some sort of plea
this fellow would like to cop...

01:42:43.876 --> 01:42:46.961
A psychiatrist
doesn't lay the groundwork.

01:42:47.048 --> 01:42:49.438
He merely tries
to explain it.

01:42:49.525 --> 01:42:52.524
- But my sister is...
- Yes.

01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:59.477
Yes, I'm sorry.
The private investigator too.

01:42:59.564 --> 01:43:03.388
If you drag that swamp somewhere in
the vicinity of the motel, you'll...

01:43:07.386 --> 01:43:10.254
Uh, have you any unsolved
missing persons cases on your books?

01:43:10.342 --> 01:43:13.513
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?

01:43:13.601 --> 01:43:16.642
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said...

01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:18.642
the "mother. "

01:43:20.467 --> 01:43:24.464
To understand it the way I understood
it, hearing it from the "mother"...

01:43:24.595 --> 01:43:28.115
that is from the "mother" half
of Norman's mind...

01:43:28.202 --> 01:43:31.157
you have to go back
ten years...

01:43:31.244 --> 01:43:33.721
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

01:43:33.851 --> 01:43:38.893
He was already dangerously disturbed,
had been since his father died.

01:43:40.588 --> 01:43:45.193
His mother was
a clinging, demanding woman...

01:43:45.281 --> 01:43:49.192
and for years the two of them lived as
if there was no one else in the world.

01:43:50.713 --> 01:43:53.190
Then she met a man...

01:43:53.276 --> 01:43:57.709
and it seemed to Norman that
she threw him over for this man.

01:43:57.797 --> 01:44:01.186
That pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

01:44:01.273 --> 01:44:05.445
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all...

01:44:07.314 --> 01:44:11.181
most unbearable
to the son who commits it.

01:44:11.268 --> 01:44:16.613
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

01:44:19.003 --> 01:44:21.480
He stole her corpse.

01:44:23.349 --> 01:44:26.434
A weighted coffin
was buried.

01:44:26.521 --> 01:44:29.389
He hid the body
in the fruit cellar...

01:44:29.477 --> 01:44:32.562
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

01:44:32.648 --> 01:44:35.430
And that still
wasn't enough.

01:44:35.517 --> 01:44:39.255
She was there...
but she was a corpse.

01:44:41.774 --> 01:44:44.556
So he began to think
and speak for her...

01:44:44.643 --> 01:44:47.685
give her half his life,
so to speak.

01:44:47.771 --> 01:44:52.378
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

01:44:52.465 --> 01:44:56.767
At other times, the "mother" half
took over completely.

01:44:56.855 --> 01:45:01.418
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only "Mother"...

01:45:03.199 --> 01:45:06.763
and because he was so
pathologically jealous of her...

01:45:06.849 --> 01:45:09.501
he assumed that she
was as jealous of him.

01:45:09.587 --> 01:45:14.889
Theref ore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman...

01:45:14.976 --> 01:45:18.669
the "mother" side of him
would go wild.

01:45:21.016 --> 01:45:23.972
When he met your sister...

01:45:24.058 --> 01:45:26.622
he was touched by her,
aroused by her.

01:45:26.710 --> 01:45:29.490
He wanted her.

01:45:29.578 --> 01:45:33.445
That set off the jealous "mother"
and "Mother" killed the girl.

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:40.399
After the murder Norman returned
as if from a deep sleep...

01:45:40.485 --> 01:45:44.179
and, like a dutiful son, covered up
all traces of the crime...

01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:46.656
he was convinced
his "mother" had committed!

01:45:46.743 --> 01:45:49.220
Why was he...
dressed like that?

01:45:49.307 --> 01:45:52.175
He's a transvestite.

01:45:52.262 --> 01:45:54.913
Uh, not exactly.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.563
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change...

01:45:58.651 --> 01:46:00.867
or satisf action,
is a transvestite.

01:46:00.953 --> 01:46:05.169
But in Norman's case, he was simply
doing everything possible...

01:46:05.256 --> 01:46:08.471
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

01:46:09.905 --> 01:46:12.948
And when reality
came to close...

01:46:13.034 --> 01:46:16.598
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion...

01:46:18.988 --> 01:46:22.030
he dressed up, even to
a cheap wig he bought.

01:46:22.117 --> 01:46:26.071
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

01:46:26.159 --> 01:46:28.375
He tried to be
his mother.

01:46:29.982 --> 01:46:33.111
And, uh, now he is.

01:46:33.199 --> 01:46:38.196
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the "mother. "

01:46:38.283 --> 01:46:42.194
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities...

01:46:42.281 --> 01:46:45.801
there's always
a conflict, a battle.

01:46:45.888 --> 01:46:49.538
In Norman's case,
the battle is over...

01:46:49.626 --> 01:46:51.754
and the dominant personality
has won.

01:46:51.842 --> 01:46:55.926
And the $40,000?
Who got that?

01:46:56.014 --> 01:46:59.751
The swamp. These were
crimes of passion, not profit.

01:47:01.532 --> 01:47:04.227
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

01:47:05.574 --> 01:47:07.529
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

01:47:20.132 --> 01:47:22.522
Thank you.

01:47:29.171 --> 01:47:32.127
It's sad when
a mother has to speak the words...

01:47:32.213 --> 01:47:34.473
that condemn her own son...

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:38.341
but I couldn't allow them
to believe that I would commit murder.

01:47:38.427 --> 01:47:42.817
They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.

01:47:42.904 --> 01:47:45.772
He was always bad,
and in the end...

01:47:45.858 --> 01:47:50.335
he intended to tell them I killed
those girls and that man...

01:47:50.421 --> 01:47:54.072
as if I could do anything
except sit and stare...

01:47:54.159 --> 01:47:57.158
like one
of his stuffed birds.

01:47:57.244 --> 01:48:00.764
They know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.

01:48:00.895 --> 01:48:06.457
I'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.

01:48:09.499 --> 01:48:13.280
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

01:48:13.367 --> 01:48:17.147
Let them see
what kind of a person I am.

01:48:17.235 --> 01:48:19.538
I'm not even
gonna swat that fly.

01:48:19.624 --> 01:48:23.014
I hope they are watching.
They'll see.

01:48:23.102 --> 01:48:25.013
They'll see
and they'll know...

01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:30.794
and they'll say, "Why, she
wouldn't even harm a fly. "

01:48:31.305 --> 01:48:37.462
