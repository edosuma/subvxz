00:22.156 --> 00:25.259
[children playing]

00:32.700 --> 00:35.636
[beep]

YOU'RE TURNING INTO ONE OF THOSE

00:44.312 --> 00:46.280
WOMEN WE USED TO MAKE FUN OF.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.282
- SHE'S GOT YOUR FAIR SKIN.
SHE'LL BURN.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.351
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:52.353 --> 00:54.088
- LOOK, WHAT'S THAT?

00:54.088 --> 00:55.156

00:59.193 --> 01:01.495

- OH, WHERE YOU GOING?

01:01.495 --> 01:03.431
- DO YOU WANT TO PLAY?
DO YOU WANT TO COME PLAY?

01:03.431 --> 01:05.466
- I'M TWO DOZEN EMAILS BEHIND.
CAN YOU TAKE THE FIRST SHIFT?

01:05.466 --> 01:07.401
- OKAY, SURE, BUT LISTEN,
BE QUICK, OKAY?

01:07.401 --> 01:09.170
IT'S LIKE THEY KNOW
I'M ON KID DUTY.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.304
- OKAY. LET'S GO PLAY.
[child fussing]

01:10.304 --> 01:11.639
- PLAY, YEAH. PLAY.
- LET'S GO PLAY.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.142
- PLAY? PLAY?
- YEAH, GO PLAY.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.643
- MAMA.

01:15.643 --> 01:19.447
MA MAMA.

01:19.447 --> 01:22.216
[babbling]

01:29.757 --> 01:34.162
- I'M AT THE PLAYGROUND.
TALK LOUD AND FAST.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.463
[sighs]

01:35.463 --> 01:37.165
MY BEST SALESMAN
HAD THE WRONG DATA

01:37.165 --> 01:39.233
FOR HIS POWERPOINT.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.335
- YOU BAIL HIM OUT?
- OH, THEY'RE IDIOTS.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.171
THEY CAN'T EVEN--
- WHERE'S TESSA?

01:43.171 --> 01:45.239
- SHE'S PLAYING IN THE SAND.
- TESSA!

01:45.239 --> 01:48.142
TESSA!
TESSA?

01:48.142 --> 01:51.712
- OKAY, SHE WAS RIGHT HERE.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.447
- TESSA!

01:53.447 --> 01:56.317
HEY, HEY.
TESSA?

01:57.785 --> 02:00.288
- TESSA!
TESSA!

02:00.288 --> 02:01.789

02:01.789 --> 02:06.694
both: TESSA! TESSA! TESSA!
TESSA! TESSA!

02:06.694 --> 02:08.896
- [hyperventilating]

02:08.896 --> 02:11.165
- JOSIE, I NEED YOU TO--
I NEED YOU TO STAY CALM,

02:11.165 --> 02:12.833
NOW TRY TO BREATHE, OKAY?
- [staggered breath]

02:12.833 --> 02:14.902
- LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU, SHE--
- THERE YOU GO.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.570
- SHE WAS PLAYING
IN THE SAND.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.739
I TOOK A CALL, I LOOKED UP,
SHE WAS GONE.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.841
- WHAT TIME WAS THE CALL?
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.576
- WELL, IT'LL BE ON YOUR CELL.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.478
- THAT'S GOOD.
TAKE A BREATH, AND TELL ME,

02:24.478 --> 02:27.715
WHAT WAS TESSA WEARING?
- PINK PANTS.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.517
A PINK JACKET.
- OKAY.

02:29.517 --> 02:34.355
- THIS IS FROM EARLIER
THIS MORNING.

02:34.355 --> 02:38.292
- OH, WAIT, WAIT, HOLD UP.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.261
WHO'S THAT?

02:40.261 --> 02:41.229
- SEE THIS GUY
IN THE PARK TODAY?

02:41.229 --> 02:42.663
- NO.
- UN-UH.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.399
- ONE-YEAR-OLD GIRL,
BLOND HAIR, PINK OUTFIT?

02:45.399 --> 02:46.734
- MM-MM.
- EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.536
YOU SEE THIS MAN
AT THE PLAYGROUND?

02:48.536 --> 02:50.838
- NOT TODAY,
BUT HE'S BEEN HERE BEFORE.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.341
HE'S NOT A PARENT.
THEY SAY HE'S ON THE LIST.

02:53.341 --> 02:57.345
I TAKE HIS PICTURE AND I CALL
THE PRECINCT WHEN I SEE HIM.

02:57.345 --> 02:59.513
THERE.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.249
[door opens]

03:01.249 --> 03:03.251
- ALLEN CLYDE?
- POLICE.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.386
- I DON'T WANT TROUBLE.
- WHERE IS SHE?

03:05.386 --> 03:07.321
- YOU GOT A LITTLE GIRL IN HERE,
ALLEN?

03:07.321 --> 03:09.257
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
- NO?

03:09.257 --> 03:10.724
YOU'RE A SEX OFFENDER
AND YOU WERE AT THE PLAYGROUND.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.260
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE
THIS MORNING?

03:12.260 --> 03:13.561
- I WORK THE NIGHT SHIFT
AS A JANITOR.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.329
I WAS JUST CUTTING THROUGH
THE PARK.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.898
- TALK TO THIS LITTLE GIRL?

03:17.898 --> 03:19.333
- I JUST WANTED
TO HELP HER DOWN.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.303
SHE WAS SCARED.
- WHERE IS SHE?

03:22.303 --> 03:23.971
- I DON'T KNOW.
HER MOTHER TOOK HER.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.607
- TRY AGAIN, THE MOTHER
DOESN'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.876
- NO, NO, I'M NOT LYING!
SHE LEFT WITH HER MOM.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.611
- YEAH? WHAT DID
THE MOTHER LOOK LIKE?

03:30.611 --> 03:33.013
- UH, STRAIGHT BLOND HAIR,
SEE-THROUGH DRESS WITH, LIKE,

03:33.013 --> 03:34.582
A BLACK PATTERN ON IT.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.417
SHE'S GOT THAT BABY.
GO FIND HER!

03:36.417 --> 03:38.286
- ALLEN, YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE IN THAT PLAYGROUND.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.354
LET'S GO!

04:27.668 --> 04:29.503
- [snoring]

04:29.503 --> 04:33.006
- THE SEX OFFENDER FROM THE
PLAYGROUND FALLS ASLEEP HERE?

04:33.006 --> 04:35.876
NOT A GOOD SIGN.
- COULD BE THE JOINT HE SMOKED.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.379
ALLEN WAS WINDING DOWN
FROM A NIGHT SHIFT.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.914
- THE OTHER MOTHERS IN THE PARK
SAID THAT THEY KNOW THIS GUY.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.850
THEY SAID THAT HE HANGS AROUND
AND HE WATCHES.

04:42.850 --> 04:46.320
- TESSA WASN'T IN HIS APARTMENT.
WE CHECKED THE SURROUNDING AREA.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.756
HE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME
TO STASH HER.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.658
- OKAY, WAKE HIM UP,
MAKE HIM GO OVER HIS MORNING.

04:50.658 --> 04:55.963
THIS MOTHER HE SAW TAKE TESSA?
EVERY DETAIL.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.767
- THE DAD VIDEOTAPED TESSA
GETTING SUNSCREEN PUT ON.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.034
I MEAN, IS THAT
WHAT PARENTS DO NOW?

05:01.034 --> 05:02.770
JUST RECORD EVERYTHING?

05:02.770 --> 05:04.738
- WELL, YOU DON'T WANT
TO MISS A MOMENT.

05:04.738 --> 05:09.009
- IF MY MOTHER TOOK ME TO
WALMART FOR THE EASTER PHOTO

05:09.009 --> 05:10.644
AND TO THE MALL
FOR THE ONE WITH SANTA,

05:10.644 --> 05:12.346
BY THE TIME
MY SISTER CAME AROUND?

05:12.346 --> 05:13.647
NO ONE EVEN BOTHERED
WITH THAT.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.916
- MM.
LOOK, THERE'S OUR S.O.R.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.786
- ALLEN CLAIMS HE SAW
A BLOND WOMAN TAKE HER.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.088
- WELL, THERE'S LOTS
OF BLOND MOMS.

05:21.088 --> 05:25.526
- MM, YOU KNOW,
LOOK FOR ONE IN A FLORAL DRESS.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.661
- LIKE HER?
- YEAH.

05:27.661 --> 05:31.399
- HANG ON, ISN'T THAT THE SAME
DIAPER BAG THAT TESSA'S MOM HAS?

05:31.399 --> 05:34.468
[keyboard clicking]

05:37.871 --> 05:39.973
- AND THAT'S
THE DAD'S BABY CARRIER.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.543
- SO, ALLEN COULD BE
TELLING THE TRUTH?

05:42.543 --> 05:45.379
- NO ONE LOOKS TWICE AT A MOM
LEAVING THE PARK WITH A BABY

05:45.379 --> 05:46.680
IN HER SLING.
- YEAH.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.048
OKAY, I'LL GO TELL CAPTAIN.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.051
DOWNTOWN THERE'S VIDEO
SURVEILLANCE EVERYWHERE.

05:51.051 --> 05:54.755
WE GOTTA GO BACK OVER
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.857
- THAT'S TESSA.
WHO'S THAT WOMAN?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.626
- WELL, WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.561
WE GOT THIS FROM A SECURITY
CAMERA ON MURRAY STREET.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.929
NOW, YOU'RE SURE...

06:01.929 --> 06:04.064
THAT YOU'VE
NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE?

06:04.064 --> 06:05.599
- NO, NO,
SHE'S NOT ONE OF THE MOMS.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.835
WHO IS SHE?
WHY WOULD SHE DO THIS?

06:07.835 --> 06:09.803
- WELL, SOMETIMES WHEN A WOMAN
TAKES A BABY, IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S

06:09.803 --> 06:11.572
FANTASIZED A RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE CHILD.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.775
OFTENTIMES,
THEY'VE WATCHED THE FAMILY.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.545
- I WOULD HAVE NOTICED HER
HANGING AROUND.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.780
- YOUR JOB, DOES IT EVER
TAKE YOU OUT OF TOWN?

06:19.780 --> 06:22.883
DO YOU EVER LEAVE TESSA HERE
WITH YOUR HUSBAND?

06:22.883 --> 06:26.420
- YES, JOSIE TRAVELS FOR WORK.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

06:26.420 --> 06:30.491
- NOW LOOK, BRAYDON, WE JUST
WANT TO FIND YOUR DAUGHTER.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.794
- I WOULD NEVER BRING
ANOTHER WOMAN HOME.

06:33.794 --> 06:37.097
- ANYONE ELSE HAVE ACCESS
TO YOUR PLACE?

06:37.097 --> 06:40.834
- UH, TESSA'S NANNY
IS WITH HER ON WEEKDAYS.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.536
- CARMEN SILVA.
SHE'S GUATEMALAN, BUT SHE'S BEEN

06:42.536 --> 06:43.771
HERE FOR TEN YEARS.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.739
- OKAY, I'M GONNA NEED
HER ADDRESS.

06:45.739 --> 06:49.943
- ADDRESS, PHONE NUMBER, COPY OF
HER PASSPORT, I HAVE ALL OF IT.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.945
- OH, NO, LITTLE TESSA?
WHO WOULD TAKE HER?

06:51.945 --> 06:53.814
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
TRYING TO FIND OUT.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.883
WHO ELSE LIVES HERE?

06:55.883 --> 06:59.820
- UH, MI ABUELITA, MI MAMA,
HER SISTERS, MY COUSINS.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.154
- WELL, YOU WATCH TESSA
12 HOURS A DAY.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.724
ANYBODY EVER HELP YOU
WITH HER?

07:03.724 --> 07:05.959
OR, YOU LEAVE HER ALONE
WITH SOMEBODY?

07:05.959 --> 07:08.195
- OH, NO, NO, I KEEP TESSA
ALWAYS WITH ME.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.464
I NEVER TAKE HER TO MCDONALD'S.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.999
I NEVER LET ANYONE
IN THE HOUSE.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.803
- HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS WOMAN?

07:15.803 --> 07:17.571
- YES. SHE'S THE ONE

07:17.571 --> 07:19.773
WHO TAKES THE PICTURES
IN THE PARK OF THE BABIES.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.809
- YOU KNOW HER NAME?
- NO.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.777
BUT FOR MOTHER'S DAY,
SHE GAVE ME

07:23.777 --> 07:28.949
A PICTURE SHE TOOK
OF ME AND TESSA.

07:28.949 --> 07:34.254
I BOUGHT A FRAME
TO KEEP IT NICE.

07:34.254 --> 07:37.057
"LIFEMOMENTSBYDIA.COM."

07:41.629 --> 07:45.165
[pounding at door]

07:45.165 --> 07:46.700
- OPEN IT UP.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.036
THERE'S A MISSING BABY.
OPEN IT UP.

07:49.036 --> 07:53.173
[keys jingling,
lock opening]

08:01.882 --> 08:04.952
[distant humming,
baby babbling]

08:11.525 --> 08:13.226
- DIA NOBILE?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:13.226 --> 08:14.828
- POLICE.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.998
- DIA, WE NEED TO GET THAT BABY
BACK TO HER MOM AND DAD.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.834
- IT'S OKAY, I'M HER MOM.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.236
- YOU'RE TAKING GOOD CARE
OF HER.

08:23.236 --> 08:26.707
- OF COURSE I AM.
SHE'S MINE.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.942
- SO THEN, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
GONNA WANT TO KEEP HER SAFE

08:28.942 --> 08:33.080
UNTIL WE GET ALL OF THIS
STRAIGHTENED OUT, RIGHT?

08:33.080 --> 08:36.784
- YOU WOULD HELP ME WITH THAT?
- ABSOLUTELY, DIA.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.787
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A DAUGHTER.
I GET IT.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.024
- SO THE BEST THING RIGHT NOW,
DIA,

08:44.024 --> 08:48.562
IS FOR YOU TO LET ME HOLD HER,
OKAY?

08:48.562 --> 08:51.298
- OKAY, JUST--
PLEASE, BE CAREFUL.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.801
- HEY, SWEETIE.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.670
COME HERE, SWEETHEART, YEAH.
- [babbles]

08:56.670 --> 08:58.639
- IT'S OKAY, LOVIE.
IT'S OKAY.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.807
- NO, STOP!

08:59.807 --> 09:01.709
NO, SHE'S MY BABY!
SHE'S MINE!

09:01.709 --> 09:03.310
- DIA NOBILE,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.646
- YOU CAN'T ARREST ME.
I'M HER MOTHER.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.080
I PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER
IN A FOLDER.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.949
IT'S ON THE DRESSER.
JUST LOOK AT IT.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.083
- I WILL. WE WILL.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.852
- IT'S ALL THERE.
[baby crying]

09:11.852 --> 09:13.253
HER BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
IT PROVES THAT I'M HER MOTHER.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.888
PLEASE, PLEASE.
- IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

09:14.888 --> 09:18.091
- MOMMY. I WANT MOMMY!
- I KNOW. I KNOW, LOVIE.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.160
- [crying]

09:23.864 --> 09:25.298
- THE DOCTORS SAY THAT
PHYSICALLY SHE'S FINE.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.167
SHE'S UNHURT.
- YOU'RE OKAY, BABY.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.636
- WE CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.671
WE'LL BE TAKING HER HOME NOW.

09:30.671 --> 09:33.841
- YEAH, WE JUST NEED
TO CLEAR UP A FEW THINGS.

09:33.841 --> 09:36.644
- WHAT ELSE IS THERE
TO CLEAR UP?

09:36.644 --> 09:41.882
- THE WOMAN WHO TOOK TESSA,
DIA NOBILE, SHE HAS A BEDROOM

09:41.882 --> 09:45.653
IN HER LOFT THAT'S EXTREMELY
SIMILAR TO TESSA'S.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.655
AND YOUR NANNY SAID
THAT SHE DIDN'T LET HER IN.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.957
- NEITHER DID WE.
WE TOLD YOU THAT.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.859
- YOUR APARTMENT'S NOT FOR SALE,
IS IT?

09:51.859 --> 09:53.861
- WELL, IT WAS ON THE MARKET
LAST SPRING.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.796
YOU CAN CHECK WITH OUR BROKER.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.365
- SHE ALSO SAID
THAT SHE GAVE BIRTH TO TESSA,

09:58.365 --> 10:01.301
AND THAT SHE GAVE HER UP
FOR ADOPTION.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.303
- SO SHE'S A NUT JOB.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.272
- WELL SHE DOES HAVE A BIRTH
CERTIFICATE FOR A BABY GIRL,

10:05.272 --> 10:07.174
SAME AGE AS TESSA.

10:07.174 --> 10:10.678
- BUT IT'S NOT TESSA'S.
- BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT ONE?

10:10.678 --> 10:15.382
CAN WE GET A COPY OF THAT,
JUST FOR PROTOCOL?

10:17.184 --> 10:21.722
- UH, YOU ARE
TESSA'S BIOLOGICAL MOTHER?

10:23.356 --> 10:26.193
- TESSA WAS BORN THROUGH
A SURROGATE.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.161
- WITH BRAYDON'S SPERM.
- WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES

10:28.161 --> 10:29.863
THAT MAKE?
WHY IS THAT ANYONE'S BUSINESS?

10:29.863 --> 10:32.232
- OKAY.

10:32.232 --> 10:35.235
WAS IT THROUGH A PRIVATE
SURROGACY, OR THROUGH AN AGENCY?

10:35.235 --> 10:36.303
- PRIVATE.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.838
OUR LAWYER FOUND
THE BIRTH MOTHER.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.339
SHE WAS A WONDERFUL WOMAN.
ERIN?

10:39.339 --> 10:41.141
SHE WAS STUDYING TO BE A VET.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.743
WE HELPED HER PAY
HER COLLEGE BILLS,

10:42.743 --> 10:45.979
AND SHE HELPED US.
- SO YOU HAVE ALL THE PAPERWORK?

10:45.979 --> 10:48.882
SURROGACY AGREEMENT,
ADOPTION PAPERS?

10:48.882 --> 10:50.884
- YES, EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER.
WE CAN SCAN YOU THE PAPERS.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.353
- TESSA IS OURS.

10:53.353 --> 10:56.056
- SO JOSIE DIDN'T GIVE BIRTH
TO TESSA,

10:56.056 --> 10:59.126
AND DIA SAYS
SHE'S THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.260
- SHE SWEARS
THAT SHE WAS TRICKED

11:00.260 --> 11:02.162
INTO LETTING THEM ADOPT TESSA.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.764
- AND THE LEDDYS SWEAR
THAT THEY'VE NEVER SEEN

11:03.764 --> 11:05.365
OR HEARD OF HER BEFORE NOW?

11:05.365 --> 11:08.301
SHE SOUNDS DELUSIONAL.
- BUT SHE DID HAVE A FILE

11:08.301 --> 11:11.138
WAITING FOR US WITH
A COPY OF THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE

11:11.138 --> 11:13.040
AND THE TERMINATION
OF HER PARENTAL RIGHTS.

11:13.040 --> 11:17.144
- AND ST. LUKE'S CONFIRMS
DIA DELIVERED

11:17.144 --> 11:19.379
"BABY GIRL NOBILE,"
NO FATHER LISTED,

11:19.379 --> 11:21.214
THE SAME WEEK TESSA WAS BORN.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.350
- NICK, I MEAN, THE LEDDYS
DID HOLD OUT ON US.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.285
TESSA WAS BORN TO A SURROGATE,

11:25.285 --> 11:26.920
AND THE LEDDYS
DIDN'T LET US KNOW THAT

11:26.920 --> 11:28.288
UNTIL AFTER WE FOUND HER.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.791
- OKAY,
WELL HOW'S THEIR PAPERWORK?

11:30.791 --> 11:34.194
- UH, NEW YORK STATE BIRTH
CERTIFICATE FOR A HOME BIRTH,

11:34.194 --> 11:36.063
THE MOTHER LISTED
AS AN ERIN MURPHY,

11:36.063 --> 11:38.131
THE FATHER, BRAYDON LEDDY.
A SECOND BIRTH CERTIFICATE

11:38.131 --> 11:40.901
LISTING JOSIE LEDDY
AS THE ADOPTIVE MOTHER.

11:40.901 --> 11:46.039
THEY ALSO HAD THE TERMINATION OF
ERIN MURPHY'S PARENTAL RIGHTS.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.941
- AND I JUST FOUND
A BIG RED FLAG.

11:47.941 --> 11:52.279
DIA'S ADOPTION PAPERS AND
THE LEDDYS' SURROGACY AGREEMENT

11:52.279 --> 11:55.315
WERE DRAFTED BY THE SAME LAWYER?
WENDELL FEENEY?

11:55.315 --> 11:57.785
- WHERE IS MR. FEENEY?

11:57.785 --> 12:00.187
- F-E-E-N-E-Y?
- YEAH.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.455
- FINDING ONE WENDELL FEENEY
OUT IN PATCHOGUE.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.257
A PERSONAL INJURY LAWYER.

12:04.257 --> 12:07.260
- CAPTAIN, I GOTTA TELL YOU.
BY THE LOOK IN HER EYE,

12:07.260 --> 12:10.030
DIA MAY HAVE A CONNECTION
TO THIS BABY.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.232
- WELL WHAT I SAW IN HER EYE
WAS A WHOLE LOT OF CRAZY.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.134
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
WE FOUND THE BABY,

12:14.134 --> 12:16.436
THE KIDNAPPER'S IN CUSTODY,
WE'RE DONE.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.139
- BUT STILL,
CAPTAIN, COME ON.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.174
IT'S WORTH TRACKING
THIS GUY DOWN.

12:21.174 --> 12:24.778
I MEAN, JUST TO SEE
IF HE'S ON THE UP AND UP?

12:24.778 --> 12:26.980
- ALL RIGHT, ONE CONVERSATION
WITH THE LAWYER,

12:26.980 --> 12:29.783
AND THEN THIS MOVES
OFF OUR PLATE.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.253
- I COULD HAVE SAVED
YOU THE TRIP.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.988
WENDELL DIED FROM SEPSIS
A MONTH AGO.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.356
WENT IN FOR A HIP REPLACEMENT,

12:36.356 --> 12:38.225
NEVER MADE IT BACK.
- I'M SO SORRY.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.526
AND YOU WERE HIS LAW PARTNER?

12:39.526 --> 12:41.328
- 30 YEARS.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.796
- YOU KNOW, WE'RE LOOKING INTO
AN ADOPTION

12:42.796 --> 12:44.364
AND A SURROGACY,
BOTH ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.565
THE BIRTH MOTHER
WAS A DIA NOBILE.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.367
- ADOPTION?

12:47.367 --> 12:50.037
WE DON'T DO FAMILY--

12:50.037 --> 12:52.339
THAT IS HIS SIGNATURE.
IT MAKES NO SENSE.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.175
- IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WENDELL
MADE AN EXCEPTION?

12:55.175 --> 12:58.278
- MAYBE SOMEONE PASTED
HIS SIGNATURE ONTO THIS.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.313
WENDELL WAS ALWAYS BY THE BOOK.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.283
[keyboard clicking]

13:03.283 --> 13:06.253
MS. NOBILE IS NOT SHOWING
AS A CLIENT.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.088
- OKAY.

13:08.088 --> 13:13.526
CAN YOU CHECK JOSIE
AND BRAYDON LEDDY, L-E-D-D-Y?

13:13.526 --> 13:15.195
- MM, NOT THEM EITHER.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.130
- IF YOU COULD JUST CHECK
ONE MORE NAME?

13:17.130 --> 13:22.269
A SURROGATE, ERIN MURPHY.
[keyboard clicking]

13:22.269 --> 13:26.039
- OKAY, ERIN MURPHY I'VE GOT.
BUT NOT FOR A SURROGACY.

13:26.039 --> 13:30.978
A SLIP AND FALL
IN A SUPERMARKET.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.545
- ERIN MURPHY?
WE'VE LEFT MESSAGES WITH HER,

13:32.545 --> 13:35.048
BUT SHE HASN'T CALLED US BACK.
- DID YOU EVER MEET HER?

13:35.048 --> 13:37.350
- NO, SHE WAS VERY BUSY WITH
HER COLLEGE CLASSES,

13:37.350 --> 13:38.485
BUT WE SKYPED.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.054
- WE SENT TWO DETECTIVES
TO HER CAMPUS.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.290
SHE'S NO LONGER
REGISTERED THERE,

13:43.290 --> 13:45.993
AND SHE DIDN'T LEAVE
A FORWARDING ADDRESS.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.929
- WELL, MAYBE WHEN FEENEY
CALLS US BACK

13:48.929 --> 13:50.864
WE CAN FIND OUT WHERE SHE IS.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.033
- HE WON'T BE CALLING YOU BACK.
HE DIED A MONTH AGO.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.502
- WAIT, WENDELL FEENEY'S DEAD?

13:55.502 --> 13:58.238
WELL, WE DIDN'T KNOW.
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY IN TOUCH.

13:58.238 --> 14:01.141
- HOW DID YOU MEET HIM?
- HE'S A COUSIN BY MARRIAGE.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.343
HE HEARD ME TALKING
AT OUR FAMILY REUNION

14:03.343 --> 14:04.945
ABOUT MY FERTILITY ISSUES.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.881
HE OFFERED TO HELP.
- LOOK, JUST TELL US...

14:07.881 --> 14:09.416
DID FEENEY SCREW UP
THE PAPERS?

14:09.416 --> 14:14.521
- IT COULD BE MORE
THAN JUST PAPERS.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.523
WE'RE GONNA NEED DNA FROM YOU.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.092
- YOU'RE SAYING
I'M NOT TESSA'S FATHER?

14:19.092 --> 14:23.296
- LOOK, IT'S EASY
TO CONFIRM WITH A DNA TEST.

14:23.296 --> 14:28.301
- BRAYDON, JUST...DO IT.

14:28.301 --> 14:32.239
MAKE THIS GO AWAY, PLEASE.

14:38.678 --> 14:42.015
- SO ONCE THE DNA
PROVES TESSA'S MINE,

14:42.015 --> 14:44.251
I GET HER BACK, RIGHT?

14:44.251 --> 14:47.020
- HONEY, EVEN IF SHE IS
YOUR BIOLOGICAL CHILD,

14:47.020 --> 14:48.488
YOU CAN'T JUST STEAL HER.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.657
- I GOTTA ASK YOU A QUESTION.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.126
WHY'D YOU GIVE HER UP?

14:53.126 --> 14:55.929
- WELL, MY LOVER,
TESSA'S FATHER,

14:55.929 --> 14:58.565
SAID IT WOULD ONLY BE TEMPORARY,
JUST A FEW MONTHS.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.100
HIS WIFE'S DYING.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.535
SHE HAS A BRAIN TUMOR.

15:02.535 --> 15:06.206
BUT, MEANWHILE, A FEW MONTHS
TURNS INTO A YEAR,

15:06.206 --> 15:10.377
AND I MISS HER FIRST STEPS,
HER FIRST BIRTHDAY.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.712
IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH.

15:12.712 --> 15:17.117
- WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO TALK TO THE FATHER.

15:17.117 --> 15:22.022
- DIA, YOU'VE GOT
A BAIL HEARING TOMORROW.

15:22.022 --> 15:26.226
YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE
TO CONFIRM YOUR STORY.

15:26.226 --> 15:29.129
- I CAN'T.
I MEAN, HE'D BE FURIOUS.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.364
- WELL, HONEY,
IF WE CAN'T TALK TO HIM,

15:31.364 --> 15:33.300
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE TESSA.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.669
- [exhales sharply]

15:36.669 --> 15:41.941
IT'S KENT WEBSTER, THE DEAN
AT JOHN ADAMS LAW SCHOOL.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.378
- HE'S RELATED
TO THAT OLD JUDGE, RIGHT?

15:45.378 --> 15:48.348
- YEAH, CLARK'S HIS DAD.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.417
AND THE APPLE DOESN'T FALL
FAR FROM THE TREE.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.486
CLARK'S DISTINGUISHED,
BUT KENT IS GORGEOUS.

15:53.486 --> 15:58.458
WE MET WHEN I SHOT THE COVER
PHOTO FOR HIS ALUM MAGAZINE.

15:58.458 --> 16:03.330
IT WAS LUST AT FIRST SIGHT.

16:03.330 --> 16:06.099
- DIA NOBILE MADE BAIL.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.268
SHE HAS A HEALTHY BANK ACCOUNT
FOR A FREELANCER.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.670
- WELL, SHE MIGHT HAVE
A SILENT PARTNER.

16:10.670 --> 16:14.307
SHE'S CLAIMING THAT TESSA'S
FATHER IS KENT WEBSTER.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.643
- KENT WEBSTER?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.745
HE'S ON THE SHORT LIST
FOR THE SUPREME COURT,

16:18.745 --> 16:21.414
SHE'S A FORMER YOGA INSTRUCTOR.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.650
ON WHAT PLANET
DO THESE TWO CROSS PATHS?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.585
- THEY MET ON A PHOTO SHOOT.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.254
THE EDITOR WHO FIRED HER

16:27.254 --> 16:29.756
STILL HAS AN ORDER OF
PROTECTION OUT AGAINST HER.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.259
- OKAY, I MEAN, SHE'S UNSTABLE.
BUT A LOT OF GUYS LIKE DRAMA.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.194
- BREAKING NEWS.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.130
THE LEDDYS' DOCUMENTS,
DIA'S ADOPTION PAPERS,

16:37.130 --> 16:38.231
ALL FAKES.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.233
THEY WERE NEVER FILED
WITH THE COURT.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.470
- SO BABY GIRL NOBILE'S
BIRTH CERTIFICATE

16:43.470 --> 16:45.472
IS THE ONLY
LEGITIMATE DOCUMENT?

16:45.472 --> 16:49.242
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS PART OF A SCAM?

16:49.242 --> 16:52.345
FEENEY WAS THE LEDDYS' COUSIN.
ARE THEY IN ON THIS?

16:52.345 --> 16:54.281
- BRAYDON LEDDY BELIEVES
WITH ALL HIS HEART

16:54.281 --> 16:56.183
HE'S THAT LITTLE GIRL'S
FATHER.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.218
- WELL, UNTIL THE DNA COMES
BACK, WE CAN'T POINT FINGERS.

16:58.218 --> 17:01.121
- WELL, WE CAN'T,
BUT DIA HAS, RIGHT?

17:01.121 --> 17:04.257
AT KENT WEBSTER.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.326
- TREAD CAREFULLY.
BENSON, GO WITH.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.396
AND AT THE SCHOOL,
NOT HIS HOME.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.334
- DIA NOBILE.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.336
I MEET A LOT OF PEOPLE.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.072
- WELL, SHE PHOTOGRAPHED YOU
FOR ALUMNI MAGAZINE.

17:19.072 --> 17:22.275
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME?

17:22.275 --> 17:23.343
- WELL, SHE SAYS
YOU'RE THE FATHER

17:23.343 --> 17:25.345
OF HER ONE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,

17:25.345 --> 17:28.648
AND THAT YOU FORCED HER TO GIVE
THE BABY UP TO ANOTHER FAMILY.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.217
- I HARDLY KNOW THIS WOMAN.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.851
- SO YOU'RE NOT HER BABY DADDY?

17:31.851 --> 17:33.720
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I BARELY KNOW HER.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.422
- SHE KNOWS YOU.

17:35.422 --> 17:38.325
SHE KNOWS PERSONAL DETAILS
ABOUT YOUR CAREER,

17:38.325 --> 17:40.860
YOUR WIFE'S ILLNESS.
- MY FATHER'S A JUDGE.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.496
HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY
CAME OUT THIS YEAR.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.565
OUR LIVES ARE LITERALLY
AN OPEN BOOK RIGHT NOW.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.235
- EXCUSE ME, DEAN WEBSTER?

17:48.235 --> 17:49.869
- GIVE ME A SECOND?
YEAH?

17:49.869 --> 17:52.405
- A DIA NOBILE CALLED.

17:52.405 --> 17:56.609
SHE SAID SHE'LL MEET YOU
AT HOME?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.411
- YOU NEED TO HIM GO!
[sirens wailing]

17:58.411 --> 18:01.548
HE WANTS TO RAISE TESSA WITH ME.
- KENT! WHO IS THIS?

18:01.548 --> 18:03.183
- BABY, I KNEW YOU'D COME.
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

18:03.183 --> 18:04.251
- COME--
- GET--GET AWAY.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.485
- DIA, STEP BACK.
- GET AWAY!

18:05.485 --> 18:06.786
- DIA, STEP BACK!

18:06.786 --> 18:10.423
- GET THIS CRAZY WOMAN
OFF MY PROPERTY.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.426
[breathes heavily]
GO, COME ON.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.396
- KENT?

18:16.396 --> 18:19.466
- GET IN THE HOUSE.
COME ON.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.537
- COME ON.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.243
- I'M NOT A STALKER.
KENT LOVES ME.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.778
- HE'S GOT A FUNNY WAY
OF SHOWING IT.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.281
- WELL, HE HAD TO.
SHE WAS RIGHT THERE.

18:34.281 --> 18:37.350
LOOK AT HIS TEXT.
MY PHONE'S IN MY BAG.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.156
"YOU'RE THE ONLY STAR
IN MY GALAXY,"

18:43.156 --> 18:45.325
"MY HAPPIEST PLACE
IS IN YOUR GOLDEN TRIANGLE."

18:45.325 --> 18:47.394
THAT'S MY FAVORITE ONE.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.596
- AND HE SENT THESE
FROM HIS CELL?

18:49.596 --> 18:51.531
- NO, WE HAVE A PRIVATE PHONE.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.266
- SO THERE'S NO WAY
TO PROVE THEY'RE FROM HIM.

18:53.266 --> 18:56.569
- YEAH, BUT, HE SENT ME PICS
OF KING SEBASTIAN.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.272
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IT.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.573
- OKAY.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.709
- LOOK, I SWEAR,
TESS IS KENT'S.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.711
- BUT, UH, I--

19:04.711 --> 19:10.683
- I SCRATCHED HIM.
CAN YOU GET DNA FROM THAT?

19:10.683 --> 19:13.853
- HEY, GET CSU OVER HERE.
- YEAH, RIGHT AWAY.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.722
- SHE KIDNAPPED A BABY?

19:15.722 --> 19:18.925
WH--WHY IS SHE OUT ON BAIL?
- HAVE YOU HAD CONTACT WITH HER?

19:18.925 --> 19:21.694
- NO.
I MEAN, I--

19:21.694 --> 19:24.764
I CALLED HER A YEAR AGO
TO THANK HER FOR THE PHOTOS.

19:24.764 --> 19:27.234
SHE CALLED ME BACK ON MY HOME
PHONE A FEW TOO MANY TIMES,

19:27.234 --> 19:29.769
AND MY RADAR WAS UP,
AND I CHANGED THE NUMBER.

19:29.769 --> 19:33.306
- SO YOU NEVER SENT HER
ANY TEXTS?

19:33.306 --> 19:34.574
- IS THAT WHAT SHE SAID?

19:34.574 --> 19:36.976
- HOW ABOUT PICTURES?

19:36.976 --> 19:42.682
AND I DON'T MEAN OF YOUR FACE.
- SHE'S NUTS.

19:42.682 --> 19:46.753
YOU CAN CHECK MY PHONE.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.889
- SHE'S OBVIOUSLY
MAKING THE WHOLE THING UP.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.596
- I'LL--I'LL GET THAT.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.899
- HAS KENT MENTIONED
DIA BEFORE?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.901
- NO. NO, HE DOESN'T KNOW HER.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.936
- HANNAH, HAD YOU HEARD OF HER?

20:03.936 --> 20:07.740
- OF COURSE NOT.
- MOM?

20:07.740 --> 20:10.610
EH, SHE'S IN MY ZUMBA CLASS,

20:10.610 --> 20:14.414
AND I WENT OUT WITH HER
A FEW TIMES.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.749
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.418
I NEVER WOULD HAVE TALKED
TO HER.

20:18.418 --> 20:22.822
- HANNAH,
YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.725
- SHE'S RIGHT, SWEETHEART.

20:25.725 --> 20:29.362
THE WOMAN IS CRAZY.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.801
- HANNAH, WHY DON'T YOU COME
TALK TO ME FOR A SECOND?

20:40.373 --> 20:41.541
- WE HAD COFFEE
TWO OR THREE TIMES.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.943
AND THEN SHE TOLD ME
SHE KNEW MY DAD.

20:43.943 --> 20:47.814
THAT HE WAS CHARMING,
BUT EVERYBODY SAYS THAT.

20:47.814 --> 20:51.951
- SHE EVER MENTION YOUR MOM?
- THAT'S WHAT'S SO MESSED UP.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.387
I MEAN,
SHE TALKED ABOUT HER A LOT,

20:54.387 --> 20:58.057
ASKING ABOUT HER TREATMENTS
AND HOW I'M HOLDING UP.

20:58.057 --> 21:02.862
- SO SHE GOT PERSONAL
PRETTY QUICKLY.

21:02.862 --> 21:07.066
- IT'S BEEN HARD
WITH MY MOM SICK.

21:07.066 --> 21:10.670
I FELT LIKE SHE WANTED
TO BE MY BIG SISTER.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.705
- YOUR MARRIAGE IS SOLID?

21:12.705 --> 21:16.543
- WELL, IT HASN'T ALWAYS
BEEN PERFECT.

21:16.543 --> 21:21.548
BUT SINCE MY DIAGNOSIS,
KENT HAS BEEN A ROCK.

21:21.548 --> 21:22.715
CAN'T YOU GET ONE OF THOSE

21:22.715 --> 21:25.852
ORDERS OF SELECTION
TO KEEP HER AWAY?

21:25.852 --> 21:27.520
- YOU MEAN PROTECTION, HONEY.
- OH.

21:27.520 --> 21:31.558
[both chuckling]
- IT'S OKAY.

21:31.558 --> 21:35.728
- IT'S MY CONDITION.
THE WORDS GET SCRAMBLED.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.731
- I UNDERSTAND.
- IF WE GET AN O.O.P.,

21:38.731 --> 21:40.600
THAT'S PUBLIC.

21:40.600 --> 21:44.637
REPORTERS OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.
YOU DON'T NEED THAT.

21:44.637 --> 21:49.108
YOU TELL THE NUTCASE, SHE COMES
ANYWHERE NEAR MY FAMILY,

21:49.108 --> 21:52.379
WE'LL PRESS CHARGES.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.749
- SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG,

21:56.749 --> 22:01.020
BUT CUSTODY DISPUTES ARE NOT
A PRIORITY AROUND HERE.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.555
- WELL, THIS COULD BE
MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.457
- I DON'T HAVE
ALL THE ANSWERS YET,

22:04.457 --> 22:08.895
BUT DIA NOBILE
IS TESSA'S BIOLOGICAL MOTHER.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.597
THE DNA'S A MATCH.
- SO SHE WAS TELLING

22:10.597 --> 22:12.665
THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT.
WHO'S THE FATHER?

22:12.665 --> 22:15.568
- YOU CAN RULE OUT
BRAYDON LEDDY.

22:15.568 --> 22:18.037
- THAT'S GONNA BE A DIFFICULT
CONVERSATION TO HAVE.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.539
AND KENT WEBSTER?

22:19.539 --> 22:21.140
- SHE SCRATCHED HIM UP
PRETTY GOOD, AND WE HAVE

22:21.140 --> 22:22.875
MORE THAN ENOUGH DNA, BUT...

22:22.875 --> 22:25.445
AGAIN, IT'S NOT AT
THE TOP OF THE WORK LIST.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.913
- IS THERE ANY WAY
TO HURRY THAT UP?

22:26.913 --> 22:28.715
'CAUSE DIA'S CLAIMING
THAT KENT TRICKED HER

22:28.715 --> 22:30.450
INTO GIVING UP
THEIR LOVE CHILD.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.884
- AND THE LEDDYS WERE TRICKED
INTO BELIEVING

22:31.884 --> 22:33.686
THAT BABY TESSA
CAME TO THEM

22:33.686 --> 22:35.688
THROUGH A SURROGATE.
- YOU DO KNOW,

22:35.688 --> 22:39.125
EVEN IF IT TURNS OUT THAT KENT
IS THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER,

22:39.125 --> 22:41.027
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN PROVE
HE KNEW ABOUT THE BABY.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.862
- OH, HE KNEW.
I MEAN, COME ON,

22:42.862 --> 22:45.932
THE SEXTING, THE BURNER CELL.
HE KNOCKED UP HIS MISTRESS,

22:45.932 --> 22:48.668
AND THEN DUMMIED UP A BUNCH OF
LEGAL PAPERS TO KEEP HER QUIET.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.403
HE'S A SOCIOPATH.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.938
- HE TOLD HER THAT
THIS WOULD BE RESOLVED

22:51.938 --> 22:54.941
WITHIN A YEAR, AND NOW
SHE'S TRYING TO REMIND HIM.

22:54.941 --> 23:00.112
- YOU KNOW, KENT DID SEND HER
PHOTOS OF HIS "KING."

23:00.112 --> 23:01.848
ANY WAY TO VERIFY?

23:01.848 --> 23:03.983
- NOT WITHOUT SEEING
THE ORIGINAL IN A SIMILAR STATE.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.952
YOU WANT TO ASK
FOR THAT SUBPOENA?

23:05.952 --> 23:08.655
- HOW LONG FOR THE DNA?

23:08.655 --> 23:11.023
- YOU SURE IT'S HIS?

23:11.023 --> 23:13.626
BLUFF HIM.

23:13.626 --> 23:18.030
- I'M THE FATHER?

23:18.030 --> 23:19.499
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.033
- DNA DOESN'T LIE.

23:21.033 --> 23:26.673
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO CAREFULLY
CONSIDER YOUR ANSWER, COUNSELOR.

23:26.673 --> 23:30.209
- OKAY.

23:30.209 --> 23:33.145
THERE IS ONE POSSIBILITY.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.682
- YEAH, WE FIGURED THAT.

23:35.682 --> 23:41.120
- AFTER THE PHOTO SHOOT,
I WAS, UH, TENSE.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.122
DIA MASSAGED MY SHOULDERS.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.224
WE WERE ALONE IN THE ROOM,

23:45.224 --> 23:50.196
AND I-I GOT AROUSED.

23:50.196 --> 23:53.566
MY WIFE HAS BEEN ILL, AND I--

23:53.566 --> 23:55.602
THIS IS
INCREDIBLY EMBARRASSING.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.804
- GO ON.

23:57.804 --> 24:01.040
- IN A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS,

24:01.040 --> 24:04.210
I LET HER GIVE ME...

24:04.210 --> 24:08.247
A MANUAL RELEASE.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.549
YOU CAN SEE HOW
I DIDN'T THINK THAT COULD

24:09.549 --> 24:12.719
IN ANY WAY FATHER A CHILD.

24:12.719 --> 24:14.020
- JUST TO BE CLEAR,
YOU'RE SAYING THAT

24:14.020 --> 24:16.923
DIA RETRIEVED YOUR SEMEN,

24:16.923 --> 24:19.626
AND THEN USED IT
TO IMPREGNATE HERSELF?

24:19.626 --> 24:21.193
- YOU SEE HER DO THAT?

24:21.193 --> 24:23.563
- NO, I-I--WHEN IT WAS OVER,
I LEFT THE ROOM.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.532
IMM--IMMEDIATELY.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.233
YOU CAN APPRECIATE
THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING

24:27.233 --> 24:28.735
THAT I WANT MADE PUBLIC.

24:28.735 --> 24:30.637
- OR YOUR WIFE TO FIND OUT.

24:30.637 --> 24:33.139
OKAY.
SO ONE MORE QUESTION, COUNSELOR.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.007
HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW
WENDELL FEENEY?

24:35.007 --> 24:36.275
- I DON'T THINK
I KNOW WHO THAT IS.

24:36.275 --> 24:38.210
- NO?
WELL HE FAKED

24:38.210 --> 24:40.547
THE ADOPTION PAPERS
FOR DIA'S BABY.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.682
HE FAKED A SURROGACY AGREEMENT

24:42.682 --> 24:44.717
TO PLACE THE BABY
WITH THE LEDDYS.

24:44.717 --> 24:48.921
- I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

24:48.921 --> 24:52.692
DIA DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME
SHE WAS PREGNANT.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.627
- HE GAVE THE SAMPLE
AT THE CLINIC.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.963
YOU CAN--
YOU CAN CHECK THE SHIPPING.

24:56.963 --> 24:59.666
TESSA HAS BRAYDON'S FAIR SKIN,
AND HIS SMILE.

24:59.666 --> 25:02.635
LOOK AT HIS BABY PICTURES.
THIS IS A MISTAKE.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.537
- I'M SORRY.

25:04.537 --> 25:07.540
AND YOUR SURROGATE,
ERIN MURPHY?

25:07.540 --> 25:10.176
SHE DIDN'T GIVE BIRTH TO TESSA.
DIA NOBILE DID.

25:10.176 --> 25:13.780
- OH, MY GOD.

25:13.780 --> 25:17.049
- NO. WAIT, WAIT.

25:17.049 --> 25:20.052
FEENEY TOLD ME
HE HANDLED EVERYTHING.

25:20.052 --> 25:24.724
HE TOLD ME TESSA
IS OUR CHILD.

25:24.724 --> 25:27.760
SHE IS OUR CHILD.
- DO YOU REALLY THINK

25:27.760 --> 25:33.833
THEY WOULD GIVE OUR DAUGHTER
TO THAT WOMAN WHO KIDNAPPED HER?

25:33.833 --> 25:36.569
- THAT'S UP TO THE COURT.

25:36.569 --> 25:41.073
LOOK, YOU HAVE RAISED TESSA
SINCE BIRTH.

25:41.073 --> 25:44.076
I ADVISE GETTING THE BEST LAWYER
YOU CAN AFFORD.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.721
- DETECTIVES, I UNDERSTAND
MR. FEENEY IS DECEASED?

25:54.721 --> 25:55.822
- YES, YOUR HONOR.

25:55.822 --> 25:58.024
- CAN ANYONE IN HIS FIRM
HELP US?

25:58.024 --> 26:00.793
- NO, THESE JOBS
WERE OFF THEIR BOOKS.

26:00.793 --> 26:03.129
WE SEARCHED HIS HOME AND OFFICE.
THERE'S NO PAPER TRAIL.

26:03.129 --> 26:06.799
- OKAY.
WE HAVE A WOMAN WHO GAVE UP,

26:06.799 --> 26:09.068
THEN KIDNAPPED
HER OWN BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER.

26:09.068 --> 26:12.338
WE HAVE CUSTODIAL PARENTS
WITH FRAUDULENT PAPERS.

26:12.338 --> 26:13.873
- THERE'S NO EVIDENCE MY CLIENTS

26:13.873 --> 26:15.141
WERE AWARE OF THE FRAUD,
YOUR HONOR.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.610
- OBJECTION!
THE LAWYER WAS THEIR COUSIN.

26:17.610 --> 26:19.612
- SIT DOWN, MS. NOBILE.
- WE'RE SORRY, YOUR HONOR,

26:19.612 --> 26:21.147
BUT WENDELL FEENEY
WAS RELATED TO THE LEDDYS.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.849
HE DECEIVED MS. NOBILE

26:22.849 --> 26:25.885
INTO BELIEVING THEY WOULD
ONLY HAVE TEMPORARY CUSTODY.

26:25.885 --> 26:26.986
- YEAH, THEY BOUGHT TESSA,
AND TRIED TO COVER IT UP

26:26.986 --> 26:28.354
BY PRETENDING
TO HAVE A SURROGATE.

26:28.354 --> 26:29.856
- NO, HOW DARE YOU!

26:29.856 --> 26:32.224
THIS--[grunts].
WE WERE LIED TO!

26:32.224 --> 26:34.193
THIS WOMAN,
SHE KIDNAPPED OUR CHILD.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.962
- ENOUGH.
[gavel banging]

26:35.962 --> 26:37.329
ALL OF YOU.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.165
MS. NOBILE, WHETHER OR NOT

26:39.165 --> 26:41.367
THE LEDDYS WERE
IN LEAGUE WITH MR. FEENEY,

26:41.367 --> 26:43.936
YOU ALSO USED MR. FEENEY
AS YOUR LAWYER.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.639
YOU SIGNED AWAY
YOUR PARENTAL RIGHTS.

26:46.639 --> 26:49.942
HOW DID YOU COME
TO HIRE MR. FEENEY?

26:49.942 --> 26:52.078
- IN ORDER TO PROTECT
THE PRIVACY OF THE FATHER,

26:52.078 --> 26:53.846
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT, YOUR HONOR.
- ARE YOU REALLY

26:53.846 --> 26:56.182
JUST GOING TO ACCEPT THAT?
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

26:56.182 --> 26:59.418
- ENOUGH, MR. LEDDY.
THIS IS A DIFFICULT DECISION.

26:59.418 --> 27:01.921
I KNOW YOU'VE RAISED TESSA
WITH CARE AND LOVE.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.723
- THEY BOTH WORK!

27:03.723 --> 27:05.391
THEY WEREN'T EVEN WATCHING HER
IN THE PARK.

27:05.391 --> 27:08.027
- I WON'T WARN YOU AGAIN,
MS. NOBILE.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.763
BUT GIVEN THAT MR. FEENEY WAS
A RELATIVE OF YOURS,

27:10.763 --> 27:14.400
I NEED FURTHER ASSURANCE THAT
YOU HAVE NO CULPABILITY.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.403
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'M SIGNING A TEMPORARY ORDER

27:17.403 --> 27:20.773
THAT TESSA LEDDY BE REMANDED
TO THE A.C.S.

27:20.773 --> 27:22.775
PENDING A FINAL CUSTODY HEARING.

27:22.775 --> 27:25.277
- PLEASE, PLEASE, NO.
- NO. SHE'S OURS.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.346
- SHE IS MINE!
- YOU'RE A CRAZY BITCH!

27:27.346 --> 27:29.015
- BRAYDON, NOT IN FRONT
OF THE JUDGE.

27:29.015 --> 27:30.883
- I'M SORRY, I'LL HAVE
TO ASK THE A.C.S OFFICER

27:30.883 --> 27:32.218
TO TAKE CUSTODY.
- NO--NOW?

27:32.218 --> 27:33.953
- NO, NO, NO.
- PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.822
- JOSIE, JOSIE, JOSIE.
- PLEASE, NO, YOU CAN'T.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.690
- IT'S OKAY, LOOK, JOSIE.
- YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE HER AWAY.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.892
PLEASE, DON'T TAKE HER FROM ME.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS, PLEASE.

27:39.892 --> 27:42.962
[Tessa crying]
- IT'S OKAY, BABY.

27:50.302 --> 27:54.941
[sobbing]
- IT'S OKAY.

27:54.941 --> 27:57.109
NOW WHAT?
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

27:57.109 --> 27:59.311
- YOU PROVE THAT YOU WEREN'T
COMPLICIT IN THE FRAUD.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.881
- HOW? HOW DO WE PROVE
THAT FEENEY LIED TO US?

28:01.881 --> 28:04.717
- DID FEENEY EVER MENTION
KENT WEBSTER?

28:04.717 --> 28:06.152
- NO, NEVER.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.287
- YOU EVER SEE HIS NAME
ON PAPERWORK?

28:08.287 --> 28:10.990
MAYBE A NOTATION IN THE FILE?

28:10.990 --> 28:13.392
OVERHEAR A PHONE CALL?

28:13.392 --> 28:15.928
- THE SUNDAY THAT WE PICKED
TESSA UP FROM FEENEY'S OFFICE,

28:15.928 --> 28:17.930
HE DID CALL SOMEONE.

28:17.930 --> 28:21.000
- RIGHT, IT WAS QUICK.
JUST, "IT'S DONE, YOUR HONOR."

28:21.000 --> 28:23.069
- "YOUR HONOR."

28:27.206 --> 28:28.975
- DETECTIVES, CAN'T THIS WAIT?

28:28.975 --> 28:31.243
IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.
- NO, IT CAN'T.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.913
WE NEED TO ASK YOU SOME
QUESTIONS ABOUT WENDELL FEENEY.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.848
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
I DON'T KNOW HIM.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.216
- MAYBE.
DID YOU KNOW YOUR FATHER,

28:37.216 --> 28:39.151
JUDGE CLARK WEBSTER,
KNEW FEENEY?

28:39.151 --> 28:40.853
- EXCUSE ME?
- YEAH.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.922
THE NIGHT THAT THE LEDDYS
PICKED UP TESSA FROM FEENEY,

28:42.922 --> 28:45.024
HE MADE A CALL TO THE JUDGE.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.759
- YEAH, WE DID SOME CHECKING.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.160
IT TURNS OUT FEENEY'S
FIRST YEAR OUT OF LAW SCHOOL,

28:48.160 --> 28:50.897
HE WAS UP ON A FELONY CHARGE,
FACING DISBARMENT.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.531
AND YOUR FATHER VACATED
THE JUDGMENT.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.233
SAVED FEENEY'S CAREER.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.202
- YOUR FATHER CLEANED UP
FEENEY'S MESS.

28:56.202 --> 28:59.038
AND 30 YEARS LATER,
HE'S CLEANING UP YOURS.

28:59.038 --> 29:00.306
- DID MS. NOBILE TELL YOU
THIS FANTASY?

29:00.306 --> 29:02.474
FEEL FREE TO ASK MY FATHER.

29:02.474 --> 29:06.478
- OH, WE INTEND TO.
UNDER OATH.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.314
- GOOD NIGHT, DETECTIVES.

29:08.314 --> 29:09.548
NOW THAT YOU'VE RUINED
OUR DINNER,

29:09.548 --> 29:11.217
CAN YOU LEAVE US IN PEACE?

29:11.217 --> 29:13.552
- DADDY?
- WHAT HONEY?

29:13.552 --> 29:15.988
- TELL ME THIS CAN'T BE TRUE.
- WHAT?

29:15.988 --> 29:18.224
- YOU WERE WITH HER TODAY?
KISSING HER?

29:18.224 --> 29:20.559
- OKAY, HONEY, LET ME JUST--
HERE, LET ME JUST--YEAH--

29:20.559 --> 29:22.228
[struggling]

29:22.228 --> 29:23.896
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- HONEY, NO--

29:23.896 --> 29:28.901
- GET OFF ME!
- WHAT?

29:28.901 --> 29:32.271
TH--THIS IS FROM TODAY.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.373
THIS IS YOUR ONE-TIME MISTAKE?
- GILLIAN...

29:34.373 --> 29:35.875
NOT HERE, OKAY?
I CAN EXPLAIN.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.143
- YOU BASTARD.
HOW COULD YOU?

29:37.143 --> 29:38.544
- THIS IS NOT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.847
- THIS IS EXACTLY HOW IT LOOKS.
- HONEY, HONEY--

29:40.847 --> 29:42.849
- OH, THAT'S WHY THAT WHORE
CAME TO OUR HOUSE?

29:42.849 --> 29:45.151
YOU WERE SCREWING HER
THIS WHOLE TIME?

29:45.151 --> 29:46.385
YOU WERE SCREWING HER
IN OUR HOUSE

29:46.385 --> 29:48.154
WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL!
- MS. WEBSTER.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.288
MS. WEBSTER, PLEASE.

29:49.288 --> 29:52.158
- YOU HAD A BABY WITH HER!

30:04.303 --> 30:06.873
- NOW WE KNOW
HOW THEY GOT THESE PICTURES.

30:06.873 --> 30:10.142
DIA CALLED THE PAPARAZZI
ON HERSELF.

30:10.142 --> 30:13.345
UGH, LMZ GOT AN ANONYMOUS TIP
FROM A FEMALE SAYING

30:13.345 --> 30:15.948
THAT KENT WEBSTER WAS MEETING
HIS MISTRESS AT A HOTEL.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.884
- DIA KNEW THAT HE WAS GOING OUT
FOR HIS ANNIVERSARY,

30:17.884 --> 30:19.218
SO SHE WANTED TO PUNISH HIM.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.887
- BUT NONE OF THIS PROVES
KENT SET UP

30:20.887 --> 30:22.922
THE FRAUDULENT PLACEMENT
OF TESSA.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.256
- WELL, IF HE DIDN'T DO IT,
HIS FATHER DID.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.992
WHEN DO WE GET TO TALK
TO THE JUDGE?

30:25.992 --> 30:28.160
- WELL, IT'S TOO LATE.
AN HOUR AGO,

30:28.160 --> 30:30.963
THE ESTEEMED JUDGE CLARK WEBSTER
WENT INTO THE D.A.'S OFFICE

30:30.963 --> 30:33.565
AND LIED UNDER OATH
TO HIS ASSOCIATES.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.902
HE SWORE THAT HE HADN'T SPOKEN
TO FEENEY IN OVER A DECADE.

30:35.902 --> 30:38.971
- AND THEY BELIEVED HIM?
- A LOCAL PRECINCT JUST GOT

30:38.971 --> 30:42.008
A REPORT OF A DOMESTIC
DISTURBANCE AT DIA'S LOFT.

30:42.008 --> 30:45.477
- TELL THEM WE'LL HANDLE IT.

30:45.477 --> 30:48.547
[shuffling, rummaging]

30:52.518 --> 30:54.286
- TURN AROUND.
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS.

30:54.286 --> 30:56.989
- DETECTIVES, DIA--
DIA'S BEEN MURDERED.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.524
- GET YOUR HANDS UP WHERE
I CAN SEE THEM!

30:58.524 --> 30:59.959
- YOU CAN'T THINK
THAT I DID THIS.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.894
- YES, WE CAN.
GET YOUR HANDS UP!

31:01.894 --> 31:03.963
GET 'EM UP!

31:11.203 --> 31:13.039
- AGAIN, SHE WAS DEAD
WHEN I GOT THERE.

31:13.039 --> 31:15.041
- "SHE"?
YOU MEAN YOUR LOVER, DIA.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.542
- WHAT TIME?

31:16.542 --> 31:18.577
- MAYBE FIVE MINUTES
BEFORE YOU ARRIVED.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.046
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?

31:20.046 --> 31:22.581
- I WAS UPSET
ABOUT HER HARASSMENT.

31:22.581 --> 31:25.351
I WENT TO TALK TO HER.
- WELL, WHEN YOU SAW THAT SHE

31:25.351 --> 31:27.419
WASN'T REALLY HOLDING UP
HER END OF THE CONVERSATION,

31:27.419 --> 31:29.922
WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL THE POLICE?

31:29.922 --> 31:33.092
- I WAS ABOUT TO.
- SO IT MUST'VE BEEN YOUR PHONE

31:33.092 --> 31:37.129
THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR
IN HER DESK DRAWER.

31:37.129 --> 31:39.966
- PERSONAL ITEMS
I WANTED TO RETRIEVE.

31:39.966 --> 31:45.671
- WHILE SHE WAS BLEEDING OUT.
WHAT COULD BE SO IMPORTANT?

31:45.671 --> 31:47.073
- SEX TAPES.

31:47.073 --> 31:50.943
DIA CALLED AND SAID
SHE WOULD LEAK THEM.

31:50.943 --> 31:55.347
HE CAN'T HURT ME ANYMORE,
BUT FOR HANNAH, I-I...

31:55.347 --> 31:58.951
I BEGGED KENT TO CALL HER,
GET HER TO CHANGE HER MIND.

31:58.951 --> 32:01.187
- WHAT TIME DID DIA CALL?

32:01.187 --> 32:05.424
- 3:00.
I DIDN'T CHECK THE BLOCK.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.026
CLOCK! CLOCK.
- OKAY.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.996
AND KENT AGREED
TO TALK TO DIA?

32:09.996 --> 32:14.133
- I HAVE NEVER HEARD HIM
SO ANGRY.

32:17.003 --> 32:20.039
- GILLIAN SAID DIA CALLED
THE HOUSE AT 3:00?

32:20.039 --> 32:23.175
SHE'S CONFUSED, THE TUMOR.
IT WAS 6:00.

32:23.175 --> 32:26.012
- YOU SURE?
- YEAH, I WAS IN MY CLUB,

32:26.012 --> 32:28.347
LOCKER ROOM.
LOCAL NEWS CAME ON.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.016
- 'CAUSE THE THING IS,
COUNSELOR?

32:30.016 --> 32:31.583
WE HAVE
A FIVE MINUTE PHONE CALL

32:31.583 --> 32:34.186
FROM DIA'S LANDLINE
TO YOURS AT 3:00 P.M.

32:34.186 --> 32:39.458
- I WAS STILL IN MY OFFICE.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.161
LISTEN...

32:42.161 --> 32:45.764
MY WIFE CALLED ME
AT 6:00.

32:45.764 --> 32:48.667
SHE TOLD ME THAT DIA
WAS THREATENING

32:48.667 --> 32:50.336
TO RELEASE A SEX TAPE.

32:50.336 --> 32:54.006
- LET ME SEE YOUR CELL PHONE.

32:54.006 --> 32:56.475
- SHE WAS DEAD WHEN I GOT THERE.

32:56.475 --> 32:59.045
SOMEONE SET ME UP.

32:59.045 --> 33:01.713
- SERIOUSLY? WHO?

33:01.713 --> 33:07.519
- I DON'T KNOW.

33:07.519 --> 33:11.023
I NEED TO TALK TO MY WIFE.

33:11.023 --> 33:13.492
- COULD HAVE CALLED
HIS OWN CELL.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.161
- OR HIS WIFE WAITED
THREE HOURS TO CALL.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.728
IT GIVES HER ENOUGH TIME.

33:16.728 --> 33:19.731
- THE WOMAN IS GRAVELY ILL.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

33:19.731 --> 33:21.200
- JUST THAT WE SHOULD
GO BACK TO HER.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.036
- BEFORE YOU DO,
CHECK HIS ALIBI,

33:24.036 --> 33:27.773
AND SEE WHERE WARNER IS
ON THE TIMELINE.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.241
- I COULDN'T LIFT ANY PRINTS
OFF THE HEALING CRYSTAL,

33:29.241 --> 33:31.110
BUT IT IS THE MURDER WEAPON.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.279
20 POUNDS, MULTIPLE BLOWS.

33:33.279 --> 33:35.614
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA WITH
DEPRESSED SKULL FRACTURES.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.249
- CAN YOU PIN DOWN A TIME?

33:37.249 --> 33:39.685
- RECTAL TEMPERATURE
AT 8:00 P.M. WAS 94 DEGREES,

33:39.685 --> 33:41.220
SO SOMETIME BETWEEN
3:00 AND 5:00.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.389
- NOT 6:00?
- WARM DAY?

33:43.389 --> 33:47.493
BODY WOULDN'T HAVE COOLED
THAT FAST.

33:47.493 --> 33:49.561
- KENT'S ALIBI CHECKED OUT.

33:49.561 --> 33:52.098
CAMPUS SECURITY PUTS HIM
IN HIS OFFICE TILL 4:00.

33:52.098 --> 33:54.766
CLUB CONFIRMS HE WAS THERE
FROM 5:00 TO 6:00.

33:54.766 --> 33:56.702
- WELL, IT DOES GIVE HIM
A LITTLE WINDOW.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.337
- WHAT, SO HE KILLS HER AT 4:30

33:58.337 --> 34:00.339
AND COMES BACK TO
THE CRIME SCENE TWO HOURS LATER?

34:00.339 --> 34:02.074
- I'D LIKE TO THINK
HE'S SMARTER THAN THAT.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.209
- WELL, MAYBE HE IS.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.077
I GOT AN AUDIO FILE
OF THE 911 CALL?

34:05.077 --> 34:09.848
ANONYMOUS, FROM A PAYPHONE,
AT 6:10.

34:09.848 --> 34:12.118
TELL ME IF I'M CRAZY.
- SCREAMS COMING FROM

34:12.118 --> 34:14.686
245 VANDAM, TOP FLOOR.

34:14.686 --> 34:17.756
I-I THINK SOMEONE'S BEING SKIRT.
- MA'AM?

34:17.756 --> 34:20.859
- UH, YES, HURT.
I THINK SOMEONE'S BEING HURT.

34:20.859 --> 34:23.129
- NOT SO ANONYMOUS.

34:23.129 --> 34:24.363
- TOP FLOOR.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.598
I-I THINK SOMEONE'S BEING SKIRT.
- MA'AM?

34:26.598 --> 34:28.767
- UH, YES, HURT.
I THINK SOMEONE'S BEING--

34:28.767 --> 34:31.803
- WE CAN HAVE A VOICE ANALYSIS
DONE, BUT THAT'S YOU,

34:31.803 --> 34:34.273
ISN'T IT MRS. WEBSTER?

34:34.273 --> 34:36.108
- [pops lips]
- MRS. WEBSTER?

34:36.108 --> 34:41.347
MRS. WEBSTER, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
MRS. WEBSTER!

34:41.347 --> 34:44.816
- HEY, WE NEED AN AMBULANCE!

34:44.816 --> 34:47.786
- [sighs] SO THE DOCTOR SAYS
SHE HAD A FOCAL SEIZURE,

34:47.786 --> 34:49.755
WHICH IS COMMON
FOR HER KIND OF BRAIN TUMOR.

34:49.755 --> 34:53.825
HE SAID WE CAN TALK TO HER,
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

34:59.198 --> 35:02.701
MRS. WEBSTER.
- DON'T CALL ME THAT, PLEASE.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.771
- OKAY.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.140
LOOK, IF YOU'RE FEELING
UP TO IT, WE'D LIKE TO

35:08.140 --> 35:09.675
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.

35:09.675 --> 35:13.579
- OH, HONEY, GET ME SOME JUICE.
- HOLD UP A SECOND, HANNAH.

35:13.579 --> 35:16.815
UM, CAN YOU TELL US WHERE YOU
WENT YESTERDAY AFTER SCHOOL?

35:16.815 --> 35:20.919
- I CAME HOME.
- TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

35:20.919 --> 35:23.889
- ALL AFTERNOON?

35:23.889 --> 35:26.325
- YES.
- WELL, HOW ABOUT YOUR MOM?

35:26.325 --> 35:29.761
WAS SHE HOME ALL AFTERNOON TOO?
- MOM?

35:29.761 --> 35:31.763
- YEAH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
ANSWER THAT.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.499
YOU GO AHEAD OUT
INTO THE WAITING ROOM.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.567
GO, DARLING.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.874
SHE'S TRYING TO PROTECT ME.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.376
IT'S--IT'S NOT FAIR TO HER.

35:44.376 --> 35:45.877
- HOW DO YOU MEAN?

35:45.877 --> 35:48.847
- DIA DID CALL ME
AT 3:00 YESTERDAY.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.916
- TO TELL YOU
ABOUT THE SEX TAPE.

35:50.916 --> 35:54.220
- TO GLOAT.
SHE--

35:54.220 --> 35:58.857
I TOLD HER THAT I-I WANTED
TO TALK TO HER.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.892
SHE TOLD ME
TO COME TO HER PLACE.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.895
- AND YOU THOUGHT
YOU COULD REASON WITH HER?

36:03.895 --> 36:07.766
- CRAZY, I KNOW.
SHE'S DRIVEN ME CRAZY.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.201
WHEN I GOT THERE,

36:09.201 --> 36:12.371
I-I BEGGED HER
TO LEAVE MY FAMILY ALONE.

36:12.371 --> 36:13.905
SHE JUST LAUGHED IN MY FACE.

36:13.905 --> 36:17.943
SHE--SHE TOLD ME THAT SOON
SHE WOULD BE KENT'S WIFE,

36:17.943 --> 36:20.246
AND HANNAH'S NEW MOM.

36:20.246 --> 36:23.649
AND I-I JUST LOST IT.
I PICKED UP THE

36:23.649 --> 36:27.919
CRYSTAL, AND I--
[sighs]

36:27.919 --> 36:32.991
[groans]
I'M NOT SORRY.

36:32.991 --> 36:35.394
I WENT HOME AND I TOOK A NAP,

36:35.394 --> 36:39.498
AND...HANNAH WOKE ME
FOR DINNER.

36:39.498 --> 36:42.501
I CALLED KENT AND I TOLD HIM
TO GO TO THE LOFT.

36:42.501 --> 36:43.969
- AND THEN YOU CALLED 911.

36:43.969 --> 36:49.808
- I WAS SO ANGRY WITH HIM.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.477
- GILLIAN,
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE REASON

36:51.477 --> 36:54.980
TO BE ANGRY WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

36:54.980 --> 36:59.885
BUT I NOTICED THE OTHER DAY...

37:02.888 --> 37:05.924
THAT YOU COULDN'T PICK UP
THE WATER PITCHER.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.960
I MEAN, MY PARTNER
HAD TO DO IT FOR YOU, RIGHT?

37:08.960 --> 37:13.699
- WELL, I HAVE
GOOD DAYS AND BAD.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.867
- WELL, THE CRYSTAL,
THE MURDER WEAPON,

37:15.867 --> 37:19.938
HOW BIG WAS IT?

37:19.938 --> 37:22.007
TWICE AS HEAVY
AS THAT PITCHER.

37:22.007 --> 37:25.877
- ANGER GAVE ME STRENGTH.
- GILLIAN...

37:25.877 --> 37:30.849
WE SAW HANNAH'S HURT.

37:30.849 --> 37:34.320
SHE'S BEEN BY YOUR SIDE
THROUGH THIS WHOLE THING.

37:37.856 --> 37:40.726
- DID SHE CALL YOU FROM DIA'S?

37:40.726 --> 37:44.396
- NO. NO, DIA DID.
I TOLD YOU THAT.

37:44.396 --> 37:46.932
- DIA DIDN'T HAVE
YOUR HOME NUMBER.

37:46.932 --> 37:47.999
KENT CHANGED IT.

37:47.999 --> 37:53.004
FOR HIS OWN SAKE, REMEMBER?

37:53.004 --> 37:54.606
- GILLIAN...

37:54.606 --> 37:58.644
IF HANNAH CONFRONTED DIA,

37:58.644 --> 38:04.650
A JURY WILL UNDERSTAND
HER EMOTIONAL STATE.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.918
- WOULD THEY?

38:06.918 --> 38:11.056
A JURY WOULD UNDERSTAND
A 15-YEAR-OLD

38:11.056 --> 38:13.525
BEING INVITED OVER THERE
FOR AN APOLOGY,

38:13.525 --> 38:17.796
AND INSTEAD BEING SHOWN
A HOME-MADE SEX VIDEO,

38:17.796 --> 38:21.633
SO SHE COULD UNDERSTAND
HOW TRULY BEAUTIFUL

38:21.633 --> 38:23.902
THEIR LOVEMAKING WAS?

38:23.902 --> 38:25.637
- BUT IF THAT'S HOW
THIS WENT DOWN--

38:25.637 --> 38:29.007
- NO, NO.
IT DIDN'T.

38:34.346 --> 38:37.949
PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK
ABOUT THE JOY.

38:37.949 --> 38:42.087
THEY SAY, "HOW SAD IT WILL BE
THAT YOU'LL MISS HER--

38:42.087 --> 38:46.358
HER FIRST KISS, HER WEDDING."

38:49.928 --> 38:54.466
WHAT PARENTS REALLY WANT IS...

38:54.466 --> 38:56.668
TO PROTECT THEIR CHILD.

39:00.406 --> 39:02.941
I'M--I'M BEGGING YOU,

39:02.941 --> 39:06.812
LET ME PROTECT MY CHILD.

39:06.812 --> 39:10.716
IT'S THE LAST THING
THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO DO FOR HER.

39:12.618 --> 39:14.686
PLEASE?

39:53.992 --> 39:55.160
- HANNAH.
- I NEED TO GIVE

39:55.160 --> 39:57.496
MY MOM HER JUICE.
- JUST A COUPLE THINGS--

39:57.496 --> 40:01.900
- SHE NEEDS ME.

40:01.900 --> 40:05.003
I'M SORRY.

40:34.833 --> 40:39.871
- GILLIAN HAS MADE SURE
THAT HANNAH GETS COUNSELING.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.541
FOR EVERYTHING.

40:42.541 --> 40:47.613
THE COUNSELOR
IS GONNA REPORT DIRECTLY TO ME.

40:50.549 --> 40:54.920
NICK, I CAN DO THIS ON MY OWN.
IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS--

40:54.920 --> 40:59.057
- SO...
GILLIAN'S CONFESSION.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.827
SHE RAISED THAT HEAVY CRYSTAL

41:01.827 --> 41:03.995
AND REPEATEDLY STRUCK
DIA'S HEAD?

41:03.995 --> 41:05.931
- MOTHERS HAVE BEEN KNOWN
TO LIFT A CAR

41:05.931 --> 41:07.533
WHEN THEIR ADRENALINE'S
PUMPING.

41:07.533 --> 41:09.868
- HAVE WE RULED OUT
OTHER SUSPECTS?

41:09.868 --> 41:11.136
HER DAUGHTER, WHERE WAS SHE?

41:11.136 --> 41:17.008
- HOME, ALL AFTERNOON,
LOCKED IN.

41:18.076 --> 41:21.146
[door opens, closes]

41:29.655 --> 41:31.990
- GILLIAN WEBSTER...

41:31.990 --> 41:33.659
FOR THE CRIME OF

41:33.659 --> 41:35.994
MANSLAUGHTER IN THE FIRST
DEGREE, HOW DO YOU PLEAD?

41:35.994 --> 41:37.663
- GUILTY.

41:37.663 --> 41:40.065
- BAILIFF, TAKE THE DEFENDANT
INTO CUSTODY.

41:40.065 --> 41:43.569
- MOMMY, NO!

41:43.569 --> 41:47.773
- SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.908
- [sniffles]
