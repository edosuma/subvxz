My guest is commentator,
G. Gordon Godfrey.

00:57.470 --> 00:59.071
Sir, you've
written an editorial

00:59.073 --> 01:01.907
in which you call on us
to reject so-called "Supers,"

01:01.909 --> 01:05.144
(CHUCKLES) and effectively
become our own heroes.

01:05.146 --> 01:07.244

But, Cat, the point of
my editorial

02:17.384 --> 02:19.851
is to say that
it's time for human beings

02:19.853 --> 02:22.388
to stop relying on
Leagues and Titans,

02:22.390 --> 02:25.023
and start saving ourselves.

02:25.025 --> 02:27.591

be our own Superman?

to "Re-tweets."

think there's a sports angle here.

reminds me that he isn't.

06:21.195 --> 06:22.960
I wanted to.

I'm just glad
he finally fessed up.

to keep from you.

- Oh, honey...

I just...
I can't believe he's gone.

watch that damn Grant woman.

What if one of them
really is Clark reborn?

06:56.296 --> 06:58.196
Not possible.

06:58.198 --> 06:59.729
I would know.

06:59.731 --> 07:02.301
Of course. I just mean...

07:02.303 --> 07:04.738
There are a lot of
unanswered questions.

07:06.238 --> 07:08.773
When Superman first
showed up in Metropolis,

07:08.775 --> 07:10.275
nobody knew
what to make of him,

07:10.277 --> 07:12.313
because nobody knew
what to ask him.

07:13.947 --> 07:15.316
I knew what to ask him.

07:17.717 --> 07:19.686

finally told you everything.

07:58.258 --> 07:59.793

08:01.693 --> 08:03.427
I'm sorry. For an Amazon,

08:03.429 --> 08:06.563
I have surprisingly
few girl friends here.

08:06.565 --> 08:08.532

It's okay. I don't have
many girl friends either.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.439
Anyway, the reason
I called is that

08:15.441 --> 08:17.874
I'm following the story
on the new Supermen

08:17.876 --> 08:19.809
and I was hoping that

08:19.811 --> 08:22.513
you or the League might have some
inside information on these guys.

08:24.984 --> 08:28.018
just to help me
direct my efforts.

08:28.020 --> 08:31.455
So, you didn't invite me here
to grieve with you?

08:31.457 --> 08:33.224
As friends?

08:33.226 --> 08:34.695
Not really, no.

for you on the Supermen.

very thin since we lost Kal.

I don't think
the world realized

08:54.814 --> 08:56.349
how much they
depended on him.

08:57.717 --> 08:59.082
I know the feeling.

08:59.084 --> 09:01.219
(SCOFFS) No. I'm sorry, Lois.

09:01.221 --> 09:02.787
- I didn't...
- That's fine.

09:02.789 --> 09:04.288

about the new Supermen.
