18:49.086 --> 18:51.588
this top brace of the bench.

18:54.842 --> 18:58.887
Probably the suspect is bent over
either going through the pockets

18:58.971 --> 19:01.849
of the victim,
perhaps pulling his pants down.

19:01.932 --> 19:05.686
He's, uh, perhaps stabbing him

19:06.103 --> 19:08.272
We don't know, but that becomes crucial

19:08.981 --> 19:10.691
not just because it's by the victim

19:10.774 --> 19:13.569
but because it's the only print we have

19:13.652 --> 19:15.487
Palm prints, finger-- nothing else,

19:22.286 --> 19:24.663
He left a print, so he's not that sharp.

Now we might have something
to work with, something solid,

20:04.036 --> 20:05.329
MURPHY: <i>The murders stopped,</i>

<i>which forced police</i>
<i>to re-evaluate their case.</i>

20:08.081 --> 20:11.710
Detective Lange needed to build
a profile of this serial killer.

20:12.794 --> 20:16.924
<i>So he asked himself what common traits</i>
<i>do all of these crimes share?</i>

20:18.050 --> 20:21.261
We know that they had
commonality of wounds, okay.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.431
<i>Which gave us the possibility</i>
<i>it was the same weapon,</i>

20:24.514 --> 20:25.891
<i>the same knife.</i>

20:26.516 --> 20:30.062
Because dimensionally,
the blades were consistent,

20:30.145 --> 20:31.355
they were not inconsistent.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.068
<i>The victimology was the same.</i>

20:36.151 --> 20:37.819
<i>Age, gender,</i>

20:37.903 --> 20:40.072
<i>usually an inebriant,</i>

20:40.155 --> 20:41.865
<i>transient type, common.</i>

20:42.491 --> 20:45.285
<i>Time of day, at night, common.</i>

20:45.369 --> 20:47.913
<i>Location Skid Row, common.</i>

20:47.996 --> 20:51.583
We got the sexual connotations
of pants being pulled down

20:51.875 --> 20:55.003
<i>and perhaps the victim getting</i>
<i>orally copulated or whatever.</i>

20:55.087 --> 20:58.090
These are all things that are common
with all the victims.

20:58.465 --> 21:01.426
Bottom line is we still believe
these are the same person.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.558
<i>Two months go by, and there's no murders.</i>

21:08.642 --> 21:10.102
<i>This is a lull.</i>

21:10.727 --> 21:12.938
Then Jose Alvarez gets knifed to death

21:15.315 --> 21:18.944
<i>right off of Skid Row, January 24th, 1979.</i>

21:19.027 --> 21:22.322
That gave us the bookends
of the time period of the lull.

21:22.906 --> 21:25.826
The police after the--
the killing of Alvarez

21:25.909 --> 21:28.453
note that there is
some graffiti that's found

21:28.537 --> 21:30.747
<i>at the Greyhound Bus Station.</i>

21:30.831 --> 21:33.000
<i>And in the stall, it's written,</i>

21:33.083 --> 21:37.546
<i>"My name is Luther. I kill wine o's,</i>
<i>I put them out of their misery."</i>

21:38.171 --> 21:39.589
Now they have at least two cases

21:39.673 --> 21:42.009
that make reference
to a person named Luther,

21:42.092 --> 21:45.220
and they have this writing
on the bathroom stall

21:45.304 --> 21:47.556
which turned out to be
a big part of the case.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.517
<i>The second victim</i>
<i>in this series, Jose Cortez,</i>

21:50.600 --> 21:53.186
<i>was found with a cardboard box</i>

21:53.270 --> 21:55.939
<i>that had "Satan" drawn on it.</i>

21:56.023 --> 21:59.151
Luther may have something
to do with, uh, Satanism,

21:59.234 --> 22:00.402
they don't know.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.654
But at least they have
two different avenues

22:02.738 --> 22:03.739
now that they can look at.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.908
MURPHY:
<i>So in addition to trying to figure out</i>

22:06.992 --> 22:09.202
<i>whether or not there's a satanic angle,</i>

22:09.328 --> 22:12.622
the police are also trying to figure out
why did the murders stop for two months,

22:12.706 --> 22:16.001
and Tom Lange begins
to develop a theory that perhaps

22:16.084 --> 22:19.379
the killer has done a stint
in either jail or prison

22:19.463 --> 22:20.630
which would explain that.

22:20.714 --> 22:25.010
I came up with 16 different pieces
of information

22:25.635 --> 22:27.763

28:24.661 --> 28:27.664

28:33.586 --> 28:36.756
HERRERA:
<i>We were dispatched to the library.</i>

28:38.133 --> 28:40.844

28:57.569 --> 29:01.072

<i>that Kimberly Martin had been called</i>

29:14.919 --> 29:18.131

<i>with a Mike Ryan</i>
<i>at these Tamarind Apartments.</i>

29:23.511 --> 29:27.265

29:27.348 --> 29:28.767
<i>was vacant,</i>

29:28.850 --> 29:31.060
<i>yet it showed evidence</i>
<i>it had been broken into.</i>

So I go out to the crime scene

29:35.940 --> 29:39.194
<i>with Michele Kestler</i>
<i>who worked at the crime lab,</i>

29:39.277 --> 29:41.488
<i>and we brought out Prints people.</i>

29:42.989 --> 29:44.365
<i>It was unoccupied.</i>

29:46.868 --> 29:48.453
<i>Her purse was found there.</i>

29:49.579 --> 29:52.040
<i>There was obviously a sign of a scuffle.</i>

29:52.707 --> 29:55.126
Okay, now we have a crime scene,

29:55.210 --> 29:56.836

29:58.963 --> 30:02.175
HOLES: <i>One of the lucky breaks</i>
<i>about this apartment</i>

30:02.258 --> 30:04.928
<i>is that it had been recently painted</i>

30:05.011 --> 30:06.888
in order to get it ready for new tenants.

30:06.971 --> 30:10.767
<i>That means that whatever evidence</i>
<i>was inside that apartment</i>

30:10.850 --> 30:13.978
was going to be
from Kimberly and the killer.

30:14.062 --> 30:17.440
So now the lab is processing that scene.

30:17.524 --> 30:21.569
The likelihood is that it might
actually be real good evidence.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.198
<i>Fingerprint powder was applied,</i>

30:25.281 --> 30:28.535
<i>and a latent print was developed.</i>

30:32.372 --> 30:34.457
<i>It was a good, clear print.</i>

30:35.083 --> 30:37.043
<i>The suspect deposited</i>

30:38.628 --> 30:40.505
a left ring finger

30:40.588 --> 30:41.548
latent print

30:42.298 --> 30:45.885
<i>on the inside of that front door</i>
<i>surrounding the peephole.</i>

30:46.678 --> 30:49.556
<i>Perhaps indicating</i>
<i>that he was lying in wait.</i>

30:51.516 --> 30:53.893
And then I heard
from one of the technicians

30:53.977 --> 30:55.979
that they had a new technique.

30:56.062 --> 30:58.648
And I said, "What is that?"
He said, "We have a spray

30:58.731 --> 31:00.233
that we can spray on the walls."

31:00.316 --> 31:01.818
I says, "I want that done, too."

31:03.570 --> 31:05.655
HERRERA: <i>Ninhydrin was actually used,</i>

31:05.738 --> 31:09.117
and ninhydrin is a chemical
that they spray on textured walls,

31:09.200 --> 31:10.827
textured surfaces

31:10.910 --> 31:14.747
to see if any prints
could be developed chemically.

31:16.583 --> 31:21.588
<i>There was a ninhydrin print</i>
<i>that was additionally developed</i>

31:21.671 --> 31:23.631
<i>on a textured wall.</i>

31:23.756 --> 31:26.593
So, I went back

31:26.676 --> 31:29.971
and reexamined all of the latent prints

31:30.054 --> 31:33.057
that were, um, taken from the phone booth,

31:33.141 --> 31:36.686
<i>and I was able to positively identify</i>

31:36.769 --> 31:40.064
<i>one of the prints that was obtained</i>
<i>from the phone booth.</i>

31:41.441 --> 31:45.361
We had two identifications to one suspect
in the apartment,

31:45.445 --> 31:48.573

31:48.656 --> 31:50.366

31:50.450 --> 31:54.120
<i>from the print lifted</i>
<i>from the phone booth,</i>

31:54.203 --> 31:59.417

31:59.500 --> 32:01.836

that made the phone call.
