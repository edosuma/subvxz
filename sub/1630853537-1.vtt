WEBVTT

00:57.917 --> 00:59.542
Told you I'd find it.

01:00.292 --> 01:01.917
But not if they found it first.

01:03.958 --> 01:05.375
I doubt it.

01:05.542 --> 01:09.667
It looks to me like that crocodile
won't have to feed for a while.

01:34.792 --> 01:35.917
And to think you,

01:36.083 --> 01:38.292
and everyone, doubted me.

01:38.917 --> 01:42.417
You know, I don't even know why
I let you come, Brother…

01:46.833 --> 01:49.333
I'm sure you'll think of a reason.

02:07.792 --> 02:10.000
The Hamster of Darkness.

02:11.583 --> 02:12.708
Finally.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.958
And when I bring this back
to the kingdom,

02:15.125 --> 02:18.042
nobody's going to be laughing
at my ear anymore.

02:18.208 --> 02:19.208
No,

02:19.375 --> 02:21.917
I'm going to be the one
who's laughing…

02:22.083 --> 02:23.583
not at my ear of course.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.500
But because I was right,

02:25.667 --> 02:28.042
that the hamster is real.

02:34.792 --> 02:36.583
Something does not feel right.

02:36.750 --> 02:37.958
Oh hush,

02:38.125 --> 02:41.583
let me enjoy
this glorious moment.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.083
<i>Twenty years ago my father</i>
<i>and his brother Lapin</i>

03:02.250 --> 03:05.292
<i>almost found the greatest</i>
<i>artifact in the world.</i>

03:06.792 --> 03:08.208
I'm sorry, Lapin.

03:08.875 --> 03:10.292
This isn't happening.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.333
- What the…?
- Over there.

03:13.750 --> 03:16.000
<i>But they found something else…</i>

03:19.750 --> 03:20.750
<i>Me.</i>

03:26.042 --> 03:27.208
What is it?

03:29.792 --> 03:31.333
The little freak's
pointing at my ear!

03:31.833 --> 03:33.208
No, he's not.

03:33.542 --> 03:35.167
He did it again!

03:35.583 --> 03:37.833
Nonsense. He's adorable.

03:38.417 --> 03:39.792
Hi there, little guy.

03:40.042 --> 03:41.708
You're not taking him back with us?

03:41.875 --> 03:42.917
I'm not leaving him.

03:43.375 --> 03:46.375
Good thing I'm the older brother
and will be king someday,

03:46.542 --> 03:47.958
because you're too soft, Brother!

03:48.125 --> 03:50.000
Way too soft!

03:51.000 --> 03:53.042
<i>My uncle never found</i>
<i>the Hamster of Darkness.</i>

03:53.208 --> 03:54.958
<i>And he was never named king.</i>

03:55.125 --> 03:57.500
<i>But we'll get to that soon enough…</i>

04:30.042 --> 04:32.417
<i>From the moment</i>
<i>my dad brought me home,</i>

04:32.583 --> 04:34.333
<i>I was preparing for the day</i>

04:34.500 --> 04:37.458
<i>when I would become</i>
<i>a great adventurer like him.</i>

04:42.708 --> 04:44.042
There you go.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.292
Nice slap of the wrist.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.167
What do you think?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.125
<i>My favorite days were the days</i>

05:08.292 --> 05:10.833
<i>when my dad returned</i>
<i>from an adventure…</i>

05:12.250 --> 05:14.333
Personally, I don't see
what the big deal is…

05:14.500 --> 05:16.250
I mean, they just found old junk.

05:16.417 --> 05:20.125
I find old junk in alleys
and nobody's throwing me a parade.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.458
That's my turtle servant Abe.

05:22.625 --> 05:25.333
He's a "glass-is-all-empty" kind of guy.

05:26.333 --> 05:29.125
- Dad!
- Hi there, little guy.

05:29.292 --> 05:31.625
Did you find the fork
from the last brunch?

05:31.792 --> 05:33.792
And the knife!

05:34.125 --> 05:37.667
But I couldn't find the spoon!

05:37.833 --> 05:39.750
Of course, I found the spoon!

05:45.833 --> 05:49.708
<i>When I saw how everyone looked up</i>
<i>to adventurers like my dad,</i>

05:50.250 --> 05:55.125
<i>there and then I decided</i>
<i>that's how I wanted them to see me.</i>

05:59.333 --> 06:03.667
And so there I was, 200 feet
above hare-eating crocodiles,

06:03.833 --> 06:06.125
hanging from a cliff.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.667
- And then what happened?
- And then…

06:12.750 --> 06:14.167
you went to bed.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.667
That's why they call it
a cliffhanger, pal.

06:18.833 --> 06:22.458
Good night,
my future royal adventurer.

06:40.125 --> 06:42.042
<i>I was obsessed with adventuring.</i>

06:42.208 --> 06:44.625
<i>I stayed up every night reading.</i>

06:52.250 --> 06:54.083
Stupid feathers…

06:59.625 --> 07:04.042
<i>I devoured every book about adventuring</i>
<i>and spent hours in the royal library…</i>

07:04.583 --> 07:07.833
<i>I could not get enough of it.</i>
<i>I knew the day would come.</i>

07:20.875 --> 07:24.250
I don't think heavy lifting
is in my job description.

07:42.167 --> 07:44.792
The tryouts, let's go, Abe.

08:08.208 --> 08:11.917
<i>Every year I watched</i>
<i>the Royal Adventure Society tryouts,</i>

08:12.500 --> 08:15.125
<i>determined to pick up tips</i>
<i>for when it was my turn to run.</i>

08:18.417 --> 08:20.333
Why'd you invite him to sit with us?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.875
My dad made me
'cause his dad's the new king.

08:24.042 --> 08:26.667
I can't believe we gotta be seen
with that freak Chickenhare.

08:26.833 --> 08:27.833
It could be worse.

08:28.292 --> 08:30.375
We could be Chickenhare.

08:31.458 --> 08:33.125
- Right?
- Oh man.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.167
That was a lot of fun.

09:18.708 --> 09:19.750
What a crock,

09:19.917 --> 09:23.208
the competitors are getting
better and better every year.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.500
- Some world classic…
- Chickenhare?

09:27.500 --> 09:28.667
What are you wearing?

09:29.667 --> 09:31.917
Like it? It's very in.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.500
It's very now… now.

09:34.667 --> 09:39.125
Boots that make you look like
you have hare feet are very now… now?

09:39.292 --> 09:42.167
Style's changed a lot since
you were a kid, Dad.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.917
Come on,
let's take that hat off so I can…

09:45.083 --> 09:46.125
No!

09:46.292 --> 09:48.625
Everybody laughs at me, Dad.

09:48.792 --> 09:51.917
I know it's hard being different.

09:52.292 --> 09:55.958
No, you don't know.
Nobody knows what it's like to be me.

09:56.917 --> 09:59.875
Chickenhare,
now what have I always told you?

10:00.042 --> 10:02.542
The things that make us different…

10:02.708 --> 10:04.958
Are the things that make us special.

10:05.375 --> 10:08.083
Yeah, I know, Dad.
But I don't wanna be special.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.083
I just wanna be normal.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.292
And wearing this,

10:13.167 --> 10:15.042
I feel normal.

10:16.958 --> 10:20.667
Maybe I'm not as up
on the fashion trends as I used to be.

10:21.417 --> 10:23.083
It's not just you, Dad!

10:23.250 --> 10:24.833
It's all old people.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.833
And check out what I can do
in my new boots.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.417
I'm okay.

10:34.583 --> 10:35.583
All good…

10:35.958 --> 10:37.167
Little sore, but good.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.750
It's just a phase.
He'll grow out of it.

11:14.417 --> 11:17.250
This is it, Abe. Moment of truth.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.667
The day all my dreams come true.

11:19.833 --> 11:22.542
Remember my three keys to success?

11:22.708 --> 11:25.708
Don't. Screw. Up.

11:26.583 --> 11:28.958
In accordance with the laws
in the Royal Rulebook,

11:29.125 --> 11:32.208
those applicants today
who reach the finish line

11:32.375 --> 11:37.333
shall be considered for
the Royal Adventure Society for life.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.083
First up, Chickenhare.

11:52.583 --> 11:54.708
This should be interesting!

12:09.708 --> 12:11.083
Come on!

12:18.875 --> 12:20.333
That's just slowing me down.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.500
What are you doing?

12:39.333 --> 12:40.417
Ouch, that hurts.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.208
Just getting my bearings.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.875
Time to make up some ground.

13:06.708 --> 13:07.708
Here we go.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.542
I'm okay, I'm okay.
Just go on.

13:28.417 --> 13:29.417
Sorry!

13:46.375 --> 13:47.583
Hey, that's cheating!

14:07.958 --> 14:08.958
Come on.

14:09.125 --> 14:10.250
You're almost there.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.792
All you have to do is get across
the Really-Really-Deep-

14:13.958 --> 14:16.958
But-Not-Quite-Bottomless-Pit.

14:20.708 --> 14:22.125
Careful, Son.

14:22.917 --> 14:25.875
I can't watch,
but I can't look away.

14:32.208 --> 14:33.208
Easy.

14:39.292 --> 14:40.375
- Come here.
- Let it go!

15:07.708 --> 15:11.042
- Well, there's always a plan B.
- I don't have a plan B.

15:11.208 --> 15:13.333
You could become a stamp collector.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.333
Yeah, it's like an adventure
every time the mail comes.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.000
And the mail comes every day.
That's a lot of adventures.

15:20.625 --> 15:24.667
What's so great about being
a royal adventurer anyway?

15:24.833 --> 15:26.458
Besides the fame and adulation?

15:26.625 --> 15:29.375
Hey, Chickenhare, nice work today!

15:29.542 --> 15:31.250
Nothing but net!

15:32.542 --> 15:35.625
What'd you expect?
He's mostly chicken.

15:36.042 --> 15:37.458
No, he's mostly hare.

15:37.625 --> 15:38.708
- Chicken!
- Hare!

15:38.875 --> 15:40.417
- Chicken!
- Hare!

15:40.583 --> 15:44.125
You know, if you close your eyes
and take it out of context,

15:44.292 --> 15:46.333
it sounds like
they're cheering for you.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.708
Chicken! Hare! Chicken! Hare!

15:49.792 --> 15:50.875
Chicken…

15:56.958 --> 15:59.583
Why can't I be like everyone else?

15:59.917 --> 16:01.208
Chickenhare?

16:01.375 --> 16:03.333
Geez, Dad, think you could knock?

16:04.333 --> 16:05.333
Sorry.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.208
Thought you'd want to talk
about what happened today.

16:08.375 --> 16:09.750
Oh, that.

16:10.417 --> 16:12.208
Just a minor setback is all.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.167
Next year, I'm gonna focus
on doing more cardio.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.625
Maybe some altitude training.

16:17.792 --> 16:20.333
You do know you can't audition twice.

16:20.500 --> 16:24.083
Well I figured since you're the King,
you could make an exception.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.167
I can't break the rules
just because you're my son.

16:27.583 --> 16:28.792
Come on, Dad.

16:28.958 --> 16:31.792
All I need is one more shot.
I know I could crush it…

16:31.958 --> 16:34.667
Chickenhare, you need
to put your energies elsewhere.

16:38.917 --> 16:42.875
I know it's difficult
to let go of your dream.

16:43.042 --> 16:45.833
I just don't want
to see you get hurt again.

16:47.292 --> 16:49.500
Is this because I embarrassed you?

16:50.042 --> 16:53.458
Chickenhare.
You could never embarrass me.

16:53.625 --> 16:57.708
When I look at you,
I wish you could see what I see.

16:57.875 --> 16:59.708
Yeah, wish I could too.

16:59.875 --> 17:03.500
All I see is that I got the worst parts
of a hare and a chicken.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.958
Maybe you got the best parts.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.625
Do you know

17:07.792 --> 17:10.583
the greatest treasure I ever found?

17:10.958 --> 17:12.917
The Fountain of Middle Age?

17:13.083 --> 17:14.500
It was you.

17:14.667 --> 17:19.417
Finding you when Uncle Lapin and I went
searching for the Hamster of Darkness

17:19.583 --> 17:22.250
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

17:23.458 --> 17:24.792
Goodnight, Son.

17:40.208 --> 17:41.750
Oh, shut up!

17:43.917 --> 17:45.292
I've studied adventuring

17:45.458 --> 17:47.000
more than anybody, right?

17:47.792 --> 17:51.875
I've gotta figure out the location
of the treasure that every adventurer

17:52.042 --> 17:54.625
has been searching for,
but has never found…

17:59.333 --> 18:01.000
And when I figure that out,

18:01.167 --> 18:04.042
he'll have to let me
into the Royal Adventurer Society.

18:06.875 --> 18:07.875
What's the treasure?

18:08.458 --> 18:11.125
Come on,
you know what I'm talking about.

18:11.292 --> 18:14.167
The greatest
undiscovered treasure of all time…

18:14.333 --> 18:17.875
Gotcha. The greatest
undiscovered treasure of all time.

18:18.333 --> 18:19.333
I have no idea.

18:19.917 --> 18:23.500
Arturo the Rodent King created it
to take over the world.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.167
Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.708
Then his brother Ramon
stole it and hid it

18:27.875 --> 18:29.875
before Arturo could use it.

18:30.833 --> 18:33.833
It's got the power
of a million hamsters!

18:36.125 --> 18:37.875
Nope, still don't have it.

18:38.292 --> 18:40.833
It rhymes
with the "Damster of Harkness".

18:46.792 --> 18:50.250
The Hamster of Darkness, Abe!
How could you not get that?

18:50.583 --> 18:53.375
From where I'm sitting,
it was a problem with the clues.

18:53.542 --> 18:55.375
According to the old legends,

18:55.542 --> 18:57.667
"At the hour of 9
on a new day's dawn,

18:58.667 --> 19:01.125
"the constellation
of the hamster shall point

19:01.292 --> 19:03.500
"to The Temple
of the Hamster of Darkness."

19:03.667 --> 19:05.083
Well, it's almost 9

19:05.250 --> 19:07.833
which means I'm about
to make time-and-a-half.

19:08.958 --> 19:10.250
There's just one problem.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.875
You can't see a constellation
at 9 in the morning.

19:13.042 --> 19:14.125
It's too bright out.

19:14.292 --> 19:17.000
- We gotta be missing something.
- Yeah, breakfast.

19:17.292 --> 19:19.208
- I'm starving!
- I need the original text.

19:32.042 --> 19:34.167
<i>Erik the Literal's Volume 13</i>

19:34.333 --> 19:36.833
on the Hamster of Darkness
is checked out.

19:37.250 --> 19:38.333
When's it due back?

19:38.958 --> 19:40.458
Three months ago.

19:41.250 --> 19:44.250
Fine, I'll go get it myself.
So, who's got it?

19:44.917 --> 19:46.750
Your Uncle Lapin.

19:51.333 --> 19:55.083
So how long has it been
since you've seen your uncle?

19:55.250 --> 19:57.917
Not since he tried
to overthrow my father.

19:58.083 --> 20:01.875
He wasn't happy that my grandfather
chose my dad as king and not him.

20:02.042 --> 20:03.958
Talk about rich people's problems.

20:04.125 --> 20:05.375
Let's go.

20:05.542 --> 20:06.917
I'm sure time has mellowed him.

20:07.083 --> 20:09.125
Oh no.
My duties as your turtleservant

20:09.292 --> 20:11.208
do not extend to accompanying you

20:11.375 --> 20:14.417
to meet with your terrifying uncle
in his jail cell.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.833
Nothing about meeting
with evil uncles in their jail cells…

20:19.542 --> 20:21.500
See, this is why you join a union.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.375
Servants-and-Bed-Pan-Handlers Local 645.

20:24.542 --> 20:26.542
Strength through numbers.

20:48.750 --> 20:49.750
What's he in for?

20:50.083 --> 20:51.083
Murder.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.417
Tax evasion.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.167
I murdered the tax code.

20:56.125 --> 21:00.333
The prison that can hold Barry Goldfarb
hasn't been built!

21:01.750 --> 21:03.042
Some rules to remember:

21:03.208 --> 21:06.500
Do not pass Lapin anything
as he will turn it into a weapon,

21:06.667 --> 21:07.875
even a carrot.

21:08.042 --> 21:10.417
Do not approach his cell.
Do not touch the bars.

21:10.583 --> 21:12.667
And whatever you do,
don't reach through the bars.

21:12.833 --> 21:15.667
The last guy to do that
spent a month in the hospital.

21:15.833 --> 21:19.875
Granted that was for the flu.
But I'm sure he caught it from Lapin.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.750
You're not coming with me?

21:22.917 --> 21:26.083
The union says I don't have to.
Thank goodness

21:26.250 --> 21:29.167
for Prison-Guards-and-Haberdashers
Local 646.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.125
Strength through numbers.

21:59.833 --> 22:00.833
Nephew?

22:01.875 --> 22:03.750
What a pleasant surprise.

22:04.292 --> 22:05.625
Hi, Uncle Lapin.

22:05.792 --> 22:09.333
I was in the neighborhood
and thought it might be nice

22:09.958 --> 22:12.833
to stop by and say "hi".

22:13.167 --> 22:14.167
So…

22:14.625 --> 22:15.625
Hi!

22:16.542 --> 22:17.625
And oh yeah,

22:17.792 --> 22:20.417
there's this book
that you've got from the library.

22:20.583 --> 22:22.542
It's actually long overdue.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.583
Oh no.
What are they gonna do,

22:25.750 --> 22:26.833
lock me up?

22:29.417 --> 22:30.500
Right.

22:30.833 --> 22:33.375
That's funny because
you're already locked up

22:33.542 --> 22:35.458
for trying to overthrow my father.

22:35.625 --> 22:38.750
Well, I always did have a problem
with authority.

22:38.917 --> 22:42.250
So, you're looking
for the Hamster of Darkness,

22:42.583 --> 22:43.583
are you?

22:45.042 --> 22:46.458
I don't think it's real.

22:46.625 --> 22:47.625
Really?

22:48.625 --> 22:51.542
Every time I've requested a book
on the topic of adventuring

22:51.708 --> 22:55.292
and it wasn't in,
it was because you had checked it out.

22:55.958 --> 22:58.500
Somebody's been doing
their homework.

22:58.667 --> 23:01.583
It's real. And we both know it.

23:02.042 --> 23:04.542
It'd be quite a feather
in your cap to bring back

23:04.708 --> 23:08.333
to the Royal Adventure Society,
wouldn't it?

23:09.042 --> 23:10.208
Maybe…

23:11.542 --> 23:12.917
Such a waste.

23:13.083 --> 23:15.625
You see, when I find
the Hamster of Darkness,

23:15.792 --> 23:18.583
I'm going to use it
to take over the kingdom.

23:21.208 --> 23:22.292
I'm just joking.

23:22.458 --> 23:25.083
Besides, I'm locked in this tower

23:25.250 --> 23:28.125
that no one has ever escaped from.

23:28.292 --> 23:29.625
You think I've been waiting here,

23:29.792 --> 23:33.208
hoping you'd visit because you were
the final piece of my escape plan?

23:34.500 --> 23:36.833
I wish I was that cunning.
But now…

23:37.500 --> 23:39.833
let me find that book for you.

23:40.875 --> 23:43.167
Is this the one?

23:43.542 --> 23:45.625
Oh yeah, that's the one.

23:46.417 --> 23:48.792
So, if you'd just toss it on over here,

23:48.958 --> 23:52.750
I'll get out of your way
and you can go back

23:53.208 --> 23:55.750
to marking the days
on the wall with chalk.

23:56.125 --> 24:00.708
I'm afraid my time in here
has weakened me.

24:01.375 --> 24:03.042
Come over here.

24:03.625 --> 24:06.833
Why not just give it a little toss?

24:09.792 --> 24:11.208
On second thought,

24:11.542 --> 24:12.708
I'll come get it.

24:24.583 --> 24:26.917
Hold on.
I just remembered…

24:27.292 --> 24:28.500
I'm not done with it.

24:31.833 --> 24:34.042
Goodbye, Chickenhare.

24:34.208 --> 24:36.125
Don't forget your hat.

25:04.667 --> 25:05.875
Oh no…

25:11.917 --> 25:16.292
"Dear Brother,
enjoy your last days as king.

25:16.458 --> 25:18.292
"All the best, Lapin."

25:18.458 --> 25:20.125
I'm sorry, Dad.

25:20.292 --> 25:23.042
You know you're not allowed
to visit Lapin!

25:23.333 --> 25:24.500
What were you thinking?

25:24.667 --> 25:27.625
He had this book I needed
about the Hamster of Darkness.

25:27.792 --> 25:30.708
- See I figured…
- I told you to let it go.

25:31.792 --> 25:33.125
Sir, it's a map!

25:34.667 --> 25:37.083
"The Tomb of the Unknown Turtle"?

25:37.250 --> 25:40.750
The ancient adventurer Frederic
the Extremely Short proposed that

25:41.083 --> 25:43.583
as one of the rumored locations
of the Hamster of Darkness.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.417
That's where Lapin's going.

25:45.583 --> 25:47.500
Ready my fastest boat.
We leave immediately.

25:49.458 --> 25:52.500
Dad, I know everything
about the Hamster of Darkness.

25:52.667 --> 25:53.792
Bring me along, I can help.

25:54.167 --> 25:56.833
No. You've done enough already.

26:21.167 --> 26:24.042
Hey, Boss, just came by
to see how you're doing.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.208
Other than letting the Kingdom's
most dangerous criminal escape.

26:27.375 --> 26:28.917
- I'm doing great.
- You are?

26:29.083 --> 26:32.208
- Look what was behind the bookshelf.
- An abstract painting?

26:32.833 --> 26:33.833
A map, Abe.

26:35.125 --> 26:37.667
Lapin's been obsessed
with the Hamster of Darkness.

26:37.833 --> 26:39.375
It doesn't make sense
that he'd think

26:39.542 --> 26:42.250
the Temple would be
at the Tomb of the Unknown Turtle.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.625
That's been searched so many times.

26:45.375 --> 26:47.208
It's a minute before 9,

26:47.750 --> 26:49.042
something's missing.

26:49.542 --> 26:52.542
The moths are gonna be
the only ones to miss Lapin.

26:52.708 --> 26:54.083
It's winter.

26:54.250 --> 26:55.833
There are no moths.

26:57.458 --> 26:58.917
It's the constellation!

26:59.708 --> 27:00.708
Coincidence.

27:00.875 --> 27:01.958
It's not, Abe.

27:02.125 --> 27:04.417
Lapin has been on his quest for years.

27:04.583 --> 27:07.375
It's not a blanket,
it's a curtain, give me that.

27:12.167 --> 27:14.250
You see, total coincidence.

27:14.542 --> 27:16.292
I'm not so sure.

27:16.708 --> 27:17.958
Let me clear the floor.

27:18.125 --> 27:19.333
Yes, that's it!

27:19.500 --> 27:20.583
The book.

27:25.958 --> 27:29.000
"At the hour of 9
on a new day's dawn,

27:29.375 --> 27:31.083
"the constellation shall point

27:31.583 --> 27:34.250
"to The Temple
of the Hamster of Darkness."

27:56.042 --> 27:57.375
Bingo.

27:57.917 --> 28:01.042
Where's the "X"? Don't maps need
an "X" to mark the spot?

28:03.125 --> 28:05.250
Oh, darn tropes.

28:09.292 --> 28:10.958
Dad! Wait!

28:11.125 --> 28:13.000
You're going the wrong way!

28:16.417 --> 28:18.208
We need to get a boat ready.

28:18.375 --> 28:21.292
We have to beat Lapin
to the Hamster of Darkness.

28:21.458 --> 28:24.667
Oh no, forget about it.
I am not an adventurer.

28:24.833 --> 28:27.625
And you're…
How do I put this delicately?

28:27.792 --> 28:29.458
You're… you.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.417
Maybe I'm not much of an adventurer,

28:31.583 --> 28:33.958
but we're the only ones
who can do this now.

28:34.250 --> 28:35.750
And if we don't,

28:35.917 --> 28:38.625
Lapin's gonna come back
and take over the Kingdom.

28:38.917 --> 28:41.167
Well, unemployment is kinda high.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.667
And your dad's been king for what?
15 years?

28:43.833 --> 28:46.250
This is serious, Abe.
And it's all my fault.

28:46.833 --> 28:49.167
Not all. Only like 90%.

28:49.417 --> 28:51.708
I'm going.
And I want you to come with me.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.708
I'm your royal servant.
I'm legally bound to go with you.

28:55.167 --> 28:58.833
No. I'm not asking as your master.

28:59.292 --> 29:01.042
I'm asking you as a friend.

29:01.208 --> 29:02.875
That makes it an easy decision.

29:05.458 --> 29:08.792
Actually, that makes it
an incredibly difficult decision.

29:08.958 --> 29:10.500
Can you be friends with your boss?

29:11.208 --> 29:14.500
Isn't the relationship completely skewed
by the power dynamic?

29:14.667 --> 29:15.667
What?

29:15.833 --> 29:17.458
These are deep questions.

29:17.625 --> 29:20.417
I, for one, find them
intellectually invigorating.

29:20.583 --> 29:22.333
Wait, wait.

29:22.708 --> 29:24.083
Actually, I'm sorry,
keep going.

29:24.958 --> 29:25.958
Wait.

29:27.625 --> 29:28.667
I'm coming…

29:28.833 --> 29:30.042
friend.

29:30.208 --> 29:32.833
But be prepared
for a lot of "I told you so's."

29:39.458 --> 29:44.000
<i>I have been at sea</i>
<i>for 12 long minutes.</i>

29:44.167 --> 29:46.000
<i>The heat is unbearable.</i>

29:46.333 --> 29:48.667
<i>Thirst is a constant companion.</i>

29:48.833 --> 29:50.458
<i>And as for hunger,</i>

29:50.625 --> 29:54.667
<i>I may be developing</i>
<i>a taste for chicken and hare.</i>

29:59.208 --> 30:00.917
Not too late to turn around.

30:01.375 --> 30:03.125
I always wanted an adventure.

30:03.292 --> 30:05.750
I just hope we can pull it off.

30:05.917 --> 30:07.167
I'm sure we will.

30:10.250 --> 30:13.250
<i>I have no confidence</i>
<i>in our chances.</i>

30:13.417 --> 30:16.542
<i>If you're reading this,</i>
<i>that means I've either been crushed,</i>

30:16.708 --> 30:19.417
<i>impaled, pole-axed, harpooned,</i>

30:19.583 --> 30:22.125
<i>eaten alive by carnivorous beetles,</i>

30:22.292 --> 30:24.667
<i>drowned in a sea full of sharks,</i>

30:24.833 --> 30:28.500
<i>killed by birds</i>
<i>pecking at my every being.</i>

30:42.417 --> 30:44.083
So, so parched.

30:48.375 --> 30:49.583
Water?

30:51.583 --> 30:53.542
Oh, that goes down nice.
Oh yeah.

30:53.708 --> 30:54.917
So, parched.

30:55.667 --> 30:57.542
That jet stream gets me every time.

30:57.708 --> 30:58.792
Well?

30:58.958 --> 31:00.667
Huh? Oh, yeah uh…

31:00.833 --> 31:03.792
The King took the bait.
Everything's going like we planned.

31:03.958 --> 31:05.167
Like <i>we</i> planned?

31:05.625 --> 31:06.750
Well, yeah, okay.

31:06.917 --> 31:10.417
Technically it was your plan,
but I agreed it was a great plan.

31:11.167 --> 31:13.208
No, it's the perfect plan.

31:13.708 --> 31:16.500
- Well, not quite perfect.
- What?

31:17.250 --> 31:18.250
It's your nephew.

31:18.417 --> 31:19.417
The freak?

31:19.750 --> 31:21.792
He knows where the hamster is.

31:21.958 --> 31:25.375
And he and his little turtle friend
are following us.

31:25.542 --> 31:27.750
Hey, I figured we could wait for them,

31:27.917 --> 31:31.750
then flank them
and engage them in a nautical battle.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.042
I've always wanted
to be in a nautical battle.

31:35.375 --> 31:39.292
Please remember you're here
because of your wings, not your brain.

31:39.750 --> 31:42.083
I cannot waste valuable time
on the off chance

31:42.250 --> 31:45.208
that the freak actually makes it
across the ocean.

31:46.167 --> 31:47.292
No,

31:47.583 --> 31:50.083
we'll subcontract this one out.

31:50.583 --> 31:54.833
And I have just the animal
for the job.

31:57.542 --> 31:58.667
<i>Luther,</i>

31:58.833 --> 32:01.167
<i>the last member of our team.</i>

32:01.542 --> 32:03.500
<i>The most ruthless animal</i>

32:03.667 --> 32:05.917
<i>I've ever had the pleasure</i>
<i>of working with.</i>

32:06.083 --> 32:07.083
<i>He's so mean,</i>

32:07.833 --> 32:09.833
<i>he once killed an animal</i>

32:10.083 --> 32:11.750
<i>just for snoring.</i>

32:13.833 --> 32:16.625
I have sleep apnea.

32:17.625 --> 32:18.708
It's pretty bad.

32:18.875 --> 32:20.458
Can we get separate rooms?

32:21.417 --> 32:24.417
Lapin, it's been too long.

32:27.167 --> 32:28.958
It's okay, little guy…

32:49.958 --> 32:54.000
This city is where Alexander the Sweaty
discovered the Mustache of Destiny.

32:55.250 --> 32:57.333
Isn't this place great?

32:57.500 --> 33:01.125
Yeah. Great place to get murdered.
Why are we here anyway?

33:01.292 --> 33:02.458
Follow me.

33:04.458 --> 33:05.958
This very tavern

33:06.125 --> 33:09.417
is where Hector the Lost
hired the legless sherpa

33:09.583 --> 33:11.583
who led him to the Atheist's Temple.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.458
I never thought I'd see it
with my own eyes.

33:14.625 --> 33:17.333
I think you and I have
very different bucket lists.

33:20.792 --> 33:23.333
With any luck,
this is where we'll find our guide.

33:23.708 --> 33:25.708
Or at least a communicable disease.

33:25.875 --> 33:27.625
Hey. You need a guide?

33:28.083 --> 33:29.417
I'm your gal.

33:29.583 --> 33:32.458
I know that jungle
like the back of my tail. And the front.

33:32.625 --> 33:35.125
Don't do it, kid. She's bad news.

33:35.292 --> 33:37.792
Only a fool without a snout
would hire a skunk.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.958
The guy you want's over there.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.000
Excuse me?

33:48.417 --> 33:49.792
I'm looking for a guide.

33:50.333 --> 33:53.125
Well, fellow hare,

33:53.292 --> 33:54.917
you've come to the right rat.

33:55.083 --> 33:58.792
The name's Rusty,
but my sense of direction's not.

33:59.167 --> 34:02.792
Come on, let's go talk in the back,
away from prying ears.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.333
Yup.
I think we can totally trust this guy.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.292
Not suspicious at all.

34:12.875 --> 34:16.375
- So Rusty, we gotta go to…
- I already know where you're going.

34:16.875 --> 34:18.042
You do?

34:18.208 --> 34:20.750
Wow.
No wonder you're a guide.

34:21.292 --> 34:22.792
You're going with him.

34:28.417 --> 34:29.833
He's joking, right?

34:33.333 --> 34:36.583
Please tell me we've stumbled
into a very messed-up daycare.

34:37.333 --> 34:38.625
Rusty?

34:38.792 --> 34:39.958
Is this guide humor?

34:40.125 --> 34:44.208
You didn't tell me this guy was looking
for the Hamster of Darkness.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.750
You lose your manners
along with that eye?

34:48.458 --> 34:50.250
Stay out of this skunk!

34:50.625 --> 34:52.750
Yeah, it's me,
I'm Meg by the way.

34:52.917 --> 34:56.083
I don't care.
Now give me that map.

34:56.375 --> 34:59.042
Over our dead bodies.

34:59.208 --> 35:01.250
So, Mr. Gorilla, just to be clear,

35:01.417 --> 35:04.458
Meg was speaking metaphorically
about the dead bodies thing.

35:05.500 --> 35:06.708
He's a literalist.

35:16.417 --> 35:17.500
Take this!

35:17.667 --> 35:20.000
Yeah, my kind of girl!

35:24.833 --> 35:26.708
We're in a bar fight, Abe!

35:37.250 --> 35:38.792
Our map! He's getting away.

35:38.958 --> 35:40.292
Or not.

35:42.625 --> 35:45.625
Yeah, come on,
is that all you got?

35:58.292 --> 35:59.958
Meg, you're amazing.

36:00.458 --> 36:03.208
I'm assuming you're not going
with Rusty as your guide.

36:03.375 --> 36:05.542
You know,
because of the whole betrayal thing.

36:05.708 --> 36:07.083
You're hired!

36:07.500 --> 36:11.125
This should probably be a lesson,
don't judge a book by its cover,

36:11.292 --> 36:13.917
'cause you might end up
reading a really bad book.

36:21.625 --> 36:25.208
I'm really, really sorry.

36:25.375 --> 36:27.167
Meg? We've got a problem…

36:27.333 --> 36:29.042
And I've got the solution.

36:29.208 --> 36:30.792
Guys, put these on.

36:32.542 --> 36:33.667
Now.

36:41.958 --> 36:43.167
What a blast!

36:43.333 --> 36:45.792
I'm gonna keep this if that's okay.

36:48.917 --> 36:52.667
Oh darn,
I need to change your diaper.

36:57.250 --> 37:01.333
Hold up. This sweat is chaffing me
like there's no tomorrow…

37:01.500 --> 37:03.292
Which there probably isn't.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.125
That's better.

37:11.375 --> 37:14.042
A little hot in that jacket?

37:14.208 --> 37:17.583
Not at all.
I'm actually a little cold.

37:17.750 --> 37:20.917
Okay… So, I know
we haven't talked compensation,

37:21.083 --> 37:22.875
but I have a proposal.

37:23.042 --> 37:26.167
I'll take you to wherever
you wanna go for free.

37:26.583 --> 37:27.708
What's the catch?

37:27.875 --> 37:30.167
I've been on a fair number
of adventures myself,

37:30.333 --> 37:33.750
exclusively solo expeditions,
you know, 'cause of the skunk thing.

37:34.417 --> 37:37.708
And the truth is,
it's been kind of lonely.

37:43.542 --> 37:47.500
Meg, you can stay
with us as long as you like.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.042
- Really?
- Really?

37:49.208 --> 37:51.750
You are not going to regret this.
No sirree.

37:51.917 --> 37:55.125
I gotta say, I think we're on the cusp
of something great here.

37:55.292 --> 37:58.167
Something epic,
something unprecedented.

38:00.792 --> 38:03.875
Hamster of Darkness.
That's the Big One.

38:04.042 --> 38:06.667
When we find it,
they'll put us on the cover

38:06.833 --> 38:09.667
of <i>Adventure Weekly</i>
and <i>Adventure Monthly</i>.

38:11.542 --> 38:13.958
And Chickenhare,
if they put your name first,

38:14.125 --> 38:17.667
I'm totally fine with that,
just happy to be part of the team.

38:17.833 --> 38:20.458
You think she brought anything
to plug my ears?

38:22.292 --> 38:24.583
Hey, what kind of name
is Chickenhare anyway?

38:24.750 --> 38:26.542
Is that part Yukinarian?

38:27.250 --> 38:29.083
I actually don't know.

38:29.250 --> 38:33.000
Really? No clue?
Because it is such a unique name.

38:33.167 --> 38:35.250
Well, it's very unusual.

38:35.417 --> 38:38.167
Because I see the hare,
but I don't see the chicken.

38:38.333 --> 38:41.042
I'm gonna figure this out,
I'm great at puzzles.

38:48.333 --> 38:52.167
Well, that's too bad.
Looks like we'll have to head back.

38:53.375 --> 38:54.500
Follow me.

38:57.167 --> 38:58.333
Your turn.

38:59.958 --> 39:01.083
Why can't I meet anyone

39:01.250 --> 39:03.542
who shares my pessimism?

39:06.167 --> 39:10.167
If you take off that jacket,
it might help with your follow-through.

39:10.333 --> 39:13.250
Just a suggestion.
What do I know, I'm just a skunk, right?

39:13.625 --> 39:16.958
No, no. I'm good!
Third time's a charm!

39:20.875 --> 39:21.875
Now what?

39:24.125 --> 39:26.083
Stay put and don't try
anything foolish.

39:33.667 --> 39:36.708
I expected more from you, Luther.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.833
I won't tolerate another mistake.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.375
And why is this thing even here,

39:43.542 --> 39:47.042
why isn't he at home with your wife?
What has happened to you?

39:47.208 --> 39:49.875
See, Lapin,
me and my wife have 2-3 jobs.

39:50.042 --> 39:52.417
It's hard, you know,
providing for the baby.

39:52.583 --> 39:55.708
See, I can't afford
the cost of diapers and…

39:55.875 --> 39:56.875
Enough!

39:57.042 --> 40:01.542
Has the entire criminal underworld
gone soft since I've been locked up?

40:03.000 --> 40:06.708
Do me a favor,
go back to your wife.

40:07.375 --> 40:08.708
Go!

40:12.000 --> 40:13.833
Oh good, the duck's back.

40:14.375 --> 40:16.500
Please tell me
something positive.

40:16.750 --> 40:19.125
Chickenhare made it through
the Desert of Death.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.125
What? Impossible!

40:21.458 --> 40:24.750
Well, technically improbable
since he did make it through.

40:24.917 --> 40:26.583
He's just a couple clicks behind us.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.250
What are clicks?

40:28.417 --> 40:32.375
I hear that term on missions like this,
but I don't know what they are.

40:32.542 --> 40:34.458
Destroy the bridge.

40:34.625 --> 40:37.292
It will take them a week
to get around the quicksand.

40:38.500 --> 40:42.958
By then, I'll have Featherbeard
completely under my control.

40:43.917 --> 40:46.250
Our control.

40:47.583 --> 40:49.917
Your control… obviously.

41:02.917 --> 41:06.292
We'll have to go around,
that's gonna take at least a week.

41:06.458 --> 41:07.917
We don't have a week.

41:08.083 --> 41:11.000
My Uncle Lapin'll already have
the hamster by then.

41:11.167 --> 41:12.208
We can cross it.

41:12.750 --> 41:15.833
Sure, for a couple of feet.
But then we'd die!

41:16.417 --> 41:19.958
Because this is quicksand!
Quicksand sucks you under until you die!

41:20.125 --> 41:22.583
That's what it does!
That's its reason for existing!

41:22.750 --> 41:27.000
Chickenhare is right, we should try.
The quicksand is only in a few spots.

41:27.167 --> 41:29.583
If we avoid those spots,
we'll have a solid path.

41:30.250 --> 41:32.000
Do you know where that path is?

41:32.167 --> 41:34.333
Just follow in my footsteps
and you'll be okay.

41:35.750 --> 41:37.125
I'll go last.

41:40.958 --> 41:42.708
Who's this Uncle Lapin?

41:43.375 --> 41:45.208
He's just a genius adventurer

41:45.375 --> 41:50.625
with grandiose plans most likely
covering a deep-seeded insecurity.

41:50.792 --> 41:53.583
Sounds like someone else I know.

41:54.458 --> 41:56.208
- Chickenhare!
- Oh no!

41:56.375 --> 41:58.250
- Chickenhare!
- Abe, help!

41:58.625 --> 42:01.792
Grab onto me.
Darn, I'm a goner too.

42:01.958 --> 42:03.208
Hey, watch the shell!

42:03.375 --> 42:05.000
Hold on, Chickenhare.

42:09.208 --> 42:10.208
Meg!

42:10.375 --> 42:11.792
I'm going down!

42:11.958 --> 42:13.708
Stay still, don't move.

42:23.292 --> 42:24.500
What are you doing?

42:24.667 --> 42:26.125
Grab the whip!

42:26.542 --> 42:28.917
With your hands!
Isn't that kind of implied?

42:30.542 --> 42:31.542
Just pull!

42:33.167 --> 42:35.292
A little help, Abe!
Hurry!

42:38.125 --> 42:39.250
You need to use your hands!

42:39.792 --> 42:42.958
Isn't it a pretty simple concept
he's failing to grasp? Abe!

42:53.625 --> 42:56.333
Oh, my gosh!
I'm pulling him out of his skin!

43:05.417 --> 43:08.125
Wait, are those… chicken legs?

43:10.333 --> 43:13.667
Hold on a second.
Chickenhare… Oh, lightning bolt!

43:13.833 --> 43:16.000
That's where the name
comes from!

43:16.167 --> 43:19.208
Told you I was great at puzzles!
Those are chicken feet.

43:20.042 --> 43:22.833
You're part chicken, part hare,
aren't you?

43:24.958 --> 43:27.292
Hello, what about me?

43:27.458 --> 43:30.667
Hey, a little help here, guys,
I'm stuck.

43:37.417 --> 43:39.500
- Do you have other chicken parts?
- No.

43:43.625 --> 43:44.625
Hey!

43:45.000 --> 43:46.417
That is… awesome!

43:47.292 --> 43:49.750
What else?
Do you have wings?

43:50.417 --> 43:52.125
You have wings under that jacket!

43:52.292 --> 43:56.167
Nope. You've seen the top-shelf stuff.
He has a couple feathers under there.

43:56.333 --> 43:58.375
- Lemme see 'em.
- No!

43:58.792 --> 44:01.542
- Are there other chickenhares?
- Not that I know of.

44:01.708 --> 44:04.917
You're your own species!
How awesome is that?

44:05.083 --> 44:07.042
You're basically
automatically endangered.

44:07.208 --> 44:10.042
- It's not awesome!
- So like what you can do?

44:10.208 --> 44:11.958
Oh my gosh, you can fly!

44:12.125 --> 44:15.000
I can't fly.
Chickens can't even fly.

44:15.167 --> 44:17.667
Technically they can over
very short distances.

44:17.833 --> 44:20.208
Oh come on,
but you're only part chicken.

44:20.375 --> 44:22.500
How many flying hares
have you ever seen?

44:23.000 --> 44:24.583
Well, none.

44:24.750 --> 44:28.375
But I've also never seen a hare
with such gigantic floppy ears.

44:28.542 --> 44:31.458
- I mean, on an elephant.
- I can't fly!

44:32.583 --> 44:34.667
You can fly!

44:40.042 --> 44:42.083
See, I can't fly.

44:42.625 --> 44:45.250
I can't clear a bar
with my scent like you Meg.

44:45.708 --> 44:48.958
There's nothing good
about being me, okay?

44:49.667 --> 44:52.125
You've got a "me" problem.

44:55.375 --> 44:57.625
I think we got a "we" problem.

44:58.875 --> 44:59.875
Oh no!

45:43.292 --> 45:44.625
Pigmies?

45:48.042 --> 45:50.625
Heya! We come in peace.

45:50.792 --> 45:53.042
For the record,
I didn't wanna come at all.

45:53.208 --> 45:54.667
Blast 'em. Blast 'em all.

45:54.833 --> 45:57.417
Hold on, I can't,
I haven't recharged yet.

45:57.583 --> 46:00.500
"Haven't recharged!"
What happened to being special?

46:05.125 --> 46:07.542
Hey! That tickles!

46:09.167 --> 46:10.500
Behold!

46:11.250 --> 46:12.542
The Chickenhare!

46:12.708 --> 46:15.000
God of the land and sky!

46:15.292 --> 46:17.750
Flyer over short distances!

46:18.542 --> 46:20.917
Part chicken, part hare.

46:21.083 --> 46:22.667
Almighty!

46:39.333 --> 46:42.333
You are a god?

46:44.000 --> 46:45.083
Sure?

46:45.625 --> 46:47.625
That's good enough for me.

46:47.792 --> 46:50.042
Prepare the feast!

46:50.667 --> 46:52.125
See, "me" problem.

46:52.292 --> 46:53.375
Tonight,

46:53.542 --> 46:57.167
we shall ply
the almighty Chickenhare

46:57.333 --> 46:59.917
and his strange helpers

47:00.083 --> 47:02.958
with our finest banquet!

47:04.292 --> 47:07.917
And then, tomorrow at first light,

47:08.083 --> 47:10.458
we shall take them to our volcano,

47:11.625 --> 47:14.833
and sacrifice the god Chickenhare

47:15.083 --> 47:19.125
to our god…
Santoro the Stoic!

47:19.292 --> 47:21.542
I think you're just the thing

47:21.708 --> 47:26.500
to finally put a smile
on Santoro's face.

47:26.667 --> 47:27.917
Just to be clear,

47:28.500 --> 47:31.625
Chickenhare's the only one
going in the volcano, right?

47:45.958 --> 47:47.500
That meal was incredible.

47:47.667 --> 47:49.708
These guys know how
to throw a sacrifice.

47:50.125 --> 47:53.875
See, Meg, this is what happens
when I'm myself.

47:54.042 --> 47:56.583
Maybe we could take a break
from the pity party?

47:56.750 --> 47:59.292
Let me tell you
about a little skunk named…

47:59.458 --> 48:01.083
I don't know… "Peg."

48:01.625 --> 48:05.625
I love a good story,
especially after a meal like that.

48:05.958 --> 48:08.708
Growing up, nobody wanted
to have a play date with "Peg,"

48:08.875 --> 48:10.667
on account of her being a skunk.

48:10.833 --> 48:14.958
Even when she got cool new dolls,
and had goody bags for her birthday,

48:15.125 --> 48:16.792
<i>nobody came.</i>

48:16.958 --> 48:19.250
<i>She bathed twice a day,</i>
<i>didn't matter.</i>

48:19.417 --> 48:22.125
<i>So… she corked herself.</i>

48:22.292 --> 48:23.958
Ouch!

48:24.292 --> 48:25.875
Ouch is right.

48:26.292 --> 48:27.875
But that didn't work either.

48:28.042 --> 48:31.000
So naturally, "Peg" got angry…

48:31.167 --> 48:34.125
<i>Her parents wanted her anger channeled</i>
<i>into something positive.</i>

48:34.292 --> 48:36.500
<i>So, she got a black belt in karate…</i>

48:36.667 --> 48:38.083
<i>and Kung Fu…</i>

48:38.250 --> 48:39.667
<i>and Kendo…</i>

48:40.083 --> 48:41.958
<i>and seven other martial arts.</i>

48:42.125 --> 48:45.542
<i>But that didn't help either.</i>
<i>She was still angry.</i>

48:45.958 --> 48:49.833
<i>Deep down, "Peg" still wished</i>
<i>she was anything but a skunk.</i>

48:50.167 --> 48:53.583
<i>Until one day, when she went</i>
<i>on a field trip to the Royal Treasury,</i>

48:54.375 --> 48:59.083
<i>and then Billy Goat Jones,</i>
<i>the jerk who teased "Peg" the most,</i>

48:59.708 --> 49:01.417
<i>shut the door behind us.</i>

49:01.833 --> 49:04.583
<i>But the treasurer was</i>
<i>the only one with the combination.</i>

49:05.042 --> 49:07.292
<i>Know what happens</i>
<i>when a skunk fears for her life?</i>

49:07.458 --> 49:10.333
<i>Well, "Peg" was a skunk</i>
<i>who feared for her life</i>

49:10.500 --> 49:12.458
<i>and had been corked for 3 years.</i>

49:15.333 --> 49:17.292
<i>"Peg" saved everyone that day.</i>

49:17.458 --> 49:20.375
<i>And you were a big hero</i>
<i>and everyone loved you, Meg.</i>

49:21.625 --> 49:22.833
<i>I mean "Peg".</i>

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
<i>No, they treated me worse than ever.</i>

49:26.167 --> 49:29.042
But for the first time,
I didn't care.

49:29.208 --> 49:33.417
I realized the thing that I was corking,
wasn't something to be ashamed of.

49:33.583 --> 49:35.792
No, it's what made me special.

49:36.333 --> 49:39.000
Chickenhare, you're a corker.

49:39.167 --> 49:43.542
Until you blow open your treasury vault,
you won't know what makes you special.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.333
Nice story, Meg,

49:46.500 --> 49:48.500
and I liked the way
you changed your name

49:48.667 --> 49:50.583
to make it feel more universal.

49:50.750 --> 49:52.917
But when the volcano turns us to ash,

49:53.083 --> 49:56.792
it isn't gonna discriminate
between the corkers and the non-corkers.

49:56.958 --> 50:00.167
True. But they're not gonna
throw us in that volcano.

50:01.583 --> 50:03.667
- They're not?
- Nope.

50:03.833 --> 50:05.750
Because you're gonna break us out.

50:11.625 --> 50:14.292
- Are you sure about this?
- Trust me.

51:03.333 --> 51:04.333
Chickenhare.

51:11.125 --> 51:12.708
I'll be right back.

51:13.292 --> 51:14.292
No.

51:20.667 --> 51:21.667
Really?

51:33.375 --> 51:35.500
Chickenhare, don't.

51:41.125 --> 51:42.958
You don't need those.

52:27.333 --> 52:28.792
Well, you know,

52:28.958 --> 52:33.375
I always felt waiting
'til first light was a bit arbitrary.

52:33.583 --> 52:35.333
Take them to the volcano now!

52:35.500 --> 52:36.667
Put down your weapons,

52:36.833 --> 52:38.708
or your god gets it!

52:39.625 --> 52:40.625
Abe?

52:41.333 --> 52:42.958
Come on, guys, hurry up.

52:44.250 --> 52:47.250
Look how Santoro maintains his stoicism,

52:47.833 --> 52:50.792
even with a spear at his throat.

52:50.958 --> 52:55.208
Let's see how he maintains
his stoicism rolling down a hill!

52:55.542 --> 52:58.458
Now they'll all follow him
as we make our escape…

53:03.333 --> 53:05.625
- Or not.
- Get them!

53:09.708 --> 53:11.375
Oh great Santoro,

53:11.542 --> 53:14.667
your revenge is at hand!

53:21.500 --> 53:22.750
Watch out!

53:24.083 --> 53:26.667
This is not worth
perpetual three-day weekends!

53:29.708 --> 53:30.708
No, come here!

53:54.333 --> 53:56.958
- Please tell me you've recharged!
- I'm trying!

53:57.125 --> 53:58.625
Almost there.

54:04.083 --> 54:06.625
I'm really starting to think
you're not special at all,

54:06.792 --> 54:08.167
you just have an enormous ego!

54:08.458 --> 54:10.333
There we go, I'm back.

54:10.500 --> 54:11.708
Fire in the hole!

54:23.458 --> 54:24.833
Chickenhare!

54:38.542 --> 54:41.000
- Chickenhare! This way!
- Coming!

54:58.625 --> 55:00.750
Chickenhare!
Your moves have moves.

55:17.500 --> 55:19.083
Good work, Chickenhare.

55:19.250 --> 55:20.250
Did you see that?

55:25.208 --> 55:26.208
Let's go.

55:29.625 --> 55:30.667
Look!

55:30.833 --> 55:33.333
Woah, the mountain!

55:42.500 --> 55:44.042
Incoming!

55:48.875 --> 55:51.250
- Meg, get us across!
- I can't do it.

55:51.750 --> 55:53.500
I can't do it.
Last time I tried…

55:53.667 --> 55:56.250
Last time your jacket
was holding your arm back.

55:57.750 --> 55:59.208
You're almost here, Chickenhare.

56:03.625 --> 56:05.833
- I did it! Hang on!
- Here we go!

56:09.958 --> 56:10.958
Oh, please.

56:11.500 --> 56:12.875
No!

56:14.958 --> 56:17.125
You couldn't have brought
the extra-large whip,

56:17.292 --> 56:18.625
could you, Meg?

56:20.125 --> 56:21.500
I hate adventuring!

56:25.417 --> 56:27.500
Hey! It's even further than I thought.

56:46.583 --> 56:49.958
According to the map,
the temple's at the top of the mountain.

56:50.125 --> 56:51.125
We need a plan.

56:51.292 --> 56:53.542
Lapin is probably
halfway up there already.

56:53.708 --> 56:54.750
I have a plan!

56:55.083 --> 56:57.125
If we take the Nearly Impassable Pass,

56:57.583 --> 57:00.708
by the time the trails merge,
we should be ahead of them…

57:00.875 --> 57:02.708
Sounds like a genius plan to me.

57:02.875 --> 57:05.917
You know what? We might get
that Hamster of Darkness after all.

57:06.083 --> 57:10.333
What do you mean "might"?
Lapin's gonna eat our feather dust.

57:11.708 --> 57:12.708
Abe?

57:14.500 --> 57:16.500
This mud is actually very nutrient-rich.

57:17.083 --> 57:18.542
Uh, let's go.

57:18.708 --> 57:21.583
Hey, I wanna stop Lapin
as much as you,

57:21.750 --> 57:23.583
well maybe 10% as much as you,

57:23.750 --> 57:26.042
but can't we look good doing it?

57:47.042 --> 57:49.083
Here I am. You won't believe it.

57:49.250 --> 57:52.500
Chickenhare's heading up
the Nearly Impassable Pass!

57:52.667 --> 57:54.250
What? Impossible!

57:54.583 --> 57:58.000
No, again I think
it's more improbable than impossible.

57:58.167 --> 58:00.667
You know, I tell you what,
the way he's going,

58:01.167 --> 58:04.667
the Three Deadly Trials
won't be a problem for Chickenhare.

58:09.583 --> 58:11.500
Get the dynamite.

58:12.333 --> 58:13.458
Come on, Abe!

58:14.542 --> 58:16.083
We're closing in on them.

58:16.375 --> 58:17.625
Hello, I'm a turtle!

58:17.792 --> 58:21.500
Are you completely unaware
of my species' role in fables?

58:28.167 --> 58:29.167
You idiots!

58:29.333 --> 58:33.208
The avalanche was supposed
to take out Chickenhare, not us!

58:38.125 --> 58:40.833
It really is difficult
to find good help these days.

58:42.750 --> 58:43.833
Lapin!

58:44.333 --> 58:45.667
Lapin!

58:45.833 --> 58:47.458
Look, Lapin's a goner.

58:49.667 --> 58:51.750
I guess there's nothing we can do.

58:51.917 --> 58:52.917
Yeah there is.

58:56.875 --> 58:58.417
You're right,
nothing we can do.

58:58.583 --> 58:59.833
Oh, let's go.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.417
Sorry, guys.

59:13.375 --> 59:15.083
According to the legend,

59:15.250 --> 59:19.042
we're looking for a hamster face
etched in the ice.

59:33.708 --> 59:34.958
I got it!

59:36.375 --> 59:37.583
This way!

59:47.333 --> 59:49.333
Alright, we're going in.

59:49.500 --> 59:51.208
You read my mind, partner.

59:51.417 --> 59:53.958
Wait. Lapin's dead and buried.

59:54.125 --> 59:55.833
Probably not in that order.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.792
We saved the Kingdom.
We're done here. Let's go home.

59:58.958 --> 1:00:02.292
Abe, if I can bring back
the Hamster of Darkness,

1:00:02.458 --> 1:00:05.167
my dad will let me join
the Royal Adventure Society.

1:00:05.542 --> 1:00:07.583
Isn't it enough
that you made it this far?

1:00:07.750 --> 1:00:09.542
And who's gonna believe me?

1:00:09.708 --> 1:00:12.167
I need the hamster as proof.

1:00:12.333 --> 1:00:15.042
Now the only thing
standing between us and it

1:00:15.208 --> 1:00:17.042
are the Three Deadly Trials.

1:00:17.208 --> 1:00:19.458
Abe, if you wanna stay behind,
fine, but…

1:00:19.875 --> 1:00:21.125
I'm in!

1:00:26.542 --> 1:00:28.583
I've always been a follower.

1:00:29.125 --> 1:00:32.000
I want every other Thursday off too!

1:00:37.708 --> 1:00:41.167
"In order to enter
the Temple of the Hamster of Darkness,

1:00:41.333 --> 1:00:44.250
"one must pass the Three Deadly Trials."

1:00:44.417 --> 1:00:48.375
Why's it always three?
Why can't it ever be two trials?

1:00:51.708 --> 1:00:53.042
What's the first one?

1:00:53.208 --> 1:00:55.750
"We hamsters may be small of stature,

1:00:55.917 --> 1:00:57.875
"but we are cool under pressure.

1:00:58.042 --> 1:00:59.250
"We never lose our heads,

1:01:01.375 --> 1:01:04.583
"even when confronted
by imminent death."

1:01:04.750 --> 1:01:07.500
"Imminent death!"
That's how we start?

1:01:11.292 --> 1:01:13.375
Sadistic little rodents, aren't they?

1:01:19.917 --> 1:01:21.375
"Small of stature"…

1:01:27.583 --> 1:01:28.875
"Cool under pressure"…

1:01:40.750 --> 1:01:41.833
A secret passage!

1:01:42.292 --> 1:01:44.292
- Well done!
- Let's get out of here!

1:01:57.250 --> 1:01:59.042
What's the second trial?

1:01:59.708 --> 1:02:04.250
"Though we hamsters may not be so fleet
of foot to outrun our Destiny,

1:02:04.625 --> 1:02:07.042
"we do have the courage to face it."

1:02:07.625 --> 1:02:10.125
Enough with this fake
self-deprecating routine.

1:02:10.292 --> 1:02:13.042
Why couldn't these hamsters
hire shrinks like us?

1:02:19.917 --> 1:02:21.458
Run!

1:02:28.500 --> 1:02:30.500
Look, that's Ramon's wife!

1:02:30.667 --> 1:02:33.667
It's wonderful that you're an admirer
of the female form…

1:02:34.333 --> 1:02:37.125
His wife Destiny.
We have to stand here facing Destiny.

1:02:38.083 --> 1:02:39.583
Or… we can run!

1:02:39.750 --> 1:02:42.625
Meg, if you're gonna side with me
once before I die,

1:02:42.792 --> 1:02:44.458
you have 10 seconds.
9…

1:02:44.625 --> 1:02:45.625
I'm with Chickenhare.

1:02:47.750 --> 1:02:49.958
Miscalculated!
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1…

1:03:29.208 --> 1:03:31.792
Think these hamsters
had issues with being short?

1:03:32.125 --> 1:03:34.875
Do I even wanna ask
what the third trial is?

1:03:35.167 --> 1:03:37.458
All the legend says, is:
"Do this."

1:03:37.625 --> 1:03:38.625
Do what?

1:03:48.708 --> 1:03:50.875
That can't be it. Could it?

1:04:28.708 --> 1:04:31.292
Man, these hamsters
keep you off-balance.

1:04:42.792 --> 1:04:44.167
The scepter…

1:04:47.208 --> 1:04:48.208
We made it!

1:05:01.708 --> 1:05:03.792
I'm taking you home.

1:05:15.167 --> 1:05:17.917
The Hamster of Darkness.

1:05:20.500 --> 1:05:23.708
- But you…
- Were buried in that avalanche?

1:05:23.875 --> 1:05:26.542
Or did I make you think I was?

1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.625
See, I asked myself:

1:05:29.792 --> 1:05:33.000
Why should I try to pass
the Three Deadly Trials

1:05:33.167 --> 1:05:36.458
when my very eager nephew
would do it for me?

1:05:37.458 --> 1:05:38.667
Now give me that scepter.

1:05:38.833 --> 1:05:40.417
Don't do it. Don't give it to him!

1:05:41.292 --> 1:05:44.375
You're smart, Chickenhare.
I could use someone like you.

1:05:44.917 --> 1:05:48.542
You could be in charge
of my adventure society.

1:05:48.917 --> 1:05:50.958
We'll show everyone who laughs at us,

1:05:51.125 --> 1:05:54.792
take our revenge on those who'd shun us
because we're different.

1:05:54.958 --> 1:05:57.292
We're so alike, you and I.

1:05:58.125 --> 1:06:00.083
I'm nothing like you.

1:06:00.250 --> 1:06:03.167
But you are.
Because Chickenhare…

1:06:03.333 --> 1:06:04.625
I'm your father.

1:06:06.292 --> 1:06:08.167
I'm just kidding.
I'm not your father!

1:06:08.333 --> 1:06:10.625
But wouldn't it
have been crazy if I was,

1:06:10.792 --> 1:06:12.042
right?

1:06:13.250 --> 1:06:14.333
Give me that scepter or…

1:06:14.500 --> 1:06:17.250
One more step
and I'll throw it over the edge.

1:06:17.750 --> 1:06:20.042
Do it and I'll throw your friends over.

1:06:20.583 --> 1:06:22.083
Give it to him! Post haste.

1:06:22.417 --> 1:06:23.875
Do not call his bluff.

1:06:24.125 --> 1:06:26.458
Prisoners play a lot of poker!
A lot!

1:06:26.625 --> 1:06:29.458
If I give it to you,
you'll let them go?

1:06:29.792 --> 1:06:31.875
I'll let you all go.

1:06:32.042 --> 1:06:33.083
I swear it.

1:06:33.417 --> 1:06:35.417
Chickenhare, no, he's lying.

1:06:35.917 --> 1:06:39.083
Do you know the final piece
of the legend, Chickenhare?

1:06:40.500 --> 1:06:42.500
"He who releases the Hamster of Darkness

1:06:43.583 --> 1:06:46.083
"shall be followed for all of his days."

1:06:49.417 --> 1:06:51.625
That's right, little freak.

1:07:00.333 --> 1:07:02.708
I, Lapin the IX,

1:07:02.875 --> 1:07:04.625
call upon you

1:07:04.958 --> 1:07:07.375
to bring the darkness.

1:07:25.375 --> 1:07:26.833
What have I done?

1:07:33.667 --> 1:07:36.208
Now what do you say
we go take back my kingdom?

1:07:36.417 --> 1:07:40.667
- What about the freak and his friends?
- I promised I'd let them go.

1:07:40.833 --> 1:07:42.958
So, let them go… over the edge.

1:07:43.500 --> 1:07:44.958
Darn semantics…

1:07:52.625 --> 1:07:55.458
I have good news and bad news.

1:07:55.958 --> 1:07:58.167
The bad news is that
you should freeze to death

1:07:58.333 --> 1:08:00.750
in about 12 hours.

1:08:00.917 --> 1:08:03.125
Really? I think
it's gonna be much quicker.

1:08:03.292 --> 1:08:04.542
What's the good news?

1:08:04.708 --> 1:08:07.958
Please be that they're sending
a rope down for us.

1:08:08.125 --> 1:08:11.583
The good news is you'll live longer
than your father, Chickenhare.

1:08:12.292 --> 1:08:13.917
I wouldn't call that good news.

1:08:14.083 --> 1:08:16.125
Maybe slightly better news…

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:25.500
We found nothing.

1:08:25.667 --> 1:08:28.250
It was just another
of my brother's tricks.

1:08:28.417 --> 1:08:30.417
Hope for the best
and prepare for the worst.

1:08:30.583 --> 1:08:33.167
If Lapin got to the scepter,
things could get rough.

1:08:33.458 --> 1:08:36.167
Go and take shelter in the dungeon.

1:08:39.750 --> 1:08:42.292
<i>Dad, I've gone to stop Lapin.</i>

1:08:42.458 --> 1:08:45.667
<i>I know I'm not an Adventurer like you,</i>
<i>but I'll try my best.</i>

1:08:45.833 --> 1:08:47.417
<i>I'm sorry for all this.</i>

1:08:47.583 --> 1:08:50.125
<i>I love you, Chickenhare.</i>

1:08:56.333 --> 1:08:57.542
This is all my fault.

1:08:57.708 --> 1:09:01.875
You know what? You're right!
It is all your fault! 100%!

1:09:02.125 --> 1:09:04.292
We could've gone home now, but no,

1:09:04.458 --> 1:09:06.375
you needed to find
the Hamster of Darkness.

1:09:06.542 --> 1:09:09.167
- So everyone would forget you're…
- A freak?

1:09:10.417 --> 1:09:13.750
I thought bringing it back
would make them accept me.

1:09:15.333 --> 1:09:16.958
It's not all your fault.

1:09:17.125 --> 1:09:19.458
It's Meg's fault too.
She's a terrible influence.

1:09:19.833 --> 1:09:23.042
And I wasn't gonna say "freak."
I was gonna say "Chickenhare."

1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:25.333
- Same thing.
- No, they're not.

1:09:25.750 --> 1:09:28.875
Look at me!
Why couldn't I just be normal?

1:09:29.042 --> 1:09:32.417
Lapin never would've escaped,
and I wouldn't've come all this way.

1:09:32.833 --> 1:09:36.500
Because you're not normal!
Pretending you were only made it worse.

1:09:37.042 --> 1:09:39.917
But when you got rid of that costume
and became you…

1:09:40.292 --> 1:09:41.708
You found the Hamster of Darkness.

1:09:41.875 --> 1:09:45.250
The treasure that no adventurer
could find for thousands of years.

1:09:45.542 --> 1:09:47.875
Yeah, Lapin never would've found it
without you.

1:09:48.042 --> 1:09:50.083
I'm trying to let it go,
but I can't.

1:09:50.250 --> 1:09:53.000
Look, all of us are born with things
that make us different.

1:09:53.167 --> 1:09:55.792
The only choice we have
is how we see those things.

1:09:56.083 --> 1:09:59.958
So, we can either be ashamed of them
or we can embrace them

1:10:00.125 --> 1:10:01.875
and recognize that our differences
make us…

1:10:02.042 --> 1:10:03.250
Special.

1:10:05.958 --> 1:10:07.458
- No!
- Chickenhare!

1:10:36.458 --> 1:10:37.458
Really?

1:10:44.542 --> 1:10:46.000
Come on, Abe.

1:10:47.208 --> 1:10:48.625
They're too far ahead.

1:10:48.792 --> 1:10:51.125
By the time we get to your kingdom,
it'll be too late.

1:10:51.458 --> 1:10:54.458
We've come too far.
There's gotta be a way.

1:10:54.625 --> 1:10:56.833
- I have a plan.
- You have a plan?

1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.042
I have my moments.

1:10:59.417 --> 1:11:00.917
My secret shame.

1:11:01.083 --> 1:11:03.000
I was born without a shell.

1:11:03.167 --> 1:11:06.542
This one's my Uncle Herb's…
Love you Uncle Herbie!

1:11:09.708 --> 1:11:12.875
What? It's not like I got feathers
growing out of my head.

1:11:13.042 --> 1:11:14.458
It's not that.

1:11:14.625 --> 1:11:16.583
It's just that…

1:11:16.875 --> 1:11:19.375
you're really pale.

1:11:20.125 --> 1:11:21.750
That is unattractive.

1:11:22.250 --> 1:11:24.417
Anyway, who's ready to ride?

1:11:28.375 --> 1:11:30.750
- Should've used less wax!
- Get down!

1:11:32.875 --> 1:11:33.875
Watch out!

1:11:43.042 --> 1:11:44.250
Alright!

1:11:44.417 --> 1:11:46.667
- We're gonna catch Lapin.
- Or not.

1:11:51.375 --> 1:11:53.125
I hate adventuring.

1:11:59.042 --> 1:12:00.792
Sir, Lapin's at the gate.

1:12:01.083 --> 1:12:03.042
He requests to see you.

1:12:03.750 --> 1:12:05.417
Let's settle this!

1:12:11.708 --> 1:12:15.500
Not another step forward, Brother,
until you tell me where my son is.

1:12:16.833 --> 1:12:19.708
You mean that worthless
little half-breed freak?

1:12:19.875 --> 1:12:21.792
He's not coming back.

1:12:21.958 --> 1:12:24.125
I made quite sure of that.

1:12:26.042 --> 1:12:27.208
Hold it.

1:12:27.375 --> 1:12:30.500
Brother, please. Where is my son?

1:12:32.708 --> 1:12:34.750
I assume by now he's frozen to death

1:12:34.917 --> 1:12:36.500
on the side of the cliff
I threw him over.

1:12:36.667 --> 1:12:37.667
No!

1:12:38.250 --> 1:12:39.250
The scepter?

1:12:39.625 --> 1:12:42.000
That's right! I found it.

1:12:42.792 --> 1:12:44.750
Ah, technically Chickenhare found…

1:12:44.917 --> 1:12:47.458
Enough talk. Hamsters, attack!

1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:10.792
Sounds like a lost cause.

1:13:10.958 --> 1:13:12.625
My favorite kind.

1:13:12.792 --> 1:13:14.583
Meg, I'll need your whip.

1:13:14.750 --> 1:13:16.042
Thought you'd never ask.

1:13:27.500 --> 1:13:29.167
We can sneak up on Lapin.

1:13:29.333 --> 1:13:32.417
That's a terrible plan,
he's got a million hamsters.

1:13:32.583 --> 1:13:33.625
Lance, Whitey!

1:13:33.792 --> 1:13:35.625
Chickenhare!
We thought you were dead.

1:13:35.792 --> 1:13:38.625
Nope. Alive and kicking with these.

1:13:38.792 --> 1:13:40.750
So, where do we stand?

1:13:41.500 --> 1:13:43.542
It looks pretty hopeless.

1:13:43.708 --> 1:13:44.833
We gotta get down there.

1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:48.167
We gotta figure out a way
to get past those million hamsters.

1:13:48.333 --> 1:13:49.625
With big tails.

1:13:50.167 --> 1:13:52.458
What? I was born without a shell.

1:13:52.792 --> 1:13:55.750
A dose of skepticism
has been essential to my survival.

1:13:56.708 --> 1:13:58.583
That's how we sneak up on Lapin!

1:13:58.750 --> 1:14:02.875
- With my skepticism?
- No, with your shell.

1:14:03.042 --> 1:14:06.667
Well, at least we know your plan's
not the worst one, Whitey.

1:14:07.667 --> 1:14:09.667
Mine, at long last.

1:14:12.458 --> 1:14:13.917
Perfect fit.

1:14:14.542 --> 1:14:17.542
Actually, I'll need
to have it taken in a little

1:14:17.708 --> 1:14:21.250
because you have
such a big fat head, Brother.

1:14:21.708 --> 1:14:23.625
Maybe you're not so perfect
after all.

1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.000
What?

1:14:30.167 --> 1:14:33.042
Peg, say hello
to my little smelly friend!

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.750
Hey, Chickenhare's plan worked!

1:14:46.500 --> 1:14:47.667
Chickenhare!

1:14:48.625 --> 1:14:49.625
You?

1:14:49.792 --> 1:14:54.500
Hamsters, I command you to fight no more
and return to the scepter.

1:14:56.833 --> 1:14:58.250
I mean it.

1:14:58.417 --> 1:14:59.417
I'm serious.

1:14:59.792 --> 1:15:01.708
I command you!

1:15:02.667 --> 1:15:03.958
Please…

1:15:06.208 --> 1:15:07.417
Fool!

1:15:07.583 --> 1:15:10.250
That scepter is nothing without me.

1:15:10.625 --> 1:15:12.917
"For he who releases
the Hamster of Darkness

1:15:13.083 --> 1:15:15.833
"shall be followed for all of his days."

1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:17.417
The power's already mine.

1:15:17.583 --> 1:15:19.792
That's not true. Without the scepter,

1:15:19.958 --> 1:15:21.750
he will lose his power.

1:15:21.917 --> 1:15:23.292
Then I'll get rid of it.

1:15:23.833 --> 1:15:24.833
Hamsters…

1:15:25.250 --> 1:15:26.708
Run, Chickenhare!

1:15:26.875 --> 1:15:28.083
Attack!

1:15:43.250 --> 1:15:44.375
Now what?

1:15:44.958 --> 1:15:47.667
What are you waiting for?
Break that wall!

1:16:14.292 --> 1:16:17.042
Get the scepter, now,
before he throws it in the pit!

1:16:30.208 --> 1:16:31.875
Hamsters, the wheel!

1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.875
Okay, Chickenhare,
that's how you want to play it,

1:16:44.042 --> 1:16:46.833
then let's do it my way.

1:17:02.625 --> 1:17:03.667
How does it look?

1:17:07.792 --> 1:17:08.917
That wasn't there before.

1:17:23.792 --> 1:17:26.750
Hey rodents,
come and get us if you dare!

1:17:32.708 --> 1:17:33.917
Hi there.

1:18:08.958 --> 1:18:09.958
Look at him!

1:18:10.125 --> 1:18:13.542
Get me the scepter
if you want to fly another day.

1:18:26.250 --> 1:18:27.333
Come on!

1:18:42.250 --> 1:18:43.917
Game over, Lapin.

1:18:44.083 --> 1:18:47.333
No it's not,
we're just about to get started.

1:19:23.958 --> 1:19:25.792
Catch me if you can!

1:19:26.500 --> 1:19:29.292
- Let's finish this, Brother.
- Not so fast.

1:19:32.625 --> 1:19:33.917
Hamsters, charge!

1:19:40.292 --> 1:19:43.000
Finish him, Chickenhare's mine.

1:20:21.125 --> 1:20:22.625
Give me that!

1:20:39.375 --> 1:20:40.375
Good riddance.

1:21:02.542 --> 1:21:03.667
Uncle!

1:21:20.917 --> 1:21:22.958
I got you, come on.

1:21:29.792 --> 1:21:31.583
Chickenhare, no!

1:21:32.042 --> 1:21:34.958
Fly chicken, fly.

1:21:53.375 --> 1:21:57.542
If I'm going down,
at least I'm taking you with me.

1:22:02.667 --> 1:22:03.708
What?

1:22:03.875 --> 1:22:05.583
Impossible!

1:22:34.708 --> 1:22:36.500
Hey, guys, I'm back!

1:22:36.667 --> 1:22:38.333
Alright, you did it!

1:22:38.583 --> 1:22:41.042
Did you see that? I can fly!

1:22:41.708 --> 1:22:44.500
I wouldn't call that flying,
more like gliding.

1:22:44.958 --> 1:22:46.750
Abe, cork it, will you?

1:22:46.917 --> 1:22:48.125
Chickenhare,

1:22:48.292 --> 1:22:49.542
you found it.

1:22:50.292 --> 1:22:51.833
Yeah, but Lapin took it and…

1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.500
Not the Hamster of Darkness,
Chickenhare.

1:22:54.667 --> 1:22:55.875
You.

1:22:56.208 --> 1:22:57.458
You found you.

1:22:59.833 --> 1:23:01.208
I'm glad.

1:23:02.458 --> 1:23:04.042
Me too, Dad.

1:23:06.042 --> 1:23:08.292
A hare who can fly.

1:23:08.458 --> 1:23:10.000
How cool is this?

1:23:10.167 --> 1:23:13.583
What are you talking about?
He can fly because he's a chicken.

1:23:13.750 --> 1:23:15.333
What? He's a hare.

1:23:15.500 --> 1:23:16.500
- Chicken.
- Hare.

1:23:16.667 --> 1:23:17.792
- Chicken.
- Hare.

1:23:20.042 --> 1:23:21.542
So what'd I miss?

1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:24.292
Hey!

1:23:24.542 --> 1:23:26.417
What do you want from me?
I just…

1:23:33.458 --> 1:23:34.458
Chickenhare?

1:23:39.833 --> 1:23:40.833
Chickenhare.

1:23:41.750 --> 1:23:43.167
I knew it.

1:23:47.750 --> 1:23:50.292
Chickenhare, what are you doing?

1:23:50.750 --> 1:23:54.125
Guys, I just discovered the location
of the holy spork!

1:23:54.625 --> 1:23:56.417
We leave in 5 minutes.

1:23:56.583 --> 1:24:00.083
But they're just about to start
bringing out the hors d'oeuvres.

1:24:00.500 --> 1:24:02.042
But what about your induction?

1:24:02.208 --> 1:24:04.042
This is what you've wanted
your whole life.

1:24:04.208 --> 1:24:05.667
Sorry, Dad, don't have time.

1:24:05.833 --> 1:24:09.375
Hold on, Chickenhare.
You can't leave…

1:24:09.875 --> 1:24:11.000
without this.

1:24:16.833 --> 1:24:18.625
Your golden machete.

1:24:19.042 --> 1:24:21.000
You really mean this?

1:24:21.542 --> 1:24:23.375
I love you, Dad.

1:24:25.542 --> 1:24:28.417
Now, go get that holy spork.

1:24:44.333 --> 1:24:47.792
What are the odds
both of my best friends are masochists?

1:24:51.792 --> 1:24:52.792
Hey!

1:30:54.458 --> 1:30:57.000
