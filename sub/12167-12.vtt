WEBVTT

00:14.344 --> 00:17.180
- Ease up on the controls a little.
- I'm fine.

00:17.347 --> 00:19.599
You're gonna snap the damn things off.

00:19.766 --> 00:23.228
- I'm just seeing what this baby can do.
- "This baby"?

00:23.395 --> 00:25.856
It's appropriate space-pilot parlance.

00:26.022 --> 00:30.444
- Try to fly the baby in a straight line.
- I'm flying in a straight line.

00:34.698 --> 00:39.411
- Not so much.
- Well, in space, all motion is relative.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.669
You OK, Dr Gall?

00:47.836 --> 00:49.713
I get motion sickness.

00:51.339 --> 00:54.217
These have inertial dampeners.
You don't feel a thing.

00:54.384 --> 00:57.262
I know we're moving.
That's enough for me.

01:01.433 --> 01:03.894
Why'd you choose this guy
for the mission?

01:04.061 --> 01:06.938
Brendan discovered
the Lagrangian Point satellite.

01:07.105 --> 01:08.982
Elizabeth felt he should see it.

01:09.149 --> 01:11.860
- Don't let go!
- Snapping doesn't help!

01:12.027 --> 01:15.155
This is why parents
don't teach their kids how to drive.

01:15.322 --> 01:18.367
I'm both insulted and touched by that.

01:21.453 --> 01:23.538
Oh, my God!

01:41.098 --> 01:43.809
- McKay.
- Yes, of course, please.

01:50.982 --> 01:53.360
Holding station at 1,000 metres.

01:53.527 --> 01:56.446
Half a mile away
and it's filling the windshield.

01:56.613 --> 02:01.451
This might be the single largest
weapons platform ever constructed.

02:01.618 --> 02:04.079
The last line of defence before Atlantis.

02:04.246 --> 02:07.999
Any chance it's still operational?
That would be very good.

02:09.751 --> 02:12.045
- Any energy readings?
- Negative.

02:12.212 --> 02:17.884
- So it's dead?
- It warrants closer scrutiny, but... yeah.

02:18.051 --> 02:20.554
Knocked out
during the Ancients' last stand?

02:20.721 --> 02:24.891
Or its power source is depleted.
We should still take a closer look.

02:25.058 --> 02:29.646
Wait. I'm getting something
on the ultra-low frequency range.

02:29.813 --> 02:33.650
<i>(screeching)</i>

02:34.443 --> 02:37.237
Where's it coming from?

02:38.989 --> 02:41.658
The planet.

02:41.825 --> 02:43.910
It's a distress call.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.581
A Wraith distress call.

04:01.613 --> 04:04.032
<i>(Weir) Wraith? In this solar system?</i>

04:04.199 --> 04:06.326
I know. It's right in our backyard.

04:06.493 --> 04:10.706
We figure the Ancients shot the ship down
in the final battle for Atlantis.

04:10.872 --> 04:13.417
And it's still putting out a signal?

04:13.583 --> 04:16.753
A very weak signal.
If any part of that ship is intact,

04:16.920 --> 04:20.589
the wealth of knowledge
we could acquire is invaluable.

04:20.757 --> 04:24.052
- What are you saying?
- We have to go and take a look.

04:24.219 --> 04:29.474
You have to?
It took you almost 15 hours to get there.

04:29.641 --> 04:32.519
All the more reason to look.
We're already here.

04:32.686 --> 04:36.440
The planet's atmosphere
is extremely ionised.

04:36.606 --> 04:39.484
Radio communication could be difficult.

04:39.651 --> 04:43.572
<i>And it would take at least 15 hours
to send out any sort of rescue.</i>

04:43.739 --> 04:46.575
<i>- We'll be fine.
- (Weir) Major?.</i>

04:46.742 --> 04:49.453
- I agree with McKay.
- Of course you do.

04:49.619 --> 04:52.956
How could you resist exploring
a crashed alien spaceship?

04:53.123 --> 04:56.752
- Exactly.
- Our interest is purely professional.

04:56.918 --> 05:01.214
The intel we can gather from
their weapons system, codes, shields...

05:01.381 --> 05:04.217
All right.
Proceed with extreme caution, please.

05:04.384 --> 05:07.262
- Check in with me in three hours.
- Three hours?

05:07.429 --> 05:10.515
Will do. Jumper One out.

05:16.063 --> 05:19.858
- "Communication could be difficult."
- She said yes, didn't she?

05:20.025 --> 05:23.528
- And no thanks to you.
- All right, knock it off, guys.

05:23.695 --> 05:26.990
I've spent the last 15 hours
listening to you two.

05:31.536 --> 05:33.622
Are we ready?

05:36.124 --> 05:39.711
All right, let's remember where we parked.

05:44.674 --> 05:47.803
- Why didn't we land next to the ship?
- A precaution.

05:47.969 --> 05:51.139
The Wraith ship
crashed thousands of years ago.

05:51.306 --> 05:54.226
<i>- Automated defences.
- (Gall) I never thought of that.</i>

05:54.393 --> 05:58.397
Brendan, we weren't all built for fieldwork.

05:58.563 --> 06:03.360
<i>- Seriously, we're almost there, right?
- (buzzing)</i>

06:03.527 --> 06:05.612
What's that?

06:06.780 --> 06:08.949
Some kind of a bug?

06:09.116 --> 06:11.284
Space bug.

06:11.451 --> 06:14.621
It's giving off
a pretty strong life-signs reading.

06:14.788 --> 06:17.666
- I'm allergic to bee stings.
- It smells the food.

06:17.833 --> 06:21.753
Maybe he's just smelling the girlish fear.

06:21.920 --> 06:26.675
Well, let's leave it be...
and it'll leave us be.

06:30.011 --> 06:32.097
Guys...

06:49.614 --> 06:53.869
- Have you seen one like this before?
- It's too small to be a hive ship.

06:54.036 --> 06:57.831
<i>(McKay) It's been here a long time.
Maybe they discontinued that model.</i>

06:57.998 --> 07:02.836
Maybe, but whatever it is,
it took a hell of a hit.

07:03.003 --> 07:06.631
Score one for the Ancient satellite.

07:09.217 --> 07:13.305
There are skeletons down there.
I guess everyone didn't die in the crash.

07:13.472 --> 07:16.433
- Any life signs?
- I think we can rule that out.

07:16.600 --> 07:20.020
- Just a precaution.
- Fine.

07:24.816 --> 07:30.238
- Us and the bugs. Nothing from the ship.
- Good. Let's go take a look.

07:48.882 --> 07:51.426
Picking up faint power readings.

07:51.593 --> 07:54.721
Something had to be powering
the distress beacon.

08:12.197 --> 08:14.074
Come on, Abrams.

08:14.241 --> 08:17.869
Maybe one of us should stay outside.

08:18.036 --> 08:20.122
Look, I know how you feel,

08:20.288 --> 08:24.167
but how many opportunities like this
are we gonna get?

08:56.033 --> 08:59.703
- Looks like he just lay down and died.
- It's remarkably preserved.

08:59.870 --> 09:06.209
Or it wasn't that long ago.
All right, Beckett'll want samples.

09:15.093 --> 09:17.846
It is, uh...? Yeah.

09:21.183 --> 09:23.268
OK...

09:27.773 --> 09:33.361
- What the...?
- OK. This is different.

09:33.528 --> 09:36.615
- Wraith cannibalism?
- Looks like it.

09:36.782 --> 09:39.993
- They feed off each other?
- Probably as a last resort.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.704
They tried to survive as long as possible.

09:42.871 --> 09:48.210
- OK, that is incredibly disturbing.
- No kidding.

09:48.377 --> 09:51.505
<i>- You know, I wonder if there's...
- (Gall) Guys!</i>

10:08.939 --> 10:12.401
<i>(Gall) They're bodies, human bodies.</i>

10:13.318 --> 10:15.904
They have chambers like this
on hive ships.

10:16.071 --> 10:19.908
- I've never seen one so large before.
- I don't understand.

10:20.075 --> 10:26.790
The Wraith cocoon humans, keep them in
suspended animation, so later they can...

10:26.957 --> 10:29.626
I think we just figured out
what this ship is for.

10:29.793 --> 10:34.297
A supply ship on its way to feed the Wraith
who were laying siege to Atlantis.

10:34.464 --> 10:38.135
- That's terrifying.
- Gall, Abrams, check it out, but be careful.

10:38.301 --> 10:40.470
- What? Wait.
- Where are you going?

10:40.637 --> 10:43.140
To the bridge.
Maybe we can get some intel.

10:43.306 --> 10:46.268
- You're leaving us?
- They're all dead.

10:46.435 --> 10:49.604
- That's the problem!
- Just get a rough head count.

10:49.771 --> 10:53.108
- We'll stay in radio contact.
- That could be difficult.

10:53.275 --> 10:58.530
- This part of the ship seems shielded.
- Weir only gave us a few hours.

10:58.697 --> 11:03.368
You wanted fieldwork. This is fieldwork.

11:21.261 --> 11:24.556
Lieutenant, put a team on stand-by
for a rescue mission.

11:24.723 --> 11:27.392
- Is the major all right?
- Everything's fine.

11:27.559 --> 11:29.686
I'd just like to have a team ready.

11:29.853 --> 11:33.815
- So, just in case?
- Yeah. Just in case.

11:35.192 --> 11:37.277
Yes, ma'am.

11:43.575 --> 11:47.412
<i>(McKay) I'm not picking up anything
in the EM spectrum.</i>

11:47.579 --> 11:52.209
I may need to rig up a secondary power
source to interface with their computer.

11:52.376 --> 11:55.170
<i>- (Sheppard) I'm just thinking out loud.
- What?</i>

11:55.337 --> 11:58.298
How long could the Wraith
feed on all those humans?

11:58.465 --> 12:01.760
They're capable of hibernating
for hundreds of years,

12:01.927 --> 12:05.972
but 10,000 years ago was roughly
the dawn of human civilisation.

12:06.139 --> 12:11.228
- So there's no chance that...?
- No. Are you kidding? Well... maybe.

12:13.271 --> 12:15.857
- McKay.
- No.

12:16.024 --> 12:21.238
No living thing could survive that long
under those conditions. It's ridiculous.

12:23.156 --> 12:24.533
OK.

12:24.700 --> 12:28.203
It would require an incredible
power source to sustain the humans

12:28.370 --> 12:31.873
in suspended animation
almost the entire time.

12:32.040 --> 12:36.211
- So it's possible?
- Oh, my God. It is possible.

12:37.838 --> 12:40.340
We gotta get outta here.

12:42.676 --> 12:45.387
<i>Gall, Abrams, this is Sheppard.</i>

12:46.471 --> 12:48.724
Are you trying to scare me to death?

12:48.890 --> 12:51.977
<i>I'm probably being overcautious,
but we should...</i>

12:52.144 --> 12:55.105
<i>- (static)
- We need to what?</i>

12:55.272 --> 12:57.441
Say again. Your radio's breaking up.

12:57.607 --> 13:02.988
Fall back to our point of ingress.
We're headed back to the jumper.

13:05.157 --> 13:07.826
I think we're getting outta here.

13:07.993 --> 13:10.454
- What?
- I just saw something behind you.

13:10.620 --> 13:13.206
We can't go that way.
Major, I saw something.

13:15.667 --> 13:19.046
All right, stay put.
We're coming back to you.

13:19.755 --> 13:22.466
Understood. There's nothing out here.

13:22.632 --> 13:25.510
- You're freaking out on me.
- I saw something.

13:25.677 --> 13:28.263
- Put that thing away.
- I know what I saw!

13:32.225 --> 13:34.311
Oh, my God.

13:41.693 --> 13:44.863
<i>(Wraith screeching)</i>

13:50.243 --> 13:53.038
This way.

14:26.279 --> 14:29.032
- He's dead.
- Where's Gall?

14:29.199 --> 14:31.326
I don't know.

14:31.493 --> 14:35.330
- Gall, this is Sheppard. Come in.
- It must have taken him.

14:38.291 --> 14:41.336
You're right. They're on the move.

14:41.503 --> 14:45.257
- What are you doing?
- Taking his weapons and his ammo.

14:45.424 --> 14:48.135
- I already have a gun.
- Now you have two.

14:49.177 --> 14:52.055
- You're not going after the Wraith?
- After Gall.

14:52.222 --> 14:54.891
Then I plan on getting the hell outta here.

14:55.058 --> 14:57.394
I swear there were no life signs.

14:57.561 --> 15:01.606
They don't show up as life signs
when they're hibernating.

15:03.233 --> 15:05.944
OK. Let's go.

15:10.532 --> 15:12.617
<i>(breathy grunting)</i>

15:24.963 --> 15:28.467
<i>(breathy grunting continues)</i>

15:28.633 --> 15:30.719
<i>(gasps)</i>

15:31.887 --> 15:33.263
Please!

15:36.183 --> 15:38.268
<i>(snarls)</i>

15:44.107 --> 15:46.860
- They're not even overdue.
- It doesn't matter.

15:47.027 --> 15:51.782
Call it intuition, paranoia, or just a drill.
Either way, I want you to go now.

15:51.948 --> 15:56.620
- If they are in trouble...
- Then every moment counts. Exactly.

15:56.787 --> 15:58.663
- Who's your pilot?
- Markham.

15:58.830 --> 16:03.210
- Good. He could use some practice.
- I have ordnance to fight a small war.

16:03.377 --> 16:06.296
- Let's hope you don't have to.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:07.631 --> 16:09.716
Let's move out.

16:22.229 --> 16:24.731
- What's that?
- I don't know.

16:24.898 --> 16:30.320
But I don't have the ordnance
I should have. I'll take any edge I can get.

16:34.241 --> 16:37.994
What world are you from?

16:38.161 --> 16:40.455
You're gonna kill me anyway.

16:41.415 --> 16:44.376
You have come here by ship.

16:44.543 --> 16:46.920
Where is it?

16:47.087 --> 16:49.297
You're gonna kill me anyway.

16:52.092 --> 16:56.221
But not all at once.

16:57.681 --> 16:59.599
Agh!

17:01.518 --> 17:03.812
OK.

17:03.979 --> 17:07.315
Stay behind me.
Shoot only when I tell you to shoot.

17:17.826 --> 17:20.871
<i>(running footsteps)</i>

17:26.460 --> 17:28.545
<i>(whimpers)</i>

17:35.510 --> 17:37.596
- I'm sorry.
- Sh!

17:42.517 --> 17:44.603
He's left the ship.

17:51.068 --> 17:53.820
- It killed Abrams.
- We know.

17:55.364 --> 17:58.283
It was so fast. It fed off me.

17:58.450 --> 18:03.038
- You're gonna be all right.
- It was taking my life. I could feel it.

18:03.205 --> 18:05.207
Listen to me. You're still here.

18:07.084 --> 18:10.170
Can you move?

18:10.337 --> 18:14.758
- Nothing below my shoulders.
- I'm sure the paralysis is just temporary.

18:14.925 --> 18:19.304
I told him where we left the jumper.
He took my remote.

18:20.222 --> 18:22.974
- He won't be able to fly it.
- Do we know that?

18:23.141 --> 18:27.312
I'm sure the Wraith were the reason
the technology only works with the gene.

18:27.479 --> 18:31.149
- He'll have our weapons, food and water.
- Who cares?

18:31.316 --> 18:35.570
What if he can use our subspace radio
to signal his friends?

18:35.737 --> 18:38.490
- He might do that.
- Not if I get there first.

18:38.657 --> 18:40.575
- He's got a head start.
- I'm fast.

18:40.742 --> 18:43.829
- Elizabeth will send a jumper...
- Stay with him.

18:43.995 --> 18:46.289
No. Please don't leave us.

18:46.456 --> 18:49.167
- We should stick together.
- He killed Abrams.

18:49.334 --> 18:51.670
Just because we both made an error...

18:51.837 --> 18:55.006
I don't have time to argue about this!

18:55.173 --> 18:59.678
Now, set your radio to channel two,
but don't use it till you hear from me.

18:59.845 --> 19:02.180
Major! Major!

19:05.934 --> 19:08.061
It's fine. Just...

19:08.228 --> 19:10.647
OK.

19:48.477 --> 19:51.313
- Anything?
- No.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.191
Hopefully there's just the one.

19:55.650 --> 19:59.237
- You're not gonna let me die out here?
- Don't be ridiculous.

19:59.404 --> 20:02.074
You know, 'cause people would talk.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.826
- And why would they do that?
- It's obvious.

20:04.993 --> 20:09.456
You're afraid I'll outshine you.
My mind. My youth.

20:14.795 --> 20:17.172
- How much did he take?
- You look fine.

20:17.339 --> 20:21.510
That's what they do, isn't it?
They take years off your life.

20:21.676 --> 20:24.096
I look old, don't I?

20:24.262 --> 20:26.139
You look older, yes.

20:28.475 --> 20:31.436
- Show me.
- There's no point in doing this.

20:31.603 --> 20:34.689
Rodney, show me.

20:48.620 --> 20:51.081
Oh, my God!

20:51.248 --> 20:55.377
I don't know how it works, Brendan.
Maybe you haven't really aged.

20:55.544 --> 20:59.840
It's possible that in time you could
get better. You're still alive.

21:04.636 --> 21:07.139
Can you move yet?

21:09.141 --> 21:13.228
- I think I'm getting some feeling back.
- Well, there's something.

21:16.022 --> 21:19.651
What? I'm just trying to help here.

21:19.818 --> 21:24.239
You're the one who had to find
the stupid satellite.

21:24.406 --> 21:30.370
- Agh! Don't make me laugh.
- You shouldn't laugh. It's not so good.

22:18.377 --> 22:20.879
<i>(roars)</i>

22:42.025 --> 22:44.444
<i>(Weir) They still haven't checked in.</i>

22:44.611 --> 22:48.031
- Good thing we left when we did.
- Be careful, Lieutenant.

22:48.198 --> 22:49.574
Yes, ma'am.

22:49.741 --> 22:52.160
<i>Gall said radio was a problem
on the surface.</i>

22:52.327 --> 22:55.706
<i>Hopefully the jumper's
subspace communications are just down.</i>

22:55.872 --> 22:57.958
We'll do whatever we need to do.

22:58.125 --> 23:03.088
You're on the other side of
the solar system. It's gonna be your call.

23:03.255 --> 23:04.923
Yes, ma'am, it is.

23:09.469 --> 23:11.638
<i>(Sheppard) McKay.</i>

23:11.805 --> 23:15.559
- Still here.
- Son of a bitch beat me to it. He's fast.

23:15.726 --> 23:17.602
<i>- Then get back here.
- Negative.</i>

23:17.769 --> 23:20.397
<i>- There's no point being there.
- He's on my ship.</i>

23:20.564 --> 23:22.983
Are you Captain Kirk?
What good'll it do him?

23:23.150 --> 23:29.322
Maybe he can hot-wire the damn thing.
I don't wanna take a chance.

23:34.911 --> 23:37.873
Any idea how long the days are
on this planet?

23:38.040 --> 23:39.583
<i>No. Why?</i>

23:39.750 --> 23:43.837
I've got a feeling the nights
are pretty damn cold, sub-zero cold.

23:44.004 --> 23:47.466
We're six hours overdue.
Assuming they waited an hour...

23:47.632 --> 23:50.427
<i>It's gonna be dark
before a jumper can get here.</i>

23:50.594 --> 23:54.973
If we play the waiting game, the guy who's
been around for 10,000 years will win.

23:55.140 --> 23:59.603
Anyone or anything capable of surviving
that long is a serious adversary.

23:59.770 --> 24:03.648
Not if I get him out in the open.
He won't know about our weapons.

24:03.815 --> 24:07.027
If all goes well,
I'll fly back and pick you up.

24:07.194 --> 24:11.031
And if all doesn't go well?
Things haven't gone well thus far.

24:11.198 --> 24:14.826
<i>You know, these guys do die
if you have enough firepower.</i>

24:14.993 --> 24:19.122
- Well, eventually, yes, but...
- Try and stay positive.

24:19.289 --> 24:22.250
How's Gall feeling?

24:22.417 --> 24:25.837
- He can move his toes.
- See? Things are looking up.

24:43.313 --> 24:47.567
<i>(radio) This is Major John Sheppard.
That's my ship you're messing with.</i>

24:47.734 --> 24:50.070
<i>I'd like it back.</i>

24:50.237 --> 24:53.490
- This ship is Lantian.
- Yes, it is.

24:53.657 --> 24:55.575
They were on the verge of defeat.

24:55.742 --> 24:58.453
You weren't around
for the end of the war. You lost.

24:58.620 --> 25:00.997
<i>- Impossible.
- It's true.</i>

25:01.164 --> 25:03.417
You're the last of your kind.

25:04.710 --> 25:08.338
Their city was under siege.
Atlantis was all that remained.

25:08.505 --> 25:10.757
Victory was inevitable.

25:10.924 --> 25:13.885
<i>Well, you can see for yourself
my ship is Lantian.</i>

25:14.052 --> 25:17.806
I'm living proof we're still around
but the Wraith are all gone.

25:17.973 --> 25:21.143
No one's left but you.

25:23.061 --> 25:25.939
What you say cannot be true.

25:26.106 --> 25:31.653
Come down to your own ship
and see for yourself. I'll be waiting for you.

27:30.147 --> 27:32.691
You cannot hope to defeat me!

27:47.581 --> 27:50.292
There. What'd I tell you, huh?

27:50.459 --> 27:53.086
Rodney, I don't feel so good.

27:56.882 --> 27:59.801
Water. Probably need some water.

28:02.304 --> 28:05.640
<i>- (Sheppard) McKay.
- Major, what's happening?</i>

28:05.807 --> 28:09.436
I thought you should know...
round one was a draw.

28:09.603 --> 28:12.939
<i>- I don't like the sound of that.
- I took some fire.</i>

28:13.106 --> 28:17.027
- Are you injured?
- That's what I mean by "I took some fire".

28:17.194 --> 28:20.238
But I don't think it's too bad,

28:20.405 --> 28:22.949
but my P-90's out of commission.

28:23.116 --> 28:26.036
He found a nine mil,
figured out how to use it.

28:26.203 --> 28:28.830
<i>- The Wraith will heal itself.
- No kidding.</i>

28:28.997 --> 28:32.042
<i>I put at least 20 shots into him.</i>

28:32.209 --> 28:36.963
I've seen Wraith go down and stay down
with far less. This guy's different.

28:37.130 --> 28:40.467
The Wraith's ability to heal itself
may be proportional

28:40.634 --> 28:45.639
to how recently the Wraith has fed,
and he's... fed pretty recently.

28:45.806 --> 28:48.225
There's gotta be more to it than that.

28:48.392 --> 28:52.437
<i>- Can Gall move his fingers yet?
- Barely.</i>

28:52.604 --> 28:55.232
- Stick a gun in his hand.
- Major?

28:55.399 --> 28:58.485
<i>Just in case I don't make it back.
Sheppard out.</i>

28:58.652 --> 29:02.489
That's comforting, huh? Right. Water.

29:21.758 --> 29:23.802
Oh, crap!

29:34.563 --> 29:37.566
<i>- What the hell was that?
- I almost blew myself up.</i>

29:37.733 --> 29:39.943
<i>- What?
- Stay off the radio. I'm busy.</i>

29:40.110 --> 29:43.864
Right. He's busy.

29:45.198 --> 29:49.202
- You wanna go and help him, don't you?
- Me go up against a Wraith?

29:49.369 --> 29:53.040
You do. I can tell. You've changed.

29:53.206 --> 29:55.459
- You wanna get out there.
- Shut up.

29:55.625 --> 30:00.005
Don't get me wrong. I'm impressed.
You want in the fight.

30:00.172 --> 30:03.842
- The Rodney McKay I knew would never...
- We're staying here.

30:12.267 --> 30:14.728
All right.

30:14.895 --> 30:18.065
Take this, but don't shoot at anything
until I tell you to.

30:18.231 --> 30:20.317
OK.

30:59.231 --> 31:01.316
<i>(buzzing)</i>

31:13.412 --> 31:15.497
D'you want some of this?

31:45.485 --> 31:47.946
OK, OK. That's enough.

32:54.930 --> 32:57.641
<i>(gunshots)</i>

33:12.072 --> 33:14.449
<i>(whooshing)</i>

33:55.449 --> 33:59.369
- You're right. I should go out there.
- I said you wanted to.

34:02.039 --> 34:05.500
- Because I should.
- No, you shouldn't.

34:05.667 --> 34:10.005
But don't let me stop you. If you think
you can help the major by going...

34:10.172 --> 34:13.759
- I can't leave you here.
- Yes, you can.

34:13.925 --> 34:17.429
What difference does it make?
We know I'm not gonna make it.

34:17.596 --> 34:21.391
Stop being so dramatic.
You're getting stronger by the minute.

34:21.558 --> 34:24.936
- I've never felt so weak.
- Then stop talking.

34:25.103 --> 34:27.731
I'm dying, Rodney. I can feel it.

34:27.898 --> 34:30.734
- Stop it!
- I'm getting worse.

34:31.902 --> 34:35.364
He left me with enough life
so you'd have to watch me die.

34:35.530 --> 34:41.495
All you need is a good meal,
a pot of tea and to stop talking and...

34:42.954 --> 34:45.248
Brendan!

34:46.166 --> 34:48.793
I'm sorry.

34:48.960 --> 34:52.672
- You said to stop talking.
- I'm sorry, I thought you'd...

34:52.839 --> 34:55.425
Apologies.

34:55.592 --> 34:57.677
Nice work.

35:22.244 --> 35:26.915
<i>- (buzzing)
- Not now, guys.</i>

35:45.475 --> 35:47.561
<i>(buzzing)</i>

35:55.986 --> 35:58.613
We may be able
to make radio contact now, sir.

35:58.780 --> 36:01.074
Major, this is Lieutenant Ford. Come in.

36:04.244 --> 36:08.540
Major, we should be there inside an hour.
Please respond.

36:08.707 --> 36:12.544
- Perhaps we are still too far away.
- Or they can't get a signal.

36:12.711 --> 36:15.505
See if you can make this thing go faster.

36:15.672 --> 36:19.176
Do you think I'm a fool, Major Sheppard?

36:19.342 --> 36:22.345
There's nowhere for you to go
on this world.

36:22.512 --> 36:26.892
When I feed upon you,
I will savour the taste of your defiance.

36:27.059 --> 36:29.061
Hey, you. Over here.

36:29.227 --> 36:32.147
<i>On the ground, the radio.</i>

36:35.067 --> 36:39.863
The days on this planet are long,
but the nights are cold.

36:40.030 --> 36:43.742
Sooner or later I will have you.

36:43.909 --> 36:47.079
I can't hear you threatening
to suck the life out of me

36:47.245 --> 36:49.498
till you hit the button on the radio.

37:24.700 --> 37:27.202
- You hear that?
- No.

37:27.369 --> 37:32.457
I thought I heard something.
Maybe there's another one hibernating.

37:32.624 --> 37:34.710
No.

37:34.876 --> 37:37.838
It's been too long.
The major could be in trouble,

37:38.004 --> 37:40.674
and if he's in trouble, we're in trouble.

37:40.841 --> 37:43.552
- Then go.
- Do you think you can move?

37:43.719 --> 37:47.514
Not a chance. I'm not going anywhere.

37:47.681 --> 37:51.059
OK. That's OK.

37:51.226 --> 37:54.604
Go. Rodney, just go.

37:56.481 --> 37:58.608
Save the day.

37:58.775 --> 38:03.155
I wanna call him on the radio,
but I might give away his position.

38:03.321 --> 38:06.783
What chance would we have
if Sheppard can't take him out?

38:06.950 --> 38:09.411
<i>- I was hoping you'd be strong...
- (gunshot)</i>

38:16.793 --> 38:18.879
Oh, no.

38:29.723 --> 38:31.808
You have got to be kidding me.

38:31.975 --> 38:36.438
I have fed upon countless thousands
of humans and Lantians,

38:36.605 --> 38:38.690
even upon my own crew,

38:38.857 --> 38:43.236
and I will feed upon you
before this day is done.

38:48.992 --> 38:52.788
<i>- Major, this is Lieutenant Ford.
- Lieutenant, I like your timing.</i>

38:52.954 --> 38:56.500
<i>- Get your ass down here.
- We're still two zero minutes away.</i>

38:56.666 --> 38:59.961
Your timing sucks.
Get here as soon as you can.

39:02.172 --> 39:07.344
You need me to get off this planet.
I'm the only one who can fly that ship.

39:08.804 --> 39:12.849
I will use your dead hands
to operate its controls.

39:13.016 --> 39:15.102
<i>(gun clicks)</i>

39:46.174 --> 39:49.010
- Major!
- McKay!

39:49.177 --> 39:53.140
- What do I do now?
- Keep firing everything you got!

39:58.520 --> 40:01.106
<i>- (gun clicks)
- OK, now what?</i>

40:01.273 --> 40:04.192
Reload!

40:10.532 --> 40:13.952
- We're picking up their life signs.
- Head straight for 'em.

40:14.119 --> 40:17.247
<i>(Ford) Sir, we're picking you up
on the HUD.</i>

40:27.466 --> 40:29.968
No more bullets!

40:52.199 --> 40:56.161
Ford, lock on to the biggest
life-sign signals you can see and fire.

40:56.328 --> 41:00.040
- Negative, sir. You're too close!
- That's an order. Do it!

41:01.041 --> 41:03.543
Fire on that target.

41:05.837 --> 41:07.547
McKay, run!

41:30.904 --> 41:33.115
McKay?

41:33.281 --> 41:34.950
Still here!

41:36.076 --> 41:38.912
<i>Sir, this is Ford. The target has gone.</i>

41:39.079 --> 41:41.540
Well, it's about damn time.

41:41.707 --> 41:43.959
We got here as soon as we could.

41:44.126 --> 41:46.586
That's not what I meant. Thanks.

41:46.753 --> 41:49.798
You're welcome, sir.
We'll be there in a few minutes.

41:49.965 --> 41:52.467
<i>We can wait.</i>

42:10.027 --> 42:14.156
- Thanks.
- Yeah. You too.

42:14.322 --> 42:18.243
- You OK?
- Other than this and a few cracked ribs.

42:23.915 --> 42:27.210
What about Gall?

42:27.377 --> 42:29.463
No.

42:42.976 --> 42:48.899
You'll have to put the ship back together,
provided you can disarm the shield.

42:49.066 --> 42:52.194
Fine. As long as we get to go home.

42:52.361 --> 42:55.280
<i>- (Sheppard) You can drive.
- Oh, thank you.</i>
