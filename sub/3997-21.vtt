Winston:
Watching TV-- cool.

00:09.053 --> 00:10.703
Cool.

00:12.533 --> 00:14.001
(Sighs)

00:15.291 --> 00:18.548
Nick: Where do you think you're going?
That charger belongs to all of us.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.702
- Nowhere.
- Jess: Oh, really?

00:19.714 --> 00:21.341
Because it looks
like you're going

00:21.359 --> 00:24.089
to your room to charge
when it's not your turn.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.702
You know the rules, dumb-dumb.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.968
Charger stays in a neutral room.

00:27.980 --> 00:29.234
Why do we only have
one charger anyway?

00:29.252 --> 00:31.170
It was supposed to bring us
closer together.

00:31.188 --> 00:32.122
Hey, look, another charger.

00:32.128 --> 00:34.476
- Take him! - Get him!
- Get down!

00:34.533 --> 00:36.971
You guys get him started,
I'll finish him off.

00:37.002 --> 00:37.793
(All yelling)

00:37.824 --> 00:41.012
- Just... so many dude butts.
- Watch my face, man. That's my face.

00:41.049 --> 00:42.671
Watch my face.
Hey, that's the moneymaker.

00:42.684 --> 00:45.036
No, I'm gonna stop him,
I'm gonna stop...

00:45.303 --> 00:47.609
- Get... No!
- You are terrible at this.

00:47.646 --> 00:49.814
Schmidt: Oh, you can't
outrun the Jewish.

00:51.883 --> 00:52.928
That was stupid.

00:52.934 --> 00:54.384
They are such idiots.

00:54.397 --> 00:55.722
I don't know why I do this.

00:55.741 --> 00:57.260
The charger doesn't
even fit on my phone.

00:57.278 --> 00:59.609
I have, like, six chargers
in my room.

00:59.737 --> 01:00.969
I just do this for fun.

01:00.987 --> 01:02.896
(Laughing):
It's funny.

01:06.301 --> 01:08.182
Well, here we are by ourselves.

01:08.233 --> 01:09.955
What should we do?

01:09.974 --> 01:12.393
- Uh, definitely not make out.
- Definitely not.

01:12.411 --> 01:14.543
(Both laughing)

01:22.855 --> 01:24.506
Your hand's on my boob.

01:24.579 --> 01:25.979
Yeah.

01:26.145 --> 01:27.758
And it's weird.

01:28.072 --> 01:29.763
Maybe it's less weird
because I know

01:29.780 --> 01:31.246
that it's weird--
I'm calling it out.

01:31.265 --> 01:32.763
Doesn't make it less weird.

01:32.775 --> 01:34.771
- Right on.
- So you're an upper-boob guy.

01:34.783 --> 01:36.657
That's the most underrated part
of the boob.

01:36.673 --> 01:37.840
It's what I've always said.

01:37.861 --> 01:39.413
Can I ask you a question?

01:39.418 --> 01:42.265
- Please.
- What's going on here?

01:42.289 --> 01:43.690
- Yeah.
- What are we...?

01:43.708 --> 01:45.262
- We, us?
- What are we doing? Yeah.

01:45.274 --> 01:46.800
We are roommates,

01:46.845 --> 01:48.373
who have made out
a couple of times,

01:48.398 --> 01:50.322
and are attracted to each other.
- Mm-hmm.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.032
- And really good friends.
- Yeah.

01:52.057 --> 01:54.929
And sometimes genuinely
kind of hate each other.

01:55.425 --> 01:57.016
And sometimes...

01:57.047 --> 01:59.435
touch each other's boobs.

02:04.633 --> 02:05.965
- Little bit better...
- Not helping.

02:05.984 --> 02:07.212
- Little bit worse?
- Yeah.

02:07.723 --> 02:09.139
♪ Who's that girl?

02:09.163 --> 02:11.594
♪ <i>Who's that girl?</i> ♪

Sync and corrections by Norther
www.addic7ed.com

02:16.544 --> 02:18.952
Would you describe this
as a sexual act?

02:18.977 --> 02:21.360
I would describe that
as the pledge of allegiance,

02:21.411 --> 02:23.015
which can be sexual. Why?

02:23.039 --> 02:25.320
Because this is what
I got from Nick.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.166
Just out of the blue.
No reason.

02:27.184 --> 02:28.786
Our relationship's
so confusing.

02:28.805 --> 02:30.633
But this is Nick
we're talking about.

02:30.652 --> 02:32.975
He's never gonna tell
me how he feels.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.368
It's always gonna be weird.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.600
And I have to stop
expecting for it to...

02:36.796 --> 02:37.635
change. What?

02:37.647 --> 02:39.444
You realize your hand
is still on your boob, right?

02:39.462 --> 02:41.420
I can't explain it, it's...

02:41.703 --> 02:43.741
it's, like, really
calming me down.

02:43.766 --> 02:47.197
I mean, the sexual tension
has been off the charts.

02:47.228 --> 02:48.923
It's like the wild west.

02:48.942 --> 02:50.731
No laws.

02:50.750 --> 02:52.117
Whiskey for a nickel.

02:52.152 --> 02:54.019
Whores caked in mud.

02:54.054 --> 02:55.721
I don't know what to do.

02:56.349 --> 02:58.619
You're always there
when I need you, Tran.

02:58.875 --> 03:00.417
Thank you.

03:00.611 --> 03:02.288
(Laughs)
I'm glad you got no life.

03:02.327 --> 03:03.619
(Laughing)

03:03.667 --> 03:06.323
I'm joking.
Would you settle down?

03:06.464 --> 03:08.302
My father just died.

03:08.468 --> 03:09.902
I don't know,
life's short, huh?

03:09.936 --> 03:11.761
It just kind of...

03:12.281 --> 03:14.060
I got to start
doing things, Tran.

03:14.085 --> 03:16.582
Making moves,
grown-up moves.

03:16.634 --> 03:19.053
I don't know, I want things.
I want to, like, mow a lawn,

03:19.077 --> 03:21.547
you know, my lawn,
in dark socks.

03:23.182 --> 03:25.001
What's my move with Jess?

03:25.199 --> 03:26.666
What would you do?

03:27.413 --> 03:30.793
Of course you would,
you dirty dog. (Laughs)

03:32.347 --> 03:34.381
Well, in reality, Tran,

03:34.495 --> 03:36.663
what would do if you were me?

03:38.859 --> 03:40.328
A date?

03:40.433 --> 03:42.468
What if that's not
what she wants?

03:42.713 --> 03:43.814
What if she... oh!

03:43.837 --> 03:45.351
What if she...? (Laughs)

03:45.635 --> 03:47.269
All right, you're right--
no second-guessing.

03:47.292 --> 03:49.193
I got to be confident,
I've got to be clear.

03:49.211 --> 03:50.731
Women like that.

03:50.757 --> 03:52.691
All right, I just got to say...

03:54.231 --> 03:55.725
Jessica,

03:55.925 --> 03:57.893
you are a beautiful woman,

03:58.109 --> 04:03.115
and my life has not been
the same since I met you.

04:03.412 --> 04:06.475
And it would mean the world
to me if you would, uh...

04:06.969 --> 04:08.770
go on a date with me.

04:13.562 --> 04:14.875
Hey, Nick.

04:15.738 --> 04:17.377
Jess...

04:17.908 --> 04:19.558
...ica.

04:19.774 --> 04:23.009
Dirty J, Dr. day,
my toilet sister.

04:23.027 --> 04:25.349
If so, food.

04:27.282 --> 04:28.614
You want to get food later?

04:33.383 --> 04:35.118
I'm gonna get dressed now.

04:36.670 --> 04:38.124
Okay, bye.

04:40.014 --> 04:42.776
- Did you put the charger the bathroom?
- The most neutral room in the loft.

04:42.806 --> 04:44.532
- Yeah, well, I moved it to the kitchen.
- The kitchen?

04:44.544 --> 04:46.310
- Hey, guys.
- Nick, what's more neutral?

04:46.364 --> 04:49.207
The awesome bathroom or
the stupid, stupid kitchen?

04:49.232 --> 04:51.591
I have a lot of thoughts
on this, but first, Schmidt,

04:51.609 --> 04:52.941
I have a favor.

04:53.003 --> 04:55.168
- It's about my clothes.
- Burn them, burn them all.

04:55.199 --> 04:57.547
No, no, no, no, no,
I have a date tonight,

04:57.572 --> 04:59.357
and, you know, there's a lot
of women who sleep with you,

04:59.376 --> 05:01.614
and I can't figure out why, so maybe
it's about clothes, and maybe...

05:01.638 --> 05:04.262
Are you asking me if I'll help
you pick out clothing

05:04.281 --> 05:06.231
so you can seduce a woman?
- I was.

05:06.249 --> 05:10.257
I don't know. It's only all I've been
wanting for the past ten years, Nick.

05:11.623 --> 05:14.592
Yes, that is how you wrap
a son of a bitch in wool.

05:14.645 --> 05:16.924
Now, if somebody asks you
who you're wearing tonight,

05:16.949 --> 05:18.662
what do you say? Do it, bro.
- I don't want to do that.

05:18.679 --> 05:20.448
- I don't want to do that.
- Do it.

05:22.269 --> 05:23.871
- I'm wearing Schmidt. Yeah.
- Yeah, you are.

05:23.896 --> 05:26.310
And neckscape by Winston.

05:26.335 --> 05:29.180
Oh... whoa, who is
that handsome devil?

05:29.204 --> 05:31.154
Okay, now, here's some things
you want to hide about yourself

05:31.166 --> 05:32.515
on tonight's date, okay?
- Definitely, yeah.

05:32.539 --> 05:33.970
That you're cheap,
you're a heavy drinker,

05:33.980 --> 05:35.747
you're broke and you have
a problem with anger.

05:35.765 --> 05:37.214
Your car is horrible.

05:37.233 --> 05:39.914
So go ahead and take
my new Foscapay.

05:41.184 --> 05:42.742
What's a Foscapay?

05:43.088 --> 05:43.998
Uh, Ford Escape.

05:44.016 --> 05:45.445
I'm still work-shopping
nicknames.

05:45.493 --> 05:46.998
- By the way, who's the girl?
- Who's the girl?

05:47.016 --> 05:48.397
- Who's the girl? Yeah.
- Uh, what's her name?

05:48.416 --> 05:50.035
It's, uh, yeah, it's, uh...

05:50.291 --> 05:52.925
Her name is, uh,
obviously Yolanda.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.105
Uh...
her last name is Winston.

05:58.551 --> 06:00.906
- I should go.
- Oh, I love latino girls.

06:01.408 --> 06:02.575
Yolanda Winston.

06:03.039 --> 06:04.185
Schmidt, that's a fake name.

06:04.191 --> 06:06.126
Yeah, but why would
he lie about...

06:06.147 --> 06:07.314
Oh, my God.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.722
- Nick is a male escort.
- Jess...

06:11.269 --> 06:13.033
- Probably not a... Yeah.
- Jess, man.

06:13.045 --> 06:16.376
Do you realize what it means
if Jess and Nick become a couple?

06:16.395 --> 06:18.065
Nick is our glue, man.
You know, without him,

06:18.090 --> 06:19.568
it just doesn't work--
it never has.

06:20.235 --> 06:22.211
See what I mean?
He's awesome, man.

06:22.230 --> 06:24.268
This is my,
one of my best friends, too.

06:24.303 --> 06:25.846
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

06:33.606 --> 06:35.200
(Weakly):
Nick...

06:37.212 --> 06:38.206
Nick...

06:38.392 --> 06:41.112
All of our stories start
and end with Nick.

06:41.161 --> 06:42.824
What if Nick decides
he's gonna leave us?

06:42.849 --> 06:44.424
Well, you know what
we have to do, right?

06:44.699 --> 06:45.703
We're gonna track Jess down

06:45.722 --> 06:47.834
and kill her with this knife.
- We have to sabotage the date.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.959
Or we do your thing.

06:52.214 --> 06:53.881
Let's do your thing.

06:57.681 --> 06:59.478
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey.

06:59.509 --> 07:01.498
What are you doing over
there by the hot dogs?

07:01.521 --> 07:04.184
You gave me the address, I just assumed
we were eating at the hot dog stand.

07:04.209 --> 07:05.783
- No...
- Why are you wearing a suit?

07:05.808 --> 07:07.521
Did you just apply
for a loan or something?

07:07.546 --> 07:09.460
No, I'm, uh...

07:12.229 --> 07:13.179
I'm wearing Schmidt.

07:13.197 --> 07:14.366
You're wear...
you're wearing what?

07:14.384 --> 07:15.713
I'm wearing Schmidt, uh...

07:15.725 --> 07:16.844
Winston shaved my face.

07:16.896 --> 07:18.301
(Laughs)

07:18.413 --> 07:19.089
Weird.

07:19.107 --> 07:20.970
Well, come on, let's
get some dinner.

07:21.090 --> 07:23.782
Come on, I got a reservation.
Come on. (Siren chirps)

07:24.957 --> 07:25.541
What?

07:25.559 --> 07:27.530
Hi, there, sir.
Afraid, uh,

07:27.571 --> 07:29.891
you apparently didn't see
the crosswalk was over there.

07:29.903 --> 07:32.633
Oh, let's not sweat the small stuff,
officer. I'm walking across the street.

07:32.639 --> 07:34.797
- Afraid I'm gonna have to write you
up for jaywalking. - Stay calm,

07:34.815 --> 07:36.222
make tiny fists with your toes.

07:36.259 --> 07:38.325
- I'm really sorry about this.
- Jess, I'm not upset.

07:38.356 --> 07:39.894
This man is merely doing his job.

07:39.925 --> 07:41.021
You were right, I was wrong.

07:41.038 --> 07:42.806
Here you go, sir.
Thank you, officer.

07:43.211 --> 07:44.883
$340?!

07:44.901 --> 07:47.846
Yeah, I know it's a lot.
They raised it last year, I think.

07:48.110 --> 07:48.979
Have a good night, ma'am.

07:49.006 --> 07:51.558
- All right, just scram. (Laughs)
- You too, sir.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.692
Dinner?

07:54.305 --> 07:56.016
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:57.241 --> 07:59.097
- After you.
- Thank you.

07:59.115 --> 08:00.482
Okay.

08:01.156 --> 08:02.625
Very lovely.

08:05.247 --> 08:06.681
What an establishment.

08:06.733 --> 08:08.306
It's my favorite in the city.

08:09.308 --> 08:10.541
Right on time.

08:10.628 --> 08:11.975
Oh...

08:12.021 --> 08:13.847
Keep it coming.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.435
Hey, Nick,
can I ask you a question?

08:17.475 --> 08:18.554
What's on your mind?

08:18.579 --> 08:20.035
Well, I'm just asking...

08:20.059 --> 08:21.789
if this is a date.

08:24.955 --> 08:28.843
- What do you mean, "is this a date?"
- I'm just... I'm asking you if this is a date.

08:29.288 --> 08:30.555
It seems like a date.

08:30.854 --> 08:33.140
You've been thinking it's
a date this whole time?

08:33.244 --> 08:34.995
- I'm just asking you.
- How embarrassing for you.

08:35.020 --> 08:36.871
No, for me, it's just
hanging out in a suit,

08:36.897 --> 08:38.710
getting champagne
with my friend.

08:39.948 --> 08:40.698
(Grunts)

08:40.722 --> 08:42.419
I think we're ready to order.

08:42.532 --> 08:44.222
I have an idea--
I'm gonna have the bartender

08:44.253 --> 08:46.053
send over two
tropical cocktails.

08:46.081 --> 08:47.852
Jess will be all,
"Why, thank you."

08:47.881 --> 08:50.126
Nick will be all, "Grandpa
didn't get a face full

08:50.150 --> 08:53.659
of Japanese bullets just so you
could drink a melted popsicle."

08:53.662 --> 08:54.312
Or...

08:54.324 --> 08:56.023
we could break into a zoo,

08:56.057 --> 08:57.799
steal a bear,

08:57.853 --> 09:01.220
then we shoot that bear full
of Hep C, and then we release

09:01.238 --> 09:03.857
that bear in the restaurant
right when they order dessert.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.627
- Winston, you're terrible at pranks.
- I get that.

09:05.674 --> 09:08.263
You don't think just a bear
alone in a restaurant is enough?

09:08.284 --> 09:10.414
- You know who would know what to do?
- I do know who would know what to do.

09:10.437 --> 09:11.764
- Nick.
- Nick.

09:13.456 --> 09:15.081
We can't call him, right?

09:15.192 --> 09:16.892
(Cell phone ringing)

09:19.920 --> 09:20.727
Ooh.

09:20.733 --> 09:23.346
They have, uh, Brussels sprouts
with pancetta.

09:23.390 --> 09:25.053
That's a fancy name for bacon.

09:25.441 --> 09:27.085
Hold the Brussels sprouts.
Am I right?

09:27.118 --> 09:29.843
Everybody loves
bacon, Jess-- New topic.

09:30.631 --> 09:32.206
You know, um...

09:32.463 --> 09:34.274
- If this were a date...
- Yeah, but it wasn't, Jess...

09:34.293 --> 09:36.481
- But, I mean, if it were...
- It wasn't a...

09:37.005 --> 09:39.670
And it's probably good
because your ex-boyfriend just

09:39.688 --> 09:41.270
walked into the restaurant.

09:41.297 --> 09:43.235
- Who?
- The only man we both loved.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.459
Russell.

09:44.484 --> 09:45.765
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:45.803 --> 09:48.524
Hi, so this is why
you dumped me, huh?

09:48.530 --> 09:49.787
- Oh, well...
- No...

09:49.806 --> 09:51.437
Just kidding.
I'm glad to see

09:51.455 --> 09:52.543
this is finally happening.

09:52.561 --> 09:54.007
- Nothing's happening, so...
- Nothing's happening

09:54.025 --> 09:55.842
because I was never told
it was happening,

09:55.879 --> 09:59.078
so if a happening happens and
you don't know that it happened,

09:59.103 --> 10:00.519
did it happen, you know?

10:00.656 --> 10:01.442
Russell:
Right on.

10:01.460 --> 10:04.018
Um, hey, enjoy my lucky table.

10:04.341 --> 10:05.784
I'm Brandy.

10:08.382 --> 10:09.919
Okay.

10:13.143 --> 10:14.612
You know what?

10:15.049 --> 10:17.739
Can we just forget
about this date,

10:17.884 --> 10:20.023
or not-date, and...

10:20.057 --> 10:21.571
Maybe start over

10:21.596 --> 10:23.519
and go get a drink
at the bar as friends?

10:23.549 --> 10:24.848
Drinking to forget?

10:24.866 --> 10:26.423
That's my sweet spot.

10:26.898 --> 10:28.573
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

10:28.746 --> 10:30.947
(Sighs) These clothes
are so uncomfortable.

10:31.420 --> 10:33.605
Glad to get it off.
In there.

10:34.048 --> 10:35.297
You ready to drink
with a friend?

10:35.316 --> 10:36.923
- I am, Jess.
- Yes.

10:36.942 --> 10:39.084
Let's do this.
(Siren chirps)

10:40.374 --> 10:42.713
Why isn't the crosswalk here?
Just let it out.

10:42.744 --> 10:45.382
- Just let it out.
- This is where people want to cross, sir.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.488
We don't need our table.

10:46.507 --> 10:48.554
We're sitting at the bar.
Not a date.

10:48.579 --> 10:51.107
Your table's all yours--
not on a date.

10:51.132 --> 10:52.331
Schmidt:
<i>I think we're doing too much</i>

10:52.349 --> 10:55.388
brainstorming and not enough
good old-fashioned remembering.

10:55.394 --> 10:58.025
What's the worst thing that you've
ever experienced on a date?

10:59.129 --> 11:02.824
♪ I will be your father figure

11:02.854 --> 11:06.092
♪ put your tiny hand in mine

11:06.115 --> 11:09.248
♪ I will be your
preacher teacher ♪

11:09.291 --> 11:12.278
♪ Anything you have in mind

11:12.309 --> 11:15.528
♪ I will be your father figure

11:15.549 --> 11:18.551
♪ I have had enough of crime

11:18.760 --> 11:22.362
♪ I will be the one
who loves you ♪

11:22.747 --> 11:26.089
♪ Till the end of time.

11:28.287 --> 11:30.330
Schmidt: Outside Dave,
my friend Winston here

11:30.349 --> 11:31.980
holds in his hands the lyrics

11:32.044 --> 11:34.208
to sir George Michael's
"Father Figure."

11:34.220 --> 11:36.076
- I'm familiar.
- What's it gonna take for you to lose

11:36.088 --> 11:37.731
the shirt and go ruin
a date for us?

11:37.737 --> 11:39.537
We're willing
to pay you handsomely.

11:39.709 --> 11:41.619
Four million U.S. dollars

11:41.631 --> 11:43.749
and a trip to wine country.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.722
(Chuckles)

11:47.939 --> 11:50.273
Schmidt (Whispering):
I don't have $4 million.

11:50.658 --> 11:51.689
All right, give him that.

11:51.742 --> 11:53.243
I'll tell you what.

11:53.533 --> 11:55.193
25 minutes of TV time

11:55.210 --> 11:57.620
and two home-cooked
sandwiches.

11:59.250 --> 12:02.126
One home-cooked sandwich.

12:03.788 --> 12:05.168
- Deal.
- Yeah, deal.

12:05.218 --> 12:06.393
Okay, Outside Dave.

12:06.425 --> 12:09.163
Make yourself at home here on the couch,
and I'll get started on those sandwiches...

12:09.181 --> 12:11.041
To the laboratory!

12:11.456 --> 12:13.363
Diversion!

12:13.730 --> 12:15.454
(Door slams shut)
Two urinals?

12:15.485 --> 12:16.702
I'm rich!

12:16.835 --> 12:18.216
(Nick and Jess laughing)

12:18.234 --> 12:19.668
You both have jobs.

12:19.678 --> 12:20.899
Get another charger.

12:20.917 --> 12:22.251
I love those guys,
but they're idiots.

12:22.276 --> 12:24.220
- They are idiots.
- They are so dumb.

12:24.245 --> 12:26.224
To their credit,
they don't go around

12:26.248 --> 12:28.404
randomly grabbing
each other's boobs.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.974
- That we know of.
- Randomly? Oh, no way.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.592
You put it out there, Jess.

12:32.610 --> 12:33.735
- What?
- Yes, you do.

12:33.741 --> 12:35.365
I do not put it out there.

12:35.384 --> 12:37.271
"Hey, Nick, will you help me
open this jar?"

12:37.296 --> 12:38.043
(Laughing):
What?

12:38.062 --> 12:39.218
- Yes.
- I can't open the jar.

12:39.245 --> 12:41.043
"How do you restart
the Internet?"

12:41.056 --> 12:42.816
That's just me suffering
through life.

12:42.828 --> 12:44.251
You have to stop,

12:44.263 --> 12:46.775
because it's ridiculously hot.

12:47.153 --> 12:48.691
Okay?

12:49.291 --> 12:51.797
It's... hard for me
to deal with,

12:51.802 --> 12:53.408
'cause it's too hot.

12:54.223 --> 12:55.058
All right, fine.

12:55.076 --> 12:57.686
Then you have to stop
gargling your beer.

12:57.909 --> 12:59.528
- That's a turn-on?
- It's hot.

12:59.584 --> 13:01.022
- (Gurgles)
- (Laughs)

13:01.049 --> 13:03.224
- That is so weird, that that's a turn-on.
- You're like...

13:03.242 --> 13:04.713
Might as well be in, like, a...

13:04.725 --> 13:06.631
like a hose, spraying you down.

13:06.645 --> 13:09.225
- You are out of your mind.
- (Gurgles)

13:09.371 --> 13:11.138
(Both laugh)

13:12.386 --> 13:13.620
Hey.

13:14.896 --> 13:17.203
Do you want to get some dinner?

13:20.131 --> 13:21.698
Like a...

13:22.088 --> 13:23.838
like a date?
(Laughs)

13:25.452 --> 13:27.820
- Yeah. Let's...
- Okay.

13:29.027 --> 13:30.861
- Yes! Let's do it!
- We're going on a date!

13:30.908 --> 13:31.975
- Yes!
- Yes!

13:32.353 --> 13:33.554
(Siren chirps)

13:34.539 --> 13:36.236
Come on, guys.

13:36.638 --> 13:39.082
Guys, so sorry. Curveball.

13:39.107 --> 13:40.438
We need the table back.

13:40.472 --> 13:42.065
We <i>are</i> on a date.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.998
- We are on a date.
- Amazing.

13:44.025 --> 13:46.922
Hey, Marc, could you clear the table
but leave the breadsticks?

13:47.174 --> 13:49.149
Actually, don't clear the table,
'cause that looks good.

13:49.208 --> 13:50.021
(Laughs)

13:50.040 --> 13:51.396
Could you clear the fish?

13:54.805 --> 13:56.740
I don't want to be
too forward, but...

13:56.774 --> 13:59.762
whatever baby wants, baby gets.

13:59.805 --> 14:00.738
Daddy's buying.

14:00.763 --> 14:02.235
Well, look,
you keep buying my drinks,

14:02.254 --> 14:04.180
I'll put out
no matter what you say.

14:04.204 --> 14:05.691
- Ooh.
- I guess the good ones

14:05.721 --> 14:07.752
<i>aren't</i> all married or gay.

14:07.939 --> 14:08.815
(Slurps)

14:08.852 --> 14:10.140
How many have we had?

14:10.165 --> 14:12.150
- (Laughs) Ooh!
- (Laughs)

14:13.504 --> 14:14.724
Hey, Russell!

14:14.785 --> 14:15.737
Nice to see you!

14:15.749 --> 14:17.459
Date's going really well.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.481
That's... that's great news.

14:19.512 --> 14:21.320
- Really, really nice to see you guys.
- Yeah.

14:21.338 --> 14:22.851
You two are...

14:23.495 --> 14:25.043
really something.

14:30.162 --> 14:32.238
"Really something."
What does that mean?

14:32.538 --> 14:34.398
- Hmm.
- You know, we're having a great date.

14:34.417 --> 14:35.660
- Right?
- Who cares what he thinks?

14:35.679 --> 14:37.333
- (Laughing): Who cares what he says?
- I don't... agree.

14:37.373 --> 14:38.673
(Laughs)

14:38.683 --> 14:42.927
(Chuckles)
(Slurping)

14:44.264 --> 14:45.870
- Hey! Hey, Russell!
- Hey!

14:45.889 --> 14:47.570
- Oh, God. Where's my car?
- Jess: Hey, you said we were

14:47.595 --> 14:49.638
- "really something..." and we want to know
what that means. - What does that mean?

14:49.658 --> 14:51.739
- Nick: Yeah.
- This may come as a shock,

14:51.762 --> 14:53.720
but I have no opinion
about you two.

14:53.744 --> 14:55.870
Did you valet?
God, that is classy.

14:55.882 --> 14:57.668
You know what?
You can't just tell

14:57.711 --> 15:00.082
two people that they're
"really something"

15:00.101 --> 15:01.470
and just walk away.

15:01.489 --> 15:03.110
Fine. You-you want
to know what I meant?

15:03.136 --> 15:05.398
- Yes! - You live together and
you had three dates tonight.

15:05.540 --> 15:06.953
What's that?

15:07.101 --> 15:10.627
I think you guys don't really know
what you are to each other. Right?

15:10.645 --> 15:13.009
- Well, you're wrong. No, you're wrong. Yeah.
- You are wrong, because we know what we are...

15:13.021 --> 15:14.583
We do know... yeah.
We know what we are.

15:14.606 --> 15:15.818
Okay, this'll be fun.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.107
Tell you what.
Why don't you write it down?

15:18.519 --> 15:19.738
Seriously.

15:19.790 --> 15:21.440
Write down what
you think this is.

15:21.458 --> 15:22.805
Is this a relationship,

15:22.824 --> 15:25.031
a one-night stand,
above the waist only?

15:25.180 --> 15:25.987
No wrong answers.

15:25.999 --> 15:27.576
- You had two pens on you this whole time?
- Well, sure.

15:27.598 --> 15:29.592
- That's the move right there.
- You better believe it.

15:29.684 --> 15:31.622
(Laughs)

15:35.842 --> 15:38.667
Outside Dave: This is so much
better than the gutter!

15:38.698 --> 15:41.304
I'm calling the Police, I'm calling
the D.A., I'm calling somebody.

15:41.323 --> 15:44.159
- Mmm, smells like ladies in here.
- Damn it. My battery's dead.

15:44.171 --> 15:47.228
Yeah, mine, too.
Where is the charger?

15:49.347 --> 15:51.856
Schmidt, you put the charger
back in the bathroom?

15:51.875 --> 15:54.128
I'm sorry, okay? I thought it
was the neutralest room.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.072
Outside Dave:
Three, two, one...

15:56.222 --> 15:57.789
(Grunting):
...zero!

15:57.904 --> 15:59.542
(Clears throat, sighs)

16:02.399 --> 16:03.906
- Let's just go, Brandy.
- Jess: Wait. No, no, no, no.

16:03.929 --> 16:06.560
- Don't go. Yeah, I got it, too. Me, too.
- I got this, I got this.

16:06.578 --> 16:07.348
There it is.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.121
Okay.
Figured it out.

16:09.848 --> 16:12.404
- Good. Great. - Great.
- Russell: Okay.

16:15.383 --> 16:17.585
Y-you know what?
This wasn't such a good idea.

16:17.603 --> 16:18.850
Maybe just forget
I thought of it.

16:18.875 --> 16:20.434
- We're just gonna go. All right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:20.471 --> 16:21.888
It's best that way.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.503
- What did you write?
- What did <i>you</i> write?

16:24.896 --> 16:26.571
- Russell, Russell, hey.
- Russell, we have to get

16:26.583 --> 16:28.152
to the bottom of this.
- Okay, move it, move it.

16:28.158 --> 16:29.783
Excuse me, sir.

16:30.359 --> 16:32.093
The crosswalk... geez.

16:32.221 --> 16:33.421
Sorry.

16:34.174 --> 16:36.141
Oh, my gosh.

16:38.807 --> 16:40.869
Outside Dave:
Hair sauce!

16:40.968 --> 16:43.557
- Hair sauce? Oh, my God.
- Mmm, feels like mud.

16:43.575 --> 16:45.967
If he even looks
at my pomade caddy,

16:45.986 --> 16:48.189
I will turn every hobo
in the city against him.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.797
I will poison every pie
on every windowsill.

16:50.816 --> 16:53.563
He doesn't steal pies
from windowsills.

16:53.594 --> 16:56.876
He is a real-life
homeless person.

16:56.903 --> 16:58.316
We need to call the cops.

16:58.335 --> 17:00.693
Oh, I'm sorry, we can't.
You know why?

17:00.722 --> 17:03.372
- Yeah, your phone's dead.
- Because of you, Schmidt.

17:03.409 --> 17:05.160
You want to know why I'd rather
hang out with Nick?

17:05.179 --> 17:06.632
- Shh. What is that?
- Outside Dave: Time to cut the grass.

17:06.637 --> 17:08.423
He's using my
four-in-one groomer.

17:08.446 --> 17:09.204
I'm going in there.

17:09.223 --> 17:10.781
- No! Schmidt! Absolutely not!
- I'm going in there, man.

17:10.806 --> 17:13.464
You hear that? Because that...
that is not the fourth use.

17:13.493 --> 17:15.657
- There's no sanctioned fifth use!
- Hey, Schmidt! Schmidt!

17:15.675 --> 17:17.494
- Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!
- He's using it for a fifth use!

17:17.520 --> 17:18.664
Nick is gonna be home soon.

17:18.683 --> 17:20.541
Okay? And then everything
will be fine.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.034
- Nick will know what to do.
- There's no time.

17:22.046 --> 17:23.565
- I'm going to the roof.
- What are you... Schmidt,

17:23.584 --> 17:25.997
why are you going up...
- Oh, my gosh, it's full of bugs.

17:27.358 --> 17:28.339
Nick,

17:28.352 --> 17:30.596
I need to know how you feel.

17:30.714 --> 17:32.051
What did you write
on that card?

17:32.070 --> 17:34.642
Well, what did you
write on your card?

17:35.155 --> 17:36.830
- Let's say it at the same time,
- Okay.

17:36.842 --> 17:38.645
on the count of three.

17:39.272 --> 17:41.640
One, two, three...

17:47.873 --> 17:48.873
Okay.

17:48.891 --> 17:50.121
From now on,

17:50.202 --> 17:51.865
no funny business.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.087
We do middle school
dance rules.

17:54.122 --> 17:56.757
Three feet on the floor,
no body hugs.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.734
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah.

17:58.770 --> 18:00.234
- You sure?
- Yeah.

18:02.976 --> 18:04.770
- Okay.
- Great.

18:05.866 --> 18:06.891
You got it.

18:06.915 --> 18:08.220
Wonderful.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.768
- Really?
- I...

18:16.461 --> 18:18.360
They've got a great
squish to 'em.

18:18.423 --> 18:20.873
- I couldn't stop thinking about it.
- Can't argue with you.

18:21.380 --> 18:23.203
Outside Dave:
Wow, you can see my skin.

18:23.222 --> 18:24.375
(Buzzing)

18:24.507 --> 18:26.141
Oh, good lord.

18:26.164 --> 18:28.058
Outside Dave:
Hot damn!

18:29.410 --> 18:30.197
(Sighs)

18:31.351 --> 18:32.166
You got this.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.015
You got this. Whoa.
(Screams)

18:34.526 --> 18:35.966
Schmidt:
What are you doing?

18:35.990 --> 18:37.840
- Outside Dave: Stop moving.
- Schmidt: Get off of me! (Screams)

18:37.871 --> 18:39.034
Hey, Schmidt!

18:39.252 --> 18:40.693
- He's got my leg!
- Winston: Outside Dave,

18:40.716 --> 18:41.863
man, what's happening in there?

18:41.881 --> 18:43.983
- Schmidt: What are you d... (Screams)
- Schmidt!

18:44.024 --> 18:45.603
Please! No!

18:45.665 --> 18:47.114
He's real homeless!

18:47.139 --> 18:48.018
(Screams)

18:48.043 --> 18:49.499
- No! Get off!
- Come on. Come on!

18:49.517 --> 18:51.492
If you're hurting him,
I swear... oh, my...

18:51.504 --> 18:52.703
Outside Dave:
It's shorts weather.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.875
Everybody's gonna
want to dance with you.

18:54.893 --> 18:56.861
Well, you're going against
the grain, you animal!

18:56.873 --> 18:58.277
Is he shaving your legs?

18:58.314 --> 19:00.369
Winston! Thank goodness!
Catch me.

19:00.394 --> 19:01.744
I got...

19:01.795 --> 19:04.226
I was about to catch you,
and then you just fell.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.027
(Sighs)

19:06.678 --> 19:07.711
You just saved my life.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.726
Anything, man,
as long as you're okay.

19:10.206 --> 19:11.019
You're okay?

19:11.037 --> 19:12.317
Well, I don't know.

19:12.450 --> 19:14.251
You break that whole thing down,
there was...

19:14.647 --> 19:16.558
A homeless man
was just shaving my leg.

19:16.583 --> 19:17.939
Yeah.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.269
Hey, man.

19:21.697 --> 19:23.331
Winston and Schmidt.

19:24.441 --> 19:25.323
Winston and Schmidt.

19:25.341 --> 19:26.572
- All right!
- Okay.

19:26.604 --> 19:27.704
- Yeah.
- All right, man.

19:27.722 --> 19:30.185
How long have the two of you
been the best of friends?

19:30.320 --> 19:31.895
Longer than we ever knew.

19:31.942 --> 19:34.634
I will say it's hard to have a moment
with you when there's a homeless dude

19:34.660 --> 19:36.406
dropping a deuce in our urinal.

19:39.477 --> 19:41.596
- We never actually ate, so...
- Yeah, I know.

19:41.608 --> 19:43.167
I'm getting a snack.
I'm going to bed.

19:43.185 --> 19:44.930
- Can I have some of these?
- Sure.

20:15.544 --> 20:16.463
Thank you.

20:16.508 --> 20:17.642
You're welcome.

I'm gonna go to bed now.

20:19.581 --> 20:20.848
Okay.

20:24.609 --> 20:26.435
Don't.
(Sighs)

20:29.397 --> 20:30.898
(Gargles)

20:32.363 --> 20:34.464
I have to go to sleep.

20:34.618 --> 20:36.018
I'll walk with you.

20:50.103 --> 20:51.904
(Whispering):
