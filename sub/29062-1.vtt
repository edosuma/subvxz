00:35.083 --> 00:36.789
Guys, I've had a great time.

00:36.875 --> 00:38.240
- Let's do it again.
- Yes.

00:38.375 --> 00:39.160
Bye.

00:39.375 --> 00:40.740
See you soon, take care.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.448
- Thanks.
- See you later...

00:42.667 --> 00:44.578
- Take care guys.
- Ciao.

00:44.667 --> 00:45.667
See you later.

00:46.792 --> 00:49.989
Damn, I can't believe
Raul and Sara are getting married.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.036
We introduced them!

00:56.042 --> 00:57.202
Hey, are you alright?

00:57.417 --> 00:58.247
Yes.

00:58.417 --> 00:59.156
Yes?

00:59.375 --> 01:00.080
Yes.

01:00.208 --> 01:01.789
Lost mylove

01:02.042 --> 01:04.498
you haven't been your usual self.

01:05.125 --> 01:06.706
We're close enough now,

01:06.833 --> 01:08.573
you can tell me what's wrong.

01:08.708 --> 01:10.494
Yes... I don't think...

01:10.583 --> 01:13.040
Whatever it is,
don't worry about it, ok?

01:13.125 --> 01:13.705
Ok.

01:13.833 --> 01:15.824
They're moving a piano
at this time.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.332
I don't know how to tell you this.

01:21.417 --> 01:22.417
What's up?

01:23.250 --> 01:24.581
Have you ever felt

01:24.625 --> 01:28.743
that you're with someone who you love
more as a friend than as a partner?

01:29.458 --> 01:30.698
Yes, I guess so.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.369
Someone you really care for

01:34.458 --> 01:37.120
and while you know
you don't have a future,

01:37.250 --> 01:40.242
the fear of hurting them
stops you from breaking up,

01:40.583 --> 01:43.040
which only makes things
more complicated.

01:43.208 --> 01:44.368
No, never.

01:45.875 --> 01:47.661
I'm sorry. It's over.

01:48.792 --> 01:51.033
We've been together ages, Olivia.

01:51.250 --> 01:53.241
That depends on when you count from.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.870
From the first time we said
"I love you" or...

02:05.250 --> 02:06.250
Antonio?

02:07.250 --> 02:08.660
We're going to New York!

02:09.583 --> 02:11.038
We're going to New York!

02:11.833 --> 02:14.575
Aren't you excited?
Yes, of course. New York!

02:15.500 --> 02:17.536
It's the first time I've done this.

02:17.875 --> 02:21.618
Buy a flight with someone
for six months time!

02:23.250 --> 02:24.615
If we buy them now,

02:24.708 --> 02:27.871
that means we're going
to be together another six months.

02:28.000 --> 02:28.614
Of course.

02:28.792 --> 02:31.579
Even if it's only
so we don't waste the flights.

02:40.208 --> 02:44.030
If you're going to leave me,
better do it now than in a month's time.

02:46.208 --> 02:49.041
I'm going to do it, I'm doing it.

02:51.708 --> 02:52.618
You're right.

02:52.708 --> 02:54.448
- What?
- It's a huge commitment.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.749
Who knows where we'll be
in six months.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.198
I think it's better to end it.

03:02.167 --> 03:03.373
Why isn't he responding?

03:03.625 --> 03:04.625
We sedated him.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.323
He was hit by a piano.

03:06.708 --> 03:09.825
His leg's broken.
He needs a full examination.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.995
I hope he remembers that we broke up.

03:14.083 --> 03:16.369
Shit, imagine I hadn't said it,

03:16.458 --> 03:18.039
and the piano paralysed him,

03:18.125 --> 03:19.740
I would never have left him.

03:19.833 --> 03:23.496
Shit, I can't believe my luck.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.990
I know it sounds horrible.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.243
But I can't help it.

03:30.333 --> 03:31.743
Too far? Do you have a sedative?

03:31.833 --> 03:35.655
It's a lot of mixed emotions,
breaking up with someone is horrible.

03:41.875 --> 03:44.708
- Get out.
- There's no need to be like that!

03:45.875 --> 03:48.412
Tell him I'll see him at the hospital.

04:00.708 --> 04:04.576
Hey, is there a discount for six?
Yes, discount.

04:04.667 --> 04:05.873
- Five Euros?
- Yes.

04:22.458 --> 04:23.458
Bastard.

04:28.375 --> 04:31.663
Is there any need to be like that?

05:30.625 --> 05:34.038
- Give it, give it to me!
- Bloody hell, take it!

05:52.625 --> 05:59.781
Graceful lady

05:59.875 --> 06:04.118
from malaga!

06:07.625 --> 06:15.625
I wish I could kiss your lips

06:18.625 --> 06:24.495
I wish I could kiss your lips
graceful lady from malaga

06:24.583 --> 06:26.574
do you believe in love at first sight?

06:29.583 --> 06:30.583
I do.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.161
Especially if the other person is fit.

06:34.875 --> 06:37.537
Not so long ago,
I fell in love at first sight.

06:37.958 --> 06:38.958
With Olivia.

06:39.083 --> 06:42.155
She saw some guys throwing a party
and what did she do?

06:42.250 --> 06:43.865
What anyone would have done:

06:44.042 --> 06:45.578
Sing them a song.

06:46.708 --> 06:48.198
Maybe it was the song,

06:48.792 --> 06:51.249
or how beautiful she looked
under the streetlight,

06:51.375 --> 06:53.536
while a drunk guy
threw up next to her,

06:54.042 --> 06:55.452
or because I was wasted,

06:56.500 --> 06:57.535
but I fell in love.

07:00.667 --> 07:03.249
I fell so deeply in love

07:03.458 --> 07:05.574
I had too much bike
and not enough brakes.

07:06.458 --> 07:10.576
Graceful lady from malaga!

07:14.458 --> 07:16.244
Are you ok?

07:20.583 --> 07:22.699
Do you want to go for dinner one day?

07:23.458 --> 07:24.458
What?

07:26.083 --> 07:28.995
If we ended up together,
we'd have an amazing story

07:29.083 --> 07:30.493
about how we met.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.581
Like notting hill on steroids.

07:33.750 --> 07:34.750
Wow...

07:45.583 --> 07:46.583
Was it good?

07:48.083 --> 07:49.869
The breakfast deal is until one.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.365
I'll have to charge full price.

07:51.458 --> 07:54.416
Augusto you bastard,
damn, it's only...

07:54.667 --> 07:56.203
Shit, half past four.

07:56.750 --> 07:59.412
Are you meeting
the girl you ran over today?

07:59.583 --> 08:01.869
Yeah, mate, I'm a nervous wreck.

08:02.167 --> 08:04.203
But, anyway, I hope it goes well.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.198
Of course it will.
Why wouldn't it?

08:06.250 --> 08:07.865
All your relationships go well.

08:08.583 --> 08:10.073
Like violeta, who you left

08:10.167 --> 08:12.579
because she was always
listening to Sam Smith.

08:12.667 --> 08:13.998
Ed Sheeran - Ed Sheeran.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.869
Or Alicia,
who you left for her sister.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.366
It'll be fine.
I've got a feeling.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.500
Yes, of course.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.119
Here. No need to thank me.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.785
That's not enough!

08:26.125 --> 08:28.411
That's why you don't need to thank me.

08:32.207 --> 08:33.789
So, you give monologues?

08:34.792 --> 08:37.408
The right term is stand up comedy.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.957
By the way,
I'm eating all of these.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.578
Don't you want any?
No, thanks, I'm allergic.

08:43.667 --> 08:46.124
My face balloons like a muppet's.

08:46.208 --> 08:48.164
I always carry adrenaline,
just in case.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.241
Really?
Cool, like in Pulp Fiction!

08:50.333 --> 08:51.994
See? Then you inject it.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.581
It's no joke. I could suffocate.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.448
In fact, if you don't mind.

08:57.083 --> 08:58.789
What were you saying
about monologues?

08:58.875 --> 09:00.160
Stand up comedy.

09:00.250 --> 09:02.332
Like why girls
go to the loo together

09:02.417 --> 09:04.829
and why napkins
don't absorb anything, right?

09:05.208 --> 09:06.698
I'm not a fan of monologues.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.707
If you don't like stand up,
you haven't seen real comedy.

09:09.792 --> 09:12.750
A guy on a stage,
opening up to his audience.

09:13.167 --> 09:16.489
Like that sensation
when more than 200 people

09:16.583 --> 09:18.995
laugh when you want them to laugh.

09:20.208 --> 09:21.243
Have you ever heen

09:21.333 --> 09:23.449
to a monologue that wasn't funny?

09:23.583 --> 09:24.413
I have.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.947
Alright, clever clogs, illuminate me,
what do you do?

09:28.208 --> 09:30.324
I'm in theatre.
I write and I act.

09:30.417 --> 09:32.533
- What bar do you work in?
- One in la latina.

09:33.042 --> 09:35.328
I'm particularly into
avant-garde theatre.

09:35.500 --> 09:39.118
The autobiographical movements,
artaud, theatre of cruelty.

09:39.208 --> 09:42.405
Sorry, I was about to fall asleep
out of pure boredom.

09:43.042 --> 09:44.657
Theatre of what? Of cruelty?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.615
What is the theatre of cruelty?

09:48.250 --> 09:52.163
The theatre of cruelty shocks
the viewer with a radical experience

09:52.250 --> 09:53.660
forcing him to pay attention

09:53.792 --> 09:55.077
and stirring his emotions.

09:55.458 --> 09:56.458
Fuck me.

09:56.542 --> 09:59.784
If I go to the theatre
to listen to someone's shit life story,

09:59.958 --> 10:01.414
I'd at least like a laugh.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.741
But life is drama, anguish, solitude.

10:03.875 --> 10:05.240
Life isn't funny.

10:05.625 --> 10:07.331
There you go. What a bitch.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.077
Leave it.

10:10.708 --> 10:11.948
Ah, of course.

10:12.125 --> 10:13.740
You're a man, so you pay?

10:14.667 --> 10:16.157
No way. We'll split it.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.244
Fine. That's great.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.870
Because, damn,
you drank a lot for a chick.

10:21.083 --> 10:23.165
Ah! Another micro-sexism!

10:23.375 --> 10:26.333
Sorry, you drank a lot for a mammal.

10:27.875 --> 10:30.992
What's more,
I don't agree that life is just drama.

10:31.792 --> 10:32.827
Shall I show you?

10:33.250 --> 10:34.250
What?

10:40.125 --> 10:41.125
Hey!

10:43.750 --> 10:44.990
The bill.

10:46.333 --> 10:47.493
Yes, what's wrong?

10:47.750 --> 10:48.990
You left without paying.

10:49.250 --> 10:51.332
Without paying?
You've got that wrong.

10:51.417 --> 10:52.452
That's not true.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.660
You're an idiot.

10:55.875 --> 10:57.740
I'm working, that's not funny.

10:57.833 --> 11:00.870
Sorry, he's a comedian,
he thinks he's really funny.

11:06.542 --> 11:09.079
- She didn't find that funny.
- No, not at all.

11:09.250 --> 11:10.250
Poor girl.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.249
Have you seen Annie hall?

11:19.458 --> 11:21.574
Yes. But it's a comedy.
Remember when...

11:22.583 --> 11:24.198
After the first date, he says

11:25.042 --> 11:26.498
it's best to kiss soon

11:26.583 --> 11:29.746
to avoid the awkward moment
of the first kiss?

11:30.333 --> 11:31.573
Yes, I remember.

11:38.208 --> 11:40.790
- We could go to see it one day?
- Yes, let's go.

11:40.875 --> 11:43.161
- Cool, good.
- Another day... yes, why not.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.160
Ok, cool.

11:44.250 --> 11:47.572
Well, I live up there.
Up there. I don't, I'm more...

11:47.625 --> 11:48.956
I live down there. 0k,

11:49.083 --> 11:50.243
- ciao.
- Bye.

11:52.250 --> 11:55.413
And we saw Annie hall
and bullets over Broadway

11:55.583 --> 11:57.574
and Manhattan murder mystery.

11:57.667 --> 11:59.623
We saw so many Woody Allen films

11:59.708 --> 12:01.994
that one day
I woke up with phimosis.

12:03.875 --> 12:05.581
But, even still,

12:05.833 --> 12:07.664
we've not had one bloody kiss.

12:08.792 --> 12:09.827
Right, you start.

12:16.792 --> 12:17.872
Water or vodka?

12:20.833 --> 12:21.538
Water!

12:21.583 --> 12:22.583
Vodkal

12:23.208 --> 12:24.208
your turn.

12:33.625 --> 12:34.239
Vodka?

12:34.625 --> 12:35.625
Yes.

12:37.042 --> 12:38.042
Your turn!

12:38.500 --> 12:40.582
We have a drinking game
in my village.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.373
Guess what it's called. "Drink".

12:42.667 --> 12:44.123
Shut up and drink.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.240
Vodka.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.786
It seems like they were all vodka!

13:06.417 --> 13:10.114
I think someone here
wanted to get someone drunk.

13:15.458 --> 13:19.121
Well, it must be really late, right?

13:22.417 --> 13:23.577
Right. Right.

13:30.667 --> 13:34.410
What was I going to say...
We'll see each other another day.

13:34.583 --> 13:37.120
- 0k.
- Yeah?

13:37.667 --> 13:42.331
We've still got two...
Two Woody Allen films to see.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.248
Yes, we've still got two.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.866
Do you remember where the door is?

13:47.125 --> 13:49.582
Yes, the way I came in.
It's the same, right?

13:51.208 --> 13:52.368
Ah, your phone.

13:53.667 --> 13:54.497
Alright, girl.

13:54.583 --> 13:55.583
Alright.

13:59.583 --> 14:01.164
Wait, wait.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.119
- Come on.
- Got it.

14:04.250 --> 14:05.250
Ciao.

14:06.542 --> 14:08.578
- Call me!
- Congratulations!

14:11.875 --> 14:14.116
Ah, oli... you're an idiot!

14:15.500 --> 14:20.324
Five dates, a bottle of vodka
and not one kiss!

14:21.750 --> 14:23.706
You're a complete fool.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.500
Come on, think.

14:39.125 --> 14:40.125
Hello?

14:40.500 --> 14:44.197
Olivia, I think I've left
my phone in your house.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.250
Bugger!

14:45.542 --> 14:48.705
Yeah, right,
because I'm going to need it for things.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.032
I can't see it here.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.500
What do I do?

14:56.833 --> 14:58.243
Do you want to come look?

14:59.458 --> 15:02.120
Ok, ok.
I'll be there in a minute.

15:02.250 --> 15:03.250
Ok.

16:06.708 --> 16:08.699
Fuck, man.

16:10.333 --> 16:11.333
What's up?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.615
You won't believe it, but...

16:14.750 --> 16:18.163
I'll have to grab a blablacar in a bit.
I've got a gig.

16:19.417 --> 16:21.248
I really can't be arsed.

16:24.542 --> 16:28.490
I'd stay here for another 17 years.

16:28.667 --> 16:29.667
Me too.

16:36.083 --> 16:37.083
Where's the gig?

16:37.875 --> 16:40.241
It's a drag. Valencia.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.581
I'm from valencia.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.123
I love valencia.

16:43.250 --> 16:46.367
There's no other city like valencia,
I love it, really.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.786
Maybe you'll think this is crazy, but

16:50.458 --> 16:51.458
why don't you come?

16:54.042 --> 16:55.953
I haven't seen my parents for ages.

16:56.042 --> 16:57.782
And I've never used blablacar.
No?

16:58.042 --> 17:00.249
Well, blablacar is awesome.

17:00.542 --> 17:01.782
The people are nice.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.992
I'll be there soon.
I'm in the car.

17:06.250 --> 17:09.242
No, no, pilu,
I'm not wearing my seat belt, pilu.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.036
That's for girls.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.327
Isn't it a bit gay?

17:13.250 --> 17:17.448
I can't wait to get there
and get on the mojitos!

17:17.541 --> 17:20.614
You have to meet luana,
my new Filipino maid.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.832
Blablacars are usually more fun.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.494
Her mojitos...
Of course, it's a Filipino drink...

17:26.083 --> 17:28.324
What do you mean they're from Cuba?

17:28.458 --> 17:30.414
Well maybe she's Cuban.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.458
What do I know.
They're all the same. Right?

17:40.333 --> 17:42.415
- What do you mean?
- See you.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.867
Mojito doesn't have gin in it?
It's rum? No way!

17:46.083 --> 17:49.746
- Fuck me, what a twat.
- No, don't say that, no way.

17:51.167 --> 17:53.579
I'm running late,
I'll go straight to the gig.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.741
I'll see my parents
and meet you there.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.035
Ok?
- 0k, ciao.

17:57.417 --> 17:59.578
But I won't laugh.
You're not very funny.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.453
Great. Thanks for that comment.

18:01.583 --> 18:02.583
By the way,

18:02.750 --> 18:04.411
don't bring your parents.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.572
Don't worry, they're more lbsen
and Chekhov than monologues.

18:07.625 --> 18:08.705
Stand up comedy.

18:14.792 --> 18:16.532
Hurry up, it's started.

18:18.167 --> 18:19.873
If you don't like it, pretend.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.207
Mario is sensitive
about his monologues.

18:22.250 --> 18:25.367
- Don't call them monologues.
- It's stand up comedy.

18:25.542 --> 18:29.660
The other day I read something...
It was already like that but I...

18:29.750 --> 18:31.081
Come on, over there.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.707
Did you know there is a
minimum legal age

18:33.833 --> 18:37.246
to have sexual relations with consent?

18:37.333 --> 18:40.245
Careful! That was "con-sent",
not "con-tempt".

18:40.333 --> 18:42.244
I don't give a damn
who you take to bed!

18:42.375 --> 18:44.707
But that got me thinking.

18:44.792 --> 18:46.828
So, is there a legal minimum age

18:46.958 --> 18:49.244
to have sexual relations
without consent?

18:49.375 --> 18:50.535
Careful, eh?

18:50.875 --> 18:53.116
Careful, we're in
murky waters here,

18:53.208 --> 18:55.119
swampy, full of crap... careful.

18:55.875 --> 18:57.615
I'm imagining two guys saying:

18:57.708 --> 18:59.244
"They've reduced the minimum age

18:59.333 --> 19:01.164
for sexual relations without consent?"

19:01.250 --> 19:02.250
"What, really?"

19:02.375 --> 19:05.242
"Yes, they've reduced it from 90 to 87".

19:05.333 --> 19:06.333
Then he says:

19:09.125 --> 19:11.457
"Blimey,
I'm going to shag my grandpa".

19:16.458 --> 19:19.700
Careful with the agua de valencia,
it's deceptive.

19:20.375 --> 19:21.706
Agua: Water,

19:21.833 --> 19:24.199
it's in the name: Water.
It's juice, vitamins.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.536
Drink up.
It goes down really easily.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.782
By the way, sorry if before,

19:29.875 --> 19:31.331
on stage,

19:32.125 --> 19:34.036
I said anything inappropriate...

19:34.250 --> 19:36.457
I didn't know Olivia was bringing you.

19:36.542 --> 19:39.614
Mario, Olivia's previous boyfriends
were a dj,

19:39.708 --> 19:43.121
an expert in car tuning
and someone called culebra.

19:43.208 --> 19:45.324
Cobra! His name was cobra, mum.

19:45.583 --> 19:47.744
Look, you can do
what you want up there.

19:47.833 --> 19:50.495
You could kill a polar bear on stage

19:50.625 --> 19:54.243
and I swear you'd still be
the best boyfriend Olivia's ever had.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.198
It's nice to know I've got such a...

19:56.333 --> 19:57.333
Wide margin.

19:57.375 --> 20:00.037
Shall I show you
my childhood bedroom?

20:00.125 --> 20:03.083
What? Perhaps it's not the time?

20:03.167 --> 20:05.078
It's as good as any other.

20:05.167 --> 20:06.452
Come on, hurry.

20:08.167 --> 20:09.532
- No, no.
- Yes.

20:11.458 --> 20:12.743
They can hear.

20:22.500 --> 20:26.163
No, you! I want to continue
being your best boyfriend!

20:26.583 --> 20:29.575
Don't worry!
You should have met culebra!

20:29.625 --> 20:31.161
You've still got a huge margin!

20:31.250 --> 20:33.787
- But, who is culebra?
- Cobra! Cobra!

20:39.042 --> 20:41.533
Listen oli,
I want to tell you something.

20:41.708 --> 20:42.447
What?

20:42.542 --> 20:44.328
This is a bit strange,

20:44.417 --> 20:46.874
but it's not the drink.
Did you hear that?

20:47.000 --> 20:51.573
- No. So, the last few days...
- Shh.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.494
A kitten.

21:00.667 --> 21:01.667
Look at that.

21:01.708 --> 21:05.656
Wit barstard drapped ye aff?

21:06.500 --> 21:07.865
Why are you talking like that?

21:08.167 --> 21:11.614
It's a Scottish cat.
He obviously miaows Scottish.

21:11.708 --> 21:12.823
Reit, Bonnie laddie?

21:13.417 --> 21:16.124
There's no excuse
for abandoning an animal.

21:16.458 --> 21:17.573
No matter how ugly.

21:17.875 --> 21:19.490
Don't say that to the cat.

21:19.583 --> 21:21.073
I'm not saying it to him.

21:21.250 --> 21:23.081
Plus, he doesn't understand me, right?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.410
What's up, little guy?

21:27.792 --> 21:29.328
Perhaps I should adopt him.

21:29.417 --> 21:31.373
No, no. I'm going to adopt him.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.790
- Why don't we both adopt him?
- Hello.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.240
Then we'd have to live together,

21:36.375 --> 21:39.037
I don't want him growing up
in a dysfunctional family.

21:44.542 --> 21:45.542
Better?

21:45.708 --> 21:47.244
What? Well...

21:48.375 --> 21:49.865
His name will be schrodinger.

21:50.000 --> 21:50.614
What?

21:50.708 --> 21:52.118
Schrédinger's cat

21:53.333 --> 21:56.245
schradinger did an experiment
to explain quantum physics.

21:56.417 --> 21:57.827
There's a cat in a box

21:57.958 --> 22:00.665
with a vial of poison,
and the vial could break or not.

22:00.750 --> 22:04.618
So, before you open the box,
the cat may be both alive and dead.

22:04.750 --> 22:07.537
That's why they called it
schrédinger's cat.

22:07.833 --> 22:10.165
How long ago was this experiment?

22:10.833 --> 22:12.164
I don't know. 80 years?

22:12.250 --> 22:15.083
Well, the answer is the cat is dead.

22:17.333 --> 22:19.870
He thinks he's funnay, but he's Bonnie.

22:20.042 --> 22:20.872
Yoo'll see,

22:21.042 --> 22:23.784
no, seriously,
don't give the cat a freaky name.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.740
They'll pick on him at school,

22:25.833 --> 22:27.664
steal his snacks at playtime...

22:27.750 --> 22:29.240
Do you have a better idea?

22:29.333 --> 22:30.869
Well, I was thinking...

22:36.958 --> 22:39.825
No, it's a horrible name.

22:40.083 --> 22:43.120
Yer nam is schrédinger,
isnae ret, Bonnie laddie?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.831
I've got a title for my play.

22:52.208 --> 22:53.072
What is it?

22:53.208 --> 22:55.620
A Saturday in July
in the back seat of a blue Volvo,

22:55.708 --> 22:59.030
how I lost my virginity with my cousin
and what I learnt that night.

22:59.583 --> 23:00.583
What's it about?

23:01.542 --> 23:04.033
You're so funny!
You should be a comedian.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.582
Listen, I've got a joke,
see if you laugh.

23:06.750 --> 23:07.580
Let's hear it.

23:07.750 --> 23:10.708
Do you know why
they call it the wonderbra?

23:10.875 --> 23:12.331
Because when you take it off,

23:12.500 --> 23:14.240
you wonder where her tits went!

23:15.208 --> 23:16.208
Very funny.

23:16.417 --> 23:18.658
And a perfect example of micro-sexism.

23:18.875 --> 23:19.875
Right.

23:32.542 --> 23:34.783
Someone's about to break
your favourite mug.

23:34.875 --> 23:38.242
- No, schrodinger.
- Schrédinger.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.032
- How do you say "no"?
- My love.

23:43.042 --> 23:44.042
What a guy!

23:44.625 --> 23:47.697
He responds to "my love".
Couldn't you just eat him?

23:48.250 --> 23:51.208
Mylove, can ye listen tae me.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.832
Please can ye push wi' yer paw

23:53.958 --> 23:56.574
Mario's mug oan th' fluir?

23:57.792 --> 23:58.998
What did you say?

24:01.250 --> 24:02.250
Ah!

24:03.333 --> 24:04.573
Thanks, my love.

24:04.625 --> 24:06.707
I didn't really like that mug.

24:09.542 --> 24:10.577
I'm going for a shower.

24:11.583 --> 24:12.583
Ok.

24:14.833 --> 24:16.664
Oli, have you seen my trousers?

24:16.750 --> 24:18.240
On top of your suitcase.

24:19.542 --> 24:20.542
Ah, ok.

24:23.542 --> 24:26.409
I'm going to have
to learn Scottish, eh?

24:26.875 --> 24:27.875
Ok.

24:28.625 --> 24:30.581
Don't worry if you hear shoots.

24:30.958 --> 24:32.494
Imagine it's a ceilidh.

24:32.958 --> 24:35.244
Three, two...

24:38.333 --> 24:39.333
Mario.

24:46.167 --> 24:48.078
I found this plastic spider.

24:48.250 --> 24:51.572
Do you know anything about it?
Maybe it's mylove's.

24:51.708 --> 24:54.370
Did you think
I'd be scared of a plastic spider?

24:54.458 --> 24:57.074
Because girls
are scared of spiders, right?

24:57.208 --> 24:59.574
Honestly, you've opened my eyes.

24:59.792 --> 25:01.328
The things I learn from you.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.203
I'm off, I've got that casting.

25:03.250 --> 25:04.535
How do I look?

25:05.875 --> 25:06.955
Fabulous.

25:07.167 --> 25:08.167
Great.

25:20.167 --> 25:21.532
Son of a bitch!

25:23.583 --> 25:25.119
There's hundreds of them.

25:25.208 --> 25:27.620
I hope you appreciate it,
it cost me a fortune.

25:27.708 --> 25:28.948
Wish me luck.

25:29.042 --> 25:30.122
Good luck!

25:30.208 --> 25:33.826
Working on the tele is selling yourself!
You bastard, I love you.

25:34.875 --> 25:38.163
I love you too, nutcase.

25:46.833 --> 25:54.833
Graceful lady from malaga

25:55.167 --> 26:01.037
I wish I could kiss your lips

26:01.542 --> 26:04.500
I wish I could kiss your lips

26:04.667 --> 26:07.704
graceful lady from mala...

26:19.417 --> 26:22.989
We use people as if they're
the latest model of mobile phone.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.619
"I'm replacing you with a newer model".

26:26.125 --> 26:29.197
And you can't get angry,
we both knew it would happen.

26:29.583 --> 26:31.869
It's the programmed obsolescence
of love.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.115
Is there any other choice?

26:35.583 --> 26:38.780
We don't look for a partner,
we look for a trophy.

26:39.417 --> 26:41.373
Physical, economic, intellectual...

26:43.375 --> 26:45.331
We want to be a Bob Dylan song

26:45.542 --> 26:47.658
but we write poetry like a kid.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.323
We want to go to the Taj Mahal

26:51.750 --> 26:53.581
on our minimum wage salary.

26:56.250 --> 26:58.115
All love stories

26:59.667 --> 27:01.453
are ghost stories.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.073
You didn't like it, right?

27:14.208 --> 27:17.041
The short time I managed
to keep my eyes open, yes.

27:17.208 --> 27:19.324
The two main characters were naked.

27:19.417 --> 27:22.614
I don't know how they managed
to make that so boring.

27:22.708 --> 27:23.823
It's not sexual.

27:23.958 --> 27:26.199
They're naked
so you focus on the person.

27:26.250 --> 27:30.118
Of course. Well, her, yes,
she was very good.

27:30.208 --> 27:31.243
She was great. Oli!

27:31.458 --> 27:32.743
Eva!

27:33.875 --> 27:34.875
Thanks for coming.

27:35.125 --> 27:35.989
I loved it!

27:36.125 --> 27:37.125
- Really?
- Really.

27:37.208 --> 27:38.948
- It was a gamble...
- It's amazing.

27:39.042 --> 27:40.248
Yes? Thanks.

27:40.375 --> 27:42.206
- This is Mario, my boyfriend.
- Hi!

27:42.250 --> 27:43.581
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

27:43.750 --> 27:45.615
I didn't recognise you
with clothes on.

27:47.250 --> 27:49.741
And the fact that you were both naked,

27:49.833 --> 27:53.405
there were no sexual connotations
or anything, not at all.

27:53.875 --> 27:56.708
I thought the plot
was really courageous.

27:56.792 --> 27:58.157
And the poster is cool.

27:58.250 --> 28:01.572
If you've got any left,
perhaps I could have one...

28:01.667 --> 28:03.623
Stop me before I say anything else.

28:03.708 --> 28:05.494
I'll let you know if there's any left.

28:05.583 --> 28:08.780
- 0k, cool, right? The poster.
- Hey, Matt.

28:09.042 --> 28:10.782
Hi, Olivia. Thanks for coming.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.615
It was beautiful.

28:14.833 --> 28:16.164
- Thanks.
- Honestly.

28:17.958 --> 28:19.698
This is Mario, my boyfriend.

28:20.083 --> 28:22.244
- Hi, what's up?
- Hi, a pleasure, Mario.

28:22.333 --> 28:23.823
I really liked the piece.

28:24.083 --> 28:28.247
I mean, the play, the Taj Mahal.
Really cool, I really enjoyed it.

28:32.542 --> 28:33.622
He's very funny.

28:36.333 --> 28:39.370
Every love story is a ghost story.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.539
That has stayed with me, Matt.

28:41.583 --> 28:45.451
The story came to me while in India,
contemplating the Taj Mahal.

28:45.542 --> 28:46.873
I'd love to see it.

28:47.125 --> 28:48.240
You don't need to go.

28:48.375 --> 28:51.538
There are loads of videos
and documentaries on the net,

28:51.583 --> 28:53.665
on YouTube:
"The Taj Mahal and love",

28:53.833 --> 28:57.325
"ghosts of the Taj Mahal",
there must be hundreds of them.

28:57.417 --> 28:58.873
It just takes one click.

28:59.417 --> 29:02.659
Well you should go.
Change your perspective of things.

29:02.875 --> 29:06.197
Mario doesn't like travelling.
He prefers the telly.

29:06.417 --> 29:09.079
I don't understand why
we admire buildings.

29:09.250 --> 29:12.492
The Taj Mahal.
I don't see the romance in it.

29:12.667 --> 29:15.739
The emperor shah
had it built for one of his wives

29:15.875 --> 29:18.708
and when it was done,
he removed the architects' eyes

29:18.792 --> 29:20.703
so they'd never build anything again.

29:20.792 --> 29:23.704
Super romantic.
I just want to drop my knickers.

29:23.792 --> 29:25.328
- I had no idea.
- Well yes.

29:25.417 --> 29:27.032
It's one of his monologues.

29:28.042 --> 29:30.499
I was going to marry a friend
for citizenship.

29:31.042 --> 29:33.408
For our honeymoon,
we wanted to help

29:33.500 --> 29:35.206
children with leprosy in India.

29:36.958 --> 29:41.031
My friend died,
but I decided to go on the trip.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.741
That's where I wrote the play,
in homage to her.

29:47.417 --> 29:49.032
You should have said that first.

29:52.583 --> 29:53.583
No!

29:59.667 --> 30:01.203
Bloody black humour.

30:03.542 --> 30:04.748
Well... well...

30:06.125 --> 30:07.456
Speak soon, ok? 0k,

30:08.583 --> 30:10.369
- well...
- Nice to meet you.

30:10.458 --> 30:11.458
Congratulations.

30:11.583 --> 30:13.574
- Liked it a lot.
- Thank you.

30:13.625 --> 30:14.705
Thanks for coming.

30:14.875 --> 30:17.082
- Thank you.
- Let's all meet up one day.

30:17.250 --> 30:18.740
- Ok, ciao.
- Bye.

30:18.958 --> 30:19.958
Hey, Matt.

30:20.167 --> 30:22.249
It's been a pleasure.
Likewise. Ciao.

30:22.417 --> 30:23.623
- Bye.
- Ciao.

30:27.167 --> 30:30.830
So, if I had an affair,
you would want me to tell you?

30:31.417 --> 30:32.532
Yes, of course.

30:33.333 --> 30:34.789
But I'll tell you now,

30:34.875 --> 30:38.242
if you have an affair,
I don't want you to tell me. Understood?

30:38.458 --> 30:39.458
Understood.

30:39.833 --> 30:40.833
Understood?

30:41.250 --> 30:42.706
Yes, I won't tell you.

30:42.792 --> 30:46.205
- No, bad, Olivia, bad!
- Bad, what? That's what you want.

30:46.333 --> 30:48.449
That's what I said,
not what I want.

30:48.542 --> 30:50.328
If I know you won't tell me,

30:50.417 --> 30:52.578
how will I relax in this relationship?

30:52.625 --> 30:55.037
You could have a lover
and I wouldn't know.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.991
What I wanted was for you to say

30:58.083 --> 30:59.368
that you would tell me,

30:59.458 --> 31:01.870
but that you know
you shouldn't tell me.

31:02.500 --> 31:05.242
That's the only way I'll know
that if you say nothing

31:05.333 --> 31:06.613
it's because nothing's happened.

31:06.667 --> 31:08.703
But, if something happened
and you didn't say,

31:08.792 --> 31:10.828
I would think that nothing had happened.

31:11.958 --> 31:15.155
Do you realise how
convoluted that sounds?

31:15.333 --> 31:17.870
Well, yes.
It's a little convoluted,

31:18.125 --> 31:19.990
but it's compelling logic.

31:21.500 --> 31:24.367
That evil looking roller coaster
is convoluted.

31:24.458 --> 31:27.074
There's no way in hell I'd get on that.

31:27.250 --> 31:31.243
No, no, no. Mario!

31:37.708 --> 31:39.073
It's coming!

32:03.958 --> 32:06.995
I want it to end!
I want it to be over!

32:20.333 --> 32:22.949
I want to break up! What?

32:29.250 --> 32:31.161
I think we should leave it.

32:32.333 --> 32:34.824
- What?
- I want us to break up.

32:41.583 --> 32:44.416
I'm just no good
for long term relationships.

32:46.083 --> 32:48.995
Sorry, I've tried,
but I can't, I can't do it.

32:49.833 --> 32:52.575
I feel the need to meet other girls,

32:54.000 --> 32:55.991
but I can't, you're stopping me.

32:58.750 --> 33:03.244
Just the thought that we'll spend
the rest of our lives together,

33:04.875 --> 33:06.365
stops me from breathing.

33:07.250 --> 33:10.822
I'm asking myself is this it?
Have we reached our limit?

33:12.583 --> 33:15.746
For the first few months,
just seeing you was like a drug.

33:17.500 --> 33:18.865
This is terrible, but...

33:19.875 --> 33:22.708
If I want to feel
like how I felt in the beginning,

33:22.792 --> 33:24.578
I need to meet new people.

33:26.250 --> 33:27.865
I'm not prepared for this.

33:32.792 --> 33:33.792
You fell for it?

33:37.042 --> 33:40.455
Ladies and gentlemen,
and the Oscar goes to...!

33:43.167 --> 33:45.874
Thank you very much,
my beloved audience,

33:46.167 --> 33:48.704
for supporting me,
you've always been there,

33:48.958 --> 33:50.573
honestly, it's been pleasure.

33:51.250 --> 33:52.706
Do you find this funny, scumbag?

33:52.792 --> 33:55.864
Very. But don't get too close,
I peed myself before...

33:57.667 --> 33:59.658
Can we go around again? Please.

34:07.583 --> 34:08.743
How do I look?

34:11.333 --> 34:13.995
Wow, girl. You look amazing.

34:15.000 --> 34:15.784
Are you going out?

34:15.875 --> 34:16.875
Didn't I tell you?

34:17.000 --> 34:18.864
I'm replacing Eva in Matt's play.

34:20.250 --> 34:21.831
No, you didn't tell me.

34:22.083 --> 34:24.244
But, that's cool, right?

34:24.458 --> 34:28.121
Fantastic, get up there on stage
for two hours naked.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.706
I don't know why
you're so dressed up,

34:30.792 --> 34:33.408
when you get there
you have to take it all off.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.706
Why don't you come to see me?
I'm scared.

34:35.833 --> 34:38.620
You'll be a success. You'll see.

34:38.958 --> 34:41.495
Especially with the guys
and the lesbians.

34:42.083 --> 34:43.744
Plus, I can't, I've got a gig.

34:43.833 --> 34:45.697
Start late.
You could see the first act.

34:45.792 --> 34:48.123
Yeah, right,
and watch you naked on stage

34:48.250 --> 34:50.241
with the most attractive guy ever

34:50.458 --> 34:53.996
in front of hundreds of people. Right.
Don't be silly.

34:54.833 --> 34:57.245
At most, tens of people.

34:58.792 --> 35:00.578
You're so funny.

35:00.667 --> 35:02.123
Are you a comic now?

35:05.500 --> 35:07.161
Fuck me, I'm really nervous.

35:07.333 --> 35:08.493
Don't worry.

35:10.833 --> 35:14.576
Just think that you're naked
and they're dressed.

35:15.125 --> 35:16.786
That's exactly what's wrong.

35:17.042 --> 35:20.000
Yes, I meant to say the opposite.
Come here.

35:21.167 --> 35:25.740
Guys, there were ten reservations
but there's only one spectator.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.206
Shall we cancel?

35:27.792 --> 35:28.792
Only one?

35:29.958 --> 35:30.958
Let me see.

35:37.000 --> 35:37.864
He's not here.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.036
Of course, he's left too.

35:41.250 --> 35:42.250
Let's cancel.

35:46.542 --> 35:48.658
I've had break ups of all types.

35:48.750 --> 35:50.957
I remember when I was with rocio,

35:51.042 --> 35:52.042
I had to leave her

35:52.125 --> 35:55.572
because she called me by my name
when we were making love.

35:55.958 --> 35:56.572
She'd say:

35:56.667 --> 35:59.659
"Sorry, I called you Mario,
forgive me", crying.

35:59.792 --> 36:01.328
"But my name is Mario!".

36:02.583 --> 36:05.416
She says: "I was referring
to another Mario".

36:06.625 --> 36:10.243
But now I'm in love and it's amazing.

36:12.083 --> 36:13.994
But it's also a pain in the ass!

36:14.458 --> 36:16.790
Because in the end,
everything goes wrong.

36:16.875 --> 36:19.867
Couples are always destined to break up.

36:20.125 --> 36:21.581
I don't know, for example,

36:22.000 --> 36:23.661
- are you two a couple?
- Yes.

36:23.750 --> 36:25.991
Yes? Well, you'll break up, sorry.

36:26.208 --> 36:29.245
Do you want to do it here,
so we can all have a laugh? No?

36:29.625 --> 36:32.412
Sorry if I'm a bit pessimistic,
but it's like that.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.786
I think the only way
a couple can end well

36:34.958 --> 36:36.789
is if one of them dies in time.

36:38.417 --> 36:41.250
Just think:
Romeo and Juliet, Titanic...

36:41.417 --> 36:43.157
They both fitted on that board,

36:43.250 --> 36:46.162
but Leonardo DiCaprio
wanted to leave it on a high.

36:46.250 --> 36:47.786
He didn't want, 20 years later,

36:47.958 --> 36:50.415
to get it in the neck
about the toilet seat.

37:45.875 --> 37:47.160
What are you doing there?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.456
I was thinking that...

37:53.833 --> 37:56.825
As we're getting on so well
and we're in a good place,

37:58.083 --> 38:01.655
wouldn't it be great to leave it now,
and take the happy memories.

38:02.333 --> 38:03.573
What are you saying?

38:06.875 --> 38:10.038
I was watching your monologue,
but I left.

38:10.667 --> 38:13.033
I didn't like the bit
about couples ending badly.

38:13.833 --> 38:17.496
But I said that because
it was a great lead into my joke, but...

38:17.583 --> 38:18.868
You seemed genuine.

38:19.375 --> 38:20.660
Perhaps you're right.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.823
I think you're a great guy,

38:23.083 --> 38:24.789
I'd like to stay friends, but...

38:24.875 --> 38:27.241
What will I think
of you in six months?

38:27.375 --> 38:28.375
Or you of me.

38:28.583 --> 38:29.993
Maybe not six, maybe two.

38:30.083 --> 38:33.246
I'm sure you'll start to see
faults in me that you didn't see before.

38:36.417 --> 38:39.033
Wouldn't it be better
to avoid all that suffering?

38:39.708 --> 38:41.699
No. No, it wouldn't be better.

38:42.083 --> 38:44.244
I'd rather go through that suffering.

38:48.167 --> 38:49.247
You fell for it!

38:49.750 --> 38:51.160
Ah, fuck me.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.332
Bloody hell, find your own jokes!

38:57.333 --> 38:59.995
I don't know what I'd do if you left me.

39:00.083 --> 39:02.074
I'd go help kids with leprosy.

39:02.167 --> 39:03.623
Become some kind of cliché.

39:03.708 --> 39:04.993
I'm not leaving you.

39:05.167 --> 39:07.579
And you can't leave me,
so there's no problem.

39:10.125 --> 39:11.956
Why can't I leave you?

39:12.167 --> 39:15.239
That's simple,
you couldn't live without mylove.

39:15.458 --> 39:17.540
He could live with both of us.

39:17.583 --> 39:19.574
A couple of months with you
and a couple with me.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.498
No, mylove stays with me.

39:21.583 --> 39:24.040
Let's stop talking about
who would keep mylove,

39:24.125 --> 39:25.990
we could break up over this nonsense.

39:26.167 --> 39:28.249
But I found him.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.616
You could visit him
whenever you wanted.

39:30.833 --> 39:34.246
You know there are lawyers
that specialise in custody of pets.

39:34.458 --> 39:36.665
Yeah, but you won't call one,

39:36.750 --> 39:38.240
that would be ridiculous.

39:38.333 --> 39:42.246
No, no. Well, unless you
forced me into it, of course.

39:44.458 --> 39:48.121
- But we're not going to break up.
- No, we won't break up.

39:48.542 --> 39:51.409
Of course not.
But if we did break up...

39:51.583 --> 39:53.164
- We're not going to.
- No.

39:54.167 --> 39:55.452
But he'd stay with me.

40:04.083 --> 40:06.119
For the well being of the cat,

40:06.208 --> 40:09.245
my client suggests he spends
a season with each of his guardians.

40:10.250 --> 40:12.241
Are you really doing this to me?

40:21.333 --> 40:23.540
My client requests custody in the summer

40:23.583 --> 40:26.575
because you get naked in the heat

40:26.708 --> 40:29.575
and the tattoo on your left buttock
scares the cat.

40:38.083 --> 40:39.664
I've split up with my girl.

40:39.833 --> 40:42.620
It's very complicated
because we have a cat.

40:43.083 --> 40:44.744
We have shared custody.

40:45.417 --> 40:48.864
But it's just not the same anymore,
now it gets it's claws out,

40:49.042 --> 40:51.408
it hisses at me, it doesn't eat...

40:51.750 --> 40:53.615
But it's normal, she's my ex.

40:55.417 --> 40:57.658
But with the cat, great.
We get on well.

40:57.750 --> 41:00.708
The problem is
she used to talk to him in Scottish,

41:00.792 --> 41:02.532
I don't understand a thing.

41:02.667 --> 41:05.079
When I see the pair of them talking,

41:05.208 --> 41:08.200
I ask the cat what they're saying
and he looks at me like:

41:08.333 --> 41:11.530
"Our stuff".
Dornt listen, it's nae worth it.

41:11.583 --> 41:14.996
He doesn't like me being nosy
because curiosity killed the cat.

41:15.083 --> 41:16.083
- Hello.
- Mario, no!

41:16.167 --> 41:17.532
I'm here for mylove.

41:17.875 --> 41:20.742
You can't come in without knocking.
Give me the keys.

41:21.750 --> 41:24.822
I think someone is having
a hard time getting over someone.

41:27.792 --> 41:30.329
I've come for mylove.
This isn't your house.

41:30.458 --> 41:31.458
Fine, ok,

41:31.542 --> 41:32.542
understood.

41:33.167 --> 41:34.167
Where is he?

41:36.375 --> 41:38.081
- Mylove.
- Mylove?

41:38.750 --> 41:40.411
Mylove, whaur ur ye?

41:42.167 --> 41:43.167
Mylove...

41:44.042 --> 41:45.042
What's going on?

41:45.375 --> 41:46.375
Mylove!

41:47.375 --> 41:49.707
- Whaur ur ye, mylove?
- Whaur are you?

41:49.833 --> 41:50.833
Whaur ur ye?

41:51.208 --> 41:52.243
Whaur are you?

41:54.333 --> 41:55.368
Whaur are you?

41:56.042 --> 42:00.536
Lost my love
responds to Scottish

42:11.958 --> 42:14.449
It's ridiculous, Olivia.
"Lost mylove".

42:14.708 --> 42:17.825
You could have put something else.
He only responds to "mylove".

42:18.083 --> 42:22.372
But you could have put "missing cat"
or "lost cat" and the name underneath.

42:22.458 --> 42:25.996
It's like the joke about
the dog called titswobble.

42:26.083 --> 42:27.869
"Officer, have you seen mylove?"

42:29.167 --> 42:31.579
Do you talk about our break up
in your monologue?

42:33.583 --> 42:34.583
Yes, a hit.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.456
You're on the telly a lot.

42:40.083 --> 42:43.871
Stand up involves talking
about your life, and yes, I mention...

42:44.000 --> 42:45.786
- Things about us.
- Yeah.

42:46.542 --> 42:49.454
But everyone has their own
version of events.

42:51.500 --> 42:52.500
I suppose so.

43:02.417 --> 43:03.417
"Lost mylove".

43:03.750 --> 43:04.750
Are you ok?

43:05.167 --> 43:06.657
I really miss mylove.

43:07.542 --> 43:09.578
- Your girlfriend or the cat?
- Yes.

43:12.708 --> 43:14.039
- Hello?
- Hello.

43:14.458 --> 43:16.323
I'm calling about the lost cat.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.242
Yes, but it's a real cat
that's called mylove.

43:20.417 --> 43:22.157
It's not a marketing campaign.

43:22.250 --> 43:23.535
No, we've found him.

43:23.708 --> 43:26.620
We're sure it's the one in the photo.
Really?

43:27.250 --> 43:28.660
- Are you sure?
- Yes,

43:29.000 --> 43:30.331
ok, I'll come over.

43:30.583 --> 43:32.574
They've got him. Yes! Go!

43:33.083 --> 43:37.122
This is Olivia. Don't leave a message,
I won't listen to it.

43:52.167 --> 43:53.202
Mylove!

43:56.792 --> 43:59.033
Where were you, rascal?

43:59.583 --> 44:02.040
You've already spent 6 lives,
don't risk it.

44:05.500 --> 44:07.661
Thanks a lot for calling. Really.

44:08.583 --> 44:10.369
- What are your names?
- Mabel.

44:10.667 --> 44:11.326
Marian.

44:11.625 --> 44:12.625
Mabel and Marian.

44:13.375 --> 44:14.375
I'm Mario.

44:14.875 --> 44:15.875
So...

44:17.583 --> 44:18.789
He's super cute.

44:19.708 --> 44:21.699
We were hoping you wouldn't answer.

44:22.125 --> 44:22.739
Right.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.365
So, I was thinking...

44:24.500 --> 44:26.081
Do you have some kind of...

44:26.458 --> 44:28.119
Ring or...

44:28.542 --> 44:31.124
Something original,
that's not like a ring.

44:31.208 --> 44:32.208
For your girlfriend?

44:35.667 --> 44:38.500
Siri, how do you say
"bloody cat" in a Scottish accent?

44:40.708 --> 44:41.708
Bludy moggie.

44:41.792 --> 44:43.407
That's right, bludy moggie.

44:43.542 --> 44:44.827
You're a bludy moggie.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Hello?

45:10.208 --> 45:10.788
Hello.

45:11.208 --> 45:15.497
- Why don't you call first?
- I was calling but you didn't answer.

45:15.583 --> 45:19.030
- It's not a good time. We'll talk later.
- No, it's important.

45:19.208 --> 45:20.869
We need to buy shampoo.

45:25.958 --> 45:27.038
Hey Mario.

45:27.250 --> 45:28.250
What's up, Matt?

45:31.750 --> 45:32.455
And...

45:32.583 --> 45:33.868
What are you doing here?

45:37.708 --> 45:39.414
Have you still not told him?

45:40.833 --> 45:42.869
Sorry you have to
find out like this...

45:43.833 --> 45:46.199
Olivia and I are going to get married.

45:50.708 --> 45:51.708
What's he saying?

45:52.583 --> 45:54.414
We're getting married for citizenship.

45:55.542 --> 45:58.830
- Why "citizenship" in quotations?
- I meant "married".

46:00.000 --> 46:02.366
And you didn't think to tell me?

46:03.417 --> 46:06.033
It's hard to find
the right time to say it.

46:06.125 --> 46:07.490
Yes, it's true.

46:07.792 --> 46:11.660
It happens to me. I had surgery,
I used to be a woman. Very tall.

46:11.750 --> 46:13.615
I never found
he right time to tell you.

46:13.708 --> 46:15.244
I'll leave you alone.

46:15.417 --> 46:16.417
Mario,

46:16.500 --> 46:20.573
they ask so many questions to ensure
it's not a marriage of convenience.

46:21.083 --> 46:22.243
So you're telling me

46:22.542 --> 46:25.579
that immigration is forcing you
to fuck each other.

46:25.667 --> 46:27.453
Matt and I live together.

46:27.708 --> 46:30.324
We may have had a thing or two,
but as friends.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.740
The typical fuckmate/hushand?

46:32.875 --> 46:36.072
Why are we talking about this.
Why are you here? Leave.

46:36.167 --> 46:38.579
I don't know why he needs citizenship.

46:38.708 --> 46:39.743
I'm from Argentina.

46:40.500 --> 46:41.500
No way.

46:42.083 --> 46:43.869
Since when are Argentinians...

46:44.042 --> 46:45.623
Now you're racist too?

46:45.750 --> 46:46.990
Leave, please.

46:47.125 --> 46:50.242
I came to talk about the cat.
Do you remember our cat?

46:50.375 --> 46:51.581
You don't have an accent.

46:51.625 --> 46:54.492
- Shall I put one on?
- What's wrong with mylove?

46:54.667 --> 46:55.782
He's been found.

46:56.083 --> 46:59.450
- Why didn't you say?
- I got sidetracked by your wedding news.

46:59.542 --> 47:00.247
Where is he?

47:00.375 --> 47:02.832
- Mario, where is mylove?
- Dead, ok?

47:03.417 --> 47:04.577
The cat is dead.

47:10.167 --> 47:11.167
I'm sorry.

47:11.667 --> 47:13.032
It's better if I leave.

47:17.792 --> 47:18.792
Come here.

47:48.750 --> 47:50.240
What the hell have I done?

47:50.500 --> 47:51.990
Wit th' heel hae ah dain?

47:57.500 --> 47:58.535
Alright, I see.

48:00.875 --> 48:01.955
Your nationality?

48:02.250 --> 48:03.250
Spanish.

48:03.375 --> 48:05.240
- And your partner?
- Argentina.

48:06.333 --> 48:08.494
What is your partner's star sign?

48:08.708 --> 48:09.708
Really?

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Yes.

48:12.042 --> 48:13.042
Pisces.

48:13.125 --> 48:14.125
Taurus.

48:14.250 --> 48:15.581
Imagine her temperament.

48:16.708 --> 48:19.780
What are the names
of the parents of your future spouse?

48:20.542 --> 48:22.203
I call them "mum and dad".

48:26.708 --> 48:28.699
William... William and Marina.

48:31.583 --> 48:33.574
What side of the bed does he sleep on?

48:33.667 --> 48:34.998
Is that really a question?

48:35.417 --> 48:36.577
Please, answer.

48:36.958 --> 48:37.958
On the left.

48:38.208 --> 48:40.665
Although the other day,
he fell asleep on top.

48:54.708 --> 48:58.951
When you finish a relationship
and you're a real man

48:59.042 --> 49:01.374
you want your partner to be ok,

49:01.583 --> 49:04.575
that she's alright,
but not amazing.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.742
Should she find love? Yes.
You want her to find love,

49:08.833 --> 49:12.325
but with an average guy,
an insurance salesman,

49:12.417 --> 49:15.409
with a bit of a belly,
side parting, called Tony.

49:15.500 --> 49:18.697
At best, he's a stamp collector.
That's all.

49:20.958 --> 49:23.370
We all want a Tony for our exes.

49:23.708 --> 49:25.573
But that doesn't always happen.

49:29.542 --> 49:33.410
My ex had the great idea of
getting together with

49:33.500 --> 49:35.456
a black, Argentinian engineer.

49:36.958 --> 49:38.744
You're thinking the same as me.

49:39.042 --> 49:40.623
A black Argentinian?

49:41.500 --> 49:43.616
I didn't know they existed.
How exotic.

49:43.708 --> 49:46.324
You should see him. He's 6 foot 2,

49:46.875 --> 49:48.831
flawless skin, by the way,

49:49.208 --> 49:50.698
and he works for a charity.

49:51.708 --> 49:56.327
He could sing you a tango, brew you
a mate, or help children with leprosy.

49:56.542 --> 49:58.157
I want to fuck him too.

49:58.458 --> 50:01.325
- What are you doing?
- Can you use headphones?

50:01.500 --> 50:02.865
I'm using headphones, smart ass.

50:04.125 --> 50:06.457
They work better if
you connect them, smart ass.

50:12.583 --> 50:15.199
A Saturday in July
in the back seat of a blue Volvo

50:15.250 --> 50:18.492
how I lost my virginity with my cousin
and what I learnt that night

50:19.708 --> 50:22.074
we've got Mario laguna here with us.

50:22.208 --> 50:24.449
Your film is off the charts.

50:24.583 --> 50:26.119
You play a guy

50:26.208 --> 50:28.574
who loses his memory
before his wedding.

50:28.625 --> 50:31.332
Well, basically,
he receives a blow to the head

50:31.875 --> 50:32.875
and...

50:34.208 --> 50:35.618
And well, in my case...

50:35.708 --> 50:39.530
As much as I've tried,
and as many blows as I've given myself,

50:39.625 --> 50:42.082
there's someone I just can't forget.

50:44.542 --> 50:47.124
Let's continue with the programme,
the opening of the play:

50:47.333 --> 50:49.324
“You're quite funny for a woman”.

50:49.417 --> 50:51.624
It's not irony,
it's the title of a monologue.

50:51.708 --> 50:54.575
Tonight in the luchana theatre
at quarter past ten.

51:01.417 --> 51:03.999
You didn't imagine
your first time like that.

51:05.083 --> 51:06.323
I really didn't,

51:07.083 --> 51:08.448
but I've learnt something.

51:11.667 --> 51:12.952
What have you learnt?

51:13.583 --> 51:15.574
That Volvo seats

51:16.208 --> 51:17.243
are very uncomfortable.

51:18.083 --> 51:19.789
I also learnt something.

51:20.625 --> 51:23.116
Virginity is like a bubble,
one prick and it's gone.

51:23.583 --> 51:27.030
- What? That wasn't in the script.
- They've finally laughed.

51:43.500 --> 51:44.500
Hae ye seen?

51:44.750 --> 51:46.160
See hoo Bonnie Olivia is.

51:50.167 --> 51:52.078
Wit ur you doing, scoundrel?

51:52.167 --> 51:54.328
You liked her photo.

51:54.667 --> 51:56.658
Why do you do these things, scoundrel?

51:57.250 --> 51:58.660
Because...

51:58.875 --> 52:00.786
You're a scoundrel.
Is that how I say it?

52:00.875 --> 52:02.536
Or do I have to buy a dictionary?

52:18.583 --> 52:20.699
It's really uncomfortable
to read it like this.

52:20.792 --> 52:22.703
I want to see your reactions.

52:22.792 --> 52:25.829
Or you could tell me you like it,
even if it was shit.

52:26.125 --> 52:27.160
Ah, alright.

52:27.583 --> 52:29.119
Thankfully, I've finished

52:29.250 --> 52:30.250
and?

52:31.833 --> 52:32.993
I like it.

52:33.250 --> 52:33.830
Yes.

52:34.250 --> 52:35.865
The characters...

52:36.250 --> 52:38.582
They're both idiots,
in a good way, I mean.

52:38.667 --> 52:40.874
They could be any one of us.

52:41.583 --> 52:43.824
They're nice but very childish,

52:43.958 --> 52:46.995
you can't get angry with them
even though you hate them.

52:47.250 --> 52:49.707
It could be called
"story of two idiots".

52:50.125 --> 52:52.411
I told you it's autobiographical, right?

52:53.000 --> 52:54.365
Yes? No...

52:55.042 --> 52:57.704
It's sad they don't work it out,
and that the cat dies.

52:57.792 --> 52:59.999
That's life.
We can discuss the end.

53:00.125 --> 53:02.036
The important thing is it's great,

53:02.125 --> 53:03.786
and I can't wait to direct it.

53:04.250 --> 53:06.081
The actors are going to love it.

53:06.250 --> 53:08.491
You could win an Oscar with these roles.

53:08.583 --> 53:10.494
Like Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump.

53:10.958 --> 53:13.700
You should be nicer to me,
I could spit in your beer.

53:14.833 --> 53:16.118
You wouldn't do that.

53:18.125 --> 53:20.161
You're going to scatter the ashes

53:20.250 --> 53:22.707
that they gave you
in the pet crematorium.

53:22.833 --> 53:25.040
You're in the countryside.

53:25.250 --> 53:27.411
It's romantic and sad at the same time.

53:27.500 --> 53:29.161
- That has to show.
- Yes.

53:29.375 --> 53:31.707
- Beautiful.
- Right...

53:37.125 --> 53:38.956
"Do you think this is a good place

53:39.042 --> 53:42.034
to throw mylove's ashes into the wind?"

53:42.792 --> 53:45.249
"Why is there a fag end
in mylove's ashes?"

53:46.333 --> 53:48.699
"Perhaps... he was a secret smoker".

53:52.125 --> 53:53.490
Just a minute, Raul.

53:57.167 --> 53:58.167
I'll kill him!

53:59.625 --> 54:01.832
He's a like a kick in the stomach.

54:02.458 --> 54:04.119
Perhaps he could be the cat.

54:05.625 --> 54:07.365
We need to find someone else.

54:08.042 --> 54:09.623
Ok. Just one thing...

54:12.417 --> 54:13.953
I'm going for a cigarette.

54:14.250 --> 54:16.332
Ok? Raul, start warming up.

54:16.708 --> 54:17.823
Warm up, yes.

54:20.458 --> 54:22.414
"Perhaps he was a secret smoker".

54:23.167 --> 54:25.078
It's was the fag end, right?

54:25.250 --> 54:26.615
Ok, ok, ok.

54:37.083 --> 54:39.074
Blinking heck!

54:45.583 --> 54:47.949
"Double delicacies, with ocean fish

54:48.083 --> 54:49.994
in a sauce with spinach".

54:50.583 --> 54:51.789
Shit, man,

54:52.167 --> 54:53.703
your cat eats better than me.

54:54.375 --> 54:55.375
It's not my cat

54:55.625 --> 54:56.956
and yes, indeed,

54:57.333 --> 54:58.698
it eats better than me.

54:59.542 --> 55:01.248
I tried one of these cans

55:01.333 --> 55:02.823
and I started to purr.

55:03.208 --> 55:05.824
I'll swap it for a cigarette.
No, this is free.

55:07.458 --> 55:08.948
I'm Dani, nice to meet you.

55:09.375 --> 55:11.616
- I'm a talent agent.
- Ernesto,

55:11.875 --> 55:13.786
I started directing a play today.

55:14.667 --> 55:16.578
Who is the caviar for?

55:17.583 --> 55:19.414
Mario laguna, he lives nearby.

55:19.875 --> 55:21.615
Mario laguna lives here?

55:21.875 --> 55:25.367
Give him the script
and convince him to play the lead role.

55:25.458 --> 55:28.655
He's perfect, famous,
charismatic, he speaks well...

55:29.708 --> 55:31.244
Mmm yummy.

55:32.417 --> 55:35.329
The guy who wrote wedding salad
has given us a script.

55:35.583 --> 55:37.619
- Alright.
- I laughed a lot.

55:37.792 --> 55:40.955
It's not your usual mind swap story.

55:41.250 --> 55:43.832
You have a hamster called socks.

55:44.083 --> 55:46.244
- Socks?
- Yes, the hamster.

55:46.458 --> 55:49.416
You're fed up with work,
with your girlfriend...

55:49.542 --> 55:53.831
And you're jealous of socks,
always so chilled on his wheel.

55:54.083 --> 55:57.405
And on one stormy night,
you look at him and say:

55:57.708 --> 55:59.994
"I wish I could swap with you".

56:00.708 --> 56:01.708
What happens?

56:01.875 --> 56:03.706
You swap minds!

56:03.833 --> 56:06.370
Wow! I didn't see that coming!
Well, well...

56:06.625 --> 56:08.035
What a script!

56:09.250 --> 56:10.956
It's a challenge,

56:11.333 --> 56:13.824
you'd have to do the hamster voice,

56:14.208 --> 56:17.120
act like a human,
but with the mind of a hamster.

56:17.792 --> 56:20.329
I know lots of people like that.

56:21.542 --> 56:22.542
And this script?

56:22.583 --> 56:25.950
It's not a script, it's a play.
I met the director.

56:26.042 --> 56:28.533
They're rehearsing here,
in that fleapit.

56:28.875 --> 56:30.035
When I told him

56:30.250 --> 56:33.663
you live here,
he started seeing dollar signs.

56:33.958 --> 56:34.958
Yeah, I bet...

56:35.583 --> 56:38.700
Actually, I wouldn't mind
doing some theatre.

56:39.333 --> 56:39.947
Theatre?

56:40.167 --> 56:42.328
Have you ever seen a play in your life?

56:42.417 --> 56:44.123
I've seen loads of plays.

56:44.458 --> 56:48.076
In fact, I'm a fan of antonin artaud
and the theatre of cruelty.

56:48.375 --> 56:51.447
Antonin artaud?
You just made that name up.

56:55.458 --> 56:56.573
My lost love?

56:58.625 --> 57:00.161
"I don't like travelling".

57:00.625 --> 57:02.490
"Do you know the taj matal..." No,

57:02.792 --> 57:03.792
"the.. M

57:04.000 --> 57:05.706
"do you know the takh..."

57:06.042 --> 57:07.373
"The tal..."

57:07.667 --> 57:08.827
"The tal mahalk?

57:09.167 --> 57:10.828
People think it's romantic,

57:11.583 --> 57:12.242
but...

57:12.375 --> 57:13.410
It was a gift...

57:13.583 --> 57:14.948
From... from tan shan...

57:15.083 --> 57:16.243
The emperor shan..."

57:16.542 --> 57:18.032
No, " shan... shan...

57:18.208 --> 57:19.539
Jahan... jahan shaja...

57:19.708 --> 57:21.573
For his emperor..."
No, his wife.

57:21.667 --> 57:24.033
The other one.
"His favourite wife..."

57:24.125 --> 57:25.490
"The Taj Mahal

57:25.667 --> 57:28.249
was a gift
from the great emperor shah jahan

57:28.417 --> 57:30.123
to his favourite wife."

57:30.500 --> 57:31.990
Do we have an aide?

57:32.375 --> 57:35.117
People say "how romantic".
But I don't see it.

57:35.208 --> 57:36.789
When, to build this palace,

57:36.958 --> 57:40.030
they had to kill 20,000 slaves,
and the architects

57:40.208 --> 57:41.448
had their eyes removed.

57:41.583 --> 57:44.780
That makes him the lowest
of ass kissers in history.

57:46.125 --> 57:47.240
What are you doing here?

57:47.792 --> 57:49.874
You know I'm a fan of the theatre.

57:50.542 --> 57:52.453
Can we talk for a minute?

57:52.667 --> 57:55.579
I moan?
You're the one allergic to the life.

57:55.792 --> 57:57.703
- Do you know what else?
- What?

57:58.417 --> 58:01.250
- I'm a drunk? You're the drunk!
- Can we smoke here?

58:01.458 --> 58:03.995
Olivia doesn't let us.
Better that than a twat!

58:04.208 --> 58:06.324
You've written a play about us

58:06.417 --> 58:09.705
and you don't tell me.
You talk us in your comedy monologues.

58:09.792 --> 58:11.999
Why did you put "monologues"
in quotations?

58:12.083 --> 58:14.324
I made a mistake!
I meant "comedy"!

58:14.458 --> 58:17.700
Look, this is bullshit,
it's a delusion, ok?

58:19.500 --> 58:21.331
You're ripping it up. Very good.

58:24.625 --> 58:27.207
I didn't know the play was about Mario.

58:27.250 --> 58:29.832
It's destiny,
he has to play the lead role.

58:30.583 --> 58:32.073
He won't play that role.

58:32.250 --> 58:36.619
- You can only do it if I play the lead.
- Now you think you're an actor?

58:36.708 --> 58:40.576
Of course, I'm a professional actor.
I live from my work.

58:40.958 --> 58:44.576
In the same way we can say
that you're a professional waitress.

58:49.625 --> 58:51.161
- Are you the director?
- Yes.

58:51.250 --> 58:53.616
When is rehearsal?
I'll be half an hour early.

58:53.708 --> 58:56.120
At nine.
I'll be half an hour late.

58:58.625 --> 59:01.367
He's not going to be in my play.
Put out the fag!

59:02.208 --> 59:03.208
It's our story.

59:03.333 --> 59:06.575
It's like the dialogues
have been transcribed.

59:06.792 --> 59:08.578
And it makes me look an idiot.

59:09.250 --> 59:10.865
How did she manage that?

59:11.667 --> 59:14.204
I don't understand
who would be interested.

59:14.333 --> 59:15.038
Well,

59:15.208 --> 59:18.371
you talk about it in your monologues.
It's not the same.

59:18.500 --> 59:19.956
No? It's not the same.

59:26.625 --> 59:28.240
Are you Mario laguna? What?

59:28.625 --> 59:30.240
Can we have a photo with you?

59:30.583 --> 59:31.583
- Of course.
- Yes.

59:31.667 --> 59:33.953
Come on... Mario laguna.
The legend.

59:35.583 --> 59:37.244
It's to screw over my boyfriend.

59:38.125 --> 59:39.865
- Another.
- We're going to a party.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.115
Do you want to come?

59:41.500 --> 59:44.412
Well, it's just,
we're up early tomorrow.

59:45.583 --> 59:48.325
We wanted an early night.
Well...

59:48.625 --> 59:51.207
Hang on... not early, early.

59:52.042 --> 59:53.407
He's not even an actor!

59:53.583 --> 59:56.416
He's a professional actor.
We're waiters.

59:56.542 --> 59:57.952
Stop saying that!

59:58.042 --> 01:00:01.239
Listen, if Mario is in it,
we could do it here.

01:00:04.208 --> 01:00:05.208
Here?

01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:13.622
- Fuck, Mario, wake up!
- Who are you? What day is it? What time?

01:00:13.708 --> 01:00:16.700
You're supposed to be
a serious actor today, remember?

01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:20.572
Your first rehearsal
started half an hour ago.

01:00:20.833 --> 01:00:22.824
Give me five minutes, please.

01:00:23.542 --> 01:00:24.998
Danny, it's Mario,

01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:26.458
listen,

01:00:26.875 --> 01:00:29.036
I may not want to get up tomorrow

01:00:29.333 --> 01:00:31.665
so do whatever you need to wake me up.

01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:36.121
With the power
that semi-sober Mario granted me...

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:39.366
- Watch out!
- Fuck, keep it down!

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.832
Fuck! Not like that!
Not like that!

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.500
Mario,

01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:44.583
not like that.

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:45.708
Not like that.

01:00:49.125 --> 01:00:51.241
- Are you sure you're ok?
- Yes.

01:00:51.375 --> 01:00:53.161
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks. Perfect.

01:00:53.667 --> 01:00:55.999
Ok, let's start! Go to page 15.

01:00:56.542 --> 01:00:58.533
The first day
and he has a hangover.

01:01:10.042 --> 01:01:12.579
I preferred your look in the other play.

01:01:14.667 --> 01:01:16.703
Could you start reading, please?

01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:22.619
"I think I've drunk too much".

01:01:23.167 --> 01:01:24.327
"Did you hear that?

01:01:24.958 --> 01:01:26.164
I think it's a cat.

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:29.456
Kitty!

01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:32.537
What bastard abandoned you?"

01:01:33.708 --> 01:01:36.541
"There's no excuse
for abandoning an animal.

01:01:37.625 --> 01:01:39.240
He's an ugly bastard".

01:01:39.542 --> 01:01:40.952
You have to project.

01:01:41.417 --> 01:01:43.499
Ernesto can't hear you.

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:46.786
Tell him to come closer.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.958
The whole theatre has to hear you.
Project!

01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:52.950
"There's no excuse
for abandoning an animal".

01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:54.208
Louder.

01:01:55.042 --> 01:01:58.580
"There's no excuse
for abandoning an animal".

01:01:58.875 --> 01:02:00.615
"You're a bloody spoiler machine

01:02:00.708 --> 01:02:03.074
the red wedding, twin peaks
and now the book".

01:02:03.167 --> 01:02:05.829
"I ruined Hamlet for you?"
"I didn't know ofelia died."

01:02:05.958 --> 01:02:08.244
I thought you knew
because it's bloody Hamlet

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:10.494
after 400 years, it's not a spoiler...

01:02:10.583 --> 01:02:14.326
"Stop denying me things!
You do it on purpose, to show me up.

01:02:14.417 --> 01:02:15.748
You know I haven't read it".

01:02:15.833 --> 01:02:17.164
"Prepare yourself,

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:20.617
because sleeping beauty wakes up
and Romeo and Juliet die".

01:02:20.792 --> 01:02:23.158
"I know, I saw the film".

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.582
This didn't really happen.
Right...

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.492
- Sorry, what did you say?
- Can you project a bit more?

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:37.121
"You won't believe it.
I've found my favourite childhood film.

01:02:40.542 --> 01:02:42.828
Cucumber fest in the girl's school",

01:02:42.958 --> 01:02:44.664
you have to project your voice.

01:02:45.375 --> 01:02:47.832
Sorry, Mario, we all have to hear you.

01:02:48.125 --> 01:02:50.457
The voice has to come from your stomach.

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:52.782
It's not that easy.

01:02:52.875 --> 01:02:56.948
Imagine that it starts in your stomach
and comes out from your mouth.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.616
"Cucumber fest in the girl's school”.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.332
That's it, very good, fantastic.

01:03:07.333 --> 01:03:09.449
So, what role am I playing?

01:03:12.583 --> 01:03:15.495
Let's go to the famous scene
about the pill-head cat.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:18.950
Mylove had to take a tablet
for his kidneys.

01:03:21.125 --> 01:03:24.663
Come on, mylove.
Tak' th' tablet, it's guid fur ye.

01:03:25.167 --> 01:03:26.167
Come on.

01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:29.117
The drug addict cat
hitting all the clubs.

01:03:30.792 --> 01:03:32.578
It's fur yer kidney, mylove.

01:03:32.958 --> 01:03:33.958
Come on...

01:03:36.125 --> 01:03:37.160
Let's see, oli,

01:03:37.875 --> 01:03:38.875
don't worry.

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:40.698
Let's think,

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:44.951
what's the best way to make
someone take a pill?

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:48.240
Listening to dance music.

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:51.866
Dae ye want th' pill?

01:03:57.708 --> 01:03:59.164
The first one is free.

01:05:11.125 --> 01:05:12.865
You two are really going for it.

01:05:13.375 --> 01:05:15.616
This has been oddly good,
let's move on.

01:05:15.708 --> 01:05:17.323
Fuck me stanislavski.

01:05:17.792 --> 01:05:20.158
If you relax, the audience relaxes.

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:21.625
Oli,

01:05:22.375 --> 01:05:23.490
we need to talk.

01:05:23.583 --> 01:05:25.244
Alright, I'm off.

01:05:25.583 --> 01:05:27.574
I wanted to tell you something too.

01:05:39.792 --> 01:05:41.453
I don't know how to say this.

01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:44.074
The day I told you that mylove died,

01:05:44.667 --> 01:05:47.830
I was at your house
because I wanted to tell you something.

01:05:47.958 --> 01:05:51.576
But Matt was there naked and...
He was wearing trousers.

01:05:52.542 --> 01:05:55.830
- In my head he was naked.
- I'm going to marry Matt.

01:05:56.208 --> 01:05:57.208
You're kidding?

01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:58.865
With the black guy?

01:05:59.583 --> 01:06:01.619
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:04.408
We're taking the immigration test again.

01:06:06.667 --> 01:06:08.999
And like last time, you didn't tell me.

01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:11.582
You didn't want me to tell you,
remember?

01:06:13.167 --> 01:06:14.167
Alright.

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:15.250
Ok.

01:06:16.708 --> 01:06:18.619
You wanted to tell me something?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.490
No, no... nothing.

01:06:22.458 --> 01:06:23.573
Nothing at all. 0k.

01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:26.449
Fancy it?
Impossible, I'm really busy.

01:06:26.542 --> 01:06:29.739
- Not even a quick half?
- I'm stupidly busy today.

01:06:29.833 --> 01:06:30.572
Another day.

01:06:30.625 --> 01:06:32.616
- Fine, see you.
- Bye.

01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:34.949
Eva, are you busy tonight?

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:36.500
No, why?

01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:39.495
I'm a bit rusty on a few scenes,

01:06:39.708 --> 01:06:41.244
perhaps you could help me?

01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:43.411
I've got whisky at home.

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:46.996
That would help you
really get into the character of Olivia.

01:06:48.667 --> 01:06:49.406
Alright...

01:06:49.667 --> 01:06:50.667
Why not?

01:06:51.083 --> 01:06:52.083
Why not?

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:54.615
How cute. What's his name?

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:56.750
Socks.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.491
- Socks?
- Yes, he likes them a lot.

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:00.789
He gobbles them up.

01:07:04.083 --> 01:07:06.324
The thing between
you and Olivia is bizarre.

01:07:06.417 --> 01:07:07.417
Bizarre, why?

01:07:07.625 --> 01:07:09.240
She's decided to marry Matt,

01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:11.081
and I wish them all the best.

01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:16.995
We've drunk half a bottle
and we haven't even started.

01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:20.535
Well, test me.

01:07:20.792 --> 01:07:23.454
Read any page, I know it all.
0k,

01:07:29.458 --> 01:07:31.870
"Olivia laughs,
looks at Mario and they kiss".

01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:38.241
But, did you read that page...

01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:40.699
By chance or...?

01:07:41.167 --> 01:07:42.703
I'm almost completely sure.

01:07:56.542 --> 01:07:57.542
Olivia...

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:00.615
My name's Eva.

01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:02.581
Or are we still rehearsing?

01:08:20.707 --> 01:08:23.040
When did your partner last menstruate?

01:08:24.082 --> 01:08:25.082
What?

01:08:27.207 --> 01:08:29.415
Sorry, sorry, that wasn't for you.

01:08:31.332 --> 01:08:33.038
Does your fiancé have tattoos?

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:34.201
Yes.

01:08:34.417 --> 01:08:36.499
She's got a sexy one on her hip.

01:08:37.082 --> 01:08:38.948
It's sexy because it's on her bum.

01:08:39.667 --> 01:08:41.783
It's Karl Marx in a heart.

01:08:42.582 --> 01:08:43.948
It scares me a lot.

01:09:00.375 --> 01:09:02.616
Socks won't stop looking at my bum.

01:09:04.582 --> 01:09:06.948
He misses Carlos Marx.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:08.500
Who?

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:10.250
Nevermind.

01:09:10.542 --> 01:09:11.542
Go on, get oot.

01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:12.788
Get oot. Oot.

01:09:15.042 --> 01:09:16.327
Is that Irish?

01:09:17.125 --> 01:09:18.581
No, it's Scottish.

01:09:19.957 --> 01:09:20.957
Right.

01:09:22.582 --> 01:09:26.451
This test is to identify whether
this is a marriage of convenience.

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:28.456
It is not a joke.

01:09:28.542 --> 01:09:30.703
What marriage isn't for convenience?

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:33.457
If you marry for citizenship
it's illegal.

01:09:33.542 --> 01:09:35.624
But if you're hung like a horse?

01:09:36.082 --> 01:09:37.493
Isn't that for convenience?

01:09:37.582 --> 01:09:39.493
We only want to know

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.160
is if you're in love.

01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:43.707
Do you realise how arrogant that sounds?

01:09:44.542 --> 01:09:48.581
Isn't it reason enough to fall in love
because that person needs you?

01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:53.411
I honestly don't know.

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.707
Or fall in love
because they make you laugh?

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:56.989
Or get it wrong

01:09:57.125 --> 01:09:59.161
and choose an idiot for a partner.

01:09:59.458 --> 01:10:01.699
Isn't that our most personal right?

01:10:04.083 --> 01:10:07.155
- Of course it's our right.
- Of course.

01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:09.707
I need to call Victoria,
I'm mad about her.

01:10:09.792 --> 01:10:11.828
- Call Victoria!
- She's my sister.

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.160
Yes,

01:10:14.333 --> 01:10:15.333
adopted, ok?

01:10:15.583 --> 01:10:17.039
Love is free.

01:10:17.208 --> 01:10:19.119
Love is free. Excuse me.

01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:23.333
Vicky!

01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:25.243
I love you, Victoria!

01:10:25.833 --> 01:10:27.039
No, no, no,

01:10:27.250 --> 01:10:28.581
I've never been better.

01:10:28.792 --> 01:10:30.077
I'm thinking clearly.

01:10:39.125 --> 01:10:40.240
Do you miss 'er too?

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:44.786
We'll see her again soon, ah swear.

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:49.079
I just need th' reit time
to tell her you're not kaput.

01:10:50.833 --> 01:10:52.243
I'm sure she'll understand.

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:56.452
Yeah, you're right,

01:10:58.542 --> 01:10:59.542
she'll kill me.

01:11:00.875 --> 01:11:03.116
But I'll tell her tomorrow, alright?

01:11:08.375 --> 01:11:09.375
Eva.

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:11.240
I'm going to the theatre.

01:11:11.458 --> 01:11:13.073
Don't leave yet,

01:11:13.167 --> 01:11:16.534
I don't want Olivia to find out,
Olivia or anyone else.

01:11:17.583 --> 01:11:20.655
Nobody needs to find out,
this is really bad.

01:11:21.667 --> 01:11:23.623
Give me a sign if you're hungover.

01:11:24.458 --> 01:11:26.790
Ok, look,
I've brought you an aspirin.

01:11:28.583 --> 01:11:30.744
Take it when you get up.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.331
And when you leave

01:11:32.875 --> 01:11:35.082
pull the door until it goes "clack",

01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:36.202
then forget it all.

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:36.947
Alright?

01:11:37.083 --> 01:11:38.198
There's the aspirin.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Shit.

01:12:07.042 --> 01:12:08.042
Socks.

01:12:09.583 --> 01:12:10.583
Socks.

01:12:13.042 --> 01:12:14.042
Stop, mylove.

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:20.666
That's it, very good.

01:12:21.083 --> 01:12:22.573
Good boy, good boy.

01:12:22.708 --> 01:12:24.414
Come here, come here.

01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:27.323
So you're mylove.

01:12:29.833 --> 01:12:31.164
My friend!

01:12:34.375 --> 01:12:35.375
Hey!

01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:37.081
Shall we start?

01:12:37.792 --> 01:12:39.578
I don't think so because...

01:12:39.708 --> 01:12:42.245
Eva's not here.
I think she's running late.

01:12:42.375 --> 01:12:43.034
Why's that?

01:12:43.375 --> 01:12:45.036
I don't know. The truth is...

01:12:45.125 --> 01:12:47.582
Why are we talking about Eva?
What nonsense.

01:12:47.875 --> 01:12:48.990
So... oli,

01:12:49.375 --> 01:12:50.785
I need to tell you something.

01:12:50.875 --> 01:12:53.366
Well, a few things and it's not easy.
Mario...

01:12:53.875 --> 01:12:54.875
Please.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.115
Let me go first, ok?

01:12:57.375 --> 01:12:58.535
The first thing is

01:12:58.667 --> 01:13:00.248
I need you to open your mind

01:13:00.625 --> 01:13:02.991
and secondly, stay calm.

01:13:04.042 --> 01:13:05.828
It's about us and the...

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:08.583
The?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.206
Actually? I...

01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:13.662
Let's talk later, alright?
A bit... later.

01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:15.581
What... I wanted to say that...

01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:18.780
Sorry for making things difficult,
but I think...

01:13:18.958 --> 01:13:22.405
Because I also feel...
Of course. Yes, yes, yes.

01:13:22.583 --> 01:13:25.700
Yes, I understand, very interesting,
but I have to go.

01:13:25.833 --> 01:13:28.074
Because I've got a situation,
a big one.

01:13:28.375 --> 01:13:29.831
- You understand, right?
- Yes.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.115
Yes? Great.

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:33.241
- So... talk later?
- Yes, of course.

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:40.865
Tell me I'm not paranoid.

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:42.578
You didn't bring a cat?

01:13:42.708 --> 01:13:44.824
He escaped and the door went "clack".

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.867
- What the hell do we do?
- It's Olivia's, right?

01:13:49.583 --> 01:13:50.663
- Both of ours.
- Look,

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:54.618
my hangover is too bad to listen
to Olivia shouting when she finds out

01:13:54.708 --> 01:13:55.708
I'm leaving.

01:13:57.167 --> 01:13:57.747
Go for it,

01:13:58.042 --> 01:13:59.042
good luck.

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:03.162
Stay there, stay thare, thore, thure.

01:14:09.208 --> 01:14:09.867
Hey Ernesto,

01:14:10.042 --> 01:14:13.000
I'm a bit rough.
Why don't we cancel the rehearsal?

01:14:13.083 --> 01:14:15.790
We've got it down.
Go get a beer, I'll close up.

01:14:16.208 --> 01:14:17.573
It's ten in the morning.

01:14:18.125 --> 01:14:20.116
Ten is the new twelve.

01:14:20.208 --> 01:14:23.700
Stop talking nonsense.
Let's see how good this punch bag is.

01:14:29.167 --> 01:14:32.079
- Why don't we leave this for tomorrow?
- No way.

01:14:32.208 --> 01:14:33.493
Alright, page 45.

01:14:34.042 --> 01:14:35.042
Come on.

01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:39.583
Come on.

01:14:44.625 --> 01:14:46.081
Wait, wait, wait.

01:14:47.792 --> 01:14:48.792
Remember?

01:14:50.958 --> 01:14:52.619
How could I forget?

01:14:52.833 --> 01:14:54.824
- Let's leave it, no?
- Seriously?

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:57.615
The first thing I learnt to do

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.115
was to sweep

01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:00.330
to iron

01:15:00.417 --> 01:15:02.032
to wash and to sew

01:15:02.458 --> 01:15:04.665
but seeing that these things

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:06.490
- stop it, eh?
- Yes.

01:15:08.125 --> 01:15:09.240
That won't do!

01:15:09.458 --> 01:15:10.823
It'll do - no.

01:15:11.375 --> 01:15:13.115
You stop it. Come on then.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:24.572
Considering how much you like drama,
you're not so bad at comedy.

01:15:33.583 --> 01:15:35.244
Ah, you're improvising.

01:15:35.583 --> 01:15:38.620
Alright... well,
I'm going for a smoke.

01:15:39.042 --> 01:15:40.498
I'll leave you... alone.

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:47.952
I'm sorry, Olivia,

01:15:48.792 --> 01:15:50.874
sorry for everything that's happened.

01:15:51.208 --> 01:15:52.994
If only it could be like before.

01:15:54.042 --> 01:15:56.579
And there's something
I want to tell you...

01:15:56.708 --> 01:15:58.039
I'm sorry too.

01:15:59.583 --> 01:16:02.165
I don't even know why we broke up.

01:16:02.833 --> 01:16:04.869
Because we were scared of breaking up.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.740
What a fucking stupid reason.

01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:27.833
Oh!

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.080
A cat?

01:16:30.708 --> 01:16:33.666
For a moment I thought it was...
He's really similar.

01:16:34.125 --> 01:16:36.366
Kitty, you're the same as mylove.

01:16:37.333 --> 01:16:39.574
There was something I needed to explain,

01:16:39.792 --> 01:16:40.792
but... what?

01:16:41.792 --> 01:16:45.580
Mylove wasn't quite so dead.

01:16:47.208 --> 01:16:49.824
I mean, I made it up a bit.
That's mylove?

01:16:51.083 --> 01:16:52.083
Mylove!

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.865
Mylove, is that you?

01:16:57.167 --> 01:16:58.167
Mylove...

01:16:58.708 --> 01:16:59.708
Hello.

01:17:00.792 --> 01:17:01.792
Hello!

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:09.490
You're a monster!

01:17:14.167 --> 01:17:17.614
It's good news.
You used to think he was dead.

01:17:17.708 --> 01:17:18.538
Murderer!

01:17:18.667 --> 01:17:20.498
Yes, murderer, but not for real.

01:17:20.583 --> 01:17:21.789
I messed up, alright.

01:17:22.042 --> 01:17:23.782
We scattered his ashes!

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:28.412
But isn't it great that he's alive.
Think about it!

01:17:32.833 --> 01:17:34.414
I never want to see you again.

01:17:55.583 --> 01:17:57.073
He's in one heck of a coma.

01:17:57.375 --> 01:17:59.491
Not surprising with the blow he took.

01:17:59.667 --> 01:18:00.667
What's his name?

01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:02.250
Mylove.

01:18:02.792 --> 01:18:03.952
He's called mylove.

01:18:04.833 --> 01:18:05.538
Lovely name.

01:18:05.583 --> 01:18:08.996
He responds to mylove,
but officially it's schrodinger

01:18:09.083 --> 01:18:11.039
after schrddinger's cat.

01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:12.539
Yes, I got it.

01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:15.161
I have to tell you that...

01:18:16.375 --> 01:18:19.208
There's a 50% chance he won't wake up.

01:18:23.375 --> 01:18:24.990
Like schrddinger's cat.

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.331
I'll let you know if anything changes.

01:18:29.417 --> 01:18:30.076
Excuse me?

01:18:30.417 --> 01:18:32.954
I'll know if anything changes,
he's my cat too.

01:18:33.583 --> 01:18:36.370
No, he's not your cat.
Forget that. He's mine.

01:18:37.125 --> 01:18:38.490
Talk tomorrow at rehearsals.

01:18:38.583 --> 01:18:41.370
Don't even think about coming.
You're out of the play!

01:18:51.792 --> 01:18:55.705
That will be decided by the producer,
which, by the way, is me.

01:18:55.833 --> 01:18:58.700
Do you really want this?
Do you want to start a war?

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.456
The war has already started.

01:19:00.625 --> 01:19:02.365
I don't want to see you in the theatre.

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.367
Best you don't go there then.
Drive.

01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:17.870
Right, now we have a surprise.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.082
A comedian that is all the rage.

01:19:20.167 --> 01:19:23.125
And today he's bringing us
a new style of comedy.

01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:24.250
Hold on tight.

01:19:24.583 --> 01:19:25.583
The great...

01:19:26.708 --> 01:19:28.824
Mario laguna, an applause please!

01:19:46.708 --> 01:19:49.370
Have you ever found yourself entering

01:19:49.708 --> 01:19:51.699
that strange dynamic when

01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:55.705
you try to make life impossible
for the person you love the most?

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:59.742
And she tries to hurt you
in every possible way and...

01:20:00.042 --> 01:20:01.703
And you do the same to her.

01:20:02.167 --> 01:20:03.532
But you want it to stop.

01:20:04.542 --> 01:20:07.204
But you only make it worse.

01:20:08.125 --> 01:20:09.240
That happened to me.

01:20:10.542 --> 01:20:14.080
I don't know how we got so low, but...

01:20:14.875 --> 01:20:15.990
The other day

01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:18.244
I drifted off for one minute.

01:20:19.833 --> 01:20:22.199
I swear it was only one minute.

01:20:22.625 --> 01:20:24.957
What are you doing?
They're looking for you.

01:20:25.042 --> 01:20:26.042
I'm almost done.

01:20:26.125 --> 01:20:27.331
Done with what?

01:20:29.583 --> 01:20:30.583
Fuck me!

01:20:32.708 --> 01:20:33.788
He'll wake up.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.832
I put three sleeping pills in his beer.

01:20:44.208 --> 01:20:46.244
Do you know how hard henna is to remove?

01:20:55.667 --> 01:20:57.077
"I think with my dick.”

01:20:59.458 --> 01:21:03.781
You have no idea how difficult it is
to remove a henna tattoo.

01:21:04.958 --> 01:21:08.655
I scrubbed my forehead so hard,
that it hurts a lot, my forehead.

01:21:10.542 --> 01:21:11.542
I mean,

01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:12.667
it's not that I...

01:21:14.417 --> 01:21:15.532
Have been a Saint.

01:21:15.875 --> 01:21:17.786
Let's go to the first kiss scene.

01:21:17.875 --> 01:21:20.241
Let's see if the false door works.

01:21:22.708 --> 01:21:25.825
That's what I meant
when I said Olivia is always angry.

01:21:26.375 --> 01:21:27.375
What's wrong?

01:21:29.875 --> 01:21:30.875
What's wrong?

01:21:33.042 --> 01:21:34.327
And then, the usual.

01:21:34.792 --> 01:21:36.874
Itching powder in underwear,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.991
salt instead of sugar in coffee...

01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:42.115
It still had a certain humour.

01:21:42.333 --> 01:21:45.450
- This is getting out of hand
- Danny, don't worry.

01:21:45.542 --> 01:21:46.782
They're just innocent jokes.

01:21:46.875 --> 01:21:48.365
Come on, take me a photo

01:21:48.708 --> 01:21:51.575
you haven't read one script
that I've sent you.

01:21:51.708 --> 01:21:54.324
I'm more focussed on theatre now.

01:21:54.458 --> 01:21:57.780
It's a much superior form
of artistic expression.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:01.323
What are you doing?

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.119
Take a photo of my asshole.

01:22:04.042 --> 01:22:07.580
Make it as disgusting as you can.
Let's see if I have a bad side.

01:22:08.417 --> 01:22:09.577
Mario, for god's sake...

01:22:09.708 --> 01:22:12.415
Olivia always complained
she wanted hot pictures

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:15.822
and I never sent her any.
Micro-sexism on my part.

01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:17.250
Go for it.

01:22:19.208 --> 01:22:20.208
Yes?

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:23.663
Some areas are difficult to illuminate.
Turn the flash on.

01:22:30.167 --> 01:22:31.532
All I want is...

01:22:31.708 --> 01:22:32.948
To say sorry

01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:34.581
and to end all this.

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:39.201
I also want her to say sorry.
The same happened to me.

01:22:39.333 --> 01:22:42.245
Excuse me, can you pass this to Mario?

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:45.199
Damn, I'm inventing a new genre:

01:22:45.667 --> 01:22:46.873
Stand-up drama.

01:22:48.083 --> 01:22:49.083
Here, Mario.

01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:51.250
Thanks.

01:22:53.167 --> 01:22:54.657
Stand-up drama

01:22:56.667 --> 01:23:00.580
consists in standing here saying things
that aren't fucking funny.

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.240
I think I've got it nailed.

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.036
Shit! What the hell!

01:23:11.792 --> 01:23:13.328
This is tabasco!

01:23:13.542 --> 01:23:15.373
It was her! It was her!

01:23:15.583 --> 01:23:17.073
Where are you, witch?

01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:24.036
I wasn't expecting so many people.

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:25.789
Mario is very famous.

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.707
He's the best son-in-law we've ever had.

01:23:34.333 --> 01:23:35.698
The poster is weird.

01:23:37.042 --> 01:23:39.454
I'm hung like a field mouse

01:23:39.792 --> 01:23:41.874
he can't be hung like a field mouse?

01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:43.083
I hope not.

01:23:43.417 --> 01:23:44.417
He's so cute.

01:23:47.583 --> 01:23:49.995
I don't have a dick like a mouse!

01:23:50.875 --> 01:23:52.991
- He's so funny...
- He's a sweetie...

01:23:54.417 --> 01:23:55.156
Guys,

01:23:55.333 --> 01:23:57.574
the theatre is full.
Thanks to me.

01:23:57.625 --> 01:23:59.616
Ten minutes until we open.

01:23:59.708 --> 01:24:02.575
Put your differences aside
for the play, ok?

01:24:02.667 --> 01:24:06.205
I've no problem putting anything aside,
if she just apologises.

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:10.412
Me say sorry to you? Cat killer!

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.582
This has gone to far!

01:24:12.625 --> 01:24:15.037
I don't want to watch you
kill each other on stage.

01:24:15.125 --> 01:24:17.582
Bye guys.
Lots, but lots of luck.

01:24:17.792 --> 01:24:21.580
Don't wish us luck, this is theatre!
They say break a leg.

01:24:22.708 --> 01:24:25.450
Someone has looked up
theatre on Wikipedia.

01:24:25.542 --> 01:24:28.955
Yes, someone was searching on Wikipedia
for your name.

01:24:29.042 --> 01:24:30.657
Guess what it said? Nothing.

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:32.744
Do you know why?
You're not there.

01:24:32.875 --> 01:24:33.875
And I am.

01:24:34.125 --> 01:24:37.242
Guys, I want a gesture
of friendship right now.

01:24:39.333 --> 01:24:40.333
Now.

01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:48.539
Break a leg, Mario.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.581
Break a leg, Olivia.

01:24:52.958 --> 01:24:56.371
You always had strong hands.
For a girl.

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:57.664
Micro-sexist.

01:24:58.083 --> 01:24:59.198
Macro-idiot.

01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:02.787
By the way,
because you removed the eyebrows,

01:25:03.125 --> 01:25:04.535
I've got you a present.

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:11.500
Massive brows.

01:25:11.583 --> 01:25:14.495
- To wear tonight.
- Thanks a lot.

01:25:14.667 --> 01:25:17.158
As you've still got traces
of the dick on your head,

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:18.706
I've brought you something.

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:23.956
Break a leg, Mario

01:25:27.667 --> 01:25:28.747
you might prefer it.

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:31.706
You disgusting bitch...

01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:35.250
Wipe here.

01:25:45.625 --> 01:25:47.331
- It's starting.
- Great.

01:26:02.167 --> 01:26:04.453
It was Wednesday at five in the morning,

01:26:04.542 --> 01:26:06.578
and I was as drunk as a skunk.

01:26:08.542 --> 01:26:11.079
Aren't her eyebrows a bit big?

01:26:12.833 --> 01:26:14.323
That's a micro-sexism.

01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:19.244
Maybe she's tired of the patriarchy
forcing her into waxing them.

01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:21.660
- Right.
- "Graceful..."

01:26:31.833 --> 01:26:32.833
Animal!

01:26:32.875 --> 01:26:34.035
Break a leg.

01:26:34.167 --> 01:26:35.202
Literally.

01:26:36.583 --> 01:26:40.701
- Do you think they hurt themselves?
- No, it's all choreography.

01:26:40.792 --> 01:26:41.792
Are you ok?

01:26:41.958 --> 01:26:44.074
Do you want to go for dinner one day?

01:26:44.417 --> 01:26:45.417
What?

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.160
If we ended up together,

01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:50.162
we'd have an amazing story
about how we met.

01:26:50.250 --> 01:26:51.956
Like notting hill on steroids.

01:26:58.208 --> 01:27:00.244
We play something similar in my village,

01:27:00.375 --> 01:27:01.660
it was called "drink".

01:27:03.333 --> 01:27:04.743
You first. Don't be sexist.

01:27:04.833 --> 01:27:06.539
- Please, you first.
- Alright.

01:27:19.625 --> 01:27:21.456
That's vinegar, bitch.

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:31.500
Soap?

01:27:36.542 --> 01:27:38.248
You wet the bed once.

01:27:38.958 --> 01:27:41.995
- Fuck, oli, I was drunk.
- You were stood up, aiming.

01:27:45.833 --> 01:27:48.074
A present, from my field mouse to you.

01:27:55.083 --> 01:27:56.118
Mylove!

01:27:56.708 --> 01:27:59.495
How are you mylove?
This is for you.

01:28:07.042 --> 01:28:09.249
Nothing, he must be in the bathroom.

01:28:16.083 --> 01:28:17.243
Is that tabasco?

01:28:18.375 --> 01:28:19.375
It's not funny,

01:28:19.708 --> 01:28:21.118
that one's already done.

01:28:23.792 --> 01:28:24.792
Last shot.

01:28:25.417 --> 01:28:26.623
For the lady.

01:28:33.542 --> 01:28:35.407
It's good, I'm scared.
What is it?

01:28:36.542 --> 01:28:37.657
Almond milk.

01:28:39.125 --> 01:28:41.036
But I'm allergic, you psycho!

01:28:41.208 --> 01:28:43.415
Don't you like
the theatre of cruelty?

01:28:43.542 --> 01:28:45.954
How would I know?
We only just met.

01:28:46.042 --> 01:28:48.124
Mario, I'm allergic! What?

01:28:48.208 --> 01:28:49.618
I need adrenaline!

01:28:49.708 --> 01:28:51.244
- What do you need?
- Adrenaline!

01:28:51.333 --> 01:28:53.369
Adrenaline! Look, what luck!

01:28:53.708 --> 01:28:56.165
I happen to have
a little bit of adrenaline.

01:28:56.417 --> 01:28:58.703
Give it to me...
Who wants adrenaline?

01:28:58.958 --> 01:29:00.198
Mario, honestly!

01:29:01.458 --> 01:29:02.698
I'll give it to you,

01:29:02.833 --> 01:29:04.824
if you say please

01:29:05.250 --> 01:29:06.615
to my great big cock.

01:29:07.708 --> 01:29:08.708
Mario!

01:29:12.625 --> 01:29:14.581
Olivia is fantastic.

01:29:14.708 --> 01:29:16.369
I'm really impressed.

01:29:16.667 --> 01:29:18.032
Ah sorry, I messed up,

01:29:18.125 --> 01:29:20.537
it wasn't almond milk,
it was a syrup.

01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:23.492
The first night has made me go all...

01:29:27.708 --> 01:29:29.664
Oli, oli, oli, oli!

01:29:30.125 --> 01:29:31.865
Oli you're losing it. Oli, oli!

01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:40.823
- I told you it would go badly.
- I'm sure that as it's the opening night

01:29:40.958 --> 01:29:42.539
they'll be taking it steady.

01:29:43.958 --> 01:29:44.958
It's Eva.

01:29:46.458 --> 01:29:49.165
- What.
- Ernesto, there's a brawl on stage.

01:29:49.375 --> 01:29:51.240
- Not steady at all.
- People are laughing.

01:29:51.333 --> 01:29:53.073
They think it's part of the play.

01:29:53.708 --> 01:29:54.708
Yes? Who is it?

01:29:55.708 --> 01:29:56.788
It's the vet.

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:58.573
That's great news.

01:29:59.083 --> 01:30:00.823
The cat is out of the coma.

01:30:00.958 --> 01:30:03.165
Perfect,
ask if we can pick him up.

01:30:03.250 --> 01:30:05.241
- One moment.
- I'm not talking to you.

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:08.871
- Where are you?
- We're getting the cat. It's better.

01:30:09.875 --> 01:30:10.875
Thank god.

01:30:12.542 --> 01:30:13.542
Bye.

01:30:13.833 --> 01:30:14.833
Bye.

01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:23.083
We've seen half of
Woody Allen's filmography.

01:30:23.583 --> 01:30:26.199
We were on the point
of becoming friends.

01:30:27.250 --> 01:30:30.083
What are you doing?
I want to do a monologue too.

01:30:30.167 --> 01:30:31.703
Fine, fine, fine.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.536
When you meet a girl

01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:36.956
and you make friends,

01:30:37.042 --> 01:30:39.533
you can no longer have feelings for her.

01:30:39.583 --> 01:30:42.575
So I didn't want to make friends
with Olivia because...

01:30:43.083 --> 01:30:45.244
Because I was falling in love with her.

01:30:47.833 --> 01:30:50.324
Culebra got a tattoo
with "Olivia" in a heart.

01:30:50.458 --> 01:30:51.458
And?

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.580
Olivia with a h.

01:30:52.875 --> 01:30:54.160
I had to do something.

01:30:55.625 --> 01:30:57.206
Yes, yes, yes?

01:30:58.250 --> 01:30:59.865
- Olivia?
- Yes, what is it?

01:31:00.125 --> 01:31:03.322
I think I left my phone in your house.
Well...

01:31:03.542 --> 01:31:06.705
- I don't see it.
- I can't manage without my phone.

01:31:06.833 --> 01:31:08.073
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:08.708 --> 01:31:10.699
What do I do? Want to come look?

01:31:10.833 --> 01:31:13.540
- You don't mind?
- Come on, come on.

01:31:13.625 --> 01:31:14.625
Ok.

01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:36.582
Hey, mylove! He's done so well!

01:31:37.375 --> 01:31:38.410
Strong as an ox.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Kitty,

01:31:40.375 --> 01:31:42.036
right now your parents

01:31:42.167 --> 01:31:44.704
are about to kill each other on stage.

01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:48.037
You could have put "lost cat”
or "missing cat".

01:31:48.167 --> 01:31:51.079
With the cat's name underneath.
This is like...

01:31:51.250 --> 01:31:54.447
The joke about
the dog called titswobble.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000
What are you doing?

01:32:04.042 --> 01:32:05.532
I'm starting to like this.

01:32:06.125 --> 01:32:07.456
More and more.

01:32:10.125 --> 01:32:12.457
Hitching? What sort of psychopath

01:32:12.542 --> 01:32:14.874
will pick us up at this time of night?

01:32:17.125 --> 01:32:18.831
Do you need a ride somewhere?

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:20.500
This psychopath.

01:32:22.583 --> 01:32:23.583
There we go.

01:32:23.625 --> 01:32:24.865
I'm in the police.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Well, I was.

01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:29.575
They sacked me for throwing some kids
from a boat to save them

01:32:29.667 --> 01:32:32.033
from an explosion that I caused

01:32:32.167 --> 01:32:34.499
to catch a Colombian drug dealer

01:32:34.583 --> 01:32:37.325
who ripped me off
selling me really bad cocaine...

01:32:37.417 --> 01:32:40.454
Anyway, let's do this. Emergency!
Emergency of love!

01:32:40.542 --> 01:32:42.533
Of love!

01:32:51.417 --> 01:32:53.248
- Fuck!
- Mylove's ashes.

01:32:54.125 --> 01:32:55.786
When I introduced him to my dad

01:32:55.875 --> 01:32:58.537
he asked what Cologne
he wears and bought the same.

01:32:58.708 --> 01:33:01.495
It's been like fucking my father
ever since.

01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:05.411
What's up?
You do monologues now?

01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:09.367
When she told me she was marrying Matt,
I already had the ring

01:33:09.458 --> 01:33:13.952
because I wanted to marry her.
I was ready to kneel, but...

01:33:14.542 --> 01:33:15.873
I never dared say it.

01:33:16.042 --> 01:33:18.624
Do you know
what a turtle's orgasm is like?

01:33:23.583 --> 01:33:25.414
The same as Mario's.

01:33:27.083 --> 01:33:28.083
When we broke up,

01:33:28.417 --> 01:33:29.702
I became a zombie,

01:33:29.792 --> 01:33:30.998
a soul in torment.

01:33:31.667 --> 01:33:34.579
Yes, I went out,
had beers with friends,

01:33:34.667 --> 01:33:36.077
talked to them, but...

01:33:38.083 --> 01:33:39.083
It was incredible.

01:33:39.375 --> 01:33:41.036
They didn't even realise

01:33:41.958 --> 01:33:43.448
I was dead inside.

01:33:43.667 --> 01:33:46.500
- He's an outstanding actor.
- And he smells great.

01:33:47.083 --> 01:33:49.540
Do you know what my orgasms
with Mario were like?

01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:50.409
No?

01:33:50.708 --> 01:33:51.788
Me neither!

01:34:00.042 --> 01:34:01.122
Oli, what's wrong?

01:34:05.083 --> 01:34:06.083
What's wrong?

01:34:06.708 --> 01:34:07.743
Adrenaline.

01:34:07.833 --> 01:34:09.573
There were no nuts...

01:34:10.208 --> 01:34:11.208
It was syrup.

01:34:12.375 --> 01:34:14.206
Oli, oli, you're scaring me.

01:34:14.250 --> 01:34:15.706
Oli, oli, oli!

01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:18.750
Oli!

01:34:21.833 --> 01:34:22.833
Oli!

01:34:24.333 --> 01:34:25.333
Oli!

01:34:25.458 --> 01:34:26.458
Oli!

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:27.580
Oli, Olivia!

01:34:29.375 --> 01:34:30.375
Help!

01:34:39.417 --> 01:34:40.417
She's not breathing.

01:34:40.667 --> 01:34:43.158
- Eva, call a doctor.
- I'm going.

01:35:00.125 --> 01:35:01.125
Oli.

01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:02.250
Oli.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.331
What have we done?

01:35:06.042 --> 01:35:07.703
Fuck, what have we done, oli?

01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:09.750
Oli.

01:35:09.833 --> 01:35:11.994
I just wanted you to forgive me.

01:35:22.625 --> 01:35:25.241
Fuck! What have we done?
Who am I?

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.241
I just wanted you to forgive me.

01:35:28.708 --> 01:35:29.788
I'm you.

01:35:32.708 --> 01:35:33.948
Now you know how it feels

01:35:34.042 --> 01:35:36.875
when you think
someone you love has died.

01:35:44.167 --> 01:35:45.167
What's up?

01:35:45.708 --> 01:35:46.708
Do you find it funny?

01:35:48.875 --> 01:35:50.615
It was a horrific joke.

01:35:51.583 --> 01:35:52.663
Why are you laughing?

01:35:53.542 --> 01:35:55.373
It's not funny at all.

01:35:57.458 --> 01:35:58.789
It's a dreadful joke.

01:36:00.542 --> 01:36:01.542
But,

01:36:02.625 --> 01:36:04.832
the other option was you not waking up.

01:36:07.542 --> 01:36:09.407
So I think it was wonderful.

01:36:45.875 --> 01:36:46.875
Mylove!

01:36:48.250 --> 01:36:49.706
Mylove, yoo're awe rite.

01:36:50.583 --> 01:36:52.039
- Mylove.
- Hey!

01:36:58.167 --> 01:36:59.532
- Mylove.
- Hello.

01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:02.250
Hello.

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:03.789
Tell me whit tae dae,

01:37:04.083 --> 01:37:05.243

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:07.831
Whit did the Lassie say?

01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:11.535
He says och aye.

01:37:47.792 --> 01:37:48.998
Mario is perfect.

01:37:50.250 --> 01:37:52.411
The best boyfriend she's ever had.

01:37:54.167 --> 01:37:55.327
Alright, Olivia,

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.866
do you consent to
and accept to enter into marriage?

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.365
Yes, but I mean...

01:38:00.333 --> 01:38:03.951
Saying "yes, I consent" sounds terrible,
like I had no choice.

01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:06.240
Then say, "yes, I accept".

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:08.786
Alright, well yes, I accept.
I accept.

01:38:09.083 --> 01:38:10.323
Very well.

01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:12.248
- And you, Mateo...
- Matt.

01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:14.206
That's it. And you, Matt,

01:38:14.250 --> 01:38:17.367
do you consent to
and accept to enter into marriage?

01:38:17.667 --> 01:38:18.667
Yes,

01:38:20.042 --> 01:38:21.202
I consent.

01:38:21.458 --> 01:38:24.780
Very well. You may kiss now,

01:38:24.958 --> 01:38:26.789
or not, if you don't want to...

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.116
We don't know why you're marrying...

01:38:29.208 --> 01:38:31.073
I won't say a word,
it's fine by me.

01:38:31.167 --> 01:38:33.499
What can I say?
I hooked up with my sister.

01:38:33.583 --> 01:38:35.369
You're now husband and wife.

01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:41.615
Just one thing,

01:38:41.833 --> 01:38:44.870
if anyone wants to throw rice,
even ironically,

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.992
should know that they'll get
a not very ironic beating.
