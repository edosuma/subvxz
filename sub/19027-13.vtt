<i>Tonight, it was "The Orchard Owner</i>

00:09.075 --> 00:12.408
Confess, Manuel!
Confess that you stole these apples.

00:13.713 --> 00:16.045
I was at the dance
with the other pickers.

00:16.116 --> 00:18.209
- Liar!

00:18.284 --> 00:21.014
<i>[J.D.] Frankly,</i>

You saw him do it, didn't you, Paco?

[Mexican music plays]

00:24.891 --> 00:27.257
<i>[J.D.] Mostly because</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:29.419
He hid them in his <i>pantalones.</i>

00:29.496 --> 00:34.729
He loves these apples. He makes
apples pie and apples juice with them.

00:34.801 --> 00:38.168
You can't talk. You lost your tongue
in that cider press accident.

00:38.271 --> 00:40.364
Now, back to the pickers' bunkhouse!

00:41.307 --> 00:43.673
I hate the pickers' bunkhouse.

00:43.743 --> 00:46.473
<i>[J.D.] And I hate Keith.</i>
<i>Which begs the question:</i>

00:46.546 --> 00:49.106
<i>Why do I insist on being</i>
<i>a part of their foreplay?</i>

00:50.383 --> 00:53.113
<i>I guess I needed a distraction</i>
<i>because last week,</i>

00:53.186 --> 00:55.552
<i>we all thought Mrs. Wilk was going home.</i>

00:55.655 --> 01:00.024
<i>But she got an infection, and despite</i>
<i>our best efforts, she was now gonna die.</i>

01:00.126 --> 01:03.152
<i>To make her happy,</i>
<i>we decided to take her to the beach.</i>

01:04.998 --> 01:08.092
I'm gonna miss the feel
of sand between my toes.

01:08.168 --> 01:11.331
<i>[J.D.] Still, she was sick,</i>
<i>so we couldn't go far.</i>

01:12.372 --> 01:13.805
Want me to bury you?

01:15.208 --> 01:18.109
Shut up and move the sunbrella,
will you? I'm freckling.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.237
I thought we had more sand.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.118

<i>Today's lucky listener, Ted Buckland!</i>

01:35.628 --> 01:36.856
What?

01:40.300 --> 01:42.268
Would you love a virgin daiquiri?

01:42.335 --> 01:45.862
It's a normal daiquiri.
I just let him give it to you.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.668
- [Laughs] Thanks.
- Hilarious.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.071
Cheers.

01:51.411 --> 01:54.175
You know,
I've never really been afraid of death.

01:54.247 --> 01:56.147
I used it as a motivator.

01:56.216 --> 01:59.481
When you know there's an end,
it forces you to live.

01:59.552 --> 02:02.385
It forced me in the eighth grade
to ask Peter Bucherelli

02:02.455 --> 02:04.514
to take me to the sock hop.

02:04.591 --> 02:08.083
It made me dare to travel the world.
It made me who I am.

02:08.161 --> 02:13.064
Still, now that I'm
actually staring it in the eye, I...

02:14.267 --> 02:16.167
Why am I so scared?

<i>He had a certain frankness about death.</i>

02:48.635 --> 02:51.968
Which one of you is gonna kick it?
Don't tell me. I want to guess.

02:52.038 --> 02:56.805
I'm thinking it's either you or you.
You 'cause you're hooked up to machines.

02:56.876 --> 03:00.004
Or... you have that look
of someone who's gonna die young.

03:01.381 --> 03:03.349
- I'm kidding.
- Oh...

03:03.449 --> 03:07.283
You'll live forever. Or not.
What do I know? I mean, I'm not psychic.

03:07.353 --> 03:10.015

- I think he's funny.

03:10.089 --> 03:11.386
She's delirious.

03:11.457 --> 03:15.757
Mrs. Wilk, I'm Dr. Hedrick. It sounds
clichÃ©d, but you're gonna go through

03:15.828 --> 03:17.989
"The Five Stages of Grief," which are:

03:18.064 --> 03:23.525
Denial, anger, bargaining,
depression and finally, acceptance.

03:24.437 --> 03:27.600
I assume that you two have
already entered into a conversation

03:27.707 --> 03:30.437
with Mrs. Wilk about
what dying is gonna be like.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.410
We were doing it
before you came in.

03:32.478 --> 03:34.571
Oh, I'm sorry. Then please, continue.

03:34.647 --> 03:38.139
All right, we will. Newbie... go.

03:40.186 --> 03:42.654
[Stammering] Oh, OK.
Well, well, yeah. Um...

03:45.959 --> 03:50.225
OK, death is like a journey.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.730
Uh, a journey in a boat.

03:52.799 --> 03:55.825
And, uh, then this giant light

03:55.902 --> 03:59.167
shines down on your "boat"

03:59.239 --> 04:03.403
and, uh, carries you up to the heavens.

04:03.509 --> 04:06.376
That was the ending to <i>Cocoon.</i>

04:06.446 --> 04:08.471
Take it away, Coxie.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.016
Keith, keep moving. No talking.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.514
Hey, where's my wave,
you little piece of meat?

04:15.288 --> 04:18.348
You know, Elliot,
the four of us should go out to dinner.

04:18.423 --> 04:21.587
Why are you so obsessed
about going out with other couples?

04:21.694 --> 04:25.323
Didn't you learn your lesson
last week with our neighbors?

04:27.033 --> 04:29.900
Squirrel chili. Who knew? Ha!

04:29.969 --> 04:31.869
It's really good.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.701
[Howling]

04:35.942 --> 04:37.705
- I wanna go home.
- Eat your soup.

04:37.810 --> 04:38.777
No.

04:38.878 --> 04:42.905
They're not our neighbors. They live
in the woods behind our apartment.

04:42.982 --> 04:47.282
We'd be having brunch with them Sunday
if you could have choked down the tail.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.617
Carla, I don't know.
Keith is a booty call.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.453
I make it a point
not to see him before midnight.

04:54.594 --> 04:56.960
[Ted coughing]

05:00.300 --> 05:03.827
Oh, good,
the piles are getting smaller.

05:03.903 --> 05:04.870
Good.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.940
That reminds me. Did you get
that sand out of his office?

05:08.007 --> 05:10.942
Yes, I did,
and it cut my commute in half.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.143
[Classical music plays]

05:14.213 --> 05:16.272
Good morning, loyal subjects.

05:16.349 --> 05:19.409
Enjoy your day in Janitoria.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.818
Labor until you tire
and then labor some more.

05:25.091 --> 05:26.353
Looks like rain.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.118
That could be a problem.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.096
Sir, can I have Sunday afternoon off?

05:35.201 --> 05:38.864
Well, that depends. Is Baxter's
dog run gonna hose itself down?

05:38.938 --> 05:40.769
- No.
- Actually, it is.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.537
I rigged the hose to a timer.
But I need you to clean out my gutters.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.738
But, sir,
I'm doing a bike ride for charity!

05:47.814 --> 05:51.580
Ted, the only thing I hate more
than bikes are procedural cop shows.

05:51.651 --> 05:55.587
We get it, the pedophile did it.
Be at my house at 2:30.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.283
Just once, I... [spits]

05:59.359 --> 06:03.056
Just once, I wish I could
treat Kelso like he treats us.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.990
With Kelso, you got no leverage.

06:06.065 --> 06:08.226
Leverage.

06:08.301 --> 06:09.461
Leverage?

06:09.535 --> 06:11.765
- You don't know what it means, do ya?
- No.

06:14.273 --> 06:17.367
I understand you spend most
of your time fighting death,

06:17.443 --> 06:21.345
so it's understandable
that you're made uncomfortable by this.

06:21.414 --> 06:25.180
Now, if you'd like,
I'm willing to counsel both of you.

06:25.284 --> 06:28.720
<i>[J.D.] I was tempted to take him up,</i>
<i>but then Dr. Cox said something.</i>

06:32.992 --> 06:34.755

<i>After all these years,</i>
<i>he's finally made us a team.</i>

06:38.164 --> 06:43.602
Yeah, Hedrick. If it was up to us,
we never would've even called you.

06:43.669 --> 06:46.194
We can handle death just fine.

06:46.272 --> 06:49.139
We might even be going
into private practice together.

<i>- [J.D.] Easy.</i>

06:50.543 --> 06:53.444

<i>to Jacksonville.</i>

06:56.048 --> 06:58.676
Clearly, I'm pushing some buttons here.

06:58.751 --> 07:02.710
You couldn't push my buttons if you
tried. In fact, I have no buttons.

07:02.789 --> 07:07.453
Please think of me as buttonless, all
smooth, like GI Joe's nether regions.

07:07.527 --> 07:10.360
By the by, this image
is brought to you by my son, Jack,

07:10.430 --> 07:13.661
who has been yanking pants
off toy soldiers and leaving them

07:13.733 --> 07:16.065
in provocative positions
on my nightstand.

07:16.135 --> 07:19.195
It is just disturbing enough
so that leaving the house,

07:19.272 --> 07:21.934
I'm cranky
and less able to suffer fools,

07:22.008 --> 07:24.977
which brings me back to you: The fool.

07:25.077 --> 07:27.341
I'm done suffering you, so go now.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.244
Go. Go,
before you can write a book

07:29.315 --> 07:35.254
entitled <i>Help! A Large Doctor is Beating</i>
<i>My Ass: The Lester Hedrick Story.</i>

07:37.423 --> 07:39.482
That was a mouthful.

07:39.559 --> 07:42.323
Anyway, if you need to talk,
just give me a call.

07:42.795 --> 07:47.960
He seems strangely impervious
to my threats. That annoys me.

07:48.534 --> 07:50.468
Basically, when you're in the mood,

07:50.536 --> 07:54.028
you call Keith and he comes over
and gives you 20-something nasty?

07:54.106 --> 07:55.471
Watch me.

07:56.909 --> 07:59.343
- [Beeps]
- [Clears throat]

07:59.412 --> 08:00.504
Got the machine.

08:01.013 --> 08:04.676
We're going to your place tonight.
My room smells like apple vinegar.

08:04.750 --> 08:08.811
Put clean sheets on the futon and turn
the pictures of your parents face down,

08:08.888 --> 08:13.257
except for that one of your dad
in the Navy. It helps me.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.321
How does he put up with that?

08:16.395 --> 08:18.363
Would you get my scarf
out of the car?

08:18.464 --> 08:21.126
I am making a point here, honey.
No man should...

08:21.200 --> 08:24.033
Turk, less point-making,
more scarf-getting.

08:29.075 --> 08:32.101

Oh, I tried to, Perry,
but I'm having some scooter trouble.

08:40.753 --> 08:42.982
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
Let's go.

08:48.327 --> 08:51.262
Can you believe the <i>huevos</i>
on that Hedrick?

08:51.330 --> 08:54.663
Holy cow. It's like we've never
had a patient die on us before.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.500

It has been rolling on the floor.
It will explode.

Apparently, you're not familiar
with the John Dorian three-tap method.

Three taps and the foam goes bye-bye.

09:59.865 --> 10:01.423
[Laughs] No.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.184
Tell you something I learned today.

equals cave-in.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.222
Why do you hate bikes so much, sir?

that since the car
is in your mother's name,

10:40.673 --> 10:45.838
I wouldn't be able to leave the family
forever if it weren't for your bike.

10:52.585 --> 10:54.553

<i>[J.D.] Mrs. Wilk didn't have much time,</i>

12:41.393 --> 12:45.090
<i>so either Dr. Cox or I</i>
<i>had to notify her next of kin.</i>

12:45.164 --> 12:48.133
<i>As physicians, we knew just</i>
<i>how to decide who should do it.</i>

12:48.200 --> 12:50.259
<i>First one to drop tells her.</i>

12:50.336 --> 12:51.860
Phew!

12:51.937 --> 12:54.064
Pretty strong there, Newbie.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.398
<i>[J.D.] I was not.</i>

12:56.475 --> 13:00.434
<i>But hopefully, the duct tape I used</i>
<i>to connect my prosthetic arms was.</i>

13:00.513 --> 13:02.037
Ah!

13:03.582 --> 13:05.243
Ow.

13:07.653 --> 13:11.555
Why are we doing this? I've seen people
in Mrs. Wilk's shape turn around.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.387
She could totally turn it around.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.949
Denial.

13:15.027 --> 13:18.087
Yeah, it's not uncommon
for people close to the patient

13:18.164 --> 13:20.428
to also go through
the five stages of grief.

13:20.499 --> 13:23.161
- It's not denial. She could rally.
- Totally rally.

13:23.235 --> 13:27.569
Oh, yeah. I mean, look at her.
She should be in a vitamin commercial.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.200
How would you like to be
in a broken jaw commercial?

13:30.309 --> 13:33.540
God help me, I don't care
if it does give me cancer,

13:33.612 --> 13:35.375
I just love this fake sugar.

13:36.382 --> 13:41.217
If he keeps ignoring my threats,
I'm gonna have to hit him.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.313
The good news is,
it looks like he has a soft face.

13:45.090 --> 13:48.719
- [Man] Are you done with my arms?
- Coming to ya, Mr. Johnson.

13:51.931 --> 13:54.900
So I was Keith's booty call,
whatever. It'll blow over.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.230
That's not good enough, Elliot.

13:57.303 --> 14:02.138
By letting Keith get the upper hand,
you've given Turk ideas. Look at him.

14:04.710 --> 14:09.670
Baby, I know you hate
my cool walking stick,

14:09.782 --> 14:12.307
but I got to be my own man.

14:12.384 --> 14:16.252
It's catching on. Yeah.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.723
OK, Teddy.
I got this baby flowing now.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.728
I don't know if that's good.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.823
You should sue Kelso.
You have a serious tort on your hands.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.026
Tort?

14:29.101 --> 14:31.467
Civil case. From the French <i>avoir tort.</i>

14:31.537 --> 14:33.095
Did you go to law school?

14:33.205 --> 14:36.174
No. I was Ruth Bader Ginsburg's
janitor for a while.

14:36.242 --> 14:40.611
- Ruth Bader who?
- Hey! There's my guy.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.945
Listen, I just came up to apologize
for that little fender-bender out there.

14:45.017 --> 14:49.044
So would two floor seats

14:49.121 --> 14:53.023
to the WNBA All-Star Game
just make all this ago away?

14:53.092 --> 14:55.560
Absolutely!

14:55.628 --> 14:58.461
Uh, Ted is gonna be wanting
more than that, I'm afraid.

14:58.530 --> 14:59.690
I am?

15:00.966 --> 15:02.297
I am!

15:04.970 --> 15:08.133
<i>[J.D.] Dr. Cox and I decided</i>
<i>to give Hedrick a piece of our mind.</i>

15:08.240 --> 15:11.073
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>I had lost front-seat privileges.</i>

15:11.143 --> 15:15.842
Yep, you're right. Still a little
sticky. Not yet ready for passengers.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.947
All right, Lester, we're having
this out right here, right now!

15:20.019 --> 15:21.953
Oh, for the love of God!

15:22.021 --> 15:25.047
What's this, some pansy
"get in touch with my feelings

15:25.124 --> 15:27.285
because my mommy
didn't love me" group?

15:27.359 --> 15:28.986
Yeah, is that what it is?!

15:29.061 --> 15:32.553
Actually, this is a support group
for the terminally ill.

15:32.631 --> 15:34.599
Oh, we should probably go.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.861
No, no. Please, continue.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.631
Stop bugging us.

15:38.704 --> 15:42.538
I find your particular brand
of psychobablry about as useful

15:42.608 --> 15:44.542
and about as effective as fairy dust.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.635
He's actually helped me quite a lot.

15:46.712 --> 15:48.612
Oh.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.308
Good.

15:50.382 --> 15:53.146
- Dr. Cox?
- Yeah, Newbie, what do you got?

15:53.252 --> 15:55.117
That guy looks fantastic.

15:55.187 --> 15:58.452
What do you think he's dying of,
a case of the handsomes?

15:58.524 --> 16:00.992
You know what?
To hell with you, Hedrick!

16:01.060 --> 16:05.360
Group, can you tell me what stage
of grief Dr. Cox here is going through?

16:05.431 --> 16:07.262
- [All] Anger.
- Anger, yes.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.597
You don't want to see me angry!

16:09.668 --> 16:12.796
Nor do you want to see I angry.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.543
You better hope
you don't make any mistakes.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.145
- It's awful.
- Uh...

16:33.926 --> 16:37.293
Carla's telling Elliot to ignore you
so she can regain the power.

16:37.363 --> 16:38.625
I don't really care.

16:38.697 --> 16:41.393
Well, you know,
this isn't about you, Keith.

16:41.467 --> 16:46.404
This is about men everywhere who
have been abused and bullied by women.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.440
It's about me.

16:48.540 --> 16:52.237
Now when they walk by,
you call her a different name.

16:52.311 --> 16:53.573
I won't do it.

16:53.645 --> 16:56.512
Here's how you get your power
from Keith: Ignore him.

16:56.582 --> 16:57.708
- For realsies?
- Yep.

16:58.584 --> 17:01.052
Hey, how you doing, Claire?

17:01.120 --> 17:03.213
Did you just call me Claire?

17:03.288 --> 17:05.449
No, I would never call you...

17:05.557 --> 17:07.684
- Oh, snap!
- Elliot!

17:08.794 --> 17:10.659
- That didn't sound like me.
- I know.

17:10.729 --> 17:14.494
They hear what they want to hear.
They hear what they want to hear.

17:19.104 --> 17:23.632
I'll tell you what, I'd do anything
if it meant she'd pull through this.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.142
Me too.

17:25.210 --> 17:29.374
Hey, that sounds like bargaining.
That's the third stage.

17:29.481 --> 17:31.312
By the way, I wasn't hiding there

17:31.383 --> 17:35.547
so I could pop up and say that.
I was plugging in my iPod.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.987
Oh, hang on.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.684
[Grumbles]

17:39.758 --> 17:42.693
<i>[J.D.] We weren't the only ones</i>
<i>at the bargaining stage.</i>

17:44.396 --> 17:46.296
[Chuckles]

17:49.768 --> 17:51.736
Oh!

17:55.507 --> 17:57.566
Oh!

17:57.643 --> 18:00.077
Now, let's talk, Ted.

18:00.145 --> 18:03.171
Just you and me. No lawyers.

18:06.618 --> 18:10.247
OK, I know how you can
regain control of Keith.

18:10.322 --> 18:12.882
Don't bother.
That booty call thing was fun,

18:12.991 --> 18:16.256
but I'm so sick and tired
of being a cold, emotionless bastard.

18:16.328 --> 18:20.389
Don't ever get sick and tired
of that. It is awesome being that.

18:20.466 --> 18:22.024
- We love it.
- No!

18:22.101 --> 18:23.796
Yeah, it's too much, I know.

18:23.869 --> 18:26.633
Well, you can always
get another boy toy, right?

18:26.705 --> 18:30.869
Every time you look, you're gonna be
reminded of no-strings-attached fun.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.604
That's not what I'll remember.

18:33.679 --> 18:35.840
[# Deberg <i>l</i> Jacobs: <i>Bring Me Love</i> ]

18:39.651 --> 18:43.087
I just wanted to tell you
how beautiful you look right now.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.257
That is so sweet.

18:51.096 --> 18:54.657
Oh, Elliot! You like him.

18:54.766 --> 18:57.234
<i>[J.D.] That was the moment</i>
<i>it got real for Elliot.</i>

18:57.302 --> 18:59.930
[Pager beeping]

19:01.507 --> 19:03.634
<i>And for Dr. Cox and me.</i>

19:08.280 --> 19:10.339
Should be any minute now.

19:10.415 --> 19:15.182
<i>[J.D.] We'd been there before when</i>
<i>someone died, but this felt different.</i>

19:16.255 --> 19:18.883
[Flatline tone]

19:26.331 --> 19:28.356
She's gone.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.765
[# Pearl Jam with Neil Young:
<i>Long Road]</i>

19:30.836 --> 19:33.737
<i>[J.D.] We were definitely</i>
<i>in the depression stage.</i>

19:33.805 --> 19:36.239
<i>And bless Hedrick, he didn't say it.</i>

19:36.308 --> 19:38.242
<i>All he said was...</i>

19:38.310 --> 19:41.643
She was lucky
to have you two as doctors.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.576
<i>[J.D.] Letting go is never easy.</i>

19:48.887 --> 19:52.186
<i>Whether it's letting go of</i>
<i>the leverage you had over your boss...</i>

19:52.257 --> 19:55.192
I would like the word
"maintenance" on my uni written out

19:55.260 --> 19:57.888
in tiny light bulbs.
That way, when I'm on a break,

19:57.963 --> 19:59.726
I can turn it off like a taxi.

19:59.831 --> 20:01.958
Your friend settled. It's over.

20:02.034 --> 20:07.370
I got seven Sunday afternoons

Hey.

Do you want to go for dinner tonight?
And I mean at seven, not midnight.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.481
I'd love that.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.081
<i>[J.D.] There's nothing more difficult</i>

<i>than letting go</i>
<i>of someone you cared about.</i>

20:27.459 --> 20:29.984
She was a great old gal.

- She was.
