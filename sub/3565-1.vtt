00:32.491 --> 00:34.534
Welcome back,
a cappella enthusiasts.

00:34.618 --> 00:35.868
My name is John Smith,

00:35.953 --> 00:37.120
and sitting here to my left

00:37.204 --> 00:39.372
is Gail
Abernathy-McCadden-Feinberger.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.790
Oh, this one's
gonna stick, John.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.126
Well, you saved the Jew for last.
I did. I did.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.669
You're listening to
Let's Talk-Appella,

00:44.753 --> 00:47.588
the world's premiere
downloadable a cappella podcast.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.966
We are coming to you live
from the nation's capital,

00:50.050 --> 00:51.175
where the
Barden University Bellas

00:51.260 --> 00:54.137
are about to rock
the historic Kennedy Center.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.722
Boy, these girls
have broken down

00:55.806 --> 00:57.890
every single barrier in their path,
haven't they, Gail?

00:57.975 --> 00:59.058
Absolutely, John.

00:59.143 --> 01:01.519
The first all-female group
to win a national title,

01:01.812 --> 01:03.980
three-time defending champs,
and now, here they are,

01:04.188 --> 01:07.650
performing for the President of the
United States on his birthday.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.444
Wow!
What an inspiration

01:09.528 --> 01:12.947
to girls all over the country who
are too ugly to be cheerleaders.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.535
Here's Beca Mitchell,
leader of the group.

01:59.745 --> 02:02.121
Look at these
sequins and sparkles.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.540
Oh, my! Their feet
just don't stop moving.

02:32.069 --> 02:35.780
Florencia Fuentes just earned
her green card, John.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.573
She may have to
do that backflip

02:37.658 --> 02:39.575
right back over
the fence into Mexico.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.077
I think she's Guatemalan.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.411
Oh, none of that matters.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.163
There is so much
happening on stage,

02:44.248 --> 02:46.040
I don't even know
where to look.

02:46.124 --> 02:49.919
Back in my day,
we put on our blazers and we just sang.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.163
We maybe snapped our fingers
if we were feeling frisky.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.603
Whoa!
Another surprise!

03:07.688 --> 03:10.523
An overweight girl
dangling from the ceiling.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.025
Who hasn't had that dream?
Lots of us.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.551
No!

03:38.719 --> 03:40.887
Okay, she has no underwear on.
Oh, my God.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.131
We have a commando situation.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.223
There is a commando
situation on stage!

03:44.308 --> 03:45.850
Who is on top of this?

03:45.976 --> 03:47.476
- What kind of person...
- Holy cow!

03:47.519 --> 03:49.478
Take her back up.
She's turning.
Pull her up already!

03:49.563 --> 03:51.188
She's turning.
Brace yourselves.
No.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.565
She's coming.
She's coming!

03:52.649 --> 03:55.735
Avert your eyes,
or take it all in!
Make your choice!

03:55.819 --> 03:57.153
Not the front!
Nobody wants to see the front!

03:57.237 --> 03:58.529
Oh, no!

04:01.533 --> 04:03.910
Happy birthday,
Mr. President.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.787
The Australian singer
who calls herself "Fat Amy"

04:06.872 --> 04:08.915
gave the President a
birthday gift from down under

04:08.999 --> 04:10.249
during last night's celebration

04:10.334 --> 04:12.585
held at the historic
Kennedy Center.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.587
In case you're wondering what I mean by
"down under," Chip,

04:14.671 --> 04:16.172
I'm talking about her.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.507
She showed her
to the President.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.681
All eyes were on the a cappella singers,
the Barden Bellas.

04:25.766 --> 04:29.060
...three-time defending
a cappella national champions,

04:29.144 --> 04:31.854
which is a real thing,
apparently.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.607
Although authorities have
ruled out terrorism as a motive,

04:34.691 --> 04:37.610
the Bellas claim the mishap
was merely an accident

04:37.694 --> 04:39.028
and issued an apology.

04:39.196 --> 04:44.075
I am deeply sorry for the
upset that I have caused.

04:44.159 --> 04:48.287
I feel that I have already
received punishment enough

04:48.372 --> 04:50.623
in the form of silk burn.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.249
Exhibit C.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.334
No, no, no!

04:53.377 --> 04:54.377
It's filth.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.462
Women who sing
are just another example

04:56.546 --> 04:58.839
of cultural decay,
due to loose morals.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.174
Not wearing underwear

05:00.300 --> 05:01.968
seems kind of intentional to me.
Mmm.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.512
Yeah, you either
choose to wear underwear,
or you don't wear underwear.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.180
It's a choice
I make every day.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.766
You know, until today,
I thought singing a cappella

05:08.850 --> 05:11.060
was the most embarrassing
thing you could do.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.937
Normally,
that group is on point,

05:13.021 --> 05:14.647
and last night,
they were off-point,

05:14.731 --> 05:16.065
off-key,
and then on the floor.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.233
It's a national disgrace.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.776
Yeah, but I'd
rather be in that

05:18.860 --> 05:20.236
limo ride home
with the President.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.880
Cut to the real President,
he'd be like,

05:21.947 --> 05:23.948
"That
was off the hook!"

05:51.768 --> 05:53.644
Chloe, chill out.
It was a mistake.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.354
They're not gonna
burn us for witchcraft.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.523
No, but the National
A Cappella Association

05:57.607 --> 05:59.025
is in there talking
to the dean about us,

05:59.109 --> 06:00.429
and who knows
what's gonna happen?

06:00.527 --> 06:02.028
We won three championships.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.952
Whatever happens in there,
we're gonna be fine.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.615
Maybe it's time to
think about other stuff.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.034
What other stuff?

06:08.118 --> 06:10.286
You know,
school, jobs, life.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.455
This group is my life.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.540
I've intentionally failed
Russian Lit three times

06:14.624 --> 06:16.000
so I could be a Bella.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.794
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to us.
Ever.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.506
You know,
before coming to Barden,

06:22.591 --> 06:24.717
I had diarrhea
for seven years.

06:26.136 --> 06:29.138
But yes, this is terrible.

06:29.306 --> 06:32.016
The dean is ready
for you tramps.

06:32.642 --> 06:33.642
Oh, jeez.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.519
Ladies,

06:35.687 --> 06:37.438
you have dragged
the good name

06:37.522 --> 06:40.232
of Barden University
into the gutter.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.485
And you've really
upset these people

06:42.986 --> 06:44.570
whose names
I've already forgotten.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.990
Your little southern exposure in
front of our Commander-in-Chief

06:48.075 --> 06:51.911
has irreparably damaged the
entire institution of a cappella.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.079
Just blew it up.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.081
Funding is drying up,
sponsors are pulling out.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.958
Mmm-hmm. Unfortunately,
an example must be made.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.252
It is the decision
of this governing body

07:00.337 --> 07:03.380
that the Bellas
are hereby suspended

07:03.507 --> 07:05.267
from competing at the collegiate level.
What?

07:05.342 --> 07:06.967
The terms of your suspension

07:07.052 --> 07:08.594
are laid out
in this document.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.971
I'm sorry,
but it's over.
Hi.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.765
Okay, can we be reasonable?

07:12.849 --> 07:15.267
Fat Amy apologized.
This was an accident.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.477
Was it?

07:16.561 --> 07:18.854
You're taking us off
of our victory tour?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.482
Who's gonna sing the national
anthem at the Puppy Bowl?

07:21.566 --> 07:24.443
You're being replaced
by the European champions.

07:24.528 --> 07:27.113
A German group
of total professionals.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.157
In other words, they're gonna
keep their pants on.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.617
So we can't defend our title
and we can't tour?

07:31.701 --> 07:33.410
And you can't
hold any auditions.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.413
We don't need your ranks
to grow like a fungus.

07:36.498 --> 07:37.623
Oh, so that's it, then?

07:37.707 --> 07:39.667
So, basically,
the Bellas are over?

07:39.751 --> 07:40.751
Look, ladies,

07:40.836 --> 07:44.547
I'm sorry that this disciplinary
action has shocked you.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.549
Especially since
you're all seniors.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.675
But the truth is,

07:47.759 --> 07:48.968
you're just women.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.261
No.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.263
And you'll all be pregnant soon.
Mmm.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.225
Mom, I'm late.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.561
It's orientation.
You gotta let me go.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.312
Oh, I can't.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.438
I just can't do it.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.523
Mom, you can do it.

08:02.566 --> 08:05.526
My only daughter,
leaving the nest.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.405
If you leave me now

08:09.906 --> 08:14.493
You'll take away
the biggest part of me

08:14.578 --> 08:16.078
Mom.
You want me to stop?

08:16.163 --> 08:17.454
Or I could keep singing!

08:17.539 --> 08:18.831
No, I don't know
how I'm gonna get by

08:18.915 --> 08:21.250
without your
spontaneous singing.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.669
Oh, honey, you're gonna
love this place.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.838
Just promise you'll call.

08:26.089 --> 08:29.216
Oh, and, honey,
don't be afraid to express yourself.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.886
And not with those weird buttons
they wear in their earlobes.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.596
Unless you're gonna get a job...
Mom, slow down.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.472
I'm not gonna do
anything crazy.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.876
I'm just gonna write my songs
and join an a cappella group.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.436
Not just
any a cappella group.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.522
The Bellas are an institution.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.050
My days as a Bella
were the best...

08:45.108 --> 08:46.650
Best days of your life.

08:46.735 --> 08:49.361
I know.
And I can't wait to be one.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.822
Unless they don't
take me, Mom.

08:51.907 --> 08:54.074
Oh, no, honey,
they're gonna take you.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.619
Thanks to me,
you were born into it.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.537
And then I'm gonna
be your mother...

08:58.830 --> 09:01.290
And your sister

09:01.458 --> 09:02.875
Gross. Okay.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.796
All right,
the next phase of my life

09:09.341 --> 09:10.633
begins.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.800
Hold on.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.553
There is nothing in here that
strips us of our national title.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.388
And if we're still
reigning champs,

09:16.473 --> 09:18.891
then we are automatically
invited to represent America

09:18.975 --> 09:20.434
at the World Championships
this spring.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.062
Ah, yes, the World
Championships of A Cappella,

09:23.146 --> 09:24.480
where, every four years,

09:24.564 --> 09:27.608
groups from around the globe
compete for world domination.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.277
I'm sorry. I just feel like I always
have to be on, you know.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.737
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, look, ladies,

09:31.821 --> 09:35.241
we can't stop you from going
to the Worlds competition.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.909
It's not gonna
help your case here.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.035
Not at all.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.245
What if we win it?

09:39.329 --> 09:40.329
What if you win it?

09:40.664 --> 09:43.916
Like, you...

09:44.000 --> 09:46.001
You out-perform
the other groups?

09:49.673 --> 09:53.092
How do you fit such big
dreams in such a small body?

09:53.176 --> 09:54.677
What if you win it?

09:59.015 --> 10:00.099
Never.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.101
What if you win it?

10:02.227 --> 10:04.812
Yeah. If we win,
will you reinstate us?
Sure.

10:04.896 --> 10:07.898
But no American team
has ever won.

10:07.983 --> 10:10.317
That's because they hate us.

10:10.402 --> 10:11.777
The whole world.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.112
The whole world hates us.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.405
Hate us.

10:14.572 --> 10:14.613
Hello, fresh-persons!

10:14.614 --> 10:16.865
Hello, fresh-persons!

10:17.033 --> 10:19.535
Welcome to Barden University!

10:24.582 --> 10:26.166
Okay! The Barden Knight.

10:26.251 --> 10:29.128
Okay, get off the stage.
No one cares about you.
All right.

10:29.212 --> 10:32.756
You have made a great choice,
and a cheap one.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.551
Yay, Barden!

10:35.719 --> 10:39.054
We have a very special
performance for you guys today.

10:39.222 --> 10:42.391
The pride and joy
of Barden University,

10:42.559 --> 10:44.476
the Treblamakers!

10:46.271 --> 10:48.480
Thank you!
Thank you, thank you.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.649
We are the Treblemakers.

10:50.734 --> 10:53.027
I'm Jesse,
and this is a cappella.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.778
Let's do this!

10:54.863 --> 10:56.739
Hey yo, Trebles!

11:54.964 --> 11:56.048
Someone drop some bass.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.052
Now I need some baritone.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.847
All right!

12:45.515 --> 12:47.683
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

12:47.851 --> 12:49.518
Chloe,
don't blame yourself.
Oh, my God!

12:49.686 --> 12:51.854
You're a ginger.
That's punishment enough.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.606
This is not all your fault.
This is on all of us.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.859
So, if we don't win the Worlds,
then what are we?

12:56.943 --> 12:59.111
Just a bunch of girls
that hang out?

12:59.195 --> 13:00.487
What's wrong with that?

13:00.530 --> 13:02.573
If we don't win,
the Bellas are over.

13:02.657 --> 13:05.534
This is the biggest challenge
that any of us have ever faced.

13:05.618 --> 13:10.622
When I was nine years old,
my brother tried to sell
me for a chicken, so...

13:10.707 --> 13:12.166
Well, I will do
whoever it takes

13:12.250 --> 13:13.625
in order for us
to get back to the top.

13:13.710 --> 13:14.870
You mean "whatever" it takes.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.211
Yeah, I'll do that, too.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.714
That's great news. Yes.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.468
No, I can start Monday.
I would be stoked to start on...

13:22.552 --> 13:24.720
Sorry, I don't say "stoked."
I don't say stuff like that.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.097
I'm, like, I'm pretty cool.
You're gonna like me.

13:27.599 --> 13:28.682
That was bad, too.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.143
We need to attack
this problem head-on.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.313
I want 100% commitment
and laser focus, right?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.732
Great! I will see you Monday.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.234
Beca out!

13:40.737 --> 13:42.654
- Beca.
- Yeah.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.239
Hey, ladies.
Wanna come to a party?

13:44.491 --> 13:47.159
It's a tiki party.
You guys don't even have to wear shoes.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.619
It's the best kind of party.

13:49.579 --> 13:50.871
Here you go.
Sure.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.832
Hey, great job, Trebles.
You guys killed it.

13:53.917 --> 13:54.917
Oh, thank you.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.835
You like a cappella?
Oh, yeah.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.338
I've got my heart set
on being a Bella.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.381
It's actually at the very top
of all my dream boards.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.674
Did I hear
mention of dreams?

14:02.759 --> 14:05.302
Hi. Benjamin Applebaum
at your service. Hello.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.764
I just have to say,
you are so spirited. I...

14:08.932 --> 14:11.099
I just wanna put you in a box
and saw you in half.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.684
For magic.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.437
As a part of a trick.
He does magic.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.981
Right.
It's only weird
if you don't embrace it.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.566
Dude, explain yourself.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.891
I'll be honest,
I completely blacked out.
How'd I do, man?

14:21.945 --> 14:23.612
Honestly?
I've seen you do worse.

14:23.696 --> 14:24.780
Awesome.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.954
It's been months and
we're still getting hate mail?

14:32.121 --> 14:33.121
Sucks!

14:33.164 --> 14:34.957
"For your hairy situation"?

14:36.334 --> 14:37.376
Oh.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.379
Okay,
we are officially registered.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.756
Update your passports, ladies,
because we are going

14:42.840 --> 14:47.761
to the very sunny,
very beautiful, Copenhagen!

14:47.929 --> 14:49.721
Yeah! Nice!
Yes!

14:50.348 --> 14:51.348
Oh.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.225
Where is that?

14:53.309 --> 14:54.977
I don't know. I failed Maps.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.104
It looks like the competition
has been dominated

14:57.188 --> 15:00.232
by that stupid German group
that took over our tour.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.484
- You mean "stole" our tour.
- Word.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.361
We need to scout
those Deutsche-bags.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.445
Yes.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.239
But how good can they be?

15:07.323 --> 15:09.950
Germany hasn't produced a
good singer since David Hasselhoff.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.577
We're gonna crush them.

15:11.661 --> 15:12.786
And when we do,

15:12.870 --> 15:14.121
we can stick it
to these chumps

15:14.205 --> 15:16.331
who send us all
this hate mail, like,

15:16.416 --> 15:18.458
"Sonia Sotomayor."

15:19.877 --> 15:21.378
Judgy bitch.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.588
The Bellas are back!

15:22.839 --> 15:25.424
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Yeah! We're back.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.676
Has anyone talked
to Beca today?

15:27.760 --> 15:28.760
So?

15:28.845 --> 15:29.886
Any first-day jitters?

15:30.346 --> 15:31.680
No, no. You know,
I'm just gonna

15:31.764 --> 15:33.473
be moody and distant.
Artists love that.

15:33.558 --> 15:34.558
I know I love that.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.310
Here you go.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.519
Okay.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.439
Dude, why do I
feel so guilty?

15:40.523 --> 15:42.003
I've given a lot to
the Bellas, right?

15:42.066 --> 15:43.442
It's, like,
three years of my life.

15:43.526 --> 15:46.820
Yeah, Bec,
you should not feel guilty
at all about taking your shot.

15:46.904 --> 15:47.988
This is a big deal, right?

15:48.072 --> 15:50.198
Yes, it's a very big deal.
Okay.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.701
Go.
All right.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.372
Nothing's gonna stop my girl!

15:57.540 --> 15:58.749
I don't know him!

15:58.833 --> 16:00.125
Becs in effects, y'all!

16:00.209 --> 16:01.710
You can go!

16:06.966 --> 16:08.050
Are you ready, or...

16:37.914 --> 16:39.581
Okay, everybody, huddle up.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.501
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Get up!

16:42.585 --> 16:44.670
Come on!
To the table, please!
To the table!

16:44.754 --> 16:47.506
Last one at this table has
to help Frank watch YouTube videos

16:47.590 --> 16:49.132
to find
the next Justin Bieber.

16:49.217 --> 16:50.842
Hey, so, I'm turning 25
next week,

16:50.927 --> 16:52.928
if anybody wants to
get some drinks, celebrate.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.138
Frank, buddy, less talk.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.848
Thank you so much.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.017
Okay, my people, check it out.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.478
That...

17:02.563 --> 17:05.773
This... Dax, the tech guy.
Did you call the tech guy?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.192
Yeah, I talked to him.

17:07.276 --> 17:10.444
Do you understand that
everything else in my life works?

17:10.863 --> 17:11.863
Uh-huh.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.656
So, I just need everything here to work,
too, okay?

17:13.782 --> 17:15.826
Well, he said he was gonna call me back.
Oh, my God.

17:16.786 --> 17:17.906
You want me to call him now?

17:17.954 --> 17:19.871
Don't do it now.

17:20.248 --> 17:21.248
Okay.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.790
There we go.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.877
That is the Lion himself.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.381
That is the legendary
Snoop D-O-Double-G

17:29.465 --> 17:32.134
singing White Christmas at a
tree-lighting ceremony in Moscow.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.261
And he was so moved
by the power of music

17:34.345 --> 17:36.054
to unite the world
or some shit,

17:36.139 --> 17:38.515
that now he wants to drop
his own cool Christmas album.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.809
And because I sleep
on a bed of Grammys,

17:40.977 --> 17:43.353
he has decided to hire me
to produce it. Now...

17:43.438 --> 17:45.439
But Snoop Dogg already dropped
a Christmas album.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.566
If you had listened to
the album like I did,

17:47.650 --> 17:51.778
stranded in the air with T.I.
on a golden hang glider,

17:51.863 --> 17:55.198
then you would have known that
none of the songs were the classics.

17:55.366 --> 17:58.160
I've had to listen to that album on
two separate occasions.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.870
Hang glider with T.I.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.497
and also a rocket ship
that Eminem has built.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.458
It doesn't go anywhere,

18:04.542 --> 18:06.460
but he's got dreams
for it, okay?

18:06.544 --> 18:09.171
So I need you to
close your mouth.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.173
Herein lies the problem,
everybody.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.301
Last time I checked,
there are over a million Christmas albums

18:14.385 --> 18:16.928
with the same
10 damn songs on them.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.764
So, guys,
I'm telling you, man,

18:18.931 --> 18:21.016
I need all hands
on deck right now

18:21.100 --> 18:24.186
to come up with ideas on
how to make this one stand out.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.729
Okay? You got it?

18:26.230 --> 18:27.898
Fire when ready.
I want to hear ideas.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.691
Anything.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.526
Anybody.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.652
Anybody right now
would be great.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.279
Anybody to talk...
What if we got those dogs...

18:34.363 --> 18:35.822
Anybody but you.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.909
What if we got those dogs that bark
Jingle Bells to back him up?

18:38.993 --> 18:40.619
And let me, let me,
let me guess, let me guess.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.914
You want those dogs to back
him up because he's "Snoop Dogg"?

18:43.998 --> 18:44.998
Yeah!

18:45.041 --> 18:46.958
That is a really great example

18:47.043 --> 18:48.794
of a horrible idea.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.630
Take a lap.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.508
What?
Take a lap.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.009
But I'm wearing skinny jeans.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.093
I don't care.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.428
Go. Go.

18:58.513 --> 18:59.721
Let's go.
I wanna see knees up.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.890
Knees up, please.

19:03.226 --> 19:04.906
Guys, I should give you
a little more time.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.895
A minute. You got
one minute. 60 seconds.

19:06.979 --> 19:10.524
My time is like a toddler in a tiara, okay?
Precious and short.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.485
I need really great ideas.
Snoop is coming!

19:26.791 --> 19:29.668
Oh. Sorry, my boobs are all crazy.
I was just jumping.

19:29.752 --> 19:33.046
I just came from auditions.
You guys weren't there.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.006
I was hoping for the chance
to sing for you.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.884
No, can't help you.
We're not allowed to take anyone else new.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.261
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait!

19:39.345 --> 19:40.971
I'm a Junk!

19:41.055 --> 19:42.472
What'd you say
about your junk?

19:44.100 --> 19:45.642
I'm Emily Junk.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.686
I know, it's weird.
It's my mom's last name.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.521
My dad's last name
is Hardon, so...

19:51.357 --> 19:52.357
Um...

19:54.485 --> 19:55.777
I'm a Legacy.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.320
Junk. Junk.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.114
My mom was a Bella.

19:59.282 --> 20:01.366
Your mother is Katherine Junk?

20:01.450 --> 20:02.450
Who?

20:02.535 --> 20:05.161
Only the top bitch
of the 1981 Bellas.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.455
She pioneered
the syncopated booty shake.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.958
And word is she has
a five-octave vocal range.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.126
Yep, still does.

20:11.377 --> 20:14.212
You do not want to hear that
woman doing it with my dad. Whew.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.172
What an odd thing to say.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.257
True.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.634
If a Legacy wants to audition,
we have to let her.

20:19.844 --> 20:20.844
Okay, um...

20:23.472 --> 20:24.890
Show us what you got.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.642
Right now? Right here?
Right here, right now.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.019
Yeah.

20:29.478 --> 20:33.398
Okay, um, I'd like to perform
an original song that I've been working on.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.859
I'm not quite finished
with it though,

20:36.319 --> 20:37.819
so let's not be
dicks about it.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.614
Sorry, that was crass,
wasn't it?

20:40.698 --> 20:42.407
Fat Amy,
you have a lovely vagina.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.367
Thank you. Proceed.

20:46.829 --> 20:50.999
When tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own

20:51.167 --> 20:55.253
Feeling frightened of
the things that I don't know

20:55.504 --> 20:59.341
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes

20:59.592 --> 21:03.511
When tomorrow comes

21:03.679 --> 21:07.098
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky

21:07.266 --> 21:08.767
Darkness all around...

21:08.851 --> 21:11.186
No. That one, I'm not... I'm still
kind of tinkering with that verse.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.521
So it's not... Nothing's
really completely set.

21:13.856 --> 21:16.566
I got all I need
when I got you and I

21:16.734 --> 21:19.861
'Cause I look around me
and see a sweet life

21:20.029 --> 21:22.739
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight

21:22.907 --> 21:26.368
You're getting me, getting me
through the night

21:30.206 --> 21:34.793
You are my flashlight

21:37.421 --> 21:39.631
Would you excuse us
for just one second?

21:41.550 --> 21:43.927
She's pretty good.
Can't we take her?

21:44.011 --> 21:46.721
What do you expect us to say?
She's standing right there.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.642
She's definitely not a soloist.
No.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.728
Technically, she came to us,
so really we're not breaking any rules.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.271
Yeah,
it's the perfect loophole.

21:55.356 --> 21:57.983
You know, it's always good
to have an extra body.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.527
Just in case one of us
gets kidnapped for ransom,

22:00.611 --> 22:02.153
is thrown into
a shipping container,

22:02.238 --> 22:05.198
and is made to eat
only leaves and gas receipts.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.492
Mmm, I agree.
We need new blood.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.911
I don't think we should
decide anything without Beca.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.288
I keep a penny
under my tongue.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.083
Did anyone else think
it was creepy

22:15.167 --> 22:17.168
that she never really opened
her eyes the whole time?

22:17.253 --> 22:19.087
Again, we're talking about her

22:19.171 --> 22:20.922
and she's standing right there.
Oh, yeah.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.340
But if we're
gonna talk negatives,

22:22.425 --> 22:24.134
let's start with
the giraffe legs.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.678
Okay, let's take a vote on it.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.322
Anyone who wants her in,
sing a G-sharp.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.723
Anyone who doesn't,
sing an E-flat.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.599
Okay.
One, two...

22:39.859 --> 22:41.109
I like your shirt.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.363
Welcome to the Bellas!

22:45.448 --> 22:48.533
O-M-a-ca-G! Whoo!

22:49.618 --> 22:51.661
Oh. Stop, girl, stop.
Yeah, stop, stop it.

22:51.746 --> 22:53.288
- Girl, stop.
- Sorry.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.041
So, when does
initiation start?

22:56.125 --> 22:58.293
Tell you what,
I'll go back to my dorm
and pretend to be surprised

22:58.377 --> 22:59.502
when you throw
the hood over my head

22:59.587 --> 23:00.628
and make me
solve a Rubik's Cube

23:00.713 --> 23:02.297
while sucking vodka
from a maxi pad.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.049
That's what
my mom said happened.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.133
Mmm, no can do.

23:05.176 --> 23:06.426
Well, look around.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.971
We don't exactly have
a maxi pad to spare, so...

23:10.056 --> 23:13.224
All right,
grab your guts, ladies!
It's party time!

23:13.309 --> 23:15.810
We've got tickets to Copenhagen
and a brand new Bella!

23:18.314 --> 23:19.773
Let's go!
All right.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.611
- Should I...
- Come on, girl!

23:24.695 --> 23:26.154
I'm gonna just
leave my bag here.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.490
Let's go get
into treble!

23:28.657 --> 23:30.325
Has this bush
always been here?

23:30.409 --> 23:31.493
Oh! Watch this.

23:31.577 --> 23:32.777
You know
there's a gate, right?

23:37.291 --> 23:38.291
Wow.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.335
My first college party.

23:40.503 --> 23:43.004
Yeah, well, this isn't
just any college party.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.757
This is a cappella only!
Yeah.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.843
So, get prepared to meet
a lot of sexually confused men.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.387
Bellas!
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

23:51.472 --> 23:54.390
Jesse! Where is Beca? I thought she
was gonna be with you tonight.

23:54.475 --> 23:55.475
I thought she was with you.

23:55.559 --> 23:56.893
I thought she was with you.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.731
Hey! Benji, right?

24:05.528 --> 24:08.446
Those aren't...
Okay, those aren't words.

24:11.325 --> 24:12.909
I'm sorry?

24:14.078 --> 24:15.203
...the movies?

24:15.371 --> 24:16.538
Are you asking me out?

24:18.040 --> 24:19.040
Yes.
Yeah?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.251
Oh.
That's so sweet.

24:22.211 --> 24:23.811
It's just, my...
It's my first day. Um...

24:24.213 --> 24:26.589
I wasn't really planning on
rushing in on anything.

24:40.437 --> 24:43.064
Hey! Oh.
Hey! You made it!

24:43.149 --> 24:45.900
Yeah, I couldn't miss
our last Hood Night party.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.360
Oh.
So?

24:47.903 --> 24:49.487
How was the internship?

24:49.572 --> 24:51.990
Eye-opening.
Yeah, they do not mess around.

24:52.074 --> 24:53.908
Hey, Chloe asked
where you were.

24:54.410 --> 24:55.535
Why didn't you tell her?

24:55.744 --> 24:57.245
Oh. She's just...

24:58.122 --> 24:59.414
She's locked into
the Worlds right now

24:59.498 --> 25:00.707
and I'm looking
for the right time.

25:00.791 --> 25:01.916
I'll tell her.

25:02.626 --> 25:03.960
Bumper's back!

25:04.253 --> 25:05.253
Whoo!

25:05.796 --> 25:07.046
Campus security!

25:07.131 --> 25:09.257
Bumper! Bumper!

25:09.341 --> 25:11.259
Fat Amy's back!

25:11.343 --> 25:13.887
'Cause I never left
'cause I'm still here.

25:13.971 --> 25:17.599
Whoo! But I'm back, so it's a big
deal because I've arrived again!

25:19.143 --> 25:21.477
You know, for someone
who left school years ago,

25:21.562 --> 25:23.146
you're harder to
shake than mono.

25:24.148 --> 25:27.275
I've got some
pretty big news.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.359
What?

25:28.444 --> 25:32.071
I have been hand-plucked
to be put on a waiting list

25:32.156 --> 25:37.035
to be put on a very well-known
TV singing competition.

25:37.119 --> 25:38.119
Really?
Yep.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.284
I know
what you're thinking.

25:39.330 --> 25:40.413
"Oh, Bumper.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.999
"You shut your face
and kiss me, Bumper."

25:43.083 --> 25:44.209
No.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.419
"Bumper, please,
just shut your trap."

25:46.503 --> 25:47.795
That is not how I talk.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.006
You talk exactly like this.
Do not.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.132
Yes, you do.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.134
I don't.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.345
So shut up.
You shut up.

26:06.815 --> 26:07.899
Hi!

26:07.983 --> 26:08.983
Hi.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.152
I am so excited
to meet the woman

26:11.237 --> 26:13.613
who single-handedly
created the Bella sound.

26:13.697 --> 26:14.822
We're sisters!

26:14.990 --> 26:16.366
I can't believe
we're sisters!

26:16.909 --> 26:17.951
Oh! Yeah, hi!
Hi!

26:18.035 --> 26:19.494
Chloe texted me
we added a Legacy.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.995
I didn't even know
that was a thing.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.067
Shh.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.790
Remind me again why
we are at a car show.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.459
We're here for one reason
and one reason only.

27:08.544 --> 27:09.752
To scout the competition.

27:09.837 --> 27:11.212
It's totally gonna
help us win the Worlds

27:11.297 --> 27:12.588
if we know
what we're up against.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.382
All right.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.676
Now, where are
those tour thieves?

27:16.760 --> 27:17.760
Stacie!

27:18.721 --> 27:19.804
Keep it in your pants, maybe.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.389
Stacie!
What?

27:23.100 --> 27:24.559
What the...

27:25.227 --> 27:27.312
This all should
have been ours!

27:27.730 --> 27:29.564
I hate these Germans.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.984
Holy a-ca-mole!

27:33.444 --> 27:36.321
Okay, the cars moved.
Nothing else happened yet.

27:36.405 --> 27:39.949
But they're moving backwards.
With ghosts driving them.

27:42.745 --> 27:46.414
We are Das Sound Machine.

27:46.498 --> 27:51.919
A German collective, operating in
concert to create sonic mastery.

27:52.004 --> 27:55.840
What better way to appreciate
automotive perfection?

29:02.157 --> 29:03.157
Man, they massive!

29:03.200 --> 29:05.159
How are we gonna compete
with a group that size?

29:05.244 --> 29:06.619
They're so
freakin' in sync.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.534
Do we clap?

29:46.618 --> 29:47.618
Do we clap? Do we clap?

29:47.703 --> 29:48.703
Politely clap.

29:57.129 --> 30:00.381
Barden Bellas.
You came here to see us?

30:00.883 --> 30:04.719
Is it because you are...
What do the American kids say, "Jelly"?

30:05.053 --> 30:07.221
We are so not "jelly."

30:07.389 --> 30:10.725
We should really thank you for
making this tour a reality,

30:10.809 --> 30:13.102
you know, with your
bumbling ineptitude.

30:13.270 --> 30:15.563
We should send them something.
Fruit basket?

30:15.647 --> 30:16.856
Yum, yum.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.400
Or would you prefer
mini-muffins?

30:19.485 --> 30:21.819
Okay, we didn't come here
to start something with you guys.

30:21.904 --> 30:23.696
We just wanted to
check you out before the Worlds,

30:23.780 --> 30:25.156
where we're gonna
kick your ass.

30:25.574 --> 30:27.116
What?
That's right.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.076
You?

30:29.286 --> 30:31.329
You are the kicker of ass?

30:32.247 --> 30:33.331
Yeah.

30:33.624 --> 30:35.333
You are so tiny.

30:35.626 --> 30:36.626
Like an elf.

30:36.752 --> 30:39.295
Or is it a fairy? Sprite?

30:40.964 --> 30:41.964
"Troll."

30:42.049 --> 30:44.133
That's it.
You are like a troll.

30:44.801 --> 30:45.801
You

30:46.094 --> 30:48.638
are physically flawless.

30:48.722 --> 30:49.722
Thank you.

30:49.765 --> 30:51.974
But it doesn't mean
I like you.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.686
We are not scared
about the Worlds,

30:55.771 --> 30:58.439
because when the Bellas hit the stage,
we are gonna blow minds.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.524
With what?

30:59.608 --> 31:02.318
More of Flabby Abby's
baby chute?

31:02.402 --> 31:03.569
That's not my name.

31:03.654 --> 31:04.779
I don't know your name.

31:04.863 --> 31:05.863
Could be anything.

31:05.948 --> 31:09.700
Obese Denise,
Inflexible Tina, Lazy Susan.

31:10.160 --> 31:15.206
Mein name ist Fat Amy,
und I eat krauts like you for lunch.

31:15.290 --> 31:19.377
Your team is like a...
How do you say that?
A heated mess.

31:19.461 --> 31:22.547
You know, a mess where
heat is applied to it,

31:22.631 --> 31:26.384
so what once was a little
messy is now even messier.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.136
Darlings,
please take my advice.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.055
Don't try to beat us.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.390
You can't.

31:32.474 --> 31:33.766
We're the best.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.310
And now I really
must go rest my neck.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.938
It is sore from
looking down on you.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.022
Okay,

31:40.399 --> 31:43.067
just because you're making me
very sexually confused,

31:43.151 --> 31:45.152
does not mean that
you are intimidating.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.988
We have nothing to lose.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.073
We have literally nothing!
Okay.

31:49.157 --> 31:51.075
A-ca wiedersehen, bitches!

31:51.159 --> 31:53.744
Oh, what is happening?
I am using my hands so much.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.746
All right, ladies,
focus up.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.748
We need to beat
those German dummkopfs.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.250
- Yes!
- Yeah.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.377
Okay, we're gonna beat DSM
at their own game.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.045
Do what they do, just better.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.047
And we're about to do
a full skills assessment

32:05.132 --> 32:07.091
to blow out our
choreography to match.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.595
But the important thing
is that we have fun, right?

32:11.346 --> 32:13.598
Uh, Legacy, don't take
this the wrong way,

32:13.682 --> 32:15.474
but you're
the dumbest person alive.

32:27.362 --> 32:28.613
And you're a cat!

32:29.865 --> 32:31.115
And one...

32:31.283 --> 32:33.284
Okay, Lilly,
that's really scaring me.

32:37.831 --> 32:39.707
That just looks weird.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.542
People are not birds.

32:44.046 --> 32:47.006
Cartwheel. And roll!
Amy, that wasn't a roll.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.057
Again.

33:09.905 --> 33:12.531
Is it weird that we never
got around to singing today?

33:13.325 --> 33:15.242
Uh, well, it's kind of
hard to start singing

33:15.327 --> 33:17.161
without arrangements,
and that's on me.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.621
So thank you for reminding me.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.289
Yeah, Bec,
we're gonna need that ASAP

33:20.374 --> 33:21.916
so we can start nailing down
our choreography.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.668
Right on top of that, Chlo.
Awes!

33:23.752 --> 33:24.752
Yeah, awes.

33:25.379 --> 33:26.837
So I just wanted
to let you know

33:26.922 --> 33:28.255
that I've been
working really hard

33:28.340 --> 33:30.800
on, you know,
calming my nerves
and keeping my eyes open.

33:30.884 --> 33:33.344
I was wondering if you could
give me some pointers, maybe.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.387
And, you know,
with the singing...

33:34.471 --> 33:36.722
I don't know exactly where you're
gonna put me in the songs, but I...

33:36.807 --> 33:39.642
I don't mean to be rude.
I just have somewhere that I need to be.

33:39.851 --> 33:40.851
Um...

33:40.936 --> 33:42.019
You did great today.

33:42.104 --> 33:43.104
Thanks.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.754
Wait, hold up.
Just hold up for a second.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.214
"Wait, hold up"?

34:10.382 --> 34:12.702
Man, I sound awesome right now.
What are you talking about?

34:13.092 --> 34:15.094
Nah! It's not you,
it's a tech thing.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.469
So just
you go ahead and take five.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.472
It better be a tech thing,

34:18.639 --> 34:22.268
'cause the way I sound in my eardrums,
this is immaculate, man.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.858
This song, there's nothing,
nothing special about it yet.

34:28.942 --> 34:30.525
Do you know what I mean?

34:30.944 --> 34:32.194
Any ideas? Because I...

34:32.279 --> 34:33.446
All right, um, hear me out.

34:33.530 --> 34:34.530
Please, Dax. Please...

34:34.614 --> 34:37.867
We could remove
the sleigh bells

34:37.951 --> 34:40.494
and put in kalimba.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.664
You know, the finger thing.

34:43.748 --> 34:47.460
I know what a kalimba does.
I know how it's operated, okay?

34:48.085 --> 34:49.462
Kalimba...
Don't say it again.

34:49.670 --> 34:52.255
Go in the corner.
Go eat your lunch in the corner.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.425
But what am I gonna
do with my sriracha?

34:54.509 --> 34:56.092
Say one more hipster thing,

34:56.178 --> 34:58.554
and I'm gonna shove you
in your vintage bassoon case.

34:58.638 --> 34:59.638
Okay?

35:01.808 --> 35:02.808
Turn.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.811
Aim higher, people. Okay?

35:05.979 --> 35:08.731
And be very careful
what you pitch to me next.

35:08.815 --> 35:11.692
Um, just have him
sing it again, the same way.

35:12.652 --> 35:13.694
Who are you?

35:14.780 --> 35:17.323
Nobody. Literally nobody.
I just had a thought.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.533
No, okay, okay.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.035
Sure.

35:21.369 --> 35:22.620
Nobody else has an idea.

35:24.414 --> 35:27.792
Let's, uh, do it
exactly the same way.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.210
Again.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.212
Will do, nephew.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.284
Or it can be something different.
It can...

36:43.368 --> 36:44.618
Okay.

36:44.703 --> 36:45.953
That was amazing, Snoop.

36:46.121 --> 36:47.663
Thank you so very much.

36:47.747 --> 36:49.123
You can take
a small break, man.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.667
Everything, perfection.
Perfection.

36:52.085 --> 36:53.794
Groovy like a drive-in movie.

36:55.463 --> 36:56.714
You can sing.

36:57.799 --> 37:01.969
Um, yeah, I'm a three-time
collegiate a cappella champion, so...

37:02.888 --> 37:04.722
We're both huge successes
in our fields.

37:04.806 --> 37:05.848
Yeah.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.474
Yeah, let's say that.

37:07.809 --> 37:09.143
Uh, what do you do here?

37:10.270 --> 37:12.897
I just get coffee
and burritos and stuff.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.482
I wanna produce music.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.401
Dax? Can you do me a favor?

37:17.485 --> 37:20.029
Turn around right now,
and watch this exchange.

37:20.322 --> 37:22.990
That's "value added." Okay?

37:23.158 --> 37:24.450
If you have any demos
you'd like me

37:24.534 --> 37:25.826
to listen to,
I'll make the time.

37:26.912 --> 37:27.912
Oh, seriously?

37:27.996 --> 37:29.371
Mmm-hmm. Seriously, yeah.
Oh!

37:29.456 --> 37:31.081
Dax, did you see
what happened there?

37:31.207 --> 37:33.292
Uh-huh.
She did something that was helpful.

37:33.376 --> 37:36.587
And now I'm going to reward
her by listening to her demos.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.796
Turn back around.

37:38.340 --> 37:39.798
Now! Turn around, please.

37:41.843 --> 37:44.595
So, Snoop, uh, buddy,
we've got an idea.

37:44.679 --> 37:45.721
Me, too.

37:45.805 --> 37:47.973
Water skis, but for dry land.

37:48.058 --> 37:49.475
Real playa. You know what
I'm talking about?

37:49.559 --> 37:50.643
Brilliant.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.519
Fo shizzle, dizzle.

37:52.604 --> 37:53.604
I'll write that down.

37:53.688 --> 37:54.855
Yeah, please.

38:18.213 --> 38:19.296
What am I looking at?

38:19.381 --> 38:20.547
We're pillow fighting!

38:20.632 --> 38:21.632
Aah!

38:23.259 --> 38:24.885
You know this sets women back,
like, 30 years?

38:24.970 --> 38:26.595
We're just
relieving some stress.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.180
This was on the porch.

38:28.556 --> 38:29.556
Ooh.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.393
What is that? Looks fancy.

38:41.361 --> 38:43.404
Looks like we've been invited
to sing at some kind of a party.

38:43.488 --> 38:44.530
We're going to sing?

38:44.781 --> 38:45.781
Finally!

38:45.865 --> 38:47.992
Well, there's just
an address and a password.

38:48.076 --> 38:49.868
How sexy and mysterious.
Yeah.

38:50.412 --> 38:53.455
Like how all my teeth
are from other people.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.667
Ow!

39:02.549 --> 39:04.008
Anyone else scared?

39:04.092 --> 39:06.844
Not really.
I already lived longer than I expected.

39:10.932 --> 39:11.974
Password.

39:14.644 --> 39:15.936
Fart noise.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.772
Did you not see
the parentheses?

39:26.906 --> 39:30.159
Bellas! I'm so glad
you all came. Come on in.

39:31.745 --> 39:33.704
Standing in
front of you, ladies,

39:33.788 --> 39:38.709
happens to be the world's
biggest a cappella fan.

39:38.793 --> 39:39.918
We found you!

39:40.003 --> 39:41.086
Hello. Here I am.

39:41.171 --> 39:42.671
What can we do for you?

39:42.756 --> 39:45.382
So, last week when I was
having a tinkle, it occurred to me...

39:45.467 --> 39:46.884
Do not, do not!

39:47.761 --> 39:48.761
Sorry.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.012
That was rude.

39:50.096 --> 39:53.182
You do not come to a gentleman's
house and touch his goose.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.310
So are we early, or...

39:56.478 --> 40:00.439
Actually, you're pretty late.
Come on, let's go!

40:04.027 --> 40:05.986
This is the big time.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.001
Das Sound Machine,
two o'clock.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.837
Tiny Mouse! We meet again.

40:24.005 --> 40:25.839
Another verbal beatdown.

40:26.007 --> 40:27.633
Highlight of my day.

40:28.343 --> 40:31.637
So, have you abandoned your
foolish plans to face us at the Worlds?

40:32.138 --> 40:35.974
You wish,
you gorgeous specimen.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.435
She's really in my head.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.686
Very well.

40:39.854 --> 40:42.022
I'll be happy to
send you there.

40:42.190 --> 40:43.524
I'll mail you.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.859
Large envelope costs nothing.

40:46.027 --> 40:47.861
Well, it will cost
more than nothing.

40:48.029 --> 40:52.407
But still cheaper than shipping, like,
a horse, or perhaps an adult moose.

40:52.492 --> 40:54.201
Did you ever think
maybe you're too big?

40:54.285 --> 40:56.078
It would cost a fortune to mail you.
Easy.

40:56.162 --> 40:57.496
You're enormous!

40:57.580 --> 40:58.580
Okay.

40:58.665 --> 41:00.916
I think we should change
her name to "Feisty Mouse."

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Yeah.

41:02.377 --> 41:04.503
Just need to find, like,
a taller pair of shoes.

41:04.587 --> 41:05.587
Wasn't a big deal.
Hey!

41:05.713 --> 41:07.923
Hey! What are you doing here?
What is going on?

41:08.007 --> 41:09.758
Welcome!
I guess I gotta go.

41:09.843 --> 41:11.385
No. Why?
I don't know.

41:11.678 --> 41:15.556
Welcome to
the first ever showdown

41:15.640 --> 41:22.563
of the National A Cappella
Laser Ninja Dragon League!

41:24.691 --> 41:27.901
Can you dig it?

41:32.407 --> 41:34.408
Okay, let's meet our teams.

41:34.576 --> 41:37.244
First we have
The Treblemakers!

41:37.328 --> 41:38.871
Yeah!

41:40.331 --> 41:43.375
Okay.
We have the Barden Bellas.

41:45.378 --> 41:48.255
We have the Tone Hangers!

41:48.923 --> 41:50.340
Sorbet Sorbet

41:50.508 --> 41:52.176
Sorbet Sorbet

41:52.343 --> 41:56.054
And a cherry on top

41:56.723 --> 41:59.600
And taking a break
from their national tour,

41:59.684 --> 42:01.518
Das Sound Machine!

42:01.603 --> 42:02.686
- DSM!
- Ja!

42:02.770 --> 42:03.812
DSM!
Ja!

42:03.897 --> 42:05.272
DSM!
Ja!

42:05.773 --> 42:09.902
And the pride of Wisconsin,
the Green Bay Packers!

42:12.447 --> 42:14.114
Let's go! Here we go, baby!

42:14.616 --> 42:16.575
Let's go!
What?

42:16.743 --> 42:18.952
I'd like to be the brisket
in that man-sandwich.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.787
Well, here's how
this is gonna work.

42:20.955 --> 42:24.082
When I point to you,
you sing a song

42:24.250 --> 42:25.500
from one of the categories
that's gonna

42:25.585 --> 42:26.865
appear up there
on the big board.

42:27.128 --> 42:28.545
There's only one rule.

42:28.630 --> 42:31.298
You have to meet the beat.
Here, come here.

42:38.139 --> 42:41.808
But you have to do it
"Follow the Leader" style.

43:04.415 --> 43:05.916
Oh, boy!

43:06.000 --> 43:07.501
Oh, goodness.

43:07.627 --> 43:09.127
That was fun.

43:09.796 --> 43:14.841
Now, if you can't carry the tune,
the whole team's out.

43:15.009 --> 43:18.303
As in, you gone! And then...

43:18.471 --> 43:21.181
Cornelius, this is too heavy.
I told you before.

43:21.349 --> 43:23.517
Because I hurt my arm
saluting the flag.

43:24.686 --> 43:25.852
Okay, sorry.

43:26.020 --> 43:29.481
Now, the winners will get

43:30.024 --> 43:32.693
epic bragging rights!

43:33.194 --> 43:34.820
What?
That's it?

43:34.904 --> 43:36.738
Oh. And I'm sorry.
Did I not mention this?

43:36.823 --> 43:40.575
A $42,000 gift card
to Dave and Buster's!

43:41.160 --> 43:43.160
I was going there anyway.
I was going there anyway.

43:43.204 --> 43:45.289
I know Clay Matthews wants it.

43:46.666 --> 43:48.583
Okay. All right,
let's get this thing started.

43:48.668 --> 43:50.627
Let's take a look
at the first category.

43:51.546 --> 43:53.005
Ooh. Songs about butts.

43:53.423 --> 43:54.423
Okay.

43:54.924 --> 43:56.764
Anything on the radio,
basically, right? Right.

43:56.801 --> 43:58.468
Think about
what you're gonna sing.

43:58.678 --> 44:01.847
Let's start with
Das Sound Machine!

45:30.436 --> 45:31.561
Girl, I love that butt

45:31.646 --> 45:33.563
But the butt's not what matters
You know what does?

45:33.648 --> 45:35.565
Courtship and chivalry
I'll take you to a nice hot meal

45:35.650 --> 45:37.150
And I'll tip the waiter

45:37.318 --> 45:39.152
Oh, my God, stop! Stop!

45:39.320 --> 45:40.987
What was that, yo?

45:41.614 --> 45:43.782
Not how we play the game.

45:45.993 --> 45:50.372
You think you're a better
lyricist than Sir Mix-a-Lot,

45:50.540 --> 45:52.332
a man who was
knighted by Queen?

45:52.417 --> 45:54.418
You know the band Queen?
Yes.

45:54.502 --> 45:56.628
No, sir, I do not.
I just... I couldn't help it.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.713
I caught a glimpse
of an angel.

45:58.965 --> 46:00.173
I got inspired.

46:00.258 --> 46:01.758
Well, you're going to hell.

46:01.843 --> 46:04.469
Because,
Treblemakers, you gone!

46:04.804 --> 46:06.721
You gone!

46:07.181 --> 46:08.223
Bye-bye.
Sorry.

46:08.391 --> 46:10.016
Sorry. I'm sorry.

46:10.101 --> 46:11.393
Four left.

46:11.477 --> 46:14.062
Let's take a look
at the next category!

46:15.356 --> 46:17.065
Oh. Country love!

46:17.150 --> 46:18.191
Oh! Oh, oh!
I am all about this!

46:18.276 --> 46:20.318
Nobody in this room has loved
more tender than I have.

46:20.403 --> 46:21.403
Please pick us.

46:21.487 --> 46:22.571
Let me have it.

46:22.655 --> 46:25.240
Let us have it.
Let the world have it.
Yeah!

46:25.324 --> 46:26.575
I would give it to him.

46:26.659 --> 46:28.702
All right, then.
Well, why don't we start with you?

46:28.786 --> 46:30.412
Tone Hangers, you're up.
You're up.

46:30.496 --> 46:31.496
What?

46:31.539 --> 46:33.874
All right, I got this.
I got this. I got this.

46:34.375 --> 46:35.625
This is my jam!

46:35.710 --> 46:37.002
How about them Cowboys?

47:18.419 --> 47:19.586
Come on, man.

47:19.754 --> 47:21.129
I got nothing.
Come on!

47:21.255 --> 47:22.672
God damn it!
I got nothing, guys!

47:22.757 --> 47:24.090
What?

47:27.261 --> 47:28.720
- I'm sorry.
- You blew it.

47:28.804 --> 47:30.555
Man, you are such
a dis-a-ca-pointment.

47:30.640 --> 47:34.601
Reginald Wilson
Moncrieff Matthews IV,

47:34.685 --> 47:37.270
what on God's green one
are you doing?

47:38.356 --> 47:42.108
I had my mind on those
42 G's at D and B's.

47:42.276 --> 47:44.861
I'm afraid you've kissed that goodbye.
No!

47:45.029 --> 47:46.696
- Green Bay Packers...
- No, no, no!

47:46.864 --> 47:48.198
- ...you gone!
- No!

47:50.243 --> 47:52.452
Let's see what
the next category is!

47:53.454 --> 47:54.454
Oh.

47:55.164 --> 47:56.164
Yes! Oh!

47:56.791 --> 47:59.292
Oh, I was his
personal assistant!

47:59.460 --> 48:00.544
- Unfair!
- Come on.

48:00.628 --> 48:01.962
Yes, yep.
We got this.

48:02.046 --> 48:03.421
Yeah, we got this.
Get in there.

48:03.589 --> 48:05.870
Okay, then why don't we start with you,
Das Sound Machine?

49:04.400 --> 49:06.526
Is that John Mayer?

49:07.278 --> 49:08.695
That doesn't
deserve a "boo."

49:09.030 --> 49:10.614
I killed that!

49:11.198 --> 49:12.866
Explain for everyone,

49:13.034 --> 49:15.118
because it sounds like
you're implying

49:15.286 --> 49:19.205
that John Mayer and
Tina Turner are having...

49:19.290 --> 49:20.290
Oh, yeah.

49:20.625 --> 49:22.375
Get them out! Get them out!

49:22.460 --> 49:24.002
I don't know if I believe him.

49:24.086 --> 49:25.253
I'm telling the truth!

49:25.379 --> 49:26.671
Tone Hangers,

49:27.715 --> 49:28.715
you gone!

49:29.467 --> 49:31.384
Two! We have our final two!

49:31.594 --> 49:33.678
Now we have a showdown!

49:33.804 --> 49:35.221
All right, come on in.

49:35.389 --> 49:37.849
Let's do this
face-off style. Okay.

49:38.017 --> 49:40.894
Let's take a look,
see what your final category is.

49:42.897 --> 49:44.898
'90s hip-hop jams!

49:45.066 --> 49:47.567
Okay, y'all, take a second
to think about it.

49:47.860 --> 49:49.152
Time's up! Go!

50:45.835 --> 50:47.752
I got all I need
when I got you and I

50:47.920 --> 50:50.296
'Cause I look around me
and see a sweet life

50:50.756 --> 50:52.799
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight

50:52.883 --> 50:53.883
What?

50:53.968 --> 50:56.469
You're getting me, getting me
through the night

50:58.806 --> 51:00.598
I'm sorry.

51:01.142 --> 51:05.270
What '90s hip-hop jam
is that again?

51:05.438 --> 51:06.438
Um...

51:07.523 --> 51:10.984
More like a 21 st century jam.

51:11.152 --> 51:13.486
That's it. Yeah.
I wrote it.

51:18.325 --> 51:19.826
Just stay calm.

51:22.204 --> 51:24.247
You're saying
it's an original?

51:25.458 --> 51:27.041
Yes, I'm saying
it's an original.

51:27.209 --> 51:29.377
Boo!

51:29.962 --> 51:31.588
Go home, little girl!

51:33.299 --> 51:34.632
Our jam is covers!

51:34.800 --> 51:36.259
We spit on originals!

51:37.011 --> 51:38.595
What is your name?

51:38.763 --> 51:39.929
Emily.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.097
Emily.

51:42.308 --> 51:43.767
I hate you.

51:46.854 --> 51:49.814
In light of this embarrassing

51:50.775 --> 51:52.942
and
unprofessional information,

51:53.110 --> 51:56.112
I am forced to declare...

51:56.197 --> 51:57.197
I'm sorry, guys.

51:57.239 --> 52:00.909
...Das Sound Machine is the winner!
Yeah!

52:02.328 --> 52:03.328
Whoo!

52:03.537 --> 52:05.288
Yeah! Yeah!

52:05.748 --> 52:06.748
Oh.

52:19.386 --> 52:20.762
Hey, did you really
write that?

52:20.846 --> 52:22.722
You shouldn't have
done that, Emily.

52:22.807 --> 52:24.849
Now DSM thinks that
they have the drop on us.

52:24.934 --> 52:26.142
I'm sorry. I panicked.

52:26.227 --> 52:28.603
I understand if you want
me to crawl under a rock and die.

52:28.687 --> 52:29.813
Hey, we don't want...

52:29.897 --> 52:31.022
Hey, we don't want that.

52:31.190 --> 52:32.690
Hey, Becs,

52:32.775 --> 52:34.415
let's go meet the Green Bay Packers.
Okay.

52:44.703 --> 52:45.703
Whew.

52:48.082 --> 52:49.332
Boo!

52:51.335 --> 52:53.545
I'm just kidding.
Would you like to have sex later?

52:53.629 --> 52:54.712
No!

52:55.923 --> 52:57.590
So that's a "no," then?

52:57.675 --> 52:59.275
Because with the wink,
and that's what...

52:59.301 --> 53:00.802
It's 100% no!

53:19.363 --> 53:20.613
I want it! Give me!

53:28.873 --> 53:31.624
Dax. I swear, if this kid
was not my nephew...

53:31.709 --> 53:33.209
Hey, I know
you're crazy busy,

53:33.294 --> 53:35.837
but have you had a chance
to check out those demos?

53:35.921 --> 53:38.840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I did.

53:41.260 --> 53:43.511
This dead air between us
is a good sign.

53:43.971 --> 53:45.471
Look,

53:45.931 --> 53:47.015
you got a great ear,

53:47.099 --> 53:48.308
you proved that
in the booth,

53:48.392 --> 53:50.351
and I was super excited
to hear what else you had

53:50.436 --> 53:53.646
and what you gave me
was more mash-ups.

53:53.898 --> 53:55.690
That's sort of what I do.

53:56.150 --> 53:58.151
Listen, Reggie.
Is it "Reggie"?

53:58.319 --> 53:59.944
"Beca."

54:00.112 --> 54:02.322
Um, that happens a lot, though.
You'd be surprised.

54:02.406 --> 54:03.406
Okay.

54:03.490 --> 54:04.866
Here's the thing.

54:04.950 --> 54:07.744
Um, any kid with ears
and a laptop can do that.

54:07.828 --> 54:09.370
Dax can do that.

54:09.538 --> 54:10.580
All right?
Right.

54:10.664 --> 54:13.166
So that's fine
if you want a career

54:13.250 --> 54:14.834
deejaying raves
out in the desert.

54:14.919 --> 54:18.046
But if you want to write "music producer"
on your tax forms someday,

54:18.130 --> 54:20.131
then you've gotta have an original voice.
Do you understand?

54:20.215 --> 54:22.300
You've gotta show me
what you have.

54:22.384 --> 54:25.094
Right now, what I have is
a demo with mash-ups on it.

54:25.179 --> 54:26.220
Yeah, yeah.

54:26.430 --> 54:28.681
I got lots of stuff to say.
I'm just saving it all up.

54:28.766 --> 54:29.807
Look...

54:31.101 --> 54:32.101
Uh...

54:32.811 --> 54:34.062
What is it? "Beca"?
Beca.

54:34.146 --> 54:35.146
Okay, yeah.

54:36.148 --> 54:37.690
So, you're an intern,

54:37.775 --> 54:39.692
and everybody else
in here is an intern.

54:39.777 --> 54:42.904
You're talented,
everybody else in here is talented.

54:43.447 --> 54:46.366
So what the hell makes you special?
Do you know what I mean?

54:46.450 --> 54:47.909
That's good.

54:47.993 --> 54:51.788
So what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna give you one more shot

54:51.872 --> 54:56.084
to show me who you are
as an artist. Okay?

54:56.168 --> 54:57.543
Do not waste it.

54:57.878 --> 54:59.879
No, sir, will not waste it.

55:00.172 --> 55:02.131
I really hope you don't,
for your sake.

55:02.216 --> 55:03.383
'Cause I would hate to think

55:03.467 --> 55:05.907
that singing covers in an a
cappella group is all you can do.

55:07.137 --> 55:09.889
Please replace
the paper towels.

55:25.280 --> 55:27.740
Hey, it's Jesse. Text me.

55:28.993 --> 55:30.868
Hey, it's me. Um...

55:32.705 --> 55:34.789
Hey, so you might not be able
to hear this message,

55:34.915 --> 55:38.001
because, it turns out,
I have nothing to say.

55:38.836 --> 55:40.086
Um...

55:40.295 --> 55:43.172
That's music industry speak
for "I suck."

55:44.883 --> 55:46.592
You're definitely
asleep right now.

55:47.136 --> 55:48.845
That's cool.

55:49.388 --> 55:51.055
Text me when you're up.

55:51.223 --> 55:52.223
Hey.

55:53.517 --> 55:54.559
What?

55:54.727 --> 55:56.144
A girl can't say
she's going to grab

55:56.228 --> 55:58.271
a smoothie and return
14 hours later?

55:58.439 --> 56:00.148
There's nothing
suspicious about that.

56:02.192 --> 56:03.526
Why are you up
so late anyways?

56:04.361 --> 56:06.696
Um, I was just
figuring some stuff out.

56:06.864 --> 56:08.364
You're working on the set?

56:09.783 --> 56:10.783
Um...

56:11.952 --> 56:13.494
I'm not working on the set.
I'm just, like...

56:13.579 --> 56:14.579
What?

56:16.081 --> 56:18.207
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

56:23.714 --> 56:26.549
If you did wanna
share something with me,

56:26.842 --> 56:28.176
your best friend,

56:28.385 --> 56:30.428
I'm a great keeper of secrets.

56:30.596 --> 56:32.430
I'm like a safe that locks,

56:33.307 --> 56:34.307
with a key,

56:34.475 --> 56:37.518
and the key is stashed
up my bum. Because...

56:37.686 --> 56:39.854
It's fine.
Forget it. It's all good.

56:40.022 --> 56:43.107
So this has nothing to do with
that internship that you sneak off to?

56:43.192 --> 56:44.525
What?

56:45.194 --> 56:46.444
Um...
Come on, Beca.

56:46.612 --> 56:48.529
You know how we do
that thing every month

56:48.614 --> 56:51.783
where I take $20 out of your purse
and you pretend not to notice?

56:52.034 --> 56:54.327
I saw your ID badge
in your bag.

56:54.536 --> 56:56.037
Don't be mad.

56:56.205 --> 56:57.955
I'm not mad, actually.

56:58.290 --> 56:59.540
About the badge.

56:59.708 --> 57:01.876
The money,
I wanna come back to.

57:02.002 --> 57:03.002
Shh.

57:03.378 --> 57:05.630
Let's just focus
on your lie.

57:06.090 --> 57:07.173
Beca,

57:07.341 --> 57:09.008
why didn't you tell us?

57:10.010 --> 57:11.511
Or at least Chloe.

57:11.678 --> 57:14.639
I don't know. Just...
'Cause it's just easier.

57:14.807 --> 57:17.475
There's, like,
so much going on,
and Chloe would lose her mind

57:17.559 --> 57:20.853
if she thought my sole focus
wasn't winning Worlds.

57:20.979 --> 57:22.897
Sorry, it's just
now I'm freaking out,

57:23.315 --> 57:25.233
because it turns out,
like, I'm totally

57:25.317 --> 57:27.193
not good enough to
be a music producer.

57:27.277 --> 57:30.613
Which is cool and fun to know
as I enter the rest of my life.

57:30.739 --> 57:33.449
Okay, I'm just gonna
stop you right there.

57:33.617 --> 57:35.910
You're the most
talented person that I know,

57:35.994 --> 57:37.995
and I've met
three of The Wiggles.

57:38.580 --> 57:39.705
Intimately.

57:40.124 --> 57:41.124
Oh.

57:41.208 --> 57:43.960
Beca, do you know
how awesome you are?

57:44.169 --> 57:45.920
You're Beca effing Mitchell.

57:46.213 --> 57:47.213
Okay?

57:47.256 --> 57:48.673
You're "The Big B.M."

57:48.841 --> 57:49.966
That's you.

57:50.050 --> 57:51.259
And you're awesome!

57:53.595 --> 57:55.304
Do you need some
of my confidence?

57:55.389 --> 57:57.306
'Cause I could maybe
tone mine down a notch.

57:57.724 --> 57:59.475
Yeah, okay.

57:59.560 --> 58:01.561
Then let me rub some out.

58:02.312 --> 58:03.312
Oh, okay.

58:03.397 --> 58:05.481
Wait. Think you need
a bit more.

58:05.566 --> 58:06.649
It comes from there?

58:07.276 --> 58:09.277
Okay. Thank you.
You just need that.

58:09.361 --> 58:11.195
I'm gonna get you
the good stuff now.

58:11.280 --> 58:12.488
No, I don't want
butt confidence.

58:12.573 --> 58:14.157
I don't want your
butt confidence!

58:14.241 --> 58:15.366
No! I have enough!

58:15.659 --> 58:17.243
I have enough!
I have enough!

58:28.046 --> 58:29.297
I believe in you, Beca.

58:46.815 --> 58:48.441
Come on.

58:50.777 --> 58:53.362
Whoa.
Candles, cloth napkins,

58:53.864 --> 58:56.616
foods other than salsa.
Yep.

58:56.783 --> 58:59.869
This is a little classier
than our typical hook-ups.

58:59.953 --> 59:01.579
Is it? Huh.

59:01.663 --> 59:03.873
I have a patisserie,

59:03.957 --> 59:06.751
some charcuterie,

59:06.835 --> 59:10.755
and a huge bowl
of exotic capers.

59:10.839 --> 59:13.925
I didn't know what those were,
but they're like salty peas.

59:17.512 --> 59:18.888
So,

59:19.056 --> 59:21.515
I don't know if you've
seen the news lately,

59:21.850 --> 59:23.226
but there's a war.

59:23.477 --> 59:26.562
And also, the economy

59:28.690 --> 59:31.400
is dipping
and ebbing and flowing.

59:32.069 --> 59:33.694
Bumper, what's going on?

59:33.862 --> 59:35.571
Now you're kind of
creeping me out.

59:35.739 --> 59:38.074
Okay, I guess I'll just
lay it all out there.

59:38.367 --> 59:41.369
The reason that I
brought you here tonight

59:41.536 --> 59:43.621
was because
I was thinking that

59:43.789 --> 59:46.332
maybe, perhaps,

59:46.500 --> 59:48.209
if you're interested...

59:48.919 --> 59:50.836
This is harder than
I thought it was gonna be.

59:52.881 --> 59:54.382
I wanna date you.

59:54.549 --> 59:56.092
That's what I want.

59:56.510 --> 59:59.262
Like for real.
Like a real couple.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:03.975
Where we, like,
go out in public and hold hands

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:05.226
and ride bikes together.

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:08.688
Or we, like, go to
an orchard and pick apples.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.606
Or we, like,
do one of those, like,

01:00:10.691 --> 01:00:12.233
Build-A-Bear
Workshops together,

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:13.567
and we build bears,

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:15.987
and you name one "Bumper"
and I'll name one "Fat Amy,"

01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:18.906
and yours will be bigger
than mine and it'll be cute,

01:00:18.991 --> 01:00:22.076
and we can put them on
our bed that we share.

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:25.454
What do you say?

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:30.251
No.

01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:32.586
I don't...

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:35.214
I don't do that.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:37.508
Yeah, that's cool.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:38.968
It was a...
Cool.

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:40.303
It was a stupid idea anyways.
Yeah.

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:43.306
Obviously, we shouldn't do that.
We should just

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:46.517
go back to how things
used to be

01:00:47.728 --> 01:00:50.354
and just go at it on top of all this
expensive food that I bought.

01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:51.564
Are you crying?

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:55.568
Nope.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:56.736
No, I'm not.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:57.820
Bumper!

01:00:57.988 --> 01:01:00.156
Come on, you can't be serious.

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:03.034
I can't be tied down
by anything.

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:04.285
I'm on a walkabout.

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:07.288
I'm a free-range pony
that can't be tamed.

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:11.167
You know.

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:13.210
Okay.
I'm like a firework.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.505
I can't be tied down.
Okay.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.841
Then that's it. Then I
guess that's it, right?

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:21.719
Because I'm not gonna
keep going on like this.

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:23.262
Well...
Fine.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.973
Fine, if that's how you feel,
then I think we're done.

01:01:26.058 --> 01:01:27.141
I think it's over.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.018
That's it?
That's it, then.

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:33.647
So it's over, then.

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:34.899
Fine. Then it's over.

01:01:35.067 --> 01:01:36.233
Fine, then.

01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:43.991
No!

01:01:44.159 --> 01:01:46.285
Too late. You're too late!

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:47.912
I figured when we
didn't do the serenade,

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:49.455
the back-up plan
should be to play her off.

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:50.623
Turn around. Go back.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:52.416
I don't wanna
hear another peep!

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:54.752
Trebles for life

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.337
Benji!
I'm sorry.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.593
Hey, guys,
it's my first performance.

01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:05.596
Calm down.
It's just a chance for us
to rehearse for Worlds.

01:02:05.764 --> 01:02:08.307
As far as I can tell,
it's just for a bunch of old people.

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:20.361
There's a full house
out there.

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:22.071
How did we get
this gig again?

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.531
They called us.

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:24.698
You know what, guys?

01:02:24.866 --> 01:02:26.075
I know we're trying
a lot of new stuff,

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.535
but I feel like
we're gonna get out there

01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:28.869
and we're gonna
feel the energy

01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:30.579
and we are just
gonna nail all of it!

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:32.081
Sorry, these braids
are so tight.

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:34.083
You know what?
I don't know. I don't know.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:35.626
I have many, many doubts,

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:38.003
because if we fail this,
then we won't win the Worlds,

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.797
and if we don't win the Worlds,
there will be no more Bellas,

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:40.881
and without the Bellas,

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:43.843
then my life
would have had no...

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:47.388
"Malaria."

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.307
"Meaning," Flo.

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:52.476
Three, two...

01:02:52.811 --> 01:02:55.187
Hey, everybody.
Welcome back to Let's Talk-Appella,

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:57.273
the portable podcast edition.

01:02:57.357 --> 01:03:00.860
We are following the story of the
embattled Barden Bellas

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:02.736
on their road to redemption.

01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:05.823
Trying to crawl their way
back into the public's affection.

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:08.617
And if they can just hold off

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:11.537
showing us any more
of their genitalia,

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.831
they may make it to
the World Championship.

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:15.291
Well, I can't un-see it.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:16.876
It's haunted me ever since.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.085
Well, there's
a picture of it right here.

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:20.129
No. This should not be
your screensaver, John.

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:24.925
Stepping onto the stage,
the Barden Bellas.

01:03:56.917 --> 01:03:58.375
Whoa!
All right!

01:03:58.502 --> 01:04:00.628
This is some exciting stuff.
So sassy!

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:29.573
Wow.
A lot going on up there.

01:04:29.658 --> 01:04:30.908
I think this sounds good.

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:33.327
Honestly, my senses
are overwhelmed here, John.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.205
They might wanna
tone down the theatrics.

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:37.623
Let's hope
there are no props.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:39.667
Oh, they brought
the props out, John.

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:41.710
And there are the props.

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:44.046
This is more of a circus act than
an a cappella performance.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:45.714
Gail, it's as if
the Barden Bellas

01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:47.299
just don't know
who they are anymore.

01:04:57.644 --> 01:04:59.478
Whoa!

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:00.771
Look at this!

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:02.815
She's on fire! She's on fire!

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:05.067
Oh, my God!
I'm on fire!

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.402
Now they lit
one on fire.

01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:08.529
Good day! Good heavens!
Oh.

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:10.364
Incoming! Oh, my God,
I can't breathe!

01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:12.575
I can't breathe, girl!
Fat Amy, I can't breathe!

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.828
Beating DSM seems
impossible for this team.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.913
Even these
common people can see

01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:20.666
that the Barden Bellas
have no shot at reinstatement.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.418
They are
an embarrassment

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:24.670
to a cappella
and all that it stands for.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:28.299
This is what happens
when you send girls to college.

01:05:29.009 --> 01:05:30.092
Is it?

01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:40.060
Is that for a class?

01:05:40.478 --> 01:05:41.937
No, it's just
when I get stressed,

01:05:42.022 --> 01:05:43.342
words sort of
flow right out of me

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:44.857
and I try and channel them
in my songwriting...

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.860
Are we just gonna ignore
what happened back there?

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:48.944
Guys, hello?

01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:50.738
The Worlds are
right around the corner

01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:53.449
and you guys are acting like we
didn't just eat a big bag of... Ahhh!

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:54.617
Why are you yelling at me?

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:57.036
I almost burned to death
because of you a-ca-bitches.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.454
If you almost died,
it was only because

01:05:58.538 --> 01:05:59.872
you were standing
in the wrong spot.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.624
No! Flo flipped into me!

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:03.751
Sure. Blame the minority.

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:06.629
I'm black, gay, and a woman.

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.797
I'm not pointing
the finger at anybody.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.215
It was Legacy's fault.

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:11.467
Me? Wait, I didn't...

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:14.071
Obviously, we're not gonna
beat Das Sound Machine at their game.

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:16.555
So we need a new plan.
Like, now.

01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:21.602
At times like these,
there's only one thing for us to do.

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:24.688
Fake your own death
and flee the country.
Close.

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:27.733
We're going on a retreat.

01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:31.779
Look, I think the retreat
will be a good thing.

01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:34.657
You girls need to bond
heading into Worlds.

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:35.824
It'll be so much fun.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:38.118
I don't know.
No, Mom, it's bad. It's...

01:06:38.203 --> 01:06:40.621
The girls are yelling at each other.
Oh, big deal.

01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:42.581
I remember
putting your godmother,

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:44.416
Maggie Pistol,
in a choke hold,

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.710
because she insisted
that George Michael was gay.

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:48.837
Who?
Oh.

01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:52.466
I'm just worried that
my entire Bella career

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.760
will be that
one terrible performance.

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:58.013
And I'll never get to solo
at Lincoln Center, you know?

01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.848
But you're gonna
get to go to Europe.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.935
That would have been
the highlight of my college career.

01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:04.603
And you girls can win it.

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:06.105
You have to win it.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:08.982
You just made being a Bella
sound so amazing.

01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:10.776
And it is amazing.

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:14.571
It's a sisterhood that is gonna
support you for the rest of your life.

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:16.615
I know you're not feeling it,

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:17.991
but you will.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.703
This won't be the end
of the Bellas.

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:34.216
Hey, Benji.

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:35.467
Emily!

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:40.597
Listen, I think you're missing a word here.
What's that?

01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:44.309
Oh, God. No.
That's not... That isn't
what I meant. I just...

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:45.394
I didn't think so.

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:46.854
That's really embarrassing.
No, it looks...

01:07:46.938 --> 01:07:47.980
Syntax is usually my forte,

01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:49.690
so I don't know how that happened.
Well, it looks great.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:51.316
Thank you.
That's really sweet...

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:53.694
Um...

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.698
When my hands aren't
covered in glitter paint,

01:07:57.866 --> 01:08:00.075
do you think maybe
we could try that again?

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:03.912
Yeah. Sure.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.623
All right. Okay. Well...

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:10.377
I'll look forward to that.

01:08:10.545 --> 01:08:11.545
Just, you know,

01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:14.590
let me know when they're clean.
That's...

01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:15.758
I will.
All right.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:16.925
You bet.
Okay.

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:18.676
All right. Have a good one.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:24.015
Okay, girls!
Everyone, in the bus.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.059
Go, go, go!

01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:27.227
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:28.437
Seatbelts!

01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:31.231
Good luck, Benji!

01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:43.493
This place is sweet!

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:47.413
It's nice, right?

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:49.341
I need to find somewhere
to charge my laptop.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:51.408
How'd you hear
about this place?

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:53.002
From yours truly.

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:54.671
Hello, Bellas.

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:56.048
Aubrey!

01:08:56.174 --> 01:08:58.341
- Aubrey!
- Aubrey!

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:01.804
Okay, girls.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:03.180
Oh, wow. Hi!
You must be Emily.

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:05.557
Hey, hey.
Hey. Hi.

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:08.393
Welcome to
The Lodge at Fallen Leaves,

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:10.187
where Fortune 500
companies send

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:11.939
their employees to
build teamwork skills.

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:13.816
You run this whole place?

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.149
You know,
I realized I had a knack for

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:17.444
barking orders and
bending people's will.

01:09:17.529 --> 01:09:19.613
So I made a career out of it.

01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:22.241
Which reminds me,

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:23.992
fall in line, Bellas!

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.118
She ain't changed.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:27.162
No slouching! No straggling!

01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:29.081
I see you, Jessica.

01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:33.460
It is with great
sorrow and regret

01:09:33.795 --> 01:09:37.673
that I had to watch
our once proud organization

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:40.926
become a national disgrace!

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:44.470
Can I have the keys
to the minibar?

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:46.014
Zip it.

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:50.352
The Worlds signifies
a shot at redemption.

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.020
You don't have
a chance at winning

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:54.439
until you find
your sound again.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:57.234
You have totally
lost your harmony!

01:09:57.402 --> 01:10:00.028
So, for the next two days,

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:03.866
you will be doing everything
together until you regain it.

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:07.160
Ladies,
get ready to be transformed.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:11.081
You are surrounded with
the strength of your fellow Bellas

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:15.210
and the support of
a proud female tradition.

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:17.254
And a few dozen bear traps.

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:18.630
So don't stray too far
from the marked paths.

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:20.883
- Okay, great, let's go!
- All right.

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:23.468
Well, maybe I'll just
start with a hot shower,

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:24.761
maybe a little foot rub.

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:27.764
Fat Amy, there are no
guest rooms for you.

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:29.933
Then where are we staying?

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:39.651
I don't understand camping.

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:42.112
We're voluntarily
living like dogs.

01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:45.407
This is the worst.

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:48.327
The air we're breathing
right now is at least 90% fart.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:51.371
That reminds me,

01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:53.290
I need to see
a man about a horse.

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:56.919
Oh!

01:10:58.129 --> 01:11:00.797
Did anyone happen to pack
a spare roll of toilet paper?

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:02.674
- Or a moist towelette?
- Nope.

01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:06.261
Anyone have a T-shirt,
size extra-small?

01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:09.348
Okay.
Side of the tent it is.

01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:15.020
What are we doing here?

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.229
We're bonding.

01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:18.273
You seem so tense.
Do you need a back rub?

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:20.609
Several body parts are
rubbing my back right now, thank you.

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:22.110
You know, Beca,
we're very close,

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:23.862
but I feel like this retreat
is really gonna let us

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:25.614
discover everything
about each other.

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:26.698
Is that right?

01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:29.534
You know,
one of my biggest regrets

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:32.329
is that I didn't do enough
experimenting in college.

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:34.039
You're so weird.

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:35.207
Thanks.

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:36.833
I wanna go home.

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:43.799
I hope the sun never comes up.

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:48.303
Why do I get
the travel pillow?

01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:50.555
Were you touching my goodies?

01:11:51.683 --> 01:11:52.849
Yes.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:58.146
Oh, guys,
I've got a little...
It won't...

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:00.482
I just need some
help getting it out.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.234
Can you sing something?

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:04.236
The pipe's a bit blocked.

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:09.700
Thanks, Chloe.

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:15.205
What kind of
white shit is this?

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:20.335
Coming out
like froyo now.

01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:31.847
Up and at 'em, Bellas!
Come on! Let's go!

01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:34.516
Let's go!
Let's wake up!
Let's do this!

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.268
Come on!
Pick up the pace, girls!

01:12:36.436 --> 01:12:37.436
Come on!

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.980
Today we are going
back to the basics

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:41.523
to re-learn how
to sing as a group,

01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:44.818
while also enduring death-defying
team-building trust exercises.

01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:46.111
What a great idea!

01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:48.405
Okay, so let's begin.

01:12:54.162 --> 01:12:55.162
Come on.

01:13:14.432 --> 01:13:15.432
Trust your team!

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:20.296
- Careful, Fat Amy!
- Turn me over!

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:22.105
Come on, lunch!

01:13:34.494 --> 01:13:36.203
She says
she's Asian Jesus.

01:14:23.876 --> 01:14:24.876
Great.

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:28.547
Okay, that was two steps away
from being almost fine.

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:30.006
Sorry, what are we doing?

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.134
We're rediscovering
our sound.

01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:33.218
Are we?

01:14:33.553 --> 01:14:34.845
'Cause it feels like
we're just singing songs

01:14:34.929 --> 01:14:36.221
that would
never go in our set.

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:37.389
Beca, come on.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.057
No, none of us know
how to beat Das Sound Machine,

01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:40.976
but I know it's not
gonna be by doing this.

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:43.895
This is just an exercise
in finding harmony, Beca.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.772
Sometimes you have
to break things down

01:14:45.857 --> 01:14:46.898
before you can build
them back up again.

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:49.151
I've got more important
things to do!

01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:50.819
What could be more
important than this?

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:52.195
Nothing. Forget it.

01:14:52.697 --> 01:14:54.322
No, you don't think
that we haven't all realized

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:55.991
you've been a little
checked-out lately?

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:57.534
Come on, Beca, just tell her.

01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:58.910
I heard that.

01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:00.162
Tell me what?

01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:02.914
Oh, you misunderstood me.
I clearly said...

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:08.503
Listen, I don't
want you guys to fight.

01:15:08.588 --> 01:15:11.339
You're Beca and Chloe.
Together you're "Bloe."

01:15:11.424 --> 01:15:13.049
And everyone
loves a good bloe.

01:15:13.593 --> 01:15:14.843
So...

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:16.178
Okay.

01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:18.346
I've been interning
at a recording studio

01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:20.015
and a legit music producer
wants to hear my work.

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:22.100
God forbid I have something
going on outside this group.

01:15:22.185 --> 01:15:23.185
Okay.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:25.145
So why would you keep
something like that from us?

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:27.022
'Cause you're obsessed!
You all are.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:28.690
We're graduating,
and the only person

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:30.650
thinking about life
after the Bellas is me.

01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:33.111
What is so wrong
with being focused on the Bellas?

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:35.614
This has been my family
for seven years.

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.508
Yeah, 'cause you're
too scared to leave!

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:38.700
Sack up, dude!

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:40.035
Girl fight!

01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:42.454
Okay, so you've been lying
to us for the entire year

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:43.538
and now you're
just gonna flake out?

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:44.873
Now you're
gonna flake out when

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:46.333
the Worlds is, like,
right after graduation?

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:48.793
Oh, my God!
Enough about the Worlds! I...

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:50.170
I'm out of here.

01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:51.546
Oh, okay, you're just
gonna leave now?

01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:52.714
We all have to,
eventually, Chloe!

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:54.382
It might as well be now!

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:55.508
Wait, Beca...

01:15:55.593 --> 01:15:57.093
If you all knew what was good for you,
you'd follow me.

01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:58.428
Beca, the sign!

01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:01.556
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:02.682
Oh, no, Beca! Beca!

01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:04.726
What the hell?
I'm stuck!

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.853
I'm stuck! I'm seeing spots!
I'm seeing spots!

01:16:06.938 --> 01:16:08.730
Well, well, well.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:10.232
Look who needs our help.

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:11.733
Not cool, guys!

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:15.237
No, what's not cool is you
taking out your frustrations on us!

01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:17.239
Really? That's what you're
gonna say to me right now?

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:19.491
Help me! I'm dying! I'm dying!

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:24.246
We need to get her down!
We need a ladder!

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:25.705
No, we don't believe in ladders.
What?

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:27.207
They suggest
a corporate hierarchy

01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:29.451
that is counter-productive
to my team-building program.

01:16:29.502 --> 01:16:32.379
What kind of operation
are you running here?

01:16:32.463 --> 01:16:35.382
Seriously, this whole place is, like,
full of booby traps!

01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:36.591
And guess what?

01:16:36.676 --> 01:16:38.969
Boobs should
never be trapped!

01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:41.846
Unless it's for support
if you have lower back issues.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.599
Okay! If I'm about
to die, I'm sorry!

01:16:44.684 --> 01:16:46.268
I didn't mean
any of that stuff I said!

01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:48.103
I love all of you!
I love all of you awesome nerds,

01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:50.867
- and I love being a Bella.
- I'm just so stressed out right now...

01:16:51.232 --> 01:16:52.607
Oh, my God!
Oh, my gosh!

01:16:52.692 --> 01:16:55.485
Jessica and Ashley, I don't actually
know which one of you is which.

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:57.112
I'm Jessica!
I'm Jessica!

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:59.489
Don't worry, we're gonna get you down!
Focus up.

01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:01.283
Get in formation,
we can do this. Flo, get up.
Okay.

01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:02.575
- Fat Amy, come on!
- Yes!

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:04.786
Let's focus.
Work together as a team.

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:05.996
Don't worry, Beca, we got...

01:17:11.419 --> 01:17:12.585
She's alive.

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:16.381
I sleep upside
down like a bat.

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:25.432
It's just everything's
changing so fast

01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:28.059
and I'm putting all this
pressure on myself, you know?

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:29.728
I don't wanna fail.

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:31.532
But if you just would
have said something...

01:17:31.605 --> 01:17:34.274
Yeah, I know. But I'm
weird about that stuff.

01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:37.277
I thought I could figure it out on my own,
and I can't.

01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:40.655
Maybe I don't have
anything original to say.

01:17:41.532 --> 01:17:43.491
I wish I could do what you do.

01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:47.162
Well, I feel
the same way about you.

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:49.581
You're so good,
it's intimidating.

01:17:49.749 --> 01:17:53.168
All I've ever wanted
is to be one of you.

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:56.254
Not a Legacy, but a Bella.

01:17:56.756 --> 01:17:58.381
You are a real Bella.
Of course you're a Bella.

01:17:58.549 --> 01:18:01.593
You are one of us.
You paid the registration fee.

01:18:02.595 --> 01:18:04.429
That's for life, dude.

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:08.099
Do you wanna
collaborate on something?

01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:11.936
Wait. Are you being serious?

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:13.605
Yeah.

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:15.273
Yeah!

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:16.441
Wow!

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:20.612
Man! Yes! Who else feels
like a winner tonight?

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:26.701
I know it
doesn't seem like it,

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:28.453
but I'm afraid, too.

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:31.414
To move on, to graduate.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:33.875
It's really scary.

01:18:34.085 --> 01:18:36.044
Yeah, it actually
does seem like it,

01:18:36.128 --> 01:18:38.046
because you're barely
holding it together.

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:40.799
Well, it doesn't
have to be scary, Chloe.

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:43.468
When I was graduating,
I never pictured myself

01:18:43.636 --> 01:18:47.138
running a retreat in
the middle of the woods,

01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:49.099
but here I am.

01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:54.062
Take it from someone who has
dealt with some serious control issues.

01:18:55.481 --> 01:18:57.232
Like my dad always said,

01:18:57.983 --> 01:18:59.651
in the minefield of life,

01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:03.154
you must be prepared
to lose both feet.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:06.741
And I think you all know
what I mean.

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:08.326
I don't.

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:10.453
Then it's decided.

01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:12.664
This year I will graduate.

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:15.125
The Worlds will
be my swan song.

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:17.961
I mean it.
I'll pursue my passion.

01:19:18.129 --> 01:19:20.338
I'll teach underprivileged
children how to sing,

01:19:20.506 --> 01:19:22.340
or I'll dance exotically.

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:24.926
Whatever offers
the most money.

01:19:27.304 --> 01:19:28.638
Yo, check this out.

01:19:28.848 --> 01:19:31.182
I'm moving to Maine
to get hitched.

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:32.559
And all y'all can come.

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:34.227
Everybody's invited.

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:36.438
Yes, yes, yes.

01:19:37.398 --> 01:19:41.192
Okay, okay, guys.
Stop asking. I'll tell you.

01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:46.281
So, after I graduate there's a chance
I will be deported.

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:48.366
I will try to
re-enter this country,

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:50.368
but I will
probably die at sea.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.455
So, let's live for tonight!
Yes!

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:54.706
Yeah!

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:56.583
- Yes!
- All right.

01:19:57.918 --> 01:19:59.419
Lilly, any plans?

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:02.213
Just gonna
travel through time.

01:20:05.926 --> 01:20:07.343
You know,
when I look back on this,

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:09.554
I won't remember
performing and competing.

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.264
I'm gonna remember
you weirdos.

01:20:12.683 --> 01:20:14.142
It makes me
really sad to think

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:16.060
it won't ever be
like this again.

01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:18.480
I'm gonna miss you guys.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.732
Me, too.
Me, too.

01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:23.109
Yeah. Me, too.

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:19.791
Did we just find our sound?

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:21.751
I think we did.

01:21:23.921 --> 01:21:25.755
My work here is done.

01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:28.424
Thank you.

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:32.554
Fat Amy, you never told us what
you were gonna do after graduation.

01:21:32.638 --> 01:21:33.638
Oh. Well...

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:34.889
Mmm.

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.724
No, I don't have any plans.

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:40.144
'Cause you guys know me,
I just love living in the moment.

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:42.230
Ashley, what are
you gonna do after...

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:43.314
Actually, though,

01:21:43.983 --> 01:21:45.900
if we were to stop
and really think,

01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:48.945
"What could Fat Amy
be capable of in the future?"

01:21:49.488 --> 01:21:50.822
I'll tell you guys.

01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:54.617
I'd be living somewhere,
like, sick, like Tulsa or Little Rock.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:59.998
By day, I'm a professional
jelly wrestler for corporate events.

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:02.458
And then, every night,

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:06.462
it's just me cuddled up
with my fiancé, Bumper, and...

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:08.673
Oh, wait.

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:13.761
I'm in love with Bumper.

01:22:13.846 --> 01:22:14.846
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.

01:22:15.014 --> 01:22:17.849
Okay, I've done
something terrible,

01:22:18.017 --> 01:22:21.269
and I'm not talking about
crop-dusting Chloe and Beca right now.

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:22.604
Apologize for that.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:25.940
You guys,
I need to go right now.

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:27.942
And I need to
win back my man!

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:29.611
Screw your judgments!

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:32.530
Go get him, Fat Amy!

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:37.869
Guys, what happened?

01:22:38.037 --> 01:22:39.203
Shake it off, Amy.

01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:40.371
That was bad.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:42.206
Somebody bring a s'more.

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:44.876
I give you
our next album cover.

01:22:45.044 --> 01:22:46.377
Look at him!

01:22:46.545 --> 01:22:48.463
I did it all myself today.

01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:50.465
Now, I know that I
only have one vote...

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:52.258
You got no votes, man.
You're not in the group, so...

01:22:52.343 --> 01:22:53.635
Okay, well,
that hurts my feelings.

01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:54.802
It's just the truth,
is the thing.

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:56.007
Well, that hurts
my feelings.

01:22:56.055 --> 01:22:58.973
With my vote,
I vote "no" to the pig

01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:01.351
and "yes" to
this gloriousness.

01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:03.395
Yeah, it's great.
We'll put it to a vote later.
No.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.229
Bumper, I'm coming!

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:46.813
Nope! Turn it around!

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:00.159
I don't wanna see you!

01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:10.253
Whew. Really misjudged
the size of this lake.

01:24:10.421 --> 01:24:12.588
Why didn't she just
walk around the lake?

01:24:12.756 --> 01:24:14.298
Fat Amy doesn't
do anything small.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:16.551
Yes, I've been using
my shower shoes.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:18.469
Okay, I love you, too.
Here she is.

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:22.765
What up, Mrs. Junk?

01:24:40.159 --> 01:24:41.325
Go!

01:24:44.121 --> 01:24:45.747
Well, what are you doing?

01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:48.249
I'm soloing, here!

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.168
Whatever!

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:01.804
No!

01:26:06.245 --> 01:26:07.245
Well, all right.

01:26:10.249 --> 01:26:12.542
All right, let's go.
Into the house.

01:26:13.252 --> 01:26:14.669
Give me that neck.

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:17.713
I mean, we can do...
Do you want it...

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:20.508
Do you feel like you'd
want to layer a bunch of voices?

01:26:21.385 --> 01:26:24.512
I think in the beginning
it could definitely build.

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:26.430
I think it starts
out light, though.

01:26:26.598 --> 01:26:28.683
Get your cute butt
in the studio, then.

01:26:28.767 --> 01:26:30.685
Don't tell my boss that
we were in here, by the way.

01:26:30.769 --> 01:26:32.144
I got all I need
when I got you and I

01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:35.690
'Cause I look around me
and see a sweet life

01:26:36.108 --> 01:26:37.108
This is... Wow!

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:39.694
It's the real deal.

01:26:39.778 --> 01:26:40.945
Yeah, don't touch
anything, Legacy.

01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:42.673
You're very pretty,
but you seem clumsy.

01:26:43.282 --> 01:26:44.407
Great.

01:26:44.575 --> 01:26:45.575
Okay.

01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:48.286
Can't lie
it's a sweet life

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:52.707
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight

01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:55.668
You're getting me
Getting me through the night

01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:00.089
You're my flashlight

01:27:01.091 --> 01:27:03.593
You're my flashlight

01:27:04.511 --> 01:27:07.305
You're my flashlight

01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:15.146
Okay, so you produced this?

01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:16.939
Uh, yes. Emily wrote it.

01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:18.816
Mmm-hmm. Who's Emily?
I am.

01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:21.485
This tall drink of water,
right there. Hey. Emily.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.112
Well...

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:25.239
Um...

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.325
I don't... I don't...
I don't like it.

01:27:27.993 --> 01:27:32.246
What it is, is I don't like it when
people can do what I can do.

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:35.583
You know, in a manner of speaking,
it's threatening.

01:27:35.834 --> 01:27:38.002
But, you just did it.

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:40.671
And I have a...

01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:44.634
I have a few notes
that I assume that you're open to.

01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:46.802
Yes.
Um, but this is a solid demo,

01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:48.930
with real potential.

01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:52.016
Yeah, I look forward
to working together.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.225
It's nice to meet you.

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:55.019
What is it? Elizabeth?
Emily.

01:27:55.187 --> 01:27:56.270
Emily.
Elizabeth? What?

01:27:56.355 --> 01:27:58.356
Emily. Thank you.
Thank you.

01:27:58.899 --> 01:28:00.858
Oh.
I gotta jump on a call.

01:28:00.943 --> 01:28:03.611
Yeah, no.
No, get it in there.
Get it in there. Attagirl.

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:04.987
You want one of these?
Oh, hey.

01:28:05.072 --> 01:28:07.114
You want one of those?
There you go. Attagirl. Ow!

01:28:07.824 --> 01:28:08.824
Good job, Reggie.

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:10.201
I'm Reggie.

01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:12.954
Oh, my God, I was so nervous
I didn't know what to say!

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:14.246
Oh, my God!

01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:15.373
You're all sweaty.

01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:16.874
We're gonna be late!

01:28:16.959 --> 01:28:18.709
We're taking the photo
with or without you.

01:28:18.877 --> 01:28:21.170
We're taking the photo
with or without you!

01:28:21.338 --> 01:28:23.673
Everybody get together.
No, no, no, together.

01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:27.718
One, two, three!
Bellas for life!

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:50.074
Okay. So, is there
a restaurant in this town

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:51.325
that serves
something other than fish?

01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:52.827
I did see a KFC back there.

01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:54.161
Nope. All fish. I checked.

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:56.414
Guys, over here.
Come this way.

01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:58.499
Oh, Chloe,
I'm coming for ya!

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:03.587
Whoo-hoo. College graduates!
- Spreading my wings, y'all!

01:29:04.089 --> 01:29:06.173
There are so many
fresh Danishes here.

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:08.551
I swear, if I wasn't
recently locked down,

01:29:08.719 --> 01:29:11.095
I would tear a hole
through this city!

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.056
This place is so
smelly and rainy.

01:29:14.224 --> 01:29:16.392
Why do Americans
ever leave America?

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.020
Culture, design, history.

01:29:20.939 --> 01:29:22.440
I'm not
copen-hating this place.

01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:23.607
I'm starving.

01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:26.277
Yeah, why don't we go visit
Hayden Christian Andersen's house?

01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:30.072
That guy? But he was pretty crap
in the Star Wars prequels.

01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:39.623
Well, here we are.

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:41.834
Do you think the stage is big
enough for what we want to do?

01:29:42.002 --> 01:29:44.420
You're kidding, right?
It's huge.

01:29:44.838 --> 01:29:46.088
You guys think it'll work?

01:29:46.256 --> 01:29:48.674
It'll work for us.
That's what matters.

01:29:49.634 --> 01:29:51.260
Let's go!

01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:55.473
Let's do this thing!

01:29:56.433 --> 01:29:57.433
Whoo!

01:29:57.642 --> 01:29:59.042
Everyone knows
where to meet, right?

01:29:59.144 --> 01:30:01.312
Yeah, we know.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.481
All right.
Safety first, Flo.

01:30:29.132 --> 01:30:31.634
Here it is, folks.
The granddaddy of them all.

01:30:32.219 --> 01:30:34.386
The World Championship
of A Cappella!

01:30:34.554 --> 01:30:36.806
Tonight, groups from
around the globe duke it out

01:30:36.973 --> 01:30:38.849
for the title of
A-ca World Champion.

01:30:39.017 --> 01:30:42.686
And, of course,
representing America,
the embattled Barden Bellas.

01:30:42.854 --> 01:30:46.398
The Bellas, making one last attempt
to repair a damaged legacy

01:30:46.566 --> 01:30:49.193
by becoming the first American
team to claim the title.

01:30:49.361 --> 01:30:50.402
Can they do it, John?

01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:52.530
Theoretically, yes, Gail.

01:30:52.697 --> 01:30:56.200
Realistically, absolutely not.
Those girls are dead to me.

01:30:56.368 --> 01:30:58.494
So many countries
represented here tonight, John.

01:30:58.662 --> 01:31:01.705
We saw in rehearsal
an incredible group from the Philippines.

01:31:01.873 --> 01:31:03.040
What were they called?

01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:04.667
"The Ladyboys."

01:31:04.835 --> 01:31:06.502
That wasn't the name of the group,
I don't think.

01:31:06.670 --> 01:31:08.045
I think that's how
they described themselves.

01:31:08.213 --> 01:31:09.839
That's right.
They're "Manila Envy."

01:31:09.923 --> 01:31:10.923
Manila Envy.

01:31:11.007 --> 01:31:12.466
You know,
I spent some time with

01:31:12.551 --> 01:31:15.469
some ladyboys, uh,
in the Philippines myself.

01:31:15.554 --> 01:31:16.554
Not surprising.

01:31:16.721 --> 01:31:18.597
Very interesting young men.

01:31:18.765 --> 01:31:20.725
Doing amazing things
with their mouths, I presume.

01:31:20.892 --> 01:31:23.894
When we go back to the stage,
I'll do a few for you here.

01:31:24.062 --> 01:31:26.397
Uh, you know,
we can get to it, I think.
Okay.

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:28.321
You know, maybe when
the Koreans are out there,

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.776
because no one cares
about the Korean group.

01:31:30.861 --> 01:31:32.528
Love that barbeque.

01:31:39.619 --> 01:31:40.953
What are you doing here?

01:31:41.121 --> 01:31:42.121
Oh, you...

01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:44.415
You know, anything
to support the Bellas.

01:31:44.875 --> 01:31:45.875
Wow. I...

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.753
Now I'm the one
who can't speak.

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:52.131
I'm just so
freaking nervous.

01:31:52.215 --> 01:31:53.215
Oh, my God. Don't be.

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:54.425
You'll be great.

01:31:54.593 --> 01:31:56.594
I mean, we heard you guys rehearsing,
like, 24/7.

01:31:57.637 --> 01:31:59.597
So I'll... I should
probably go find my seat.

01:32:00.098 --> 01:32:01.473
Yeah.

01:32:01.641 --> 01:32:03.767
But before I go, I just...

01:32:04.144 --> 01:32:05.603
I have something for you.

01:32:09.524 --> 01:32:10.524
Oh...

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:17.031
I'm so sorry. I thought that
that was going in a different direction.

01:32:17.115 --> 01:32:19.033
- That's my bad.
- No, no, I liked it.

01:32:19.117 --> 01:32:20.117
Em, you ready?

01:32:21.494 --> 01:32:23.621
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll be right there.

01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:25.289
Benji.

01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:28.083
Okay. Well, break a leg.

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:57.715
DSM! Ja!
DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

01:34:10.729 --> 01:34:13.897
DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:16.900
DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

01:34:17.068 --> 01:34:18.569
DSM! Ja!

01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:29.747
- Ooh!
- Well done!

01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:33.167
There they go,
the Indian group,
the Naan-Stops,

01:34:33.251 --> 01:34:36.337
running off stage to
take a few more of our jobs.

01:34:36.463 --> 01:34:38.464
I thought
the little one was spicy!

01:34:40.592 --> 01:34:44.053
DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:46.221
And coming up next,
Das Sound Machine.

01:34:46.389 --> 01:34:47.431
A crowd favorite, John.

01:34:47.599 --> 01:34:50.684
DSM! Ja!
DSM! Ja! DSM! Ja!

01:34:50.769 --> 01:34:51.769
Hear that?

01:34:52.103 --> 01:34:54.480
They chant. For us.

01:34:54.939 --> 01:34:57.483
Now, don't cry too hard
when you lose, huh?

01:34:57.650 --> 01:34:59.151
Makes eyes puffy.

01:34:59.319 --> 01:35:00.903
Your hands are so soft.

01:35:01.071 --> 01:35:03.447
I'm sorry,
I don't speak "loser."
What did you say?

01:35:03.573 --> 01:35:05.449
She actually speaks
eight languages,

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:07.368
but "loser" is
not one of them.

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:09.078
Everything must
come to an end.

01:35:09.245 --> 01:35:10.454
Even the Bellas.

01:35:10.622 --> 01:35:11.914
Take care
and lose nice.

01:35:13.291 --> 01:35:15.667
Huh, your sweat
smells like cinnamon.

01:35:15.752 --> 01:35:16.752
Damn it!

01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:27.137
...Das Sound Machine!

01:35:42.237 --> 01:35:43.237
DSM!

01:37:31.804 --> 01:37:33.889
They've got
the crowd going wild!

01:37:34.057 --> 01:37:35.140
Okay, shake it off.

01:37:35.308 --> 01:37:38.143
DSM! DSM!

01:37:38.311 --> 01:37:39.478
Das Sound Machine.

01:37:39.562 --> 01:37:42.898
An incredible performance
once again from the German group.

01:37:42.982 --> 01:37:44.358
I'm telling you, Gail, though,

01:37:44.442 --> 01:37:46.360
if the Bellas of old
show up tonight,

01:37:46.444 --> 01:37:49.530
this could be the most
significant conflict

01:37:49.614 --> 01:37:52.658
between America and
Germany in history.

01:37:52.825 --> 01:37:54.117
Crack a book, John.

01:37:57.956 --> 01:38:01.083
Pass one down to your friends.
Here you go. Thank you.

01:38:01.292 --> 01:38:02.834
All right, here you go, buddy.

01:38:03.086 --> 01:38:04.086
Thanks, man.

01:38:04.170 --> 01:38:05.504
Where have you been?

01:38:05.838 --> 01:38:07.631
You have no idea, dude.

01:38:07.799 --> 01:38:09.299
Final performance, guys.

01:38:09.467 --> 01:38:11.802
We need to get out there
and beat DSM.

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:14.096
This one's for us.

01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:16.223
Guys, there's gonna be
some haters out there.

01:38:16.683 --> 01:38:19.726
They're gonna
look at us, Team USA,

01:38:19.811 --> 01:38:22.646
and be like, "Why is the most
talented one Australian?"

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:27.442
Well, guess what. I am fat.
So that is close enough.

01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:30.904
We are gonna show them
who we are.

01:38:31.072 --> 01:38:33.073
A bunch of ethnically diverse,

01:38:33.241 --> 01:38:35.325
for the most part feminine,

01:38:35.493 --> 01:38:37.452
amazing singers!

01:38:37.537 --> 01:38:38.579
Yeah!

01:38:38.663 --> 01:38:40.372
Let's just go out there
and ac' the world!

01:38:40.456 --> 01:38:41.582
Yes!

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:42.833
Yeah!
Yes!

01:38:43.001 --> 01:38:45.002
John, it's possible
we are watching

01:38:45.086 --> 01:38:47.045
the last hurrah
of the Barden Bellas.

01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:49.256
It's going to be very
hard to pull this off,

01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:50.841
and if they don't,

01:38:50.925 --> 01:38:54.094
they are out of business
as an a cappella group.

01:38:54.178 --> 01:38:55.262
It is over.

01:38:55.930 --> 01:38:58.140
All right! Let's do this!

01:38:59.350 --> 01:39:01.685
...Barden University's Bellas!

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:05.897
Yes!
Whoo!

01:39:05.982 --> 01:39:07.316
That's my girl!

01:39:07.483 --> 01:39:08.984
Beca!

01:41:16.154 --> 01:41:17.904
When tomorrow comes

01:41:17.989 --> 01:41:19.322
I'll be on my own

01:41:19.490 --> 01:41:22.492
Feeling frightened of
The things that I don't know

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:24.161
When tomorrow comes

01:41:24.328 --> 01:41:25.787
When tomorrow comes

01:41:25.955 --> 01:41:27.664
When tomorrow comes

01:41:27.832 --> 01:41:28.999
When tomorrow comes

01:41:29.167 --> 01:41:31.918
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky

01:41:32.086 --> 01:41:34.713
Is it possible
the Barden Bellas

01:41:34.797 --> 01:41:36.840
are doing an original song?

01:41:37.133 --> 01:41:38.592
Then I sing along

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.343
Then I sing along

01:41:40.511 --> 01:41:42.262
Then I sing along

01:41:42.513 --> 01:41:45.265
I got all I need
when I got you and I

01:41:45.349 --> 01:41:48.351
'Cause I look around me
and see your sweet life

01:41:48.519 --> 01:41:51.521
I'm stuck in the darkness
You're my flashlight

01:41:51.689 --> 01:41:54.524
You're gettin' me gettin' me
through the night

01:41:54.776 --> 01:41:57.819
You kick start my heart
when you shine it in my eyes

01:41:57.987 --> 01:41:59.154
I can't lie

01:41:59.363 --> 01:42:00.947
It's a sweet life

01:42:01.115 --> 01:42:04.159
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight

01:42:04.327 --> 01:42:06.953
You're gettin' me
through the night

01:42:13.503 --> 01:42:14.503
Look at this!

01:42:14.545 --> 01:42:16.296
It looks like
the Barden Bellas are being

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:18.965
joined on stage by
generations of Bellas,

01:42:19.050 --> 01:42:21.051
going all the way
back to the beginning.

01:42:21.219 --> 01:42:22.969
'Cause you're my flashlight

01:42:23.054 --> 01:42:24.137
'Cause you're my flashlight

01:42:24.305 --> 01:42:25.806
'Cause you're my flashlight

01:42:25.890 --> 01:42:27.349
'Cause you're my flashlight

01:42:27.517 --> 01:42:29.309
You're my flashlight

01:42:29.393 --> 01:42:32.395
You're gettin' me
through the night

01:42:32.563 --> 01:42:35.232
I got all I need
when I got you and I

01:42:35.399 --> 01:42:38.401
'Cause I look around me
and see your sweet life

01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:41.571
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight

01:42:41.739 --> 01:42:44.699
You're getting me
through the night

01:42:45.076 --> 01:42:47.911
Kick start my heart
when you shine it in my eyes

01:42:48.079 --> 01:42:51.081
I can't lie
It's a sweet life

01:42:51.249 --> 01:42:54.042
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight

01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:56.211
You're gettin' me
through the night

01:42:56.295 --> 01:42:58.255
We belong

01:42:58.589 --> 01:43:00.006
'Cause you're my flashlight

01:43:00.091 --> 01:43:01.424
'Cause you are

01:43:01.592 --> 01:43:03.093
'Cause you're my flashlight

01:43:03.261 --> 01:43:04.761
'Cause you're my flashlight

01:43:04.971 --> 01:43:06.596
I'm your flashlight

01:43:06.764 --> 01:43:09.599
You're gettin' me
through the night

01:43:12.603 --> 01:43:13.979
'Cause you're my flashlight

01:43:14.146 --> 01:43:16.231
'Cause you're my

01:43:19.277 --> 01:43:21.152
Gettin' me through the

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:23.780
Night

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:29.160
Whoo!

01:43:40.673 --> 01:43:44.175
"Simple," "raw,"
"vulnerable," "exposed."

01:43:44.343 --> 01:43:47.596
I've been called a lot of things, Gail.
But let me add one more.

01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.889
I'm impressed.

01:43:48.973 --> 01:43:50.974
I thought you were
gonna say "gay."

01:43:51.475 --> 01:43:52.475
Emily!
Yeah!

01:43:53.102 --> 01:43:54.185
Emily!

01:43:54.353 --> 01:43:56.521
Emily! Emily!

01:43:58.816 --> 01:44:00.775
Whoo! Whoo!

01:44:01.652 --> 01:44:03.778
Bellas! Bellas! Bellas!

01:44:07.325 --> 01:44:10.660
Bellas! Bellas! Bellas!

01:44:10.828 --> 01:44:14.039
Oh. They have touched
every person here.

01:44:14.123 --> 01:44:16.291
They've touched me, John.

01:44:16.459 --> 01:44:18.710
Well, everyone has
touched you, Gail,

01:44:18.878 --> 01:44:21.004
but this is something else.

01:44:39.523 --> 01:44:40.607
It's ceremonial,

01:44:40.691 --> 01:44:42.025
and you should
definitely not drink it

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:43.610
'cause it is
essentially poison.

01:44:43.694 --> 01:44:44.903
Terrible for you.
Okay.

01:44:44.987 --> 01:44:46.363
Okay.
Great.

01:44:47.365 --> 01:44:49.824
Ooh. It smells like
cherries and vanilla.

01:44:49.992 --> 01:44:51.034
Okay, repeat after me.

01:44:51.202 --> 01:44:52.869
"I..." Sing your name.

01:44:53.329 --> 01:44:54.329
I...

01:44:54.372 --> 01:44:55.455
Emily...

01:44:55.539 --> 01:44:56.665
Okay.

01:44:56.749 --> 01:44:59.668
"Promise to uphold the ideals
of a Bella woman forever."

01:44:59.835 --> 01:45:02.379
Promise to uphold the ideals
of a Bella woman forever.

01:45:02.546 --> 01:45:04.089
And that's it.
That's the end of the speech.

01:45:04.256 --> 01:45:06.549
Nothing weird
happens after that.

01:45:06.717 --> 01:45:07.884
These are for you.

01:45:08.052 --> 01:45:09.572
Don't go in the basement,
it's haunted.

01:45:10.054 --> 01:45:11.054
Wait!

01:45:11.097 --> 01:45:12.472
One last thing.

01:45:12.723 --> 01:45:14.516
Yes, every Bella
must christen the house

01:45:14.684 --> 01:45:16.393
by sliding down the staircase.

01:45:18.187 --> 01:45:19.187
Seriously?

01:45:19.355 --> 01:45:20.939
It's tradition.
Yeah.

01:45:21.107 --> 01:45:23.066
Don't worry. I'll show you.

01:45:25.569 --> 01:45:27.195
Behold!

01:45:35.413 --> 01:45:37.080
Crushed it.

01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:38.581
Good form.

01:45:39.583 --> 01:45:41.251
Now I'm ready to move on.

01:45:42.795 --> 01:45:44.254
Legacy, you're up.

01:45:48.342 --> 01:45:49.342
All right, I'm ready.

01:45:50.261 --> 01:45:51.428
Let's do this!

01:48:25.207 --> 01:48:26.207
Yes!

01:48:34.008 --> 01:48:35.008
You can't!

01:48:35.092 --> 01:48:38.094
You can't turn back around.
That's not part of the rules!
That's not...

01:48:38.762 --> 01:48:39.762
That bad?

01:48:49.773 --> 01:48:50.893
Thank you so much, Pharrell.

01:49:00.451 --> 01:49:01.784
Adam, turn around!

01:49:01.952 --> 01:49:04.120
Everybody's doing it, baby!
They love me!

01:49:04.288 --> 01:49:06.456
America loves me!

01:49:15.799 --> 01:49:17.342
And I give myself to you!

01:49:17.468 --> 01:49:20.011
And you! And you! And you!

01:49:20.179 --> 01:49:21.512
And you, America!

01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:24.390
Whoo!

01:49:30.481 --> 01:49:31.940
- Hey, man.
- Yes. Yes, Blake.

01:49:32.024 --> 01:49:33.149
What's your name, brother?

01:49:33.359 --> 01:49:36.069
I don't even know right now!

01:49:36.153 --> 01:49:37.403
Hey, just do me a favor, man.

01:49:37.488 --> 01:49:41.366
Please,
under no circumstances,
choose me for your coach.

01:49:41.492 --> 01:49:43.618
I just want to put that out there.
Okay.

01:49:43.702 --> 01:49:47.163
So, you have a lot of personality.
And I love that.

01:49:47.539 --> 01:49:48.790
Thank you.

01:49:48.958 --> 01:49:51.834
You're interesting,
and I can work with interesting.

01:49:53.796 --> 01:49:56.673
All of the coaches
at my disposal,

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:59.259
I'm gonna have to choose

01:49:59.343 --> 01:50:00.343
Christina!

01:50:00.928 --> 01:50:01.928
Whoo!

01:50:03.013 --> 01:50:04.013
Yay!

01:50:05.307 --> 01:50:06.391
This is awesome!

01:50:06.475 --> 01:50:07.600
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

01:50:07.685 --> 01:50:09.060
Oh, my God.

01:50:09.561 --> 01:50:11.562
Whoa! Okay, okay, okay.

01:50:11.647 --> 01:50:13.189
Thank you.
Okay.

01:50:13.857 --> 01:50:15.566
Thank you so much.

01:50:15.818 --> 01:50:17.735
Aah! Besties!

01:50:17.903 --> 01:50:19.988
Hey, Mom! Hey.

01:50:20.155 --> 01:50:21.531
Hey, Amy!
