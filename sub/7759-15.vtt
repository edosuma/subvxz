01:30.358 --> 01:31.659
- GOOD? HE'S PRACTICALLY
A SUPERHERO.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.127
ALL HE NEEDS IS
A SPANDEX BODYSUIT

01:33.161 --> 01:34.762
AND HE'S READY
TO SAVE THE UNIVERSE.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.530

HOW'S THAT?

01:36.564 --> 01:38.632

01:53.447 --> 01:54.815
BUT HE DOES NEED
A SUPERPOWER.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.688
THAT RADIATE FROM HIS DARK,
SMOLDERING BEDROOM EYES?

TO GET OUT, HAVE SOME FUN.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.530
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.733
MAYBE IF GEORGE WERE
STILL HERE TO ENJOY IT WITH ME,

03:52.766 --> 03:56.304
I MIGHT CONSIDER IT.

03:56.337 --> 03:59.006
BESIDES, I STILL HAVE A LOT
OF THINGS TO DO, YOU KNOW,

03:59.039 --> 04:00.541
AND...

04:00.574 --> 04:03.577
LIKE, FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO SAY AT HIS FUNERAL.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.313
- YOU PLAN ON SPEAKING?

04:05.346 --> 04:08.015

I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW
HOW WONDERFUL HE WAS,

04:10.551 --> 04:13.321
WHAT WE SHARED.

04:13.354 --> 04:18.992
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
I STILL NEED TO SAY GOODBYE.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.962
NEVER REALLY HAD THE CHANCE.

04:23.797 --> 04:28.302
- WELL...

04:28.336 --> 04:32.306
THEN YOU SHOULD.

04:32.340 --> 04:36.610
[indistinct chatter]

04:39.647 --> 04:41.415
- YOU TWO LOOK LIKE SHIT.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.950
- WHY DON'T YOU?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.485
- E-MAN SAVED ME.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.755
JESUS, YOU DIDN'T
KEEP THAT?

04:47.788 --> 04:50.758
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.826
- MUST BE THE DRUGS TALKING.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.696
- NO, IT'S ME,
AND IT GOT ME THINKING.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.631
- [scoffs]
THAT'S ALWAYS A DANGEROUS SIGN.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.466
- DO YOU MIND?
I'M TRYING TO HAVE

04:58.499 --> 05:00.934
A CONVERSATION
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.803
AFTER THEY KILLED OFF
CAPTAIN ASTRO,

05:02.836 --> 05:04.705
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMING
INTO MY COMIC BOOK STORE

05:04.738 --> 05:06.940
LOOKING FOR A GAY SUPERHERO,
YOU KNOW, TO TAKE HIS PLACE,

05:06.974 --> 05:08.742
BUT HE DOESN'T EXIST.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.611
THAT'S WHEN IT CAME TO ME.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.346
WHY WAIT FOR SOMEONE ELSE
TO CREATE HIM?

05:12.380 --> 05:14.948
WHY DON'T WE JUST
CREATE HIM OURSELVES?

05:14.982 --> 05:16.417
- YOU MEAN, DO OUR OWN COMIC?

05:16.450 --> 05:17.618
- WHY NOT?

05:17.651 --> 05:20.388
- OKAY, IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR MEDICATION.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.823
- WHAT--
PEOPLE MAKE THEIR OWN FILMS,

05:22.856 --> 05:25.092
THEY WRITE BOOKS
AND SCREENPLAYS.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.827
WHY IS IT SO CRAZY?

05:26.860 --> 05:28.796
- WELL FOR ONE THING, I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT COMICS.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.897
- I DO.
IT'S MY BUSINESS.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.365
I'VE BEEN READING THEM
ALL MY LIFE.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.433
I COULD COME UP
WITH A MILLION STORIES,

05:32.466 --> 05:33.801
EXCEPT I CAN'T DRAW
FOR SHIT.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.837
YOU CAN.

05:39.039 --> 05:42.610
- WOULD BE KIND OF COOL.

05:42.643 --> 05:46.780
- WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET
TOGETHER AND JUST BRAINSTORM?

05:46.814 --> 05:48.115
- YEAH.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.551
I GUESS WE COULD
GIVE IT A TRY.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.420
- FINALLY, YOU TWO BOYS WILL
HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON

05:52.453 --> 05:53.454
BESIDES ME.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.722
AND WHAT A RELIEF

05:54.755 --> 05:58.659
NOT TO BE THE CENTER
OF EVERYONE'S UNIVERSE.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.727
- [laughs]

05:59.760 --> 06:01.829
[imitates flying whoosh,
laser blast]

06:01.862 --> 06:04.765
- [moans in agony]

06:04.798 --> 06:07.435
- I GOT YOU.
DON'T WORRY.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.002
OKAY, ONE MORE STEP.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.172
OH, THAT'S IT.
- [whines]

06:12.205 --> 06:14.141
- ALL RIGHT.

06:14.174 --> 06:17.878
OKAY.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.180
OPEN YOUR EYES.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.782
- WOW.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.917
UH...
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

06:23.951 --> 06:25.653
- [laughs]

06:25.686 --> 06:26.920
MY NEW STUDIO.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.122
OR AT LEAST THE WAY
I'VE IMAGINED IT, SEE?

06:29.156 --> 06:30.624
I'VE MARKED WHERE
EVERYTHING SHOULD BE--

06:30.658 --> 06:34.962
THE SINK,
THE SHELVES...

06:34.995 --> 06:37.097
- OH. IS THAT--
IS THAT A SKYLIGHT?

06:37.130 --> 06:38.732
- IT'LL GIVE THE PLACE
A NICE, LIGHT, AIRY FEEL,

06:38.766 --> 06:39.600
DON'T YOU THINK?

06:39.633 --> 06:41.602
- I THINK IT'LL
GIVE OUR BANK ACCOUNT

06:41.635 --> 06:43.437
A NICE, LIGHT,
AIRY FEEL TOO.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.572
- HEY, ANYBODY HERE?

06:44.605 --> 06:47.908
- IN THE ATTIC!
- THE STUDIO.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.043
I KNOW MONEY'S AN ISSUE,

06:50.077 --> 06:51.779
WHICH IS WHY
I'VE DONE MY RESEARCH.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.447
I'VE PRICED
ALL THE MATERIALS.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.548
- WHAT ABOUT THE PLUMBERS,

06:54.582 --> 06:56.183
ELECTRICIANS,
CARPENTERS--

06:56.216 --> 06:57.685
UH, SKYLIGHT GUYS?

06:57.718 --> 06:59.052
- NEW FAN BELT'S HERE.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.654
IF YOU CAN SPARE YOUR WHEELS,

07:00.688 --> 07:02.656
I'LL POP IT IN RIGHT NOW.

07:02.690 --> 07:03.791
[chuckles]

07:03.824 --> 07:06.527
WHOA.
KILLER SPACE.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.895
- IT'S GOING TO BE
MY NEW STUDIO.

07:07.928 --> 07:08.929
- COOL.

07:08.962 --> 07:09.930
- LEEDS, YOU KNOW RENO.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.465
CAN YOU PRICE THIS?

07:11.499 --> 07:14.468
- HMM.
WELL...

07:14.502 --> 07:17.471
IF YOU USE A CONTRACTOR...

07:17.505 --> 07:19.139
MY GUESSTIMATE'S TEN.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.141
BUT THEN, THEY ALWAYS SAY
TO DOUBLE IT.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.209
- [whistle]

07:22.242 --> 07:23.811
THAT'S A SIZEABLE
CHUNK OF CHANGE.

07:23.844 --> 07:24.945
TOO SIZEABLE.

07:24.978 --> 07:29.950
- UNLESS, OF COURSE,
I DO IT FOR YOU.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.218
- OH, WE COULDN'T
POSSIBLY ASK THAT.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.986
- WHO'S ASKING?
I'M OFFERING.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.222
- YEAH, IT STILL SOUNDS
LIKE IT'LL COST A BUNDLE.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.224
- IT JUST SO HAPPENS THE DYKES
I'M HOUSE-SITTING FOR

07:37.257 --> 07:38.892
ARE BACK FROM
THEIR CLEANSING IN INDIA,

07:38.926 --> 07:40.861
AND THAT I'M GOING
TO NEED A PLACE TO CRASH.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.663
- AND WE HAVE A COUCH.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.165
- I GET A ROOF OVER MY HEAD,
COMPLETE WITH SKYLIGHT,

07:45.198 --> 07:48.769
AND IN EXCHANGE,
YOU GET YOUR STUDIO.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.508
- WELL, I THINK IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE PERFECT SOLUTION.

07:54.542 --> 07:57.244
- EXCEPT, AS YOU KNOW,

07:57.277 --> 08:01.582
AN ARTIST'S STUDIO
IS A PRIVATE, PERSONAL SPACE.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.117
I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE
TO CREATE IT FOR MYSELF.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.120
SO, THANK YOU
FOR THE OFFER, LEDA, BUT...

08:07.154 --> 08:09.590
NO, THANKS.

08:09.623 --> 08:14.928
- WELL, WHEN DO WE START
ACCIDENTALLY LOSING FINGERS?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.564
- HOW ABOUT THIS?

08:16.597 --> 08:19.199
A YOUNG SCIENTIST IS DOING
AN EXPERIMENT IN RADIATION

08:19.232 --> 08:21.168
WHEN HE GETS--
- BITTEN BY A RADIOACTIVE BUG?

08:21.201 --> 08:23.270
- YEAH!
- THAT'S SPIDER-MAN.

08:23.303 --> 08:26.239
- OH.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.110
KING OF THE SEAS.
HE BREATHES--

08:30.143 --> 08:32.012
- UNDERWATER.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.181
THAT'S AQUAMAN.

08:34.214 --> 08:37.885
- ARGH!

08:37.918 --> 08:39.953
OKAY, I KNOW, I GOT IT.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.789
- HE'S SENT TO EARTH
BY HIS PARENTS

08:41.822 --> 08:44.257
WHEN HE'S JUST A BABY RIGHT
BEFORE HIS PLANET EXPLODES.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.126
WHEN HE GETS HERE, HE DISCOVERS
HE HAS ALL THESE SUPERPOWERS.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.896
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

08:48.929 --> 08:49.863
- WELL, THEN,
YOU THINK OF SOMETHING.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.299
YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH A MILLION GREAT IDEAS.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.300
- WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
THEY'VE ALL

08:53.333 --> 08:54.868
BEEN PREVIOUSLY
THOUGHT OF.

08:54.902 --> 08:55.969
- WELL, MAYBE
WE SHOULD JUST FORGET IT.

08:56.003 --> 08:59.072
- NO, IT--
IT'LL COME TO US, I KNOW.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.741
- WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
FOR HOURS.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.710
- YOU CAN'T RUSH
A BRILLIANT IDEA.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.044
- [scoffs]

09:04.077 --> 09:05.178

[treadmill beeping]

09:10.383 --> 09:15.589
[footfalls]

09:15.623 --> 09:17.057
- YOU KNOW,
WHOEVER OUR GUY IS,

09:17.090 --> 09:18.225
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

09:18.258 --> 09:20.794
YOUR STANDARD
SUPERHERO STEROID CASE.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.763
- IT'S HIS MIND
THAT MAKES HIM SEXY.

09:22.796 --> 09:23.831
- IT'S HIS
FIERCE INDIVIDUALISM...

09:23.864 --> 09:24.932
- THAT GIVES HIM COURAGE.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.000
- HIS UNCOMPROMISING
MORAL CODE...

09:27.034 --> 09:28.802
- THAT MAKES HIM STRONG!

09:28.836 --> 09:30.203
- WHAT IF HIS DISGUISE

09:30.237 --> 09:33.073
IS THAT HE'S
A COLD-HEARTED AD EXEC BY DAY...

09:33.106 --> 09:35.976
- DEFENDER OF QUEERS BY NIGHT.
- [laughs]

09:36.009 --> 09:38.078
- NOW, ALL WE NEED
IS A NAME.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.781
- OKAY.

09:40.814 --> 09:41.782
[smack]

09:41.815 --> 09:42.916
- FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!

09:42.950 --> 09:43.917
[clatter]

09:43.951 --> 09:46.386
[both laugh]

09:46.419 --> 09:49.589
- THE FURY?
- PISSED-OFF MAN.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.828
- RAGE.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.163
- * MY LOVE IS DEEP

09:56.196 --> 09:58.966
- IT'S GENIUS!

09:58.999 --> 10:01.969
[funky music]

10:02.002 --> 10:03.671
*

10:03.704 --> 10:04.972
- ONCE YOU'VE CLEARED THIS,

10:05.005 --> 10:06.373
YOU CAN WORK ON
THOSE PIECES OVER THERE.

10:06.406 --> 10:10.110
- YES, SIR.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.845
- MR. HONEYCUTT,

10:11.879 --> 10:16.684
PLEASE ACCEPT
MY MOST SINCERE CONDOLENCES.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.986
- THANK YOU, JONATHAN.
AND MINE TO YOU.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.721
I, UH--
I CAN'T IMAGINE

10:20.754 --> 10:22.656
HOW GEORGE WILL MANAGE
UP THERE WITHOUT YOU.

10:22.690 --> 10:25.258
- HE'S IN FAR
MORE CAPABLE HANDS NOW.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.394
I EXPECT YOU'VE COME
FOR YOUR THINGS.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.862
ALLOW ME TO GET THEM
FOR YOU.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.431
- ACTUALLY,
I'D PREFER TO DO IT MYSELF.

10:31.464 --> 10:35.135
I'D, UH--I'D LIKE TO BE
IN HIS ROOM ONE LAST TIME.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.738
AND, UH--AND I WAS
KIND OF HOPING TO, UH,

10:37.771 --> 10:40.040
TAKE A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER HIM BY:

10:40.073 --> 10:43.010
HIS, UH, HIS SNUGGLY
OLD RED CARDIGAN.

10:43.043 --> 10:47.848
- JONATHAN, GO GET
MR. SCHICKEL'S SWEATER.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.123
- I'M SO SORRY,
MRS. SCHICKEL.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.992
I KNOW GEORGE'S PASSING
MUST BE A TREMENDOUS LOSS.

10:59.026 --> 11:03.864
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'LL MANAGE TO FILL THE VOID.

11:03.897 --> 11:07.034
CAREFUL WITH THAT.
IT'S VERY VALUABLE.

11:07.067 --> 11:11.872
- I'M SURE
YOU'LL FIND A WAY.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.775
- NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
THERE'S SO MUCH I HAVE TO DO.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.143
- I CAN IMAGINE.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.711
BACK HOME,
WHEN SOMEONE PASSED AWAY,

11:17.745 --> 11:20.113
MY MOTHER AND AUNT LULAH
WERE COOKING FOR DAYS.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.716
- COOKING?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.417
- W-WELL, INSTEAD OF
MAKING THE FUNERAL

11:24.451 --> 11:26.053
INTO A MOURNFUL OCCASION,

11:26.086 --> 11:28.221
WE TRIED TO TURN IT INTO
A CELEBRATION

11:28.255 --> 11:30.323
OF OUR LOVED ONE'S LIFE.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.927
THAT'S, UH, THAT'S WHAT I PLAN
TO DO AT GEORGE'S SERVICE.

11:33.961 --> 11:38.932
- WELL, THAT'S VERY SWEET,
BUT REALLY, IT'S NOT NECESSARY.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.801
- IT'S NECESSARY FOR ME.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.836
- WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE WON'T BE TIME.

11:42.870 --> 11:47.040
YOU SEE, GEORGE
WAS A VERY IMPORTANT MAN.

11:47.074 --> 11:50.343
THERE'LL BE MANY...
PROMINENT SPEAKERS TOMORROW,

11:50.377 --> 11:56.116
CEOs, POLITICAL
AND SPIRITUAL LEADERS.

11:56.149 --> 12:00.120
OH, HERE'S THE SWEATER
YOU REQUESTED.

12:02.222 --> 12:06.960
TAKE IT,
ALONG WITH YOUR MEMORIES.

12:06.994 --> 12:10.964
I'M SURE THEY'LL
GIVE YOU GREAT COMFORT.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.549
- I WANT HIM TO HAVE
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LOOK,

12:29.582 --> 12:31.351
LIKE NO ONE'S
EVER SEEN BEFORE.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.986
- AND DIFFERENT STORIES,
YOU KNOW?

12:33.020 --> 12:34.888
NOT JUST THE SAME OLD STUFF
YOU SEE IN STRAIGHT COMICS.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.124
YOU KNOW, OUR GUY'S GAY.
HE LIVES IN A GAY WORLD.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.859
- HE HAS GAY SEX.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.261
- AND WITH HIS SUPERPOWERS,
PLENTY OF IT.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.964
- SO, WHAT KIND OF STORIES?

12:43.997 --> 12:46.399
- WELL, THERE WAS THIS ONE STORY
I WAS THINKING ABOUT, BUT...

12:46.433 --> 12:48.301
- WHAT?
- NEVER MIND.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.370
- WELL, COME ON, TELL ME.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.572
WE'RE PARTNERS NOW.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.573
WE GOTTA SHARE
WHAT'S ON OUR MINDS,

12:53.606 --> 12:56.810
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW DUMB.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.414
- [clears throat]

13:01.448 --> 13:04.417
I WAS THINKING RAGE
COULD SAVE THIS KID'S LIFE...

13:04.451 --> 13:07.420
AFTER HE'S BASHED.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.159
SEE, I TOLD YOU
IT WAS A DUMB IDEA.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.027
I NEVER SHOULD'VE BROUGHT IT UP.
I'M SORRY.

13:14.061 --> 13:16.463
- I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.867
- YOU DO?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.534
I MEAN,
IT'S AWFULLY PERSONAL.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.004
- WELL, THE BEST ART
USUALLY IS.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.073
BESIDES, I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.540
TROUBLE IS, NO ONE
SEEMS TO WANT TO LISTEN.

13:27.574 --> 13:31.278
I MEAN, THEY WANT TO PRETEND
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.213
- WELL, NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.

13:33.246 --> 13:36.950
- AND IT COULD BE HOW RAGE
MEETS THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.451
- I THOUGHT RAGE
DIDN'T BELIEVE IN LOVE.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.020
- HA!

13:40.053 --> 13:41.321
WE'LL LET HIM THINK THAT.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.323
- [laughs]

13:43.356 --> 13:46.626
[sultry music]

13:46.659 --> 13:49.462
- * HEY, EVERYTHING YOU DO

13:49.496 --> 13:53.066
* MAKES ME FEEL
SOMETHING NEW *

13:53.100 --> 13:56.469
* HEY, EVERYTHING YOU DO

13:56.503 --> 13:59.439
[door sliding shut]

14:01.141 --> 14:02.175
- YOU'RE UP.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.211
- LOOK AGAIN.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.947
AND YOU'RE LATE.
IT'S AFTER 3:00.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.348
- IT DOESN'T COUNT.
I WAS WITH MICHAEL.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.150
- ALL FUCKING NIGHT?

14:10.183 --> 14:11.384
- IT FELT LIKE FIVE MINUTES.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.120
AND THE STUFF WE CAME UP WITH
IS AMAZING.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.621
IT'S LIKE WE
SHARE THE SAME BRAIN.

14:14.654 --> 14:17.024
- YOU GET IT MONDAY,
WEDNESDAY, AND FRIDAY,

14:17.057 --> 14:18.358
AND HE GETS IT TUESDAY
AND THURSDAY?

14:18.391 --> 14:19.492
- HA.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.961
- WHAT'S THAT?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.362
- OH, IT'S RESEARCH.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.231
MICHAEL WANTS ME
TO STUDY THE ILLUSTRATIONS,

14:24.264 --> 14:28.101
TO SOAK IT ALL IN.

14:28.135 --> 14:30.370
CHECK OUT THIS ONE.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.073
- COME OVER HERE.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.662
[phone rings]

14:55.695 --> 14:57.965
[scoffs]

14:57.998 --> 15:00.400
[beep]

15:00.433 --> 15:01.568
WHAT?

15:01.601 --> 15:02.936
- PUT JUSTIN ON, QUICK.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.704
- IT'S FUCKING 4:00
IN THE MORNING.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.174
- CREATIVITY DOESN'T
PUNCH A TIME-CLOCK.

15:07.207 --> 15:10.277
- OH, MY GOD,
THAT IS SO PROFOUND.

15:10.310 --> 15:14.447
CAN YOU HOLD ON A MINUTE
WHILE I WRITE IT DOWN?

15:14.481 --> 15:15.682
- YOU FREAK.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.317
- I JUST GOT THIS IDEA
AND I COULDN'T WAIT.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.551
- WHAT?
QUICK, TELL ME.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.353
- MAYBE WE COULD HAVE, LIKE,
A CHIROPRACTOR AS A VILLAIN--

15:20.387 --> 15:22.555
- WHAT--
- NIGHTY-NIGHT, MIKEY.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.192
[beep]

15:25.225 --> 15:27.594
- THAT WAS IMPORTANT.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.597
- SO IS THIS.

16:03.696 --> 16:06.633
- [grunts]

16:08.068 --> 16:10.437
MMM.
[groans]

16:10.470 --> 16:13.173
THAT FEELS...

16:13.206 --> 16:17.044
GOOD.

16:29.789 --> 16:35.728
[light snoring]

16:48.508 --> 16:51.778
- [sighs]

16:51.811 --> 16:55.348
- I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
MORE REWARDING AND RELAXING

16:55.382 --> 16:57.050
THAN RENOVATING
AN OLD ATTIC.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.685
AND IT'S SO SIMPLE.

16:58.718 --> 17:02.355
YOU JUST NEED A FEW TOOLS
AND SOME WELL-CHOSEN MATERIALS,

17:02.389 --> 17:05.325
AND IN NO TIME, THAT EMPTY SPACE
WILL BE TRANSFORMED

17:05.358 --> 17:07.127
INTO A COZY LIVING AREA

17:07.160 --> 17:08.728
THAT IS SURE TO BE ONE
OF YOUR FAVORITE PLACES

17:08.761 --> 17:10.063
IN THE HOUSE.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.464
I KNOW MINE IS.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.533
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY,
IT'LL BE...

17:13.566 --> 17:15.268
[snaps fingers]
A SNAP.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.536
- WHO'S THIS CRAZY BITCH?

17:16.569 --> 17:18.071
- IT'S A REMODELING VIDEO.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.406
- THE SALESPERSON
AT THE HARDWARE STORE

17:19.439 --> 17:22.575
SAID TO FOLLOW ALONG
AND DO EXACTLY AS SHE DOES.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.677
- WELL, THEN,
YOU'VE ALREADY FUCKED UP.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.778
- HOW'S THAT?

17:25.812 --> 17:31.084
- YOU'RE NOT WEARING PEARLS.

17:31.118 --> 17:34.687
- LET'S MEASURE
OUR PLYWOOD LENGTHWISE.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.289
HERE'S A TIP
THAT I JUST LOVE--

17:36.323 --> 17:39.159
I ALWAYS KEEP A TAPE MEASURE
ON MY KEY CHAIN.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.460
THAT WAY, IF ANYTHING
REQUIRES...

17:40.493 --> 17:41.828
- UH, 'SCUSE ME, GIRLS?

17:41.861 --> 17:43.163
- HUH?

17:43.196 --> 17:44.264
- THAT'S THE WRONG WAY.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.698
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

17:45.732 --> 17:49.836
- WHEN IT COMES TO MEASURING
WOOD, I'M AN EXPERT.

17:49.869 --> 17:53.072
- YEAH, OKAY.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.745
AH.
SEE HOW EASY THIS IS?

17:58.778 --> 18:03.150
I TOLD YOU
WE DON'T NEED LEDA.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.717
- DO I DETECT A NOTE
OF JEALOUSY?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.819
- OF LEDA?
[laughs]

18:06.853 --> 18:09.122
NO, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.491
- WELL, THEN WHY THE FUCK
DIDN'T YOU LET HER HELP YOU OUT?

18:11.524 --> 18:13.860
- THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW.
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.196
WE CAN DO IT OURSELVES.
- "WE CAN DO IT OURSELVES."

18:16.229 --> 18:17.730
- [scoffs]

18:17.764 --> 18:20.667
- THERE, SEE HOW EASILY
THE PLYWOOD CUTS?

18:20.700 --> 18:22.202
THAT NICE, CLEAN EDGE.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.204
AND NEVER LET SAWDUST
GO TO WASTE.

18:24.237 --> 18:27.340
I COLLECT UP EVERY PARTICLE
AND STORE IT IN THE FREEZER.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.409
IN THE SPRING,
I'LL MIX IT WITH FRESH SOIL

18:29.442 --> 18:31.611
AND HAVE AN INTERESTING
AND INEXPENSIVE MULCH

18:31.644 --> 18:32.612
FOR MY GARDEN.

18:32.645 --> 18:33.680
[saw whirs]
- [screams]

18:33.713 --> 18:35.182
HEY, HEY, WHOA!

18:35.215 --> 18:36.149
HEY, WATCH WHERE
YOU POINT THAT THING.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.918
- YES, YES!
- WHAT KIND OF A DYKE ARE YOU?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.487
YOU CAN'T EVEN HANDLE
A POWER TOOL?

18:40.520 --> 18:42.689
- OH, GO AWAY
AND PLAY WITH YOUR SON.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.324
- WHILE YOU'VE STILL
GOT YOUR LEGS.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.725
- YEAH, YEAH.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.527
DON'T WE PUT IT OVER THERE?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.662
- GO WITH THE LINES.
WE MARKED IT ALREADY.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.232
- [snaps fingers]
IT'S A SNAP.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.934
- GEORGE LOVED HIS CITY.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.636
HE LOVED HIS COMPANY.

18:56.669 --> 19:00.307
BUT MOST OF ALL,
HE LOVED HIS FAMILY.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.908
I'M REMINDED
OF A STORY THAT HE

19:01.941 --> 19:05.778
AND HIS DEVOTED WIFE, VIRGINIA,
ONCE RELAYED TO ME.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.915
ONE DAY, THEIR DAUGHTER FRANKIE
CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL,

19:08.948 --> 19:11.518
UPSET TO HAVE LEARNED
OF HUNGRY CHILDREN,

19:11.551 --> 19:12.952
VICTIMS OF AN EARTHQUAKE
IN SOUTH AMERICA...

19:12.985 --> 19:15.422
- THIS IS SOME EVENT.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.390
EVERYBODY
WHO'S ANYBODY'S HERE.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.392
- YEAH, EVERYBODY WHO DIDN'T
WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH GEORGE

19:19.426 --> 19:21.294
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.530
ALL THE MORE REASON
I'M GLAD I CAME.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.797
LET'S FIND A SEAT.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.866
- A FAMILY MAN
CARING FOR FAMILIES.

19:26.899 --> 19:30.770
THAT'S WHAT GEORGE SCHICKEL
WAS ALL ABOUT.

19:30.803 --> 19:34.741
AND I, FOR ONE,
WILL MISS HIM DEEPLY.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.414
- WE'VE HEARD MANY TRIBUTES
TO GEORGE SCHICKEL

19:41.448 --> 19:43.383
THIS AFTERNOON.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.553
IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT THIS MUCH BELOVED MAN

19:46.586 --> 19:49.256
NOT ONLY BROUGHT NOURISHMENT
TO THE WORLD...

19:49.289 --> 19:50.189
- GO ON.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.624
- THROUGH THE PICKLE
THE PEOPLE PREFER...

19:51.658 --> 19:52.425
- NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.294
- BUT ALSO
EMOTIONAL NOURISHMENT...

19:54.327 --> 19:55.094
- JUST DO IT.

19:55.127 --> 19:58.298
- TO HIS FAMILY,
TO HIS COMMUNITY,

19:58.331 --> 19:59.732
INDEED TO ALL
OF PITTSBURGH.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.302
- UM, I'D LIKE
TO SAY SOMETHING.

20:02.335 --> 20:06.439
[crowd murmuring]

20:09.376 --> 20:11.778
- SORRY, SIR, IT'S FOR FRIENDS
AND FAMILY ONLY.

20:11.811 --> 20:15.415
- I AM A FRIEND.
I'M MORE THAN A FRIEND.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.284
T-TAKE YOUR--
LET GO OF ME!

20:17.317 --> 20:18.084
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
LOOK, ALL RIGHT,

20:18.117 --> 20:19.952
JUST TAKE YOUR HANDS
OFF OF HIM!

20:19.986 --> 20:21.454
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
- TEDDY!

20:21.488 --> 20:24.291
- JUST TAKE YOUR HANDS
OFF OF HIM!

20:24.324 --> 20:27.727
- WILL EVERYONE PLEASE RISE
FOR THE 23rd PSALM?

20:27.760 --> 20:30.363
- * EVERY DAY'S A PARTY

20:30.397 --> 20:32.732
* EVERY DAY'S A PARTY

20:32.765 --> 20:34.967
* EVERY DAY'S A PARTY

20:35.001 --> 20:37.770
* GOTTA PARTY EVERY DAY

20:37.804 --> 20:40.440
* EVERY DAY'S A PARTY

20:40.473 --> 20:42.809
* EVERY DAY'S A PARTY

20:42.842 --> 20:45.044
* EVERY DAY'S A PARTY

20:45.077 --> 20:46.279
* GOTTA PARTY EVERY DAY

20:46.313 --> 20:47.847
- ALL RIGHT.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.349
GOOD--WAIT.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.951
COULD YOU MAKE HIS JAW
A LITTLE WIDER?

20:51.984 --> 20:53.453
[laughs]

20:53.486 --> 20:54.854
THAT'S PERFECT.
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE--

20:54.887 --> 20:58.325
- EXCUSE ME, HAS ANYONE SEEN
MY FUCKING FLOOR?

20:58.358 --> 20:59.892
- UH-OH!
DON'T GET HIM MAD.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.828
- YEAH, OR HE'LL EMIT
HIS TELEKINETIC DEATH STARE

21:01.861 --> 21:03.029
AND MAKE YOUR HEAD EXPLODE.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.064
- [chuckles]

21:05.097 --> 21:06.499
THAT'S ONE OF HIS POWERS.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.900
HE CAN CONTROL YOUR MIND
WHENEVER HE WANTS.

21:07.934 --> 21:13.640
- YEAH, WELL,
WHAT I WANT IS MY LOFT.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.542
- WAIT, DON'T TOUCH THOSE.
- HEY, THOSE ARE IN SEQUENCE!

21:15.575 --> 21:16.743
DON'T WALK THAT WAY.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.745
- WELL, HOW THE HELL AM I
SUPPOSED TO GET TO MY BEDROOM?

21:18.778 --> 21:20.313
- GO AROUND.
- YEAH.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.781
- UH-HUH.

21:21.814 --> 21:24.951
HEY!

21:24.984 --> 21:26.919
- [sighs]

21:26.953 --> 21:29.055
SO HERE IS WHERE ZEPHYR
TRIES TO STOP RAGE

21:29.088 --> 21:30.657
FROM USING
HIS HETERO-BLASTER.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.725
DO YOU THINK ZEPHYR
COULD BE A LITTLE TALLER

21:32.759 --> 21:34.427
AND HAVE BIGGER PECS?

21:34.461 --> 21:35.862
- WHAT FOR?

21:35.895 --> 21:37.530
- WELL,
HE IS RAGE'S BEST FRIEND.

21:37.564 --> 21:40.032
HE'S--HE SHOULD LOOK
ALMOST AS GOOD.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.469
- YOU GOT IT, ZEPH.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.770
- YOU KNOW,
SPEAKING OF PECS,

21:43.803 --> 21:46.406
IT'S "CHEST OF DEATH" NIGHT
AT BABYLON.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.741
- MM-HMM.
- OKAY.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.109
- SO GET READY.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.844
- WE GOTTA FINISH THIS FIRST.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.013
- WE'LL MEET YOU THERE.

21:54.046 --> 21:55.815
- WELL, JUST REMEMBER,
ALL WORK AND NO DICK

21:55.848 --> 21:59.018
MAKE MIKEY AND SUNSHINE
DULL BOYS.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.587
[cheers and applause]

22:00.620 --> 22:02.088
- BRING IT DOWN,
BRING IT DOWN, BRING IT DOWN.

22:02.121 --> 22:06.493
OKAY, WE'RE DOWN
TO OUR SIX FINALISTS.

22:06.526 --> 22:10.430
WHO'S THE MAN WITH
THE HOTTEST PECS IN PITTSBURGH?

22:10.463 --> 22:12.599
OOH. HONEY,

22:12.632 --> 22:15.568
ARE THOSE NIPPLES
OR BATHTUB STOPPERS?

22:15.602 --> 22:17.804
[laughter]

22:17.837 --> 22:19.105
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.107
COME ON, NOW,
LET'S MAKE SOME NOISE!

22:21.140 --> 22:23.376
LET'S HEAR IT, BABYLON.
LET'S HEAR IT.

22:23.410 --> 22:24.544
THAT'S IT, YOU KNOW HOW.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.713
[cheers and applause]

22:26.746 --> 22:29.449
- TO BE THROWN OUT,
LIKE SO MUCH GARBAGE.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.550
- I KNOW, IT WAS AWFUL.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.586
- BY THOSE TWO HUGE,
BRUTAL MONSTERS.

22:33.620 --> 22:37.924
- UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES,
IT MIGHT'VE BEEN HOT.

22:37.957 --> 22:41.594
- GUESS I'LL NEVER GET
TO SAY MY SPEECH NOW.

22:41.628 --> 22:44.130
- YOU CAN SAY IT TO ME.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.766
I'LL LISTEN.

22:46.799 --> 22:50.470
- THANKS, TEDDY, I--

22:50.503 --> 22:54.040
WOULDN'T BE THE SAME.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.108
- EM...

22:56.142 --> 22:58.778
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
WE'VE BEEN STOOD UP.

22:58.811 --> 23:01.948
- OVER A COMIC BOOK.

23:01.981 --> 23:05.485
- MORE THAN JUST A COMIC BOOK.

23:05.518 --> 23:08.588
THERE'S NOTHING AS SEXUAL
AS THE ACT OF CREATION.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.957
WHEN I--WHEN I'M WRITING,
AND IT'S--

23:10.990 --> 23:13.059
IT'S POURING OUT OF ME,

23:13.092 --> 23:15.828
I SWEAR TO GOD, I'M LIKE,
COMPLETELY TURNED ON.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.164
SOMETIMES, I EVEN
GET A HARD-ON.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.633
- IS THAT WHAT THEY MEAN
BY "STROKE OF GENIUS"?

23:20.667 --> 23:23.803
- IT'S THE FUCKING
GREATEST ORGASM THERE IS.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.738
- YOU HAVE YOUR ORGASMS
BETWEEN THE PAGES,

23:25.772 --> 23:27.073
I'LL HAVE MINE
BETWEEN THE SHEETS.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.675
- NUMBER FIVE,

23:28.708 --> 23:31.210
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D
LIKE TO GET OFF YOUR CHEST?

23:31.243 --> 23:32.645
HOW ABOUT ME?

23:32.679 --> 23:35.615
[laughter]

23:35.648 --> 23:37.650
- I BET IT'S THE SAME
WITH MICHAEL AND JUSTIN.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.085
- CAN I HEAR A LITTLE NOISE
FROM OVER HERE?

23:39.118 --> 23:40.086
- WHAT THEY'RE SHARING

23:40.119 --> 23:44.524
IS THE MOST INTENSE FORM
OF INTIMACY THERE IS.

23:44.557 --> 23:45.925
NOTHING, NOT EVEN
THE HOTTEST FUCK IN THE WORLD,

23:45.958 --> 23:47.594
CAN COME CLOSE.

23:47.627 --> 23:50.630
- OKAY, NOW...
SWEETIE...

23:50.663 --> 23:53.065
- SO HOW ABOUT ANOTHER DRINK,

23:53.099 --> 23:54.901
WHILE OUR BOYFRIENDS
ARE CHEATING ON US.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.803
- WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE
HIM TALK, DON'T WORRY.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.938
NOW, COME ON, BOYS.
NOW LET'S MAKE SOME NOISE.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.741
COME ON, BABYLON.
TAKE IT UP, COME ON.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.510
THAT'S IT, BRING IT UP.

24:03.543 --> 24:04.977
- SEE?

24:05.011 --> 24:07.614
I TOLD YOU WE COULD DO IT.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.616
- YEAH, WE DID IT ALL RIGHT.

24:09.649 --> 24:10.783
IT'S A MESS.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.251
- IT'S NOT SO BAD.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.953
AFTER WE PLASTER IT OVER,

24:13.986 --> 24:17.857
THE FEW LITTLE IMPERFECTIONS
WON'T EVEN SHOW.

24:20.727 --> 24:23.663
[clears throat]

24:24.864 --> 24:26.599
- INSTALLING YOUR NEW SINK
WILL BE...

24:26.633 --> 24:27.734
[snaps fingers]
A SNAP.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.836
- EVERYTHING WITH THIS BITCH
IS A SNAP.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.270
- WE'VE ALREADY ATTACHED IT
TO THE WALL,

24:31.303 --> 24:33.005
AND IT ONLY TOOK
20 MINUTES.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.107
- TRY 7 HOURS AND 20 MINUTES.

24:35.141 --> 24:38.878
- NOW, LET'S CONNECT THE SINK
TO OUR PIPES.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.246
- TAKE YOUR WRENCH...
GOT IT.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.682
- AND IN A STRONG,
CIRCULAR MOTION,

24:42.715 --> 24:45.752
TWIST THE END OF THE PIPE,
LIKE SO.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.154
THAT'S IT.
GIVE IT A NICE STRONG GRIP.

24:48.187 --> 24:52.525
YOU'LL FIND THIS--
- MEL, CAN YOU HELP ME OUT HERE?

24:54.160 --> 24:56.563
- NOW WE CAN ATTACH OUR PIPES.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.931
IT'S A SNAP.
- [ grunts]

24:58.965 --> 25:00.700
[both screaming]

25:00.733 --> 25:03.670
- LUCKILY, WE TURNED OFF
THE WATER MAIN FIRST,

25:03.703 --> 25:06.005
OR WE'D HAVE A DISASTER
ON OUR HANDS.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.273
- DIDN'T YOU TURN OFF
THE WATER?

25:07.306 --> 25:09.108
- I WAS GOING TO,

25:09.141 --> 25:11.143
BUT THEN YOU SAID,
"NO, I'LL TURN IT OFF."

25:11.177 --> 25:12.912
- NO, THAT WAS THE POWER.

25:12.945 --> 25:15.014
I TURNED OFF THE POWER
WHEN I DID THE WIRING.

25:15.047 --> 25:19.986
- YOU MEAN, WHEN YOU
BLEW OUT THE FUSES!

25:20.019 --> 25:23.189
- THERE, NOW YOU HAVE
RUNNING WATER IN YOUR ATTIC.

25:30.963 --> 25:34.634
- COME ON IN.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.703
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A LITTLE CONTEST OF OUR OWN.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.304
- SOME POWER PECS?

25:38.337 --> 25:39.606
- POWER PECKERS.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.140
- [laughs]

25:41.173 --> 25:42.809
- CAREFUL, DON'T--
DON'T STEP ON ANYTHING.

25:42.842 --> 25:46.813
IT--IT'S ALL IN SEQUENCE.

25:49.215 --> 25:53.185
RISE AND SHINE, SUNSHINE.

26:03.329 --> 26:06.332
SHIT.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.935
- GO DOWN, GO DOWN.
YEAH.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.236
MM-HMM, THAT'S RIGHT.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.671
- PARTY'S OVER.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.372
- COME ON, JOIN US.
- THE PARTY'S OVER.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.207
GET YOUR CLOTHES ON.
PUT YOUR CLOTHES BACK ON!

26:15.241 --> 26:16.308
- WHAT THE FUCK?
WHAT THE FUCK?

26:16.342 --> 26:18.978
- JUST GET OUT, OKAY?

26:19.011 --> 26:20.613
GET OUT!

26:20.647 --> 26:23.616
GO!
- FUCK YOU.

26:23.650 --> 26:26.619
[intense music]

26:26.653 --> 26:28.688
*

26:28.721 --> 26:30.189
FUCK, FUCK!

26:30.222 --> 26:38.164
*

27:03.155 --> 27:04.957
[relieved sigh]

27:04.991 --> 27:09.729
*

27:09.762 --> 27:11.430
[laughs]
FUCK.

27:11.463 --> 27:15.301
*

27:15.334 --> 27:17.303
[relieved sigh]

27:17.336 --> 27:21.007
*

27:21.040 --> 27:23.009
- [sighs]

27:36.355 --> 27:39.726
[sighs]

27:39.759 --> 27:42.261
- WHAT THE FUCK?

27:42.294 --> 27:43.963
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE BEN.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.766
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE BRIAN.

27:46.799 --> 27:50.903
- I GUESS WE FELL ASLEEP.
- YEAH.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.939
BRIAN?

27:52.972 --> 27:56.776
- HE MUST'VE SLEPT
ON THE COUCH.

28:00.279 --> 28:03.382
- MICHAEL.

28:09.088 --> 28:12.058
- HOLY SHIT!

28:29.375 --> 28:30.442
DID YOU DO THIS?

28:30.476 --> 28:32.779
- DID YOU?

28:32.812 --> 28:35.948
- ANSWER US.

28:35.982 --> 28:38.050
- YOU ARE TOTALLY FUCKED.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.319
- HOW DARE YOU
PISS ON OUR WORK?

28:40.352 --> 28:41.520
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

28:41.553 --> 28:43.222
THE HOURS
THAT WE PUT INTO THAT?

28:43.255 --> 28:44.857
- WE WANT AN EXPLANATION.

28:44.891 --> 28:48.227
- BESIDES THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST PRICK.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.528
- WELL,
DON'T JUST SIT THERE!

28:49.561 --> 28:52.731
- SAY SOMETHING.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.809
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

29:02.842 --> 29:04.977
ONE LAST THING.

29:05.011 --> 29:08.147
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S PATHETIC.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.055
- GIVE ME A MINUTE
BETWEEN ROUNDS,

29:16.088 --> 29:18.124
THEN YOU CAN HAVE A GO
AT ME.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.960
- ARTICLE 14
OF THE SUPER-MOM HANDBOOK

29:20.993 --> 29:23.129
SAYS NO KICKING ASSHOLES
WHEN THEY'RE DOWN.

29:23.162 --> 29:25.965
THEY'D TAKE AWAY MY HALO.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.467
- I'M NOT AN ASSHOLE,
I'M JUST DRAWN THAT WAY.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.169
- WELL, I'M SORRY
TO DISAGREE WITH YOU, KIDDO,

29:30.202 --> 29:32.238
BUT THIS TIME,
THE LIKENESS IS ACCURATE.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.840
- I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO BEAT ME UP.

29:33.873 --> 29:36.042
- LET ME FINISH.

29:36.075 --> 29:39.345
BUT I UNDERSTAND.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.113
'CAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS.

29:41.147 --> 29:44.116
- I DON'T DO JEALOUS.
JEALOUS IS FOR LESBIANS.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.886
- WELL, THEN, YOU'D BETTER
START LIKING PUSSY,

29:46.919 --> 29:49.021
'CAUSE YOU GOT A LITTLE
GREEN-EYED MONSTER INSIDE YOU

29:49.055 --> 29:50.356
THAT IS EATING YOUR GUT.

29:50.389 --> 29:52.024
- YOU MEAN
THAT'S NOT THE COFFEE?

29:52.058 --> 29:53.559
- [chuckles]

29:53.592 --> 29:55.427
I FIGURED YOU'D HAVE
SOME SMART-ASS REMARK

29:55.461 --> 29:57.997
AND DENY YOUR FEELINGS
AS ALWAYS.

29:58.030 --> 30:01.300
BUT YOU DON'T FOOL ME.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.202
'CAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T
LOVE THEM AS MUCH AS YOU DO,

30:03.235 --> 30:05.137
YOU WOULDN'T GIVE A SHIT

30:05.171 --> 30:06.538
THAT THEY'RE
SPENDING TIME TOGETHER

30:06.572 --> 30:11.177
AND SHARING SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT A PART OF.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.478
WHAT YOU DON'T GET IS,

30:12.511 --> 30:14.513
THAT THEY FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU,

30:14.546 --> 30:18.050
EVEN MORE SO.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.523
THEY WORSHIP THE GROUND
YOU WALK ON,

30:24.556 --> 30:27.426
OR CAN'T YOU SEE IT?

30:27.459 --> 30:32.398
YOU'RE THEIR FUCKING HERO.

30:32.431 --> 30:35.501
AT LEAST YOU WERE.

30:38.170 --> 30:41.640
[bell chimes]

30:41.673 --> 30:45.044
[indistinct chatter]

30:45.077 --> 30:47.113
- IT'S THE NIGHT OF NIGHTS,

30:47.146 --> 30:50.449
WHAT EVERYONE IN THE INDUSTRY
HAS WAITED FOR ALL YEAR.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.618
WHEN THE GRANADA INN
IS TRANSFORMED

30:52.651 --> 30:55.287
INTO AN X-RATED XANADU.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.890
THEN, AFTER THE CEREMONIES,

30:57.924 --> 30:59.291
THERE'S THE GOVERNOR'S BALL.

30:59.325 --> 31:02.962
EVERY PORN STAR
WILL BE THERE, IN PERSON.

31:02.995 --> 31:07.399
ZACK O'TOOL, ROGER MOREHEAD,
WILL HARDIN.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.969
ONLY, THIS TIME...

31:10.002 --> 31:12.638
YOU'RE ONE OF THEM, EMMETT,

31:12.671 --> 31:17.543
THE POSSIBLE NEW-CUMMER
OF THE YEAR.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.979
- PICKLE?

31:20.012 --> 31:22.581
- DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I JUST SAID?

31:22.614 --> 31:27.219
- YOU KNOW, WHEN
I PUT GEORGE'S SWEATER ON...

31:27.253 --> 31:30.256
I FEEL LIKE HIS ARMS
ARE STILL AROUND ME.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.258
[chuckles]

31:32.291 --> 31:34.393
HIS, UH--HIS SMELL'S
STILL ON IT.

31:34.426 --> 31:37.196
THAT, UH--
THAT DELICATE COMBINATION

31:37.229 --> 31:40.566
OF VANILLA AND...
DILL.

31:40.599 --> 31:44.036
- EMMETT, GEORGE WOULDN'T
WANT YOU TO BE A HERMIT.

31:44.070 --> 31:47.506
- HE WAS ONE,
FOR YEARS.

31:47.539 --> 31:50.076
AND NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.278
- LISTEN TO ME.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.213
IF YOU LET THOSE PEOPLE
TAKE YOUR PRIDE,

31:54.246 --> 31:55.948
THEN THEY'VE WON.

31:55.982 --> 31:58.384
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER
THAT YOU GET OUT AND CELEBRATE.

EVERYTHING ON YOUR COMPUTER,

32:40.459 --> 32:42.161
OTHERWISE,
WE'D REALLY BE FUCKED.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.362

DOING A COMIC BOOK?

32:53.239 --> 32:55.341
- WELL, WE DID KIND OF
EXCLUDE HIM.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.243
- WE WERE WORKING.

32:57.276 --> 33:01.713
- IN HIS PLACE.
IN HIS FACE.

33:01.747 --> 33:04.316
LAST NIGHT,
WE EVEN WOUND UP IN HIS BED.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.318
- IT'S NOT LIKE WE
WERE FUCKING.

33:06.352 --> 33:11.490
- WELL, I GUESS EVEN A SUPERHERO
CAN MORPH INTO A JERK.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.225

YOU'RE GONNA FORGIVE HIM.

33:13.259 --> 33:14.593
- WHO SAID THAT?

33:14.626 --> 33:16.762

I'VE BEEN FOOLING MYSELF,

33:25.837 --> 33:28.307
THINKING HE LOVES ME.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.310
- HE DOES LOVE YOU.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.445
YOU SAW HIS FACE
THIS MORNING.

33:33.479 --> 33:34.813
WE COULD'VE REMOVED
HIS TEETH WITH PLIERS

33:34.846 --> 33:36.315
AND HE WOULD'VE LET US.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.718
- MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE.
HE DESERVES IT.

33:39.751 --> 33:42.254
- WELL, AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW
WHAT RAGE'S FATAL WEAKNESS IS,

33:42.288 --> 33:46.258

I NEVER WOULD'VE MET
THE MOST WONDERFUL MAN

TO THE WORLD,
GEORGE SCHICKEL WAS A MAN

36:46.872 --> 36:50.709
OF PROMINENCE AND WEALTH.

I LIKE TO THINK I BROUGHT
A LITTLE FUN INTO HIS LIFE,

37:16.735 --> 37:21.307
BUT WHAT HE GAVE ME
WAS SO MUCH MORE,

37:21.340 --> 37:25.277
SOMETHING ALL HIS MONEY
COULDN'T BUY.

37:26.912 --> 37:32.250

I LOVE YOU, GEORGIE.

WHAT WE HAD FOR A--
FOR A FEW SHORT MONTHS

IF YOU'D MADE

I'D HAVE TO DETONATE,
NOT RENOVATE.

IT'LL TAKE TO UNDO THE DAMAGE?

YOU CAN HAVE IT GOOD AND FAST,
BUT THAT WON'T BE CHEAP.

38:49.928 --> 38:53.131
OR YOU CAN HAVE IT
CHEAP AND GOOD,

38:53.164 --> 38:55.701
BUT IT WON'T BE FAST.

38:55.734 --> 38:58.103

40:38.103 --> 40:39.738
ART.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.541
BUT THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED.

YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS

WANT ME TO DO, GROVEL?

- WHAT I DID WAS IMMATURE,
CHILDISH, VINDICTIVE.

41:07.599 --> 41:10.035
IT WAS AN ACT OF CRUELTY
BASED ON IRRATIONAL FEARS

41:10.068 --> 41:12.904
AND UNFOUNDED JEALOUSY.

41:16.575 --> 41:21.046
IF I WERE THE TWO OF YOU,
I'D NEVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.
