WEBVTT

00:07.457 --> 00:12.545
He's sleepwalking into oblivion.
Uncontrolled migration,

00:12.545 --> 00:14.838
hyperinflation,
rampant crime...

00:15.506 --> 00:18.301
Here we go.
The 5 PM.

00:19.386 --> 00:20.720
- All good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

00:21.178 --> 00:23.848
Greg, considering it's my first
post-Logan election,

00:23.848 --> 00:26.518
and I have Cyd running around town,

00:26.518 --> 00:29.270
spitting poison like a fucking
king cobra with an iPhone.

00:29.270 --> 00:32.523
I have PGN to the left of me.
I have FVA to the right.

00:32.523 --> 00:35.318
I gotta deliver
the best election numbers ever,

00:35.318 --> 00:38.780
'cause my bosses want to rip my heart
out as a peace offering

00:38.780 --> 00:42.408
to all Congress. So, Greg, you know,
I'm a little bit tense.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.411
Just a little bit tense.

00:45.036 --> 00:46.746
Well, yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.

02:22.091 --> 02:23.385
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, Ken.

02:23.385 --> 02:24.802
You good? You feeling good?

02:24.802 --> 02:26.304
Needs to be gangbusters tonight,
man, yeah?

02:26.304 --> 02:27.763
Yeah, you got it. You got it.

02:27.763 --> 02:29.307
All right, need those numbers, T.

02:29.307 --> 02:31.726
Really want to see those
numbers, Tom, okay?

02:31.726 --> 02:33.937
Market's watching.
First Super Bowl.

02:33.937 --> 02:35.438
How are we gonna cope
without the king, right?

02:35.438 --> 02:39.525
Okay, got it, Ken. All good, all good.
Hey, Pam, how's it looking?

02:39.525 --> 02:40.734
A bit of crackle.

02:40.734 --> 02:44.072
We have a news van
and a bit of trouble in Oregon.

02:44.072 --> 02:45.699
Things looking fighty in Milwaukee.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.994
Did you see the viral thing about
the woman who voted,

02:48.994 --> 02:51.788
like, 40 times for Jimenez
under her dead mom's name?

02:51.788 --> 02:53.956
We tracked her down.
Not super reliable.

02:53.956 --> 02:56.001
She's not a well person.

02:56.001 --> 02:57.919
Well, you're not a doctor, Pam.

02:57.919 --> 03:00.504
Until you qualify,
why don't you get her on the air?

03:01.464 --> 03:03.382
Long night in dress shoes?

03:03.382 --> 03:06.678
Cyd used to go for these sort
of slip-ons with a padded sock.

03:06.678 --> 03:10.347
Probably 'cause she couldn't get
her cloven hooves in regular shoes.

03:11.098 --> 03:12.934
I'm perfectly comfortable, Pam.

03:12.934 --> 03:15.186
I've got good arches.
They've been remarked upon.

03:15.186 --> 03:18.564
- 5 PM exit polls. Come on.
- Hey, Darwin.

03:18.564 --> 03:21.066
You know... They're cool.

03:21.066 --> 03:23.736
You don't do anything
special tonight, do you?

03:23.736 --> 03:26.113
Just somebody who was
talking about adult diapers.

03:26.113 --> 03:28.783
I think there's always time
for the bathroom.

03:28.783 --> 03:29.826
Okay, thanks.

03:31.368 --> 03:35.582
Okay, excuse me.
Coming through, coming through here.

03:35.582 --> 03:38.752
Hey, everybody,
so terms and conditions.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.170
Forgive me, those of you
who already know this.

03:41.170 --> 03:44.006
- You get some rest, though?
- No.

03:44.006 --> 03:47.093
- Marital strife.
- Can I hear a "got it"?

03:47.093 --> 03:48.761
- Got it!
- Thank you.

03:49.261 --> 03:52.222
- How was your night?
- With Matsson? Pretty monstrous.

03:52.222 --> 03:58.271
His crew knows some unseemly
venues. I danced with an old man.

04:00.230 --> 04:02.941
He didn't want to dance,
but they made us dance.

04:02.941 --> 04:04.443
He was so confused.

04:04.944 --> 04:10.366
I drank things
that aren't normally drinks.

04:11.242 --> 04:13.994
And I got the impression...

04:15.454 --> 04:18.457
Do you know about Matsson with Shiv

04:18.457 --> 04:23.004
and their business alliance agreement?

04:25.507 --> 04:28.426
Well, I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:29.219 --> 04:32.763
Okay, I didn't think so.
You want to strategize?

04:33.264 --> 04:35.557
You want to fry her ass up?

04:35.557 --> 04:40.480
Information, Greg.
It's like a bottle of fine wine.

04:41.563 --> 04:43.440
You store it, you hoard it,

04:44.024 --> 04:45.694
you save it for a special occasion,

04:46.193 --> 04:48.862
and then you smash someone's
fucking face in one.

04:49.364 --> 04:53.535
So what we're hearing is,
and remember, this is not decisive.

04:53.535 --> 04:56.788
What we're seeing is
Mencken may be overperforming

04:56.788 --> 04:59.498
in Georgia and Arizona.

05:00.250 --> 05:05.337
So our early read would be,
"closer than polls have suggested".

05:05.337 --> 05:10.175
Close, but Jimenez likely
edging on what we've seen.

05:10.175 --> 05:12.929
Listen, this is privileged information.

05:12.929 --> 05:16.765
Leaks that suppress or encourage
turnout could result in our ejection

05:16.765 --> 05:19.560
from the national election pool, okay?

05:19.935 --> 05:21.813
You heard the man. Zip it.

05:23.565 --> 05:25.149
That's great.

05:25.941 --> 05:29.278
Okay, Tom says, "exit polls say
looks like Jimenez".

05:29.696 --> 05:32.115
- No leaks.
- That's great.

05:32.115 --> 05:34.784
I mean, I got four smileys from Gil.
They think they've got it.

05:34.784 --> 05:37.954
Well, I have got eggplant,
eggplant, flag from Mencken.

05:39.038 --> 05:42.374
Well, two eggplants is not as much
as four smileys, obviously.

05:42.374 --> 05:44.835
Four smileys is symptomatic
of the complacency

05:44.835 --> 05:46.545
at the heart
of his out-of-touch campaign.

05:46.545 --> 05:49.465
Eggplant, eggplant, flag reeks
of the misogynistic bravado

05:49.465 --> 05:51.926
that has so repelled the median voter.

05:51.926 --> 05:53.844
Jesus. I feel sick.

05:54.179 --> 05:57.182
Why? It's fun.
My team's playing your team.

05:57.182 --> 06:00.142
It's only spicy 'cause if my team
wins, they're gonna shoot your team.

06:00.142 --> 06:01.478
Okay, but what are you hearing?

06:01.478 --> 06:03.479
Seriously, are these your vans,
the Nazi vans?

06:03.479 --> 06:06.691
The fun vans?
The fun buses, yeah.

06:06.691 --> 06:09.110
Yeah, in Florida, they picked people
up telling them they were taking them

06:09.110 --> 06:10.945
to vote and then a kid got left
by the highway.

06:10.945 --> 06:13.740
- It's fucking kidnapping, Rome.
- It's fucking kidnapping now?

06:13.740 --> 06:18.202
False flag. Nice try.
Kidnapping? It's kidnapping.

06:20.829 --> 06:22.624
- Hey.
- Lukas. Hey!

06:22.624 --> 06:25.709
So, it's looking like Jimenez,
which is good for democracy

06:25.709 --> 06:27.795
and great for us.

06:29.171 --> 06:32.675
So, either way, I think that
we consider releasing

06:32.675 --> 06:36.179
your, you know, your funky numbers
maybe tomorrow, day after tomorrow.

06:36.179 --> 06:37.847
Just get ahead of the numbers,

06:37.847 --> 06:40.307
and I can come up
with some language.

06:40.307 --> 06:42.851
I was talking last night

06:42.851 --> 06:46.230
to Oskar and Gregory Peggory
about that.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.483
I'm sorry, you spoke
to Greg about this?

06:49.483 --> 06:52.404
He was part of a conversation,
just as a normalist,

06:53.029 --> 06:55.739
and then I was wondering,

06:55.739 --> 07:01.161
maybe we keep my terrible secret
a secret, you know?

07:02.163 --> 07:06.500
Okay. Yeah, look,
let me have a think about that.

07:06.500 --> 07:10.087
I gotta take this.
I'll call you back.

07:11.214 --> 07:13.633
Nate, how's things
in Mission Control Denver?

07:13.633 --> 07:15.175
You in at ATN, Shiv?

07:15.175 --> 07:16.886
Upstairs. Leave it to them.
Dad's rules.

07:16.886 --> 07:20.264
Well, they need to be covering
the intimidation. Pretty dark, Shiv.

07:20.264 --> 07:24.601
Who watches the watchmen?
I fucking do.

07:25.394 --> 07:26.730
You getting good numbers?

07:26.730 --> 07:29.274
Good. I'm just watching the weather.
Storm clouds in Nevada.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.151
We got people in line.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.696
Disturbance in Wisconsin,
but, yeah, yeah.

07:35.530 --> 07:36.947
Scared, but good.

07:38.074 --> 07:39.742
Precinct data is...

07:40.535 --> 07:42.536
Pennsylvania, Arizona could be tough.

07:42.536 --> 07:44.080
Let's keep this channel open

07:44.080 --> 07:48.208
on all things Matsson and me
and the new ATN, yeah?

07:48.208 --> 07:49.794
All things good.

07:49.794 --> 07:52.005
All right, so Jimenez wins,

07:52.005 --> 07:55.008
and he just waves the fucking
deal through. And then we're what?

07:55.008 --> 07:59.596
I guess fucking last ditch?
The board? The shareholders?

08:01.014 --> 08:03.433
Okay, Jeryd wants face to face.

08:03.433 --> 08:04.517
Okay, me too?

08:04.934 --> 08:07.227
I doubt it. I'm asking.
Do you want to try Gil?

08:07.227 --> 08:09.606
- Or maybe direct Jimenez?
- Feels kind of sweaty.

08:09.606 --> 08:11.650
Maybe I'll wait a day.

08:11.650 --> 08:15.778
I guess today's the fucking day, right?

08:15.778 --> 08:18.197
Like, today's the day the rooster
puts his head in our hands,

08:18.197 --> 08:20.700
and today is the moment
of maximum leverage.

08:21.116 --> 08:24.871
No, it looks like just me.
It's a bit tight for both of us.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.706
Fuck him.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.333
All right, go, go, go. Sure.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.167
Let me know what you come up with.

08:35.714 --> 08:37.133
- Hey, Rava.
- Hey, listen.

08:37.884 --> 08:42.931
We are all okay,
but we're a bit freaked out.

08:42.931 --> 08:46.975
There is an SUV.
We think there's an SUV,

08:46.975 --> 08:51.898
and it's following.
So can we come to the office?

08:51.898 --> 08:54.608
Because you have
good security at the office.

08:54.608 --> 08:57.153
- What's the license plate?
- The license...

08:57.153 --> 09:00.949
Is it TR...
It's probably mine.

09:00.949 --> 09:03.285
I didn't want Sophie to freak,
so I just actioned it.

09:06.996 --> 09:09.541
Oh, my God,
you're having me followed?

09:09.541 --> 09:14.461
The covert surveillance to show
you care? The actual fuck, Ken?

09:14.461 --> 09:16.797
An extra layer of bubble wrap for her
and Ivey.

09:16.797 --> 09:18.382
Are you guys okay? You okay?

09:18.382 --> 09:20.592
- Is she okay?
- She's scared, Ken.

09:22.261 --> 09:26.766
I am scared. I don't...
There is shit burning.

09:26.766 --> 09:30.687
- There is intimidation.
- Relax, okay? Relax.

09:30.687 --> 09:34.273
Tell Sophie I love her,
and that is why I do everything I do.

09:34.816 --> 09:37.027
Hey, Soph?
Soph, I love you, sweetie, okay?

09:37.027 --> 09:38.402
Nothing's gonna happen.

09:38.402 --> 09:40.612
Exit polls say Jimenez, okay?

09:40.612 --> 09:43.741
I won't let the world push you,
okay, sweetie? Okay.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.212
Ken.

09:56.212 --> 09:58.339
Hey, man, just calling
to say good luck.

09:58.339 --> 10:00.174
- Great numbers.
- Thanks, man.

10:00.174 --> 10:03.678
And, listen, apologies
if things got a bit heated.

10:03.678 --> 10:05.012
A lot of shit going down.

10:05.012 --> 10:08.600
Victory vans and shitheads
kicking off in Milwaukee.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.018
- ATN wanna cover?
- Yeah.

10:10.018 --> 10:15.022
I'll talk, but gotta
let them do their thing, but yeah.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.485
Listen, you got Daniel there?

10:18.485 --> 10:20.652
You know, let me see.

10:26.618 --> 10:28.077
Yeah, come in.

10:30.663 --> 10:33.707
Sir, you here for Kendall Roy?

10:35.585 --> 10:37.586
- Hey, Kendall.
- Hey, Dan.

10:37.586 --> 10:40.339
Hey, man. Good luck.

10:40.339 --> 10:42.467
Just best of luck.

10:42.467 --> 10:45.095
Thanks, man. Great to speak.

10:45.095 --> 10:46.554
But when this is over,

10:47.180 --> 10:50.433
I think there needs to be a big
conversation about tech, is all I'd say.

10:50.433 --> 10:53.102
Great to speak.
I'm gonna put Nate back on.

10:53.102 --> 10:57.523
Sure, and may the best man who will
protect American jobs

10:57.523 --> 11:00.776
and reign in tech and is called
Daniel win, you know?

11:03.363 --> 11:05.614
Let's catch up.
Have a good one, man.

11:05.614 --> 11:07.199
Yeah, sure. Sure, man.

11:07.199 --> 11:10.412
You know, tonight,
my eye is just right here,

11:10.412 --> 11:13.248
making sure it's fair as fuck.
All right?

11:13.248 --> 11:15.750
Have a good night, man.
Stay hydrated.

11:33.852 --> 11:36.980
- Hey, come on in.
- Thank you.

11:40.984 --> 11:43.987
Busy, busy. Hello, hello.
Look at you, losing it.

11:43.987 --> 11:47.698
- Like a massive fucking loser.
- Yeah, well, I blame you.

11:47.698 --> 11:49.575
Couldn't deliver Connor, huh?

11:49.575 --> 11:52.953
ATN scared to run all the fraud.

11:52.953 --> 11:55.914
Well, I keep my hands out, you know?
Fuck you. What is this?

11:55.914 --> 11:58.042
'Cause, you know, I'm quite busy.

11:58.042 --> 11:59.628
- You're busy?
- Yes, I am busy.

11:59.628 --> 12:02.713
I don't run around town like
some fucking food-bike guy.

12:03.380 --> 12:06.051
Just wanted to say a couple things.

12:08.469 --> 12:09.720
Very directly...

12:12.097 --> 12:14.308
- We still think we can win.
- Sure.

12:14.308 --> 12:19.356
- But I am very focused on losing.
- All right.

12:19.356 --> 12:22.484
Winning is easy.
Winning would take care of itself.

12:22.484 --> 12:28.448
But if I lose, I need to work on what
assholes would call the narrative.

12:29.406 --> 12:33.452
Like insurgent campaign,
unfairly maligned as extremist

12:33.452 --> 12:36.205
by the Coastal Masturbation Factory.

12:36.205 --> 12:38.791
Exactly. If I lose, I want
it correctly characterized

12:38.791 --> 12:42.545
as a huge victory,
over-performed, right?

12:43.128 --> 12:47.675
I want to be the president.
I want you to be a partner in that,

12:47.675 --> 12:50.345
and if it isn't tonight,
it will be next time.

12:50.345 --> 12:52.430
Even if you're not going
to be the president,

12:52.430 --> 12:54.015
you're going to be our president.

12:54.015 --> 12:57.143
Exactly. You, me will go far.

12:57.143 --> 12:58.853
Over the road and into the bar.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.327
So listen, at some point tonight,
could we do a chat,

13:14.995 --> 13:18.665
in terms of the me of things
and, like, how to play it?

13:19.331 --> 13:23.211
Because Matsson, he treated me
quite abominably,

13:23.211 --> 13:26.172
but it felt like trusting,
and he was saying a lot of things.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.882
Okay, enough, enough, enough.
Where's my coffee?

13:29.968 --> 13:32.803
- Tom, I don't do coffee anymore.
- No, Greg.

13:33.679 --> 13:36.349
Greg, I have to be clear.
I have to.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.225
If I get drowsy,

13:38.225 --> 13:42.813
and I miscall Colorado,
instability, right?

13:44.024 --> 13:48.402
Then the US loses credibility, China
spots an opportunity, invades Taiwan,

13:48.402 --> 13:52.865
tactical nukes, fucking shit goes
kablooey, and we're back to amoeba.

13:52.865 --> 13:55.576
It's a long way back from pond life.

13:55.576 --> 13:58.538
'cause you failed to get me
a double shot, okay?

13:58.538 --> 14:02.499
Okay, well, do you want some
of what you asked for?

14:07.212 --> 14:10.508
No, I don't think so.
What do you think?

14:11.592 --> 14:14.054
Maybe, no, election night...

14:18.099 --> 14:22.061
- Your call, I mean...
- Yeah, hit me.

14:22.061 --> 14:25.482
But this is not a thing, okay?
It's not going in a book.

14:25.482 --> 14:29.778
- Let's just...
- Yeah, okay. Quick as a whistle.

14:36.952 --> 14:39.620
What do we have here?
What's on the board?

14:44.250 --> 14:48.379
Just rubbing the board, innocently,
simply cleaning the whiteboard here.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.760
- Here you go.
- No, no, not for me.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.680
I'm just starting to feel normal
from last night.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.765
You'll do it with Matsson,
but not with me?

14:58.765 --> 15:00.684
I don't want you looking all judgy
all night. Come on.

15:00.684 --> 15:03.561
No, I need a clear head, and
I don't want to get addicted.

15:03.561 --> 15:05.854
Shut up, Greg. Don't be Mom.
Come on.

15:05.854 --> 15:06.980
I don't want to. Please.

15:06.980 --> 15:10.360
Greg, it's medically good
for your brain. It is.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.153
What are you saying?
All Aztecs is stupid?

15:12.153 --> 15:14.364
Don't be a racist little
bitch about it. Come on.

15:14.364 --> 15:15.824
Yeah, okay.

15:16.782 --> 15:20.787
What? Are you pretending?
Are you pretending to do coke?

15:20.787 --> 15:22.872
- Some got up.
- Fucking do it.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.416
There. God!

15:30.130 --> 15:32.465
What the fuck is that?

15:32.465 --> 15:35.843
I guess they were ordering some
for folks.

15:35.843 --> 15:37.261
I said, "Why not get you one?".

15:37.261 --> 15:40.307
Bodega sushi?
Are you insane?

15:40.724 --> 15:42.642
That's not me. That's Samson.

15:42.642 --> 15:46.645
No, not Samson, Greg!
Not Samson! Not!

15:47.521 --> 15:49.316
I want you Gregging for me.

15:49.732 --> 15:51.567
You're busted back
down to Greg tonight.

15:51.567 --> 15:54.945
Yeah, tonight, my digestive
system is basically part

15:54.945 --> 15:56.155
of the Constitution, okay?

15:56.155 --> 15:59.283
Microwave milk and ginger shots,
American bottled water,

15:59.283 --> 16:01.661
spaghetti, and olive oil, okay?

16:01.661 --> 16:03.663
- Okay?
- Okay.

16:04.831 --> 16:07.167
- Hey, Con.
- Tom.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.128
Yeah, I got this crew here.

16:10.128 --> 16:15.716
And they're filming the stuff,
but none of it is making it on the show.

16:16.426 --> 16:19.470
Dude, is there any film
in these cameras?

16:19.470 --> 16:22.973
Yeah, I think we are planning
to feature, Con.

16:22.973 --> 16:25.644
Well, no, because I'm watching.

16:25.976 --> 16:28.062
Now, I expected to be frozen out

16:28.062 --> 16:30.397
by all those other mooks,
but you guys, come on.

16:30.397 --> 16:34.527
Give me some sugar, man.
Maybe everyone voted for me.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.488
- We don't know.
- Schrodinger's cat.

16:36.488 --> 16:38.530
Schrodinger's cat, Tom.

16:38.530 --> 16:43.744
Until we open the boxes, I'm just as
much president as the other two, yeah?

16:43.744 --> 16:46.872
Come on. If I do it,
that's the story of all time.

16:46.872 --> 16:49.751
Okay, I've got to go, but I'll see
what I can do.

16:49.751 --> 16:52.128
But I've got to go,
'cause the polls are closing.

16:54.506 --> 16:57.842
Okay, if it's gonna happen anywhere,
it's gonna happen in Kentucky.

16:58.217 --> 17:02.806
Anything can happen.

17:03.263 --> 17:04.807
So glad I didn't drop out.

17:04.807 --> 17:08.561
It just makes an election so much
more interesting when you're in it.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.397
You gotta be in it to win it.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.148
And it is 7 o'clock on the East Coast,

17:13.148 --> 17:15.986
which means polls have just
closed in half a dozen states.

17:15.986 --> 17:18.196
The most closely watched states
at this hour,

17:18.196 --> 17:21.032
Georgia, with its 16 electoral votes,

17:21.032 --> 17:24.660
and Virginia with its 13,
both key battleground states.

17:24.660 --> 17:28.163
As of this moment, it is too early
to project a winner in either.

17:28.163 --> 17:31.209
But our decision desk
can announce at this hour

17:31.209 --> 17:35.130
that Representative Jeryd Mencken
will defeat Governor Daniel Jimenez

17:35.130 --> 17:38.716
in the Commonwealth of Kentucky
as well as in the state of Indiana,

17:38.716 --> 17:41.051
where Mencken has enjoyed
a lead over Jimenez

17:41.051 --> 17:42.636
in the pre-election polling.

17:42.636 --> 17:45.807
Governor Jimenez will win
in the state of Vermont.

17:45.807 --> 17:48.017
No big surprises there
in the early part of the evening.

17:48.017 --> 17:51.062
We will need to look at more data
before we can make a projection.

17:55.984 --> 17:58.278
Hey, fuck Kentucky, Con!

17:59.404 --> 18:01.071
- No.
- Yes, fuck.

18:01.448 --> 18:06.328
No.
I shan't become that, no.

18:08.204 --> 18:10.664
Alas, Kentucky, Willa.

18:12.417 --> 18:14.376
Alas, vanity.

18:16.588 --> 18:18.756
Voters have made their voices heard.

18:18.756 --> 18:22.718
This could be the most important
election in our lifetime.

18:22.718 --> 18:24.346
So with polls about to close...

18:24.346 --> 18:27.307
No, I told you.
You can give it to me, Billy. Thank you.

18:29.224 --> 18:32.187
As we heat up, Tom, how much
do you want to give

18:32.187 --> 18:35.189
to a fair bit of intimidation,
his folks and ours?

18:35.649 --> 18:39.568
So, like fire in Wisconsin,
in Milwaukee, could be nasty.

18:39.568 --> 18:42.864
Could be electrical failure.
Might be Menckenists.

18:42.864 --> 18:46.743
Camera smash,
crew harassed in Portland. That's them.

18:47.743 --> 18:49.328
I trust you.

18:49.328 --> 18:53.999
All these counties here, again,
a little board malfunction here.

18:53.999 --> 18:57.712
What's he doing? What's this?
Hey, Pam?

18:57.712 --> 19:01.967
The touch screen. What's happening
with the touch screen?

19:02.341 --> 19:04.385
Tell him to stop touching
the touch screen.

19:04.385 --> 19:05.928
We have a replacement in place.

19:05.928 --> 19:07.389
- It's fine.
- It's not fine.

19:07.389 --> 19:10.182
You can see that it's not fine.
It's malfunctioning. Fuck!

19:12.060 --> 19:13.895
Touch screen's malfunctioning.

19:15.604 --> 19:17.439
Touch screen's malfunctioning.

19:17.439 --> 19:20.485
And we're gonna zoom in.
You can see right here...

19:20.485 --> 19:23.987
- The board seems to be acting up.
- What's going on?

19:23.987 --> 19:25.907
The touch screen is malfunctioning.

19:25.907 --> 19:27.659
What's going on?
What the fuck is going on?

19:27.659 --> 19:30.494
We're on it. Graphics generator
just shat the bed.

19:30.494 --> 19:33.164
- Where is my touch screen?
- You're losing it, Dave.

19:33.164 --> 19:35.708
Don't lose it, Dave.
Don't lose it tonight, Dave.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.420
It is now 9 PM on the East Coast.

19:38.420 --> 19:40.379
Can we get an ET
on that replacement?

19:40.379 --> 19:42.131
What the fuck's going on
with the touch screen? Tom?

19:42.131 --> 19:44.718
- I'm on it. I'm all over it.
- You're not on it. Fucking get on it.

19:44.718 --> 19:46.844
Figure it out.
Yeah, figure it out.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.513
- Now.
- It's happening.

19:49.513 --> 19:51.725
- Ken, it's happening.
- We're about to get a new batch.

19:51.725 --> 19:53.768
And if we drop numbers now,
I'm gonna come down there

19:53.768 --> 19:55.436
and put your fucking head
through that touch screen.

19:55.436 --> 19:57.312
- Fix it, fix it, fix it!
- No need to catastrophize.

19:57.312 --> 19:59.232
Where's the touchscreen?
Is it loading up?

19:59.232 --> 20:00.817
- It's loaded up.
- Well, get it on air.

20:00.817 --> 20:03.318
We're gonna be hemorrhaging.
We're gonna be a laughing stock.

20:03.318 --> 20:05.739
We're on it, Tom.
No one will notice, okay?

20:05.739 --> 20:08.867
We've done this before.
We have three, and they're all lined up.

20:08.867 --> 20:10.909
No one will notice?
I noticed. Am I no one?

20:10.909 --> 20:13.872
Do I look like no one? Do I?

20:14.288 --> 20:16.540
I mean, how the fuck
are we behind social media on this?

20:16.540 --> 20:18.043
We need to be leading this.

20:18.043 --> 20:21.337
Hey, Tom.
You got this fire in Wisconsin.

20:21.337 --> 20:22.464
You got this?

20:22.464 --> 20:25.174
Yes, I think we have that.
Yeah, electrical.

20:25.174 --> 20:27.427
Why aren't we covering, Tom?

20:27.427 --> 20:31.056
Well, because we always
have to choose what to focus on,

20:31.056 --> 20:33.849
and just because something
is on fire doesn't make it new.

20:33.849 --> 20:36.101
- Electrical failure?
- Not what we hear.

20:36.101 --> 20:38.479
No, it's not what Nate hears, Tom.

20:38.479 --> 20:41.315
- Well, bully for Nate.
- Hey, Tom.

20:41.315 --> 20:43.860
- Hey, Nate.
- We need to be all over this, Tom.

20:43.860 --> 20:49.032
Yeah, okay, I just think it's important
to keep our unique perspective,

20:49.032 --> 20:51.283
because we are getting
conflicting reporting.

20:51.283 --> 20:54.662
What about the actual photos
I can see of it happening?

20:54.662 --> 20:58.040
There are many, many things
happening in this nation right now.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.291
There are a million data points,

20:59.291 --> 21:02.461
and we have to select the ones
that are consequential.

21:02.461 --> 21:05.966
If these nutjobs are going
paramilitary, we could say that.

21:06.716 --> 21:09.135
But yes, we just need to respect
our viewership.

21:09.135 --> 21:12.179
By not telling them anything
they don't want to hear?

21:12.179 --> 21:15.684
You guys get this about the
Antifa firebombing in Milwaukee?

21:15.684 --> 21:19.062
No, we hear it's his people,
Mencken's.

21:19.771 --> 21:23.191
Okay, when it becomes a story,
then we'll run the story.

21:23.191 --> 21:25.527
Well, this is happening in, what,
a vote counting center?

21:25.527 --> 21:27.570
Yeah, it's a story,
Tom, it's a story.

21:27.570 --> 21:29.990
- Do not micromanage me, please.
- Tom !

21:29.990 --> 21:31.574
They're evacuating.

21:31.574 --> 21:34.369
We've got a local chopper up
and a reporter on the way.

21:34.369 --> 21:37.621
Guys, I've got to manage this.
I'll keep you looped, yeah?

21:37.621 --> 21:39.332
Talk to Greg, yeah?

21:40.166 --> 21:41.291
Yeah, hey, hey.

21:42.460 --> 21:44.169
We're not talking to Greg.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.465
Amateur hour down there.

21:47.465 --> 21:50.426
Okay, so if it happened
in Milwaukee,

21:50.426 --> 21:52.761
and if it's deliberate,
then it's Menckenists.

21:52.761 --> 21:54.723
False flag, could be.

21:54.723 --> 21:58.308
You can't just say false flag every time
you don't fucking agree with something.

21:59.394 --> 22:00.561
Okay, guys.

22:00.561 --> 22:02.396
We want a report about a fire
in Milwaukee,

22:02.396 --> 22:05.566
initially thought to have been caused
by an electrical failure,

22:05.566 --> 22:07.819
but now there are claims
and some counterclaims

22:07.819 --> 22:12.407
made by groups who are protesting
alleged voting irregularities.

22:12.407 --> 22:15.035
Hey, okay, well, do you know
if any of the ballots are intact?

22:15.035 --> 22:16.620
- It doesn't look likely.
- Where you at?

22:16.620 --> 22:18.163
Depends how many votes have gone.

22:18.163 --> 22:20.040
- But ballots have been lost?
- Yeah.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.917
We're chartering flights to Milwaukee.

22:22.917 --> 22:25.503
A ton of number crunching
by our analytics team.

22:25.503 --> 22:27.755
We're trying to check the
Milwaukee County voter rolls

22:27.755 --> 22:32.176
to see who's voted so far,
but can you help with the narrative?

22:32.176 --> 22:33.345
Yeah.

22:33.719 --> 22:36.514
Have you got all the bodies
that you need?

22:36.514 --> 22:39.391
Yeah, yeah.
We have a SWAT team on it.

22:39.391 --> 22:41.686
They're interfacing
with the Wisconsin team.

22:47.651 --> 22:50.444
Apparently he's just touching too hard
for it.

22:51.195 --> 22:52.906
He's touching with...

22:52.906 --> 22:57.327
No, Rome. Roman,
no brass on the battlefield, okay?

22:57.327 --> 22:59.745
That's one of Logan's
Geneva Conventions. Please, please.

22:59.745 --> 23:01.206
They evacuated the count center?

23:01.206 --> 23:04.166
I don't know. I'm down on my last
fucking touchscreen.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.542
What's going on?

23:05.542 --> 23:08.170
Nothing. Tom just thinks that
China's hacking his tech.

23:08.170 --> 23:10.714
I do not, but I do think he would
be more comfortable upstairs.

23:10.714 --> 23:13.510
Greg, will you please
help them upstairs?

23:13.510 --> 23:15.762
I think you would be more
comfortable upstairs.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.305
- Hello, Tom!
- Can I just wrangle you?

23:18.305 --> 23:21.518
- Wrangle?
- The ballots are still in there?

23:21.518 --> 23:23.268
- Okay, where are we?
- What's going on?

23:23.268 --> 23:27.232
Greg, can you please take
the VIPs to an upstairs setting?

23:27.232 --> 23:28.817
Can I grab the three of you...

23:28.817 --> 23:31.902
Tom! Reporter on the way.
Three, four out.

23:31.902 --> 23:36.116
- All right, all right.
- Tom? Can I have a word?

23:37.866 --> 23:40.995
- Won't take long, Tom.
- I really can't.

23:41.413 --> 23:47.209
I know. Can you please?
I just wanted to apologize

23:47.209 --> 23:50.171
for some of the things
that I said last night, okay?

23:50.587 --> 23:52.299
Okay.

23:52.715 --> 23:57.804
And to, you know,
give you an opportunity to...

23:59.972 --> 24:02.475
Well, I can't do it to that, so...

24:04.727 --> 24:07.354
How should I frame my face? Huh?

24:07.855 --> 24:10.817
You scared that I'm gonna
blab about you and Matsson?

24:10.817 --> 24:13.527
- Jesus fucking Christ, Tom.
- What?

24:14.154 --> 24:16.739
- My father just died, yeah?
- Yeah.

24:16.739 --> 24:18.741
My father just died.

24:19.451 --> 24:22.746
So maybe, you know, I can
get a little consideration on that

24:22.746 --> 24:25.874
and for, you know, a number of reasons
I've been feeling off-kilter,

24:25.874 --> 24:28.001
so I'm sorry, but...

24:28.001 --> 24:30.879
- Sure.
- What does that mean? Sure?

24:30.879 --> 24:34.591
- It means you hated him, Siobhan.
- I didn't hate him. I loved him.

24:34.591 --> 24:37.886
Well, it was complicated,
but sometimes you certainly hated him,

24:37.886 --> 24:41.306
and you also sort of killed him.

24:43.849 --> 24:46.602
- What the...
- Sort of.

24:46.602 --> 24:50.022
Yeah, sort of. That's the part
that I'm gonna remember.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.607
Thanks. No, thank you.

24:51.607 --> 24:54.819
Okay, you know what?
Actually, also, I'm pregnant.

24:54.819 --> 24:56.237
Yeah, by you.

24:56.779 --> 25:01.200
And there's never a good time
to say, but you need to know,

25:01.200 --> 25:04.204
so okay. Now you know.

25:05.038 --> 25:06.997
Right.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.505
Is that even true?

25:17.509 --> 25:18.967
What?

25:19.468 --> 25:20.761
Like, is that even true?

25:20.761 --> 25:24.641
Or is that, like, a new position
or a tactic? Or what?

25:31.814 --> 25:32.941
Okay.

25:46.538 --> 25:48.956
Wait, so we have an area.
Is it upstairs?

25:50.417 --> 25:55.796
Yeah. Uh-huh, yeah.
I think things are tough.

25:57.339 --> 26:02.345
- With my situation and Tom.
- You want us to have him killed?

26:02.929 --> 26:05.557
- I could do that.
- Yeah, maybe.

26:05.557 --> 26:10.478
I mean, I think
he's just a piece of filth,

26:10.478 --> 26:15.108
and there's stuff I would
like to tell you, but...

26:15.108 --> 26:19.863
Hey, I've been trying to get them to
move not in an aggressive way, but...

26:21.530 --> 26:23.657
Yeah, I mean, you just can't trust him.

26:24.616 --> 26:25.951
We got you.

26:25.951 --> 26:28.037
In terms of the fire,
it is still burning,

26:28.037 --> 26:31.374
and crews are struggling to contain,
let alone extinguish.

26:31.749 --> 26:33.792
Are there any reports
so far of injuries?

26:33.792 --> 26:37.839
None for now, fortunately. The building
was evacuated immediately

26:37.839 --> 26:39.883
and all workers
have been accounted for.

26:39.883 --> 26:42.469
Well, I'm gonna sneak
now that we're all in here.

26:43.803 --> 26:46.431
Who's responsible?
That's the story, right?

26:46.431 --> 26:48.016
Who burnt this place down?

26:48.016 --> 26:50.267
Yeah, to me, it always comes down
to a couple of favorites,

26:50.267 --> 26:51.727
the blacks or the Jews.

26:53.229 --> 26:56.358
- I'm kidding. It's a fucking joke.
- Will you please...

26:57.859 --> 27:00.694
Got it. Hey, Connor.

27:01.487 --> 27:03.030
Rome.

27:04.073 --> 27:05.992
Jeryd isn't picking up.

27:05.992 --> 27:09.745
Yeah.
It's a busy night for him.

27:09.745 --> 27:12.414
Because I wondered
if what we talked about

27:12.414 --> 27:15.209
might still be on offer,
ambassadorship wise.

27:15.209 --> 27:18.337
Well, that was kind
of a yesterday offer, Connor.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.839
You know if he doesn't make this,

27:19.839 --> 27:22.092
you're gonna be partially responsible.
I hope you're cool with that.

27:22.092 --> 27:24.511
Rome, I spent, like,
a hundred mil here.

27:24.511 --> 27:27.179
Couldn't I get a sniff
of even a little guy?

27:27.179 --> 27:29.890
Organize a little coup
down in old Peru?

27:29.890 --> 27:31.642
Put me in a Van to Tajikistan?

27:31.642 --> 27:33.977
Couldn't I just be our fun guy
in Uruguay?

27:33.977 --> 27:36.146
Your rhymes are compelling,
but what's in it for him, Con?

27:36.146 --> 27:40.025
Maybe just one of the finest political
operators of his generation

27:40.025 --> 27:41.152
sorting shit out.

27:41.152 --> 27:44.280
- I'll get back to you.
- Just this one.

27:45.115 --> 27:47.032
Every four years, in fact,

27:47.032 --> 27:49.618
it's probably going to come down
to a handful of states

27:49.618 --> 27:54.207
like Wisconsin, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona.

27:54.207 --> 27:58.002
Ignore the narratives early on
and just realize

27:58.002 --> 27:59.878
that we're going to be in
for a dogfight,

27:59.878 --> 28:02.214
for a late night in those last couple
of states.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.216
It is 11 PM on the East Coast.

28:04.216 --> 28:07.012
Polls have just closed
in four more key states.

28:07.012 --> 28:08.555
Okay, thanks.

28:08.555 --> 28:10.181
The ATN decision desk
can now project that...

28:10.181 --> 28:13.018
So under state law,
the vote can't be certified

28:13.018 --> 28:15.020
until the absentee ballots are counted.

28:15.020 --> 28:19.733
So no Wisconsin result is valid
until the absentee ballots are counted.

28:19.733 --> 28:23.111
- And how does Daniel feel?
- Confident, but terrified.

28:23.111 --> 28:25.654
I don't know, is there a name for that
feeling?

28:25.654 --> 28:27.406
Cuspy?

28:27.406 --> 28:30.160
Rome, so under Wisconsin law,
the vote can't be certified.

28:30.160 --> 28:33.079
Mencken says Wisconsin's done.
That's their position.

28:33.079 --> 28:36.832
But, well, no, there's, like, 100 000
absentee Milwaukee ballots missing.

28:37.292 --> 28:39.252
So we have to figure out a way
to go forward.

28:39.252 --> 28:41.837
Well, go forward to undermine
Mencken's lead?

28:41.837 --> 28:45.132
- Does he have a lead?
- Yep, yes.

28:45.132 --> 28:49.386
An artificial lead with 100 000
Milwaukee absentee ballots missing.

28:49.386 --> 28:51.388
Every vote must be counted.

28:52.390 --> 28:53.850
I think she's right.

28:53.850 --> 28:57.895
Well, yeah, okay, but we can count
the votes that we have.

28:57.895 --> 29:00.773
However, unfortunately,
some are lost, so...

29:00.773 --> 29:02.734
Unfortunately some are lost?

29:02.734 --> 29:04.943
Meaning what?
Fascist fuckheads burnt them.

29:04.943 --> 29:07.654
We literally do not know that.
It could very easily be your fucks.

29:07.654 --> 29:09.365
You're making hay
for political violence.

29:09.365 --> 29:11.660
Or your guys knew
they were going to lose,

29:11.660 --> 29:14.037
so they did something crazy to throw it
into question and get a revote.

29:14.037 --> 29:16.873
- You don't believe that.
- Yeah, maybe I do. I don't know.

29:16.873 --> 29:19.960
Jimenez is gonna take Pennsylvania
and Michigan and Arizona,

29:19.960 --> 29:22.003
so I don't know why you're getting
so fucking uppity about this shit.

29:22.003 --> 29:24.046
Why are you getting so uppity
about this shit if you're so confident?

29:24.046 --> 29:26.048
Because if Mencken wins,
it's the end of the world, okay?

29:26.048 --> 29:27.801
I'd like a little fucking cushion.

29:27.801 --> 29:30.761
Jimenez won't block the GoJo deal,
so fuck the guy, right?

29:31.303 --> 29:35.350
Who knows? Maybe he would.
We cannot let that be the thing...

29:36.266 --> 29:38.520
That's not the thing, right, Ken?

29:43.650 --> 29:45.609
I don't know.

29:46.735 --> 29:48.947
- Ken...
- I don't know.

29:49.363 --> 29:50.740
Don't get cynical.

29:51.825 --> 29:54.493
Not cynical, no, it's just...

29:55.619 --> 29:58.914
What's happening is happening.
I'm a realist.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.875
Yeah, says a man who'd cut
his son's throat

30:01.875 --> 30:03.295
and then eat him on the high pass.

30:03.295 --> 30:05.797
- We can all say nasty shit.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

30:05.797 --> 30:08.466
Hey, so, FVA is saying
they have enough vote reported

30:08.466 --> 30:12.011
to call Wisconsin, so Freedom Voice
America and VariNews are calling.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.138
Great, the maniacs.

30:13.471 --> 30:15.765
Well, can't get out-flanked,
we need to be fast,

30:15.765 --> 30:17.433
so I think we should call it, right?

30:17.433 --> 30:20.228
No, no, no!

30:20.228 --> 30:22.187
Tom, what is, an independent...

30:22.187 --> 30:24.815
Can you get us
Decision Desk Darwin ?

30:24.815 --> 30:26.275
Yep.

30:26.275 --> 30:29.486
I want to say a few words about
the emerging situation in Milwaukee,

30:29.987 --> 30:34.366
the situation the American people
are watching with increasing concern.

30:34.366 --> 30:36.328
We have a process...

30:36.328 --> 30:39.205
Respect the process,
count every vote.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.249
He's so fucking dull.

30:41.749 --> 30:45.669
Flop your dick out,
pop a nut, do something.

30:46.296 --> 30:49.798
That decision will have no legitimacy
if it does not account

30:49.798 --> 30:52.052
for all the ballots cast.

30:52.052 --> 30:53.385
Okay, Dar, thank you,

30:53.385 --> 30:55.430
and we have some thoughts
and some questions.

30:55.430 --> 30:56.681
Thank you, Darwin.

30:56.681 --> 30:59.433
Do you have a result
as it stands in Wisconsin?

31:00.393 --> 31:03.020
- We've tallied the vote totals so far.
- Yeah, I know, and?

31:03.020 --> 31:05.273
Margin for Mencken is significant.

31:05.273 --> 31:08.360
Couldn't be made up by outstanding,
existing, uncounted votes,

31:08.360 --> 31:09.527
only the ones destroyed.

31:09.527 --> 31:12.738
Okay, and we're not waiting
for burned votes, so we call it.

31:12.738 --> 31:15.074
- Right?
- I think they have to hold it again.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.701
A revote.

31:16.701 --> 31:20.372
I would say revote
is incredibly rare and complex,

31:20.372 --> 31:22.122
because while we theoretically know

31:22.122 --> 31:24.667
everyone who requested
an absentee ballot,

31:24.667 --> 31:27.504
we don't entirely know
how many turned them in,

31:27.504 --> 31:31.091
and there's nothing in Wisconsin law
that really covers what to do.

31:31.091 --> 31:33.718
Exactly. You can't do it. Boom.
Mencken, thank you.

31:33.718 --> 31:37.138
But of course, the team knows.

31:37.138 --> 31:40.433
We know how the missing votes would
have broken down.

31:40.433 --> 31:41.600
Well, they're gone.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.435
There's no way to know
what was on those ballots.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.604
Well, we do know,
because past elections,

31:45.604 --> 31:47.940
Milwaukee overwhelmingly votes Democrat.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.402
- But you don't actually know.
- Sure.

31:50.402 --> 31:53.989
- I just basically do know.
- We do know.

31:53.989 --> 31:57.616
Because you're so plugged in, you
know how all the little peasants vote?

31:57.616 --> 31:59.494
This is the grown-ups' table,
be serious.

31:59.494 --> 32:01.203
This is serious.
Ballots get lost every election.

32:01.203 --> 32:03.539
- You can't get burnt ballots back.
- Bullshit. Just bullshit.

32:03.539 --> 32:07.418
It's full of fucking bullshit.
What?

32:07.418 --> 32:10.213
- You sound a little unhinged.
- You fucking watch it, Tom.

32:11.256 --> 32:14.800
There's no way to say in here
how people would have voted.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.304
You want to just run your model
and not bother with all the people?

32:17.304 --> 32:19.763
We're saying, historically,
people overwhelmingly...

32:19.763 --> 32:22.099
Historically, people used to burn
witches. We should do that?

32:22.099 --> 32:23.892
Burn witches?
Rome, look!

32:23.892 --> 32:28.063
We just know that the fire would have
destroyed a lot of Jimenez's ballots.

32:28.063 --> 32:30.649
So the fire favors GOP,
claims mad witch.

32:30.649 --> 32:33.277
- We just know.
- We're not gonna rerun the election.

32:33.277 --> 32:35.571
And if the right gets
wrongly blamed for this,

32:35.571 --> 32:38.658
what would that do? If the left does,
could get nasty.

32:38.658 --> 32:41.827
- Where are you going?
- I am going to the bathroom to shit.

32:41.827 --> 32:43.622
Would you like me to livestream it?

32:45.165 --> 32:47.000
Ken, you want to weigh in?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.836
Mark Raven had had some thoughts
about what we've been seeing.

32:49.836 --> 32:53.380
- I just think it's hard.
- But we know. We just do.

32:53.380 --> 32:57.344
That if the lost votes were counted,
Jimenez would take the state.

32:57.344 --> 33:00.555
Mark is commenting directly.
ATN voice.

33:02.681 --> 33:05.851
Isn't this funny?
With polls which undercount support

33:05.851 --> 33:07.978
for traditional values.

33:08.605 --> 33:11.273
So, yeah, maybe some of the crazies
heard they were underperforming

33:11.273 --> 33:14.110
and decided to stop the counting
and destroy the evidence.

33:14.110 --> 33:17.197
And so, yeah, you just stay quiet.

33:17.197 --> 33:18.490
Roman sent talking points.

33:18.490 --> 33:21.033
We'll guess what we think was
on those ballots.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.534
- We'll decide, yeah?
- Is he down there?

33:22.534 --> 33:23.745
They know best, right?

33:23.745 --> 33:26.413
And you'll eat what's for dinner
because they don't really care

33:26.413 --> 33:29.083
for folks who answer back
or ask too many questions. Shut up!

33:29.083 --> 33:31.377
Innumerate residuum.

33:31.377 --> 33:33.088
We'll figure it out and issue you

33:33.088 --> 33:36.924
with your new government to march into
your homes and take whatever we want

33:36.924 --> 33:39.052
in the way of your
mechanisms of self-defense

33:39.052 --> 33:40.971
and tell your son
she's actually your daughter

33:40.971 --> 33:42.681
or the other way around.

33:42.681 --> 33:45.141
Hey, Shiv, do you mind
actually not going on the floor?

33:45.141 --> 33:48.143
- It's all just peachy.
- Shiv!

33:49.521 --> 33:51.856
And the new president is opening
up his borders to his friends.

33:51.856 --> 33:54.526
Bullshit, Roman, fuck you.

33:54.943 --> 33:56.902
It's obvious, painful,
we need to be smarter than this,

33:56.902 --> 34:00.156
better than this, we need
a fucking opposing viewpoint.

34:02.449 --> 34:03.910
Do we call security?

34:05.786 --> 34:07.871
Sorry, you can't come down here.

34:07.871 --> 34:10.457
- It's not me.
- Hey, Lukas.

34:10.834 --> 34:12.210
What the fuck is going on?

34:12.210 --> 34:13.919
Yeah, great fucking question.

34:13.919 --> 34:17.674
- Powerful commentary, huh?
- I don't feel good necessarily.

34:18.133 --> 34:19.467
Shucks.

34:20.844 --> 34:23.053
Is it okay?
Do I need to hustle?

34:23.053 --> 34:27.100
Do I need to get ready to be cozy
with this fucking Mr. Scary?

34:27.100 --> 34:28.935
No, no, I can handle it.

34:28.935 --> 34:32.272
Greg tells me it's getting
kind of hairy in there.

34:32.272 --> 34:34.816
Don't let him break my toy, Shiv, okay?

34:34.816 --> 34:36.901
Okay. I'll be in touch.

34:36.901 --> 34:39.362
Sorry, we just need you
off the floor if that's okay.

34:39.362 --> 34:40.696
Yeah, got a minute?

34:42.490 --> 34:44.492
And now, apparently
the Democrats are accusing

34:44.492 --> 34:46.620
this fire of being biased.

34:46.620 --> 34:50.122
That's right, yeah, that sounds pretty
much something out of their camp.

34:50.122 --> 34:52.791
It only burned Democratic votes, yeah?

34:52.791 --> 34:55.919
You know, it's one
of those picky fires.

34:59.174 --> 35:00.884
- Come on in.
- Yeah.

35:02.634 --> 35:05.804
Yeah, just wanted
to check in, you know?

35:05.804 --> 35:08.975
- It's been busy, so...
- Right, yeah, on election day.

35:10.184 --> 35:11.311
Yeah.

35:11.769 --> 35:15.523
So how was your night last night
with Lukas?

35:17.692 --> 35:22.280
Shiv, I went for a drink with him.
That's not my fault.

35:26.158 --> 35:29.120
Do you find me attractive, Gregory?

35:32.499 --> 35:36.502
I don't think of things such as that.

35:37.379 --> 35:39.713
I thought you were
a "disgusting brother".

35:39.713 --> 35:41.840
Was that too disgusting for you?

35:42.800 --> 35:45.010
This is not appropriate.

35:48.223 --> 35:50.892
Yeah, I'm sorry...

35:50.892 --> 35:53.019
'Cause I'm just letting you know

35:53.520 --> 35:57.356
that if you try to fuck me,
I'll kill you.

36:00.860 --> 36:02.278
Got it.

36:02.862 --> 36:04.948
Got it, sorry, yeah.

36:06.157 --> 36:10.620
I guess my only question would be

36:11.162 --> 36:15.582
if anything did come to pass in terms
of you and he,

36:17.376 --> 36:19.461
you know, silence is golden.

36:22.340 --> 36:23.924
Like how golden?

36:25.509 --> 36:29.763
- Is there an offer?
- Yeah.

36:30.682 --> 36:33.101
How about I offer for you to keep
all your internal organs

36:33.101 --> 36:35.812
rather than I pull them out
your asshole?

36:38.815 --> 36:42.776
Go on, you're lumber.
Keep your snout out.

36:46.281 --> 36:50.827
Simultaneously destroying diversity
of opinion wherever possible.

36:52.370 --> 36:56.207
Hey, guess what?
Mencken will block the deal.

36:57.416 --> 36:58.752
Sraight up, he'll kill it.

36:58.752 --> 37:00.920
If he wins, he'll refer it to FTC, whatever,

37:00.920 --> 37:03.672
new law, foreign ownership tightening.

37:03.672 --> 37:07.135
He'll screw it up in exchange
for our support tonight.

37:07.135 --> 37:10.471
In so many words?

37:10.471 --> 37:12.514
Those words.
Shall I get Tom?

37:12.849 --> 37:16.185
Shall I get the human abacus,
shall I? Let's do it.

37:17.186 --> 37:18.354
This is good news.

37:24.319 --> 37:27.989
Hey, hey.
So, thanks for whatever.

37:27.989 --> 37:31.660
We have the votes,
so can't rerun fairly

37:31.660 --> 37:35.163
and can't let lefty terrorism
affect this, so let's call it.

37:35.163 --> 37:38.582
On what precedent?
By what authority?

37:39.124 --> 37:42.003
By the power of me,
the CEO of Waystar,

37:42.003 --> 37:44.714
telling you what to put on the telebox
mouth people.

37:45.255 --> 37:47.759
I don't think we can do that, guys.

37:47.759 --> 37:49.344
I think we can do it, Dar.

37:49.344 --> 37:52.931
If we call it, and the others
went his way...

37:52.931 --> 37:55.224
Right, well, look, there
are still outstanding states.

37:55.224 --> 37:57.476
There's Michigan,
Ohio, Georgia, Arizona.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.312
It's really not that big a deal.
It's one state.

37:59.312 --> 38:02.774
I'm worried it's not a decision
that I could necessarily...

38:02.774 --> 38:05.402
Yeah, thank you, and everyone
respects you, Darwin,

38:05.402 --> 38:07.194
but this isn't actually
a numbers thing.

38:07.194 --> 38:09.363
I mean, the Wisconsin
Elections Commission,

38:09.363 --> 38:12.242
the Milwaukee Election Commission
will go to court,

38:12.242 --> 38:16.704
and the camps will litigate it,
and it'll be a jurisdiction fight

38:16.704 --> 38:19.124
that I think Mencken might shake,
but, you know, we can't...

38:19.124 --> 38:22.876
Yeah, that's great,
but I'm just gonna say we're good,

38:22.876 --> 38:24.296
and that's on me.

38:24.296 --> 38:27.215
The votes that exist have been tallied,
and that gives Mencken the state.

38:27.215 --> 38:30.259
But you don't make the call.
I make the call.

38:30.259 --> 38:31.636
We're gonna make the call together.

38:31.636 --> 38:34.180
You can't make the call
till I make the call.

38:34.180 --> 38:36.390
Okay, so, and I'm not
gonna make you do anything.

38:36.390 --> 38:39.811
This is the situation in Wisconsin.
How would you feel

38:39.811 --> 38:42.480
if we were to not call it,
call it, but...

38:42.480 --> 38:45.191
Like, pending.
We could call it pending.

38:45.191 --> 38:46.651
You could even explain it.

38:46.651 --> 38:49.486
We can get a camera on you
to explain it to people.

38:55.577 --> 38:57.120
I could explain.

38:58.121 --> 39:01.791
And could there be a graphic
that makes it clear the call

39:01.791 --> 39:06.211
isn't a "call" call?

39:06.211 --> 39:08.006
Pending call.

39:14.804 --> 39:18.016
- All right, so...
- Yeah? Satisfied?

39:18.016 --> 39:19.893
- We can.
- Great.

39:22.520 --> 39:25.397
- What's up?
- You okay?

39:26.482 --> 39:28.985
There's something in my eyes.

39:30.487 --> 39:32.030
Greg. Hey, wasabi.

39:32.530 --> 39:35.949
Is it wasabi?
Is wasabi in my eyes?

39:35.949 --> 39:39.329
- I've got wasabi in my eyes?
- Wait, wait, wait.

39:41.205 --> 39:43.165
No, it's gone more in!

39:43.165 --> 39:45.167
- What's going on?
- It's on my fingers.

39:45.167 --> 39:47.671
What'd you do to him?

39:47.671 --> 39:50.215
Greg!
Get some water or something, Greg!

39:51.675 --> 39:53.802
Fuck me slowly, this smarts.

39:53.802 --> 39:56.388
Greg, put water in.
Put water in.

39:57.388 --> 40:00.849
That's lemon!
It's lemon, Greg!

40:00.849 --> 40:03.895
- That's clear. It's La Croix.
- Greg, what are you doing?

40:03.895 --> 40:08.608
- It's lemony!
- Jesus H. Christ.

40:08.608 --> 40:10.943
No, it's natural, like medical.

40:10.943 --> 40:12.444
Give it to me.

40:12.444 --> 40:15.114
It's not that lemony.
It's just a hint of lemon.

40:15.114 --> 40:17.284
Darwin, you good to call it?

40:17.284 --> 40:19.159
He can't fucking call it, Rome.

40:19.159 --> 40:22.913
We're calling it, Shiv.
He just called it, okay?

40:22.913 --> 40:28.712
Greg, do not put any more lemon
water or wasabi in his eyes, okay?

40:33.508 --> 40:35.468
Hey, Con, you shouldn't really
be in here.

40:35.468 --> 40:37.554
And a very good evening to you too.

40:37.554 --> 40:40.014
- Hey, Presidente.
- Rome. Sweetheart, one second.

40:40.014 --> 40:41.808
Would you wait over here
for me a second?

40:41.808 --> 40:44.309
Fellas, would you wait over here
for me a second?

40:44.309 --> 40:48.856
Rome. How about I concede
in his direction?

40:50.066 --> 40:52.484
I scratch his balls,
he scratches mine.

40:52.819 --> 40:56.489
That's interesting. Perhaps-ish.
Let me check on that.

40:56.489 --> 40:58.824
- Perhaps-ish?
- Perhaps-ish, yeah. Come on.

40:59.618 --> 41:03.622
Pam, we're calling Wisconsin
for Mencken. Get the graphics up.

41:03.622 --> 41:06.750
Dave, let me know we're five out
from calling Wisconsin.

41:06.750 --> 41:09.251
All right, we are calling Wisconsin
for Mencken, five minutes.

41:09.251 --> 41:10.962
Is that graphic ready?

41:10.962 --> 41:12.796
There is a big old call
to make right now,

41:12.796 --> 41:16.843
and that is ATN is projecting that
Jeryd Mencken has won

41:16.843 --> 41:18.135
the state of Wisconsin.

41:18.135 --> 41:21.931
We've been reporting on that fire
in the Milwaukee Vote Count Center.

41:21.931 --> 41:26.393
Nonetheless, our decision desk
is confident in making this call.

41:26.393 --> 41:29.521
Jeryd Mencken has won the state
of Wisconsin,

41:29.521 --> 41:33.108
and there goes the blue wall.
That's 10 electoral votes.

41:33.108 --> 41:36.029
That brings Mencken up to 246...

41:36.029 --> 41:38.782
Okay, man. Okay,
there's something there.

41:39.448 --> 41:40.867
Sordid backseat fuck job.

41:42.202 --> 41:43.495
Tell me more.

41:43.495 --> 41:45.204
He wants to keep up the momentum.

41:45.204 --> 41:50.126
He is now 24 electoral votes away
from winning the presidency.

41:50.126 --> 41:53.380
- Do you really want it?
- Slovenia, Willa.

41:57.591 --> 42:01.179
I am torn, and he's very right-wing.

42:03.682 --> 42:07.978
But Vienna for lunch,
Venice for dinner.

42:08.602 --> 42:10.563
And Dubrovnik for breakfast.

42:11.564 --> 42:14.983
My fellow Americans, it's becoming
clear tonight

42:14.983 --> 42:16.902
that as far as we can tell,

42:16.902 --> 42:20.991
Mr. Jeryd Mencken will likely be the
next president of the United States.

42:20.991 --> 42:23.784
And I, for one, wish him well.

42:23.784 --> 42:25.620
Conner was running for president?

42:25.620 --> 42:28.164
Although I set out a clear
and compelling path,

42:28.164 --> 42:32.209
America, under divine wisdom,
has chosen to take another.

42:32.794 --> 42:34.628
Well, good luck.

42:35.129 --> 42:39.175
And I'd like to say to my first running
mate, who I will not dignify

42:39.175 --> 42:43.263
with a name check, but had
that woman not dropped out,

42:43.263 --> 42:46.558
and then had I not had to replace
her with another figure

42:46.558 --> 42:49.351
who turned out not to be able
to bear the weight of public scrutiny,

42:49.351 --> 42:55.024
had I not been betrayed by those
two jackrabbits, who knows?

42:56.066 --> 42:59.487
Politics of envy, ugly game.

43:00.488 --> 43:03.617
I happen to be a billionaire. Sorry.

43:04.701 --> 43:06.994
But honestly, America, you flunked it.

43:06.994 --> 43:11.206
I guess you're gonna have to find some
other poor mook's paps to suckle on.

43:11.875 --> 43:15.712
The corrupt bipartisan system zombie
marches on.

43:15.712 --> 43:18.840
And so I call out to my friends
tonight, to my people,

43:18.840 --> 43:22.510
I say, Conheads, I salute you.
And America, be afraid.

43:23.553 --> 43:26.889
Be warned,
for the Conheads are coming.

43:27.431 --> 43:29.309
Thank you. God bless America.

43:30.017 --> 43:33.813
ATN decision desk is now projecting
Daniel Jimenez has won

43:33.813 --> 43:36.524
the state of Michigan
over Jeryd Mencken.

43:36.524 --> 43:38.568
That's 15 electoral votes.

43:38.568 --> 43:40.986
Our tally now goes,
are you ready for this,

43:40.986 --> 43:46.451
262 for Mencken
and 262 for Daniel Jimenez.

43:46.451 --> 43:47.660
A dead heat.

43:47.660 --> 43:50.954
Polls will be closing soon in Alaska,
the only state yet to be called

43:50.954 --> 43:54.668
other than Arizona,
and its 11 electoral votes.

43:56.543 --> 43:58.505
Guys, just a heads up.

43:58.505 --> 44:01.298
We hear, we are getting it
from the campaigns,

44:01.298 --> 44:06.346
the data nerds are hearing that...
Dar, you say.

44:06.346 --> 44:09.682
So Arizona is gonna go red.

44:09.682 --> 44:11.977
All right, well then
that would be it, right?

44:11.977 --> 44:16.480
I mean, we're kind of boxed in
because of Wisconsin.

44:16.480 --> 44:19.150
I mean, I don't feel comfortable
calling it.

44:19.150 --> 44:20.944
PGN is gonna be calling it,
right, Tom?

44:20.944 --> 44:23.070
They're going to call Arizona.

44:23.070 --> 44:27.575
Because if we call it...
We called Wisconsin pending.

44:27.575 --> 44:31.830
We already called Wisconsin, okay?
We can't uncall Wisconsin, can we?

44:31.830 --> 44:33.748
That would make us all look
pretty unprofessional.

44:33.748 --> 44:39.378
So, Arizona,
we're calling the election?

44:39.378 --> 44:40.714
- Yeah.
- No, no.

44:40.714 --> 44:42.047
- No?
- No.

44:42.047 --> 44:44.801
- It's math, dude.
- Will you guys give us a minute?

44:44.801 --> 44:45.969
Sure, okay.

44:45.969 --> 44:49.138
One minute,
be back in one minute, please. What?

44:49.931 --> 44:51.182
- That's it.
- I don't know.

44:51.182 --> 44:55.978
Like, maybe, maybe we revisit Wisconsin.

44:56.562 --> 45:00.691
That was kind of... Right?

45:00.691 --> 45:03.777
I get it. No, you're gonna like
big brother it right now.

45:03.777 --> 45:05.946
- That's what you're gonna do?
- No, like what?

45:05.946 --> 45:08.742
Like when, you know, if you want
roast chicken and I wanted steak,

45:08.742 --> 45:10.159
we always had chicken.

45:10.159 --> 45:13.704
Because you'd freak out,
you'd tantrum, so they thought...

45:13.704 --> 45:16.874
I would fucking tantrum
because I never had fucking steak.

45:16.874 --> 45:21.128
Well, I think they got scared
if you tantrum,

45:21.128 --> 45:24.466
then you'd think you'd won,
so they couldn't let you have steak.

45:24.466 --> 45:27.384
Because we had so much chicken,
I have to like the fascist?

45:27.384 --> 45:29.054
Yeah.

45:29.638 --> 45:33.098
If we don't call it early and he wins
anyway, which is perfectly possible,

45:33.098 --> 45:35.310
but without us anyway,
think about that.

45:35.310 --> 45:37.437
With FVA and VariNews
backing him,

45:37.437 --> 45:39.688
we're left the most dickless eunuchs
in cuck town.

45:39.688 --> 45:42.316
If we call this,
if we push it...

45:43.400 --> 45:44.485
Maybe it happens.

45:44.485 --> 45:47.112
Yeah, we give it to Mencken,
Mencken blocks the deal.

45:47.112 --> 45:48.990
He's not fucking wishy-washy,
he's a guy.

45:48.990 --> 45:51.409
I don't know, dude, I mean...

45:54.621 --> 45:56.748
My kids, the whole thing...

45:56.748 --> 45:58.416
America!

45:58.416 --> 46:04.338
Well, I mean, it is kind of a nice idea,
all the different people together.

46:05.006 --> 46:07.050
What?
All right, what would Dad do?

46:08.050 --> 46:10.804
- I don't know, I don't actually know.
- Yes, you fucking do, man.

46:10.804 --> 46:13.263
The guy in the pocket,
the guy that's gonna answer our calls,

46:13.263 --> 46:15.307
the fucking guy printing US dollars.

46:15.307 --> 46:16.601
This is all upside.

46:16.601 --> 46:18.770
Apart from the matter of him smashing
the country to pieces.

46:18.770 --> 46:21.063
Oh, God, don't be
such a fucking prissy.

46:21.063 --> 46:23.482
Okay, maybe we could deal
with a dose of that, right?

46:23.482 --> 46:26.151
Like a nice little dose
of the frighteners, wind shit back 20?

46:26.151 --> 46:28.862
One of those fucking guys
pushed my daughter.

46:28.862 --> 46:30.115
She's okay?

46:30.115 --> 46:35.287
If we do this,
people are gonna say shit.

46:35.287 --> 46:37.621
Yeah, we'll be in the West Wing.
Nothing matters, Ken.

46:37.621 --> 46:38.747
Nothing fucking matters.

46:38.747 --> 46:42.960
Dad's dead and the country's just a big
pussy waiting to get fucked.

46:44.296 --> 46:47.673
Fucking action, okay?
We can pay for any damages.

46:47.673 --> 46:50.427
Let's just jam our fucking heads
in the bosom of history

46:50.427 --> 46:52.512
and just... Right?

46:52.512 --> 46:56.015
Or we sit on our hands like a couple
of damsels in distress

46:56.015 --> 46:58.475
and let our chance slip away.

46:59.436 --> 47:02.646
PGN has a major projection
to announce

47:02.646 --> 47:05.525
and that is that Jeryd Mencken
will win Arizona.

47:05.525 --> 47:09.195
So he is the winner of 11 electoral
votes in Arizona.

47:09.195 --> 47:12.031
Jeryd Mencken wins
the state of Arizona.

47:12.031 --> 47:13.574
Can we talk for a minute?

47:13.992 --> 47:16.285
Yeah, we're fucked, Ken.

47:17.078 --> 47:19.247
We're fucked because
we called, it's fucked.

47:19.247 --> 47:20.624
I don't know what we should do.

47:20.624 --> 47:26.338
I feel like my head is just like...
I can't get the scale of it,

47:26.338 --> 47:27.671
what this is.

47:27.671 --> 47:29.173
We can recant, yeah?

47:29.173 --> 47:33.637
His team is being very direct.
They will block Matsson's deal.

47:35.012 --> 47:36.306
Well, he says he will.

47:36.306 --> 47:39.224
We call it for him. That gives him
legitimacy to declare.

47:39.224 --> 47:41.352
I mean, we're in bed with him,
I think, yeah.

47:42.728 --> 47:46.274
I mean, it'll get ground out
in the courts, whatever we say.

47:46.274 --> 47:47.983
Sure, right, but...

47:47.983 --> 47:52.654
Shall we be totally honest in here?

47:54.616 --> 47:58.662
I have sometimes felt like
I could do it,

47:58.662 --> 48:01.331
like I should do it, me.

48:02.374 --> 48:03.875
Just me.

48:04.584 --> 48:09.756
But I don't want that to be an end
to the family thing.

48:09.756 --> 48:15.887
I would like to be able to talk openly
about that feeling, maybe.

48:17.137 --> 48:19.724
Sure, yeah, no,
I appreciate that.

48:19.724 --> 48:23.353
Mencken is kind of Roman's guy,
so that's complicated.

48:23.353 --> 48:25.230
Yeah, right.

48:25.230 --> 48:29.358
And honestly, I feel threatened,
maybe, by their relationship,

48:30.151 --> 48:33.904
and a piece of me wants
to not support that,

48:33.904 --> 48:37.157
and that's maybe in there,
pulling away from Mencken.

48:40.370 --> 48:44.415
- But also, you're a good guy.
- Well, I don't know.

48:45.290 --> 48:47.543
- Sure, you are.
- Thank you.

48:47.543 --> 48:50.629
No, essentially,
you're a good guy.

48:56.177 --> 49:01.266
But we all want to stop Matsson,
right? That's the thing?

49:03.810 --> 49:07.022
- Yeah.
- Go on.

49:07.771 --> 49:14.279
Well, I think whatever advantage
to us as corporate players

49:14.279 --> 49:21.285
in the short term, you know,
Mencken's the nightmare.

49:22.287 --> 49:25.832
Yeah?
Plausible in a decadent era.

49:25.832 --> 49:28.584
He says the bad shit,
he believes the bad shit.

49:28.584 --> 49:31.378
We wouldn't actually
be making him president.

49:31.378 --> 49:34.840
Sure, we might not be able to crown
him, but we can stop him.

49:35.424 --> 49:38.552
He gets momentum tonight,
it makes it possible.

49:38.552 --> 49:40.889
He needs our call.

49:50.481 --> 49:53.026
I don't think I'm a very good father.

49:54.402 --> 49:55.861
You are.

49:55.861 --> 50:00.032
You're okay.
You've tried.

50:01.242 --> 50:02.744
That's all we can do.

50:03.286 --> 50:06.373
- Maybe the poison drips through.
- No.

50:06.373 --> 50:08.583
No. You know what?

50:08.583 --> 50:10.834
I don't think even Dad
would back him tonight.

50:10.834 --> 50:12.878
He basically picked him.

50:12.878 --> 50:15.340
Sure, but we throw the papers
and the whole thing in for him,

50:15.340 --> 50:18.885
and then in a month, a week from
now, the courts go the other way?

50:18.885 --> 50:20.886
We're essentially done
as a news organization.

50:20.886 --> 50:24.724
It's just hard to think we'd give
it all away to Matsson.

50:27.601 --> 50:30.939
Could we try?
Could you try once,

50:31.898 --> 50:36.111
direct to Nate, to get something
from them to block the deal?

50:37.945 --> 50:39.530
Yeah.

50:40.907 --> 50:43.701
- Yeah?
- Sure.

50:45.161 --> 50:47.913
- One of these?
- Yeah.

50:49.581 --> 50:50.792
You're a good guy.

51:10.811 --> 51:17.192
Hey, Nate! Just calling...

51:20.320 --> 51:23.782
I'm just wondering if Jimenez can...

51:23.782 --> 51:25.451
Try to call again.

51:27.578 --> 51:33.043
So, Shiv is seeing
what we can get from de Dems.

51:33.043 --> 51:35.003
Get the fuck out of here. Why?

51:35.003 --> 51:37.338
We really need to know
what we're doing, guys.

51:37.338 --> 51:40.884
- If we want to stick with Wisconsin...
- One moment, Tom.

51:42.469 --> 51:45.555
So, you talk to him?

51:45.555 --> 51:48.600
Yeah. I think
there's something there.

51:48.600 --> 51:51.935
- No, there's not.
- Like...

51:51.935 --> 51:55.272
Like they might be...
They are willing to think.

51:55.272 --> 51:59.110
They might be, or maybe
they are willing to think?

51:59.110 --> 52:02.905
- That sounds like horseshit.
- No, Rome, they're just not so direct.

52:02.905 --> 52:05.951
Yeah, I think we can probably
get them to stop it.

52:05.951 --> 52:09.328
Probably... Sorry, no.
Game over. Bullshit.

52:09.328 --> 52:12.289
No, we have to call it.
Mencken is rock solid.

52:12.289 --> 52:16.502
Roman, even Dad, in this situation
would respect the process.

52:16.502 --> 52:18.629
Dad did whatever
the fuck he wanted.

52:18.629 --> 52:21.256
One fact, he took out a government.
He did it.

52:21.256 --> 52:23.551
"Fuck Lyle". Send.
And that was it.

52:23.551 --> 52:25.886
That's all it took.
Fucking Canada here.

52:25.886 --> 52:27.639
- He didn't give a shit.
- He liked stability, Rome.

52:27.639 --> 52:29.849
He pushed, but
he didn't want shit to unravel.

52:29.849 --> 52:33.185
- He ended wars.
- He ended wars that he started.

52:33.185 --> 52:37.523
- He did whatever the fuck he wanted.
- What did Nate actually say?

52:37.523 --> 52:41.026
He said they would talk, and that
they could see the arguments,

52:41.026 --> 52:43.905
and I think it's encouraging.

52:44.489 --> 52:47.741
- You felt like it was encouraging?
- It was encouraging.

52:47.741 --> 52:50.578
It was a feeling.
I got something real.

52:50.578 --> 52:53.455
This is fucking pointless.
What a waste of time.

52:53.455 --> 52:55.624
I'm gonna call.

52:55.624 --> 52:58.335
I'm gonna be very direct.
We just need a little bit more.

52:58.335 --> 53:00.714
- Don't call him.
- Why?

53:01.338 --> 53:04.008
They're busy.

53:10.848 --> 53:13.685
Can't have uncertainty.
Can't. Fucking market.

53:14.185 --> 53:16.979
The chaos of trying
to rerun an entire election

53:16.979 --> 53:19.023
could just send the country
into meltdown.

53:19.023 --> 53:20.649
Okay, bad faith argument.

53:20.649 --> 53:23.777
You can't have uncertainty.
China is coming.

53:23.777 --> 53:25.362
- China is coming?
- China's coming.

53:25.362 --> 53:27.157
China's already been. Next.

53:29.074 --> 53:32.745
It's not like the fucking
final final anyway, okay?

53:32.745 --> 53:36.415
There's the court shit, and it all
kind of just fuzzes along, you know?

53:36.749 --> 53:39.877
It's a waste of fucking time.
That we don't have, by the way.

53:42.504 --> 53:45.591
- Greg, can I ask you a question?
- What's up?

53:46.216 --> 53:48.844
Do you know if there's something
going on...

53:50.471 --> 53:53.599
What else Nate and Gil
and fucking Jimenez offer you?

53:54.516 --> 53:57.395
Unlimited social spending
spending with this one weird trick?

54:07.654 --> 54:09.366
How was that call?

54:10.324 --> 54:12.994
What'd you get?
Whole bunch of not much?

54:14.079 --> 54:16.413
- Really?
- What?

54:17.081 --> 54:19.209
"I think you're a good guy"?

54:21.627 --> 54:25.422
I found it hard to get Nate,
so I summarized some impressions.

54:25.422 --> 54:28.467
Right, right, right. Smart.
Really good, Shiv.

54:29.344 --> 54:31.763
But you lied. Right?

54:32.305 --> 54:36.225
She didn't get anything from Nate.
She didn't speak to Nate.

54:36.225 --> 54:38.144
And she's in with Matsson.

54:38.144 --> 54:41.272
- Sorry, what?
- No, I...

54:42.190 --> 54:46.151
No, I did what we all agreed to,

54:46.151 --> 54:48.153
I got close to him,
so that I could help.

54:48.153 --> 54:50.573
Shiv's fucking us, right?
Right, Shivy?

54:50.573 --> 54:53.118
No. No, no, no, no.

54:53.118 --> 54:54.369
I...

54:55.160 --> 54:57.414
I fucking asked you
some real questions, Shiv.

54:57.414 --> 55:00.332
I wondered why you looked like
a goose trying to shit a house brick,

55:00.332 --> 55:01.668
you piece of dirt.

55:01.668 --> 55:03.877
You got yourself
a little fucking side deal here?

55:03.877 --> 55:05.755
No, no, I have some options.

55:05.755 --> 55:09.633
I was going through with the plan,
and then you two...

55:09.633 --> 55:11.553
Mencken.
Mencken, right?

55:11.553 --> 55:13.054
- Mencken.
- No, what?

55:13.054 --> 55:14.472
Tom!

55:14.472 --> 55:17.851
No, you even wanted to push us
out of fucking nest.

55:17.851 --> 55:19.101
Please.

55:19.101 --> 55:22.104
Ken, aside from all this,
this is not the right thing.

55:22.104 --> 55:23.647
Aside from the fact that you lied to us

55:23.647 --> 55:26.442
and that doing what you want precisely
plays into your own interests, yeah?

55:26.442 --> 55:28.402
This doesn't? Yeah?

55:28.402 --> 55:31.113
Ken, please, come on.
Come on!

55:31.113 --> 55:32.324
Who are we?

55:32.324 --> 55:35.159
- Will no one think of the children?
- I'm not gonna let this happen.

55:35.159 --> 55:37.412
There comes a time
where you have to stand...

55:40.206 --> 55:41.666
Seriously, this is real, okay?

55:41.666 --> 55:43.918
I have concern for the state
of the republic

55:43.918 --> 55:47.047
and pluralism
and the future of this country...

55:47.505 --> 55:49.798
You're such a bore Shiv, Jesus.

55:50.382 --> 55:52.677
Fuck you! Ken.

55:52.677 --> 55:55.512
- He's right.
- Yeah, you're boring.

55:55.512 --> 55:57.139
And you don't have a pass for in here.

55:57.139 --> 56:00.435
Okay, well, fine. You know what?
Maybe I'll go public.

56:00.435 --> 56:03.730
I'll go to the papers and tell them
what you're actually fucking doing.

56:03.730 --> 56:05.565
If we're gonna just be hysterical,

56:05.565 --> 56:07.776
we're gonna have to ask you to leave.

56:07.776 --> 56:10.027
People are trying to do
some serious work in here.

56:10.027 --> 56:12.696
Fuck you. This is about
the future of the country.

56:13.573 --> 56:16.242
No, I think it's because
you broke up with your boyfriend.

56:16.743 --> 56:18.952
- Jesus, you're a prick.
- Hello.

56:19.536 --> 56:20.579
Hey, Tom.

56:20.579 --> 56:22.499
So, call it.
You can call it.

56:22.499 --> 56:24.667
- No.
- We're calling it?

56:24.667 --> 56:26.794
Yeah, we called Wisconsin.
Now we're gonna call Arizona,

56:26.794 --> 56:28.462
so we call the election.
We call the election?

56:28.462 --> 56:29.589
Call it.

56:29.589 --> 56:32.591
No, Tom, no.
You're making a terrible mistake.

56:33.218 --> 56:36.930
- Please don't.
- Hey, guys, it's not my call.

56:37.346 --> 56:39.516
It's your call.
It's up to you.

56:39.516 --> 56:42.227
- If you say so, I say so.
- I say so.

56:42.227 --> 56:46.231
- Fucking Pontious Pilate!
- No one cares.

56:46.231 --> 56:48.107
Hey.
Tell them I'm coming down.

56:48.107 --> 56:51.987
Yes. We're gonna call it.
Yeah, we're calling from Mencken.

56:51.987 --> 56:53.738
Okay, tell them I'm coming.

56:54.988 --> 56:57.284
- Great work, Tom.
- Thank you.

56:59.201 --> 57:00.954
Good stuff. Great night.

57:07.376 --> 57:09.003
Fuck!

57:09.337 --> 57:11.339
You okay?

57:11.339 --> 57:13.090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:14.426 --> 57:17.762
I have to go tell them

57:18.555 --> 57:20.765
we're calling it. For Mencken.

57:21.683 --> 57:22.934
Yeah.

57:24.143 --> 57:28.397
So, I should go.
I'll get in trouble if I don't go.

57:29.065 --> 57:31.151
Okay, dude. I mean...

57:32.652 --> 57:35.029
I mean, it's not really
my choice, right?

57:35.029 --> 57:37.781
Sure. I mean, right. Yeah.

57:38.533 --> 57:41.410
Yeah, I'm just pressing the button.
Or I'm not even pressing the button.

57:41.410 --> 57:45.122
I'm asking them to prepare
to press the button.

57:45.122 --> 57:50.003
And this is just like
launch a nuclear attack.

57:51.670 --> 57:56.884
It's not gonna change
anything if I don't go. So...

57:56.884 --> 58:00.179
- A couple minutes.
- Right, right.

58:01.138 --> 58:02.848
Realistically...

58:09.773 --> 58:12.859
- Crazy.
- Yeah.

58:14.402 --> 58:15.778
Crazy one.

58:22.410 --> 58:26.205
So Tom just told me. Everybody,

58:26.705 --> 58:29.958
calling it from Mencken.
He's calling it from Mencken.

58:32.544 --> 58:34.421
- So he said, yeah?
- I just said.

58:34.421 --> 58:36.674
I'm calling it from Mencken.
Okay?

58:38.969 --> 58:40.595
- Okay.
- Okay.

58:42.138 --> 58:44.390
Okay. Well, then, Dave...

58:44.390 --> 58:47.310
Okay. Lydia, get me
"Mencken wins".

58:47.310 --> 58:49.896
Get the ticker going on ATN citizens.

58:49.896 --> 58:53.190
Let the people know two mins
and ATN is gonna call it.

58:53.984 --> 58:56.026
We are gonna make this call now.

58:56.026 --> 58:59.364
The ATN decision desk
has looked at the numbers

58:59.364 --> 59:03.952
and is ready to declare Arizona
for Jeryd Mencken.

59:04.536 --> 59:09.666
This means that Mencken will be
the next president of the United States,

59:09.666 --> 59:12.919
winning the most unreal, surreal
election we have ever seen.

59:12.919 --> 59:16.213
His candidacy starting in Virginia
only six months ago

59:16.213 --> 59:18.591
against a dozen other Republican candidates

59:18.591 --> 59:22.262
in the wake of the president saying
he wasn't going to run for reelection.

59:22.262 --> 59:25.974
What started off as an unlikely impossibility,

59:25.974 --> 59:28.518
now a reality, it is Mencken.

59:29.602 --> 59:35.441
Well, it's now clear I have
won sufficient electoral votes

59:36.150 --> 59:40.488
to be declared the next president
of the United States.

59:41.656 --> 59:44.743
And I find the responsibility awesome.

59:46.161 --> 59:48.078
Now I know there
are some who feel

59:48.078 --> 59:51.665
there's something left
to contest, but votes have been cast.

59:51.665 --> 59:53.250
Votes have been tallied.

59:54.335 --> 59:59.465
On another day, in another time, they
might have fallen in another fashion.

01:00:00.342 --> 01:00:04.720
The election has been called
by an authority of known integrity.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.806
Maybe we should get
like a history guy.

01:00:08.183 --> 01:00:11.811
Like a real brainiac to say

01:00:11.811 --> 01:00:15.272
why this sort of thing has happened
in the past

01:00:15.272 --> 01:00:17.649
and that it'll all be fine.

01:00:17.649 --> 01:00:21.279
To my critics,
I am not a demagogue.

01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:25.491
I am a defender of democracy.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:31.955
But democracy, it has this tendency
that we have to beware

01:00:31.955 --> 01:00:34.375
to become mere transaction.

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:37.670
I give you this, you give me that.

01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:42.675
I come begging for your vote,
welfare checkbook out,

01:00:42.675 --> 01:00:45.762
crowning the welfare kings
and queens

01:00:45.762 --> 01:00:49.349
till everyone's become a little tyrant
crowned by the state.

01:00:50.266 --> 01:00:52.101
The model that I follow

01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:54.437
isn't from the scorched marketplace

01:00:54.437 --> 01:00:58.692
where cunning men
haggle for the best price.

01:00:58.692 --> 01:00:59.983
That's not me.

01:00:59.983 --> 01:01:05.365
The democracy I believe in is where
a leader emerged from the people,

01:01:05.365 --> 01:01:08.702
willed almost into being,
brought forth

01:01:08.702 --> 01:01:12.664
by the great sweetness
of the virtue of the combined wisdom

01:01:12.664 --> 01:01:15.582
of the good people of this republic.

01:01:16.835 --> 01:01:23.216
Don't we long sometimes for something
clean once in this polluted land?

01:01:23.216 --> 01:01:25.009
That's what I hope to bring.

01:01:25.009 --> 01:01:27.511
Not something grubby
with compromise.

01:01:27.511 --> 01:01:30.598
Something clean
and true and refreshing.

01:01:30.598 --> 01:01:32.976
He's a guy we can do business with.

01:01:32.976 --> 01:01:34.227
Yeah.

01:01:34.227 --> 01:01:35.394
Something proud and pure.

01:01:35.394 --> 01:01:38.398
He'll play ball. You should hear him
talk semiconductors.

01:01:38.898 --> 01:01:41.026
The market's holding the leash.

01:01:41.026 --> 01:01:44.403
We just made a night of good TV.
That's what we've done.

01:01:44.403 --> 01:01:46.031
Nothing happens.

01:01:46.031 --> 01:01:48.825
Things do happen, Rome.

01:01:55.205 --> 01:01:57.042
President calling.

01:01:58.543 --> 01:02:02.881
Yo, Hocus POTUS, sitting
in the POTUS position. What's up?

01:02:02.881 --> 01:02:05.758
Hey man, look, no time, just thanks.

01:02:05.758 --> 01:02:08.053
You and me, man, we'll go far.

01:02:08.053 --> 01:02:10.013
Over the road and into the bar.

01:02:11.556 --> 01:02:14.058
An election unlike anything
we've ever seen.

01:02:14.058 --> 01:02:16.143
followed by a speech for the ages.

01:02:16.143 --> 01:02:19.064
The legal process
is gonna be lengthy.

01:02:19.064 --> 01:02:20.856
When do you think it'll all be over?

01:02:20.856 --> 01:02:23.400
This could be going on
for the next three months.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.905
Hey, Tom, your phone,
it's red hot, Tom.

01:02:26.905 --> 01:02:29.156
A lot of very important people...

01:02:30.157 --> 01:02:32.701
A lot of very important
people wanna scream at you.

01:02:33.952 --> 01:02:36.164
This is a little pointed.

01:02:36.164 --> 01:02:39.376
The call was made personally
by ATN boss Tom Wambsgans.

01:02:39.376 --> 01:02:41.920
Darwin wants to know
when to do his caveats.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.631
Is there time for him to do it?
No.

01:02:49.468 --> 01:02:51.136
Hello? No.

01:02:53.932 --> 01:02:57.143
He is, of course, known to be
an associate of Jeryd Mencken.

01:02:57.143 --> 01:03:00.188
Jesus fucking Christ,
what's going on ?

01:03:00.188 --> 01:03:02.481
Those funky numbers,
I'm sending you words, yeah?

01:03:02.481 --> 01:03:05.734
Let's get 'em out in the next 24.
A lot of fucking news.

01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:07.529
You guys are crazy.

01:03:07.529 --> 01:03:09.822
Yeah, it's more than
just fucking crazy, Lukas.

01:03:09.822 --> 01:03:12.825
No, but this is crazy!

01:03:12.825 --> 01:03:14.828
Well, we're gonna do a number on 'em.

01:03:14.828 --> 01:03:17.746
We're gonna fuck them so hard,
we're gonna fix this, yeah?

01:03:18.456 --> 01:03:19.665
Fuck!

01:03:22.334 --> 01:03:24.003
Can I come see the kids?

01:03:24.629 --> 01:03:26.046
They're asleep.

01:03:26.505 --> 01:03:29.216
Well, I can wait up for them.

01:03:29.216 --> 01:03:32.344
I should be asleep, but I can't.

01:03:32.344 --> 01:03:36.390
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll see you at the funeral, okay?

01:03:47.527 --> 01:03:49.945
Some people just can't cut a deal, Fikret.
