there's over 7,500 islands

03:35.582 --> 03:36.616

a one to nothing lead.

The tiebreaker, we did it.
We did it.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.022

- We did it!

17:03.890 --> 17:05.358

- Oh, my God!

17:08.328 --> 17:09.662
- Whoo!
- Wow.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.031
- Great clue.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.032
Great clue.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.433
- I'm very excited

17:13.466 --> 17:15.502
because our contestants
are tied

17:15.535 --> 17:16.670
at one game apiece,

17:16.703 --> 17:18.505
which means
we go to a tiebreaker!

17:18.538 --> 17:20.040
It's sudden death.

17:21.841 --> 17:24.544
Our very special guests
are gonna sit this one out.

17:24.577 --> 17:28.281
It's Eamon versus Sandy
in a head-to-head showdown

17:28.314 --> 17:30.550
for a chance to play
for 25 grand.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.818
And here's how it works.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.421
I will reveal
a total of five clues

17:34.454 --> 17:37.323
to a final password
one word at a time.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.059
As soon as you think you know
the password,

17:39.059 --> 17:40.360
you gotta buzz in.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.729
If you're right, you move on
to the bonus round.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.864
But if you guess incorrectly,

17:44.898 --> 17:46.433
your opponent
will be allowed to see

17:46.466 --> 17:48.268
the rest of the remaining clues

17:48.301 --> 17:50.070
and make a final guess.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.439
It's risk versus reward.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.640
Understood?

17:53.673 --> 17:54.908
both: Yes.
- Let's do it!

Up on your feet!

Your first clue is...

18:06.519 --> 18:08.021
"love."

18:08.054 --> 18:11.758
The first clue is "love."

18:11.791 --> 18:15.328
The second clue is "fuzzy."

18:15.362 --> 18:17.931
Second clue is "fuzzy."

18:18.031 --> 18:21.668
Third clue is "ball."

18:21.701 --> 18:23.103
Love.

18:23.136 --> 18:25.038
Fuzzy. And ball.

18:25.038 --> 18:26.239

to get really weird.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.307
- Yeah, yeah.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.743
- The fourth clue is...

18:29.776 --> 18:30.877
"court."

18:33.046 --> 18:34.047
Okay.

You nailed it!

I hope you had fun playing
with us tonight.

There's more "Password"

Oh, my gosh, Sandy,

20:04.037 --> 20:06.006
that was so exciting
watching you play.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.140
- Yes.

- Now you have a chance
to win 25 grand.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.043

- What would you do if you won?

20:10.076 --> 20:12.712
- I wanna fly first class back

my husband and my daughter.

- Yeah, all right!

- It's the first class for me,
okay?

20:18.151 --> 20:19.619
- Yes, yes.
- That's yours.

20:19.652 --> 20:20.987
We're gonna try to get you
that trip.

20:21.021 --> 20:22.055
- Thank you.

20:22.088 --> 20:23.123
- Here's
how the bonus round works.

20:23.156 --> 20:24.357
We're gonna give
you ten passwords

20:24.391 --> 20:25.725
beginning with the letter M

20:25.759 --> 20:27.360
and continuing
through each letter

20:27.394 --> 20:28.661
to the letter V.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.263
You will be the clue giver
and start

20:30.296 --> 20:32.332
by choosing one celebrity
to be the guesser.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.635
You'll have 30 seconds to get
as many passwords as you can.

20:35.669 --> 20:38.238
Then we'll take a break,
catch our breath,

20:38.271 --> 20:39.873
and the other celebrity
will take over

20:39.906 --> 20:41.775
to guess
the remaining passwords.

20:41.808 --> 20:45.478
For every one you get correct,
you get $1,000.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.313
But if you sweep the board

20:47.347 --> 20:50.216
and you get all ten,
you'll be going home with...

20:50.250 --> 20:53.019
both: $25,000.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.157
- Yes, yes.
- All right.

20:57.190 --> 21:00.093
So here's the big question,
Sandy.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.062
Which celebrity
do you want to go with first?

21:03.630 --> 21:05.732
- We'll do a Jon.
- All right. Okay.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.833
- All right,
let's get into position.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.201
- Okay.
- You got this.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.936

- All right.

- All right, 30 seconds
on the clock, Sandy.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.344
And remember, after the
contestant gives you a clue,

21:17.377 --> 21:20.547
you can only make one guess
before getting another clue.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.449
If you can't think of a guess,
just say "clue"

21:22.482 --> 21:23.883
so she can give you
another one.

22:02.222 --> 22:04.057
- So the reason why it buzzed

22:04.057 --> 22:05.492
is because you broke a rule,
right?

22:05.525 --> 22:07.160
You said "TV,"
and it's initials.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.329
You still did great!

22:09.362 --> 22:10.497
- All right.
- You got four.

- That's $4,000.

we're gonna take out the word
you messed up on,

22:26.179 --> 22:28.381
and put in a new word that
starts with the same letter

- Breathing in and out.
- Mm-hmm.

22:32.552 --> 22:35.555

- Oh, no, my husband.

25:13.113 --> 25:16.216
I had to lie to him.
He's scared of heights, so...

25:16.249 --> 25:19.052
- So you tricked your husband.
- Ex-husband, right?

25:19.085 --> 25:21.154
- [laughs] Yeah, exactly.
- Current.

25:22.756 --> 25:24.357
- We're so excited
to play with you tonight.

25:24.391 --> 25:25.725
- We got this. We got this.
We got this.

25:25.759 --> 25:26.760
- We can't lose.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.228
- And, Jon, please introduce us

25:28.261 --> 25:29.496
to who you're playing with.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.364
- Well, big fan of yours,
by the way.

25:31.398 --> 25:33.266
- What?
- This is Chantel.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.369
Chantel is a big fan of yours

25:36.403 --> 25:37.704
from Temecula, California,
but--

25:37.737 --> 25:39.139
- But let's go back
to the first part

25:39.172 --> 25:41.074
'cause I love that.
You're a big fan of mine?

25:41.074 --> 25:44.110
- No, no, no, no, he's--
we're gonna move past that.

25:44.144 --> 25:45.345
- Oh, my God.
- We moved past that.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.213
We're talking about Chantel.
- Chantel!

25:47.247 --> 25:49.916
- Keke, I'ma gush a little bit.
- What?

25:49.949 --> 25:51.451
- You are my shero
for real, for real.

25:51.484 --> 25:53.153
- Girl, stop.
- For real, for real.

25:53.186 --> 25:54.554
- Hey.

25:54.587 --> 25:57.157
Well, Chantel, I heard we have
something else in common.

25:57.190 --> 25:59.092
"I Love Lucy"?
- I love Lucy!

25:59.125 --> 26:00.860
- Oh, my gosh.
- I do, I do.

26:00.894 --> 26:04.297
I have to say, I have over 200
"I Love Lucy" collectables.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.732
- Oh, my gosh.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.133
- I have been collecting them
since the fourth grade.

26:07.167 --> 26:09.235
I am now a full-grown woman,
so you can only imagine

26:09.269 --> 26:11.705
how much I've been collecting.
- I love that.

26:11.738 --> 26:12.906
- Thank you, guys,
for being here.

26:12.939 --> 26:15.275
And we're all here to play...

all: "Password"!

wins game one

26:23.550 --> 26:25.485

- All right, Jimmy, you know
you always start us off.

26:34.627 --> 26:35.829
- Okay, here we go.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.197
- So are you playing,
or are you passing?

26:37.230 --> 26:40.700

26:40.734 --> 26:42.502

26:44.104 --> 26:45.238
- He's playing.

26:46.773 --> 26:47.807
He's playing.

26:52.579 --> 26:53.747
- Surfer.

26:55.348 --> 26:56.983
- Bro.

26:57.083 --> 26:58.651
- All right,
that's not the password.

26:58.685 --> 27:02.122
Jon, the first clue was
"surfer."

27:04.491 --> 27:06.393
- Cool.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.369
- Wow.
- Chantel.

27:16.403 --> 27:17.737
[all speaking at once]

27:17.771 --> 27:20.707
I mean, you and Jon
got a nice 5 points there.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.509
- Yeah, great job, Jon.

27:22.542 --> 27:23.643
[all laughing]

27:23.677 --> 27:26.579
That's just how I talk.
Sorry.

27:26.613 --> 27:28.048
- All right,
this is for you, Chantel.

27:28.048 --> 27:30.150
Stephanie, you're trailing.

Whatever you think.
- Playing or passing?

27:37.691 --> 27:39.526
- We're gonna play.
- Play.

27:39.559 --> 27:41.695
- All right, all right.
A risk-taker.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.199
- Spaghetti.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.634
- Meatballs.

27:48.902 --> 27:51.304
- That's not the password.
Back to you, Chantel.

27:51.338 --> 27:52.605
Playing for five points.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.809
- Pasta.

Boom! Boom!

Yeah, we got this!
Hey!

28:04.517 --> 28:06.386
That is--
- Jimmy, they're coming in hot.

28:06.419 --> 28:08.421
- Why would they stand up
for that?

28:08.455 --> 28:10.023
- You came in hot, Jon.

28:10.023 --> 28:11.825
Chantel's in the lead with 10.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.126
- How you feeling, Stephanie?

28:13.159 --> 28:15.161
- Real good. Real good.
- Yeah.

We're fine. We're fine.

28:19.466 --> 28:20.700

or do you wanna pass?

28:20.734 --> 28:22.168

you're here, Jon.

I love you. You got this.

28:37.851 --> 28:39.386
All right, you could take
the game right here.

28:39.419 --> 28:41.454
- We decidedly don't have this,
but...

28:41.488 --> 28:42.722
- Okay.

28:42.756 --> 28:44.157
- Planet.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.011
- Uranus.
- Oh, man!

29:07.580 --> 29:09.849
- Half the crowd stood,
half sat.

29:09.883 --> 29:12.318
I'll take--I'll take the half
that's standing.

29:12.352 --> 29:14.187

You've got 5.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.189
You're still trailing,
so you get to choose.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.733

29:26.766 --> 29:28.234
For the game, Chantel.

29:29.903 --> 29:32.305

29:33.907 --> 29:37.243

down my spine.

29:37.277 --> 29:39.913
- All right, we're back to you,

30:26.126 --> 30:28.094
- Yes, he did.
- Freaked.

30:32.632 --> 30:35.468
Coming to you, Chantel.
It could be for the game.

30:36.703 --> 30:37.771

- Spaz?

30:42.342 --> 30:45.979

Stephanie.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.647

- Yeah!

31:04.064 --> 31:06.366
This is accurate?
Did you have it?

31:06.399 --> 31:07.567
Panic button.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.070
- Man, Jon, "attack"
is such a good clue.

31:10.070 --> 31:11.471
- I thought after "freak"
it would work.

31:11.504 --> 31:13.573
- It was such a good clue.
- Panic attack--oh, my God.

31:13.606 --> 31:14.841

Come on, girl.

31:19.112 --> 31:20.580

Jon Hamm is good at this.

that's not the password.

31:55.248 --> 31:57.751
Coming back to you, Chantel.
This could be game.

31:59.119 --> 32:00.687
- Folding.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.391
Folding.

32:04.424 --> 32:05.792
- Letter?

32:07.594 --> 32:08.661

32:21.808 --> 32:24.644
- No, it's not--
it's not my husband's name.

That was it, Stephanie.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.488
You've won the first round,

32:35.522 --> 32:36.690
but, Chantel, that's okay

32:36.723 --> 32:38.191
because we still got
another round to go.

32:38.224 --> 32:39.325
- Got another round.

32:39.359 --> 32:40.493
- When we return,
we'll switch up the teams

32:40.527 --> 32:41.728
and play game two

32:41.761 --> 32:43.096
to see who can make it
into our bonus round

32:43.129 --> 32:45.765
for a chance at 25 grand.
Stick around.

32:45.799 --> 32:47.934
We'll be right back
with more "Password."

switched partners.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.732
Stephanie won the first game,

33:18.765 --> 33:20.667
but remember,
you have to win two games

out of three showdown

33:22.435 --> 33:23.870
to move on to the bonus round,

So it's go-time, Chantel.
I believe in you.

and I gotta tell you guys,

33:34.714 --> 33:36.349
it's so hard sometimes
not to play along.

33:36.383 --> 33:37.550
I'm so competitive.
- I know.

33:37.584 --> 33:39.619
- I'm thinking
of all types of clues.

33:39.652 --> 33:40.854
- I thought you were gonna say
it's so hard

33:40.887 --> 33:42.589
to be next
to such a good-looking man.

33:42.622 --> 33:43.923
- That's also a very difficult.

33:43.957 --> 33:46.493
- That's also so hard
to be by you, Jon Hamm.

33:46.526 --> 33:48.561
- Thank you very much.
- I tell you what.

33:48.595 --> 33:50.497
- Very kind, very kind.

33:50.530 --> 33:51.865
- All right, Jimmy.
- All right, here we go.

33:51.898 --> 33:53.233
- You starting us out, my man.

33:53.266 --> 33:55.402
Do you wanna play,
or do you wanna pass?

33:55.435 --> 33:57.704
<i>- The password is goal.</i>

34:03.209 --> 34:05.345
- Just hold that face for
the rest of the show, Jimmy.

34:05.378 --> 34:07.414
[laughter]

34:07.447 --> 34:10.483
- I'm going to pass
and let Jon Hamm

34:10.517 --> 34:12.052
get a crack at that.
- All right.

34:12.052 --> 34:14.521
- Good strategy.
- Going to you, Jon.

34:14.554 --> 34:15.588
- All right.

34:17.824 --> 34:19.059
Kick.

34:23.763 --> 34:25.865
- Ball?

34:25.899 --> 34:27.367
- All right,
that wasn't the password.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.568
We're coming back to you,
Jimmy.

34:28.601 --> 34:32.639
The first clue was kick.
Playing for five points.

34:34.574 --> 34:37.444
- Soccer!

34:37.477 --> 34:39.679
- Goal.
- Yeah, that's right!

34:39.713 --> 34:40.847
- Yes!

34:43.149 --> 34:45.552
- Why "soccer!"

34:45.585 --> 34:48.988
- Just sometimes I get excited!

34:49.089 --> 34:52.292
- But it worked. It worked.
- Oh!

34:52.325 --> 34:54.494
Chantel, you got five points.
You're on the board.

34:54.527 --> 34:57.297
- Yes!
- First to 15 wins.

34:57.330 --> 34:58.965
It's on you, Stephanie.

34:58.998 --> 35:00.867
Since you're trailing,
you do the honors.

35:00.900 --> 35:02.635
Do you wanna play,
or do you wanna pass?

35:02.669 --> 35:04.170
<i>- The password is...</i>

35:04.204 --> 35:05.505
<i>mirror.</i>

35:07.841 --> 35:09.776
- I'll play.
- Oh, she's feeling good.

35:09.809 --> 35:11.244
She's playing.
- Mm.

35:13.213 --> 35:14.547
- Reflection.

35:14.581 --> 35:15.815
- Mirror.
- Yes!

35:20.353 --> 35:21.888
- Now, Jon.

35:21.921 --> 35:23.523
- Jon.
- Jon.

35:23.556 --> 35:25.825
- Wow.
- That was a record time.

35:25.859 --> 35:27.794
- Wow, that's record.
- She barely said reflection--

35:27.827 --> 35:29.062
mirror.
- Mirror, yep.

35:29.062 --> 35:30.764
- My first--
where I immediately went to

35:30.797 --> 35:32.832
when I hear "reflection"
is Jimmy Fallon.

35:32.866 --> 35:34.334
- Yeah, we look...
- We look--

35:34.367 --> 35:35.502
- Like we're twins.
- We're like twins.

35:35.535 --> 35:36.870
- Yeah.

35:36.903 --> 35:38.271
- Jimmy tells me that
every time I'm on his show.

35:38.304 --> 35:39.673
- I tell him every time.
Exactly, I really do.

35:39.706 --> 35:41.241
- All right, we got five.
We got six.

35:41.274 --> 35:43.143
We're just in the beginning.
It's close, right?

35:43.176 --> 35:44.678
- Whoo!
- First to 15 wins.

35:44.711 --> 35:47.080
You're trailing
over here on this side,

35:47.080 --> 35:49.282
so, Jimmy, you do the honors.
You wanna play or pass?

35:49.315 --> 35:50.817
<i>- The password is...</i>

35:50.850 --> 35:52.318
<i>shining.</i>
- Ooh.

35:56.089 --> 35:57.957
- Lot of ways to go with this.

35:59.192 --> 36:02.195
- Lot of ways.
- Lot of ways to go with it.

36:02.228 --> 36:04.030
- So exciting.

36:05.031 --> 36:06.566
- [as Jack Nicholson]
Johnny.

36:08.835 --> 36:10.670
- Oh.

36:10.704 --> 36:11.905
- Johnny.

36:16.176 --> 36:17.911
- That's a way.

36:17.944 --> 36:20.747
That's a way.
- Johnny.

36:22.048 --> 36:23.750
Johnny.

36:25.085 --> 36:28.722
Johnny.
- Jack.

36:28.755 --> 36:30.357
Like Jack Nicholson?

36:30.390 --> 36:31.858
Were you saying like,
"Here comes Johnny?"

36:31.891 --> 36:32.859
That's was it was...

36:32.892 --> 36:35.895
- Does seem like that.
- Right?

36:35.929 --> 36:37.197
- Movie.

36:37.230 --> 36:38.531
- Shining.

36:38.565 --> 36:40.300
Whoo!

36:40.333 --> 36:42.702
- Here comes Johnny
in "The Shining."

36:42.736 --> 36:44.471
Oh, man!

36:44.504 --> 36:46.072
I was going
for the character...

36:46.072 --> 36:47.340
- I know.
- Not the movie.

36:47.374 --> 36:48.575
- But you told him.

36:48.608 --> 36:49.809
You're like,
"You're doing Jack Nicholson."

36:49.843 --> 36:51.111
Oh.
- I knew it.

36:51.144 --> 36:52.645
- That was so scary.
- There you go.

36:52.679 --> 36:54.214
- You did it.
- Give me you.

36:54.247 --> 36:56.516
- But by the way, that was
such a good impression.

36:56.549 --> 36:58.251
[as Jack Nicholson]
"Johnny."

36:58.284 --> 36:59.519
You impress me every day,
Jimmy.

36:59.552 --> 37:01.021
You impress me every day.

37:01.021 --> 37:02.022
- [as Jack Nicholson]
I don't know

37:02.055 --> 37:03.023
what you're talking about.

37:03.056 --> 37:05.191
[laughter]

37:05.225 --> 37:06.893
- All right,
we got 5 over here, Chantel.

37:06.926 --> 37:09.362
We got 11 over here, Stephanie.

37:09.396 --> 37:12.265
Chantel, I want you
to force this tiebreaker.

37:12.298 --> 37:15.335
It's a close game,
but first to 15 wins.

37:15.368 --> 37:17.671
Starting with you.

37:17.704 --> 37:19.272
Do you wanna play,
or do you wanna pass?

37:19.305 --> 37:20.674
<i>- The password is...</i>

37:20.707 --> 37:21.908
<i>Tesla.</i>

37:24.310 --> 37:25.645
- I'm gonna play.

37:25.679 --> 37:27.380
- All right, she's gonna play.
- Whoo!

37:27.414 --> 37:28.515
- Love that!

37:30.316 --> 37:32.218
- Elon.

37:34.254 --> 37:35.689
- Musk.

37:37.590 --> 37:40.860
- Oh, this could be

37:40.894 --> 37:43.263
for the game.

37:44.597 --> 37:46.066
- Vehicle.

37:47.667 --> 37:49.235
- Tesla.
- Yes!

37:49.269 --> 37:51.671
[cheering and applause]

37:51.705 --> 37:54.341
- You got it.
You got it, Stephanie.

37:54.374 --> 37:56.076
- You got it, oh.

37:57.310 --> 37:59.412
- You did a great job, Chantel.
- That was a good one.

37:59.446 --> 38:00.747
- Stephanie,
congratulations to you.

38:00.780 --> 38:01.915
You've won the game,

38:02.015 --> 38:02.916
and you're heading
to the bonus round.

38:03.016 --> 38:04.150
Don't go anywhere.

38:04.184 --> 38:06.920
We'll play for 25 grand
when we come back.

38:10.190 --> 38:11.691
- I'm so glad
I got to play with you,

38:11.725 --> 38:13.360
we got a chance to meet.
- It's so nice to meet you.

38:13.393 --> 38:14.561
- Me too.
- I got to meet you, it's fine.

38:18.598 --> 38:18.798
.

38:18.832 --> 38:19.199
<i>[cheerful music]</i>

38:21.701 --> 38:23.403
<i>* *</i>

38:23.436 --> 38:25.305
- Welcome back to "Password."

38:25.338 --> 38:26.639
Stephanie has won our game

38:26.673 --> 38:28.641
and now has a chance to play
with the twins,

38:28.675 --> 38:30.610
Jimmy Fallon and Jon Hamm,

38:30.643 --> 38:32.545
to win 25 grand.

38:32.579 --> 38:34.414
[cheers and applause]

38:34.447 --> 38:37.650
Stephanie, it's the thrill
of the moment.

38:37.684 --> 38:38.785
I know you love a thrill.

38:38.818 --> 38:40.954
The thrill now is to win
25 grand.

38:41.054 --> 38:43.056
What would you do
if you won it?

38:43.056 --> 38:45.558
- So I'm Cuban and...
- Ooh.

38:45.592 --> 38:46.893
- As are my parents.

38:46.926 --> 38:49.662
They migrated here
at a very young age from Cuba.

38:49.696 --> 38:51.297
They haven't been back since.

38:51.331 --> 38:54.434
So I'm gonna see
if I can convince them

38:54.467 --> 38:56.302
to go back and show me
their hometowns

38:56.336 --> 38:58.705
of Santiago and Cienfuegos.

38:58.738 --> 39:00.306
- Oh, my gosh,
that sounds beautiful.

39:00.340 --> 39:02.242
Vacation and a little,
you know,

39:02.275 --> 39:03.309
way back to history
and your roots.

39:03.343 --> 39:04.477
I love it.

39:04.511 --> 39:06.112
Well, here's
how the bonus round works.

39:06.146 --> 39:07.547
We're gonna give you
ten passwords

39:07.580 --> 39:08.682
beginning with the letter L

39:08.715 --> 39:10.150
and continuing
through each letter

39:10.183 --> 39:11.251
to the letter U.

39:11.284 --> 39:12.619
You will be the clue giver

39:12.652 --> 39:15.055
and start by choosing one
celebrity to be the guesser.

39:15.088 --> 39:18.258
You'll have 30 seconds to get
as many passwords as you can,

39:18.291 --> 39:20.193
then we'll take a break,
you'll catch your breath,

39:20.226 --> 39:21.761
and then the other celebrity
will come in

39:21.795 --> 39:23.930
and try to guess
the remaining passwords

39:24.030 --> 39:25.198
within 30 seconds.

39:25.231 --> 39:27.334
Every correct answer you get,
you get a grand,

39:27.367 --> 39:30.136
but if you sweep the board
and you get all ten,

39:30.170 --> 39:32.038
then you'll be going home
with 25 grand.

39:32.038 --> 39:33.606
- Whoo!

39:33.640 --> 39:37.277
- All right, which celebrity
you wanna go with first?

39:37.310 --> 39:38.411
- I'm gonna start off
with Jimmy.

39:38.445 --> 39:40.914
- Oh, yeah, all right!

39:40.947 --> 39:42.082
- Bring it home.
- Gotta close it.

39:42.115 --> 39:43.316
- If we need it.
If we need it.

39:43.350 --> 39:45.051
Let's do this, bud.
We got this. We got this.

39:45.085 --> 39:46.186
- I need to change my juju.

39:46.219 --> 39:47.921
- You got it.
Yep, of course.

39:47.954 --> 39:48.955
- All right.

39:49.055 --> 39:50.724
30 seconds on the clock,
Stephanie.

39:50.757 --> 39:51.825
Jimmy, you know the deal.

39:51.858 --> 39:53.093
All you gotta do
is look over there

39:53.126 --> 39:54.728
to see what letter
each password begins with,

39:54.761 --> 39:57.230
but remember,
Stephanie gives you one clue,

39:57.263 --> 39:58.264
and then you guess.

39:58.298 --> 39:59.499
If you can't think
of nothing else,

39:59.532 --> 40:00.633
you have to say "clue"
so she can give you

40:00.667 --> 40:01.701
another clue, okay?
- Got you, yep.

40:01.735 --> 40:03.269
- First one starts with L,
Jimmy, L.

40:03.303 --> 40:04.471
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

40:04.504 --> 40:05.505
That's a good hint.
That's a good hint.

40:05.538 --> 40:06.906
- Should I yell them out
as we go,

40:06.940 --> 40:08.641
or can you see them okay?
- No, you're not loud enough.

40:08.675 --> 40:11.478
- Okay, we're good.
- Only Stephanie can pass.

40:11.511 --> 40:14.347
I believe in you both.
On your marks, get set, go.

40:14.381 --> 40:16.149
- Early.
- Late.

40:16.182 --> 40:18.752
- Day.

40:18.785 --> 40:20.186
- Clue.

40:20.220 --> 40:23.056

- Oval.

40:27.227 --> 40:29.496
- Puppy.

40:29.529 --> 40:31.197

40:31.231 --> 40:33.033

40:39.005 --> 40:40.740
- Quick.

40:40.774 --> 40:42.642
Quiz.

40:42.676 --> 40:43.810
- Dressing.

40:43.843 --> 40:44.878
- Russian.
[buzzer sounds]

40:48.548 --> 40:50.116
- Yeah!

40:51.584 --> 40:53.520
Yeah!

40:53.553 --> 40:56.222
- Very, very good.

40:56.256 --> 40:57.590
You got five correct,

40:57.624 --> 40:59.959
bringing you
to a total of $5,000.

41:00.060 --> 41:02.328
That's yours to keep
no matter what,

41:02.362 --> 41:05.398
but we're gonna try to get you
to the 25 grand.

41:05.432 --> 41:07.367
Jon Hamm, you're up next,
my man.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.501
- All right, come on now.
Come on.

41:08.535 --> 41:11.304
- Jon Hamm!
Take it home, buddy.

41:11.338 --> 41:14.341
- You have
five remaining passwords.

41:14.374 --> 41:16.076
That's R, S, T, U,

41:16.076 --> 41:18.378
then you're gonna go back
and get the N, okay?

41:18.411 --> 41:19.946
And I just wanna say,

41:19.979 --> 41:21.414
if you need a pass, pass.

41:21.448 --> 41:23.850
It's only 30 seconds, so you
got time to go in a circle

41:23.883 --> 41:25.151
as many times as you want,

41:25.185 --> 41:26.886
but you wanna make sure
you can get up that time.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.154
All right,

41:28.188 --> 41:30.824
you're 30 seconds away
from a $25,000 payday.

41:30.857 --> 41:32.859
30 seconds on the clock.

41:32.892 --> 41:34.594
On your marks, get set, go.

41:34.627 --> 41:36.930
- Dip.
- Robe?

41:36.963 --> 41:38.665
