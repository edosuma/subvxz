05:55.994 --> 05:57.109
Easy.

06:22.314 --> 06:23.633
Easy, girl.

06:32.114 --> 06:33.467
Easy, girl.

06:34.954 --> 06:36.182
Easy.

06:36.434 --> 06:37.662
Hold it, girl.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.062
Hold it.

06:45.554 --> 06:48.148
Well, I want each of you fellas...

06:48.234 --> 06:51.783
...to buy yourself a $1 Ingersoll watch.

06:51.914 --> 06:53.905
You can't break 'em with a hammer and...

06:54.034 --> 06:56.628
...won't lose more than a minute a month.

06:57.114 --> 07:00.072
-I know we're late, Mr. Andersen.
-You're two hours late!

07:00.154 --> 07:02.714
Work starts around here at 6:00 a.m.

07:02.794 --> 07:04.386
-Goes for everybody.
-Yes, sir.

07:04.474 --> 07:05.907
We spent the night in Bozeman.

07:05.994 --> 07:07.586
Town's empty as a bone orchard.

07:07.714 --> 07:09.432
Everybody's lit out for the Ruby River.

07:09.514 --> 07:11.311
-What for?
-Gold.

07:11.394 --> 07:12.907
At the Ruby?

07:13.034 --> 07:14.387
Played out years ago.

07:14.474 --> 07:16.942
No. This is a new strike.
About 20 miles above there.

07:17.034 --> 07:19.468
Almost to the Beaverhead.
Tell him, Smiley.

07:20.514 --> 07:23.074
Well, the fact is,
me and the boys thought...

07:23.154 --> 07:26.271
...we'd like to take a ride up
and have ourselves a little look-see.

07:26.354 --> 07:31.064
Got 1,500 head o' steer to get
to Belle Fourche before it snows on me.

07:31.514 --> 07:33.311
You're hired on to move 'em.

07:34.314 --> 07:37.033
-We'd like to help you out--
-LLike to help me out?

07:37.994 --> 07:39.427
The others done pulled out.

07:40.914 --> 07:42.711
There's only five of us left.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.433
That busts it.

07:44.514 --> 07:46.869
You work us night and day,
and Christmas, too!

07:46.954 --> 07:49.514
-Pay ya every Saturday!
-There's easier money around.

07:49.634 --> 07:50.783
We'll do it this way.

07:50.874 --> 07:53.991
We'll take a ride up there and look around,
two or three weeks.

07:54.114 --> 07:56.992
If it don't work,
we'll get the others and come right back.

07:57.074 --> 07:58.905
You have my word on that.
Don't he, boys?

07:58.994 --> 07:59.710
That's right.

07:59.794 --> 08:01.352
-Your word?
-Yes, sir.

08:01.634 --> 08:03.113
Well, here's my word.

08:03.674 --> 08:05.665
Get the hell off my spread!

08:06.554 --> 08:07.543
Now!

08:15.714 --> 08:16.829
Miserable.

08:28.114 --> 08:29.388
Well, they run...

08:29.954 --> 08:32.946
...clean out from under me.
Whole damn bunch of 'em.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.673
I heard most of it. LLet me see that.

08:38.714 --> 08:41.706
A fool comes to town
with a fistful of gold dust and...

08:41.794 --> 08:45.230
...every jackass in 50 miles around
lights out after him.

08:46.514 --> 08:49.312
My day a man'd stay with you
on a handshake.

08:49.914 --> 08:51.472
It's a different day, Wil.

08:51.594 --> 08:52.709
Yeah.

08:53.314 --> 08:57.068
Well, I guess I'll go over to
the Bigelow place, see what I can turn up.

08:57.474 --> 08:58.623
Maybe Henry....

08:58.714 --> 09:00.830
Henry Bigelow's 60 years old, Wil.

09:02.874 --> 09:03.943
So am I.

09:28.954 --> 09:30.865
Kinda noisy around here.

09:31.194 --> 09:33.230
It's been like this all week.

09:33.914 --> 09:35.108
Any luck?

09:36.514 --> 09:37.469
No.

09:39.354 --> 09:41.424
I traveled 30 miles today...

09:42.354 --> 09:44.743
...didn't find a single hand that could...

09:45.914 --> 09:47.427
...throw in with me.

09:49.194 --> 09:51.185
-Did you talk to Parker?
-Yeah.

09:52.194 --> 09:53.946
His wife's gonna have a baby.

09:54.754 --> 09:56.028
How about Miller?

09:56.514 --> 09:58.425
His wife wants to have a baby.

09:58.994 --> 10:01.383
Sucker's only been married three weeks.

10:15.834 --> 10:19.827
Well, if you can't get your cattle
to market this year, put it off till next.

10:20.914 --> 10:23.223
What'll I do with this year's bills?

10:23.794 --> 10:27.025
Pay 'em next year.
Hell, a lot of folks around here do.

10:27.154 --> 10:29.031
No, I won't go on tick.

10:33.794 --> 10:35.785
If your neck was any stiffer...

10:35.914 --> 10:38.872
...you couldn't even bend over
to pull your boots on!

10:42.274 --> 10:43.866
Shut up and pour!

11:01.874 --> 11:03.990
Did ya ever think of hirin' boys?

11:04.394 --> 11:05.463
What boys?

11:05.594 --> 11:06.743
The schoolboys.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.904
Oh, sure, and women.

11:09.074 --> 11:12.589
How about my momma in Cedar City?
She's only 92.

11:13.114 --> 11:15.070
You ain't got a lot of choices.

11:15.234 --> 11:17.873
There ain't a kid in that school over 15.

11:17.954 --> 11:20.514
They're between hay and grass.
I need men.

11:20.834 --> 11:23.428
How old was you when you went
on your first cattle drive?

11:23.514 --> 11:26.233
-What difference does that make?
-How old was you, Wil?

11:26.314 --> 11:28.225
-Well, in my day--
-How old?

11:28.554 --> 11:29.748
Thirteen.

11:30.274 --> 11:32.265
And my old man's pants fit me.

11:32.594 --> 11:34.550
''This convenient arrangement
is designed...

11:34.634 --> 11:37.432
''...to adjust ladies' long dresses
to a walking length.

11:38.194 --> 11:40.788
''It is worn around the waist,

11:44.434 --> 11:45.583
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

11:45.674 --> 11:47.232
'Afternoon, Miss Ellen.

11:47.634 --> 11:50.944
Have you gentlemen decided
you need some additional schooling?

11:51.314 --> 11:54.989
Well, I guess we could probably use some,
but we just come visitin'.

11:55.474 --> 11:56.748
Well, come in.

11:57.954 --> 11:59.353
Please, sit down.

12:14.994 --> 12:16.586
It isn't often we get visitors.

12:18.034 --> 12:20.548
We were reading
from the Montgomery Ward Catalogue.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.350
The grammar's quite correct
and it's always most interesting.

12:25.034 --> 12:27.309
Elizabeth, would you continue, please?

12:29.154 --> 12:31.463
''...the longer of which has a nickel clasp...

12:31.554 --> 12:35.308
''...which holds the bottom
of the skirt to any desirable height...

12:35.394 --> 12:37.862
''...the shorter one,
a hook for holding a fan.

12:38.114 --> 12:41.789
''This elevator has been worn in Chicago
during the past season a great deal...

12:41.874 --> 12:44.547
''...and ladies consider it
almost indispensable.''

12:44.634 --> 12:46.067
Thank you, Elizabeth.

12:46.314 --> 12:49.624
Now, let us hear how well the boys do.

12:49.874 --> 12:52.911
Put away your catalogues
and take out your readers.

12:57.074 --> 12:58.393
Charles Hunnicutt.

12:58.674 --> 13:01.029
Would you read today's assignment for us?

13:09.634 --> 13:11.909
''Hail to thee, blith--''

13:13.074 --> 13:14.189
Blith?

13:15.754 --> 13:16.869
Blithe.

13:17.594 --> 13:20.950
''...blithe spirit, bird thou never wert.''

13:22.314 --> 13:23.303
Weren't?

13:24.434 --> 13:26.152
''Bird thou never wert.''

13:30.314 --> 13:32.953
''That from heaven or near it
Pourest thy--''

13:33.434 --> 13:34.469
Get away!

13:34.554 --> 13:35.987
-What have you got?
-Nothing.

13:36.074 --> 13:39.111
Homer, take your hand
from behind your back!

13:42.594 --> 13:43.743
And open it!

13:49.474 --> 13:51.783
Stop it! Now stop it!

13:52.074 --> 13:53.189
Sit down!

14:15.874 --> 14:17.148
Give it up, Wil.

14:17.714 --> 14:19.466
Can't move heaven and earth.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.509
Well....

14:24.154 --> 14:25.712
Whatcha thinkin' about?

14:27.594 --> 14:28.583
You.

14:30.034 --> 14:32.502
Stringy women like you live a long time.

14:33.554 --> 14:36.193
Sisters have seen all their husbands
put under.

14:36.994 --> 14:38.791
More than likely you will, too.

14:40.154 --> 14:41.553
And I don't wanna...

14:41.794 --> 14:43.989
...see you end up somebody's fry cook.

14:45.554 --> 14:47.943
I've been your fry cook for 40 years.

14:48.634 --> 14:50.226
A pretty good one, too.

14:51.434 --> 14:52.833
It's gettin' chilly.

14:53.074 --> 14:55.065
Come on in, have a cup o' coffee.

14:57.034 --> 14:58.183
I'll be in.

16:35.434 --> 16:36.549
Damn Anse!

16:37.434 --> 16:38.947
He put 'em up to this.

16:41.714 --> 16:44.945
I'd better jump straight down their throat
and get it over with.

16:48.994 --> 16:50.427
Don't be hard on 'em.

16:51.434 --> 16:54.665
They must've traveled half the night
to get here this early.

17:01.674 --> 17:02.789
Good morning, boys.

17:02.874 --> 17:04.910
Good morning, Mr. Andersen.

17:09.993 --> 17:12.554
LLooks like it's gonna be another fine day.

17:15.194 --> 17:16.707
What can I do for ya?

17:17.034 --> 17:20.070
Anse Petersen says you're lookin'
for hands for your drive.

17:21.034 --> 17:22.626
We come to put in for the job.

17:25.273 --> 17:28.391
Well, any of ya ever been on a cattle drive?

17:32.274 --> 17:34.151
Any of ya ever herded cattle?

17:37.114 --> 17:38.672
Well, what can you do?

17:39.354 --> 17:40.946
We can all ride.

17:42.714 --> 17:45.672
Most of us can rope.
Couple of us are pretty good shots.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.832
Well, that's somethin'.

17:50.674 --> 17:53.711
You know, trail drivin' is
no Sunday school picnic.

17:55.194 --> 17:57.469
You gotta figure you're dealin'
with the dumbest...

17:57.594 --> 18:00.552
...orneriest critter on God's green earth.

18:01.034 --> 18:04.629
A cow's nothin' but a lot of trouble
tied up in a leather bag.

18:05.554 --> 18:07.272
A horse ain't much better.

18:11.514 --> 18:13.027
Speakin' of a horse....

18:15.994 --> 18:19.464
Got me a little green broke filly over there.

18:20.554 --> 18:21.953
Name's Crazy Alice.

18:22.674 --> 18:26.303
Now if one of you was to stay aboard her,
for, say, a count of 10...

18:27.234 --> 18:30.112
...I might just keep that in mind
come hirin' time.

18:44.714 --> 18:45.829
Thank you.

19:04.114 --> 19:06.070
Steady, girl, steady.

19:32.754 --> 19:33.789
Easy.

19:44.154 --> 19:45.746
Easy. Here we are.

19:58.154 --> 19:59.348
Who's first?

20:02.634 --> 20:05.910
Well, I'll try and saddle her
while you're makin' up your mind.

20:20.434 --> 20:21.833
Made up your mind?

20:24.434 --> 20:25.708
I'll go first.

20:39.554 --> 20:42.022
I'll start countin' when you hit the saddle.

21:02.114 --> 21:03.388
Five. Six.

21:03.594 --> 21:04.788
Seven. Eight.

21:06.354 --> 21:07.469
Time!

21:08.194 --> 21:09.673
Get off of her!

21:19.554 --> 21:20.953
My name's Hunnicutt.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.583
I'm 15.

21:23.594 --> 21:25.346
And everybody calls me Slim.

21:30.434 --> 21:31.992
Easy, girl.

21:32.194 --> 21:33.183
I'm next.

21:38.314 --> 21:39.793
Easy, girl. Easy.

21:42.074 --> 21:43.985
She's rank. Keep your mind in the middle.

22:00.474 --> 22:02.465
Bail off, youngster! Bail off!

22:07.794 --> 22:09.750
My name's Homer Weems, Mr. Andersen.

22:09.834 --> 22:12.348
And I hope I ain't rode
all the rough off of her.

22:31.554 --> 22:33.545
-You all right, boy?
-Yes, sir.

22:33.954 --> 22:36.422
My name's Clyde Potter.
They call me Fats.

22:37.154 --> 22:38.746
Tendin' toward the gut myself.

22:48.554 --> 22:50.192
My name's....

22:50.714 --> 22:53.467
His name's Bob Wilson. He gets excited.

23:04.114 --> 23:06.309
I'm Charlie Schwartz. I'm Jewish.

23:07.154 --> 23:09.463
I've settled it every place in town but here.

23:10.394 --> 23:12.032
Must keep ya pretty busy.

23:12.794 --> 23:14.273
All right, who's next?

23:14.514 --> 23:15.549
I am.

23:21.634 --> 23:22.783
Good mornin'.

23:25.354 --> 23:26.582
Close the gate.

24:19.794 --> 24:21.068
Did ya see that?

24:45.234 --> 24:47.429
Here, boy. I think you can handle her now.

24:47.554 --> 24:48.828
Keep it.

24:55.714 --> 24:57.511
All right, break it up.

24:57.754 --> 24:58.982
Break it up!

25:00.474 --> 25:03.625
Come on, Slim, get back on the fence.

25:04.834 --> 25:05.949
Hurry it up.

25:08.314 --> 25:09.542
Settle down!

25:11.314 --> 25:12.508
You all right?

25:12.634 --> 25:13.589
Yes, sir.

25:15.234 --> 25:17.111
I didn't see you at the school.

25:17.634 --> 25:19.067
I don't go to school.

25:20.114 --> 25:21.183
Got a name?

25:21.634 --> 25:22.589
Cimarron.

25:22.714 --> 25:25.182
That's half a name. What's the rest of it?

25:27.554 --> 25:30.432
There's no more name.
I'm a mistake of nature.

25:41.594 --> 25:43.789
That was a pretty good ride you made.

25:46.554 --> 25:48.510
But I'll have to think you over.

26:33.114 --> 26:35.389
You having difficulty seeing the board?

26:35.714 --> 26:39.184
Homer, Bob, why don't you take
these slates and pads...

26:39.954 --> 26:42.991
...put them underneath the board
and raise it up...

26:44.114 --> 26:46.628
...so that everyone can see the lower lines.

26:51.994 --> 26:53.632
There, that's much better.

26:53.834 --> 26:54.789
Thank you, boys.

26:54.874 --> 26:58.184
When you've copied your assignments
for the week you may all go home.

27:04.474 --> 27:08.706
I'd like to talk to these boys
before class breaks up, if you don't mind.

27:10.114 --> 27:12.582
Do you wish to address
the young ladies, as well?

27:13.434 --> 27:15.186
No, I don't think so.

27:16.034 --> 27:18.184
I've nothing to say to young ladies.

27:21.114 --> 27:24.629
Then we bow to the fact
that it's a man's world and leave you to it.

27:24.714 --> 27:25.749
Girls....

27:53.674 --> 27:55.551
I don't expect to get to...

27:55.874 --> 27:58.513
...Belle Fourche with one
single head of beef...

27:59.754 --> 28:01.267
...but I'm cornered...

28:02.514 --> 28:04.106
...so I'm takin' you on.

28:05.034 --> 28:07.150
Now this is the way it's gonna be.

28:07.234 --> 28:09.429
I'm a man and you're boys.

28:10.074 --> 28:12.349
Not cowmen, not by a damned sight.

28:12.954 --> 28:16.151
Nothin' but cowboys,
just like the word says.

28:16.754 --> 28:20.588
And I'm gonna remind ya of it
every single minute of every day and night.

28:29.434 --> 28:30.992
This is the Double-O.

28:32.954 --> 28:34.546
This is Belle Fourche.

28:34.874 --> 28:39.186
In between is 400 miles
of the meanest country in the West.

28:40.434 --> 28:43.153
And the only way
we're gonna get through is if...

28:43.234 --> 28:44.633
...you take orders.

28:44.714 --> 28:45.908
Is that clear?

28:46.234 --> 28:47.349
Yes, sir.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.231
Bring a bedroll...

28:49.914 --> 28:51.393
...a couple of good ropes...

28:51.474 --> 28:53.192
...horse, if you've got one.

28:53.914 --> 28:56.428
You'll get the best food in the territory...

28:56.594 --> 28:59.188
...no rest, and damn little sleep.

29:00.234 --> 29:02.794
And 50 big silver dollars...

29:03.674 --> 29:05.665
...if we make it to Belle Fourche.

29:06.354 --> 29:08.470
Now you'll show up at my place...

29:08.674 --> 29:11.507
...first Monday after school's out,
at 5:00 a.m.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.989
And come with grit teeth.

29:15.314 --> 29:18.943
'Cause, gentlemen,
that's when school really begins.

29:20.434 --> 29:21.583
Mr. Andersen?

29:21.954 --> 29:23.023
Yeah?

29:24.034 --> 29:25.228
All of us?

29:27.554 --> 29:28.623
Come here.

29:34.554 --> 29:36.146
Anybody, that tall.

30:34.234 --> 30:38.147
They must've rode all over the territory
to get that many brand-new hats.

30:40.274 --> 30:41.548
You know...

30:41.874 --> 30:45.708
...you're gonna have to feed these kids
till my cook comes.

30:46.274 --> 30:47.468
I don't mind.

30:48.554 --> 30:50.192
I like the sound of boys.

31:24.034 --> 31:27.663
Next one of you pulls a knife in this outfit...

31:28.234 --> 31:31.271
...you're gonna learn better
at the buckle end of my belt.

31:32.274 --> 31:33.707
Now, what happened?

31:35.474 --> 31:36.543
You.

31:38.434 --> 31:39.753
What went on here?

31:40.674 --> 31:42.790
He said somethin' about his mother.

31:43.194 --> 31:44.422
What'd he say?

31:46.354 --> 31:47.833
Your mother is a whore.

31:47.914 --> 31:50.553
-You understand Spanish, Mr. Andersen?
-I understand.

31:50.634 --> 31:51.987
So does Slim.

31:54.194 --> 31:55.183
Clear out.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.505
Get on your horse and clear out.

31:59.274 --> 32:01.469
All right. There's plenty of road.

32:16.114 --> 32:17.706
Give me back my gun.

32:18.234 --> 32:21.544
I'm not in the habit of throwin'
kerosene on a fire.

32:22.154 --> 32:23.633
It cost me $30.

32:24.434 --> 32:25.753
Send me a bill.

32:26.594 --> 32:28.391
You're gonna get it, mister.

32:38.234 --> 32:40.794
All right, everybody packin' iron unload it.

32:41.314 --> 32:43.305
Throw it over here in this buggy.

32:44.274 --> 32:46.230
And I mean anything that shoots.

32:46.314 --> 32:49.545
Anybody holds out so much
as a pea-shooter...

32:49.634 --> 32:53.547
...may find himself hangin'
by a tie-rope 70 foot up in a tree.

33:00.154 --> 33:02.031
You ever fire that thing?

33:02.674 --> 33:03.663
No, sir.

33:05.394 --> 33:08.192
This hardware'll be locked up
in the chuck wagon.

33:08.714 --> 33:11.547
You got anything to settle between you,
butt heads.

33:11.754 --> 33:13.585
Now get rid of those bedrolls and...

33:13.674 --> 33:16.188
...get mounted and we'll see
how much you don't know.

33:23.034 --> 33:24.786
All right, turn him loose.

33:35.194 --> 33:36.946
Bring in the iron, Charlie.

33:43.394 --> 33:46.670
Been smellin' that for 40 years.
Never could get used to it.

33:47.034 --> 33:49.025
-You.
-Yes, sir.

33:49.114 --> 33:51.947
-What's your name?
-Hardy Fimps.

33:52.794 --> 33:54.113
Go rope one.

34:11.434 --> 34:12.583
You'll do.

34:21.434 --> 34:24.346
I've seen 'em fight all day,
from dawn to dark.

34:24.914 --> 34:27.632
Sometimes the young one wins,
sometimes the old.

34:31.074 --> 34:33.030
Young one's got more muscle.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.105
Old one's got more experience.

34:45.274 --> 34:47.583
That's the old one still standin' there.

34:49.714 --> 34:51.989
-Keep his nose out of the water.
-Watch out!

34:52.074 --> 34:54.190
Hang on to that line!

34:54.674 --> 34:56.665
Steady, steady. Pull!

34:56.754 --> 34:58.267
Slow, Weedy!

35:00.954 --> 35:02.592
Watch out for those horns.

35:03.274 --> 35:04.389
You got him.

35:05.194 --> 35:06.832
Now hold him right there.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.026
Pull his nose back now.

35:11.154 --> 35:12.633
Keep his head back.

35:19.954 --> 35:21.626
All right, take him out!

35:22.154 --> 35:23.143
Pull!

35:25.234 --> 35:26.986
Get him outta there!

35:27.474 --> 35:28.873
You need some help?

35:30.514 --> 35:32.630
Nah, they're doin' all right.

35:40.874 --> 35:42.148
Mr. Wil Andersen?

35:42.514 --> 35:43.947
What can I do for you?

35:44.074 --> 35:46.952
Well, I think there's somethin'
that we can do for each other.

35:47.074 --> 35:49.713
My name's Asa Watts. How are ya?

35:50.194 --> 35:52.662
This here's Henry Williams and Red Tucker.

35:52.994 --> 35:54.347
They both ride with me.

35:54.674 --> 35:57.632
We heard that you was goin' on a drive,
needin' some hands.

35:57.714 --> 35:59.193
You sure heard right.

35:59.274 --> 36:01.185
Well, sir, we're the very best.

36:02.154 --> 36:04.031
You fellas aren't from around here.

36:04.114 --> 36:06.230
No, sir, we're not.
We're from Denton County.

36:06.314 --> 36:09.192
We've been up
on the Ruby River pannin' for gold...

36:09.274 --> 36:11.105
...like every other damn fool.

36:11.274 --> 36:15.711
These last 22 days, you know, all we got
was $2 worth of dust and nothin' more.

36:15.794 --> 36:17.147
Ain't that pitiful?

36:17.234 --> 36:20.385
Now we're ready to get back
to what we know, and that's cows.

36:20.474 --> 36:22.226
What outfits have you worked with?

36:22.314 --> 36:26.068
Well, sir, we've worked for every big outfit
in North Montana. You name 'em.

36:26.154 --> 36:27.553
No. You name 'em.

36:28.794 --> 36:31.831
All righty.
There's Oscar West at the Triple-D...

36:32.154 --> 36:34.952
...and George C. Thompson over there
at McNeil...

36:35.114 --> 36:37.184
...Dillard Fant at the Santa Rosa.

36:37.354 --> 36:39.345
How long were you with Fant?

36:39.594 --> 36:41.505
Well, sir, the last eight years.

36:42.554 --> 36:44.385
What a lovely old gentleman he is.

36:44.474 --> 36:48.387
If we weren't three of the damnedest fools
you ever saw we'd be there with him now.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.783
And if you were, you'd be in a pine box.

36:50.994 --> 36:52.029
Sir?

36:52.394 --> 36:55.750
I was pallbearer at his funeral
five years ago.

37:00.194 --> 37:02.185
Well, I've been caught at it, haven't I?

37:03.114 --> 37:05.912
Mr. Andersen, I'm sorry. I lied to you.

37:06.874 --> 37:10.423
I got all 'em names right out of
the Stockman's Association Brand Book.

37:12.114 --> 37:14.582
We're fresh out of jail,
the three of us, and...

37:14.794 --> 37:18.548
...I don't know, you tell that to people
and they just turn a deaf ear on ya.

37:19.514 --> 37:22.153
Well, I'm afraid I can't use you.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.590
How do you mean you can't use us?

37:24.674 --> 37:26.266
I won't use you.

37:28.634 --> 37:32.422
Will you be like everybody else and not
give us a chance to redeem ourselves?

37:32.514 --> 37:35.824
I don't hold jail against you,
but I hate a liar.

37:38.754 --> 37:40.904
You're a hard man, Mr. Andersen.

37:41.634 --> 37:44.102
It's a hard life. I got work to do.

37:44.274 --> 37:48.825
Sir, before you get back to your work,
I'd like to ask you one more little question.

37:48.994 --> 37:52.066
What are you gonna use for hands
on this drive of yours, huh?

37:54.154 --> 37:56.384
Them little-bitty boys down there?

37:57.434 --> 37:58.992
Come on, you know better than that.

37:59.074 --> 38:02.225
You know what you'll need
to trundle 'em boys across the prairie?

38:02.314 --> 38:03.349
A baby carriage.

38:03.434 --> 38:05.664
Well, whatever I need I'll get.

38:05.914 --> 38:07.108
I bet you will.

38:11.554 --> 38:13.431
Good luck to you, Mr. Andersen.

38:31.594 --> 38:33.073
Get mounted!

39:22.794 --> 39:24.546
There's your saddle band.

39:24.874 --> 39:29.072
They've been livin' wild all winter.
We'll finish breaking 'em on the drive.

39:30.314 --> 39:33.033
We'll pick our strings by age.
Who's the oldest?

39:33.154 --> 39:33.950
I am.

39:34.034 --> 39:35.672
Get yourself a rope.

40:04.634 --> 40:05.669
All right.

40:08.194 --> 40:09.673
And here.

40:12.354 --> 40:13.946
May I have some more, please?

40:14.034 --> 40:14.989
Sure.

40:18.474 --> 40:20.192
You eat that much at home?

40:21.194 --> 40:24.027
We've been branding cattle all day.

40:26.554 --> 40:29.352
Can't be that hungry. They're showin' off.

40:57.634 --> 41:00.273
Good afternoon, mister.
Were you lookin' for me?

41:01.154 --> 41:02.269
Who are you?

41:02.434 --> 41:05.187
Name's Nightlinger. Jebediah Nightlinger.

41:06.434 --> 41:08.265
I was expecting a white man.

41:08.794 --> 41:10.705
Jim Wheeler. What happened to him?

41:10.794 --> 41:13.786
Well, he got drunk on Sunday
and married on Monday.

41:14.154 --> 41:15.587
I came in his stead.

41:15.994 --> 41:19.031
I told him the fix I was in.
He promised he wouldn't let me down.

41:19.114 --> 41:22.311
He doesn't even wash his hands
before he puts 'em in the pot.

41:22.514 --> 41:23.503
I do.

41:24.394 --> 41:25.622
Can you cook?

41:27.274 --> 41:28.502
Apple pie.

41:28.834 --> 41:30.426
Green apples sliced thin.

41:30.874 --> 41:33.946
LLard, flour, salt, water to bind.

41:34.394 --> 41:36.954
Sugar, cinnamon, a dab of butter.

41:37.394 --> 41:40.192
Three slashes on the crust, one for steam...

41:40.274 --> 41:42.663
...and two because your momma
did it that way.

41:43.074 --> 41:45.463
Good afternoon to you, lady. Am I correct?

41:45.714 --> 41:46.988
Why, yes, indeed.

41:47.074 --> 41:48.063
Mrs. Andersen.

41:48.154 --> 41:49.143
Ma'am.

41:49.794 --> 41:51.864
You ever been on a trail drive?

41:52.314 --> 41:54.111
The Oregon, Chisholm...

41:54.594 --> 41:56.824
...Santa Fe, some without names.

41:56.994 --> 41:58.222
I don't know.

41:58.634 --> 42:00.989
I like to travel with a man I'm used to.

42:01.714 --> 42:03.227
You'll get used to me.

42:05.954 --> 42:07.273
What do you want for wages?

42:07.354 --> 42:08.673
All I can get.

42:09.794 --> 42:11.307
This job pays $100.

42:11.434 --> 42:12.469
A hundred?

42:13.474 --> 42:14.463
That's the money.

42:14.554 --> 42:18.183
Well, if you should get flooded out,
stampeded out, frozen out...

42:18.434 --> 42:20.425
...or scalped by wild red Indians...

42:20.514 --> 42:24.632
...there'll always be substantial food
on the plate and coffee on the boil. But...

42:24.714 --> 42:26.750
...that'll cost you $125.

42:27.514 --> 42:30.108
You're a pretty independent character,
aren't ya?

42:30.834 --> 42:32.313
It's been said of me.

42:35.994 --> 42:37.712
Put your wagon in the barn.

42:39.434 --> 42:41.106
Are all these small boys...?

42:41.194 --> 42:45.267
No! They're my trail hands, God help us.

42:46.914 --> 42:49.553
Well, doesn't anything larger
wanna work for you?

42:50.114 --> 42:52.787
We had a case o' gold fever around here.

42:53.074 --> 42:54.666
They're all that's left.

42:56.474 --> 42:58.942
I'll fix up some sugar tits to take along.

43:00.034 --> 43:02.502
Hey, Dan. What's sugar tits?

43:38.994 --> 43:40.313
This one suits me.

44:33.674 --> 44:35.665
Smells of boy in here.

44:39.314 --> 44:41.270
You're staring at me, children!

44:41.554 --> 44:43.272
I feel your eyes on my back.

44:44.074 --> 44:45.348
Now why is that?

44:46.114 --> 44:47.388
Well, sir...

44:47.914 --> 44:50.189
...you're the first nigger we ever saw.

44:50.914 --> 44:52.870
Then it must be a treat for you.

44:53.594 --> 44:55.425
Something different for a change.

44:57.154 --> 44:58.746
Are you black all over?

44:59.994 --> 45:01.950
Except for the white o' my eyes.

45:02.474 --> 45:05.193
Is your, you know, your--

45:06.114 --> 45:08.184
It is. Black, too.

45:08.954 --> 45:11.866
See? He's the same as us,
except for that color.

45:13.274 --> 45:14.548
The same as you?

45:19.074 --> 45:20.632
The same as you!

45:24.474 --> 45:26.112
Oh, children.

45:27.314 --> 45:29.544
My father was a brawny Moor.

45:30.154 --> 45:31.985
Six feet six inches tall.

45:33.394 --> 45:36.989
He bound his head in a red velvet cloth.

45:38.954 --> 45:40.910
He wore a curved sword...

45:41.514 --> 45:43.823
...forged from the finest Toledo steel.

45:44.834 --> 45:47.109
He captured a lady...

45:47.794 --> 45:49.625
...bright and dark.

45:50.634 --> 45:52.511
He took her in his arms...

45:53.234 --> 45:55.384
...and wrapped her in a warm quilt...

45:56.034 --> 45:57.592
...and carried her off.

45:59.514 --> 46:01.425
They came to a castle...

46:02.834 --> 46:06.224
...and he battered down the doors
with the trunk of an oak tree...

46:06.434 --> 46:08.789
...and killed everybody in it!

46:09.954 --> 46:12.309
Just so they could rest the night.

46:18.354 --> 46:19.423
LLater...

46:20.874 --> 46:22.432
...while she slept...

46:23.954 --> 46:25.910
...he walked the parapets...

46:28.634 --> 46:30.113
...and became a king.

46:33.074 --> 46:34.553
Is that true?

46:35.594 --> 46:38.062
If it isn't, it ought to be.

46:40.114 --> 46:41.547
Blow out those lamps!

46:41.634 --> 46:43.511
You, that lamp!

47:12.554 --> 47:13.703
Do your work.

47:13.834 --> 47:16.189
Don't be profane
and don't listen to profanity.

47:17.354 --> 47:19.390
Wash your feet daily.
Say your prayers nightly.

47:19.514 --> 47:20.503
Yes, sir.

47:20.994 --> 47:23.462
You have to go out in the world
and prove yourself.

47:24.834 --> 47:26.267
I guess that's right.

47:33.074 --> 47:34.427
God bless you, son.

47:37.954 --> 47:39.910
-Don't be fresh.
-I won't.

47:40.074 --> 47:41.507
And don't come to any harm.

47:41.634 --> 47:43.192
Don't worry, I won't.

47:49.714 --> 47:51.113
So long, Gramps.

48:04.554 --> 48:06.385
Sixty days oughta see me back.

48:08.154 --> 48:09.633
I want two things.

48:10.314 --> 48:11.303
What?

48:13.194 --> 48:16.391
You home again
and a string of blue glass beads.

48:17.594 --> 48:19.346
You don't ask for much, Ann.

48:19.434 --> 48:20.787
I don't need much.

48:21.714 --> 48:24.387
Well, if ya run into any trouble, call Anse.

48:26.674 --> 48:29.188
I'll think about ya
before I go to bed at night.

48:30.834 --> 48:32.745
You do and you won't sleep.

49:17.034 --> 49:20.151
-Are you ready, Mr. Nightlinger?
-LLong ready, Mr. Andersen.

49:20.234 --> 49:21.826
LLet's go to Belle Fourche.

49:24.874 --> 49:26.227
Move 'em out!

49:26.434 --> 49:28.994
Yes, sir! Move 'em out, Weedy!

49:29.594 --> 49:30.993
Start 'em, Charlie!

49:31.274 --> 49:32.627
Move 'em out, Bob!

49:32.914 --> 49:34.666
Move 'em, Jim!

50:16.154 --> 50:18.190
All right, don't move 'em over here.

50:18.314 --> 50:19.906
Keep 'em over this way!

50:46.554 --> 50:47.873
That's good, Slim.

50:49.954 --> 50:51.387
Right pace, Homer.

50:52.234 --> 50:54.623
Any faster you'd be runnin' tallow
off of 'em.

50:54.714 --> 50:56.591
That's money out of my pocket.

51:04.554 --> 51:06.749
We'll try and make Still Meadows tonight.

51:06.834 --> 51:08.028
Still Meadows.

51:28.034 --> 51:30.912
All right, take 'em through.
Take 'em through. Come on!

51:32.554 --> 51:34.624
Get with it! Head 'em down there!

51:34.834 --> 51:36.392
Head 'em downhill!

51:36.754 --> 51:39.029
Get up there, kid. Get up where you were!

51:42.714 --> 51:44.193
Get down, Hardy!

51:44.794 --> 51:47.308
Hey, there's a stray.
You want me to get him?

51:48.514 --> 51:51.392
Easy, easy! Don't stop, go with 'em!

51:51.874 --> 51:52.989
Go with 'em!

51:55.154 --> 51:56.746
Go on with the wagon!

51:57.754 --> 52:00.348
Easy, easy. Don't stop 'em.

52:00.794 --> 52:02.432
Go with 'em! Go with 'em!

52:21.834 --> 52:23.187
You were sleepin'.

52:25.114 --> 52:26.706
I'm sorry, Mr. Andersen.

52:27.114 --> 52:30.993
I pay a full day's wages,
and expect a full day's work.

53:02.354 --> 53:04.663
Drove you hard today, didn't he, children?

53:16.394 --> 53:19.431
-You think it's gonna be like this everyday?
-Yep.

53:20.154 --> 53:21.382
Sundays, too?

53:21.474 --> 53:23.704
There ain't no Sundays west of Omaha.

53:24.754 --> 53:26.824
Slim, give that to Hardy.

53:28.874 --> 53:30.307
Watch it, it's hot.

53:33.434 --> 53:35.072
I never noticed before...

53:35.914 --> 53:39.748
...but most of the people I know
are quiet compared to Mr. Andersen.

53:40.394 --> 53:43.272
He's quiet, it just comes out loud.

54:19.034 --> 54:21.025
That youngster's been following all day.

54:21.114 --> 54:22.103
I know it.

54:22.954 --> 54:23.989
Who is he?

54:25.874 --> 54:27.466
A burr under my hide.

54:27.594 --> 54:29.789
You just gonna leave him out there?

54:30.474 --> 54:34.467
Mr. Nightlinger, you take care
of the kitchen, I'll take care of the drive.

54:40.674 --> 54:44.030
You know, in the late war
between the states...

54:44.754 --> 54:46.824
...I served under an officer...

54:47.314 --> 54:49.066
...just like you.

54:50.834 --> 54:52.108
Is that right?

54:52.554 --> 54:56.263
As a matter of fact, I shot
that military gentleman in the buttocks...

54:56.514 --> 54:58.311
...just outside of Vicksburg.

54:58.954 --> 55:00.387
I'd have hung ya.

55:01.274 --> 55:03.151
They gave me a medal.

55:05.314 --> 55:07.589
In my regiment, Mr. Nightlinger...

55:08.554 --> 55:10.590
...I was known as Old Iron Pants.

55:11.274 --> 55:12.992
You might keep that in mind.

55:22.514 --> 55:25.506
Rise and shine! Rise and shine!

55:25.874 --> 55:27.785
Hey, Hardy, you wake up!

55:28.314 --> 55:31.351
Homer! Get up and go wake up
good Slim over there!

55:31.834 --> 55:33.062
Up, up, up!

55:33.354 --> 55:35.709
Out of these sacks, into your britches!

55:35.794 --> 55:37.830
Come on, Jim, get up! Get up!

55:38.474 --> 55:40.385
My God, get up!

55:40.554 --> 55:42.306
Don't let the sun catch ya sleepin'.

55:42.394 --> 55:44.430
Mr. Nightlinger, what's for breakfast?

55:44.514 --> 55:46.470
Stewed apples, bacon and biscuits.

55:46.554 --> 55:48.033
Well, forget the apples.

55:48.114 --> 55:50.628
Slap some bacon on a biscuit and let's go!

55:50.754 --> 55:52.312
We're burnin' daylight!

55:52.714 --> 55:54.352
Burnin' daylight?

55:55.074 --> 55:56.302
All I see are stars.

55:56.394 --> 55:58.703
You'll see a lot more of 'em
if you don't move it.

56:04.554 --> 56:05.703
Bring 'em on!

56:07.234 --> 56:09.543
Bring 'em on, Mr. Nightlinger!

56:23.714 --> 56:26.626
Go on. Stay with 'em. Keep 'em upriver.

56:27.874 --> 56:31.264
Stay upriver, Mr. Nightlinger,
there's some soft sand down there.

56:32.554 --> 56:35.751
Keep 'em upriver,
and let 'em go higher up their heads.

56:47.714 --> 56:49.113
Well, come on.

57:04.794 --> 57:07.547
Keep 'em upstream
so they won't have to swim.

57:18.954 --> 57:20.626
Push 'em upstream, that's it.

57:20.714 --> 57:21.749
Good work.

57:26.554 --> 57:28.351
Head 'em upstream more.

57:36.434 --> 57:39.312
Hold 'em up in the canyon
till they all get across.

57:56.394 --> 57:57.747
Help! Help!

58:21.834 --> 58:22.789
Come on.

58:23.314 --> 58:24.986
Here's one of your strays.

58:26.474 --> 58:27.623
You all right?

58:29.474 --> 58:32.864
Better sit on his back and pump him out.

58:34.474 --> 58:35.429
Get his feet up.

58:36.154 --> 58:37.826
Move your gear into camp.

58:39.354 --> 58:42.073
I won't charge you for the days
I've been following you.

58:42.154 --> 58:44.668
You're hired on, just like the rest.

58:44.834 --> 58:46.233
You work out, you stay.

58:46.314 --> 58:48.589
If you don't, it's a long walk back.

58:50.634 --> 58:51.749
You!

58:58.354 --> 59:00.584
You almost got him killed, you know that?

59:00.674 --> 59:03.268
-But I tried to tell you.
-The hell you did!

59:03.594 --> 59:04.709
I tried hard.

59:04.794 --> 59:07.672
If you'd have been out in that water
we'd have heard you.

59:07.754 --> 59:09.551
I couldn't get the words out.

59:09.634 --> 59:12.990
You could've if you'd wanted to.
You just didn't want to bad enough.

59:13.074 --> 59:14.666
Before God, I tried.

59:14.754 --> 59:16.392
Tryin' don't get it done!

59:16.474 --> 59:20.228
The fact is, you almost let your friend
choke to death out in that river.

59:20.314 --> 59:23.112
-I'd rather die than done that.
-Then you're a liar!

59:24.114 --> 59:25.911
It ain't my fault I stutter.

59:25.994 --> 59:28.224
LListen to me, you whinin' little whelp...

59:28.314 --> 59:30.874
...you'll stop stutterin'
or get the hell out of here.

59:30.954 --> 59:33.229
You're gonna stop it or go home,
do you hear me?

59:34.634 --> 59:35.987
You son of a bitch.

59:36.714 --> 59:37.829
What did you say?

59:37.914 --> 59:40.792
-You goddamn son of a bitch!
-Say that again.

59:41.034 --> 59:43.468
-You goddamn, mean son of a bitch!
-Say it faster!

59:43.554 --> 59:46.227
You goddamn, mean, dirty son of a bitch!

59:47.754 --> 59:50.587
I wouldn't make it a habit
callin' me that, son.

59:55.114 --> 59:56.388
I did it.

59:57.354 --> 59:58.787
Did ya hear me?

59:59.034 --> 01:00:00.103
I did it.

01:00:01.194 --> 01:00:02.343
I did it.

01:00:18.794 --> 01:00:20.022
Hey, Cimarron.

01:00:25.394 --> 01:00:27.749
I ain't had a chance to thank you
for haulin' me out.

01:00:27.834 --> 01:00:29.108
I sure am obliged.

01:00:30.474 --> 01:00:32.908
-Well, I figure I owe you for it.
-Yeah?

01:00:33.794 --> 01:00:35.193
How much in dollars?

01:00:36.354 --> 01:00:39.630
Well, I can't pay you in dollars.
I ain't got any dollars.

01:00:39.754 --> 01:00:41.870
Well, money's what cuts it with me.

01:00:44.034 --> 01:00:45.433
Hey, wait a minute.

01:00:55.394 --> 01:00:57.066
I picked this up on the trail.

01:00:57.514 --> 01:01:01.143
I know it ain't gold, it's just fool's gold,
but it's kinda pretty.

01:01:02.954 --> 01:01:04.467
You callin' me a fool?

01:01:04.634 --> 01:01:06.864
No, no, I didn't mean it like that.

01:01:18.674 --> 01:01:20.107
I got no use for it.

01:01:32.514 --> 01:01:34.232
You write that yourself?

01:01:34.434 --> 01:01:37.744
No, no. It's printed on paper.
I've been tryin' to learn it.

01:01:39.634 --> 01:01:42.353
Well, there's nothin' to it.
It's just like arithmetic.

01:01:42.434 --> 01:01:43.662
All you gotta do is just...

01:01:43.754 --> 01:01:46.712
...count lines and spaces.
That tells you where the notes go.

01:01:46.794 --> 01:01:48.227
It ain't hard.

01:01:50.434 --> 01:01:52.186
LLooks like fly specks to me.

01:01:53.114 --> 01:01:55.105
Some guy named Vivaldi wrote it.

01:01:57.274 --> 01:01:58.593
It's kinda pretty.

01:02:09.834 --> 01:02:13.110
If that's that ol' Tennessee sour mash,
put a little in there.

01:02:14.994 --> 01:02:16.871
Good for my rheumatism.

01:02:17.194 --> 01:02:18.786
That comes with old age.

01:02:18.914 --> 01:02:21.109
Yeah, miserable old age.

01:02:21.314 --> 01:02:22.542
I hate it.

01:02:23.154 --> 01:02:25.793
I'm not far behind you
and I don't like it, either.

01:02:28.994 --> 01:02:30.586
My oldest boy...

01:02:32.634 --> 01:02:35.273
...would be close to 40 now. Middle-aged.

01:02:36.154 --> 01:02:37.667
If he had lived.

01:02:37.794 --> 01:02:39.227
You lost a son?

01:02:40.154 --> 01:02:41.223
Two of 'em.

01:02:42.514 --> 01:02:43.913
Went bad on me.

01:02:46.034 --> 01:02:47.831
Or I went bad on them.

01:02:48.274 --> 01:02:49.468
I don't know.

01:02:49.834 --> 01:02:51.472
I can't figure it out.

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:53.786
You got another chance.

01:02:56.074 --> 01:02:57.427
They're not mine.

01:02:58.634 --> 01:02:59.862
They could be.

01:04:01.314 --> 01:04:04.226
So as I went down to Denver
with my cousin, LL.D. Grimes...

01:04:04.314 --> 01:04:06.782
...then there was
a hootchy-kootchy show goin' on.

01:04:06.874 --> 01:04:09.547
When the fella wasn't lookin'
we snuck in under the tent.

01:04:09.634 --> 01:04:12.626
There was this gal up on the stage
doin' a harem dance.

01:04:13.634 --> 01:04:16.307
First thing I know,
she dropped her dress and was naked.

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:18.589
-All over?
-From head to toe.

01:04:18.994 --> 01:04:20.473
What'd she look like?

01:04:20.714 --> 01:04:24.423
She had a belly button so big,
you could've stuck your middle finger in it.

01:04:24.514 --> 01:04:27.984
I saw my first one in Benbow, too.
Fifty years ago.

01:04:28.914 --> 01:04:30.472
Probably the same girl.

01:04:33.594 --> 01:04:35.664
Damned if he ain't almost human today.

01:04:36.194 --> 01:04:38.992
He's been sleepin' better.
He's been at the bottle.

01:04:39.194 --> 01:04:40.752
You mean there's bug juice in camp?

01:04:40.834 --> 01:04:44.190
I seen him and Mr. Nightlinger
swillin' it down last night.

01:04:44.314 --> 01:04:46.350
Keeps it in a drawer in the chuck wagon.

01:04:46.434 --> 01:04:47.833
Which drawer?

01:05:04.994 --> 01:05:06.666
Come on. Hurry up. Give me that.

01:05:08.554 --> 01:05:10.863
Come on, let's go. Hurry up.

01:05:15.194 --> 01:05:16.024
Come on, Weedy.

01:05:16.114 --> 01:05:17.752
Weedy, come on.

01:05:18.354 --> 01:05:19.753
Hurry up. Everybody else is.

01:05:19.954 --> 01:05:22.149
-You're wasting time.
-Gambling's a sin.

01:05:22.234 --> 01:05:24.589
-So what?
-This ain't gamblin', it's stealin'.

01:05:24.714 --> 01:05:26.944
-That's a bigger sin.
-Not if you don't get caught.

01:05:27.034 --> 01:05:29.753
-Come on, just take one.
-Come on, Weedy, come on.

01:05:33.354 --> 01:05:35.026
Holy shit!

01:05:35.714 --> 01:05:37.705
Go on, Weedy, go on. Hurry up.

01:05:37.914 --> 01:05:39.586
Watch out! Here he comes.

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:54.112
Innocence is wasted on me.
I don't believe in it.

01:05:54.514 --> 01:05:55.867
What are you up to?

01:05:57.354 --> 01:05:58.992
Nothin', Mr. Nightlinger.

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:01.142
Nothin' at all.

01:06:02.034 --> 01:06:04.707
Boys are always guilty of something nasty.

01:06:05.874 --> 01:06:08.069
What could it be this time, I wonder?

01:06:08.514 --> 01:06:11.551
Nothin', I swear. Just standin' here talkin'.

01:06:11.914 --> 01:06:14.382
If you're lying, remember one thing:

01:06:15.434 --> 01:06:18.267
I could swallow each of you whole,
without choking.

01:06:19.314 --> 01:06:22.624
All I need to do is butter your heads
and pin your ears back.

01:06:34.794 --> 01:06:36.273
Hey, come on.

01:06:40.634 --> 01:06:41.703
Hurry up.

01:06:41.794 --> 01:06:43.352
Get goin'. Go, go.

01:06:44.034 --> 01:06:45.752
Keep goin'.

01:06:48.514 --> 01:06:51.392
LLook in with the liniment.
That's where my folks keep it.

01:06:54.194 --> 01:06:55.673
-Hurry up.
-Come on.

01:06:56.794 --> 01:06:59.149
Come on, Weedy,
don't take your sweet time.

01:06:59.234 --> 01:07:01.190
-Come on. Come on.
-Hurry up.

01:07:01.274 --> 01:07:02.946
Hurry up, Weedy.

01:07:03.474 --> 01:07:05.112
-Come on.
-It's not here.

01:07:05.194 --> 01:07:07.025
-LLook around here.
-LLook over here.

01:07:08.354 --> 01:07:09.582
Hurry up.

01:07:09.914 --> 01:07:12.428
-Would you get goin'? We'll watch.
-Go on.

01:07:17.474 --> 01:07:18.589
I got it.

01:07:20.234 --> 01:07:22.350
Don't drop it.

01:07:28.114 --> 01:07:30.150
-Hot coffee.
-Heard ya comin'.

01:07:30.354 --> 01:07:31.423
I'm used.

01:07:38.194 --> 01:07:39.468
That Fats!

01:07:40.754 --> 01:07:43.109
He can sure sing those cows to sleep.

01:07:46.394 --> 01:07:48.908
Fat boy isn't on guard. He was just here.

01:07:49.514 --> 01:07:51.027
That's right. It's...

01:07:52.074 --> 01:07:53.587
...Steve and Cimarron.

01:07:56.634 --> 01:07:58.386
There's more than one voice.

01:08:17.154 --> 01:08:18.428
What is this?

01:08:52.953 --> 01:08:55.514
Weedy! You keep takin'
long swigs like that...

01:08:55.594 --> 01:08:57.663
...you're gonna miss your turn next time.

01:08:57.754 --> 01:08:58.823
Pass it on.

01:09:00.234 --> 01:09:02.667
Hey! There's two of everybody.

01:09:07.514 --> 01:09:09.072
There's two moons.

01:09:10.314 --> 01:09:12.828
I'm going to bed as soon as I can stand up.

01:09:13.674 --> 01:09:15.665
Just don't wake up Ol' Iron Nuts.

01:09:17.674 --> 01:09:21.633
Mr. Brass Ass Andersen.
A bastard if there ever was one.

01:09:22.113 --> 01:09:25.185
He made you stop stutterin' fast.
He really tromped your tail!

01:09:25.274 --> 01:09:26.263
LListen, Fatso....

01:09:26.354 --> 01:09:29.027
I could have given up stutterin'
a long time ago.

01:09:29.234 --> 01:09:31.987
-Why didn't ya?
-I didn't know anybody wanted me to.

01:09:35.314 --> 01:09:37.828
This is the first time I've ever been drunk.

01:09:39.113 --> 01:09:41.582
Oh, you gettin' sick, ya farmer?

01:09:44.194 --> 01:09:45.866
-I've decided.
-What?

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:50.911
I've decided if Ol' Iron Nuts tells me
I'm burnin' daylight just one more time...

01:09:51.033 --> 01:09:52.786
...I'm gonna let him have it.

01:09:53.874 --> 01:09:55.193
Have what?

01:09:56.074 --> 01:09:57.029
It.

01:09:57.314 --> 01:09:58.872
What's it?

01:10:01.874 --> 01:10:03.273
I ain't decided yet.

01:10:04.434 --> 01:10:05.947
What happened to that bottle?

01:10:06.074 --> 01:10:07.427
It's coming.

01:10:09.274 --> 01:10:12.744
You know who you sounded like just then?
Mr. Nightlinger.

01:10:13.994 --> 01:10:17.225
That black son of a bitch
cooks better than my ma.

01:10:17.514 --> 01:10:21.302
Come on, you, we oughta be goin'
before the old man finds out we're gone.

01:10:23.994 --> 01:10:25.393
Yeah, come on.

01:10:26.234 --> 01:10:29.226
Did ya ever notice how pink
Mr. Nightlinger's palms are?

01:10:29.474 --> 01:10:30.953
They're kinda pretty.

01:10:32.034 --> 01:10:33.183
Shit.

01:10:33.674 --> 01:10:34.902
Shit yourself.

01:10:45.154 --> 01:10:47.270
Shall we join 'em, Mr. Nightlinger?

01:10:55.834 --> 01:10:57.984
When did you take your first drink?

01:11:00.314 --> 01:11:03.067
It was on the occasion
of my first broken heart.

01:11:03.754 --> 01:11:04.948
And my last.

01:11:06.474 --> 01:11:08.942
She was an older woman and wise.

01:11:09.514 --> 01:11:10.993
Vastly experienced.

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:15.710
She told me she couldn't stand
the sight of me for another minute...

01:11:15.794 --> 01:11:18.672
...handed me a half-gallon jug
of sour mash and fled.

01:11:19.114 --> 01:11:20.672
And you polished it off?

01:11:20.914 --> 01:11:21.983
Every drop.

01:11:23.274 --> 01:11:25.504
I've been drinking sour mash ever since.

01:11:27.194 --> 01:11:28.547
I was 17.

01:11:30.274 --> 01:11:31.946
She was almost 22.

01:11:33.074 --> 01:11:34.223
Her name...

01:11:35.834 --> 01:11:37.187
...was Oceola.

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:41.583
I think these kids are rushin' it a little.

01:11:41.994 --> 01:11:43.825
They're in a hurry to grow up.

01:11:45.074 --> 01:11:47.030
Well, they won't get it out of a bottle.

01:11:47.114 --> 01:11:48.866
They'll know that in the morning.

01:11:58.194 --> 01:12:00.071
All down sick at once.

01:12:01.554 --> 01:12:03.465
Must've passed a bad waterhole.

01:12:04.514 --> 01:12:06.152
Well, this'll settle you.

01:12:06.874 --> 01:12:08.023
Come on, son.

01:12:08.354 --> 01:12:09.867
Back, wide.

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:12.183
Voila.

01:12:13.354 --> 01:12:14.946
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:12:15.594 --> 01:12:18.950
Mr. Nightlinger, I'd like some beans
and cabbage for supper...

01:12:19.074 --> 01:12:22.305
...with a big chunk of fatback
in some red pepper sauce.

01:12:22.954 --> 01:12:25.388
And make some gravy out of the grease.

01:12:25.594 --> 01:12:26.868
I'll be back.

01:12:28.674 --> 01:12:30.824
Hurry it up. We're burnin' daylight.

01:12:31.114 --> 01:12:32.991
All right, son, tongue out.

01:12:33.394 --> 01:12:34.509
Head back.

01:12:35.314 --> 01:12:36.303
Wider.

01:12:42.434 --> 01:12:44.425
Where do you think you're goin'?

01:12:44.514 --> 01:12:45.833
Go get him, Dan.

01:12:46.754 --> 01:12:48.506
Come back, you.

01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:22.709
You ain't nothin' but a small child.

01:13:23.194 --> 01:13:25.583
If you was a fish, I'd throw you back.

01:13:25.794 --> 01:13:27.671
Hey, boys! LLook here!

01:13:29.194 --> 01:13:30.513
LLook what I found.

01:13:31.714 --> 01:13:33.545
LLook around and meet the boys.

01:13:34.194 --> 01:13:35.991
It looks like he surprised us.

01:13:36.074 --> 01:13:38.429
We surprised you, too, though,
didn't we, boy?

01:13:38.514 --> 01:13:40.982
You know better than to scream out now,
don't ya?

01:13:42.954 --> 01:13:44.910
What's the matter with you, son?

01:13:45.474 --> 01:13:47.942
You're lookin' at me like I had two heads.

01:13:51.554 --> 01:13:54.068
You're wonderin' where I came from,
ain't ya?

01:13:57.034 --> 01:13:59.423
You know we've been trackin' ya for days?

01:14:00.434 --> 01:14:02.425
What have you got to say to that?

01:14:02.954 --> 01:14:04.069
I can't hear you, son.

01:14:04.154 --> 01:14:05.667
I can't hear you, son!

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:07.307
I won't say nothin'.

01:14:09.514 --> 01:14:10.993
You're a quiet boy.

01:14:11.954 --> 01:14:14.343
If I had a prize I'd give it to you, boy.

01:14:15.474 --> 01:14:16.907
I like quiet boys.

01:14:17.914 --> 01:14:19.472
Now, quiet boy...

01:14:19.794 --> 01:14:21.591
...I'm gonna let you loose.

01:14:22.834 --> 01:14:24.870
But, you point your ears now, son.

01:14:26.514 --> 01:14:30.268
You won't run back to Mr. Andersen
with them eyes rollin' back in your head...

01:14:30.354 --> 01:14:33.790
...tellin' him that these bad men
have been followin' us day and night.

01:14:33.874 --> 01:14:35.068
You're not gonna say that.

01:14:35.154 --> 01:14:38.112
You think you'll raise a commotion
and get congratulated for it.

01:14:38.194 --> 01:14:41.311
They'll pat your head
and tell you what a good boy you've been.

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:43.510
That's not gonna do you any good, son.

01:14:44.234 --> 01:14:45.587
You know why?

01:14:46.034 --> 01:14:48.468
Now you listen to me careful, boy.
You know why?

01:14:49.074 --> 01:14:52.146
Because I'm gonna come to you
some night when it's real dark.

01:14:52.434 --> 01:14:54.994
I'm gonna come to you on tiptoe...

01:14:56.034 --> 01:14:58.673
...so you ain't never gonna be able
to hear me.

01:14:59.314 --> 01:15:01.828
And I'm gonna come to you with a knife...

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:04.109
...freshly sharpened on a stone...

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:09.224
...and I'm gonna cut you a grin
down here on your neck.

01:15:09.314 --> 01:15:12.386
It's gonna run clear across to there.

01:15:15.434 --> 01:15:17.709
Do I make myself clear, boy?

01:15:17.914 --> 01:15:20.223
Do I make myself clear, boy?

01:15:29.154 --> 01:15:30.951
Is it clear to ya now? Huh?

01:15:33.514 --> 01:15:35.027
Is it clear to ya?

01:15:37.554 --> 01:15:39.431
-Is it clear?
-Yes, it's clear.

01:15:46.114 --> 01:15:47.149
Go home!

01:18:29.288 --> 01:18:31.040
No. No, I ain't gonna.

01:18:31.128 --> 01:18:33.323
-You gotta stand watch.
-I ain't gonna.

01:18:33.448 --> 01:18:35.359
-It's your turn.
-I ain't gonna.

01:18:35.488 --> 01:18:36.523
Why not?

01:18:37.208 --> 01:18:38.527
I ain't gonna.

01:18:44.928 --> 01:18:48.045
-What's the matter, Dan?
-Nothin'. Just, just leave me alone.

01:18:48.648 --> 01:18:50.684
Mr. Andersen, can I speak to you?

01:18:52.048 --> 01:18:53.083
Go ahead.

01:18:53.728 --> 01:18:55.480
Well, it's about Dan.

01:18:55.968 --> 01:18:57.196
What about him?

01:18:59.008 --> 01:19:01.078
He doesn't want to stand his watch.

01:19:01.648 --> 01:19:03.684
-Is he sick?
-No, sir.

01:19:03.928 --> 01:19:05.805
Well, did he break something?

01:19:05.968 --> 01:19:07.083
No, sir.

01:19:07.528 --> 01:19:09.405
To tell you the truth...

01:19:09.488 --> 01:19:11.604
...I think he's afraid of the dark.

01:19:23.408 --> 01:19:24.523
Come here.

01:19:31.448 --> 01:19:32.801
What ails you, boy?

01:19:34.528 --> 01:19:35.517
Nothin'.

01:19:36.288 --> 01:19:38.597
-You nighthawked last night.
-Yes, sir.

01:19:38.768 --> 01:19:40.884
-Everything went smooth.
-Yes, sir.

01:19:41.528 --> 01:19:44.804
If you don't stand your watch,
somebody goes short of sleep.

01:19:45.248 --> 01:19:46.920
Carry your weight, boy.

01:19:50.568 --> 01:19:51.603
Yes, sir.

01:20:21.968 --> 01:20:25.119
I don't steal off you and you don't off me,
not even a pinch of pie.

01:20:25.208 --> 01:20:26.687
What the matter with you?

01:20:26.768 --> 01:20:29.566
Your house is your house
and my house is my house.

01:20:29.648 --> 01:20:32.958
Mr. Nightlinger, you'd better start
bein' real careful.

01:20:33.088 --> 01:20:35.158
How does it feel to be scared?

01:20:39.368 --> 01:20:41.928
You think I was too rough on the boy,
is that it?

01:20:42.048 --> 01:20:43.686
Yeah, that's it.

01:20:51.208 --> 01:20:54.598
Well, I can't say I always decide right.

01:20:55.208 --> 01:20:56.561
In that case...

01:20:58.368 --> 01:21:00.279
...cut yourself a piece of pie.

01:21:13.248 --> 01:21:15.364
Move easy. They're kinda jumpy.

01:22:09.288 --> 01:22:11.643
They look funny from up here, don't they?

01:22:16.648 --> 01:22:18.127
My glasses!

01:22:21.448 --> 01:22:22.881
I'll get 'em for ya.

01:22:23.568 --> 01:22:26.526
-Be careful, Charlie.
-Don't worry, I'll be all right.

01:22:29.648 --> 01:22:31.400
Come on, come on.

01:22:33.768 --> 01:22:35.042
Easy, boy.

01:22:36.648 --> 01:22:38.161
Easy, easy.

01:22:40.608 --> 01:22:42.041
Come on, boy, come on.

01:22:42.128 --> 01:22:43.527
Come on, easy.

01:22:43.688 --> 01:22:45.599
Easy, boy. Easy, boy.

01:22:45.848 --> 01:22:47.406
Come on, easy.

01:22:49.528 --> 01:22:51.086
Be real careful, Charlie.

01:22:51.168 --> 01:22:52.442
Don't worry.

01:22:54.568 --> 01:22:55.557
Get off him easy.

01:22:55.648 --> 01:22:57.001
Just stop worryin'.

01:23:05.528 --> 01:23:06.927
I found 'em!

01:23:07.088 --> 01:23:09.283
Come on up. Hurry out of there.

01:23:20.968 --> 01:23:23.277
Easy, Charlie, don't spook 'em.

01:23:27.528 --> 01:23:29.041
They're crowdin' me!

01:23:36.048 --> 01:23:37.606
Charlie!

01:23:58.648 --> 01:24:00.047
Sometimes, it's...

01:24:01.648 --> 01:24:03.240
...hard to understand...

01:24:04.728 --> 01:24:06.286
...the drift of things.

01:24:07.688 --> 01:24:09.406
This was a good boy.

01:24:10.808 --> 01:24:12.480
He'd have been a good man.

01:24:13.288 --> 01:24:14.846
Didn't get his chance.

01:24:17.528 --> 01:24:20.326
Death can come for you anyplace...

01:24:21.528 --> 01:24:22.756
...anytime.

01:24:24.128 --> 01:24:25.766
It's never welcome, but...

01:24:27.208 --> 01:24:29.278
...if you've done all you can do...

01:24:30.608 --> 01:24:32.246
...and it's your best...

01:24:34.688 --> 01:24:37.407
...in a way, I guess, you're ready for him.

01:24:43.288 --> 01:24:44.687
Go on back to camp.

01:24:45.728 --> 01:24:46.877
All of you.

01:25:15.288 --> 01:25:16.437
Go on, son.

01:26:19.328 --> 01:26:20.477
What's that?

01:26:22.328 --> 01:26:23.761
LLittle Big Horn.

01:26:25.568 --> 01:26:27.843
They didn't even dig him a decent grave.

01:26:28.328 --> 01:26:30.523
Well, it's not how you're buried...

01:26:31.328 --> 01:26:33.205
...it's how they remember ya.

01:26:33.728 --> 01:26:36.322
I guess I better go into Fort Smith and...

01:26:36.808 --> 01:26:39.527
...see if there's been any Sioux activity
up ahead.

01:26:41.288 --> 01:26:44.678
Keep the cattle headed due east.
Tell Mr. Nightlinger he's in charge.

01:26:44.768 --> 01:26:46.645
Why not put me in charge?

01:26:47.528 --> 01:26:49.758
Big mouth don't make a big man.

01:27:11.968 --> 01:27:14.198
Cimarron, come here!

01:27:28.768 --> 01:27:30.759
Them ladies ain't got their dresses on.

01:27:30.848 --> 01:27:32.122
No, they ain't.

01:27:32.248 --> 01:27:34.603
They sure are pretty.
Wonder who they are?

01:27:34.728 --> 01:27:36.958
I don't know. LLet's go find out, huh?

01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:42.566
Girls, come on. Come on.

01:27:42.728 --> 01:27:44.719
Hurry up. Hurry up, get behind the wagon.

01:27:44.808 --> 01:27:46.127
Move, move.

01:27:52.528 --> 01:27:54.519
-'Morning, boys.
-Ma'am.

01:27:54.688 --> 01:27:56.440
'Morning, ma'am.

01:27:57.368 --> 01:27:58.881
Fine morning, isn't it?

01:27:59.648 --> 01:28:00.842
You on a drive?

01:28:00.968 --> 01:28:03.323
Yes, ma'am, we're goin' to Belle Fourche.

01:28:04.128 --> 01:28:05.641
Where's your headman?

01:28:05.728 --> 01:28:08.447
That's Mr. Andersen.
He's over at Fort Smith.

01:28:09.928 --> 01:28:11.202
All right, then.

01:28:11.688 --> 01:28:13.007
What's your name?

01:28:13.568 --> 01:28:15.047
They call me Cimarron.

01:28:16.288 --> 01:28:18.119
I'm Kate to my friends.

01:28:20.848 --> 01:28:23.681
And who's the one
with the pretty pink blush?

01:28:24.448 --> 01:28:26.040
This here's Homer.

01:28:27.208 --> 01:28:28.527
Hello, Homer.

01:28:28.768 --> 01:28:29.837
Ma'am.

01:28:31.088 --> 01:28:34.046
How many men you got in your outfit,
Cimarron?

01:28:35.968 --> 01:28:39.643
If you're going by age,
we've got two that's 15.

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:41.197
My God!

01:28:43.688 --> 01:28:46.521
If you're going by what we can do,
there's 1 1 of us.

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:47.882
No offense.

01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:51.758
In this kind of country
a poor helpless woman likes to know...

01:28:51.848 --> 01:28:53.725
...if there are any men around.

01:28:54.848 --> 01:28:57.965
Men who can take care of us
as we go along our way.

01:28:58.648 --> 01:29:00.923
Well, we're gettin' paid a man's wages.

01:29:01.728 --> 01:29:04.447
And you look man enough
to earn them too, Cimarron.

01:29:05.048 --> 01:29:07.687
Did you want me for anything,
Mrs. Collingwood?

01:29:10.528 --> 01:29:11.802
That's Phoebe.

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:16.238
You're putting too much merchandise
on display, Phoebe.

01:29:16.768 --> 01:29:20.397
You better cover some of that up
before you come down with pneumonia.

01:29:20.608 --> 01:29:23.327
Isn't this a sweet-lookin' boy?

01:29:26.328 --> 01:29:28.717
Wouldn't you like to come inside, honey?

01:29:28.848 --> 01:29:31.840
You'd be surprised how nice
we got everything fixed up.

01:29:38.648 --> 01:29:42.118
I think that Homer
just saved himself a dollar.

01:29:49.088 --> 01:29:50.521
That leaves you.

01:29:51.968 --> 01:29:54.243
Well, excuse me for sayin' so, ma'am.

01:29:56.928 --> 01:29:59.123
You're old enough to be my momma.

01:30:00.888 --> 01:30:03.482
Well, if I were, I'd teach you something.

01:30:05.048 --> 01:30:06.322
LLike what?

01:30:07.128 --> 01:30:09.084
LLike manners, for a start.

01:30:19.288 --> 01:30:20.641
'Morning, ma'am.

01:30:24.648 --> 01:30:27.924
Will you see the boys return to work
while I chat with this lady?

01:30:28.368 --> 01:30:29.483
Ma'am.

01:30:36.728 --> 01:30:38.559
My name's Nightlinger...

01:30:38.808 --> 01:30:40.639
...and I'm in charge of these boys.

01:30:40.728 --> 01:30:43.162
I'm Mrs. Collingwood and...

01:30:43.688 --> 01:30:45.519
...I'm in charge of these girls.

01:30:45.608 --> 01:30:48.566
Well, I just heard
from a highly excited youngster...

01:30:48.728 --> 01:30:51.879
...that there were some soiled doves
swinging through here.

01:30:56.288 --> 01:30:57.767
What do you want from me?

01:30:57.848 --> 01:30:59.839
Madam, you know young boys.

01:30:59.968 --> 01:31:02.687
They dream of golden skin
and unbound hair.

01:31:03.528 --> 01:31:06.838
Even if I could lock them up
they'd find a way of getting here.

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:10.162
There's very little I can do about that.

01:31:10.328 --> 01:31:13.001
I'm sure you'd handle everything
most tastefully.

01:31:14.048 --> 01:31:18.166
It's a question of waiting for a more
appropriate time in their lives.

01:31:19.568 --> 01:31:22.241
Perhaps it would be wiser
to wait until next year.

01:31:22.448 --> 01:31:23.961
Or even the year after.

01:31:25.168 --> 01:31:27.682
With any luck I'll be retired by then.

01:31:33.888 --> 01:31:36.641
The first time should be
in the back of a buggy with...

01:31:36.728 --> 01:31:38.844
...a girl they think they're in love with.

01:31:42.208 --> 01:31:43.323
All right.

01:31:44.168 --> 01:31:45.362
We'll move on.

01:31:46.888 --> 01:31:49.322
You're a charming and sensible lady.

01:31:53.568 --> 01:31:54.967
What about you?

01:31:56.768 --> 01:31:58.759
Well, I have the inclination...

01:31:59.608 --> 01:32:02.168
...the maturity and the wherewithal...

01:32:03.368 --> 01:32:06.326
...but unfortunately, I don't have the time.

01:32:41.448 --> 01:32:42.563
You got 'em?

01:32:42.648 --> 01:32:43.637
Yeah.

01:32:49.168 --> 01:32:50.647
Can you fix it?

01:32:50.888 --> 01:32:52.082
I think so.

01:32:52.568 --> 01:32:54.399
Catch us by suppertime?

01:32:55.048 --> 01:32:56.401
Do what I can.

01:32:56.528 --> 01:32:58.758
Homer, drop out and help him.

01:33:23.888 --> 01:33:25.526
-Mr. Andersen....
-I know.

01:33:26.488 --> 01:33:29.685
They've been parallelin' us
for the better part of an hour.

01:33:30.048 --> 01:33:32.482
-What do you suppose they want?
-The herd.

01:33:32.608 --> 01:33:36.157
Now you just go on about your business
like you hadn't seen 'em.

01:33:36.328 --> 01:33:38.319
I'll pass the word to the rest.

01:34:07.768 --> 01:34:09.998
Think you can do somethin' kinda ticklish?

01:34:10.088 --> 01:34:11.123
Sure.

01:34:11.448 --> 01:34:13.279
I want you to fade back and...

01:34:14.008 --> 01:34:15.680
...find Mr. Nightlinger.

01:34:15.928 --> 01:34:17.122
What'll I tell him?

01:34:17.208 --> 01:34:19.676
Tell him to load his gun
and hightail it up here.

01:34:19.768 --> 01:34:21.042
Yes, sir.

01:34:33.408 --> 01:34:34.602
Mr. Andersen?

01:34:35.648 --> 01:34:37.286
I can't find Weedy.

01:34:37.648 --> 01:34:41.243
Well, I sent him back after Mr. Nightlinger
a couple of hours ago.

01:34:41.688 --> 01:34:43.644
I don't know where the hell they are!

01:34:43.728 --> 01:34:46.003
LLooks like we're gonna have a cold supper.

01:34:46.088 --> 01:34:47.521
You want me to go?

01:34:47.808 --> 01:34:50.242
Son, I wish we could all go, but...

01:34:50.808 --> 01:34:53.038
...we gotta stay put right here.

01:34:54.608 --> 01:34:57.327
Here's some jerky.
Take a piece and pass it on.

01:35:19.888 --> 01:35:21.480
As soon as it's dark...

01:35:22.408 --> 01:35:24.000
...they'll be comin' in.

01:35:25.048 --> 01:35:26.606
They're after the herd.

01:35:28.088 --> 01:35:30.921
I don't know who they are
or how rough they'll get.

01:35:32.288 --> 01:35:36.361
But right now they think
we're one man and a bunch of kids.

01:35:37.648 --> 01:35:40.082
And that's what we're gonna let 'em think.

01:35:40.368 --> 01:35:43.485
I know you're more than that, a lot more...

01:35:44.328 --> 01:35:46.922
...but this is no time to try and prove it.

01:35:47.608 --> 01:35:51.317
You act like you just came out
of Ellen Price's grammar school and...

01:35:51.888 --> 01:35:53.401
...you'll be all right.

01:35:54.208 --> 01:35:56.597
Now scatter and get us some firewood.

01:36:08.048 --> 01:36:10.926
-What's the matter with you?
-I should have told you.

01:36:11.248 --> 01:36:12.806
Told me what?

01:36:13.128 --> 01:36:15.562
They've been following us for a long time.

01:36:15.728 --> 01:36:18.196
I should have told you, but I was scared.

01:36:18.288 --> 01:36:20.882
-They said they'd kill me.
-Who said that?

01:36:20.968 --> 01:36:23.880
The man with the long hair
who came looking for work.

01:36:29.168 --> 01:36:31.921
Don't worry, Dan. It's not your fault.

01:36:33.288 --> 01:36:34.880
You got plenty of guts.

01:36:35.848 --> 01:36:38.999
Now get out there and give 'em a hand
gettin' that firewood.

01:36:52.928 --> 01:36:53.997
Hello, there.

01:37:00.048 --> 01:37:01.720
Remember what I told you.

01:37:14.168 --> 01:37:16.045
Well, bless my soul.

01:37:17.488 --> 01:37:20.480
If it ain't Mr. Wil Andersen
of the Double-O!

01:37:25.568 --> 01:37:29.561
We knew it was gonna take you
a long time herdin' little boys and cows...

01:37:31.328 --> 01:37:34.638
...but ain't no way we thought
it was gonna take you this long.

01:37:37.128 --> 01:37:39.164
Winter's comin' on, ol' friend...

01:37:40.488 --> 01:37:43.480
...and we gotta get these cattle
to Belle Fourche.

01:37:45.288 --> 01:37:46.767
How far would you say it is?

01:37:46.928 --> 01:37:48.202
I didn't say.

01:37:50.048 --> 01:37:51.447
If you was to say.

01:37:53.808 --> 01:37:55.446
Four or five days.

01:37:59.568 --> 01:38:01.399
Two or three is more like it.

01:38:04.488 --> 01:38:06.001
You know, I'm hungry.

01:38:07.208 --> 01:38:10.006
And I remember you had
a chuck wagon and a nigger.

01:38:10.288 --> 01:38:11.562
Where are they?

01:38:12.288 --> 01:38:15.963
They're behind us. I sent a boy back
to find out what was holding him up.

01:38:16.048 --> 01:38:17.606
Well, I know the boy.

01:38:19.368 --> 01:38:20.881
Bring him on in here.

01:38:24.368 --> 01:38:27.599
I don't suppose you mean
this stalwart young man here, do ya?

01:38:32.768 --> 01:38:34.201
Are you all right, boy?

01:38:34.288 --> 01:38:35.323
Yes, sir.

01:38:35.408 --> 01:38:36.636
Mr. Andersen...

01:38:37.368 --> 01:38:41.247
...do I look like the kinda man to you
that would beat on an innocent boy?

01:38:44.128 --> 01:38:47.279
You look like the vermin-ridden
son of a bitch you are.

01:38:49.048 --> 01:38:51.323
Well, my sainted momma didn't think so.

01:38:54.008 --> 01:38:55.999
You get over there and sit down.

01:38:57.208 --> 01:38:58.846
Go on. Now!

01:38:59.728 --> 01:39:00.683
And sit down!

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:03.202
And the rest of you boys, sit down,
right now!

01:39:09.408 --> 01:39:10.761
Now ol' friend...

01:39:11.728 --> 01:39:13.286
...I'll have the gun.

01:39:13.808 --> 01:39:15.036
That's right.

01:39:25.328 --> 01:39:28.400
I'll also have the belt,
'cause you ain't gonna need it.

01:39:35.408 --> 01:39:36.602
That's good.

01:39:41.008 --> 01:39:43.442
Pick it up and bring it over to me.

01:39:52.008 --> 01:39:53.566
I don't think you heard what I said!

01:39:53.648 --> 01:39:57.607
I said to bend over, pick up the belt
and bring it right here to me, now!

01:40:24.088 --> 01:40:25.282
Pride.

01:40:25.928 --> 01:40:27.520
Stubborn pride.

01:40:29.288 --> 01:40:30.721
I admire that.

01:40:32.568 --> 01:40:34.160
That truly is...

01:40:35.408 --> 01:40:37.046
...an admirable quality.

01:40:38.528 --> 01:40:41.679
To tell you the truth,
I wouldn't have picked it up, either.

01:40:46.968 --> 01:40:48.401
Mr. Andersen...

01:40:48.568 --> 01:40:51.685
...how much would you say
that them cattle are worth apiece?

01:40:54.688 --> 01:40:55.882
$15?

01:40:56.728 --> 01:40:57.922
$16?

01:40:58.408 --> 01:40:59.966
Maybe $17 a head?

01:41:02.368 --> 01:41:03.687
Now, old friend...

01:41:06.088 --> 01:41:08.841
...I am ready to be rich.

01:41:19.008 --> 01:41:20.487
You, come here!

01:41:22.048 --> 01:41:23.686
Right now! Get up!

01:41:31.648 --> 01:41:33.843
You kept our little secret, didn't ya?

01:41:35.688 --> 01:41:37.326
-Answer him.
-Yes, sir.

01:41:38.648 --> 01:41:40.445
You don't listen to him anymore.

01:41:40.528 --> 01:41:42.962
You gotta look to me now,
you understand that?

01:41:43.048 --> 01:41:45.323
-How old are you?
-I just turned 13.

01:41:45.848 --> 01:41:46.917
Really?

01:41:47.008 --> 01:41:49.522
By the time I was your age,
I had already killed a man.

01:41:49.608 --> 01:41:51.758
-You done anything like that?
-No, sir.

01:41:51.848 --> 01:41:53.201
I'll bet not.

01:41:53.448 --> 01:41:56.326
-You're the runt of your family, ain't ya?
-Yes, sir.

01:41:57.568 --> 01:41:59.126
Where are your glasses?

01:41:59.208 --> 01:42:01.403
You had some glasses. Where are they?

01:42:07.968 --> 01:42:09.959
Son, there's no glass in there.

01:42:12.848 --> 01:42:14.566
You musta broken 'em, huh?

01:42:16.328 --> 01:42:17.727
Say, look at that...

01:42:18.768 --> 01:42:21.043
...I can see myself back home now.

01:42:23.368 --> 01:42:25.279
And all them carpetbaggers
calling me mister.

01:42:29.048 --> 01:42:33.280
I'd like 'em back when you're through.
They've been in my family for a long time.

01:42:34.368 --> 01:42:36.404
Well, you can have 'em back. Here.

01:42:38.008 --> 01:42:39.282
All right.

01:42:40.248 --> 01:42:42.398
We've seen what you can do with a boy.

01:42:42.488 --> 01:42:44.877
How are you when they come
a little bigger?

01:42:46.888 --> 01:42:48.116
You mean you?

01:42:48.328 --> 01:42:51.604
Yeah. Why don't you tell your boys
to just sit this one out?

01:42:55.568 --> 01:42:57.923
You love to make it happen, don't ya?

01:42:58.408 --> 01:42:59.966
You havin' any of it?

01:43:01.128 --> 01:43:02.527
Well, sir, you're...

01:43:03.968 --> 01:43:05.367
...a pretty old man.

01:43:05.968 --> 01:43:08.436
Yeah, I'm 30 years older than you are.

01:43:09.088 --> 01:43:12.046
Had my back broke once and my hip twice.

01:43:12.728 --> 01:43:15.879
And on my worst day
I could beat the hell out of you.

01:43:16.568 --> 01:43:17.842
I don't think so.

01:43:18.488 --> 01:43:19.716
You will.

01:43:24.848 --> 01:43:27.078
Get away from him! Get away from him!

01:43:29.608 --> 01:43:31.997
You're mine. All mine.

01:43:33.008 --> 01:43:35.602
Now, come on, you get up,
you son of a bitch.

01:45:13.888 --> 01:45:15.480
You miserable wretch!

01:45:17.848 --> 01:45:18.883
Mount up!

01:45:19.008 --> 01:45:20.805
Stop, you son of a bitch!

01:45:20.928 --> 01:45:21.917
Go to hell!

01:45:22.008 --> 01:45:24.397
Turn around!
I want you to see this comin'!

01:45:24.768 --> 01:45:25.917
I said, stop!

01:45:31.168 --> 01:45:33.124
You're mine, you old bastard.

01:45:41.568 --> 01:45:42.842
LLeave him alone!

01:45:42.968 --> 01:45:44.083
Get back.

01:45:44.168 --> 01:45:46.124
Clear back, all of you.

01:46:29.008 --> 01:46:30.282
We're leavin'.

01:46:31.608 --> 01:46:34.486
-What about them kids?
-They're not goin' nowhere.

01:46:34.688 --> 01:46:36.679
Take everything but the fire.

01:47:22.288 --> 01:47:24.324
-What happened here?
-Rustlers.

01:47:24.408 --> 01:47:27.081
They've been followin' us
since we started out.

01:47:40.048 --> 01:47:41.879
Why would they do this to him?

01:47:42.288 --> 01:47:44.438
Mr. Andersen put up a fight.

01:47:46.488 --> 01:47:48.319
Ain't there anything we can do for him?

01:47:48.448 --> 01:47:49.642
Yes, there is.

01:47:51.128 --> 01:47:52.356
You can be men.

01:47:52.648 --> 01:47:53.922
Mr. Nightlinger...

01:47:55.088 --> 01:47:57.044
...you're scarin' the boys.

01:47:58.808 --> 01:48:00.207
You wanna sit up?

01:48:00.808 --> 01:48:01.797
No.

01:48:02.848 --> 01:48:04.600
Could you drink some whisky?

01:48:05.168 --> 01:48:06.078
No.

01:48:07.928 --> 01:48:09.247
Is there anything...?

01:48:10.928 --> 01:48:12.566
I want you to see that...

01:48:13.768 --> 01:48:15.520
...these boys all get home.

01:48:16.688 --> 01:48:17.803
I will.

01:48:20.528 --> 01:48:21.802
Summer's over.

01:48:24.088 --> 01:48:25.362
Just about.

01:48:33.368 --> 01:48:34.881
I'm proud of ya.

01:48:36.808 --> 01:48:37.957
All of ya.

01:48:39.568 --> 01:48:41.320
Every man wants his...

01:48:42.048 --> 01:48:43.640
...children to be...

01:48:44.208 --> 01:48:45.766
...better than he was.

01:48:48.688 --> 01:48:49.837
You are.

01:49:11.208 --> 01:49:12.800
This may seem...

01:49:14.088 --> 01:49:16.238
...a lonesome place to leave him.

01:49:19.048 --> 01:49:20.561
But he's not alone.

01:49:22.568 --> 01:49:23.683
Because...

01:49:24.848 --> 01:49:27.237
...many of his kind rest here with him.

01:49:30.208 --> 01:49:31.436
The prairie...

01:49:32.608 --> 01:49:34.803
...was like a mother to Mr. Andersen.

01:49:36.848 --> 01:49:38.406
He belonged to her.

01:49:40.408 --> 01:49:42.763
She cared for him while he lived...

01:49:50.208 --> 01:49:52.085
...and she's nursing him...

01:49:54.008 --> 01:49:55.487
...while he sleeps.

01:50:22.248 --> 01:50:23.567
What?

01:50:38.248 --> 01:50:39.727
What are you doing?

01:50:58.248 --> 01:51:02.082
We didn't want to do it this way,
but we knew you wouldn't give 'em to us.

01:51:02.528 --> 01:51:04.325
So, we're gonna get the herd back...

01:51:04.448 --> 01:51:06.564
...and take it on to Belle Fourche.

01:51:07.408 --> 01:51:09.558
You're gonna get yourselves killed.

01:51:10.968 --> 01:51:12.606
We're gonna finish a job.

01:51:35.288 --> 01:51:36.801
Better have a plan.

01:51:38.808 --> 01:51:41.038
Turn me loose and we'll make one.

01:51:43.408 --> 01:51:44.682
Cut him loose.

01:52:50.408 --> 01:52:51.557
Dung heap!

01:55:55.328 --> 01:55:56.727
Come on in!

01:56:02.208 --> 01:56:04.403
What the hell's the matter with them?

01:56:07.408 --> 01:56:08.523
Mount up!

01:57:19.568 --> 01:57:20.796
LLook at that.

01:57:21.408 --> 01:57:22.602
Come on.

01:58:09.488 --> 01:58:12.400
You've been behind this all the time,
ain't ya, nigger?

01:58:12.488 --> 01:58:14.683
Not at first, but I came round to it.

01:58:14.808 --> 01:58:17.242
You take your hat off
when you talk to me, mister!

01:58:18.888 --> 01:58:22.847
Now you're actin' mighty calm
considerin' what it is I got in store for you.

01:58:23.488 --> 01:58:26.480
What have you got to show me
that I haven't seen before?

01:58:26.568 --> 01:58:28.559
Don't you sass me, you black!

01:58:30.248 --> 01:58:31.567
Give me that rope.

01:58:33.928 --> 01:58:35.077
This is what?

01:58:35.248 --> 01:58:38.001
You ever seen one of these?
You ever seen a nigger run?

01:58:38.088 --> 01:58:39.407
Come on! Come on!

01:58:41.608 --> 01:58:43.326
Get up! Get up!

01:58:55.248 --> 01:58:56.966
Since you mean to hang me...

01:58:57.248 --> 01:58:59.284
...I'd like to atone to my Maker.

01:59:04.088 --> 01:59:05.487
You got one minute.

01:59:06.608 --> 01:59:07.882
Speak your piece.

01:59:08.048 --> 01:59:09.367
Where to begin?

01:59:11.888 --> 01:59:14.448
I regret having trifled with married women.

01:59:16.408 --> 01:59:19.286
I'm thoroughly ashamed
of having cheated at cards.

01:59:21.368 --> 01:59:24.405
I deplore my occasional departures
from the truth.

01:59:27.248 --> 01:59:29.637
Forgive me for taking Your name in vain...

01:59:30.128 --> 01:59:32.926
...my Saturday drunkenness,
my Sunday sloth.

01:59:35.528 --> 01:59:36.802
Above all...

01:59:38.368 --> 01:59:40.928
...forgive me for the men I've killed
in anger...

01:59:41.488 --> 01:59:43.399
...and for those I'm about to.

02:01:54.168 --> 02:01:55.999
I think my leg is broken.

02:01:59.128 --> 02:02:00.481
Don't let him get up.

02:02:00.568 --> 02:02:02.718
Oh, my God, don't let him get up.

02:02:08.768 --> 02:02:10.486
I think my leg is broke.

02:02:13.688 --> 02:02:16.156
The other one is hung up.

02:02:23.368 --> 02:02:24.437
You!

02:02:26.168 --> 02:02:27.920
Son, please cut me loose.

02:02:28.728 --> 02:02:29.797
Please!

02:02:30.408 --> 02:02:32.000
I'll make it worth your while.

02:02:32.568 --> 02:02:33.717
I promise.

02:02:44.208 --> 02:02:45.436
Oh, thank you.

02:02:55.448 --> 02:02:56.676
Don't! Don't!

02:02:57.728 --> 02:02:59.127
Stop him!

02:02:59.208 --> 02:03:00.561
Stop him!

02:03:01.528 --> 02:03:03.086
Stop him!

02:03:06.288 --> 02:03:07.801
Stop him!

02:04:25.448 --> 02:04:27.120
They're just kids!

02:05:15.208 --> 02:05:17.039
Now what do you want on it?

02:05:20.808 --> 02:05:22.526
His name. Wil Andersen.

02:05:27.248 --> 02:05:28.522
Anything else?

02:05:31.208 --> 02:05:32.243
LLike what?

02:05:32.328 --> 02:05:35.365
Well, it's usual to say something like,
''Rest in Peace.''

02:05:36.328 --> 02:05:37.602
''Eternal Sleep.''

02:05:37.728 --> 02:05:39.366
''In Fond Memory of....''

02:05:44.128 --> 02:05:45.766
Was he a family man?

02:05:46.288 --> 02:05:47.926
Did he have any children?

02:05:48.728 --> 02:05:49.683
Yes.

02:05:50.368 --> 02:05:53.087
Well, then I carve:
''Beloved Husband and Father.''

02:05:58.528 --> 02:05:59.847
That'd be fine.

02:06:03.488 --> 02:06:04.807
I don't see it.

02:06:05.168 --> 02:06:06.999
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

02:06:07.088 --> 02:06:08.646
I remember that tree.

02:06:10.128 --> 02:06:12.084
There must've been a heavy rain.

02:06:12.208 --> 02:06:13.436
Washed it away.

02:06:18.688 --> 02:06:20.838
We ain't never gonna find it now.

02:06:20.968 --> 02:06:22.162
Come on in.

02:06:31.728 --> 02:06:33.446
I think it's close enough.

02:06:34.848 --> 02:06:37.123
Well, come on, we're burnin' daylight.
