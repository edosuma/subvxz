WEBVTT

00:50.592 --> 00:55.389
He moves through this town unseen,
like a ghost,

00:55.472 --> 00:59.601
and he kills at will every year.

00:59.685 --> 01:03.856
The Blissfield Butcher started
his reign of terror in 1977,

01:03.939 --> 01:06.108
and it continues to this day.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.901
A geriatric serial killer?

01:07.985 --> 01:09.194
Really?

01:09.361 --> 01:12.781
Don't underestimate a straight white man's
propensity for violence, Isaac.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.658
I don't care how fucking old they are.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.744
And your story... it's bullshit, Evan.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.705
The Butcher killed some kids,
like, in the '90s,

01:19.830 --> 01:21.123
and then 20 years ago, he disappeared.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.583
The rest is just local folklore.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.793
Yeah, but didn't the Butcher,
like, also kill

01:24.877 --> 01:26.003
a bunch of kids at prom way back when?

01:26.086 --> 01:27.796
Not prom. Homecoming.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.883
All the Blissfield Butcher stories
are centered around homecoming.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.927
And a new legend pops up every year

01:34.011 --> 01:36.096
during homecoming week
to warn Blissfield's teenagers

01:36.180 --> 01:38.557
of the dangers of "underage debauchery."

01:39.349 --> 01:41.643
What will this year's story be?

01:43.228 --> 01:46.523
Oh, my God, Isaac!

01:47.482 --> 01:48.984
I smell like cheap beer now.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.486
Hey, there's some soda water in the bar.
That usually helps.

02:11.423 --> 02:12.799
What is all this shit?

02:13.634 --> 02:15.260
Ginny's dad's an art collector.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.763
That's pretty cool.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.475
Hmm.

02:31.527 --> 02:33.070
Wow.

02:35.781 --> 02:36.949
The fuck's La Dola?

02:38.033 --> 02:39.493
Hey, there's no way to open this thing.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.538
Are you gonna help me or not?

02:42.955 --> 02:46.291
Uh, not with that attitude.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.549
Mmm-hmm!

03:43.682 --> 03:46.894
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.446
Mon...

03:57.529 --> 04:00.157
Montra... Montrach...

04:00.240 --> 04:01.783
Montrachet?

04:06.371 --> 04:07.623
Oh, shit.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.960
Yeah, nice one, Sandra.
You made me drop it.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.588
God.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.964
God, they're gonna kill me.

04:25.224 --> 04:27.476
This looks so expensive.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.061
Damn it.

04:36.485 --> 04:39.780
You know, you could at least
come down and help me clean this up.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.509
"Not with that attitude."

05:00.592 --> 05:02.094
Whatever, Isaac.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.766
One moment, please.

05:10.853 --> 05:14.314
Aggro-knocking won't
make me move any faster.

05:53.812 --> 05:54.980
Wait. What about me?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.732
You're taking too long.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.443
It's a vagina,
not an all-night drive-through.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.070
Can we go three more minutes?
That's all I need.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.864
You know, that's really inconsiderate.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.991
Yeah, 'cause guys are
always so considerate.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.075
Maybe a handy?

06:22.424 --> 06:23.800
Help!

08:26.673 --> 08:27.883
Daddy.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.754
Did you see the car
at the end of the driveway?

09:05.838 --> 09:07.256
- No.
- I did.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.092
She better not have boys over.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.927
Oh, if she does, I'm gonna fucking...

09:13.720 --> 09:15.931
Oh, my God!

09:54.428 --> 09:55.929
Millie, breakfast!

10:03.061 --> 10:04.521
- Good morning.
- Morning.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.398
It smells so good.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.234
Banana pancakes, Kessler family recipe.

10:09.318 --> 10:10.402
Mmm.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.117
- I'll take mine to go.
- Hey. No, no, no.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.452
Come sit down.

10:18.744 --> 10:20.120
Let's eat like a family for a change.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.164
Family. Right.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.089
See? Isn't this nice?

10:31.965 --> 10:34.009
It feels like we hardly ever
do this anymore

10:34.092 --> 10:35.302
since your-your dad...

10:35.385 --> 10:36.929
So, Millie,

10:37.429 --> 10:38.972
do you have a date
for homecoming tomorrow?

10:39.056 --> 10:41.767
I, um... I'm not... I'm not going.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.143
She has a date with me.

10:43.227 --> 10:45.729
We're going to see <i>Wicked</i>
at the Anus Theater.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.272
"Ann-is."

10:48.857 --> 10:49.858
Wow.

10:49.942 --> 10:50.943
What?

10:51.026 --> 10:52.027
Nothing.

10:53.028 --> 10:56.949
It just seems a little weird to miss out
on a seminal high school experience

10:57.032 --> 10:59.159
to go see shit regional theater
with your mom.

10:59.243 --> 11:02.162
Oh, I'm sorry. Aren't you
supposed to discourage her

11:02.246 --> 11:03.413
from things like that?

11:03.997 --> 11:06.583
You know it's just underage drinking

11:06.667 --> 11:09.503
and God knows what else
that can end in tragedy.

11:09.586 --> 11:13.215
Oh, her night is still ending in tragedy.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.633
Charlene.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.219
Yeah, I mean, you want to go.
You're excited, right, Millie?

11:18.220 --> 11:19.680
Yeah. Of course.

11:26.395 --> 11:28.063
I got to go. The sheriff says it's urgent.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.498
Mmm.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.209
Pancakes are really good, Mom.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.962
Oh. Thanks, honey.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.847
Keep up, ladies.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.939
Morning, Millie.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.317
Hi, Mr. Daniels.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.027
Say hello.

12:15.110 --> 12:18.113
Hello. You're so cute.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.784
I love your black wiener, Mr. Daniels.

12:24.286 --> 12:25.287
Joshua.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.830
The dog is black, Nyla.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.540
Let's go far.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.042
Oh, my God.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.588
- I-I couldn't.
- Millie, you promised.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.007
I know, but she made me feel so bad.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.218
Your mom's superpower is guilt.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.303
Now you're gonna miss the homecoming dance

12:41.386 --> 12:43.889
to go watch some hag in green face
hanging from a wire?

12:43.972 --> 12:45.390
Come on. Tit up.

12:45.474 --> 12:47.309
It's just a stupid dance.
Why do you want to go, anyway?

12:47.476 --> 12:49.186
I have to shoot it for yearbook.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.064
I'm in it for the drunk straight boys
who will suddenly realize they're fluid.

12:52.356 --> 12:54.650
- That sounds kind of rapey.
- Good.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.152
Have you seen what's
on the menu in this town?

12:58.820 --> 13:00.656
- Is that the mailman?
- Oh, my God.

13:00.739 --> 13:03.200
Welcome to Tragicstan.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.160
- And hello.
- Oh, my...

13:05.244 --> 13:07.329
Booker is gonna be at the dance.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.414
This is your chance to land that plane.

13:09.498 --> 13:12.251
I'm not landing that plane or any plane.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.461
He hardly knows I exist.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.214
Are you serious?
You're a fucking piece, girl.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.049
- Oh, I'm a piece?
- Uh-huh.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.135
Okay, barf choice of words
or not, Joshua's right.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.221
You got it, Mill. You just need to own it.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.265
See? Even Miss Word Police agrees.

13:26.348 --> 13:27.975
You're going. That's final.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.103
Hey, Mill, hold on a sec.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.648
It's been a year.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.193
You can't keep living your life
for someone else.

13:38.277 --> 13:40.362
You've got to start doing things for you.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.031
Yeah, it's just...

13:43.824 --> 13:45.242
It's not that easy.

13:46.743 --> 13:47.995
My dad was her whole world.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.998
I get it. I really do.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.583
You don't want to hurt
your mom's feelings.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.835
It's why I love you.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.922
I just... I don't want you
to wake up one morning

13:59.006 --> 14:04.219
and realize your whole life passed you by
'cause you were busy being everything

14:04.303 --> 14:06.013
to everyone but you.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.310
I'll see you at lunch, okay?

14:12.477 --> 14:14.188
- I love you.
- I love you.

14:34.291 --> 14:38.128
Whoo!

14:42.466 --> 14:44.176
Millie, hi.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.262
Hi, Ryler.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.015
I love your dress.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.392
- Thanks.
- Where'd you get it?

14:52.476 --> 14:54.895
I... don't know.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.314
I, um... I've had it a long time.

14:58.315 --> 15:00.108
I think I saw it at Discount Bonanza.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.694
I had to pee.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.404
Did your mom use her employee discount?

15:07.699 --> 15:10.327
Anyway, you look adorbs, seriously.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.125
God.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.517
Oh, my...

15:36.019 --> 15:38.021
And I did a common A-frame,

15:38.146 --> 15:41.024
but with delicate detail
to the window framing.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.112
Any dog would kill
to call this their home.

15:45.529 --> 15:47.197
If you installed some speakers,

15:47.865 --> 15:50.951
threw down a rug,
it'd be the ultimate pooch pad.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.039
Sorry, Mr. Bernardi.

15:56.123 --> 15:59.418
- Late again, Miss Kessler.
- It won't happen again.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.962
I doubt that. Just sit down.

16:04.339 --> 16:05.591
It's very nice.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.510
This woodwork is exceptional.

16:08.719 --> 16:10.220
- Thanks, Mr. B.
- Hey.

16:10.304 --> 16:13.056
Pro tip: always set your watch
five minutes ahead.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.349
It saves my ass, like, every time.

16:15.976 --> 16:16.977
Thanks.

16:17.853 --> 16:19.146
ChÃ¢teau Fido.

16:19.813 --> 16:20.898
Come on.

16:21.273 --> 16:22.649
Great work, Phil.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.943
Once again, setting the class standard.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.072
Next up is...

16:29.489 --> 16:32.034
Oh, Millie Kessler.

16:33.118 --> 16:34.620
Time to present your doghouse.

16:35.037 --> 16:39.458
Uh, my presentation
isn't scheduled till next week.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.126
This isn't debate class.

16:41.460 --> 16:44.630
But you said the 16th.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.132
Um, it's not ready yet.

16:49.510 --> 16:53.555
Once again, Miss Kessler
is holding up the class.

16:53.639 --> 16:57.726
And once again,
Miss Kessler is unprepared.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.270
Dick.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.939
Something to add, Booker?

17:02.731 --> 17:03.899
Nope.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.029
Can I just... do it the 16th?

17:09.112 --> 17:10.696
Can I just do it the 16th?

17:10.781 --> 17:11.781
Speak up.

17:13.659 --> 17:18.747
Oh, crocodile tear doesn't excuse
your poor planning, Miss Kessler.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.345
My God.

17:34.972 --> 17:37.766
This is completely bonkers.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.102
I'm in shock.

17:40.978 --> 17:44.398
I just saw Sandra two days ago in PE.

17:44.481 --> 17:45.816
And now she's...

17:46.358 --> 17:48.735
Oh, my God. It's a slaughterhouse.

17:49.444 --> 17:50.946
Are you smiling?

17:51.029 --> 17:52.906
Everybody is freaking out.

17:53.699 --> 17:54.700
Check it out.

17:55.158 --> 17:58.871
<i>Ginny was one of my best friends.</i>

17:59.037 --> 18:00.080
<i>Why?</i>

18:00.163 --> 18:01.748
Bitch, please.

18:01.832 --> 18:03.417
Ginny hated Ryler

18:03.500 --> 18:05.210
after she started that rumor
about Ginny getting a carrot

18:05.294 --> 18:07.212
- stuck in her pussy.
- Don't say that word.

18:07.296 --> 18:09.173
Whatever. Vagina.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.091
Who would do something like this?

18:11.175 --> 18:12.342
The Blissfield Butcher.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.262
He's just an urban legend. He's not real.

18:15.345 --> 18:16.805
Mmm, four very dead teens.

18:16.972 --> 18:19.183
It seems pretty real to me.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.642
They're gonna have to cancel homecoming.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.394
Please.

18:22.477 --> 18:24.605
Homecoming is like Christmas around here.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.356
They're not canceling it.

18:33.655 --> 18:34.990
Told ya.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.533
Hail, hail, Blissfield High!

18:36.617 --> 18:38.744
Chomp, chomp, chomp, our battle cry!

18:38.827 --> 18:39.912
Yo, guys, check this, check this.

18:39.995 --> 18:44.124
When our Beavers come to fight,
feel our glory and our might!

18:45.584 --> 18:47.461
Only beaver nobody would touch!

18:48.921 --> 18:52.299
I mean, if you brown-bag her face,
she's sort of doable.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.809
I smell like orange soda.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.686
It's not that bad.

19:04.770 --> 19:07.564
You should quit. It is not worth it.

19:07.648 --> 19:10.108
Extracurriculars look good
on applications.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.861
As if your mom would ever
let you go away to college.

19:13.695 --> 19:14.905
Hey.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.617
She's late. Again.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.286
- You sure you don't want a ride?
- Yeah.

19:21.537 --> 19:23.789
Yeah, she'll be here. She
probably just stopped for gas.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.749
- You want us to wait with you?
- Mmm-mmm.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.877
There is a psycho roaming free.

19:28.961 --> 19:30.587
No.

19:30.671 --> 19:33.006
I'm good. There's plenty of people around.

19:33.090 --> 19:34.508
And she'll be here any minute.

19:35.676 --> 19:37.344
I'm good. Just go.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.056
Okay.

19:45.727 --> 19:46.979
Bye, Mill.

19:47.062 --> 19:49.189
- Bye. Love you.
- Bye-bye. Love you, poodle.

19:49.273 --> 19:51.358
Thank you very much.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.277
- Love you.
- Love you.

19:54.570 --> 19:57.406
- Bye.
- Bye!

20:21.889 --> 20:25.767
<i>And it's yours, right now, for only 46...</i>

20:40.240 --> 20:41.783
Goddamn it.

20:46.997 --> 20:47.998
Shit.

20:51.710 --> 20:52.711
Hi.

20:52.794 --> 20:55.923
<i>She's passed out on the couch again.</i>

20:56.006 --> 20:57.424
Can you come get...

20:57.508 --> 20:59.301
You've got to be kidding me right now.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.407
<i>She'll be</i>

21:22.491 --> 21:26.119
<i>Comin' round the mountain when she comes</i>

21:26.203 --> 21:30.791
<i>She'll be comin' round
The mountain when she comes</i>

21:30.874 --> 21:33.085
<i>She'll be comin' round the mountain</i>

21:33.168 --> 21:35.712
<i>She'll be comin' round the mountain</i>

21:37.005 --> 21:39.800
<i>He'll be comin'...</i>

21:44.721 --> 21:46.223
Please don't be the Butcher.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.724
Please don't be the Butcher.
Please don't be the Butcher.

21:53.814 --> 21:56.275
My sister's gonna be here any second!

21:56.358 --> 21:57.568
She's a cop!

22:01.822 --> 22:03.240
With a gun!

22:15.919 --> 22:17.379
Shit.

22:19.173 --> 22:22.843
Help! Help me!

22:23.177 --> 22:25.179
Help!

22:25.262 --> 22:27.347
No!

22:28.891 --> 22:29.892
No!

22:30.976 --> 22:32.019
No!

24:06.822 --> 24:08.740
No! No!

24:10.951 --> 24:12.452
No!

24:12.536 --> 24:15.289
No! No! No! No!

24:16.832 --> 24:18.834
No!

24:27.509 --> 24:29.011
No!

24:42.733 --> 24:44.234
Get away from her!

24:48.071 --> 24:50.616
Millie! Millie!

24:50.699 --> 24:52.326
Oh, my God!

24:53.160 --> 24:55.078
6542 to dispatch.

24:55.162 --> 24:57.706
I need an ambulance at my location ASAP!

24:59.166 --> 25:00.292
Hey.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.127
You're okay. You're okay.

25:02.211 --> 25:05.047
- It hurt him, too.
- You're in shock. It's okay.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.840
- Help's coming, okay?
- It hurt him, too.

25:06.924 --> 25:08.300
It's okay. It's okay. Help's coming.

25:08.383 --> 25:09.468
Help's on the way.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.678
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

25:22.606 --> 25:24.816
<i>You want us to wait with you?</i>

25:24.900 --> 25:27.236
<i>There is a psycho roaming free.</i>

25:27.319 --> 25:29.029
<i>There's plenty of people around.</i>

25:29.112 --> 25:30.447
<i>She'll be here any minute.</i>

25:41.708 --> 25:44.795
<i>Millie! Millie!</i>

25:44.878 --> 25:46.713
<i>Oh, my God! What happened?</i>

25:46.797 --> 25:48.590
<i>What happened to you?</i>

25:48.674 --> 25:51.343
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

26:12.573 --> 26:15.117
No, it wasn't my fault!

26:15.200 --> 26:17.703
I know. But I was just coming home.

26:17.786 --> 26:20.205
I was gonna sleep until 4:30.

26:20.289 --> 26:22.249
I was so tired. I had one glass of wine.

26:22.332 --> 26:23.959
You did not have one glass of wine!

26:24.042 --> 26:25.836
No, you had an entire bottle
of wine to drink.

26:25.919 --> 26:28.380
- It was one glass of wine!
- Yeah, right.

26:48.192 --> 26:50.485
<i>Sleep till morning.</i>

26:50.569 --> 26:52.571
<i>Rest. Sleep.</i>

26:54.990 --> 26:57.159
<i>La Dola.</i>

27:45.457 --> 27:47.376
Hey.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.086
Good. You're up.

27:49.670 --> 27:51.129
How are you feeling?

27:54.466 --> 27:55.467
Okay, then.

27:57.678 --> 27:58.971
How's your shoulder?

28:06.770 --> 28:08.313
You know what?

28:08.397 --> 28:10.148
Let's go get manicures after work, huh?

28:13.610 --> 28:15.362
Okay, then.
Well, I'm gonna give you a minute.

28:15.445 --> 28:19.825
And, uh, I made French toast,
with your favorite:

28:20.075 --> 28:22.411
caramelized bananas.

28:25.873 --> 28:26.874
Okay.

29:03.452 --> 29:05.078
Mill, come on.

29:05.162 --> 29:07.080
Food's getting cold.

29:30.145 --> 29:31.688
Where am I?

29:33.398 --> 29:34.650
Hello?

29:36.944 --> 29:39.279
Oh, my God. Why do I sound like that?

30:05.430 --> 30:08.392
What the fuck? Oh, Jesus.

30:12.855 --> 30:15.190
Okay. You are just hallucinating.

30:15.274 --> 30:17.609
- Hey! You got any jelly beans?
- I'm sorry.

30:17.693 --> 30:19.486
- Do I have jelly beans?
- You know, ice cubes.

30:19.570 --> 30:21.655
Uh, crunch and munch.
You got some drugs, man?

30:21.738 --> 30:23.365
Oh, my God. No, I don't have any drugs.

30:23.448 --> 30:24.575
I'm not a drug person.

30:24.741 --> 30:25.826
Uh, may I ask you a question?

30:25.951 --> 30:27.619
- What?
- Yeah. Just, you know,

30:27.703 --> 30:29.329
I'm just curious. What do I look like?

30:29.663 --> 30:31.832
Like, when you're seeing me right now?

30:32.165 --> 30:35.002
Do I look like a, um, you know,
do I look like a girl?

30:35.836 --> 30:37.296
- Girl?
- Yeah.

30:37.379 --> 30:40.841
You know, like, five-foot-five.
Very petite blond.

30:41.216 --> 30:43.760
You're fucking lying, man.

30:43.844 --> 30:46.430
You, you, you got drugs.
You're high right now.

30:46.513 --> 30:47.681
Oh, no, no. I don't have the drugs.

30:47.764 --> 30:48.807
Come on, man. Give me some of those.

30:48.891 --> 30:49.975
- That's good stuff.
- Please don't. Please don't.

30:50.058 --> 30:51.560
I want to feel like a teenage girl.
I want to feel like a girl.

30:51.643 --> 30:53.061
I said... Help me!

30:53.312 --> 30:55.314
Come on! Come back! Come back!

30:55.397 --> 30:56.940
I'll suck your dick!

30:58.233 --> 30:59.234
All of it!

31:02.279 --> 31:05.532
<i>I'm here just outside
Blissfield Valley High School,</i>

31:05.616 --> 31:08.243
<i>where a teenage girl
was viciously attacked.</i>

31:08.327 --> 31:10.621
<i>The survivor,
whose name is being withheld...</i>

31:10.704 --> 31:12.247
Oh, hey, sweetie.

31:12.748 --> 31:14.374
I didn't see you there.

31:15.292 --> 31:16.835
You're like a little ninja.

31:16.919 --> 31:18.420
Come on.

31:18.504 --> 31:20.631
Come on, I made you breakfast.

31:21.089 --> 31:23.050
Sit, silly.

31:23.133 --> 31:24.384
Come on.

31:25.802 --> 31:27.095
Here you go.

31:27.721 --> 31:30.390
I really want you to try to eat, okay?

31:35.229 --> 31:38.524
Got you some fresh pineapple.

31:38.607 --> 31:40.400
I know how much you love it.

31:40.484 --> 31:42.444
It's a good juicy one, too.

31:48.742 --> 31:50.035
Oh.

31:52.746 --> 31:54.248
Mama forgot the syrup.

31:56.542 --> 31:57.793
There you go.

31:57.876 --> 31:59.419
Try to eat something, okay?

32:01.046 --> 32:02.339
Mmm.

32:04.299 --> 32:06.093
Crispy, like you like it.

32:06.176 --> 32:07.427
Mmm.

32:08.428 --> 32:09.596
Mmm.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.224
Oh. Oh, my word.

32:12.307 --> 32:14.643
Yeah, okay. All right.
I guess you are hungry.

32:15.894 --> 32:17.813
Who on earth is...

32:23.068 --> 32:24.111
Hey, Mrs. K.

32:24.194 --> 32:25.362
Hi, Frank.

32:25.445 --> 32:29.867
I was gonna stick this in your box,
but I figured I better check on y'all.

32:29.950 --> 32:31.660
Oh, okay. Well, thank you.

32:31.743 --> 32:33.579
How... how's Millie?

32:34.371 --> 32:35.956
I heard. It's just awful.

32:36.707 --> 32:37.958
Well...

32:38.041 --> 32:41.587
I think she's a little bit in shock,
but she's gonna be okay.

32:45.132 --> 32:48.385
Mom, this house
smells like a fucking Denny's.

32:49.344 --> 32:50.888
Hey.

32:50.971 --> 32:53.015
I thought you were still sleeping.

32:57.811 --> 32:59.021
Good morning?

33:01.440 --> 33:02.774
Okay.

33:14.244 --> 33:15.829
I got it, sweetie.

33:17.956 --> 33:19.666
- Bye.
- Have a good day, honey.

33:19.750 --> 33:20.959
- Be safe.
- Thanks, Mom.

33:21.043 --> 33:22.211
Okay.

33:23.045 --> 33:25.839
Honey, I think you should go
and get some more rest.

33:27.799 --> 33:30.260
You're not thinking
of going to school, are you?

33:31.386 --> 33:32.471
School?

33:32.554 --> 33:35.516
I mean, I know your friends must be
worried about you, but...

33:38.143 --> 33:39.353
Friends.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.442
<i>The suspect,
now identified as</i>

33:45.526 --> 33:48.195
<i>Quentin Shermer, escaped
the Avondale Sanatorium,</i>

33:48.278 --> 33:51.740
<i>a maximum-security facility
for the criminally insane.</i>

33:51.823 --> 33:54.952
<i>Shermer, also known by locals
as the Blissfield Butcher,</i>

33:55.035 --> 33:57.371
<i>murdered his mother and infamously left</i>

33:57.454 --> 34:00.666
<i>her severed head
outside a Dairy Queen in 1992.</i>

34:28.235 --> 34:29.570
Mr. Daniels?

34:30.571 --> 34:31.697
Mr. Daniels, it's...

34:31.780 --> 34:33.447
Who are you?

34:33.532 --> 34:35.117
- It's okay. Oh!
- Oh!

34:35.242 --> 34:36.451
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

34:36.534 --> 34:37.661
Are you okay?

34:37.744 --> 34:38.829
It's you.

34:38.911 --> 34:40.414
- No.
- It's him!

34:40.496 --> 34:41.831
It's him!

36:32.317 --> 36:34.194
Is that...

36:35.237 --> 36:37.531
Does she look cute?

36:44.997 --> 36:47.958
What's with the outfit, Mill?

36:48.041 --> 36:51.253
Uh, I can't believe your mom
let you come to school today.

36:52.504 --> 36:53.839
Are you okay?

36:53.922 --> 36:56.049
- Ow.
- Smile for Insta.

36:57.885 --> 37:01.388
Millie, you're Blissfield's victim.
We love you.

37:01.471 --> 37:03.473
- Can you not, Ryler?
- Piss off, Ryler.

37:03.557 --> 37:05.058
This is not about you.

37:05.142 --> 37:08.020
Fuck off.

37:10.564 --> 37:13.317
And that police sketch...
of course that guy's a killer.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.736
That gross, bloated,
sweaty face and brown teeth.

37:15.819 --> 37:18.614
I mean, I don't think I've ever
seen anyone as hideous as that.

37:18.697 --> 37:20.657
- Take me.
- Uh, where?

37:22.826 --> 37:24.453
Someplace...

37:25.329 --> 37:26.371
private.

37:26.872 --> 37:28.207
Oh, my God.

37:28.290 --> 37:29.833
Something else happened
last night, didn't it?

37:29.917 --> 37:32.044
You can totally tell me.
I'm, like, the most trustworthy person.

37:40.677 --> 37:44.264
Smells like hot dog water.

37:47.643 --> 37:49.561
Fudge!

37:51.522 --> 37:54.066
I'm a giant. I'm a giant.

38:06.578 --> 38:08.622
Okay. Tell me everything.

38:14.002 --> 38:15.254
Did he...

38:16.171 --> 38:17.339
You know.

38:20.133 --> 38:21.927
I've seen "SVU." I know the signs.

38:25.514 --> 38:27.432
Uh, hello.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.241
Oh.

38:45.784 --> 38:47.119
Wait, are you...

38:48.662 --> 38:51.039
I mean, it's fine if you are.

38:54.793 --> 38:58.589
What? Honestly, Millie,
I'm missing AP bio.

38:58.672 --> 39:00.465
I didn't come here to clam-jam with you.

39:04.887 --> 39:07.014
I've had, like, ten kombuchas today,

39:07.097 --> 39:09.391
so I'm gonna go pee, and when I get back,

39:09.474 --> 39:12.144
you're either spilling the tea or I'm out.

39:13.604 --> 39:14.980
Freak.

39:26.658 --> 39:27.743
Hello?

39:38.629 --> 39:40.088
Hello?

39:53.769 --> 39:55.062
Millie?

40:19.294 --> 40:21.255
Oh. Oh, my God.

40:21.338 --> 40:22.673
Millie, The Butcher's here.

40:22.756 --> 40:25.467
- He's here. We need to go.
- You need to hide.

40:30.848 --> 40:32.599
Wha...

40:32.683 --> 40:34.768
- Are you sure this is safe?
- No.

40:36.103 --> 40:37.229
No!

40:39.523 --> 40:40.774
What was that?

40:40.858 --> 40:43.777
Millie! Millie! Millie!

40:43.861 --> 40:45.445
Millie, come back!

40:45.529 --> 40:48.448
Millie! Millie!

40:48.532 --> 40:50.075
Millie!

40:52.828 --> 40:55.873
Much better.

41:22.941 --> 41:24.193
Ryler.

41:36.121 --> 41:38.373
<i>Due to the continued attacks
on our students,</i>

41:38.457 --> 41:40.709
<i>together with the school board
and Sheriff Larkin,</i>

41:40.792 --> 41:43.003
<i>I have decided to indefinitely postpone</i>

41:43.086 --> 41:44.713
<i>tonight's homecoming dance.</i>

41:44.796 --> 41:46.465
- What?
- <i>City-wide curfew</i>

41:46.548 --> 41:48.509
<i>is in effect, starting at 8:00 p.m.</i>

41:48.592 --> 41:52.054
<i>As police continue the manhunt
for the Blissfield Butcher...</i>

41:52.137 --> 41:53.931
Miss Kessler.

41:54.014 --> 41:55.933
I'm speaking to you, Miss Kessler.

41:56.016 --> 41:57.518
<i>Stay safe, Beavers.</i>

42:05.859 --> 42:06.902
Hey.

42:09.363 --> 42:10.948
Hey, how are you holding up?

42:12.241 --> 42:13.617
Aah!

42:25.462 --> 42:26.463
Hot.

42:27.005 --> 42:28.882
Goddamn it, Millie.

42:30.342 --> 42:33.345
I am so sick of your constant
need for attention.

42:33.428 --> 42:35.556
If only you would spend
a little less time flirting

42:35.639 --> 42:36.723
and a little more time learning,

42:36.807 --> 42:39.351
you might actually
make something out of yourself.

42:47.276 --> 42:49.987
- Still nothing?
- I don't think she's coming.

42:50.070 --> 42:51.113
She's acting weird.

42:51.196 --> 42:53.782
She was almost killed last night, Ny.

42:53.866 --> 42:56.451
Maybe we let her be weird for a day.

42:56.535 --> 42:57.744
I'm just worried about her.

42:57.828 --> 42:59.872
Nyla, don't freak out.

43:01.081 --> 43:02.749
Guys.

43:05.085 --> 43:06.795
Guys!

43:09.631 --> 43:12.092
Guys, guys, listen.
It's not what you think.

43:13.552 --> 43:14.928
Come on!

43:15.721 --> 43:18.765
Balls. I got balls.

43:21.894 --> 43:23.478
- He's still following us!
- Guys!

43:23.562 --> 43:26.190
You're Black! I'm gay! We are so dead!

43:26.982 --> 43:28.901
Somebody help us, please!

43:28.984 --> 43:30.444
Nyla! Josh!

43:30.527 --> 43:32.446
Stop running. I'm not gonna hurt you.

43:32.529 --> 43:33.655
It's me. It's Millie.

43:33.739 --> 43:37.075
- What kind of sick fuck are you?
- How does he know our names?

43:37.159 --> 43:39.244
- Stop running, please.
- You stay the fuck away from us!

43:39.328 --> 43:41.705
Nyla, will you listen to me for a second?

43:42.956 --> 43:44.041
Fuck!

43:46.251 --> 43:48.045
Oh, God, I'm strong.

43:48.128 --> 43:52.090
- Come on!
- Nyla, I'm so sorry. Let's just talk.

43:52.174 --> 43:54.176
Guys. No, don't, don't!

43:54.760 --> 43:56.803
Really?

43:57.554 --> 44:00.432
Josh! Guys, stop! Will you stop, Josh?

44:01.683 --> 44:03.477
What, are you nuts?

44:03.560 --> 44:06.688
- Ow! Will you stop throwing things at me?
- Josh, get him!

44:06.772 --> 44:08.649
You got to stop!

44:09.650 --> 44:11.443
Josh!

44:13.278 --> 44:15.364
Guys! Okay, listen to me. Ow!

44:17.324 --> 44:18.867
Stop it! Stop it.

44:18.951 --> 44:20.369
Stop it.

44:21.912 --> 44:24.164
Okay. Back up. Back up.

44:24.248 --> 44:25.457
Guys, listen to me.

44:25.541 --> 44:27.125
I am not trying to hurt you, okay?

44:27.209 --> 44:30.254
If I was, would I drop my weapon?

44:30.337 --> 44:31.713
I'm your friend.

44:34.424 --> 44:36.802
Ow! Ow! Ow!

44:37.553 --> 44:39.513
Stop hitting me.

44:39.596 --> 44:41.557
Hitting's not okay, Josh.

44:41.640 --> 44:42.975
Ow!

44:43.851 --> 44:45.811
Take the shot!

44:45.894 --> 44:48.897
- I don't have one!
- Just do it! Just take the...

44:55.821 --> 44:59.157
Okay. Everyone's tired.
We've done lots of hitting.

44:59.241 --> 45:01.326
It's time to talk.

45:10.836 --> 45:13.005
Hail, hail, Blissfield High.

45:13.088 --> 45:16.049
Chomp, chomp, chomp's our battle cry.

45:16.133 --> 45:18.468
When our Beavers come to fight,

45:18.552 --> 45:20.637
feel our glory and our might.

45:21.930 --> 45:23.098
Yeah?

45:28.061 --> 45:29.146
What's your favorite movie?

45:29.229 --> 45:30.772
I tell people it's <i>Eternal Sunshine,</i>

45:30.856 --> 45:31.899
but it's <i>Pitch Perfect 2.</i>

45:33.650 --> 45:35.194
- TV show?
- <i>Sabrina.</i>

45:37.738 --> 45:39.948
- Favorite snack.
- Triple Berry Gushers.

45:42.659 --> 45:43.785
Who's your biggest crush?

45:45.621 --> 45:48.165
The Booker Hooker.

45:51.543 --> 45:52.794
Shake, bitches.

45:59.259 --> 46:00.636
Right?

46:00.719 --> 46:02.763
- Oh, my God!
- Yes.

46:03.639 --> 46:05.015
Oh, my God.

46:05.098 --> 46:07.226
- Wait a minute. How did this happen?
- How is that even possible?

46:07.309 --> 46:09.186
And guess what, I need a friend right now,

46:09.269 --> 46:12.523
and it's like, you guys are
smashing the shit out of me.

46:13.482 --> 46:15.943
He stabbed me with this, like,
weird, old-looking dagger,

46:16.026 --> 46:17.861
but when he stabbed me, we both got hurt.

46:17.945 --> 46:18.946
What do you mean?

46:19.029 --> 46:20.948
Standing and peeing is kind of rad.

46:21.573 --> 46:22.908
- Millie, focus.
- Sorry? What?

46:24.243 --> 46:26.995
- You both got hurt?
- Oh. Yeah.

46:27.079 --> 46:30.249
So, when he stabbed me,
he instantly got a wound, too,

46:30.332 --> 46:32.876
but in the exact same spot,
the left shoulder.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.503
And then, late last night, I kept hearing

46:34.586 --> 46:36.004
the dagger's name, like, this weird,

46:36.088 --> 46:38.465
like, whispering in my head:
"La Dola, La Dola."

46:38.549 --> 46:40.175
I think the Dola caused this.

46:40.259 --> 46:44.137
This is, like, three gallons of pee.
This guy's bladder is huge.

46:44.221 --> 46:45.806
- Is everything huge?
- Joshua.

46:46.515 --> 46:48.851
Wha... You know
this is the boys' room, right?

46:48.934 --> 46:51.645
She's got a dick in her hand,
and you're wearing Chanel No. 5.

46:51.728 --> 46:54.398
Think we're past labels.

46:54.481 --> 46:55.691
This is ridiculous.

46:55.774 --> 46:58.443
You guys got to see this.
This is like a floppy anteater.

46:58.527 --> 46:59.570
This it?

47:02.614 --> 47:04.324
Yes, that's it.

47:04.408 --> 47:05.742
That's the dagger.

47:06.368 --> 47:09.371
"La Dola, an ancient Aztecan dagger

47:09.454 --> 47:11.832
"used in ritual sacrifice"?

47:11.915 --> 47:13.750
- Do I wipe?
- There's writing on it.

47:13.834 --> 47:15.961
I think it's Spanish.

47:17.129 --> 47:18.589
I can't read it.

47:18.672 --> 47:20.674
Aren't you in Spanish Three?

47:20.757 --> 47:21.842
And your point?

47:21.925 --> 47:24.720
You should be able to read Spanish.

47:24.803 --> 47:26.972
Nobody pays attention in that class.

47:27.055 --> 47:29.183
Why don't we get
SeÃ±ora Cayenes to translate it?

47:36.440 --> 47:37.733
What does it say?

47:51.872 --> 47:53.207
Uh...

47:55.959 --> 47:58.587
SeÃ±or Detmer, you are in my class.

47:58.670 --> 47:59.880
Well, I'm dyslexic.

48:00.797 --> 48:02.174
I have a doctor's note.

48:04.968 --> 48:07.888
It says here, if the sacrifice
is not successful,

48:07.971 --> 48:09.765
the souls of the two persons are swapped

48:09.848 --> 48:14.102
and the change becomes
<i>permanente</i> after 24 hours.

48:14.603 --> 48:16.063
Permanent?

48:18.148 --> 48:19.274
<i>SÃ­.</i>

48:26.114 --> 48:27.741
Boys are so gross.

48:40.712 --> 48:42.923
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

48:43.006 --> 48:44.508
I'm not a cock gobbler.

48:44.591 --> 48:47.010
Hurry up, loser. I got to take a dump.

48:52.057 --> 48:54.560
Uh, I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

48:54.643 --> 48:58.564
I... I was... I was looking for,
for someone else. I...

48:58.647 --> 48:59.648
Boo!

49:00.232 --> 49:01.233
Boo!

49:02.067 --> 49:04.361
How's that feel?

49:04.444 --> 49:06.113
You like being scared?

49:06.196 --> 49:08.073
No. I'm s... I'm sorry. I di... I thought

49:08.156 --> 49:10.951
it was gonna be...

49:11.034 --> 49:12.578
Please.

49:13.912 --> 49:16.206
If you ever mess with Millie Kessler

49:16.290 --> 49:19.751
or any other kid again, I swear,

49:19.835 --> 49:24.256
I'll make you wish your buggy,
wormy, stupid face

49:24.339 --> 49:26.425
was never born. Do you got it?

49:29.178 --> 49:30.804
Oh, my God. Did you just pee yourself?

49:30.888 --> 49:32.264
- Yes!
- Ew!

49:33.390 --> 49:34.766
That's disgusting.

49:35.309 --> 49:37.477
So you're saying if I don't
stab him with the Dola

49:37.561 --> 49:39.605
by midnight, I'm gonna be stuck
in this body forever?

49:39.688 --> 49:41.315
- Yep.
- That's in, like, nine hours.

49:41.398 --> 49:44.401
- Uh, it's doable. Adjacent.
- Where's the Dola?

49:44.484 --> 49:46.195
It's at the police station
in the evidence locker.

49:46.278 --> 49:49.031
Then we better get going over there now.

49:49.114 --> 49:52.367
Guys, he's here somewhere.

49:52.451 --> 49:54.536
And he's wearing my body
and he's wearing my face.

49:54.620 --> 49:57.289
He's like a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

49:57.372 --> 49:58.957
And if we don't capture him first,

50:01.084 --> 50:03.045
God knows how many people he's gonna kill.

50:03.253 --> 50:05.047
What kind of a name is that?

50:05.964 --> 50:07.257
Stupid name.

50:12.596 --> 50:13.805
Miss Kessler.

50:15.182 --> 50:17.434
You got some nerve
stepping back in this classroom.

50:37.621 --> 50:39.414
I'm not here for your games.

50:43.544 --> 50:44.711
Turn that off!

50:50.175 --> 50:52.177
No!

50:55.722 --> 50:57.182
Ah!

51:03.605 --> 51:06.066
Self-defense. I had to do it.

51:07.651 --> 51:09.444
I'll see you in the principal's office.

51:40.392 --> 51:43.729
That's what you get
for fucking with me, missy.

52:33.487 --> 52:35.239
Ma'am.

52:40.869 --> 52:43.080
Fuck off, piggies.

52:43.163 --> 52:44.581
- Is this where he is?
- Yeah.

52:44.665 --> 52:46.500
He'll be getting out of woodshop.

52:48.752 --> 52:51.088
Whoa. What am I wearing?

52:52.840 --> 52:54.049
Stop right there.

52:54.758 --> 52:58.637
Help! Help! Oh, my God!
It's the Blissfield Butcher!

52:58.720 --> 52:59.888
- Help me! Help!
- Freeze!

52:59.972 --> 53:02.808
- Run!
- Please help! It's him!

53:05.686 --> 53:07.896
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Where's the car?

53:07.980 --> 53:10.315
- Run!
- Hurry! Hurry!

53:10.399 --> 53:13.193
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Get in the car!

53:16.071 --> 53:18.532
What's wrong with it?

53:18.615 --> 53:20.158
It's a piece of shit!
What do you want from me?

53:20.242 --> 53:21.618
Uh, guys...

53:21.702 --> 53:24.246
- Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hurry!

53:24.329 --> 53:25.914
- Go. Go. Go now.
- Go, go!

53:25.998 --> 53:28.542
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Watch out!

53:33.380 --> 53:35.966
Suspect-suspect spotted in a shit heap!

53:36.049 --> 53:37.176
Headed west from the high school!

53:37.259 --> 53:39.720
Why can't I just have a normal life?

53:39.803 --> 53:41.680
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down, Nyla.

53:41.763 --> 53:43.473
I just turned 18. I could go to prison.

53:43.557 --> 53:45.434
Nyla, can you scooch your seat
up just a little bit?

53:45.517 --> 53:47.144
Okay, we need a plan.

53:47.227 --> 53:49.396
They saw us with her,
so they're gonna be looking for us now.

53:49.479 --> 53:52.191
- Ny, can you move up a little more?
- We need to get you a disguise, Mill.

53:52.274 --> 53:54.276
You can't be walking around in
those clothes with that face.

53:54.359 --> 53:55.694
- Everyone knows who you are.
- Good plan.

53:55.777 --> 53:58.488
Nyla, could you just do
just a little, teeny, teeny,

53:58.572 --> 54:00.407
teeny, teeny, just a little bit more?

54:00.490 --> 54:03.869
- You good, Mill?
- Yeah. Much better.

54:03.952 --> 54:05.621
Suspect spotted
with two youths.

54:05.704 --> 54:09.291
Teenagers. One Black, female,
one white, uh, excited.

54:09.374 --> 54:11.043
Heading towards
the northwest corner of town.

54:12.252 --> 54:14.129
Hey, what the fuck? Are you kidding me?

54:18.050 --> 54:19.092
Shit.

54:19.176 --> 54:20.802
- What?
- It's the police.

54:23.430 --> 54:25.766
- Oh, my God. It's Char.
- Um...

54:27.351 --> 54:28.894
Ooh! Up ahead, turn left.

54:28.977 --> 54:30.938
- We can mix into the parking lot.
- No, that's my mom's...

54:31.021 --> 54:33.482
- It's our best chance! Go!
- Turn!

54:38.862 --> 54:41.114
Holy shit!

54:41.198 --> 54:42.324
Come on!

54:49.831 --> 54:52.334
<i>Discount Bonanza

Come on. We got to keep moving.

54:57.965 --> 54:59.383
Oh.

55:11.645 --> 55:13.939

Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

Millie, hide in here. Quick.

- Oh, I'm so sorry. I...
- Sorry. So sorry.

55:36.336 --> 55:37.546
I didn't know anybody was in there.

55:37.629 --> 55:39.006
- So sorry.
- No problem. Okay.

55:39.089 --> 55:40.174
You all good in there?

55:40.257 --> 55:41.925
Yeah, uh, uh, great, actually.

55:42.009 --> 55:43.177
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Sure, sure.

55:43.260 --> 55:46.513
Just, uh, trying on, uh, polos.

55:46.597 --> 55:48.348
Wow.

55:48.432 --> 55:52.561
I happen to be a professional
at helping men pick out polos.

55:52.644 --> 55:54.146
- What do you say?
- Nope.

55:54.229 --> 55:56.148
- No, actually, I'm all good.
- Don't be silly.

55:56.231 --> 55:59.151
Everybody needs a second
opinion. How is the fit?

55:59.234 --> 56:01.820
Because we have lots of sizes here.

56:01.904 --> 56:03.947
Oh, you know what? It's so funny.

56:04.031 --> 56:08.660
I bought my husband a pink polo
one year for Christmas,

56:08.744 --> 56:13.081
and he about died. "Pink?" He's so macho.

56:13.373 --> 56:15.792
But guess what. It looked great on him.

56:17.544 --> 56:19.838
Brought out his eyes.

56:19.922 --> 56:22.925
He had these... these blue eyes.

56:24.593 --> 56:25.844
I bet he loved it.

56:28.722 --> 56:30.307
I bet it was his favorite shirt.

56:33.101 --> 56:34.645
He passed away a year ago.

56:36.939 --> 56:39.274
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

56:39.942 --> 56:43.028
Listen to me. Debbie Downer. I'm sorry.

56:43.111 --> 56:45.030
I didn't mean to share all that with you.

56:45.113 --> 56:48.200
I just... You're just...
You're trying to buy a polo,

56:48.283 --> 56:50.494
- for God's sake. I...
- No, no, no, no. No.

56:50.577 --> 56:53.121
No, it's okay. It's okay.

56:53.205 --> 56:56.667
I, um... I lost somebody, too.

56:56.750 --> 56:58.335
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:01.296 --> 57:03.298
- I lost my dad.
- I'm so sorry.

57:05.509 --> 57:07.094
You must miss him so much.

57:07.678 --> 57:09.805
Yeah, I do.

57:09.888 --> 57:14.685
Nothing prepares you
for this stuff, right?

57:14.768 --> 57:18.105
I mean, we're all just left here...

57:19.398 --> 57:22.651
...to pick up the pieces and...

57:22.734 --> 57:26.238
My oldest, she shut down.
She retreated into work.

57:26.321 --> 57:30.868
And my other daughter, Millie,
she's so quiet now.

57:32.077 --> 57:34.997
I can't figure out
what's going on inside her head.

57:35.455 --> 57:38.959
Maybe she just needs some... some space.

57:42.296 --> 57:44.047
Just some time to figure out who she is.

57:44.923 --> 57:46.175
Yeah.

57:47.801 --> 57:49.928
I guess I do smother her.

57:50.012 --> 57:54.892
I don't mean to. But I am scared.

57:55.726 --> 57:56.894
She'll be graduating high school

57:57.019 --> 58:00.772
and running off to college,
and then I'll be left here.

58:05.402 --> 58:06.445
All by myself.

58:08.322 --> 58:09.698
But that-that's never gonna happen.

58:11.658 --> 58:13.911
She's your daughter, and...

58:16.038 --> 58:17.164
...she loves you.

58:19.958 --> 58:21.251
Thank you for that.

58:21.710 --> 58:24.880
- You're so easy to talk to.
- Yeah, you're great. You're just...

58:25.422 --> 58:28.967
Your voice, it's so... comforting

58:29.051 --> 58:31.929
and... very manly.

58:33.555 --> 58:36.058
I know this is awkward, uh, but...

58:37.226 --> 58:38.769
I've had such a good time talking to you.

58:38.852 --> 58:40.395
- Yeah, it's been...
- We hardly know each other.

58:40.479 --> 58:41.647
- I know, I know.
- Yeah.

58:41.730 --> 58:43.607
And I, I haven't even seen you yet

58:43.690 --> 58:47.110
but I think we have a connection, and...

58:47.194 --> 58:50.113
I would like to know
if maybe you would like to

58:50.197 --> 58:51.949
grab a coffee with me sometime.

58:53.659 --> 58:55.369
Ew. God, no.

58:56.703 --> 58:59.831
- No, I wouldn't, um...
- I should never have asked you.

58:59.915 --> 59:02.292
- That was totally inappropriate.
- And so what I'm saying is,

59:02.376 --> 59:04.253
you know, um, "Oh, no."

59:04.336 --> 59:06.463
Like, I've missed out
because we've had a connection.

59:06.547 --> 59:07.714
You share so beautiful.

59:07.798 --> 59:10.801
And I just would love to do
more than a coffee.

59:11.510 --> 59:14.513
Um, even, even, have a dinner?

59:14.596 --> 59:17.307
- Oh. Dinner?
- Yeah, I would love that,

59:17.391 --> 59:19.226
'cause I feel like
we know each other so well.

59:19.309 --> 59:21.436
- You know what I mean? So it's like...
- I feel that, too.

59:21.520 --> 59:24.147
A coffee wouldn't be enough
for us. But I'm married.

59:25.065 --> 59:26.984
- Oh.
- So I'm a married man.

59:27.067 --> 59:28.485
- Mom!
- What?

59:28.569 --> 59:29.736
Have you talked to Millie today?

59:29.820 --> 59:31.238
- No, I haven't.
- Okay. Where's your phone?

59:31.321 --> 59:32.573
- No, it's in my purse.
- Go get it.

59:32.656 --> 59:34.157
- Call her and make sure she's okay.
- I will!

59:34.241 --> 59:35.576
The killer was just sighted again.

59:35.659 --> 59:37.786
- Go. Let's go. Come on.
- Good luck to you!

59:45.043 --> 59:46.086
What the hell is that?

59:46.170 --> 59:48.380
Quick, put it on.
You're scary Aaron Rodgers now.

59:49.256 --> 59:50.299
- Who?
- Famous quarterback.

59:50.382 --> 59:51.967
- Green Bay Packers.
- Even I know that.

59:52.050 --> 59:53.468
You know I hate sports.

59:56.555 --> 59:58.140
This is terrifying. I can't breathe.

59:58.223 --> 1:00:00.267
It's all we had time to grab.
Your sister's on our ass.

1:00:00.350 --> 1:00:01.602
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1:00:03.312 --> 1:00:04.938
I can't see shit.

1:00:05.022 --> 1:00:07.065
How do killers do this?

1:00:07.149 --> 1:00:08.942
Nyla, drive.

1:00:09.026 --> 1:00:10.360
I'm trolling Insta.

1:00:10.444 --> 1:00:11.904
Somebody's got to know
where The Butcher is.

1:00:11.987 --> 1:00:13.530
Got it.

1:00:14.489 --> 1:00:16.200
Oh! Fuck!

1:00:20.287 --> 1:00:22.915
Oh! Sorry. Oh, that's your face. Okay.

1:00:22.998 --> 1:00:24.625
Okay, I'm getting this off.
I can't see anything.

1:00:24.708 --> 1:00:26.084
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop.

1:00:26.168 --> 1:00:28.629
If you get recognized, we are screwed.

1:00:28.712 --> 1:00:30.214
- Bingo.
- Oh, my God. What?

1:00:30.297 --> 1:00:31.590
- Suffocating. Who's this one?
- Mill.

1:00:31.673 --> 1:00:33.884
- Which one's who? Who's that?
- <i>Coming at you live,</i>

1:00:33.967 --> 1:00:37.513
<i>Blissfield's unofficial homecoming queen.</i>

1:00:41.934 --> 1:00:42.976
This sucks.

1:00:43.727 --> 1:00:45.729
- I want to party.
- We should throw our own homecoming.

1:00:45.812 --> 1:00:47.648
- Fuck The Butcher.
- Okay, sure.

1:00:47.731 --> 1:00:49.942
And where are we gonna pull that off
with Larkin's curfew?

1:00:50.609 --> 1:00:51.610
The old mill.

1:00:52.402 --> 1:00:54.154
No one would look there.

1:00:55.239 --> 1:00:57.491
- Hell yeah. That's genius.
- Not bad.

1:00:57.658 --> 1:01:01.203
Who knew little Millie Kessler
could be such a crafty beaver?

1:01:03.622 --> 1:01:06.542
Your touch makes this pussy
drier than sandpaper,

1:01:06.625 --> 1:01:08.085
you fucking monkey.

1:01:09.962 --> 1:01:11.839
I can't wait to kill you.

1:01:19.721 --> 1:01:21.056
She fucking wants me.

1:01:32.150 --> 1:01:33.986
I'm gonna take a piss.

1:01:34.069 --> 1:01:35.571
Okay. Sure.

1:01:40.826 --> 1:01:42.661
Okay, I'll go check the back.

1:01:42.744 --> 1:01:43.912
Okay.

1:01:45.873 --> 1:01:47.249
Oh, my God.

1:01:52.462 --> 1:01:53.463
- He's gonna kill him.
- What?

1:01:53.547 --> 1:01:56.550
- He's gonna kill him!
- I literally can't understand you.

1:01:56.633 --> 1:01:59.136
Here. Divide and survive. You go that way.

1:02:16.445 --> 1:02:17.863
Hey.

1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:21.283
Hey, Millie.

1:02:22.367 --> 1:02:23.785
Where'd you go?

1:02:27.539 --> 1:02:28.665
Millie?

1:02:33.962 --> 1:02:35.714
Booker?

1:02:39.176 --> 1:02:40.427
Booker?

1:02:47.684 --> 1:02:49.186
Fucking...

1:03:04.409 --> 1:03:06.578
Oh!

1:03:08.872 --> 1:03:10.207
I fucking hate this place.

1:03:33.021 --> 1:03:34.439
Hey, Millie?

1:03:36.108 --> 1:03:37.651
Hey, where are you?

1:03:40.279 --> 1:03:42.030
I just w... I just want to talk.

1:03:44.449 --> 1:03:45.659
Make sure you're okay.

1:03:54.209 --> 1:03:55.544
Booker!

1:03:59.965 --> 1:04:01.008
Oh, my God.

1:04:02.342 --> 1:04:04.428
Don't let him get away!
He'll call the cops!

1:04:05.596 --> 1:04:08.015
Help! Help! Help!

1:04:13.812 --> 1:04:14.855
Oh, my God.

1:04:20.694 --> 1:04:22.529
Where the hell did you learn
how to do that?

1:04:23.572 --> 1:04:25.032
Dad was an Eagle Scout.

1:04:26.241 --> 1:04:27.326
Found these.

1:04:29.494 --> 1:04:30.537
Ah.

1:04:35.959 --> 1:04:38.170
Uh-huh. Okay.

1:04:45.928 --> 1:04:47.804
He's even gorgeous when he's unconscious.

1:04:58.857 --> 1:05:00.192
- Hey.
- Jesus Chr...

1:05:00.275 --> 1:05:01.818
Easy, easy, easy.

1:05:01.902 --> 1:05:03.779
It's okay. It's okay.

1:05:03.862 --> 1:05:06.448
Look, I know I look like
The Butcher, but it's Millie.

1:05:07.282 --> 1:05:10.452
- This is gonna sound really strange.
- Booker.

1:05:10.536 --> 1:05:12.412
Booker, look at me. He's crazy.

1:05:12.496 --> 1:05:14.248
Okay. Booker, can you look at me, please?

1:05:14.331 --> 1:05:16.375
Please. Booker, please.
Can you look at me?

1:05:16.458 --> 1:05:17.668
Just for a second?

1:05:17.751 --> 1:05:20.796
Okay, so last night,
our consciousness or our spirit,

1:05:20.879 --> 1:05:22.422
whatever you want to call it...

1:05:22.506 --> 1:05:23.841
Okay? It traded places.

1:05:23.924 --> 1:05:26.426
- She's telling the truth.
- So, he stabbed me with the Dola,

1:05:26.510 --> 1:05:29.096
which is, like,
this ancient mystical dagger.

1:05:29.179 --> 1:05:31.390
And now I have, like, less than
six hours to swap back,

1:05:31.473 --> 1:05:33.225
or I'm gonna be stuck in his body forever.

1:05:33.308 --> 1:05:36.228
You're all going to jail for this.
You, too, Booker.

1:05:36.311 --> 1:05:38.730
Unless you help me. Booker.

1:05:38.814 --> 1:05:42.025
- Dry up, bitch.
- Booker, help! Booker!

1:05:42.109 --> 1:05:44.319
- Will you shut up?
- Booker.

1:05:44.403 --> 1:05:47.281
Look, I know this is crazy, okay?
And there's a lot of voices competing.

1:05:47.364 --> 1:05:48.991
You see my friends,
you know Nyla and Josh,

1:05:49.074 --> 1:05:50.951
and they're on my side, okay?
And this is clearly not me.

1:05:51.034 --> 1:05:52.369
Have you ever seen me dressed like that?

1:05:52.452 --> 1:05:55.122
I mean, I kind of like
a lot of what he's doing

1:05:55.205 --> 1:05:57.416
with it, but it's... The point
is that you've never seen me

1:05:57.499 --> 1:05:59.126
dressed like that, right?
Do you like that?

1:05:59.209 --> 1:06:01.461
It doesn't matter. Like, look,
I'm giving you a lot of information,

1:06:01.545 --> 1:06:02.921
and you literally just woke up.

1:06:03.922 --> 1:06:05.757
Whew. You look great.

1:06:06.758 --> 1:06:08.802
- I need to get out of here.
- Booker. Booker, please.

1:06:08.886 --> 1:06:10.637
- Please. Please, Booker.
- No, I need to go right now.

1:06:10.721 --> 1:06:12.389
You're not gonna stop me.
I'm gonna freak out, okay?

1:06:12.472 --> 1:06:13.765
"I'm not yours,

1:06:14.391 --> 1:06:15.434
"not lost in you.

1:06:16.185 --> 1:06:18.520
"Not lost, although I long to be.

1:06:20.898 --> 1:06:23.817
"Lost as a candle lit at noon.

1:06:24.610 --> 1:06:28.113
"Lost as a snowflake in the sea.

1:06:29.698 --> 1:06:32.701
"You love me, and I find you

1:06:33.702 --> 1:06:37.331
"still a spirit, beautiful and bright.

1:06:38.248 --> 1:06:39.958
"Yet I am, who long to be

1:06:41.043 --> 1:06:45.088
"lost as light is lost in light.

1:06:47.132 --> 1:06:49.718
"Plunge me deep into love.

1:06:50.302 --> 1:06:53.263
"Put away my senses.

1:06:53.347 --> 1:06:54.932
"Leave me deaf and blind,

1:06:56.391 --> 1:06:59.102
"swept by the tempest of your love...

1:07:01.730 --> 1:07:03.148
"...a taper...

1:07:05.192 --> 1:07:06.735
in the rushing wind."

1:07:08.362 --> 1:07:09.488
How?

1:07:11.198 --> 1:07:12.824
I told you it was a curse.

1:07:14.201 --> 1:07:15.285
Um...

1:07:16.036 --> 1:07:17.246
What the hell was that?

1:07:18.372 --> 1:07:21.208
A few weeks ago,
I found a poem in my locker.

1:07:23.502 --> 1:07:24.628
It was anonymous.

1:07:26.088 --> 1:07:28.465
I don't know why I did it. I just was...

1:07:30.133 --> 1:07:32.010
You know, it was...

1:07:32.886 --> 1:07:34.096
It was just stupid.

1:07:37.182 --> 1:07:38.892
You sad fucking cunt.

1:07:42.563 --> 1:07:45.065
A poem in his locker?

1:07:46.358 --> 1:07:49.778
You pathetic coward.

1:07:56.285 --> 1:08:00.664
- That's quite enough of that.
- This should be his new mug shot.

1:08:00.747 --> 1:08:02.291
Mmm.

1:08:02.374 --> 1:08:04.751
Stop messing around.

1:08:09.631 --> 1:08:11.550
So the Dola's here at the station.

1:08:11.633 --> 1:08:13.385
We're gonna have to figure out
how to steal it

1:08:13.468 --> 1:08:14.553
and then get it back here.

1:08:14.636 --> 1:08:16.095
That's, like, 40 minutes round-trip.

1:08:17.514 --> 1:08:19.725
There's plenty of time, right?

1:08:19.808 --> 1:08:21.518
Uh, that's assuming
there's someone at the station.

1:08:21.602 --> 1:08:22.685
Hmm.

1:08:22.769 --> 1:08:24.938
I mean, with them looking for us
and the party tonight,

1:08:25.022 --> 1:08:27.064
- the cops could have their hands full.
- Hmm.

1:08:27.149 --> 1:08:29.109
- Where's the party?
- It's at the old mill.

1:08:29.193 --> 1:08:31.278
That's where I woke up in this body.

1:08:31.904 --> 1:08:34.823
He's luring them there. That's a trap.

1:08:34.907 --> 1:08:37.408
- Then we better get moving.
- And what about her?

1:08:37.618 --> 1:08:39.453
- Pronouns.
- Christ, what about him?

1:08:39.703 --> 1:08:41.078
My mom's out of town until Monday.

1:08:41.162 --> 1:08:42.747
Yeah. No, I don't think it's a good idea

1:08:42.831 --> 1:08:44.457
- to leave him here alone.
- No, he's right.

1:08:44.541 --> 1:08:46.251
Someone needs to stay behind
and keep an eye on him

1:08:46.335 --> 1:08:48.295
- just in case.
- Mmm-hmm.

1:08:52.006 --> 1:08:54.176
- What? Me?
- It's your house.

1:08:54.259 --> 1:08:55.301
Definitely gonna die this time.

1:08:55.385 --> 1:08:56.886
Chill out. You'll be fine.

1:09:00.307 --> 1:09:01.767
Wait. Wait, guys.

1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:05.437
Great.

1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:07.147
Leave me alone with Murder Barbie.

1:09:17.616 --> 1:09:18.992
Okay, guys. He's gone.

1:09:20.827 --> 1:09:23.497
- That's Char's car.
- You guys stay here.

1:09:23.580 --> 1:09:25.666
Honk the horn twice
if you see anything, okay?

1:09:25.749 --> 1:09:27.792
What's your plan?

1:09:27.876 --> 1:09:29.795
Don't worry about it.

1:09:29.877 --> 1:09:31.462
I got this. Yeah.

1:09:37.511 --> 1:09:41.390
I've never been so stressed and excited
at the same time in my life.

Oh, my God. Char, help me!

1:09:54.194 --> 1:09:56.405
Nyla. What the hell is going on?

1:09:56.488 --> 1:09:57.990
You were spotted with The Butcher.

1:09:58.073 --> 1:09:59.908
He kidnapped us.
He made us drive him. I...

1:10:00.784 --> 1:10:02.703
I escaped, but he followed me here.

1:10:03.203 --> 1:10:04.746
- Wait. He's here?
- Outside, behind the station.

1:10:04.830 --> 1:10:07.332
Okay, okay. Just, just stay here, okay?

1:10:07.416 --> 1:10:08.417
- Hide under my desk.
- Okay.

1:10:08.500 --> 1:10:09.668
Go! Go, go, go!

1:10:15.132 --> 1:10:16.550
That's so crazy.

1:10:17.718 --> 1:10:21.388
But, you know, I have to admit,
in a really strange way,

1:10:21.471 --> 1:10:23.307
that it hasn't been all bad.

1:10:23.390 --> 1:10:24.725
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

1:10:24.808 --> 1:10:26.560
It's just, you know,

1:10:27.603 --> 1:10:30.063
I felt oddly empowered being in this body.

1:10:31.481 --> 1:10:33.775
Like, invincible

1:10:33.859 --> 1:10:35.903
or kind of badass.

1:10:38.071 --> 1:10:39.615
I know. It's, um...

1:10:39.698 --> 1:10:42.075
I mean, it's ridiculous, but, uh...

1:10:43.035 --> 1:10:44.912
I guess when you're, uh...

1:10:45.579 --> 1:10:48.248
When you're someone like me and you,

1:10:48.332 --> 1:10:51.752
you know, you've been bullied
most of your life

1:10:51.835 --> 1:10:55.714
and, you know, sort of
just put down a lot, that,

1:10:55.797 --> 1:10:58.967
you know, it does feel kind of good to

1:11:00.135 --> 1:11:02.137
just feel strong for once.

1:11:04.181 --> 1:11:06.016
Strength doesn't come from size.

1:11:07.059 --> 1:11:08.977
It doesn't. It comes from up here

1:11:10.020 --> 1:11:11.313
and in there.

1:11:11.396 --> 1:11:14.191
And you are a lot stronger than you think.

1:11:16.944 --> 1:11:19.738
- <i>Hello.</i>
- <i>Oh, whoa! Oh!</i>

1:11:19.821 --> 1:11:21.657
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

1:11:26.495 --> 1:11:28.997
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- <i>What happened?</i>

1:11:29.081 --> 1:11:30.499
- <i>Luann, are you okay?</i>
- <i>This one's a live one.</i>

1:11:30.582 --> 1:11:32.417
- <i>I know. Hold on.</i>
- <i>Are you okay?</i>

1:11:32.501 --> 1:11:34.711
That nasty stare does not scare me.

1:11:34.795 --> 1:11:36.213
<i>He just started
trying to buck me off.</i>

1:11:37.673 --> 1:11:39.758
<i>The Blissfield Rotary Club presents...</i>

1:11:39.842 --> 1:11:43.679
- Ha.
- ...WICKED <i>live at the Anis Theater.</i>

1:11:43.762 --> 1:11:46.640
<i>Get your tickets before they fly away.</i>

1:11:46.723 --> 1:11:48.559
<i>Ladies,
we've all been there.</i>

1:11:48.642 --> 1:11:50.727
- Just...
- <i>Can't get those corns...</i>

1:11:50.811 --> 1:11:52.312
- ...don't move.
- <i>...into that new pair of shoes?</i>

1:11:52.396 --> 1:11:54.690
<i>Well, introducing Corn Erase.</i>

1:11:54.773 --> 1:11:56.441
<i>You apply the cream all over the bunion,</i>

1:11:56.525 --> 1:11:58.485
<i>and within minutes,
the deep-penetrating...</i>

1:12:02.489 --> 1:12:04.491
Hello!

1:12:06.493 --> 1:12:07.619
Joshy!

1:12:09.872 --> 1:12:11.039
Josh.

1:12:12.291 --> 1:12:13.542
Hi, Mom.

1:12:13.625 --> 1:12:15.294
You're home early.

1:12:15.377 --> 1:12:16.920
My last flight got canceled.

1:12:17.004 --> 1:12:20.340
Honey, why is Millie
tied to my dining chair?

1:12:20.424 --> 1:12:22.467
Um, she...

1:12:24.178 --> 1:12:25.470
We, um,

1:12:26.388 --> 1:12:27.389
role-play.

1:12:28.849 --> 1:12:30.642
- Mmm?
- I'm sorry?

1:12:31.268 --> 1:12:33.437
- We're role-playing.
- Role-playing?

1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:35.230
Yes, role-playing.

1:12:35.939 --> 1:12:37.399
- Like a game?
- Sort of.

1:12:39.401 --> 1:12:41.695
She doesn't look like
she's enjoying herself.

1:12:41.778 --> 1:12:43.030
- No.
- Oh.

1:12:43.113 --> 1:12:44.948
Oh, um, that, that's the point.

1:12:45.032 --> 1:12:46.867
She's, she's supposed to act upset.

1:12:48.327 --> 1:12:49.661
Right, Millie?

1:12:50.996 --> 1:12:52.915
She's method. Never breaks character.

1:12:54.833 --> 1:12:55.834
Naughty girl!

1:12:59.421 --> 1:13:00.923
<i>He's eating my bracelet!</i>

1:13:01.006 --> 1:13:02.716
I'm a little confused.

1:13:04.092 --> 1:13:06.011
Isn't role-playing...

1:13:06.637 --> 1:13:08.347
...a sex game?

1:13:10.682 --> 1:13:11.892
- Is it?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:13:14.144 --> 1:13:15.521
Yes. Yes, it is.

1:13:15.604 --> 1:13:16.688
Mmm-hmm. Yep.

1:13:17.189 --> 1:13:18.190
So...

1:13:18.941 --> 1:13:20.108
Okay, um,

1:13:20.651 --> 1:13:24.488
Mom, I didn't want to tell you
until I was ready,

1:13:27.866 --> 1:13:28.867
but I'm straight.

1:13:33.664 --> 1:13:36.291
Joshua, you are many things,
but straight isn't one of them.

1:13:36.375 --> 1:13:38.418
Now, do me a favor and untie her.

1:13:38.502 --> 1:13:39.795
- I can't.
- Joshua!

1:13:39.878 --> 1:13:41.129
Mom, I'm sorry.

1:13:41.213 --> 1:13:43.006
I can't explain right now,
but I cannot let him go.

1:13:43.090 --> 1:13:44.258
- "Him"?
- No. Mom.

1:13:44.341 --> 1:13:45.509
Mom, Mom, Mom, listen to me.

1:13:45.592 --> 1:13:46.802
He's the Blissfield Butcher!

1:13:46.885 --> 1:13:48.929
God! Joshua Michael Detmer,

1:13:49.012 --> 1:13:51.515
I've been slinging peanuts
to assholes all week.

1:13:51.598 --> 1:13:52.599
I don't have time for this.

1:13:52.683 --> 1:13:54.017
No. Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom, don't.

1:13:54.101 --> 1:13:55.561
How did you even do this? Ow!

1:13:56.395 --> 1:13:57.521
Run!

1:14:01.775 --> 1:14:04.152
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1:14:12.369 --> 1:14:13.787
No, no, no, no, no! Go for the windows!

1:14:13.871 --> 1:14:14.872
- Make sure they're locked!
- Okay!

1:14:30.470 --> 1:14:32.472
- What?
- Nyla, he's escaped!

1:14:32.556 --> 1:14:33.557
What?

1:14:33.640 --> 1:14:35.809
Body's fucking useless!

1:14:39.813 --> 1:14:41.899
I couldn't find him.
Are you sure he followed you?

1:14:41.982 --> 1:14:43.567
Yes, I'm sure he did. I swear he...

1:14:43.650 --> 1:14:45.444
He took us, and, and...

1:14:45.527 --> 1:14:46.570
Nyla.

1:14:48.197 --> 1:14:50.949
What the fuck is going on?

1:14:53.285 --> 1:14:55.037
Don't you dare answer that.

1:14:57.331 --> 1:15:00.459
- I can explain.
- Nyla, this is serious.

1:15:01.960 --> 1:15:04.379
- Put your hands up.
- Please, just let me explain.

1:15:04.463 --> 1:15:06.256
Hands up! Now!

1:15:11.595 --> 1:15:13.305
I want you to slowly set the weapon down.

1:15:18.894 --> 1:15:19.895
Now kick it over to me.

1:15:23.607 --> 1:15:25.651
Hey, do you mind if I come back there?

1:15:27.903 --> 1:15:29.905
- Sure.
- Yeah?

1:15:33.325 --> 1:15:34.493
My God.

1:15:37.746 --> 1:15:39.498
Right. I felt so far away.

1:15:44.503 --> 1:15:46.338
- Hmm.
- So,

1:15:47.130 --> 1:15:49.383
- about that poem...
- Oh, my gosh.

1:15:49.466 --> 1:15:51.635
Please don't bring that up.
That was a total mistake.

1:15:51.718 --> 1:15:53.679
That was a mistake?

1:15:53.762 --> 1:15:54.972
What? You accidentally wrote it

1:15:55.055 --> 1:15:57.474
and you were just going by my locker,
and you tripped, and it fell in?

1:15:57.558 --> 1:15:59.518
Yes, exactly. That's what happened.

1:16:02.229 --> 1:16:04.106
Well, I thought it was beautiful.

1:16:04.189 --> 1:16:05.440
The poem.

1:16:06.441 --> 1:16:08.402
Probably read it, like, a hundred times.

1:16:08.485 --> 1:16:09.611
Really?

1:16:10.487 --> 1:16:14.157
Yeah. I mean, once I got over
how creepy it was finding it, yeah.

1:16:16.243 --> 1:16:17.828
- Sorry.
- I'm kidding.

1:16:20.247 --> 1:16:23.000
I actually kind of hoped
that it was your poem.

1:16:24.585 --> 1:16:26.044
No, you didn't.

1:16:28.797 --> 1:16:30.299
Millie,

1:16:31.466 --> 1:16:33.260
I've liked you since day one.

1:16:37.806 --> 1:16:39.474
You don't have to say that.

1:16:40.392 --> 1:16:42.603
I know I don't. That's why I did.

1:16:50.694 --> 1:16:53.655
How weird is it that I kind of feel like
kissing you right now?

1:17:05.292 --> 1:17:06.793
Technically,

1:17:07.961 --> 1:17:10.714
you'd be kissing a mass murderer
with yellow teeth.

1:17:13.050 --> 1:17:14.676
You're still Millie to me.

1:17:24.061 --> 1:17:25.521
Maybe we should wait for when my hand's

1:17:25.604 --> 1:17:27.231
- not bigger than your whole face.
- Yeah. No, no, no.

1:17:27.314 --> 1:17:29.483
That's okay. That's...
It's, it's whenever you want.

1:17:30.150 --> 1:17:31.568
I'm not going anywhere.

1:17:39.576 --> 1:17:40.786
Fuck!

1:17:42.329 --> 1:17:44.456
Millie, where the fuck have you been?

1:17:44.540 --> 1:17:46.458
- I have been calling you all day.
- What?

1:17:47.084 --> 1:17:48.544
I've been calling you, too.

1:17:48.627 --> 1:17:51.255
- That is not your sister.
- Nyla, shut the fuck up.

1:17:51.338 --> 1:17:52.339
Okay.

1:17:52.840 --> 1:17:54.299
What is going on here?

1:17:54.383 --> 1:17:55.759
Millie, stay out of this.

1:17:55.843 --> 1:17:57.845
- I'm just trying to help.
- I don't need your help, okay?

1:17:57.928 --> 1:17:59.179
- I'm just trying to help!
- I don't need your fucking help.

1:17:59.263 --> 1:18:00.347
Back the fuck up.

1:18:01.265 --> 1:18:02.266
Char!

1:18:05.435 --> 1:18:06.436
Run, Millie!

1:18:06.937 --> 1:18:08.480
Get your hands up. Hands up now!

1:18:11.149 --> 1:18:14.653
Come on, Nyla. Pick up the fucking phone!

1:18:17.823 --> 1:18:19.116
Charlene.

1:18:19.199 --> 1:18:20.826
Charlene! Charlene!

1:18:20.909 --> 1:18:22.536
Over here! Charlene!

1:18:23.245 --> 1:18:24.288
Oh, my God!

1:18:25.706 --> 1:18:27.332
Start walking towards the cell.

1:18:28.208 --> 1:18:29.293
Come on!

1:18:34.673 --> 1:18:36.633
- Can you listen to me?
- Now!

1:18:43.599 --> 1:18:45.100
Nyla, don't you fucking move!

1:18:57.863 --> 1:18:59.031
Get in.

1:18:59.114 --> 1:19:01.158
- Can you please listen to me?
- Move!

1:19:03.160 --> 1:19:04.161
Hey!

1:19:06.455 --> 1:19:07.873
- No!
- I'm so sorry.

1:19:07.956 --> 1:19:09.583
- Oh, my God! No!
- Char, I'm so sorry.

1:19:09.666 --> 1:19:10.667
No!

1:19:11.835 --> 1:19:13.962
- You motherfucker! Get me out!
- I really thought

1:19:14.046 --> 1:19:16.715
your hamster could swim,
and I'm so sorry that Regal died.

1:19:16.798 --> 1:19:19.009
But this is all gonna
make sense to you later on.

1:19:19.092 --> 1:19:20.719
I got to run. I'm so sorry.
I love you! Mwah!

1:19:20.802 --> 1:19:21.803
Guys, we gotta go!

1:19:21.887 --> 1:19:23.180
- We can't let him get away!
- Let's go, let's go!

1:19:23.263 --> 1:19:24.389
Your plan's the fucking worst.

1:19:26.183 --> 1:19:29.353
- Are you okay?
- Your sister's a shitty driver.

1:19:29.436 --> 1:19:30.854
That's not Char, that's the Butcher

1:19:30.938 --> 1:19:32.481
- and he's got the Dola.
- What?

1:19:32.564 --> 1:19:33.565
Come on, guys. Let's go!

1:19:50.123 --> 1:19:52.501
Yo-ho-ho, Millie Vanilli.

1:19:52.584 --> 1:19:54.253
Where's my boy Booker?

1:19:54.336 --> 1:19:55.921
Thought you guys were together.

1:19:56.505 --> 1:19:57.673
Okay.

1:20:04.179 --> 1:20:06.932
So, you think
you're this hot shit now, huh?

1:20:07.975 --> 1:20:11.061
You know, I've never made
anyone's pussy dry.

1:20:11.144 --> 1:20:12.145
I mean, look at me.

1:20:15.315 --> 1:20:16.567
Oh, now you like it.

1:20:18.527 --> 1:20:19.820
All right, come on.

1:20:27.286 --> 1:20:28.287
Wait, wait.

1:20:30.539 --> 1:20:31.915
Looks clear.

1:20:31.999 --> 1:20:33.000
Let's go.

1:20:33.083 --> 1:20:34.751
You guys stay here.

1:20:35.711 --> 1:20:37.045
This is way too dangerous.

1:20:37.129 --> 1:20:39.464
There is no way
we're not helping you, Mill.

1:20:39.548 --> 1:20:40.549
We're in this together.

1:20:42.342 --> 1:20:43.385
Thirteen minutes left.

1:20:44.803 --> 1:20:46.054
Or you're the Butcher forever.

1:20:47.222 --> 1:20:48.599
Hey, come here, give me your wrist.

1:20:49.266 --> 1:20:50.267
Let me set a timer.

1:20:51.268 --> 1:20:52.269
Oh, okay.

1:20:58.317 --> 1:21:00.110
Time to stab this asshole.

1:21:12.789 --> 1:21:15.083
Well, what do you know? Looks like we got

1:21:15.167 --> 1:21:16.877
a little private party going here, huh?

1:21:18.378 --> 1:21:20.464
Uh, are you good at math, Millie?

1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:23.509
'Cause the way I see it,

1:21:23.592 --> 1:21:27.679
you have three holes, and it all adds up.

1:21:40.609 --> 1:21:41.902
Will make it easier.

1:21:41.985 --> 1:21:43.195
There we go.

1:21:45.280 --> 1:21:46.323
What the fuck?

1:22:01.171 --> 1:22:04.258
What the fuck did you do to
my friends, you fucking bitch?

1:22:10.639 --> 1:22:11.682
What are you doing?

1:22:14.059 --> 1:22:15.102
Whoa, whoa, look. Hey, whoa, whoa.

1:22:16.436 --> 1:22:18.188
What are you doing? Stop. No, no, no.

1:22:19.898 --> 1:22:20.941
Don't.

1:22:21.984 --> 1:22:24.111
Please. I'm sorry.
Please, please, please, please, no.

1:22:24.194 --> 1:22:25.279
I'm sorry!

1:22:25.362 --> 1:22:26.738
Look, I'm sorry!

1:22:26.822 --> 1:22:27.906
I'm sorry! Please!

1:22:30.033 --> 1:22:31.702
Shit, it's packed.

1:22:32.828 --> 1:22:35.122
We'll search in pairs.
Text if you see him.

1:22:35.205 --> 1:22:36.957
Do not try and be a hero.

1:22:37.040 --> 1:22:39.168
- Be careful, Mill.
- You, too.

1:22:48.510 --> 1:22:49.803
Hey, hey, hey. What's up?

1:22:49.887 --> 1:22:51.638
Have you seen Millie?

1:22:51.722 --> 1:22:53.390
Uh, Millie, Millie.

1:22:53.473 --> 1:22:54.516
Millie.

1:22:54.600 --> 1:22:57.269
Oh, yeah. I, uh... I saw her.

1:22:57.352 --> 1:22:59.479
- Really? Where?
- Uh, this way.

1:22:59.563 --> 1:23:01.273
Come on. Come on.

1:23:02.399 --> 1:23:03.400
Come on.

1:23:08.071 --> 1:23:09.114
I'm not gonna make it.

1:23:09.198 --> 1:23:11.200
Hey, don't say that. There's still time.

1:23:12.910 --> 1:23:13.911
Sh...

1:23:17.581 --> 1:23:18.665
Oh, my God.

1:23:20.584 --> 1:23:22.794
Hey, hey! He's here!
He killed Brett and the others.

1:23:22.878 --> 1:23:25.172
- What? Where's Millie?
- Uh, she went to find Joshua.

1:23:28.217 --> 1:23:29.218
Oh, shit.

1:23:35.015 --> 1:23:36.016
Where is she?

1:23:37.059 --> 1:23:38.560
You said you knew where she was.

1:23:38.644 --> 1:23:40.562
She's somewhere.

1:23:42.022 --> 1:23:43.565
Millie, Millie.

1:23:44.441 --> 1:23:46.944
Millie, Millie, Millie. Millie, Millie.

1:23:50.948 --> 1:23:53.158
Phil, I don't have time for this. Where...

1:23:58.497 --> 1:23:59.581
Loser faggot.

1:23:59.665 --> 1:24:00.666
Wow!

1:24:01.166 --> 1:24:02.376
So self-aware. Bravo.

1:24:03.210 --> 1:24:04.878
You tell anybody, I'll fucking kill you.

1:24:16.431 --> 1:24:17.474
Josh!

1:24:21.687 --> 1:24:23.230
- Get out of here.
- No!

1:24:23.313 --> 1:24:25.357
- What are you doing?
- Go!

1:24:31.655 --> 1:24:33.198
I want my body back.

1:24:34.366 --> 1:24:35.534
Come and get it.

1:24:35.951 --> 1:24:37.828
Hey. Hey. We found him.

1:24:37.911 --> 1:24:39.663
- He's gonna kill Millie.
- Right, go help her.

1:24:39.746 --> 1:24:41.415
- I'll slow them down.
- Stop right there!

1:24:41.498 --> 1:24:42.583
Come on.

1:25:07.649 --> 1:25:09.109
Stop! I'm trying to stab myself!

1:25:10.068 --> 1:25:11.320
- Drop the knife!
- Shoot him!

1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:18.035
Come back with my fucking body!

1:25:38.722 --> 1:25:39.723
Catch!

1:25:41.433 --> 1:25:42.518
Hold him down.

1:25:52.611 --> 1:25:53.904
No.

1:25:59.701 --> 1:26:01.161
You're too late.

1:26:14.508 --> 1:26:15.676
Wait.

1:26:16.260 --> 1:26:18.053
- Where's the bell?
- What?

1:26:18.136 --> 1:26:21.014
The bell, uh, it didn't toll.

1:26:25.060 --> 1:26:26.103
Pro tip.

1:26:26.645 --> 1:26:28.605
Always set your watch five minutes ahead.

1:26:28.689 --> 1:26:30.315
Saves my ass, like, every time.

1:26:32.359 --> 1:26:33.527
Hold him down.

1:26:34.778 --> 1:26:37.656
No! No! No! No!

1:27:02.472 --> 1:27:03.473
Millie?

1:27:05.100 --> 1:27:06.143
Who's your favorite athlete?

1:27:06.226 --> 1:27:08.187
- They're over there!
- Hey!

1:27:09.521 --> 1:27:11.106
No one. I hate sports.

1:27:12.858 --> 1:27:13.859
Freeze!

1:27:15.152 --> 1:27:16.486
Shoot that motherfucker!

1:27:46.099 --> 1:27:49.811
Um, what the fuck just happened?

1:27:51.313 --> 1:27:52.356
That's real.

1:27:56.944 --> 1:27:58.820
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

1:28:00.155 --> 1:28:02.115
Time to land that plane, girl.

1:28:04.284 --> 1:28:05.452
Hi.

1:28:07.913 --> 1:28:09.373
How's the shoulder?

1:28:09.998 --> 1:28:12.835
Honestly, the best pain I've ever felt.

1:28:16.338 --> 1:28:19.383
So, what are you gonna tell the cops?

1:28:21.301 --> 1:28:23.303
A version of the truth, I guess.

1:28:26.807 --> 1:28:29.268
Let's just hope nobody ever gets
their hands on that thing again.

1:28:34.022 --> 1:28:35.065
What?

1:28:37.484 --> 1:28:38.944
So,

1:28:39.903 --> 1:28:42.155
that thing

1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:45.450
we were trying to do earlier.

1:28:46.118 --> 1:28:47.119
Oh.

1:28:47.202 --> 1:28:48.203
Oh!

1:28:49.371 --> 1:28:52.332
Oh, are we, are we ready
to try that again?

1:28:52.416 --> 1:28:54.084
I don't know. Let's see. Let's...

1:29:00.382 --> 1:29:02.176
- That's much better.
- Mmm.

1:29:13.270 --> 1:29:14.646
Yeah, Mill!

1:29:17.191 --> 1:29:18.400
Millie!

1:29:19.318 --> 1:29:20.569
- Mom?
- Oh.

1:29:22.613 --> 1:29:26.283
Oh, Millie, you're okay. I was so worried.

1:29:41.215 --> 1:29:42.925
His pulse and heart rate are weak.

1:29:43.675 --> 1:29:45.469
I don't think he's gonna make it.

1:29:45.552 --> 1:29:46.970
Good.

1:29:47.054 --> 1:29:48.639
How empathetic.

1:29:48.722 --> 1:29:51.642
If you'd seen the carnage,
you'd be glad, too.

1:29:55.354 --> 1:29:57.064
Looks like you got your wish.

1:30:09.493 --> 1:30:11.119
I'm tired. I'm gonna hit the sack.

1:30:11.203 --> 1:30:12.454
Good night, Char.

1:30:13.038 --> 1:30:14.081
Hey.

1:30:15.249 --> 1:30:16.375
I love you, sis.

1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:19.878
I love you, too, stinker.

1:30:22.130 --> 1:30:24.258
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, Charlene.

1:30:32.683 --> 1:30:33.851
So,

1:30:34.852 --> 1:30:37.896
that application to Boston,

1:30:40.816 --> 1:30:42.276
I want you to go.

1:30:47.823 --> 1:30:49.700
It's okay. I don't need to go.

1:30:50.576 --> 1:30:51.869
You're my daughter.

1:30:52.536 --> 1:30:53.829
Nothing will ever change that.

1:30:55.956 --> 1:30:57.708
Live your life, Millie.

1:31:00.919 --> 1:31:02.045
Thanks, Mom.

1:31:45.589 --> 1:31:46.757
Char!

1:31:47.299 --> 1:31:49.176
You left the door open again.

1:31:54.181 --> 1:31:55.182
Char?

1:32:04.191 --> 1:32:05.192
Hello?

1:33:21.185 --> 1:33:22.895
What's the matter, Millie?

1:33:24.062 --> 1:33:25.814
You got what you wanted, right?

1:33:26.732 --> 1:33:28.567
You got your body back.

1:33:29.776 --> 1:33:30.986
Why aren't you happy?

1:33:31.653 --> 1:33:32.905
Freeze!

1:33:37.367 --> 1:33:38.869
Little girls shouldn't play with guns.

1:33:45.292 --> 1:33:46.418
Run, Millie! Run!

1:34:15.072 --> 1:34:16.323
Well, don't stop.

1:34:17.658 --> 1:34:18.700
Keep coming.

1:34:24.748 --> 1:34:26.333
I've been in your body.

1:34:27.167 --> 1:34:29.336
I understand why you feel so weak.

1:34:29.711 --> 1:34:30.963
Why you feel so meager.

1:34:31.755 --> 1:34:33.966
And all that anxiety that you got.

1:34:36.051 --> 1:34:37.344
Clinging to your dead dad.

1:34:38.303 --> 1:34:40.556
You're really just
a lesser version of her.

1:34:41.223 --> 1:34:43.934
And having to take all those orders
from some drunk mom.

1:34:44.017 --> 1:34:45.894
Ah! God! Ah!

1:34:49.022 --> 1:34:50.315
That's not a life.

1:34:51.149 --> 1:34:52.150
But it's all right.

1:34:53.986 --> 1:34:55.279
It's okay.

1:34:56.071 --> 1:34:57.197
We'll fix it.

1:35:05.205 --> 1:35:06.623
You know...

1:35:11.461 --> 1:35:13.589
I learned something
when I was in your body, too.

1:35:13.672 --> 1:35:14.798
What's that?

1:35:17.467 --> 1:35:18.802
Having balls sucks.

1:35:20.888 --> 1:35:22.014
Take my hand!

1:35:24.057 --> 1:35:25.100
Millie!

1:35:49.374 --> 1:35:50.375
Damn, Mill.

1:35:58.008 --> 1:36:00.135
I am a fucking piece.
