WEBVTT

00:13.680 --> 00:15.045
MITCHELL: They canceled it? Really?

00:15.148 --> 00:18.140
I didn't even know
the new season had started.

00:18.551 --> 00:20.712
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

00:20.820 --> 00:22.048
Yes, sir.

00:22.555 --> 00:23.522
(GROANS)

00:29.229 --> 00:30.924
It's a nice outfit.

00:32.265 --> 00:34.699
- It's very...
- Civilian?

00:35.735 --> 00:38.397
Well, yeah, that's one way of putting it.

00:38.505 --> 00:40.939
So, what is this, girl's day out?

00:41.041 --> 00:43.703
Well, yes, if I'm gonna integrate
into Earth society,

00:43.810 --> 00:45.539
we thought it was very important
that I immerse myself

00:45.645 --> 00:47.840
in the local cultural offerings.

00:47.947 --> 00:50.472
And by "cultural offerings," you mean...

00:50.583 --> 00:53.484
Pedicures, mochaccinos
and Victoria's Secret.

00:55.622 --> 00:57.590
Well, we're scheduled to go offworld
in about an hour,

00:57.690 --> 01:00.682
and, though you both look fantastic,

01:00.794 --> 01:03.354
I suggest you might want
to lose the heels.

01:03.463 --> 01:05.761
<i>HARRIMAN ON PA: Unscheduled</i>
<i>offworld activation.</i>

01:05.865 --> 01:07.298
Ladies first.

01:11.271 --> 01:13.330
Sir, we're receiving a video transmission.

01:13.440 --> 01:14.873
Let's see it.

01:15.675 --> 01:20.669
<i>Hello? Hello? Is this thing working?</i>

01:20.780 --> 01:23.180
This is General Landry
of Stargate Command.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.808
<i>General! It is a pleasure.</i>

01:25.919 --> 01:27.910
<i>I don't get out to your end</i>
<i>of the galaxy much,</i>

01:28.021 --> 01:32.219
<i>but I have a friend who lives in the area</i>
<i>and he speaks very highly of your people.</i>

01:32.325 --> 01:35.886
<i>Maybe know him? A funny little guy</i>
<i>with a beard, lives on a planet</i>

01:35.995 --> 01:38.623
<i>formerly occupied</i>
<i>by a female System Lord.</i>

01:38.731 --> 01:41.564
- I don't...
<i>- Rovak?</i>

01:41.668 --> 01:44.102
<i>Robak? Does the name sound familiar?</i>

01:44.204 --> 01:46.570
No, it doesn't. Now, what's this about?

01:46.673 --> 01:48.834
<i>Sir, I have some information for you,</i>

01:48.942 --> 01:53.208
<i>information that could impact</i>
<i>the very survival of your world.</i>

01:53.313 --> 01:54.439
Jasec?

01:55.348 --> 01:56.975
You know this man?

01:57.650 --> 02:00.847
A little. He's my father.

02:03.890 --> 02:04.857
(SIGHS)

03:09.589 --> 03:11.853
<i>Vala! Is that you?</i>

03:11.958 --> 03:13.084
Yes, it is.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.559
<i>Sweetheart, how is life treating you?</i>

03:15.662 --> 03:17.357
Certainly better than you ever did.

03:17.463 --> 03:20.864
<i>Ouch. I suppose, for the benefit</i>
<i>of your friends there,</i>

03:20.967 --> 03:24.630
<i>you're going to want to list all the reasons</i>
<i>why I was such a bad father.</i>

03:24.737 --> 03:28.571
I wish I could, but a wormhole
can only be maintained for 38 minutes.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.871
<i>You've got your father's wit.</i>

03:30.977 --> 03:33.411
It's hardly enough time to cover
your inadequacies as both a parent

03:33.513 --> 03:35.003
and a human being in general.

03:35.114 --> 03:38.311
<i>And your mother's uncanny ability</i>
<i>to hold a grudge.</i>

03:38.418 --> 03:41.353
You said you had some information for us?

03:41.888 --> 03:44.584
<i>Yes. Let me through, and we'll discuss.</i>

03:45.425 --> 03:47.825
All right. Provided Vala will vouch for you.

03:47.927 --> 03:50.020
I most certainly will not.

03:50.129 --> 03:51.960
<i>You'll want to hear this.</i>

03:52.065 --> 03:56.900
<i>The information I have has to do</i>
<i>with Arkad's plot to attack your planet.</i>

03:57.370 --> 03:58.997
Arkad is dead.

03:59.105 --> 04:03.769
<i>Well, he may be dead,</i>
<i>but the threat he set in motion still exists.</i>

04:05.511 --> 04:07.843
<i>Take your time. There's no pressure.</i>

04:07.947 --> 04:11.576
<i>Just that your whole planet</i>
<i>could very well blow up at any moment.</i>

04:13.620 --> 04:15.053
HARRIMAN: Chevron six encoded.

04:15.154 --> 04:16.519
MITCHELL: So, what's the deal
with the accent?

04:16.623 --> 04:18.716
Or, in your father's case, the lack thereof?

04:18.825 --> 04:21.817
Well, the accent, like most of my other
good qualities, I got from my mother,

04:21.928 --> 04:23.452
my charm, my wit, my good looks.

04:23.563 --> 04:26.657
- What'd you get from your dad?
- Some minor food allergies.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.290
HARRIMAN: Chevron seven locked.

04:43.283 --> 04:47.219
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- JASEC: Of course you do.

04:48.488 --> 04:52.083
That's because I raised you
to be cautious, wary.

04:52.191 --> 04:55.388
- Mother raised me.
- Which one?

04:57.330 --> 04:58.524
My mother.

04:58.631 --> 05:02.123
Right. Hug for Daddy?

05:02.502 --> 05:04.129
You're lucky I'm not allowed to kill you.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.967
Well, so much for happy family reunions.

05:07.073 --> 05:10.042
What do you know about Arkad
and the attacks he was planning?

05:10.143 --> 05:12.873
Quite a lot. And I'm prepared
to tell you everything I know

05:12.979 --> 05:15.573
in exchange for sanctuary on Earth.

05:15.682 --> 05:16.944
There's the angle.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.315
Okay, I was a terrible husband
and, admittedly,

05:20.420 --> 05:24.322
probably not the best father figure,
although I've seen worse.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.858
But I've put all that behind me
because I'm trying to change,

05:26.959 --> 05:31.396
trying to better myself,
which is why I'm here now, risking my life,

05:31.497 --> 05:34.022
to tell you that before Arkad died

05:34.133 --> 05:37.625
he sent out several
naquadah-loaded cargo ships

05:37.737 --> 05:40.467
in preparation for an attack on Earth.

05:41.407 --> 05:48.108
And those cargo ships, my friends,
are still out there, waiting to be launched,

05:48.214 --> 05:51.047
and I know their location.

05:56.456 --> 05:57.684
Can't you see what he's doing?

05:57.790 --> 06:00.691
He's spent an entire lifetime
taking advantage of people,

06:00.793 --> 06:02.761
and now that they're finally
catching up with him,

06:02.862 --> 06:05.660
he thinks he can use us
to hide from his enemies.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.528
But that's not really the issue here.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.863
No, Sam's right.
If Jasec is telling the truth

06:09.969 --> 06:12.130
and there's still a bunch of
naquadah-loaded cargo ships out there,

06:12.238 --> 06:13.364
then this deal is a no-brainer.

06:13.473 --> 06:15.065
If he is telling the truth.

06:15.174 --> 06:19.110
Thus far, the Jaffa have been unable
to corroborate any part of his story.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.409
Well, they wouldn't, if Arkad
was careful enough to cover his tracks.

06:22.515 --> 06:25.541
If the threat is real, we can't let
any of those cargo ships blow up.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.516
Time is of the essence.

06:28.788 --> 06:32.087
Well, there is one way to find out
if he's being straight with us.

06:32.191 --> 06:34.091
All right, check it out.

06:34.193 --> 06:37.685
If his intel is good,
then Jasec has himself a deal.

06:45.705 --> 06:46.933
Dr. Lam?

06:48.474 --> 06:49.771
As you were, Sergeant.

06:49.876 --> 06:51.173
Excuse me.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.946
Carolyn, I've been thinking...

06:58.050 --> 07:01.042
See, now, whenever you preface
what you're about to say

07:01.154 --> 07:03.987
with "I've been thinking,"
what you're actually doing is preparing me

07:04.090 --> 07:08.254
for some revelation you've just had,
so should I be sitting down for this?

07:08.361 --> 07:11.330
It's been a while
since I last spoke to your mother.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.958
- Yeah, a little over five years.
- We were married for 12.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.427
What brought this on all of a sudden?

07:17.537 --> 07:20.734
Well, I've been thinking about it
ever since you came to work here,

07:20.840 --> 07:23.206
about reaching out to your mother,

07:23.309 --> 07:26.642
at least opening up
some kind of communication with her.

07:27.947 --> 07:32.213
Okay. So, how do you want to do this?

07:32.318 --> 07:34.786
Well, I was thinking about
giving her a call.

07:34.887 --> 07:37.515
- Just like that? Just out of the blue?
- No.

07:38.591 --> 07:41.219
She's in Europe for a couple of weeks,

07:41.327 --> 07:46.162
so when she gets back, why don't I call her
and put in a good word for you?

07:47.033 --> 07:48.091
Thank you.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.125
You're welcome.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.550
We've come all this way for nothing.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.492
The cargo ships won't be there, my father
will have played you all for fools,

08:16.596 --> 08:18.291
and this will have been
a giant waste of time.

08:18.397 --> 08:21.833
Not entirely. If the ships aren't there,
we'll have called his bluff,

08:21.934 --> 08:24.198
and you can tell us
that you were right all along.

08:24.303 --> 08:26.032
You bet I will.

08:36.048 --> 08:38.881
Entering high orbit. Scanning.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.683
What've we got?

08:40.786 --> 08:43.516
We're picking up only 12 life signs
on the planet's surface.

08:43.623 --> 08:44.749
That's it?

08:44.857 --> 08:47.519
We're also picking up a significant
concentration of naquadah.

08:47.627 --> 08:49.151
These readings are through the roof.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.923
Looks like the intel is good.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.058
MARKS: Sir, we're picking up movement.

08:53.165 --> 08:55.429
We've been detected.
They're making a break for it.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.469
Those ships must not be allowed
to escape.

08:57.570 --> 09:00.334
- Lock onto their position and fire.
- Yes, sir.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.738
Missiles are tracking.
Impact in five seconds.

09:08.581 --> 09:13.746
Four, three, two, one, impact.

09:14.253 --> 09:16.118
(EXPLOSION)

09:17.823 --> 09:22.123
Sir? I'm reading a massive
secondary explosion.

09:24.764 --> 09:27.130
How much naquadah was down there?

09:29.602 --> 09:31.570
VALA: General,
you're making a terrible mistake,

09:31.671 --> 09:35.072
but with all due respect,
it's not too late to change your mind.

09:35.174 --> 09:37.665
I made a deal.
I'm not going back on my word.

09:37.777 --> 09:40.644
Then might I suggest a more liberal
interpretation of the agreement?

09:40.746 --> 09:42.611
For instance, the word "sanctuary"
could mean anything

09:42.715 --> 09:44.979
from accommodations
in an idyllic tropical setting,

09:45.084 --> 09:46.847
to, say, a lifetime's incarceration

09:46.953 --> 09:49.285
in one of these planets'
more unpleasant penal facilities.

09:49.388 --> 09:50.719
Forget it.

10:05.805 --> 10:08.239
Okay, I'll go back for
the rest of my stuff later.

10:08.341 --> 10:12.801
I tell you, travel is becoming more
and more difficult every day.

10:14.413 --> 10:17.940
I'm General Landry.
Jasec, welcome to Earth.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.216
A fresh start on a brand new world.

10:22.321 --> 10:25.654
I have a feeling
I'm going to like it here very much.

10:26.325 --> 10:27.383
Vala.

10:30.329 --> 10:31.591
(SIGHS)

10:36.602 --> 10:38.331
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

10:38.771 --> 10:39.965
Come in.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.304
General.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.847
This came for you today.

10:48.948 --> 10:52.213
Since when did you assume
mail delivery duties at the base?

10:52.318 --> 10:55.344
- It's from your father.
- Oh.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.927
I'll just file that away for later.

11:04.430 --> 11:07.024
It's been three weeks
since he came to Earth,

11:07.133 --> 11:10.466
and you've ignored every attempt
he's made to get in touch with you.

11:10.569 --> 11:13.766
Well, I've been terribly busy.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.539
I think family should always come first.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.340
I learned that the hard way.

11:24.316 --> 11:25.510
How?

11:25.618 --> 11:28.815
Were you absent for the first three years
of your daughter's life

11:28.921 --> 11:31.822
because you were too busy running scams
out of the Nylus sector?

11:31.924 --> 11:36.623
No, but I did allow my career
to take precedent over the things

11:36.729 --> 11:42.065
that should have been more important
to me, birthdays, anniversaries,

11:43.469 --> 11:45.767
my daughter's graduation.

11:47.506 --> 11:50.998
No offense, General,
but there really is no comparison.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.805
You had a legitimate occupation.

11:52.912 --> 11:57.110
My father's career choice
was decidedly less noble.

11:57.983 --> 12:00.383
He'd be gone for months at a time,

12:00.486 --> 12:04.183
only to return to lay low or to hide
from the people he had swindled.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.383
What were things like
when he was at home?

12:13.065 --> 12:16.000
Well, I actually looked forward
to the times

12:16.102 --> 12:18.127
that he would grace us with his presence.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.603
I was young and he was my father.

12:22.208 --> 12:25.735
Sometimes he'd return late
in the middle of the night,

12:25.845 --> 12:29.406
and I would wake to find him asleep
at the foot of my bed.

12:31.450 --> 12:33.315
I was so excited
I couldn't wait until morning,

12:33.419 --> 12:38.721
and I would prod him awake and make him
tell me all about his great adventures.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.991
He'd always have something for me, too,
a fancy ring, a pretty necklace,

12:44.096 --> 12:46.462
things that he'd bring back
from his many travels.

12:46.565 --> 12:48.624
I treasured those keepsakes,

12:50.069 --> 12:53.505
memories of my father
that I kept stored away under my bed,

12:53.606 --> 12:57.337
until I was old enough
to see them for what they really were,

12:57.443 --> 13:00.810
worthless trinkets
meant to curry my favor.

13:02.214 --> 13:04.774
He might feel differently about that.

13:06.552 --> 13:07.883
You don't know him.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.881
No. I don't.

13:14.360 --> 13:19.593
But I do know that he spent every day
of the last three weeks

13:19.698 --> 13:22.132
trying to get in touch with you,

13:22.234 --> 13:25.670
which tells me that you must be
very important to him,

13:26.238 --> 13:29.571
possibly much more than you know.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.941
You have some good memories
of the times you spent together

13:40.052 --> 13:42.145
when you were a little girl.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.322
Those times count, too.

13:58.137 --> 14:02.233
Colonel Mitchell. Dr. Jackson.
Thanks for <i>coming. Entrez.</i>

14:03.609 --> 14:06.442
- We interrupting something?
- No, we're just enjoying a quiet little...

14:06.545 --> 14:09.013
- B 10!
- Bingo!

14:09.114 --> 14:10.376
WOMAN: B 10.

14:10.482 --> 14:14.543
All right, ladies. We've got to call it a day.
Come on.

14:15.454 --> 14:18.787
Pay the winner. Read them and weep.

14:19.925 --> 14:21.620
All fair and square.

14:21.727 --> 14:22.853
Every Tuesday and Thursday,

14:22.962 --> 14:25.658
I host a little bingo afternoon
for some of the seniors in the building.

14:25.764 --> 14:30.531
Gets them out of their apartments.
Thank you. No running in the hall.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.501
You know, it gives them
a chance to socialize.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.836
It's good for them.
No loud parties after midnight.

14:36.275 --> 14:38.709
Bless their decrepit little hearts. That's it.

14:38.811 --> 14:41.780
Be careful.
A lot of cross-traffic in the halls today.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.679
Whoa, whoa, Hazel. You're a little light.

14:45.818 --> 14:49.083
Money confuses her when it's going out.

14:50.856 --> 14:53.825
See you next time. Same time, Thursday.

14:53.926 --> 14:57.225
And to make up for today,
I'm waiving the cover charge.

14:57.329 --> 15:00.025
Yeah, settling in quite nicely, thanks.

15:00.599 --> 15:04.262
Yeah, we heard you haven't exactly
been a model citizen.

15:04.837 --> 15:08.500
- I'm not sure what you're referring to.
- The charity phone scam.

15:08.607 --> 15:11.770
- Little Pepito needs a new set of kidneys...
- Right.

15:11.877 --> 15:15.711
Well, see, the Air Force provides me
with a mere pittance.

15:15.814 --> 15:19.750
It's hardly enough to live on.
I'm just looking to supplement my income.

15:20.686 --> 15:25.248
Okay, there've been a few lapses
in judgment, but darn it, I'm working on it,

15:25.357 --> 15:28.292
and I just wish Vala could see that.

15:28.394 --> 15:30.760
That's where you guys come in.

15:30.863 --> 15:33.058
Yeah, we figured that's why
you asked us over.

15:33.165 --> 15:35.861
Well, you're her friends. She trusts you.

15:35.968 --> 15:38.630
You want us to talk to her for you?

15:38.737 --> 15:41.103
Well, I was going to suggest tricking her
into coming here,

15:41.206 --> 15:44.004
but if you really think talking will work...

15:47.713 --> 15:50.876
Please, guys.
I really need to see my little girl.

15:52.751 --> 15:57.518
If it's a matter of expenses, we can talk
about that later, if you get my drift.

15:58.057 --> 16:01.356
We're not putting anything on paper,
of course, but give it some thought.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.688
I appreciate it.

16:05.664 --> 16:10.966
Good news. I got a call from Mom, and
she'll be in Colorado Springs on Friday.

16:11.670 --> 16:12.659
She will?

16:12.771 --> 16:16.798
Yes, she's passing through,
and she's agreed to have dinner with you.

16:16.909 --> 16:17.898
She has?

16:18.010 --> 16:20.478
Well, so long as I come along, yeah.

16:22.915 --> 16:26.874
- Okay, I thought you'd be thrilled.
- No, I am. No, that's...

16:27.753 --> 16:29.311
No, it's great news.

16:29.421 --> 16:35.053
Okay. So I'll make a dinner reservation
for Friday night, somewhere nice?

16:35.294 --> 16:37.319
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

16:39.431 --> 16:41.524
And you know that brown sports jacket

16:41.633 --> 16:44.158
that you have with the patches
on the sleeves?

16:44.269 --> 16:45.861
Don't wear that.

16:54.313 --> 16:57.407
- Where have you been?
- Your father's place.

16:57.516 --> 17:02.078
So, he wanted you to talk to me
on his behalf, didn't he?

17:02.187 --> 17:04.553
- Yeah. Look, he really wants to...
- You needn't bother.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.647
Look, you two obviously
have some unresolved issues.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.455
I've already decided to pay him a visit.

17:12.264 --> 17:13.253
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

17:13.365 --> 17:14.525
Coming.

17:18.904 --> 17:20.428
Oh, no.

17:23.642 --> 17:24.631
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

17:24.743 --> 17:26.472
I'm coming.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.048
Well, this is a surprise.

17:31.150 --> 17:36.486
I have not come seeking reconciliation
or some deeper understanding

17:36.588 --> 17:38.818
of your contemptible behavior
in my formative years.

17:38.924 --> 17:41.154
I have come for one thing
and one thing only.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.888
Well, if it's chicken casserole,
you're in luck because I just...

17:43.996 --> 17:46.464
Catharsis. To that end.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.199
(SIGHS)

17:48.767 --> 17:52.498
How dare you implicate yourself in my life
after all these years?

17:52.604 --> 17:53.866
You were never there for Mother,

17:53.972 --> 17:56.406
even though you always expected us
to be there for you

17:56.508 --> 17:58.533
whenever you needed a place to hide,

17:58.644 --> 18:01.511
or capital to help set up
one of your latest scams.

18:01.613 --> 18:04.275
My life has been a constant struggle

18:04.383 --> 18:06.749
against the personal issues
that you seeded.

18:06.852 --> 18:10.379
And now that I am at Stargate Command,
and I am finally happy with who I am,

18:10.489 --> 18:12.514
you think you can come along
and jeopardize everything

18:12.624 --> 18:13.092
I've worked so hard to achieve.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.354
I've worked so hard to achieve.

18:14.460 --> 18:18.362
Under no circumstances
will I allow you to screw that up for me.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.833
Wow. Did you rehearse that?

18:24.403 --> 18:25.370
A little.

18:29.441 --> 18:34.344
- Right. I'm done.
- That's it? You're gonna leave?

18:34.446 --> 18:36.141
But I made pie.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.842
Well, I've said everything I needed to say.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.613
But if it was just a matter of getting
all that off your chest,

18:41.720 --> 18:44.211
you could have just as easily
sent me a letter,

18:44.323 --> 18:47.121
but you went to the effort to come see me.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.927
Coming here was only to please
my friends at Stargate Command

18:52.030 --> 18:55.193
and stop them from giving me
any more unsolicited advice.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.235
Yes, it must be wonderful to have friends
who care about you,

18:58.337 --> 19:01.864
who support you in times of need,
who believe in you.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.737
I earned their trust.

19:04.243 --> 19:08.304
At least you had the opportunity.
You won't even give me that.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.171
You don't deserve it.

19:12.351 --> 19:14.615
I don't suppose there's anything
I could say or do

19:14.720 --> 19:19.453
that would convince you that I'm not lying,
that I'm honestly trying to change.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.591
No, there isn't.

19:26.398 --> 19:31.461
Well, then, before you go, this is for you.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.002
I got it from a trader on Meronat.

19:34.106 --> 19:37.075
You know, that little world
with the twin suns

19:37.176 --> 19:39.007
I used to take you to.

19:39.711 --> 19:43.647
- I remember Meronat.
- Do you still have your little treasure box?

19:43.749 --> 19:45.649
Where you would store all the gifts
I used to bring you

19:45.751 --> 19:48.117
when you were just a little girl?

19:48.587 --> 19:52.353
No. I threw that away a long time ago.

19:53.392 --> 19:57.556
I understand. Well, thanks for coming.

19:58.764 --> 20:03.758
And even though it's too late,
I want you to know I'm sorry.

20:13.178 --> 20:15.646
- Having second thoughts?
- No.

20:16.215 --> 20:21.482
- I think the door is locked.
- It sticks a little.

20:24.256 --> 20:27.157
- There you go.
- Goodbye, Jasec.

20:27.926 --> 20:32.386
For once in the last 20 years,
could you call me Dad?

20:33.699 --> 20:36.099
You haven't earned that right yet.

20:40.005 --> 20:41.029
Yet.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.365
I'll be in touch.

20:51.950 --> 20:55.750
Vala. I think you're gonna wanna see this.

21:03.028 --> 21:05.189
I found this on the Internet.

21:06.365 --> 21:08.333
<i>It's time to tap into the source</i>

21:08.433 --> 21:10.901
<i>by unlocking the power of stardust.</i>

21:13.138 --> 21:15.368
<i>Yes, genuine stardust!</i>

21:15.474 --> 21:19.467
<i>The very same stardust</i>
<i>celebrities and professional athletes use</i>

21:19.578 --> 21:22.638
<i>to tap into the power of the alpha force,</i>

21:22.748 --> 21:24.648
<i>the core energy of the universe.</i>

21:24.750 --> 21:26.183
<i>Tap into the source.</i>

21:26.285 --> 21:31.416
<i>Each specially treated vial contains</i>
<i>four full grams of authentic stardust</i>

21:31.523 --> 21:33.889
<i>for only $19.95!</i>

21:33.992 --> 21:39.953
<i>That's only $19.95</i>
<i>for a vial of genuine stardust.</i>

21:41.400 --> 21:42.731
<i>Tap into the source.</i>

21:49.908 --> 21:51.842
It wasn't real stardust.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.173
That's the point. You're running a scam.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.180
Well, now,
that's a matter of interpretation.

21:57.282 --> 22:00.877
The way I see it, I'm selling people hope.

22:00.986 --> 22:04.922
No. You're selling glitter shavings
in a tube for 20 bucks a pop.

22:05.023 --> 22:07.082
Plus shipping and handling.

22:07.959 --> 22:14.694
Look, you are a guest on this planet,
and as long as you are a guest,

22:15.934 --> 22:18.129
you're gonna follow some rules.

22:18.236 --> 22:21.399
Come on, a guy's got to make a living.

22:22.474 --> 22:26.410
The next thing you know, you're going
to tell me I can't publish my diet book.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.844
It's an "Eat For Your Eye Color" diet.
I just lined up a publisher.

22:29.948 --> 22:31.973
We're killing the book deal,
and if you keep this up,

22:32.084 --> 22:35.110
the next deal we kill
is going to be the one with you.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.051
Fine, no more scams.

22:37.155 --> 22:39.953
Teal'c is waiting to escort you out.

22:40.425 --> 22:41.790
Yes, I...

22:42.627 --> 22:44.925
I appreciate this second chance.

22:45.330 --> 22:46.661
Third chance.

22:46.765 --> 22:49.165
Are you sure? I could've sworn it was...

22:49.267 --> 22:51.132
Right. Pepito.

22:53.839 --> 22:59.368
Come this way. Do you play poker?
Are you familiar with the game 21?

23:04.182 --> 23:07.447
- May I offer you a word of advice?
- Hello. Hi.

23:07.552 --> 23:11.579
Any input that would help me better
myself would be greatly appreciated.

23:11.690 --> 23:14.887
Perhaps three words. Be less annoying.

23:16.795 --> 23:19.093
And if you have no intention
of reforming your ways,

23:19.197 --> 23:21.131
which I suspect that you do not,

23:21.233 --> 23:23.861
perhaps it is best that you have nothing
more to do with your daughter.

23:23.969 --> 23:26.870
Let me tell you something, big boy,
my daughter and I have an understanding,

23:26.972 --> 23:28.997
an unspoken bond that...

23:29.508 --> 23:31.203
She'll get over it.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.674
Vala! Are you free on Friday night?

23:34.780 --> 23:38.307
Say yes, I got two tickets to this
"Virginia Dialogues" show.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.818
I don't know much about it,
but the tickets are very hard to get.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.252
To think I was just starting
to believe in you.

23:44.356 --> 23:47.757
I'm trying to change.
It's an ongoing process.

23:48.860 --> 23:49.986
(EX CLAIMS)

23:52.898 --> 23:53.865
(SIGHS)

23:54.800 --> 23:57.268
So, what are you doing Friday night?

24:03.375 --> 24:06.936
- That's the last of them.
- Thank you. Vala?

24:08.146 --> 24:09.875
Have a seat, please?

24:15.587 --> 24:17.851
- How're you doing?
- Fine.

24:18.857 --> 24:22.486
- Why wouldn't I be?
- Well, you're obviously disappointed.

24:23.395 --> 24:27.354
Right, yeah. No, not in Jasec.
His actions didn't really surprise me.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.991
More in myself
for even considering the possibility

24:30.101 --> 24:32.092
that he might be telling the truth.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.001
- Maybe he was.
- No, he lied.

24:34.105 --> 24:36.403
He said he was trying to change.

24:36.508 --> 24:39.238
Well, change isn't easy.
I think you of all people should know that.

24:39.344 --> 24:42.245
Right, so you want to draw parallels
between him and I,

24:42.347 --> 24:47.478
our equally disreputable pasts,
our similar desires to reform.

24:47.953 --> 24:49.716
Yeah, there's that.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.982
Daniel, I'm a different person
than I was two years ago

24:52.090 --> 24:54.684
because I genuinely wanted to change.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.554
I didn't see it as a means of escape.

24:57.896 --> 24:59.830
No? So, you're telling me
your decision had nothing to do

24:59.931 --> 25:03.628
with the desire to stop running
and live a semi-normal life?

25:05.971 --> 25:08.838
- You don't know Jasec the way I do.
- No, you're right.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.841
In fact, you probably know him
better than you think.

25:11.943 --> 25:14.571
After all, you, better than anybody,
must know what it's like

25:14.679 --> 25:18.740
to have to resist the temptation
of falling back on your old ways.

25:21.152 --> 25:24.087
I'm sure it hasn't been easy for you, either.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.388
Jasec, it's Vala.

25:32.931 --> 25:34.694
Should we come back?

25:35.033 --> 25:36.295
No.

25:38.103 --> 25:39.502
Excuse me.

25:47.679 --> 25:48.907
Too easy.

25:49.781 --> 25:51.043
Jasec?

25:55.387 --> 25:56.445
Dad?

26:00.926 --> 26:03.156
Hello? He's not in here.

26:04.429 --> 26:05.726
I knew it.

26:07.933 --> 26:09.594
He's removed his ankle monitor.

26:09.701 --> 26:12.135
I told you he's been playing you
for fools all along.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.898
Actually, you were starting
to believe him, too.

26:14.005 --> 26:16.235
If he's decided to leave,
it's unlikely we'll find him again.

26:16.341 --> 26:17.740
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

26:17.842 --> 26:18.831
During his initial physical,

26:18.944 --> 26:21.469
Dr. Lam implanted him
with a subcutaneous transmitter.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.047
Just in case.

26:27.385 --> 26:30.479
You didn't trust him, but you talked me
into coming here anyway?

26:30.589 --> 26:33.149
Hey, he's not my father. Sam, it's Daniel.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.466
- What's going on?
- Jasec's on the run.

26:43.568 --> 26:45.968
His locator signal places him
approximately six miles

26:46.071 --> 26:47.504
west of Colorado Springs.

26:47.606 --> 26:51.940
- Have we dispatched a team to the area?
- Yeah, Daniel and Vala just got there.

26:52.043 --> 26:53.032
Daniel?

26:54.112 --> 26:56.910
We've parked
and we're proceeding on foot.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.348
You're headed right for him.

27:11.463 --> 27:15.092
One, let's start over again.
There's seven total.

27:15.200 --> 27:19.728
Three for you, three for me, one for me,
it's for the house, as we call it.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.669
I didn't know your father had any friends
here on Earth.

27:21.773 --> 27:23.035
Neither did I.

27:23.141 --> 27:26.941
You can't go back on this deal.
We had an arrangement.

27:27.045 --> 27:29.206
Look, do you have a superior
I could talk to?

27:29.314 --> 27:30.440
Jasec?

27:45.697 --> 27:46.823
Jaffa.

27:52.737 --> 27:53.931
CARTER: Jasec was carrying that with him.

27:54.039 --> 27:57.839
It's a short-range communicator
he probably used to contact the Jaffa.

27:57.942 --> 28:00.137
No doubt he snuck it in
with his personal effects.

28:00.245 --> 28:04.341
Turns out we didn't destroy all of the ships
intended for the attack.

28:04.449 --> 28:08.442
One of them was dispatched early, and
it's been sitting somewhere here on Earth

28:08.553 --> 28:10.521
waiting for the order to strike.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.453
And he knew this all along?

28:12.557 --> 28:14.286
He got his intel from some
heavily-involved Jaffa

28:14.392 --> 28:15.950
who were having second thoughts
about the whole thing.

28:16.061 --> 28:19.087
Apparently, he knew them
from some weapon-smuggling operation

28:19.197 --> 28:20.721
he used to run.

28:20.832 --> 28:22.857
He found out about the cargo ships
and made a deal with us

28:22.967 --> 28:24.127
so he could come to Earth.

28:24.235 --> 28:26.669
Where he made a deal with the Jaffa,
they'd give him the naquadah,

28:26.771 --> 28:28.864
he would sell it,
and they would split the proceeds.

28:28.973 --> 28:30.804
Nice and tidy.

28:31.309 --> 28:33.334
Where's this cargo ship located?

28:33.445 --> 28:37.074
He doesn't know. The Jaffa he was with
was his contact, and he's gone, so...

28:37.182 --> 28:39.582
Can't we just locate this cargo ship
the same way we did the others?

28:39.684 --> 28:40.776
No, that won't work this time.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.375
This particular cargo ship is cloaked,

28:42.487 --> 28:45.115
so doing an orbital scan
won't reveal any trace of the naquadah.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.657
But Jasec claims
that Arkad marked the naquadah

28:47.759 --> 28:50.421
to make sure that none of his men
would try to double-cross him.

28:50.528 --> 28:52.587
He says he can calibrate
our detection systems

28:52.697 --> 28:55.097
to pick up its unique energy signature.

28:56.167 --> 28:59.432
Just out of interest,
what did he ask for in return?

28:59.838 --> 29:02.568
We recover the naquadah,
we give it to him, he sells it,

29:02.674 --> 29:04.972
and we split the profits 50-50.

29:05.844 --> 29:07.812
And what was your counter-offer?

29:07.912 --> 29:11.973
He gets zero, and we don't lock him away
for the rest of his life.

29:12.350 --> 29:13.977
He took the offer.

29:21.426 --> 29:24.054
See, you've cast too wide a variance.

29:25.597 --> 29:29.556
- Lf you just narrow the parameters.
- Narrow the parameters?

29:31.035 --> 29:32.263
That's genius.

29:32.370 --> 29:36.329
I don't know about genius.
It's just marginally brilliant.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.409
Now, if I can just figure out
how to sync it up.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.774
I'm sure it'll come to you.

29:41.346 --> 29:44.406
- So how are the readings coming along?
- Slowly.

29:45.083 --> 29:49.782
It's no wonder. I don't mind telling you,
I'm a bit disappointed in this facility.

29:49.888 --> 29:51.219
I was expecting more.

29:51.322 --> 29:53.381
Well, at times, so do we.

29:53.491 --> 29:55.857
But the truth is, the Stargate program
just doesn't get the support

29:55.960 --> 29:58.326
it used to from the people in charge.

29:58.429 --> 30:00.556
- Why not?
- Eureka!

30:01.266 --> 30:02.961
One down, 12 to go.

30:04.402 --> 30:08.031
That's too bad,
because after all your Stargate program

30:08.139 --> 30:10.937
has accomplished
for this network of planets,

30:11.042 --> 30:14.345
I would think the decision-makers
would show it the respect it deserves.

30:14.345 --> 30:15.403
I would think the decision-makers
would show it the respect it deserves.

30:15.847 --> 30:16.905
Yeah.

30:20.418 --> 30:24.912
Say, how would you like to go out
to dinner with me once this is all over?

30:25.623 --> 30:28.217
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

30:28.326 --> 30:32.888
Well, I'm an incredibly busy person
with very little free time.

30:32.997 --> 30:35.659
And you're a jerk.

30:35.767 --> 30:38.327
Of course there's that.

30:38.736 --> 30:42.331
Look, I'm sorry I had to trick you,
but if you'd known what I had planned,

30:42.440 --> 30:44.601
you would have never
let me on this planet.

30:44.709 --> 30:46.700
I'm talking about the way
you treated Vala.

30:46.811 --> 30:49.041
To think that for the first time
since she was a child

30:49.147 --> 30:51.877
she was actually beginning to trust you.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.820
(PHONE RINGING)

30:57.722 --> 30:58.711
Hello?

30:59.190 --> 31:01.715
Hi. Just calling to remind you
about dinner tonight.

31:01.826 --> 31:04.386
<i>Dinner? Tonight?</i>

31:04.796 --> 31:05.763
You forgot?

31:06.264 --> 31:07.231
(SIGHS)

31:08.233 --> 31:11.031
No, no. No. It's just that something
very important has come up.

31:11.135 --> 31:13.330
<i>I think we might be better off</i>
<i>rescheduling.</i>

31:13.438 --> 31:15.804
Mom heads back tomorrow morning.
We can't reschedule.

31:15.907 --> 31:18.137
I'm dealing with a major situation here.

31:22.747 --> 31:25.341
Okay. What do you want me to tell her?

31:29.854 --> 31:31.048
Tell her I'll be there.

31:35.360 --> 31:39.456
Sir, we've finished calibrating the device,
and we've got a lock on their location.

31:39.564 --> 31:43.295
They're approximately 30 miles
outside of Cheyenne Mountain.

31:47.639 --> 31:50.802
It seems that one of the targets
was their stargate.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.980
Tell them I'll send in some tactical units.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.542
I wouldn't.

31:59.651 --> 32:02.119
If the Jaffa suspect
they're about to be compromised,

32:02.220 --> 32:05.121
I have no doubt
they'll detonate the naquadah.

32:05.223 --> 32:10.217
I would suggest using a little stealth
and cunning to take them off-guard,

32:10.328 --> 32:13.126
- and I'd be happy to help out.
- No, thanks.

32:14.232 --> 32:16.291
Well, like it or not,
you're going to need my help.

32:16.401 --> 32:19.199
Some of these Jaffa know me.
They trust me.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.706
And there's also the matter
of the rigged cargo ship.

32:25.143 --> 32:27.577
This is the first I've heard of it, sir.

32:27.679 --> 32:30.477
Are you sure? I thought I'd mentioned it.

32:30.581 --> 32:34.142
According to Te'rak,
the cargo ship is rigged to blow

32:34.252 --> 32:36.812
in the event anyone tries to move it.

32:37.922 --> 32:41.221
Now, fortunately for you,
I have the override code.

32:43.761 --> 32:45.786
Please, General, let me help.

32:45.897 --> 32:49.230
Give me this one final shot at redemption.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.295
This is nice.

32:55.406 --> 32:58.864
It reminds me of that afternoon
we spent on Serras-Dia.

32:59.510 --> 33:02.502
Running for our lives from the authorities?

33:02.613 --> 33:04.410
You've got to admit
it was great daddy-daughter time.

33:04.515 --> 33:06.483
As I recall,
we would not have been on the run

33:06.584 --> 33:08.609
had you not been greedy
and gone back for seconds.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.847
I couldn't help myself.

33:10.955 --> 33:13.753
You know, you couldn't even pull off
this simple naquadah deal

33:13.858 --> 33:16.725
without complicating things
with your silly little side scams.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.763
- You always were so sloppy.
<i>- CARTER ON RADIO: Vala?</i>

33:22.533 --> 33:23.522
Yes, Sam?

33:23.801 --> 33:25.234
The naquadah signal is emanating

33:25.336 --> 33:27.804
approximately a half-mile north
of your position.

33:27.905 --> 33:31.341
<i>I'll confirm visual sighting.</i>
<i>Requesting radio silence.</i>

33:33.311 --> 33:35.370

<i>I have delivered the package</i>
<i>to the appointed area.</i>

33:38.249 --> 33:41.150
Good.
Keep me apprised of any developments.

33:43.154 --> 33:45.554
Sir, do you have to be somewhere?

33:51.195 --> 33:53.060
Whatever happened to that boy
you used to like?

33:53.164 --> 33:54.893
The one whose father was a merchant?

33:54.999 --> 33:57.092
I always thought you two
would end up together.

33:57.201 --> 34:01.069
Veron Karn?
We were 10 and he moved away.

34:01.172 --> 34:04.608
That's too bad.
I saw a lot of potential in him.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.199
Can you stop trying
to endear yourself to me?

34:06.310 --> 34:08.005
As far as I'm concerned,
you're a lost cause,

34:08.112 --> 34:09.136
and I wouldn't be surprised

34:09.247 --> 34:11.306
if you were somehow involved
in Arkad's plot against Earth.

34:11.416 --> 34:13.441
That would be low, even for me.

34:13.551 --> 34:16.111
I have no idea what you're capable of.

34:16.220 --> 34:17.517
(ENERGY SURGING)

34:21.626 --> 34:24.254
Hey, fellows. It's me, Jasec.

34:26.297 --> 34:30.597
Me and my partner, actually, my daughter.
Isn't she pretty?

34:30.701 --> 34:33.465
We're here to check out the merchandise.
Is that okay?

34:33.571 --> 34:35.334
There's been a change of plans, Jasec,

34:35.440 --> 34:39.206
and unfortunately, you're no longer part
of this new arrangement.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.650
<i>VALA ON RADIO: Jasec, you idiot.</i>

34:51.756 --> 34:53.951
- That's the signal.
- Let's go.

35:01.732 --> 35:04.826
There's no need for you
to carry on with your attack,

35:04.936 --> 35:07.837
because Arkad is dead and
there's no need to sacrifice yourselves.

35:07.939 --> 35:10.908
Or the naquadah. Let's talk deal.

35:11.008 --> 35:14.910
I believe that was Te'rak's intention
before he disappeared.

35:15.813 --> 35:19.044
Really? I hope he's all right.
He probably just got lost.

35:19.150 --> 35:22.916
These woods are very confusing.
You can get turned around so easily.

35:23.020 --> 35:24.180
Enough!

35:25.756 --> 35:28.247
Wait. I can't watch my daughter die.

35:31.729 --> 35:33.822
I can't watch me die, either.

35:43.574 --> 35:45.041
Thanks, honey.

35:46.410 --> 35:48.401
Vala! Get to the ship!

35:53.151 --> 35:54.618
(GROANING)

36:11.802 --> 36:13.895
I've located the cargo ship.

36:15.640 --> 36:16.629
Hold it.

36:16.741 --> 36:18.299
The naquadah on that ship
is rigged to blow

36:18.409 --> 36:22.106
unless I input the override code
Te'rak gave me.

36:22.213 --> 36:26.673
- All right. I'm coming with you.
- No, I'm not going to risk your life, too.

36:27.151 --> 36:29.415
Listen to your father for once.

36:31.956 --> 36:36.052
Here. In case I don't make it.

37:10.761 --> 37:12.661
(GROANS) Drat!

37:27.712 --> 37:28.838
Jasec?

37:31.616 --> 37:34.915
Sorry, sweetheart.
There never was an override code.

37:35.853 --> 37:38.549
Take care of yourself. Daddy loves you.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.192
Hey.

37:51.035 --> 37:52.662
(GRUNTING)

37:58.409 --> 38:02.846
- You okay?
- Yes. Did everything go as planned?

38:02.947 --> 38:04.881
It did on our end. Sam?

38:06.317 --> 38:08.012
The real cargo ship is secure.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.381
I guess we won't be needing
that override code?

38:14.158 --> 38:16.956
- No, you won't.
<i>- Sorry, Vala.</i>

38:18.629 --> 38:19.823

38:22.099 --> 38:26.968
Glad to hear it.
Good job, SG-1, and... Landry out!

38:48.726 --> 38:52.093
- You're late.
- I got away as soon as I could.

38:53.097 --> 38:54.462
KIM: You're here.

38:57.034 --> 38:58.524
And that's what counts.

39:00.404 --> 39:01.564
Please.

39:05.876 --> 39:09.073
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you for inviting me.

39:13.217 --> 39:15.014
- Carolyn.
- Dad.

39:17.621 --> 39:20.784
We have a lot to talk about.

39:22.993 --> 39:24.324
We do, Kim.

39:31.001 --> 39:34.596
Well, you've had long enough
to look over the merchandise.

39:35.172 --> 39:39.609
What are you offering for this cargo ship
full of weapons-grade naquadah?

39:40.378 --> 39:46.010
You mean a cargo ship full of lead bars
and these things?

39:47.051 --> 39:49.451
This is a surprise.

39:49.553 --> 39:53.250
They've included
the Jibbaran virility enhancers.

39:53.357 --> 39:57.760
Well, that's a bonus.
Go ahead, try a sample.

40:04.101 --> 40:06.865
I understand they're very powerful.

40:09.373 --> 40:11.307
Can you feel it working?

40:17.948 --> 40:20.109
Yes, I can.

40:20.618 --> 40:22.245
Let's talk deal.

40:22.887 --> 40:25.617
I may keep a couple of these for myself.

40:25.723 --> 40:27.315
Better to have them and not need them,

40:27.425 --> 40:30.519
than to need them
and not have them, right?

40:38.736 --> 40:41.500
We talk the same language, right?

41:14.505 --> 41:16.302
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

41:16.407 --> 41:17.874
Just a minute.

41:28.619 --> 41:29.813
Come in.

41:31.188 --> 41:34.385
- Hi.
- Hi. What's this?

41:34.492 --> 41:37.188
- Girl's night in.
- Nice.

41:41.165 --> 41:44.259
- So, how're you doing?
- Great.

41:45.469 --> 41:47.733
Yeah, wonderful.
Everything went according to plan.

41:47.838 --> 41:51.399
We led Jasec to the decoy ship
while you secured the real one.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.205
He scammed us,
but we scammed him better.

41:57.281 --> 41:58.441
Cheers.

41:59.950 --> 42:02.145
So where are the boys tonight?

42:02.486 --> 42:07.048
Cameron has a date, Daniel's exhausted,
and Teal'c got tickets to some show.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.892
<i>WOMAN: My girlfriends and I talk</i>
<i>about a lot of things.</i>

42:16.000 --> 42:18.833
<i>There's just one topic we rarely discuss.</i>

42:18.936 --> 42:20.267
<i>Vaginas.</i>

42:20.371 --> 42:25.172
<i>And I asked myself, "Why is that?</i>
<i>Why don't we talk about vaginas?"</i>

42:25.276 --> 42:29.474
<i>Why are work and kids and holiday plans</i>
<i>more acceptable topics of conversation</i>

42:29.580 --> 42:31.309
<i>than our own vaginas?</i>

42:31.415 --> 42:35.784
<i>And I didn't have an answer,</i>
<i>so I took it upon myself to find out.</i>

42:35.886 --> 42:39.117
<i>I started to talk about vaginas at work,</i>
<i>at home,</i>

42:39.223 --> 42:41.350
<i>sometimes even at fancy restaurants.</i>

42:41.458 --> 42:43.926
<i>Soon, my friends started to talk</i>
<i>about vaginas as well,</i>

42:44.028 --> 42:47.862
<i>and it was only a matter of time</i>
<i>before it became a hot conversation topic.</i>

42:47.965 --> 42:51.366
