00:05.437 --> 00:06.886
Previously on Blunt Talk...

00:06.888 --> 00:08.138
These are great, Walter.

00:08.140 --> 00:09.606
When my eldest son was little,

00:09.608 --> 00:11.725
I used to do them for him at bedtime.

00:11.727 --> 00:13.643
- Your son the boxer?
- Yes.

00:13.645 --> 00:15.195
Rafe the boxer.

00:15.197 --> 00:17.230
- Walter Blunt!
- Hey!

00:17.232 --> 00:19.032
You can call me Dad, Bertie.

00:19.034 --> 00:20.984
Walter Blunt is for the public.

00:20.986 --> 00:22.952
Jewish politicians are really funny.

00:22.954 --> 00:24.287
Is that a joke?

00:24.289 --> 00:26.322
Walter, do you want to spoon?

00:26.324 --> 00:27.991
That would be very reassuring.

00:27.993 --> 00:29.292
Could I spoon with you this time?

00:29.294 --> 00:30.994
I mean, I am a senior producer.

00:30.996 --> 00:32.628
It would be inappropriate.

00:32.631 --> 00:35.248
I have loneliness issues. Intimacy issues.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.801
Anxiety issues. Promiscuity issues.

00:37.803 --> 00:40.220
- How is your magician?
- He disappeared.

00:40.222 --> 00:42.555
- Magically?
- No, he went back to his wife.

00:42.557 --> 00:45.175
And I don't know if I'm having
some sort of weird reaction,

00:45.177 --> 00:47.560
but gambling feels better than sex.

00:47.562 --> 00:49.596
I can't believe my magician
gave me fake pearls!

00:49.598 --> 00:52.599
Forget the damn pearls, Celia. Just run!

01:37.279 --> 01:39.312
Hello, Harry.

01:39.314 --> 01:40.980
Where's Walter?

01:42.567 --> 01:46.452
I think my problem is
that I'm not a real person.

01:46.454 --> 01:49.072
I feel like I'm walking
around inside myself.

01:49.074 --> 01:50.740
Like I'm in a costume.

01:50.742 --> 01:53.126
Hey, don't worry. A lot
of people feel that way.

01:53.128 --> 01:56.496
I mean, I've been stuck in
the same costume for 23 years.

01:56.498 --> 01:58.214
Oh, dear. I'm sorry to hear that.

01:58.216 --> 02:00.633
No, it's okay.

02:00.635 --> 02:05.338
But what in your mind makes a person real?

02:05.340 --> 02:07.974
If you're able to love.

02:07.976 --> 02:11.261
I see. But this isn't
about your gambling, is it?

02:11.263 --> 02:12.262
You're a romantic.

02:12.264 --> 02:14.597
I guess so.

02:14.599 --> 02:17.433
Do you want to know something pathetic?

02:18.737 --> 02:20.737
Each night before I go to sleep,

02:20.739 --> 02:24.107
I say, though I know no one can hear me,

02:24.109 --> 02:25.608
"Good night, my someone."

02:25.610 --> 02:28.278
Isn't that from The Music Man?

02:28.280 --> 02:30.613
Yeah, my father used to
sing it to me at night.

02:32.284 --> 02:34.417
I've always thought the someone

02:34.419 --> 02:36.502
is the person you haven't met yet

02:36.504 --> 02:39.088
but is out there somewhere.

02:41.209 --> 02:45.128
♪ Good night, my someone ♪

02:45.130 --> 02:48.765
♪ Good night, my love ♪

02:48.767 --> 02:52.969
♪ Sleep tight, my someone ♪

02:52.971 --> 02:56.139
♪ Sleep tight, my love ♪

02:56.141 --> 02:59.475
♪ A star is shining ♪

02:59.477 --> 03:02.528
♪ Its brightest light ♪

03:02.530 --> 03:05.982
♪ Oh, good night, my love ♪

03:05.984 --> 03:09.485
♪ Oh, good night ♪

03:24.719 --> 03:26.719
Rafe?

03:26.721 --> 03:28.504
Oh!

03:28.506 --> 03:31.424
It's good to see you, son.

03:31.426 --> 03:33.559
It's good to see you, Walter.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.094
Dad.

03:35.096 --> 03:37.063
Call me Dad.

03:43.488 --> 03:44.854
Are you okay?

03:44.856 --> 03:47.690
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

03:47.692 --> 03:49.525
Celia.

03:52.948 --> 03:55.164
You're up, Jim.

03:58.670 --> 04:01.504
How much is the old man
paying you these days, Harry?

04:01.506 --> 04:03.706
That's between me and the major.

04:03.708 --> 04:06.626
Don't make trouble, Rafe.
He's had a rough spell.

04:06.628 --> 04:08.878
Oh, yeah, I saw him on YouTube

04:08.880 --> 04:11.130
performing Shakespeare on the Jag.

04:11.132 --> 04:13.182
Well, Harry,

04:13.184 --> 04:15.301
doesn't the boy look good?

04:15.303 --> 04:17.103
- Yes, Major.
- Did he fill you in?

04:17.105 --> 04:19.721
- He's fighting tomorrow night.
- Yes, Major.

04:19.724 --> 04:22.308
It'll be good to see you
in the ring again, Rafe.

04:22.310 --> 04:24.277
- Been too long.
- That's right.

04:24.279 --> 04:27.397
Oh, does he have power!

04:27.399 --> 04:29.615
Oh, Lord.

04:29.617 --> 04:32.652
Harry lets me have an egg once a week.

04:32.654 --> 04:34.620
Can you believe that?

04:34.622 --> 04:37.907
I'm on a strict gruel regimen.

04:37.909 --> 04:39.575
Oh, my heart bleeds.

04:39.577 --> 04:41.294
You're a regular Oliver Twist.

04:41.296 --> 04:43.162
Harry still tucking you in at night?

04:43.164 --> 04:46.549
Rafe, be a good lad.

04:46.551 --> 04:49.385
It's all right, Harry.

04:49.387 --> 04:52.505
I know you're still mad at me, son.

04:52.507 --> 04:54.590
But I've missed you.

04:54.592 --> 04:58.594
And I would like this
cold war to be at an end.

04:58.596 --> 05:01.814
So what do you say?

05:01.816 --> 05:03.016
Detente?

05:04.486 --> 05:05.768
I'm here, aren't I?

05:10.241 --> 05:13.743
So, what's the scouting
report on your opponent?

05:13.745 --> 05:16.612
A young Mex heavyweight named Hernandez.

05:16.614 --> 05:18.448
Part of Golden Boy.

05:18.450 --> 05:21.451
He's on the way up. Called El Toro.

05:21.453 --> 05:23.453
Oh, I like that.

05:23.455 --> 05:26.506
The Tower of London versus El Toro.

05:26.508 --> 05:28.124
So how long have you been training?

05:28.126 --> 05:30.760
I haven't. Got the call two days ago.

05:30.762 --> 05:33.463
I'm subbing in for a Brit,
Galloway, who came up lame.

05:33.465 --> 05:35.715
I heard of Galloway. A southpaw.

05:35.717 --> 05:37.850
Yeah, well, they needed another Brit

05:37.852 --> 05:39.685
'cause all the posters
have the Union Jack on,

05:39.687 --> 05:42.305
so... whew, whew, here I am.

05:42.307 --> 05:43.806
And who will be in your corner?

05:43.808 --> 05:45.558
Oh, they'll probably
assign me some wet-brain.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.944
All I need's a bucket.

05:47.946 --> 05:50.613
Rafe.

05:50.615 --> 05:52.448
Could I be in your corner?

05:52.450 --> 05:54.400
- Do you have a bucket?
- Oh, yes.

05:54.402 --> 05:56.819
- Then you're in.
- All right!

05:56.821 --> 06:00.623
And now entering the ring,

06:00.625 --> 06:04.377
fighting out of Fresno, California,

06:04.379 --> 06:07.046
the Tower of London!

06:07.048 --> 06:10.166
Hey, maybe we could get
matching silk robes made.

06:10.168 --> 06:13.002
Royal purple. "Blunt" across the shoulders.

06:13.004 --> 06:16.839
I'm not wearing any bloody Liberace robe.

06:16.841 --> 06:20.009
Right. Well, it was
just a thought, you know.

06:20.011 --> 06:22.512
Hey!

06:22.514 --> 06:24.847
Don't throw a punch unless you mean it.

06:29.020 --> 06:30.853
Mwah!

06:32.526 --> 06:35.027
I can't get my magician out of my mind.

06:35.029 --> 06:37.479
When I'm in traffic, I look over,

06:37.481 --> 06:38.947
hoping he's in the car next to me.

06:38.949 --> 06:40.899
I look for him everywhere.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.652
You got it bad, but I understand.

06:43.654 --> 06:45.904
He was sexy.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.040
He had teeth like a wolf.

06:48.042 --> 06:50.492
I should just give up on men.

06:50.494 --> 06:52.127
I have sex too easily,

06:52.129 --> 06:53.912
and then I always go for
the ones who disappear.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.715
Oh, and alcoholics.
That's my other speciality.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.917
Listen, don't give up on men.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.670
They have a wonderful stink.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.672
They carry luggage.

07:03.674 --> 07:07.092
And when you have a firm cock in your hand,

07:07.094 --> 07:10.562
all the shit they put you
through feels worth it.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.980
That's true.

07:11.982 --> 07:14.683
You just have to wade
through a lot of idiots

07:14.685 --> 07:16.935
until you find the right idiot.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.105
Like my beautiful Teddy.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.858
I have a new crew since
you were here last, Rafe.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.943
Except for Rosalie, of course.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.412
Good old Rosalie. She deserves a medal.

07:27.414 --> 07:31.833
Yes. I was thinking of having
my senior staff over for dinner

07:31.835 --> 07:33.702
so that you can get to know them.

07:33.704 --> 07:35.754
And maybe Vivian would let me have Bertie.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.373
Oh, I'd love to see the little one,
but I don't want a dinner party.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.793
Oh, come on. Harry and I have
been looking to entertain more.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.797
I wanted to remind you, sir, that
your office loo is not available.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.468
Ah. Do I need to tinkle?

07:49.470 --> 07:51.970
Rafe, do you need to tinkle?

07:51.972 --> 07:54.022
No, I don't need to tinkle.

08:07.371 --> 08:09.454
Mr. Blunt.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.741
It is an honor to meet you.

08:12.743 --> 08:15.661
I am very excited to
be on your show tonight.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.496
Tonight?

08:17.498 --> 08:19.047
Yes, I'm with the UN.

08:19.049 --> 08:21.667
I lead the commission
on genital mutilation.

08:21.669 --> 08:22.834
- Oh.
- You're interviewing me.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.253
- Emanuel Kendall.
- Yes.

08:24.255 --> 08:26.054
Oh, it's wonderful to meet you.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.009
So, you did need a tinkle.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.429
Emanuel, this is my firstborn Rafe.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.181
He's a champion boxer.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.851
Rafe, this is Emanuel
Kendall. He's with the UN.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.405
Working to eradicate genital mutilation.

08:43.407 --> 08:45.190
Hello, Rafe.

08:52.199 --> 08:55.701
Rosalie, the prodigal son returns.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.502
Hello, handsome. Been a while.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.121
Hello, gorgeous.

08:59.123 --> 09:02.257
I have to dash. I've
got to go yell at Gardner

09:02.259 --> 09:04.176
before he leaves for the weekend.

09:04.178 --> 09:06.178
- Will you be around later?
- Yes, all day.

09:06.180 --> 09:09.047
And we're having a dinner
party at my house tonight.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.050
I'll be there. Mwah.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.468
Are you peckish, son?

09:13.470 --> 09:16.638
Do you need a snack to
keep your strength up?

09:18.559 --> 09:20.058
Yeah.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.694
I'll be in my office.
Make yourself at home.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.567
Walter.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.652
Do we have an appointment?

09:30.654 --> 09:33.205
I'm here for work.

09:33.207 --> 09:35.741
That's good. You're functioning.

09:35.743 --> 09:40.045
And I saw that you installed
a bidet in your bathroom.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.748
That's gonna help you
with your anal anxiety.

09:42.750 --> 09:46.418
I thought I had oral anxiety.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.803
You have both.

09:47.805 --> 09:52.007
Oral and anal.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.675
I'm not surprised.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.647
Can you open this jar of herring?

09:58.649 --> 10:00.098
Is this another Jewish joke?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.767
No, I really like herring.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.235
Harry turned me onto it. It's brain food.

10:03.237 --> 10:05.404
Well, don't listen to Harry.

10:05.406 --> 10:08.490
Remember, he's the one who set
you off on this gambling spree.

10:08.492 --> 10:12.277
That's over now. That's
why I'm seeing Dr. Weiss.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.695
Shit.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.618
Oh, shit.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.121
Shit!

10:23.123 --> 10:25.874
Right, sometimes...

10:25.876 --> 10:27.376
Don't get herring all over the floor.

10:27.378 --> 10:28.960
Don't... don't worry. Don't worry.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.016
Shit. That's a...

10:35.018 --> 10:36.768
that's really well-sealed herr... herring.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.271
Here, let me try.

10:39.273 --> 10:41.223
Good luck.

10:41.225 --> 10:43.358
Oh!

10:43.360 --> 10:44.810
Who are you?

10:44.812 --> 10:46.645
Did you just install Mr. Blunt's bidet?

10:46.647 --> 10:48.363
Yeah, yeah, I did.

10:48.365 --> 10:51.316
I specialize in VIP bidet
installation. Do you need one?

10:51.318 --> 10:53.952
Rafe, the major wants you in his office.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.153
Wants you to meet his analyst.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.371
Harry, do you know this man?

10:56.373 --> 10:59.207
Yeah, this is the major's son Rafe.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.128
See ya.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.334
I could have opened that,
but I have hyperhidrosis,

11:09.336 --> 11:11.803
so my hands kind of self-lubricate.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.388
What?

11:13.390 --> 11:16.808
I have wet hands all the time.

11:26.937 --> 11:29.521
May I come in?

11:29.523 --> 11:31.406
Uh, Celia.

11:31.408 --> 11:32.991
Yeah, sure.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.360
Oh, bloody hell.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.863
Does everyone have a shrine to him?

11:37.865 --> 11:40.532
Um, yup. That's... that's part of the job.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.536
Right. Hello.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.872
What's this?

11:46.874 --> 11:48.707
That's my, um...

11:50.878 --> 11:53.462
very long...

12:04.024 --> 12:05.724
handkerchief.

12:05.726 --> 12:09.227
We have made tremendous
progress the last few years

12:09.229 --> 12:13.482
raising awareness about
the more than 125 million

12:13.484 --> 12:16.568
girls and women who have
been cut against their will.

12:16.570 --> 12:19.905
Shocking. It's something
that is probably very hard

12:19.907 --> 12:22.040
for my viewers even to fathom.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.793
Well, my goal is to raise awareness.

12:24.795 --> 12:29.247
Male circumcision, while
culturally more accepted,

12:29.249 --> 12:32.667
is also considered by many
to be genital mutilation.

12:32.669 --> 12:35.420
Really? You see, I'd never considered that.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.639
I suppose it was vanity on my part.

12:37.641 --> 12:40.258
I wanted my two sons to be like me,

12:40.260 --> 12:42.561
and so they were circumcised.

12:42.563 --> 12:44.896
What are you talking about, Mr. Blunt?

12:44.898 --> 12:47.182
What you're talking about.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.436
Uh...

12:53.407 --> 12:55.607
but you're not circumcised.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.658
Yes, I am.

12:56.660 --> 12:59.277
But I glanced at you in the men's room.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.246
It's just a nervous habit.

13:01.248 --> 13:04.032
And you are definitely in possession

13:04.034 --> 13:08.286
of a substantial foreskin.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.621
You're wrong.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.339
I'm kind of an expert.

13:11.341 --> 13:15.126
I don't quite understand
why you would deny this.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.012
I'm not denying!

13:17.014 --> 13:18.463
This is absurd.

13:18.465 --> 13:22.217
Um, we'll now take a commercial break.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.219
Rosalie, I need you.

13:35.365 --> 13:37.282
Who booked this lunatic?

13:37.284 --> 13:39.951
What is he talking about?
I'm circumcised, aren't I?

13:39.953 --> 13:42.070
Walter, it's been 20 years.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.205
But I remember it was very red

13:44.207 --> 13:46.324
and very uncircumcised.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.710
- Very red?
- In a good way.

13:48.712 --> 13:51.162
Enthusiastic.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.632
But definitely uncircumcised.

13:53.634 --> 13:55.417
- You sure?
- Yes.

13:55.419 --> 13:58.670
I know these things.

14:01.975 --> 14:07.012
All of those hooded penises
I saw in the Marines, Harry,

14:07.014 --> 14:08.980
I thought they were circumcised.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.149
How could I have been so stupid?

14:11.151 --> 14:12.817
I'm not sure, sir.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.736
But I understand.

14:14.738 --> 14:18.607
For years I thought a
tangerine was an orange.

14:18.609 --> 14:21.409
It's because I never had a father.

14:21.411 --> 14:26.197
Oh, I remember my mother
explaining it all to me.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.833
I must have misunderstood.

14:30.087 --> 14:32.454
For 60-odd years.

14:32.456 --> 14:36.091
Well, we're never too old to
learn something new, Major.

14:36.093 --> 14:37.709
But now pull yourself together.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.344
You have both your boys tonight.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.679
Yes, you're right.

14:40.681 --> 14:43.214
I must put all this nonsense behind me.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.184
But you know, Harry, you could have told me

14:46.186 --> 14:47.552
that I was uncircumcised.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.354
It did not occur to me, sir,

14:49.356 --> 14:51.806
that you needed elucidation on this front.

14:51.808 --> 14:55.393
But if I sense another
blind spot of this magnitude,

14:55.395 --> 14:57.562
I will endeavor to point it out.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.903
Thank you, Harry. That's all I ask.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.905
Sir.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.997
All right,

15:15.999 --> 15:18.166
I just want to say

15:18.168 --> 15:20.168
how very happy it makes me

15:20.170 --> 15:22.420
to have my two sons with me.

15:23.724 --> 15:25.690
And, of course, all of you.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.309
Rosalie, Harry, dearest friends.

15:28.311 --> 15:30.862
Celia, like a daughter.

15:30.864 --> 15:34.065
And Jim, third son.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.650
Hey, brother.

15:35.652 --> 15:39.788
So I feel like a very lucky man.

15:39.790 --> 15:43.491
But most importantly, I would
like to make a toast to Rafe

15:43.493 --> 15:47.379
and to his victory tomorrow night.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.913
Rafe's victory.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.081
Yay.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.966
- Rafe's victory.
- Yeah.

15:51.968 --> 15:53.968
To my victory.

15:59.760 --> 16:03.561
- Oh, let's dance, eh.
- Easy, lad.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.647
Oh, come on, Harry.

16:05.649 --> 16:07.932
"Let's eat, drink, and be merry,

16:07.934 --> 16:09.768
for tomorrow we die."

16:09.770 --> 16:12.020
- Rafe, turn that off.
- Oh, I like it.

16:12.022 --> 16:14.105
Come on, darling, let's
have a little dance, okay?

16:14.107 --> 16:17.442
Rafe, take it easy. You've
got a big fight tomorrow.

16:17.444 --> 16:20.278
Oi, you wanted a fucking party.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.415
- Was that the F word?
- Not in front of...

16:23.417 --> 16:26.451
In front of genitally
mutilated son number two?

16:31.174 --> 16:33.458
Fine.

16:37.848 --> 16:41.549
Well, I think we should call that a night.

16:41.551 --> 16:45.386
Harry, you and I will drive
Bertie home to his mother.

16:45.388 --> 16:47.972
Walter, I'm sorry that happened.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.308
But you know how he gets when he drinks.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.194
Yes, he gets like me.

16:53.196 --> 16:55.647
Come on, son.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.488
Sorry to bother you. Everyone's gone.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.573
I was just loading the dishwasher.

17:05.575 --> 17:07.492
Thank you. And I'm sorry.

17:07.493 --> 17:09.828
- I'm an asshole.
- No, you're not.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.713
You just had too much to drink.

17:11.714 --> 17:14.082
Well, that's no excuse.

17:14.084 --> 17:18.252
I wasn't even that drunk.
It's just, I don't know.

17:18.255 --> 17:22.390
When I'm around my old man, it's
like I become stuck, you know?

17:22.392 --> 17:24.592
Playing a role.

17:24.594 --> 17:28.012
I become a clown, an idiot.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.266
A loser.

17:39.609 --> 17:43.161
I haven't ruined Bertie yet, have I, Harry?

17:43.163 --> 17:45.196
Not yet, Major.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.198
There's still time.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.584
Oh.

17:51.755 --> 17:54.756
What are we going to do about Rafe?

17:54.758 --> 17:57.458
I tried to show him how much I admire him,

17:57.460 --> 17:58.676
but it does no good.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.378
I know, Major.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.430
Will he ever find himself?

18:02.432 --> 18:07.101
Perhaps your shadow has
been too large for him, sir.

18:07.103 --> 18:09.220
No.

18:10.640 --> 18:14.108
I find this very upsetting, Harry.

18:14.110 --> 18:16.227
I understand, sir.

18:16.229 --> 18:19.147
Would you like a Valium or
a Xanax with your whiskey?

18:19.149 --> 18:20.782
Oh.

18:20.784 --> 18:23.568
Would it be unwise to have both?

18:25.789 --> 18:27.572
I wasn't too loud, was I?

18:28.825 --> 18:31.492
You were perfect, love.

18:31.494 --> 18:33.244
We fit nice together.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.549
Did you just sleep with me
'cause I'm Walter Blunt's son?

18:37.551 --> 18:39.918
Maybe a little.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.253
You know, for the taboo of it.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.638
Oh, Christ.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.007
But really, from the moment I saw you,

18:46.009 --> 18:48.843
it flashed across my mind,
"Oh, I think I fancy him."

18:48.845 --> 18:50.428
I knew you'd be trouble.

18:54.317 --> 18:56.851
I should go soon.

18:56.853 --> 18:59.103
No.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.989
Stay.

19:00.991 --> 19:02.190
Please.

19:02.192 --> 19:04.826
Okay, but I don't want Walter to see me.

19:04.828 --> 19:06.611
I'm always afraid of disappointing him.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.246
Don't worry about that.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.748
When I'm around, no one
disappoints him more than me.

19:12.202 --> 19:15.503
I'm a bartender and a club
fighter. I've never measured up.

19:15.505 --> 19:17.171
I think you're wrong.

19:17.173 --> 19:19.624
I think he is proud of
you. You just can't see it.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.126
He's so excited about watching you fight.

19:22.128 --> 19:25.463
But I'm gonna lose.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.765
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, I do.

19:30.353 --> 19:32.186
I'm taking a dive.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.807
I'm here to lose.

19:35.809 --> 19:37.692
That's why they called me.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.312
Oh.

19:44.234 --> 19:46.784
What round are you taking a dive in?

19:52.075 --> 19:53.041
Ha!

19:58.665 --> 19:59.914
Celia?

19:59.916 --> 20:02.000
Rafe, what the hell is going on?

20:02.002 --> 20:05.003
Morning. What would you
two like for breakfast?

20:05.005 --> 20:07.422
Don't... don't... don't...
don't offer them food, Harry.

20:07.424 --> 20:08.973
I want to know what's happening.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.843
Um...

20:11.845 --> 20:14.178
well, I have, um...

20:14.180 --> 20:18.349
some issues and Rafe's been very sweet.

20:18.351 --> 20:22.270
And, um... well, I am a
senior producer, Walter.

20:26.943 --> 20:29.410
So was it very red?

20:29.412 --> 20:31.245
Was what very red?

20:31.247 --> 20:32.697
Rafe's penis.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.749
She's joking.

20:34.751 --> 20:36.951
No, it wasn't that red.

20:36.953 --> 20:38.870
It's all set.

20:38.872 --> 20:41.589
Got six grand on him going
down in the second round.

20:41.591 --> 20:43.291
But I can still root for him, right?

20:43.293 --> 20:45.877
I mean, this is just
to make up for the money

20:45.879 --> 20:47.178
that I lost at that poker game.

20:47.180 --> 20:49.514
Of course it is, sweetheart.

20:51.718 --> 20:56.020
You know, my great-great-uncle
Alexander Blunt

20:56.022 --> 20:59.107
once sparred with the
Marquess of Queensberry.

20:59.109 --> 21:02.777
So boxing has long been in our blood.

21:02.779 --> 21:04.696
The Marxist of what?

21:04.698 --> 21:07.448
Not Marxist. Marquess.

21:07.450 --> 21:10.702
Oh, good Lord. The Marquess of Queensberry.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.570
He invented the rules of boxing.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.572
Not so hard, Harry.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.958
He also imprisoned Oscar Wilde.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.911
So he did one good thing and one bad thing.

21:19.913 --> 21:22.246
I have no idea what your
father's talking about.

21:22.248 --> 21:24.298
Just ignore him and wrap my hands.

21:24.300 --> 21:25.666
Great, Harry.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.922
I'm ready.

21:31.975 --> 21:34.759
Hands up. Rafe, get your hands up.

21:34.761 --> 21:37.261
Oh!

21:39.899 --> 21:41.933
Get off the ropes, Rafe.

21:42.936 --> 21:44.102
C'mon! Fight!

21:44.104 --> 21:47.071
Be careful, Rafe. Run! Run away!

21:47.073 --> 21:49.357
Okay, let's break.

21:51.694 --> 21:53.111
Hey!

21:53.113 --> 21:55.913
Hey, ref, did you see that?

21:55.915 --> 21:58.666
That was after the bell.
What's your problem, ref?

21:58.668 --> 22:00.451
You blind or something?

22:00.453 --> 22:02.336
What's happening, Rafe?

22:02.338 --> 22:05.289
Look, remember, your hands are
the bread, your head is the meat.

22:05.291 --> 22:06.841
You've got to protect the meat.

22:06.843 --> 22:08.626
Yeah, yeah. Make a sandwich.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.628
- My head's the meat, my hands are whole wheat.
- Right.

22:10.630 --> 22:13.631
I made a rhyme. What you think of that?

22:13.633 --> 22:15.099
You're not being serious, Rafe.

22:15.101 --> 22:18.102
He's nothing, this guy. You can take him.

22:18.104 --> 22:20.605
I know it. But you've got to get angry.

22:20.607 --> 22:21.889
Why get angry?

22:21.891 --> 22:23.808
Because he's destroying you.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.810
Yeah, well, that's the plan.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.979
Oh, you're lulling him in.

22:27.981 --> 22:29.981
Oh, that's smart. That's my boy.

22:29.983 --> 22:31.816
- You don't get it, do you?
- Don't get what?

22:31.818 --> 22:33.484
You've never seen me for who I am.

22:33.486 --> 22:36.037
Of course I do. You're a
Blunt. You're a warrior.

22:36.039 --> 22:37.738
Would you please stop?

22:37.740 --> 22:40.374
Would you stop building us up?

22:40.376 --> 22:42.794
Would you stop fantasizing about me?

22:42.796 --> 22:44.829
- About the Blunt name?
- Rafe.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.498
I'm a tomato can. A bum.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.667
They bring me in to lose.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.336
That's how I make my money.

22:53.673 --> 22:56.057
That's who your son is.

22:56.059 --> 22:57.725
What are you saying?

22:57.727 --> 22:59.343
I'm taking a dive in this round.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.814
And you know why I'm like this.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.684
I'm sorry, Rafe.

23:06.686 --> 23:09.070
I'm sorry for everything.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.857
I don't care if you win or lose.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.659
I love you.

23:39.886 --> 23:42.637
Yes! That's it!

23:42.639 --> 23:45.890
That's my boy. And a right.

23:45.892 --> 23:48.059
That's my son! Yes!

23:50.396 --> 23:52.396
I think you should stay the night.

23:52.398 --> 23:55.283
No chance. Those hard-boys
are already looking for me.

23:55.285 --> 23:58.202
I'll lay low in Portland
until this blows over.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.121
Are you sure? I mean,
doesn't it help at all

24:00.123 --> 24:02.156
that you got knocked
out in the third round?

24:02.158 --> 24:04.208
Are these mobsters that particular?

24:04.210 --> 24:06.494
Yeah, they're that particular.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.248
I'm so sorry you lost, Rafe.

24:10.250 --> 24:13.167
It's okay... brother.

24:15.421 --> 24:17.922
Ta-ta for now, Harry. I'll
see you when I see you.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.258
Be good, lad.

24:20.260 --> 24:22.260
So long, Rosalie.

24:22.262 --> 24:24.645
Take care of Walter for us, will you?

24:24.647 --> 24:27.181
I will. I always have.

24:29.435 --> 24:31.102
Take me with you.

24:31.104 --> 24:33.487
I've always wanted to say that.

24:33.489 --> 24:36.357
I'll come back when the heat dies down.

24:36.359 --> 24:39.994
I've always wanted to say that.

24:39.996 --> 24:42.196
I lost a lot of money on you.

24:42.198 --> 24:44.248
Was it worth it?

24:51.541 --> 24:54.425
I'm still not pleased about
you sleeping with Celia.

24:54.427 --> 24:57.795
But you make sure you call me
as soon as you get to Portland.

24:57.797 --> 25:00.631
Absolutely.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.100
Thanks for being in my corner, Walter.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.770
Dad, eh?

25:05.772 --> 25:07.138
Call me Dad.

25:07.140 --> 25:08.889
Listen, I've been thinking.

25:08.891 --> 25:11.642
I could get circumcised. Then
we could both be the same.

25:11.644 --> 25:15.446
I mean, Abraham wasn't
circumcised until he was 99.

25:15.448 --> 25:17.949
That's just next year for you, then.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.402
Dad.
