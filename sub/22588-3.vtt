Alright folks, listen on.
Hurry, hurry.

Here you are. Free umbrellas.
Win yourself a prize.

00:49.415 --> 00:52.150
Win yourself a prize

00:52.152 --> 00:53.317
These umbrellas are free.

00:53.319 --> 00:56.621
You can't win a prize
without an umbrella.

00:56.623 --> 00:57.522
Hurry folks, hurry.

00:57.524 --> 01:00.391
That's strange,
everyone carrying umbrellas.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.493
The weather report
didn't mention rain.

01:02.495 --> 01:05.563
Who cares, Jenkins?
It looks like a smash.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.332
- Open the door.
- Yes, sir.

01:18.845 --> 01:22.180
Wait until they open
them umbrellas.

01:29.956 --> 01:33.458
They say there are prizes
for lucky umbrellas.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.960
I smell a hoax, Jenkins.

01:35.962 --> 01:38.196
Devilish. Sinister.

02:02.522 --> 02:06.691
Police! Help! Police!
Help! Police!

02:09.395 --> 02:11.262
A trick umbrella.

02:11.264 --> 02:13.965
As sure as a fingerprint.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.566
The mark of the Penguin.

02:15.568 --> 02:17.702
Correct, Chief O'Hara.
The Penguin.

02:17.704 --> 02:20.305
That pompous, waddling
master of foul play.

02:20.307 --> 02:23.241
A criminal maestro of a thousand
ubiquitous umbrellas.

02:23.243 --> 02:26.611
But I thought he was still up
the river, commissioner.

02:26.613 --> 02:27.312
So did I.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.180
Until I checked
with the penitentiary.

02:29.182 --> 02:32.250
The Penguin was released
three days ago.

02:34.554 --> 02:35.987
Any volunteers, men?

02:35.989 --> 02:38.589
Anyone think he's smart enough
to net the Penguin?

02:38.591 --> 02:43.261
Oh, commissioner,
I speak for us all.

02:43.263 --> 02:44.395
There's but one man living

02:44.397 --> 02:47.966
who can throw the net
over that cagey bird.

02:48.101 --> 02:52.070
Thank you, Chief O'Hara.
I admire your honesty.

02:52.072 --> 02:55.006
And I make it unanimous.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.176
Whoever he may be
behind that mask of his

02:58.178 --> 03:02.146
our only hope
is the caped crusader.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.453

03:18.665 --> 03:21.032
I'll summon him, sir.

03:30.010 --> 03:33.444
Oh, heck. What's the use
of learning French anyway?

03:33.446 --> 03:35.380
Dick, I'm surprised at you.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.016
Language is the key
to world peace.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.417
If we all spoke
each others' tongues

03:39.419 --> 03:43.287
perhaps the scourge of war
would be ended forever.

03:43.289 --> 03:47.625
Gosh, Bruce, yes. I'll get these
darn verbs if they kill me.

03:47.627 --> 03:51.029
Excuse me, sir.
It's the bat-phone, sir.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.230
Yes, Alfred.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.365
Ooh, boy. Let's go.

03:55.101 --> 03:56.634
Mercy me, Dick Grayson.

03:56.636 --> 03:59.704
Where are you going
in such an almighty hurry?

03:59.706 --> 04:02.040
'Gosh, Aunt Harriet,
we just heard'

04:02.042 --> 04:05.376
'the bass are biting again
in White's pond.'

04:05.378 --> 04:06.811
See ya later, Aunt Harriet.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.279
What can I do, Aunt Harriet?

04:08.281 --> 04:11.449
You know how your nephew
is about fishing.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.088
That's funny.

04:17.089 --> 04:22.160
Heard the bass are biting?
Heard from whom?

04:22.295 --> 04:24.162
I cannot tell a lie, madam.

04:24.164 --> 04:27.732
It was myself
who imparted the information.

04:28.501 --> 04:29.267
Yes, commissioner?

04:29.269 --> 04:33.304
Brace yourself for a shock.
It's the Penguin.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.573
We'll be right there.

04:43.316 --> 04:45.383

06:26.787 --> 06:28.053
The umbrellas all went mad

06:28.055 --> 06:30.856
creating the perfect cover
for a holdup.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.325
And yet there was
no holdup, right?

06:33.327 --> 06:33.959
Right as rain, Batman.

06:33.961 --> 06:37.562
The Penguin had everything
set up and then didn't strike.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.930
The old one-two.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.532
Beg pardon, Boy Wonder?

06:40.534 --> 06:42.067
Bam! A feint
at the jewelry store.

06:42.069 --> 06:45.804
To set us up for the real
knockout later on. Zowie!

06:45.806 --> 06:47.773
Robin could be right.

06:47.775 --> 06:48.573
Then again..

06:48.575 --> 06:51.710
I wonder if this whole affair
might just have been

06:51.712 --> 06:53.812
'a harmless practical joke.'

06:53.814 --> 06:54.713
A joke, Batman?

06:54.715 --> 06:57.482
I have great faith in our
prison system, commissioner.

06:57.484 --> 07:01.486
Perhaps the Penguin's spell up
the river has made him reform.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.388
You're dreaming, Batman.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.057
It'll be a sad day
for corkscrews

07:05.059 --> 07:06.792
'when that crooked bird
goes straight.'

07:06.794 --> 07:10.462
Still. I'd like to know
what his state of mind was

07:10.464 --> 07:12.698
when he left prison.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.402
Bonnie, send in
Warden Crichton, will you?

07:17.404 --> 07:19.905
Warden Crichton?
Of state prison? Here?

07:19.907 --> 07:21.940
I anticipated
your question, Batman.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.976
I had him rushed down
by helicopter.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.912
Good morning, good morning.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.114
Warden Crichton,
good to see you.

07:29.116 --> 07:29.981
Warden, the dynamic duo.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.517
- Pleased, I'm sure.
- The honor is ours, Warden.

07:32.519 --> 07:35.754
I've long been a deep admirer
of your fine work

07:35.756 --> 07:36.922
in reforming criminals.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.591
Well, we've had
our little victories.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.426
Our little failures too, alas.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.994
How would you
rate the Penguin?

07:42.996 --> 07:45.831
I'll let you judge that
for yourself, Batman.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.866
- Indeed.
- Judge for myself?

07:47.868 --> 07:49.034
By means of video tape.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.670
It's one of my new
progressive policies, you see.

07:51.672 --> 07:55.140
Before releasing a felon,
I assign him to a special cell

07:55.142 --> 07:58.610
into which is built a secret
television camera.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.679
It enables us
to study the extent

08:00.681 --> 08:03.648
to which he's reformed,
if any.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.784
Warden, you didn't
forget the tape?

08:05.786 --> 08:07.386
I took the liberty
of leaving it

08:07.388 --> 08:09.755
at your communications center
when I arrived.

08:09.757 --> 08:13.058
They're waiting for your signal,
Commissioner Gordon.

08:13.060 --> 08:17.696
Roll Warden Crichton's video
tape on the closed circuit.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.506
Holy haberdashery!

08:27.508 --> 08:29.608
That can't be regulation
prison uniform, can it?

08:29.610 --> 08:32.844
It's another of my progressive
policies, Boy Wonder.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.148
During the last week before
release I permit the prisoners

08:36.150 --> 08:37.649
to wear their own clothing.

08:37.650 --> 08:40.419
It helps acclimate them
to the outside world.

08:40.421 --> 08:42.754
Sound penology, Warden.
Very sound.

08:42.956 --> 08:46.024
Listen! The baleful bird
is about to chirp.

08:46.026 --> 08:50.362
How irritating. Here I am
due to be released tomorrow

08:50.364 --> 08:54.933
and I still haven't worked out
one single crime

08:54.935 --> 08:56.635
worthy of my talents.

08:56.637 --> 09:01.840
My whole stay in this
disgusting prison is wasted.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.976
Yeah. Well, that's the way
it bounces, Penguin.

09:04.978 --> 09:08.146
Some years are just a blind spot
out of a guy's life.

09:08.148 --> 09:11.216
Hey, wait a minute.
My mother-in-law.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.183
'She owns a candy store.'

09:12.185 --> 09:15.253
You could always knock
that over if you wanna.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.321
What? A candy store?

09:16.323 --> 09:19.658
I'm an aristocrat of crookery,
my dear man.

09:19.660 --> 09:25.330
No, I must devise something
royal, unsuspected, sensational.

09:25.332 --> 09:30.402
A keeper that'll make that
Batman blow his brains out.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.671
'Yeah, that Batman.'

09:32.673 --> 09:34.839
'He's sure some kind
of pest, ain't he?'

09:34.841 --> 09:36.408
Say, do you ever
stop to think, Penguin..

09:36.410 --> 09:40.845
If only the Batman was a crook
instead of a law guy.

09:40.847 --> 09:41.880
'Boy, oh, boy.'

09:41.882 --> 09:44.916
'We'd turn his world
inside out.'

09:44.918 --> 09:46.685
What did you say?

09:46.687 --> 09:48.319
Oh, I was just thinking
out loud, Penguin.

09:48.321 --> 09:53.091
I said, if only the Batman
was like us, a crook.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.361
Wait. Wait!

09:56.363 --> 09:59.197
Thoughts swingin'.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.399
Oh, great heavenly sunshades.

10:01.401 --> 10:05.937
I have it!
It's fantastical scheme.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.274
It's hatched full blown.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.042
U-day.

10:11.044 --> 10:14.112
U for Umbrella day.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.113
Oh, what a dazzling plot.

10:15.115 --> 10:19.084
Hold it, Penguin, hold it.
Look up there.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.953
Behind that phony spider web.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.755
Ooh, yes.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.524
Secret TV eyes..

10:25.526 --> 10:27.225
Well, goodnight, big brother.

10:27.227 --> 10:32.531
Yes, I'm afraid you'll have to
unravel the rest of my plot

10:32.533 --> 10:34.533
by yourself!

10:39.606 --> 10:41.106
Any thoughts, Batman?

10:41.108 --> 10:44.209
On the whole, I think
we'd better discard my theory

10:44.211 --> 10:46.811
about the Penguin's
going straight.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.613
Where did I go wrong?

10:48.615 --> 10:52.117
Why did my
progressive policies fail?

10:52.119 --> 10:53.285
With an attitude like his

10:53.287 --> 10:55.320
I'm amazed he was
turned loose at all.

10:55.322 --> 10:59.291
Uh, Warden. Ours is a rule
of law, Boy Wonder.

10:59.293 --> 11:02.994
When a man has paid his debt
to society, he must be released.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.932
Gosh, yes. That was a pretty
dumb remark of mine.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.066
Don't fret about it, old man.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.502
The important thing is to get on
the Penguins trail fast.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.005
I'll put out
a four points Bulletin.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.040
Wait. I've got a better idea.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.275
'Yes?'

11:17.277 --> 11:19.744
The Penguin told us
on that secret tape.

11:19.746 --> 11:23.715
Whatever his dazzling plot is,
it involves umbrellas.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.350
- So, he'll need a front.
- Right.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.585
Quickly, commissioner,
send for the city records.

11:27.587 --> 11:30.588
Let's find out if anyone's
opened an umbrella factory

11:30.590 --> 11:32.757
in the last three days.

11:38.199 --> 11:39.565
Three new
umbrella factories.

11:39.967 --> 11:43.369
None of them unfortunately,
in the name of Penguin.

11:43.371 --> 11:46.105
It's a dead end.

11:46.107 --> 11:48.274
Could he be using an alias?

11:48.276 --> 11:49.175
Good thinking, Robin.

11:49.477 --> 11:52.644
Chief, read me the names of
those umbrella factory licenses.

11:52.646 --> 11:56.883
Here's RL Howard,
KG Bird, EP Sherlock.

11:56.885 --> 11:58.051
Bird?

11:58.053 --> 11:59.752
K-G Bird.

11:59.754 --> 12:00.953
Cagey bird!

12:00.955 --> 12:01.754
The Penguin! Get it?

12:01.956 --> 12:03.890
Get it? Why, it's practically
transparent.

12:03.892 --> 12:07.994
Address.
196 West, Seventh Avenue.

12:07.996 --> 12:10.162
Let's go.

12:14.668 --> 12:18.570
<i> Meanwhile, atop</i>
<i> the umbrella factory</i>

12:18.572 --> 12:21.773
<i> we find the sinister</i>
<i> secret headquarters</i>

12:21.775 --> 12:27.813
<i> of the rascally penguin</i>
<i> and his fine feathered finks.</i>

12:28.983 --> 12:35.787
The most fantastic gimmick
in my whole criminal career.

12:37.024 --> 12:37.889
Yeah.

12:37.891 --> 12:41.593
Hmm, now, I wonder
what time it is.

12:42.963 --> 12:47.799
At the signal the time
will be precisely 11:56.

12:51.405 --> 12:55.741
Now, Hawkeye, give the go ahead
to swoop at the bank.

12:55.743 --> 12:57.743
Okay, boss.

13:00.281 --> 13:04.283
Maybe, I'm dumb, Penguin,
but I don't dig this caper.

13:04.285 --> 13:06.418
Oh, it's very simple,
my little gosling.

13:06.420 --> 13:10.489
I'm going to unleash
the most bizarre, senseless

13:10.491 --> 13:13.625
barrage of umbrellas
onto Gotham City.

13:13.627 --> 13:18.563
It'll be senseless to everybody,
but the Batman.

13:18.565 --> 13:21.033
Whose keen mind
will unquestionably

13:21.035 --> 13:25.637
piece together
the clues to my crime.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.905
Well, what crime?

13:26.907 --> 13:29.975
What the heck
are you planning?

13:29.977 --> 13:31.009
Nothing.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.044
Nothing?

13:32.046 --> 13:33.545
Nothing?

13:33.981 --> 13:35.580
What do you mean, nothing?

13:35.582 --> 13:37.416
I am planning nothing.

13:37.418 --> 13:39.718
The Batman's
gonna do that for me.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.521
The Batman's not only
going to pick my crime

13:42.523 --> 13:45.557
he is going to provide me
with a blueprint

13:45.559 --> 13:47.392
as to how I should pull it off.

13:47.394 --> 13:50.796
Are you sure
you haven't gone stir crazy?

13:50.798 --> 13:53.532
Why, you, birdbrain.

13:53.667 --> 13:57.102
How dare you mock me on the eve
of my greatest triumph.

13:57.104 --> 14:01.039
Do you really mean the Batman's
gonna plan our caper?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.642
Yes, my fine feathered finks.

14:03.644 --> 14:06.778
It's a little plot
I hatched in prison.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.380
Wait and see.

14:08.382 --> 14:10.482
The Batman and the Penguin

14:10.484 --> 14:14.720
are going to be
partners in plunder.

14:15.856 --> 14:16.655
<i> What's that?</i>

14:16.657 --> 14:19.925
<i> Batman and the Penguin</i>
<i> partners in plunder?</i>

14:19.927 --> 14:24.029
<i> Someone must have flipped</i>
<i> his fine feathered wig.</i>

14:26.467 --> 14:27.700
Yes, commissioner?

14:27.702 --> 14:29.168
A patrolman had just called in.

14:29.170 --> 14:32.404
There's another man giving away
free umbrellas, Boy Wonder.

14:32.406 --> 14:34.707
Outside the bank,
at Jefferson and 12th.

14:34.709 --> 14:35.408
Roger.

14:35.410 --> 14:36.876
Bank. Jefferson and 12th.

14:37.078 --> 14:39.612
Hold tight. Bat-turn.

14:56.230 --> 14:57.863
Stay calm, citizens.

14:57.865 --> 14:58.964
Give us your umbrellas, quickly.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.299
Robin, officer,
gather the umbrellas

15:00.301 --> 15:03.469
put them in that
large wire basket.

15:04.572 --> 15:08.374
Cover the basket with
the asbestos pad, officer.

15:22.456 --> 15:25.457
Strange. There's no one
heading for the door.

15:25.459 --> 15:28.194
True. And they don't
look like gangsters.

15:28.196 --> 15:30.262
But it's just like
the jewelry shop.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.431
A perfect setup
and no robbery.

15:32.433 --> 15:33.966
What in heck
is the Penguin's game?

15:33.968 --> 15:38.070
I don't know. But more than
ever I want to have a chat

15:38.072 --> 15:40.239
with that cagey little bird.

15:49.450 --> 15:55.254
"Senseless bank caper completed.
Batman on way."

15:55.256 --> 15:57.256
Signed Swoop.

15:57.258 --> 16:01.293
I'll just send in

16:04.899 --> 16:07.166
Take this and attach it
to the handle

16:07.168 --> 16:09.168
of the decoy in the launcher.

16:09.170 --> 16:11.403
Wait for my signal.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.186
What's the plot, Penguin?

16:27.188 --> 16:33.092
Oh, the dynamic duo.
Such distinguished customers.

16:33.094 --> 16:35.027
May I show you
my humble wares.

16:35.029 --> 16:38.063
We're not here to buy
umbrellas and you know it.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.065
Spread your wings,
Mr. KG Bird.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.401
We're flying you
down to headquarters.

16:42.403 --> 16:45.271
On what charge, Boy Wonder?

16:45.273 --> 16:46.071
Illegal umbrellas.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.007
Assault and battery,
disturbing the peace.

16:48.009 --> 16:51.644
We've got enough to put you
back on ice, Penguin.

16:51.646 --> 16:53.646
Oh, tut-tut, Batman.

16:53.648 --> 16:55.014
I only make the umbrellas.

16:55.016 --> 16:59.318
What they do after they leave
here is hardly my affair.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.587
Now, is it?

17:02.957 --> 17:05.089
A tricky little creature.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.125
He's right.

17:06.127 --> 17:08.694
Darn it! Not a thing
to hold him on.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.930
- Yet.
- Beg pardon?

17:10.932 --> 17:12.564
Were you saying something?

17:12.566 --> 17:15.334
You've outsmarted us
this time, Penguin.

17:15.336 --> 17:16.702
But don't get too confident.

17:16.704 --> 17:19.438
We know you're up to
some super-crime.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.675
'And we're going to watch you.'

17:59.113 --> 18:01.313
Better warn the bystanders.

18:01.315 --> 18:02.314
Right.

18:02.316 --> 18:04.450
Back everyone. Back!

18:04.452 --> 18:08.087
Take cover!
It could be explosive.

18:16.364 --> 18:17.496
- Wow!
- Curious.

18:17.498 --> 18:19.999
It looks like an ordinary
umbrella except

18:20.001 --> 18:21.266
for it's unusual size.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.136
Look up there, Batman!
Hanging from the handle.

18:24.138 --> 18:25.604
I bet my life
on it, Robin

18:25.606 --> 18:27.639
this could be a clue
to the Penguin's game.

18:27.641 --> 18:31.377
- Only how to get at it?
- Easy. I'll use the bat-rope.

18:31.379 --> 18:36.048
You run around, grab the edge of
this huge umbrella, study it.

18:36.050 --> 18:37.449
Roger.

18:53.768 --> 18:57.236
Careful, Batman.
Easy does it.

18:58.539 --> 19:01.440
This is a tricky one alright.

19:01.442 --> 19:02.741
Careful!

19:04.745 --> 19:06.412
I got it.

19:09.450 --> 19:12.151
Look. There's a silver plaque
on the handle.

19:12.153 --> 19:15.187
"Special bat-brella.
Compliments of K. G. Bird."

19:15.189 --> 19:17.623
Maker of superior umbrellas.

19:17.625 --> 19:18.524
It's a clue alright.

19:18.526 --> 19:21.393
- But what does it mean?
- To the bat-cave.

19:21.395 --> 19:23.395
We'll analyze it.

19:23.798 --> 19:26.065
Carry on, officers.

19:43.717 --> 19:46.218
- Alfred!
- Sir?

19:46.220 --> 19:47.219
Be careful.

19:47.221 --> 19:48.787
Not to worry, Master Robin.

19:48.789 --> 19:51.757
The safety lock is operative.

19:55.196 --> 19:56.795
Don't worry about
Alfred, old man.

19:56.797 --> 19:59.865
- Let's get to this bat-brella.
- Right.

20:02.103 --> 20:04.870
I'll give you
a bit of fabric.

20:04.872 --> 20:07.272
I'll take a rib.

20:20.321 --> 20:21.687
Any luck with that fabric?

20:21.689 --> 20:24.256
Negative. No secret
writing of any sort.

20:24.258 --> 20:26.592
It's the same with
my section of the rib.

20:26.594 --> 20:29.428
This bat-brella's made
of perfectly ordinary

20:29.430 --> 20:30.829
chrome magnesium alloy.

20:30.831 --> 20:33.499
The Penguin sure must
be having a laugh, Batman.

20:33.501 --> 20:37.169
He's given us a clue to his plot
and we can't solve it.

20:37.171 --> 20:40.272
If only we had some way
of spying on him.

20:40.274 --> 20:41.840
Well, that's it, Robin.

20:41.842 --> 20:43.275
You've done it again.

20:43.277 --> 20:46.245
- No kidding?
- Look, listen.

20:51.719 --> 20:54.686
'Electronic bugging devices.'

20:56.257 --> 20:59.358
A perfect, lifelike spider.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.560
Right. Only it's not a spider.

21:01.562 --> 21:02.394
It's a tiny microphone

21:02.396 --> 21:04.596
'with a built-in super power
transmitter.'

21:04.598 --> 21:07.166
Exactly. I'm going
to take it..

21:07.168 --> 21:09.835
...and drop it
in the Penguin's shop.

21:09.837 --> 21:12.804
We'll listen in
to his crooked scheming.

21:12.806 --> 21:15.207
It's a great idea, Batman, but..

21:15.209 --> 21:17.309
...how'll you get away
with planting it?

21:17.311 --> 21:18.777
Won't he be
on guard against you?

21:18.779 --> 21:21.713
Of course. He'll be
on guard against Batman.

21:21.715 --> 21:26.351
That's why I'm going to visit
his shop as Bruce Wayne.

21:42.504 --> 21:44.570
Good day, sir.
Can I help you, sir?

21:44.572 --> 21:46.572
- I hope so, Mr. Bird.
- Mm-hmm.

21:46.574 --> 21:47.607
I'm looking for an artisan

21:47.609 --> 21:49.909
to repair this
fine old umbrella.

21:49.911 --> 21:51.043
It belonged to my late father.

21:51.045 --> 21:53.813
Oh, yes, quality goods,
I can tell at a glance.

21:53.815 --> 21:56.549
Just let me study it
for a moment, please.

21:56.551 --> 21:59.585
Oh, please. By all means.

22:20.175 --> 22:24.777
Well, it's fortunate
that I equipped my shop

22:24.779 --> 22:28.781
with an automatic
anti-bugging machine.

22:34.689 --> 22:36.889
- Who is he, Boss?
- I have no idea.

22:36.891 --> 22:39.025
Some rival
umbrella king, perhaps.

22:39.027 --> 22:41.794
Trying to steal
my precious secrets.

22:41.796 --> 22:45.832
It's a clear case
of industrial espionage.

22:45.834 --> 22:49.635
Why, the wretched,
blundering fool.

22:49.637 --> 22:52.004
See this.

22:54.509 --> 22:57.477
But whoever he is,
one thing is certain.

22:57.479 --> 23:02.014
I can't afford to have him
snooping around here today.

23:02.016 --> 23:02.882
Today of all days

23:02.884 --> 23:07.653
when I'm about to deal Batman
his greatest blow.

23:07.655 --> 23:09.021
The river, boss?

23:09.023 --> 23:10.756
No, the furnace.

23:10.758 --> 23:12.558
The tempering furnace.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.595
Where we forge
the umbrella ribs.

23:15.597 --> 23:19.632
Take him away,
my fine feathered finks.

23:19.634 --> 23:21.834
And arrange a fatal accident.

23:21.836 --> 23:24.237
Without witnesses.

23:37.685 --> 23:40.286
Pull the net down
real tight.

23:40.288 --> 23:40.920
Done.

23:40.922 --> 23:43.589
- Ain't it a shame?
- Ain't what a shame?

23:43.591 --> 23:46.626
Ain't it a shame
it ain't the Batman.

24:02.944 --> 24:05.978
<i> Oh, the irony of it.</i>

24:07.048 --> 24:09.749
<i> The horror!</i>

24:13.087 --> 24:16.856
<i> The flaming end</i>
<i> of the caped crusader.</i>

24:18.560 --> 24:21.127
<i> Can Bruce possibly escape?</i>

24:21.129 --> 24:22.028
<i> For Batman's sake!</i>

24:22.030 --> 24:25.231
<i> Keep your bat fingers crossed</i>
<i> until tomorrow.</i>

24:25.233 --> 24:28.100
<i> Same time! Same channel!</i>
