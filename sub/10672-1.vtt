00:12.145 --> 00:16.148
Hmm. Please acquire
a fin-bearing sea-dweller.

00:17.417 --> 00:19.251
Oh. Go fish.

00:24.157 --> 00:25.758
( sighs )

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:35.168 --> 00:37.770
And the flanking action
allowed us to rout

00:37.772 --> 00:40.205
the Decepticon forces.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.274
Amazing.
Tell us another.

00:42.276 --> 00:45.210
Ugh, give it a rest,
will you, Strongarm?

00:45.212 --> 00:47.112
You bugging Pops
for war stories

00:47.114 --> 00:49.815
is getting older than,
well, Pops.

00:51.484 --> 00:53.318
Sideswipe, you'd better
watch your--

00:53.320 --> 00:57.723
Young Bot, you may call me
Optimus Prime or Optimus.

00:57.725 --> 01:02.361
Those are your only options,
understood?

01:02.363 --> 01:03.595
Yes, sir.

01:03.597 --> 01:06.698
And I'm not bugging Optimus.
I'm leaving.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.834
You should try it sometime.
Soon.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.669
You're not the boss of me.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.504
Someone has to be.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.640
( both grunt )

01:14.642 --> 01:16.708
SIDESWIPE:
What? Don't--

01:16.710 --> 01:18.343
( laughter )

01:18.345 --> 01:19.711
( both cheer )

01:19.713 --> 01:21.547
( grunting continuous )

01:23.183 --> 01:26.618
Okay, Slick, Cadet,
cease fire before...

01:26.620 --> 01:28.120
Whoa!

01:29.589 --> 01:30.789
( both gasp )

01:32.559 --> 01:35.427
Sideswipe, Strongarm,
be careful.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.697
It wasn't easy capturing
those Cyclone Mini-Cons.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.867
( grunting continuous )

01:41.869 --> 01:43.435
SIDESWIPE:
Come on!

01:47.707 --> 01:50.676
Ugh. Grimlock, would you please
break them up?

01:52.879 --> 01:55.180
( roars )

01:57.617 --> 01:58.817
Grim.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.725

Get him off me! Get him off me!

02:35.623 --> 02:37.556
Aah!

02:37.558 --> 02:39.191
Optimus Prime,

02:39.193 --> 02:41.793
now that your battle
with Megatronus is over,

02:41.795 --> 02:43.896
you must return those portions
of the Sparks

02:43.898 --> 02:46.198
your fellow Primes lent you.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.433
I understand.

02:48.435 --> 02:52.271
Wait. Optimus told us the first
transfer almost destroyed him.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.672
How do we know
the reversal won't--?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.908
This isn't a Q&A session,
Botling.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.809
Commence reversal.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.618
( screams )

03:08.655 --> 03:10.889
Stop! You're tearing him apart!

03:14.594 --> 03:15.827
Aah!

03:15.829 --> 03:17.462
Whoa!

03:19.566 --> 03:21.233
( screaming )

03:25.939 --> 03:28.473
Optimus, are you
all right?

03:28.475 --> 03:29.808
( groans )

03:29.810 --> 03:33.745
I am...alive, Bumblebee.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.280
Barely.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.216
You took too much
of his power.

03:38.451 --> 03:40.385
( computerized beeping )

03:44.224 --> 03:47.359
My scan indicates
Optimus will recover.

03:47.361 --> 03:51.296
My scan indicates Optimus'
levels are dangerously low.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.931
When will Optimus recover?

03:52.933 --> 03:54.766
Weeks? Months?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.802
Only time knows the answer.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.670
That isn't helpful.

04:01.641 --> 04:04.743
Is he gone?
Please, tell me he's gone!

04:07.347 --> 04:08.814
Whew!

04:08.816 --> 04:12.017
Well, Optimus might not
feel better, but I sure do.

04:12.019 --> 04:15.621
My physical condition
is of no consequence.

04:15.623 --> 04:18.656
Let us continue
our mission.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.826
Optimus, you should
take it easy.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.661
I am functional.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.429
And if I am functional,

04:24.431 --> 04:27.499
then I am capable
of assisting as I heal.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.505
He's about as weak
as a frayed fan belt.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.941
I'll snap you in two if you
don't stop that kind of talk.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.446
If Optimus says he can help,
he can help.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.383
Regardless, it's been weeks
since we defeated Megatronus.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.752
We need to get back
to capturing Decepticons.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.688
And stop fighting
with each other.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.392
Now, most of the Alchemor's
fugitives

04:53.394 --> 04:54.826
have been centered
near the Scrapyard,

04:54.828 --> 04:56.528
but Windblade's told us
there are others

04:56.530 --> 04:57.796
scattered all over
the world.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.065
On which region
do we focus?

05:00.067 --> 05:01.800
All of them.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.735
Drift, you and your Mini-Cons,
along with Windblade,

05:03.737 --> 05:06.305
will concentrate
on distant Decepticons.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.673
Your stealth and speed
should allow you

05:07.675 --> 05:08.974
to cover
substantial ground.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.776
Then I'm going with them.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.045
With me on board,
we'll have any 'Cons we find

05:13.047 --> 05:15.347
rounded up before
Russell's lunchtime.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.949
You just want to be
wherever Windblade is.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.752
Don't put me in the middle
of your little psychodrama.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.888
You've got it all wrong.

05:22.890 --> 05:26.391
I just want to be
wherever you aren't.

05:26.393 --> 05:27.759
( both growl )

05:27.761 --> 05:28.960
Enough!

05:28.962 --> 05:33.365
Sideswipe, if you want
to go, go.

05:33.367 --> 05:34.766
Yes!

05:34.768 --> 05:36.368
Strongarm,
Grimlock and I

05:36.370 --> 05:38.003
will continue to operate
from the Scrapyard,

05:38.005 --> 05:40.072
with Denny and Russell's
assistance.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.675
Optimus, with Fixit's help,

05:43.677 --> 05:45.544
will track and coordinate
all of our missions

05:45.546 --> 05:48.113
from the Command Center.
OPTIMUS: No, Bumblebee.

05:48.115 --> 05:52.050
I believe I would be most
helpful leading your field team.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.119
With all due respect, sir...

05:54.121 --> 05:56.755
You're kind of gonna
slow us down.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.491
You were built for neither
speed nor stealth.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.927
And we don't want to see you
get hurt.

06:01.929 --> 06:06.531
Your concern is appreciated,
but unwarranted.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.434
Optimus Prime will lead
the Away Team.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.837
Fixit, resume scanning
and widen the vectors.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.105
Let's see if we can pick up

06:13.107 --> 06:15.107
a remote Decepticon signal
somewhere.

06:15.109 --> 06:17.709
And rig up a portable tracker
for the Away Team to use.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.044
Yes, sir.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.545
I shall assist

06:20.547 --> 06:21.947
with the construction
of the tracker.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.950
You've had some wonky ideas,
Bee,

06:24.952 --> 06:27.919
but putting Optimus
in charge of us? That's--

06:27.921 --> 06:30.989
None of us is gonna be able
to make Optimus change his mind.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.524
Let him lead
as best he can,

06:32.526 --> 06:33.925
and try to position him
where his condition

06:33.927 --> 06:35.660
can't jeopardize
your missions.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.529
At least until
his strength returns.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.398
How?

06:39.400 --> 06:41.533
Suggest he hang back,
to coordinate communications

06:41.535 --> 06:42.968
or formulate strategy.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.403
You know,
something like that.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.670
( sighs ):
Okay.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.406
But only if I get to come up

06:47.408 --> 06:50.609
with a cooler name for us
than the "Away Team."

06:50.611 --> 06:52.043
FIXIT:
Lieutenant.

06:53.846 --> 06:57.549
Decepticon signal located
at the Arctic Circle.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.917
The Arctic Circle.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.420
The cold will impede
our systems.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.156
We must capture
our quarry quickly.

07:04.158 --> 07:06.625
I'll program the coordinates
into the Ground Bridge.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.160
Looks like you're up,
Away Team.

07:08.162 --> 07:11.897
You mean
"Bad Bot Bashers."

07:11.899 --> 07:13.565
Huh?

07:13.567 --> 07:15.901
Right?

07:15.903 --> 07:17.502
Come on.

07:18.971 --> 07:20.672
I'm just warming up.

07:25.545 --> 07:30.482
My friends, let us venture forth
on this new mission,

07:30.484 --> 07:32.551
and let us claim victory

07:32.553 --> 07:35.987
for Cybertron
and for Earth.

07:40.693 --> 07:41.893
( sighs )

07:41.895 --> 07:43.094
( grunts ):
Ow!

07:44.831 --> 07:46.164
Forward.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.999
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

07:54.207 --> 07:56.041
Is this really
a good idea, sir?

07:56.043 --> 07:57.476
They'll be fine.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.914

Whoa!

08:28.841 --> 08:30.876
( sighs )

08:32.211 --> 08:34.880
Look at the bright side:
the fire's out,

08:34.881 --> 08:37.749
and you can skip
your bath tonight.

08:39.118 --> 08:39.618
( sighs )

08:44.190 --> 08:47.626
Command Center to Away Team,
do you read?

08:49.061 --> 08:51.897
Away Team,
can you read me?

08:51.899 --> 08:54.299
For all I know, their molecules
could have been scattered

08:54.301 --> 08:56.134
from here to Cabraxas IV.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.837
Or they could have materialized
inside a meteor, or--

08:58.839 --> 09:00.839
Fixit, stay calm.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.040
Keep trying.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.241
Right.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.643
Away Team, this is--

09:04.645 --> 09:05.844
OPTIMUS:
<i>This is Optimus Prime,</i>

09:05.846 --> 09:07.045
<i>Command Center.</i>

09:07.047 --> 09:09.014
( wind gusting )

09:11.717 --> 09:14.719
We have reached
the Arctic Circle.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.088
We are at the base
of an ice mountain...

09:17.090 --> 09:20.659
near some manner
of research installation.

09:24.196 --> 09:25.964
Is everything okay
back there?

09:25.966 --> 09:28.333
We heard strange noises
as we came through the portal.

09:28.335 --> 09:31.937
We had a slight malfunction
of the Ground Bridge.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.905
( sizzling )

09:35.908 --> 09:39.010
My theory is that something
in the Primes' reversal process

09:39.012 --> 09:41.146
altered your basic chemistry,
Optimus.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.647
When you went through
the portal,

09:42.649 --> 09:43.949
you affected
the Ground Bridge

09:43.951 --> 09:45.984
the same way a magnet
damages a lard chive--

09:45.986 --> 09:49.154
Card five-- Hard drive.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.156
In other words, you're not
taking a shortcut home

09:51.158 --> 09:53.291
until we get the
Ground Bridge fixed.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.294
Understood. Optimus out.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.897
I shall scan
for our quarry.

09:58.899 --> 10:02.100
Remain here and prepare
yourselves for battle,

10:02.102 --> 10:04.970
should there be one.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.338
Did I call it?

10:06.340 --> 10:08.707
Optimus is already
messing us up.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.008
It'll take us forever

10:10.010 --> 10:11.710
to drive back
to the Scrapyard from here.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.211
Cut him some cable,
Slick.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.814
It wasn't his fault
the Ground Bridge fritzed.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.383
According to the scanner,
the Decepticon's signal

10:18.385 --> 10:20.852
is emanating
from that cave.

10:24.357 --> 10:27.225
Travel up the mountain
will not be easy,

10:27.227 --> 10:28.927
but-- Aah!

10:30.096 --> 10:32.330
Are you injured,
Optimus Prime?

10:32.332 --> 10:34.966
I am fine, Drift.

10:38.704 --> 10:40.005
Ugh!

10:42.842 --> 10:44.943
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

10:51.651 --> 10:54.319
Grimlock, please help me
gently separate

10:54.321 --> 10:56.087
the pieces
of the Ground Bridge.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.823
We must determine which
components remain operational.

11:04.363 --> 11:06.698
( grunts )

11:06.700 --> 11:08.233
( roars )

11:10.803 --> 11:12.937
I said gently!

11:12.939 --> 11:15.440
That was my gently.

11:15.442 --> 11:20.945
Bee, are you sure it was wise
to split your team like this?

11:20.947 --> 11:23.748
Specifically, sir,
was it wise

11:23.750 --> 11:27.419
to separate those of us
who wield Decepticon Hunters?

11:27.421 --> 11:30.722
Fair point. And I do worry about
jeopardizing the chemistry

11:30.724 --> 11:32.390
we've built
since we've been here.

11:32.392 --> 11:35.160
But I can't send Grimlock
on an extended field mission.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.998
He's too hard to disguise.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.367
And we can't just fight
Decepticon activity here

11:42.369 --> 11:43.902
when we have every reason
to believe

11:43.904 --> 11:45.737
there are fugitives
all over the globe.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.205
Solid reasoning, sir.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.441
I just hope neither team
encounters anything

11:49.443 --> 11:52.010
that will make you
regret your decision.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.079
( heavy footsteps )

11:54.081 --> 11:56.247
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

12:06.425 --> 12:10.028
Please, please,
keep your seats.

12:10.030 --> 12:14.165
And bring Optimus Prime
to me now.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.735
Overload?

12:16.737 --> 12:19.237
( sirens blaring )

12:21.741 --> 12:23.942
Denny, Russell,
get to safety.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.410
Way ahead of you, Bee!

12:25.412 --> 12:27.846
Shut down the Scrapyard's
defense systems.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.748
FIXIT:
You don't have to tell me twice.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.755
You almost look familiar.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.958
But I've performed
before so many.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.326
( growls )

12:43.162 --> 12:45.029
When I awoke from stasis,

12:45.031 --> 12:48.767
I sensed Optimus' energy
signature here.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.503
He stole my spotlight
so long ago

12:51.505 --> 12:53.304
in our first encounter.

12:53.306 --> 12:57.342
But the sequel
shall be very different.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.977
( roars )

12:58.979 --> 13:01.212
( grunts )
Whoa!

13:08.921 --> 13:12.257
Oh, you're looking
to take center stage.

13:12.259 --> 13:15.093
Well, you're not
the star here.

13:16.095 --> 13:17.862
You're not even an extra.

13:17.864 --> 13:19.798
( grunting )

13:20.900 --> 13:22.267
Watch the face.

13:22.269 --> 13:25.069
The face is an actor's fortune,
you know.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.073
( grunting )

13:35.147 --> 13:37.282
Hi. I'm Grimlock,

13:37.284 --> 13:40.885
the Dinobot who's gonna
rearrange your pistons.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.387
Is that right?

13:42.389 --> 13:45.190
Exit Grimlock,
stage left.

13:46.192 --> 13:47.826
( screams )

13:54.033 --> 13:55.400
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

13:59.538 --> 14:01.906
( wind gusting )

14:01.908 --> 14:03.842
( panting )

14:05.611 --> 14:08.446
Hey, Optimus, if the cold
is slowing you down,

14:08.448 --> 14:10.548
why don't you just
go back and, uh,

14:10.550 --> 14:12.483
coordinate communications
for us?

14:12.485 --> 14:14.219
What Sideswipe means, sir,

14:14.221 --> 14:16.421
is that you're too valuable
to be up here.

14:16.423 --> 14:19.324
I agree. If you relocate
to the bottom of the mountain,

14:19.326 --> 14:21.359
you could hold your strength
in reserve

14:21.361 --> 14:23.494
in case we encounter
difficulty.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.597
That's not exactly
what I was--

14:25.599 --> 14:28.466
That might well be
a prudent suggestion.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.034
Perhaps I--

14:32.104 --> 14:33.404
Aah!

14:45.050 --> 14:46.918
( snarling )

14:54.159 --> 14:55.960
Found our Decepticon.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.328
But unless he runs out
of ice,

14:57.330 --> 15:00.098
we're gonna be stuck here
for a while.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.200
That is not acceptable.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.273
( groans )

15:08.275 --> 15:09.607
Continue up the mountain.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.676
I will provide cover.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.345
Optimus, you are
too exposed.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.014
( grunts )

15:16.016 --> 15:17.282
Do not argue.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.583
You must continue
up the mountain--

15:18.585 --> 15:19.984
Aah!

15:25.157 --> 15:27.258
(<i> action theme playing</i> )

15:28.627 --> 15:30.395
Optimus!

15:35.501 --> 15:38.036
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

15:38.038 --> 15:39.570
( grunting )

15:41.240 --> 15:43.975
Hang on, Optimus.
We'll come get you.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.543
Okay, how are we
gonna go get him?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.378
I can't carry Optimus
in jet mode.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.080
He's too heavy for me.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.549
Have your Mini-Cons give Optimus
something to stand on.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.319
I'll see if I can take the
pressure off for a little while.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.988
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

16:07.633 --> 16:10.068
Right. I'll wait here.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.315
( groaning )

16:24.317 --> 16:26.584
SLIPSTREAM:
Rest your weight upon us,
Optimus.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.519
JETSTORM:
Not all of it, perhaps.

16:30.055 --> 16:31.656
( grunting )

16:31.658 --> 16:34.659
SLIPSTREAM ( straining ):
Light as a feather.

16:36.695 --> 16:38.363
JETSTORM:
Uh-oh.

16:43.102 --> 16:44.769
( both chattering )

16:52.344 --> 16:55.580
Fixit, it sounded like
Bee knows this 'Con.

16:55.582 --> 16:56.781
He should.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.250
( electronic beeping )

17:06.090 --> 17:07.724
During the War for Cybertron,

17:07.727 --> 17:10.127
Overload was the Decepticons'
top spy.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.729
He assumed many identities,

17:11.731 --> 17:13.765
and fancied himself
a brilliant actor.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.566
Overload's work
led to the destruction

17:15.568 --> 17:17.402
of several
Autobot installations,

17:17.404 --> 17:18.736
until Optimus learned
of the treachery

17:18.738 --> 17:20.471
and put an end to it.

17:20.473 --> 17:23.074
But Overload badly injured
Optimus's rookie scout

17:23.076 --> 17:24.409
in the battle.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.411
Bumblebee.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.479
( groaning )

17:28.481 --> 17:31.582
Let me give you
your cue one last time.

17:33.352 --> 17:36.354
Where is Optimus?

17:36.356 --> 17:38.456
He's gone.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.291
( moans )

17:40.293 --> 17:42.427
( grunts )

17:42.429 --> 17:45.063
OVERLOAD:
Oh, amateurs.

17:46.765 --> 17:49.400
( Grimlock grunting )

17:52.571 --> 17:54.539
But wait.

17:54.541 --> 17:58.676
Why am I concerning myself
with mere understudies?

17:58.678 --> 18:01.079
Optimus is who I want.

18:02.581 --> 18:07.085
Optimus always felt protective
of innocent bit players.

18:08.487 --> 18:11.389
And this world
is full of them.

18:11.391 --> 18:14.158
If I crush
those bit players,

18:14.160 --> 18:16.527
Optimus will come running.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.329
And I'll be waiting.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.098
( laughs maniacally )

18:26.872 --> 18:29.107
( both chatter )

18:31.877 --> 18:33.711
(<i> techno theme playing</i> )

18:43.122 --> 18:45.156
STRONGARM:
Hate to say it, Lieutenant,

18:45.158 --> 18:46.757
but Overload seems
to have the armor

18:46.759 --> 18:49.160
to stand up
to our entire team.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.896
It didn't look like he had
as much armor on his face.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.598
He thinks he's an actor.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.434
Probably doesn't want
to hide his "good looks."

18:56.436 --> 18:58.803
Maybe if we had
Sideswipe, Drift and--

18:58.805 --> 19:02.440
"Maybe" doesn't matter.
I'm taking that Decepticon down.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.841
With our help.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.710
Before he hurts anyone else.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.745
Fixit, continue
Ground Bridge repairs

19:07.747 --> 19:09.380
while I go after
Overload.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.182
We have another concern.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.850
Ransack and Backtrack
are moose--

19:12.852 --> 19:15.186
Goose-- Loose!

19:15.188 --> 19:17.588
Stopping Overload
is my priority right now.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.891
We'll add the Mini-Cons
to our "to-do" list.

19:19.893 --> 19:22.193
Lieutenant,
we're going too, right?

19:22.195 --> 19:23.794
Oh. Of course.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.731
Come on, team,
let's rev up and roll out.

19:27.933 --> 19:30.334
( tires screech )

19:30.336 --> 19:33.538
Bee's taking this
way too personally.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.206
You noticed, huh?

19:35.208 --> 19:37.408
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

19:48.820 --> 19:51.355
( tree rustling )

19:51.357 --> 19:53.357
( Ransack and Backtrack
chittering and humming )

20:08.407 --> 20:10.341
Hail and well met,

20:10.343 --> 20:13.211
small doers
of great destruction.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.879
BOTH:
Uh...huh?

20:14.881 --> 20:19.250
Care to audition
for my supporting cast?

20:21.954 --> 20:24.555
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

20:26.692 --> 20:29.493
And action!

20:40.472 --> 20:41.872
( grunts )

20:41.874 --> 20:43.774
( laughs )

20:55.887 --> 20:57.488
Showtime.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.857
