WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.968
<i> PREVIOUSLY</i>
<i> ON</i> PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:02.970 --> 00:04.236
Ali:<i> I SEE YOU!</i>
<i> WHO WAS IT?</i>

00:04.238 --> 00:05.904
<i> IT WAS THAT PERV,</i>
<i> TOBY CAVANAUGH.</i>

00:05.906 --> 00:07.740
AND I'LL MAKE SURE
EVERYBODY KNOWS.

00:07.742 --> 00:11.210
THE COPS TOOK HANNA
TO THE POLICE STATION TODAY.

00:11.212 --> 00:14.146
YOU DON'T THINK SHE'D EVER
TALK ABOUT...
THE JENNA THING?

00:14.148 --> 00:15.681
WE MADE A PROMISE.

00:15.683 --> 00:19.284
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S JENNA.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.720
WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE
HOLDING ONTO, IT'S GOT TO STOP.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.856
( gasping )
I THINK HE'S DANGEROUS.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.324
AND I THINK
YOU NEED HELP.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.393
YOU KNOW WHAT, MELISSA...

00:27.395 --> 00:29.528
SPENCER,
WE'RE PREGNANT.

00:29.530 --> 00:33.599
<i> I SAW A PHOTO</i>
<i> ON YOUR WEBSITE PAGE</i>

00:33.601 --> 00:35.067
<i> OF YOU AND JACKIE.</i>

00:35.069 --> 00:36.535
<i> WHY DID YOU BREAK IT OFF?</i>

00:36.537 --> 00:38.437
I DIDN'T.
SHE DID.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.239
<i> I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE</i>
<i> BREAKING UP WITH ME,</i>

00:40.241 --> 00:41.840
BUT WE WERE NEVER
REALLY TOGETHER.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.342
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.244
<i> AND I THINK YOU DESERVE</i>
<i> A BETTER BOYFRIEND.</i>

00:45.246 --> 00:47.513
<i> YOU DID THIS FOR MONEY?</i>
<i> JENNA OFFERED ME CASH</i>

00:47.515 --> 00:48.514
TO MAKE MYSELF
AVAILABLE TO YOU.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.815
YOU WERE SPYING ON ME.

00:49.817 --> 00:50.849
MAKE SURE
SHE GETS THIS.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.387
TOBY'S A FRIEND.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.790
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT
WHO YOU ASSOCIATE WITH.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.258
<i> I THOUGHT YOU</i>
<i> WERE ON OUR SIDE.</i>

00:59.260 --> 01:01.593
BEING TRAILED IS GONNA
HELP CLEAR YOUR NAME.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.796
BETTER IT'S ME THAN
SOMEONE WHO THINKS
YOU'RE GUILTY.

01:03.798 --> 01:06.031
SOMEONE'S BEEN SPYING
ON US FOR YEARS.

01:06.033 --> 01:08.400
WHY DID ALISON
HAVE THESE VIDEOS?

01:08.402 --> 01:09.568
THIS IS WHY
SHE WAS KILLED.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.215
IS THAT JENNA?

01:23.217 --> 01:24.583
<i> YOU'RE LATE.</i>

01:24.585 --> 01:26.118
WHO'S SHE TALKING TO?

01:29.924 --> 01:31.824
TOBY.

01:31.826 --> 01:33.826
<i> IT'S NOT RIGHT.</i>

01:33.828 --> 01:36.762
<i> THERE'S NOTHING WRONG</i>
<i> ABOUT US, TOBY.</i>

01:36.764 --> 01:39.598
<i> WE'RE NOT REALLY</i>
<i> RELATED.</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:41.400
<i> ( chuckles )</i>

01:41.402 --> 01:44.570
<i> BE SO EASY FOR ME TO CONVINCE</i>
<i> YOUR DADDY AND MY MOMMY</i>

01:44.572 --> 01:47.673
<i> THAT YOU'VE BEEN</i>
<i> FORCING YOURSELF ON ME.</i>

01:51.545 --> 01:56.648
<i> YOU HAVE NO IDEA</i>
<i> WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.</i>

01:56.650 --> 01:58.183
TURN IT OFF.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.323
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT
THESE VIDEOS ARE?

02:04.325 --> 02:08.193
THEY'RE OF US...
ALLIE, JENNA.

02:08.195 --> 02:10.362
WE'RE YOUNG GIRLS
IN OUR BEDROOMS

02:10.364 --> 02:12.264
CHANGING CLOTHES.
WE'RE NAKED!

02:12.266 --> 02:13.966
EXPOSED.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.834
DO YOU THINK SOMEONE
WAS WATCHING US

02:15.836 --> 02:17.469
AND GETTING IT OFF ON IT?

02:17.471 --> 02:21.440
WELL, WE ALL KNOW WHO HAD
A THING FOR YOUNGER GIRLS.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.978
I FEEL SICK.

02:25.980 --> 02:29.248
IN SOME OF THESE,
WE WERE JUST KIDS.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.650
IAN'S BEEN WATCHING
US FOR YEARS.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.553
AND HE KILLED ALISON
TO MAKE SURE NOBODY FOUND OUT.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.756
I WISH ALI WOULD'VE TOLD US
ABOUT THESE VIDEOS.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.058
YOU GUYS, IT IS NOT
TOO LATE TO HELP HER.

02:40.060 --> 02:43.362
WE CAN USE THIS TO PROVE
THAT IAN KILLED ALISON.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.030
HOW ARE WE GONNA
DO THAT?

02:45.032 --> 02:47.299
WE START BY FINDING OUT
WHAT JENNA KNOWS.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.534
ARE YOU ON SOMETHING?

02:48.536 --> 02:50.435
JENNA'S AT THE TOP
OF OUR A-LIST.

02:50.437 --> 02:53.639
LOOK, I GET IT, OKAY,
BUT SHE KNOWS THAT
THESE VIDEOS EXISTED.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.642
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR THEM.
THAT'S WHY SHE HIRED
CALEB TO FIND THAT KEY!

02:56.644 --> 02:59.578
SPENCE, HOW ARE WE EVER
SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
ANYTHING THAT BITCH SAYS?

02:59.580 --> 03:02.014
IF THAT BITCH IS "A,"
THIS COULD BE A TRAP.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.950
YOU GUYS, IAN WAS
WATCHING ALL OF US.

03:04.952 --> 03:08.587
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
HE STILL IS.

03:08.589 --> 03:11.757
SPENCER'S RIGHT.
WE HAVE TO TRY.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.960
WE'VE BEEN AFRAID OF HER
SINCE THE JENNA THING,

03:14.962 --> 03:17.930
AND NOW WE FINALLY HAVE
SOMETHING THAT SHE WANTS.

03:17.932 --> 03:20.098
ALISON GAVE IT TO US.

03:30.144 --> 03:32.311
The Pierces:<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET,</i>
<i> CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

03:32.313 --> 03:34.913
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE</i>
<i> YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

03:34.915 --> 03:36.748
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

03:36.750 --> 03:39.818
<i> ¶ TAKING THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

03:39.820 --> 03:42.120
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THEN I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

03:42.122 --> 03:45.357
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

03:45.359 --> 03:47.526
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO</i>
<i> CAN KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

03:47.528 --> 03:49.561
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM</i>
<i> IS DEAD ¶</i>

03:52.299 --> 03:54.766
SO, I WILL COVER
THIS BOOSTER MEETING

03:54.768 --> 03:57.202
IF YOU COULD PICK MIKE
UP AFTER PRACTICE.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.504
SURE, UM, AND IF
IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,

03:59.506 --> 04:01.173
HE CAN STAY AT MY PLACE.

04:01.175 --> 04:03.108
LISTEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING OVER HERE.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.711
IT JUST MAKES IT SO MUCH
EASIER TO DO IT IN PERSON.

04:05.713 --> 04:06.979
YEAH.

04:06.981 --> 04:08.647
AND THANKS FOR THE COFFEE.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.549
YOU STILL MAKE
THE BEST CUP IN TOWN.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.619
I'M... HAVING
THE FACULTY MIXER TONIGHT.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.655
UH-HUH.
EVERYBODY WOULD LOVE
TO SEE YOU.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.357
OH... I DON'T KNOW, BYRON.

04:19.793 --> 04:23.228
COME ON.
IT'LL BE FUN.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.197
WELL, IT'S JUST--

04:25.199 --> 04:28.033
WHAT ARE WE SAYING,
"WELCOME TO OUR HOME?"

04:28.035 --> 04:31.036
I MEAN, I DON'T EXACTLY
LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.538
IT'S JUST A PARTY, ELLA.

04:33.540 --> 04:37.576
DAD? HEY, CAN I HELP?
BET WE MAKE A GREAT TEAM.

04:37.578 --> 04:41.113
ABSOLUTELY. I'LL TAKE
YOU UP ON THAT OFFER.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.547
OKAY. BYE.
BYE.

04:42.549 --> 04:45.651
( cell phone ringing )
SO, YOU HEARD US?

04:50.557 --> 04:52.324
THIS IS ABOUT SO MANY
DIFFERENT THINGS.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.759
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.464
THERE'S JUST NO SIMPLE FIX.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.433
LOOK, DAD CARES
TOO MUCH TO SAY THIS,

05:01.435 --> 05:03.435
BUT YOU EITHER LOVE HIM
OR YOU DON'T,

05:03.437 --> 05:05.170
SO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
FIGURE IT OUT,

05:05.172 --> 05:07.272
BECAUSE IT SUCKS
FOR ALL OF US.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.016
COFFEE'S FRESH.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.384
NO, THANKS.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.887
JUST CAME DOWN
TO GET SUPPLIES.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.089
SUPPLIES?

05:24.091 --> 05:28.627
YEAH. I'M SPENDING
THE REST OF MY LIFE IN BED.

05:28.629 --> 05:31.963
OH. YEAH.
I TRIED THAT...

05:31.965 --> 05:34.466
AFTER YOUR FATHER LEFT,

05:34.468 --> 05:37.169
AND YOU CONVINCED ME
I WAS PRETTY AND SMART

05:37.171 --> 05:39.037
AND ISABELLE WAS
FAT AND UGLY?

05:39.039 --> 05:41.506
YEAH, WELL, I LIED
ABOUT THE LAST PART.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.710
WELL, I KNEW THAT,
BUT I GOT OUT OF BED.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.181
I'M SORRY YOU'RE HURTING, HANNA,

05:49.183 --> 05:50.882
BUT YOU'RE GONNA GO
TAKE A SHOWER,

05:50.884 --> 05:52.551
PUT ON A BEAUTIFUL DRESS,

05:52.553 --> 05:55.687
AND KNOW THAT I'M MAKING YOU
GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.521
HERE.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.401
WHAT DID THE LETTER SAY?

06:09.403 --> 06:10.702
WHAT LETTER?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.204
CALEB BROUGHT YOU
A LETTER.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.206
AFTER HE LEFT HERE
YESTERDAY,

06:14.208 --> 06:16.875
HE WAS ON HIS WAY
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.077
WELL, I GUESS
HE DECIDED NOT TO.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.748
HE SEEMED PRETTY DETERMINED
TO FIND YOU.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.083
OH, HE FOUND ME,
LOOKED AT ME,

06:25.085 --> 06:28.120
AND THEN GOT ON THE BUS
TO BASTARDVILLE.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.124
HE WON'T BE ALONE THERE.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.401
MM. HEY, BABE.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.069
YOU, UH, SURE
YOU DON'T WANT ME

06:44.071 --> 06:46.071
TO GIVE YOU A RIDE
TO THE CHURCH?

06:46.073 --> 06:49.875
DON'T BE SILLY. I CAN WALK
FROM THE STATION,<i> DADDY.</i>

06:49.877 --> 06:51.510
( chuckles ) OKAY.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.280
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
BYE.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.186
CHURCH?

07:01.188 --> 07:02.954
WE'RE PLANNING
THE CHRISTENING.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.823
ISN'T THAT
A LITTLE PREMATURE,

07:04.825 --> 07:06.958
YOU KNOW, IF IT'S
NOT BORN A HUMAN.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.260
( door closes )

07:08.262 --> 07:09.327
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.198
WELL, HUMOR'S SUBJECTIVE.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.200
NO, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT IAN,

07:15.202 --> 07:17.235
BUT I HONESTLY THOUGHT
YOU'D BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS BABY.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.442
THAT WAS CRUEL.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.444
I'M SORRY.

07:25.446 --> 07:28.713
WELL... IT DOESN'T HELP
TO TELL ME THAT.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.138
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.407
IS DAD OKAY?

07:58.979 --> 08:00.445
MOM.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.015
YES, HONEY, HE'S FINE.
HE'S FINE.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.622
THEY EXTENDED
YOUR DAD'S ASSIGNMENT,

08:10.624 --> 08:14.493
AND HE WANTS US
TO COME TO TEXAS.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.828
YOU-- YOU MEAN
FOR A VISIT?

08:16.830 --> 08:18.396
FOR A YEAR.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.801
LOOK, HONEY, WE'VE
BEEN SEPARATED TOO LONG.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.369
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR US.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.204
MOM, I-I GET IT, BUT...

08:26.206 --> 08:28.573
( sighs ) YOU KNOW, MAYBE
THIS IS WHAT WE NEED,

08:28.575 --> 08:30.408
YOU KNOW, A FRESH START.

08:30.410 --> 08:33.078
I DON'T NEED
A FRESH START.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.080
I FELT LIKE AN OUTSIDER
FOR SO LONG.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.716
I'M JUST STARTING TO
FEEL LIKE I BELONG HERE.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.185
YOU'RE 16, EMILY.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.420
YOU BELONG WITH YOUR FAMILY.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.095
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU
ALL MORNING. WHERE ARE YOU?

08:50.097 --> 08:51.796
Ezra:<i> I WAS TALKING</i>
<i> TO THE PRINCIPAL.</i>

08:51.798 --> 08:53.031
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.065
<i> ( sighs ) I...</i>

08:56.870 --> 08:59.271
I JUST GAVE
MY RESIGNATION.

08:59.273 --> 09:01.439
EZRA...

09:06.880 --> 09:09.614
HOLLIS OFFERED ME
THE JOB.

09:09.616 --> 09:11.883
UHH!
YOU SCARED
THE HELL OUT OF ME!

09:11.885 --> 09:13.552
THAT HURT.
I DON'T CARE!

09:13.554 --> 09:16.755
THE COPS, THE TEN MESSAGES
YOU SENT ME DOESN'T RING A BELL?

09:16.757 --> 09:18.256
I'M SORRY.
I PANICKED LAST NIGHT

09:18.258 --> 09:20.258
BECAUSE THE GUY WAS
STANDING IN MY DOORWAY

09:20.260 --> 09:22.160
ASKING QUESTIONS
ABOUT A STUDENT.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.328
( period bell rings )

09:23.330 --> 09:25.096
WE'RE FINE.
WASN'T ABOUT YOU.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.799
IT WAS ABOUT SPENCER
AND THE TROPHY AND...

09:27.801 --> 09:29.868
PROPS, AND I...

09:29.870 --> 09:33.471
( chuckles ) ARIA, I'M NOT
GONNA BE YOUR TEACHER ANYMORE.

09:33.473 --> 09:37.075
WE CAN GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE,
GO TO A READING.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.579
WE CAN LIVE OUTSIDE
MY APARTMENT.

09:40.581 --> 09:44.115
( chuckles ) I'M SORRY
I PUNCHED YOU.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.817
MM.

09:45.819 --> 09:49.287
PROFESSOR FITZ!

09:49.289 --> 09:53.425
SO, I'LL BE ATTENDING
THE FACULTY MIXER
AT YOUR HOUSE TONIGHT.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.127
RIGHT, I'LL GIVE
YOU THE TOUR.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.396
( whispers )
I'll show you my room.

09:58.398 --> 10:01.633
AHEM! OKAY THEN.

10:01.635 --> 10:05.170
( sighs ) I KNOW
IT HURTS, HANNA.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.105
HE WAS YOUR FIRST
POOR BOY,

10:07.107 --> 10:09.207
AND THAT'S
OH-SO-ROMANTIC,

10:09.209 --> 10:12.243
BUT ( scoffs )
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.714
CALEB TOLD MY MOM
HE WROTE ME A LETTER.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.016
HE DIDN'T LEAVE ANYTHING
FOR ME, DID HE?

10:20.120 --> 10:23.321
WELL, LET'S
PRETEND HE DID.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.724
IT WOULDN'T
CHANGE ANYTHING.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.359
I MEAN,
HE WAS A JERK!

10:27.361 --> 10:29.527
YOU WANTED HIM
TO GO AWAY, RIGHT?

10:31.965 --> 10:34.766
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'M MORE MAD AT MYSELF
THAN HIM.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.435
FOR WHAT?
FOR BEING STUPID.

10:37.437 --> 10:40.005
I ACTUALLY BELIEVED
HE LOVED ME.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.415
SORRY.

10:55.389 --> 10:58.189
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE MAD
AT ME FOREVER, ARE YOU?

11:00.260 --> 11:02.360
PROBABLY.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.598
WHO'S THERE?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.467
IT'S SPENCER.

11:49.543 --> 11:50.775
WHO ELSE?

11:54.081 --> 11:56.581
ARIA, EMILY...

11:56.583 --> 11:58.383
AND HANNA.

12:00.454 --> 12:01.953
SHOULD I CALL SECURITY?

12:03.590 --> 12:06.291
WE HAVE WHAT YOU HIRED
CALEB TO FIND.

12:06.293 --> 12:09.661
YOU DIDN'T THINK IT WAS WRONG,
BUT TOBY DID.

12:09.663 --> 12:11.996
SO, YOU'VE SEEN IT?

12:11.998 --> 12:13.598
EVERY FRAME.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.938
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

12:19.940 --> 12:22.107
THE TRUTH.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.875
CAN YOU HANDLE THAT?

12:29.916 --> 12:33.218
( sighs ) LOOK, WHEN I SAID
ALISON CAME TO VISIT ME
AT THE HOSPITAL

12:33.220 --> 12:35.453
AT THE HOSPITAL,
I WAS TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.555
SHE DIDN'T COME TO TALK
ABOUT YOU, SPENCER.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.357
THAT WAS A LIE.

12:39.359 --> 12:42.227
AND HOW DO WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE
NOT LYING TO US NOW?

12:42.229 --> 12:44.896
YOU KNEW ALISON, OKAY?
YOU KNEW WHAT SHE
WAS CAPABLE OF.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.332
WE'RE LISTENING.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.701
IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE
SHE WENT MISSING,

12:49.703 --> 12:52.804
AND SHE WAS ON HER WAY
HOME FROM GEORGIA.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.406
SHE HAD JUST FOUND
THE VIDEO...

12:55.408 --> 12:58.076
( sighs ) SHE COULDN'T WAIT
TO PLAY IT FOR ME.

13:00.647 --> 13:04.449
<i> IT'LL BE SO EASY FOR ME</i>
<i> TO CONVINCE YOUR DADDY</i>
<i> AND MY MOMMY</i>

13:04.451 --> 13:06.551
<i> THAT YOU'VE BEEN</i>
<i> FORCING YOURSELF ON ME.</i>

13:10.857 --> 13:13.558
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

13:13.560 --> 13:16.961
THE GUY I LIKE LIKES
TO MAKE MOVIES.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.930
I THOUGHT THEY
WERE JUST OF ME.

13:18.932 --> 13:22.000
YOU THINK
YOU KNOW PEOPLE...

13:22.002 --> 13:25.170
AND THEN
THEY SURPRISE YOU.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.438
TURNS OUT,
THE BOY NEXT DOOR

13:27.440 --> 13:29.841
GETS OFF ON WATCHING
ALL THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.747
AND DARLING JENNA
ISN'T THE VICTIM.

13:35.749 --> 13:37.415
FREAK TOBY IS.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.818
I'M NOT PROUD OF THAT.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.587
I SO DON'T CARE.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.990
I'M GONNA KEEP THIS
UNDER LOCK AND KEY.

13:45.992 --> 13:49.127
AND IF YOU
KEEP OUR SECRET,
IT'LL STAY THERE.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.462
FINE.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.665
I THOUGHT YOU'D
SEE IT MY WAY.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.442
OH, AND JENNA...

14:04.444 --> 14:07.078
IF YOU EVER COME
BACK TO ROSEWOOD,

14:07.080 --> 14:09.280
I'LL BURY YOU.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.593
SHE WAS ON HER WAY
HOME FROM GEORGIA?

14:21.595 --> 14:24.028
TH-THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.964
AND THEN SHE MADE
SOME JOKE

14:25.966 --> 14:27.565
ABOUT HER... TAN.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.301
TOO BAD I COULDN'T SEE IT.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.303
DID SHE TELL YOU
ANYTHING ELSE?

14:32.305 --> 14:35.740
IT WAS
A SHORT VISIT.

14:35.742 --> 14:41.679
LOOK, I-I HAVE GIVEN YOU
WHAT YOU'VE ASKED FOR.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.314
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA GIVE ME?

14:47.020 --> 14:49.487
WE'LL MAKE SURE THE VIDEO
STAYS IN A SAFE PLACE.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.460
Okay.

15:07.340 --> 15:11.175
WE'VE ALL MADE MISTAKES.

15:11.177 --> 15:14.846
REMEMBER, I'M STILL
PAYING FOR YOURS.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.392
( sighs ) SICK.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.560
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
SHE WROTE THAT STORY.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.096
AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW ALI GOT THE VIDEO.

15:32.098 --> 15:35.967
YES, WE DO.
THAT VIDEO WAS ALISON'S
INSURANCE POLICY,

15:35.969 --> 15:38.803
AND SHE CASHED IT IN
THE DAY THAT SHE GOT IT.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.306
WHICH MEANS SHE WAS
WITH IAN WHEN SHE FOUND IT.

15:41.308 --> 15:44.375
AND SHE COULDN'T WAIT
TO PLAY THAT VIDEO
FOR JENNA.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.111
GOD, DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW HAPPY ALI WAS

15:47.113 --> 15:48.913
WHEN SHE CAME BACK
FROM THAT TRIP?

15:48.915 --> 15:51.616
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE,
FOR HER, THE JENNA
THING WAS OVER.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.352
NICE OF HER TO SHARE
THE SAFETY NET WITH US.

15:54.354 --> 15:57.055
"WAIT FOR IT, GIRLS.
WAIT FOR IT."

15:57.057 --> 15:58.623
WAIT FOR WHAT?

15:58.625 --> 16:01.225
THAT'S WHAT ALI SAID
WHEN WE MET HER AT THE TAXI.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.094
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WE
WERE WAITING FOR.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.163
DO YOU REMEMBER
AT ALISON'S FUNERAL,

16:05.165 --> 16:07.665
WHEN WE WERE ALL WONDERING
WHY JENNA WAS THERE?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.634
IF SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH,

16:09.636 --> 16:12.303
JENNA CAME BACK
BECAUSE SHE COULD.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.472
AND ALI'S THE ONE
WHO GOT BURIED.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.847
Aria: WELL, IF YOU WANT,
MY DAD CAN CALL YOUR MOM

16:22.849 --> 16:24.582
AND OFFICIALLY OFFER YOU
THE GUESTROOM.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.084
( sighs ) THIS IS
SO NOT FAIR.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.319
I MEAN, WE LOST
EACH OTHER FOR A YEAR.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.489
I CAN'T IMAGINE
NOT BEING...
I GOT IT.

16:31.491 --> 16:35.193
OKAY, YOU'RE SURE IAN
CAN'T TRACE THIS NUMBER
BACK TO US?

16:35.195 --> 16:37.195
IT'S A PREPAID PHONE,
I USED CASH,

16:37.197 --> 16:39.831
AND THE NUMBER
ISN'T REGISTERED, SO...

16:39.833 --> 16:42.166
SERVICE
IS ANONYMOUS.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.468
HOW DO YOU
KNOW THIS STUFF?

16:43.470 --> 16:47.372
DON'T YOU EVER
WATCH CNN?

16:47.374 --> 16:49.407
NOT ANY CHANCE
OF THAT.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.709
HOMELAND SECURITY
IS TRYING TO BAN
THESE THINGS.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.712
( Ian and his team
chatting )

16:54.714 --> 16:57.215
HE ACTS LIKE HE DOESN'T
HAVE A CARE IN THE WORLD.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.150
HE THINKS HE GOT
AWAY WITH IT.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.351
WELL, HE HASN'T.

17:02.355 --> 17:05.923
OKAY, SO WE CONVINCE IAN
THAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT
ANYTHING BUT MONEY.

17:05.925 --> 17:08.159
HOPEFULLY THAT'LL
THROW HIM OFF OF US.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.828
IF HE WANTS HIS HOME MOVIES,
IT'S JUST GONNA COST HIM.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.164
AND THEN WHEN HE SHOWS UP
FOR THE SWAP, WE...

17:13.166 --> 17:14.432
MAKE OUR OWN MOVIE.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.501
RIGHT, AND WE TAKE THAT,
THE FLASH DRIVE,

17:16.503 --> 17:18.703
AND THE PREPAID PHONE
INTO THE POLICE.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.972
THE SECOND HE RESPONDS
WITH A TEXT, WE KNOW
THAT HE'S GUILTY.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.448
SEND IT ALREADY.

17:39.325 --> 17:40.858
( cell phone chirps )

17:56.109 --> 17:58.910
THERE MUST'VE BEEN
A PART OF ME THAT
DIDN'T BELIEVE IT,

17:58.912 --> 18:02.080
BECAUSE I JUST...
I-I FEEL...

18:02.082 --> 18:03.948
NUMB?

18:03.950 --> 18:06.551
SOMEHOW I-I THOUGHT
I'D FEEL BETTER

18:06.553 --> 18:09.754
WHEN WE FOUND OUT
FOR SURE.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.623
WELL, I KNOW WHAT THEY DO
TO GUYS LIKE HIM IN PRISON,

18:12.625 --> 18:14.992
AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL
A LOT BETTER.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.661
( cell phone beeps )

18:18.965 --> 18:20.698
( sighs )

18:20.700 --> 18:22.834
IT'S JUST MY MOM MAKING SURE
I STAYED OUT OF BED.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.570
( cell phone chirps )

18:29.776 --> 18:31.642
HE WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT WE WANT.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.730
IS THIS THE "LET'S LOVE
ON HANNA" LUNCH COMMITTEE?

18:56.236 --> 18:57.768
FEELING BETTER, SWEETIE?

18:57.770 --> 19:01.139
I'M SORRY, I HAVE THIS THING
THAT I HAVE TO DO.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.807
AND THEN THERE
WERE FOUR.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.309
I'LL HELP.
YEAH, ME TOO.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.844
AND THEN THERE
WERE TWO.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.913
UM, I'M REALLY SORRY,

19:08.915 --> 19:11.549
MONA, BUT SPENCER
HAS THIS THING,

19:11.551 --> 19:13.985
AND SHE REALLY NEEDS
HER FRIENDS RIGHT NOW.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.856
AND THEN THERE
WAS MONA.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.992
( phone ringing )

19:20.994 --> 19:22.026
HANNA!

19:28.101 --> 19:30.935
CALEB. I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.

19:34.807 --> 19:39.043
YEAH, I GAVE HER YOUR LETTER,
AND SHE THREW IT IN THE TRASH.

19:39.045 --> 19:41.546
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, CALEB,
LOSE HER NUMBER,

19:41.548 --> 19:43.648
BECAUSE SHE'S ALREADY
LOST YOURS.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.851
YEAH, BYE-BYE BIRDIE.
SAYONARA, SAM.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.719
HELLO?

19:53.359 --> 19:55.026
WHAT'S THAT LOOK
ABOUT, HERMIE?

19:55.028 --> 19:57.428
HAVING YOUR PERIOD?

19:57.430 --> 20:00.565
HANNA NEVER GOT
THAT LETTER, DID SHE?

20:00.567 --> 20:03.601
SHE THINKS HE LEFT
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.304
YOU KNOW, YOU ACT LIKE
SUCH A TERRIBLE PERSON,

20:06.306 --> 20:09.140
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT
SOME OF IT WAS
JUST AN ACT.

20:09.142 --> 20:10.775
I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

20:10.777 --> 20:13.477
I DIDN'T GIVE HER THE LETTER
BECAUSE CALEB REALLY HURT HER.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.780
YOU THINK WE SHOULD LET HIM
DO THAT TO HER AGAIN?

20:15.782 --> 20:18.216
I SEE NO COMBINATION
OF "YOU" AND "I"
THAT FORMS "WE."

20:18.218 --> 20:20.851
I KNOW I'VE MADE A LOT
OF JOKES AT YOUR EXPENSE,

20:20.853 --> 20:22.620
BUT I WAS JUST
HAVING FUN.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.755
IS THAT YOUR VERSION
OF AN APOLOGY?

20:24.757 --> 20:26.657
I AM SORRY.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.760
AND IF YOU FORGET
ABOUT THE STUPID LETTER,

20:29.762 --> 20:31.596
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

20:31.598 --> 20:35.099
I'LL HELP YOU TRANSFORM
FROM HER-MIE TO HER MAN.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.101
SHE'S NOT INTO ME
LIKE THAT.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.770
NOT YET.
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE, LUCAS.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.639
ARE YOU GONNA
MAN UP OR NOT?

20:45.245 --> 20:48.279
( phone ringing )

20:51.050 --> 20:54.252
THEY FOUND THE VIDEO.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.854
AND THEY'VE SEEN IT.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.224
YOU DON'T NEED
TO WORRY.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.126
I'M TAKING CARE
OF IT,

21:02.128 --> 21:04.228
AND I'LL BE THERE SOON.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.548
HEY. EMILY.

21:26.386 --> 21:29.820
UM, CAN WE-- CAN WE
TALK FOR A SECOND?

21:29.822 --> 21:32.657
ARE YOU WATCHING ME
NOW, TOO?

21:32.659 --> 21:34.725
NO, NOT AT ALL.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.995
IT'S FORCED FAMILY FUN NIGHT
WITH THE REYNOLDS.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.797
<i> DANCING WITH THE STARS</i>
IS ON AND THEY VOTE,

21:39.799 --> 21:42.833
SO THEY'RE ALL REALLY...
INVESTED.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.002
( chuckles )

21:45.004 --> 21:47.038
WHEN I REALIZED
YOU WERE A COP,

21:47.040 --> 21:49.273
I THOUGHT WE HAD
SOMEONE ON OUR SIDE.

21:49.275 --> 21:51.108
WELL, IT MIGHT NOT
LOOK LIKE IT,

21:51.110 --> 21:52.777
BUT I AM ON YOUR SIDE.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.578
I DON'T ENJOY
FOLLOWING SPENCER,

21:54.580 --> 21:56.747
BUT IF SHE HASN'T
DONE ANYTHING WRONG...

21:56.749 --> 21:59.050
IF?
I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT.

21:59.052 --> 22:01.786
OFF THE RECORD,

22:01.788 --> 22:04.255
I KNOW SHE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE
ANYTHING TO HURT ALISON.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.329
HERE'S MY CELL NUMBER.
CALL ME IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.299
THANKS, GARRETT.

22:15.301 --> 22:17.768
I'M GLAD I RAN INTO YOU.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.537
ME TOO.

22:19.539 --> 22:22.039
HEY, UH, IF YOU WANT
TO JOIN IN ON THE FUN,

22:22.041 --> 22:23.607
THERE'S
AN EXTRA LAZ-E-BOY.

22:23.609 --> 22:27.211
THANKS, BUT I SHOULD...
REALLY GET...

22:27.213 --> 22:29.213
THAT'S COOL.
I GET IT. HEH.

22:36.522 --> 22:37.822
HANNA?

22:39.726 --> 22:41.926
I DON'T WANT
TO BE ALONE.

22:45.231 --> 22:48.299
I RAN INTO LUCAS
IN THE PARKING LOT,

22:48.301 --> 22:51.502
AND HE ASKED ME
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

22:51.504 --> 22:54.238
I THINK YOU LEFT IT
IN THE CAFETERIA.

22:54.240 --> 22:57.575
HOW DID THINGS
GET SO SCREWED UP?

22:57.577 --> 22:59.210
( sighs )

22:59.212 --> 23:01.812
NOW YOUR MOM'S BACK THERE
PACKING BOXES.

23:01.814 --> 23:05.149
HMM. MAYBE WE COULD
PACK HER UP.

23:05.151 --> 23:08.085
MM. I THOUGHT THINGS WERE
BETTER BETWEEN YOU GUYS.

23:08.087 --> 23:10.054
THEY ARE.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.089
TEXAS...

23:12.091 --> 23:15.593
IT'S BEAUTY QUEEN
CAPITAL OF AMERICA.

23:15.595 --> 23:18.062
WELL, THAT COULD BE
A GOOD THING...

23:18.064 --> 23:20.097
IF THAT'S YOUR TYPE.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.766
IT'S NOT.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.134
SO, YOU HAVE A TYPE?

23:24.871 --> 23:26.404
OKAY, JUST PROMISE ME

23:26.406 --> 23:28.606
THAT Y'ALL WON'T
COME BACK WITH BIG HAIR.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.541
I PROMISE.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.743
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

23:32.745 --> 23:36.313
I DON'T WANT
TO BE ALONE, EITHER.

24:11.651 --> 24:14.718
I LIKE HAVING
YOU HERE.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.655
BECAUSE IT MAKES A STATEMENT
TO YOUR FAMILY?

24:17.657 --> 24:22.126
NO. BECAUSE I LIKE
HAVING YOU HERE.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.528
I LIKE BEING HERE.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.501
DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT TONIGHT,

24:30.503 --> 24:33.003

25:12.078 --> 25:13.978
ALISON'S SO CUNNING.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.779
SHE'S STILL TAUNTING
US FROM THE GRAVE.

25:17.283 --> 25:20.117
IF THIS VIDEO GETS OUT,
WE WILL LOSE EVERYTHING.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.722
I WON'T LET
THAT HAPPEN.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.090
PROMISE ME?

25:33.766 --> 25:35.966
I PROMISE YOU.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.654
( music playing, chatter )

26:05.698 --> 26:07.264
UH, YEAH.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.732
( doorbell ringing )

26:11.237 --> 26:14.605
HI, I'M JACKIE MOLINA.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.874
IS THIS
THE MONTGOMERY HOUSE?

26:16.876 --> 26:18.776
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

26:18.778 --> 26:20.244
I TEACH AT HOLLIS.

26:22.815 --> 26:25.149
THIS IS THE FACULTY
MIXER, RIGHT?

26:27.753 --> 26:28.752
EXCUSE ME.

26:30.523 --> 26:32.389
UH, YEAH.

26:45.571 --> 26:49.206
<i> ¶ FAR, FAR STILL TO GO ¶</i>
( cell phone beeps )

26:49.208 --> 26:53.544
<i>¶ SHE WAS PRAYING FOR SOMETHING</i>
<i> TO HAPPEN TO HER ¶</i>

26:53.546 --> 26:57.047
<i> ¶ EVERY DAY SHE WRITES</i>
<i> WORDS AND MORE WORDS ¶</i>

26:57.049 --> 27:01.018
<i>¶ JUST TO SPIT OUT THE THOUGHTS</i>
<i> THAT KEEP FLOATING INSIDE ¶</i>

27:01.020 --> 27:03.587
OH, IT'S FROM MELISSA.

27:03.589 --> 27:06.690
IAN NEVER SHOWED UP
AT THE CHURCH. SHE WANTS A RIDE.

27:06.692 --> 27:10.427
I'LL KEEP JENNA BUSY
LIKE YOU ASKED ME TO,

27:10.429 --> 27:12.796
BUT I WISH I WAS GOING
WITH YOU TONIGHT.

27:12.798 --> 27:16.433
HEY, YOU'RE HELPING ME
BY FINDING OUT IF SHE'S
A PART OF THIS OR NOT.

27:16.435 --> 27:19.570
<i> ¶ HOW CAN YOU STAY OUTSIDE ¶</i>

27:19.572 --> 27:22.272
LOOK, I'VE NEVER HAD
A SAFE PLACE TO LAND...

27:24.110 --> 27:26.744
BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE
I DO, SO...

27:26.746 --> 27:29.246
I WANT YOU TO STAY SAFE.

27:29.248 --> 27:32.116
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING
TONIGHT...

27:32.118 --> 27:34.718
I'LL BE THERE
FOR YOU.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.588
I LOVE KNOWING THAT.

27:47.400 --> 27:51.035
<i> ¶ FAR, FAR GOES</i>
<i> THIS LITTLE GIRL ¶</i>

27:51.037 --> 27:56.140

<i> GOOD TO HAPPEN TO HER ¶</i>

27:56.142 --> 27:57.508
( knocking )

28:05.885 --> 28:07.818
WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING?

28:07.820 --> 28:10.421
WHAT, IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO YOU
THAT SHE'D BE HERE TONIGHT?

28:10.423 --> 28:12.122
NO, IT DIDN'T, ARIA.

28:12.124 --> 28:15.259
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
SINCE LAST SUMMER,
AND SHE WAS A T.A. THEN.

28:15.261 --> 28:17.828
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK
THAT YOU STILL HAVE
FEELINGS FOR HER.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.164
THERE'S NO OTHER REASON
FOR YOU TO KEEP THAT
FROM ME.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.466
SHE IS NOT A PART
OF MY LIFE ANYMORE.

28:22.468 --> 28:23.701
YES, SHE IS!

28:23.703 --> 28:26.403
SHE'S DOWNSTAIRS
HAVING WINE WITH MY DAD.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.774
I SCREWED UP.
( chuckles )

28:30.776 --> 28:34.611
NOT TELLING ME ABOUT HER
WAS A LIE.

28:34.613 --> 28:36.380
I'M SORRY.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.718
UNTIL TODAY...

28:40.720 --> 28:42.853
YOU WERE THE ONE GUY
WHO HAD NEVER LIED TO ME.

28:46.025 --> 28:48.826
<i> ¶ THIS IS HOW THE STORY WENT ¶</i>

28:48.828 --> 28:51.395

<i> ¶ WHO BLEW ME AWAY ¶</i>

28:55.434 --> 28:58.001
<i> ¶ WHO BLEW ME AWAY ¶</i>

28:58.003 --> 29:00.938
<i> ¶ IT WAS IN THE DARKEST</i>
<i> OF MY DAYS ¶</i>

29:00.940 --> 29:04.174
<i> ¶ WHEN YOU TOOK MY SORROW</i>
<i> AND YOU TOOK MY PAIN ¶</i>

29:04.176 --> 29:06.910
<i> ¶ AND BURIED THEM AWAY ¶</i>

29:06.912 --> 29:09.847
<i> ¶ AND BURIED THEM AWAY ¶</i>

29:09.849 --> 29:13.450
<i> ¶ I WISH I COULD LAY DOWN</i>
<i> BESIDE YOU ¶</i>

29:13.452 --> 29:16.487
<i> ¶ WHEN THE DAY IS DONE ¶</i>

29:16.489 --> 29:21.892
<i> ¶ AND WAKE UP TO YOUR FACE</i>
<i> AGAINST THE MORNING SUN ¶</i>

29:21.894 --> 29:25.362
<i> ¶ BUT LIKE EVERYTHING</i>
<i> I'VE EVER KNOWN ¶</i>

29:25.364 --> 29:27.898
<i> ¶ YOU DISAPPEAR ONE DAY ¶</i>

29:27.900 --> 29:33.303
<i> ¶ SO I SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE</i>
<i> HIDING MY HEART AWAY ¶</i>

29:35.908 --> 29:38.375
<i> ¶ AWAY ¶</i>

29:45.684 --> 29:48.786
<i> ¶ I WOKE UP FEELING</i>
<i> HEAVY-HEARTED ¶</i>

29:48.788 --> 29:50.788
<i> ¶ GOING BACK</i>
<i> TO WHERE I STARTED ¶</i>

29:50.790 --> 29:53.457
SO, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

29:53.459 --> 29:55.392
BECAUSE HANNA
DESERVES TO BE HAPPY.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.701
Melissa: I TALKED TO HIM
THIS AFTERNOON.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.503
HE WAS TAKING CARE
OF THE CONTRACTOR,

30:06.505 --> 30:08.005
THEN HEADING STRAIGHT
FOR THE CHURCH.

30:08.007 --> 30:10.107
SOMETHING'S WRONG,
I CAN FEEL IT.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.509
CALM DOWN, OKAY?

30:12.511 --> 30:14.978
AH, I CAN'T
FIND MY PHONE.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.780
DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL YOUR NUMBER?

30:16.782 --> 30:20.617
DAMN IT!
I LEFT IT AT THE CHURCH.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.886
MELISSA,
YOU HAVE TO RELAX.

30:22.888 --> 30:25.122
PLEASE, THIS CANNOT BE
GOOD FOR THE BABY.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.891
SPOKEN LIKE A SISTER
WHO ACTUALLY CARES.

30:27.893 --> 30:30.828
I-I CARE, OKAY?

30:30.830 --> 30:33.397
I WISH I COULD BELIEVE YOU.

30:38.003 --> 30:40.504
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO
BACK TO THE CHURCH?

30:40.506 --> 30:42.139
YES.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.841
( crash )

30:46.679 --> 30:48.212
SPENCE, IT'S US AGAIN.

30:48.214 --> 30:51.415
IT'S 7:30 AND WE'RE
AT THE PARK. WHERE ARE YOU?

30:51.417 --> 30:54.518
MAYBE SHE'S ON HER WAY
AND SHE JUST DOESN'T
HAVE A SIGNAL.

30:54.520 --> 30:58.989
I DON'T KNOW. IF SHE'S
NOT HERE IN TEN MINUTES,
WE'RE CALLING THE COPS.

30:58.991 --> 31:01.525
OH, SPENCER.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.862
SHE'S STABLE, BUT THEY'RE
MONITORING THE BABY.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.296
MONITORING FOR WHAT?

31:06.298 --> 31:08.232
THEY SAY IT'S
TOO EARLY TO TELL

31:08.234 --> 31:10.968
HOW SIGNIFICANT
THE TRAUMA WAS.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.502
AND ARE YOU OKAY?

31:12.504 --> 31:15.739
THE CAR CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

31:15.741 --> 31:18.942
OH, HONEY,
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

31:18.944 --> 31:20.811
( crying )

31:28.220 --> 31:29.820
( message tone ringing )

31:33.425 --> 31:35.893
WHAT?

31:35.895 --> 31:38.362
IT'S NOT SPENCER.

31:38.364 --> 31:41.531
IT'S FROM "A."
IT'S FOR ALL OF US.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.901
( reading )

31:46.739 --> 31:48.906
DOES "A" KNOW WE'RE HERE?

31:48.908 --> 31:50.507
"A" KNOWS EVERYTHING.

31:55.748 --> 31:59.683
WE HAVE TO FIND IAN.
I'VE LEFT HIM THREE MESSAGES.

31:59.685 --> 32:02.819
SHE'S NOT GONNA RELAX
UNTIL WE FIND HIM.

32:02.821 --> 32:05.422
MAYBE HE WENT
TO THE CHURCH.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.357
SHE LEFT HER PHONE
THERE, ANYWAY.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.760
IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF BLOCKS.
I'LL GO LOOK.

32:09.762 --> 32:13.764
SPENCER, ABOUT WHAT
I SAID THIS MORNING.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.332
MELISSA KNOWS
THAT YOU LOVE HER.

32:20.739 --> 32:22.105
SPENCER HASTINGS?

32:22.107 --> 32:23.340
YEAH?

32:23.342 --> 32:24.942
WE RECOVERED THIS
FROM YOUR VEHICLE.

32:24.944 --> 32:25.909
THANK YOU.

32:50.069 --> 32:51.768
HE'S HERE.

32:51.770 --> 32:54.137
( phone ringing )
SPENCER, WHERE ARE YOU?

32:56.408 --> 32:58.208
NO! STAY
WITH MELISSA.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.409
WE'RE SAFE.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.378
OKAY. BYE.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.383
THANKS FOR COMING.

33:06.385 --> 33:09.886
TRUST ME,
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.

33:26.005 --> 33:30.073
OKAY. SO, NO ONE ELSE KNOWS
YOU'RE HERE BUT ME, RIGHT?

33:32.211 --> 33:34.544
WELL, I LEFT
A NOTE FOR MY MOM

33:34.546 --> 33:36.480
IN CASE ANYTHING
HAPPENED TO US.

33:36.482 --> 33:39.316
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THIS LOOKS
LIKE THE ONLY WAY IN,

33:39.318 --> 33:42.352
SO IF IAN SHOWS,
I'LL SEE HIM COMING.

34:10.015 --> 34:12.416
HELLO?

34:12.418 --> 34:15.552
HE'S GOT A GUN.

34:15.554 --> 34:16.787
HE DOES?

34:16.789 --> 34:18.255
GUYS, HE'S A COP.

34:18.257 --> 34:21.258
DID YOU REALLY LEAVE
A NOTE FOR YOUR MOM?

34:21.260 --> 34:24.694
YEAH. "DEAR MOMMY,
I WENT TO THE WOODS
TO TRAP A KILLER."

34:24.696 --> 34:26.663
( owl hooting )

34:29.601 --> 34:32.302
HELLO? REVEREND ACKER?

34:48.253 --> 34:50.120
SOMEONE'S COMING.

34:50.122 --> 34:52.689
I WANT THE THREE OF YOU
TO STAY OUT OF SIGHT.

35:08.073 --> 35:10.140
STOP RIGHT THERE.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.675
( clicks )

35:13.445 --> 35:15.645
PUT YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM
AND TURN AROUND.

35:18.817 --> 35:21.318
IT'S NOT IAN.

35:25.958 --> 35:30.327
( phone buzzing )

35:30.329 --> 35:31.761
( slam )

35:42.875 --> 35:45.942
( gasps )
LOSE SOMETHING?

35:45.944 --> 35:48.245
LOOK, SOMEONE PAID ME
TO DROP OFF THIS BAG

35:48.247 --> 35:50.180
AND PICK UP A PACKAGE.

35:50.182 --> 35:52.949
HE FOUND ME ONLINE.
MY NAME IS LOGAN REED.

35:52.951 --> 35:54.684
I'M TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.

35:56.455 --> 35:59.656
SPENCE, UM, IAN DIDN'T SHOW.
HE SENT A MESSENGER.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.791
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO THE HOSPITAL, OKAY?

36:03.328 --> 36:05.495
MELISSA LEFT
HER PHONE HERE.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.030
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO CALL YOU.

36:07.032 --> 36:11.868
YOU KNOW, I GOT
THE STRANGEST
TEXT MESSAGE TODAY.

36:11.870 --> 36:17.674
THE NUMBER WAS BLOCKED,
BUT I COULD REPLY TO IT.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.209
( beep )

36:20.946 --> 36:23.046

36:27.386 --> 36:31.021
( chuckles )

36:31.023 --> 36:33.190
YEAH, ASKING FOR MONEY.

36:33.192 --> 36:35.058
THAT WAS CLEVER.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.528
ARE YOUR FRIENDS
WAITING FOR ME?

36:38.530 --> 36:40.397
LOOK, THERE'S
BEEN AN ACCIDENT.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.098
YEAH, I KNOW.
I GOT THE MESSAGES.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.870
I'VE JUST BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.507
YOU KNOW, MELISSA

36:50.509 --> 36:53.276
WOULD WANT ME
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.581
SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

36:57.583 --> 37:01.117
YOU GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME
LIKE YOU TOOK CARE OF ALISON?

37:01.119 --> 37:03.753
WELL, IS THAT WHY
YOU KILLED HER?

37:03.755 --> 37:05.722
'CAUSE SHE FOUND
YOUR HOME MOVIES?

37:07.459 --> 37:09.326
DO YOU WANT SOME POPCORN
TO GO WITH THAT?

38:17.396 --> 38:18.795
<i> IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.</i>

38:18.797 --> 38:20.163
YOU PUSHED HER,
AND SHE FELL.

38:20.165 --> 38:22.866
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

38:22.868 --> 38:24.534
UHH!

38:24.536 --> 38:27.404
SHE JUST HIT HER HEAD
AND SHE NEVER WOKE UP.

38:27.406 --> 38:30.640
ALISON DIED
OF SUFFOCATION.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.410
YEAH, THE LETTER
THAT I WROTE ON YOUR COMPUTER

38:33.412 --> 38:37.514
WON'T ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS,
BUT IT WILL ANSWER ENOUGH.

38:37.516 --> 38:40.517
THE GUILT WAS JUST
TOO MUCH FOR YOU.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.886
AAH! NO! NO!

38:45.257 --> 38:48.725

LOVE MY SISTER,
YOU WON'T DO THIS.

HEY, LOOK,
YOU DID WHAT YOU
HAD TO DO, OKAY?

40:16.948 --> 40:19.849
NO, I DIDN'T.
SOMEONE ELSE DID.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.918
NO, SPENCE, THERE WAS
NOBODY ELSE HERE.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.720
MAYBE HE FELL.

40:23.722 --> 40:25.622
ALL I SAW WAS
A BLACK HOODIE.

40:25.624 --> 40:26.723
"A"?

40:30.328 --> 40:33.430
IAN KILLED ALISON,
AND HE TRIED TO KILL ME.

Cop: STOP RIGHT THERE.

41:07.332 --> 41:09.165

OF A JOKE?

41:09.167 --> 41:11.568

Byron: ELLA!

42:00.519 --> 42:03.453
I GOT A TEXT FROM ARIA.

42:03.455 --> 42:06.823
I HEARD IAN THOMAS IS DEAD.

42:06.825 --> 42:09.259
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

42:09.261 --> 42:11.361
I'M SO SORRY, BYRON.

42:11.363 --> 42:13.630
NO, IT'S OKAY.

42:13.632 --> 42:16.132
WE'RE OKAY.

42:16.134 --> 42:19.836
<i> ¶ I'M NOT CALLING YOU</i>
<i> A LIAR ¶</i>

42:19.838 --> 42:22.105
<i> ¶ JUST DON'T LIE TO ME ¶</i>

42:24.342 --> 42:25.842
THOSE GIRLS
KNEW ALISON.

42:25.844 --> 42:28.278

WHY WOULD THEY LIE?

42:28.280 --> 42:30.246
<i> ¶ JUST DON'T STEAL</i>
<i> FROM ME ¶</i>

42:30.248 --> 42:33.983

42:39.224 --> 42:41.624
( phones ringing,
beeping )

42:50.368 --> 42:51.901
OH, MY GOD.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.369

42:53.371 --> 42:55.805
"IT'S NOT OVER
UNTIL I SAY IT IS."

42:55.807 --> 42:57.240
"SLEEP TIGHT..."

42:57.242 --> 43:01.578
All: "...WHILE YOU STILL CAN,
BITCHES. -'A'"

43:01.580 --> 43:05.582
<i> ¶ I'M NOT CALLING YOU</i>
<i> A LIAR ¶</i>

43:05.584 --> 43:09.419
<i> ¶ JUST DON'T LIE TO ME ¶</i>

43:09.421 --> 43:13.489
