00:01.200 --> 00:02.775
(Ilana) Okay, so how
many do we have so far?

00:02.876 --> 00:04.277
We're at 59.

00:04.378 --> 00:06.145
(exhales sharply) Okay.

00:06.246 --> 00:07.880
Brrrr... 60.

00:07.982 --> 00:09.415
A GIF basket.

00:09.516 --> 00:12.285
It's an app that stores
.GIFs in your phone

00:12.386 --> 00:13.920
so that when you send a text,

00:14.021 --> 00:15.421
you can send the GIF
faster than your friend.

00:15.522 --> 00:16.923
Love it, going on the list.

00:17.024 --> 00:20.259
Even though, someone at work actually
told me it's pronounced "jiff."

00:20.361 --> 00:21.909
I know, but I am not doing that.

00:21.944 --> 00:24.097
No, it's disgusting. I'm
not doing that either.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.231
Okay, I have one.

00:25.332 --> 00:29.302
A gynecologist that's
also a bikini waxer.

00:29.403 --> 00:32.338
That is a literal one-stop pussy shop.

00:32.439 --> 00:33.606
I love it!

00:33.707 --> 00:35.274
I love you, I love this day.

00:35.376 --> 00:37.777
I think we might actually
be literal geniuses.

00:37.878 --> 00:40.346
Oh, we for sure are geniuses.

00:40.447 --> 00:41.648
Get this.

00:41.749 --> 00:45.184
A skateboard, with a handle.

00:45.285 --> 00:46.919
That's, like, a scooter.

00:47.021 --> 00:48.087
Derr.

00:48.188 --> 00:49.088
Derr, derr, derr, derr.

00:49.189 --> 00:50.423
Okay, I have one.

00:50.524 --> 00:53.168
Boots that have magnets on the
bottom, so when you walk around,

00:53.203 --> 00:55.512
you're just picking up change.
You never need to bend over.

00:55.547 --> 00:56.529
I love that.

00:56.630 --> 00:59.065
Then I could be the
Jewish stereotype that I am

00:59.166 --> 01:01.652
without being known for it.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.610
Exactly, dude.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.673
God, this is the most
productive morning of my life.

01:06.774 --> 01:08.899
- I feel rejuvenated.
- I'm truly alive.

01:08.934 --> 01:10.109
Okay, we're at 63.

01:10.210 --> 01:11.344
I say we get brunch.

01:11.445 --> 01:14.582
If by brunch, you mean bodega
bacon egg and cheese, then I am in.

01:14.682 --> 01:16.249
Dass it.

01:16.350 --> 01:18.117
Damn, the park is serene today.

01:18.218 --> 01:20.353
It's just, like, beautiful.
Why don't we come here more?

01:20.454 --> 01:21.888
- It's just far.
- It is far.

Football's, like, too scary.

Baseball can be hot, but you
need a shortstop or something.

01:38.038 --> 01:38.766
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

For me, it's wrestlers,
gymnasts... jockeys, bay-bay!

01:42.443 --> 01:45.445
I would ride those tiny
jacked little bodies.

01:45.546 --> 01:47.380

01:47.481 --> 01:48.448
You okay?

01:48.549 --> 01:51.684
Like, I don't want to go
today. It's gonna suck so bad.

01:51.785 --> 01:52.719
Listen.

01:52.820 --> 01:54.654
This day comes for all of us.

01:54.755 --> 01:59.058
You must get your license renewed.

01:59.159 --> 02:01.561
At the DMV.

02:01.662 --> 02:02.995
V, V, V...

02:03.097 --> 02:05.182
- It sucks, but you are gonna kill it.
- All right, yeah.

02:05.297 --> 02:08.288
In the span of your whole
lifetime, it's a second.

02:08.836 --> 02:11.137
But in reality, it'll
be, like, 12 hours.

02:11.238 --> 02:13.039
You know what? You're right.

02:13.140 --> 02:15.108
This could be exciting. You know why?

02:15.209 --> 02:18.711
This is gonna be the time that I
take a license photo that is good.

02:18.812 --> 02:20.713
'Course you are. With that ass?

02:20.814 --> 02:22.582
They don't let you put
your ass in the photo.

02:22.683 --> 02:23.816
They really should.

02:23.917 --> 02:26.719
I know you from your ass
better than I know your face.

02:26.820 --> 02:30.469
You know me from my ass better
than you know me from my face?

02:30.504 --> 02:33.493
Yep, and hearing it said back to
me slower only validates it more.

02:33.594 --> 02:34.761
Okay.

02:34.862 --> 02:38.164
Well, we are just two sangle
gals doing our thang today.

02:38.265 --> 02:41.067
I applied for over three
jobs and haven't gotten any.

02:41.168 --> 02:43.503
Today is all about that hustle.

02:43.604 --> 02:44.504
All right, I'll see ya.

02:44.605 --> 02:46.372
I gotta go this way. Ilana!

02:46.473 --> 02:49.549
- Love that lip color.
- Oh, thanks. I found it, it was a rescue.

02:49.910 --> 02:51.110
You found it?

02:51.211 --> 02:53.346
Yeah, there was more than half
left, so I cut the top off.

02:53.447 --> 02:56.516
You don't... buy new. Do you?

02:56.617 --> 02:57.950
No, that's disgusting.

02:58.051 --> 02:59.285
All right.

02:59.386 --> 03:01.053
Later, bitch!

03:03.791 --> 03:06.692
So I need my hair to look
perfect for this photo.

03:06.794 --> 03:09.695
I gotcha, girl. You're gonna look
just like a "Bachelor" contestant.

03:09.797 --> 03:10.934
Oh, uh, no...

03:10.970 --> 03:13.533
No, but one that quits 'cause
she's too good for the show.

03:13.634 --> 03:16.669
Okay, yes, that is perfect.

03:16.770 --> 03:18.938
For real, every single
professional photo

03:19.039 --> 03:22.775
I have ever taken my whole
life has come out horrible.

03:22.876 --> 03:24.644
- Everyone says that.
- No, they are.

03:24.745 --> 03:26.012
I have them all on my phone.

03:26.113 --> 03:28.481
Great, so this is my last license photo.

03:28.582 --> 03:29.849
You see, it's like...

03:29.950 --> 03:32.518
Trying showing that to the cops
every time you get pulled over, huh?

03:32.619 --> 03:34.537
This is my senior photo. That's gross.

03:34.588 --> 03:37.123
It's like, I had braces
for a very long time.

03:37.224 --> 03:39.425
Braces cut up the whole
inside of my mouth.

03:39.526 --> 03:40.693
No one ever tells you that.

03:40.794 --> 03:44.221
This is my homecoming photo,
with my high school boyfriend.

03:44.256 --> 03:45.413
You think he was gay?

03:46.066 --> 03:48.167
Um, I don't like to go
off of looks, but I mean...

03:48.268 --> 03:49.302
- He was gay.
- Yeah, he was gay.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.983
I didn't know. But then
everybody knew, you know?

03:52.018 --> 03:53.971
- Yeah.
- Like, all the teachers knew, too.

03:54.006 --> 03:56.153
- Wow.
- And he's actually a billionaire now.

03:56.377 --> 03:57.610
In Idaho, yeah.

03:57.711 --> 03:59.212
Oh, this is my passport photo.

03:59.313 --> 04:00.346
Is that a bee?

04:00.447 --> 04:01.897
Yeah, that is a bee.

04:01.907 --> 04:04.517
This bee followed me
around Astoria for 30 days.

04:04.618 --> 04:06.101
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

04:09.723 --> 04:11.457

04:11.558 --> 04:13.359
I know. How amazing is that?

04:13.460 --> 04:15.595
I guess, um... Well,
then we'll get started.

04:15.696 --> 04:18.197
So I was thinking some
layers, maybe, um...

04:18.298 --> 04:21.134
And we are done.

04:21.235 --> 04:23.495
- Are we?
- Yeah.

Anyway, I'm not panhandling,
I'm just performing for tips.

04:49.863 --> 04:51.764
Tip if you like, you know, no presh.

05:17.558 --> 05:19.277
I didn't know you take the A train. Hi.

05:19.307 --> 05:21.260
Ilana, I was filming you for my Tumblr.

05:21.361 --> 05:22.795
Oh, my God. Me?

05:22.896 --> 05:24.809

05:24.844 --> 05:27.110
- Here, get a better one?
- No, you idiot... Oh, my God.

05:27.235 --> 05:30.204
Mom doesn't know you got fired and
I'm getting tired of covering for you.

05:30.355 --> 05:31.871
You need to get a real job.

05:31.972 --> 05:35.541
I mean, you were born in the '90s. I'm
sure you've got a Flappy Bird in you.

05:35.642 --> 05:37.940

Yeah, honestly, you not listening
to me about this is homophobic.

05:46.820 --> 05:49.399
- It is?
- No, it's not, but get a job.

05:50.691 --> 05:53.762
I knew you were right
before I did the flip.

05:57.364 --> 05:59.398
Oh that's not so bad.

06:01.034 --> 06:03.002
Oh, God.

06:08.408 --> 06:10.510

06:40.140 --> 06:42.208

times. Just please leave.

06:42.309 --> 06:44.811
I can't, I need a job.

06:44.912 --> 06:46.012

06:46.113 --> 06:47.680
A real job.

06:47.781 --> 06:50.683
No, every time I try to help
you, it turns into a disaster.

06:50.784 --> 06:52.451
- The Chinese food?
- I was hungry.

06:52.553 --> 06:53.986
- The plane tickets?
- I was thirsty.

06:54.087 --> 06:54.987
The door?

06:55.088 --> 06:57.332
I did not know it was
a door. That shape.

06:57.367 --> 06:59.859
You know what? My life is just
a mess right now anyways, okay?

06:59.960 --> 07:01.227
Between you and me, the...

07:01.328 --> 07:02.728
I'm barely hanging on to
this business as it is.

07:02.830 --> 07:04.764
- No.
- See this tooth?

07:04.865 --> 07:05.798
Dead.

07:05.899 --> 07:07.233
(microwave dings)

07:10.638 --> 07:13.272
Is it supposed to take more than
three days to heat up a potato?

07:13.373 --> 07:14.340
I don't think so.

07:14.441 --> 07:16.809
See? Everything in my life is broken.

07:16.910 --> 07:18.611
Plus, I'm two months pregnant.

07:18.712 --> 07:20.279
- Two?!
- Yeah.

07:20.380 --> 07:22.315
I probably shouldn't even
be telling people yet.

07:22.416 --> 07:26.252
Ugh, what is happening to my life?

07:26.353 --> 07:27.620
Will you just come lay with me?

07:27.721 --> 07:28.754
Just...

07:28.856 --> 07:29.822
hold my hand?

it all and start over.

07:38.966 --> 07:41.968
Do you know of any good jobs?

Hi, Abbi Abrams, finally.

08:24.344 --> 08:25.745
Smile on the count of three.

08:25.846 --> 08:28.848
Okay, hold... Just hold... Okay.

08:28.949 --> 08:30.149
Face forward, please.

08:30.250 --> 08:33.519
Can't we just do, like, a
sideways, like, pouty, cool thing?

08:33.620 --> 08:34.921
You have to face forward.

08:35.022 --> 08:36.389
It's regulation.

08:36.490 --> 08:38.323
Or we could just use your old photo.

08:38.424 --> 08:39.991
No, no, no, no.

08:40.094 --> 08:41.674
Okay. Can you just count me down?

08:41.801 --> 08:44.197
'Cause I can only face
forward for, like, a second.

08:44.298 --> 08:45.565
Three...

08:45.666 --> 08:47.066
Two...

08:47.167 --> 08:48.267
One.

08:48.368 --> 08:50.670
(neck crunching) Oh!

08:52.339 --> 08:54.007
Repeat after me.

08:54.108 --> 08:55.875
I am a badass queen.

08:55.976 --> 08:58.211
I am a badass queen.

08:58.312 --> 09:00.213
Kyuh, kyuh, kyuh!

09:00.314 --> 09:01.848
Kyuh, kyuh, kyuh!

09:01.949 --> 09:03.416
That was great.

09:03.517 --> 09:05.018
Thank you. Thank you so much.

09:05.119 --> 09:07.153
- You're very welcome.
- You are so wise.

09:07.254 --> 09:09.522
You have so much insight. You know what?

09:09.623 --> 09:11.691
- I have the perfect job for you.
- Social worker?

09:11.792 --> 09:12.659
Bike messenger.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.993
Even better.

09:14.094 --> 09:16.296
Yass!

09:18.899 --> 09:20.466
Ass, ass, ass, ass.

09:20.568 --> 09:23.136
Ass, ass, ass, ass.

09:23.237 --> 09:24.671
Here you go!

09:24.772 --> 09:26.139
This isn't for me!

09:26.240 --> 09:28.208
Oh, yes it is!

09:28.309 --> 09:29.509
How did she do that?

09:29.610 --> 09:32.378
(cell phone vibrating)

09:32.479 --> 09:33.546
Hey.

09:33.647 --> 09:35.748
Dude, my purpose was
revealed to me today.

09:35.850 --> 09:37.050
From God.

09:37.151 --> 09:38.751
Uh, what, dude? Where are you?

09:38.853 --> 09:40.920
I'm bike messengering. I
have been for, like, an hour.

09:41.021 --> 09:43.823
My ass is v. sore, but that's
what you get when you're BM queen.

09:43.924 --> 09:46.125
I don't know if you should
call yourself a BM queen, right?

09:46.227 --> 09:47.516
I mean it both ways.

09:47.551 --> 09:49.162
Where are you? How's that pic?

09:49.263 --> 09:51.931
It was horrible, so,
I threw my neck out.

09:52.032 --> 09:53.333
Oh...

09:53.434 --> 09:54.634
I threw my neck out

09:54.735 --> 09:57.203
and I think I need to go
to the chiropractor, so.

09:57.304 --> 09:58.204
Oh, my God.

09:58.305 --> 09:59.739
Drop a pin, I'll pick you up.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.841
It would be an honor to deliver
the most precious package

10:01.942 --> 10:03.309
in all of New York City.

10:03.410 --> 10:04.744
Dat ass.

10:06.947 --> 10:08.681
(whimpering) Oh...

10:08.782 --> 10:10.149
(car honking)

10:10.251 --> 10:13.620
♪

10:13.721 --> 10:15.054
Ow!

10:15.155 --> 10:16.256
♪ There she is

10:16.357 --> 10:19.425
♪ The most beautiful
girl in the world ♪

10:19.526 --> 10:20.426
Shit.

10:20.527 --> 10:21.527
Yikes.

10:21.629 --> 10:22.829
That's bad!

10:22.930 --> 10:25.298
We gotta go really slow,
because I really (bleep) my neck.

10:25.399 --> 10:28.067
You won't even know you're on a bike.

10:28.168 --> 10:29.302
Ahh!

10:29.403 --> 10:31.004
I'm definitely on a bike!

10:31.105 --> 10:32.338
Oh, shit!

10:32.439 --> 10:34.607
Oh, my God, slow down, dude!

10:34.708 --> 10:37.343
Thank you so much, Dr. Heller,
you're really saving my life today.

10:37.444 --> 10:40.980
You need to be sure you're
taking care of yourself, Abbi.

10:41.081 --> 10:42.015
(cracking) Ow.

10:42.116 --> 10:43.149
You getting enough sleep?

10:43.250 --> 10:45.051
Well, I mostly tussle,
but I think I'm getting,

10:45.152 --> 10:47.987
like, a solid six hours
of tussling per night.

10:48.088 --> 10:49.188
(cracking) Oh!

10:49.290 --> 10:51.224
And I know your work is very important

10:51.325 --> 10:54.492
and actually, somebody just bought
one of your drawings off my wall.

10:54.527 --> 10:55.461
I saw!

10:55.462 --> 10:57.628
- Last week, about $45.
- Yeah.

10:57.786 --> 11:00.667
That covers your co-pay, so that
means this appointment is for free.

11:00.768 --> 11:02.635
- Yes!
- Yes.

11:02.736 --> 11:04.203
(cracking, farting) Oh!

11:04.305 --> 11:05.872
Oh, good.

11:05.973 --> 11:07.974
Good, that's very healthy.

11:08.075 --> 11:09.175
I'm sorry.

11:09.276 --> 11:12.545
And next time, when you make an
appointment at the DMV, do it online.

11:12.646 --> 11:14.580
That way when you get there,
it just takes a minute.

11:14.682 --> 11:16.004
Wait. Wait, what? Oh!

11:16.158 --> 11:17.884
Lie down, lie down
again, lie down again.

11:17.985 --> 11:19.218
You did it again.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.354
(cracking) Ow.

11:21.455 --> 11:22.956
I'm proud of you.

11:23.057 --> 11:26.009
Wait... What do you mean you can
make an online reservation at the DMV?

11:26.107 --> 11:28.661
Yes, of course you can! This is 2016.

11:28.762 --> 11:30.663
The DMV is actually very nice now.

11:30.764 --> 11:32.565
I don't understand that
you don't know this.

11:32.666 --> 11:35.001
Well, I don't know
the Internet that well.

11:35.102 --> 11:37.603
Look at that, 4:45, you have
one last appointment today.

11:37.705 --> 11:38.938
You can still make it, look.

11:39.039 --> 11:39.939
Holy shit!

11:40.040 --> 11:41.554
Wait a minute.

11:43.144 --> 11:44.344
What are you... (scissors snipping)

11:44.445 --> 11:46.346
Look, look at this.

11:46.447 --> 11:48.014
You're a miracle worker.

11:48.115 --> 11:49.115
Now go get 'em.

11:49.216 --> 11:50.817
Thanks, Dr. Heller. Love you.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.286
I mean, I'll see you
at our next appointment.

11:53.387 --> 11:56.022
Hey, I love you, too.

12:05.432 --> 12:06.733
Hi.

12:08.302 --> 12:10.136
Wow, I love your whole deal.

12:10.237 --> 12:11.204
Mm-hmm.

12:11.305 --> 12:14.374
Anyway, I'm delivering a package for...

12:17.444 --> 12:18.566
Where dis?

12:18.601 --> 12:20.546
It's Hillary Clinton's
campaign headquarters.

12:20.647 --> 12:21.848
<i>(echoing) Headquarters, headquarters...</i>

12:21.949 --> 12:27.253
(choir starts singing majestically)

12:34.094 --> 12:35.028
Mm!

12:40.049 --> 12:40.916
Wow.

12:41.017 --> 12:42.918
- Are you guys hiring?
- Do you have a CV?

12:43.019 --> 12:44.319
A... coconut vice?

12:44.420 --> 12:46.187
A resumé?

12:46.289 --> 12:51.126
Um, it is saved on my photo
stream for cases like this.

12:51.227 --> 12:52.160
Just don't swipe right.

12:52.261 --> 12:53.495
I just accidentally swiped right.

12:53.596 --> 12:54.696
Okay.

12:54.797 --> 12:57.813
- Great. Can you start today?
- Great.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.735
You should probably see
a doctor about that rash.

12:59.836 --> 13:02.637
I know what it is, I'm just tracking
the progress, thank you so much.

13:02.691 --> 13:05.278
Ilana Wexler and Hillary Clinton?

13:05.308 --> 13:08.076
Two powerful whomen whorking as whone?

13:08.177 --> 13:10.045
Well, you'll never see her, but, sure.

13:10.146 --> 13:11.546
- I'm not so sure.
- I'm pretty sure.

13:11.647 --> 13:13.248
Yeah, you're... You're probably right.

13:13.349 --> 13:16.585
Over the next few weeks, we are
gonna push hard toward the primary.

13:16.686 --> 13:19.855
We are gonna call every
registered Democratic voter,

13:19.956 --> 13:22.457
we are gonna confirm the
location of their polling place.

13:22.558 --> 13:23.892
Every vote counts.

13:23.993 --> 13:25.894
Yas, yas, yas, yas, yas!

13:25.995 --> 13:27.195
Thank you.

13:27.296 --> 13:29.931
But just remind them succinctly
that a vote for Hillary

13:30.032 --> 13:31.900
is a vote for the working class.

13:32.001 --> 13:33.268
And minorities.

13:33.369 --> 13:35.704
You know, your caramels,
your queers, your Ls, your Gs,

13:35.805 --> 13:37.376
your Bs, your Ts, your Qs.

13:37.540 --> 13:40.302
Vets, right? Babies.
The... The handi-capable.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.357
Yes! Thank you, Ms. um...?

13:42.490 --> 13:44.746
Ilana... Rodham Wexler.

13:44.847 --> 13:46.248
I love your enthusiasm,

13:46.349 --> 13:49.217
but how about the next time you
have the impulse to say "yas,"

13:49.318 --> 13:51.453
you could just nod.

13:53.422 --> 13:54.956
So back to cold-calling.

13:55.057 --> 13:58.226
It's really important to remind
people of Hillary's service.

13:58.327 --> 14:00.896
Not only was she Secretary of State.

14:00.997 --> 14:02.364
She was a practicing lawyer.

14:02.465 --> 14:06.168
She expanded health insurance
for lower income families.

14:06.269 --> 14:08.236
And she's won a Grammy.

14:08.337 --> 14:09.638
Oh...

14:09.739 --> 14:10.806
(gasping deeply)

14:12.642 --> 14:14.242
I did not know that.

14:14.343 --> 14:18.513
We do not answer questions on: Make-up.

14:18.614 --> 14:19.915
Bras.

14:20.016 --> 14:21.116
Panties.

14:21.217 --> 14:23.318
Um, lastly, some answers

14:23.419 --> 14:25.954
to some common questions
we get on calls.

14:26.055 --> 14:29.291
No, Hillary does not cry at the office.

14:29.392 --> 14:31.593
Yes, Hillary can read a map.

14:31.694 --> 14:34.663
No, Hillary will not
enforce male birth control

14:34.764 --> 14:37.532
or male pregnancy, as
that is not a thing.

14:37.633 --> 14:39.868
And no, Hillary is not a witch.

14:39.969 --> 14:42.003
Do people seriously ask this stuff?

14:42.104 --> 14:43.605
Every day.

14:44.674 --> 14:47.075
Every day!

14:47.176 --> 14:48.777
I guess they do.

14:58.779 --> 15:00.781
_

15:00.816 --> 15:03.558
(harp playing) What is happening?

15:07.196 --> 15:09.164
May I?

15:09.265 --> 15:10.899
Everything you see, you can taste.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.470
Go ahead, try it.

15:15.571 --> 15:16.938
It's delicious.

15:17.039 --> 15:18.073
I'm happy to hear.

15:18.174 --> 15:19.641
Right this way, Miss Abrams.

15:19.742 --> 15:21.643
Dark chocolate, milk
chocolate, white chocolate.

15:21.744 --> 15:24.813
Oh, look, it's a chocolate fountain
and the flowers are edible... (laughing)

15:24.914 --> 15:26.348
Victoria, look, it's Miss Abrams.

15:26.449 --> 15:29.551
We've been waiting for you.

15:29.652 --> 15:30.952
Look, the strawberries match the carpet.

15:31.053 --> 15:33.455
They match the carpet, they're both red!

15:33.556 --> 15:36.804
May I say, what gorgeous hair
you're gracing us with today?

15:36.839 --> 15:38.627
Thank you. My, uh...
My chiropractor did it.

15:38.728 --> 15:41.796
(laughing) Oh, you're hilarious.

15:41.898 --> 15:44.666
I daresay you're the
funniest person I've ever met.

15:44.767 --> 15:46.134
Stop.

15:46.235 --> 15:47.435
This is unbelievable.

15:47.536 --> 15:48.503
Believe it.

15:48.604 --> 15:51.840
This is the DMV the way it can be.

15:51.941 --> 15:53.639
- They are ready for you now.
- Okay.

15:53.797 --> 15:55.810
But, why don't you have a massage first?

15:55.912 --> 15:57.913
They can wait.

15:58.014 --> 15:58.914
Okay.

15:59.015 --> 16:00.148
Thank you.

16:00.249 --> 16:01.249
Hi.

16:01.350 --> 16:03.518
(harp continues playing)

16:05.321 --> 16:06.855
I know, it's like,

16:06.956 --> 16:09.057
(in baby voice) "Pweeze,
Mr. Cwusty Old White Man,

16:09.158 --> 16:11.393
"can I pweeze keep my ovawies?"

16:11.494 --> 16:13.328
All right, bitch, you better
vote... Text me when you do.

16:13.429 --> 16:14.296
Peace. (hangs up)

16:14.397 --> 16:15.835
- Was that a personal call?
- No.

16:15.963 --> 16:17.262
Uh, this woman was bovo'ing out

16:17.299 --> 16:19.534
'cause she didn't know where to
vote and I was like, I got you.

16:19.635 --> 16:20.702
Great.

16:21.871 --> 16:24.506
Hi, I'm calling on behalf
of Hillary Rodham Clinton.

16:24.607 --> 16:26.208
No, she's not a witch.

16:26.309 --> 16:28.276
Um... Do I sound like her?

16:32.381 --> 16:33.248
Ready?

16:33.349 --> 16:37.285
I've never been more ready.

16:37.386 --> 16:39.921
We got it.

16:40.022 --> 16:44.292
Let's do one more, for me.

16:44.393 --> 16:45.527
Wow.

16:45.628 --> 16:46.817
- Yeah.
- Really?

16:46.837 --> 16:48.234
Yeah. Are you a model?

16:49.885 --> 16:52.347
You could be. Take his card. Call me.

16:52.563 --> 16:54.836
Cool. I mean, yeah, sure, maybe I will.

16:54.937 --> 16:55.904
I will.

16:56.005 --> 16:57.105
No, you can call a man a bitch.

16:57.206 --> 16:58.073
Later, bitch.

16:58.174 --> 16:59.307
- Uh, Ilana?
- Yep?

16:59.408 --> 17:02.144
Hi, I found this on my
desk, it has your name on it?

17:02.245 --> 17:03.378
And it says,

17:03.479 --> 17:05.180
"Communications liaison
for Hillary Clinton,

17:05.281 --> 17:07.482
future Presidentress
of the United States."

17:07.583 --> 17:08.849
I just had those made up really,

17:08.951 --> 17:13.054
so, everybody can be familiar
with how to refer to me,

17:13.156 --> 17:14.388
so everybody can reach me.

17:14.490 --> 17:15.857
We know how to reach you, you're...

17:15.958 --> 17:18.894
You're just right here, so.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.228
Fantastic, Barb.

17:20.329 --> 17:21.863
You do not go unnoticed.

17:21.964 --> 17:23.501
- Know that.
- Thank you.

17:23.532 --> 17:25.233
- You're on top of your shit.
- Okay.

17:25.334 --> 17:27.536
Riding me. Yeah.

17:31.207 --> 17:32.107
<i>(man) Hello?</i>

17:32.208 --> 17:33.842
Yes, hello, gentle patriot.

17:33.943 --> 17:37.012
I'm calling on behalf of
Ms. Hillary Rodham Clinton,

17:37.113 --> 17:40.549
first and only mother
of Chelsea and Socks.

17:40.650 --> 17:42.484
Sorry, no thanks, I'm at work.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.720
Eliot, you have to.

17:45.822 --> 17:48.190
It's me! Ilana! Your sister!

17:48.291 --> 17:49.157
Ilana.

17:49.258 --> 17:51.393
Ms. Rodham-Wexler.

17:51.494 --> 17:52.594
Believe it, dude.

17:52.695 --> 17:54.196
I'm calling you from a landline.

17:54.297 --> 17:55.597
I have a real job now.

17:55.698 --> 17:57.132
It's beautiful, actually, when...

17:57.233 --> 17:59.334
When your work and your passion line up.

17:59.435 --> 18:03.104
You know, I'm making money,
but it's not about the money.

18:03.206 --> 18:06.007
You know, just to be clear,
this is not a paid job.

18:06.108 --> 18:08.176
You're a volunteer.

18:12.448 --> 18:13.548
<i>(Eliot) Ilana?</i>

18:13.649 --> 18:14.616
Uh...

18:14.717 --> 18:15.817
Ilana?

18:15.918 --> 18:18.253
Okay...

18:24.961 --> 18:25.927
Oh!

18:26.028 --> 18:28.380
Ooof... I got sunscreen in my (bleep)!

18:35.369 --> 18:36.302
Yeah.

18:36.403 --> 18:37.470
Check it out.

18:37.571 --> 18:39.105
This is cool, this is cool to see this.

18:39.206 --> 18:42.842
Your best friend has
been working hard all day

18:42.943 --> 18:46.179
on the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign!

18:46.280 --> 18:47.374
She's worked in here.

18:47.409 --> 18:49.865
She's walked on these floors.
She's... breathed this air.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.185
Take it in. (both inhaling deeply)

18:52.286 --> 18:54.020
Yeah, that is power.

18:54.121 --> 18:55.054
It smells decisive.

18:55.155 --> 18:56.622
It smells like confidence.

18:56.724 --> 18:58.491
It smells like no bullshit.

18:58.592 --> 19:00.209
- Yeah.
- That's my former desk.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.894
- Wow.
- This is my former chair.

19:01.995 --> 19:04.130
- Cool.
- Good sitting and calling.

19:04.231 --> 19:06.632
This is the former leaning column.

19:06.734 --> 19:10.429
Sorta talk about big stuff that's
going on, domestic, international.

19:10.476 --> 19:12.171
- Very cool.
- Very casual.

19:12.272 --> 19:15.541
(voices distorting) ♪

19:21.248 --> 19:23.116
♪

19:26.920 --> 19:28.755
Yas! Yas!

19:28.856 --> 19:31.424
Holy...

19:31.525 --> 19:35.962
(both laughing) Oh...

19:36.063 --> 19:37.263
Oh, yay!

19:37.364 --> 19:39.499
Sorry, we are just so excited.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.167
That's all right, just take your time.

19:41.268 --> 19:42.635
One more.

19:42.736 --> 19:47.707
(both squealing)

19:47.808 --> 19:50.510
Thank... Thank you, Ilana,
thank you for all of your help.

19:50.611 --> 19:51.577
You know of me?

19:51.678 --> 19:53.412
Well, you're wearing a nametag.

19:53.514 --> 19:54.781
- Genius.
- Yes.

19:57.217 --> 19:58.117
Abbi.

19:58.218 --> 19:59.619
Hello.

19:59.720 --> 20:00.820
Proud demo.

20:00.921 --> 20:01.821
Crat.

20:01.922 --> 20:02.889
College!

20:02.990 --> 20:04.791
Aquarius.

20:04.892 --> 20:05.825
I pegged...

20:05.926 --> 20:07.460
Secretary Clinton.

20:07.561 --> 20:09.695
<i>Madam... Présidente.</i>

20:09.797 --> 20:10.830
She-king.

20:10.931 --> 20:13.366
I can't afford to
volunteer here full-time,

20:13.467 --> 20:14.967
but I still want to get the word out,

20:15.068 --> 20:17.503
so I vow to tweet once a week,

20:17.604 --> 20:20.506
"Vote for Hillary. Yas, yas, yas."

20:20.607 --> 20:22.175
That would be great.

20:22.276 --> 20:25.211
We need to drum up some
excitement for the campaign,

20:25.312 --> 20:27.046
do everything that we possibly can.

20:27.147 --> 20:28.881
You know what I'll do?

20:31.318 --> 20:32.518
Yes.

20:36.290 --> 20:38.524
Look at that!

20:38.625 --> 20:42.128
I thought this would be
really good for office morale!

20:42.229 --> 20:43.529
Isn't she great?

20:43.630 --> 20:45.531
Of course.

20:45.632 --> 20:47.366
We assumed it was a he.

20:47.467 --> 20:49.633
Oh, no, no. It's a she.

20:49.668 --> 20:50.987
(Abbi) It's definitely a she.

20:51.047 --> 20:53.513
Oh, God. Yeah.

20:53.563 --> 20:55.949
- This feels... just right.
- Right.
