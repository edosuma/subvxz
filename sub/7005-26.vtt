00:03.669 --> 00:05.937
Good show, al.
Thank you.

00:05.938 --> 00:09.107
Tim, do you want
the big ice pack
or the small ice pack today?

00:10.776 --> 00:13.645
I'll take the small one.
It's just my head.

00:15.481 --> 00:18.182
So, guys, enjoy
your next two weeks off.

00:18.183 --> 00:20.184
You doing something special?

00:20.185 --> 00:24.255
Only taking my dream vacation -
island-hopping in the caribbean.

00:24.256 --> 00:27.792
How about you?
<i>(imitating heidi)</i> "only
taking my dream vacation..."

00:27.793 --> 00:31.096
Me and the hot rod
in the garage.

00:31.097 --> 00:33.298
How about you, al?
Got anything planned?

00:33.299 --> 00:36.168
Aw, just going up to my cabin,

00:36.169 --> 00:38.170
All by myself,
thinking about

00:38.171 --> 00:42.040
How the best years of
my life have slipped away.

00:42.041 --> 00:45.477
Well, have fun.

00:45.478 --> 00:48.079
<i>(sighs)</i>

00:54.486 --> 00:56.922
You hate seeing me like this,
don't you?

00:56.923 --> 01:00.859
Yes, I do.
That's why I'm leaving.

01:00.860 --> 01:03.527
All right, all right.
I know you're not gonna
be able to rest

01:03.528 --> 01:06.030
Till you know
what's bothering me.

01:06.031 --> 01:09.100
I'm depressed because I have
that big birthday coming up.

01:09.101 --> 01:12.070
You know, the big three-seven.

01:14.006 --> 01:16.007
"the big three-seven"?

01:16.008 --> 01:19.811
Generally, the big birthdays
would be the big three-o,
the big four-o.

01:19.812 --> 01:22.647
I've just always marched to
the beat of a different drummer.

01:22.648 --> 01:27.952
Maybe it's time you marched
to the couch of a psychiatrist.

01:27.953 --> 01:32.257
It's just I thought
when I reached this age,
I'd be successful!

01:32.258 --> 01:35.426
You are successful.
No, I'm not.

01:35.427 --> 01:39.965
I'm a 37-year-old bachelor
who's a career second banana.

01:39.966 --> 01:44.169
I don't have any creativity.
I have very little pizzazz.

01:44.170 --> 01:48.974
You have absolutely no pizzazz.
But you can be creative.

01:48.975 --> 01:51.443
Name one creative thing
I ever did on <i>tool time.</i>

01:51.444 --> 01:55.180
Um... W-- gadget corner.
That was your idea.

01:55.181 --> 01:58.716
No. I just took credit for it.
Wait a minute.

01:58.717 --> 02:02.253
What about that tool time game
you designed?

02:02.254 --> 02:05.890
That was mine.
You liked that?
No. I thought it was stupid.

02:05.891 --> 02:08.592
But everybody else liked it.
Yeah!

02:08.594 --> 02:11.096
Everybody else loved
my tool time board game.

02:11.097 --> 02:13.031
You feeling better now?
Yes, I am.

02:13.032 --> 02:16.534
All right.
Because even if you aren't,
I'm still leaving.

03:06.351 --> 03:08.253
Thanks.
Hold the exhaust pipe up.

03:08.254 --> 03:11.089
Ok.
Look out! It's hot!

03:11.090 --> 03:13.391
All right. You got it? Ok.

03:13.392 --> 03:15.393
How does it feel to work
on your first hot rod?

03:15.394 --> 03:17.395
Dad, I worked on the last one.

03:17.396 --> 03:20.431
You did? What did you do?

03:20.432 --> 03:23.234
Tightened the radiator hose.

03:23.235 --> 03:27.239
I remember the radiator hose,
but I don't remember you.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.774
Thanks a lot, dad.
Don't take it personally.

03:29.775 --> 03:33.511
When a man works on a hot rod,
he tunes out everything that
doesn't have a motor in it.

03:33.512 --> 03:36.213
Oh, yeah.

03:36.214 --> 03:38.415
All right. I got it.
I want you to do me a big favor.

03:38.416 --> 03:40.217
Go out in the mustang
and get in the back seat.

03:40.218 --> 03:42.653
There's a big box of wires,
all right?
Ok.

03:44.156 --> 03:48.826
Tim, did you tell al
that he was creative?

03:48.827 --> 03:50.828
Yeah. I had to.
Otherwise I'd still be
at <i>tool time</i>

03:50.829 --> 03:53.565
Listening to him whining.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.901
"I'm such a loser.
I have no life left.

03:56.902 --> 04:01.940
Even my beard doesn't fit
my face anymore."

04:01.941 --> 04:04.976
Well, according to ilene,
whatever you said

04:04.977 --> 04:08.279
Made al decide to market
his tool time game.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.049
He's invested
his entire life savings.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.550
He did? That's crazy.

04:12.551 --> 04:15.086
He ordered 500 games
and he made a commercial.

04:15.087 --> 04:17.922
You gotta go over there
right away
and talk some sense into him.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.390
I can't. I'm hanging
the exhaust system right now.

04:19.391 --> 04:22.460
Look, tim, al could be on
the brink of financial disaster.

04:22.461 --> 04:24.763
You gotta do something.
I'll give him a call
or something.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.965
No! Calling is not good enough.
Go over there.

04:27.966 --> 04:29.701
All right.
I'll go over there.

04:29.702 --> 04:32.937
When I get back,
he'll be just as depressed
and boring as usual.

04:38.277 --> 04:43.280
Well, I guess
you're wondering why I'm having
all these extra lines put in.

04:43.281 --> 04:45.083
Nope.

04:47.686 --> 04:52.123
You ever watch <i>tool time?</i>
Nope.

04:52.124 --> 04:55.627
You like board games?
Nope.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.962
Hey, al.
Hey, tim.

04:57.963 --> 05:01.165
Hey, I know you!
You like <i>tool time,</i> huh?

05:01.166 --> 05:03.468
Nope.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.437
My wife's head nurse
on the emergency ward.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.610
It's marge.
You must be bob.
Yeah.

05:12.611 --> 05:14.412
I've heard a lot about you.

05:14.413 --> 05:16.815
Say, did you ever get over
that little gambling problem?

05:16.816 --> 05:19.717
Oh, you bet!

05:19.718 --> 05:23.321
Anyway... Well, you're all set.
All three lines are working.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.823
Ok. When you see marge,
tell her I'll see her soon.

05:25.824 --> 05:28.193
Hey, I'd put money on it!

05:30.029 --> 05:32.764
Um, al, what's going on?

05:32.765 --> 05:36.701
Uh, jill told me that you
put all your life savings
into this board game?

05:36.702 --> 05:40.971
Yes, I did! I told you about
that when I came over.

05:40.972 --> 05:43.041
You came over?

05:43.042 --> 05:45.743
Yeah. You were putting
in the drive shaft

05:45.744 --> 05:49.580
I remember the drive shaft,
but I don't remember you.

05:49.581 --> 05:52.250
I even have my brother cal
coming in to help me
fill orders.

05:52.251 --> 05:54.552
This is gonna be big!
I can feel it!

05:54.553 --> 05:59.391
For the first time in my life,
I have confidence
in my financial future.

05:59.392 --> 06:02.226
So confident...

06:02.227 --> 06:04.496
I'm gonna propose to ilene.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.731
Propose?
Saturday night.

06:06.732 --> 06:10.402
Wow! That's a big step.
Yes, it is
and I'm ready to take it.

06:10.403 --> 06:13.371
Now, don't tell her.
I want this to be
a big surprise.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.673
Al, aren't you getting
a little ahead of yourself?
You haven't sold one game yet.

06:15.674 --> 06:19.010
Ah, that's what they said
to milton bradley.

06:19.011 --> 06:21.613
That's what they said
to the parker brothers.

06:21.614 --> 06:24.181
And don't forget
the parcheesi sisters.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.652
Tim, this is a great game.

06:27.653 --> 06:30.822
And I want you
to have the first one.

06:30.823 --> 06:33.090
Thank you, al.
Boy, it's heavy!

06:33.091 --> 06:35.994
Yeah.
Tool man looks pretty good
on the box, too, huh?

06:35.995 --> 06:39.063
Look, look!
My commercial's on!

06:39.064 --> 06:41.933
<i>Look for me and my friends</i>
<i>on the cover of the box.</i>

06:41.934 --> 06:45.703
So, act now because these games
will go like hot cakes.

06:45.704 --> 06:48.506
We'll ship your order out
within three business days

06:48.507 --> 06:50.475
Or double your money back.

06:50.476 --> 06:54.511
You have al borland's
personal guarantee.

06:54.512 --> 06:57.815
So, now you can do more
than just watch us on tv.

06:57.816 --> 06:59.883
You can play with us at home!

06:59.884 --> 07:02.019
Call now.
Operators are standing by.

07:02.020 --> 07:04.021
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

07:07.326 --> 07:09.727
So? What did you think
of my commercial?

07:09.728 --> 07:12.897
It looks like
it cost six cents.
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

07:12.898 --> 07:15.667
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm.

07:17.670 --> 07:21.505
This is the operator.
I'm standing by.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.309
Uh, could you please hold?

07:25.310 --> 07:29.914
Oh, this is great!
Oh, I owe it all to you,
my best friend.

07:29.915 --> 07:32.684
You made me believe in me!

07:32.685 --> 07:34.585
Oh, no, no, no. No hugs.

07:36.489 --> 07:39.757
Al keeps saying
that he can't marry me
until he's financially secure.

07:39.758 --> 07:42.926
And then he invests every penny
he has in that stupid game.

07:42.927 --> 07:44.729
What does that say to you?

07:44.730 --> 07:48.198
It says I'm gonna have
the cleanest pots and pans
on the block.

07:50.068 --> 07:52.903
Ilene, it's not uncommon
for people

07:52.904 --> 07:55.640
To set up barriers
to avoid commitment.

07:55.641 --> 07:59.143
But what am I supposed to do?
Wait around forever?

07:59.144 --> 08:03.348
I'm about to turn
the big three-four.

08:06.818 --> 08:10.255
Look, as much as you love al,
as much as I care about him,

08:10.256 --> 08:13.991
I have to say you have to
think about what your needs are.

08:13.992 --> 08:16.961
And if al can't fulfill them,

08:16.962 --> 08:21.031
Then maybe it's time
for you to move on.

08:21.032 --> 08:25.736
I don't know.
I really thought
we were on the right track.

08:25.737 --> 08:28.406
Do you have any more steel wool?

08:28.407 --> 08:31.942
Uh, yeah.
It's in the garage.
I'll get it.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.880
I'll tell you this, jill.

08:35.881 --> 08:40.384
If I hear another word
about that stupid game,
I will go crazy.

08:40.385 --> 08:43.253
Hey, ilene.
Look what al gave me.

08:43.254 --> 08:46.157
I can't take it anymore!

08:47.693 --> 08:49.793
She's just upset
because she thinks

08:49.794 --> 08:52.530
She's gonna have to wait forever
for al to propose.

08:52.531 --> 08:55.133
She may only have to wait
till Saturday.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.702
Get out of town!

08:57.703 --> 09:00.038
What made him
suddenly decide to ask her?

09:00.039 --> 09:01.839
Well, actually, the game looks
like it might take off.

09:01.840 --> 09:05.643
He thinks he's gonna be
the new milton monopoly.

09:05.644 --> 09:09.180
She's gonna be so happy.
Let al tell her, all right?

09:09.181 --> 09:11.849
I would never tell her.

09:11.850 --> 09:14.586
I need a little help
on the hot rod.
Mark's home.

09:14.587 --> 09:18.590
Oh, good. Going over to al's
put me off schedule
by about an hour.

09:18.591 --> 09:20.892
Well...
Mark!

09:22.561 --> 09:24.862
Jill, maybe you're right.

09:24.863 --> 09:27.899
Maybe it is time for me
to break it off with al.

09:27.900 --> 09:31.802
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

09:31.803 --> 09:35.572
Completely the wrong time.

09:35.573 --> 09:37.942
But you just said--
forget what I said.
I say a lot of things.

09:37.943 --> 09:41.546
I don't mean any of 'em.
So you don't mean what
you're saying right now.

09:41.547 --> 09:44.315
No. This is the only thing
I've ever meant.

09:45.750 --> 09:48.920
Did tim tell you something?
No.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.655
I know nothing. Nothing!

09:53.192 --> 09:57.862
And even if I did know
something,

09:57.863 --> 10:00.865
I wouldn't be allowed
to tell you.

10:03.501 --> 10:07.304
But I could guess?
And you could nod?

10:09.608 --> 10:12.643
Is what you don't know
a good thing?

10:12.644 --> 10:16.080
Is this a very,
very good thing?

10:16.081 --> 10:19.250
Is this a call-your-parents-
pick-out-a-china-pattern
sort of thing?

10:19.251 --> 10:21.785
Oh, my god! No way!

10:23.589 --> 10:26.524
I am so happy!
I know. I know.

10:32.664 --> 10:37.502
Talk about a mood swing.
Yes. Huge mood swinger.

10:48.346 --> 10:50.347
You told her, didn't you?

10:50.348 --> 10:52.784
I didn't say a word.

10:52.785 --> 10:56.120
You did that head-nodding thing,
didn't you?

10:58.857 --> 11:01.926
You are so childish.

11:01.927 --> 11:05.063
Dad, it's the tool time game.
Let's play.
Can't. I'm on a schedule.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.131
I'll let you be tim.

11:12.104 --> 11:14.772
I want to play, too.
Here, mark. You go first.

11:14.773 --> 11:17.275
All right.
Oh, look at these figures.

11:17.276 --> 11:22.746
This is so cool.
They even have little
removable tool belts.

11:22.747 --> 11:25.983
Ok. Two.

11:25.984 --> 11:29.086
Let's see.
"tim installs plumbing...

11:29.087 --> 11:31.923
That actually works!"

11:31.924 --> 11:34.792
All right!
Ok. Three.

11:34.793 --> 11:37.862
One, two, three -
get a card.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.831
"tim repairs outdoor lighting
in a rainstorm

11:40.832 --> 11:43.367
And you are electrocuted.

11:44.869 --> 11:47.605
Wait for the ambulance."

11:47.606 --> 11:48.873
Watch this.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.641
<i>(siren)</i>

11:50.642 --> 11:54.411
This is so great!
Al is gonna make a fortune
on this.

12:13.498 --> 12:15.866
You know, he is gonna sell
a lot of these.

12:17.368 --> 12:21.172
You play it once,
and you gotta buy another one.

12:21.173 --> 12:24.008
What happened?
It caught on fire.

12:24.009 --> 12:26.677
<i>(both)</i> we know that.

12:26.678 --> 12:29.580
Well, the problem
is the wiring.

12:29.581 --> 12:31.582
Looks like they used
26-gauge wiring.

12:31.583 --> 12:35.386
This is definitely
an 18-gauge-wire setup.
Well, what does that mean?

12:35.387 --> 12:40.191
It means al's got
500 board games that
you can barbecue ribs on.

12:40.192 --> 12:42.192
Tim, you gotta call him.

12:42.193 --> 12:44.261
Yeah. He's gotta know
about this.

12:44.262 --> 12:46.730
He's not gonna like it,
I'll tell you that.

12:49.601 --> 12:51.602
<i>(♪ "tool time" theme)</i>

12:53.638 --> 12:56.306

13:20.132 --> 13:23.668
Cal, would you get out here?
The tool time game. Please hold.

13:23.669 --> 13:26.037
<i>(toilet flushes)</i>

13:26.038 --> 13:28.039
<i>(phones ringing)</i>

13:28.040 --> 13:30.307
<i>(knocking)</i>

13:30.308 --> 13:33.244
Hi, guys.
<i>(both)</i> hey, tim.

13:34.679 --> 13:36.313
I came to talk about the game.

13:36.314 --> 13:38.149
Have you opened one of those up
and played it yet?

13:38.150 --> 13:40.117
No. We're waiting to treat
ourselves to a game

13:40.118 --> 13:42.219
After we finish filling orders.

13:42.220 --> 13:44.421
Can I help you?
Hey, tim.

13:44.422 --> 13:47.457
I wanna thank you for
encouraging my little brother
to follow his dream.

13:47.458 --> 13:51.161
That's great, cal.
I just can't stop
thanking you!

13:51.162 --> 13:53.163
Cal, could you please try?

13:53.164 --> 13:55.199
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

13:56.734 --> 13:58.101
Thank you very much.

13:58.102 --> 14:00.271
Al, can I talk to you
about the game for a minute?

14:00.272 --> 14:03.641
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Oh, boy, this is great!

14:03.642 --> 14:06.777
I'm telling you, the phones
are ringing off the hook!

14:06.778 --> 14:10.247
I never thought this game
would catch fire so soon.

14:13.017 --> 14:16.621
Well, it did.
What do you need
to talk to me about?

14:16.622 --> 14:19.690
I think they might have put
the wrong wire in it.
It's defective.

14:19.691 --> 14:22.927
We played it last night
and it caught fire.
Caught fire?

14:22.928 --> 14:26.464
Everything you do catches fire.
What did you do to it?

14:26.465 --> 14:29.666
I didn't do anything to it.
I opened it up
and the wiring's wrong.

14:29.667 --> 14:32.436
It should be 18-gauge wiring.
It's 26-gauge wiring.

14:32.437 --> 14:36.874
Oh, no, no. Lars guaranteed me
they used only the best quality.

14:36.875 --> 14:39.977
Maybe it was just the wiring
in your game.

14:39.978 --> 14:43.881
Aha! 26 gauge.

14:43.882 --> 14:45.783
Maybe it's just
these two games.

14:45.784 --> 14:47.417
Maybe...

14:47.418 --> 14:50.688
And maybe this summer
you'll finally look good
in a thong.

14:55.460 --> 14:57.161
Oh, no.

14:57.162 --> 15:01.298
Oh, my god!
This is... This is a disaster!

15:01.299 --> 15:03.333
People could get hurt!

15:03.334 --> 15:06.470
I could lose
my entire life savings!

15:06.471 --> 15:08.005
Well, actually
that would be, um...

15:08.006 --> 15:10.874
Double my life savings!

15:13.445 --> 15:15.145
Would you relax, please?
Just relax.

15:15.146 --> 15:17.214
You're right. You're right.
What do I have to be nervous
about?

15:17.215 --> 15:21.085
You know, lars made these games,
it's his responsibility
to fix them.

15:21.086 --> 15:24.621
Right. It's probably
in the contract you signed.
Contract?

15:26.425 --> 15:28.292
<i>(speaking chinese)</i>

15:32.064 --> 15:34.531
Well, same to you, bub.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.502
This is lars?
I'm not lars.

15:38.503 --> 15:41.339
I'm dave of
"dave's fortune cookies."

15:41.340 --> 15:43.673
Where's lars of "lars' games"?

15:43.674 --> 15:48.512
He had some bad fortune.
The cops came and arrested him.

15:48.513 --> 15:51.282
So, lars is behind bars.

15:53.852 --> 15:55.286
Oh, boy!

15:55.287 --> 15:59.289
There were 140 complaints with
the better business bureau.

15:59.290 --> 16:03.126
And most of them were
bad wiring.

16:03.127 --> 16:06.030
Boy! Were there
some real suckers, huh?

16:09.067 --> 16:13.070
I think I've been taken!
You think?

16:13.071 --> 16:15.905
Where are you going?
I'm going up to my cabin

16:15.906 --> 16:18.476
One last time
before I have to sell it.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.844
So, you're just gonna
run away?
What's the point?

16:20.845 --> 16:22.880
I'm bankrupt.
I have no future,

16:22.881 --> 16:25.082
And I have no right
to ask ilene to marry me.

16:25.083 --> 16:29.119
What am I supposed to do?
Here. Have a fortune cookie.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.389
They always cheer people up.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.828
"you've gone as far
as you can go in life."

16:39.998 --> 16:42.266
<i>(both)</i> try another one.

16:46.838 --> 16:49.840
"your best days are behind you."

16:56.481 --> 16:58.749
All right. Ok.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.418
Bingo. Done. Got it.

17:01.419 --> 17:05.155
Got it. Ok.

17:05.156 --> 17:07.324
Dad, what are you doing?

17:07.325 --> 17:10.093
Fixing al's motor.

17:10.094 --> 17:12.997
Took me 12 minutes.
Why are you timing yourself?

17:12.998 --> 17:16.967
Well, I'm trying to figure out
how I can redo all his motors
in two days.

17:16.968 --> 17:20.771
I've got six people
working on 500 motors.
12 minutes a piece.

17:20.771 --> 17:23.374
That means they can all
be fixed in, um...

17:23.375 --> 17:27.042
A lot less time than it'll
take you to figure out
the answer?

17:30.515 --> 17:32.416
All right. Perfect.
Right there.
Is that it?

17:32.417 --> 17:34.652
You got it. Great, ilene.
We gotta hurry up.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.755
Al should be back
tomorrow sometime.
We got plenty of games...

17:37.756 --> 17:40.257
Cal, why don't
you play with your own motor?

17:40.258 --> 17:43.427
Sorry.

17:43.428 --> 17:46.330
Great job, heidi.
Thank you.

17:46.331 --> 17:49.099
Jill, you're no heidi.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.268
Well, duh.

17:52.770 --> 17:55.038
I mean, you're six motors
behind the rest of us.

17:55.039 --> 17:57.774
Oh, come on! We've been
at this for 11 hours.

17:57.775 --> 17:59.309
I need a break.

17:59.310 --> 18:01.778
What you need is
some hot coffee.

18:01.779 --> 18:04.114
Look how fast wilson's working.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.518
You know, I never was much
of a coffee drinker in the past.

18:08.519 --> 18:10.153
It's the first time
I've had one full cup,

18:10.154 --> 18:12.890
Let alone eight cups,
and it's really quite
invigorating.

18:12.891 --> 18:15.593
Reminds me of the buddhist monks
after hours of meditation.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.595
No more coffee for wilson.

18:18.596 --> 18:20.831
I need chocolate
and I need it now!

18:23.367 --> 18:25.335
Al's gonna be so touched
when he comes home

18:25.336 --> 18:27.638
And sees his friends
have fixed all his games.

18:27.639 --> 18:29.706
Euripides said that
true friendship is shown
in times of trouble;

18:29.707 --> 18:31.775
Prosperity is full of friends.

18:33.678 --> 18:37.014
Al! What are you doing here?

18:37.015 --> 18:41.685
I live here.
What are you guys doing here?

18:41.686 --> 18:45.322
We work here.

18:45.323 --> 18:47.024
Tim figured out a way
of fixin' your game

18:47.025 --> 18:49.026
And asked us all
to pitch in and help.

18:49.027 --> 18:51.695
It was just that one wire
we replaced.

18:51.696 --> 18:54.064
I can't believe
you did this for me!

18:54.065 --> 18:55.566
Aw, jeez!

18:57.936 --> 19:03.040
Tim, underneath that gruff,
insensitive exterior,

19:03.041 --> 19:05.108
You're a kind
and beautiful man.

19:05.109 --> 19:08.312
<i>(grunts)</i> right.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.480
I think what tim
is trying to say is

19:10.481 --> 19:12.282
You have always done
so much for us,

19:12.283 --> 19:14.384
And this was our chance
to be there for you.

19:14.385 --> 19:17.021
<i>(grunts)</i> yeah.
You're welcome.

19:17.022 --> 19:18.988
Now you can ship out
your orders on time,

19:18.989 --> 19:21.758
And business will take off
just like you planned.

19:23.294 --> 19:26.463
I... I'm overwhelmed.

19:26.464 --> 19:29.266
I'm standing here
surrounded by all the people

19:29.267 --> 19:32.302
That mean so much to me.

19:32.303 --> 19:34.805
Especially you, ilene.
Oh, al.

19:34.806 --> 19:38.275
No, no.
I ran away up to my cabin,

19:38.276 --> 19:40.277
And I realized I was running
away from you.

19:40.278 --> 19:43.380
And I don't need to make
a lot of money for you
to love me.

19:43.381 --> 19:45.783
You've always loved me
for who I am.

19:45.784 --> 19:47.985
And I always will.

19:47.986 --> 19:49.853
Reminds me of madame de staël,
who said,

19:49.854 --> 19:51.755
"love is above the law,
above the opinion of men;

19:51.756 --> 19:54.591
The state, the flame,
the ideal story
of the modern world."

19:54.592 --> 19:57.895
Give me the chocolate bar.

19:57.896 --> 20:01.232
Does anybody else feel
like your heart is about
to leap out of your chest?

20:01.233 --> 20:04.301
Yes. I feel like my heart is
about to leap out of my chest.

20:04.302 --> 20:07.737
And I want everybody
to hear this.

20:07.738 --> 20:11.274
Ilene, I've known
you were the one for me

20:11.275 --> 20:13.877
Ever since we teed off on
the moderate-to-difficult course

20:13.878 --> 20:16.980
At the "putt-putt panorama."

20:20.618 --> 20:23.853
Ilene markham,
will you marry me?

20:25.823 --> 20:28.592
Yes, she will!

20:29.961 --> 20:31.962
What she said!

20:33.798 --> 20:36.699
Of course I will, al.
Oh!

20:47.345 --> 20:50.680
I'm sorry. I don't even have
a ring for you.

20:50.681 --> 20:52.316
It's ok.
Oh, um, um...

20:52.317 --> 20:56.353
Wait a minute!
You can get the belt
off the little al figurine.

21:01.692 --> 21:03.927
It fits!

21:05.363 --> 21:08.197
I love you, al.
I love you, ilene.

21:13.704 --> 21:15.172
Hi.
Hi.

21:15.173 --> 21:17.674
Yesterday was al's day.
Today, it's my day.

21:17.675 --> 21:19.977
You getting married again?

21:19.978 --> 21:22.946
No, but I have a new love.

21:22.947 --> 21:25.949
I want to introduce you
to my completed chassis.

21:25.950 --> 21:28.618
And her heart is
a 250-horsepower,

21:28.619 --> 21:31.755
Ported and polished flathead.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.326
Wow!

21:36.327 --> 21:39.663
I still remember when
you started up the last one.

21:39.664 --> 21:41.999
You were there?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.735
Yes! I was standing
right next to the engine.

21:44.736 --> 21:48.471
I remember the engine,
but you're a total blank.

21:48.472 --> 21:50.373
In that case,
I'll leave the two of you alone.

21:50.374 --> 21:52.443
No, no, no.
It's very important that
you're here when I start it up.

21:52.444 --> 21:53.677
Really?
Yeah.

21:53.678 --> 21:57.181
I need somebody
to take a picture of me.

21:57.182 --> 22:01.218
I recognize the camera,
but you're a total blank.

22:01.219 --> 22:03.253
All right. Say "cheese."

22:03.254 --> 22:05.655
<i>(engine starts)</i>

22:18.636 --> 22:22.339
This is a great game.
Al's gonna make a fortune...

22:25.376 --> 22:27.444
...Or not.

22:29.147 --> 22:31.781
Move away.
<i>(director)</i> blow it, pat.
Blow it out.

22:36.287 --> 22:39.223
Thank you. We're clear. Go on.

22:39.224 --> 22:41.225
Come on! Help us!

22:41.226 --> 22:43.994
"your best days are behind you."

22:46.598 --> 22:49.366
What the hell are these -
misfortune cookies?

22:49.367 --> 22:52.135
Well, so I'm new
to the business, ok?
Ok.

22:52.136 --> 22:55.005
<i>(speaks chinese)</i>
...Smart guy.
