WEBVTT

00:07.428 --> 00:10.595
They're quite large.
Seven feet tall is not unusual.

00:10.765 --> 00:12.888
They're extremely fast and strong.

00:13.059 --> 00:14.518
Lieutenant.

00:16.813 --> 00:19.102
Make no mistake,
they can be highly dangerous.

00:20.817 --> 00:23.486
The Capellan's basic weapon:
The kligat.

00:23.653 --> 00:25.480
At any distance up to 100 yards,

00:25.655 --> 00:29.404
they can make it almost as effective
against a man as a phaser.

00:29.576 --> 00:33.241
In addition to this,
an assortment of swords and knives.

00:33.414 --> 00:34.824
Call from the Bridge, captain.

00:34.999 --> 00:36.659
Bridge. Helm, sir.

00:36.834 --> 00:38.827
Yes, Mr. Sulu. Report.

00:39.086 --> 00:42.502
Now in standard orbit, sir. I've
pinpointed their encampment below.

00:43.049 --> 00:45.291
Very good.
Have the Transporter Room stand by.

00:45.468 --> 00:47.092
Aye, sir.

00:47.512 --> 00:49.754
How long were you stationed
on the planet, Doctor?

00:49.931 --> 00:51.129
Only a few months.

00:51.307 --> 00:54.677
We found them totally uninterested
in medical aid or hospitals.

00:54.853 --> 00:57.344
They believe
that only the strong should survive.

00:58.273 --> 00:59.684
Analysis, gentlemen?

00:59.858 --> 01:01.767
Ordinarily, under these circumstances,

01:01.944 --> 01:04.516
I would recommend
a large well-armed landing party.

01:04.696 --> 01:07.235
Yes, but in this case,
with the more people we take down,

01:07.408 --> 01:09.815
the greater chance we have
of violating one of their taboos.

01:09.994 --> 01:13.410
Agreed. Once they've got it
into their heads we're showing force,

01:13.581 --> 01:15.870
you can forget them signing
any mining treaty.

01:16.042 --> 01:18.449
Very well. Scotty, you're in command.

01:18.628 --> 01:21.297
Bear in mind that the Klingons
have been sighted in this sector.

01:21.464 --> 01:24.038
While we're negotiating there,
we don't want the Enterprise

01:24.217 --> 01:28.215
- to become an incident up here.
- Aye, sir. We'll keep on our toes.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.085 --> 01:58.912
Halt!

02:03.008 --> 02:05.131
You are of the Earth vessel?

02:05.927 --> 02:07.920
I am Captain Kirk.

02:08.096 --> 02:11.762
We come with open hearts and hands.

02:13.811 --> 02:15.969
- A Klingon!
- Grant, no!

02:31.788 --> 02:35.038
Space, the final frontier.

02:40.756 --> 02:44.801
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:44.969 --> 02:48.836
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

02:49.014 --> 02:52.964
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

02:53.144 --> 02:56.061
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

03:38.191 --> 03:41.358
Captain's log, stardate 3497.2.

03:41.528 --> 03:43.106
Planet Capella IV.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.988
The rare mineral topaline

03:45.157 --> 03:47.992
vital to the life support systems
of planetoid colonies

03:48.160 --> 03:50.366
has been discovered
in abundance here.

03:50.538 --> 03:52.696
Our mission:
Obtain a mining agreement.

03:53.624 --> 03:57.159
But we've discovered a Klingon agent
has preceded us to the planet,

03:57.336 --> 04:00.373
a discovery which has cost the life
of one of my crewmen.

04:02.342 --> 04:05.627
I am unaware of any state of war
between our peoples, captain.

04:05.804 --> 04:07.381
Jim.

04:08.139 --> 04:11.224
Or is it your policy
to kill Klingons on sight?

04:16.231 --> 04:18.188
He was young...

04:19.067 --> 04:20.692
...and inexperienced.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.900
Does Maab know that the Klingons
are our sworn enemies

04:26.075 --> 04:27.486
by their own words?

04:27.660 --> 04:32.073
We understand only that he also offers
things of value for our rocks.

04:32.248 --> 04:35.000
And he has freely handed us
his weapons and other devices.

04:41.007 --> 04:42.252
Will you do the same?

04:45.887 --> 04:48.425
Let me call my ship
and inform them...

04:48.599 --> 04:51.172
To bring down an attack
upon their village?

04:51.351 --> 04:52.929
It is as I told you, Maab.

04:53.103 --> 04:55.179
Earthmen fear to bargain honestly.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.435
Will you hand us your weapons?

05:27.139 --> 05:31.303
"So they keep their word scrupulously.
They're unusually honest."

05:31.477 --> 05:34.312
Is that what I heard you say
in the Briefing Room, Doctor?

05:34.480 --> 05:35.891
Yes, I mentioned that.

05:36.065 --> 05:38.983
He also mentioned
that they can be highly dangerous.

05:39.152 --> 05:40.943
Dangerous if lied to.

05:41.112 --> 05:42.654
If their customs are violated.

05:42.822 --> 05:46.523
Well, we lied to no one, Doctor.
We violated no customs.

05:46.993 --> 05:49.152
Perhaps you'll explain to me
why one of my men is dead.

05:49.329 --> 05:51.999
Because he was drawing a weapon
on another of their guests.

05:52.165 --> 05:53.494
Grant looked up,

05:53.667 --> 05:57.831
saw a Klingon, made a purely
instinctive defensive move.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.465
What's a Klingon doing down here

06:01.634 --> 06:04.006
among your scrupulously
honest friends anyway?

06:07.849 --> 06:11.514
Look, Jim, I know what it means
to you to lose a crewman.

06:12.562 --> 06:15.183
That's only one down, Doctor.

06:15.356 --> 06:17.729
There's over 400 more
up there in orbit.

06:20.028 --> 06:22.863
And if there's a Klingon down here...

06:23.365 --> 06:27.197
...there might be a Klingon ship
up there somewhere.

06:28.036 --> 06:29.910
Mr. Scott...

06:32.416 --> 06:35.536
...picking up something
on the sensors, sir.

06:35.711 --> 06:37.170
Seems to be another ship.

06:37.338 --> 06:39.829
Let's put it on the screen.

06:43.386 --> 06:47.004
It's just at the edge
of our sensor range, sir.

06:47.891 --> 06:49.385
Hard to get an exact reading.

06:49.559 --> 06:51.386
You think it's a Klingon ship?

06:53.146 --> 06:57.061
Who else would be playing
cat and mouse with a starship?

07:00.070 --> 07:03.938
Can't hurt us much out there,
bobbing about like that.

07:05.159 --> 07:07.484
No need to call the captain yet.

07:22.761 --> 07:23.923
Bones.

07:26.181 --> 07:27.640
Yes, captain?

07:28.725 --> 07:31.299
I shouldn't have chewed you out.

07:31.478 --> 07:32.510
I'm sorry.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.939
I understand.

07:37.443 --> 07:39.851
Inefficient, however.

07:40.446 --> 07:42.771
Emotion, captain.

07:43.533 --> 07:46.617
Yes, you're quite right, Mr. Spock.

07:46.786 --> 07:48.494
Inefficient...

07:49.914 --> 07:51.574
...and illogical.

07:59.508 --> 08:04.549
You've shown friendship
by handing over our weapons.

08:04.722 --> 08:07.639
And she's making a gesture in return.

08:11.896 --> 08:13.438
Jim.

08:17.652 --> 08:19.146
If you touch it,

08:19.320 --> 08:22.820
her nearest male relative
will have to try to kill you.

08:23.199 --> 08:25.951
They're offering you a chance
for combat.

08:26.202 --> 08:28.444
They consider it more pleasurable
than love.

08:39.674 --> 08:44.337
It would appear, captain,
that he finds you a disappointment.

08:57.986 --> 09:00.773
I am the Teer, Akaar.

09:00.947 --> 09:03.901
I lead the Ten Tribes of Capella.

09:11.542 --> 09:13.499
And this is Eleen.

09:13.669 --> 09:15.128
A young wife,

09:15.296 --> 09:18.499
to give an old man a son
to rule these tribes.

09:18.674 --> 09:20.714
I'm Captain Kirk.

09:20.885 --> 09:23.043
First, I must protest
the killing of one of my crewmen.

09:23.221 --> 09:26.886
If it was your man, was it not
his privilege to die for you?

09:27.058 --> 09:30.392
- I do not understand.
- Their customs are different, Teer.

09:30.562 --> 09:33.896
And different from those
of my people too, Teer.

09:34.065 --> 09:35.892
The sight of death frightens them.

09:36.068 --> 09:38.191
Let me take this, Jim.

09:40.989 --> 09:43.528
What Maab has said is true.

09:43.701 --> 09:46.073
Our customs are different.

09:47.037 --> 09:50.371
What the Klingon has said
is unimportant,

09:50.541 --> 09:52.581
and we do not hear his words.

09:56.339 --> 09:58.747
I just called the Klingon a liar.

09:58.925 --> 10:00.253
Laughter, Teer?

10:00.427 --> 10:02.918
Is not the Klingon
an honoured guest also?

10:03.179 --> 10:06.346
It is the Earth people
who first bargained for our rocks.

10:06.516 --> 10:09.767
Is it not best to have
two who bargain for the same goods?

10:09.937 --> 10:15.180
- It is I who speak for the tribe, Maab.
- I speak for many, Teer.

10:15.776 --> 10:17.603
Hear the words of the Klingon.

10:19.780 --> 10:22.188
What do Earthmen offer you?

10:23.075 --> 10:25.993
What have you obtained from them
in the past?

10:27.497 --> 10:30.782
Powders and liquids for the sick?

10:33.128 --> 10:35.666
We Klingons believe as you do.

10:35.839 --> 10:37.214
The sick should die.

10:38.008 --> 10:40.047
Only the strong should live.

10:40.260 --> 10:44.258
Earthmen have promised to teach
the youth of your tribes many things.

10:45.390 --> 10:49.009
What? What things?

10:49.812 --> 10:52.220
Cleverness against enemies?

10:52.648 --> 10:57.643
- The use of weapons?
- The Klingon speaks the truth, Akaar.

11:03.576 --> 11:09.081
The Earth Federation offers
one other thing, Akaar.

11:09.958 --> 11:14.585
Our laws. And the highest
of all our laws states:

11:14.755 --> 11:18.835
Your world is yours,
and will always remain yours.

11:19.009 --> 11:21.583
This differs us from the Klingons.

11:21.762 --> 11:24.134
Their empire is made up
of conquered worlds.

11:24.306 --> 11:26.216
They take what they want
by arms and force.

11:26.392 --> 11:27.507
Good.

11:27.852 --> 11:30.936
Let the Klingons and the Earthmen
offer us amusement.

11:31.105 --> 11:32.481
Capellans welcome this.

11:32.649 --> 11:35.484
The Earthmen have different customs.

11:35.944 --> 11:37.853
But never have they lied to our people.

11:38.029 --> 11:41.114
There are those of us who will
not bargain with Earthmen, Akaar.

11:44.661 --> 11:48.030
Do you say you will fight me, Maab?

11:53.796 --> 11:56.369
Let that be your choice, Teer.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.433
We need our communicators,
those devices on our belts.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.517
If there's a Klingon ship somewhere...

12:14.693 --> 12:17.018
The sky does not interest me.

12:17.863 --> 12:20.817
I must consider
the words I have heard.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.741
Leave him.

12:46.268 --> 12:49.886
The ship's disappeared, sir.
Gone out of range.

12:53.108 --> 12:56.109
Mr. Scott, I'm getting a call
from a vessel.

12:56.278 --> 12:58.022
So faint I can't make it out.

12:58.197 --> 13:01.281
Put a booster on it, Lieutenant.
Try to pull it in.

13:02.618 --> 13:04.492
I've lost it.

13:04.662 --> 13:07.580
It sounded like a distress signal
from an Earth vessel.

13:59.470 --> 14:01.261
Klingon!

14:02.181 --> 14:03.841
Communicators. Weapons.

14:04.099 --> 14:07.682
I have no quarrel with you, captain.
I wish merely to...

14:08.813 --> 14:10.473
...return to my vessel.

14:14.861 --> 14:17.316
Type of vessel? Location?

14:17.489 --> 14:19.861
A small scout ship, captain.

14:20.951 --> 14:23.406
We need the mineral too.

14:23.578 --> 14:25.951
I was sent to negotiate.

14:26.123 --> 14:27.783
Release him.

14:42.223 --> 14:43.883
Akaar is dead.

14:45.893 --> 14:47.720
I am the Teer.

14:47.896 --> 14:50.221
- Kill them now.
- Wait!

14:55.153 --> 14:59.233
If you lead these people now, be
certain you make the right decisions.

15:01.410 --> 15:04.530
Is the new leader
of the Ten Tribes afraid?

15:05.205 --> 15:08.325
- Let me kill them for you.
- Or let the Klingon and me fight.

15:08.584 --> 15:10.411
It might amuse you.

15:14.131 --> 15:17.750
Perhaps to be a Teer
is to see in new ways.

15:20.013 --> 15:22.420
I begin to like you, Earthman.

15:23.433 --> 15:26.600
And I saw fear in the Klingon's eye.

15:27.604 --> 15:29.727
We had an agreement.

15:33.610 --> 15:35.936
That too, may change, Klingon.

15:40.701 --> 15:43.619
I have the signal clear now, Mr. Scott.
It is a distress call.

15:43.788 --> 15:46.195
It's from the SS Dierdre.

15:46.374 --> 15:48.912
Dierdre. That's a freighter.

15:49.085 --> 15:54.292
Reporting they're under attack.
They're running, trying to manoeuvre.

15:54.466 --> 15:57.336
It's a Klingon vessel attacking.

16:00.222 --> 16:04.848
- Helm?
- Picking it up, sir. Taking a fix.

16:05.936 --> 16:07.727
Try the captain.

16:07.896 --> 16:11.846
Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
Come in, captain.

16:12.818 --> 16:15.107
Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
Come in, captain.

16:26.749 --> 16:28.908
Captain, careful.

16:32.756 --> 16:37.217
- You carry a child who would be Teer.
- I must die.

16:41.765 --> 16:42.797
No!

17:14.758 --> 17:17.510
No man may touch the wife of a Teer.

17:20.222 --> 17:23.058
She was prepared to die, Earthman.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.352
I was proud to obey the laws.

17:27.730 --> 17:29.972
Kill him first.

17:31.276 --> 17:33.518
He laid hands upon me.

17:34.195 --> 17:36.734
It is my right to see him die.

17:43.038 --> 17:45.327
Enterprise to Mr. Spock.

17:46.917 --> 17:50.037
Dr. McCoy, come in please.

17:54.258 --> 17:57.877
I have it on the sensors, sir.
Tie into my channel, lieutenant.

17:58.054 --> 17:59.085
Tied in.

17:59.263 --> 18:02.265
... commanding. We are under
heavy attack by Klingon vessels.

18:02.433 --> 18:04.592
Two convoy ships
are already damaged.

18:04.769 --> 18:07.521
We must have help.
Enterprise, acknowledge.

18:07.689 --> 18:09.931
Please acknowledge. Repeat...

18:17.449 --> 18:21.661
Interception course computed
and laid in, sir.

18:21.829 --> 18:24.830
Prepare to take us out of orbit,
Mr. Sulu.

18:25.875 --> 18:27.535
Aye, sir.

18:31.631 --> 18:33.540
Scotty, the captain...

18:33.716 --> 18:37.168
We have a distress call
from a Federation ship under attack.

18:37.345 --> 18:39.634
That's where our duty lies.

18:45.479 --> 18:49.429
Take us out of orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Ahead warp 5.

19:03.373 --> 19:05.780
Captain's log, stardate 3498.9.

19:05.959 --> 19:08.247
Lieutenant Commander Scott
in temporary command.

19:08.795 --> 19:12.081
We were forced to leave Capella to
come to the aid of a Federation vessel

19:12.257 --> 19:14.878
under attack by a Klingon vessel.

19:21.683 --> 19:24.139
We were unable to contact
our landing party

19:24.311 --> 19:27.562
before we were forced to answer
the distress signal.

19:27.732 --> 19:31.350
Our inability to reach
the landing party is strange,

19:31.527 --> 19:34.314
and I am concerned.

19:35.406 --> 19:40.781
Our check-in signal
is one hour 12 minutes overdue.

19:41.329 --> 19:44.164
Since no reconnaissance party
has appeared,

19:44.332 --> 19:47.998
and since Mr. Scott is notably efficient
in such matters...

19:48.170 --> 19:51.705
I must assume that something's
keeping them busy up there.

19:51.882 --> 19:53.791
The Klingon ship.

19:54.968 --> 19:58.420
That would seem a logical conclusion.

19:59.765 --> 20:01.557
Captain...

20:01.726 --> 20:04.098
...l'm gonna fix that woman's arm.

20:04.478 --> 20:07.729
They can only kill me once
for touching her.

20:11.611 --> 20:15.360
That's a very good idea, Bones.

20:15.532 --> 20:19.696
Yes, captain. An excellent idea.

20:27.086 --> 20:29.411
Let me see that arm.

20:29.588 --> 20:31.581
You will not touch me.

20:40.725 --> 20:43.097
You said you were prepared to die.

20:43.269 --> 20:45.428
Does that mean you prefer to die?

20:45.605 --> 20:49.520
I think we can get you safely
to the ship. Your choice.

20:51.903 --> 20:55.818
To live is always desirable.

20:57.951 --> 20:59.778
All right, let's go.

21:13.259 --> 21:14.801
Klingon.

21:17.180 --> 21:20.216
There is nothing
to concern you there.

21:26.398 --> 21:30.977
We made an agreement, Maab.
I have a right to my weapons.

21:32.780 --> 21:35.235
We have them well cared for, Klingon.

21:35.491 --> 21:39.785
Your weapon will be returned
when our business is completed.

21:41.205 --> 21:43.079
That was our agreement.

21:43.332 --> 21:46.583
Aft phaser, affirmative.
We're going to bridge.

21:46.836 --> 21:49.671
Approaching the freighter's
last reported position, sir.

21:49.839 --> 21:51.832
Sensor report, Mr. Chekov?

21:52.008 --> 21:55.294
Negative, sir. No debris,
no residual particles.

21:55.470 --> 21:56.502
No traces.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.681
Mr. Sulu, begin
a standard search pattern.

21:59.850 --> 22:03.053
All scanners full intensity,
Mr. Chekov.

22:04.063 --> 22:06.850
- No signal at all?
- Negative, sir.

22:07.024 --> 22:08.981
It should be on our screens by now.

22:09.151 --> 22:12.022
At best a freighter
might travel warp two.

22:13.114 --> 22:17.278
I'm well aware of a freighter's
maximum speed, Mr. Sulu.

22:23.500 --> 22:26.205
Captain's log, stardate 3499.1.

22:27.003 --> 22:28.996
Before leaving
the Capellan encampment,

22:29.172 --> 22:31.628
we managed to retrieve
our communicators.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.544
Our phasers were not to be found.

22:33.719 --> 22:37.384
We have fled into the hills, yet we know
the Capellans will eventually find us

22:37.556 --> 22:39.596
by scent alone, if necessary.

22:39.934 --> 22:41.725
And we have learned one thing more.

22:41.894 --> 22:46.687
The girl, Eleen, hates the unborn child
she is carrying.

22:46.858 --> 22:48.731
Stay with her, Bones.

22:55.825 --> 22:57.948
Nice place to get trapped in.

22:58.119 --> 23:00.029
But a defensible entrance, captain.

23:04.668 --> 23:06.162
Yes, I see.

23:06.837 --> 23:10.253
Scout up the trail that way.
See what we have in the way of an exit.

23:10.424 --> 23:12.832
I'll take a look around.

23:13.010 --> 23:14.884
Now listen, you may be
a Capellan woman

23:15.054 --> 23:16.928
and the widow of a High Teer.

23:17.098 --> 23:21.594
But I'm a doctor, and it's my tradition
to care for the sick and injured.

23:27.776 --> 23:30.943
Now let me see that arm.

24:16.869 --> 24:21.330
- You will not touch me in that manner.
- Now you listen to me, young woman.

24:21.499 --> 24:26.291
I'll touch you in any way or manner that
my professional judgement indicates.

24:42.521 --> 24:44.679
Just as I thought.

24:44.857 --> 24:47.774
It can come any time now.

24:47.943 --> 24:50.185
How do you know?

24:50.780 --> 24:54.030
Because I'm a doctor,
that's how I know.

24:56.285 --> 25:00.615
Even the women of our village
cannot tell so much with a touch.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.202
Strange hand.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.831
Very soft.

25:29.904 --> 25:32.905
The walls get higher and narrower,
but there is a way out.

25:33.074 --> 25:34.272
Good.

25:34.451 --> 25:36.906
If we could block off that entrance,
it'd give us more time.

25:37.078 --> 25:40.578
- They'd have to go around these hills.
- There's enough loose rock and shale.

25:40.749 --> 25:42.907
Do you think we could create
a sonic disruption

25:43.085 --> 25:44.627
with two of our communicators?

25:44.795 --> 25:46.918
Only a very slight chance
it would work.

25:47.089 --> 25:50.125
Well, if you don't think we can,
maybe we shouldn't try.

25:50.301 --> 25:52.756
I didn't say that exactly.

26:16.119 --> 26:18.990
Sound beams should produce
a sympathetic vibration...

26:20.290 --> 26:22.995
...on the weak area of that slide.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.989
Worried about the delivery?

28:19.165 --> 28:21.075
Capellans aren't human, Jim.
They're humanoid.

28:21.251 --> 28:22.911
There are certain internal differences.

28:23.086 --> 28:25.209
I don't have the equipment
to handle an emergency.

28:25.380 --> 28:28.334
- If you don't think you can handle it...
- Forget it. I can do it.

28:28.509 --> 28:32.672
The last thing I want around
is a ham-handed ship's captain.

29:25.193 --> 29:28.728
No! Only McCoy.

29:29.364 --> 29:33.196
There's a cave in there.
Probably the only shelter around here.

29:33.368 --> 29:35.492
I'll need help getting her in there.

29:36.622 --> 29:38.282
No!

29:39.083 --> 29:43.828
Look, I'm a doctor, not an escalator.
Spock! Give me a hand!

29:45.339 --> 29:48.673
I will allow only your touch.

30:07.196 --> 30:10.363
A vessel doesn't just disappear.

30:13.202 --> 30:17.580
There's nothing, Mr. Scott.
All channels and frequencies are clear.

30:20.209 --> 30:22.617
Mr. Chekov?

30:22.795 --> 30:24.124
Nothing, sir.

30:24.297 --> 30:28.876
If it were destroyed, I'd pick up
debris readings of some sort.

30:36.560 --> 30:40.225
It couldn't have run away from us, sir.
Not a freighter.

30:46.779 --> 30:51.940
Mr. Chekov, pull the microtape
on that distress call. I want it replayed.

30:59.167 --> 31:02.417
... commanding. We are under
heavy attack by Klingon vessels.

31:02.587 --> 31:04.710
Two convoy ships
are already damaged.

31:04.881 --> 31:07.586
We must have help!
Enterprise, acknowledge.

31:07.759 --> 31:10.001
- Please acknowledge.
- Did you hear it?

31:10.262 --> 31:11.721
They called us by name.

31:11.889 --> 31:15.174
Not a general distress signal,
but one aimed right at us.

31:16.060 --> 31:18.183
Wouldn't they normally call
for the nearest starship?

31:19.772 --> 31:23.722
How would a freighter know
we were ordered into this sector?

31:24.527 --> 31:26.152
Trap.

31:26.487 --> 31:27.898
We were diverted from the planet.

31:32.661 --> 31:36.326
Or it could be
an authentic distress call.

31:36.832 --> 31:39.702
We'll stay long enough
to make certain.

31:40.252 --> 31:44.581
- Continue search pattern.
- Yes, sir. Continuing.

31:56.561 --> 31:58.055
Bones?

31:58.229 --> 32:00.803
You've got one of those
magnesite-nitron tablets in your kit.

32:00.982 --> 32:02.180
- Give me one.
- Just a minute.

32:02.358 --> 32:04.316
Let me get her on the rock.

32:26.384 --> 32:28.839
Pain is here.

32:35.769 --> 32:39.138
How did you arrange to touch her,
Bones? Give her a happy pill?

32:39.314 --> 32:42.101
No. Right cross.

32:43.318 --> 32:46.770
- Never seen that in a medical book.
- It's in mine from now on.

32:54.705 --> 32:58.205
No, it's there.

33:00.503 --> 33:02.709
Pain is there.

33:07.844 --> 33:10.881
Vegetation, captain.
Evidently there's water nearby.

33:11.056 --> 33:15.101
Good. But we need weapons just
as much as we need water, Spock.

33:15.269 --> 33:19.053
There would seem to be
little weapon potential at hand.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.891
Follow me.

33:25.196 --> 33:28.066
McCoy!

33:28.991 --> 33:31.992
Easy. I'm here.

33:34.747 --> 33:37.914
You must want the child.

33:38.084 --> 33:40.243
No.

33:41.963 --> 33:46.672
Here child belongs to husband.

33:48.262 --> 33:52.591
So they take
all the credit here. Poppycock!

33:52.766 --> 33:54.676
Answer me. Do you want my help?

33:58.230 --> 34:01.185
Answer me. Do you want my help?

34:05.238 --> 34:07.065
All right.

34:07.240 --> 34:10.275
Say to yourself, "The child is mine.

34:10.452 --> 34:13.406
The child is mine. It is mine."

34:14.080 --> 34:16.618
Yes. It's yours.

34:17.458 --> 34:20.032
No. You've got it all wrong.

34:21.338 --> 34:24.790
Yes, McCoy.

34:27.636 --> 34:28.833
It's yours.

34:29.013 --> 34:32.797
No. Say to yourself,
"The child is mine.

34:32.975 --> 34:36.012
It is mine. It is..."

34:48.241 --> 34:50.483
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.

34:50.659 --> 34:53.199
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.

35:04.759 --> 35:07.760
Fortunately this bark
has suitable tensile cohesion.

35:07.929 --> 35:10.171
You mean it makes
a good bow string?

35:10.348 --> 35:12.673
I believe I said that.

35:16.104 --> 35:18.227
That's more like it.

35:22.152 --> 35:24.524
Since the Capellans
never developed the bow,

35:24.696 --> 35:28.445
this may come as big a surprise
as gunpowder was on Earth.

36:07.032 --> 36:08.693
No, Mr. Spock. That isn't the way.

36:08.868 --> 36:11.074
You place this arm under here
to support its back,

36:11.245 --> 36:13.037
and this hand here,
to support its head.

36:13.206 --> 36:16.242
I would rather not, thank you.

36:17.085 --> 36:18.828
McCoy.

36:19.170 --> 36:21.875
Bring our child.

36:23.717 --> 36:25.508
"Our" child?

36:27.763 --> 36:31.974
- I'll explain later.
- That should prove very interesting.

36:55.750 --> 36:58.835
Still negative, Mr. Scott. All sweeps.

36:59.004 --> 37:01.875
- Mr. Chekov?
- Nothing.

37:02.299 --> 37:06.083
- We're turning back. Warp five, helm.
- Warp five, sir.

37:10.933 --> 37:12.308
On course for Capella IV.

37:12.476 --> 37:14.303
Warp 6 as soon as she'll take it,
Mr. Sulu.

37:14.478 --> 37:17.017
The captain could be in trouble
back there.

37:17.190 --> 37:20.523
Mr. Scott. Another distress call
from the USS Carolina.

37:20.693 --> 37:21.725
Ignore it.

37:21.903 --> 37:24.359
Mr. Scott, the Carolina
is registered in this sector.

37:24.531 --> 37:27.448
Ignore it, lieutenant.
Log it as my order, my responsibility.

37:27.617 --> 37:29.159
Aye, aye, sir.

37:29.327 --> 37:32.328
Scotty, if it should turn out to be real...

37:32.497 --> 37:35.285
There's an old, old saying on Earth,
Mr. Sulu:

37:35.459 --> 37:39.836
"Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me."

37:40.506 --> 37:43.626
I know this saying.
It was invented in Russia.

38:35.731 --> 38:37.225
Jim!

38:37.899 --> 38:39.442
Spock!

38:42.571 --> 38:45.027
Jim! Spock!

38:47.076 --> 38:48.535
What happened, Bones?

38:48.703 --> 38:51.657
My patient spattered me with a rock.
She's gone.

38:51.831 --> 38:55.247
- The child?
- It's all right. It's in there.

38:55.418 --> 38:59.665
I guess I'll forget psychiatry,
stick with surgery.

39:00.381 --> 39:04.842
- I really thought she'd learn to want it.
- Virtue is a relative term, Doctor.

39:05.011 --> 39:07.847
- She'll head straight to the warriors.
- I'll go with you.

39:09.683 --> 39:12.435
You took a medical oath long
before you signed aboard my ship.

39:12.603 --> 39:15.094
That small patient in there needs you.

39:28.369 --> 39:31.821
- Estimating the planet?
- Thirty-one minutes, sir.

39:32.749 --> 39:35.205
Scanner to Bridge. Read.
Engineering control.

39:35.377 --> 39:37.369
Mr. Scott.

39:41.341 --> 39:44.426
Sensors picking up a vessel ahead.

39:44.595 --> 39:47.216
Cutting across our path.

39:47.389 --> 39:51.387
- Sub-light, one half.
- Reversing to sub-light. One half.

39:51.811 --> 39:53.720
It's an alien, sir.

39:54.397 --> 39:58.441
By configuration, a Klingon warship.

39:59.110 --> 40:03.439
Taking position directly in our path.

40:03.823 --> 40:07.655
- Mr. Sulu, sound battle stations.
- Aye, aye, sir.

40:27.556 --> 40:31.851
This is the USS Enterprise calling
unidentified Klingon vessel. Come in.

40:36.024 --> 40:39.856
USS Enterprise calling
Klingon vessel. Acknowledge, please.

40:43.031 --> 40:46.032
I have it on the viewscreen now, sir.
Still distant.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.987
Holding a position dead ahead, sir.

40:52.333 --> 40:55.452
Drawing a line,
daring us to step over it.

40:57.546 --> 40:59.504
Still closing.

40:59.715 --> 41:02.337
The alien is directly in our line of flight.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.886
This is the commander
of the USS Enterprise.

41:11.061 --> 41:13.552
Identify yourself and your intention.

41:13.730 --> 41:14.893
Acknowledge.

41:21.113 --> 41:23.984
Close out the frequency, lieutenant.

41:24.366 --> 41:26.442
Phaser banks are ready, sir.

41:26.619 --> 41:30.569
And we'll go right down their throat,
if necessary.

41:31.332 --> 41:34.535
Let's see if they have the belly for it.

42:22.761 --> 42:25.513
Behind the rocks up there.

42:26.765 --> 42:29.636
The Earthmen make excellent game.

42:29.810 --> 42:33.013
Their cleverness has surprised me.

42:33.189 --> 42:35.146
They must die.

42:36.609 --> 42:38.566
That is your law.

42:39.153 --> 42:43.103
We will honour our law
and our word to you, Klingon.

42:43.283 --> 42:44.991
Maab.

43:04.305 --> 43:06.594
The child is dead, Maab.

43:09.310 --> 43:11.386
Do as you will with me.

43:11.938 --> 43:13.930
The Earthmen?

43:14.107 --> 43:15.980
Dead.

43:16.442 --> 43:18.850
I killed them as they slept.

43:22.949 --> 43:26.235
If true, take us to them.

43:27.371 --> 43:30.372
Do you doubt my word, Klingon?

43:30.541 --> 43:32.996
I am the wife of a Teer.

43:33.168 --> 43:36.039
I will die in my own tent.

43:40.718 --> 43:44.004
It is in order.
She is the wife of a Teer.

43:46.557 --> 43:49.891
No! First we verify her story!

43:50.061 --> 43:52.683
Is this what
your sworn word means, Klingon?

44:30.979 --> 44:32.604
Spock?

44:35.317 --> 44:36.692
Here, captain.

44:40.281 --> 44:41.989
Over here, captain.

44:45.953 --> 44:48.029
Spock to Enterprise.

44:52.293 --> 44:55.876
The cavalry doesn't come over the hill
in the nick of time any more.

44:56.047 --> 44:59.582
If by that you mean we can't expect
help from the Enterprise, I must agree.

45:07.142 --> 45:10.143
There's just one thing I want.

45:10.312 --> 45:12.056
The Klingon?

45:12.231 --> 45:14.105
One of us must get him.

45:14.316 --> 45:16.439
Revenge, captain?

45:18.487 --> 45:19.602
Why not?

45:19.780 --> 45:23.648
The next man who raises a weapon
destroys all of you.

45:24.327 --> 45:27.328
You and your primitive knives
and your weapons!

45:27.497 --> 45:29.655
I'll teach you what killing really means.

45:30.417 --> 45:32.160
Klingon!

45:38.217 --> 45:39.925
Fight!

45:40.928 --> 45:43.763
Are you warriors or children?

45:44.849 --> 45:47.340
Maab. I will flee.

45:47.518 --> 45:50.804
When the Klingon turns to fire, I'll...

45:52.315 --> 45:57.226
As Teer of the Ten Tribes,
I give you back your life.

45:57.403 --> 45:59.230
Mine is now forfeit.

46:00.699 --> 46:03.902
Keel, stand ready.

46:12.377 --> 46:14.204
Klingon!

47:11.356 --> 47:14.310
Hold it there! Drop your weapons!

47:31.711 --> 47:32.874
We missed you, Mr. Scott.

47:33.046 --> 47:35.963
We had a wee bit of a run-in
with a Klingon vessel

47:36.132 --> 47:37.543
but he had no stomach for fighting.

47:37.717 --> 47:40.006
We checked the encampment,
found out you were here

47:40.178 --> 47:43.962
and had no trouble at all
in tracking you down. I could...

47:44.182 --> 47:46.720
No, that's not the way to handle it.
Here, like this.

47:47.144 --> 47:49.183
Here, take its little head like that.

47:49.354 --> 47:53.222
There. Arm under, that's it.
See how easy?

48:00.324 --> 48:03.325
"Oochy-woochy-kootchy-coo," captain?

48:03.494 --> 48:05.570
An obscure Earth dialect, Mr. Spock.

48:06.831 --> 48:09.702
If you're curious, consult linguistics.

48:10.835 --> 48:12.662
At any rate,
this should prove interesting.

48:12.837 --> 48:13.869
Interesting?

48:14.047 --> 48:16.503
When the woman starts explaining
how the new High Teer

48:16.675 --> 48:18.502
is actually Dr. McCoy's child.

48:18.677 --> 48:19.875
What's that again, Mr. Spock?

48:20.053 --> 48:22.379
We don't actually understand it
ourselves, Mr. Scott.

48:22.556 --> 48:24.465
Nor does Dr. McCoy.

48:35.528 --> 48:37.984
Contact Starfleet.

48:38.156 --> 48:40.398
Inform them that Federation
mining rights on Capella

48:40.575 --> 48:41.903
have been secured by treaty.

48:42.077 --> 48:44.484
Documents signed
by the young High Chief's regent.

48:44.663 --> 48:47.284
- Report follows.
- Aye, aye, sir.

48:48.208 --> 48:53.001
- The child's regent?
- Yes. Eleen. A remarkable young lady.

48:53.172 --> 48:55.295
Representing the High Teer,

48:55.716 --> 48:58.385
Leonard James Akaar.

48:58.761 --> 49:02.177
The child was named
Leonard James Akaar?

49:03.182 --> 49:05.887
Has a kind of a ring to it,
don't you think, James?

49:06.060 --> 49:08.812
I think it's a name destined to go down
in galactic history, Leonard.

49:08.980 --> 49:11.222
- What do you think, Spock?
- I think you're both gonna be

49:11.399 --> 49:15.100
insufferably pleased with yourselves
for at least a month, sir.

49:20.867 --> 49:23.405
Take us out of orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Ahead, warp factor one.

49:24.305 --> 49:30.280
