01:00.158 --> 01:03.526
And now, the last finalist,

01:03.563 --> 01:09.059
three-time champion
Charlyne Phuc.

01:14.776 --> 01:16.573
Excuse me.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.310
Ah!

01:20.349 --> 01:23.148
First word: Logorrhea.

01:28.192 --> 01:29.716
Logorrhea, um...

01:29.760 --> 01:32.992
L- o-g-o-r-r...

01:33.031 --> 01:37.196
w- wait...

01:39.706 --> 01:41.197
Logorrhea...

01:41.242 --> 01:44.803
like diarrhea, but different.

01:44.845 --> 01:49.715
I mean, they're both
kind of like a spray,

01:49.751 --> 01:53.119
but logorrhea,
that's a spray of words

01:53.156 --> 01:54.681
from the mouth, you know?

01:54.725 --> 01:58.422
And, like, diarrhea,
which is also a spray,

01:58.462 --> 02:02.297
but it comes
from a different orifice.

02:02.333 --> 02:04.427
What in the world?

02:04.470 --> 02:05.664
Ugh.

02:09.943 --> 02:12.537
Fuck, am I, like, way off?

02:14.015 --> 02:15.642
There is breaking news tonight

02:15.683 --> 02:17.810
from the State Spelling Bee
Championship

02:17.852 --> 02:20.287
as Morgan High's own
Charlyne Phuc has been arrested

02:20.322 --> 02:21.653
for drug possession.

02:21.690 --> 02:23.522
Phuc has admitted
using marijuana

02:23.560 --> 02:26.120
during her three-time
championship run

02:26.162 --> 02:29.064
in order to assist her mortal mind

02:29.099 --> 02:31.260
in accessing
the dictionary inscribed

02:31.302 --> 02:33.237
in the fabric of the cosmos...

02:33.271 --> 02:35.205
And that no one would have noticed

02:35.240 --> 02:38.233
if she hadrt been so buttstonked.

02:40.913 --> 02:43.906
Shh.

02:45.419 --> 02:48.082
Shut up, Dave.

02:48.122 --> 02:49.987
Sh... shut up, Dave.

02:53.996 --> 02:57.797
# The wind blows cool
across my face... #

02:57.834 --> 02:59.665
Dave, take my weed.

03:00.670 --> 03:04.334
# I can smell the taste,
a trace of lace #

03:06.845 --> 03:09.643
# There's something
sinister in place... #

03:09.681 --> 03:13.379
- Hold his feet.
- I am, Dave.

03:13.419 --> 03:15.911
- Dave, roll that shit.
- I am, Dave.

03:17.524 --> 03:20.517
- Holy...
- Fuck.

03:20.562 --> 03:22.962
Hey, Mom? I got some
MIT scholarship stuff that I filled out.

03:22.998 --> 03:24.488
If you could drop it in the mail,
I'd appreciate it.

03:24.532 --> 03:26.592
Honey,
I clogged the toilet again.

03:26.636 --> 03:28.661
The plunger should be
under the sink.

03:28.704 --> 03:29.899
- Where?
- The back.

03:29.940 --> 03:32.966
- Oh, I... I got it.
- All right, thanks.

03:34.812 --> 03:37.508
- I love you.
- # My mind slips further #

03:37.548 --> 03:39.073
# From what's real #

03:41.920 --> 03:45.550
# Take my hands away
from the steering wheel... #

03:47.961 --> 03:51.125
# I'm crashing,
coming down in waves #

03:51.165 --> 03:54.829
# And wipe the sweat
from upon my face #

03:54.870 --> 03:59.831
# And it's a perfect day
to leave this place... #

04:01.411 --> 04:03.175
- Ooh.
- # It's a perfect day #

04:03.213 --> 04:05.647
# To hide down
in my own home... #

04:05.683 --> 04:07.173
What the fuck?!

04:07.217 --> 04:09.709
Watch where
the fuck you step, Henry!

04:09.754 --> 04:12.087
Watch where the fuck you step!

04:15.227 --> 04:17.661
# It's a perfect day #

04:17.697 --> 04:19.632
# To waste away... #

04:19.666 --> 04:22.602
# Your perfect part to play... #

04:22.637 --> 04:27.598
# Just another perfect day,
but before you know, it's gone... #

04:29.745 --> 04:32.647
# It's a perfect day to waste away #

04:32.682 --> 04:35.344
- # Your perfect part to play... #
- Shit.

04:35.385 --> 04:40.757
# Just another perfect day,
but before you know, it's gone. #

04:47.433 --> 04:50.096
Oh!

04:52.573 --> 04:54.097
Bravo, fuckers.

04:54.141 --> 04:55.734
"I swallow."

04:57.512 --> 04:59.412
Shut up.

04:59.447 --> 05:02.315
D- Dad. No...

05:02.351 --> 05:04.411
- It won't happen again. I promise.
- I expect you to pay

05:04.454 --> 05:06.786
every last penny
of my deductible.

05:06.823 --> 05:10.089
In the meantime, you can spend
this afternoon in detention.

05:10.128 --> 05:11.959
Yes, sir.

05:14.299 --> 05:16.767
- Come along, Martin.
- Yes, Daddy.

05:22.442 --> 05:23.967
Hey.

05:24.011 --> 05:26.707
Hey, Breaux.
I hit Dr. Gordon because of you.

05:27.715 --> 05:29.445
I shouldn't have to pay
for his car, man.

05:29.484 --> 05:30.974
All right, well, tough shit.
I mean, you're the one who crashed

05:31.019 --> 05:32.817
- into that butthole Gordon.
- To avoid hitting you!

05:32.855 --> 05:34.914
News flash: Wearing headphones
while driving is against the law.

05:34.957 --> 05:38.325
You know, I don't think I should take
behavior advice from a burner flunky.

05:38.362 --> 05:40.262
- Ouch, dude!
- Yeah, well, why don't you take

05:40.297 --> 05:42.163
your science-fair,
national-scholar status

05:42.200 --> 05:43.599
and cram it up your asshole?

05:43.635 --> 05:45.398
You know, Breaux...

05:45.437 --> 05:47.668
Yeah, thank you.

05:48.707 --> 05:50.504
Way to be a hambro.

05:50.543 --> 05:53.445
It wasrt like I made him crash into
that man-whore's piece-of-shit car.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.107
That's what that scrotum

05:55.148 --> 05:56.878
skin tag Gordon gets
for teaching his fat little clone

05:56.918 --> 05:58.249
how to give a hand job.

05:58.286 --> 06:00.720
Rollir on 12s, son.

06:03.025 --> 06:05.550
Aw, come on.

06:05.594 --> 06:07.859
He's behind you!

06:07.897 --> 06:10.799
What?

06:10.835 --> 06:12.403
What?

06:13.871 --> 06:15.464
You know what
the problem is here, Brandon?

06:15.507 --> 06:18.499
Why our average GPA has dropped

06:18.543 --> 06:20.842
three times in as many years?

06:20.880 --> 06:23.508
Uh, the Internet?

06:23.549 --> 06:26.144
The sticky green.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.882
The cannabis sativa.
The sinsemilla.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.914
Marijuana?

06:32.961 --> 06:36.591
Which is serious stuff.

06:36.632 --> 06:39.158
Dangerous stuff, so I hear.
It's a gateway drug.

06:39.202 --> 06:42.069
Hop-heads like Travis Breaux
have been a thorn on my side

06:42.105 --> 06:44.165
ever since they came here.

06:44.208 --> 06:47.405
That little prick has caused me
more pain than you know.

06:48.914 --> 06:52.543
- My cat...
- Yeah?

06:53.586 --> 06:55.952
...developed an abscess on her face.

06:55.989 --> 06:58.288
I rushed her to the vet
emergency room,

06:58.325 --> 07:02.056
but their nitrous oxide tank
had been stolen.

07:02.096 --> 07:04.793
They later tracked the culprits down

07:04.833 --> 07:09.362
to the home of one Travis Breaux.

07:09.405 --> 07:12.603
Without anesthesia,
I had to pin Dolly down.

07:12.643 --> 07:15.373
She scratched my face, my hand.

07:15.412 --> 07:17.506
I developed a terrible infection.

07:17.549 --> 07:19.483
It's called "cat scratch fever."

07:19.517 --> 07:21.075
My stool became

07:21.119 --> 07:22.610
incredibly painful to pass.

07:22.655 --> 07:24.646
I lost weight, but gained body fat.

07:24.690 --> 07:26.282
I was a mess.

07:26.325 --> 07:30.922
Then I heard my wife telling
her friends that I looked lousy.

07:36.071 --> 07:39.507
My attorney advised me against
taking any sort of action.

07:39.541 --> 07:43.444
No evidence to press charges
against Travis Breaux,

07:43.479 --> 07:47.439
but I knew... I knew
he was responsible,

07:47.484 --> 07:50.477
breathing in that laughing gas filth.

07:52.257 --> 07:55.523
They call it "space surfing."

07:57.396 --> 08:00.594
Where do they come up
with all these clever names

08:00.634 --> 08:02.727
for recreational drug use?

08:04.839 --> 08:08.536
Roasting a bone,
candy flipping,

08:08.576 --> 08:10.738
banging down a stiff loosey.

08:10.779 --> 08:13.509
A stiff loosey...

08:14.651 --> 08:17.313
I haven't heard that one.

08:17.354 --> 08:21.052
When a woman from
a sordid underworld social circle

08:21.092 --> 08:24.893
inales powdered cocaine
off of some loser's erect penis

08:24.930 --> 08:28.560
and then doses acid
off of his testicles...

08:30.737 --> 08:32.933
I think it has something
to do with the Beatles.

08:35.643 --> 08:38.703
Now, they ruined our nation...

08:38.746 --> 08:41.010
drugs, fornicating,

08:41.049 --> 08:44.315
a grown man singing
about his feelings.

08:44.353 --> 08:47.050
It's time we win this war,

08:47.090 --> 08:49.888
expunge this school
of all dope fiends.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.769
Henry: So I've created
a hybrid compound

08:59.805 --> 09:02.036
with a resistance two times that
of regular silicon.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.043
Used as the basis material
for electronics,

09:04.077 --> 09:05.567
it would provide
increased protection

09:05.612 --> 09:07.877
against power surges,
magnetic waves.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.008
This is an electromagnetic
pulse generator.

09:10.051 --> 09:12.612
Actually, could everyone
take a step back?

09:13.789 --> 09:17.317
It's a localized pulse, but it will fry
your laptops, your hard drives.

09:17.360 --> 09:21.195
It'll kill your cell phones
if you're too close.

09:25.303 --> 09:27.498
Tick, tick, tick.

09:30.876 --> 09:32.776
So as you can see,
the motherboard

09:32.812 --> 09:36.010
manufactured by my compound
is the undamaged one.

10:03.616 --> 10:05.174
Shit.

10:06.552 --> 10:08.714
Bitter aftertaste of reality?

10:09.757 --> 10:12.591
You come to see
how the other half lives?

10:16.164 --> 10:19.532
- Boy: Mr. Thompson here?
- He went lookir for you.

10:21.403 --> 10:24.567
Hey, fool, that's my shirt
you got on.

10:24.608 --> 10:26.804
I gave it to Goodwill last year.

10:29.380 --> 10:32.316
Fuckir hobo.

10:33.352 --> 10:34.842
Don't trip, Rubin.

10:34.887 --> 10:37.482
I'm sure he washed
your dad's cum off of it.

10:37.524 --> 10:39.355
What the fuck you just say to me?

10:39.392 --> 10:41.987
I said I'm sure he washed
your dad's cum off of it.

10:42.029 --> 10:45.557
Or did some dry up in your ears?
You should clean them fuckers out.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.124
Try an ear candle, yo.

10:47.169 --> 10:51.698
Rubin?
Why aren't you in your seat?

10:51.741 --> 10:54.539
You know, we could have
a little Abu Ghraib action here,

10:54.577 --> 10:57.103
or we could watch our video.

10:57.147 --> 10:58.910
It's your call.

11:02.754 --> 11:05.121
I'm just gonna go ahead
and sit down.

11:05.157 --> 11:07.352
Good choice.

11:10.530 --> 11:13.465
It's all ready. Just hit play.

11:16.904 --> 11:19.999
Everybody, pay attention.

11:20.042 --> 11:21.600
And no talking.

11:21.643 --> 11:24.135
Narrator on TV: With his parents
out of town for the weekend,

11:24.180 --> 11:28.277
Bob bends to the pressure
of his peers to be somebody

11:28.319 --> 11:30.412
and smokes a joint.

11:30.454 --> 11:33.390
That's street talk
for a marijuana cigarette.

11:33.425 --> 11:36.519
Bob lights up and takes a drag.

11:36.561 --> 11:40.396
What he doesn't realize is that
this seemingly harmless act

11:40.433 --> 11:43.597
will bring the walls
of his reality crashing down.

11:55.985 --> 11:59.080
Narrator: Is this your idea
of getting jiggy with it?

12:06.732 --> 12:10.532
Narrator:
Applesauce 10 times a day.

12:10.569 --> 12:11.696
Man on TV:
How are you feeling?

12:11.738 --> 12:14.332
- Boy: This video eats my balls.
- Boy #2: Word.

12:14.374 --> 12:17.469
Woman on TV: Dr. Gibson,
you're wanted in lobotomy room 7.

12:17.511 --> 12:20.572
Dr. Gibson to lobotomy room 7.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.752
Narrator:
It will also help fund terrorism.

12:27.790 --> 12:31.887
I only really want to blow things up
when I'm high.

12:35.266 --> 12:37.598
Think about it.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.167
Man over radio:
Engage. Smoke 'em.

12:47.781 --> 12:50.444
Henry.
Henry, hey, hey.

12:50.484 --> 12:53.078
Look, I'm sorry.
I drive like shit when I'm high.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.089
You were high at 8:00
in the morning?

12:55.123 --> 12:56.988
Yeah, of course.
I'll help you pay for it, all right?

12:57.025 --> 12:58.516
I'll float you some casheesh.

12:58.561 --> 13:01.894
Well, thanks, man.

13:01.931 --> 13:05.800
I'm sorry about
the whole burner, flunky thing.

13:05.836 --> 13:06.860
Oh, no.
It's all good, you know.

13:06.904 --> 13:09.032
- I get worse from my dad, so...
- Right.

13:09.074 --> 13:11.634
- Yeah.
- How's he doir?

13:12.845 --> 13:13.937
Who's he doir?

13:13.980 --> 13:16.175
He's probably balls deep
in some Jell-O mold as we speak.

13:16.215 --> 13:19.947
Right.
So, um, this is me.

13:19.987 --> 13:21.579
Obviously.

13:23.825 --> 13:25.759
Hey, you remember
how I caught you jerking off

13:25.793 --> 13:27.591
with BENGAY
when you were, like, 12?

13:27.629 --> 13:30.029
- Yeah.
- Aw, yo, that shit must have burned!

13:30.065 --> 13:31.363
- Yeah, that's funny.
- I told everybody, and you ran off

13:31.401 --> 13:33.164
in the woods like some
fuckir cracked-out Hobbit.

13:33.203 --> 13:35.103
- Yeah, no, no. I remember.
- Yo, there were helicopters

13:35.138 --> 13:37.266
- looking for you and shit.
- I remember the helicopters.

13:37.308 --> 13:38.832
I was always wondering what the fuck
they were saying to each other.

13:38.876 --> 13:39.865
- Think about it.
- Really?

13:39.910 --> 13:41.208
"Uh, looking for the kid

13:41.246 --> 13:42.474
who just jerked off. Over."

13:42.514 --> 13:44.209
"Did he just come? Over."

13:44.249 --> 13:47.515
"Negativo, Ghost Rider.
Looking for a case of blue balls. Over."

13:47.553 --> 13:49.953
It was like a scene from "The Fugitive,"
but with a naked kid.

13:49.989 --> 13:52.550
Yeah, that's not really proper
pilot speak, but I guess...

13:52.593 --> 13:54.754
I'm just saying we had
some good times.

13:54.795 --> 13:57.230
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

13:57.265 --> 13:59.256
The hell happened, do you think?

14:01.070 --> 14:02.901
High school.

14:05.075 --> 14:07.202
Yeah, no doubt.

14:09.112 --> 14:11.877
Hey, look, you know, I was driving
by the old 'hood yesterday.

14:13.151 --> 14:15.382
You remember that tree house,
that lockbox we built?

14:17.890 --> 14:19.984
Yeah, sure. Still there?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.757
Wanna go find out?

14:25.800 --> 14:28.827
- Awesome.
- Oh, my God.

14:28.870 --> 14:31.532
What?

14:31.573 --> 14:34.975
Oh, man, all this shit was
so important back in the day, man.

14:35.011 --> 14:36.535
- Henry: Look at these.
- What?

14:36.579 --> 14:38.571
- You look like a fat Billy Ray Cyrus.
- Yo, wait, man.

14:38.615 --> 14:41.379
We should be fuckir high for this.

14:44.255 --> 14:46.348
This is pharmaceutical-grade
Hindu Kush.

14:46.391 --> 14:48.121
What? Do you have
a prescription for weed?

14:48.160 --> 14:52.325
- You don't?
- What? What does that...

14:52.365 --> 14:54.094
You haven't gotten
high before, have you?

14:55.402 --> 14:57.928
You're afraid you're gonna end up
ripping down big loads

14:57.972 --> 15:00.406
in a cave
with the Shoe Bomber?

15:04.913 --> 15:08.645
Getting high, it's... it's like freedom.

15:09.652 --> 15:13.589
Smells, tastes, feelings...

15:13.624 --> 15:18.824
they all become, like,
four-dimensional.

15:18.864 --> 15:20.492
When everyting irie,

15:20.533 --> 15:22.660
everyting go twing twing.

15:24.837 --> 15:27.068
Yeah, let me...

15:27.107 --> 15:30.771
- Fuck it.
- Be somebody.

15:38.220 --> 15:41.315
So it begins.

15:48.566 --> 15:51.161
Can't wait to have an ex-wife, man.

15:51.203 --> 15:53.171
Can't wait for that shit.

15:53.205 --> 15:54.571
Whers the good part kick in?

15:54.607 --> 15:56.802
Like the... like
the fourth-dimensional stuff.

15:56.843 --> 15:58.835
I want the freedom.
Whers the freedom kick in, Breaux?

15:58.879 --> 16:01.143
L... I want the freedom.

16:02.616 --> 16:04.244
Should we even be here right now?

16:04.286 --> 16:06.083
I mean, won't people
get suspicious?

16:06.121 --> 16:08.522
I mean, they'll call the cops,
send helicopters.

16:08.558 --> 16:10.753
I hate fucking helicopters.

16:10.793 --> 16:12.989
No, nobody's gonna
do anything, man.

16:13.030 --> 16:14.054
We're trespassing.

16:14.097 --> 16:15.826
I mean, do you feel this?

16:15.866 --> 16:18.335
'Cause, holy shit, I mean,
I don't even think this is...

16:21.139 --> 16:23.472
Oh, God.

16:25.411 --> 16:26.400
- You okay?
- The freedom hasn't

16:26.445 --> 16:28.073
kicked in yet, asshole!

16:28.114 --> 16:32.415
Hey, what we need to do
right now is just relax.

16:35.323 --> 16:37.383
Fuck, God damn it!

16:37.426 --> 16:39.826
Where are you?!

16:39.861 --> 16:42.353
Where the fuck are you?!

16:42.398 --> 16:45.128
Helicopters everywhere!

16:45.168 --> 16:46.932
Everywhere!

16:46.971 --> 16:49.303
Breaux over radio: Uh, looking
for the kid who just jerked off. Over.

16:49.340 --> 16:51.036
Did he just come? Over.

16:51.076 --> 16:54.603
Negativo, Ghost Rider.
Looking for a case of blue balls. Over.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.989
There were helicopters.
They were hunting me down.

17:15.972 --> 17:18.634
- It's your phone.
- Shit.

17:18.675 --> 17:20.165
What time is it?

17:21.612 --> 17:23.740
Party time.

17:23.781 --> 17:24.907
- Hey.
- Girl: Henry, where are you?

17:24.950 --> 17:25.939
- I'm so sorry.
- We're all here waiting for you.

17:25.983 --> 17:27.679
- Yeah, I'll be there in 20. Fuck!
- What's going on?

17:27.719 --> 17:30.154
I'm borrowing this. I gotta go
to the annual bake sale prep.

17:30.189 --> 17:31.679
- Can you drive?
- You wanna go now?

17:31.724 --> 17:33.659
Yeah. Yeah, I wanna go now.

17:33.694 --> 17:36.561
All right, man.
Well, I want some road-head, then.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.463
I hope you're good
at swallowing, bro.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.161
It's how I like it.

17:46.676 --> 17:49.043
- Ahh.
- We need some more green.

17:49.079 --> 17:53.312
- Boy: She's got ass for days.
- Boner.

17:57.790 --> 18:00.520
Hey, Sharky. What's crackir?
What's crack-a-lackir?

18:00.559 --> 18:03.358
Girl:
Good job. Good, good.

18:03.396 --> 18:05.227
Hey, Sharky. What's crackir?

18:05.265 --> 18:07.427
- What's crack-a-lackir?
- What up, tough guy?

18:07.468 --> 18:08.526
- Hey, Sharky...
- Oh!

18:08.569 --> 18:10.503
I got it.

18:10.538 --> 18:11.733
Fuck!

18:14.309 --> 18:17.074
Oh, I just got my eyebrow
pierced yesterday!

18:24.355 --> 18:26.381
- About freakir time.
- Hey, guys. Sorry.

18:26.424 --> 18:29.484
- You're such a fucking asshole.
- What?

18:29.527 --> 18:31.086
Sharky Ovante
just gave you an opening!

18:31.130 --> 18:34.099
Microscopic, but still.
You blew it.

18:34.133 --> 18:35.829
Yeah.

18:35.869 --> 18:38.633
We grew up next door
to each other.

18:38.672 --> 18:40.800
We used to play together

18:40.842 --> 18:42.469
till she grew breasts.

18:42.510 --> 18:44.035
And that was that.

18:47.182 --> 18:49.708
I ran the numbers.

18:49.753 --> 18:52.017
Assuming we both ace our finals,

18:52.055 --> 18:54.718
it seems to me
you have valedictorian

18:54.759 --> 18:57.250
by 3/100ths of a percentage.

18:57.294 --> 18:59.627
Salutatorian is a pretty big deal,
too, Sebastian, so...

18:59.664 --> 19:01.791
- Still second place, though.
- Well, I suppose

19:01.833 --> 19:04.826
the hinge upon which fate swings
is a capricious one.

19:04.871 --> 19:07.807
- Why are your eyes all red?
- Excuse me, everyone.

19:07.841 --> 19:09.206
Can I please have your attention?

19:09.243 --> 19:12.441
Very impressive, spirit team.
Can you please put her down?

19:12.480 --> 19:13.913
Uh, hey, listen.

19:13.948 --> 19:16.974
We're doing a live
television interview outside,

19:17.018 --> 19:20.216
so if you could all just, you know,
stop throwing each other up in the air

19:20.256 --> 19:21.848
and keep the volume level down,
that'd be great.

19:21.891 --> 19:23.484
- Okay? Thank you.
- Sorry.

19:24.761 --> 19:28.493
And now we'll go live
to Julia Louise Hugo

19:28.533 --> 19:32.470
- at Morgan High School. Julia?
- In five, four, three, two...

19:32.504 --> 19:34.438
I understand that you have
a statement regarding

19:34.473 --> 19:36.669
your student, Charlyne Phuc,
who was recently arrested...

19:36.709 --> 19:40.475
Miss Phuc is no longer
a student of this institution,

19:40.513 --> 19:42.914
and I have requested
that her standing

19:42.950 --> 19:45.578
as three-time
State Spelling Bee Champion

19:45.620 --> 19:48.020
be officially revoked.

19:50.660 --> 19:54.892
Morgan is one of the finest
high schools in this state.

19:54.931 --> 19:58.265
We demand excellence,
not inebriation.

19:58.302 --> 20:01.704
And to reassure our students,

20:01.739 --> 20:04.675
parents, faculty,
and board of regents

20:04.710 --> 20:06.268
of this high standard,

20:06.312 --> 20:11.250
we are conducting
a controlled-substance screening

20:11.284 --> 20:13.479
on campus tomorrow.

20:13.520 --> 20:17.082
All students are required
to participate,

20:17.124 --> 20:20.652
and any student who does not
pass the screening

20:20.696 --> 20:22.994
will be immediately expelled.

20:26.169 --> 20:29.401
Cheese and crackers.
No, no, no, no.

20:29.440 --> 20:33.377
I was trying for genial
and it came off wimpy.

20:33.411 --> 20:36.346
I'd like to be stronger.
Could we try this again?

20:36.381 --> 20:38.441
We're live.

20:38.484 --> 20:41.351
What?

20:41.387 --> 20:43.379
No, no, no, it's great.
Keep shooting. Looks great.

20:43.423 --> 20:45.288
We gotta be clear
by tomorrow morning.

20:45.325 --> 20:47.088
- What drug?
- Shrooms.

20:47.127 --> 20:48.959
- Yeah, we split an eighth.
- How long ago did you take them?

20:48.997 --> 20:51.522
- Hmm. About an hour ago?
- What strain?

20:51.566 --> 20:55.003
Hold on. Hey.
You know what strain we ate?

20:55.037 --> 20:56.767
Dinosaur bones.

20:56.806 --> 20:59.240
- Are your parents home?
- I think.

20:59.276 --> 21:01.643
- Have you been drinking?
- Look at your face.

21:01.679 --> 21:03.579
Did you smoke marijuana
with these mushrooms?

21:03.614 --> 21:05.343
It's all stroked out.

21:05.383 --> 21:06.612
- Sorry.
- What?

21:06.652 --> 21:08.711
So it might be that shit
we ate on prom night.

21:08.754 --> 21:10.221
- I'm looking for Breaux.
- Gordors been pulling

21:10.255 --> 21:11.883
- this Nazi shit forever.
- Did you call the police?

21:11.925 --> 21:14.450
My dad's gonna cancel
the Spice Channel if I get expelled,

21:14.494 --> 21:17.191
beat me up
with my own severed cock.

21:17.231 --> 21:19.028
Let... yo, let me call you right back.

21:19.066 --> 21:20.762
- What?
- You did this to me.

21:20.802 --> 21:22.963
Do you have any idea
how screwed I am right now?

21:25.040 --> 21:26.906
Look, chill, man.
You're causing a scene.

21:26.943 --> 21:28.103
I'm causing a scene?

21:28.144 --> 21:31.911
Causing a scene? What?!

21:36.854 --> 21:38.754
What?

21:38.790 --> 21:41.351
Look, there are other people

21:41.393 --> 21:43.224
trippir balls
pretty hard core right now.

21:43.262 --> 21:44.594
Dude, I'm not like other people.

21:44.631 --> 21:46.121
Okay? I don't trip on balls.

21:46.166 --> 21:49.659
Okay? If I'm busted, I can kiss
my MIT scholarship good-bye.

21:49.704 --> 21:51.968
My entire life
is on the line right now.

21:55.978 --> 21:58.447
Yeah, all right. Hey, you guys,
the pumpkins are trying to kill us.

21:58.481 --> 22:01.746
You gotta go talk to 'em.
Come on, seriously, go.

22:01.784 --> 22:03.810
- What's with them?
- Come on.

22:07.959 --> 22:10.985
This is my cleansing box.
It's for emergency situations.

22:11.029 --> 22:14.431
We've got goldenseal,
but I think they test for that now.

22:14.467 --> 22:17.266
Tea regimen, but it takes
something like two to three days.

22:17.304 --> 22:19.363
There's always urine masks,
but sometimes your piss

22:19.406 --> 22:20.532
can come out a little too clean.

22:20.574 --> 22:23.237
Like it's not even urine anymore.
It's Aquafina.

22:23.277 --> 22:25.245
Okay, so what else
do we have, man? Is that it?

22:25.279 --> 22:26.507
There's the piss pump.

22:26.547 --> 22:28.914
It's classic, but if they frisk you,
they're gonna find it.

22:28.951 --> 22:30.646
- Right.
- The bottom line is anything you use

22:30.686 --> 22:33.520
will buy you a 40% chance
of passing.

22:35.825 --> 22:39.262
That's an F.
That's an F, Breaux.

22:39.296 --> 22:41.458
You know, this is what
they warn you about in that video.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.832
It starts out fun until you start
clawing your eyes out

22:43.869 --> 22:45.234
in a padded cell with al-Qaeda.

22:45.270 --> 22:47.466
One hit could really ruin your life.

22:49.242 --> 22:51.803
I mean, you could always
go around to high schools.

22:51.845 --> 22:55.213
You know, like,
"Don't be like me. I blew it.

22:55.250 --> 22:58.583
Threw my life down
the garbage disposal...

22:58.620 --> 23:01.317
for weed."

23:02.825 --> 23:04.349
Come on!

23:04.393 --> 23:07.295
- Hey, I'm playing, man.
- This is a big deal, Breaux.

23:07.330 --> 23:09.195
I need your... this is a big deal!

23:09.232 --> 23:11.895
Yeah, I know, man.

23:22.882 --> 23:26.410
# Have you ever
watched the sun go down #

23:26.454 --> 23:29.720
# And you're thinking
'bout the world spinnir round? #

23:29.758 --> 23:32.852
# Have you ever
been high as fuck? #

23:36.532 --> 23:40.196
# You're in the bathroom mirror
talking to yourself #

23:40.237 --> 23:43.435
# And your dog's lookir at you
like you need help #

23:43.475 --> 23:47.241
# Have you ever been
high as fuck? #

23:56.958 --> 23:58.425
Oh.

23:58.459 --> 24:00.689
Have you been throwing
cold cuts at my window?

24:00.728 --> 24:02.390
Yo, have you been crying?

24:05.768 --> 24:07.828
Yo, meet me
at the tree house, gangster.

24:07.871 --> 24:10.806
Yo, who the fuck touched my whip?

24:11.842 --> 24:13.002
Got you!

24:13.043 --> 24:14.670
"Sodium aluminum sul..."

24:14.712 --> 24:17.375
There's aluminum in this?
What the fuck?

24:21.587 --> 24:24.215
Look, uh, what if we
walked in tomorrow,

24:24.257 --> 24:27.125
failed the drug test,
and no one even noticed?

24:27.161 --> 24:29.823
What if you could fail and still be
valedictorian and still go to MIT?

24:29.863 --> 24:32.332
- Jesus Christ, you're high again.
- Yeah, I'm always high...

24:32.367 --> 24:34.028
Dude, that's a stoner fantasy, man.

24:34.068 --> 24:35.661
How could I fail the drug test
and no one care?

24:35.704 --> 24:37.763
- If everyone fails.
- Of course.

24:37.807 --> 24:39.867
If we can't pass the test, fine.

24:39.910 --> 24:41.434
Fuck it.
Let's get the whole school high.

24:41.478 --> 24:43.036
Oh, my God.
Please tell me you're kidding.

24:43.079 --> 24:44.775
Tomorrow is the bake sale, right?

24:44.816 --> 24:48.775
We swap in bud brownies,
everyone gets blazed, everyone fails.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.482
They'll have to throw
the test results away.

24:50.522 --> 24:52.217
We won't even use a lot.
All right?

24:52.257 --> 24:55.785
Just enough to muddy the waters.
They'll barely test positive.

24:55.829 --> 24:58.424
Most people won't even notice.
They'll just be a little slow.

24:59.834 --> 25:01.665
- A little slow.
- At times like this,

25:01.702 --> 25:03.568
you need to think like a stoner.

25:10.213 --> 25:13.150
Where are we gonna get
that much weed?

25:27.601 --> 25:30.263
- What?
- What?

25:30.303 --> 25:32.499
What? What?

25:35.476 --> 25:37.001
You're right.

25:39.848 --> 25:42.784
I harvested the crop
a few hours too early.

25:50.261 --> 25:52.696
Ah! I'm so stupid.

25:52.731 --> 25:55.826
Fuckir... so fuckir stupid!

25:58.704 --> 26:00.639
Stupid!

26:04.444 --> 26:07.073
- What?
- What?

26:07.115 --> 26:09.880
What? What?

26:09.919 --> 26:11.819
I'm sorry.

26:11.854 --> 26:14.049
I hate for you to see me this way.

26:15.158 --> 26:17.388
What?

26:19.330 --> 26:22.094
There's this guy... Psycho Ed.

26:22.133 --> 26:24.967
He was like a child prodigy.

26:25.003 --> 26:27.494
Graduated from high school at 15.

26:27.539 --> 26:30.907
Passed the bar exam
before he was old enough to drink.

26:30.944 --> 26:33.743
But then he went
to a foam party in Baja,

26:33.781 --> 26:37.842
smoked a dust blunt
supposedly laced with PCP,

26:37.886 --> 26:40.047
burned something out
in his fuckir brain.

26:40.088 --> 26:41.749
Dropped out the legit world
and became...

26:41.790 --> 26:43.691
Let me guess... a drug dealer.

26:43.726 --> 26:46.490
Yeah, but he's got this shit...
it's better than weed.

26:46.529 --> 26:49.465
It's called kief,
and it's really hard to make

26:49.499 --> 26:52.094
because you need a massive crop
of some crypto-dank herb

26:52.136 --> 26:55.697
on a 32-part-per-million
flowering solution cycle.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.402
Psycho Ed:
Calculated to harvest each bud

26:57.443 --> 27:01.574
when its psychoactive component
is at its absolute apex.

27:01.614 --> 27:05.345
Then I process the buds
to extract the excess THC,

27:05.385 --> 27:07.581
the fruit of an entire harvest.

27:07.621 --> 27:11.718
One misstep
and the crystals are history.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.558
This is kief.

27:14.596 --> 27:17.498
This will seriously

27:17.533 --> 27:20.765
fuck you up.

27:24.441 --> 27:26.808
Hold on, m-man.
You... you want to steal

27:26.845 --> 27:29.211
a psycho drug dealer's
personal kief?

27:29.247 --> 27:31.273
Precisely.

27:32.952 --> 27:35.717
Look, the Daves scored a dime bag
from him this afternoon,

27:35.756 --> 27:37.621
took a look at the place,
told me the whole setup,

27:37.657 --> 27:39.683
- where the keys are.
- Man, this is insane!

27:39.727 --> 27:43.754
- I can't do this!
- You can. It's not.

27:43.798 --> 27:45.426
Look, I know what you're thinking.

27:45.467 --> 27:48.231
- You know, he's got a gun...
- No.

27:48.270 --> 27:50.432
Breaux, I was not thinking that.

27:50.473 --> 27:53.739
Look, at times like this, we can't think
about the things that could go wrong.

27:53.778 --> 27:55.803
We just gotta grab the balls
and go for it.

27:55.846 --> 27:59.078
- The balls. I'm grabbing the balls.
- Exactly.

27:59.117 --> 28:00.709
Whose balls? Stop, Breaux.

28:00.752 --> 28:03.745
- No, I can't do this, man.
- It's easy, okay?

28:03.790 --> 28:05.883
Just hop the back fence,
wait for my signal,

28:05.925 --> 28:07.893
and then bing, bang,
boom, and we dip.

28:07.928 --> 28:09.520
What kind of plan is that?

28:09.563 --> 28:12.191
Breaux. Fuck.

28:16.771 --> 28:18.865
"Beware of my fucking dog."

28:29.954 --> 28:31.546
- Fuck!
- Hey.

28:31.589 --> 28:34.855
What the fuck are you doing out here?
Come on, get in here. Come on.

28:34.893 --> 28:36.555
- Come on! Get in here!
- Okay, okay.

28:36.596 --> 28:39.565
- Have you been crying again?
- Fuck off.

28:40.934 --> 28:42.527
Okay.

28:43.604 --> 28:47.200
It's really dicey in here,
so give me exactly one minute

28:47.242 --> 28:49.403
and then get the key from the door
and head to the back.

28:49.444 --> 28:51.845
He keeps the kief
in a freezer in the grow room.

28:51.881 --> 28:54.315
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, I'm serious.

28:54.350 --> 28:56.945
Fuck. Fuck.

28:56.987 --> 28:58.477
Oh, my God.

28:58.522 --> 29:01.924
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Okay. Okay.

29:01.960 --> 29:04.360
All right.

29:04.395 --> 29:06.956
Okay, okay.

29:16.911 --> 29:20.040
Ain't a strip club, you fuck.

29:50.752 --> 29:53.085
Thanks, brother man.

29:53.122 --> 29:55.386
Everybody says your weed
is the dank shit.

29:58.461 --> 30:01.055
Yeah, well, everyone's right.

30:02.066 --> 30:03.556
Time for you
to get the fuck out.

30:03.601 --> 30:07.060
Well, what about, you know,
weed etiquette?

30:07.105 --> 30:08.470
What?

30:08.507 --> 30:10.975
You know, now I'm supposed
to smoke you out with your own shit.

30:11.009 --> 30:13.171
It's like weed tax.

30:15.582 --> 30:18.575
Do I look like I need you
to get me stoned?

30:20.321 --> 30:22.222
My God,

30:22.257 --> 30:25.158
looks like somebody poured
snake blood in your eyeballs.

30:25.193 --> 30:26.957
Thanks.

30:28.764 --> 30:31.029
Maybe you could
give me some advice?

30:31.068 --> 30:32.558
What?

30:32.603 --> 30:34.902
I bought some seeds online...

30:34.939 --> 30:36.372
- Oh!
- Moron!

30:36.407 --> 30:38.432
Never buy anything online.

30:47.954 --> 30:49.980
This botanist in Portland

30:50.024 --> 30:51.286
knows how to make
the most of what you got.

30:51.325 --> 30:52.314
And where to grow.

30:52.360 --> 30:54.693
Yo, could you print this out
for me, bromeslice?

31:01.404 --> 31:04.897
That's Paranoid.

31:04.942 --> 31:08.379
- Yo, why do they call you Paranoid?
- What? Why you wanna know, man?

31:21.295 --> 31:23.890
Yo, is that, like... is that like
an alarm or something?

31:30.339 --> 31:32.331
Timer.

31:35.645 --> 31:37.637
I'm fully automated.

31:50.063 --> 31:52.362
Oh, shit.

32:07.451 --> 32:09.476
Now piss off.

32:15.627 --> 32:17.754
Shh...

32:19.466 --> 32:21.661
- What the hell is that?
- That's the alarm.

32:21.701 --> 32:22.690
Ah.

32:28.008 --> 32:29.408
He's got the deep beef.

32:29.444 --> 32:31.435
You better not be fuckir with me.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.278
I told you not to fuck with me.

32:42.659 --> 32:44.992
Hey, who the fuck are you, man?

32:45.997 --> 32:48.694
- What, does ganja affect your hearing?
- What?

32:48.734 --> 32:51.032
I've been knocking for,
like, five minutes.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.868
I'll punch you in the head, man.

32:52.906 --> 32:54.874
Who the fuck is this guy, bro?

32:54.908 --> 32:56.933
- You told him your name?
- What?

32:56.978 --> 32:59.538
- Huh?
- He's my... he's my ride, my ride.

32:59.580 --> 33:01.275
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm his ride.

33:01.315 --> 33:03.580
Come on, man,
we gotta get the car back

33:03.619 --> 33:05.280
before my dad gets back.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.915
He's a renegade cop
with a power mullet.

33:07.957 --> 33:09.618
Works the late shift,

33:09.659 --> 33:12.254
likes to shoot things.

33:12.296 --> 33:13.786
- Hey.
- What?

33:16.968 --> 33:18.492
Hmm?

33:20.105 --> 33:22.370
- Yo.
- What?

33:24.444 --> 33:26.140
- What?
- What?

33:26.180 --> 33:28.080
What? What?

33:30.218 --> 33:34.154
Yo, you woke my frog, cunt.

33:35.391 --> 33:37.450
Frogs sleep?

33:38.461 --> 33:39.952
- What?
- What?

33:39.996 --> 33:41.190
- What?
- What?

33:41.231 --> 33:42.664
What?

33:44.201 --> 33:47.467
Adios, muchacho.
Muchísimas gracias.

33:47.505 --> 33:50.669
Hey, next time,
leave Chong at home.

33:51.743 --> 33:54.178
Okay.

33:54.214 --> 33:55.704
- What?
- What?

33:55.748 --> 33:57.943
- What? What?
- Jesus fucking Christ.

33:59.119 --> 34:01.519
Yo! G-G-Go!

34:01.555 --> 34:02.886
Go, go, go, go, go.

34:02.923 --> 34:04.653
- Who sent you?!
- Holy shit!

34:07.963 --> 34:11.226
973 kids at least,
two two-inch brownies apiece.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.395
We're gonna need 42 boxes
of brownie mix, 15 dozen eggs...

34:13.437 --> 34:15.063
- Oh, shit!
- 11 bottles of canola oil, and...

34:15.105 --> 34:17.197
- Hector, clean-up on aisle two.
- Fuck.

34:17.241 --> 34:18.902
- Hey, these are on sale.
- So what, man?

34:18.943 --> 34:21.172
These are the ones that taste good.

34:21.212 --> 34:22.407
Wait, wait, wait.
This is white cake.

34:22.447 --> 34:23.880
It's for me.

34:23.916 --> 34:28.377
# Stained roads #

34:28.420 --> 34:31.185
# Opposite direction #

34:31.224 --> 34:34.092
# Hearts are feeling cold #

34:34.128 --> 34:37.292
# Minds are dejected #

34:37.331 --> 34:40.233
# We want the same things #

34:40.268 --> 34:43.534
# Not just for ourselves #

34:43.572 --> 34:46.543
# Created for me #

34:46.577 --> 34:49.375
# A personal hell... #

35:02.162 --> 35:04.255
# Take this #

35:05.500 --> 35:08.128
# Take this with you #

35:08.169 --> 35:10.661
# The two do not exist #

35:10.706 --> 35:12.799
# In conjunction... #

35:12.841 --> 35:15.470
Dr. Gordon,
the board members are here to see you.

35:15.512 --> 35:19.381
This is the most important day
of your life.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.959
# Hold on to #

35:28.995 --> 35:32.158
# These ebbs and flows #

35:32.198 --> 35:35.657
# Please, please, please,
don't let me... #

35:35.703 --> 35:37.534
Move. Dump them out, man.
We gotta go, quick.

35:37.571 --> 35:39.369
No shit.

35:42.043 --> 35:43.102
Let's go.
Come on, we gotta move.

35:43.145 --> 35:45.511
- Shut up.
- Quicker, quicker, quicker. Let's go.

35:45.548 --> 35:47.072
- Okay.
- Come on.

35:47.116 --> 35:50.280
- # Don't cut me, cut me out #
- There's a car here.

35:50.320 --> 35:53.449
A shepherd must be held
accountable for his sheep.

35:53.491 --> 35:55.652
That is why I welcome
the board's review

35:55.693 --> 35:59.494
of our new zero-tolerance policy
on controlled substances.

35:59.531 --> 36:01.830
Today, Morgan High
is conducting

36:01.868 --> 36:05.065
its first ever student screening.

36:05.105 --> 36:08.098
No drug tests! No drug tests!

36:13.682 --> 36:15.172
Greetings, fellow Patriots.

36:15.217 --> 36:17.812
This is your assistant dean,
Brandon.

36:17.854 --> 36:20.049
Just a reminder that today

36:20.089 --> 36:23.890
is the annual end-of-the-year
PTA bake sale

36:23.927 --> 36:25.793
with benefits going toward

36:25.830 --> 36:30.062
the band and track team
to get new uniforms.

36:30.101 --> 36:34.061
So don't count calories
or carbs today.

36:34.106 --> 36:35.870
You know I'm not.

36:35.909 --> 36:39.310
# Necessity... #

36:40.581 --> 36:42.947
Today is the dawning
of a new era here at Morgan.

36:44.118 --> 36:47.748
And I, Dr. Leslie Gordon,

36:47.790 --> 36:49.884
give you my personal assurance

36:49.926 --> 36:51.621
that you will never, ever

36:51.661 --> 36:53.891
hear of another student
from Morgan High

36:53.931 --> 36:57.560
being under the influence
of any illicit drug

36:58.569 --> 37:00.561
ever again.

37:07.046 --> 37:08.139
Punch?

37:09.149 --> 37:12.243
These are fuckir good.

37:19.428 --> 37:21.487
All right, kids, we're only gonna
get a few more chances

37:21.530 --> 37:24.466
to do this this year,
so here we go.

37:24.501 --> 37:27.699
10, nine, eight...

37:27.739 --> 37:29.570
I really don't like doing this...

37:29.607 --> 37:31.768
seven, six...

37:31.810 --> 37:33.539
this is not a test...

37:33.579 --> 37:35.979
five, four...

37:36.014 --> 37:39.507
get to class.

37:44.725 --> 37:46.819
But... but was it...

37:48.663 --> 37:50.928
Chicken quesadilla?

37:55.839 --> 37:57.636
What?

38:12.492 --> 38:14.153
Shit.

38:14.194 --> 38:16.288
What's the matter, man?

38:18.332 --> 38:20.494
I could fix you another one.

38:22.938 --> 38:24.873
Yo, Edwin, you all right, man?

38:24.908 --> 38:26.842
Chad, please take the roll sheet

38:26.876 --> 38:29.004
to the administration office.

38:29.046 --> 38:31.037
- Chad!
- What?

38:31.081 --> 38:32.981
What? What?

38:33.017 --> 38:35.782
The roll sheet to the office.

38:35.821 --> 38:38.347
Oh, shit.

38:44.965 --> 38:47.559
Just go.

38:47.601 --> 38:50.435
Dana, Jeffrey, please read
today's announcements.

38:56.946 --> 38:58.437
Wha... what?

38:58.481 --> 39:01.678
I got webbed hands.
L... I've never noticed that.

39:21.643 --> 39:23.304
What?

39:23.345 --> 39:25.746
Name?

39:26.749 --> 39:28.239
Name!

39:31.288 --> 39:33.882
Uh...

39:33.924 --> 39:36.689
I have a nickname.

39:36.728 --> 39:40.859
Finger.
Oh, and, um, Acorn Dick.

39:40.900 --> 39:43.528
It's un... it's unfortunate.

39:43.569 --> 39:45.629
So which one do you want first?

39:46.806 --> 39:49.867
Hands up.
Got any sharp objects? Needles?

39:49.911 --> 39:52.345
Porta-Potty to your left.
Here is the plastic...

39:52.380 --> 39:54.440
I like your... your tats.

39:54.483 --> 39:58.078
You're not on the Suicide Girls
website, are you?

39:58.120 --> 40:01.318
Does this nurse look
totally insectoid to you?

40:01.357 --> 40:03.758
Thought I saw you on there.

40:03.794 --> 40:05.261
I'll text you.

40:05.296 --> 40:08.323
What the fuck, man?
People are losing their shit right now.

40:08.366 --> 40:10.357
According to... according to
"Stoner of the Year,"

40:10.402 --> 40:13.395
bud brownies are the most dangerous
and terrifying inebriate.

40:13.439 --> 40:15.407
The thing about them is you keep
getting higher and higher.

40:15.441 --> 40:18.411
It does not stop.
How much kief did you use, man?

40:18.445 --> 40:22.883
Uh, you know, a smidge, a shake,
a Martha Stewart steeze.

40:24.852 --> 40:27.822
Okay, I spilled it, all right?
A shit-load.

40:27.856 --> 40:28.880
- All right...
- Sebastian: Did you hear?

40:28.924 --> 40:31.620
Someone locked the PTA moms
in the weight room.

40:32.696 --> 40:35.688
Looks like Dean Gordon installed
that new surveillance system

40:35.732 --> 40:37.564
just in time.

40:39.370 --> 40:42.602
Oh, right, you wouldn't know.

40:42.641 --> 40:44.233
I mean, I only know
because, of course,

40:44.276 --> 40:47.371
you know, I tutor his son Mark
and I overheard it.

40:47.413 --> 40:50.576
Cameras everywhere.

40:50.616 --> 40:54.075
It's an Orwellian wet dream.

41:01.998 --> 41:03.488
- Henry, slow down.
- We're going to jail.

41:03.532 --> 41:05.160
- Gordon caught us on camera.
- We don't know that.

41:05.202 --> 41:07.670
- And even if he did, we can fix this.
- Yeah? How?

41:07.704 --> 41:09.604
I don't know, the footage...
we don't even know if they watched it.

41:09.639 --> 41:11.904
- We'll just fuckir find it.
- Dr. Gordors son.

41:11.943 --> 41:13.570
Let's go have a chat
with that veining dildo.

41:13.611 --> 41:15.079
Wait, no, no, no. I can't.
I'm late for my first final.

41:15.114 --> 41:16.206
Forget your final.
This is important.

41:16.248 --> 41:18.216
You don't get it, man. If I screw up
my final, I'm just as fucked.

41:18.250 --> 41:19.741
Okay, I'll find that pimply dipshit
and then I'll text you.

41:19.786 --> 41:21.488
All right.
Thanks, man.

41:22.889 --> 41:24.551
I'ma tell you what hurts...

41:24.592 --> 41:26.253
having a daddy with glaucoma.

41:26.293 --> 41:28.261
Old man couldn't see shit.

41:28.295 --> 41:31.493
So I tried to score him, you know,
an ounce of Chocolate Thai...

41:35.638 --> 41:37.799
Uh...

41:55.896 --> 41:59.833
This is cra... this is crazy.

41:59.867 --> 42:03.133
We are proud to have awarded
an academic scholarship

42:03.172 --> 42:07.007
to one of only three living
human beings to have beaten

42:07.043 --> 42:10.774
the Carnegie Mellon Red One
Supercomputer at chess:

42:10.814 --> 42:12.305
Edwin Hunter.

42:12.349 --> 42:16.878
Elo rated as the third best
chess player on the planet Earth.

42:19.124 --> 42:22.925
It looks like Edwin
will have the first move

42:22.962 --> 42:24.953
because he's white.

42:26.533 --> 42:31.562
I mean... the white pieces.

42:31.606 --> 42:34.131
White always goes first.

42:34.175 --> 42:36.474
I mean, that is...

42:36.512 --> 42:39.481
the person with the white...
oh, look.

42:40.650 --> 42:44.211
This pawn looks like
my Uncle Neville's

42:44.254 --> 42:46.450
elongated nipple.

42:48.559 --> 42:52.326
- Rest in peace, you slut.
- Music! Ahem.

42:52.364 --> 42:54.799
Would you all like to listen
to some music?

43:04.346 --> 43:05.540
Dude, the white judge...

43:05.580 --> 43:09.312
the white judge knocked me
to the joint for 25 to life

43:09.352 --> 43:12.014
for some fuckir sinsemilla, man.

43:12.054 --> 43:14.114
We already heard
that one, too, asshole.

43:14.158 --> 43:15.819
Well, the world need to hear it,

43:15.859 --> 43:19.125
and they will in my book,

43:19.164 --> 43:21.826
"Alcatrizaz."

43:21.866 --> 43:23.391
Shit.

43:32.813 --> 43:35.281
That sounded like a wet fart.

43:35.316 --> 43:39.219
Well, you'd know, incontinent slank.

43:39.254 --> 43:41.883
What the hell is going on
around this place?

43:41.925 --> 43:43.859
Is someone trying
to sabotage me?

43:43.893 --> 43:48.228
- Are you trying to bring me down?
- Jesus, no. I've been paging you.

43:48.265 --> 43:52.100
No drug tests! No drug tests!

43:52.137 --> 43:54.435
Hmm.
Batteries must have died.

43:54.472 --> 43:57.408
Sir, we've had
an unusual number

43:57.443 --> 44:01.904
of students and faculty
complaining of...

44:01.949 --> 44:06.114
confusion and... and dizziness.

44:06.154 --> 44:08.622
I haven't been feeling
so sweet myself,

44:08.656 --> 44:11.524
so I was thinking that maybe
it was a gas leak,

44:11.560 --> 44:13.425
so I called in

44:13.462 --> 44:17.695
an emergency...
work... thingy.

44:17.734 --> 44:21.034
I want answers. Brainstorm this thing.

44:21.072 --> 44:23.097
There he is!

44:23.140 --> 44:25.701
What about our childrers
right to privacy?

44:25.744 --> 44:29.203
- No unlawful search and seizure.
- Yeah, fuck you!

44:29.249 --> 44:32.616
- Fuck you!
- Man: Who do you think you are?!

44:32.652 --> 44:35.713
Oh, fuck, man.

44:38.560 --> 44:41.290
Ah, shit.

44:41.329 --> 44:43.161
- Hey.
- What?

44:43.199 --> 44:45.167
You made me drop
my ice cream.

44:45.201 --> 44:47.898
Why the fuck would you be eating it
like that on a day like today?

44:47.938 --> 44:51.840
Because it tastes ambrosian
when I'm buttstonked,

44:51.875 --> 44:54.902
but don't tell the cops that
when they arrive.

44:54.946 --> 44:57.575
I'm on probation for a misdemeanor
possession charge.

44:57.616 --> 44:59.550
- What?
- Shit.

44:59.585 --> 45:02.521
You didn't think about gettir
no fuckir Slurpee, kid?

45:02.555 --> 45:03.920
You like Slurpees, don't you?

45:03.957 --> 45:06.255
- Who me?
- No, the...

45:09.330 --> 45:11.925
Man:
Oh, man.

45:14.002 --> 45:15.970
- Fuck.
- What?

45:16.004 --> 45:18.166
- What?
- Shit.

45:18.207 --> 45:21.336
- Fuck.
- What?

45:21.378 --> 45:24.176
- Fuck.
- Paranoid and Charlyne: What?

45:24.214 --> 45:26.342
- What?
- Fuck.

45:26.384 --> 45:28.181
What?!

45:32.124 --> 45:34.149
Get the fuck out of here.

45:46.742 --> 45:50.179
- I'm melting!
- Martin.

45:50.213 --> 45:53.410
How many brownies did you eat?

45:57.054 --> 46:00.650
- 14?
- Jesus H. Christ.

46:02.928 --> 46:04.726
Martin, look at me.

46:04.764 --> 46:07.426
You are really stoned right now, man.

46:07.467 --> 46:10.028
You look like you're about
to summit Mt. Zion.

46:10.070 --> 46:11.799
We'll tell your daddy.

46:11.839 --> 46:15.469
You could get expelled, little man.

46:15.510 --> 46:18.309
Where do they record
the security footage?

46:18.347 --> 46:20.941
Huh? Huh?

46:20.983 --> 46:22.781
- Come on, man.
- Give the fuckir milk.

46:22.819 --> 46:24.719
Tell us, Martin,
and you get the milk.

46:24.755 --> 46:26.723
In the library,
in... in the back room.

46:26.757 --> 46:29.591
- My daddy has the keys.
- Okay, okay, okay.

46:29.627 --> 46:31.788
If you speak a word of this
to anyone and I'll make sure

46:31.829 --> 46:33.559
what you're feeling right now
is permanent.

46:33.599 --> 46:36.033
I'm the pope of dope.
I can make that happen.

46:36.068 --> 46:38.435
Maybe I just dosed the milk
you just downed

46:38.471 --> 46:41.167
with high-grade liquid acid.

46:41.207 --> 46:43.335
Keep your mouth shut, homes.

46:45.513 --> 46:47.277
Well, did you?!

46:53.089 --> 46:55.614
Die, Leonard! Die!

46:55.658 --> 46:57.991
I'm gonna murder you!

46:58.028 --> 46:59.859
Perhaps you'd like some lunch?

46:59.897 --> 47:01.490
This is great, man.

47:01.533 --> 47:02.966
How are we supposed to get
the keys from him?

47:03.001 --> 47:04.866
Are you joking?
I wanna see what it looks like

47:04.903 --> 47:06.064
when someone is murdered.

47:06.105 --> 47:07.333
Ah!

47:07.373 --> 47:09.068
What if we could unlock
the surveillance room

47:09.108 --> 47:10.508
without even going near
Dr. Gordon?

47:10.544 --> 47:12.671
How, man? How?

47:23.492 --> 47:28.123
# Watch out,
here we go again #

47:28.164 --> 47:33.193
# Just say my name
and I will bend #

47:33.237 --> 47:36.674
# I'll kill you with my words #

47:36.708 --> 47:39.735
# And I'll kill you with mine... #

47:44.485 --> 47:45.975
Gordors a psycho.

47:46.019 --> 47:47.509
He canceled his wife's
gym membership

47:47.554 --> 47:49.182
because he thought
she was fucking her trainer,

47:49.224 --> 47:51.749
but gave her a spare set of keys
so she could work out here.

47:51.793 --> 47:54.285
Must keep in shape
with all the sport fucking she does.

47:54.330 --> 47:56.821
- Wait, what?
- She's a cougar, dipshit.

47:56.866 --> 47:58.459
A fucking coug.

47:58.502 --> 48:00.800
What school have you been going to?
Everybody's fucked her, man.

48:00.837 --> 48:02.738
- I-I haven't.
- Well, everyone but you.

48:02.773 --> 48:04.673
- You haven't.
- Everyone but us.

48:04.709 --> 48:06.472
- The Daves?
- Shut the fuck up, all right!

48:06.511 --> 48:08.844
It's a breeze.
I go out there, I distract her...

48:08.881 --> 48:09.870
Wait, let me guess,
let me guess.

48:09.915 --> 48:12.942
While... while I commit another felony,
sneak into the mers locker room,

48:12.986 --> 48:14.681
and then bing, bang,
boom, and we dip.

48:14.721 --> 48:15.710
- Exactly.
- Right.

48:15.755 --> 48:18.156
You grab the keys from her purse
while we're having sex.

48:18.192 --> 48:19.682
What?

48:19.727 --> 48:24.131
# Just say my name
and I will bend #

48:24.165 --> 48:26.157
# With mine. #

48:33.277 --> 48:35.712
Mind if I turn up the heat?

48:36.748 --> 48:40.776
Wha... what do you...
what do you think you're doing?

48:40.819 --> 48:42.946
Having a hell of a day.

48:42.988 --> 48:44.854
Thought I'd chill
the fuck out in the pool.

48:44.891 --> 48:46.688
You know, get out of here.

48:46.726 --> 48:48.216
Get out of here
before you get yourself

48:48.261 --> 48:50.628
into some serious trouble,
young man. Okay?

48:53.334 --> 48:55.769
I won't tell if you won't.

49:00.076 --> 49:03.443
Look, how the hell
did you get in here?

49:03.479 --> 49:06.745
- Hmm?
- I'm... I'm into you.

49:06.784 --> 49:08.412
Seriously, I'm down.

49:10.388 --> 49:11.616
I'm calling the police.

49:11.656 --> 49:13.716
You shut your blood clat, Mommy.

49:13.759 --> 49:15.659
What do you tink
I came in here for?

49:15.695 --> 49:17.253
What did you just say?

49:17.296 --> 49:19.322
Let me peep them Babylons,
you ras-clat.

49:19.366 --> 49:20.697
All right, listen, you little bastard.

49:20.734 --> 49:23.295
I'm gonna have you arrested so fast
that your head will spin.

49:23.338 --> 49:26.774
- Do you understand me?
- I ain't scared of no 5-0.

49:27.776 --> 49:29.437
- Why are you talking like that?
- What?

49:31.347 --> 49:33.339
Oh, yeah.

49:44.296 --> 49:46.424
- What is that?
- What?

49:46.466 --> 49:48.934
Oh, I hear it.

49:48.968 --> 49:52.370
How weird.
Is someone here?

49:52.406 --> 49:54.067
Hello?

49:54.108 --> 49:56.304
Let's stop this.

49:56.344 --> 49:58.642
Amanda?

49:58.680 --> 50:00.170
Hello?

50:00.215 --> 50:02.207
"Jizz coming out
of my Johnson..."

50:02.251 --> 50:04.811
- That's just creepy.
- I definitely hear somebody.

50:06.323 --> 50:09.224
"Hog in your mud..."

50:09.259 --> 50:11.455
Administration office?

50:11.496 --> 50:13.760
- Pass the towel.
- No.

50:21.274 --> 50:24.403
- Huh, that was weird.
- Yeah.

50:24.445 --> 50:26.037
I can drive tonight if you want.

50:26.080 --> 50:27.308
Fuck, yeah!

50:27.348 --> 50:29.579
You were like the star of your own
ninja porno back there...

50:29.618 --> 50:31.483
"Enter the Cougar."

50:31.520 --> 50:35.355
- Watch this, biatch.
- There's the old sense of humor.

50:35.391 --> 50:37.882
He's holding out on us, man.
I know it.

50:42.800 --> 50:44.462
Fucking notebook?

50:45.904 --> 50:47.531
Español.

50:50.042 --> 50:52.067
What the hell is this shit?

51:02.090 --> 51:05.527
Need to freshen up a bit.

51:14.305 --> 51:15.795
This is gonna get ugly.

51:15.840 --> 51:19.174
A case can be made that things
have already gotten pretty ugly, Edward.

51:20.579 --> 51:23.378
You read my mind, man.

51:23.416 --> 51:25.611
How you be doing
that fuckir shit?

51:27.254 --> 51:29.745
You guys better wait here.

51:29.790 --> 51:32.351
- Gladly.
- Fuckir weirdos.

51:32.393 --> 51:34.384
Paranoid: Don't... don't...
don't make no eye contact.

51:34.429 --> 51:36.955
They've got laser blades.
They can reset your brain.

51:37.967 --> 51:39.457
Thanks for the warning.

51:40.537 --> 51:42.471
Flies in the web.
Yeah, we got 'em. Reel 'em.

51:51.216 --> 51:52.979
Okay, where's my piss pump?

51:53.018 --> 51:55.783
We have to rig that shit up
before we get chi-chi faced.

51:55.822 --> 51:57.187
Here.

52:00.261 --> 52:02.957
This one has a black
prosthetic dick, asshole.

52:02.997 --> 52:07.196
- What if they take a look, man?
- Maybe you just have a tan cock.

52:10.306 --> 52:11.933
Give me your cock.

52:11.974 --> 52:14.034
Looks Latino.

52:14.077 --> 52:15.874
Fine, take that cock.

52:15.913 --> 52:19.680
I'll wear your
black shriveled dick.

52:23.489 --> 52:24.979
Wait.

52:25.024 --> 52:29.121
Let's make sure there are
no motherfuckers in here listening.

53:13.415 --> 53:16.249
I'm a surveillance room key.
What do I look like?

53:16.286 --> 53:19.255
Move Neville's nipple
or suck on it already, biatch.

53:21.158 --> 53:23.626
- Try them again.
- I did, man, all of them. Twice.

53:23.661 --> 53:26.062
This must be the door.
So where's the fuckir key?

53:26.098 --> 53:27.827
What's poppir off, gentlemen?

53:27.866 --> 53:31.268
- Care for a bite, Henry?
- Uh, no, thanks.

53:31.304 --> 53:33.670
- I'm, uh, fasting.
- Oh, well, that's a shame.

53:33.706 --> 53:35.197
I've heard they're delicious.

53:35.242 --> 53:38.940
Too bad chocolate reminds me
of human feces.

53:38.980 --> 53:41.448
- Weird day, isn't it?
- It's high school.

53:41.483 --> 53:45.614
Everyday is weird.
See you, Sebastian.

53:45.655 --> 53:48.853
I found a dumpster full of brownies.

53:53.064 --> 53:55.362
I ask you,

53:55.400 --> 53:57.801
why would someone
wanna throw away

53:57.836 --> 54:00.202
so many perfectly good brownies?

54:02.007 --> 54:04.704
You should have a brownie.

54:04.744 --> 54:08.408
- Pure THC kills nausea.
- Henry: Fuck off, Doctor.

54:08.449 --> 54:12.716
- # I am the walrus! #
- Boy: Coo coo ca choo.

54:14.289 --> 54:16.223
We should get this whole school
high more often.

54:17.260 --> 54:19.228
- More often?
- Yeah, on a scale

54:19.262 --> 54:22.096
between a prostate exam
and a reggae festival,

54:22.132 --> 54:24.430
it's somewhere around giving
your mother multiple orgasms.

54:24.468 --> 54:25.959
What kind of scale is that?

54:26.004 --> 54:28.837
You know, you find this
really fuckir funny, don't you?

54:28.873 --> 54:31.274
This could really tarnish
your .65 GPA.

54:31.310 --> 54:34.438
I mean, your bright future is totally
hanging in the balance, Breaux.

54:37.284 --> 54:40.311
Yeah, I... I do have plans,
for your information.

54:40.355 --> 54:43.347
The Daves and I,
we wanna travel,

54:43.391 --> 54:46.850
learn to play the sitar, and then
eventually settle somewhere else.

54:46.895 --> 54:48.886
Maybe Nicaragua.

54:48.931 --> 54:52.095
You know, and I... I know buying land
out there can be pretty sketchy

54:52.135 --> 54:53.625
because the government
can pretty much jack it

54:53.670 --> 54:56.435
whenever they want,
but fuck it, right?

54:56.474 --> 54:58.374
Wow, man.

54:58.409 --> 55:00.605
It's a hell of a plan, really.

55:00.645 --> 55:02.135
Oh, shit.

55:02.180 --> 55:04.012
- What?
- Hi.

55:05.685 --> 55:06.811
Where is it?

55:06.853 --> 55:10.381
It's, uh... it's gone.
It's gone, man.

55:10.424 --> 55:12.585
What?

55:12.626 --> 55:14.993
That's impossible.

55:15.030 --> 55:16.554
Where is it?

55:18.367 --> 55:23.101
There was enough kief to get
this whole fucking school high.

55:58.549 --> 56:02.042
You sick, twisted fucks.

56:04.055 --> 56:06.524
You did get the whole school high.

56:08.260 --> 56:12.197
Now... now, that's just the most
mental thing I've ever seen.

56:18.739 --> 56:20.765
But you pinched
the wrong mars load.

56:20.809 --> 56:23.175
Okay, okay, we'll pay you back.
We'll pay it back, okay?

56:23.212 --> 56:26.478
- You don't have enough.
- There's cameras, there's cameras.

56:26.516 --> 56:28.814
There's cameras?!

56:28.852 --> 56:30.753
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- There's cameras?

56:30.788 --> 56:35.718
Where's the camera?
Where's the camera?

56:35.760 --> 56:36.852
Huh? Huh?
Where's the camera?

56:36.895 --> 56:38.796
Where's the camera?
Is that a camera?

56:38.831 --> 56:40.162
- No, no. No, no, no. Okay.
- Oh, shit.

56:40.199 --> 56:41.632
You think I give a fuck
about cameras?

56:41.667 --> 56:44.068
The bake sale...
they're raising money.

56:44.104 --> 56:45.594
- How much?
- I don't know! I don't know!

56:45.639 --> 56:47.903
I don't know.
We'll pay it back, we'll pay it back.

56:47.941 --> 56:49.773
- We'll find it.
- I want it in an hour.

56:49.811 --> 56:51.108
- Two hours.
- What the fuck?

56:51.146 --> 56:52.842
Two hours.
Please, please.

56:52.882 --> 56:54.645
That'll get you
till the end of the day.

56:55.885 --> 56:59.219
And then we're gonna
have a very

56:59.256 --> 57:02.658
serious talk.

57:02.693 --> 57:06.129
- Huh?
- Okay, okay, okay.

57:06.164 --> 57:09.623
Does this happen to you a lot?

57:09.668 --> 57:12.002
What the fuck are we gonna do
about that freak Sebastian

57:12.038 --> 57:13.528
and Dr. Gordors
surveillance footage?

57:13.573 --> 57:14.835
Fuck that. Let's worry about

57:14.874 --> 57:16.604
staying out of the morgue first,
then jail.

57:16.644 --> 57:18.305
- What?
- We find the bake sale cash box

57:18.345 --> 57:19.505
and we pay off Psycho Ed.

57:19.547 --> 57:20.536
And we have a whole two hours.

57:20.581 --> 57:21.810
- Right.
- "Thank you, Breaux."

57:21.850 --> 57:24.478
Right, which gives us
till about 10 after 12.

57:24.519 --> 57:26.818
Fuck! No, I can't.
I've got my computer skills final.

57:26.856 --> 57:29.051
All right, I'll fuckir deal.
Go be a superstar.

57:29.091 --> 57:30.821
There's tape on the keys.

57:30.861 --> 57:33.193
- How am I supposed to type?
- Dana: It's a final, you 'tard.

57:33.230 --> 57:35.323
You're not supposed
to see the keys.

57:37.068 --> 57:39.400
I think.

57:39.437 --> 57:41.099
Miss Unger?

57:42.141 --> 57:43.631
Hello?

57:44.945 --> 57:49.507
Hello. I was just drawing
a picture of my cat Bryan.

57:49.549 --> 57:52.075
I named him after Bryan Adams.

57:52.119 --> 57:54.953
All right, let's take a test.

57:56.291 --> 58:01.423
Boy, he's a very sexy singer.

58:01.464 --> 58:05.128
I used to pretend
that my glass dildo

58:05.169 --> 58:09.971
was, in fact, Mr. Adams' erect

58:10.008 --> 58:14.378
glass-encased member...

58:14.413 --> 58:17.644
Because the forest wizard
had turned him to glass, of course.

58:17.683 --> 58:22.348
So only the moistened walls
of the village witch

58:22.389 --> 58:24.449
could return him to human form.

58:32.469 --> 58:35.097
Was that out loud
or did I just think that?

58:39.577 --> 58:41.511
Isn't this the administration office?

58:41.545 --> 58:44.777
No, it isn't.
It is my classroom.

58:45.851 --> 58:48.480
- I think.
- Are you fucking with me?

58:48.521 --> 58:52.549
Excuse me, is that the attendance list
I gave you this morning?

59:08.512 --> 59:11.311
You're positive Sharky
left the cash box in Gordors office?

59:11.349 --> 59:14.512
- Yeah. Look, the money's in there.
- Cool, cool.

59:14.552 --> 59:16.487
- So where's Sharky now?
- No, no, come on!

59:16.522 --> 59:19.924
Horny man, I need your magical,
geek power brain to be focused for this.

59:19.959 --> 59:21.620
No, man. Fuck that.

59:21.661 --> 59:23.288
I got the keys out of the womers
locker room, man.

59:23.330 --> 59:24.821
- This one's yours.
- That was simple.

59:24.865 --> 59:27.959
I had to tame a cougar.
This is the administration office.

59:28.002 --> 59:29.368
Yeah, you're the career criminal, man.

59:29.404 --> 59:31.338
- This should be, like, easy for you.
- Right. You're right.

59:31.373 --> 59:34.070
L... I'm, you know, suspicious.

59:34.110 --> 59:36.874
And you, you're the straight-arrow,
tight-ass geek.

59:36.913 --> 59:38.141
Oh, so maybe I should
smoke weed all day

59:38.181 --> 59:39.843
and I wouldn't have to do
any hard work.

59:39.883 --> 59:41.214
Yeah, well, maybe I should
get some straight As

59:41.251 --> 59:43.082
and hang out with some flip-flop
floobie-doos who eat glue.

59:43.120 --> 59:45.180
Yeah, there's a minimum
IQ requirement to be in the auto club.

59:45.223 --> 59:49.251
Is there a minimum vagina
requirement to be in the IQ club?

59:49.295 --> 59:51.627
No.

59:56.403 --> 59:58.770
All right, we're gonna
have to clear the office.

59:58.806 --> 01:00:01.604
Oh, fuck!

01:00:01.642 --> 01:00:04.840
This is intense.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.438
Shit.

01:00:06.482 --> 01:00:08.144
- There you are.
- Mom?

01:00:08.184 --> 01:00:11.347
Oh, my God.
Dude, how blazed are you two?

01:00:11.388 --> 01:00:14.381
You tried to hold out
on us, you fuck.

01:00:15.393 --> 01:00:17.828
Oh, shit.

01:00:20.132 --> 01:00:23.125
- Just tell my mom I love her, man.
- You tell her yourself.

01:00:23.169 --> 01:00:25.763
- No, man.
- Pull it together.

01:00:25.805 --> 01:00:28.639
Little Dave, you know that stunt
you've been yammering about?

01:00:28.675 --> 01:00:30.906
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, now would be perfect.

01:00:30.945 --> 01:00:32.412
Why now?

01:00:34.582 --> 01:00:38.144
We dosed the whole school.
We need a distraction.

01:00:39.755 --> 01:00:41.917
- That sounded weird.
- What?

01:00:41.958 --> 01:00:43.858
What?

01:00:43.894 --> 01:00:46.261
Oh!

01:00:56.643 --> 01:00:59.077
May I have your attention, please?

01:00:59.112 --> 01:01:02.344
Witness the death-defying stunt

01:01:02.383 --> 01:01:04.284
never before attempted.

01:01:04.319 --> 01:01:08.984
Little Dave Klein is gonna jump off
the library balcony

01:01:09.025 --> 01:01:13.861
on his motherfuckir skateboard!

01:01:13.897 --> 01:01:15.421
Yeah!

01:01:18.336 --> 01:01:19.667
The balcony.

01:01:22.373 --> 01:01:24.808
- Go for it, Dave.
- It's suicide!

01:01:24.844 --> 01:01:26.334
- Let's check it out!
- Let's roll this shit.

01:01:33.421 --> 01:01:36.185
Whoo!

01:01:36.224 --> 01:01:37.692
Yeah!

01:01:37.726 --> 01:01:39.785
Whoa! Oh!

01:01:39.828 --> 01:01:42.354
Whoa! Yes!

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.735
That was some
"Faces of Death" shit, homes.

01:01:47.771 --> 01:01:50.899
- I can feel skin flapping.
- What?

01:01:50.941 --> 01:01:53.570
Seriously, I think
I've ripped my sack, man.

01:01:55.313 --> 01:01:57.248
I should have tenured at Stanford.

01:02:20.945 --> 01:02:22.708
Tameka?

01:02:23.781 --> 01:02:26.842
- Tameka!
- I'm sorry. There was an incident.

01:02:26.885 --> 01:02:28.819
Here's your coffee.

01:02:31.858 --> 01:02:34.623
- I'm so sorry?
- Thank you.

01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:37.261
Is there anything else, sir?

01:02:37.298 --> 01:02:39.426
- The gas man is waiting...
- No, I'm finished.

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:44.904
Actually, there is

01:02:44.941 --> 01:02:50.141
one small thing I'd like you
to take care of, Tameka.

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.114
Oh, yes.

01:02:52.149 --> 01:02:54.482
Yes, there is.

01:03:00.259 --> 01:03:02.318
- The cops are coming.
- What?

01:03:02.361 --> 01:03:03.886
- They're on their way.
- The police?

01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:05.124
- Yes!
- No, t-tell them

01:03:05.165 --> 01:03:06.996
- that's everything's under control.
- That's not gonna work.

01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:09.798
Oh, God damn it!
I'll be right there.

01:03:16.946 --> 01:03:19.380
- Yeah!
- Live the moment! Live it!

01:03:22.386 --> 01:03:24.616
Fuck.

01:03:24.655 --> 01:03:27.318
I lost count.
Fuckir singles.

01:03:29.861 --> 01:03:34.026
$2,403.

01:03:34.066 --> 01:03:36.558
- That's a start.
- Wait, a start?

01:03:36.603 --> 01:03:39.003
- You said if we got you the money...
- I said that it will buy you

01:03:39.039 --> 01:03:40.803
till the end of the day.

01:03:42.176 --> 01:03:44.838
This shit ain't even remotely close
to the street value.

01:03:44.879 --> 01:03:46.871
How much?

01:03:51.588 --> 01:03:53.988
- 50.
- Thousand?

01:03:54.024 --> 01:03:58.462
No, cents, stupid.
50 fucking thousand.

01:03:58.496 --> 01:03:59.987
US.

01:04:01.099 --> 01:04:04.797
Let's call it 49,
since I like you guys, huh?

01:04:04.837 --> 01:04:08.000
You're both fuckir nuts. Huh?

01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:10.943
- I'll be waiting in the parking lot.
- So you're just leaving, then?

01:04:10.978 --> 01:04:12.468
You don't see
what's going on here?

01:04:12.513 --> 01:04:13.913
You don't see
what we're up against?

01:04:13.948 --> 01:04:16.212
We could use a psychoism fiend
with a lot of green

01:04:16.251 --> 01:04:17.741
and you're turning your back on us.

01:04:17.786 --> 01:04:21.018
Go take care of yourself, Ed.

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:22.354
Guess it's what you're best at.

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:25.156
I'm not fucking around!

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:27.425
The money or you're
both marked, man.

01:04:31.002 --> 01:04:32.937
Weed legends or not.

01:04:39.579 --> 01:04:41.740
We're live at the prestigious
Morgan High School

01:04:41.781 --> 01:04:45.486
where a group of angry parents
are protesting the school's decision

01:04:45.521 --> 01:04:47.478
- to drug test...
- Who are you?

01:04:47.522 --> 01:04:50.514
- We're with Channel 5 News.
- That thing's on?

01:04:52.028 --> 01:04:53.120
Yes, we're live right now.

01:04:53.162 --> 01:04:55.426
What would you like to say
to Headmaster Gordon?

01:04:55.465 --> 01:04:58.765
- Is he watching?
- If he were watching.

01:04:59.837 --> 01:05:03.171
What do you mean "were"?
W- Was he watching?

01:05:03.208 --> 01:05:05.734
- Is this the past?
- Cut the feed.

01:05:05.778 --> 01:05:07.769
Is that that same school?

01:05:07.813 --> 01:05:10.247
The gas company dude
says that it's not a gas leak.

01:05:10.282 --> 01:05:12.843
We're checking the cafeteria
for salmonella.

01:05:12.886 --> 01:05:16.050
I mean, what else could it be, huh?

01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:18.581
- Asbestos?
- Those are the wrong symptoms, okay?

01:05:18.626 --> 01:05:20.857
This is... this is more psychological.

01:05:20.896 --> 01:05:24.731
It's kind of like
God's eye watching itself.

01:05:24.768 --> 01:05:25.962
Jesus!

01:05:26.002 --> 01:05:28.971
Why is everyone acting
like a bunch of baboons?

01:05:29.005 --> 01:05:31.304
Yeah, I don't know.

01:05:31.342 --> 01:05:34.403
It's... it's nuts, but we're having

01:05:34.446 --> 01:05:36.744
a choice brainstorming session
just like you asked.

01:05:36.782 --> 01:05:40.014
No one leaves this place
until we identify this problem.

01:05:40.052 --> 01:05:42.782
Think, people!
This thing is out of control!

01:05:42.822 --> 01:05:45.257
We have to shut it down!

01:05:46.894 --> 01:05:49.159
What? Hey.

01:05:53.769 --> 01:05:55.669
Just think, you did that.

01:05:55.704 --> 01:05:57.535
How's that for an accomplishment?

01:05:57.573 --> 01:05:59.235
Right?

01:05:59.276 --> 01:06:00.766
Oh, come on.

01:06:00.811 --> 01:06:02.780
Look, it's not like he's
irreparably damaged or anything.

01:06:02.814 --> 01:06:03.838
- Leave me alone, Breaux.
- He's gonna be fine.

01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:05.849
I am sick of your
pathological optimism.

01:06:05.883 --> 01:06:08.409
My life is in the shit-house
because of you.

01:06:08.453 --> 01:06:09.943
I didn't put a gat to your dome.

01:06:09.988 --> 01:06:13.152
You smoked that fatty.
You puffed down. You got high.

01:06:13.193 --> 01:06:15.821
You got you into this,
you judgmental hypocrite.

01:06:15.862 --> 01:06:18.058
And to think I did all this bullshit
to try and help you.

01:06:18.098 --> 01:06:20.066
I never had a single thing
to lose, dumbass.

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:21.591
Yeah, man, you don't need to tell me
you didn't have anything to lose.

01:06:21.636 --> 01:06:23.399
Everybody knows that.

01:06:26.909 --> 01:06:28.467
You know why we stopped
being homies, Henry?

01:06:28.511 --> 01:06:30.946
Come on, man.

01:06:30.981 --> 01:06:33.142
It's when your dad left your mom.

01:06:33.183 --> 01:06:35.583
And that puts you
in the same place as me.

01:06:35.619 --> 01:06:36.917
And having that thought
in your skull

01:06:36.955 --> 01:06:38.923
scared the shit
out of you, didn't it?

01:06:40.291 --> 01:06:42.283
That suddenly your life
could be anything like mine.

01:06:42.328 --> 01:06:45.058
- That's not true, man.
- Fuck you.

01:06:46.066 --> 01:06:48.159
You don't believe that truth,
then fuck you.

01:06:49.336 --> 01:06:52.363
Go ahead, give up,
because I'm not done yet.

01:06:52.406 --> 01:06:54.705
But I am sick and tired
of your candy-ass whining

01:06:54.743 --> 01:06:57.109
when fuckir one door
separates us from that footage.

01:06:57.145 --> 01:06:59.136
- And you can't...
- Man, even if we could get in there...

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:00.672
I mean, even if we could
destroy the footage...

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:02.184
I mean,
what about Psycho Ed?

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:04.049
Man, where are we
gonna get $50,000?

01:07:04.088 --> 01:07:07.854
Who is Psycho Ed?

01:07:07.892 --> 01:07:10.885
Suck my wispy left nut, Sebastian.
You don't know shit.

01:07:10.929 --> 01:07:12.658
Uh uh uh.

01:07:12.697 --> 01:07:16.395
I know that you two
got the student body

01:07:16.435 --> 01:07:20.133
and the faculty high
on marijuana brownies,

01:07:20.173 --> 01:07:23.803
all because you didn't wanna risk
screwing up your finals

01:07:23.845 --> 01:07:26.939
and losing valedictorian to me.

01:07:26.981 --> 01:07:29.280
And I know that
five minutes from now,

01:07:29.318 --> 01:07:30.945
Dr. Gordon will know
as much himself.

01:07:30.986 --> 01:07:31.975
If you say a word to anybody,

01:07:32.021 --> 01:07:33.455
there's gonna be an 18-7
up in this bitch.

01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:34.479
You feel me?

01:07:34.524 --> 01:07:36.583
- Ah! Okay, okay. Ow!
- What do you want, Sebastian?

01:07:36.626 --> 01:07:39.391
- Ow. Okay, okay. Fuck!
- What should have been mine.

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:42.025
And once you're exposed,

01:07:42.067 --> 01:07:44.399
- I'll have it.
- Okay. Ow! Ow!

01:07:44.436 --> 01:07:46.427
Sebastian, I'll throw
my English final.

01:07:48.074 --> 01:07:50.668
If I fail it, you're valedictorian.

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:52.906
When you're expelled,

01:07:52.947 --> 01:07:55.677
I'm valedictorian anyway, asshole.

01:07:55.716 --> 01:07:58.379
By default.

01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:01.447
But if I fail, you win
by beating my GPA,

01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:03.685
by earning it in the eyes
of everyone else.

01:08:06.330 --> 01:08:08.321
Fine.

01:08:08.365 --> 01:08:11.995
If you fail, Henry,
my lips are sealed.

01:08:15.374 --> 01:08:17.671
Yes!

01:08:20.747 --> 01:08:23.443
Do you people even realize

01:08:23.483 --> 01:08:26.510
the significance
of the Boston Tea Party?

01:08:26.554 --> 01:08:28.715
I mean, think about it...
it was tea.

01:08:30.192 --> 01:08:32.421
A mere beverage.

01:08:32.461 --> 01:08:36.057
It's like the beverage
gave the oppressed people...

01:08:38.501 --> 01:08:40.470
leverage.

01:08:40.504 --> 01:08:41.868
Beverage.

01:08:41.904 --> 01:08:45.933
- Say it with me, come on. Beverage.
- Class: Beverage.

01:08:45.977 --> 01:08:49.812
Be-ver-age, you know...

01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:52.647
Lick it real slowly, like...

01:08:52.685 --> 01:08:54.916
like it was the nipple,

01:08:54.955 --> 01:08:56.854
- the teat of your own mother.
- Beverage.

01:08:56.890 --> 01:08:58.381
Beverage.

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:00.792
Ooh!

01:09:00.828 --> 01:09:04.890
A sort of lurid chill goes
up and down my spine.

01:09:04.933 --> 01:09:07.127
Don't stop!
Please, don't stop!

01:09:07.169 --> 01:09:14.600
Beverage. Beverage.

01:09:14.645 --> 01:09:16.738
Beverage.

01:09:16.782 --> 01:09:20.741
Excuse me.
Is there a Mr. Henry Burke?

01:09:23.723 --> 01:09:26.283
You haven't visited us yet,
Mr. Burke.

01:09:26.326 --> 01:09:29.420
Can I borrow him
for five minutes, please?

01:09:29.462 --> 01:09:31.455
Say beverage.

01:09:31.499 --> 01:09:35.162
Nice and slow.

01:09:35.203 --> 01:09:37.604
- Beverage.
- What the shit?

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.474
- Beverage.
- Beverage, that's it.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:44.104
Beverage. Beverage.

01:09:45.115 --> 01:09:46.845
Thanks.

01:09:54.727 --> 01:09:56.718
All right, turn around.
Arms up.

01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:01.959
Any needles?
Sharp objects?

01:10:02.002 --> 01:10:03.970
- All right.
- What's this right here?

01:10:04.004 --> 01:10:06.974
Oh, it's your penis.

01:10:07.008 --> 01:10:08.839
Sorry about that.

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:18.188
Where have I felt this before?

01:10:18.222 --> 01:10:21.454
Campus Stadium,
best Dead concert ever.

01:10:21.493 --> 01:10:24.759
I toasted one just before
they opened with "US Blues."

01:10:24.797 --> 01:10:26.287
You were there, too?

01:10:26.332 --> 01:10:28.460
You remember when we heard
that it was gonna rain?

01:10:28.502 --> 01:10:32.063
And everybody joined hands,
young and old,

01:10:32.105 --> 01:10:35.803
- and we sang that rain away.
- We just sang it away.

01:10:37.412 --> 01:10:39.312
Fuck me.

01:10:39.348 --> 01:10:41.077
Whoa.

01:10:41.116 --> 01:10:45.850
We are all buttstonked.

01:10:45.889 --> 01:10:47.790
Nuh-uh.

01:10:47.825 --> 01:10:50.658
The sticky green.

01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:55.661
The cannabis sativa.

01:10:56.903 --> 01:11:00.498
The sinsemilla!

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:04.807
But how does someone
get the entire school roasted?

01:11:06.214 --> 01:11:09.012
Oh, I... I got it, I got it.

01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:11.042
I got it.

01:11:12.388 --> 01:11:15.050
No, I lost it.
I lost it.

01:11:15.090 --> 01:11:18.424
I lost it.

01:11:18.461 --> 01:11:20.453
I had it.

01:11:20.498 --> 01:11:22.591
You're useless.

01:11:29.274 --> 01:11:32.767
Wait, wait. Welcome back.

01:11:32.812 --> 01:11:36.681
- Woman: Oh, heart.
- Holy shit, that scared me.

01:11:37.918 --> 01:11:40.717
Tameka, it's Brandon!

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:42.586
Quarantine the brownies

01:11:42.624 --> 01:11:45.287
and send one away
to get tested, okay?

01:11:45.328 --> 01:11:49.288
Okay. Oh, and bring me
a box of Cheez-lts.

01:11:49.333 --> 01:11:51.096
All right, thanks.

01:11:52.302 --> 01:11:56.034
Hey, Brandon,
how does a brownie take a test?

01:12:10.157 --> 01:12:12.786
Attention.

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:15.194
Can you hear me?

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:18.928
Hello, this is Brandon.

01:12:18.968 --> 01:12:22.700
Um, all uneaten brownies
need to be brought

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:24.298
to the administration offices.

01:12:25.309 --> 01:12:26.800
Oh, no.

01:12:26.845 --> 01:12:27.937
They have been contaminated,

01:12:27.979 --> 01:12:30.140
so, please, don't eat them.

01:12:30.181 --> 01:12:32.343
Please?

01:12:32.385 --> 01:12:34.046
Don't... don't.

01:12:34.086 --> 01:12:37.716
There is no need to panic.

01:12:37.758 --> 01:12:41.160
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:12:41.195 --> 01:12:43.129
Okay?

01:12:44.866 --> 01:12:47.597
Everything is rad.

01:13:10.798 --> 01:13:13.562
Mr. Burke, first time late,

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.535
ever.

01:13:20.242 --> 01:13:24.179
Ah, well, it appears
you've all had a pleasant lunch.

01:13:24.214 --> 01:13:27.274
- The salmon was boss.
- And the brownies were to die for.

01:13:27.317 --> 01:13:30.253
So moist, so delicious.

01:13:30.288 --> 01:13:32.518
Oh, my.

01:13:32.557 --> 01:13:34.150
Shit.

01:13:34.193 --> 01:13:36.821
This is a private meeting room.

01:13:36.862 --> 01:13:40.128
You're fuckir with me.
Arert you?

01:13:41.134 --> 01:13:42.625
I'm...

01:13:47.442 --> 01:13:50.502
I just... I didn't
expect it to be so sad.

01:13:53.883 --> 01:13:56.876
All those books,
all that fire, I...

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:59.411
- Are you done with that?
- Oh, yeah, go for it.

01:14:02.827 --> 01:14:05.796
- Clean yourself up, Miss Tombs.
- Fuck you.

01:14:05.831 --> 01:14:07.765
Oh, my God.

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.234
Dr. Gordon?

01:14:10.269 --> 01:14:12.864
Brandon wanted me to tell you
that all the marijuana brownies

01:14:12.906 --> 01:14:14.703
have been quarantined.

01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:18.270
Um, what does she mean?

01:14:22.151 --> 01:14:25.553
Um, there's been an incident,

01:14:25.588 --> 01:14:27.180
but everything's
under control, I assure...

01:14:27.223 --> 01:14:28.918
The brownies we just ate?

01:14:28.958 --> 01:14:33.794
They were more than likely,

01:14:33.831 --> 01:14:38.496
uh, tainted with, ahem,

01:14:38.537 --> 01:14:40.335
marijuana.

01:14:44.478 --> 01:14:48.039
Yes, I... I think you're right.
Do you all feel that?

01:14:48.081 --> 01:14:50.175
It's kind of like my soul

01:14:50.218 --> 01:14:52.584
were swimming
within my own flesh.

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:54.851
It's rousing.

01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:58.991
I think I just came.

01:14:59.029 --> 01:15:01.896
Next up... Mr. Burke.

01:15:25.527 --> 01:15:29.396
Um, "To be or not to be"...

01:15:29.432 --> 01:15:31.958
Shakespeare's great question
to his character Hamlet,

01:15:32.002 --> 01:15:35.335
his great challenge
to his audience in 1600

01:15:35.372 --> 01:15:38.638
and today,
over 400 years later.

01:15:44.783 --> 01:15:47.252
Hamlet, huh?

01:15:47.287 --> 01:15:49.312
What a fuckir pussy.

01:15:49.356 --> 01:15:50.881
I mean, I didn't even read it.

01:15:50.925 --> 01:15:54.292
I just Netflixed the DVD with
that "Mad Max" douche-bag in it,

01:15:54.328 --> 01:15:57.765
but his uncle
iced his father, right?

01:15:57.799 --> 01:16:00.735
Popped an 18-7 up in that motherfucker
and he's talking to ghosts and shit?

01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:02.965
All like, "Daddy, Daddy,
what am I gonna do?

01:16:03.006 --> 01:16:04.030
What am I gonna do?"

01:16:04.073 --> 01:16:06.736
I mean, bitch, grow a pair
of clackers and snap out of it.

01:16:06.777 --> 01:16:08.711
I mean, clearly this dude
needs some help.

01:16:10.949 --> 01:16:13.713
Sad thing is

01:16:13.752 --> 01:16:17.120
every time I think about Hamlet,
I think about myself...

01:16:18.926 --> 01:16:24.763
too... too cautious, too deliberate,
planned perfection.

01:16:24.799 --> 01:16:26.733
I'm reaching
for the unreachable,

01:16:26.768 --> 01:16:29.704
something that, quite honestly,
I don't think is there.

01:16:29.738 --> 01:16:32.298
And I get caught up in the bullshit
of trying to be perfect.

01:16:32.341 --> 01:16:35.641
I forget about
what's right in front of me,

01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:39.343
like the... like the other
aspects of my life.

01:16:41.619 --> 01:16:45.784
My mom's gonna love me
whether or not I go to MIT.

01:16:45.824 --> 01:16:48.350
And, you know,
being valedictorian

01:16:48.394 --> 01:16:49.884
is not that big a deal, really.

01:16:49.929 --> 01:16:51.693
I mean, it may seem
important now,

01:16:51.732 --> 01:16:53.529
but in 10 years, you know,
that's just gonna be shit

01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:55.535
that made me miss
the other moments,

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:59.472
the stuff I wanted to do

01:16:59.507 --> 01:17:02.705
but I talked myself out of,

01:17:02.745 --> 01:17:06.477
stuff my heart wants
but logic would trip over

01:17:06.516 --> 01:17:11.648
like grabbing life by the balls

01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:14.317
and going after the girl
I always thought was hot.

01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:20.863
She's too hot for me.

01:17:23.169 --> 01:17:25.161
So what's the point?

01:17:27.108 --> 01:17:31.102
When you want
so hard for it to be

01:17:31.146 --> 01:17:33.944
and it's just not to be,

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:35.974
there's nothing
you can do about it.

01:17:43.661 --> 01:17:46.426
Uh, so anyway...

01:17:48.934 --> 01:17:52.597
Hamlet's a punk-ass bitch
and Shakespeare's massively overrated.

01:17:58.413 --> 01:18:00.108
Oh, shit.

01:18:10.427 --> 01:18:11.655
Oh, fuck.

01:18:19.337 --> 01:18:21.532
Yo, Henry.

01:18:27.448 --> 01:18:29.916
I'll go out with you, dude.

01:18:32.353 --> 01:18:33.843
Yeah.

01:18:35.557 --> 01:18:38.721
Okay. Well, that's all
I wanted to say.

01:18:38.761 --> 01:18:41.925
# There's a lot of lies #

01:18:41.965 --> 01:18:46.596
# I'd like to get out of my head... #

01:18:48.773 --> 01:18:50.537
Jesus.

01:18:51.844 --> 01:18:54.278
You're not sayir that because
you're high as fuck right now, right?

01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:56.942
High as fuck right now?

01:18:56.983 --> 01:18:58.917
# Out of my head... #

01:18:58.952 --> 01:19:02.582
- We all are.
- # Out of my head... #

01:19:09.465 --> 01:19:11.865
# Out of my head. #

01:19:11.901 --> 01:19:15.633
Hey, I thought we had a deal.

01:19:18.041 --> 01:19:19.475
You know what?

01:19:19.511 --> 01:19:22.309
You can go fuck yourself,
you warped piece of shit.

01:19:25.217 --> 01:19:27.378
Bravo, Henry.

01:19:34.529 --> 01:19:37.396
Salutatoriars
a pretty big deal, too.

01:19:41.103 --> 01:19:42.799
Tameka, have Brandon pull up

01:19:42.839 --> 01:19:45.388
the surveillance footage
from the gym this morning

01:19:45.423 --> 01:19:47.938
and summon Travis Breaux
and Henry Burke to my office.

01:19:47.978 --> 01:19:50.469
Oh, and put on a fresh pot of coffee.

01:19:58.925 --> 01:20:01.827
- Ahh.
- Right away, Dr. Gordon, but...

01:20:01.862 --> 01:20:03.853
No buts, Tameka.

01:20:03.897 --> 01:20:08.392
Except yours
in my face, you fuckir...

01:20:11.373 --> 01:20:15.434
It's just that Travis Breaux
is already here to see you, sir.

01:20:35.236 --> 01:20:37.796
# I know you're livir life
in a hurry #

01:20:37.838 --> 01:20:41.400
# So afraid to take it slow,
'cause reality is scary... #

01:20:41.443 --> 01:20:42.705
Henry Burke,

01:20:42.744 --> 01:20:44.906
please report
to the administration office.

01:20:46.649 --> 01:20:50.108
Henry Burke, please report
to the administration office.

01:20:50.153 --> 01:20:52.451
Shit!

01:20:52.489 --> 01:20:55.220
Where the fuck
is the administration office, man?

01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:59.698
# Ooh, oh, how the hell
did shit get so real? #

01:20:59.732 --> 01:21:02.633
# It's hard for me to deal #

01:21:02.668 --> 01:21:07.436
# Sometimes I just sit and think,
I thought it would be... #

01:21:07.474 --> 01:21:11.502
I've never felt so good in my life!
It feels so good!

01:21:13.181 --> 01:21:15.308
It feels so good

01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:17.683
to be alive

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:20.951
and an assistant dean!

01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:23.926
# I swear I never felt so alive... #

01:21:23.961 --> 01:21:28.160
Sunshine! Oh!

01:21:31.169 --> 01:21:33.263
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Goose?

01:21:33.306 --> 01:21:36.105
- It's me. I've got the video up.
- Bitchir.

01:21:36.143 --> 01:21:37.906
So I'm just gonna burn a copy
and bring it up

01:21:37.945 --> 01:21:39.276
to Dr. Gordors office, then.

01:21:39.313 --> 01:21:42.249
No, wait... no.
No, no, no.

01:21:42.283 --> 01:21:44.274
Make a copy, don't burn it.

01:21:44.319 --> 01:21:46.880
Make a copy and then bring it
to Dr. Gordors office.

01:21:46.922 --> 01:21:49.948
Don't burn it. Idiot.

01:21:49.992 --> 01:21:52.393
Henry Burke, please report

01:21:52.429 --> 01:21:53.919
to the administration office
immediately.

01:21:53.964 --> 01:21:57.093
- Aw, shit!
- Busted.

01:21:57.134 --> 01:21:59.625
- What do we do?
- Hide the rest of the evidence.

01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:01.195
Where did we leave it?

01:22:09.717 --> 01:22:13.209
Tameka: "Tameka.
Oh, Tameka, I need my coffee.

01:22:13.253 --> 01:22:14.482
Black, extra sugar."

01:22:14.522 --> 01:22:16.888
Choke on it, motherfucker.

01:22:37.316 --> 01:22:39.717
Just set it down.

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:52.592
My lord,
that's fucking good coffee.

01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:59.402
Big day for you,
Mr. Breaux? Yes?

01:23:00.811 --> 01:23:02.871
Yes.

01:23:05.884 --> 01:23:07.648
Fuck!

01:23:14.027 --> 01:23:16.258
Girls: Whoa! Hey!

01:23:19.567 --> 01:23:21.934
Just so you know,
I have surveillance footage

01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:24.302
being brought over here right now,

01:23:24.339 --> 01:23:28.003
footage that caught you and all
your demonic acts in plain view...

01:23:28.044 --> 01:23:31.208
you and our valedictorian,
Mr. Burke.

01:23:33.084 --> 01:23:35.144
Henry has nothing to do with this.

01:23:35.187 --> 01:23:38.281
So, you admit that you did?

01:23:44.331 --> 01:23:47.164
Normally, discipline
is a passive exercise for me.

01:23:47.201 --> 01:23:49.830
On rare occasion
I do relish it.

01:23:49.871 --> 01:23:53.433
I must admit that
when you go down, and...

01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:57.672
Believe me, you will
go down hard for this,

01:23:57.713 --> 01:23:59.978
I will consider it
one of the highlights

01:24:00.016 --> 01:24:04.511
of my career... nay, my life.

01:24:11.864 --> 01:24:14.333
Oh, no, helicopters.

01:24:24.846 --> 01:24:26.712
What? What is he doing?

01:24:26.749 --> 01:24:28.216
What's wrong with that kid?

01:24:28.251 --> 01:24:30.515
I'll admit I'm no gem
of a student,

01:24:30.553 --> 01:24:33.182
and for whatever stress I've put
my teachers through over the years,

01:24:33.223 --> 01:24:36.421
I'm genuinely sorry,
but there's something worse

01:24:36.461 --> 01:24:39.521
than a kid who breaks the rules,
fucks around, tokes down

01:24:39.564 --> 01:24:43.763
on a bit of hakeem marijuolajuwon
now and again.

01:24:43.802 --> 01:24:47.000
A middle-aged pimp
who pretends to be the judge

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.167
of all that is right
and good in the world.

01:24:49.209 --> 01:24:51.075
What happened to you?

01:24:51.112 --> 01:24:53.205
Did you fail miserably
somewhere along the lines

01:24:53.247 --> 01:24:55.580
as a husband?
A parent?

01:24:55.617 --> 01:24:57.141
You think that if you purify

01:24:57.186 --> 01:24:59.849
your Morgan High
Kingdom of Nastiness,

01:24:59.889 --> 01:25:01.186
you somehow purify yourself?

01:25:01.224 --> 01:25:02.748
Is that it?

01:25:06.130 --> 01:25:08.291
Well, the answer is...

01:25:10.468 --> 01:25:11.958
no.

01:25:19.813 --> 01:25:22.441
What the shit?!
What are you doing?

01:25:22.482 --> 01:25:24.246
Get... get out of the van!

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:27.482
- What?
- Get out of my fuckir van!

01:25:27.522 --> 01:25:29.548
You broke the law,

01:25:29.592 --> 01:25:31.992
you dosed the entire faculty
and student body

01:25:32.027 --> 01:25:34.019
with hazardous amounts of THC,

01:25:34.064 --> 01:25:38.297
and you are going
to jail, Breaux,

01:25:38.336 --> 01:25:40.600
where you belong.

01:25:40.638 --> 01:25:42.766
Oh, hell...

01:25:42.808 --> 01:25:45.675
What the shit?
You get the fuck out of my van!

01:25:50.383 --> 01:25:52.147
Whoa! Fuck!

01:25:52.186 --> 01:25:54.347
Oh, fuck! Oh!

01:26:01.964 --> 01:26:04.762
Oh, piss is on me!

01:26:10.507 --> 01:26:13.477
My God, he is good.

01:26:14.946 --> 01:26:17.541
Checkmate, Navaline.

01:26:17.583 --> 01:26:20.074
Checkmate.

01:26:21.288 --> 01:26:24.223
You should see
your face right now.

01:26:24.257 --> 01:26:27.455
You look like my cat,

01:26:27.495 --> 01:26:30.397
Dolly,

01:26:30.432 --> 01:26:36.167
just as we pierced her abscess
sans nitrous oxide.

01:26:36.205 --> 01:26:38.639
You prick.

01:26:51.624 --> 01:26:53.559
Tick, tick, tick.

01:27:13.284 --> 01:27:15.343
Are the police here,
God damn it?

01:27:15.386 --> 01:27:17.378
They're on their way.

01:27:20.859 --> 01:27:23.693
Time seems to be moving
very slowly.

01:27:25.932 --> 01:27:28.299
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:27:31.573 --> 01:27:35.031
Aw, hell, no.

01:27:35.076 --> 01:27:37.272
- What?
- What?

01:27:37.313 --> 01:27:41.878
- What?
- What?

01:27:46.991 --> 01:27:48.219
Dr. Gordon:
Wha...

01:28:14.391 --> 01:28:16.951
Tameka, have any more
of that coffee?

01:28:16.994 --> 01:28:19.520
Oh, yeah, I should score
some of that.

01:28:19.564 --> 01:28:21.555
You already drank
all the coffee, sir.

01:28:21.599 --> 01:28:23.260
Damn!

01:28:23.301 --> 01:28:26.703
- Going to a Huey Lewis concert?
- Why? Is he on tour again?

01:28:26.739 --> 01:28:28.206
Entrez-vous.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.209
Sorry about the delay.

01:28:30.243 --> 01:28:32.643
Something weird happened
to the ray drive.

01:28:32.679 --> 01:28:34.978
Luckily, though, I was able
to make a back-up

01:28:35.016 --> 01:28:36.643
before everything crashed.

01:28:36.684 --> 01:28:39.848
Perfect.
Go on, show it to us.

01:28:39.888 --> 01:28:42.356
If a picture is won'th 1,000 words,

01:28:42.391 --> 01:28:46.829
then this footage should be
won'th 1,000 pictures,

01:28:46.863 --> 01:28:51.665
which would equal
a million... words.

01:28:53.572 --> 01:28:57.373
Uh, Tameka,
bring the Johnson file.

01:28:57.410 --> 01:29:00.675
- Wait, this isn't...
- Dr. Gordon on TV: Shut the door.

01:29:10.058 --> 01:29:13.153
- Where would you like it?
- The filing cabinet, please.

01:29:13.195 --> 01:29:16.757
- Malcolm, what's going on around here?
- I'll show you where I'd like it.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.633
- What is... what... stop it!
- Sweetie, it's all right.

01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:22.833
Dr. Gordon, get off!
That's my underwear, Dr. Gordon.

01:29:22.874 --> 01:29:25.537
- What are you doing?
- Stupid elastic. God damn it.

01:29:25.577 --> 01:29:27.670
- Get... get off of me!
- Daddy wants some chocolate!

01:29:27.713 --> 01:29:29.909
Motherfucker,
this ain't "Monster's Ball!"

01:29:29.949 --> 01:29:32.850
- Dr. Gordon, get off! Get off!
- Talk to me, baby!

01:29:32.886 --> 01:29:35.981
I don't understand the... I...

01:29:36.023 --> 01:29:38.617
- This is preposterous!
- Back up!

01:29:38.659 --> 01:29:40.719
You want your nuts stapled together?
Is that what you want?

01:29:40.762 --> 01:29:42.525
- No, no.
- What is wrong with you? What the fuck?

01:29:42.564 --> 01:29:45.090
- I'm... I'm...
- Motherfucker, you ain't Billy Bob

01:29:45.134 --> 01:29:46.601
- just 'cause you have a porn stash.
- What?

01:29:46.636 --> 01:29:49.663
- Never do that... never do that again.
- I promise I won't, Tameka.

01:29:49.706 --> 01:29:51.799
You don't understand.
My wife has crabs.

01:29:51.842 --> 01:29:53.572
- Ooh.
- I can't help it. I'm...

01:29:53.611 --> 01:29:55.738
You two, you can go now.

01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:58.078
Wait! I've still got your piss.

01:29:58.116 --> 01:30:00.312
I've got your pissss.

01:30:00.352 --> 01:30:03.049
If there's so much
as an errant molecule,

01:30:03.089 --> 01:30:06.456
you will have to spend
the rest of your lives

01:30:06.493 --> 01:30:09.554
sans a high school diploma.

01:30:09.597 --> 01:30:13.034
That's assuming
inculpatory facts not in evidence.

01:30:13.068 --> 01:30:15.332
Reveal your identity, sir.

01:30:15.370 --> 01:30:17.601
- Shit, it's a trap.
- What?

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:19.608
The police put a transmitter
in my teeth.

01:30:19.642 --> 01:30:22.305
I'm Edward Esquire,
cheese-dick.

01:30:22.346 --> 01:30:26.248
And it violates
"Katz v United States," 1964,

01:30:26.283 --> 01:30:27.876
when the Supreme Court
set the standards

01:30:27.919 --> 01:30:29.648
for reasonable
expectations of privacy.

01:30:29.688 --> 01:30:34.888
Certainly, one could argue
that piss is highly private.

01:30:36.396 --> 01:30:38.557
Furthermore,
any statements by you

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:40.624
regarding these
two little assholes

01:30:40.667 --> 01:30:43.228
won't stand up
in court because

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:47.072
you're blind off your gourd on
really high-caliber mari-hoo-hoo, bro.

01:30:48.978 --> 01:30:50.947
Drug test his ass, man.

01:30:50.981 --> 01:30:53.006
Would you agree to submit
to a drug test, sir?

01:30:53.049 --> 01:30:54.539
- L...
- For the record,

01:30:54.584 --> 01:30:56.815
he made it very clear
he didn't have any of the brownies.

01:30:56.854 --> 01:30:59.448
Wha... honey-pie.

01:30:59.490 --> 01:31:02.756
Would you agree
to kiss my hairy sack?

01:31:02.794 --> 01:31:05.821
If you wanna sue this prick
for workplace sexual harassment

01:31:05.865 --> 01:31:08.891
or, uh, score a chronic
sack of doobies,

01:31:08.935 --> 01:31:11.564
just, you know, page me.

01:31:11.605 --> 01:31:15.337
Uh, Mr. Esquire?
Can I have a card?

01:31:17.412 --> 01:31:19.040
Did he molest you, too?

01:31:19.081 --> 01:31:21.845
- In my mind.
- That's nasty, dude.

01:31:25.489 --> 01:31:27.013
Thanks.

01:31:41.508 --> 01:31:43.670
Dr. Gordon, what do you have
to say to the parents outside?

01:31:43.711 --> 01:31:46.839
My... my balls feel all tingly.

01:31:46.881 --> 01:31:50.079
Hi, son.

01:31:50.118 --> 01:31:52.417
- Hi.
- Fuck you.

01:31:52.455 --> 01:31:54.389
Oh, how pleasant.

01:31:54.424 --> 01:31:56.358
10-4. Principal is in custody,
transporting back to station.

01:32:08.808 --> 01:32:10.742
Take it easy!

01:32:10.776 --> 01:32:12.472
Oh, I don't like that.

01:32:12.512 --> 01:32:16.643
My colon.
Oh, my spastic colon!

01:32:18.753 --> 01:32:21.154
Hey, you bastards!

01:33:06.611 --> 01:33:11.015
We should, uh, you know,
kick it again sometime.

01:33:11.049 --> 01:33:13.746
Come on, man.

01:33:13.787 --> 01:33:15.448
- Be somebody.
- Oh.

01:33:19.326 --> 01:33:20.759
Be somebody.

01:33:20.795 --> 01:33:22.286
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- No, no.

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:23.854
- Be somebody.
- Be somebody.

01:33:23.899 --> 01:33:25.992
- Be somebody.
- Got to... got to be somebody.

01:33:26.034 --> 01:33:27.400
Twing, twing.

01:33:27.436 --> 01:33:28.767
Weed done finally kicked in, man.

01:33:28.805 --> 01:33:30.898
Yo, that's some
four-dimensional shit.

01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:34.172
Where the fuck
is the administration office?

01:33:34.211 --> 01:33:36.510
Are you fucking with me?

01:33:36.548 --> 01:33:38.449
- What?
- What?

01:39:13.222 --> 01:39:16.419
Beverage, beverage.

01:39:16.458 --> 01:39:20.293
Beverage, beverage.

01:39:23.167 --> 01:39:25.829
Class dismissed.

01:39:29.307 --> 01:39:32.903
Cut.
