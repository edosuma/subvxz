00:06.226 --> 00:07.469
Hey!

00:07.511 --> 00:09.188
Welcome to the
Freedom Tunnel.

00:09.222 --> 00:10.498
Are you guys painters?

00:10.809 --> 00:15.214
Well, no. But as you can see,
I am an artiste.

00:15.248 --> 00:18.939
My medium is fabric, seasonal
fruits, and cuddly creatures.

00:18.973 --> 00:23.888
That's cool. Your art sounds
delicious and fuzzy.

00:24.694 --> 00:26.165
What is this place anyway?

00:26.199 --> 00:28.374
It used to be
an abandoned train tunnel,

00:28.409 --> 00:30.620
but now it's been set aside
by the city for artists

00:30.654 --> 00:32.290
to paint whatever they want.

00:32.593 --> 00:35.570
Or hiding when they have a
fight with their girlfriends.

00:36.608 --> 00:38.581
We're looking for Alex Russo.

00:38.616 --> 00:40.021
Follow me.

00:40.056 --> 00:41.895
Thank you.

00:41.930 --> 00:45.439
Oh! What's this supposed to be?

00:46.477 --> 00:48.282
It's a question mark.

00:48.317 --> 00:51.592
No, I know what it is,
but what's it mean?

00:51.626 --> 00:56.340
It means whatever you
want it to mean, man.

00:58.614 --> 01:00.854
I think it means he hasn't
decided what to paint yet.

01:02.193 --> 01:05.336
- Hey, Alex.
- Hey, Line.

01:05.370 --> 01:09.582
I get it. It's a car
symbol in a tunnel,

01:09.616 --> 01:11.255
on a cracked wall,

01:11.289 --> 01:14.164
representing
the death of industry.

01:14.198 --> 01:18.509
No, it's my initial in a
circle, representing...

01:18.544 --> 01:20.750
...my initial in a circle.

01:20.784 --> 01:22.187
Hey, Larry.

01:23.358 --> 01:25.696
I was wrong.
Way off. Yeah.

01:25.730 --> 01:29.307
It is her initial
inside a circle.

01:29.341 --> 01:30.945
Congratulations, Alex.

01:30.980 --> 01:32.448
I'm the president
of the committee.

01:32.751 --> 01:34.153
I'm supposed to
congratulate her first.

01:34.454 --> 01:36.988
Well, I'm vice president.
What do I get to do?

01:37.023 --> 01:39.090
After I congratulate her,
you get to wish her well.

01:39.258 --> 01:41.225
Oh, for the love.
Would somebody congratulate me

01:41.260 --> 01:43.157
and then tell me what for?

01:43.192 --> 01:46.156
The Tribeca Prep
Mural Paint Committee

01:46.191 --> 01:48.893
had a meeting and I nominated
you to be mural painter.

01:48.927 --> 01:52.132
Oh, my gosh. You nominated me
to paint a mural for the school?

01:52.166 --> 01:53.201
No.

01:55.139 --> 01:56.507
Alex, I need your help.

01:56.708 --> 01:58.277
The rest of the submissions
were terrible.

01:58.578 --> 02:00.448
So I told them about how
you do murals down here

02:00.482 --> 02:01.917
and they all
agreed to it.

02:02.419 --> 02:04.790
I questioned why I even brought
it up, but it was too late.

02:04.824 --> 02:07.594
- Don't let me down.
- Yeah, don't let him down.

02:07.629 --> 02:11.101
I'd say don't let me down,
but you could never let me down.

02:11.135 --> 02:13.538
Anymore.

02:13.573 --> 02:17.847
Paint a mural for the whole
school? I don't know.

02:17.881 --> 02:20.485
You'll get out
of class to do it.

02:20.519 --> 02:24.558
Well, then, you should have
said that first. What an honor.

03:20.983 --> 03:24.353
Your choice of side salad,
cole slaw, or French fries.

03:24.388 --> 03:26.690
- Max? What are you doing?
- Yeah?

03:26.725 --> 03:28.326
I'm making a video menu.

03:28.527 --> 03:30.829
We have so many options that
I can't remember them all,

03:30.864 --> 03:33.466
so I'm just going to play
this for the customers.

03:35.103 --> 03:37.038
We are gonna start
hiring people to work here

03:37.073 --> 03:39.075
who aren't related to me.

03:39.109 --> 03:41.578
You'd have to pay them, Dad.

03:41.612 --> 03:43.748
Oh. That's why I don't do it.

03:52.094 --> 03:55.096
Oh, he did
the wrong thing.

03:59.101 --> 04:01.702
I got the whole thing on video.

04:01.736 --> 04:03.670
This is so going
on the Internet.

04:05.306 --> 04:06.939
What do you say?
Can I put it on the Internet?

04:07.074 --> 04:08.574
Oh, sure.
Sure you can.

04:08.808 --> 04:11.609
I want everyone to know
how rude my customers are.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.976
Don't smile.
I saw you laughing.

04:25.323 --> 04:27.157
I stayed up all night
working on these.

04:27.191 --> 04:29.125
Either one would
make a great mural.

04:29.159 --> 04:33.761
Especially the one that
I'm sliding closer to you.

04:35.730 --> 04:37.598
Which one do you think
I should go with?

04:37.632 --> 04:40.766
Oh, honey.
It doesn't even matter.

04:40.801 --> 04:46.338
What matters is that you're finally doing
something for someone other than yourself.

04:51.109 --> 04:53.577
We just need to savor
this moment.

04:54.779 --> 04:56.980
Excuse me.

04:57.014 --> 05:00.516
I know, honey. I know.
It's a miracle.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.384
- We're good parents.
- Yes!

05:03.419 --> 05:06.353
Wow. Look at all those sketches.

05:06.388 --> 05:08.288
You're really going
all out for this mural.

05:08.323 --> 05:09.389
No, I'm not.

05:09.423 --> 05:11.590
I just want to make it good,

05:11.624 --> 05:13.891
because I have to look at
the stupid thing everyday.

05:13.925 --> 05:16.259
Except this one's not stupid.
It's really awesome.

05:16.293 --> 05:17.560
But I'm not excited about it.

05:17.594 --> 05:19.795
Say whatever you want.

05:19.829 --> 05:21.429
We all know how much
you care about this.

05:21.464 --> 05:23.830
It does seem like you care.

05:24.865 --> 05:26.966
I'm just sayin'.

05:29.101 --> 05:32.102
The Alien Language League has
moved up a bracket in the debates.

05:32.304 --> 05:35.907
It's exciting. So, I'm not going to be
here to oversee the progress on the mural.

05:35.942 --> 05:37.844
Your vice president is on it.

05:37.878 --> 05:40.647
Great. Text me progress reports
every five minutes.

05:45.959 --> 05:49.261
Who's gonna destroy Peakskill High at
tomorrow's Alien Language League debates?

05:49.295 --> 05:53.231
Tribeca Prep. We're gonna
gee n'or their bla-nee-kan.

05:53.266 --> 05:57.068
I heard there's gonna be
an actual scout from NASA

05:57.102 --> 05:59.736
in the audience.
Do you know what this means?

05:59.771 --> 06:03.940
We're gonna have an audience!

06:10.113 --> 06:13.314
So, it's called
New York: Above and Below.

06:13.348 --> 06:15.783
Above will be the pretty,
happy New York

06:15.817 --> 06:17.351
which makes me want to barf.

06:17.785 --> 06:21.388
And below will be the gritty,
grimy New York filled with barf.

06:24.625 --> 06:27.459
That's it.

06:29.228 --> 06:30.395
Excellent.

06:30.429 --> 06:32.830
My committee corral approves.

06:34.266 --> 06:37.833
If I can I'd just like
to make one little suggestion.

06:37.868 --> 06:40.035
Just a little cactus hair.

06:40.069 --> 06:43.706
I'd like to see more cowboys
in the above ground city.

06:45.309 --> 06:47.277
Cowboys? In my mural?

06:47.311 --> 06:50.345
Our mural.

06:50.379 --> 06:54.415
I think they would really represent
our country's great Manifest Destiny

06:54.449 --> 06:56.617
and "westward, ho" mentality.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.754
I think you're the only one who
knows what you're talking about.

07:01.788 --> 07:04.323
So, I think I'm just gonna
go on my own for this.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.724
Absolutely.
Go your own way.

07:06.758 --> 07:09.325
It's your vision. And you know
what your vision should have?

07:09.360 --> 07:12.128
Caricatures. I love it when
people's heads are too big

07:12.162 --> 07:13.363
for their bodies.

07:13.664 --> 07:16.266
And they always hold teeny
tiny tennis rackets.

07:19.636 --> 07:23.306
OK. So, giant heads, teeny
tiny tennis rackets...

07:23.340 --> 07:26.875
And how about a bunch of panda
bears riding on the subway?

07:29.245 --> 07:32.213
And the Statue of Liberty
shredding an electric guitar.

07:34.683 --> 07:36.483
And panda bears.

07:38.118 --> 07:40.019
If anyone else has another idea

07:40.053 --> 07:43.055
why not just write it down
and pass it in to Miss Russo.

07:43.089 --> 07:44.957
No, stop writing.

07:44.991 --> 07:47.892
Why do you all have scrap paper
immediately available?

07:49.394 --> 07:51.962
You'll do a bang-up job,
Miss Russo.

07:51.996 --> 07:53.630
Oh, nice.

07:55.199 --> 07:56.232
Harper...

07:56.266 --> 07:59.801
Times Square filled with pizzas?

07:59.835 --> 08:03.071
And look, this one just says,
"A picture of my grandma."

08:03.105 --> 08:05.672
Whose grandma? How I'm supposed
to know what she looks like?

08:05.707 --> 08:07.807
Oh, you've met
my Nana Franny.

08:07.842 --> 08:11.144
She does needle point,
fought in World War II.

08:11.178 --> 08:12.512
I'll get you a picture.

08:17.549 --> 08:19.916
All right, Max.
What's the big emergency?

08:20.084 --> 08:24.219
All right. Well, I put that video of
you on the Internet and got tons of hits.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.553
People loved it.

08:25.821 --> 08:27.755
So, if you jump on the other
end of this board for me

08:27.789 --> 08:30.691
I'll be launched up and land
safely on our terrace.

08:30.725 --> 08:32.626
And I'll put that
on the Internet.

08:32.660 --> 08:35.596
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold it right there.

08:35.630 --> 08:38.331
I got tons of hits?

08:38.365 --> 08:40.232
Oh, yeah, you did.
So come on.

08:40.267 --> 08:42.234
Jump on the other end,
and I'll become famous.

08:42.269 --> 08:43.969
The only thing
that's gonna happen

08:44.004 --> 08:45.737
is you'll be launched
two feet in the air,

08:45.772 --> 08:47.139
and you might break your arm.

08:47.173 --> 08:48.974
Dad, come on. Just jump.

08:49.008 --> 08:53.844
Fine. Just to show you how this
is not gonna work, I'll do it.

08:53.879 --> 08:55.112
Yes.

08:57.181 --> 08:58.315
Ready?

08:58.349 --> 09:01.251
- Yep.
- One, two, three.

09:05.855 --> 09:07.088
<i>I did it.</i>

09:08.957 --> 09:10.190
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

09:10.225 --> 09:12.960
<i>Knock it off!</i>

09:18.800 --> 09:20.667
You've sure packed
a lot in here...

09:20.702 --> 09:22.035
Pandas on the subway.

09:22.303 --> 09:25.404
The Statue of Liberty
playing electric guitar.

09:25.438 --> 09:27.205
And what's this?

09:27.239 --> 09:29.106
Is that a cowboy
with a giant head

09:29.140 --> 09:33.109
with a teeny tiny
tennis racket?

09:33.144 --> 09:36.212
I know it's a mess, but it's
just what everybody else wanted.

09:37.814 --> 09:41.617
Let me tell you something
very wise, all right, Alex?

09:41.651 --> 09:46.987
When it comes to art, beauty
is in the eye of the beholder.

09:47.022 --> 09:50.824
All right? It's impossible
to please everyone.

09:52.193 --> 09:55.227
You're probably right.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.629
Or maybe you're not.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.899
No, I'm definitely right.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.633
You can't please everyone.

10:02.667 --> 10:05.001
OK. I was trying to
make a dramatic exit.

10:05.035 --> 10:07.102
Oh! Oh, all right.

10:07.137 --> 10:08.203
Well, do your thing.

10:08.238 --> 10:10.939
OK. Thank you.

10:10.974 --> 10:12.974
You're probably right.

10:13.009 --> 10:15.543
Or maybe you're not.

10:18.446 --> 10:19.780
Pretty good.

10:21.249 --> 10:23.216
<i>So it's called
The Eye of the Beholder spell.</i>

10:23.384 --> 10:25.351
It makes everybody see
what they want to see.

10:25.385 --> 10:27.453
- I'll cast it on the wall...
- Hey, hey, hey.

10:27.487 --> 10:29.288
As vice president
of the mural committee,

10:29.389 --> 10:31.124
I can absolutely not
condone the use of...

10:31.158 --> 10:33.793
Magic...

10:33.828 --> 10:35.729
...as a means
to artistic expression.

10:35.763 --> 10:40.300
- Are you done?
- Are you still gonna use magic?

10:41.269 --> 10:43.237
- Yes.
- I'm done.

10:45.140 --> 10:47.140
The weight of this mural
is too much to shoulder.

10:47.175 --> 10:49.844
<i>Watch me use
The Eye of the Beholder.</i>

10:49.878 --> 10:51.879
I'm gonna have
to inform Justin.

10:55.049 --> 10:57.981
Oh, my gosh!

10:58.016 --> 11:00.248
It's Nana Franny.

11:06.250 --> 11:10.119
Oh, that's the most beautiful
mural I've ever seen.

11:10.153 --> 11:12.053
Oh, thank you, Alex.
Thank you. Thank you.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.627
What is all this commotion?

11:23.997 --> 11:26.498
Oh, Miss Russo.

11:26.532 --> 11:30.468
You've lassoed my soul.

11:33.104 --> 11:36.406
The perfect melding
of past and present.

11:36.441 --> 11:39.309
Time is relative.
History is cyclical.

11:39.343 --> 11:43.746
The cowboy shall once again
rule the western plains.

11:43.780 --> 11:47.483
Those cowboys look like
panda bears to me.

11:47.517 --> 11:51.018
Well, buckaroo, with great art
the interpretations are endless.

11:51.053 --> 11:53.187
Thank you, Mr. Laritate.

11:53.221 --> 11:55.656
Miss Russo,
there was a time

11:55.690 --> 11:57.558
when I thought you wouldn't
amount to much...

11:57.592 --> 12:00.294
That time was yesterday.

12:00.328 --> 12:03.130
But now look at you.

12:03.164 --> 12:06.166
You must be very proud to be
an artist who pleases everyone.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.268
You're a real people pleaser.

12:08.302 --> 12:11.637
People pleaser? Me?

12:11.671 --> 12:15.141
No, no, no.
I'm Alex Russo. I don't...

12:16.109 --> 12:17.642
I know.

12:17.677 --> 12:19.877
But look at how happy
everyone is.

12:22.314 --> 12:25.082
So if everybody else is happy,

12:25.116 --> 12:28.785
then that means I should be
happy too, right?

12:30.154 --> 12:33.055
That's how happiness works.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.961
Oh, I get it!

12:50.520 --> 12:51.586
<i>Knock it off!</i>

12:53.889 --> 12:54.956
That's um...

12:55.091 --> 12:56.824
That's some pretty
crazy stuff, huh?

12:56.859 --> 13:00.728
Yeah. Everybody's watching this.
It's going viral.

13:00.762 --> 13:02.062
What are you gonna do next?

13:03.798 --> 13:05.431
Next?

13:05.465 --> 13:08.766
I just launched myself onto
a two story terrace.

13:08.801 --> 13:11.168
That's cool.

13:11.202 --> 13:14.438
But you need to plus it, dude.
That's already been done.

13:14.472 --> 13:16.606
- By who?
- You.

13:16.641 --> 13:18.074
That's right.

13:20.077 --> 13:21.911
I do need to plus it.

13:21.945 --> 13:24.146
<i>Knock it off!</i>

13:27.817 --> 13:29.584
Hey, Harper, guess what?

13:29.618 --> 13:33.420
Peakskill High
didn't stand a chance.

13:33.454 --> 13:35.988
What can I say?
They didn't have a certain...

13:36.022 --> 13:38.022
...Justin Russo.
Thank you very much.

13:39.425 --> 13:41.059
Yeah, and next up...
Sachem High.

13:41.661 --> 13:43.662
And they better bring it or they're
going home, crying to their mommies

13:43.696 --> 13:45.596
on their little bikes
made up like starships.

13:45.697 --> 13:48.398
- Ooh!
- I wish we'd thought of that.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.967
Oh, my gosh.

13:52.001 --> 13:53.468
The mural.

13:57.039 --> 13:59.139
There's beakers,
test tubes and the...

13:59.173 --> 14:00.706
...the Action News weather lady

14:00.741 --> 14:03.709
giving an incredibly
accurate forecast.

14:03.744 --> 14:07.179
Wow! Robot president.

14:09.315 --> 14:11.616
This is awesome!

14:13.418 --> 14:14.852
Wait a second.

14:15.053 --> 14:18.989
I see test tubes. Zeke sees
robot president. And you see...

14:19.023 --> 14:20.323
Nana Franny.

14:20.357 --> 14:22.125
- Oops.
- Harper?

14:24.161 --> 14:26.762
<i>What's going on? Did Alex use
The Eye of the Beholder spell?</i>

14:26.796 --> 14:28.863
I don't know the name
of the spell she used.

14:29.131 --> 14:32.500
But if I was gonna name it,
I would probably name it that.

14:34.068 --> 14:36.969
You knew about her using magic?
Why didn't you text me?

14:37.003 --> 14:40.105
I just love seeing
Nana Franny so much.

14:40.139 --> 14:42.506
If you want my resignation
just say it.

14:43.242 --> 14:44.542
I want your resignation.

14:44.577 --> 14:46.010
La, la, la!
I can't hear you!

14:46.111 --> 14:47.845
Give me your...
Harper! Harper!

14:50.480 --> 14:52.581
Alex, I trusted you
to paint that mural

14:52.615 --> 14:54.615
and you just used magic
and blew it off?

14:54.816 --> 14:57.852
No, I had a great concept
and I was so excited about it.

14:57.886 --> 15:00.120
But everybody kept yelling
their ideas at me

15:00.154 --> 15:02.856
like I was some sort
of paint monkey.

15:02.890 --> 15:05.524
Alex, it's a committee.
It's what committees do.

15:05.559 --> 15:07.660
And now that you mention it
everything down here

15:07.694 --> 15:09.962
looks like it was painted
by monkeys.

15:11.630 --> 15:14.599
Using magic on the school wall
was completely reckless, Alex.

15:14.633 --> 15:16.868
Yeah, well, I'm the
one who's suffering.

15:16.902 --> 15:19.536
Mr. Laritate said I was
an artist who pleases everyone.

15:19.570 --> 15:22.772
And that's when I realized
I please everyone but myself.

15:22.806 --> 15:26.608
And you know what that is?
That's a sell out.

15:26.643 --> 15:29.945
- I'm a sell out.
- A sell out?

15:29.980 --> 15:32.614
- Who's a sell out?
- Me.

15:32.648 --> 15:36.383
I'm worse than that rapper who
did that washing machine ad.

15:36.418 --> 15:40.620
Wiki-wiki-wiki-wash...
Ridiculous.

15:40.655 --> 15:44.291
This is the mural I wanted to
paint for my school, but I didn't.

15:44.325 --> 15:46.026
So, why do you feel so bad?

15:46.294 --> 15:49.729
At least you painted what you
wanted. It's just down here.

15:49.763 --> 15:52.264
Look, let me tell you
about an artist I know

15:52.298 --> 15:54.666
who makes a living drawing
cheesy greeting cards.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.801
Let's say his name is um...

15:56.835 --> 15:58.035
...me.

15:58.070 --> 15:59.970
Am I a sell out?

16:00.005 --> 16:01.805
Of course.

16:03.841 --> 16:06.076
You draw greeting cards?

16:06.110 --> 16:07.977
Yeah, but the artistic
ones, right?

16:08.011 --> 16:10.312
Yeah, sure, if you think
a thermometer that says,

16:10.346 --> 16:12.514
"Get well soon," is artistic.

16:12.548 --> 16:13.748
That's you?

16:14.750 --> 16:16.785
The thermometer
clearly has a fever.

16:16.819 --> 16:19.787
I mean, a thermometer with
a thermometer in his mouth.

16:19.822 --> 16:22.327
That's... That's genius.

16:23.829 --> 16:25.696
- That's good.
- Yeah.

16:25.731 --> 16:29.866
When I draw that stuff, it
tortures me deep inside my soul.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.334
And it hurts.

16:31.368 --> 16:34.036
But I use that pain
to create all this.

16:34.071 --> 16:37.339
Down here.

16:37.373 --> 16:38.741
It's perfect.

16:38.775 --> 16:42.545
You're right, Line.
Thank you.

16:42.579 --> 16:45.948
I am now officially
a tunnel person.

16:45.982 --> 16:47.249
Yeah!

16:47.284 --> 16:49.585
Tunnel people!

16:49.619 --> 16:52.219
So, you're just gonna
do your art down here?

16:52.252 --> 16:53.753
Yes.

16:53.787 --> 16:56.488
And if you would just leave,
I would get a chance to do it.

16:56.523 --> 17:00.058
So you don't want your art to be
seen by anyone? I don't get that.

17:00.092 --> 17:02.393
That's because you're
not an artist.

17:02.428 --> 17:03.828
You're right.

17:03.863 --> 17:07.632
I could never paint a
question mark on a wall.

17:07.665 --> 17:09.467
Hey, Line.
He called you a monkey.

17:12.970 --> 17:15.070
That was before I knew about
that thermometer thing.

17:23.246 --> 17:25.113
All right.

17:25.147 --> 17:28.282
From down below,
this art should show.

17:35.089 --> 17:37.857
Oh, my gosh.
It's my mural.

17:37.892 --> 17:40.393
Alex, what did you do?

17:40.427 --> 17:45.564
Well, defacing school property is something
I would do and have done many, many times.

17:45.599 --> 17:47.900
But I can't take
credit for this one.

17:50.336 --> 17:53.304
This has nothing
to do with panda bears.

17:53.339 --> 17:56.440
I hate it and I'm
telling Mr. Laritate.

17:59.344 --> 18:03.046
Justin, I don't know how this
got here. I didn't move it.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.914
That must make you mad.

18:04.948 --> 18:07.749
No. Actually,
it kind of feels good

18:07.784 --> 18:10.185
to have everyone see
my original idea.

18:10.219 --> 18:13.454
Even though
they all hate it?

18:13.488 --> 18:16.423
That's OK.
At least they saw it.

18:16.457 --> 18:19.326
And even though they hate it,
it made them feel something.

18:19.360 --> 18:23.496
Well, then it looks like
I did it again. Boo yah.

18:23.530 --> 18:28.233
Justin, now is not the time for
your Alien Language League junk.

18:28.267 --> 18:31.136
No, no, no. I'm the one
who moved your mural.

18:31.170 --> 18:33.405
And did you see how I was
playing it like it wasn't me?

18:33.706 --> 18:36.507
I was like, "You must be mad,"
and "What if they take it down?"

18:36.542 --> 18:39.910
And you were like: "Now I know why I'm
an artist, because they all hate it."

18:39.944 --> 18:42.478
When really it was me
the whole time.

18:42.513 --> 18:44.547
I was acting.

18:47.117 --> 18:49.051
I can't believe you did
all that for me.

18:49.085 --> 18:51.086
Well, you're the artist
and you're my sister,

18:51.120 --> 18:52.987
and I think your work
deserves to be seen.

18:53.022 --> 18:55.323
Thank you.

18:55.357 --> 18:57.725
Don't get the wrong idea.
I hate the mural.

18:59.227 --> 19:01.528
The message is heavy handed.
The theme's been done before.

19:01.562 --> 19:05.398
And your trees look like
big, green lollipops.

19:05.432 --> 19:08.834
Yeah, I gotta
work on my foliage.

19:11.571 --> 19:14.838
Miss Russo, this is not
what we discussed.

19:14.873 --> 19:17.375
What happened to that
handsome cowboy?

19:17.409 --> 19:21.411
You asked me to paint
the mural, and I did.

19:21.446 --> 19:23.380
And I'm not going
to change it one bit.

19:23.781 --> 19:26.549
President of the mural committee,
how could you let this happen?

19:26.584 --> 19:29.618
I left my vice president
in charge when I was gone.

19:32.121 --> 19:34.422
That's right.

19:34.457 --> 19:35.957
He did.

19:35.991 --> 19:39.360
And I will go find her.

19:42.196 --> 19:44.831
No, no, no.
It's not their fault.

19:44.865 --> 19:47.033
Mr. Laritate, I'm sorry,
but from now on,

19:47.067 --> 19:49.068
I'm gonna paint
what I want to paint.

19:50.170 --> 19:52.271
Artists are so temperamental.

20:03.676 --> 20:06.077
All right,
so what I'm gonna do

20:06.111 --> 20:09.780
is jump this unicycle,
right here...

20:09.814 --> 20:12.281
...over all of these
garbage cans, wearing...

20:12.315 --> 20:14.183
...this bubble wrap.

20:15.785 --> 20:18.586
Do you think you could run up and
jump those trash cans on your own?

20:18.620 --> 20:19.853
No way, dude.

20:19.888 --> 20:22.556
That's why I got
the unicycle.

20:22.590 --> 20:25.190
A unicycle can't go any
faster than you can run.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.158
- I beg to differ.
- Based on what?

20:27.192 --> 20:28.960
It has a wheel.

20:28.994 --> 20:31.195
Do you even know how
to ride a unicycle?

20:31.229 --> 20:33.297
No, but I can ride a bicycle.

20:33.331 --> 20:37.233
And this is one wheel less than
that, so it's gotta be easier.

20:39.169 --> 20:42.570
I feel I've asked enough questions to not
be responsible for what is about to happen.

20:42.605 --> 20:43.938
- Where's the record button?
- Right there.

20:43.972 --> 20:45.473
On the back.

20:51.513 --> 20:54.081
There's no turning back now.

20:54.115 --> 20:56.516
OK. It's go time.

21:03.824 --> 21:06.558
He did the wrong thing.

21:08.661 --> 21:10.828
That really hurt.

21:11.362 --> 21:14.331
Max, what are you doing?

21:14.365 --> 21:15.932
Giving the people
what they want.

21:15.967 --> 21:18.835
I'm an Internet sensation.

21:18.870 --> 21:20.503
Well, knock it off!

21:21.205 --> 21:22.205
It's her.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.873
It's the "knock it off" lady.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.109
Why they calling me the
"knock it off lady?" What?

21:27.111 --> 21:29.146
We love how you
always say:

21:29.180 --> 21:31.681
"Knock it off.
Knock it off."

21:31.715 --> 21:33.815
And we love it when
you pretend to be mean.

21:33.850 --> 21:37.919
Oh, well, I'm not pretending,
but thank you.

21:37.953 --> 21:42.389
We're from the "knock it off"
lady fan club.

21:42.424 --> 21:44.358
Knock it off!

21:46.094 --> 21:49.662
Wait a minute. I'm the one
who started this whole thing.

21:49.697 --> 21:50.730
Watch!

21:59.803 --> 22:00.836
No, no, no.

22:01.037 --> 22:03.105
I'm the one who started
this whole thing.

22:03.139 --> 22:05.039
I do all the stuff she
says "knock it off" to.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.507
Knock it off!

22:06.542 --> 22:07.575
Knock it off! Knock it off!
