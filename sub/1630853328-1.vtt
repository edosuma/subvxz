20:23.397 --> 20:25.958

20:25.993 --> 20:26.825

20:29.230 --> 20:31.736

-Wait, who?

21:05.769 --> 21:07.802
-The singer from U?
-She appeared out of nowhere.

21:18.386 --> 21:19.418
Good afternoon!

21:20.014 --> 21:21.585
Hiro!

21:21.620 --> 21:23.620
Guess what happened! Bell she--

21:23.655 --> 21:27.052
I know. She made it on U's
Global Music Viral Hits Charts,

21:27.087 --> 21:28.757
just as I expected she would.

21:28.792 --> 21:30.528
No! That's not it!

21:30.563 --> 21:32.057
She's being dragged like crazy!

21:32.598 --> 21:36.369
Also as I expected. This is
typical internet behavior.

21:36.404 --> 21:40.406
Hm. If you're only getting love,
you only have hardcore fans.

21:40.441 --> 21:41.902
Not really famous.

21:41.937 --> 21:45.444
If you want real stardom in U,
you gotta expect mixed opinions.

21:45.479 --> 21:46.874
But half of them hate me!

21:46.909 --> 21:48.876
I'm so dead!

21:48.911 --> 21:50.911
So what? The other
half doesn't hate you!

21:50.946 --> 21:52.451
Don't forget that.

21:52.783 --> 21:54.552
Now what's the secret
to your success?

21:54.785 --> 21:56.048
I look like Ruka.

21:56.083 --> 21:57.621
And?

21:57.656 --> 21:59.150
People do really cool
arrangements of my songs.

21:59.185 --> 22:01.086
Um, what else?

22:01.121 --> 22:02.758
You're my producer
and the costumes,

22:02.793 --> 22:04.089
and the dances, and...

22:04.124 --> 22:07.026
No!
Well I mean yes, but no!

22:07.468 --> 22:09.798
The biggest factor
is that it's in U!

22:09.833 --> 22:11.965
With its unique body
sharing technology,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.869
U is able to draw out
a user's hidden strengths.

22:14.904 --> 22:16.640
So without it,
you wouldn't be singing at all,

22:16.675 --> 22:18.939
but instead depressed and
crying all the time, as usual.

22:18.974 --> 22:20.677
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
take a look at this.

22:21.515 --> 22:22.943
"Who is Bell?"

22:23.682 --> 22:25.484
No!

22:25.519 --> 22:27.948
It's actually kinda funny
how totally wrong they are.

22:27.983 --> 22:30.786
I mean, people are guessing
all these celebrities.

22:30.821 --> 22:33.085
Couldn't be further
from the truth.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.625
This isn't funny!

22:34.660 --> 22:35.923
Nobody in their right mind
would ever guess that

22:35.958 --> 22:38.662
Bell's user is actually
a mousy nobody like you,

22:38.697 --> 22:40.059
from some remote town.

22:42.129 --> 22:43.535
You're scary.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.636
This is more fun
than any video game.

freckled schoolgirl

22:47.508 --> 22:51.169

about them tracking you

know what happiness is.

32:34.193 --> 32:35.654
this creature must be
disposed of.

32:35.689 --> 32:36.787
Is he the leader?

32:36.822 --> 32:38.162
<i> Yeah. That's Justin.</i>

32:38.527 --> 32:39.592
Behold!

32:51.540 --> 32:53.177
This is the light of truth

32:53.212 --> 32:55.641
that protects justice
and order inside of U.

32:55.676 --> 32:57.181
And with this light,

32:57.216 --> 32:59.414
we will be able to unveil
this horrible creature!

33:01.418 --> 33:03.385
Look at all the sponsors he has!

33:03.420 --> 33:05.222
-Did he say "unveil"?
-Yeah, unveil!

33:16.103 --> 33:17.135
Close him in!

33:31.316 --> 33:33.184
End of the line, you monster.

33:33.219 --> 33:36.451
I'm going to reveal the ugly
truth about who you really are.

33:36.486 --> 33:37.683
Yeah! That's right! Do it!

33:38.852 --> 33:43.755
Justin! Justin!
Justin! Justin! Justin!

33:55.439 --> 33:56.537
Yeah! Get him!

34:05.812 --> 34:08.318
That was a jerk move!
You could've hurt Belle!

34:34.709 --> 34:37.182
It can't be...
this is impossible...

34:37.217 --> 34:37.842
How did he do that?

34:44.851 --> 34:46.686
I will unveil you,
I swear I will!

34:51.693 --> 34:54.463
Who are you? Really?

35:03.870 --> 35:05.375
Done.

35:05.410 --> 35:06.541
I'll see you after school, okay?

35:07.247 --> 35:09.445
Suzu, wanna talk dinner?

35:10.844 --> 35:11.909
Mm-mm.

35:12.681 --> 35:13.746
I can make tataki.

35:14.221 --> 35:14.846
Mm-mm.

35:15.420 --> 35:16.452
Okay then.

35:18.687 --> 35:20.390
"Belle's concert cancelled."

35:20.425 --> 35:22.194
Ugh, I feel so bad.

35:26.893 --> 35:28.596
Ow.

35:29.929 --> 35:31.434
They can't blame Belle.

35:31.469 --> 35:32.567
It's that Beast guy's fault.

35:32.602 --> 35:34.272
He deserves to be unveiled.

35:34.505 --> 35:36.769
Why does he do stuff that
will make people hate him?

35:36.804 --> 35:38.606
Oh, he probably thinks
he's being cool.

35:38.641 --> 35:40.179
There's gotta be
a better reason.

35:40.478 --> 35:41.741
He's just flexing.

35:41.776 --> 35:42.940
You think so?

35:42.975 --> 35:44.678
We should just find
out who he really is

35:44.713 --> 35:46.548
and just unveil him ourselves.

35:47.881 --> 35:50.519
Oh, hey Kamishin,
why the huge bag?

35:50.554 --> 35:51.718
I've got an away match.

35:51.753 --> 35:53.687
Woah! And I take it you do, too?

35:53.722 --> 35:55.194
You and I are nothing alike.

35:57.594 --> 36:00.760
The way it works is,
the AS is constantly in sync

36:00.795 --> 36:02.729
with the user's biometric info.

36:02.764 --> 36:03.928
It's how they prevent you

36:03.963 --> 36:05.798
-from having two avatars.
-Oh.

36:05.833 --> 36:07.767
I searched all over the internet

36:07.802 --> 36:09.637
but there's no data
about the Beast's

36:09.672 --> 36:11.672
nationality,
age or gender.

36:11.707 --> 36:13.773
All I learned was that
he suddenly appeared

36:13.808 --> 36:14.807
seven months ago.

36:14.842 --> 36:16.314
So there's no way to find them?

36:16.349 --> 36:17.513
Not the user.

36:18.010 --> 36:20.285
But I did manage to
locate the records

36:20.320 --> 36:20.945
of all his
past opponents.

36:20.980 --> 36:22.716
Okay.

36:22.751 --> 36:26.786
In total he's won 369 matches,
lost three and tied two.

36:26.821 --> 36:30.625
Lucky for us,
most of his 374 opponents

36:30.660 --> 36:32.264
have other public
social network accounts

36:32.299 --> 36:33.331
linked to their U one.

36:34.467 --> 36:35.927
<i>We should track them down,</i>
<i>talk to them,</i>

36:35.962 --> 36:37.269
<i>and see what they know.</i>

36:39.966 --> 36:42.802
"We will be using
the study room."

36:49.844 --> 36:51.976
I have a question for any
of the Beast's opponents.

36:52.011 --> 36:53.516
Who is he?

36:53.848 --> 36:56.552
-It's a mystery.
-They're definitely not AI.

36:56.818 --> 36:59.258
-Way too aggressive.
-Got a bad personality.

36:59.689 --> 37:01.722
-Why does he act out?
-I have no clue.

37:01.757 --> 37:03.856
I was one of the first
to fight them.

37:03.891 --> 37:06.056
His back didn't have quite
as many bruises then.

37:06.091 --> 37:08.058
So those are battle scars?

37:08.093 --> 37:10.962
Question for those few of you
who have beat him before.

37:11.734 --> 37:13.437
How were you able
to win the match?

37:13.736 --> 37:15.373
Out of the blue,
he threw the match.

37:15.408 --> 37:17.771
It seemed like to me
something distracted them.

37:19.071 --> 37:20.675
The Angel!

37:20.710 --> 37:21.709
Do you know something?

37:25.781 --> 37:27.011
Someone must know something!

37:27.046 --> 37:28.716
Come on, even a rumor?

37:28.751 --> 37:30.751
-<i> No clue.</i>
<i>Maybe it's this guy.</i>

37:30.786 --> 37:32.687
<i> Oh yeah, him?</i>
<i>The bruises are similar.</i>

37:32.722 --> 37:34.722
Wait, who? Huh.

37:38.431 --> 37:39.529
His name is Jellinek.

37:39.564 --> 37:41.927
He's an obscure modern artist.

37:42.831 --> 37:44.864
Six months ago,
he started getting tattoos

37:44.899 --> 37:46.470
that look like bruises.

37:46.802 --> 37:48.703
That's around the time
the Beast showed up.

37:48.738 --> 37:50.441
And since then
his artwork's value

37:50.476 --> 37:52.542
has increased twenty times.

37:52.577 --> 37:53.708
That's suspicious.

37:53.743 --> 37:55.039
Oh! His agent's contact info.

37:55.448 --> 37:56.876
We should call it!

37:56.911 --> 37:58.042
What?! Are you serious?

38:00.387 --> 38:01.485
<i>I'm not talking.</i>

38:01.520 --> 38:02.915
<i> Why the tattoos?</i>

38:02.950 --> 38:04.752
<i>Who are you anyways?</i>

38:04.787 --> 38:06.919
<i> Last night, where were</i>
<i>you and what were you doing?</i>

38:06.954 --> 38:08.789
<i> Why can't you all</i>
<i>just leave me alone?</i>

38:08.824 --> 38:10.461
-<i> Why won't you answer?</i>
<i>-I'm done talking!</i>

38:12.498 --> 38:14.465
That guy is definitely
hiding something.

38:18.471 --> 38:19.800
Okay. Who else could it be?

38:19.835 --> 38:20.933
<i> Dunno.</i>

38:20.968 --> 38:22.770
<i>But I know people like that.</i>

38:22.805 --> 38:24.068
<i> Oh, you mean</i>
<i>annoying people.</i>

38:24.103 --> 38:25.102
<i>People who are always</i>

38:25.137 --> 38:26.070
<i>claiming to be a victim.</i>

38:26.105 --> 38:27.643
<i> Oh yeah,</i>
<i>maybe it's her.</i>

38:27.843 --> 38:28.976
A woman?

38:29.011 --> 38:30.976
<i>On that day, I was</i>
<i>having a birthday party.</i>

38:31.011 --> 38:32.648
<i> Oh, happy birthday!</i>

38:32.683 --> 38:33.716
<i>No, it was for my husband.</i>

38:33.751 --> 38:35.981
<i>Let me tell you,</i>
<i>it was a lot of work</i>

38:36.016 --> 38:38.115
<i>but my daughters helped me</i>
<i>bake the cake at least.</i>

38:38.150 --> 38:40.425
<i> Yeah I'm looking at</i>
<i>your Instagram right now.</i>

38:40.460 --> 38:41.657
<i>You are?</i>

38:41.692 --> 38:42.757
<i> You have</i>
<i>such a lovely family.</i>

38:42.792 --> 38:44.462
<i>Oh, you are too kind!</i>

38:44.497 --> 38:45.793
<i>Does that mean</i>
<i>I'll make it in your</i>

38:45.828 --> 38:47.762
<i>"how to be</i>
<i>an ideal housewife" article?</i>

38:47.797 --> 38:48.930
Absolutely!

38:48.965 --> 38:52.470
I'm sure my readers would
love to hear all your tips.

38:52.505 --> 38:54.098
We'll reach out
to set it all up.

38:54.133 --> 38:56.672
She doesn't really
seem like a bad person.

38:56.872 --> 38:59.037
Are you kidding?
She was lying through her teeth.

38:59.072 --> 39:01.006
And she doesn't have a family.
And that cake's store bought.

39:01.041 --> 39:02.744
-Huh?
-The cameras outside

39:02.779 --> 39:04.713
her home
have only captured Amazon

39:04.748 --> 39:06.715
and Uber Eats deliveries
for months.

39:06.750 --> 39:08.552
And all the pictures on
her social media

39:08.587 --> 39:10.015
are actually stock photos.

39:10.050 --> 39:12.424
Like this one.
This one, and this one.

39:12.822 --> 39:14.558
I don't get it,
why would she do that?

39:14.593 --> 39:17.726
No alibi. And aggressive.

39:17.761 --> 39:20.564
Is her "They hurt me"
post about bruises?

39:21.193 --> 39:22.833
She could very well
be the Beast.

39:30.136 --> 39:32.906
Now there's a rumor going around
about superstar slugger Fox,

39:32.941 --> 39:34.677
who played in this
year's World Series.

39:34.712 --> 39:37.042
And word on the street is
that this baseball giant

39:37.077 --> 39:39.715
has been hiding a rather
dark secret for years now.

39:39.750 --> 39:41.519
-Go on.
-Well, some are claiming that

39:41.554 --> 39:43.147
he is an extremely violent man

39:43.182 --> 39:45.083
who's wearing
a gentleman's mask.

39:45.118 --> 39:47.723
And that's the reason why you
always see him so covered up,

39:47.758 --> 39:49.626
no matter what
the temperature is like outside.

39:50.090 --> 39:51.562
<i>I guess every celebrity's</i>

39:51.597 --> 39:53.564
<i>got a skeleton or two</i>
<i>in their closet.</i>

39:53.599 --> 39:55.863
<i>Wouldn't be the first time</i>
<i>we were disillusioned.</i>

39:57.867 --> 39:59.735
<i>Hello. My name is Gogo Doggo.</i>

39:59.770 --> 40:01.737
<i>Mr. Reggsignation here.</i>

40:01.772 --> 40:02.838
<i>-Have you heard yet?</i>
<i>-About what?</i>

40:02.873 --> 40:04.542
<i>There's an AS that's</i>
<i>gaining popularity</i>

40:04.577 --> 40:05.710
<i>among children right now.</i>

40:05.745 --> 40:08.040
<i>-More popular than me?!</i>
<i>-Are you popular?</i>

40:08.075 --> 40:09.448
-Serious. Genuine question.
-No. No! Who is it?!

40:10.913 --> 40:13.045
<i>The answer is, the Beast.</i>

40:13.080 --> 40:14.246
<i>I thought everybody hated him.</i>

40:14.281 --> 40:16.851
<i>His hideout is this</i>
<i>place called The Castle.</i>

40:16.886 --> 40:19.051
<i>Yeah, everybody's</i>
<i>searching U trying to find it.</i>

40:19.086 --> 40:20.558
<i>What happens</i>
<i>when they find it?</i>

40:20.593 --> 40:22.021
<i>I would take a selfie.</i>

40:22.056 --> 40:23.187
<i>I would shake their hand.</i>

40:23.222 --> 40:24.661
<i>But he's the bad guy.</i>

40:24.696 --> 40:25.829
<i>That dude doesn't talk much.</i>

40:25.864 --> 40:27.730
<i>Yeah, but I think that's</i>
<i>kinda cool though.</i>

40:27.765 --> 40:29.193
<i>Isn't he scary though?</i>

40:29.228 --> 40:31.162
<i>To me...the Beast...</i>

40:31.197 --> 40:32.768
<i>He's my hero.</i>

40:33.969 --> 40:35.001
Hero.

40:37.808 --> 40:40.204
<i>Yeah. It's been the three</i>
<i>of us for awhile now.</i>

40:40.239 --> 40:42.547
<i>It's been tough since</i>
<i>they lost their mom,</i>

40:42.582 --> 40:43.548
<i>but at least they're happy.</i>

40:44.817 --> 40:46.749
<i>We just take it day by day.</i>
<i>Enjoying the little--</i>

40:50.557 --> 40:52.084
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>The two of us go way back.</i>

40:52.691 --> 40:54.493
<i>We hit it off immediately!</i>

40:54.891 --> 40:57.056
<i>Do you even know how</i>
<i>loaded that guy is?</i>

40:57.091 --> 40:58.728
<i>Just click on the link</i>
<i>below if you wanna know</i>

40:58.763 --> 41:00.059
<i>where his mansion's located.</i>

41:01.832 --> 41:03.733
<i>Wait, what? Who's this Beast?</i>

41:03.768 --> 41:05.097
<i> No seriously, who?</i>

41:05.132 --> 41:06.769
<i>I mean really, who is he?</i>

41:06.804 --> 41:08.507
<i> Who the heck</i>
<i>do you think it is?</i>

41:14.141 --> 41:16.647
Two rice dishes
with sides, Mrs. Tsuitsui.

41:17.210 --> 41:18.715
Mmm-hmm.

41:20.118 --> 41:21.451
<i>What is wrong with you people?</i>
<i>it's not a publicity stunt.</i>

41:21.486 --> 41:24.149
<i>It was a terrible accident.</i>
<i>And I'm still in mourning.</i>

41:24.184 --> 41:26.987
<i>My art is a part of</i>
<i>my grieving process.</i>

41:27.022 --> 41:29.022
<i>I put the tattoos where</i>
<i>my lover was scarred.</i>

41:30.157 --> 41:32.795
I guess it's true that everyone
is hiding some kind of secret.

41:32.830 --> 41:34.159
You're too gullible.

41:34.194 --> 41:35.798
He's only sharing the secret

41:35.833 --> 41:37.228
in order to hide
an even bigger one.

41:37.263 --> 41:38.801
You're too skeptical.

41:38.836 --> 41:40.671
Of course I am. I have to be,

41:40.706 --> 41:42.772
if we wanna find out what
he's really trying to hide.

41:42.807 --> 41:44.675
What's wrong with secrets?
Everyone has them.

41:44.710 --> 41:46.644
-You mean like you?
-You got secrets.

41:46.679 --> 41:48.811
Who me?
I don't have any secrets.

41:48.846 --> 41:50.813
Like the wallpaper on
your phone's lock screen.

41:50.848 --> 41:52.782
Our physics teacher. Terada.

41:52.817 --> 41:53.816
Shh, shh!
Don't talk about this in public!

41:53.851 --> 41:55.114
Okay. Here.

41:55.149 --> 41:56.313
Two rice dishes.

41:57.316 --> 41:58.821
I'm nobody to him.

41:58.856 --> 42:01.021
Another face
in a sea of students.

42:02.354 --> 42:05.091
Just promise me you won't
tell my parents, okay?

42:05.126 --> 42:07.324
They still think of me as
their perfect little daughter.

42:07.359 --> 42:08.699
Your secret's safe.

42:08.899 --> 42:10.129
If my mom found out,

42:10.164 --> 42:12.032
she'd start foaming
at the mouth and die.

42:12.067 --> 42:13.165
I mean just yesterday--

42:17.710 --> 42:19.336
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

42:20.174 --> 42:21.811
Really, I am.

42:22.044 --> 42:25.012
Forget it. It's just that,
I guess I didn't realize that

42:25.047 --> 42:27.718
you actually still talk
to your parents that much.

42:27.951 --> 42:30.215
After Mom,
it's just me and my dad,

42:30.250 --> 42:32.723
but we hardly ever talk
to each other at all.

42:37.763 --> 42:40.126
I want you to know
I'll always be here for you.

42:40.931 --> 42:42.700
It's crazy how long it's been.

42:42.735 --> 42:44.163
-I'm thinking about

42:44.198 --> 42:45.703
moving back in with the folks.

42:45.738 --> 42:47.903
Now quit your moping
and eat already.

42:47.938 --> 42:49.971
Hey, can I also get two
orders in noodles, please?

42:50.006 --> 42:51.137
Sure.

43:11.456 --> 43:13.665
<i> Are you sure</i>
<i>the castle's way out here?</i>

43:13.700 --> 43:15.161
<i> I'm positive</i>
<i>I'm right this time.</i>

43:15.196 --> 43:16.998
<i> Then why don't</i>
<i>you come with me?</i>

43:17.033 --> 43:19.132
<i> Mr. Terada's teaching</i>
<i>a makeup class. Laters.</i>

43:19.167 --> 43:20.771
<i> Ugh.</i>

43:24.744 --> 43:26.106
Are you
looking for something?

43:26.812 --> 43:28.042
Who are you?

43:28.077 --> 43:30.946
I am an AI.
I know everything.

43:30.981 --> 43:32.948
I'm looking for a castle.

43:32.983 --> 43:34.147
That's what I guessed.

43:34.182 --> 43:35.687
Uh, what?

43:38.989 --> 43:40.120
What is this?

43:44.456 --> 43:45.961
Do you need help?

43:45.996 --> 43:47.391
I'm looking for a castle.

43:47.998 --> 43:49.294
I figured as much.

43:49.329 --> 43:50.867
I'll tell you, but only you.

44:02.815 --> 44:04.243
-Do you need help?

44:05.048 --> 44:06.982
You're looking for
the castle, right?

44:07.017 --> 44:09.017
I'll tell you but you
must keep it a secret.

44:10.889 --> 44:12.988
Wait! Uh, where am I?

44:13.221 --> 44:14.759
I can't see a thing.

44:16.356 --> 44:17.355
Don't listen to them.

44:17.830 --> 44:19.060
They were lying.

44:19.260 --> 44:20.864
You'll never find them
like this.

44:22.065 --> 44:22.998
Play with me instead.

44:24.166 --> 44:26.771
Come, just follow the path.

44:37.344 --> 44:39.146
Woah.

44:45.517 --> 44:47.154
Is anyone here?

44:47.189 --> 44:48.485
-Hurry!
-Oh.

45:07.407 --> 45:09.748
-Pretty.
-I grew them.

45:10.146 --> 45:11.750
They're secret roses.

45:12.082 --> 45:12.916
Secret roses?

45:14.150 --> 45:15.215
Why keep them a secret?

45:17.483 --> 45:19.824
What are you doing here?

45:23.258 --> 45:25.126
You are trespassing!

45:25.161 --> 45:26.798
No, I followed the angel.

45:27.163 --> 45:28.932
Then get out.

45:28.967 --> 45:31.462
-But--
-Get out now!

45:37.272 --> 45:38.304
Hold on.

45:39.407 --> 45:41.208
I came here because
I wanted to ask you something.

45:41.441 --> 45:42.473
Who are you really?

45:43.916 --> 45:46.114
Please, just talk to me.

45:46.149 --> 45:49.282
Leave...
or I'll bite your head off.

46:00.900 --> 46:02.559
Where are you going?

46:14.012 --> 46:15.308
Wait...

46:16.014 --> 46:17.046
Wait.

46:22.152 --> 46:22.986
Trouble?

46:24.022 --> 46:25.021
Are we in trouble?

46:25.056 --> 46:26.220
No. You don't have to worry.

46:27.520 --> 46:29.553
Everything will be okay.

46:31.227 --> 46:35.900
Which side of you
is the real you? Which?

46:42.942 --> 46:43.600
Come back!

46:45.571 --> 46:46.845
Wait!

46:57.385 --> 47:01.255
Suzu is in love.
With a bad boy, I bet.

47:01.587 --> 47:03.554
I'm not! You're wrong!
Why say that?

47:03.963 --> 47:05.061
It's written on your face.

47:06.130 --> 47:07.525
They can't resist
those bad boys.

47:07.560 --> 47:08.658
I know I couldn't.

47:08.693 --> 47:11.067
Tough on the outside,
soft inside.

47:11.102 --> 47:12.904
And you think
"I can reform him", right?

47:13.104 --> 47:15.302
-I already told you, I'm not!

47:15.337 --> 47:17.139
Why don't you give
him a present to show you care?

47:18.439 --> 47:20.208
During my senior
year of high school,

47:20.243 --> 47:22.276
I studied abroad
for a while in Ohio.

47:22.311 --> 47:24.949
And I met a guy there with
these razor sharp eyes.

47:24.984 --> 47:26.918
But he was always
all by himself.

47:26.953 --> 47:29.118
You mean like a lone wolf type?

47:29.153 --> 47:31.285
What can I say?
I found it attractive.

47:31.320 --> 47:33.551
So I decided to give him
a birthday present.

47:33.586 --> 47:35.388
So what'd you get him?

47:35.423 --> 47:37.258
-A song.
-A song?

47:37.293 --> 47:38.688
That's right, a song.

47:38.723 --> 47:41.262
I wrote him a song and
then I sang it to him.

47:41.297 --> 47:43.528
-That's so sweet.
-A love song.

47:43.563 --> 47:46.267
That's when I saw him
smile for the first time.

47:46.302 --> 47:47.433
He told me it made him happy.

47:47.468 --> 47:49.237
Did you guys go out?

47:49.272 --> 47:50.975
-No.
-Why not?

47:51.010 --> 47:52.438
He was still in eighth grade.

47:52.473 --> 47:54.110
Eighth grade?

47:54.145 --> 47:56.343
That was a twist
I didn't expect.

47:56.675 --> 47:58.543
He came to
see me off at the airport

47:58.578 --> 48:01.216
and actually cried.
It was really touching.

48:04.089 --> 48:07.156

<i>writing a love song before.</i>

What?

49:37.446 --> 49:38.775
So many texts?

49:41.318 --> 49:43.714
<i> She and Shinobu</i>
<i>were holding hands.</i>

49:43.749 --> 49:45.716
-<i> What a show off.</i>
<i>Why her?</i>

49:45.751 --> 49:46.684
<i>They're childhood friends.</i>

49:46.719 --> 49:48.092
<i> That's no excuse.</i>

49:48.127 --> 49:49.258
<i>She's so full of herself.</i>

49:50.261 --> 49:52.096
Wha...what is this?

49:55.101 --> 49:56.234
-<i> Suzu!</i>
-Hiro!

49:56.269 --> 49:58.102
<i> Did you ask</i>
<i>Shinobu out or something?</i>

49:58.137 --> 49:59.565
What? No!

49:59.600 --> 50:00.698
-<i> Did he ask you?</i>
-Of course not.

50:00.733 --> 50:02.106
<i> What was it then?</i>

50:02.141 --> 50:03.767
<i> So...our hands...</i>

50:03.802 --> 50:05.142
<i> You held hands?</i>

50:05.177 --> 50:06.770
<i>No! He just grabbed my hand.</i>

50:06.805 --> 50:09.575
<i> That's all?</i>
<i>But it's going viral.</i>

50:09.610 --> 50:11.445
<i>Guess it shows</i>
<i>how popular he is.</i>

50:11.480 --> 50:13.447
<i>'cause they're all</i>
<i>keeping tabs on him.</i>

50:13.482 --> 50:15.251
<i>But I didn't do anything!</i>

50:15.286 --> 50:17.154
<i> Well everyone's</i>
<i>getting worked up over it.</i>

50:17.189 --> 50:19.750
<i>This is clearly triggering</i>
<i>some unresolved issues.</i>

50:19.785 --> 50:22.291
<i>I mean, the pettiness,</i>
<i>the name-calling,</i>

50:22.326 --> 50:23.523
<i>not to mention the over-share.</i>

50:23.558 --> 50:24.854
<i>So tense right now.</i>

50:24.889 --> 50:26.122
<i> But I...</i>

50:26.157 --> 50:28.264
<i>I thought they were all</i>
<i>supposed to be friends.</i>

50:28.299 --> 50:29.529
<i> Guess it</i>
<i>takes real conflict</i>

50:29.564 --> 50:31.300
<i>to know who your</i>
<i>true friends are.</i>

50:31.335 --> 50:33.434
<i>This is gonna turn</i>
<i>into an all-out war</i>

50:33.469 --> 50:34.567
<i>if they continue on like this.</i>

50:34.602 --> 50:36.305
<i> What do we do?</i>

50:36.340 --> 50:38.109
<i> I'll pinpoint</i>
<i>the biggest hotheads</i>

50:38.144 --> 50:40.309
<i>to stop their rumors</i>
<i>from catching fire.</i>

50:40.344 --> 50:43.246
<i>Suzu, you go talk some sense</i>
<i>into the reasonable girls.</i>

50:43.281 --> 50:44.280
<i> I'll try!</i>

50:45.151 --> 50:46.579
<i>Listen!</i>

50:47.318 --> 50:48.317
<i>Nothing happened!</i>

50:49.485 --> 50:50.715
<i>He'd never date me!</i>

50:50.750 --> 50:52.156
<i> So true.</i>

50:52.191 --> 50:53.718
<i> We overreacted.</i>

50:53.753 --> 50:55.588
<i> Uh, can everyone</i>
<i>just like chill a little bit?</i>

51:01.266 --> 51:02.727
I'm here!

51:06.337 --> 51:08.205
Well, I managed to
put out that fire.

51:08.240 --> 51:10.504
<i> Sorry.</i>

51:10.539 --> 51:12.506
People can be so heartless.

51:12.541 --> 51:13.804
They only reacted this way

51:13.839 --> 51:15.608
'cause you're such
a gloomy wallflower.

51:15.643 --> 51:17.643
If it had been Ruka they
wouldn't have even cared

51:17.678 --> 51:19.348
and life would've
gone on as usual.

51:21.352 --> 51:23.319
Speaking of Ruka,

51:23.354 --> 51:26.652
"I know this is sudden,
but are you free to talk now?"

51:26.687 --> 51:28.390
The timing is odd.

51:28.425 --> 51:30.821
Why would she text you
right at this moment?

51:30.856 --> 51:32.361
<i> What do you mean?</i>

51:32.396 --> 51:33.857
<i> Maybe she</i>
<i>started the rumor.</i>

51:34.365 --> 51:35.760
<i> She would never do</i>
<i>something like the that.</i>

51:35.795 --> 51:38.169
<i>She must be into Shinobu.</i>

51:38.204 --> 51:41.337
She's pretty. She doesn't
need to do that to get a guy!

51:41.372 --> 51:43.537
I really can't stand
girls who act this way.

51:43.572 --> 51:45.209
<i> She probably</i>
<i>wants my opinion</i>

51:45.244 --> 51:46.644
<i>'cause we grew up together.</i>

51:46.679 --> 51:48.674
<i> I would ignore her, but</i>
<i>then again, I'm not that nice.</i>

51:54.220 --> 51:55.384
What do I do?

52:08.432 --> 52:10.597
Kamishin's really committed.

52:10.632 --> 52:11.730
Yeah. He sure is.

52:16.440 --> 52:18.407
-Shinobu!
-I've been here for forever,

52:18.442 --> 52:19.738
just waiting for
him to wrap it up.

52:23.909 --> 52:25.876
Hey, did something happen today?

52:28.287 --> 52:29.352
You can tell me.

52:32.720 --> 52:34.885
Well, actually there's something

52:34.920 --> 52:37.525
I've been meaning to ask you
for kind of a while now.

52:38.462 --> 52:39.692
Okay.

52:39.727 --> 52:44.301
You see...well, it's, um...

52:46.305 --> 52:47.601
I...

52:47.636 --> 52:49.735
Hey, Suzu!
You headed home?

52:49.770 --> 52:51.209
I just finished
my practice laps.

52:51.409 --> 52:53.211
Whew, I'm so wiped out.

52:54.313 --> 52:55.444
Uh what's going on?

52:56.547 --> 52:59.745
Uh Kamishin, uh yeah,
how did that away match go?

52:59.780 --> 53:01.615
Oh right!
Well, I went and competed.

53:01.650 --> 53:03.386
But then guess what happened?

53:03.718 --> 53:05.487
Okay. So I like,
traveled all this way.

53:05.522 --> 53:07.390
Even took a bus overnight

53:07.425 --> 53:09.359
'cause there's this recruiter
there I really wanted to impress

53:09.394 --> 53:11.328
from this college
I had my eye on,

53:11.363 --> 53:13.462
but I was way off my game and
got one of my worst times.

53:13.497 --> 53:14.529
Oh, yeah.

53:15.829 --> 53:17.235
Do you want to see a pic?

53:17.501 --> 53:18.665
I guess it could've been worse.

53:18.997 --> 53:20.502
I do feel guilty though.

53:20.537 --> 53:22.339
You know, for the guys
who didn't make nationals,

53:22.968 --> 53:25.276
You mean, you qualified
for the nationals?

53:25.311 --> 53:27.344
I did.

53:27.544 --> 53:30.479
Seriously?
That is so awesome!

53:30.514 --> 53:31.909
I'm rooting for you!

53:31.944 --> 53:33.009
You are?

53:34.947 --> 53:36.353
-Shinobu?
-Huh?

53:36.388 --> 53:38.487
If she said she's going
to root for me then,

53:38.819 --> 53:39.917
does that mean...

53:39.952 --> 53:40.984
-What?

53:42.087 --> 53:44.526
Is this your way of telling
me you like me, Suzu?

53:46.695 --> 53:48.695
Oh. Guess that's a no then?

53:48.730 --> 53:50.026
That's what your
silence means, right?

53:50.699 --> 53:51.929
Go put your stuff away already.

53:51.964 --> 53:54.063
I was kidding, of course.

53:54.098 --> 53:56.406
See ya later, Suzu.
Thanks for your support.

53:56.837 --> 53:58.540
-Just hurry it up.
-Yeah, yeah.

54:09.047 --> 54:12.048
So uh...what was it
you wanted to tell me, earlier?

54:13.425 --> 54:15.359
-Nothing.
-Did you forget?

54:15.394 --> 54:16.558
It's no big deal.

54:16.593 --> 54:18.659
-You sure?
-I'm sure.

54:25.998 --> 54:27.470
Listen...

54:28.706 --> 54:31.408
you don't have to waste your
time worrying about me anymore.

54:32.070 --> 54:32.904
Huh?

54:34.380 --> 54:35.610
Suzu!

54:39.583 --> 54:41.451
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

55:48.883 --> 55:49.849
Who's that?

56:06.505 --> 56:07.537
Bruises.

56:12.544 --> 56:13.906
Get away.

56:13.941 --> 56:15.138
I'm sorry, but your
bruises...they're...

56:15.173 --> 56:17.173
You think they're ugly?
Is that it?

56:17.208 --> 56:21.551
No! Are they painful?
I'm sure they are. I just--

56:21.586 --> 56:23.179
You have no clue about anything.

56:23.720 --> 56:25.555
Then why don't you
explain it to me?

56:25.590 --> 56:29.526
Get out of here!

56:51.715 --> 56:52.747
-You there!

56:55.246 --> 56:56.784
What are you doing over here?

56:57.050 --> 56:58.181
Were you meeting
with someone?

56:58.216 --> 57:00.491
For example,
an ugly monster?

57:08.094 --> 57:09.126
Hold on.

57:09.601 --> 57:10.633
You're Belle.

57:11.130 --> 57:12.866
Why are you here?

57:13.968 --> 57:15.803
Do you refuse to answer?

57:16.267 --> 57:17.475
All right.

57:18.038 --> 57:19.807
-Then tell me this...

57:19.842 --> 57:21.611
What is your true identity?

57:27.212 --> 57:28.211
There!

57:28.246 --> 57:29.553
It's him!

57:29.588 --> 57:30.818
Let's get him.

57:44.801 --> 57:46.636
-Look, he's scared.
-What a wimp.

57:59.849 --> 58:02.047
We're gonna crash!

58:09.727 --> 58:11.694
Where did
that monster go? Where?

58:13.027 --> 58:14.158
Damn it.

58:23.169 --> 58:24.201
Stay back.

58:25.875 --> 58:27.611
Leave me alone.

58:43.354 --> 58:46.861
I think that I know you
a little better now.

58:49.899 --> 58:52.768
This is where it
really hurts, isn't it?

58:54.706 --> 58:56.871
You saved me back there.
Thank you.

58:59.711 --> 59:00.941
Belle.

Don't...look at me.

1:03:55.237 --> 1:03:57.303
"Isn't Belle doing
another concert?"

1:03:57.338 --> 1:03:59.008
"Why won't she sing?"

1:04:00.044 --> 1:04:02.077
This one says,
"She must be afraid.

1:04:02.112 --> 1:04:03.980
It's because of the Beast.

1:04:04.015 --> 1:04:05.575
Someone should unveil him."

1:04:05.610 --> 1:04:07.247
I'm gonna leave him alone.

1:04:07.953 --> 1:04:10.613
Why do we need to know
his secret anyway?

1:04:10.648 --> 1:04:12.087
It's not up to us, though.

1:04:13.223 --> 1:04:14.892
U isn't like a small group
text from class, you know.

1:04:16.159 --> 1:04:17.620
Nobody can stop it.

1:04:18.656 --> 1:04:20.931
<i> The AS commonly</i>
<i>referred to as the Beast</i>

1:04:20.966 --> 1:04:22.526
<i>threatens order in U.</i>

1:04:22.561 --> 1:04:24.363
<i>Contact us</i>
<i>with any information</i>

1:04:24.398 --> 1:04:26.662
<i>with the hashtag</i>
<i>#UnveilTheBeast.</i>

1:04:27.137 --> 1:04:29.269
<i>What do you wanna bet</i>
<i>he's some old shut in?</i>

1:04:29.304 --> 1:04:31.942
<i> They're like some</i>
<i>young gaming prodigy.</i>

1:04:31.977 --> 1:04:34.340
<i> He's a she and</i>
<i>a really sexy one too.</i>

1:04:34.606 --> 1:04:36.408
<i> I heard that</i>
<i>it's a billionaire.</i>

1:04:36.443 --> 1:04:37.709
<i> Once they're unveiled,</i>

1:04:37.745 --> 1:04:40.082
<i>I'm suing them for mental</i>
<i>distress from our match.</i>

1:04:40.117 --> 1:04:42.579
Jellinek, who is this?
Is this your new girlfriend?

1:04:42.614 --> 1:04:45.219
<i>-He is amazing.</i>
<i>-Look, I'm not dead, okay?</i>

1:04:45.254 --> 1:04:46.957
<i>Oh, wait, she isn't?</i>

1:04:46.992 --> 1:04:48.959
<i>I never said it was my</i>
<i>girlfriend who I was mourning.</i>

1:04:48.994 --> 1:04:50.620
<i>Those tattoos were</i>
<i>to copy the Beast.</i>

1:04:50.655 --> 1:04:52.160
<i>All of his art is plagiarized.</i>

1:04:52.426 --> 1:04:54.129
<i>All she does is lie!</i>

1:04:54.164 --> 1:04:55.592
<i>He's a con artist!</i>

1:04:55.627 --> 1:04:56.725
<i>That loser</i>
<i>should just shut up.</i>

1:04:56.760 --> 1:04:59.200
<i>-Excuse me?</i>
<i>-Plagiarize?</i>

1:04:59.235 --> 1:05:00.135
<i>I would never do that.</i>

1:05:01.071 --> 1:05:02.698
I wanted to address
the rumors out there

1:05:02.733 --> 1:05:06.009
that I'm harboring a secret
because I don't show my skin.

1:05:06.044 --> 1:05:08.671
Why, just the other day, someone
in U was causing a scene,

1:05:08.706 --> 1:05:11.047
accusing me of secretly
being the Beast.

1:05:11.082 --> 1:05:13.181
But there isn't anything
villainous about me,

1:05:13.216 --> 1:05:15.183
nor am I a violent man.

1:05:15.218 --> 1:05:17.988
Now, it's always been important
for me to be a role model

1:05:18.023 --> 1:05:19.055
and hero to the children.

1:05:26.064 --> 1:05:28.064
I hope this isn't too shocking.

1:05:28.099 --> 1:05:30.495
When I was little,
I had a lot of medical issues

1:05:30.530 --> 1:05:33.465
and because of that, I needed
several major surgeries,

1:05:33.500 --> 1:05:35.071
<i>but I overcame these obstacles</i>

1:05:35.106 --> 1:05:37.073
<i>and still managed</i>
<i>to play baseball.</i>

1:05:37.108 --> 1:05:39.075
<i>So to all you kids</i>
<i>watching out there,</i>

1:05:39.110 --> 1:05:41.506
<i>don't give up and</i>
<i>keep following your dream.</i>

1:05:41.541 --> 1:05:42.507
<i>I hope you'll</i>
<i>receive this message</i>

1:05:42.542 --> 1:05:44.146
<i>the way I sincerely</i>
<i>intended it.</i>

1:05:47.448 --> 1:05:49.316
So then who's the Beast?

1:05:49.351 --> 1:05:51.054
-Unacceptable!
-Huh?

1:05:51.089 --> 1:05:53.056
Absolutely unacceptable!

1:05:53.091 --> 1:05:56.323
I refuse to forgive
anybody who hurts me.

1:05:57.392 --> 1:06:00.492
Wait, are you that
housewife I interviewed?

1:06:00.527 --> 1:06:02.527
-Huh?
-Why are you a baby?

1:06:02.562 --> 1:06:05.728
Uh, must be because I have such
an innocent and pure heart.

1:06:05.763 --> 1:06:07.268
Oh, you wish.

1:06:07.303 --> 1:06:09.138
You think if you act all cutesy,

1:06:09.173 --> 1:06:11.107
then you can get
anything you want.

1:06:12.407 --> 1:06:14.143
-Shut up!

1:06:14.178 --> 1:06:16.112
This is emotional abuse!

1:06:16.741 --> 1:06:18.246
<i> Is it true</i>
<i>Belle's gonna sing again?</i>

1:06:19.381 --> 1:06:21.117
<i> It's just a rumor.</i>

1:06:21.152 --> 1:06:22.283
<i> I heard it will be</i>
<i>an impromptu show.</i>

1:06:22.318 --> 1:06:23.383
<i> That can't be true.</i>

1:06:24.089 --> 1:06:25.616
<i> But what if it is?</i>

1:06:37.696 --> 1:06:39.663
Hey, wait, where did Belle go?

1:06:39.698 --> 1:06:41.764
Belle?
Belle?

1:06:43.768 --> 1:06:45.570
Do you understand
why this light

1:06:45.605 --> 1:06:47.737
represents the power of justice?

1:06:49.279 --> 1:06:50.245
Well, do you?

1:06:51.446 --> 1:06:54.084
Normally, the biometric
information scanned by

1:06:54.119 --> 1:06:55.778
your U device is converted
to the AS through

1:06:55.813 --> 1:06:57.450
a specialized process.

1:06:58.783 --> 1:07:01.817
But this light I carry
invalidates the conversion.

1:07:01.852 --> 1:07:04.721
Exposing the user,
projecting them here in U.

1:07:05.625 --> 1:07:07.691
This is how "unveil" works.

1:07:08.595 --> 1:07:10.793
It means that I,
single-handedly,

1:07:10.828 --> 1:07:14.302
have the same power that only
the Voices, U's creators, have.

1:07:16.207 --> 1:07:18.636
Have you ever wondered why
I was given such power?

1:07:19.540 --> 1:07:21.837
Or wondered why there are
no police for the Internet?

1:07:23.511 --> 1:07:25.643
Why is it that there's
no law enforcement in U

1:07:25.678 --> 1:07:27.711
when it's so much
like the real world?

1:07:29.187 --> 1:07:30.516
It's a good question.

1:07:31.222 --> 1:07:32.848
And everybody
wants the answer.

1:07:33.653 --> 1:07:35.686
But the Voice insist
we already have

1:07:35.721 --> 1:07:37.820
everything we need to
maintain a fair society.

1:07:38.856 --> 1:07:40.823
But that is where
our perspectives differ.

1:07:40.858 --> 1:07:43.166
And every society
has its villains:

1:07:43.201 --> 1:07:45.630
those who like to cause trouble
and disrupt the order of things.

1:07:45.665 --> 1:07:47.203
But they just do as they please

1:07:47.238 --> 1:07:48.831
while scoffing at
the rest of the world.

1:07:48.866 --> 1:07:51.669
We need the ability to
fight these scoundrels.

1:07:51.704 --> 1:07:53.770
Justice is necessary,
no matter where we are.

1:07:53.805 --> 1:07:56.311
In order to destroy evil,
you need power.

1:07:56.346 --> 1:07:57.609
And that power
belongs to us!

1:07:59.184 --> 1:08:00.678
The Beast...

1:08:00.713 --> 1:08:02.878
The ugly Beast...

1:08:02.913 --> 1:08:06.354
He must be unveiled in order
to maintain the integrity of U.

1:08:07.291 --> 1:08:08.785
However, that said...

1:08:09.755 --> 1:08:12.591
Why is it you are
always with the Beast?

1:08:12.890 --> 1:08:14.164
I'm not.

1:08:14.496 --> 1:08:16.199
Tell me where he is right now

1:08:16.234 --> 1:08:18.399
or you will face
the consequences.

1:08:18.434 --> 1:08:20.896
This is your last chance
to answer me.

1:08:21.602 --> 1:08:24.372
I will unveil you right here
and now if you don't.

1:08:29.313 --> 1:08:30.774
I wouldn't tell you
even if I knew.

1:08:31.414 --> 1:08:32.545
-What?
-You don't care about

1:08:32.580 --> 1:08:34.217
maintaining justice,

1:08:34.252 --> 1:08:35.680
you just want to
control people.

1:08:35.715 --> 1:08:37.451
So I'm not telling you.

1:08:42.326 --> 1:08:43.622
Now you listen to me!

1:08:43.657 --> 1:08:46.262
I am not going to let you
make a fool of me anymore.

1:08:46.297 --> 1:08:48.429
If you think I won't unveil you,
you're sorely mistaken.

1:08:48.695 --> 1:08:50.398
So why don't we take a peek?

1:08:50.433 --> 1:08:52.367
I'm sure people would love
to know who's behind

1:08:52.402 --> 1:08:53.830
the world-famous diva.

1:08:53.865 --> 1:08:55.601
What the true face
hiding underneath

1:08:55.636 --> 1:08:57.339
the beautiful mask
looks like.

1:08:57.374 --> 1:08:59.704
I have a feeling it's nothing
like the one you wear in here.

1:08:59.739 --> 1:09:01.805
Is it?

1:09:02.346 --> 1:09:03.642
When the truth is revealed...

1:09:04.007 --> 1:09:05.974
what do you want to bet
no one will want to

1:09:06.009 --> 1:09:08.581
pay any attention to a single
one of your songs anymore?

1:09:08.616 --> 1:09:09.714
Huh?

1:09:09.749 --> 1:09:11.518
So if you don't
want that to happen,

1:09:11.553 --> 1:09:14.290
tell me where he is and
tell me who he is right now!

1:09:14.325 --> 1:09:15.423
Are you looking for something?

1:09:15.458 --> 1:09:16.754
Huh?

1:09:16.789 --> 1:09:18.294
I'll tell you, but only you.

1:09:18.329 --> 1:09:19.592
What's going on?

1:09:19.627 --> 1:09:22.298
Don't tell anybody else, okay?

1:09:24.632 --> 1:09:26.302
-Be gone!

1:09:34.840 --> 1:09:35.938
-You!

1:09:58.963 --> 1:10:00.666
-Thank you for saving me.

1:10:00.965 --> 1:10:02.437
I'm so glad you're okay.

1:10:07.411 --> 1:10:08.278
<i> He's in danger.</i>

1:10:09.974 --> 1:10:11.347
<i>I can't abandon him.</i>

1:10:13.516 --> 1:10:14.944
<i>I have to help him.</i>

1:10:14.979 --> 1:10:15.978
Suzu.

1:10:20.391 --> 1:10:22.325
Yeah, what?

1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:23.953
You know, if you're ever in
some kind of trouble, you can--

1:10:23.988 --> 1:10:26.758
-I'm not.
-I'm here if you are.

1:10:26.793 --> 1:10:27.957
Everything is good.

1:10:44.514 --> 1:10:45.678
Suzu.

1:10:47.385 --> 1:10:48.648
Oh.

1:10:49.486 --> 1:10:50.518
Hey, Ruka.

1:10:54.524 --> 1:10:56.491
<i> So, I bailed.</i>

1:10:57.527 --> 1:11:00.462
Your support gave me the courage
to at least go talk to him.

1:11:01.399 --> 1:11:04.598
But when I was actually
in front of him, I just froze.

1:11:05.095 --> 1:11:06.194
Hm-mm.

1:11:06.833 --> 1:11:09.702
He looked at me and said,
"What's wrong with you?

1:11:09.737 --> 1:11:11.033
You're creeping me out."

1:11:11.068 --> 1:11:12.606
You're kidding!

1:11:12.641 --> 1:11:14.377
But you can't really blame him.

1:11:14.412 --> 1:11:15.708
It's my fault.

1:11:15.743 --> 1:11:18.414
I was so insecure and
awkward, I was being creepy.

1:11:18.449 --> 1:11:19.679
No, I don't believe it.

1:11:19.714 --> 1:11:21.010
There's no way you
could have been.

1:11:21.045 --> 1:11:23.012
Oh, Shinobu's such a jerk!

1:11:23.047 --> 1:11:24.519
Oh, no, no, no, it wasn't him.

1:11:24.554 --> 1:11:25.685
If not him then...

1:11:26.721 --> 1:11:28.017
It's Chikami, yeah.

1:11:28.558 --> 1:11:29.722
Chikami?

1:11:30.054 --> 1:11:31.724
Chikami Shinjiro.

1:11:32.727 --> 1:11:33.858
You mean Kamishin?

1:11:40.031 --> 1:11:41.536
You're so cute!

1:11:44.035 --> 1:11:45.705
-It's nice.
-Good.

1:11:46.169 --> 1:11:47.773
Know what?

1:11:47.808 --> 1:11:49.544
I think I figured out
who it is you like, Suzu.

1:11:49.579 --> 1:11:50.941
Don't say it.
I'll die of embarrassment.

1:11:51.581 --> 1:11:53.416
So uh, when'd it start?

1:11:57.554 --> 1:12:00.819
When we were six,
he said, "I'll protect you."

1:12:01.624 --> 1:12:04.988
And my kid brain thought it
was like a love confession.

1:12:05.628 --> 1:12:08.662
But what he meant was that
he'd protect me from bullies.

1:12:09.863 --> 1:12:12.369
He didn't mean anything
more than that, of course.

1:12:13.636 --> 1:12:16.670
After my mom died,
I was always crying

1:12:16.705 --> 1:12:19.101
and most of my
classmates avoided me.

1:12:19.136 --> 1:12:21.939
He probably assumed I was
being bullied or something.

1:12:22.546 --> 1:12:23.677
You know?

1:12:28.651 --> 1:12:29.947
So this might sound
a little bit weird,

1:12:29.982 --> 1:12:31.487
but I've often thought

1:12:31.522 --> 1:12:33.621
that the way he's
constantly watching over you

1:12:33.656 --> 1:12:36.151
and worrying about
you is like mothering.

1:12:36.186 --> 1:12:37.185
-You think?
-Yeah.

1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:38.626
When it comes to you,

1:12:38.661 --> 1:12:40.463
he stresses over
every little thing

1:12:40.498 --> 1:12:41.992
and is always
checking up on you.

1:12:42.632 --> 1:12:44.929
Shinobu just isn't like
other high school guys.

1:12:45.503 --> 1:12:47.668
I said his name!

1:12:50.673 --> 1:12:52.134
Ah, I'm dead.

1:12:55.843 --> 1:12:57.106
I'd love to see
that elementary school

1:12:57.141 --> 1:12:58.481
you two went to.

1:12:59.649 --> 1:13:01.077
-Let's do this again.
-Mm-hm.

1:13:04.621 --> 1:13:06.016
Kamishin?

1:13:06.051 --> 1:13:07.721
You're here?

1:13:15.192 --> 1:13:16.895
Oh!

1:13:16.930 --> 1:13:18.864
I'm rooting for you.

1:13:19.603 --> 1:13:21.834
-Who, me?
-Yes, you, you're great.

1:13:23.035 --> 1:13:23.869
Is it true?

1:13:27.941 --> 1:13:30.777
If she says she believes in me,
then does that mean...

1:13:31.912 --> 1:13:34.451
Are you trying to tell me
that you have a crush on me?

1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:37.685
No, wait, I was only kidding.

1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:38.884
It was a joke, it was a joke.

1:13:41.592 --> 1:13:42.624
What?

1:13:55.232 --> 1:13:57.199
No, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

1:13:57.234 --> 1:13:58.739
Why are you running away?

1:13:58.774 --> 1:14:00.070
No girl's ever
said they liked me before.

1:14:00.105 --> 1:14:01.742
She just said
she believes in you though.

1:14:01.777 --> 1:14:02.908
Good point.

1:14:02.943 --> 1:14:04.844
So, doesn't
that make you happy?

1:14:05.143 --> 1:14:06.681
It does.

1:14:17.254 --> 1:14:19.793
I...I...

1:14:22.864 --> 1:14:26.096
-Where are you going?

1:14:26.131 --> 1:14:27.570
I don't
know what to say.

1:14:27.605 --> 1:14:29.264
Well, just say anything,

1:14:29.299 --> 1:14:31.640
like "thank you" or
"I'll do my best."

1:14:41.652 --> 1:14:42.651
Ruka?

1:14:43.181 --> 1:14:44.279
-Yes?
-Uh...

1:14:45.018 --> 1:14:46.589
What kind of stuff do you like?

1:14:46.624 --> 1:14:48.591
Music. What about you?

1:14:48.626 --> 1:14:49.658
What do you like?

1:14:51.255 --> 1:14:52.562
I like Belle.

1:14:52.597 --> 1:14:53.926
You like her?
I like her too.

1:14:54.324 --> 1:14:55.224
Really?

1:14:55.259 --> 1:14:56.764
That's so cool.

1:14:56.799 --> 1:14:58.766
I'd give anything
to sing like her.

1:14:58.801 --> 1:15:00.603
You probably won't believe this,

1:15:00.638 --> 1:15:02.605
but like people told me
that I look like her.

1:15:03.674 --> 1:15:05.036
I totally see it.

1:15:05.335 --> 1:15:06.708
You're just saying that.

1:15:07.271 --> 1:15:08.644
I'm telling the truth.

1:15:08.679 --> 1:15:10.173
You look a lot like her.

1:15:10.208 --> 1:15:12.043
Hold up.
Are you related?

1:15:13.948 --> 1:15:16.718
You know, my family goes
to Hakodate every summer

1:15:16.753 --> 1:15:18.885
so we can visit my grandfather.

1:15:19.283 --> 1:15:21.888
Which means if you
wouldn't mind it,

1:15:21.923 --> 1:15:23.890
I could watch you
compete in nationals?

1:15:25.729 --> 1:15:27.696
If you would come
to cheer me on,

1:15:29.029 --> 1:15:30.325
then I would definitely win.

1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:31.601
I know.

1:15:32.197 --> 1:15:33.328
Mm-hm.

1:15:36.234 --> 1:15:38.333
That was close.

1:15:38.940 --> 1:15:40.940
I hope it works
out for those two.

1:15:41.206 --> 1:15:42.205
Suzu.

1:15:44.682 --> 1:15:46.077
-Seen Kamishin?
-Mm-hm.

1:15:46.882 --> 1:15:48.244
-Mm-mm.
-Which is it?

1:15:48.884 --> 1:15:50.147
Mm-hm. Mm-mm.

1:15:50.380 --> 1:15:51.918
Which one?

1:15:58.190 --> 1:15:59.794
Suzu, listen.

1:16:00.390 --> 1:16:02.698
There's something I really
wanted to talk to you about.

1:16:03.965 --> 1:16:05.327
Suzu, I--

1:16:05.362 --> 1:16:06.933
Wait, wait, wait, I'm sorry.

1:16:06.968 --> 1:16:08.704
Me too. I mean, I also
have something to tell you

1:16:08.739 --> 1:16:10.068
if that's all right.

1:16:10.103 --> 1:16:10.937
Okay.

1:16:11.368 --> 1:16:13.236
It's that I, uh...

1:16:13.678 --> 1:16:16.239
-I already know.
-So the thing is, I'm--

1:16:16.274 --> 1:16:17.977
Suzu. You're Belle, right?

1:16:19.816 --> 1:16:22.080
In U, you're Belle, am I right?

1:16:25.415 --> 1:16:26.689
Suzu?

1:16:27.450 --> 1:16:28.757
You're wrong!

1:16:28.792 --> 1:16:29.791
-What?

1:16:29.826 --> 1:16:30.858
It's not true!

1:16:33.962 --> 1:16:34.961
Huh?

1:16:35.964 --> 1:16:38.096
Suzu, where'd you go?

1:16:38.131 --> 1:16:39.163
Suzu!

1:16:43.939 --> 1:16:45.675
What do I do now?

1:16:47.943 --> 1:16:49.811
How will I ever tell him?

1:16:54.785 --> 1:16:55.883
-Huh?
<i>Suzu,</i>

1:16:55.918 --> 1:16:56.917
<i>the Beast is in trouble!</i>

1:17:06.863 --> 1:17:07.994
<i> His castle...</i>

1:17:08.029 --> 1:17:09.127
Finally.

1:17:09.162 --> 1:17:09.963
They actually found it?

1:17:15.740 --> 1:17:18.037
We will show him no mercy.

1:17:18.072 --> 1:17:20.908
We'll unveil the Beast and
reveal their true identity.

1:17:23.407 --> 1:17:25.880
Today, in front of
everyone in U,

1:17:25.915 --> 1:17:27.717
we shall make him
pay for all his sins!

1:17:32.922 --> 1:17:34.724
They're finally
going to unveil the Beast.

1:17:34.990 --> 1:17:36.792
Wow,
who do you think it is?

1:17:36.827 --> 1:17:38.156
That's the big question.

1:17:38.191 --> 1:17:40.730
I heard a rumor
that he's a psycho killer.

1:17:40.765 --> 1:17:43.326
I heard a crooked
businessman who evades taxes.

1:17:45.528 --> 1:17:46.967
<i> The Beast is</i>
<i>a waste of space.</i>

1:17:47.002 --> 1:17:48.166
<i> Who needs him?</i>

1:17:48.201 --> 1:17:49.332
<i>I, for one, won't miss him.</i>

1:17:49.367 --> 1:17:50.740
<i>He deserves to be hunted!</i>

1:17:50.775 --> 1:17:51.874
<i>Hey, Beast, you watching this?</i>

1:17:51.910 --> 1:17:53.501
<i>-No way. I doubt it.</i>
<i>-All the kids around</i>

1:17:53.536 --> 1:17:55.712
<i>the world, they're out there</i>
<i>cheering you on,</i>

1:17:55.912 --> 1:17:57.978
<i>and lemme guess,</i>
<i>you're not watching, are ya?</i>

1:17:58.013 --> 1:18:00.442
<i>The Beast is being bullied</i>
<i>by the adults!</i>

1:18:00.477 --> 1:18:02.048
<i>I feel so bad.</i>

1:18:02.083 --> 1:18:03.951
<i>Someone should</i>
<i>help him now!</i>

1:18:03.986 --> 1:18:05.788
<i>Everyone, let's show</i>
<i>the Beast we care!</i>

1:18:05.823 --> 1:18:07.416
<i>What are you doing? Help him!</i>

1:18:07.451 --> 1:18:09.990
<i>Cheer the Beast on.</i>

1:18:10.421 --> 1:18:11.827
<i>Look at these idiots.</i>

1:18:13.096 --> 1:18:15.259
<i>Their viewer counts are</i>
<i>only in the single digits.</i>

1:18:15.294 --> 1:18:17.294
<i>They got like zero clout.</i>

1:18:17.329 --> 1:18:19.098
<i>-They're just try-hards.</i>
<i>-Wannabes!</i>

1:18:19.804 --> 1:18:21.067
<i>Meet me at the old school.</i>

1:18:21.102 --> 1:18:22.365
Okay.

1:18:43.289 --> 1:18:44.420
What happened?

1:18:45.324 --> 1:18:48.259
Please, protect our master.

1:18:48.492 --> 1:18:49.799
You have to.

1:18:55.466 --> 1:18:57.433
When they refused to tell us
where the Beast is,

1:18:57.468 --> 1:18:58.874
these are the consequences.

1:18:58.909 --> 1:18:59.908
You're cruel.

1:18:59.943 --> 1:19:01.041
How could you?

1:19:01.340 --> 1:19:03.142
What do I care?
They're just AI.

1:19:05.014 --> 1:19:06.178
I couldn't find him.

1:19:06.213 --> 1:19:07.916
It's fine. Let's go.

1:19:08.182 --> 1:19:09.918
We'll just burn down
this castle.

1:19:11.053 --> 1:19:13.020
What do you want to bet
that he'll come scurrying out

1:19:13.055 --> 1:19:15.858
like the vermin he truly is?

1:19:17.323 --> 1:19:19.554
Behind you, look.

1:19:20.392 --> 1:19:23.327
I'll tell you, but only...

1:19:45.351 --> 1:19:47.153
It'll be okay. Stay calm.

1:19:47.188 --> 1:19:49.188
Hang in there. Don't worry.

1:19:49.223 --> 1:19:50.926
We'll leave together.

1:19:50.961 --> 1:19:52.994
Everything is going to be fine.

1:19:53.656 --> 1:19:55.326
I just have to endure this.

1:19:55.658 --> 1:19:56.866
Endure?

1:19:57.495 --> 1:20:00.496
Belle, I can't
tell you the truth.

1:20:01.037 --> 1:20:01.838
Sorry.

1:20:02.401 --> 1:20:04.467
Wait! Don't go!

1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:38.039
Hey, Shinobu.

1:20:38.074 --> 1:20:39.469
-Have you seen this yet?
-Hm?

1:20:40.175 --> 1:20:41.603
Some crazy stuff's
going down in U.

1:20:43.948 --> 1:20:46.476
-Suzu.
-Suzu?

1:20:46.511 --> 1:20:48.313
Do you have any
idea where she went?

1:20:48.348 --> 1:20:49.512
No.

1:20:49.547 --> 1:20:51.316
Well, we were
just talking earlier

1:20:51.351 --> 1:20:53.516
and she said something about
your old elementary school.

1:20:54.189 --> 1:20:55.023
Is that near here?

1:20:58.325 --> 1:21:00.127
Uh, Shinobu?

1:21:01.130 --> 1:21:02.932
Wha--Ruka, wait! Uh...

1:21:05.002 --> 1:21:06.199
Suzu, you're late.

1:21:06.564 --> 1:21:07.563
Sorry.

1:21:08.005 --> 1:21:09.235
I'm currently
auto-searching

1:21:09.270 --> 1:21:10.599
anything that might be related.

1:21:11.835 --> 1:21:14.273
We have to find his identity
before Justin figures it out.

1:21:14.308 --> 1:21:15.140
How will we do that?

1:21:15.606 --> 1:21:17.078
How are we supposed
to find one person

1:21:17.113 --> 1:21:18.541
out of five billion accounts?

1:21:18.576 --> 1:21:20.609
-It's impossible.
-Where is he?

1:21:20.644 --> 1:21:22.413
Hey, where did he go?

1:21:23.581 --> 1:21:24.987
Where are you?

1:21:25.451 --> 1:21:26.923
Did anyone see him?

1:21:27.255 --> 1:21:28.551
Look, it's Belle!

1:21:28.586 --> 1:21:29.959
-It's Belle?
-Seriously?

1:21:29.994 --> 1:21:31.092
I knew she'd come back.

1:21:33.129 --> 1:21:34.227
No, stop!

1:21:34.262 --> 1:21:35.965
I'm looking for someone.

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.560
Let me go, please!

1:21:41.104 --> 1:21:42.235
Belle's gonna sing again!

1:21:42.270 --> 1:21:44.600
The rumor
was true, she's back!

1:21:44.635 --> 1:21:45.975
Belle, we've
been waiting for you.

1:21:46.010 --> 1:21:47.537
I wanna hear Belle sing!

1:21:47.572 --> 1:21:49.077
Sing for us,
sing already!

1:21:49.112 --> 1:21:50.947
Everyone,
we're running out of time!

1:21:51.279 --> 1:21:53.081
You need to let Belle go now!

1:21:53.116 --> 1:21:54.280
She's surrounded.

1:21:54.315 --> 1:21:55.545
This is bad.

1:21:55.580 --> 1:21:57.415
But if we go now,
then she'll figure out--

1:21:57.450 --> 1:21:59.087
That we knew this entire time.

1:21:59.122 --> 1:22:01.683
However, we should still go.

1:22:04.523 --> 1:22:06.391
I'm begging you, let Belle go!

1:22:07.328 --> 1:22:09.229
<i> Come on, think.</i>

1:22:09.264 --> 1:22:10.659
<i>Who could it be?</i>

1:22:11.068 --> 1:22:12.331
<i>Who is he, really?</i>

1:22:12.366 --> 1:22:13.695
Emotional abuse!

1:22:14.269 --> 1:22:16.005
<i> Is he like that woman?</i>

1:22:16.370 --> 1:22:17.974
<i>Is he lonely,</i>
<i>like she is?</i>

1:22:19.670 --> 1:22:20.669
<i>Then again...</i>

1:22:22.475 --> 1:22:24.673
<i> I put the tattoos</i>
<i>where my lover was scarred.</i>

1:22:27.051 --> 1:22:29.579
<i> But his bruises</i>
<i>are real, not art.</i>

1:22:33.057 --> 1:22:35.156
When I was little,
I had a lot of medical issues--

1:22:35.191 --> 1:22:37.488
<i> And they didn't seem</i>
<i>like surgical scars either.</i>

1:22:38.524 --> 1:22:41.426
<i>If the U device scanned him</i>
<i>for traces of physical pain,</i>

1:22:41.461 --> 1:22:43.659
<i>then...then his real body</i>

1:22:43.694 --> 1:22:45.166
<i>might also</i>
<i>be covered in bruises.</i>

1:22:45.729 --> 1:22:49.500
<i>But why were</i>
<i>his bruises throbbing?</i>

1:22:51.207 --> 1:22:52.008
<i>And his eyes.</i>

1:22:53.539 --> 1:22:57.706
<i>When I looked in them,</i>
<i>they reminded me of a child.</i>

1:22:58.841 --> 1:23:00.709
A child!

1:23:05.452 --> 1:23:06.385
That kid's voice!

1:23:06.684 --> 1:23:08.057
Huh?

1:23:08.092 --> 1:23:09.124
That's my song.

1:23:09.159 --> 1:23:10.389
We're the only two that know it.

1:23:10.754 --> 1:23:13.425
There, find out who's
singing that song!

1:23:13.460 --> 1:23:15.130
-Is she okay?
-Where are you?

1:23:15.792 --> 1:23:17.594
Come on, where are you?

1:23:18.267 --> 1:23:21.433
<i>♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪</i>

1:23:21.468 --> 1:23:23.699
<i>♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪</i>

1:23:25.769 --> 1:23:31.245
<i>♪ La, la, la, la, la,</i>
<i>la, la, la, la, la ♪</i>

1:23:33.711 --> 1:23:36.778
That kid,
I recognize him.

1:23:39.189 --> 1:23:41.717
<i>To me...</i>
<i>the Beast, he's my hero.</i>

1:23:41.752 --> 1:23:43.686
<i>It's been tough since</i>
<i>they lost their mom,</i>

1:23:43.721 --> 1:23:45.193
<i>but at least they're happy.</i>

1:23:46.462 --> 1:23:47.461
<i>-We just take it day by day,</i>

1:23:47.497 --> 1:23:48.162
<i>enjoying the little</i>
<i>things in life.</i>

1:23:48.198 --> 1:23:48.963
<i>We support each other...</i>

1:23:50.563 --> 1:23:52.233
How does
he know this song?

1:23:52.763 --> 1:23:53.597
I'm gonna zoom in.

1:23:57.735 --> 1:24:01.638
<i>♪ La, la, la, la,</i>
<i>la, la, la, la la ♪</i>

1:24:02.212 --> 1:24:03.541
<i>♪ La, la, la ♪</i>

1:24:06.315 --> 1:24:09.184
<i>♪ La, la, la ♪</i>

1:24:09.219 --> 1:24:11.483
It's Belle.

1:24:12.486 --> 1:24:14.354
<i>♪ La, la, la, la, la, la ♪</i>

1:24:14.686 --> 1:24:17.225
So does that mean
this kid's the Beast?

1:24:18.195 --> 1:24:19.359
Something's off.

1:24:19.394 --> 1:24:20.690
What do you mean?

1:24:20.725 --> 1:24:22.824
I can't explain why,
but I don't think it's him.

1:24:23.431 --> 1:24:25.497
Me neither,
and I didn't see any bruises.

1:24:27.501 --> 1:24:29.534
<i>♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪</i>

1:24:30.801 --> 1:24:32.174
<i>Tomo.</i>

1:24:32.209 --> 1:24:33.373
<i>What is that you're singing?</i>

1:24:34.244 --> 1:24:36.145
<i>I'm trying to focus</i>
<i>on my work.</i>

1:24:36.180 --> 1:24:37.839
<i>I can't do that when</i>
<i>you're making a ruckus.</i>

1:24:39.843 --> 1:24:42.514
<i>♪ La, la, la, la, la, la ♪</i>

1:24:48.258 --> 1:24:51.226
<i>Why don't you ever</i>
<i>listen to anything I say?</i>

1:24:51.261 --> 1:24:54.229
<i>The world is full of rules</i>
<i>that everyone has to follow.</i>

1:24:54.264 --> 1:24:56.660
<i>And in this house,</i>
<i>I make the rules.</i>

1:24:57.201 --> 1:24:58.200
<i>If you can't follow them,</i>

1:24:58.236 --> 1:24:59.564
<i>what's going to</i>
<i>become of you, huh?</i>

1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:02.303
<i>Are you listening?</i>

1:25:02.668 --> 1:25:03.799
<i>Do I have to repeat myself?</i>

1:25:05.671 --> 1:25:07.242
<i>Do you need to be</i>
<i>taught a lesson?</i>

1:25:07.277 --> 1:25:09.376
<i>Stop it!</i>

1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:10.872
<i>Tomo didn't do anything wrong.</i>

1:25:10.907 --> 1:25:12.214
<i>Move it!</i>

1:25:12.249 --> 1:25:13.380
<i>Please don't!</i>

1:25:13.415 --> 1:25:15.217
<i> How dare you?</i>
<i>Now move!</i>

1:25:15.549 --> 1:25:17.384
<i>Tomo, don't listen.</i>

1:25:17.419 --> 1:25:18.847
<i> If I can't work,</i>

1:25:18.882 --> 1:25:20.288
<i>how am I supposed</i>
<i>to provide for you?</i>

1:25:20.323 --> 1:25:22.290
<i>All of this is my fault, okay?</i>

1:25:22.325 --> 1:25:23.390
<i>It's not yours.</i>

1:25:23.425 --> 1:25:25.293
<i> You're already 14, Kei.</i>

1:25:25.328 --> 1:25:26.525
<i>You should know better!</i>

1:25:28.430 --> 1:25:29.891
<i>I'll be here to protect you.</i>

1:25:31.327 --> 1:25:33.565
<i> How will you ever be the</i>
<i>man of the house like this?</i>

1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:34.896
<i>-Huh?</i>
<i>-There, there,</i>

1:25:34.931 --> 1:25:36.568
<i>it'll all be okay.</i>

1:25:37.938 --> 1:25:40.572
<i> If you guys don't want</i>
<i>to listen to me, then leave.</i>

1:25:40.904 --> 1:25:42.706
<i>-Get out of here!</i>

1:25:42.741 --> 1:25:44.807
<i> Go on, just, just leave!</i>

1:25:49.484 --> 1:25:51.385
<i>I just have to endure this.</i>

1:25:56.920 --> 1:25:58.194
This boy.

1:25:59.329 --> 1:26:00.262
He's the Beast.

1:26:01.958 --> 1:26:02.792
It's him.

1:26:09.999 --> 1:26:11.504
Look.

1:26:11.539 --> 1:26:12.604
Huh?

1:26:22.781 --> 1:26:23.945
How could he?

1:26:23.980 --> 1:26:24.847
There's no excuse.

1:26:26.653 --> 1:26:28.818
<i>Hey, Kei, are you all right?</i>

1:26:29.788 --> 1:26:31.491
I see.

1:26:31.526 --> 1:26:32.459
I think I get it now.

1:26:33.595 --> 1:26:36.265
Kei wanted to be a hero so
he could be there for Tomo.

1:26:38.665 --> 1:26:39.829
<i>Kei?</i>

1:26:39.864 --> 1:26:42.238
Look at the situation
they're in.

1:26:42.537 --> 1:26:44.636
This is why the Beast
is so strong.

1:26:44.671 --> 1:26:46.605
Since U's
body sharing technology

1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:48.376
reveals the hidden you,

1:26:48.675 --> 1:26:51.643
enduring all this pain must
be the source of his strength.

1:26:52.679 --> 1:26:55.284
It's not unlike how
Suzu became Belle.

1:27:09.564 --> 1:27:10.761
<i> Connected.</i>

1:27:13.403 --> 1:27:14.028
Hello?

1:27:15.064 --> 1:27:16.338
Can you see me?

1:27:17.473 --> 1:27:18.538
Can you hear my voice?

1:27:20.410 --> 1:27:22.003
Um, I saw what happened.

1:27:23.479 --> 1:27:24.676
Don't--don't worry.

1:27:24.711 --> 1:27:26.381
Everything's going to be okay.

1:27:26.878 --> 1:27:28.350
Can...

1:27:28.385 --> 1:27:29.912
Can I come and see you?

1:27:30.585 --> 1:27:32.013
Just tell me where
you are and I'll...

1:27:32.048 --> 1:27:33.421
<i>Oh yeah?</i>

1:27:33.456 --> 1:27:35.522
<i>-Who are you?</i>

1:27:35.557 --> 1:27:36.787
He's never met you in real life.

1:27:38.626 --> 1:27:40.593
I'm Belle.

1:27:41.024 --> 1:27:42.958
<i>-Belle?</i>
<i>-Yeah, sure you are.</i>

1:27:43.565 --> 1:27:44.399
<i> Connected.</i>

1:27:45.567 --> 1:27:47.402
<i> See, what'd I tell you?</i>

1:27:47.437 --> 1:27:48.535
<i> Better call the cops.</i>

1:27:48.570 --> 1:27:49.703
<i> Straight up child abuse.</i>

1:27:49.738 --> 1:27:51.406
<i> We could</i>
<i>totally do that!</i>

1:27:56.545 --> 1:27:58.413
<i>Are you also</i>
<i>the kind of person</i>

1:27:58.448 --> 1:27:59.579
<i>who laughs at others' pain?</i>

1:27:59.614 --> 1:28:02.010
-No.
<i>-How was it?</i>

1:28:02.045 --> 1:28:04.045
<i>Did you have fun watching</i>
<i>how miserable we are?</i>

1:28:04.080 --> 1:28:05.387
No!

1:28:05.422 --> 1:28:06.454
You're wrong.

1:28:06.786 --> 1:28:08.786
I--I wanted to help
you in some way.

1:28:09.690 --> 1:28:11.360
That's actually
why I called you.

1:28:11.791 --> 1:28:13.428
I just want to help.

1:28:13.463 --> 1:28:15.089
<i>Help us by doing what?</i>

1:28:16.895 --> 1:28:18.664
<i>"I'll help you, I'll help you,</i>
<i>I'll help you."</i>

1:28:18.996 --> 1:28:20.765
<i>I've heard it so many times.</i>

1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:22.800
<i>"Let me talk to your father,"</i>

1:28:22.835 --> 1:28:24.802
<i>or "I've already</i>
<i>talked to your father,"</i>

1:28:24.837 --> 1:28:27.607
<i>or "I think that I got</i>
<i>through to your father,"</i>

1:28:27.642 --> 1:28:29.345
<i>but nothing ever changes.</i>

1:28:29.644 --> 1:28:31.072
<i>"I'll help you, I'll help you,</i>
<i>I'll help you."</i>

1:28:31.107 --> 1:28:32.513
<i>Is that so?</i>

1:28:33.142 --> 1:28:34.548
<i>How exactly will you help?</i>

1:28:36.112 --> 1:28:37.914
<i>"I'll help you,</i>
<i>I'll help you, I'll help you."</i>

1:28:37.949 --> 1:28:39.388
<i>What the hell do you know?</i>

1:28:40.557 --> 1:28:40.851
<i>"I'll help you, I'll help you,</i>
<i>I'll help you."</i>

1:28:41.887 --> 1:28:43.656
<i>Those words are</i>
<i>easy for you to say.</i>

1:28:43.691 --> 1:28:45.955
<i>Everyone's always</i>
<i>saying the same thing.</i>

1:28:45.990 --> 1:28:47.594
<i>"I want to help you,</i>
<i>I want to change things,</i>

1:28:47.629 --> 1:28:48.958
<i>I want to make it better.</i>

1:28:48.993 --> 1:28:49.992
<i>I'll help you,</i>
<i>I'll help you, I'll help you."</i>

1:28:50.028 --> 1:28:52.599
<i>You just repeat it</i>
<i>out of sympathy.</i>

1:28:52.634 --> 1:28:54.667
<i>In the end, it doesn't</i>
<i>change one little thing!</i>

1:28:56.539 --> 1:28:58.165
<i>"I'll help you, I'll help you,</i>
<i>I'll help you.</i>

1:28:58.200 --> 1:29:00.541
<i>I'll help you, I'll help you,</i>
<i>I'll help you, I'll help you!"</i>

1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:03.841
<i>Shut up already</i>
<i>and leave us alone!</i>

1:29:07.715 --> 1:29:09.847
-Kei, wait, come back!
-You're disconnected.

1:29:10.212 --> 1:29:12.014
Please, Kei, where are you?

1:29:12.049 --> 1:29:13.455
He isn't going to tell you!

1:29:14.920 --> 1:29:17.624
Why should he?
He has no reason to trust you.

1:29:19.529 --> 1:29:20.792
So what do we do now?

1:29:37.514 --> 1:29:38.678
There's one thing you can do,

1:29:38.713 --> 1:29:39.943
-sing.

1:29:40.715 --> 1:29:42.517
Everyone,
make room for Belle!

1:29:54.564 --> 1:29:57.433
Mark my words,
her song will draw him out.

1:29:58.799 --> 1:30:00.931
He'll show up for her,
just like he did before.

1:30:01.197 --> 1:30:02.669
I know he will.

1:30:13.176 --> 1:30:14.450
Don't do it as Belle.

1:30:15.915 --> 1:30:17.079
You need to do it as Suzu.

1:30:17.114 --> 1:30:18.751
-It's the only way.
-What?

1:30:18.786 --> 1:30:20.720
Have you gone totally insane?

1:30:20.755 --> 1:30:22.557
We need some way to
get his attention

1:30:22.592 --> 1:30:23.525
and this is how we do it.

1:30:23.560 --> 1:30:24.757
Do you know what you're saying?

1:30:24.792 --> 1:30:26.528
Do you know what happens
if she does this?

1:30:26.563 --> 1:30:27.958
It means it's the end

1:30:27.993 --> 1:30:30.862
of everything Suzu and I
have worked so hard for.

1:30:31.733 --> 1:30:34.063
But you need to gain his trust
and this is the way.

1:30:34.098 --> 1:30:36.967
Suzu, think about why
you've been doing all of this.

1:30:37.970 --> 1:30:39.904
Do you really want to
go back to the old you?

1:30:40.610 --> 1:30:42.104
Back to crying all the time,
is that what you want?

1:30:42.711 --> 1:30:44.645
You don't want that, do you?

1:30:50.554 --> 1:30:52.015
Though you didn't mean to do it,

1:30:52.050 --> 1:30:54.017
you unveiled him
to the entire world.

1:30:54.052 --> 1:30:55.854
So if you keep on
wearing a mask,

1:30:55.889 --> 1:30:58.186
how do you expect to
actually help him?

1:30:58.221 --> 1:30:59.957
And how are you supposed
to connect with him

1:30:59.992 --> 1:31:02.795
if you won't even show him
your true self?

1:31:12.840 --> 1:31:15.104
Damnit! Why isn't she singing?
Come, on!

1:31:31.958 --> 1:31:32.990
Sing now!

1:31:33.959 --> 1:31:35.630
Sing so we can draw out
your precocious beast.

1:31:35.962 --> 1:31:37.060
Sing to him!

1:31:39.768 --> 1:31:40.932
What are you doing?

1:31:41.132 --> 1:31:42.835
-Use your light on me.
-What?

1:31:43.035 --> 1:31:45.134
Your light!
I want you to use it on me.

1:31:49.173 --> 1:31:50.007
What's that?

1:31:50.614 --> 1:31:52.042
Are you crazy?

1:31:52.077 --> 1:31:53.945
If I do that, you'd be unveiled.
No one wants that!

1:32:31.952 --> 1:32:32.885
What is happening?

1:32:39.355 --> 1:32:41.355
It can't be. Is that Belle?

1:32:44.965 --> 1:32:47.702
She looks so different.
-Except they both have freckles.

1:32:47.737 --> 1:32:48.835
Belle was unveiled?

1:32:49.299 --> 1:32:50.903
Who unveiled her?

1:32:50.938 --> 1:32:52.333
She did it herself.

1:32:53.039 --> 1:32:55.369
This is bad!

1:32:55.404 --> 1:32:57.910
Why did someone
unveil Belle?

1:32:57.945 --> 1:33:00.044
Weren't you listening?
She did it to herself.

1:33:00.079 --> 1:33:02.783
-She did? But why?
-Yeah, what for?

1:33:03.412 --> 1:33:04.719
That's Belle?

1:33:04.754 --> 1:33:07.051
She's just an ordinary girl.

1:33:10.694 --> 1:33:13.695
This whole time,
she was just like me.

1:33:13.961 --> 1:33:16.665
We worked so hard
to keep this all a secret!

1:33:19.703 --> 1:33:21.670
Do you have the music
streaming app on here?

1:33:22.464 --> 1:33:24.002
-You can't!
-Suzu.

1:33:27.810 --> 1:33:28.941
She's gonna start!

1:33:33.981 --> 1:33:35.717
It's time to sing.

1:33:35.752 --> 1:33:37.147
She can't do it!

1:33:37.182 --> 1:33:38.918
That's why she needed
a different persona!

1:33:39.283 --> 1:33:40.414
She can.

1:33:40.449 --> 1:33:41.954
But what if she fails?

1:33:42.187 --> 1:33:43.791
-Poor thing.
-Oh, Suzu.

1:33:43.991 --> 1:33:45.958
-Come on.
-Suzu.

Suzu.

You reached them by
being your true self.

1:43:24.934 --> 1:43:28.342
Shinobu.
Thank you!

1:43:30.313 --> 1:43:31.708
I'm so relieved!

1:43:35.318 --> 1:43:36.515
Huh?

1:43:40.554 --> 1:43:41.619
<i>Why don't you ever listen</i>

1:43:41.654 --> 1:43:42.785
<i>to anything I say?</i>

1:43:43.788 --> 1:43:44.853
What the hell is this?

1:43:47.429 --> 1:43:48.626
<i>All right, our address is--</i>

1:43:51.796 --> 1:43:53.499
<i>Are we doing this again?</i>

1:43:53.534 --> 1:43:55.963
-<i> No.</i>
<i>-Kei, cut it out!</i>

1:43:55.998 --> 1:43:58.064
-<i> Stop.</i>
<i>-Move it!</i>

1:43:58.099 --> 1:43:58.933
-<i> Kei!</i>
<i>-You too!</i>

1:44:01.003 --> 1:44:01.936
<i>Get outta here!</i>

1:44:07.878 --> 1:44:09.812
Those two kids
are in danger.

1:44:09.847 --> 1:44:11.013
Something
has to be done.

1:44:11.048 --> 1:44:13.717
But where are they?
We never got the address.

1:44:14.049 --> 1:44:16.522
I think I have an idea
on how to figure it out.

1:44:16.887 --> 1:44:19.558
-Earlier, over the video call,

1:44:19.593 --> 1:44:21.329
I heard the evening
broadcast chimes.

1:44:21.364 --> 1:44:22.561
You did?

1:44:22.596 --> 1:44:24.530
First was "The Sunset Glow"

1:44:24.565 --> 1:44:26.598
and then later "The Coconut."

1:44:27.095 --> 1:44:29.568
Those get played
during the daily PSA's.

1:44:29.603 --> 1:44:30.833
It's usually one.

1:44:30.868 --> 1:44:33.000
Then they must be in
between two other cities.

1:44:33.035 --> 1:44:34.408
But which ones?

1:44:34.443 --> 1:44:35.574
I'm looking it up.

1:44:35.609 --> 1:44:36.707
I have a recording from earlier!

1:44:48.721 --> 1:44:49.687
She's right.

1:44:49.722 --> 1:44:51.425
Whoa,
Ruka's got some sharp ears!

1:44:51.724 --> 1:44:53.394
Hey, look at
the window.

1:44:53.429 --> 1:44:54.593
Can you zoom in?

1:44:54.628 --> 1:44:56.056
What are those,
high-rises?

1:44:56.091 --> 1:44:57.893
Luxury condos?

1:44:57.928 --> 1:44:59.730
Hang on,
there's two of them.

1:44:59.765 --> 1:45:01.600
But where?
We have to find out.

1:45:01.635 --> 1:45:03.503
I know, but we need more info.

1:45:03.538 --> 1:45:06.506
Hey. Hm. Mm.

1:45:07.003 --> 1:45:09.608
Ruka! I actually think I might
know where that is!

1:45:09.643 --> 1:45:10.972
-Huh?
-Hang on.

1:45:11.007 --> 1:45:13.106
Okay, um, where was that?

1:45:13.141 --> 1:45:14.382
Hurry it up!

1:45:15.550 --> 1:45:16.615
-I found it.
-Where is it?

1:45:17.751 --> 1:45:18.783
<i> Out of</i>
<i>the five condos in Tokyo,</i>

1:45:18.819 --> 1:45:19.951
<i>the ones with two</i>
<i>tall buildings are</i>

1:45:19.987 --> 1:45:21.851
<i>between the Ota District</i>
<i>and Kawasaki City.</i>

1:45:22.150 --> 1:45:23.787
Is this it? Look!

1:45:26.528 --> 1:45:28.759
It's matching all
the criteria. I think we got it!

1:45:28.794 --> 1:45:29.925
-Nice work.
-Yeah!

1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:31.124
-Yes!

1:45:31.159 --> 1:45:33.126
Hello? I need you to
do a wellness

1:45:33.161 --> 1:45:35.062
check on a couple of children.

1:45:35.097 --> 1:45:36.129
I don't have an address,

1:45:36.164 --> 1:45:38.131
but I can give you
the neighborhood.

1:45:38.166 --> 1:45:39.935
Huh?
Why can't you do anything?

1:45:41.444 --> 1:45:42.476
It's the law?

1:45:43.446 --> 1:45:45.611
You have to wait 48 hours?

1:45:45.646 --> 1:45:47.712
But what if something
happens before then?

1:45:48.451 --> 1:45:49.681
I have to go.

1:45:49.881 --> 1:45:51.650
Suzu!

1:45:51.685 --> 1:45:52.816
I'll drive you to the station.

1:45:53.016 --> 1:45:53.916
Suzu!

1:46:02.058 --> 1:46:03.893
There are no more
flights to Tokyo.

1:46:03.928 --> 1:46:05.829
And driving will take too long.

1:46:12.541 --> 1:46:14.508
Will she be okay on her own?

1:46:14.543 --> 1:46:15.806
I think that she's going to be.

1:46:22.914 --> 1:46:24.749
<i> Sorry I left without</i>
<i>saying anything, Dad,</i>

1:46:25.752 --> 1:46:26.850
<i>but I needed to go somewhere.</i>

1:46:31.758 --> 1:46:33.593
<i> I received a message</i>
<i>from the choir ladies.</i>

1:46:34.794 --> 1:46:36.695
<i> And I'm sorry</i>
<i>I've been so selfish.</i>

1:46:36.961 --> 1:46:39.566
<i>Don't worry, I trust you.</i>

1:46:40.932 --> 1:46:42.932
<i> Someone important</i>
<i>to me is in trouble.</i>

1:46:43.902 --> 1:46:46.441
<i> So you're doing</i>
<i>this to help somebody.</i>

1:46:47.576 --> 1:46:49.675
<i> But I don't know</i>
<i>what to do.</i>

1:46:51.041 --> 1:46:52.612
<i>How do I help them?</i>

1:46:55.210 --> 1:46:56.550
<i> You've...</i>

1:46:57.719 --> 1:46:59.916
<i>You've been so sad ever</i>
<i>since your mom died.</i>

1:47:02.657 --> 1:47:03.920
<i>I can see</i>
<i>that you're suffering.</i>

1:47:05.990 --> 1:47:07.462
<i>Life's been tough for you,</i>

1:47:09.961 --> 1:47:11.466
<i>but at the same time,</i>

1:47:12.667 --> 1:47:14.700
<i>you've grown up to be</i>
<i>such a caring person.</i>

1:47:16.132 --> 1:47:19.100
<i>You relate to and understand</i>
<i>what people are feeling.</i>

1:47:21.676 --> 1:47:27.515
<i>Suzu, I think...</i>
<i>you are so kind</i>

1:47:29.618 --> 1:47:30.980
<i>because of the way</i>
<i>Mom raised you.</i>

1:47:35.789 --> 1:47:39.824
<i>So just keep on</i>
<i>being that kind girl.</i>

1:48:35.750 --> 1:48:37.079
This is it.

1:48:37.114 --> 1:48:38.784
-Belle?

1:48:40.722 --> 1:48:42.689
You came. You're really here.

1:48:42.724 --> 1:48:43.789
Tomo!

1:48:44.726 --> 1:48:45.725
Belle.

1:48:52.162 --> 1:48:53.568
It's okay.

1:48:53.933 --> 1:48:54.965
Everything's gonna be okay.

1:48:58.036 --> 1:48:59.002
You're really here.

1:48:59.301 --> 1:49:00.608
And you're Belle?

1:49:12.116 --> 1:49:13.885
Boys, where are you?

1:49:14.954 --> 1:49:16.217
Tomo, Kei?

1:49:17.759 --> 1:49:18.758
Kei!

1:49:18.793 --> 1:49:20.793
I wasn't done talking to you.

1:49:23.325 --> 1:49:24.797
Who the hell are you? Hm?

1:49:25.030 --> 1:49:27.063
Are you the one posting
lies on the internet?

1:49:27.802 --> 1:49:28.768
How dare you!

1:49:36.173 --> 1:49:39.240
Kei, Tomo,
go back inside now.

1:49:39.275 --> 1:49:40.241
You shouldn't be out here.

1:49:41.145 --> 1:49:42.782
I'm your father!

1:49:42.817 --> 1:49:44.212

1:49:45.853 --> 1:49:47.985
Let go of them,
mind your own business!

1:49:48.757 --> 1:49:50.691
You trying to tear
my family apart?

1:49:52.420 --> 1:49:53.793
Is that what you want?

1:49:55.192 --> 1:49:57.159
Well, I won't let you!

1:50:59.421 --> 1:51:00.893
Belle.

1:51:01.995 --> 1:51:02.829
Huh?

1:51:04.261 --> 1:51:06.360
I realized it when you
hugged us just now.

1:51:07.803 --> 1:51:09.770
It turns out you
really are Belle.

1:51:11.873 --> 1:51:13.169
Thank you for finding us.

1:51:14.271 --> 1:51:17.371
Because I hoped
you would show up.

1:51:20.376 --> 1:51:22.343
I've wanted to meet you,
the real you.

1:51:24.083 --> 1:51:24.917
Same with me.

1:51:35.160 --> 1:51:37.391
After watching you stand up
for what you believe in,

1:51:38.031 --> 1:51:40.834
it was at that moment
I knew what to do

1:51:40.869 --> 1:51:42.737
and that's why
I'm going to fight.

1:51:45.236 --> 1:51:46.466
You know what?

1:51:46.501 --> 1:51:48.072
I learned from you too.

1:51:48.107 --> 1:51:50.877
Because of you, I found
strength I didn't know I had.

1:51:50.912 --> 1:51:52.043
I'm finally free.

1:51:53.409 --> 1:51:54.474
Thank you.

1:51:57.853 --> 1:51:59.017
You're my hero, Belle.

1:52:01.285 --> 1:52:02.086
Thanks for that.

1:52:03.254 --> 1:52:04.825
Yeah, Belle, you're great.

1:52:05.487 --> 1:52:06.486
You're amazing.

1:52:06.928 --> 1:52:08.389
And I think you're beautiful.

1:53:00.146 --> 1:53:02.509
So. Dinner?

1:53:05.217 --> 1:53:06.348
Yes, please.

1:53:08.484 --> 1:53:10.154
Then how about bonito?

1:53:12.554 --> 1:53:13.828
I'm back, Dad.

1:53:15.392 --> 1:53:16.556
Welcome home.

1:53:17.900 --> 1:53:18.899
Suzu!

1:53:20.034 --> 1:53:21.462
Welcome back!

1:53:22.168 --> 1:53:24.003
I knew she could do it.

1:53:24.038 --> 1:53:25.334
So, does this mean
you and Kamishin

going all the way out there

1:53:38.184 --> 1:53:39.216
and protecting those kids.

1:53:40.285 --> 1:53:41.856
It was pretty cool.

1:53:47.556 --> 1:53:49.622
All right, well,
that's a load off!

1:53:50.559 --> 1:53:52.900
Now that I don't have to
worry about you all the time,

1:53:52.935 --> 1:53:54.902
we can finally have some fun.

1:53:54.937 --> 1:53:56.629
