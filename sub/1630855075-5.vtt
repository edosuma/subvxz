00:11.845 --> 00:15.765
Arthur West was a man
of many passions.

00:15.765 --> 00:19.686
He loved sports,
his Bears, his Blackhawks.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.105
The Cubs winning
the division title last week

00:22.105 --> 00:24.941
must have brought him tremendous joy.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.861
So much that he jumped off
a building, but sure.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.780
And, of course, he loved his music.

00:31.656 --> 00:36.661
Here to sing one of Arthur's favorites
from Chicago singer Tyrone Davis

00:36.661 --> 00:38.413
is his niece, Pam.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.084
<i>♪ Oh, darling ♪</i>

00:44.210 --> 00:48.465

00:49.591 --> 00:55.638

00:58.349 --> 01:03.104

01:03.104 --> 01:06.900

01:10.528 --> 01:14.657
<i>♪ If I could turn back the hands of time ♪</i>

01:24.417 --> 01:26.920
Mom, what are you doing?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.379
I bought this today.

01:28.379 --> 01:33.092
I knew I should've got another size up
because this only takes three at a time.

01:33.593 --> 01:34.552
It'll take all night.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.055
It was real nice you came to the funeral.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.891
But you don't need to do
whatever you're doing.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.936
- Yes, I do. And you could help.
- With what?

01:44.854 --> 01:46.731
Oh, my God. You don't know.

01:46.731 --> 01:47.816
What, Ma?

01:48.650 --> 01:51.986
One thing you inherited from him
is no head for business.

01:51.986 --> 01:55.698
He would have gone bust if I hadn't
found a way to keep him afloat.

01:55.698 --> 02:00.245
But the one thing I told him, I said,
"Do not skim! Not from these people."

02:00.829 --> 02:02.747
You got dad laundering money?

02:02.747 --> 02:05.542
I didn't see you complain
when you opened that bar of yours.

02:05.542 --> 02:09.629
The bar is making money now.
I can stop drawing cash in six months.

02:09.629 --> 02:12.423
There is no money, Del. It's over!

02:12.423 --> 02:13.508
God.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.261
Goddamn it!

02:17.011 --> 02:17.971
I broke a nail.

02:18.847 --> 02:19.806
Wait...

02:20.932 --> 02:24.144
- There's no money. There's nothing?
- No.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.607
And even if the police
don't investigate his suicide,

02:29.607 --> 02:31.276
the insurance companies will,

02:31.276 --> 02:34.154
so I'm making sure that
there's nothing to fall back on anyone.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.657
Why did you say "suicide" like that?

02:41.619 --> 02:43.997
You really think
your father killed himself?

02:49.169 --> 02:50.211
No.

02:51.087 --> 02:54.090
The mobster he was skimming from
must have come to Chicago.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.677
They met at that hotel
with the rooftop bar,

02:57.677 --> 03:02.015
which I know because
he put the drinks on his card.

03:03.474 --> 03:06.728
You owe somebody money
and you go to a rooftop?

03:06.728 --> 03:08.771
I mean, who does that?

03:08.771 --> 03:11.482
Two drinks. One old fashioned.

03:11.482 --> 03:14.861
You ever see Arthur West
drink an old fashioned?

03:14.861 --> 03:18.531
Next thing you know,
he's 13 stories down on the sidewalk.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.910
People out celebrating the Cubs.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.621
Bam! Everyone's screaming.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.290
Celebration over.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.460
Who killed Dad?

03:30.460 --> 03:33.880
Never mind who.
Someone he would never want you to meet.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.674
Come on. Shred.

03:38.426 --> 03:39.469
"Bogdan Yankov"?

03:41.012 --> 03:41.888
I said shred!

04:04.869 --> 04:07.205
Fuck.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.811
Excuse me.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.647
Can I get you to sign the guest book?

04:33.314 --> 04:35.817
Maybe write down
how you know the deceased.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.444
The deceased?

04:39.737 --> 04:40.863
Bogdan Yankov?

04:49.622 --> 04:50.707
Fucking idiot!

04:52.875 --> 04:54.043
I mean...

04:54.627 --> 04:55.878
Lose something?

04:59.257 --> 05:00.258
Um...

05:03.052 --> 05:04.429
What? No.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.474
Um...

05:08.474 --> 05:12.103
No. Sorry. Just lost my lighter.
Dropped my lighter.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.023
You can use mine.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.734
Okay.

05:18.693 --> 05:19.986
Thanks.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.409
Sad day.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.619
Sure is.

05:29.662 --> 05:30.872
Want a cigarette?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.541
I don't smoke.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.710
Then why do you have a lighter?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.130
They let me light the candles.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.888
Are you getting a cold?

05:46.888 --> 05:47.805
What?

05:48.765 --> 05:49.849
Oh.

05:51.267 --> 05:54.020
It was in their medicine cabinet,

05:54.020 --> 05:55.813
when I was cleaning it out.

05:56.689 --> 06:01.027
My... mom used to put this on me.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.364
You're his son?

06:08.076 --> 06:09.160
Moss.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.458
Sorry for your loss.

07:06.425 --> 07:09.762
Yeah, yeah, I know,
but we do it tonight or never.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.764
Tomorrow they're covering the sinkhole.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.517
Unless there's somebody else

- Can you bring me a juice?

08:54.742 --> 08:57.203

<i>- The kitchen.</i>

08:57.203 --> 09:00.164
- I'm not in the kitchen. I'm at work.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.750

09:02.750 --> 09:04.418

09:04.418 --> 09:05.836

<i>You'll have to take care

09:08.506 --> 09:11.384
I have to get a mother to pull the plug
on her brain-dead son.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.803
I don't mean that as an insult.
His brain is dead.

09:30.486 --> 09:34.282
Sorry, I keep staring,
but you're her, right?

09:34.282 --> 09:37.410
- From that show?
- No, not me.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.745
No. You know what it is?

09:39.745 --> 09:42.999
You remind me of someone I know
from back home.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.544
- Yeah?
- Yeah. In Philly.

09:48.546 --> 09:52.258
But it can't be because she died.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.303
In fact, I just went to her funeral.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.639
- Sad.
- I know.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.474
I'm Iris.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.184
Do you mind?

10:09.317 --> 10:13.779
- You'd be the former Mrs. Mike, then?
- And you'd be the late Delly West.

10:13.779 --> 10:18.492
Careful. Last person who came looking
for me is being scraped off a toilet.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.412
You're not threatening a cop, I hope.

10:22.913 --> 10:27.585
- Are you a cop? This far from home?
- I'm just sightseeing for now.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.254
Looking for a boat.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.840
Oh, you don't want a boat. Bad investment.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.844
Sure was for Gil Franco, right?
What were you and Mike doing on his boat?

10:37.803 --> 10:41.682
Thinking about a fishing trip.
Kind of like the one you're on.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.186
New topic, but also maybe not.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.938
Why would you fake your death
for Moss Yankov?

10:48.856 --> 10:51.692
We like playing hide and seek.
I'm winning.

10:52.693 --> 10:53.944
Are you, though?

10:54.862 --> 10:56.739
Nice.

10:57.239 --> 10:58.741
Put a couple filters on that,

10:58.741 --> 11:02.495
send it to Moss and he can use it
for your next obituary photo.

11:04.538 --> 11:07.291
Gil Franco's death
has nothing to do with me.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.919
All that's gonna give you
is one more body.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.922
It kind of does
have something to do with you.

11:12.922 --> 11:16.217
See, Moss named you as his alibi
the night Gil Franco was killed.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.676
He's lying.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.053
And you?

11:19.929 --> 11:22.723
- Do you have an alibi?
- Yes.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.809
I don't think you wanna hear it.

11:24.809 --> 11:25.851
Oh, I really do.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.895
Okay. I was fucking your ex-husband.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.732
So I guess that gives him an alibi too.

11:31.732 --> 11:35.111
If you need corroboration, there might
have been a homeless guy watching.

11:36.320 --> 11:41.075
Wow. I certainly don't want to ruin
such an epic love story.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.452
I just want to solve a murder.

11:44.078 --> 11:47.790
Uh-huh. But you're doing it
a thousand miles from where it happened.

11:49.834 --> 11:54.004
When Moss finds you, and let's face it,
you're not that hard to find,

11:54.004 --> 11:56.465
Mike is gonna want to protect you.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.134
And I don't want him killed.

11:58.134 --> 12:02.513
So, yeah, maybe I came down here
to drag him out of one last casino.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.976
Whatever you think is happening
with you and Mike,

12:06.976 --> 12:10.396
it's not just him you're running with.
It's also his addiction.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.731
Trust me, we were
in a threesome for years.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.234
So my advice?

12:15.234 --> 12:21.282
Either get out before the luck turns
or make sure that slot keeps paying off.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.371
I didn't kill Gil. Mike didn't kill Gil.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.832
And you will never hang this murder
on Moss.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.751
- Why is that?
- Firstly, he didn't do it. Not personally.

12:33.586 --> 12:37.089
He also won't roll on whoever he had do it
and they won't roll on him,

12:37.089 --> 12:39.842
so you're going home with nothing.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.219
That sucks.

12:42.219 --> 12:46.182
Mike and Delly went to Florida
and all I got was this lousy photo.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.393
Or...

12:51.687 --> 12:55.232
I can give you something
to take down Moss' entire operation.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.109
And you get?

12:58.068 --> 12:59.195
That picture.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.114
And 24 hours to disappear again.

13:02.114 --> 13:06.160
I like being dead,
but only this much dead, not all the way.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.748
Airplane, home today.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.084
No Space Mountain. No Harry Potter World.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.253
Just drop your car at the airport
and fuck off.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.963
Morning.

13:58.963 --> 14:02.132
- Welcome, my friend.
- A lovely town you have.

14:02.132 --> 14:06.387
Thank you, thank you,
many things to do at the beach.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.429
The rockets.

14:07.429 --> 14:12.768
Ah. I see why my friend chose this place.
Mike Valentine?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.564
Uh, Mike Valentine?

14:18.190 --> 14:20.943
Yes, Mike Valentine. He here?

14:21.652 --> 14:24.280
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.491
But to respect the privacy of our guest,

14:27.491 --> 14:30.202
it is the policy of ownership
not to give out information

14:30.202 --> 14:32.162
as to whether they are here or not.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.331
Maybe leave your name and number?

14:35.916 --> 14:38.460
Uh, that's okay.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.921
It's more fun to surprise him anyway.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.633
Wow.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.469
I haven't seen this one in years.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.432
My dad, he worked with
vending machine companies.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.101
And coming up,
when I was learning the family business,

14:54.101 --> 14:57.313
I picked up on a few quirks
of the various models.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.772
See, like this one.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.442
If you give it a punch...

15:03.152 --> 15:06.363
in the right spot, you get a free soda.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.538
Very nice.

15:16.707 --> 15:20.586
I haven't been involved
at that level in a while, you know...

15:21.545 --> 15:25.049
sleeves rolled up, getting the job done,
that sort of thing.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.218
But fuck it.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.888
I'm on vacation, right?

15:35.643 --> 15:36.936
He's in room two!

15:38.187 --> 15:39.104
Great.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.065
<i>Coming up after the break,</i>

15:41.065 --> 15:44.568
<i>we'll have Johnny Football with
the latest in prep and college highlights,</i>

15:44.568 --> 15:46.779
<i>plus a preview
of this weekend's NFL matchup...</i>

15:46.779 --> 15:48.822
You okay if I turn it off a sec?

15:56.330 --> 15:57.873
Good looking boy.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.084
Jason.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.544
Jason.

16:03.963 --> 16:04.838
Patsy.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.549
I wanted to see how you are.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.886
They want to take his organs.

16:17.476 --> 16:21.522
I just want to say
it's such an unfair decision

16:21.522 --> 16:23.232
they're asking you to make.

16:23.774 --> 16:24.608
As a mom.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.446
Kids?

16:29.446 --> 16:30.614
A daughter.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.493
<i>Goddamn it,
I gave birth to a goddamn car alarm.</i>

16:34.493 --> 16:38.205
<i>Why don't you let me take her.</i>
<i>And do what? Breastfeed her?</i>

16:38.205 --> 16:40.916
<i>I'm all there is between her and death.
Just me.</i>

16:40.916 --> 16:44.336
<i>Is she grateful? No.
She's mad at me. I can't do it, Ted.</i>

16:44.336 --> 16:48.966
<i>You said I could and you lied.
You don't even want to have sex with me!</i>

16:48.966 --> 16:50.467
<i>Wait, what?</i>

16:54.513 --> 16:55.597
You were right.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.516
- Ow!
- Be still.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.478
Mike Valentine.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.897
Coming to this place.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.443
I should have listened.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.030
We won't let these people stop us.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.531
American dream.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.951
A dream is what happens
when you are asleep

17:15.951 --> 17:18.245
and other people come and beat you.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.247
With a Mello Yello.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.999
We made a plan.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.417
We stay to it.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.294
Do what's best for our family.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.255
We'll be okay.

17:30.466 --> 17:34.636
And maybe start sleeping
with one eye open.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.846
Yeah, yeah.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.642
Where is Samuel?

17:48.734 --> 17:53.906
I heard rockets lift off around here.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.742
You ever seen a rocket lift off?

17:58.368 --> 18:01.455
If I lived here, I'd go all the time.

18:01.455 --> 18:05.584
I get it. In Philly, people come from all
over the world to see the Liberty Bell.

18:05.584 --> 18:09.505
I've seen it once on a school trip.
It was boring.

18:09.505 --> 18:13.425
I spent the whole time
throwing acorns at a horse.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.773
Where'd you get this?

18:30.192 --> 18:31.276
It's okay.

18:32.861 --> 18:33.821
I won't tell.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.240
One of the rooms.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.575
Room two?

18:39.451 --> 18:41.245
I'm just gonna put it back.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.789
Oh, no, no, no. I'll do it.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.208
Remember.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.794
Don't steal.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.712
Tell the truth.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.090
Take care of your teeth.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.759
Do all that...

18:58.887 --> 19:00.472
you'll make your parents proud.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.723
Sammy!

19:02.808 --> 19:05.144
Sammy! Out. Out!

19:13.652 --> 19:15.821
<i>Hi. This is Mike. Leave a message.</i>

19:16.363 --> 19:18.157
Mike Valentine, call me.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.408
We need to talk.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.703
<i>I'm sure she doesn't hate you.</i>

19:22.703 --> 19:23.745
No, seriously.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.539
She acts like I did something to her.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.457
Like the other day,

19:27.457 --> 19:30.752
she said she wants to be an astronaut,
and I said, "That's great!"

19:30.752 --> 19:33.547
Thinking, "Finally some ambition."

19:33.547 --> 19:38.552
And she said it's because she wants
to get as far away from me as she can.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.221
Well, I can be mean too.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.848
I told her, "Good luck with that.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.392
I don't know of any astronauts
that got a D in math."

19:45.976 --> 19:49.605
And, yes, everyone says that's just how
14-year-old girls are with their mothers.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.107
But I wouldn't know.
Mine was gone by then.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.151
So I know how blessed I am,

19:54.151 --> 19:57.529
but it's possible to feel blessed
and wanna murder them at the same time.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.493
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.330
I apologize. I really do.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.374
No. He's a fuck-up.

20:11.084 --> 20:11.919
Sorry?

20:12.920 --> 20:16.173
It took him three times
to pass the EMT test.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.093
But he did it.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.098
Maybe he's a late bloomer.

20:26.141 --> 20:29.686
And that's the hardest part,
is that if he dies now,

20:30.479 --> 20:32.522
this is all he is.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.441
A fuck-up forever.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.526
- No chance to bloom.
- No.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.363
This young man wanted to save lives.

20:41.406 --> 20:45.077
Now he can by donating his organs.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.746
He won't be a screw-up.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.082
He'll be a hero.

20:55.170 --> 20:58.799
A mother's whole job
is to keep them alive.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.427
It's the whole job.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.182
A mother's job is to meet their needs.

21:09.142 --> 21:12.271
What he needs now, you're the only one
that can give it to him.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.741
Should I get the doctor in?

21:48.056 --> 21:50.767
We'll keep the gear in here,
come back at dark and do this.

21:50.767 --> 21:51.977
Okay. Okay. Okay.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.855
Everybody tell me your favorite movie
from the last ten years

21:54.855 --> 21:57.065
without a Minion in it. Go.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.653
- All right. I'll tell you mine--
- Shh.

22:24.301 --> 22:27.429
- What are you guys doing here?
- I could ask you the same thing, buddy.

22:28.805 --> 22:32.184
We're here for the meeting.
Isn't there a meeting today?

22:33.769 --> 22:36.605
There is.
You guys are just in the wrong room.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.815
Come, follow me, we're this way.

22:39.399 --> 22:42.069
With all the damage,
the church doesn't want us in here,

22:42.069 --> 22:44.321
- but we're damaged people ourselves...
Of course.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.198
...so I think it's a good fit.

22:53.371 --> 22:54.498
I'm sorry.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.376
<i>She's so beautiful.</i>

22:59.086 --> 23:01.421
<i>See? Just need a break. That's all.</i>

23:01.421 --> 23:04.424
<i>- Let's get a sitter this week and go out.
- Okay.</i>

23:05.258 --> 23:06.843
I can stay with Jason.

23:16.394 --> 23:18.313
<i>Shh. I think she's asleep.</i>

23:26.113 --> 23:29.783
<i>Okay, sweetie.
Just going to put you down now.</i>

23:51.179 --> 23:53.682
<i>Hi. This is Mike. Leave a message.</i>

23:53.682 --> 23:56.393
Michael. It's done.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.145
You have your body.

24:10.740 --> 24:14.119
How is he still breathing
if his brain is dead?

24:14.119 --> 24:16.204
Maybe drugs still in the system.

24:16.204 --> 24:18.832
Sometimes,
if there's no other organ failure,

24:18.832 --> 24:20.834
they can breathe until the brain gives up.

24:20.834 --> 24:23.461
- Even a few more days.
- A few more days?

24:24.171 --> 24:25.213
Goodness.

24:25.714 --> 24:29.050
But he could also recover.
A miracle could happen.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.768
- You want anything?
- No, I'm okay.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.376
<i>Hi. This is Mike. Leave a message.</i>

25:03.376 --> 25:06.087
Mike. You cannot not call me back.

25:06.755 --> 25:09.966
You said you're in trouble
if the boy's alive. He's alive.

25:09.966 --> 25:11.343
Call me.

25:13.094 --> 25:15.138
Hey, guys, I'm sorry. Um...

25:15.138 --> 25:18.725
No cell phones.
We have to put those in the basket, okay?

25:18.725 --> 25:19.643
Oh.

25:25.106 --> 25:27.192
- Here you go. Thanks.
Thank you very much.

25:31.738 --> 25:34.449
Usually we like to start
by welcoming newcomers

25:34.449 --> 25:38.703
and asking them
if they feel comfortable sharing with us

25:38.703 --> 25:40.413
what brought them here.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.378
Oh. Um...

25:47.629 --> 25:51.800
Well, hi, I'm Mike, and...

25:52.842 --> 25:55.220
and I'm an alcoholic, and I--

25:55.220 --> 25:59.516
Okay, Mike, that might be true,
but this is actually an Al-Anon meeting.

26:01.017 --> 26:03.228
He's got a gambling problem,
if that helps.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.356
Uh, no, it does not.

26:06.356 --> 26:09.359
But, Mike, do you have any family members

26:09.359 --> 26:12.487
or loved ones who have particular
behaviors that might trigger you--

26:12.487 --> 26:14.155
- Yeah, my father.
- Oh, please.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.831
- If you give me one second--
- My mom died.

26:26.793 --> 26:27.711
She had cancer.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.674
And I'm saying she died...

26:33.800 --> 26:36.052
and also she had cancer,
two different facts.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.597
She was fighting it.
Her spirits were good.

26:40.807 --> 26:44.602
And then one day
I came home from football practice...

26:46.563 --> 26:48.106
and she had shot herself.

26:48.982 --> 26:51.359
In the bathtub. Not to make a mess.

26:52.152 --> 26:55.572
I was the only one home,
my dad was at work.

26:55.572 --> 26:59.034
So I called 911, they took her away and...

26:59.951 --> 27:03.121
and then I was left to clean up
the pieces of my mother's head

27:03.121 --> 27:05.999
so that when my sister came home,
she didn't have to see that.

27:07.042 --> 27:13.131
The lie we told her was that mom
had taken a bad turn from her cancer

27:13.131 --> 27:14.716
and died in the hospital.

27:15.258 --> 27:18.762
Not that she blew her brains out
with my father's gun.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.056
Oh, yeah, he was a cop.

27:21.056 --> 27:24.851
And his personal weapon
was always locked up, but not this day.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.062
This day it wasn't.

27:27.562 --> 27:30.690
And my mom got to it
and killed herself with it.

27:32.359 --> 27:35.403
When the investigating officers
returned the gun to my dad,

27:36.154 --> 27:38.156
he just put it back in the box.

27:39.908 --> 27:43.536
I didn't understand how
he could even have it in the house.

27:45.580 --> 27:48.375
My mother, she was the one
who kept us on the right track.

27:48.375 --> 27:52.462
With her gone, my dad just
turned his back on everything she was.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.755
Everything.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.968
Most guys,
they think their dads are heroes

27:58.968 --> 28:03.598
until they become adults themselves
and can see them as flawed.

28:07.268 --> 28:11.815
Me, I got there at 13.

28:18.488 --> 28:21.825
Wow, Mike, thank you for sharing.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.870
Does anybody else have anything
they would like to share with the group?

28:25.870 --> 28:27.163
Yeah, I'll go.

28:28.623 --> 28:33.837
In an unusual coincidence,
my wife had cancer too.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.924
But her spirits were not good.

28:38.591 --> 28:40.385
The pain she was in...

28:43.263 --> 28:45.974
She didn't want the kids to know
or be scared.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.561
But it was unimaginable.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.438
I think they're related.

28:51.438 --> 28:54.023
At night, when it got the worst...

28:55.692 --> 28:57.777
she would beg me...

29:00.113 --> 29:01.197
to die.

29:03.241 --> 29:08.121
And because I loved her more
than any woman that I had ever loved

29:08.121 --> 29:09.748
or will ever love...

29:12.667 --> 29:13.793
I gave her that.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.757
I left my gun unlocked.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.092
Not an accident.

29:23.219 --> 29:24.304
A choice.

29:25.638 --> 29:27.348
That I couldn't take back.

29:28.558 --> 29:32.187
And I went to work
and I sat there knowing...

29:34.606 --> 29:36.399
that when I got home...

29:41.154 --> 29:42.614
she would be dead.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.370
It was the worst day of my life.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.664
But you didn't come home
to find her dead, I did.

29:51.664 --> 29:55.043
You were supposed to be at practice,
you were always there until dark.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.754
- It was canceled.
- Yes. And I was stuck on a domestic.

29:57.754 --> 30:01.174
What the fuck was I supposed to do?
Not every movie is about you.

30:01.174 --> 30:04.427
- It was my mother!
- You made her death all about you.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.304
And your hatred to me.

30:06.304 --> 30:11.392
You couldn't let it go because without
your hatred to me, what were you, huh?

30:13.102 --> 30:14.020
What were you?

30:15.855 --> 30:19.108
And what you never saw
was your mother's agonizing--

30:19.108 --> 30:20.902
Pain. Yeah.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.320
- I did.
- Decision.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.031
Agonizing decision

30:26.074 --> 30:27.575
to let go.

30:30.161 --> 30:33.164
She said that I could do it,
that I was strong.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.543
- But you weren't.
No.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.047
I couldn't do it.

30:42.799 --> 30:46.386
Your mother,
she was the best person on earth.

30:46.386 --> 30:48.847
She did everything right,

30:48.847 --> 30:51.599
but it didn't matter
because there is no right

30:51.599 --> 30:53.434
and there is no wrong.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.981
And I never told you
that I was better than I was.

30:57.981 --> 31:02.026
I told you that you were better than me.
That's what I hoped for.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.864
I am what I am,
and to expect anything different,

31:05.864 --> 31:07.240
that was a mistake,

31:07.240 --> 31:08.491
and that's on you.

31:18.960 --> 31:19.961
Somebody else go.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.758
<i>Hi. This is Mike. Leave a message.</i>

31:25.758 --> 31:27.635
<i>You need to call me now.</i>

31:39.480 --> 31:40.523
Oh, shit.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.278
A lot of calls?

31:47.155 --> 31:49.782
Yeah. I should return some.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.453
Buzz and Ray-Ray finish up?

31:53.453 --> 31:55.622
Yeah, yeah. It's all set.

31:59.834 --> 32:00.877
Hey, maybe...

32:01.878 --> 32:04.297
Maybe we should get some lunch or...

32:05.381 --> 32:06.591
or a beer sometime?

32:07.300 --> 32:10.637
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we could do that.

32:12.388 --> 32:13.222
Okay.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.141
What are you doing here?

32:15.141 --> 32:17.185
You don't answer your phone. That's what.

32:17.185 --> 32:18.937
Sorry, we were in a thing.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.189
Oh, cool, that sounds fun.
I was in a thing too.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.941
My thing was your ex-wife is here.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.859
Shit, I know. Did she see you?

32:24.859 --> 32:27.028
- You know?
- How did you know who she was?

32:27.028 --> 32:28.237
We had a chat.

32:28.237 --> 32:31.032
<i>Let's stick to the part
where she knows who I am.</i>

32:31.032 --> 32:32.951
<i>So the first thing I'm doing
with the gold money</i>

32:32.951 --> 32:35.536
<i>is get plastic surgery,
so I'm not fucking killed.</i>

32:35.536 --> 32:38.122
I'm Iris. You mind?

32:40.375 --> 32:44.003
There's not gonna be any gold money
if she's around tonight.

32:44.003 --> 32:46.339
<i>No, I know,
I'll take care of Iris, don't worry.</i>

32:46.339 --> 32:48.174
I'm already doing it. Give me the key.

32:48.174 --> 32:50.551
I need to get her something
and she'll go away.

32:50.551 --> 32:52.887
Something?
Or that thing you said you didn't have?

32:53.763 --> 32:56.766
Yeah, kind of like the wife
you didn't say you had.

32:56.766 --> 32:59.519
You don't get to ask questions
at this particular moment.

33:03.856 --> 33:05.692
Why is there a stuffed dog in your room?

33:05.692 --> 33:07.902
- That's Bodie.
- You stuffed Bodie?

33:07.902 --> 33:10.863
- He was the best dog I ever had.
- Mom said you had buried him.

33:10.863 --> 33:14.200
No, she said he went to live with God,
but I don't believe in God.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.035
I believe in taxidermy.

33:24.043 --> 33:26.212
<i>Hey.</i>
- Hey, Iris.

33:26.212 --> 33:27.547
So you're in Florida.

33:27.547 --> 33:30.758
<i>Yeah, it's nice here.
I can see why you haven't left.</i>

33:30.758 --> 33:33.302
<i>Let's talk. You remember The Breakers?</i>

33:33.302 --> 33:34.387
See you there.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.359
Hey. It's gonna be fine. I promise.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.237
<i>So how are you?</i>
<i>I'm good.</i>

33:51.237 --> 33:52.155
I'm great.

33:52.155 --> 33:55.199
See? You don't have to come down here
to check up on me. I'm fine.

33:55.199 --> 33:58.661
Maybe, but when enough people
tell me I shouldn't be here,

33:58.661 --> 34:02.749
I start to think
here is exactly where I should be.

34:04.834 --> 34:07.086
So why are you?

34:07.879 --> 34:09.547
I'm here to kill someone, obviously.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.925
After killing Gil Franco, I had to bring
my murdering talents to Florida.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.430
I'll give you a minute with the menu.

34:21.768 --> 34:23.311
Someone killed Gil Franco.

34:23.311 --> 34:26.606
Yes, and it wasn't me and you know that.

34:26.606 --> 34:29.067
I told you already why I'm here.

34:29.984 --> 34:33.613
- Then you just keep lying to me.
- That's not true. I have not.

34:33.613 --> 34:35.531
Okay, where is Delly West?

34:38.743 --> 34:41.120
That one because I needed
to protect her. That's all.

34:41.120 --> 34:44.123
I just wanna know what you found
on Gil Franco's boat.

34:44.123 --> 34:45.625
The same as you.

34:46.709 --> 34:50.213
- Rifle cases with no rifles inside.
- So, what was he moving?

34:50.213 --> 34:53.257
- I don't know. I have no idea.
- None, Mike? Really?

34:53.966 --> 34:54.926
No.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.138
Really.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.185
Should we order?

35:05.520 --> 35:06.437
Yeah, sure.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.528
Sorry, they've called three times.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.321
- You mind if I take it?
- Please, take it.

35:15.321 --> 35:16.239
Okay.

35:19.617 --> 35:20.618
Who's this?

35:20.618 --> 35:22.078
<i>This is your partner.</i>

35:23.079 --> 35:23.996
Clara?

35:23.996 --> 35:25.414
We have a problem.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.750
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

35:27.750 --> 35:32.213
A man came here looking for you,
and now my husband has a hole in his head,

35:32.213 --> 35:34.507
and if we go to the hospital,
we'll get deported.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.134
Slow down. What man?

35:36.134 --> 35:37.593
<i>An asshole!</i>

35:37.593 --> 35:39.470
<i>Smells like Vicks VapoRub.</i>

35:59.490 --> 36:00.992
<i>♪ There is no light ♪</i>

36:02.827 --> 36:04.370
<i>♪ There is no charm... ♪</i>

36:04.370 --> 36:05.496
You're kidding me.

36:05.496 --> 36:07.832
- You did not say that.
- I did. It's true.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.710
There's no greater sports town
in the world than Philadelphia.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.795
- Chicago!
- It's not even in the conversation.

36:12.795 --> 36:15.173
Okay, how many titles of any kind

36:15.173 --> 36:17.758
has Philly won in the lifetime
of anyone living now?

36:17.758 --> 36:18.885
I mean, one.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.678
You can count the total on your dick.

36:20.678 --> 36:22.763
It would take two dicks,
thank you very much.

36:22.763 --> 36:25.933
But that's what makes a great sports town.
We don't have to win.

36:25.933 --> 36:27.268
Wow, that's a lucky break.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.687
We support our teams, live or die.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.523
You should go to Chicago sometime
and see what you're talking about.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.526
- I have. That's why I know.
- No. You have no idea.

36:35.526 --> 36:38.613
I was there one night.
Last time the Cubs won the division,

36:38.613 --> 36:40.198
what was it? A year ago.

36:40.198 --> 36:43.492
I drove through downtown that night,
not a single car on fire.

36:43.492 --> 36:46.913
A fan base that can't manage
to torch even one cop car

36:46.913 --> 36:48.539
is not committed to the cause.

36:57.006 --> 36:57.965
You okay?

36:58.382 --> 36:59.258
Hmm?

37:00.551 --> 37:01.636
Yeah.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.905
Hi, Delly.
