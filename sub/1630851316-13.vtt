WEBVTT

00:10.184 --> 00:12.055
It's all so beautiful, isn't it?

00:12.229 --> 00:14.536
It is.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.669
But this isn't right.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.106
What do you mean?

00:19.280 --> 00:21.717
I want to be here, but...

00:21.891 --> 00:24.459
it isn't time for this yet,
is it? It can't be.

00:24.633 --> 00:27.070
You're right.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.463
It isn't.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.508
So open your eyes.

00:30.682 --> 00:33.337
I don't... I don't understand.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.252
Open them, Jimmy.

00:35.426 --> 00:37.298
You need to move.

00:37.472 --> 00:39.256
I want to, it's just...

00:39.430 --> 00:41.911
this year's been so hard.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.173
I miss you so much.

00:45.697 --> 00:48.918
And I miss you, but not that.

00:49.092 --> 00:51.573
You need you to move now,
so I know you're alive.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.357
Open your eyes.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.586
Kasie.

01:04.716 --> 01:06.501
Kasie.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.841
For the millionth time,
I'm-I'm doing great.

01:42.972 --> 01:45.105
The fight was a-a month ago.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.323
Yeah, no,
I'll admit your face

01:46.497 --> 01:48.195
looks better,
but besides that?

01:48.369 --> 01:50.197
Besides that, my face
doesn't just look better,

01:50.371 --> 01:52.764
it looks perfect.

01:52.938 --> 01:54.505
That's all
that matters.

01:54.636 --> 01:55.898
And I believe
you know these guys.

01:56.072 --> 01:57.334
McWhoa!
Oh!

01:57.508 --> 01:59.423
Victoria. Hey, hon.
What a nice surprise.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.164
Hey, Uncle Tim.

02:01.338 --> 02:02.600
Crown Vic.

02:02.774 --> 02:03.775
Uncle Nick!

02:06.735 --> 02:09.520
That one hurt.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.174
So, wait, what is this?
Is this, uh,

02:11.348 --> 02:12.871
bring your daughter
to work day already?

02:13.002 --> 02:15.222
Not exactly.

02:15.396 --> 02:17.180
Well, you are my daughter,
and this is where I work, so...

02:17.354 --> 02:20.227
Okay, now hold on,
don't tell me...

02:20.401 --> 02:22.359
Could you be the famous
Victoria Palmer

02:22.533 --> 02:24.231
that I've been
hearing about?

02:24.405 --> 02:26.189
She's been hearing a lot
about you, too, Agent Knight.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.148
- Victoria?
- Nice to meet you, Agent Knight.

02:28.322 --> 02:29.758
Jess, please. And...

02:29.932 --> 02:31.629
I love your shoes.

02:31.803 --> 02:34.328
And I-I love
that backpack, too.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.591
Thanks.
So cute.

02:39.637 --> 02:42.336
And over here, we have...

02:42.466 --> 02:44.642
When did Gibbs
grow a beard?

02:44.816 --> 02:46.644
Oh.
No, no, actually...

02:46.818 --> 02:48.603
No, Victoria,

02:48.777 --> 02:52.215
this is, uh, Special Agent
Parker. I told you about--

02:52.346 --> 02:54.435
Okay. You got me.
You--

02:54.609 --> 02:55.784
She's been
- pulling our legs.
- Yeah.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.221
A real chip off
Dad's block, huh?

02:58.395 --> 03:01.181
Oh, you have no idea.

03:01.355 --> 03:02.704
Ow.

03:02.878 --> 03:05.228
I mean, you know
you tell corny jokes.

03:05.402 --> 03:07.012
My jokes are not corny.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.363
Uh, hate to break up the party,

03:09.493 --> 03:11.016
but, uh, that
was Quantico.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.802
We've got a dead... You can say it.

03:13.932 --> 03:16.065
I'm fairly well-versed
in dead body talk.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.806
It's true, she was raised on it.

03:17.936 --> 03:20.330
Oh. Well, yeah,
we have a dead body.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.245
Apparently, the victim
of some kind of

03:22.419 --> 03:24.595
- truck accident.
- That's terrible.

03:24.726 --> 03:25.857
Can I come?

03:26.031 --> 03:27.207
No, you are gonna
hang here

03:27.381 --> 03:28.599
with Aunt Kasie
until we get back.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.427
Excellent.
Be careful, everybody.

03:31.907 --> 03:32.821
Her new catchphrase.

03:36.303 --> 03:39.393
Yo. What's with
all the baby talk?

03:39.523 --> 03:41.308
What baby talk?

03:47.227 --> 03:50.142
Man, what a way to go.

03:50.317 --> 03:51.535
See, now that's your real voice.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.537
Okay, enough.

03:53.711 --> 03:56.540
I told you I am not a natural
when it comes to children.

03:56.714 --> 03:58.499
But what about that
Paper Pauline thing

03:58.673 --> 04:00.501
that you did for,
uh, your niece?

04:00.675 --> 04:03.068
Oh, I'm a great
long-distance aunt.

04:03.199 --> 04:05.723
When it comes to the
one-on-one, I don't know.

04:05.897 --> 04:08.552
I just don't know how
to relate or what to say.

04:08.726 --> 04:11.468
You know, kids are
like small people.

04:11.642 --> 04:14.210
You just talk to them
like people.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.343
Driver says he came out
of nowhere.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.345
Ah, he's wedged up
in there pretty good.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.911
Any idea how to
get him out?

04:20.085 --> 04:21.739
Well, we either back
the truck up a couple of feet

04:21.913 --> 04:23.524
or we take
the wheel off completely.

04:23.698 --> 04:26.614
Uh, no need for a jack.
Allow me.

04:26.788 --> 04:30.531
Oh, yeah, Torres, just, uh, back
it up a foot or so, and, um,

04:30.705 --> 04:32.359
you guys might want
to look away.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.186
Like we haven't seen everything?

04:34.361 --> 04:35.710
Yeah, nothing
we can't handle, Jimmy.

04:35.884 --> 04:38.060
Ready?

04:38.234 --> 04:39.322
Yeah, Nick, uh,
nice and slow.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.063
Easy, Nick.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.108
Uh, easy, easy. Oh.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.414
Ooh... Whoa.
Oh, God.

04:48.592 --> 04:49.811
Can't unsee that.

04:49.985 --> 04:51.639
Yeah, we should've
used the jack.

04:53.118 --> 04:55.164
Got an ID here.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.688
Great. Please,
change the subject.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.908
Victim is
Philip Hanch, 32,

05:00.038 --> 05:01.866
former Army Private
First Class.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.391
So, not a Marine.

05:04.565 --> 05:05.827
Well, maybe he was
visiting the base.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.568
If he was,
he wasn't invited.

05:07.742 --> 05:08.699
Security just
found a breach.

05:08.873 --> 05:11.528
Wire cutters.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.356
Found next to a brand-new
four-foot hole

05:13.530 --> 05:14.836
cut into the outer fence.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.490
Mc
And according to this,

05:16.664 --> 05:19.275
Hanch was dishonorably
discharged in 2014.

05:19.449 --> 05:20.711
Plus, he's got a record here.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.365
Criminal trespassing,
drunk and disorderly.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.889
So, we got a dead intruder
who was up to...

05:25.063 --> 05:27.283
what, exactly?

05:27.414 --> 05:29.503
Nothing good,
I'm guessing.

05:37.119 --> 05:39.382
So, our victim,

05:39.513 --> 05:41.297
Philip Hanch,
was something of a...

05:41.471 --> 05:43.212
Hold on, are we still
calling him a "victim"?

05:43.386 --> 05:45.040
Of the truck, yes.

05:45.214 --> 05:47.172
Until we know why
he broke into Quantico.

05:47.303 --> 05:48.826
Well, I was about to
call him a slacker.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.350
Since being kicked out
of the Army,

05:50.524 --> 05:52.090
he hasn't held a regular job

05:52.264 --> 05:54.441
or paid any taxes since 2016.

05:54.615 --> 05:55.964
Same year he got divorced,

05:56.094 --> 05:58.270
and his ex-wife
is his only next of kin.

05:58.445 --> 05:59.533
Though he did manage to make

05:59.663 --> 06:01.491
a few car payments
the last few years.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.406
So, he had to be
making money somehow.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.887
Making it and losing it
just as fast.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.454
According to this,
Hanch was yet another

06:07.628 --> 06:10.021
dabbler in cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin?

06:10.195 --> 06:11.327
Ethereum?

06:11.458 --> 06:13.024
Mc
In his dreams.

06:13.198 --> 06:14.852
Hanch played most every
new start-up token;

06:14.983 --> 06:16.245
each link in the blockchain
blew up in his face.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.073
English, please?

06:18.247 --> 06:20.858
Basically, he was gambling
to get rich quick.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.600
- Only ended up with about $50
- K in credit card debt.

06:23.774 --> 06:25.210
Why couldn't he
just say that?

06:25.341 --> 06:26.647
Mc
Digging now to see
if that debt

06:26.821 --> 06:27.909
has any connection to Quantico. Good.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.215
And, uh, back
to this ex-wife.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.130
Already notified.
She's on her way.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.397
And Jimmy Palmer needs us
down in Autopsy.

06:37.571 --> 06:39.268
By all means,
lead the way,

06:39.442 --> 06:41.966
and if I haven't said it lately,
you guys are good.

06:48.799 --> 06:50.061
Crown Vic.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.499
What happened?
No more, uh, Kasie time?

06:52.673 --> 06:54.849
She got busy, so, yeah,
back to Dad.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.807
And what are you up to, Nick?

06:58.722 --> 07:01.029
Oh, I was just about
to go to this, uh,

07:01.203 --> 07:02.204
new, uh, ice cream shop

07:02.378 --> 07:04.467
just up the road,
but, you know,

07:04.598 --> 07:05.947
with the case and allAh.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.165
You got some time.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.430
I don't suppose
you're interested.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.606
Ice cream or autopsy?

07:12.736 --> 07:13.868
Tough call.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.870
All right.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.393
Rocky road it is.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.917
Thanks, Nick.

07:20.091 --> 07:23.443
I'm guessing there are some
things you'd rather she not see.

07:23.617 --> 07:26.402
Yeah. This is definitely
one of them.

07:30.101 --> 07:33.453
Any clues in that mess
that might help us?

07:33.627 --> 07:35.106
Uh, it's just
personal items so far.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.503
SIM card on that phone any good?

07:40.677 --> 07:42.984
Well, Kasie'll tell us for sure,

07:43.158 --> 07:44.986
but it seems to be just
as crushed as everything else.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.640
Everything,
that is, except for

07:46.770 --> 07:49.730
this little flask
that somehow survived.

07:49.860 --> 07:53.124
I hope the guy managed a last
sip before he got steamrolled.

07:53.298 --> 07:55.213
We're sorry for your loss, <i>
Mrs. Hanch.</i>

07:55.387 --> 07:57.215
I can't say
I'm all that surprised.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.087
That your ex-husbandis dead?

07:59.217 --> 08:02.569
The way Phil was headed,

08:02.743 --> 08:04.440
guess I had a feeling
that this day was coming.

08:04.614 --> 08:06.311
What can you tell me about him?

08:06.442 --> 08:08.966
I thought I was
marrying a...

08:09.140 --> 08:11.273
nature-loving
free spirit,

08:11.447 --> 08:12.970
only to realize
that he

08:13.144 --> 08:15.016
was just a man
with no plan.

08:15.146 --> 08:17.322
And no job.

08:17.453 --> 08:19.977
He was just
always searching.

08:20.151 --> 08:22.719
Looking for answers
outside of himself.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.028
It's what led him
to these fringe groups.

08:27.202 --> 08:29.552
Any that you know of
specifically?

08:29.726 --> 08:31.380
No.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.469
Just the kind that
get people like Phil

08:33.643 --> 08:35.515
caught up in
conspiracy theories.

08:35.689 --> 08:39.257
And all they ever did
was just make him...

08:39.431 --> 08:41.608
make him mad at the world.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.001
Any idea where he was living?

08:44.175 --> 08:45.568
I know exactly where.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.831
Four Pines Trailer Park

08:48.005 --> 08:50.051
in Reston.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.488
I know because I sent money

08:52.619 --> 08:54.142
a few times to help him
pay for it.

08:55.622 --> 08:56.710
But...

08:58.407 --> 09:00.409
I guess I wasn't
helping at all.

09:00.583 --> 09:03.238
Just enabling him
to go further down

09:03.412 --> 09:04.631
that rabbit hole to Crazy Town.

09:07.459 --> 09:10.288
Whew. Don't know what you're
feeding that girl, but she

09:10.462 --> 09:12.552
- is growing so fast.
- Maybe not in a good way.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.772
Excuse me?
That is my play niece.

09:15.946 --> 09:17.382
She didn't tell you
why she's here today

09:17.513 --> 09:18.514
instead of at school, did she?

09:18.645 --> 09:20.037
She called it
a mental health day.

09:20.211 --> 09:23.519
Not for my mental health.
She got suspended

09:23.693 --> 09:25.652
- for fighting.
- Our Victoria?

09:25.826 --> 09:27.828
Yeah. Her teacher said
it was just a scuffle,

09:28.002 --> 09:29.307
and she doesn't deny it,
but she won't tell me

09:29.481 --> 09:31.048
why or how it happened.

09:31.222 --> 09:32.397
All kids go through phases.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.399
I'm sure this
is just that.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.400
Hey.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.880
What's all this?

09:37.054 --> 09:38.316
Isn't this
your contract renewal?

09:38.490 --> 09:40.710
What? Oh, that. Yeah.

09:40.884 --> 09:41.972
Yeah, Vance wanted this
last week.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.714
Yeah. I just... Ah.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.498
I-I've been so busy,
I just hadn't

09:46.673 --> 09:48.675
- gotten around to it.
- Yeah, but you will, won't you?

09:50.502 --> 09:53.854
I have always wanted
one of these.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.986
Ah, don't change the subject.

09:56.117 --> 09:59.163
No, no, I'm not. I'm working.
Any guesses?

09:59.337 --> 10:00.643
Scotch?

10:00.817 --> 10:02.645
Hm, bourbon?

10:04.778 --> 10:06.780
Uh, vodka, maybe?
I don't know. I don't...

10:06.910 --> 10:08.129
Hm...

10:08.303 --> 10:10.348
Oh, yeah, give Mass Spec a shot.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.654
Okay.

10:11.828 --> 10:12.742
That'll tell us
what it is.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.971
NCI-- Aye, aye.

10:24.145 --> 10:26.800
Whoa.

10:26.930 --> 10:29.063
Whoa.

10:29.237 --> 10:31.152
Ugh.

10:31.326 --> 10:33.850
Almost as gross
as his body.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.896
Mc
Well, this is quite the mess.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.379
Back here.

10:44.687 --> 10:47.124
I'm thinking...
private evil lair.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.607
Complete with his very
own private evil journal.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.914
Looks like our guy's
been busy.

10:54.044 --> 10:56.177
Except that's not
our guy's handwriting.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.266
"With righteous vengeance,

10:58.396 --> 11:00.398
"may the Unkindness

11:00.572 --> 11:02.096
"cast our own plague

11:02.270 --> 11:04.185
upon the prophets of war."

11:04.359 --> 11:05.316
Sounds like a manifesto to me.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.840
Targeting Quantico.

11:09.364 --> 11:10.582
"And let this

11:10.757 --> 11:13.150
"display our power
toward the glory

11:13.324 --> 11:15.631
of Nevermore."

11:15.805 --> 11:19.026
Definitely cult speak.
What's the "Unkindness"?

11:19.200 --> 11:20.984
I have no idea,
but whoever wrote this garbage

11:21.158 --> 11:22.159
signed it appropriately.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.944
Mc
Quoth the Raven.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.337
So he's a big Edgar Allan Poe
fan, but, uh...

11:26.511 --> 11:28.209
what's this
about a plague?

11:28.339 --> 11:29.819
Maybe this?

11:36.086 --> 11:38.654
Kind of odd that that
container's only half full.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.264
So where's
the other half?

11:42.223 --> 11:46.053
Relax, Jimmy. I'm just saying
I'll sign it when I'm ready.

11:46.227 --> 11:48.577
And all I'm saying is that HR
could be weird about deadlines.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.187
If you don't sign
your contract on time...

11:50.361 --> 11:52.973
Look, maybe I'm
looking for a sign

11:53.103 --> 11:56.237
on whether or not to re-up
for another five years.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.721
Ooh-- What the heck?

12:01.895 --> 12:05.855
Oh... that's never a good sound.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.162
- Agent Parker?
- The flask, Jimmy.

12:08.336 --> 12:09.903
- Don't open it.
- What?

12:10.077 --> 12:11.513
Code 2 alert.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.167
Biohazard detected.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.430
Biohazard containment
protocols initiated.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.519
Okay, what is happening?

12:17.693 --> 12:19.216
Automatic lockdown.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.741
The flask contains
some kind of biotoxin

12:21.915 --> 12:24.047
Mass Spec
does not like.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.833
I'm guessing this isn't the sign
you were looking for.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.234
What is it? Two-two bumps
and a, and a slap?

12:37.408 --> 12:38.975
No.

12:39.149 --> 12:40.063
Agent Torres.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.239
Oh, hey, Director.

12:42.413 --> 12:43.588
Is that
Victoria Palmer?

12:43.719 --> 12:45.590
Hi, Director.
Just visiting.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.854
How nice.
It's good to see you again.

12:48.028 --> 12:51.422
Agent Torres,
did you, uh, receive the

12:51.596 --> 12:54.077
Code 2 alert
on Ms. Hines's lab?

12:54.251 --> 12:57.298
Code 2? That's a lockdown.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.387
What lockdown?

12:59.517 --> 13:00.780
Mc
Was anybody besides

13:00.954 --> 13:02.433
Jimmy and Kasie exposed?

13:02.607 --> 13:04.218
Why is there a lockdown?

13:07.438 --> 13:09.179
Are Kasie and my dad
in trouble?

13:09.353 --> 13:12.487
No. No, no, no, Victoria. See,
uh, Mass Spec is-is programmed

13:12.661 --> 13:13.793
to do that automatically.

13:16.056 --> 13:16.926
Something bad happened,
didn't it?

13:19.624 --> 13:21.496
I want to see my dad.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.498
And how do we
make that happen?

13:23.672 --> 13:26.022
Well, uh, Kasie's lab
is sealed up,

13:26.196 --> 13:28.111
so her office
is safe.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.547
She could talk to him
- through the glass doors.
- Good.

13:29.678 --> 13:30.679
Can we?

13:30.853 --> 13:32.768
Hell yeah.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.204
Come on,
let's go.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.775
Okay, first, we need
to get whatever Kasie

13:39.949 --> 13:42.691
identified in that flask
over to CDC for analysis.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.172
Already done. Mass Spec
does that automatically.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.609
Great. Also, we need
anything we can find on this,

13:47.783 --> 13:49.916
uh, Raven creep.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.179
And as far as
Jimmy and Kasie go,

13:52.353 --> 13:54.659
I don't suppose we have a good
toxicologist on speed dial.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.096
Actually, we do.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.575
CDC's sending her now.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.664
One of their top experts
in biotoxins.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.362
Who's he
talking about?

14:01.536 --> 14:04.060
Uh, an old friend,
and a good one.

14:05.757 --> 14:08.673
The next thing we know,
Mass Spec is wailing

14:08.804 --> 14:10.893
and every door in here
just slammed shut.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.895
Hey, at least we know the system works.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.810
Yeah, maybe a little too well.
I mean, as you can see,

14:14.941 --> 14:16.594
sweetheart,
we are both fine.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.553
And what

14:18.727 --> 14:21.382
fine mess have we gotten
ourselves into this time, Jimmy?

14:21.556 --> 14:23.514
Hey, Carol!

14:23.688 --> 14:24.864
You guys went straight
to the top.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.735
Hey, for you and Kasie,
only the best.

14:28.128 --> 14:30.521
Torres, right?
Yes.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.045
I hear good things.

14:32.175 --> 14:33.960
And they're all true.
And you are?

14:34.134 --> 14:36.049
Nick!

14:36.223 --> 14:40.488
Do you seriously not know
Dr. Carol Wilson? Oh, my gosh!

14:40.662 --> 14:42.882
- You never told me you know her.
- You never told me you know her.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.448
Oh, my gosh, Dr. Wilson--
Excuse me.

14:44.622 --> 14:47.669
Dr. Wilson, um, I so

14:47.843 --> 14:49.976
admire your work.

14:50.150 --> 14:53.370
M-My college dissertation was
all about your Ebola research.

14:53.544 --> 14:56.373
Carol, please. That is so sweet

14:56.547 --> 14:59.376
and doesn't make me
feel old at all.

14:59.550 --> 15:00.464
And you...

15:00.638 --> 15:02.118
I'm Victoria.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.992
Come on, Jimmy. Are you serious?

15:06.166 --> 15:08.472
You mean to tell me that this
beautiful young lady is your

15:08.646 --> 15:10.561
baby Victoria?

15:10.735 --> 15:12.912
Man, I swear, between her
and McGee's twins,

15:13.086 --> 15:14.435
time is just flying by.

15:14.609 --> 15:17.003
Um, speaking of time, Carol...

15:17.177 --> 15:20.093
Nice segue, McGee.
Okay, here's the deal.

15:20.223 --> 15:22.095
Until we have more information,

15:22.269 --> 15:23.923
protocols call for the two
of you to sit tight in there.

15:24.097 --> 15:25.968
Now, I admit
I am not familiar

15:26.142 --> 15:27.404
with this compound
that you inhaled,

15:27.578 --> 15:30.451
but it seems similar
to a VX-type gas.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.192
And I already have
two calls in to my friend,

15:32.366 --> 15:33.889
Yuri Pastov.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.891
Didn't Pastov create

15:36.065 --> 15:37.545
some of these biotoxins
to begin with?

15:37.675 --> 15:39.199
Yes, until he defected
to the U.S.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.375
last year to create
some antidotes.

15:41.549 --> 15:44.639
Look, if anybody
can help us, Yuri can.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.771
Then they're
going to be okay?

15:46.902 --> 15:49.209
Don't you worry at all, okay?

15:49.383 --> 15:51.298
Your job is to make sure
that Dad and Kasie

15:51.472 --> 15:53.126
don't drive each other crazy
in there until I can get back.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.215
Okay?

16:01.134 --> 16:02.396
All right, ice cream check.
What'd you get?

16:02.570 --> 16:04.006
Rocky road.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.660
Rocky road. How many scoops?

16:05.834 --> 16:09.490
Unkindness, McGee.
Care to guess?

16:09.664 --> 16:11.231
No time for guessing.
What is it?

16:11.361 --> 16:13.711
It's what bird people call
a group of ravens.

16:13.885 --> 16:14.974
- Mc
- Meaning Hanch wasn't acting alone.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.801
Meaning he's
part of a flock

16:16.932 --> 16:17.933
that's doing whatever
this Raven tells them to.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.240
Look, I lied in there.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.372
Jimmy and Kasie
are in very big trouble.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.026
If it's the toxin
that I think it is,

16:24.200 --> 16:25.854
the ill effects are
merely delayed right how,

16:26.028 --> 16:27.247
but they are quite deadly.

16:27.421 --> 16:28.770
What about Dr. Pastov?

16:28.944 --> 16:30.424
He's yet to return my call,

16:30.598 --> 16:31.860
so who's coming with me
to find him?

16:32.034 --> 16:33.905
Where are we looking?

16:34.080 --> 16:36.082
He's working out of
a research lab in Norfolk.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.257
If we leave now,
we can probably... McOh, no need.

16:37.431 --> 16:39.824
We can put you there
in five minutes.

16:41.913 --> 16:44.525
Thank you for joining us
on short notice, Mr. Elroy.

16:44.699 --> 16:46.918
This is Special Agent Parker
and this...

16:47.093 --> 16:50.400
Everyone knows the great
Carol Wilson, Director.

16:50.574 --> 16:53.751
I understand you were hoping
to see Dr. Pastov?

16:53.925 --> 16:55.057
At his earliest convenience.

16:55.231 --> 16:56.972
As early as now would be good.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.453
I'm sure, but may I ask why?

16:59.627 --> 17:01.716
Depends. Why do you ask?

17:01.890 --> 17:03.848
What exactly do you do,
Mr. Elroy?

17:03.979 --> 17:05.850
We are a civilian lab,

17:06.025 --> 17:08.157
but we're contracted by the CDC

17:08.331 --> 17:11.508
to develop toxin antidotes
with Dr. Pastov.

17:11.682 --> 17:15.251
Which again begs the question,
where is he?

17:16.992 --> 17:19.342
I'm afraid he...

17:19.516 --> 17:22.476
fell off the grid
two days ago. Um...

17:22.650 --> 17:25.087
No one at his place,
no answers on his cell.

17:25.261 --> 17:26.567
And no missing persons report.

17:26.741 --> 17:27.785
For two whole days?

17:27.959 --> 17:28.830
We're quite capable

17:29.004 --> 17:30.136
of handling this in-house.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.007
I'm sure he's fine.

17:32.181 --> 17:33.922
Quit trying to save
your contract. Who's got him?

17:34.096 --> 17:35.663
The Russians?

17:35.837 --> 17:37.969
Doubtful.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.755
The toxin was created
in Russia,

17:40.929 --> 17:42.278
but the terror threat

17:42.452 --> 17:44.759
that brought Pastov
to the States is apparently

17:44.933 --> 17:46.761
domestic in nature.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.676
And knowing there's
a terror threat,

17:48.850 --> 17:50.504
did you notify anyone?

17:50.678 --> 17:53.681
Sounds bad, I admit,
but the good news is

17:53.811 --> 17:55.683
Pastov was successful.
He has the antidote.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.946
Wherever he is.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.557
That would be the bad news, yes.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.733
Okay, you listen to me
right now. I want every piece

18:02.907 --> 18:04.953
of Pastov's research.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.390
Every note, every formula.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.131
Well, that might take some time.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.090
That's time
we don't have, jagoff!

18:11.264 --> 18:13.135
Parker... You give the good doctor

18:13.266 --> 18:15.964
anything she needs,
or we're gonna have your ass.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.706
Okay, no need for that.

18:18.836 --> 18:21.361
Just stay on the line.
I'll be right back.

18:30.152 --> 18:33.199
Say hello to my rainbow grenade.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.375
Watch this jump.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.290
That's not even
a jump. That's a hop.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.161
That was a jump.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.554
They seem to be close.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.470
It all started out
as Nick giving me time

18:43.644 --> 18:45.602
to visit Breena's grave
and r-run some errands.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.822
Even last month, when he was
going through his tough time,

18:47.996 --> 18:49.389
that lone wolf
in there,

18:49.563 --> 18:52.348
he showed up to hang out
with Victoria every Saturday.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.611
They have a
real connection.

18:54.785 --> 18:55.873
Sounds like he enjoys
their "Saturdates"

18:56.004 --> 18:57.005
as much as she does.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.180
Yeah, I-I get the feeling that,

18:58.354 --> 18:59.877
you know, she opens up

19:00.051 --> 19:01.314
more to him than she does
to me, especially lately.

19:01.444 --> 19:03.446
Wish I could hear
what they're saying.

19:03.620 --> 19:06.971
Ooh, I can grant you that wish.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.321
It wasn't like that at all.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.713
Oh, great. W-Wait.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.020
Are we spying?
Yes.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.108
I mean, it's not like
I walked up

19:13.239 --> 19:14.979
to the kid and
just punched him.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.807
Okay, so how
did it happen?

19:16.981 --> 19:18.983
We were playing "Monster
in the Gym" during recess and...

19:19.114 --> 19:20.159
Hey, guys.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.769
Was just checking on you,

19:21.899 --> 19:23.597
but I see that
you're playing a...

19:23.771 --> 19:25.425
super cool game,
so I'm just gonna go.

19:25.599 --> 19:28.123
Vic was just telling me about

19:28.297 --> 19:29.777
this fight that she
got into in school.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.997
I didn't call it a fight.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.738
I mean, you did say that
you were playing "Monster."

19:34.912 --> 19:35.739
Yeah.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.437
And this big kid, Josh,

19:37.611 --> 19:39.134
grabbed me and wouldn't let go.

19:39.308 --> 19:41.658
You and Dad always let go
when we play Monster,

19:41.832 --> 19:43.921
but every time I said stop,

19:44.052 --> 19:46.185
Josh just grabbed me tighter,

19:46.359 --> 19:48.448
until I got scared
and punched him.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.189
Sounds to me like
he had it coming, then.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.886
I don't know.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.671
Dad says I should never
resort to violence.

19:54.802 --> 19:57.587
No, your dad's right.
Punching isn't the answer.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.676
Next time Josh

19:59.850 --> 20:01.852
or anyone does this,

20:02.026 --> 20:04.464
try thrusting the palm
of your hand up into his nose.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.161
It'll blind them
for a couple of seconds,

20:06.335 --> 20:07.597
which is much better
than a punch.

20:07.728 --> 20:09.208
- Mm-hmm.
- Nice. That's what I'm talking about.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.646
Uh...

20:12.820 --> 20:15.736
Is that really the lesson
we're trying to teach her?

20:15.910 --> 20:18.652
Well, it's vital that she knows
how to protect herself,

20:18.826 --> 20:21.307
and it's never too early
to learn about consent.

20:21.481 --> 20:23.613
Plus, you told me to talk to her
like a person.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.703
I didn't tell you to...

20:26.877 --> 20:28.227
Why wouldn't Vic tell me
about that? Hey, hey.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.750
I was listening.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.186
You've heard enough,
and so have I.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.753
- Kasie.
- Jimmy!

20:32.927 --> 20:35.451
We have way more
pressing concerns right now,

20:35.625 --> 20:36.887
and I'm starting to get
a little antsy.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.498
A little antsy? You...

20:38.672 --> 20:40.761
We need to do something.

20:40.935 --> 20:42.415
Okay. Y-You're right,
you're right, you're right.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.504
Um...

20:44.678 --> 20:46.070
What?

20:48.638 --> 20:51.641
Not one word in these
psychotic Raven ramblings

20:51.772 --> 20:55.341
about the number of followers
in his little cult.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.778
I was able to pull
some partial prints here.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.084
Hopefully give us a few
new names to work with.

21:00.215 --> 21:01.564
Yeah, without Kasie,
I'll have to call in a favor

21:01.738 --> 21:03.479
at the FBI
to check AFIS.

21:03.653 --> 21:04.480
Well, maybe not.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.352
Kasie texted.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.658
Said if we can get
clear enough shots

21:08.789 --> 21:11.226
with a camera, she can run
the prints through AFIS herself.

21:14.969 --> 21:18.146
Grab the tincture, add
just two drops of the tropine

21:18.320 --> 21:20.104
to the tropic acid
before introducing

21:20.235 --> 21:21.541
the hydrochloric acid.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.325
Are we sure
about injecting acid?

21:23.456 --> 21:25.327
It won't be acid
once we're done with it.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.111
The antidote
to standard VX

21:27.286 --> 21:28.722
is atropine,
which we don't have,

21:28.896 --> 21:30.550
but what we do have

21:30.680 --> 21:31.942
is three ingredients
to make it ourselves.

21:32.116 --> 21:33.988
I-I just-- I don't know
if it's gonna work.

21:34.162 --> 21:34.945
Okay, I don't know either!

21:35.119 --> 21:36.817
Do you have
another idea?

21:36.991 --> 21:40.516
Anything at all? Okay,
this cannot be our third strike.

21:40.690 --> 21:43.345
Okay, there it is!
That-that dreaded

21:43.519 --> 21:45.304
third strike that you're
always waiting for.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.741
Well, then what the hell
would you call it?

21:47.915 --> 21:50.744
Okay? I have been shot at,
I've had a knife to my throat,

21:50.918 --> 21:53.486
and now it's toxic gas
for the win.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.053
Just stop it! Just-just...
j-just stop it.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.752
Carol said we are gonna be fine,
so everything's gonna be fine.

21:58.926 --> 22:01.363
And you believe her?

22:01.494 --> 22:03.800
Look at us, Jimmy.
D-Do you feel fine?

22:03.931 --> 22:06.412
No, I-I... I don't feel fine,
no, but I-I do know

22:06.586 --> 22:08.065
that freaking out about it is
only gonna make things worse.

22:08.239 --> 22:09.589
Okay, you know what?
Spare me your constant

22:09.763 --> 22:11.939
glass-half-full routine,

22:12.069 --> 22:14.158
when all I can think about
- is my imminent death!
- All right,

22:14.289 --> 22:16.291
if you do me a favor
and maybe you stop thinking

22:16.465 --> 22:18.902
about it so loudly with my
daughter in the very next room!

22:27.215 --> 22:29.652
She can't hear you, but I can.

22:29.826 --> 22:32.612
And both of you need
to chill the hell out.

22:32.742 --> 22:34.178
It's not their fault.
The toxin's

22:34.309 --> 22:35.441
probably causing
an adrenaline surge.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.617
Carol. Didn't see you there.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.053
How long have you
been listening?

22:39.227 --> 22:41.882
Long enough to say,
knock it off.

22:42.056 --> 22:44.667
In fact, I want you
to stop anything

22:44.841 --> 22:46.016
and everything that's gonna
elevate your blood pressures,

22:46.190 --> 22:48.323
especially arguing.

22:48.497 --> 22:50.412
- We weren't arguing.
- Yes, we were.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.109
It was a chemically-induced
- argument. It doesn't count.
- Oh, my God.

22:52.283 --> 22:54.590
It's only gonna make
the toxins circulate faster.

22:54.764 --> 22:56.331
So if you don't slow down,

22:56.505 --> 22:58.594
fatality can occur within hours

22:58.768 --> 23:01.554
of the first onset
of physical symptoms.

23:01.728 --> 23:05.340
Well, luckily, we haven't had
any physical symptoms yet.

23:05.514 --> 23:08.996
So, I mean, nothing
to worry about, right?

23:09.170 --> 23:10.345
Oh, no.

23:14.915 --> 23:16.351
Oh, my God, Jimmy.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.571
Kasie.

23:27.231 --> 23:28.624
Jimmy's nose is bleeding.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.017
Meaning what?

23:30.147 --> 23:31.714
It means we now have just

23:31.888 --> 23:33.368
two and a half hours
to find Raven, Pastov,

23:33.499 --> 23:34.848
and most importantly,
the antidote.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.676
So what do we have so far?

23:36.806 --> 23:38.591
Wait a minute. What happens
in two and a half hours?

23:38.721 --> 23:40.723
What do we have?

23:40.897 --> 23:43.509
Partial prints Kasie ran
through AFIS narrowed

23:43.683 --> 23:45.162
our search down to
about 6,500 people.

23:45.336 --> 23:46.903
I've gone through
Hanch's social media,

23:47.077 --> 23:48.905
pulled IP addresses
from the more active posters.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.429
Now, I ran geolocations.

23:50.603 --> 23:51.821
Tech Trolls are
cross-referencing those

23:51.952 --> 23:53.475
with the AFIS list.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.303
Said they'd get back
to us if they get a hit.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.523
- Hmm.
- And they found something.

23:57.697 --> 23:59.525
All right,
we got an address here.

23:59.699 --> 24:01.048
Does not necessarily mean

24:01.178 --> 24:02.615
it's the Raven's
place, but...

24:02.745 --> 24:04.007
No buts. We're going either way.

24:07.402 --> 24:10.536
According
to Pastov's notes, X-18

24:10.710 --> 24:12.755
is much different
than VX gas. In fact,

24:12.929 --> 24:16.106
the only similarity is
they can both be lethal.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.979
Are we sure?
Even with a standard VX,

24:19.153 --> 24:23.157
we'd have much worse than
bloody noses and a short temper.

24:23.331 --> 24:24.941
It is a pretty
bad bloody nose.

24:25.072 --> 24:27.204
Well, maybe we didn't get
exposed to that high a dose.

24:27.378 --> 24:29.903
You said
that fatality can occur,

24:30.077 --> 24:32.079
but maybe in this case,
it won't.

24:32.253 --> 24:34.777
Well, we certainly hope
that that's the case, but we...

24:34.951 --> 24:36.692
There's got to be something
that we can try, right?

24:36.866 --> 24:39.129
We managed
to synthesize atropine.

24:39.303 --> 24:40.870
Atropine will have no effect.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.959
So why? What?
You're-you're telling us

24:43.090 --> 24:44.700
that we're supposed to just,
like, sit in this box

24:44.874 --> 24:46.310
and wait to die
in a couple of hours?

24:46.485 --> 24:48.443
Jimmy... Jimmy, what?

24:48.617 --> 24:50.967
No. If I only have a couple
hours left to live, I'm sorry.

24:51.098 --> 24:52.926
I'm not about to spend it
in this lab. No offense, Kase.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.537
Jimmy, what are you doing?

24:55.668 --> 24:57.974
The toxins must have been
scrubbed through the filtration

24:58.105 --> 24:59.889
system by now, all right?
So I'm gonna decontaminate.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.762
I'll-I'll shower off,
I'll change my clothes,

25:02.892 --> 25:04.415
and I'll spend the last
few hours of my life

25:04.590 --> 25:06.896
with my daughter,
if you don't mind.

25:07.070 --> 25:10.552
If you open that door, you will
be killing your daughter, too.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.554
<i>This is not VX</i> <i>
we're dealing with.</i>

25:12.685 --> 25:14.817
<i>The lack of symptoms is</i> <i>
by design.</i>

25:14.991 --> 25:16.776
If you two were out
in the world,

25:16.906 --> 25:18.995
you would have already
contaminated countless people

25:19.169 --> 25:21.476
before feeling the ill effects yourselves.

25:21.650 --> 25:26.786
This a perfect biological weapon
with a 100% mortality rate.

25:26.916 --> 25:30.050
I'm sorry. I wasn't upfront
with you sooner

25:30.224 --> 25:31.704
because I wanted you to keep
your blood pressures down.

25:31.878 --> 25:33.836
Why?

25:34.010 --> 25:35.708
Keep our pressures
down for what?

25:35.838 --> 25:37.361
To buy more time?

25:37.536 --> 25:40.713
What? 15 minutes?

25:40.887 --> 25:43.672
I'm not trying to buy more time
for the two of you.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.719
I'm trying to buy more time
for your team,

25:46.893 --> 25:49.025
because our only hope is
if they find the antidote.

25:49.199 --> 25:52.551
So please, sit down

25:52.725 --> 25:55.292
and don't move.

25:59.166 --> 25:59.906
NCIS!

26:03.605 --> 26:05.172
Hazmat suits.

26:05.302 --> 26:06.739
I'd say
we're in the right place.

26:14.616 --> 26:17.750
NCIS!
Come out of there!

26:17.880 --> 26:19.665
We hear you in the bathroom!
Come out!

26:24.191 --> 26:25.801
You didn't wash
your hands.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.282
Mc
Come on, Dennis.

26:28.456 --> 26:29.370
You got nowhere to run.

26:29.544 --> 26:30.371
Open the door.

26:33.417 --> 26:34.723
Knight, we got a runner!

26:36.638 --> 26:38.335
NCIS! Stop!

26:45.125 --> 26:46.430
Lost your gun, huh?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.041
Still no way out.

26:49.999 --> 26:51.131
That hardly seems fair.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.102
You sure?

27:10.890 --> 27:11.717
Hey!

27:19.463 --> 27:21.596
Yo.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.642
Cuff me, bro. I'm done.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.861
Go ahead, bro.

27:36.524 --> 27:37.743
My kid's whole future.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.660
What's it gonna be like?

27:44.271 --> 27:46.665
She said her last words
to her mom on a video call.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.710
That can't happen again.

27:48.884 --> 27:50.712
Jimmy...

27:50.886 --> 27:52.975
Kasie.

27:53.106 --> 27:55.586
My heart.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.632
Heart feels like it's beating
- out of my chest.
- Hey, hey.

27:57.763 --> 28:00.635
Buddy, please listen, okay?

28:00.766 --> 28:02.724
Victoria is gonna be fine.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.859
And you are gonna be with her.

28:06.989 --> 28:09.862
- Am I, though?
- Oh, yeah.

28:10.036 --> 28:12.038
Oh, you're-you're gonna
watch her graduate.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.216
You're gonna walk
her down the aisle.

28:16.390 --> 28:20.394
And one day, you're gonna hold
her kids on your lap, okay?

28:20.568 --> 28:22.004
Now, those are the only thoughts

28:22.178 --> 28:23.353
you need
to focus your energy on.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.750
Breena and I...

28:30.839 --> 28:35.365
Breena and I just wanted her
to be... happy.

28:35.539 --> 28:38.107
You know, optimistic,

28:38.281 --> 28:40.022
confident.

28:44.244 --> 28:45.941
She already is.

28:47.987 --> 28:50.119
It's okay.

28:50.250 --> 28:53.470
It just happens way too much.

28:55.255 --> 28:58.606
Grown-ups don't need to hide
everything from their kids.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.564
Well, some things are just
for grownups,

29:00.739 --> 29:04.917
and not meant for kids to know.

29:05.091 --> 29:09.312
But today, everyone is trying
to hide everything from me.

29:11.401 --> 29:13.926
You think so?

29:14.100 --> 29:17.059
Uncle Tim wouldn't say
"dead body" in front of me.

29:17.233 --> 29:19.148
And I know you guys aren't
telling me everything

29:19.279 --> 29:20.759
about Dad and Kasie.

29:20.933 --> 29:23.065
Look, they're gonna be fine.

29:23.239 --> 29:25.633
You have to trust me,
and you have to believe it.

29:35.861 --> 29:38.298
That's what I miss about Mom.

29:38.472 --> 29:41.170
She didn't try to make things
seem okay if they weren't.

29:41.301 --> 29:43.172
She always told the truth,

29:43.303 --> 29:45.305
even if it was hard.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.482
I know you miss her.

29:48.656 --> 29:50.397
I miss my dad even more.

29:50.527 --> 29:52.747
Or, you know,
how Dad used to be.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.967
He's with me all the time, but

29:55.097 --> 29:56.664
he's different.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.666
A lot quieter.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.930
He asks me
about my feelings, but

30:02.104 --> 30:03.889
definitely doesn't talk
to me about his.

30:04.890 --> 30:07.414
Vic, he's doing his best.

30:07.544 --> 30:10.417
And trust me, not everyone gets
a dad like yours.

30:10.591 --> 30:12.288
I mean, he's...

30:12.462 --> 30:14.813
he's the best
I've ever been around.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.860
I just wish Mom was here
to talk to him.

30:19.034 --> 30:22.255
When my angel fish
died, she told me

30:22.429 --> 30:25.258
it was okay to let go,
and still hold on.

30:25.432 --> 30:28.304
My dad is really good
at the holding-on part,

30:28.478 --> 30:31.220
but not so good at letting go.

30:31.394 --> 30:33.527
I'm so sorry

30:33.701 --> 30:35.921
that the two of you have had...

30:36.095 --> 30:38.575
the year you've had.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.577
It's okay, Uncle Nick.

30:40.751 --> 30:42.928
My dad's just stuck.

30:43.102 --> 30:45.626
He'll get himself unstuck,
because he loves me.

30:45.800 --> 30:48.934
My dad will always keep going.

30:50.718 --> 30:52.285
She sounds like someone I know.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.821
Can you say that again, Dennis?

31:06.995 --> 31:08.954
For the third time,
my name is Buggy.

31:09.128 --> 31:10.956
Buggy Stacks, bro.

31:11.130 --> 31:13.567
Your driver's license says
"Dennis Newton."

31:13.741 --> 31:15.308
That is you, right?

31:15.482 --> 31:17.136
They started calling me
"Buggy Stacks"

31:17.310 --> 31:19.268
after I came into some
serious cash, you know?

31:19.399 --> 31:21.357
Let's start there.
You were paid by a terrorist...

31:21.531 --> 31:22.968
Whoa, whoa, whoa....to spread a lethal

31:23.142 --> 31:24.534
toxin that could kill hundreds
of people.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.536
You guys got me all wrong.

31:26.710 --> 31:29.148
This Raven paid me in crypto

31:29.322 --> 31:31.846
to store a bunch
of super Laxative-X at my place.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.543
Plan was to put it
in the water

31:33.717 --> 31:36.372
at a Marine base, and have them
all exploding in their pants.

31:36.546 --> 31:39.158
After that, he gets paid
in cash from Uncle Sam.

31:39.332 --> 31:41.856
And boom-- more stacks.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.424
- My God, are you dumb.
- You don't believe me?

31:44.598 --> 31:46.905
That Raven dude put the
whole plan behind that picture

31:47.079 --> 31:48.254
on the wall over there.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.690
Check it.

31:57.785 --> 31:59.613
Same kind of flask.

31:59.787 --> 32:02.877
Hmm? I'm telling you,
it was all a prank.

32:03.008 --> 32:05.575
It's not, like,
anything bad.

32:05.749 --> 32:07.534
Just a middle finger
to the government.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.231
- Shut up, Dennis.
- Yo.

32:10.841 --> 32:12.843
This looks like their plan B.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.107
Map shows three
public places where

32:15.237 --> 32:16.891
the toxin will be
dispersed simultaneously.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.980
Mc
Says here the Raven and two

32:19.111 --> 32:20.982
of his Unkindness are gonna
release the toxin themselves.

32:21.156 --> 32:22.766
And he won't be alone.

32:22.897 --> 32:26.683
"The cure shall be
under my wing at all times."

32:26.857 --> 32:28.337
He's got Pastov with him.

32:28.468 --> 32:29.556
And the antidote.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.827
So open your eyes.

32:40.001 --> 32:42.177
I don't... I don't understand.

32:42.351 --> 32:43.396
Open them, Jimmy.

32:43.570 --> 32:46.181
You need to move.

32:46.355 --> 32:48.488
I mean, I want to.

32:48.662 --> 32:51.230
This year's just been so hard.
I miss you so much.

32:51.404 --> 32:53.145
BREENA and
You need to move right now

32:53.275 --> 32:54.929
so I know you're alive.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.931
Open your eyes.

32:59.281 --> 33:01.457
Jimmy, you passed out.
You both did.

33:01.631 --> 33:03.198
You need to keep breathing.

33:05.505 --> 33:07.420
Jimmy! Kasie!

33:07.594 --> 33:09.465
- Kase.
- Come on, Kasie!

33:09.639 --> 33:10.553
Oh, Jim
Kasie!

33:10.727 --> 33:12.729
Jimmy. Jim...

33:12.903 --> 33:15.254
Hey.

33:15.384 --> 33:16.820
Don't scare me like that again.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.822
Stay awake, Dad!

33:18.997 --> 33:21.434
You guys okay?

33:21.608 --> 33:24.959
Torres, don't open that door.

33:25.133 --> 33:27.092
You two need
to keep your eyes open.

33:29.181 --> 33:31.009
Kasie, you okay?

33:31.183 --> 33:34.403
Had a dream.
Yeah, I saw my dad.

33:34.577 --> 33:36.405
That's great.

33:36.579 --> 33:39.060
Is it?

33:39.191 --> 33:43.760
Isn't it bad when I see dead
people when I close my eyes?

33:43.891 --> 33:46.720
No, it can't...

33:46.894 --> 33:48.417
it can't be okay.

33:48.591 --> 33:51.725
What about you?

33:51.899 --> 33:53.466
You see any dead people?

33:58.123 --> 33:59.994
No.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.214
No, I didn't see
any dead people, and...

34:02.344 --> 34:04.259
We're... we're gonna be fine.

34:04.433 --> 34:05.652
You guys?

34:05.826 --> 34:07.045
Look at me.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.875
You two should call
your loved ones.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.703
Now.

34:23.365 --> 34:24.888
We will be working
with MPD on this.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.977
Time is of the essence.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.154
There is no acceptable
level of failure.

34:29.328 --> 34:31.156
- Agent Parker?
- We'll split into three teams,

34:31.330 --> 34:33.462
each covering
one defined target.

34:33.636 --> 34:36.161
Team One and I will cover
the coffee shop on 30th.

34:36.335 --> 34:39.120
Team Two will canvas the bar
here, led by Agent Knight.

34:39.294 --> 34:41.122
And Agent McGee will lead
Team Three

34:41.253 --> 34:43.124
to the movie theater
on L Street.

34:43.255 --> 34:45.257
Now, their plan is
to simultaneously release

34:45.387 --> 34:46.954
the toxin at all three locations

34:47.128 --> 34:49.043
at some point
in the next 35 minutes.

34:49.217 --> 34:51.741
We're looking for anyone in
a gas mask, hazmat suit,

34:51.915 --> 34:53.352
anything that can
shield them from a toxin.

34:53.526 --> 34:55.484
We see that, we take 'em down.

34:55.615 --> 34:59.140
With this exception
of this man-- Dr. Yuri Pastov.

34:59.271 --> 35:01.186
He is our hostage.
He is extremely valuable.

35:01.360 --> 35:02.970
Nobody take any shots
anywhere near him.

35:03.144 --> 35:04.754
If you have Raven
in your sights,

35:04.928 --> 35:06.843
engage, but do not fire.

35:07.017 --> 35:09.150
That doctor is our only
chance to save our people.

35:09.281 --> 35:10.282
Watch each other's
backs out there.

35:10.412 --> 35:11.979
Let's go get that antidote.

35:12.153 --> 35:15.983
Uh, just, uh,
checking in to...

35:16.157 --> 35:19.378
to say how much
you matter to me.

35:20.422 --> 35:24.252
I'm...

35:24.426 --> 35:26.080
just having, uh,
one of those days, I guess.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.431
I do love you.

35:30.737 --> 35:32.695
So much.

35:35.045 --> 35:37.744
Of all of the times
for my mom to not answer.

35:37.874 --> 35:42.096
No, it's, uh... it's okay.

35:44.533 --> 35:47.188
Oh, I... I hate goodbyes anyway.

35:59.766 --> 36:01.463
Hey, sweetheart.

36:01.594 --> 36:03.465
Hi, Daddy.

36:03.639 --> 36:06.468
That must've been pretty scary,

36:06.642 --> 36:08.688
seeing your dad and Kasie
on the floor like that, huh?

36:08.818 --> 36:11.256
Honey,

36:11.430 --> 36:14.389
you can ask me anything,

36:14.563 --> 36:17.131
and I promise...

36:17.262 --> 36:19.002
I'll be honest
with you.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.310
Are you going to die?

36:22.484 --> 36:24.965
Yes.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.708
And so are you.

36:28.882 --> 36:31.841
Everyone dies.

36:32.015 --> 36:34.844
That's right. Everyone dies.

36:35.018 --> 36:37.151
And since everyone dies,

36:37.325 --> 36:39.153
what's important
is not how we die.

36:41.286 --> 36:43.810
It's how we live.

36:43.940 --> 36:46.378
Do you...? You remember...?

36:46.508 --> 36:48.597
Remember Mr. Rogers?

36:48.728 --> 36:50.947
Yeah. I love that movie.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.645
Do you remember how he told us

36:52.819 --> 36:55.648
to look for the helpers?

36:57.476 --> 36:59.739
There are people out there

36:59.913 --> 37:02.045
that live their life like that.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.830
As helpers.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.179
That's right.

37:05.310 --> 37:08.095
Honey, there are helpers
in this world...

37:09.836 --> 37:11.054
...that will look out for you

37:11.229 --> 37:12.969
for the rest of your life.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.458
So open your eyes.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.335
<i>Look for those helpers.</i>

37:32.641 --> 37:34.513
<i>They're out there.</i>

37:36.863 --> 37:38.256
They're doing
what's right.

37:40.867 --> 37:43.435
<i>Some helpers</i> <i>
you've known your whole life,</i>

37:43.565 --> 37:46.133
<i>and some are new to you.</i>

37:46.307 --> 37:49.528
<i>The trait that they share</i>

37:49.658 --> 37:51.660
<i>is that they always</i> <i>
make things better if they can.</i>

37:51.791 --> 37:54.707
<i>Being a helper takes</i> <i>
a lot of work.</i>

37:54.881 --> 37:56.578
<i>But it's worth it.</i>

37:56.709 --> 37:59.494
Raven!

37:59.668 --> 38:04.369
And helping people can be hard.

38:04.543 --> 38:06.545
<i>It's filled</i> <i>
with tough decisions.</i>

38:08.982 --> 38:12.202
But it's those hard times

38:12.377 --> 38:14.379
that make you realize
what's important.

38:21.908 --> 38:23.823
And some day,

38:23.953 --> 38:27.130
you...

38:27.305 --> 38:30.482
are going
to be an amazing helper,

38:30.612 --> 38:34.050
Victoria Elizabeth Palmer.

38:35.922 --> 38:38.403
Honey, that's what's important.

38:38.577 --> 38:39.926
It's not how we die.

38:40.100 --> 38:43.408
It's how we live.

39:08.171 --> 39:10.565
Go and rest now, Daddy.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.741
You, too, Aunt Kasie.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.446
Hey, Kase?

39:23.622 --> 39:25.841
Yeah, buddy?

39:26.015 --> 39:28.191
Really sorry
I yelled at you earlier.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.237
Me, too, buddy.

39:47.994 --> 39:49.343
I told you, Dad!

39:49.474 --> 39:51.258
- I told you.
- Yes, Jimmy! Yes!

39:51.432 --> 39:52.564
Yeah, Jimmy!

39:52.694 --> 39:53.478
I love you, Dad!

40:07.448 --> 40:08.797
Hi.

40:08.928 --> 40:10.451
Oh, I see.

40:10.625 --> 40:12.584
This is where the, uh,
cool kids hang out?

40:12.758 --> 40:14.063
Nick insisted
on bringing me to see

40:14.237 --> 40:15.717
your side of
the neighborhood.

40:15.891 --> 40:17.719
Oh, cute.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.897
Uh, I just wanted
to tell you

40:22.028 --> 40:25.335
that I asked Vance to send over
my contract so I could sign it.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.816
Kase, that's great. I thought
maybe after the last couple days

40:27.947 --> 40:29.818
that you... Ah, you know, I realized

40:29.949 --> 40:32.299
if that was strike three,
I want to be ready

40:32.473 --> 40:34.823
for strikes four, five, six.

40:34.954 --> 40:36.390
Girl, you know we got you.

40:36.521 --> 40:38.697
Yeah, exactly.

40:38.827 --> 40:41.047
Where else am I gonna find
helpers like you guys?

40:41.221 --> 40:42.657
You're stuck with me

40:42.831 --> 40:44.354
for a good, long while.

40:44.529 --> 40:46.052
We are so glad
to be stuck with you.

40:46.226 --> 40:47.096
Damn right.

40:47.270 --> 40:48.924
Oh, my gosh.

40:49.098 --> 40:50.448
Your wedding ring.

40:50.622 --> 40:52.754
I-I've never
seen you take that off,

40:52.928 --> 40:54.452
not even in Autopsy.

40:54.626 --> 40:57.150
Yeah, I decided
to take Breena's advice.

40:57.324 --> 41:00.545
I can, uh... I can hold on
to what's important

41:00.719 --> 41:02.503
while letting go.

41:02.677 --> 41:04.026
It's time.

41:07.377 --> 41:10.337
Oh, look at this. We get
to see you both at once.

41:10.511 --> 41:11.860
You got me a bear.

41:11.991 --> 41:13.383
I guess you're gonna
have to share, Vic.

41:13.558 --> 41:15.777
- There you go.
- Thank you, Agent Knight.

41:15.951 --> 41:17.518
Well, that's very sweet.

41:17.692 --> 41:18.650
There's only one guest

41:18.780 --> 41:19.738
per patient, so, hmm,

41:19.912 --> 41:21.130
that would be Vic and I,

41:21.304 --> 41:22.349
so if you guys...

41:22.523 --> 41:23.742
Okay, this is
getting ridiculous.

41:23.916 --> 41:25.004
Señor Vance, Tim,

41:25.178 --> 41:27.310
only one guest.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.921
What's wrong?

41:29.095 --> 41:31.010
Let's take this
into the hall.

41:36.319 --> 41:39.192
We didn't get the Raven.

41:39.366 --> 41:40.367
Unless he came back
from the dead,

41:40.541 --> 41:42.108
I don't see how that's possible.

41:42.238 --> 41:43.718
He's on Jimmy's
autopsy table now.

41:43.892 --> 41:45.764
We talked to Pastov.

41:45.894 --> 41:47.548
The guy that was with him
was not the Raven.

41:47.722 --> 41:49.681
Are we sure?

41:49.855 --> 41:51.117
'Cause this Raven guy
has been playing games

41:51.247 --> 41:52.597
from the very beginning.

41:52.771 --> 41:54.250
I wouldn't put this past him.

41:54.424 --> 41:56.252
Yeah, that crossed my mind,

41:56.426 --> 41:57.602
but this came in the mail today.

41:57.776 --> 41:59.560
It was addressed to

41:59.691 --> 42:01.736
"Special Agent Alden Parker
And His Team."

42:01.910 --> 42:02.911
What's it say?

42:03.085 --> 42:04.870
One word.
