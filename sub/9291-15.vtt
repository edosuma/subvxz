00:14.840 --> 00:17.080
Jack, look out!

00:17.600 --> 00:19.160
Paul?

00:19.240 --> 00:21.160
Get me a medic.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.040
" He's losing pressure.
I need ten cc's of adrenaline.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.520
He was hit before I could do anything.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.400
How bad is it?

00:27.480 --> 00:29.840
" We don't know. We just don't know.

00:29.920 --> 00:33.040
Please tell me he's not gonna die.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.440
Why should I help you?

00:36.520 --> 00:41.120
I'm offering you freedom. You and Behrooz
will go into a witness protection programme.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.360
You'll be given new names,
identities, everything.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.960
What do you need me to do?

00:45.040 --> 00:48.840
I need you to go to Fayed, and tell him
that you need to speak to Marwan.

00:48.920 --> 00:52.920
He won't let me through his front door,
let alone get near Marwan.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.640
He will when you tell him
that you've got a hostage that can help him.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.280
Who?

00:57.360 --> 00:58.720
Me.

00:59.040 --> 01:02.120
- What if Fayed doesn't believe us?
- Then we're both dead.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.760
Close the door.
Put your gun over there. Do it.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.480
What is it?

01:08.560 --> 01:10.600
A woman named
Dina Araz came to me.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.920
- "What does she want?"
- She has a hostage.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.080
A CTU agent named Jack Bauer.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.040
You've caused me a lot of trouble.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.000
Kill him.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.520
Just what I thought.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.480
" Let's go. Come on, let's go.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.840
Meet them at the hotel.

01:47.920 --> 01:52.040
I'll need his flight package,
including clearance and identification codes.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.520
You'll have whatever you need.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.360
Get your things.
We've got a plane to catch.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.200
Let me talk to my family.

01:59.280 --> 02:03.800
Your family is dead. And so are you.

02:26.720 --> 02:29.320
Edgar, have you found any way
to locate Jack?

02:29.400 --> 02:31.800
We're trying. Marwan covered his tracks.

02:31.880 --> 02:35.240
- " Michelle.
- " What do we have, Chloe?

02:35.320 --> 02:38.040
- The PD found the van Jack and Dina were in.
- Where?

02:42.040 --> 02:44.240
Dina's body was in it.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.960
OK. Tell local police to look for witnesses.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.080
We need a licence plate,
something to follow. Edgar.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.680
- Pull up satellite from 8:45 to 9:00.
- I'm on it.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.800
All right, everyone, listen up.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.880
Jack Bauer is missing.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.680
There's a good chance he's being held
by our primary target, Marwan.

03:00.760 --> 03:04.360
We believe Marwan is preparing
for another domestic attack today.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.080
We need to pool all our resources to find him.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.480
All comm teams, coordinate with Edgar.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.560
Thank you.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.680
- Yes.
- There's a problem.

03:39.760 --> 03:40.560
What?

03:40.640 --> 03:44.000
Got onto the base and through security
using the pilot's ID.

03:44.080 --> 03:47.480
As I was about to do a pre-flight check,
they grounded the plane.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.680
Why?

03:48.760 --> 03:54.440
Checking a trouble sensor.
They might have to swap out a defective part.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.720
- How long will it take?
- I don't know yet.

04:01.800 --> 04:05.840
Resolve this now.
It's time to earn your money, Mr Anderson.

04:05.920 --> 04:09.400
The window of opportunity
on the target closes in an hour.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.480
I understand.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.800
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.840
- You working on the Phoenix?
- Yes, Captain. Sent me down from Hawkins.

04:30.920 --> 04:34.440
- You taking her up?
- What's the ETA on getting me into the air?

04:34.520 --> 04:38.320
The sensor's correct.
There was a hairline fracture on a strut pin.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.360
But, uh, a replacement
won't be until morning.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.440
Is that the only problem? A strut pin?

04:43.520 --> 04:46.880
Yes, but it would be one hell of a problem
when you try to land.

04:46.960 --> 04:52.760
Rear assembly would disintegrate on impact.
Only way out would be to parachute out.

04:52.840 --> 04:57.160
- Did you report to the chief officer?
- I'm about to head over there now, Captain.

04:57.240 --> 05:00.080
Then I'm gonna head up to Ventura
for a little R and R.

05:00.160 --> 05:04.720
- Sounds great. Don't let me hold you up.
- All right, thanks, sir.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.160
Thanks.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.400
ME says Dina's been dead
less than 30 minutes.

05:17.480 --> 05:20.880
We can only assume that
that's when Marwan grabbed Jack.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.840
- What's the search range on Marwan?
- 1500 square miles and increasing.

05:24.920 --> 05:25.920
Chatter?

05:26.000 --> 05:29.800
I filtered through everything
from Langley, NSA and Interpol.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.000
- None of it's correlating.
- Volume?

05:32.080 --> 05:37.400
It's actually slowing down, which may mean
we've incurred all the damage we will today.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.520
- Or it could be the calm before the storm.
- Yeah.

05:40.600 --> 05:44.800
The one thing we know for sure is if Jack's
alive, he'll find a way to contact us.

05:44.880 --> 05:49.920
We just have to wait
until we pick up the thread on Marwan.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.080
- Tony.
- Yep?

05:55.240 --> 05:58.600
So I heard Jack called you earlier today.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.280
Yeah.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.800
And that you saved his life.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.520
Well, we both know I owed him one, right?

06:12.040 --> 06:15.280
Audrey's been waiting
for her husband to get out of surgery.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.200
I think we should tell her about Jack.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.320
Why?

06:20.400 --> 06:23.160
- They're involved.
- She's married.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.920
Separated.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.600
- Then I'd prefer not to tell her anything.
- Why?

06:28.680 --> 06:31.800
We may have to make
a very tough call on Jack's capture.

06:31.880 --> 06:36.400
She's a professional. She knows it's
a possibility. It'd be wrong to keep it from her.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.960
- I don't want her interfering.
- I think she has a right to know.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.960
But, hey, you're the boss. It's your call.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.000
- " Excuse me.
- How's Paul doing?

06:48.080 --> 06:52.240
He's still in surgery.
I won't know until he gets out.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.080
Have you heard anything from Jack?

06:55.880 --> 06:58.160
Jack is missing.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.960
Missing?

07:00.040 --> 07:02.840
We think he was taken by Habib Marwan.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.560
Oh, my God.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.840
- What are we doing to get him back?
- Everything we can.

07:09.920 --> 07:13.760
I thought we were tracking him.
He's supposed to be protected.

07:13.840 --> 07:18.200
- No one is fully protected in the field.
- Who was in charge of this operation?

07:18.280 --> 07:19.880
I was.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.360
Get him back, Michelle.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.160
" I have a few questions.

07:41.240 --> 07:44.520
If you answer them, there's a chance
you might survive today.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.800
Don't waste your time.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.160
You located me through a man named Fayed

07:50.240 --> 07:54.400
who, you might be interested to know,
has since martyred himself.

07:54.480 --> 07:59.560
It would help me if I knew
he was the only link you had to me.

07:59.640 --> 08:04.920
Whatever you've planned next is going to fail,
just like everything else you've tried today.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.800
Fail?

08:06.880 --> 08:12.840
Almost 40 dead in the train crash, many more
near the San Gabriel Island nuclear plant.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.840
That wasn't really your plan.

08:14.920 --> 08:18.320
We managed to stop the other 103
power plants from melting down.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.520
That's what America will remember,
that we stopped you.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.040
No, they'll remember the image
of Secretary of Defense Heller

08:25.120 --> 08:29.920
held hostage on your own soil,
and it will burn in their psyches.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.480
This country will be afraid
to let their leaders appear in public.

08:33.559 --> 08:38.679
For all the hatred that you have for this
country, you don't understand it very well.

08:39.120 --> 08:43.039
Whatever you throw at us, I promise you,

08:43.120 --> 08:45.120
that'll never happen.

08:55.560 --> 08:58.240
- Marwan, we have a problem.
- What is it?

08:58.320 --> 09:02.160
- The family of the pilot that we killed.
- What? We disposed of the bodies.

09:02.240 --> 09:06.560
Yes. A relative showed up at the house and
became suspicious when no one was home.

09:06.640 --> 09:10.240
- He called the police who are looking into it.
- Has it gotten to CTU?

09:10.320 --> 09:14.120
No, but he was a military pilot.
It will be flagged by other agencies

09:14.200 --> 09:17.440
and will get to CTU within the hour.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.600
What do you think we should do?

09:19.680 --> 09:23.480
We have to make sure CTU is too busy
to realise its significance.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.560
- Distract them.
- How?

09:37.120 --> 09:39.200
Tell me about the boy.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.400
- What boy?
- Behrooz Araz.

09:42.960 --> 09:48.240
- What do you care about him for?
- Does CTU have him in custody?

09:48.320 --> 09:50.920
Yes, he's safe.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.480
You answered the question,
but are you telling me the truth?

09:54.560 --> 09:57.320
Call CTU, ask them yourself.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.080
- "Edgar Stiles."
- What's the password for the central server?

10:35.160 --> 10:39.360
- I'll get you on.
- Don't get me on, just give me the password.

10:39.440 --> 10:42.600
- It's not your area any more.
- What? You work for me.

10:42.680 --> 10:46.640
No, I worked for you.
Worked, with an "ed" at the end. Past tense.

10:46.720 --> 10:50.520
I've been reinstated. Quit being
territorial and give me the password.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.920
No.

11:05.600 --> 11:10.160
Curtis, could you please explain to Edgar
that I've been rehired as head of comm?

11:10.240 --> 11:15.480
Things have changed, Chloe. Edgar took over
for you. You'll be working for him now.

11:15.560 --> 11:20.520
You're kidding. Michelle called me in because
things were falling apart here under Edgar.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.920
Now, give me my command or I walk.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.640
You have equal authority.
On paper it has to look like you work for him.

11:26.720 --> 11:31.080
- I won't do it as a matter of principle.
- You'll be bumped up to a term-four analyst.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.960
That's a 35 per cent increase in salary,
plus bonus.

11:34.040 --> 11:37.600
I should get that anyway.
That's not my point. Edgar works for me.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.000
Not today, Chloe.

11:41.360 --> 11:44.520
Fine.
What's the password to the central server?

11:44.600 --> 11:46.880
C-l-S-1-5-A

11:46.960 --> 11:49.280
Thanks.

11:49.360 --> 11:54.160
A man who says he's Habib Marwan is on line
one. He wants to speak to the director of CTU.

11:54.240 --> 11:58.600
Put it through a high-risk filter,
activate all tracers and recorders. Michelle.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.160
Someone claiming
to be Habib Marwan is on line.

12:01.240 --> 12:05.520
- Are you prepped for the call?
- Yeah, take it there.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.000
Put him through.

12:10.080 --> 12:13.400
This is Dessler, Director of CTU.
To whom am I speaking?

12:13.480 --> 12:15.120
This is Habib Marwan.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.800
- Jack Bauer is alive and in my custody.
- I'll need to speak to him.

12:18.880 --> 12:22.680
I will return him to you unharmed
in exchange for Behrooz Araz.

12:22.760 --> 12:26.120
You have ten minutes
to secure clearances with your people.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.040
- I'd need more time to agree to that.
- Ten minutes.

12:29.120 --> 12:34.240
I will call you then with exact details
on how the exchange is to proceed.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.800
Did you get a trace?
OK, confirm Marwan's identity off voice.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.240
And we may need to move Behrooz Araz.

12:41.320 --> 12:44.600
Why is Behrooz Araz
worth trading for Jack?

12:44.680 --> 12:50.240
I don't know. Have all tactical teams
meet me in the situation room.

13:22.200 --> 13:26.240
Have the police sent the report
about the pilot's missing family to CTU yet?

13:26.320 --> 13:30.360
I don't think so, but our contact at LAPD
says the report has been flagged.

13:30.440 --> 13:33.440
It will go out to all the agencies
within 15 minutes.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.560
If CTU gets a hold of it a minute too soon,
they can stop us.

13:36.640 --> 13:40.800
- Tell me the second that report gets released.
- Yes, Marwan.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.880
Marwan wants to exchange Jack Bauer
for Behrooz Araz.

13:44.960 --> 13:49.560
- The obvious question is why?
- The way I see it, there are two possibilities.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.640
One, there's a personal connection.

13:51.720 --> 13:55.040
Two, Behrooz has information
that can damage Marwan.

13:55.120 --> 13:59.280
I agree. Edgar, have your team sift through
everything we have on Behrooz Araz.

13:59.360 --> 14:03.160
Go back as far as you can.
See if there's a family link between them.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.960
Did the interrogation reveal
that he knew anything

14:06.040 --> 14:08.120
that might make him valuable to Marwan?

14:08.200 --> 14:12.000
No, but the focus was on the mother.
We really didn't push him very hard.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.480
Curtis, push harder.
See what you can find, but do it now.

14:15.560 --> 14:19.160
My guess is Marwan will want
to make this exchange within the hour.

14:19.240 --> 14:23.280
Tony, monitor him from the observation
room. Chloe, what do we have on audio?

14:23.360 --> 14:28.760
- The voice print matched. It was Marwan.
- So, how are you gonna handle this?

14:28.840 --> 14:33.040
He thinks his mother made a deal
to protect him. I'll tell him that deal's off.

14:33.120 --> 14:36.560
- The psychological approach is too slow.
- What do you suggest?

14:36.640 --> 14:39.960
He'll drag his feet unless we put
some physical pressure on him.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.280
He's a kid. I'm pretty sure
he's given us everything he knows.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.960
You're pretty sure?

14:46.040 --> 14:48.880
- I'll call Richards.
- Tony.

14:48.960 --> 14:53.200
- Go ahead, I'll catch up.
- Have you heard anything on Jack?

14:53.280 --> 14:55.680
We got some information
a couple minutes ago.

14:55.760 --> 14:59.120
- Why didn't you let me know?
- Things are going pretty fast here.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.360
Look, Jack's alive.
He is being held by Marwan.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.400
- How did you confirm that?
- Marwan contacted us.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.960
He contacted you? Why would he do that?

15:08.040 --> 15:13.440
- He wants to make a trade. Jack for Behrooz.
- When is that gonna happen?

15:13.520 --> 15:16.360
- We don't know if it is gonna happen.
- What do you mean?

15:16.440 --> 15:19.600
If he wants to trade,
it means Behrooz has tactical value.

15:19.680 --> 15:23.080
If that's the case,
then we may have to hold on to him.

15:23.160 --> 15:26.480
There's a lot we have to go over
before anything happens.

15:26.560 --> 15:31.920
I'll keep you posted, but right now I have
to get in that room with Behrooz, all right?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.240
Thank you.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.800
All right, keep it at that level.

15:39.880 --> 15:43.080
Let me know if the readings fluctuate.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.960
- He doesn't know his mother's dead.
- I know.

16:00.080 --> 16:04.200
- Hello, Behrooz.
- How much longer do I have to stay here?

16:04.280 --> 16:07.400
- These things take time.
- Where is my mother?

16:07.480 --> 16:11.280
- She's still in the field.
- With Jack Bauer? Is she OK?

16:11.360 --> 16:14.000
Yeah, she's fine.

16:20.200 --> 16:24.600
- Tell me about Habib Marwan.
- Why are you doing this?

16:25.640 --> 16:30.000
Your mother gave us a little information.
She said you could give us some more.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.080
You promised not to hurt me!
Get this guy away from me!

16:33.160 --> 16:37.840
Back over here.
We're just gonna have a little talk.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.480
Marwan's the leader.
That's all I know.

16:40.560 --> 16:44.240
I heard my parents talk about him, that's it.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.120
Go ahead.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.400
What are you gonna do?

16:56.640 --> 16:59.640
- What is he gonna do to me?
- We don't have a lot of time.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.680
No! No!

17:01.760 --> 17:04.520
No! Please don't do this! Please, no!

17:05.160 --> 17:07.880
This is Marwan.
Get me Michelle Dessler.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.160
Ms Dessler, it's Marwan.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.800
Everyone on this!

17:19.000 --> 17:23.160
- This is Dessler.
- Union Conduit Dam, 30 minutes.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.599
I need to know Jack Bauer is still alive.

17:25.680 --> 17:30.760
Very well. Michelle Dessler
wants to make sure you're alive.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.080
I'm being held in a warehouse
somewhere downtown.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.120
Satisfied?

17:37.200 --> 17:40.840
- I can't make this happen in 30 minutes.
- You'll find a way.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.000
Wait, I...

17:43.680 --> 17:44.680
Dammit.

17:45.360 --> 17:49.280
CTU will never go through with the exchange.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.360
I'm expendable.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.480
Yes, you are.

17:53.560 --> 17:57.320
If Behrooz is of value to you,
he's of value to them.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.400
They'll never let you have him back.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.760
Marwan.

18:16.960 --> 18:23.040
In the next few minutes CTU will be alerted
that the pilot and his family are missing.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.120
All right.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.680
The LAPD hourlies are here.
What do you do with them?

18:36.760 --> 18:39.440
I promote any flagged items to the analysts.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.640
I can't do that now. I have to get ready.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.480
I can't. I'm tracking Behrooz.
I'd get on those hourlies if I were you.

18:45.560 --> 18:50.480
I'll tell Meg to sift through it and deal
with any flagged items after the exchange.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.560
OK, boss.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.280
This is Meg.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.680
Hourlies just came in.
Chloe and I need you to sift through them.

19:00.760 --> 19:04.560
- Do you know how backed up we are here?
- It's worse up here. Just do it, OK?

19:04.640 --> 19:06.920
Fine. Send it to four.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.720
- Phoenix is ready to go.
- I thought we were waiting on a part.

19:26.800 --> 19:31.640
It's a good thing they called me in. That
strut's fine. It was just a faulty trouble sensor.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.800
- You're sure?
- I triple-checked it.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.960
It's just a false alarm. Here's my report.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.640
All right. I'll clear it for takeoff.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.920
- " Flight Ops."
- This is Hoader.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.520
Yeah, Phoenix is clear for takeoff.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.600
All right.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.800
- Were you able to narrow it down?
- So far, nothing.

20:10.880 --> 20:14.360
" We need to get this out
to all departments.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.760
Chloe, what's wrong?

20:21.400 --> 20:25.200
Nothing. There's no bad news about Jack,
if that's what you're asking.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.400
Since Jack isn't here,
you're the DOD representative.

20:28.480 --> 20:32.680
These are some standard nondisclosures.
Read them whenever you get a chance.

20:32.760 --> 20:37.360
- I've flagged where you need to sign.
- I'll do that now.

20:43.480 --> 20:47.680
- I'm really sorry about your husband.
- Thank you.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.960
I can't imagine how I'd feel
right now if I were you.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.680
I feel like someone
afraid of losing her husband.

20:54.760 --> 20:59.840
No, I meant, you know, you and your husband
are separated, and you fall in love with Jack,

20:59.920 --> 21:04.600
then your husband takes a bullet that saves
Jack's life. What do you do with that?

21:04.680 --> 21:08.200
I can't think about that now.
I just need Paul to pull through this.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.200
You just assume
that the terrorists won't kill Jack?

21:11.280 --> 21:12.960
Chloe.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.760
I don't wanna talk about it. Here.

21:15.840 --> 21:20.320
I was inappropriately blunt, wasn't I?
I do that a lot.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.040
Sorry.

21:25.120 --> 21:29.800
Sorry, I'm gonna go.
I have a... field meeting anyway.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.960
" When your father spoke to Marwan,

21:40.040 --> 21:43.440
was that on the phone
or did he come to your house?

21:43.520 --> 21:45.920
Both.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.320
Did you ever speak to Marwan alone,
away from your parents?

21:50.400 --> 21:52.080
No.

21:52.160 --> 21:57.080
When they made the preparations
for today's attacks, were you in the room?

21:57.160 --> 22:00.040
I told you, they didn't want me in there.

22:00.120 --> 22:03.080
Almeida.

22:03.160 --> 22:07.760
- " Tony, the briefing's about to start."
- All right, I'll be right there.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.640
If he produces something relevant,
let me know.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.720
" Yes, sir.

22:14.280 --> 22:17.800
O'Brien.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.960
Is anything you're doing
yielding a military connection?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.840
- No, why?
- It may be nothing,

22:22.920 --> 22:26.200
but there's an incident report
that might be worth looking at.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.280
What is it?

22:27.360 --> 22:32.120
An Air Force pilot's wife and kids were
reported missing as of two hours ago.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.800
How can someone be missing in two hours?

22:34.880 --> 22:37.560
I'm just telling you what it says.
Should I run it?

22:37.640 --> 22:42.000
- No, we have to do it up here.
- Then why did you send it down here?

22:42.080 --> 22:45.080
- It was Edgar's decision.
- Should I give it to you?

22:45.160 --> 22:48.320
I'm the main tactical in the trade for Jack.
Give it to Edgar.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.680
He said he's too busy.

22:50.760 --> 22:54.840
- Just run it through county and get it to him.
- OK.

23:07.440 --> 23:08.600
- Edgar.
- "What?"

23:08.680 --> 23:11.640
Meg found something in the hourlies
I need you to look at.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.680
- I'm preparing.
- "Can't Meg do it?"

23:13.760 --> 23:17.400
It's the job of the lead tactical.
Isn't that what you think you are?

23:17.480 --> 23:21.560
- "I don't need your sarcasm. I'll take care of it."
- Fantastic.

23:29.520 --> 23:33.520
- Hey. Is this briefing about Jack?
- " Yeah. Marwan called us again.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.600
Has a decision been made?

23:35.680 --> 23:38.080
- It'll be decided in this meeting.
- By whom?

23:38.160 --> 23:41.160
Division. Look,
they sent someone down to run point.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.600
Is Division thinking about not doing it?

23:43.680 --> 23:46.200
Honestly, it could go either way.

23:46.280 --> 23:52.320
But Jack would want us to do what's best
for this country, not what's best for him.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.960
- I know.
- I'll let you know as soon as I can.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.240
All right. Thanks, Tony.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.240
Did you get anything out of Behrooz?

24:02.320 --> 24:06.560
I don't think he knows anything,
but, uh, Curtis is still trying.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.120
OK. Bill.

24:09.680 --> 24:12.240
- Are you up to speed?
- I got briefed on the way.

24:12.320 --> 24:16.680
All right, everyone, listen up.
This is Bill Buchanan from Division.

24:16.760 --> 24:20.960
He'll be overseeing the operation.
Run everything through him. Bill?

24:21.040 --> 24:25.840
Habib Marwan wants to make an exchange
at the Union Conduit Dam,

24:25.920 --> 24:27.760
Behrooz Araz for Jack Bauer.

24:27.840 --> 24:32.040
Now, before we decide whether or not
to go forward, I need to know a few things.

24:32.120 --> 24:35.560
Why does Marwan want the boy?
What's his value?

24:35.640 --> 24:38.880
We could not find evidence
that Behrooz had any information.

24:38.960 --> 24:42.040
- Did you push him?
- Yeah. I don't think he knows anything.

24:42.120 --> 24:47.400
- Who's doing backgrounds?
- Me. Nothing ties these two people together.

24:47.480 --> 24:51.520
Could Behrooz have had something
implanted in his body?

24:51.600 --> 24:53.680
He was scanned when he was brought in.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.440
- Did you do an MRI?
- " Yeah.

24:57.320 --> 25:00.040
I don't like giving him up
unless I know his value.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.680
What happens if we don't
agree to the exchange?

25:02.760 --> 25:06.000
- We don't get Bauer back.
- That can't be the deciding factor.

25:06.080 --> 25:10.400
If we don't go through with this,
we may lose an opportunity to trap Marwan.

25:10.480 --> 25:13.280
Marwan has to know
that's what we're thinking.

25:13.360 --> 25:16.240
The chances of him actually
being present are small.

25:16.320 --> 25:19.840
But we could put a tracer on Behrooz.
He might lead us to Marwan.

25:19.920 --> 25:23.920
" We tried to trace Dina and Jack.
He grabbed Jack and killed Dina.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.040
We'll take a different approach. Two tracers.
One to be found, the other subcutaneous.

25:29.120 --> 25:33.200
- There's no guarantee he won't find that one.
- There are no guarantees.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.200
But the fact is we have
no viable leads on Marwan.

25:36.280 --> 25:39.440
We have to run with every chance we get.

25:41.120 --> 25:46.720
Have tactical finish up the profiles. Let's get
field teams on their way to the dam now.

25:46.800 --> 25:51.440
- How do you wanna approach the site?
- We'll figure that out when Marwan calls.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.320
Go.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.960
Yeah.

26:03.040 --> 26:06.160
- " What's your status?"
- Airborne in 30 minutes.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.240
Very well.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.520
Get Bauer.

26:39.120 --> 26:42.200
We've got him.

27:10.880 --> 27:14.840
We have to have a satellite repositioned
before the exchange takes place.

27:14.920 --> 27:18.720
Edgar, Chloe wants you to take a look at this
when you have the time.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.800
Hang on, let me write that down.

27:20.880 --> 27:24.160
Just put it right there. Thank you.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.440
Yeah, OK. Got it.

27:34.560 --> 27:39.440
Mrs Raines? The doctor says your husband
should be out of surgery in the next hour.

27:39.520 --> 27:42.120
- How is it going?
- That's all he said.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.200
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

27:47.320 --> 27:48.960
Audrey.

27:49.040 --> 27:52.000
- Any word on Paul?
- We still don't know yet.

27:52.080 --> 27:57.400
We've decided to go ahead with the exchange.
We're getting Behrooz ready right now.

27:57.480 --> 28:00.800
- It's not gonna be that simple.
- These things are never simple,

28:00.880 --> 28:05.000
but if Marwan really wants the kid,
he's got no reason to hurt Jack.

28:05.080 --> 28:08.080
- And if he doesn't and it's a trap?
- We'll be prepared.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.600
- Our field agents have the area fully covered.
- Will you be there?

28:11.680 --> 28:17.680
No, I'm gonna be running point from here.
But Curtis will be on the ground.

28:19.520 --> 28:23.000
Is the operational objective to get Jack?

28:24.120 --> 28:26.120
No, it isn't.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.880
Audrey...

28:34.440 --> 28:37.000
We have to consider Jack expendable.

28:37.440 --> 28:40.800
This thing's about creating
an exposure point for Marwan.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.880
I know.

28:47.040 --> 28:50.440
Thank you for being straight with me, Tony.

28:51.240 --> 28:53.240
Look.

28:54.360 --> 28:57.280
Jack's about the only friend I have left,

28:57.360 --> 29:00.280
so I'm gonna do everything I can
to keep him safe.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.520
All right?

29:02.600 --> 29:04.400
OK.

29:20.480 --> 29:23.600
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

29:23.680 --> 29:27.120
Habib Marwan offered to exchange
one of our operatives for you.

29:27.200 --> 29:31.400
- We accepted that offer.
- What? What does he want with me?

29:31.480 --> 29:35.880
We don't know. We'll be behind you every
step, and recover you as soon as possible.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.680
Does my mother know about this?

29:38.760 --> 29:40.640
Yes.

29:41.440 --> 29:45.840
You made a deal with her,
to put us both in witness protection.

29:45.920 --> 29:49.800
- We'll do everything to abide by that deal.
- Then don't do this!

29:49.880 --> 29:51.680
That's not an option.

29:52.640 --> 29:56.280
- Now put this watch on.
- No.

29:58.640 --> 30:02.040
- Get off me!
- These devices will help us track you.

30:02.120 --> 30:07.120
And I give you my word,
I'll do everything in my power for you.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.600
Hang on. This will sting.

30:12.160 --> 30:16.200
It's a microtracker, implanted under your skin.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.280
You don't care about me,

30:18.720 --> 30:20.800
or your word.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.640
You're just using me.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.600
" Let's go.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.640
I need you to sterilise a video feed to the van.

30:35.720 --> 30:38.120
I got teams that need tactical uploads.

30:38.200 --> 30:42.640
These hourlies need are 30 minutes past due.
And now I gotta put video together?

30:42.720 --> 30:46.720
- Video's a priority. I'll see to the uploads.
- What about the hourlies?

30:49.040 --> 30:52.240
Get on it as soon as the link's in place.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.880
- Is it working?
- The red dot is the decoy.

31:01.960 --> 31:05.640
When they remove the watch,
we can still trace the tracker in his neck.

31:05.720 --> 31:09.000
Edgar, make sure all cellular stations
are put on autotrace.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.080
Got it.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.320
When our vehicles are two miles
from the dam, have them hold.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.800
Nobody goes in until we hear from Marwan.

31:15.880 --> 31:19.560
Castle's team will be there as soon
as possible. Behrooz is on his way.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.440
We don't have time
to make sure it's not a trap.

31:22.520 --> 31:25.480
We don't have a choice.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.240
- CTU, Edgar Stiles.
- This is Marwan. Get Dessler.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.520
Ms Dessler, it's Marwan.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.240
- Dessler.
- I'll give you final instructions now.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.440
Make sure you follow them implicitly.
Are you ready?

31:41.520 --> 31:44.520
- Go ahead.
- How are you transporting Behrooz?

31:44.600 --> 31:46.840
- In one of our tactical vehicles.
- Good.

31:46.920 --> 31:51.320
Now, approach via the Frontage Road.
Pull up at the back gate of the dam,

31:51.400 --> 31:54.840
and have Behrooz get out by himself
and walk toward the gate.

31:54.920 --> 31:58.360
- A van will be there to pick him up.
- What about Jack Bauer?

31:58.440 --> 32:00.840
He'll be in the van.

32:01.760 --> 32:06.080
That doesn't work for me.
I wanna see Jack before I give up Behrooz.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.640
- That's acceptable.
- "And I want him unharmed."

32:08.720 --> 32:11.680
- Your boy scout is just fine.
- OK.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.840
Remember, Behrooz gets out by himself.

32:14.920 --> 32:18.480
If any of your agents interfere, Bauer dies.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.480
- Understood.
- Don't be late.

32:21.560 --> 32:27.000
- Our vehicle's five minutes away.
- Then we'll see you in five minutes.

32:27.080 --> 32:31.640
- That should keep them busy.
- What do you want to do about Bauer?

32:31.720 --> 32:35.120
As soon as we have Behrooz, we kill Bauer.

33:18.240 --> 33:23.360
- Who's going to protect me?
- We are. That's why we put trackers on you.

33:23.440 --> 33:26.560
You don't think Marwan will find them?
He will.

33:26.640 --> 33:29.440
" Hopefully it won't
come to that, Behrooz.

33:29.520 --> 33:32.400
What does that mean?

33:32.480 --> 33:35.800
We're gonna have the area surrounded.
We will protect you.

33:35.880 --> 33:39.120
Why would you protect me?
I'm nothing to you people.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.720
You think I'm a terrorist.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.040
I don't believe you are.

33:46.360 --> 33:50.240
If Marwan is going to be there,
why don't you grab him when we get there?

33:50.320 --> 33:52.360
He's probably not gonna be there.

33:52.440 --> 33:56.720
- We need you to lead us to him.
- Oh, God.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.440
- It's gonna be all right.
- It's not.

34:05.080 --> 34:08.440
- I'm in position.
- Does CTU have anyone there yet?

34:08.520 --> 34:13.280
Rasheed has spotted vehicles at the edge of
the access road. We think it might be them.

34:13.360 --> 34:18.159
OK. Wait until the exchange,
then I'll give you the word to take out Bauer.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.560
All right.

34:20.639 --> 34:24.880
Once the trade is made, how much longer
do we need to keep CTU distracted?

34:24.960 --> 34:28.040
Ideally until we hit the target,
but as long as possible.

34:28.120 --> 34:32.719
And what should my men do
with Behrooz once we have him?

34:32.800 --> 34:34.920
I haven't decided yet.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.240
- Yes.
- They are here.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.720
Good. Send in the van.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.120
I don't wanna do this. I'm afraid.

35:11.200 --> 35:15.440
- We'll be behind you every step of the way.
- What good is that if he wants me dead?

35:15.520 --> 35:20.920
He's not going through all this
just so he can kill you. All right?

35:27.440 --> 35:29.680
All right, the van's here.

35:40.360 --> 35:42.560
" Come on, move it.

35:44.560 --> 35:48.440
- I see Jack.
- We could converge on them now.

35:48.520 --> 35:52.360
Is there any indication that Marwan
has other personnel in the area?

35:52.440 --> 35:55.200
No, just the van.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.560
Marwan's not gonna be there.

35:58.640 --> 36:02.400
If we close in now,
they could take the van out themselves.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.800
We proceed.

36:04.880 --> 36:09.440
- Curtis, it's a go.
- All right. I'm sending Behrooz.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.920
Go ahead. It's all right.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.600
Go.

36:38.680 --> 36:42.040
Is my mother in the van?
She was working with you. Where is she?

36:42.120 --> 36:45.000
- I don't know.
- I don't wanna die.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.840
They have Behrooz.
Bauer's in my sights.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.960
Take him out.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.960
No!

37:01.600 --> 37:05.440
- " Sniper's down! Move out!
- " Take cover!

37:06.760 --> 37:09.360
Why'd you give 'em that kid?

37:09.440 --> 37:11.920
He's double-tagged.
We'll be tracking him.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.760
All right, you two, secure the area!

37:14.840 --> 37:16.840
Let's go.

37:25.920 --> 37:27.640
Almeida.

37:27.720 --> 37:31.120
- Tony, it's Jack.
- I've got Buchanan here. You're on speaker.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.640
- OK.
- You OK?

37:32.720 --> 37:36.760
Fine. I need you to pick up a phone matrix
within a 20-mile radius of the dam.

37:36.840 --> 37:41.280
- What are you thinking?
- I managed to short-circuit some phone lines.

37:41.360 --> 37:45.960
If you can find two service obstructions at
the same coordinates, we can get to Marwan.

37:46.040 --> 37:49.480
- I'm opening up an interface now.
- We don't have a lot of time.

37:49.560 --> 37:52.320
Marwan's not gonna stay
at the building for long.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.720
We have tactical teams ready.
I'll reposition for assault.

37:55.800 --> 37:59.160
- OK. I know the layout. I'll run point.
- "Copy that."

37:59.600 --> 38:02.760
The van's heading west.
Both trackers are registering.

38:02.840 --> 38:07.120
- Good. Let me know if anything changes.
- OK, I will.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.000
Marwan, we have the boy.

38:13.080 --> 38:16.560
They will have placed
tracking devices on him. Find them.

38:16.640 --> 38:20.600
- We are looking for them now.
- "When you destroy them, report back to me."

38:20.680 --> 38:22.840
Very well.

38:28.960 --> 38:32.440
- Where is my mother?
- Your mother is dead.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.160
No.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.440
I don't believe you.

38:51.560 --> 38:54.160
What are you gonna do to me? No!

38:56.880 --> 38:59.840
Curtis.

38:59.920 --> 39:03.160
- They found the decoy.
- How's the injected device looking?

39:03.240 --> 39:05.240
Still tracking.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.840
Wait. No, it's not!

39:09.520 --> 39:13.560
- "They must have found it."
- Damn. Can you get me a visual on the van?

39:13.640 --> 39:15.360
Hold on.

39:23.560 --> 39:26.880
- " Yeah.
- "We need a satellite pumped into the servers."

39:26.960 --> 39:29.200
- I got something you should see.
- "Later."

39:29.280 --> 39:32.680
We need that satellite to find
Behrooz Araz before they kill him.

39:32.760 --> 39:34.760
I'm on it.

40:03.360 --> 40:07.560
We have a location from the phone company -
where Marwan was holding Jack.

40:07.640 --> 40:11.840
Edgar, download these coordinates
to tactical right now.

40:13.520 --> 40:16.960
Our window's closing.
We will only have this one opportunity.

40:17.040 --> 40:23.040
- "You've gotta get into the air now."
- No problem. I'm ready and on the move.
