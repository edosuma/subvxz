TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:03.879 --> 00:07.080
-You need to go on stage
as Persephone.

00:07.120 --> 00:10.439
And if you dance it the way I
know you can, your future gets

00:10.480 --> 00:14.160
written in the stars.

00:14.199 --> 00:17.160
-Tara, you OK?

00:17.199 --> 00:18.120
You're going to be fine.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.199
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Tara?

00:20.239 --> 00:22.079
[theme music]

01:14.239 --> 01:16.439
-I've been up all night.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.200
-Unfortunately, the contracts
do need to go today, so this

01:19.239 --> 01:20.439
is the last opportunity.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.400
-I can't hate her.

01:22.439 --> 01:25.519
How am I supposed to compete
with her if I can't even

01:25.560 --> 01:26.640
muster up a shred of--

01:26.680 --> 01:29.159
-Dance for a different reason.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.159
[music playing]

01:39.439 --> 01:43.799
TARA NARRATING: So often, change
is incremental, tiny

01:43.840 --> 01:47.599
turning points you don't
even notice.

01:47.640 --> 01:53.200
Then there are other events,
sudden, monumental, defining,

01:53.239 --> 01:54.519
that change you forever.

01:57.879 --> 02:01.680
And in that split second after
you've thrown the dice, where

02:01.719 --> 02:04.159
it could go one way by you
desperately want it to go

02:04.200 --> 02:11.719
another, where your future
is suspended in

02:11.759 --> 02:20.199
limbo, do you beg?

02:20.240 --> 02:25.479
Do you bargain, wish,
pray, threaten?

02:25.520 --> 02:28.479
Do you fight or let go?

02:28.520 --> 02:32.840
Is it only in limbo that you
finally know yourself and what

02:32.879 --> 02:34.240
you're capable of?

02:42.080 --> 02:46.319
-When Tara fell, the other side
of her defective vertebra

02:46.360 --> 02:47.639
snapped and slipped forward.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.439
-How long will it take,
recovery, because last year,

02:50.479 --> 02:52.120
when I broke it, I was
out for eight weeks.

02:52.159 --> 02:54.240
And if I'm lucky enough to get a
contract, I'll have to start

02:54.280 --> 02:55.400
work fairly soon.

02:55.439 --> 02:56.800
-Sweetheart, let's just
focus on getting you

02:56.840 --> 02:58.400
back on your feet.

02:58.439 --> 03:01.280
-It's an open operation, which
means they'll go through

03:01.319 --> 03:04.319
Tara's abdomen and insert
a wire cage, which

03:04.360 --> 03:05.719
will replace the disc.

03:05.759 --> 03:08.400
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Grace?

03:08.439 --> 03:13.120
-Sorry, um, that all sounds--

03:13.159 --> 03:14.400
is it January I start?

03:14.439 --> 03:19.479
I've got this Christmas in
Vietnam fantasy plan.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.719
-Actually, what I
was leading to--

03:21.759 --> 03:25.599
we've decided not to offer you
a contract at this time.

03:25.639 --> 03:28.639
Obviously, you are a
tremendous talent.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.599
But my philosophy is that a
harmonious environment is more

03:31.639 --> 03:34.159
conducive to creating good work
than the quality of the

03:34.199 --> 03:36.599
individual dancers.

03:36.639 --> 03:40.400
-You're saying I don't play
nicely with others, or that

03:40.439 --> 03:43.759
you don't want to work
with me, or both.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.319
-She's the pre-champion.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.400
Rumors about none of us getting
contracts gaining

03:53.439 --> 03:54.599
credibility.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.800
-Now, you sure you don't
have any questions?

04:04.840 --> 04:06.199
All right, then.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.400
Well, we'll get you
nicely to sleep.

04:07.439 --> 04:08.759
And you'll see us
in a few hours.

04:11.719 --> 04:14.199
Want to count us in from 10?

04:14.240 --> 04:24.240
-10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3--

04:24.279 --> 04:32.519
-10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3--

04:37.480 --> 04:38.720
-Aren't you late for class?

04:38.759 --> 04:40.639
You can't wear that.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.399
-I don't really know
what I'm doing.

04:42.439 --> 04:43.360
-Well, you should.

04:43.399 --> 04:45.319
It's your subconscious.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.519
Come on.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.560
Why did you tell the doctor you
didn't have any questions?

04:51.600 --> 04:55.160
I'd call it a fairly big one.

04:55.199 --> 04:56.480
What if the surgery doesn't
work and you

04:56.519 --> 04:57.480
can never dance again?

04:57.519 --> 04:59.079
-Because it has to work.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.720
I can't have come all this
way for nothing.

05:01.759 --> 05:02.519
-Really?

05:02.560 --> 05:03.720
You sure about that?

05:18.720 --> 05:20.639
-We're all big fans.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.480
You have the technical facility,
as well as the

05:22.519 --> 05:24.279
carriage, of a leading men.

05:24.319 --> 05:26.160
-Leading man?

05:26.199 --> 05:28.439
Wow, if you say so.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.319
-The difficulty is we already
have several dancers of your

05:34.360 --> 05:36.040
type in the company.

05:36.079 --> 05:38.600
And I want to push things to
be more individualistic.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.759
-But my type's totally fluid.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.480
I can be whoever you
want me to be.

05:42.519 --> 05:44.120
-I'm really very sorry, Ben.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.279
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Tara, those arabesques are

06:05.319 --> 06:06.519
still too low.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.360
If your back is straining,
please sit this out.

06:09.399 --> 06:09.879
-I'm fine.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.160
Sorry, Rebecca.

06:11.199 --> 06:13.680
-So I'm in the company?

06:13.720 --> 06:14.399
I--

06:14.439 --> 06:16.639
I get a contract?

06:16.680 --> 06:18.040
-How would I know?

06:18.079 --> 06:19.759
I don't have access
to the future.

06:19.800 --> 06:23.079
But yes, in this version of
reality, you're dancing.

06:25.639 --> 06:30.319
It's not all unicorns
and clovers, is it?

06:30.360 --> 06:33.319
-That looks youchy.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.639
And for what?

06:34.680 --> 06:36.199
You didn't even like
being in the corps.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.639
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Constant criticism.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.439
Never being good enough.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.199
-I bet part of you will
be relieve if

06:42.240 --> 06:44.480
you can't dance again.

06:44.519 --> 06:46.480
-But this is all I've
ever wanted.

06:46.519 --> 06:49.639
You agree the sacrifice
is worth it.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.279
-How's her BP looking?

06:51.319 --> 06:52.480
Is she becoming hypertensive?

06:55.199 --> 06:56.319
-I don't like the swelling.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.600
-Look, you've got to get me
that audition with Marcus.

07:03.639 --> 07:05.040
-Ben, you're scrambling.

07:05.079 --> 07:06.800
Austin didn't even make
your top five.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.399
-And you're right.

07:15.439 --> 07:17.199
It's a bloodbath.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.199
-Four years, all for--

07:19.240 --> 07:20.439
-Absolutely nothing.

07:25.519 --> 07:27.680
Reed, care to share
with the group?

07:46.439 --> 07:47.439
-You're not going to
get the kids you

07:47.480 --> 07:49.519
want with ballet bars.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.360
-So?

07:51.399 --> 07:52.680
Come on.

07:52.720 --> 07:53.680
I wasn't even this worked up
on my own interview day.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.639
-They changed it to
this afternoon.

07:56.680 --> 07:57.800
-Grab the other end.

08:00.759 --> 08:05.279
-Does this make it official,
you running the center?

08:05.319 --> 08:08.079
-I've told my wife
to blame you.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.600
How I'm going to fit it
in with everything

08:09.639 --> 08:10.800
else, I do not know.

08:10.839 --> 08:12.639
-It's worth it.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.639
At least it's going to be if
you-- if you start the kids

08:14.680 --> 08:17.120
off with hip-hop and, you know,
drip-feed them ballet

08:17.160 --> 08:18.560
later.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.160
-Mate, I wouldn't recognize a
pop from a lock, let alone

08:21.199 --> 08:23.160
those armchair things you do.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.480
-That was good!

08:38.519 --> 08:41.200
But keep your feet underneath
the bum at all times.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.399
Ready?

08:49.120 --> 08:50.039
-Yeah, yeah.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.480
Ahem.

08:51.519 --> 08:53.279
-No, I know.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.320
Well, they can't even give us
a prognosis on her walking

08:55.360 --> 08:58.799
till the swelling goes down.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.399
-We've been telling
everyone at home

09:00.440 --> 09:03.399
young Kat's in a movie.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.320
-I got pretty lucky.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.559
Sorry, Neil, excuse
me for a second.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.759
-How is she?

09:12.799 --> 09:14.320
Any news?

09:14.360 --> 09:17.320
-The update is she might
be in a wheelchair.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.639
And you're here to, what, glad
about getting a contract?

09:20.679 --> 09:23.519
-I didn't get a contract.

09:23.559 --> 09:27.559
Last night, Tara said she
missed us being friends.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.639
I thought I wanted something
like this to happen, but I

09:29.679 --> 09:31.399
didn't at all.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.159
-Can I go again?

09:55.840 --> 09:58.799
-It's been a big
day, big year.

10:03.120 --> 10:06.440
-I can do it better.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.639
-Every ballet school puts their
company up on a pedestal

10:08.679 --> 10:13.120
as though they're the only
place worth anything.

10:13.159 --> 10:14.799
But they don't prepare
you for this.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.440
You're allowed to feel
disappointed.

10:35.679 --> 10:37.639
-What sort of complications?

10:37.679 --> 10:40.639
-She's stable, but it's a
very delicate operation.

10:40.679 --> 10:43.320
It's going to take
some more time.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.639
-How much more time?

10:44.679 --> 10:45.320
-I'm sorry.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.120
Um, I've--

10:46.159 --> 10:46.799
I've got go.

10:46.840 --> 10:47.639
I've got a performance.

10:47.679 --> 10:48.440
I'm so sorry.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.679
-OK, OK.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.399
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Will
there be any additional risk?

10:52.440 --> 10:53.440
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
There's no additional risk.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.240
But she does have pressure--

10:59.559 --> 11:05.159
-Hey, Kat, stable means
she's going to be OK.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.799
This isn't a Sammy situation.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.720
OK, come on.

11:10.759 --> 11:12.279
I'll take you over.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.200
-Maybe we're just looking
at this the wrong way.

11:17.240 --> 11:20.679
I mean, the company is an
organization in turmoil,

11:20.720 --> 11:22.519
poised to implode with
an inexperience

11:22.559 --> 11:24.279
director at the helm.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.080
-And besides, corps
de ballet--

11:26.120 --> 11:28.360
is it just me, or are
we solo or standard?

11:28.399 --> 11:29.600
-I'd say principles.

11:35.519 --> 11:38.840
We should make a pact, now.

11:38.879 --> 11:40.679
If either of us gets
in, we still--

11:40.720 --> 11:42.039
-We still stand out, yeah.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.480
-Not to interrupt.

11:47.519 --> 11:48.679
They're ready for you, Oliver.

12:04.639 --> 12:05.559
OLIVER (OFFSCREEN): Yes!

12:05.600 --> 12:07.120
Yes!

12:07.159 --> 12:08.519
Whoo!

12:08.559 --> 12:10.000
Whoo!

12:10.039 --> 12:13.080
-Just back row of the call for
at least two seasons and you

12:13.120 --> 12:14.519
could get one recent
ego out of you.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.399
-Yeah, I know, I promise I will
be a prop with a pulse if

12:16.440 --> 12:17.799
you ask me to.

12:17.840 --> 12:18.759
Thanks.

12:18.799 --> 12:19.320
Yes!

12:19.360 --> 12:20.519
Yes!

12:30.840 --> 12:32.639
-Exhibit B for your
consideration.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.840
You've always pretzeled yourself
over the ballet

12:38.879 --> 12:40.679
versus life equation.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.639
This is what happens if you
remove dancing altogether.

12:43.679 --> 12:47.159
-What, we're all unemployed
and hanging out on a hill?

12:47.200 --> 12:48.720
-No pressure.

12:48.759 --> 12:51.159
No competition.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.200
As many crushes as your
little heart fancies.

12:54.240 --> 12:59.360
Plus, we could stay together
next year.

12:59.399 --> 13:00.799
-I don't know.

13:00.840 --> 13:04.080
I think, even then, I'd still
need a dream to define me.

13:04.120 --> 13:05.720
-Kind of knew you'd say that.

13:14.639 --> 13:16.360
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): The
National Academy's performance

13:16.399 --> 13:19.159
of Coppelia will commence
in 10 minutes.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.799
-You don't normally cope this
well with rejection.

13:20.840 --> 13:24.519
-I think I'm waiting
for it to hit me.

13:24.559 --> 13:27.799
Or maybe it already has
and I just don't care.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.360
-Hm, because you can
go anywhere and

13:30.399 --> 13:31.799
dance at any company?

13:31.840 --> 13:37.320
-Not dance, find something
I actually care about.

13:37.360 --> 13:40.720
-Hey, my best friend's having
spinal surgery.

13:40.759 --> 13:44.320
And I keep hoping someone's
going to say, Kat, you don't

13:44.360 --> 13:46.720
have to dance tonight.

13:46.759 --> 13:51.799
I mean, to date, this is the
high point of my dancing life.

13:51.840 --> 13:56.159
And I'll take any horrific
excuse not to do it.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.360
-You could also be like me.

13:59.399 --> 14:01.639
You didn't ever really want
this in the first place.

14:01.679 --> 14:03.799
You just decided you
should want it.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.320
-Christian, you got to go.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.120
-It's cool.

14:13.159 --> 14:14.399
-Trust me.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.480
This is not an appointment
you can be late for.

14:27.679 --> 14:30.840
You're kidding, right?

14:30.879 --> 14:33.200
You're kidding.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.080
I told you, didn't I?

14:36.120 --> 14:37.159
-I want you keep it.

14:37.200 --> 14:37.679
-Well, I can't.

14:37.720 --> 14:38.399
It's a contract.

14:38.440 --> 14:39.440
You got to sign it.

14:42.759 --> 14:44.279
Oh, no, no, no, no.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.320
You are not walking away, all
right, not this time.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.039
-No, I want to--

14:47.080 --> 14:48.639
I want to work here.

14:48.679 --> 14:49.559
I want to teach.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.039
-So do 10 years in
the company.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.039
Then be a teacher.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.799
-I finally know what
I want to do.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.639
And I want to start doing it.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.679
-So, dance double
to the rescue?

15:13.720 --> 15:16.480
-Something like that.

15:16.519 --> 15:18.399
So come on.

15:18.440 --> 15:19.360
He loved you, right?

15:19.399 --> 15:21.600
-Oh, I--I honestly
couldn't tell.

15:21.639 --> 15:23.200
But I like Marcus.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.480
Austin could be good.

15:24.519 --> 15:27.080
And running over here, I
just kept thinking--

15:34.440 --> 15:37.600
you've been my best friend
this whole year.

15:37.639 --> 15:41.080
I don't want to spend the
next one without you.

15:41.120 --> 15:45.679
-I can't go to Austin.

15:45.720 --> 15:49.600
I've got so much stuff
to work out.

15:49.639 --> 15:50.600
-I could help.

15:50.639 --> 15:51.360
I'm--

15:51.399 --> 15:52.799
I'm good with stuff, so--

15:52.840 --> 15:55.480
-My MO is making someone my
whole world and then hating

15:55.519 --> 15:57.320
them for it.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.679
I don't want to hate you.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.240
-Thank you for doing this.

16:04.279 --> 16:05.639
I understand-- of course
I do, in the

16:05.679 --> 16:07.320
circumstances, but I am--

16:07.360 --> 16:11.240
-Kat did me a massive favor.

16:11.279 --> 16:14.600
I figured if I was saying
goodbye to ballet, I wanted to

16:14.639 --> 16:15.799
make it a good one.

16:18.639 --> 16:19.799
-Grace?

16:35.559 --> 16:40.320
-Abigail, it's OK, really.

16:40.360 --> 16:43.600
I'm sorry, but I do have a
dinner that I have to get to.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.120
-I just want so much.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.480
-Why would you take me here?

17:16.519 --> 17:22.200
-Because trust me, when the bad
stuff happens, you can't

17:22.240 --> 17:25.440
let it drag you down.

17:25.480 --> 17:28.640
You can't let it change you.

17:28.680 --> 17:29.720
-That's no the real reason.

17:29.759 --> 17:30.839
This is a cheap stunt.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.519
I'm not going to let
you manipulate me.

17:32.559 --> 17:34.599
-All right, tell me.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.079
Why do you think we're here?

17:37.119 --> 17:38.319
-Because--

17:40.160 --> 17:44.160
because I can't see
him even now.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.079
And I so want to see him.

17:46.119 --> 17:47.799
I--I--

17:47.839 --> 17:50.799
I know he's gone.

17:50.839 --> 17:52.160
-Sammy died.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.799
-He didn't get his dream.

17:57.839 --> 17:59.359
He didn't even get the
possibility of

17:59.400 --> 18:00.559
finding a new one.

18:02.799 --> 18:04.160
And I'm alive.

18:15.359 --> 18:16.160
-Hi.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.079
-Hm?

18:18.119 --> 18:19.359
Coppelia?

18:19.400 --> 18:21.759
-Oh, Ta, don't worry
about that.

18:21.799 --> 18:23.599
I'm--I'm where I want to be.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.519
-But you'll be late.

18:25.559 --> 18:28.319
-That didn't matter so
much in the end.

18:28.359 --> 18:29.359
I'll explain later.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.680
I--I got to go get
your mom and dad.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.400
-Ah, my toes.

18:34.440 --> 18:35.599
Are they--

18:52.799 --> 18:55.319
TARA NARRATING: So even though
I decided I wouldn't feel

18:55.359 --> 19:00.519
sorry for myself, rehab wasn't
a walk in the park.

19:00.559 --> 19:03.599
In fact, I'd never take walking
in a park for granted

19:03.640 --> 19:08.319
again, much less dancing.

19:08.359 --> 19:10.319
I'm going to fight as
hard as I can to get

19:10.359 --> 19:14.359
back to where I was.

19:14.400 --> 19:18.480
But if that doesn't happen and
I never dance professionally,

19:18.519 --> 19:20.599
I know I'll still be OK.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.480
-Heavy, you call that 100%?

19:23.519 --> 19:25.039
Where's your turnout?

19:40.400 --> 19:44.359
-Kat Karamakov testing for the
role of Waitress Number Two.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.160
[cell phone ringing]

19:47.200 --> 19:47.599
-I'm--

19:47.640 --> 19:48.400
I'm sorry.

19:48.440 --> 19:49.759
Pretend that didn't happen.

19:49.799 --> 19:51.599
TARA NARRATING: I came to the
Academy to be the best

19:51.640 --> 19:53.640
ballerina I could be.

19:53.680 --> 19:57.799
What I took away was courage
to stop and wonder at the

19:57.839 --> 20:05.839
blank page, the open road, to
dream big but also wide,

20:05.880 --> 20:11.400
allowing room for new dreams,
unexpected ones, because the

20:11.440 --> 20:13.200
point never was achieving
the dream.

20:13.240 --> 20:18.079
It was having one and pouring
everything into it.

20:18.119 --> 20:19.119
-Hang on a sec.

20:19.160 --> 20:19.799
I think he's still
teaching a class.

20:23.839 --> 20:26.559
-Jayden, how am I supposed to
correct you if you don't pull

20:26.599 --> 20:28.680
up your tights?

20:28.720 --> 20:30.559
TARA NARRATING: It's funny.

20:30.599 --> 20:32.400
I have no idea what
happens next.

20:32.440 --> 20:40.279
But I'm excited about finding
my own way to make it count

20:40.319 --> 20:43.480
the way Sammy did.

20:43.519 --> 20:46.799
He would have loved this
space where anyone

20:46.839 --> 20:48.599
can dream and dance.

20:52.359 --> 20:54.400
I now declare it officially
open.

21:03.839 --> 21:07.400
-It's not a book yet and I'm
pretty sure it probably won't

21:07.440 --> 21:08.359
get published.

21:08.400 --> 21:12.400
But it's about us
and the Academy.

21:12.440 --> 21:16.200
-OK, guys, this place
is about dancing.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.440
So how about we do some?

21:23.359 --> 21:25.039
[music playing]

22:04.559 --> 22:05.519
-It's been a while.

22:05.559 --> 22:06.480
-Tell me about it.

22:06.519 --> 22:08.480
[music playing]

22:31.880 --> 22:35.319
-I can't believe-- how did
you all organize this?

22:35.359 --> 22:37.839
-This is a thank you dance.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.200
Better late than never.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.519
Come on.

22:46.559 --> 22:47.720
This was your idea.

22:47.759 --> 22:50.720
-I only did my first class
like a month ago.

22:50.759 --> 22:53.200
-We'll take it slow.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.480
We'll figure it out together.

22:54.519 --> 22:56.200
[music playing]

23:21.839 --> 23:24.200
TARA NARRATING: When I was
young, I wasn't so clear on

23:24.240 --> 23:26.839
the whole gravity thing.

23:26.880 --> 23:30.039
And my imagination got me
in a lot of trouble.

23:35.440 --> 23:42.359
[applause]

23:58.680 --> 24:01.839
TARA NARRATING: I remember
there was this one moment

24:01.880 --> 24:05.640
where time stopped and
everything made sense.

24:12.359 --> 24:15.079
From then on, I've always
known that in another

24:15.119 --> 24:18.599
life, I could fly.

24:18.640 --> 24:22.240
And that's why, in this
life, I dance.
