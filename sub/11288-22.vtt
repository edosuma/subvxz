WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.435
Pizza, pizza.

00:02.503 --> 00:04.404
[laughing]

00:08.241 --> 00:11.344
Guess what I got for
Synclaire's bachelorette party.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.850
"'The Men Chippendales
Doesn't Want You To Know About.'

00:16.917 --> 00:18.585
featuring Cappachino‐‐"

00:18.652 --> 00:20.754
‐ And Nature Boy! Yes!"
‐ "And Nature Boy!"

00:20.821 --> 00:22.322
Best thing, it's in 3D.

00:24.224 --> 00:26.727
We can't let Synclaire see this
unless we check it out first.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.461
To make sure
that it's not too nasty.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.163
Yes. Come on, girl.

00:30.230 --> 00:32.533
Hey, Khadijah,
um, you got those linens

00:32.598 --> 00:34.701
that you said I could borrow
for my little brother.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.703
Oh, dear God,
she's nesting on them.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.941
‐ Well, if you'll‐‐
‐ Oh, okay.

00:43.877 --> 00:47.781
If, uh, you'll excuse me, I have
to call the Crestmark Club

00:47.848 --> 00:50.016
to make sure everything is cool
for Overton's bachelor party.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.586
The Crestmark Club? Hold up,
I thought Overton and Synclaire

00:52.653 --> 00:54.454
wanted to keep
their party simple.

00:54.521 --> 00:55.622
Baby, what could be simpler

00:55.689 --> 00:58.291
than 15 people catering
to Overton's every whim?

00:58.358 --> 01:00.534
Sixteen including
the butter carver. Oho!

01:00.601 --> 01:02.302
That is so you.

01:02.368 --> 01:05.271
You're‐you're planning a party
where a guy is carving butter.

01:05.337 --> 01:08.608
Overton wants a party where
women are covered in butter.

01:10.043 --> 01:13.079
Look, this is an important
rite of passage for Overton

01:13.146 --> 01:14.948
and I just want him to know
that he chose

01:15.015 --> 01:17.951
the best man
to be his best man, alright?

01:20.253 --> 01:22.455
Man, look, as the maid of honor

01:22.523 --> 01:24.758
I gotta come up with
something more elaborate.

01:24.825 --> 01:26.593
Something more memorable.

01:26.660 --> 01:29.029
Something more better.

01:29.095 --> 01:31.464
You want more better?

01:31.532 --> 01:34.635
Just wait till Nature Boy jumps
off the screen into your lap.

Oh, hey, Kyle, uh,
that was Crestmark club

02:15.015 --> 02:17.717
calling to see what kind
of hors d'oeuvres we wanted.

02:17.784 --> 02:21.021
When I told them beef jerky,
hell, they hung up on me.

02:21.087 --> 02:22.756
Damn, Overton, man,
the Crestmark club

02:22.823 --> 02:24.424
was supposed to be a surprise.

02:24.490 --> 02:26.259
Oh, don't worry, Shorty,
when I walk through the door

02:26.326 --> 02:28.361
I'll still act surprised.
Check out my surprised face.

02:28.428 --> 02:29.796
[gasps]

02:31.898 --> 02:34.501
Unh‐unh, unh‐unh, unh, no.

02:34.568 --> 02:36.837
When Damon gets here,
I don't want this apartment

02:36.903 --> 02:39.072
to smell like a hamper
at the YMCA, man.

02:39.139 --> 02:40.473
Hey, he's not the Barker

02:40.541 --> 02:43.009
that used to spray Lysol
in his pencil case.

02:43.076 --> 02:45.478
Exactly, he is the lost Barker

02:45.546 --> 02:47.113
and I'm hoping to get
through to him on this trip.

02:47.180 --> 02:50.116
You know, kind of nudge him in
the right direction career‐wise.

02:50.183 --> 02:52.018
I think you're being
a little hard on the brother.

02:52.085 --> 02:54.187
I mean, he already got
a steady job.

02:54.254 --> 02:57.090
Overton, doing books
at a flower shop? Come on.

02:57.157 --> 02:58.692
He graduated summa cum laude.

02:58.759 --> 03:03.136
Clearly, he is capable of doing
more than pricing posies.

03:03.203 --> 03:05.305
My Uncle Tibby always say

03:05.371 --> 03:08.074
"You can show a man
where the bathroom is

03:08.141 --> 03:10.276
but you can't make him tinkle."

03:14.047 --> 03:16.282
O‐Overton,
could you de‐countryfy

03:16.349 --> 03:17.818
that for me, please?

03:17.884 --> 03:21.221
Kyle, look, sometimes
all that pushing

03:21.287 --> 03:23.790
can push your brother away.

03:23.857 --> 03:26.026
Yeah, well, if I can push him
into a better job

03:26.092 --> 03:27.561
it'll be worth it, man.

03:27.628 --> 03:28.695
[knock on door]

03:28.762 --> 03:29.896
‐ There he is.
‐ Okay.

03:31.565 --> 03:32.933
Hey, Kyle. Hi.

03:33.967 --> 03:35.502
Oh, yeah. Hey, Damon.

03:35.569 --> 03:38.404
Uh, it's good to,
good to see you, man.

03:38.471 --> 03:40.440
Thanks, man. Obie!

03:40.507 --> 03:43.409
‐ What's up, man?
‐ What's up, man? Look at you.

03:43.476 --> 03:46.479
Hey, man, that's a big
duffel bag for three days.

03:46.547 --> 03:48.248
Oh, well, actually, you know,
when I leave New York

03:48.314 --> 03:49.650
I'm going to Africa.

03:49.716 --> 03:51.184
‐ Africa?
‐ Yeah.

03:51.251 --> 03:52.919
Oh, man I wish I could go.

03:52.986 --> 03:54.621
So how long you're staying
in the motherland?

03:54.688 --> 03:56.623
I don't know.
A month? A year?

03:56.690 --> 03:58.358
Listen, as long as I got socks
and mosquito repellent

03:58.424 --> 03:59.660
I'm there.

03:59.726 --> 04:01.702
Yeah, but what about your job
at the flower shop?

04:01.768 --> 04:02.836
Oh, I quit.

04:02.903 --> 04:05.205
‐ Oh, here you go.
‐ Thanks, brother.

04:05.271 --> 04:06.272
You quit?

04:06.339 --> 04:07.941
You just quit,
you just up and quit.

04:08.008 --> 04:10.577
Kyle, I'll get a job
when I get back.

04:10.644 --> 04:12.045
Yeah, that's right, Kyle.

04:12.112 --> 04:13.680
He'll get a job
when he get back.

04:13.747 --> 04:14.815
That's right.

04:14.881 --> 04:17.517
Uh, could‐could‐could you like
excuse yourself

04:17.584 --> 04:19.052
out of this conversation,
please?

04:19.119 --> 04:22.055
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess
I was being a little too pushy.

04:23.423 --> 04:25.626
Guess I'll just kind of
push on out.

04:26.627 --> 04:28.128
Keep on pushing.

04:30.096 --> 04:34.267
Max, I don't know if Synclaire's
gonna wanna go to a strip joint.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.671
Beef Cake Billy's
is not a strip joint.

04:39.038 --> 04:41.575
It's an exclusive
entertainment bistro.

04:43.276 --> 04:46.146
And they got a half off coupon.

04:46.212 --> 04:48.949
Might be fun to find out
which half is coming off.

04:49.015 --> 04:50.450
Hubba, hubba.

04:52.485 --> 04:54.688
Hey, what's that?

04:54.755 --> 04:56.422
Planning a bachelorette party?

04:56.489 --> 04:58.324
Yeah, it's a lot of work.
You wanna help?

04:58.391 --> 05:01.502
Oh, no, no, I just thank God
that you guys aren't planning me

05:01.568 --> 05:04.137
some tacky party at one
of those skanky strip clubs.

05:06.406 --> 05:09.209
‐ It's not skanky.
‐ Shh, shut up.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.946
Man, what to do? What to do?

05:14.214 --> 05:17.317
I mean, what is a bachelorette
party anyway?

05:17.383 --> 05:20.053
‐ But a last booty call.
‐ Mm.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.855
I don't know, but we need
to get somebody else

05:21.922 --> 05:23.456
to do this grunt work.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.358
Someone like busy body mongrel.

05:25.425 --> 05:26.960
Hello.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.695
Hey, Regine, hey, girl.

05:30.463 --> 05:34.701
Hey, Regine, come here,
sit down, sit down.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.436
No, no, no, my lap, my lap.
No, okay.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.405
Oh! Stop, stop.
I know what this is about.

05:39.472 --> 05:42.509
You all are having trouble
planning Synclaire's party

05:42.576 --> 05:45.011
and now you're crawling
to fabulous me.

05:48.381 --> 05:50.651
‐ Okay, damn it. Help.
‐ Sorry, I'm booked.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.053
Booked?

05:53.119 --> 05:54.621
I happen to be planning

05:54.688 --> 05:57.490
a little thing called
Obie and Synclaire's wedding.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.560
Smooches.

05:59.626 --> 06:02.135
You know who throws
a hell of a party?

06:02.202 --> 06:04.137
My girl Ava from high school.

06:04.204 --> 06:06.707
Oh, yeah, she threw that great

06:06.773 --> 06:09.175
He‐cheated‐on‐me
so‐I‐told‐him‐to‐beat‐it party

06:09.242 --> 06:11.678
where we threw all of her
ex's stuff into the East River.

06:11.745 --> 06:14.314
‐ That's right.
‐ Yeah.

06:14.380 --> 06:17.350
And see,
Regine is still jealous of her

06:17.417 --> 06:19.352
because she beat her out
for homecoming queen.

06:19.419 --> 06:21.722
Oh, God, why didn't we call
her yesterday? Look.

06:23.489 --> 06:25.559
Tryin' to read while you eat.

06:25.626 --> 06:27.327
Tell you what?

06:27.393 --> 06:30.030
This bad boy hold your corn
right down the cob.

06:30.096 --> 06:33.199
Wow, that's brilliant.

06:33.266 --> 06:35.902
‐ What's that?
‐ The butter gutter.

06:35.969 --> 06:36.937
Wow.

06:37.003 --> 06:38.905
‐ Hey, hey.
‐ 'Kyle.'

06:38.972 --> 06:40.541
Damon, check it out.

06:40.607 --> 06:42.375
I got this for your interview
with my boss.

06:42.442 --> 06:44.778
‐ Ah, thank you, brother.
‐ Yeah.

06:44.845 --> 06:46.813
Wow, $200 tie.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.381
No, no, no, my bad.
That one's mine.

06:48.448 --> 06:50.150
This one's yours.

06:50.216 --> 06:53.587
And, Overton, something for
your wedding to distinguish you

06:53.654 --> 06:55.455
from the brothers
with the clip‐ons.

06:57.023 --> 06:58.925
How the hell
does this become a tie?

06:58.992 --> 07:00.527
(Kyle)
'Leave that to your best man.'

07:00.594 --> 07:03.537
Hey, uh, Kyle, listen, I'm gonna
have to pass on that meeting

07:03.604 --> 07:04.638
with your boss tomorrow.

07:04.705 --> 07:06.072
Come again.

07:06.139 --> 07:07.508
Well, I've thought about it

07:07.574 --> 07:09.843
and I've decided when I get back
from my pilgrimage

07:09.910 --> 07:11.678
Im'ma be a handyman.

07:13.279 --> 07:16.049
Well, alright, now you don't
need a tie for that, do you?

07:17.483 --> 07:19.152
[chuckles]

07:21.021 --> 07:22.488
You're‐you're‐you're
kidding, right?

07:22.556 --> 07:24.858
No, no, no, Kyle.

07:24.925 --> 07:27.594
A handyman helps real people
with real problems.

07:29.329 --> 07:31.197
N‐no brother of mine is going to

07:31.264 --> 07:33.366
swing a hammer
for a living, Damon.

07:34.635 --> 07:37.037
Hold up your horse.

07:37.103 --> 07:39.906
You're saying that a tool belt
is good enough for a Jones

07:39.973 --> 07:42.042
but it's not good enough
for a Barker?

07:42.108 --> 07:43.443
No, Overton, come on,
this is between

07:43.510 --> 07:44.745
me and my brother, alright.

07:44.811 --> 07:45.946
No, no, no look here.

07:46.012 --> 07:48.715
When you insult my hammer,
damn it, you insult me.

07:49.950 --> 07:51.652
Mr. Fancy Pants.

07:52.886 --> 07:54.755
Well, you wouldn't be
in the line of fire

07:54.821 --> 07:58.792
if you would keep your nose
out of my family business.

07:58.859 --> 08:01.234
And looky here,
your family business

08:01.301 --> 08:04.070
wouldn't be so messed up
if you weren't such a snob.

08:05.939 --> 08:08.609
The way I'm looking at it, you
probably think you're too good

08:08.675 --> 08:10.944
to be a handyman's
best man, huh?

08:13.714 --> 08:15.415
So are you withdrawing
the offer?

08:16.717 --> 08:18.251
Yeah, I‐I think I am.

08:19.753 --> 08:22.523
Fine. See if you can figure out
how to tie that on your own.

08:26.026 --> 08:28.862
You know,
he's just your brother.

08:28.929 --> 08:30.697
I have to live with him.

08:35.635 --> 08:36.703
Don't forget these
adult lollipops.

08:38.171 --> 08:41.307
Damn, that's a lot of detail.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.409
[knock on door]

08:45.979 --> 08:47.380
‐ Ah!
‐ Hi.

08:47.447 --> 08:50.551
Rise and shine,
it's party time.

08:51.885 --> 08:53.920
What's up, <i>mamita?</i>

08:53.987 --> 08:55.455
Ooh, you looking good, honey.

08:55.522 --> 08:58.792
Well, you know,
I can't lose what I use.

08:58.859 --> 09:02.536
‐ 36‐24‐36, aww.
‐ 36‐24‐36, aww.

09:04.237 --> 09:05.539
Ooh, Maxine.

09:05.606 --> 09:07.808
I haven't seen you since
you torched my ex's Harley

09:07.874 --> 09:10.210
and rolled it off the pier.

09:10.276 --> 09:12.012
That was so sweet.

09:14.515 --> 09:15.481
Let me tell you.

09:17.250 --> 09:20.153
What I have planned
for Synclaire's party

09:20.220 --> 09:22.823
is gonna make that look like
visitor's day at the rest home.

09:24.024 --> 09:26.760
Ooh, this is nice. IKEA, right?

09:30.230 --> 09:32.365
So are you ready for the magic?

09:32.432 --> 09:34.568
Come on, come on, come on, man.
Come on, come on.

09:34.635 --> 09:38.839
What about Madonna's penthouse
for free?

09:38.905 --> 09:39.973
Madonna who?

09:41.407 --> 09:43.076
Not the Virgin Mary.

09:44.545 --> 09:46.813
Is she cool with having us
party at her house?

09:46.880 --> 09:50.050
Sure, sure, we go way back.

09:50.116 --> 09:52.719
She was gonna call her song
"Cosmo."

09:52.786 --> 09:55.355
I said no, mama,
call it "Vogue."

10:01.401 --> 10:03.036
Ah. Whoo!

10:03.103 --> 10:06.540
Ava, no, you're not
all up in my house.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.377
Hey, chica,
that's a good‐looking wig.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.050
Regine, she's helping us
plan Synclaire's party.

10:21.688 --> 10:24.457
No, you're not letting
this crown‐stealing heifer

10:24.525 --> 10:25.892
plan that girl's party.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.995
Poor Regisita.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.165
Still bitter about me
winning homecoming queen.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.336
This is so high school.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.440
You only won because
you stuffed the ballot box

10:40.507 --> 10:42.543
among other things.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.444
Oh, no, lady.

10:44.511 --> 10:47.914
This is all me just like
those hips are all you.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.716
[indistinct shouting]

10:49.783 --> 10:52.118
Ladies, ladies!

10:52.185 --> 10:53.687
Ladies, ladies!

10:56.823 --> 11:01.267
So, uh, where you're holding
the gala, Ava, huh?

11:01.334 --> 11:03.704
Your boyfriend's cell block
up at Rikers?

11:05.171 --> 11:06.439
Can I tell her?

11:07.641 --> 11:10.410
Oh, no. No, no, no.
This one is mine.

11:11.945 --> 11:13.747
Madonna's penthouse.

11:13.814 --> 11:15.115
Madonna who?

11:16.750 --> 11:18.752
(all)
Not the Virgin Mary, honey.

11:20.754 --> 11:23.690
[jazz music]

11:32.866 --> 11:35.802
[hip hop music]

11:44.410 --> 11:47.347
[jazz music]

12:29.730 --> 12:30.697
[music stops]

12:33.499 --> 12:34.935
Can I sleep with you?

12:36.670 --> 12:38.338
Regine, this is so sudden.

12:39.940 --> 12:42.676
I mean, I can't sleep downstairs

12:42.743 --> 12:44.945
with those
back‐stabbing wenches.

12:45.011 --> 12:47.013
Man, Khadijah asked
my arch enemy

12:47.080 --> 12:49.950
this bargain basement
Rosy Perez.

12:51.552 --> 12:55.155
She asked her
to coordinate Synclaire's party.

12:55.221 --> 12:57.624
Regine, that pales
in comparison to my situation.

12:57.691 --> 12:59.760
Look, I was just trying
to help my brother out, right?

12:59.826 --> 13:01.535
And through some bizarre
chain of events

13:01.602 --> 13:04.270
I am no longer
Overton's best man.

13:04.337 --> 13:07.574
Okay, so if I'm gonna stay here,
I've gotta provide a shoulder.

13:08.809 --> 13:10.210
Cry.

13:12.045 --> 13:15.782
Regine, can I ask you something
and you can be totally..

13:18.819 --> 13:21.221
Be totally honest. Look,
have you ever considered me

13:21.287 --> 13:23.690
in the least bit,
you know, pushy?

13:23.757 --> 13:24.958
Yep.

13:26.593 --> 13:29.162
Kyle, now you know
that you are always trying

13:29.229 --> 13:32.165
to mold everybody
into your image.

13:32.232 --> 13:34.334
When you were in
the Big Brother program, right

13:34.400 --> 13:36.870
you refused to take
the little boy to Chucky Cheese

13:36.937 --> 13:39.540
but you were forever dragging
him down to Wall Street.

13:40.941 --> 13:45.211
Look, what is childhood without
the stock exchange? Come on.

13:45.278 --> 13:47.080
And wait a minute,
my petite princess

13:47.147 --> 13:49.149
you're pretty pushy yourself.

13:49.215 --> 13:52.052
I am proud of being pushy.

13:52.118 --> 13:54.187
But, you know, I don't think
that's the right word

13:54.254 --> 13:56.022
for what we are.

13:57.090 --> 13:58.592
‐ Hmm.
‐ Hmm.

13:58.659 --> 14:01.602
Perhaps we're visionaries.

14:03.604 --> 14:06.573
Yeah, like,
oh, like, like Coco Chanel.

14:06.640 --> 14:09.209
‐ Or, umm, Gianni Versace.
‐ Yeah.

14:09.275 --> 14:11.044
Or Lin Tang Pao.

14:13.514 --> 14:17.250
‐ Who?
‐ The mother of synthetic hair.

14:19.753 --> 14:21.187
Hello, sibling.

14:22.556 --> 14:24.290
Damon, Damon, wait up,
wait a minute, come here.

14:24.357 --> 14:26.292
We‐we need to talk.
Have a seat.

14:29.029 --> 14:32.733
Now, look, while I cannot
fathom what motivates you

14:32.799 --> 14:35.101
to make the choices you make

14:35.168 --> 14:38.138
I've decided to let you
make them without interfering.

14:38.204 --> 14:39.873
Well, thanks, Kyle.

14:39.940 --> 14:41.875
And I'll do my best
to accept you too.

14:43.544 --> 14:46.813
Well, it is not hard
to accept perfection.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.248
‐ Perfection?
‐ Yeah.

14:48.314 --> 14:50.551
You mean working
80 hours a week?

14:50.617 --> 14:52.686
Never stopping to enjoy life?

14:52.753 --> 14:53.854
When are you gonna stop shopping

14:53.920 --> 14:55.889
at the window to Africa
and just go?

14:57.423 --> 15:00.093
Look, I'll get there someday.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.868
Yeah, but, Kyle,
I'm going there now

15:01.935 --> 15:05.205
and I've barely worked
80 hours this year.

15:05.271 --> 15:09.075
And you are just brimming
with pride, aren't you?

15:09.142 --> 15:10.376
Hey, man,
at least I'll be waking up

15:10.443 --> 15:13.079
to the sunrise at the Serengeti.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.616
By the way, uh, who have you
been waking up to lately?

15:15.682 --> 15:18.084
When was the last time
you were in a good relationship?

15:18.151 --> 15:21.121
As a matter of fact,
I am in one right now.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.256
Oh, yeah. With whom?

15:23.323 --> 15:25.892
I can't tell you. It's a secret
affair with somebody I hate.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.764
Listen, Kyle,
all I'm saying is that

15:30.831 --> 15:33.199
different things make us happy.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.569
And I can't believe
you're seeing Max again.

15:35.636 --> 15:37.103
Shh.

15:38.505 --> 15:42.175
Look, now if you don't
sweat me about seeing Max

15:42.242 --> 15:45.812
I won't sweat you about
wanting to be a handyman.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.213
Ah, well, actually, you know

15:47.280 --> 15:49.716
the handyman thing
is not definite.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.785
Thank you, Jesus.

15:51.852 --> 15:53.520
But I've always wondered

15:53.587 --> 15:55.756
what it would be like
to be a game warden in Kenya.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.024
[laughs]

15:58.091 --> 16:00.026
[upbeat music]

16:01.334 --> 16:03.269
[indistinct chatter]

16:16.049 --> 16:17.984
Bro, I think you left
your chest home.

16:19.886 --> 16:21.788
Here, go get something to eat.

16:25.792 --> 16:28.394
Hey, looky, look at me.

16:28.461 --> 16:30.764
I'm a virgin.

16:30.831 --> 16:32.332
I brought freak wears
for everyone.

16:32.398 --> 16:33.567
[doorbell rings]

16:33.634 --> 16:36.837
Hey, this is not
Madonna's bachelorette party.

16:36.903 --> 16:38.672
I thought this was about me.

16:40.073 --> 16:43.309
Oh, my homecoming court
has arrived.

16:43.376 --> 16:45.579
Oh, yes,
just like the old days.

16:45.646 --> 16:47.914
Except you're not under
the bleachers with the judges.

16:50.016 --> 16:52.519
Oh, hey, we're looking
at women's underwear.

16:52.586 --> 16:54.154
Ooh, now that's a party.

16:55.488 --> 16:57.858
Thankfully I brought something
a lot more active

16:57.924 --> 16:59.459
'and a lot less boring.'

16:59.526 --> 17:03.269
How about a game of pin
the tail on the ex‐boyfriend?

17:03.336 --> 17:06.573
Oh, snap, it's Moony!

17:06.640 --> 17:08.308
Who the hell's Moony, man?

17:08.374 --> 17:10.042
My first boyfriend.

17:10.109 --> 17:12.913
He introduced me to French
kissing and curly fries.

17:13.780 --> 17:15.214
At the same time.

17:16.782 --> 17:18.451
Oh, Regine, you must have
gone through so much trouble

17:18.519 --> 17:19.786
to find this, thank you.

17:19.853 --> 17:21.722
Oh, honey, well, when you care

17:21.788 --> 17:23.589
you personalize.

17:23.656 --> 17:26.026
Well, like this
personalized cake.

17:26.092 --> 17:28.862
Mira que nice?
Look at this.

17:28.929 --> 17:30.797
Yes! Mm‐hmm.
That's a nice cake.

17:30.864 --> 17:32.533
Too bad
it ain't the girl's favorite.

17:33.967 --> 17:37.671
Like this
double fudge chocolate cake

17:37.738 --> 17:39.740
with chocolate cream
cheese frosting.

17:39.806 --> 17:42.709
And what's this on top?
I think it's a troll.

17:44.110 --> 17:46.547
Mira que nice,
I cutting this now.

17:48.048 --> 17:51.685
Wait, honey, wait a minute now.
We've got to record this moment.

17:51.752 --> 17:53.186
Ladies, cameras.

17:53.253 --> 17:55.956
After all, our future starlet

17:56.022 --> 17:58.324
should be surrounded
with paparazzi.

17:58.391 --> 18:00.226
Oh!

18:00.293 --> 18:02.435
Love me, you love me.

18:02.503 --> 18:06.372
Regine, you're the most petty
vengeful person I've ever met!

18:07.508 --> 18:09.042
But if it weren't for you

18:09.109 --> 18:11.277
Synclaire would not be having
the time of her life right now.

18:13.279 --> 18:15.716
Yes, well, some call me
a visionary.

18:17.117 --> 18:19.686
Well, now visionary would
have brought me some beer.

18:20.987 --> 18:22.322
Booya.

18:23.724 --> 18:26.192
Oh, but wait, it's Madonna.

18:27.528 --> 18:30.030
And she's got the rug rat
with her.

18:30.096 --> 18:32.432
Oh‐oh, we get to meet Madonna.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.636
Time for a tour
of the service elevator.

18:35.702 --> 18:39.139
Everybody, out! Bafuera, chicas.
Out! Out! Out!

18:39.205 --> 18:41.708
Hold up, I thought you said you
and Madonna were friends though.

18:41.775 --> 18:43.710
Yeah, well, she's a friend
of a soon‐to‐be ex‐friend

18:43.777 --> 18:45.912
who was housesitting.
That's the story, now get.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.517
I could have planned a party
where we get thrown out.

18:51.818 --> 18:53.820
[upbeat music]

18:53.887 --> 18:57.824
Hey, Lumpy, I was expecting
one of your snooty to‐do.

18:57.891 --> 18:59.926
But this party is swinging.

18:59.993 --> 19:03.336
You got the booty butt‐naked
girls showing up later on?

19:03.403 --> 19:05.071
You got the cleavin' crew?

19:05.138 --> 19:07.473
I just hope they don't get
two of them tear up the place.

19:08.374 --> 19:09.475
[knock on door]

19:09.543 --> 19:11.477
That's him, that's him,
that's him.

19:16.950 --> 19:18.885
(all)
Surprise!

19:20.153 --> 19:23.056
‐ Watch out there now!
‐ Oh, Uncle Tibby.

19:23.123 --> 19:25.125
‐ Hey! Hey!
‐ Hey, how you doing?

19:25.191 --> 19:28.629
Ah! Check this out, Lumpy
really went to town, didn't he?

19:28.695 --> 19:30.063
Check out this spread.
Look it here.

19:30.130 --> 19:33.266
We got hot wings, fried cheese

19:33.333 --> 19:35.769
and three varieties of jerky.

19:37.203 --> 19:39.506
Well, shorty, you covered
all the bases, didn't you?

19:39.573 --> 19:41.608
But wait, there's more,
come here, come here.

19:42.876 --> 19:45.579
Do you recognize this voice?

19:45.646 --> 19:49.716
(male #1)
'Lefty losey, righty tighty.'

19:49.783 --> 19:53.654
'Remember this
you'll be alrighty.'

19:53.720 --> 19:57.924
Mr. Nocadochous,
my high school shop teacher.

19:57.991 --> 20:01.702
I couldn't let my star pupil
get hitched without me.

20:01.768 --> 20:05.972
Oh, Mr. Nocadochous,
35 years of shop teaching

20:06.039 --> 20:08.408
and he hasn't lost one finger.

20:08.474 --> 20:12.078
I almost lost baby
to a circular saw

20:12.145 --> 20:14.915
but I sewed her back on myself.

20:19.586 --> 20:22.623
Well, Kyle, it seems to me
anybody that can get

20:22.689 --> 20:25.692
Mr. Nocadochous
out of his tool shed

20:25.759 --> 20:27.661
must be feeling,
uh, pretty sorry

20:27.728 --> 20:29.663
for the stupid things he said.

20:29.730 --> 20:32.766
Yeah, I am and you know,
I didn't mean to, you know

20:32.833 --> 20:34.300
talk about your calling,
man, you know.

20:34.367 --> 20:38.572
Hell, I'd be a handyman myself
if I didn't callous so easily.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.408
Alright, I'm lying.
Come on, man.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.477
Ah, well, I guess
if we were more alike

20:44.545 --> 20:46.880
we probably wouldn't
get along so well, huh?

20:46.947 --> 20:49.750
‐ Watchdog.
‐ Bow‐wow, best man.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.051
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.252
Hey.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.387
Hot damn,
the strippers are here.

20:55.689 --> 20:57.190
We're not strippers.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.401
Wait, wait,
ladies, ladies, ladies.

21:01.467 --> 21:04.404
As lovely as you‐you are

21:04.470 --> 21:06.640
um, this is a bachelor party.

21:06.707 --> 21:08.308
No, no, wait, Kyle,
you cannot turn away

21:08.374 --> 21:09.843
all these beautiful women.

21:09.910 --> 21:11.812
[chuckles]
I know that's right.

21:11.878 --> 21:13.479
Because
when the music starts jammin'

21:13.547 --> 21:15.481
I ain't dancing with Red Rash.

21:17.417 --> 21:20.521
Yo, Overton,
it's your call, man.

21:20.587 --> 21:23.423
Uh, well, alright,
let the party begin.

21:23.489 --> 21:26.426

21:39.305 --> 21:41.875
