00:28.528 --> 00:31.990
<i>Vandar Adg knew
there was work to be done.</i>

00:32.073 --> 00:36.995
<i>He would help
rebuild and repopulate
the village of Atlantis.</i>

00:37.078 --> 00:38.955
<i>All the while contemplating</i>

00:39.038 --> 00:42.125
<i>what use he might make
of the Witch Boy Klarion,</i>

00:42.208 --> 00:44.627
<i>now that Vandar's eyes
had been opened</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:47.589
<i>to the Lords
of Chaos and Order,</i>

00:47.672 --> 00:50.842
<i>elemental forces
of the cosmos.</i>

00:51.926 --> 00:53.553
<i>A century passed.</i>

00:53.636 --> 00:57.849
<i>A century of reconstruction,
fortification and growth.</i>

00:59.434 --> 01:01.186
<i>Thus, after witnessing
the birth</i>

01:01.269 --> 01:03.855
<i>of his latest grandson,</i>

01:03.938 --> 01:07.650
<i>Vandar again began his travels.</i>

01:09.486 --> 01:11.488
<i>Some 200 years later,</i>

01:11.571 --> 01:15.950
<i>Vandar, now going
by the name Varl'jat,</i>

01:16.034 --> 01:17.410
<i>returned to an Atlantis</i>

01:17.494 --> 01:19.662
<i>that had grown
into a prosperous,</i>

01:19.746 --> 01:22.332
<i>if not miraculous, city-state,</i>

01:22.415 --> 01:26.503
<i>one that controlled nearly all
surrounding territories.</i>

01:28.421 --> 01:33.009
<i>Leading that city
was Varl's own grandson,</i>

01:33.092 --> 01:35.887
<i>still alive 200 years later,</i>

01:35.970 --> 01:38.515
<i>an immortal,
like his grandfather.</i>

01:38.598 --> 01:43.561
<i>The first immortal
Varl's line had spawned...</i>

01:43.645 --> 01:47.398
<i>Arion, Lord of Atlantis.</i>

02:28.690 --> 02:29.858
Khalid!

02:29.941 --> 02:32.986
- You got her?
- Yeah.

02:33.069 --> 02:35.029
- Khalid!
- Is he okay?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.532
<i>Hsalps sih ecaf htiw retaw.</i>

02:38.825 --> 02:42.078
Uh, what happened?

02:42.161 --> 02:43.496
Klarion happened.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.708
He had us on the ropes,
then he just took off.

02:46.791 --> 02:49.460
Tried to strangle
us all, didn't he?

02:49.544 --> 02:51.337
I think I can help
with that.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.507
<i>Shee-fah-a!</i>

02:55.174 --> 02:56.342
Better?

02:56.426 --> 02:57.927
- Much.
- Very crash.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.262
Yes, thank you.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.974
So, why didn't Klarion
finish us off?

03:03.057 --> 03:04.058
I'm not sure.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.019
I thought I heard something,

03:06.102 --> 03:08.146
but was too busy
being strangled to focus.

03:08.229 --> 03:11.274
What you heard
was a summons.

03:11.357 --> 03:15.862
A summons of pure chaos.

03:20.867 --> 03:24.454
I know why you're here,
and it's so not necessary.

03:24.537 --> 03:28.791
I'm here because you have made
my presence necessary.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.126
Please.

03:30.209 --> 03:31.711
You think the opposition's
new arrangement's

03:31.794 --> 03:34.047
gonna shift the balance
of power down here.

03:34.130 --> 03:37.675
But we go through these ups
and downs all the time.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.135
I don't need backup.

03:39.218 --> 03:42.805
I don't need you
or Sparkly over there.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.474
You're confused.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.601
I'm not here to help you.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.561
- I'm here to replace you.
- What?

03:48.645 --> 03:51.356
- Right after I
decorporealize you.
- What?

03:51.439 --> 03:54.150
Ending your existence
on the mortal plane forever.

03:54.233 --> 03:55.526
What?

03:55.610 --> 03:57.987
It's not just
this latest thing, of course.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.614
That's simply the last straw.

03:59.697 --> 04:03.076
It's the way you've spent
the past dozen millennia or so,

04:03.159 --> 04:05.036
acting as lapdog to the Savage.

04:05.119 --> 04:07.497
I'm not anyone's lapdog.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.915
We're partners.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.166
Are you though?

04:10.249 --> 04:12.168
Are you really?

04:12.251 --> 04:14.629
It seems to us
you do his bidding,

04:14.712 --> 04:18.675
despite the fact
that his clearly stated
long-term goal

04:18.758 --> 04:21.886
is to bring the entire galaxy
under his sole rule.

04:21.970 --> 04:25.223
He's all but
a Lord of Order himself.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.183
But look at what
we've done together.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.936
I made a whole world
without grown-ups.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.897
I made a Project Rutabaga
flesh monster

04:32.981 --> 04:34.399
that was pretty gross.

04:34.482 --> 04:38.403
Oh! And then there was
that whole Earth-17 fiasco.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.905
- Success, success!

04:40.989 --> 04:42.240
She knew I meant success.

04:42.323 --> 04:46.452
No, I think "fiasco"
is the appropriate term.

04:46.536 --> 04:50.039
In fact, your entire tenure
on Earth

04:50.123 --> 04:52.000
has been quite the fiasco.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.627
That ends now.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.584
<i>Are we there yet?</i>

05:34.667 --> 05:36.002
<i>No, Em'ree.</i>

05:36.085 --> 05:38.504
We have approximately
one more week of travel--

05:38.588 --> 05:40.214
<i>I was kidding.</i>

05:40.298 --> 05:43.301
<i>It's something Earth children
say on long voyages.</i>

05:43.384 --> 05:44.510
<i>Right, M'gann?</i>

05:49.849 --> 05:53.895
<i>Uncle J'onn, would you help me
prepare dinner.</i>

05:54.854 --> 05:58.649
<i>M'gann? M'gann?</i>

05:58.733 --> 06:01.694
<i>You don't mind if we leave you
up here alone for a bit?</i>

06:01.778 --> 06:02.820
<i>Hmm?</i>

06:03.821 --> 06:07.492
<i>No. Uh, I'll be fine.</i>

06:07.575 --> 06:09.410
<i>I need
not be telepathic</i>

06:09.494 --> 06:12.455
<i>to know you wish
to speak to me
without M'gann present.</i>

06:12.538 --> 06:14.123
<i>I'm worried
about her.</i>

06:14.207 --> 06:16.167
<i>It's been three weeks
aboard ship.</i>

06:16.250 --> 06:19.253
<i>Almost two months
since Conner died.</i>

06:19.337 --> 06:22.840
<i>She has completely
closed her mind to us!</i>

06:22.924 --> 06:25.343
<i>It's not natural.
It's not healthy.</i>

06:25.426 --> 06:26.886
<i>She needs
her family.</i>

06:26.969 --> 06:28.971
<i>What are we?</i>

06:29.055 --> 06:31.766
<i>She needs
the family she created
for herself on Earth.</i>

06:31.849 --> 06:37.522
<i>Garfield and Artemis, Richard,
Kaldur'ahm, Zatanna and Raquel.</i>

06:37.605 --> 06:41.692
<i>I honestly
don't think she can wait
until we get to Earth.</i>

06:41.776 --> 06:43.653
<i>What would they say?</i>

06:43.736 --> 06:45.863
<i>How would
they help her?</i>

06:50.409 --> 06:52.161
<i>The crown Arion wore</i>

06:52.245 --> 06:55.665
<i>was a gift from
the Lords of Order themselves,</i>

06:55.748 --> 06:57.333
<i>who'd come to see the potential</i>

06:57.416 --> 07:00.795
<i>for chaos in Earth's
predominant lifeform.</i>

07:00.878 --> 07:02.380
<i>So, as a precaution,</i>

07:02.463 --> 07:05.800
<i>they made Arion their agent
of Order on Earth.</i>

07:05.883 --> 07:12.056
<i>Their Crown's potent magic
soon infused his very being...</i>

07:13.224 --> 07:14.684
<i>...creating a new bloodline</i>

07:14.767 --> 07:17.520
<i>of magical meta-children,
the</i> Homo Magi,

07:17.603 --> 07:19.480
<i>who lived in Atlantis
in harmony</i>

07:19.564 --> 07:23.693
<i>with Varl's</i> Homo Meta
<i>and with common</i> Homo sapiens.

07:23.776 --> 07:28.114
<i>Arion also became
quite proficient with
the Crown's magic,</i>

07:28.197 --> 07:32.326
<i>using it to advance
Atlantis' techno-sorcery.</i>

07:32.410 --> 07:35.538
<i>Soon, Vandar Adg's
simple village</i>

07:35.621 --> 07:38.708
<i>had grown into a gleaming city.</i>

07:38.791 --> 07:41.252
<i>And with Varl'jat's
martial help,</i>

07:41.335 --> 07:44.881
<i>that city expanded to become
capital of a kingdom</i>

07:44.964 --> 07:48.509
<i>spanning the entire
Atlantean Continent.</i>

07:48.593 --> 07:52.763
<i>It was the mightiest
civilization known to mankind,</i>

07:52.847 --> 07:54.849
<i>either before or since.</i>

07:54.932 --> 07:59.103
<i>Arion looked upon it
with satisfaction.</i>

07:59.187 --> 08:00.897
<i>But for Varl'jat,</i>

08:00.980 --> 08:04.942
<i>it only made him hunger
for something more.</i>

08:08.654 --> 08:11.115
Is he for real?
Who is this guy?

08:11.199 --> 08:12.742
No one.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.410
A stranger.

08:14.493 --> 08:16.829
You seriously want us
to save the Witch Boy?

08:16.913 --> 08:19.081
Klarion nearly killed
all four of us.

08:19.165 --> 08:22.168
And, frankly, the idea
of two Chaos Lords
destroying each other

08:22.251 --> 08:23.502
sounds mighty appealing
right now.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.505
Hmm. Your viewpoint
is short-sighted.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.007
You require perspective.

08:28.090 --> 08:33.095
Stranger!
Dammit, where'd you send me?

08:33.179 --> 08:35.598
Die, you pathetic knockoff!

08:38.017 --> 08:40.645
<i>♪ I am rubber and you're glue ♪</i>

08:40.728 --> 08:44.440
Oh, great.
A front row seat.

08:45.274 --> 08:46.609
What did you do to her?

08:46.692 --> 08:49.779
I sent her to where
your teacher might learn.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.864
I assume you might
want to help her?

08:51.948 --> 08:53.824
- Of course we would.
- Hello, Megan!

08:53.908 --> 08:56.702
Then let us find someone
to suit that purpose.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.462
How are you this powerful?

09:06.545 --> 09:09.382
Brother, isn't it obvious?

09:09.465 --> 09:11.175
I'm powerful because

09:11.259 --> 09:14.303
I'm not fighting
with my power alone.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.306
You're not facing
one Chaos Lord,

09:17.390 --> 09:23.229
I have all the Chaos Lords
in my corner.

09:23.312 --> 09:26.023
And together, we'll banish you

09:26.107 --> 09:30.820
to usher in a new age of chaos
in this world!

09:32.405 --> 09:33.656
Holy carp!

09:35.074 --> 09:36.325
<i>Dleihs!</i>

09:43.916 --> 09:45.835
Ha-ha! Gotcha!

09:52.550 --> 09:54.427
Was my scream convincing?

09:54.510 --> 09:55.720
I tried to put a little

09:55.803 --> 09:58.180
of what the humans call
"Oomph" into it.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.684
No,
I wasn't fooled for a second.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.352
- Was I, Teekl?

10:03.436 --> 10:04.520
Who asked you?

10:11.652 --> 10:13.612
Not fair.

10:20.077 --> 10:23.247
<i>Varl'jat's plan
was simple perfection.</i>

10:23.331 --> 10:28.294
<i>Use the power of the Crown
to sink the Atlantean capital.</i>

10:28.377 --> 10:32.048
<i>Unfortunately, Arion
did not agree.</i>

10:32.131 --> 10:35.134
Thousands upon
thousands would die!

10:35.217 --> 10:38.471
<i>That was true,
Varl countered, but...</i>

10:38.554 --> 10:41.724
Hundreds of your
Homo Magi would survive.

10:41.807 --> 10:45.144
The Crisis will activate
their potential!

10:45.227 --> 10:46.687
<i>Varl'jat had traveled</i>

10:46.771 --> 10:48.898
<i>the length and breadth
of his world</i>

10:48.981 --> 10:52.234
<i>and knew he could not claim
supremacy over the Earth,</i>

10:52.318 --> 10:55.738
<i>when three-fourths
of its surface
was covered in ocean,</i>

10:55.821 --> 10:59.658
<i>beyond his reach,
beyond his rule.</i>

10:59.742 --> 11:03.871
<i>But Arion's descendants,
those that survived,</i>

11:03.954 --> 11:07.083
<i>would surely conquer
the vasty deep.</i>

11:07.166 --> 11:10.586
<i>This chaos would bring
order to it all.</i>

11:10.669 --> 11:15.424
<i>The Atlanteans simply required
the proper incentive.</i>

11:15.508 --> 11:19.637
<i>Unfortunately, Arion
categorically refused</i>

11:19.720 --> 11:23.265
<i>to help his grandfather sink
any of Atlantis.</i>

11:23.349 --> 11:28.229
<i>Varl was disappointed
in his grandson's
shortsightedness.</i>

11:28.312 --> 11:29.939
<i>But the immortal didn't require</i>

11:30.022 --> 11:34.151
<i>Arion's permission
or even his help.</i>

11:34.235 --> 11:36.028
<i>Only his bloodline.</i>

11:36.112 --> 11:38.948
<i>And so Varl'jat waited</i>

11:39.031 --> 11:41.117
<i>until on the
thousandth anniversary</i>

11:41.200 --> 11:44.453
<i>of Vandar Adg's pact
with the Witch Boy...</i>

11:44.537 --> 11:49.500
<i>the Chaos Lord,
Klarion, returned.</i>

11:52.169 --> 11:54.797
I thought you were
taking us to Zatanna.

11:54.880 --> 11:55.965
Where are we?

11:56.048 --> 11:57.049
London, England.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.634
More importantly,

11:58.717 --> 12:02.805
we are in the Sanctum Sanctorum
of one Jason Blood.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.807
Indeed, you are, stranger.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.351
Might "one Jason Blood"
ask why,

12:07.435 --> 12:09.937
and hope for a minimally
enigmatic answer?

12:10.020 --> 12:11.522
Yeah, good luck with that.

12:11.605 --> 12:15.025
I hold few answers.
Only questions.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.861
Told ya.

12:16.944 --> 12:20.823
What do you know, Blood?
What have you sensed?

12:20.906 --> 12:24.827
The coming of Chaos.
A stirring of the Demon.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.370
This one isn't much better.

12:26.454 --> 12:29.540
Uh, please do not touch that.
It's very powerful.

12:29.623 --> 12:33.002
Would you not agree that
the balance must be maintained?

12:33.085 --> 12:37.590
Such, to my eternal
displeasure, is my lot...

12:37.673 --> 12:39.216
and my curse.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.801
Don't touch
that either.

12:40.885 --> 12:44.346
It's different,
but also very powerful.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.931
Then can you not see

12:46.015 --> 12:49.810
that the Witch Boy
requires your... friend?

12:49.894 --> 12:54.857
You speak as if my "friend"
is an instrument of precision.

12:54.940 --> 12:59.153
But at best, he is a cannon
I may attempt to aim.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.447
There's a reason I haven't
set him free in years.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.741
Basically,
don't touch anything, girl!

13:03.824 --> 13:04.867
Sorry, sorry.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.494
Look, Zatanna's
still out there.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.704
So if you have a cannon,
aim it already.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.877
If it must be done.

13:14.960 --> 13:19.131
Change, change
O' form of man.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.301
Release the might
from fleshy mire!

13:22.384 --> 13:25.804
Boil the blood
in heart of fire!

13:25.888 --> 13:29.058
- Gone, gone, the form of man!

13:29.141 --> 13:33.562
Rise the Demon, Etrigan!

13:54.500 --> 13:58.087
[Em'ree-Rita sighs
in exasperation] <i>O.M.C.!</i>

13:58.170 --> 14:01.298
<i>This ma'al trip
is ma'al endless!</i>

14:01.382 --> 14:03.676
<i>At the moment, I can't remember
why I ever wanted to go</i>

14:03.759 --> 14:07.513
<i>to that boring, banal
third rock from the sun.</i>

14:07.596 --> 14:09.265
<i>No one forced you
to come.</i>

14:09.348 --> 14:11.058
<i>I came
because you needed me.</i>

14:11.141 --> 14:13.060
<i>I never
asked you for that.</i>

14:13.143 --> 14:14.436
<i>You didn't
have to ask!</i>

14:14.520 --> 14:16.605
<i>I wanted to be here for you!</i>

14:16.689 --> 14:20.192
<i>Of course!
This is all about you--
Only now,</i>

14:20.276 --> 14:22.319
<i>you won't open your mind
to me at all!</i>

14:22.403 --> 14:24.905
<i>And what
in our history makes
you think I would ever--</i>

14:24.989 --> 14:26.448
<i>Because you are</i>

14:26.532 --> 14:28.617
<i>the most unforgiving
excuse for a sister--</i>

14:28.701 --> 14:30.452
<i>Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!</i>

14:30.536 --> 14:32.496
<i>Nothing I do
will ever be enough, will it?</i>

14:32.580 --> 14:34.373
<i>Em'ree,
I'm a professional
guidance counselor!</i>

14:34.456 --> 14:36.625
<i>I know you're trying
to generate a catharsis for me!</i>

14:36.709 --> 14:39.169
<i>Is it working?
A little bit!</i>

14:44.466 --> 14:48.012
<i>Oh, I haven't
seen you laugh since...</i>

14:49.430 --> 14:54.810
<i>Since he was taken from me.</i>

15:00.232 --> 15:01.692
<i>He's gone.</i>

15:01.775 --> 15:05.154
<i>I... I don't know what
I'm gonna do without him.</i>

15:05.237 --> 15:09.950
<i>You don't
have to know. Not yet.</i>

15:10.034 --> 15:11.452
<i>You need time.</i>

15:11.535 --> 15:14.747
<i>Thank you.</i>

15:14.830 --> 15:17.458
<i>You're a terrible counselor,</i>

15:17.541 --> 15:20.502
<i>but you're
kind of a great sister.</i>

15:27.217 --> 15:28.677
<i>What was that?</i>

15:28.761 --> 15:30.971
<i>Uh, a false alarm,
I guess?</i>

15:36.310 --> 15:40.773
Like Jason Blood,

15:40.856 --> 15:45.235
this child doth hide an 'other

15:45.319 --> 15:48.322
of her own inside.

15:48.405 --> 15:51.241
What? I'm nothing
like you and Blood.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.701
Time to go, Etrigan.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.538
Etrigan cares little

15:56.622 --> 16:00.376
for your commands
or Blood's desires.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.544
Had my half-brother, Merlin,

16:02.628 --> 16:07.091
not cursed me into servitude,
I'd let you all burn.

16:08.967 --> 16:14.098
If it were up to this demon,
I'd burn you myself.

16:14.181 --> 16:18.227
Then it is fortunate the choice
is out of your claws.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.654
Flaming serpents? Really?

16:28.737 --> 16:31.824
I stopped doing
that old schtick years ago!

16:35.411 --> 16:37.746
- Etrigan? What are you--

16:53.512 --> 16:55.264
Hello, maggot!

16:55.347 --> 16:56.515
That's the ticket!

16:56.598 --> 16:58.600
Attack the Witch Girl's anchor!

17:22.708 --> 17:24.877
My blasts are supposed
to destroy you,

17:24.960 --> 17:26.628
you stupid zirconia!

17:26.712 --> 17:27.921
- Huh?

17:28.005 --> 17:30.257
"Rock Tsunami?"
That doesn't even make--

17:35.429 --> 17:37.639
- Oh, carp.

17:46.482 --> 17:50.611
<i>Exactly one millennia
after their initial bargain,</i>

17:50.694 --> 17:53.447
<i>Varl'jat and Klarion
made a new accord.</i>

17:54.907 --> 17:59.703
<i>Finding common ground...
in a common cause.</i>

17:59.787 --> 18:03.081
<i>The sinking
of the city of Atlantis.</i>

18:04.917 --> 18:06.752
<i>No matter
the opposition,</i>

18:06.835 --> 18:09.963
<i>no matter the cost.</i>

18:15.511 --> 18:17.221
<i>Nor did it end there.</i>

18:17.304 --> 18:21.099
<i>The Chaos Lords
enjoyed the show...</i>

18:21.183 --> 18:22.726
<i>but called for an encore.</i>

18:24.561 --> 18:28.774
<i>Klarion could not
be sated by one Atlantean city.</i>

18:28.857 --> 18:30.943
<i>His appetite grew and grew,</i>

18:31.026 --> 18:36.740
<i>until the entire continent
and all its treasures</i>

18:36.824 --> 18:39.326
<i>sank beneath the waves.</i>

18:40.327 --> 18:42.538
<i>Varl's heart was heavy.</i>

18:42.621 --> 18:46.041
<i>He regretted the passing
of his grandson.</i>

18:46.125 --> 18:50.295
<i>And he never intended
for all of Atlantis to fall,</i>

18:50.379 --> 18:54.550
<i>nor for so many Atlanteans
to die.</i>

18:54.633 --> 18:57.010
<i>Though nearly all of them did.</i>

18:57.094 --> 18:59.638
<i>Still, as Varl had predicted,</i>

18:59.721 --> 19:04.560
<i>the meta-genes
of a few</i> Homo Magi
<i>were indeed activated.</i>

19:04.643 --> 19:08.730
<i>and the Water-Breathers
of Atlantis were born.</i>

19:08.814 --> 19:13.777
<i>Eventually,</i> Homo Mermanus <i>would
scatter across the seven seas,</i>

19:13.861 --> 19:16.321
<i>until the new
Kingdom of Atlantis</i>

19:16.405 --> 19:18.699
<i>controlled three-fourths
of the globe.</i>

19:20.158 --> 19:24.663
<i>So, ultimately,
Varl'jat was satisfied.</i>

19:24.746 --> 19:26.582
<i>As was Klarion.</i>

19:28.667 --> 19:30.919
<i>-What</i> a grand old time!
<i>"What a grand
old time."</i>

19:31.003 --> 19:33.922
<i>He insisted on continuing
their alliance...</i>

19:34.006 --> 19:36.466
<i>whether Varl liked it or not.</i>

19:38.927 --> 19:39.970
Yikes!

20:09.041 --> 20:16.006
Fire always does the trick,
melts them down to candle wick.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.215
Huh?

20:23.764 --> 20:25.599
Uh, that can't be good.

20:25.682 --> 20:29.394
Carp, carp, carp, carp,
carp, carp, carp!

20:46.662 --> 20:48.413
<i>-Etativel!</i>

20:51.416 --> 20:54.586
- No fair! No fair! No fair!

20:54.670 --> 20:58.256
I could kick your butt, too,
if the Chaos Lords backed me!

20:58.340 --> 20:59.716
Ah, fine.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.345
We shall both limit ourselves
to our own power.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.473
Liar, liar, pants for hire!

21:06.556 --> 21:07.891
No, no, no, no!

21:09.351 --> 21:12.354
Oh, that is very disappointing.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.981
- Come, Flaw.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.325
<i>Shee-fah-a!</i>

21:28.870 --> 21:29.997
How do you feel?

21:30.080 --> 21:32.249
Like Nightwing's
workout bag.

21:32.332 --> 21:35.711
And have you
acquired perspective?

21:35.794 --> 21:38.005
Enough to know
we need more help.

21:39.756 --> 21:43.051
<i>Thus order
can serve chaos...</i>

21:43.135 --> 21:46.013
<i>and chaos can serve order.</i>

21:46.096 --> 21:49.933
As long as the balance
is maintained.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.268
Father.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.770
Why do you tell us
what we already know?

21:53.854 --> 21:58.358
To remind you, my son,
of what you must not forget.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.901
The sinking of Atlantis

21:59.985 --> 22:01.695
demonstrates the need
for chaos.

22:01.778 --> 22:05.407
Without it, the undersea
kingdoms you now help defend

22:05.490 --> 22:07.034
would never have existed.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.995
Nor would they
exist if Arion's bloodline,

22:10.078 --> 22:12.289
the <i>Homo Magi</i> of Atlantis,

22:12.372 --> 22:15.292
had not restored order
below the waves.

22:15.375 --> 22:16.752
Agreed.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.253
But who will restore order

22:18.336 --> 22:20.172
in the wake
of the greater chaos

22:20.255 --> 22:22.132
that the Child brings?

22:22.215 --> 22:25.469
You? With your aging host body?

22:27.763 --> 22:32.768
Nabu, you may not like
Klarion, or me.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.811
but the Witch Boy is a weapon

22:34.895 --> 22:38.523
I have learned to aim,
to control.

22:38.607 --> 22:39.983
And, at the very least,

22:40.067 --> 22:42.861
you know I seek the advancement
of the Earth.

22:42.944 --> 22:46.615
But this new Child
is beyond my control

22:46.698 --> 22:49.242
or your ability to counter.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.662
Think on that.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.602
Commence Project Lifeboat.

23:15.685 --> 23:17.979
Send boom tubes
to every member of the Light

23:18.063 --> 23:19.773
and anyone they designate.

23:19.856 --> 23:22.943
Offer the same courtesy
to Ra's and his family.

23:23.026 --> 23:25.987
I doubt he'll accept,
but make the offer.

23:26.071 --> 23:30.242
Secure our operations in
Markovia and United Rhelasia.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.994
Transport the entire contents
of my History Cave

23:33.078 --> 23:34.913
from beneath Khuiten Peak.

23:34.996 --> 23:37.332
And bring all Psy-Backs aboard.

23:37.415 --> 23:39.668
Anything and everything
of value

23:39.751 --> 23:42.838
must be transferred off Earth
to the Warworld,

23:42.921 --> 23:47.592
until we see how this
chaotic little drama ends.
