WEBVTT

00:49.875 --> 00:52.208
Another?
- No, thank you.

00:55.208 --> 00:56.708
A coffee, please.

01:03.208 --> 01:04.041
I'm married.

01:06.166 --> 01:10.041
I admire your confidence,
but I'm not trying to seduce you.

01:12.791 --> 01:14.416
Word is you found a way out.

01:16.208 --> 01:19.708
Many British were trapped
in France after the retreat at Dunkirk.

01:20.208 --> 01:21.208
Too many.

01:23.291 --> 01:24.291
They need help.

01:25.333 --> 01:28.041
You're asking me to smuggle British POWs
out of France?

01:28.708 --> 01:29.541
I'm American.

01:29.541 --> 01:30.791
Exactly.

01:36.291 --> 01:38.708
Britain is at war and under siege.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.000
We need allies
who can operate freely in France.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.625
- Miss...
- Call me Margaux.

01:44.125 --> 01:48.166
Margaux, my country is
officially neutral in this war.

01:48.166 --> 01:52.250
I read the articles you wrote from Berlin
in <i>The New York Times,</i> Mr. Fry.

01:52.250 --> 01:55.000
I know exactly
how you feel about American neutrality.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.458
What you're suggesting

02:04.458 --> 02:05.291
is treason.

02:07.750 --> 02:08.916
Mr. Benjamin.

02:09.666 --> 02:12.416
Excuse me.
I hope you don't mind. I...

02:12.416 --> 02:14.666
I just have a question about your work.

02:14.666 --> 02:15.916
What brings you here?

02:15.916 --> 02:18.416
Oh, curiosity.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.375
Here. Uh...

02:23.375 --> 02:28.500
If the aura of unique objects disappears
when they are mass-produced,

02:29.375 --> 02:30.375
where does it go?

02:31.875 --> 02:34.083
The more interesting question would be,

02:34.083 --> 02:39.750
what happens to the aura of <i>unique</i> objects

02:39.750 --> 02:42.541
that are scattered by the forces of evil

02:43.541 --> 02:46.125
while the world as we know it
is being destroyed,

02:46.125 --> 02:47.916
broken into pieces?

02:49.791 --> 02:50.791
But one day,

02:51.541 --> 02:55.791
we will put the pieces
back together again, like a puzzle.

02:57.791 --> 03:00.708
And this process is called <i>tikkun olam.</i>

03:00.708 --> 03:07.291
<i>Tikkun olam.</i>

03:07.291 --> 03:08.500
Exactly.

03:08.500 --> 03:12.125
We are looking to fund
resistance cells like yours.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.208
The Emergency Rescue Committee
is a <i>relief</i> organization.

03:15.208 --> 03:18.708
I'm here helping people escape violence,
not contribute to it.

03:18.708 --> 03:21.125
- So help our boys escape.
- I can't help you.

03:21.125 --> 03:24.208
See the man over there?
In the overcoat, just passing by?

03:24.791 --> 03:28.500
Commander of the Marseille police.
He's preparing to raid the Splendide.

03:30.041 --> 03:31.291
- When?
Oh...

03:32.750 --> 03:34.583
- Five, ten minutes.
- What?

03:34.583 --> 03:38.041
The man reading the Italian
newspaper, that's one of his men.

03:38.041 --> 03:41.625
So are those two wearing scarves,
having a conversation by the desk,

03:42.125 --> 03:45.583
and that man
having his shoes shined, smoking a cigar.

03:48.291 --> 03:50.916
All four are
just waiting for the commander's signal.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.500
You can't know that.

03:54.291 --> 03:55.958
Just wait here and find out.

04:06.416 --> 04:09.083
Larbi Benbarek, you saw
his recent triumph?

04:09.083 --> 04:10.916
- Who?
- Larbi Benbarek.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.750
- The Black Pearl of Marseille.
- Paul.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.750
- You are not a football fan?
- No.

04:17.083 --> 04:19.500
I believe this hotel is about be raided.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.583
- What?
- We have to get our people out.

04:21.583 --> 04:25.458
Mr. Benjamin and some of the others
are headed to Banyuls by train today

04:25.458 --> 04:27.333
and over the Pyrenees tonight.

04:27.833 --> 04:29.083
Can you get him to Lisa?

04:29.083 --> 04:32.041
I have an idea of where
I can take the others for one night.

04:32.041 --> 04:34.291
Anyway, is Mary Jayne upstairs?

04:34.291 --> 04:36.291
- Oh!
Aren't they great?

04:37.416 --> 04:41.666
If everyone's dressed as vineyard workers,
Lisa can take people over during the day.

04:41.666 --> 04:43.708
And they're so much more comfortable

04:43.708 --> 04:46.375
than those old boots
everyone keeps showing up in.

04:47.041 --> 04:49.458
- You don't like?
- No, they're not big enough.

04:49.458 --> 04:52.666
Oh. They're so comfortable,
I may never take them off.

04:52.666 --> 04:54.833
As long as you don't run off in them.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.666
No. I'm not going anywhere,

04:57.166 --> 05:00.041
even though my father is furious with me.

05:00.041 --> 05:03.791
He keeps saying, "Marseille is no place
for an American woman like you."

05:04.291 --> 05:06.333
What's an American woman like you?

05:11.125 --> 05:12.625
You know.

05:14.458 --> 05:16.583
Well, you don't see American tourists.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.666
Excuse me, I'm not a tourist.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.166
- No.
Why are you laughing?

05:21.166 --> 05:22.083
It's not funny.

05:22.083 --> 05:26.125
I have real responsibilities here.
There are people who are counting on me.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.125
Yeah. I am counting on you.

05:29.708 --> 05:31.250
Are you making fun of me?

05:33.125 --> 05:34.916
I would never make fun of you.

05:46.125 --> 05:48.208
- The police are raiding the hotel.
- What?

05:54.666 --> 05:56.000
- Police!
- Police!

05:56.625 --> 05:58.625
Police! Come on!

05:58.625 --> 05:59.625
Your papers!

06:03.708 --> 06:05.208
What is going on?

06:06.208 --> 06:08.708
- And you are the hotel director?
- No. Varian Fry.

06:08.708 --> 06:11.375
Director of the
American Emergency Rescue Committee.

06:11.375 --> 06:14.166
Several guests
are under our protection.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.958
Haven't they been through enough?
No one's breaking any laws.

06:16.958 --> 06:18.958
They are all criminal aliens, Mr. Fry.

06:18.958 --> 06:21.333
- They are refugees!
- What is the difference?

06:24.666 --> 06:27.250
Get dressed.
- What is going on?

06:27.250 --> 06:29.291
Quick. The police are here.

06:34.541 --> 06:35.583
- Please.
- Okay.

06:40.166 --> 06:41.208
Police!

06:42.500 --> 06:44.083
Police, open up!

06:52.625 --> 06:54.000
Police! Open the door!

06:54.583 --> 06:55.708
Open up! Police!

06:58.291 --> 06:59.416
Open the door!

07:02.666 --> 07:05.458
Get out! You pervert!
Get out of here!

07:05.458 --> 07:06.958
Get out of here!

07:17.291 --> 07:21.000
Oh, look! We can fit
at least three people at a time in here.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.625
I can take them down the elevator.

07:25.291 --> 07:28.125
You sure we can hide here?
We aren't hiding.

07:31.833 --> 07:32.833
Ah, shit!

07:33.333 --> 07:34.416
The espadrilles!

07:34.416 --> 07:35.666
I'll be right back.

07:38.791 --> 07:43.708
Okay. Here. These are for them,
and then you hide the rest, okay?

07:43.708 --> 07:45.166
- Thank you.
- Thank <i>you.</i>

07:45.166 --> 07:46.208
And then later?

07:46.208 --> 07:48.791
I'll come find you. Wherever you are.

07:49.416 --> 07:50.291
Good.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.458
- Where are we going?
You will see.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.083
I can't go on.

07:59.083 --> 08:01.875
I'm not finished with my book.
I need to write.

08:01.875 --> 08:05.041
Mr. Benjamin, your ideas are in here!

08:05.041 --> 08:08.208
Your life is worth more
than one damn manuscript. Understand?

08:09.625 --> 08:10.833
Yes.

08:12.875 --> 08:13.833
Shit.

08:15.583 --> 08:16.416
Let's go.

08:17.458 --> 08:19.666
Come with me.
I can't see.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.583
Silence! Quiet!

08:30.750 --> 08:31.875
Where are we?

08:32.541 --> 08:34.416
Welcome to the real Marseille.

09:09.958 --> 09:11.416
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

09:29.416 --> 09:30.791
Let's go!

09:51.583 --> 09:52.500
Hey.

09:56.583 --> 09:57.541
Thanks.

09:57.541 --> 09:59.833
Walter Benjamin, Julius Berger.
Lisa Fittko.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.750
Come with me.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.083
Here and here.

10:50.875 --> 10:54.333
André, Max,
Jacqueline, everyone just stay here,

10:54.333 --> 10:55.541
and I'll go in first.

10:58.250 --> 10:59.833
What is this place?

11:00.583 --> 11:01.875
You're dreaming, Max.

11:01.875 --> 11:04.291
I dreamed I was a suitcase.

11:04.291 --> 11:07.208
Actually, that wasn't a dream.
That really happened.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.000
Hello?

11:16.916 --> 11:18.000
Hi.

11:18.000 --> 11:18.958
Varian...

11:18.958 --> 11:22.291
No, I'm just here to ask a favor.
This is an emergency.

11:22.291 --> 11:23.583
You didn't come alone?

11:23.583 --> 11:27.041
Hello! I'm Mary Jayne Gold.
I work with Varian.

11:27.041 --> 11:28.916
Lovegrove. Thomas Lovegrove.

11:28.916 --> 11:33.208
Our hotel was just raided by the police.
I didn't know where to take the refugees.

11:33.208 --> 11:35.125
- Is this your house?
- For now.

11:35.125 --> 11:37.208
- And how many people live here?
- One.

11:37.208 --> 11:39.583
One? How many bedrooms do you have?

11:39.583 --> 11:41.041
What, ten? Fifteen?

11:41.041 --> 11:43.291
- At least.
- So can we stay here tonight?

11:43.875 --> 11:47.250
- Stay as long as you'd like.
- No. One night is all we're gonna need.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.666
- How much will you charge us?
- Hold on.

11:49.666 --> 11:53.458
Varian, think it through.
Think how many people we can hide here.

11:53.458 --> 11:55.875
We already have
the Bretons and Max Ernst with us.

11:55.875 --> 11:59.625
We can fit the Mahlers, the Manns,
even the Levines and the Fraiberg kids,

11:59.625 --> 12:02.666
and it only took us 20 minutes
to get here from the port.

12:02.666 --> 12:05.208
The ERC's won't go for us
living in a private villa.

12:05.208 --> 12:08.250
The committee is in New York!
They don't need to know.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.291
Some of our people are wanted
by the police.

12:10.291 --> 12:13.083
We may be fugitives ourselves now,
as far as we know.

12:13.083 --> 12:16.916
So we'll be hiding in plain sight.
This villa is perfect for us.

12:16.916 --> 12:20.708
It's not fair to put Thomas in danger
if he's not involved in our work.

12:20.708 --> 12:23.166
I'm pretty comfortable
with danger, actually.

12:24.375 --> 12:26.750
- I insist you stay.
It's settled.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.958
- Wanna give us a tour?
After you.

12:39.125 --> 12:44.000
Hug the dull.
Prickly thorns are below.

12:45.041 --> 12:48.583
In his slippers,
a snail has lost his armor,

12:49.333 --> 12:51.291
but he has found a mailbox.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.208
The rain falls upside down.

12:56.708 --> 12:59.833
It is blown by the currents, like ribbons.

13:00.791 --> 13:04.833
The gray-black clouds
are reflected on the skin of the sardines.

13:06.125 --> 13:10.208
Swindled, under the influence
of their lumbar pains!

13:20.958 --> 13:21.958
You okay?

13:22.583 --> 13:23.916
Are you okay?

13:23.916 --> 13:25.666
- Did they hurt you?
- No. No. No.

13:33.166 --> 13:36.583
They cleaned us out.
Not quite.

14:21.250 --> 14:24.000
All set?
- Everyone is tucked into bed.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.166
Um...

14:25.166 --> 14:26.750
- Mary Jayne.
- Mm-hmm?

14:26.750 --> 14:31.833
I think we're, uh, gonna need
even more money than we thought.

14:31.833 --> 14:34.916
We need a new office,
transportation in and out of the city...

14:34.916 --> 14:36.166
It's not a problem.

14:36.666 --> 14:38.416
- Are you sure?
- Don't worry.

14:39.291 --> 14:42.083
- I'll take care of it, Varian.
- Thank you.

14:42.083 --> 14:43.166
Mm-hmm.

14:44.541 --> 14:47.625
Feels very good to have
everybody sleeping in beds tonight,

14:47.625 --> 14:49.041
so thank you, Thomas.

14:50.375 --> 14:54.083
Uh, remind me again how we know
that you're not a Gestapo informer?

14:57.791 --> 15:00.791
Me? [laughs] I was raised on a kibbutz.

15:01.416 --> 15:06.000
Well, Fairy Godmother shows up
with an empty villa in a time of crisis,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.833
may turn out to be a wolf.

15:07.833 --> 15:11.416
No, Thomas got stuck in Europe
like everyone else when the war started.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.250
- This man is not a Gestapo informer.
- A fairy godmother, maybe.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.250
No, seriously.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.208
- I know him.
How?

15:22.333 --> 15:24.333
How do you two know each other?

15:28.458 --> 15:30.833
Five years ago, uh, in Berlin,

15:31.416 --> 15:34.791
an innocent Jewish man
was brutally attacked by Nazis in a bar.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.583
We were the only two who tried to help.

15:37.583 --> 15:41.416
He was just drinking beer.
They put a knife through his hand. Blood...

15:43.375 --> 15:46.500
I wrote about it for <i>The New York Times,</i>
and they buried it.

15:48.125 --> 15:51.250
That was the... moment that I knew

15:51.250 --> 15:52.875
that this war was gonna be

15:54.166 --> 15:56.416
different from any other war.

16:23.250 --> 16:26.500
Can I help you?
No, all good. Sit down.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.500
Not big, but comfortable.

16:31.583 --> 16:34.625
The only thing missing is
our mother's cooking.

16:36.750 --> 16:37.791
Thank you, Paul.

16:38.583 --> 16:40.375
You didn't show him
the best part.

17:06.583 --> 17:08.333
You've had a long day.

17:11.041 --> 17:12.125
That's better.

17:31.416 --> 17:33.333
We... We can't keep doing this.

17:34.708 --> 17:36.291
Is this about your wife?

17:36.291 --> 17:39.833
No. Eileen knows exactly who I am.

17:41.583 --> 17:45.583
It's Mary Jayne
and everyone else who is right next door

17:45.583 --> 17:48.000
and in bedrooms up and down this hallway.

17:49.416 --> 17:52.791
I need to keep
these two sides of my life separate.

17:56.416 --> 17:57.791
Two sides of yourself?

17:59.750 --> 18:00.750
I mean

18:01.791 --> 18:02.708
the personal

18:03.291 --> 18:05.541
and the professional.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.208
- 'Cause what would they think?

18:11.500 --> 18:14.208
The walls here are very thick.

18:14.208 --> 18:15.291
No, I'm serious.

18:19.291 --> 18:20.208
Fine.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.625
Miss Gold, I'm sorry,
but your balance doesn't cover

18:28.625 --> 18:30.750
the amount you've requested to withdraw.

18:30.750 --> 18:34.708
But I have money wired once a week
from the Second National Bank in Chicago.

18:35.625 --> 18:37.250
Nothing came in this week.

18:37.250 --> 18:41.166
Oh, well, I'm sure
that's just a misunderstanding.

18:41.166 --> 18:44.541
And while I work that out,
you could maybe advance me some cash?

18:45.041 --> 18:46.916
I'm afraid that's impossible.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.291
- I beg your pardon?
- You have no money in your account.

18:51.791 --> 18:54.708
I've been a valued client of this bank
for months.

19:13.958 --> 19:16.708
For now, this is the last of your funds.

19:23.916 --> 19:24.833
Please.

19:36.375 --> 19:37.500
Thank you!

19:47.875 --> 19:48.916
Jesus.

19:53.666 --> 19:56.500
- Think they found what they wanted?
- I hope not.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.333
Yes.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.791
- Can you help me with this?
Yeah.

20:11.333 --> 20:12.208
Just...

20:15.250 --> 20:16.083
Max Ernst.

20:22.041 --> 20:23.041
Passports.

20:33.583 --> 20:34.666
The list?

20:36.125 --> 20:36.958
Yeah.

20:48.583 --> 20:52.250
A few years ago,
we traveled the Riviera by rail.

20:52.250 --> 20:55.166
First class. My law firm
was doing excellent business.

20:55.166 --> 20:59.791
I felt like I was on top of the world.
Who knew everything could fall so far?

20:59.791 --> 21:00.958
Not me.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.916
I was offered a job in Palestine in 1933,

21:04.916 --> 21:07.791
but I turned it down.
I didn't wanna live in the desert.

21:08.916 --> 21:10.458
Maybe I made the wrong decision.

21:10.958 --> 21:15.458
So many wrong decisions
led us all to this moment.

21:15.458 --> 21:16.708
Wrong decisions...

21:18.291 --> 21:20.958
...misconstrued as a narrative of progress!

21:22.625 --> 21:24.500
I try not to look back.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.416
But I can only look back.

21:26.416 --> 21:28.666
As long as you walk forward!

21:28.666 --> 21:31.708
As we move forward,
we all leave piles of rubble.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.291
Nothing more.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.333
History

21:36.958 --> 21:41.208
is the wind blowing us forward,
turning everything in its path to rubble.

21:41.208 --> 21:42.250
Come on.

21:43.291 --> 21:44.333
Let me help you.

21:45.625 --> 21:46.833
Thank you!

21:54.375 --> 21:55.875
Where are you from?

21:57.041 --> 21:58.291
Berlin, originally.

21:58.291 --> 22:00.500
- Oh, Berlin.
- I left in '33.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.583
Where did you go?

22:04.083 --> 22:07.041
First, my older sister Ursula and I
went to Paris,

22:07.041 --> 22:10.541
then Trieste, London, Seville...

22:10.541 --> 22:11.458
Hm.

22:11.458 --> 22:13.291
...and, uh, back to Paris again.

22:13.916 --> 22:15.458
And the rest of your family?

22:18.416 --> 22:21.333
Well, my father died
just before Hitler came to power.

22:21.333 --> 22:24.708
And then, uh, my, um... Well, last I heard,

22:25.333 --> 22:28.333
my mother and my little sister Eva
were on the way to London.

22:29.833 --> 22:30.708
But...

22:31.291 --> 22:32.375
Well, the truth is

22:34.125 --> 22:35.833
I just don't know if they made it.

22:37.416 --> 22:40.000
And I also don't...
I don't know how to find out.

22:42.833 --> 22:44.291
Maybe I don't wanna find out.

23:19.166 --> 23:22.625
If you keep up like this,
we won't make it across before dawn.

23:22.625 --> 23:24.625
I am sorry. I can't go any faster.

23:25.666 --> 23:26.916
Then we should turn back.

23:27.416 --> 23:29.000
All the way back to Banyuls?

23:29.625 --> 23:31.833
There is a stone house
we can sleep in.

23:32.333 --> 23:35.083
We passed it a little while back.
It's not far.

23:35.791 --> 23:40.291
I can't go back to that house.
I'd rather stay the night here.

23:41.875 --> 23:42.750
Here?

23:47.583 --> 23:50.000
Right here.

23:54.250 --> 23:55.916
We'll pick you up at dawn.

24:05.625 --> 24:06.541
Good night.

24:16.125 --> 24:18.833
Doesn't it get to you?
What?

24:19.666 --> 24:23.125
There's starving people
sleeping on the beach ten yards from here.

24:23.833 --> 24:27.083
This country's going down the crapper,
pardon my French.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.000
No wonder your father wants you home.

24:35.791 --> 24:38.291
They don't have
champagne like this in Chicago.

24:38.291 --> 24:39.875
Is that why you're still here?

24:42.500 --> 24:43.791
Did you speak to him?

24:45.875 --> 24:46.833
Not yet.

24:49.791 --> 24:51.791
What did he say when you didn't show up?

24:52.750 --> 24:53.666
He cut me off.

24:55.875 --> 24:59.541
Will you speak with him? Please?
Tell him there's nothing to worry about.

25:03.333 --> 25:05.583
Problem is, I agree with him.

25:05.583 --> 25:07.875
Do you really want me to leave, Graham?

25:09.041 --> 25:10.666
- Me?
- Yes.

25:11.500 --> 25:13.500
You're not gonna miss me when I'm gone?

25:53.583 --> 25:54.833
Mr. Benjamin.

25:57.458 --> 25:58.458
Mr. Benjamin?

26:02.333 --> 26:03.291
Mr. Benjamin!

26:03.291 --> 26:05.250
What is going on?

26:05.250 --> 26:10.541
I took some morphine

26:11.791 --> 26:13.458
to help me sleep.

26:14.583 --> 26:16.708
You shouldn't mess around with that stuff.

26:16.708 --> 26:19.250
Don't worry.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

26:20.916 --> 26:22.291
Good morning.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
So...

26:28.541 --> 26:29.625
let's go.

26:58.125 --> 26:59.125
Mr. Benjamin...

27:50.000 --> 27:52.583
Where have you been?
- Working.

27:55.333 --> 27:57.833
- How'd you get out here?
With Varian.

27:58.750 --> 27:59.625
We, um...

27:59.625 --> 28:01.500
We found an office yesterday.

28:02.125 --> 28:04.750
We furnished it and everything.
It's ready to go.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.875
We already started arranging interviews.

28:07.958 --> 28:09.250
Word is spreading.

28:09.250 --> 28:10.333
That's great.

28:12.333 --> 28:14.416
- Yeah.
So are you coming in?

28:17.375 --> 28:20.000
You live here,
but you didn't spend the night here.

28:21.916 --> 28:24.833
I'm staying here, Albert.
You're welcome to stay here too.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.083
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

28:26.083 --> 28:29.791
In a mansion half an hour
from all the people we're trying to help.

28:29.791 --> 28:33.416
Hm. Maybe I'm just more comfortable
in a place like this than you are.

28:34.250 --> 28:37.625
This place only has 26 rooms,
and the house I grew up in has 30, so...

28:42.166 --> 28:43.666
MJ, hey.

28:44.458 --> 28:46.375
Please. Can you just...

28:48.541 --> 28:49.416
I...

28:51.666 --> 28:53.500
I came out here to see you.

28:57.416 --> 29:00.958
- I really need to take a bath right now.
- Okay. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

29:11.791 --> 29:13.541
Transit visas, <i>por favor.</i>

29:30.625 --> 29:32.666
Something's wrong.

29:33.333 --> 29:34.541
Stay calm.

29:45.500 --> 29:49.250
The border was closed
yesterday. How did you get over here?

29:50.000 --> 29:51.625
The French let us through.

29:57.250 --> 30:00.750
There's a hotel next door.
Stay there until this is resolved.

30:08.083 --> 30:11.333
God, I need a cigarette.
Can I have one?

30:15.916 --> 30:18.791
Hm. Thank you. Thank you.

30:29.458 --> 30:30.875
How was your night?

30:33.958 --> 30:37.416
Oh, don't be coy.
You seem like a modern woman.

30:39.416 --> 30:42.291
A modern woman
with a Presbyterian conscience.

30:43.083 --> 30:45.625
My father's frozen my trust.
No more money.

30:46.166 --> 30:48.583
- Why?
- He's trying to force me to go home.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.166
He misses you that much?

30:53.375 --> 30:56.666
Hardly. No. No.
He's just worried about his reputation.

30:56.666 --> 31:01.416
God forbid his daughter be going around
Marseille with the unwashed masses.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.666
You know what's gonna happen if I go home?

31:09.250 --> 31:11.958
My mother is gonna scrape
the bottom of Lake Michigan

31:11.958 --> 31:17.666
to find any corpse or divorcé
willing to marry her spinster daughter.

31:18.750 --> 31:21.541
And then I am going to spend
the rest of my life

31:21.541 --> 31:24.083
at the club playing bridge.

31:30.291 --> 31:33.041
But if I go back, he unfreezes my trust,

31:34.250 --> 31:36.875
and I could send Varian money
from Chicago.

31:37.708 --> 31:40.958
I could help pay for the new offices.
I could feed everybody here.

31:40.958 --> 31:44.166
I could get train tickets and...

31:45.333 --> 31:49.083
I don't know. Maybe the rescue committee
needs money more than it needs me.

31:50.916 --> 31:52.958
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

31:54.208 --> 31:55.500
Please don't tell Varian.

31:55.500 --> 32:00.333
I... I promise I will figure something out
before I have to let him down.

32:00.333 --> 32:01.916
Maybe you don't have to.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.000
Don't have to what?

32:06.875 --> 32:09.875
Go home or let anyone down.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.250
Mr. Benjamin.

32:21.166 --> 32:22.375
My manuscript...

32:24.500 --> 32:26.875
has to make it to America.

32:28.666 --> 32:30.875
Remember my briefcase, will you?

32:31.500 --> 32:34.916
You will carry that briefcase
to America yourself, Mr. Benjamin.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.708
With or without me.

32:43.166 --> 32:44.208
Promise me?

32:46.250 --> 32:47.291
I promise.

33:17.500 --> 33:21.375
<i>I was born in Bulgaria.
I moved to Hamburg after high school.</i>

33:22.041 --> 33:24.666
<i>I met my wife, Jana, on the bus.</i>

33:24.666 --> 33:27.583
<i>I had to leave
with our neighbors to France,</i>

33:28.500 --> 33:30.333
<i>but now I don't know where they are.</i>

33:30.333 --> 33:32.333
<i>I was born with nothing.</i>

33:32.333 --> 33:33.250
<i>Every job I had,</i>

33:33.250 --> 33:34.583
I was the best.

33:34.583 --> 33:37.500
Then I built my own factory, then another.

33:38.875 --> 33:41.083
I treated my workers with dignity.

33:42.208 --> 33:43.583
I paid my taxes.

33:43.583 --> 33:46.125
I lived with my sister. I work at home.

33:47.291 --> 33:49.625
One day, I was told
they were coming for us.

33:49.625 --> 33:52.666
My husband and son
were killed in the Nazis' invasion.

33:54.666 --> 33:56.708
For some reason, they left me alive.

33:57.291 --> 33:59.958
And they were all gone.
My brother.

34:01.291 --> 34:02.166
My sister.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.416
My mother.

34:04.416 --> 34:06.750
I don't know
what has happened to my brother.

34:07.333 --> 34:11.666
Are you a professional artist,
a politician, or a published academic?

34:12.625 --> 34:15.958
- No.
- I'm European. We are all Europeans.

34:15.958 --> 34:16.958
I'm a seamstress.

34:16.958 --> 34:18.083
I'm a mother.

34:18.083 --> 34:21.166
And our parents are dead.
I don't have any family now.

34:21.166 --> 34:22.500
Can you help me?

34:22.500 --> 34:23.666
I must go to America.

34:23.666 --> 34:25.833
I will do anything to save my family.

34:25.833 --> 34:27.666
Can you help?
- Can you help me?

34:27.666 --> 34:29.291
- Can you help?
- Please help me.

34:29.291 --> 34:33.125
I just need somewhere safe
while all this madness ends.

34:33.125 --> 34:34.375
Can you help us?

34:34.375 --> 34:39.166
Are you a professional artist,
a politician, or a published academic?

34:39.166 --> 34:40.791
Can I borrow a pencil?

34:41.916 --> 34:42.916
Please.

35:07.375 --> 35:08.666
What do you think?

35:12.875 --> 35:15.000
I really like it.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.291
I don't just do caricatures.
I can draw anything.

35:22.416 --> 35:24.708
- I don't know that we can help you.
Please.

35:26.041 --> 35:27.250
Maybe I can help you.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.083
I went to art school.
I was the first in my class.

35:31.583 --> 35:33.708
I'm sorry. Can you excuse me for a moment?

35:53.666 --> 35:54.541
Varian?

35:55.250 --> 35:57.666
- Yeah?
- Someone from the consulate called.

35:59.916 --> 36:01.083
Patterson?

36:01.083 --> 36:02.375
One of his deputies.

36:03.458 --> 36:04.666
He said it's urgent.

36:13.708 --> 36:16.958
Are you sure it isn't a trap?
- The Spanish are letting us go.

36:16.958 --> 36:19.458
We have to get on the train
before they change their minds.

36:19.458 --> 36:20.833
Where's Mr. Benjamin?

36:24.250 --> 36:25.291
Mr. Benjamin!

36:26.041 --> 36:27.958
Wake up! They are letting us go.

36:35.125 --> 36:36.750
Mr. Benjamin, wake up!

36:41.875 --> 36:43.333
Mr. Benjamin, wake up!

36:48.458 --> 36:49.416
Walter...

37:04.916 --> 37:07.541
<i>In a situation
presenting no way out,</i>

37:07.541 --> 37:11.416
<i>I have no other choice
but to make an end of it.</i>

37:11.416 --> 37:12.916
Damn it!

37:17.041 --> 37:19.458
<i>My life will come to a close</i>

37:19.458 --> 37:23.833
<i>in a small village in the Pyrenees,
where no one knows who I am.</i>

37:23.833 --> 37:26.041
Lisa, our train.

37:30.375 --> 37:31.500
You're right.

37:45.958 --> 37:48.625
Mr. Fry.
- I recognize you.

37:48.625 --> 37:50.083
The vice-consul?

37:50.583 --> 37:53.041
- Bingham. Hiram Bingham.
- Mm-hmm.

37:53.041 --> 37:55.625
Um, well, thank you for meeting me here.

37:55.625 --> 37:57.833
I wanted to make sure
no one could hear us.

37:57.833 --> 38:01.166
- Mr. Bingham, I have to get back to work.
- Of course. Uh...

38:01.166 --> 38:04.583
I wanted to explain
our new policy in person.

38:04.583 --> 38:08.333
New policy? Jesus, we're having
a hard time keeping up with the old one.

38:08.333 --> 38:11.291
- Just hear me out.
- We have our hands full.

38:11.291 --> 38:14.416
The only good news I have is
we got Walter Benjamin out.

38:14.416 --> 38:16.333
Well, that is very good news.

38:17.625 --> 38:18.458
Uh...

38:19.083 --> 38:21.041
Mr. Patterson doesn't know I'm here.

38:25.291 --> 38:29.083
From now on, our new visa policy is
you come directly to me.

38:30.291 --> 38:31.291
Why is that?

38:32.125 --> 38:37.041
Patterson's not sympathetic to your cause.
This morning, he said to me, and I quote,

38:37.541 --> 38:41.833
"No pinkos, no British POWs, no Jews.
Do I have to spell it out for you?"

38:43.500 --> 38:46.041
I don't know
what you're hearing from New York.

38:48.291 --> 38:52.333
Well, I know that the <i>Kindertransport</i>
to England has been called off.

38:53.083 --> 38:56.708
And there's zero appetite stateside
for taking in refugee children.

38:58.500 --> 39:03.583
My wife was at a party in D.C. recently
where some socialite made a joke about it.

39:04.750 --> 39:06.250
A thousand Jewish children?

39:06.250 --> 39:10.666
"Well, they're just gonna grow up to be
a thousand ugly adults," she said.

39:14.458 --> 39:18.333
You know, the American government
is deliberately stalling

39:18.333 --> 39:20.833
because no one cares
all hell's breaking loose.

39:20.833 --> 39:23.500
You need to get as many people out
as possible now.

39:23.500 --> 39:24.833
Yeah, you're telling me.

39:25.500 --> 39:28.541
Good to know we still have
some friends inside the consulate.

39:28.541 --> 39:30.291
Not friends, Mr. Fry.

39:31.791 --> 39:32.666
Just me.

40:22.375 --> 40:23.500
Don't be nervous.

40:24.416 --> 40:26.750
My boss will answer all your questions.

40:28.833 --> 40:29.833
Where is he?

40:30.958 --> 40:31.958
Right here.

40:35.041 --> 40:35.875
Mary Jayne,

40:36.666 --> 40:37.500
meet Margaux.

40:38.250 --> 40:39.250
Hello.

40:46.083 --> 40:48.458
- Do you smoke?
- Oh, no, thank you.

40:49.208 --> 40:51.333
Hm. Too bad.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.750
There's more where this came from.

41:01.291 --> 41:02.291
Work with us.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.125
Uh...

41:05.125 --> 41:06.333
Work with you?

41:06.333 --> 41:07.500
As a spy?

41:07.500 --> 41:09.000
I haven't been trained.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.083
No?

41:12.166 --> 41:15.541
Surely, you know how to bend yourself
around a man so he feels comfortable,

41:15.541 --> 41:16.791
even if you don't.

41:18.791 --> 41:20.333
Uh... I'm sorry, what?

41:22.500 --> 41:26.291
To make absolutely sure you're not taking
too much space in a room?

41:26.291 --> 41:27.750
I...

41:27.750 --> 41:31.000
How about swallowing your feelings
when they're inconvenient,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.583
or holding your tongue
when you're furious?

41:34.500 --> 41:37.166
I'm guessing you're the type
who remembers people's birthdays,

41:37.166 --> 41:41.291
their favorite songs,
and all kinds of other personal details

41:41.291 --> 41:43.083
without being asked to do so.

41:44.750 --> 41:45.625
Am I wrong?

41:46.208 --> 41:47.708
Thank you<i>.</i>
- Voilà.

41:49.666 --> 41:53.291
If you tell me
you don't play down your own intelligence

41:53.291 --> 41:56.333
in situations where it might be perceived
as threatening,

41:56.333 --> 41:57.416
well...

41:59.166 --> 42:00.375
I won't believe you.

42:05.208 --> 42:08.750
I'd say you've spent your whole life
training for this, Miss Gold.

42:11.791 --> 42:12.833
Haven't we all?
