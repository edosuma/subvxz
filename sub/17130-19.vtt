WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:03.804
(chatting indistinctly)

00:03.804 --> 00:05.339
(gasps) LOOK AT MAX.

00:05.339 --> 00:08.042
HE KNOWS HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE ON THE INTERNET

00:08.042 --> 00:09.910
WHEN WE'RE NOT AT HOME.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.712
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S LOOKING AT?

00:11.712 --> 00:14.382
I DON'T KNOW. HE'S A BOY.
HE'S 14. HE'S ALONE.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.750
I'M SURE HE'S CHECKING
HIS STOCKS.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.486
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S LOOKING AT, ANGIE?

00:18.486 --> 00:20.554
THAT'S A MAGIC BOX
FULL OF NAKED WOMEN.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.356
(gasps)

00:22.356 --> 00:23.757
OH, WELL,
WE'LL NEVER SEE.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.959
HE'S SO FAST,
THE SECOND WE GO IN THERE,

00:25.959 --> 00:28.096
HE'S GONNA SIGN OFF.
NOT THIS TIME.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.302
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

00:34.302 --> 00:35.836
IT'S NOT A WEB SITE.

00:35.836 --> 00:38.005
HE'S TALKING ONLINE
TO SOMEBODY NAMED "Z-GIRL."

00:38.005 --> 00:41.041
RELAX, THAT'S ZOEY.
SHE'S 13. SHE LIVES IN CHICAGO.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.043
I MET HER
IN A CHAT ROOM.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.545
MAX,
THIS IS THE INTERNET.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.547
FOR ALL YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD BE TALKING

00:46.547 --> 00:49.049
TO SOME OLD DUDE WHO STANDS
AT THE WINDOW ALL DAY,

00:49.049 --> 00:51.652
WEARING BOXERS
AND EATING CEREAL.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.322
MR. VASQUEZ,
ACROSS THE STREET?

00:54.322 --> 00:56.324
YES. HE WATCHED ME
MOW THE LAWN YESTERDAY.

00:56.324 --> 00:59.026
IT WAS HOT,
BUT I PUT MY SHIRT BACK ON

00:59.026 --> 01:02.863
BECAUSE NO ONE
GETS THIS SHOW FOR FREE.

01:02.863 --> 01:06.033
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE NOISE?
YOU JUST WOKE ME UP.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.535
YOU LEFT MAX ALONE.

01:07.535 --> 01:10.037
HE WAS TALKING TO SOME STRANGER
ON THE INTERNET.

01:10.037 --> 01:11.839
WE PAY YOU
TO WATCH OUR KIDS,

01:11.839 --> 01:14.708
NOT GET DRUNK
AND PASS OUT ON THE COUCH.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.145
HEY, I'M 1-FOR-2.
CARMEN'S OKAY.

01:17.145 --> 01:19.280
IS SHE STILL HERE?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.682
DON'T WORRY, OKAY?

01:21.682 --> 01:26.354
THE WAY SHE WAS DRESSED,
SHE WILL GET A RIDE HOME.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.356
CAN I PLEASE
GET BACK ON THE INTERNET?

01:28.356 --> 01:30.991
I CAN SHOW YOU
ZOEY'S A GIRL.

01:30.991 --> 01:32.693
SHE SENT ME HER PICTURE.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.728
THAT PICTURE
COULD BE FAKE.

01:34.728 --> 01:38.266
ERNIE USES ANTONIO BANDERAS'
PICTURE TO PICK UP WOMEN ONLINE.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.000
THEN WHEN HE MEETS THEM,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.237
HE TELLS 'EM HE GAINED WEIGHT
FOR "ZORRO, THE LATER YEARS."

01:43.237 --> 01:45.639
DAD, YOU'RE WRONG.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.408
ZOEY'S A GIRL,
AND SHE GETS ME.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.743
SHE L-O-Ls
AT ALL OF MY JOKES.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.745
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
THE TYPE OF PERSON

01:51.745 --> 01:53.947
YOU'RE REALLY
TALKING TO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:53.947 --> 01:56.317
PRETENDING TO BE YOU.
WHAT'S YOUR SCREEN NAME?

01:56.317 --> 01:59.387
"RIPPED-TO-THE-MAX."

01:59.387 --> 02:02.223
OH, QUE LA. THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING YOU RIPPED.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.158
(makes buzzing sound)

02:08.829 --> 02:09.963
(sighs)

02:09.963 --> 02:13.801
DUDE, I THINK THE TWINS
ARE SWITCHING ON US.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.270
WHY WOULD
THEY DO THAT?
THEY'RE TESTING US.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.339
THEY WANNA MAKE SURE THAT
WE KNOW THEY'RE DIFFERENT,

02:18.339 --> 02:21.575
THAT THEY EACH HAVE
UNIQUE PERSONALITIES.

02:23.944 --> 02:27.147
TAKE THIS, AND YOU PUT
A MARK ON ONE OF 'EM

02:27.147 --> 02:29.450
SO WE CAN
TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

02:29.450 --> 02:35.223
YOU WANT ME
TO BRAND MY DATE?

02:35.223 --> 02:36.390
(instant messenger chimes)

02:41.229 --> 02:42.730
"WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?"

02:42.730 --> 02:44.732
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M CHATTING WITH SOMEONE.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.800
YEAH, SOMEONE WHO WANTS
TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WEARING.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.269
WHO ASKS THAT?

02:48.269 --> 02:49.703
I ASK THAT.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.173
YOU SEE?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.543
CREEPY.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.078
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MAX.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.680
WHO'S MAX?

02:59.680 --> 03:00.981
RELAX. HE'S 14.

03:00.981 --> 03:04.051
HE'S MY FRIEND WHO LIVES
IN CALIFORNIA. I MET HIM ONLINE.

03:04.051 --> 03:06.754
WHAT, ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

03:06.754 --> 03:09.257
WHAT KIND OF PERVERTS
HANG OUT IN THESE CHAT ROOMS.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.359
PEOPLE LIE ABOUT THEMSELVES
ALL THE TIME, ZOE.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.394
YEAH, AND NOT JUST
ON THE INTERNET.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.063
I, UH,
KNOW A GUY WHO, UH,

03:16.063 --> 03:19.099
PRETENDED TO BE HOMELESS
SO HE COULD MEET THIS HOT GIRL

03:19.099 --> 03:21.469
WHO WORKED
AT A SOUP KITCHEN.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.673
(sighs) I TOTALLY HAD HER

03:25.673 --> 03:27.975
UNTIL I INVITED HER BACK
TO MY PENTHOUSE.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.179
LET'S SEE HOW OLD
MAX REALLY IS.

03:32.179 --> 03:33.881
UNCLE FREDDIE!

03:33.881 --> 03:35.549
I'M-A BEAT YOU.

03:40.187 --> 03:44.425
"ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE 14?

03:44.425 --> 03:46.760
"'CAUSE YOU SOUND
WAY MORE MATURE

03:46.760 --> 03:50.097
THAN ANY 14-YEAR-OLD I KNOW."

03:50.097 --> 03:52.099
YOU KNOW
HE CAN'T HEAR YOU.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.701
I'M IN CHARACTER!

03:58.306 --> 04:00.240
"I AM MATURE FOR MY AGE.

04:00.240 --> 04:04.378
I DO LOTS OF ADULT THINGS."

04:04.378 --> 04:05.846
"ADULT THINGS"?

04:05.846 --> 04:09.550
OH, COME ON,
THIS IS NO 14-YEAR-OLD.

04:09.550 --> 04:12.286
"YEAH, I'M WITH YOU.

04:12.286 --> 04:15.323
"PEOPLE ONLY
MAKE AGE A BIG DEAL

04:15.323 --> 04:17.391
"'CAUSE THEY'RE
TRYING TO STOP YOU

04:17.391 --> 04:20.961
FROM DOING STUFF
THAT'S... FUN."

04:20.961 --> 04:22.162
THERE IT IS.

04:22.162 --> 04:26.233
YOU SEE THAT, MAX?
ANYTHING "FUN" IS SEXUAL.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.235
TRUE DAT.

04:28.235 --> 04:31.372
DAD, THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE ZOEY.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.673
BECAUSE I TRICKED "ZOEY"

04:32.673 --> 04:34.542
INTO REVEALING
HIS TRUE IDENTITY.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.276
NOW I'M-A DRAW HIM OUT.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.479
"I LIKE TO DO FUN THINGS, TOO,

04:38.479 --> 04:41.148
"LIKE SKATEBOARDING,
VIDEO GAMES.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.149
"OH...

04:42.149 --> 04:44.452
TICKLE PARTIES."

04:46.554 --> 04:49.357
THIS GUY'S A SICKO!

04:51.359 --> 04:55.729
OKAY, LET'S SEE IF HE'LL
GIVE UP WHERE HE LIVES.

04:55.729 --> 05:00.233
"IF YOU TELL ME
THE ADDRESS OF THIS...

05:00.233 --> 05:02.570
"TICKLE PARTY,

05:02.570 --> 05:07.174
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE
MY TICKLE SPOT IS."

05:07.174 --> 05:08.476
(gasps)

05:08.476 --> 05:10.277
"TICKLE SPOT"?
THAT'S NOT A GIRL!

05:10.277 --> 05:13.447
THEY NEVER TELL YOU WHERE IT IS.
THEY TRY TO MAKE YOU FIND IT.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.883
AND WHEN YOU CAN'T,
THEY MAKE YOU FEEL BAD.

05:18.051 --> 05:21.955
"GIVE ME YOUR ADDRESS,
AND I'LL GIVE YOU MINE."

05:21.955 --> 05:23.123
(scoffs)

05:23.123 --> 05:24.658
"SURE...

05:24.658 --> 05:27.327
"JUST GIVE ME YOURS FIRST."

05:27.327 --> 05:28.962
THAT'S IT!

05:28.962 --> 05:32.099
HE'S KNOW I'M ON TO HIM,
BUT HE WON'T BREAK.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.901
(instant messenger logs off)

05:33.901 --> 05:37.137
I KNEW IT.
I SPOOKED HIM AWAY.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.507
(both) I'LL BET WITH
THIS GUY'S E-MAIL ADDRESS,

05:39.507 --> 05:41.509
I CAN FIND OUT
WHERE HE LIVES.

05:41.509 --> 05:44.344
I'M GONNA
CALL THE COPS ON YOUR ASS!

05:44.344 --> 05:47.481
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

05:51.151 --> 05:53.020
* ALL MY FRIENDS

05:53.020 --> 05:56.590
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

05:58.191 --> 05:59.560
* THE LOW RIDER

05:59.560 --> 06:03.030
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

06:14.708 --> 06:18.278
OFFICER, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE TAKING ME SERIOUSLY.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.113
IS SHE TALKING
TO A POLICE?

06:20.113 --> 06:23.216
YEAH, WE THINK A GUY'S
STALKING MAX ON THE INTERNET.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.952
AY, DIOS MIO,
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.987
AT LEAST IN CUBA,
THERE WAS NO INTERNET

06:26.987 --> 06:29.757
WITH STRANGERS
TRYING TO LURE YOU AWAY.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.426
IF AN OLD MAN
PUT HIS HAND IN YOUR PANTS,

06:32.426 --> 06:34.728
HE WAS LOOKING FOR FOOD.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.431
WHY WERE YOU WALKING AROUND
WITH FOOD IN YOUR PANTS?

06:37.431 --> 06:39.633
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
USE A PAPER BAG?

06:39.633 --> 06:43.604
AND LEAVE MY DAD
WITHOUT A BRIEFCASE?

06:43.604 --> 06:45.806
I DON'T THINK SO.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.110
MAX, GET DOWN HERE!

06:51.612 --> 06:54.582
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SWAMPED,
DETECTIVE, BUT--

06:54.582 --> 06:56.517
1,500 CASES?

06:56.517 --> 06:58.519
NO WONDER YOU'RE SO BEHIND.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.654
GIVE ME THE PHONE.
YOU'RE BEING TOO NICE.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.658
MY SON IS BEING STALKED
ON THE INTERNET.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.660
NO, I CAN'T PROVE
THE GUY'S AN ADULT.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.963
THAT'S YOUR JOB! GET OFF
YOUR LAZY BUTT AND DO IT!

07:09.963 --> 07:12.700
DON'T THREATEN ME
WITH UNPAID TICKETS.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.402
THERE ARE A LOT
OF "GEORGE LOPEZ's" IN L.A.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.771
JUST TRY TO FIND ME!

07:17.771 --> 07:19.072
YEAH,
THAT'S MY ADDRESS.

07:19.072 --> 07:22.242
BUT WHAT ROOM
AM I CALLING YOU FROM?

07:22.242 --> 07:23.210
DAMN IT!

07:24.878 --> 07:28.949
THE COPS AREN'T GONNA HELP US.
WE'RE ON OUR OWN.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.951
OKAY, I PUT A FILTER
ON THE COMPUTER,

07:30.951 --> 07:33.320
SO NOW
YOU CAN USE IT AGAIN.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.490
FINALLY. YOU KNOW, IF I GET
AN "F" ON MY HISTORY REPORT,

07:36.490 --> 07:39.693
IT'S 'CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T LET ME
DO RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.830
YOU COULD'VE GONE TO THE LIBRARY
AND OPENED UP A BOOK.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.566
WHY IS EVERYTHING
A JOKE TO YOU?

07:45.566 --> 07:49.537
OKAY, BUT FROM NOW ON,
YOU CAN'T I.M. ANYONE

07:49.537 --> 07:51.539
OR GO INTO ANY CHAT ROOM
WITHOUT MY APPROVAL.

07:51.539 --> 07:54.241
AND ONLY I KNOW
THE SECRET PASSWORD.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.977
IS IT "WAAPAHH"?

07:59.279 --> 08:00.881
NOT ANYMORE.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.786
THIS ISN'T FAIR.
WHY CAN'T YOU GUYS TRUST ME?

08:05.786 --> 08:10.323
MAX, HONEY, YOU'RE ONLY 14.
YOU'RE STILL A LITTLE NAIVE.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.892
NO, I'M NOT!

08:11.892 --> 08:14.862
MAX, I GET YOU EVERY TIME
WITH THAT FAKE STAIN THING.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.064
I WOULD DO IT RIGHT NOW

08:17.064 --> 08:19.767
IF YOU DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE
A BIG ONE RIGHT THERE. HELLO!

08:19.767 --> 08:21.769
WELL,
AT LEAST I'M NOT THE GUY

08:21.769 --> 08:24.972
WHO HAS MAGIC UNDERWEAR
TO HELP THE RAIDERS WIN.

08:24.972 --> 08:29.910
HEY, I KNOW MY UNDERWEAR
DON'T HAVE ANY MAGIC POWERS...

08:29.910 --> 08:33.013
NOT SINCE SOMEONE BLEACHED
THE MAGIC RIGHT OUT OF 'EM.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.550
SPRING FRESHNESS.
ESTÃ¡ LOCA, SPRING FRESHNESS!

08:37.985 --> 08:40.087
MOM AND DAD WON'T
LET ME USE THE INTERNET.

08:40.087 --> 08:43.156
THEY THINK I'M TALKING
TO SOME OLD PERV.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.758
WELL, THAT'S SAD.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.760
THERE'S A DESPERATE OLD PERV
OUT THERE

08:46.760 --> 08:49.462
WHO CAN'T ANYONE BUT YOU?

08:49.462 --> 08:51.865
IT'S A GIRL.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.835
HEY, CAN I USE YOUR CELL PHONE
TO E-MAIL HER?

08:54.835 --> 08:55.603
UM...

08:55.603 --> 08:57.270
NORMALLY, I'D SAY NO,

08:57.270 --> 09:00.540
BUT THERE'S A CHANCE YOU COULD
BE WRONG AND GET ABDUCTED.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.709
SO HERE.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.618
(instant messenger chimes)

09:15.723 --> 09:17.024
"SORRY ABOUT THAT.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.728
MY PARENTS
KICKED ME OFF THE COMPUTER."

09:20.728 --> 09:22.495
(instant messenger chimes)

09:22.495 --> 09:25.833
"THAT'S OKAY. MY UNCLE HAS
A BUSINESS TRIP TO L.A.,

09:25.833 --> 09:27.735
"AND I'M GONNA ASK
IF I CAN GO WITH HIM.

09:27.735 --> 09:30.037
WE CAN ACTUALLY MEET."

09:32.239 --> 09:36.977
"THAT WOULD
BE COOLZZAAAABBBTTAAG."

09:39.613 --> 09:40.914
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

09:40.914 --> 09:43.684
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO TALK TO THIS GUY ANYMORE.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.486
MAX, YOU'RE GROUNDED.
DAD, STOP FREAKING OUT.
IT'S A GIRL.

09:46.486 --> 09:48.822
THIS IS HOW
PEOPLE MY AGE HOOK UP.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.824
IT'S NOT LIKE WHEN
YOU AND MOM WERE DATING.

09:50.824 --> 09:54.061
YOU JUST WENT DOWN TO THE DISCO
AND DID THE TOOT.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.563
LET'S MAKE ONE THING CLEAR--

09:56.563 --> 09:58.331
YOUR MOTHER
AND I NEVER DID DRUGS,

09:58.331 --> 10:01.334
AND WE NEVER EVER
SET FOOT IN A DISCO.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.571
THIS IS A METAL FAMILY.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.573
THAT'S WHY YOUR NAME IS MAX--

10:06.573 --> 10:08.575
THE LOUDEST SETTING
ON AN AMPLIFIER.

10:08.575 --> 10:11.311
YOU WERE ALMOST
"REVERB LOPEZ."

10:11.311 --> 10:13.113
DAD, I'M GONNA TALK TO ZOEY.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.316
I'LL JUST USE ONE OF MY FRIEND'S
PHONES AT SCHOOL IF I HAVE TO.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.685
YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.953
YEAH,
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.955
WELL,
YOU RAISED YOUR VOICE

10:21.955 --> 10:24.758
AND YOU GAVE HIM
A VAGUE THREAT.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.059
WHOO!

10:26.059 --> 10:28.061
YOU DID EVERYTHING
THEY TOLD YOU TO DO

10:28.061 --> 10:31.331
IN "WEAK PARENTING"
MAGAZINE.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.833
NO, PLEASE, PLEASE.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.002
DON'T GIVE ME THAT
DISAPPOINTED LOOK.

10:35.002 --> 10:38.505
IT AFFECTS
MY SELF-ESTEEM.

10:38.505 --> 10:42.042
I THINK SEEING YOU CLIMBING OUT
OF A TRUCKER'S CAB AT DAWN

10:42.042 --> 10:46.313
WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON BACKWARDS
WOULD TAKE CARE OF THAT.

10:46.313 --> 10:50.517
OH, MAN, THE GUY AFTER MAX
IS COMING TO L.A.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.319
ALL RIGHT, FOOL,
COME OUT HERE.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.122
I'LL SET A TRAP AND TAKE CARE
OF YOU ONCE AND FOR ALL.

10:55.122 --> 10:58.025
ZOEY, I SAID I DON'T
WANT YOU TALKING TO THIS GUY.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.727
HE'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.461
YOU'LL SEE WHEN
WE MEET HIM IN L.A.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.263
WE? NAH.
NAH, NAH, NAH, NAH, NAH.

11:03.263 --> 11:06.199
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
THIS IS A BUSINESS TRIP.

11:06.199 --> 11:09.136
THEN WHY ARE YOU TAKING
CHRIS WITH YOU?

11:09.136 --> 11:11.504
BECAUSE HE'S
MY BUSINESS PARTNER.

11:11.504 --> 11:15.308
AND I CAN GET HIM
INTO THE PLAYBOY MANSION.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.245
DUDE, YOU SCORED THAT?

11:18.245 --> 11:20.948
COME ON, MAN.
YOU KNOW HOW SMOOTH I AM.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.950
I JUST CALLED THEM UP.
I WAS LIKE,

11:22.950 --> 11:25.685
"YO, CHRIS AND FREDDIE
ARE ROLLING INTO TOWN."

11:25.685 --> 11:27.320
HOW MUCH?

11:27.320 --> 11:30.323
5 GRAND APIECE, AND WE'RE
GAY DESIGNERS FROM GERMANY.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.897
BUT NOT SO GAY
WE CAN'T BE TURNED.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.401
(instant messenger chimes)

11:41.401 --> 11:42.836
AH, AH, AH, AH.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.240
"I CAN'T WAIT
TO MEET YOU IN L.A.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.077
I EVEN KNOW A PLACE
WHERE WE CAN BE ALONE."

11:50.077 --> 11:52.645
THIS GUY DOESN'T GIVE UP.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.281
ALL RIGHT, DIRTBAG.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.853
"SOUNDS GREAT. I'LL E-MAIL YOU
WHEN I GET THERE."

11:59.853 --> 12:01.855
WHEN THIS GUY GETS
TO ERNIE'S APARTMENT, MOM,

12:01.855 --> 12:03.857
I'M GONNA BEAT
THE CRAP OUT OF HIM.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.994
(laughs) YEAH.
WANT ME THERE FOR BACKUP?

12:06.994 --> 12:08.996
YOU KNOW, MOM, I WOULD,

12:08.996 --> 12:12.165
BUT AT ERNIE'S APARTMENT,
THEY DON'T ALLOW PETS.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.467
I THINK
I CAN HANDLE THIS MYSELF.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.969
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

12:15.969 --> 12:18.105
COME ON, GEORGE.
YOU GOT YOUR LUNCH MONEY STOLEN

12:18.105 --> 12:22.209
BY THAT LITTLE GIRL NEXT DOOR
WHO HAD A HOLE IN HER HEART.

12:22.209 --> 12:26.179
HEY, WHEN YOU GOT NOTHING
TO LOSE, YOU FIGHT THAT WAY.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.181
I THOUGHT HER OXYGEN TANK
WOULD SLOW HER DOWN,

12:28.181 --> 12:32.352
BUT SHE WRAPPED THAT HOSE AROUND
MY NECK, AND I WAS ALL LIKE...

12:43.330 --> 12:45.765
HEY. HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM THE PREDATOR?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.067
IS HE IN L.A. YET?

12:47.067 --> 12:48.936
SHH! NO, MAN,
KEEP IT DOWN.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.204
I DIDN'T TELL ANGIE BECAUSE
I DON'T WANT HER TO WORRY.
YEAH.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.974
HEY, IT'S SCARY WITH ALL THOSE
CREEPS ON THE INTERNET.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.976
THINGS WERE A LOT SIMPLER
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.979
YOU KNEW WHO THE BAD GUYS WERE.
THEY'D SHOW UP IN A VAN

12:58.979 --> 13:01.414
AND ASK YOU TO HELP THEM
FIND YOUR PUPPY, YOU KNOW?

13:01.414 --> 13:03.516
THAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

13:03.516 --> 13:05.285
NO, I WAS TOO FAT.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.287
YEAH, THE VAN SLOWED DOWN
AND LOOKED AT ME,

13:07.287 --> 13:09.289
BUT THEN
KEPT RIGHT ON GOING.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.291
I TRIED
TO JUMP IN ONE TIME,

13:11.291 --> 13:13.493
BUT THE VATO LOCKED THE DOOR
FROM THE INSIDE.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.995
(instant messenger chimes)

13:14.995 --> 13:16.997
HE'S HERE.

13:16.997 --> 13:20.033
"I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET YOU.

13:20.033 --> 13:23.503
"I'M AT 6739 MAGNOLIA,

13:23.503 --> 13:25.705
"APARTMENT 2B.

13:25.705 --> 13:28.075
MY PARENTS
ARE OUT OF TOWN."

13:28.075 --> 13:30.810
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE,
THAT'S MY APARTMENT!

13:32.212 --> 13:34.214
WHAT ARE THE NEIGHBORS
GONNA THINK

13:34.214 --> 13:36.716
WHEN SOME CREEPY,
WEIRD DUDE SHOWS UP?

13:36.716 --> 13:40.888
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DID
THEY THINK WHEN YOU MOVED IN?

13:40.888 --> 13:42.555
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS GOING?

13:42.555 --> 13:45.725
UH, WE'RE GONNA PICK UP
AN OVERTIME SHIFT AT THE, UM...

13:45.725 --> 13:47.294
FACTORY.
YEAH.

13:47.294 --> 13:51.431
GEORGE, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHERE ARE YOU REALLY GOING?

13:51.431 --> 13:53.833
OUT, OKAY? OUT.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.969
ERNIE...

13:55.969 --> 13:57.270
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

13:57.270 --> 14:01.541
IF YOU LIE TO ME,
I WILL BE VERY, VERY SAD.

14:01.541 --> 14:05.612
WE'RE GONNA GO BEAT UP
MAX'S ONLINE PERVERT.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.647
OH!
DUDE!

14:07.647 --> 14:11.518
I CAN'T LIE TO HER. I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT ALL THE TIME!

14:11.518 --> 14:15.022
BABY, I ONLY LIE...

14:15.022 --> 14:17.157
TO PROTECT YOU.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.458
DON'T GIVE ME THAT CRAP.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.460
YOU'RE JUST AFRAID
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH

14:20.460 --> 14:22.462
BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN HANDLE IT.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.298
OKAY, WANT TO HANDLE
SOME TRUTH? HERE'S THIS--

14:25.298 --> 14:27.300
YOU KNOW WHY
WE GOT THE HOUSE SO CHEAP?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.102
BECAUSE A HORRIBLE CRIME
WAS COMMITTED HERE.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.603
HERE'S A HINT...

14:30.603 --> 14:32.805
THERE MAY BE SOMETHING
TO THAT FRIGHTENED OLD LADY

14:32.805 --> 14:36.143
WHO RUNS THROUGH YOUR DREAMS.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.178
OH, NO.
WELL, NOW I WANNA MOVE!

14:38.178 --> 14:41.681
ARE YOU KIDDING?
WE'LL NEVER SELL THIS HOUSE.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.483
THERE WAS A BLOODBATH HERE!

14:43.483 --> 14:46.319
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LURED MAX'S STALKER HERE.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.588
I'M GONNA CALL THE POLICE.
THEY WILL HANDLE THIS.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.223
YOU ALREADY TRIED THAT.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.759
THE COPS AREN'T GONNA DO
ANYTHING UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.561
I'M-A SOLVE THIS
THE LOPEZ WAY.

14:54.561 --> 14:58.031
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO ADMIT
THERE'S NO "LOPEZ WAY"?!

14:58.031 --> 14:59.832
THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU SAY

14:59.832 --> 15:02.936
RIGHT BEFORE YOU DO
SOMETHING STUPID OR WRONG.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.372
YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?

15:05.372 --> 15:07.407
NO, BUT I THINK WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT THIS.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.409
YEAH, WHAT'S THAT,
THE "ANGIE WAY"?

15:09.409 --> 15:12.412
TALK, TALK, TALK, UNTIL YOU COME
UP WITH A REASONABLE SOLUTION.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.982
WELL, WE'RE NOT GONNA
DO THAT THIS TIME.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.384
YOU ARE NOT GONNA
WALK OUT THAT DOOR.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.886
YES, I AM. ERNIE AND I
ARE GONNA MAKE SURE

15:19.886 --> 15:22.289
THAT THIS GUY NEVER
MESSES WITH ANY KIDS ANYMORE.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.457
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.893
WHAT IF THIS GUY
STANDS HIS GROUND AND FIGHTS?

15:26.893 --> 15:28.395
WE'RE PREPARED.
RIGHT, ERNIE?

15:28.395 --> 15:30.830
HEY, THAT'S RIGHT.
WATCH OUT, CUP CHECK!

15:30.830 --> 15:31.831
CUP CHECK.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.500
OHH!

15:33.500 --> 15:35.402
DAMN IT!

15:35.402 --> 15:36.903
HEY, MAN,

15:36.903 --> 15:39.439
YOU DON'T SAY "CUP CHECK"
UNLESS YOU'RE WEARING ONE.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.442
I NEVER PLAYED SPORTS,
GEORGE.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.444
I DON'T KNOW!

15:50.650 --> 15:53.586
(exhaling deeply)

15:55.288 --> 15:57.424
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

15:57.424 --> 15:59.959
HEY, I ALWAYS WARM UP
BEFORE I KICK BUTT, EH?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.895
LISTEN, I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THIS GUY, ALL RIGHT?
YA!

16:02.895 --> 16:06.099
YOU JUST STAND BEHIND ME
AND LOOK LIKE MY TOUGH FRIEND.

16:06.099 --> 16:09.436
OH, ALL RIGHT.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.504
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN?
JUST WATCH TV.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.640
OH, OKAY.
(telephone ringing)

16:13.640 --> 16:16.443
HEY, IF THAT'S HIM, DON'T
SAY ANYTHING. JUST BUZZ HIM IN.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.445
YEAH, IT'S EITHER HIM
OR THE PIZZA I ORDERED.

16:18.445 --> 16:19.646
ERNIE!

16:19.646 --> 16:22.315
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW LONG THIS WAS GONNA GO.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.352
DUDE, CAN'T YOU
GO AN HOUR WITHOUT CHEESE?

16:25.352 --> 16:28.188
(Freddie, high-pitched voice)
It's Zoey.

16:35.362 --> 16:39.066
OKAY, THIS IS IT.
NOW I'M-A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.601
WHEN THE GUY OPENS IT,
WE GRAB HIM.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.103
I GOTTA BE HONEST.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.105
I'M AS COMMITTED
TO THIS AS YOU ARE,

16:45.105 --> 16:46.906
BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO ME THAT NOTHING

16:46.906 --> 16:51.411
ABOVE THE NECK OR BELOW
THE WAIST IS IN ANY DANGER.

16:51.411 --> 16:54.114
CHRIS, WE'VE GOT
THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.

16:54.114 --> 16:56.349
THIS GUY'S EXPECTING
A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL,

16:56.349 --> 16:57.684
AND I'VE SEEN YOU FIGHT.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.120
YOU'RE AT LEAST
A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.421
(scoffs)

17:01.421 --> 17:03.856
A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL
WHOSE PILATES INSTRUCTOR

17:03.856 --> 17:07.527
SAYS HE HAS THE STRONGEST CORE
IN THE CLASS.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.508
(high-pitched voice)
IS THAT YOU, ZOEY?

17:21.508 --> 17:23.543
(whispers)
CRACK YOUR VOICE.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.511
IT'S ME...

17:24.511 --> 17:27.114
(deep, throaty voice) MAX.

17:27.114 --> 17:31.418
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS GUY,
WHO DOES HE THINK HE'S KIDDING?

17:31.418 --> 17:35.355
(high-pitched voice)
YES, THIS IS ZOEY.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.490
LET ME IN. I WANNA HUG YOU.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.761
(Ernie) COME ON IN,
THE DOOR'S OPEN.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.696
I WANNA HUG YOU, TOO.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.435
ZOEY?
MAX?

17:48.435 --> 17:50.237
(George and Freddie)
PERVERT!

17:55.842 --> 17:59.512
I'M NOT OLD. I JUST LOOK OLD
TO YOU BECAUSE I'M NOT 14.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.749
YOU--YOU DON'T WANT
ANY OF THIS.

18:05.518 --> 18:06.586
DUDE!

18:06.586 --> 18:10.323
NOT THE TABLE!
THAT'S RENT-TO-OWN!

18:10.323 --> 18:14.194
THIS IS HOT SAUCE.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.196
YOU WANT THIS
IN YOUR FACE?

18:16.196 --> 18:18.498
OH, DUDE, YOU PICKED
THE WRONG GUY, MAN.

18:18.498 --> 18:21.868
I GOT HOT SAUCE ON MY FACE
MOST OF THE TIME ANYWAY.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.740
GIVE IT UP, PERV!
HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE
AFTER MY SON.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.677
OH, YEAH, RIGHT, YOUR "SON."
I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY MAX.

18:30.677 --> 18:33.513
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
"ZOEY."
ZOEY'S MY NIECE.

18:33.513 --> 18:36.516
YEAH? PROVE IT.
I GOT A PICTURE OF HER
IN MY WALLET.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.751
I GOTTA REACH
IN MY POCKET TO GET IT,

18:38.751 --> 18:42.555
UNLESS YOU WANNA DO IT.
OH, YOU'D LIKE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

18:42.555 --> 18:46.125
YOU SEE? THAT'S ME, ZOEY
AND HER MOM ON HER BIRTHDAY.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.560
I MADE THAT CAKE.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.830
ACTUALLY, IT WAS
A CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY TORTE

18:50.830 --> 18:52.632
WITH A ROSE PETAL SORBET.

18:52.632 --> 18:56.068
NOW I'M REALLY
AFRAID OF YOU.

18:56.068 --> 18:59.239
OH, MAN, THAT'S THE GIRL
IN THE PICTURE MAX SHOWED ME.

18:59.239 --> 19:02.175
LET'S SEE SOME PICTURES
OF YOUR KID.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.843
ALL RIGHT.
FAMILY BARBECUE.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.845
THAT'S MY SON MAX,
MY DAUGHTER CARMEN,

19:05.845 --> 19:09.148
AND THAT'S MY WIFE ANGIE.
HELLO.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.684
OH, MAN, SHE'S PRETTY.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.887
IS THAT A GARDEN GNOME
WITH A CIGARETTE IN ITS MOUTH?

19:14.887 --> 19:17.657
NO, MAN, THAT'S MY MOM.

19:17.657 --> 19:21.594
I GUESS THE KIDS REALLY WERE
TALKING TO EACH OTHER ONLINE.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.630
I GUESS
THIS WAS ALL A MISTAKE.

19:23.630 --> 19:27.166
HEY, YOU DODGED
A BULLET TODAY, HOLMES.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.335
I'M SURE.

19:28.335 --> 19:32.772
SO WHAT
DOES "RENT-TO-OWN" MEAN?

19:35.141 --> 19:37.043
SO, UH...

19:37.043 --> 19:38.345
NO HARD FEELINGS?

19:38.345 --> 19:39.812
I'M COOL.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.549
HEY, WHY DON'T WE GRAB
A COUPLE OF BEERS, MAN,

19:42.549 --> 19:44.884
AND JUST FORGET
ALL ABOUT THIS?

19:44.884 --> 19:46.085
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.587
YEAH, I'M IN.

19:47.587 --> 19:50.056
YOU KNOW, I JUST NEED A MINUTE
TO TAKE OUT MY CUP.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.758
ME, TOO.
YEAH, ME, TOO.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.693
ME, TOO.
ME, TOO.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.069
GOOD NEWS.
ZOEY REALLY IS A GIRL.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.571
I MET HER UNCLE,

20:04.571 --> 20:06.506
AND HE INVITED US TO CHICAGO
SO YOU TWO COULD MEET.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.675
NO WAY! THAT'S SO COOL.

20:08.675 --> 20:09.842
WAIT...

20:09.842 --> 20:12.479
ISN'T THIS WHERE
YOU SAY YOU WERE WRONG?

20:12.479 --> 20:14.981
MAX, I WAS LOOKING OUT FOR YOU,
AND I'D DO IT AGAIN

20:14.981 --> 20:17.684
BECAUSE Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
YOU'RE STILL A NAIVE BOY.

20:17.684 --> 20:21.421
I'M 14. I'M ALMOST A MAN.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.490
EVERYONE KNOWS
YOU'RE NOT A MAN

20:23.490 --> 20:26.859
UNTIL YOUR HAND
IS BIGGER THAN YOUR FACE.

20:26.859 --> 20:30.229
DID YOU SPILL SODA
ON YOURSELF? HELLO.
