00:00.734 --> 00:02.201
<i>My name is avery ryan.</i>

00:02.203 --> 00:04.236
<i>I was a victim of cyber crime.</i>

00:04.238 --> 00:07.039
<i>Like you, I posted</i>
<i>on social media,</i>

00:07.041 --> 00:08.607
<i>Checked my bank account</i>
<i>balance online,</i>

00:08.609 --> 00:10.609
<i>Even kept</i>
<i>the confidential files</i>

00:10.611 --> 00:13.045
<i>Of my psychological practice</i>
<i>on my computer.</i>

00:14.614 --> 00:17.549
<i>Then I was hacked,</i>
<i>and as a result,</i>

00:17.551 --> 00:20.119
<i>One of my patients</i>
<i>was murdered.</i>

00:20.121 --> 00:22.588
My investigation into her death
<i>led me to the fbi,</i>

00:22.590 --> 00:25.357
<i>Where I joined a team</i>
<i>of cyber experts</i>

00:25.359 --> 00:28.260
<i>To wage a war against</i>
<i>a new breed of criminal</i>

00:28.262 --> 00:32.164
<i>Hiding on the deep web...</i>

00:32.166 --> 00:35.234
<i>Infiltrating our daily lives</i>
<i>in ways we never imagined...</i>

00:36.736 --> 00:38.737
<i>...Faceless...</i>

00:38.739 --> 00:41.140
<i>Nameless...</i>

00:41.142 --> 00:43.208
<i>Lurking inside our devices,</i>

00:43.210 --> 00:45.411
<i>Just a keystroke away.</i>

00:49.049 --> 00:51.717
(distant siren blaring)

00:51.719 --> 00:53.786
(panting)

00:56.456 --> 00:58.690
(grunts softly)

01:14.841 --> 01:17.576
â™ª

01:42.635 --> 01:44.236
(line ringing)

01:44.238 --> 01:45.737
You've reached raven.
Leave me a message.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.607
Raven, hey, it's me.
It's nelson.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.742
I'm sending you a file,
but just don't open it.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.512
When you get this message, don't
worry about calling me back.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.581
(grunts)

02:09.596 --> 02:11.130
(laughter)

02:11.132 --> 02:13.632
Stop, stop, stop.
Oh, I know.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.634
I will never forget mom's face

02:15.636 --> 02:17.536
When you coughed up
that cricket.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.571
(laughing):
What?!

02:21.241 --> 02:23.909
It was huge. I could feel it
crawling back up my throat.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.454
No.

02:35.456 --> 02:38.290
Don't do it, little brother.
What?

02:38.292 --> 02:41.193
Do not say something mushy
and ruin this.

02:41.195 --> 02:44.663
I love you, francine.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.764
Ew. Ew.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.499
Ugh!
(chuckling)

02:47.501 --> 02:48.834
(phone chimes)

02:48.836 --> 02:51.803
Oh, shoot. I got to go.

02:52.805 --> 02:55.507
Do you mind if I put this
on my credit card

02:55.509 --> 02:56.942
And you just give me cash?

02:56.944 --> 02:59.511
'cause I do not have time
to run to an atm.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.814
Where the heck is my wallet?

03:02.816 --> 03:04.850
I have so much
junk in here.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.486
Seriously, I have
to clean out my bag.

03:13.826 --> 03:15.928
Taylor pettis?

03:16.930 --> 03:19.364
Oh, my god,
that's him, isn't it?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.600
Wait, daniel. Wait. What are
you...? Why are you going?

03:21.602 --> 03:24.203
I want to talk to him.
What? No. Why?
Just, let's just go.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.371
He killed our parents,
and I want to talk to him.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.440
Daniel, no. Please?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.615
I can't believe
they let you out.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.584
I was hoping for
the death penalty.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.586
Did you know that?
Excuse me.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.988
Can I get a
to-go container?
You don't
want to chat?

03:45.325 --> 03:46.858
What do you want from me?

03:46.860 --> 03:48.627
I came over
here to give you

03:48.629 --> 03:50.596
A little piece of advice.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.364
Don't do anything wrong.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.966
For 17 years,
I was afraid of you,

03:53.968 --> 03:56.635
Even when you were locked away,
but you know what?

03:56.637 --> 03:58.637
Now I'm an fbi agent,
and you are just

03:58.639 --> 04:00.606
A scumbag criminal.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.641
You know what that means?

04:02.643 --> 04:05.410
I'm your worst nightmare.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.346
You do anything illegal,

04:07.348 --> 04:11.383
And I will bust your ass
back to prison for life!

04:11.385 --> 04:14.720
You can hide, lay low,
move away, and I will still

04:14.722 --> 04:17.522
Come after you.

04:18.758 --> 04:22.728
(sighs)

04:22.730 --> 04:24.730
Ryan:
<i>Listen up, we got a new case.</i>

04:24.732 --> 04:27.666
<i>Tabloid gossip amplified.</i>

04:27.668 --> 04:29.368
Each one of these people woke up

04:29.370 --> 04:30.836
This morning
the victim of a hack.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.904
Recordings
of personal conversations

04:32.906 --> 04:34.606
They had were leaked online.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.675
All right, I got a congressman,
a ceo, an accountant.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.643
Krumitz:
And a grocery store clerk?

04:37.645 --> 04:39.378
Mundo:
It doesn't add up.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.413
There's no apparent connection
between any of these victims.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.682
Well, this is a specific
and unusual hack.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.916
No e-mails, no
personal photos.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.918
Just audio files.
And none
of the victims'

04:46.920 --> 04:50.355
Devices collected revealed
any evidence of an intrusion.

04:50.357 --> 04:51.790
Krumitz, I want you to run

04:51.792 --> 04:54.293
A waveform analysis
on those audio files.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.861
Where, when,
how were they recorded?

04:55.863 --> 04:58.297
There's got to be a connection.
Nelson?

04:59.299 --> 05:00.799
Where's nelson?

05:02.535 --> 05:05.637
Sorry. I... I thought
I mentioned this. Nelson called.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.939
He fell asleep on the metro
and missed his stop,

05:07.941 --> 05:09.808
So he should be here...
Any minute now?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.510
Daniel, I'll help you
with the audio files.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.945
Ryan:
Our target
has an agenda.

05:13.947 --> 05:17.049
We need to know what that is
so we can find them.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.694
Woman:
It's easy to steal from them.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.662
It started with me
taking a few dollars

05:30.664 --> 05:32.364
From the register every shift.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.333
Man:
I sometimes imagine killing him.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.401
I'm afraid
I'll really do it someday.

05:36.403 --> 05:39.538
Man 2:
I feel so guilty every time
I look into my wife's eyes

05:39.540 --> 05:40.939
And tell her I was working late

05:40.941 --> 05:42.874
When really
I was with another woman.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.010
Woman 2: He was 15.
I was his math teacher.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.945
I never intended
to have sex with him.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.780
It just happened.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.549
Sounds like a confession.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.783
Bring down the volume
on the main track

05:51.785 --> 05:53.085
And pull up the room tone.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.690
(water flowing)

05:58.692 --> 06:00.559
Is that the sound of water?
Krumitz:
Yep.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.794
It's the only sound all
the audio files have in common.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.097
So, they were all recorded
in the same place.

06:06.599 --> 06:08.767
There's hesitation,
moments of defensiveness,

06:08.769 --> 06:10.802
And ultimately, relief.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.104
These aren't confessions.

06:12.106 --> 06:13.505
They're sessions.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.140
They're therapy sessions.

06:15.142 --> 06:18.076
Our victims' confidential files
were hacked.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.811
And they all have
the same therapist.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.114
I'm gonna make a call,
get an address.

06:22.116 --> 06:23.548
Elijah, krumitz, you're with me.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.450
Let's go.

06:25.452 --> 06:28.453
Uh, I don't know
what nelson's up to

06:28.455 --> 06:29.755
Or what you know
about where he is,

06:29.757 --> 06:31.757
But I think it would
be a very good idea

06:31.759 --> 06:33.525
If he were here
when we got back.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.627
Me, too.
Yeah.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.798
(sighs heavily)

06:39.800 --> 06:41.733
You've reached brody nelson.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.968
Leave me a message.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.504
Nelson, it's me <i>again.</i>

06:45.506 --> 06:47.072
I'm officially worried.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.141
Call me.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.846
Screw it.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.922
There you are, nelson.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.825
<i>Agent ryan, those nine victims</i>
<i>were all patients</i>

07:06.827 --> 07:08.527
<i>Of a dr. Richard chan.</i>

07:08.529 --> 07:10.462
<i>350 mass avenue northeast.</i>

07:10.464 --> 07:11.863
Ryan:
<i>Thank you.</i>

07:11.865 --> 07:13.932
The door's ajar.

07:26.879 --> 07:29.047
Ryan:
There's our sound of water.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.715
There was a struggle.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.984
(camera shutter clicking)

07:59.612 --> 08:00.812
Ramirez:
Nelson!

08:00.814 --> 08:02.047
I'm over here!

08:02.049 --> 08:04.015
Come on!

08:04.017 --> 08:05.851
Cut me loose. I'm tied up.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.553
Come on!

08:08.555 --> 08:10.055
What happened?

08:10.057 --> 08:11.590
Are you okay?

08:11.592 --> 08:13.859
Did you get the file I sent?
Yes, I got the file.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.660
What are you up to, nelson?

08:15.662 --> 08:17.629
Did you get in
a fight or something?

08:17.631 --> 08:19.865
(panting)

08:21.000 --> 08:23.835
It's gone!
Everything is... Is gone.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.171
What are you talking about?!

08:26.173 --> 08:29.007
You sure you got
the file I sent?
Yes, I have
the file you sent me.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.243
I have it
right here.
Okay, good.

08:31.245 --> 08:33.912
But, nelson, there is fbi
protocol that we need to follow.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.180
They take this stuff seriously.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.716
If this isn't for a case,

08:37.718 --> 08:39.718
You could go to jail,
and I could, too,

08:39.720 --> 08:41.086
Because you've made
me an accomplice.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.521
All right.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.056
So, I'm gonna ask you
again, what is going on?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.791
Look, I can't tell you,
all right?

08:46.793 --> 08:48.827
I have to speak to avery.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.630
Unbelievable.

08:55.968 --> 08:57.769
It was a match.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.070
The print lifted
from that hourglass

08:59.072 --> 09:00.872
We collected at
dr. Chan's office.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.174
Did you get a name in afis?

09:03.176 --> 09:06.912
Actually, was an fbi database,
a reference print.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.047
It was mine.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.148
You don't seem surprised.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.317
That hourglass
caught my eye.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.720
I had the same one on my desk
when I was a psychologist--

09:15.722 --> 09:16.988
Until it went missing.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.189
Avery, that was a long time ago.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.025
You don't think
it was the same one?

09:20.027 --> 09:21.026
But you can't argue
with evidence.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.161
My print was on that glass,

09:23.163 --> 09:24.796
Even though
I didn't touch anything

09:24.798 --> 09:26.298
At the crime scene,
so either

09:26.300 --> 09:27.966
It's the same one,
or someone went

09:27.968 --> 09:30.001
To a lot of trouble
to plant my print.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.903
Sifter:
I get the feeling
you know something

09:31.905 --> 09:33.905
More than
what you're telling us.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.740
I don't know what I know, simon.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.109
Avery, four more recordings
were released online.

09:38.111 --> 09:41.179
Someone's also leaked
the details of dr. Chan's

09:41.181 --> 09:42.581
Murder investigation.

09:42.583 --> 09:46.651
Your personal involvement could
compromise this investigation.

09:46.653 --> 09:50.255
So, at the very least, tell
me what you think you know.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.324
Avery, I need to talk to you.

09:52.326 --> 09:53.825
Nelson, you're hurt.

09:53.827 --> 09:54.993
What's happened?
I'm fine.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.161
It's-it's not important.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.096
Can we talk? Alone?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.931
Excuse me.
All right.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.102
Where have you been?
What is going on?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.670
I need your cell phone.

10:05.672 --> 10:06.871
Why?

10:06.873 --> 10:08.106
It's important.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.011
Is your personal
laptop here?

10:13.013 --> 10:15.780
No, I left it at home. Why?

10:15.782 --> 10:17.749
Someone is spying on you.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.050
How do you know that?

10:19.052 --> 10:22.087
Because <i>I</i> was spying on you.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.055
My first week here,

10:24.057 --> 10:27.292
That your psychology practice
was hacked,

10:27.294 --> 10:29.294
And how you hadn't
found the guy.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.062
Well, it stuck with me.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.164
I was a behavioral
psychologist.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.700
I had a practice in new york.

10:35.702 --> 10:38.970
And then, one day, all my
patients' files were stolen

10:38.972 --> 10:41.139
From my computer,

10:41.141 --> 10:44.075
And all their
secrets went public.

10:44.077 --> 10:47.278
I was trying to solve
the unsolvable case.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.880
I saw it as a challenge,

10:48.882 --> 10:50.982
So I went digging
on the deep web.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.283
Nelson,

10:52.285 --> 10:54.285
You broke the conditions
of your parole.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.021
Look, I know. I figured

10:56.023 --> 10:58.356
Whoever hacked you had to keep
the files he stole somewhere.

10:58.358 --> 11:01.793
Just not on a personal device,
but the safest place.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.829
Are you telling me...

11:04.831 --> 11:06.898
You found my files?

11:06.900 --> 11:09.167
Yes.
But the hacker

11:09.169 --> 11:11.369
Has new information about you.
Current documents, photos.

11:11.371 --> 11:14.105
Even has recordings
of your phone conversations.

11:14.107 --> 11:17.909
The fbi runs vulnerability
testing quarterly.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.744
Last month,
they scanned all my devices.

11:19.746 --> 11:21.079
They're clean.
I know.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.314
Which is why I didn't come
to you right away.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.016
I wanted to confirm it.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.351
And I did.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.919
Last night.

11:27.921 --> 11:32.757
<i>On your home laptop attached</i>
<i>to a personal video file.</i>

11:38.864 --> 11:41.066
<i>I downloaded</i>
<i>the malicious code.</i>

11:41.701 --> 11:42.701
I have it right here.

11:42.703 --> 11:43.802
Come on.

11:45.838 --> 11:47.839
Ah, perfect timing.

11:47.841 --> 11:51.176
I just I.D.'d the remote access
trojan on dr. Chan's computer.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.278
Complete control
of the device.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.946
He had access to
the doctor's files

11:54.948 --> 11:56.181
And could
remotely turn

11:56.183 --> 11:57.816
The computer's
microphone on and off.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.117
I couldn't identify
the rat at the scene

11:59.119 --> 12:00.418
Because it was
an unknown exploit.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.088
My guess is it was created
by an old-school hacker.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.223
Even today, it's pretty
impressive work.

12:05.225 --> 12:09.127
This is it.
Dude, what happened to you?
Why are you bleeding?

12:09.129 --> 12:11.863
And where the hell did you find
that code? That's it.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.032
That's the code I just found
on chan's computer.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.267
That's how our target
was able

12:16.269 --> 12:17.936
<i>To open up the microphone</i>
<i>on dr. Chan's</i>

12:17.938 --> 12:19.738
<i>Computer and listen in.</i>

12:19.740 --> 12:21.072
Woman:
<i>My husband will divorce me.</i>

12:21.074 --> 12:22.507
Man:
<i>I sometimes imagine</i>
<i>killing him.</i>

12:22.509 --> 12:26.077
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>I'll really do it someday.</i>

12:26.079 --> 12:28.213
Krumitz:
<i>Then our target</i>
<i>must have recorded the sessions</i>

12:28.215 --> 12:29.848
<i>On his own device.</i>

12:29.850 --> 12:31.916
Nelson just discovered it
on my laptop.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.918
Wait, what?
Yeah, it's been there
for a while.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.187
It means whoever hacked
dr. Chan is the same black hat

12:36.189 --> 12:37.288
Who hacked me

12:37.290 --> 12:39.090
All those
years ago.

12:40.226 --> 12:42.427
He's back.

12:45.965 --> 12:52.170
â™ª I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise â™ª

12:54.039 --> 12:59.811
â™ª I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes â™ª

12:59.813 --> 13:04.048
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

13:04.050 --> 13:07.185
â™ª I can see for miles
and miles â™ª

13:07.187 --> 13:11.956
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

13:11.958 --> 13:15.226
â™ª and miles...

13:15.228 --> 13:17.796
â™ª oh, yeah.

13:31.043 --> 13:35.046
Ryan:
<i>All my patients' files</i>
<i>were stolen from my computer</i>

13:35.048 --> 13:37.448
<i>And all their secrets</i>
<i>made public.</i>

13:37.450 --> 13:39.450
Nelson:
<i>So did you catch him?</i>
<i>The hacker?</i>

13:39.452 --> 13:41.452
Ryan:
<i>Still don't even know</i>
<i>who he is.</i>

13:41.454 --> 13:44.556
Our target's trying
to get my attention.

13:44.558 --> 13:47.826
Wait, exposing secrets
and embarrassing people is a way

13:47.828 --> 13:51.196
You have no personal connection
to any of the victims.

13:53.265 --> 13:54.899
You have a personal connection
to the target.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.434
It's a reminder of...

13:56.436 --> 13:59.037
New york when he stole
all my patient files.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.038
So why now?

14:00.040 --> 14:01.439
Why not three months from now?

14:01.441 --> 14:03.575
Because nelson
stirred the monster.

14:03.577 --> 14:06.110
And he thought nelson was you.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.513
He thought you'd discovered him,
and he got scared.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.181
Yeah, but it didn't scare him.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.851
It thrilled him.
This is part of his endgame.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.854
Nelson didn't just find
my old patient files.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.456
He discovered I'm being watched

14:18.458 --> 14:22.193
And I have been since the day
my practice was hacked.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.895
What?

14:23.897 --> 14:26.965
I was always my hacker's
intended victim.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.869
So your fingerprint
on that hourglass

14:30.871 --> 14:33.538
At dr. Chan's murder scene,
that was his message,

14:33.540 --> 14:36.207
His way of guaranteeing
you'd be involved.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.210
Our target has been lying
in wait

14:39.212 --> 14:42.013
Preparing for this day.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.452
All right. That's
every computer I owned

14:47.454 --> 14:49.420
Since I was first hacked.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.089
So this is your place, huh?

14:51.091 --> 14:53.892
Nice. Homey.

14:53.894 --> 14:56.027
Well, what did you expect?

14:56.029 --> 14:57.629
Oh, I don't know.

14:57.631 --> 15:00.498
A drum set, velvet elvis,

15:00.500 --> 15:02.066
Pet alligator.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.534
Well, he's at the vet.

15:05.638 --> 15:09.908
Any-who, um,
I brought you a present.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.511
Couldn't leave you
without a computer or a phone,

15:13.513 --> 15:15.179
So...

15:16.348 --> 15:18.216
Fbi laptop. Clean as a whistle.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.585
Connected to
our network.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.554
And... Burner cell.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.423
With all your contacts
already uploaded.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.125
Thanks, krummy.

15:32.064 --> 15:34.165
If you want, I could stay.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.101
Aw.
I have a new
binary code app.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.437
Anyway, um,
so your-your security detail

15:39.439 --> 15:41.406
Is, uh, parked outside

15:41.408 --> 15:44.609
And, uh, I will see you
in the morning, boss.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.244
(chuckles)

15:46.246 --> 15:48.313
(chuckling):
Oh. Thank you, daniel.

15:58.557 --> 16:00.358
So...

16:00.360 --> 16:04.595
<i>She transferred the video file</i>
<i>with the embedded rat.</i>

16:07.299 --> 16:09.500
With every transfer, she was
basically rat'ing herself.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.303
Ramirez:
When she clicked on the infected
video file on her new computer,

16:12.305 --> 16:13.972
The hacker had complete control.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.606
So to find the hacker,

16:15.608 --> 16:17.275
We need to find
the legacy device.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.111
The very first computer the
hacker infected with the rat.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.579
The one he
actually touched.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.648
The only one that can
lead us to him.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.283
Our digital patient zero.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.085
Sounds great, but it's not here.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.554
But we do have
dr. Chan's laptop.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.689
Which was infected directly
by the hacker.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.558
That's where we'll start.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.626
Aw, you're so smart.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.695
(scoffs)
don't even try it.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.365
What?
I'm still mad
at you.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.367
Sifter. What?

16:42.369 --> 16:45.436
What about daniel krumitz?

16:46.705 --> 16:48.706
Is everything okay?

16:48.708 --> 16:51.509
No, it is not.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.379
Taylor pettis filed a report
with metro pd.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.047
Claims you threatened him.

16:57.549 --> 17:00.151
(sighs) you know, daniel,
this is serious.

17:00.153 --> 17:03.588
Your badge doesn't give you
authority to break the law.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.056
I didn't break the law.

17:05.058 --> 17:08.793
And unless you're gonna suspend
me or assign me to desk duty

17:08.795 --> 17:11.496
And put me on probation, I don't
really want to talk about it.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.563
Hey. Sit down.

17:14.466 --> 17:16.567
We're not done yet.

17:17.636 --> 17:19.637
My friend,
you are trapped in ice.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.407
When a traumatic event happens
to us at a certain age,

17:22.409 --> 17:26.411
We tend to always relate to it
like we're still that same age.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.413
Okay, so I'll just grow up.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.749
You see, right there, that was
the frustrated, scared response

17:31.751 --> 17:33.818
Of a ten-year-old.

17:38.223 --> 17:42.393
I watched my best friend
burn to death.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.829
In college, we were
driving back to campus

17:44.831 --> 17:47.398
After thanksgiving break.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.134
A truck driver fell asleep
at the wheel,

17:50.136 --> 17:51.302
Slammed right into us.

17:51.304 --> 17:54.539
Brian whispered his last words
into my ear.

17:56.308 --> 17:59.544
Since then,
every whisper I hear,

17:59.546 --> 18:01.112
Somebody
leans forward

18:01.114 --> 18:03.114
To share a
confidence with me,

18:03.116 --> 18:05.483
I don't even hear the words.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.518
Just his whisper.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.854
"don't let me die."

18:10.823 --> 18:13.691
You're never gonna get rid
of the loss,

18:13.693 --> 18:16.727
But you have got to get past
this anger. Because that...

18:16.729 --> 18:19.530
Ten-year-old kid
who lost his parents

18:19.532 --> 18:23.468
Is now a 28-year-old man.

18:38.717 --> 18:40.818
(sighs)

18:56.535 --> 18:59.537
(alarm beeping)

19:01.306 --> 19:04.575
Krumitz, what's going on?

19:04.577 --> 19:06.644
I don't know. It's happening
in tear down, too.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.212
Excuse me.

19:08.214 --> 19:10.515
One of our computers was
infected with a malicious code.

19:11.617 --> 19:12.617
Cyber's been hacked?

19:12.619 --> 19:14.185
Looks like the same rat

19:14.187 --> 19:15.887
We found on dr. Chan
and avery's computers.

19:18.223 --> 19:20.591
Ryan:
All right,
you want to play games?

19:21.693 --> 19:23.895
Let's play.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.333
(crying softly)

19:40.412 --> 19:41.679
Mundo:
How did this happen?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.281
Did we infect ourselves?
Krumitz: No.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.249
It looks
like avery infected herself.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.517
I thought
you took all her devices.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.186
I gave her an fbi laptop.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.921
But she needed the video file
on the flash drive.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.457
Wait a minute.
It's gone.

19:53.459 --> 19:54.559
What?

19:54.561 --> 19:56.627
The flash drive.
I-I put it right here.

19:56.629 --> 19:57.562
She doesn't want us to know
what she's doing.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.371
I know you hacked my computer.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.274
I know you're watching me.

20:10.276 --> 20:12.677
You have my attention.
What do you want now?

20:33.799 --> 20:35.700
(alarm continues beeping)

20:35.702 --> 20:37.235
(groans)

20:37.237 --> 20:39.604
(vibrating)

20:40.572 --> 20:43.975
Come on. Pick up, pick up.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.451
Man (over speaker):
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.787
The 5:30 departure for richmond
is now boarding.

21:13.705 --> 21:15.773
(beeping)

21:28.720 --> 21:30.688
(phone chiming)

21:34.593 --> 21:37.361
It's glued down. Smart.

22:00.952 --> 22:02.453
(phone chimes)

22:12.597 --> 22:14.398
Mundo: <i>Krumitz worked through</i>
<i>the night eradicating the virus</i>

22:14.400 --> 22:16.033
<i>From ctoc.</i>
<i>Sifter:</i> <i>That's great, but</i>

22:16.035 --> 22:18.035
Our target's just
released information

22:18.037 --> 22:20.338
On three more
of dr. Chan's patients.

22:20.340 --> 22:21.839
Any word from avery?
No.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.774
And we can't track her.
Avery's gone dark.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.476
What do you think?

22:25.478 --> 22:26.777
I think this is personal.

22:26.779 --> 22:27.978
I think avery went after
her hacker.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.847
We got something
off of dr. Chan's laptop.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.717
The hacker was clever.
He was hopping his I.P. Address.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.518
We finally found the network
the rat was using

22:34.520 --> 22:37.822
We also got a physical
address on him as well.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.790
We know exactly
where our hacker is.

22:51.002 --> 22:52.770
Don't shoot,
don't shoot,

22:52.772 --> 22:54.572
Don't shoot,
don't shoot.
Hands up. On the floor.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.507
On the floor now.
Okay. I'm down,
I'm down.

22:56.509 --> 22:57.942
Clear.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.543
(grunts)

22:59.545 --> 23:00.678
What is this about?

23:00.680 --> 23:03.748
Swat officer:
Clear.
Ow.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.883
What is this about?

23:06.752 --> 23:08.786
Where's avery?
Avery?

23:08.788 --> 23:10.488
Where is she?!
Avery ryan?

23:10.490 --> 23:12.823
Wh... Aah!

23:12.825 --> 23:13.958
Your code was old-school,
andrew.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.826
It was tough to break,
but we got you.

23:15.828 --> 23:16.927
So one more time.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.529
Aah!
Where is she?

23:18.531 --> 23:20.631
I don't know what's happened,
but I swear to you

23:20.633 --> 23:22.533
I haven't seen
my ex-wife in years.

23:24.002 --> 23:25.636
What'd you say?

23:27.639 --> 23:30.775
I last saw avery
four years ago in new york.

23:30.777 --> 23:33.511
I haven't seen
my ex-wife since then.

23:46.691 --> 23:48.759
(clang, whoosh)

24:14.653 --> 24:16.554
Not bad.

24:16.556 --> 24:19.924
You worked hard
to set all this up.

24:19.926 --> 24:22.059
I'm almost impressed.

24:29.067 --> 24:31.669
Well, you have
a pretty impressive

24:31.671 --> 24:33.737
Eye for detail.

24:35.941 --> 24:37.975
You were one of my patients.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.911
(laughs)
oh.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.814
You stole this.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.616
Mmm.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.152
And my hourglass

24:48.154 --> 24:50.087
And my patient files.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.490
You ruined my practice.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.758
My only question is why.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.828
You went to all this trouble

24:57.830 --> 25:00.130
To re-create my office

25:00.132 --> 25:03.834
To get me to come here,
so where are you?

25:03.836 --> 25:05.803
Man:
You failed.

25:05.805 --> 25:08.105
You failed all your patients.

25:19.885 --> 25:21.752
You knew avery was married,

25:21.754 --> 25:23.187
And you never
said anything?

25:23.189 --> 25:25.956
I don't share
avery's background with anyone.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.192
Or yours, for that matter.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.528
Will somebody
please tell me

25:30.530 --> 25:31.929
What's going on here?

25:31.931 --> 25:34.098
We are trying
to find avery, sir.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.966
That's why your people
are searching my house

25:35.968 --> 25:37.868
And snooping
through my computer?
All we know

25:37.870 --> 25:40.004
Is that somebody's computer
got hacked in just the same way

25:40.006 --> 25:42.640
That your ex-wife's
got hacked ten years ago.

25:42.642 --> 25:44.909
And our investigation, sir,

25:44.911 --> 25:46.944
Has led us right to you.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.546
Well, let me
assure you that

25:48.548 --> 25:50.881
I would never do anything
to hurt avery.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.216
Mundo:
Divorce is tough.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.784
I've been there.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.085
Resentment builds.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.253
Anger.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.888
Sounds like
you have a lot of issues.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.890
None of which I can relate to.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.959
What came between avery and I...

26:04.863 --> 26:06.864
Do I need a lawyer?

26:06.866 --> 26:08.999
Tell me, how did I fail you?

26:09.001 --> 26:12.136
You were quite fond
of your other patients.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.737
My other patients.

26:13.739 --> 26:14.738
But not you?

26:14.740 --> 26:16.340
No. We were close.

26:16.342 --> 26:19.176
Close. You felt
we had something more.

26:19.178 --> 26:21.579
We had something special.

26:21.581 --> 26:24.615
Well, something must have
happened in our relationship.

26:25.717 --> 26:28.619
You hacked my computer
and stole my files.

26:28.621 --> 26:30.921
Demonstrating
how powerful you were.

26:30.923 --> 26:34.191
How powerful I am.

26:34.193 --> 26:37.194
(chuckles) of course.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.829
Well, if you brought me here

26:38.831 --> 26:40.898
For a session,
maybe we should start

26:40.900 --> 26:44.201
With your delusional fantasies
and your obsessive behavior.

26:44.203 --> 26:48.973
Dr. Ryan, you've been after me
for a very long time.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.674
It keeps you up at night.

26:50.676 --> 26:52.676
You came here today
looking for answers,

26:52.678 --> 26:55.079
Despite the possible danger.

26:55.081 --> 26:57.982
So you tell me,
who's delusional and obsessive?

27:03.321 --> 27:04.822
His computer's squeaky clean.

27:04.824 --> 27:06.624
He didn't hack
dr. Chan or avery.

27:06.626 --> 27:07.958
All right, well, someone's
working awfully hard

27:07.960 --> 27:09.226
To put hubby in
our crosshairs.

27:09.228 --> 27:10.961
Sifter:
I know it was
a while ago,

27:10.963 --> 27:12.963
But is there anything
in particular you recall

27:12.965 --> 27:14.965
About that time that
avery's files were hacked?

27:14.967 --> 27:17.368
Well, we were divorced by then.

27:17.370 --> 27:19.003
Next time we spoke,
she dropped by here,

27:19.005 --> 27:20.838
Told me she was
moving to d.C.,

27:20.840 --> 27:24.041
Asked me to hold on
to some of her old office stuff

27:24.043 --> 27:26.243
Until she sent for it.
Which she never did.

27:26.245 --> 27:27.978
Office stuff?

27:27.980 --> 27:29.113
Yeah, books, pictures,

27:29.115 --> 27:32.149
Files, an old
computer-- stuff.

27:34.953 --> 27:37.221
I was hoping we'd be able
to speak in person.

27:37.223 --> 27:39.857
I prefer to speak this way.

27:39.859 --> 27:43.761
There are 77 files
on the screen,

27:43.763 --> 27:47.131
Displaying each patient's
last name.

27:47.133 --> 27:51.135
I had 78 patients.

27:51.137 --> 27:54.138
You're conspicuous
by your absence.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.306
I should've known it was you

27:56.308 --> 27:59.209
When I walked into an abandoned
steel factory.

27:59.211 --> 28:01.812
Your abusive father
was a steelworker.

28:01.814 --> 28:04.014
You told me what he did to you.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.115
It's because of him

28:05.117 --> 28:08.185
You have such severe
social anxiety.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.857
It's what keeps you
on that side of the screen...

28:13.859 --> 28:17.027
Logan.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.063
Logan reeves.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.966
(door squeaks open)

28:51.730 --> 28:54.798
Why don't you have a seat,
logan, so we can get started?

28:54.800 --> 28:56.400
I'll stand.

28:56.402 --> 29:00.070
Whatever makes you
most comfortable.

29:04.342 --> 29:06.944
Let's talk about
how you're feeling.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.445
Clearly you're still
angry with your father,

29:08.447 --> 29:11.949
Which is why you chose
this place for our session.

29:11.951 --> 29:14.451
This is not about him.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.453
What is it about, then?

29:16.455 --> 29:18.388
You promised me that
you'd always be there.

29:18.390 --> 29:19.890
That you'd help.

29:19.892 --> 29:23.127
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that I failed you.

29:23.129 --> 29:26.497
You need to understand
I could no longer help you.

29:26.499 --> 29:28.132
You abandoned me.

29:28.134 --> 29:30.501
You pushed me off
onto another doctor

29:30.503 --> 29:33.203
Who forced me
into taking medications

29:33.205 --> 29:35.305
That only made things worse.
Logan,

29:35.307 --> 29:38.342
You suffer
from a delusional disorder.

29:38.344 --> 29:42.813
You needed further treatment
which I could not provide.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.982
That's not true.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.950
I read your notes.

29:48.086 --> 29:51.488
(scoffs) "patient
responding to treatment."

29:51.490 --> 29:53.490
Responding.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.092
I was improving.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.927
That was before I understood

29:56.929 --> 29:59.863
Your attachment to me
was hindering your progress.

30:01.166 --> 30:04.434
You were the only person
that could ever help me.

30:04.436 --> 30:07.137
Well, I'm here now.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.840
Let's talk.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.453
Here's the laptop avery's
ex-husband gave us.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.923
The legacy device.
The rat's been
on this computer for years.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.291
Avery had no way of knowing.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.827
But the hacker had to leave
digital fingerprints.

30:29.829 --> 30:32.863
Krummy, pull up the event log
with all the connected devices.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.464
That computer connected
to a couple dozen

30:34.466 --> 30:36.133
External devices
throughout its life.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.135
Krumitz:
Yeah, we're looking
for the outlier.

30:38.137 --> 30:40.237
Uh...
Nelson: There.

30:40.239 --> 30:42.573
The devices on this list
have connected multiple times,

30:42.575 --> 30:45.542
Ramirez:
Only plugged in once.
Nelson: That's our rat.

30:45.544 --> 30:48.178
It's got to be.
How did
the hacker

30:48.180 --> 30:50.047
Gain access to avery's
laptop in the first place?

30:50.049 --> 30:54.885
The transfer occurred
on a Wednesday at 2:34 p.M.

30:54.887 --> 30:56.854
Business hours.
A patient.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.222
Okay, we've got
avery's old

30:58.224 --> 31:00.390
Address book on here.
On that date and time...

31:00.392 --> 31:01.925
Uh, she was in a session.

31:01.927 --> 31:05.596
"patient exhibits paranoid
and delusional tendencies.

31:05.598 --> 31:07.931
"anxiety. Anger.

31:07.933 --> 31:10.467
"potential early onset
psychotic disorder.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.636
Not a danger to himself
or others at this time."

31:12.638 --> 31:16.073
That's reassuring.
Not so fast.

31:16.075 --> 31:17.941
According to
the fbi database,

31:17.943 --> 31:19.576
Over the last decade,
logan reeves

31:19.578 --> 31:20.978
Has been arrested
multiple times.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.981
All violent
charges.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.582
Avery:
<i>Tell me about when you first</i>

31:25.584 --> 31:29.019
As I recall, you didn't
even like computers.

31:29.021 --> 31:31.922
Mmm. (softly laughs)

31:31.924 --> 31:33.490
I liked you.

31:35.627 --> 31:38.295
I became a proficient hacker
to get to know you better.

31:38.297 --> 31:41.632
I... Felt like you knew
everything about me.

31:41.634 --> 31:43.500
I knew nothing about you.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.669
It was a very
one-sided relationship.

31:45.671 --> 31:49.673
Mmm. Well, that's
what therapy is.

31:49.675 --> 31:52.910
I was your doctor,
not your friend.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.645
For someone who claims
to be so perceptive,

31:54.647 --> 31:57.648
You clearly don't understand
what this is all about.

31:57.650 --> 31:58.115
Then tell me.

32:02.654 --> 32:05.355
It's not about
you fixing me, okay?

32:07.025 --> 32:08.458
See, you...

32:08.460 --> 32:12.095
Had your chance to help me.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.364
But you gave up!

32:14.366 --> 32:17.000
You gave up on me!

32:25.443 --> 32:27.711
We need a lock on this guy asap.

32:27.713 --> 32:30.013
Last knowns. Current aliases.

32:30.015 --> 32:34.051
I want to know everything
there is about logan reeves.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.086
I got logan's
last known address.

32:36.088 --> 32:38.588
Saratoga springs.
Mental institution.

32:38.590 --> 32:41.024
Unfortunately, it closed down
a little over a year ago.

32:41.026 --> 32:44.661
Back out on the street.
No follow-ups. No clue.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.163
You've got to be kidding me.

32:46.165 --> 32:49.266
There has to be something
else we can do.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.134
Avery, where are you?

32:51.136 --> 32:54.204
(heavy door sliding open)

33:01.446 --> 33:03.447
Danielle.

33:03.449 --> 33:04.748
You remember her?

33:04.750 --> 33:07.184
My former patient?

33:07.186 --> 33:09.553
Mm-hmm, the one
that you didn't give up on.

33:09.555 --> 33:12.055
The one that you devoted
so much time to.

33:12.057 --> 33:14.057
The one that
you chose to help

33:14.059 --> 33:15.759
When you didn't
want to help me.

33:15.761 --> 33:18.662
For that reason,
she had to die.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.764
Oh, you were so convinced

33:20.766 --> 33:22.299
That her abusive
ex-husband killed her,

33:22.301 --> 33:24.601
You even testified
against him.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.103
You helped convict
an innocent man,

33:26.105 --> 33:28.505
And now he is
rotting in jail.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.507
You killed danielle.

33:30.509 --> 33:33.343
It's so much harder
than you would think

33:33.345 --> 33:36.046
To strangle a person.

33:38.149 --> 33:42.319
People find strength
when they're facing death, hmm?

33:44.789 --> 33:46.390
But dr. Chan--

33:46.392 --> 33:48.558
Ooh.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.660
He put up much more of a fight

33:50.662 --> 33:53.230
Than your little friend,
danielle.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.732
What? No response?

33:55.734 --> 33:57.768
(laughs)

33:57.770 --> 34:01.772
You act like
you are so... Emotionless,

34:01.774 --> 34:03.774
But I know the truth.

34:03.776 --> 34:05.809
Yeah, yeah, I knew

34:05.811 --> 34:08.278
That you would transfer
that video

34:08.280 --> 34:11.782
To all of your devices
because of its

34:11.784 --> 34:14.051
Sentimental value.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.787
Your emotions are the reason

34:16.789 --> 34:20.290
That I've been able
to watch you all these years.

34:20.292 --> 34:22.793
Do you understand
what you've done, logan?

34:22.795 --> 34:25.062
(panting)

34:25.797 --> 34:28.432
Do you? Hmm?

34:28.434 --> 34:30.634
Hmm?

34:30.636 --> 34:35.806
I did this for
you, for us.

34:35.808 --> 34:37.774
(ryan coughs)
this is where we began,

34:37.776 --> 34:39.776
And this is where
we're going to end.

34:43.681 --> 34:45.849
(inhales loudly
through his nose)

34:45.851 --> 34:47.417
(exhales though mouth)

34:47.419 --> 34:49.453
It's carbon monoxide poisoning.

34:51.522 --> 34:53.657
(laughing): I bet that
you thought that you

34:53.659 --> 34:55.826
Have to be in, like, oh,
a small, enclosed space,

34:55.828 --> 34:59.229
Like a... A car, right,
for it to kill you.

34:59.231 --> 35:00.831
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

35:00.833 --> 35:05.135
No, it just takes a little bit
in the air, and you're dead.

35:05.137 --> 35:07.137
You think,
because you outweigh me,

35:07.139 --> 35:09.406
It ensures
that I'll die before you?

35:11.142 --> 35:13.210
But what if I don't?

35:21.819 --> 35:24.254
(grunting)

35:32.130 --> 35:34.631
(coughing)

35:41.205 --> 35:43.273
(phone ringing)

35:44.842 --> 35:47.177
This is elijah mundo.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.346
Ryan (exhales):
It's me.

35:49.348 --> 35:51.381
It's avery.

35:51.383 --> 35:54.284
Four eight two six...

35:54.286 --> 35:55.919
Riverside drive.

35:55.921 --> 35:59.156
It's carbon...

36:00.191 --> 36:01.658
A-avery?

36:01.660 --> 36:03.727
Avery?

36:14.238 --> 36:15.939
It's got a keypad entry.

36:15.941 --> 36:18.208
Elijah, elijah, we got this.

36:32.256 --> 36:33.690
Got it?
One more second.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.292
We're good.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.495
Okay, we're in.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.730
Now, now, go!
Okay, guys, move out.

36:44.302 --> 36:46.203
Avery?

36:47.271 --> 36:49.306
Can you hear me?

36:49.308 --> 36:51.241
Avery,

36:51.243 --> 36:52.342
Can you hear me?

36:52.344 --> 36:53.643
Avery!

36:53.645 --> 36:55.545
<i>Avery?</i>

36:55.547 --> 36:57.647
(groaning)

36:59.450 --> 37:02.485
We were worried about you
for a moment there.

37:02.487 --> 37:03.853
Huh.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.589
Oh, my head is splitting.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.958
(sirens blaring)
how long was I out for?

37:07.960 --> 37:10.493
Just a few minutes.

37:10.495 --> 37:11.962
Logan, did we get him?

37:11.964 --> 37:13.563
Sifter:
No.

37:13.565 --> 37:14.864
You got him, avery.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.933
It's over now.

37:38.624 --> 37:42.993
Man (over radio):
Attention all units
in the vicinity of j street.

37:42.995 --> 37:45.262
Officers requesting
backup and a bus.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.034
Call came in
an hour ago.

37:51.036 --> 37:54.337
Unis are canvassing
the area for witnesses.

37:54.339 --> 37:56.306
Can you confirm
an I.D. On the vic?

37:56.308 --> 37:57.941
Taylor pettis.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.276
Wallet and license

37:59.278 --> 38:00.744
Were in his pocket.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.045
Still had 200 bucks on him.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.546
Not a robbery.

38:03.548 --> 38:05.782
No.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.018
No, someone came here
to kill him.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.353
(camera shutter clicking)

38:14.458 --> 38:16.426
(door opening)

38:16.428 --> 38:18.461
Andrew:
<i>Hi. Come on in, please.</i>

38:18.463 --> 38:20.930
<i>What a surprise. I...</i>

38:20.932 --> 38:24.734
You didn't have to come all the
way out here to check up on me.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.970
Well, no. I-I wanted to...

38:26.972 --> 38:29.406
Tell you I was
sorry in person.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.808
I-I know my team
roughed you up, and...

38:31.810 --> 38:34.377
I just never talk about my past,

38:34.379 --> 38:36.613
So they didn't know who you are.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.782
I...

38:38.784 --> 38:41.318
I'm glad you're safe, avery.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.621
Thanks.

38:44.623 --> 38:45.955
You are okay?

38:45.957 --> 38:46.956
You're not hurt?

38:46.958 --> 38:48.458
Yeah, I'm okay.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.927
Just part of the job. (laughs)

38:50.929 --> 38:54.030
My girl-- still so tough.

38:56.968 --> 39:01.404
I mean, this guy was the one
who hacked your practice?

39:01.406 --> 39:02.839
Yes.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.874
His name was logan reeves.

39:04.876 --> 39:08.345
He knew
that I would always cherish...

39:08.347 --> 39:09.813
(groans softly)

39:09.815 --> 39:12.515
...The videos of the two
of us with hannah,

39:12.517 --> 39:14.484
That I'd always
keep them with me.

39:14.486 --> 39:18.121
He embedded a rat in one
particular video file.

39:18.123 --> 39:22.359
Basically, it allowed him
to live inside my computer.

39:22.361 --> 39:25.662
It was the video of us
with hannah in the park.

39:25.664 --> 39:28.465
The last time
all three of us were together.

39:30.768 --> 39:33.036
Can I see it?

39:33.038 --> 39:35.505
The video?
Do... Do you have it?

39:40.144 --> 39:42.779
(sighs)

39:47.051 --> 39:48.718
Oh, wow.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.787
(sighs)

39:52.390 --> 39:54.891
(laughs)

39:56.427 --> 39:57.761
Oh...

39:57.763 --> 39:59.162
(laughs)

40:02.133 --> 40:03.566
(laughs)

40:07.138 --> 40:09.439
(laughs)

40:13.811 --> 40:15.678
Oh.

40:18.649 --> 40:21.484
(laughs)

40:21.486 --> 40:23.553
Oh.

40:29.860 --> 40:33.163
You know...

40:33.165 --> 40:36.766
I remember
this whole day.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.935
Her chasing those bubbles and...

40:38.937 --> 40:41.204
And that duck that took
her whole piece of bread,

40:41.206 --> 40:44.140
And she followed him into
the water, and-and...

40:44.142 --> 40:47.710
And watching her eyes
watch the sunset, and...

40:49.447 --> 40:52.816
This was a perfect day.

40:52.818 --> 40:56.820
An hour doesn't goes by
where I don't think about her.

40:56.822 --> 40:59.489
(voice breaking):
Where I don't miss her.

40:59.491 --> 41:02.559
Losing hannah was the worst
thing I've ever gone through.

41:04.528 --> 41:08.097
Right up there with losing you.

41:08.099 --> 41:11.634
I am so sorry it
tore us apart.

41:14.572 --> 41:16.072
I am so sorry.

41:16.074 --> 41:17.507
(sighs, sniffles)

41:17.509 --> 41:19.609
Oh, me, too, andrew.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.744
Me, too.

41:26.484 --> 41:29.152
Oh, me, too, andrew.

41:57.681 --> 42:00.517
(rolling thunder)

42:02.119 --> 42:03.853
(sighs)

42:05.189 --> 42:06.689
Francine, what's going on?

42:06.691 --> 42:08.024
What happened?

42:08.026 --> 42:11.094
(crying)

42:12.663 --> 42:14.697
I killed him.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.799
Uh...

42:16.801 --> 42:19.202
I did it, daniel.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.271
(crying)

42:23.541 --> 42:26.042
I killed taylor pettis.
