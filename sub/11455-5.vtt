00:22.023 --> 00:23.105
When did she pass away?

00:23.149 --> 00:24.940
It's been eleven months now.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.817
That's gotta be hard.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.777
What I should do is I should just

00:28.821 --> 00:30.154
stay here with you.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.530
I'd love that.

00:31.574 --> 00:32.948
Well, I'd be happy.

00:32.992 --> 00:34.241
You got lazy and lost XHP.

00:34.285 --> 00:36.118
I got this.

00:36.162 --> 00:37.244
You know, I'd really like
to think I was right

00:37.288 --> 00:38.871
considering you for Managing Partner.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.080
Learn this guy's face.

00:40.124 --> 00:41.373
He's the devil.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.751
My client is suing the
shit out of his client.

00:43.794 --> 00:44.752
Speak of the devil...

00:44.795 --> 00:45.794
Did you two come together?

00:45.838 --> 00:46.795
Ah.

00:46.839 --> 00:47.963
He's signing but

00:48.007 --> 00:50.174
he wants Erin to head it.

00:52.845 --> 00:53.844
Want to get a beer?

00:53.888 --> 00:55.554
You tell me your goals.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.022
Hello?

01:05.066 --> 01:07.816
Uh, you're breaking up a little bit.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.486
Is this a uh, secure line?

01:10.529 --> 01:11.820
It is.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.697
Sorry, I just have really bad reception.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.616
I asked how you got my number?

01:15.659 --> 01:17.701
I got your number from Kevin Young.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.661
Okay.

01:19.705 --> 01:20.454
Listen...

01:20.498 --> 01:22.122
There's one more thing,

01:22.166 --> 01:24.083
I'm travelling with my wife.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.709
I understand.

01:25.753 --> 01:26.752
Do you?

01:26.796 --> 01:27.836
I do.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.630
Is it okay if I call you back Tuesday

01:29.673 --> 01:31.715
and we can confirm and
sort out the details?

01:31.759 --> 01:33.008
Of course. I'll speak to you soon.

01:33.052 --> 01:34.134
Great.

01:34.178 --> 01:35.469
Thank you.

01:35.513 --> 01:36.762
Bye.

01:41.143 --> 01:43.811
Sounds like business is going good.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.104
Yeah, it's fine.

01:45.147 --> 01:47.564
That's good.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.025
To be honest, I'd rather
spend all my time with you.

01:52.071 --> 01:53.821
Oh, yeah?

01:53.864 --> 01:56.698
Just as long as you know I
don't expect that from you.

01:56.742 --> 01:57.991
You know that, right?

01:58.035 --> 01:59.785
- I know.
- Okay.

01:59.829 --> 02:01.787
Just being honest.

02:01.831 --> 02:03.997
Okay.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.999
What we should do, you
and I, is sit down,

02:06.043 --> 02:09.169
and figure out an arrangement
and make that happen.

02:09.213 --> 02:12.005
Yeah, that'd be amazing. I'd love that.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.132
Me, too.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.761
Ah, thought you'd forgotten me.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.180
- Now, you want something?
- No, thank you.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.473
Cheers.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.689
Is there any way we could be alone?

02:28.732 --> 02:32.025
A bottle of vodka, get some popcorn...

02:32.069 --> 02:34.194
Maybe get two bottles of vodka.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.613
Oh, and the girl wants,

02:36.657 --> 02:37.990
she wants canned tuna,

02:38.033 --> 02:40.075
so see if you can find some of that uh,

02:40.119 --> 02:41.535
dolphin-safe stuff,

02:41.579 --> 02:42.995
any organic, you know
what to look for right?

02:43.038 --> 02:43.996
Okay.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.206
Dolphin-safe, that's the way to go.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.099
Michael!

04:09.333 --> 04:11.083
Michael!

04:16.339 --> 04:18.130
Michael?

04:36.026 --> 04:37.567
Michael!

04:42.366 --> 04:44.324
Michael!

04:53.210 --> 04:55.043
It's great, huh?

04:58.007 --> 04:59.131
What's the matter?

05:41.499 --> 05:43.557

05:46.930 --> 05:48.138
Peter Gramercy.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.765
Hi, this is Chelsea Rayne.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.309
I got your message,
just calling you back.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.520
Yes.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.899
I represent the estate of Michael Cilic.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.151
The estate?

06:01.195 --> 06:03.987
He passed away last Thursday evening.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.906
Cardiac arrest.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.657
My condolences.

06:11.455 --> 06:14.915
He named you as a
beneficiary in his will.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.125
I was hoping you could
come by my office,

06:17.169 --> 06:19.294
so that we could go over the details.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.018
Sam?

06:35.062 --> 06:38.271
Are you Chelsea?

06:38.315 --> 06:41.233
This is Shannon.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.234
Hi...

06:42.277 --> 06:43.360
Chelsea.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.694
Excuse me.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.862
Yes, sir?

06:45.906 --> 06:47.447
You serve a 18-year-old scotch with ice

06:47.491 --> 06:49.449
that looks like it came
from a soda fountain?

06:49.493 --> 06:51.535
Could I have a more substantial
block of ice back there?

06:51.578 --> 06:52.536
I'll check, sir.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.496
Yes, please check.

06:54.540 --> 06:58.041
And if you don't have the
proper ice, just leave it neat.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.376
Right away.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.133
So, how'd you guys meet?

07:06.176 --> 07:07.467
Do you want to...?

07:07.511 --> 07:09.302
No, go ahead.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.055
Uh, a mutual friend's birthday party.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.224
It was pretty funny.

07:14.268 --> 07:15.475
I uh...

07:15.519 --> 07:17.310
I didn't like him at all.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.396
I- I thought he was really conceited.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.314
He wouldn't talk to me.

07:21.358 --> 07:24.443
I must have asked him about
a hundred questions,

07:24.486 --> 07:26.445
and he just- he wouldn't say anything.

07:26.488 --> 07:30.073
Turns out he's just shy.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.825
I'm not shy.

07:31.869 --> 07:32.993
Yes, you are.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.494
No, I am not.

07:34.538 --> 07:35.620
Yes, you are.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.497
Okay. That's enough.

07:41.545 --> 07:44.754
Well, it seems like you guys
have a lot of fun together.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.219
You guys wanna do some shots?

07:54.391 --> 07:56.308
It's a $12,000 watch.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.226
Makes phone calls, never lost a second.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.561
She is $3,000.

07:59.605 --> 08:00.520
Where the fuck is she?

08:00.564 --> 08:02.939
- I know.
- Yeah.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.504
- I mean what am I paying her
for exactly? - I don't know.

08:25.547 --> 08:26.505
I guess to leave.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.548
No, don't talk about money.

08:28.592 --> 08:31.009
Sweetie, why don't we call you a cab?

08:31.053 --> 08:32.302
No, no.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.720
I'm fine.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.806
Oh honey, can you...?

08:43.065 --> 08:46.399
Should we go over here?

08:48.987 --> 08:50.695
This damn rug!

09:01.542 --> 09:04.334
No.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.127
Are you okay?

09:06.171 --> 09:09.422
I'm so sorry, I never do this.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.423
It's okay.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.592
Three thousand fucking dollars.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.095
Do you need to use the bathroom again?

09:15.138 --> 09:17.430
Let's just get her clothes back on.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.251
Hello.

09:46.295 --> 09:47.919
Are you sleeping?

10:01.727 --> 10:03.768
Harder.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.690
Harder.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.862
What's going on with you?

10:16.325 --> 10:17.824
Nothing.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.200
Did you cum?

11:00.243 --> 11:01.826
Yeah, did you?

11:03.789 --> 11:05.872
No.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.749
No...

11:07.793 --> 11:09.501
I'm...

11:22.683 --> 11:24.641
Are you stressed out?

11:27.521 --> 11:28.895
No.

11:31.608 --> 11:34.818
I promised I'd take my kids to school.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.490
You can just tell me to leave.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.708
I'm not your friend.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.919
Maybe I can be...

11:52.963 --> 11:55.797
at some point.

11:55.841 --> 11:58.007
But not at four o'clock in the morning.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.638
Feel free to crash here.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.265
Take a shower.

12:05.308 --> 12:06.683
Whatever.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.309
I gotta go.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.864
David?

12:22.951 --> 12:25.493
David, is that you?

12:52.689 --> 12:55.648
I'll be out in a second.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.273
Christine, hi.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.691
Erin.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.944
I thought I heard someone.
You're here early.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.695
Yeah, I just wanted to get here

13:42.739 --> 13:44.072
before the day starts getting crazy.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.365
Get some work done.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.617
Is that something I can help you with?

13:49.412 --> 13:50.662
No, just...

13:50.705 --> 13:52.372
getting familiar with David's work,

13:52.415 --> 13:53.873
going through my own process.

13:53.917 --> 13:57.126
Oh, I'm sure you are.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.586
You want to grab lunch today?

13:58.630 --> 14:01.714
We can talk about your
experience at the firm so far.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.883
I have an opening at two.

14:03.927 --> 14:07.136
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.
I'd love that.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.848
Cool.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.432
I'll see you at two.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.859
But uh, you know, when we find it,

14:20.902 --> 14:22.318
we will, so...

14:22.362 --> 14:24.904
oh gentleman, I just have
to go but you listen...

14:24.948 --> 14:26.322
It's not official,

14:26.366 --> 14:29.409
and the committee still needs
to make the final vote,

14:29.452 --> 14:32.829
but it's clear the way
everyone's leaning.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.790
I'm sorry, I'm not clear
what you're saying.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.750
They're promoting you
to Managing Partner.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.419
Next week.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.963
Goes without saying, don't
tell them I told you.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.592
That's...

14:45.635 --> 14:47.927
That's great, that's...

14:47.971 --> 14:50.638
Huh...

14:50.682 --> 14:52.807
I just wanted to give you some lead time

14:52.851 --> 14:56.019
so you could get things in order.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.437
What about XHP?

14:57.480 --> 14:58.563
Erin's heading it.

14:58.607 --> 15:00.732
You don't have to worry about that.

15:00.775 --> 15:04.193
Managing Partner is a
high-level position.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.488
I've been working with
XHP for two years.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.073
I'd like to see it through.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.910
Continue working closely
with Erin on it.

15:11.953 --> 15:15.079
If you wanna put in the
extra time, go for it.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.456
But you're only getting one salary.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.625
I know.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.251
We'll consider it pro bono work.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.423
- Congratulations.
- Mmm.

15:25.467 --> 15:28.051
You know, I've heard great
things about your work.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.469
How's it going with David?

15:29.512 --> 15:31.638
It's great. I'm really learning a lot.

15:31.681 --> 15:35.475
It's really impressive
how much he can juggle.

15:35.518 --> 15:36.976
The Sancerre.

15:38.688 --> 15:39.979
Thanks.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.481
Are we ready to order?

15:41.524 --> 15:43.024
Not quite yet.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.905
Did you know he's going
through a divorce?

15:48.949 --> 15:51.491
It must be a trying time for him.

15:51.534 --> 15:54.160
He didn't uh, mention that.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.037
Seventeen years.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.038
Megan...

15:57.082 --> 15:59.791
You met at the party.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.834
He's got two kids, Chris and Kyle.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.962
Sixteen and fourteen.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.507
I shouldn't bring it up.

16:07.550 --> 16:08.883
I just thought you should know,

16:08.927 --> 16:12.679
in case it changes his behavior at work.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.848
Sometimes he doesn't
think before he acts.

16:15.892 --> 16:16.766
But...

16:16.810 --> 16:18.518
You work with him.

16:18.561 --> 16:21.521
You're smart. I'm sure
you've noticed that.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.774
Yeah, I mean he- he definitely
knows what he wants.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.234
Yeah.

16:26.277 --> 16:29.988
"He knows what he wants."

16:30.031 --> 16:31.739
Thank you for being
honest with me though.

16:31.783 --> 16:32.991
Anytime.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.212
So thorough.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.006
You're leading this now.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.674
You got me into this.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.092
Into XHP's pants?

16:51.136 --> 16:53.553
- Mmm...
- His name is Emery.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.096
Well, the names change,

16:55.140 --> 16:57.640
you're just using the
tools at your disposal.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.725
How's Christine?

16:58.768 --> 17:00.810
Nice deflection tactic.

17:00.854 --> 17:01.853
As your intern?

17:01.896 --> 17:04.731
That's not what you were asking.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.523
I don't need your help.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.862
Yes, you do.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.030
No, I don't.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.698
If anything, I can focus
better without you

17:13.742 --> 17:16.242
in my fucking face,
making snarky comments.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.500
They're promoting me.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.629
To Managing Partner?

17:28.673 --> 17:30.381
No, to Head of Maintenance.

17:32.677 --> 17:33.801
Yeah, Managing Partner.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.344
Sorry.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.929
That was shitty.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.474
I just wanted to let you
know before they did.

17:41.853 --> 17:45.021
I asked to stay on XHP with you.

17:45.065 --> 17:48.900
Thanks for the consolation prize.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.610
I know.

17:50.653 --> 17:53.362
You deserved it.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.947
No, I didn't.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.786
Have a seat.

17:59.829 --> 18:00.995
You live in the city?

18:01.039 --> 18:02.205
Yes.

18:05.877 --> 18:08.169
Okay.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.129
Well...

18:10.173 --> 18:12.840
Michael amended his will two months ago.

18:12.884 --> 18:17.345
I'm sure you understand this sets
off alarm bells within his family.

18:17.388 --> 18:19.430
I'm sure this is very hard for them.

18:21.351 --> 18:25.061
$500,000 was left in the
name of Chelsea Rayne.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.607
Are you Chelsea Rayne?

18:34.072 --> 18:37.198
All Michael left was
your telephone number.

18:37.242 --> 18:41.077
He said you two had become very close.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.121
We were very close.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.666
You'll need more than a telephone number

18:46.709 --> 18:49.210
to prove your identity
to the Probate Court.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.965
Do you have an attorney?

18:54.008 --> 18:55.842
We saw each other once or twice a week

18:55.885 --> 18:57.844
for the past four-and-a-half,
five months.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.680
He was always generous, but
I did not expect this.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.976
I'm sorry, I don't
have any other lawyers

19:05.019 --> 19:06.936
that I trust that I can
talk to about this.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.021
Mmm, admittedly, I was
looking forward to

19:09.065 --> 19:11.482
a nice lunch and a little bit of...

19:11.526 --> 19:13.860
You know.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.195
I didn't know this was
gonna be a business lunch.

19:19.075 --> 19:21.409
Okay, how many um,

19:21.452 --> 19:23.035
"clients" or...

19:23.079 --> 19:24.912
"men" do you see?

19:24.956 --> 19:26.706
Is that necessary?

19:26.749 --> 19:28.374
So I'm gonna help you, but you
gotta be straight with me.

19:28.418 --> 19:29.792
Come on.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.003
A few, including you.

19:34.299 --> 19:38.217
- Does your family know?
- No.

19:38.261 --> 19:39.969
If you decide you want this inheritance,

19:40.013 --> 19:41.846
and uh, you're willing to
prove that you're Chelsea,

19:41.890 --> 19:44.307
it becomes public record.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.518
Anyone has access to the will
once it goes through Probate.

19:53.109 --> 19:56.235
I'm gonna have to think about that.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.362
Well, take some time.

20:02.285 --> 20:05.077
Can I ask you another question?

20:05.121 --> 20:06.370
Go ahead.

20:06.414 --> 20:07.997
Ask away.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.958
Why would two lawyers from
opposing teams share information?

20:11.002 --> 20:13.085
Unless the judge ordered it,
they would have no reason to.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.128
That's illegal.

20:14.172 --> 20:17.423
- That's-that's collusion.
- Right.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.550
What kind of case is this?

20:19.594 --> 20:20.968
Medical patent.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.095
What's it worth?

20:23.139 --> 20:24.096
Billions?

20:24.140 --> 20:25.348
There you go.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.059
There's a whole host of
reasons right there.

20:28.102 --> 20:31.103
You sure that's what's going on?

20:31.147 --> 20:32.563
No.

20:32.607 --> 20:36.067
No, I can't be certain.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.526
Now, I got a question for you.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.987
This, me and you, now.

20:40.031 --> 20:42.365
This is business, right?

20:42.408 --> 20:44.450
It's always been business.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.255
You've been re-assigned
to Skip Hadderly.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.259
Why?

21:01.302 --> 21:02.635
I don't know.

21:02.679 --> 21:05.221
Talk to Evans?

21:05.265 --> 21:06.889
David didn't say.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.182
He must have said something.

21:08.226 --> 21:09.684
He must have given a reason why.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.978
No, he didn't. He doesn't have to.

21:12.021 --> 21:14.230
He just said he wants a new intern.

21:14.274 --> 21:16.315
Skip's great, you'll like him.

21:16.359 --> 21:17.775
Just let it go.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.195
I don't think this will
take that long, will it?

21:21.239 --> 21:22.446
Well, I cancelled the coffee,

21:22.490 --> 21:24.657
I doubt we'll be done
before it gets here.

21:24.701 --> 21:26.325
You boys take it easy on me, alright?

21:30.415 --> 21:33.916
Before we make our final decision,

21:33.960 --> 21:36.085
we'd just like to hear from you,

21:36.129 --> 21:38.629
how you see our firm moving forward.

21:38.673 --> 21:40.172
Think of it as a...

21:40.216 --> 21:41.549
conversation.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.134
Right.

21:43.177 --> 21:46.637
Casual conversation across
from five men staring at me.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.392
Look...

21:51.436 --> 21:53.227
You know me.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.646
I'm not an idealist.

21:55.690 --> 22:00.568
We need to move in directions
which may not feel right.

22:00.611 --> 22:03.070
The market is changing at a rate

22:03.114 --> 22:05.489
that is exponential our
current resources.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.511
I want to see you.

22:29.307 --> 22:32.224
I'm sorry, we can't keep doing this.

22:32.268 --> 22:33.601
I know.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.480
Just one more time?

22:42.236 --> 22:43.861
Yeah.

22:47.283 --> 22:48.866
Yeah.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.578
Uh-huh.

22:52.622 --> 22:55.289
Yeah, she is.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.542
Mmm-hmm.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.420
Just a second.

23:11.432 --> 23:12.765
She's just an intern.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.809
There's nothing to worry about.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.688
I checked everything.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.274
It's not going to trial, I got it.

23:24.028 --> 23:27.947
I will make sure that it
is not going to trial.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.619
Yeah.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.704
Our deal still stands.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.789
Yeah.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.374
Checks go to Quorta.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.626
Still the same.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.586
Alright, I gotta go.

23:50.721 --> 23:52.930
Sorry, I had to go to the bathroom.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.769
Who was that?

23:58.813 --> 24:00.146
That?

24:03.151 --> 24:04.692
That was Ben.

24:04.735 --> 24:07.445
You met him.

24:07.488 --> 24:08.696
He and I...

24:08.739 --> 24:09.613
- We used to know each other...
- From college.

24:09.657 --> 24:10.739
Yeah.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.826
Ben Holgrem, I met him in your office.

24:13.870 --> 24:17.496
His client's suing the
shit out of our client.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.165
You know.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.083
You're still in school?

24:21.127 --> 24:22.585
You'll get it,

24:22.628 --> 24:24.753
when your friends start
working for different sides.

24:24.797 --> 24:28.090
I don't have any friends.

25:03.628 --> 25:05.920
Are you waiting for me to fuck you?

25:09.342 --> 25:11.050
Yeah.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.646
And if I don't?

25:25.608 --> 25:27.816
Then I'll have to fire you.

25:45.753 --> 25:46.919
Your skin.

25:46.963 --> 25:51.465
It feels so good, I want to pass out.

25:51.509 --> 25:52.258
Oh, man.

26:10.987 --> 26:12.361
Hey...

26:12.405 --> 26:13.696
We're really happy to have you on board.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.072
I'm just gonna have you read

26:15.116 --> 26:16.615
a few articles of the work I'm doing

26:16.659 --> 26:17.741
so-so you can get up to speed.

26:17.785 --> 26:19.577
- Okay?
- Great.

26:19.620 --> 26:23.247
And Sara, could you- could you get
our copy of the Eisner application?

26:23.291 --> 26:24.832
And listen,

26:24.875 --> 26:27.126
if you need anything at all,
door's always open, okay?

26:27.169 --> 26:29.795
Great. Thanks, Skip.

26:29.839 --> 26:31.255
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:40.558 --> 26:42.016
- Don't be fancy.
- Okay.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.976
I promise I won't make it more
complicated than it has to be.

26:44.020 --> 26:45.686
Just cut and paste. Real easy.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.104
Okay, great.

27:13.049 --> 27:15.132
Are you waiting for me to fuck you?

27:18.179 --> 27:20.763
Yeah.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.264
And if I don't?

27:24.977 --> 27:27.186
Then I'll have to fire you.

27:33.861 --> 27:36.779
It's not going to trial, I got it.

27:36.822 --> 27:40.866
I will make sure it is
not going to trial.

27:42.703 --> 27:44.328
Our deal still stands.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.081
Checks go to Quorta.
