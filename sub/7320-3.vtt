WEBVTT

00:00.767 --> 00:01.533
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:01.567 --> 00:03.300
SO HEY,
YOU'RE AN INTERN... AGAIN.

00:03.333 --> 00:05.400
YEAH.
I WON'T TELL ANYBODY.

00:05.433 --> 00:07.133
(George)
IZZIE, MEET REALLY OLD GUY.
(groans)

00:07.167 --> 00:10.500
THIS IS
THE BEST BREAKUP EVER.
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DIDN'T
BREAK UP A LONG TIME AGO.

00:10.533 --> 00:13.333
(Cristina) HE'S GONE.
YOU'RE MY SISTER,
YOU'RE MY FAMILY.

00:13.367 --> 00:15.267
YOU'RE ALL I'VE GOT.

00:15.300 --> 00:17.567
WE HAVE THE SAME DAD.
WE DON'T HAVE
THE SAME DAD, LEXIE.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.367
I THINK MY HUSBAND'S HAVING
AN AFFAIR.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.267
I'M GOING TO TELL HER.

00:22.867 --> 00:24.367
(Meredith)
DOCTORS GIVE PATIENTS

00:24.400 --> 00:26.033
A NUMBER OF THINGS.

00:26.067 --> 00:29.600
WE GIVE THEM MEDICINE,
WE GIVE THEM ADVICE.

00:29.633 --> 00:30.600
(elevator bell dings)

00:30.633 --> 00:33.600
AND MOST OF THE TIME,

00:33.633 --> 00:35.500
WE GIVE THEM
OUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

00:35.533 --> 00:38.033
I HEARD HE SAVED A GUY
WHO CODED YESTERDAY,

00:38.067 --> 00:39.367
BY HIMSELF.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.467
HE JUST KNOWS THINGS--
NEVER MESSES UP IN ROUNDS,

00:41.500 --> 00:43.233
ALWAYS HAS THE ANSWER.

00:43.267 --> 00:44.433
AND HE'S SO CALM.

00:44.467 --> 00:46.367
I'M ALWAYS TERRIFIED,
BUT HE'S, LIKE, STEADY.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.767
BEST INTERN EVER.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.733
(whispers) HEY,
WHO ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?
(whispers) GEORGE O'MALLEY.

00:51.767 --> 00:53.267
SERIOUSLY?

00:53.300 --> 00:55.233
DON'T THEY KNOW THAT HE--
SHH.

00:55.267 --> 00:58.700
BUT BY FAR THE HARDEST THING
YOU CAN GIVE A PATIENT

00:58.733 --> 01:00.500
IS THE TRUTH.

01:00.533 --> 01:03.733
YOU KNOW O'MALLEY'S GOT
THESE MORONS SNOWED?

01:03.767 --> 01:07.133
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
HE'S A REPEATER.
YEAH, WHATEVER.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.067
(dings)
(Derek) HEY.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.633
HEY.

01:10.667 --> 01:12.800
***

01:12.833 --> 01:14.700
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

01:14.733 --> 01:16.100
GOOD.

01:16.133 --> 01:17.667
GREAT.

01:17.700 --> 01:20.233
***

01:20.267 --> 01:22.533
THE TRUTH IS HARD.

01:22.567 --> 01:25.367
THE TRUTH... IS AWKWARD.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.567
AND VERY OFTEN...

01:26.600 --> 01:29.300
(dings)

01:29.333 --> 01:31.267
THE TRUTH HURTS.
DAMN IT.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.333
BYE.
BYE.

01:33.367 --> 01:35.033
***

01:35.067 --> 01:36.267
SHE'S DOING McDREAMY.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.700
SHE'S DOING McDREAMY
AND LYING ABOUT IT.
THAT'S GREAT.

01:38.733 --> 01:40.733
SHE THINKS I'M WEAK,
THAT I'M FRAGILE.

01:40.767 --> 01:44.100
LIKE I CAN'T HANDLE IT
'CAUSE OF BURKE.
POOR CRISTINA. ALL ALONE.

01:44.133 --> 01:46.167
DAMN RIGHT. POOR CRISTINA.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.533
***

01:47.567 --> 01:50.133
GEORGE, WHAT HAPPENED?

01:50.167 --> 01:53.300
I MEAN, PEOPLE SAY
THEY WANT THE TRUTH.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.400
***

01:55.433 --> 01:57.367
BUT DO THEY REALLY?

01:57.400 --> 01:59.100
OH. (chuckles)

01:59.133 --> 02:01.433
(laughs)
DO I HAVE SEX HAIR?

02:01.467 --> 02:04.233
UH, IF I DID MY JOB RIGHT.
YOU GO AHEAD.

02:04.267 --> 02:06.667
WHAT?
YOU GO AHEAD.
I'LL WAIT A MINUTE.

02:06.700 --> 02:10.067
SO THIS ISN'T JUST BREAKUP SEX.
THIS IS SECRET BREAKUP SEX.

02:10.100 --> 02:12.400
IS THIS ABOUT CRISTINA,
THIS MORNING IN THE ELEVATOR?

02:12.433 --> 02:14.733
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO, YOU KNOW?

02:14.767 --> 02:16.667
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT,
THE WHOLE BURKE THING.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.600
I MEAN, I WANT TO BE
A GOOD FRIEND.

02:18.633 --> 02:20.733
I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

02:20.767 --> 02:22.633
BUT YOU DON'T TAKE CARE
OF CRISTINA.

02:22.667 --> 02:24.567
OKAY, SO BY BEING WITH ME
YOU'RE CHEATING ON CRISTINA?

02:24.600 --> 02:26.733
JUST, IF SHE KNEW ABOUT
YOU AND ME--
YOU'D HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

02:26.767 --> 02:28.667
YOU'D HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT YOU AND ME,

02:28.700 --> 02:30.467
AND IT'D BE
A LONG CONVERSATION,

02:30.500 --> 02:33.667
AND THERE'D BE NO TIME
LEFT OVER TO TALK ABOUT HER.
I TOLD YOU,
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

02:33.700 --> 02:34.733
MM-HMM.

02:34.767 --> 02:37.133
PIERCE, YOU'RE IN THE PIT.
JAMES, NEED YOU IN PEDS.

02:37.167 --> 02:39.567
LAURA, YOU'RE ON SCUT.
I WAS ON SCUT YESTERDAY.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.433
OH, AND JUST FOR THAT,
YOU'RE ON SCUT TOMORROW.

02:42.467 --> 02:43.767
GET LOST.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.633
DR. KAREV,
THIS IS DR. NORMAL SHALES.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.533
HEY.
OH, A STRONG HANDSHAKE.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

02:49.567 --> 02:52.433
NORMAN IS TRANSFERRING IN
FROM U.C.L.A.

02:52.467 --> 02:54.667
I WANT HIM TO WORK WITH YOU.
OH, ARE YOU
THE NEW O.B.-G.Y.N. GUY?

02:54.700 --> 02:57.467
(chuckles)
I DON'T HAVE A SPECIALTY YET.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.733
NORMAN IS AN INTERN.
YOU'LL BE HIS RESIDENT.

02:59.767 --> 03:02.100
HE'S MY INTERN?

03:02.133 --> 03:05.200
DON'T WORRY, SON. THIS TUGBOAT'S
READY TO PULL HIS OWN WEIGHT.

03:05.233 --> 03:08.233
AGE IS JUST A NUMBER,
RIGHT, NORMAN?
ABSOLUTELY.

03:08.267 --> 03:11.500
PRETTY IMPORTANT NUMBER.

03:11.533 --> 03:12.467
HEY.

03:12.500 --> 03:13.433
HEY.

03:13.467 --> 03:14.833
YOU OKAY?

03:14.867 --> 03:16.400
I DON'T KNOW.

03:16.433 --> 03:18.833
I THINK IT'S ALL
JUST HITTING ME--

03:18.867 --> 03:21.500
YOU KNOW,
STUPID BURKE DUMPING ME

03:21.533 --> 03:24.433
AND THEN STUPID MAMA
COMING TO RECLAIM HER...

03:24.467 --> 03:27.333
MAGIC NECKLACE.

03:27.367 --> 03:29.267
DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT?

03:29.300 --> 03:32.133
NO, NOT REALLY,
NOT... YET.

03:32.167 --> 03:34.067
OKAY. WELL, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO--

03:34.100 --> 03:36.800
YOU KNOW, I JUST WISH I HAD
A GOOD, BLOODY SURGERY.

03:36.833 --> 03:40.167
YOU KNOW, BLOODY SURGERIES
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

03:42.233 --> 03:46.100
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR...
(sighs) FOLLOW ME.

03:48.167 --> 03:51.033
OH, JOANNE, THIS IS WHY
YOU AND I NEED TO GET SICK,

03:51.067 --> 03:52.733
THESE DOCTORS.

03:52.767 --> 03:53.933
ONE'S MORE HANDSOME
THAN THE NEXT.
(Joanne laughs)

03:53.967 --> 03:57.500
(woman) OH, AND HERE COMES
THE HANDSOMEST ONE OF THEM ALL.

03:57.533 --> 03:59.233
HI, DR. WEBBER.
CONNIE.

03:59.267 --> 04:01.400
HE TOOK MY APPENDIX OUT
THREE YEARS AGO.

04:01.433 --> 04:04.267
BARELY LEFT A SCAR.
HOW'S ADELE?

04:04.300 --> 04:06.600
UM, OH, SHE'S GOOD, GOOD.

04:06.633 --> 04:08.300
UH, MARRIAGE IS HARD.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.433
UH, BUT WE'RE DATING AGAIN.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.700
UH, AND SHE AGREED
TO DATE ME TONIGHT.

04:12.733 --> 04:15.333
(clears throat) BUT, UM...

04:15.367 --> 04:17.300
MORE--MORE IMPORTANTLY,
HOW--HOW ARE YOU DOING?

04:17.333 --> 04:19.433
OH, I JUST HAD A LITTLE BUMP
ON MY TONGUE REMOVED IS ALL.

04:19.467 --> 04:22.300
COUPLE OF TASTE BUDS. TURNS OUT
IT WAS A LITTLE TOUCH OF CANCER.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.333
SO I'M HERE TO HAVE
THE REST OUT.

04:24.367 --> 04:26.500
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THE CANCER,
NOT THE TASTE BUDS.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.100
(women laugh)

04:28.133 --> 04:29.700
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
HOW BAD IT IS

04:29.733 --> 04:31.833
BECAUSE DR. SLOAN OVER THERE
HAS BEEN AWFULLY QUIET.

04:31.867 --> 04:34.733
'CAUSE YOU DON'T LET HIM
GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE IS WHY.

04:34.767 --> 04:36.667
(laughs)
UH, HOW IS SHE, DR. SLOAN?

04:36.700 --> 04:39.100
WELL, WE JUST GOT BACK
THE PATHOLOGY REPORT.

04:39.133 --> 04:40.467
CONNIE, UNFORTUNATELY,

04:40.500 --> 04:43.200
THE CANCER IS A BIT MORE
WIDESPREAD THAN WE'D HOPED.

04:43.233 --> 04:45.167
IT'S OVER 60% OF YOUR TONGUE.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.100
WELL, WHAT--
WHAT DOES SHE DO, CHEMO?

04:48.133 --> 04:52.300
I THINK THE, UH, BEST BET
IS A MICROVASCULAR FREE FLAP.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.700
DR. GREY?

04:53.733 --> 04:56.033
UH, HE'LL REMOVE THE CANCEROUS
PART OF THE TONGUE,

04:56.067 --> 04:58.533
AND THEN RECONSTRUCT IT
WITH A STRIP OF FLESH

04:58.567 --> 05:00.200
FROM YOUR LEGS.

05:00.233 --> 05:01.567
GEORGE?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.500
UH, THE EXTRA FLESH
WILL PROVIDE THE BULK

05:03.533 --> 05:06.500
YOUR TONGUE NEEDS TO BREATHE
PROPERLY, CHEW, SWALLOW.

05:06.533 --> 05:08.300
AND TALK?

05:12.833 --> 05:14.167
(Connie) DR. SLOAN...

05:14.200 --> 05:15.733
I'LL BE ABLE
TO TALK, WON'T I?

05:15.767 --> 05:19.067
YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO TALK, CONNIE.

05:19.100 --> 05:22.200
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW WELL
YOU'LL BE UNDERSTOOD.

05:24.833 --> 05:27.667
YOU'LL BE OKAY.
IT'LL BE OKAY.

05:29.067 --> 05:31.133
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY CLINIC, KAREV?

05:31.167 --> 05:33.167
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WORK
IN THE CLINIC ANYMORE.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.033
OH, I DON'T,
BUT I THOUGHT I COULD GET

05:35.067 --> 05:37.067
MY NEW INTERN NORMAN HERE
SETTLED IN WITH YOU.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.767
BAILEY'S THE BEST.
YOU'LL REALLY LEARN FROM HER.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.667
OH, PLEASED TO MEET YOU.
YOU WANT TO LEAVE
NORMAN WITH ME

05:42.700 --> 05:43.633
WHILE YOU TROLL
FOR SURGERIES.

05:43.667 --> 05:44.633
(chuckles)

05:44.667 --> 05:46.500
(chuckles)

05:46.533 --> 05:48.833
(lowers voice)
THE DUDE'S GOT A BUM HIP,

05:48.867 --> 05:50.567
AND HE SMELLS LIKE
ARTHRITIS CREAM.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.700
HE CAN'T KEEP UP.
COME ON.

05:52.733 --> 05:55.300
DO ME A FAVOR,
AND I'LL DO YOU A FAVOR.

05:55.333 --> 05:57.533
I'M CALLING IN MY FAVOR NOW.
CURTAIN FIVE.

05:57.567 --> 06:00.833
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR INTERN
AND SHOW HIM HOW WE DO AN H&P.

06:00.867 --> 06:04.667
NICE TO MEET YOU, NORMAN.
THANK YOU.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.267
HUNTER, UH, I'M DR. KAREV.

06:06.300 --> 06:09.100
THIS IS DR. SHALES.
WHAT'S, UH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:09.133 --> 06:10.633
MY SON IS ON DRUGS.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.400
I'M NOT ON DRUGS, MOM.

06:12.433 --> 06:15.267
I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY.
I KNOW THE SIGNS.

06:15.300 --> 06:18.167
HE'S LETHARGIC, IRRITABLE,
AND THE LAST TWO MONTHS,

06:18.200 --> 06:20.100
HIS SCHOOLWORK'S
GONE DOWN THE DRAIN.
I'M NOT ON DRUGS.

06:20.133 --> 06:22.100
OKAY, THERE--THERE ARE
A HOST OF REASONS

06:22.133 --> 06:24.567
WHY YOUR SON COULD BE
EXHIBITING THOSE SYMPTOMS.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.467
UM, I THINK WE SHOULD RUN SOME
TESTS, SEE IF THERE'S ANY--
BUT FIRST A DRUG TEST,
DR. SHALES.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.200
I'M RIGHT
TO WANT A DRUG TEST.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.567
YEAH, I-I JUST SAID THAT--
MRS. CHAPMAN,
YOU ARE NOT WRONG.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.833
MY MARY BETH, GOD REST HER SOUL,
WAS JUST LIKE YOU.

06:35.867 --> 06:37.333
WHEN ONE OF OUR KIDS

06:37.367 --> 06:39.667
STARTED HEADING DOWN
THAT SLIPPERY SLOPE,

06:39.700 --> 06:41.733
SHE JUST KNEW IT.

06:41.767 --> 06:45.500
YOU HAVE A MOTHER'S INSTINCT.
RIGHT, DR. KAREV?

06:45.533 --> 06:49.033
YEAH, RIGHT.

06:49.067 --> 06:50.400
(sighs) OKAY.

06:50.433 --> 06:51.767
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:51.800 --> 06:53.700
(scoffs)
GEORGE,
IT'S REALLY OLD GUY.

06:53.733 --> 06:55.633
WE COULD BRING
A MARCHING BAND IN HERE,

06:55.667 --> 06:57.567
AND HE WOULDN'T KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.767
WHAT HAPPENED WITH CALLIE?
WHAT HAPPENED? I--

07:00.800 --> 07:02.633
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
TELL HER LAST NIGHT.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.400
I TRIED,
BUT SHE WOULD NOT LET ME.

07:04.433 --> 07:06.200
SHE--SHE WOULDN'T LET ME.

07:06.233 --> 07:09.100
I WANTED TO KILL HER,
BUT THEN I COULDN'T KILL HER

07:09.133 --> 07:11.167
BECAUSE SHE DID HELP ME
THROUGH A LOT OF STUFF.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.800
AND IT WAS A LOT OF STUFF
AND, YOU KNOW,

07:13.833 --> 07:15.733
SHE DID HELP ME THROUGH IT.

07:15.767 --> 07:17.700
BUT THEN I WANTED
TO KILL HER AGAIN,

07:17.733 --> 07:19.267
BECAUSE WHO MARRIES SOMEONE
WHO JUST BURIED THEIR FATHER?

07:19.300 --> 07:21.733
AND THEN I WENT TO BED.
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

07:21.767 --> 07:23.367
WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT?

07:23.400 --> 07:27.267
I TOLD YOU I NEEDED
A MINUTE BEFORE ROUNDS.
WE HEARD
YOU SAVED A GUY YESTERDAY.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.833
(George) WHAT?
ROUNDS.

07:28.867 --> 07:30.333
EXCUSE ME.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.767
(Izzie) WE'LL START IN HERE.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.100
GRACIELLA, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT REALLY OLD GUY?

07:34.133 --> 07:35.367
HE HAS A NAME.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.533
I KNOW HE HAS A NAME. WE CALL
HIM REALLY OLD GUY. CATCH UP.

07:38.567 --> 07:41.167
82-YEAR-OLD,
SEMICOMATOSE MALE,

07:41.200 --> 07:43.567
UH, CAME IN A YEAR AGO,
STATUS POST FALL

07:43.600 --> 07:46.833
AND IS POST-OP DAY 352 FROM--
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THAT
HE HASN'T WOKEN UP FOR A YEAR.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.067
SO WHAT'S THE TREATMENT PLAN?

07:49.100 --> 07:50.433
UM...

07:50.467 --> 07:51.533
UM...

07:51.567 --> 07:53.500
UM...
IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE.

07:53.533 --> 07:56.200
DAILY LABS AND DIALYSIS
THREE TIMES A WEEK.

07:56.233 --> 08:00.267
DON'T BOTHER
WITH ANY MORE DIALYSIS.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.800
I PLAN TO DIE TODAY,

08:02.833 --> 08:04.367
SO IT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

08:07.833 --> 08:09.533
NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:09.567 --> 08:13.333
AND WHILE I THINK
REALLY OLD GUY IS CHARMING,

08:13.367 --> 08:15.767
IN A "NEGLECTED PATIENT"
KIND OF WAY,

08:15.800 --> 08:18.600
MY NAME IS CHARLIE.

08:18.633 --> 08:20.733
CHARLIE YOST.

08:33.100 --> 08:34.733
HEY, I JUST HEARD.

08:34.767 --> 08:37.133
WELCOME BACK.
IS IT TRUE?
REALLY OLD GUY WOKE UP?

08:37.167 --> 08:38.533
HE HAS A NAME.

08:38.567 --> 08:41.467
THIS TIME TOMORROW, YOU CAN
CALL ME REALLY DEAD GUY.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.367
GUYS, I DON'T THINK
MR. YOST KNOWS WHO YOU ARE.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.500
SURE I DO. THAT'S MEREDITH.

08:45.533 --> 08:48.600
SHE AND THE BRAIN DOCTOR
ARE ALWAYS RUNNING HOT AND COLD.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.800
AND YOU'RE, UH, ALEX.

08:50.833 --> 08:53.067
YOU STILL GOT A THING FOR
THAT OLD PATIENT OF YOURS?

08:53.100 --> 08:56.133
I WAS SEMICOMATOSE, BLONDIE.

08:56.167 --> 08:57.733
I COULD STILL HEAR YOU GUYS.

08:57.767 --> 09:00.533
GET A C.T., A C.B.C.
AND CHEMISTRIES.

09:00.567 --> 09:02.100
YOUR KIDNEYS MAY BE
WORKING AGAIN,

09:02.133 --> 09:03.600
WHICH MAY BE
WHY YOU WOKE UP.

09:03.633 --> 09:05.300
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

09:05.333 --> 09:08.200
OH, IT JUST MEANS NOW I GOT
TWO THINGS TO DO TODAY,

09:08.233 --> 09:11.167
TAKE A PEE AND DIE.
NOBODY'S DYING. AHH.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.533
FUNCTIONAL MUSCLE TRANSFER.

09:13.567 --> 09:15.033
WHAT?
FOR CONNIE WILLIAMS.

09:15.067 --> 09:16.833
I WAS READING UP
ON GLOSSECTOMIES

09:16.867 --> 09:19.333
AND SAW THE PROCEDURE.

09:19.367 --> 09:21.167
WE COULD MICROSURGICALLY
REINNERVATE

09:21.200 --> 09:22.667
HER HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.667
A NERVE GRAFT?
IT'S TOO RISKY.

09:24.700 --> 09:26.600
A FREE FLAP'S
STILL YOUR BEST BET.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.533
OH, EVEN IF THAT GOES WELL,

09:28.567 --> 09:31.300
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
SHE'LL NEVER SPEAK THE SAME.

09:31.333 --> 09:33.667
THAT WOMAN LOVES TO TALK
MORE THAN ANYONE I KNOW.
WHAT'S A FUNCTIONAL
MUSCLE TRANSFER?

09:33.700 --> 09:35.600
YOU WON'T FIND IT
IN THE BOOKS, O'MALLEY.

09:35.633 --> 09:38.033
IT'S CUTTING-EDGE. YOU CONNECT
THE NERVES FROM THE LEG

09:38.067 --> 09:40.067
WITH THE NERVES
FROM THE TONGUE.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.267
GIVES HER A SHOT
AT REALLY SPEAKING.
IF IT WORKS.

09:42.300 --> 09:45.600
THEY'VE ONLY DONE
A HALF A DOZEN OF THEM.
BETTER THAN NONE.

09:45.633 --> 09:48.500
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA PUSH
THE ENVELOPE, SLOAN.
WHY?

09:48.533 --> 09:51.467
WHY IS IT BETTER TO DO A SURGERY
THAT NEITHER OF YOU HAVE DONE

09:51.500 --> 09:53.700
THAN TO DO A SURGERY
THAT YOU KNOW AT LEAST GIVES HER

09:53.733 --> 09:55.633
A CHANCE
TO HAVE A NORMAL LIFE?

09:55.667 --> 09:57.667
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO
THIS PROCEDURE?

10:00.100 --> 10:04.067
ARE YOU SAYING THAT WE'RE TOO
OLD TO LEARN NEW WAYS, O'MALLEY?

10:04.100 --> 10:07.633
NO.
ARE YOU SAYING WE'RE OLD DOGS
WHO CAN'T LEARN NEW TRICKS?

10:07.667 --> 10:09.133
NO, I JUST--

10:09.167 --> 10:11.500
WE'RE NOT OLD DOGS.
WE STILL GOT IT.

10:11.533 --> 10:13.400
OKAY.

10:13.433 --> 10:15.500
I DID DO
A FUNCTIONAL MUSCLE TRANSFER

10:15.533 --> 10:17.633
TO RESTORE
ELBOW FUNCTION ONCE.

10:17.667 --> 10:19.433
ELBOW, TONGUE--
THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE.

10:19.467 --> 10:22.200
COME ON. WHAT DO YOU SAY?
LET'S LIGHT THIS CANDLE.

10:22.233 --> 10:24.567
YES, SIR.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.500
AGE IS JUST A NUMBER,
O'MALLEY.

10:26.533 --> 10:29.533
OH, YES, SIR.
(elevator bell dings)

10:32.700 --> 10:35.433
I GOT KAREV DOWN
IN THE CLINIC ALL DAY.

10:35.467 --> 10:38.400
HOPE THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
NOPE. (sighs)

10:38.433 --> 10:40.467
I KNOW HOW YOU LIKE
TO BE TOLD THESE THINGS,

10:40.500 --> 10:42.667
SO I'M TELLING YOU.
THANK YOU.

10:42.700 --> 10:45.433
OH, HE TRIED TO DUMP
A NEW INTERN ON ME--KAREV.

10:45.467 --> 10:48.067
CLEARLY HE'S NOT INTERESTED
IN TEACHING.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.500
THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME KNOW.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.400
DO YOU EVER FEEL OLD?

11:02.433 --> 11:04.600
I'M YOUNG. I'M A FETUS.

11:04.633 --> 11:06.567
NAH, I MEAN YOU EVER FEEL
LIKE THERE'S GONNA BE A TIME

11:06.600 --> 11:08.433
WHEN NEW TECHNIQUES
PASS YOU BY?

11:08.467 --> 11:10.167
I'M A GENIUS
AND A SCHOLAR.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.367
SHUT UP.
MM-HMM.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.300
MEREDITH ISN'T TELLING
CRISTINA ABOUT US.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.133
AND, WELL,

11:17.167 --> 11:19.067
SHE TELLS CRISTINA
EVERYTHING.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.733
I THOUGHT YOU BROKE THAT OFF.
I MEANT TO.

11:21.767 --> 11:25.400
YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA WANT
TO GET BACK TOGETHER.

11:25.433 --> 11:26.733
NO.

11:26.767 --> 11:29.400
YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA
GROW UP AND GET ALL WHOLE

11:29.433 --> 11:31.133
AND... WANT A RELATIONSHIP.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.500
I DO NOT.

11:32.533 --> 11:34.200
YOU'RE A BAD LIAR.

11:34.233 --> 11:37.333
YOU'RE OLD.
I'M JUST GETTIN' STARTED,
MY FRIEND.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.633
(sighs deeply)

11:42.667 --> 11:44.700
HEY.

11:44.733 --> 11:46.233
YOU FEELING ANY BETTER?

11:46.267 --> 11:48.567
I HEARD YOU'RE ON THAT
HEMIGLOSSECTOMY.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.400
THE TONGUE SURGERY? YEAH.

11:50.433 --> 11:53.300
OH, HERE I AM STUCK IN THE PIT
WITH THOSE KNOW-NOTHING INTERNS.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.233
YOU'D THINK EVENTUALLY
I'D CATCH A BREAK.

11:55.267 --> 11:56.700
CRISTINA...

11:56.733 --> 11:59.467
ARE WE EVER GONNA TALK
ABOUT THIS, THE BURKE THING?

11:59.500 --> 12:01.800
I'M NOT IZZIE.

12:01.833 --> 12:04.700
I'M NOT GONNA LIE
ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR ALL DAY.

12:04.733 --> 12:07.733
I'M GONNA LIE HERE
ON THE COUNTER.

12:10.267 --> 12:13.467
I'LL TRADE YOU
THE HEMIGLOSSECTOMY.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.500
WHAT?

12:14.533 --> 12:16.033
YOU TAKE THE HEMIGLOSSECTOMY,

12:16.067 --> 12:18.400
AND I WILL TAKE THE E.R.
AND YOUR INTERNS.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.167
ARE YOU SURE?

12:20.200 --> 12:22.300
TAKE THE SURGERY
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.067
YOU'RE STARTING
TO FREAK ME OUT.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.167
OH.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.667
(chuckles)

12:27.700 --> 12:30.567
I SAW THE WHOLE THING, YANG.
YOU CAN STOP PRETENDING.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.467
OH, I'M NOT PRETENDING.
I'M SAD. I'M VERY SAD.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.667
(childish voice)
ME SO SAD.
MAYBE I SHOULD TRY IT,

12:35.700 --> 12:38.300
SEE IF I CAN GET GREY
TO TAKE MY NEW INTERN.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.500
(normal voice) NO.
HEY, FORGET IT. SAD IS MINE.

12:40.533 --> 12:43.500
GO FIND
YOUR OWN PRETEND EMOTION.

12:43.533 --> 12:47.267
BLONDIE!

12:47.300 --> 12:50.033
HEY, BLONDIE.

12:50.067 --> 12:51.800
CHARLIE...

12:51.833 --> 12:53.733
I HAVE A MILLION CHARTS
TO UPDATE.

12:53.767 --> 12:55.133
I'M BUSY.

12:55.167 --> 12:56.733
I WANT LOBSTER.
WHAT?

12:56.767 --> 12:59.733
FOR MY LAST MEAL.
IT'S TRADITIONAL.

12:59.767 --> 13:02.433
THE DYING MAN GETS TO CHOOSE
WHAT HE WANTS TO EAT.

13:02.467 --> 13:05.333
I WANT LOBSTER.
I'M NOT GETTING YOU LOBSTER
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT DYING.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.767
I WON'T ALLOW IT.

13:06.800 --> 13:10.033
A MAN CAN ONLY HANG ON
FOR SO LONG, BLONDIE.

13:10.067 --> 13:12.167
AFTER A WHILE,
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.

13:12.200 --> 13:15.233
(panting)

13:16.733 --> 13:19.767
(sighs) DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY FRIENDS, FAMILY, ANYONE?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.700
THEY'RE ALL DEAD
OR ON THEIR WAY TO DEAD.

13:22.733 --> 13:24.667
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND SOMEDAY

13:24.700 --> 13:26.700
WHEN YOU'RE OLDER,
LESS NAIVE.

13:26.733 --> 13:28.733
I'M NOT NAIVE.

13:28.767 --> 13:32.167
YOU AND WHAT'S HIS FACE,
THAT'S NOT NAIVE?

13:32.200 --> 13:34.100
(scoffs) I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE--

13:34.133 --> 13:37.033
WE'RE NOT--HE'S NOT--YOU KNOW
ABOUT WHAT'S HIS FACE?

13:37.067 --> 13:40.100
I KNOW YOU'RE CRAZY IF YOU
THINK HE'S LEAVING HIS WIFE.

13:40.133 --> 13:43.633
GUYS ALWAYS SAY THAT.
WELL, NOT THAT IT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS,

13:43.667 --> 13:47.233
BUT THIS IS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
I'M SURE IT'S TRUE LOVE.
I'M SURE HE'S TOLD HIS WIFE.

13:47.267 --> 13:49.433
I'M SURE HE'S MOVED OUT.

13:49.467 --> 13:52.233
AND I'M SURE
ALL YOUR FRIENDS KNOW, RIGHT?

13:52.267 --> 13:53.467
YEAH.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.367
BY THE WAY,
I WANT REAL LOBSTER,

13:56.400 --> 13:59.133
NOT THAT FAKE WHITEFISH CRAP.

14:01.833 --> 14:03.733
HEY, I'M FILLING IN
FOR CRISTINA.

14:03.767 --> 14:05.100
SO HOW'S IT GOING?

14:05.133 --> 14:07.600
I PULLED A SPLINTER
OUT OF A GUY'S TOE,

14:07.633 --> 14:09.600
AND NOW I'M WRITING
ABOUT IT.

14:09.633 --> 14:11.533
OKAY. WELL, IF YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS--

14:11.567 --> 14:14.567
I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS,
JUST NOT ABOUT A SPLINTER.

14:14.600 --> 14:18.233
OKAY.
OKAY.

14:18.267 --> 14:21.233
40-YEAR-OLD UNRESTRAINED DRIVER
IN A ROLLOVER M.V.C.
(Meredith) TRAUMA ONE.

14:21.267 --> 14:24.200
LOST VITALS ON THE SCENE,
AND WE WERE UNABLE TO INTUBATE.

14:24.233 --> 14:26.800
LEXIE, LET'S GO.
OPEN THE INTUBATION TRAY.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.267
HOW LONG'S HE BEEN DOWN?
TOOK TEN MINUTES TO LOAD HIM,

14:29.300 --> 14:31.600
14 TO GET HERE, SO 24.
PUSH ANOTHER EPI.

14:31.633 --> 14:33.633
YOU KNOW HOW TO INTUBATE?
UH, I'VE NEVER DONE IT.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.667
BUT YOU'VE SEEN IT DONE?
YEAH, A COUPLE OF TIMES.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.667
OKAY, COME DO ONE NOW.
ARE YOU SURE?

14:37.700 --> 14:40.600
VISUALIZE THE CORDS,
PULL STRAIGHT UP,

14:40.633 --> 14:42.033
WATCH THE TUBE
GO THROUGH THE CORDS.

14:42.067 --> 14:45.667
I-I-I CAN'T SEE THE CORDS.
YOU SHOULD DO THIS.
OKAY, YOU CAN DO IT.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.233
JUST DON'T ROCK UP
AGAINST THE TEETH.

14:48.267 --> 14:50.767
JUST PULL STRAIGHT UP.
(woman) PULSE OX
IS DOWN TO 86.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.100
(monitor beeping erratically)

15:02.333 --> 15:04.133
IT WASN'T BAD.

15:04.167 --> 15:05.067
WHAT?

15:05.100 --> 15:07.667
THAT WASN'T BAD
FOR YOUR FIRST INTUBATION.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.300
IS THAT SOME KIND OF JOKE?
THE GUY IS DEAD.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.533
HE DIED.
HE WAS DEAD
WHEN HE CAME IN HERE.

15:12.567 --> 15:14.767
HE WAS DEAD ON THE SCENE.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.333
HE WAS DEAD FOR 15 MINUTES
IN THE AMBULANCE.

15:17.367 --> 15:19.833
HE WAS DEAD BEFORE
I ASKED YOU TO INTUBATE.

15:19.867 --> 15:22.500
YOU'RE PRETTY CAVALIER,
DON'T YOU THINK?

15:22.533 --> 15:24.800
I MEAN, THEY BROUGHT HIM HERE
FOR HELP.

15:24.833 --> 15:28.133
THEY BROUGHT HIM HERE BECAUSE
THEY'RE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO.

15:28.167 --> 15:31.433
AND I HAD YOU INTUBATE BECAUSE
I'M REQUIRED TO TEACH YOU,

15:31.467 --> 15:33.367
AND THAT IS HOW YOU LEARN.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.367
NO. NO, YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE
EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.600
THAT WAS EVERYTHING I COULD.

15:38.633 --> 15:41.133
WELL, WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR
ARE YOU?

15:41.167 --> 15:43.200
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

15:45.800 --> 15:48.100
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LEARN
FROM ME, THAT'S FINE.

15:48.133 --> 15:50.033
BUT I HAVE TO
COVER THE PIT TODAY.

15:50.067 --> 15:52.567
SO WHY DON'T YOU DO BOTH OF US
A FAVOR AND GO HELP BAILEY

15:52.600 --> 15:53.767
IN THE CLINIC?
FINE.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.700
FINE.

15:57.667 --> 16:00.267
PRETEND I'M NOT HERE.

16:00.300 --> 16:03.133
PRETEND I'M NOT BUSTING IN
ON YOU AND PICTURES OF...

16:03.167 --> 16:04.367
REALLY DISTURBING TONGUES.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.300
BUT REALLY OLD GUY
IS GIVING ME A HARD TIME.

16:06.333 --> 16:09.300
I LIKED HIM SO MUCH BETTER WHEN
HE WAS SLEEPING, WHICH HE'S NOT.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.300
HE'S AWAKE.
YOU'VE PROBABLY ALREADY HEARD.
MM-HMM.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.233
BUT MY POINT IS,
IS THAT HE'S STUBBORN.

16:13.267 --> 16:15.800
HE'S STUBBORN AND REALLY OLD,
AND HE'S TELLING ME I'M AN IDIOT

16:15.833 --> 16:17.733
FOR THINKING
YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE CALLIE.

16:17.767 --> 16:20.433
(scoffs) SERIOUSLY?
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.

16:20.467 --> 16:23.367
YOU'RE GONNA
TELL HER TONIGHT, RIGHT?

16:23.400 --> 16:24.600
GEORGE?

16:24.633 --> 16:26.800
I-I-I HAVE TO GET
THIS RESEARCH DONE.

16:26.833 --> 16:29.200
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL HER.
(slams book)

16:29.233 --> 16:30.600
WASN'T IT JUST YESTERDAY

16:30.633 --> 16:32.833
WHEN YOU SAID THAT
YOU DIDN'T WANT ME TO TELL HER?

16:32.867 --> 16:34.367
FINE! FORGET IT.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.667
JUST PLAY WITH YOUR
STUPID PICTURES OF TONGUES.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.700
WE GOT THE TOX SCREEN BACK,
MRS. CHAPMAN.

16:39.733 --> 16:41.267
YOUR SON'S NOT ON DRUGS.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.433
YOU'RE SURE?
THERE'S NO DRUGS IN HIS SYSTEM?

16:44.467 --> 16:46.533
NO, CAME BACK CLEAN.
YOUR SON IS FINE.

16:46.567 --> 16:48.733
THIS IS NOT MY SON,
DR. SHALES.

16:48.767 --> 16:51.633
IT'S... NOT.
MAYBE WE SHOULD ORDER
SOME MORE TESTS.

16:51.667 --> 16:54.267
YOU KNOW, HE'S A TEENAGER.
I'VE RAISED FOUR OF 'EM MYSELF.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.200
TEENAGERS DON'T LIKE
TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK,

16:56.233 --> 16:58.767
THEY TALK BACK
TO THEIR PARENTS,

16:58.800 --> 17:01.133
AND THEY NEVER
COME OUT OF THEIR ROOMS.
YOU HAVE APPLE HAIR.

17:01.167 --> 17:03.567
I THREW A PANCAKE
IN THE RIVER,

17:03.600 --> 17:06.100
A-A PANCAKE!
(Mrs. Chapman) HUNTER...

17:06.133 --> 17:08.433
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

17:08.467 --> 17:10.567
I'M--I'M NOT SURE.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.500
DID YOU MEAN TO SAY IT?

17:12.533 --> 17:15.767
NO, I-I WAS TRYING TO SAY
THAT I WANTED TO GO HOME.

17:15.800 --> 17:19.033
OH, MY GOD.
YEAH, WE NEED TO DO
A FULL NEURO EXAM.

17:19.067 --> 17:21.100
ORDER A HEAD C.T.
AND LABS, NOW.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.767
(exhales)

17:23.800 --> 17:25.633
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,
YOU KNOW?

17:25.667 --> 17:27.567
IT IS.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.500
DO YOU THINK SO?
DR. SLOAN'S GONNA DO
THIS FANCY NEW SURGERY.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.633
MAYBE YOU'LL MAKE IT
INTO THE MEDICAL JOURNALS.

17:32.667 --> 17:35.367
MAYBE BE FAMOUS.
(women laugh)

17:35.400 --> 17:37.600
WHAT IF THE SURGERY
DOESN'T WORK?
(women) OH.

17:37.633 --> 17:41.067
WHAT IF THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE
TO TALK? (sniffles)

17:41.100 --> 17:44.067
I STILL HAVE SO MUCH TO SAY.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.567
SAY IT NOW, CONNIE.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.200
DON'T BE SO MORBID.
THE SURGERY WILL WORK.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.600
YOU'LL BE FINE.
(whispers) SHE SHOULD SAY IT
ALL NOW, JO, JUST IN CASE.

17:51.633 --> 17:54.533
OH.
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE
ANY MORE REGRETS.

17:54.567 --> 17:57.600
(normal voice) YOU CAN
TELL US ANYTHING, CONNIE.

17:57.633 --> 17:59.500
WE'RE YOUR BEST FRIENDS.

18:04.700 --> 18:07.533
YOU SHOULD TELL THEM.

18:07.567 --> 18:09.467
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T MEAN TO PRY.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.433
BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU
WANT TO SAY, YOU SHOULD SAY IT.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.100
I'VE BEEN HERE A WHILE.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.300
I'VE BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH
TO KNOW THAT THINGS

18:16.333 --> 18:18.633
DON'T ALWAYS GO
THE WAY THAT YOU WANT THEM TO,

18:18.667 --> 18:21.367
AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU
WANT TO SAY, YOU SHOULD SAY IT.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.067
JOANNE, YOU'VE GOTTA STOP
WEARING THOSE PANTS.
WHAT?

18:23.100 --> 18:25.667
THOSE PANTS MAKE YOUR ASS
LOOK LIKE TWO PUPPIES

18:25.700 --> 18:28.167
ARE STRUGGLING TO GET OUT.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

18:28.200 --> 18:30.467
ALL OF YOUR PANTS
ARE TOO TIGHT.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.567
YOU HAVE TO BUY SOME NEW PANTS.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.300
AND, ELAINE,
YOUR BREATH IS GOD-AWFUL.
MY BREATH?

18:35.333 --> 18:37.233
I MEAN, YOU NEED TO SEE
A DOCTOR OR SOMETHING

18:37.267 --> 18:39.333
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE
GOOD HYGIENE,

18:39.367 --> 18:41.667
BUT SWEET GOD,
YOUR BREATH IS BAD.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.100
AND YOU'VE GOT TO GET
A NEW HAIRDO.

18:44.133 --> 18:46.567
THE '80s ARE OVER, HONEY.

18:49.833 --> 18:51.733
WHAT NOW?
HE KEEPS PULLING OFF
HIS MONITOR LEADS.

18:51.767 --> 18:54.100
I TOLD HIM HE CAN
PULL 'EM OFF ALL DAY,

18:54.133 --> 18:56.400
HE'S STILL NOT GONNA DIE.
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF WAITING.

18:56.433 --> 18:58.767
YEAH? WELL, I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF COMING TO YOUR ROOM

18:58.800 --> 19:00.067
EVERY FIVE MINUTES.
SORRY, BLONDIE.

19:00.100 --> 19:03.567
IT'S TIME I TOOK THINGS
INTO MY OWN HANDS.
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:03.600 --> 19:06.167
YOU WANT TO DIE? FINE.
HERE. LET ME HELP YOU.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.133
YOU MISSED THIS ONE.
DAMN. YOU'RE STILL WITH US.

19:09.167 --> 19:11.267
OH, WAIT.
THIS LOOKS PROMISING.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.767
A NICE, THICK WIRE.
HOW'S THAT? ANY LUCK? NO?

19:13.800 --> 19:16.300
OH. WELL, NO WONDER. THAT'S WHY.
IT'S ATTACHED TO THIS LAMP.

19:16.333 --> 19:19.067
(laughs) OKAY. WELL,
LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE WE GOT.
(choking)

19:19.100 --> 19:20.500
DR. STEVENS.
WHAT?

19:20.533 --> 19:22.733
DR. STEVENS,
HE'S NOT BREATHING.
WHAT?

19:22.767 --> 19:26.100
HE DOESN'T HAVE A PULSE.
HE'S IN CARDIAC ARREST.
OH, GOD. I SWEAR TO GOD,
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

19:26.133 --> 19:28.233
(alarm wailing)

19:28.267 --> 19:31.133
(man) CODE BLUE, FOURTH FLOOR.
CODE BLUE, FOURTH FLOOR.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.100
ARE THE EPI
AND ATROPINE IN?

19:35.133 --> 19:38.167
(man) EPI'S IN.
I'M PUSHING ATROPINE NOW.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.800
HOLD C.P.R.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
LOOKS LIKE V-FIB.

19:40.833 --> 19:43.667
CHARGE THE PADDLES, 300.
(buzzing)

19:43.700 --> 19:45.367
CLEAR.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.600
(Tyler) NO CHANGE.

19:46.633 --> 19:49.567
CHARGE AGAIN. CLEAR.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.533
I'VE GOT A PULSE.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.500
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

19:53.533 --> 19:55.200
CHARLIE?

19:55.233 --> 19:56.200
(gasps)

19:56.233 --> 19:57.833
CHARLIE?

19:57.867 --> 20:00.233
(gasps)

20:00.267 --> 20:03.167
STOP SAVING MY LIFE.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.600
(Connie) I CAN'T BELIEVE
I SAID ALL THAT.

20:08.633 --> 20:11.333
DO YOU BELIEVE
I SAID ALL THAT?
NOT REALLY, NO.

20:11.367 --> 20:13.267
YOU THINK I HURT
THEIR FEELINGS?

20:13.300 --> 20:15.200
I MEAN,
REAL BAD HURT THEIR FEELINGS?

20:15.233 --> 20:18.400
YOU THINK THEY'LL FORGIVE ME?

20:18.433 --> 20:20.667
YOU TOLD ME.
YOU TOLD ME TO TELL THEM.

20:20.700 --> 20:24.167
YOU TOLD ME TO SAY EVERYTHING.
YOU SAID IT WOULD BE OKAY.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.267
I'M REALLY SORRY.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.600
DR. BAILEY,

20:31.633 --> 20:33.767
DR. GREY SENT ME DOWN HERE
TO WORK WITH YOU.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.133
OH, SHE DID, DID SHE?
AND WHY IS THAT?

20:36.167 --> 20:39.467
TRUTHFULLY? UH, SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO WORK WITH ME ANYMORE.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.033
SHE KICKED ME OUT.

20:41.067 --> 20:43.267
YOU CAN GO AND TELL DR. GREY

20:43.300 --> 20:46.233
THAT THE CLINIC IS NOT
A DUMPING GROUND FOR STRAYS.

20:46.267 --> 20:48.467
WE ARE NOT THE ISLAND
OF BROKEN INTERNS.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.567
PLEASE GO TELL HER THAT.

20:55.367 --> 20:57.300
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
DO THAT.

20:57.333 --> 20:59.600
I-I CAN'T WORK WITH HER,
WITH MEREDITH GREY.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.100
I-I-I CAN'T WORK WITH HER
BECAUSE I CAN'T LOOK AT HER.

21:02.133 --> 21:04.367
'CAUSE SHE HATES ME,
SHE HATES MY DAD,

21:04.400 --> 21:07.233
SHE OBVIOUSLY HATED MY MOTHER,
AND I AM...

21:07.267 --> 21:09.167
PLEASE JUST--JUST LET ME
WORK DOWN HERE TODAY.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.167
PLEASE, DR. BAILEY.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.667
KID IN CURTAIN THREE
NEEDS STITCHES. GO.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.600
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU GOT,
KAREV?
A TEENAGER CAME IN...

21:20.633 --> 21:22.467
HI.
THE CLINIC THIS MORNING,

21:22.500 --> 21:24.400
HE WAS LETHARGIC, IRRITABLE,
DYSPHASIC.
RIGHT.

21:24.433 --> 21:27.200
I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW YOU.
UH, NORMAN SHALES,
UP FROM U.C.L.A.

21:27.233 --> 21:30.200
ARE YOU NEURO? I THOUGHT I KNEW
ALL THE NEURO GUYS DOWN THERE.

21:30.233 --> 21:32.233
NORMAN'S AN INTERN,
DR. SHEPHERD.
OH.

21:32.267 --> 21:34.667
MY INTERN.
WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.600
THANK YOU.
GOOD.
OKAY, WHAT DO WE GOT?

21:36.633 --> 21:40.433
OH, LOOK AT THIS.
KID'S GOT HYDROCEPHALUS.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.367
IT'S PUSHING UP AGAINST
HIS BROCA'S AREA.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.433
YEAH, WHICH EXPLAINS
THE SCREWED UP SPEECH.
MM-HMM.

21:44.467 --> 21:45.667
I WAS SURE IT WAS DRUGS.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.633
WELL, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU'RE--

21:47.667 --> 21:49.200
YOU'RE A PHARMACIST
FOR 30 YEARS.

21:49.233 --> 21:51.133
YOU'RE SURE THAT EVERYBODY'S
HOOKED ON PILLS OR REEFER.

21:51.167 --> 21:54.033
RIGHT.
I WON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.
NO, SIRREE.

21:54.067 --> 21:55.200
RIGHT. OKAY.

21:55.233 --> 21:58.300
UM, WE NEED TO PUT IN
A SHUNT.
YEAH, SCHEDULE AN O.R.,

21:58.333 --> 22:01.267
THEN WE'LL GO TALK
TO HUNTER AND HIS MOM.
WILL DO, CAPTAIN.

22:02.733 --> 22:04.800
GUY DOESN'T KNOW
WHEN TO SHUT UP.

22:04.833 --> 22:08.267
HE DOES IT
WITH THE PATIENTS, TOO.
WELL, YOU'RE HIS RESIDENT.

22:08.300 --> 22:11.133
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT IT'D BE
LIKE YELLING AT MY GRANDFATHER.
OH.

22:11.167 --> 22:12.367
HEY.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.433
I HEARD ABOUT
REALLY OLD GUY.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.033
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

22:16.067 --> 22:17.800
COULDN'T FIND
HIS LVAD WIRE?

22:17.833 --> 22:21.100
IT WAS A COINCIDENCE,
AND HE'S STILL ALIVE.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.167
WELL, HAVE FUN
WITH REALLY OLD GUY.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.033
I'M OFF TO DO MEREDITH'S...

22:25.067 --> 22:26.800
HEMIGLOSSECTOMY.

22:26.833 --> 22:29.333
(laughs)

22:29.367 --> 22:33.667
OH, HEY. HEY, HAS GEORGE
SAID ANYTHING TO YOU--
SHE'S FAKING.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.600
SHE'S FAKING SADNESS,
PRETENDING TO BE SAD

22:35.633 --> 22:37.333
TO STEAL MY SURGERIES.

22:37.367 --> 22:40.333
OKAY, I HAVE A REALLY OLD GUY
TRYING TO KILL HIMSELF

22:40.367 --> 22:42.767
AND PROBLEMS OF MY OWN.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.800
SO I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THE TWO OF YOU

22:45.833 --> 22:47.333
AND YOUR FAKE DRAMA.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.600
A PERSON WANTS TO DIE,

22:54.633 --> 22:56.500
YOU LET THEM.

22:56.533 --> 22:57.733
IT'S POLITE.

22:57.767 --> 23:00.633
NOT IN A HOSPITAL, IT'S NOT.
IN A HOSPITAL, IT'S A LAWSUIT.

23:00.667 --> 23:03.500
I DON'T LIKE YOU.
REALLY? 'CAUSE I THOUGHT
WE WERE B.F.F.s.

23:03.533 --> 23:05.433
YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:05.467 --> 23:09.333
JUST FOR THAT,
I'M DYING RIGHT NOW.

23:09.367 --> 23:11.267
(groans)

23:11.300 --> 23:12.700
(grunts)

23:12.733 --> 23:15.433
THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU POOP
YOUR PANTS,

23:15.467 --> 23:17.367
BUT IT'S NOT
GONNA MAKE YOU DIE.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.467
(grunts) OH, DAMN IT.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.233
(sighs)

23:21.267 --> 23:24.033
YOU REALLY THINK HE'S NOT
GONNA LEAVE HIS WIFE?

23:24.067 --> 23:26.800
I THINK IF A PERSON
WANTS TO DO SOMETHING,

23:26.833 --> 23:28.333
LIKE DIE,

23:28.367 --> 23:31.300
THEY DO IT.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.100
OH.

23:37.733 --> 23:40.567
MAYBE I'M WRONG.
MAYBE THERE'S HOPE.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.333
MAYBE HE'LL TELL HER,

23:42.367 --> 23:44.600
AND YOU TWO WILL GET TOGETHER

23:44.633 --> 23:46.533
AND END UP HAPPY.

23:46.567 --> 23:48.200
YOU THINK?

23:48.233 --> 23:50.433
NOT THAT I'LL BE ALIVE
TO SEE IT.

23:50.467 --> 23:54.033
YOU'RE NOT DYING, CHARLIE.
NOT ON MY WATCH.

23:54.067 --> 23:55.700
DEAD MAN WALKING.

23:55.733 --> 23:58.633
I DON'T SEE MUCH WALKING,
CHARLIE.
(elevator bell dings)

24:00.633 --> 24:03.133
UH, YOU KNOW YANG AND GREY
ARE PLAYING MUSICAL CHAIRS

24:03.167 --> 24:04.633
WITH THEIR INTERNS?

24:04.667 --> 24:06.033
OH?

24:06.067 --> 24:08.733
I MEAN, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU,

24:08.767 --> 24:11.167
SEEING AS HOW
ONE OF YANG'S INTERNS

24:11.200 --> 24:14.067
IS ACTUALLY
ONE OF GREY'S RELATIVES...

24:14.100 --> 24:18.700
AND THE TWO GREYS ARE HAVING
SOME KIND OF FAMILY FEUD.

24:18.733 --> 24:20.200
I'M JUST SAYING,

24:20.233 --> 24:23.167
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE BEST
IF THE RESIDENTS

24:23.200 --> 24:25.200
STUCK WITH THEIR OWN INTERNS
IN THE FUTURE.

24:25.233 --> 24:27.200
YEAH. I GOT IT. THANKS.

24:29.333 --> 24:32.200
YOU PLAN TO HIDE OUT
IN HERE ALL DAY LONG,

24:32.233 --> 24:34.467
OR YOU PLAN TO EMERGE
AT SOME POINT AND DO YOUR JOB?

24:34.500 --> 24:36.533
WHY WOULD I COME OUT THERE
TO DO MY JOB

24:36.567 --> 24:38.567
WHEN YOU CLEARLY DO IT
SO MUCH BETTER?

24:38.600 --> 24:40.233
I'M DOING PAPERWORK, MIRANDA,

24:40.267 --> 24:43.333
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE FIGHT IN ME.

24:43.367 --> 24:46.233
I-I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT YOU.
I DON'T FIGHT MY...

24:46.267 --> 24:48.167
I-I DON'T--I DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT TODAY.

24:48.200 --> 24:51.133
SO... I'M DOING PAPERWORK.
OKAY?

25:03.533 --> 25:05.433
(door closes)

25:05.467 --> 25:07.367
(Mark) THE GRAFT'S
A PERFECT FIT.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.533
YEAH. IT'S GOT
GOOD VASCULARIZATION.
AND AT THIS RATE,

25:09.567 --> 25:12.533
YOU MAY ACTUALLY GET TO GO
ON THAT DATE WITH ADELE.
YEAH, I BETTER.

25:12.567 --> 25:14.467
CAN'T VERY WELL
HAVE HER TAKE ME BACK

25:14.500 --> 25:16.667
IF I CANCEL OUR FIRST DATE.

25:16.700 --> 25:19.533
WHERE YOU TAKING HER, CHIEF?
OH, THERE'S A NICE LITTLE
CHINESE RESTAURANT

25:19.567 --> 25:22.200
WE LIKE TO GO TO.

25:22.233 --> 25:24.200
HMM.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.533
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

25:27.567 --> 25:30.700
UM...

25:30.733 --> 25:33.600
DR. SLOAN, I DON'T--
I KNOW.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.133
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

25:35.167 --> 25:36.100
UM...

25:36.133 --> 25:37.667
(clears throat)

25:37.700 --> 25:38.833
WE'RE NOT SURE.

25:38.867 --> 25:40.767
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

25:40.800 --> 25:44.400
IT MEANS WE'VE NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE.

25:53.267 --> 25:56.267
WHAT ABOUT IF WE COAPT
THE LINGUAL NERVE

25:56.300 --> 25:58.667
UNDERNEATH HERE?
NO, WE'D END UP LOSING
THE VASCULAR SUPPLY.

25:58.700 --> 26:01.167
THE GRAFT
MIGHT NOT WORK AT ALL.

26:01.200 --> 26:04.767
SHE LIKES TO TALK, SLOAN.
SHE LIKES TO TALK A LOT.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.667
WE NEED AN EXTRA SET
OF HANDS.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.667
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS NERVES.

26:09.700 --> 26:12.300
O'MALLEY, GET DR. SHEPHERD.

26:12.333 --> 26:13.567
YES, SIR.

26:15.467 --> 26:18.100
A FUNCTIONAL MUSCLE TRANSFER
OF THE TONGUE?

26:18.133 --> 26:20.833
IT WAS LOOKING GOOD
FOR A WHILE, BUT, UM--
(sighs)

26:20.867 --> 26:22.200
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

26:22.233 --> 26:23.800
YEAH.

26:26.267 --> 26:27.200
IZZIE--

26:27.233 --> 26:29.633
WHAT?

26:29.667 --> 26:31.300
WHAT IS THERE TO SAY,
GEORGE?

26:31.333 --> 26:32.800
I'M A BLONDIE.

26:32.833 --> 26:36.200
I'M THE OTHER WOMAN.
I'M A BAD '50s CLICHé.

26:36.233 --> 26:37.467
NO, NO, NO.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.767
WE'RE NOT IN THIS TOGETHER.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.400
WOW. GREAT.

26:43.433 --> 26:45.700
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME KNOW.

26:45.733 --> 26:47.800
HEY, NO, NO. NO.
YOU DON'T GET TO BE MAD HERE.

26:47.833 --> 26:50.567
SERIOUSLY? WE SAID--
NO, NO, NO, NO.
THERE IS NO "WE."

26:50.600 --> 26:53.467
IT'S JUST ME. I'M THE ONE
WHO HAS TO TELL CALLIE.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.400
I'M THE ONE
WHO HAS TO DESTROY HER.

26:55.433 --> 26:58.333
THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU AND ME.
THIS IS ABOUT HER AND ME.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.267
I'M ENDING A MARRIAGE
TO A WONDERFUL WOMAN.

27:00.300 --> 27:02.033
ME. I'M THE ONE.

27:02.067 --> 27:04.800
IT'S NOT YOU.

27:04.833 --> 27:07.267
YOU...

27:07.300 --> 27:09.200
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU JUST BLURT OUT.

27:09.233 --> 27:10.467
IT'S NOT.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.767
I'LL DO IT.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.733
I WILL DO IT.

27:17.767 --> 27:21.633
YOU HAVE TO BACK OFF
AND LET ME DO IT.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.033
I'M SORRY.

27:27.067 --> 27:30.133
YOU TRADED... A HEMIGLOSSECTOMY
FOR THE PIT?

27:30.167 --> 27:31.333
IT'S A LONG STORY.

27:31.367 --> 27:33.133
A LONG STORY THAT ENDS

27:33.167 --> 27:35.067
WITH YOU PAWNING OFF
LEXIE GREY ON ME?

27:35.100 --> 27:37.133
I HAD HER DO AN INTUBATION
ON A DEAD GUY.

27:37.167 --> 27:39.133
IT'S SOMETHING YOU USED TO
HAVE US DO ALL THE TIME.

27:39.167 --> 27:41.600
I WAS TRYING TO TEACH HER.
WHATEVER SHE TOLD YOU...

27:41.633 --> 27:43.533
SHE TOLD ME YOU HATE HER.

27:43.567 --> 27:45.533
I DON'T--
AND THAT YOU HATED
HER MOTHER...

27:45.567 --> 27:46.633
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

27:46.667 --> 27:49.400
HER MOTHER, WHO CAME TO YOU
WITH A CASE OF HICCUPS

27:49.433 --> 27:51.100
AND DIED IN OUR HOSPITAL.

27:51.133 --> 27:53.800
DO YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING
WITH THIS?
SHE'S NOT MY INTERN.

27:53.833 --> 27:56.833
NO, SHE'S YOUR SISTER,
AND YOU HAVEN'T HAD A KIND WORD

27:56.867 --> 27:58.767
TO SAY TO HER
SINCE SHE GOT HERE.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.633
AND YOU WERE
HER MOTHER'S DOCTOR.

28:00.667 --> 28:03.033
NOW WHAT IS SHE SUPPOSED
TO THINK?
(pager beeps)

28:03.067 --> 28:04.800
LOOK, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT,

28:04.833 --> 28:07.333
YOUR JOB IS TO HELP THAT GIRL
BE A BETTER DOCTOR.

28:07.367 --> 28:09.367
SO HELP HER.

28:09.400 --> 28:10.600
YOU PAGED ME?

28:10.633 --> 28:12.267
REALLY OLD GUY...
YEAH.

28:12.300 --> 28:14.200
HE'S CHECKED OUT A.M.A.
HE'S LEAVING THE HOSPITAL.

28:14.233 --> 28:16.133
WHAT? HE CAN'T LEAVE.
HE'S SICK.

28:16.167 --> 28:19.033
HE CAN BARELY WALK,
AND I GOT HIM LOBSTER.

28:19.067 --> 28:22.100
I GOT A 9-1-1.
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE COLLAPSED.

28:22.133 --> 28:24.833
HE STARTED TALKING
THAT NONSENSE TALK AND--
(Alex) HIS PUPIL'S BLOWN.

28:24.867 --> 28:26.600
HIS BRAIN'S STARTING
TO HERNIATE. PAGE SHEPHERD.

28:26.633 --> 28:30.433
NORMAN, TAKE OVER THE BAG.
WE GOTTA GET HIM UP ON THE BED.
(Mrs. Chapman) WHAT'S HAPPENING?

28:30.467 --> 28:32.367
COUNT OF THREE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.533
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MY SON?
SPINAL FLUID'S BACKING UP.

28:34.567 --> 28:36.333
IT'S PUTTING PRESSURE
ON HIS BRAIN.

28:36.367 --> 28:38.467
SHEPHERD'S NOT ANSWERING
HIS PAGE.
TRY IT AGAIN.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.100
WHAT DO I DO?

28:40.133 --> 28:43.033
UH, HYPERVENTILATION...

28:43.067 --> 28:44.167
MANNITOL...

28:44.200 --> 28:46.367
I DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING. GO.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.067
GET SHEPHERD. GO.

28:48.100 --> 28:51.000
***

28:52.533 --> 28:55.700
DR. SHEPHERD.
I'M A LITTLE BUSY RIGHT NOW
MAKING MEDICAL HISTORY, KAREV.

28:55.733 --> 28:56.733
HUNTER CHAPMAN'S BRAIN
IS HERNIATING.

28:56.767 --> 28:58.467
HIS RIGHT PUPIL JUST BLEW.
OKAY, YOU NEED TO DO

28:58.500 --> 29:01.167
EXACTLY WHAT I SAY,
OR THAT KID'S GONNA BE DEAD

29:01.200 --> 29:02.567
IN THE NEXT TEN MINUTES.
CAN YOU DO THAT?

29:02.600 --> 29:05.233
YES, SIR.
OKAY, GET THE BIGGEST NEEDLE
YOU CAN FIND.

29:05.267 --> 29:06.500
***

29:06.533 --> 29:08.267
DR. KAREV, WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:08.300 --> 29:10.200
WHERE'S SHEPHERD?
DR. KAREV...

29:10.233 --> 29:12.300
I-I THINK IT MIGHT HELP
MRS. CHAPMAN--

29:12.333 --> 29:13.833
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET HER OUT OF HERE.

29:13.867 --> 29:16.167
WELL, SHE IS THE BOY'S MOM.
GET HER OUT OF HERE, NORMAN.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.667
GET HER OUT!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:17.700 --> 29:19.833
MRS. CHAPMAN,
HE'S TRYING TO HELP.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:19.867 --> 29:21.500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:21.533 --> 29:23.533
HOLD HIS HEAD.
SHEPHERD TOLD ME WHAT TO DO.

29:23.567 --> 29:26.600
***

29:28.267 --> 29:29.300
OKAY.

29:29.333 --> 29:33.267
***

29:39.533 --> 29:42.733
***

29:42.767 --> 29:44.567
(sighs)

29:44.600 --> 29:46.500
CHARLIE...

29:46.533 --> 29:47.733
YOU CAN'T GO.

29:47.767 --> 29:50.367
I KNOW THAT YOU THINK
YOUR LIFE IS OVER.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.833
I KNOW YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY.

29:52.867 --> 29:56.233
BUT YOUR LIFE'S NOT OVER
AND...

29:56.267 --> 29:58.233
AND YOU HAVE ME.

29:58.267 --> 30:00.167
YOU HAVE ME. I NEED YOU.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.100
I NEED SOMEBODY TO TALK TO.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.833
BECAUSE I THINK
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT BEFORE.

30:04.867 --> 30:07.733
I DON'T THINK GEORGE
IS GONNA LEAVE HIS WIFE.

30:07.767 --> 30:09.633
AND I NEED YOU
TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

30:09.667 --> 30:11.667
I-I NEED SOME...

30:11.700 --> 30:15.200
YOU CAN'T GO, CHARLIE.

30:15.233 --> 30:17.067
CHARLIE?

30:17.100 --> 30:20.100
***

30:26.533 --> 30:28.467
CHARLIE?

30:30.600 --> 30:33.600
***

30:38.367 --> 30:40.433
CRAP.

30:40.467 --> 30:43.600
***

30:51.567 --> 30:53.467
ALL THIS TIME,
HE WAS TELLING ME THE TRUTH.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.467
ONCE WE GET THE SHUNT IN,
ANY EXCESS SPINAL FLUID

30:55.500 --> 30:57.033
WILL DRAIN TO HIS ABDOMEN.

30:57.067 --> 30:59.767
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.
EXCUSE ME.

31:03.400 --> 31:06.233
(clears throat)

31:06.267 --> 31:08.500
I'M SORRY I UNLOADED
ON YOU, NORMAN.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.433
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS?
HEAT OF THE MOMENT.

31:10.467 --> 31:12.667
DON'T APOLOGIZE TO HIM.
WHAT?

31:12.700 --> 31:15.667
OH, DR. BAILEY'S RIGHT. IT--
SHUT UP, NORMAN.
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

31:15.700 --> 31:16.767
HE GOT IN YOUR WAY.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.767
HE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL DAY,
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS--

31:19.800 --> 31:22.800
WHEN AN INTERN GETS IN
THE WAY OF A RESIDENT--

31:22.833 --> 31:25.333
YOU'RE NOT DOING WHAT'S BEST
FOR YOUR PATIENT.

31:25.367 --> 31:27.667
NOW YOU ALMOST MISSED
DIAGNOSING THAT KID TODAY

31:27.700 --> 31:29.567
BECAUSE NORMAN HERE
THOUGHT IT WAS DRUGS.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.500
SO DON'T APOLOGIZE.
HE SHOULD BE YELLED AT.

31:31.533 --> 31:35.033
DR. BAILEY... (lowers voice)
HE'S AS OLD AS THE HILLS.
I DON'T CARE HOW OLD
HE IS, DR. KAREV.

31:35.067 --> 31:37.167
HE'S STILL AN INTERN,
AND INTERNS

31:37.200 --> 31:38.600
ARE BASICALLY TEENAGERS.

31:38.633 --> 31:40.533
WE ARE NOT HARD ON THEM
BECAUSE IT'S FUN.

31:40.567 --> 31:43.833
WE'RE HARD ON THEM BECAUSE
THIS IS A LIFE-AND-DEATH JOB.

31:43.867 --> 31:45.100
THEY NEED TO LEARN THAT.

31:45.133 --> 31:48.267
THERE IS A REASON WHY WE HAVE
A PECKING ORDER IN A HOSPITAL.

31:48.300 --> 31:50.333
IT SAVES LIVES.

31:55.067 --> 31:57.367
I THINK THAT WOMAN'S
GONNA BE ABLE TO TALK

31:57.400 --> 31:59.700
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE
THANKS TO US.

31:59.733 --> 32:02.200
I THINK I STILL GOT IT.
I THINK YOU DO, TOO.

32:02.233 --> 32:04.600
NOW WE JUST GOTTA FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA TELL ADELE.

32:04.633 --> 32:06.700
OH, MAN.
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.
YEAH.

32:06.733 --> 32:09.700
FIRST OFF, DON'T TELL HER
YOU WANT TO MOVE BACK IN.
NO?

32:09.733 --> 32:11.400
REEKS OF DESPERATION.

32:11.433 --> 32:12.700
IT'S A DEAL BREAKER.
TRUST ME.

32:12.733 --> 32:15.167
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.533
YOU GUYS
ARE KIDDING YOURSELVES.

32:16.567 --> 32:18.400
YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE
YOU IDIOTS CAME

32:18.433 --> 32:20.700
TO THAT WOMAN LOSING HER TONGUE,
TO HER NEVER SPEAKING AGAIN?

32:20.733 --> 32:23.233
OH, YEAH, YOU WERE A COUPLE
OF COWBOYS IN THERE,

32:23.267 --> 32:25.167
TELLING YOURSELVES
YOU CAN DO THIS,

32:25.200 --> 32:27.267
ACTING LIKE THE BIG BOYS.

32:27.300 --> 32:29.200
YOU HAD NO BUSINESS
DOING THAT SURGERY.

32:29.233 --> 32:31.033
(chuckles) NO BUSINESS.

32:31.067 --> 32:32.800
LUCKY I CAME IN WHEN I DID.

32:32.833 --> 32:35.033
SHAME ON YOU.
AND SHAME ON YOU.

32:35.067 --> 32:36.600
AS FOR ADELE,

32:36.633 --> 32:38.533
TELL HER YOU CAN'T
IMAGINE YOUR LIFE WITHOUT HER.

32:38.567 --> 32:40.833
TELL HER FOR THE LAST MONTH
YOU BEEN WALKING AROUND

32:40.867 --> 32:43.400
THIS HOSPITAL AT NIGHT
JUST THINKING ABOUT HER.

32:43.433 --> 32:45.367
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.800
I'M SORRY
I CALLED YOU AN IDIOT.

32:49.833 --> 32:51.233
HEY.

32:51.267 --> 32:54.133
SO I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE SAD,

32:54.167 --> 32:55.833
AND WHAT I CAN DO
TO HELP.

32:55.867 --> 32:57.533
OH, YOU HAVE ANOTHER SURGERY?

32:57.567 --> 33:00.433
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU NEED.
WELL, IT KIND OF IS.

33:00.467 --> 33:03.067
NO, WHAT YOU NEED IS ME
AND MY TIME.

33:03.100 --> 33:05.800
SO I THOUGHT WE COULD
GO BACK TO MY HOUSE

33:05.833 --> 33:07.733
AND GET INTO OUR PAJAMAS,

33:07.767 --> 33:09.667
JUST SIT AND TALK
ABOUT THIS WHOLE BURKE THING

33:09.700 --> 33:12.200
AND REALLY GET
TO THE ROOT OF YOUR FEELINGS.

33:12.233 --> 33:14.500
JUST TALK ALL NIGHT LONG
IF WE HAVE TO.

33:14.533 --> 33:16.200
TALK.

33:16.233 --> 33:19.067
TALK... AND CRY.

33:19.100 --> 33:21.767
CRY.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.467
YOU KNOW.

33:23.500 --> 33:26.433
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I KNOW,
SURGERY STEALER.

33:26.467 --> 33:28.233
SO, PERSON-WHO-IS-
SLEEPING-WITH-DEREK?

33:28.267 --> 33:30.100
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

33:30.133 --> 33:32.800
WHAT, YOU THINK I'M TOO FRAGILE
TO HANDLE YOUR SEX LIFE?

33:32.833 --> 33:35.233
WELL, HE DID LEAVE YOU
AT THE ALTAR.

33:35.267 --> 33:36.600
AND I'M YOUR PERSON.

33:36.633 --> 33:38.133
HOW, BY--BY "PROTECTING ME"?

33:38.167 --> 33:40.067
THAT'S NOW HOW TO BE
MY PERSON.

33:40.100 --> 33:43.167
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO.
YOU KNOW THAT.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.333
I'M DEALING. OKAY?
THE BEST I CAN.

33:46.367 --> 33:48.267
SO IF YOU NEED
TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE,

33:48.300 --> 33:51.100
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO
TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE ELSE.

33:51.133 --> 33:52.200
OKAY?

33:52.233 --> 33:54.133
FINE.
BUT YOU OWE ME A SURGERY.

33:54.167 --> 33:56.433
YEAH, WELL, YOU OWE ME
SEX DETAILS.

33:56.467 --> 33:59.267
ARE WE DOING THIS
OR NOT?

34:15.633 --> 34:19.033
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SAY?
WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE GUY.

34:19.067 --> 34:20.800
WE ATE LUNCH IN HERE
FOR A YEAR.

34:20.833 --> 34:25.300
THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS SAY
A FEW KIND WORDS ABOUT HIM.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.833
(mouths word)

34:30.867 --> 34:33.133
HE...

34:35.300 --> 34:37.467
HE DIDN'T SNORE TOO LOUD...

34:37.500 --> 34:39.367
LY.

34:42.500 --> 34:45.233
HE, UM...

34:45.267 --> 34:46.433
NEVER COMPLAINED.

34:46.467 --> 34:48.367
AND HE ALWAYS TOOK
HIS MEDS.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.200
HARDLY EVER FARTED.

34:50.233 --> 34:52.133
(Meredith) ALEX.

34:52.167 --> 34:54.667
FINE. UH, HE HAD
12 SURGERIES THIS YEAR,

34:54.700 --> 34:56.600
AND HE--HE LIVED THROUGH THEM.

34:56.633 --> 34:57.833
THAT'S--THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

34:57.867 --> 35:01.000
THANK YOU, ALEX.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.500
CRISTINA?

35:07.433 --> 35:09.500
UH, I GOT TO PRACTICE
STUFF ON HIM--

35:09.533 --> 35:11.700
CENTRAL LINES AND I.V.s--

35:11.733 --> 35:14.133
IT WAS GOOD PRACTICE.

35:14.167 --> 35:15.600
UM...

35:15.633 --> 35:19.633
CHARLIE, THE TRUTH IS...
YOU WERE A BASTARD.

35:19.667 --> 35:22.533
YOU WERE. YOU WERE MEAN
AND STUBBORN AND JUST...

35:22.567 --> 35:24.667
A BASTARD.

35:24.700 --> 35:28.567
BUT YOU WERE A BASTARD
WHO KNEW WHAT YOU WANTED.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.500
AND YOU STUCK TO YOUR GUNS

35:30.533 --> 35:32.800
AND PROVED THAT IF YOU WANT
SOMETHING BADLY ENOUGH,

35:32.833 --> 35:36.300
IF YOU'RE... DETERMINED ENOUGH
AND PATIENT ENOUGH,

35:36.333 --> 35:38.533
EVENTUALLY IT WILL HAPPEN.

35:38.567 --> 35:41.033
IT WILL.

35:41.067 --> 35:43.800
AND THAT GIVES ME HOPE, SO...

35:43.833 --> 35:46.800
THANKS FOR THAT.

35:46.833 --> 35:48.733
***

35:48.767 --> 35:51.467
BYE-BYE, CHARLIE.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.567
THE TRUTH IS PAINFUL...

35:53.600 --> 35:57.233
***

35:57.267 --> 35:59.367
IT WENT REALLY WELL.

35:59.400 --> 36:02.200
***

36:04.100 --> 36:06.133
YOUR FRIENDS, UH...

36:06.167 --> 36:09.033
I AM SO SORRY.
I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM.

36:09.067 --> 36:11.567
***

36:11.600 --> 36:14.300
HOW'D SHE DO?

36:14.333 --> 36:17.267
GREAT. SHE DID GREAT.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.233
SHE'S GONNA TALK AGAIN?
YEAH, THE CHANCES
ARE VERY GOOD.

36:20.267 --> 36:22.833
IN THAT CASE, WE HAVE
A FEW THINGS WE'D LIKE TO SAY.

36:22.867 --> 36:24.800
(clears throat)

36:24.833 --> 36:27.500
YOUR FIRST HUSBAND,
HE PUT HIS HAND ON MY ASS

36:27.533 --> 36:29.033
EVERY CHANCE HE GOT.

36:29.067 --> 36:30.033
AND YOUR SECOND HUSBAND,

36:30.067 --> 36:32.467
HE SPAT WHEN HE TALKED,
AND PLUS, HE WAS UGLY.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.267
WE KNOW THAT YOU THOUGHT
HE WAS HANDSOME,

36:34.300 --> 36:36.200
BUT THE MAN WAS A TROLL.

36:36.233 --> 36:38.667
AND THAT GUY YOU DATED
LAST YEAR, COMB-OVER GUY...
COMB-OVER GUY.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.200
OH, MY GOD...

36:40.233 --> 36:42.533
DEEP DOWN,
NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR IT,

36:42.567 --> 36:44.833
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HITS
CLOSE TO HOME.

36:44.867 --> 36:47.233
WHAT?

36:47.267 --> 36:49.767
I HAVE YOUR MOTHER'S
DEATH NOTE HERE.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.700
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
ON THE DAY SHE DIED

36:51.733 --> 36:53.167
IS IN HERE.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.100
AND I KNOW
BECAUSE I WROTE IT.

36:55.133 --> 36:58.433
SO I'D LIKE TO GO OVER IT
WITH YOU IF THAT'S OKAY.

36:58.467 --> 37:00.767
YEAH.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.700
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
LET ME JUST SAY

37:02.733 --> 37:06.533
THAT EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED THAT DAY--

37:06.567 --> 37:08.200
EVERY SETBACK--

37:08.233 --> 37:09.433
THERE WAS A 1% CHANCE

37:09.467 --> 37:11.800
OF EACH
OF THOSE THINGS HAPPENING.

37:11.833 --> 37:13.300
1%.

37:13.333 --> 37:17.167
AND YOUR MOTHER
WAS THE 1%, OKAY?

37:17.200 --> 37:20.033
***

37:20.067 --> 37:22.833
SHE CAME IN COMPLAINING
OF PERSISTENT HICCUPS.

37:22.867 --> 37:26.200
WE DID
AN ENDOSCOPIC FUNDOPLICATION.

37:26.233 --> 37:27.600
YOU DID IT ENDOSCOPICALLY?

37:27.633 --> 37:30.067
SO IT WOULD BE
AN OUTPATIENT PROCEDURE.

37:30.100 --> 37:33.767
WE WANTED TO AVOID
MAJOR SURGERY.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.600
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

37:35.633 --> 37:37.633
I WAS VERY FOND
OF YOUR MOTHER.

37:37.667 --> 37:39.567
SHE WAS...

37:39.600 --> 37:42.833
I... I WAS VERY FOND
OF HER.

37:42.867 --> 37:46.067
***

37:46.100 --> 37:50.500
SHE GOT
BACTERIAL ENDOCARDITIS...

37:50.533 --> 37:54.367
SOMETIMES WE TELL THE TRUTH...

37:54.400 --> 37:58.733
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS ALL
WE HAVE TO GIVE.

37:58.767 --> 38:00.667
***

38:00.700 --> 38:03.167
UH, I'VE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE

38:03.200 --> 38:05.833
WITH THIS WHOLE PECKING ORDER
OF THINGS.

38:05.867 --> 38:08.633
IT'S--
I'VE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE.

38:08.667 --> 38:10.567
'CAUSE I'M USED TO BEING
NUMBER ONE.

38:10.600 --> 38:13.200
BUT I'M NOT NUMBER ONE,
NOT ANYMORE.

38:13.233 --> 38:15.533
SO... THE BEST THAT
I CAN COME UP WITH

38:15.567 --> 38:19.267
IS TO BE NUMBER TWO--

38:19.300 --> 38:22.700
THE BEST DAMN NUMBER TWO
THIS HOSPITAL HAS EVER SEEN--

38:22.733 --> 38:25.200
BUT YOUR NUMBER TWO.

38:25.233 --> 38:27.667
I WILL...

38:27.700 --> 38:30.033
I WILL--
I WILL HELP YOU.

38:30.067 --> 38:33.033
WE'LL BE LIKE A TEAM.

38:33.067 --> 38:34.367
BECAUSE... (sighs)

38:34.400 --> 38:37.233
LOOK, GIRL, YOU JUST SEEM
TO BE HAVING A HARD TIME.

38:37.267 --> 38:40.133
(laughs)
AND, UH, I KNOW I'M HAVING
A HARD TIME,

38:40.167 --> 38:44.367
BUT TOGETHER, WE COULD...

38:44.400 --> 38:46.833
DO THIS.

38:46.867 --> 38:50.767
I JUST THINK
WE COULD DO THIS TOGETHER.

38:50.800 --> 38:53.133
***

38:53.167 --> 38:55.100
SOMETIMES WE TELL THE TRUTH
BECAUSE...

38:55.133 --> 38:58.533
WE NEED TO SAY IT OUT LOUD TO
REALLY HEAR IT FOR OURSELVES.

38:58.567 --> 39:00.467
***

39:00.500 --> 39:02.400
YOU GOT TO REATTACH
A WOMAN'S TONGUE.

39:02.433 --> 39:04.533
OH, I WAS THERE. I DIDN'T
ACTUALLY DO ANY REATTACHING.

39:04.567 --> 39:06.233
YEAH, BUT STILL,

39:06.267 --> 39:08.167
YOU'RE THE INTERN
THEY WANTED ON THAT CASE.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.133
HE'S A REPEATER.

39:10.167 --> 39:11.200
(man) WHAT?

39:11.233 --> 39:15.233
YOUR BIG HERO HERE,
HE WAS AN INTERN LAST YEAR.

39:15.267 --> 39:17.533
THAT'S WHY HE, UH,
KNOWS SOME OF THIS STUFF.

39:17.567 --> 39:19.733
HE'S ALREADY BEEN THROUGH IT.

39:19.767 --> 39:21.833
BUT IF YOU WANT TO LEARN
FROM SOMEONE--

39:21.867 --> 39:23.533
REALLY, REALLY LEARN--

39:23.567 --> 39:24.733
GO TO A RESIDENT,

39:24.767 --> 39:26.667
NOT THIS DUDE.

39:26.700 --> 39:30.367
***

39:32.433 --> 39:34.100
UH, HE'S RIGHT.

39:34.133 --> 39:37.167
IF YOU WANT TO EMULATE SOMEONE,
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT ME.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.700
I'M NOT THAT GUY.

39:38.733 --> 39:40.067
(elevator bell dings)

39:40.100 --> 39:42.833
AND SOMETIMES
WE TELL THE TRUTH...

39:42.867 --> 39:45.800
BECAUSE WE JUST CAN'T
HELP OURSELVES.

39:45.833 --> 39:48.267
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

39:48.300 --> 39:51.533
***

39:51.567 --> 39:54.367
INTERNS.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.300
***

39:56.333 --> 39:59.800
AND SOMETIMES...

39:59.833 --> 40:02.767
WE TELL THEM...

40:07.800 --> 40:12.400
BECAUSE WE OWE THEM
AT LEAST THAT MUCH.

40:13.633 --> 40:16.500
JUST SAY IT.

40:21.467 --> 40:23.067
I SLEPT WITH IZZIE.
