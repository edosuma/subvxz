WEBVTT

00:05.276 --> 00:08.645
Are we really
fighting over stolen eggs?

00:08.879 --> 00:11.082
Brr... I can't help myself.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.074

00:29.103 --> 00:31.568
It's hero time!

00:43.642 --> 00:47.011
Ben, there's a lot of
worried Vaxasaurian parents

00:47.046 --> 00:49.011
right now.
What are you doing?

00:49.046 --> 00:55.080
A sweet Ben 10
video that's about to go viral.

00:55.116 --> 00:57.449
Check it out.
Over the shoulder.

00:59.788 --> 01:01.820
Chicken dance!

01:04.824 --> 01:06.990
Ben, cool your jets!

01:07.026 --> 01:10.428
Don't toy with the villains.
Contain them!

01:12.400 --> 01:14.785
And even after all this time, wearing

01:14.786 --> 01:17.171
the most powerful weapon
in the universe ...

01:17.206 --> 01:21.043
And I still don't
understand the responsibility I have.

01:21.078 --> 01:23.979
This is the same lecture I've
heard since I was 10.

01:24.014 --> 01:27.415
They're bad, I'm good ...
the end.

01:27.451 --> 01:29.316
I'm getting a smoothy.

01:35.790 --> 01:38.693
Blukic, Driba, it's time.

01:38.728 --> 01:40.794
M-Mr. Smoothy.

01:42.431 --> 01:46.634
At last! We're finally gonna
find that elusive store 23!

01:46.670 --> 01:49.171
The very thought makes
me belch in anticipation!

01:50.541 --> 01:51.874
Me, too.

02:20.889 --> 02:24.793
Hmm. This could be a wild,
omnivoracious chase.

02:24.828 --> 02:28.229
The Mr. Smoothy's website makes
no mention of a 23rd store.

02:28.265 --> 02:29.898
No phone listing, either.

02:29.933 --> 02:32.634
But we've seen store 23
on your GPS.

02:32.669 --> 02:35.937
On and off, here and there,
and in different places.

02:35.973 --> 02:39.408
Perhaps we're after
a Mr. Smoothy roach coach.

02:40.444 --> 02:44.280
You're getting a call.
- Uh, let it go to voice mail.

02:45.984 --> 02:49.452
Just as I feared.
Only 22 Mr. Smoothys.

02:49.488 --> 02:51.922
No, there it is.
- What's the address?

02:51.957 --> 02:53.390
Whoops, it's gone again.

02:53.425 --> 02:58.295
No, I saw the cross streets.
Corner of Pugsley and Klein.

03:11.778 --> 03:16.047
It's gone!

03:18.485 --> 03:22.354
Clearly, this is no ordinary
Mr. Smoothy.

03:30.164 --> 03:33.631
Oh, pooh! Will nobody
come out to serve us?

03:33.667 --> 03:37.068
Sister, you just said
a mouthful of something.

03:37.103 --> 03:40.237
I'm out of here.

03:43.743 --> 03:46.777
That was a cross-dimensional
sunburst aurora.

03:46.812 --> 03:49.045
No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was!

03:49.081 --> 03:52.615
Not a sunburst.
More of a pinwheel shape.

03:52.651 --> 03:56.019
A pinwheel aurora?
That's worse!

04:00.059 --> 04:03.227
You ... oh, you infernal
contraption!

04:03.262 --> 04:06.597
Why must you fail during
business hours?!

04:06.632 --> 04:10.634
<i>Professor Hokestar?</i>

04:11.437 --> 04:12.870
Why, Ben Tennyson!

04:12.905 --> 04:16.339
[ chuckles ]
Welcome to my place of business!

04:16.375 --> 04:21.111
You opened a Mr. Smoothy
that moves from place to place?

04:21.147 --> 04:24.815
Wha-a-t?
No, no, no, no, my boy!

04:24.851 --> 04:27.918
Behold, and hopefully endorse,

04:27.953 --> 04:33.157
a Mr. Smoothy that exists
in every dimension at once...

04:33.193 --> 04:37.362
Just as soon as I get this
warp-field generator working!

04:37.398 --> 04:41.366
So it's a Mr. Smoothy
that moves from place to place.

04:41.401 --> 04:43.535
We're not moving between places.

04:43.570 --> 04:47.606
We're staying in one place while
rotating through different dimensions.

04:47.641 --> 04:50.876
This is a dimension-skipping
Mr. Smoothy.

04:52.046 --> 04:53.846
Not anymore it isn't.

04:53.882 --> 04:58.284
Now, let us discover just
where we have been stranded,

04:58.320 --> 05:02.155
and let us hope we have
the only smoothy joint.

05:05.192 --> 05:06.826
Looks like Bellwood.

05:06.861 --> 05:10.363
Look! There's even
an alien making trouble!

05:20.074 --> 05:22.541
Ben Tennyson!
- Right here, Tetrax.

05:22.577 --> 05:25.578
Want to take a deep breath
and tell me what's going on?

05:25.613 --> 05:27.080
Huh?
Who are you?

05:27.115 --> 05:28.815
<i>Move it, yokel!</i>

05:28.850 --> 05:33.587
Stick a fork in yourself,
alien scum. You're toast!

05:33.622 --> 05:34.855
Huh?

05:34.890 --> 05:36.489
<i>Attention, attention!</i>

05:36.525 --> 05:39.526
<i>Ben 23 has found another
evil-alien threat.</i>

05:39.561 --> 05:43.830
<i>Which hero will our champion turn into?</i>

05:43.866 --> 05:49.035
Well, if no one else will say it,
this must be a dimension

05:49.071 --> 05:51.738
that closely parallels our own.

05:51.774 --> 05:54.975
Oh, I hate those.
- The worst!

05:55.010 --> 05:58.479
At first, everything looks
normal, but then, "wham!"

05:58.514 --> 06:01.081
You find out that
super-Intelligent dolphins won

06:01.117 --> 06:04.252
the civil war, and pretty soon
we all end up in an alien zoo!

06:04.287 --> 06:09.290
All right, you off-world
hater, you're about to get beat by...

06:09.325 --> 06:11.625
Freeze Lizard!

06:11.661 --> 06:14.629
<i>It's Freeze Lizard!
If your club card says</i>

06:14.664 --> 06:18.967
<i>"Freeze Lizard," stop by any
Mr. Gyro for a free 32-ounce soda!</i>

06:19.002 --> 06:22.803
<i>Mr. Gyro ... Ben 23's
favorite place on Earth.</i>

06:22.839 --> 06:26.040
Mr. Gyro?
- Every single place that's a

06:26.075 --> 06:29.377
Mr. Smoothy in our universe
is a Mr. Gyro in this universe!

06:29.412 --> 06:32.613
Last time, I took
your hover board, alien.

06:32.649 --> 06:36.417
Now I'll take your ... ohh!

06:36.452 --> 06:39.520
Hey, man.
Not cool!

06:47.461 --> 06:50.530
Should I interfere?
I might change history.

06:50.566 --> 06:53.333
This is dimension
travel, not time travel.

06:53.368 --> 06:55.335
Oh. Yeah.

07:14.087 --> 07:15.587
It's Gyro time!

07:16.823 --> 07:20.491
You guys stay behind and
help fix the store's generator.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.992
It's as good as done.

07:22.028 --> 07:23.060
Maybe better.

07:23.095 --> 07:24.862
Fix it?
Whatever for?

07:24.897 --> 07:27.497
I won't be leaving here for some
time.

07:27.533 --> 07:30.867
Did you not hear what
they said? No Mr. Smoothys!

07:30.903 --> 07:34.338
Professor, I'm not too
sure they like aliens here.

07:34.373 --> 07:36.407
We'd all better keep a low profile.

07:36.442 --> 07:39.610
It got a little
drastic there for a while, will,

07:39.645 --> 07:41.746
but I just kept thinking of the
fans.

07:43.216 --> 07:47.252
... and the new Ben 23 poster
free with every large aegean meal!

07:47.287 --> 07:49.488
It's better than the best!

07:49.523 --> 07:53.391
<i>It's Ben ... insanely,
completely Ben, yeah!</i>

07:56.963 --> 08:00.031
I got him.

08:00.066 --> 08:02.434
Hold it, alien!
Who are you?

08:02.469 --> 08:04.269
Did the Intellectuary send you?

08:04.304 --> 08:08.273
The who-tellectuary?
Never heard of him, but don't worry.

08:08.308 --> 08:11.576
I think you and I are
sort of related.

08:11.612 --> 08:15.247
Dude!
- I know, right?

08:17.717 --> 08:20.753
Intellectuary, there's
a second Ben Tennyson.

08:20.788 --> 08:24.023
<i>Unexpected, but not unforeseeable.</i>

08:24.058 --> 08:26.792
<i>We will take care of them both.</i>

08:28.856 --> 08:30.857
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

08:30.892 --> 08:33.592
Ben 10, huh?
I'm 13 better than that ...

08:33.628 --> 08:35.628
the richest, most
famous guy in the world!

08:35.664 --> 08:37.063
I'm basically in charge.

08:37.099 --> 08:40.166
Yeah, not quite the same
setup in my dimension.

08:40.202 --> 08:41.701
That's too bad.

08:41.736 --> 08:44.571
You'd really like being the
world's greatest hero.

08:44.606 --> 08:47.274
I'm that, but
not the other ... famous.

08:47.309 --> 08:51.044
Well, I am famous,
but not rich and...

08:51.079 --> 08:54.681
Hey, this is my guest.
Load him up!

08:54.716 --> 08:58.885
Ben 23 pennants, poster, bumper
stickers, t-shirts, hamster

08:58.920 --> 09:02.755
cages, stuffed gyros,
oh, and a pocket watch.

09:02.791 --> 09:05.425
Man, you must really
love your gyros.

09:06.761 --> 09:08.227
Yokel food.
You want some?

09:08.263 --> 09:09.929
These guys will hook you up for free.

09:09.964 --> 09:11.731
Yeah, I'm more of a smoothy guy.

09:11.766 --> 09:13.866
Smoothies? Yuck!

09:13.902 --> 09:17.737
Frank! I'm at store 55, and
there aren't any more movie cups!

09:17.772 --> 09:19.171
It opens in a month!

09:19.207 --> 09:22.208
All right.
Get me that car endorsement!

09:22.244 --> 09:24.911
There used to be a place that
sold smoothies.

09:24.946 --> 09:28.347
I turned into giant-manster and
accidentally stepped on it.

09:28.383 --> 09:30.683
Not into smoothies ...
got it.

09:30.718 --> 09:34.119
So why only Ben 10?
Is that all the aliens you got?

09:34.155 --> 09:36.922
It used to be 10.
Now I have more than 70.

09:36.957 --> 09:39.824
Yeah, I don't really
have just 23 aliens.

09:39.860 --> 09:45.130
More like, uh, fif... uh, 90!
How do you roll yours out?

09:45.165 --> 09:47.199
Huh?
I hit the watch.

09:47.234 --> 09:52.003
No, I mean, how do
you stoke the demand?

09:52.038 --> 09:53.003
No more autographs!

09:53.806 --> 09:55.907
Always
leave them wanting more.

09:55.942 --> 09:56.975
Know what I'm saying?

09:57.010 --> 09:59.310
While you're busy
stoking your demand, what

09:59.346 --> 10:02.263
happens if a heavy hitter like
Vilgax attacks?

10:02.298 --> 10:06.217
Never heard of him.
- Who ordered the calamari?

10:07.921 --> 10:11.990
Driba, my boy, a share in
store 23 could be profitable,

10:12.025 --> 10:15.227
yes, yes, yes ...
quite profitable, indeed...

10:16.297 --> 10:17.663
...for the right buyer.

10:17.698 --> 10:21.133
I'm not about the profit!
I'm about the avoid being chased

10:21.169 --> 10:23.569
by an alien mob
and put in an alien zoo!

10:23.605 --> 10:26.139
Warp us out of here, Mr. Blukic!

10:28.376 --> 10:32.146
That ought to hold.
Stand back.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.521
What's the recursive quantum
delineator reading?

10:40.556 --> 10:41.421
23. Hmm...

10:41.457 --> 10:46.960
23rd dimension, 23 on the
delineator, store 23, Ben 23.

10:46.996 --> 10:51.232
Something's going on here.
- Numeric concatenation.

10:51.267 --> 10:54.268
You could argue it's the
basis for all physics.

10:54.303 --> 10:56.570
No, you can't.
- Yes, you can.

10:56.606 --> 11:00.074
No, you can't.
- But the point is you can argue.

11:03.980 --> 11:07.749
<i>- A lady.
- A paying customer?</i>

11:07.784 --> 11:12.654
<i>- Ohh, but I am obviously an alien.
- Well, I'm not going out there.</i>

11:13.690 --> 11:14.422
<i>Nuh-unh!</i>

11:15.659 --> 11:19.995
<i>- You and your alien zoo!
- Mama Driba didn't raise no fools.</i>

11:21.165 --> 11:23.277
<i>Just a moment! Ohh.</i>

11:25.528 --> 11:27.753
<i>See?</i>

11:27.788 --> 11:32.124
A little mystery, a little sucker bait.
"Who is alien 24?"

11:32.160 --> 11:34.193
Looks like Feedback.

11:34.228 --> 11:38.498
Whoa, great name.
I was gonna go with "Plug-man."

11:38.533 --> 11:43.002
So, when Feedback is revealed,
guess what I do? That's right!

11:43.038 --> 11:47.141
I stop using one alien, he goes
back into the Ben 23 vault for

11:47.176 --> 11:51.211
a few years, and then
he makes a big comeback.

11:51.247 --> 11:54.381
Uh-huh.

11:55.350 --> 11:57.817
<i>Ben.
Call me when you get this.</i>

11:57.853 --> 12:00.186
Whoa.
Was that grandpa Max?

12:00.222 --> 12:02.455
I haven't thought about him in years.

12:02.491 --> 12:06.593
Wait, there's no grandpa here?

12:06.628 --> 12:10.230
How'd you learn to use that Omnitrix?
- You mean my hero watch?

12:10.265 --> 12:14.534
Turns me into Ben aliens so I
can fight the evil monster hater aliens.

12:14.570 --> 12:16.903
Nothing to learn.
I've been thinking, though.

12:22.578 --> 12:25.879
Maybe you flash me some more of
your aliens, you know, in case

12:25.915 --> 12:28.282
there's, like, one I
haven't unlocked yet.

12:29.317 --> 12:31.485
Now,
let's put a pin in that!

12:31.520 --> 12:33.786
Oh, I already got that one.

12:33.822 --> 12:36.055
Hey, we got cops for crooks and stuff.

12:36.091 --> 12:39.259
Well, you can't
just let them get away.

12:40.262 --> 12:43.662
Just hold them off till I call
in the cameras?

12:56.876 --> 12:59.545
Dude, that was
completely Ben!

12:59.580 --> 13:01.279
Boom!
Bye-bye, thug-mobile!

13:01.315 --> 13:04.683
Now what? You just wait
for the cops or something?

13:04.718 --> 13:07.052
Cops?
Or Plumbers.

13:07.088 --> 13:10.723
Plumbers?
Why, you break a toilet somewhere?

13:16.397 --> 13:19.299
Greetings, fellow hu-man.

13:19.334 --> 13:23.403
We ...
I was using the Earth facilities.

13:24.873 --> 13:27.273
Would you like a grasshopper smoothy?

13:27.309 --> 13:32.111
<i>Push the bananaberry kelp,
my boy. We have tons of it!</i>

13:32.147 --> 13:35.381
Aliens!
He-e-e-elp!

13:41.556 --> 13:45.025
Vomit Man.
Mr. Mucky.

13:45.060 --> 13:47.661
Don't know him.
Dog-nab-it!

13:47.697 --> 13:51.265
That's a pun, get it?
- I'm starting to get it.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.934
Hey, my agent has an idea.

13:53.969 --> 13:57.170
We should do a team-up.
I'm thinking reality show.

13:57.206 --> 14:01.041
We both got evil aliens to catch
and Ben aliens to do it with.

14:01.076 --> 14:03.610
A little more to it than that.

14:03.645 --> 14:07.213
Sure, there's the
Intellectuary, too ...

14:07.249 --> 14:08.681
always after your hero watch.

14:08.717 --> 14:13.553
Ben, these aliens you turn into ...
they're not the only good ones.

14:13.588 --> 14:17.090
Where I come from, aliens aren't
automatically evil monsters.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.759
Some just live in town,
like my best friend.

14:19.795 --> 14:22.629
Mind ... blown.

14:30.471 --> 14:34.007
<i>Attention, attention!
We have another alien attack!</i>

14:34.043 --> 14:39.146
<i>Which hero will our
champion turn into? Rollaway!</i>

14:57.097 --> 15:00.899
Whoa!
- Hang on, Ben.

15:17.381 --> 15:19.349
Take him down, Ben.

15:32.564 --> 15:34.598
I'm gonna blow up!
- Don't worry.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.534
Just got to run through all the
possible codes.

15:52.016 --> 15:54.151
Cover your ears!

15:56.522 --> 15:59.790
Dude, I can't thank you enough.

15:59.825 --> 16:02.559
But now it's Gyro time!

16:08.734 --> 16:11.102
<i>Tennyson!</i>

16:11.137 --> 16:13.738
Oh, man!
- Oh, man!

16:24.478 --> 16:26.312
Electricyeti!

16:26.348 --> 16:29.015
I call this one "Heatblast."

16:29.050 --> 16:32.719
Oh, nice!
I had Charcoal-man.

16:40.762 --> 16:42.728
Ohh, this dweeb is mine.

17:04.050 --> 17:07.419
Hey! I wonder where
the news cameras are.

17:07.454 --> 17:08.954
<i>Attention, citizens.</i>

17:08.990 --> 17:12.723
<i>An entire nest of evil aliens
has been discovered!</i>

17:16.395 --> 17:22.833
<i>Aliens, you have 30 seconds
till we come in after you.</i>

17:30.676 --> 17:33.210
Let's wrap this up!

17:48.328 --> 17:52.197
Azmuth!
- Make a wish, alien! I'm a ...

17:52.232 --> 17:55.034
<i>Ben, cool your jets!</i>

17:55.035 --> 17:59.571
This guy created your watch.
- The hero watch?

18:00.641 --> 18:03.676
It's called an Omnitrix.

18:03.711 --> 18:06.412
Hey!
- You're rich, and you haven't

18:06.447 --> 18:09.282
killed anybody yet, kid.
Stop while you're ahead.

18:09.318 --> 18:11.584
Don't be hatin'!
It's mine!

18:12.654 --> 18:15.488
It was meant for your grandfather.

18:15.524 --> 18:19.259
That doesn't...
you knew grandpa Max?

18:19.294 --> 18:25.065
Yes, sadly, it arrived too late.
He was already gone.

18:25.101 --> 18:28.835
And it looks like other realities
have suffered the same fate.

18:28.871 --> 18:31.104
Nope, I've still got my Max.

18:31.140 --> 18:34.975
He gives me advice, keeps me from...
from becoming you, I guess.

18:35.010 --> 18:37.878
Hey!
That's not fair!

18:37.913 --> 18:42.649
I... I miss grandpa Max.
- Of course you do.

18:42.685 --> 18:45.552
Merchandise and endorsements
are no substitute.

18:45.587 --> 18:49.523
Who asked you, alien?!
- Ben, you don't get it!

18:49.558 --> 18:53.127
You just almost crossed a line ...
one there's no coming back from.

18:53.162 --> 18:57.898
Okay, whatever, I get it.
The little monster's not evil.

18:57.933 --> 19:01.835
So what you did was...
- Wrong. But ...

19:01.871 --> 19:04.838
No buts.
You're gonna start acting your age

19:04.874 --> 19:08.208
'cause I know you want to be
a hero more than a mogul.

19:08.243 --> 19:13.346
Says Ben blen!
- Says me, who is you.

19:13.381 --> 19:17.049
Well, how am I
supposed to know the good aliens

19:17.084 --> 19:20.518
from the bad ones?
I don't have a grandpa. You do.

19:20.554 --> 19:23.288
There are other people out
there who can help.

19:23.323 --> 19:24.489
You're not alone.

19:24.524 --> 19:27.425
We just couldn't penetrate
that tough skull of yours.

19:27.461 --> 19:29.961
Sorry I
tried to rip you in half.

19:29.996 --> 19:34.299
Yes, but in another
dimension, another you found

19:34.334 --> 19:41.240
a better use for another Omnitrix.
We need to explore that.

19:41.275 --> 19:43.442
I think this is yours.

19:46.681 --> 19:49.348
<i>On three!
One, two ...</i>

19:49.384 --> 19:54.554
Stop! I'll vouch for
this store and the monsters inside.

19:54.589 --> 19:58.525
At least he didn't say
"evil monster hater aliens."

19:58.560 --> 19:59.759
It's a start.

19:59.795 --> 20:03.263
And now that I've
saved the day, it's ...

20:03.298 --> 20:06.600
Smoothy time!
- Oh, my, my, my, my, my!

20:06.636 --> 20:09.270
<i>What a booming business!</i>

20:09.305 --> 20:13.374
<i>Cleaned out of every flavor of
Mr. Smoothy, but smelt petunia.</i>

20:13.409 --> 20:15.810
Well, some people just don't
like smelt.

20:15.846 --> 20:18.046
Oh, well, well, well.
- That'll do.

20:18.082 --> 20:21.116
Now switch off the stabilizers
between dimensions.

20:21.151 --> 20:25.321
You've been doing the equivalent
of stepping on the brake and the

20:25.356 --> 20:28.424
accelerator at the same time.
- I feel silly.

20:28.460 --> 20:32.495
Truly, you are the first
thinker, parallel-world Azmuth.

20:32.530 --> 20:35.264
And you're brilliant scientists...

20:35.299 --> 20:36.332
Ooh!
- Ooh!

20:36.367 --> 20:38.201
...by Earth standards.

20:38.236 --> 20:41.671
For a couple of Galvans, you're
remarkably unintelligent.

20:41.706 --> 20:42.605
Ohh.
- Ohh.

20:42.641 --> 20:45.809
Listen to this guy like
you'd listen to Max.

20:45.844 --> 20:49.412
I don't want to have to come back
and save your butt... or kick it.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.848
You don't have to
worry about me.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.684
The only big enemy I ever had
was the Intellectuary.

20:54.719 --> 20:56.386
And it turns out he wasn't bad.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.488
So what could go wrong now?
Nothing.

20:58.524 --> 21:01.025
Nothing could possibly go wrong.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.895
You okay?
- Yeah.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.664
Truly, this is not the
universe we know.

21:07.699 --> 21:12.102
Which reminds me, I've got
some unfinished business back home.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.037
<i>Leave now?</i>

21:13.072 --> 21:16.674
Oh, but ... but, my boy,
this store just started paying off!

21:20.647 --> 21:25.951
<i>Ohh, look at them ... sipping
a Smoothy like they were born to it!</i>

21:25.987 --> 21:31.223
<i>Oh, my lad, what a lost
opportunity for profit!</i>

21:35.562 --> 21:39.899
Grandpa Max!
- Ben.

21:40.934 --> 21:43.467
You can't just take off like
that without letting anybody

21:43.503 --> 21:46.637
know where you're going. You're
gonna be 17, for crying out ...

21:46.672 --> 21:50.707
Ohh, why are you
looking at me like that?

21:50.743 --> 21:53.777
Nothing.
Just keep yelling at me.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.048
Well, okay.
