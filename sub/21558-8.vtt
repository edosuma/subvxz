WEBVTT

00:18.435 --> 00:20.728
[Luke] I don't care how dangerous
you say these people are.

00:21.479 --> 00:22.855
I don't want any part of this.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.150
We're here to get Danny,
but Colleen's right,

00:25.233 --> 00:27.652
this won't end there.
The Hand will keep coming after us.

00:27.735 --> 00:29.404
This is our chance
to shut 'em down for good.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.616
They will come back. Again and again.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.286
But these could end them forever.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.830
I get that you have a history
with these people.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.458
So do you. So does she.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.751
And so did that kid from Harlem.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.504
Detonating a bomb here
won't fix what happened to him.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.131
Okay? Not by a long shot.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.134
No, but it might help everyone else
who will be in danger.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.886
And make no mistake,
people will be in danger.

00:56.348 --> 00:57.349
I... [sighs]

00:57.974 --> 00:59.559
I just can't go along with this.

01:04.106 --> 01:05.107
Okay.

01:06.816 --> 01:10.487
For the record, everything that's
been said in the past two minutes...

01:11.279 --> 01:12.989
is 100% insane.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.574
Thank you.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.744
But...

01:18.578 --> 01:19.996
Sweet Sister.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.624
...we all know what the Hand
is capable of.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.877
We've all been affected.

01:27.044 --> 01:28.671
But they keep coming back.

01:30.298 --> 01:35.262
And when they do,
it's not just crime, it's horror movie...

01:36.263 --> 01:37.805
murdery shit.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.891
If we don't do this, it's gonna get worse.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.977
Take down the building
or the Hand takes down New York.

01:43.060 --> 01:45.855
This is not how I fix things.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.318
[Jessica] These people
have come after our friends.

01:51.986 --> 01:53.446
They're showing no signs of stopping.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.448
Jess!

01:56.449 --> 01:59.161
You know that I've wanted nothing
to do with this from the beginning.

01:59.827 --> 02:01.954
The architect's brains
are still in my apartment.

02:02.038 --> 02:05.167
I haven't changed my clothes.
Let's just get this shit over with.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.629
We'll all sleep easier once they're gone.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.132
We can all just...

02:13.258 --> 02:16.052
[sighs] get on with our lives.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.849
If we do this...

02:24.060 --> 02:28.273
no one but those...
Hand monsters gets hurt.

02:30.442 --> 02:33.820
Okay? Not one single innocent person.
Can we all agree to that?

02:36.698 --> 02:37.824
Yep.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.328
Okay, then.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.081
[sighs] Can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

02:47.917 --> 02:49.711
let's go do something crazy.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.796
[theme music playing]

04:08.122 --> 04:09.249
It's true.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.256
[Gao] You doubted the power of K'un-Lun?

04:19.216 --> 04:23.430
These creatures once roamed
the green valleys of my home.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.974
These fossils are all that remain.

04:27.892 --> 04:31.271
The last known deposit on Earth.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.399
[Elektra] Secure the entrance.
The Iron Fist is here somewhere.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.402
[Gao] It no longer matters.
The door is open.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.323
-Well, he needs to die.
-Of course.

04:41.406 --> 04:46.035
But it is in our best interest
to remove the substance with urgency.

04:46.118 --> 04:47.412
Where are the others?

04:48.245 --> 04:51.499
-Securing our escape.
-From what?

04:52.083 --> 04:53.960
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen,

04:54.043 --> 04:57.004
the man who does not break
and the unyielding woman.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.381
They are here.

04:59.131 --> 05:01.801
We held them back as long as we could.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.053
The war has been won.

05:04.136 --> 05:06.806
I decide when we've won.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.477
Once we've removed the substance...

05:11.227 --> 05:14.772
the foundation of the city
will continue to weaken.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.859
A swath of New York will crumble.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.151
Many will die.

05:22.279 --> 05:23.865
It's just a city.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.284
They rise. They fall.

05:29.245 --> 05:31.456
You'll see many more.

05:49.098 --> 05:50.808
[breathing heavily]

05:53.353 --> 05:54.937
From what we could tell,
the architect's plan

05:55.021 --> 05:57.106
was to place explosives
in the building's structural center.

05:57.189 --> 05:58.858
I mean, these look like support beams.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.610
So without them, the building can't stand.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.405
Once we find these, we plant the C-4.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.197
No remote detonator.

06:06.073 --> 06:08.325
-What's that mean?
-It's a time bomb.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.412
Once you hit "go,"
you've got a matter of minutes.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.705
-Are you sure about that?
-Kind of.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.832
-Oh, that's encouraging.
-It's basic training.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.419
They taught us how to run
from the bombs, not set 'em.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.171
So what you're saying
is once someone activates the charge...

06:20.254 --> 06:21.380
That's it.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.633
You two put 'em in place.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.510
Once we're out of the hole,
hit the charge, get out.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.387
Wait, what?
No, I am going down with you.

06:28.471 --> 06:31.182
Last time I stayed behind,
Danny got drugged and kidnapped.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.643
What part of this shitstorm
sounds like staying behind?

06:33.726 --> 06:35.853
This shitstorm is my life.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.189
Colleen, the three of them
have certain abilities.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.107
-I can fight.
-Exactly.

06:40.191 --> 06:43.235
I'm saying, as your friend,
if I'm going to do this,

06:43.319 --> 06:45.321
I need your help a lot more than they do.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.663
-Promise me that you won't fail him again.
-I'll make it right.

06:55.122 --> 06:57.542
-I owe him that much.
-[police sirens wailing in distance]

06:57.625 --> 06:58.626
This way.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.547
I'll be back, Claire. I promise.

07:09.679 --> 07:13.683
As far as we can tell, the building itself
is on some type of hi-tech lockdown.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.184
Bulletproof glass, the works.

07:15.267 --> 07:17.437
I want teams on every entrance.
Gotta be some way in.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.688
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.773
-[cell phone ringing]
-[Misty] What?

07:21.983 --> 07:24.861
-Are you kidding me?
-What is it, Knight?

07:26.863 --> 07:28.656
Evidence locker at the station was hit.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.366
-When?
-About an hour or so ago.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.952
They just discovered it.
The C-4 is missing.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.286
The stuff from the motel?

07:34.370 --> 07:35.747
-All of it.
-Well, who did it?

07:35.830 --> 07:38.332
Surveillance was down,
so they don't know who.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.168
Well, I'll give you three guesses.

07:41.252 --> 07:43.838
-Captain, we don't know what happened--
-Bullshit.

07:43.921 --> 07:45.507
You're pissed 'cause you vouched for 'em.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.134
The question now is
what are they gonna do with it?

07:52.054 --> 07:54.431
-[Misty sighs] Oh, shit!
-Jesus Christ.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.809
-Get bomb squad now!
-[officer on radio] Copy that.

07:56.893 --> 08:00.312
Evacuate everything in a two-block radius.
And get ESU here.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.856
-We got a door to breach.
-[cop] Yes, sir.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.775
I'll let you know
when the teams are assembled.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.027
Okay, Knight.
If you still work here by then.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.195
-[helicopter approaching]
-[cop] We're getting more support!

08:08.279 --> 08:09.989
Get those people out!
Get those people out!

08:16.538 --> 08:18.455
[footsteps approaching]

08:23.460 --> 08:24.504
[Trish] Holy shit.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.971
[Karen sighs]

08:37.433 --> 08:39.060
They came after me, too.

08:42.271 --> 08:45.900
I thought Jessica was exaggerating.
I didn't know it was this bad.

08:46.901 --> 08:50.237
Yeah, well, it is. Has been for a while.

08:52.364 --> 08:55.702
[sighs] Um... I was, uh, there.

08:58.287 --> 09:01.833
They took hostages. Watched someone die.

09:05.252 --> 09:06.503
I'm glad you're okay.

09:07.254 --> 09:08.673
-Are any of us okay?
-[chuckles]

09:08.756 --> 09:10.132
[electricity surges]

09:11.718 --> 09:13.135
Well, that could be good.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.013
[sighs]

09:17.932 --> 09:20.351
At my radio station, I tried to float...

09:21.102 --> 09:23.771
that the earthquake was a cover-up
for something else.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.732
Really?

09:26.357 --> 09:27.483
What happened?

09:28.776 --> 09:32.113
-I was shut down. [sighs]
-By who? Your boss?

09:32.196 --> 09:33.447
-Yeah.
-Shit.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.618
If what Jessica says is true...

09:37.744 --> 09:40.246
this Hand organization is powerful.

09:41.538 --> 09:42.832
They could've quashed the story.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.501
Yeah, well, it probably means
you're right. But...

09:46.669 --> 09:50.422
[sighs] But, I know that we can get
to the truth. We just have to...

09:51.007 --> 09:53.217
Have to be willing to play
close to the fire, right?

09:54.051 --> 09:57.054
-Jessica is the fire.
-[both chuckle]

09:58.973 --> 10:00.224
What about that guy?

10:01.017 --> 10:03.019
Uh, the... the lawyer you work with?

10:03.936 --> 10:05.730
-Matt.
-Yeah, what's his deal?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.983
Um... he's a good friend.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.568
It's... He's, um...

10:12.361 --> 10:14.238
It's complicated. [chuckles]

10:16.365 --> 10:17.784
Jessica's a good friend, too.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.746
I mean, not in the traditional sense.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.373
You can't rely on her to...

10:25.499 --> 10:28.460
move a couch or plan a party, but...

10:30.379 --> 10:32.089
when it comes to the real stuff...

10:34.676 --> 10:37.219
the stuff that'll last forever...

10:38.805 --> 10:40.097
[Foggy] Uh, ladies?

10:40.181 --> 10:42.725
We just heard a dispatcher call
for all available units.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.394
-To where?
-Hell's Kitchen.

10:45.477 --> 10:48.397
Some place called Midland Circle.
44th and 11th Avenue.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.482
-[softly] Midland Circle.
-That was the epicenter.

10:50.566 --> 10:51.608
Of what?

10:52.568 --> 10:53.736
Everything.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.989
You're right.
This place is completely empty.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.993
[Daredevil] A lot of activity
under the building now.

11:13.547 --> 11:14.882
[knocks echoing]

11:16.843 --> 11:18.052
Here, I need you to...

11:19.345 --> 11:20.387
open this.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.890
-[Luke] Open what?
-It's a door.

11:23.557 --> 11:26.393
-Something mechanical behind it.
-What do you mean, "mechanical"?

11:50.001 --> 11:52.169
[Luke] How deep does this go?

11:53.420 --> 11:54.546
It's hard to tell.

11:56.924 --> 12:00.302
The more I think about it,
the less I like our odds.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.348
Yeah, well, do like me.
Don't think about it.

12:06.225 --> 12:09.812
[Jessica] If you told me a week ago
that I'd be here with you two,

12:09.896 --> 12:13.732
about to blow up some building
and fight ninjas to save New York...

12:13.816 --> 12:16.402
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-[Jessica sighs]

12:17.319 --> 12:19.655
For whatever it's worth,
I'm glad you're here.

12:21.490 --> 12:22.491
What?

12:24.118 --> 12:25.577
The circumstances could be better.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.414
I'm just saying, you know,
I'm glad we found each other.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.876
-I'm not hugging you.
-[sighs]

12:31.959 --> 12:33.169
You guys ready or what?

12:35.337 --> 12:38.090
-[Luke] No.
-[Daredevil sighs] No.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.466
[Jessica] Sounds about right.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.073
-It should be right up ahead.
-Okay.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.577
Claire, for what it's worth,

13:06.660 --> 13:09.496
I know Luke and the other guys
have abilities, but so do you.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.581
What?

13:11.540 --> 13:15.252
You have saved just as many lives,
helped just as many people.

13:15.962 --> 13:19.006
[chuckles] You just don't make
the headlines.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.343
You're going to make me blush. [chuckles]

13:24.470 --> 13:25.471
This is it.

13:29.683 --> 13:31.477
How do we know what we're looking for?

13:33.104 --> 13:34.146
Oh.

13:41.904 --> 13:42.905
[bag unzipping]

13:55.542 --> 13:56.585
[beeps]

13:58.170 --> 13:59.380
[door opens]

14:00.214 --> 14:02.299
[whispering] Somebody's coming.
Somebody's coming.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.570
[police sirens wailing]

14:27.074 --> 14:28.284
[sighs]

14:31.120 --> 14:32.121
[grunts]

14:32.829 --> 14:36.542
This is not okay. This shit is not okay.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.091
I will find you.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.386
[mouthing] No.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.097
No need.

14:51.598 --> 14:52.892
I'm done hiding.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.227
Colleen...

14:56.562 --> 14:58.064
we meet again.

15:00.607 --> 15:02.651
I told you our fates are aligned.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.528
Except it's not fate.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.323
I came here to end this.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.783
[cell phone ringing]

15:11.702 --> 15:13.120
[Claire panting]

15:16.748 --> 15:20.669
Did you come for me?
Or did you simply follow?

15:21.587 --> 15:24.465
I trained you to believe in yourself
and your purpose.

15:24.548 --> 15:25.716
It's not too late.

15:27.134 --> 15:28.885
[Colleen grunting]

15:28.970 --> 15:30.721
[cell phone ringing]

15:34.100 --> 15:36.393
[Misty on phone]
Claire, what the hell is going on?

15:36.477 --> 15:38.229
Put Luke on the goddamn phone.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.480
[whispering] Real bad timing.

15:39.563 --> 15:42.066
Listen, you need
to get your asses out of there.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.443
One of your guys
brought bombs in the building.

15:44.526 --> 15:47.029
[sighs] Just make sure
to clear the block, okay?

15:47.112 --> 15:50.574
-There's a lot of this stuff in here.
-Wait a minute. You know about this?

15:51.242 --> 15:55.662
Claire, whatever it is you're planning,
it ends in either jail or a cemetery.

15:55.746 --> 15:56.872
-Please.
-[swords clashing]

15:56.956 --> 15:59.667
You guys are in way over your heads.
All of you.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.377
[sighs] Believe me, I know.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.338
-[Colleen and Bakuto grunting]
-[swords continue clashing]

16:04.421 --> 16:07.091
What's that sound? What's happening?

16:08.217 --> 16:09.218
Claire!

16:12.596 --> 16:13.930
Oh, shit.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.607
[grunts]

16:28.362 --> 16:30.031
[buzz saw whirring]

16:40.874 --> 16:41.875
[body thuds]

16:55.014 --> 16:56.557
[Gao] You waste your energy.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.978
Save it... for the larger battle to come.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.982
[Danny] Is this place what I think it is?

17:07.151 --> 17:11.947
These beasts,
they've given both of us so much.

17:12.031 --> 17:17.661
Though even power great as yours
pales in the face of eternal life.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.165
This is what you've been after
the whole time?

17:22.041 --> 17:24.543
The very essence of what made you.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.090
You desecrate Shou-Lao.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.300
You punched him in the heart.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.677
The Elders of K'un-Lun were right.

17:35.011 --> 17:37.848
They showed way too much mercy
when they banished the Hand.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.351
And you think
you're going to right that wrong?

17:43.770 --> 17:45.772
It's what this journey has all been for.

17:46.690 --> 17:50.861
Then you are as naive
as when I first laid eyes on you.

17:51.653 --> 17:54.823
Just a child... walking with your mother.

17:56.200 --> 18:00.787
She made you hold her hand
as you crossed the street. [chuckles]

18:00.871 --> 18:03.957
You pulled away from her
as though you didn't need her.

18:05.584 --> 18:06.627
Tell me...

18:08.212 --> 18:11.798
what would you give
to hold that hand again?

18:17.513 --> 18:20.724
And here you are, alone.

18:22.726 --> 18:26.147
Trying to fulfill some prophecy.
All to numb your pain.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.235
You can't get into my head anymore.

18:33.945 --> 18:35.071
Now tell me...

18:36.198 --> 18:38.284
what are your plans with New York?

18:39.034 --> 18:42.037
Its time has come... to fall.

18:42.913 --> 18:43.997
-[grunts]
-[shouts]

18:46.417 --> 18:48.752
[elevator whirring]

18:48.835 --> 18:51.130
The elevator. [chuckles]

18:51.963 --> 18:54.300
-It's descending.
-[groaning]

18:59.305 --> 19:00.306
[Elektra] Wait!

19:03.934 --> 19:04.976
He could be useful.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.314
Perhaps you have found your family.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.658
Ten stories left. Give or take.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.705
Anyone waiting for us?

19:25.789 --> 19:26.915
Yeah, about 30 of 'em.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.042
All of 'em armed.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.045
Including two of the ones
we fought in the garage.

19:32.128 --> 19:35.048
-[Jessica] And the old lady?
-And the guy who speaks Japanese.

19:35.131 --> 19:36.883
What about your ex-girlfriend?

19:38.969 --> 19:40.179
Yeah.

19:41.472 --> 19:43.056
They knew we'd come for Danny.

19:44.725 --> 19:45.892
Guys, this is...

19:47.143 --> 19:49.145
a lot worse than what we faced before.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.273
That's an understatement.

19:54.109 --> 19:55.527
So how are we gonna handle it?

19:57.863 --> 19:59.155
I got an idea.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.200
But you're not gonna like it.

20:24.139 --> 20:25.181
Okay.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.519
Don't shoot. [sighs]

20:35.609 --> 20:39.488
Look, I don't give a shit
what you guys are doing...

20:40.614 --> 20:44.326
down here in your secret cave thing.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.580
I just came to talk.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.544
You started this.

20:55.837 --> 21:00.175
Ever since you burst into my office,
my life has become one big kung fu party.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.053
I don't wanna fight you.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.391
Alone.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.394
[men groaning]

21:11.144 --> 21:13.146
[all grunting]

21:36.670 --> 21:38.213
Let's go, Ironclad.

21:39.631 --> 21:40.674
It's Iron Fist.

21:40.757 --> 21:43.259
-I know.
-[chuckles]

21:46.388 --> 21:48.599
Do not bother wearing yourself out.

21:48.682 --> 21:49.975
[panting] I'm not.

21:57.023 --> 21:58.775
I know your limits.

22:00.110 --> 22:03.822
There's no damage that you can do to me
that can't be undone.

22:03.905 --> 22:07.701
Especially because the Iron Fist
has already given us the ultimate gift.

22:08.284 --> 22:09.911
Life without end.

22:11.079 --> 22:14.165
I'll give you one last chance
to experience it with me.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.959
To be who you were meant to be.

22:18.629 --> 22:20.422
I don't need you anymore.

22:53.747 --> 22:54.748
Asshole!

23:00.629 --> 23:02.380
-[grunts]
-[Claire] Colleen!

23:03.089 --> 23:04.633
[groans]

23:07.886 --> 23:09.680
-[gunshots]
-[man yells]

23:10.681 --> 23:12.223
What the hell did I just walk into?

23:12.974 --> 23:15.018
I ask myself that all the time.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.773
Drop it, or I'm dropping you.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.475
They're gonna destroy the city.

23:55.058 --> 23:56.560
Now tell me something I don't know.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.980
Once they get what they want,
this place is gonna crumble.

24:00.063 --> 24:01.189
Not on my watch.

24:01.272 --> 24:03.191
-[Daredevil] Where's Alexandra?
-She's dead.

24:03.274 --> 24:06.612
-Did you kill her?
-No. She did.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.913
Is that elevator the only way out of here?

24:16.997 --> 24:18.039
Yep.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.876
We can't leave. We have to end them.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.253
-We got a plan.
-Yeah, it involves bombs.

24:23.336 --> 24:24.963
You're cool with bombs, right?

24:25.589 --> 24:28.049
-Seriously?
-The only way out of here is together.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.639
Danny, light it up.

24:34.222 --> 24:35.223
Now.

24:43.732 --> 24:44.983
[both exclaim]

24:50.531 --> 24:52.574
[all groaning]

25:44.334 --> 25:45.168
[grunts]

25:54.678 --> 25:56.012
[yells]

26:00.934 --> 26:02.227
[Jessica grunts]

26:05.021 --> 26:06.607
[Danny and Daredevil grunt]

26:10.026 --> 26:12.320
-Remember this?
-Just like old times.

26:12.403 --> 26:13.363
[chuckles]

26:13.446 --> 26:14.906
[grunting]

26:19.786 --> 26:21.830
-[Danny groaning]
-[Elektra grunting]

26:27.210 --> 26:28.920
[panting]

26:35.093 --> 26:37.387
Asshole, I will put you down.

26:41.933 --> 26:42.768
[groans]

26:50.734 --> 26:52.193
You disappoint me.

26:59.492 --> 27:03.914
As a child, all you ever wanted
was to belong to something.

27:10.712 --> 27:14.507
That's why I saved you, Colleen.
Raised you.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.136
Because that same desire was once in me.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.856
Is this your family now? Hmm?

27:31.191 --> 27:32.150
Well...

27:32.818 --> 27:36.196
let me remind you who you really are
by taking that away.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.489
[Misty grunting]

27:38.573 --> 27:39.908
[screams]

27:40.992 --> 27:42.035
[groans]

27:48.834 --> 27:51.669
[bomb beeping]

27:51.753 --> 27:54.380
-Colleen!
-[Misty whimpering]

27:55.090 --> 27:58.509
She's losing too much blood.
We're gonna take care of you, okay?

27:58.593 --> 28:01.888
-[beeping continues]
-[Misty groaning]

28:27.413 --> 28:28.915
[bomb beeping]

28:48.935 --> 28:49.936
[Jessica grunts]

28:50.645 --> 28:51.980
[Elektra groans]

28:55.942 --> 28:57.986
-[Danny groans]
-You guys need to get to the surface.

28:58.069 --> 28:59.905
-No complaints here.
-What about you?

28:59.988 --> 29:01.823
-No, I'm gonna meet you up there.
-What?

29:02.490 --> 29:03.616
I can get through to her.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.494
-You back on that again?
-We're not gonna leave you here.

29:06.577 --> 29:09.289
You made a promise to get him back.
You better keep your word.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.085
Come on, guys.

29:17.672 --> 29:19.007
[whispers indistinctly]

29:20.675 --> 29:22.302
I'm right behind you. Go.

29:22.886 --> 29:23.970
[Jessica] Let's go!

29:48.787 --> 29:50.246
[both panting]

29:53.959 --> 29:56.044
Are you done hiding behind your friends?

29:57.462 --> 29:58.922
You're the one who's hiding, Elektra.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.549
What do you want, Matthew?

30:03.676 --> 30:04.760
I lost you once.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.388
I won't do it again.

30:08.723 --> 30:10.225
You know nothing.

30:12.268 --> 30:13.979
I know... I know I loved you.

30:19.692 --> 30:22.904
-Your heart will be your downfall.
-Please... listen to me.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.198
-I don't want to hurt you.
-Too bad.

30:32.413 --> 30:34.124
[panting]

30:44.592 --> 30:46.136
It's not too late to stop fighting.

30:48.930 --> 30:50.098
We can still walk out of here.

30:50.181 --> 30:51.224
Together.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.145
Just like you wanted to before.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.564
[breathing heavily]

30:59.232 --> 31:01.276
Before you let me die?

31:03.653 --> 31:05.321
-[Elektra exclaims]
-[groans]

31:07.532 --> 31:09.367
[groaning]

31:12.287 --> 31:13.288
No.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.041
Before they took you from me.

31:17.083 --> 31:19.044
Before they turned you into their weapon.

31:20.336 --> 31:22.088
You are not the Black Sky.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.509
You are Elektra Natchios.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.262
And you've never been anyone's slave.

31:30.680 --> 31:34.559
I appreciate the sentiment, Matthew,
but I know who I am.

31:36.937 --> 31:41.524
The Hand did not reduce me to this.
This is who I've always been.

31:44.402 --> 31:47.613
You forget... I know when you're lying.

31:48.281 --> 31:50.283
You've always wanted to find light in me.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.661
Look where it brought you.

31:54.537 --> 31:55.914
There is goodness in you.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.249
I know 'cause I felt it.

32:06.841 --> 32:09.219
I don't care about good or bad.

32:10.971 --> 32:15.725
Truth is, I've never felt more whole,
more alive, than right now.

32:16.684 --> 32:19.895
Then let's live.
We can still make it out of here.

32:26.569 --> 32:28.113
-[motor jamming]
-[Danny gasps]

32:29.655 --> 32:31.950
-What's happening?
-This thing's about to drop.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.541
[creaking]

32:42.752 --> 32:44.045
[man screams]

32:53.763 --> 32:55.348
[yelling]

32:59.852 --> 33:01.396
[elevator thuds]

33:07.986 --> 33:09.362
No way.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.198
[Jessica straining]

33:21.457 --> 33:23.168
Stop staring. Start climbing.

33:25.670 --> 33:26.671
Now!

33:36.347 --> 33:37.890
[beeping]

33:59.662 --> 34:00.996
[chuckles]

34:02.707 --> 34:06.461
If this is who you truly are,
why haven't you killed me yet?

34:07.045 --> 34:09.630
-You've had your chance.
-I've had many.

34:11.049 --> 34:15.095
If I truly mean nothing to you,
if there's truly no light inside of you,

34:15.178 --> 34:16.596
why not just do it?

34:17.680 --> 34:19.474
Because the game is fun.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.567
No. It's 'cause you still feel.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.361
[panting]

34:45.083 --> 34:46.959
For all your talk
of embracing the darkness,

34:47.042 --> 34:48.628
I don't think you want to be alone in it.

34:51.631 --> 34:54.300
-I've seen death.
-And you're afraid of it.

34:54.384 --> 34:55.635
Not anymore.

34:55.718 --> 34:58.221
Because you'll be by my side,
where you belong.

35:06.312 --> 35:07.147
Colleen?

35:07.938 --> 35:08.814
Danny!

35:08.898 --> 35:11.150
-What happened?
-She's bleeding out.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.736
Bakuto set off the detonator.
This building is about to explode.

35:13.820 --> 35:16.072
-Come on.
-Wait. We have to go back.

35:16.156 --> 35:17.615
-Why?
-[Jessica] What?

35:18.741 --> 35:20.868
-Matt knew.
-Well, we can't leave him down there.

35:20.951 --> 35:22.578
-[cop] Go, go, go.
-Hold it right there!

35:25.540 --> 35:27.333
There are bombs in this building!
We gotta go!

35:27.417 --> 35:29.084
Hands in the air! Now!

35:31.587 --> 35:32.588
I'm sorry.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.176
I can't let this happen.

35:36.967 --> 35:40.095
[officer on radio] 10-33. 10-33.
All officers evacuate.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.973
Evacuate. 10-33, Midland Circle.

36:07.832 --> 36:08.833
[groans]

36:14.004 --> 36:15.340
[chuckles]

36:17.633 --> 36:19.219
This is what we get, isn't it?

36:21.095 --> 36:22.930
For ever thinking we could make it work.

36:25.057 --> 36:26.434
Who says we didn't?

36:27.602 --> 36:29.645
We're together. [chuckles]

36:30.271 --> 36:33.691
Something I've wanted
since I first laid eyes on you.

36:35.025 --> 36:36.736
We can have it forever.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.456
[coughing]

36:51.166 --> 36:53.336
[breathing heavily]

37:00.676 --> 37:01.677
Gao...

37:03.263 --> 37:04.722
[in Japanese] What is happening?

37:06.557 --> 37:07.767
The end.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.560
[breathing heavily]

37:13.606 --> 37:15.441
[beeping]

37:15.525 --> 37:17.109
[police officer shouting]

37:17.192 --> 37:19.487
[Danny] Everybody get back! Get back!

37:20.363 --> 37:23.616
Take cover! Take cover!

37:23.699 --> 37:25.075
[glass shattering]

37:25.701 --> 37:28.120
[Claire shouting] You gotta help her!

37:38.088 --> 37:40.007
[both breathing heavily]

37:51.936 --> 37:53.479
I'm sorry, Matthew...

37:56.482 --> 37:59.234
for all the pain I've caused you
along the way.

38:03.531 --> 38:06.284
You know, we're gonna die here.

38:08.536 --> 38:09.537
No.

38:10.996 --> 38:13.333
This is what living feels like.

38:16.085 --> 38:17.337
[car alarms blaring]

38:36.981 --> 38:39.817
-[walls crumbling]
-[ground rumbling]

38:57.710 --> 38:59.795
[police sirens wailing]

39:11.974 --> 39:12.975
[scoffs]

39:14.143 --> 39:16.145
He had no intention
of making it out alive.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.615
Matt said something
before he told us to leave.

39:32.412 --> 39:33.954
He said, "Protect my city."

40:21.419 --> 40:22.712
[Karen] Jesus.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.004
[crying]

40:37.143 --> 40:38.936
[Trish on radio]
Finally getting some answers

40:39.019 --> 40:42.565
to all the mysterious shaking
and sinking around the city.

40:42.648 --> 40:44.609
The mayor's office confirms

40:44.692 --> 40:48.946
that unpermitted construction
around Midland Circle is to blame.

40:49.572 --> 40:54.284
Oddly enough, I'm told the implosion
actually settled the ground again,

40:54.368 --> 40:56.996
meaning we're off
to a more stable start today.

40:58.163 --> 41:01.083
It's certainly weird, but what can I say?

41:01.792 --> 41:04.169
It's just another day in New York City.

41:04.253 --> 41:07.131
At least... the rent is cheap?

41:07.214 --> 41:09.258
Your thoughts, next.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.762
[announcer] Trish Talk.
Thanks for listening.

41:23.731 --> 41:26.400
You're sure you don't want
anyone to know what you did?

41:28.068 --> 41:29.069
It's over.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.697
[sighs] That's all that matters.

41:31.781 --> 41:33.448
You should be proud.

41:34.283 --> 41:35.993
Think of how many lives you saved.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.039
And the one we lost.

41:41.916 --> 41:46.504
The NYPD didn't file any report,
so the city can't file any charges.

41:46.587 --> 41:48.964
According to the DA, it's over.

41:50.090 --> 41:52.760
Or more accurately, never happened.

41:55.345 --> 41:57.264
-Uh, what about Claire?
-[Claire sighs]

41:58.808 --> 42:00.017
Claire who?

42:01.894 --> 42:03.854
Hogarth, Benowitz &amp; Chao at your service.

42:03.938 --> 42:06.190
I hope you'll think of us
for all your legal needs.

42:07.149 --> 42:09.484
Uh, let's hope we don't have
any more legal needs.

42:10.069 --> 42:11.236
[Luke] Mr. Nelson...

42:13.280 --> 42:15.950
I'm sorry for your loss.

42:17.201 --> 42:18.493
Thank you.

42:18.578 --> 42:21.455
It's... all of our losses.

42:22.790 --> 42:23.833
I should go.

42:29.129 --> 42:31.256
I'll walk you out. [clears throat]

42:34.594 --> 42:36.261
Hey there, um...

42:37.471 --> 42:40.641
about our mutual friend
with the multiple lives...

42:41.183 --> 42:43.268
I always knew those lives
would get him killed.

42:44.144 --> 42:47.898
And in the end, I actually helped him
get to that building.

42:48.482 --> 42:50.067
In the suit, no less.

42:51.026 --> 42:52.987
If you'd have been there,
you would have seen...

42:54.029 --> 42:55.197
He made the right call.

42:57.116 --> 42:58.868
I can't help but feel like I didn't.

43:03.497 --> 43:05.415
Look, I didn't know him
as well as you did...

43:07.793 --> 43:09.837
but there was no talking him down.

43:10.796 --> 43:13.465
He had his mind made up the day I met him.

43:15.926 --> 43:17.011
He loved this city...

43:17.720 --> 43:19.096
and the people in it...

43:20.765 --> 43:22.307
more than he loved himself.

43:27.187 --> 43:28.230
Take care.

43:29.564 --> 43:32.902
And keep fighting the good fight for him.

43:43.412 --> 43:44.830
[Misty inhales sharply]

43:53.673 --> 43:54.674
Hi.

43:57.342 --> 43:58.427
Hey.

43:59.637 --> 44:00.721
How do you feel?

44:02.472 --> 44:03.598
Great.

44:07.102 --> 44:08.353
[sighs]

44:09.479 --> 44:11.899
Not quite whole.

44:16.737 --> 44:17.822
I'm so sorry.

44:18.405 --> 44:20.032
It is not your fault.

44:21.826 --> 44:23.160
It's not.

44:24.328 --> 44:25.537
It's the job.

44:27.289 --> 44:28.623
[sighs]

44:29.541 --> 44:30.542
Um...

44:31.335 --> 44:32.336
Danny...

44:33.253 --> 44:36.882
uh, wanted to say
that he has connections...

44:37.967 --> 44:39.927
at this hospital, and it's a...

44:40.010 --> 44:42.554
It's a state-of-the-art
kind of place, so...

44:44.139 --> 44:45.265
"Connections"?

44:48.560 --> 44:49.854
He owns it.

44:51.105 --> 44:52.898
[both chuckle]

44:56.276 --> 44:57.862
[Misty chuckles]

44:58.904 --> 45:00.155
Maybe they can help.

45:01.991 --> 45:03.408
Get you back up and running.

45:06.245 --> 45:07.246
Maybe.

45:10.750 --> 45:11.751
We'll see.

45:20.384 --> 45:21.927
[mellow music playing]

45:31.395 --> 45:32.687
What are you having?

45:32.772 --> 45:35.399
[scoffs] My fourth.

45:39.486 --> 45:40.654
What are you doing here?

45:41.947 --> 45:44.574
Just came to see how you're holding up.

45:46.618 --> 45:47.953
You didn't have to do that.

45:48.913 --> 45:49.914
I know.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.585
It's been a hell of a week. [sighs]

45:56.796 --> 45:59.339
Yeah. I had it with you.

46:03.093 --> 46:04.303
[Jessica sighs]

46:08.265 --> 46:09.558
I don't know what to say.

46:11.685 --> 46:14.855
Nothing that I don't need to say myself.

46:19.026 --> 46:21.403
After what happened between us...

46:23.572 --> 46:27.284
we both could've handled it differently.

46:29.036 --> 46:34.458
Instead, the Earth had to shake for us
to find each other again.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.635
What I did to you was...

46:48.597 --> 46:49.598
I know.

46:51.016 --> 46:53.518
But... we have to move forward.

46:56.563 --> 47:00.985
[sighs] What happened at Midland Circle
could've gone another way.

47:02.402 --> 47:04.029
It could've been either one of us...

47:04.822 --> 47:08.408
lying dead in the bottom of that hole.

47:09.409 --> 47:10.702
I just came to say...

47:12.787 --> 47:13.788
that I'm really...

47:15.207 --> 47:17.376
really glad it wasn't you.

47:37.396 --> 47:38.397
[sighs]

47:39.273 --> 47:40.690
Try stayin' in touch, Jess.

47:42.276 --> 47:43.360
You got friends.

47:45.404 --> 47:47.656
One of 'em is in Harlem.

47:52.119 --> 47:54.914
Yeah, maybe we'll grab a coffee
sometime or something.

48:09.970 --> 48:12.056
[train passing in distance]

48:16.893 --> 48:18.395
[door unlocking]

48:20.230 --> 48:21.315
[sighs]

48:27.821 --> 48:28.948
How is she?

48:30.699 --> 48:31.866
She's, uh...

48:33.118 --> 48:35.120
[chuckles softly] strong.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.041
How are you?

48:43.420 --> 48:44.921
[sighs]

48:45.005 --> 48:46.215
You, uh...

48:49.969 --> 48:52.512
[sighs] You still thinking
about Matt Murdock?

48:56.767 --> 48:58.143
[Danny] He loved this city.

49:02.022 --> 49:03.898
Sacrificed himself to protect it.

49:06.110 --> 49:07.444
Yeah.

49:10.114 --> 49:12.199
Look, I know you, Danny.

49:13.033 --> 49:15.785
You are finding some way
to beat yourself up about this.

49:21.625 --> 49:22.751
In K'un-Lun, they...

49:24.544 --> 49:27.672
they taught me
that there's a lesson in every tragedy.

49:29.299 --> 49:31.218
And even while experiencing pain...

49:32.010 --> 49:36.223
there's an opportunity to grow
and find clarity.

49:38.475 --> 49:39.476
Hmm.

49:41.395 --> 49:42.979
Anything becoming clear?

49:45.774 --> 49:46.775
New York.

49:51.321 --> 49:52.989
It's starting to feel like home.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.161
[both chuckle]

50:04.459 --> 50:05.627
[chuckles softly]

50:09.506 --> 50:10.632
[elevator bell dings]

50:38.535 --> 50:39.536
I, uh...

50:40.495 --> 50:42.997
figured I should probably get good
at covering up bullet holes.

50:43.957 --> 50:44.958
What do you think?

50:48.002 --> 50:49.213
I don't hate it.

50:50.338 --> 50:52.424
It's almost like you're back in business.

50:53.508 --> 50:54.551
Yeah, almost.

51:23.955 --> 51:25.665
[Karen crying]

51:48.230 --> 51:49.273
How you doin'?

51:50.232 --> 51:52.651
Yeah, okay. [sniffles]

51:52.734 --> 51:55.862
-How's the story coming?
-Oh, no, it... it's not.

51:56.863 --> 51:59.783
I mean, if I reveal what happened
at Midland Circle, then...

51:59.866 --> 52:03.119
all it takes is someone
like me figuring out...

52:05.330 --> 52:06.706
[chuckles softly]

52:06.790 --> 52:09.584
Superhero and lawyer
go missing at the same time.

52:10.710 --> 52:11.711
Right.

52:12.837 --> 52:17.050
I can't shake this feeling, like it's...
like it's not real.

52:18.802 --> 52:20.094
Or...

52:20.178 --> 52:23.682
Or even if it is, like, it's not over,
because they're still digging, right?

52:23.765 --> 52:26.185
-Karen, it's been days.
-[stammering] Maybe he made it out.

52:27.227 --> 52:28.228
Maybe...

52:29.145 --> 52:30.146
Maybe.

52:35.902 --> 52:37.821
-Sit with me?
-Of course.

52:45.454 --> 52:46.538
[Karen sighs]

52:55.797 --> 52:58.217
[police siren blaring in distance]

53:29.748 --> 53:30.790
[nun] Get Maggie.

53:36.755 --> 53:37.922
Tell her he's awake.

55:13.184 --> 55:15.228
[muffled grunting]

55:18.023 --> 55:19.316
[Frank Castle]
All the things that I'd done...

55:21.985 --> 55:23.236
[grunts]

55:26.239 --> 55:27.115
Memories...

55:27.657 --> 55:28.908
they never hurt me.

55:28.992 --> 55:30.535
[grunts]

55:32.370 --> 55:33.747
But the past...

55:34.664 --> 55:36.249
it's more than memories.

55:38.126 --> 55:40.128
It's the devil you sold your soul to.

55:45.258 --> 55:46.384
He's coming...

55:47.886 --> 55:49.054
[Frank grunts]

55:55.643 --> 55:57.520
He's coming to collect.
