00:32.380 --> 00:36.080
Why don't we see ghosts everyday?

00:36.080 --> 00:39.920
The truth is: ghosts are
around us all the time.

00:39.920 --> 00:44.680
But most hauntings are so
small, they go unnoticed.

00:44.680 --> 00:52.280
For exemple: a pen. A pen lid. A gravel.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.400
A trapped sound.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.640
A child ball. Or balls.

00:59.640 --> 01:03.640
A wheeled bin.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.880
Hello, I'm Vincent Dooley.

01:06.920 --> 01:12.320
Welcome to the next in my series exploring
the rare and wonderful supernatural gifts

01:12.400 --> 01:16.240
known as, the talents.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.160
Later, in this episode:

01:22.200 --> 01:25.160
Do you ever have nightmares
after eating cheese?

01:25.160 --> 01:27.160
You might've eaten a ghost.

01:27.160 --> 01:30.520
Even the weakest ghosts
can posses cheese quite easily!

01:30.520 --> 01:34.160
Due to the living bacteria,
in the cheese.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.560
But what is a ghost?

01:37.560 --> 01:41.000
Well, they were once just like us.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.840
I'm really sorry for murdering you daddy.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.840
You stop, will ya?

02:01.480 --> 02:04.360
You didn't murder him, you spanner,
it was literally an accident.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.880
What do they call it
when you kill your father, anyway?

02:13.520 --> 02:14.880
Dad slaughter?

02:16.760 --> 02:17.960
C'mon.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.560
I'm really sorry for
slaughtering you, daddy.

02:23.920 --> 02:26.080
C'mon sis, you're gonna be late for work.

03:27.420 --> 03:29.930
- Oh, we're flying along here.
- Yeah.

03:29.940 --> 03:31.990
- That's grand, isn't it?
- That's.. Not so hard.

03:32.010 --> 03:33.020
Yeah.

03:33.810 --> 03:36.460
- I wouldn't get cocky, but...
- Yeah.

03:37.680 --> 03:41.780
No, there's nothing at all to worry about,
just listen to the soothing sound of my voice.

03:42.310 --> 03:44.280
- Shit!
- Oh, mind your language.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.280
- Sorry, sorry.
- C'mon

03:46.280 --> 03:48.650
Go ahead.. Into first.

03:49.470 --> 03:52.160
Ah, don-Don't bring down
the, eh, you just...

03:53.200 --> 03:55.070
And are you up to something, tonight?

03:55.410 --> 03:58.640
Eh, hum, en-I'm engaged, actually, so...

03:59.380 --> 04:00.750
No, you're fine.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.290
That wasn't... I was just making

04:02.300 --> 04:04.420
driver instructor conversation.

04:04.420 --> 04:07.070
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, I have zero interest there.

04:39.590 --> 04:41.580
No one, I'm home!

04:45.310 --> 04:47.310
Miss you, paps. Miss you, Mary Black.

04:57.370 --> 05:00.540
What's going on in here, today...

05:00.940 --> 05:04.450
Ah, lasagna! Oh! Che cosa?

05:07.600 --> 05:10.020
I didn't really have any breakfast, so...

05:12.020 --> 05:14.080
I love this tart.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.000
Hi! This is Rose's Driving School.

05:27.040 --> 05:30.400
If you're calling about driving lessons,
please leave a message.

05:30.410 --> 05:33.380
If you're calling about the other thing
I haven't done that for years ok?

05:33.390 --> 05:34.920
So, just leave me alone.

05:35.530 --> 05:37.630
Hello? I hear you talk to the ghosts,

05:37.630 --> 05:39.850
there's something haunting in me green bin,

05:39.850 --> 05:42.860
Can you come up and take a look?
I've been driven bloody mad!

05:44.610 --> 05:46.440
Yeah, so, I lost my charger.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.080
Could you just use you powers
when going to find it?

05:49.080 --> 05:51.550
And also, maybe have a look
to see if I'm pregnant?

05:51.730 --> 05:53.010
Oh my god!

05:53.230 --> 05:55.850
How hungry would you have
to be to eat your own baby?

05:56.530 --> 05:58.850
- It's desperate.
- A'ight, sis! It's Sailor

05:58.880 --> 06:01.520
hear me out, you better not
be up on that bouncy ball,

06:01.530 --> 06:03.550
eating yogurt and listening
to ghosts messages.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.460
After you're not gonna call over
at all, tonight's the same, just-

06:06.460 --> 06:08.460
So, now occurred to me,
my feet are killing me.

06:08.460 --> 06:12.010
So, you can have dinner on your own.
Lasagna for one, is it?

06:12.010 --> 06:14.010
All right, go on. I'll talk to you later.

06:14.010 --> 06:16.010
By-ye! I love you.

06:21.380 --> 06:24.340
Hello? Is this... Rose's Driving School?

06:25.790 --> 06:27.010
My name is Martin.

06:27.790 --> 06:29.010
Martin Martin.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.530
YOU MUST PAY

06:48.920 --> 06:50.990
THE CAR TAX

06:53.950 --> 06:55.610
Yeah, I remenber, but-

06:55.610 --> 06:57.610
Thanks, Bonnie.

06:58.410 --> 07:01.240
Dad! I'm bursting for a wee
and I'm really fucking late!

07:01.240 --> 07:04.840
- Language, Sarah!
- Fuck off, dad.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.240
Not that one, again!

07:26.480 --> 07:28.960
Sorry, Bonnie! I'll wear it!

07:40.360 --> 07:42.340
Stop it, Terry!

07:42.340 --> 07:44.160
Terry, that's disgusting!

07:49.480 --> 07:55.320
- Hmm, toast. Cool shirt, dad.
- The future of woodwork is uncertain.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.720
What happened?

08:00.400 --> 08:03.460
Oh! Nothing. I hit it off a door.

08:03.460 --> 08:05.460
It was mum again, wasn't it?

08:05.460 --> 08:06.520
No...

08:06.520 --> 08:09.920
- No.
- Don't lie, I can tell.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.580
YOur nose kinda twitches,
you're the world's worst lier.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.240
I push her buttons.

08:22.040 --> 08:25.040
Why are you still here, mum?
What do you want?!

08:25.040 --> 08:26.580
What's wrong with you, Terry?

08:26.620 --> 08:28.580
DOG HAS WORMS

08:29.480 --> 08:31.580
See? She's just trying to help.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.299
Sarah?

08:40.559 --> 08:42.100
- You smoking?
- Yeah.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.130
We can't go on like this.

08:47.130 --> 08:50.390
If you're too scared to do something,
than I'm gonna call someone.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.820
Who you're gonna call?

08:51.820 --> 08:54.920
Rose Dooley? that psychic
driving instructor or whatever...

08:54.920 --> 08:57.460
Those Dooleys? That family is mad!

08:57.800 --> 08:58.720
You know her?

08:58.720 --> 09:01.460
No, but I used to see
her father in the telly.

09:01.600 --> 09:05.200
Crazy fella, going on
about talking to ghosts.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.900
Right, crazy father talks to ghosts.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.940
Look, it Sarah,

09:12.940 --> 09:14.980
I don't know what I'm doing half the time

09:15.420 --> 09:19.480
Right? Your... Your mum is doing her thing
to stop me from messing this all up.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.780
- Dad...
- What if I do it wrong

09:20.790 --> 09:24.460
and you end up some sort of a
homeless, sex maniac?

09:24.470 --> 09:26.810
Sleeping on the streets, snorting a hash!

09:27.140 --> 09:30.040
Jesus, dad! If you're not gonna call her
or do something

09:30.040 --> 09:32.040
I'm movieng out!

09:36.410 --> 09:37.760
That's my lift.

09:56.860 --> 10:00.010
Hello? Is this... Rose's Driving School?

10:02.010 --> 10:03.160
My name is Martin.

10:04.220 --> 10:05.220
Martin Martin.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.320
Hello!

10:23.890 --> 10:25.680
Hi! Eh... Rose, isn't it?

10:26.240 --> 10:29.460
Yeah, but you know what they say-
a Rose by any other name.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.880
Oh, Sorry!
So, is it Rose?

10:31.880 --> 10:33.970
O- or do you go by another name, isn't it?

10:33.970 --> 10:35.970
No, sorry, no, it is Rose.

10:35.970 --> 10:38.810
Sorry, it's just like a
cool thing that Roses say.

10:38.810 --> 10:40.530
But, uhm...

10:41.100 --> 10:42.530
Hi, Rose here!

10:44.630 --> 10:46.040
Sorry. Oh my god!

10:48.570 --> 10:50.580
Bloody thing is, demented.

10:50.630 --> 10:52.640
Uhm, hi Rose, I'm Martin.

10:53.530 --> 10:55.370
Ok, should we get started?

10:56.730 --> 10:59.990
I've brought some toast sandwiches,
I wans't sure how long we'd be...

10:59.990 --> 11:01.090
Oh! Ok...

11:02.340 --> 11:05.620
And a... Couple of little juices.

11:07.090 --> 11:08.250
Lovely, is it eh?

11:10.840 --> 11:12.310
- So...
- Ah, and some mints!

11:13.910 --> 11:15.260
In case of...

11:16.230 --> 11:18.180
Onions, in the-in the sandwich.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.540
- The breaths in the car, you know?
- Right.

11:21.530 --> 11:22.680
So, uhm...

11:23.000 --> 11:24.650
One thing is, I think, I-

11:24.650 --> 11:27.620
You do look like a "cool dude",
with those sunglasses, but I think

11:27.630 --> 11:30.660
for driving, it might be even
better if you don't actually... No!

11:30.660 --> 11:35.340
No no, no. I need them, they're
hm, special prescription.

11:35.830 --> 11:37.270
All right.

11:37.270 --> 11:39.520
Ok so, should we get it going?

11:42.510 --> 11:46.950
Now you have nothing at all to worry about,
just listen to the soothing sound of my voice

11:46.950 --> 11:50.580
and we pop the key into the ignition,
very good.

11:50.580 --> 11:52.770
Indicate we're out, pull over.

11:52.770 --> 11:56.240
Yeah, excellent! Oh, you just...
Flying there Martin.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.970
Very good.

12:04.730 --> 12:07.880
Sometimes, it's just
easy to teach, you know?

12:08.920 --> 12:10.620
That's just fine.

12:10.620 --> 12:12.940
You don't have-you barely
have to do anything.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.770
So now this is called "parallel parking".

12:17.290 --> 12:18.940
And you're doing very well there...

12:18.940 --> 12:21.800
Yeah, look behind you
and look afront here.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.750
Brilliant!

12:25.970 --> 12:27.460
That's fantastic, Martin!

12:27.480 --> 12:30.050
I would say that you are
nearly ready for your test!

12:30.180 --> 12:32.310
I've passed my test seventeen years ago.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.400
What?

12:33.750 --> 12:35.570
Rose I haven't been honest with you.

12:36.060 --> 12:37.620
You did want the other juice?

12:38.240 --> 12:41.160
No, I... I didn't really come
to you for a driving lesson.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.250
Oh my god, you're an external examiner?
Let me just say

12:45.260 --> 12:48.240
that thing about the mirrors I was
only messing, you do need to use them.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.620
I was going to just do a lesson and pretend
to my daughter that I'd asked for help

12:51.620 --> 12:54.090
and that you'd said no-
- Wait! Ask me for help?

12:54.090 --> 12:55.680
With what?

12:55.680 --> 12:57.210
With my wife.

12:57.450 --> 12:59.890
Oh, your wife? She can't drive is it?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.240
No, my <i>deceased</i> wife.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.730
I knew this was going too well.

13:07.110 --> 13:10.710
Uhm, I'm a driving instructor
and you're perfectly capable of driving

13:10.710 --> 13:12.780
so please exit my vehicle, thank you.

13:12.900 --> 13:15.420
I knew, this whole thing was a bad idea.

13:15.840 --> 13:16.840
I'm sorry.

13:20.370 --> 13:22.800
Martin?! Did your wife
do that to your face?

13:22.800 --> 13:25.600
It's just a-Ai eh...
It's just a bump.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.410
Bonnie said, if I'd put some
frozen peas on it it would-

13:28.410 --> 13:30.570
Wait! You can hear her when she speaks?

13:30.800 --> 13:31.900
Yeah, why?

13:32.580 --> 13:34.440
- Never mind.
- It's just, you're so nice

13:34.440 --> 13:37.370
to talk to, you seem like a warm person.

13:38.340 --> 13:40.380
You seem really nice as well.

13:41.130 --> 13:44.730
And maybe you could have a chat with
my wife, you know, woman to woman?

13:44.760 --> 13:47.350
Use your gift just to find
out what's up with her.

13:47.350 --> 13:49.330
I don't use my talents anymore.

13:49.330 --> 13:51.720
I swore I would never again,
they're too dangerous.

13:51.730 --> 13:54.050
Then maybe with my daughter
Sarah, then, tell her-

13:54.050 --> 13:56.290
Tell her that this ghost stuff is normal?

13:56.290 --> 13:57.370
I said no!

14:02.110 --> 14:05.350
I understand, uhm...
Sorry for bothering you.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.910
Goodbye Rose.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.840
He said I'm warm.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.840
Do ghosts have feelings?

14:23.840 --> 14:28.110
Ghosts, like us, can be lonely.

14:28.110 --> 14:34.550
Stuck between worlds, they spend what little
energy they have trying to get people's attention

14:34.860 --> 14:38.910
- Ugh, leave me alone.
- But try as they might,

14:38.910 --> 14:43.310
it's hard for them to make
any real impact in our world.

14:45.310 --> 14:47.240
Stop waving at me, Brant!

14:47.250 --> 14:52.960
Generally most people tend to think
that ghosts are something to be afraid of.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.370
Really, they are just people.

14:57.540 --> 15:01.170
Maybe, we could help them to move on.

15:05.650 --> 15:11.220
These are stuck people. Lonely people.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.510
Ordinary people.

15:21.020 --> 15:25.080
There's no doubt that Ireland
has its fare share of musicians.

15:25.080 --> 15:29.970
But there are also many who have moved here
from abroad, and now call Ireland home.

15:29.970 --> 15:37.970
<i>♪ And I sing, la lalalala!
Cosmic woman, lalalala, cosmic woman ♪</i>

15:40.740 --> 15:46.280
And, what was it about Ireland that made
you want to move here, twenty years ago?

15:47.650 --> 15:50.140
I was seeking solitude.

15:50.140 --> 15:57.800
Ireland is steeped in the poetic, mystical,
magic. The people are, uhm, are simple people.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.140
Yes.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.140
Yeah, and all that tax
exemption, of course.

16:02.220 --> 16:09.170
<i>♪ And I sing, la lalalala!
Cosmic woman lalalala, cosmic woman ♪</i>

16:09.190 --> 16:12.960
Few songs in rock history
had such instant success.

16:12.960 --> 16:19.880
Christian shot from anonymity to mega stardom,
practically over night. But that was it.

16:20.400 --> 16:24.720
A one hit wonder. Christians
success, was short lived.

16:24.720 --> 16:28.450
None of his subsequent records
even made it to the chats.

16:28.450 --> 16:33.250
Yes. Everyone does call him one hit <i>winter</i>
and laughs at him, etc.

16:33.600 --> 16:38.750
But, this new album is really gonna turn things
around and we won't have to live in this shi-

16:38.750 --> 16:42.670
Eh! Deh-d-This is, my comeback.

16:42.670 --> 16:50.500
They say that "the devil is in the details', and
with this album-Aww, the details are just right.

16:51.870 --> 16:57.550
In the eyes of the media, the only thing cool
about this Winter are his banks accounts.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.270
And reports are they are now, all, frozen.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.750
She promised me she wouldn't mention it!

17:04.750 --> 17:07.000
This is why I never do interviews anymore.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.700
Aah! And now I've misspelled Beelzebub!

17:10.700 --> 17:12.700
Christie, darling, the phone's ringing!

17:14.700 --> 17:17.450
Phone! Now Christian, it's your manager.

17:17.900 --> 17:24.099
Bernard, old friend! We're in the final
stages here, it's all been surprisingly easy.

17:24.099 --> 17:30.070
I did the incantation to summon the chosen
girl, and as if by, well, magic - she arrived!

17:30.070 --> 17:33.550
The books power is really quite impressive.

17:41.920 --> 17:45.700
Of course, after the sacrifice
I'll send you the new album.

17:45.700 --> 17:49.100
Oh, I can't wait to be back on top! Yes!

17:49.120 --> 17:51.750
With the hit songs and money too!

17:51.770 --> 17:57.470
Yeah, is all in my uh-my list.

17:57.470 --> 18:01.420
No! I don't want my legs broken... again.

18:01.450 --> 18:03.220
Hey you, wake up!

18:04.770 --> 18:06.470
Oh gosh...

18:06.870 --> 18:14.850
Bernie? I-I think I must go. Yes, I need to
do some m <i>astering.</i> See you at the Grammys!

18:15.900 --> 18:18.220
- Cl-Claudia...
- Sorry!

18:18.250 --> 18:19.250
God!

18:23.320 --> 18:25.670
Ooh! The virgin!

18:26.030 --> 18:30.190
Claudia! What in god's green
under garments did you do?

18:30.220 --> 18:35.640
What? I woke her up to ask her something and
she kinda exploded and sorta fell apart...

18:35.640 --> 18:37.310
It'll still work, yeah?

18:37.310 --> 18:39.310
I just sacrificed her a bit early.

18:39.310 --> 18:42.930
The blood moon is tomorrow night,
the ceremony can only happen then!

18:42.930 --> 18:45.350
Now I shall have to procure another virgin!

18:46.020 --> 18:48.020
I said, sorry!

18:55.000 --> 18:58.040
The virgin divination
rod, have you seen it?

18:58.040 --> 19:01.480
There's an ornate phallice
carved into one end.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.480
Oh, the willy stick.

19:05.640 --> 19:11.960
Darling? Please be more respectful of
my things! Seven hundred years old.

19:14.360 --> 19:18.680
Now, once operational it always
points in the direction of purity.

19:18.680 --> 19:22.200
Let e do a quick incantation to turn it on.

19:33.880 --> 19:34.880
Babe?

19:38.510 --> 19:39.910
Babe?

19:45.250 --> 19:46.310
Babe!

19:46.940 --> 19:47.910
Christian!

19:47.910 --> 19:49.310
- What now my sweet?

19:49.370 --> 19:53.080
- Uhm, maybe you should wait till your
closer to town to turn your dick rod on?

19:55.420 --> 19:58.620
Yes, good Idea. Yes.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.310
And that's them leaving the church.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.680
And that's the flowers, aren't they lovely?

20:20.140 --> 20:23.220
Yeah and...
That's the family together.

20:24.310 --> 20:27.770
All dressed up...
Yeah, I didn't know the woman.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.200
It was a brilliant funeral.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.480
Shall we?

20:32.080 --> 20:33.910
Oh, Rose! I didn't recognize you.

20:34.180 --> 20:35.600
You'd been putting on some weight.

20:36.250 --> 20:37.730
Yeah? Thank you!

20:38.240 --> 20:39.560
You pregnant too?

20:39.610 --> 20:40.050
No!

20:40.280 --> 20:42.210
- An unmarried mother like your sister-
- All right!

20:42.210 --> 20:43.030
Go on so, Noreen!

20:43.050 --> 20:45.380
That should do you for six weeks now,
no need to see you again, all right?

20:45.380 --> 20:46.860
That's on the count, bye!

20:48.090 --> 20:49.960
- You all right?
- Fucking fusser...

20:51.080 --> 20:52.390
- Blowjob?
- Yes!

20:52.390 --> 20:54.390
Actually, I rather need one.

20:54.390 --> 20:56.390
- So, I have a date!
- What?

20:56.390 --> 20:58.390
- Your man from the butcher?
- No!

20:58.390 --> 21:01.120
You know Brian Welsh, the
guy from the county counsel?

21:01.120 --> 21:03.730
Where they put the cash machine downtown?

21:04.040 --> 21:05.730
He's a bit dull maybe, Butcher.

21:05.900 --> 21:08.600
That's good though, you know?
'Cause he won't be too giddy.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.110
Rose, is giddy your way
of saying sexually active?

21:11.530 --> 21:13.110
I think so yeah, yeah!

21:13.110 --> 21:14.220
Anyway, listen!

21:14.300 --> 21:18.890
Noreen's just saying to me there that Christie
Berk's wife has gone to jail for infanticide,

21:18.890 --> 21:21.340
so he's practically single now.
And no kids or nothing.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.500
Just thinking you should
call up and see him!

21:23.530 --> 21:25.160
No... Thank you, though!

21:25.510 --> 21:28.820
But, I think th-I think I
might have met someone, maybe?

21:29.610 --> 21:30.610
Wait...

21:31.050 --> 21:32.050
What?

21:32.520 --> 21:37.520
I'm not sure bu this gentleman,
like, Martin. Martin Martin,

21:37.520 --> 21:41.050
When we touched, something...
There was something, all right?

21:41.200 --> 21:42.560
I don't know, but

21:42.600 --> 21:45.750
he was only pretending that he
couldn't drive so he could talk to me.

21:45.750 --> 21:48.290
Oh my goo! Pretending is good, go Martin!

21:48.380 --> 21:49.960
So, what did he want to talk about?

21:49.960 --> 21:53.190
Oh, his wife, like
she's dead but she still lives with him.

21:53.190 --> 21:55.190
Oh, for fuck's sake, one of them?

21:55.850 --> 21:57.190
But that's an easy fix, no?

21:57.190 --> 21:58.450
Quick <i>ex-wifexorcism</i>!

21:58.970 --> 21:59.970
Sailor!

22:00.420 --> 22:01.860
You know I can't do that!

22:01.860 --> 22:03.690
Why Rose, what's the worst that can happen?

22:03.690 --> 22:08.220
Aah, I kill him with my supernatural powers
living his daughter to face her live alone?

22:08.530 --> 22:09.530
Fair enough.

22:10.290 --> 22:13.410
Well right, tell me, did you like, kiss?
Oh my god, did anything giddy happen?

22:13.420 --> 22:15.590
No! Oh my god, no!

22:15.850 --> 22:18.660
- I thought maybe something could, but-
- Yeah?

22:19.140 --> 22:20.710
I don't know, he just-

22:20.790 --> 22:23.520
He was crying and I told him
like "get out of my car"!

22:23.590 --> 22:26.010
And then I ate a sandwich that he left.

22:26.230 --> 22:27.660
And then I started crying too.

22:28.610 --> 22:29.610
Wow.

22:30.410 --> 22:32.780
You should be a <i>sexpert</i> on
one of those magazines, Rose.

22:32.780 --> 22:34.290
Sailor, is that how advice's like?

22:36.100 --> 22:37.100
All right, sorry.

22:37.670 --> 22:40.150
Well, why don't you get to know him a bit?

22:40.150 --> 22:41.480
See if he's into you?

22:41.760 --> 22:43.480
Like, just like that sorta thing?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Would you call him?

22:45.200 --> 22:47.360
Oh no! I have a better
idea actually, stalk him!

22:47.600 --> 22:48.600
Stalk him?

22:48.600 --> 22:52.240
Rose, I do it all the time!
How do you think I found about Brian ♪♪♪♪?

22:52.970 --> 22:54.210
I would never do that.

23:13.450 --> 23:15.140
With you in a sec.

23:15.910 --> 23:18.110
I'm just browsing, young lady!

23:18.910 --> 23:23.140
So Rose, if that is her real name,
said she doesn't do it anymore.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.140
- Fuck's sake....
- Language!

23:25.280 --> 23:27.940
She jus refused to help? Bitch.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.740
Don't be mean!

23:30.020 --> 23:31.480
She seemed nice.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.510
A bit weird.

23:35.400 --> 23:39.020
Nice weird, I suppose.
At least she didn't think I was nuts.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.710
Felt good to-To talk about it.

23:43.340 --> 23:45.770
You know, to somebody else. Who understood.

23:46.340 --> 23:48.200
Ok, well, it's a start.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.650
No more excuses.

23:49.650 --> 23:52.020
It's me or mum, seriously!

23:52.020 --> 23:54.400
I'll talk to your mother,
see what I can do.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.800
Aha! Your girl's got something.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.400
The fragrant aroma of purity.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.730
I just remembered I have a mop, thanks!

24:27.400 --> 24:29.780
Oh my god! Hi! Christian Winter!

24:29.780 --> 24:32.440
- Hello?
- Oh my god, I'm am such a fan!

24:32.440 --> 24:33.440
Thank you.

24:33.780 --> 24:34.780
Yes.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.060
Willy... Oh!

24:39.060 --> 24:42.860
Will he or won't he release a new
album soon, we all want to know.

24:43.620 --> 24:45.750
'Cause I loved "Cosmic Woman"!
Stunning.

24:45.790 --> 24:47.100
Thank you, thank you, yes.

24:47.100 --> 24:51.740
- But it was so long ago, I'd love to hear some, something...
- Very soon!

24:51.740 --> 24:54.360
Believe me! Working on it, right now.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.360
Oh, cool! Ok!

24:56.360 --> 24:57.730
By-ye!

25:09.030 --> 25:10.500
Can I help you or something?

25:11.140 --> 25:12.890
Oh yes, my dear.

25:13.570 --> 25:15.330
I believe you can.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.680
What is evil?

25:25.480 --> 25:30.740
Well, there are those who would use their
knowledge of magic for nefarious purposes.

25:31.540 --> 25:36.570
Power. Fortune. Fame.

25:39.570 --> 25:43.080
Behold this...! Uh...

25:43.850 --> 25:45.650
Scrunchie...!

25:50.170 --> 25:52.000
Hair of the virgin.

25:53.020 --> 25:55.650
Bonnie? You there?

25:57.370 --> 25:58.740
Come on love.

25:59.620 --> 26:01.250
We need a chat!

26:11.400 --> 26:14.940
God almighty, Bonnie!
One is not gonna kill me.

26:16.310 --> 26:18.400
There's no need for that!

26:18.450 --> 26:22.110
The spells they cast are
not incantations for luck!

26:22.110 --> 26:24.110
Or good harvests.

26:24.110 --> 26:29.970
They're more like bargains, struck
with dark, ancient and hungry spirits.

26:30.510 --> 26:35.910
Evil spirits, whose help comes...
With a price.

26:38.310 --> 26:39.450
Sarah!

26:46.660 --> 26:48.860
Babe, dinner!

26:50.000 --> 26:52.060
It's Good Johnson's chips!

26:52.260 --> 26:56.130
Coming my sweet! I'm doing an incantation.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.800
Now!

26:58.730 --> 27:03.860
This better work... Or it's
curtains for Christian.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.000
<font size="34" face="Chiller">Hello?</font>

27:19.480 --> 27:23.000
No, I'm sorry! It is Rose, sorry,
I just had a frog in my throat.

27:23.480 --> 27:24.480
What?

27:25.440 --> 27:28.720
Can you slow down? Yeah!
Of course I remember you.

27:30.720 --> 27:33.640
No, I told you, I don't do that anymor-

27:34.880 --> 27:38.880
Martin? Don't do anything, all right?
I'm on my way over now.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.790
Why did you slaughter me, Rose?

28:22.220 --> 28:23.400
Telly's back.

28:29.020 --> 28:30.020
Buy mommy.

28:31.450 --> 28:33.240
Yes, ok Rose, you can do this!

28:33.490 --> 28:36.090
Just go over there, save the girl.

28:36.090 --> 28:37.980
Don't slaughter anybody again, and uhm-

28:38.620 --> 28:40.820
Fall in love, get the guy.

28:40.830 --> 28:43.550
And then be home in time to something
to eat, maybe something light

28:43.550 --> 28:45.600
just yogurt or something!

28:53.320 --> 28:54.320
Hello.

28:55.600 --> 28:56.750
Bonnie!

28:59.210 --> 29:01.090
I'm guessing that was more
than just a gust of wind.

29:01.090 --> 29:02.690
- Yeah, sorry.
- No, it's ok.

29:02.690 --> 29:04.810
Hi Bonnie! Uhm
My name is Rose.

29:05.330 --> 29:06.810
Pleased to meet you. Ok.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.000
Sarah is, upstairs?

29:09.000 --> 29:11.460
Good. Ah! Those are bad luck.

29:44.180 --> 29:45.790
Oh Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

29:45.790 --> 29:48.130
Martin, she's floating!
She's floating, Martin!

29:48.130 --> 29:50.690
I know, told ya! Rose, what is this?

29:50.690 --> 29:53.040
I don't know, I was trying to stay calm
there on the door but, uhm-

29:53.040 --> 29:55.040
I'm in way over my head. I gotta go.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.040
No, Rose, please!

29:57.040 --> 29:59.040
Please, I don't hav
anybody else to turn to!

29:59.040 --> 30:01.040
Please. Look at her.

30:03.680 --> 30:04.700
Could it be Bonnie?

30:04.870 --> 30:06.830
I shouldn't have tried to eat that donut!

30:06.830 --> 30:08.830
I push her buttons, you know?

30:09.230 --> 30:13.200
Yeah, but I don't think that this is Bonnie, I
mean-Why would she do this to her own daughter?

30:13.380 --> 30:15.330
It's true, she never bothers Sarah.

30:15.330 --> 30:19.860
Plus, like, with possession there's
usually more vomiting and funny voices and-

30:19.860 --> 30:22.460
Masturbating with crucifixes, and...

30:22.750 --> 30:25.230
- You know, like that sort of thing anyway.
- Like the Exorcist?

30:25.230 --> 30:26.280
I've never met him.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.440
Then... What is happening?

30:30.930 --> 30:32.910
Well... I do have an idea.

30:33.490 --> 30:34.610
I really hope I'm wrong.

30:46.760 --> 30:49.090
Hello! I'm Vincent Dooley.

30:49.440 --> 30:53.200
This week, I'm visiting the
O'Callaghan farm, in West Cork.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.490
Investigating a <i>gloating.</i>

30:55.490 --> 30:58.150
- <i>Gloating</i> ?
- Yeah, a goat floating.

30:58.790 --> 31:01.730
- Right. Ok, I see.
- Uhm, Martin?

31:02.310 --> 31:07.520
Do you think you can kinda be like, calm, and
like-Do you remember that cool guy in the car?

31:10.240 --> 31:12.920
Just to let you know
this is a satanic ritual.

31:12.980 --> 31:16.760
Satanists? Oh my god!
Don't they I should've had her baptized?

31:16.760 --> 31:19.680
This is a preparation
for a virgin sacrifice.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.940
What? Like-

31:22.560 --> 31:23.700
Bang a goat?

31:24.260 --> 31:29.940
Yeah, like, some demons are into that you know,
just different strokes but, uhm, listen-

31:30.720 --> 31:33.010
Only in eve of the Blood Moon,

31:33.010 --> 31:37.080
the virgin's body will float
to when the spell was originally cast.

31:37.520 --> 31:42.920
The Blood Moon! Th-th-the weather woman was on
about that. It's a weird lunar eclipse thing-

31:42.920 --> 31:44.920
She said it was tomorrow night!

31:45.620 --> 31:48.140
- Sarah!
- Martin, no, no! No-

31:48.160 --> 31:50.040
- You can't wake her!
- Why not?

31:50.410 --> 31:52.460
You can never wake a floating goat.

31:52.810 --> 31:54.250
Watch this.

31:57.570 --> 31:58.960
Martin! Stop!

31:58.960 --> 32:00.960
Stop screaming! <i>Shhh</i>

32:01.050 --> 32:02.570
I'll help you, ok?

32:02.570 --> 32:07.340
I know this holding spell, okay?
I've got some herbs-

32:07.680 --> 32:09.460
Just be calm! Martin?

32:09.460 --> 32:11.460
This is gonna keep her safe, ok?

32:11.460 --> 32:15.780
So it's mainly rue and sage aand...!

32:15.780 --> 32:17.000
That's the holding spell!

32:17.000 --> 32:19.200
Do you have any fresh basil and tabasco?

32:19.970 --> 32:20.970
What do they do?

32:22.350 --> 32:25.600
I bought this frozen pizza,
and was hoping you could kind pimp it?

32:25.970 --> 32:27.020
I'm starving.

32:29.700 --> 32:31.650
And now, we wait.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.820
What a shit hole.

32:41.820 --> 32:43.820
I got it! We need ectoplasm.

32:43.820 --> 32:47.870
It's this type of goo that ghosts leave behind
when they move out to the spirit world.

32:47.870 --> 32:49.140
Like in Ghostbusters!

32:49.140 --> 32:50.160
Oh, I haven't read that!

32:50.820 --> 32:52.280
Ok, so, to break the spell-

32:52.280 --> 32:56.200
We basically have to collect the ectoplasm of seven
ghosts and rub that into your daughter's face.

32:56.910 --> 32:58.850
Kinda of unnecessarily gross, isn't it?

32:58.850 --> 33:01.230
No, it's just like
technical paranormal stuff.

33:01.340 --> 33:03.520
'Course it would sound weird
for like, a lay person.

33:03.960 --> 33:08.060
Ok, that's not so bad!
We just go get some ectoplasm.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.620
Martin?

33:09.650 --> 33:12.650
You know the other day
you were saying that you could hear Bonnie?

33:13.350 --> 33:15.050
Yeah, yes, I can sometimes.

33:15.050 --> 33:17.050
Do you now that that's a really rare gift?

33:17.050 --> 33:19.050
- That's called a <i>talent</i>.
- That's my talent?

33:19.120 --> 33:19.770
Uhum.

33:19.770 --> 33:22.420
Why couldn't I be good at
something cool like D <i>Jing?</i>

33:22.450 --> 33:23.620
It is cool!

33:23.620 --> 33:24.920
That was my dad's talent too!

33:24.950 --> 33:26.800
That's how come we could
work together, you know?

33:26.800 --> 33:31.970
He could hear ghosts, they spoke through him, and
my talent is basically like chatting to them?

33:32.020 --> 33:33.620
An that's what made us such a good team.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.050
What, so you were on his tv show?

33:36.050 --> 33:38.050
Yeah... I don't like watching those ones.

33:45.620 --> 33:47.850
Sorry Bonnie! Totally my fault.

33:48.270 --> 33:50.570
Put a plate where the bowls are.

33:51.220 --> 33:55.920
N-now! Where are we gonna find a ghost
to get this <i> ecto</i> stuff?

33:55.920 --> 33:57.350
Where are we gonna find a ghost?

33:57.350 --> 33:59.350
Martin? Right.

33:59.350 --> 34:03.620
You just have to let the ghosts inhabit your
body and I can do all the rest, all right?

34:03.620 --> 34:06.300
It's basically exorcising her.

34:09.750 --> 34:12.800
Wait a minute. No way! Her?

34:13.250 --> 34:15.870
I mean, it makes sense and
also, don't you think it's time?

34:15.870 --> 34:17.500
That's my wife you're talking about!

34:17.500 --> 34:19.500
- Yeah, your dead wife.
- <i>Shh</i>

34:20.320 --> 34:22.699
She hates to be talked about.

34:22.699 --> 34:26.150
And some times, not be talked about.
She's a complicated woman!

34:26.420 --> 34:29.219
Theses spirits, right?
They're not themselves-

34:29.219 --> 34:32.409
We could be helping her,
all she needs is just like a little shove.

34:33.270 --> 34:35.280
You are not shoving my wife!

34:35.280 --> 34:38.080
I'm sorry, I would do
anything to help Sarah but-

34:38.080 --> 34:40.080
Killing my dead wife is not an option!

34:40.080 --> 34:43.139
Ok! So we just gonna have
to try to round some.

34:43.139 --> 34:45.139
Thank you, Rose!

34:45.679 --> 34:48.639
So, where on this little town
we're going to find seven ghosts?

34:49.219 --> 34:50.770
Well, actually...!

34:51.270 --> 34:53.590
You might be... Surprised.

34:54.070 --> 34:58.390
Hello. Rose Dooley? I've
been calling you for weeks!

35:08.220 --> 35:10.140
Why hasn't she floated ou?

35:10.140 --> 35:13.500
Christ, why we're waiting so long?
Can't we just kill the bitch?

35:13.760 --> 35:16.940
Claudia? I'm afraid
it doesn't work like that! that way, ok?

35:16.940 --> 35:19.420
The sacrifice is a trade, you see?

35:19.420 --> 35:21.700
A covenant between myself and the Dark One!

35:21.780 --> 35:22.780
And then?

35:23.480 --> 35:26.980
Yes. And then my darling
you'll have the riches you deserve.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.360
You put that <i>tubery </i> jape thing
I like on the Satan list?

35:33.300 --> 35:34.300
Wait!

35:34.380 --> 35:36.220
Look!

35:41.660 --> 35:43.800
♪♪♪♪

35:44.360 --> 35:49.110
There appears to be some sort
of holding spell on the virgin!

35:50.310 --> 35:52.960
The plot thickens!

35:52.960 --> 35:54.340
Can't we just kill the bitch?

35:54.390 --> 35:54.870
Just-

35:54.920 --> 35:57.440
No! O? They have the girl!

35:57.440 --> 36:01.570
A-and again! Killing the virgin
is pointless! It's a sacrifice.

36:01.570 --> 36:02.800
Been through this!

36:03.010 --> 36:07.220
Don't you get snippy with me! I'm this close
with you Christian, this fucking close!

36:07.220 --> 36:09.220
YOu think I don't understand sacrifices?

36:09.220 --> 36:11.990
I have put up with your
tragic magic for years!

36:11.990 --> 36:17.220
I have sacrificed all our royalties to get the
money to buy this fucking book, it better work!

36:17.220 --> 36:20.290
For it to work, we must pursue them!

36:20.290 --> 36:22.280
The Blood Moon grows ever closer!

36:22.280 --> 36:24.760
This bloody moon better
make you bloody rich!

36:25.120 --> 36:26.120
Yes...

36:42.840 --> 36:43.950
Nervous?

36:43.950 --> 36:47.190
Wel, I mean, I told you I'm basically
retired for a real long time, like so-

36:47.190 --> 36:50.510
I don't know if you need to get somebody
else I'm actually, really very rusty.

36:50.510 --> 36:51.870
I've been calling you for weeks!

36:51.870 --> 36:53.500
- This must be her!
- Oh!

36:53.820 --> 36:54.820
Hi.

37:00.850 --> 37:02.850
Do you have a problem
with the ghost, is it?

37:02.850 --> 37:04.390
I don't know if it's a ghost or what-

37:04.390 --> 37:07.230
But you see these here?
I've had to move them away from the house,

37:07.230 --> 37:09.010
They're driving the dog mental!

37:09.230 --> 37:10.230
Here. Let me show you.

37:12.250 --> 37:13.250
Holy shit!

37:30.020 --> 37:31.650
- Is everything ok?
- Yeah, good!

37:31.730 --> 37:33.320
Good, thanks, How are you?

37:33.490 --> 37:36.740
Martin, no! I absolutely can't do
this, like, this is-This is demented.

37:36.740 --> 37:38.740
I'm having a full on panic attack!
I'm freaking out-

37:38.740 --> 37:40.760
And you go there
and tell her I'm having a panic attack-

37:40.760 --> 37:42.760
I'mjust gonna try something.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.380
Hey! you need to get your
shit together, woman!

37:45.510 --> 37:46.510
What?

37:46.900 --> 37:49.380
Did you actually just
put on a "cool" voice?

37:49.380 --> 37:51.380
- And call me woman?
- Yes.

37:51.380 --> 37:55.800
Yes I did. And I- and I said shit, too!
I am so sorry!

37:55.910 --> 37:59.030
I was just trying to stop you from
freaking out, are you still freaking out?

38:00.070 --> 38:01.070
N-no.

38:01.880 --> 38:02.880
Ok, c'mon.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.560
Come on!

38:07.350 --> 38:10.950
Excuse us, Janet, we just had some technical
difficulties, but they are all sorted now!

38:11.080 --> 38:13.650
Could I ask if have you
lost anybody recently?

38:14.100 --> 38:16.280
My Tom passed a few months ago.

38:17.080 --> 38:18.210
I'm so sorry!

38:18.400 --> 38:19.400
I am not.

38:19.560 --> 38:20.560
Prick.

38:21.540 --> 38:23.010
Tell me this, uhm-

38:23.010 --> 38:25.920
Was Tom sorta responsible
for the rubbish and the recycling?

38:25.920 --> 38:26.800
Oh yeah.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.030
_ I wonder if he has something to do wi-
- <i>Me</i> Tom?

38:29.030 --> 38:30.230
Behind this?

38:30.230 --> 38:32.820
Well, I can't say but...

38:33.320 --> 38:34.520
- Tommy?
- Damnit.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.440
Do you hear me?

38:35.440 --> 38:37.570
I'll put you and the green bin in the lake!

38:37.720 --> 38:41.000
- Janet, I'm sorry, please.
There's absolutely no need to worry!
- What?

38:41.010 --> 38:44.020
I can take care of this,
it's a very straight forward procedure, ok?

38:45.110 --> 38:46.790
What are they spasmin' out about?

38:47.480 --> 38:48.520
Give me you hands.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.840
Seems to be some local
form of the Dark Arts!

38:53.080 --> 38:54.530
It's quite surprising!

38:55.120 --> 38:56.120
Is it?

38:57.590 --> 38:58.630
They're so soft!

39:00.230 --> 39:01.000
Thanks.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.820
Eh, listen Rose, where exactly
does the ectoplasm come from?

39:05.110 --> 39:07.220
It doesn't matter, you'll see in a minute.

39:07.460 --> 39:09.190
Now, just close you eyes-

39:09.400 --> 39:10.400
ok?

39:11.570 --> 39:16.400
Oh, spirit on the road between life
and death, I call out to you now!

39:19.740 --> 39:21.480
Would you like tea or anything?

39:23.000 --> 39:27.970
Tom Bern, my talents compel
you to show yourself!

39:37.200 --> 39:42.770
Oh, restless spirit!
Enter now this vessel I have before me!

39:46.510 --> 39:48.310
Whenever you're ready, please!

39:49.020 --> 39:50.250
It's working.

39:54.730 --> 39:56.360
Jan! Is it yourself?

39:56.560 --> 39:58.700
Tom? Is that you?

39:58.900 --> 40:00.400
It is I, my love.

40:00.630 --> 40:01.630
How are you?

40:01.630 --> 40:04.360
Gosh all mighty, I thought
I'd never get rid of ya.

40:04.360 --> 40:08.000
- Now it seems as though I was right!
- Janet if you just let me do the spirit talking-

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
'Cause it's actually very
complicated and technical?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
How are you my love?

40:12.000 --> 40:16.160
- My name is Rose... He's three times
your age, would you look at yourself!

40:16.160 --> 40:17.800
- Janet! No!
- Ah!

40:17.930 --> 40:20.360
Who is this succubus?

40:23.360 --> 40:26.730
I would actually like
that cup of tea, please?

40:26.900 --> 40:28.160
Dirty ol' fuck"

40:28.160 --> 40:30.550
Is just if there's a green bin-

40:30.550 --> 40:34.600
Right there I don't know why
you wouldn't just recycle to the green bin!

40:34.600 --> 40:36.210
Look the milk coming in for recycling!

40:36.210 --> 40:37.940
That's perfect, isn't it?

40:38.210 --> 40:42.550
Yeah! Uhm, you don't have to worry
about that anymore, all right?

40:42.550 --> 40:44.550
Tom, give me your little hands.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.330
Good man, now-

40:48.150 --> 40:50.820
Oh, restless spirit!

40:51.000 --> 40:53.830
Untether yourself from this world.

40:53.880 --> 40:56.440
And let the tides carry you home!

41:07.600 --> 41:08.880
Good job!

41:10.650 --> 41:11.650
Very good.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.020
Martin? We did it!

41:17.020 --> 41:20.880
Why do this have to be unnecessarily gross?

41:20.880 --> 41:22.800
We did it.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.450
This witch must be stopped.

41:26.340 --> 41:28.970
We must break that holding spell.

41:30.740 --> 41:31.820
Pumpkin?

41:31.940 --> 41:35.280
I believe it's time to face
one of my biggest fears...

41:35.710 --> 41:36.710
Ducks?

41:37.420 --> 41:39.250
No, my darling.

41:39.480 --> 41:40.620
Tomorrow...

41:41.310 --> 41:43.310
I'm going to learn to drive!

42:06.650 --> 42:08.820
Bogger eejit.

42:11.770 --> 42:15.650
- Oh, hello!
- Hello sleepyhead!

42:15.650 --> 42:16.820
You're up?

42:16.820 --> 42:19.880
I'm sorry, I'm great.

42:21.140 --> 42:23.420
Turns out taking a ghost
into your body and-

42:23.420 --> 42:28.250
puking his up ectoplasm when your daughter is under
a satanic levitation spell will take it out of you.

42:28.970 --> 42:32.080
But you're now learning so fast, though!

42:34.800 --> 42:36.570
Good teacher!

42:36.570 --> 42:39.940
Good teacher? Good partner!

42:45.020 --> 42:48.220
Right, so I better go in.
Bonnie will be wondering where I've been.

42:48.220 --> 42:50.770
All right, ok. Goodnight!

42:52.080 --> 42:53.340
See you tomorrow!

43:02.740 --> 43:05.570
Oh, look who came crawling back...

43:05.570 --> 43:08.110
I, uhm... I totally forgot Sarah.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.510
So have I!

43:20.510 --> 43:22.140
Morning!

43:27.110 --> 43:28.600
Hello, toaster!

43:28.880 --> 43:30.910
Long time no see, branch!

43:30.910 --> 43:33.250
Hello little ghost lady!

43:33.710 --> 43:34.800
Hello!

43:36.080 --> 43:38.770
I'm sorry! I thought you were dead!

43:40.880 --> 43:42.050
My goodness.

44:13.620 --> 44:14.680
Yes.

44:14.820 --> 44:19.260
So, yes. Throughout this series,
we have shone a light into the darkness.

44:19.260 --> 44:23.380
Goodness nurtures love. Love defeats evil.

44:23.880 --> 44:24.880
Thanks, Rose.

44:25.100 --> 44:28.100
It's love that binds the
best partnerships together.

44:28.260 --> 44:30.760
It's where true magic comes from.

44:31.060 --> 44:35.820
- See you tonight, partner!
- That's why I emphasize caution with your given talent!

44:36.660 --> 44:39.320
So if one partner makes
the slightest mistake,

44:39.380 --> 44:43.580
the other can be sucked up
into he spinning void of chaos!

44:43.760 --> 44:46.640
Ending up stuck, or trapped! Or even worst!

44:46.640 --> 44:48.860
Nowhere at all!

44:49.640 --> 44:55.720
Lucky I have nothing to worry about, because
my talented partner never makes mistakes.

44:56.580 --> 44:57.800
She's...

45:02.740 --> 45:07.140
She's extraordinary.
Extraordinary. Extraordinary.

45:40.100 --> 45:41.620
I can't do this.

45:48.700 --> 45:50.260
Hello there, Rose!

45:50.260 --> 45:51.740
This is Martin here.

45:51.740 --> 45:54.480
Look forward tu getting up and
at it whenever you're ready!

45:54.480 --> 45:56.620
I think we're really
gonna kick some ass today!

45:56.620 --> 45:58.620
So will you excuse my french.

45:58.620 --> 46:00.620
See you soon, partner!

46:01.040 --> 46:03.000
Bye-e!

46:05.000 --> 46:09.520
Hello, Rose Dooley. Christian
Winter the artist, here!

46:09.520 --> 46:13.260
I hear you're rather
talented driving instructor.

46:13.260 --> 46:18.940
I should like to employ your services
today, noon, at my castle. Good day.

46:29.980 --> 46:31.500
She's extraordinary!

46:37.720 --> 46:40.100
Hi! This is Rose. I'm on my way.

46:50.940 --> 46:52.400
I made you a sandwich.

46:53.220 --> 46:54.700
Thank you, my dear.

46:55.120 --> 46:58.980
I couldn't face it right now
but, perhaps, after my tutorial.

46:59.160 --> 47:02.020
Don't be such a drama queen! It's
a driving lesson, you dickhead!

47:02.020 --> 47:03.040
Get it bloody done.

47:03.040 --> 47:05.040
Yes, ma'am.

47:05.940 --> 47:07.560
Ah, here she comes!

47:08.240 --> 47:11.140
So, how are you gonna find out
what she's been up to then, babe?

47:12.080 --> 47:14.500
Guess a little clever sleuthing?

47:14.660 --> 47:16.280
It's chocolate spread, by the way.

47:27.580 --> 47:30.200
Hi! Hi, I'm Rose!

47:30.200 --> 47:32.200
Delighted.

47:32.200 --> 47:35.400
We've met yesterday, actually,
outside Bargains Galore?

47:35.400 --> 47:38.580
- Ah, yes! In the slaughter house.
- NO, in the shop.

47:38.960 --> 47:40.400
Yes. Yep.

47:40.400 --> 47:42.540
Memorable encounter indeed.

47:42.920 --> 47:45.420
Yeah, so.. Driving!

47:45.980 --> 47:49.900
I've packed myself a
snack, in some sense here.

47:50.380 --> 47:51.960
It's chocolate spread.

47:52.260 --> 47:53.260
Oh, great.

48:08.880 --> 48:09.940
Now.

48:36.780 --> 48:38.860
´Proceed.
- Ok, now!

48:38.860 --> 48:41.540
So, both hands on the wheel!

48:41.540 --> 48:45.660
Right? Very good! And now you
just push down on the clutch.

48:49.660 --> 48:52.220
With your foot, sorry, use you foot.

48:52.220 --> 48:54.220
Of course, yes, yes.

48:57.120 --> 48:59.900
That's the accelerator,
sorry, that's the accelerator.

49:00.920 --> 49:01.640
No.

49:01.760 --> 49:05.620
You're absolutely fine. So this time
push the clutch down with your foot.

49:06.520 --> 49:07.520
Very good.

49:08.960 --> 49:10.480
That's the accelerator again there!

49:10.480 --> 49:13.640
No, ok. That's, yeah" That is the clutch!

49:13.640 --> 49:13.880
Yes.

49:14.060 --> 49:16.520
Good, but just, use your left foot.

49:16.520 --> 49:18.960
Or use your other left foot.

49:20.760 --> 49:26.220
Very good! Great stuff. Now we can
just slip the car into first gear.

49:39.840 --> 49:42.120
Oh my god! Are you-
Christian?

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Are you ok?

49:47.040 --> 49:49.820
I think I should like
to go home now, my dear.

49:50.480 --> 49:53.060
Okay, no-
Maybe you shloud, yeah.

49:53.800 --> 49:54.800
Thank you1

49:55.880 --> 49:59.180
Perhaps this driving is just not for me.

49:59.620 --> 50:00.720
No...

50:01.120 --> 50:04.260
I'm just a bad teacher.
I shouldn't be doing this either.

50:05.900 --> 50:06.900
Huh?

50:07.300 --> 50:12.020
Is ther perhaps another field
that yours true talents may lie?

50:12.020 --> 50:13.020
No.

50:13.780 --> 50:16.180
Not really, I mean-

50:16.180 --> 50:19.540
- Kinda, but actually-
- Talent is what fuels us.

50:20.040 --> 50:22.420
What stirs our loins.

50:22.420 --> 50:26.960
What elevates us from the beasts!
And other non-amazing people.

50:27.520 --> 50:31.180
YOu really rather just
have no talents at all?

50:31.340 --> 50:33.300
Spend your life doing this?

50:38.620 --> 50:40.580
I just like everything to be...

50:41.780 --> 50:42.840
Ordinary.

50:43.220 --> 50:44.300
So maybe I can help.

50:44.580 --> 50:46.240
Perhaps if I...

50:47.080 --> 50:48.080
May I?

50:48.900 --> 50:49.900
What?

50:53.120 --> 50:56.640
And I sang, la la la!

50:56.640 --> 50:58.640
Cosmic woman.

50:58.640 --> 51:03.220
La la la, my cosmic woman...

51:03.640 --> 51:04.840
Little better?

51:05.680 --> 51:07.380
I think yeah, thank you.

51:08.180 --> 51:10.260
And perhaps a, uh-

51:10.260 --> 51:12.400
Small token of my gratitude.

51:12.420 --> 51:16.400
An exclusive preview of my new material.
It's a signed copy!

51:16.560 --> 51:18.980
From one talented person to another.

51:18.980 --> 51:21.700
- Oh that's lovely!
- In lieu of payment, of course.

51:23.280 --> 51:24.680
All right.

51:25.320 --> 51:26.740
Fair well, my dear.

51:27.580 --> 51:29.040
All right, goodbye!

51:32.920 --> 51:35.660
Oh, sorry! The door. I'll get it.

51:41.380 --> 51:42.540
Weird.

51:53.240 --> 51:56.120
World class.

52:05.200 --> 52:07.480
I was nervous you weren't going to come!

52:07.480 --> 52:09.200
I cook when I'm nervous.

52:09.200 --> 52:11.000
I eat when I'm nervous.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Seems we make a great team, uh?

52:13.160 --> 52:14.240
Yeah...

52:14.760 --> 52:17.760
I've got a few jars washed and
ready for the ectoplasm tonight!

52:17.760 --> 52:21.640
And... I made you this earlier,
when I was restless.

52:21.640 --> 52:24.100
Oh my go, that's fabulous!

52:24.370 --> 52:26.790
This is gonna make mockery
out of all my other crockery!

52:26.790 --> 52:27.680
Thank you.

52:27.680 --> 52:29.680
I make you a spoon when all this is done.

52:29.990 --> 52:31.010
You like garlic?

52:31.270 --> 52:32.600
Uhm, not really.

52:32.600 --> 52:34.600
So what was it you wanted to chat about?

52:34.660 --> 52:35.720
Bonnie, no!

52:36.360 --> 52:38.070
Ah, it's gone everywhere.

52:40.070 --> 52:43.040
Martin can you just leave that sauce
and listen to me just for a second?

52:43.110 --> 52:44.420
Yes, what is it?

52:44.420 --> 52:47.460
I really think it's important that I tell
you what happened to my last partner.

52:47.490 --> 52:48.490
Your dad?

52:50.200 --> 52:53.170
We were investigating a
haunted pot hole, right?

52:53.170 --> 52:54.870
And there was a woman there with her dog,

52:54.870 --> 52:58.440
and she just held the empty lead
and the dog was inside the pot hole.

52:58.520 --> 52:59.520
And my dad said:

52:59.590 --> 53:01.640
Some sort of apparitional portal.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.880
You did the right thing calling us.

53:04.310 --> 53:06.070
It doesn't look good, I'm afraid.

53:06.880 --> 53:09.330
The best we can do for, ehm...

53:09.330 --> 53:10.330
Beans...

53:12.420 --> 53:14.290
Beans... Here.

53:14.580 --> 53:17.810
Is to be sure he makes
it to the other side.

53:18.450 --> 53:22.310
And my dad said to me like "It's on you, Rose",
you know? Like it was gonna be my turn to do it?

53:22.310 --> 53:24.850
Now, Rose, there are two
spirits at play here.

53:25.640 --> 53:27.010
The pot hole spirit.

53:27.520 --> 53:28.500
And Beans.

53:28.500 --> 53:30.640
- Daddy, I can't!- Follow your heart.
Rosie.

53:30.870 --> 53:32.370
Always trust your talents.

53:32.370 --> 53:34.790
And went to re-inhabit
the spirit of the dog-

53:37.060 --> 53:39.090
So he was like <i>"woof woof woof woof</i>"!

53:39.090 --> 53:42.900
So Beans, the dog, was actually in him and
animals spirits are always kinda tricky.

53:42.930 --> 53:45.890
That's my Beans!
Oh, you're a good boy, aren't ya?

53:45.890 --> 53:51.060
But you see, the spinning pot hole was in him
too so he became part pot hole part dog.

53:51.060 --> 53:53.670
But I totally panicked
and I forgot the words.

53:53.670 --> 53:57.060
Oh, you traveler on the
road between land and-Oh.

53:57.060 --> 54:00.500
And then daddy freaked and went spinning
into the middle of the road.

54:00.500 --> 54:03.270
And the next thing I see the lorry
coming down the road towards him-

54:03.270 --> 54:05.480
An the lory driver is
like "b <i>oo bu boo bu boo"</i>!

54:05.480 --> 54:07.770
And I was like "<i>daddy, nooo</i>"!

54:09.110 --> 54:10.790
And the lorry smushed daddy.

54:13.190 --> 54:14.190
That was it.

54:14.450 --> 54:20.200
And then there was like a magpie up in the tree,
and the magpie is like "k aa kaa kaa kaa"!

54:20.200 --> 54:22.200
You know this kind thing? <i>KAAA!</i>

54:22.950 --> 54:23.950
<i>Kaa!</i>

54:24.960 --> 54:26.440
You know when that's happened to you?

54:27.020 --> 54:30.100
So that's like, I need to tell you. You
need to find yourself a new partner.

54:32.840 --> 54:33.840
What?

54:34.610 --> 54:37.250
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that happened to you but-

54:37.250 --> 54:38.650
We don't have a choice!

54:38.650 --> 54:40.400
The Blood Moon is tonight.

54:40.400 --> 54:43.740
And anyway I don't care if anything
happens to me, she's my little girl!

54:43.740 --> 54:45.740
Yeah, but like, I care you know?

54:45.900 --> 54:49.540
Because I can't go through all of
this again, I really can't Martin!

54:49.540 --> 54:51.940
So I'm just gonna take my bowl
and I'm just gonna say goodbye!

54:51.940 --> 54:53.680
Just hang on a minute!

54:53.680 --> 54:57.320
My daughter is about to be deflowered by the
devil and you're telling me you won't help?

54:57.320 --> 54:59.500
- I can't help!
- What are you so afraid of?

55:00.000 --> 55:02.080
Didn't you hear my story?
Reacted to it and everything!

55:02.080 --> 55:04.680
I made one tiny mistake and
my dad actually got killed!

55:04.680 --> 55:06.680
He turned into a <i>dog-pot
hole </i> and he got killed!

55:06.680 --> 55:08.680
- So what?
- So what?!

55:09.080 --> 55:11.680
No, I don't-I don't mean... So what!

55:11.680 --> 55:13.680
I mean-I Mean, you're just afraid!

55:13.680 --> 55:16.310
I am afraid? You're the one
who's scared of you dead wife!

55:16.810 --> 55:19.560
I saw what she did to the garlic!
D you think I'm blind?

55:19.760 --> 55:21.560
Rose, I know you think I'm crazy-

55:21.560 --> 55:23.430
I don't think that you're crazy.

55:23.430 --> 55:27.850
But actually I think you're scared! Because I think
you're scared of what your life will be like without her.

55:28.800 --> 55:29.890
Yes, I'm scared!

55:30.460 --> 55:32.550
I am afraid and I'm fine with that.

55:32.760 --> 55:35.510
If you don't help, Sarah is going to die!

55:35.510 --> 55:37.510
That's all I meant!

55:37.720 --> 55:41.320
But this wouldn't be making a mistake.
This, would be not even tring!

55:53.480 --> 55:57.110
<i>♪ Satan, Satan ♪</i>

56:01.330 --> 56:07.260
<i>♪ Satan, Satan ♪</i>

56:16.420 --> 56:21.130
<i>♪ SATAN, SATAN ♪</i>

56:32.970 --> 56:35.570
World class.

56:40.040 --> 56:48.040
<i>♪ You still on my mind, Oh!
And even though I manage on my own ♪</i>

56:51.040 --> 56:59.040
<i>♪ My heart is low! My heart is so
low, as only a woman's heart can be ♪</i>

57:10.080 --> 57:15.800
I saw the guitar there and... She really
liked that song when she was small.

57:15.800 --> 57:17.640
Is just lovely, Martin.

57:17.640 --> 57:19.640
Especially sung in a male voice.

57:20.360 --> 57:25.380
I have it on cassette and in my, uhm,
car and I have it on cd at home.

57:25.600 --> 57:29.360
Rose, I'm sorry about that... Mild burst.

57:30.320 --> 57:35.000
_ No, it's ok. Anyway, you're right, like-
- Listen Rose, it's ok.

57:35.040 --> 57:38.440
You don't have to explain it to me,
I understand what it's like.

57:43.680 --> 57:45.760
Well., we better go Martin.

57:45.760 --> 57:48.640
That ectoplasm isn't
going to collect itself!

57:51.520 --> 57:53.520
So I better change my shirt!

57:53.520 --> 57:55.520
Ok, anyways.

57:55.520 --> 57:57.520
I'll wait downstairs, so...

58:43.200 --> 58:44.760
This shirt's lovely on ya!

58:44.760 --> 58:45.760
Thanks!

58:46.130 --> 58:47.810
Is it a donut? Can I have a bit?

58:48.450 --> 58:49.450
No.

58:49.490 --> 58:51.040
Oh! That's Sailor there, ok.

58:51.040 --> 58:53.620
Now, just so you know, she thinks
we're on a date tonight, so.

58:53.700 --> 58:54.070
Why?

58:54.070 --> 58:58.070
She somehow, like, got the impression that
we like, got giddy last night, like...

59:00.470 --> 59:01.000
Like-

59:01.280 --> 59:02.370
Or like-

59:02.370 --> 59:04.370
I don't know, whatever it's like.

59:04.960 --> 59:05.540
Gross.

59:05.540 --> 59:07.540
I know, that's what I-
She's demented, like..

59:07.860 --> 59:09.220
Not a chance!

59:10.980 --> 59:14.050
Hi! Nice dress, it was granny's is it?

59:14.400 --> 59:16.050
Oh, hi! You're Martin!

59:16.950 --> 59:19.800
- Hello Sailor!- Hello Sailor, oh you
have heard that one before, Martin?

59:19.800 --> 59:22.310
And yeah, it's a nickname and no,
I'm not gonna tell you my real name-

59:22.310 --> 59:24.310
- Sailor, stop, would ya?
So where is this baby then?

59:24.310 --> 59:26.310
She's upstairs. There's
no need to check on her.

59:26.310 --> 59:28.600
I wasn't planning on it, do you know
how long it takes me to get the stairs?

59:28.600 --> 59:30.760
Yeah, just ring us if
she wakes or anything.

59:30.760 --> 59:32.210
And don't go upstairs!

59:32.210 --> 59:34.450
- Straight away, just give us a ring.
- All right, <i>chillax</i>!

59:34.450 --> 59:37.330
- Geez, you two will get along just fine-
- Seriously, don't go upstairs.

59:40.160 --> 59:40.850
Go on!

59:40.850 --> 59:42.850
Thanks, Sailor.

59:48.840 --> 59:50.310
What a shit hole.

59:51.410 --> 59:53.170
You have several new messages.

59:53.590 --> 59:54.710
Christ.

59:54.820 --> 59:57.220
My nana Diedra has appeared
to me in the kichten.

59:57.220 --> 01:00:00.080
I can't even face <i>me</i> cocoa
puffs with her staring!

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.600
You think it looks like Hitler?

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.600
Or a turtle, maybe?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.520
Or the Hamburgler?

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:07.940
Nah, it's definitely <i>me</i>
nan' Diedra old eyes.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.940
Why is he here? Watching me?

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:15.760
I mean, could nana Diedra
have a message for you? Like-

01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:17.960
She's annoyed about something?

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.230
I've collected a lot of
money for a sponsored work.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.130
There was no work.

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.700
I think she's warning me
to change my crooked ways.

01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:31.310
Bingo.

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:32.790
That's it, yeah.

01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:34.370
I'll have a quick chat with her.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.500
Good job.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.000
Rose Dooley?

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.990
Your help would be greatly appreciated.

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:52.120
It's been weeping constantly for two days.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.120
I'm quite spooked, actually.

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:02.710
These tears are Seven Up.

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:05.480
It's mother!

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.680
She adored Seven Up!

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:21.060
Ey chaps, the chips won't stay in the pan!
The costumers are gonna leave us.

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:22.580
Is there anything you can do?

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:24.430
Good job Martin.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.260
Excellent lads! See you out.

01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:32.110
It's nearly dawn.

01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:34.850
We are running out of time!

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:38.900
I spot him out in the back,
going through m <i>e </i> bins.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.190
And how big was this, <i>wolfman</i> ?

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.660
Hard to say, but geez,
I wouldn't mess with him.

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:46.800
Out for blood, he was.

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:48.800
And you said he had ginger hair?

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.780
Oh definitely!

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:55.110
I shinned a torch on him and his
hair was as orange as a-as a...

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:56.020
An orange?

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:59.030
♪♪♪♪, that kinda colour you know?

01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:02.440
Sniffy nose and uhm, s<font size="30" face="Chiller">harp fangs argh!</font>

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:07.800
I suppose if you were a red tempered person
you'd became a ginger werewolf.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.980
Four legs, and a long tail on him too!

01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:13.700
Mr. Daily, was it a fox?

01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:15.920
I'd say it was, yeah.

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.650
All right. Good night, so.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.500
Good luck love. Will call again, soon!

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.740
Oh, shit! <i>Me</i> keys.

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:27.490
We're one short.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.900
I can think of one more.

01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:38.660
This place gives me the creeps.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:40.660
Haven't been here in ages.

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:41.350
Just out here, yep.

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:42.640
Not since...

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.870
On the funeral actually.

01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:48.130
That makes me feel bad, I should probably
visit her grave more often.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.790
You know, it's just around...

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.790
Here, actually.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:57.380
What? This was your plan all evening,
to bring me here?

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.760
I'm sorry, and I think you
know what you need to do.

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:03.480
I'm a coward, Rose. We've
already established that.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.520
Beaten down, held captive by a dead person.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.500
You never asked me how Bonnie died.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.520
Well-

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.680
Yeah, there never seem to
have a good time but...

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:23.810
I made Bonnie a wooden clock.

01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:27.090
And everyday, at the exact
time that we got married-

01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:33.380
The little wooden me and the little
wooden Bonnie would pop out and kiss.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.130
It broke and killed her.

01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:41.830
That wasn't a very good story!

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.540
It's not as good as yours.

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:46.230
I really didn't commit
to it in the same way.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.720
Eight years later...

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.720
Look what I've become!

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:54.080
Well, that's all changed now, ok?

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.670
Because this? This wasn't you fault!

01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:05.730
You know what Rose? Since I've met you,
you've made me see what's possible.

01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:08.530
And I'm not talking about ghosts
and spirits and all of that!

01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:10.530
You've made me realize that...

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:12.950
Well, it's time!

01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:15.840
I can move towards the light!

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.840
Me too, Martin!

01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:20.790
You know, I used to think I was invisible.

01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:24.930
Like, until this, I felt like
I was a ghost too. You know?

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.680
And it's awful!

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.680
And I don't wanna feel like that anymore.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.290
And I'm sure Bonnie doesn't
want that for you either.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.950
Thanks, Martin.

01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:40.950
I never felt this alive!

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.530
And it's because you
believed that I was real.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:47.990
I know that we are gonna <i>do it</i>!

01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:51.060
Save Sarah?

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:53.060
Yeah. obviously!

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:55.060
Let's do it!

01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:56.640
- Ok...
- Let's do it.

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.310
Who's this?

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.280
How was your date?

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.600
- Sailor! You have to go, I'm sorry.
- What?

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.760
- Yeah, come on.
- Brian, set me up there, will ya?

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.120
HI, I'm Brian Welsh by the way.

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.460
The local county counsel.

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:36.760
Shut up, Brian! Jesus...

01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:38.820
She knows something's up!

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.260
What the fuck was that?

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:42.840
Yeah, no, we're running out of time, ok?
We have to get her out now!

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.840
What? What's going on?

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.200
I don't have time to explain 'cause
it can sack me a few minutes-

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:50.260
We have to exorcise his dead wife, Bonnie, or else we
won't get the ectoplasm we need to save his daughter-

01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:52.680
Because, otherwise she's gonna
be ravished by hell demons.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.710
- Just explained it there, ain't it Rose?
- Yeah.

01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:56.020
Anyway, I-I-I'll set up!

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.020
Okay, cool.

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.170
- I'm gonna head off, anyone in?
- Shut up Brian, will ya?

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:06.790
Why didn't you tell me what was going on?

01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:11.520
Well, cause you thought we had a date, like- And you
were so proud of me, I don't know, it felt nice.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.640
I'm always proud of you.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:14.770
Thickhead.

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:15.650
Thanks.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.600
So, nothing going on then?

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.400
Nah...

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.400
- Ok, all set up, Rose!
- Ok, great!

01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:21.330
Would you want me to stay?

01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:22.340
Would you?

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:23.640
- Yeah, help me up!
- Ok.

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:24.740
- Rose?
- Yeah?

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:26.610
This is actually fucking deadly.

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.880
So exciting!

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.630
So cool you're using your talent again.

01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.630
Brian!

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.760
Now!

01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:45.650
I seal this pact with a drop of blood!

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:51.260
Now.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160
You're ready?

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:05.330
Oh, spirit on the road between
life and death, I call out to you!

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:13.350
Open now the gate, so that the
living may speak with the dead!

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.850
I summon the hence onto thos realm.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:21.220
Bonnie Martin. Of 25, Parkmoore Drive-

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:25.560
My spirit compels thee to show yourself!

01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:28.350
Bonnie?

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:35.460
Get the fuck out of my house!

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:36.000
Bonnie?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.720
Sailor, can I go home?

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.870
I see what's going on here...

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:42.500
- You fancy my Martin!
- No!

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:46.880
You just wanna get rid of me
so you can get your dirty paws on him!

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.050
That's not it at all!

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:50.040
Martin is mine!

01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:52.040
Sarah! Is mine.

01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:55.600
An this house is mine.

01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:03.920
Bonnie! You loved Martin
and Martin loved you! But-

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.920
Do you remember your wedding day?

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.920
Do you remember what you told him?

01:08:08.610 --> 01:08:09.800
No anal?

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:14.580
Didn't you also say to him
"u <i>ntil death do us part"</i> ?

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:18.180
Bonnie, I'm so sorry but
it's time for you to part!

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.120
The hair of the local witch.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.120
Now to block her talents!

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.920
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.920
Someone's interfering with <i>me</i> talents!

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.590
Break the holding spell!

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:37.800
Look at your there.

01:08:37.819 --> 01:08:40.950
On your knees, like a
ragged down low whore.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.160
A vote for me is a vote for progress.

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:45.520
Rose, c'mon! Trust you talents!

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.810
You wish to be ordinary?

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:53.840
Allow me to grant that wish!

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:17.000
Bonnie Martin! Look for safe place.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Trouble the living no more!

01:09:21.029 --> 01:09:24.439
Leave this space and this realm!

01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:26.850
Oh, Jesus!

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:27.439
Brian?!

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:32.160
Get a handful of that, take those jars and
run upstairs and rub into his daughter face!

01:09:32.609 --> 01:09:34.100
- Right now!
- Quickly, hurry up!

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.080
Good lad!

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.080
Ok, Martin? Wake up!

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:42.260
Martin? You said you were
gonna make me a tool!

01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:44.870
Oh no! It's happening again!

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:46.870
O Martin, I'm so sorry!

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:49.279
Rose?

01:09:49.939 --> 01:09:50.939
What?

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.279
Martin? Is that you?

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:56.280
- I'm here.
- You are?

01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:05.250
Oh my god!

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:06.050
Rose!

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.450
I knew it you dirty whore!

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:09.240
No!

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.580
Martin?

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:13.490
Martin can't come to the phone right now...

01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:15.490
So get the fuck out of my house!

01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:17.490
Oh my god! Ok-

01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:19.800
MArtin? I'm just gonna try something ok?

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.000
Did you just slap me?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.330
Yeah, sorry.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.590
It's-it's ok, what happened?

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:28.720
I kinda went wrong.

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.290
- There's no one up there!
- What?

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:32.190
Sarah!

01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:34.860
Sarah!

01:10:39.010 --> 01:10:40.010
Sarah!

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.280
She's gone! What did you do?

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.780
Martin, leave her alone.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.530
Where is she?

01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:51.860
I've messed up and,
she's been summoned to the sacrifice!

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.200
Oh no...

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.680
Martin, I'm so, so sorry!

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:59.140
I'm shite? I'm a slut?

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.800
Is that what you were going to say?

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.480
Ehm, is Martin possessed now?

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.480
Bonnie!

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:08.200
No! No one talks to my
sister like that! NO!

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.820
Hello mister magpie!

01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:22.950
I think I need your help.

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:25.330
Blokes! Stop fighting!

01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:27.200
We need to follow this magpie!

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.000
Follow the bird.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Ah, that makes sense.

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:42.730
Wait! You're going too fast!

01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:45.510
You'll let them get away.

01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:47.880
Hey, let me drive this shitehole!

01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:54.000
We lost him! We lost mister magpie!

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.480
- Thanks for the lift anyway guys, just let me off here.
- Stop Brian, will ya?

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.550
Bonnie? Bonnie, Sarah is being kidnapped.

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:04.000
What? Martin, you eejit!

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.200
No, leave him alone!

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:08.020
How in god's name did you manage that?

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.530
It's not Martin's fault!

01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:11.310
Of course it is! He's a tick!

01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:13.620
That isn't true and you
need to leave him alone.

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:16.060
You've been holding him hostage
up in that house for years!

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:18.060
Himself and poor Sarah!

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:21.620
I'm sorry about her!

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.620
Wait, is that her?

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.200
Hold on!

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:28.550
She is not a baby?

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:32.750
It's Christian Winter!

01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:35.170
It's Christian Winter this whole time?

01:12:35.170 --> 01:12:37.710
- Creepy little fucking-
- Satanist!

01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:41.000
Ill tempest. The local witch.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Yeah, I said boiled rice is fine!

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.460
How long?

01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:48.400
Ok, but if it's any
later I won't be paying.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.260
There are more pressing matters my dear.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.200
Sarah!

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.440
Martin?

01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:07.390
Martin, no!

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:10.570
No, Martin, don't wake her!

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:13.550
No, Martin! Never wake a floating goat!

01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:21.570
Darling, set your lock in, please.

01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:29.520
You <i>unsacrifice</i> my daughter right now, before I come
in there and pull those stupid bloody eyebrows off!

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.650
Refrain from shouting, you'll wake
the virgin and ruin this for everyone!

01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:35.650
Come here you little...

01:13:35.970 --> 01:13:38.350
Jesus Christ, you're like
a pair of school girls!

01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:42.720
Oh fuck this!

01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:55.400
Ah, the virgin!

01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:58.470
Zip! I wanna get home
before my c <i>hinese </i> arrives!

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.120
Is this yours?

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:24.800
Oh! My index finger!

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:29.170
Everybody! Get into the fucking car!

01:14:29.670 --> 01:14:32.070
Winter is a dead man!

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:48.670
Let my new age of darkness begin.

01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:58.220
We're almost out of time!
Anyone have any ideas?

01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:01.470
How about we ring the bell
and pretend we're delivering something?

01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:03.720
Jesus, Brian.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.650
See? I was right!

01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:10.170
Good one, Brian!
Your contributions are getting better!

01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:12.420
The mongol in the back was right.

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:14.670
Here we go! All thanks to Brian!

01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:16.670
Yes! High-fives, everyone!

01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:18.670
Oh, sorry, high-four, Bonnie.

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.000
I think it's weird you brought the bird.

01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:28.650
Hold on mate, I said special
fried rice, not boiled!

01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:30.120
Sorry, Miss, the dock says boiled-

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:30.850
Special fried.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.070
- No, look, boiled-Special fried!
Can you not hear me? Are you deaf?

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:36.450
If you're deaf you really
shouldn't be taking phone orders.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.870
I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:46.770
Fifteen minutes or it's free!

01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:50.220
Hear me powers of the night!

01:15:50.970 --> 01:15:53.100
The Blood Moon is nigh!

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:57.400
I offer this sacrifice in honor of you!

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.920
Chinese is here, love!

01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:01.470
I got it for free, too!

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:06.900
I can't wait, I'm starving! I'll
put yours out for you though.

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:10.520
I offer this sacrifice, in honor of you.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.220
Sanctified with virgin blood!

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:16.200
- And with this impure bloo-
- Spoons or chopsticks, love?

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.770
Spoon or chopsticks?

01:16:17.770 --> 01:16:19.000
Please dear!

01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:21.150
I'm in the middle of some-

01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:24.000
Now, with virgin blood,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
and with impure blood,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.600
I pray you'll accept this sacrifice, or
let life be ever extinguished from my soul!

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.070
I know she's floating
and that looks really good and all, but-

01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:39.920
If the demon is just gonna fuck her a bit,
and then tear her to pieces,

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.920
why don't we just kill the bitch?

01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:50.350
Wich is mine?

01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:51.670
The <i> kung pao</i>...

01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:52.920
Thank you.

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:03.250
Goodnight my sweet.

01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:13.800
Now where was I? Ah, yes.

01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:27.000
That's the door!

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.620
Ok. Now, nobody be scared, ok?

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:42.600
Brian, I'm in labor! Those two
contractions were very close together!

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:43.870
Oh shit, Sailor!

01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:47.620
Ok, you just sit down on
here now, I'll tell Rose.

01:17:47.650 --> 01:17:48.920
You will not!

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.100
You keep your mouth shut, do you hear me? There's
much more important things going on right now.

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.370
More important? How could
it be more important?

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.200
Brian!

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:56.950
- I'm sorry...
- Ok, good man.

01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:58.950
Just stick with me in case I need ya, ok?

01:17:58.950 --> 01:18:00.950
Come on.

01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:04.100
Impure blood!

01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.620
I pray you'll accept my sacrifice!

01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:10.270
- Or let life be ever extinguished from my soul!
- Sarah!

01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:11.650
What have you done to her?

01:18:11.650 --> 01:18:13.770
Yeah, and give me back my scrunchie!

01:18:13.770 --> 01:18:16.450
Can one man just sacrifice
a virgin in peace?

01:18:16.450 --> 01:18:19.350
No, Christian! Put her down!

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:22.070
This is over!

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.650
No, my dear...

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.370
Quite the opposite.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.320
It's working!

01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:56.070
- No!
- No!

01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:58.070
God no! God, no...

01:18:58.070 --> 01:19:00.070
Sarah!

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.000
I'm ba-ack!

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.670
<i>♪ Just another beautiful tuesday!
With a the moon lit night at the castle ♪</i>

01:19:12.670 --> 01:19:16.350
<i>♪ Yeah! Bye-bye, bye at the docks ♪</i>

01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:21.250
God! It's not working! Why isn't it
working? I killed my wife for this!

01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:24.500
- And two virgins!
- I'm going to fucking kill you-

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.500
You talentless prick!

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.770
Your daughter's life was my paint brush,
she helped me create a masterpiece!

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:38.700
A two disk masterpiece called: Yester me!

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:40.700
To be hon-I think. Tittle <i>TBC</i>.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.870
Martin, be careful, you're finger...

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:45.700
You fight like a girl!

01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:49.120
- You're right, dickhead!
- Bonnie...

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.400
You killed my Sarah, you puntz!

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:06.120
You have a strange fight etiquette!

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.250
Sarah? Sarah!

01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:15.250
What?

01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:17.050
Sarah!

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.820
Burger and chips?

01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:22.820
Oh, my baby girl!

01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:24.820
- Thank god!
- Noo!

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:28.400
Get back in there! Get back in the hole!

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:39.220
I don't think this is over!

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:47.720
Oh shit, Charlie!

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.770
The Dark Lord!

01:20:54.650 --> 01:20:56.420
I've done a small wee.

01:20:58.070 --> 01:21:01.150
I am Astaroth!

01:21:01.150 --> 01:21:01.820
Hello!

01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:04.670
Eater of souls!

01:21:04.670 --> 01:21:08.400
Which one of you mortals summoned me forth?

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:12.020
I did! That'd be me,
Astaroht, my Lord and Master!

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:15.100
Oh, it's wonderful to meet you, finally!

01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:17.820
Let me serenade thee, my
keyboards are just killer!

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:19.170
Silence!

01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:23.920
You have broken our contract!

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:29.400
Now, we will feast on your soul!

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:35.600
I-I-I sent you a virgin,
I followed the instruction, my Lord!

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.870
Did you really think you can deceive us?

01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:44.300
She is no virgin!

01:21:45.370 --> 01:21:47.400
What?

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.400
What?

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.350
Wes, she is!

01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:54.070
Uh oh!

01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:56.070
Sarah?

01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:58.070
Is that true?

01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:59.670
My precious flower...

01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:01.020
Deflowered, more like, Martin?

01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:04.570
Was it Charlie Dawn, that little fucker?
I knew he was sniffing around!

01:22:04.570 --> 01:22:06.300
Who said it was a guy anyway?

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.270
Martin. It doesn't matter, ok?

01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:09.320
We can deal with this tomorrow.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.100
You are grounded, young lady!

01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.100
Stop!

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.950
Kids start so early these days!

01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:20.200
Silence! The Dark Ones must be satisfied!

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:23.400
The ritual must be completed!

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:27.260
We need another virgin!

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:29.950
But I have not prepared any more virgins!

01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:31.950
There're-
There are no more virgins!

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:37.840
We'll take that one!

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:44.260
Me?

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.880
What?

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:47.170
Really?

01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:48.950
No!

01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:50.530
Hardly!

01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:52.680
Hold on! What about Deklin O'Donnel?

01:22:52.970 --> 01:22:54.950
Yeah! What about Deklin O'Donnel?

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:57.730
Only the tip went in.

01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:03.750
Tremendous news!

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.220
Now, come!

01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:12.510
No, you're grand Thank you, though.

01:23:12.510 --> 01:23:13.730
Come.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.420
No!

01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:16.440
HOld on!

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.910
Martin, do something, would ya?

01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:21.620
I'm not strong enough!

01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:22.660
Oh god!

01:23:26.570 --> 01:23:28.040
Kill it!

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.770
I've seen you about the
town, you filth beast.

01:23:34.770 --> 01:23:36.770
Never liked you mush to b-

01:23:36.770 --> 01:23:39.550
You damned, filthy winged rat!

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:44.040
Just let go, there's no point in all of us
getting dragged into hell!

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.570
I really don't wanna lose you!

01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:50.000
- Oh my god you're having a baby!
- I am!

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.220
Well, there's something that you could do!

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:55.370
If I'm no longer a virgin, I'd be safe!

01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:57.370
- But I-
- YOu know, if we get giddy!

01:23:58.260 --> 01:23:59.260
If we <i>do it</i>!

01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:01.220
Here? like-

01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.220
Better than being gang
banged by demons in hell!

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.480
God, ok!

01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:07.460
Do you know how to do that?

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:08.640
I absolutely don't!

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.750
Just get the fuck down
there and figure it out!

01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:13.370
- You know, normally I do a lot more foreplay!
- Ok.

01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:15.680
But we have limited time
and my good finger is...

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.060
Don't worry about it!

01:24:17.150 --> 01:24:19.240
There's something coming
out of one of the holes!

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:21.240
- It's a baby!
- Definitively!

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:23.240
DO you need me to kind of, uhm...

01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:25.880
Oh, I see what you 're
doing now, yeah, yeah.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:27.880
Oh perfect! Oh thank you

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.260
Alright, yeah.

01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:31.880
He likes it when you cup his balls.

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.040
Hey, Bonnie!

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:35.480
That's a little advice, you know?
Girl to girl.

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.550
Ok!

01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:38.260
What are they doing?

01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:41.330
Oh, we're only doing this
so Rose won't be a virgin!

01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:42.080
What?

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:43.860
And because we're madly in love!

01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:45.860
Kiss me, you fool!

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:49.240
My good eye!

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:53.240
Rose, really? No way! Oh fuuuuuuck!

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.620
You animals! She must remain pure!

01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:59.950
Hey Sarah? Stop him!

01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:18.420
In retrospect, perhaps I
should've just killed the bitch!

01:25:22.110 --> 01:25:23.110
No!

01:25:35.370 --> 01:25:37.220
Oh, thank you Bonnie!

01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:45.080
That is just what I needed.

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:47.080
Look after them for me, would you?

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.710
Not his balls! Martin and Sarah.

01:25:49.710 --> 01:25:50.730
Yeah...

01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:53.640
I didn't for a second
think you meant his balls.

01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:56.240
[And I'll definitively
mind Sarah and Martin.]

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:57.820
Look after his balls too!

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:01.460
Yeah, alright. Bye Bonnie!

01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:07.660
Now I can tell everybody
that my first time was a threesome!

01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:18.750
Oh my god! Could that be possible?
That that's our...

01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:21.310
Oh no... What?

01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:23.910
He's so cute!

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:30.840
Oh my god, Sailor!
Like, how did you manage to do this?

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.200
Brian helped her.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.860
Congratulations, Brain.

01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:40.640
Wow! Hi dotie! Hello baba!

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.640
Rose? he's dying.

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:43.440
Oh my god.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.220
Martin, we need to do it again.

01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:47.750
Wow, relax Rose.
I know you're making up for lost time b-

01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:49.750
NO, I don't mean that. I mean-

01:26:50.730 --> 01:26:52.420
There's a spirit in there?

01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:54.420
I just thought it was a sound bird.

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:58.800
Oh, spirit on the road between life
and death, I call onto you now.

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.680
Open up the gates so that the
living may speak to the dead!

01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:12.860
Rose, girl. It's me.

01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:15.220
Daddy!

01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:17.080
It really is you?

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.400
I'm so so sorry!

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.400
No, Rose. You did nothing wrong!

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.400
Sure you were only a-UhnUhO!

01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:23.620
Child.

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.880
No, I should've saved you.

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:26.880
Rose...

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.220
There's nothing to feel gulty about.

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:33.110
Just, look at all the
people you have just saved!

01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:36.200
Daddy!

01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:37.800
Is it really you?

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:41.040
There's someone I want you to meet!

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:42.710
Oh, Faddie.

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.310
Daddy, I told you never to call me that.

01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:47.310
Yes, sorry! Sailor.

01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:49.310
Look after each other, won't you?

01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:52.820
Of course we will, but daddy,
we just miss you so much!

01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.260
I know, Rose.

01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:56.260
I'll always be watching you two.

01:27:56.730 --> 01:27:59.730
Now, Rose, I'm sorry but I must go.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.400
Fly into the light daddy!

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.400
Fly towards the light, pops!

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.400
I love you!

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:17.710
Rose, you did it!

01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:19.710
- Martin?
- He's free!

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:25.820
Vincent.

01:28:27.150 --> 01:28:28.750
His name is Vincent.

01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:31.040
I think he's hungry.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.800
There's some of Christian's curry sauce
over there, do you reckon he'd eat that?

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.800
No.

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:39.880
Hello?

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:43.910
Oh, sorry to interrupt.

01:28:43.930 --> 01:28:45.330
I have special fried rice here.

01:28:45.330 --> 01:28:47.910
And some free chicken balls
to say sorry for the mix up!

01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:49.350
Yes!

01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:51.350
I am starving!

01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:54.800
Three months later.

01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:07.530
- Heya!
- Hi-i!

01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:09.820
How are you?

01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.060
Well what do you think?

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:14.220
Wow, that looks great!

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:16.040
- Yeah?
- Yeah! Lovely.

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:16.860
It's good, isn't it?

01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:20.080
Yeah! Y-
Extraordinary is one word though.

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:21.640
Oh, is it?

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.330
It's grand, we'll fix it later.

01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:24.330
Oh yeah?

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:30.020
There's... Something I
wanted to talk to you about.

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.400
Well, you know how much you mean
for me and Sarah.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:36.530
Yeah, of course! And that you really like,
mean the world to me as well!

01:29:36.910 --> 01:29:37.910
Well...

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:43.550
Oh my god!

01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:45.240
We could do this earlier.

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:47.200
Rose Dooley-

01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:48.800
Will you marry me?

01:29:51.730 --> 01:29:52.880
No!

01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:56.660
THE END
