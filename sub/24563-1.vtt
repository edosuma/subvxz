[P.I.X.A.L.]
'Your coordinates,
Master Lloyd.'

04:48.375 --> 04:50.725
[Lloyd]
'Whoever they are, they're good.
I need back up.'

- Yeah, I'm here.

- You heard your master.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.182
Work!

06:40.269 --> 06:41.226
phat

06:48.538 --> 06:50.975
You there! Peasant!
Bring me water.

06:52.673 --> 06:54.109
You hear me?

06:54.196 --> 06:56.198
Bring me some water!

06:59.810 --> 07:01.812
Thirsty?

07:01.899 --> 07:03.074
[gasps]
It's..

07:03.161 --> 07:05.076
The Master of Water.
Nya!

07:05.163 --> 07:06.513
I don't care. Get her!

07:15.086 --> 07:17.480
[grunting]

07:21.658 --> 07:24.052
[dramatic music]

07:32.452 --> 07:34.018
Still thirsty?

07:53.995 --> 07:55.953
[screaming]

07:56.040 --> 07:57.477
Cole, you're my friend,
but right now

07:57.564 --> 07:58.869
you're my worst enemy.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.958
You have no idea
how time travel works.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.526
If someone goes back in time
and alters the past

08:03.613 --> 08:06.224
our reality, as we know it
would change.

08:06.311 --> 08:09.793
We could look totally different
and not even know it.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.404
But we don't.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.451
Thus, Master Wu must have
slipped into a time stream

08:15.538 --> 08:16.713
into the future.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.890
Whenever he is,
it's been a year.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.849
It's time we find him.

08:21.936 --> 08:25.330
Uh, hi. Sorry to bother you.
Cole, Master of Earth.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.028
Uh, this is Jay,
master of blabber.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.725
Lighting!

08:28.812 --> 08:31.423
We heard that an old man
who lost his memory

08:31.511 --> 08:34.165
wandered in from the cold,
about so high

08:34.252 --> 08:35.732
long beard and drinks
a lot of tea.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.128
I told you not to introduce
yourself as the Master of Earth.

08:40.215 --> 08:41.825
No one knows what that means.

08:41.912 --> 08:45.394
No, you, bolt head. Everyone
here took a vow of silence.

08:48.353 --> 08:51.400
Can you point us to him?

08:51.487 --> 08:54.490
Thank you. I-I like your place.

09:02.454 --> 09:05.588
Wait, if it's him
and he lost his memory

09:05.675 --> 09:08.896
don't remind him of that stupid
TV show I once hosted, okay?

09:11.551 --> 09:14.118
Uh, Master Wu..

09:23.998 --> 09:27.479
Oh, come on! We came all this
way and it's not him?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.003
Ah! That-that's it. I quit!

09:29.090 --> 09:31.745
I'm tired of losing people
in my life.

09:31.832 --> 09:34.704
Wu would never quit on us
and we're not quitting on him.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.532
If he's really still out there,
couldn't he

09:36.619 --> 09:38.534
at least send a letter
from the future?

09:38.621 --> 09:41.058
Or leave a message
to stand the test of time?

09:41.145 --> 09:42.973
He's wise. He'd find a way.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.366
We just have to keep looking.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.063
Yeah, you do that
and while you're at it

09:46.150 --> 09:48.588
I'll be doing something more
useful, like being a ninja.

09:48.675 --> 09:51.068
Ha! Some ninja you are.
You talk more than you fight.

09:51.155 --> 09:52.940
At least, I'm entertaining,
all you do

09:53.027 --> 09:54.768
is judge and act like you
know everythin--

09:54.855 --> 09:58.336
[yelling]
Would you stop fighting?

09:59.424 --> 10:01.557
Way to break your vow.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.515
- Huh! Oh, no! I spoke too.
- Uh, ha!

10:03.603 --> 10:05.474
I knew you didn't have it
in you.

10:05.561 --> 10:08.085
I've been holding this in

10:08.172 --> 10:11.741
but I just wanna say,
I hate doing your dishes.

10:11.828 --> 10:14.004
Well, if everyone's doin' it,
I'm doin' it too.

10:14.091 --> 10:15.615
[beeping]

10:15.702 --> 10:19.009
Uh-oh! That's our cue.
Gotta run.

10:19.096 --> 10:20.141
[blizzard blowing]

10:22.665 --> 10:24.841
[P.I.X.A.L.]
'Zane,
Master Lloyd requires Kai'

10:24.928 --> 10:26.495
'and your attention
in Ninjago City.'

10:26.582 --> 10:28.279
- Is it serious?
- 'It appears so.'

10:28.366 --> 10:29.324
'Did I catch you at a bad time?'

10:29.411 --> 10:30.891
Zane, a little help?

10:30.978 --> 10:32.501
Calling off the press

10:32.588 --> 10:35.025
the Mechanic is back, Ninjago.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.680
[zapping]

10:37.767 --> 10:39.639
[instrumental music]

10:39.726 --> 10:41.728
Ah, whoever said,
"Fight fire with fire"

10:41.815 --> 10:43.381
didn't know
what they were talkin' about.

10:43.468 --> 10:46.994
- We will be there shortly.
- Watch out for the cross fire.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.736
Hey, you're stealing my lines.

10:49.823 --> 10:50.911
[thudding]

10:50.998 --> 10:52.434
[The Mechanic screams]

10:55.219 --> 10:58.222
Who likes ice cream? I do!

10:58.309 --> 11:01.399
How was that for a last line,
Kai? Can we leave now?

11:01.486 --> 11:03.053
Needs a little work.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.534
You gotta have to give me
a minute to thaw though.

11:07.188 --> 11:10.060
[instrumental music]

11:11.932 --> 11:14.021
[laughter]

11:14.108 --> 11:17.067
Hey, there he is. You're late.

11:17.154 --> 11:20.027
Kai was late too,
if it is any consolation.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.942
Thanks for meeting me here.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.857
It's been a while since we've
all been under one roof.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.162
[laughs]

11:26.468 --> 11:27.599
What?

11:27.687 --> 11:29.689
Are we gonna talk about it?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.081
Talk about what?

11:31.168 --> 11:35.172
- Your voice, it's..
- Lower.

11:35.259 --> 11:38.262
Sounds like
our little ninja's growin' up.

11:38.349 --> 11:40.003
Leave him alone.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.353
[sighs]
Any word from your mother?

11:42.440 --> 11:44.965
Not since she went searching
for Master Wu.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.576
- I don't know where she is.
- She'll come back, Lloyd.

11:47.663 --> 11:49.447
And, so will Wu.

11:49.534 --> 11:52.276
Not everyone comes back, Cole.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.235
But that isn't why
I called you here.

11:54.322 --> 11:55.627
I called you because of this.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.065
[beeping]

11:58.152 --> 12:00.632
Your father, Lord Garmadon?

12:00.720 --> 12:03.723
After poking around, I've
learned it's the symbol to--

12:03.810 --> 12:05.246
The Sons of Garmadon.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.813
The mysterious criminal
syndicate

12:06.900 --> 12:08.902
'growing to prominence
in Ninjago city.'

12:08.989 --> 12:11.992
Seventy-two hours ago,
they stole a powerful relic

12:12.079 --> 12:13.645
from Cyrus Borg.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.605
- Some mask--
- Not some mask.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.348
The Oni Mask.

12:20.435 --> 12:22.742
There are only three
in existence.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.526
Whoa! I'm confused.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.136
How can there be three masks

12:26.223 --> 12:28.486
when you just said
it's the only mask?

12:28.573 --> 12:32.229
Not only, Jay. "Oni!"

12:32.316 --> 12:34.928
The Oni are said to be
all-powerful beings.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.364
Demon that predate Ninjago.

12:36.451 --> 12:40.063
Each mask embodies
one of the three Oni warlords.

12:40.150 --> 12:43.675
If all three masks are united,
whomever owns them

12:43.763 --> 12:47.418
will wield tremendous power.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.812
Ninja, this is Mr. Hutchins.

12:49.899 --> 12:52.902
Master at arms
and counsel to the Royal Family.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.556
- I've asked him here.
- The Royal Family.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.993
Apologies,
if you aren't familiar.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.082
They honor their privacy

12:59.169 --> 13:01.519
as they do the safety
of Ninjago.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.870
Let me guess,
they have an Oni Mask too?

13:03.957 --> 13:05.828
Two? Now, there's two?

13:05.915 --> 13:08.700
The Emperor will be delivering
a public speech tomorrow

13:08.788 --> 13:10.833
and I'm worried
the Sons of Garmadon

13:10.920 --> 13:13.183
may try to steal the mask.

13:13.270 --> 13:15.272
We could use your assistance

13:15.359 --> 13:19.059
that is if you can keep
a low profile.

13:19.146 --> 13:23.019
We're ninja.
No one will know we're there.

13:23.106 --> 13:25.500
Just let us know where and when.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.807
[instrumental music]

13:29.983 --> 13:35.118
[Emperor]
'As many of you know, my family
has kept a private life.'

13:35.205 --> 13:39.122
'We aren't interested in
meddling with current affairs.'

13:39.209 --> 13:44.475
'But as crime has risen,
so has our concern.'

13:44.562 --> 13:47.914
'So, it is time to step out
of the shadows'

13:48.001 --> 13:50.394
and into the light.

13:50.481 --> 13:53.397
[crowd cheering]

13:54.790 --> 13:56.357
I don't like this one bit.

13:56.444 --> 13:58.272
The Royal Family
likes their privacy

13:58.359 --> 14:00.056
why give such a public speech?

14:00.143 --> 14:02.450
I think it's nice. They're
reaching out to the people.

14:02.537 --> 14:05.322
Why all the hate, sis? You just
don't like getting gussied up.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.934
[Nya]
'All that gold and glitter
is for show.'

14:08.021 --> 14:09.283
'The Royal Family
are figure heads.'

14:09.370 --> 14:10.806
'They don't have
any real power.'

14:10.893 --> 14:11.938
'What purpose do they have?'

14:12.025 --> 14:13.940
Their purpose is to be protected

14:14.027 --> 14:15.898
as do all our traditions.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.379
I believe Master Lloyd has
spotted something of interest.

14:18.466 --> 14:21.208
[instrumental music]

14:23.210 --> 14:25.386
[Zane]
'Looks like he's got an eye
for the princess.'

14:25.473 --> 14:27.214
[Kai]
I guess,
green is her favorite color.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.390
You do know I can hear you,
right?

14:29.477 --> 14:31.566
- 'We must..'
- The Emperor's almost finished.

14:31.653 --> 14:32.697
Let's just do our job.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.961
...and always stay united.

14:35.048 --> 14:36.963
[crowd cheering]

14:37.050 --> 14:38.573
Be on the lookout.

14:47.625 --> 14:50.498
[cameras clicking]

14:53.153 --> 14:54.110
I see--

14:54.197 --> 14:55.285
[crackers bursting]

14:55.372 --> 14:58.245
[crowd screaming]

15:02.684 --> 15:03.641
Is the threat clear?

15:03.728 --> 15:06.470
[fireworks crackling]

15:07.602 --> 15:11.171
Huh! Firecrackers! False alarm.

15:11.258 --> 15:14.130
[crowd cheering]

15:17.351 --> 15:19.919
Huh,
you protected the Royal Family.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.573
You have their gratitude.

15:22.660 --> 15:25.185
You're invited to be their
guests in the palace.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.839
Huh, no one ever gets invited
into the palace.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.493
Are you sure they meant us?

15:29.580 --> 15:33.280
It's just a palace. You've seen
one, you've seen 'em all.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.282
We'd be honored.

15:35.369 --> 15:38.241
[instrumental music]

15:48.164 --> 15:50.558
Welcome to the Royal Place

15:50.645 --> 15:53.648
also known
as the "Palace of Secrets."

15:53.735 --> 15:56.868
Ooh, why do they call it
the Palace of Secrets?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.783
Ah, if I were to tell you that

15:58.870 --> 16:01.177
then it wouldn't
be a secret now, would it?

16:01.264 --> 16:03.092
[indistinct chatter]

16:03.179 --> 16:05.834
Look at that.

16:05.921 --> 16:08.097
I already feel royal.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.838
It's beautiful.

16:09.925 --> 16:13.798
Yeah. I could really get used
to living in a place like this.

16:13.885 --> 16:16.714
Well, don't.
We're only here as guests.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.455
Then,
back to protecting Ninjago.

16:20.936 --> 16:23.286
Hmph, too much gold
in my opinion.

16:26.637 --> 16:31.512
I present to you the exalted
Emperor and Empress of Ninjago.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.601
And their daughter

16:33.688 --> 16:35.342
the jade princess

16:35.429 --> 16:37.344
'Princess Harumi.'

16:42.175 --> 16:44.916
We're honored by your presence.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.962
The honor is all ours.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.269
I have read much about you.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.749
Your heroics
will surely become legend.

16:54.491 --> 16:57.364
Kai, the hot-head who acts
without question.

16:59.279 --> 17:03.022
Cole, the rock and foundation
of the team.

17:03.109 --> 17:07.374
Jay, the joker whose mouth
is as fast as lightning.

17:07.461 --> 17:10.507
Zane, the cold
and calculating android.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.335
Nindroid, your highness.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.512
And, Nya, the girl.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.125
The girl I've wanted to be

17:19.212 --> 17:21.605
ever since I first heard
about her.

17:21.692 --> 17:24.217
With her mastery of water
and her skill

17:24.304 --> 17:27.133
that could rival any master.

17:27.220 --> 17:28.960
I like her.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.225
And Master Lloyd,
the green ninja.

17:32.312 --> 17:35.358
'The youngest,
but most powerful protector.'

17:35.445 --> 17:37.012
The chosen one.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.710
I too have lost my parents.

17:39.797 --> 17:42.278
'But we're both
not without family.'

17:42.365 --> 17:45.064
We adopted Harumi
and raised her as our own..

17:45.151 --> 17:46.848
...when her parents passed away.

17:46.935 --> 17:49.372
Thank you for inviting us
into your home.

17:49.459 --> 17:52.506
It wasn't us.
It was our daughter.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.682
And she would like you
to stay with us

17:54.769 --> 17:56.901
until the threat
to our throne is over.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.729
These are troubling times.

17:58.816 --> 18:01.341
'And as long as we have
an Oni Mask'

18:01.428 --> 18:04.083
we fear our lives
are in jeopardy.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.216
The masks
must never be reunited.

18:07.303 --> 18:09.958
Please, say yes.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.526
Then you have our help.

18:12.613 --> 18:15.485
Great, then Mr. Hutchins
can show you the palace.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.749
Yes!

18:18.836 --> 18:21.796
While you're in our service
you have full access

18:21.883 --> 18:24.190
to the complementary
royal buffet.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.148
Anything you want
is at your disposal.

18:26.235 --> 18:29.499
Exotic fruits,
assorted vegetables

18:29.586 --> 18:33.329
scones,
and all you can eat cake.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.723
Ah, thank you,
but I gave up sweets.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.116
My body is a temple.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.726
Ever since
Master Wu went missing

18:38.813 --> 18:40.597
Cole has been
a real party-pooper.

18:40.684 --> 18:41.859
"Party-pooper?"

18:41.946 --> 18:43.383
I'll explain later.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.994
The palace is equipped
with secret passages

18:46.081 --> 18:47.778
to get anywhere fast.

18:47.865 --> 18:51.173
Ah, so that's why they call it
the Palace of Secrets.

18:51.260 --> 18:55.917
Yes, but as to the locations
of the secret passages

18:56.004 --> 18:58.093
only the Royal Family knows.

18:58.180 --> 19:03.011
Sure, you mean,
like, right here?

19:03.098 --> 19:05.056
- Nope.
- Or here?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.536
- Not there.
- 'Or right here?'

19:06.623 --> 19:08.059
- No.
- Then, how about here?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.626
- Here? Or Here?
- 'No. Nope!'

19:09.713 --> 19:11.193
- Ah, here, or this way.
- No. Nope.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.499
- 'Here?'
- Wrong.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.065
- This gotta be it.
- Wrong again.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.067
This is a big one.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.113
- 'Here?'
- No.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.247
Ah, ha, ha. We'll clean up
after ourselves.

19:21.334 --> 19:24.250
[instrumental music]

19:24.337 --> 19:25.555
Anyone else think
there's something

19:25.642 --> 19:27.383
a little off about this guy?

19:27.470 --> 19:30.386
He's holding something back.

19:30.473 --> 19:33.824
And finally,
the reason for your protection.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.435
The Mask of Deception!

19:35.522 --> 19:36.827
[intense music]

19:36.914 --> 19:40.179
Ugh, a face
only a mother could love.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.658
Why would anyone want that?

19:41.745 --> 19:43.443
That's up to us to figure out.

19:43.530 --> 19:46.359
Just being in the same room with
it gives me the heebie-jeebies.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.448
If this is the Mask of Deception

19:48.535 --> 19:50.145
what was stolen
from Borg Industries?

19:50.232 --> 19:51.668
The Mask of Vengeance.

19:51.755 --> 19:53.322
And who has the third one?

19:53.409 --> 19:55.716
No one knows the location
of the Mask of Hatred.

19:55.803 --> 19:57.935
But my sensors tell me
it won't be lost for long.

19:58.022 --> 19:59.589
Zane is correct.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.939
'Though no one has found
the third mask'

20:02.026 --> 20:04.551
'it has given the Royal Family
a little resolve.'

20:04.638 --> 20:07.510
[instrumental music]

20:16.693 --> 20:21.524
But we know dark forces
are looking to acquire it.

20:21.611 --> 20:25.093
And that's why we need eyes
on it at all times.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.661
Don't worry, we're ninja.

20:27.748 --> 20:30.185
We're experts
at this kind of thing.

20:30.272 --> 20:33.188
[instrumental music]

20:33.275 --> 20:34.842
All clear.

20:34.929 --> 20:37.845
You too. Wait! Look.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.241
[tile clattering]

20:46.680 --> 20:48.464
Who's watching who?

20:48.551 --> 20:50.553
Ah! Mm!

20:50.640 --> 20:52.381
Are you sure you don't want any?

20:52.468 --> 20:54.340
This cake is delicious.

20:55.428 --> 20:58.039
Eh, my body is a temple.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.823
[chomping]
Mm.

20:59.910 --> 21:02.522
Well, the buffet is clear
of any threats.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.088
And, they're out of bologna.

21:04.175 --> 21:07.570
Can we discuss now,
what is a "Party-pooper?"

21:07.657 --> 21:10.791
[sighs]
Jay's upset
I'm the responsible one.

21:10.878 --> 21:13.750
With Master Wu gone,
someone has to keep us in check.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.883
In that case,
you are correct.

21:15.970 --> 21:18.102
You are responsible.

21:18.189 --> 21:19.974
It is nice to have a pooper
at the party.

21:20.061 --> 21:22.977
[laughing]

21:26.459 --> 21:29.418
So, you're
the Mask of Deception.

21:29.505 --> 21:30.811
[glass shattering]

21:33.379 --> 21:34.423
Princess?

21:36.556 --> 21:38.427
Princess Harumi?

21:40.603 --> 21:42.344
Are you there?

21:42.431 --> 21:45.304
[eerie music]

21:46.348 --> 21:49.264
[theme music]
