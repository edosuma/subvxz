<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:16.149 --> 00:19.448
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:19.519 --> 00:22.545
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:22.622 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:32.192
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:36.634
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:41.072
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:42.442 --> 00:45.002
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:45.078 --> 00:47.569

that his next leap...</i>

00:47.647 --> 00:49.638

00:58.525 --> 01:02.120
I love you.

01:20.046 --> 01:22.606
You two rabbits ought to be ashamed!

01:22.682 --> 01:27.312
The wedding is tomorrow. And in case you
forgot how to add, that's one more day.

01:27.387 --> 01:30.686
<i>Young lady, your father
is spinnin'in his grave.</i>

01:30.757 --> 01:33.954
Now cover yourself!
And you, Will Kinman,

01:34.027 --> 01:36.154
if you don't get outta here
I'm gonna-

01:36.229 --> 01:39.790
Well, I don't know what
I'm gonna do, but get out!

01:41.234 --> 01:43.168
Will K-Kinman?

01:43.236 --> 01:48.640
Sheriff, you think what, uh, L-Leta Aider
says about that kind of craziness is true?

01:50.376 --> 01:54.437
Wha
- I couldn't wait one more moment to touch you.

02:04.557 --> 02:09.859
<i>You got five minutes to get dressed and get out
of this house, or I'm throwing you out buck naked.</i>

02:09.929 --> 02:12.227
<i>You get him out ofhere.!
You hear me, Abigail Fuller?</i>

02:15.969 --> 02:17.960
Abigail.

02:19.506 --> 02:22.498
Oh, b- Oh, boy.

03:38.518 --> 03:41.112
<i>Last week on Quantum Leap.</i>

03:42.322 --> 03:45.314
Must've scared the hell outta Abigail,
comin' up on a dead man like that.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.918
Abigail Fuller, you told me
he was dead when you come on him.

03:48.995 --> 03:51.793
- Stay away from her, you hear me!
- She watched him die!

03:51.864 --> 03:55.960
Wanting someone dead and-and
killing them are-are two different things.

03:56.035 --> 03:58.469
You didn't kill anyone, Abigail.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.837
I wished Mr. Aider dead, too.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.512
Did you hit Mr. Aider?
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.778
Unless you tell me what happened,
I can't help you. I didn't kill him!

04:11.851 --> 04:13.842
I didn't kill either of'em!

04:13.920 --> 04:19.380
Do you think that Abigail-
a little girl like Abigail-

04:19.459 --> 04:21.950
could be capable of murder?

04:22.028 --> 04:23.825
No!
It was you who killed her, Abigail!

04:23.896 --> 04:27.423
I didn't kill her!

04:35.074 --> 04:38.168
Don't come back this way. She's
comin' up the stairs. Hurry up!

04:38.244 --> 04:40.576
Find a place to hide!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

04:45.652 --> 04:47.711
Yeah. Oh, good. Good,
that's a good place to hide!

04:47.787 --> 04:50.551
Okay. Now, don't make a peep,
Abigail! Not a peep!

04:54.127 --> 04:56.288
<i>- Abigail.!
- Sam, she's hiding!</i>

04:56.362 --> 04:59.195
Where is she? She's upstairs in the
cabinet, and Leta's right next to her!

04:59.265 --> 05:03.031
<i>No.! No.! Get away.!
L- I'll kill you.! I'll kill you all.!</i>

05:03.102 --> 05:05.866
Hurry up!

05:05.938 --> 05:08.907
<i>- Abigail!
- Hurry up, Sam.! Hurry up.!</i>

05:08.975 --> 05:11.205
<i>- Hurry up.!
- Daddy!</i>

05:11.277 --> 05:13.302
<i>- I'm coming.!
- Help, Daddy.!</i>

05:13.379 --> 05:16.837
<i>- Hang on! Hang on!
- He's comin'! Hurry up.!</i>

05:16.916 --> 05:18.975
<i>Come on. Through the flames.!
That's it.!</i>

05:20.987 --> 05:22.921
Come on. It's okay.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.287
<i>Hurry up.!</i>

05:26.292 --> 05:28.590
<i>Put her on the roof.
She'll be all right out there.</i>

05:28.661 --> 05:30.754
<i>Okay.
Get Daddy out! Get Daddy!</i>

05:30.830 --> 05:33.355
No. He'll be
- He'll be right behind us. He'll be okay, Abigail.

05:33.433 --> 05:36.561
Sam! Look out!

05:47.947 --> 05:51.678
<i>I b-better go.</i>

05:51.751 --> 05:55.380
Only because I know that...

05:55.455 --> 05:58.481
after tomorrow, you're
gonna belong to me forever.

05:59.992 --> 06:02.085
Promise me, Will.

06:02.161 --> 06:05.392
Promise me
you'll be mine forever.

06:06.399 --> 06:10.859
I... promise you that Will Kinman
will never leave you.

06:10.937 --> 06:13.064
Ohh! Mm!

06:13.139 --> 06:15.699
<i>You got 30 seconds.!</i>

06:20.046 --> 06:23.072
After tomorrow, there's not
anybody that can keep us apart.

06:28.688 --> 06:32.283
<i>I said, out.!</i>

06:32.358 --> 06:34.883
Just take your skinny, pale behind
out of here...

06:34.961 --> 06:37.828
<i>fore I call yo'mama and tell her
what you've been up to.</i>

06:37.897 --> 06:41.594
Come on. Just get out! Get out!
Get-Get-Get out of here!

06:47.640 --> 06:50.939
I love you, Will Kinman!

06:51.010 --> 06:53.672
<i>Will you close this window?</i>

06:53.746 --> 06:56.681
Do you want the whole town to know
what a wicked child you are?

06:56.749 --> 07:01.243
I'm not wicked, and I'm not a child.

07:01.320 --> 07:06.121
And tomorrow, I'm gonna be
Mrs. Willis Gunnerson Kinman.

07:06.192 --> 07:09.992
Deputy Willis Gunnerson Kinman's
brand-new wife.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.733
I won't have to be
alone anymore, Marie.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.162
Not ever.

07:21.073 --> 07:23.132
Oh, you! Go to bed
and get some sleep.

07:28.347 --> 07:31.748
I can't b-be back here.
I mean, Marie and Abiga-

07:35.855 --> 07:38.653
Abigail all grown up.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.189
And the house.

07:44.263 --> 07:48.757
The house that was on f-fire.
L- I changed history.

07:48.835 --> 07:54.398
She's alive. She's alive.
Abigail is alive.

07:54.474 --> 07:59.673
There was a... fire
and a w-window and...

08:00.713 --> 08:04.205
she got out, and I didn't.

08:08.187 --> 08:10.121
But I'm alive.

08:10.189 --> 08:15.559
I'm alive and I'm-I'm back here
as Will Kinman.

08:15.628 --> 08:18.358
Why?

08:18.431 --> 08:20.831
Why am I back here?

08:22.502 --> 08:25.369
<i>Does not make any sense at all.</i>

08:25.438 --> 08:27.372
What doesn't make
any sense at all?

08:27.440 --> 08:32.207
To whom are you talking? People are gonna
think you're cuckoo walkin' around like this.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.576
He's dead.
Who's dead?

08:34.647 --> 08:37.980
Clayton Fuller's dead.
Yeah.

08:38.049 --> 08:42.179
I leaped and he died.

08:42.255 --> 08:45.850
And I leaped into-

08:45.925 --> 08:49.520
Into?
Um, in-

08:51.764 --> 08:54.028
Huh?

08:54.100 --> 08:56.568
You mean, you leaped into-
I leaped in-

08:56.636 --> 09:00.834
Do you- Do you realize
where I I-leaped into?

09:00.907 --> 09:04.070
Yeah. Pottersville, Lou- No,
that's not what I m-meant.

09:04.143 --> 09:09.809
You're stuttering. Yeah. Well, I think
it's a little r-residual from W-Will.

09:09.882 --> 09:13.579
She's incredible, Al.

09:13.653 --> 09:17.111
Her eyes and her face
and her hair.

09:17.189 --> 09:20.750
The way it smells, and-
Mm-hmm?

09:20.826 --> 09:24.660
Her s-skin, when you-
Okay, okay. Whoa, cowboy.

09:24.730 --> 09:28.564
Oh, boy. I know you leaped in here
in sort of intimate circumstances.

09:28.634 --> 09:30.602
But you gotta be careful.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.604
Careful?
Well, listen to yourself.

09:32.672 --> 09:35.300
It's Will that's in love
with Abigail, not Sam. I know.

09:35.374 --> 09:38.434
L- I know that, I know that.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.480
She's so beautiful, Al. When you see
- Uh, okay. Okay.

09:41.547 --> 09:46.075
It's June 14, 1966,
and you've leaped back...

09:46.152 --> 09:48.746
into Pottersville, Louisiana.

09:48.821 --> 09:52.587
That's all we've got right now.
It's 11 years I-I-later.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.819
Abigail's 21.
Yeah. That's right.

09:54.894 --> 09:59.729
And, uh, Will is 27.
I feel like I'm 27.

09:59.799 --> 10:04.964
I f-feel like I'm 17.
And I'm getting m-married tomorrow.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.471
No. Will is-
Will is getting m-m-

10:07.540 --> 10:09.531
I gotta get you out of here.
I belong here.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.442
You got me worried big time. All right,
Gooshie. What are you worried about?

10:12.511 --> 10:15.708
Let's get to work on this.
Sam, do me a favor. What?

10:15.781 --> 10:20.741
Stay away from Abigail.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.879
Okay?
Okay.

10:28.728 --> 10:30.719
<i>It had been 11 years,</i>

10:30.796 --> 10:34.823
<i>and Abigail had grown from a frightened
child into a glorious young woman.</i>

10:34.900 --> 10:40.099
<i>Al's request to stay away from her was as absurd
as asking the sun not to rise on their wedding day.</i>

10:40.172 --> 10:42.163
<i>I know you're gonna be here, Al.</i>

10:42.241 --> 10:46.177
The question is, how close to the wire
are you gonna- put me?

10:50.216 --> 10:52.912
I know it's bad luck for the groom
to see a bride before the wedding,

10:52.985 --> 10:55.749
but I don't believe in anything bad
ever happening to us.

10:55.821 --> 10:59.518
Ever! Do you like it?

10:59.592 --> 11:04.222
Do you really, really like it? You look
more b-beautiful every time I see you.

11:04.296 --> 11:08.824
I hope you're still sayin' that when I'm
80 years old and puttin' my teeth in your glass.

11:08.901 --> 11:12.837
I'll say it every day I'm allowed
to I-look at you.

11:14.740 --> 11:19.973
Close your eyes. Don't you know
it's bad luck for the groom...

11:20.046 --> 11:22.139
to see the bride
before the wedding?

11:22.214 --> 11:24.478
I don't believe in bad luck,
and neither does Will.

11:24.550 --> 11:28.816
Well, you should, 'cause ain't no good
comin' from the things you been doin' lately.

11:28.888 --> 11:33.086
<i>Will, I gotta talk to you for a minute.</i>

11:33.159 --> 11:36.390
Looks like there's some trouble
brewing outside, and-Abigail.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.953
- Sorry, I didn't know you were in here.
- She's not.

11:39.031 --> 11:41.898
She was just leavin', 'cause it's bad luck
for the groom to see the bride.

11:41.967 --> 11:43.901
All right, all right. I'm goin'.

11:43.969 --> 11:46.597
I don't want any trouble touchin'
my Will on our wedding day.

11:46.672 --> 11:50.574
Yeah. Well, tell you the truth, Abigail, I
think you better stay right here because, uh-

11:50.643 --> 11:53.203
<i>We got trouble, Sam.
Well, this concerns you, I'm afraid.</i>

11:53.279 --> 11:57.648
<i>- What's the p-problem? - It looks like
you're gonna have a witch hunt on your hands.</i>

11:57.717 --> 12:00.948
<i>Well, seems Don Takins's boy
has disappeared.</i>

12:01.020 --> 12:03.887
Oh, Lord. Disappeared?
What do you mean?

12:03.956 --> 12:06.151
What's this g-got to do with Abigail?

12:06.225 --> 12:09.786
Well, according to Ms. Takins, Abigail
was the last person to see her son.

12:09.862 --> 12:13.491
I was there, but I wasn't
the last one to see him.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.830
<i>She was with me last night.
Sam, watch it.</i>

12:15.901 --> 12:18.699
It's 1966 in a small Southern town.

12:18.771 --> 12:22.832
She w-was with m-me last night.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.342
<i>Till midnight, and then he went home.</i>

12:26.479 --> 12:30.438
Abigail, did you sit
the Takins boy last night?

12:30.516 --> 12:34.350
<i>Yes, but I left at 9:30.
Mr. And Mrs. Takins came home.</i>

12:34.420 --> 12:36.650
- They paid me, and then I left.
- And where was Pervis?

12:36.722 --> 12:39.418
Uh,

12:39.492 --> 12:41.585
well, he got upset...

12:41.660 --> 12:44.185
and went up to his room
at about 8:45.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.790
Why was he upset? He was jealous.
He didn't want me to marry you.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.858
He's seven years old, for heaven's sakes.

12:49.935 --> 12:54.531
I tried to explain to him that we were
grownups and that we were in love.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.509
But he just got upset.
Ran off to his room and wouldn't come out.

12:58.577 --> 13:02.013
<i>He must have run away or something,
and everybody's blaming Abigail.</i>

13:02.081 --> 13:05.676
Ziggy says you're here to control things
until they find the kid.

13:05.751 --> 13:08.652
We-
We find him.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.349
- Yes.
- Yeah, well, they haven't found him yet,

13:11.423 --> 13:15.883
so I suggest that the two of you get across
the street and talk to Mr. And Mrs. Takins.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.952
I've got a church
full of people out there.

13:18.030 --> 13:22.865
<i>Abigail, half those people are outside my office
right now waitin'on what to do to find that boy.</i>

13:23.869 --> 13:26.201
<i>I suggest you put your
personal life on the shelf.</i>

13:26.272 --> 13:29.469
- We'll figure this thing out.
- Sam, I think you better make an announcement...

13:29.542 --> 13:33.273
<i>to those people, because this is gonna take some time. L
- I better...</i>

13:34.880 --> 13:39.112
go tell all the p-people what's-
No, no, no. I'll do it.

13:39.185 --> 13:42.120
I'll do it. I want everyone to know
that I've not done anything wrong.

13:42.188 --> 13:46.147
<i>Well, you do that. But then the two of
you get across the street, all right?</i>

13:47.626 --> 13:53.394
Honey, you better start believin' in
bad luck, 'cause it sure believes in you.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.261
This can't be happenin'. Not today.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.502
Everything's gonna be just fine.
We're gonna find him, aren't we?

14:03.576 --> 14:05.942
I would die if something
happened to that little boy.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.536
We are gonna f-find him,

14:08.614 --> 14:12.948
and then we're gonna get married
just as soon as you can say-

14:13.018 --> 14:16.454
Jackrabbit.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.548
Okay?
Now, I promise.

14:20.759 --> 14:22.727
Get goin'.
I'll see you in the front.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.786
Okay. Get goin'.

14:27.099 --> 14:29.033
<i>Al, what happens?</i>

14:29.101 --> 14:31.433
Well, the whole town
is after her, Sam.

14:31.503 --> 14:36.372
We don't have much because of the '71
flood, but according to a letter...

14:36.442 --> 14:38.376
<i>that Will wrote to
the New Orleans Gazette,</i>

14:38.444 --> 14:43.404
Will said that they turned into a crazed
mob when they couldn't find this kid Pervis.

14:43.482 --> 14:45.814
And tomorrow night,
they try to hang Abigail.

14:45.885 --> 14:51.221
What do you mean, "they try"? Well, in
the frenzy, she got shot in the back.

15:06.972 --> 15:11.102
<i>There's no reason for a boy
to react to a woman that way.</i>

15:11.176 --> 15:14.407
<i>All right. Come on, Ms. Takins.
Just tell us what happened.</i>

15:14.480 --> 15:16.471
<i>When I went to his room,
he was cryin;</i>

15:16.548 --> 15:19.984
<i>I tried to talk to him,
but he wouldn't. Hejust cried.</i>

15:20.052 --> 15:22.282
I held him till
he cried hisself to sleep.

15:22.354 --> 15:26.518
All I told him was I wasn't gonna be able to
sit for him, 'cause I was goin' on my honeymoon,

15:26.592 --> 15:29.356
<i>and he pitched a fit
and broke that little teapot.</i>

15:29.428 --> 15:34.593
Pervis had a crush on Abigail. Just figured it was
a seven-year-old's fascination with a pretty girl.

15:34.667 --> 15:39.434
- I told him I was comin' back, but he wouldn't listen.
- Pervis told me you were his only friend.

15:39.505 --> 15:43.839
<i>- Now why would a child say that?
- Pervis didn't have any friends.</i>

15:43.909 --> 15:47.868
- Pervis had plenty of friends.
- The kids use to tease him...

15:47.947 --> 15:50.780
'cause you owned the funeral parlor.

15:50.849 --> 15:53.010
- They said he smelled like dead people.
- That's a lie!

15:53.085 --> 15:57.715
Kids can be pretty c-cruel at that age.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.951
He used to tell you he had
lots of friends, but he didn't.

16:00.025 --> 16:02.550
You sayin' my boy lied to me!
I'm sayin'...

16:02.628 --> 16:06.064
he was a lonely little boy
who needed a friend.

16:06.131 --> 16:10.534
And if you know so much about my son,
then why don't you tell me where he is?

16:10.602 --> 16:13.571
Maybe if you spent a little more time
with Pervis, he wouldn't have to run away.

16:13.639 --> 16:18.235
<i>I am a workin'mother. My daddy didn't leave
me an insurance policy to waste away...</i>

16:18.310 --> 16:20.335
- on my every whim!
- You didn't have a daddy!

16:20.412 --> 16:22.403
<i>All right, all right.
Look, look please.</i>

16:22.481 --> 16:26.577
- Please.
- All I'm sayin' is, she needs to learn a little about being a mother.

16:26.652 --> 16:32.386
<i>- This is not the time- - Why don't you have
your own children, and stay away from mine?</i>

16:32.458 --> 16:35.894
Or are you afraid they'll be as crazy
as you and your mama?

16:35.961 --> 16:39.192
<i>All right now. All right. Wait, wait, wait. Nowjust
- Please.</i>

16:39.264 --> 16:43.064
None of this is gonna
help us find Pervis.

16:43.135 --> 16:46.536
If we can all just calm down, okay?

16:46.605 --> 16:49.301
We'll figure out what
- I will not have her talk to me like that!

16:49.375 --> 16:51.366
Abigail, sit down.

16:51.443 --> 16:53.377
<i>Look, this isn't gettin'us anywhere.</i>

17:00.619 --> 17:06.523
Now, when did you r-realize
that Pervis was gone?

17:06.592 --> 17:10.028
- Not till he didn't come down for breakfast.
- And you called all his friends?

17:10.095 --> 17:14.191
Abigail's right.

17:14.266 --> 17:16.757
Pervis didn't have no friends.

17:18.737 --> 17:22.263
<i>Did you s-search the house?</i>

17:22.340 --> 17:26.175
- You know, sometimes-
- Will. Will. Will, I swear to God.

17:26.244 --> 17:29.078
I've never seen you
so take-charge in all my days.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.639
<i>Now, Will's right.
If the child's feeling's are hurt-</i>

17:31.717 --> 17:35.710
We searched the house. What are
we gonna do to find my boy, Sheriff?

17:35.788 --> 17:37.983
What was Pervis wearing the last
time anybody saw him?

17:38.057 --> 17:42.994
<i>- He was in his pajamas, but-
- M-Maybe you should go back home...</i>

17:43.062 --> 17:45.826
and see if any of his
f- favorite clothes are gone.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.891
You know,
like a j-jacket or a pair of jeans.

17:49.968 --> 17:53.529
Pervis wasn't like that.
He didn't have favorite-

17:53.605 --> 17:57.097
He loved that red gabardine jacket
I brought him from New Orleans.

17:57.176 --> 17:59.474
Well, that's too small,
and I threw it away.

17:59.545 --> 18:04.448
He had me pull it out of the trash.
He kept it under his toy chest.

18:08.053 --> 18:11.022
<i>Well, I'll go home and check right now.</i>

18:14.393 --> 18:17.920
<i>If anything happens to my boy-</i>

18:21.834 --> 18:24.359
All right. Now I'll get the search
parties organized out front.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.030
- Mr. Takins, why don't you come with me?
- What about my wedding?

18:27.106 --> 18:31.202
Your weddin'? You can get married
any day of your life, missy.

18:31.276 --> 18:34.803
Right now I want you to stop thinkin' about
yourself and start worryin' about that little boy.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.973
All right. You comin'?

18:37.049 --> 18:39.984
Yeah. Just give me
a m-moment.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.043
All right.

18:45.858 --> 18:50.227
Why is this happening again?
L- It's not happening again.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.492
Yes, it is. It's Violet all over again.
I saw the way those people looked at me.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.556
<i>I've seen that before, Will.</i>

18:55.634 --> 18:57.727
I understand.
You hear?

18:57.803 --> 18:59.794
<i>Yeah, we'll find him.</i>

19:03.575 --> 19:06.567
<i>Will? What is it?</i>

19:06.645 --> 19:09.580
N- Nobody's blaming you, Abigail.

19:12.384 --> 19:14.352
<i>What is it, Will?
That woman.!</i>

19:14.419 --> 19:18.355
<i>- She's the one who started the fire.
- Will, let's not start this up again, please.</i>

19:18.423 --> 19:20.357
She tried to k-kill you.
It doesn't matter anymore.

19:20.425 --> 19:22.825
But it does. It does m-matter.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.591
You and I matter.

19:25.664 --> 19:29.691
Will, we almost made it.
We will m-make it.

19:29.768 --> 19:33.932
We will find that little Takins boy...

19:34.006 --> 19:38.443
and we'll have a b-beautiful wedding.

19:44.883 --> 19:48.751
Will, can I tell you
something wonderful?

19:49.821 --> 19:53.882
I like w-wonderful.
Last night, when we made love?

19:57.796 --> 19:59.957
At first...

20:00.032 --> 20:02.830
I thought, this isn't right.

20:02.901 --> 20:05.028
You know, I thought maybe-

20:05.103 --> 20:09.096
maybe all these years,
I'd been wrong about you and I.

20:09.174 --> 20:14.271
But then, something happened.
W- What happened?

20:14.346 --> 20:17.975
I know it was our first time
and everything, but...

20:19.785 --> 20:23.482
when we started,
everything just seemed so-

20:24.523 --> 20:26.457
so wrong.

20:26.525 --> 20:29.426
And then-

20:29.494 --> 20:32.258
All of a sudden you were-

20:34.733 --> 20:36.667
you were different.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.966
Y- You're imagining things.

20:40.038 --> 20:43.098
I'm-I'm sure it was just-
Which is wonderful.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.666
I was like in a magic flash.
We just-

20:45.744 --> 20:49.771
We fit, Will. I mean, our bodies
were made to be together.

20:49.848 --> 20:53.147
As if we were meant to be
in each other's arms for all time.

20:53.218 --> 20:56.710
I know you like I've never known
anyone my whole life.

20:59.558 --> 21:04.495
And I love you. I love you.

21:09.701 --> 21:12.192
<i>Will Kinman, get out here.!</i>

21:13.672 --> 21:16.106
Why don't you c-call the church...

21:16.174 --> 21:20.838
and tell the reverend
that we won't make it t-today.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.842
We won't make it today.

21:25.917 --> 21:29.011
Okay. Will.

21:29.087 --> 21:32.284
Come to me tonight,
no matter what time.

21:32.357 --> 21:35.326
I'll wait for you.

21:46.138 --> 21:50.700
She knows.
She doesn't kn-know anything.

21:50.776 --> 21:53.745
She doesn't. I just heard what she said.
She felt it from the minute you leaped in.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.940
She knows it wasn't just Will she
was with last night. All right, Al.

21:57.015 --> 22:00.974
Just tell me w-what happened
to the Takins boy?

22:01.053 --> 22:04.716
Oh, he gets found tomorrow
morning at 11:00. That's g-great!

22:04.790 --> 22:06.883
Great? Abigail
still gets killed tonight.

22:06.958 --> 22:11.395
That's not so great. But I'll just
tell the p-people where he is and-and-

22:11.463 --> 22:14.193
No, no. You can't do that, 'cause
we don't know where he is right now.

22:14.266 --> 22:18.202
We only know where he is when he gets
found. And we still don't know when that is.

22:18.270 --> 22:20.898
Do you remember Leta Aider?

22:20.972 --> 22:23.907
The w-woman who started
the fire I almost d-died in?

22:23.975 --> 22:27.240
I just saw her outside.

22:27.312 --> 22:32.648
You did? And-And Abigail said
that they didn't b-believe her.

22:32.718 --> 22:35.448
Look, I want you to go back
to the waiting room...

22:35.520 --> 22:38.216
and ask W-Will...

22:38.290 --> 22:41.851
if he can remember anything
that happened on t-that night.

22:41.927 --> 22:45.658
Okay. You know, he's not one of the clearest
people we've ever had in the waiting room.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.757
Just ask Ziggy...

22:48.834 --> 22:51.928
to find out what happened
to L-Leta Aider.

22:54.272 --> 22:56.263
<i>Okay.</i>

23:00.278 --> 23:02.610
<i>The search for Pervis went on for hours.</i>

23:02.681 --> 23:07.141
<i>And even though Al and Ziggy said
he'd be found, I knew I had to keep looking.</i>

23:07.219 --> 23:09.847
<i>Not because I didn't believe them,
but because...</i>

23:09.921 --> 23:11.980
<i>I knew if I went back,
it would be to Abigail.</i>

23:12.057 --> 23:16.585
<i>I sure as hell hope we find this boy.
Last thing in the world I need...</i>

23:16.661 --> 23:20.859
is for my Sheryl Lynn to have anything
more to gossip about your Abigail.

23:23.402 --> 23:27.202
<i>Hey, Stanton. Why don't you and Will
take the Lebeau farm?</i>

23:27.272 --> 23:29.263
All right. All right. I'm headed.

23:29.341 --> 23:32.833
Let me stop up here and get somethin' to
drink first. Then I head over that way.

23:38.049 --> 23:40.483
Here ya go.
Thank you.

23:40.552 --> 23:44.283
Thank you.

23:46.191 --> 23:50.594
You should be grateful, Will.
Why should I be grateful, Ms. Aider?

23:50.662 --> 23:55.429
Don't you see, it happened for a
reason. What are you t-talking about?

23:55.500 --> 24:00.870
The weddin'. My wedding's got n
- nothing to do with you.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.998
It's in her blood, Will.

24:03.074 --> 24:05.872
Like her mama,
and her mama's mama.

24:05.944 --> 24:09.209
You know that as well as
everybody else in Potter Parish.

24:09.281 --> 24:14.878
What happened with Abigail's g- grandmother
has n-nothing to do with Abigail.

24:14.953 --> 24:18.047
She's cursed, Will.
Her own mother knew it.

24:18.123 --> 24:23.220
It drove her insane. You don't know what
happened to Laura Fuller anymore than I do.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.526
I know she was crazy.
I know they locked her away.

24:26.598 --> 24:30.967
Most of all, I know the whole
Lanchette family was cursed.

24:31.036 --> 24:36.702
They bore one every generation.
First Teresa, then Rhetta, now Abigail.

24:36.775 --> 24:40.905
She can't help what's
in her blood, Will, but you can.

24:40.979 --> 24:45.006
I don't believe in curses.
Tell that to my husband.

24:45.083 --> 24:47.881
And my little girl.

24:47.953 --> 24:51.912
Your daughter, Violet, was killed
by a pack of wild dogs.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.857
And your husband, Bart,
had a heart attack.

24:54.926 --> 24:58.987
<i>Now you c-can't bring them back,</i>

24:59.064 --> 25:02.591
but n-neither can blamin' Abigail.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.227
<i>It's all in the past.</i>

25:05.303 --> 25:07.430
Pervis Takins ain't the past.
He's the present.

25:07.506 --> 25:11.533
<i>And you are gonna have to live with the
future. And you know what that future is?</i>

25:11.610 --> 25:15.603
A lifetime of sleepless nights
watchin', waitin',

25:15.680 --> 25:18.410
fearin' for your life
and the life of your children.

25:18.483 --> 25:22.419
Well, none of that
matters now anyway.

25:22.487 --> 25:26.856
What matters is the truth. And the truth
is, Laura's daughter killed my daughter.

25:26.925 --> 25:29.758
That's why she was there.
She should've been locked away.

25:29.828 --> 25:33.730
Abigail's not gonna be I-locked away.

25:33.798 --> 25:36.631
No, this time she'll go to the electric
chair for killing that little boy.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.067
<i>But he's not d-dead.</i>

25:39.137 --> 25:42.197
He's hungry and he's f-frightened,

25:42.274 --> 25:45.766
but he's not... dead.

25:45.844 --> 25:49.541
Wild dogs sound
hungry today, don't they?

25:49.614 --> 25:52.549
Maybe you should go find
that little boy's body.

25:52.617 --> 25:56.314
- That's what you'll have to live with.
- And how do you live with it?

25:56.388 --> 26:00.381
<i>Abigail Fuller is not my cross to bear.
No.</i>

26:00.458 --> 26:04.588
But the m-murder of Clayton Fuller is.

26:04.663 --> 26:07.461
<i>I didn't kill Clayton Fuller.</i>

26:07.532 --> 26:11.696
<i>You set the f-fire that k-killed him.</i>

26:11.770 --> 26:15.900
You know that, and I know that.

26:17.375 --> 26:20.105
I'm a bitter woman...

26:20.178 --> 26:22.169
who's lost everything that's dear to me,

26:23.481 --> 26:25.813
but I did not set that fire.

26:27.819 --> 26:30.583
Ask Laura Fuller.

26:36.962 --> 26:40.728
<i>I had gone to see Laura Fuller before
looking for answers.</i>

26:40.799 --> 26:42.824
<i>She had said nothing.</i>

26:42.901 --> 26:48.168
<i>Now, 11 years later I had come back,
hoping for... something.</i>

26:48.239 --> 26:52.437
<i>A glimmer of the truth.
Was Leta right?</i>

26:52.510 --> 26:55.536
<i>Was Laura there that night?
Had she come to save her Abigail?</i>

27:03.521 --> 27:06.183
Is Abigail with you?

27:09.561 --> 27:11.756
She hasn't come...

27:11.830 --> 27:15.561
to see me lately, you know?

27:18.336 --> 27:23.399
Well, she was supposed
to get m-married today.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.342
You remember?

27:28.613 --> 27:31.446
Ask her to bring me some flowers.

27:34.586 --> 27:37.316
I love it when
she brings me flowers.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.217
Okay.

27:42.761 --> 27:48.199
I need you to remember
something for m-me.

27:48.266 --> 27:50.666
Careful, Sam.

27:51.936 --> 27:55.997
I need you to remember
what happened that n-night.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.541
They all died.

28:08.753 --> 28:11.881
- Died?
- She must know Clayton died.

28:11.956 --> 28:16.154
Cassy, Taylor,

28:19.297 --> 28:21.288
Sadie and Bobby...

28:24.869 --> 28:28.669
and Marylou and Jessie.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.445
All of them.

28:35.513 --> 28:39.108
- That's her brothers and sisters.
- What happened to them?

28:39.184 --> 28:41.584
And Mama did it.

28:42.787 --> 28:45.984
<i>But it wasn't her fault.</i>

28:48.793 --> 28:51.626
She gets so sad.

28:54.132 --> 28:56.623
<i>Daddy went away and then...</i>

28:58.503 --> 29:01.870
the rain came and then...

29:01.940 --> 29:05.341
she cried and she cried.

29:06.711 --> 29:09.111
What did your m-mother do?

29:09.180 --> 29:12.343
Did she hurt th-the children?

29:12.417 --> 29:16.285
<i>Just there wasn't enough food.</i>

29:16.354 --> 29:21.417
And Jessie- He was so little and...

29:21.493 --> 29:23.984
he was so hungry.

29:24.062 --> 29:29.830
<i>- God, she must've seen it all.
- Rained all night.</i>

29:29.901 --> 29:31.869
I love the rain.

29:33.338 --> 29:35.431
<i>I used to sleep with...</i>

29:35.507 --> 29:38.533
Sadie and Marylou...

29:40.178 --> 29:44.012
and I'd always fall in the crack...

29:44.082 --> 29:46.448
and roll under the bed.

29:48.353 --> 29:51.845
That's how
your m-mother missed you.

29:52.857 --> 29:55.348
<i>I thought that it was...</i>

29:55.426 --> 29:59.453
raindrops that I was feelin',

29:59.531 --> 30:01.522
fallin' on my hand.

30:01.599 --> 30:06.059
<i>You tell Abigail.</i>

30:06.137 --> 30:08.071
<i>You tell her that...</i>

30:08.139 --> 30:12.872
that's why I couldn't come home.

30:12.944 --> 30:17.677
<i>Clayton said that I'm gonna hurt her.</i>

30:21.119 --> 30:24.452
You're gonna keep her safe.

30:24.522 --> 30:26.513
Now.

30:26.591 --> 30:29.754
That's what you came back for,
isn't it?

30:29.828 --> 30:33.889
What do you mean,
why I "came back"?

30:33.965 --> 30:37.423
- She knows you're not Will.
- How do you know that I'm-

30:37.502 --> 30:40.733
She really needs you.

30:45.777 --> 30:49.440
<i>Laura. L-Laura?</i>

30:49.514 --> 30:52.915
<i>Sam. Sam, she's right.</i>

30:52.984 --> 30:57.250
<i>You've got to get back to town...</i>

30:57.322 --> 31:01.053
<i>and set up a guard
at Abigail's front door.</i>

31:03.027 --> 31:07.896
I, uh-
I c-can't do that, Al.

31:07.966 --> 31:09.957
<i>You can't?
What do you mean you can't?</i>

31:10.034 --> 31:12.969
- They're gonna lynch her.
- Why do you t-think I'm r-really here?

31:13.037 --> 31:18.100
Oh, Sam, you're here to keep
Abigail from getting killed.

31:18.176 --> 31:20.576
<i>It's a leap like any other leap.</i>

31:20.645 --> 31:22.636
B- But what if there's more?

31:22.714 --> 31:26.150
I mean, what if that's n-not it?

31:26.217 --> 31:28.651
What if there's-

31:28.720 --> 31:32.554
I'm in trouble, Al.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.649
What trouble?
I don't know...

31:34.726 --> 31:37.991
what to do, I-

31:38.062 --> 31:42.999
I want her.
I want her so bad, it's killing me.

31:43.067 --> 31:46.867
I can't think about
anything else except...

31:46.938 --> 31:50.271
h- holding her and-and touching her...

31:50.341 --> 31:53.174
and tasting her and smelling her.

31:53.244 --> 31:57.010
I feel like she belongs to me.

31:58.016 --> 32:01.042
And that's all that m-matters.

32:01.119 --> 32:04.816
What matters is
that you are Sam Beckett.

32:04.889 --> 32:08.518
That's the reason
that you got this crazy job.

32:12.397 --> 32:15.264
- It's not fair.
- All right! It's not fair. It's not fair!

32:15.333 --> 32:17.358
<i>Life isn't fair.
Who ever said it was fair?</i>

32:17.435 --> 32:20.871
Oh, don't s-stand there
and tell me that life isn't fair, Al.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.635
You're here to save Abigail.
You saved her once before.

32:23.708 --> 32:27.200
You've got to do it again. That's it! W
- Why me?

32:29.781 --> 32:32.614
Because you're a hero.

32:40.591 --> 32:43.492
Even heroes are human.

33:19.230 --> 33:22.529
Abigail! Abigail!

33:22.600 --> 33:24.830
Will?

33:31.342 --> 33:33.401
Abigail.

34:04.742 --> 34:07.802
<i>Get up off that bed, boy.!</i>

34:07.879 --> 34:10.643
<i>Get up.! Get up outta there.!</i>

34:10.715 --> 34:13.650
Will! Will!

34:13.717 --> 34:15.708
Will!
Cover yourself!

34:18.556 --> 34:21.821
Now let's see-
let's see if Satan can save you now!

34:32.303 --> 34:35.397
<i>Sam, get up.! Get up, Sam.!</i>

34:35.473 --> 34:37.964
They've taken Abigail
and they're gonna hang her!

34:38.042 --> 34:41.068
Sam, you gotta get up.
You've changed history.

34:41.145 --> 34:43.409
Will was here last time,
and they didn't hang her.

34:43.481 --> 34:48.578
But he isn't here now, and neither are you- especially
if you don't get up! Those yo-yo's are gonna lynch her!

34:54.425 --> 34:57.792
<i>How many more have to die
before we seejustice?</i>

34:57.862 --> 35:00.797
<i>Yeah.!</i>

35:00.865 --> 35:04.130
<i>Gooshie, what's going on?
How much time has she got?</i>

35:04.202 --> 35:07.729
Twelve minutes! Damn it!
It's my fault.

35:07.805 --> 35:11.832
I should have stayed.
How long before Sam comes around?

35:11.909 --> 35:14.377
Ah, that could be too late.

35:14.445 --> 35:18.438
Gooshie, center me on Abigail,
and figure out a way to find that kid!

35:18.516 --> 35:21.974
<i>You murdered my son!
I did not kill anyone.!</i>

35:22.053 --> 35:24.715
Why would I kill Pervis? I
loved him. He believed you.

35:24.789 --> 35:28.555
- He listened to you better than he did
me or his mama. - She put a spell on him-

35:28.626 --> 35:31.356
like some New Orleans voodoo witch.

35:34.899 --> 35:38.164
This can't be happening.
This is a bad dream.

35:38.236 --> 35:41.501
Gooshie, center me back on Sam.
I'll be right back.

35:41.572 --> 35:43.506
<i>Sam.! Come on.!</i>

35:43.574 --> 35:47.237
Get up! We're running out of time.
Sam? Sam! You can hear me!

35:47.311 --> 35:49.802
<i>Damn it, I know you can hear me.!
Come on.!</i>

35:51.215 --> 35:53.149
<i>That's it.!</i>

35:53.217 --> 35:55.879
That's it! You can do it!
Come on, kid. You can do it!

35:55.953 --> 35:59.150
- Abigail.
- Yes! They got Abigail, and they're gonna hang her!

35:59.223 --> 36:02.056
They're gonna hang her in
nine minutes and 15.3 seconds.

36:02.126 --> 36:04.060
You gotta get to
the center of town-

36:04.128 --> 36:07.689
And talk some sense into
these people. Leta Aider.

36:07.765 --> 36:10.131
Yeah. She convinced them
that Abigail killed that little kid.

36:10.201 --> 36:12.226
Now everyone's gone nuts.
How many, Al?

36:12.303 --> 36:16.569
Oh, there's 20 to 30 of'em, mostly women, and
they're screaming like it was the Inquisition.

36:16.641 --> 36:19.269
Did Ziggy locate Pervis? No. But when
they find that kid in the morning,

36:19.343 --> 36:22.210
I wonder what those townspeople
are gonna think of themselves.

36:24.282 --> 36:29.720
- Sam, you're not stuttering.
- As soon as I touched Abigail, Al, it was me.

36:31.122 --> 36:36.719
<i>There was nothing left of Will-
Just... me and Abigail.</i>

36:36.794 --> 36:40.059
There's not gonna be anything left of her
if you don't get over there. Now hurry up!

36:40.131 --> 36:43.532
Where are they? The center of town. They're
gonna hang her from that great big tree.

36:43.601 --> 36:46.126
Al-
You got eight minutes.

36:46.204 --> 36:50.004
Al, go to her, okay?

36:50.074 --> 36:52.736
I don't want her to be all alone.
Okay, I will. Go!

36:52.810 --> 36:54.778
Go! Go! Will ya?

36:58.382 --> 37:03.081
<i>- Sam is on the way!
- Bo, Ben, Sarah.! You've known me all my life.</i>

37:03.154 --> 37:05.748
They know you're
a cold-blooded child killer!

37:05.823 --> 37:09.156
We have to put a stop
to the murder of our children.

37:20.104 --> 37:24.507
- Hey! What the hell is goin' on here?
- Mr. Stanton. Please, help me!

37:24.575 --> 37:27.169
Stay out of it, Stanton.
You people lost your mind?

37:27.245 --> 37:29.907
- Let this girl go!
- Good. There's someone here with a brain working.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.040
<i>She killed my son.
Yeah.</i>

37:32.116 --> 37:36.348
Your son is lost. Sheriff Loman and the rest
of the town out looking for him now.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.445
Yeah. That's what the rest
of you idiots should be doing!

37:38.522 --> 37:43.016
I suggest the rest of you people
either come out and help us or go home!

37:43.094 --> 37:45.187
'Cause this isn't
gonna help us find the boy.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.960
- They're not gonna find him because she murdered him.
- I did not!

37:49.033 --> 37:52.833
Murdered him and hid the body, just like she
did to my Violet. Now, you don't know that.

37:52.903 --> 37:57.067
- Listen to him. He's right!
- Now shut up. Stop it!

37:57.141 --> 37:59.632
Stop it, all of you!
Just stop it!

37:59.710 --> 38:01.837
I want you to hand
Abigail over to me,

38:01.912 --> 38:06.611
or so help me, I'll file attempted murder
charges against each and every one of you.

38:06.684 --> 38:10.620
<i>Can he do that?</i>

38:10.688 --> 38:14.021
Cody, give me a hand here.
Abigail-

38:14.091 --> 38:17.652
- Oh!
- No one's gonna save you now, you witch!

38:17.728 --> 38:21.289
Let's do it!
Let's hang this evil woman!

38:22.500 --> 38:26.994
<i>No.! Will.! Will.! Will.!</i>

38:31.742 --> 38:35.178
- Sam!
- Let me go! I'm innocent!

38:47.558 --> 38:49.924
<i>- Will!
- Kill this murderer.!</i>

39:05.109 --> 39:07.202
<i>Watch out, Sam, behind you.!</i>

39:11.349 --> 39:14.079
- Let her go, Will. Get out of the way.
- I can't.

39:14.151 --> 39:16.881
- You got no choice.
- The hell he doesn't.

39:16.954 --> 39:21.755
I've got the same choice you do
- to commit a murder or not. And I'm not about to let you take the life of an innocent woman.

39:21.826 --> 39:25.853
- She's a murderer!
- Prove it!

39:25.930 --> 39:29.058
- Let the courts prove it.
- That woman is a cold-blooded killer.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.033
She's not a killer and neither are you.

39:31.102 --> 39:33.161
<i>She killed my son.
I say your son's alive.</i>

39:33.237 --> 39:36.365
- He's alive!
- If you hang her and he turns up...

39:36.440 --> 39:39.603
how are you gonna live with her murder
on your head for the rest of your life?

39:39.677 --> 39:42.237
You people aren't murderers.

39:42.313 --> 39:46.044
You're good, decent people
with families and children.

39:46.117 --> 39:49.052
<i>Children that she kills.</i>

39:49.120 --> 39:52.089
Listen to me!
Listen to me!

39:52.156 --> 39:56.149
Now, if she's right
and Pervis is dead,

39:56.227 --> 40:00.960
then we'll turn Abigail over to the
state sheriff's office tomorrow for trial.

40:01.031 --> 40:02.965
- What about justice?
- That is justice.

40:03.033 --> 40:07.561
<i>Justice? Like thejustice her daddy held over
my Violet when he closed the files on her?</i>

40:07.638 --> 40:12.940
Only this time, when they don't find that little
boy's body, it won't be her daddy who closes the case.

40:13.010 --> 40:16.776
But it'll be her husband.

40:16.847 --> 40:19.645
Tell 'em to give you five hours.

40:19.717 --> 40:23.175
Listen to me! Give me five hours.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.779
Five hours.

40:25.856 --> 40:27.847
If we haven't found Pervis,

40:29.860 --> 40:32.624
then I'll turn her over to you.
No, Will!

40:32.696 --> 40:35.062
<i>No. Oh, Sam, no.!
Will, in God's name, no! Will!</i>

40:35.132 --> 40:37.965
Listen to me. You've got to
trust me. You've got to trust me!

40:38.035 --> 40:39.627
Kill her! Kill her!
Yeah!

40:41.105 --> 40:43.835
No!

40:43.908 --> 40:47.309
- We won't kill her.
- She killed your son!

40:47.378 --> 40:50.108
- She killed him like she killed my Violet.
- Your boy's not dead.

40:50.181 --> 40:54.311
He's lying.
You have got to kill her.

40:54.385 --> 40:57.149
He's my little boy!
And I don't want her murder on my head.

40:57.221 --> 41:00.884
- You know where my boy is?
- Uh, Sam, Ziggy's trying to get...

41:00.958 --> 41:02.892
a perimeter lock on where
Pervis was found.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.053
<i>Uh
- And ifhe's anywhere near the location,</i>

41:05.129 --> 41:07.791
- maybe she can get a heat lock.
- I'm askin' you where my boy is.

41:07.865 --> 41:10.333
<i>Got it.! Got it.! Send someone
to the mill off of Plantation Road.</i>

41:10.401 --> 41:12.528
<i>Send somebody to the mill off
Plantation Road. He's there now.</i>

41:12.603 --> 41:15.538
He's there right now. Go now!
It's a trick!

41:15.606 --> 41:17.733
Can't you tell that's a trick?

41:19.477 --> 41:22.913
How do you know my boy's there?
If he's there, does it matter?

41:25.449 --> 41:29.249
We'll wait right here
until you get back.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.483
She'll be right here.
Go look, Donny.

41:32.556 --> 41:34.820
Please?

41:36.694 --> 41:38.685
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

41:38.762 --> 41:42.357
You take this. I'll be right back.

41:46.804 --> 41:48.533
No! No!

41:48.606 --> 41:50.437
Sam! Look out!

41:51.308 --> 41:54.038
No! No! No!
She should die! No!

41:59.783 --> 42:02.115
You all right?
You okay? Yeah.

42:02.186 --> 42:04.245
Oh, Will.
They won't hurt you.

42:04.321 --> 42:07.085
I promise, they won't hurt you.
I love you.

42:07.157 --> 42:11.617
No! She killed my boy.
She should die.

42:14.298 --> 42:18.359
It's over.

42:21.372 --> 42:25.206
I don't have a lot of time.
What are you talking about?

42:28.412 --> 42:31.142
I love you.

42:32.583 --> 42:35.347
And no matter what happens...

42:35.419 --> 42:37.717
or whatever I say in the future,

42:37.788 --> 42:41.656
just know that for right now,

42:41.725 --> 42:45.456
for this... brief moment in time,

42:47.498 --> 42:49.728
we belonged to each other.

42:50.734 --> 42:54.431
Please know that.

42:54.505 --> 42:56.598
I love you.

43:21.932 --> 43:25.959
<i>My memory was fading,
but in my soul, I knew it wasn't over.</i>

43:26.036 --> 43:30.496
<i>I was still in the South, and somehow
Abigail had summoned me back.</i>

43:30.574 --> 43:34.010
<i>But for what? And as who?</i>

Hello, sweet cheeks.
