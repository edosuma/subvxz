00:02.560 --> 00:04.480
NARRATOR: Previously
on "Dance Academy--"

00:04.519 --> 00:05.639
-I am a choreographer.

00:05.679 --> 00:07.280
I am looking for dancers.

00:07.320 --> 00:09.320
Come and work as my assistant.

00:09.359 --> 00:11.759
See if you can cut it in a
professional environment.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.599
-Guys, how you doing?

00:13.640 --> 00:14.359
I'm Myles.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.039
SAMMY: Myles.

00:15.080 --> 00:15.800
-It was brilliant.

00:15.839 --> 00:16.640
-You know, she's right.

00:16.679 --> 00:18.160
You were brilliant.

00:18.199 --> 00:19.199
-You felt the need to push
the boundaries this year.

00:19.239 --> 00:20.719
-I've been pushing
the boundaries

00:20.760 --> 00:22.640
because I've been
unhappy here, Dad.

00:22.679 --> 00:23.760
-You have to talk to them.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.079
-No, I have to rehearse.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.679
If they're splitting
up because of me,

00:27.719 --> 00:29.679
I may as well make
it worthwhile.

00:29.719 --> 00:31.239
Mom?

00:31.280 --> 00:32.600
Paige and I really need to
talk to you about something.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.320
NARRATOR: Christian's never
gonna speak to me again.

00:34.359 --> 00:36.159
-Sammy, a man crush isn't
the end of the world.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.280
-What if it's more than that?

00:37.320 --> 00:39.240
-This has to stay in the vault.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.320
You're dancing Clara.

00:55.079 --> 00:58.520
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.399
Close your eyes.

01:01.439 --> 01:05.480
Take a leap of faith
and lead the way

01:05.519 --> 01:09.480
tonight, tonight, tonight.

01:09.519 --> 01:11.799
This is my chance.

01:11.840 --> 01:16.799
This is my chance, my
chance to feel alive.

01:16.840 --> 01:20.120
Whoa-oh, whoa, whoa-oh.

01:28.319 --> 01:30.280
-"The Nutcracker"
is Clara's story.

01:30.319 --> 01:34.159
And it's more than
just a dancing run.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.719
You must take the
audience on her adventure.

01:37.760 --> 01:41.719
Transport them
into another world.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.159
TARA (VOICEOVER):
Growing up on the farm,

01:46.200 --> 01:49.439
I didn't see the ocean
until I was eight.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.519
As soon as we pulled up to the
beach, I was out of the car

01:52.560 --> 01:54.400
and into the waves.

01:54.439 --> 01:56.599
I thought I knew
everything and didn't

01:56.640 --> 01:59.599
stop to listen to any warnings.

01:59.640 --> 02:03.200
MISS RAINE: Act Two, Snowflakes
and Land of Sweets, Studio Two.

02:03.239 --> 02:06.640
Boys, battle
scenes, Studio Five.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.120
-Dude, we're going
to be out there

02:08.158 --> 02:09.400
every day of the holidays.

02:09.439 --> 02:11.240
-Sweet.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.120
-Christian's gonna teach
me how to surf, so.

02:13.159 --> 02:15.120
-Oh, rock on.

02:15.159 --> 02:17.039
-Katrina.

02:17.080 --> 02:17.639
Katrina!

02:17.680 --> 02:18.520
See me later.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.159
I have plans for you.

02:20.199 --> 02:22.039
TARA (VOICEOVER): It
took about three minutes

02:22.080 --> 02:24.599
for the rip to
drag me out to sea.

02:24.639 --> 02:28.680
I was in way over my head,
and I didn't even know it.

02:28.719 --> 02:29.719
-Good start, Tara.

02:29.759 --> 02:31.039
Good start.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.639
Keep warm until the
others get here.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.319
Abigail.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.240
You'll be understudying Clara.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.080
You should be very
proud of your audition.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.599
It was technically
very competent.

02:45.639 --> 02:46.400
-Thank you.

02:46.439 --> 02:48.199
-No, thank you.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.319
-Who are you understudying?

02:56.360 --> 02:56.800
-No one.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.120
-Oh, sorry.

02:59.159 --> 03:01.560
Just assumed they might
have given you something.

03:01.599 --> 03:02.639
-I got Clara.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.479
-Well done.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.479
-Oh, Ethan, nice
of you to join us.

03:06.520 --> 03:10.120
My assistants usually
arrive before the dancers.

03:10.159 --> 03:12.199
OK, starting with the
Act Two Snowflakes.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.479
Clara, to the center, please.

03:17.599 --> 03:19.120
GIRL: Tara Webster?

03:19.159 --> 03:20.560
She's only a first year.

03:23.560 --> 03:24.599
-Congratulations.

03:24.639 --> 03:27.159
But don't hold back
on the grand jete.

03:27.199 --> 03:30.479
-Ethan, could I have your
expertise over here, please?

03:30.520 --> 03:31.759
Macchiato, double shot.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.120
Easy on the foam.

03:34.159 --> 03:37.520
Snowflakes, first
position, thank you.

03:37.560 --> 03:38.680
-Soldiers attack.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.719
OK, with music.

03:44.759 --> 03:46.199
Bring some energy to it, guys.

03:48.879 --> 03:50.560
Nice and sharp.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.120
Good.

03:56.159 --> 03:58.599
Keep going.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.400
Nice, clean hits here, guys.

04:01.439 --> 04:01.719
Clean.

04:07.439 --> 04:09.199
OK, sharp turns.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.520
Finish.

04:11.560 --> 04:14.199
Remember, this is just
the illusion of fighting.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.639
You actually need
to work together.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.800
OK.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.600
First positions.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.399
This time, work as a team.

04:32.240 --> 04:36.800
-Each of these tutus needs
to be washed and sequined.

04:36.839 --> 04:39.800
-Oh, always happy to
help you guys out.

04:39.839 --> 04:42.040
I was thinking next
production that, uh,

04:42.079 --> 04:43.759
I might try set design.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.800
-Productions for
students of the Academy.

04:45.839 --> 04:48.160
I doubt you'll be
here for the next one.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.720
-One rehearsal, and I
already feel like I'm--

04:53.759 --> 04:55.160
-Drowning.

04:55.199 --> 04:57.600
-There's just so much
to get my head around.

04:57.639 --> 04:58.360
-Mm.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.399
-Sammy, wait up!

05:02.519 --> 05:04.480
Hey, how's life
in the spotlight?

05:04.519 --> 05:07.120
-I haven't made a total
fool of myself yet. [laugh]

05:07.160 --> 05:08.600
-It's only lunch.

05:08.639 --> 05:09.399
-Thanks.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.199
See you, guys.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.839
-Hey, uh, my parole officer
said that your parents

05:14.879 --> 05:17.639
need to sign these in order for
me to stay over the holidays.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.600
-Oh, my dad.

05:22.639 --> 05:25.399
-Do you think he'll be cool?

05:25.439 --> 05:27.079
-Cool and Dr.
Lieberman don't really

05:27.120 --> 05:28.199
fit in the same sentence.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.399
But yeah, I'm sure he'll sign.

05:31.439 --> 05:32.879
-Cool.

05:32.920 --> 05:38.560
-So I'm sewing about a million
sequins by hand onto tutus.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.600
And I have no idea what I
want to do it with my life.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.680
-For the first time
in my life, I finally

05:48.720 --> 05:56.439
get a mate, who's a guy friend,
who I can hang out with.

05:56.480 --> 06:01.199
And then I-- I get--
I get these-- [sigh]

06:01.240 --> 06:05.079
-Struggling for
clarity right now.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.839
-I'm trying to say feelings,
but it's too weird.

06:08.879 --> 06:09.600
-Right.

06:09.639 --> 06:10.639
Ugly word.

06:10.680 --> 06:14.439
Let's call them muffins.

06:14.480 --> 06:18.399
And I'm glad we're finally
talking about this.

06:18.439 --> 06:22.519
-OK, so you know how I get
these muffins when I'm around--

06:22.560 --> 06:24.519
-Christian.

06:24.560 --> 06:28.680
Let's call him Mouse Ears.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.639
-Right, Mouse Ears.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.639
You know, before I started
getting these muffins,

06:33.680 --> 06:35.279
I thought I knew
exactly who I was.

06:35.319 --> 06:39.120
And now I can't stop thinking
it means that I'm a-- what?

06:39.160 --> 06:40.360
-A Labrador.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.319
-What?

06:41.360 --> 06:43.800
-Friendly, cuddly,
bouncy Labrador.

06:43.839 --> 06:45.240
-You're right.
(SARCASTICALLY) I'm

06:45.279 --> 06:47.120
so glad we're talking to this.

06:47.160 --> 06:47.600
-No, no, no.

06:47.639 --> 06:49.199
Com on.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.800
I just think you need to focus
on your muffins for Mouse Ears.

06:51.839 --> 06:53.160
OK?

06:53.199 --> 06:54.439
Don't agonize over
the Labrador thing

06:54.480 --> 06:56.399
until it follows you home
and asks you to keep it.

06:56.439 --> 06:57.199
-Yeah?

06:57.240 --> 06:58.519
Well, I have a better plan.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.639
Avoid Mouse Ears
until the muffins go.

07:01.680 --> 07:04.480
Every last crumb.

07:04.519 --> 07:06.120
[sigh]

07:13.680 --> 07:15.600
-Homework?

07:15.639 --> 07:17.040
-Sort of.

07:17.079 --> 07:18.480
Don't.

07:18.519 --> 07:20.720
-Pros and cons.

07:20.759 --> 07:24.360
Should I tell ME
about the muffins?

07:24.399 --> 07:24.800
Who's ME?

07:24.839 --> 07:26.519
-No one.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.560
Cons.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.439
One, probably hates Labrador.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.800
Two, I'll be thrown into
the harbor, or I'll jump.

07:32.839 --> 07:35.279
Three, Jews can't
join a monastery.

07:37.759 --> 07:39.800
-Should I ask?

07:39.839 --> 07:40.639
-Please don't.

07:43.319 --> 07:47.399
-Hey, what you did your dad say
when you gave him the forms?

07:47.439 --> 07:50.160
-Um, he-- he hasn't
signed them yet.

07:50.199 --> 07:51.800
He's been quite busy with work.

07:51.839 --> 07:55.199
But I'm on it, so yeah.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.120
-And you should
probably tell ME.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.519
She might like muffins.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.800
-I doubt it.

08:04.839 --> 08:06.639
-I call and call, and
you never pick up.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.480
I've had rehearsals.

08:08.519 --> 08:12.079
I'm understudying Clara, and
I got the Snowflake solo.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.199
-That's great, Abigail.

08:16.399 --> 08:17.399
Your mom rang.

08:17.439 --> 08:19.399
She told me what's
happening at home.

08:23.639 --> 08:26.600
Having your parents separate
is a pretty tough thing

08:26.639 --> 08:28.680
for anyone.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.319
-Look, Adam, I'm not sitting
on the couch right now.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.399
And this has nothing
to do with eating.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.080
So I don't really see how this
fits your job description.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.320
-Sometimes when students see
their parents making sacrifices

08:41.360 --> 08:42.759
for them to attend
the Academy, they

08:42.799 --> 08:45.399
can blame themselves when thing
start to go wrong at home.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.639
-Look, can we skip
the psychobabble?

08:48.679 --> 08:50.279
Mom left Dad behind
in Brisbane so

08:50.320 --> 08:52.120
that she could
support my dancing.

08:52.159 --> 08:54.080
Now they're separating
because of the distance.

08:54.120 --> 08:58.679
It all seems pretty
cause-and-effect to me.

08:58.720 --> 08:59.799
We done?

08:59.840 --> 09:01.159
I've got rehearsals.

09:05.440 --> 09:11.320
[phone ringing]

09:11.360 --> 09:12.159
-Save me.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.440
I am drowning in a sea of tulle.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.200
MYLES (ON PHONE): Oh.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.799
Well hello, gorgeous.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.480
How's the weather down there?

09:17.519 --> 09:18.480
-Myles.

09:18.519 --> 09:21.639
Hi, um, better than
London, I guess.

09:21.679 --> 09:22.639
But I wouldn't know.

09:22.679 --> 09:24.240
I haven't been outside all day.

09:24.279 --> 09:26.600
MYLES (ON PHONE): Well, go
outside and check it for me.

09:26.639 --> 09:27.799
-Sure.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.799
If you want to spend
an international phone

09:29.840 --> 09:31.440
call talking about the weather.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.600
And hey, then we can
discuss phone connection.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.120
I have to go.

09:38.159 --> 09:39.039
There's someone at the door.

09:39.080 --> 09:39.720
-Oh, should I be jealous?

09:39.759 --> 09:40.480
-I don't know.

09:40.519 --> 09:41.519
He's pretty hot.

09:45.519 --> 09:49.559
ETHAN: OK, remember
what we said?

09:49.600 --> 09:50.519
Maintain your focus.

09:50.559 --> 09:51.759
Maintain your spot.

09:51.799 --> 09:54.159
And--

09:54.200 --> 09:56.159
-You're expecting
too much of me.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.559
Clara's on stage the whole time.

09:57.600 --> 09:58.639
I'm not ready.

09:58.679 --> 09:59.799
SEBASTIAN: You
wouldn't have been

09:59.840 --> 10:01.639
cast if you weren't ready, Tara.

10:01.679 --> 10:03.759
You've had a long day.

10:03.799 --> 10:06.600
Rest up for tomorrow.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.279
Can I steal you for
a moment, Ethan?

10:15.159 --> 10:17.720
Assistant choreographer is
such a difficult concept

10:17.759 --> 10:19.279
to wrap your head around.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.120
-Well, Tara was uncertain
about some of the choreography.

10:22.159 --> 10:25.039
I have an extremely experienced
dancer in one my lead roles,

10:25.080 --> 10:27.159
and you decide to give
her unsupervised advice.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.120
-I thought it would
save time in rehearsals.

10:29.159 --> 10:31.039
-You argued for Tara
in the audition,

10:31.080 --> 10:33.720
and I saw enough potential
to give her a chance.

10:33.759 --> 10:36.240
But she's struggling.

10:36.279 --> 10:38.759
You need to remain professional.

10:38.799 --> 10:40.440
Is that understood?

10:40.480 --> 10:41.440
-Yes, sir.

10:46.639 --> 10:51.399
-OK, the path to happiness
begins with a dream.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.279
-That's my problem.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.480
I don't remember my dreams.

10:54.519 --> 10:55.120
-I do.

10:55.159 --> 10:55.759
-Let's hear it.

10:55.799 --> 10:56.559
-OK.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.320
-All right, go.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.679
-Fly to Darwin.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.360
Hire a Kombi.

11:00.399 --> 11:01.559
Drive around all--

11:01.600 --> 11:02.279
-Drive?

11:02.320 --> 11:03.759
You're 16.

11:03.799 --> 11:05.080
-It's a dream, OK?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.279
Just go with it.
[clears throat] OK,

11:06.320 --> 11:07.559
so I drive around the
whole of Australia,

11:07.600 --> 11:10.120
stopping at every single
beach and camping out

11:10.159 --> 11:11.759
at every single music festival.

11:11.799 --> 11:13.399
-It's nice.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.919
-OK, what's yours say?

11:14.960 --> 11:19.279
--[laugh] What's the difference
between Myles Kelly and bubble

gum?

11:21.240 --> 11:23.080
One's artificially
flavored disposable pop,

11:23.120 --> 11:27.000
and the other's just bubble gum.

11:27.039 --> 11:29.200
-It's a bit cynical, isn't it?

11:29.240 --> 11:33.519
-Everyone I respect
thinks I'm a puppet, just

11:33.559 --> 11:36.440
another manufactured pop star.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.799
And they're right.

11:39.840 --> 11:43.559
-OK, so cut the strings.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.600
Write something that's for you.

11:47.639 --> 11:49.600

to jump on Christian.

12:26.399 --> 12:29.759
-Yeah, I-- I thought it'd be,
uh, more dramatic if, like,

12:29.799 --> 12:31.360
we created--

12:31.399 --> 12:33.360
-Yeah, let's just stay with the

-Yep.

Yep.

You still have the

13:13.720 --> 13:15.440
We don't have time for this.

13:15.480 --> 13:16.720
What's the problem?

13:16.759 --> 13:19.759
-Um, I-- I think I
just lost my focus.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.360
We have to move on.

Get the DVD and make sure you
know it by next rehearsal.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.039
I missed my cue.

I can't do the steps.

13:46.799 --> 13:50.000
Ethan, help me!

13:50.039 --> 13:51.759
-You should've gotten Clara.

13:51.799 --> 13:53.240

13:53.279 --> 13:54.320
Or Suni.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.639
We all know why she got it.

13:55.679 --> 13:57.759
It helps when the assistant

you're not afraid to-- Sorry.

But this is a
professional production.

And thanks to one
person, it's going

14:09.480 --> 14:12.519

Christmas concert.

14:12.559 --> 14:17.639
-Abigail, you were well
cast as a Snowflake.

14:17.679 --> 14:18.759
But Clara's about heart.

that Tara plays that role.

Because if it's you
up there, the audience

14:26.200 --> 14:28.480
will see how empty
you really are.

They shouldn't have to look
after a convicted criminal.

I'm really sorry.

15:30.559 --> 15:32.000

15:32.039 --> 15:33.120
-You're lucky.

-I let Mouse Ears think my
dad didn't sign the forms,

because my muffins
are out of control,

means I'm a Labrador.

15:49.679 --> 15:51.240
-OK, that is low.

15:51.279 --> 15:53.440
You're making Christian
believe that he's not good

enough for your family.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.360
-I just-- I need some space, OK?

15:57.399 --> 16:00.200
I just need some
time away from him

16:00.240 --> 16:01.799
to get my head back to normal.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.559
-So you're gonna let your best
mate rot in the boarding house

16:04.600 --> 16:07.000

talk about your feelings?

-What do you want me to do, Kat?

16:08.679 --> 16:12.200
Should I get a t-shit that says
"Samuel Lieberman-- gay boy.

Have you seen my roommate?"

16:16.120 --> 16:17.480
-You said the G word.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.559
-Well, I can't pretend it's
just a man crush anymore.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.120
-I think it's a little bit
too early to be worrying about

whether you are or you aren't.

What you do need
to worry about it

16:28.200 --> 16:30.600
He has done nothing
wrong, and you

16:30.639 --> 16:32.399
can't make him
think that he has.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.039
-Hey.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.519
-Do you think I'm empty?

17:17.759 --> 17:19.118
-Never.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.799
-Then why'd you
break up with me?

17:21.839 --> 17:22.640
I'm fine with it.

17:22.680 --> 17:23.440
I'm just curious.

just stopped feeling right.

that I'm a Labrador.

ask your folks first,
