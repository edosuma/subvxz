00:02.880 --> 00:04.916
David, I'm leaving you.
- Ah!

00:05.000 --> 00:07.878
What's that?
- My sun hat. My old school sun hat.

00:07.960 --> 00:09.871
What were you saying?
- Um...

00:09.960 --> 00:13.396
I was saying I'm leaving you
to sort out the cameras and stuff.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.357
All in hand.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.869
<i>Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Adam!</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.190
The doctor's not worried, so why are you?

00:22.280 --> 00:24.157
Because I'll have to carry all the bags.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.915
And you're always on the loo.
On a jumbo jet that could cause a riot.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.359
Well, now where are you going?
- Where do you think?

00:35.400 --> 00:37.356
Where's Rachel?
- Loo.

01:05.040 --> 01:08.077
Here's to what I hope will be
the holiday of a lifetime.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.558
Trust me,
you definitely want her to sit in the aisle.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.998
David, I really think one of us
should swap with Rach.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.116
Why?
- Because she's pregnant.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.236
You know what economy class is like.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.156
I vaguely remember.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.876
Well, if you want.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.797
<i>One thing you get in economy,
you don't get in business class.</i>

01:39.880 --> 01:42.030
What's that?
- Deep vein thrombosis.

01:42.760 --> 01:43.829
Great.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.916
Oh. Here they come.
- Woo-hoo!

02:09.919 --> 02:11.876
Hey-hey!

02:12.640 --> 02:14.517
To think I worried you'd go native.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.397
Ha-ha-ha!

02:16.480 --> 02:18.755
All right, mate?
- G'day, mate. Ripper!

02:18.840 --> 02:20.717
<i>Hi, Pete.</i>

02:27.680 --> 02:29.557
So, who wants to see the sights?

02:29.640 --> 02:31.596
I'd rather see the hotel.

02:31.680 --> 02:34.433
You didn't sleep in business class?
- And waste it?

02:34.520 --> 02:38.035
Karen, darling.
The office have sent a limo to collect us.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.554
Unless Rach would like it.

02:40.640 --> 02:44.838
Er...David, where's your luggage?
- Our driver's taken it.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.918
You're joking.
You've not fallen for that one, have you?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.513
What? He had our name.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.875
Oh, he'll be halfway to Queensland by now.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.872
You!
- Ha-ha! Gets 'em every time.

03:06.480 --> 03:07.674
Right.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.638
Well, the last time I came to Sydney,
I said to myself,

03:10.720 --> 03:15.236
''The next time I come, I'm bringing Karen.
And we are staying here.''

03:15.320 --> 03:17.880
Why, is it really nice?
- Close your eyes.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.951
Ohh!
- OK, I'll steer.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.792
Straight down.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.916
David, slowly.
- Just turn a corner.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.036
Keep your eyes closed.
- Ohh!

03:27.400 --> 03:29.231
And...open them.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.953
So, what do you think?
- I think it's really nice.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.712
Yeah, it's lovely.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.510
Oh, my God.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.475
Oh, my God!

03:46.560 --> 03:48.790
David, that is amazing.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.836
It's not bad, is it?

03:51.560 --> 03:53.516
Let's go on the balcony.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.717
You know the last time
we went away without the children?

04:04.800 --> 04:06.119
Paris.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.033
I gave you that necklace.
- And I lost it.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.395
I'm very sorry it has taken so long...
to replace it.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.749
You know what insurance companies are like.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.035
I thought you might like to wear it tonight.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.115
Madame Butterfly at the opera house.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.236
If you'd like to go?

04:28.960 --> 04:30.791
My favourite opera.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.312
What a coincidence.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.389
Jo and Pete seem happy.
- Yeah, well, you would hope so.

04:42.480 --> 04:45.790
You could try and be happy for them.
- Yeah, yeah, I could...

04:45.880 --> 04:48.348
What time did they say they'd pick us up?
- Three.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.271
Great. Two hours' kip.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.476
Do you fancy a... Oh, no.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.836
I thought you put the Do Not Disturb
sign out. - I did, I did.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.994
<i>Housekeeping? Towels.</i>

04:59.800 --> 05:03.270
Erm...shall I give her a tip?
- Yeah, tell her to learn to read.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.676
Adam, right?
- Yeah.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.557
Lucy?
- Rachel!

05:14.640 --> 05:16.596
Lucy!
- Oh, my God!

05:16.680 --> 05:19.114
Oh, my God!

05:19.200 --> 05:21.156
Hello!
- Look at you!

05:21.240 --> 05:22.958
<i>Rachel's sister.</i>

05:23.040 --> 05:25.349
Her lesbian sister.
- Not to label her in any way.

05:25.440 --> 05:28.671
It's something to take into account.
- Especially when kissing her.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.035
This is Lucy.
- Hi.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.716
Hello, Lucy.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.472
If she said she had an orgasm,
you know she was faking it.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.596
Oh, it's so great to see you.

05:47.320 --> 05:50.995
I've been so excited all week,
especially since the plane landed.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.676
Still, I guess you're the same, eh?

05:54.680 --> 05:55.829
Oh.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.716
Come on in.
- Et voila!

06:06.400 --> 06:07.799
<i>Wow!</i>

06:07.880 --> 06:10.314
So, Jo, erm...your father's a builder?
- Yeah.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.277
Yeah, like Mr Barratt's a builder.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.828
He's in Brisbane,
working on some new development.

06:14.920 --> 06:18.435
This is one of his houses. - Christ, I bet
this isn't like most he builds.

06:18.520 --> 06:21.353
<i>Well, I don't know. The bathroom
window leaks.</i>

06:22.080 --> 06:24.878
Why don't you go out to the pool?
I'll get us some drinks.

06:24.960 --> 06:29.238
Oh, I didn't bring my swimming cossie.
- Doesn't matter. We don't wear them.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.276
Oh. Local boy done good, eh?

06:32.640 --> 06:34.596
Holy Jesus, look at that!

06:35.360 --> 06:37.316
<i>Whoa!</i>

06:37.400 --> 06:39.356
Whoo-hoo!

06:41.360 --> 06:43.669
Come on, David, get your shorts off.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.029
No, no, no, Karen!

06:51.120 --> 06:54.795
Oh, my God! What's that? - Another good
reason for keeping my shorts on.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.508
Ah, you bollocks!
- I'll get it.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.033
Go on, hurry up.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.076
<i>Will you leave him alone?</i>

07:06.120 --> 07:09.829
Mine's shrunk to the size of a peanut!
It's the sight of Pete's arse.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.438
Look at that. Oh, my Go...

07:18.920 --> 07:20.717
G'day.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.791
I must be in the wrong place.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.792
Because my swimming pool
doesn't have four naked people in it.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.711
Actually, I'm not naked.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.959
You must be Jo's father.
David Marsden. Pleased to meet you.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.595
Obviously very pleased to meet me, David.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.276
Dad. What are you doing here?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.355
Apart from feeling incredibly overdressed...

07:56.440 --> 08:00.274
Who are these people, Joanne?
- Er, Pete, Adam, Karen...

08:00.360 --> 08:03.352
And...David.
- They've come over from England.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.238
For the wedding.
- Oh, that's nice.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.436
What wedding?

08:12.800 --> 08:15.872
She didn't tell her father.
Don't you think that's odd?

08:15.960 --> 08:17.916
You said he'd been away on business.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.470
Yeah, but they have phones
in Australia, in the cities anyway.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.596
I didn't want to tell him over the phone.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.148
News like that, you don't keep
it to yourself.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.591
I phoned my mother immediately.
- In the middle of the night!

08:49.680 --> 08:52.114
She thought someone had died.
- Yeah, well...

08:52.200 --> 08:56.273
My dad's somebody you handle with care,
or there's no telling what he'll do.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.032
So how did he react?

08:58.760 --> 09:01.115
All things considered, I'd say pretty well.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.838
Congratulations.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.633
Thanks.

09:07.720 --> 09:10.871
It could have been a lot worse.
- What makes you say that?

09:24.760 --> 09:26.830
Well, he might have thrown me out.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.797
As it was, he barely reacted.

09:28.880 --> 09:32.350
Oh, don't you worry, he will.
When the time suits him.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.516
Jo!
- Shawn.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.872
Come in.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.592
What are you doing here?
- I'm er...working with Rod.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.636
I've got some drawings for him.

09:56.720 --> 10:00.269
I didn't know you were back.
- Yeah, well, just...briefly.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.829
Er...is he...is he in?
- Oh, God, yeah. He's just through here.

10:12.520 --> 10:16.229
Oh, Shawn. Got those plans for me.
- Yeah, only a couple of days late.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.833
I heard the surf's been pretty good lately.
- Yeah.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.996
This is Pete.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.718
Hi.
- G'day. How are you?

10:26.800 --> 10:28.472
Him and Jo are getting married.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.039
Married?

10:33.120 --> 10:34.838
So I've been informed.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.876
Well, congratulations.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.796
You must be quite a special bloke.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.233
No.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.875
So, er...when's the happy day?

10:47.960 --> 10:51.157
Next week.
- We'll have to get together before then.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.754
Why don't you guys come out to the house?

10:53.840 --> 10:55.796
Oh, that'd be great. Thanks.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.596
Shawn, want a beer?
- Yeah, ta.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.475
Seems like a nice bloke.
- Yeah.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.636
Ex, is he?

11:14.840 --> 11:16.796
Don't miss a trick, love.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.198
Cheers.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.556
Ah-ha! How are you?

11:27.560 --> 11:29.232
See you soon.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.072
Hi.
- Looking good.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.519
It's nice of you to throw a barbie for us,
Shawn. - Any excuse, you know?

11:40.840 --> 11:42.717
Man!

11:42.800 --> 11:44.711
Wonderful place you have here.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.633
Australia? God's own country, mate.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.757
I was actually being more specific
than that... mate.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.953
Don't you want to meet your friends?
- No, I do not. I want all the goss.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.032
Erm... Well...

12:00.120 --> 12:02.076
Mum and Dad came to stay.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.116
Yeah, I know about that.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.031
Mum told me about that.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.430
Are you still not talking to Dad?
- No, I'm not.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.873
How was it? Now that he knows about you?

12:14.960 --> 12:18.475
I'm sorry.
- It's fine. It was OK.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.313
What, you mean you actually talked about it?

12:21.400 --> 12:23.356
Well...no.

12:23.440 --> 12:27.592
And I didn't wear my Dyke Power T-shirt,
but Mum says he's cool.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.398
Our Dad, cool?

12:29.480 --> 12:33.792
Well, I think as long as he doesn't see me with
my tongue down some woman's throat, he's fine.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.677
He can just pretend I'm normal.

12:35.760 --> 12:39.230
And that's all right for you, is it?
He's still a bloody bigot.

12:39.320 --> 12:44.110
Rachel, I don't want to change the world,
I just want to get on with my dad.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.228
<i>I think
I might borrow one of Shawn's long boards</i>

12:49.320 --> 12:51.880
<i>and get out there and have a bit of
a surf myself.</i>

12:51.960 --> 12:53.632
Hiya.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.233
Adam.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.038
Mate of Pete's.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.476
We met at your house.
- Oh, yeah, sorry. Excuse me.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.834
I didn't recognise you with your clothes on.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.516
Can I see you for a minute?

13:11.080 --> 13:13.150
What's he like, my future son-in-law?

13:14.240 --> 13:16.595
Pete? Salt of the earth, great bloke.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.636
I'd trust him with my life.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.393
You've known him a while, then.
- About a month.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.398
Joke.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.156
What do you make of this wedding?

13:29.360 --> 13:32.796
Erm...great, you know.
Terrific. They make a lovely couple.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.840
You don't think it's a bit...sudden?

13:39.600 --> 13:41.272
Well...

13:41.360 --> 13:44.238
I mean, who knows what makes
a successful marriage?

13:45.240 --> 13:47.071
Not my ex-wife, that's for sure.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.833
I just feel a passing acquaintance
isn't enough.

13:49.920 --> 13:54.357
For example, Pete's first marriage
lasted 12 years, that's a pretty good knock.

13:54.440 --> 13:55.793
He's divorced!

13:55.880 --> 13:59.429
Barely. I had to bring the certificate out.
The ink's still wet.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.478
Don't get me wrong. You know,
Jo is terrific.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.994
Lovely. Very sexy.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.278
Lovely.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.112
But why do they have to get married?

14:10.280 --> 14:14.637
Why don't they just live together, have a
couple of kids and split up? Like normal people.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.392
Yeah.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.915
Well, you're his best mate.
- And his best man.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.070
It's up to you to say something.
- Me?

14:22.160 --> 14:26.392
Yeah. Well, if you think he's making a
mistake. And you really care about him.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.518
Yeah.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.158
Hi.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.714
Hey.
- We haven't had a chance to talk.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.030
No.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.194
It looks like there's...not much to say.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.676
Well, I could start with ''sorry''.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.032
Ancient history.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.395
Still seems pretty recent to me.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.316
Jo, why are you getting married?

15:02.400 --> 15:05.119
Because I want to.
- You wanted to marry me.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.633
Once.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.198
Anyway, you weren't that keen.
- But we were engaged.

15:10.280 --> 15:13.829
Yeah, and we still would be, Shawn.
That's why we broke up.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.156
So, do you love this bloke?

15:17.920 --> 15:19.353
Pete? No.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.078
No, I'm just doing it to spite you.
What do you think?

15:24.480 --> 15:26.596
I can't see what you see in him.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.750
Well, I wouldn't expect you to.

15:28.840 --> 15:32.116
No. I'm not saying I'm better than
him, but...

15:33.560 --> 15:35.516
Christ, you are.

15:42.760 --> 15:48.630
Look, erm...I don't really know how to say
this, but er...it's got to be said.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.231
Are you sure you're doing the right thing,
getting married?

15:53.320 --> 15:55.276
I mean, what's wrong with dating?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.638
We want to get married.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.109
Why?
- Because we love each other.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.272
How do you know that?
You've only been going out a month.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.598
Look, erm...

16:07.680 --> 16:10.752
Do you remember
when you bought the first album by Madness?

16:10.840 --> 16:13.877
You played nothing else.
Wall to wall One Step Beyond.

16:13.960 --> 16:17.555
Two weeks later it was driving you crazy.
- That's Madness for you.

16:17.640 --> 16:21.872
I'd hum it in lessons, get a rise out of you.
- Yeah, I remember, you bastard.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.110
Do you not think that Jo might be the same?

16:29.120 --> 16:31.076
What, as the first album by Madness?

16:31.160 --> 16:33.116
No, a passing fancy.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.916
How well do you know each other?

16:36.960 --> 16:40.589
Well enough to know she's the love of
my life. - No, she's not. Jenny is!

16:40.680 --> 16:43.069
I'm divorced from Jenny.
- You're on the rebound.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.435
Is that what you think?
- Yes.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.670
And you've come all this way
to tell me that.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.718
I don't want you being a hypocrite,
next to me at the altar.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.837
What? - If that's how you feel,
forget being best man.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.878
You can forget the whole thing at all.
Just forget it!

17:07.560 --> 17:09.630
Are you missing the children?
- Yes.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.232
Then again...

17:14.680 --> 17:16.636
We'll bring them next time.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.036
Oh, Josh would love it here.

17:22.079 --> 17:24.913
It must be a great place to bring
children up. - Mm.

17:25.800 --> 17:30.032
Well, you know...apart from the snakes,
the sharks and the killer spiders.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.756
Mind the crocodile.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.073
I could be really happy here.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.632
Yes, we could.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.157
Look, we could you know?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.879
Yeah. Nice idea. Come on.
Don't want to be late.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.836
So, what was the craic with Lucy?

17:58.600 --> 18:00.318
Yeah, fine.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.436
That's not very enthusiastic.

18:05.560 --> 18:08.199
Well, she has some daft ideas sometimes.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.236
Oh, yeah, like what?

18:11.280 --> 18:14.590
Like...
she's thinking of sleeping with some bloke.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.918
Oh!

18:18.480 --> 18:20.436
That's a good thing, isn't it?

18:21.160 --> 18:22.832
Why?

18:22.920 --> 18:25.354
Well, there's nothing wrong with being gay.

18:25.440 --> 18:29.069
Unless you want to offend God.
But if she wants to switch sides...

18:30.920 --> 18:34.230
No, no. Hang on.
That's the whole thing. She doesn't.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.276
She doesn't want to switch sides.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.592
Well, why does she want to ride a bloke?
Is she a lesbian or not?

18:40.680 --> 18:44.229
Well, I don't want to.
But if I'm going to have a baby.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.355
You want to have a baby?
- Yeah.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.829
Desperately. I have done for ages.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.517
Right, so...so this bloke...

18:52.600 --> 18:55.751
Which bloke?
- The one you're going to sleep with.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.673
Oh, I haven't chosen him yet.
I'm still vetting.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.078
<i>What if it doesn't work out?</i>

19:01.160 --> 19:05.233
She'll move on to the next man.
Don't you think that's just outrageous?

19:05.320 --> 19:07.675
Well, yeah. Men have feelings too.

19:07.760 --> 19:12.231
Not that. That she's contemplating unprotected
sex with God knows how many men.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.556
So, what did you say to her?

19:15.640 --> 19:18.154
I think it's a ridiculous idea and
I won't allow it.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.550
Look, it's easy for you, you are pregnant.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.596
Believe me, it was not easy.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.318
Well, whatever.

19:25.400 --> 19:30.428
The point is, I want to have children,
and I can have children, so why shouldn't I?

19:30.520 --> 19:32.590
Fine, but sleeping around...

19:32.680 --> 19:35.433
My God,
I'd rather you shagged Adam than did that.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.476
You said what?
- Well, I would.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.278
That was fantastic!

19:44.320 --> 19:46.754
What an amazing surprise. Blimey.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.595
Wasn't Cio-Cio-San brilliant?
- I didn't really notice her.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.636
David, it's the main character.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.676
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.990
Karen, you look so beautiful tonight.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.237
What, just tonight?

20:04.040 --> 20:05.996
<i>I love Sydney.</i>

20:06.960 --> 20:08.916
And I love you, Karen.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.156
I know you do.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.196
I know it's crap to say this, but...

20:25.520 --> 20:28.512
You know, if I could just...
turn the clock back...

20:28.600 --> 20:30.318
David, it's in the past.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.356
But it's not, is it?

20:33.440 --> 20:37.035
Even though, you know, thank God,
we're back together, I...

20:37.120 --> 20:40.237
My...you know, what I did,

20:40.320 --> 20:42.276
it still hangs between us.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.150
I know there are many women

20:45.240 --> 20:49.313
who think that once a man has cheated,
then he can do it again.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.551
And, maybe with some men that's true, but...

20:54.800 --> 20:56.756
I am devoted to you, Karen.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.475
I do understand, you know.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.036
We've both made mistakes.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.868
Maybe it's time we tried to put
them behind us.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.836
<i>You had sex!</i>

21:31.920 --> 21:33.433
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:34.160 --> 21:37.038
It was better than that, actually.
We made love.

21:39.520 --> 21:41.476
Oh, Karen, that's brilliant.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.516
Yeah. It's good, isn't it?

21:46.280 --> 21:48.430
And er...dare I ask about...

21:48.520 --> 21:50.317
Mark.
- Yeah.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.916
I'm going to send him an email.

21:55.640 --> 21:58.518
I thought you weren't
going to get in touch with him.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.276
I need to tell him it's over.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.516
I reckon it's about time
you and me had a little chat.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.352
All right.

22:32.920 --> 22:35.480
Fancy a game of pool?
- Yep.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.718
I've been round the block a few times, Pete.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.950
I know a thing or two about a thing or two.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.797
Where the bodies are buried?

23:00.880 --> 23:03.075
Some people think I buried a few myself.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.031
That's amazing!

23:07.840 --> 23:09.796
Yeah, I designed it myself.

23:10.520 --> 23:15.230
The point is, I reckon I'm a pretty good judge
of character and I think I've got your number.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.477
So, let's get down to business.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.356
What is it you want?

23:22.480 --> 23:24.550
Sorry, I'm not sure I understand.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.511
Fifteen? Twenty thousand?

23:27.600 --> 23:29.556
I'm talking English, not Australian.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.793
You're trying to buy me off?
- Well...

23:34.880 --> 23:36.836
I prefer to think of it as...

23:39.640 --> 23:41.596
..as a wedding present.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.636
Provided there's no wedding.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.915
I roughly earn ooh...

23:51.920 --> 23:53.558
27000 pounds a year.

23:53.640 --> 23:57.428
27? OK, if that's what you want.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.078
No.

24:02.800 --> 24:06.429
What I want you to understand
is how much I care about Jo.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.997
You've got me wrong.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.913
I don't want your money.
I just love your daughter.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.835
I must admit, I didn't think we'd be
seeing you.

24:26.920 --> 24:30.469
Usually when the top brass comes over
they can't seem to find the office.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.028
Lose their bearings somewhere around Bondi.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.873
To be honest,
I'm only intending to do it the once.

24:36.600 --> 24:40.275
So, how long have you been out here?
- In Sydney? A couple of years.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.798
Just getting to grips with the natives.
- Oh, right.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.633
So do you have much contact
with the Aboriginals?

24:48.640 --> 24:50.392
I used to be based in London.

24:50.480 --> 24:53.711
Getting a ferry to work beats taking
the tube to Tottenham Court Road.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.836
Or the M602 into Manchester.
- Yes.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.876
Still, can't let the grass grow.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.996
I'm moving on. Leaving DZQ.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.036
Joining PBT in LA.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.680
When?
- ASAP. Well, that's when they want me.

25:04.760 --> 25:09.629
I suppose I'll have to serve out my notice here.
Unless they appoint my successor before then.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.676
Me?
- I'm sorry.

25:12.560 --> 25:16.189
I reckon I could do your job.
- Oh, well, I dare say you could, David.

25:16.280 --> 25:20.592
But I doubt the board would appoint someone
with no experience of the Australian market,

25:20.680 --> 25:22.716
however good your standing in the UK.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.472
Oh, I don't know.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.516
I wish Lucy lived a bit closer.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.795
Yeah. Well, maybe she'll come back.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.438
Would you?

25:32.520 --> 25:34.511
Anyway, she seems happy enough.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.795
Well, except for not having a child.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.950
Well, we can always visit her, can't we?

25:42.840 --> 25:44.796
Yeah.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.836
Yeah, that would be nice.

25:48.120 --> 25:50.634
<i>Doesn't Matthew take after his mum, eh?</i>

25:50.720 --> 25:53.473
Well, more than Amy.
She looks like Adam, not you.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.515
<i>Say cheese.
- Cheese!</i>

25:59.720 --> 26:01.676
Adam, come on!

26:03.280 --> 26:05.032
Sorry.

26:05.120 --> 26:08.237
So tourism must be
one of the biggest growth industries here.

26:08.320 --> 26:12.359
Tourism, financial services, construction.
There's a lot of building going on.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.237
Building?
- Mm.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.390
The wedding we've come over for,
the bride's father is a builder.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.040
Rod Ellison. Do you know of him?
- Yes. Big company.

26:21.120 --> 26:25.159
We've been trying to get work with them
for quite a while. Haven't cracked it yet.

26:25.240 --> 26:28.391
Hello, darling. Gosh, you look fantastic.

26:28.480 --> 26:32.109
This is Stewart Mayhew, who heads up
our office here. This is Karen, my wife.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.952
Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

26:34.040 --> 26:37.510
They've told me our table's ready.
- I've asked Stewart to join us.

26:37.600 --> 26:41.036
He'll fill me in on the business. Do you
mind? - No, that's lovely.

26:41.120 --> 26:43.076
Let's get our table.

26:44.120 --> 26:48.557
Don't breathe a word to Karen about what
we discussed. I want it to be a surprise.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.758
What time did you wake?

26:53.840 --> 26:55.796
Two, four and six.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.639
What about you?
- One, three and five.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.836
Ah, the joys of jet lag.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.792
What about the little fella?
Did he have a better night?

27:08.720 --> 27:11.996
I don't know, but he's right on my bladder.
I'll just get up.

27:14.520 --> 27:16.909
What are we going to do today, then?
- Er...

27:17.000 --> 27:20.310
I don't know. Go down to the beach?

27:20.400 --> 27:23.073
I'II get it, I'II get it.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.116
Oh, Jeez, I'm there.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.078
Hi-hi hi-hi.

27:34.160 --> 27:36.355
Erm, look, you got my message, yeah?

27:36.440 --> 27:38.431
Yeah. All very cloak-and-dagger.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.636
Yeah, erm, can we meet downstairs?

27:40.720 --> 27:43.075
OK. Shall I just say hello to Rach?

27:43.160 --> 27:45.754
No, no, no, no, no, no.
She mustn't know you're here.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.512
Half an hour, OK?
- OK.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.556
Great. See you then.

27:58.120 --> 28:00.793
The Museum of Contemporary Art looks good.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.949
Yes. Yeah, that sounds very...interesting.

28:06.360 --> 28:10.911
Did you bring any casual clothes at all?
- I'm afraid I've got to pop to the office.

28:12.160 --> 28:15.152
Just briefly. Before I have a meeting
with Rod.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.276
David, this was meant to be a holiday.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.996
Well, a partly working holiday.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.590
This shouldn't take me too long.
And it could prove very worthwhile.

28:26.360 --> 28:31.036
Yeah, well, all work and no play
makes Jack a very dull husband.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.315
Ah, you just wait.
- Yeah.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.508
<i>What a surprise!
Did you have a good journey?</i>

28:37.600 --> 28:39.238
Who is it?

28:40.280 --> 28:41.918
Hi.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.911
A surprise, I know.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.833
Mark.
- Wasn't expecting it myself.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.469
How are you?
- Sit down. Have some breakfast.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.278
No, I'm fine, thanks.

28:53.360 --> 28:56.830
What are you doing here?
- I had to see that author about a signing.

28:56.920 --> 28:59.434
Gosh, that's a long way. I hope
they're worth it.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.556
Look...are you busy today?

29:03.640 --> 29:05.198
No. No, I'm not.

29:05.280 --> 29:08.716
It's just that er...
if you're interested in modern art?

29:08.800 --> 29:11.439
Yeah? It's just not really quite my thing.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.556
It sounds good.
- Excellent.

29:14.640 --> 29:17.677
Excellent. Must dash. I'll try and
call you later.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.796
Good to see you, Mark. Good to see you.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.433
Hiya.
- Pete!

29:26.520 --> 29:29.034
Is Adam in?
- No, he's just popped out for a minute.

29:29.120 --> 29:32.157
Mind you, that was half an hour ago.
Come in. - Thanks.

29:32.240 --> 29:35.073
You know we've had a row?
- Yeah. What was it about?

29:35.160 --> 29:37.116
Oh, it's nothing important.

29:38.320 --> 29:41.471
He's told you what he thinks about
the wedding, hasn't he?

29:41.560 --> 29:45.792
Oh, God! I told him to keep it to himself,
let people make their own mistakes.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.154
Do you think the wedding's a mistake
as well?

29:51.880 --> 29:53.598
No, I don't, actually.

29:53.680 --> 29:55.511
No, I don't.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.708
Anyway, who cares what other people think?

29:59.680 --> 30:04.117
At weddings people always have an opinion
as to whether the marriage is going to last.

30:04.200 --> 30:07.670
You know how often they're right?
- What, they've done research?

30:07.760 --> 30:11.673
As often as they are wrong.
Because it's a lottery, Pete.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.035
So, do you think we should get married?

30:14.120 --> 30:16.395
If that's what you want to do.

30:16.480 --> 30:20.598
You don't think I'm on the rebound?
- Pete, only you can know that.

30:21.640 --> 30:24.359
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Yeah.
Thanks, Rach.

30:25.080 --> 30:26.832
My pleasure.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.310
You don't fancy being best man, do you?

30:30.400 --> 30:32.868
At least I don't have to
cancel the honeymoon.

30:32.960 --> 30:35.793
Where are you going?
- It's a surprise. Great Barrier Reef.

30:35.880 --> 30:38.075
Don't tell Jen, though.

30:38.160 --> 30:39.957
Jen?
- Jo.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.958
You know that song,
50 Ways To Leave Your Lover?

30:48.760 --> 30:50.716
I don't think it included email.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.756
I'm sorry.

30:52.840 --> 30:55.513
I'm sorry. I did want to tell you
to your face.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.236
Well, now you can.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.276
Now, just one minute.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.956
You and me, it wasn't an accident.

31:03.680 --> 31:08.549
We'd both got problems with our marriages
and all of a sudden, bang, yours is fine again.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.396
It is getting better.

31:12.960 --> 31:17.033
Really? Why isn't David with you now, then?
- Because he's at the office.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.758
You know that.

31:20.320 --> 31:23.869
He's got a lot of responsibility, Mark.
- You sound like his PR.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.870
I'll tell you something, Karen, listen.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.110
You know, you never come second with me.

31:30.040 --> 31:33.350
I've flown halfway across the bloody planet
to tell you this.

31:33.440 --> 31:36.238
Yeah, I know. And it is an amazing gesture.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.556
Well, I don't do gestures, do I?

31:41.320 --> 31:42.639
Karen...

31:44.880 --> 31:46.836
..I've left Geraldine.

31:49.280 --> 31:53.353
I'm sleeping on a sofa in my office
because I love you.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.590
I'm desperate for us to be together now.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.035
You just tell me that you don't love me

31:58.120 --> 32:01.556
and I'll go straight to the airport
and get the first plane home.

32:05.240 --> 32:10.155
The great thing is, I'm thinking from your point of
view here, we don't even have to sleep together.

32:10.240 --> 32:13.550
Because I've got all this sperm banked.
Buckets of it.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.200
Just sitting there waiting to be useful.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.555
Have you discussed this with Rachel?

32:18.640 --> 32:23.760
No, no. Not yet. But I don't think there'll be
a problem. It was her idea in the first place.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.273
Are you mad?
- Why?

32:25.360 --> 32:27.237
You want to have a baby with my sister!

32:27.320 --> 32:30.278
What's wrong with that?
OK, ordinarily, but you know...

32:30.360 --> 32:33.557
We're unlikely to have another,
you don't want Lucy sleeping around,

32:33.640 --> 32:36.791
and I like the idea of another
Williams on the side of the world.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.917
You've had too much sun.
It's like something on Ricki Lake.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.835
It won't be a problem. And the bump will have a
cousin in Australia more like a brother or sister.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.388
Adam, it will be a brother or sister. No!

32:47.480 --> 32:49.914
Absolutely not, Lucy. It's disgusting!

32:52.960 --> 32:57.238
You see, you'd get the best advice,
borrowing on our expertise worldwide.

32:57.320 --> 33:01.279
And a dedicated team led by
one of our most senior and gifted executives

33:01.360 --> 33:04.591
who would relocate to Sydney
specifically for this project.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.636
Do you ever take a holiday?

33:08.880 --> 33:12.759
Let me see some figures. And maybe
you should meet my management team.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.513
What time do you get to work in the morning?
- Seven.

33:16.600 --> 33:19.717
Those figures will be on your desk.
- Excellent.

33:19.800 --> 33:22.075
Come and have dinner with me tonight.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.230
I can't.
- Yes, you can.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.754
Just tell David we need to discuss business.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.676
He'll understand that.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.153
Look...we already have plans
for dinner tonight.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.996
What about tomorrow?

33:36.080 --> 33:38.036
Why don't we spend the day together?

33:38.120 --> 33:39.235
Hello.

33:39.320 --> 33:40.878
Maree, I need a cab.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.552
David, it's me.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.154
Oh, sorry, darling, I meant to
call the office.

33:46.240 --> 33:50.711
Look, whilst you're on, I'm afrald I'm not
going to be able to make dinner tonight.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.199
David.
- No, look.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.714
Somethlng's come up.
It could work out well for us.

33:54.800 --> 33:58.110
Very well indeed. I need to crunch
a few figures in the office.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.668
David!
- It's only one night.

34:00.760 --> 34:02.751
Erm...why don't you see Rachel?

34:02.840 --> 34:04.717
Oh, and darling...
- What?

34:04.800 --> 34:07.553
Have you got the number of a cab firm?

34:09.840 --> 34:11.795
Everything all right?

34:11.880 --> 34:13.393
Don't ask.

34:14.360 --> 34:19.309
I need figures for new house building for the
past five years and Ellison's share of the market.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.833
Oh, and Maree. Phone Charles in Manchester.

34:21.920 --> 34:25.833
Tell him to go to the office and email me
the pitch we put together for Artemis.

34:25.920 --> 34:28.388
You know it's the middle of the night
in Britain?

34:28.480 --> 34:30.710
So, there won't be much traffic on the road.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.679
Thanks.

34:35.760 --> 34:38.320
Anything else I can do to help?
- No thanks, Stewart.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.231
Yep, just one thing.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.230
The desk in your office is larger.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.632
Marsden.
No, he's not on this extension any more.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.510
Maree, can we get these phones sorted?

34:59.720 --> 35:02.871
Thank you so much for a really
wonderful day, Karen.

35:05.520 --> 35:09.149
I'd better be getting back.
David might be back at the apartment.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.598
Or you...

35:14.000 --> 35:16.514
..could come to my hotel for a nightcap.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.193
So...
do you think we know each other really well?

35:25.280 --> 35:26.998
I...think I know you.

35:27.080 --> 35:29.036
Oh! Do you now?

35:29.120 --> 35:33.830
Peter Algernon Gifford, born 12th
April 1969, which makes you Aries.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.677
Pretty easy to read.
- Yeah. Now, about that date.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.356
It is the 12th?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

35:41.080 --> 35:44.959
See, I don't forget things like that.
But then again, I am a Gemini.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.349
Now, you are...June...
- Mm.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.396
the er...

35:49.480 --> 35:51.835
18th.
- Oh, God, I didn't know that.

35:51.920 --> 35:54.559
And we're getting married!
Doesn't that worry you?

35:54.640 --> 35:56.835
Well...I'll send you reminders.

35:56.920 --> 36:00.276
Oh, God, there's so many things
we don't know about each other.

36:00.360 --> 36:03.909
Like, I mean... Did you have
any pets as a child?

36:04.000 --> 36:05.956
Have you ever been to Poland?

36:06.040 --> 36:08.156
Do you like tapioca?

36:08.240 --> 36:12.074
We'll be stood at the altar in a couple of
days and there's so much we don't know.

36:12.160 --> 36:15.311
We'll be exchanging vows, not
playing Mr & Mrs.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.032
OK...um...

36:20.120 --> 36:23.476
I had a pet rabbit named Bungee.
No, I've never been to Poland.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.312
I don't even know what tapioca is.

36:25.400 --> 36:28.153
No, look, Jo, I'm serious here.
I mean, big things.

36:29.040 --> 36:31.031
Like children. How many kids do you want?

36:31.120 --> 36:33.554
I don't know. One or two.
How many do you want?

36:33.640 --> 36:35.790
Five.
- What?

36:35.880 --> 36:38.269
Well, maybe, maybe not. What if I do?

36:38.360 --> 36:41.636
Does that include little Adam?
- It's just a number I made up.

36:41.720 --> 36:43.392
Well, how many do you want?

36:44.280 --> 36:47.795
Erm...I don't know. One or two.
- Well, that's fine, then.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.954
Yeah, unless you want one and I want two.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.632
Oh!

37:04.440 --> 37:06.396
I do really love you, you know.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.072
Mark, you know the other times
you've been unfaithful?

37:16.160 --> 37:17.957
I've told you...

37:18.880 --> 37:20.632
You're different.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.237
I know.

37:24.320 --> 37:28.359
You said it was because you were
having difficult times with Geraldine.

37:29.320 --> 37:30.514
Mm.

37:31.480 --> 37:33.835
What happens when we have difficult times?

37:35.240 --> 37:37.117
We won't.

37:42.600 --> 37:45.353
Karen,
you know we're going to have to tell David.

37:45.440 --> 37:47.078
I know.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.830
Let me find the right time, OK?

37:51.920 --> 37:54.434
Karen, I...I want you to...

37:54.520 --> 37:56.158
Mark...

37:58.960 --> 38:01.030
..I've got my children to think about.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.233
Mm.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.234
Everything all right, Princess?
- Mm-hm.

38:20.360 --> 38:23.830
Most girls in the run-up to their wedding
would be walking on air.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.673
Maybe they have more support
from those around them.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.512
I haven't said a word.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.239
You don't have to. Your silence
speaks volumes.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.553
That's because
I know better than to get involved.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.915
But if you ask me, you're making a mistake.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.993
Dad, you'd say that about anyone.
Nobody's good enough for your little girl.

38:44.080 --> 38:46.389
Well, this guy isn't!
- You don't know him!

38:46.480 --> 38:50.439
And neither do you by the sounds of it!
Face it, you're his meal ticket.

38:50.520 --> 38:53.034
One look at this place, he thinks he's made!

38:53.120 --> 38:56.715
We were engaged before he came here!
- He saw my boat!

38:56.800 --> 38:59.792
I proposed to him!
- Oh!

38:59.880 --> 39:03.589
He got you to do his dirty work for him.
- Oh, God! You're pathetic!

39:03.680 --> 39:05.955
And you're not listening!

39:06.040 --> 39:08.508
I will not have you marrying this bloke!

39:08.600 --> 39:10.795
You can't tell me what to do.

39:10.880 --> 39:11.949
No.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.676
No, but I can promise you this.

39:14.760 --> 39:18.833
If this wedding goes ahead,
you will never set foot in this place again.

39:18.920 --> 39:20.717
Either of you.

39:22.280 --> 39:24.236
Like I give a shit.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.511
I think we should call the wedding off.

39:40.680 --> 39:42.159
What?

39:42.240 --> 39:45.391
Maybe we've rushed into things.
You know, got carried away.

39:46.560 --> 39:49.199
You want to cancel the wedding?
- Postpone it.

39:49.280 --> 39:51.430
Till when?
- I don't know.

39:51.520 --> 39:53.476
When the time seems right.

39:55.080 --> 39:57.753
Do you have any idea
what I've put up with for you?

39:57.840 --> 39:59.159
Yes.

39:59.240 --> 40:01.800
My dad thinks you're a piece of shit!

40:03.080 --> 40:04.593
Maybe he's right.

40:04.680 --> 40:05.795
Jo!

40:05.880 --> 40:07.233
Get out.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.595
What?
- Get out!

40:09.680 --> 40:12.433
Go and stay with your mates.
- Jo, wait.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.511
No! I never want to see you again, Pete.

40:14.600 --> 40:17.592
You're dumping me?
- No, you idiot. You're dumping me!

40:17.680 --> 40:22.595
No! I just don't want us to get
married...right now!

40:22.680 --> 40:25.433
I said...get...out.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.239
Jo, you're overreacting.
- Go!

40:35.280 --> 40:38.317
And I can't talk to any of his
friends because...

40:38.400 --> 40:40.356
well, they're his friends.

40:41.480 --> 40:44.313
And I'm sorry to dump all this
on you. I just...

40:46.000 --> 40:47.956
Hey. Hey, hey...

40:48.960 --> 40:50.837
You know I'm there for you.

40:50.920 --> 40:53.150
Oh, God. I'm just a disaster.

40:53.240 --> 40:55.470
First you...now Pete.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.755
Yeah, well, if you ask me,
he's a bloody idiot.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.718
Shawn, please don't start that again.
- No, no.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.439
I mean, for letting you slip through
his fingers.

41:10.280 --> 41:12.350
Hey, we had some good times, didn't we?

41:12.440 --> 41:14.590
When we weren't having bad times, yeah.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.432
Well, that only came later.

41:16.520 --> 41:19.353
When I wouldn't set a date for the wedding.

41:22.120 --> 41:23.235
Yeah.

41:25.160 --> 41:29.199
Jo, since you left, there hasn't been a day
that I haven't thought about you.

41:29.280 --> 41:32.397
I wondered...whether you'd ever come home...

41:32.480 --> 41:34.675
Whether you'd call me, if you did.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.716
Shawn, please...
- Jo.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.876
I kept your engagement ring.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.720
It's still got the mark where you
threw it at me!

41:51.560 --> 41:54.438
Not marrying you
was the biggest mistake of my life.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.836
But I'm ready to put it right.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.358
I love you, Jo.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.479
Marry me.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.956
What?

42:08.040 --> 42:09.996
Are you out of your mind?

42:11.280 --> 42:13.396
This isn't about you and me.

42:15.960 --> 42:17.951
I can't believe you!

42:18.040 --> 42:20.759
Do you have any idea what I've been through?

42:23.240 --> 42:25.037
<i>What a mess.</i>

42:25.120 --> 42:27.953
I try and do the right thing
and it blows up in my face.

42:28.040 --> 42:29.792
Sorry, mate.

42:30.520 --> 42:33.671
Hang on. I thought you didn't want
the wedding to happen.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.115
No, I didn't. But I don't want this, either.

42:37.480 --> 42:39.436
I do still love her, you know.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.830
So what decided you? The Jenny thing?

42:43.720 --> 42:45.676
Rachel told me.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.596
Yeah, well, that did spook me a bit.

42:49.640 --> 42:52.677
But these things happen, don't they?
- Yeah, they do.

42:52.760 --> 42:54.716
No. Oh, it was...

42:54.800 --> 42:56.631
It was her dad.

42:56.720 --> 42:58.597
He was dead set against it.

42:58.680 --> 43:03.037
If we'd got married there'd have been a rift.
A piece of paper's not worth that.

43:03.880 --> 43:07.316
But I never thought it would be her
that kicked me into touch.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.311
Well, she's been there before.

43:10.360 --> 43:12.749
You what?
- Yeah. With Shawn.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.035
He was her fiance?
- She didn't tell you?

43:19.720 --> 43:21.676
We really didn't know each other.

43:22.840 --> 43:27.072
Look...I've got to go over to her place
and pick up some stuff.

43:27.160 --> 43:30.232
You couldn't do it for me?
I really couldn't face it.

43:30.320 --> 43:33.232
Yeah, yeah, course I will.
- Cheers, mate. Thanks.

43:33.320 --> 43:35.276
Mark's in Sydney?
- Yeah.

43:41.280 --> 43:43.236
I'm leaving David, Rach.

43:45.240 --> 43:47.196
Oh, Karen...

43:50.360 --> 43:52.316
What about your children?

43:54.920 --> 43:58.390
Listen, I came here with the intention of
giving this my best shot.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.630
Yeah, and you seemed happier.
- Yeah.

44:03.280 --> 44:05.840
Initially. Till David reverted to type.

44:10.040 --> 44:11.996
He's not the man I married, Rach.

44:15.960 --> 44:20.511
For two years I've felt like I've been drowning
and David's been holding me under.

44:27.440 --> 44:30.079
He's married to his work, Rach.
That's his life.

44:31.120 --> 44:33.076
And I need more than that.

44:38.920 --> 44:41.354
The sad fact is, we want different things.

44:41.440 --> 44:44.512
And Mark wants those things too, does he?
- Don't know.

44:47.320 --> 44:49.276
But I know David.

44:59.560 --> 45:01.232
I am sorry, you know.

45:01.320 --> 45:04.551
Adam, don't think I don't know
your part in all this.

45:04.640 --> 45:07.074
I have never been opposed to you and Pete.

45:07.160 --> 45:08.752
No, just us getting married.

45:08.840 --> 45:09.955
Yeah.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.116
Well, who died and made you God?

45:21.280 --> 45:23.350
Think he wants his wedding present?

45:23.440 --> 45:25.396
Oh, yeah. What did you get him?

45:36.120 --> 45:38.839
A football shirt?
- Not just any.

45:39.960 --> 45:43.714
Pete told me how the year he was born
his team won this real big trophy.

45:43.800 --> 45:46.473
Mm-hm. Manchester City.

45:47.560 --> 45:50.518
It's the one they wore
when they won the FA Cup in '69.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.639
Pete told you he was born in 1969?
- Yeah.

45:54.720 --> 45:56.676
Are you sure about that?

45:57.400 --> 46:00.392
Pete was born in 1968.
- No, he wasn't.

46:00.480 --> 46:03.950
Yes, he was. Same year as me.
We were in sixth form together.

46:04.040 --> 46:07.589
But when we first went out, he told me...
- He lied about his age.

46:08.400 --> 46:10.391
You mean this is the wrong shirt?

46:10.480 --> 46:13.756
Wrong club, mate!
Manchester United, European Cup, 1968!

46:14.840 --> 46:16.796
Oh, here, look...um...

46:16.880 --> 46:18.836
I wasn't laughing at you.

46:19.880 --> 46:22.030
I just wanted it to be special, you know?

46:23.080 --> 46:28.029
Do you know how much time I spent trying to
think of something he'd really get a kick out of?

46:29.080 --> 46:31.230
Do you know how long that took me to find?

46:31.320 --> 46:33.390
Yeah, well, they don't have many fans.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.309
Oh, look...um... Here...

46:38.400 --> 46:40.118
Thanks.

46:42.320 --> 46:44.276
I just wanted to make him happy.

46:45.640 --> 46:48.074
Oh, Jesus. You really love him, don't you?

46:48.160 --> 46:49.957
Yeah.

46:50.760 --> 46:52.512
Jo, darling...

46:53.560 --> 46:57.951
..just because you're not getting married
doesn't mean you have to finish with each other.

46:59.120 --> 47:00.712
Adam...

47:01.600 --> 47:04.034
What, you think we can forget
about all this?

47:04.120 --> 47:06.076
Just go back to the way we were?

47:07.120 --> 47:08.633
We're through.

47:10.480 --> 47:13.836
Where's your dad?
- I don't know. I think he's seeing David.

47:13.920 --> 47:15.876
I need to speak to him.

47:16.880 --> 47:18.836
Adam, what about Pete's clothes?

47:19.760 --> 47:21.352
Great.

47:23.480 --> 47:25.436
Rod? Yeah, I'm seeing him shortly.

47:25.520 --> 47:29.149
Where? I'll come, too.
- You can't. We're having a meeting.

47:29.240 --> 47:32.835
Look, I've got to. It's important.
- Can't be as important as my meeting.

47:33.880 --> 47:37.759
Look, Adam, I'll pass on a message.
I'm afraid that's the best I can do.

47:39.560 --> 47:40.913
Jesus!

47:43.400 --> 47:45.470
Are you for Marsden?
- Yeah, sure.

47:52.360 --> 47:53.713
Follow that cab!

47:57.320 --> 47:59.914
<i>It's a shared house a long way from home.</i>

48:00.000 --> 48:02.434
<i>You can always move back if
you're not happy.</i>

48:02.520 --> 48:05.398
To what? My job's here. My friends are.

48:06.120 --> 48:09.556
I'm stuck.
- I can think of worse places to be stuck.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.153
Look at that.

48:11.240 --> 48:13.196
Well, what would you know about it?

48:13.280 --> 48:15.236
I mean, your life is perfect.

48:16.360 --> 48:18.590
Lucy, it was your choice to come out here.

48:18.680 --> 48:23.470
Oh, yeah, right. I was young, gay,
living with a bigot for a father.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.915
You think I had a choice? You've
got no idea.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.355
I had to put up with the flak
once you'd gone.

48:29.080 --> 48:32.675
Whenever I went home, all I ever heard about
was his bloody precious Lucy!

48:32.760 --> 48:34.796
Well, at least you could go home.

48:35.560 --> 48:38.233
And who's mates with him now, thanks to me?

48:39.000 --> 48:41.389
Oh, and I thought Mother Teresa was dead.

48:41.480 --> 48:44.074
You think you're the only one with problems.

48:44.160 --> 48:46.116
Well, compared to you!

48:46.200 --> 48:49.033
You're happily married,
you've got a baby on the way...

48:49.120 --> 48:51.350
Hang on. Is that what this is about?

48:51.440 --> 48:54.034
Because I won't let you use Adam's sperm?

48:54.120 --> 48:58.272
My God. You're holding that against me?
- Well, he doesn't seem to mind.

48:58.360 --> 49:01.909
No, cos he's bloody stupid
and he doesn't think things through.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.956
Oh, shit!
- Rachel!

49:04.040 --> 49:06.270
Sorry.
- What? What?

49:19.280 --> 49:21.236
Keep the change.

49:22.480 --> 49:24.118
Sorry.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.437
..remains our number one pri...

49:33.520 --> 49:35.431
Ah, David.
- Rod.

49:35.520 --> 49:37.351
Adam.
- Sorry. We need to talk.

49:37.440 --> 49:38.919
Not now.
- Really?

49:39.000 --> 49:41.434
Pete and Jo.
You've got to give them your blessing.

49:43.160 --> 49:45.276
This is not the time or place, Adam.

49:45.360 --> 49:47.032
I agree.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.838
I don't care.

49:51.560 --> 49:55.758
Look, Rod...I know Jo
is the most important person in your life.

49:55.840 --> 49:57.876
You'd do anything to keep her from harm.

49:57.960 --> 49:59.791
But come here to me.

49:59.880 --> 50:01.711
You are harming her.

50:01.800 --> 50:04.519
Pete called off the wedding
for the sake of you and her.

50:04.600 --> 50:07.558
Now she thinks he doesn't love her -
but he does, and she does him.

50:07.640 --> 50:10.200
They deserve to be happy - with each other.

50:11.120 --> 50:14.908
Rod, I know you don't think
that Pete is good enough for Jo.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.309
But you're wrong.

50:17.400 --> 50:19.516
I know the heart of the man.

50:20.240 --> 50:22.708
And with respect, it's none
of your business.

50:23.600 --> 50:26.831
Are you going to tell me
I'm wrong about this bloke as well?

50:26.920 --> 50:28.638
Well, I...

50:33.600 --> 50:35.556
Look, Rod, I...

50:36.480 --> 50:38.436
I've got two daughters, and...

50:39.440 --> 50:45.595
if either of them marry someone as sound
and caring and good-natured as Pete, then...

50:45.680 --> 50:48.399
not only wouId I thank my lucky stars but...

50:48.480 --> 50:52.155
you know, I'd reckon I'd done
a pretty good job bringing her up.

50:59.120 --> 51:01.076
Let's get on with this meeting.

51:07.720 --> 51:09.790
Everything seems to be OK now.

51:09.880 --> 51:11.871
Your blood pressure's a little high.

51:11.960 --> 51:14.997
Might be good to spend a few days in bed.
Plenty of sleep.

51:15.080 --> 51:17.469
I've got a wedding at the weekend.

51:17.560 --> 51:20.836
Well, see how you feel on the day.
In the meantime, stay put.

51:20.920 --> 51:22.956
I'll see myself out.
- Thank you.

51:25.480 --> 51:27.550
Will you phone me a taxi, Luce?

51:27.640 --> 51:30.438
You heard what he said. You're staying put.

51:30.520 --> 51:32.556
I can't stay here. You've got no room.

51:32.640 --> 51:34.596
Well, at least for tonight.

51:35.560 --> 51:37.039
All right.

51:37.120 --> 51:39.793
Will you get hold of Adam for me?
- Yeah.

51:41.480 --> 51:43.118
Thanks.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.792
Oooh...

51:45.920 --> 51:48.798
Right, I'll have the office bike over
the contracts.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.836
Excellent work, David.

51:55.400 --> 51:57.356
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

52:05.280 --> 52:06.838
<i>Hi.</i>

52:16.280 --> 52:18.236
Are you OK?
- Mm.

52:19.680 --> 52:21.636
What did the doctor say?

52:21.720 --> 52:23.676
He said I should get lots of sleep.

52:25.160 --> 52:27.355
Sorry.
- I'm glad you're here.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.396
Now that you're awake...um...

52:35.000 --> 52:36.956
This thing with Lucy...

52:37.040 --> 52:39.235
It's not a great idea, is it?

52:41.000 --> 52:42.911
Well, you know...

52:44.240 --> 52:47.232
When we thought
that you couldn't have children...

52:47.320 --> 52:49.595
I accepted I'd never be a father, you know.

52:49.680 --> 52:52.558
But...when we found out that
you could, well...

52:54.000 --> 52:56.230
I suppose it let me dream again, you know?

52:57.160 --> 52:59.116
Create a perfect world.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.796
Have a child with my sister?

53:01.880 --> 53:03.836
No. A bigger family. You know?

53:06.480 --> 53:08.835
I can see that it's not entirely realistic.

53:11.880 --> 53:13.836
Are you disappointed?

53:15.960 --> 53:18.599
That we can only have one child
instead of none?

53:20.080 --> 53:22.036
I couldn't be happier.

53:22.800 --> 53:24.631
I love you.

53:25.360 --> 53:27.032
Both of you.

53:28.680 --> 53:30.636
You and your sister.

53:57.520 --> 54:00.159
What are you doing here?
- Your father sent for me.

54:00.240 --> 54:03.676
I didn't know you were coming.
- Well, I didn't know you were.

54:04.600 --> 54:08.229
It's just as well you did.
I don't want to wind up in a cement mixer.

54:09.440 --> 54:11.396
Despite what you might think...

54:12.440 --> 54:14.192
..I don't do that sort of thing...

54:15.800 --> 54:17.552
..any more.

54:21.200 --> 54:23.156
You've got some good friends.

54:23.240 --> 54:25.435
Have I?
- Yeah.

54:25.520 --> 54:28.193
Friends that are prepared
to go out on a limb for you.

54:28.280 --> 54:31.113
I reckon you can judge a man
by the company he keeps.

54:33.840 --> 54:37.116
If you don't do right by my little girl,
you'll answer to me.

54:38.680 --> 54:40.636
And I lied about the cement mixer.

54:41.400 --> 54:43.709
Dad...we've called the wedding off.

54:44.440 --> 54:47.557
Ah, bollocks!
I'll get my secretary to make a few calls.

54:47.640 --> 54:49.039
No.

54:49.120 --> 54:50.473
What?

54:50.560 --> 54:54.792
You think you can just click your fingers
and make things right. It doesn't work that way.

54:54.880 --> 54:57.189
It usually does for me.

54:58.640 --> 55:00.995
It's not just that we're no longer engaged.

55:01.720 --> 55:03.392
We're not even together.

55:08.960 --> 55:10.234
Jo...

55:12.680 --> 55:14.557
I know that I've hurt you.

55:17.840 --> 55:22.072
And, along with my son, you're the last person
I'd ever want to do that to.

55:23.240 --> 55:26.391
I love you, and I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

55:28.240 --> 55:29.514
So...

55:39.160 --> 55:43.438
Would you do me the greatest honour
of becoming my wife?

55:47.520 --> 55:49.476
Nothing would make me happier.

55:57.760 --> 56:00.513
Save it for the wedding night, will you?
- Sorry.

56:04.040 --> 56:05.996
So why did you ask us to come here?

56:06.080 --> 56:08.355
I wanted to give you your wedding present.

56:09.600 --> 56:13.639
I figured when you come out in the future,
bring the kids to see their grandpa...

56:14.720 --> 56:17.188
I trust I am having grandchildren.

56:18.320 --> 56:20.276
Yeah. One or two.

56:20.360 --> 56:22.794
Wel, you'll need a place to stay
of your own.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.233
And um...

56:25.480 --> 56:27.277
I thought the penthouse.

56:30.560 --> 56:33.028
You're joking! Oh, no!

56:33.720 --> 56:36.075
One of Shawn's better efforts. You take it.

56:36.800 --> 56:38.199
Thank you!

56:38.280 --> 56:40.157
It's all right here!

56:40.240 --> 56:42.196
Lucy's recommendation! Hup!

56:45.160 --> 56:47.116
Aaaaaah!

56:48.000 --> 56:49.592
Right...a toast!

56:49.680 --> 56:51.113
Yeah.
- Oh, yes!

56:51.200 --> 56:52.633
To the Three Amigos!

56:52.720 --> 56:54.676
The Three Degrees!
- The Three Stooges!

56:55.720 --> 56:56.789
You know, boys...

56:56.880 --> 56:58.836
we've had our ups and downs,

56:58.920 --> 57:02.230
but I think that, for us all,
things are really looking up.

57:02.320 --> 57:05.232
Yes!
- Pete's wedding. Adam's baby.

57:05.320 --> 57:07.550
Karen and I...finally on the level.

57:08.280 --> 57:09.918
You know...our women...

57:10.000 --> 57:11.956
The women!
- The girls!

57:13.520 --> 57:15.272
The girls.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.275
Excuse me, would you care to dance?

57:19.000 --> 57:21.116
Um...well, I'm just here with my friends.

57:21.200 --> 57:24.795
No, no! Go on, go on, go on!
- You enjoy yourself, boy!

57:24.880 --> 57:25.835
Ha-ha!

57:27.560 --> 57:30.028
Does he know it's a bloke?
- He hasn't a clue.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.196
Thank you.

57:33.280 --> 57:35.236
It's perfect.

57:35.320 --> 57:37.276
It's just like I imagined.

57:38.280 --> 57:40.236
What are the schools like?

57:41.440 --> 57:46.070
You have a choice. Two within walking distance
and they're both very good schools.

57:46.160 --> 57:48.116
How long a lease are you thinking of?

57:48.200 --> 57:50.156
A year, I expect.

57:50.240 --> 57:52.879
You know, then...then we might
think of buying.

57:59.960 --> 58:01.951
Oh, it's wonderful.

58:10.480 --> 58:12.436
<i>The children are asleep.</i>

58:13.200 --> 58:15.873
Do you fancy a quick dip in the tub
before dinner?

58:23.360 --> 58:24.873
I will.

58:24.960 --> 58:26.439
I love you, too.

58:27.200 --> 58:28.633
OK. Bye.

58:30.120 --> 58:32.270
Mum, calling from Miami to wish me luck.

58:32.360 --> 58:35.716
Yeah, I heard the phone ring.
Something told me not to pick it up.

58:43.200 --> 58:44.155
What?

58:45.200 --> 58:48.875
I hope you're as happy as your mother and I
thought we were going to be.

58:50.680 --> 58:52.636
I hope one day you are, too.

58:56.560 --> 59:00.030
I think it's best if you
make your own way to the wedding.

59:00.120 --> 59:02.190
Really? Right. Got a taxi number?

59:02.280 --> 59:04.236
Yeah, in the kitchen.

59:04.320 --> 59:06.117
Yeah.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.436
You shouldn't be here, you know, Mark.
David'll be back soon.

59:11.520 --> 59:13.476
Karen?

59:14.880 --> 59:16.029
Karen?

59:18.280 --> 59:20.589
I have got some wonderful news!

59:21.880 --> 59:25.190
I know you think I haven't paid you
much attention for the last few days

59:25.280 --> 59:27.919
and now, finally, I can tell you why.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.389
You've been at work, David.
- Yeah.

59:31.640 --> 59:33.596
You love Sydney, don't you?

59:33.680 --> 59:34.999
Well, yeah.

59:35.080 --> 59:37.640
Why don't we move here? Hm?

59:38.680 --> 59:44.312
It gives us a chance for a fresh start, to put
the last dreadful couple of years behind us.

59:44.400 --> 59:46.197
I've planned it all. Listen.

59:46.920 --> 59:50.071
I'm taking over the Sydney office.
I have found us a house.

59:50.160 --> 59:52.913
Although if you don't like it,
we can take another one.

59:53.000 --> 59:56.515
There are excellent schools for Josh,
we'll get a top nanny for the twins,

59:56.600 --> 01:00:01.151
and I'm sure, absolutely sure,
you'll have no difficulty finding work here.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.708
Goodness. Mark, I didn't know you were here.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.074
David.
- Mark.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.958
I've had enough of this. I'm
sick of it. David.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:11.715
Karen and I...we're in love.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.356
She's leaving you, David.

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.873
Karen?

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.556
How fucking dare you?

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.676
David! David! Don't!

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.797
David! Stop it! David! Stop!

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.238
Mark! Get off!

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.673
Get off him!

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.593
Mark! Get off! Get off him!

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.634
Get out! Get out! Get out!
- Now, listen...

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.952
Right. OK.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.756
That's our cab.
- Right.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.476
Are you feeling OK?
- I think so.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.156
I meant Pete.
- Sorry.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.551
Never felt better.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.596
It's just typical of David.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.788
He doesn't stop to consider what
I might want.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.713
He doesn't ask me.
He just ploughs on, regardless.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.552
I thought he'd been working.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:33.269
Yes, so did I, but it's all part of
this plan he's been concocting.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.356
Well, that's wonderful.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.953
What?

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.071
Well, you're the one who's been going on
about the fact that you love it here

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.628
and how you can even see
yourself living here.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.676
David was making that possible.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.275
And all the while you thought he was just
chasing another deal, but...he did it for you.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.552
I think that's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.274
Have you got the rings?
- Of course I've got them.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.352
Bagsy sit in the front seat.
- I think Rachel may want that.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.518
Ohhh! Adam!

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.556
Adam!
- Rachel!

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.392
Ohh! Ooh!

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.948
Rachel, what's wrong?
- What's the matter?

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.996
Call an ambulance!

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.230
No, take the taxi, it'll be quicker!

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.517
Can you walk?
- No! No! I can't!

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.917
No, it's fine. You're OK. Hello! Excuse me.
Can someone help me, please? Nurse!

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.719
Here, sit down. Can you help?
- Get a wheelchair!

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.631
She's bleeding.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.438
Adam, please don't leave me!

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.317
Excuse me. It's just...

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.833
Sorry.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.591
Please... My wife...
- Right.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.318
She's two months...

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.994
She's pregnant. She's not due
for two months. - OK.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.958
She's bleeding all over the place.
- It's OK, darling.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.439
It's OK.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.193
What's your wife's name?
- Rachel Bradley.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.716
Can you get someone? Make them hurry.
- They're on their way.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.112
Can somebody come, please?

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.676
Hi, Pete, sorry, I just...

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.830
Hi. Where have you been?
- Well, I...

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.639
What happened to your lip?
- Um...shaving.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.029
Look, er...Rachel's collapsed.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.190
What?
- Adam's taken her to the hospital.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.236
Is she all right?
- I don't know.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.555
David, will you be my best man?

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.510
Pete, I'll be honoured.
- Oh, thank you.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.433
What do I do?
- You've saved my life.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.159
Rachel, you'll be fine. You'll be fine.
It's OK.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.758
Hi. I'm Dr Moran.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:59.196
Is the pain constant or does it come and go?

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.157
Constant. Worse when you do that.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:04.994
Have you felt the baby move lately?
- Yeah, but not as much as usual.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:09.676
Oh, Jesus! You see, she has this condition...
- Partial Asherman's syndrome.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:13.116
Yeah, we were told she couldn't conceive.
- It's an abruption.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.111
We have to do an emergency Caesarean.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.191
Page the anaesthetist.
- Oh, my God!

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.838
Jesus! What...

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.474
Well, I'd like to welcome you all here today

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.189
on this very special day for
Joanne and Peter.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:03.999
I must say, I'm glad we're having
Australian weather, and not English.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:09.237
Your placenta's come away
from the wall of the uterus.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.390
The baby isn't getting enough oxygen.

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:14.631
I can't tell if it's serious,
but we must try to get the baby out.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.915
No, it's too early. It's not ready.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.230
It's the only option. Prep her for theatre.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.595
What do you mean theatre?
You'll be all right.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.150
Adam, please stay with me.
- You'll be fine. I'm with you.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.276
Peter and Joanne are performing an act
of complete faith, each in the other.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.110
The heart of their marriage and the test of it
will be in the relationship they create.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.997
David?

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.795
Sorry? Yes?
- Do you have the rings?

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.110
Um...
- Er...no.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.836
You know...that isn't funny.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.788
Wait.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:15.028
These circlets of precious metal
are justly regarded

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:20.797
as a fitting emblem for the purity
and the perpetuity of the marriage state...

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.348
I'm really sorry, Adam.
- It's not your fault.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.113
But what if we lose the baby?
- He'll be fine.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.475
This could be our only chance.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.039
I know, I know.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.712
I'm really scared.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.074
I know.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.716
I love you.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.232
I love you, too.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.359
OK, we'll put you under now.
If you could just count backwards from ten.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.158
Ten...

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.708
Nine...
- There you go...

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.552
Eight.
- There you go.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.430
I'm going to have to ask you to leave now.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.911
Joanne Rebecca Ellison,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.515
will you receive Peter Algernon Gifford
as your husband?

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:25.673
Will you pledge him your love,
faith and tenderness,

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.036
cherishing him with a wife's devotion
and loyalty?

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.076
I will.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.876
Peter Algernon Gifford,

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:44.112
will you receive Joanne Rebecca Ellison
as your wife?

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.988
Will you pledge her your love,
faith and tenderness,

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.311
cherishing her
with a husband's loyalty and devotion?

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.711
I will.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:02.155
Insomuch as Peter and Joanne
have declared their love to each other

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.356
before family and friends,

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:08.638
I do now greet them with you
as husband and wife.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.676
You may kiss.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.875
I love you, Dad.
- Oh, baby.

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.551
I love you.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.517
Thank you.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.397
You take care of her, now.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.996
All right, girls. Ready?

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.438
Whoo!

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.877
Bye, everyone!

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:52.837
David.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.638
David?

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.118
No, Karen.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.918
No more.

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.992
Karen...

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.836
<i>He's so tiny.</i>

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.830
I bet he's got massive bollocks.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.556
He's absolutely beautiful.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.595
So the doctors say he's all right?
- Yeah.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.671
He's perfect.

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:45.389
He's got to be kept in for three weeks.
Just to be sure.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.477
Great. You'll still be here
when we get back off honeymoon.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.476
I'll have the beers on ice.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.437
Well, we'll see you then.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.476
Peter, you can count on it.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:10.118
Would you like a drink, Mr Marsden?
Champagne or orange?

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.715
Champagne, thank you.
- You're fortunate. The flight's not full.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.234
So you won't have anyone
sitting next to you.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.276
Yes, I'm very fortunate.
