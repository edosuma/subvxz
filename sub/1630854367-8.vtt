[theme music playing]

00:50.967 --> 00:54.066
[woman sighs wearily]
My feet are killing me,
we need to stop.

00:54.066 --> 00:55.100
[man] Whatever.

00:55.166 --> 00:56.066
What do you mean, whatever?

00:56.066 --> 00:57.100
You're the one
who brought us here.

00:57.166 --> 00:58.567
Yeah, and I'll get us
home, too.

00:58.567 --> 01:00.000
Can you just figure out
where we are, please?

01:00.000 --> 01:00.166
Can you just figure out
where we are, please?

01:00.166 --> 01:01.000
Look, I know exactly where
we're going, just trust me.

01:02.667 --> 01:03.867
I'll get us
where we need to go.

01:04.700 --> 01:05.567
We're lost.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.066
-We're not lost.
-We're lost,

01:08.066 --> 01:09.367
and you need to admit it.

01:09.367 --> 01:10.767
Look, check this out,
all right?

01:11.500 --> 01:14.200
So... [sighs in exasperation]

01:14.266 --> 01:15.300
I know we started here.

01:16.066 --> 01:17.000
Yes.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.367
So, I'm pretty sure we are...

01:21.667 --> 01:22.667
-here!
-Lost!

01:25.066 --> 01:26.166
[woman sighs]

01:28.567 --> 01:29.467
What?

01:34.767 --> 01:37.200
[screams]

01:42.200 --> 01:43.200
[young girl] Dad!

01:48.700 --> 01:50.066
[rapid breathing]

01:57.066 --> 01:59.500
-Dad!
-Yeah, I'm here.

02:01.266 --> 02:02.967
[exhales] It was a bad dream?

02:02.967 --> 02:06.000
-Dad, I was so scared!
-Okay.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.266
[exhales deeply]

02:12.667 --> 02:13.800
[grunts]

02:15.800 --> 02:17.266
How bad was it, hmm?

02:18.467 --> 02:19.800
How bad was it, one to ten?

02:20.266 --> 02:22.166
-Ten.
-Ten?

02:22.166 --> 02:24.100
Oh, that's pretty bad.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.567
Remember what we talked about?

02:26.100 --> 02:27.567
Dreams aren't real.

02:27.567 --> 02:29.767
They scare you,
but they can't hurt you.

02:31.567 --> 02:32.567
[kisses]

02:33.066 --> 02:34.066
Okay?

02:34.700 --> 02:36.100
-Good night.
-No!

02:36.400 --> 02:38.200
Dad, stay.

02:38.266 --> 02:39.600
Please stay here.

02:44.166 --> 02:47.867
So, as long as this line,
right here,

02:47.867 --> 02:49.700
stays connected
to the diver,

02:51.266 --> 02:52.367
he'll never get lost.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.767
You're not scared
in the caves?

02:56.000 --> 02:56.900
Little bit.

02:57.867 --> 03:00.000
But it's good
to be scared sometimes.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.100
But it's good
to be scared sometimes.

03:00.166 --> 03:01.000
Makes you feel like
you can take on anything.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.667
Plus when you're down here,

03:06.600 --> 03:07.700
it's beautiful.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.300
It's like this

03:10.367 --> 03:13.000
amazing place.
You... you get
to see things down there

03:13.000 --> 03:15.667
that no one's
ever seen before, ever.

03:15.667 --> 03:17.066
It's like real-life magic.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.767
You'll see it.
I'll take you down there.

03:20.767 --> 03:23.166
One day.
And you'll love it.

03:23.767 --> 03:25.166
Please don't go tomorrow.

03:25.166 --> 03:26.800
I have a really bad feeling.

03:28.767 --> 03:30.000
Is this your bad dream?

03:30.000 --> 03:30.266
Is this your bad dream?

03:30.266 --> 03:31.000
I don't wanna talk about it.

03:32.867 --> 03:34.467
Well, I'm not
going to the caves tomorrow.

03:34.867 --> 03:35.900
You're not?

03:35.967 --> 03:37.266
Mmm-mmm.

03:37.266 --> 03:38.200
Where are you going?

03:39.700 --> 03:41.100
[Dad] <i>I'm going to the lake.</i>

03:41.100 --> 03:43.100
<i>I'm just gonna try on</i>
<i>some equipment down there.</i>

05:07.367 --> 05:08.800
[inhales deeply]

05:50.100 --> 05:51.166
[young girl] <i>Dad?</i>

05:51.767 --> 05:52.900
Hmm?

05:52.967 --> 05:54.000
Can you read me a story?

05:55.467 --> 05:58.100
No. It's bedtime.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.266
Please...

06:00.700 --> 06:01.000
Mom already did.

06:01.667 --> 06:03.467
But you're way more fun
when you read.

06:03.467 --> 06:06.467
Well, that's true.
That's true, but we're not
gonna tell your mom that.

06:08.667 --> 06:13.467
Okay, fine, fine. Just one.
Pick one, but only one.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.200
Oh...

06:21.266 --> 06:23.100
-Good choice.
This is your new one, right?
-Yep.

06:24.066 --> 06:26.700
[inhaling] Okay.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000

"Take a deep breath."

06:30.000 --> 06:30.200

You think he's gonna make it?

10:59.266 --> 11:00.967
Well...

11:00.967 --> 11:02.767
Still plenty
of pages left, so...

11:03.800 --> 11:05.367
I think we're good.

11:05.367 --> 11:06.015
But what if he lets go?

11:06.015 --> 11:07.000
But what if he lets go?

11:08.567 --> 11:09.767
What do you mean?

11:09.767 --> 11:14.066
Like, what if he just lets go?

11:14.066 --> 11:16.467
He can't hang there forever,
could he?

11:16.467 --> 11:18.000
What, he just gives up?

11:18.066 --> 11:19.500
Yeah, like...

11:19.567 --> 11:22.900
What if he just does that?
Then it's over, right?

11:23.767 --> 11:25.467
[inhales, exhales deeply]

11:25.467 --> 11:27.266
Well, he would probably...

11:29.567 --> 11:31.266
I think he's gonna make it.

11:31.266 --> 11:32.767
-You do?
-Oh, yeah.

11:33.767 --> 11:35.467
You see
this little raccoon here?

11:36.100 --> 11:37.000
He lost his parents, right?

11:38.867 --> 11:44.266
So, he's gonna do
whatever it takes
to find them.

11:44.266 --> 11:46.200
Because he needs them.

11:46.266 --> 11:48.567
Just like you and me.
We need each other.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.467
But what if...

11:52.867 --> 11:54.300
If he never does?

11:55.100 --> 11:56.667
And... [sniffles]

11:57.600 --> 11:59.867
[voice breaking]
He's all alone.

12:03.100 --> 12:05.200
I'm not gonna
be alone, right?

12:06.667 --> 12:07.000
You won't ever
have to think about
that for a very long time.

12:11.767 --> 12:13.200
[sniffling]

12:14.367 --> 12:16.467
I'm done
with this stupid book.

12:16.467 --> 12:19.667
-I wanna read something else.
-Hey, hey, hey.

12:19.667 --> 12:22.100
Let's go
find out what happens?

12:22.166 --> 12:25.900
Huh? Your little
raccoon friend,
he's hanging there, look.

12:25.967 --> 12:28.166
He's hanging there
with his little paws.

12:28.166 --> 12:30.166
-His little baby fur paws.
-[chuckles]

12:30.166 --> 12:32.200
-Baby fur paws.
-[laughs]

12:33.567 --> 12:34.600
[Dad sighs]

12:36.800 --> 12:37.000
Sometimes in life,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.367
you just get problems
that you don't see coming.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.000
But you face them...

12:45.800 --> 12:47.867
You face them
and you persevere.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.100
That's what he's trying to do.

12:50.667 --> 12:51.867
He's trying to persevere.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.400
I guess.
But what happens to him?

12:57.100 --> 12:58.200
Well, let's find out.

Hey, it was just getting good.

20:35.367 --> 20:37.767
I don't think you're gonna
like where this is going.

20:37.767 --> 20:39.567
You want
to keep reading it, Dad.

20:39.567 --> 20:42.767
Not all fairy tales
have the happiest endings.

20:42.767 --> 20:45.166
Yes, they do. They always do.

20:46.700 --> 20:49.300
Remember that book
I read you, last week,

20:49.367 --> 20:51.200
um, <i>Hansel and Gretel?</i>

20:51.266 --> 20:53.000
The one with
the old witch in the house?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.166
Mmm-hmm.
Well, in the original story,

20:55.166 --> 20:56.667
they never left the house.

20:57.367 --> 20:58.500
What happened to them?

20:59.400 --> 21:01.096
The witch bakes them
into pies,

21:01.096 --> 21:02.000
The witch bakes them
into pies,

21:02.767 --> 21:03.867
and then you know
what she does?

21:03.867 --> 21:05.600
She took them and she...

21:05.667 --> 21:07.100
-Ate them?
-Ate them.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.567
Yeah, mmm-hmm.

21:08.567 --> 21:10.800
-That's scary.
-Yeah, I know.

21:10.867 --> 21:12.567
See, they would write
these scary endings

21:12.567 --> 21:15.500
to... frighten the kids

21:15.567 --> 21:17.100
and hopefully
teach them some lessons.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.700
Like a school?

21:19.767 --> 21:22.500
Like, don't talk to strangers

21:22.567 --> 21:25.066
and always listen
to your parents.

21:25.066 --> 21:27.166
Do adults learn
from them, too?

21:28.367 --> 21:29.467
What's that supposed to mean?

21:30.467 --> 21:31.096
All right, that's
enough for tonight.

21:31.096 --> 21:32.000
All right, that's
enough for tonight.

21:32.567 --> 21:33.667
We'll finish tomorrow.

21:34.100 --> 21:35.033
It's bedtime.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.900
Can you stay with me
till I fall asleep?

21:38.700 --> 21:39.800
[exhales]

No.

25:33.767 --> 25:35.166
I don't want another story.

25:37.367 --> 25:39.767
Let me tell you a story.

25:39.767 --> 25:42.200
My dream, I saw you.

25:42.266 --> 25:46.100
In a strange room,
a room that could change
its shape.

25:46.166 --> 25:48.800
You stood there for so long,

25:48.867 --> 25:52.300
for so long,
you didn't know what to do.

25:52.367 --> 25:54.667
I couldn't do
anything to help.

25:54.667 --> 25:57.000
I could see the door
for you to leave,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.266
but I couldn't
tell you where it was.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.096
And every time you turned
to see that door,
it was gone.

26:01.096 --> 26:02.000
And every time you turned
to see that door,
it was gone.

26:03.767 --> 26:06.867
I could see on your face
that you were so scared.

26:06.867 --> 26:09.667
Then I watched
the room get smaller--

26:09.667 --> 26:12.166
-Honey, honey, honey.
-Shh.

26:14.567 --> 26:16.200
Look at me.

26:16.266 --> 26:19.000
I can't because I don't
want you to see it.

26:19.567 --> 26:20.567
See what?

26:22.066 --> 26:23.166
To see...

26:27.400 --> 26:28.467
[young girl] Ouch!

26:29.567 --> 26:31.096
Okay, look at me, look at me.

<i>Bye, Dad.</i>

34:00.667 --> 34:01.767
Bye, hon.

34:24.500 --> 34:28.400
All right. That was
"The scuba diver in the tree."

34:28.467 --> 34:30.934
One of my favorite,
favorite, urban legends.

34:30.934 --> 34:33.333
It's just
so completely insane,

34:33.333 --> 34:35.767
and I'm now joined
by the director, Mike Gallant.

34:35.834 --> 34:37.867
-Mike, welcome.
-Thank you for having me.

34:37.934 --> 34:41.467
All right. So,
there was a big discussion
about this episode.

34:41.467 --> 34:45.166
And a lot of people told me
it was unfilmable,

34:45.166 --> 34:46.266
or too crazy,

34:46.333 --> 34:48.233
or, "How you're gonna
pull this off?"

34:48.233 --> 34:48.656
And of course,
the answer is,
"I don't have to.

34:48.656 --> 34:49.000
And of course,
the answer is,
"I don't have to.

34:51.166 --> 34:52.767
The director has to," but I...

34:52.834 --> 34:55.367
I fought so hard
for this episode,

34:55.367 --> 34:58.000
um, because it's one of those
urban legends

34:58.000 --> 35:01.133
I just wanted to see rendered.

35:01.133 --> 35:03.967
Tell me about
what excites you about it

35:03.967 --> 35:05.934
and what's your approach?

35:05.934 --> 35:07.266
Like, how were you gonna
pull this off?

35:07.333 --> 35:09.266
So, I'm actually
in agreement with you

35:09.266 --> 35:12.867
in terms of the excitement
around the scuba diver myth.

35:12.934 --> 35:15.467
As soon as I was told
that's what we were doing,

35:15.467 --> 35:17.066
I was very excited because

35:17.066 --> 35:18.656
we would make it a lot more
about the scuba diver himself

35:18.656 --> 35:19.000
we would make it a lot more
about the scuba diver himself

35:19.767 --> 35:22.233
and we put our own
spin on it, whereas,

35:22.233 --> 35:24.767
"Okay, he didn't die
from the fall.

35:24.834 --> 35:28.166
He's actually in the forest,
in the fire

35:28.166 --> 35:30.767
and he's using
his own oxygen tank,"

35:30.767 --> 35:33.967
which makes sense
obviously being a scuba diver,

35:33.967 --> 35:36.333
to keep himself alive
for as long as possible.

35:36.333 --> 35:38.600
When I saw
that we were taking
that approach to it,

35:38.667 --> 35:43.133
I got really excited
because this sort of
became a survival, uh, story.

35:43.133 --> 35:47.033
But overall I just find that
the scuba diver myth itself

35:47.033 --> 35:48.656
is just a really, really
great urban legend.

35:48.656 --> 35:49.000
is just a really, really
great urban legend.

35:49.667 --> 35:52.867
Is it true?
Did it really happen?
Did it not happen?

35:52.867 --> 35:54.166
Could it happen? [laughs]

35:54.233 --> 35:55.567
Yeah, it's... It is...

35:55.567 --> 35:57.734
Well, the best urban legends
live in that zone,

35:57.734 --> 35:58.767
-where it's so absurd...
-Yes.

35:58.834 --> 36:00.166
...that you'd think,
"Well, that could happen.

36:00.166 --> 36:02.500
-That is a freak acc...
Freak accidents happen."
-Yeah.

36:02.567 --> 36:04.667
"The Scuba Diver,"
what I liked
about the episode

36:04.667 --> 36:08.266
is that anytime you have
kind of the velociraptor
in the kitchen,

36:08.333 --> 36:10.166
you know, something
completely out of context

36:10.166 --> 36:11.467
-in the wrong place...
-Right.

36:11.467 --> 36:13.266
...it's instantly unsettling.

36:13.333 --> 36:16.967
If you're in a forest fire,
the oxygen tank,
if it doesn't explode,

36:16.967 --> 36:18.333
-is the thing that's gonna
save your life.
-Yeah.

36:18.333 --> 36:18.656
But now you gotta
walk around in this wet suit.

36:18.656 --> 36:19.000
But now you gotta
walk around in this wet suit.

36:20.734 --> 36:21.967
What do you do
if it's burned

36:21.967 --> 36:23.667
-and sticking to your skin?
-Yeah.

36:23.667 --> 36:26.467
I mean, it's literally
a contained horror film.

36:26.467 --> 36:30.000
What I love about this episode
and this story in particular

36:30.000 --> 36:33.400
is that it falls in
that category of pure cinema.

36:33.467 --> 36:36.066
No, dialogue,
just camera work.

36:36.066 --> 36:38.133
There's no talking.
It's all, like, a kinet...

36:38.133 --> 36:41.166
And in this case
it will be some
kinetic, visceral cinema.

36:41.233 --> 36:42.500
Talk about
that kind of approach,

36:42.567 --> 36:43.634
where you're
shooting the scene

36:43.634 --> 36:45.667
that, you know, other than
the father and daughter,

36:45.734 --> 36:47.266
there's not a lot of dialogue.

36:47.333 --> 36:48.656
Yeah, so you
have to definitely get
a very strong performer.

36:48.656 --> 36:49.000
Yeah, so you
have to definitely get
a very strong performer.

36:50.367 --> 36:52.500
That's directing 101,
I guess you'd say,

36:52.567 --> 36:55.066
and fortunately
we have someone really great,

36:55.066 --> 36:57.100
Nick Smyth, uh,
who is carrying

36:57.100 --> 36:58.867
this whole thing
sort of on his shoulders.

36:58.934 --> 37:01.066
I told him, I was like,
"This is gonna be rough.

37:01.066 --> 37:03.033
This is gonna be hard.
You're, you know,

37:03.033 --> 37:05.367
you're gonna
get your ass kicked
for about four days."

37:05.367 --> 37:07.934
-And he's in a scuba suit.
-Yes, on top of that, and--

37:07.934 --> 37:11.066
I mean, I went outside
in a T-shirt at 100 degrees
and I was hot.

37:11.066 --> 37:14.100
Being in a scuba suit,
you know, walking
and doing the shot

37:14.100 --> 37:16.066
-of someone with flippers...
-Right.

37:16.066 --> 37:18.467
-...trying to...
It's such an absurd image.
-Yeah.

37:18.467 --> 37:18.656
And I think that
the best urban legends

37:18.656 --> 37:19.000
And I think that
the best urban legends

37:20.767 --> 37:23.567
-weirdly have an element
of absurdity to them.
-Right.

37:23.567 --> 37:26.567
You're like, "That's so crazy.
How could that ever happen?"

37:27.100 --> 37:28.367
But it did happen.

37:28.367 --> 37:29.500
Because someone you know

37:29.567 --> 37:30.867
-knew someone
who knew someone...
-Right.

37:30.934 --> 37:32.266
...that swore
that it happened.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.033
That's the thing
about this myth,

37:34.033 --> 37:36.600
um, I would say
even more so than,

37:36.667 --> 37:38.500
uh, all the other ones
in my opinion,

37:38.567 --> 37:40.667
my humble opinion, is that

37:40.734 --> 37:43.000
everyone swears
this has happened,

37:43.000 --> 37:46.266
you know, California
or France were
these big locations.

37:46.266 --> 37:47.767
It happened in the '80s.

37:47.767 --> 37:48.656
Somebody swears by it.

37:48.656 --> 37:49.000
Somebody swears by it.

38:05.667 --> 38:07.266
Planning a shoot like this,

38:07.333 --> 38:08.867
how much is practical fire?

38:08.867 --> 38:10.166
What can you do
with a flame bar?

38:10.233 --> 38:11.867
What are you doing
with LED screens?

38:11.867 --> 38:12.967
What's CGI?

38:12.967 --> 38:14.600
How do you break
that down in your head?

38:14.667 --> 38:17.166
And as a director,
what do you like to use?

38:17.233 --> 38:18.467
Right. Well,

38:18.467 --> 38:18.656
in terms of the locations
that we were...

38:18.656 --> 38:19.000
in terms of the locations
that we were...

38:20.767 --> 38:22.033
They're very fickle about

38:22.033 --> 38:24.767
just how much
we are able
to bring fire into it,

38:24.767 --> 38:26.834
understandably
in the middle of the summer.

38:26.834 --> 38:29.767
Um, so we're using
a lot of visual effects

38:29.834 --> 38:32.033
to portray the fire itself,

38:32.033 --> 38:35.367
-but we're using
a lot of smoke machines.
-Mmm-hmm.

38:35.367 --> 38:40.266
-Um, and our great DOP
has flickering LEDs that...
-Mmm-hmm.

38:40.266 --> 38:42.567
Not just LEDs
but bigger lights than that

38:42.567 --> 38:46.166
that we're sort of lining
our whole forest set with,

38:46.233 --> 38:48.656
so that it's constantly
flickering on the scuba diver
as he's going.

38:48.656 --> 38:49.000
so that it's constantly
flickering on the scuba diver
as he's going.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.166
And we were having
a lot of conversations,

38:52.166 --> 38:55.367
and, you know,
finding the best angles
and everything to utilize

38:55.367 --> 38:58.066
and just make it as believable
as humanly possible.

39:16.767 --> 39:18.400
[inhaling]

39:23.400 --> 39:26.667
I was going through
a lot of different films
for references for this.

39:26.734 --> 39:30.834
And obviously nowadays
they play it a lot more safe
and lot of CG fire,

39:30.834 --> 39:32.367
which is completely
understandable.

39:32.367 --> 39:35.166
But when, you know,
you think about stuff that

39:35.233 --> 39:37.400
performers such as
yourself go through

39:37.467 --> 39:40.166
because you
had to deal with
Tarantino's wall of fire

39:40.233 --> 39:41.734
while you were shooting
<i>Inglourious Basterds,</i>

39:41.734 --> 39:42.934
-and--
-I almost died.

39:42.934 --> 39:44.100
-Yeah.
-Crazy.

39:44.100 --> 39:46.066
-Not on purpose, but...
-Of course. Of course.

39:46.066 --> 39:47.934
...if the fire
got much closer.

39:47.934 --> 39:48.656
They'd done,
like, a bunch of tests,

39:48.656 --> 39:49.000
They'd done,
like, a bunch of tests,

39:49.467 --> 39:51.367
but they never tested
the fire with the flags
on the scene.

39:51.367 --> 39:54.567
But even on camera
when you see
how close you are...

39:54.567 --> 39:56.033
-Yeah.
-...to that wall of fire,

39:56.033 --> 39:58.266
you know, it just...
It makes you unnerved.

39:58.266 --> 39:59.667
I had no frame of reference

39:59.667 --> 40:02.266
for what
that level of pain was.

40:02.266 --> 40:04.400
'Cause it... They... It was...
They said, "It won't get

40:04.467 --> 40:06.567
closer than 20 feet,"
and it was right up over us

40:06.567 --> 40:08.166
and I couldn't gel my hands...

40:08.166 --> 40:10.500
Yeah, that's the thing, right,
you didn't have protection.

40:10.567 --> 40:11.834
-My hands were
so burned and...
-Right.

40:11.834 --> 40:12.934
I passed out after it.

40:12.967 --> 40:14.834
They said another...
It was... It was multiplying.

40:14.834 --> 40:17.166
You see a swastika
fall in the film.

40:17.233 --> 40:18.567
That wasn't
supposed to happen.

40:18.567 --> 40:18.656
-Oh, okay.
-The steel liquified.
It was 2,000 degrees.

40:18.656 --> 40:19.000
-Oh, okay.
-The steel liquified.
It was 2,000 degrees.

40:20.934 --> 40:22.500
They said that
another 30 seconds,

40:22.567 --> 40:25.100
the structure we're on
would have collapsed.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.166
So, Mike, tell us,
uh, just a bit about,

40:27.166 --> 40:29.000
for people
that aren't familiar
with your work,

40:29.000 --> 40:31.367
that are gonna
see this episode
for the first time,

40:31.367 --> 40:33.066
tell us a little bit
about yourself,

40:33.066 --> 40:34.767
where you started,
what you're doing,

40:34.834 --> 40:36.734
other work of yours
that they could see,

40:36.734 --> 40:37.967
where they
can find your stuff.

40:37.967 --> 40:40.767
So, I've... I've actually
worked a lot as an editor

40:40.834 --> 40:43.266
so I've, uh, edited
a lot of feature films

40:43.266 --> 40:45.266
and many
horror films, actually,

40:45.333 --> 40:48.000
so that's sort of how
I got into the whole thing.

40:48.000 --> 40:48.656
How did all
those years of editing

40:48.656 --> 40:49.000
How did all
those years of editing

40:49.767 --> 40:51.567
prepare you for directing?

40:51.567 --> 40:55.100
I think literally editing
is probably one of the best

40:55.100 --> 40:57.734
ways to learn
how to direct, personally.

40:57.734 --> 41:00.600
Uh, even writing, too,
because you see
all the mistakes.

41:00.667 --> 41:03.000
And then you see
how you have to fix it.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.667
You know immediately
if you're shooting something,

41:05.667 --> 41:07.233
"All right, that's not
gonna make the cut.

41:07.233 --> 41:08.233
That's not gonna work."

41:08.233 --> 41:09.834
We don't have
the reverse of that.

41:09.834 --> 41:12.667
I need a transition from
this scene to this scene."

41:12.667 --> 41:17.600
As an editor now directing,
do you pre-edit a scene
before you go shoot it?

41:17.667 --> 41:18.656
Do you, like, play it
in your head going,

41:18.656 --> 41:19.000
Do you, like, play it
in your head going,

41:19.333 --> 41:20.467
"I need that,
that, that, that"?

41:20.467 --> 41:21.934
Or you're doing that
while you're cutting?

41:21.934 --> 41:24.467
I believe when I sort of
make my shot list initially,

41:24.467 --> 41:26.233
that's sort of where
my head is at.

41:26.233 --> 41:27.567
When I'm on set, I try

41:27.567 --> 41:29.600
and just sort of live more
in the moment

41:29.667 --> 41:32.600
and just make sure that
the performances

41:32.667 --> 41:35.667
are getting out.
Like, I really
care a lot about performances.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.367
So, where can people
follow you?

41:37.367 --> 41:39.834
Yes, so I'm on Instagram,

41:39.834 --> 41:43.000
Helix Reel, R-E-E-L, Ent.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.233
-I'm very, very easily,
uh, Google-able. [laughs]
-Awesome.

41:46.233 --> 41:47.333
Easy to find on Google.

41:47.367 --> 41:48.656
No, I want
people to watch this
and check you out

41:48.656 --> 41:49.000
No, I want
people to watch this
and check you out

41:49.934 --> 41:51.867
and follow you
and see your other works.

41:51.867 --> 41:52.834
I really appreciate that.

41:52.834 --> 41:53.834
I think your stuff
is really fantastic.

41:53.834 --> 41:54.734
Thanks, man,
I appreciate that.

41:54.734 --> 41:55.867
Great job, man.

41:55.867 --> 41:57.233
It was, uh, really a pleasure
to sit down with you.
