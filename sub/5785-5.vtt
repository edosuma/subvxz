I ﬁght crime and ﬁnd
other meta-humans like me.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.596
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother, but in doing so,

00:19.770 --> 00:22.022
I opened up our world to new threats.

So, let me get this straight.

03:46.060 --> 03:49.678
You're the doppelganger
of the man who murdered his mom

03:49.897 --> 03:53.310
and is responsible for both
Ronnie and Eddie's deaths.

03:53.484 --> 03:56.146
Yeah, but he's not even the doppelganger
of the Dr. Wells that we knew,

03:56.320 --> 03:58.857
because that Dr. Wells' body
had been taken over by the Reverse-Flash

03:59.073 --> 04:04.033
who was really Eobard Thawne. and
Eddie's distant relative from the future.

04:05.371 --> 04:07.032
Yeah, I didn't follow any of that.
I'm my own man.

04:07.206 --> 04:09.743

of your mother, or your friend Ricky.

-Him either.

Why are we even listening to him?

04:33.274 --> 04:34.889
How do we know he's not evil,
like the other guy?

04:35.109 --> 04:36.599

04:36.861 --> 04:38.226
The question is why.

04:38.446 --> 04:41.438

05:29.413 --> 05:33.406

He will never allow there to be
another speedster in the multi-verse.

sending these metas here,

but that guy. back in that room,
that's not Wells.

06:45.114 --> 06:48.402
Dr. McGee swore she saw Wells.
He broke into Mercury Labs.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.118
What? Why didn't you tell me this?

06:50.327 --> 06:53.160
Because I didn't believe her. I didn't
even want to consider Wells was alive.

06:53.372 --> 06:57.411
Eddie erased that Wells from existence.
This guy is...

06:57.626 --> 07:01.585
He's someone else. And he says
he's here to help us stop Zoom.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.753
-How can you even look at him?
-You think this is easy for me?

07:03.966 --> 07:06.582
The guy in there looks, moves. sounds

07:06.802 --> 07:08.963
exactly like the guy that drove a knife
through my mother's heart.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.635
I have to resist the urge to kill him.

07:11.807 --> 07:16.176
I'm trying my best to get past that, okay?
You shooting him, that's not helping.

07:16.478 --> 07:20.312

I thought at least we were free of Wells.

if you'd just stopped Light

How could she possibly do that?

19:01.474 --> 19:04.932
Because Light looks exactly
like my ex-girlfriend. Linda Park.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.182
That's why Zoom sent her.
Because he knew you'd hesitate.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.523
Well, that means Zoom had to have known,
somehow, that Linda was your ex?

19:11.735 --> 19:13.225
Which is why Bany has to act now,

19:13.445 --> 19:15.356
before Zoom sends another double
from Bany's life.

Why don't you choose?

23:27.615 --> 23:28.650
So, I don't mean to pry,

23:30.201 --> 23:34.240
but when Wells keeps referring
to you and Zoom, what's he talking about?

23:34.455 --> 23:37.913
I've fought Zoom many times,
each time barely escaping with my life.

23:40.003 --> 23:44.087
(SIGHS) So, yeah. Maybe I didn't always
confront him when I should have.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.709
The truth is, Zoom scared me.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.382
He stole the most precious thing from me.
my speed.

23:49.804 --> 23:51.920
I didn't want Bany
to suffer the same fate.

23:52.140 --> 23:55.098
Well, maybe if you just sat down
with Wells, talk to him about it?

23:55.310 --> 23:57.517
No, no, no. Do not trust Wells. Caitlin.

and not just because I disappeared.

to be struck by lightning?

24:28.843 --> 24:32.210
It was an intensity I'd never felt.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.921
Like I was instantly connected
to everything around me.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.678
Then I woke up ﬁom a coma
nine months later.

24:38.019 --> 24:42.262

it's like time travel.

I actually drowned.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.646
I hit my head on the diving board
and fell into the swimming pool.

24:51.866 --> 24:55.154
Uh, my heart stopped for,
I think, two minutes

24:55.370 --> 24:59.158
until my dad rescued me
and saved my life. Yeah.

24:59.374 --> 25:02.787

25:04.003 --> 25:05.664

25:05.880 --> 25:07.996
that taught me
not to be afraid of anything.

25:08.216 --> 25:11.049

from being who they should be.

35:33.173 --> 35:34.959
She should be wearing a black trench coat.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.221
Why won't you just let me leave?

35:47.438 --> 35:49.850
I can't let you leave.
You killed an innocent man.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.186
Trying to kill Linda Park wasn't.

35:53.402 --> 35:57.020
It's the only way that I can be free
from Zoom. Unless I kill you.

35:57.239 --> 36:00.197
Can't let you do that, either.
So, we've got a problem.

36:00.409 --> 36:01.865
mum

36:02.578 --> 36:05.365
Guys? Should've talked about this
before I left, but how should I stop her?

36:05.581 --> 36:08.448
Keep trying different angles, Bany.
Find her blind spot.

36:08.751 --> 36:09.786
(GROANS)

36:13.005 --> 36:14.745
I can't get close enough.
What should I do?

36:15.758 --> 36:16.918
I don't know.

36:17.134 --> 36:20.171
BARRY: Oh, Igotta tell you, that's not
exactly the answer! was looking for.

36:20.888 --> 36:23.174
You need to confuse her.
Give her more than one target

36:23.390 --> 36:25.005
so she does not know who to ﬁre at.

36:25.225 --> 36:26.476
All right. How do I do that?

36:26.685 --> 36:29.722
By running so fast. you create
multiple afterimages of yourself.

36:29.938 --> 36:32.145
You create a speed mirage.

36:35.736 --> 36:37.897
Well, from what I've been told.
you've traveled through time.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.978
You'll be more than fast enough.

36:40.491 --> 36:41.526
Okay.

37:01.470 --> 37:04.678
Yes. you can, Bany.
Hey, Dr. Wells is right. You are fast.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.176
Faster than I ever was,
and better than I ever will be.

37:07.393 --> 37:09.634

37:43.011 --> 37:46.674

You can't be serious.

37:56.692 --> 37:59.229
More breachers are gonna come.
More innocent people may die.

37:59.445 --> 38:01.356
I can't let this happen anymore.

38:01.572 --> 38:03.403
Well, you're making a mistake, okay?

38:03.615 --> 38:06.482
Zoom is a nightmare
you can't wake up from.

38:06.702 --> 38:10.365
I've already had my worst nightmare.
His name was Reverse-Flash.

38:10.581 --> 38:12.993
I spent a long time being aﬁaid of him.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.666
I'm not gonna be afraid anymore.

38:15.919 --> 38:19.832
(CHUCKLES) Okay, Bany,
you may be faster than me.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.175
but you're not ready
to ﬁght Zoom by yourself.

38:22.384 --> 38:23.840
That's just it, Jay.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.667
I'm not gonna ﬁght him by myself.

38:25.888 --> 38:28.755
I've got all of them to help me.
I've got Dr. Wells,

38:30.476 --> 38:31.591
I've got you.

38:34.563 --> 38:37.100
No. I can't in good conscience
help you when I know

38:37.316 --> 38:41.275
it'll only lead to you losing your speed
or even worse,

38:41.487 --> 38:42.943
your death.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.191
Optimism must be an Earth-1 thing.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.775
You all need to ask yourself
why this man. for years,

38:49.995 --> 38:51.826
wouldn't admit that he was responsible

38:52.039 --> 38:54.496
for the particle accelerator
exploding underground.

38:54.708 --> 38:57.825
He may not be
Harrison Wells from your Earth,

38:58.128 --> 39:00.790
but he has just as many secrets
as the one you knew.

39:04.218 --> 39:06.083
Jay, please don't go.

39:08.472 --> 39:10.053
I'm so sony, Caitlin.

39:18.857 --> 39:22.145
Have a nice day. What can I get you.

39:22.361 --> 39:25.444
Yeah, I know, this is supes awkward.
Probably, more for me than for you.

39:25.656 --> 39:28.363
But I just want coffee. Okay?

39:28.575 --> 39:31.282
Just three Flashes.
One of them decaf. That's it.

39:33.789 --> 39:34.949

39:36.083 --> 39:39.075
Are you sure that's all you want?

39:39.294 --> 39:41.330
Oh, that's funny. You just want to
shoot me down again, huh?

39:41.588 --> 39:43.374
No. No, no, no. (CHUCKLES)

39:44.466 --> 39:48.425
What I mean is,
I just moved to Central City.

39:48.971 --> 39:51.383
And it's a pretty big change
from where I come from.

39:51.598 --> 39:55.807
Everything here's so big and new,
and ﬁlled with meta-humans.

39:56.103 --> 39:59.140
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. Well, when you factor in
the size of the city,

39:59.356 --> 40:02.598
the chances of running into a meta-human
are actually pretty low.

40:03.652 --> 40:06.189
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

40:06.405 --> 40:08.987
you kinda caught me
off guard the other day.

40:09.199 --> 40:11.690
But now, I'm a little more prepared.

40:11.910 --> 40:15.823
So I just want to make sure,
is coffee all you want?

40:17.958 --> 40:18.993

40:19.626 --> 40:21.833
Hi. I'm Cisco Ramon.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.336

40:26.341 --> 40:28.923
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Ijust...

40:29.136 --> 40:32.048
I was getting used to Jay
being part of the team.

40:32.264 --> 40:34.425
Well, look, Jay is a hero.

40:34.641 --> 40:36.552
They always seem to show up
just when you need 'em.

40:37.978 --> 40:39.218
-Yo.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

40:39.855 --> 40:41.265
Peep that.

40:41.565 --> 40:43.772
-That's how it's done, young Padawan.
-Wow. Nice.

40:43.984 --> 40:45.019
We're going on a date next week.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.694
Things are looking up for Cisco Ramon.

40:46.903 --> 40:49.610
I guess so.
Still stuck with these powers. though.

40:49.823 --> 40:51.233
I just don't know how to feel about them.

40:51.450 --> 40:54.192
Hey, look, you don't gotta
go through it alone.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.486
And now you need a cool name.

40:57.706 --> 41:00.288
Oh, snap. You're totally right.

41:01.043 --> 41:04.581
Oh, I gotta think about this one.
Well, you know me. It's gotta be perfect.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.832
-Mmm-hmm.
-Something that really sings, you know.

41:07.049 --> 41:08.539
