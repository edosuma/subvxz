WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:11.379 --> 00:12.344
<i>Now on a clear day-</i>

00:12.448 --> 00:13.862
you can see
for miles.

00:13.965 --> 00:15.827
Oh you must see
the living room.

00:15.931 --> 00:17.034
I'm told that actually-

00:17.137 --> 00:18.965
<i>the sellers imported this
built-in marble credenza</i>

00:19.068 --> 00:19.724
<i>from Napoli.</i>

00:19.827 --> 00:20.413
It's just-

00:30.206 --> 00:31.034
Hi.

00:36.206 --> 00:37.517
Take care of her.

00:58.862 --> 00:59.482
Male robber: <i>Come on!</i>

00:59.586 --> 01:00.344
<i>Time's up!</i>

01:00.448 --> 01:01.172
<i>Hurry!</i>

01:13.103 --> 01:14.206
Hey Joe!

01:14.310 --> 01:16.413
<i>Possible robbery
reported on the east side.</i>

01:16.517 --> 01:17.758
<i>You're my closest officer.</i>

01:17.862 --> 01:19.379
Okay, Rex
and I are on it.

01:19.482 --> 01:20.379
Send me the address.

01:20.482 --> 01:21.413
Hang on pal.

01:21.517 --> 01:23.827
<i>8989 Red Robin Road.</i>

01:23.931 --> 01:26.068
<i>A neighbour saw two
suspects exit the house.</i>

01:26.172 --> 01:28.172
<i>Okay, you got it.</i>

01:45.896 --> 01:46.758
Rex.

02:15.551 --> 02:16.275
SJPD!

02:17.482 --> 02:18.551
Turn around.

02:20.413 --> 02:21.275
<i>Turn around!</i>

02:37.965 --> 02:39.000
Thanks for the detailed
suspect descriptions.

02:39.103 --> 02:41.137
I'll make sure my team
gets the information.

02:41.241 --> 02:42.551
I thought criminals
robbed banks!

02:42.655 --> 02:44.137
Who robs an
open house?

02:44.241 --> 02:45.482
Well, a different
kind of criminal.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.068
Viewings were by
appointment only?

02:48.172 --> 02:49.241
Yes.

02:49.344 --> 02:50.965
But they were already
here when I got here at 10.

02:51.068 --> 02:54.310
You said that they asked to
see the primary bedroom first?

02:55.586 --> 02:56.896
Yes, they-

02:57.000 --> 03:00.103
They checked
every drawer, closets.

03:00.206 --> 03:02.000
Gosh, I wasn't even thinking
they were casing the joint.

03:02.862 --> 03:04.206
Lots of clients snoop!

03:04.310 --> 03:06.482
What happened after
your next client arrived?

03:06.586 --> 03:08.344
They headed
out that door.

03:08.448 --> 03:09.655
And then you
two found me.

03:09.758 --> 03:11.965
On the rope that you
were tied up with-

03:12.068 --> 03:13.758
the knot on it looked
almost nautical.

03:13.862 --> 03:16.344
They didn't seem
like boaters to me.

03:17.724 --> 03:18.827
The property have
any surveillance?

03:18.931 --> 03:19.724
Yeah!

03:20.034 --> 03:20.793
<i>It's state
of the art.</i>

03:20.896 --> 03:22.482
<i>But the owners
turned it off.</i>

03:22.586 --> 03:24.724
Didn't want their
phone pinging all day.

03:25.275 --> 03:26.137
Oh.

03:26.931 --> 03:28.206
Who is going to tell
them what happened?

03:28.310 --> 03:29.241
We can handle that.

03:29.344 --> 03:30.448
Why don't you
just have a seat?

03:30.551 --> 03:32.206
And I'll let you know if
there's any more questions.

03:32.310 --> 03:33.413
<i>Okay.</i>

03:34.862 --> 03:36.517
<i>Hey.</i>

03:36.620 --> 03:37.689
Hey!

03:37.793 --> 03:39.551
I'll process the
rope for prints-

03:39.655 --> 03:42.724
after I do a sweep
of this house.

03:42.827 --> 03:43.655
This house is stunning.

03:43.758 --> 03:45.896
Yeah I bet the
property taxes are too.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.344
The realtor said that
the robbers wore gloves.

03:48.448 --> 03:50.137
Huh, so they
were meticulous.

03:50.241 --> 03:51.068
Meticulous yeah.

03:51.172 --> 03:52.000
Greedy no.

03:52.103 --> 03:53.482
They left a lot of
expensive stuff.

03:53.586 --> 03:55.448
Just took what
they could carry.

03:55.551 --> 03:56.379
Why, what are
you thinking?

03:56.482 --> 03:58.517
This was about
a fast score.

03:58.620 --> 04:00.103
Not a big one.

04:00.793 --> 04:02.965
Well they used something
heavy duty to cut through this.

04:03.068 --> 04:05.000
Odd serrations there.

04:06.000 --> 04:06.827
Rex.

04:06.931 --> 04:07.586
Come here.

04:22.551 --> 04:23.758
Good job, Rex.

04:33.241 --> 04:34.862
This is how the robbers
got in and out.

04:34.965 --> 04:36.758
The back yard
provided cover.

04:37.862 --> 04:38.517
<i>Looks like they-</i>

04:39.103 --> 04:41.620
<i>cut the keypad.</i>

04:42.689 --> 04:43.758
Oh yeah.

04:43.862 --> 04:45.689
I'd say blowtorched.

04:46.793 --> 04:49.379
But judging by the
way this metal looks-

04:49.482 --> 04:50.344
this wasn't done today.

04:52.206 --> 04:53.103
Oh.

04:53.344 --> 04:54.655
What's this?

04:57.482 --> 04:59.931
Matches the description I got
of the female robber's hair.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.344
Might have got caught
when she fled.

05:03.793 --> 05:05.103
Yeah I'll test it
back in the lab.

05:13.517 --> 05:14.448
What have you got?

05:17.344 --> 05:18.000
Oh.

05:19.344 --> 05:20.310
It's a knife sheath.

05:21.413 --> 05:22.655
Looks military.

05:23.379 --> 05:26.275
The realtor said that the
knife looked strange to her.

05:26.379 --> 05:28.827
Well I can cross check it
against the serrations.

05:28.931 --> 05:30.965
Maybe we can get an ID
what kind of knife it is.

05:32.241 --> 05:32.793
Here.

05:32.896 --> 05:34.655
Let's see.

05:34.758 --> 05:35.586
Come on Rex.

05:44.241 --> 05:45.379
What is it?

05:46.241 --> 05:49.620
Something about the details of
this case just seems familiar.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.034
Officer!

05:51.137 --> 05:52.965
I just remembered
one more thing.

05:53.827 --> 05:54.620
Okay.

05:57.034 --> 05:57.724
Hey Joe.

05:57.827 --> 05:58.689
You contact
the owners yet?

05:58.793 --> 05:59.482
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:59.586 --> 06:00.724
As a matter of
fact, I did.

06:00.827 --> 06:01.965
In Mykonos,
of all places.

06:02.068 --> 06:04.206
<i>They gave me a pre-lim
list of all the valuables-</i>

06:04.310 --> 06:05.241
that they had
in the house.

06:05.344 --> 06:06.275
But let me
tell you Charlie.

06:06.379 --> 06:07.620
The price of
this man's watch

06:07.724 --> 06:09.344
is enough to give a
good man a heart attack.

06:09.448 --> 06:11.172
How much do they
estimate was stolen?

06:11.275 --> 06:13.172
Over 70K.

06:13.275 --> 06:14.137
<i>Cash, valuables.</i>

06:15.827 --> 06:17.034
<i>Listen.</i>

06:17.137 --> 06:19.137
I am going to get Jesse to
trace the appointment details.

06:19.241 --> 06:21.413
But my money is
that they use aliases.

06:21.517 --> 06:23.172
<i>What are
you thinking?</i>

06:23.275 --> 06:25.862
It was something the realtor
said to me at the end.

06:25.965 --> 06:27.724
The male robber murmured
a Nietzsche quote to her-

06:27.827 --> 06:28.827
<i>before they escaped.</i>

06:28.931 --> 06:30.310
So he's philosophical.

06:30.413 --> 06:31.413
What was it?

06:31.517 --> 06:33.172
<i>Be aware, when you're
fighting monsters-</i>

06:33.275 --> 06:35.068
<i>you yourself don't
become a monster.</i>

06:35.172 --> 06:37.379
And this sticks
out to you why?

06:37.482 --> 06:39.344
Well because seven years ago,
I arrested a man, mid-robbery-

06:39.448 --> 06:41.517
who quoted me the
exact same thing.

06:41.620 --> 06:43.172
<i>Hopper Sun.</i>

06:43.275 --> 06:44.586
Hmm.

06:44.689 --> 06:45.965
Listen Jessie.

06:46.068 --> 06:47.241
Charlie wants you to pull up
Hopper Sun's record right away.

06:47.344 --> 06:47.931
Please.

06:48.034 --> 06:48.965
On it.

06:49.068 --> 06:50.103
Charlie, you
are on speaker.

06:50.931 --> 06:51.896
<i>Hey Charlie.</i>

06:52.000 --> 06:53.137
Hopper Sun,
in the flesh.

06:53.241 --> 06:55.000
Well not really in the flesh,
but you know what I mean.

06:55.344 --> 06:58.310
I arrested Hopper
on a country club B&E.

06:58.413 --> 07:01.034
He went after
jewelry and cash.

07:01.137 --> 07:01.793
Didn't have a knife.

07:01.896 --> 07:02.551
But he used-

07:02.655 --> 07:04.034
a blowtorch to
the back door!

07:04.137 --> 07:05.551
<i>Yeah, Sarah
found traces of one-</i>

07:05.655 --> 07:07.241
<i>at the crime
scene today.</i>

07:07.344 --> 07:08.965
Hopper was a
tough arrest.

07:09.068 --> 07:10.551
Left a scar
on my right arm.

07:10.655 --> 07:11.655
Yikes!

07:11.758 --> 07:13.034
Does Nietzsche have a
quote for bodily harm?

07:13.137 --> 07:14.758
<i>Looks like Hopper's been out-</i>

07:14.862 --> 07:16.448
<i>for a few months
now Charlie.</i>

07:16.551 --> 07:18.517
Can't teach an
old dog new tricks.

07:19.310 --> 07:20.482
Yeah, sorry pal.

07:20.586 --> 07:21.896
Bad figure of speech.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.241
Charlie do you think Hopper's
returned to his criminal ways?

07:24.344 --> 07:26.896
Well methodology wise
and criminal MO-

07:27.000 --> 07:28.482
They're similar.

07:28.586 --> 07:30.586
If he's out, I'd say he's our
best suspect right now.

07:30.689 --> 07:31.448
Jesse, I need you-

07:31.551 --> 07:32.344
to pull up the
appointment details

07:32.448 --> 07:33.206
from the open
house please.

07:33.310 --> 07:34.758
Yeah.

07:36.758 --> 07:38.413
<i>Okay,
robbers booked-</i>

07:38.517 --> 07:39.793
through the realtor's
website chatbot.

07:39.896 --> 07:41.896
They used the name
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.586
It's only the second most
common surname in town.

07:45.689 --> 07:47.172
And in the movies.

07:47.275 --> 07:48.862
Any known
affiliates of Hopper's?

07:48.965 --> 07:51.241
Anyone who
could be our Mrs.?

07:51.344 --> 07:53.689
<i>Looks like an
actual Mrs. to be honest.</i>

07:53.793 --> 07:54.689
<i>File said-</i>

07:54.793 --> 07:56.862
he was
recently married.

07:56.965 --> 07:57.965
That's one heck
of a honeymoon.

07:59.724 --> 08:00.551
<i>Charlie, I have
an address for you.</i>

08:00.655 --> 08:02.862
It's a church
off of Warden.

08:02.965 --> 08:04.586
Says he was a part-
time handyman there-

08:04.689 --> 08:05.482
post release.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.379
Text me the address.

08:06.482 --> 08:07.448
Rex and I
are on it.

09:08.793 --> 09:09.379
SJPD!

09:09.482 --> 09:10.827
Don't move!

09:13.793 --> 09:14.793
Officer Hudson?

09:15.551 --> 09:17.551
Officer Charlie Hudson?

09:18.482 --> 09:20.344
Major Sheridan, Sir?

09:20.448 --> 09:22.620
Your dad's not
around Charlie boy.

09:22.724 --> 09:24.206
You can
drop the <i>Sir.</i>

09:24.310 --> 09:28.620
You care to explain why you're
crashing Hopper's welding class?

09:31.448 --> 09:33.241
<i>Hopper's welding class?</i>

09:33.344 --> 09:35.000
Mm-hmm.

09:46.241 --> 09:46.862
<i>Today?</i>

09:46.965 --> 09:48.000
I was with
Major Sheridan

09:48.103 --> 09:49.793
walking his vets through
an electrical tutorial.

09:49.896 --> 09:51.103
I can confirm that.

09:51.206 --> 09:54.103
Hopper was with me
since O-900 teaching here.

09:54.206 --> 09:54.758
Okay!

09:54.862 --> 09:55.931
Okay well thanks Hopper.

09:56.034 --> 09:57.172
It's good to see
you're doing well.

09:57.275 --> 09:58.068
Yeah.

09:58.172 --> 09:59.137
I owe it
to you.

09:59.241 --> 10:00.068
You saved my life.

10:01.620 --> 10:03.206
Rex and I don't hear
that too often.

10:03.310 --> 10:04.275
Well it's true.

10:04.379 --> 10:06.724
After you arrested me
I took stock of my life.

10:06.827 --> 10:08.620
Spent my time in the
clink earning a degree.

10:08.724 --> 10:10.172
Got out, wanted
to give back.

10:10.275 --> 10:12.586
<i>The major here noticed my
work around the church.</i>

10:12.689 --> 10:14.068
And now I
teach his vets.

10:20.206 --> 10:20.827
<i>All right b'ys!</i>

10:20.931 --> 10:21.724
<i>Sorry about that!</i>

10:21.827 --> 10:23.068
He's not your guy.

10:23.172 --> 10:25.862
Well if you're his alibi,
he most definitely is not.

10:25.965 --> 10:26.724
Come on pal.

10:31.137 --> 10:33.000
<i>You're starting
to look like your old !</i>

10:33.103 --> 10:34.413
<i>I'll take that
as a compliment.</i>

10:35.448 --> 10:36.448
<i>How's everything
with the family?</i>

10:36.551 --> 10:37.586
<i>Same as always.</i>

10:37.689 --> 10:40.724
<i>So Jack and your dad
are getting into it?</i>

10:40.827 --> 10:41.689
<i>And you're playing referee?</i>

10:41.793 --> 10:43.137
<i>I get tired
of the circus.</i>

10:43.241 --> 10:44.000
<i>But what about you?</i>

10:44.103 --> 10:45.137
<i>I'm surprised
to even see you.</i>

10:45.241 --> 10:46.206
I thought you'd
still be overseas.

10:46.310 --> 10:50.275
I got injured on my
last tour pretty bad.

10:50.379 --> 10:50.965
I came home.

10:51.068 --> 10:52.758
When I was
in recovery-

10:52.862 --> 10:55.379
I had a hard time
getting back on my feet.

10:55.482 --> 10:56.724
I missed my comrades.

10:56.827 --> 10:57.620
Made me think.

10:57.724 --> 10:58.724
You're probably
not the only one.

10:58.827 --> 10:59.655
Bingo.

10:59.758 --> 11:02.689
The Church offered
me the space.

11:02.793 --> 11:05.034
I didn't give it
a second thought.

11:05.137 --> 11:07.344
Vets are in dire
need of community-

11:07.448 --> 11:09.965
of access to resources.

11:10.068 --> 11:13.000
More and more
find us every day!

11:13.103 --> 11:14.482
That's enough
about me.

11:14.586 --> 11:15.896
What's this case
you're working on?

11:16.000 --> 11:20.931
Ah, two suspects who robbed
an open house this morning.

11:21.034 --> 11:23.620
Terrorized a realtor
at knifepoint.

11:23.724 --> 11:24.517
<i>You're serious?</i>

11:24.620 --> 11:25.482
<i>Afraid so.</i>

11:25.586 --> 11:27.862
Actually you can
help me out with this.

11:27.965 --> 11:30.896
Our forensicist- she took
some photos of the crime scene.

11:31.000 --> 11:31.965
This knife sheath-

11:32.068 --> 11:34.448
is that military?

11:34.551 --> 11:37.137
That's a USM3 military
fighting knife.

11:37.241 --> 11:39.551
The military stamps all
its sheaths and knives.

11:39.655 --> 11:40.620
Is it common?

11:40.724 --> 11:43.344
Well it was if you
fought in World War II.

11:43.448 --> 11:44.517
Probably a million-

11:44.620 --> 11:46.551
<i>in circulation now between
vets and collectors.</i>

11:48.172 --> 11:48.896
<i>You think
these two-</i>

11:49.000 --> 11:51.344
are military?

11:51.448 --> 11:53.655
Case details are strong
enough to consider it.

11:55.000 --> 11:55.965
You're offended?

11:56.068 --> 11:59.620
No it just shows how
many good men and women

11:59.724 --> 12:01.034
don't get the
care they need!

12:01.137 --> 12:03.758
<i>Only a desperate
and dangerous person</i>

12:03.862 --> 12:07.689
points a trench knife
at a defenseless woman!

12:07.793 --> 12:10.137
I hope you and Rex
catch these two fast.

12:10.241 --> 12:12.793
And I hope to heck
they're not comrades.

12:12.896 --> 12:14.689
Yeah, me too.

12:14.793 --> 12:16.482
Come on pal.

12:16.586 --> 12:17.586
I'll see you.

12:32.103 --> 12:33.034
I heard you connected-

12:33.137 --> 12:34.620
with an old military
friend of your dad's?

12:34.724 --> 12:35.482
<i>Yeah!</i>

12:35.586 --> 12:36.827
Yeah he was like
an uncle to me.

12:36.931 --> 12:37.896
Was he right
about the knife?

12:38.000 --> 12:38.965
<i>Yeah, the serrations
on the rope</i>

12:39.068 --> 12:40.724
match the blade
of an USM3 knife.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.965
Well Sheridan is rarely
wrong about anything.

12:43.068 --> 12:44.655
I also finished testing
the hair sample-

12:44.758 --> 12:46.206
from the crime scene.

12:46.310 --> 12:47.413
I've got good
news and bad.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.655
Well that seems to
be this case's pattern.

12:49.758 --> 12:51.689
Yeah well the
hair is not human.

12:51.793 --> 12:52.655
It's not theirs.

12:52.758 --> 12:54.172
The robber was
wearing a wig?

12:54.275 --> 12:54.965
Yeah.

12:55.068 --> 12:56.517
So no DNA to
help with an ID.

12:56.620 --> 12:57.586
What's the good news?

12:57.689 --> 12:58.931
<i>It's Angora.</i>

12:59.034 --> 13:01.034
And there's only one place in
town that sells Angora Wigs.

13:01.137 --> 13:03.000
That is good news.

13:08.310 --> 13:09.275
<i>Yeah!</i>

13:09.379 --> 13:11.448
<i>We have Angora wigs
for humans or dolls.</i>

13:11.551 --> 13:14.310
It's superior to other
animal haired wigs.

13:14.413 --> 13:17.310
Do you have any recent sales of
a black Angora wig for humans-

13:17.413 --> 13:19.310
made maybe
with a credit card?

13:19.413 --> 13:21.517
Uh, let me check.

13:23.379 --> 13:24.620
Yes, there were two!

13:25.551 --> 13:26.517
<i>Credit card-</i>

13:26.620 --> 13:27.586
for a men's
short wig.

13:27.689 --> 13:29.793
And cash for a
woman's black wig.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.586
What do you remember about the
customer who bought in cash?

13:32.689 --> 13:34.068
Sunglasses.

13:34.172 --> 13:34.793
Hoodie.

13:34.896 --> 13:36.103
Turned her purse over-

13:36.206 --> 13:37.965
trying to fight for
every last coin she had.

13:38.586 --> 13:39.689
Huh.

13:39.793 --> 13:40.689
Was she
with a man?

13:41.379 --> 13:42.344
Yup!

13:42.448 --> 13:43.620
Husband maybe?

13:44.689 --> 13:46.206
<i>He said
something funny.</i>

13:46.310 --> 13:47.793
Like he was
in a rush.

13:47.896 --> 13:48.931
What was it?

13:49.758 --> 13:50.793
<i>Let's hit the silk?</i>

13:52.758 --> 13:53.862
<i>Hit the silk?</i>

13:53.965 --> 13:55.275
<i>Let's hit the silk.</i>

13:58.310 --> 13:59.000
<i>Hit the silk.</i>

13:59.103 --> 13:59.931
It's military slang.

14:00.034 --> 14:00.931
It means
to bail out.

14:01.034 --> 14:02.034
Usually used by paratroopers

14:02.137 --> 14:03.620
right before they
jump out of an aircraft.

14:03.724 --> 14:06.689
So the military slang, the
knife, infiltration techniques-

14:06.793 --> 14:08.275
I mean we're definitely
building a profile here.

14:08.379 --> 14:10.000
<i>Well the knot
used to tie up the realtor-</i>

14:10.103 --> 14:11.137
was a bowline knot.

14:11.241 --> 14:12.206
Usually used
to moor boats.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.137
<i>But also-</i>

14:13.241 --> 14:14.172
Let me guess-
used by the military?

14:14.448 --> 14:15.172
Yeah.

14:16.758 --> 14:18.206
I'm going to
ask Sheridan-

14:18.310 --> 14:19.758
<i>maybe to talk to
some of his contacts.</i>

14:19.862 --> 14:20.931
See if any paratroopers
have gone AWOL-

14:21.034 --> 14:21.620
off the base recently.

14:21.724 --> 14:22.620
That's a good idea.

14:22.724 --> 14:23.448
Both active duty-

14:23.551 --> 14:24.862
<i>and ex-military.</i>

14:24.965 --> 14:26.724
Jesse you have a lead on
any of the stolen jewelry?

14:26.827 --> 14:28.172
Yeah, actually.

14:28.275 --> 14:29.482
I ran a few searches.

14:29.586 --> 14:30.310
Got a hit-

14:30.413 --> 14:32.206
from a local
pawnshop's tweets.

14:34.689 --> 14:35.689
<i>Do these photos</i>

14:35.793 --> 14:36.896
<i>match the homeowners'
missing valuables?</i>

14:37.000 --> 14:38.241
Yeah they sure do.

14:38.344 --> 14:39.275
I asked them
to send photos-

14:39.379 --> 14:40.000
of their stolen jewelry.

14:40.103 --> 14:40.965
That way-

14:41.068 --> 14:42.068
we can cross-
reference some of the items-

14:42.172 --> 14:43.137
from Platinum
Pawn and Trade

14:43.241 --> 14:43.827
once we get them.

14:43.931 --> 14:45.862
Platinum Pawn, huh?

14:45.965 --> 14:46.655
Okay.

14:46.758 --> 14:47.965
<i>Rex, let's go.</i>

14:57.103 --> 14:57.827
<i>Detective.</i>

14:57.931 --> 14:58.482
<i>How are you?</i>

14:58.586 --> 14:59.241
<i>Hey.</i>

15:02.724 --> 15:04.689
<i>So have you been following
that gold heist out of Toronto?</i>

15:04.793 --> 15:06.206
I've kind of got
my hands full here.

15:07.103 --> 15:08.448
20 mil in
gold bricks!

15:08.551 --> 15:09.758
Marona mia!

15:09.862 --> 15:12.344
When you called, you said
something about an inscription.

15:12.448 --> 15:14.482
<i>To another 25 years,
my darling.</i>

15:14.586 --> 15:15.310
Yup.

15:15.413 --> 15:16.482
It's a match.

15:16.586 --> 15:17.758
Good luck to them.

15:17.862 --> 15:18.758
I'm on wife
number three.

15:19.793 --> 15:20.862
Should take a page
out of your book.

15:20.965 --> 15:22.275
Uh- what
do you mean?

15:22.379 --> 15:24.827
<i>Stick to furry companions.</i>

15:24.931 --> 15:26.862
What can you tell me about the
people who sold you these?

15:26.965 --> 15:28.448
I've got so
many people-

15:28.551 --> 15:30.172
coming in and out of
this place all the time-

15:30.275 --> 15:31.586
it's hard to remember.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.137
What about surveillance cameras?

15:37.241 --> 15:39.448
My customers appreciate
my discretion.

15:39.551 --> 15:40.517
There's no
cameras in here.

15:40.620 --> 15:42.344
Yeah I've been getting
a lot of that lately.

15:42.448 --> 15:44.620
Sorry I couldn't be
more help, Detective.

15:44.724 --> 15:45.551
<i>Did you know that</i>

15:45.655 --> 15:46.827
pawnbrokers by law-

15:46.931 --> 15:49.758
are required to collect
serial numbers, IDs-

15:49.862 --> 15:53.172
background information
on every single item-

15:53.275 --> 15:54.275
that they buy
from a seller?

15:54.379 --> 15:55.793
I'm going to
go out on a limb-

15:55.896 --> 15:57.620
and say that you don't have
any of that information.

15:58.931 --> 16:01.448
You more than anyone know how
much of a hassle paperwork is.

16:01.551 --> 16:03.551
Yeah and yet my
paperwork still gets done.

16:03.655 --> 16:04.586
So are you going
to cooperate?

16:04.689 --> 16:05.862
Or am I going
to have to-

16:06.793 --> 16:08.448
Hey listen.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.413
It's not good
for business-

16:09.517 --> 16:11.655
the cops coming in here,
asking questions.

16:11.758 --> 16:13.586
Yeah well lucky for you
I stop asking questions-

16:13.689 --> 16:14.896
when I start
getting answers.

16:15.206 --> 16:16.482
Track it.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.655
<i>A woman came
in here yesterday.</i>

16:26.758 --> 16:27.862
Said her grandfather died.

16:27.965 --> 16:29.551
Asked me what I can
give her on the spot.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.655
Was a man
with her?

16:30.758 --> 16:32.172
<i>No, just her.</i>

16:32.275 --> 16:33.793
Very beautiful woman.

16:33.896 --> 16:34.620
I think.

16:34.724 --> 16:35.758
She had glasses.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.310
Sunglasses.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.068
<i>It's hard to
tell sometimes.</i>

16:39.172 --> 16:40.000
Yeah.

16:53.724 --> 16:55.310
Looks like your dog
respects his heroes.

16:56.206 --> 16:57.172
Yeah, that may be.

16:57.275 --> 16:59.275
But he's working
right now.

16:59.379 --> 17:00.586
If he's interested
in an item-

17:00.689 --> 17:02.724
it's because he's picking up
the scent of our crime scene.

17:02.827 --> 17:04.310
What can you tell me
about these medals?

17:04.413 --> 17:05.862
A guy brought
them in last week.

17:05.965 --> 17:08.137
He got upset when
I gave him my price.

17:08.241 --> 17:09.896
I guess he thought
they were worth more.

17:10.000 --> 17:10.724
Let me guess.

17:10.827 --> 17:11.689
No paperwork
with these either?

17:11.793 --> 17:12.689
No.

17:12.793 --> 17:14.068
You know what I'm
going to say next?

17:14.172 --> 17:15.965
I'll start doing
my paperwork.

17:16.068 --> 17:17.310
Uh-huh.

17:17.413 --> 17:18.517
<i>He said something
funny though.</i>

17:18.620 --> 17:19.379
The man.

17:19.482 --> 17:20.827
On his way out.

17:20.931 --> 17:21.931
Something about silk?

17:23.413 --> 17:24.413
<i>Hit the silk?</i>

17:24.517 --> 17:25.655
Yeah, that's it.

17:25.758 --> 17:27.103
<i>Got to hit
the silk.</i>

17:27.206 --> 17:28.758
Sounded like something
an action hero would say.

17:28.862 --> 17:30.689
Very <i>figata.</i>

17:30.793 --> 17:32.689
That's one
word for it.

17:32.793 --> 17:33.931
Come on pal.

17:43.517 --> 17:45.000
Oh, hello!

17:45.103 --> 17:46.310
Do you have
an appointment?

17:48.482 --> 17:49.068
<i>What are you doing?</i>

17:49.172 --> 17:50.000
<i>What are you-?</i>

17:50.724 --> 17:51.448
<i>What is happening?</i>

17:51.551 --> 17:52.206
Oh!

17:55.206 --> 17:56.034
Open it.

17:56.827 --> 17:57.862
Now.

17:59.551 --> 18:00.310
<i>Go go go go!</i>

18:02.620 --> 18:03.655
Mrs. Dahl: <i>Okay.</i>

18:07.448 --> 18:08.586
Female robber:
<i>Out of the way!</i>

18:08.689 --> 18:09.413
Move!

18:19.413 --> 18:20.482
Female robber:
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

18:20.586 --> 18:21.517
<i>Let's hit the silk!</i>

18:23.310 --> 18:24.310
What is happening?

18:24.413 --> 18:26.620
There's been another
robbery Charlie.

18:26.724 --> 18:27.965
An interior designer-

18:28.068 --> 18:28.896
just off of
off Bonavista.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.379
Rex and I can
be there in five.

18:31.482 --> 18:32.931
They're on a
crime spree.

18:33.482 --> 18:34.586
And it's getting
more dangerous.

18:35.344 --> 18:36.379
Hang on pal.

18:47.482 --> 18:48.551
How much money
was in your safe?

18:48.655 --> 18:51.275
About 16-17 thousand.

18:51.379 --> 18:52.620
I do bank deposits
on Friday.

18:52.724 --> 18:54.379
That's a lot of money
to just keep around.

18:54.482 --> 18:56.310
Yeah suppliers prefer
negotiating in cash.

18:56.413 --> 18:57.827
And clients want
to save on tax.

18:57.931 --> 18:59.689
I've got to play ball
or I lose business.

18:59.793 --> 19:00.586
Mm-hmm.

19:00.689 --> 19:01.827
You said that
the female robber-

19:01.931 --> 19:03.758
she started to empty the
safe as soon as it was open.

19:03.862 --> 19:05.310
What was the
male robber doing?

19:05.413 --> 19:07.275
So he was moving
me toward my desk-

19:07.379 --> 19:08.448
rope in hand.

19:08.551 --> 19:10.724
I guess he was going to
tie me up or something.

19:10.827 --> 19:11.862
Yeah that's
a good guess.

19:11.965 --> 19:13.586
So that's when I
grabbed the scissors-

19:13.689 --> 19:14.586
and stabbed
him in the side.

19:14.689 --> 19:15.275
Mmmm.

19:15.379 --> 19:16.034
Quite brave.

19:16.137 --> 19:17.206
My father,
bless his soul-

19:17.310 --> 19:18.586
taught his children
how to fight.

19:20.413 --> 19:22.275
You said that she still
had the knife, though?

19:22.379 --> 19:23.827
Yeah but she was
over by the safe.

19:23.931 --> 19:25.241
<i>And next thing-</i>

19:25.344 --> 19:26.551
she drags him out.

19:26.655 --> 19:28.655
I thought she was going to
come after me after I hurt him!

19:28.758 --> 19:30.344
No no, it was about
getting the money out.

19:30.448 --> 19:31.137
It wasn't about retribution.

19:32.137 --> 19:33.172
Oh lucky me.

19:33.275 --> 19:34.068
This camera work?

19:34.172 --> 19:35.896
And the one in
the parking lot.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.586
Okay I'm going to need
access to both of those.

19:37.689 --> 19:38.724
<i>Also my forensicist-</i>

19:38.827 --> 19:40.103
is going to need
to test the scissors

19:40.206 --> 19:42.172
to see if we can get an ID
off the blood sample.

19:42.275 --> 19:43.137
Yeah, by all means.

19:43.241 --> 19:44.655
Whatever helps you
catch those animals.

19:45.862 --> 19:46.517
Rex.

19:46.896 --> 19:47.724
<i>Come on.</i>

19:55.758 --> 19:56.758
When this
case is over-

19:56.862 --> 19:58.758
remind me to talk to you
about your sugar intake.

19:58.862 --> 19:59.862
You use hazelnut creamer?

19:59.965 --> 20:00.896
Yeah, what
can I say?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.137
I like the finer
things in life.

20:02.241 --> 20:02.793
Like what?

20:02.896 --> 20:04.689
The insulin shock?

20:04.793 --> 20:07.758
Well I mean whatever gets the
feel good hormones pumping.

20:07.862 --> 20:10.206
Hey, so Sarah's in the lab
processing the blood sample.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.758
Are we waiting on Charlie
to scrub the security footage?

20:12.862 --> 20:14.551
No he's talking
to his military guy.

20:14.655 --> 20:15.965
He wants to find out
from the Major-

20:16.068 --> 20:17.379
whether or not
we can get an ID-

20:17.482 --> 20:19.793
based on the military
medals that we found.

20:19.896 --> 20:21.172
So, Mr. Hazelnut Creamer.

20:21.275 --> 20:22.275
It is just
you and me.

20:22.379 --> 20:22.965
All right.

20:23.068 --> 20:23.620
Bring it.

20:23.724 --> 20:24.413
So-

20:25.344 --> 20:26.344
Here we go.

20:26.448 --> 20:28.000
<i>Two suspects.</i>

20:28.103 --> 20:28.862
<i>Male and female.</i>

20:28.965 --> 20:29.620
<i>She's 5'6".</i>

20:29.724 --> 20:31.758
<i>He's about six foot.</i>

20:31.862 --> 20:32.758
<i>They're both right-handed.</i>

20:32.862 --> 20:33.517
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

20:33.620 --> 20:36.034
<i>There's no identifiable</i>

20:36.137 --> 20:39.103
tattoos, or piercings, or-

20:41.517 --> 20:42.413
Hang on.

20:43.172 --> 20:44.344
That.

20:44.448 --> 20:45.827
That's an identifying piece
of information right there.

20:45.931 --> 20:47.206
<i>A partial
license plate.</i>

20:47.310 --> 20:48.103
<i>Lucky us!</i>

20:48.206 --> 20:49.482
Make sure you
run that okay?

20:49.586 --> 20:50.482
Mm-hmm.

20:52.931 --> 20:54.827
Do we have any idea how
they're picking their targets?

20:54.931 --> 20:57.448
I can't make
a connection.

20:57.551 --> 21:00.068
There's lots of cash
and jewelry on site.

21:00.172 --> 21:01.379
These robbers
are up to

21:01.482 --> 21:03.206
close to a hundred thousand
dollars in their take now.

21:03.310 --> 21:05.448
<i>This case is taking
a turn Jesse.</i>

21:05.551 --> 21:06.413
<i>Desperation.</i>

21:06.517 --> 21:09.034
This last robbery
was sloppy.

21:10.413 --> 21:13.103
Sloppy criminals are usually
easier to find right?

21:13.206 --> 21:14.241
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:15.275 --> 21:16.379
They're also
more dangerous.

21:18.586 --> 21:20.551
<i>That's
a Cross of Valour.</i>

21:20.655 --> 21:22.758
It's a military decoration-

21:22.862 --> 21:27.068
given for courage in
circumstances of extreme peril.

21:27.172 --> 21:27.896
Is it valuable?

21:28.655 --> 21:29.827
Define value.

21:30.482 --> 21:32.034
I'd say it's priceless.

21:32.137 --> 21:35.344
Well the pawnbroker said that
the robber who sold it to him

21:35.448 --> 21:36.758
wasn't happy
with the price given.

21:36.862 --> 21:38.620
<i>My theory is that they
were trying to get money</i>

21:38.724 --> 21:39.689
<i>on the straight
and narrow.</i>

21:39.793 --> 21:41.689
And when they couldn't,
they went to crime.

21:41.793 --> 21:44.379
Yeah a lot of soldiers
can't make ends meet.

21:44.482 --> 21:46.241
<i>A Cross of Valour-</i>

21:46.896 --> 21:49.551
is worth more in
honour than dollars.

21:49.655 --> 21:51.103
<i>They wouldn't have
gotten much for it.</i>

21:51.206 --> 21:52.965
So your theory
holds up.

21:53.068 --> 21:56.206
Any idea how many of these would
be handed out in the country?

21:56.310 --> 21:57.172
Less than 40.

21:57.275 --> 21:58.068
Ever?

21:58.172 --> 21:58.931
Yep.

21:59.034 --> 21:59.586
Wow.

21:59.689 --> 22:00.551
Okay.

22:00.655 --> 22:01.896
Well that helps
narrow things down.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.206
Could help
us get an I.D.

22:03.310 --> 22:04.103
Thanks.

22:04.206 --> 22:05.103
Hey.

22:05.793 --> 22:10.310
Look what I found
in my old kit.

22:14.758 --> 22:16.310
<i>Wow,
Dad is so young.</i>

22:16.413 --> 22:17.000
Yeah.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.310
I called him.

22:18.413 --> 22:19.275
Told him I saw you.

22:19.379 --> 22:21.103
Yeah he's always happy
to hear from you.

22:21.206 --> 22:23.655
He'd be happier hearing
from someone else.

22:25.620 --> 22:27.379
You didn't tell me
you two weren't talking.

22:27.482 --> 22:29.793
I told you I'm tired of playing
referee between him and Jack.

22:31.206 --> 22:32.793
He misses his sons.

22:32.896 --> 22:37.413
<i>You know, when you're out
there, like he and I were-</i>

22:37.517 --> 22:40.310
everything is
good and evil-

22:40.413 --> 22:43.344
<i>life and death,
black and white.</i>

22:43.448 --> 22:44.724
<i>And sometimes-</i>

22:44.827 --> 22:46.551
if you make
it home-

22:49.965 --> 22:52.793
you forget that the
world exists in grey.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Don't hold that
against him Charlie.

23:07.724 --> 23:08.379
Hey Charlie.

23:09.551 --> 23:10.137
Hey.

23:10.241 --> 23:11.034
Hey Rex.

23:11.137 --> 23:12.482
Yeah I was getting
to you too!

23:12.586 --> 23:13.896
Jeez, someone's testy today.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.275
Yeah we skipped lunch.

23:15.379 --> 23:16.310
<i>Oh, yeah
I get it.</i>

23:16.413 --> 23:17.551
Hangry is as
hangry does.

23:17.655 --> 23:19.413
Listen, I was able to trace
the partial license plate-

23:19.517 --> 23:20.206
of the getaway car-

23:20.310 --> 23:22.517
to a Jeep stolen
four days ago.

23:22.620 --> 23:23.517
<i>Owners name
is Remy Meyers.</i>

23:23.620 --> 23:24.724
<i>He's on his way
into the station.</i>

23:24.827 --> 23:25.689
Then so are we.

23:25.793 --> 23:26.344
We're on it.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.206
Perfect.

23:27.310 --> 23:28.206
Rex, should I get
on some lunch?

23:28.310 --> 23:28.896
Okay pal.

23:30.103 --> 23:31.034
On it.

23:31.137 --> 23:33.000
You found
my jeep right?

23:33.103 --> 23:34.275
Yeah.

23:34.379 --> 23:36.482
It's connected to a series
of crimes we're investigating.

23:36.586 --> 23:37.896
You said that-

23:38.344 --> 23:38.689
<i>it was stolen from
a mall parking lot?</i>

23:38.827 --> 23:39.517
<i>Which one exactly?</i>

23:39.620 --> 23:40.551
Uh, Avalon Mall.

23:40.655 --> 23:42.862
<i>I was there buying
some ear pods.</i>

23:42.965 --> 23:43.827
Oh man.

23:43.931 --> 23:44.862
Guess I'm never seeing
those again, huh?

23:44.965 --> 23:46.413
<i>They were
brand new too.</i>

23:46.517 --> 23:47.206
Ear pods?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

23:47.310 --> 23:48.379
I left the bag
on the seat

23:48.482 --> 23:49.931
when I ran back inside
to grab a burrito.

23:50.034 --> 23:52.206
<i>I assumed that's why
my car was stolen.</i>

23:52.310 --> 23:54.551
The thief saw the ear
pods and jacked it.

23:54.655 --> 23:55.965
You still have
that receipt?

23:56.068 --> 23:57.448
Yeah I could dig
that up for you.

23:58.793 --> 23:59.586
Yeah!

24:10.137 --> 24:10.862
<i>Yes!</i>

24:10.965 --> 24:12.137
Wow!

24:12.241 --> 24:13.241
I've never seen someone so
excited about a blood sample.

24:13.344 --> 24:14.689
<i>Well-</i>

24:15.137 --> 24:16.068
<i>you would be too if
you just discovered</i>

24:16.344 --> 24:18.172
that this blood has a lower
than average hematocrit value!

24:18.275 --> 24:19.413
Ah!

24:19.517 --> 24:21.931
Okay what does that mean
for us non-forensic cops?

24:22.034 --> 24:22.689
Anemia.

24:22.793 --> 24:24.206
Our male robber
is anemic.

24:24.310 --> 24:25.931
<i>So we may be
looking for an anemic soldier.</i>

24:26.034 --> 24:27.862
Joe can you use your
contacts at the military-

24:27.965 --> 24:29.448
to see if we can get
their medical files-

24:29.551 --> 24:30.413
<i>to cross reference?</i>

24:30.517 --> 24:31.586
Yeah I'll see
what I can do.

24:31.689 --> 24:32.241
That's good work.

24:32.344 --> 24:33.310
Thank you.

24:33.413 --> 24:34.310
<i>Rex and I
are heading back up.</i>

24:34.413 --> 24:35.068
Okay.

24:36.758 --> 24:39.724
So this was delivered
to me by HR today.

24:42.344 --> 24:43.793
Oh yeah!

24:43.896 --> 24:44.931
Right.

24:45.655 --> 24:47.344
You need two days off
a week from the force?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.586
Yeah just for some courses
I'm taking up in Halifax-

24:51.689 --> 24:52.620
for my PhD work.

24:52.724 --> 24:53.379
Yeah I see that.

24:53.482 --> 24:54.931
It's Behavioral Sciences.

24:55.034 --> 24:58.241
Uh- I mean I'll sign
off and support this.

24:58.344 --> 24:59.379
But um-

25:01.241 --> 25:01.827
Look Sarah.

25:01.931 --> 25:03.034
I know how
this works.

25:03.137 --> 25:05.482
<i>I know what it means
when one of my best officers</i>

25:05.586 --> 25:06.482
hones up
their resume-

25:06.586 --> 25:08.103
and is
taking courses.

25:08.206 --> 25:10.310
It usually means I'm looking
for a new forensicists-

25:10.413 --> 25:11.034
<i>to join the team.</i>

25:11.137 --> 25:11.896
No.

25:12.000 --> 25:12.586
No no no, Joe.

25:12.689 --> 25:13.379
It's nothing like that.

25:14.793 --> 25:16.000
No I'm still here!

25:16.103 --> 25:17.689
I mean this
is my lab!

25:19.034 --> 25:20.103
It's good!

25:20.448 --> 25:21.655
I'm not going anywhere!

25:22.551 --> 25:23.172
Okay!

25:24.103 --> 25:25.172
Stop.

26:06.344 --> 26:07.068
Yeah.

26:19.310 --> 26:20.172
I know.

26:20.275 --> 26:21.448
We'll get this going.

26:36.206 --> 26:36.758
Good morning!

26:36.862 --> 26:37.827
<i>Morning!</i>

26:38.137 --> 26:38.793
<i>It is indeed
a good morning.</i>

26:38.931 --> 26:40.344
The military has
agreed to cooperate.

26:40.448 --> 26:42.241
And they're sending us the
medical files that they have.

26:42.344 --> 26:43.413
Well that's great.

26:43.517 --> 26:44.827
We should have an ID on
the male robber then soon.

26:44.931 --> 26:45.620
Yeah.

26:45.724 --> 26:46.724
Hold on a second.

26:46.827 --> 26:48.172
How much creamer do
you put in your coffee?

26:49.689 --> 26:50.758
Uh-

26:50.862 --> 26:51.965
what's wrong with a little
cinnamon and vanilla-

26:52.068 --> 26:52.724
in your coffee?

26:52.827 --> 26:54.103
Everything.

26:56.103 --> 26:56.724
What about you Charlie?

26:56.827 --> 26:57.379
Black?

26:57.482 --> 26:58.068
Yeah!

26:58.172 --> 26:59.068
Yes!

26:59.172 --> 27:00.379
That's my man.

27:00.482 --> 27:02.551
Coffee's not the only thing
making me happy this morning.

27:02.655 --> 27:03.896
Why- you find
something Jesse?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Mmmm!

27:05.103 --> 27:05.862
Well you know,
not much.

27:05.965 --> 27:07.310
Just stayed up
half the night-

27:07.413 --> 27:10.103
and pulled off a Marvelous
Mills hack and track.

27:10.206 --> 27:12.172
<i>Oh I think they
call that a humble brag.</i>

27:12.275 --> 27:13.241
<i>What's
with all the dots?</i>

27:13.344 --> 27:14.586
<i>Okay, I'm
glad you asked.</i>

27:14.689 --> 27:16.965
<i>So using the serial
number from the receipt</i>

27:17.068 --> 27:18.482
of Remy's ear pods-

27:18.586 --> 27:20.344
I was able to hack into the
ear-pods' Bluetooth system

27:20.448 --> 27:23.724
<i>and enable the</i> Find
my Ear Pods <i>feature.</i>

27:23.827 --> 27:24.413
And ta-da!

27:24.517 --> 27:25.793
It worked!

27:25.896 --> 27:28.000
We now know where the robbers
and the stolen car have been.

27:28.103 --> 27:29.517
How did
you do that?

27:29.620 --> 27:31.241
<i>When the</i> Find My Ear Pods
<i>feature is turned on-</i>

27:31.344 --> 27:33.344
it sends out this
Bluetooth signal-

27:33.448 --> 27:34.965
to all these neighbouring
Bluetooth devices-

27:35.068 --> 27:36.068
and in effect-

27:36.172 --> 27:37.103
<i>creates this digital map-</i>

27:37.413 --> 27:37.931
<i>of all these
surrounding pings.</i>

27:38.034 --> 27:38.586
<i>Hey.</i>

27:38.689 --> 27:39.551
<i>Military medical files-</i>

27:39.655 --> 27:40.241
just came in.

27:40.344 --> 27:41.655
And we
have our guy.

27:41.758 --> 27:44.206
His name is Sergeant
Henry Reinhardt.

27:44.310 --> 27:45.655
<i>And it lists here
on his medical file-</i>

27:45.758 --> 27:46.793
<i>that he is anemic.</i>

27:46.896 --> 27:48.931
Okay so that ties him to
the second robbery scene.

27:49.034 --> 27:50.827
And he was awarded
the Medal of Valour?

27:50.931 --> 27:52.448
Yeah we won it during
his tour in Afghanistan.

27:52.965 --> 27:54.413
I mean this is
our guy Charlie.

27:54.517 --> 27:55.482
All of the
details track.

27:56.448 --> 27:57.517
Guys.

27:57.620 --> 27:59.793
<i>The ear-pods pinged
from the hospital.</i>

27:59.896 --> 28:01.344
If he's still bleeding
from his scissors wound-

28:01.448 --> 28:02.241
he's susceptible
to bleeding out.

28:02.344 --> 28:02.931
He went for help.

28:03.034 --> 28:03.586
You got it.

28:03.689 --> 28:04.689
<i>Rex, let's go.</i>

28:05.620 --> 28:08.103
Like I said, another Marvelous
Mills hack-and-track.

28:12.034 --> 28:14.206
I normally say we don't allow
animals in the hospital.

28:14.310 --> 28:14.862
But he's-

28:14.965 --> 28:16.068
He's a detective.

28:16.172 --> 28:17.793
Sergeant Reinhardt's
a patient of yours?

28:17.896 --> 28:18.448
Yes.

28:18.551 --> 28:19.275
But to be honest-

28:19.379 --> 28:20.586
What is it?

28:20.689 --> 28:22.965
Unless these robberies of yours
happened three weeks ago-

28:23.068 --> 28:25.758
there's no way the
sergeant is involved.

28:39.068 --> 28:40.068
<i>The sergeant
was admitted-</i>

28:40.172 --> 28:41.482
<i>when his health took
a turn for the worse.</i>

28:41.586 --> 28:42.586
What's he fighting?

28:42.689 --> 28:44.241
Stage-4 Glioblastoma.

28:44.344 --> 28:46.310
It's a fast growing and
aggressive brain tumor.

28:46.413 --> 28:47.000
Cancer.

28:47.103 --> 28:48.034
What's his prognosis?

28:48.137 --> 28:49.034
Less than six months.

28:49.137 --> 28:50.862
Like I said,
it's aggressive.

28:50.965 --> 28:52.551
<i>His children took
it especially hard.</i>

28:52.655 --> 28:53.275
Children?

28:53.379 --> 28:54.827
Yes, Frances and Jamieson.

28:54.931 --> 28:57.137
I've never seen a
daughter more shook.

28:57.241 --> 28:58.931
Both of them have been
glued to his bedside-

28:59.034 --> 29:00.551
except for the
last few days.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.068
Have either of his
children been here today?

29:02.827 --> 29:03.689
Actually-

29:03.793 --> 29:05.689
they left right before
you two came in.

29:05.793 --> 29:06.482
Jesse.

29:06.586 --> 29:07.689
The robbers
are on the move.

29:09.862 --> 29:10.965
Where am I
going Jesse?

29:11.068 --> 29:11.793
<i>Stand by.</i>

29:11.896 --> 29:12.448
Hang on pal.

29:12.551 --> 29:13.310
Okay okay.

29:13.413 --> 29:14.448
Just got a ping
on Marine Drive.

29:14.551 --> 29:15.862
Yeah, I got you.

29:17.206 --> 29:17.862
Okay there's a bend.

29:17.965 --> 29:18.827
You want to turn
around that.

29:18.931 --> 29:19.551
You want to ease-

29:19.655 --> 29:20.655
<i>Yeah follow that street!</i>

29:21.517 --> 29:22.448
Stop breathing so heavy!

29:22.551 --> 29:23.241
I can't concentrate!

29:23.344 --> 29:23.965
<i>Make a left!</i>

29:24.068 --> 29:25.068
<i>Make a left!</i>

29:26.758 --> 29:27.689
<i>Heavy fog out here.</i>

29:27.793 --> 29:29.275
I can't see!

29:29.379 --> 29:30.586
Right or left Jesse?

29:30.689 --> 29:31.931
<i>Charlie you
are so close!</i>

29:32.034 --> 29:32.965
Right or left?

29:33.068 --> 29:33.758
Okay make a right!

29:33.862 --> 29:34.413
Make a right!

29:34.517 --> 29:35.413
Right!

29:39.000 --> 29:40.517
Okay they're not too far
ahead of you Charlie.

29:40.620 --> 29:41.206
I got them.

29:41.310 --> 29:41.862
<i>Keep going right.</i>

29:41.965 --> 29:42.517
Turning right pal.

29:42.620 --> 29:43.206
Hang on.

29:48.551 --> 29:49.827
Yeah I'm right on
their tail Jesse!

29:53.517 --> 29:54.103
<i>Go go go</i>!

29:54.206 --> 29:54.862
I'm trying!

30:00.482 --> 30:01.068
<i>Speed!</i>

30:01.172 --> 30:01.758
Speed Charlie!

30:15.551 --> 30:16.448
School bus ahead.

30:16.551 --> 30:17.482
So they do
too then!

30:17.586 --> 30:18.517
Except they're going past!

30:27.482 --> 30:28.413
Talk to me Jesse.

30:28.517 --> 30:29.344
<i>Okay Charlie.</i>

30:29.448 --> 30:31.103
They're just stopped
around the bend!

30:31.206 --> 30:32.034
Right in
front of you!

30:32.137 --> 30:33.000
It's a dead
end street!

30:34.344 --> 30:35.482
Come on pal.

31:13.862 --> 31:14.689
Jesse.

31:14.793 --> 31:16.413
<i>Did you find
the jeep?</i>

31:16.517 --> 31:17.793
Yeah.

31:19.379 --> 31:20.586
But they're gone.

31:26.379 --> 31:27.137
<i>Sarah.</i>

31:28.034 --> 31:28.931
<i>Hey!</i>

31:29.586 --> 31:30.862
<i>Any luck?</i>

31:30.965 --> 31:32.586
Rex tracked their scent
out into the woods.

31:32.689 --> 31:34.517
But we lost
them at a river.

31:34.620 --> 31:35.965
<i>Any luck here?</i>

31:36.068 --> 31:37.413
<i>I've got fingerprints
on the steering wheel-</i>

31:37.517 --> 31:39.137
glove box, window handle.

31:39.241 --> 31:41.724
Let's hope the DNA evidence
can get us our two IDs

31:41.827 --> 31:43.620
Well Rex and I might be
able to help with that.

31:43.724 --> 31:44.827
I'm going to
give Jesse a call.

31:44.931 --> 31:45.931
Okay.

31:47.793 --> 31:49.034
What?

31:50.310 --> 31:51.448
Charlie, you
guys find them?

31:51.551 --> 31:52.793
<i>No we lost
them in the woods.</i>

31:52.896 --> 31:53.689
<i>But hey.</i>

31:53.793 --> 31:56.827
Jesse can you run
two names for me?

31:56.931 --> 31:58.758
Frances and Jamieson Reinhardt.

31:58.862 --> 31:59.724
Yeah okay.

31:59.827 --> 32:01.103
Yeah give
me one sec.

32:02.206 --> 32:04.310
<i>Suspects are a
brother and sister act.</i>

32:04.413 --> 32:06.206
<i>Frances and Jamieson.</i>

32:06.310 --> 32:08.206
Okay Charlie,
check your phone.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.551
<i>Frances was ex-military.</i>

32:11.655 --> 32:14.931
<i>She took a leave of
absence from active duty.</i>

32:15.034 --> 32:17.068
Says here she has
extensive tactical training.

32:17.172 --> 32:19.413
I guess that explains her
comfort level with a knife.

32:19.517 --> 32:20.896
What do we have
on the brother?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.137
Jamieson wasn't military.

32:22.241 --> 32:23.206
But-

32:23.310 --> 32:26.413
he's working at the
automotive warehouse.

32:26.517 --> 32:28.379
He inherited the anemia
from his father.

32:28.482 --> 32:30.517
But other than that, neither
of them have so much-

32:30.620 --> 32:32.482
<i>as a traffic violation.</i>

32:32.586 --> 32:33.655
Do we have
any addresses?

32:33.758 --> 32:35.379
I have out of province
addresses for both of them.

32:35.482 --> 32:36.103
But nothing local.

32:36.206 --> 32:38.551
<i>Interestingly enough-</i>

32:38.655 --> 32:40.068
their father's apartment
recently sold.

32:40.965 --> 32:42.896
So what is an out of province
tactical expert and her brother

32:43.000 --> 32:44.103
doing on a
crime spree?

32:44.206 --> 32:45.172
Their dad's sick.

32:45.275 --> 32:47.103
The doctor said he
doesn't have long to live.

32:47.206 --> 32:49.448
Maybe the money's for
funeral arrangements?

32:49.896 --> 32:51.448
Yeah but Jesse,
they're up over 100K.

32:51.551 --> 32:54.448
What kind of funeral
are they planning?

32:54.551 --> 32:55.896
Jesse do me
a favour.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.896
See if they have any
experimental treatment-

32:58.000 --> 33:00.344
for Stage-4 Glioblastoma.

33:00.448 --> 33:01.379
<i>Let's see
what it costs.</i>

33:01.482 --> 33:02.206
Okay.

33:02.310 --> 33:03.103
Wait, hold on Charlie.

33:03.206 --> 33:04.000
Do you think
they're trying-

33:04.103 --> 33:04.896
to save their
father's life?

33:05.000 --> 33:06.241
Maybe.

33:06.344 --> 33:08.862
Why else would a soldier whose
job it is to protect our country

33:08.965 --> 33:11.310
all of a sudden put civilian
lives at risk for money?

33:11.413 --> 33:12.965
Okay here we go.

33:13.068 --> 33:14.482
Out of country experimental
cancer treatments

33:14.586 --> 33:17.896
<i>start at 150
to 180 thousand.</i>

33:18.000 --> 33:20.310
Some of them even
go up to 300K!

33:20.413 --> 33:21.241
<i>Okay.</i>

33:21.344 --> 33:22.689
Okay so if that's
what this is about-

33:22.793 --> 33:24.344
then they're still short.

33:24.448 --> 33:25.965
Which means there's
going to be another score.

33:26.068 --> 33:27.931
Which means that we should be
looking for cash-heavy events.

33:28.034 --> 33:28.689
<i>Charlie.</i>

33:30.034 --> 33:30.689
Hey Jesse.

33:30.793 --> 33:32.275
Just give me
a sec okay?

33:32.379 --> 33:32.965
<i>Hey.</i>

33:33.068 --> 33:34.137
Check this out.

33:34.241 --> 33:36.413
I found it under
the driver's floor mat.

33:36.517 --> 33:39.448
MX1 250 to 450 CC?

33:39.551 --> 33:40.379
Is that code?

33:40.482 --> 33:42.172
No, motocross bikes.

33:42.275 --> 33:43.655
They're different
type of bike models.

33:43.758 --> 33:44.379
Aha!

33:44.482 --> 33:45.344
Oh hey!

33:45.448 --> 33:47.655
How is your motorcycle
coming along?

33:49.275 --> 33:50.103
Ah-

33:50.206 --> 33:50.758
Hey Jesse.

33:50.862 --> 33:51.758
Can you
check to see

33:51.862 --> 33:53.379
if there's any
motocross events in town?

33:53.482 --> 33:54.068
It's okay pal.

33:54.172 --> 33:55.482
Yeah, can do.

33:55.586 --> 33:58.413
These events- they usually
have big cash prizes.

33:58.517 --> 34:00.896
That would be my next
target if I were them.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.517
Well I just hope
they think like you.

34:54.275 --> 34:54.965
Hey!

34:55.448 --> 34:56.689
I'm wouldn't.

35:08.310 --> 35:09.655
SJPD!

35:11.827 --> 35:13.344
Put the weapon down!

35:13.448 --> 35:14.862
Not today.

35:20.689 --> 35:21.413
Put the
weapon down!

35:21.517 --> 35:22.620
<i>Nobody needs
to get hurt!</i>

35:25.517 --> 35:26.172
Rex!

35:43.586 --> 35:44.689
<i>Whoah, watch it!</i>

35:44.793 --> 35:45.448
<i>Hey!</i>

36:05.758 --> 36:06.413
Hey Charlie.

36:06.517 --> 36:07.275
We're all here.

36:07.379 --> 36:09.034
Frances got away.

36:09.137 --> 36:10.034
But we got Jamieson.

36:10.137 --> 36:11.137
They're taking him
in to the station now.

36:12.103 --> 36:13.103
<i>Good job, you two.</i>

36:13.206 --> 36:14.344
Jesse has an update.

36:14.448 --> 36:16.172
Yeah, I just spoke with an
experimental medical clinic-

36:16.275 --> 36:17.241
in Mexico-

36:17.344 --> 36:19.310
<i>that said that Frances
has been in touch-</i>

36:19.413 --> 36:20.724
inquiring about their success
rate with brain tumors.

36:20.827 --> 36:21.965
Looks like you
were right Charlie.

36:22.068 --> 36:23.827
And yet it doesn't
feel so good.

36:23.931 --> 36:25.620
The success rate
for such a treatment

36:25.724 --> 36:26.862
is less than
4% though.

36:26.965 --> 36:28.655
Yeah I mean the clinicians
explained all that.

36:28.758 --> 36:31.103
And yet, Frances was
still adamant to try.

36:31.206 --> 36:33.034
And she even asked if she
could pay in installments.

36:33.137 --> 36:35.103
I guess if you have one chance
to save your dad's life-

36:35.206 --> 36:35.862
you take it?

36:35.965 --> 36:37.137
Where are you
two headed?

36:37.241 --> 36:39.310
I've got to go
pick something up.

36:39.413 --> 36:41.275
<i>Then I'm heading to where
I wager Frances is going.</i>

37:12.344 --> 37:13.965
I wouldn't.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.068
Rex'll take you down-

37:18.172 --> 37:19.655
before you even get your
foot to the kick start.

37:26.241 --> 37:29.517
Just let me get
my dad on a plane.

37:29.620 --> 37:30.413
Okay after that-

37:30.517 --> 37:31.482
I'll surrender myself.

37:31.586 --> 37:33.586
There's no plane Frances.

37:35.551 --> 37:36.862
The funds are
stolen money.

37:36.965 --> 37:37.517
It's gone now.

37:37.620 --> 37:39.586
So what?

37:40.206 --> 37:40.793
Huh?

37:40.896 --> 37:42.517
I'm just-

37:42.620 --> 37:44.655
I'm just supposed
to let him die?

37:44.758 --> 37:46.758
And do nothing?

37:49.758 --> 37:51.448
No.

37:51.551 --> 37:52.724
The mission
was to save him.

37:52.827 --> 37:54.310
And I finish
what I start.

37:54.413 --> 37:55.758
<i>You tried.</i>

37:56.931 --> 37:58.482
And innocent
people got hurt.

38:00.482 --> 38:01.586
Hey.

38:01.689 --> 38:03.965
Not every mission
is meant to succeed.

38:07.620 --> 38:08.758
I can't just-

38:10.655 --> 38:12.931
I can't just sit
in jail while he's-

38:13.034 --> 38:16.034
You'll request visits
on compassionate grounds.

38:16.137 --> 38:17.448
Visits?

38:20.172 --> 38:21.827
My father is dying.

38:23.931 --> 38:25.896
<i>He'll be alone.</i>

38:28.068 --> 38:30.310
You already have
my brother.

38:30.413 --> 38:31.758
Can't you just- ?

38:33.517 --> 38:35.827
Just tell them
you couldn't find me.

38:35.931 --> 38:38.965
<i>Just give me a
few more days.</i>

38:41.758 --> 38:45.689
Do you even know what it takes
to get a Medal of Valour?

38:45.793 --> 38:49.206
<i>How rare that is?</i>

38:49.310 --> 38:51.655
Because it's for
exceptional bravery-

38:51.758 --> 38:54.103
by someone who puts
themselves in harm's way

38:54.206 --> 38:55.896
to protect others!

38:56.000 --> 38:59.827
And it is a one
in a million person

38:59.931 --> 39:02.275
in their lifetime
that does that!

39:04.620 --> 39:07.241
<i>That's my dad!</i>

39:07.344 --> 39:08.827
One in a million.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.241
And now-

39:15.793 --> 39:17.172
he's just
fading away.

39:17.275 --> 39:20.206
And no on cares except
for me and my brother!

39:20.310 --> 39:22.000
He's been forgotten!

39:26.655 --> 39:30.034
And that is not the way
that a hero should die.

39:33.655 --> 39:37.689
Forgotten isn't how
anyone should die!

39:42.241 --> 39:44.034
I think I know someone
who can help your father.

39:45.827 --> 39:47.103
What- you have-

39:47.206 --> 39:48.724
you know a
miracle worker?

39:48.827 --> 39:51.896
No, he's a
retired major.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.275
He's a soldier,
like both of you.

39:54.379 --> 39:57.551
<i>Maybe he could help
your Dad get to Mexico.</i>

39:57.655 --> 39:58.827
I don't know.

39:58.931 --> 40:01.655
Maybe he'll just be here
for your dad when you can't be.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.241
<i>I'll make the call-</i>

40:08.517 --> 40:10.275
if you get
off that bike-

40:11.034 --> 40:12.068
and you put
your hands up-

40:12.172 --> 40:13.896
and you let me
take you in.

40:19.137 --> 40:20.103
What do you think?

40:23.000 --> 40:26.896
I think that sounds like
a promise that disappears-

40:27.000 --> 40:28.413
once I'm in jail.

40:31.517 --> 40:33.758
I have no reason
to trust you.

40:36.689 --> 40:38.448
My dad is
in the Navy.

40:41.241 --> 40:45.275
I would not lie
to a soldier.

40:55.724 --> 40:58.379
You know we didn't do all of
this just for the treatment.

41:02.620 --> 41:05.655
Mexico has one of the
seven wonders of the world.

41:05.758 --> 41:07.448
Chichén Itzá.

41:07.551 --> 41:09.551
Yeah.

41:09.655 --> 41:11.206
The Warriors' Temple.

41:12.793 --> 41:16.241
My dad always
wanted to see it.

41:19.517 --> 41:22.965
Cancer gets his life.

41:23.068 --> 41:25.241
But it shouldn't
get his dreams.

41:32.448 --> 41:34.034
A Medal of Valour-

41:35.172 --> 41:37.896
does not belong
in some pawn shop.

41:39.310 --> 41:40.689
<i>It belongs with him.</i>

41:45.103 --> 41:46.275
Thank you.

42:03.689 --> 42:04.620
<i>Well, Rex.</i>

42:04.724 --> 42:06.724
<i>Sounds like you
were quite the hero!</i>

42:08.068 --> 42:09.827
What would old Charlie
boy do without you, huh?

42:09.931 --> 42:11.586
Well you know the value
of a good partnership.

42:11.689 --> 42:12.862
I do.

42:13.655 --> 42:16.172
Looks like you two
are the real deal.

42:17.241 --> 42:18.586
What about them?

42:18.689 --> 42:19.896
<i>Frances and Jamieson?</i>

42:20.000 --> 42:21.896
They're looking
at hard time.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.448
But they're very happy-

42:24.551 --> 42:26.586
that you're looking
out for their dad.

42:26.689 --> 42:28.862
Well they have you to
thank for arranging that.

42:30.896 --> 42:32.241
Don't be a
stranger, Charlie.

42:33.206 --> 42:34.517
<i>You're family.</i>

42:34.620 --> 42:35.517
I won't.

42:36.206 --> 42:37.379
<i>Hey.</i>

42:37.482 --> 42:40.758
Do you think I could
borrow Rex for a quick few?

42:40.862 --> 42:43.448
There's a vet inside
who's a big fan of dogs.

42:43.551 --> 42:44.931
You want to go
for a walk, Rex?

42:47.482 --> 42:48.310
Good boy.

42:48.413 --> 42:49.000
Thanks.

42:49.103 --> 42:49.655
Yeah.

42:49.758 --> 42:50.931
Come on, Rex.

42:57.206 --> 42:58.620
<i>There you go.</i>

43:01.137 --> 43:01.758
Hey!

43:01.862 --> 43:04.827
Dad, it's me.

43:04.931 --> 43:05.793
Yeah!

43:08.068 --> 43:09.827
Yeah it's good to
hear your voice too.
