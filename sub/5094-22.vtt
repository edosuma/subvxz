01:23.197 --> 01:24.397
I will kill you!

01:24.399 --> 01:25.665
I will
kill you!

01:25.667 --> 01:26.966
Stay away
from my daughter!

01:26.968 --> 01:28.167
Stay away from my daughter!

01:28.169 --> 01:30.336
Hey! Hey, break it up!

01:33.441 --> 01:35.308
Against the wall. Now!
Against the wall.

01:35.310 --> 01:36.776
Against the wall now.
Stop.

01:36.778 --> 01:39.045
This Arab is paying my daughter
to marry him.

01:39.047 --> 01:41.247
He is the criminal here.
He is not!

01:41.249 --> 01:43.783
I don't know where he
gets this crazy idea from.

01:43.785 --> 01:45.718
He is Syrian, student visa.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.220
Hey, hey, sir,

01:47.222 --> 01:48.388
what is your name?

01:48.390 --> 01:49.722
Bartosz Mazurski.

01:49.724 --> 01:51.491
All right, Mr. Mazurski,

01:51.493 --> 01:52.825
it's against the law
to assault someone

01:52.827 --> 01:54.060
for being a Syrian student.

01:54.062 --> 01:55.929
That is not why.
You want to know why?

01:55.931 --> 01:57.163
No, not really.
He have to go back,

01:57.165 --> 01:58.598
so he's paying my daughter

01:58.600 --> 02:00.600
to marry him
so he can stay here in America!

02:00.602 --> 02:02.635
No, Officer, that is not
what is going on.

02:02.637 --> 02:04.103
Okay, okay.

02:04.105 --> 02:06.139
Yeah, they deny that, sir.

02:06.141 --> 02:07.840
Look at him,
Mr. Dark Good-looking

02:07.842 --> 02:10.342
with Aftershave Ad, huh?

02:10.345 --> 02:11.311
Look at my daughter,

02:11.313 --> 02:12.946
like pierogi,
my little dumpling.

02:12.948 --> 02:14.948
Mr. Mazurski.
You tell me

02:14.950 --> 02:17.116
he is marrying her for love
and the love-making.

02:17.118 --> 02:19.285
You know what, that's enough.
Walk away.

02:19.287 --> 02:21.587
Now!

02:21.589 --> 02:22.722
Hey!

02:22.724 --> 02:24.257
Hey, hey!
You walk away now!

02:25.626 --> 02:26.893
Are you guys okay?
Sir, would you like

02:26.895 --> 02:28.594
to press charges?
No.

02:28.596 --> 02:29.996
I wanted to ask for
Kasia's hand in marriage,

02:29.998 --> 02:31.564
and then he went crazy.

02:31.566 --> 02:33.266
You have to understand.

02:33.268 --> 02:36.402
Baltazar goes out of status
at midnight Sunday.

02:36.404 --> 02:39.172
If we are not married
by 5:00 Friday...

02:39.174 --> 02:40.606
I am toasted.

02:40.608 --> 02:42.175
Toast.

02:42.177 --> 02:44.577
I'm a Syrian national

02:44.579 --> 02:46.579
and on every watch list
there is.

02:46.581 --> 02:48.848
The moment I'm out of status,
my student visa...

02:48.850 --> 02:50.917
Done.

02:50.919 --> 02:52.085
Okay, we're sorry, guys.

02:52.087 --> 02:53.052
We're-we're not immigration.

02:53.054 --> 02:54.721
We're NYPD, so...
We know that.

02:54.723 --> 02:56.823
But we have finished
all our interviews.

02:56.825 --> 03:00.126
We have scheduled the final one
for this Friday at 3:00,

03:00.128 --> 03:01.694
but my father, he
will go down there

03:01.696 --> 03:04.063
and accuse us of fraud marriage.

03:04.065 --> 03:06.165
Are you two hiding anything?

03:06.167 --> 03:07.700
No.

03:07.702 --> 03:09.335
Okay, we don't have
any authority in this,

03:09.337 --> 03:10.703
you understand?

03:12.172 --> 03:13.673
If he gives you
any more trouble,

03:13.675 --> 03:14.974
call the cell number.

03:14.976 --> 03:17.043
That's it?

03:17.045 --> 03:18.978
A phone number?

03:18.980 --> 03:21.314
I'm sorry.

03:21.316 --> 03:23.583
It's an immigration issue, okay?

03:23.585 --> 03:25.385
Good luck

03:25.387 --> 03:26.786
to both of you.

03:26.788 --> 03:28.721
Good luck.

03:31.225 --> 03:32.358
I feel horrible.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.960
Nothing we can do.

03:33.962 --> 03:35.728
Which makes me feel even worse.

03:35.730 --> 03:37.730
Their hearts will go on.

03:37.732 --> 03:39.899
Thank you, Celine Dion.

03:45.239 --> 03:48.174
And while this may seem
like counterintuitive advice

03:48.176 --> 03:49.409
coming from me,

03:49.411 --> 03:52.478
on this day
and to this audience,

03:52.480 --> 03:54.514
here it is.

03:54.516 --> 03:56.149
Don't be a hero.

03:56.151 --> 03:59.986
The odds are there won't be
a medal and a parade.

03:59.988 --> 04:02.555
The odds are...

04:02.557 --> 04:04.557
that you'll end up dead,

04:04.559 --> 04:07.593
to tears instead of cheers,

04:07.595 --> 04:08.928
gone

04:08.930 --> 04:10.663
in a foolhardy instant

04:10.665 --> 04:12.665
from our comrade in arms

04:12.667 --> 04:14.500
to a name

04:14.502 --> 04:17.136
on a plaque on a wall.

04:20.574 --> 04:22.375
What?

04:24.078 --> 04:26.612
Uh...
Um...

04:26.614 --> 04:28.581
They're graduating
the police academy.

04:28.583 --> 04:30.283
They're about to hit
the streets.

04:30.285 --> 04:33.553
You give that speech, they may
just sneak out the back door.

04:33.555 --> 04:35.088
Well, I won't give them pap

04:35.090 --> 04:37.957
like service and duty
and a grateful public.

04:37.959 --> 04:40.059
Maybe just temper
it a little.

04:40.061 --> 04:41.661
Throw them a bone.

04:41.663 --> 04:43.196
I wish just once along the line

04:43.198 --> 04:46.099
the bosses would've talked to us
like they actually gave a hoot,

04:46.101 --> 04:50.169
and not like they were bucking
for an acre on the op-ed page.

05:00.314 --> 05:03.349
You're dismissed.

05:12.193 --> 05:14.060
Did anyone see her fall

05:14.062 --> 05:16.262
or did you see anyone visit
her apartment last night?

05:16.264 --> 05:18.064
No.
How about leaving?

05:18.066 --> 05:20.766
No, nothing since I came on
at 5:00.

05:20.768 --> 05:21.968
Did you know
Ms. Clayton, Sergio?

05:21.970 --> 05:23.870
Sure, she was a nice lady.

05:23.872 --> 05:25.771
Knew all our names
even though she was here

05:25.773 --> 05:27.807
only once or twice a week.

05:27.809 --> 05:29.709
She didn't live here full-time?

05:29.711 --> 05:31.911
No, she used it, uh,
peed-a-something.

05:31.913 --> 05:33.146
Pi-à-terre.
That's it, yeah.

05:33.148 --> 05:35.448
I think she lived over in Jersey
the rest of the time.

05:35.450 --> 05:36.682
Look, I got to get back
to the desk.

05:36.684 --> 05:37.850
I can hear all the units
buzzing me.

05:37.852 --> 05:39.118
Uh-uh, this trumps that.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.654
Well, I told the other
detectives everything I know.

05:41.656 --> 05:42.655
Why don't you ask them?

05:42.657 --> 05:44.123
The other detectives?

05:44.125 --> 05:45.992
Yeah, the ones in her apartment.

05:52.866 --> 05:55.101
They're upstairs, Detective.
All right.

05:59.306 --> 06:02.008
Well, look
what the cat dragged in.

06:02.010 --> 06:03.976
We got this, Reagan.

06:03.978 --> 06:06.913
Walt Finney,
forgotten but not gone.

06:06.915 --> 06:07.980
Working for the DA's

06:07.982 --> 06:10.349
investigation squad now.

06:10.351 --> 06:11.784
And this one's ours.

06:11.786 --> 06:13.452
Congratulations.

06:13.454 --> 06:14.854
This is Investigator Bangs.

06:14.856 --> 06:15.955
Nice to meet you.

06:15.957 --> 06:17.857
My partner, Detective Baez.

06:17.859 --> 06:18.891
Nice to meet you.

06:18.893 --> 06:20.693
Walt here used to
work the gang unit.

06:20.695 --> 06:22.728
All the bangers
up in Washington Heights

06:22.730 --> 06:24.263
used to chip in

06:24.265 --> 06:26.632
and get a birthday present
for good old Uncle Walt.

06:28.602 --> 06:30.303
That a gold shield, Reagan?

06:32.506 --> 06:34.106
You steal that
off of Daddy's dresser?

06:34.108 --> 06:35.474
That supposed to be funny?

06:35.476 --> 06:38.311
Okay, guys, let's put them
back in our pants.

06:40.347 --> 06:42.582
What's going on here?

06:42.584 --> 06:43.816
The deceased was
a valuable asset

06:43.818 --> 06:46.152
in an ongoing
DA's office investigation.

06:46.154 --> 06:47.320
I don't know who got
the wires crossed,

06:47.322 --> 06:49.488
but if you call your office,

06:49.490 --> 06:50.957
you'll find your work
is done here.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.358
We'll forward you

06:52.360 --> 06:54.460
copies of our paperwork.

06:55.295 --> 06:57.263
Guess it is what it is.

06:57.265 --> 06:59.498
I just got to use
the ladies' room.

07:02.904 --> 07:04.670
You can go after her.

07:06.808 --> 07:07.907
See you around, Finney.

07:07.909 --> 07:08.975
You, too, Bangs.

07:08.977 --> 07:10.343
Not if I see you first.

07:10.345 --> 07:11.944
Whatever.

07:12.746 --> 07:14.680
You find anything?

07:14.682 --> 07:16.115
The bathroom was wired

07:16.117 --> 07:17.250
for video.

07:17.252 --> 07:19.352
I assume
the other rooms were, too.

07:19.354 --> 07:21.487
This must have dropped out
in their hurry.

07:21.489 --> 07:23.889
I found it behind the john.
It's a camera.

07:23.891 --> 07:25.992
They must have had some kind
of sting going or something.

07:25.994 --> 07:27.059
That went bad.

07:27.061 --> 07:28.427
Well, we don't
know it went bad.

07:28.429 --> 07:30.196
Uh, you're running a sting
and your lead actor

07:30.198 --> 07:32.932
jumps off a building,
I'd call that bad.

07:32.934 --> 07:34.367
You got a point.

07:34.369 --> 07:36.669
Wonder what the hell
they're trying to find.

07:36.671 --> 07:38.604
And that Finney seems like
the kind of guy

07:38.606 --> 07:40.906
you want around when you don't
want to get your hands dirty.

07:40.908 --> 07:42.742
That's exactly what Finney is.

07:42.744 --> 07:45.444
So who's trying not to get
their hands dirty here?

07:47.081 --> 07:49.048
That's a good question.

08:26.459 --> 08:27.659
What do you have on this, Dino?

08:27.661 --> 08:29.427
A personal tragedy.

08:29.429 --> 08:31.429
That's it?

08:31.431 --> 08:34.499
That's it so far
as the press is concerned.

08:34.501 --> 08:35.767
Great.

08:35.769 --> 08:37.068
I'll let you tell them that.

08:37.070 --> 08:38.602
Dino?

08:38.605 --> 08:40.605
The deceased, one Ilene Clayton,

08:40.607 --> 08:42.807
was cooperating
in an ongoing investigation

08:42.808 --> 08:44.542
by the Manhattan DA's office.

08:44.544 --> 08:46.144
They request that
we defer to them

08:46.146 --> 08:47.779
regarding the suicide
investigation

08:47.781 --> 08:49.847
due to its sensitive nature.

08:49.849 --> 08:51.683
Anybody here consider

08:51.685 --> 08:53.051
themselves sensitive?

08:54.688 --> 08:57.422
I think we can handle
the gory details.

08:57.424 --> 09:00.692
They'd let her skate on charges
of promoting prostitution

09:00.694 --> 09:02.293
in exchange for her cooperation

09:02.295 --> 09:04.862
snaring the johns in a sting.

09:04.864 --> 09:06.564
Who got stung?
I don't know

09:06.566 --> 09:09.033
the outcome.
I don't know there is one.

09:10.269 --> 09:12.503
So she's
a confidential informant,

09:12.505 --> 09:14.038
duly registered?

09:14.040 --> 09:15.239
I believe so,

09:15.241 --> 09:16.708
yes.

09:16.710 --> 09:17.842
Find out.

09:17.844 --> 09:19.544
Yes, sir.

09:19.546 --> 09:21.612
You know why
I don't like suicides?

09:21.614 --> 09:24.615
Because they are,
by their very nature, chaotic,

09:24.617 --> 09:27.285
an act that throws
all the orbits out of whack

09:27.287 --> 09:29.020
and begs a million questions.

09:29.022 --> 09:31.055
Yes.
And many of those

09:31.057 --> 09:34.592
million questions will be
directed squarely at us,

09:34.594 --> 09:36.160
and I don't want to be left

09:36.162 --> 09:37.862
standing there,
twisting in the wind.

09:37.864 --> 09:40.231
Drill down on this right away.

09:40.233 --> 09:41.699
Yes, sir.

09:43.936 --> 09:47.271
Chief Wallace, unpack
the president's visit for us.

09:51.043 --> 09:54.145
<i>It says here the jumper</i>
<i>was indicted 11 months ago</i>

09:54.147 --> 09:55.446
on a variety of charges

09:55.448 --> 09:56.914
related
to promoting prostitution

09:56.916 --> 09:59.150
by the Manhattan DA's office,
but according to the record,

09:59.152 --> 10:01.486
she never entered a plea,
never went to trial, nothing.

10:01.488 --> 10:02.954
Just drops off the map.

10:02.956 --> 10:05.356
Which would be consistent
with them flipping her

10:05.358 --> 10:07.525
in exchange for no jail time.

10:07.527 --> 10:08.793
Right, but in Atlantic City,
she was convicted

10:08.795 --> 10:10.528
on a similar set of
charges and entered

10:10.530 --> 10:13.197
the Edna Mahan Women's Facility
six months ago.

10:13.199 --> 10:14.599
For how long?

10:14.601 --> 10:15.967
Three to five.

10:15.969 --> 10:17.168
But she walked?

10:17.170 --> 10:19.404
No, she was sprung
after the fact.

10:19.406 --> 10:22.273
Why waste that much juice
to keep one madam in business?

10:22.275 --> 10:25.276
Reagan, Baez,
put it on the shelf.

10:25.278 --> 10:27.011
Put what on the shelf?

10:27.013 --> 10:28.846
The jumper; she belongs
to the DA's office.

10:28.848 --> 10:30.214
Says the DA's office.

10:30.216 --> 10:33.818
Says One PP
in no uncertain terms.

10:33.820 --> 10:35.586
One PP?

10:37.756 --> 10:39.390
Huh.
Where are you going?

10:39.392 --> 10:40.725
I'm gonna go see my sister.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.093
He just said to drop it.

10:42.095 --> 10:44.695
Yeah, well, maybe this can
of worms opens from the inside.

10:44.697 --> 10:46.164
Reagan!

10:46.166 --> 10:48.800
Don't worry about me.

10:48.802 --> 10:50.802
Okay, the one
with the photos in it...

10:50.804 --> 10:52.837
Erin, wait up!

10:52.839 --> 10:55.073
Hi.
Hey, you got a minute?

10:55.075 --> 10:56.641
No, I'm late for court as it is.

10:56.643 --> 10:58.543
I got to go.
One minute?

10:59.946 --> 11:02.413
I'll be right in, Richard.

11:04.650 --> 11:06.684
Yeah?

11:06.686 --> 11:08.853
What can you tell me
about Ilene Clayton?

11:10.623 --> 11:12.590
That the circumstances
around her tragic death

11:12.592 --> 11:14.358
are being looked into
by our office.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.427
Wow, you had that
memorized perfectly.

11:16.429 --> 11:17.462
Danny,

11:17.464 --> 11:19.030
apparently some wires
were crossed

11:19.032 --> 11:20.131
when it was called in.

11:20.133 --> 11:21.432
I wouldn't read
anything into it.

11:21.434 --> 11:22.767
Well, you see,
that's the problem.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.535
That's my job, you know,
to read into stuff.

11:24.537 --> 11:26.504
Not in this instance, okay?

11:26.506 --> 11:28.139
And shoe on the other foot?
If I was snooping around the death

11:28.141 --> 11:29.607
of one of your CIs, you'd what?

11:29.609 --> 11:31.609
I'd listen to you.
You'd kick me out.

11:31.611 --> 11:33.578
No, you're my sister,
you know, I'd...

11:33.580 --> 11:34.979
Kick me out nicely.

11:34.981 --> 11:38.249
Okay?
I gotta go.

11:46.292 --> 11:47.358
Come on.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.560
Bitch!

11:50.963 --> 11:52.463
Need some help,
Detective?

11:52.465 --> 11:53.664
Nah, I'm good.

11:53.666 --> 11:55.900
NYPD cheaping
out on tires?

11:57.803 --> 11:59.504
Actually, this was slashed.

11:59.506 --> 12:01.205
The nerve, huh?
Funny thing, though.

12:01.207 --> 12:02.907
You don't usually see that,

12:02.909 --> 12:04.775
just the one car, you know?
It's usually

12:04.777 --> 12:06.677
a whole row of cars,
tire gets slashed.

12:06.679 --> 12:07.745
You know what I mean?

12:07.747 --> 12:10.181
Yeah. You mean like a pattern.

12:10.183 --> 12:11.415
Yeah.

12:11.417 --> 12:12.984
It's almost like a child did it,
you know,

12:12.986 --> 12:14.585
just to stick it to me
personally.

12:14.587 --> 12:16.621
How you know it was a child?

12:16.623 --> 12:18.189
Maybe 'cause I'm looking at one.

12:18.191 --> 12:19.690
I mean, who else besides a child

12:19.692 --> 12:21.058
like you would
be dumb enough

12:21.060 --> 12:22.860
to do something like that,
huh, Walt?

12:22.862 --> 12:23.728
Oh, you gonna get out?

12:23.730 --> 12:25.062
Come on.
Walt...

12:25.064 --> 12:26.197
Come on.

12:26.199 --> 12:27.331
Come on, Walt,
come on.

12:27.333 --> 12:28.499
Close the damn door!

12:33.505 --> 12:34.672
Yeah, run along.

12:36.742 --> 12:39.510
I'll see you again, Reagan.

12:39.512 --> 12:41.145
Yeah, I'm sure
you will.

12:50.155 --> 12:52.323
What?

12:57.664 --> 12:59.697
You looking for me, Sarge?

12:59.699 --> 13:02.667
Yeah.

13:02.669 --> 13:04.835
The DA's office filed
a complaint against you.

13:04.837 --> 13:06.103
For what?

13:06.105 --> 13:08.072
Harassing their investigators.

13:08.074 --> 13:10.241
Come on, that's B.S., Sarge.
Yeah, well,

13:10.243 --> 13:11.642
they made it official

13:11.644 --> 13:13.578
and pressed the complaint.
What?

13:13.580 --> 13:14.645
Can I see
this complaint?

13:14.647 --> 13:16.013
I don't have it.

13:16.015 --> 13:17.782
It went straight to One PP.

13:17.784 --> 13:19.750
Sarge... harassing
an investigator,

13:19.752 --> 13:20.885
that's crazy, okay?

13:20.887 --> 13:22.386
This guy, he slashed my tire.

13:22.388 --> 13:23.754
Did you see him do it?

13:23.756 --> 13:25.056
I didn't have to see him do it!

13:25.058 --> 13:27.959
Your shield
and your gun.

13:27.961 --> 13:29.260
For what?

13:29.262 --> 13:30.828
You've been placed
on modified assignment

13:30.830 --> 13:32.129
while the claims
are looked into.

13:32.131 --> 13:33.364
Sarge, come on.

13:33.366 --> 13:35.967
This is obvious.

13:35.969 --> 13:38.469
Somebody's running
a railroad here!

13:43.208 --> 13:45.443
Detective,
don't make this worse.

13:45.445 --> 13:48.179
Your shield and your gun.

14:23.309 --> 14:24.309
Hi.

14:24.311 --> 14:26.211
Hey. What can I do for you?

14:26.213 --> 14:28.013
Do you happen to know
who filed the complaint

14:28.015 --> 14:29.414
against Detective Reagan?

14:29.416 --> 14:31.083
Yeah. I did.

14:31.918 --> 14:33.285
For...?

14:33.287 --> 14:34.786
Good reason.

14:35.822 --> 14:36.955
For...?

14:36.957 --> 14:38.957
For interfering with
an ongoing investigation

14:38.959 --> 14:41.827
and the verbal abuse
of two of our investigators.

14:41.829 --> 14:44.463
I can't imagine whatever he did

14:44.465 --> 14:46.498
merited a formal complaint.

14:47.834 --> 14:49.468
Erin, did he come to you

14:49.470 --> 14:52.104
and ask you to look into
the Ilene Clayton suicide?

14:54.007 --> 14:56.208
And did you bring it to me?

14:56.210 --> 14:59.878
Amanda, it was just
Danny being Danny.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.280
Erin, I appreciate
he's your brother,

15:01.282 --> 15:03.348
and I truly am sorry
for the mark on his record.

15:03.350 --> 15:04.883
But I can't
afford

15:04.885 --> 15:07.386
to buy into the "family
business" aspect of your life

15:07.388 --> 15:09.087
on this.
I'm sorry.

15:09.089 --> 15:10.322
It's just too big a case,

15:10.324 --> 15:12.691
and in any case,
there are boundaries

15:12.693 --> 15:14.593
to be honored and observed.

15:18.231 --> 15:20.132
I understand. Right.

15:20.134 --> 15:21.133
Okay.

15:21.135 --> 15:22.734
Let me buy you lunch.

15:22.736 --> 15:24.603
No, I'm swamped, uh,

15:24.605 --> 15:26.438
I should just get
something at my desk.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.273
The soup of the day

15:28.275 --> 15:31.009
is the lowdown on the sting.

15:31.011 --> 15:33.178
Come on.

15:40.486 --> 15:41.520
Hey, Dino.

15:41.522 --> 15:43.055
Sit.

15:44.324 --> 15:47.059
First of all, thank you for
not giving me a heads-up

15:47.061 --> 15:50.262
about the complaint
on Detective Reagan.

15:50.264 --> 15:51.697
Boss, I'm sorry.
No, I mean it.

15:51.699 --> 15:54.032
I finally found
someone in this building

15:54.034 --> 15:55.867
who is willing
to respect my wishes

15:55.869 --> 15:57.269
regarding my sons.

15:57.271 --> 15:59.071
You're welcome.

15:59.073 --> 16:00.339
The suicide...

16:00.341 --> 16:02.040
Is unconnected to

16:02.042 --> 16:03.375
the DA's criminal investigation.

16:03.377 --> 16:05.711
Which is what, exactly?

16:05.713 --> 16:08.013
A sting operation,
being conducted in cooperation

16:08.015 --> 16:09.381
with the Essex County

16:09.383 --> 16:11.750
prosecutor's office.
Ms. Clayton

16:11.752 --> 16:12.851
has a record in Jersey

16:12.853 --> 16:14.186
for promoting prostitution.

16:14.188 --> 16:15.887
So some kind of gotcha?

16:15.889 --> 16:18.090
Everything about
it is sealed.

16:18.092 --> 16:20.459
My crowbar's not that big.

16:20.461 --> 16:22.327
And how long
has this been going on?

16:22.329 --> 16:23.762
I don't have
that, either.

16:23.764 --> 16:25.464
The DA's office is treating this

16:25.466 --> 16:26.631
like it's a surprise party

16:26.633 --> 16:28.266
and even the
date is a secret.

16:28.268 --> 16:29.768
Just between you and me,

16:29.770 --> 16:32.170
I got no appetite for
this kind of scavenger hunt.

16:32.172 --> 16:33.939
A lot of time and resources

16:33.941 --> 16:36.575
being devoted to
catching a bunch of guys

16:36.577 --> 16:37.843
with their pants down.

16:37.845 --> 16:40.278
In the scheme of things,
it's a big "so what?"

16:41.415 --> 16:43.115
What?

16:43.117 --> 16:45.751
Nothing, I just...

16:45.753 --> 16:48.220
your being a devout Catholic
and all...

16:49.689 --> 16:52.090
"Let he who is
without sin among you

16:52.092 --> 16:53.225
cast the first stone."

16:53.227 --> 16:55.660
If I had a motto,
that would be it.

16:55.662 --> 16:57.763
Keep me posted, Dino.

17:03.036 --> 17:04.569
<i>My turn to pick Happy Hour.</i>

17:04.570 --> 17:06.204
Been your pick
the last two weeks.

17:06.205 --> 17:07.672
Yeah, and we've
eaten like kings.

17:07.674 --> 17:10.075
Kings don't eat Buffalo wings
and fried mozzarella sticks.

17:10.077 --> 17:11.877
Okay, JP
Funkhouser's has

17:11.878 --> 17:13.178
franks in blankets
on Wednesday nights.

17:13.180 --> 17:14.479
Mmm.
Done and doner.

17:14.481 --> 17:16.781
I need to speak
to Officer Janko!

17:16.784 --> 17:18.483
Oh. Incoming...
Move!

17:18.484 --> 17:20.117
Move!

17:20.119 --> 17:21.319
What now, Ms. Mazurski?

17:21.320 --> 17:23.088
He is hiding my papers.

17:23.089 --> 17:24.823
Your father?
Yes.

17:24.825 --> 17:27.559
Baltazar and me cannot get
CIS approval to marry

17:27.560 --> 17:29.895
without I have
original documents.

17:29.897 --> 17:31.830
Are you sure
that he has them?

17:31.832 --> 17:33.532
Yes, I gave them to him,

17:33.534 --> 17:35.033
he said for safekeeping.

17:35.035 --> 17:36.401
And now he won't
give them back.

17:36.403 --> 17:38.069
Kasia, calm down.
Okay? Calm down.

17:38.071 --> 17:40.071
You want a cup
of coffee?

17:40.073 --> 17:42.340
I want to marry
Baltazar.

17:43.976 --> 17:45.177
Okay, s-sit down.

17:47.447 --> 17:49.381
Uh, Kasia,

17:49.383 --> 17:50.649
are you over 18 years old?

17:50.651 --> 17:52.017
Yes.
Okay,

17:52.019 --> 17:53.685
then those documents
are legally yours.

17:53.687 --> 17:55.353
But we can't
help you unless

17:55.355 --> 17:57.055
you agree to press charges
against your father

17:57.057 --> 17:59.097
for grand larceny and
possession of stolen property.

18:00.426 --> 18:01.660
Me against my own father?

18:01.662 --> 18:02.928
Yeah, then
we can

18:02.930 --> 18:04.830
apply for a warrant
to search for the documents.

18:04.832 --> 18:07.399
What kind of daughter
is doing this?

18:10.403 --> 18:11.703
Kasia,

18:11.705 --> 18:14.005
do you want to sleep on it?

18:16.309 --> 18:19.644
All the sleep in the world,

18:19.646 --> 18:22.347
I can't have
my own father arrested.

18:33.392 --> 18:34.292
Reagan.

18:34.294 --> 18:35.327
Hey.

18:35.329 --> 18:38.463
Meet me at Puddings,
64th and First.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.499
The doorman from Ilene Clayton's
building wants to talk.

18:40.501 --> 18:41.600
Wants,
or will?

18:41.602 --> 18:42.534
Doesn't matter.

18:42.536 --> 18:43.835
Just get over here?

18:43.837 --> 18:45.203
I'm on my way.

18:46.706 --> 18:49.007
We get the call over
the air from Central

18:49.009 --> 18:50.675
to pick him up for
the warrant squad.

18:50.677 --> 18:52.811
That's all she wrote,
Detective...

18:52.813 --> 18:53.979
Hey!

18:55.315 --> 18:56.515
What's
going on?

18:56.517 --> 18:58.183
Where are you taking him?
Did you get

18:58.185 --> 19:00.085
anything out of him?
There were three girls

19:00.087 --> 19:01.720
who used the apartment,
two nights a week each,

19:01.722 --> 19:03.221
and the men usually came
in different shifts.

19:03.223 --> 19:05.090
So, did he recognize
any of the girls?

19:05.092 --> 19:07.125
No, he only ever saw them
on the monitors.

19:07.127 --> 19:09.261
They buzzed the johns in
through the service entrance.

19:09.263 --> 19:10.962
Look,
I played Sergio.

19:10.964 --> 19:13.131
I got him to talk
because I dug up

19:13.133 --> 19:14.633
that he had some
outstanding warrants

19:14.635 --> 19:16.768
on him out
of Florida.

19:16.770 --> 19:18.470
The warrants are still active,
but he didn't know

19:18.472 --> 19:20.171
they won't extradite out of Florida.
Yeah.

19:20.173 --> 19:21.473
Right.

19:21.475 --> 19:23.141
But the warrant squad
would know that.

19:24.343 --> 19:25.577
So they wouldn't send a guy down

19:25.579 --> 19:28.647
to pick up a dead warrant,
would they?

19:28.649 --> 19:29.948
That means

19:29.950 --> 19:32.117
somebody on the inside
at the NYPD

19:32.119 --> 19:34.052
is pulling the strings
to keep this guy quiet.

19:34.054 --> 19:35.487
He's being watched.

19:35.489 --> 19:37.489
Yeah, or we are.

19:45.331 --> 19:46.298
Evening, Detective.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.365
The detective is on

19:47.367 --> 19:48.767
modified assignment.

19:48.769 --> 19:50.502
This is a citizen
with an anonymous tip.

19:50.504 --> 19:51.703
You want it?

19:53.072 --> 19:54.773
How good's the source?

19:54.775 --> 19:55.941
It's good.

19:55.943 --> 19:57.642
You want it?

19:57.644 --> 19:59.844
Go ahead.

20:04.016 --> 20:05.317
Like I said,

20:05.319 --> 20:07.185
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

20:07.187 --> 20:10.789
I doubt you've "just
happened to be" anywhere, ever.

20:10.791 --> 20:12.924
I need a
small favor.

20:12.926 --> 20:14.125
That's more like it.

20:14.127 --> 20:16.661
A woman jumped
off her building,

20:16.663 --> 20:19.631
a high-end madam
connected to a case

20:19.633 --> 20:21.533
that the district
attorney's office

20:21.535 --> 20:25.036
is building against
her big-name clients.

20:25.038 --> 20:26.871
Elected officials?

20:26.873 --> 20:28.073
Likely.

20:28.075 --> 20:29.307
I don't have
any names.

20:29.309 --> 20:30.976
But you do
have a daughter

20:30.978 --> 20:33.111
who's pretty high up
in the DA's office.

20:33.113 --> 20:34.112
Yeah, so she's
hands-off.

20:34.114 --> 20:35.280
And a son

20:35.282 --> 20:37.148
who stuck
his nose in

20:37.150 --> 20:38.583
and caught
a complaint,

20:38.585 --> 20:41.286
and a Chief of Department
who can't seem

20:41.288 --> 20:43.321
to peek through
the iron curtain

20:43.323 --> 20:44.889
that's come down
around it.

20:44.891 --> 20:47.158
And you want me
to... what?

20:47.160 --> 20:51.563
Well, apparently
the investigation

20:51.565 --> 20:54.032
is a joint effort
with your old pals

20:54.034 --> 20:56.234
at the Essex County
prosecutor's office.

20:58.104 --> 21:00.905
I have reason to
think that somebody

21:00.907 --> 21:02.407
in my department

21:02.409 --> 21:05.543
is covertly
involved as well.

21:07.179 --> 21:08.913
You want to know
who's in her black book.

21:08.915 --> 21:10.749
Yes. I don't want
to be blindsided.

21:10.751 --> 21:12.651
Or have a friend
blindsided?

21:12.653 --> 21:13.718
I don't have
any friends.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.920
A few allies,

21:15.922 --> 21:17.789
but they're all on
the barter system.

21:17.791 --> 21:20.558
And I don't have any agenda

21:20.560 --> 21:22.827
other than having
the information.

21:22.829 --> 21:24.963
Frank...

21:24.965 --> 21:27.399
is there a possibility
you're in her book?

21:29.201 --> 21:30.902
You know I
have to ask.

21:30.904 --> 21:32.570
Yes.

21:32.572 --> 21:34.506
And no...

21:34.508 --> 21:36.207
I couldn't
be in it.

21:38.177 --> 21:39.978
Okay.

21:43.082 --> 21:44.949
Why do you still wear
your wedding ring?

21:46.919 --> 21:48.987
Let's forget we had
this conversation.

21:48.989 --> 21:51.723
As you wish,
Commissioner.

21:53.225 --> 21:55.527
I don't know,
exactly.

21:55.529 --> 21:57.028
I guess...

21:57.030 --> 22:00.465
I've just never had
the moment where...

22:00.467 --> 22:03.334
I felt compelled
to take it off.

22:05.806 --> 22:08.606
Did you let her see the gaps
in your armor?

22:08.608 --> 22:10.075
Like your

22:10.077 --> 22:12.844
petty side or the bully in you?

22:12.846 --> 22:14.579
And that bleeding heart

22:14.581 --> 22:17.582
you're so deathly afraid
will get exposed?

22:17.584 --> 22:21.553
You can't replace her
the way you're trying to, Frank.

22:23.522 --> 22:26.825
You're a father to your kids
and a son to your father

22:26.827 --> 22:28.293
and a boss

22:28.295 --> 22:29.994
to your men.

22:29.996 --> 22:33.398
They can't be
that person for you.

22:36.669 --> 22:39.137
I'm not looking
to replace anybody.

22:41.741 --> 22:43.942
This is me.

22:45.644 --> 22:47.679
And don't worry.

22:47.681 --> 22:50.148
I'm not throwing my hat
in the ring.

22:50.150 --> 22:52.617
I'm speaking to you as...

22:52.619 --> 22:55.420
as a friend.

22:56.956 --> 22:59.157
Thank you.

23:01.260 --> 23:04.028
I'll see what I can dig up.

23:04.030 --> 23:06.498
I'll see you, Frank.

23:22.626 --> 23:25.195
Biggest cup of your
strongest roast you got today.

23:25.197 --> 23:27.764
Rough night?

23:27.766 --> 23:29.265
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

23:29.267 --> 23:30.600
Poor Kasia.

23:30.602 --> 23:33.136
She's just, you know,
she's breaking my heart.

23:33.138 --> 23:34.737
Thank you.

23:34.739 --> 23:36.306
Is she not breaking your heart?

23:36.308 --> 23:38.141
No.

23:38.143 --> 23:40.577
She is trying to marry
her true love,

23:40.579 --> 23:43.947
but that old-country,
last-century, Polish,

23:43.949 --> 23:46.983
patriarchal crap
is trying to squash her soul,

23:46.985 --> 23:49.452
and succeeding, you know?

23:49.454 --> 23:51.154
It's literally a tragedy.

23:51.156 --> 23:52.622
You don't see that?

23:52.624 --> 23:54.691
No, I see it, it's just
not breaking my heart.

23:54.693 --> 23:56.125
Why not?

23:56.127 --> 23:58.228
Well, first of all,
Dad's got a point.

23:58.230 --> 23:59.562
There's something
fishy going on there.

23:59.564 --> 24:01.064
Why?

24:01.066 --> 24:02.398
Because she's not
as traditionally good-looking

24:02.400 --> 24:03.566
as he is?

24:03.568 --> 24:05.001
That makes it fishy?

24:05.003 --> 24:06.035
Kind of.

24:06.037 --> 24:08.204
Are you really
that shallow, Reagan?

24:08.206 --> 24:10.473
You are as backwards
as her old man.

24:10.475 --> 24:12.408
No, not really.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.743
I'm just a realist,
that's all.

24:13.745 --> 24:14.844
A lot of cowardice

24:14.846 --> 24:16.312
hiding behind "realist"
in my experience.

24:16.314 --> 24:17.881
All right.
You know, hold this.

24:17.883 --> 24:20.283
Who are you...
Who are you calling?

24:20.285 --> 24:22.185
Kasia. I gave her my card.

24:22.187 --> 24:23.319
We were texting last night.

24:23.321 --> 24:24.587
Just stay out of it, Eddie.

24:24.589 --> 24:27.290
Some situations call
for a hero, Reagan,

24:27.292 --> 24:28.858
and this is one of them.

24:29.727 --> 24:32.395
Kasia, it's Officer Janko.

24:38.135 --> 24:39.636
You needed to see me a minute?

24:39.638 --> 24:40.737
Yes, thanks.

24:40.739 --> 24:42.238
Uh, please sit.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.173
Okay, a minute's all I've got.

24:44.175 --> 24:45.708
It's a lot of material,

24:45.710 --> 24:48.211
but I think I have
a pretty good grasp of the case.

24:48.213 --> 24:50.046
Good.

24:50.048 --> 24:51.347
And some concerns.

24:51.349 --> 24:55.051
Um, the warrants
for the surveillance cameras

24:55.053 --> 24:57.787
on the Clayton apartment
date back four months.

24:57.789 --> 24:59.822
Well, yeah, it's a sting.

24:59.824 --> 25:01.791
You can't predict
when the job's going to be done.

25:01.793 --> 25:04.994
No, but the warrants are
for 30 days each.

25:04.996 --> 25:06.095
And each subsequent warrant,

25:06.097 --> 25:08.131
two to four,

25:08.133 --> 25:11.167
are signed off
by different judges. Why?

25:11.169 --> 25:13.136
Confidentiality.

25:13.138 --> 25:15.471
From whom?
From whom?

25:15.473 --> 25:18.074
From any one judge getting
a sense of the scope of this

25:18.076 --> 25:19.375
and tipping it off.

25:19.377 --> 25:20.810
These guys

25:20.812 --> 25:22.612
do intersect with each other.

25:22.614 --> 25:24.547
They look out
for each other's interests.

25:24.549 --> 25:26.049
The judges and the targets?

25:26.051 --> 25:27.784
Some of them, of course.

25:27.786 --> 25:30.653
Okay, um, say that's true...

25:30.655 --> 25:32.055
It is true.

25:34.558 --> 25:36.359
Okay, Amanda, uh,

25:36.361 --> 25:38.227
looking this over,

25:38.229 --> 25:40.563
it doesn't track
as a targeted sting.

25:40.565 --> 25:42.699
It does
if you read it correctly.

25:42.701 --> 25:45.568
You kept applying
to different judges,

25:45.570 --> 25:46.803
four of them,

25:46.805 --> 25:48.805
and as far as I can see,
none of them

25:48.807 --> 25:50.406
were aware
of the previous warrants

25:50.408 --> 25:51.841
on the same
surveillance operation.

25:51.843 --> 25:53.810
Are you worried
I don't know what I'm doing?

25:53.812 --> 25:55.378
I'm worried
about what you are doing.

25:55.380 --> 25:57.647
This reads more
like a hunting license

25:57.649 --> 25:59.382
than a proper investigation.

25:59.384 --> 26:01.851
Well, thank you for your notes.

26:01.853 --> 26:04.220
Amanda, I am on your side.
Yes, you are.

26:04.222 --> 26:06.923
Try to start sounding that way.

26:06.925 --> 26:09.359
But in the hands
of any decent defense attorney,

26:09.361 --> 26:11.461
this is a box of dynamite.

26:11.463 --> 26:14.330
But in my hands,
it's a pot of gold.

26:14.332 --> 26:15.898
I took the warrants

26:15.900 --> 26:17.467
to different judges to protect
the integrity

26:17.469 --> 26:20.169
of the investigation,
as I just explained.

26:20.171 --> 26:22.905
I know it goes without saying,
but I should anyway.

26:22.907 --> 26:25.408
This is a highly confidential
ongoing investigation

26:25.410 --> 26:28.144
by this office to which
you've now been given access.

26:28.146 --> 26:29.479
You invited me in.

26:29.481 --> 26:30.580
A case like this,

26:30.582 --> 26:32.882
you walk in the door,
it locks behind you.

26:32.884 --> 26:33.983
You know that.

26:33.985 --> 26:35.752
You cannot discuss

26:35.754 --> 26:37.053
any of this with anyone.

26:38.390 --> 26:40.990
Okay, I'm walking.

26:40.992 --> 26:42.658
Start talking.

26:45.429 --> 26:46.863
Kasia, you are really
doing this?!

26:46.865 --> 26:48.064
Yes, Tata!

26:48.066 --> 26:49.399
She's not arresting you,
we are.

26:49.401 --> 26:50.533
Your own father?!
Hey, hey.

26:50.535 --> 26:52.301
Knock it off.
Just give me what is mine!

26:52.303 --> 26:53.636
What, so you can be humiliated?
Hey.

26:53.638 --> 26:55.505
What kind of man would do this
to his daughter?

26:55.507 --> 26:58.007
This is your last
chance, Mr. Mazurski.

26:58.009 --> 26:59.175
Do you have Kasia's papers?

26:59.177 --> 27:00.576
Of course I do; I'm her father!

27:00.578 --> 27:03.012
Well, they belong to her,
and if you don't hand them over,

27:03.014 --> 27:04.480
you will be charged
with grand larceny

27:04.482 --> 27:05.581
and possession
of stolen property.

27:05.583 --> 27:06.616
Do you understand that?

27:06.618 --> 27:08.384
You understand that, Kasienka?
Hey.

27:08.386 --> 27:10.019
Hey!
You are sending your father

27:10.021 --> 27:11.687
to prison over this Arab?!

27:11.689 --> 27:12.855
Don't twist words!

27:12.857 --> 27:14.123
I love you, Tata.

27:14.125 --> 27:16.893
Just give me my papers
which belong to me!

27:16.895 --> 27:18.828
But you would really do this?

27:22.099 --> 27:23.866
I give up.

27:26.470 --> 27:28.604
Take handcuffs off, please.

27:41.185 --> 27:43.019
I wish you good luck.

27:49.526 --> 27:50.760
Oh.

27:50.762 --> 27:53.563
Good-bye.

27:58.669 --> 28:00.536
Tata?

28:00.538 --> 28:03.573
Tata, wait!

28:06.176 --> 28:07.777
Oh, sweetheart.

28:07.779 --> 28:09.946
I'm so sorry.

28:24.395 --> 28:26.395
Sorry to make you come up here
in person,

28:26.397 --> 28:30.032
but I thought this should pass
directly between us.

28:30.034 --> 28:32.768
I didn't open it,

28:32.770 --> 28:35.972
but as you can see,
there's a disk inside.

28:35.974 --> 28:37.273
Thank you.

28:37.275 --> 28:39.976
Not sure it's something
you'll thank me for.

28:39.978 --> 28:42.478
Regardless.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.780
Um...

28:44.782 --> 28:46.849
One other thing.

28:46.851 --> 28:48.484
You can consider this

28:48.486 --> 28:50.219
my going-away present.

28:50.221 --> 28:52.255
What do you mean?
Oh, Frank.

28:52.257 --> 28:54.357
Do you really think
I would've rolled on this

28:54.359 --> 28:57.360
and made a call if I didn't have
something else on my agenda?

28:58.930 --> 29:00.296
I'm not following.

29:00.298 --> 29:04.400
For a smart guy,
you can be really...

29:05.369 --> 29:07.203
What's going on?

29:08.972 --> 29:11.841
I'm resigning my position
as Inspector General

29:11.843 --> 29:13.543
over the NYPD

29:13.545 --> 29:15.344
first thing Monday morning.

29:15.346 --> 29:17.847
Because?

29:17.849 --> 29:19.615
Because I believe the job,

29:19.617 --> 29:21.551
at its core,

29:21.553 --> 29:23.886
requires an adversarial attitude

29:23.888 --> 29:26.789
toward the NYPD
and its commissioner.

29:26.791 --> 29:29.458
Or at the very least,

29:29.460 --> 29:31.127
a firm neutrality.

29:31.129 --> 29:34.730
I have failed to maintain that.

29:36.300 --> 29:38.501
Why?

29:39.403 --> 29:42.939
I'm embarrassed to say.

29:42.941 --> 29:45.441
Try.

29:48.845 --> 29:52.982
I need to be Switzerland,

29:52.984 --> 29:54.884
uh, Bushwick,

29:54.886 --> 29:58.054
or wherever the hell it is
you're from.

29:58.056 --> 30:00.122
Bay Ridge.
Bay Ridge.

30:00.124 --> 30:02.291
Then I'm Bay Ridge.

30:04.828 --> 30:06.696
I root for you.

30:08.999 --> 30:10.900
I don't know what to say.

30:10.902 --> 30:13.636
Don't have to say anything.

30:14.972 --> 30:16.272
But you should know that

30:16.274 --> 30:18.307
I'll be recommending
they appoint a successor,

30:18.309 --> 30:20.476
and not vacate the position.

30:20.478 --> 30:23.946
I'll burn that bridge
when I come to it.

30:23.948 --> 30:26.549
I'm sure you will.

30:32.356 --> 30:33.656
Good night, Frank.

30:33.658 --> 30:35.858
Night, Kelly.

31:21.473 --> 31:23.073
Please turn it off.

31:26.377 --> 31:29.513
Was that one
of Ilene Clayton's girls?

31:31.883 --> 31:34.017
Yes.

31:34.019 --> 31:35.852
You pay cash?

31:35.854 --> 31:37.421
No.

31:37.423 --> 31:39.756
It was in consideration
for protection.

31:39.758 --> 31:43.093
Do you want a union rep?

31:43.095 --> 31:45.061
I'm not going to insult you.

31:45.063 --> 31:46.596
A little late for that.

31:48.345 --> 31:50.279
Why'd she jump?

31:50.281 --> 31:51.780
I don't know.

31:51.782 --> 31:53.115
I can guess.

31:53.117 --> 31:54.917
She was a prisoner,

31:54.919 --> 31:56.852
no matter where she slept.

32:03.093 --> 32:05.160
I didn't know
the place was wired.

32:05.162 --> 32:07.129
Obviously.

32:07.131 --> 32:08.797
You were set up?

32:08.799 --> 32:09.999
I got a request

32:10.001 --> 32:11.300
from the DA's office

32:11.302 --> 32:13.035
for our cooperation
on a sting operation

32:13.037 --> 32:14.636
being conducted via Clayton

32:14.638 --> 32:16.472
and her stable

32:17.273 --> 32:20.809
The girl was a thank-you gift.

32:20.811 --> 32:22.711
A sting targeting whom?

32:22.713 --> 32:24.813
Albany House Speaker Sammy Gold.

32:24.815 --> 32:26.248
By?

32:26.250 --> 32:28.017
Amanda Harris,
Manhattan DA's office.

32:28.019 --> 32:30.452
But he stepped down
three months ago.

32:30.454 --> 32:32.588
"Health issues."

32:32.590 --> 32:35.090
So her intended bombshell
turned out to be a dud.

32:35.092 --> 32:37.259
She was still getting
plenty of people on tape.

32:37.261 --> 32:38.727
Big hitters,

32:38.729 --> 32:40.462
a couple of elected officials,

32:40.464 --> 32:43.365
a judge, a hometown
hero ballplayer.

32:43.367 --> 32:45.334
And it turns out me.

32:45.336 --> 32:47.403
She had me.

32:47.405 --> 32:49.605
So she blackmailed you.

32:49.607 --> 32:51.640
To what end?
She got greedy.

32:51.642 --> 32:53.375
She didn't want to kill
the golden goose.

32:53.377 --> 32:56.812
She was compiling a black book
that was like a nuclear arsenal.

32:56.814 --> 32:59.148
She wants her bombshell,
whoever it is,

32:59.150 --> 33:00.682
and if I didn't have her back,

33:00.684 --> 33:02.551
she was gonna stab me in mine

33:02.553 --> 33:05.087
with that... tape.

33:05.089 --> 33:07.656
Did you orchestrate getting

33:07.658 --> 33:10.959
Detective Reagan benched?

33:16.566 --> 33:18.901
When Clayton took a flyer,
everybody scrambled.

33:18.903 --> 33:20.502
It was like you said.

33:20.504 --> 33:22.438
All the orbits
went out of whack.

33:22.440 --> 33:25.374
Amanda was putting
the screws on tight.

33:28.845 --> 33:30.546
Why didn't you come to me, Dino?

33:30.548 --> 33:32.347
Come to you?

33:32.349 --> 33:33.515
How am I gonna do that?

33:33.517 --> 33:35.517
Start with a knock
on my door.

33:35.519 --> 33:37.219
And how the hell
is that supposed to go?

33:37.221 --> 33:39.088
"Hey, Commish,
I'm getting squeezed

33:39.090 --> 33:41.423
"because they got me
on tape getting bound

33:41.425 --> 33:43.358
"and spanked
by a $5,000 hooker.

33:43.360 --> 33:44.560
Can you help a fella out?"

33:44.562 --> 33:47.329
I mean, walk in my shoes!

33:47.331 --> 33:50.766
Would you go to you

33:50.768 --> 33:52.634
with that?

33:57.240 --> 33:58.607
Send him in.

33:58.609 --> 34:00.876
Send who in
if you don't mind me asking?

34:09.985 --> 34:11.853
I took

34:11.856 --> 34:14.223
the liberty of restoring
Detective Reagan

34:14.225 --> 34:16.358
to full duty.

34:16.360 --> 34:17.793
He will take your weapon,

34:17.795 --> 34:20.661
your shield and your I.D.

34:20.664 --> 34:22.464
And then he will take your full

34:22.466 --> 34:24.699
and truthful statement.

34:26.335 --> 34:28.070
Will there be charges?

34:30.572 --> 34:33.074
The one last sliver of hope

34:33.077 --> 34:34.443
that I am holding on to

34:34.445 --> 34:37.179
right now is that
what you've done here

34:37.181 --> 34:39.380
falls under department
guidelines

34:39.382 --> 34:41.917
and not criminal statutes.

34:41.918 --> 34:44.553
Since you no longer work here,

34:44.554 --> 34:48.223
departmental charges
will not be brought.

34:49.324 --> 34:51.527
Thank you.

34:51.529 --> 34:53.262
Detective Baker will accept
your resignation

34:53.264 --> 34:55.931
when you are finished
with Detective Reagan.

34:55.933 --> 34:58.500
For what it's worth, I'm...

34:58.502 --> 35:00.235
sorry.

35:00.237 --> 35:02.804
It's worth nothing right now.

35:21.090 --> 35:24.560
Detective Reagan,
take his statement.

35:24.562 --> 35:27.162
Right this way, Dino.

35:50.621 --> 35:52.821
Enter.

35:56.693 --> 35:59.294
I do feel like I owe you.

35:59.296 --> 36:00.762
For what?

36:00.764 --> 36:02.197
Just the interest
you've taken in me.

36:02.199 --> 36:03.966
Your support.

36:03.968 --> 36:06.468
If I've done anything,
it's for the good of my section.

36:06.470 --> 36:08.270
But thank you, Erin.

36:08.272 --> 36:10.706
So I'm giving you a heads-up.

36:10.708 --> 36:13.008
You're giving me?
Yeah.

36:13.010 --> 36:14.876
Someone leaked
surveillance video

36:14.878 --> 36:16.945
of Chief of Department Arbogast
to my father.

36:16.947 --> 36:18.614
Your father?

36:18.616 --> 36:20.415
There's no line from me to him.

36:20.417 --> 36:22.584
Arbogast gave a statement.

36:22.586 --> 36:24.586
Implicating you
in a blackmail scheme

36:24.588 --> 36:27.222
to keep Clayton's business
up and running.

36:27.224 --> 36:29.224
Unethically, illegally

36:29.226 --> 36:31.560
and for your own benefit.

36:31.562 --> 36:33.428
For my own benefit?

36:33.430 --> 36:34.429
How?

36:34.431 --> 36:36.765
Who you have on tape, Amanda.

36:36.767 --> 36:39.101
How many headlines
are they worth?

36:39.103 --> 36:42.537
You are way off base.

36:42.539 --> 36:46.541
And that clown can make
any statement he wants.

36:46.543 --> 36:48.277
I'll be right here.

36:48.279 --> 36:51.013
But thanks for the heads-up.

36:52.081 --> 36:54.683
I filed a complaint with
the grievance committee

36:54.685 --> 36:55.984
earlier this afternoon

36:55.986 --> 36:57.786
concerning your administration

36:57.788 --> 36:59.421
of this investigation.

36:59.423 --> 37:00.689
Did you now?

37:00.691 --> 37:02.958
Yes, I did.

37:02.960 --> 37:07.095
Oh, you stupid, stupid child.

37:08.131 --> 37:09.331
You idiot.

37:09.333 --> 37:11.300
You abused your power.

37:11.302 --> 37:14.036
You waltzed in here
like a model posing

37:14.038 --> 37:16.638
for some statue of justice.

37:16.640 --> 37:19.608
I took pity
on some clueless chick

37:19.610 --> 37:21.677
was raised by a bunch of cops.

37:21.679 --> 37:24.046
I tried to teach you
how a woman gets things done,

37:24.048 --> 37:25.447
and you turn around and...

37:27.016 --> 37:29.351
When the bodies
are counted in this,

37:29.353 --> 37:31.753
don't you come crying to me.

37:31.755 --> 37:33.889
Get out of my sight.

37:45.635 --> 37:47.202
I'm picking.

37:47.204 --> 37:48.804
No, no, I pick Happy Hour.

37:48.806 --> 37:50.472
No, you always pick a cop bar.

37:50.474 --> 37:51.640
All they ever put
out is pretzels!

37:51.642 --> 37:52.941
I don't always.

37:52.943 --> 37:54.242
Yeah, always!

37:54.244 --> 37:56.178
It's a brother of a friend

37:56.180 --> 37:58.113
of a partner of
a family member

37:58.115 --> 38:00.082
with pretzels and peanuts.

38:00.084 --> 38:01.483
You could just order
something, you know.

38:01.485 --> 38:02.718
That's what the
menus are for.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.720
At Happy Hour? It defeats

38:04.722 --> 38:05.754
the whole purpose, Reagan!

38:05.756 --> 38:06.755
Of what?!

38:06.757 --> 38:09.091
Of... of Happy Hour.

38:09.093 --> 38:11.426
You don't understand. We're...

38:15.665 --> 38:18.433
Wait, wait, don't go anywhere!

38:22.638 --> 38:24.606
Oh, my goodness!

38:24.608 --> 38:27.809
Officer Eddie! We did it!

38:27.811 --> 38:29.511
Oh, congratulations!

38:29.513 --> 38:30.612
Oh!

38:30.614 --> 38:32.447
Oh, ow!

38:32.449 --> 38:34.349
Not without you.

38:35.685 --> 38:37.986
We don't know how to thank you.

38:37.988 --> 38:39.354
This is so...

38:39.356 --> 38:40.956
Actually, there is a way
you can thank us.

38:40.958 --> 38:42.657
Yes!
You name it.

38:42.659 --> 38:44.593
Seeing as it's
all said and done,

38:44.595 --> 38:45.795
you're legally married, right?

38:45.796 --> 38:47.662
Three-hour anniversary!

38:49.400 --> 38:53.402
Uh, then you could thank us
by telling us the truth.

38:53.404 --> 38:55.103
Reagan!

38:55.105 --> 38:57.606
Well...

38:57.608 --> 38:58.740
Baltazar, what's the deal?

39:01.911 --> 39:04.179
I am gay.

39:05.348 --> 39:07.649
Ah.
What the... what?!

39:07.651 --> 39:10.085
Someone posted pictures
of Baltazar

39:10.087 --> 39:12.320
at wild party on Facebook.

39:12.322 --> 39:14.189
Facebook go all over the world,

39:14.191 --> 39:16.725
even small village in Syria.

39:16.727 --> 39:20.228
If I'm sent back home,
I am a dead gay man.

39:21.731 --> 39:23.098
Oh.

39:23.100 --> 39:26.701
If marriage can save a life,

39:26.703 --> 39:29.771
tell me better reason
to get married.

39:30.907 --> 39:32.574
We are going

39:32.576 --> 39:34.109
to party for us.
Yes.

39:34.111 --> 39:36.545
We would like you to come.

39:36.547 --> 39:37.712
It would mean so much to us.

39:37.714 --> 39:39.247
Oh, no, thanks...
Oh, we'd love to.

39:39.249 --> 39:40.182
Yes!

39:40.184 --> 39:41.183
Oh!
Yeah!

39:41.185 --> 39:43.151
Yes! Please come!

39:43.153 --> 39:45.053
Let's go.
No, I-I don't...

39:45.055 --> 39:48.023
Oh, come on, there's no such
thing as a perfect couple.

39:48.025 --> 39:49.991
No, I don't want to...
Let's go, we will party.

39:49.993 --> 39:52.227
Let's go. It will be wonderful.
Come, come...

39:52.229 --> 39:54.930
Eddie, I'm not getting in the back...
Yay, you're married!

39:57.266 --> 39:59.434
<i>Jack Reagan?</i>

39:59.436 --> 40:01.369
Coming!

40:01.371 --> 40:05.040
Okay, who wants to say grace?

40:05.042 --> 40:06.575
I'd like to.

40:06.577 --> 40:08.443
Have at it.

40:08.445 --> 40:10.412
And I'd like us to join hands.

40:11.447 --> 40:12.314
What?

40:12.316 --> 40:13.448
Really?

40:13.450 --> 40:14.683
Yes.

40:14.685 --> 40:17.352
Are we gonna have to sing, too?

40:17.354 --> 40:19.921
No.
Yeah, we don't really do the whole

40:19.923 --> 40:21.189
hand-holding thing here, honey,

40:21.191 --> 40:23.024
in case you hadn't noticed
all these years.

40:23.026 --> 40:24.426
Yeah, well, we do today.

40:24.428 --> 40:25.694
Come on.

40:25.696 --> 40:27.496
Come on, guys, let's do this.

40:30.333 --> 40:32.000
All right, let's go. Come on.

40:32.002 --> 40:33.435
Now, bow your heads.

40:33.437 --> 40:34.970
Oh, for crying out loud.

40:34.972 --> 40:36.171
Mom, the food's getting cold.

40:36.173 --> 40:37.472
Then bow your head.

40:37.474 --> 40:38.940
Come on, listen
to your mother.

40:40.177 --> 40:42.811
Lord bless these sinners

40:42.813 --> 40:44.446
while they eat they dinners.

40:44.448 --> 40:45.814
Amen.

40:46.783 --> 40:49.284
We have a winner!
Amen!

40:49.286 --> 40:50.485
Amen.
I like that.

40:50.487 --> 40:51.386
That's it?

40:51.388 --> 40:52.988
Okay, that is officially

40:52.990 --> 40:54.356
the new grace.

40:55.692 --> 40:57.158
If it's okay with everybody,

40:57.160 --> 40:59.427
I would like
to practice my speech.

40:59.429 --> 41:02.864
"Unaccustomed as I am
to public speaking."

41:02.866 --> 41:05.033
"As Teddy Roosevelt
once so wisely put it

41:05.035 --> 41:06.868
so many years ago..."

41:06.870 --> 41:08.770
"To me, personally."

41:09.907 --> 41:11.640
Ingrates.

41:16.579 --> 41:18.914
Heroes come
in many guises.

41:18.916 --> 41:21.483
Statistically,
fewer than two percent of you

41:21.485 --> 41:22.551
will fire your weapon

41:22.553 --> 41:24.886
in the line of duty.

41:24.888 --> 41:27.289
The dangers you'll face

41:27.291 --> 41:29.357
and the split-second decisions

41:29.359 --> 41:32.994
that will define you
will be met and decided

41:32.996 --> 41:35.363
by your hearts and minds.

41:35.365 --> 41:36.598
You've been trained

41:36.600 --> 41:39.200
by the best in the world
in procedure

41:39.202 --> 41:41.469
and tactics,

41:41.471 --> 41:43.572
but your most valuable weapon

41:43.574 --> 41:47.008
will always be the bond

41:47.010 --> 41:50.145
you share
with your fellow officers

41:50.147 --> 41:53.415
and the empathy to the public

41:53.417 --> 41:56.384
you have sworn to protect.

41:56.386 --> 41:59.754
<i>The public enemies</i>

41:59.756 --> 42:01.656
<i>that will forge the heroes</i>

42:01.658 --> 42:03.458
<i>in this room</i>

42:03.460 --> 42:06.361
<i>are as old as time.</i>

42:06.363 --> 42:07.395
<i>If they were a street gang</i>

42:07.397 --> 42:09.331
<i>or a mob crew,</i>

42:09.333 --> 42:12.734
<i>they'd be called</i>
<i>the Seven Deadly Sins.</i>

42:14.470 --> 42:16.638
If they had mug shots,
they would be marked

42:16.640 --> 42:19.708
Greed, Envy, Lust,

42:19.710 --> 42:21.843
<i>Sloth, Pride,</i>

42:21.845 --> 42:23.812
<i>Wrath.</i>

42:23.814 --> 42:26.448
<i>Know their ways and means.</i>

42:26.450 --> 42:29.484
<i>Be on the lookout</i>
<i>for them every hour</i>

42:29.486 --> 42:31.920
of every day.

42:31.922 --> 42:33.622
<i>And when you see them,</i>

42:33.624 --> 42:36.891
<i>go after them</i>
<i>with everything you've got.</i>

42:36.893 --> 42:38.660
<i>Today you are joining</i>

42:38.662 --> 42:41.596
<i>the greatest police department</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

42:41.598 --> 42:44.899
Congratulations.

42:44.901 --> 42:47.402
And welcome.

42:47.404 --> 42:50.071
And it is my great honor

42:50.073 --> 42:52.974
and pleasure

42:52.976 --> 42:55.443
to serve with you.

42:55.445 --> 42:58.279
Good day.

42:58.281 --> 43:00.482
Good luck.
