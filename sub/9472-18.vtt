00:08.475 --> 00:12.350
This week on "VICE," the
new space race to Mars.

00:14.058 --> 00:17.682
The key to rapid
innovation is competition.

00:17.683 --> 00:20.224
It's a really exciting
time to be in space.

00:20.225 --> 00:21.892
Man: You have about 15
to 20 more seconds.

00:27.067 --> 00:30.666
And then, the legacy of the
prison camp at Guantanamo Bay.

00:31.267 --> 00:33.824
Gianna Toboni: You were
the guy that was assigned

00:33.825 --> 00:35.074
to create this place.

00:35.075 --> 00:37.407
If you could say one
thing to the detainees

00:37.408 --> 00:39.366
who were innocent,
what would you say?

00:39.367 --> 00:41.824
It's time for America
to shut it down.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.407
Hands up!
Don't shoot!

00:56.408 --> 00:57.575
Hands up!

01:04.891 --> 01:06.807
When scientists confirmed
in 2015

01:07.008 --> 01:09.132
that there's liquid water
on Mars,

01:09.133 --> 01:11.757
it raised the possibility of
actually moving human life

01:11.758 --> 01:13.174
to the Red Planet.

01:13.175 --> 01:14.282
What kind of future do we want?

01:14.283 --> 01:16.507
Do we want a future where
we are forever confined

01:16.508 --> 01:18.616
to one planet until some
eventual extinction event,

01:18.617 --> 01:20.366
however far in the future
that might occur?

01:20.367 --> 01:22.699
Or do we want to become
a multi-planet species

01:22.700 --> 01:24.491
and then ultimately be out
there among the stars?

01:24.992 --> 01:27.699
Today, scientists,
entrepreneurs,

01:27.700 --> 01:30.532
and even volunteers,
are racing to find ways

01:30.533 --> 01:32.907
to make this colonization
a reality.

01:47.950 --> 01:50.658
Thomas Morton: I guess
this is where Mars begins.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.157
Thank you.

02:13.992 --> 02:17.366
Okay. Okay.

02:17.367 --> 02:19.324
Morton: <i>The Mars Desert
Research Station</i>

02:19.325 --> 02:21.574
<i>is a simulated Martian habitat</i>

02:21.575 --> 02:22.657
<i>in the middle of the
closest thing Earth has</i>

02:22.658 --> 02:25.449
<i>to a Martian landscape...
Utah.</i>

02:32.075 --> 02:33.699
Welcome, welcome.
Come on in! Hi.

02:34.300 --> 02:38.491
Susan: So Thomas, let me
introduce you to Crew 158.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.699
Excellent.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.157
- Everybody, this is Thomas.
All: Hi!

02:41.158 --> 02:43.032
- Thomas, this is the crew.
- Hi, Thomas.

02:43.033 --> 02:45.741
Ilaria is our crew engineer.

02:45.742 --> 02:49.324
And Nicholas is the executive
officer... second in command.

02:49.325 --> 02:51.657
And Philippe is our
health-and-safety officer

02:51.658 --> 02:54.616
- and the crew medical officer.
- Excellent.

02:54.617 --> 02:56.532
Morton:
<i>The MDRS hosts missions</i>

02:56.533 --> 02:58.949
<i>of up six weeks to see
how crews like this</i>

02:58.950 --> 03:01.074
<i>will deal with the confinement
they'd experience on a planet</i>

03:01.075 --> 03:02.824
<i>with one third
of Earth's atmosphere</i>

03:02.825 --> 03:03.991
<i>and a fraction
of its temperature.</i>

03:03.992 --> 03:07.907
What happens on Mars
if these seals break?

03:14.283 --> 03:16.366
Morton: <i>The crew members
go on daily excursions,</i>

03:16.367 --> 03:18.824
<i>or EVAs, into the
simulated Martian air</i>

03:18.825 --> 03:21.199
<i>to do things like routine
maintenance on the habitat</i>

03:21.200 --> 03:23.574
<i>or drills like today's
simulated medical emergency</i>

03:23.575 --> 03:26.199
<i>in which a crew member's
pressure suit</i>

03:26.200 --> 03:28.158
<i>has perilously sprung a leak.</i>

03:43.242 --> 03:47.032
Well, first of all, I want to
say it was a fantastic EVA.

03:47.033 --> 03:50.116
Okay, so whose turn
is it to shower today?

03:50.117 --> 03:52.366
Woman: No one's.
- No one's turn to shower.

03:52.367 --> 03:54.449
- So whose turn tomorrow?
Woman: Mine.

03:54.450 --> 03:56.199
Is there a formula or anything

03:56.200 --> 03:58.032
for how much food
and water and everything

03:58.033 --> 03:59.324
you're able to take at the
beginning of your mission?

03:59.325 --> 04:01.491
They gives us water quantity.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.574
Then it is up to us
how to manage that.

04:03.575 --> 04:05.324
- And the same thing for the food.
- Oh, okay.

04:05.325 --> 04:07.824
We have a fixed amount of food.

04:07.825 --> 04:10.157
It's all about,
how do you survive

04:10.158 --> 04:11.657
in this extraordinary
environment?

04:11.658 --> 04:13.491
Cinelli: Of course
we have tension,

04:13.492 --> 04:16.949
but we have to learn as
crew to overcome that.

04:16.950 --> 04:19.406
If we are going to
colonize another planet,

04:19.408 --> 04:21.781
we have to learn to resolve
every kind of problem.

04:22.783 --> 04:24.866
Morton: <i>While the effects
of extreme isolation</i>

04:24.867 --> 04:28.407
<i>on group psychology is the
big experiment of the MDRS,</i>

04:28.408 --> 04:30.699
<i>each of the crew members
has their own experiments</i>

04:30.700 --> 04:32.907
<i>to work on in their
particular fields of study,</i>

04:32.908 --> 04:35.199
<i>as actual astronauts
would do on Mars.</i>

04:35.200 --> 04:37.032
Nicholas: This is the
chemical workstation.

04:37.033 --> 04:39.616
Different soil samples
as you can tell, right?

04:39.617 --> 04:41.782
So we got those.

04:41.783 --> 04:46.157
- And Emi's using her feces and urine for her plants.
- Okay.

04:46.158 --> 04:48.241
Morton: <i>Philippe Souvestre
is a former test pilot</i>

04:48.242 --> 04:50.532
<i>for the French Air Force
and a physician</i>

04:50.533 --> 04:53.782
<i>who specializes in neurophysiology
and aerospace medicine.</i>

04:53.783 --> 04:57.032
- "Bio photonics."
- Yes.

04:57.033 --> 04:58.366
"Intranasal light therapy"?

04:59.667 --> 05:03.574
Yep! So this is
a photonic stimulator.

05:03.575 --> 05:06.449
Bio-photonic relates to
preventative application,

05:06.450 --> 05:10.157
or physiological
deterioration using light.

05:10.158 --> 05:13.492
- Cool. That's very exciting.
- It is.

05:18.325 --> 05:21.532
Susan:
So now we want to relax.

05:21.533 --> 05:23.866
We want to be centered
and focused.

05:23.867 --> 05:25.366
Just go like this.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.699
You know, just shake off all
this energy that you have.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.849
I want you just to, like,
get rid of all this energy.

05:33.450 --> 05:34.992
Okay.

05:36.783 --> 05:41.032
All the way, and then
go back a little bit.

05:41.533 --> 05:45.407
I want you all to be very calm

05:45.908 --> 05:48.449
and I want you to think about

05:48.450 --> 05:52.199
the tension in your body.
Focus on it.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.199
And then just let it go.

05:56.100 --> 05:59.532
Morton: <i>While the Mars Society
may look like glorified LARPing,</i>

05:59.533 --> 06:00.699
<i>it's actually a
legitimate feeder program</i>

06:00.700 --> 06:02.699
<i>to other analogue
research experiments</i>

06:02.700 --> 06:04.907
<i>run by actual space
agencies, like NASA.</i>

06:06.508 --> 06:10.324
<i>NASA's current Martian mission
is called the Orion Program,</i>

06:10.325 --> 06:13.491
<i>which will use the state-of-the-art
Space Launch System, or SLS,</i>

06:13.492 --> 06:16.366
<i>to break free of Earth's gravity
and penetrate deep space,</i>

06:16.367 --> 06:18.282
<i>where Mars lives.</i>

06:18.283 --> 06:20.324
<i>Garry Lyles is the head
design engineer of the SLS,</i>

06:20.325 --> 06:23.116
<i>currently being developed at the
Marshall Space Flight Center</i>

06:23.117 --> 06:25.116
<i>in Huntsville, Alabama.</i>

06:25.117 --> 06:26.657
Does it feel like there's a
new kind of energy at NASA?

06:27.258 --> 06:30.557
It's the busiest we have
been since early shuttle.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.591
We're focused on a destination.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.674
We're going to Mars.
And a Mars mission

06:35.675 --> 06:37.757
drives a much larger vehicle

06:37.758 --> 06:39.174
than anything that we've
ever done before.

06:39.775 --> 06:42.232
Going into deep space
takes a lot longer.

06:42.233 --> 06:45.941
You don't want to strap the crew
into something really small.

06:45.942 --> 06:48.816
It's got a big
living space, right?

06:48.817 --> 06:50.482
I've been with NASA
for 40 years.

06:50.483 --> 06:53.441
And we now have a team that...

06:53.442 --> 06:54.649
it's one of the best teams
I've ever worked with.

06:55.150 --> 06:57.357
Morton: <i>The SLS is
being assembled</i>

06:57.358 --> 06:58.857
<i>at a huge warehouse
in Louisiana,</i>

06:58.858 --> 07:00.774
<i>where NASA built the
original Saturn rockets</i>

07:00.775 --> 07:02.132
<i>that took us to the moon.</i>

07:02.333 --> 07:04.457
<i>The facility is also working
on the Orion Capsule,</i>

07:04.458 --> 07:05.999
<i>which will sit atop
the SLS rockets</i>

07:06.400 --> 07:10.524
<i>and carry the most valuable
payload of all... human life.</i>

07:10.525 --> 07:13.991
Mark Kirasich: Orion is part of
NASA's human exploration program.

07:13.992 --> 07:15.491
The pressure vessel behind me

07:15.492 --> 07:19.366
we built for the mission we
call Exploration Mission One.

07:19.367 --> 07:22.199
Orion will travel farther
away from the Earth

07:22.200 --> 07:25.074
than any spacecraft
has ever done before.

07:25.075 --> 07:27.366
Our goal is to return
humans beyond Earth orbit.

07:27.767 --> 07:29.616
And that will happen in 2021.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.532
Man: You're in the home
of the world's

07:32.533 --> 07:34.657
most powerful rocket
built to date.

07:34.658 --> 07:35.782
To give you a sense of scale,

07:35.783 --> 07:38.532
that barrel panel's
about 22' tall.

07:38.533 --> 07:41.282
And the hydrogen tank has
got five of those things

07:41.283 --> 07:44.699
welded from top to bottom.
So it's an enormous structure.

07:44.700 --> 07:48.532
One of the big things
that's come really recently

07:48.533 --> 07:49.407
is additive manufacturing.

07:49.408 --> 07:52.199
Basically print parts, right?

07:52.200 --> 07:54.741
We can now print
high-strength metals.

07:54.742 --> 07:58.699
The next technology
that will be inserted

07:58.700 --> 08:01.282
as we evolve this vehicle
will be composite structures,

08:01.283 --> 08:05.741
carbon-lined plastics, which will
take a lot of weight and cost

08:05.742 --> 08:08.824
out of the aluminum structures
that we're building today.

08:08.825 --> 08:11.741
That percentage
of new technology

08:11.742 --> 08:15.074
is going to increase over time

08:15.075 --> 08:16.699
as we evolve this vehicle.

08:16.700 --> 08:20.366
And that's all going to drive
the cost of this system down.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.241
Morton: <i>As the vehicles
that will take man to Mars</i>

08:22.242 --> 08:23.907
<i>are being tweaked and tested,</i>

08:23.908 --> 08:26.491
<i>NASA is also running
human endurance tests</i>

08:26.492 --> 08:28.699
<i>a la The Mars Society, albeit
with much higher tech.</i>

08:28.700 --> 08:31.366
<i>At Johnson Space Center
in Houston,</i>

08:31.367 --> 08:33.782
<i>home of Mission Control
and the Astronaut Corp.,</i>

08:33.783 --> 08:35.241
<i>they're building
space-ready equipment</i>

08:35.241 --> 08:37.491
<i>to keep astronauts healthy
and sane on long trips</i>

08:37.491 --> 08:39.866
<i>away from Earth's gravity.</i>

08:39.866 --> 08:42.073
Stan Love: This is going to be mission
control for the Orion missions.

08:42.075 --> 08:44.241
And they're talking about
2030s for that mission.

08:44.241 --> 08:47.074
That probably means 2039.

08:47.075 --> 08:48.782
We basically made it from, like,

08:48.783 --> 08:50.657
- first manned flight to the moon in eight years?
- Yeah.

08:50.658 --> 08:54.699
- Why does stuff take longer these days?
- Money!

08:54.700 --> 08:58.574
We had 4% of federal spending

08:58.575 --> 09:00.741
during Apollo... 4%.

09:00.742 --> 09:04.241
Right now, we have .4%
of federal spending.

09:04.242 --> 09:05.991
So we're getting a tenth
of the money

09:05.992 --> 09:07.491
and we have to go
a thousand times as far.

09:07.492 --> 09:11.282
You know, progress is not
going to be super quick.

09:11.283 --> 09:13.366
Morton: <i>While NASA's
budget has been slashed</i>

09:13.367 --> 09:15.074
<i>by every president
since Nixon...</i>

09:15.075 --> 09:17.532
<i>the private sector
is awash in billionaires,</i>

09:17.533 --> 09:20.908
<i>all competing with each other to
be the first businessman in space.</i>

09:43.108 --> 09:45.066
Richard Branson:
I've always believed

09:45.067 --> 09:47.566
that having the best-looking
planes in the world,

09:47.567 --> 09:49.649
while not a guarantee
of success,

09:49.650 --> 09:51.107
is a good start.

09:51.108 --> 09:53.816
But our new spaceship
has taken that concept

09:53.817 --> 09:54.982
to a whole new level.

09:54.983 --> 09:58.149
And that's why I knew
without a doubt

09:58.150 --> 09:59.941
who I was going to ask
to name her...

09:59.942 --> 10:03.274
a man who never ceases to
amaze and inspire us all.

10:04.575 --> 10:07.316
Voice of Stephen Hawking: I have
always dreamed of space flight.

10:07.317 --> 10:10.441
By opening up space,

10:10.442 --> 10:12.816
we help to change
the world for good.

10:13.017 --> 10:18.057
Please welcome
Virgin Spaceship Unity.

10:20.017 --> 10:21.766
Richard Branson is one
of the big three

10:21.767 --> 10:24.474
in the most recent space race,

10:24.475 --> 10:26.307
along with, like, Elon
Musk and Jeff Bezos.

10:26.308 --> 10:27.724
He's the only one
who really doesn't come

10:27.725 --> 10:29.682
from a tech background, though.

10:29.683 --> 10:31.974
He brings a certain, you
know, kind of panache to it.

10:31.975 --> 10:33.724
Throws a hell a party, at least.

10:33.725 --> 10:38.666
Four, three, two, one!
Whoa!

10:39.067 --> 10:41.982
Morton: <i>Branson may be more
of an impresario and showman</i>

10:41.983 --> 10:43.232
<i>than a rocket scientist.</i>

10:43.233 --> 10:44.899
<i>But Virgin Galactic's CEO
comes straight</i>

10:45.000 --> 10:46.432
<i>from the space program.</i>

10:46.433 --> 10:48.682
<i>George Whitesides was the
chief of staff at NASA</i>

10:48.683 --> 10:51.182
<i>under both Bush and Obama,
so he knows some rockets.</i>

10:51.683 --> 10:54.607
Why'd you, uh... why'd you
jump ship for Virgin?

10:54.908 --> 10:58.407
Because I felt
like Virgin Galactic

10:58.408 --> 11:01.032
has the opportunity
to fundamentally change

11:01.033 --> 11:03.241
how humanity interacts
with space.

11:03.242 --> 11:05.532
I mean, what we want to do
here is, like, open up space.

11:05.533 --> 11:09.241
Change it from something that only
500 people have done in 50 years,

11:09.242 --> 11:13.199
to something that hundreds and
eventually thousands of people,

11:13.200 --> 11:16.157
and eventually tens of thousands
and millions of people have done.

11:16.158 --> 11:18.157
Do you feel like we're in,
like, a new phase of...

11:18.158 --> 11:20.782
of space exploration
with, like, the advent

11:20.783 --> 11:22.532
of all the private
companies involved?

11:22.533 --> 11:24.949
I do think it is a
new phase, you know?

11:24.950 --> 11:28.491
And I think the key to rapid
innovation is competition.

11:28.492 --> 11:30.366
The best part
of this current age

11:30.367 --> 11:31.949
is that there will be
more competition,

11:31.950 --> 11:33.241
because it'll drive us
all to do better.

11:33.242 --> 11:35.532
And, um, and that's
what you're seeing now.

11:35.533 --> 11:37.657
You're seeing innovation
all over the space sector.

11:37.658 --> 11:40.199
It's a really exciting
time to be in space.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.324
Morton: <i>In order to
keep this excitement up</i>

11:42.325 --> 11:43.657
<i>long enough for an actual
Mars mission to get underway,</i>

11:43.658 --> 11:46.366
<i>it's not enough just to
inspire the engineers</i>

11:46.367 --> 11:47.949
<i>and financiers of today.</i>

11:47.950 --> 11:50.199
<i>You have to target
the generation</i>

11:50.200 --> 11:53.366
<i>that will actually be making
the trip... today's children.</i>

11:53.367 --> 11:55.991
While everyone else is busy
making all the hardware for Mars,

11:55.992 --> 11:58.449
we're busy training the people
that are going to go to Mars.

11:59.450 --> 12:00.532
Because of the first person

12:00.533 --> 12:03.324
who is going to set their foot
on Mars is probably someone,

12:03.325 --> 12:05.449
you know, eight to
12 years old today.

12:05.450 --> 12:07.491
And those are exactly the people
that are coming through space camp.

12:08.392 --> 12:10.657
The idea is to kind of
walk dramatically.

12:10.658 --> 12:13.907
We're putting a Mars
mission together right now

12:13.908 --> 12:18.824
to train citizens who want
to take the private ride.

12:18.825 --> 12:21.032
We want to be one of the
places where you come

12:21.033 --> 12:22.491
and get certified to be
a part of space travel.

12:22.492 --> 12:25.449
Barnhart: We've had
700,000 graduates.

12:25.450 --> 12:28.241
We try to crack
their cosmic eggs

12:28.242 --> 12:29.843
to the possibilities
in their own future.

12:31.875 --> 12:34.882
They come here and they realize,
"I've got to set my journey."

12:34.983 --> 12:37.916
And they come away completely
different individuals

12:37.917 --> 12:39.649
after the experience.

12:39.950 --> 12:42.074
Okay.

12:42.075 --> 12:44.949
Who all from SpaceX and stuff
has graduated from here?

12:44.950 --> 12:48.616
Well, the top guy, Elon Musk,
was a Space Camp graduate.

12:48.617 --> 12:51.741
Jeff Bezos, George Whitesides,
who's the chief engineer

12:51.742 --> 12:53.032
for Virgin Galactic,
is a graduate.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.907
Our graduates are changing
the world everywhere.

12:56.908 --> 12:59.074
Morton: Tonight's a rocket
launch here at Cape Canaveral.

12:59.075 --> 13:01.574
Um, the rocket and its
module are both made

13:01.575 --> 13:05.199
by a private company
called Orbital ATK.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.241
The launch itself is run
by another private company

13:07.242 --> 13:08.991
called United Launch Alliance.

13:08.992 --> 13:10.949
Morton: <i>An unmanned
resupply mission</i>

13:10.950 --> 13:13.407
<i>may not seem that impressive
in the scheme of things,</i>

13:13.408 --> 13:15.866
<i>but by having the private sector
take over the routine maintenance</i>

13:15.867 --> 13:17.699
<i>of the space station
and satellites</i>

13:17.700 --> 13:19.449
<i>and everything else
NASA's looking after now,</i>

13:19.450 --> 13:21.866
<i>it frees them up to go even
further into our solar system.</i>

13:21.867 --> 13:26.366
Love: When low earth orbit is
full of private space crafts

13:26.367 --> 13:28.824
and tourists,
we'll be on the moon.

13:28.825 --> 13:31.199
When the moon is full of
tourists, we'll be on Mars.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.491
In that way, I hope we can
keep pushing the boundaries

13:32.492 --> 13:35.366
and we can keep
doing that forever.

13:35.367 --> 13:37.491
Morton: <i>So essentially,
the small steps</i>

13:37.492 --> 13:39.824
<i>private space is now
taking for profit</i>

13:39.825 --> 13:43.657
<i>will allow NASA to make even
gianter leaps for mankind.</i>

13:43.658 --> 13:45.032
Morton: Which launch pad is
that, that it's going off of?

13:45.033 --> 13:47.324
- Do you know?
- Uh, 41.

13:47.325 --> 13:48.616
It's right there.

13:48.617 --> 13:51.532
You can see that red light
flashing over there.

13:51.533 --> 13:53.657
Those are the lightning towers.

13:53.658 --> 13:56.407
Okay. What do you think
about Mars?

13:56.408 --> 13:57.741
Are you excited about Orion?

13:57.742 --> 13:58.907
- I'm hyped for Orion.
- Yeah?

13:58.908 --> 14:01.366
They say like kids now
ages, like, 10 to 15

14:01.367 --> 14:04.241
will be the ones landing on Mars

14:04.242 --> 14:05.949
and going to asteroids
in this time frame.

14:05.950 --> 14:10.032
I want to be a part of building
the rocket and everything.

14:10.033 --> 14:14.074
Man over radio: Minus
ten, nine, eight, seven,

14:14.075 --> 14:16.991
six, five, four,

14:16.992 --> 14:20.782
three, two, one.

14:20.783 --> 14:23.532
And blast off.

14:23.533 --> 14:25.324
There it goes.

14:25.325 --> 14:27.782
Holy shit.

14:47.450 --> 14:50.199
Susan: I'd like to see
humans be able to settle

14:50.200 --> 14:52.741
on another planet one day.

14:52.742 --> 14:54.866
Morton: Do you think it will
happen in your lifetime?

14:54.867 --> 14:56.574
I believe so.

14:56.575 --> 14:59.157
Because of the rapid pace
of technology

14:59.158 --> 15:02.324
and the fact that the private
sector are really interested

15:02.325 --> 15:03.949
in taking humans off Earth.

15:03.950 --> 15:06.657
Now people are talking about
Mars and humans to Mars.

15:06.658 --> 15:10.074
I think that's what
excites me too.

15:28.058 --> 15:30.449
The debate over what to
do with the detainees

15:30.450 --> 15:33.032
at Guantanamo Bay is one
of the most polarizing

15:33.033 --> 15:35.907
political issues
of the post-9/11 era.

15:35.908 --> 15:38.491
On the one hand,
President Obama argues

15:38.492 --> 15:40.366
that keeping the camp open

15:40.367 --> 15:42.199
gives terrorists a
powerful recruiting tool.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.157
And on the other hand,

15:44.158 --> 15:46.741
opponents in Congress argue
that it's too dangerous

15:46.742 --> 15:49.824
to release the inmates even if
we can't convict them in court.

15:49.825 --> 15:51.657
But 14 years after Gitmo opened,

15:51.658 --> 15:55.866
what happened behind its walls is
only now slowly coming to light.

16:04.658 --> 16:05.782
Gianna Toboni:
<i>Two years ago,</i>

16:05.783 --> 16:08.699
<i>we visited the Guantanamo
Bay Detention Center</i>

16:08.700 --> 16:10.407
<i>to try to shed some light</i>

16:10.408 --> 16:14.367
<i>on one of the world's
most notorious prisons.</i>

16:22.158 --> 16:23.692
Were they all Muslim?

16:26.700 --> 16:28.782
Toboni: <i>After military
personnel deleted parts</i>

16:28.783 --> 16:30.782
<i>of our footage each night,</i>

16:30.783 --> 16:32.716
<i>closely regulated what we
could and couldn't shoot...</i>

16:32.740 --> 16:37.340
Woman: <i>You can't have that on... it's got
to go off. Wrong time of day. Turn it off.</i>

16:37.492 --> 16:38.824
<i>and avoided
relevant questions...</i>

16:38.825 --> 16:40.732
Are you able to tell us
what they're in here for?

16:43.233 --> 16:45.199
<i>We quickly learned that
if you want learn more</i>

16:45.200 --> 16:46.866
<i>about Guantanamo Bay,</i>

16:46.867 --> 16:49.741
<i>the last place you go
is Guantanamo Bay.</i>

16:49.742 --> 16:50.949
<i>But we were able
to get some answers</i>

16:50.950 --> 16:52.991
<i>from the man
who actually built it...</i>

16:52.992 --> 16:55.367
<i>Retired General Michael Lehnert.</i>

16:57.617 --> 16:59.616
Toboni: So you were the
guy that was assigned

16:59.617 --> 17:02.032
to basically create this place?

17:02.033 --> 17:06.156
Yes, I was assigned
to create Guantanamo

17:06.157 --> 17:07.406
and build the first 100 cells

17:07.407 --> 17:10.866
and do all of this
within 96 hours.

17:10.867 --> 17:14.531
We took down
every non-essential fence

17:14.532 --> 17:17.491
and essentially
made 8' x 8' cages.

17:17.492 --> 17:18.824
Yeah, it looks like
a zoo, pretty much.

17:18.825 --> 17:22.156
It... pretty much, yeah.
It's not a pretty place.

17:22.157 --> 17:26.031
What was it like when the
first detainees arrived?

17:26.032 --> 17:29.824
We flew them
in on a C-17.

17:29.825 --> 17:33.116
We ferried a school bus with
the windows blacked out

17:33.117 --> 17:34.657
and the seats taken out,

17:34.658 --> 17:37.324
put the detainees
on the school bus.

17:37.325 --> 17:38.574
They had not had any
opportunities to use facilities,

17:38.575 --> 17:41.199
so most of them
were wearing diapers.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.866
It was pretty stark.

17:43.867 --> 17:45.907
Lehnert's voice:
You have to understand...

17:45.908 --> 17:48.157
these people were
captured on battlefields.

17:48.158 --> 17:50.324
They are warriors.

17:50.325 --> 17:54.283
They have the capacity and
the potential for violence.

17:55.117 --> 17:58.491
After 9/11, as a country,

17:58.492 --> 18:01.866
we were angry, some of
us were frightened.

18:01.867 --> 18:05.324
And we wanted our leaders
to do something.

18:05.325 --> 18:07.491
This was something.

18:07.492 --> 18:08.824
And then I started looking
for the documentation.

18:08.825 --> 18:12.574
Some cases, we received
pretty good documentation

18:12.575 --> 18:14.616
that individuals
were really bad guys.

18:14.617 --> 18:17.157
So we had some that were
the worst of the worst.

18:17.158 --> 18:21.199
We had others that showed up with
almost no documentation whatsoever.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.782
And so what was that moment
for you when you realized...

18:23.783 --> 18:25.449
I think it was...
it wasn't a moment.

18:25.450 --> 18:28.324
It was just a gradual
recognition that, you know,

18:28.325 --> 18:30.949
all of the facts weren't adding up.
Yeah, it wasn't a moment.

18:30.950 --> 18:34.699
It wasn't one of these "aha"
epiphanies or anything like this.

18:34.700 --> 18:36.574
You know, I'm not smart
enough for that.

18:36.575 --> 18:39.324
It was just simply, you know,

18:39.325 --> 18:41.949
putting together all of the
evidence and data we had.

18:41.950 --> 18:44.866
And saying, okay, we do have
some bad people down here.

18:44.867 --> 18:46.491
There's no doubt about that.

18:46.492 --> 18:49.491
But we also have a bunch of people
here that shouldn't be here.

18:50.192 --> 18:54.324
Toboni: <i>Of the roughly 780
detainees sent to Guantanamo Bay,</i>

18:54.325 --> 18:55.699
<i>only 30 have been charged,</i>

18:55.700 --> 18:57.782
<i>and of those, only eight
have been convicted.</i>

18:57.783 --> 19:01.199
<i>And two of those convictions
were overturned.</i>

19:01.200 --> 19:03.949
<i>Over the last 14 years,</i>

19:03.950 --> 19:06.282
<i>the US has released
hundreds of detainees</i>

19:06.283 --> 19:08.907
<i>to 58 countries scattered
around the globe.</i>

19:08.908 --> 19:11.074
<i>And while it's impossible
to verify the facts</i>

19:11.075 --> 19:13.074
<i>surrounding their time
at Guantanamo Bay,</i>

19:13.075 --> 19:15.032
<i>we wanted to give
some of these detainees</i>

19:15.033 --> 19:16.742
<i>a chance to tell
their side of the story.</i>

19:34.808 --> 19:38.266
Toboni: <i> Zakir Hasam was one of the
first prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.</i>

19:38.267 --> 19:41.599
<i>After more than four years of
being held without charge,</i>

19:41.600 --> 19:44.807
<i>he was sent, not to his
native country of Uzbekistan,</i>

19:44.808 --> 19:46.141
<i>but to a new country...
Albania.</i>

19:59.767 --> 20:02.933
I think male drivers are crazy.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.682
Toboni: <i>Zakir invited
us back to his home</i>

20:13.683 --> 20:15.766
<i>where he told us his account of how
an electrician from Uzbekistan</i>

20:15.767 --> 20:18.933
<i>ended up at Guantanamo Bay.</i>

20:38.142 --> 20:40.683
To the US?

20:51.942 --> 20:54.282
Toboni: <i>The common
perception is that detainees</i>

20:54.283 --> 20:56.324
<i>were captured by US forces.</i>

20:56.325 --> 20:57.407
<i>But in reality, most
of them were captured</i>

20:57.408 --> 21:00.782
<i>by Afghan and Pakistani forces</i>

21:00.783 --> 21:03.824
<i>in the midst of a
controversial bounty program.</i>

21:03.825 --> 21:07.199
<i>Air-dropped flyers offered
thousands of dollars</i>

21:07.200 --> 21:10.699
<i>for any suspected terrorists
delivered to the Americans.</i>

21:10.700 --> 21:13.782
We have leaflets that
are dropping

21:13.783 --> 21:16.367
like snowflakes.

21:18.283 --> 21:21.491
<i>Not surprisingly, part
of the local population</i>

21:21.492 --> 21:24.117
<i>began to turn on itself
for the cash.</i>

21:51.283 --> 21:53.324
Toboni: <i>While what
happens to the prisoners</i>

21:53.325 --> 21:54.866
<i>inside Guantanamo is severely
restricted to the press,</i>

21:54.867 --> 21:58.574
<i>in Doha, we met with
an Al Jazeera journalist</i>

21:58.575 --> 22:01.241
<i>who experienced the conditions
in the camp himself.</i>

22:01.242 --> 22:02.741
<i>Sami Al-Hajj was working
in Pakistan</i>

22:02.742 --> 22:05.574
<i>when he says he was
wrongfully detained.</i>

22:49.242 --> 22:52.074
Toboni: <i>What the U.S.
government didn't know</i>

22:52.075 --> 22:54.116
<i>when they detained Sami</i>

22:54.117 --> 22:56.491
<i>is that he would eventually use
his standing as a journalist</i>

22:56.492 --> 22:58.491
<i>to share every detail
of his mistreatment</i>

22:58.492 --> 23:00.075
<i>with a global audience.</i>

23:33.283 --> 23:35.699
Toboni: <i>Released detainees
consistently claim</i>

23:35.700 --> 23:38.167
<i>that guards exposed them to
this kind of brutal treatment.</i>

23:58.617 --> 24:00.616
Toboni:
<i>In the years since 9/11,</i>

24:00.617 --> 24:02.407
<i>we've seen what that kind
of anger can lead to,</i>

24:02.408 --> 24:05.366
<i>as images of horrific
mistreatment of prisoners</i>

24:05.367 --> 24:08.950
<i>in US detainment facilities
have flooded the news media.</i>

24:34.158 --> 24:38.532
Toboni: <i>A controversial allegation
we heard from both detainees</i>

24:38.533 --> 24:40.657
<i>was that guards
forcibly administered</i>

24:40.658 --> 24:42.742
<i>psychoactive drugs to prisoners.</i>

25:11.867 --> 25:14.199
Toboni: <i>Government reports
have acknowledged</i>

25:14.200 --> 25:16.074
<i>that certain drugs were used,</i>

25:16.075 --> 25:18.074
<i>but officials claim that
they were administered</i>

25:18.075 --> 25:19.035
<i>to treat mental illness.</i>

25:23.075 --> 25:26.241
<i>Since the majority of prisoners
here are held without charge,</i>

25:26.242 --> 25:28.866
<i>often the only way to
protest their detention</i>

25:28.867 --> 25:31.242
<i>is by going on extended
hunger strikes.</i>

25:51.117 --> 25:53.074
Toboni:
<i>To prove that the way</i>

25:53.075 --> 25:55.241
<i>they force-feed detainees
is humane,</i>

25:55.242 --> 25:58.408
<i>one camp official told us he
voluntarily tried it himself.</i>

26:03.325 --> 26:05.032
Toboni:
What's it feel like

26:05.033 --> 26:07.033
when the Ensure
is actually going down?

26:33.283 --> 26:36.782
Toboni: <i>After 480 days
of refusing food,</i>

26:36.783 --> 26:40.449
<i>losing 95 lbs and six
years of his life,</i>

26:40.450 --> 26:42.741
<i>Sami was finally released
from Guantanamo Bay</i>

26:42.742 --> 26:46.532
<i>without ever being
charged with a crime.</i>

26:46.533 --> 26:48.574
<i>But there are still
80 prisoners being held</i>

26:48.575 --> 26:49.907
<i>at the facility without trial,</i>

26:49.908 --> 26:53.282
<i>many of whom have been
cleared for release.</i>

26:53.283 --> 26:56.116
I will close Guantanamo!
I will restore...

26:56.117 --> 26:58.282
<i>And while President Obama has
pledged for more than eight years</i>

26:58.283 --> 27:00.491
<i>to close the facility...</i>

27:00.492 --> 27:04.449
Let us do what is right
for America.

27:04.450 --> 27:07.157
Let us go ahead
and close this chapter.

27:07.158 --> 27:11.241
<i>The decision may ultimately
be left to his successor.</i>

27:11.242 --> 27:14.616
This morning, I watched President
Obama talking about Gitmo, right?

27:14.617 --> 27:17.449
Guantanamo Bay, which by the way...
which by the way,

27:17.450 --> 27:20.532
we are keeping open...
which we are keeping open.

27:20.533 --> 27:26.491
Guantanamo is a very
serious, I guess, symbol.

27:26.492 --> 27:29.491
We are in a fight against terrorism.
We have to defeat it.

27:29.492 --> 27:31.366
We don't need to have Guantanamo

27:31.367 --> 27:33.449
hanging out there
over our heads.

27:33.450 --> 27:35.782
If you could say one
thing to the detainees

27:35.783 --> 27:37.699
who were innocent,
what would you say?

27:37.700 --> 27:39.824
I regret that those
things happened.

27:39.825 --> 27:42.532
And I'm sorry that
those things happened.

27:42.533 --> 27:45.532
And I think about
Guantanamo every day.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.532
Toboni: <i>So do the people
who were detained there,</i>

27:47.533 --> 27:49.991
<i>as we learned from Zakir,
who's now attending</i>

27:49.992 --> 27:51.992
<i>a university in Albania.</i>

27:54.742 --> 27:59.033
How'd you decide to study
international relations?

28:07.283 --> 28:08.907
Toboni: If you could
go back in time,

28:08.908 --> 28:10.628
would you choose to go
through it all again?

28:21.408 --> 28:23.449
Toboni:
<i>Few people know for sure</i>

28:23.450 --> 28:25.491
<i>what actually happened
inside the facility,</i>

28:25.492 --> 28:27.991
<i>but it's clear that
the prisoners we met with</i>

28:27.992 --> 28:31.282
<i>will carry their scars with them
for the rest of their lives.</i>

28:31.283 --> 28:34.449
Lehnert: I think that as
we found out more and more

28:34.450 --> 28:37.157
about what we set up down there,

28:37.158 --> 28:40.157
that it's time for America,

28:40.158 --> 28:42.492
as a matter of policy,
to shut it down.
