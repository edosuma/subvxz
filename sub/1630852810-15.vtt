WEBVTT

00:24.441 --> 00:26.609
Run faster
and stop rubbing your head!

00:26.693 --> 00:29.404
But there's a lump,
and it hurts when I rub it.

00:30.238 --> 00:32.073
Hand prop
the airscrew, Cloyd.

00:32.907 --> 00:33.783
Ow!

00:33.867 --> 00:35.160
- The airflow.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.247
Spyglass.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.587
Those bastards,
they're stealing the escape pod we stole.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.009
Come on, up.

00:51.676 --> 00:52.969
Ugh, up.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.598
Ugh, up.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.266
Perfect.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.352
Light me, Luci.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.863
Don't you love it when people
plummet screaming into the ocean

01:11.946 --> 01:14.407
and burst into
a ball of fire? I know I do.

01:38.723 --> 01:43.895
6:45 a.m. and all
is finally well with Dreamland!

01:43.978 --> 01:45.063
For now!

01:47.357 --> 01:50.068
Beanie, what are you doing up so early?

01:50.151 --> 01:51.486
It's not even noon.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.154
I'm a changed woman, Pops.

01:54.697 --> 01:57.200
- Your breakfast, Your Majesty.
- Mmm.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.370
Eh, we've both changed.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.831
I found my inside voice again.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.874
And my come-hither voice.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.169
Hello, sexy throne.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.257
- I--
- Oh, sorry.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.884
- I thought… Totally.
- I just thought… You're queen.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.428
- You're king.
- Oh, for God's sake.

02:17.512 --> 02:18.930
You can't both be ruler.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.975
- That's a great idea, three eyes.
- We'll rule together.

02:22.058 --> 02:24.394
But, Majesties, think of the confusion.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.063
Whose favor does one curry,
whose boot does one lick,

02:27.147 --> 02:28.982
or the ass of whom does one kiss?

02:29.065 --> 02:30.108
Everyone's asses.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.360
You ought to have a field day, Odval.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.779
What do you say, Queenie Beanie, 50-50?

02:34.863 --> 02:35.989
Put her there!

02:36.072 --> 02:38.408
And let nothing come between us.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.367
Hmm!

02:39.450 --> 02:42.495
Freckles! Oh, I missed you, little buddy.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.622
You was the only one who stuck up for me

02:44.706 --> 02:47.375
during my
acute psychotic break when I was all…

02:50.879 --> 02:53.548
Dad, um, it's just a puppet.

02:53.631 --> 02:55.091
Wha… Oh!

02:55.174 --> 02:58.303
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know Freckles ain't real.

02:58.386 --> 03:01.764
But sometimes it feels like
he's been alive this whole time.

03:01.848 --> 03:05.476
But, Dad, we both know he's just
a useless lump of dead wood, right?

03:07.312 --> 03:10.315
The only deadwood
I see here is that hack Sorcerio.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.066
He's a little sneak.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.943
Unlike my precious Freckles.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.029
Oh, I wish you was real.

03:16.112 --> 03:18.072
Excellent, Your Half-ajesty.

03:19.824 --> 03:23.620
Dispose of this little bastard.
And tidy up your lab while you're at it,

03:23.703 --> 03:25.872
it smells like
rotting flesh and candy corn.

03:25.955 --> 03:29.751
Oh, it's so hard to get rid
of the smell of candy corn.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.669
Hmm.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.757
I'll tell you what, Dad,
why don't you take the helm today?

03:36.799 --> 03:39.844
What the… Who stabbed these holes
through the back of the throne?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.429
I thought Mom was sitting there.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.640
Say no more.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.896
I killed Cloyd and Becky, by the way.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.231
That's nice.

04:06.079 --> 04:06.955
Hmm?

04:08.081 --> 04:10.833
Don't throw
Freckles down the chute.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.711
- Who said that?
- It's me, your conscience.

04:13.795 --> 04:14.837
Yeah, that's it.

04:14.921 --> 04:18.007
If you're my conscience,
then what's my deepest sorrow?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.676
That you'll never be loved.

04:19.759 --> 04:23.888
But if I could bring Freckles to life,
everyone would love me.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.807
That's using the ol' pea-brain.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.058
I am a genius.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.685
I wouldn't go that far.

04:33.356 --> 04:37.819
Let's see.
"Poisons, potions, pudding."

04:37.902 --> 04:43.449
Ah! Here we are.
"Puppets. Bringing to life…" Hmm.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.119
I have a question. When do I get paid?

04:46.202 --> 04:47.745
You are an intern, damn it!

04:47.829 --> 04:49.414
You're lucky we don't beat you.

04:49.497 --> 04:50.623
You do beat me.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.667
No, we don't. Remind me to beat you later.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.502
- I won't.
- That's two beatings.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.170
- I still won't.
- Three beatings.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.172
- You'll forget.
- Four beatings.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.550
- Stop talking about beatings.
- Ha-ha.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.844
I'm going to get
my beating stick right now.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.848
- Five beatings.
- All right.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.599
Look at him, Jerry.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.477
Look at him lying there on that slab.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.896
Just a lifeless piece of wood.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.566
But tonight, all that changes.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.359
Now, Jerry, get cranking.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.529
- Hmm…

05:23.906 --> 05:25.074
It's rusty.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.895
This is it, Jerry.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.438
Hold my hand.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.565
Okay. But I'm clammy.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.241
Uh-oh.

06:10.495 --> 06:11.746
It's alive.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.915
God damn you to Hell, Sorcerio!

06:13.998 --> 06:15.625
It's alive!

06:15.708 --> 06:17.210
- Ow!

06:17.293 --> 06:18.878
Take that, you bastard!

06:20.338 --> 06:22.632
You gotta admit you kind of deserved that.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.135
All right, who's next?

06:27.178 --> 06:28.638
Yoohoo!

06:28.721 --> 06:30.306
Is that you, Freckles?

06:30.390 --> 06:32.100
You bet your fat ass it is.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.894
Yeah. Your wish came true.

06:34.977 --> 06:38.022
Now start clapping
while I make my astonishing entrance.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.321
Ta-da!

06:47.657 --> 06:51.202
Oh, Freckles, this is
beyond my wildest dreams.

06:51.285 --> 06:52.578
Drunk or sober.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.623
It's all due to that
goofy-looking wizard over there.

06:55.706 --> 06:57.500
One minute I was doing nothing,

06:57.583 --> 06:59.669
then zippity-zing-zaparuni!

06:59.752 --> 07:02.171
- I'm alive!

07:02.255 --> 07:04.757
Wait a second.
Sorcerio brought you to life?

07:04.841 --> 07:07.593
He's not a wizard, he's what happens
when you sit in the tub too long.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.679
But I did it. Jerry saw me.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.556
And I see you now, too.

07:11.639 --> 07:15.226
In light of this show of competence,
might Sorcerio be forgiven

07:15.309 --> 07:17.436
for his decades of bumbling and treachery?

07:17.520 --> 07:19.147
Hell, I'll do better than that.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.441
Give him another star sticker, Mop Girl.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.733
I'm Broom Girl now.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.987
Ooh! Pardon me, Your Majesty.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.616
Sorcerio, I hereby elevate you

07:30.700 --> 07:34.120
to Grand Sorcerer of Dreamland.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.205
And perhaps a small raise.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.832
Or I could have you beheaded.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.878
- Who is this guy? I like him.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.254
I like parades.

07:43.337 --> 07:47.508
That's it! Let's have one of them
stupid parades to celebrate everything.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.968
Tomorrow morning.

07:49.051 --> 07:52.263
Elfo, can you go into town
and, uh, invite the elves?

07:52.346 --> 07:53.890
You all know each other, right?

07:53.973 --> 07:55.892
Okay, that's pretty racist.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.311
But yes, we do all know each other.

07:58.394 --> 08:02.356
Anyway, the elves are having
a top-secret midnight meeting tonight,

08:02.440 --> 08:03.900
so they'll be sleeping in.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.568
You won't miss 'em, Zøg.

08:05.651 --> 08:09.614
Their high-pitched voices
are really, really annoying.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.077
Calm down. Shut your wee mouths.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.122
We all know that
Dreamland Castle is rightfully ours,

08:18.206 --> 08:20.333
as is what lies beneath.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.710
Then what are we
waiting for, fellow elves?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.712
Why don't we just go grab this stuff?

08:24.795 --> 08:26.839
We can't because of the curse.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.508
But once the royal øg line reaches its end

08:29.592 --> 08:30.927
and the curse is broken,

08:31.010 --> 08:34.972
whoever controls the throne,
controls the special stuff.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.974
Your words, not mine.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.103
Now to separate Zøg and Beanie,

08:41.187 --> 08:44.524
I'll invade their dreams
like a goddamn genie.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.526
God, I'm creepy.

08:54.283 --> 08:57.036
Boy, everybody is so happy in Dreamland.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.623
The local yokels, the royal yokels, me.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.252
Eh, not Bean. She's all mad and lonely.

09:04.335 --> 09:05.378
Shut up, Freckles!

09:05.461 --> 09:08.172
Holy mackerel!
You're floundering over there.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.591
Your love life is completely underwater.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.969
You're looking for love
in all the wrong fishes.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.264
I don't know what you're talking about,

09:16.347 --> 09:18.474
but it's always
a zing with you, ain't it?

09:18.558 --> 09:21.310
Dad, don't encourage him.
It'll just give him ideas.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.312
Hey, that gives me an idea.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.232
How about we wrap up
Bean's pity party here

09:26.315 --> 09:28.192
with a roast of you, Zøg?

09:28.276 --> 09:29.944
What do you mean, "a roast"?

09:30.027 --> 09:32.280
Ooh, ooh, I know, a comedy roast.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.825
It's me being insulted
by today's sharpest comedic minds.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.245
It's like when you toss a guy in a pit
and throw rocks down on him.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.247
But instead of rocks, it's jokes,

09:41.330 --> 09:43.249
and instead of screaming,
there's laughter.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.959
But you hate being teased.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.420
The last guy who teased you,
you threw in a pit.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.338
And then you filled the pit with boulders.

09:50.464 --> 09:51.632
That was the old me.

09:51.716 --> 09:55.303
No longer a man of rocks.
I'm a man of peace.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.888
Okay, but then, what are you doing
with those boulders?

09:57.972 --> 09:59.515
Never mind about those.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.602
Good evening,
nobles and numbskulls.

10:02.685 --> 10:06.022
Tonight, we're here
to poke fun at King Zøg,

10:06.105 --> 10:09.608
and I want to start by
thanking him for making it so easy.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.945
Let's face it.
We all know why Zøg became king.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.365
The job of village idiot was taken.

10:22.872 --> 10:26.375
Our first comedian
is no stranger to being insulted.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.127
Elfo the elf.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.464
Uh…

10:31.547 --> 10:32.840
Okay.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.301
I'm sort of new at this, so--

10:37.678 --> 10:40.097
- Can it. I--
- All right, that was Elfo, everybody.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.058
- No, I haven't even started.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.518
- Zøg, right?
- No, that's not… You just burped.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.811
That's not fair.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.563
- You had your time.
- No, I didn't.

10:47.646 --> 10:50.191
You had your time. It was
a very funny joke and we all laughed.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.859
- No--
- So, Zøg!

10:51.942 --> 10:53.110
- No--
- My man!

10:53.194 --> 10:56.280
Excuse me. I'm sorry. If I could
just get your attention, please.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.700
I'm in the middle of my set right now.
You're interrupting my flow.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.370
That's… Okay. Hi, I'm Elfo.

11:05.039 --> 11:09.126
- I thought that'd hit a little harder--
- Right. Okay, that was Elfo, everybody.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.878
No, that's not… Nuh-uh. I'm not--

11:10.961 --> 11:14.131
The seven o'clock show is completely
different than the ten o'clock show.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.299
- That's us…
- Come on back.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.468
I've got a tight 50 minutes, so…

11:17.551 --> 11:20.054
- And the clock--
- All right. You'll do it later.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.263
- All right, guys.
- No.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.140
- If you're driving, don't drink--
- Excuse me!

11:23.224 --> 11:24.684
Let me finish!

11:24.767 --> 11:26.310
Whoa, okay.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.978
So, I'm gonna start again.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.397
Hi. I'm Elfo.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.442
Okay. I thought maybe
the second time 'cause, you know…

11:33.526 --> 11:34.944
- Okay--
- So, Zøg, right?

11:35.027 --> 11:36.821
I mean, this guy, he's like…

11:38.572 --> 11:42.493
Doesn't Zøg kind of sound like
he's drowning or he's choking on soup?

11:43.911 --> 11:46.372
- Boo!
- What you be booing me for?

11:46.455 --> 11:48.374
- I don't know.
- This is solid material.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.292
- Boo!
- You can't boo me.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.545
Can you guys please not do this on stage?

11:52.628 --> 11:54.630
If you want to come down, you can do it.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.507
It's getting
really embarrassing right now.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.508
No, this is a roast.

11:57.591 --> 11:58.551
- We're roasting each other.
- I know.

11:58.634 --> 12:01.971
But if you're gonna fight
back and forth, do it separately.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.848
Come up here for the comedy.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.558
Okay. Somebody had a bad set.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.351
I'm not trying to do a set.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.353
I'm gonna step back down
'cause I'm not trying to

12:09.437 --> 12:11.063
prove myself in some masculine way.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.900
Okay. The queen of comedy is
chiming in like she knows what's up.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.360
- Let's hear your one-liners.
- Yeah.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.280
- I don't have any.
- Hey, so, Bean, right?

12:19.363 --> 12:21.449
It's like, "What is she? A vegetable?"

12:21.532 --> 12:23.451
- Ho!

12:23.534 --> 12:25.536
- Nailed it.
- Beans.

12:25.619 --> 12:28.372
What is this? Ironic hipster comedy?

12:28.456 --> 12:29.832
Somebody get me a fat joke.

12:31.250 --> 12:35.129
Sorry. We're just…
And then we're working up to a bit. Uh…

12:40.801 --> 12:43.053
Yikes! Meet me at midnight.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.389
Get Dinky first.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.271
I don't want to
put any notions in your head,

12:52.354 --> 12:55.691
but if I was you,
I wouldn't trust Bean no more.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.239
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

13:02.323 --> 13:03.949
Please don't throw that boulder.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.501
This was not the makeover I had in mind.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.799
Bean's so predictable.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.800
One, she's gonna come over here.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.220
Two, she's gonna say, "Shut up, Freckles."

13:24.303 --> 13:26.430
Three, she's gonna say you're crazy.

13:26.514 --> 13:30.100
And four, she's gonna try and stop you
from throwing that boulder.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.519
- Hey, Dad.
- One.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.229
- Shut up, Freckles!
- Two.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.481
- So, crazy night, huh?
- Three.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.654
- Dad, please put the boulder down.
- Four!

13:41.737 --> 13:44.824
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
from the bottom of my heart.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.910
This has been my best and only
complete performance ever.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.495
- Oh, no!

13:55.292 --> 13:58.003
- Okay, I got rid of Beanie.
- What?

13:58.087 --> 14:00.714
Well, I mean,
she ain't gonna bother you no more.

14:00.798 --> 14:05.344
Now, if we could get into your past,
we could see what's really troubling you.

14:05.427 --> 14:06.303
I don't know.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.515
My motto is I leave my brain alone,
and it leaves me alone.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.058
Why the hell would I want to do that?

14:11.141 --> 14:12.601
So I could find what I want.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.646
I mean, so I can probe you
for your repressed memories.

14:15.729 --> 14:16.564
Yeah.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.027
Oh, you just close your eyes, Zøggy.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.934
Oh, no…

14:57.187 --> 14:58.939
Repressed memories!

15:00.024 --> 15:02.484
Oh, Freckles. Thank God you woke me up.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.361
I was having a nightmare.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.113
What? The kitchen ran out of butter?

15:06.196 --> 15:08.490
No, it was about my childhood.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.200
The kitchen ran out of pizza?

15:10.284 --> 15:12.369
Quit joking around. This is serious.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.455
Come on, let's take a walk.

15:14.538 --> 15:17.207
Or, in your case, a waddle.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.127
You're having nightmares
'cause you repress your memories

15:20.210 --> 15:22.921
instead of sharing 'em
with good friends like me.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.965
Freckles, your good friend.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.260
Uh, I guess I haven't had anyone
I can really share with

15:28.344 --> 15:29.845
since my big brother Yøg.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.891
My big brother Yøg!
That's me and Yøg there.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.395
Wait a minute.
This is still a goddamn dream, ain't it?

15:38.479 --> 15:40.731
Nothing gets by you, eh, professor?

15:40.814 --> 15:44.193
Now, shut up and let's see why
this is locked away in your brain.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.997
Look out, poor people!
Spoiled brats coming through!

15:58.749 --> 16:03.087
Little trivia. One of these races is how
Old Man Touchy lost his eyes.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.922
Somebody invent brakes, quick!

16:08.050 --> 16:09.843
- Yøg's hurt!
- Yøg!

16:10.427 --> 16:11.303
Yøg!

16:11.387 --> 16:14.682
Oh, guess they only
care about the heir, not the spare.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.267
- I don't like this dream no more.
- Me, neither.

16:18.769 --> 16:22.398
Let's skip ahead to your puberty.
That's where the good stuff starts.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.193
Uh-oh…

16:37.913 --> 16:41.458
Ah, your brother Yøg
may become king of Dreamland,

16:41.542 --> 16:45.754
but you, young Zøg,
will soon become king of the castrati.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.672
Yes!

16:46.755 --> 16:48.966
On to the royal recital!

16:56.890 --> 17:01.353
Boys, this is where a dad
gives his sons words of encouragement.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.272
Yøg, you're perfect.

17:03.355 --> 17:06.734
Zøg, try not to
disappointment me this time.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.986
- I'll try, Daddy.

17:16.994 --> 17:17.953
Hmm?

17:43.562 --> 17:45.898
Either his testicles go, or I do.

17:52.696 --> 17:53.739
Cut them off!

17:57.409 --> 17:58.494
No.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.079
Stop murmuring at me.

18:02.039 --> 18:05.000
I'm a delicate flower over here.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.462
Thank God. I'm finally awake.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.048
Wait a minute. Left ball, right ball.

18:11.131 --> 18:12.925
Phew!

18:13.008 --> 18:14.760
I can't be dreaming no more.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.929
I'll just stay awake forever.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.890
Hey, where the hell
do you think you're going?

18:19.973 --> 18:21.308
I gotta find Bean.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.727
I can't treat her
the way my dad treated me.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.567
Hey, Bean. Bean.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.111
Bean? Hey. Huh?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.614
- Did I wake you up?

18:35.697 --> 18:37.950
- Oh, you can't sleep either.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.118
What's going on, Dad?

18:39.201 --> 18:40.536
I had another nightmare,

18:40.619 --> 18:44.289
but not the one where I get pulled
underwater by little bug-eyed fish people.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.668
It's a whole new type of dream
where I think I'm awake,

18:47.751 --> 18:48.919
but I'm not.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.380
Oh, Dad, I get it completely.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.340
You dread even closing your eyes, right?

18:53.423 --> 18:54.341
Yeah.

18:54.424 --> 18:56.802
- And you want me to stay awake with you?
- Could you?

19:04.434 --> 19:08.564
Oh, Freckles, how do you always know
when I'm having a bad dream?

19:08.647 --> 19:09.481
I don't know.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.651
Maybe it's your distinct combination
of snoring and screaming!

19:12.734 --> 19:16.488
Uh, it's this castle.
Something about it intensifies dreams.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.949
And I ain't a guy
who should be intensified.

19:19.032 --> 19:22.035
So, let's get you out of the castle.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.625
You sure this is safe?

19:29.209 --> 19:31.461
- Would I lead you astray?

19:37.342 --> 19:39.428
Hey, I see me.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.972
Yeah, unfortunately, I do, too.

19:42.055 --> 19:43.390
Eee!

19:45.976 --> 19:48.770
Nobody loves me. They all love Yøg.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.565
Aw, sorry, fella.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.734
I didn't mean to
kick you when you're down.

19:53.817 --> 19:56.153
Believe me, I know how that feels.

19:57.821 --> 19:59.489
There. You're free.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.074
Come on. Go! Get!

20:02.034 --> 20:04.661
What's wrong with you, huh?
You need some help?

20:08.165 --> 20:09.416
Uh…

20:20.302 --> 20:23.513
Thanks for freeing my friend,
but you didn't have to carry him.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.556
He's just lazy.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.601
Whoa!

20:27.684 --> 20:28.560
A mermaid.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.354
I didn't think mermaids was real.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.148
Whoa, your grammar is pretty shaky.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.192
Look, a sea monster! Kill it!

20:35.275 --> 20:36.735
Yeah, kill it! Kill it!

20:36.818 --> 20:38.070
What are we looking at?

20:39.154 --> 20:40.447
Quick, take my hand.

20:41.615 --> 20:44.284
- It's Zøg!
- The sea monster's pulling him under.

20:50.916 --> 20:51.792
Trust me.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.627
I can't. I'm scared of bubbles.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.714
Here they come! Whoa!

20:58.966 --> 21:00.509
Look, Zøg's alive.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.094
He killed the sea monster.

21:02.177 --> 21:03.595
He saved Dreamland!

21:03.679 --> 21:04.888
Zøg's a hero!

21:04.972 --> 21:09.393
Oh, that's gonna be one hard statue
to build, but we're gonna do it.

21:09.476 --> 21:12.980
From that day on,
I was known throughout Dreamland

21:13.063 --> 21:14.773
as Zøg the Beast Slayer.

21:14.856 --> 21:17.651
But to myself, I was Zøg the Lovelorn.

21:17.734 --> 21:20.988
They even built a goddamn statue
of me in the town square.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.907
But I didn't kill
no sea monster. I hugged a seal.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.576
The statue. That's it!

21:26.660 --> 21:29.621
Hey, you're not gonna
tell anyone about this, are you?

21:29.705 --> 21:31.206
And blow it for myself?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.125
What do you think I am? A dummy?

21:33.208 --> 21:35.085
Dad, what are you doing?

21:35.168 --> 21:37.379
He was just falling for his first love.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.588
- Oopsie.

21:45.679 --> 21:46.847
Dad, take my hand.

21:46.930 --> 21:50.225
I'm okay, Bean.
Trust me. This is just a dream.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.352
- No, this is real.

21:59.484 --> 22:02.237
- Have a pleasant sleep?

22:02.321 --> 22:03.739
Who the hell are you?

22:03.822 --> 22:06.158
We are Aunt Rebecca and Uncle Cloyd.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.785
Who you thought you blowed up, but didn't.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.662
Is it blowed up or blewed up?

22:10.746 --> 22:11.663
Cram it, Cloyd.

22:11.747 --> 22:14.791
God, how many creepy puppets
does this castle have?

22:14.875 --> 22:19.755
If I weren't tied up like a delicious
holiday goose, I'd kill you.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.340
You…

22:24.051 --> 22:26.845
Yeah, you better scram. Luci!

22:26.928 --> 22:28.347
Elfo!

22:30.307 --> 22:31.266
Hi.

22:32.225 --> 22:33.435
Who the hell was that?

22:39.024 --> 22:42.861
Aw, the axe I gave you
on your sixteenth birthday.

22:42.944 --> 22:44.738
We'll go after those damn puppets.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.948
Dad, you lock down
the castle and get help.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.158
Hmm.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.994
And not from Turbish and Mertz.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.249
Well, that's strange.

22:56.333 --> 22:59.628
Sorcerio, did you bring
two other puppets to life?

22:59.711 --> 23:03.632
You know you can't ask me to
remember things on Margarita Monday.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.717
Yoohoo, Freckles?

23:05.801 --> 23:08.053
Hurry up, you dimwits.

23:08.136 --> 23:11.056
I know it's here somewhere. Aha!

23:15.185 --> 23:16.895
Yeah.

23:16.978 --> 23:18.105
Down we go.

23:28.532 --> 23:31.660
Captain, Bean's chasing
some dollies around.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.496
Not now, Derek. Mommy's keelhauling.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.998
- I love you, Oona!

23:50.762 --> 23:52.139
Follow the chuckles.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.311
We're going back under the castle.

23:58.895 --> 23:59.896
Under the moat.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.816
Wow! How many lower levels
does this place have?

24:02.899 --> 24:06.486
Dungeon, catacombs,
secret society sex chamber,

24:06.570 --> 24:08.989
Trøgtown, castle laundry services

24:09.072 --> 24:13.660
seldom used exercise room,
cheese cave, old castle mental ward,

24:13.743 --> 24:17.831
new castle mental ward, vomitorium,
king's comic book collection…

24:20.250 --> 24:22.669
- How's it hanging, gentlemen?

24:22.752 --> 24:24.421
We're hunting puppets.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.507
Okay, boys, stay by my side.

24:35.056 --> 24:37.517
Nothing but gold coins. Keep looking.

24:38.935 --> 24:40.187
- Whoa!

24:52.324 --> 24:53.408
What the hell?

24:56.786 --> 24:58.246
This ain't my castle.

25:03.668 --> 25:04.669
Guys, wait up.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.844
Who's there? Elfo? Luci?

25:12.928 --> 25:15.096
Aunt Becky? Aunt Rebecca?

25:19.017 --> 25:21.228
I'm stuck.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.772
Bean? Where are you?

25:23.855 --> 25:26.274
Dad! Help! I'm trapped!

25:26.358 --> 25:28.026
I'm coming, Beanie!

25:28.693 --> 25:31.655
Yeah, see you later, Pops!

25:35.033 --> 25:36.993
- Oh, no!
- Dad!

25:41.248 --> 25:42.082
Dad?
