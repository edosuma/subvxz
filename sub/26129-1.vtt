a month in a medically-induced coma

returned, she...

I'm very sorry for your loss.

Forgive me for jumping in so abruptly,

will have to release tomorrow.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.718

not the time.

19:18.824 --> 19:19.860
I...

19:20.451 --> 19:21.487
I can talk.

19:25.748 --> 19:29.492
We think that what happened
may be linked to your husband.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.788
There were rumors he was involved
in a plan to rob a drug dealer

19:34.423 --> 19:36.005
named Diego Garcia.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.962
He wouldn't have...
He wouldn't do that.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.884
No, yes,
you're absolutely right.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.212
We recovered a voicemail
on his friend's telephone.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.093
Your husband did refuse
to go along with it,

19:45.142 --> 19:48.852
but word had already gotten out,
and got back to Garcia.

but can't prove anything.

on the last cop

22:36.897 --> 22:38.433
who went after Diego Garcia.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.355
It was in his locker,
hanging in his locker here,

22:43.445 --> 22:45.983
inside Metro Homicide
Headquarters.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.069

on the inside?

22:51.704 --> 22:55.368
Garcia has a nickname.
"La Guillotine."

There's a reason
for that shit, Stan.

22:59.169 --> 23:03.004
Chris North didn't even rob Garcia.
He just considered it.
