WEBVTT

00:02.390 --> 00:03.869
Previously on The Shield.

00:04.070 --> 00:06.743
- Sir, what's the problem?
- My dick. Please.

00:06.950 --> 00:08.781
You're caught in a rat trap.

00:08.990 --> 00:11.663
I've got lupus. Had it for 15 years.

00:13.150 --> 00:14.708
Claudette. Oh, my God.

00:14.910 --> 00:16.787
Don't move her. Call the paramedics.

00:16.990 --> 00:20.027
Why didn't you tell me that Sadie
has a history of mental illness?

00:20.230 --> 00:22.505
I need a life for myself.
You been missing me?

00:22.710 --> 00:23.665
Ex-wife.

00:23.870 --> 00:28.022
I wasn't worth taking care of
and now I'm not worth shit. You...

00:28.230 --> 00:30.824
- I wanna go home.
- At least we found his weak spot.

00:32.350 --> 00:33.783
Shit, go.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.742
Hey!

00:35.950 --> 00:37.463
You. You're under arrest...

00:37.670 --> 00:40.901
...for possession of heroin
with intent to distribute.

00:41.110 --> 00:44.386
The price is simple. I help you
put away these fine young men...

00:44.590 --> 00:47.468
...you make sure you put them away
right here.

00:47.670 --> 00:48.898
You send Lem to Lompoc...

00:49.110 --> 00:51.624
...you're the murderer.
- I had a conversation with Antwon.

00:51.830 --> 00:55.106
You're bluffing. You don't have the
stomach to serve Lem up to Antwon.

00:55.310 --> 00:56.789
I didn't used to.

01:26.590 --> 01:27.864
Oh, shit.

01:31.350 --> 01:33.864
- Morning.
- You gotta be kidding me.

01:34.070 --> 01:35.708
Welcome home.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.819
- You don't look so good.
- I'm not talking to you.

01:40.110 --> 01:42.101
It's a social call.

01:44.590 --> 01:47.707
You're lucky,
having a friend like Mr. Hovis.

01:49.430 --> 01:52.740
Smithland Hovis?
The good buddy who posted your bail?

01:53.430 --> 01:54.783
- Smitty.
- It's funny.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.823
- He doesn't remember you that well.
- Just get out, man.

01:58.750 --> 02:02.345
You know, when I find out how Vic
and the other two got that bail money...

02:02.550 --> 02:06.589
...they're gonna wish that they had
a friend like your friend Smitty.

02:12.910 --> 02:14.389
Jesus.

02:15.070 --> 02:16.549
Is that blood?

02:18.750 --> 02:22.743
- Do you need a doctor?
- Just get the hell out! Just get out!

02:30.830 --> 02:35.699
Heard you had a rough week, so I told
Jon I'd stop by and check in on you.

02:37.150 --> 02:40.540
Sun will rise in the west the day
that man cares whether I live or die.

02:40.750 --> 02:43.469
Well, he did the same thing for me
with my ex.

02:44.750 --> 02:49.301
Did more for her than he did for me.
Sounds like you guys are close.

02:50.110 --> 02:53.989
We've been spending a lot of time
together actually on account of the job.

02:54.190 --> 02:57.978
But Jon's kind of tough to figure out.

02:58.190 --> 03:01.660
You know,
IAD cops are a different kind of breed.

03:01.870 --> 03:04.065
Consider yourself fortunate.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.467
He didn't tell me. You have kids?

03:07.670 --> 03:10.309
Family wasn't on Jon's to-do list.

03:10.510 --> 03:12.865
Just as well. Easier to move on.
You want coffee?

03:13.470 --> 03:15.222
Water's fine.

03:19.550 --> 03:21.620
So how does it work, you and the ex?

03:21.830 --> 03:25.505
Good and bad. But I look out for her,
make sure she gets what she needs.

03:26.630 --> 03:29.190
At least you guys have a connection.

03:29.830 --> 03:33.425
For better or worse.
You're not what I expected.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.940
Truth is, I didn't have a clue what sort
of woman Jon would have married.

03:37.150 --> 03:40.108
Neither did he. Still doesn't.

03:40.310 --> 03:42.221
Just like him
to send somebody else over...

03:42.430 --> 03:45.149
...to carry my emotional baggage.

03:46.630 --> 03:50.305
- Tell the prick I'm great.
- Hey, it's tough to be a cop's wife.

03:50.510 --> 03:52.899
Jon's wife is the job.

03:53.110 --> 03:54.589
What keeps him warm at night.

03:55.350 --> 03:58.467
And he's a coward
for not coming himself.

04:00.310 --> 04:03.427
Is there some other message
you'd like me to give him?

04:04.910 --> 04:06.389
Sure.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.581
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:11.550 --> 04:13.427
What about Jon?

04:13.630 --> 04:17.065
When Jon left me,
he made his choice.

04:17.269 --> 04:19.147
I'll make mine.

04:42.390 --> 04:46.303
- Hey. Where you been?
- I had an ex-wife thing.

04:46.990 --> 04:50.699
- What did you need us here for?
- Not her, me.

04:52.390 --> 04:54.346
I'm gonna take a deal. Just listen.

04:54.550 --> 04:58.748
If I plead guilty to the heroin thing,
this all seals off.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.861
Without me,
Kavanaugh's got nothing else.

05:01.070 --> 05:03.982
- He's got nothing on you guys.
- We're not feeding you to Antwon.

05:04.190 --> 05:05.384
Lompoc's an idle threat.

05:05.590 --> 05:08.058
The judge will place him
in a medium-security facility.

05:08.270 --> 05:10.784
Kavanaugh's not gonna let you escape
with some cush deal.

05:10.990 --> 05:13.185
He's got Emolia's testimony, man.
He wants years.

05:13.390 --> 05:15.426
- He's got the brass behind him.
- Not anymore.

05:15.630 --> 05:18.702
OIG and the chief are losing confidence
in Kavanaugh's investigation.

05:18.910 --> 05:19.865
DA's receptive.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.459
I plead guilty to theft
under colour of authority...

05:22.670 --> 05:24.581
...they'll drop the intent to distribute.

05:24.790 --> 05:28.226
- No.
- Five years. Up for parole in 18 months.

05:28.430 --> 05:29.943
Yeah.

05:30.150 --> 05:34.268
Man, you plead guilty,
it's your badge, it's your pension.

05:35.230 --> 05:37.949
We're talking prison.
Eighteen months isn't a week.

05:38.470 --> 05:39.949
I know.

05:40.550 --> 05:43.860
Don't do it. Don't do it, man.
We're fighting this, man.

05:44.070 --> 05:48.621
I don't wanna fight anymore.
I don't wanna fight anymore.

05:49.150 --> 05:52.904
All right, if you were in my place,
you'd take the hit.

05:53.110 --> 05:56.420
To protect me, the team.

05:58.590 --> 06:00.421
I know you would.

06:14.430 --> 06:17.786
No matter what, end of the day,
Kavanaugh's still got a brick of tar.

06:17.990 --> 06:20.299
- He's still got Emolia's word.
- You heard Becca.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.865
The chief's losing faith.
I'm discrediting this guy.

06:23.070 --> 06:26.665
So IAD brings in someone else.
They still have the same brick.

06:26.870 --> 06:29.703
I'm doing time no matter what.
This way I got some control.

06:29.910 --> 06:32.583
Look, I'm just so tired of not knowing
what's gonna happen.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.667
Worrying about the rest of you.

06:34.870 --> 06:36.588
I gotta see an end.

06:37.710 --> 06:41.862
- Jesus Christ, man.
- I gotta get back inside, talk to Becca.

06:42.790 --> 06:46.021
- Let us know if anything breaks.
- All right.

06:47.590 --> 06:50.741
For him to get out in 18 months,
he's gonna have to be a model inmate.

06:50.950 --> 06:52.383
That's not gonna happen.

06:52.590 --> 06:54.387
Protective custody's a joke.

06:54.590 --> 06:57.502
He's gonna be fighting for his life
the full five years.

06:57.710 --> 06:58.779
The hell is he thinking?

06:58.990 --> 07:02.141
Between Kavanaugh spinning doom
and Becca selling him a rose garden...

07:02.350 --> 07:04.705
...the poor guy doesn't know
what end is up.

07:04.990 --> 07:07.424
Or he's taking the deal
because he knows eventually...

07:07.630 --> 07:09.905
...Kavanaugh's gonna get him
to crack.

07:12.070 --> 07:13.344
I'm off to Lompoc.

07:22.030 --> 07:25.022
I was beginning to think that
you didn't have love for me anymore.

07:25.230 --> 07:29.143
I was getting a little jealous,
you spending time with another cop.

07:29.350 --> 07:31.910
Yeah, Kavanaugh's an intense cat,
isn't he?

07:32.110 --> 07:33.987
Hey, shame about Lemansky, man.

07:34.190 --> 07:37.466
But you do know that blondie
will end up in my backyard.

07:37.670 --> 07:39.979
We don't know anything yet.

07:40.310 --> 07:43.108
And if Lem does do time,
he's not gonna land here.

07:43.310 --> 07:45.460
I've got a real big backyard.

07:45.670 --> 07:50.061
And wherever he lands,
I decide his quality of life.

07:52.550 --> 07:56.782
- But that's why you're here.
- You need something, same as I do.

07:56.990 --> 08:00.141
Otherwise, you wouldn't have sent
that little black breezy to find me.

08:00.350 --> 08:04.423
Truth is, Antwon Mitchell's
the answer to all your prayers.

08:04.630 --> 08:07.622
Lemansky's guardian angel.

08:07.830 --> 08:10.788
See, we have a relationship,
you and me.

08:11.430 --> 08:13.546
That relationship's
had its ups and downs...

08:13.750 --> 08:16.503
...but it's still a relationship.
- You make me drive here...

08:16.710 --> 08:19.622
...for couples counselling,
or you got something to say?

08:21.790 --> 08:27.899
The Niners have taken a serious hit
since my incarceration.

08:28.390 --> 08:30.540
Halpern's been running them
under the radar.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.183
Until this black-brown shit storm
plays itself out.

08:33.390 --> 08:36.666
Look, that cranky black bitch
is afraid of his own goddamn shadow.

08:36.870 --> 08:39.429
I've got some serious
old-school weight coming in.

08:39.630 --> 08:41.461
Kern Little.

08:43.669 --> 08:46.309
I knew Kern's rap career
was in the dollar bin.

08:46.510 --> 08:50.788
- I didn't know he was back in colours.
- Eventually, they all come home.

08:51.110 --> 08:56.264
And Kern? He's eager to help me
with my cash-flow problem.

08:56.950 --> 08:59.623
I've gotta hand out a lot of turkeys
at Thanksgiving.

09:01.190 --> 09:03.658
There's a warehouse on Ridge Road.

09:04.270 --> 09:07.819
Place where they're storing
what's left of the seized assets.

09:09.630 --> 09:13.908
You want me
to rip off a P.D. Warehouse?

09:14.110 --> 09:15.782
Of course not.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.458
Kern's already put together
a team for that.

09:18.670 --> 09:23.425
You just gotta come up with a plan
on how and when to get my guys in.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.985
Walk Kern and his second, Moses,
through it.

09:26.190 --> 09:29.341
That's more than an escort.
That's a hooker and a hand job.

09:29.550 --> 09:34.146
Hey, that's the price for my guarantee
that Lemansky stays alive.

09:37.390 --> 09:39.381
Stand back. Nothing to see here.

09:39.590 --> 09:42.468
Jesus, his dick's gone.
Somebody find it.

09:43.390 --> 09:45.267
Detectives, another glory hole.

09:45.470 --> 09:48.507
- A jogger called it in. No ID.
- Gunshot?

09:48.710 --> 09:49.665
- Shit.
- No.

09:51.070 --> 09:52.981
There's a rat trap in one of the stalls.

09:53.190 --> 09:55.579
I was real careful
not to disturb the crime scene.

09:55.790 --> 09:58.782
Good thinking. Get that on ice,
send it with him to the hospital.

09:58.990 --> 10:01.902
It's not gonna matter if we don't
get him stable. We need to move.

10:02.110 --> 10:03.338
Let's get a canvass going.

10:03.550 --> 10:06.269
This is the same m.o.
As that attack couple of weeks ago.

10:06.470 --> 10:08.461
Suspect was male,
Caucasian, thirties.

10:08.670 --> 10:10.308
Well, let's not rule anyone out yet.

10:10.510 --> 10:13.070
In a world of men,
thought has even crossed my mind.

10:13.270 --> 10:15.864
Serrated teeth.
Interlocking, no less.

10:16.070 --> 10:18.538
This is more gothic
than the last glory-hole attack.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.945
- You talk to the hospital?
- Victim's unconscious.

10:21.150 --> 10:24.187
He sustained a head injury when he
passed out. He's in rough shape.

10:24.390 --> 10:27.541
So we have no way of knowing if
and when he'll be able to communicate.

10:27.750 --> 10:29.661
- Canvass turn up anything?
- Nothing so far.

10:29.870 --> 10:32.668
So we got dick. Which is more
than I can say for the victim.

10:32.870 --> 10:36.704
We need to get the word out.
Bookstores, bathhouses, bars...

10:36.910 --> 10:39.549
...anywhere this sort of activity
goes on.

10:39.750 --> 10:43.106
We need to re-interview the victim
in the first attack. What was his name?

10:43.310 --> 10:46.143
- He gave us everything he had.
- He never talked to a detective.

10:46.350 --> 10:49.069
It's Alarico Trujillo.
I'll write his address down.

10:49.270 --> 10:50.988
This Trujillo guy. He's married, kids.

10:51.190 --> 10:54.660
I told him I'd keep his name out of it
if he cooperated. He held up his end.

10:54.870 --> 10:56.906
This has escalated
way beyond a twisted prank.

10:57.110 --> 10:59.101
He's our only conscious witness.

10:59.310 --> 11:02.507
- We'll be discreet. Thank you.
- Okay.

11:07.550 --> 11:09.905
Is this thing even remotely safe?

11:10.110 --> 11:12.305
Make sure it is,
because we got no choice.

11:12.510 --> 11:15.468
- Antwon's the devil we know.
- Yeah, what if it's the other devil?

11:15.670 --> 11:16.785
Kavanaugh laying a trap?

11:16.990 --> 11:19.948
He's been cutting deals with Antwon,
maybe this is his last stab.

11:20.150 --> 11:22.744
This place is wide open.
We could spot a surveillance unit.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.669
If Kavanaugh was planning a sting,
this wouldn't be the place.

11:25.870 --> 11:28.384
- He knows we would think that.
- We sniff out every inch.

11:28.590 --> 11:32.629
Triple-check every last detail.
We get one bad whiff, we bail.

11:33.710 --> 11:35.109
Hey, why don't you crank it up?

11:35.310 --> 11:38.029
Might still be some cops in Long Beach
who can't hear it.

11:38.710 --> 11:40.223
Why don't you relax, thief.

11:40.430 --> 11:42.864
I was hoping
I'd never see you in purple again.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.186
Never took it off.
You know how that goes.

11:45.390 --> 11:46.948
Yeah, I do.

11:47.710 --> 11:50.508
- This my boy Moses, man.
- Check them both.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.985
- Looking for this?
- No.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.908
We've had a little bug problem lately.

11:55.110 --> 11:58.022
- You think we work for the white law?
- White law, black power.

11:58.230 --> 12:01.222
It's all the same shit. Wanna make sure
our visit stays anonymous.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.307
- They're clean.
- No shit, Captain Cracker.

12:03.510 --> 12:06.980
That's clever. Can't understand
why the rap career didn't take off.

12:07.190 --> 12:10.307
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy, easy.

12:10.510 --> 12:13.502
- Now, what's your goddamn problem?
- Times change, man.

12:13.710 --> 12:15.780
I don't trust you,
or your ghost squad.

12:15.990 --> 12:18.299
Well, the lack of love is mutual.

12:18.510 --> 12:19.738
Yeah, I see that.

12:19.950 --> 12:22.384
You and Antwon.
Nothing like karma.

12:22.590 --> 12:24.148
Hey, the favour, I have to do.

12:24.350 --> 12:26.580
Taking mouth shit from M.C. Has-Been,
I don't.

12:26.790 --> 12:27.905
Come on, come on, fellas.

12:28.110 --> 12:32.581
Now, let's just put this history on hold
and get this shit done. Okay?

12:33.390 --> 12:36.188
- Let's go over it.
- Let's.

12:38.030 --> 12:39.543
Okay. There's one guard.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.184
Spends most of his shift
at the gatehouse, here.

12:42.390 --> 12:45.143
Guy of ours says
the warehouse is wall-to-wall cameras.

12:45.350 --> 12:48.467
They feed into monitors at the gate.
The seizure locker's here.

12:48.670 --> 12:52.458
Can't miss it. Right past the Hummer.
There's antiques, TVs and a safe.

12:52.670 --> 12:54.069
- A big one.
- Mitchell was right.

12:54.270 --> 12:57.262
We checked the inventory. Over
500 grand in watches and jewellery.

12:57.470 --> 12:58.949
Yeah, and that's all we go for.

12:59.150 --> 13:02.347
No one drives out of there
with a Hummer or a flat screen.

13:02.830 --> 13:04.149
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

13:04.350 --> 13:06.580
- Why?
- We need to talk.

13:08.310 --> 13:12.019
Kavanaugh's covering his bets in case
the case against you doesn't make.

13:12.230 --> 13:13.868
What do you mean "in case"?

13:14.070 --> 13:16.868
Surprised this clown
hasn't gotten the hook already.

13:17.070 --> 13:20.187
By acknowledging you failed to
clear the room when Terry was shot...

13:20.390 --> 13:23.666
...Kavanaugh's trying to characterise
your earlier statements as false.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.828
That's bullshit.
I've told the truth since day one.

13:27.030 --> 13:29.385
Nothing I said has changed
because the facts haven't.

13:29.590 --> 13:32.104
Well, then he's doing a good
job of twisting your words.

13:32.310 --> 13:35.143
It's not inconceivable
that he could cost you your retirement.

13:35.350 --> 13:36.419
Where did you hear that?

13:36.630 --> 13:40.100
Your case was referred
to the Police Committee for review.

13:41.230 --> 13:45.064
You let him try to take my pension.
PBA reps will have his head on a pike.

13:45.270 --> 13:46.908
Well, I wouldn't be so sure.

13:47.110 --> 13:50.307
You know, Kavanaugh could get this
as a way to end his investigation.

13:50.510 --> 13:53.661
Never mind prying a cop with
a sketchy jacket off the taxpayers' tit.

13:55.470 --> 13:58.382
Anyway, we said we'd share.
Thought you'd want the heads up.

13:58.590 --> 14:01.343
- Thanks.
- Hey, wait a minute.

14:01.550 --> 14:04.269
Is Kavanaugh making any noise
around here about me?

14:04.470 --> 14:07.701
- All's been quiet as it relates to you.
- Undermining him is a priority.

14:07.910 --> 14:09.662
For both of us.

14:15.590 --> 14:17.342
We'd like to speak to Alarico Trujillo.

14:17.550 --> 14:20.667
About a car accident he witnessed
a couple weeks back.

14:26.390 --> 14:28.540
We had a few more questions
about that accident.

14:28.750 --> 14:31.901
- I told you people everything.
- Didn't tell me about no car accident.

14:32.110 --> 14:33.259
I got nothing more to say.

14:33.470 --> 14:36.109
There's been another driver
that's been seriously injured.

14:36.310 --> 14:39.620
- It's important you come with us.
- Someplace private.

14:39.830 --> 14:41.183
Look, man...

14:42.230 --> 14:44.425
...just leave me alone, okay?

14:46.070 --> 14:48.743
We can do this another way
if we have to.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.063
Soon this is gonna be a lonely room
filled with empty lockers.

15:00.270 --> 15:03.626
You and me are the only ones on
the way out. I cut a deal with the DA.

15:07.230 --> 15:08.743
- What deal's that?
- Ask the chief.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.781
It's on his desk
waiting for a signature.

15:10.990 --> 15:14.062
He'll be out on parole before
the blood rushes back to your face.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.907
You don't mind if I check the facts
before I pack my bags, do you?

15:19.110 --> 15:20.543
I don't give a shit what you do.

15:30.350 --> 15:32.500
Yeah. Thanks.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.745
Chief's office hasn't even seen
Lemansky's deal yet.

15:35.950 --> 15:39.340
His mouthpiece is feeding him
a happy meal to keep his spirits up.

15:39.550 --> 15:44.908
Did Vic bite on that intel
about me going after his pension?

15:45.110 --> 15:47.340
You didn't see the steam
coming off his bald head?

15:47.550 --> 15:48.699
Beautiful, man.

15:48.910 --> 15:51.219
And I so want there to be trust
between you two.

15:54.190 --> 15:56.465
- I need to use your office.
- Of course.

15:56.670 --> 15:59.821
- Anything I can do for you?
- No. It's a police matter.

16:08.190 --> 16:11.182
Gave us all a scare,
that spill you took.

16:12.230 --> 16:16.701
Well, if you got one of these,
there's plenty of bounce to the ounce.

16:16.910 --> 16:17.979
Let me get to the point.

16:18.190 --> 16:20.704
I've been made aware
that you have a medical condition.

16:20.910 --> 16:23.140
One that could compromise
your ability to perform.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.581
You needed to disclose
a disease like lupus. You didn't.

16:26.790 --> 16:28.303
Because it was a personal matter.

16:28.510 --> 16:31.786
Suppose you took a header out in the
field. You could've put officers at risk.

16:31.990 --> 16:36.063
But it didn't happen. And I'm not here
because of how I knock down doors.

16:36.270 --> 16:39.103
I'm ordering you to see a physician
for a full medical review.

16:39.310 --> 16:41.346
Until then,
you're assigned to desk duty.

16:41.550 --> 16:45.020
Then let's get it done, ASAP.
I've got plenty of cases to clear.

16:45.230 --> 16:49.382
I'm responsible for the health
and welfare of everyone working here.

16:52.150 --> 16:53.708
Maybe you ought to do something...

16:53.910 --> 16:56.470
...about the bullshit in this place.
- Claudette, don't...

16:56.670 --> 17:00.788
Don't interrupt. This man, Kavanaugh,
that you've just given the place over to.

17:00.990 --> 17:03.140
I understand he's got
an investigation to run...

17:03.350 --> 17:05.739
...but have you any idea
what he's doing to morale?

17:05.950 --> 17:08.782
- She's got a point there.
- IAD is arrogant and intrusive.

17:08.990 --> 17:11.378
It's the nature of the beast.
But this man...

17:11.589 --> 17:14.387
...takes intimidation
to a whole other level.

17:14.589 --> 17:16.660
He's got
every officer in this place spooked.

17:16.869 --> 17:20.863
They spend more time looking over
their shoulders than doing their jobs.

17:21.069 --> 17:23.060
Our last captain
had unpopular policies.

17:23.270 --> 17:26.307
So you stuck us with an interim
jellyfish that won't rock the boat.

17:26.510 --> 17:29.308
Then you cut resources
that we need to do the job.

17:29.510 --> 17:31.068
Talk about putting people at risk.

17:31.270 --> 17:33.067
Crime stats are down
since I took over.

17:34.070 --> 17:38.143
Look, if you aren't out to lunch,
passing the buck...

17:38.350 --> 17:41.501
...or leaving every day at 4:00,
you'd know our citizens...

17:41.710 --> 17:44.224
...aren't reporting
half of what's going on out there...

17:44.430 --> 17:48.025
...because they know that we can't
or won't do anything.

17:49.590 --> 17:53.060
If you want me to go and pee in a cup,
I'll be happy to fill it.

17:53.430 --> 17:55.421
But I'm not your problem.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.667
Pretty loopy.

18:02.350 --> 18:04.705
Maybe that's why they call it lupus.

18:06.390 --> 18:08.904
I've been here too long.
My wife's gonna get suspicious.

18:09.110 --> 18:12.102
You have a plausible cover story.
If you'd like me to explain...

18:12.310 --> 18:13.459
No. Please.

18:13.670 --> 18:16.104
- Dutch.
- I just wanna go home.

18:16.630 --> 18:19.098
Give me a second. Sit down.

18:19.550 --> 18:22.906
- What did the assistant chief want?
- I'm trying to comprehend...

18:23.110 --> 18:26.261
...why you felt the need to inform
the department that I have lupus.

18:27.550 --> 18:29.825
What? I did nothing of the kind.

18:30.030 --> 18:32.464
The chief's office
is certainly up to speed.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.900
- Well, not from me.
- You're the only one who knew.

18:35.110 --> 18:37.419
- Obviously not.
- Because of you, I'm riding a desk.

18:37.630 --> 18:39.586
Okay, Claudette,
you're not hearing me.

18:39.790 --> 18:41.860
I have not spoken to anyone
about this.

18:42.070 --> 18:45.028
You went to the DA before
to make a peace behind my back.

18:45.230 --> 18:47.027
- Remember?
- Oh, come on.

18:49.870 --> 18:50.939
You don't believe me?

18:51.150 --> 18:55.029
If you didn't tell them directly,
then somebody you told did.

18:55.230 --> 18:58.700
Maybe that little Latina wet dream.
You gave her a little bit of gossip...

18:58.910 --> 19:00.946
...so you could show
how plugged-in you are.

19:01.150 --> 19:04.825
You've crossed the line into
wholesale character assassination.

19:05.030 --> 19:09.182
Career assassination is a lot worse.

19:13.590 --> 19:15.262
This is good. This helps a lot.

19:15.470 --> 19:18.382
- I'll have an officer give you a ride.
- I'll take a bus.

19:18.590 --> 19:21.707
I don't wanna be getting out of
a police car in my neighbourhood.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.504
- Captain?
- What can I do for you?

19:24.710 --> 19:27.941
Art Gadwah,
Los Angeles Gay Men's Initiative.

19:28.150 --> 19:32.462
I'd like to talk to whoever's in charge
about attacks on our community.

19:32.670 --> 19:35.946
Julien, come talk to this guy
about the rat trap glory-hole business.

19:36.150 --> 19:39.301
This is Officer Lowe. He's been
with this since the beginning.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.102
Yeah, we've been
interviewing witnesses.

19:45.310 --> 19:48.666
In the meantime, we're asking anyone
with any information to contact us.

19:48.870 --> 19:51.304
So you're waiting for this sadist
to turn himself in.

19:51.510 --> 19:53.102
That would be a wrong perception.

19:53.310 --> 19:56.222
Well, your captain couldn't wait
to shuffle me off onto you.

19:56.430 --> 19:59.581
And it's clear that you'd rather be
anywhere else than talking to me.

19:59.790 --> 20:01.462
Instead of playing the blame game...

20:01.670 --> 20:04.503
...why don't you help us
get the word out and distribute these?

20:04.990 --> 20:08.778
I'm sure you people know where
the glory holes are better than we do.

20:09.270 --> 20:12.103
Are you aware that at least
half a dozen attacks we know of...

20:12.310 --> 20:13.663
...haven't even been reported?

20:13.870 --> 20:16.384
Maybe those people knew
what they were doing was wrong.

20:16.590 --> 20:21.220
- Engaging in consensual sex?
- In public, which is a crime.

20:21.870 --> 20:24.100
Thank you for coming
and registering your concern.

20:24.310 --> 20:28.223
- I need your name and badge...
- You need to keep your hands off me.

20:31.150 --> 20:34.267
You and your buddies in blue
can hate all you want to. We're here.

20:34.470 --> 20:36.620
You need to get used to it.

20:43.350 --> 20:45.989
Did a five-mile sweep.
No RF or infrared readout anywhere.

20:46.190 --> 20:48.021
Nobody's transmitting
any voice or video.

20:48.230 --> 20:51.381
Well, we've been up and down the dial.
No coded chatter.

21:20.590 --> 21:22.069
- Oh, Christ.
- Don't move.

21:22.270 --> 21:25.740
- You don't fight, you don't die.
- No fighting, man. Whatever you want.

21:27.350 --> 21:29.864
Man, come on, don't...

21:31.430 --> 21:32.829
Open up. That one and that one.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.142
Hold his gun.

21:41.070 --> 21:43.823
You get the safe.
I'll check the drawer.

21:44.230 --> 21:45.743
Come on.

22:02.670 --> 22:05.582
Please, I got a family.
Just let me go, okay?

22:05.790 --> 22:07.701
- I won't say anything.
- Shut that bitch up.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.389
- I won't say anything.
- Shut up.

22:10.990 --> 22:12.582
Jesus.

22:18.270 --> 22:20.022
Don't forget the tools.

22:23.670 --> 22:25.740
Jesus Christ.
What the hell are you doing?

22:25.950 --> 22:28.589
Just finishing the job.
Antwon's orders.

22:28.790 --> 22:30.018
- Kern had to go.
- Holy shit.

22:30.230 --> 22:32.903
Turn around against the fence
right now! Right now!

22:33.110 --> 22:34.543
- He's gone.
- What about Kern?

22:34.750 --> 22:36.342
Shit!

22:36.550 --> 22:38.745
- This was not part of the deal.
- Sure it was.

22:38.950 --> 22:41.100
- Part Antwon didn't tell you about.
- Holy shit.

22:46.910 --> 22:48.628
It's done.

22:48.830 --> 22:51.628
Kill me,
and you lose favour with Antwon.

22:51.830 --> 22:55.709
And your boy end up face down
in a pool of blood and blow juice.

22:57.630 --> 22:58.983
Hey. Hey.

23:00.870 --> 23:02.462
Get up.

23:04.350 --> 23:07.103
- Get the safe and get out.
- You heard him, let's go.

23:07.310 --> 23:08.743
Get out.

23:09.630 --> 23:11.109
Go.

23:17.950 --> 23:20.100
What the hell do we do here?

23:20.910 --> 23:22.662
Goddamn it.

23:25.150 --> 23:27.948
- Give me a hand.
- Shit. Shit.

23:32.670 --> 23:35.423
- I don't get it.
- Kern was no back-seat banger.

23:35.630 --> 23:38.144
Antwon had him taken out
before Kern took over.

23:39.350 --> 23:41.580
Why not just whack him
when he's in the hood?

23:41.790 --> 23:43.621
Word got out
that Antwon took out Kern...

23:43.830 --> 23:45.707
...the street would take it
as a weakness.

23:45.910 --> 23:48.219
Gang without a leader,
brothers jump to other sets.

23:48.430 --> 23:52.264
Kern goes down in the line of duty,
gets the Niners street cred.

23:53.510 --> 23:56.820
Moses takes over,
pushes Antwon's agenda.

23:57.030 --> 23:58.509
Goddamn it.

23:59.430 --> 24:00.419
Goddamn it, man.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.508
Let's go.

24:10.390 --> 24:11.539
You gotta be shitting me.

24:14.110 --> 24:15.782
These brothers can take a bullet.

24:15.990 --> 24:18.106
Oh, God. What now?

24:18.310 --> 24:19.459
Get me help.

24:19.670 --> 24:20.898
Get me help.

24:21.150 --> 24:22.139
Please.

24:22.350 --> 24:23.339
Let's go.

24:23.550 --> 24:26.701
- Vic, come on, man.
- 911 will take 20 minutes to get here.

24:26.950 --> 24:28.702
He's gonna be dead in 10.

24:30.870 --> 24:33.668
We'll wait. Then we leave, call it in.

24:33.870 --> 24:35.019
Are you sure about this?

24:35.230 --> 24:38.506
Kern's dead. We can still save Lem.

24:41.350 --> 24:43.022
Jesus.

24:43.270 --> 24:45.147
No. No.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.342
Police! We're cutting the lock.

25:10.550 --> 25:13.303
On my command, you stand,
hands on your head.

25:13.510 --> 25:15.262
Sorry, it's based on a combination.

25:15.470 --> 25:17.779
There's a glory hole there.
And a couple rat traps.

25:18.030 --> 25:20.590
Owner said he put them out.
Tough to prove whose is whose.

25:20.790 --> 25:24.419
Stand slowly. Hands on your head.

25:28.150 --> 25:29.378
We helped you catch him.

25:29.590 --> 25:31.501
I expect you to hold up your end.

25:33.190 --> 25:35.306
What do you suppose
would happen if someone...

25:35.510 --> 25:38.866
...snapped this... on someone's dick.

25:39.070 --> 25:40.389
You're sick. You know that?

25:40.630 --> 25:41.949
I didn't make this up.

25:42.190 --> 25:44.340
This one here...

25:44.550 --> 25:45.903
...serrated teeth.

25:46.110 --> 25:49.261
Guy who got caught in this is gonna
pee sitting down, if he survives.

25:49.470 --> 25:52.348
Glad it wasn't you? Be a hell of a
secret you'd have to live with.

25:52.550 --> 25:56.065
Something personal and embarrassing
that affects your ability to function.

25:56.270 --> 25:59.103
Not something you'd want
a lot of people to know about.

25:59.910 --> 26:02.378
Okay, you wanna do this,
you can talk to him.

26:02.590 --> 26:04.979
I'll come back later.

26:07.070 --> 26:09.823
So, Jarrod, what have you got
against gay folks?

26:10.870 --> 26:12.622
That some sort of tactic?

26:12.830 --> 26:16.186
You pretend to pick a fight and then
you do the whole tag-team thing.

26:16.430 --> 26:18.386
Just answer the question.

26:22.070 --> 26:24.300
- He give you anything?
- Nope.

26:24.510 --> 26:27.661
- We need to put this guy in a lineup.
- He's all yours.

26:28.430 --> 26:30.307
Tina, we need to bring Trujillo
in again.

26:30.510 --> 26:33.627
I'll tell him to meet you down the block.
Keep up appearances.

26:33.830 --> 26:34.899
Got it.

26:35.110 --> 26:37.419
- Alarico Trujillo on Latimer Ave?
- Yeah.

26:37.630 --> 26:40.622
Unis just responded to a domestic
at his address that got ugly.

26:40.830 --> 26:42.707
Run with it,
since you're dealing with him.

26:42.910 --> 26:43.945
Okay. Okay.

26:44.150 --> 26:46.744
I got balls in the air
on a big 211 that got called in.

26:46.950 --> 26:49.339
I'm gonna check in on it personally.

26:50.430 --> 26:53.183
We got here, he was standing
over her with a baseball bat.

26:53.390 --> 26:56.621
We took it off him,
but not before he got a few whacks in.

26:56.830 --> 26:58.388
I got this.

26:58.590 --> 26:59.579
What happened?

26:59.790 --> 27:03.749
We got married, priest told her
everything I'd done before with men.

27:03.950 --> 27:05.508
That was in the past.

27:05.750 --> 27:08.264
Tried to stop
but she knew what was up.

27:08.470 --> 27:11.348
You people started coming around,
asking questions.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.099
She knew why.

27:14.110 --> 27:16.578
She started calling me a fag
in front of my kids...

27:16.790 --> 27:19.429
...so I beat the shit out of her.

27:24.790 --> 27:26.269
What the hell is he doing here?

27:26.470 --> 27:28.700
Pretending to be a cop.
You guys call this in?

27:28.910 --> 27:31.663
Yeah. We got a tip the One-Niners
were hitting this place.

27:31.870 --> 27:34.782
We got stuck on a stakeout,
couldn't make it back here in time.

27:34.990 --> 27:36.025
What's the damage?

27:36.230 --> 27:39.267
Looks like the guard took out one
before he got his head blown off.

27:39.470 --> 27:41.859
Detective Mackey.
Did you know him?

27:46.910 --> 27:48.389
He was Kern Little.

27:48.590 --> 27:50.262
Old-school One-Niner.

27:50.470 --> 27:54.179
Went back to the street game
once his hip-hop career hit the skids.

27:55.390 --> 27:59.542
You inventory what's missing, we'll
start turning over One-Niner rocks.

27:59.750 --> 28:02.184
Familiar scenario, this.

28:03.110 --> 28:05.749
- How so?
- Come on, you don't see it?

28:05.950 --> 28:09.579
A dead cop
killed by the gun of a dead bad guy.

28:09.790 --> 28:11.746
You two, innocent bystanders.

28:11.950 --> 28:14.339
We were on the other side
of Farmington, asshole.

28:14.590 --> 28:15.579
Anybody see you?

28:15.790 --> 28:18.020
It wouldn't have been
a stakeout if they had.

28:18.270 --> 28:19.385
Start eating again, man.

28:19.590 --> 28:21.945
Malnourishment is
starting to screw with your logic.

28:22.150 --> 28:24.584
Lemansky's going to prison.
You need to protect him.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.269
You reach out to Antwon Mitchell.

28:26.470 --> 28:28.779
For some reason,
he needs his crew leader dead.

28:28.990 --> 28:30.981
Bad blood, internal beef, whatever.

28:31.190 --> 28:32.987
So you kill him.

28:33.230 --> 28:34.583
Your end of the deal.

28:34.790 --> 28:36.303
He keeps Lem alive...

28:36.510 --> 28:38.182
...his end of the deal.

28:38.390 --> 28:40.665
How does that logic sound to you?

28:44.630 --> 28:49.385
Let me remind you of a few things
you seem to have forgotten.

28:50.150 --> 28:52.425
I didn't kill Terry.

28:52.630 --> 28:55.303
You've lost your leverage with Lem.

28:55.510 --> 28:58.149
And your ex-wife's pussy...

28:58.990 --> 29:00.867
...tastes like sweet butter.

29:10.030 --> 29:11.702
What do you want?

29:11.910 --> 29:14.868
- Sadie, you gonna let me in?
- I'm in the middle of something.

29:17.950 --> 29:21.260
I just need to know
if you've seen this guy?

29:21.470 --> 29:24.507
Yeah, he came through.

29:24.710 --> 29:26.621
You okay?

29:26.830 --> 29:29.219
What do you care?

29:29.470 --> 29:30.539
Sadie, did he hurt you?

29:30.750 --> 29:33.901
You're the only one
who ever hurts me, Jon.

29:34.110 --> 29:36.021
That's not gonna happen again.

29:38.550 --> 29:40.142
Can you just...

29:42.230 --> 29:45.381
...tell me what he did. Just tell me
what happened. What did he do?

29:45.590 --> 29:47.467
What did he do?

29:47.670 --> 29:49.023
He made me come.

29:50.630 --> 29:52.302
That's what he did.

29:56.550 --> 29:59.144
- No, he didn't.
- Oh, yeah.

29:59.390 --> 30:01.540
Twice.

30:06.270 --> 30:07.862
Do you know...

30:08.070 --> 30:10.459
...who this guy is, Sadie?

30:10.670 --> 30:12.388
Your friend...

30:12.790 --> 30:16.066
...who you sent to check up on me.

30:16.270 --> 30:17.862
Well, he did.

30:19.510 --> 30:21.421
What is wrong with you?

30:23.910 --> 30:25.548
You need to go.

30:28.430 --> 30:30.705
Move your arm from the door, Jon.

30:30.910 --> 30:32.502
Now.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.786
Or I will call the police.

30:47.750 --> 30:49.422
What's up?

30:49.670 --> 30:50.785
What are you doing here?

30:50.990 --> 30:53.663
Chief's office just signed off
on the deal.

30:54.150 --> 30:57.381
Look, I report for processing
tomorrow morning.

30:59.390 --> 31:01.108
It's okay, man. It's over.

31:02.910 --> 31:04.025
It's over.

31:08.310 --> 31:10.870
Thank you, man.

31:11.110 --> 31:14.386
- It's all right. It's okay.
- Yeah.

31:14.590 --> 31:18.708
- We got your back.
- I know. I know. I know.

31:21.950 --> 31:23.702
You'll be taken care of.
You understand?

31:23.910 --> 31:25.468
All right.

31:25.710 --> 31:27.143
I had nothing to do with this.

31:27.350 --> 31:29.466
If you're asking if they
should be punished...?

31:29.710 --> 31:32.588
- Look what they're doing.
- Seducing our kids, spreading AIDS.

31:32.790 --> 31:34.109
You gave us your spiel.

31:34.310 --> 31:35.584
A moment of your time.

31:40.670 --> 31:42.149
So where are we with this freak?

31:42.350 --> 31:43.908
He's guilty, just not prosecutable.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.578
The evidence is circumstantial
and threadbare, at best.

31:46.790 --> 31:48.462
He matches the witness description.

31:48.710 --> 31:51.702
There's no way the DA's
gonna indict off a wife beater's say so.

31:52.070 --> 31:55.142
Let's put him on the tour. Lose him
in the system, buy some time.

31:55.350 --> 31:57.989
With IAD bivouacked in my colon?
You out of your mind?

31:58.190 --> 32:00.579
If you can't close him, lose him.

32:01.550 --> 32:04.986
Oh, Claudette, chief's here,
wants to see you.

32:05.190 --> 32:08.466
Hey, I tried to keep it copasetic
with you and Phillips.

32:09.470 --> 32:11.938
Detective Wyms,
I got a preliminary report back...

32:12.150 --> 32:13.629
...from the city physician.

32:13.830 --> 32:15.946
You are medically fit
to resume your duties.

32:16.190 --> 32:17.418
I could have told you that.

32:17.630 --> 32:19.746
You'll be required to have
quarterly checkups.

32:19.950 --> 32:20.985
Your nickel.

32:21.190 --> 32:24.102
Understand you unloaded with both
barrels on my number two.

32:24.350 --> 32:26.068
Sometimes happens, I see red.

32:26.270 --> 32:27.544
Changes have to be made.

32:27.750 --> 32:30.059
For starters,
I've decided to appoint you captain.

32:33.590 --> 32:35.945
What makes you think
I want that revolving door?

32:36.150 --> 32:39.108
You know this place
better than anybody in the department.

32:39.350 --> 32:41.181
You don't see me
jumping at the offer.

32:41.390 --> 32:43.824
My predecessor made a mistake
slapping you down...

32:44.030 --> 32:46.066
...with that DA nonsense.

32:46.270 --> 32:49.387
But you and I can find a way
to work together, right?

32:56.390 --> 32:59.541
For starters,
I would need a guarantee...

32:59.750 --> 33:03.868
...that I would run the Barn.
Not in theory, in fact.

33:05.030 --> 33:06.429
No one can do the job with...

33:08.310 --> 33:09.823
Sorry to interrupt...

33:10.030 --> 33:13.227
...but I just confirmed
some very disturbing news.

33:17.270 --> 33:19.306
Did you sign off on a deal
with Lemansky?

33:19.550 --> 33:20.585
I did.

33:21.630 --> 33:23.029
I thought we agreed...

33:23.230 --> 33:24.458
...no deals.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.740
The way to get Mackey
is to leverage his guys.

33:26.950 --> 33:28.986
- We're in the middle of something.
- So am I.

33:29.190 --> 33:31.704
And it just got derailed
because you guys backed down.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.502
It's over, Jon.

33:33.710 --> 33:36.144
Sending Lemansky to jail
sends a message.

33:36.350 --> 33:37.385
We'll all move on now.

33:37.630 --> 33:39.700
And Mackey skates clean.

33:42.630 --> 33:47.101
This guy... This guy is just
pissing all over us...

33:47.310 --> 33:49.107
...and we just smile and lick it up.

33:49.310 --> 33:50.948
That's enough.

33:52.070 --> 33:55.267
Vic Mackey kills cops.

33:56.830 --> 34:00.982
He deals drugs, he beats suspects.

34:01.630 --> 34:03.860
You know what he did yesterday?

34:06.870 --> 34:10.306
He screwed my ex-wife...

34:11.510 --> 34:13.944
...with the sole purpose...

34:14.710 --> 34:19.226
...of making this investigation
seem like a personal vendetta.

34:19.909 --> 34:22.185
He may have assassinated...

34:22.389 --> 34:23.583
...a gang leader.

34:23.790 --> 34:26.224
And that's just all in one day.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.658
I wonder what he's gonna do today.

34:30.590 --> 34:33.342
I wonder
what he's gonna do tomorrow.

34:33.550 --> 34:35.029
This guy!

34:35.230 --> 34:39.621
This guy is just pissing... He's pissing
all over us, he's pissing on you.

34:39.830 --> 34:41.309
What does it taste like?

34:41.550 --> 34:45.259
Chief, what does it taste like? You
know what? It tastes like piss to me.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.588
You have 48 hours
to tie up the loose ends.

34:49.790 --> 34:52.179
And find someplace else
to do the paperwork.

34:52.429 --> 34:55.103
Captain Wyms needs her office.

35:06.470 --> 35:08.461
We'll sneak the whole cow
into you, man.

35:08.670 --> 35:10.103
Hey, Lem, I'm sorry.

35:10.310 --> 35:12.141
I'm glad it's over, though.

35:12.350 --> 35:15.023
That's okay. Thanks. Thank you.

35:15.230 --> 35:17.903
Hey, you're gonna be a little thinner
next time I see you.

35:18.470 --> 35:20.108
Yeah.

35:20.830 --> 35:23.390
Thanks. Hey, I gotta get
some things in order.

35:23.630 --> 35:25.905
- I'll see you guys at the party.
- All right, man.

35:26.110 --> 35:27.907
- What's that?
- The 211 paperwork...

35:28.150 --> 35:30.425
...you called in last night.
EMT found jewellery...

35:30.630 --> 35:32.507
...in the pocket of the dead banger.

35:32.750 --> 35:36.026
Shithead shot an innocent guy
and walked away with almost nothing.

35:38.030 --> 35:39.383
Which means?

35:39.590 --> 35:42.900
The goddamn safe was empty.
So Antwon's not getting his money.

35:43.150 --> 35:47.587
- That's gonna screw the whole deal.
- Holy shit. I gotta talk to Antwon.

35:49.830 --> 35:53.618
These fags choose a life of sin and
suffering, get what they deserve.

35:53.830 --> 35:56.264
But I'm the one in handcuffs.

35:59.830 --> 36:01.627
- Hey.
- Stand up.

36:03.390 --> 36:06.188
Does his family
deserve to have their lives ruined...

36:06.430 --> 36:09.149
...because of what you did to him?
Men's room on Alvarado.

36:09.670 --> 36:11.501
Look, I've never seen
that guy before.

36:11.710 --> 36:14.099
But if he's being punished,
then it's God's will.

36:14.310 --> 36:15.538
You're his spokesman now?

36:15.750 --> 36:17.183
Says right there in the book.

36:17.390 --> 36:19.950
You shall not lie with a male
as one lies with a female.

36:20.150 --> 36:22.459
It's an abomination.
I mean, come on. Hey, hey.

36:22.670 --> 36:23.659
Leviticus 18:22.

36:23.870 --> 36:28.102
What are you doing?
I don't have to talk to you. Hey. Hey!

36:28.310 --> 36:30.266
Where do you go to church?

36:30.470 --> 36:32.779
Christ Bethany. What is this?

36:32.990 --> 36:36.983
So then you know that Jesus
lived a perfect life of truth...

36:37.190 --> 36:39.067
...and he was crucified for it.

36:39.270 --> 36:42.421
What do you suppose happens
to someone who lies in his name?

36:43.750 --> 36:46.423
Who passes judgement
on other people in his name?

36:49.030 --> 36:52.147
Psalm 71, verse 4.

36:52.390 --> 36:53.664
- Deliver me...
- Hey, stop it!

36:53.870 --> 36:55.781
- My God,
out of the hand of the wicked.

36:56.030 --> 36:58.749
Out of the hand
of the unrighteous and the cruel man.

36:58.990 --> 37:00.708
- Stop!
- You wanted to look at a man...

37:00.910 --> 37:02.662
...down there.
You wanted to touch it.

37:02.870 --> 37:04.622
Thought about it maybe all your life.

37:04.870 --> 37:07.430
You just never did it
because you knew that it was wrong.

37:07.630 --> 37:10.224
No. No. No! Oh, God!

37:10.430 --> 37:13.024
So you convinced yourself
that you were doing God's will.

37:13.230 --> 37:16.540
Gave yourself an excuse to find out
what another man's penis feels like.

37:16.750 --> 37:21.221
No. I would never do something
so repulsive and disgusting.

37:21.430 --> 37:23.466
You're no different
than the men you prey on.

37:23.670 --> 37:24.785
- A homosexual.
- No. No.

37:25.030 --> 37:26.907
Homosexual.

37:27.110 --> 37:28.225
No.

37:28.430 --> 37:30.546
You're just too weak
and afraid to admit it.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.509
That's a lie! That is a lie.
I'm a Christian.

37:33.710 --> 37:36.508
And they are vermin.
I did it because they are vermin.

37:36.710 --> 37:39.508
Why would any man
want to touch another man down there?

37:39.750 --> 37:41.980
I did it to punish them.

37:46.950 --> 37:48.429
What, no muffins?

37:48.630 --> 37:50.541
You shouldn't have taken
the deal, Curtis.

37:50.750 --> 37:52.820
You weren't supposed
to get the worst of this.

37:53.030 --> 37:55.669
That's all you did
is threaten me with jail.

37:55.910 --> 37:59.949
- That's all it was. It was just a threat.
- You threw me in County. Arrested me.

38:00.150 --> 38:02.106
I knew you'd make bail,
just not so soon.

38:02.310 --> 38:03.902
It's just a strategy.

38:04.110 --> 38:06.863
A wedge to get you to turn.

38:08.310 --> 38:12.223
Cops will always give it up
with the threat of jail.

38:12.430 --> 38:13.658
Always.

38:13.910 --> 38:16.344
But not you.
Not Curtis Lemansky.

38:16.550 --> 38:18.461
I can't believe you're doing this.

38:18.670 --> 38:20.183
You're gonna
take the hit for him.

38:20.390 --> 38:22.699
- For them?
- Yeah, well, believe it.

38:22.910 --> 38:25.299
I'm sorry, I didn't...

38:27.030 --> 38:28.986
That we didn't become
friends sooner.

38:31.430 --> 38:33.785
Maybe I could've pulled this
in another direction...

38:33.990 --> 38:35.662
...if I just made a...

38:39.390 --> 38:42.382
Any man would be lucky
to have you in his corner.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.508
Good luck, Curtis.

38:53.670 --> 38:55.865
Hey. Hey.

38:56.950 --> 38:58.508
It's over.

39:01.510 --> 39:03.068
I know.

39:04.110 --> 39:06.226
Take care of yourself, okay?

39:13.070 --> 39:14.628
Things went south.

39:14.830 --> 39:17.469
Dirty south. Alabama south.

39:17.710 --> 39:20.782
If I had all the information going in,
we wouldn't be sitting here.

39:21.030 --> 39:22.748
But here we are right now.

39:22.950 --> 39:24.747
Big blue and his little black puppet.

39:24.990 --> 39:27.345
What the hell are you talking about?

39:27.550 --> 39:29.347
Kavanaugh dimed me, man.

39:29.590 --> 39:32.388
Told me you brag about how
you were playing me against him.

39:32.630 --> 39:34.905
How you manipulated me
into protecting Lemansky...

39:35.110 --> 39:37.260
...to shit all over his leverage.
- Bullshit.

39:37.510 --> 39:38.909
He's jerking us off.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.385
What do you care?
He can't get to you in here.

39:41.630 --> 39:44.019
No, but he can touch
everyone around me.

39:44.230 --> 39:45.299
That crazy-ass nigga...

39:45.510 --> 39:49.298
...he initiated a full-scale
DOC investigation of this place.

39:49.510 --> 39:50.465
The heat is on.

39:50.990 --> 39:54.300
And soon, I won't be feeling
all the comforts of home.

39:56.190 --> 39:59.023
Look, I'll figure out a way
to get you your cash.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.709
I'll look into this DOC thing.

40:00.950 --> 40:02.508
You've done enough.

40:02.710 --> 40:05.349
The deal
and this conversation are over.

40:05.550 --> 40:09.099
Jesus Christ.
I took care of that little thing for you.

40:09.310 --> 40:12.302
Now you're gonna tell me
that doesn't buy Lem some time?

40:12.550 --> 40:14.142
That buys you one more dead cop.

40:14.390 --> 40:16.506
I got Niners in every pen in the state.

40:16.710 --> 40:19.861
So wherever he touches down,
it will happen.

40:20.070 --> 40:22.425
And you can set your watch
to that inevitability.

40:22.630 --> 40:26.305
One of your crew
so much as hard looks my guy...

40:26.510 --> 40:29.149
...my reach will get you shived.

40:30.790 --> 40:32.781
You got reach like that?

40:32.990 --> 40:35.265
Why you sitting down here
talking to me, grey boy?

40:36.710 --> 40:39.986
Hey, hey. That's enough.
That's enough!

40:42.070 --> 40:44.106
It's okay. It's all right.

40:44.310 --> 40:48.701
That's just Detective Mackey's
way of saying goodbye.

40:49.270 --> 40:51.909
Security back up to the day room.

40:52.110 --> 40:53.782
Security back up to the day room.

40:56.870 --> 40:59.259
I cut you a break for that meltdown
with Phillips...

40:59.470 --> 41:01.301
...on account
of your medical problems.

41:01.510 --> 41:03.865
Then I find out it's your
campaign to steal my job?

41:04.070 --> 41:05.139
I didn't go after this.

41:05.350 --> 41:07.739
Why did you do me like this?
I thought we were good.

41:07.950 --> 41:10.020
We are good.
And I didn't "do" you.

41:10.230 --> 41:13.142
Letting Kavanaugh loose in this place,
they set you up to fail.

41:13.350 --> 41:14.544
It's not your fault.

41:14.750 --> 41:16.547
I didn't fail.

41:18.990 --> 41:21.299
Is that what people are saying?

41:21.510 --> 41:23.899
I'll need you to help me
pick up the pieces.

41:24.790 --> 41:28.465
I'm supposed to stick around after
getting shanked in the back like this?

41:28.670 --> 41:31.230
No. I got some pride, you know.

41:31.430 --> 41:34.342
Why don't you give it a few days?
When you're ready to talk...

41:34.550 --> 41:36.461
...my door is open.

41:51.750 --> 41:53.661
Better get a good look.

42:02.230 --> 42:03.902
The "entertainment" just showed up.

42:04.110 --> 42:05.828
Figured it was time for me to leave.

42:06.030 --> 42:07.304
Right.

42:07.510 --> 42:10.343
This is not the safest hood.
I'll get you to your car.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.263
Oh, my.

42:14.230 --> 42:16.061
I see what you mean.

42:19.270 --> 42:22.660
I'm taking him to the courthouse,
9 tomorrow morning.

42:22.870 --> 42:24.986
Officially surrender.

42:26.950 --> 42:28.224
You doing okay?

42:28.430 --> 42:29.863
Yeah.

42:32.030 --> 42:33.383
We did the right thing, Vic.

42:34.990 --> 42:37.140
Thank you for helping him.

42:37.350 --> 42:40.262
You're a good friend.
He's lucky to have you.

42:45.990 --> 42:48.504
Hey, what's going on?

42:51.790 --> 42:55.465
Listen, I gotta tell you something
about Lem.

42:58.150 --> 42:59.663
What?

43:13.190 --> 43:15.784
I hear we got a confession
out of Trapper John.

43:15.990 --> 43:18.788
He and Julien reasoned together.

43:18.990 --> 43:21.265
Congratulations on your promotion.

43:21.470 --> 43:23.426
Thanks. I didn't know it was public.

43:23.630 --> 43:25.222
I wanted you to hear that from me.

43:25.430 --> 43:29.787
You know how things spread around
here. Like herpes at a swingers' party.

43:31.590 --> 43:33.865
While you were on the floor,
paramedics found...

43:34.070 --> 43:35.788
...Prednisone in your purse.

43:35.990 --> 43:38.629
They called to find out
what you were being treated for...

43:38.870 --> 43:40.826
...Billings overheard,
reported to Phillips.

43:41.070 --> 43:42.503
He just told me.

43:42.710 --> 43:46.703
He thought lupus
was an emotional disorder.

43:49.950 --> 43:51.827
I'm sorry.

43:52.030 --> 43:53.986
Well, you can't un-ring that bell.

43:54.190 --> 43:55.384
You don't trust me.

43:55.590 --> 43:57.820
- I made a mistake.
- You made a choice...

43:58.030 --> 44:00.624
...to think the worst about me.

44:02.510 --> 44:05.741
I'll need your support.
I've got my work cut out for me.

44:06.190 --> 44:07.862
You'll do fine.

44:08.110 --> 44:11.864
Whoever sits up there has to have
an active mistrust of everyone...

44:12.070 --> 44:13.708
...and everything in this place.

44:13.950 --> 44:17.147
I can't imagine anyone
better suited to the job.

44:21.070 --> 44:22.742
Who were they?

44:23.390 --> 44:26.029
Look, you guys, I hate to step
on the pussy and laughs...

44:26.230 --> 44:27.822
...but we gotta talk
about a change.

44:28.310 --> 44:29.629
What change?

44:29.870 --> 44:31.189
You're not going to prison.

44:33.270 --> 44:34.464
What are you talking about?

44:34.670 --> 44:37.867
Look, we made a deal with Antwon
to get you safe passage inside.

44:38.110 --> 44:39.509
It went bad.

44:40.910 --> 44:42.980
The thing at the warehouse?

44:43.190 --> 44:44.589
Oh, Jesus Christ.

44:44.790 --> 44:48.226
Kavanaugh's launched a Department of
Corrections investigation of Lompoc.

44:48.430 --> 44:51.308
He's gonna make Antwon's life hell.
And Antwon's blaming me.

44:51.510 --> 44:53.580
- Oh, goddamn it.
- But I won't end up in Lompoc.

44:53.830 --> 44:57.300
Word gets out Antwon's got a beef,
any prison, any protective custody...

44:57.510 --> 44:59.626
...best scenario,
you bust heads to stay alive.

44:59.870 --> 45:01.428
I can kiss early release goodbye.

45:01.630 --> 45:03.143
You'll kiss everything goodbye.

45:03.350 --> 45:04.544
What am I supposed to do?

45:04.750 --> 45:06.945
Lay low until I can get Antwon
back onboard.

45:07.150 --> 45:08.868
- Putting him on the run?
- I can't run.

45:09.070 --> 45:11.106
- We're out of options.
- I don't want to do this.

45:11.310 --> 45:12.663
- Plan?
- I'm working on one.

45:12.870 --> 45:15.748
- Where's he gonna go?
- I don't know! I don't know!

45:17.870 --> 45:21.385
Now, you're gonna hide
while I find Gilroy's contacts.

45:21.590 --> 45:23.945
Mexico? No. No.

45:24.150 --> 45:26.141
Lem, it's only temporary.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.779
What about my deal?
If I run, they'll throw it out.

45:28.990 --> 45:31.823
- They'll have new charges.
- It's better than the alternative.

45:32.030 --> 45:34.544
Lem, right now this is about
keeping you alive.

45:39.430 --> 45:42.263
Lem, I promise you.
I promise you, man.

45:42.470 --> 45:44.745
I promise you,
we're gonna make this work.

46:06.270 --> 46:08.261
Hurry up.

46:08.470 --> 46:10.904
Oh, God, Julien, shit.

46:12.870 --> 46:14.747
Goddamn it.

46:14.950 --> 46:16.827
Baby's coming.

46:22.990 --> 46:24.981
Can I talk to you for a second?

46:26.870 --> 46:28.508
Just one second, okay?
