00:46.066 --> 00:48.439
We climbed 'cause it's fun.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.444
And mainly it was fun.

00:50.445 --> 00:51.710
That's all we ever did.

00:51.711 --> 00:55.590
And we were fairly anarchic
and fairly irresponsible,

00:55.591 --> 00:58.719
and we didn't give a damn about
anyone else or anything else,

00:58.720 --> 01:00.416
and we just wanted to climb
the world. And it was fun.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.482
It was just brilliant fun.

01:02.483 --> 01:06.654
And every now and then it went
wildly wrong. And then it wasn't.

01:40.694 --> 01:44.865
Got into Peru when I was 25, Simon 21.

01:45.655 --> 01:49.824
But we had done a lot
of climbing in the Alps.

01:59.759 --> 02:03.928
To climb mountains that have not been
climbed before, or a new route at a mountain

02:04.018 --> 02:08.189
is what my climbing life
had been moving towards.

02:18.581 --> 02:22.006
A friend of us, who'd done an amazing
amount of climbing in South-America

02:22.007 --> 02:26.178
had seen this face in the mid-70's.

02:26.983 --> 02:31.154
I think he said it would
be a challenging day out.

02:38.735 --> 02:41.863
It was the last big mountain
face in this range of mountains,

02:41.864 --> 02:46.035
that hadn't been climbed.

02:46.477 --> 02:49.422
There's a great unknown there.

02:49.423 --> 02:53.594
What's so compelling is
stepping into that unknown.

03:28.221 --> 03:32.392
It was an isolated spot, a 2
- days walk from a road.

03:32.593 --> 03:34.596
The mountains all around seemed very big,

03:34.597 --> 03:38.768
compared to the mountains
I'd seen in the Alps.

03:46.394 --> 03:50.106
We eventually reached a spot,
on the approach to Siula Grande.

03:50.107 --> 03:54.278
You couldn't really take the
donkeys any further than this point.

03:55.671 --> 03:59.842
I guess it would be 7-8 km from
the bottom of the mountains.

04:06.628 --> 04:10.799
We knew Siula Grande was at
the back, but we didn't see it.

04:16.209 --> 04:20.379
We'd met this lad called Richard Hawking
in Lima. He'd been travelling on his own.

04:20.786 --> 04:24.619
And I think we said, "Why don't
you just join us on our trip?"

04:24.620 --> 04:28.723
I think he said that he didn't
know anything about mountaineering.

04:28.724 --> 04:31.532
I didn't really know
what pot of brew I was in.

04:31.533 --> 04:35.344
or quite, what I was
letting myself in for.

04:35.345 --> 04:38.245
We wanted Richard because
when we were on the mountain,

04:38.246 --> 04:41.145
if he were at base camp he
could look after our kit.

04:41.146 --> 04:43.768
I got to know Simon quite well.

04:43.769 --> 04:47.606
I don't know whether it was
because of his personality,

04:47.607 --> 04:51.185
or whether it was because he
was more forgiving towards me,

04:51.186 --> 04:54.959
being a non-climber
in that environment.

04:54.960 --> 04:59.130
But I found it very
hard to get to know Joe.

05:00.691 --> 05:04.862
I was much more ambitious
about doing it than Simon was.

05:08.206 --> 05:10.957
Siula Grande meant a lot.

05:10.958 --> 05:15.129
We knew, a number of
expeditions had failed on it.

05:16.132 --> 05:18.476
If no one had tried, it
wouldn't be quite the same.

05:18.477 --> 05:22.647
It was the the fact that people had
tried and failed, so we knew it was hard.

05:24.030 --> 05:28.201
And my feeling was, "Well, we'll
just do it. We're better than them."

05:37.824 --> 05:40.952
Since the 1970s people
have been trying to climb

05:40.953 --> 05:45.124
mountains in the great ranges
in what's called "Alpine style".

05:46.749 --> 05:50.292
And essentially, Alpine style
means you pack a rucksack

05:50.293 --> 05:53.582
full of all your clothing, your
food and your climbing equipment,

05:53.583 --> 05:56.711
and you start off from a base camp
and you try and climb the mountain

05:56.712 --> 05:59.278
you're gonna climb in a single push.

05:59.279 --> 06:02.215
You don't fix the line of
ropes uphill beforehand,

06:02.216 --> 06:06.386
you don't have a set of camps
that you stock and come down from.

06:07.136 --> 06:11.307
That's the purest style and that's the style
that Joe and I had climbed Siula Grande.

06:15.786 --> 06:19.957
It's a very committing way of climbing,
because you have no line of retreat.

06:23.141 --> 06:27.312
If something goes wrong,
it can be very very serious.

06:27.506 --> 06:31.677
There's no rescue, there's no helicopter
rescue and there's no other people.

06:32.547 --> 06:34.763
There's no margin for error.

06:34.764 --> 06:38.934
If you get badly hurt,
you'I probably die.

06:46.473 --> 06:50.073
I hadn't seen it from this
angle, and it looked steep.

06:50.074 --> 06:54.244
I sort of thought, you
know, "Christ, that's big".

06:58.416 --> 07:01.544
Looks harder than I
thought and than I expected.

07:01.545 --> 07:05.716
But I was excited.

07:21.817 --> 07:24.292
Starting doing it was brilliant.

07:24.293 --> 07:28.464
This is what we live for.

07:54.416 --> 07:56.456
I love the actual movement of climbing.

07:56.457 --> 07:59.223
When you're climbing well
it just feels brilliant.

07:59.224 --> 08:03.000
It's like a combination
between ballet and gymnastics.

08:03.001 --> 08:07.172
It's that mixture of power and grace.

08:11.972 --> 08:16.143
For me, mountains are the most
beautiful places in the world.

08:16.608 --> 08:20.479
When I go into these places I
feel an amazing sense of space,

08:20.480 --> 08:24.119
an amazing sense of
freedom, when I get away

08:24.120 --> 08:28.291
from all of the clutter
that we have in the world.

09:00.219 --> 09:04.390
I think we surprised ourselves as
we got up the icefield about 300m,

09:04.421 --> 09:08.477
and got up to a point where the
ice is running through rock bands,

09:08.478 --> 09:12.648
and you've got vertical cascades.

09:14.474 --> 09:18.645
We started intricately
climbing through these.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.273
The fact, that you are
tied to your partner,

09:34.274 --> 09:38.445
means that you put an immense amount of
trust in someone else's skill and ability.

09:40.769 --> 09:43.593
But at some point, you may be thinking,

09:43.594 --> 09:47.765
"For god's sake, Simon, don't fall
here, for god's sake, don't fall here"

09:53.424 --> 09:57.420
The rope can be something that rather
than save your life, could kill you.

09:57.421 --> 10:00.549
If your mate falls off then all
this gear rips out, you're dead,

10:00.550 --> 10:04.437
you're gonna go with him.

10:04.438 --> 10:08.609
If you're gonna do that sort of climbing
at some point you're gonna have to rely

10:08.999 --> 10:13.169
wholly on your partner.

10:20.589 --> 10:23.718
I think we were very pleased
at the end of that first day.

10:23.719 --> 10:25.806
We had done a lot of
climbing, good climbing.

10:25.807 --> 10:29.978
And we were very confident at
that point that we should make it.

10:34.938 --> 10:38.742
That altitude, you dehydrate enormously.

10:38.743 --> 10:41.799
You have to drink a lot
of fluid, 4-5 liters a day.

10:41.800 --> 10:45.971
And the only way you can
get it, is by melting snow.

10:47.501 --> 10:49.459
Everything is so time-consuming.

10:49.461 --> 10:53.209
To make a single brew at that
altitude takes a very long time,

10:53.210 --> 10:57.380
You're perhaps looking at an hour
just to make a couple of cups.

10:57.685 --> 11:01.104
For that reason, we perhaps didn't
brew up as much as we should have done

11:01.105 --> 11:05.276
but we didn't have an awful lot
of spare gas with us, either.

11:15.986 --> 11:20.156
There's not a lot of risk
in our lives normally now.

11:23.761 --> 11:27.931
And to put an element of risk back
into it takes us out of the humdrum.

11:30.535 --> 11:34.706
In that sense, it makes
you feel more alive.

11:41.110 --> 11:43.781
I've never been that
high before, and it's

11:43.782 --> 11:47.953
very very strenuous
to climb ice like that.

11:51.343 --> 11:54.137
Not only is it technically difficult
and unstable and frightening,

11:54.138 --> 11:58.308
but your heart is going like
crazy because of the altitude.

12:48.729 --> 12:52.900
It would now go very cold indeed.

12:53.149 --> 12:57.319
And we were up
5800-6000m, it was windy.

12:57.690 --> 12:59.053
Then it started snowing, and it meant

12:59.055 --> 13:03.225
that the whole face was pooring
with powdersnow avalanches.

13:17.479 --> 13:20.371
The snow would actually stick
on the outside of your clothing.

13:20.372 --> 13:24.543
It would then freeze on top of you,
like you're wearing a suit of armor.

13:34.197 --> 13:36.260
The last section on the face

13:36.261 --> 13:40.432
was about 100m of the
most nightmarish climbing.

13:41.653 --> 13:44.898
Completely unstable powder snow.

13:44.899 --> 13:48.273
No anchors at any point.

13:48.274 --> 13:52.444
It was physically very, very
tiring, full-body climbing really.

14:02.552 --> 14:06.723
It took us the best part of 5 or
6 hours to climb about 65 meters.

14:15.688 --> 14:19.317
Carried on way after it got dark.

14:19.318 --> 14:22.562
I was getting extremely cold,
'cause I was sitting still

14:22.563 --> 14:25.447
while Simon was trying to climb.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.327
I was getting near hypothermic.

14:28.328 --> 14:31.045
You just knew that if you'd
just carried on, regardless,

14:31.046 --> 14:33.870
it was gonna go tits up.

14:33.871 --> 14:38.042
So we dug a snow cave.

14:53.861 --> 14:56.190
In the morning, in good weather,

14:56.191 --> 15:00.361
we actually saw what
we'd been trying to climb.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.566
It was this undeering nightmare of

15:10.567 --> 15:14.737
flutings of the finest powder
gouged out by snow falling down

15:16.215 --> 15:20.385
meringues, and mushrooms, and
cornices all over the place.

15:22.722 --> 15:26.893
We'd heard about these strange powder
snow conditions you get in the Andes,

15:26.979 --> 15:29.814
and we've never seen it before.

15:29.815 --> 15:33.986
I don't know the physics that explains why
powder snow can stay on such steep slopes.

15:34.920 --> 15:39.091
In the Alps it would just slide off
if the slope was about 40 degrees.

15:44.305 --> 15:48.475
It is some of the most precarious, unnerving
and dangerous climbing I've ever done.

15:58.501 --> 16:01.629
We were actually scared, that
we would get to an impass,

16:01.630 --> 16:04.188
where we couldn't climb any further up.

16:04.189 --> 16:07.317
Because we knew we wouldn't
be able to get back down,

16:07.318 --> 16:07.710
not what we've already climbed.

16:07.711 --> 16:11.882
We were climbing ourselves into a trap.

16:12.999 --> 16:17.169
And not only that, we could see this
150 meter drop that was waiting for us.

16:27.060 --> 16:30.942
And so it was with great
relief that by 14:00,

16:30.943 --> 16:34.590
we got onto the north
ridge and on the west face.

16:34.592 --> 16:38.762
And we vowed that we didn't want to
go near any of the flutings again.

16:47.783 --> 16:51.954
We were pretty tired, by the
time we got onto the ridge,

16:53.465 --> 16:56.610
I was knackered. And
I remember thinking,

16:56.611 --> 16:58.414
"Oh sod it, we've done the face,"

16:58.415 --> 17:01.448
"now I can't really be bothered
to go all the way up there"

17:01.449 --> 17:05.619
And then we thought, "Hang
on, we've come all this way,"

17:06.516 --> 17:10.686
"we might as well stand on the top"

18:27.074 --> 18:31.245
I don't particularly like summits,
because 80% of accidents happen on descent.

18:38.395 --> 18:41.729
We decided before we even climbed the
face that we were going to come down

18:41.730 --> 18:44.037
the north ridge of the
mountain, down to a cul

18:44.038 --> 18:47.964
between the mountain Siula Grande
and another mountain called Yerupaja.

18:47.965 --> 18:52.136
and then we'd be able to abseil
down the smaller section of the face.

18:58.575 --> 19:02.746
Already the clouds were coming
in from the east. Big clouds.

19:11.193 --> 19:14.321
We expected this ridge to
be quite straightforward,

19:14.323 --> 19:15.631
quite an easy way to descend.

19:15.632 --> 19:18.411
We were hoping, we would
be able to sort of walk.

19:18.412 --> 19:22.291
And it turned out to be very difficult.

19:22.292 --> 19:24.485
It was horrendous.

19:24.486 --> 19:27.901
Vertical on the west side, with the
cornices overhanging the west side,

19:27.902 --> 19:32.073
and on the east side steep
fleetings running down 100m below us.

19:36.345 --> 19:39.252
It was a shock. And
it was quite dangerous.

19:39.253 --> 19:43.424
It all got a bit out of
control. That stage of things.

19:55.407 --> 19:59.139
Half an hour to an hour after
leaving the summit, we were lost.

19:59.140 --> 20:03.311
We were in the wild now,
we couldn't see anything.

20:12.395 --> 20:15.524
Then we got like a little break
in the clouds and I saw the ridge,

20:15.525 --> 20:19.695
so I started climbing back up to it.

20:29.051 --> 20:31.374
I didn't know it was the side
of the ridge I was on, but

20:31.375 --> 20:35.545
it was actually an enormous
cornice, an overhang of snow and ice,

20:36.223 --> 20:40.394
and I was walking up over the top of it.

21:00.576 --> 21:04.746
I was left hanging, looking
down, as all this snow and ice

21:05.035 --> 21:09.206
then fell away from me, down the
west side of the Siula Grande.

21:12.506 --> 21:15.634
I got back up on the ridge
and shouted then to Joe

21:15.635 --> 21:17.596
that I'd found the
ridge, like that, I said,

21:17.598 --> 21:21.767
"I found the ridge, Joe!"

21:22.365 --> 21:25.211
We'd hoped to go down that day,

21:25.212 --> 21:28.664
but by the time it got dark,
we were still very high.

21:28.665 --> 21:31.599
Still at 6000m.

21:31.600 --> 21:35.770
And that night, as we made
a brew, the gas ran out.

21:55.572 --> 21:57.411
It was pretty obvious
the following morning

21:57.412 --> 22:00.434
that we descended the
worst part of the ridge.

22:00.435 --> 22:04.606
And I was pretty confident that we'd
get back down to the base camp that day.

22:05.866 --> 22:10.037
I thought at that stage it was pretty
much in the bag I suppose, the whole climb.

22:12.505 --> 22:15.910
I was ahead of Simon,

22:15.911 --> 22:20.082
and suddenly there was this
vertical wall, bisecting the ridge.

22:21.489 --> 22:25.660
I then get on my hands and knees, and
hammer both my axes into the ice at the top

22:25.876 --> 22:30.047
and then lower myself off the ice cliff.

22:33.391 --> 22:37.561
When you hammer the axe in, you listen
to the sound it makes. And you look at it.

22:39.761 --> 22:43.461
Now I was hanging with both axes,
right. I took the hammer out, and

22:43.462 --> 22:45.745
what I wanted to do is now
place it in the vertical wall.

22:45.746 --> 22:49.917
And I swung, and the pick
went in, and it just made a...

22:50.775 --> 22:54.895
just a strange sound.

22:54.896 --> 22:57.762
And I thought, "Well, I'll take
it out, make a good placement."

22:57.764 --> 23:01.934
So I just wanted to put bona... dead
solid axe placements in. All the way down.

23:04.336 --> 23:08.506
And I was about to
swing at the ice again

23:25.746 --> 23:28.811
The pain is... came
flooding down my thigh

23:28.812 --> 23:32.983
and my knee was very, very very painful

23:37.360 --> 23:41.531
The impact drove my lower leg
straight through my knee joint.

23:45.390 --> 23:49.561
As the bone went into my tibia it
split the tibial plateau straight off

23:52.660 --> 23:56.831
and carried on up.

24:02.468 --> 24:06.639
Quite wild, the pain now. I
couldn't cope with it at first.

24:11.167 --> 24:14.589
I just breathed on and it started to
go and I can remember looking across

24:14.590 --> 24:17.749
to the west and seeing that we
were level with the summit of Rasac,

24:17.750 --> 24:20.954
so I had a height gauge, where we were.

24:20.955 --> 24:24.487
and I just thought, "fuck,
I can't have broken my leg",

24:24.488 --> 24:28.659
"If I have broken my leg I'm dead."

24:47.396 --> 24:50.071
And then the rope went slack.

24:50.072 --> 24:54.242
I knew that meant that
Simon was coming towards me.

25:07.805 --> 25:10.826
I couldn't feel any bone under anything.

25:10.827 --> 25:13.760
I brought my hand down,
there's no blood on it,

25:13.761 --> 25:15.189
and the pain had gone down a little bit.

25:15.190 --> 25:18.235
And I thought, maybe I
was being a bit whacked,

25:18.236 --> 25:22.407
I'd just torn a ligament or something.

25:26.108 --> 25:30.279
I tried to stand on it

25:30.945 --> 25:35.116
I felt all the bone go, all grating and
everything and I knew it was broken then.

25:46.505 --> 25:49.354
The look that he gave
to me sticks in my mind

25:49.355 --> 25:53.383
A look of shock and desperation
and a sort of terror.

25:53.384 --> 25:57.554
Lots of things in a single look.

25:58.447 --> 26:00.594
And he said, "Are you ok?"

26:00.595 --> 26:04.766
I think it did occur to me to say,
"Yeah, I'm fine". That was stupid.

26:05.658 --> 26:09.828
I think I said, "No,
I've broken my leg".

26:11.410 --> 26:15.581
Immediately, just doom. I
thought "god, we're stuffed".

26:18.141 --> 26:22.312
We're gonna be doing well if
either of us gets out of this now.

26:25.490 --> 26:27.225
It did come into my mind, just thinking,

26:27.226 --> 26:31.397
"If he slips off the side of the
mountain now, then I can just clear off,"

26:31.790 --> 26:35.961
"and leave him and get myself down and
I don't have to have all the hassle,"

26:36.957 --> 26:41.127
"of trying to deal with him and
with the situation we're in".

26:45.222 --> 26:48.350
He gave me these painkillers which
were effectively headache tablets.

26:48.351 --> 26:52.522
And he didn't really
talk about anything.

26:53.741 --> 26:57.688
It was almost as if he...
He knew, what this meant.

26:57.689 --> 27:01.860
He knew, and I knew, that he
was going to have to leave me.

27:04.066 --> 27:07.195
He could have said something like
"I'm just going to get some help"

27:07.196 --> 27:11.207
and I'd gone "right, yeah"

27:11.208 --> 27:13.424
'Cause I knew there wasn't any help.

27:13.425 --> 27:17.097
That'd been an easy
way for him to say it.

27:17.098 --> 27:21.269
I didn't think we really seriously
thought that there was any choice

27:30.876 --> 27:35.047
I couldn't put my finger on it, why
I thought something had happened.

27:36.706 --> 27:40.876
And I started to think "Is one of
them dead, or are both of them dead?"

27:42.476 --> 27:46.034
Even "If one of them is dead", not
"which one do I want to be dead", but

27:46.035 --> 27:50.206
"if one comes back,
who do I want it to be?"

27:51.508 --> 27:53.424
It's kind of, quite cold
to say it, but I guess

27:53.425 --> 27:57.595
I would rather have it
would have been Simon.

28:00.657 --> 28:04.827
I thought, "oh, he's not leaving"

28:08.727 --> 28:12.897
I calmed down a bit and
managed to focus myself again

28:13.089 --> 28:17.260
to think how I was going to
get him down the mountain.

28:20.702 --> 28:24.604
We discussed, between us, what
we were going to have to do.

28:24.605 --> 28:27.579
We thought, well, we got
2 ropes that are 50m long.

28:27.580 --> 28:31.751
And if we tie them together we have a
100m rope with a knot in the middle of it.

28:32.230 --> 28:35.359
So I tied to one end and
Simon tied to the other,

28:35.360 --> 28:39.531
in theory he could lower me down 100m.

28:42.181 --> 28:45.455
To really get anchors to
lower him from that do matter,

28:45.456 --> 28:49.627
what I did was cut a bucket in the
snow, sit in there and brace myself.

28:49.990 --> 28:54.161
And I sort of lay down between his legs.

28:55.503 --> 28:59.673
And Simon started lowering then.

29:03.642 --> 29:07.405
I'd lower him one rope length, 50m,

29:07.406 --> 29:10.174
and then the knot would come
up between the two ropes.

29:10.175 --> 29:13.382
Now the knot would not go
through the belay plates.

29:13.383 --> 29:15.246
So he would stop me.

29:15.247 --> 29:17.156
I would stand on my
left leg, my good leg,

29:17.157 --> 29:20.224
so that I could get
the weight off the rope.

29:20.225 --> 29:23.284
I gave him enough slack to
be able to unclip the rope

29:23.285 --> 29:27.455
thread the rope back through the lowering
device, with the knot on the other side

29:28.059 --> 29:32.230
clip it back to himself and
lower me the remaining 50m.

29:39.755 --> 29:43.925
He'd make himself reasonably secure,
and I down climbed to join him.

29:44.436 --> 29:48.606
And we'd repeat the process again.

29:50.980 --> 29:52.934
Simon was trying to lower me fast,

29:52.935 --> 29:57.106
and it meant that my foot kept jabbing
in and jabbing in and bending the knee.

29:58.856 --> 30:01.273
Excruciatingly painful.

30:01.274 --> 30:04.876
I can remember feeling angry with
him because he was hurting me,

30:04.877 --> 30:06.299
and I was thinking "do it slow",

30:06.300 --> 30:10.470
and I also knew that he had to do
it this fast. He hadn't got a choice.

30:12.138 --> 30:16.308
And he was very grim faced,
I remember looking at him,

30:17.847 --> 30:22.018
wondering if he was pissed
off with the whole thing.

30:22.693 --> 30:26.864
I couldn't take too much notice
unfortunately of these cries of pain,

30:27.468 --> 30:31.638
because we got to go down.

30:36.661 --> 30:39.980
We would dig these holes from
the sitting in the powder snow,

30:39.981 --> 30:44.111
and they would last about the length
of the time it took to lower me.

30:44.112 --> 30:46.768
And in fact they were
crumbling around him.

30:46.769 --> 30:50.796
And he was lowering me on a 9mm,
well 8.8mm rope. That's that thick.

30:50.797 --> 30:53.857
But hands sort of frozen.

30:53.858 --> 30:55.463
What he did was quite extraordinary,

30:55.464 --> 30:59.634
and I've never heard of any single
handed mountain rescue like that.

31:14.114 --> 31:17.931
We were now lowering in a full storm. I
don't know what the wind chill factor was,

31:17.932 --> 31:21.134
but it would be like -80
or something like that.

31:21.135 --> 31:25.306
I lost a liter of blood in my leg,
I was in shock and severly dehydrated

31:27.752 --> 31:31.532
It was a point where we should have
dug a snow cave and taken shelter,

31:31.533 --> 31:35.703
got in our sleeping bags and
made a hot brew, and rehydrate.

31:36.885 --> 31:39.278
We couldn't, 'cause we'd run out of gas.

31:39.279 --> 31:43.192
And we just lost control at this point
because we couldn't dig a snow cave,

31:43.193 --> 31:47.363
and risk getting trapped by
a storm that didn't break.

32:43.841 --> 32:48.011
It was all starting to look up in many ways
at that point, as we were virtually down.

32:54.580 --> 32:56.309
And I started to slowly think,

32:56.310 --> 33:00.481
"maybe after this one we will have
one more, and we'll be on the glacier".

33:02.777 --> 33:05.641
And suddenly all got hard
on my elbows, and icy,

33:05.642 --> 33:09.519
and it got steeper, going down a
slope and suddenly it's steeper,

33:09.520 --> 33:13.691
and I just was full of alarm.

33:16.464 --> 33:20.635
I was screaming at Simon to stop as loud
as I could, and he just couldn't hear me.

33:34.116 --> 33:38.085
I did notice that more
weight came onto the rope,

33:38.086 --> 33:41.214
but didn't really think a lot
about this. And I just thought,

33:41.215 --> 33:44.760
"Well, he's going over
some steeper ground"

33:44.761 --> 33:48.931
When I looked down, and I glimpsed
'cause there was a big drop underneath me,

33:50.945 --> 33:55.116
I was horrified to
discover what I'd gone over.

33:55.419 --> 33:59.590
And I could clearly see that there was
a large crevice directly under the cliff,

33:59.702 --> 34:03.872
about 25m below me.

34:04.900 --> 34:09.071
I was trying to get my axes to see if I
could reach this wall that was out there,

34:09.155 --> 34:13.326
I think, almost as I start and try to
do that, I started being lowered again.

34:15.168 --> 34:16.973
And I was thinking, "Christ,
don't do it, don't do it",

34:16.974 --> 34:21.145
'cause I knew, that there wasn't
enough rope to get me to the bottom.

34:21.634 --> 34:23.475
And if I couldn't get
my weight off the rope,

34:23.476 --> 34:25.565
he couldn't disconnect the
rope, to get on the other side.

34:25.567 --> 34:29.010
And I knew all this, and I was
screaming again, not to lower me.

34:29.011 --> 34:33.181
I carried on lowering him, until I
reached the knot, then shook the rope.

34:34.221 --> 34:38.391
My signal to him, to take
the weight off the rope.

34:40.116 --> 34:43.367
And nothing happened.

34:43.368 --> 34:47.538
And nothing continued to happen.

35:13.934 --> 35:18.104
I knew, that the only way out of
this is if I could climb up the rope.

35:33.233 --> 35:37.404
I had two prusik loops. Prusik
loops are thin cords of rope.

35:39.313 --> 35:43.484
And if you use a special twisting knot
on the rope, you can slide it up the rope,

35:44.387 --> 35:46.491
and pull on it, and
the knot grips the rope.

35:46.492 --> 35:49.756
Clip a snapping to it and then a
sling to it, and you can stand up.

35:49.757 --> 35:53.652
And if you got another one, tied
above it, you slide that one up,

35:53.653 --> 35:57.824
Standing this loop is now higher.

36:06.770 --> 36:10.800
I was trying to hold myself
upright, to keep the rope in place.

36:10.801 --> 36:13.740
And then trying to put this knot
through itself, and through itself,

36:13.741 --> 36:17.912
and this fiddly bloody rope... it is just
hard to describe how I couldn't do it.

36:17.961 --> 36:20.652
Because my fingers, I just
couldn't feel the fingers at all.

36:20.653 --> 36:24.414
And I'd be looking and trying to
push the thing in, and using my teeth,

36:24.415 --> 36:28.586
and getting it round,
and getting it round.

36:32.565 --> 36:36.735
My hands were cold, my feet
were... I was very very cold.

36:40.546 --> 36:44.452
It was a desperate position, made worse
by the fact that that I had no idea

36:44.454 --> 36:48.624
what Joe was doing, or
what position he was in.

36:48.950 --> 36:53.120
I just couldn't figure out why it was taking
him so long to get his weight off the rope,

36:55.271 --> 36:59.442
there was no sensible
explanation for it.

37:04.083 --> 37:08.253
I got one on, and I clipped it to my
chest, because that would keep me upright.

37:09.355 --> 37:13.526
And I tried to put the other one on,
and I had real trouble with my hands.

37:22.060 --> 37:26.231
And I dropped the bloody
thing, and I watched it fall.

37:27.268 --> 37:31.439
And I knew that I was stuffed then.

37:32.432 --> 37:35.221
I just thought, "Well,
I can't climb the rope",

37:35.222 --> 37:36.924
this idea that you can climb a
rope hand over hand, you can't,

37:36.925 --> 37:41.096
especially when your hands are
frozen. You just can't do it.

37:50.503 --> 37:54.674
Nothing I can do, and I
felt completely helpless.

37:55.043 --> 37:59.214
And really angry.

38:08.494 --> 38:12.421
There was nothing I could do. I
couldn't get the weight off the rope,

38:12.422 --> 38:16.593
I was just there, and this went
on for maybe an hour and a half,

38:17.196 --> 38:20.698
during which time my position
became more and more desperate.

38:20.699 --> 38:24.870
I was struggling to maintain the,
sort of shivery seat that I sat in,

38:26.973 --> 38:31.144
and the snow was gradually
sliding away from under me.

38:33.716 --> 38:37.886
So my position was getting desperate.

38:45.585 --> 38:49.756
I think psychologically I was beaten.

38:50.079 --> 38:51.942
'Cause there was nothing I could do,

38:51.943 --> 38:56.114
so I just hung on the
rope and waited to die.

38:57.368 --> 39:01.538
And I think I would have died pretty soon,
actually. The wind chill was very low.

39:15.524 --> 39:19.695
I was literally going down the
mountain in little, jerky stages.

39:20.476 --> 39:24.645
'Cause this soft, sugary snow
collapsed away underneath me.

39:26.598 --> 39:30.769
I was expecting him to come off,
and couldn't do anything about it.

39:31.180 --> 39:34.834
He was gonna fall about 100m.

39:34.835 --> 39:39.005
50m away from me, he was gonna
fall double that, he was gonna die.

39:41.169 --> 39:45.132
And he really didn't know, whether I was
meters off the ground, or centimeters,

39:45.133 --> 39:49.304
he just didn't know. But he knew, I
think, pretty sadly, that he was gonna die.

39:54.784 --> 39:58.954
Then I remembered that I've got a
pen knife in the top of my rucksack.

40:01.843 --> 40:06.014
I took the decision pretty quickly.

40:06.223 --> 40:10.393
To me, it just seemed like the right
thing to do under the circumstances.

40:15.115 --> 40:19.286
Because there was no way that
I could maintain where I was,

40:19.390 --> 40:23.560
sooner or later, I was going
to be pulled from the mountain.

40:26.557 --> 40:30.065
I took the rucksack off, and then
unzipped the top pocket with one hand,

40:30.066 --> 40:34.237
and got the pen knife out.

40:50.139 --> 40:54.309
Boof!

41:28.181 --> 41:30.163
It was an awful night.

41:30.164 --> 41:34.221
My mind was plagued with the
thoughts of what had happened to Joe.

41:34.222 --> 41:38.393
It took a long time to warm myself
up. And I didn't properly, I guess.

41:39.657 --> 41:43.828
Had a very, very cold night.

41:46.952 --> 41:51.032
The overriding memory is just feeling
desperately, desperately thirsty.

41:51.033 --> 41:55.203
To the point where I felt I could
smell the water in the snow around me.

41:56.848 --> 41:59.359
I felt that very strongly.

41:59.360 --> 42:03.531
It was quite a strange thing.

42:55.493 --> 42:57.438
I didn't know what had happened.

42:57.439 --> 43:00.568
What I landed on wasn't flat,
it was sloped on each side.

43:00.569 --> 43:04.740
And I was sliding, in the dark.

43:09.050 --> 43:13.121
I think I must have
fallen about 50m in total.

43:13.122 --> 43:17.293
I was pretty surprised to be alive.

43:31.201 --> 43:34.329
The head torch beam just
went down, and down, and down,

43:34.330 --> 43:38.501
and the darkness just ate it, just gone.

43:38.911 --> 43:42.451
I felt very unnerved,
very very vulnerable.

43:42.452 --> 43:46.623
If I had landed less than
1m further to the right,

43:47.145 --> 43:51.316
I would have just gone
down this huge hole.

43:52.857 --> 43:57.027
I got this ice screw in, pretty quickly.

44:04.695 --> 44:08.191
And then looked around, and thinking,

44:08.192 --> 44:12.361
"Jezus, it's gonna be nearly
impossible to get out of"

44:21.116 --> 44:25.287
My rope was going all the way up,
25m, up to this small entry hall.

44:25.472 --> 44:29.642
And I thought, Simon
is on the end of that.

44:31.683 --> 44:35.854
But I felt sure he was dead.
And it didn't mean anything.

44:35.987 --> 44:39.592
I just thought, "If I pull on this
rope, it will come tight on his body".

44:39.593 --> 44:43.763
Because he would have flown off the
cliff, on to the downside of the crevice,

44:44.097 --> 44:47.002
and then, Iying dead
there, like a counterweight,

44:47.003 --> 44:51.041
the rope would have come back up
and then dropped into the crevice.

44:51.042 --> 44:55.213
So I thought, if I pull on this
rope it will come tight on his body".

45:10.320 --> 45:14.490
And it just kept coming,
and coming, and coming,

45:29.140 --> 45:33.311
As soon as I saw it,
I knew it had been cut.

45:41.424 --> 45:45.594
I thought, "you're gonna die in here".

45:47.048 --> 45:51.219
I had a pleased feeling, that
it meant that Simon was alive.

45:54.833 --> 45:59.003
Simon!

46:09.123 --> 46:13.292
Looking where I was
was an awful prospect.

46:13.437 --> 46:17.608
You don't die of a broken leg.

46:27.550 --> 46:31.720
I think I did turn my head
torch off to save the batteries.

46:45.980 --> 46:50.151
It was dark, and it began to get to me.

46:59.124 --> 47:02.308
There is something about crevices,

47:02.309 --> 47:06.480
they have a dread feel, not
the place for the living.

47:14.586 --> 47:18.757
I could hear the ice cracking,
and wind noises in the ice.

47:23.377 --> 47:27.547
I turned the light on again,
'cause I didn't like it in the dark.

47:40.754 --> 47:44.924
I felt very, very alone.

47:46.326 --> 47:50.497
And I was very scared.

47:50.859 --> 47:55.030
I was 25, I was fit,
I was super ambitious.

47:58.508 --> 48:02.678
And this was the first trip I've
been on. I wanted to climb the world,

48:03.383 --> 48:07.554
and it just didn't seem... this
hadn't been part of our game plan.

48:14.462 --> 48:16.590
It must have been quite late.

48:16.591 --> 48:20.762
I think that I pretty much was
thinking that I wasn't gonna get out.

48:24.597 --> 48:28.768
Fuck. Stupid, stupid...

49:06.220 --> 49:10.391
As a climber you should always be in
control, you have to be in control.

49:10.820 --> 49:14.991
So doing that, you could be seen
as half a failure. You lost it.

49:38.645 --> 49:41.773
This is childish. I
just cried and cried.

49:41.774 --> 49:45.944
I thought,

49:47.250 --> 49:51.421
I'd be tougher than that.

50:20.425 --> 50:24.596
It was getting light, as it was 5 or 6.

50:25.541 --> 50:29.712
And I started screaming
Simon's name again.

50:34.726 --> 50:38.897
I got myself up, got dressed inside the
snow home and packed everything away,

50:45.373 --> 50:47.126
Just a horrible feeling of dread.

50:47.127 --> 50:51.297
By this stage, I strongly felt that
Joe had been killed the previous day.

50:51.970 --> 50:56.141
And that now I was going to
die, as some form of retribution.

51:00.264 --> 51:04.434
But rather than just sit here,
feeling sorry for myself or whatever,

51:05.295 --> 51:09.466
"I'll get on with it and
I'll die on the way down".

51:13.184 --> 51:15.837
Very quickly, the ground
dropped away steeply.

51:15.838 --> 51:20.008
So I skirted around this
area of steeper ground.

51:26.856 --> 51:30.388
As I abseiled down, I could
see this overhanging ice cliff,

51:30.390 --> 51:32.693
which was what I had lowered him over,

51:32.694 --> 51:35.575
so I knew that he'd had
actually been hanging in space,

51:35.576 --> 51:39.747
which is the reason he couldn't
get his weight off the rope.

51:41.473 --> 51:44.252
And as I went down lower,
I could see to my horror,

51:44.253 --> 51:48.423
that the base of this ice cliff
was an absolutely enormous crevice,

51:50.380 --> 51:54.551
that's 12m wide and just bottomless
from where I was looking at it.

52:01.933 --> 52:05.075
SIMON!

52:05.076 --> 52:07.001
He would have been up with
first light, I thought.

52:07.002 --> 52:09.375
'Cause I was desperately,
desperately thirsty.

52:09.376 --> 52:13.547
And he would have been. And he would
have wanted to get down, and get water.

52:14.447 --> 52:17.158
And he would have wanted to find me.

52:17.159 --> 52:20.750
Now I did stop and pause, and I
shouted across into the crevice,

52:20.751 --> 52:24.922
and I yelled and yelled, "Joe, Joe".

52:25.146 --> 52:29.316
And I suppose again, with
the benefit of hindsight,

52:29.404 --> 52:33.574
after I got off the rope, I
should have gone and looked,

52:33.627 --> 52:37.007
into the crevice, to see where he was.

52:37.008 --> 52:41.179
But to be quite honest, the thought
didn't occur to me at that time.

52:43.700 --> 52:47.871
I was just convinced he was dead.

52:54.388 --> 52:58.559
Absolutely convinced, by 10, totally
convinced, that I was on my own.

53:00.808 --> 53:04.978
That no one was coming to get me.

53:09.205 --> 53:12.759
I was brought up as a devout Catholic.

53:12.760 --> 53:15.746
I had long since
stopped believing in God.

53:15.747 --> 53:19.917
I always wondered, if things really hit
the fan, whether I would, under pressure,

53:20.935 --> 53:25.106
turn around and say a few Hail
Mary's, and say "get me out of here".

53:27.565 --> 53:31.263
It never once occurred to me.

53:31.264 --> 53:33.741
It meant that I really don't believe.

53:33.742 --> 53:37.912
And I really do think that when you die,
you die. That's it, there's no afterlife.

53:38.600 --> 53:42.771
There's nothing.

53:45.680 --> 53:49.850
And I was thinking, "Could
I climb out of here?"

54:36.335 --> 54:40.506
25 meter of overhanging ice. No way,
I couldn't do it with a good leg.

54:44.335 --> 54:48.506
I knew that they were both dead. But I
couldn't just clear off and leave the camp.

54:50.977 --> 54:54.128
For one thing, I didn't
know anything about them,

54:54.129 --> 54:56.982
except for their first
names, Joe and Simon.

54:56.983 --> 55:01.093
I didn't know their family names,
I really knew nothing about them.

55:01.095 --> 55:05.036
And I had this bizarre idea, that
if they'd fallen off the mountain,

55:05.037 --> 55:08.452
they would have just
landed at the bottom of it.

55:08.453 --> 55:12.624
And I thought, perhaps from the bottom
of the glacier, I'd be able to see them.

55:14.230 --> 55:18.401
And set off with the aim
of going as far as I could.

55:21.208 --> 55:24.419
I started to go down
the glacier on my own.

55:24.420 --> 55:28.591
In this stage I was still certain
that I was gonna die myself.

55:29.751 --> 55:33.357
Crossing a glacier is very
very dangerous on your own,

55:33.358 --> 55:37.528
because there are crevices in
the ice, and the snow covers them.

55:39.022 --> 55:42.509
Fortunately I managed to find
a faint outline of our tracks,

55:42.510 --> 55:45.665
from when we walked in.

55:45.666 --> 55:49.837
It was only when I got off the glacier,
I realized that I was going to get down,

55:51.982 --> 55:54.343
I was going to get out of it,

55:54.344 --> 55:58.515
I was gonna live.

56:08.975 --> 56:13.146
I can't really describe how
scary the night had been.

56:18.445 --> 56:22.615
I thought, it would
be like that, for days.

56:25.166 --> 56:28.507
You gotta make decisions, you
gotta keep making decisions,

56:28.508 --> 56:32.679
even if they're wrong decisions.

56:33.638 --> 56:37.808
If you don't make
decisions you're stuffed.

56:54.479 --> 56:58.650
Short of dying on the
ledge, my only chance was to

56:59.713 --> 57:03.884
lower myself deeper into the crevice.

57:03.907 --> 57:07.215
I didn't what I would find down there.

57:07.216 --> 57:11.386
I was just hoping there might be some
way out of the labyrinth of ice and snow.

57:16.923 --> 57:21.094
And I really struggled to make that
decision, I was so scared of going deeper.

57:32.372 --> 57:35.463
The other option was
to just to sit there,

57:35.464 --> 57:37.760
blindly hoping that
somehow it might get better,

57:37.761 --> 57:41.931
and I just knew it wasn't
going to get better.

58:08.658 --> 58:11.930
I didn't want to look down,

58:11.931 --> 58:16.102
I was horrified at the thought
that it was just empty down there.

58:34.023 --> 58:37.056
I didn't put a knot
near the end of the rope,

58:37.057 --> 58:40.953
and if there was nothing down there
I wouldn't be able to hold the rope,

58:40.954 --> 58:45.125
and then I would fall,
and it would be quick.

59:06.212 --> 59:10.382
And I thought "Jesus, this is big!"

59:20.433 --> 59:24.604
By this stage I was
completely physically done in,

59:25.500 --> 59:29.671
staggering back down these
meringues, still desperately thirsty.

59:30.964 --> 59:33.492
There werre all these sort of
thoughts swirling around in my mind,

59:33.493 --> 59:37.664
guilt, worry, thinking about how on earth
am I going to explain this to Joe's parents,

59:39.719 --> 59:43.889
my friends, to Richard.

59:44.969 --> 59:49.132
The thought did cross my mind that
maybe I could think up a decent story,

59:49.133 --> 59:53.304
that would make me look better.

59:53.596 --> 59:57.766
And I did quite think about
that, for quite a while.

01:00:04.235 --> 01:00:08.406
Really the only image that sticks
in my mind from all the time in Peru,

01:00:09.304 --> 01:00:12.940
is seeing this figure.

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:17.112
And it was fairly close
before I could see who it was.

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:24.309
But he looked absolutely horrendous.

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:28.480
You wouldn't recognize him.

01:00:30.489 --> 01:00:34.257
And I said, "Where is Joe?"

01:00:34.258 --> 01:00:36.976
And he just said, "Joe is dead".

01:00:36.978 --> 01:00:41.147
I told him the whole story,
as we walked back to the camp,

01:00:41.274 --> 01:00:45.445
I told him the whole
story of what had happened.

01:00:45.586 --> 01:00:49.757
He wasn't in the slightest bit
judgemental about me or what I'd done,

01:00:54.149 --> 01:00:58.319
he took it very well.

01:01:12.778 --> 01:01:16.949
I must have lowered myself about 25m from
where the ice screw was at the bridge.

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:28.956
I was now in what seemed to
be the base of the crevice,

01:01:28.957 --> 01:01:32.277
that was shaped like a big hourglass.

01:01:32.278 --> 01:01:35.305
To the ceiling, was probably about 50m.

01:01:35.306 --> 01:01:39.477
I think it's as big as the
St. Paul's dome in scale.

01:01:41.922 --> 01:01:46.093
I remember looking down, and
there was just solid snow.

01:01:46.363 --> 01:01:50.534
And I thought, "this is
the bottom of the crevice!"

01:01:55.802 --> 01:01:59.972
About 15m away from me,
there was a slope leading up.

01:02:01.279 --> 01:02:05.450
Right at the top, there was the
sun coming through this hole.

01:02:06.929 --> 01:02:11.100
And it was shining, just this
big beam of sunlight coming in.

01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:18.801
This was the way out
I'd been looking for!

01:02:20.483 --> 01:02:24.654
I remember thinking, "Whoo, I can climb that
slope, I bloody well will climb that slope!"

01:02:27.406 --> 01:02:31.576
I crawled across this flat floor, and
I started crawling across on my stomach.

01:02:43.406 --> 01:02:47.577
Then I heard things
breaking away underneath me.

01:02:48.783 --> 01:02:52.954
I realized that this wasn't a solid floor,
it seemed to be hollow underneath it.

01:02:56.886 --> 01:03:01.056
I was absolutely horrified.

01:03:02.805 --> 01:03:06.976
It was suddenly, as if
I was on an egg shell.

01:03:08.615 --> 01:03:12.786
If I break through, I'll never be
able to get across to this slope,

01:03:13.028 --> 01:03:17.198
and that was my way out.

01:03:33.079 --> 01:03:37.250
Alright, I'm on it, this is solid now.

01:03:42.708 --> 01:03:46.878
I started to get my axe in and hop up.

01:03:50.821 --> 01:03:54.991
That is extremely painful, as your legs
hopped up, they both came down together.

01:03:58.646 --> 01:04:02.816
I was trying to get into a better
position, so that my left foot ain't first.

01:04:03.981 --> 01:04:08.152
But I inevitably went
onto my broken leg.

01:04:09.081 --> 01:04:12.250
I feel the displacement
go, the bone move,

01:04:12.251 --> 01:04:16.254
so every hop I nearly faint.

01:04:16.255 --> 01:04:20.426
It was just excruciatingly painful.

01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:18.294
And it was a bright sunny day.

01:05:18.295 --> 01:05:22.466
Wow, the whole world has come back.

01:05:24.958 --> 01:05:29.129
I was Iying on the snow, just laughing.

01:05:37.686 --> 01:05:41.857
That was the relief of
getting out that place.

01:06:16.507 --> 01:06:19.635
And I then looked at the
glacier and I thought,

01:06:19.636 --> 01:06:21.743
"Well, you haven't even started, mate".

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:25.915
It's kilometers and kilometers
and on really bad ground.

01:06:45.191 --> 01:06:49.361
But I think I was contemplating just
sitting there, because I was coming at this,

01:06:50.065 --> 01:06:54.236
having done the most
serious climb in my life.

01:06:54.282 --> 01:06:58.029
You come down safe from a climb like
that, you'd be exhausted for days.

01:06:58.030 --> 01:07:01.666
You'd just eat and drink and sleep.

01:07:01.667 --> 01:07:05.837
I'd just come out of that, I'd badly
broken a leg, I was in great pain,

01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:11.821
highly dehydrated, I had no food, and
I was looking at trying to do that.

01:07:12.214 --> 01:07:16.385
Just no way, just no way
you're physically gonna do that.

01:07:17.218 --> 01:07:21.389
And then it occurred to me that
I should set definite targets.

01:07:24.179 --> 01:07:26.998
I started to look at things and think,

01:07:26.999 --> 01:07:30.520
"right, if I can get to that
crevice over there in 20 minutes",

01:07:30.521 --> 01:07:33.973
"that's what I'm gonna do".

01:07:33.974 --> 01:07:38.145
If I got there in 18 minutes I
was hysterically happy about it,

01:07:38.446 --> 01:07:42.617
and if I'd gotten 22 or 24 minutes, I
was upset almost to the point of tears,

01:07:42.995 --> 01:07:47.166
and it became obsessive.

01:07:48.663 --> 01:07:52.834
I don't know why I did it, I think I knew
the big picture of what had happened to me,

01:07:53.657 --> 01:07:57.828
and what I had to do was so
big I couldn't deal with it.

01:08:41.778 --> 01:08:45.319
I stayed on Simon's tracks, and
they were weaving around over humps,

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:47.718
and past obvious crevices and stuff.

01:08:47.719 --> 01:08:51.428
I thought, "Well, unless I come to a
hole with his body in the bottom of it,"

01:08:51.429 --> 01:08:55.600
"these tracks will lead me
through the minefield of crevices".

01:09:05.029 --> 01:09:09.200
All these huge mountains
around you, big mountain walls.

01:09:10.685 --> 01:09:13.776
And they do make you
feel small and vulnerable.

01:09:13.777 --> 01:09:17.948
And you wonder whether there's
some malign presence out to get you.

01:09:31.764 --> 01:09:34.737
It was like somebody
was just teasing an ant,

01:09:34.738 --> 01:09:36.448
and putting something
in its way all the time,

01:09:36.448 --> 01:09:40.620
and eventually gonna stand on it.

01:10:41.421 --> 01:10:45.126
I could see Simon's
tracks were filling in.

01:10:45.127 --> 01:10:49.298
They were my lifeline off the glacier.

01:10:49.811 --> 01:10:53.981
And I started to get very desperate.

01:11:08.775 --> 01:11:12.593
I carried on crawling in the dark, a stupid
thing to do on the slope of the glacier.

01:11:12.594 --> 01:11:16.765
But I was frightened and I was
just trying to see Simon's tracks.

01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:44.266
In the morning, it was a bright,
sunny day, all the tracks had gone.

01:11:54.217 --> 01:11:56.650
I started quite early,

01:11:56.651 --> 01:12:00.822
and every now and then I had to stand
up on one leg to try see the way,

01:12:00.826 --> 01:12:04.997
and then sit down again, and shuffle on.

01:12:34.448 --> 01:12:38.418
There was one very horrendous
crevice bit right near the edge,

01:12:38.419 --> 01:12:42.590
and I got into a maze of them.

01:13:08.239 --> 01:13:12.410
I suddenly came to a point where I could
see ice running down, then I could see rocks.

01:13:24.849 --> 01:13:29.020
It was probably me, who brought
up the subject of leaving.

01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:31.792
Partly 'cause I was worried about Simon.

01:13:31.793 --> 01:13:35.964
I just felt it was best to get as far away
as possible from where it had happened.

01:13:39.864 --> 01:13:42.519
I didn't want to leave immediately,

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:46.691
I felt I needed a day or two
just to collect my thoughts,

01:13:48.271 --> 01:13:52.442
and to regain some strength.

01:13:57.621 --> 01:14:01.792
Spend a long time washing myself.

01:14:06.145 --> 01:14:10.315
That felt good, to wash my hair and
to wash my face, to have a shave, to...

01:14:13.696 --> 01:14:17.105
get the...

01:14:17.106 --> 01:14:21.277
get the remnants, the
mountain out of my system.

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:57.783
I was desperately thirsty, because it
doesn't matter how much snow you eat,

01:14:57.784 --> 01:15:01.955
you just can't get enough
water into your system.

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:06.368
And I saw the rocks, I knew how big these
boulders would be and how far it was,

01:15:06.533 --> 01:15:09.660
and that was the first time
that I really thought about,

01:15:09.661 --> 01:15:13.832
whether I could get the distance.

01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:22.461
I got rid of all my gear.

01:15:36.102 --> 01:15:40.003
I knew that I couldn't crawl over these
rocks, they were just too big and jumbled,

01:15:40.004 --> 01:15:44.175
and that the only way to
do it was to try and hop.

01:15:45.235 --> 01:15:49.406
I knew I was gonna fall a lot.

01:16:45.383 --> 01:16:47.453
I'd fallen virtually every hop,

01:16:47.454 --> 01:16:50.970
and it's just like having your leg
broken about every time, and I remember

01:16:50.971 --> 01:16:55.010
looking back where I'd come
from, it was just over 20m,

01:16:55.011 --> 01:16:59.181
and it had taken me ages. And
the pain, just of the 20+m...

01:17:12.012 --> 01:17:15.179
I can be insanely stubborn.

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:19.295
And I do like to have things my way.

01:17:19.296 --> 01:17:23.467
And things were seriously not
going my way over these days.

01:17:29.942 --> 01:17:34.113
I'd look at a rock and then I'd go,
"Right, I get there in 20 minutes".

01:17:35.285 --> 01:17:39.395
Once I decided I was going to
get that distance in 20 minutes,

01:17:39.396 --> 01:17:43.566
I bloody well was gonna do it.

01:17:44.829 --> 01:17:47.958
And it would help me, because I'd
get halfway through the distance,

01:17:47.959 --> 01:17:49.269
and I'd be in such pain,

01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:52.910
I just couldn't bear the thought
of getting up and falling on again,

01:17:52.911 --> 01:17:57.081
but I'd look at the target and
think "I've got to get there".

01:18:07.576 --> 01:18:10.140
And I'd think, when I was
Iying a bit long, and I think,

01:18:10.141 --> 01:18:14.311
"no, you gotta get there. You only got
10 minutes left, only 10 minutes left!"

01:18:16.675 --> 01:18:20.845
It seemed like there was a very cold,
pragmatic part of me that was saying,

01:18:21.678 --> 01:18:25.848
"You have to do this, this and
this, if you're gonna get there".

01:18:41.656 --> 01:18:45.826
"Come on, keep moving, keep moving"

01:18:52.072 --> 01:18:56.243
"Right, get up, and do it again"

01:19:00.977 --> 01:19:05.148
It was quite insistent, and quite clear.

01:19:06.046 --> 01:19:10.217
It was almost like a voice or a separate
part of me, telling me to do something.

01:19:14.617 --> 01:19:18.175
Very uncaring. No sympathy,

01:19:18.176 --> 01:19:22.347
no acknowledgement of the fact
that I might be tired or hurt.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:27.651
It was very, very odd.

01:19:36.259 --> 01:19:40.430
That part of me kept saying, "Keep
moving, stop resting, keep moving",

01:19:41.512 --> 01:19:45.682
and the other part of me, my
mind, anyway, just was, "Alright.",

01:19:46.233 --> 01:19:48.851
looking around and absorbing things.

01:19:48.852 --> 01:19:51.980
And as the hours went, and
certainly as the days started to go,

01:19:51.981 --> 01:19:56.152
it became weirder and weirder.

01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:47.179
So I was very, very, very
thirsty. Very dehydrated.

01:20:50.581 --> 01:20:54.288
And the agonizing thing is, all
these boulders, these meringues,

01:20:54.289 --> 01:20:58.460
are on top of the glacier. And
you could hear water running.

01:20:58.858 --> 01:21:03.028
All the time.

01:21:08.773 --> 01:21:12.944
I'd fall over a lot and I'd hear water and
I'd start digging around searching for it.

01:21:37.029 --> 01:21:39.189
Couldn't find it, couldn't get it.

01:21:39.190 --> 01:21:43.361
And it was driving me mad,
to be able to hear water.

01:22:08.262 --> 01:22:10.465
I was worried about Simon.

01:22:10.466 --> 01:22:14.637
About his health, 'cause his fingertips
were still quite bad from frostbite.

01:22:16.482 --> 01:22:20.653
And I just felt it wasn't
a place to be lingering in.

01:22:21.519 --> 01:22:25.690
We just started getting
ready to leave in the morning.

01:22:32.371 --> 01:22:36.542
I did eventually collapse amidst the
rocks, and I didn't sleep very well.

01:22:36.698 --> 01:22:40.864
My leg was very painful. It was agony.

01:22:40.865 --> 01:22:43.765
It was the first night, I
think, it hadn't stormed.

01:22:43.766 --> 01:22:47.936
It didn't snow on me, and it didn't
rain. And I could see the stars.

01:22:48.221 --> 01:22:52.392
I can remember Iying on my back for
what seemed endless periods of time,

01:22:52.927 --> 01:22:57.098
staring at the stars.

01:22:57.425 --> 01:23:01.305
At one point I had this weird sensation
that I had been lain there, conscious,

01:23:01.306 --> 01:23:04.066
for centuries, for lifetimes.

01:23:04.067 --> 01:23:08.238
Becoming part of the rocks, and part
of where I was never gonna move from.

01:23:31.057 --> 01:23:33.932
The sun came up, and
it started to warm me.

01:23:33.933 --> 01:23:38.104
And I thought it'd be just so nice to
just lie there, don't move, and never hurt,

01:23:38.861 --> 01:23:43.032
and christ, I got so,
so close to doing that.

01:23:50.884 --> 01:23:54.012
I genuinely believed that I
wouldn't make the distance,

01:23:54.013 --> 01:23:56.099
and I also believed
that I was going to die,

01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:00.271
and I sort of acknowledged it
in a very matter-of-fact way.

01:24:03.473 --> 01:24:05.574
And it seemed very rational
to keep on crawling,

01:24:05.575 --> 01:24:09.746
if you didn't think it
was gonna be of any good.

01:24:11.555 --> 01:24:15.726
I think that it was that loneliness,
that sense of being abandoned.

01:24:16.419 --> 01:24:20.589
It was there all the time.

01:24:22.386 --> 01:24:25.808
I didn't crawl, because
I thought I would survive,

01:24:25.809 --> 01:24:29.980
I think I wanted to be
with somebody when I died.

01:24:58.713 --> 01:25:02.884
Probably just a symbolic act to
say goodbye to him, in my own mind,

01:25:05.796 --> 01:25:09.967
by doing that.

01:26:13.806 --> 01:26:17.977
I drank liters and liters of it.

01:26:20.654 --> 01:26:23.338
And it was just like putting fuel in,

01:26:23.339 --> 01:26:27.510
I could feel myself immediately
just getting stronger.

01:27:34.668 --> 01:27:36.119
I kept wetting myself.

01:27:36.121 --> 01:27:40.291
And I can remember actually quite
liking the sensation, the warmth of it.

01:27:46.575 --> 01:27:50.746
It was just a slow, steady reduction.

01:27:52.031 --> 01:27:55.159
Not just physically.
Physically is very obvious,

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.181
but you, everything, yourself.

01:27:58.182 --> 01:28:01.551
I felt left with nothing.

01:28:01.552 --> 01:28:05.723
And I didn't care anymore.

01:28:05.788 --> 01:28:09.958
Didn't have any dignity, you didn't care
whether you're brave or weak or anything.

01:28:11.392 --> 01:28:15.563
You just became almost
nothing. It was strange.

01:28:25.181 --> 01:28:29.352
I was still doing these test 20
minutes things, get here, get there.

01:28:31.387 --> 01:28:35.558
And then I saw these footprints.

01:28:36.523 --> 01:28:40.456
Then I got convinced, that
it was Simon and Richard.

01:28:40.457 --> 01:28:43.585
They were up above me, and
they were just following on,

01:28:43.586 --> 01:28:47.199
and I carried on crawling down,

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:51.371
utterly convinced that they
were wandering along behind me.

01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:57.381
And I can remember thinking, "that is
really stupid, they would come and help you",

01:28:58.595 --> 01:29:01.402
and I think I persuaded myself
that they were just following on,

01:29:01.404 --> 01:29:05.574
because they didn't want to embarass me
'cause I peed myself and I was crying.

01:29:08.211 --> 01:29:12.381
I don't know how long it
lasted, maybe about an hour.

01:29:13.925 --> 01:29:18.096
I totally believed it, and then
suddenly it was like popping a bubble.

01:29:21.589 --> 01:29:25.759
And then I realized that they weren't
there, and I felt utterly shattered.

01:29:39.802 --> 01:29:43.973
It was about 4 o'clock
when I reached the lake.

01:29:45.719 --> 01:29:49.816
And I that at the far end of
it, there was a meringue dam.

01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:51.291
And from the top of that meringue dam,

01:29:51.292 --> 01:29:55.462
I would be able to look down into
the valley where the base camp was.

01:29:55.850 --> 01:29:59.696
In fact, I would be
able to see the tents.

01:29:59.698 --> 01:30:01.248
This was the first time I thought it,

01:30:01.249 --> 01:30:05.420
I thought, "I'm gonna make the distance,
I can actually make the distance".

01:30:08.668 --> 01:30:12.839
Almost as soon I thought it, the next
thought that popped into my head was,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.114
"Will there be anyone there?"

01:30:17.115 --> 01:30:21.286
I thought, "Christ, this is the
fourth day since I saw Simon",

01:30:23.882 --> 01:30:28.053
and as I worked it out, I thought,
"Why on earth would they be there?"

01:30:31.262 --> 01:30:35.087
I knew it got dark at six, and thought
"I got to get there, I got to get there",

01:30:35.088 --> 01:30:39.258
and I was trying to do
it as fast as possible.

01:30:44.405 --> 01:30:46.071
The rest of that afternoon,

01:30:46.072 --> 01:30:50.243
I was plagued by this dreadful
feeling that they would have gone.

01:30:54.562 --> 01:30:58.733
I hadn't paid attention to what
was happening with the weather.

01:30:59.164 --> 01:31:02.550
Between leaving at four and getting
to the top of the meringues, about six,

01:31:02.551 --> 01:31:05.483
the weather had changed.

01:31:05.485 --> 01:31:09.654
So when I looked down at the
valley, it was just full of clouds.

01:31:14.547 --> 01:31:18.718
I listened intently, hoping to hear a
whistle or an answer, a cry back, something,

01:31:19.963 --> 01:31:24.133
and I didn't hear anything at all.

01:31:30.515 --> 01:31:34.686
and I spend a long time, sat
there, crying, not sure what to do.

01:31:36.511 --> 01:31:40.274
I thought about getting
in my sleeping bag.

01:31:40.275 --> 01:31:43.558
For some reason it just seemed a
bit of a pathetic way to end things,

01:31:43.559 --> 01:31:47.730
just in a sleeping bag.

01:31:47.996 --> 01:31:52.167
I thought, "Well, nice but just keep
going, you'll end it down there, somewhere".

01:32:03.439 --> 01:32:07.610
I don't know entirely what
happened for the rest of that night.

01:32:11.385 --> 01:32:15.556
I stopped looking at the watch, and
everything just started to go apart.

01:32:36.218 --> 01:32:39.300
And I think I just got lost.

01:32:39.301 --> 01:32:43.471
And I didn't know what
I was doing anymore.

01:32:45.198 --> 01:32:49.369
I don't remember thinking of anyone,

01:32:49.891 --> 01:32:54.062
anybody I loved or any of that.

01:32:56.979 --> 01:33:00.756
I did have one time, when I got
a song going through my head.

01:33:00.757 --> 01:33:04.133
And it was by a band called Boney M.

01:33:04.134 --> 01:33:08.305
And I don't really like Boney M's music.

01:33:36.153 --> 01:33:40.026
<i>Brown girl in the ring,</i>

01:33:40.027 --> 01:33:44.197
<i>there's a brown girl in the ring,</i>

01:33:45.545 --> 01:33:49.481
<i>brown girl in the ring,</i>

01:33:49.482 --> 01:33:53.082
<i>she looks like a sugar in a plum,</i>

01:33:53.083 --> 01:33:54.927
<i>plum, plum!</i>

01:33:54.928 --> 01:33:59.097
<i>Show me your motion,</i>

01:34:00.422 --> 01:34:04.593
<i>come on show me your motion,</i>

01:34:05.236 --> 01:34:07.832
<i>show me your motion,</i>

01:34:07.833 --> 01:34:12.003
And it just went on and
on and on, for hours.

01:34:13.794 --> 01:34:17.719
I found it very upsetting, 'cause I
wanted to try and get it out of my head.

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:21.891
And I wanted to think of other things.

01:34:28.104 --> 01:34:32.275
I was thinking, "Bloody hell,
I'm gonna die to Boney M".

01:34:48.083 --> 01:34:51.058
I remember sometimes not waking up,

01:34:51.059 --> 01:34:55.230
I think I was awake all the time,
but coming to, it was like waking up,

01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:58.743
and sort of find myself sitting there,

01:34:58.744 --> 01:35:02.307
I didn't know where I was.

01:35:02.308 --> 01:35:05.605
It was pitch black and snowing, and
I'd think I was back on the glacier,

01:35:05.606 --> 01:35:09.192
or I'd think I was in a public car
park, and had been beaten up again,

01:35:09.193 --> 01:35:13.363
and then I'd just drift off again.

01:35:24.857 --> 01:35:28.971
I remember smelling something.

01:35:28.972 --> 01:35:32.304
It was a really strong smell.

01:35:32.305 --> 01:35:36.476
And it acted like a smelling salt,
to cut through all this delerium.

01:35:40.013 --> 01:35:43.140
And I remember being really confused,
I couldn't understand what it meant.

01:35:43.141 --> 01:35:46.389
It took me ages to to try
and work out what it meant.

01:35:46.391 --> 01:35:49.879
I thought it was me.

01:35:49.881 --> 01:35:52.212
And very slowly, I worked
it out, and I thought,

01:35:52.213 --> 01:35:56.384
"I've crawled through the
latrine area of our camp site".

01:35:58.894 --> 01:36:03.065
And I realized then, that
I was close to the tents.

01:36:13.125 --> 01:36:17.295
As I was shouting it, I thought, "This
is it, this is as far as this game goes".

01:36:22.618 --> 01:36:26.789
I'm not capable of going any further.

01:36:31.643 --> 01:36:35.814
I made the mistake of having a little
bit of hope, that they'd still be there.

01:36:37.530 --> 01:36:41.129
And when I shouted,
and they weren't there,

01:36:41.130 --> 01:36:45.300
I sort of knew I was dead then.

01:36:58.197 --> 01:37:02.367
That moment, when no
one answered the call,

01:37:13.099 --> 01:37:17.269
it was... I lost something.

01:37:20.324 --> 01:37:24.495
I lost me.

01:37:26.961 --> 01:37:30.410
I woke up, not knowing why.

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:33.875
And was aware of this
kind of strange atmosphere,

01:37:33.876 --> 01:37:37.326
I could hear the wind
howling outside the tent.

01:37:37.327 --> 01:37:41.498
And started hearing something.

01:37:44.472 --> 01:37:46.644
It did slowly dawn on me,

01:37:46.645 --> 01:37:49.465
that really the only thing it could be,

01:37:49.466 --> 01:37:53.237
would be Joe outside shouting.

01:37:53.238 --> 01:37:57.409
But that was completely
impossible, because he was dead,

01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:02.050
and he died 3 or 4 days ago.

01:38:02.424 --> 01:38:06.595
And then head it again, much sharper,

01:38:07.038 --> 01:38:11.209
and it really sounded like
somebody shouting. Simon.

01:38:15.886 --> 01:38:19.375
I can have gotten into a panic,
but first, it couldn't be Joe,

01:38:19.376 --> 01:38:22.417
because Joe's dead.

01:38:22.418 --> 01:38:26.589
And then, if he is out there,
it's gonna be this horrible thing,

01:38:28.734 --> 01:38:31.321
it can't be a human being, because,

01:38:31.322 --> 01:38:35.493
no human being can possibly go
through that, and be outside the tent.

01:38:41.498 --> 01:38:45.669
I was just kind of Iying there,
really not knowing what to do.

01:38:46.311 --> 01:38:48.929
And then Simon woke up.

01:38:48.930 --> 01:38:53.101
"Simon!", it was quite
clearly a shout of my name.

01:38:54.069 --> 01:38:58.240
I knew it was Joe actually,
I knew immediately.

01:38:59.302 --> 01:39:03.472
I was looking around, and then
I saw this thing, floating.

01:39:07.904 --> 01:39:12.075
Of course Simon exploded into action.

01:39:14.435 --> 01:39:18.605
Suddenly I heard voices.

01:39:19.337 --> 01:39:20.902
Is that you?

01:39:20.903 --> 01:39:25.073
I was holding back, because I didn't
feel that was a human being out there.

01:39:41.771 --> 01:39:45.939
And we went back up the stream, right
from where these cries had come from,

01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:50.109
about maybe 60-80 m outside
the camp, and there was Joe.

01:39:57.042 --> 01:40:01.212
I couldn't completely believe
it, until I actually saw him,

01:40:01.648 --> 01:40:04.776
but then it was still a little
difficult to believe that,

01:40:04.777 --> 01:40:08.947
because of the eerie night
and the state he was in.

01:40:09.441 --> 01:40:11.695
Absolutely awful state.

01:40:11.696 --> 01:40:15.413
It was almost like he was
a sort of ghost-like figure.

01:40:15.415 --> 01:40:19.584
It was like I had to sort of pinch
myself almost to believe this was true,

01:40:21.986 --> 01:40:25.114
that this was really happening.

01:40:25.115 --> 01:40:29.286
Help me!
- Oh fuck, Joe!

01:40:30.888 --> 01:40:33.838
Simon,

01:40:33.839 --> 01:40:38.010
he was swearing a lot. Swearing a lot.

01:40:39.537 --> 01:40:41.506
Richard, lift him!

01:40:41.507 --> 01:40:45.678
Richard, hold him, you
stupid bastard! Lift him!

01:40:46.284 --> 01:40:50.453
I remember Simon grabbing my shoulders,

01:40:51.171 --> 01:40:55.080
and holding me.

01:40:55.081 --> 01:40:57.961
I remember that.

01:40:57.962 --> 01:41:02.133
That feeling of being held.

01:41:25.026 --> 01:41:29.197
He thanked me for trying to
get him down the mountain,

01:41:32.072 --> 01:41:36.242
for all that I'd done up to the point,

01:41:36.759 --> 01:41:40.200
where I cut the rope,

01:41:40.201 --> 01:41:44.372
and he said to me, "I'd
have done the same".

01:41:47.143 --> 01:41:51.313
Those were the first
words he uttered to me.

01:42:02.196 --> 01:42:06.058
And I remember, before we'd done anything
to him, before we'd even close the door,

01:42:06.059 --> 01:42:08.586
he said, "Where are my trousers?"

01:42:08.588 --> 01:42:12.758
We had to explain, that we burned his
trousers, which made him quite angry.

01:42:14.846 --> 01:42:19.017
And I think that kind of brought
me back into life, to some extend.

01:42:19.055 --> 01:42:23.225
realizing it was the
same old Joe, back again.

01:42:24.305 --> 01:42:30.748
