WEBVTT

00:08.833 --> 00:10.125
Cha-chung!

00:19.791 --> 00:23.333
Teca! Teca!
Protect Princess Maya!

00:23.416 --> 00:26.041
Teca! Destroy Divine Gate!

00:26.125 --> 00:30.166
Teca! Save Kingdom of Teca!

00:32.041 --> 00:34.333
Careful, careful, careful!

00:35.000 --> 00:37.875
Ay, gordo,
we need the other kingdoms.

00:37.958 --> 00:39.916
This could've been done
with more diplomacy.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.666
Diplomacy?

00:41.750 --> 00:44.625
You want Lord Mictlan to sacrifice Maya?

00:45.625 --> 00:47.666
-Hold her, Daggers.
-I got it, Shield.

00:47.750 --> 00:50.291
No, I'm Shield. I think.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.583
Should've told her the truth years ago.

00:53.666 --> 00:58.166
But if I'm not Shield,
whose hands are these?

01:02.875 --> 01:04.166
Ow. Ay!

01:04.250 --> 01:08.708
I don't think my arm is healed yet.
Thank you, helpful strangers!

01:08.791 --> 01:10.916
Any time, sister!

01:12.000 --> 01:16.041
-Why would you do such a foolish thing?
-I overheard everything.

01:17.125 --> 01:19.708
This… This isn't easy to discuss.

01:20.666 --> 01:22.625
Well, Papa could have said…

01:22.708 --> 01:25.791
"And by the way,
Maya, the gods do walk among us,

01:25.875 --> 01:27.958
and I cheated on your mother
with one of them,

01:28.041 --> 01:29.875
and then boom! You were born."

01:29.958 --> 01:31.208
Mija.

01:31.291 --> 01:35.958
Don't "mija" me. You could have told me
my birth mother is Lady Micte.

01:36.041 --> 01:39.208
When you were young,
it seemed too soon to tell you.

01:39.291 --> 01:43.916
And then… well, too much time had passed.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.833
How could you betray my-- your wife?

01:46.916 --> 01:48.083
Ooh.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.666
Weren't you angry, Mama?

01:49.750 --> 01:52.250
Oh, I was furious.

01:52.333 --> 01:54.458
It was the first time I stabbed him.

01:54.541 --> 01:57.166
I can still fit my finger
in the stabby hole.

01:59.375 --> 02:02.000
You were just a baby
when the forest spirits brought you.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.416
-Your father recognized your necklace

02:09.500 --> 02:11.625
-belonged to a death goddess.

02:11.708 --> 02:14.375
And right then and there, we knew.

02:17.125 --> 02:18.958
-You were their child.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.208
-But I couldn't be angry at you.

02:23.291 --> 02:24.875
This was not a choice you made.

02:25.666 --> 02:28.708
You were pure in an impure world.

02:28.791 --> 02:30.333
I am so sorry, Maya.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.416
And my birth mother, why…

02:33.000 --> 02:34.375
Why did she abandon me?

02:34.458 --> 02:36.958
-Why does she want to kill me now?

02:37.041 --> 02:40.458
Ay, mija, none of us can hope
to comprehend the gods.

02:41.041 --> 02:43.291
I hate her with all my heart.

02:43.375 --> 02:45.666
And you for lying about my mother.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.875
Maya! Listen to me, mija.

02:47.958 --> 02:51.875
You're a part of your father.
And you're a part of me.

02:52.375 --> 02:54.750
I may not have given birth to you,

02:54.833 --> 02:56.125
but I raised you.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.291
I am your mother.

03:02.208 --> 03:05.833
Wait, wait. So, if I'm half god,

03:06.583 --> 03:08.375
-am I invincible?

03:08.458 --> 03:09.625
-Ouch!
-No.

03:09.708 --> 03:11.791
-Okay, okay.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.708
I will make it up to you, Maya.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.416
-This I swear.

03:18.083 --> 03:24.958
-Teca! Teca! Teca!

03:25.625 --> 03:28.625
Could I just go
and see them destroy the Divine Gate?

03:28.708 --> 03:30.625
Just to watch. Please!

03:30.708 --> 03:32.125
Please?

03:32.208 --> 03:33.666
Oh.

03:33.750 --> 03:36.250
Mija, you're not a part of the prophecy.

03:36.333 --> 03:39.958
I need you to stay here
and help me protect the kingdom.

03:41.166 --> 03:44.375
-The Divine Gate will crumble before us!
-Teca!

03:44.458 --> 03:48.583
-We are the prophecy made flesh, mijos!
-We got this, Papa!

03:49.583 --> 03:51.375
-My eye!

03:52.000 --> 03:53.208
He doesn't got this.

03:53.291 --> 03:55.875
-You guys need to look out for him.
-We'll help him fight!

03:55.958 --> 03:57.458
We'll help him eat!

03:57.541 --> 03:59.375
We'll help him pee?

04:03.083 --> 04:05.583
-Your brother Lance…
-Your brother Daggers…

04:05.666 --> 04:07.125
And your brother Shield…

04:07.208 --> 04:10.583
-We swear an oath…
-…to destroy the Divine Gate.

04:10.666 --> 04:13.541
And prevent the gods
from entering the world.

04:13.625 --> 04:16.041
And ensure your safety, little sister.

04:17.041 --> 04:20.416
Oh, my jaguars.
You take care of each other, you hear me?

04:20.500 --> 04:21.958
-I love you all.
-Ugh.

04:22.041 --> 04:25.291
I'm so jealous you guys get to
go on this adventure, hermanos.

04:25.375 --> 04:28.291
-Prophecy or not--
-You are a great warrior, Maya.

04:28.375 --> 04:31.083
-We'll see you soon, hermana.
-Aw.

04:37.083 --> 04:38.166
Good boy, Chiapa.

04:40.083 --> 04:43.083
-Here you go, Papa.
-Gracias, mijo.

04:44.833 --> 04:46.541
If it is to be…

04:46.625 --> 04:47.958
It is up to me.

04:50.625 --> 04:54.333
-Teca! Teca! Teca!
-See you soon, Maya!

04:56.750 --> 04:59.125
Be safe, my loves!

04:59.208 --> 05:00.416
Oh!

05:00.500 --> 05:03.708
I have a battle jaguar.
What could be safer?

05:05.333 --> 05:10.291
We ride for glory. We ride for Maya!

05:11.291 --> 05:13.833
Ride, Mighty Eagle and Jaguars!

05:13.916 --> 05:17.083
Show the gods the might of the Tecas!

05:19.000 --> 05:23.708
Teca!
Teca! Teca! Teca! Teca!

05:29.708 --> 05:33.291
Teca… Teca… Teca…

05:50.625 --> 05:51.458
Huh?

05:54.958 --> 05:58.083
Warriors of Teca, prepare for battle.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.166
Lance ready.

05:59.250 --> 06:00.958
Shield ready, Papa.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.375
Daggers even readier.

06:04.458 --> 06:08.041
Did you know
that prophecies are just stories?

06:08.125 --> 06:10.500
Fables, you know, uh…

06:12.000 --> 06:16.083
They're there to make children believe
their parents are in control.

06:16.583 --> 06:20.916
Ah, such a pity that none of you
will make it to the Divine Gate.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.750
-Your journey ends here, mortals.

06:26.333 --> 06:31.750
You, little eagle man.
You must be the one they call King Teca.

06:31.833 --> 06:35.458
And you, monster,
you must be Lord Mictlan.

06:35.541 --> 06:36.750
Monster?

06:37.333 --> 06:40.333
I am the god of…

06:40.416 --> 06:42.583
-…war!

06:47.041 --> 06:49.625
It's too much!

06:50.833 --> 06:53.541
Teca! Teca!

06:53.625 --> 06:56.916
-We are the prophecy!

06:57.000 --> 06:58.375
And we shall end you!

06:58.458 --> 06:59.375
Ay!

06:59.458 --> 07:01.625
-For Maya!

07:01.708 --> 07:05.708
-For Maya!
-Teca!

07:22.583 --> 07:25.166
Oh, I can't wait for them to return, Mama!

07:25.250 --> 07:27.291
Ay, Maya.

07:27.375 --> 07:30.041
The journey
to the Divine Gate is long, mija.

07:30.125 --> 07:31.291
It'll take time.

07:31.375 --> 07:34.208
In the meantime,
we need to keep ourselves busy.

07:34.916 --> 07:35.875
Hmm.

07:35.958 --> 07:38.916
Right. Mama, I'm hungry.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.333
I will cook your favorite dish.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.708
Gracias, Mamá.

07:46.875 --> 07:49.083
Oh, this is such a cool scar!

07:49.166 --> 07:51.458
-I can't wait to show my brothers.

07:51.541 --> 07:54.666
-I mean, I could wait until they're back,

07:54.750 --> 07:57.083
but maybe I can meet them halfway.

08:11.833 --> 08:13.791
Hmm.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.708
Papa. Hermanos. It's me, Maya.

08:25.958 --> 08:26.791
Huh?

08:30.541 --> 08:31.375
Chiapa?

08:34.166 --> 08:35.833
What in the n--

08:37.583 --> 08:41.250
-Papa!
-Maya. Run, mija.

08:48.458 --> 08:51.000
You want him,
you'll have to go through me.

08:51.083 --> 08:54.958
Ah, courage runs
through your veins, Princess.

08:56.958 --> 08:58.458
Leave, now.

08:59.791 --> 09:02.291
I mean you no harm, King Teca.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.500
You're hurt.
A fight now will be dishonorable.

09:06.416 --> 09:08.291
-Your brothers' weapons…

09:08.375 --> 09:10.291
…they belong to your family now.

09:11.791 --> 09:13.916
-Honor them.
-Oh no.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.208
No.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.083
I am sorry for your loss.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.333
-Be well, Princess Maya.

09:23.666 --> 09:24.750
I'll see you soon.

09:27.291 --> 09:29.125
Papa, what happened?

09:29.208 --> 09:31.666
Your brothers, our mighty army,

09:32.458 --> 09:35.208
they are… no more.

09:35.291 --> 09:39.333
-You fought all the gods?
-It was-- It was just Lord Mictlan.

09:39.416 --> 09:42.166
-Maya, they are coming for you.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.541
I swear to you, Papa,

09:45.625 --> 09:48.500
-I will avenge my brothers.

10:33.625 --> 10:36.541
In this realm and the great beyond,

10:37.291 --> 10:40.791
you honor us
with your sacrifice, brothers.

11:34.125 --> 11:36.375
If it wasn't for the prophecy,

11:36.458 --> 11:39.375
I would have been there
to fight by your side.

11:46.833 --> 11:48.166
-Rooster?

11:50.041 --> 11:51.291
-Skull?

11:54.250 --> 11:55.750
-Puma?

11:55.833 --> 11:59.125
Rooster, skull, puma.

12:01.208 --> 12:02.666
Huh?

12:02.750 --> 12:05.333
I've seen those symbols together.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.750
Oh! Oh!

12:08.833 --> 12:10.375
-Gracias, hermanos.

12:10.458 --> 12:13.333
-Rooster, skull, pum--

12:13.416 --> 12:15.583
Rooster, skull, puma!

12:17.875 --> 12:20.041
Rooster, skull, puma!

12:21.333 --> 12:24.291
Rooster, skull, puma.

12:40.041 --> 12:42.500
Rooster, skull, puma, and Little Eagle

12:43.166 --> 12:45.583
fighting a two-headed serpent? What?

12:46.416 --> 12:49.916
Ugh, okay, okay. So, wait.
So, rotate the sun to get the--

12:50.000 --> 12:51.833
Wait, wait. The whole sun?

12:51.916 --> 12:54.291
This makes no sense, brothers.

12:55.291 --> 12:56.833
Unless…

12:56.916 --> 13:00.416
Okay. Okay, okay.
You rotate the whole sun…

13:00.500 --> 13:02.000
-Yes!

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Wait. Rooster?

13:06.083 --> 13:07.375
Rooster!

13:12.958 --> 13:14.166
Papa! Mama!

13:14.958 --> 13:16.583
Por favor, Maya.

13:16.666 --> 13:18.250
What is going on with you?

13:18.333 --> 13:20.875
Mis hermanos, they came to me in a vision.

13:20.958 --> 13:24.916
Like, with gold tears, and there was
a rooster, skull, and puma. They said--

13:25.000 --> 13:28.291
-What?
-Have you been here all night?

13:28.375 --> 13:30.583
Papa, please,
just spin the table to the left.

13:30.666 --> 13:32.333
Please. Just trust me.

13:32.416 --> 13:35.083
Maya, you sound loca, mija.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.333
See? It works!

13:38.416 --> 13:40.416
-Help me line up the rooster.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.000
Keep turning.

13:42.083 --> 13:44.083
-Stop. Stop.

13:47.625 --> 13:51.000
-Mama, help me line up the skulls.

13:55.708 --> 13:57.125
-A skull archer.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.333
And a puma warrior!

14:04.416 --> 14:06.541
Oh my gods.

14:07.083 --> 14:08.583
What does it all mean?

14:08.666 --> 14:12.291
We had the Teca prophecy wrong
all this time. That's why we lost.

14:12.375 --> 14:16.791
The real prophecy is that the rooster,
a skull, a puma, and a little eagle

14:16.875 --> 14:18.708
will team up to save the world!

14:18.791 --> 14:20.041
Huh.

14:20.125 --> 14:23.625
Where are we supposed to find
these legendary warriors?

14:25.125 --> 14:27.250
-I think we're about to find out.

14:29.541 --> 14:30.375
Come on!

14:33.125 --> 14:34.500
My brothers were right.

14:35.333 --> 14:40.291
So, if we follow the sunlight,
the Rooster Wizard will be in Luna Island,

14:40.375 --> 14:42.625
the Skull Archer in the Jungle Lands,

14:42.708 --> 14:45.916
and the Puma Warrior
in the Golden Mountains.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.791
And according to the ancient scrolls,
the Little Eagle shall lead them.

14:50.875 --> 14:53.250
-Little Eagle?
-You were--

14:53.333 --> 14:56.666
are both Eagle Warriors.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.125
-Wha--

14:58.208 --> 14:59.041
I'm…

15:00.375 --> 15:03.125
I'm the Eagle Warrior to lead them all!

15:09.708 --> 15:10.875
Hmm.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.916
Princess Maya is different, Father.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.625
You should have seen her,
courageous and-- and loyal.

15:19.125 --> 15:20.875
And beautiful.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.166
Be quiet, mijo. He will hear you.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.083
You want Lord Mictlan
to take your other eye?

15:27.583 --> 15:31.375
Do not get attached.
That would be very dangerous, my boy.

15:31.458 --> 15:32.333
Zatz!

15:34.458 --> 15:38.458
-Stand before me, Prince of Bats.
-Yes, my lord.

15:39.041 --> 15:43.166
This is the last time I will ask you.
Bring me the Teca princess. Bring her now!

15:43.250 --> 15:44.791
-Hmm?

15:45.416 --> 15:49.750
She will be yours,
and her sacrifice will be delicious.

15:51.166 --> 15:53.958
-Acat will bring her to you, my lord.
-Huh?

15:57.666 --> 16:01.125
Your wish is always my command,
Lord Mictlan.

16:01.708 --> 16:03.833
Very well, Acat.

16:03.916 --> 16:07.250
I trust you two
will bring her back in one piece.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.458
It will be our pleasure, my lord.

16:11.708 --> 16:14.041
Alive, please, Prince of Bats.

16:14.125 --> 16:17.916
She can only be sacrificed
if she's alive, girl.

16:18.708 --> 16:20.083
Of course, my lady.

16:20.166 --> 16:22.625
Cross my heart and hope to die.

16:28.625 --> 16:31.208
You're going to get yourself killed, Acat.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.291
You worry too much, Zatz.

16:34.291 --> 16:36.750
Sending children to fetch a child?

16:39.916 --> 16:43.166
Husband, you are incorrigible.

16:45.208 --> 16:47.750
-Okay, here's my plan.

16:47.833 --> 16:48.916
And it can't fail!

16:49.791 --> 16:52.916
First, I will ride Chiapa
to the Endless Forest.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.333
-Roar!

16:54.416 --> 16:57.416
I'll journey to Luna Island.
Gallop, gallop, gallop.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.875
Then I'll go, "Oh, hey, Gran Bruja."

16:59.958 --> 17:03.416
"You're the Great Rooster Wizard,
so will you join me on my quest?"

17:03.500 --> 17:04.750
"Let's do this, girl."

17:04.833 --> 17:08.250
She'll call a magic cloud or something
and I will fly to the Jungle Lands.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.375
And then I'll talk
to the little skull girl.

17:10.458 --> 17:13.750
"Hey, Widow Queen. I need to borrow
your greatest Skull Warrior."

17:13.833 --> 17:16.875
And she'll be like,
"Take this bad hombre. He's yours."

17:16.958 --> 17:21.166
And then we all jump back on the cloud
and fly to the Golden Mountains.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.625
Then the Barbarian Princess
will see my group of adventurers

17:24.708 --> 17:26.708
and will beg to join our quest.

17:26.791 --> 17:30.541
"Princess, I am the Great Puma Warrior.
Let me join your team."

17:30.625 --> 17:33.500
"You got it, Barbarian Princess!
Ride or die."

17:33.583 --> 17:36.791
The best part of it all
is there's no actual fighting.

17:36.875 --> 17:39.875
It's just a gathering
of three awesome warriors.

17:39.958 --> 17:44.125
And then I'll come back
to Teca totally safe.

17:44.208 --> 17:45.375
Booyah!

17:45.458 --> 17:48.208
By then, Papa will be healed
and ready to rumble.

17:48.291 --> 17:50.708
Mama, you get to be a warrior again.

17:50.791 --> 17:54.416
And with the three Great Warriors
by our side, we are off!

17:55.041 --> 17:57.291
Together, we will destroy the Divine Gate,

17:57.375 --> 18:00.166
-and we save the world!

18:00.666 --> 18:01.875
The end.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.958
I love this plan.

18:05.041 --> 18:06.625
But it can't be that easy.

18:06.708 --> 18:09.583
I know, I know.
Sacrifices will have to be made.

18:09.666 --> 18:13.125
And some, eh, might not make it back.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.166
Gran Bruja, probably.

18:18.750 --> 18:21.875
The Little Eagle finally
gets to go on her first adventure!

18:21.958 --> 18:23.750
And if you're not in Teca,

18:23.833 --> 18:26.958
hmm, it will be harder
for Lord Mictlan to find you.

18:27.041 --> 18:28.916
-That's right.
-All right, Maya.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.958
For this mission of diplomacy,
you must be properly dressed.

18:33.708 --> 18:35.416
Oh, no, no, no, no.

18:35.500 --> 18:40.750
Not another princess dress, please!
I could barely walk in that last one.

18:40.833 --> 18:42.333
Never thought

18:42.416 --> 18:45.333
-this would see the light of day again.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.250
-Wow.

18:49.958 --> 18:53.375
Your mama used to do
some damage with that thing.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.291
Yeah, I bet.

18:55.375 --> 19:01.083
It was a true honor for any warrior
to die by her beautiful hand.

19:01.666 --> 19:05.625
Ay, gordo,
you say the sweetest things.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.583
And now my Eagle armor is yours, Maya.

19:09.666 --> 19:10.666
Gracias, Mamá.

19:14.583 --> 19:16.125
Ew.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.750
-This was my first weapon.

19:22.458 --> 19:25.375
Ah. We fought the whole world together.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.041
Eagle Claw!

19:28.125 --> 19:30.750
Oh, yeah. To be young again.

19:30.833 --> 19:34.791
-Ooh!
-And now Eagle Claw is yours, Maya.

19:34.875 --> 19:37.458
I accept it in the name of the Tecas.

19:37.541 --> 19:39.666
And I will wield it with pride.

19:40.208 --> 19:42.208
Our little Eagle Warrior is ready.

19:44.041 --> 19:46.666
Chiapa has been
through all the realms.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.333
He'll guide you.
And you'll have the map we made for you.

19:49.416 --> 19:52.083
-Chiapa!

19:52.916 --> 19:55.000
Perhaps he isn't quite ready.

19:55.083 --> 19:57.125
-Chiapa, come out here!
-Easy, Papa.

19:58.125 --> 20:02.791
Come on, old friend.
We need you for one last mission.

20:06.000 --> 20:06.833
Chiapa?

20:07.833 --> 20:09.416
I need you, Chiapa.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.458
All we have to do
is bring back three warriors.

20:12.541 --> 20:14.083
-I promise.
-Mm-mm.

20:14.166 --> 20:17.250
-I can't do this without you.

20:30.041 --> 20:33.166
You have everything you need.
Follow the map.

20:33.750 --> 20:34.791
Thank you.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.041
Speak to no one, Maya.

20:37.125 --> 20:41.041
-And no matter what, no fighting.

20:44.250 --> 20:47.708
Take care of each other
and do not separate.

20:47.791 --> 20:50.583
May the celestials
illuminate your way, mija.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.625
We shall see you soon.

20:53.958 --> 20:56.416
-If it is to be…
-It is up to me.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.791
Fly, Little Eagle!

21:25.958 --> 21:28.666
I think we're getting close
to Luna Island, Chiapa.

21:46.291 --> 21:48.541
-No, no, no, no, no!

21:48.625 --> 21:50.125
No, no, no, no, no.

21:50.208 --> 21:52.041
And our supplies!

21:54.291 --> 21:55.916
-Huh?

21:56.000 --> 21:59.458
-Ah… No! What are we gonna do?

22:04.625 --> 22:06.375
That mocosa can't beat me.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.958
Even for you, Acat, this is low.

22:09.041 --> 22:11.375
Do you really need to weaken her
before you fight?

22:11.458 --> 22:17.375
No. It's just, sometimes a cat likes to
play with her food, my handsome prince.

22:17.458 --> 22:20.250
-This is not honorable.
-That hasn't bothered you before.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.125
Mm.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.666
No map, no supplies.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.666
I can't go back a failure.

22:33.833 --> 22:36.916
Was that your stomach or mine?
I can't even tell.

22:37.000 --> 22:37.875
-Hmm?

22:37.958 --> 22:39.791
-Huh?

22:43.208 --> 22:45.458
-Easy, boy.

22:57.041 --> 22:58.708
Run, Chiapa! Don't lose him.

23:08.541 --> 23:10.625
We need to eat.

23:13.791 --> 23:15.250
Mmm.

23:20.625 --> 23:21.625
Huh?

23:21.708 --> 23:23.375
Are you seeing this, Chiapa?

23:23.458 --> 23:27.416
Seriously. I need to know
if I'm hallucinating from hunger.

23:29.000 --> 23:29.958
Huh?

23:35.375 --> 23:36.208
Gracias.

23:37.791 --> 23:41.791
Perhaps an apple a day
will keep the healers away.

23:44.916 --> 23:48.291
Whoa, I've seen you before.
Wait. Whoa, what?

23:48.375 --> 23:52.250
What are you?
Are you-- Are you a forest spirit?

23:52.333 --> 23:55.291
A forest deer. Nothing to fear.

23:55.375 --> 23:57.333
Not the deer. Who are you?

23:57.416 --> 24:00.208
We are the spring and we are the fall.

24:00.291 --> 24:03.541
We are everything and nothing at all.

24:04.041 --> 24:06.458
-What?
-We are Ah Puch.

24:06.541 --> 24:08.708
Ah Puch. Ah Puch. Ah Puch.

24:08.791 --> 24:11.875
-Ah Puch.

24:12.750 --> 24:13.708
A what?

24:13.791 --> 24:20.583
Ah Puch is our name.
And this is all our game.

24:24.916 --> 24:28.250
-Ah, our dear Chiapa.

24:28.333 --> 24:30.458
Courageous like your papa.

24:31.250 --> 24:35.125
Anyway, Ah Puch,
can you guide us to Luna Island, please?

24:37.041 --> 24:38.208
Huh?

24:41.416 --> 24:45.833
Danger approaches, Little Eagle.
You must fulfill the true prophecy.

24:46.375 --> 24:53.250
Follow the clouds. Follow the clouds.
Follow the clouds. Follow the clouds.

24:53.333 --> 24:56.583
You know about the true prophecy?
Wait. Why didn't that rhyme?

24:56.666 --> 24:57.958
Follow what clouds?

24:58.041 --> 25:03.833
Oh, Princesa Maya,
come out to play-ee-ay!

25:03.916 --> 25:06.291
What? I know that laugh.

25:07.125 --> 25:07.958
Ah Puch!

25:08.041 --> 25:10.958
-Ah, great. Just great.

25:11.041 --> 25:14.958
Hey, whoever you are,
too chicken to fight me one-on-one?

25:19.041 --> 25:21.583
That stupid half-breed
did not just call me out!

25:21.666 --> 25:23.041
Remember our mission.

25:23.125 --> 25:27.666
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy punishing
that stuck-up princesa.

25:27.791 --> 25:29.375
Alive, Acat.

25:29.458 --> 25:32.791
-But of course, mi príncipe.

25:36.541 --> 25:38.041
What the…

25:39.958 --> 25:43.375
I am Acat, goddess of tattoos!

25:43.458 --> 25:46.208
Prepare to taste my ink!

25:47.000 --> 25:49.625
Me and my mighty beast
aren't afraid of you!

25:51.041 --> 25:52.458
Chiapa! Hold on!

25:57.791 --> 26:00.041
Wait. What?

26:00.666 --> 26:04.875
-I am Princess Maya, Teca Eagle Warrior!

26:04.958 --> 26:07.916
Prepare to taste my claw, caca face!

26:08.000 --> 26:10.625
Oh, I'm going to
have fun with you.

26:10.708 --> 26:13.958
Did you think some spoiled,
privileged princess

26:14.041 --> 26:17.958
-could take on a warrior goddess like me?

26:18.041 --> 26:21.666
-Yeah, I think I can take you.
-Oh, it's on.

26:42.583 --> 26:43.958
No one touches my hair.

26:44.041 --> 26:46.208
-I wasn't going for your hair.

26:51.250 --> 26:52.541
You can run, but you can't--

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
-I hate snakes.
-Well, how do you feel about trees?

27:01.083 --> 27:02.708
Trees?

27:13.708 --> 27:14.625
I like trees.

27:21.708 --> 27:25.833
That was amazing. If you weren't trying
to kill me, we could be best friends.

27:26.333 --> 27:28.416
What? Best friends?

27:33.416 --> 27:36.000
I don't need any friends.
I've never needed anyone.

27:38.833 --> 27:39.875
I have Zatz.

27:42.166 --> 27:43.958
-Oh, great.

27:45.833 --> 27:47.708
-Good night, princess.

27:59.750 --> 28:00.875
-Ah!

28:03.541 --> 28:04.541
-Ah!

28:16.875 --> 28:17.958
Girl time is over.

28:19.125 --> 28:22.500
I'm going to take your heart out
and give it to my boyfriend,

28:22.583 --> 28:24.375
and we'll be together forever.

28:24.458 --> 28:25.875
-Maya.
-Maya?

28:27.833 --> 28:30.125
She has got to go.

28:32.083 --> 28:33.416
Alive, Acat!

28:35.375 --> 28:39.416
Lord Mictlan needs her alive
for his sacrifice!

28:39.500 --> 28:40.333
Fine!

28:41.875 --> 28:43.750
I'll just rearrange her face.

28:48.208 --> 28:50.041
-You dropped this!

28:50.125 --> 28:51.125
Agh!

28:51.208 --> 28:54.333
You stabbed me with my own snake?

28:54.416 --> 28:56.875
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

29:00.125 --> 29:01.541
What in the name of…

29:01.625 --> 29:02.833
Silly half-breed.

29:02.916 --> 29:04.875
-Did you really think you--

29:10.208 --> 29:11.583
Bravo, Maya!

29:13.583 --> 29:15.125
Cállate, Zatz.

29:15.708 --> 29:19.291
-If it is to be, it is up to me!

29:25.083 --> 29:26.458
But not like this.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.500
Huh.

29:33.166 --> 29:34.291
Follow the clouds.

29:35.750 --> 29:36.875
Gracias, Ah Puch.

29:39.708 --> 29:44.041
Oh! Oh… Oh, thank the gods!
Except the ones who wanna kill me.

29:44.708 --> 29:45.541
Ugh.

29:48.500 --> 29:49.875
Luna Island.

29:53.916 --> 29:55.666
-Huh?

29:56.250 --> 29:58.541
-Oh, Princess Maya!

29:58.625 --> 30:02.250
-I'm not done with you, princesita!

30:02.333 --> 30:05.583
But I think I'm done with you.
Catch you later. Bye!

30:10.583 --> 30:13.250
-Come back here, you little mocosa!

30:27.583 --> 30:29.458
Too slow, ink face!

30:34.166 --> 30:35.458
I hate snakes!

30:43.958 --> 30:45.666
Eagle Claw!

30:46.250 --> 30:48.541
-No!

31:08.208 --> 31:09.291
Ha ha!

31:15.125 --> 31:17.291
Gracias, caca face!

31:18.666 --> 31:21.458
-I will end you!

31:28.750 --> 31:29.708
Whoa!

31:31.041 --> 31:32.750
Adios, princesita.

31:36.791 --> 31:37.791
What?

31:39.250 --> 31:40.333
Enough, Acat.

31:40.416 --> 31:41.500
But, Zatz, I--

31:41.583 --> 31:44.208
-First you disobey Lord Mictlan,

31:44.291 --> 31:47.291
and now you want to shoot
your opponent in the back.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.500
You have no honor, Acat.

31:56.625 --> 31:58.958
You and I were clearly a mistake.

32:01.458 --> 32:02.708
Ooh! Ouch.

32:03.291 --> 32:05.708
You'll be sorry for this, princesa.

32:07.750 --> 32:11.083
-Maya! Are you all right?

32:11.166 --> 32:15.208
I don't need help from a demon who serves
the god monster that killed my brothers!

32:15.291 --> 32:19.166
I'm no demon. I'm like you, a half human.

32:19.250 --> 32:22.125
-Huh?
-Please, Maya. Climb the rope.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.250
No!

32:26.000 --> 32:27.666
Good thing that was there, huh?

32:27.750 --> 32:29.708
"Good thing that was there, huh?"

32:30.291 --> 32:32.125
Oh, ha ha ha.

32:32.208 --> 32:38.041
Don't you dare think
that for one second I owe you anything,

32:38.125 --> 32:40.041
Prince of Bats.

32:40.125 --> 32:43.833
If anything, I should punch you in the…

32:43.916 --> 32:45.041
…face

32:45.125 --> 32:48.208
for everything that has happened
since you showed up,

32:48.291 --> 32:52.541
you misbegotten son of a leprous dog.

32:55.500 --> 32:58.333
Zatz, why would you help me?

32:58.916 --> 33:01.750
-Eagle Claw! Yes!

33:03.416 --> 33:05.208
Be well, Princess Maya.

33:06.333 --> 33:07.416
I'll see you soon.

33:08.041 --> 33:10.083
Whatever, principito.

33:14.458 --> 33:17.458
-Good luck, Maya.

33:25.958 --> 33:28.791
-I'm so sorry! Let me help you.

33:28.875 --> 33:29.708
Gracias.

33:30.208 --> 33:31.416
Gracias, niña linda.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.708
Oh, I'm so sorry.

33:36.791 --> 33:40.916
Uh, do you know where I can find
the Wizard Council, by any chance?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.083
Yeah.

33:43.166 --> 33:46.791
I'd tell you, but it's a secret
to the non-wizards and witches.

33:47.750 --> 33:50.875
-Huh? Oh, of course. I get it. I guess.

33:52.875 --> 33:53.958
Ta-da!

33:54.041 --> 33:57.250
-Welcome to the Luna Wizard Council.

33:57.833 --> 34:00.833
-What? You mean I was already here?

34:01.791 --> 34:04.791
Oh! You hustler!
I don't have time for this.

34:07.208 --> 34:10.458
So, I told him, "Not today, Gandolfo!"

34:14.833 --> 34:17.083
-Princesa Maya?

34:17.166 --> 34:19.583
The Teca prophecy was wrong.

34:20.791 --> 34:22.375
We are the prophecy.

34:22.458 --> 34:24.458
-And you, Gran Bruja,

34:24.541 --> 34:26.958
are the Great Rooster Wizard I seek.

34:28.208 --> 34:30.541
No, wait! I am!

34:30.625 --> 34:33.625
I am. I'm the Great Eagle Warrior.
