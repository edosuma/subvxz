SNOOP DOGG: This story right here
starts way back in '99

00:40.689 --> 00:44.109
when all Sid Derby cared about
was his friends and solar energy.

00:44.276 --> 00:47.737
- I burned a leaf.
- I fried an ant.

00:48.863 --> 00:50.656
I cooked a praying mantis.

00:51.323 --> 00:55.161
I used my passion for solar energy
to power this portable cell

00:55.286 --> 00:58.414
- and heat the neighbor's Jacuzzi.
- What?

00:59.415 --> 01:01.208
See what I'm talking about?

01:02.084 --> 01:03.753
I wasn't making this shit up.

01:04.545 --> 01:06.797
Thanks, kid.

01:08.132 --> 01:10.551
Sid's been through some ups and downs
since then

01:10.676 --> 01:12.219
and he's finna to go through some more.

01:12.386 --> 01:16.432
But, hell, every great journey's
got a little bit of turbulence.

01:16.599 --> 01:19.852
So buckle up and enjoy the ride, player.
And who knows?

01:20.019 --> 01:23.314
Maybe you and I will run into each other
again before it's all over.

01:24.732 --> 01:25.858
MAN: Good morning, ma'am.

01:26.067 --> 01:27.234
- My name is Sid Derby.
- No.

01:27.359 --> 01:28.486
And I'd like...

01:30.613 --> 01:33.824
Sir, are you familiar
with the merits of clean energy?

01:34.867 --> 01:36.368
Hmm. No.

01:37.620 --> 01:39.663
You can make a big difference
with solar energy.

01:39.789 --> 01:42.707
(STRONG ACCENT)
No, I don't speak English. Sorry.

01:44.042 --> 01:46.544
How'd you like to save
20% to 40% off your electricity bill?

01:47.754 --> 01:49.047
(AMERICAN ACCENT) I'm listening.

01:50.673 --> 01:53.551
- You know what excites me, Karen?
- Uh, winning?

01:53.635 --> 01:56.179
Winning. Precisely.
And do you know who's winning?

01:56.304 --> 01:58.014
Uh, we are?

01:58.139 --> 02:00.725
The planet. That's who's winning.

02:00.850 --> 02:05.146
See, at Palmetto, we're not just about
changing electric bills.

02:05.271 --> 02:08.733
I mean, we're about changing the world
and this is a great example.

02:08.858 --> 02:11.277
Right here,
the Harmony Vale Condominium Complex.

02:11.361 --> 02:15.156
This is gonna change the world, Karen.
Take a look at that solar potential.

02:15.281 --> 02:17.200
Hmm. Right here. Right here.
Right there.

02:17.325 --> 02:20.286
Come on. That's all day long.

02:20.412 --> 02:24.874
Oh. God bless America.
You know what we're gonna have to do?

02:25.041 --> 02:26.584
We need a top-notch salesperson.

02:26.710 --> 02:30.213
I want the most tenacious salesperson
we have on that video call.

02:31.089 --> 02:33.216
I can't tell you
what an honor this is, sir.

02:33.341 --> 02:36.885
I have been passionate about
clean energy ever since I was a kid.

02:37.052 --> 02:41.306
I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is that person
behind you having a seizure?

02:41.432 --> 02:42.516
What's that?

02:42.599 --> 02:44.184
- Oh, sorry.
- (CAMERA CLICKS)

02:44.309 --> 02:46.145
That's just my girlfriend, Sadie.

02:46.311 --> 02:48.605
She's... she's an Instagram model.

02:48.731 --> 02:53.235
Actually, Instagram model / social media
influencer / professional life-liver.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.697
You can follow me @Sadie_lady.

02:56.822 --> 03:01.326
Well, it's nice to meet you, Sadie.
Sid, focus up.

03:01.452 --> 03:03.454
This deal is very important to me.

03:03.537 --> 03:05.456
So here's what I'm gonna do.

03:05.831 --> 03:07.833
You close the Harmony Vale deal

03:07.958 --> 03:09.960
and I'm gonna send you
to Cabo San Lucas.

03:10.127 --> 03:11.795
All expenses paid. I don't care.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.882
Wow, sir. That, that is
incredibly generous of you but,

03:15.215 --> 03:18.052
if I'm being honest,
the real prize is your respect.

03:18.469 --> 03:22.139
Oh, huh? Huh? You're good.

03:22.222 --> 03:23.223
I won't let you down.

03:23.348 --> 03:26.602
We'll talk again soon.
And, Sid, remember,

03:26.727 --> 03:28.479
the planet is depending on us.

03:28.562 --> 03:30.189
Thank you, sir. Yes, sir.

03:30.980 --> 03:32.148
(SADIE CLEARS THROAT)

03:32.273 --> 03:36.319
- OK. I feel like that went pretty well.
- Yeah, he's definitely gonna follow me.

03:36.444 --> 03:37.820
(CAMERA CLICKS)

03:37.904 --> 03:41.324
Yeah.
Yeah, that... that's why it went well.

03:42.867 --> 03:44.535
I'm cleaning my butt with this tonight.

03:44.660 --> 03:46.329
Yeah, but smell this.

03:46.913 --> 03:50.333
- Baby, that smell like pickles.
- This is white tea and sage.

03:50.416 --> 03:52.794
Nah, those are pickles.
It smell like a dill pickle.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.629
No. You're ready to leave, aren't you?

03:55.129 --> 03:56.381
No. No. I'm having a good time.

03:56.506 --> 03:58.549
I'm having fun with my girl.
We smelling soaps.

03:58.633 --> 04:00.301
- Give me a kiss. I'm with you.
- You good?

04:00.426 --> 04:01.552
- I'm OK.
- Give me a kiss.

04:01.636 --> 04:02.804
- I'll give you one.
- Mwah.

04:02.887 --> 04:04.180
I'll come to you. (CHUCKLES)

04:04.305 --> 04:06.015
- You know what?
- What?

04:06.182 --> 04:08.976
Go find something to rub me down.
Hm-hmm.

04:09.102 --> 04:11.312
- Will I be rubbing you down?
- Oh, rub me down.

04:11.437 --> 04:14.273
Oh, baby.
Anybody know where the oils are at?

04:14.524 --> 04:17.860
I need to find some oils
that don't smell like pickles.

04:19.821 --> 04:21.613
(PHONE RINGS)

04:21.738 --> 04:23.741
Welcome to Juice Mobile.
How can I help you?

04:23.866 --> 04:26.660
So, like, I lost my phone.

04:27.869 --> 04:30.664
- And?
- And I don't know where it is.

04:30.747 --> 04:31.957
Hmm.

04:32.040 --> 04:36.670
It could be stuck between the couch seat
cushions, could be at the mall.

04:36.837 --> 04:40.173
- Could be at my friend Tommy's.
- OK, I got it. I got it.

04:41.216 --> 04:42.551
Just search your Find My Phone app

04:42.634 --> 04:45.429
and we'll figure out which one
of these riveting locations it's at.

04:45.554 --> 04:49.683
Yeah, but, huh, see, I don't have that.

04:49.766 --> 04:53.270
Always install the Find My Phone app.
You fucking bitch.

04:53.437 --> 04:54.604
(CLEARS THROAT)

04:55.939 --> 04:59.568
Look, you're never gonna find
your phone again.

05:00.193 --> 05:02.404
- You're 80% vape cloud.
- Like, forever?

05:02.529 --> 05:04.656
Yeah. Do you even remember
where you live?

05:07.075 --> 05:08.660
OK. Do you have your mom's credit card?

05:09.119 --> 05:10.412
- Yeah.
- Put it right here.

05:10.537 --> 05:13.457
Yeah. Will this help find it?

05:13.582 --> 05:16.877
I'm gonna set you up
with a brand-new phone, Kevin. OK?

05:16.960 --> 05:19.337
- I want my old one back.
- You're never gonna get it.

05:19.504 --> 05:21.797
Like you're probably not gonna
graduate high school.

05:22.381 --> 05:23.549
Hey, we should go by the park.

05:23.716 --> 05:26.469
I'm gonna get you an ice cream
to celebrate our big trip to Mexico.

05:27.011 --> 05:29.555
SID: It's not a done deal yet.
I still gotta close Harmony Vale.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.557
- You got it.
- It's gonna be tough.

05:31.807 --> 05:34.894
Oh, hello, good neighbors.
So crazy to see you here.

05:35.311 --> 05:36.687
Good to see you too.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.066
Oh, how unacceptably rude of me.

05:40.232 --> 05:43.778
Hello, Sasha and Ballard.
Very good friends. Siblings also.

05:43.903 --> 05:46.989
- Oh, cool.
- Fun. You're doing a show or...?

05:47.114 --> 05:50.618
A show? No, no,
we are getting coffee and a Danish.

05:50.701 --> 05:54.705
I mean, no Danish for me. I've not had
a carbohydrate since the '90s.

05:55.873 --> 05:57.708
(CLEARS THROAT) Keto.

05:57.833 --> 06:00.711
OK. Well, we gotta get Graham here
to the park

06:00.795 --> 06:03.714
or I'm gonna have to ask Ballard
to put a plastic bag over his head

06:03.798 --> 06:05.925
and pick up some dog shit
with his mouth.

06:08.844 --> 06:13.349
Ballard did not find this funny.
Nor did Sasha.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.352
- OK, well...
- I'm sorry.

06:17.435 --> 06:19.604
They're puppets,
so I'm not too worried about it.

06:19.729 --> 06:22.649
- All right, thank you very much.
- Yes, sir.

06:23.858 --> 06:24.984
- That's for you, hon.
- Yum.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.487
Oh!

06:28.655 --> 06:30.532
That's a good Graham.
Come, baby, get it.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.409
- Thanks.
- Look at it. I need my candids.

06:32.575 --> 06:35.036
- Take a picture.
- Oh, OK.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.329
Yum, yum, yum.

06:36.454 --> 06:39.416
I read that candids
get more interactions on Insta,

06:39.541 --> 06:40.709
so I need more candids.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.919
- Yeah, that's good.
- Is it cute?

06:43.044 --> 06:45.130
Yeah, there's a bunch
of really good ones in there.

06:45.296 --> 06:47.549
- Let me see.
- OK. It's not really a candid if...

06:47.632 --> 06:50.635
- Baby, I look really bad in all these.
- I think there are some...

06:50.719 --> 06:52.095
- I look like a chonk.
- No.

06:52.303 --> 06:55.181
We don't like chonk, OK?
We like young, slender.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.601
From below. Make me look leggy, OK?
So we need more ice cream.

06:58.727 --> 07:00.729
I don't think Graham
should have any more ice cream.

07:00.812 --> 07:04.733
- He's had a lot.
- Baby, this is, like, my career.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.776
- Sorry.
- We want that 10K.

07:06.943 --> 07:10.029
- So we get the swipe up.
- I know, honey. We need the 10K.

07:11.572 --> 07:14.658
Hey, can I get
just one more ice cream, please?

07:15.034 --> 07:16.952
Graham, look it, who's the best?

07:17.453 --> 07:19.329
- Influencer girlfriend, huh?
- Graham, look it.

07:19.496 --> 07:23.751
- Yeah.
- Yas, yas, yas, Graham.

07:23.834 --> 07:27.838
- You poor son of a bitch.
- Look at those bangs, Graham.

07:29.256 --> 07:31.800
- Uh-oh, her ice cream fell.
- (CHILDREN LAUGH)

could you make it two, actually?

07:35.137 --> 07:36.513
- Yeah.
- Thanks, bud.

07:36.597 --> 07:39.767
SADIE: We're breezy, yas.
You're a sweetie.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.769
All right. I'll get you in a sec.

07:41.852 --> 07:44.229
You're nice. Yes.

07:45.105 --> 07:47.566
Hey, there. Did you drop your ice cream?

07:48.233 --> 07:49.818
- Here, have a fresh one.
- Pedo!

07:49.902 --> 07:51.528
- He's a pedo!
- What?

07:51.653 --> 07:53.697
- Huh?
- Only pedos give kids free ice cream.

07:53.864 --> 07:56.158
- No, no, I'm not a pedo. I...
- Get back in your van, pedo.

07:56.283 --> 07:58.202
- Let's not call anybody a...
- Pedo!

07:58.369 --> 08:00.371
- Pedo! Pedo! Pedo!
- No, no, don't yell.

08:00.496 --> 08:02.581
- Pedo! Pedo!
- Stop doing that.

08:02.664 --> 08:05.292
- Pedo! Pedo! Pedo! Pedo!
- OK, just a sec. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:05.458 --> 08:06.626
We got to go. We got to go.

08:06.751 --> 08:10.213
OK. So that's level now.
Oh, come here.

- (SQUEALS)
- (CHUCKLES)

08:13.633 --> 08:16.094
Oh, that tickles!

08:18.763 --> 08:22.433
- What the actual fuck?
- Hey, baby, you're home early.

08:22.517 --> 08:25.395
And you're having sex with a strange
woman in the middle of our living room.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.897
What are you talking about?
I'm not having sex. I'm tickling her.

08:28.022 --> 08:30.233
Look, baby, this is Destiny. OK?

08:30.441 --> 08:32.818
Destiny, this is Charlotte,
my girlfriend I was telling you about.

08:32.902 --> 08:36.989
Destiny is a dancer I hired to test
the strength of this amazing sex swing

08:37.073 --> 08:38.573
I got for us to celebrate Arbor Day.

08:38.741 --> 08:40.952
He just wanted to make sure
there wouldn't be any chafing.

08:41.077 --> 08:42.453
(SQUEAKS)

08:42.578 --> 08:45.331
This is the last straw.

08:46.916 --> 08:49.585
No, it ain't.
We got several more straws left.

08:49.669 --> 08:53.589
- I don't know why you bought straws.
- Frederick Grouper Jones III,

08:53.715 --> 08:56.884
you are a child
and I am tired of being your babysitter.

08:57.009 --> 08:58.928
- OK. Let me get this straight.
- Uh-huh.

08:59.011 --> 09:02.431
You're mad at me
for taking safety precautions?

09:02.556 --> 09:03.765
- And?
- I did this for us.

09:03.890 --> 09:06.727
That's your problem. You never have
an open mind. All you do is overreact.

09:06.893 --> 09:08.437
- Overreact?
- And jump to conclusions.

09:08.562 --> 09:11.440
You have a stripper suspended
from the ceiling and I'm overreacting?

09:11.523 --> 09:12.816
Guys, I...

09:13.483 --> 09:15.444
I think I'm just gonna go.

09:17.279 --> 09:21.575

No one has this kind of time.

Well, happy Arbor Day to you too.

09:31.043 --> 09:33.170
CHARLOTTE: The movers
will be coming for my furniture.

09:34.004 --> 09:37.841
They're not gonna take the sex swing.
The sex swing stays!

09:37.924 --> 09:41.011
Babe, I told you
we shouldn't give Graham ice cream.

09:41.136 --> 09:42.345
Sorry, babe.

09:42.512 --> 09:46.767
Hey, will you pick out a photo of heart
hands around the sun for me, please?

09:46.892 --> 09:49.603
Oh, babe, you know I like
when you do the pro-solar stuff.

09:49.728 --> 09:50.687
I'm on it.

09:50.812 --> 09:54.024
Like they say, the couple
that solars together stays together.

09:54.149 --> 09:56.692
They do say that.
They do... they do say that about...

09:56.859 --> 09:58.986
- (PHONE RINGS)
- ...solaring together. Oh.

10:02.948 --> 10:04.200
Hey, Jonesie, what's up, man?

10:04.950 --> 10:08.704
Look, Charlotte broke up with me
and it's over a stupid misunderstanding.

10:08.829 --> 10:11.957
Oh, shit, dude. I'm so sorry.
Oh, that's awful.

10:12.083 --> 10:15.836
I don't know what I would do
if Sadie left me. You OK?

10:16.128 --> 10:18.589
Ew, but not morning heart hands.
Bleurgh!

10:18.756 --> 10:21.634
No morning? OK. OK, no morning.

10:21.759 --> 10:25.304
What's that? Oh, uh, right now?

10:25.429 --> 10:27.973
You know, I just told Sadie
I would help her with this photo.

10:28.140 --> 10:30.309
Is it cool if I just check in
with you later? Yeah?

10:30.434 --> 10:32.311
Oh, and I don't want
evening heart hands.

10:32.436 --> 10:35.231
- We did that two weeks ago.
- No evening. Got it.

10:35.356 --> 10:38.317
OK, man. Hang in there. I'm here
for you. All right? Gotta go. Bye.

10:39.235 --> 10:40.820
OK.

10:40.945 --> 10:43.781
Twilight heart hands.

10:46.033 --> 10:48.119
What the... fuck?

10:48.536 --> 10:50.704
Puppet show? Puppet?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.002
What the fuck?
What the fuck? What the fuck?

10:58.128 --> 11:00.338
Sadie!

11:00.547 --> 11:04.759
What? If Graham shit again,
we have to give him pumpkin

11:04.884 --> 11:08.430
and, like, boiled chicken
and then some rice or something. Oh.

11:10.682 --> 11:14.102
You're cheating on me with
the weird puppet guy from next door?

11:14.227 --> 11:20.191
Umm. Like, I don't think it's cool
that you went through my phone, so...

11:21.443 --> 11:23.862
- How long has this been going on?
- Not that long.

11:23.945 --> 11:25.363
Just, like, nine months.

11:25.572 --> 11:27.657
- Huh?
- But it's more of an emotional affair.

11:27.782 --> 11:31.578
- Except for the sex.
- Yeah, that's very sweaty and physical.

11:31.745 --> 11:33.079
(GASPS)

(BANGING ON WALL)

11:36.416 --> 11:38.293
Shush, Clos.

11:39.753 --> 11:41.004
He...

11:42.297 --> 11:44.924
- Yeah.
- You piece of shit! Shut up!

11:45.050 --> 11:46.091
- Oh.
- You son of...

11:46.216 --> 11:49.053
I mean, that's a very soft pillow.
He wouldn't hear that.

11:49.178 --> 11:51.055
(SNORTS)

11:52.056 --> 11:58.979
Um, this is, like, really bad timing,
but these were really expensive to rent.

11:59.104 --> 12:02.691
So do you think you could take
my sweet baby angel picture?

12:02.816 --> 12:05.194
That would be super great.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.907
- (CAMERA CLICKS)
- I'm sorry. Is this way better?

12:11.617 --> 12:15.120
I'm sorry. Did you get it?

12:15.371 --> 12:17.456
Yeah, I think it looks really fine.
You wanna check it?

12:17.664 --> 12:19.708
(GASPS) Cute!

12:22.127 --> 12:26.715
I think that's the last of it.
Hey, take care.

12:26.840 --> 12:30.260
And if you need anything at all,
I'll be right next door.

12:30.386 --> 12:32.137
Yes, no dense feelings, Sidney.

12:32.304 --> 12:34.932
I would love to remain
good neighbor friends with you.

12:37.434 --> 12:39.520
- Bye.
- Come, baby.

12:39.686 --> 12:42.939
- Danke schÃ¶n, baby.
- NatÃ¼rlich. Hmm.

12:43.064 --> 12:45.775
Yeah, hmm. Please, after you.

12:45.900 --> 12:48.069
- Would you like to ride on my autobahn?
- SADIE: Yes.

12:48.152 --> 12:49.987
- CLOS: Perfect.
- SADIE: What's the speed limit?

12:50.113 --> 12:53.950
CLOS: Oh, it's as high as you like.
And my airbags are super firm.

OK.

13:10.216 --> 13:11.300
What?

13:14.137 --> 13:15.513
Everything all right in here?

13:15.680 --> 13:18.099
- I heard a woman crying.
- What are you talking about?

13:18.182 --> 13:21.102
I'm talking a really shrill,
girly kind of cry. Like...

13:21.227 --> 13:23.813
(IMITATES CRYING)

13:24.439 --> 13:26.441
Yeah, yeah,
I think I might have heard that too.

13:26.566 --> 13:31.696
But it's probably those migrating owls
I was reading about.

13:31.821 --> 13:33.197
Yeah, anyway, here's your mail.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.370
Oh. Mmm. (SNIFFLES)

13:40.495 --> 13:43.248
What do you know?
The owls are migrating again.

(TOOLS WHIR)

13:54.885 --> 13:55.886
May I help you?

13:56.011 --> 13:59.306
Could you please put the porta-potties
over by the shrubbery?

14:00.390 --> 14:01.683
Sorry, I can't do that.

14:02.184 --> 14:04.352
You can't put the porta-potties
by the shrubbery?

14:05.062 --> 14:07.814
No, I can't have you
call them porta-potties.

14:07.939 --> 14:11.777
OK, these are patented
Jones Family Traveling Toilets.

14:12.736 --> 14:17.199
OK. Would you please put
the Jones Family...

have someplace to take a crap?

14:26.833 --> 14:29.961
- Yes, I will gladly do that.
- Thank you.

14:34.715 --> 14:36.801
I was so pissed
when I heard about your breakup.

14:36.926 --> 14:39.428
- How are you holding up?
- I'm not great but Sid is a lot worse.

14:39.553 --> 14:43.057
- We need to pull a rescue mission.
- That bad? What are you thinking?

14:43.182 --> 14:47.311
Let me conference in Runway Dave.
Maybe we can come up with a game plan.

14:48.437 --> 14:49.438
Jello?

14:49.563 --> 14:53.025
Yo, Runway Dave, what's up, man?
It's... It's Jonesie and Angry Mike.

14:53.484 --> 14:56.821
Gee, been a while.
To what do I owe you the honor, bitches?

14:56.946 --> 14:59.782
Now, look here, we got a code three
rescue situation on our hands.

14:59.907 --> 15:02.243
Sid's taking this breakup with Sadie
like a real pussy.

15:02.827 --> 15:05.663
I'm glad to see you haven't lost
your way with words, Angry Mike.

15:05.830 --> 15:07.957
- Should we conference him in?
- So when I bring him in,

15:08.082 --> 15:09.875
just make sure you're upbeat, OK?

15:18.509 --> 15:21.137
Oh, shit. This is a rescue mission.

15:21.262 --> 15:23.723
Look, as your friends,
we wanna make you feel better.

15:23.848 --> 15:25.349
So we wanna take you out tonight

15:25.474 --> 15:27.892
and make you do a bunch of tequila shots
until you throw up.

15:27.976 --> 15:30.103
Yeah, and then maybe draw dicks
on your face.

15:30.228 --> 15:34.482
Yeah, that sounds awesome,
but I think I'm gonna hang in for now.

15:34.607 --> 15:37.944
Look here, Sid, don't make us
go commando style with this mission, OK?

15:38.069 --> 15:40.780
You know I'm quick to go grab
that chloroform and zip ties. Yup.

15:41.406 --> 15:44.075
(GROANS) OK, fine.

please no talking about solar power.

OK, what is your problem, man?
You're always late.

16:05.346 --> 16:08.558
- It's your skincare regimen, isn't it?
- That's classified information.

16:08.683 --> 16:12.145
I am so happy
that the boys are back together again.

16:12.312 --> 16:15.357

is back out hitting these streets.

16:18.735 --> 16:20.861
Hey, man. Don't worry about Sadie, OK?

16:20.986 --> 16:23.030
- She was a fucking skank.
- Come on, Mike.

16:23.155 --> 16:25.074
- Dude.
- What?

16:25.199 --> 16:27.576
Now, I know
it's not under the best circumstances,

16:27.701 --> 16:30.037
but it's really good
to see you guys again.

16:30.162 --> 16:32.331
Y'all really are my best friends, man.

to come together.

that you have no interest in.

- Get them to like us.
- OK.

17:00.025 --> 17:03.237
- Got us?
- Hold my purse. (CHUCKLES)

Come on, man. We back. Oh, yeah. Ladies.

17:13.579 --> 17:14.998
I'd have never got caught by the cops

17:15.124 --> 17:17.625
if that octopus from the aquarium
touch pool wasn't still on my back.

- Yeah, man.

17:26.759 --> 17:28.553
So what do you do, Sid?

17:28.678 --> 17:31.848
Oh... (CLEARS THROAT)
I work in solar energy.

17:31.973 --> 17:36.811

over 175 petawatts of energy

17:36.978 --> 17:38.104
in the upper atmosphere,

17:38.229 --> 17:43.151
which is enough to power Las Vegas
for the next thousand years, so...

17:47.363 --> 17:50.033
- OK. We're gonna go to the bathroom.
- Yeah.

17:52.035 --> 17:54.746
Just pour the fucking drink
in the glass.

17:55.872 --> 17:57.582
None of that shit makes it taste better.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.169
- Hey.
- You all right, bro?

18:01.294 --> 18:03.504
No, I feel pretty bad.
I think I'm gonna head home.

18:03.629 --> 18:07.050
OK. Just text me if anyone tries
messing with you on the way out.

18:07.175 --> 18:08.426
I'll punch them in the face.

18:09.135 --> 18:11.011
I don't think
that'll probably be necessary.

18:11.178 --> 18:15.557
Yeah. I'll keep an eye out.
There's a lot of fucknuts in here.

- You like the man meat, yeah?
- No, I don't.

18:49.508 --> 18:52.803
I mean, that I'm cool with that.
My friend likes the man meat.

18:52.928 --> 18:55.597
No, I'm more of a lady-meat guy.

18:55.722 --> 18:57.557

You're young.

18:57.682 --> 18:59.559

it's complicated, yeah?

you think we could just, like, go?

We're not gonna do that here cos, um...

20:52.128 --> 20:56.882
this place reeks of sadness
and... and musty balls.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.886
- All right.
- Come on. Let's get out of here.

- No, I'm good.

(GROANS)

21:30.708 --> 21:33.627
OK. Now let me tell you
what I was thinking.

21:33.711 --> 21:37.005
All right, since your girlfriend
left you and my girlfriend left me,

21:37.172 --> 21:38.674
that only means one thing.

21:38.799 --> 21:40.843
We're utterly alone
and deeply despondent?

21:40.968 --> 21:44.096
That means we got two apartments
and we only need one.

21:44.888 --> 21:47.725
That's right.
I'm saying we should move in together.

21:47.850 --> 21:50.310
Me and you.
Do this breakup thing together.

21:51.227 --> 21:55.732
- You wanna be roommates?
- Hell, no. Roommates are creepy. No.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.610
I want us to be bromates, huh?

21:59.694 --> 22:02.822
Because we already bros
and just add the mates.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.241
- Bromates.
- Bromates.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.493
- I don't know, man.
- What are you talking about?

22:07.618 --> 22:08.619
It'd be amazing. Look.

22:08.703 --> 22:13.416
We'll play video games all day.
We'll drink unlimited beer. (LAUGHS)

22:13.499 --> 22:15.293
And we'll make chocolate chip pancakes.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.212
I do like brunch but... I don't know.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.716
I'm not sure pancakes are the solution
to my relationship problems.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.926
Dude, we've been best friends
since we're six years old.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.261
We always had each other's back.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.513
My job is to help you get over Sadie.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.141
You can help me get over Charlotte,
though to be honest with you,

22:30.266 --> 22:31.976
you would be the one
that needs most of the help.

22:32.101 --> 22:35.396
I'm good. I'm in a plastic bubble bath
drinking beer.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.898
And I got a mushroom pizza on the way.

22:37.398 --> 22:40.610
Excuse me, there's no alcohol
allowed in the ball pit,

22:40.693 --> 22:42.695
and you have to be
under eight years of age.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.118
- Sir, I still see you.
- No, you can't.

22:50.577 --> 22:51.745
Yes, I can.

22:52.704 --> 22:55.457
- Sorry.
- Pedo, pedo, pedo, pedo.

22:55.582 --> 22:56.792
You got to be kidding me.

22:56.917 --> 22:59.002
Mom, Mom, that's him,
that's the guy from the park.

22:59.127 --> 23:00.462
What the...?

23:03.298 --> 23:04.841
(CHUCKLES)

23:04.966 --> 23:06.676
This is amazing.

23:06.760 --> 23:10.263
I cannot believe this naked troll pencil
only cost 600 tickets.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.474
Yeah, and it only took
four and a half hours to get it.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.936
Anyway, I think this bromates situation
is gonna be great for both of us.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.439
Unless you're happy
living where you already are.

23:20.774 --> 23:21.983
SADIE: Pound my schnitzel!

23:22.109 --> 23:25.445
- (LOUD THUDDING)
- Ooh, yes. Hashtag yes.

23:25.987 --> 23:26.905
OK, I'm in.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.657
- (KNOCKING AT DOOR)
- Jonesie.

23:29.449 --> 23:32.786
- Hey, welcome, bromate.
- Hey, hey.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.538
- Come right in.
- All right. Here we go.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.957
Make yourself comfortable, man.
Welcome to your new home.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.959
- Thank you. Look at this.
- Yes.

23:42.002 --> 23:44.922
Wow, it's really open concept.

23:45.047 --> 23:47.174
Yeah, this place is a lot bigger
ever since Charlotte

23:47.341 --> 23:49.969
took all her decorative bullshit
out of here. (LAUGHS)

23:50.094 --> 23:51.512
You mean furniture?

23:51.595 --> 23:52.722
(BARKS)

23:53.514 --> 23:56.517
- Is that a sex swing?
- You're damn right it's a sex swing.

23:56.642 --> 24:01.147
Yeah, I got
the best sex swing money can buy.

24:01.313 --> 24:03.107
I spent all my income tax money on that.

24:03.274 --> 24:06.777
Love it. (CHUCKLES)
But look, don't worry about it, OK?

24:06.861 --> 24:08.988
I ain't gonna do anything
while you're in the bed.

24:09.113 --> 24:11.323
At least not while you're awake.
(LAUGHS)

24:11.407 --> 24:12.700
(NERVOUS LAUGHTER)

24:13.159 --> 24:16.746
(SNORES) Uh, yeah. (LAUGHS)

24:16.829 --> 24:18.372
Ah, make yourself comfortable.

24:18.789 --> 24:22.460
Hey, did you happen
to bring your crock-pot, by any chance?

24:22.585 --> 24:24.962
It'll be nice to make stews
when the winter months approach.

24:25.421 --> 24:28.215
You know I'm not, like, planning
to stay that long, right?

24:28.382 --> 24:30.509
No, man, the healing process takes time.

24:30.676 --> 24:33.095
You're gonna be here as long
as you need to be here, brother.

24:33.220 --> 24:34.805
We're gonna get you healed.

24:34.889 --> 24:37.807
You know what else does the healing?
My stews, man.

24:37.932 --> 24:40.518
That's what everybody say,
my stews make you fall in love.

24:40.643 --> 24:44.773
Wow, this is amazing, man.
Your collection is off the chain.

24:44.856 --> 24:48.735
To be honest with you, with both boxes
blended together, that's gonna be dope.

24:50.028 --> 24:53.156
Hey, Jonesie, are you a liquid soap guy
or a bar soap guy?

24:53.698 --> 24:55.408
Yeah, I like to use the bar soap

24:55.533 --> 24:58.370
directly on my balls
and in my butt crack,

24:58.495 --> 24:59.579
so it's your choice.

25:01.623 --> 25:03.375
I'm gonna go with the liquid.

25:06.878 --> 25:09.047
I've been working
on our bromates handshake.

25:09.214 --> 25:14.469
Check this out. One, two, high five,
dap, one finger, blow it up.

25:14.594 --> 25:16.054
Let's do a dance. The tootsie roll.

25:16.179 --> 25:18.348
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, what is that?

25:18.473 --> 25:20.975
- What?
- Nah, you got to take that down.

25:21.101 --> 25:23.687
Oh, come on. I can't just get rid
of all of our stuff.

25:23.853 --> 25:27.440
We were together for two years,
seven months and three days.

25:27.524 --> 25:28.525
That's a lot of my life.

25:29.067 --> 25:30.609
I don't care how long was you together.

25:30.734 --> 25:33.696
That doesn't belong here.
We're not putting up photos of our ex.

25:33.821 --> 25:36.115
Do you see Charlotte up there?
I don't think so, brother.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.492
Look here, Sid, I know you miss Sadie.

25:38.617 --> 25:40.994
I miss Charlotte, too.
Charlotte was a wonderful woman.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.830
But she wanted two things
I couldn't give her.

25:42.913 --> 25:44.123
Oh, love and devotion?

25:44.206 --> 25:46.750
Hell, no. She wanted me
to grow up and get my shit together.

25:46.875 --> 25:47.960
And I refuse to do that.

25:48.085 --> 25:49.420
You are my bromate, brother.

25:49.545 --> 25:52.589
And I have an obligation
to stop you from doing crazy shit.

25:52.715 --> 25:55.676
And you putting that picture up
is fucking crazy. OK?

25:55.801 --> 25:58.303
So take the picture down or else.

25:58.846 --> 26:00.055
Oh, or else what?

26:00.597 --> 26:01.890
Or else...

26:05.269 --> 26:06.729
Oh, or else this.

26:09.398 --> 26:12.526
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Well, don't do that.

26:12.651 --> 26:14.403
- That's what you want?
- No, don't do that.

26:14.528 --> 26:16.030
- I'll do it.
- That's way crazier.

26:16.155 --> 26:17.948
- No, it's not, it's the same crazy.
- Fine.

26:18.824 --> 26:20.159
You win. You're crazier.

26:20.617 --> 26:21.660
Whoo!

26:22.036 --> 26:23.912
Man, that was intense.

26:24.038 --> 26:26.164
I did not feel like
getting electrocuted today.

26:26.998 --> 26:28.875
Why would you electrocute yourself
any day?

26:28.958 --> 26:33.421
I smell like brown sugar when I get
electrocuted, but... it ain't worth it.

26:35.214 --> 26:36.966
MAN: Welcome to the big time, Sid.

26:37.091 --> 26:40.178
I've got a lot of other pitches to hear.
So what have you got to say?

26:40.678 --> 26:42.638
It's not what I have to say, sir.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.225
It's what I have to show.

26:47.018 --> 26:49.562
So, according to my calculations,

26:49.687 --> 26:51.647
Palmetto's Clean Energy Technology

26:51.773 --> 26:54.650
would reduce
Harmony Vale's carbon emissions by 80%

26:54.776 --> 27:00.156
while saving its residents
a whopping $6.23 million a year.

27:00.239 --> 27:01.824
And you can guarantee these figures?

27:02.241 --> 27:04.285
Well, sir, after catching my girlfriend

27:04.410 --> 27:06.329
cheating on me
with a Bavarian puppeteer,

27:06.496 --> 27:09.040
these figures are about the only thing
in life I can guarantee.

27:10.041 --> 27:12.335
My wife cheated on me
with a Greek ventriloquist!

27:12.752 --> 27:15.088
That's easy, man.
Solving problems is what I do.

27:15.213 --> 27:17.715
No, I love it more. (LAUGHS)

27:17.840 --> 27:19.175
- Good news.
- Go.

27:19.300 --> 27:22.010
Sid Derby got
Harmony Vale Condominium Complex

27:22.135 --> 27:24.012
to agree to sign papers next week.

27:24.930 --> 27:26.765
Oh, my God, my pulse is going up.
How did he do that?

27:26.932 --> 27:29.184
They seem to have bonded
over the loves of their life

27:29.309 --> 27:32.104
cheating on them
with European puppeteers, sir.

27:32.562 --> 27:35.691
That's weird. Really weird.
Sock, stick, marionette?

27:35.774 --> 27:38.694
- What are we talking about here?
- Rod and arm, sir.

27:38.819 --> 27:41.571
- (WHISTLES) Hey, could be worse, right?
- Yeah.

27:41.697 --> 27:43.365
Give me a minute.
I'm maxing out right now.

27:43.573 --> 27:46.660
- OK.
- Ha! Ha!

27:48.161 --> 27:52.165
OK. There we have it. (LAUGHS)
We are officially up and running

27:52.290 --> 27:57.337
on Tinder, Christian Mingle,
and nearsightedbigbootywomen.com.

27:57.462 --> 27:58.547
(LAUGHS)

27:58.630 --> 28:00.882
Wait, wait, we?
I didn't sign up for any dating apps.

28:01.007 --> 28:03.844
I know you ain't. I signed you up
because I knew you wouldn't do it.

28:03.969 --> 28:06.555
Just remember
that you speak six languages

28:06.680 --> 28:08.181
and you're a certified ornithologist.

28:08.306 --> 28:09.349
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

28:09.516 --> 28:12.227
Wait a minute. I think that's Charlotte.

28:12.894 --> 28:14.104
OK, answer the door.

28:14.229 --> 28:16.522
I don't wanna look thirsty
or like I'm too desperate.

28:16.647 --> 28:17.940
I'm gonna sit over here.

28:18.441 --> 28:19.942
Get my pose together.

28:23.404 --> 28:26.073
- Open the door.
- Sure that's what you wanna go with?

28:27.033 --> 28:29.577
Oh, yeah, she's not gonna be
able to resist that.

28:31.996 --> 28:34.999
- Hey.
- Sadie, hey.

28:35.082 --> 28:37.668
I called your mom.
She said you were staying here.

28:37.835 --> 28:42.089
- Are you sleeping on the floor?
- What? Oh, barely.

28:42.214 --> 28:44.842
I mean, we're out partying a lot.

28:44.967 --> 28:46.969
So it's not getting a ton of use,
you know,

28:47.053 --> 28:51.349
probably like five hours a night max.
Less, honestly. Four.

28:51.474 --> 28:56.395
Four and a half maybe average,
mean, mode, definitely median.

28:56.604 --> 28:59.148
You know, there's our...
there's our sex swing.

28:59.732 --> 29:00.858
We don't use it together.

29:00.983 --> 29:02.985
We don't really use it.
What's up with you?

29:03.110 --> 29:05.738
Um, I'm here because I'm missing things.

29:05.905 --> 29:07.281
Oh, my God. Me too, babe.

29:07.406 --> 29:09.200
I just... I, like, I miss our talks.

29:09.325 --> 29:13.370
And I miss the sound of your laugh
and I miss how you brush your teeth

29:13.495 --> 29:15.080
and how you order for me
at restaurants.

29:15.205 --> 29:17.749
Oh! (LAUGHS)
No, no, no, I meant some stuff.

29:17.874 --> 29:23.463
Um, like, Whitney Houston records.
I think I left, like, a shoe.

29:24.089 --> 29:27.092
- I'll go get your stuff.
- Thank you.

29:30.136 --> 29:34.849
No, no, no, OK. I can't take it no more.
Give me this. No, OK?

29:34.974 --> 29:37.102
If we can't have
"I Wanna Dance with Somebody"...

29:37.227 --> 29:39.062
- Oh, no, no, no.
- ...nobody will!

No. No!

29:40.814 --> 29:45.068
Oh, my Houston.

- Don't you tap dance on Whitney.
- I'm tapping it.

Don't you dance on my...
That's my favorite record!

she just came by for her stuff.

30:25.983 --> 30:28.152
Look, she just wanna show off
her six-pack abs

30:28.277 --> 30:30.612
and her surprisingly perky breasts. Hmm!

30:31.447 --> 30:33.991
Thank you so much, Jonesie.
Super helpful.

Look, Sid, we're bromates, OK?
And I respect the hell out of you.

30:38.912 --> 30:40.789
But you're going about this thing
all wrong.

Hey, you're the breakup expert.
Fill me in.

30:43.751 --> 30:45.919
Here we go. The best way
to get through a breakup

30:46.086 --> 30:49.423
is not sitting around obsessing
about what's missing in your life.

30:49.548 --> 30:54.470
No. You got to push all that down
and pump in new, fun stuff, you know?

30:54.595 --> 30:56.430
I think you're talking about repression.

30:56.555 --> 30:57.765
OK. You still don't get it.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.434
Remember we had the fuzzy pump-up
barbershop when we were kids?

31:00.600 --> 31:02.977
- The Play-Doh thing?
- The Play-Doh thing, yes.

31:03.102 --> 31:06.522
If you put enough new Play-Doh on top,
eventually it will pump out

31:06.689 --> 31:12.111
all the nasty, crusty, disgusting,
negative Play-Doh to the ground,

31:12.236 --> 31:14.238
and maybe the dog'll eat it
or somebody'll kick it.

31:14.364 --> 31:16.282
I don't know. But you understand
what I'm saying?

31:16.407 --> 31:18.493
- Not even a little bit, no.

You are a Hopi Brave, OK?

31:28.252 --> 31:33.091
And what you need to do as
a Hopi Brave is defer to your elders,

when it comes to matters of the heart

older than you, right?

Yeah. Similarly, I, I just... um...

33:11.562 --> 33:15.566
I kind of always thought my girlfriend
Sadie and I would be together forever

33:15.649 --> 33:19.111
and... it's just not how it worked out.

33:20.029 --> 33:21.405
What did she die from, son?

33:21.530 --> 33:24.283
Hmm? Oh, no. She's still alive.

33:24.784 --> 33:29.372
Kind of makes it harder.
She left me for a puppeteer.

- Hi.
- Hmm.

34:14.541 --> 34:18.168
That's actually how I met my wife,
Virginia.

34:26.386 --> 34:28.096

We're gonna go down to the bar,

we're gonna have some drinks
and do some sexual healing.

- See you.

Getting to talk about Abner with people

34:43.985 --> 34:45.362
was so helpful. Thank you.

Oh, it was my pleasure.

34:47.197 --> 34:50.409

such a wonderful, special man.

He was. And don't you worry.

for it to stay broken for long.

- See you next time.

see a movie or something?

43:29.919 --> 43:32.172
Do something before
you get hit with a restraining order.

43:33.173 --> 43:34.215
What the hell am I gonna say?

43:34.341 --> 43:36.593
- She's probably not into solar energy.
- Nobody is.

43:36.718 --> 43:40.013
Look, you don't have to say anything.
Just go ask her to do a duet with you.

43:40.138 --> 43:42.599
The healing starts right now.

43:42.724 --> 43:45.060
- Come on, go do it.
- OK. Screw it. I'm gonna do it.

43:45.185 --> 43:46.561
Hell, yeah! That's what I like to hear!

43:46.686 --> 43:48.688
- DAVE: There you go.
- That's my bromate right there.

43:49.397 --> 43:52.399
SID: I'm just wondering if you wanted
to maybe sing a duet or something.

43:52.566 --> 43:54.485
- Me?
- SID: Yeah. You look...

43:54.610 --> 43:56.653
- Your pipe seems...
- (LAUGHS) What?

43:56.779 --> 43:59.990
SID: I can see...
I can sense great pipes upon you.

44:00.366 --> 44:06.121
Didn't we almost have it all

44:07.456 --> 44:13.045
When love was all we had worth giving?

44:13.170 --> 44:14.505
(WOMAN CHUCKLES)

44:14.588 --> 44:21.136
The ride with you was worth the fall,
my friend

44:21.929 --> 44:26.141
Loving you makes life worth living

44:26.475 --> 44:29.186
That was amazing. I can't believe
you can hit those high notes.

44:29.311 --> 44:31.105
- You can hit the high notes.
- No.

44:31.230 --> 44:34.274
- Dar, what time is your flight?
- I have to go.

44:34.692 --> 44:36.026
Go? What? Why?

44:36.110 --> 44:38.987
Yeah. I have a flight to catch
in, like, an hour from now.

44:39.154 --> 44:41.865
- Seriously? Wait. Do you not live here?
- No.

44:41.991 --> 44:43.867
I came out
for my friend's bachelorette party.

44:43.993 --> 44:47.453
I have to be at a beauty pageant
tomorrow in Amarillo.

44:47.620 --> 44:48.746
A beauty pageant? Seriously?

44:48.871 --> 44:53.835
Yes. I have to be at Sturbridge Park
in less than 12 hours and 14 minutes.

44:53.960 --> 44:56.963
That... that's amazing.
But I'm obviously kind of bummed.

44:57.046 --> 44:58.381
I feel like we were hitting it off.

44:58.548 --> 45:02.635
- Oh, me too. You're really sweet.
- Well, fly safe.

45:02.760 --> 45:04.721
- Thank you. All right.
- SID: It was nice meeting you.

45:04.846 --> 45:06.431
- Bye.
- Bye. I love you.

45:06.597 --> 45:08.391
- Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.

45:08.558 --> 45:10.435
Goodbye. I love you so much.

45:10.601 --> 45:13.146
- Well, bye.
- MAN: Thanks for being here tonight.

45:13.271 --> 45:15.523
Please remember we are here
every Wednesday...

45:15.690 --> 45:16.983
Uh...

45:18.317 --> 45:20.695
- I'll... OK. Yeah.
- OK.

45:20.862 --> 45:22.822
- Have fun.
- OK.

45:24.198 --> 45:25.283
Was he gonna stay?

45:25.408 --> 45:28.202
(COUNTRY MUSIC)

45:28.328 --> 45:30.121
Hey, man.
Why are you sitting here by yourself?

45:30.288 --> 45:32.498
- Yeah. What's wrong?
- She left.

45:33.458 --> 45:34.917
No, I know what you did.

45:35.043 --> 45:37.295
I bet
you started talking about solar energy

45:37.420 --> 45:41.089
and it dried up her vajayjay,
got it all nice and dry, right? Hm-hmm?

45:41.757 --> 45:42.758
If you must know,

45:42.883 --> 45:45.844
she actually has an early beauty pageant
tomorrow in Amarillo, Texas.

45:45.969 --> 45:47.095
A beauty pageant?

45:47.220 --> 45:49.097
- Is that still a thing?
- Yeah.

45:49.181 --> 45:50.515
- Hey.
- DAVE: Cool.

45:50.640 --> 45:53.018
It sounds like
Charlotte is up there doing our song.

45:53.143 --> 45:55.812
Come on, there's no way that's Char...
Yeah, that is Charlotte.

45:55.937 --> 45:58.690
Do it, do it, do it, do it now

45:58.815 --> 46:00.859
Hell, no. That's my song.
She can't be doing that.

46:00.942 --> 46:02.861
I'll be right back.
She can't take this from me.

46:02.986 --> 46:04.154
All right. Oh, he's running.

46:04.279 --> 46:06.198
Shake your body,
don't stop, don't miss

46:06.323 --> 46:08.867
- Fuck this! That's my song.
- Oh, my God.

46:08.992 --> 46:11.036
Oh, that's what we're doing?

46:11.119 --> 46:14.581
Lick it good,
suck this pussy just like you should

46:15.082 --> 46:16.833
Right now, lick it good

46:16.958 --> 46:19.002
Suck this pussy just like you should

46:19.086 --> 46:20.921
My neck, my back

46:21.046 --> 46:23.256
Lick my pussy and my...

46:25.092 --> 46:26.134

46:26.259 --> 46:29.262
- MAN: OK. You can't unsee that.
- (SLOW CLAPPING)

46:30.430 --> 46:32.307
Man, can we please
just get up out of here?

46:32.432 --> 46:35.644
Hey, fine by me. This place
is full of singing douchebags.

46:35.768 --> 46:38.020
- It's a karaoke bar.
- Look, let's go to Amarillo.

46:38.145 --> 46:40.147
- What?
- She all but invited you, man.

46:40.231 --> 46:41.524
Plus, she's in a beauty pageant.

46:41.649 --> 46:43.818
Which is still a thing, I looked it up.

46:43.943 --> 46:46.529
- Fuck, yeah.
- I'm not going to Texas. It's insane.

46:46.696 --> 46:48.990
I have to close the Harmony Vale deal
in two days.

46:49.115 --> 46:52.868
Oh, my God. I'm so... I'm so bored.

46:52.994 --> 46:56.622
I am not screwing up my career to chase
some girl I just met. That's crazy.

46:56.789 --> 46:59.291
Brother, as your bromate,
listen to reason.

46:59.375 --> 47:02.169
OK. First, we'll be back in one day.
We need one day to do this.

47:02.253 --> 47:04.630
Secondly, look, man,
you'll be a better salesperson

47:04.755 --> 47:06.799
once you get a little R and R in you.

47:06.924 --> 47:08.884
And third, and I don't mean
to guilt you with this,

47:09.010 --> 47:11.178
but you haven't really
been there for us lately.

47:11.554 --> 47:13.514
- You haven't.
- No. You were never there for me.

47:13.681 --> 47:15.683
Seriously.
You were never there for him or me.

47:16.225 --> 47:18.144
Look, man,
you have a chance to do something

47:18.269 --> 47:20.104
that's gonna make everybody feel good

47:20.187 --> 47:22.064
while we're helping you
at the same time.

47:22.189 --> 47:25.526
- Let's take this trip. Come on.
- Please?

47:25.693 --> 47:27.069
- Come on, Sid.
- Don't bitch out.

47:27.194 --> 47:28.696
- Fine, fine.
- Yes.

47:28.821 --> 47:29.989
(ALL LAUGH)

47:30.156 --> 47:31.489
Let's do this.

47:32.532 --> 47:36.244
Amarillo. Amarillo.

47:36.411 --> 47:42.250
Amarillo. Amarillo. Amarillo.

47:42.375 --> 47:44.878
Amarillo!

47:45.003 --> 47:46.421
- All right.
- I didn't get to sing.

47:46.546 --> 47:48.381
SID:
For the record, it is a terrible idea

47:48.506 --> 47:50.175
to go all the way to Amarillo
for a girl.

47:50.258 --> 47:52.886
JONESIE: You're not going for a girl,
you're going for the adventure.

47:53.053 --> 47:54.971
SID: I can't believe
I got a fucking middle seat.

47:55.138 --> 47:56.222
This is bullshit.

48:17.577 --> 48:19.454
- Hey, hey, hey. No, no. Give me that.
- What?

48:19.579 --> 48:21.665
You're not following your ex
on Instagram anymore.

48:21.790 --> 48:24.626
You don't have the Find My Phone app?
I'm putting that shit on there now.

48:24.793 --> 48:27.878
And I need your passwords, too,
cos bromates do that type of stuff.

48:27.961 --> 48:30.798
Ooh, I wanna get some duty-free
wrinkle cream while we're here.

48:32.216 --> 48:36.387
Hi, there. We'd like to rent a car.
Maybe something fun for a boys' weekend.

48:36.512 --> 48:38.138
That sounds fun.

48:38.263 --> 48:41.183
I'm so sorry that we are entirely
sold out with the big weekend.

48:41.517 --> 48:43.977
- You might wanna try Millenial.
- Sorry. Who?

48:44.603 --> 48:47.022
Millenial. They're...

48:47.147 --> 48:49.692
Uh, well, they're new.

48:50.984 --> 48:52.778
OK. Thanks.

48:55.990 --> 48:59.994
Hey. We'd like to rent a car.
Maybe something fun for a boys' weekend.

49:00.119 --> 49:03.747
I'm glad you guys are woke enough
to come to Millenial.

49:03.872 --> 49:08.419
We're not like
those other basic car rental companies.

49:09.670 --> 49:10.713
I can't even...

49:11.672 --> 49:14.508
Cool. But you guys have vehicles, right?

49:15.134 --> 49:16.719
You're hilarious.

49:17.720 --> 49:19.805
Not only do we have them,

49:22.849 --> 49:27.311
they're on Fleek,
and we charge about 30% less.

49:28.312 --> 49:29.605
Sorry, not sorry.

49:31.315 --> 49:34.277
Our rental car 2.0 business model

49:34.360 --> 49:38.281
allows us to augment our fees
with ad revenue

49:38.406 --> 49:40.575
so we can pass the savings...

49:42.452 --> 49:43.828
to our custees.

49:44.662 --> 49:48.583
Oh, please don't call us that.
OK. Yeah. Great. We're in. Sure.

49:49.334 --> 49:51.294
OK. Let me see.

49:51.377 --> 49:53.379
(TYPES)

49:58.009 --> 50:00.261
(CONTINUES TYPING)

50:01.971 --> 50:06.768
I have a Ford Focus in spot 62
that's... fire.

50:08.186 --> 50:09.645
Amarillo.

50:10.897 --> 50:14.859
Oh, before we get there, I just wanna
let all you bitches know I call shotgun.

50:19.029 --> 50:20.906
- I'm not sitting in that.
- Nope. You called it.

50:21.031 --> 50:22.407
Come on. Get in the car.

50:22.532 --> 50:24.159
- I got shotgun.
- Take a seat, Maxi Mike.

50:25.327 --> 50:27.371
It's the first time
I've ever touched one. (LAUGHS)

50:27.496 --> 50:28.872
Fucking Millenial.

50:29.373 --> 50:30.582
I got shotgun.

50:31.541 --> 50:35.379
All right, guys, I have you
in two adjoining nonsmoking rooms

50:35.504 --> 50:37.130
on the second floor for one night.

50:37.631 --> 50:39.925
A hundred and eighty dollars
for a carriage ride.

50:40.050 --> 50:42.928
- Fucking cobblestone robbery.
- You know, it's really nice.

50:43.970 --> 50:45.347
- This place sucks.
- OK.

50:45.597 --> 50:48.016
- Easy, man. Come on.
- Is everything OK?

50:48.141 --> 50:49.643
It's lovely. Thank you.

50:49.768 --> 50:52.729
I think, uh,
6:00 a.m. for our flight tomorrow?

50:52.896 --> 50:53.897
I'll do 5:30.

50:53.980 --> 50:57.150
How come my room doesn't have
a reading nook? Always getting screwed.

50:57.275 --> 51:00.028
Forget your reading area.
Who gives a damn about no reading area?

51:00.153 --> 51:04.449
How about this? I bet you $7.58

51:04.908 --> 51:07.077
you're gonna drink
every nip in that minibar.

51:07.452 --> 51:10.163
- Yeah.
- Hmm, I can one up you.

51:10.288 --> 51:12.665
Twelve forty-three says you won't put
this cactus down your pants.

51:12.748 --> 51:14.542
(LAUGHS)

51:14.667 --> 51:16.919
- Done. Give me that.
- Really?

51:17.044 --> 51:22.383
Yeah. You know, I don't care.
I'm the king of betting and dares.

51:22.508 --> 51:23.843
Oh!

51:24.010 --> 51:26.303
OK. It's there. (GRUNTS)

51:26.387 --> 51:30.349
- Done.
- Hell, yeah! (LAUGHS)

51:30.433 --> 51:32.226
Something's wrong with... Runway Dave.

51:32.351 --> 51:35.021
I bet you $11.44
you won't lick this remote.

51:35.187 --> 51:36.355
That's disgusting.

51:36.647 --> 51:40.401
- Runway Dave?
- DAVE: I'm in the bathroom.

51:40.484 --> 51:44.155
Oh, we don't have time
for a Runway Dave bath. I'll get him.

51:44.947 --> 51:46.991
Hurry up. We got a good bet for you.

51:47.783 --> 51:50.244
Hey, we gotta hurry
and get to the page...ha!

51:51.329 --> 51:53.497
(CHUCKLES)

51:57.793 --> 52:01.213
If you guys had ever bothered to ask
my type, you would know I like bears.

52:03.049 --> 52:06.634
- I'm more of a cub. I'm a cub.
- Yeah.

52:11.264 --> 52:12.891
This can't be right.

52:14.059 --> 52:16.019
She said Sturbridge Park.

52:16.478 --> 52:21.775
Welcome to the Redneck Fest...
(WHEEZES)

52:21.941 --> 52:23.610
(COUGHS)

52:24.944 --> 52:26.029
Festival.

52:26.154 --> 52:28.531
Is there a beauty pageant here?

52:28.823 --> 52:32.827
Finest kind. Redneck Beauty Pageant.

52:32.994 --> 52:36.164
OK. (LAUGHS)

52:36.456 --> 52:39.209
Yes! I love that.

52:39.292 --> 52:41.753
Are you... are you also gonna be
competing in the beauty pageant?

52:42.504 --> 52:44.297
You're a sweetheart, aren't you?

52:44.547 --> 52:47.509
- OK.
- And parking is...

52:47.592 --> 52:49.678
- Extra.
- OK.

52:49.803 --> 52:52.514
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

52:52.639 --> 52:54.891
Have I died and gone to bear heaven?

52:55.058 --> 52:57.352
That's right, honey.
Sleeves are wasted on you.

52:57.519 --> 52:59.521
Whoo-hoo! (LAUGHS)

52:59.688 --> 53:01.939
Let's definitely not do that.
Let's go find the pageant.

53:02.106 --> 53:04.650
Hold on. Hold on.

53:04.817 --> 53:06.819
Yes! That game is mine.

53:07.027 --> 53:09.530
That's a redneck ringer. Yoo-hoo!

53:09.655 --> 53:12.241
That dirty toilet seat game
is calling my name.

53:12.366 --> 53:15.035
I need to go over there and dominate
as the clutch player I am.

53:15.160 --> 53:16.537
- I'll be right back.
- Go, baby.

53:17.663 --> 53:18.580
Thank you.

53:29.049 --> 53:30.926
(YELLS)

53:33.512 --> 53:35.264
(YELPS)

53:35.556 --> 53:36.807
Oh.

53:37.850 --> 53:40.644
(CHEERING)

53:41.729 --> 53:43.397
How you doing, Rednecks?

53:46.442 --> 53:48.944
All right.
We are down to our two finalists.

53:49.111 --> 53:53.240
Let's give a warm redneck welcome
back to the stage,

53:53.324 --> 53:56.534
Smokin' Suzie!

53:56.659 --> 53:58.328
(CHEERING)

53:58.453 --> 53:59.537
Yeah!

53:59.620 --> 54:03.124
Oh, yeah. Go, Suzie. Go, Suzie.

54:03.291 --> 54:05.793
Yeah. Come on.

54:13.801 --> 54:14.927
Yeah!

54:17.847 --> 54:21.434
It's gonna take a month or two for you
to get rid of that smoker's breath.

54:21.559 --> 54:22.935
(CHEERING)

54:24.437 --> 54:26.648
I don't see her anywhere.
Maybe we're in the wrong place.

54:26.731 --> 54:31.069
Now our next finalist,
Darlene and her pet ferret,

54:31.611 --> 54:33.655
- Nibbles.

55:04.142 --> 55:05.143
Nice ferret!

55:05.227 --> 55:06.853
- I'm impressed.
- Way to work, ferret.

55:06.979 --> 55:09.856
- Whoo!
- Let's cheer 'em on, folks. Come on!

55:10.023 --> 55:12.734
Look at that! Look at that!

55:14.611 --> 55:19.741
Go, Darlene! Look at Darlene go.
Yee-haw!

55:21.159 --> 55:22.786
Oh, that's my girl.

55:22.911 --> 55:23.954
(BURPS)

55:24.997 --> 55:25.914
Whoa.

55:26.540 --> 55:28.875
- (LAUGHS)
- We have a winner.

55:29.376 --> 55:32.629
OK. OK.

55:33.046 --> 55:36.466
Here she comes. Redneck Queen.

55:36.550 --> 55:39.302
All bow down before the Queen.

55:40.220 --> 55:41.555
- Yeah.
- All right, everyone.

55:41.680 --> 55:44.975
ANNOUNCER: Let's stick around
for the slippery pig competition.

55:45.142 --> 55:46.434
You need to stop this, Darlene.

55:46.559 --> 55:48.769
You did not see this prize package
I just won?

55:48.894 --> 55:51.355
Duct tape, a tub of nightcrawlers,

55:51.480 --> 55:54.942
and a lifetime supply
of Cattleman's Cut beef jerky.

55:55.067 --> 55:57.361
But I've seen the way
you look at that ferret.

55:57.778 --> 56:00.406
It's like you love that critter
more than you love your boyfriend.

56:00.489 --> 56:01.449
(GASPS)

56:01.699 --> 56:06.871
You think it's cuter than me? Answer me.
Darlene, this conversation ain't over.

56:06.996 --> 56:11.334
Talk to the hand, because this
Redneck Beauty Queen ain't listening.

56:12.376 --> 56:14.378
It is cuter than me.

56:14.837 --> 56:16.964
- That was something.
- It's crazy.

56:17.715 --> 56:18.591
Oh, there she goes.

56:20.593 --> 56:23.346
- I'm gonna talk to her.
- Go do that, man. Go get your queen.

56:23.971 --> 56:26.766
- All right.
- King Sid, I see you man. (CHUCKLES)

56:26.891 --> 56:28.642
If anyone offers you crystal meth,
don't do it.

56:29.101 --> 56:30.436
(KISSES) Hi.

56:33.397 --> 56:34.899
- Darlene.
- Huh?

56:34.982 --> 56:36.317
- Darlene. Hey.
- Hey.

56:36.484 --> 56:41.279
Sid, from... from... from karaoke,
like, 12 hours ago.

56:41.863 --> 56:42.864
Oh, wow.

56:42.989 --> 56:45.700
I'm just kind of realizing
how insane this all sounds

56:45.867 --> 56:47.994
and you must be potentially creeped out.

56:48.119 --> 56:52.624
So, um, I'm gonna let you go
and maybe go hang with my friends.

56:52.707 --> 56:55.543
I'm sorry to... Sorry, but take care.

56:55.669 --> 56:57.379
- It's good to see you. Take care.
- Hey.

56:58.505 --> 57:01.591
I think it's really sweet
that you came all this way for me.

57:02.342 --> 57:03.385
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:03.510 --> 57:05.261
Would you like to get out of here?

57:06.638 --> 57:07.806
Like, together?

57:08.556 --> 57:12.060
Yeah. As long as you have a car
and it doesn't have a baby in it.

57:12.477 --> 57:15.146
Yeah. But don't judge me, OK?

57:16.022 --> 57:17.857
- (CAR BEEPS)
- (LAUGHS)

57:17.983 --> 57:21.611
Nice. Hey, good to know
you have a feminine side.

57:27.575 --> 57:28.827
Home sweet home.

57:28.952 --> 57:33.415
So we do get a lot of flies on account
of being next to the fish plant.

57:33.540 --> 57:35.750
- Oh, is there a fish plant nearby?
- Yeah.

57:35.833 --> 57:37.835
(FLIES BUZZ)

57:38.002 --> 57:39.670
Here we are.

57:41.380 --> 57:44.883
All right, Nibbles, we're home.

57:45.676 --> 57:46.593
(SQUEAKS)

57:46.719 --> 57:49.013
- Come on.
- You're just letting him out.

57:49.346 --> 57:50.431
Yeah.

57:52.266 --> 57:54.351
He's gonna free ball it. Wow.

57:54.476 --> 57:58.480
So I'm gonna go change into something
a little bit more comfortable.

57:59.356 --> 58:04.486
Cool. Yeah,
I'll just be here with the wild animal.

58:04.570 --> 58:05.821
DARLENE: Play with him.

58:05.946 --> 58:08.449
Oh, um, actually, do you think
I could use your...

58:08.574 --> 58:10.826
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- ...uh, bathroom?

58:11.827 --> 58:14.079
You don't have a second one, do you?

58:14.204 --> 58:17.082
No, obviously not. It's a trailer.

58:17.207 --> 58:19.752
Oh, OK. Pee...

58:20.502 --> 58:22.963
I'm not gonna make it. Uh...

58:24.048 --> 58:27.551
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm not gonna make it. Come on, come on.

58:29.845 --> 58:31.637
(UNZIPS PANTS)

58:31.721 --> 58:34.432
Aaah!

58:34.557 --> 58:36.100
Shit!

58:36.851 --> 58:38.936
What's up? Where you at?
We're ready to get out of here.

58:39.020 --> 58:40.813
Hit me back if you get a chance.

58:41.648 --> 58:44.192
I just supported your family big time.

58:44.567 --> 58:46.361
Oh, and I just drank
the rest of your drink.

58:46.486 --> 58:48.363
- Oh, fuck.
- Big time. (LAUGHS)

58:49.155 --> 58:50.365
Hey, brother. Hey.

58:50.448 --> 58:52.825
I appreciate the work you're doing.
You, I'm talking to you.

58:54.952 --> 58:58.373
Thanks for noticing.
I don't normally get compliments.

58:58.498 --> 59:00.833
Yeah. I could barely smell the piss
and shit around here, man.

59:00.917 --> 59:04.545
- You're killin' it.
- Wow, man. Thank you.

59:04.671 --> 59:05.922
My name's Walt.

59:06.214 --> 59:07.507
- Oh, God.
- Wow.

59:07.674 --> 59:08.883
- That's him.
- What's your name?

59:09.008 --> 59:11.928
That's the fella who hit Aunt Thelma
in the head with a toilet seat.

59:12.053 --> 59:15.014
Nobody hits Aunt Thelma in the head with
a toilet seat and gets away with it.

59:15.139 --> 59:18.476
Look here, man. I threw the toilet seat
by fucking mistake.

59:18.601 --> 59:22.605
- I'm sorry.
- Hold on. Hold on. You wanna go, bro?

59:22.855 --> 59:25.608
Yeah. I want you to go round back

59:25.733 --> 59:28.610
and get the hell out of here
before I whip your scrawny little ass.

59:28.735 --> 59:30.779
OK. I was hoping for this,

59:30.904 --> 59:32.614
but you better hope
you never see me again,

59:32.781 --> 59:34.658
because it'll be
your worst fucking nightmare.

59:35.283 --> 59:39.037
Well, I dream about clowns having
orgies, buddy, so I sincerely doubt it.

59:39.329 --> 59:41.206
Hold this. Let's go fight.

59:43.625 --> 59:45.127
(COUGHS)

59:51.508 --> 59:52.801
She's not gonna make it, right?

59:52.926 --> 59:54.511
- No, I don't think so.
- Yeah.

59:54.678 --> 59:56.096
- (SIZZLING)
- Huh?

01:00:00.517 --> 01:00:01.935
Shit!

01:00:02.853 --> 01:00:05.063
- (SQUEAKS)
- (SCREAMS) What?

01:00:09.735 --> 01:00:10.902
(SIGHS)

01:00:11.028 --> 01:00:13.280
Is something burning?

01:00:13.488 --> 01:00:17.284
What? Oh.
Hmm. You know what I bet it is?

01:00:17.451 --> 01:00:21.912
It's probably the sun just giving off
175 petawatts of energy.

01:00:21.996 --> 01:00:26.917
No, it smells like old meat
and human hair.

01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:31.213
- Old?
- Yeah. Here. Let me show you around.

01:00:31.339 --> 01:00:33.257
- SID: Oh, yeah.
- Are you ready?

01:00:34.967 --> 01:00:36.761
Here's my bathroom.

01:00:36.844 --> 01:00:40.264
Oh, yeah. That would've come in handy
a couple seconds ago.

01:00:40.765 --> 01:00:44.769
- Here's my bedroom.
- Oh.

01:00:44.894 --> 01:00:46.854
More ferrets. Cool.

01:00:46.979 --> 01:00:48.939

This is really... oh!

01:00:53.194 --> 01:00:55.154
- OK.
- I'm so glad to have you here.

01:00:55.279 --> 01:00:56.822
Oh, me too. Thanks for having me.

01:01:05.247 --> 01:01:06.666
Oh, wow.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.129
Hey, Sid.

01:01:12.546 --> 01:01:15.466
Hey, Jeff Gordon tattoo.

01:01:16.007 --> 01:01:17.509
What you doin', man?

01:01:17.801 --> 01:01:22.180
I think I'm about to have sex
with a really hot redneck beauty queen.

01:01:22.305 --> 01:01:24.933
Hmm, yeah. Talk dirty to me.

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:28.937
Whoa. Caution flags out.

01:01:30.397 --> 01:01:34.985
That 110 volts you took to the dick
scrambled your brain.

01:01:35.068 --> 01:01:36.403
You're not thinking straight, bro.

01:01:37.278 --> 01:01:42.492
Whoa. You make a lot of sense,
Jeff Gordon tattoo.

01:01:44.411 --> 01:01:45.620
So wise.

01:01:46.830 --> 01:01:48.540
So wise.

01:01:51.001 --> 01:01:55.255
- Here. It's chamomile.
- Oh, thanks.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.758
Hey, listen, I... I hope
you know it's nothing to do with you.

01:01:58.883 --> 01:02:02.887
I mean, you're so pretty
and... and sweet,

01:02:03.013 --> 01:02:06.516
and you got that bitchin' Jeff Gordon
tattoo, which was a fun reveal.

01:02:08.435 --> 01:02:12.479
It's just that I'm struggling to figure
out how to get over my ex-girlfriend.

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:14.064
And somehow I don't think

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:17.651
having sex with someone I just met
is the way to do it, you know?

01:02:21.864 --> 01:02:23.365
Oh, my God. It's my ex-boyfriend.

01:02:23.532 --> 01:02:25.659
- Uh, boyfriend?
- That's Harlan.

01:02:25.826 --> 01:02:28.996
He's like a bad yeast infection
that I can't get rid of.

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:31.081
- You need to run and hide, please.
- Hide?

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:32.541
- This way.
- It's a trailer.

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:34.460
- Where am I gonna...
- Just go here.

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:37.004
(BANGING ON DOOR)

01:02:38.047 --> 01:02:40.591
Why am I knocking?
Get in there. Darlene?

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:45.012
Why is there a car covered
in lady products parked out front? Hmm?

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:46.555
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:02:46.722 --> 01:02:49.058
You know it frightens me
what you all put up there.

01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:51.226
- You hiding something from me?
- No.

01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:54.396
Like when you took
that haiku-writing class? I remember.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.939
- (PHONE RINGS)
- You remember. Wait.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.149
(HARLAN LAUGHS)

01:02:57.274 --> 01:03:00.319
- You left that.
- Oh, where is he?

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:01.862
- Where is he? Huh?
- Who?

01:03:01.987 --> 01:03:06.908
This place ain't that big. Hey,
you look in this wing. I'll check...

01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:08.076
Oh, buddy.

01:03:10.078 --> 01:03:13.122
- Open up, panty shield man.
- No, thank you.

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:16.334
Hi. Here's your phone, buddy.

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:18.044
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:20.713
- And I got your new ringtone.
- No. (GROANS)

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:29.430
Well, looks like
this prize package was useful, Darlene.

01:03:29.555 --> 01:03:31.307
Harlan, I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:34.477
You ain't got nobody to blame in this
but yourself.

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.688
Take a long look in the mirror, sister.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.190
This wouldn't have happened
if you wouldn't have cheated on me

01:03:39.273 --> 01:03:42.443
with some sicko
who sells feminine hygiene products.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:45.321
Oh, I actually sell
solar energy products.

01:03:45.446 --> 01:03:48.908
Tampons ain't powered by the sun.

01:03:49.033 --> 01:03:51.703
I'm no gynecologist
but even I know that.

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:54.080
- Hit us back.
- 16.93.

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:57.583
I bet you, you won't let me put this
iron on your ass for two whole seconds.

01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:01.837
Dude, I tried Sid, like, ten times.
Something gotta be wrong.

01:04:01.962 --> 01:04:04.339
- Can you track his phone?
- Yeah. What's his password?

01:04:06.049 --> 01:04:09.720
It makes me sick saying this
but, uh, Sadielady.

01:04:10.554 --> 01:04:13.724
Oh, my God. It is.

01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:15.767
He's in a trailer park.

01:04:16.393 --> 01:04:18.854
Hey, Runway Dave, can you look up
Muckraker Road?

01:04:18.937 --> 01:04:21.523
- 3200, Muckraker Road.
- Look up what?

01:04:25.527 --> 01:04:27.446
I should probably head back
to reception.

- Don't act like you're on the clock.

JONESIE: I didn't know
Google Maps had real-time views.

01:04:51.219 --> 01:04:54.056
What? No. This is a military satellite.

01:04:54.181 --> 01:04:56.182
I told you guys
I work in black ops, right?

01:04:56.265 --> 01:04:57.308
(BEEPING)

01:04:57.433 --> 01:05:00.144
You really know nothing about my life.

01:05:00.227 --> 01:05:02.438
Anyway, ooh, I see the trailer.

01:05:03.064 --> 01:05:04.440
And there's the Maxi pad mobile.

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:09.320
- Oh, Sid's gotta be inside there.
- Question is, who is he with?

01:05:09.487 --> 01:05:10.446
MIKE: I know that guy.

01:05:10.613 --> 01:05:12.948
That's the dumb shit from the pageant.
I was gonna kick his ass.

01:05:13.074 --> 01:05:15.284
There's no way Sid
would willingly hang out with that guy.

01:05:15.743 --> 01:05:16.911
Something must have gone wrong.

01:05:17.036 --> 01:05:19.080
- You guys thinking what I'm thinking?
- Hell, yeah.

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:22.083
It's time to escalate this
from a surveillance operation

01:05:22.208 --> 01:05:23.167
to a rescue mission.

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:26.212
I'm gonna go to housekeeping and see
if they got chloroform and zip ties.

01:05:26.295 --> 01:05:27.505
Stand down, soldier.

01:05:27.797 --> 01:05:33.177
As the highest-ranking military officer

There's a dude doing a runway model walk
out in the backyard.

if it would be possible

01:12:10.609 --> 01:12:13.737
for us to get our friend back
from you there.

01:12:16.906 --> 01:12:19.784
- You can buy him back.
- SID: Uh-huh.

01:12:20.368 --> 01:12:23.246
Well, it's just they took our wallets,
so I don't have any money right now.

around here.

who bailed us out?

- Who do you think it is, man?

Now honestly,
I was pissed off at you guys.

it is to breathe,

01:13:50.165 --> 01:13:54.252
to think, to enjoy, to love."

my grandma's old-school car,

fair exchange, no robbery.

begging Charlotte
to forgive you for being an idiot

01:17:19.996 --> 01:17:21.164
and asking her to take you back.

01:17:21.539 --> 01:17:23.249
A, OK, that's a dumb idea.

01:17:23.416 --> 01:17:25.251
And B,
bromates don't call each other idiots.

01:17:25.418 --> 01:17:27.712
We don't call each other names.
That's not what bromates do.

01:17:27.837 --> 01:17:30.590
We're not bromates. There's no such
fucking thing as bromates.

01:17:30.715 --> 01:17:32.759
It's just a dumb term you made up
to make us feel better

01:17:32.925 --> 01:17:35.219
about being losers
whose girlfriends dumped us,

01:17:35.345 --> 01:17:36.262

- Man, fuck you.

- No, no, no. Fuck you.
- Fuck yourself!

to cause a disruption.

01:18:22.015 --> 01:18:24.017
- You wrecked it.
- It's in your name.

01:18:41.492 --> 01:18:43.202
I don't know.
You gave us the Maxi pad car.

What did you think was gonna happen?

01:18:46.747 --> 01:18:50.543
Hold on. I need to speak with my boss.

01:18:59.719 --> 01:19:04.181
Um, the... Hummus Hut car
would have been a nice alternative.

01:19:05.224 --> 01:19:09.312
- It's got a roof rack.
- What the fuck?

01:19:15.276 --> 01:19:17.653

Oh. Thanks.

I really thought
bromates for life, but...

01:19:35.129 --> 01:19:37.172
I guess bromates for three weeks
will have to do.

01:19:37.505 --> 01:19:41.259
Yeah. Take care, man.

- Of course.

It's not a problem.

I mean, life is short, right?

01:20:48.367 --> 01:20:52.997
You know, we gotta stop and make
a conscious decision to enjoy it.

01:20:53.163 --> 01:20:55.082
Much like how we enjoyed
his grandma's Earl Grey tea

01:20:55.207 --> 01:20:56.667

I don't know,
if there's one thing I have learned

if you don't let go of the past,

you can't really make room for all
the good stuff the future might bring.

But...

01:26:55.061 --> 01:26:59.439
the pain I've been through has helped me
see that while I always feared

01:26:59.523 --> 01:27:02.401
that I wasn't enough
in our relationship,

01:27:02.526 --> 01:27:03.777

that wasn't really there.

- No, we're not.
- What?

01:28:54.970 --> 01:28:56.221
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:28:56.346 --> 01:28:59.516
- We're bromates for life.
- Come here. I love you, man.

01:28:59.891 --> 01:29:01.851
(SIGHS) Wow.

01:29:02.268 --> 01:29:03.561
Thank you.

01:29:17.617 --> 01:29:19.577
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:29:19.661 --> 01:29:21.621
- How you doin'?
- (CHUCKLES)

01:29:21.997 --> 01:29:24.499
Going to Cabo for work, for fun or...?

01:29:24.791 --> 01:29:28.295
A photo shoot, uh, for
the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.

01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:30.797
- Oh, wow. I've heard of it.
- What about you?

01:29:31.131 --> 01:29:32.424
Uh, a little of both.

01:29:32.549 --> 01:29:37.387
I... I closed this deal for work
and they're sending me on vacation.

01:29:37.512 --> 01:29:39.055
I'm in solar energy.

01:29:39.514 --> 01:29:41.098
I guess we both kind of are, right?

01:29:41.849 --> 01:29:44.643
You know, cos...
cos you'll be on a beach in the sun.

01:29:44.768 --> 01:29:47.521
You know what? Do you mind
taking a picture for my Instagram?

01:29:47.646 --> 01:29:50.441
Oh, sure. Yeah.

01:29:52.943 --> 01:29:54.903
You know what? Sorry.

01:29:55.029 --> 01:29:56.697
No. No.

01:29:57.239 --> 01:29:59.742
(LAUGHS) Excuse me?

01:30:00.242 --> 01:30:02.286
Sorry. I just don't get social media.

01:30:02.411 --> 01:30:04.121
I mean, why can't people just live life

01:30:04.246 --> 01:30:07.750
instead of constantly trying
to caption it, and like it, and...

01:30:10.336 --> 01:30:11.503
Can I change seats, please?

01:30:12.087 --> 01:30:13.464
Oh, no, no.

01:30:14.423 --> 01:30:18.344
That's OK. I'll move.
Is there somewhere I could...? Great.

01:30:18.469 --> 01:30:21.680
Have a nice flight. Thank you.

01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:25.017
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome on board...

01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:28.437
Sorry. Can I squeeze in here? Excuse me.
(GRUNTS)

01:30:28.562 --> 01:30:32.775
Sorry. Sorry. OK. Oh, jeez.

01:30:32.942 --> 01:30:34.109
Sid?

01:30:34.568 --> 01:30:37.570
- Is that you?
- Brooke? What?

01:30:38.696 --> 01:30:39.697
What are the odds?

01:30:39.781 --> 01:30:42.075
I know.
I love that you're on this flight.

01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:44.744
- It's great to see you.
- Great to see you.

01:30:45.411 --> 01:30:47.789
- We're going to Cabo.
- Yeah.

01:30:56.297 --> 01:30:58.424
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

01:30:58.549 --> 01:31:01.761
- Oh, great. Thank you.
- Yes.

01:31:04.889 --> 01:31:07.350
- To new beginnings.
- To new beginnings.

01:31:08.768 --> 01:31:10.687
Hey! (LAUGHS)

01:31:10.770 --> 01:31:14.148
Hey! You guys got a hammock, huh?
(LAUGHS)

01:31:14.315 --> 01:31:17.360
- How great is this?
- Yeah. We're enjoying it.

01:31:17.485 --> 01:31:20.321
This is a nice one, huh? Let me in.
I wanna try it. Coming in hot.

01:31:20.446 --> 01:31:22.699
I didn't think
that's where that was headed, all right.

01:31:22.782 --> 01:31:24.033
- Oh, you're wet.
- Oh!

01:31:24.158 --> 01:31:25.868
- Oh, my God. Look at that.
- Look at this. Huh?

01:31:26.035 --> 01:31:27.328
How about that?

01:31:27.453 --> 01:31:29.497
- Wow.
- I think it's a sea bass.

01:31:29.622 --> 01:31:31.665
I don't even know.
I was shooting at a bird. Huh!

01:31:31.748 --> 01:31:33.792
- I don't even know how that happened.
- Why?

01:31:33.875 --> 01:31:35.836
- (GROANS)
- OK. Wow.

01:31:35.919 --> 01:31:37.087
Oh!

01:31:37.254 --> 01:31:38.463
OK.

01:31:39.298 --> 01:31:42.592
- Surf is angry today, my friend.
- Hmm.

01:31:44.344 --> 01:31:47.514
You know, Sid, you made a difference.

01:31:48.849 --> 01:31:51.560
Hey, thank you, sir. Appreciate that.

01:31:54.479 --> 01:31:56.064
She's a beauty, isn't she?

01:32:00.694 --> 01:32:02.195
Yeah, she really is.

01:32:04.156 --> 01:32:05.532
She really is.

01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:19.755
And action.

01:32:19.838 --> 01:32:21.715
Hello. Clos Schweinfurt here.

01:32:21.798 --> 01:32:24.134
Uh, this is
my America's Got Talent audition.

01:32:24.301 --> 01:32:25.594
I am a puppeteer.

01:32:25.719 --> 01:32:28.429
As you can see,
I enjoy to make puppet times.

01:32:28.596 --> 01:32:29.930
Hello. Hello.

01:32:30.056 --> 01:32:32.141
I first began with the puppeteering

01:32:32.224 --> 01:32:35.728
after a very awful, horrific accident
in skiing.

01:32:35.811 --> 01:32:39.231
I accidentally decapitated two children.

01:32:39.398 --> 01:32:40.566
And then I thought

01:32:40.691 --> 01:32:43.819
if I've murdered a child,
how do you fix this?

01:32:43.945 --> 01:32:45.821
You make other childs laugh.

01:32:45.947 --> 01:32:47.949
This is Sasha and this is Ballard.

01:32:48.074 --> 01:32:51.661
They are rough approximations
of the two children,

01:32:51.786 --> 01:32:56.207
um, that I murder...
it was manslau... I mean...

01:32:56.332 --> 01:33:00.920
I did some community service, so I
paid all of my dues. (CLEARS THROAT)

01:33:01.045 --> 01:33:05.716
Um, so, my hope and dream is
to make other children laugh very hard

01:33:05.841 --> 01:33:08.135
to drown out the screams
of the children.

01:33:08.302 --> 01:33:11.222
(SINGS)

01:33:17.436 --> 01:33:19.605
See you soon, Bachelorette.

01:33:21.022 --> 01:33:23.441
To bromates. To bromates.

01:33:23.566 --> 01:33:24.693
Improv.

01:33:26.236 --> 01:33:29.281
- Cut.
- (LAUGHTER)
