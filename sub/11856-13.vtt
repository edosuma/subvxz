WEBVTT

00:17.667 --> 00:21.583
Aren't these gloves the most?
I feel like Princess Grace.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.208
They're lovely, Landon.

00:29.166 --> 00:30.500
I'm sorry.

00:30.583 --> 00:32.375
I'm so sorry.

00:35.709 --> 00:38.709
- Emma, put those back on.
- They hurt my feet.

00:38.792 --> 00:42.625
A young lady must learn
how to walk gracefully in
heels.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.709
Okay, okay.

00:44.792 --> 00:46.709
Do you have your
pocketbook and gloves?

00:46.792 --> 00:48.875
- I'm not gonna wear the
gloves.
- Emma.

00:48.959 --> 00:50.583
I don't want
to cover up your ring.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.625
- Isn't this exciting?
- Sure.

00:54.709 --> 00:57.000
Just think, you'll
walk through that
arch

00:57.083 --> 00:59.375
and everyone will clap
when they announce your name.

00:59.458 --> 01:00.875
But it's not
for doing anything.

01:00.959 --> 01:02.792
It's just for being a girl
and wearing a dress.

01:02.875 --> 01:04.417
Emma, we've talked
about this.

01:05.875 --> 01:08.625
What being part of
this society will mean for
you

01:08.709 --> 01:10.625
for your future.

01:10.709 --> 01:12.417
And you may not
appreciate it
now

01:12.500 --> 01:15.458
but you've made
me very proud.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.125
I want to make you proud
by doing things.

01:17.208 --> 01:20.208
You will. You'll do
things
I've never dreamed of.

01:20.291 --> 01:22.208
Like go to the moon.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.166
Emma,
you are such a modern woman.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.667
Thank you.

01:25.750 --> 01:28.792
Now, how about if I apply
just
the teeniest bit of mascara?

01:28.875 --> 01:29.959
Mother.

01:40.250 --> 01:44.667
Introducing Miss Claire
Brixton Henley.

01:58.333 --> 02:02.208
Introducing Miss Landon
Antoinette Ridgeley.

02:16.083 --> 02:20.208
Introducing Miss Emma
Elizabeth Vine.

02:34.625 --> 02:38.667
Introducing Miss
Emma Elizabeth Vine.

03:23.083 --> 03:26.542
I, Richard Milhous Nixon,
do solemnly swear.

03:26.625 --> 03:29.875
That you will faithfully
execute the office.

03:29.959 --> 03:33.083
I will faithfully
execute the office..

03:40.500 --> 03:42.458
So who's coming to
the Sixers game on Wednesday?

03:42.542 --> 03:45.542
Uh, sorry.
I'm not into hockey.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.667
It's basketball.

03:47.750 --> 03:49.875
No, thanks.

03:49.959 --> 03:51.166
(Vera)
'What about you?'

03:51.250 --> 03:53.583
They're cheap seats
but it's a good time.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.083
Thanks, but I got
something Wednesday.

03:56.166 --> 03:57.166
Like what?

03:58.250 --> 04:00.041
It's personal.

04:03.709 --> 04:05.250
Detective
Rush,
Lillian Vine.

04:06.667 --> 04:07.959
Pleasure to meet you.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.667
(Stillman)
'Mrs. Vine is here about'

04:09.750 --> 04:11.834
Travis Whitman,
the art dealer.

04:11.917 --> 04:13.750
His wife died last month.

04:13.834 --> 04:15.000
Fell down the
stairs
at their home.

04:15.083 --> 04:16.375
Well, that's
his story, at least.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.875
But now he's been charged
with her murder.

04:19.667 --> 04:21.291
Really?

04:21.375 --> 04:24.667
Lillian thinks he could be
responsible for another death.

04:25.583 --> 04:28.125
- Whose?
- My daughter's.

04:28.208 --> 04:30.500
In 1968.

04:30.583 --> 04:33.709
- They were both 18.
- What happened?

04:33.792 --> 04:36.667
Travis escorted Emma
to her debutante ball.

04:37.792 --> 04:40.291
She died that night.

04:40.375 --> 04:43.083
From a fall down the stairs.

04:43.166 --> 04:44.875
And that doesn't
happen
twice in a lifetime.

04:44.959 --> 04:46.500
It's the same death.

04:46.583 --> 04:49.583
Emma's case was put on a shelf
pretty quick after it came in.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.208
- Was it ruled an accident?
- No.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.875
It was handled as
an S-job, suspicious death.

04:53.959 --> 04:55.959
It meant no one looked
at it too closely in '68.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.875
Well, it's 2006 now..

04:59.959 --> 05:01.417
...and we like to look.

05:39.917 --> 05:42.959
What do you
got,
a dead bride?

05:43.041 --> 05:43.959
Debutante.

05:44.041 --> 05:45.625
Emma Elizabeth Vine.

05:45.709 --> 05:47.250
Found at the base
of a flight of stairs

05:47.333 --> 05:49.917
'at the Edgecombe Hotel,
December, '68.'

05:50.000 --> 05:52.250
Spinal fracture,
cracked skull.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.083
- That's a bad fall.
- Or a good shove.

05:54.166 --> 05:55.917
Cops couldn't get
traction on the case.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.917
- No one would talk.
- A white glove conspiracy?

05:58.000 --> 06:01.166
Society people didn't want
a scandal on their hands.

06:01.250 --> 06:02.208
Closed ranks.

06:02.291 --> 06:03.458
We got a suspect now?

06:03.542 --> 06:04.583
Travis Whitman.

06:04.667 --> 06:06.125
He was Emma's escort that night.

06:06.208 --> 06:09.250
And just last month, wound up
with another dead woman

06:09.333 --> 06:11.917
at the bottom
of his stairs, his wife.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.875
He trying to sell
that as a coincidence?

06:13.959 --> 06:16.458
Not too many takers, though.
He was arrested for murder.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.750
Out on bail
at a cool million.

06:18.834 --> 06:20.875
(Rush)
'There's one other thing.
Lillian said Emma'

06:20.959 --> 06:23.208
'was wearing a ring that night.'

06:23.291 --> 06:25.792
A gold swan with
a diamond eye.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.709
But it was missing
from the body.

06:27.792 --> 06:29.208
A lot of people
could have taken
it.

06:29.291 --> 06:32.375
Hotel staff that
found the body, paramedics.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.333
They put out feelers
to pawnshops at the time

06:34.417 --> 06:37.125
seeing if someone tried
to move it, came up empty.

06:37.208 --> 06:38.792
Maybe they waited
until the heat died down?

06:38.875 --> 06:40.291
I'll check sale records.

06:40.375 --> 06:43.875
At the time of the murder,
Emma was living in Fishtown.

06:43.959 --> 06:45.583
That's not
deb recruiting territory.

06:45.667 --> 06:49.834
I don't know, some kind of...
Philly Cinderella?

07:00.959 --> 07:04.917
Handsome, wasn't he?
Even in that
marshmallow.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.417
- Your husband?
- Timothy.

07:07.500 --> 07:11.500
This is the album
from Emma's debutante season.

07:11.583 --> 07:14.417
Pretty important
to Emma, debuting?

07:14.500 --> 07:16.291
To tell you the truth

07:16.375 --> 07:18.750
I was the one
who really wanted
it.

07:18.834 --> 07:20.041
'Yeah?'

07:20.125 --> 07:22.542
I grew up fascinated by debs.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.834
They seemed
so perfect.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.500
Like the whole world was theirs.

07:26.583 --> 07:29.834
You know, my sketchy
understanding of this world

07:29.917 --> 07:31.333
it's wealthy girls, right?

07:31.417 --> 07:34.417
From the Main Line
Chestnut Hill.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.959
But your family
was from Fishtown.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.250
Yes.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.500
So how do you go
from there to..

07:40.583 --> 07:43.166
Having my
own daughter debuted?

07:43.250 --> 07:45.792
Uh...yeah.

07:45.875 --> 07:47.959
We had a different cache.

07:48.041 --> 07:49.667
Timothy.

07:49.750 --> 07:53.000
(Lillian)
'In '68, astronauts
were bigger than the Beatles.'

07:53.083 --> 07:55.917
And my husband was
on the list to go the moon.

07:57.125 --> 07:59.583
All of a sudden,
we were society.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.709
Is there a date yet
for the landing?

08:03.792 --> 08:05.250
Not yet.

08:05.333 --> 08:08.417
To think, your husband
is going to walk on the moon.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.041
I think it will
be next August.

08:10.125 --> 08:11.959
They're sticking
by Kennedy's timetable.

08:12.041 --> 08:13.667
My, you're
well-informed
.

08:13.750 --> 08:16.625
Emma know more than I do.
She loves flying.

08:16.709 --> 08:19.875
- You could be stewardess.
- Or a pilot.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.750
You must be so glad
to have this club, Irene.

08:24.834 --> 08:26.542
Someplace your
children can go and--

08:26.625 --> 08:29.834
(Irene)
'And not be running wild on
the
streets with hippies? Yes.'

08:31.583 --> 08:33.750
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

08:33.834 --> 08:37.000
'Our debutante
season starts soon.'

08:37.083 --> 08:40.500
How would you like Emma
to make her debut?

08:40.583 --> 08:41.750
But Irene, we're just--

08:41.834 --> 08:44.625
The wife and daughter
of an astronaut.

08:44.709 --> 08:46.583
It would be an honor for us.

08:46.667 --> 08:47.583
What would I have to do?

08:47.667 --> 08:49.917
You go to parties all season.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.583
And you bow to your father
in a gorgeous white dress

08:52.667 --> 08:54.083
'when you're
presented at the ball.'

08:54.166 --> 08:55.250
It's very prestigious.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.083
And you'll meet everyone.

08:57.166 --> 09:00.083
And you can take Travis
as your escort.

09:00.166 --> 09:01.542
(Emma)
'Isn't he your boyfriend?'

09:01.625 --> 09:03.291
(Landon)
'But I have to take Chip.'

09:03.375 --> 09:05.291
'It's a business thing
between our dads.'

09:05.375 --> 09:06.625
This way, Travis can come, too.

09:13.208 --> 09:16.542
Oh, this is so lucky.

09:16.625 --> 09:19.208
I would think the girls
had all been chosen by now.

09:19.291 --> 09:21.375
I have some pull in that area.

09:21.458 --> 09:25.583
After all, I am
the Mistress of the Robes.

09:28.834 --> 09:30.125
Mistress of the what?

09:30.208 --> 09:32.458
The titles are
from centuries ago.

09:32.542 --> 09:35.083
It means she was in charge.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.625
Well, it doesn't sound like
this
ball was Emma's type of thing.

09:37.709 --> 09:41.291
She only agreed after
I pointed out the
opportunities

09:41.375 --> 09:44.333
it could mean,
the people she'd meet.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.583
She wanted to go to college.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.417
So you were glad
when she said yes?

09:48.500 --> 09:51.291
Took Travis
as her
escort?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.166
It was the mistake of my life.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.083
Emma have trouble with Travis?

09:58.166 --> 10:00.542
Not if she did,
I was blind to it.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.667
I thought those people
could do no wrong.

10:04.250 --> 10:05.667
I wanted to help her.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.834
Instead, I handed
her over to a murderer.

10:34.041 --> 10:36.458
So...that's the one, huh?

10:37.709 --> 10:38.709
The one?

10:38.792 --> 10:40.417
Painting you like.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.375
It's my job, figuring
out what people like

10:43.458 --> 10:45.000
'what they're
attracted to.'

10:45.083 --> 10:46.041
I learn a lot in this room.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.417
Hope the same
goes for us.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.375
Detective Rush
and Jeffries. Homicide.

10:51.458 --> 10:53.875
Is this about Sadie?

10:53.959 --> 10:56.667
Oh, I've already got a Javert
watching my every move.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.625
That's for your wife's murder.
This is about Emma Vine.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.041
- Emma? She died--
- Thirty eight years ago.

11:04.125 --> 11:07.250
It came up again. Since she
died
exactly the way your wife did.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.458
Respectfully, no.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.250
She didn't fall
down a flight of stairs?

11:10.333 --> 11:11.875
That much is true.

11:11.959 --> 11:14.959
But it's my belief that
Sadie
had a seizure and fell.

11:15.792 --> 11:17.083
She was epileptic.

11:17.166 --> 11:19.583
It's the only thing
that makes any sense.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.250
(Jeffries)
'What about Emma? She have
a medical condition too?'

11:22.333 --> 11:23.458
I hardly knew Emma.

11:25.208 --> 11:27.667
I escorted her to the ball
as a favor to my girlfriend.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.333
- Landon.
- That's right.

11:31.208 --> 11:32.208
I had no motive.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.709
And no clue why she died?

11:33.792 --> 11:37.250
Well, these girls took the
debutante season very
seriously.

11:37.333 --> 11:38.750
- Right.
- There was a bit of talk.

11:38.834 --> 11:42.667
About the fact that Emma
got someone else's spot.

11:42.750 --> 11:44.458
Who was this someone else?

11:44.542 --> 11:46.917
Sloane Kinny. Big boozer.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.083
All-around floozy.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.417
Did Sloane
have it out for
Emma?

11:50.500 --> 11:53.458
Like Emma had yanked the golden
ticket right out of her hand.

11:57.875 --> 12:01.667
I hope you like it.
It's Tricia Nixon's recipe.

12:03.625 --> 12:07.458
So, Sloane, Emma's
dad is an astronaut.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.625
That's the mostest.

12:09.709 --> 12:11.125
(Travis)
'Pretty neat.'

12:11.208 --> 12:12.792
Thanks.

12:12.875 --> 12:15.000
(Landon)
'He's going to be
the first man on the moon.'

12:15.083 --> 12:18.000
And Emma wants to be
the first girl to go to
Harvard.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.458
They don't let
girls into Harvard.

12:19.542 --> 12:20.792
(Chip)
'Sure they do.'

12:20.875 --> 12:22.917
Right after they get off
the bus from Wellesley.

12:25.542 --> 12:28.709
It's just that Harvard has
the best physics program.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.250
You mean, like, P.E.?

12:33.083 --> 12:34.417
(Travis)
'You know,
if you're interested'

12:34.500 --> 12:36.083
there's an echo thing
in the ballroom.

12:36.166 --> 12:37.166
Really?

12:37.250 --> 12:39.750
I'll show you
when we're
there.

12:39.834 --> 12:42.458
- You're going to the ball?
- Yes.

12:45.458 --> 12:46.667
The roses came?

12:46.750 --> 12:47.750
This morning.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.000
I didn't get mine.

12:51.291 --> 12:52.875
I'm not debuting?

12:54.542 --> 12:55.542
Sorry, Sloane.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.667
Did I get bumped for her?

12:59.750 --> 13:01.792
We don't even know her!

13:05.083 --> 13:06.291
Sloane was new money.

13:06.375 --> 13:08.709
Which made her a bad person?

13:08.792 --> 13:10.750
No, what I mean is
she was expendable so..

13:11.917 --> 13:13.750
Irene cut her out.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.709
For Emma.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.625
So, Sloane had an
axe to grind with Emma

13:18.709 --> 13:20.041
but Emma died at the ball.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.959
Yeah, but Sloane was there.

13:22.041 --> 13:23.875
And she was angry.

13:23.959 --> 13:25.542
Why would she be there?

13:25.625 --> 13:26.583
She wasn't a debutante.

13:26.667 --> 13:29.250
True, but...
I know I saw her.

13:29.333 --> 13:30.291
Any proof of that?

13:30.375 --> 13:32.542
Ask Chip...
if you can find him.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.125
Your best friend.

13:34.208 --> 13:35.583
But why would we believe him?

13:35.667 --> 13:38.375
You probably wouldn't
just like you don't believe
me.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.333
You're right,
Travis, I don't.

13:42.417 --> 13:44.208
Well...join the club.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.709
That's why I have to hire
all these fancy lawyers.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.542
To help the guy
that nobody believes.

13:52.917 --> 13:55.750
Travis points to Sloane.
A girl that got knocked out

13:55.834 --> 13:57.875
of being a deb 'cause
Emma took her place.

13:57.959 --> 14:00.750
Got Sloane's mug shot
from a DUI in '69.

14:00.834 --> 14:03.083
(Valens)
'Comparing it to the
Benevolent Society's photos'

14:03.166 --> 14:04.458
'from the ball.'

14:04.542 --> 14:06.417
This Travis talks
a good game, huh?

14:06.500 --> 14:09.583
Well, smooth, but I still say
lightning doesn't strike
twice.

14:09.667 --> 14:11.542
(Stillman)
'Miller have any luck
tracking the swan ring?'

14:11.625 --> 14:13.250
She put the word out
to every pawnshop

14:13.333 --> 14:14.917
and auction house in Philly.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.291
Remembering a sale from 38 years
ago, that's one long shot.

14:18.375 --> 14:21.250
Here, look at this.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.875
(Valens)
'Ain't that Sloane?'

14:24.333 --> 14:26.375
Staring daggers at Emma.

14:42.542 --> 14:45.333
Feel like I should've polished
my shoes for this neighborhood.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.792
No kidding.
Nice cribs out here.

14:47.875 --> 14:48.875
You're coming to the
Sixers game, right?

14:48.959 --> 14:49.917
Jeffries got tickets?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.458
Who's going
you, me and him?

14:51.542 --> 14:54.458
Well, I invited Miller but
she's got her other thing.

14:55.917 --> 14:57.834
Something to do
with Veronica?

14:57.917 --> 14:59.000
This morning I heard
her
ordering

14:59.083 --> 15:01.667
flowers for Wednesday night.

15:01.750 --> 15:02.834
Sounds special.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.166
Why didn't she just tell us?

15:05.250 --> 15:06.625
'Cause it's none
of our business.

15:08.542 --> 15:12.083
We're coworkers, we should
share our lives with each
other.

15:12.166 --> 15:14.667
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

15:14.750 --> 15:16.667
This is it.

15:26.709 --> 15:30.000
I wanted to be a debutante
more than anything in the
world.

15:30.083 --> 15:32.792
So it must've hurt something
awful when Emma took your place.

15:32.875 --> 15:35.166
Oh, it did.
I thought I'd actually
die.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.125
I could hardly
get out of bed.

15:37.208 --> 15:39.709
Well, you got up
to go to that ball.

15:39.792 --> 15:40.750
Mm-hmm.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.625
Why, Sloane?

15:43.709 --> 15:44.834
For Chip.

15:44.917 --> 15:47.125
But Chip
was Landon's escort.

15:47.208 --> 15:48.333
But they were
just friends.

15:48.417 --> 15:50.458
Chip wanted
me around for after.

15:50.542 --> 15:52.375
If you...get my drift.

15:52.458 --> 15:53.375
I get it.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.667
I was always good for that.

15:55.750 --> 15:59.625
So, you hung around the ball
till he did his escort
duties.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.667
I watched a little,
but I was mostly upstairs

16:01.750 --> 16:03.417
in our hotel room.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.750
So Emma just got a free pass..

16:05.834 --> 16:07.917
...even though
she's in the big white
dress..

16:08.000 --> 16:10.375
'...and you're not?'

16:10.458 --> 16:11.625
I'd lost by that point.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.125
I'd already done
the worst I could.

16:13.208 --> 16:16.166
- And what was that?
- Found something out.

16:16.250 --> 16:17.208
And ran with it.

16:20.291 --> 16:22.834
It may be your night, girls
but please

16:22.917 --> 16:24.583
try to let the boys lead.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.792
Oh, darn it.
I stepped on you again.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.000
I didn't notice.

16:34.083 --> 16:36.542
But, for you,
it's back on one.

16:36.625 --> 16:38.125
Okay.

16:42.834 --> 16:45.291
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

16:45.375 --> 16:47.208
Why are you debuting?

16:47.291 --> 16:49.500
My mother says
it's an
opportunity.

16:49.583 --> 16:52.125
- What do you say?
- It's alright.

16:52.208 --> 16:54.625
Actually, today's
been pretty fun. Why?

16:54.709 --> 16:56.917
I've been watching
you at all the parties.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.667
(Travis)
'You don't seem as
excited as the other girls.'

16:59.750 --> 17:00.959
It's not really my thing.

17:02.208 --> 17:03.458
Like physics.

17:03.542 --> 17:07.125
Well, this is physics.
Everything is physics.

17:09.333 --> 17:12.250
My foot describes a vector..

17:12.333 --> 17:14.166
...with force..

17:14.250 --> 17:16.125
...going in a direction..

17:16.208 --> 17:18.208
Tracing a closed system.

17:18.291 --> 17:21.041
I hadn't really
thought of it that
way.

17:21.125 --> 17:23.125
Oh!

17:23.208 --> 17:25.792
Maybe you two should
find some empty space.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.291
In another building.

17:30.041 --> 17:32.125
I'm sorry.
I'm-I'm hopeless. I'm
afraid--

17:32.208 --> 17:35.208
Don't. Don't look at
them, dance with me.

17:35.291 --> 17:37.250
Dance...with me.

17:55.041 --> 17:57.291
You think Travis
was falling for Emma?

17:57.375 --> 17:59.125
And vice-versa.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.125
Landon wouldn't like that.

18:01.208 --> 18:03.875
When I told her,
she was extremely upset.

18:03.959 --> 18:05.542
(Vera)
'You told her.'

18:05.625 --> 18:08.333
Well, I guess I thought I
could get my place back.

18:08.417 --> 18:09.917
It didn't work.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.709
So how ticked off was Landon?

18:12.792 --> 18:14.667
Ever seen a child
throw a tantrum?

18:14.750 --> 18:15.917
Take something that's theirs

18:16.000 --> 18:18.291
when they're not
used to hearing
no?

18:18.375 --> 18:21.041
- Yeah.
- Travis was Landon's.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.667
Until Emma showed up.

18:23.750 --> 18:28.333
And Landon had gone 18 years
without ever hearing no.

18:40.458 --> 18:42.083
(Rush)
'So what do they call you?'

18:42.166 --> 18:43.333
"Coach?"

18:43.417 --> 18:45.834
My formal title is
Mistress of the Robes

18:45.917 --> 18:49.041
but the one at the end,
she calls me mom.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.375
She looks like you.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.875
Well, hopefully, no one
steals her boyfriend..

18:52.959 --> 18:55.000
'...like Emma stole yours.'

18:56.375 --> 18:58.417
- Excuse me?
- Emma Vine?

18:58.500 --> 19:01.041
Travis Whitman? 1968.

19:01.125 --> 19:02.583
(Rush)
'Sloane said they
were getting close'

19:02.667 --> 19:05.375
and that you didn't like it.

19:05.458 --> 19:06.709
That was a long time ago.

19:06.792 --> 19:09.041
So was the murder
we're working.

19:12.959 --> 19:16.291
Sloane told me what she'd seen
at dance practice

19:16.375 --> 19:17.667
between those two.

19:17.750 --> 19:18.959
And you get angry.

19:19.041 --> 19:21.709
A lady doesn't get angry.

19:21.792 --> 19:25.542
Although, sometimes what
she does instead is worse.

19:31.917 --> 19:33.375
Okay, we'll see
you all tomorrow

19:33.458 --> 19:36.333
at the hotel,
no later than 6 o'clock.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.917
Couldn't your father
make it, dear?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.291
This is the last rehearsal.

19:42.375 --> 19:44.166
He had to fly down
to Cape Canaveral.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.875
He's coming back tonight.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.500
You know how much
we're all looking forward

19:47.583 --> 19:49.625
'to seeing
you bow to him.'

19:52.000 --> 19:53.417
Emma, do you need a ride home?

19:53.500 --> 19:54.792
I was going to
catch the bus.

19:54.875 --> 19:55.917
In that?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.917
I have street
clothes and a
book.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.083
- What are you reading?
- Feynman's lectures.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.667
On physics?
Impressive.

20:02.750 --> 20:05.542
How about I get the car and
I'll
meet you two girls out front.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.625
Travis has that book.

20:10.709 --> 20:11.750
Is it his?

20:11.834 --> 20:14.041
We were talking
about it, so..

20:16.000 --> 20:17.792
Your bow is really
graceful, Landon.

20:17.875 --> 20:20.625
I've been practicing
it my whole life.

20:20.709 --> 20:23.458
- Nervous about tomorrow?
- A little.

20:23.542 --> 20:26.125
But I hear there's this
acoustic
anomaly in the ballroom.

20:26.208 --> 20:28.709
That Travis said
he was going to show you.

20:30.959 --> 20:33.417
There's something about
Travis you don't know.

20:35.417 --> 20:36.667
He's Jewish.

20:38.041 --> 20:39.959
- He is?
- 'He hides it well.'

20:40.917 --> 20:42.667
His whole family does.

20:42.750 --> 20:44.750
But that's the dirty
little Whitman secret.

20:48.750 --> 20:50.875
But I thought
Jews
weren't allowed.

20:55.208 --> 20:58.417
I guess it was like...
spitting on your food

20:58.500 --> 21:00.458
before someone
else could take it.

21:00.542 --> 21:02.834
That was your way
of trying to keep Travis.

21:02.917 --> 21:04.625
I loved him.

21:04.709 --> 21:07.208
Even though I could
see that he liked
Emma.

21:07.291 --> 21:09.667
So what would've happened
if Travis's secret got
around?

21:11.125 --> 21:13.166
Would've been the
end of him at the club.

21:13.250 --> 21:16.250
- Him, his whole family.
- Socially?

21:16.333 --> 21:19.417
People had a lot of,
um, business connections

21:19.500 --> 21:20.917
through there, too.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.834
And they would've lost
them
because they were Jewish.

21:23.917 --> 21:25.625
I'm telling you how it was..

21:27.375 --> 21:29.333
...not how I
thought it should
be.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.208
Excuse me.

21:35.959 --> 21:37.208
'So..'

21:37.291 --> 21:40.875
...Travis has got a
secret and Emma knows it.

21:40.959 --> 21:44.166
Hm. Sounds like the escort
had motive, after all.

21:54.166 --> 21:55.959
Really pushing
that sale, huh, Travis?

21:57.667 --> 22:00.250
Guess you got hungry
lawyers to feed, huh?

22:01.333 --> 22:03.208
Why are you back here?

22:03.291 --> 22:05.125
Because you said
you barely knew Emma

22:05.208 --> 22:06.792
when really you were
falling for her.

22:08.041 --> 22:09.291
It's no
reason
to kill her.

22:09.375 --> 22:10.250
No.

22:10.333 --> 22:11.709
There is a another reason.

22:11.792 --> 22:14.291
Well, you seem
to know more than I
do.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.917
Your family secret.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.208
The one you told Landon.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.208
Our secret.

22:22.291 --> 22:25.250
Well, your name, Weissman.

22:25.333 --> 22:28.709
In 1955, your family
changed it to Whitman

22:28.792 --> 22:30.667
because back then,
there was only so
high

22:30.750 --> 22:33.000
a Jewish
family
could climb.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.667
Our name was
changed, it's true.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.041
And Emma found out.

22:38.125 --> 22:39.834
- Threatened to expose you.
- No.

22:39.917 --> 22:42.583
Now, I don't need any
pictures
to read you, Travis.

22:42.667 --> 22:45.458
You're practical, you need
cash.
You sell some paintings.

22:45.542 --> 22:47.375
- You need to guard a secret--
- It wasn't like that.

22:47.458 --> 22:49.041
There were no threats.

22:50.750 --> 22:52.458
Seemed like we both
just came clean.

23:04.458 --> 23:06.917
- I rang the bell, but--
- I just came out to..

23:08.166 --> 23:10.959
I'm trying to see
Saturn's rings.

23:11.041 --> 23:14.166
Ah. You left this
at the club.

23:14.250 --> 23:18.083
Oh! I took it off
to try on those gloves.

23:19.542 --> 23:23.583
This ring,
it's...it's
special to me.

23:23.667 --> 23:25.583
I found it before you left.

23:25.667 --> 23:28.959
Tried to flag you down but
I think you were avoiding me.

23:32.959 --> 23:34.458
Landon told me
something about
you.

23:36.083 --> 23:37.500
Your family..

23:37.583 --> 23:40.417
That we're Jewish.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.500
- Is that a problem?
- No.

23:44.709 --> 23:46.375
But I wonder why
you hang around with
people

23:46.458 --> 23:48.583
who don't like
who you really
are.

23:48.667 --> 23:50.500
Why do you?

23:50.583 --> 23:51.834
Right.

23:54.583 --> 23:57.041
'Cause I'm
keeping
a secret, too.

23:59.834 --> 24:03.166
My dad got pulled
from the moon shot yesterday.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.625
My mom won't let me
tell anyone.

24:05.709 --> 24:07.792
She wants us
to keep up appearances.

24:07.875 --> 24:09.625
Like my family.

24:09.709 --> 24:12.125
Appearances are the only thing
that matters to these people.

24:12.208 --> 24:13.542
You already knew that.

24:15.417 --> 24:17.458
I guess I've been
trying not to
notice.

24:17.542 --> 24:19.417
For your mother?

24:22.333 --> 24:24.959
More because I don't want
to stop being around you.

24:37.583 --> 24:39.208
Did Landon know
this was going on?

24:39.291 --> 24:41.500
No, we were going
to deal with it after the
ball.

24:42.667 --> 24:44.583
Then Emma died.

24:44.667 --> 24:46.125
So why not
tell me this
before?

24:46.208 --> 24:47.625
(Travis)
'You didn't want to hear
it.'

24:47.709 --> 24:50.709
You just wanted me to hold out
my hands for the cuffs..

24:50.792 --> 24:52.542
...like everybody
else in this city.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.875
Come on, Travis,
you expect people to believe

24:55.959 --> 24:57.458
two women in
your life end up dead

24:57.542 --> 24:59.542
at the bottom of the stairs
and that's just chance?

24:59.625 --> 25:03.583
It sounds unbelievable,
but it's what happened.

25:03.667 --> 25:04.917
Right.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Well, I had a piece
of news today.

25:07.083 --> 25:10.083
Second autopsy shows
Sadie did have a seizure

25:10.166 --> 25:12.500
moments before she fell,
like I thought.

25:14.083 --> 25:16.583
Is that according to a doctor
you're paying to testify?

25:16.667 --> 25:18.792
No, it's according
to your medical examiner.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.750
So maybe this Travis
isn't such a monster.

25:23.834 --> 25:25.583
'Maybe terrible
coincidences can happen.'

25:25.667 --> 25:26.875
I'll be in touch.

25:26.959 --> 25:30.083
But my lawyer says the
charges may be dropped.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.875
But it must be a mistake.

25:38.542 --> 25:39.500
I'm sorry.

25:39.583 --> 25:41.750
The ME's report
was pretty clear

25:41.834 --> 25:43.375
about his wife's seizure.

25:43.458 --> 25:46.583
But I know he killed Emma.
I know it.

25:48.333 --> 25:52.125
I spent 38 years not knowing,
and then I opened that paper.

25:52.208 --> 25:54.125
I can't walk away now.

25:57.250 --> 25:59.041
You have children?

25:59.125 --> 26:00.166
A daughter.

26:00.250 --> 26:01.625
You know, right?

26:01.709 --> 26:03.959
You know in your heart
when something happens

26:04.041 --> 26:05.125
'to them, don't you?'

26:07.291 --> 26:08.125
Yeah.

26:08.208 --> 26:11.458
Please...don't drop her case.

26:14.959 --> 26:18.250
Lillian, if we do continue,
you have to be honest with us.

26:19.041 --> 26:20.333
Haven't I been?

26:20.417 --> 26:22.500
You didn't tell us
about your husband.

26:22.583 --> 26:24.333
That he couldn't
go to the ball.

26:24.417 --> 26:25.625
No.

26:25.709 --> 26:28.959
The day before the ball,
he was in the hospital.

26:29.041 --> 26:29.917
Yes.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.667
So what was your plan?

26:31.750 --> 26:34.500
I know you wanted Emma
to debut more than anything.

26:34.583 --> 26:36.500
What could we do?

26:36.583 --> 26:40.417
On the day of the ball,
we went to Irene to tell
her.

26:41.750 --> 26:44.792
I frankly thought
we'd be kicked
out.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.792
But you weren't.

26:46.875 --> 26:49.792
No, because instead,
we found Matthew..

26:50.917 --> 26:52.166
...and he was our angel.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.375
(Matthew)
'Hello, ladies.'

26:55.458 --> 26:57.417
Are you excited
about tonight?

26:57.500 --> 26:58.875
I'm afraid
that's
why we're
here.

26:58.959 --> 27:01.000
We won't be coming.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.500
What?

27:02.583 --> 27:04.959
Timothy's not well.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.208
He's in the hospital.

27:08.083 --> 27:09.709
- Lillian--
- He's all right.

27:09.792 --> 27:12.041
But he's not
going to the
moon.

27:12.125 --> 27:15.208
Honestly, I don't know
what's gonna happen to
him.

27:15.291 --> 27:17.500
Mom, he's strong.

27:17.583 --> 27:19.875
I'm sure Emma's right.

27:19.959 --> 27:21.709
Anyhow, I hate
to
embarrass Irene

27:21.792 --> 27:24.458
but without her father,
Emma won't be able to
debut.

27:25.625 --> 27:27.750
Emma could make her bow to me.

27:27.834 --> 27:29.917
- Oh, no, we couldn't.
- 'Why not?'

27:30.000 --> 27:33.083
I'd be proud to present
the first woman astronaut.

27:33.166 --> 27:35.333
But, dad, aren't
we walking together?

27:35.417 --> 27:37.000
I could walk
with you both.

27:37.083 --> 27:39.542
No. If her father can't
come, she shouldn't either.

27:39.625 --> 27:40.917
Landon, don't
be like that.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.542
Dad, this is for you and me.

27:43.625 --> 27:45.709
She's not
your daughter, I am.

27:45.792 --> 27:48.834
- Landon, I would never--
- I wish you'd never shown up.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.542
Because you're
ruining everything!

27:56.500 --> 27:59.250
Sounds like Landon
bared her claws.

27:59.333 --> 28:00.417
She was just upset.

28:02.083 --> 28:03.500
I wonder how upset.

28:05.208 --> 28:08.000
Lillian, did Matthew
have a special reason

28:08.083 --> 28:09.333
for helping you?

28:10.542 --> 28:13.417
We'd known each
other growing up.

28:16.583 --> 28:21.291
My mother and I used
to clean his family's house.

28:21.375 --> 28:24.333
That's why it meant so much to
you that Emma was a debutante.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.583
That you'd grown up
your whole life

28:27.667 --> 28:30.375
with your face pressed
against the glass.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.417
I didn't envy
the material
things.

28:35.125 --> 28:39.000
I envied...how safe they were.

28:39.083 --> 28:40.333
How protected.

28:40.417 --> 28:42.125
You wanted that
for your daughter.

28:42.208 --> 28:44.208
Maybe I thought
it was possible

28:44.291 --> 28:45.625
because I grew up
with Matthew.

28:46.917 --> 28:48.291
He made you feel
like you belonged.

28:49.792 --> 28:52.625
Around everyone else,
we were what we were.

28:53.875 --> 28:57.291
By ourselves,
we were
friends.

29:04.834 --> 29:07.083
I can't wait until I'm reading
the sports page again

29:07.166 --> 29:09.125
instead of society news.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.333
Hear that.

29:10.417 --> 29:13.667
Robes, gloves, bows, gowns.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.709
The Sixers game
can't come quick enough.

29:15.792 --> 29:17.834
Does anyone know
where Quaker Hall is?

29:17.917 --> 29:20.208
- Near the sports complex.
- Off of south?

29:20.291 --> 29:21.834
- Mm.
- Thanks.

29:23.166 --> 29:24.250
Goodnight, guys.

29:24.333 --> 29:25.875
- Night.
- Night.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.166
Mm-hmm.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.583
What?

29:31.667 --> 29:33.875
Bet you that's where she's
going
with her date tomorrow.

29:33.959 --> 29:35.583
And that has nothing
to do with us.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.375
Don't even think it, man.

29:38.458 --> 29:40.750
Well, look at this.

29:41.834 --> 29:43.625
What do you got?

29:43.709 --> 29:47.291
(Jeffries)
'Landon's daughter
in this year's crop of
debs.'

29:47.375 --> 29:48.500
Yeah?

29:48.583 --> 29:50.583
Look at her hand.

29:53.333 --> 29:56.250
She's wearing Emma's ring.

30:00.959 --> 30:02.792
That ring belongs
to my daughter.

30:02.875 --> 30:04.875
It belongs to Emma Vine.

30:04.959 --> 30:06.542
She wore it the day she died.

30:06.625 --> 30:09.333
It came from
my father's
family.

30:09.417 --> 30:12.166
We know the problem you had with
your dad reaching out to Emma.

30:12.250 --> 30:13.458
That's immaterial.

30:13.542 --> 30:16.041
We also know
that your boyfriend's eye

30:16.125 --> 30:17.709
was wandering toward her.

30:17.792 --> 30:19.917
Put that together,
I can see you deciding

30:20.000 --> 30:21.625
she needs a trip
down the stairs.

30:21.709 --> 30:24.208
(Miller)
'You didn't think
it would kill her.'

30:24.291 --> 30:26.542
I have been open
and helpful with
you.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.625
Not really, Landon.

30:31.917 --> 30:33.625
Any secrets I kept..

30:33.709 --> 30:35.875
...didn't have anything
to do with Emma's death.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.583
(Jeffries)
'Secrets, huh?'

30:37.667 --> 30:39.625
(Miller)
'Unless you want
your daughter to debut
tonight'

30:39.709 --> 30:42.291
while you're
sitting in a jail cell

30:42.375 --> 30:44.000
better start dishin'.

30:48.875 --> 30:51.625
What my father
said to Emma upset me.

30:51.709 --> 30:53.583
Is that surprising?

30:53.667 --> 30:55.959
He was my father.

30:56.041 --> 30:57.500
I didn't want to share.

30:57.583 --> 30:59.041
So what'd you do about it?

31:00.166 --> 31:01.291
Went crying to my friends.

31:02.792 --> 31:04.709
Said they had a way
to cheer me up.

31:07.542 --> 31:09.750
Sure you don't want the acid?

31:09.834 --> 31:11.083
Sloane's digging it.

31:11.166 --> 31:12.792
I have to bow
in 20 minutes.

31:12.875 --> 31:15.667
How many debs does it take
to change a light bulb?

31:15.750 --> 31:18.083
I think this
ball is all in my head.

31:18.166 --> 31:21.583
Four. Three to complain,
one to tell the maid to do
it.

31:21.667 --> 31:25.250
No, seriously, I can feel
the ballroom...here.

31:26.375 --> 31:27.417
Emma.

31:28.417 --> 31:30.375
Sorry, Fishtown,
private party.

31:30.458 --> 31:32.458
Landon, I heard
you came up here.

31:32.542 --> 31:34.041
Yes, to get away from you.

31:34.125 --> 31:36.000
'I'll say no
to your dad if you want.'

31:36.083 --> 31:40.166
No to walking with him
or to being his new
daughter?

31:40.250 --> 31:41.667
You're his daughter.
He loves you.

31:41.750 --> 31:44.959
How would you know?
<i>you.</i>

31:45.041 --> 31:47.125
He's never been
proud
of me for anything.

31:47.208 --> 31:49.000
'We have nothing in common.'

31:49.083 --> 31:50.750
There's just this.

31:50.834 --> 31:53.750
And I can't cry.
I'm wearing mascara.

31:53.834 --> 31:57.041
- Landon--
- Don't. Just don't.

31:57.125 --> 32:00.583
How many Jews does it take
to change a light bulb?

32:02.750 --> 32:05.083
Jews are too cheap
to change a light bulb.

32:05.166 --> 32:06.417
They'd rather sit in the dark.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.667
A few minutes later
we all went downstairs.

32:25.750 --> 32:26.834
(Miller)
'Travis was with you?'

32:28.125 --> 32:30.792
He, uh, slipped
off
to find Emma.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.959
Right before
the bows started?

32:35.750 --> 32:37.375
That's when
she got killed.

32:38.834 --> 32:40.125
You should have told us,
Landon.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.333
He's a friend.

32:43.792 --> 32:45.750
We know him.

32:48.125 --> 32:49.542
Guess who put two lots
of jewelry

32:49.625 --> 32:51.125
up for auction on the quiet.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.667
Swan ring
among the pieces.

33:01.792 --> 33:05.000
Dug through a lot of
baubles to find this,
Travis.

33:05.083 --> 33:07.417
(Valens)
'So you had Emma's ring.'

33:07.500 --> 33:09.750
Got an explanation
to go with it?

33:09.834 --> 33:12.625
It's a ring.
There's probably a
thousand.

33:14.208 --> 33:16.000
No.

33:16.083 --> 33:17.333
Just two.

33:17.417 --> 33:19.959
Landon's
grandfather had 'em made.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.333
One for his daughter

33:21.417 --> 33:25.125
and one for the daughter of
his
housekeeper, Lillian.

33:25.208 --> 33:27.583
They're the girls'
Christmas presents.

33:27.667 --> 33:30.000
The year they turned 18.

33:30.083 --> 33:31.125
I know.

33:32.333 --> 33:35.083
Why'd you take
Emma's ring, Travis?

33:35.166 --> 33:37.166
Little souvenir
from your first murder?

33:37.250 --> 33:38.792
- 'No.'
- No?

33:41.500 --> 33:42.875
I loved her.

33:42.959 --> 33:44.667
Funny, 'cause the
first time we asked

33:44.750 --> 33:46.417
you said
you hardly knew her.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.917
Now you hock her
ring to free up some cash.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.041
Doesn't sound much
like love to me.

33:53.458 --> 33:56.291
If that ring was
in there, it was a
mistake.

33:56.375 --> 33:57.834
It was the only
piece of Emma I
had.

33:57.917 --> 34:00.917
Because it was the only
piece of her you could take.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.375
(Rush)
'You think
you see into people?'

34:03.458 --> 34:05.417
She saw into you.

34:05.500 --> 34:09.625
The pleaser, the guy who's
everything to everyone.

34:09.709 --> 34:11.625
The guy who's
really nothing at all.

34:11.709 --> 34:14.625
How'd it make
you feel, Travis

34:14.709 --> 34:16.792
knowing you were a fraud?

34:16.875 --> 34:18.542
Knowing Emma knew, too?

34:22.291 --> 34:24.333
Emma was like a comet.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.083
She just lit up everything.

34:29.792 --> 34:31.875
I was trying to change.

34:32.709 --> 34:33.750
But you couldn't.

34:35.125 --> 34:36.291
Not fast enough.

34:38.083 --> 34:39.542
She was up there
in the sky.

34:41.041 --> 34:44.291
But I was just left
there
standing on the
ground.

35:03.709 --> 35:05.625
That's some moon.

35:05.709 --> 35:07.250
Yes.

35:08.291 --> 35:11.166
There's the Sea
of Tranquility.

35:11.250 --> 35:12.667
It's beautiful.

35:12.750 --> 35:15.375
When I was
little,
I used to think

35:15.458 --> 35:17.542
I'd have a house on the moon.

35:17.625 --> 35:20.333
My mom said I'd spend
all of my time flying

35:20.417 --> 35:21.834
just to go there and back.

35:21.917 --> 35:24.417
[chuckles]
I said it was fine with
me.

35:25.709 --> 35:27.750
Emma...
back there with Chip--

35:27.834 --> 35:29.333
It's okay.

35:29.417 --> 35:31.792
- I just laughed..
- Because you're going along.

35:31.875 --> 35:33.000
For your family.

35:33.083 --> 35:35.000
- I understand.
- No, Emma.

35:35.083 --> 35:36.792
It was wrong.

35:36.875 --> 35:39.208
I know it.

35:39.291 --> 35:40.583
I know it because of you.

35:45.208 --> 35:47.875
That's a waltz.

35:47.959 --> 35:50.417
I know that
because of
you.

35:50.500 --> 35:51.667
So dance with me.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.000
The bows
will
start soon.

35:53.083 --> 35:54.375
Not yet.

36:07.291 --> 36:09.542
You don't want me, Travis.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.166
You'll find someone else.

36:11.250 --> 36:13.166
No.

36:13.250 --> 36:14.917
Someone who fits in here.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.250
You'll teach her to dance.

36:16.333 --> 36:18.041
I want you.

36:18.125 --> 36:21.250
- It can't be me.
- Why not?

36:21.333 --> 36:25.000
I can't trade who I am
to get what I want.

36:25.083 --> 36:26.291
But I'm doing all
this for my family.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.000
No, you're doing
this for you.

36:28.083 --> 36:31.166
Emma, you know how
I really feel.

36:31.250 --> 36:32.583
You didn't say
anything
upstairs

36:32.667 --> 36:34.417
because you're never
going to say
anything.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.458
Are you
calling me a liar?

36:36.542 --> 36:37.917
I..

36:38.000 --> 36:41.125
...I just don't
want
to be like that.

36:41.208 --> 36:43.500
Like me, you mean?

36:44.917 --> 36:46.041
Say it!

36:46.125 --> 36:48.083
Say it if you mean it!

36:48.166 --> 36:49.917
Like you.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.709
I don't want
to be like
you.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.792
Emma.

37:15.875 --> 37:17.417
(male #1)
'Introducing Miss..'

37:19.875 --> 37:21.625

'No.'
