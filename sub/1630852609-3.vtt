WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.237
This is not
RuPaul's Best Friend Race.

00:03.237 --> 00:04.771
I feel very attacked!

00:04.771 --> 00:06.607
If you don't have star quality,

00:06.607 --> 00:07.841
get the fuck out of here.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.544
Oh, my God.

00:10.544 --> 00:13.447
RuPaul: This is Untucked,

00:13.447 --> 00:15.148
backstage
at the competition

00:15.148 --> 00:18.352
to become America's
next drag superstar.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.120
Girl, if you're
not watching Untucked,

00:20.120 --> 00:22.623
you're only getting
half the story.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.525
Director: That's a break
on the main stage.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.927
All cameras re-po.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.830
RuPaul: Welcome, ladies.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.698
I've made some decisions.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.600
Alyssa Hunter,
Bosco,

00:33.600 --> 00:35.969
Kerri Colby,
Kornbread,

00:35.969 --> 00:37.905
Daya Betty,
DeJa Skye,

00:37.905 --> 00:40.841
Jasmine Kennedie,
Lady Camden...

00:40.841 --> 00:42.142
You are safe.

00:42.142 --> 00:43.510
You may leave the stage.

00:48.315 --> 00:51.218
The Ball challenge
was a challenge

00:51.218 --> 00:52.686
that I thought
I would excel at.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.254
The fact that I was just safe

00:54.254 --> 00:56.523
makes me pissed at myself.

00:56.523 --> 00:59.026
Maybe I'm not
as good of a sewer

00:59.026 --> 01:00.594
as I thought I was.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.930
I feel mad.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.464
I wanted to win the challenge.

01:04.464 --> 01:07.768
I think I am the most couture
right now here

01:07.768 --> 01:09.403
for all these bitches.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.072
It doesn't feel amazing
that I'm safe

01:12.072 --> 01:13.707
on a sewing challenge

01:13.707 --> 01:15.709
because I'm a seamstress.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.345
But after being
in the bottom two,

01:18.345 --> 01:20.047
I'm fine with it.

01:21.581 --> 01:22.749
All cameras up.

01:22.749 --> 01:23.850
Copy that. Here we go.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.719
We got the queens walking.
[clack]

01:27.587 --> 01:28.755
Okay.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.158
Meow.

01:31.158 --> 01:33.593
-We're safe. We're safe.
-Libations.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.697
The first Untucked with all
of our Season 14 sisters.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.365
-Yay!
-Yay!

01:38.365 --> 01:39.666
Whatever.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.368
How y'all feeling?

01:41.368 --> 01:44.004
Alyssa, can you open this?

01:44.004 --> 01:45.472
First ball.

01:45.472 --> 01:48.075
-Gimme some tip, bitch.
-Ooh!

01:48.075 --> 01:49.209
I'll give you more
than just the tip, baby.

01:49.209 --> 01:50.277
Oh!

01:50.277 --> 01:52.212
Is anyone kind of
in their feelings?

01:52.212 --> 01:54.081
I'm not bitter--
well, I am bitter.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.649
-[laughs]
-I'm pissed.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.850
I'm pissed because of this.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.885
Because this
didn't get praised.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.654
-"Because of this."
-What is that, bitch?

02:00.654 --> 02:02.723
It just felt like
I didn't make top.

02:02.723 --> 02:06.159
Jasmine is emotional
because she thought

02:06.159 --> 02:08.628
she was going to land
in the top.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.030
But, girl, look around.

02:10.030 --> 02:13.166
There were people that had
much better garments than you,

02:13.166 --> 02:16.503
so build a bridge
and get over it.

02:16.503 --> 02:18.338
The wedding part
was a little tricky

02:18.338 --> 02:19.539
because some of us,

02:19.539 --> 02:21.541
we looked like
we're going to a beauty pageant.

02:21.541 --> 02:22.642
Well, some of us.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.812
Alyssa, how are you feeling?

02:25.812 --> 02:27.547
I am a little bit disappointed.

02:27.547 --> 02:28.648
-I'm gonna be honest.
-Yeah.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.250
Because before
I entered Drag Race,

02:30.250 --> 02:32.185
I was, oh,
I literally need to win,

02:32.185 --> 02:33.553
you know, the Ball challenge.

02:33.553 --> 02:35.122
This is amazing.

02:35.122 --> 02:36.923
When RuPaul said "You're safe,"

02:36.923 --> 02:38.925
literally my face,
it was, fuck.

02:38.925 --> 02:40.260
Is this really happening?

02:40.260 --> 02:42.729
Like, I'm here
to win challenge,

02:42.729 --> 02:44.765
and last week,
I was in the bottom three.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.333
That's not a position
that I love it.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.503
So this week, I just
put myself together

02:49.503 --> 02:50.771
and I was, Alyssa,

02:50.771 --> 02:52.572
this is your time
to redeem yourself

02:52.572 --> 02:53.940
and be in the top.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.510
And I was pretty confident
that I would be in the top.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.644
It sucks.

02:57.644 --> 03:01.181
I come from
a beauty pageant background,

03:01.181 --> 03:03.850
I am a runway coach.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.085
I wanted to win the challenge.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.720
You, Lady Camden,

03:06.720 --> 03:08.422
like, I'm surprised
you're not in the top.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.090
I think that was a part of me
that was, like,

03:10.090 --> 03:12.125
oh, my God, it would be
really fucking sick

03:12.125 --> 03:13.427
to be, like, in the top.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.928
But then I also realize, like,

03:14.928 --> 03:15.929
that sewing's
not my thing, man.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.732
What the hell do you mean
sewing's not your thing?

03:18.732 --> 03:20.634
You did a great job.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.035
I faked it really well.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.370
So part of me was, like,

03:23.370 --> 03:25.005
that would have been
really fucking cool.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.273
And then when she said safe,

03:26.273 --> 03:28.108
I was, like, disappointed.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.543
But to be fair,
I don't think

03:29.543 --> 03:32.679
my red or white were anything
to really write home about.

03:32.679 --> 03:35.182
I think the part that
I'm the most bummed about

03:35.182 --> 03:37.484
is, like, when you're safe,
which is great,

03:37.484 --> 03:40.387
you don't get to hear
any feedback.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.988
I wanted to know
what they thought

03:41.988 --> 03:42.989
we could have done better.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.925
I think these girls
are ridiculous.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.193
You are safe.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.161
You're here to see
another week.

03:48.161 --> 03:51.164
I don't know why
you are so butt hurt about it.

03:51.164 --> 03:54.134
-I went home last week.
-Right.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.869
How you feel
that you coming back?

03:55.869 --> 03:57.437
Baby, you're
in the game again.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.606
I feel so much better,
you guys.

03:59.606 --> 04:03.510
Literally, last week
was so disheartening to me.

04:03.510 --> 04:06.313
Me and her were crying
when they sent you home.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.415
Bitch, I was crying
after I got sent home.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.717
I was feeling really confident

04:10.717 --> 04:12.119
just because I do sew.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.687
Like, that's what I do.

04:13.687 --> 04:17.090
But I'll take it,
because last week, you know,

04:17.090 --> 04:19.159
I was not in this situation,

04:19.159 --> 04:20.660
and it fucked me up.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.430
And seeing you for the first
time with your drag aesthetic,

04:23.430 --> 04:25.765
I think you need to be here
in this competition.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.335
You give a very,
like, animated element

04:28.335 --> 04:30.237
that I think is so well done.

04:30.237 --> 04:33.106
You saying that
really means something to me,

04:33.106 --> 04:35.542
so I really appreciate that
coming from you.

04:35.542 --> 04:36.843
And I'm about to cry.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.245
-Again.
-We got you.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.312
No, but seriously, you guys,

04:39.312 --> 04:41.014
I'm so happy to be here.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.349
I don't think, like,

04:42.349 --> 04:43.717
this competition was ready
for you to go yet.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.318
And that is why I'm here.

04:45.318 --> 04:48.221
And I plan on staying
a lot longer,

04:48.221 --> 04:50.724
so fuck yeah.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.492
It's great that you
get to show more of a bitch.

04:52.492 --> 04:53.927
When they said two more people,

04:53.927 --> 04:54.928
I said, girl,
are y'all playing with me?

04:56.196 --> 04:58.298
Yeah, I was definitely, like,

04:58.298 --> 04:59.833
we just had six new queens.

04:59.833 --> 05:00.867
They were just, like,

05:00.867 --> 05:02.169
okay, just met
the six other ho's,

05:02.169 --> 05:03.803
and now there's two
back in the game.

05:03.803 --> 05:04.838
and I thought, like,

05:04.838 --> 05:05.906
I'd at least
jumped over the hurdle

05:05.906 --> 05:07.240
of not being first out.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.844
It was not easy
to get to where we were

05:10.844 --> 05:12.012
to have the six.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.413
So when the two girls
walking out,

05:13.413 --> 05:14.781
I was, like, oh, God,
here we go back to square one.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.153
The vibe is...awkward.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.989
I see some of the girls
eyeballing me.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.258
I can tell
they're a little pissed.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.127
So that's intimidating as hell.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.362
Did I feel some type of way
when y'all walked up in here?

05:29.362 --> 05:32.065
Any bitch in a competition
for $100.000

05:32.065 --> 05:33.400
that feel like
they are the best

05:33.400 --> 05:35.035
that are trying
to knock ho's down

05:35.035 --> 05:36.703
should feel some kind of way.

05:36.703 --> 05:39.539
I was, like,
it's 14 people again.

05:39.539 --> 05:40.574
-Yeah.
-We're in a competition.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.775
And if any
of these bitches say

05:41.775 --> 05:43.443
that they did even feel
a little inkling

05:43.443 --> 05:44.844
or a twist in their spirit,

05:44.844 --> 05:46.346
that there were two more
people in the competition,

05:46.346 --> 05:47.914
they fucking lying.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.953
I felt that energy from you,
and it kind of like--

05:52.953 --> 05:54.354
you know, it freaks me out
a little bit.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.423
But you here now.

05:56.423 --> 05:59.025
I can't change that
'cause my name ain't RuPaul.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.727
So I'm just, like,
now that you here,

06:00.727 --> 06:02.229
I'm not gonna make you feel like
you don't deserve to be here.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.231
Because if I deserve
to be here,

06:04.231 --> 06:05.265
all you ho's
deserve to be here.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.266
It would never be that.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.168
Period.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.503
For this particular ball,
the real shit,

06:10.503 --> 06:11.738
girl, when she said safe,

06:11.738 --> 06:13.506
I was the happiest ho
on the planet.

06:13.506 --> 06:15.075
'Cause, bitch,
I'm not no seamstress.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.876
Did I make a lot
of this garment? Yes.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.912
Did I get help?
Abso-fucking-lutely.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.480
I am not that kind if girl
that's gonna sit here

06:20.480 --> 06:21.982
and just be, like,
yes, Miss Thing, I made it.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.617
'Cause I would have called
you out if you did. [laughs]

06:23.617 --> 06:25.952
Bitch--never mind.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.320
Fuck. No, fuck,
take credit, girl.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.989
Oh, child.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.824
DeJa, you helped Jasmine.

06:30.824 --> 06:31.958
You helped her.
Y'all happy now?

06:31.958 --> 06:33.593
I was getting
to that goddamn point,

06:33.593 --> 06:34.828
but never mind, ho.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.596
[all laugh]

06:36.596 --> 06:39.799
Kornbread, you are going to be
very big competition this year.

06:39.799 --> 06:42.836
Baby, when you walked
into this werkroom,

06:42.836 --> 06:44.604
I saw you in the final four.

06:44.604 --> 06:46.840
I really appreciate that,
and, girl, I hope that's true.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.975
-[laughs]
-My mindset?

06:48.975 --> 06:51.645
I don't worry about nothin'
none of y'all are doing.

06:51.645 --> 06:54.014
If I would have made
my garment like this

06:54.014 --> 06:56.883
and then looked at any
of y'all's moments--

06:56.883 --> 06:58.985
except Kerri's--
any of y'all moments--

06:58.985 --> 07:03.356
[all laugh]

07:03.356 --> 07:05.392
I would never compare myself,

07:05.392 --> 07:07.494
because it does not change
your skill level.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.129
Yeah.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.330
So, Miss Kerri, how you feeling?

07:10.330 --> 07:11.931
Honestly, this was the challenge

07:11.931 --> 07:15.235
that I was the most, like,
uncomfortable with,

07:15.235 --> 07:18.238
because I have never
sewed nothing before.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.674
You've overcome your biggest
fear in this competition,

07:20.674 --> 07:23.510
which was the one thing that
you're not the greatest at.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.978
-Mm-hmm.
-Like, writing lyrics,

07:24.978 --> 07:27.113
I know I'm gonna need help
from y'all girls.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.050
Which is so weird,
because you talk nonstop.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.786
[all laugh]

07:32.786 --> 07:35.689
With maturity,
there's social cues

07:35.689 --> 07:37.057
that you pick up on,

07:37.057 --> 07:41.194
and I don't think Jasmine's
quite developed those yet,

07:41.194 --> 07:44.397
so she doesn't really know
when to stop talking.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.067
So who is in the top
and who is in the bottom?

07:49.169 --> 07:50.737
My homegirl June
is in the bottom.

07:50.737 --> 07:53.340
I think her zebra look
was the worst.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.642
What? Oh, uh-uh.

07:55.642 --> 07:59.779
Fuck you.
Drink your shit, bitch.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.082
Even though
I love June's outfit,

08:02.082 --> 08:04.050
I think it's gonna be
Maddy and June.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.452
-Yeah, you think so?
-I think Miss Maddy.

08:05.452 --> 08:07.987
I just wanna put everybody
in the bottom, so whatever.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.222
Here's the thing.

08:09.222 --> 08:12.058
I will say that you two
are very distinct and very boom.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.727
I'm just gonna say it.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.665
I can see it kind of coming off
the wrong way, so--

08:18.665 --> 08:21.634
Also it's like--I think
this happens with pageantry.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.002
If someone's asking our opinion,

08:23.002 --> 08:26.005
we're just very
to the point with it.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.742
Where I'm from, there's
literally pageant girls

08:28.742 --> 08:31.211
and then, like, underground,
a little rough around the edges,

08:31.211 --> 08:32.779
which is more where I fit in.

08:32.779 --> 08:35.882
So a lot of the times, we get
this weird rep from them,

08:35.882 --> 08:37.717
and we're always
kind of put down.

08:37.717 --> 08:41.688
And sometimes in pageantry,
like, oh, you're pageant,

08:41.688 --> 08:42.889
so you are, like, bitchy,

08:42.889 --> 08:45.258
you are nah, nah, nah, nah.
But, no.

08:45.258 --> 08:48.161
When you know me
as a person,

08:48.161 --> 08:49.462
I am a good person.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.531
We're not saying you're not.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.534
No, no, no, no, no.
But just to know,

08:54.534 --> 08:56.136
I hate when the people
call me, like,

08:56.136 --> 08:57.537
oh, you're a pageant queen.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.339
No, bitch, I'm more than that.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.907
Okay, can I clarify something?

09:00.907 --> 09:03.643
Where I'm from,
it's, like, one or the other.

09:03.643 --> 09:08.047
It's, like, I have always
had to defend my type.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.716
Whew.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.050
We need to respect, like,

09:11.050 --> 09:13.153
if you're different than I am,
like, just respect that.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.488
Because drag
is everything, bitch.

09:15.488 --> 09:17.023
Like, we can do everything.

09:17.023 --> 09:19.125
-Anything you want, yeah.
-Always.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.429
Ooh, girl.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.063
-Aah!
-Oh, they're back.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.733
-Ooh.
-And we're back.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.001
Come on, get a cocktail.
Come sit.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.869
Girl, I'm ready.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.337
Sit, take your shoes off, girl.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.772
Tell us the tea.
Tell us the tea, y'all.

09:32.772 --> 09:35.308
-Who wants to start?
-So what's the tea?

09:35.308 --> 09:37.877
Well, they first
started with Willow.

09:37.877 --> 09:38.878
She got really, really--

09:38.878 --> 09:40.079
-They loved her.
-They loved Willow.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.482
[cheering]

09:42.482 --> 09:46.152
They said that my second look,
they loved.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.887
And the first one,
they liked it,

09:47.887 --> 09:50.990
but they said it was kind of
like hot suburban mom,

09:50.990 --> 09:52.358
which is what I was going for.

09:52.358 --> 09:55.995
[all laugh]
So I feel on top of the world.

09:55.995 --> 09:57.764
As you should.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.899
[cheering]
Now, Miss Orion, girl,

09:59.899 --> 10:02.035
what was your mindset?
How are you?

10:02.035 --> 10:05.071
They said it's too busy,
and I'm, like, I don't see it.

10:05.071 --> 10:06.606
-This look?
-Yeah.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.508
Yeah, I don't personally
think it's too busy.

10:08.508 --> 10:12.812
I really do think
it's between you and June.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.747
Well, June,
how do you feel, bitch?

10:14.747 --> 10:17.050
Groundhog's Day.

10:17.050 --> 10:22.088
They really loved the fabric
on the second outfit.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.490
They were just, like,

10:23.490 --> 10:25.391
it looked like I was
struggling walking in it.

10:25.391 --> 10:28.294
And Ru said it looked like
my hair was not my hair.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.464
That hair, it felt like
it wasn't for you.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.199
It felt like it was
someone else's hair,

10:33.199 --> 10:35.168
and you don't want that.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.936
What? That was my favorite part.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.004
And I loved my hair, and I--

10:38.004 --> 10:39.806
You look like
Mary J. Blige, baby.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.140
Before I came here,

10:41.140 --> 10:43.610
I didn't have sisters
or a drag mother to loan hair,

10:43.610 --> 10:46.546
so I'm literally
commissioning all of my hair.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.181
What did they say
about this look?

10:48.181 --> 10:49.949
Michelle said it was too busy.

10:49.949 --> 10:52.585
I was, like, but last week
you told me details.

10:52.585 --> 10:56.022
Like, I really wanted to show
that, okay, I can do details.

10:56.022 --> 10:59.993
But I guess I should have
pulled back a little bit.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.295
I thought that the pieces
were gorgeous,

11:02.295 --> 11:05.698
but I felt like you did kinda
get in your head a little bit,

11:05.698 --> 11:09.536
and I felt like you looked
a little bit defeated.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.406
When you manifest that
you're not loving it,

11:13.406 --> 11:15.909
it can kind of spiral
into something more negative

11:15.909 --> 11:17.744
than it really needed to be.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.512
That's something
you gotta work on,

11:19.512 --> 11:22.882
and you keep fucking
yourself up mentally.

11:28.154 --> 11:32.425
It's so weird, because I've only
been doing drag two years,

11:32.425 --> 11:35.461
and it's just like
I know what I see myself,

11:35.461 --> 11:38.131
and it's, like, I have to, you
know, live up to everyone else.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.732
-No.
-And it's like--

11:39.732 --> 11:41.134
Don't be worried about
anything that we're doing.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.535
You need to focus on you.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.170
Can I just say, like, June,

11:44.170 --> 11:47.106
like, you were one of
the first people in the group

11:47.106 --> 11:51.077
to make me feel like, oh,
I feel like someone sees me.

11:51.077 --> 11:56.549
You might not have 10 years
of experience in drag--

11:56.549 --> 11:59.285
I'm not trying to make you cry
right now, you stupid bitch.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.354
DeJa's old also.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.555
But I feel like
you're being yourself.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.390
And that takes a lot of people

12:04.390 --> 12:05.491
a lot of time to figure out.

12:05.491 --> 12:08.094
I mean, I spent years

12:08.094 --> 12:09.796
seeing myself gain weight,

12:09.796 --> 12:12.565
looking at myself in the mirror,
not liking what I see,

12:12.565 --> 12:15.935
and I was just like,
let me just be me.

12:15.935 --> 12:19.539
June gives me that,
to dance and perform freely,

12:19.539 --> 12:22.075
and to just not care
what other people think.

12:22.075 --> 12:26.713
And then coming here,
I care so much what they think

12:26.713 --> 12:29.716
that I'm starting to forget
what I know.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.884
-Yeah.
-Yes.

12:31.884 --> 12:35.088
I do wanna have a moment
for Miss Maddy as well.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.223
I wanna save some time
for Miss Maddy.

12:37.223 --> 12:40.526
I thought they were
gonna love my resort,

12:40.526 --> 12:42.962
but honestly, like, none of the
judges liked the resort look.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.530
At least two or three
of the judges

12:44.530 --> 12:46.299
said it looked like
off-the-rack,

12:46.299 --> 12:49.335
which is, like, I sewed it
myself, so, hey, you know.

12:49.335 --> 12:52.672
But I was, like,
so fucking worried,

12:52.672 --> 12:53.873
like, going into this,

12:53.873 --> 12:55.908
just because everything
that I was trying to do,

12:55.908 --> 12:57.110
none of it worked out.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.978
I spent, like,
eight hours for no reason,

12:58.978 --> 13:01.414
and I had to bust this out
in, like, a lot less time.

13:01.414 --> 13:02.782
-But it looks amazing.
-It does.

13:02.782 --> 13:06.219
All right, ladies,
10 minutes till main stage.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.988
So you all--whoever wants
to get ready, get ready, but...

13:10.156 --> 13:12.959
This bitch done wrote
the whole script, girl.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.127
No, I'm not directing anything.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.762
Sorry, I'm gonna
shut the hell up.

13:15.762 --> 13:16.963
This ho done told everybody
what to do, how to do it,

13:16.963 --> 13:18.765
when to do it, how to say it,
how to get it.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.767
This bitch been telling us
what the fuck to do

13:20.767 --> 13:21.934
since she walked up in here.

13:21.934 --> 13:24.103
I talk way too much.

13:24.103 --> 13:26.506
-Go ahead, baby.
-Excuse me, girls.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.241
-Girl.
-Me, too, bitch.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.609
Oh, Lord.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.911
June.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.579
How you feeling?

13:33.579 --> 13:35.715
-Can you take my shoe off?
-Yeah.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.018
Take it off. Take it off.

13:39.018 --> 13:41.120
-Do your own thing.
-Take the shoe off.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.588
If I'm not safe,
I'm gonna send someone home.

13:42.588 --> 13:44.924
Period!

13:44.924 --> 13:47.126
Are you good?

13:47.126 --> 13:49.996
[speaking very softly,
inaudible]

13:49.996 --> 13:51.431
I want you to be that ho.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.599
And go ahead
and let that out now, bitch.

13:53.599 --> 13:56.769
Yeah, because when you get
out there, I need you to--yeah.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.304
Hey, you're gonna make it.

13:58.304 --> 14:01.674
Like, literally,
just do your thing.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.209
Don't cry.

14:03.209 --> 14:06.746
Just pull it together,
and just be you, okay?

14:06.746 --> 14:08.347
I believe in you, bitch.

14:12.051 --> 14:15.121
I don't think I deserve
to be in the bottom.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.222
I don't think you are.

14:16.222 --> 14:17.256
Do you think
it's gonna be Maddy?

14:17.256 --> 14:18.357
Mm-hmm.

14:18.357 --> 14:21.227
I just want y'all to just focus.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.730
I'm so proud of you.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.631
Like, you're doing, like--

14:25.631 --> 14:27.133
I just want you to stay so bad.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.735
You're doing an amazing job.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.503
You're doing amazing, sweetie.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.571
Thank you.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.439
Oh, I just don't want you to go.

14:33.439 --> 14:34.707
I'm gonna fight.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.808
-I need you here, I need you
here.
-I'm gonna fight.

14:35.808 --> 14:38.544
Like, if you can't do it,
do it for me.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.815
Baby, I'm sorry
that they didn't love it.

14:42.815 --> 14:43.950
Bitch, I'm pissed.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.485
I don't think it's the worst.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.587
Well, let's hope that they
don't think it's the worst, too.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.455
Look at Maddy right now, bitch.

14:49.455 --> 14:51.057
She's lip syncing
for somebody, honey.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.892
I think you need
to go get ready.

14:58.998 --> 15:02.201
I wanna stay
in this competition so badly,

15:02.201 --> 15:04.837
I'm going to entertain
the hell out of them.

15:06.472 --> 15:09.876
I just have to fight
extremely hard.

15:11.611 --> 15:15.915
Being a young, Black,
gay kid from the South,

15:15.915 --> 15:17.083
that's all I know how to do.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.785
It's ingrained in me.

15:20.987 --> 15:23.990
I'm about to lip sync
for my life.

15:25.258 --> 15:29.262
I am just laser-focused
on this lip sync right now.

15:29.262 --> 15:33.566
These girls can't keep me in
the competition or take me out.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.835
Only I can.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.973
I'm trying to act
like June is not even here.

15:40.973 --> 15:43.576
I can't let her get in my head
right now.

15:43.576 --> 15:46.579
In this moment,
it is me versus myself.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.381
This is, like,
where I show the judges

15:48.381 --> 15:50.483
why I'm in this competition.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.085
I don't know
what's really going on,

15:53.085 --> 15:55.788
but what I do know,
we're going somewhere,

15:55.788 --> 15:57.423
and it's not home.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.060
All right, ladies,
time for the main stage.

16:01.060 --> 16:02.061
Follow me.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.629
Let's go, y'all.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.998
Ooh! Aah!

16:05.998 --> 16:07.166
Bitch, I can't feel
my lower half, honey.

16:07.166 --> 16:10.536
This corset done yanked the ho.

16:10.536 --> 16:12.038
RuPaul:
Welcome back, ladies.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.973
I've made some decisions.

16:14.173 --> 16:16.175
RuPaul: June Jambalaya.

16:16.175 --> 16:18.811
Maddy Morphosis.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.680
The time has come

16:20.680 --> 16:22.548
for you to lip sync

16:22.548 --> 16:27.019
for your life.

16:27.019 --> 16:30.690
Maddy Morphosis,
shantay you stay.

16:30.690 --> 16:34.727
June, sashay away.

16:39.365 --> 16:42.602
I knew it was coming,

16:42.602 --> 16:45.872
and I said, let me get out
of these box braids

16:45.872 --> 16:49.008
and have my pussycat wig
and my jungle dress,

16:49.008 --> 16:52.245
and just, you know, live this
fantasy on these people's stage.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.947
Werk. She didn't, honey.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.716
She didn't werk.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.553
I'm sad, obviously,

17:00.553 --> 17:02.655
because no one wants to be
first to go home.

17:02.655 --> 17:07.026
This Jambalaya is definitely
still cooking right now.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.495
Sometimes, you know,
when the rice ain't all the way
there,

17:09.495 --> 17:10.796
you just gotta let it cook
a little bit

17:10.796 --> 17:11.964
till the rice is right.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.799
That's when you add
everything else in it.

17:13.799 --> 17:16.569
So we gonna let the rice cook
a little bit more.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.239
I wish things
would have been different,

17:20.239 --> 17:23.376
but they're just
lessons learned.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.912
All the people that were,
like, backing me,

17:25.912 --> 17:27.280
I just hope that, you know,

17:27.280 --> 17:29.382
I ain't disappoint them
too much, chile.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.018
You know, Black people
real competitive.

17:32.018 --> 17:35.788
They gonna be at home telling
me,
"You shoulda won."

17:35.788 --> 17:37.323
This is from Miss Kornbread.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.125
"I am beyond proud of you.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.192
"Hold your head high.

17:40.192 --> 17:42.094
"Keep your shoes on.

17:42.094 --> 17:44.530
P.S., leave me this heart wig."

17:48.601 --> 17:51.938
I was, like, most excited
to wear this wig.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.409
Oh.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.810
Fine.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.113
[sniffles] Oh.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.618
Kornbread asked to keep it.

18:07.987 --> 18:10.623
Miss Kornbread, she love
her frizzy hair, honey.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.726
I...

18:18.464 --> 18:22.702
I enjoy performing so much.

18:22.702 --> 18:27.540
I...

18:27.540 --> 18:31.811
want to be able
to do it forever.

18:31.811 --> 18:35.648
I still know that I'm going to
get the opportunity to perform

18:35.648 --> 18:41.220
and do what sets
my soul on fire.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.690
Don't make the mistake
that I did,

18:44.690 --> 18:48.094
looking at the room
of where you don't fit.

18:48.094 --> 18:51.797
Look at where you stand out.

18:51.797 --> 18:56.969
Never stop embracing what
makes you different and special.

18:56.969 --> 19:00.306
It was fun, it was real,

19:00.306 --> 19:03.309
but most importantly, I was me.

19:07.046 --> 19:10.783
The most beautiful thing
about this journey,

19:10.783 --> 19:13.452
people always told me
when I become old enough,

19:13.452 --> 19:15.354
I'll find my chosen family.

19:15.354 --> 19:22.261
I didn't understand it at 15,
but I do now.

19:22.261 --> 19:24.964
I hope y'all come get this
Jambalaya special on the road.
