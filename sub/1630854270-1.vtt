WEBVTT

01:00.562 --> 01:01.896
- I don't understand
what's going on.

01:01.930 --> 01:04.431
They're taking too
long to get in there.

01:04.464 --> 01:05.299
Radio them now

01:08.068 --> 01:09.236
- Team Six, we
have you on the scanner.

01:09.269 --> 01:11.539
You need to move fast!

01:11.573 --> 01:13.140
- We're
running outta time.

01:13.173 --> 01:16.209
They need to take the pills
before they enter the graveyard.

01:37.732 --> 01:39.801
- Medieval
central Spain was home

01:39.834 --> 01:43.437
to one of the largest bubonic
plagues to ever hit Europe:

01:43.470 --> 01:44.806
the Black Death.

01:44.839 --> 01:49.510
Although the last infected
victim was buried in 1356,

01:49.544 --> 01:52.614
it has been said that
he was buried alive,

01:52.647 --> 01:55.984
and some have said his
screams can still be heard

01:56.017 --> 01:58.251
throughout this one
secret graveyard.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.922
Recent reports claim

02:00.955 --> 02:02.824
that locals have
gone into the forest

02:02.857 --> 02:06.159
as if they were in a trance,
following the screams,

02:06.193 --> 02:07.996
and have not returned.

02:08.029 --> 02:10.732
A secret society has
assembled a black ops team

02:10.765 --> 02:14.035
of mercenaries, known
as Project Legion,

02:14.068 --> 02:17.371
to secure the area in
order to conduct research

02:17.404 --> 02:20.240
in hopes to find
the missing persons.

02:21.441 --> 02:24.112
Although experimental,
the medication prescribed

02:24.144 --> 02:28.016
should limit their
symptoms after exposure.

03:03.985 --> 03:05.385
- Copy HQ. Headin' through now.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.321
ETA 15 minutes.

03:10.091 --> 03:11.592
- What's the damn rush?

03:11.626 --> 03:14.762
They do realize this
is, exactly right here.

03:14.796 --> 03:15.630
Vicious.

03:16.998 --> 03:19.332
This is the forest
of nightmares.

03:27.141 --> 03:28.543
- Did you guys see that?

03:29.844 --> 03:31.045
Junk.

03:31.079 --> 03:33.014
They don't make shit
like that in USA.

03:33.047 --> 03:35.215
- I should have
stayed at the crib.

03:45.325 --> 03:46.293
- Team Six,
we have you on the scanner.

03:46.326 --> 03:48.361
You need to move fast!

03:51.699 --> 03:53.835
- HQ. Inside sector.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.537
Your drone is down.

03:56.571 --> 03:59.173
Our lights are doing exactly
what you told us they would.

03:59.207 --> 04:01.142
Preparing to light flares.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.783
HQ, be advised I hear a bell.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.153
HQ, you copy?

04:12.186 --> 04:13.187
HQ!

04:15.156 --> 04:17.191
All right, boys.
We're in a dead zone.

04:17.225 --> 04:19.426
Any and all
communications are gone.

04:20.128 --> 04:21.394
- I don't understand...

04:21.428 --> 04:23.231
why they can't just...

04:23.263 --> 04:24.699
get satellite images.

04:24.732 --> 04:25.733
It's strange.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.602
- It's not your
job to understand.

04:31.873 --> 04:33.306
- All right, boys. Pills.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.816
Let's spark these
flares and get going.

04:51.793 --> 04:52.727
Y'all ready?

04:52.760 --> 04:53.360
- Ready.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.294
- Let's move on.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.585
- What the heck?

05:50.618 --> 05:51.986
It's like we're walking
through a giant campfire pit.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.921
There's like three
feet of ash down here.

05:53.955 --> 05:56.724
- Ash or not, orders to get
the center of this thing.

05:58.292 --> 06:00.393
- Over there. Solids ground.

06:05.867 --> 06:07.268
- That was fun.

06:07.301 --> 06:08.836
What now, Greg?

06:08.870 --> 06:09.937
- I don't know, bud.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.307
Our job is to clear this area

06:13.341 --> 06:15.509
so they can bring
the research team in.

06:16.177 --> 06:16.978
- Any idea why?

06:17.011 --> 06:17.845
- Orders.

06:21.282 --> 06:22.750
- Shit.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.218
- What was that?

06:24.252 --> 06:26.354
- I thought when
I booked this gig

06:26.386 --> 06:28.890
I was gonna see a bull fight,

06:28.923 --> 06:31.058
find me a sexy senorita.

06:31.092 --> 06:32.159
The hell with this!

06:32.193 --> 06:34.394
The money ain't worth shit!

06:34.427 --> 06:36.564
- All right. Keep it
together, soldier.

06:37.265 --> 06:39.200
- The history of this place.

06:39.233 --> 06:42.503
666 years later,
on this exact date?

06:42.536 --> 06:45.139
The locals called this
place the ash dobbles.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.439
Dobbles!

06:46.473 --> 06:48.876
- There has to be an
explanation for this.

06:48.910 --> 06:49.911
Find that bell.

06:50.845 --> 06:51.879
Find that bell!

06:59.387 --> 07:00.354
Hey.

07:00.388 --> 07:01.488
Hey, on me!

07:03.324 --> 07:04.158
Hey!

07:05.092 --> 07:05.927
On me!

07:34.322 --> 07:35.923
- The others
didn't make it.

07:35.957 --> 07:37.291
It works.

07:37.325 --> 07:38.125
It didn't turn.

08:11.892 --> 08:15.162
- Baby! Oh, I'm so
glad you made it!

08:15.196 --> 08:18.265
- Bro, you crazy son of
a bitch, you made it out.

08:18.299 --> 08:19.300
- I need a drink.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.601
- Well let's get you one.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.343
I am gonna kiss that girl
at the end of the night.

08:29.377 --> 08:32.079
- You dick, you,
ain't got a chance.

08:32.113 --> 08:33.247
- Bullshit.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.016
- You call bullshit
on everything.

08:35.049 --> 08:36.550
You even like
wearing those glasses

08:36.584 --> 08:38.953
'cause you think
they're a good piece.

08:40.054 --> 08:42.323
You did kiss me on
the first night.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.858
- I need these glasses to see.

08:48.029 --> 08:51.098
- Those are definitely
a conversation piece.

08:51.132 --> 08:52.400
- Yeah.

08:52.433 --> 08:54.235
I did kiss you that first night.

08:55.870 --> 08:56.804
- You dick.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.075
Can I talk to you?

09:03.477 --> 09:05.479
I want to take you
dinner tonight.

09:05.514 --> 09:07.782
But I have to work tonight.

09:09.450 --> 09:12.119
My guy, can I help
you something?

09:35.142 --> 09:35.976
Stay away from Cindy.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.055
Ah, you want some more do you?

10:09.578 --> 10:11.245
- Hey. Good work.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.680
- Where were you on that one?

10:12.713 --> 10:13.747
- You had it.

10:16.484 --> 10:17.751
- Four shots of fireball.

10:20.321 --> 10:21.822
- We're not kissing right now.

10:21.856 --> 10:23.357
- There's always tomorrow.

10:30.898 --> 10:33.568
- I have these ready for you.

10:33.602 --> 10:34.668
Doctor's orders.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.607
- Isn't that your neighbor?

10:38.639 --> 10:39.840
- Yeah

11:18.679 --> 11:20.615
- Hey, Georgie! My man!

11:20.649 --> 11:21.916
- Keep walking.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.987
- Georgie, have you
ever been in love?

11:34.629 --> 11:37.031
- Sick of cleaning your mess.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.633
- How are you feeling?

12:11.666 --> 12:12.766
- Don't know.

12:17.738 --> 12:20.040
- It'll come back to you.

13:57.706 --> 13:58.707
- Cindy.

14:03.077 --> 14:05.045
Come back to me soon.

14:19.193 --> 14:20.027
Go away!

14:25.767 --> 14:26.867
Okay, okay.

14:27.702 --> 14:28.536
Okay!

14:38.680 --> 14:39.514
Yeah.

14:55.864 --> 14:57.097
Karen?

15:06.741 --> 15:07.975
Karen?

15:08.643 --> 15:09.943
Hey, Karen!

15:25.325 --> 15:26.927
Atta girl, Karen.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.497
You should always get laid.

15:45.713 --> 15:47.080
Wait a second.

15:48.783 --> 15:49.684
Probably is.

15:56.190 --> 15:57.191
Hello?

15:57.224 --> 15:58.526
Where you at, bro?

15:58.560 --> 15:59.159
Give me a call right now.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.167
- Where's decom at?

16:09.938 --> 16:11.873
There's too many voicemails.

16:11.906 --> 16:12.807
Voicemail.

16:14.943 --> 16:15.910
Hello?

16:42.302 --> 16:44.606
What the hell's going on?

19:56.064 --> 19:57.598
Who's out there?

19:59.867 --> 20:00.668
Hello!

20:03.236 --> 20:04.939
This isn't a game!

20:07.942 --> 20:09.242
I have a...

20:09.276 --> 20:10.410
I have gun!

20:18.019 --> 20:19.187
I'm serious!

20:29.163 --> 20:32.100
I'm comin' for you fuckers!

21:06.667 --> 21:08.169
Who's out there?

22:01.889 --> 22:02.723
Hello?

22:06.794 --> 22:08.495
Are you guys okay?

22:12.934 --> 22:13.768
Hey!

22:19.307 --> 22:21.275
Hey!

22:23.611 --> 22:24.444
Karen!

22:27.347 --> 22:28.381
Karen.

22:44.065 --> 22:45.266
Oh my God.

22:45.299 --> 22:48.502
- Someone
help! Please, anyone!

22:51.906 --> 22:54.942
- Someone drugged me.
This is not right.

22:57.612 --> 23:00.514
Was it Karen? Karen never would.

23:01.282 --> 23:02.449
Cindy? I wish.

23:32.179 --> 23:34.081
Please work. Please work.

23:35.383 --> 23:36.617
- I'm sorry,

23:36.651 --> 23:38.386
your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

23:38.418 --> 23:39.452
Please-

23:40.288 --> 23:41.289
- Work.

23:42.256 --> 23:43.357
- I'm sorry,

23:43.391 --> 23:45.293
your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

23:45.326 --> 23:46.227
Please text the number-

23:47.528 --> 23:48.428
- Hello, you've
reached Bill and Debbie.

23:48.461 --> 23:49.997
Thank you for calling.

23:50.031 --> 23:52.199
We're sorry we're unable to
get to the phone right now.

23:52.233 --> 23:55.603
We're currently vacationing
in the Bahamas.

23:55.636 --> 23:57.405
But Bill and I are doing great,

23:57.437 --> 23:59.173
enjoying retirement
and seeing the world.

23:59.206 --> 24:02.143
Please leave us your name,
number, and a detailed message.

24:02.176 --> 24:04.712
We'll be sure to get back
with you as soon as we can.

24:04.745 --> 24:07.148
Have a blessed day. Goodbye.

24:30.104 --> 24:31.305
- Hey.

24:31.339 --> 24:32.573
Hello.

24:59.867 --> 25:01.602
Mom, Dad.

25:02.470 --> 25:04.905
Don't be a pussy. Fuckin' dad.

25:23.758 --> 25:24.592
Yeah.

25:28.396 --> 25:30.231
I'm coming for you!

25:56.223 --> 25:57.658
It's about to go down.

25:58.993 --> 25:59.827
Let's go.

26:40.868 --> 26:41.702
Karen.

26:59.554 --> 27:00.788
Karen?

27:04.692 --> 27:06.595
You should go back in your room.

27:06.627 --> 27:08.796
Go back in your room.

27:09.497 --> 27:10.998
Back in your room.

27:17.872 --> 27:18.839
Karen!

27:18.873 --> 27:21.775
I haven't seen
you since the bar.

27:22.577 --> 27:23.811
Everything all right?

27:26.413 --> 27:28.382
Karen, this has gone too far.

27:36.824 --> 27:38.025
Karen, are you okay?

27:39.393 --> 27:40.995
What happened?

27:41.028 --> 27:41.962
- Greg, go!

27:42.796 --> 27:44.231
- Karen.

27:46.734 --> 27:49.837
- Greg, go!

27:49.870 --> 27:51.906
- Karen, are you okay?

27:53.542 --> 27:54.441
- Greg, go!

27:55.610 --> 27:56.443
Leave! Go!

27:58.345 --> 27:59.480
Leave!

27:59.514 --> 28:01.315
Go!

28:01.348 --> 28:02.349
Go!

28:04.318 --> 28:05.452
Get!

28:57.639 --> 28:59.406
- Help, please.

29:01.475 --> 29:02.776
It's so cold.

29:28.737 --> 29:29.970
- Come on!

30:09.977 --> 30:13.447
- Someone
help! Please, anyone!

30:14.783 --> 30:15.816
Please!

30:16.718 --> 30:17.951
Please!

30:23.725 --> 30:25.426
- This isn't real.

30:27.861 --> 30:29.396
This isn't real.

32:48.969 --> 32:50.538
Someone in there?

32:52.941 --> 32:54.107
Come on out.

34:21.061 --> 34:22.597
This is a dream.

34:24.131 --> 34:27.334
Mills, you dick,
you poisoned me.

34:27.367 --> 34:29.804
Mills, you dick, you drugged me.

34:29.837 --> 34:31.639
Pills. Pills, pills.

34:49.824 --> 34:50.658
What?

35:56.256 --> 35:58.191
What is happening?

35:58.225 --> 35:59.259
What is...

36:44.605 --> 36:48.375
Laugh all you want, you're
not getting in here!

36:58.218 --> 36:59.587
Keep laughing!

37:52.907 --> 37:53.741
Hello?

37:54.474 --> 37:56.343
To whoever this...

37:56.376 --> 38:00.548
To whoever sees this, my
name is is Greg Rourke.

38:01.549 --> 38:04.317
This video message is
for whoever finds this.

38:07.221 --> 38:11.291
Something...

38:11.324 --> 38:13.194
Something is happening,
and I don't know...

38:13.227 --> 38:14.762
I don't know, I don't
know, I don't...

38:14.796 --> 38:16.831
I don't know what.
I don't know what.

38:21.334 --> 38:23.271
There are things in the hallway.

38:23.303 --> 38:24.772
There was one in my room,

38:24.806 --> 38:28.475
and it got out of my window
before I knew anything.

38:29.577 --> 38:30.477
They're definitely...

38:30.511 --> 38:32.513
They're definitely not human.

38:36.383 --> 38:40.453
I barricaded myself in my
apartment, and I'm safer.

38:41.923 --> 38:43.423
I think I'm safer now.

38:45.059 --> 38:47.161
The cell phones don't work.

38:47.195 --> 38:48.930
My TV is out.

38:50.298 --> 38:54.735
The power is gone, but
the power is flickering.

38:57.205 --> 38:59.707
I hear noises in the hallway.

39:00.975 --> 39:02.375
Screaming and...

39:05.213 --> 39:07.414
And laughing! And laughing.

39:09.416 --> 39:11.118
I'm not crazy. This...

39:11.152 --> 39:14.722
I woke up this morning and
the world has gone to hell.

39:16.290 --> 39:19.392
If you're seeing this, I
hope it's not too late,

39:19.426 --> 39:24.632
but please send help,
or help yourself.

39:37.879 --> 39:39.680
Hello?

39:39.714 --> 39:40.514
Karen?

39:43.416 --> 39:44.218
Episode...

39:44.252 --> 39:46.220
This is my first video.

39:46.254 --> 39:47.688
I will try to leave more.

39:49.190 --> 39:50.024
Karen!

39:56.330 --> 39:57.832
Karen!

39:57.865 --> 39:58.866
- Not Karen.

40:08.376 --> 40:09.377
- What do you mean not K...

40:09.409 --> 40:11.612
What do you mean
you're not Karen?

40:11.646 --> 40:13.413
You're my neighbor.

40:16.651 --> 40:17.484
Karen?

40:22.523 --> 40:25.192
Yeah, you are, Karen.

40:25.226 --> 40:26.493
We're buds.

40:28.329 --> 40:30.131
- Are we?

40:30.164 --> 40:31.498
We've barely spoke.

40:34.936 --> 40:39.439
- What are...

40:39.472 --> 40:44.645
What are you?

40:47.348 --> 40:48.649
- The darkness.

40:59.593 --> 41:01.128
- Are you alive?

41:03.597 --> 41:05.566
- What do you want?

41:09.870 --> 41:10.705
- You.

41:11.706 --> 41:13.874
- Karen, you're too young.

41:13.908 --> 41:16.444
We tried this,
and there's Cindy.

41:16.476 --> 41:18.312
And then there's Cindy.

41:22.516 --> 41:25.553
You're too young,
and I have Cindy.

41:27.388 --> 41:28.656
- We just want you.

41:29.757 --> 41:31.926
You're one of the lucky ones.

41:31.959 --> 41:33.194
- Lucky?

41:33.227 --> 41:34.195
Lucky ones?

41:37.064 --> 41:37.898
Karen...

41:40.201 --> 41:41.002
No.

41:43.037 --> 41:44.572
No, I'm not.

41:44.605 --> 41:47.942
I'm not a lucky one,
Karen. This is...

41:55.383 --> 41:57.084
- You're still human.

41:59.487 --> 42:01.522
- Where am I, Karen?

42:03.391 --> 42:05.593
Where are my friends?

42:06.627 --> 42:07.661
- They're happy.

42:13.267 --> 42:16.937
Many didn't realize it at
the time, but they're happy.

42:17.972 --> 42:18.973
- Happy? No.

42:20.608 --> 42:22.610
No, no, no, no.

42:22.643 --> 42:25.279
This isn't happy.

42:28.449 --> 42:30.551
Hey...

42:31.652 --> 42:32.686
Are you dad?

42:35.322 --> 42:36.957
- Greg, just come
out and say hi.

42:37.925 --> 42:39.960
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

42:48.469 --> 42:49.870
- This is a dream.

42:51.705 --> 42:53.207
- I can come in.

42:54.475 --> 42:56.177
And I can help you
figure that out.

42:57.578 --> 42:59.313
- No, no, no, no, no.

43:00.549 --> 43:01.449
No.

43:01.482 --> 43:02.483
No.

43:10.257 --> 43:12.626
Karen, if you come in here...

43:16.263 --> 43:17.098
I'll kill you!

43:22.703 --> 43:23.938
I'll kill you, Karen!

43:32.581 --> 43:33.948
- We can live.

43:35.015 --> 43:36.684
We enjoy you.

43:36.717 --> 43:38.119
- Who's we?

43:38.152 --> 43:38.986
We who?

43:40.955 --> 43:41.789
- We?

43:43.224 --> 43:44.058
Legion.

43:44.959 --> 43:45.793
Darkness

44:01.510 --> 44:02.743
213.

44:03.978 --> 44:06.680
You can't keep us out forever.

44:11.418 --> 44:12.453
- Ha.

44:12.486 --> 44:13.721
Try me.

44:15.489 --> 44:16.323
Karen.

44:40.515 --> 44:42.584
Hello, this is...

44:42.617 --> 44:45.753
this is Greg Rourke.
This is my second video.

44:46.655 --> 44:48.255
I'm under the conclusion that...

44:49.924 --> 44:52.426
whatever's happening
is something...

44:53.595 --> 44:55.429
something I can't
explain, something...

44:56.964 --> 44:58.832
something I don't know.

45:00.635 --> 45:02.970
It's definitely not
a terrorist attack.

45:05.239 --> 45:06.040
Some kind of earthquake.

45:06.073 --> 45:09.777
It's something far, far worse.

45:14.516 --> 45:15.349
Creatures.

45:16.250 --> 45:17.284
There are creatures.

45:20.187 --> 45:23.592
And the creature, they
take the form of people.

45:23.625 --> 45:25.292
People that I know.

45:25.326 --> 45:26.160
Karen.

45:27.562 --> 45:29.863
They changed Karen.

45:44.512 --> 45:45.813
Is the water?

45:46.615 --> 45:48.115
This is not water.

45:56.390 --> 45:57.224
I don't...

45:59.827 --> 46:03.598
I don't know if
something has caused this

46:03.632 --> 46:07.334
or something set loose.

46:09.236 --> 46:11.740
Something we've
never experienced.

46:11.772 --> 46:13.807
It's almost like it's...

46:15.577 --> 46:17.378
like it's evil.

46:27.722 --> 46:28.989
I'm not crazy.

46:31.593 --> 46:32.426
This...

46:33.260 --> 46:34.094
This is real.

46:36.665 --> 46:37.498
Can you hear it?

46:38.767 --> 46:40.000
I can...

46:40.669 --> 46:41.569
Can you hear them?

46:42.803 --> 46:44.104
I can hear...

46:45.774 --> 46:46.775
You're not...

46:46.807 --> 46:47.941
I hear you!

46:52.747 --> 46:53.981
- Greg.

46:55.717 --> 46:57.786
- Keep scratching. Keep...

46:57.818 --> 46:59.987
- After all
we've been through?

47:00.020 --> 47:01.589
Why treat you this way?

47:02.524 --> 47:03.824
- You're not real.

47:03.857 --> 47:06.594
- Greg, I can come in, and
we can have a talk as adults.

47:07.729 --> 47:09.531
I promise.

47:09.564 --> 47:11.398
I do really wanna hurt you.

47:13.668 --> 47:15.269
You can't stay in there forever.

47:16.136 --> 47:16.970
- Yeah.

47:31.820 --> 47:33.521
- I'm gonna die alone.

47:33.555 --> 47:38.058
Where's, the gun, where's
the gun, where's the gun?

47:41.428 --> 47:43.430
Car.

47:43.464 --> 47:44.599
Gun's in the car.

47:44.632 --> 47:46.500
Put gas in the car.

47:46.534 --> 47:48.670
Did you put gas in the car?

47:48.703 --> 47:51.673
And soon you'll be outta here.

47:51.706 --> 47:53.941
Gotta get in the garage.

49:42.049 --> 49:43.818
You're not dying.

49:43.852 --> 49:45.820
Get outta here.

49:45.854 --> 49:47.589
Let's get outta here.

50:27.027 --> 50:29.998
All right, we gotta
make it to the car.

50:30.030 --> 50:31.966
Make it to the freeway.

50:32.000 --> 50:32.800
Gas.

50:32.834 --> 50:34.167
Gas, gas, gas, gas.

50:34.201 --> 50:36.370
Get the hell outta here.

50:56.089 --> 50:57.659
Get outta here.

51:05.800 --> 51:06.634
- Go!

51:55.984 --> 51:57.217
Georgie?

55:12.146 --> 55:13.380
Karen.

56:10.671 --> 56:13.174
What's going on? This is Greg.

56:13.207 --> 56:14.809
This is my third video.

56:16.344 --> 56:21.249
I hear sirens and helicopters.

56:21.282 --> 56:23.551
Society seems like it's still...

56:24.218 --> 56:25.452
still intact.

56:27.221 --> 56:32.627
I have enough food for maybe
one and a half, two days tops.

56:36.898 --> 56:39.667
I just tried to get down
to my car, get my weapon.

56:40.635 --> 56:41.335
Nothing.

56:41.369 --> 56:42.203
Power doesn't work. Power's out.

56:42.236 --> 56:43.571
Phone doesn't work.

56:45.539 --> 56:46.741
They're weak.

56:46.774 --> 56:50.044
They're not as strong
as I, as you, think.

56:50.077 --> 56:53.080
It's definitely, definitely
real, definitely real.

56:59.287 --> 57:03.057
Karen, no!

57:03.090 --> 57:04.025
You're not getting...

57:04.058 --> 57:07.494
Karen's turned, and
she's in the hallway.

57:07.528 --> 57:08.663
In the hallway, in the hallway.

57:08.696 --> 57:09.964
And I gotta get
Cindy, and I gotta...

57:13.267 --> 57:14.268
I gotta...

57:14.302 --> 57:16.370
This is real, everybody.

57:16.404 --> 57:19.439
Things are crazy, going on.

57:19.472 --> 57:20.341
I gotta get...

57:21.309 --> 57:22.543
Trying. You don't wanna come in.

57:22.576 --> 57:25.478
Y'all don't wanna come in here.

57:28.683 --> 57:30.618
I think I figure
out how to beat him.

57:31.719 --> 57:33.421
If anybody's watching,

57:33.453 --> 57:34.555
in the hall I was talking
to a bunch of dead people.

57:34.588 --> 57:36.090
If you're watching this...

57:38.125 --> 57:40.460
send help, find help.

57:41.162 --> 57:42.063
They want your organs.

57:42.096 --> 57:43.297
That's what they want, organs.

57:43.331 --> 57:44.432
I've been smoking,
I've been drinking,

57:44.464 --> 57:47.201
and I've got gall
stones, so, ha ha ha!

57:47.234 --> 57:49.537
Ha, joke's on you, Karen!

57:53.074 --> 57:55.509
This is real. This is real.

57:57.812 --> 57:59.413
I need to figure out
how to get outta here.

57:59.447 --> 58:01.282
I can only hunker down
a little bit longer.

58:01.315 --> 58:02.350
And I gotta get to Detroit.

58:02.383 --> 58:04.018
I gotta get Cindy.

58:05.019 --> 58:07.722
I gotta get Cindy, get
to Detroit, see my mom.

58:07.755 --> 58:08.589
And...

58:16.464 --> 58:17.732
power's still down.

58:17.765 --> 58:19.734
I'll try my other TV.

58:25.706 --> 58:28.609
If you're watching
this, send help.

58:29.777 --> 58:33.147
And if you're bunch of
dead people, it's too late.

58:52.333 --> 58:53.367
Come on.

58:58.239 --> 59:01.475
- We are reporting
live from the WRX studios,

59:01.510 --> 59:04.412
where hell has been
released onto the city.

59:04.445 --> 59:06.947
The end of the
human race is here.

59:06.981 --> 59:08.549
We are doomed.

59:08.582 --> 59:11.052
I urge every one of
you to stay inside.

59:11.085 --> 59:12.620
- Yeah, I'm inside, I'm inside.
Come on, come on, come on.

59:12.653 --> 59:13.854
- And whatever
the hell this is,

59:13.888 --> 59:17.024
they are watching
you, so stay inside!

59:18.092 --> 59:20.529
Pray that we can get
through this together.

59:20.561 --> 59:21.896
Please pray. And...

59:23.064 --> 59:24.165
Hold on.

59:24.198 --> 59:25.466
Just a second.

59:25.499 --> 59:27.701
I just got word from
boots on the ground

59:27.735 --> 59:30.505
that they are setting
fire to City Hall.

59:30.539 --> 59:31.972
And just earlier today,

59:32.006 --> 59:36.010
they invaded Stevenson High
School off of 57th and Maine.

59:36.043 --> 59:38.513
These are our kids
we're talking about!

59:38.547 --> 59:40.247
Our future!

59:40.281 --> 59:42.783
Jesus fuck! Is anyone listening?

59:42.817 --> 59:43.818
- Me. Me.
- We are doomed!

59:43.851 --> 59:46.387
- I am.
- We're fucked!

59:46.420 --> 59:48.189
We're screwed!

59:48.222 --> 59:49.524
Who's out there?

59:49.558 --> 59:50.391
Is there anyone out there?

59:50.424 --> 59:51.859
- Me! I am!

59:51.892 --> 59:53.961
- The whole
world's going to shit!

59:53.994 --> 59:54.795
Dear God!

59:54.829 --> 59:56.063
- No!

59:57.031 --> 59:57.631
- I wish.

59:57.665 --> 59:59.166
- Oh my God!

59:59.200 --> 1:00:01.702
They're starting to
come through the doors!

1:00:01.735 --> 1:00:03.237
They're everywhere!

1:00:03.270 --> 1:00:07.241
But that's all the time
we have for today, folks.

1:00:07.274 --> 1:00:08.476
Goodnight. Be well.

1:00:17.586 --> 1:00:18.919
- Took you long enough

1:04:44.686 --> 1:04:45.520
Let's go!

1:05:09.977 --> 1:05:11.579
- Hey, Greg. it's Mills?

1:05:13.480 --> 1:05:14.314
- Mills?

1:05:17.519 --> 1:05:18.352
Mills!

1:05:19.119 --> 1:05:20.487
- Yeah, buddy, it's me.

1:05:23.892 --> 1:05:25.125
- Wills, is that you?

1:05:26.093 --> 1:05:28.095
- Yeah. Doesn't
it sound like me?

1:05:29.930 --> 1:05:31.098
- Are you okay?

1:05:31.131 --> 1:05:33.934
- Dude, it's crazy.

1:05:33.967 --> 1:05:35.269
Something happened.

1:05:36.905 --> 1:05:38.773
I'm not sure, man.

1:05:38.807 --> 1:05:40.441
The devil is infecting people.

1:05:41.341 --> 1:05:42.443
- The devil, nah.

1:05:42.476 --> 1:05:43.310
It's...

1:05:44.779 --> 1:05:46.548
It's not.

1:05:46.581 --> 1:05:48.750
- Yeah, it's nuts out here.

1:05:48.783 --> 1:05:50.250
Even the army's in town.

1:05:51.218 --> 1:05:51.985
- Army?

1:05:52.019 --> 1:05:52.821
Army's here?

1:05:52.854 --> 1:05:54.054
- Yeah.

1:05:54.988 --> 1:05:57.892
- I have no cell
phone. The TV's down.

1:05:57.926 --> 1:06:00.160
The power's out. I have
no idea what's going on.

1:06:00.194 --> 1:06:02.396
- Yeah, all the communication
was all shut down.

1:06:02.429 --> 1:06:04.799
I was with Cindy
when it happened.

1:06:04.833 --> 1:06:06.133
- Cindy?

1:06:06.166 --> 1:06:07.267
You're with Cindy?

1:06:08.703 --> 1:06:10.605
- She's downstairs. She's okay.

1:06:10.638 --> 1:06:12.740
- Hey, man, why
are you with Cindy?

1:06:12.774 --> 1:06:14.141
- Don't worry about it.

1:06:16.143 --> 1:06:19.213
- Why are you, Mills? You're
supposed to be my friend.

1:06:19.246 --> 1:06:21.683
Why are you trying to
sleep with my girl?

1:06:22.584 --> 1:06:23.885
- Are you serious, bro?

1:06:23.918 --> 1:06:25.720
- Are you
being serious, bro?

1:06:26.788 --> 1:06:29.791
- Bro, I don't know if you've
got a chance to look outside,

1:06:29.824 --> 1:06:32.326
but everything is
fucked up, man.

1:06:32.359 --> 1:06:34.596
- Yeah. My whole
apartment is barricaded.

1:06:34.629 --> 1:06:37.966
I know things are seriously
screwed up right now.

1:06:37.998 --> 1:06:39.601
Where's Cindy. Let me see her.

1:06:39.634 --> 1:06:41.468
Is she okay? Are you okay?

1:06:42.637 --> 1:06:44.706
- Yeah, I'm okay, and...

1:06:44.739 --> 1:06:46.139
Cindy is safe.

1:06:47.040 --> 1:06:48.710
- How did you get here?

1:06:48.743 --> 1:06:50.477
How did you get here, Mills?

1:06:51.679 --> 1:06:54.047
- We were gonna take a
cab when it all went down.

1:06:54.849 --> 1:06:56.183
We ended up walking.

1:06:57.184 --> 1:06:58.953
- It's seven
miles from Carnage.

1:06:58.987 --> 1:07:01.355
There's no power.
There's no lights.

1:07:01.388 --> 1:07:03.090
How did you see
through the dark?

1:07:03.123 --> 1:07:05.459
And how did you
get on my balcony?

1:07:05.492 --> 1:07:07.996
- Dude, what does
it even matter?

1:07:08.028 --> 1:07:10.030
We're here now, and
that's what counts.

1:07:10.063 --> 1:07:14.002
And those things,
those creatures...

1:07:14.034 --> 1:07:15.235
they're everywhere,

1:07:15.269 --> 1:07:16.971
but you just gotta
kick 'em in the head

1:07:17.005 --> 1:07:17.972
and they leave you alone.

1:07:18.006 --> 1:07:20.073
- No. You kick 'em.

1:07:20.107 --> 1:07:22.544
I just fought one down at...

1:07:22.577 --> 1:07:24.111
No, no, no. You're weak.

1:07:24.144 --> 1:07:26.480
You're a little scrawny, weak...

1:07:26.514 --> 1:07:27.214
You don't just...

1:07:27.247 --> 1:07:28.783
You don't just kick 'em, Mills.

1:07:28.816 --> 1:07:30.652
Something's not
right here, buddy.

1:07:30.685 --> 1:07:32.252
- Dude, what's your issue?

1:07:33.021 --> 1:07:34.589
- No. You.

1:07:34.622 --> 1:07:35.322
You're always with Cindy.

1:07:35.355 --> 1:07:36.958
You're my issue, Mills! You.

1:07:36.991 --> 1:07:37.892
You!

1:07:37.926 --> 1:07:39.527
You're trying to take my girl.

1:07:39.561 --> 1:07:42.129
Now you're on my balcony.
I don't know how.

1:07:42.162 --> 1:07:43.363
- You're crazy!

1:07:43.397 --> 1:07:44.966
- I'm not crazy.
Don't call me crazy.

1:07:44.999 --> 1:07:46.668
Don't call me crazy.
I'm not crazy.

1:07:46.701 --> 1:07:47.501
This isn't...

1:07:47.535 --> 1:07:48.636
This is real.

1:07:49.403 --> 1:07:51.739
- Just shut up and let me in.

1:07:51.773 --> 1:07:52.807
- No, Mills.

1:07:52.840 --> 1:07:54.207
I'm not letting you in.

1:07:54.241 --> 1:07:56.476
I don't know how you
got here in the dark.

1:07:57.745 --> 1:07:58.813
- 20/20 vision.

1:07:59.981 --> 1:08:01.549
- Ha ha!

1:08:01.583 --> 1:08:04.151
No, Mills.

1:08:04.184 --> 1:08:06.521
You don't have 20/20 vision.

1:08:07.989 --> 1:08:09.624
- Oh.

1:08:09.657 --> 1:08:10.490
Glasses.

1:08:11.559 --> 1:08:12.927
Right.

1:08:17.431 --> 1:08:21.569
Should have thought of that.

1:08:24.438 --> 1:08:26.007
Busted.

1:08:26.040 --> 1:08:26.975
- What...

1:08:27.008 --> 1:08:28.442
What do you mean you're...

1:08:28.475 --> 1:08:29.744
busted?

1:08:30.712 --> 1:08:32.914
- Open the door.

1:08:32.947 --> 1:08:34.214
- Where is Cindy?

1:08:34.247 --> 1:08:35.049
Mills, if you...

1:08:35.083 --> 1:08:36.684
If I open that door...

1:08:37.652 --> 1:08:38.720
I'm beatin' your ass.

1:08:41.188 --> 1:08:42.289
- Then let us in.

1:08:49.731 --> 1:08:50.565
Open.

1:08:51.599 --> 1:08:53.133
It will come in!

1:08:58.271 --> 1:09:00.008
- Come on. I'm ready.

1:09:00.041 --> 1:09:01.274
- Okay.

1:09:01.308 --> 1:09:03.678
Bad move, buddy. Bad move.

1:09:04.779 --> 1:09:06.581
- I'll see you, too, Mills.

1:10:51.451 --> 1:10:53.320
What's going on? This is Greg.

1:10:55.022 --> 1:10:59.527
I don't know if you guys know
the world has gone crazy.

1:11:00.928 --> 1:11:02.429
Mills is out there.

1:11:03.131 --> 1:11:04.632
He's not my friend anymore.

1:11:04.665 --> 1:11:08.636
Something else.
Something changes them.

1:11:10.171 --> 1:11:11.404
And Cindy...

1:11:12.540 --> 1:11:14.274
I don't know where you are.

1:11:15.710 --> 1:11:16.544
Okay.

1:11:19.446 --> 1:11:22.617
Remember that time we
were on that dinner date?

1:11:22.650 --> 1:11:25.019
We were trying to track down
that restaurant, Nelson's.

1:11:25.052 --> 1:11:25.887
Or was it...

1:11:27.255 --> 1:11:28.288
La Bouche?

1:11:32.527 --> 1:11:33.628
Milkshakes. You...

1:11:33.661 --> 1:11:36.063
We ordered three
milkshakes. I had two.

1:11:36.998 --> 1:11:38.398
You had a strawberry.

1:11:41.269 --> 1:11:42.937
There's so much...

1:11:42.970 --> 1:11:44.539
I wish I could have said to you.

1:11:46.207 --> 1:11:47.842
So much I wanted to say.

1:11:52.246 --> 1:11:55.116
Right. Those fries.

1:11:55.149 --> 1:11:56.217
We got two fries.

1:11:56.250 --> 1:11:57.518
You ate both of 'em.

1:11:57.552 --> 1:12:00.387
You mixed it up and made
a special sauce.

1:12:03.157 --> 1:12:04.592
This...

1:12:04.625 --> 1:12:08.428
This whole thing really
interfered with that.

1:12:11.232 --> 1:12:12.633
Could sure use you here now.

1:12:27.014 --> 1:12:28.683
I guess I messed up.

1:12:54.275 --> 1:12:55.442
Mills, go away.

1:12:56.944 --> 1:12:58.646
- Lots of food out here.

1:13:01.716 --> 1:13:04.417
- How much Mills is in you?

1:13:06.386 --> 1:13:07.822
- Huh?

1:13:07.855 --> 1:13:11.424
- I said, how much of my
friend Mills is in you?

1:13:12.660 --> 1:13:14.795
- Do you really want to know?

1:13:15.763 --> 1:13:17.665
- Yeah, man. What
happened to you?

1:13:18.933 --> 1:13:19.767
- Dead.

1:13:20.500 --> 1:13:21.936
Dead is better.

1:13:25.339 --> 1:13:27.440
- Man, we all used
to be friends.

1:13:29.543 --> 1:13:31.178
- Who said we were friends?

1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:36.483
The apple doesn't fall
far from its tree.

1:13:47.295 --> 1:13:48.996
- Where's Cindy?

1:13:49.030 --> 1:13:51.464
- Cindy is fine where she is.

1:13:56.203 --> 1:13:58.506
Be a devil and let us in.

1:14:09.383 --> 1:14:10.751
- I'm not you.

1:14:10.785 --> 1:14:11.619
- Huh?

1:15:26.660 --> 1:15:27.962
- Stupid Mills is out there.

1:15:27.995 --> 1:15:31.332
Gotta get to Carnage.
Gotta get my girl.

1:15:31.365 --> 1:15:32.466
Come on, get us outta here.

1:15:32.500 --> 1:15:33.567
Gotta get outta here.

1:15:35.436 --> 1:15:37.471
Think, think, think, think.

1:15:37.506 --> 1:15:39.373
It's got to be a dream.

1:15:40.541 --> 1:15:42.043
This could be real.

1:15:42.076 --> 1:15:43.711
Could be a dream.

1:15:49.250 --> 1:15:50.618
Hey, Mills...

1:15:52.019 --> 1:15:53.421
Mills?

1:15:53.454 --> 1:15:54.989
You still out there, buddy?

1:15:57.091 --> 1:15:57.892
Oh, Mills...

1:16:00.394 --> 1:16:01.762
I'm coming for you.

1:16:15.376 --> 1:16:17.378
This might be in my head.

1:16:17.411 --> 1:16:18.245
Might be a dream.

1:16:18.279 --> 1:16:19.080
I don't care. I'm going.

1:16:19.113 --> 1:16:20.614
I'm going. Gotta get...

1:16:20.648 --> 1:16:22.450
Gotta get Cindy. I
gotta outta here.

1:16:24.085 --> 1:16:28.189
- Greg, can't
you see? We're the same.

1:16:28.222 --> 1:16:31.592
- We are nothing,
nothing alike, Mills.

1:16:31.625 --> 1:16:33.794
You're weak! I'm strong!

1:16:33.828 --> 1:16:35.863
This might be a nightmare.
I'll tell you what.

1:16:35.896 --> 1:16:38.866
Somebody's nightmare is my
dream come true, brother!

1:16:38.899 --> 1:16:41.068
So you better fuckin' run!

1:16:41.102 --> 1:16:42.103
I'm coming for you!

1:16:42.136 --> 1:16:45.206
I'm gonna get my girl,
and I'm outta here!

1:16:45.239 --> 1:16:46.541
- Come on.

1:16:46.575 --> 1:16:49.511
What happened to my friend Greg?

1:16:49.544 --> 1:16:50.945
- Greg's gone, Mills.

1:16:50.978 --> 1:16:53.481
You are not gonna like
the guy that I become.

1:16:53.515 --> 1:16:55.716
You've pushed me to this, Mills.

1:16:55.749 --> 1:16:57.151
So I'm giving you a
chance to leave now

1:16:57.184 --> 1:16:59.120
before I come out
there and kick your ass

1:16:59.153 --> 1:17:03.324
your all the way to Carnage,
get Cindy, and get outta here.

1:17:03.357 --> 1:17:05.192
- Better
get ready, Greg.

1:17:05.226 --> 1:17:10.631
'Cause we're coming
for you.

1:17:16.637 --> 1:17:18.639
- Okay. This is Greg.

1:17:18.672 --> 1:17:21.775
This will be my last video.

1:17:22.577 --> 1:17:23.744
It's been a while.

1:17:24.979 --> 1:17:29.683
I am hungry, and I'm tired,
and I'm going back to Detroit.

1:17:30.918 --> 1:17:35.689
I am leaving all
of this...

1:17:36.625 --> 1:17:39.426
to whoever's still
alive or related to me,

1:17:39.460 --> 1:17:40.529
except for the goldfish.

1:17:40.562 --> 1:17:43.097
I'm bringing the
goldfish home with me.

1:17:43.130 --> 1:17:45.933
You know, should've
never left Detroit.

1:17:47.268 --> 1:17:50.404
I think living in mom's
basement doesn't seem...

1:17:51.672 --> 1:17:53.374
doesn't seem that bad anymore.

1:17:54.341 --> 1:17:55.342
Home cooking.

1:17:56.377 --> 1:18:00.181
Hookah's down there, fresh
hummus, baba ghanoush.

1:18:01.882 --> 1:18:03.150
Man, that sounds good right now.

1:18:03.184 --> 1:18:05.419
Cindy, you're gonna
love baba ghanoush.

1:18:05.452 --> 1:18:08.189
You're gonna love it. You're
gonna love baba ghanoush.

1:18:08.222 --> 1:18:09.056
And...

1:18:10.824 --> 1:18:12.960
Listen, Mom...

1:18:12.993 --> 1:18:13.894
and Dad...

1:18:14.828 --> 1:18:15.696
really Mom...

1:18:15.729 --> 1:18:17.131
I love you guys.

1:18:17.164 --> 1:18:21.202
I'm so excited for
you to meet Cindy.

1:18:21.235 --> 1:18:22.069
So...

1:18:23.070 --> 1:18:24.271
See you soon.

1:18:26.608 --> 1:18:29.276
- Are you coming out?

1:18:29.310 --> 1:18:30.911
- Yeah, I'm coming out.

1:18:31.712 --> 1:18:33.981
Can't wait. Are you ready?

1:18:34.014 --> 1:18:38.653
- I'm ready.
Come and join us.

1:18:38.687 --> 1:18:41.989
- Mills, before I come
out, can you just...

1:18:44.091 --> 1:18:44.925
Can you just be
real with me, man?

1:18:44.959 --> 1:18:46.561
What what's going on?

1:18:46.595 --> 1:18:50.464
- Do you
really want to know?

1:18:50.497 --> 1:18:51.600
- Yeah.

1:18:51.633 --> 1:18:52.433
Yeah, I really want to know

1:18:52.466 --> 1:18:53.702
- Every so often,

1:18:53.734 --> 1:18:58.540
the universe decides it
doesn't need certain things,

1:18:58.573 --> 1:19:01.075
and it disposes of them.

1:19:01.108 --> 1:19:02.644
- You mean me?

1:19:02.677 --> 1:19:05.580
- Yes, you. Humans.

1:19:05.614 --> 1:19:07.716
All of you, you're not needed

1:19:07.748 --> 1:19:09.984
and the universe
decided for you.

1:19:10.017 --> 1:19:12.920
And do you want
to know what else?

1:19:16.123 --> 1:19:17.091
- What?

1:19:17.124 --> 1:19:19.093
- I can choose for you.

1:19:19.827 --> 1:19:21.395
Evil always wins.

1:19:23.063 --> 1:19:25.799
And you don't have a choice now.

1:19:27.401 --> 1:19:28.869
Just join us.

1:19:29.638 --> 1:19:31.673
- No, Mills.

1:19:31.706 --> 1:19:32.806
Not me, buddy.

1:19:34.074 --> 1:19:36.977
I'm coming, I'm getting Cindy,
and we're getting outta here.

1:19:37.011 --> 1:19:37.646
You...

1:19:37.679 --> 1:19:38.713
You're weak.

1:19:38.747 --> 1:19:40.481
You might choose hell.

1:19:40.515 --> 1:19:42.049
I don't. I choose life.

1:19:42.082 --> 1:19:43.917
- That's unfortunate.

1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:48.523
Times running out for you, Greg.

1:19:49.591 --> 1:19:52.026
Now we're all coming for you.

1:19:55.664 --> 1:19:58.932
- Like I told you,
Mills, you can try.

1:19:59.833 --> 1:20:01.569
- Bad luck.

1:20:01.603 --> 1:20:04.271
We'll see you on the other side.

1:20:05.339 --> 1:20:06.206
- And I'll see you soon.

1:22:20.073 --> 1:22:22.710
Took you long enough.

1:22:22.744 --> 1:22:24.579
- Remember, the pills.

1:22:25.647 --> 1:22:26.980
She has you now.

1:22:27.948 --> 1:22:29.751
She always wins.

1:22:30.718 --> 1:22:32.986
- No, Mills, I always win.

1:25:33.968 --> 1:25:34.802
- Greg.

1:25:38.039 --> 1:25:39.007
- What's happening?

1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:39.874
- Are you okay?

1:25:42.944 --> 1:25:44.979
- Why's everybody looking at me?

1:25:45.013 --> 1:25:46.981
- Uh-uh. Look at me. Focus.

1:25:47.015 --> 1:25:48.181
- Cindy, I've been
looking for you.

1:25:48.215 --> 1:25:50.051
- Look at me. Focus, Greg.

1:25:50.084 --> 1:25:51.218
Come on. Look at me.

1:25:51.251 --> 1:25:52.053
- You look healthy.

1:25:52.086 --> 1:25:53.087
- Look at me.

1:25:53.121 --> 1:25:54.221
I need you to sit down.

1:25:54.989 --> 1:25:55.990
Sit down.

1:25:56.024 --> 1:25:57.357
Greg, sit down. Down.

1:25:57.391 --> 1:25:58.626
- We need to get outta here.

1:25:58.660 --> 1:25:59.927
- How was it, 213?

1:26:00.962 --> 1:26:06.166
- You're...

1:26:06.834 --> 1:26:07.735
We gotta go.

1:26:09.070 --> 1:26:09.871
Come on. Go.

1:26:09.904 --> 1:26:10.738
- Check his vitals.

1:26:11.839 --> 1:26:13.206
- Get him down.

1:26:15.677 --> 1:26:17.244
- Fuck off me!

1:26:18.178 --> 1:26:20.048
Cindy! Cindy!

1:26:27.121 --> 1:26:27.955
- Greg?

1:26:30.024 --> 1:26:31.025
Do you know where you're at?

1:26:31.059 --> 1:26:32.392
- At my apartment.

1:26:33.127 --> 1:26:34.028
- No.

1:26:34.062 --> 1:26:36.097
You're in a secret facility.

1:26:36.130 --> 1:26:37.565
You're patient 213.

1:26:37.598 --> 1:26:40.001
You've been part
of an experiment.

1:26:40.034 --> 1:26:42.070
You're the only survivor.

1:26:42.103 --> 1:26:44.237
- No, I live in 213.

1:26:44.271 --> 1:26:46.607
- No, you're part
of an experiment.

1:26:48.142 --> 1:26:48.943
- We gotta go.

1:26:48.976 --> 1:26:49.811
We gotta get to...

1:26:50.678 --> 1:26:52.180
- No.

1:26:52.212 --> 1:26:54.314
There is no "we".

1:26:54.347 --> 1:26:57.217
This has all been a part
of your imagination.

1:26:59.087 --> 1:27:00.320
- What?

1:27:01.089 --> 1:27:03.290
- Greg, she's telling
you the truth.

1:27:04.125 --> 1:27:06.094
- It's true, 213.

1:27:06.127 --> 1:27:07.061
- No.
- It's okay.

1:27:07.095 --> 1:27:09.063
- No.

1:27:09.097 --> 1:27:10.297
- He's starting to turn.

1:27:10.330 --> 1:27:11.231
Give him the pills.

1:27:14.102 --> 1:27:15.335
- Cindy!

1:27:17.171 --> 1:27:18.271
Cindy!

1:27:18.305 --> 1:27:19.941
- Abort! Abort!

1:27:19.974 --> 1:27:21.809
Project Legion has failed!

1:27:24.545 --> 1:27:25.980
Project Legion has failed!
