51:10.818 --> 51:12.403
We are.

51:12.487 --> 51:15.198
And I hope
they're wrong about Mexico.

51:15.281 --> 51:17.408
Such a disaster right
on the heels of Lagos.

51:17.492 --> 51:18.910
- [bartender] Here you go.
- Thank you.

51:18.993 --> 51:20.495
Senator...

51:20.578 --> 51:22.538
we certainly appreciate
your concern.

51:22.622 --> 51:24.040
Listen...

51:24.123 --> 51:26.083
Acting Deputy Director,

51:26.167 --> 51:28.252
I don't want to get started off
on the wrong foot here.

51:28.336 --> 51:30.797
But if I'm to take you
at your word,

51:30.880 --> 51:32.673
I think
we're after the same thing.

51:32.757 --> 51:34.592
What's that?

51:34.675 --> 51:36.302
Change.

51:46.938 --> 51:48.231
There she is.

51:48.314 --> 51:49.398
Surviving?

51:49.482 --> 51:51.442
I'm ready to leave.

51:51.526 --> 51:53.653
Wow. I know
exactly how you feel.

51:53.736 --> 51:55.112
Let me guess, senators?

51:55.196 --> 51:57.865
Lobbyists, but there are
a few bright lights.

51:57.949 --> 51:59.784
Speaking of...

51:59.867 --> 52:02.245
our host for the evening,
Ms. Zeyara Lemos.

52:02.328 --> 52:04.580
Oh, Ms. Lemos.

52:04.664 --> 52:06.749
So pleased
to finally meet you, Dr. Ryan.

52:06.833 --> 52:08.793
It's not often you get
a bona fide hero

52:08.876 --> 52:10.795
- at these things.
- Oh, I don't know about that.

52:10.878 --> 52:12.380
I mean, I think there are people
at this very table

52:12.463 --> 52:14.048
who would disagree with you.

52:14.131 --> 52:15.466
Dr. Mueller,

52:15.550 --> 52:17.051
such a pleasure.

52:17.134 --> 52:18.386
And likewise.

52:18.469 --> 52:20.179
Your support for the W.H.O.,

52:20.263 --> 52:22.974
it really means the world
to us. And...

52:23.057 --> 52:25.309
I heard about your desire
to partner.

52:25.393 --> 52:26.936
We're absolutely thrilled.

52:27.019 --> 52:29.981
Your organization means more
to me than you'll ever know.

52:30.064 --> 52:32.275
Will you be
at the relief conference?

52:32.358 --> 52:33.901
Yes, I'm actually keynote.

52:33.985 --> 52:35.903
Look for me. Front row center.

52:35.987 --> 52:37.989
- I will.
- Nice to meet you.

52:38.072 --> 52:40.741
Wow. Somebody knows everybody.

52:40.825 --> 52:43.244
- Every now and then.
- Come by my office
in the morning.

52:43.327 --> 52:44.829
I have an idea to run by you.

52:44.912 --> 52:47.164
Okay.
I'm sorry, are you leaving?

52:47.248 --> 52:49.625
Yes. My small talk quota
just got filled for the year.

52:49.709 --> 52:52.378
[both chuckle]

52:54.672 --> 52:56.549
Are you regretting
your decision to walk?

52:56.632 --> 52:58.426
No, it's beautiful.

52:58.509 --> 53:01.178
[laughs] Wright's a good
influence on you, Jack.

53:02.430 --> 53:05.224
Okay. What does she have on you?

53:06.851 --> 53:08.728
You want something real to eat?

53:08.811 --> 53:10.438
I'm up in five hours.

53:10.521 --> 53:12.565
Yeah, I really wish
you'd forget about that.

53:12.648 --> 53:14.317
I'll take a glass of water.

53:14.400 --> 53:15.818
All right.

53:15.902 --> 53:17.904
Water it is.

53:24.869 --> 53:26.537
Turn it back on.

53:26.621 --> 53:28.331
What?

53:28.414 --> 53:30.166
Turn Pluto back on.

53:30.249 --> 53:32.251
I don't know
what you're talking about.

53:32.335 --> 53:34.378
Yes, you do.

53:35.421 --> 53:37.423
You have 24 hours.
