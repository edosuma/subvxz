A magical holiday friend,

He's called the Gnome In Your
Home, and he works for Santa,

06:28.355 --> 06:31.056
by watching you all the time.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.092
According to a book
sold separately,

06:34.094 --> 06:37.062
the Gnome In Your Home
doesn't need food or sleep.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.765
He lives for just one thing:

06:39.767 --> 06:42.734
to tell Santa
if you're bad or good.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.069
(sucking pacifier rapidly)

06:44.071 --> 06:45.237
He's gonna live here
on your shelf,

06:45.239 --> 06:48.073
and he never shuts his eyes.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.074
Isn't that cute?

06:49.076 --> 06:50.442
You'd better be good,

All I wanted was to spend
the holidays with you

08:11.825 --> 08:14.025
so we could learn
more about each other.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.861
Well, I learned!

08:15.863 --> 08:17.095
Get out!

08:17.097 --> 08:19.764

What? Seriously?

08:19.766 --> 08:22.000
You really want me to go?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.802
Yes.

much better than your nonsense.

No flavor, just alcohol.

(gulps)

09:46.920 --> 09:50.088
I need something that makes me
feel better in my heart.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.723

10:04.538 --> 10:06.304
No. Jesus.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.708
He is reaching
his arms out to you.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.277
Oh, my God.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.745

10:22.222 --> 10:23.989
Yeah, it's Christmas.
(chuckles)

10:23.991 --> 10:25.757

huddling over there?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.299
The gnome can't see you.

nibble your fingers

<i>You've just watched</i>
The Simpsons.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.490
<i>Now here are a few more shows</i>
<i>to check out from Fox.</i>

21:33.626 --> 21:34.892
Yaah!
Aaah!

21:34.894 --> 21:35.993
"Blusted!"

21:35.995 --> 21:37.495
I don't know anybody
like Mickey.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.165
Buh-buh,
buh-buh-buh-buh.

21:41.167 --> 21:44.568
-Get out!
-Mickey's best qualities
are that she, uh--

21:44.570 --> 21:45.670
(slurps)

21:49.842 --> 21:53.978
<i>The Mick</i> is a show about a
not-very-well-put-together woman

21:53.980 --> 21:56.113
who is a little rough
around the edges.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.082
(screaming)
We're gonna die!
(screams)

21:58.084 --> 22:01.686
Extremely selfish.
Not super classy
or put together.

22:02.522 --> 22:05.156
Hey there.
Oh, my God. MacKenzie.

22:05.158 --> 22:08.526
I wanted to give you
an opportunity to invest
in my future.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.528
There it is.
This is the Mickey
that I know.

22:10.530 --> 22:13.698
She needs money,
and so she goes to borrow it
from her rich sister.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.533
-Suddenly, the feds bust in.
-FBI!

22:15.535 --> 22:17.702
WOMAN: FBI!

22:17.704 --> 22:20.538
Arrest the parents,
and she's stuck with
these three children.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.640
-I need you to watch
the kids tonight.
-Oh, I know!

22:22.642 --> 22:24.508
Get one of those guys
outside the hardware stores.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.378
Just act like their aunt
for one day, and I'll get you
the money that you need.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.380
Where are you?
Oh, we had to flee
the country.

22:29.382 --> 22:32.450
-What?
-When you put that character
around children

22:32.452 --> 22:34.318
who are depending on her,
that's pretty terrible.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.021
Whoa! Aaah!

22:37.023 --> 22:40.358
-I think she's dead.
-No!
-(gasps)

22:40.360 --> 22:42.526
Not the qualities
you look for in an auntie.

22:42.528 --> 22:45.363
-She's a danger
to these children.
-The kids are fine!

22:45.365 --> 22:47.365
Mickey, can I have
some more ice cream?

22:47.367 --> 22:48.899
Oh! Aaah!
