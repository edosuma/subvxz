WEBVTT

00:52.136 --> 00:53.137
Shh.

01:35.471 --> 01:38.474
Hey, there it is, gang.
Franken Castle.

01:38.849 --> 01:43.020
It's the only castle ever imported
stone by stone from Transylvania.

01:43.187 --> 01:46.816
- I can hardly wait to see inside it.
- I can wait.

01:47.024 --> 01:50.236
Remember those stories about
werewolves living in Transylvania?

01:50.486 --> 01:52.863
- Werewolves?
- Werewolves?

01:55.199 --> 01:59.370
- Look, a gypsy wagon.
- "Fortune told." Oh, let's stop.

01:59.704 --> 02:03.207
Daphne, fortunetelling
is all nonsense.

02:03.374 --> 02:07.003
Come on, let's go in. You'd like your
fortune told, wouldn't you, Scooby?

02:07.211 --> 02:11.507
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, it might be fun.

02:12.216 --> 02:15.720
So you want your fortunes told.

02:15.928 --> 02:21.225
Gather round, my pretties,
and we'll peer into the crystal ball.

02:21.517 --> 02:28.024
<i>Spirits rise and spirits fall
Reveal your secrets, tell us all</i>

02:28.774 --> 02:33.029
Ah, yes, you children
are on a pleasure trip.

02:33.738 --> 02:39.910
But what's this? I see great danger
as long as you stay in these mountains.

02:40.161 --> 02:45.249
- What kind of danger?
- Evil forces from the world of the dead.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.460
Werewolves.

02:47.752 --> 02:53.174
There are no werewolves, Scooby.
You come back here.

02:53.382 --> 02:56.218
What does your crystal ball
say about Franken Castle?

02:56.385 --> 02:57.762
That's where we're going.

02:57.970 --> 03:02.892
Not the castle. The caretaker
ran away in fear today.

03:03.184 --> 03:08.064
I warn you, you will meet
your doom if you go there.

03:09.774 --> 03:12.693
Maybe we shouldn't go to the castle.
What if she's right?

03:12.902 --> 03:18.908
Yeah, those werewolf cats come out,
like, tonight, when the moon is full.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.202
Yeah, moon is full.

03:21.577 --> 03:27.416
Nonsense, we can't let a superstitious
old gypsy scare us off.

03:31.921 --> 03:33.631
Hello, is anybody home?

03:33.839 --> 03:36.425
The gypsy said the caretaker
got scared away.

03:36.801 --> 03:41.472
What a pad for ghosts.
Well, we can't get in. Let's go home.

03:45.935 --> 03:49.063
Wait a minute. Let's get out
and look around first.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.108
Wow.

03:52.817 --> 03:57.530
Look at that.
And there's not a cloud in the sky.

04:01.283 --> 04:04.829
Looks like the caretaker came back.
Come on, let's cross.

04:04.995 --> 04:08.499
See? Everything's all right.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.710
Stop. You are not welcome in the castle.

04:12.002 --> 04:16.298
Go now or abandon all hope
of seeing the sun again.

04:16.507 --> 04:20.302
You stop that. We have permission
to visit this castle.

04:20.803 --> 04:25.141
Go. This is your last warning.

04:27.685 --> 04:29.520
It's a vampire bat.

04:29.687 --> 04:32.523
The bridge is going up. Everybody jump!

04:32.690 --> 04:37.987
- Daphne didn't make it.
- Can you get me back across? Ooh.

04:40.030 --> 04:43.659
- Zoinks! Look at that creep.
- He's after Daphne.

04:43.868 --> 04:48.164
- Run, Daphne, run!
- Don't worry, I'm running.

04:52.543 --> 04:57.047
We've gotta get across that moat.
I'II lasso that statue over the door.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.717
You and Scooby can swing over
and lower the drawbridge.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.553
- We can?
- Uh-uh. Not me.

05:03.179 --> 05:05.556
You've got to do it to save Daphne.

05:05.723 --> 05:08.350
Okay, let it go.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.188
Scooby-Doo!

05:12.563 --> 05:14.690
Hang on, Scooby.

05:14.899 --> 05:17.026
Alligator!

05:18.402 --> 05:19.570
You missed me.

05:20.362 --> 05:24.867
- They made it.
- Stand guard. I'II lower the drawbridge.

05:25.534 --> 05:26.577
Yes, sir.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.206
Who's that?

05:32.583 --> 05:36.921
I got it. You have to pull
out this locking bar.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.299
Hey, stop that
clowning around, Scooby.

05:43.052 --> 05:46.931
A werewolf. Hold this, friend.

05:47.515 --> 05:52.102
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

05:59.109 --> 06:01.904
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

06:04.532 --> 06:08.452
Scooby, we gotta hide.
I'II hide up on that window ledge.

06:08.619 --> 06:12.122
- And you hop in the piano.
- Gotcha.

06:23.801 --> 06:26.470
Time for a little ventriloquism.

06:26.929 --> 06:28.973
Where you going, fuzzy face?

06:39.567 --> 06:41.777
I'll give it to him again.

06:42.069 --> 06:46.323
You must be the big, bad wolf.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.711
Ivory piano keys?

07:07.303 --> 07:10.222
Good boy. Back him up just a little more.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.308
Now!

07:17.187 --> 07:20.316
That's just how I planned it.
Now get me down.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.320
Jump.

07:24.486 --> 07:25.863
Whee!

07:29.867 --> 07:32.828
Hurry, he's trying to get loose.

07:41.712 --> 07:44.548
I wonder where Shaggy and Scooby
could be.

07:44.715 --> 07:48.927
I don't know. But let's check out
that room up ahead.

07:49.470 --> 07:52.306
Look at that fire.
Maybe we're expected for dinner.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.684
Fine, as long as
we're not the dinner.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.811
Hey, who's that?

08:00.314 --> 08:02.399
So you didn't heed my warning?

08:02.566 --> 08:08.739
Now your spirits will dwell here
in this house forever.

08:13.744 --> 08:16.246
Duck, Velma.

08:19.708 --> 08:23.462
Hey, my glasses.
I can't see without them.

08:23.587 --> 08:26.924
They should be around here somewhere.

08:33.430 --> 08:36.350
Velma? Velma, are you all right?

08:36.934 --> 08:38.435
She's gone.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.938
But where?

08:46.694 --> 08:49.571
The coast is clear. Come on, Scooby.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.491
I think we gave old
fuzzy face the slip.

08:52.741 --> 08:58.205
- How about a snack? Check the fridge.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:59.039 --> 09:03.752
- Boy, there should be something good.
- Shaggy, come here.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.005
- What is it?
- Look.

09:07.256 --> 09:10.759
Wow, pickled vampire wings. Yuck.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.220
Werewolf snacks?

09:13.470 --> 09:16.306
Fried moonbeams? Double yuck-yuck.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.309
- What a menu.
- Yuck.

09:19.768 --> 09:24.231
You Check the pantry, and I'll look
into those canisters on the shelf.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.528
Peekaboo. It's locked.

09:31.530 --> 09:32.656
Hello?

09:33.031 --> 09:37.327
Oh, open the door. After all,
What could be in the pantry?

09:39.663 --> 09:41.331
A big one.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.625
What big one?

09:43.792 --> 09:45.502
Help, I'm falling!

09:53.761 --> 09:56.180
A white ghost. Save me.

09:59.850 --> 10:03.061
- He got me!
- It's me, Scooby.

10:14.364 --> 10:18.786
Daphne, Freddy, where are you?

10:20.078 --> 10:23.957
Shaggy, is that you over there?

10:24.291 --> 10:27.878
It must be the playroom.
There are so many interesting toys.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.590
Somebody's coming.

10:37.638 --> 10:41.225
Hey, it's an old torture chamber.
Look over there.

10:41.725 --> 10:45.020
- Yikes, it's a skeleton.
- Back upstairs.

10:45.187 --> 10:49.900
It's just an old skeleton.
He can't hurt us. Come on.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.410
- What do you smell?
- Scooby Snacks.

11:00.828 --> 11:04.873
That's ridiculous. There can't be
any Scooby Snacks down here.

11:08.710 --> 11:13.632
- See? Scooby Snacks.
- I don't believe it. Who did that?

11:14.883 --> 11:17.886
I did. I'm sure glad
you two showed up.

11:18.095 --> 11:22.391
- Shaggy, have you got my extra glasses?
- Yeah, here they are.

11:23.392 --> 11:24.726
Thanks.

11:25.561 --> 11:28.105
Now, that's better.

11:28.313 --> 11:32.401
- Oh, how did I get in this horrible room?
- I don't know, but-

11:32.609 --> 11:36.238
- Help! Help me.
- Who's that?

11:36.613 --> 11:40.242
It sounded like Daphne. Come on.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.747
It is Daphne. Down in that dungeon.

11:46.415 --> 11:47.583
What happened?

11:47.749 --> 11:50.252
A weird man chased me into this room
and locked the door.

11:53.130 --> 11:56.341
We'll get you out, Daphne.

12:03.307 --> 12:07.603
- Grab this rope, Daph.
- I have it.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.944
Stop that, you mutt.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.989
Huh? Get him, Scooby.

12:24.161 --> 12:27.122
Stop, I say. Stop it, you silly mutt.

12:27.331 --> 12:29.666
- Are you all right, Daphne?
- I'm okay.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.627
Come on, Scooby.
Let's get out of here.

12:34.421 --> 12:39.134
- Attaboy, Scooby.
- You'll pay for this.

12:39.635 --> 12:41.678
You haven't escaped me yet.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.014
Speaking of escaping,
let's get out of here.

12:44.556 --> 12:47.142
Scooby-Doo!

12:53.357 --> 12:59.071
- Man, this is dark in this tunnel.
- I can hardly see even with my glasses.

12:59.363 --> 13:02.866
Now, stay close together.
It's getting darker.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.535
Isn't that a crack of light up ahead?

13:05.702 --> 13:07.871
Yes, it is.

13:09.790 --> 13:13.043
Shaggy, you'd better lead
from now on.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.295
Shaggy? Scooby?

13:15.462 --> 13:17.965
They were right behind me,
but now they're gone.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.217
- Hey, girls.
- It's Freddy.

13:20.384 --> 13:22.844
I'm glad I found you.
What have you found out?

13:23.345 --> 13:25.180
We found Daphne in a dungeon.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.225
- And I think I found a clue.
- A clue? What is it?

13:28.517 --> 13:34.106
I wrote down a message written
on the dungeon wall in 1668. It says:

13:34.272 --> 13:38.610
"I have fooled them all. I may perish,
but I'll be as rich as King Tut."

13:38.819 --> 13:41.029
King Tut was an Egyptian.

13:41.196 --> 13:44.408
They kept their wealth after death
by having it buried with them.

13:44.616 --> 13:47.327
This calls for a visit
to the Franken crypt...

13:47.536 --> 13:51.248
but first we have
to find Scooby and Shaggy.

13:56.128 --> 14:02.634
Man, like, wow.
It's a mad scientist's rumpus room.

14:03.135 --> 14:08.015
Look in that corner. Old square-head's
taking a nap on the table. Let's get him.

14:08.432 --> 14:13.770
You jerk the sheet off, and I'll blast him
with this, and he'll be one soggy ghost.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.523
- Soggy ghost.
- Okay, all set?

14:16.732 --> 14:21.737
- Yes.
- One, two, three, go!

14:22.029 --> 14:23.613
Take that, ghost!

14:28.243 --> 14:31.747
Sorry about the free bath, Scoob.

14:36.418 --> 14:37.753
Sorry.

14:40.797 --> 14:45.469
Okay. I'm the mad scientist.
You're Igor, my assistant.

14:45.761 --> 14:50.807
We'll whip up a formula that'll
change werewolves into pussycats.

14:53.101 --> 14:57.397
Give me a shot
of that purple stuff, Igor.

14:58.857 --> 15:02.277
- Hmm? Yech. Want a sip?
- Yuck.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.200
- I call this a reject.
- Me too.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.414
BleCh.

15:28.136 --> 15:31.014
- Scary, eh, Shaggy?
- Yeah, scary.

15:31.306 --> 15:35.352
You make a good monster,
and I make a great mad doctor.

15:35.644 --> 15:38.814
Come on, I'll operate.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.691
Just hop up on the table.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.820
Now...

15:47.030 --> 15:49.991
Did you put that sheet
back on that table?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.452
Not me.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.873
- It's the real thing.
- Hey, Shaggy.

15:57.249 --> 16:00.001
- Shaggy!
- I forgot Scooby.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.130
Help. Scooby-Doo.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.864
You did it, Scooby.

16:29.030 --> 16:32.033
Now pull the sheet
out from under us.

16:32.367 --> 16:35.704
Okay, pop the chute.

16:36.371 --> 16:37.706
Scooby-Doo.

16:40.041 --> 16:43.461
Just in time. Man, what a ride.

16:43.712 --> 16:47.465
What do you mean, riding
that cart around for the fun of it?

16:47.716 --> 16:52.846
Well, since you got yourself lost,
it seemed like a good idea.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.474
This clue of Daphne's
is the only one we have.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.435
So we'll go down to the Franken crypt.

16:58.643 --> 17:02.147
- What's a crypt?
- A tomb where you bury people.

17:02.397 --> 17:06.735
- A tomb?
- Hey, come out from under that sheet.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.070
- I'm sick.
- You're not sick.

17:09.446 --> 17:12.908
Okay, Scooby, we'll leave you,
but I'd hate to be here...

17:13.074 --> 17:15.368
if those three creeps show up.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.580
Huh? Wait for me.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.960
We've searched the place,
and no sign of a clue.

17:24.169 --> 17:29.090
The date carved on this one
is the same as the clue. 1668.

17:29.257 --> 17:34.262
Shaggy, this stone lid rolls back.
Give me a hand.

17:36.973 --> 17:42.604
- Who dares disturb my sleep?
- Every man for himself!

17:49.945 --> 17:51.780
We fooled him, Scooby.

17:52.489 --> 17:56.117
If only we could set a trap
for that ghoulish ghost.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.287
- Daphne, this way.
- Back to the crypt.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.415
Hey, they're coming back.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.125
What are you doing?

18:04.459 --> 18:09.631
Use the tapestry for a trap?
Great idea.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.554
Now, Scooby.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.144
It didn't stop him.

18:28.650 --> 18:31.528
Come on, we've got him trapped.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.948
Okay, heave.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.952
- It's empty!
- What are those shiny things?

18:39.160 --> 18:43.039
A ruby, a diamond and a gold earring.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.667
I've seen this before.

18:45.834 --> 18:49.838
- Look.
- Hey, look what Scooby found.

18:50.171 --> 18:53.174
Some pearls sewn
in a piece of tapestry.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.552
That's what Daphne's clue meant.

18:55.677 --> 18:58.680
The Franken jewels
were sewn in the tapestry.

18:58.847 --> 19:02.183
- But the ghost took it away.
- But he left us this second clue.

19:02.350 --> 19:05.562
This earring resembles the one
the gypsy fortune-teller was wearing.

19:06.021 --> 19:09.983
I think we'd better
pay her another visit.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.486
I'm surprised to see you, my pretties.

19:13.695 --> 19:16.489
Did you enjoy your visit to the castle?

19:16.865 --> 19:18.700
We might ask you the same question.

19:18.867 --> 19:22.037
Me? I never go to the castle.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.832
Look, Scooby's got the tapestry.

19:26.041 --> 19:28.043
Give me that, you mutt.

19:29.377 --> 19:32.088
Get him, Scooby.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.224
Good work, Scooby.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.228
Look, a police car.

19:47.395 --> 19:51.232
The caretaker from the castle reported
there was some trouble up here.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.902
Who is this on the ground?

19:54.819 --> 19:57.906
Why, it's Big Bob Oakley,
alias The Actor.

19:58.114 --> 20:01.618
He's a master of disguises
and wanted in seven states.

20:02.077 --> 20:06.122
That explains a lot. He's been haunting
the castle to scare people away.

20:06.331 --> 20:09.918
He was after the Franken jewels
which are woven into that tapestry.

20:10.251 --> 20:13.004
Yes, and I'd have
gotten away with it too...

20:13.171 --> 20:15.256
if it wasn't for these kids
and their dog.

20:15.757 --> 20:18.176
Then you kids deserve a big thanks.

20:18.426 --> 20:22.680
I'll take Oakley and the jeweled
tapestry into custody.

20:24.140 --> 20:29.187
I don't understand how Oakley
pulled that trick with the bat.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.524
Yeah, we forgot to ask about that.

20:34.359 --> 20:37.946
There it is, the vampire bat.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.658
Save my sandwich.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.871
It's only a stuffed bat
on a wire, you guys.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.171
Huh?

20:55.296 --> 20:58.258
Scooby, I always knew
you were a little batty.

21:00.969 --> 21:03.221
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.
