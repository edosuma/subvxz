You're not listening.
I didn't say I wanted to come home.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.720
I just said it was different from
what I thought it would be.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.760
What about your roommate?
I thought you said she was cool?

00:52.680 --> 00:55.200
She's nice, but she's a junior.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.160
I thought it was gonna be all frosh.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.360
Well, ask her if you can be friends.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.640
Maybe she can show you the ropes.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.400
Yeah, maybe.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.000
She's studying our team as part of
her Psych paper so is always around.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.360
It's only been a couple of months.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.400
Give it time.
I know.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.040
Go be great.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.040
I love you.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.200
I know. I'll keep trying.
I love you too, Mom.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.640
I'm not cutting. I just wanted to
know why the line was so long.

01:39.720 --> 01:42.120
Second floor's out again.
Everyone's using this one.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.800
Broke down, like,
three times last semester.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.200
Back of the line.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.240
How about the fourth floor?

01:48.320 --> 01:49.760
Can't be worse than this.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.040
OK, thanks. I'll see you later.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.920
Sorry.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.800
Can you hold that, please?

02:00.880 --> 02:03.680

Wait, wait, wait.

but Amanda just blew it.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.960
How are you feeling?
Like I'm gonna throw up.

05:36.040 --> 05:39.520
You're not one of those people who
do better with additional pressure.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.160
Got it.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.040
Go get 'em.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.880
New record!

06:34.960 --> 06:36.760
Oh, my God, what was that?

06:36.840 --> 06:40.040
I had no idea you were so good!
Was it my pep talk?

06:40.120 --> 06:42.640
Even if it wasn't, can I say
in my paper that it was?

06:43.720 --> 06:45.760

06:49.800 --> 06:52.520

have a problem. Huh?

06:52.600 --> 06:54.960
That was my girlfriend's old record
you shattered.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.760
I'm sorry, I didn't even know
you went here.

Coach wasn't kidding when he said he
had some impressive new talent.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.800
Cody, coach is looking for you.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.920
Why don't you tell him
I'm assisting our new star?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.160
I'm here to do research,
not run your errands.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.440
Tell him yourself.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.360
Let me know if you want any
one-on-one private coaching.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.720
Beware the coach
in sheep's clothing.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.120

he's fast at.

Of course. Come on.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.840
I'm just gonna grab a shower first.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.960
All right. Meet you at Amanda's.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.040
Missed a good celebration.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.600
Yeah, I wasn't really feeling it.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.160
You all right?

09:36.560 --> 09:38.760
Um...

09:38.840 --> 09:41.240
So I was on the fifth floor,
showering.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.320
And everything was normal.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.080
And then I started, like...

09:47.360 --> 09:49.000
seeing things.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.800
Fifth floor?
Yeah, it's completely empty.

09:53.880 --> 09:57.280
Did nobody tell you that
the floor shut down?

09:57.360 --> 09:59.520
How'd you even get up there?
The elevator.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.080
I don't know, I pushed the wrong
button or something.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.920
I didn't even realise the elevator
still went up there.

10:06.760 --> 10:09.000
Look, I don't want to sound
like a drama queen,

10:10.160 --> 10:13.520
but my sister said there's a reason
they shut that bathroom down.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.840
What happened?

10:18.760 --> 10:20.760
She only heard rumours.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.040
A kid went missing or something.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.040
It's probably bullshit.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.080
Whatever it was, they shut down
the entire floor,

10:28.160 --> 10:29.720
a little over a year ago.

10:33.400 --> 10:37.080
You saw something?
You know what? No, it was nothing.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.880
You sure?
It's OK, we can talk about it.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.440
I'm just exhausted.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.840
I think I just need sleep.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.000
OK. Yeah, of course.

Now you're following me.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.640
Cool. I was just wondering...

15:00.720 --> 15:03.080
was the fifth floor open
when you went here?

15:06.160 --> 15:09.120
You stay off the fifth.
It's off-limits for real.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.200

hoping you could tell me why.

Now!

27:09.440 --> 27:10.960
OK.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.880
911, what's your emergency?

27:20.960 --> 27:23.000
I'm calling to report
a mental health crisis.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.320
Can I have your location?
Yeah, I'm at Camden...

27:25.400 --> 27:27.640
(PIPS BLEEPING)
Hello?

27:29.000 --> 27:31.480
Hello?
(SIGHS) God.

(LAUGHTER)

28:06.640 --> 28:08.360
Everybody listen up!

28:08.440 --> 28:10.400
Only two rules.

28:10.480 --> 28:14.400
Share what you've brought
and clean up what you spill.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.280
(WHOOPS)

28:55.120 --> 28:56.960
(MUSIC PLAYING)

28:59.600 --> 29:01.960
What? What are you telling her?

29:03.120 --> 29:05.680
Hey, whatever it is,
it's a bunch of crap. Got it?

29:05.760 --> 29:07.920
Don't be spreading crap.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.440
Yeah, that's what I thought.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.640
Ew! Why are you even here?

29:27.960 --> 29:29.840
Got me one?

29:32.360 --> 29:34.680
You got some serious balls
pulling that prank.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.080
What are you talking about?

29:37.160 --> 29:40.240
The picture on my car,
on all the cars.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.720
Look, I don't know what
you think you've heard,

29:42.800 --> 29:44.680
but I had nothing to do
with any of that.

29:44.760 --> 29:47.560
I don't know anything
about a picture or your car.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.640
For real?

29:53.720 --> 29:55.400
Swear.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.560
I just came here to see if I'd get

29:58.640 --> 30:01.000
some of that 101 protein
that you promised me.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.320
Do you want to get out of here?

30:21.720 --> 30:23.600
What for?

30:27.760 --> 30:29.760
I need a shower.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.600
On for a game?

30:49.680 --> 30:50.960
Like what?

30:51.800 --> 30:53.560
Like...

30:56.360 --> 30:57.840
I take the lead?

31:00.680 --> 31:03.080
Coach?
Be my guest.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.000
Where are we?

31:24.440 --> 31:27.200
