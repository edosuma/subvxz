00:01.520 --> 00:03.431
Previously, on Enterprise:

00:04.120 --> 00:05.553
Admiral Forrest has been killed.

00:06.120 --> 00:09.635
Syrrannites were responsible,
and they'll be dealt with accordingly.

00:09.760 --> 00:12.228
Your position is terminated immediately.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.075
Surak.

00:15.240 --> 00:18.437
You're seeing the past through my eyes.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.358
The culture you've come to know
isn't the one I helped to create.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.994
Syrran did something to me
before he died.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.275
He chose you.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.038
He has Surak's katra.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.192
We can't reach them
and they can't reach us.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.072
They may be in grave danger.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.232
Find what my people have lost.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.351
Find the Kir'Shara.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.549
Blanket the area.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.478
Use all necessary force.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.591
Make sure there are no survivors.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.312
You're presiding over a massacre.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.159
The High Command is planning
to attack Andoria.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.430
He's going to start an interstellar war.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.993
Set a course for Andoria.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.269
Maximum warp.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.038
And now the conclusion.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.755
The Andorians have deployed
most of their fleet...

01:00.880 --> 01:03.155
in defensive positions
around Paan Mokar.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.634
We gave them that planet
when we signed the treaty.

01:06.760 --> 01:08.716
Why would they move
their forces there?

01:08.840 --> 01:10.956
They believe
we're preparing to retake it.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.638
We've been using unmanned probes...

01:12.760 --> 01:15.433
to generate false warp signatures
in that system.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.596
Why weren't we informed of this?

01:17.720 --> 01:21.838
It's possible that Andorian agents
have penetrated the High Command.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.199
It's necessary to limit access
to this information.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.600
Our forces are actually stationed here...

01:29.720 --> 01:32.359
preparing to launch
an invasion of Andoria.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.671
There are members of the council
who are not convinced an invasion...

01:35.800 --> 01:37.836
is necessary at this time.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.556
We know they have the Xindi
technology. You've all seen the data.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.398
Data can be falsified.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.273
We received this sensor telemetry
two days ago.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.234
It was recorded by the Andorian ship
that stole the Xindi prototype.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.638
Our operatives tell us
the prototype was taken back...

02:01.760 --> 02:03.955
to Andoria where it was disassembled.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.674
We have reason
to believe the lmperial Guard...

02:06.800 --> 02:09.951
plans to equip their vessels
with similar weaponry.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.470
Do you have evidence of this?

02:12.600 --> 02:15.956
They didn't steal the prototype
because they were merely curious.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.399
I'm certain of one thing.

02:18.520 --> 02:22.229
Sooner or later, the Andorians
will make use of this technology.

02:23.200 --> 02:27.239
Is it logical for us to wait for that day?

02:32.680 --> 02:35.148
It's been a long road

02:36.800 --> 02:38.791
Gettin' from there to here

02:40.000 --> 02:42.434
It's been a long time

02:43.600 --> 02:46.797
But my time is finally near

02:47.360 --> 02:51.069
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

02:51.760 --> 02:54.479
I will touch the sky

02:54.800 --> 02:58.315
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:58.680 --> 03:01.114
No, they're not gonna change my mind

03:01.720 --> 03:05.872
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

03:06.400 --> 03:09.233
I'm going where my heart will take me

03:09.360 --> 03:12.955
I've got faith to believe

03:13.800 --> 03:16.553
I can do anything

03:16.680 --> 03:20.593
I've got strength of the soul

03:21.120 --> 03:23.918
And no one's gonna bend or break me

03:24.040 --> 03:27.669
I can reach any star

03:29.320 --> 03:31.515
I've got faith

03:33.200 --> 03:35.919
I've got faith

03:36.880 --> 03:40.350
Faith of the heart

03:42.000 --> 03:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:55.040 --> 03:57.235
We've sent word
to the Syrrannites in the mountains.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.429
They'll care for the wounded.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.596
-How far to the capital?
-Two days.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.199
We need to get back to Enterprise.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.114
Tell Starfleet what we've learned
about the embassy bombing.

04:06.320 --> 04:09.153
We have a more important mission.
We've got to get this to the capital.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.395
I don't understand.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.954
The Kir'Shara contains
Surak's original writings.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.913
It's the only surviving record
of his true teachings.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.153
It would have an enormous impact
on the High Command...

04:19.279 --> 04:20.998
and all of Vulcan.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.998
I've got two teams working on it.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.838
Both launchers should be
online in a few hours.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.234
Anything else?

04:36.160 --> 04:37.832
Permission to speak freely?

04:40.480 --> 04:43.313
Admiral Gardner ordered us
to return to Earth.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.558
Yet, we've set a course
for Andorian territory.

04:46.760 --> 04:50.230
We are going back.
We're just taking a small detour first.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.077
Have you told Starfleet you're planning
to warn the Andorians?

04:55.280 --> 04:56.235
No.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.837
Have you any idea what the Admiral
will do when he finds out?

05:01.040 --> 05:04.112
I'll save you a seat at my court-martial.
Is there anything else?

05:04.240 --> 05:07.550
The Vulcans have legitimate reasons
for launching this strike.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.956
If we alert the Andorians,
we will be betraying our closest ally.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.629
I'm trying to prevent a war, Malcolm.
A war that Earth could get drawn into.

05:14.760 --> 05:18.469
With all due respect, sir,
we shouldn't get involved.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.511
We're already involved!

05:22.240 --> 05:23.195
Come in.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.473
That'll be all, Lieutenant.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.318
-Sir?
-Dismissed.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.833
-You asked for me, Commander?
-I've been thinking.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.118
There's no guarantee the
lmperial Guard's going to believe us.

05:44.240 --> 05:47.232
We've got no evidence your people
are planning this attack.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.920
But there is one Andorian
who might trust us.

05:50.320 --> 05:53.471
-At least he does some of the time.
-Commander Shran.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.149
Problem is, I have no idea
how to find him.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.320
I may be able to help.

05:59.320 --> 05:59.399
I may be able to help.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.355
Good.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.553
Lieutenant Reed appeared unsettled.

06:07.720 --> 06:10.837
Some of the crew are wondering
if I'm doing the right thing.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.193
Can't say I blame them.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.958
I'm not so sure myself.

06:15.240 --> 06:19.028
I have no doubt Captain Archer would
pursue this same course of action.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.996
That's what I keep telling myself.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.399
Enterprise will be scanning for us
at the transport coordinates.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.709
One of us should go there.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.637
It's too dangerous.
We're staying together.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.832
Taking the artefact to the
High Command will accomplish nothing.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.712
It might be the only thing
that can stop the war.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.308
-What war?
-Between Vulcan and Andoria.

06:44.480 --> 06:48.189
We settled our dispute with
the Andorians nearly two years ago.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.431
V'Las was just stalling for time.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.994
He's been preparing
a large-scale attack ever since.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.156
Where did you get this information?

06:56.400 --> 06:57.799
Where do you think?

07:00.560 --> 07:04.109
Assuming for the moment
you possess Surak's katra...

07:04.480 --> 07:06.277
he's been dead for centuries.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.994
How could he be aware
of plans for a war?

07:09.160 --> 07:12.550
Some of Syrran's memories
must have been transferred in the meld.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.475
Captain.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.874
You think I've lost my mind?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.231
I'm not certain your mind
is the one making these decisions.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.959
We should return to the ship. T'Pau can
take the artefact to the capital.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.832
I was chosen for this.

07:30.360 --> 07:33.272
Chosen? Interesting choice of words.

07:34.360 --> 07:37.033
If I were in your shoes,
I'd be just as sceptical.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.511
I'm not possessed,
and I'm not delusional.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.553
There are forces at work
on your world right now...

07:44.680 --> 07:47.592
trying to undo everything
Surak taught your people.

07:47.840 --> 07:51.071
If we fail, Vulcan will be
consumed by them.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.789
That's why we have to get this thing
to the capital.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.911
And I'm going to need all three of us
to try and find--

07:56.040 --> 07:57.951
Archer! Don't move.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.913
Gallicite deposits. Are you in
possession of anything metallic?

08:06.080 --> 08:07.149
Just this.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.193
Thanks for the warning.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.352
Our patrol has returned.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.755
They captured eight Syrrannites
from the sanctuary.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.713
-Was Syrran among them?
-No. He is dead.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.153
The Syrrannites say that there were...

08:32.280 --> 08:34.669
three other survivors,
including a human.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.109
Archer.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.595
They say that
he is carrying the Kir'Shara.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.231
The Kir'Shara never existed.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.955
There are scholars who believe it does.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.116
And that it was hidden in The Forge.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.559
The Syrrannites claim that they are
following the true path of Surak.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.752
If the Kir'Shara is real,
it could prove them right.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.836
It doesn't exist!

08:58.240 --> 09:00.800
You've been listening
to Syrrannite propaganda.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.478
That will be all, Minister.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.394
Sublieutenant...

09:20.600 --> 09:24.752
order Major Talok
to find the remaining Syrrannites.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.793
We're dealing with radical insurgents.

09:29.800 --> 09:34.271
They're to be eradicated.
Do I make myself clear?

09:43.080 --> 09:44.229
Open a channel.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.396
-To who?
-The nebula.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.033
This is Ambassador Soval.

09:54.160 --> 09:58.039
I've come on an urgent mission.
I must speak with Commander Shran.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.511
The High Command has decrypted
your security protocols.

10:04.640 --> 10:08.189
We're well aware that your task force
has been hiding in this nebula.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.556
Maybe your information's out of date.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.598
He's in there.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.590
This is Commander Tucker
of Enterprise.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.951
We've got some information
you're gonna want to hear.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.035
Sir.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.433
We're being hailed.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.433
Commander Tucker...

10:39.320 --> 10:41.390
you have a poor choice of friends.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.840
-An invasion?
-That's correct.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.236
We keep a very close eye on your fleet.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.590
We would know if the High Command
were preparing to attack.

10:51.720 --> 10:54.075
V'Las has been assembling ships
near Regulus...

10:54.200 --> 10:56.589
beyond the range
of your listening stations.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.359
Your leaders may be fools,
but they're not suicidal.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.357
They know we will respond.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.914
They were told
you're adapting Xindi weaponry...

11:04.040 --> 11:05.792
and that you're planning
to use it against Vulcan.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.639
That's absurd! Captain Archer
destroyed the Xindi prototype...

11:08.760 --> 11:10.239
before we could examine it.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.920
That fact was conveniently omitted.

11:13.240 --> 11:17.631
You people are so used to lying, you
don't even tell the truth to each other!

11:18.240 --> 11:20.708
How do I know you weren't sent here
as a diversion?

11:20.840 --> 11:22.114
You don't.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.468
Do you have...

11:23.600 --> 11:28.276
any idea what will happen
when the lmperial Guard retaliates?

11:28.760 --> 11:31.399
It will be a disaster for both our worlds!

11:31.520 --> 11:35.035
Which is why you must convince them
to intercept our fleet.

11:36.840 --> 11:39.991
You're betraying your own people
by telling me this.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.109
I'm aware of that.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.753
Why are you doing it?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.839
The High Command is counting on
the element of surprise.

11:46.960 --> 11:51.272
If they meet resistance, I believe V'Las
will be forced to call off the invasion.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.758
When does this...

11:57.280 --> 12:00.556
-invasion begin?
-Soon.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.274
That's the best you can give me, soon?

12:03.880 --> 12:05.029
Yes.

12:06.840 --> 12:10.230
-Do you believe him, pinkskin?
-I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.114
I'll need to consult with my superiors.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.311
I suggest you do it fast.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.800
That's the fourth patrol today.

12:39.800 --> 12:40.118
That's the fourth patrol today.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.595
There's an extensive security grid
around the capital.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.597
It's unlikely we'll get past it.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.997
We'll find a way. Surak will help us.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.477
You don't believe in the katra?

12:54.480 --> 12:56.357
It's irrelevant what I believe.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.997
The Captain could be
permanently injured...

12:59.120 --> 13:00.678
if we don't get him to a doctor soon.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.995
He doesn't need a physician,
he needs a priest.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.315
One experienced with katras.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.830
It's irrational that we're following
someone in his state of mind.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.355
What if he dies before we can get help?

13:19.960 --> 13:21.359
I apologize.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.838
My mother's death has affected me
more than I realized.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.593
It was a great loss.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.991
We disagreed frequently,
but I valued her counsel.

13:34.120 --> 13:37.476
I could allow you
to experience what she shared with me.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.479
You melded with her?

13:45.520 --> 13:48.557
-I cannot meld.
-I would initiate it.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.273
That's not what I mean.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.394
I was forced...

13:55.680 --> 13:58.194
to participate in a meld
several years ago.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.268
I was infected with a neural disease.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.188
Pa'nar Syndrome.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.512
Do you still suffer from it?

14:07.320 --> 14:08.594
There's no cure.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.394
Another lie perpetrated
by the High Command.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.715
Pa'nar has been known
since Surak's time.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.437
It's caused by melders
who have been improperly trained.

14:19.120 --> 14:22.749
One with great experience
can correct the neurological imbalance.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.677
Is there something you can do?

14:34.480 --> 14:36.072
My mind to your mind...

14:37.360 --> 14:39.396
my thoughts to your thoughts...

14:41.080 --> 14:42.911
our minds are merging...

14:46.520 --> 14:48.272
our minds are one.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.714
-Bridge to Commander Shran.
-This is Shran.

14:56.840 --> 15:00.230
We've isolated the Vulcan's
bio-signature. He's alone.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.954
You're certain Enterprise won't detect
the transport?

15:03.080 --> 15:07.119
All they'll see is a brief energy surge.
They'll think it came from the nebula.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.199
Commander?

15:11.400 --> 15:13.789
-Energize when ready.
-Yes, sir.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.476
Welcome aboard, Ambassador.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.432
If you're expecting me to plead
for mercy, you'll be waiting a long time.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.472
I simply want to know
your fleet's actual location.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.192
I've already given it to you.

15:36.320 --> 15:39.710
Then consider this our way of
confirming what you've told us.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.557
You didn't expect the lmperial Guard
to mobilize its entire fleet...

15:43.680 --> 15:47.434
based on nothing more than
the word of one loyal Vulcan diplomat?

15:47.760 --> 15:51.833
We spent weeks arguing over details
in our treaty negotiations.

15:51.960 --> 15:55.396
-Did I ever mislead you?
-No.

15:57.120 --> 16:01.113
You must know that torture
is rarely effective against Vulcans.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.399
Our mental disciplines allow us
to suppress pain.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.114
Our security division has had
a great deal of experience...

16:07.240 --> 16:10.630
extracting information
from Vulcan operatives.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.672
This machine
doesn't cause physical discomfort.

16:13.920 --> 16:18.471
It uses a neuro-synaptic field
to lower your emotional threshold.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.953
How do you feel?

16:33.440 --> 16:37.718
I've seen Vulcans
who were broken by this device.

16:38.200 --> 16:42.751
They were never the same again. I have
no desire to see that happen to you.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.952
-Where is your fleet?
-I told you.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.230
Our ships are assembling
near Regulus.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.796
-Release me!
-I can't.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.514
Not until I'm certain
you've told us the truth.

16:57.920 --> 17:01.515
Then I suggest you increase
the setting and get this over with!

17:09.400 --> 17:12.472
-What is it?
-The Ambassador seems to be missing.

17:12.680 --> 17:15.240
He's not in his quarters
or anywhere on D-Deck.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.317
Tucker to Soval.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.556
Ambassador, please respond.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.551
Internal sensors, scan for his bio-signs.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.799
He's not on board.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.272
Scan the Andorian ships.

17:36.520 --> 17:39.512
There's a Vulcan signature
on their lead ship.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.279
Go to Tactical Alert. Open a channel.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.033
This is Commander Tucker.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.594
We know Ambassador Soval's
aboard your ship.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.711
I want to speak with him now.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.635
Sir, the Andorians are moving toward
the nebula.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.069
Target Shran's ship.
Disable the engines.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.471
Navigation just went off-line.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.512
It's the particle flux in the nebula.
It's overloading the sensors.

18:12.640 --> 18:13.629
I've lost them.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.671
Can we compensate for the flux?

18:16.720 --> 18:20.076
It'll take a few hours.
You have the Bridge.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.671
Captain, you need to rest.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.439
Thanks, but I'll be fine.

18:30.560 --> 18:33.074
The atmosphere is thinner
than you're used to.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.589
If you don't stop soon, you'll collapse.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.792
If you need a break, T'Pol,
you should say so.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.672
I'm going to scout ahead.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.235
Have you had any more conversations
with Surak?

18:51.440 --> 18:53.158
Not in a couple of hours.

18:56.120 --> 18:57.519
Something's amusing?

18:57.880 --> 19:00.599
Of all the people
who could have carried this katra.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.755
I doubt you were Syrran's first choice.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.518
Ever since the meld...

19:05.960 --> 19:08.713
I've felt more centred.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.753
It's hard to explain.

19:13.160 --> 19:17.711
My whole life,
I've never really understood Vulcans.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.713
Why they work so hard
to suppress their emotions.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.397
Now it all seems to make sense.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.753
Next thing you know,
I'll be taking up meditation.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.635
You might find it beneficial.

19:33.160 --> 19:34.559
After we get back...

19:35.440 --> 19:39.115
maybe you'll want to take a closer look
at the Syrrannites' philosophy.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.319
-Why?
-lt was important to your mother.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.917
There might be something to it.

19:46.320 --> 19:49.995
There are many groups who claim
to follow the true path of Surak.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.270
I find no evidence
that this one's any different.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.517
I would've thought you'd be
more sympathetic to their cause.

19:57.120 --> 20:00.078
You never seemed too happy
with the status quo around here.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.794
I may have had disagreements
with the High Command...

20:02.920 --> 20:05.957
but that doesn't mean
I'm going to join a radical faction.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.351
You signed up with Starfleet.

20:09.320 --> 20:12.278
A lot of Vulcans I've met consider us
a radical faction.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.953
As a scientist...

20:16.400 --> 20:18.311
I just thought you might want
to keep an open mind--

20:18.440 --> 20:20.192
This has nothing to do with science!

20:20.320 --> 20:21.594
Am I interrupting?

20:25.440 --> 20:26.589
No.

20:39.280 --> 20:39.480
-Let me out of here!
-I can't.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.755
-Let me out of here!
-I can't.

20:41.880 --> 20:45.953
-I'm sorry. Not yet.
-I'll tear the antennae from your skull!

20:46.200 --> 20:48.077
If this interrogation continues...

20:48.200 --> 20:51.510
your suppression system
could be permanently damaged!

20:51.640 --> 20:53.039
Tell me what I want to know!

20:53.160 --> 20:55.276
Aren't you enjoying this, Commander?

20:55.840 --> 20:59.355
Have you imagined having me
in this chair many times?

20:59.920 --> 21:01.717
That's not far from the truth.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.313
But after our rather
lengthy peace talks...

21:06.080 --> 21:09.436
-I came to trust you.
-Then trust me now!

21:09.600 --> 21:14.230
-You would never betray your people!
-I'm trying to save them!

21:18.120 --> 21:20.076
Where is your fleet?

21:24.440 --> 21:26.510
Do you know the story of Nirak?

21:27.920 --> 21:28.989
What?

21:29.120 --> 21:31.429
He was a soldier
who lived a long time ago.

21:32.400 --> 21:36.518
He was standing watch
over the gates of the city of Gol...

21:36.640 --> 21:39.757
and he saw a cloud on the horizon
moving toward him.

21:41.080 --> 21:44.072
He thought it was a sandstorm,
so he told no one.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.830
It was an army.

21:47.400 --> 21:51.473
They destroyed the city,
but they let Nirak live.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.956
His name now means fool
in our language.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.719
Just as yours will in Andorian!

22:11.320 --> 22:14.630
Give the Kir'Shara to us.
You won't be injured.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.995
This isn't your world, human.

23:17.440 --> 23:18.429
Archer!

23:18.720 --> 23:20.756
Surrender and you won't be harmed.

23:22.120 --> 23:23.553
I'm not leaving her.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.952
-What the hell were you doing?
-Protecting the Kir'Shara.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.995
Where are they taking the Kir'Shara?

24:24.320 --> 24:25.548
Mount Seleya.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.435
Why?

24:27.560 --> 24:31.109
Because the artefact contains
Surak's original writings.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.034
Only the priests on Seleya
can translate them.

24:35.280 --> 24:39.671
-lf you are deceiving me--
-I am a Syrrannite. We don't lie.

24:56.800 --> 24:57.949
I need to rest.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.789
If you're attempting to delay us,
it won't work. We'll find your friends.

25:10.280 --> 25:11.429
You've changed.

25:12.920 --> 25:15.275
I served under you
during the Tomed Mission.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.998
-You don't remember me.
-That's a very long time ago.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.916
You were a fine officer then.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.478
Why did you betray us?

25:26.120 --> 25:28.236
They must have offered you something.

25:28.720 --> 25:31.075
Or perhaps you enjoy hiding bombs
in embassies.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.599
We weren't responsible.

25:32.720 --> 25:34.995
Two of my men were killed
in the embassy explosion.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.519
You have been misled.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.078
Syrrannites are peaceful.

25:39.400 --> 25:42.233
I have spared your life
because you were once my superior.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.510
Your companions won't be so fortunate.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.594
-Bridge to Commander Shran.
-What is it?

25:49.720 --> 25:51.995
The General is asking for an update
on the interrogation.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.997
T ell him I'll contact him when I'm ready.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.075
Acknowledged.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.757
You find this amusing?

26:01.960 --> 26:05.589
Ordinarily I wouldn't, but,
because of this device.

26:06.640 --> 26:10.758
There are three higher settings
on that panel.

26:11.240 --> 26:12.719
If I use them....

26:14.400 --> 26:16.470
You're afraid to injure me.

26:17.720 --> 26:21.395
If I were you, I'd leave that detail
out in your report to the General.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.509
Where is your fleet?

26:24.960 --> 26:27.315
I was a fool to think you'd listen.

26:27.800 --> 26:32.476
Perhaps the High Command was right,
we'll be better off when Andoria falls.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.275
-Report!
-It's the Starfleet ship.

26:37.920 --> 26:41.151
-Direct hit to their shield generator.
-See if you can get a lock on Soval.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.039
Should we return fire?

26:44.640 --> 26:47.438
Are you going to make enemies
of the humans as well?

26:53.200 --> 26:56.158
Lieutenant, order our ships
out of the nebula.

26:56.280 --> 26:57.872
-Commander?
-And tell Enterprise...

26:58.000 --> 27:00.036
we'll be returning
the Ambassador shortly.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.470
-Understood.
-Get that thing off of him.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.712
They're heading east,
away from the capital.

27:17.320 --> 27:18.594
She's with them.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.356
-Where are you going?
-To find my Science Officer.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.869
I don't want to hear any lectures
about the needs of the many.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.956
I get enough of that crap from....

27:29.840 --> 27:30.909
From T'Pol.

27:31.520 --> 27:34.956
There's no logic to your plan.
We have no weapons.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.514
If they take the Kir'Shara from you,
they'll destroy it.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.119
I'm going to find her.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.149
How is he?

27:57.400 --> 27:59.630
You've got a lot of nerve pretending
you give a damn.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.557
I did what was necessary.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.234
Soval would understand.

28:04.720 --> 28:07.359
He should be fine in another day or so.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.277
He risked his life coming here.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.356
And you paid him back
by scrambling his neurons.

28:11.480 --> 28:13.596
He is not the only one taking a risk.

28:14.280 --> 28:18.796
I just spoke with the lmperial Guard.
They're redeploying our forces.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.998
Now you believe him.
What changed your mind?

28:25.520 --> 28:29.559
A lesser man would have told me what
I wanted to hear, even if it wasn't true.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.758
There's been too much suspicion...

28:32.880 --> 28:35.952
too many lies, on both sides.

28:38.640 --> 28:42.110
Our fleet will intercept the Vulcans
at these coordinates.

28:42.680 --> 28:45.353
My superiors believe it may be...

28:45.960 --> 28:48.235
helpful if Enterprise were to join us.

28:55.920 --> 28:56.875
Sehlat.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.796
My First Officer, where is she?

29:31.320 --> 29:33.038
What have you done with her?

29:33.600 --> 29:36.797
She's been taken to the High Command.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.551
Your technique has improved.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.793
Welcome home, Subcommander.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.199
I no longer hold that rank.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.517
Well, you may have joined Starfleet,
but you're still Vulcan.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.116
And subject to our laws.

30:08.600 --> 30:12.115
There are few crimes still punishable
by execution...

30:12.240 --> 30:14.959
but treason is one of them.

30:16.800 --> 30:17.755
What is it?

30:18.320 --> 30:22.438
Seven alien ships have taken position
outside the Andorian system.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.949
They're directly in the path of our fleet.

30:31.720 --> 30:32.948
Are you sure this is wise?

30:33.080 --> 30:36.356
If the Vulcans find us here, they might
think we're siding with the Andorians.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.436
There's no guarantee
they won't fire on us.

30:38.560 --> 30:41.472
Sir, I'm reading a massive
subspace distortion.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.591
-Hoshi?
-It's the Vulcans.

30:43.720 --> 30:45.472
They'll be here in two hours.

30:46.120 --> 30:48.156
-He's hailing us again.
-On screen.

30:50.120 --> 30:53.157
Our sensors show 12 Vulcan
cruisers approaching.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.157
When will the rest
of your fleet get here?

30:55.280 --> 30:58.192
They won't arrive in time.
We're on our own.

31:05.960 --> 31:09.555
I'm still not clear how the Kir'Shara
is going to stop a war.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.758
V'Las can't govern without approval
from the Council.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.429
The existence of the Kir'Shara
will persuade them...

31:15.560 --> 31:17.357
to reconsider their support.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.156
I don't suppose they'll let us
just walk into the High Command.

31:25.680 --> 31:28.319
We can transport in,
but we'll need access codes.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.036
I know someone who might have them.

31:43.640 --> 31:46.234
The Vulcans are powering weapons.
The Andorians are doing the same.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.396
Travis, put us between both fleets.

31:49.320 --> 31:50.673
If the Vulcans want to start a war...

31:50.800 --> 31:53.519
they're going to have
to get through us first.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.115
It's Shran.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.353
Commander,
what do you think you're doing?

31:59.480 --> 32:01.789
In case you hadn't noticed,
they outnumber us two to one!

32:01.920 --> 32:04.798
-Get back in formation.
-I'm trying to buy us some time!

32:10.280 --> 32:12.840
The Andorians have more ships
on the way.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.832
They won't arrive for several hours.

32:15.200 --> 32:18.112
You told us
this strike would be a surprise.

32:18.320 --> 32:21.278
That there would be minimal casualties
on both sides.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.995
The Andorians are armed
with standard particle-cannons.

32:25.120 --> 32:28.032
There is no evidence
of Xindi technology.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.514
Administrator...

32:31.120 --> 32:33.031
we have to call off this attack.

32:34.440 --> 32:36.078
Our forces are committed.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.233
We can't turn back.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.269
We're being hailed by the Starfleet ship.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.152
This is Commander Tucker.

32:44.280 --> 32:47.590
Sorry to spoil your surprise, but the
Andorians know what you're planning.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.870
I suggest you turn
your ships around now.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.831
This doesn't concern Starfleet.

32:52.280 --> 32:55.158
-Leave the area immediately.
-I can't do that.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.510
The Andorians helped us
when Earth was under attack.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.153
We're just here to return the favour.

32:59.280 --> 33:02.317
If you side with the Andorians,
you'll be fired upon.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.556
I've already sent word
to Admiral Gardner.

33:04.680 --> 33:08.434
If Enterprise is destroyed, Starfleet's
going to know who is responsible.

33:10.160 --> 33:13.914
Order our ships to engage
the enemy fleet.

33:14.040 --> 33:17.430
Administrator, I can't allow this.

33:17.720 --> 33:18.869
Sublieutenant.

33:20.120 --> 33:22.953
If you attempt to interfere again...

33:24.320 --> 33:25.912
I'll have you arrested.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.675
The Vulcans, they're locking weapons.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.598
-On us?
-No. Just the Andorians.

33:35.720 --> 33:39.156
Stand by phase-cannons.
Don't fire until I give the order.

33:52.040 --> 33:53.189
We're in the crossfire!

33:53.320 --> 33:55.117
Hard about.
Get us out of their weapons range.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.879
One of the Andorian ships is in trouble.
Their reactor's been hit.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.752
A Vulcan cruiser's heading
towards them.

33:59.880 --> 34:01.916
See if you can get their attention.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.594
The Earth vessel's opened fire
on one of our ships.

34:05.720 --> 34:06.948
Destroy them.

34:07.400 --> 34:10.630
-The cruiser's breaking off its attack.
-We're being targeted.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.429
Evasive starboard. Full impulse.

34:13.840 --> 34:14.829
Malcolm!

34:14.960 --> 34:16.632
We're not making
a dent in their shields.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.194
Shran's hailing.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.839
Tell Archer that's two he owes me.

34:49.199 --> 34:52.272
-Contact Security!
-Stay where you are.

34:52.719 --> 34:53.947
We need to have a talk.

34:54.080 --> 34:57.356
Administrator, it is agreeable
to see you again.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.993
This woman is an anarchist, Captain.

35:02.840 --> 35:07.595
-Whatever she's told you isn't the truth.
-T'Pau didn't bomb our embassy.

35:09.840 --> 35:10.875
You did.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.755
-The evidence is conclusive.
-Evidence your people gave us.

35:16.840 --> 35:20.913
The bombing was an excuse
to round up the Syrrannites...

35:21.040 --> 35:23.634
make certain they'd never find this.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.314
Is that....

35:33.120 --> 35:34.997
The Kir'Shara is a myth!

36:00.960 --> 36:02.598
-Hull plating's gone!
-Torpedoes!

36:02.720 --> 36:04.517
The launchers aren't responding.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.518
-Where the hell is Shran?
-The Vulcans are keeping him busy.

36:08.680 --> 36:10.671
Looks like we really are on our own.

36:10.800 --> 36:14.156
Holographic trickery.
This proves nothing.

36:14.360 --> 36:17.113
The artefact must be examined in detail.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.229
No.

36:18.360 --> 36:21.477
Quantum dating will confirm
that it's from the time of Surak.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.113
You can't trust her!

36:23.320 --> 36:25.754
She'd do anything
to spread her deviant beliefs.

36:25.880 --> 36:27.871
You've spent years trying to subvert me.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.195
The Kir'Shara will show us
our true path.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.629
They'd kill us all if they had the chance!

36:33.360 --> 36:35.316
It must be destroyed!

36:40.400 --> 36:44.473
This is Minister Kuvak. Get me
the Fleet Commander immediately.

36:47.880 --> 36:51.190
-I've lost helm control.
-Hull breach on G-Deck.

36:51.320 --> 36:52.958
We're venting atmosphere.

37:00.520 --> 37:03.717
The Vulcan ships, they're withdrawing.

37:05.280 --> 37:08.033
We're being hailed.
It's the High Command.

37:10.920 --> 37:14.913
-Trip, is everything all right?
-More or less.

37:15.680 --> 37:19.389
-What's going on, Captain?
-There've been a few changes here.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.870
Get back to Vulcan as soon as you can.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.996
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

37:26.120 --> 37:29.317
Administrator V'Las has been relieved
of his position.

37:29.440 --> 37:32.238
His role in the embassy bombing
is being investigated.

37:32.360 --> 37:35.670
For the moment, the conflict
between Vulcan and Andoria...

37:35.800 --> 37:37.552
appears to have been averted.

37:38.560 --> 37:39.515
Enter.

37:42.520 --> 37:45.159
Captain Archer asked me
to express his gratitude.

37:46.040 --> 37:48.873
He wouldn't have succeeded
without your transporter codes.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.195
The Captain told me
you were in danger.

37:51.760 --> 37:54.832
I wouldn't have been
a very good husband if I didn't help.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.349
I'm not certain
when I'll be able to return.

37:58.240 --> 37:59.832
I'm aware that I promised your family...

37:59.960 --> 38:01.439
that we would eventually live together.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.152
That's not why I've come.

38:03.720 --> 38:05.756
I'm releasing you from our marriage.

38:06.920 --> 38:09.639
I know you only bonded with me
to help your mother.

38:10.360 --> 38:14.717
She's gone now.
There's no reason for us to continue.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.394
-You don't have to do this.
-I know.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.473
Koss.

38:27.280 --> 38:28.508
Goodbye, T'Pol.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.670
The katra is with me now.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.392
How do you feel, Captain?

38:57.360 --> 38:59.316
Like a giant weight's been lifted.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.715
Word has already
spread of the discovery.

39:02.480 --> 39:05.313
It may take years
to translate all of the writings.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.954
The people of Vulcan are in your debt.

39:09.480 --> 39:12.517
Peace and long life.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.995
You may be witnessing
the start of a new era...

39:20.120 --> 39:22.839
not only for Vulcan,
but for Earth as well.

39:23.240 --> 39:26.915
The Minister intends to pursue a less
aggressive policy toward your people.

39:27.040 --> 39:29.190
The High Command will be dissolved.

39:29.560 --> 39:31.869
You'll no longer have us
looking over your shoulder.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.275
It's time for Earth to stand on its own.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.359
We're ready.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.876
You've failed!

39:45.000 --> 39:46.592
Decades of work have been lost.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.870
Am I to be blamed
for your incompetence?

39:49.000 --> 39:50.228
Archer should have been killed!

39:50.360 --> 39:54.273
You brought the humans into this.
I must leave Vulcan.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.879
My position here
has been compromised.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.150
-What about me?
-Not now.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.589
Your disappearance
would cause suspicion.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.352
This is simply a minor delay.

40:03.880 --> 40:07.475
The reunification of our people
is only a matter of time.
