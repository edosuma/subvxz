WEBVTT

04:22.304 --> 04:23.670
Body of Christ.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.677
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.272
- Make sure he gets there.
- Yes, sir.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.753
- You stay here with me.
- Yes, sir.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.657
Uh, Captain Roberts,
we've been looking for you.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.654
Corporal, can you run ahead and get
Sergeant Richardson for me, please?

04:41.740 --> 04:43.276
Yes, sir.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.200
Well, you got any good news for me?

04:46.286 --> 04:49.279
I'm afraid not. You are headed
into the thick of it.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.785
- All right, what are the numbers?
- Forty or 50 fighters.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.186
What kind of support do they have?

04:53.210 --> 04:56.203
There's three machine guns interspaced
with interlocking fields of fire,

04:56.296 --> 04:58.162
mortars in the middle for support.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.748
All right, sounds like
we got some trouble.

05:00.842 --> 05:04.256
But if you hit the trenches with grenades,
keep on going down the line,

05:04.346 --> 05:06.804
the Germans are spread thin.
It'll confuse them.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.517
Ammo, check for the platoon,
make sure everyone has enough.

05:11.603 --> 05:12.935
Yes, sir.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.435
Now wait a minute.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.858
Are you sending the 365th to be our flank?

05:18.944 --> 05:21.482
- The Buffalo Soldiers?
- Yeah, with them on the left,

05:21.571 --> 05:23.800
we'll press through German lines
and secure the objective.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.593
Wait, wait, wait,
do they have combat training?

05:25.617 --> 05:28.781
Does that matter? Is this a problem?

05:28.870 --> 05:31.237
Well, if they don't have
combat training, yeah, Allen.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.947
I mean, they're... they're green.

05:36.002 --> 05:40.121
Look, I know that we don't share
the same belief on the black soldiers,

05:40.215 --> 05:43.879
but these boys can fight. They're ready.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.804
All right.

05:48.890 --> 05:52.133
- You okay?
- Yeah.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.219
Just a little shaky.

05:55.856 --> 05:59.190
- What am I about to drink?
- That's brandy, my friend.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.359
You and your goddamn brandy.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.152
Oh, and you were not lying.

06:09.619 --> 06:10.619
Hey, happy hunting.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.296
You okay, Will?

06:33.810 --> 06:34.891
Yeah.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.053
A little shaky.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.356
It'll pass.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.058
The men are ready.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.145
Shall we?

06:47.365 --> 06:50.278
Yeah. Yeah, let's get it over with.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.333
Keep your heads down out there!

07:02.339 --> 07:05.423
The steel rain will soon pass.

07:05.508 --> 07:08.046
Don't give the Hun bastards
an easy one.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.377
This is it.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.095
The time you've trained for.

07:12.182 --> 07:16.677
The moment we prepared for.
You are all ready!

07:18.063 --> 07:19.063
It's okay.

07:19.147 --> 07:22.606
Let it out, let it out. Let it out.
Okay. Good.

- Fix bayonets!

08:03.817 --> 08:06.025
Fix bayonets!

08:14.077 --> 08:18.447
This is it, lads.
I'll see you on the other side.

08:23.545 --> 08:24.956
Good luck, sir.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.669
Sir!

09:56.763 --> 09:59.096
- Are you hit, sir?
- No, no, no, I can't do this.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.970
- What? No!
- I can't do it! I can't do it!

10:02.060 --> 10:05.599
- No, no! No!
- I can't... Let me go! I can't...

10:05.688 --> 10:06.768
Snap out of it!

10:31.631 --> 10:34.294
Will! Will, over here.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.297
Keep moving!

10:41.015 --> 10:43.974
You fellas stay on my ass
and don't stop.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.267
Keep moving forward!

10:45.353 --> 10:47.470
My leg!

10:47.564 --> 10:49.931
- Someone help.
- No, you stay there.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.200
- Who's your platoon leader?
- You are now, sir.

11:11.504 --> 11:15.043
Oh, Lord, I'm alive.
Thank you, Jesus.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.013
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Good to see you, Sergeant.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.801
- Just out for a stroll.
- Do you know where we are?

11:19.888 --> 11:21.470
Not any place
I want to stay very long.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.931
They're tearing us to shreds.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.431
So I guess
it will have to be a hell of a plan.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.814
- Did you see anyone else?
- Everyone else is pinned down or dead.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.320
Got a field radio?
We got a field radio?!

11:41.409 --> 11:42.900
Didn't make it.

11:42.994 --> 11:46.158
Get me a runner. Runner! Runner!

11:46.247 --> 11:47.783
Get down, get down.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.623
Listen, we've reached the other side.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.827
Guns are not destroyed.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.459
Objective in question. Stay low. Go.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.049
- Shit! I need another runner.
- No. No, no.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.461
- Sir, it's getting pretty hot here.
- Okay.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.841
They have our position, sir.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.140
- We need to move.
- Okay. Uh... All right.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.626
Get grenades.
Get your grenades out.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.079
- Grenades!
- Grenades!

12:09.103 --> 12:12.938
Wait for a barrel change,
toss grenades and then go.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.603
On my signal.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.154
Now!

12:21.407 --> 12:23.247
Move! Go, go, go!

12:32.502 --> 12:34.494
You good?

12:34.587 --> 12:37.546
Yeah. But man,
my feet are killing me, though.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.089
- Quit talking.
- Oh, shit!

12:41.761 --> 12:43.593
Jesus.

12:45.515 --> 12:48.115
- Where you been?
- This bitch weighs a ton.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.634
Let's go, guys. Come on.
Come on. Through the back.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.389
We got a machine gun
and support crews.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.725
We gotta take out those guns.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.898
Kirby, Pinchelli, grenades.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.823
Quinn, Cardinni...

13:46.909 --> 13:48.525
you follow me after the blast.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.219
We'll leapfrog to the end of the trench.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.390
Where do you want me, sir?

13:51.414 --> 13:53.497
- Just watching our backs.
- Right.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.370
Kirby, Pinchelli.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.456
You're up.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.253
Watch it. Watch it.

14:02.925 --> 14:03.925
Go!

14:33.247 --> 14:35.207
Here they come!

15:16.541 --> 15:18.123
Hey, Mick, you want in on this?

15:18.209 --> 15:21.202
- I don't strip the dead.
- You're a fool and you're Irish.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.774
- Just leave me alone.
- You all right, O'Malley?

15:25.925 --> 15:27.416
Holy shit!

15:28.678 --> 15:31.762
Card, get a load of that.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.464
A Luger.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.802
How come you're always getting
the good stuff?

15:37.895 --> 15:39.306
Just lucky, I guess.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.871
For Christ sake,
who did he kill for that?

15:57.957 --> 16:00.745
Hey, nothing's sacred anymore.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.804
Snap out of it!

16:43.836 --> 16:44.917
Sir?

16:47.173 --> 16:49.961
Trench is secure, sir.

16:50.051 --> 16:54.921
Thank you, Corporal. Um...
You send a runner?

16:55.932 --> 16:57.514
Yes, sir.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.182
Okay. Any other news?

16:59.268 --> 17:03.512
The Huns are licked. Ahem.
Regiment's pouring in from all over.

17:03.606 --> 17:06.644
- We own this ground.
- Thank you, Corporal. Thank you.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.362
There's something else?

17:16.452 --> 17:18.034
Uh...

17:19.247 --> 17:23.287
Yes. I mean, no, sir.

17:24.292 --> 17:27.752
- It's been a long day.
- Okay.

17:27.838 --> 17:31.297
Corporal, why don't we go see
if we can find some real food?

17:33.344 --> 17:35.381
- Sir.
- Sergeant, Corporal.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.493
Colonel, there's something I think
you should know about.

18:49.587 --> 18:50.919
What is it?

18:51.005 --> 18:53.213
We've broken
through the German lines at Argonne.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.754
- Has this been confirmed?
- Yes, twice.

19:00.431 --> 19:03.094
"D company of the 365th regiment

19:03.184 --> 19:06.473
has pushed six miles east of the last
known German front line.

19:06.562 --> 19:10.727
Last reported 0700 have not had further
contact." What is this?

19:10.816 --> 19:13.559
The 365th is a colored unit.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.942
Reports assume the company
has been cut off or lost.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.446
- They're trapped?
- Seems like it, sir.

19:22.495 --> 19:26.614
Sir, they are on the flanks
of the 77th Liberty division.

19:27.958 --> 19:31.247
- Widdle C's division?
- Yes, sir.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.875
- Has this hit the papers?
- Not yet, sir.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.802
I've got to tell the General.
Come with me.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.516
Has there been any contact?

19:53.234 --> 19:57.945
- None so far, sir.
- We wanted to bring it to you right away.

20:02.993 --> 20:06.202
My second army has been making
major advances in the Argonne

20:06.288 --> 20:08.405
and these boys have done it.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.991
Permission to speak freely, sir.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.671
Please speak freely, Colonel.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.261
When the ceasefire commences...

20:24.598 --> 20:26.635
the last German position
held by the allies

20:26.726 --> 20:29.264
will become the new
French occupied country.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.900
What are you asking of me?

20:36.986 --> 20:38.443
Well...

20:39.655 --> 20:40.862
it's kind of complicated, sir.

20:40.948 --> 20:44.441
You see, on the one hand,
those boys could be heroes.

20:44.535 --> 20:50.076
Now, it would sure boost morale back home
with the coloreds, but on the other...

20:51.167 --> 20:53.250
The Germans are going to want
that hill back.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.577
Yes, they will, sir.

20:56.839 --> 21:01.800
That could be a publicity nightmare...
if they all get killed.

21:04.722 --> 21:07.465
Any update on their status?
Do we know if they're alive or dead?

21:07.558 --> 21:09.550
None so far, sir.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.686
Hmm.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.101
Ahem. I'd like to read you something.

21:21.864 --> 21:22.864
Ahem.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.044
"Negroes,

21:38.130 --> 21:41.669
like other people,
act upon motives.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.378
Why should they do anything for us

21:47.389 --> 21:49.506
if we will not do anything for them?

21:51.143 --> 21:53.430
If they stake their life for us,

21:54.438 --> 21:58.102
they must be prompted
by the strongest motive...

21:59.693 --> 22:02.060
even the promise of freedom.

22:02.154 --> 22:06.899
And the promise, being made,
is a promise that must be kept.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.403
One day peace will come.

22:12.414 --> 22:15.748
And then there will be
some black men

22:15.835 --> 22:18.794
who can remember that,
with silent tongue, and clenched teeth,

22:18.879 --> 22:23.089
and steady eye,
and well-poised bayonet,

22:23.175 --> 22:26.794
they have helped mankind
on to this great consummation.

22:28.931 --> 22:31.969
While, I fear,
there may be some white men...

22:33.394 --> 22:35.056
unable to forget...

22:36.397 --> 22:39.981
that with malignant heart
and deceitful speech...

22:42.611 --> 22:44.273
they strove to hinder it.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.194
Yours very truly, A. Lincoln."

22:49.451 --> 22:50.532
Ahem.

22:53.581 --> 22:58.076
Alive or dead, these boys have...
they've done a lot in this war.

22:59.962 --> 23:02.329
What we're going to do
is we're going to find them...

23:04.008 --> 23:06.250
and we're going
to get them down off that hill.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.050
Well, is that it?

23:12.141 --> 23:16.101
Is that all they could muster?
They are off-time, man.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.519
And the target.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.558
They have nothing to add to it.

23:22.651 --> 23:25.064
I want results, not excuses.

23:25.154 --> 23:27.316
If you don't have them boys
from the 369th,

23:27.406 --> 23:29.384
get that artillery to the front.
There will be hell to pay!

23:29.408 --> 23:31.741
Okay? We have had too many casualties.
Now make it happen.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.113
That's an order!

23:35.122 --> 23:39.492
Artillery was supposed
to get us a walking path into this sector,

23:39.585 --> 23:43.124
but they haven't been able to hit a thing.
Can you believe that?

23:44.131 --> 23:46.965
They haven't hit a target
in this goddamn war.

23:47.051 --> 23:48.542
How did you manage?

23:48.636 --> 23:52.095
Well, we, uh, we cleared out
sector three here, sir.

23:52.181 --> 23:55.800
Actually that's where we ran into those
colored soldiers from the 365th,

23:55.893 --> 23:59.261
that platoon, nobody seems to know
where those guys are.

23:59.355 --> 24:03.019
Also, um, the...
the boys from the 40th, they...

24:03.108 --> 24:05.270
they don't have enough training, sir.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.227
Some of them didn't even have rifles.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.273
Resistance?

24:11.367 --> 24:14.735
Yeah, there are machine guns
that we had to get by.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.628
I mean, they were spread out
evenly throughout

24:16.664 --> 24:20.658
and we had to dig in
and work the trenches one by one.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.868
I used the whole goddamn platoon.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.834
Casualties?

24:28.676 --> 24:30.087
Casualties.

24:31.553 --> 24:32.553
Yeah.

24:36.892 --> 24:37.892
Yes, sir.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.731
It was a tough assignment, Will.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.401
Yes. It was, sir.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.399
It's good to be back.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.899
Will, I have another assignment for you.

24:57.496 --> 25:01.115
That platoon from the coloreds
is cut off behind enemy lines.

25:02.126 --> 25:06.211
Division wants a search party to head out,
find them, and bring them back.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.415
Uh, I don't know, sir.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.217
Some of my men don't get
along well with the coloreds.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.593
Well, that's straight from the top.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.261
Yes, sir.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.107
Give me that other map.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.637
They want us to do what?

25:33.699 --> 25:37.113
You and I'll take a patrol
over to section 32.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.285
A patrol? Like four or five men?

25:39.371 --> 25:41.237
Yeah, there's a platoon from the 365th

25:41.331 --> 25:43.823
that needs a little help
getting back to friendly lines.

25:43.917 --> 25:47.126
- Those colored boys again?
- Yeah.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.169
This isn't going to be easy, sir.

25:49.256 --> 25:53.170
- The Germans are still out there.
- So it seems, Thomas.

25:53.260 --> 25:56.549
They do know that the war
is almost over, right?

25:56.638 --> 25:59.176
Yeah. Last time I checked.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.550
Sir.

26:03.479 --> 26:06.688
You know how most of the men feel
about the colored troops.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.066
It's Captain Roberts' men.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.362
And Captain Roberts is dead.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.574
All right. Who are we taking?

26:24.041 --> 26:28.706
Kirby, Pinchelli, O'Malley,
Quinn and Cardinni, okay?

26:28.796 --> 26:31.129
- The regulars, then?
- I guess so.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.332
Have them squared away
and ready to go in 30.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.586
Where are you going?

26:35.594 --> 26:38.803
- I'm going to find our runner.
- A runner?

26:38.889 --> 26:40.175
Yes, sir.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.155
- Can I help you, Captain?
- I'm looking for a Private Cain.

27:03.455 --> 27:07.324
Jenkins, get your lazy ass up.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.459
Go and see if you can find Cain.

27:10.546 --> 27:11.878
Yes, sir.

27:13.549 --> 27:16.166
I don't know what good he'll do you.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.297
Nigger don't know a goddamn thing.

27:18.387 --> 27:21.846
I beg your pardon, Captain.

27:21.932 --> 27:24.766
Are you looking for that Roberts platoon?

27:24.852 --> 27:27.310
No shit.

27:27.396 --> 27:30.480
I think they should just let them French
bastards figure those niggers out.

27:32.901 --> 27:36.611
I, uh, I wouldn't know,
Captain.

27:36.697 --> 27:39.314
You never had a nigger
under your command?

27:40.325 --> 27:41.907
No.

27:42.911 --> 27:45.153
Troublesome bunch, them niggers.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.116
They ain't as smart as you and me.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.001
Again, I wouldn't know.

27:52.087 --> 27:57.378
Uncle Sam dresses 'em up,
gives them a uniform, calls them soldiers.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.297
It's all just a damn show.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.468
Let me give you some advice, Captain.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.100
Don't find them niggers.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.513
They deserve what's coming to 'em.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.229
You don't want this.

28:16.236 --> 28:21.277
You get stuck commanding these dumb apes.
That's my burden.

28:32.502 --> 28:35.040
Well, are you just going
to stand there, boy, or what?

28:37.883 --> 28:40.967
Private John A. Cain,
reporting as ordered, sir.

28:41.053 --> 28:44.387
See? A nigger can have some manners.

28:46.183 --> 28:47.264
Right?

28:51.688 --> 28:57.025
You have been reassigned

28:57.110 --> 28:59.318
to this Captain.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.989
Understand?

29:06.203 --> 29:08.240
I understand, sir.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.616
You talking back to me, boy?

29:10.707 --> 29:12.539
Private, uh, gear and rifle?

29:12.626 --> 29:16.165
- No, sir.
- We'll get you some.

29:16.255 --> 29:19.043
Captain, thank you.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.543
I'll take it from here.

29:25.514 --> 29:26.514
Rivers...

29:27.641 --> 29:29.303
remember what I said.

29:30.394 --> 29:32.681
You don't want to end up like me.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.481
Captain.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.836
Just grab a rifle and any gear
you need right here.

30:02.926 --> 30:03.962
Thank you.

30:05.554 --> 30:09.594
Now when you, uh, left your platoon
who was, uh, commanding officer?

30:09.683 --> 30:13.552
Sergeant Perry, sir.
I'm not sure about him now.

30:14.563 --> 30:17.021
I guess he still is. Old man won't die.

30:17.107 --> 30:19.190
Just grab as much ammo as you can.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.820
Thank you, sir.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.525
For what?

30:27.701 --> 30:29.408
For sticking up for me back there.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.738
Let's get something straight.

30:33.832 --> 30:37.041
We're not friends.
I have orders to help find your platoon.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.335
That's all there is between us,
do you understand that?

30:42.507 --> 30:43.507
Yes, sir.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.058
Why is he out front?

31:41.149 --> 31:42.149
What's the matter?

31:43.151 --> 31:44.187
I don't like it.

31:44.277 --> 31:46.394
Ol' Rivers must trust him
or he wouldn't be here.

31:46.488 --> 31:49.151
Yeah. No one asked
for your advice, bumpkin.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.279
Rescue some dumb louts that got
lost behind enemy lines.

31:52.369 --> 31:53.701
Great way to end the war.

31:53.787 --> 31:55.667
Yeah. If you ask me,
this whole mission is nuts.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.490
Yeah. I didn't join the army
to go on some spook rescue mission.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.290
You shouldn't call them that.

32:00.377 --> 32:03.245
Why? That is what they are.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.250
Oh, you think they like
being called that?

32:05.340 --> 32:07.502
No, sir. No.
They're just like you and me.

32:11.721 --> 32:14.589
- They ain't like me.
- Nobody's like you.

32:14.683 --> 32:16.723
Yeah, coming from the hayseed,
that don't mean much.

32:16.810 --> 32:19.223
- Yeah. Where are you from again?
- Missoula.

32:19.312 --> 32:20.803
What did you call me?

32:20.897 --> 32:23.105
Missoula, Montana.

32:26.403 --> 32:28.144
The hell you guys do
in Missoula, Montana?

32:29.281 --> 32:31.773
I don't know. This, mostly.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.859
Sounds great 'cause I ain't
never going to visit.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.952
It's actually a pretty
nice place, you know, the...

32:36.037 --> 32:39.280
- Oh, shut it, will you?
- I think you guys would really like it.

32:39.374 --> 32:42.833
No. No one cares 'cause there ain't
nothing like 41st Street back home.

32:42.919 --> 32:43.919
That's right.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.401
You're awfully quiet over there, Mick.

32:48.425 --> 32:51.964
Well, I'm carrying this heavy bastard
and I'm tired of your shit.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.531
Yeah. Well,
you ain't much better than me.

32:53.555 --> 32:57.674
The lot of youse, a bunch of smoked Irish
if you ask me.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.972
- I could go for a smoke.
- Yeah. And a pint.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.724
- Yeah. Me too.
- Me too.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.770
Have you guys noticed anything weird
about the Captain?

33:11.865 --> 33:13.447
What?

33:13.533 --> 33:14.819
I don't know, he just seems off.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.276
Man, the Captain's just fine.

33:16.369 --> 33:18.890
Yeah. Pinchelli is probably getting
your guard down to steal all your stuff.

33:18.914 --> 33:19.950
Cool it, Card.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.997
- No one is touching me.
- Cut it out, will ya?

33:24.419 --> 33:27.537
Sergeant, do you want me
to shut the men up, sir?

33:27.631 --> 33:29.167
No, no. They're okay.

33:30.592 --> 33:32.504
How is everything going up here, Captain?

33:32.594 --> 33:33.835
Fine as can be.

33:35.263 --> 33:37.050
How is he doing?

33:37.140 --> 33:39.177
Well, if he was lost,
we wouldn't know it.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.553
- He does know where he's going, though?
- No.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.481
We're heading
to their last known location.

33:49.444 --> 33:51.436
Do you think those men
are still out there?

33:53.698 --> 33:55.405
They're US soldiers.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.696
Yeah. But alive?

34:00.789 --> 34:01.950
I don't know.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.620
It's hard to say.

34:07.212 --> 34:10.330
Well, the war could be over
before we find them.

34:10.422 --> 34:13.166
Yeah, it could be.

34:13.260 --> 34:16.219
But when have we ever been that lucky?

34:17.806 --> 34:19.467
First time for everything, sir.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.683
Thomas.

34:29.484 --> 34:31.128
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.438
- What is this?
- Pain station, sir.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.442
Captain.

34:35.532 --> 34:36.568
- Captain.
- Nurse.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.219
What's going on here?

34:38.243 --> 34:40.280
The Red Cross Field Hospital.

34:40.370 --> 34:43.362
- You're a long way from home...
- Miss Clairborne.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.415
Miss Clairborne,
uh, who are all these people?

34:46.501 --> 34:48.538
We've been collecting them from all over.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.792
Gassed. We do what we can for them here
and then we send them off for treatment.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.415
Am I looking at Germans?

34:54.509 --> 34:56.545
Yes. Them too.

34:56.636 --> 34:59.674
Every man is equal
in the eyes of the Red Cross.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.130
You're not safe here, miss.

35:01.224 --> 35:05.093
- Is anyone safe anywhere in this war?
- Well, no. I'm just saying that...

35:05.186 --> 35:07.929
- You're... that I'm a woman?
- No, it's not that...

35:08.023 --> 35:11.357
Look, Captain,
I appreciate your concern,

35:11.443 --> 35:15.312
but this is what I signed up for.
This is my war.

35:15.405 --> 35:16.941
- Okay.
- Are you here to help?

35:17.032 --> 35:19.775
Uh, we would love to but, uh, we're
actually trying to make contact

35:21.244 --> 35:23.657
with a platoon
that was lost behind enemy lines.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.955
Negroes?

35:26.041 --> 35:29.330
- Yeah. Do you know where they are?
- We had a few come in this morning.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.786
Uh, hold on, uh, Private Cain?

35:33.298 --> 35:34.960
Uh, can you take us to them right away?

35:35.050 --> 35:36.586
- Yes.
- Uh, follow me.

35:44.559 --> 35:47.472
- They're right over here.
- Joseph?

35:47.562 --> 35:48.973
John?

35:50.065 --> 35:52.682
I said I'd come back, didn't I?

35:55.320 --> 35:56.902
You going to be all right?

36:00.784 --> 36:03.242
- Ma'am?
- For now, yes.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.365
What about the others?
Ask about the others.

36:05.455 --> 36:08.823
Hey, Joseph,
I brought some help.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.874
Where's the rest of the platoon?

36:13.922 --> 36:15.083
They hit us hard, John...

36:18.343 --> 36:20.050
but we held.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.050
We did hold.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.848
Where are the others?

36:27.852 --> 36:29.718
They're held up on the hill.

36:29.813 --> 36:32.806
- All dug in.
- How far?

36:35.902 --> 36:38.189
- I don't know.
- Joseph...

36:39.781 --> 36:42.023
Think. It's important.

36:44.619 --> 36:45.951
It's a large hill.

36:48.748 --> 36:54.210
We could see it for a distance,
five or six miles.

36:55.964 --> 36:58.297
That's good. Good job.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.042
- John?
- Yeah?

37:01.136 --> 37:02.502
Is it true?

37:04.639 --> 37:06.926
Is the war almost over?

37:07.016 --> 37:10.054
You bet it is.
We've almost got those Huns licked.

37:12.689 --> 37:14.396
I want to see my family.

37:14.482 --> 37:17.395
You'll see 'em.
You'll see 'em soon.

37:17.485 --> 37:20.978
Mary, more are coming in. Gas.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.563
Go.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.944
We're going to get really busy
and you two can't be here.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.275
Uh, nurse.

37:27.746 --> 37:31.740
- Thank you.
- Mary. My name is Mary.

37:31.833 --> 37:33.199
Be safe.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.443
Private.

37:38.923 --> 37:41.757
- Be safe.
- Thanks, brother.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.809
Oh, you want another?

37:54.773 --> 37:57.390
- Move the cards, gentlemen.
- Anything new?

37:57.484 --> 37:59.271
Move the friggin' cards.
Let's go.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.274
All right, listen.

38:02.363 --> 38:04.650
The Germans know that the war
is basically over.

38:04.741 --> 38:07.449
Any ground that's kept by the allies

38:07.535 --> 38:09.221
is going to be part
of the French countryside.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.781
The French would love to hear that.

38:10.872 --> 38:14.616
Joseph said they were dug in on a hill,
can see the countryside for miles.

38:14.709 --> 38:17.167
Now, take a look. We're here...

38:17.253 --> 38:21.497
and Hill 473 is on the river
just northwest of here.

38:21.591 --> 38:24.629
Now that's the tallest hill in the sector.
They could be there.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.460
Do we even know if they're still alive?

38:26.554 --> 38:28.716
Hey. If Joseph said they're there,
then they're there.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.719
- Yeah. Who's asking you?
- Shut it.

38:30.809 --> 38:34.348
Listen, dead or alive,
we're following these orders.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.099
Do you understand?

38:36.189 --> 38:38.647
All right? Are there any questions?

38:38.733 --> 38:40.850
I'm asking you a question.
Are there any questions?

38:40.944 --> 38:42.784
- No, sir.
- Okay, form up.

38:42.862 --> 38:45.104
- Sergeant, on me.
- Yes, sir.

38:45.198 --> 38:47.030
Gear up, boys.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.488
Still trying to find some lost nigs.

38:50.578 --> 38:53.015
What kind of world is this?
We should let the Germans finish them...

38:53.039 --> 38:54.996
Hey, hey, hey...

38:55.083 --> 38:56.393
- Save it! Save it.
- Calm down.

38:56.417 --> 38:57.686
What, are you on his side?

38:57.710 --> 38:59.313
- What, are you on his side?
- Hey, come on, let him go.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.397
Cardinni, cool off.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.690
What are you two crying about?

39:01.714 --> 39:03.455
Pack up. Shut your mouth.

39:56.019 --> 39:57.059
What do you think?

39:59.856 --> 40:01.063
Yeah, I don't know.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.566
It's hard to tell.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.941
- Maybe they got something to eat.
- Maybe nobody's home.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.945
Mick, I can't see a damn thing.

40:19.876 --> 40:22.914
- It looks empty to me.
- It doesn't mean it is.

40:25.340 --> 40:28.003
All right, tactical movement.
Two on, two off. Who's up?

40:32.096 --> 40:34.839
- Who's up?
- I'll go.

40:46.569 --> 40:47.855
I'll go.

40:57.372 --> 40:58.613
All right, on my mark.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.011
- That's where I'd be.
- Get that Chauchat on them.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.688
Quinn, Pinchelli, you're up.

41:28.111 --> 41:32.606
Quinn, Pinchelli, go. You're up.
Go, go, go.

41:37.954 --> 41:38.954
Go!

41:41.124 --> 41:42.865
I'm out. Reloading.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.796
That MG is tearing us up.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.958
They have my position.

41:58.141 --> 41:59.598
Get down.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.348
Go, go, go, go!
You're up! Go!

42:05.565 --> 42:07.682
- You said you'd never do that again.
- I lied.

42:10.570 --> 42:12.170
Huns!

42:18.411 --> 42:19.572
Jam!

42:34.469 --> 42:37.712
This is a tight spot, Will.
You got anymore tricks up your sleeve?

42:37.805 --> 42:39.341
Nope. That's it.

42:42.435 --> 42:43.846
All right, we're up.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.308
Go, go.

42:54.822 --> 42:57.109
- What the hell was that?
- Clear!

43:01.871 --> 43:03.658
- Clear.
- Sir?

43:06.709 --> 43:09.417
You boys okay? Hell of a firefight.

43:09.504 --> 43:11.291
Yeah, Lieutenant.

43:11.380 --> 43:13.588
What outfit you with?

43:13.674 --> 43:15.916
General Russel Simmons, sir.
Thirty-third.

43:16.010 --> 43:19.424
Captain Will Rivers, 432nd.

43:19.514 --> 43:22.257
Germans pushed right up
our center. Cut us in two.

43:22.350 --> 43:25.058
Couldn't find these guys
until you and your boys got them talking.

43:25.144 --> 43:29.434
We've been looking for them all day.
Been wreaking havoc on our patrols.

43:29.524 --> 43:31.186
You're here to tell us the war is over?

43:31.275 --> 43:33.813
No. I'm afraid not.

43:34.821 --> 43:38.030
We're trying to make contact
with a platoon from the 365th.

43:38.116 --> 43:40.654
- They have been cut off.
- The Buffalo soldiers.

43:43.079 --> 43:47.198
- You know where they are?
- You've got to come with me, sir.

43:51.546 --> 43:53.629
The Germans have been
reinforcing this area all day.

43:53.714 --> 43:55.250
Mm-hmm. They're pulling back.

43:55.341 --> 43:59.301
End of the war, you'd think everybody
would be ready to stop the fighting.

43:59.387 --> 44:01.253
Nobody wants
to give up their territory.

44:01.347 --> 44:03.464
The French press us to attack,
Germans defend.

44:03.558 --> 44:05.800
There's a lot of that happening.

44:05.893 --> 44:08.556
Now, if you're looking for the 92nd,
I can't say I envy you.

44:10.398 --> 44:11.934
Hill 473.

44:12.024 --> 44:14.983
With three German battalions
between us and them.

44:15.069 --> 44:16.731
How can you be sure
they're up there?

44:16.821 --> 44:18.882
Germans have been laying
a thick blanket of artillery,

44:18.906 --> 44:20.863
concentrating on that hill.

44:20.950 --> 44:22.612
If they are anywhere,
they are there.

44:22.702 --> 44:25.240
You think we'll able to get
through the German line?

44:25.329 --> 44:28.743
It might be possible.
Still got a lot of open field out there.

44:28.833 --> 44:31.200
Germans send out patrols
and shoot at our patrols.

44:31.294 --> 44:34.128
You got artillery positions here and here,

44:34.213 --> 44:37.877
with a little, uh, mix of machine guns
guarding the flanks.

44:37.967 --> 44:40.505
That's a lot of area to cover.

44:42.138 --> 44:43.740
The Germans
are laid in for a siege.

44:43.764 --> 44:46.723
Whoever is on that hill
is gonna get hit hard.

44:46.809 --> 44:50.348
- And you're sure this isn't your guys?
- No. My platoons are all accounted for.

44:50.438 --> 44:53.598
And you're gonna have a hell of a time
finding them if they're not on that hill.

44:55.776 --> 44:57.938
- Can I have this?
- Yeah.

45:02.033 --> 45:05.151
If it was me, sir, I'd leave
those colored boys out there.

45:06.162 --> 45:09.746
The war is almost up. There's no reason
to go risking yourself for it.

45:13.836 --> 45:17.329
- Thanks for the map.
- Anything else I can do for you?

45:17.423 --> 45:20.211
Yeah. A nice warm place
for my men to sleep?

45:20.301 --> 45:22.008
We got a warm beer cellar.

45:24.096 --> 45:26.554
- I like warm beer.
- I like warm beer.

45:26.641 --> 45:30.100
Captain, I don't know what
you're doing, but good luck.

45:30.186 --> 45:34.305
Thank you, Lieutenant. To the cellar.

45:34.398 --> 45:35.479
Let's go.

45:39.111 --> 45:41.398
Come in.

45:43.032 --> 45:44.773
Am I disturbing you, sir?

45:44.867 --> 45:46.483
Not at all. Come on in.

45:50.539 --> 45:55.330
I just thought you should know.
The Germans have signed the ceasefire.

45:55.419 --> 45:56.830
It just came over the wire.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.749
What did they finally agree to?

46:05.137 --> 46:07.049
Summed up...

46:07.139 --> 46:08.880
a cessation of hostilities,

46:08.975 --> 46:12.685
the withdrawal of German forces
to behind the Rhine.

46:12.770 --> 46:16.559
Allied occupation of the Rhineland
and bridgeheads further east,

46:16.649 --> 46:20.643
the... preservation of infrastructure.

46:20.736 --> 46:24.355
The surrender of aircraft,
warships and military material.

46:24.448 --> 46:27.907
The complete release
of allied prisoners of war,

46:27.994 --> 46:31.283
in turn, civilians
and eventual reparation.

46:31.372 --> 46:33.739
No release of German prisoners

46:33.833 --> 46:38.703
and... no relaxation of the naval
blockade of Germany.

46:41.424 --> 46:44.383
- The war is over.
- The war is over, sir.

46:46.345 --> 46:48.007
When?

46:52.310 --> 46:56.475
"Terms will come into effect
11:00 a.m. November, the 11th."

46:56.564 --> 46:59.022
November the 11th.

46:59.108 --> 47:00.315
Does the President know?

47:01.694 --> 47:03.964
We got word from his chief of staff
and came right to you.

47:03.988 --> 47:07.402
Hmm. And they agree?

47:07.491 --> 47:10.450
President Wilson
couldn't be happier.

47:10.536 --> 47:14.371
Gonna make the announcement
to Congress and then the country.

47:20.504 --> 47:21.790
Sir.

47:21.881 --> 47:25.215
- There's something else?
- Yes, sir.

47:25.301 --> 47:27.338
French high command have requested

47:27.428 --> 47:30.296
that we continue to press the Germans
'til the last minute.

47:32.892 --> 47:34.099
Yes.

47:35.853 --> 47:38.140
So the French are looking
for more territory?

47:39.398 --> 47:41.481
It would appear that way, sir.

47:41.567 --> 47:44.184
Sometimes I wonder
the price of being an ally.

47:47.448 --> 47:49.110
A lot of good boys are gonna die.

47:50.910 --> 47:52.993
A lot of good boys already have.

47:56.248 --> 47:58.661
All right. Well...

48:02.338 --> 48:05.706
Tell the commanders there will be
no let up on the orders.

48:05.800 --> 48:09.009
They're to follow
the same orders till 11:00 a.m.

48:10.638 --> 48:11.638
Sir?

48:11.722 --> 48:15.591
We will hunt those Hun bastards
until the very end.

48:15.684 --> 48:18.848
- 11:00 a.m., Colonel.
- It will be done, sir.

48:20.856 --> 48:22.472
- Hey, Jack?
- Yes, sir?

48:24.777 --> 48:26.894
Has there been any word
about those negroes?

48:26.987 --> 48:28.899
None that I know of, sir.

48:31.659 --> 48:33.696
We still don't have their location.

48:33.786 --> 48:37.780
No, sir, we... we don't.
May I ask you a question, sir?

48:40.042 --> 48:41.249
Sure.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.586
Why those negroes?

48:49.969 --> 48:52.211
You do know my nickname, don't you?

48:52.304 --> 48:54.591
Black Jack.

48:56.142 --> 48:59.726
I was the leader of the Tenth Cavalry
when it was a black unit.

49:01.272 --> 49:04.390
We ran up San Juan Hill together.

49:04.483 --> 49:08.568
Best goddamn soldiers, best fighting force
I've ever had the pleasure to command.

49:10.739 --> 49:13.573
I'll put the word down the wire, sir.

49:13.659 --> 49:14.979
Let me know if you hear anything.

49:16.620 --> 49:18.077
Yes, sir.

49:22.543 --> 49:24.409
The war is over.

49:41.020 --> 49:42.261
Sir?

49:43.606 --> 49:46.599
- Sir, are you okay?
- Hmm?

49:46.692 --> 49:48.524
- You okay?
- Yeah.

49:48.611 --> 49:50.273
I... Yeah. I'm just tired.

49:50.362 --> 49:52.604
- Yeah. I bet.
- I'm good.

49:54.992 --> 49:56.733
Oh, yeah. Please.

49:59.830 --> 50:01.492
Good. That's enough.

50:09.340 --> 50:11.252
You want me to tell the others
to get some rest?

50:11.342 --> 50:15.336
No, no. Let them...
let them do what they're doing.

50:20.226 --> 50:23.185
You know, the war could come
to an end before daylight.

50:23.270 --> 50:25.683
Yeah, maybe.

50:27.233 --> 50:28.895
Maybe.

50:28.984 --> 50:31.192
It's funny, though...

50:31.278 --> 50:33.816
that they would send us out
so close to the end.

50:35.407 --> 50:37.114
Well, maybe it's important.

50:40.037 --> 50:44.281
It's just a lot of trouble to go rescue
a bunch of lost black boys.

50:51.173 --> 50:53.415
Do you remember
when we hit the French coast?

50:53.509 --> 50:56.718
My boots got soaked
with saltwater.

50:56.804 --> 50:58.644
I'd walk around
and they would squish for days.

51:00.349 --> 51:03.683
Well, when we were marching up
to the front, that's, uh...

51:03.769 --> 51:06.227
that's the first time
I ever saw a black soldier.

51:06.313 --> 51:08.179
- French, right?
- Yeah.

51:08.274 --> 51:10.857
They were marching back
from the front.

51:10.943 --> 51:12.525
And they wore these...

51:12.611 --> 51:18.232
what I suppose was ears and fingers
around their necks,

51:18.325 --> 51:19.845
like on a string.
Do you remember that?

51:21.328 --> 51:23.035
No. I don't remember that.

51:23.122 --> 51:24.863
- No?
- No. Mm-mm.

51:24.957 --> 51:28.997
I just... I remember thinking how strange
that was, I mean, to wear that around.

51:29.086 --> 51:33.046
And then I found out later
that these blacks were...

51:33.132 --> 51:36.421
were straight
from the French-African colonies.

51:36.510 --> 51:38.126
And in their tribes,

51:38.220 --> 51:44.262
they would wear the ears and the fingers
of their... of their enemies.

51:44.351 --> 51:47.719
You know it would show,
like, the true warrior spirit.

51:47.813 --> 51:53.184
You know like... like bravery
in combat, like, uh...

51:53.277 --> 51:55.644
- like trophies, something like that.
- Hmm.

51:55.738 --> 51:58.105
- Like the Indians?
- Yeah. Just like the Indians.

52:01.994 --> 52:03.906
Now that would be a sight to see.

52:06.040 --> 52:07.372
Warriors.

52:09.168 --> 52:12.286
- Or barbarians, huh?
- We could ask some Indians.

52:12.379 --> 52:14.245
We could ask some Indians.
Find me an Indian.

52:14.340 --> 52:17.048
Can I have a refill?

52:20.888 --> 52:22.470
Good, good. Thank you.

52:27.645 --> 52:29.102
Ahem.

52:34.318 --> 52:38.858
You know, um, Roberts and I joined
the army at the same time.

52:38.947 --> 52:39.947
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

52:40.032 --> 52:42.399
We came up as officers
at the same time too.

52:42.493 --> 52:44.155
- No shit.
- Yeah.

52:44.244 --> 52:45.655
Huh.

52:46.872 --> 52:50.661
So how did he come to be in command
of them colored fellas?

52:50.751 --> 52:54.961
Well, he always said that the color
of a man's skin did not make the man.

52:57.216 --> 52:58.832
I suppose it doesn't.

52:59.885 --> 53:03.629
Yeah... A lot of good it did him,
he's dead.

53:05.766 --> 53:07.803
We move out at dawn.

53:07.893 --> 53:11.307
- Right, sir.
- Oh, if, uh...

53:11.397 --> 53:14.185
- if the war ends while I'm sleeping...
- Uh-huh.

53:16.402 --> 53:18.564
- ...let me sleep.
- Yeah.

53:21.115 --> 53:23.482
Night, sir.

53:30.249 --> 53:32.491
Hey, bumpkin, what are
you sewing on that old rag?

53:32.584 --> 53:33.791
I'm fixing it.

53:33.877 --> 53:35.960
Yeah. Aren't you supposed
to retire an old flag?

53:36.046 --> 53:38.789
Well, yeah. But she got
a lot of life left in her.

53:38.882 --> 53:40.089
Yeah, a lot of life.

53:40.175 --> 53:42.132
Drop it, Cardinni, all right?
Leave him be.

53:42.219 --> 53:44.339
Can we just play the game?
Stop bending my damn cards.

53:45.139 --> 53:46.630
I guess not.

53:54.022 --> 53:55.083
You think he wants to lose
some money?

53:55.107 --> 53:57.144
Everyone knows niggers
love to gamble.

53:57.234 --> 53:59.021
I told you to stop calling him that.

54:00.028 --> 54:01.144
Why?

54:01.238 --> 54:05.278
Every man deserves respect,
'til he don't.

54:05.367 --> 54:07.654
Some of your pa's country wisdom?

54:07.745 --> 54:10.362
Missoula.

54:11.957 --> 54:14.540
- Where do you think you're going?
- Away from you.

54:16.086 --> 54:17.293
Yeah. Have fun.

54:24.553 --> 54:27.261
You want some coffee?

54:27.347 --> 54:28.633
Thank you.

54:30.267 --> 54:32.975
So you want to come join us?

54:33.061 --> 54:35.474
No. Not really.

54:35.564 --> 54:36.645
Yeah. I don't blame you.

54:37.983 --> 54:40.145
Ahem. You know,
they really are good guys.

54:42.029 --> 54:43.941
I'm sure they are.

54:44.031 --> 54:45.317
Yeah.

54:47.075 --> 54:49.032
Is that a letter to back home?

54:53.332 --> 54:55.574
I write my mom as often as I can.

54:57.252 --> 54:59.585
Well, I'm sure she likes that.

55:00.798 --> 55:04.132
My mom, uh, she can't read.

55:05.469 --> 55:08.257
You know, the thing
is I know she can't read, but...

55:09.640 --> 55:14.556
Each letter back home
is proof I'm still alive. So, I write.

55:20.234 --> 55:21.350
So where are you from?

55:22.361 --> 55:24.944
- Brooklyn. Born and raised.
- Ah.

55:26.865 --> 55:27.865
You like it there?

55:27.950 --> 55:30.363
Too cold in the winter,
too hot in the summer

55:30.452 --> 55:32.739
Oh, wait a minute
you're describing Virginia.

55:32.830 --> 55:34.537
That's what I'm thinking.

55:37.292 --> 55:41.753
My mom, man, she'll sit on the porch
all day waiting for one of these letters.

55:43.006 --> 55:46.590
When this whole mess of a war started,

55:46.677 --> 55:49.420
I was down at the recruiter's office
the next day.

55:50.430 --> 55:53.889
My mom, she begged me not to go.

55:53.976 --> 55:57.344
Didn't want me dying
in some white man's war.

55:57.437 --> 55:58.973
So why did you go then?

56:00.065 --> 56:02.978
I figured if you white folks saw us
coloreds fighting for your freedom...

56:04.194 --> 56:06.060
you'd see it right
to give us our freedom.

56:08.156 --> 56:09.317
Hmm.

56:11.493 --> 56:12.859
Catholic?

56:13.954 --> 56:15.365
Yes, sir.

56:15.455 --> 56:18.698
- Baptist myself.
- Oh, all right.

56:21.545 --> 56:24.629
You know, back in the forest,

56:24.715 --> 56:27.799
I saw you praying over the wounded,
all professional like.

56:30.804 --> 56:34.468
Uh, back home I was studying
to be a priest.

56:36.059 --> 56:37.641
And you're okay with killing?

56:42.482 --> 56:45.520
Ahem. Back at the church
I studied at...

56:46.862 --> 56:50.071
every now and then a group of kids
would come in on a field trip.

56:50.157 --> 56:54.151
The priest would ask them what they all
wanted to be when they grew up.

56:54.244 --> 56:56.236
And they each said
something different, you know,

56:56.330 --> 56:59.823
policeman, fireman, cowboy.

57:03.545 --> 57:06.083
I believe I will pay for my sins.

57:07.341 --> 57:09.003
We all will.

57:10.844 --> 57:14.258
But I was willing
to sacrifice my soul...

57:15.807 --> 57:17.890
so that they wouldn't have to.

57:19.353 --> 57:22.721
I guess we're both fighting
for what we believe in, huh?

57:24.191 --> 57:25.932
Yeah, I guess we are.

57:28.820 --> 57:33.030
If you're praying, do mind putting
in a good word for me?

57:35.077 --> 57:37.535
- Of course.
- Thank you.

58:16.243 --> 58:17.923
What do you think happened here?

58:18.704 --> 58:20.616
It's got the Corporal spooked.

58:38.849 --> 58:40.715
Sir, why have we stopped?

58:40.809 --> 58:43.301
- We should really keep moving.
- Private?

58:45.147 --> 58:46.934
Did you see something?

58:47.024 --> 58:50.267
I don't know, sir.
Something doesn't feel right.

58:52.529 --> 58:55.647
A lot of dead bodies, no sign of a fight.

58:55.741 --> 58:57.152
Something's wrong, sir.

58:58.243 --> 59:00.326
Maybe they got something
good on them.

59:00.412 --> 59:02.404
Maybe they've got some food.

59:02.497 --> 59:05.456
Yeah, you got any requests for me?

59:05.542 --> 59:08.125
Hey, hey, you shouldn't
disrespect the dead.

59:08.211 --> 59:09.372
Why?

59:21.683 --> 59:23.595
Pinch!

59:23.685 --> 59:25.365
Son of a bitch,
what happened?

59:25.395 --> 59:27.432
I was just looking
for souvenirs. Honest.

59:27.522 --> 59:29.834
- German grenade, sir, booby trap.
- Is it bad? How bad is it?

59:29.858 --> 59:31.002
It's not bad,
it's not bad, it's not bad,

59:31.026 --> 59:32.670
it's not bad, it's not bad.

59:32.694 --> 59:34.005
You'll be fine,
you're going to be fine.

59:34.029 --> 59:36.069
- You're going to be fine.
- Put some whiskey on it.

59:36.156 --> 59:38.148
I feel cold, I feel cold.

59:38.241 --> 59:40.178
You're going
to be fine, Pinchelli. Hold on.

59:40.202 --> 59:41.387
Put some whiskey
on the wound.

59:41.411 --> 59:43.264
- I don't want to die.
- You're not going to die.

59:43.288 --> 59:45.325
God, I don't want to die here.

59:45.415 --> 59:48.158
- I don't want to die here.
- You're not going to die.

59:48.251 --> 59:50.651
- Give him some whiskey.
- I don't want to die, sir.

59:53.715 --> 59:56.253
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.

59:56.343 --> 59:58.585
Come on.
Help me put pressure on it.

59:58.678 --> 01:00:00.518
- I gotta get back...
- You're going back home.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.837
You're going back home.
You're going back to 41st Street.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:06.555
We're going back home.

01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:13.572
- Here. Give it to my brother.
- You give it to him yourself.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:17.024
You're going to give it to him yourself.
You're going to give it to him yourself.

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:18.980
No, no, no, we're going home.
We're going home.

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:21.566
God, I don't want to die here, Card.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:27.823
No, no.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.844
Eternal rest
be granted onto him, oh Lord.

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:08.071
Son of a bitch!

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:10.828
It's your fault! It's your fucking fault!

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:16.916
Come on, come on.
Get off, get off.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:18.484
- Let me get him!
- Cardinni!

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.486
- I didn't want that!
- Cardinni, please!

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.048
- I didn't want that!
- Cardinni, relax!

01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:24.879
Let me at him!

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:30.427
Get off of me.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.763
Hey, hey!

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:37.146
Listen, you're out of line!

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:39.852
You need to get your head on straight.

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:44.107
I get it. Do you get me?

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:47.277
Do you get me?

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.912
Great idea, sir.

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.743
We lost two of our guys doing it.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.708
Sir!

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:04.969
Why are we out here?

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:08.339
We're getting killed
for a bunch of niggers!

01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:14.021
Guys, uh...

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:17.932
A couple of things.

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.065
I, uh...

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:28.201
I suffer from, um...
from shell shock.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.323
And I don't understand it.
I don't know what it is.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:36.875
I, uh... I'm not a coward.
I don't... I don't think I am.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:42.169
But when we took that German line...

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:45.759
and your buddies were getting cut up...

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:50.218
instead of being a leader, I, uh...

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:53.468
I disintegrated. I, uh...

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:58.314
I wanted to run,
I wanted to leave the war.

01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:04.529
I jumped up into the line
of fire and, uh,

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:09.075
a black fella stopped me
and pulled me back into safety.

01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:12.028
And, uh...

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.414
here I am.

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:20.662
Now these, uh... these men
that we're looking for...

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:25.709
black or white, it doesn't matter!

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.089
Now when you go home, sure.

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:29.865
You can do what you want,
think what you want.

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:31.676
You can treat black people
any way you like.

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:32.766
When you meet your Maker,

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:36.219
He'll make decisions about the choices
that you've conjured.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:39.226
But here, today...

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:41.349
Now?

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:45.478
Those men are soldiers
in the United States Army,

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:47.404
I don't care what the color
of their skin is.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.982
We have orders to assist
in their evacuation.

01:03:57.459 --> 01:04:01.373
If you want to leave, leave.
Now's your chance.

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.336
I understand.

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:15.390
I'm staying.

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:18.226
I'm staying.

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:24.271
Bury your buddies before you go.

01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:31.444
Sergeant.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:07.669
Sir?

01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:09.917
Here's your warfare right there.

01:06:10.008 --> 01:06:13.672
I would say it is, sir.

01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:15.844
Too late for this one.

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:17.283
Something I can do for you,
Colonel?

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.799
We received word from the 77th, sir,
about the lost unit.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:25.434
They may still be alive, sir.
Holed up on Hill 174.

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:30.275
- Alive?
- The Germans seem to think so.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:36.569
- Let's go get them. Bring them home.
- Yes, sir.

01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:19.574
- Who the heck is doing the shooting?
- Hell if I know. Watch the trees.

01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:20.721
We're coming out.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:29.790
- Johnson?
- I'll be damned! Cain!

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:32.496
Man, am I glad to see you.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:33.797
Sorry, sir.

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:37.502
Uh, Corporal Johnson,
recon element of 365th.

01:07:37.595 --> 01:07:39.552
We were expecting a patrol.

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:41.221
Didn't know they'd be on horses.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:45.551
William Rivers, Captain, I company.
Uh, you with the Buffalo soldiers?

01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:47.307
Yes, sir.

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:49.935
- Well, let's go find them.
- Yes, sir. This way.

01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:03.990
Looks like you guys
got hit pretty hard.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.494
Yes, sir. They came
and they, uh, they hit us hard.

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:10.668
- How long you fellas been up here?
- Only a couple days, sir.

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.961
Hell, it's hard to keep track of
sometimes.

01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:16.506
- No reinforcements?
- You are the first soldiers we've seen.

01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:20.214
Who and where
is your commanding officer?

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:22.261
Oh, Sergeant Perry, he...
he's in there.

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:25.636
All right. Uh, Sergeant,
position the men and wait here.

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:27.559
- Yes, sir.
- Where do you want me, sir?

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:29.456
- Come with me.
- All right, boys.

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:32.689
Let's find some spots here
and up the road.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:34.310
Split up.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:41.611
Son of a bitch.

01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:48.115
- Oh, man, we didn't know if you made it.
- Ah, you know me, Sarge.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:50.163
- Captain?
- William Rivers.

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:53.502
You brought our man back.
Thank you.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:56.171
- Are you here to reinforce us?
- No, Sergeant.

01:08:57.884 --> 01:08:59.591
Well, how many men did you bring?

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:03.129
There's five of us left.

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:05.805
Well, that's not much of a relief for us.

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:10.928
Well, I have orders to bring you
and your boys back to friendly lines.

01:09:11.022 --> 01:09:14.765
Those orders come directly
from the command staff in Washington D.C.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:19.354
The war is almost finished, Sergeant.
It's time to evacuate this hill.

01:09:19.447 --> 01:09:21.359
Yeah, we've heard.

01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:24.733
The Germans been dropping those on us.

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:31.657
And so why do you stay?

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:37.292
Well, with all due respect, sir,
we will not be surrendering to the enemy.

01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:41.716
Well, with all due respect, Sergeant,
I lost two good men getting here.

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:46.764
Private, would you step outside?
I'd like to speak with Rivers.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.808
Yes, Sergeant.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:09:59.519
I am sorry you lost your men.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:03.150
Do you have any news
on Captain Roberts?

01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:05.528
Captain Roberts is dead.

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:11.913
He was your friend?

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.918
He was a good man.

01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:27.801
Do you know how many men
I've lost taking this hill?

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:30.594
No, Sergeant.

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:33.427
Twenty-seven.

01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:37.014
- Brave men. All of them.
- I'm sure they were.

01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:42.277
We landed in France this summer,

01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:45.106
trained to fight, expecting to fight.

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:49.363
They gave us shovels instead of guns.

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:53.656
We dug ditches, carried ammo...

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:56.203
hauled supplies.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:01.839
Captain Roberts begged and pleaded
for a real assignment,

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.961
a chance to get in the fight.

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:06.411
They told us that we were unfit to fight,
not ready for war.

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.677
It must have been difficult
to listen to them.

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:16.474
One day a real assignment came,
a real fight.

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:20.975
We will hold this hill

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:24.061
until reinforcements arrive,
or this war ends.

01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:30.113
You see, Captain,
these are our friendly lines,

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:32.911
and we will not be abandoning them.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.868
Are, uh, you aware...

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:41.836
that after the war,

01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:47.840
any land that's held by allies
will, uh, be lost to the Germans?

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:51.172
No.

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:54.303
This hill that you've captured, Sergeant,

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:57.431
is deep behind enemy lines. Several miles.

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:01.602
They are going to want it back.
Hell, they are going to need it back.

01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:03.228
They're going to fight like dogs.

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:10.149
Doesn't change anything.

01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:14.786
We will hold this hill.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.165
I understand why you're here, sir.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:21.960
We're choosing this fight.

01:12:22.964 --> 01:12:24.546
You don't have to.

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:29.126
Well, what if I ordered you to?

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:33.138
This is not your fight, Captain Rivers.

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:38.101
You and your men still have plenty of time
to get back to friendly lines

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:41.646
and your... white friends.

01:12:43.985 --> 01:12:46.022
You let me know what you decide.

01:13:09.176 --> 01:13:10.176
Sir?

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:17.758
What did he say?

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:23.138
This is your company, John.
You don't have to follow me anymore.

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:27.898
Sir, if it's all the same to you...

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:30.858
I think I'll finish this ride with you.

01:13:40.207 --> 01:13:42.745
So when do we leave?

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:46.703
We don't.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.003
Our orders are to bring
these men home.

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:57.680
- Stay and defend this hill.
- That's right.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:14:00.305
And then we'll bring them home.

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:04.972
Sir, may I have a moment, please?

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:18.202
Germans are going to surround
this place any moment.

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:21.655
- How do we hold...
- We're going to stay and fight.

01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:26.164
- Will...
- We are going to stay and fight.

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:28.787
Sir?

01:14:31.676 --> 01:14:33.338
Can I say something?

01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:46.101
Back home, the color of our skin
divides us.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:49.484
But out here?

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:52.770
We're all one.

01:14:56.701 --> 01:14:59.614
You are all my brothers.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:04.831
And I will never forget
the bond we share...

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:06.874
or the blood we spilled.

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:12.422
Thank you.

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:25.803
Hell, I couldn't make it back
alone anyway. Probably get lost.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:33.314
We've been scrounging
what we can.

01:15:33.404 --> 01:15:38.115
Couple of B.A.R.s, rifles, grenades,
enough ammunition to last.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.442
Couple of French Cha-Chas,
but they don't work a damn.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:43.745
Uh, and these captured
German machine guns.

01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:53.876
All right. All right, look.

01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:57.710
We... we are here, all right?

01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:00.511
The Germans are going to want to hit us
at our weakest point.

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:03.136
- Where is that?
- Oh, there. The south side.

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:04.966
It also bumps up along those trees

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:06.955
and it'll be hard to see
if the enemy is approaching.

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:09.642
Okay. Now, if we position
our machine guns at the top of the apex,

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:12.600
Germans are going to want
to take those out for sure, so we don't.

01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:18.151
We put our machine guns on the north side,
just below the crest.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.277
That will only work
if the Germans take the hill.

01:16:20.367 --> 01:16:22.654
Right, that's why we bait the Germans.

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:25.988
We put men at the base
of the south side down here.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:28.642
When the Germans attack,
we feint a retreat up and over the hill.

01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:30.579
The Germans will follow.

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:33.127
- A trap.
- Yeah, that's correct.

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:35.581
It could work...

01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:38.542
but what if they follow,
then we've lost our position?

01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:40.423
No, no. This.

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:42.846
This little round top,
we hold it at all costs.

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:45.299
Our Custer's last stand.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:49.178
I hope you boys know how to dig.

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:51.354
- Let's get to work.
- Yes, sir.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.250
Sir.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.794
Thank you.

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:49.117
Soldier, thanks.

01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:05.003
You know how to work
that thing, Cardinni?

01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:07.339
- Yeah.
- You sure?

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:13.395
- Yeah.
- Simple enough.

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:19.768
- Sir.
- Yeah?

01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:23.026
- The men are dug in as best they can be.
- Good.

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:26.699
Machine guns, grenades,
mortar rounds,

01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:29.323
- and enough ammunition to last.
- What about our flanks?

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:31.905
- Men on both sides.
- Okay.

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:35.541
I guess all we can do now is wait.

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:38.963
No.

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:49.057
Thank you.

01:18:58.317 --> 01:19:00.684
- Guess I'll go check on the men.
- Yeah, okay.

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:13.576
- Private...
- Uh...

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.958
I want you to have this, sir.

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:16.811
Sir?

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.230
Sir?

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.487
The war's almost over, huh, sir?

01:20:32.953 --> 01:20:34.160
Yeah, it is.

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:36.764
Do you think we can hold out until then?

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:39.199
Well, we'll see in the morning.

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:50.760
Amazing, isn't it?

01:20:52.556 --> 01:20:54.468
What's that?

01:20:54.558 --> 01:20:58.643
Same sky as back home,
just worlds apart.

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:23.876
- Private?
- Sir.

01:21:23.962 --> 01:21:27.581
How does it feel to slap
a superior officer in the face?

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:32.760
- What are you talking about, sir?
- I know it was you.

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:35.008
I know you saved me.

01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:37.933
- I didn't save anyone.
- No, why did you do it?

01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:39.350
You didn't owe me anything.

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:45.895
Everyone gets scared, sir.

01:21:47.152 --> 01:21:50.736
Sometimes all you need is just a little
encouragement to get through it.

01:21:56.036 --> 01:21:58.494
- Sir?
- Sergeant.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.867
German officer came in
under a white flag.

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:03.161
What does he want?

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:06.210
He wants to talk to you, sir.

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:19.015
I have told you, Corporal.

01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:25.350
Captain, your men are a bit jumpy.

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:29.021
- Corporal?
- He's clean, sir.

01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:32.316
May I put my hands down?

01:22:33.323 --> 01:22:34.439
By all means.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.617
Would any of you gentlemen
have a smoke?

01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:22.112
You cannot beat
Southern American tobacco.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:26.325
You came under a white flag, Captain.
What do you want?

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:32.038
Always to the point, Americans.

01:23:33.383 --> 01:23:34.624
I am here for your surrender.

01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:38.465
Explain.

01:23:38.555 --> 01:23:41.468
By now you have heard the war
is over tomorrow.

01:23:41.558 --> 01:23:43.675
Eleven in the morning.

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:45.010
Correct.

01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:48.851
Clearly, you can see
your position here is pointless,

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:51.024
and there is no need for more bloodshed.

01:23:51.109 --> 01:23:54.102
I, uh...

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:56.984
I think we're gonna stay.

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:03.202
These colored boys here
have fought bravely.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:04.529
I admire it.

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:08.324
But it is foolishness to continue.

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:13.205
I have two regiments
of troops and artillery

01:24:13.298 --> 01:24:15.585
moving on this hill as we speak.

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:18.175
You are surrounded.

01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:20.800
There's no hope
to survive when we attack.

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:26.093
Clearly you don't want
all your men to die.

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:28.970
Do you, Captain?

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:35.484
Corporal, Private,

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:39.565
would you please escort this Captain
back to our lines safely?

01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:41.274
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:24:42.953 --> 01:24:45.536
I will give you until dawn
to change your mind.

01:24:51.628 --> 01:24:53.620
But then I start the guns.

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:13.018
- Sir?
- Hmm? Yeah.

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:14.644
Still no sign of the enemy.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.279
Well, I trust the German
to keep his word.

01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:22.440
Artillery is going
to be tough tomorrow, sir.

01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:25.493
Yeah. Well,
I have an idea about that.

01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:36.037
- How many?
- Looks like three.

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:38.214
- Seventy-sixes?
- Yeah.

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.502
It's going to be hard
to get those guns, sir.

01:25:42.596 --> 01:25:45.384
Well, we just need to buy time,
we don't need the guns.

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:47.887
We've got to get at
and destroy that ammo.

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:50.059
Bite the head off the snake.

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:52.353
No ammo, no steel rain.

01:25:53.357 --> 01:25:56.725
Then they'll have to attack
our positions, force us out.

01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:03.152
Sir, I'd like to lead the men in.
Give them Huns some hell.

01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:06.780
- You sure about that, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:09.912
All right, listen to me.

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:13.241
You get in there and you hit them,
and you get out as fast as you can.

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:16.794
This is your hill, Sergeant.
I want you back here.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.166
Yes, sir.

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:34.103
All right, men, this is it.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:37.148
Light and fast,
leave what you don't need.

01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:40.102
Conserve your weapons
and your ammo.

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:42.687
If it ain't black, kill it.

01:28:36.603 --> 01:28:39.220
You gotta get the fuck out of here.
I'm gonna blow this thing.

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:40.896
Come on.

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:06.335
Let's go! Let's go!

01:29:11.221 --> 01:29:13.383
Get ready. You know what to do.

01:29:19.646 --> 01:29:21.808
Here they come.

01:30:10.488 --> 01:30:11.979
- I'm out.
- Me too.

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:15.066
Reload.

01:30:21.791 --> 01:30:22.872
There.

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:26.332
- They're trying to flank us.
- Not much we can do about it.

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:27.753
You can't let them get behind us.

01:30:27.839 --> 01:30:29.455
You guys go, I'll hold them back.

01:30:29.549 --> 01:30:31.506
Come on.

01:30:31.593 --> 01:30:33.880
You sure?

01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:36.178
Just go, just go.

01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:59.319
You guys keep them entertained,

01:30:59.412 --> 01:31:01.699
I'll make a break on them. Okay?

01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:05.575
One...

01:31:07.045 --> 01:31:08.161
two...

01:31:09.547 --> 01:31:10.788
three!

01:31:19.516 --> 01:31:20.802
Sniper, sniper!

01:31:37.826 --> 01:31:40.534
- I'm hit.
- Shit! What do we do?

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:42.031
Stay there, stay there.

01:31:46.042 --> 01:31:49.251
- I don't see him.
- Shit.

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:51.855
Sir, I think
we should fall back.

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:56.773
You're right, fall back.
Fall back! Fall back!

01:33:08.792 --> 01:33:10.909
Thomas?

01:33:14.172 --> 01:33:15.413
Thomas, what happened?

01:33:16.674 --> 01:33:18.711
Where were you going?

01:33:18.802 --> 01:33:20.696
We're gonna fall back.
We're gonna do this together.

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:23.337
You and me,
we're doing this together.

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:26.219
It's been a pleasure.

01:33:28.144 --> 01:33:29.635
Sir.

01:33:31.773 --> 01:33:34.140
Sir, we've got to go.

01:33:34.234 --> 01:33:36.772
No.

01:33:45.954 --> 01:33:47.320
You hold on to that, all right?

01:33:51.376 --> 01:33:54.244
Take care of yourself.
Fall back, fall back!

01:34:04.597 --> 01:34:08.216
I'm finished.

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:12.474
You two, go, leave me.
I'll get him.

01:34:12.564 --> 01:34:14.396
We won't leave you.

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:18.817
Go now, go now.
Before it's too late.

01:34:29.873 --> 01:34:32.411
All right, on three.

01:34:35.461 --> 01:34:36.668
One...

01:34:37.672 --> 01:34:38.672
two...

01:34:39.674 --> 01:34:40.674
three.

01:35:00.486 --> 01:35:01.977
I got you.

01:35:55.291 --> 01:35:57.032
Quinn, come on.

01:35:57.126 --> 01:36:00.244
Quinn, no.
Quinn, come on, keep on going.

01:36:00.338 --> 01:36:01.795
Quinn, we have to keep going. Quinn!

01:36:01.881 --> 01:36:04.419
Let's go. Come on.

01:36:58.688 --> 01:36:59.895
General.

01:36:59.981 --> 01:37:02.644
Sir, all the commanders
are pressing forward

01:37:02.734 --> 01:37:05.442
attacking the Germans
all along their lines.

01:37:05.528 --> 01:37:08.817
- Resistance?
- Germans are putting up a fight.

01:37:10.283 --> 01:37:12.525
They refuse to believe they're beaten.

01:37:14.871 --> 01:37:16.783
Bring the boys home.

01:37:20.251 --> 01:37:21.617
Sir.

01:37:24.547 --> 01:37:28.587
You tell those commanders to keep pressing
forward... till 11:00 a.m.

01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:31.464
- Sir.
- Jack.

01:37:32.889 --> 01:37:34.755
Yes, sir?

01:37:34.849 --> 01:37:38.013
- What do you think?
- About what, sir?

01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:41.637
The Germans, can we beat 'em?

01:37:43.107 --> 01:37:47.067
I believe it is not the last time
we will see the Germans in field, sir.

01:37:50.281 --> 01:37:51.522
Yeah.

01:37:53.493 --> 01:37:55.701
This'll have to be done all over again.

01:37:58.081 --> 01:38:00.073
I'll send the message
down the line.

01:38:20.269 --> 01:38:21.269
Captain?

01:38:22.855 --> 01:38:24.312
I'm okay, Private.

01:38:33.908 --> 01:38:36.446
Sir, do you mind?

01:38:40.415 --> 01:38:42.327
Now they'll know who holds this hill.

01:38:44.794 --> 01:38:47.002
Half the men are gone, sir.

01:38:47.088 --> 01:38:49.421
Most of the rest are wounded.

01:38:51.342 --> 01:38:52.924
What about ammunition?

01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:55.844
Not much, some men are only down
to a few rounds left.

01:38:58.099 --> 01:38:59.556
Here they come.

01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:05.229
All right, we can't retreat.

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:09.312
And God, if we stay here...

01:39:11.529 --> 01:39:14.522
Affix bayonets. We affix bayonets.

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:16.447
You take the left flank,
you go center,

01:39:16.534 --> 01:39:19.572
I take the right flank
and we sweep down the hill.

01:39:19.662 --> 01:39:21.654
- You mean charge.
- Yeah, we charge on them

01:39:21.747 --> 01:39:23.739
while the Germans
are coming up the hill.

01:39:23.833 --> 01:39:26.291
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir. Yeah.

01:39:26.377 --> 01:39:28.039
Okay, move out.
Fix bayonets, let's go.

01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:30.337
- Fix bayonets!
- Fix bayonets!

01:40:04.123 --> 01:40:06.581
Private Cain.

01:42:43.908 --> 01:42:46.241
- You are hit!
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:42:46.327 --> 01:42:48.865
- Medic! Medic!
- Shh! Shh!

01:42:54.043 --> 01:42:58.287
11:03. The war is over.

01:42:59.298 --> 01:43:01.836
- I never had a chance to thank you.
- You don't have to.

01:43:05.471 --> 01:43:07.383
Listen...

01:43:07.473 --> 01:43:12.434
Listen... war does not determine
who's right.

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.853
Only who's left.

01:43:17.066 --> 01:43:20.184
But what we did here,
what we did here...

01:43:22.321 --> 01:43:26.736
This is right.
This is our greatest victory.

01:43:47.346 --> 01:43:50.214
Read it. Read it, please.

01:43:51.892 --> 01:43:53.383
"My dearest William,

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:58.813
since we were children, I knew
you'd always be there for me.

01:44:00.234 --> 01:44:02.851
You have been in my life
since its beginning,

01:44:02.945 --> 01:44:04.982
and you're still here even at its end.

01:44:06.449 --> 01:44:10.318
I know you're optimistic, but I fear
I will not survive this illness.

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:16.782
If that is the case, I will go peacefully

01:44:16.876 --> 01:44:20.085
having experienced a life
well lived by your side.

01:44:21.714 --> 01:44:25.298
The coming months will be hard
but I want you to be strong.

01:44:26.427 --> 01:44:29.465
Live life to the fullest,
and never give up.

01:44:30.723 --> 01:44:33.761
Go to all the places
we talked about visiting,

01:44:33.851 --> 01:44:36.264
<i>I will be with you
every step of the way.</i>

01:44:37.438 --> 01:44:41.148
<i>As long as you live, my spirit
will live on with you.</i>

01:44:42.234 --> 01:44:45.693
Eternally yours, Harriet."
