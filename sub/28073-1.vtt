01:00.100 --> 01:02.105
Like the song says,

01:02.352 --> 01:05.364
Santa knows who's been naughty
and who's been nice.

01:05.939 --> 01:09.569
Make it on the Nice List, and you can
expect a visit from Prep and Landing.

01:11.652 --> 01:13.289
But end up on the Naughty List,

01:13.821 --> 01:16.454
well, then get ready
for a whole different crew.

01:17.491 --> 01:18.783
The Coal Elf Brigade.

01:39.677 --> 01:42.689
Their job, confirm and deliver.

01:45.640 --> 01:50.563
Their goal, to rehabilitate children
one lump of coal at a time.

01:51.855 --> 01:53.065
These guys are tough.

01:54.189 --> 01:57.322
Always prepared
for those naughty kids.

01:57.901 --> 01:59.953
Well, almost always.

02:16.293 --> 02:17.336
Look out!

02:25.510 --> 02:26.850
Good dog.

02:31.056 --> 02:32.183
All right. Yes. Good.

02:32.849 --> 02:34.735
No, no, no! Just get it done!

02:34.934 --> 02:36.939
If those turtle doves aren't cleared
off the runway, believe me,

02:37.020 --> 02:38.443
Dancer will swallow one on take-off.

02:39.271 --> 02:42.036
Ice blocks!
Book 30 minutes at Spa Navidad.

02:42.107 --> 02:44.527
If Renato is available, make it an hour.

02:44.610 --> 02:46.579
Okay, Mr. Thistleton, come on.
T-minus three days.

02:46.653 --> 02:47.826
Give me some good news, baby.

02:47.904 --> 02:52.578
Happy to oblige, baby. I mean, Magee!
Of course. Why did I say that?

02:52.742 --> 02:54.663
Naughty and Nice List servers
are online,

02:54.744 --> 02:56.297
protective firewalls are in place,

02:56.370 --> 03:00.213
and we are processing behavioural data
from around the world as we speak.

03:00.666 --> 03:04.047
It appears we may have a record
number of nice children this year.

03:24.812 --> 03:27.777
Someone is being very naughty.

03:28.899 --> 03:31.319
I've been really nice this year.

03:32.402 --> 03:33.494
What the heck? I'll take it!

03:33.987 --> 03:38.578
- Well, that is holly jolly, sir.
-Hey, Wayne! Done shopping!

03:39.951 --> 03:41.422
Got any of those beaded seat covers?

03:41.493 --> 03:45.170
I'm heading home to trim the tree
with my family. You wanna come?

03:45.872 --> 03:49.715
Thanks, Lanny, but this new Natale
is all the family I need.

03:50.001 --> 03:51.554
It's a Turbo!

03:51.627 --> 03:53.050
Hey, you think you can
take out the passenger seat?

03:53.963 --> 03:55.683
I got it.

03:55.757 --> 03:58.140
Wayne! Code Red!

03:58.675 --> 04:00.597
Cranberry Red!

04:00.802 --> 04:03.270
Gene, I'll be right back! Do not sell it!

04:03.846 --> 04:06.979
Sorry to drag you boys away
from your little shopping spree,

04:07.058 --> 04:09.027
but we have a situation. Mr. Thistleton?

04:09.393 --> 04:12.157
Yes, we have recently discovered
that last year,

04:12.228 --> 04:15.941
a Fruitcake Conduct Calculator
fell into the hands of a naughty child

04:16.024 --> 04:20.827
with the nefarious screen name,
Jinglesmell1337.

04:21.488 --> 04:22.531
Great garland!

04:22.780 --> 04:25.628
Using our stolen technology,
the juvenile is attempting

04:25.700 --> 04:29.211
to ascertain the password to the
Naughty and Nice List database.

04:30.119 --> 04:32.042
And that we cannot allow.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.176
On a personal note, I'd like to add

04:34.249 --> 04:36.170
that my superior intellect
and! take umbrage...

04:36.250 --> 04:37.377
Got it. Thanks, Smart Guy.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.763
Tiny, we almost there?

04:41.547 --> 04:44.264
- So that's why the Big Guy wants...
-Yeah, okay, okay.

04:44.341 --> 04:46.013
I know what you're gonna ask.

04:46.385 --> 04:48.223
Will The Prep and Landing guy

04:48.303 --> 04:52.644
step forth in the face of crisis
and retrieve that Fruitcake?

04:52.723 --> 04:56.733
Yes. Yes, he will. He'd be honoured.

04:57.310 --> 04:59.481
Waynie, Wayne, you are adorable.

04:59.855 --> 05:01.575
But how to put this?

05:01.647 --> 05:04.068
The Big Guy thinks
you need a little more help.

05:04.359 --> 05:05.700
A Naughty Kid Field Expert.

05:06.402 --> 05:08.288
Wait, what? You mean a Coal Elf?

05:08.571 --> 05:11.952
He'll meet you at Christmas Carol's.
I'm sure everything will be fine.

05:12.032 --> 05:13.953
Don't hate me.
Floor it, Tiny. Okay, bye!

05:14.326 --> 05:16.295
A Coal Elf? Tinsel!

05:17.370 --> 05:18.414
We don't need any help.

05:20.206 --> 05:23.718
Naughty, naughty children
Better start acting nice

05:25.628 --> 05:27.679
Naughty, naughty children
Better start...

05:27.754 --> 05:29.142
Fifteen minutes late.

05:29.214 --> 05:32.892
This Naughty Kid Field Expert,
no expert on time.

05:36.262 --> 05:37.354
Thank you, sir!

05:40.641 --> 05:42.231
But, ma'am... Ma'am!

05:42.559 --> 05:44.232
I mean, lady?

05:47.730 --> 05:50.530
Hey, you know,
that's gonna be me. Yeah.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.535
- What's that?
-The Elf of the Year.

05:52.610 --> 05:56.785
Hey, aren't you that
Preps and Landing guy? Dwayne, is it?

05:56.863 --> 05:59.829
It's Wayne. And, indeed, I am.

05:59.908 --> 06:03.751
Hey, everybody!
It's Dwayne from Preps and Landing!

06:03.829 --> 06:04.920
Hey, I heard of you!

06:04.996 --> 06:06.669
He's gonna be Elf of the Year!

06:06.747 --> 06:09.879
Yeah, I guess I'm here
to save Christmas or something.

06:09.959 --> 06:13.304
I'm the Prep and Landing guy, so...
Well, what are you gonna do, huh?

06:13.378 --> 06:18.812
Yeah, I'll be leading this expedition
once our so-called expert arrives.

06:18.883 --> 06:20.436
- He's here!
-It's him! He's here.

06:23.012 --> 06:24.400
Jingle-bam!

06:28.142 --> 06:29.647
That's got to be the expert!

06:32.312 --> 06:33.700
How's everybody doing?

06:34.355 --> 06:35.398
Noel?

06:37.358 --> 06:40.122
Sorry about the mess, there, Carol.

06:40.194 --> 06:44.665
I got all excited. I just dropped
some serious coin on my new Natale.

06:44.739 --> 06:45.831
It's a Turbo!

06:46.157 --> 06:49.170
Hey, Wayne, that looks just like
the snowmobile you were gonna buy.

06:49.536 --> 06:52.121
- Noel?
-Gene said he had another buyer,

06:52.205 --> 06:54.589
but I turned on the old Noel charm.

06:54.790 --> 06:55.917
Noel?

06:56.124 --> 07:00.004
And now I'm here to save Christmas.
Jingle-bam!

07:00.337 --> 07:03.718
Hey, that's funny. That's what this
fellow, Dwayne, says he's gonna do.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.219
What? Crumbling coal buckets!

07:06.592 --> 07:08.312
- Wayne!
-The name's Dwayne.

07:08.385 --> 07:09.596
Nobody listens to me.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.727
March it on over here, little man!
Holiday hug time!

07:13.098 --> 07:15.150
- No, no! No, no! No, no, no.
-Come here, come here. Come here.

07:15.516 --> 07:18.151
- Wayne!
-I love him, I love him, I love him.

07:18.228 --> 07:23.032
- Lanny, this is Noel, my little brother.
-Brother?

07:26.443 --> 07:28.116
You two? Brothers?

07:28.279 --> 07:30.117
Yeah! Finally working together.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.125
- Yeah.
-Hey, you're still looking good.

07:32.198 --> 07:34.333
Even with those extra pounds.

07:34.409 --> 07:36.460
Okay, okay. Listen carefully.

07:36.619 --> 07:39.584
Thrasher, the reindeer,
not exactly sociable.

07:39.664 --> 07:42.047
Whatever you do, say nothing.

07:45.168 --> 07:46.259
Hey, Bambi!

07:47.462 --> 07:48.505
Oh, brother!

07:48.588 --> 07:51.518
I told you if I ever saw you again,
I'd put your head on my wall!

07:51.841 --> 07:54.094
You hairy tub of cookie dough.

07:54.176 --> 07:57.723
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't destroy you.

08:03.059 --> 08:04.613
Thanks, Noel, you're the best!

08:05.102 --> 08:07.107
Hey, this Friday,
I'm having a little party.

08:09.607 --> 08:11.942
Jingle-bam! Jingle-bam!

08:13.193 --> 08:14.784
No. Jingle-bam!

08:15.153 --> 08:20.041
The key is to really unclench
and bring it all up from the South Pole.

08:20.116 --> 08:22.251
Jingle-bam!

08:22.326 --> 08:23.370
- Yes!
-Yeah!

08:23.494 --> 08:24.965
I like the Yule in your log, partner.

08:25.413 --> 08:26.623
- You keep bringing it.
-Okay.

08:26.789 --> 08:30.668
Hey, Tree Skirt, you know
who Wayne's first partner was?

08:31.251 --> 08:32.424
Me!

08:32.960 --> 08:35.760
- Yeah. When we were kids...
-Here we go.

08:35.837 --> 08:38.139
...Wayne would dress up
as Captain Avalanche,

08:38.465 --> 08:40.765
and! was his trusty sidekick, Snowball.

08:40.842 --> 08:41.886
Great garland!

08:41.969 --> 08:45.017
Why, we used to battle
all the enemies of the North Pole.

08:45.096 --> 08:49.818
Like Professor Permafrost
and his Army of Evil Nutcrackers.

08:49.892 --> 08:51.898
- Tinsel!
-Hey, Wayne,

08:51.978 --> 08:55.406
remember when they came out
with Captain Avalanche's Super Sled?

08:55.605 --> 08:58.619
The one with the glacier
grappling hook and zip-line action.

08:58.859 --> 09:01.113
Yeah. I remember that thing.

09:01.486 --> 09:03.704
Man, we sure wanted that sled, huh?

09:05.072 --> 09:06.200
We sure did.

09:06.365 --> 09:10.327
Yeah, too bad that Peterson kid
got the last one, huh?

09:10.411 --> 09:16.128
You cried and cried like a baby.
My big brother. The big baby.

09:16.249 --> 09:18.385
All right, all right, look,
time to exit memory lane.

09:18.460 --> 09:19.930
We're on a mission here.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.388
Thrasher, what's our ETA,
big fella? Over.

09:23.464 --> 09:27.343
Do not question me, Dwayne!
I tell you when we're over the drop zone.

09:28.509 --> 09:32.270
Noel, we are over the drop zone.
You go save Christmas, buddy.

09:32.639 --> 09:35.735
Okay, Lanny,
time for an equipment check.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.523
- Parachutes?
-Check.

09:37.643 --> 09:38.936
- Sparkle?
-Check.

09:39.020 --> 09:41.439
- Here's my sparkle.
-Check it out!

09:41.521 --> 09:43.408
This ain't no cotillion, ladies.

09:43.482 --> 09:46.660
We'll need Little Miss Sweet Dreams
here for this naughty kid.

09:46.734 --> 09:47.945
Jingle-bam!

09:48.027 --> 09:49.949
And you guys
are still using parachutes?

09:53.740 --> 09:55.995
Jingle-bam!

10:00.497 --> 10:01.790
Wayne!

10:08.504 --> 10:09.547
No!

10:21.473 --> 10:25.436
We're in the belly of the beast,
my friend. One of us might die.

10:25.769 --> 10:27.027
- Probably gonna be you.
-What?

10:28.146 --> 10:30.317
Okay, let's not be dramatic.

10:31.107 --> 10:32.400
Future Elf of the Year here.

10:33.109 --> 10:34.153
Follow my lead.

10:34.485 --> 10:37.202
After all, stealth is my middle name.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.661
I thought it was Francis.

10:41.658 --> 10:42.702
Do you see what I mean?

10:44.328 --> 10:47.045
Noel might have stomped on this,
and woke up the whole house.

10:47.413 --> 10:48.706
No, wait!

10:51.209 --> 10:52.501
Ho, ho, go!

10:52.668 --> 10:55.551
I broke my bat on Johnny's head
Somebody snitched on me

10:55.629 --> 10:58.643
I hid a frog in sister's bed
Somebody snitched on me

10:58.715 --> 11:01.728
I spilled some ink on Mommy's rug
I made Tommy eat a bug

11:01.801 --> 11:04.600
Bought some gum with a penny slug
Somebody snitched on me

11:04.679 --> 11:07.526
We're in the kill zone!
Serpentine! Serpentine!

11:07.682 --> 11:10.730
Mommy and Daddy are mad

11:11.268 --> 11:13.154
Move, everyone. Move! Move!

11:14.187 --> 11:16.607
- Keep going, Tree Skirt.
-Right behind you!

11:20.526 --> 11:22.116
You make me hoppy.

11:22.319 --> 11:24.704
Stand down. Okay, bunny, let's bounce.

11:26.532 --> 11:28.868
Way to block him with your face!
My turn!

11:31.953 --> 11:33.674
I'll just go get the Fruitcake, then?

11:34.205 --> 11:35.462
I told you I got this.

11:35.998 --> 11:38.502
No pre-school toy
picks on my big brother!

11:38.626 --> 11:43.180
I ain't been nothing but bad

11:57.268 --> 11:58.608
This isn't very tinsel!

12:05.441 --> 12:06.782
I killed the naughty kid!

12:08.736 --> 12:09.779
Lanny!

12:13.281 --> 12:14.456
Jinglesmell?

12:18.202 --> 12:20.706
But you're so adorable.

12:25.167 --> 12:27.338
So, your friends?

12:27.418 --> 12:30.931
They're never gonna
get into my fortress, Santa's Helper!

12:32.215 --> 12:33.389
Jinglesmell?

12:33.466 --> 12:36.894
The name's Goodwin. Grace Goodwin.

12:37.387 --> 12:40.315
Now give me the password
so I can access the database.

12:40.388 --> 12:41.433
Pass-what?

12:41.682 --> 12:44.446
The password so I can take myself
off the Naughty List.

12:45.351 --> 12:47.985
- There it is.
-Okay. Wait for my signal.

12:48.354 --> 12:51.817
Why would I help you
get off the Naughty List?

12:51.982 --> 12:53.619
Boy, that was a lot of sparkle.

12:54.527 --> 12:57.455
'Cause it's not fair.
I'm not the naughty one.

12:58.196 --> 12:59.240
He is.

12:59.531 --> 13:00.919
A baby brother?

13:01.407 --> 13:04.456
Ever since he was born,
Gabriel's messed up everything.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.707
Like one time,
I came home from school,

13:07.788 --> 13:09.959
he totally ripped up Miss Whiskers!

13:10.582 --> 13:12.219
She was my favourite!

13:13.334 --> 13:16.928
And when we went to the mall
so I could ask Santa for a new one,

13:17.004 --> 13:19.934
Gabe just kept crying and crying,
and we had to leave.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.565
Twelve months and two days
since he was born,

13:24.637 --> 13:26.476
and no one's noticed me since.

13:27.013 --> 13:29.232
I need a better vantage point. Cover me.

13:29.307 --> 13:30.648
Hey, I didn't give the...

13:31.434 --> 13:34.981
So don't you understand?
That's why I need the password.

13:35.271 --> 13:38.070
You know what I need? A pizza!

13:38.607 --> 13:41.704
- I'm starving.
-What is it? What is it?

13:41.777 --> 13:44.991
Maybe you just
need to say the magic word.

13:45.404 --> 13:47.540
- Magic word?
-Magic word, magic word, magic word...

13:47.615 --> 13:50.035
Of course! Naughty kids
never use the magic word.

13:52.077 --> 13:53.287
Yes!

13:56.582 --> 13:58.633
Best you don't watch
what happens next.

14:02.546 --> 14:03.589
I did it!

14:04.213 --> 14:05.803
Jingle bells
This is swell

14:05.882 --> 14:08.895
I'm not getting coal
Oh, what fun it is to be

14:08.968 --> 14:10.225
Off the Naughty List

14:13.931 --> 14:14.974
Kringle bytes!

14:17.892 --> 14:20.691
Hey, Noel! We're getting pizza!

14:21.311 --> 14:22.439
You want in?

14:22.522 --> 14:24.941
- Stop! This is my mission.
-No, no, no!

14:26.358 --> 14:27.402
No!

14:29.068 --> 14:30.908
- Give it!
-Come on! Let it go, kid!

14:31.029 --> 14:32.500
It's mine!

14:34.032 --> 14:36.712
- Noel!
-Don't worry! I'll get it, Wayne!

14:39.704 --> 14:41.459
Merry Christmas!

14:48.377 --> 14:50.465
Jingle-bam-a-lam-a-ding-dong.

14:50.587 --> 14:52.391
- Hey, Magee.
-Noel?

14:52.548 --> 14:54.884
Fruitcake in hand.
Mission accomplished.

14:54.966 --> 14:56.937
You just saved Christmas, my friend!

14:57.010 --> 14:59.560
You know what, you'll probably
get Elf of the Year for this.

14:59.638 --> 15:02.437
Roasting chestnuts!
That nerd Thistleton's calling. T-T-Y-L!

15:03.474 --> 15:04.861
Hey, Wayne! Look, I got it.

15:05.268 --> 15:07.569
And now Magee says
I'm gonna be Elf of the Year!

15:08.395 --> 15:09.439
Elf of the Year?

15:09.563 --> 15:11.402
I didn't even know they had that.

15:11.941 --> 15:12.984
This is great.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.117
This is great. Best mission ever.

15:17.820 --> 15:19.208
Great news.

15:19.572 --> 15:20.829
Something wrong with you?

15:21.199 --> 15:24.081
I got to be honest, I've been
getting kind of a vibe over here.

15:25.244 --> 15:27.331
I'll tell you what's wrong with me!

15:27.579 --> 15:29.714
- You!
-Me? What did I do?

15:30.039 --> 15:33.883
You take everything from me!
And I'm sick of you showing me up!

15:34.127 --> 15:36.214
I'm sensing a lot of
pent up hostility, Wayne.

15:37.087 --> 15:38.677
"Pent up"?

15:38.755 --> 15:41.970
Hey, if this is about Dolores,
I told you, I never saw the mistletoe!

15:42.091 --> 15:46.932
It's about Dolores, it's about the Turbo,
it's about all of it!

15:47.096 --> 15:49.267
But it's been so great
being together on this mission!

15:49.515 --> 15:51.436
This mission is a disaster!

15:51.600 --> 15:54.317
I didn't want you along.
I never wanted you along.

15:54.394 --> 15:56.695
I wish I never had a brother!

16:00.191 --> 16:01.698
I know you didn't mean that!

16:05.321 --> 16:06.958
Tell me you didn't mean it, Wayne.

16:11.409 --> 16:13.130
Tell me you didn't mean it.

16:15.622 --> 16:20.426
You know, ever since I was born,
I looked up to you.

16:21.460 --> 16:24.046
You knew how to build a snow fort,
skate backwards,

16:24.130 --> 16:27.308
write your name in the snow.

16:27.382 --> 16:29.055
You were my hero.

16:30.343 --> 16:31.387
Hero?

16:36.056 --> 16:37.528
Until now.

16:38.142 --> 16:39.186
Merry Christmas.

16:44.439 --> 16:45.613
The Super Sled.

16:48.192 --> 16:49.236
You found one?

16:56.783 --> 16:59.713
Well, I forgot
how amazing this thing was.

17:03.664 --> 17:09.346
You know, Captain Avalanche,
he's nothing without Snowball.

17:10.587 --> 17:12.971
Never has been, and never will be.

17:14.423 --> 17:15.847
You got that right.

17:17.510 --> 17:18.801
I'm sorry, Noel.

17:20.387 --> 17:21.432
Jingle-bam?

17:22.765 --> 17:25.232
- Jingle-bam! Come here!
-Okay!

17:26.477 --> 17:29.360
Hey, is that pizza here, yet?

17:32.356 --> 17:33.448
Hello, beautiful.

17:33.524 --> 17:34.996
Please tell me
you still have that Fruitcake.

17:35.068 --> 17:36.194
Got it right here.

17:36.526 --> 17:37.868
Well, it's causing bigger problems now.

17:37.945 --> 17:40.281
Somehow the database has been fried,
and because of that...

17:40.363 --> 17:44.041
Every child on Earth
is going on the Naughty List!

17:45.577 --> 17:46.703
Frostbite!

17:48.329 --> 17:51.792
As I've said, every child
is being transferred to the Naughty List

17:51.874 --> 17:54.294
and I am unable
to interface with the Fruitcake.

17:54.793 --> 17:56.798
Maybe because the antenna's broken?

17:57.378 --> 17:59.965
Okay, in that case,
you need to re-wire the FCC

18:00.048 --> 18:02.183
and piggyback it
to the most powerful antenna

18:02.259 --> 18:04.559
you can locate to reverse the damage.

18:05.053 --> 18:06.310
This is all my fault.

18:06.387 --> 18:08.522
Where are we gonna find
an antenna that strong?

18:08.597 --> 18:10.852
Hey, what about that one?

18:14.060 --> 18:16.740
First you will need to bypass
the internal motherboard.

18:16.812 --> 18:19.529
Did that already.
I'm reassigning the main battery

18:19.606 --> 18:21.113
to power the manual sync.

18:21.191 --> 18:23.908
Yes. Well, I was just going to say that.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.493
Wire cutters, please.

18:26.112 --> 18:27.750
This is a bumpy sleigh ride!

18:27.906 --> 18:29.247
Hey, it's ready.

18:29.657 --> 18:31.211
Thanks, kid. Nice work.

18:31.493 --> 18:32.536
Wayne!

18:34.578 --> 18:36.334
I'm sorry for being so naughty.

18:36.914 --> 18:39.927
Hey, always be your brother's hero.

18:41.585 --> 18:43.340
Hey, wait for me, I'm...

18:44.754 --> 18:46.557
Worldwide Naughty List at 75%.

18:46.631 --> 18:48.267
Make the numbers go down, genius!

18:48.424 --> 18:49.681
The Tree Farm is overloading.

18:50.009 --> 18:52.228
It was never designed
for this much naughtiness.

18:52.303 --> 18:55.850
If levels reach 100%
Christmas will be ruined!

18:58.391 --> 18:59.684
Come on.

19:04.897 --> 19:07.365
This way, follow me.

19:08.233 --> 19:09.574
UP you go!

19:10.985 --> 19:12.907
Man, are you heavy!

19:14.113 --> 19:17.411
Just like the fortress
of Professor Permafrost.

19:18.034 --> 19:19.754
Race you to the top, Snowball.

19:22.413 --> 19:23.456
Come on!

19:24.998 --> 19:26.041
This way!

19:26.833 --> 19:27.877
93%.

19:28.251 --> 19:29.638
94%.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.099
We can't get through there!

19:41.137 --> 19:42.608
The Super Sled can!

19:42.680 --> 19:45.149
With glacier grappling hook
and zip-line action.

19:46.434 --> 19:48.071
Here. You're the better shot.

19:50.313 --> 19:51.902
I can't get a clear view.

19:53.231 --> 19:55.532
Hurry, Wayne. We're at 97.

19:55.859 --> 19:56.902
Ninety-eight!

19:57.819 --> 19:58.863
Holiday hug.

20:05.201 --> 20:06.837
Good thing
you're still using parachutes!

20:07.286 --> 20:08.329
Yeah.

20:08.453 --> 20:09.497
Jingle-bam!

20:18.796 --> 20:23.434
96%. Ninety-four.
Levels returning to normal, baby.

20:23.508 --> 20:25.644
- I mean...
-Come here, nerd!

20:26.970 --> 20:28.310
Oh, my!

20:32.141 --> 20:34.561
- We did it!
-Yeah!

20:41.274 --> 20:45.699
A new Miss Whiskers!
Merry Christmas, Gabriel!

20:46.112 --> 20:47.784
Well, look at that.

20:48.990 --> 20:52.619
There's no better gift than family,
is there?

20:53.244 --> 20:54.833
Thanks for teaming us up, sir.

20:55.371 --> 20:56.923
Best present I ever got.

20:57.205 --> 20:59.091
Well done, lads.

21:00.583 --> 21:04.758
We'd better get a move on.
Don't want to be late, do we?

21:06.463 --> 21:10.224
And congratulations
to Wayne and Noel!

21:10.926 --> 21:12.266
- Jingle-bam!
-Jingle-bam!

21:13.386 --> 21:15.391
- Merry Christmas!
-Way to go, guys!

21:15.554 --> 21:17.108
Elves of the year!

21:19.559 --> 21:21.065
Told you his name was Dwayne.

21:26.606 --> 21:30.403
We're gonna turn you round
One lump of coal at a time

21:30.860 --> 21:32.367
Oh, you naughty children!
