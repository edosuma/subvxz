00:18.852 --> 00:20.683
It's alive!

00:42.675 --> 00:45.838
Morning bear,
are you having smoke sex?

00:47.280 --> 00:49.271
No.

00:52.752 --> 00:54.049
What a day!

00:54.087 --> 00:58.285
It's exhausting
being the CEO of Burger King.

01:03.663 --> 01:07.326
Hello? Hello?
Is anyone there?

01:08.368 --> 01:10.359
Damn it.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.741
Hello. Who is this?

01:15.775 --> 01:19.233
I'm the CEO of Burger King, you know.

01:22.248 --> 01:23.738
What was that?

01:24.951 --> 01:26.213
Who's there?

01:30.690 --> 01:32.715
Must have just been my...

01:32.759 --> 01:36.320
I'm flame-broiling in my pants!

01:40.834 --> 01:42.426
My arm!

01:46.806 --> 01:48.899
Die, you son of a bitch!

01:50.977 --> 01:52.535
What? No!

01:52.912 --> 01:56.006
I've killed my only son!

01:56.049 --> 02:01.077
If only Philip had lived to taste
the Triple Bacon King Burger...

02:01.121 --> 02:04.147
now on sale
at participating locations.

02:04.924 --> 02:07.518
The new Triple Bacon King Burger.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.357
Spend your nights with the King.

02:09.395 --> 02:10.987
Philip!

02:13.233 --> 02:15.064
Don't cross the streams, man.

02:16.536 --> 02:18.436
- Mein teacher?
- Yes, li'I Hitler?

02:18.471 --> 02:22.635
Mein desk is small.
I need this Polish boy's desk, also.

02:24.511 --> 02:27.503
Everyone gets
the same size desk, li'I Hitler.

02:29.516 --> 02:32.246
¤ Li'I Hitler, such a scamp! ¤

02:35.522 --> 02:38.389
Here it is, the book of your life.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.887
Just ask the book
any question about your life...

02:43.930 --> 02:46.558
and the answer shall be revealed.

02:49.869 --> 02:51.302
How many days did I live?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.973
Cool!
How many hours is that?

02:54.007 --> 02:58.239
It's not a calculator.
This is the book of your life.

02:58.278 --> 03:02.009
How many times did I hear the song
I Touch Myself by The Divinyls?

03:03.183 --> 03:05.947
I thought it would be more than that.

03:05.985 --> 03:08.886
Why not ask the book
about your actions on earth...

03:08.922 --> 03:11.186
and how they impacted
your loved ones?

03:11.224 --> 03:12.213
In a minute.

03:12.258 --> 03:16.661
Book, if I made bricks
out of all the poop I ever pooped out...

03:16.696 --> 03:19.256
and built a 6-foot high wall
out of the bricks...

03:19.299 --> 03:20.891
how long could I make that wall?

03:21.968 --> 03:24.198
This is ridiculous.
Book, tell this man...

03:24.237 --> 03:27.468
how many moments of happiness
he gave his friends and family.

03:27.507 --> 03:28.804
Boring! Book...

03:28.841 --> 03:32.106
could I have filled the Empire
State building with my own poop?

03:32.145 --> 03:34.238
- Don't answer that, book.
- I want to know!

03:34.280 --> 03:36.540
- No!
- Yes!

03:36.583 --> 03:37.709
That does it!

03:39.986 --> 03:43.251
- 2.7 miles?!
- I know!

03:44.090 --> 03:45.819
- Now, class...
- Mein teacher?

03:45.858 --> 03:49.350
I will need
the Czechoslovakian boy's desk as well.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.523
Li'I Hitler, where's little Polaski?

03:53.566 --> 03:56.433
¤ Li'I Hitler, always having fun! ¤

03:56.836 --> 03:59.464
Cat Court is now in session.

03:59.505 --> 04:03.066
We will now hear the case
of Garfield vs. Heathcliff.

04:12.018 --> 04:16.351
I was in the funny papers five years
before this lame knockoff.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.482
Judge, if I might.

04:18.524 --> 04:21.822
I'd like to present this affidavit.

04:22.862 --> 04:26.298
Sorry, your honor.
I'm on a lasagna diet.

04:26.332 --> 04:29.768
I see lasagna, I eat it.

04:31.738 --> 04:34.366
That joke sucks, even for you!

04:34.407 --> 04:36.705
Court agrees. That joke sucked.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.371
Gentlemen,
I'm afraid we are at a standstill.

04:39.412 --> 04:42.142
There's only one fair way
to settle this argument.

04:42.181 --> 04:43.170
Cat fight!

04:46.519 --> 04:49.511
You want a piece of me?
Come on, fat boy!

04:49.555 --> 04:51.785
Come and get it, cat.

04:54.761 --> 04:57.992
Open your eyes all the way, you lazy fuck.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.664
I'm gonna start calling you "Monday. "

05:01.701 --> 05:04.465
I hate Mondays.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.548
I'm dying!

05:17.583 --> 05:19.915
I'm so cute and I'm dying!

05:21.120 --> 05:23.850
Eat it, eat it! Die, die!

05:24.924 --> 05:27.290
Enough! We have a champion.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.955
The court rules in favor of Garfield.

05:33.032 --> 05:35.364
Heart attack...

05:35.401 --> 05:39.269
from decades of only eating.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.365
I'm sorry.

05:42.408 --> 05:45.343
I just couldn't take
another freaking lasagna joke.

05:45.378 --> 05:49.041
Gods be praised, I'm free!
Free!

05:49.082 --> 05:52.609
Up next, Cat Court hears the assault case
against Chester Cheetah.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.746
He hankered for a hunk of my ass!

06:03.096 --> 06:06.031
It's no big deal.
It's probably not even quicksand.

06:06.065 --> 06:09.398
I'll have a good laugh about this
tonight with the guys.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.767
Well, this is just fucking perfect!

06:16.809 --> 06:21.269
Stupid quicksand! Stupid jungle!
I want to bite someone in the face!

06:21.314 --> 06:26.149
Motherfucker! Motherfucker! Motherfucker!

06:26.185 --> 06:29.154
You stupid jungle! Oh, fuck!

06:32.125 --> 06:35.754
Are you there, God?
It's me, giraffe.

06:35.795 --> 06:40.129
Listen, if you would just give me
a mulligan on this quicksand thing...

06:40.166 --> 06:45.160
I promise no more peeing
on your shorter creatures. We got a deal?

07:02.655 --> 07:04.452
Mommy.

07:07.527 --> 07:10.223
You know something?
I'm cool with this.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.892
I'll bet heaven has
all the tender leaves I can eat...

07:13.933 --> 07:16.561
and everyone gets
their own slurpee machine.

07:16.602 --> 07:22.097
Yeah, take me, sweet death.
I await your loving embrace.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.604
What?

07:24.644 --> 07:27.135
I think I hit the bottom.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.772
Fuck!

07:39.125 --> 07:40.524
What's going on here?

07:42.528 --> 07:44.462
This is not my problem.

07:46.666 --> 07:49.066
Now it's my problem.

07:49.101 --> 07:51.797
¤ Li'I Hitler ¤
¤ Achtung blitzkrieg! ¤

07:52.205 --> 07:53.297
Look sharp, team.

07:53.339 --> 07:56.206
Remember, my X-Men,
use extreme caution.

07:56.242 --> 07:59.234
- This is your most dangerous mission yet.
- Right, professor!

08:04.250 --> 08:05.512
Is it OK if I delete...

08:05.551 --> 08:08.019
Real World Road Rules Challenge
off the TIVO...

08:08.054 --> 08:11.353
because it's been a...
I'm going to need some new students.

08:11.390 --> 08:14.587
Welcome, recruits.
Though we've had to lower our standards...

08:14.627 --> 08:18.996
thanks to a shortage of actual mutants,
the dangers you'll face are no less real.

08:19.031 --> 08:22.091
You'll be defending a world
that hates and fears you.

08:22.134 --> 08:24.864
What? Hate and fear us
because we're mutants?

08:24.904 --> 08:27.896
No, because you were
in the Police Academy movies.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.578
What the hell is wrong with this chair?

08:33.613 --> 08:36.410
And it seems we're missing one recruit.

08:40.052 --> 08:43.578
- Sorry I'm late.
- Mahoney!

08:43.623 --> 08:47.650
This is the Danger Room,
the ultimate training facility.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.456
You never know what you might face.

08:49.495 --> 08:53.363
Killer death rays,
flying bow saws, inflatable bags.

08:53.399 --> 08:54.388
Let's begin.

09:01.107 --> 09:02.972
Hello, my robot brother.

09:03.009 --> 09:06.604
I'm Lardell Jones.
Destroy all humanoids.

09:09.115 --> 09:12.346
Excuse me, please stop that.

09:12.385 --> 09:16.082
Hooks! You're an X-Man. Act like one.

09:16.656 --> 09:19.181
Who wants a piece of me, dirtbags?!

09:20.226 --> 09:22.956
For heaven's sake,
get that body to the morgue.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.929
Move it, move it, move it!

09:31.671 --> 09:36.165
Hightower, we haven't got all day.
Well, that's horrifying.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.108
These battle outfits are stylish...

09:38.144 --> 09:41.079
temperature-controlled,
and best of all bulletproof.

09:41.113 --> 09:44.014
- Awesome!
- Tackleberry, no!

09:44.050 --> 09:47.577
Of course, they can only protect
the parts of you they actually cover.

09:49.155 --> 09:50.816
Stupid chair!

09:51.857 --> 09:54.655
You! It's been you all along!

09:54.694 --> 09:56.719
Try making your cute sound effects...

09:56.762 --> 09:59.595
with a telepathically erased brain.

10:04.704 --> 10:08.640
Welcome new graduates
of Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters.

10:08.674 --> 10:09.971
He's in for a surprise.

10:10.009 --> 10:13.843
As X-Men, you now carry
the great responsibility of...

10:14.880 --> 10:17.542
Some mischief maker
has gone to great lengths...

10:17.583 --> 10:19.551
to hide a prostitute under my podium.

10:19.585 --> 10:23.077
Unfortunately, I'm paralyzed
from the waist down...

10:23.122 --> 10:25.989
and her enthusiastic efforts
are quite for naught.

10:26.025 --> 10:29.051
As I was saying, the X-men...
I didn't say stop.

10:29.095 --> 10:30.323
Look sharp, team.

10:30.363 --> 10:33.196
Remember, my X-Men,
use extreme caution.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.867
Oh, well.
Same time next week?

10:39.538 --> 10:42.666
¤ Yeah, yeah, yeah! Robot Chicken y'all! ¤

10:55.254 --> 10:56.516
Shake it.

10:58.357 --> 10:59.915
Robot Chicken!
