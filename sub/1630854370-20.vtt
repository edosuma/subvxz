01:18.965 --> 01:20.517
I hear it's lonely
at the top Joe.

01:20.517 --> 01:21.275
Ah come on.

01:21.275 --> 01:22.310
I'm moving

Yeah!

01:33.068 --> 01:34.620
It's got kind of a nice
ring to it, doesn't it?

01:35.448 --> 01:36.413
So what's first
item of business?

01:36.413 --> 01:37.137
I don't know.

01:37.137 --> 01:38.137
Probably rubbing elbows.

01:38.137 --> 01:40.103
Department brass
have a table

01:40.103 --> 01:41.793

Charity Gala tomorrow night.

01:41.793 --> 01:43.000
Thousand dollars a plate.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.137
That is some
good salmon.

01:45.793 --> 01:46.965
Come on.

01:46.965 --> 01:47.965
Next round's on me.

01:48.482 --> 01:49.965
I actually
have to call it.

01:49.965 --> 01:51.206
Charlie did you
still want a ride?

01:51.206 --> 01:52.827
Yeah I'm going to
stick around for a bit.

01:52.827 --> 01:53.862
Okay, well boss-

01:53.862 --> 01:54.758
I just want
to say

01:54.758 --> 01:57.241
that working
for you has- um

01:57.241 --> 01:58.758
it's mattered.

01:59.310 --> 02:00.689
It's mattered
a lot to me.

02:02.206 --> 02:02.862
Hey-

02:02.862 --> 02:04.551
Jesse.

02:06.206 --> 02:06.896
I appreciate it.

02:06.896 --> 02:08.413
But don't worry.

02:08.413 --> 02:10.034
I'll see you every morning
at the Mugshot right?

02:10.034 --> 02:11.482
Yes, definitely.

02:11.482 --> 02:12.344
Okay, I'll
see you guys.

02:12.344 --> 02:13.586
Okay.

02:13.586 --> 02:15.793
Good night.

02:16.275 --> 02:17.517
Everyone
drinking the same thing?

02:17.517 --> 02:19.241
I'll pay for
rides home too.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.241
Hey, hey!

02:21.241 --> 02:21.931
Hey stop!

02:21.931 --> 02:22.620
That's my car!

02:22.620 --> 02:24.034
Get away
from my car!

02:24.034 --> 02:25.034
That's- whoah!

02:25.034 --> 02:25.724
Are you okay?

02:25.724 --> 02:28.482
He's trying to
take my car!

02:28.482 --> 02:29.586
SJPD!

02:29.586 --> 02:30.413
Stay away
from the vehicle!

02:39.379 --> 02:42.275
Somebody's
been shot!

02:42.275 --> 02:43.310
Help me!

02:44.206 --> 02:45.241
What happened?

02:45.241 --> 02:46.413
We heard gunshots!

02:48.137 --> 02:48.931
It's Jesse!

02:48.931 --> 02:49.965
Call an ambulance!

02:56.517 --> 02:57.517
He's not breathing.

02:59.896 --> 03:01.793
That's a
lot of blood Sarah.

03:16.275 --> 03:18.241
28-29-30!

03:20.448 --> 03:21.137
Come on, breathe Jesse!

03:21.137 --> 03:22.000
Come on, come on!

03:23.137 --> 03:24.310
Go
go go go go!

03:24.310 --> 03:25.379
Keep going, keep going!

03:25.379 --> 03:26.551
What the hell is
taking the police?

03:27.310 --> 03:28.068
Come on.

03:28.068 --> 03:28.862
Come on Jesse,
come on.

03:28.862 --> 03:30.448
Come on,
do this now okay?

03:31.689 --> 03:33.724
Jesse, just start breathing.

03:33.724 --> 03:35.206
Come on, come on!

03:38.206 --> 03:39.448
28-29-30!

03:52.655 --> 03:53.379
Ahhh!

03:53.965 --> 03:55.172
Aghh!

03:55.172 --> 03:56.172
28-29-

03:56.172 --> 03:57.000
30!

03:58.275 --> 03:59.586
I've
got a pulse!

03:59.586 --> 04:01.413
Ahh okay!

04:01.413 --> 04:02.103
Come on.

04:02.103 --> 04:02.965
It's good, it's good!

04:02.965 --> 04:05.172
We've got a pulse!

04:10.862 --> 04:12.000
One gunshot wound
to the chest.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
One to the abdomen.

04:13.000 --> 04:13.931
He's lost lots
of blood.

04:14.827 --> 04:16.275
I'm Dr. Sarah
Truong by the way.

04:16.275 --> 04:17.137
I'm riding with you.

04:17.965 --> 04:19.068
I'm
right behind you.

04:19.068 --> 04:20.586
Charlie, update
me in my car!

04:20.586 --> 04:21.275
Yeah.

04:21.275 --> 04:22.000
Okay.

04:22.000 --> 04:22.724
I'm sorry.

04:22.724 --> 04:23.793
Go ahead.

04:23.793 --> 04:25.793
I came out of the bar and
he was opening my car.

04:26.586 --> 04:27.586
And I yelled
at him.

04:27.586 --> 04:29.000
I didn't see
that he had a gun

04:29.000 --> 04:30.206
or I would have
left him alone.

04:30.206 --> 04:31.689
No that's okay.

04:31.689 --> 04:32.931
Is that when
Jesse came out?

04:32.931 --> 04:33.724
Right.

04:33.724 --> 04:35.448
He identified
himself as a cop.

04:35.448 --> 04:37.206
And then-

04:37.206 --> 04:38.103
It all happened
so fast.

04:39.482 --> 04:40.827
And then he shot Jesse
and drove away?

04:40.827 --> 04:41.551
Right.

04:42.206 --> 04:43.137
Did he take
your keys?

04:43.137 --> 04:44.448
No.

04:44.448 --> 04:45.517
I have them
right here.

04:45.517 --> 04:46.896
And I'm sure that
I locked the car.

04:46.896 --> 04:48.000
Describe the
guy for me.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.206
What happened?

04:49.206 --> 04:50.517
He was wearing
a hoodie.

04:52.448 --> 04:53.586
And maybe black
hair or brown?

04:53.586 --> 04:55.137
I don't know, I didn't
really see his face.

04:56.206 --> 04:57.137
Height? Weight?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.068
Not a big guy.

05:00.931 --> 05:01.896
Excuse me.

05:26.620 --> 05:29.517
Dr. Andrews,
recovery please.

05:29.517 --> 05:31.275
Dr. Andrews,
report to recovery

05:31.275 --> 05:32.172
Hey Rex.

05:36.206 --> 05:36.931
Hey.

05:36.931 --> 05:38.000
How's he doing?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.655
He's still in surgery.

05:39.655 --> 05:41.517
All of this
over a car.

06:24.586 --> 06:25.275
Anything?

06:27.862 --> 06:29.103
No sign
of the car.

06:30.241 --> 06:32.379
I'm going through
recent car theft arrests.

06:32.379 --> 06:33.448
Anything with guns?

06:33.448 --> 06:34.344
No.

06:34.344 --> 06:36.310
Just joyriding, some
broken windows.

06:36.310 --> 06:37.482
Stolen keys.

06:37.482 --> 06:38.482
But in Jesse's case-

06:38.482 --> 06:40.758
the thief got the car
open without keys.

06:41.517 --> 06:43.965
So do we think that he
copied the owner's fob?

06:43.965 --> 06:45.689
Well she was at the
bar for a few hours.

06:45.689 --> 06:46.793
Plenty of time

06:46.793 --> 06:48.034
to get close enough
to her to copy them.

06:48.034 --> 06:50.241
Yeah, well usually that's a
pretty seamless process right?

06:50.931 --> 06:52.034
Cars are often gone

06:52.034 --> 06:54.034
before the owner's even
realized that they're gone.

06:54.034 --> 06:55.862
In this case-

06:55.862 --> 06:57.689
the thief was interrupted.

06:57.689 --> 06:58.689
Yeah.

06:58.689 --> 07:00.551
And he shot a cop so
he could steal a car.

07:00.551 --> 07:02.068
He's either stupid
or desperate.

07:02.068 --> 07:03.655
Well the shooting
was stupid, no doubt.

07:03.655 --> 07:06.379
But the tech is
pretty expensive.

07:08.586 --> 07:10.448
Which suggest
a bigger operation

07:10.448 --> 07:12.689
than just a
kid in a hoodie.

07:12.689 --> 07:13.931
Right.

07:13.931 --> 07:16.206
Did you show the mugshots to
the witness from last night?

07:16.206 --> 07:17.379
Yeah, I went
by her house.

07:17.379 --> 07:18.793
She didn't
recognize anyone.

07:18.793 --> 07:22.517
But I'm hoping that Jesse
will as soon as he wakes up.

07:27.206 --> 07:29.000
Rex hasn't left Jesse's
desk all morning.

07:38.448 --> 07:39.620
Nurse Jamieson.

07:39.620 --> 07:43.241
Please report to the nurses'
third floor station.

07:43.241 --> 07:44.068
Dr. Kelly.

07:45.068 --> 07:46.068
How is he?

07:47.517 --> 07:48.620
Is he going
to be okay?

07:48.620 --> 07:50.551
Dr. Kelly: One of the
bullets hit his lung.

07:50.551 --> 07:52.793
A second bullet damaged the
superior mesenteric artery.

07:53.551 --> 07:55.413
That accounts for
the blood loss.

07:55.413 --> 07:57.965
We'll monitor him closely.

07:58.689 --> 08:00.793
You asked for
the bullets.

08:01.620 --> 08:02.655
Thank you.

08:19.551 --> 08:20.344
Sarah.

08:20.827 --> 08:21.620
Hey.

08:22.517 --> 08:24.034
The bullet's from
a semi-automatic.

08:24.034 --> 08:26.896
But the ballistics didn't match
anything in the database.

08:26.896 --> 08:28.379
Okay I'll check with
registered owners

08:28.379 --> 08:29.275
and see if
anything connects.

08:30.034 --> 08:31.000
Sure.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.379
There was a
partial print

08:32.379 --> 08:35.310
on the cartridge they
found at the scene.

08:35.310 --> 08:36.172
Well I'm taking

08:36.172 --> 08:37.275
there wasn't a match.

08:37.275 --> 08:38.482
Otherwise you would
have led with that.

08:38.482 --> 08:39.689
No.

08:40.827 --> 08:41.827
But-

08:43.206 --> 08:45.586
according to this-

08:45.586 --> 08:50.413
there were traces of lavender
hand cream on that cartridge.

08:50.413 --> 08:51.344
Lavender hand cream?

08:53.448 --> 08:54.551
Have you called
Jesse's sister?

08:55.241 --> 08:56.551
I did.

08:57.448 --> 09:01.034
I told her that he's going to
come through it all right but-

09:03.517 --> 09:04.965
Charlie, I don't know.

09:06.241 --> 09:07.137
Yeah.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.724
It's the hospital.

09:16.206 --> 09:17.034
Hi.

09:17.034 --> 09:17.862
Yes.

09:17.862 --> 09:19.413
We'll be right there.

09:19.413 --> 09:20.517
Thanks.

09:21.448 --> 09:22.448
What?

09:22.448 --> 09:23.310
Jesse's awake.

09:46.241 --> 09:46.896
Hey!

09:46.896 --> 09:48.034
Hey.

09:53.344 --> 09:56.103
Oh we're so relieved
to see you Jesse.

10:01.034 --> 10:01.724
Yeah me too.

10:01.724 --> 10:02.551
Yeah.

10:02.551 --> 10:03.620
Yeah!

10:07.620 --> 10:08.310
Jesse.

10:08.310 --> 10:09.206
Do you
think you can

10:10.689 --> 10:11.965
take us through
what you saw?

10:12.793 --> 10:15.000
I just made
a mistake.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.586
I should have
called for backup.

10:16.586 --> 10:17.620
No no, you-

10:17.620 --> 10:18.862
Jesse you might have
saved that woman's life.

10:21.241 --> 10:23.862
Do you remember anything
about the shooter?

10:23.862 --> 10:24.827
I um-

10:26.827 --> 10:27.551
I don't know.

10:27.551 --> 10:29.068
I just um-

10:32.689 --> 10:33.655
I recognize him.

10:33.655 --> 10:34.586
I think I
recognize him.

10:34.586 --> 10:35.793
You recognize him?

10:35.793 --> 10:36.586
Where from?

10:36.586 --> 10:38.344
I um-

10:38.344 --> 10:39.103
I think-

10:39.103 --> 10:41.344
I've seen him

10:41.344 --> 10:42.931
walking around
with a woman- a girl.

10:42.931 --> 10:45.448
They're always together.

10:45.448 --> 10:47.206
Could be his girlfriend.

10:47.206 --> 10:48.620
I don't know.

10:48.620 --> 10:49.517
Guys, I just-

10:49.517 --> 10:50.551
I can't remember.

10:50.551 --> 10:51.655
Okay.

10:51.655 --> 10:53.310
Is it any of these
guys here?

10:53.310 --> 10:55.000
Take a look.

10:59.172 --> 11:01.310
Who are these people?

11:02.655 --> 11:04.724
Well they're people
who have prior arrests

11:04.724 --> 11:06.379
for vehicle theft.

11:06.379 --> 11:07.586
Vehicle theft?

11:07.586 --> 11:08.344
Mm-hmm.

11:08.344 --> 11:09.931
Did my car
stolen again?

11:13.827 --> 11:14.620
Hey Rex!

11:16.068 --> 11:17.241
Hey I didn't even
see him there.

11:21.793 --> 11:23.000
He's just getting confused.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.310
It's normal
for post-op.

11:24.310 --> 11:26.000
But we should
let him rest.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.551
Jesse did you recognize the
man from inside the pub?

11:30.551 --> 11:31.448
I can't remember Charlie.

11:31.448 --> 11:32.241
I'm sorry.

11:33.000 --> 11:33.793
It's okay.

11:34.896 --> 11:35.965
You know what?

11:35.965 --> 11:37.275
The important thing
is that you get better.

11:37.275 --> 11:38.000
Yeah.

11:39.068 --> 11:40.724
I'm sorry guys.

11:43.344 --> 11:44.862
You think Jesse
recognized the shooter?

11:44.862 --> 11:46.379
It's hard to
know for sure.

11:46.379 --> 11:47.931
But he mentioned something
about a girlfriend.

11:47.931 --> 11:49.413
And Sarah found
hand cream

11:49.413 --> 11:51.551
on the bullet casings
at the scene.

11:51.551 --> 11:54.000
Okay so someone would
have to get close to the owner

11:54.000 --> 11:55.793
in order to
copy the fob.

11:55.793 --> 11:56.724
Yeah.

11:56.724 --> 11:57.482
You're thinking what-

11:57.482 --> 11:59.000
a female accomplice?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.724
I mean guys can wear
hand cream too, but-

12:00.724 --> 12:01.620
I mean-
it's a stretch.

12:01.620 --> 12:02.827
Okay hold
on a second.

12:02.827 --> 12:05.000
This is the list of all the
auto thefts in St. John's

12:05.000 --> 12:06.172
over the past while.

12:06.172 --> 12:08.689
They've tripled in
the last three weeks.

12:08.689 --> 12:11.586
They're taking them from
bars, parking lots, driveways.

12:11.586 --> 12:12.551
But most
of the time-

12:12.551 --> 12:14.206
it says here that
people don't see them.

12:14.206 --> 12:14.965
Most of the time-

12:14.965 --> 12:15.827
But there are
some witnesses?

12:15.827 --> 12:16.758
Yeah there's a couple.

12:16.758 --> 12:17.517
Here here.

12:17.517 --> 12:18.241
Look at the statements.

12:18.241 --> 12:19.000
Yeah.

12:20.034 --> 12:21.172
Uh, let's see.

12:21.172 --> 12:23.724
Late model luxury vehicles.

12:23.724 --> 12:26.344
High resale value,
especially overseas.

12:26.344 --> 12:28.551
Yeah so they're shipping
them out of St. John's.

12:28.551 --> 12:30.310
I'm going to follow up
with all of these witnesses.

12:35.551 --> 12:36.689
Walter Wales?

12:37.862 --> 12:39.586
Detective Hudson, SJPD.

12:39.586 --> 12:41.793
Yeah you called
me about the stolen car.

12:41.793 --> 12:42.896
That's right.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.551
You said in your statement
you got a look at the man.

12:44.551 --> 12:46.517
Yes yes, from my office.

12:46.517 --> 12:47.724
Short guy, hoodie.

12:47.724 --> 12:49.000
Track pants.

12:49.000 --> 12:49.758
You find the car?

12:50.724 --> 12:51.413
No.

12:51.413 --> 12:53.172
Insurance said they wouldn't.

12:53.172 --> 12:54.655
Listen-
the day of the theft-

12:54.655 --> 12:56.896
did you encounter
a stranger?

12:56.896 --> 12:57.793
Someone-

12:57.793 --> 12:59.000
that you hadn't
met before?

13:00.344 --> 13:03.137
No, I was in the
office all day.

13:07.172 --> 13:08.413
Listen it's
a cold day.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.517
Um- if your
wife didn't

13:09.517 --> 13:11.068
witness the theft-

13:11.068 --> 13:12.965
maybe she'd be more comfortable
waiting in the car?

13:12.965 --> 13:14.344
Of course.

13:15.310 --> 13:16.172
My dear.

13:19.413 --> 13:20.379
We'll just be
a minute.

13:23.517 --> 13:24.448
Did you happen to-

13:24.448 --> 13:26.448
meet a woman the day
your car was stolen?

13:27.655 --> 13:30.724
You know if I mentioned
that in front of my wife-

13:30.724 --> 13:32.551
it would have ruined
the rest of my day.

13:32.551 --> 13:33.310
Sure.

13:33.310 --> 13:35.620
Tell me about
the woman.

13:35.620 --> 13:37.689
I went over and
had lunch at Élan.

13:37.689 --> 13:40.137
I was at the bar,
having a steak.

13:40.137 --> 13:42.758
One martini in,
and this woman-

13:42.758 --> 13:44.068
well, she started
flirting with me.

13:45.689 --> 13:46.827
You get a name?

13:46.827 --> 13:48.000
No.

13:49.586 --> 13:50.931
Pretty.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.310
Brunette.

13:52.310 --> 13:53.517
30s.

13:53.517 --> 13:54.517
Mmmm!

13:56.655 --> 13:57.379
My God.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.586
You think this woman

13:58.586 --> 14:00.931
had something to do
with my stolen car!

14:00.931 --> 14:03.482
She may have
copied your car fob.

14:03.482 --> 14:04.655
Son of a gun.

14:06.172 --> 14:07.172
Well you know
what Detective?

14:07.172 --> 14:09.896
I really don't need
this to go any further.

14:11.241 --> 14:12.310
After all-

14:12.310 --> 14:14.206
the insurance company
paid out on the car anyway!

14:14.206 --> 14:15.206
What?

14:16.206 --> 14:17.206
Yes?

14:18.172 --> 14:20.000
Thanks Detective.

14:20.000 --> 14:20.862
Right.

14:21.827 --> 14:23.310
Come on Rex.

14:31.413 --> 14:32.413
I heard about Jesse.

14:32.620 --> 14:34.103
I am so sorry.

14:34.103 --> 14:35.137
How is he doing?

14:35.137 --> 14:36.862
Well he's almost
out of the woods.

14:36.862 --> 14:38.172
Or so we hope.

14:38.172 --> 14:40.310
Everybody's rooting for him.

14:40.310 --> 14:41.310
Even the guys
on my team.

14:41.310 --> 14:42.034
Ha.

14:42.034 --> 14:42.724
Even them huh?

14:42.724 --> 14:43.482
Yeah!

14:43.482 --> 14:44.413
Something like this happens-

14:44.413 --> 14:45.344
and they're
willing to forget

14:45.344 --> 14:47.137
how many times
Mills showed them up.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.034
Right.

14:48.034 --> 14:48.724
Listen Vanessa.

14:48.724 --> 14:49.620
I'm on
my way out.

14:49.620 --> 14:50.793
Do you want to
walk with me?

14:50.793 --> 14:52.206
Yeah but you know-

14:52.206 --> 14:54.482
I just left a
strategy meeting, okay?

14:54.482 --> 14:56.482
And the police
commissioner was there.

14:56.482 --> 14:57.896
And he was asking
where you were.

14:58.827 --> 14:59.862
He heard about Jesse?

14:59.862 --> 15:03.517
Yeah and he said that
your focus and priority

15:03.517 --> 15:04.655
needs to be on
the department.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.448
Not just one team.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.137
Well my first day as
interim police chief.

15:08.137 --> 15:09.827
And I'm already in
the principal's office.

15:09.827 --> 15:11.689
Yeah well I never said
that I agreed with him.

15:11.689 --> 15:13.241
I'm just trying to
give you a heads up.

15:13.241 --> 15:14.517
Well I appreciate
it Vanessa.

15:14.517 --> 15:15.275
But he's wrong.

15:15.275 --> 15:17.344
My team is
my priority.

15:24.655 --> 15:25.482
How about
this one here?

15:28.965 --> 15:29.793
No.

15:29.793 --> 15:32.172
I don't know.

15:32.172 --> 15:33.620
Is there any chance that
he's not even in there?

15:33.620 --> 15:34.896
These are
mugshots of cases

15:34.896 --> 15:36.586
that you've been
working on recently.

15:38.517 --> 15:39.206
Hey, worth a shot.

15:39.206 --> 15:39.931
I don't know.

15:39.931 --> 15:40.827
Maybe my head-

15:40.827 --> 15:43.413
is just playing
games with me.

15:43.413 --> 15:44.482
Or maybe he just-

15:44.482 --> 15:45.965
I didn't even recognize
him in the first place.

15:45.965 --> 15:46.724
I don't know.

15:46.724 --> 15:47.482
I just don't-

15:51.034 --> 15:52.241
Some cop I am.

15:53.103 --> 15:56.137
Jesse are you up
for talking about it?

15:59.068 --> 16:00.310
Yeah it's just
a headache.

16:00.310 --> 16:02.000
We can talk
about it.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.620
The shooter may have
had an accomplice Jesse.

16:07.620 --> 16:08.689
It might have
been a woman.

16:08.689 --> 16:10.137
Did you see
anybody else outside?

16:10.137 --> 16:11.206
Anybody at all?

16:21.310 --> 16:22.034
Wait wait wait!

16:24.172 --> 16:24.862
Cheers!

16:24.862 --> 16:26.310
Cheers!

16:32.862 --> 16:33.517
Yeah.

16:33.517 --> 16:35.793
There was a woman-

16:35.793 --> 16:36.482
last night.

16:36.482 --> 16:37.206
She wasn't outside.

16:37.206 --> 16:38.068
She was
at the pub.

16:38.068 --> 16:39.137
Okay.

16:39.827 --> 16:41.379
She was
there last night.

16:41.379 --> 16:42.862
Diana.

16:42.862 --> 16:44.379
Her name is Diana.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.206
She works at the
electronics store

16:46.206 --> 16:47.000
that I go to.

16:47.000 --> 16:47.965
What does
she look like?

16:49.344 --> 16:51.413
Medium height.

16:51.413 --> 16:52.413
Brown hair.

16:52.413 --> 16:54.620
Um- she's smart.

16:54.620 --> 16:56.620
She's too smart
for that store.

16:56.620 --> 16:58.000
Customers talk
down to her.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.172
But she runs circles
around them.

16:59.172 --> 17:01.620
Can you connect her to
the man who shot Jesse?

17:01.620 --> 17:02.862
If she works in an
electronics store-

17:02.862 --> 17:03.689
she would have
the technology

17:03.689 --> 17:04.413
to copy
the key fobs.

17:04.862 --> 17:05.551
There's a connection.

17:07.137 --> 17:08.310
That's where
I know him.

17:08.310 --> 17:10.034
He would hang out around
the electronics store with her.

17:10.034 --> 17:11.103
He was her boyfriend.

17:12.551 --> 17:13.344
SJPD!

17:13.344 --> 17:14.448
Stay away
from the vehicle!

17:19.000 --> 17:20.413
Max Fontana.

17:21.413 --> 17:22.310
His name is
Max Fontana.

17:22.310 --> 17:23.068
Look him up.

17:24.517 --> 17:25.448
Max Fontana.

17:25.448 --> 17:26.275
Yeah.

17:26.275 --> 17:27.344
Yeah, look it up.

17:27.344 --> 17:28.034
Max Fontana.

17:28.034 --> 17:29.172
Max Fontana.

17:31.275 --> 17:32.241
Nice work.

17:32.689 --> 17:33.724
I've got
a Max Fontana.

17:35.000 --> 17:35.827
There's one in here.

17:35.827 --> 17:37.931
He has an address
on Lime Street.

17:37.931 --> 17:38.896
No priors.

17:38.896 --> 17:41.000
But he has a registered
semi-automatic.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.241
Is that him?

17:45.000 --> 17:45.862
That him?

17:46.724 --> 17:47.689
Yeah.

17:49.827 --> 17:51.310
Yeah that's the
guy who shot me.

17:53.758 --> 17:54.551
Rex.

18:07.931 --> 18:09.448
We're pulling up near
Max's apartment right now.

18:09.448 --> 18:10.517
Got to go.

18:51.758 --> 18:53.275
Looks like someone
got to him first pal.

19:02.758 --> 19:03.517
There, is
that okay?

19:03.517 --> 19:04.482
Oh yeah.

19:04.482 --> 19:05.517
Thank you.

19:05.517 --> 19:06.620
So um-

19:08.965 --> 19:11.482
Charlie and Rex
found the shooter.

19:11.482 --> 19:12.862
Yeah?

19:14.655 --> 19:15.827
Did he confess?

19:17.827 --> 19:19.000
No, he's dead Jesse.

19:22.827 --> 19:24.137
No.

19:25.172 --> 19:26.724
Oh I didn't
wish for that.

19:26.724 --> 19:27.413
No I know.

19:27.413 --> 19:28.241
I know.

19:28.241 --> 19:29.689
It must-

19:31.172 --> 19:34.275
It must be
really hard on his friends.

19:37.034 --> 19:38.482
You're still
feeling tired hey?

19:38.482 --> 19:39.241
Uh-

19:41.137 --> 19:43.517
I should
have a nap.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.172
I have a nap.

19:45.172 --> 19:46.827
I take a
more rest.

19:48.344 --> 19:51.000
And get ready
for the trial.

19:52.689 --> 19:54.310
I need to see a
doctor right away.

20:04.448 --> 20:07.517
I know this
is a difficult time.

20:07.517 --> 20:09.551
Thank you for
coming in, Diana.

20:09.551 --> 20:10.793
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.482
I just-

20:12.482 --> 20:14.896
I don't understand why anyone
would want to hurt Max.

20:14.896 --> 20:17.103
He was just-

20:17.103 --> 20:18.793
He was such
a sweetheart.

20:20.793 --> 20:21.862
How long were
you two together?

20:21.862 --> 20:22.827
Not long.

20:22.827 --> 20:23.931
We were more
friends than together.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.068
I know you work at
the electronics store.

20:26.068 --> 20:27.551
What did Max
do for work?

20:29.172 --> 20:30.793
Um- different things.

20:32.448 --> 20:33.620
He was a drummer.

20:34.379 --> 20:35.103
You know.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.551
Doesn't really
pay the bills.

20:36.551 --> 20:38.413
Mm-hmm.

20:38.413 --> 20:40.931
Had he been acting
different recently?

20:42.448 --> 20:43.586
Like in what way?

20:44.827 --> 20:46.586
Keeping a different schedule?

20:46.586 --> 20:47.482
Something like that?

20:47.482 --> 20:48.413
Um-

20:48.413 --> 20:50.793
I guess he was out
nights more often.

20:52.034 --> 20:53.551
Practicing with a
new band, I think.

20:54.448 --> 20:55.517
Hmm.

20:55.517 --> 20:56.758
Any new income?

20:56.758 --> 20:58.586
Not that
I know of.

20:58.586 --> 20:59.793
Why do you ask?

20:59.793 --> 21:01.482
I believe Max stole
a car last night.

21:03.275 --> 21:04.344
Max?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.068
I had no idea.

21:08.827 --> 21:09.931
Is that why
he was killed?

21:09.931 --> 21:10.896
Well car theft

21:10.896 --> 21:13.137
can attract some pretty
serious criminals.

21:13.137 --> 21:15.620
The model of car

21:15.620 --> 21:18.379
that Max targeted last night
is very popular overseas.

21:18.379 --> 21:19.793
It's often-

21:19.793 --> 21:22.965
you know,
terrorist organizations

21:22.965 --> 21:24.793
buying these vehicles.

21:24.793 --> 21:26.931
I don't understand how that
has anything to do with Max

21:26.931 --> 21:28.448
or anyone here
in St. John's.

21:28.448 --> 21:29.655
If somebody were to

21:29.655 --> 21:33.068
get into business with one
of these organizations-

21:33.068 --> 21:34.931
they might find themselves
in a lot of pressure

21:34.931 --> 21:35.827
to meet quotas.

21:35.827 --> 21:37.103
No.

21:37.103 --> 21:39.103
Max would never get involved
in something like that.

21:39.586 --> 21:41.172
Max shot a
police officer

21:41.172 --> 21:42.827
during the course of
the theft last night.

21:42.827 --> 21:43.862
What?

21:43.862 --> 21:45.655
Was Max the trigger-happy
type, do you think?

21:47.034 --> 21:48.448
I have never known
him to be violent.

21:48.448 --> 21:49.827
Or do you think his
employers told him

21:49.827 --> 21:51.379
to steal cars
at any cost?

21:52.310 --> 21:54.931
Look this is all a
complete surprise to me.

21:54.931 --> 21:55.896
Okay?

21:56.655 --> 21:58.172
Do you know where he
was taking the cars?

21:58.172 --> 21:59.172
No!

21:59.172 --> 22:00.344
Do you know who
he was working with?

22:01.137 --> 22:02.931
I wish I
could help

22:02.931 --> 22:03.655
and give you answers.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.275
But I don't know.

22:06.620 --> 22:07.344
I'm sorry.

22:07.344 --> 22:08.103
Of course.

22:08.103 --> 22:09.000
Thank you
for coming in.

22:18.931 --> 22:20.034
I'll show you
to the door.

22:20.034 --> 22:21.517
Again, I'm very
sorry for your loss.

22:21.517 --> 22:23.310
Yeah, thanks.

22:25.068 --> 22:26.655
What do you think?

22:26.655 --> 22:27.758
She tried very hard

22:27.758 --> 22:29.793
to convince me she had no
idea what Max was up to.

22:29.793 --> 22:31.310
But she's
in on this.

22:31.310 --> 22:32.482
As soon as
I mentioned

22:32.482 --> 22:34.827
that terrorist groups
sometimes buy these vehicles-

22:34.827 --> 22:36.689
she knew exactly what
I was talking about.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.827
Yeah but there's nothing
in Max's phone records

22:38.827 --> 22:41.896
to indicate that he called her
the night of Jesse's shooting.

22:41.896 --> 22:43.206
Did he use a
burner phone?

22:44.862 --> 22:46.344
She works in an
electronics shop.

22:46.344 --> 22:49.103
The key fob technology
would be no problem for her.

22:49.103 --> 22:51.206
Yeah but that's not enough
for a warrant Charlie.

22:51.206 --> 22:52.241
We've got
nothing on her.

22:52.241 --> 22:53.586
We've got to catch
her in the act.

22:53.586 --> 22:54.758
Yeah.

22:54.758 --> 22:56.827
Chief Superintendent,
this was dropped off for you.

22:56.827 --> 22:57.551
Thank you.

22:57.551 --> 22:58.517
You're welcome.

23:00.068 --> 23:01.724
I guess I'm not going
to be needing this.

23:02.793 --> 23:03.793
You're not going
to the gala?

23:03.793 --> 23:05.379
With Jesse in
the hospital?

23:05.379 --> 23:06.103
Come on Charlie.

23:09.344 --> 23:10.137
I've got an idea.

23:13.034 --> 23:14.275
His vitals are good.

23:14.275 --> 23:15.551
Just now, he
seemed lethargic.

23:15.551 --> 23:17.103
And he was
slurring his speech.

23:17.103 --> 23:18.275
Any dizziness?

23:19.137 --> 23:20.896
No no, not that
he mentioned.

23:20.896 --> 23:23.827
You know, that could be a
reaction to the anesthetic.

23:24.620 --> 23:25.724
I don't want
to be alarmed.

23:25.724 --> 23:28.724
But I am going to
take him for a CT scan-

23:28.724 --> 23:30.034
just to be on
the safe side.

23:33.241 --> 23:34.172
He's seizing!

23:34.862 --> 23:35.793
Dr. Kelly: Nurse!

23:37.000 --> 23:38.724
Push diazepam
and call the OR!

23:38.724 --> 23:40.068
Page the
neurosurgeon on call!

23:40.068 --> 23:40.965
Is it a
brain bleed?

23:40.965 --> 23:42.413
I'm sorry, Dr. Truong.

23:42.413 --> 23:43.758
We need you
to step out.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.000
Try and get
him stabilized!

23:45.965 --> 23:46.862
Diazepam!

23:47.310 --> 23:48.862
He's not responding!

23:48.862 --> 23:49.896
Call the OR!

23:49.896 --> 23:50.689
Pressure dropping.

23:50.689 --> 23:51.551
Flush his IV.

23:51.551 --> 23:52.448
Nurse2: Hold him down!

24:02.413 --> 24:04.103
Of course we were
focused on the gunshots.

24:04.103 --> 24:06.034
And a brain bleed wouldn't
have shown up on his vitals.

24:06.034 --> 24:08.000
So they'll
operate again?

24:08.931 --> 24:09.724
Yeah.

24:09.724 --> 24:10.965
But there's a risk
of brain damage.

24:15.206 --> 24:17.000
I should have seen
the signs earlier.

24:19.103 --> 24:19.896
Hey.

24:21.137 --> 24:21.965
Hey.

24:23.758 --> 24:24.827
Hey.

24:26.620 --> 24:27.827
You did.

24:27.827 --> 24:30.000
That's why the doctors had
a chance to react so fast.

24:45.793 --> 24:48.724
Getting these guys isn't going
to make Jesse any better.

24:49.862 --> 24:51.206
I know.

24:52.724 --> 24:55.137
But a thousand
dollars a plate

24:55.137 --> 24:57.620
means a lot of luxury
vehicles in that parking lot.

25:00.862 --> 25:03.517
They might have a
delivery schedule to keep.

25:03.517 --> 25:04.482
Go.

25:06.413 --> 25:07.275
You have to go.

25:08.241 --> 25:10.517
You can't do
anything here.

25:22.310 --> 25:23.068
Rex.

26:36.448 --> 26:37.862
Bait car is
in place.

26:37.862 --> 26:40.655
We have uniformed
officers on stand-by.

26:40.655 --> 26:42.379
And our valet is keeping
an eye on the garage.

26:42.379 --> 26:43.517
Busy tonight.

26:43.517 --> 26:45.758
I just hope we find out how
many drivers they have.

26:48.724 --> 26:49.793
Joe.

26:49.793 --> 26:51.068
Glad to see
you made it.

26:51.068 --> 26:52.034
Of course, Commissioner.

26:52.034 --> 26:53.655
Wouldn't miss this
for the world.

27:07.344 --> 27:08.517
How's your man?

27:09.862 --> 27:10.758
He's on the mend.

27:10.758 --> 27:11.586
Good.

27:11.896 --> 27:13.241
There's someone I
want you to meet.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.241
Dr. Kelly: Just be sure
to check on him

27:39.241 --> 27:40.344
every half hour okay?

27:41.620 --> 27:42.517
Dr. Truong.

27:43.344 --> 27:44.275
You can come in.

27:55.620 --> 27:56.620
We've done
what we can.

27:58.034 --> 28:00.206
All that's left now
is to wait and see.

28:06.172 --> 28:08.275
Do you think he'll have
permanent damage?

28:11.551 --> 28:13.034
We'll know more
when he wakes up.

28:17.344 --> 28:18.448
Of course.

29:50.103 --> 29:51.000
Out of the vehicle!

29:55.034 --> 29:55.827
Hands on the hood.

29:57.344 --> 29:58.586
What's this about, Detective?

29:58.586 --> 29:59.793
The theft
of a vehicle.

29:59.793 --> 30:01.620
You okay
in there Rex?

30:01.620 --> 30:02.931
Well this
is my car.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.689
So you must
be mistaken.

30:04.689 --> 30:05.413
Right.

30:05.413 --> 30:06.517
Get the registration.

30:08.206 --> 30:09.068
Come on pal.

30:14.068 --> 30:15.172
What did you
do with Rex?

30:16.689 --> 30:17.655
Hmm?

30:17.655 --> 30:19.931
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

30:19.931 --> 30:21.413
Enough of these
games okay?

30:21.413 --> 30:22.413
This is
the car that-

30:22.413 --> 30:23.896
Appears
in order, Detective.

30:34.344 --> 30:36.310
Get them to check the
garage for the bait car.

30:36.310 --> 30:37.344
Now.

30:39.344 --> 30:40.724
You had a bait
car at the gala?

30:40.724 --> 30:42.344
Mm-hmm.

30:42.344 --> 30:43.482
The same make
as my car?

30:43.482 --> 30:45.103
Well-

30:45.103 --> 30:45.862
That's unfortunate.

30:45.862 --> 30:47.000
Who are your drivers?

30:47.862 --> 30:49.275
Where are the
cars going?

30:50.137 --> 30:53.965
You know, you're so convinced
I'm involved in this.

30:53.965 --> 30:56.000
I almost want to
give you answers.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.379
Detective.

30:57.379 --> 30:59.413
The bait car
was taken.

31:03.724 --> 31:04.827
Rex was
in that car.

31:11.172 --> 31:12.034
Joe.

31:13.206 --> 31:14.206
We've got a problem.

31:17.275 --> 31:19.034
Do your people have
it under control or not?

31:19.034 --> 31:20.655
That is what I'm
trying to find out!

31:20.655 --> 31:22.379
There's got to be a back
exit around here somewhere.

31:22.379 --> 31:23.655
Leave it to them.

31:23.655 --> 31:25.724
We are short-handed
enough as it is!

31:25.724 --> 31:27.034
If you leave, Joe-

31:27.034 --> 31:29.862
you'll be the shortest-lived
chief in SJPD history.

31:29.862 --> 31:31.586
That is a record
I'm willing to set.

31:39.551 --> 31:40.482
Shoot!

31:41.137 --> 31:41.827
Rex!

31:44.896 --> 31:45.827
Rex!

31:49.724 --> 31:50.413
Charlie!

31:50.413 --> 31:52.034
What about the tracker?

31:56.896 --> 31:57.620
The signal's gone Joe.

32:00.689 --> 32:01.862
They've got Rex.

32:02.896 --> 32:03.793
Our team

32:03.793 --> 32:05.103
was supposed to
follow the bait car!

32:05.103 --> 32:07.137
They made it as far as
the last location of the GPS.

32:07.137 --> 32:08.310
But the car
was gone.

32:08.310 --> 32:09.137
And Rex with it.

32:11.034 --> 32:11.965
Wait a second.

32:13.206 --> 32:14.379
I've got an idea

32:14.379 --> 32:16.137
how we can find out
where the car is going.

32:16.965 --> 32:17.655
Got to go.

32:53.206 --> 32:55.103
So your dog was in
this stolen vehicle?

32:57.310 --> 32:59.793
I saw you copy those
fobs at the valet station.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.103
Who'd you give
the stolen keys to?

33:05.034 --> 33:06.172
Look.

33:07.034 --> 33:09.482
I consented to a search
of my person and my vehicle.

33:09.482 --> 33:11.965
You haven't got a scanner
or any copied fobs, so-

33:11.965 --> 33:13.965
you must be mistaken
about what you saw.

33:13.965 --> 33:15.586
We both know
I'm not mistaken.

33:16.448 --> 33:17.689
Well without any evidence-

33:17.689 --> 33:19.724
you have no reason
to detain me.

33:25.551 --> 33:27.896
Sorry I can't
help you, Detective.

35:03.689 --> 35:04.551
Sarah.

35:12.793 --> 35:15.758
How are
you feeling?

35:15.758 --> 35:16.724
Oh-

35:18.310 --> 35:19.172
What happened?

35:19.172 --> 35:21.620
You had a
subdural hematoma.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.931
Oh!

35:23.931 --> 35:24.827
What is that?

35:26.862 --> 35:28.379
You had a lot of
pressure on your brain.

35:28.379 --> 35:29.689
They were able
to relieve it.

35:29.689 --> 35:30.931
Well my
headache is gone.

35:30.931 --> 35:32.241
So that's a good
sign, right?

35:32.241 --> 35:33.655
Yes, it is a
good sign.

35:33.655 --> 35:34.689
Good sign!
- Yup!

35:34.689 --> 35:36.620
Very good sign.

35:36.620 --> 35:37.344
Hey.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.206
Uh- how's Charlie doing?

35:39.206 --> 35:39.931
He thinks
the woman

35:39.931 --> 35:41.206
from the
electronics store

35:41.206 --> 35:41.862
was Max's accomplice.

35:41.862 --> 35:42.827
You were right.

35:42.827 --> 35:44.275
He and Joe are out
looking for her.

35:44.275 --> 35:45.172
And Rex?

35:46.965 --> 35:48.275
He's with them.

36:04.896 --> 36:05.827
That's good.

36:06.758 --> 36:07.965
Listen to me.

36:07.965 --> 36:10.000
Nothing leaves that harbour
without us knowing about it.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.137
I want to know every ship
that goes in and goes out.

36:12.137 --> 36:13.482
Priority one!

36:13.482 --> 36:14.793
Thank you.

36:17.689 --> 36:19.103
Did the GPS on
her car not move?

36:19.103 --> 36:21.379
No, but she could have
found it and taken it out.

36:22.137 --> 36:22.827
Okay.

36:22.827 --> 36:23.689
Well-

36:23.689 --> 36:24.931
Hold on.

36:24.931 --> 36:26.172
We've got two ships
leaving the harbour

36:26.172 --> 36:27.172
first thing in
the morning.

36:27.172 --> 36:28.551
One's going to Antigua.

36:28.551 --> 36:30.034
The other one's
going to Ghana.

36:31.068 --> 36:32.310
Rex could be
shipped to Ghana?

36:32.310 --> 36:33.000
Don't worry Charlie.

36:33.000 --> 36:33.896
We're going
to find him.

36:33.896 --> 36:35.448
Let's check the harbour.

36:36.931 --> 36:37.655
Sun's almost up.

36:54.448 --> 36:55.413
Stop loading!

36:56.655 --> 36:58.310
We can't stop
loading buddy!

36:58.310 --> 36:59.310
Chief Superintendent
Joe Donovan.

36:59.310 --> 37:00.551
SJPD.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.862
One of our officers
is out here.

37:02.862 --> 37:05.724
And this boat is not going
anywhere until we find him.

37:06.620 --> 37:07.586
Hold the load.

37:08.758 --> 37:09.413
You've got five minutes-

37:09.413 --> 37:10.344
and I'm calling
my boss.

37:11.517 --> 37:12.448
Yeah, you do that.

37:13.896 --> 37:15.103
Rex!

37:17.379 --> 37:18.206
Rex!

37:25.517 --> 37:26.448
Rex!

37:34.620 --> 37:36.103
You've got to
be kidding me.

37:39.068 --> 37:39.896
Rex!

37:42.137 --> 37:42.862
Rex!

37:48.448 --> 37:49.655
Charlie [distant]: Rex!

37:58.103 --> 37:58.827
Rex!

38:19.448 --> 38:20.586
Hey Charlie!

38:20.586 --> 38:21.344
Joe.

38:21.344 --> 38:22.448
Listen, I checked
around back.

38:22.448 --> 38:24.000
He's not there.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.896
I'm going to keep
looking for him elsewhere.

38:26.965 --> 38:28.586
Maybe you'll
lead us to Rex.

38:28.586 --> 38:30.241
The GPS tracker on
Diana's car is moving.

38:31.206 --> 38:32.344
Looks like it's
heading this way.

38:32.344 --> 38:33.379
Okay I'll catch
up with you.

38:33.379 --> 38:34.310
Yeah.

39:24.172 --> 39:25.172
There he is.

39:42.586 --> 39:43.482
Boss!

39:43.482 --> 39:44.551
Until you called,
we had no idea

39:44.551 --> 39:45.827
there was a dog
in the truck!

39:45.827 --> 39:47.275
We've got to
shut that dog up!

39:47.275 --> 39:48.379
Open it.

40:37.413 --> 40:38.137
I wouldn't do that.

40:39.655 --> 40:41.068
Easy now.

40:46.758 --> 40:47.586
I've got this Charlie.

40:47.586 --> 40:49.000
Thanks Joe.

40:50.206 --> 40:51.034
Come on.

40:51.034 --> 40:51.724
Let's go.

40:52.896 --> 40:54.103
Turn around.

40:54.103 --> 40:55.758
You need not
say anything.

40:59.137 --> 41:00.896
Okay so you broke
the car-jacking ring.

41:00.896 --> 41:03.034
But who killed Max?

41:03.034 --> 41:04.241
Hey!

41:04.241 --> 41:05.103
That was Diana.

41:05.103 --> 41:06.275
Her gun matched
the ballistics.

41:06.275 --> 41:07.620
And her fingerprints
matched the partial

41:07.620 --> 41:09.137
in the cartridges
on your case.

41:09.137 --> 41:10.172
So we think

41:10.172 --> 41:11.655
we can make accessory
charges stick there, too.

41:11.655 --> 41:12.827
Wow.

41:12.827 --> 41:15.310
That's a pretty
exciting first few days

41:15.310 --> 41:16.034
as interim chief!

41:16.034 --> 41:17.000
Huh boss?

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Yeah.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.241
Uh, about that-

41:20.034 --> 41:20.689
What?

41:20.689 --> 41:21.793
I may have
used my title

41:21.793 --> 41:23.310
to shut down the
docks for a few hours.

41:23.310 --> 41:25.344
And well-

41:25.344 --> 41:27.172
it didn't sit well with
the Port Authority CEO.

41:28.724 --> 41:30.827
So to make a
long story short-

41:31.413 --> 41:32.551
I've been fired.

41:33.103 --> 41:33.758
You got fired?

41:33.758 --> 41:34.482
You're kidding me!

41:34.482 --> 41:35.689
Yeah that's okay though!

41:35.689 --> 41:38.793
Turns out Superintendent
Lewis got the job after all.

41:39.586 --> 41:40.586
I think
you would

41:40.586 --> 41:42.620
have made a great Chief
Superintendent, Joe.

41:44.344 --> 41:45.482
Well thank you.

41:45.482 --> 41:46.482
But you know what?

41:46.482 --> 41:47.896
Major Crimes is always
going to be my home.

41:49.965 --> 41:51.586
Hey Jesse.

41:51.586 --> 41:52.517
Did your brush
with death

41:52.517 --> 41:53.827
give you any insight
into your life?

41:53.827 --> 41:55.344
You can relate huh?

41:56.655 --> 41:57.793
Yeah yeah,
I just don't want

41:57.793 --> 41:59.241
to waste the time
that I have left.

41:59.517 --> 42:00.931
So-

42:00.931 --> 42:02.827
with your support, I-

42:04.448 --> 42:06.827
I want to go for my
qualifications exam.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.310
To be a detective?

42:09.310 --> 42:10.586
Yeah.

42:10.586 --> 42:12.275
I'll write you
a reference letter.

42:14.034 --> 42:15.000
Thanks.

42:15.000 --> 42:15.965
What do you
think Joe?

42:15.965 --> 42:17.413
Do you think there's
room in Major Crimes

42:17.413 --> 42:19.758
for a Detective Mills?

42:19.758 --> 42:21.172
Well how about
you pass first.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.034
And then we'll talk.

42:22.724 --> 42:24.034
Okay.

42:24.034 --> 42:25.620
Then who knows, maybe
I'll get a dog, too!

42:25.620 --> 42:26.517
What do you
think Rex?

42:28.965 --> 42:29.689
I didn't mean it!

42:32.310 --> 42:33.241
I'm sorry.

42:33.241 --> 42:34.758
I'm sorry, it was
only ever you.

42:34.758 --> 42:35.482
Yeah.
