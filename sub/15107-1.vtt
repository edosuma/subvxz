00:09.535 --> 00:13.956
<i>What I'd like to do today is</i>
<i>get your version of what happened.</i>

00:14.624 --> 00:17.542
- You mean the truth?
- Of course.

00:18.085 --> 00:21.756
First, just state your name and
your occupation for the record.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.842
Egg Shen, bus driver.

00:25.551 --> 00:29.598
Bus driver.
What kind of bus and where, please?

00:30.807 --> 00:36.521
Tour bus. Bus for tourists.
San Francisco Chinatown.

00:36.605 --> 00:42.653
Thank you.
Now, before we get to the meat of this thing,

00:42.736 --> 00:46.073
do you at the present time
have any knowledge

00:46.156 --> 00:48.909
of the whereabouts of
a Mr Jack Burton or his truck?

00:48.992 --> 00:52.704
- Oh, God. Will you leave him alone?
- Mr Shen, please.

00:52.788 --> 00:59.086
You could be in a great deal of trouble. Half
a city block explodes in a ball of green flame.

00:59.169 --> 01:02.214
Green flame! All hell is breaking loose here.

01:02.297 --> 01:04.884
And there are people
who say you're involved,

01:04.968 --> 01:10.014
that you might be responsible,
that you're a very dangerous man.

01:10.098 --> 01:14.894
- Now, if you're protecting Jack Burton...
- You leave Jack Burton alone!

01:16.020 --> 01:20.066
We are in his debt. He showed great courage.

01:25.405 --> 01:28.199
OK.

01:28.283 --> 01:32.036
But if I'm gonna be your attorney,
there are a few things I have to know

01:32.120 --> 01:34.581
that still don't make any sense to me.

01:34.664 --> 01:36.749
Like...

01:37.500 --> 01:39.794
do you really believe in magic?

01:41.004 --> 01:43.549
You mean Chinese black magic?

01:43.632 --> 01:46.635
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

01:46.719 --> 01:52.266
Are you still serious about this? And
monsters and ghosts as well, I suppose?

01:52.349 --> 01:55.519
Sure. And sorcery.

01:56.687 --> 02:02.151
And I suppose that you expect me
to believe in sorcery as well?

02:02.234 --> 02:04.653
- Of course.
- Why?

02:04.737 --> 02:07.072
Because it's real.

02:07.156 --> 02:09.241
How can I know that, Mr Shen?

02:09.324 --> 02:13.412
- How?
- Yes, how? Help me out here.

02:14.121 --> 02:15.706
Please.

02:22.297 --> 02:25.008
See? That was nothing.

02:26.259 --> 02:29.304
But that's how it always begins.

02:29.387 --> 02:31.765
Very small.

<i>This is Jack Burton at the Pork-Chop Express</i>
<i>and I'm talkin' to whoever's listenin'.</i>

03:00.544 --> 03:02.713
It's like I told my last wife.

03:02.797 --> 03:05.841
I says "Honey,
I never drive faster than I can see."

03:05.925 --> 03:09.887
"Besides that, it's all in the reflexes."

03:15.559 --> 03:21.023
You just listen to the Pork-Chop Express and
take his advice on a dark and stormy night.

03:21.107 --> 03:24.026
When some wild-eyed maniac
grabs your neck,

03:24.110 --> 03:27.029
taps the back of your head
up against a barroom wall,

03:27.113 --> 03:31.118
he looks you crooked in the eye
and asks you if you've paid your dues,

03:31.201 --> 03:37.165
you just stare that big sucker back in the eye
and remember what Jack Burton always says.

03:37.249 --> 03:42.254
"Have you paid your dues, Jack?"
"Yes, sir, the cheque is in the mail."

03:58.770 --> 04:04.735
Well, you see, I'm not sayin' that I've been
everywhere and I've done everything.

04:04.818 --> 04:08.823
But I do know it's a pretty
amazing planet we live on here,

04:08.907 --> 04:14.287
and a man would have to be some kinda fool
to think we're all alone in this universe.

05:34.744 --> 05:37.455
I can't believe you're stuck on even.
This is odd!

05:37.539 --> 05:40.333
All right, even! Another even! Come on!

05:40.417 --> 05:43.378
You want one more? All right!

05:48.216 --> 05:51.094
- What do we got? He can't count.
- Even!

05:51.177 --> 05:55.056
Learn how to play some fan-tan here,
buddy-boy!

05:55.140 --> 05:57.434
Three!

06:17.371 --> 06:20.416
Heaven and earth, boys. What can I tell ya?

06:23.169 --> 06:27.465
You like that one?
What did he say, Wang? In English?

06:27.548 --> 06:31.302
Something about beginner's luck.
It doesn't translate. But he quits.

06:31.385 --> 06:37.434
He quits? What is this? It's a brand-new day
and he's still got 100 bucks in his pocket.

06:37.517 --> 06:42.397
I'm not gonna complain, because I'll bet
I'd have lost my shirt in the next 20 minutes.

06:42.481 --> 06:45.567
Breaks my heart to do this,
but the next time I'm down here,

06:45.651 --> 06:49.696
you'll gang up on Jack so fast
he won't know what the hell happened.

06:49.780 --> 06:52.240
- No.
- Ah, sure. Easy come, easy go, Wang.

06:52.324 --> 06:53.492
No!

06:55.369 --> 06:58.288
Not next time. Now.

07:00.499 --> 07:03.669
Is this gonna get ugly now? I hope not.

07:03.752 --> 07:06.964
I thought what we were here,
racial differences aside,

07:07.047 --> 07:10.676
was a coupla old friends,
both of us Californians.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.346
Shit, Wang. It's only a game.

07:16.891 --> 07:18.851
Nothin' or double.

07:18.935 --> 07:22.021
This knife cuts this bottle in half.

07:24.023 --> 07:25.316
- Nothin' or double.
- Bullshit.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.986
- Nothin' or double.
- Why, man? Don't be stupid.

07:28.069 --> 07:31.155
- I need the money.
- I got near a thousand bucks here, Wang.

07:31.239 --> 07:33.449
1,148, Jack.

07:39.539 --> 07:42.375
OK. But not that bottle.

07:45.169 --> 07:46.629
This bottle.

07:51.510 --> 07:53.220
OK.

07:53.304 --> 07:56.181
You're outta your mind, Wang. God bless ya!

08:07.985 --> 08:11.280
- It's all in the reflexes.
- It always works at home.

08:11.363 --> 08:17.119
Have me over for dinner some year and prove
it. In the meantime, pay up: $1,148 times two.

08:17.202 --> 08:20.080
- I don't have that kind of money.
- I didn't hear that.

08:20.164 --> 08:25.462
- I'm just a poor Chinese boy, you know?
- You own a restaurant. That's more than me.

08:25.545 --> 08:30.425
Yeah, right. What I meant was,
I don't got that kind of money on me.

08:30.508 --> 08:33.470
That's what I thought you meant.
Where's your truck?

08:33.678 --> 08:35.889
- I gotta go somewhere.
- No, you don't.

08:35.972 --> 08:39.392
I do. How about we meet in my restaurant
in a few hours? I pay then.

08:39.476 --> 08:42.062
- You pay now. Where you gotta go?
- The airport.

08:42.145 --> 08:45.482
- Yeah, right. Over my dead body.
- If need be.

08:46.983 --> 08:50.695
- I'll follow you.
- You don't trust me? That makes me sad.

08:50.779 --> 08:54.783
- It reminds me of an old Chinese joke.
- Save it. I'll give you a lift. Get in.

08:54.866 --> 08:59.287
- You were gonna follow me, Jack.
- I know, then I came to my senses.

08:59.913 --> 09:03.042
- So who are we pickin' up?
- A girl. I don't wanna talk about it.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.419
- A girl? Where from?
- Peking.

09:06.254 --> 09:10.216
This is a big day in my life. I should
have gone home and gotten 40 winks.

09:10.299 --> 09:13.094
A girl from China? All right, I never done that.

09:13.177 --> 09:17.974
I picked up girls from everywhere else,
but never from China. Is she pretty?

09:19.392 --> 09:22.728
- I'm gonna marry her, Jack.
- Oh, God!

09:22.812 --> 09:27.066
I've known her since we were kids.
I haven't seen her in five years.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.902
I came here alone.
I worked my fingers till they bled.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.071
Before you knew me, I slept on the floor.

09:32.154 --> 09:35.491
I saved every nickel to bring her here
because I love her so much.

09:35.574 --> 09:41.707
I can't eat, sleep or think properly without her
any more. She'll put my whole life in order.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.501
Boy, listen to me. Real tough guy.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.713
You sound a little nervous, pal.

09:48.088 --> 09:53.719
That's why the bottle didn't slice. My mind
and my spirit are goin' north and south.

10:01.852 --> 10:06.523
<i>Flight number 26 has just arrived</i>
<i>at gate number seven.</i>

10:11.403 --> 10:14.115
Whoa. Who is that?

10:15.408 --> 10:18.244
She has green eyes.
You know how rare that is, Jack?

10:18.328 --> 10:23.124
- How can you tell from here?
- Not her. She's trouble. Miao Yin.

10:23.958 --> 10:26.920
Beautiful green eyes, like creamy jade.

10:27.420 --> 10:28.796
Trouble, huh?

10:41.726 --> 10:44.854
- Can I ask you a serious question?
- Absolutely not.

10:44.938 --> 10:49.359
- Would you consider jumping right into...
- Sure, but not with a man in your condition.

10:49.442 --> 10:54.031
- What's wrong with my condition?
- Try standing downwind where I am.

10:54.114 --> 10:57.534
- It's Miller time.
- You know what I say when it's Miller time?

10:59.578 --> 11:02.039
Wait a minute!

11:02.539 --> 11:04.500
- Don't!
- Don't what?

11:04.583 --> 11:10.214
The Lords of Death. Street gang. Punks
from Chinatown. What are they doing here?

11:44.291 --> 11:46.001
Tara!

11:49.546 --> 11:51.881
Miao Yin!

12:02.225 --> 12:03.310
Excuse me.

12:10.401 --> 12:13.237
Let's you and me have a little talk, friend.

12:13.321 --> 12:15.031
What?

12:15.114 --> 12:17.158
Where'd you get that?

12:25.124 --> 12:26.876
Wait a minute, pal.

12:28.961 --> 12:30.046
Get that one!

12:38.012 --> 12:40.349
Come on, Jack!

12:56.990 --> 12:58.700
Where?

12:59.952 --> 13:02.120
Call the cops!

13:24.143 --> 13:26.479
Son of a bitch must pay!

13:30.525 --> 13:33.361
What's goin' on, Wang?
Why'd they steal your girl?

13:33.444 --> 13:37.907
You tell me! How come it's not safe to walk
in Central Park or to give a stranger a lift?

13:37.991 --> 13:43.538
- Because the world's full of crazy people.
- The American girl knew something was up.

13:43.621 --> 13:45.873
Stay away from her. She's a lawyer.

13:45.957 --> 13:48.918
She's a what? Oh, come on!

13:49.669 --> 13:53.214
- What the hell...?
- They got a clubhouse where they hang out.

13:53.298 --> 13:55.509
- To sharpen their knives?
- I can't ask you to...

13:55.593 --> 13:57.636
- Where is it?
- Thank you, Jack.

14:03.267 --> 14:08.606
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I am Mr Egg Shen, with this wonderful tour.

14:08.689 --> 14:11.358
Sit back and enjoy yourselves, see?

14:11.442 --> 14:17.156
Long time ago, Chinese men with
gold-rush fever flooded into California.

14:17.239 --> 14:20.743
We call <i>Gum Shan</i> - Mountain of Gold, see?

14:20.826 --> 14:24.038
Leaving behind their wives and children.

14:24.538 --> 14:28.709
Working for years to complete
the transcontinental railroad,

14:28.792 --> 14:33.131
saving all their pennies.
And then they sent for their families

14:33.214 --> 14:37.260
to help build this beautiful Chinatown
you see outside your window

14:37.344 --> 14:40.388
this fine warm day.

15:10.544 --> 15:13.547
- Go right, down that alley. Lords of Death!
- What alley?

15:13.631 --> 15:15.508
Go right! Now!

15:36.737 --> 15:39.657
- Where the hell are we?
- Come on, Jack.

15:42.285 --> 15:45.914
Excuse me, ma'am.
I don't suppose you saw a...

15:50.168 --> 15:51.962
No.

15:52.045 --> 15:54.256
Keep moving.

16:21.618 --> 16:23.786
- What is it? A parade?
- A funeral.

16:23.870 --> 16:27.540
- A fighting tong. They're Chang Sings.
- A fighting tong?

16:27.624 --> 16:31.586
Don't panic, Jack.
They're OK. They're good guys.

16:32.420 --> 16:36.382
Maybe we should try a different alley.
What do you say?

16:42.263 --> 16:46.100
Wang, these guys, these Sing Dings.
They got enemies?

16:46.184 --> 16:48.728
- Wing Kong.
- Who wear red turbans?

16:48.811 --> 16:50.772
Holy shit!

16:50.855 --> 16:53.149
These guys are animals, Jack.

18:25.369 --> 18:27.872
- What's happening, Wang?
- Chinese standoff.

18:27.955 --> 18:29.874
A what?

18:29.957 --> 18:32.168
Don't make a sound.

20:40.884 --> 20:42.510
Who's that?

21:52.291 --> 21:55.210
No questions! Just get outta here, Jack!

22:12.728 --> 22:14.730
Jack!

22:19.568 --> 22:22.070
- I think it was Lo Pan.
- Who?

22:39.505 --> 22:41.758
- Don't look, Jack!
- I already did.

22:41.841 --> 22:43.926
- Who? I mean, what?
- Lo Pan. Come on!

22:44.010 --> 22:47.972
- I can't see!
- It's OK. It's only temporary. Over here.

22:49.390 --> 22:51.476
Bend over.

22:52.477 --> 22:54.979
Yeah, yeah.

22:55.063 --> 22:58.650
I ran straight through him, Wang.
How the hell did I do that?

22:58.733 --> 23:01.319
- You didn't. It only appeared that way.
- Right!

23:01.402 --> 23:06.408
- Lords of Death, Jack.
- OK, I'm goin' home. Keep your money.

23:06.492 --> 23:08.661
- Hey, Wang Chi!
- Lookin' for us?

23:08.744 --> 23:12.081
- They know your name.
- That's not good. Let's go!

23:15.084 --> 23:17.169
- My truck!
- Forget it!

23:38.065 --> 23:42.654
Lords of Death controlled by the Wing Kong,
Jack. Just errand boys for the Wing Kong.

23:42.737 --> 23:47.242
Great! Who wiped out all those
yellow turbans? Those guys were winning.

23:52.998 --> 23:55.417
He says it was the Storms. The Three Storms.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.877
Three guys did all that? Listen.

23:57.961 --> 24:01.881
What about that...
whatever it was I ran straight through?

24:01.965 --> 24:03.216
Fast!

24:14.936 --> 24:17.398
Lucky us. We made it.

24:17.481 --> 24:21.360
- All right, where's my truck? I'm outta here.
- Isn't your truck insured?

24:21.444 --> 24:23.988
- Of course it is.
- Then smart man gets it later.

24:24.071 --> 24:27.617
- Smart man calls the cops.
- Cops got better things to do than get killed.

24:27.700 --> 24:28.701
So do I!

24:32.288 --> 24:35.958
Mutual Fidelity Insurers of Sacramento.

24:36.042 --> 24:40.296
Well, there's gotta be a listing, honey.
I pay 'em six G's a year in premiums.

24:40.379 --> 24:46.427
China is here, Mr Burton.
The Chang Sing, the Wing Kong.

24:47.094 --> 24:51.140
- They've been fighting for centuries.
- What does that mean? "China is here"?

24:51.223 --> 24:56.188
I don't know what that means. All I know is,
this Lo Pan character comes out of thin air

24:56.271 --> 25:01.735
in the middle of an alley, while his buddies
fly around, cuttin' everybody to shreds,

25:01.818 --> 25:05.906
and he stands there, waiting for me
to drive my truck straight through him,

25:05.989 --> 25:09.576
- with light comin' out of his mouth!
- Jack, please.

25:11.995 --> 25:14.539
- When did this happen?
- It didn't, not like he says.

25:14.623 --> 25:20.504
Yeah, it did. Two hours ago. Tall guy, weird
clothes. First you see him, then you don't.

25:20.587 --> 25:23.173
Lo Pan appeared on the street?

25:24.132 --> 25:27.386
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want to alarm you, Uncle.

25:27.469 --> 25:31.891
I'm gonna tell you about an accident
and I don't wanna hear "act of God", OK?

25:31.975 --> 25:35.520
All right, look. What's your name?
Mine's Jack Burton.

25:35.603 --> 25:39.107
- Good afternoon, Mr Wong.
- Eddie Lee, meet my friend, Jack Burton.

25:39.190 --> 25:42.610
- Eddie's the new maître d' here.
- And a whole lot more.

25:42.694 --> 25:46.281
Well, I don't know my policy number.
It's in the glove compartment.

25:46.364 --> 25:49.200
Just look under B-U-R-T-O-N, will ya?

25:49.284 --> 25:51.911
- Jack Burton?
- Yeah.

25:52.287 --> 25:55.665
Boy. The guy you always told me about.

25:56.624 --> 26:00.378
- Then that was your abandoned truck.
- Abandoned, like hell!

26:00.461 --> 26:02.672
Hello. Hello?

26:02.755 --> 26:04.340
Oh, Christ!

26:04.424 --> 26:07.511
Bad news. The Lords of Death
stole it after you ran away.

26:07.594 --> 26:11.307
- They stole my truck?
- Take it easy, Jack. You're with friends.

26:11.390 --> 26:13.767
- We'll find it for you.
- Damn right you will.

26:13.851 --> 26:18.731
And my money. And time is money to a guy
like me. And your phone is dead, by the way.

26:18.814 --> 26:24.278
- How do you think I feel? I lost a whole girl!
- The Lords of Death were only on ajoyride.

26:24.361 --> 26:26.530
Not acting on orders from the Wing Kong.

26:26.614 --> 26:30.242
They just wanted a girl to sell
and Miao Yin got in the way.

26:30.326 --> 26:32.828
Plus, the skirmish you guys stumbled into.

26:32.911 --> 26:37.416
Lo Pan, the word is, ordered the boss of
the Chang Sings, Mr Lem Lee, assassinated.

26:37.499 --> 26:39.877
- That was his funeral.
- It was a war, Eddie.

26:39.960 --> 26:44.466
- What are you doing here?
- Don't panic. It's only me, Gracie Law.

26:44.549 --> 26:45.717
Great.

26:45.800 --> 26:49.054
Just passing the neighbourhood
on a dark and stormy night?

26:49.137 --> 26:52.182
- This is my neighbourhood.
- Sure it was a war.

26:52.265 --> 26:56.603
And anybody that showed up was gonnajoin
Lem Lee in the hell of being cut to pieces.

26:56.686 --> 26:59.397
- Hell of being what?
- The Chinese have a lotta hells.

26:59.481 --> 27:03.860
- And what the hell is Gracie Law doing here?
- She can't get enough of me.

27:03.944 --> 27:06.571
He wishes. Look, you know me.

27:06.655 --> 27:10.075
I'm always pokin' my nose where it
doesn't belong and, I admit it,

27:10.158 --> 27:12.452
this mix-up is my fault, sort of.

27:12.535 --> 27:16.414
But I have it on good advice that the punks
thatjumped me and took his truck,

27:16.498 --> 27:20.670
they took the girl they kidnapped to the
White Tiger's for a quick sale. Who was she?

27:20.753 --> 27:25.257
- My fiancée. The White Tiger's?
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.

27:25.341 --> 27:28.970
If we go tonight, we can buy her back.
A warrant's too complicated,

27:29.053 --> 27:31.806
- violence out of the question...
- Hold it! Slow down.

27:31.889 --> 27:34.350
- I'm feelin' like an outsider here.
- You are!

27:34.433 --> 27:37.895
Jack, listen. I need more of your help.
I can't pay you today, OK?

27:37.979 --> 27:40.481
- Shit.
- How can I? I need the cash for Miao Yin.

27:40.564 --> 27:45.444
- And it's gonna cost. She's got green eyes.
- Seriously? That's an extra.

27:45.528 --> 27:48.155
It's like leather bucket seats: double the price.

27:48.239 --> 27:53.077
- Look, this Lo Pan I ran over... through...
- Has spirit-medium powers.

27:53.160 --> 27:58.041
Like the immortals.
His flesh and his bones are atomised.

27:58.125 --> 28:00.877
He becomes the dream.

28:00.961 --> 28:03.755
- What?
- That's an exaggeration, Jack, I promise.

28:03.839 --> 28:05.215
Please, help me.

28:05.590 --> 28:07.676
I got a great idea.

28:20.522 --> 28:22.608
- Relax.
- I am relaxed.

28:22.691 --> 28:26.194
Look, this is as far as I go,
because I'm a dead giveaway, see?

28:26.278 --> 28:30.240
I'd go in there with you, but they know
my face and they'd wanna push it in.

28:30.324 --> 28:32.994
- Not while I'm around.
- It's all up to you now, Jack.

28:33.077 --> 28:35.246
My destiny rests in your capable hands.

28:35.330 --> 28:37.957
- I'll do my best.
- Make them drop their guard.

28:38.041 --> 28:39.667
- I'll try.
- Look stupid.

28:39.751 --> 28:41.586
He does.

28:42.962 --> 28:45.757
Boy, it sure is rainin' cats and dogs.

28:46.591 --> 28:49.677
The cab driver said... He told me that I could...

28:49.761 --> 28:53.014
Well, that the White Tiger would...

28:54.182 --> 28:56.142
Just a minute, please.

29:02.190 --> 29:06.653
Excuse me for a second, guys.
I think I know that car.

29:11.241 --> 29:13.702
What's she doing now?

29:13.786 --> 29:15.746
Strange girl.

29:20.793 --> 29:23.337
That building there. The White Tiger.

29:23.420 --> 29:27.341
God, it's creepy. Do we have to go in?
Because I will, if we have to.

29:27.424 --> 29:30.761
I'll go anywhere or do anything
to get my story. It's my big break.

29:30.844 --> 29:35.391
Just sit tight. We've got one of our best men
inside right now, stirring the pot.

29:50.532 --> 29:55.870
How do you do, ma'am? Henry Swanson's
my name and excitement's my game.

29:55.954 --> 29:59.291
- Cash or charge?
- Gosh! Cash, I guess.

29:59.374 --> 30:01.584
I mean, it's not deductible, is it?

30:03.878 --> 30:06.840
Mrs O'Toole will take care of your needs.

30:06.923 --> 30:09.050
Boy, I wish these were in colour.

30:09.134 --> 30:12.887
Because what I really am
in the mood for is a girl with green eyes.

30:12.971 --> 30:15.598
And price is no object, Mrs O'Toole.

30:15.682 --> 30:19.728
Fresh off the boat's the way I like 'em.
The more exotic the better.

30:19.811 --> 30:22.607
Chinese girls do not come with green eyes.

30:41.334 --> 30:43.878
- Too long. Let's go in.
- It's only been ten minutes.

30:43.961 --> 30:46.047
Give the guy a chance.

30:48.424 --> 30:51.302
- So how long you been in the US of A?
- Three months.

30:51.385 --> 30:54.305
- Where from?
- Hong Kong.

30:54.388 --> 30:59.478
What happens? You stay here a while?
Old girls leave, new girls come in?

30:59.645 --> 31:03.273
Maybe. Take your tie off, please.

31:03.357 --> 31:06.568
Yeah, I know what you mean.
My wife gave it to me for Christmas.

31:10.697 --> 31:12.157
Holy shit!

32:44.293 --> 32:49.633
Green explosions? People flyin' in and out?
That was not real. I wanna talk to the cops.

32:49.716 --> 32:52.677
I want my truck back.
Now where the hell am I?

32:52.761 --> 32:56.056
- My office. Sit down.
- You sleep in your office?

32:56.139 --> 33:01.019
What I need to get straight is...
These Storms, what are they? Magicians?

33:01.102 --> 33:04.939
- Yeah, sort of. It's hard to explain.
- Try real hard.

33:05.023 --> 33:07.943
If the Storms have Miao Yin,
there's one place they'd go.

33:08.026 --> 33:12.113
Lo Pan. The godfather of Little China,
Mr David Lo Pan.

33:12.197 --> 33:15.450
You mean the Lo Pan that's
chairman of the National Orient Bank

33:15.533 --> 33:17.744
and owns the Wing Kong Trading Company,

33:17.827 --> 33:21.414
but who's so reclusive
that no one has laid eyes on him in years?

33:21.498 --> 33:23.959
Who the hell are you, anyway?

33:24.042 --> 33:27.546
I'm Margo Litzenberger.
I'm with the <i>Berkeley People's Herald.</i>

33:27.630 --> 33:32.051
I've been trying to get somebody from
the press to listen to me about this, Burton.

33:32.134 --> 33:37.056
It's not possible that you saw David Lo Pan.
The bastard's afraid to show his face.

33:37.139 --> 33:40.059
- He's got more enemies...
- He's got Miao Yin. I'm going!

33:40.142 --> 33:42.478
- Are you nuts?
- Who's that?

33:42.561 --> 33:45.523
It's OK, Tara. You can go back to sleep.

33:45.606 --> 33:47.942
- From the airport.
- This morning, sure.

33:48.025 --> 33:52.571
That's why I was there. I was protecting her
civil rights, making sure she gets a chance.

33:52.655 --> 33:56.575
This is just so shocking. I mean,
I mustjust be so monumentally naive.

33:56.659 --> 33:58.911
- You are.
- Now we have to grab your fiancée...

33:58.995 --> 34:02.165
Wait a minute! I'm a reasonable guy,

34:02.249 --> 34:04.835
but I've experienced
some unreasonable things.

34:04.918 --> 34:08.714
- It depends on how you look at it.
- The hell it does! So somebody

34:08.797 --> 34:11.174
- tell me what is goin' on!
- The truth?

34:11.257 --> 34:13.427
- I can take it.
- We don't know.

34:16.638 --> 34:20.434
- I'm going now, alone if I have to!
- Where? It's pouring out.

34:20.516 --> 34:24.187
- Lo Pan's. The Wing Kong Exchange.
- The Wing Kong Exchange?

34:24.271 --> 34:28.065
The most dangerous den of madmen
in Chinatown? You can't waltz in like...

34:28.150 --> 34:32.779
Like the wind. Yes, I can, Miss Law.
My mind and my spirits are as one.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.782
- As two. I said I was comin'.
- I'd go with you...

34:35.866 --> 34:38.786
I know. There's a problem with your face.

34:38.870 --> 34:42.956
OK! You people sit tight,
hold the fort and keep the home fires burning.

34:43.041 --> 34:46.585
If we're not back by dawn, call the president.

34:56.387 --> 35:01.976
- This is gonna take crackerjack timing.
- Total concentration. You ready, Jack?

35:02.060 --> 35:04.145
I was born ready.

35:08.232 --> 35:10.401
I love working nights.

35:10.485 --> 35:12.487
Don't get up. Phone company.

35:12.570 --> 35:16.033
All right, boys, where's the main panel?
Probably through here.

35:24.959 --> 35:26.919
Wang.

35:35.719 --> 35:39.264
Good work, Jack.
I think they actually fell for it.

35:41.684 --> 35:46.021
Well, last time we had this problem was
on account of squirrels chewin' the wires.

35:46.105 --> 35:50.275
- I'd better locate the central junction box.
- I think it's down there.

35:55.282 --> 35:56.825
What does that say?

35:56.908 --> 35:59.828
- Hell of boiling oil.
- You're kidding!

35:59.911 --> 36:02.205
Yeah, I am. It says "Keep out."

36:06.626 --> 36:09.087
We've got to do something!

36:13.883 --> 36:18.888
Goat butts against a hedge
and its horns become entangled.

36:19.764 --> 36:24.102
- I don't think I've had the pleasure.
- Miss Gracie Law, Mr Egg Shen.

36:24.185 --> 36:26.771
Egg's kind of our local authority on Lo Pan.

36:26.855 --> 36:29.442
- He's helping us out.
- It has been almost two hours.

36:29.525 --> 36:32.862
- Let's go over there, beat down the door...
- No, Miss Law.

36:32.945 --> 36:38.159
We have to gather our strength,
because now there's clouds and thunder.

36:38.242 --> 36:41.621
The image of difficulty at the beginning.

36:41.704 --> 36:45.541
But finally we shall bring order out of chaos.

36:50.588 --> 36:53.215
- Look.
- Yeah.

36:53.299 --> 36:56.260
What you got here is two
people dragging a third.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.429
Miao Yin!

37:12.819 --> 37:16.573
- You did that, right?
- I guess so. I hope so.

37:22.162 --> 37:24.456
Jack, check this out.

37:25.749 --> 37:27.834
So what is this? Chinese or somethin'?

37:27.918 --> 37:30.629
- Countin' backwards?
- Not backwards. Downwards.

37:41.056 --> 37:46.062
Of course the Chinese mix everything up.
Look at what they have to work with.

37:46.145 --> 37:51.025
There's Buddhism, Confucianism
and Taoist alchemy and sorcery.

37:51.317 --> 37:55.530
We take what we want and leave the rest.
Just like your salad bar.

37:55.613 --> 37:59.659
But there is one thing
even David Lo Pan must acknowledge.

37:59.742 --> 38:06.249
All movement in the universe is caused by
tension between positive and negative furies.

38:06.332 --> 38:10.753
- So when the furies are out of balance...
- As they are in Lo Pan, who is cursed.

38:10.837 --> 38:14.007
Then the people
turn into demons and live for ever.

38:14.090 --> 38:18.428
Repulsive and evil,
existing only to plague the living.

38:18.512 --> 38:23.767
Well then, what you're saying is
this David Lo Pan... What is he? A ghost?

38:23.851 --> 38:29.898
Plays at being a man.
A creature of vast, dark, destructive power.

38:30.399 --> 38:35.487
All right, out this hatch and up the cable.
Does that sound like a brilliant idea or what?

38:35.571 --> 38:38.490
The cable is three storeys high
and covered with grease.

38:38.574 --> 38:42.494
Exactly. It's real and we can touch it,
so at least we know where we stand.

38:42.578 --> 38:44.371
Yeah, in deep shit.

38:47.082 --> 38:49.668
- What?
- What the hell...?

38:51.545 --> 38:53.047
- Shit!
- See?

38:53.130 --> 38:56.051
You think they'd let us
walk in and out like the wind?

38:56.134 --> 38:58.845
Yes.
I thought that was your whole damn point!

38:58.928 --> 39:01.306
My point was to find Miao Yin at any cost!

39:01.389 --> 39:04.309
- This is salt water, Wang.
- And get your truck back!

39:04.392 --> 39:08.021
- I'll buy another one.
- But there's only one Miao Yin!

39:36.008 --> 39:38.094
Jesus Christ! Where are we?

39:38.177 --> 39:40.680
Hell of the upside-down sinners!

39:55.111 --> 39:59.323
Hey, you! Come on over here
and fight like a man!

40:38.488 --> 40:42.034
Shit, Jack. I don't like the looks of this.

40:44.703 --> 40:47.081
- Where are we, Wang?
- You are nowhere!

41:13.358 --> 41:15.276
Oh, boy.

41:15.360 --> 41:18.321
Look, we came here to see David Lo Pan,
all right?

41:19.030 --> 41:20.698
David Lo Pan?

41:20.782 --> 41:24.370
- Then you have succeeded, Mr Burton.
- What, you?

41:25.287 --> 41:28.457
- I don't get this at all. I thought...
- Shut up, Mr Burton!

41:28.540 --> 41:32.628
- You are not put upon this world to "get it".
- Come on! Lo Pan is like...

41:32.711 --> 41:34.588
Nothing you can understand.

41:34.672 --> 41:39.927
There are many mysteries and unanswerable
questions, even in a life as short as yours.

41:40.010 --> 41:43.681
The way I see it, it doesn't mean
we shouldn't ask. Where's my truck?

41:43.764 --> 41:48.143
You are not looking for a truck. You're
looking for a girl. A girl with green eyes.

41:48.227 --> 41:51.563
- Yes.
- She must be something extraordinary.

41:51.647 --> 41:54.274
Or I'm not about to waste another 2,000 years.

41:54.358 --> 41:57.903
There can't be many Chinese girls
with green eyes these days.

41:57.987 --> 42:01.282
- There are not. Never were.
- So beggars can't be choosers.

42:01.366 --> 42:03.451
But I can!

42:04.244 --> 42:07.080
Tell me about Miao Yin.

42:07.163 --> 42:09.457
What province is she from? Hunan?

42:10.166 --> 42:14.296
Her mother? Her father?
He must be a holy man. I must know.

42:14.379 --> 42:17.924
You got a tongue, Dave. Ask her yourself.

42:23.054 --> 42:27.851
Mr Burton, if you have an influence over
your youthful friend, you better exert it now.

42:27.934 --> 42:31.980
Otherwise I will send both of you to
the hell where people are skinned alive.

42:32.063 --> 42:34.441
It's that simple. Understand?

42:35.484 --> 42:39.238
- Are you crazy? Is that your problem?
- No, he means it, Jack.

42:39.322 --> 42:44.452
My problem is this place.
This place is my tomb. I'm buried here.

42:44.535 --> 42:50.666
A young man, a king, a warrior,
is entombed in this old man's crippled body.

42:52.335 --> 42:54.879
And all I need is a woman, Mr Burton,

42:54.962 --> 42:58.215
a special kind of woman
with dragon-green eyes,

42:58.299 --> 43:03.721
to make me whole and young again, so that I
may rule the universe from beyond the grave.

43:03.804 --> 43:07.141
- Ch'ing-ti. The God of the East.
- Who, him? This guy?

43:07.224 --> 43:09.226
No, not me, Mr Burton.

43:10.603 --> 43:15.150
My demon. The god I must appease
in order to regain my heart, my blood.

43:15.776 --> 43:19.488
A girl with green eyes to satisfy Ch'ing-ti,

43:19.571 --> 43:22.449
a girl brave enough
to embrace the naked blade.

43:22.532 --> 43:24.743
- When I find her, I will marry her.
- Never!

43:24.826 --> 43:27.245
Ch'ing-ti will be happy and my curse lifted.

43:27.329 --> 43:30.165
You can rule the universe
from beyond the grave.

43:30.248 --> 43:32.668
- Indeed!
- Or check into a psycho ward.

43:32.751 --> 43:35.170
Whichever comes first.

43:35.253 --> 43:40.133
What, I'm supposed to buy this shit? 2,000
years and he can't find a broad to fit the bill?

43:40.217 --> 43:43.345
Come on, Dave, you must be doin'
somethin' seriously wrong.

43:43.428 --> 43:49.143
There have been others, to be sure.
There are always others, are there not?

43:49.227 --> 43:53.398
You seem to be one who knows
the difficulties between men and women,

43:53.481 --> 43:55.858
how seldom it works out.

43:56.401 --> 43:59.779
And yet we all keep trying, like fools.

44:01.864 --> 44:07.662
Who are these people? Friends of yours?
Now this really pisses me off to no end!

44:07.745 --> 44:11.332
- Come on, stick around!
- Where's Miao Yin? In this building?

44:11.416 --> 44:13.042
- Safe.
- Where is she?

44:13.126 --> 44:16.671
Safe.
Safer with me than any creature on earth!

44:18.172 --> 44:21.175
Go ahead. You want bad publicity?
Give us the run-around.

44:21.259 --> 44:25.472
But this woman has a deadline,
and her pen is mightier than your sword.

44:25.556 --> 44:28.350
- Yeah.
- No visitors.

44:28.434 --> 44:32.771
- I don't make the policy around here.
- Come on, man! Give 'em a tour.

44:32.855 --> 44:35.232
What's it gonna hurt?

44:36.317 --> 44:38.652
I can help you.

45:07.557 --> 45:10.060
- Are you OK, Jack?
- Yeah.

45:12.312 --> 45:16.358
We're in a room.
No windows, a few skeletons.

45:16.441 --> 45:19.569
- Where's the light coming from?
- The floor.

45:35.001 --> 45:38.589
With the easing of trade restrictions,

45:38.673 --> 45:43.594
next year we'll start importing
a lot of strange things from Peking.

45:43.678 --> 45:46.722
What sort of strange things?

45:46.806 --> 45:49.225
Are we going up or down?

45:49.308 --> 45:51.394
It feels like down.

46:11.122 --> 46:13.624
Great. Thank you, Jack.

46:13.708 --> 46:18.714
I think we've come up. First we went down.
Now they've brought us up.

46:19.798 --> 46:24.720
Two, three feet thick, I'll bet. Probably
welded shut and covered with brick by now.

46:24.803 --> 46:28.724
- Don't give up, Jack.
- OK. Let's just chew our way outta here!

46:28.807 --> 46:31.435
Lo Pan has plans for us,
or we'd be dead doornails.

46:31.518 --> 46:36.648
Which Lo Pan? Little old basket case
on wheels, or the ten-foot-tall roadblock?

46:36.732 --> 46:41.695
- One and the same person, Jack.
- You know something you're not tellin' me.

46:41.778 --> 46:44.197
Myths and legends.

46:44.948 --> 46:48.243
- I don't wanna insult you.
- No, no. Go ahead.

46:49.077 --> 46:50.662
Insult me.

46:52.623 --> 46:56.127
It's about all sorts of scary things:
an ancient army of the dead,

46:56.210 --> 46:59.756
the Spirit City and monkey sacrifices.

46:59.839 --> 47:02.008
The First Sovereign Emperor of China,

47:02.091 --> 47:06.095
that mad monarch who federated our
seven warring states, defeated Lo Pan

47:06.179 --> 47:11.434
and imposed upon him
that horrible curse of no flesh in 272 BC.

47:12.352 --> 47:16.731
A lot of Chinese hear these things
when we're kids, then we grow up,

47:17.690 --> 47:19.817
and pretend not to believe them.

47:20.401 --> 47:23.321
- No horseshit, Wang.
- No horseshit, Jack.

47:23.404 --> 47:28.786
I don't blame you. I'm Chinese and I don't
even wanna believe it, but it's for real.

47:28.869 --> 47:31.372
Sorcery, the Chinese black magic.

47:36.752 --> 47:38.837
Blindfolds!

47:57.940 --> 48:00.067
You make one move...

48:06.241 --> 48:10.120
Now, let's try that again.
Don't make me kill you, tough guy.

48:11.955 --> 48:13.915
Come on, Jack!

48:14.374 --> 48:16.459
- Come on!
- How?

49:10.973 --> 49:12.975
- Great work, Jack.
- Yeah.

49:13.059 --> 49:18.315
We're all in: me, Gracie and Margo. Uncle Chu
and Egg are in Egg's bus, ready to get us out.

49:18.398 --> 49:19.900
- Right.
- Here, Jack.

49:19.983 --> 49:22.069
I'll trade ya.

49:23.278 --> 49:25.822
All right, which way?
Fast, before they wake up.

49:25.906 --> 49:28.533
There, I think. Down there.

49:34.873 --> 49:36.958
No pathetic excuses.

49:37.959 --> 49:44.174
I smell the blood of human beings.
Find them. Boil them until their flesh falls off.

49:44.591 --> 49:46.677
You heard me!

50:42.818 --> 50:44.903
Empty.

50:47.239 --> 50:49.908
I need you, Miao Yin.

50:50.326 --> 50:54.913
You, whose eyes flash like emerald lightning.

50:55.956 --> 50:59.918
Ch'ing-ti, make me flesh again soon.

51:02.004 --> 51:03.547
Please.

51:05.257 --> 51:07.134
Let's go. It's clear.

51:12.974 --> 51:15.060
Safety!

51:18.938 --> 51:20.523
Wang!

51:26.446 --> 51:29.157
First time you ever plugged somebody?

51:29.783 --> 51:31.743
- Course not.
- Come on!

51:33.578 --> 51:35.413
You wanna go up or down?

51:35.497 --> 51:37.582
- Up or down?
- Up.

52:00.272 --> 52:04.276
All has become strange.

52:05.236 --> 52:11.158
A world so unreal and yet,
at once, so frightening.

52:34.683 --> 52:37.644
Open up or I'll blow his head off!

52:40.814 --> 52:43.734
Open! Or he dies in the name of Ch'ing-ti

52:43.817 --> 52:47.696
and your souls speed with his
to the hell of the oily dragon!

53:14.891 --> 53:17.060
- You all right?
- Yeah.

53:21.773 --> 53:23.650
- Margo!
- Jack!

53:23.733 --> 53:27.528
- Where's Gracie?
- On the floor next door. She's a wildcat.

53:27.612 --> 53:31.282
- How are you gonna spring us?
- I have no idea.

54:08.821 --> 54:11.324
That way maybe.

54:14.911 --> 54:16.997
Wang, haul ass!

54:31.803 --> 54:33.722
Come on, keep movin'!

54:35.348 --> 54:36.891
Margo, jump in!

54:38.560 --> 54:40.854
- In there? Are you nuts?
- Go!

55:12.178 --> 55:14.680
- Where's Margo?
- I don't know.

55:18.059 --> 55:19.018
Where are we?

55:19.101 --> 55:21.395
- Where's Eddie?
- Beats me.

55:24.524 --> 55:26.610
Where's Jack?

55:28.445 --> 55:30.530
Jack!

55:32.491 --> 55:34.576
Jack?

55:36.578 --> 55:38.664
Jack!

55:41.875 --> 55:47.255
- Sorry, I'm just thrilled to be alive.
- Yeah, sure. Let's go.

55:54.096 --> 55:57.724
- It's like some giant garbage disposal.
- I think it is, sort of.

55:57.808 --> 56:01.813
Will you just stop rubbing
your body up against mine?

56:01.896 --> 56:04.023
I can't concentrate when you do that.

56:04.107 --> 56:08.111
What a pig you are, Burton! I mean, really!

56:10.655 --> 56:14.659
- Where's Jack?
- It's OK. Everybody relax. I'm here.

56:14.742 --> 56:18.162
Jack, I know where we are.
This is a central... what do you call it?

56:18.246 --> 56:20.999
- Sewer?
- Yeah. Water comes in up there.

56:21.082 --> 56:25.837
Seawater from the bay fills this room. They
divert it through pipes to different chambers.

56:25.920 --> 56:29.465
I bet up there's where
we first got on that elevator.

56:57.202 --> 57:00.706
All right, we're almost outta here.
From here on, it gets normal.

57:00.789 --> 57:03.000
Offices, storerooms: a nice false front.

57:03.083 --> 57:06.587
I count to three, open the door, and we go.

57:06.670 --> 57:08.630
- Everybody got that?
- Ready?

57:08.714 --> 57:11.216
Follow the leader. One, two, three.

57:15.221 --> 57:16.973
We may be trapped.

57:20.018 --> 57:22.354
Hide!

57:22.437 --> 57:26.191
- Hide?
- Hide! They only saw me!

57:30.070 --> 57:32.614
We fight together, Jack. Do or die.

58:23.541 --> 58:25.084
Time to go.

58:29.840 --> 58:32.968
The bus is right outside in the parking lot.

58:54.156 --> 58:59.077
Here's the deal. I run interference and
you bring up the rear. Can you handle that?

58:59.161 --> 59:00.120
Can you?

59:00.662 --> 59:04.125
Well, what a night's work!
You got a problem like that again,

59:04.208 --> 59:07.045
- you reach for the sky!
- Let's go!

59:09.297 --> 59:11.382
Come on, come on.

59:12.592 --> 59:15.720
- You're doin' real good, guys.
- Come on, Jack!

59:17.638 --> 59:20.350
Let's go! Open the doors!

59:23.770 --> 59:25.897
- Hurry!
- Move it, Egg!

59:27.523 --> 59:29.442
Duck!

59:45.501 --> 59:48.629
We made it. Holy shit, we made it!

59:49.296 --> 59:52.174
- Where's Miao Yin?
- Inside.

59:52.758 --> 59:54.468
Somewhere inside.

59:57.513 --> 59:59.139
Where's Gracie?

01:00:15.572 --> 01:00:18.743
Put me down, you overstuffed monster!

01:00:22.872 --> 01:00:25.709
Let me go! Let me go!

01:01:03.831 --> 01:01:05.958
What does it mean?

01:01:06.042 --> 01:01:08.753
Two girls with green eyes?

01:01:08.836 --> 01:01:10.963
After all these years.

01:01:11.047 --> 01:01:16.594
You bastards! Unchain me! You're not
gonna get away with this. Where's Lo Pan?

01:01:18.512 --> 01:01:20.765
This one has fire as well!

01:01:20.848 --> 01:01:24.769
Listen,
I've had it up to here with you maniacs.

01:01:24.852 --> 01:01:28.981
I wanna see that disgusting
flesh-peddler David Lo Pan in person.

01:01:29.065 --> 01:01:34.112
Unless the coward's afraid to see
an unarmed girl one-on-one!

01:01:34.655 --> 01:01:36.740
Where is he?

01:01:45.999 --> 01:01:50.879
You know what this is?
This is like some radical <i>Alice In Wonderland.</i>

01:01:50.962 --> 01:01:55.133
- That's what this is.
- Then you've got a best seller on your hands.

01:01:55.217 --> 01:02:01.181
- Call the police. You're not a one-man army.
- Cops got better things to do than get killed.

01:02:04.601 --> 01:02:06.353
Here he is, Jack.

01:02:06.436 --> 01:02:10.108
No, these are our friends.
These are the Chang Sings.

01:02:10.191 --> 01:02:13.486
- Any of 'em savvy English?
- Hey, man. Who is this guy?

01:02:13.569 --> 01:02:15.405
All right. You got any guns?

01:02:15.488 --> 01:02:20.952
Not against Lo Pan, but here's one for you
to make you feel better, like Dirty Harry.

01:02:21.035 --> 01:02:24.122
I'll stick with these. You comin' with us, Egg?

01:02:24.205 --> 01:02:29.127
Of course, Jack. It's my destiny. Besides,
if I don't you'll never make it out alive.

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:31.796
- I'm on board too then.
- Yeah, sure, kid.

01:02:31.879 --> 01:02:35.633
- You can't keep the press out. It's America.
- You're not going back there.

01:02:35.717 --> 01:02:38.302
You're stayin' here with Eddie and Uncle Chu.

01:02:38.386 --> 01:02:41.431
- Eddie? But he's...
- He's got a crush on you.

01:02:41.848 --> 01:02:46.145
- You mean like you've got on Gracie?
- Are you kidding? I just want my truck back.

01:02:46.228 --> 01:02:49.565
What do I know?
She's not even your type. All brains.

01:02:49.648 --> 01:02:51.734
Come on, let's go!

01:03:00.451 --> 01:03:04.204
Play your cards right, you live to talk about it.

01:03:27.145 --> 01:03:29.230
Oh, boy.

01:03:30.398 --> 01:03:33.485
Are you OK? Are you Miao Yin?

01:03:33.568 --> 01:03:36.863
Yes. Miao Yin.

01:03:37.197 --> 01:03:39.949
- Who are you?
- Lo Pan.

01:03:40.033 --> 01:03:43.578
You have come to seek me out
with your green eyes.

01:03:43.662 --> 01:03:45.705
Yes.

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:47.749
- No, no.
- Yes.

01:03:49.626 --> 01:03:55.256
- What's going on here? Some kind of...?
- Magic. The darkest magic.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:04:01.639
My soul swims in it, scattered across time,
trapped in the world of formlessness.

01:04:02.056 --> 01:04:06.060
Until I find her and marry her.

01:04:06.143 --> 01:04:07.520
Marry her?

01:04:07.603 --> 01:04:12.817
The girl with green eyes.
The girl who can tame the burning blade.

01:04:14.902 --> 01:04:19.323
Miao Yin or Grace Law.

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:34.006
- Great start. It's the other way.
- The front door will get you nowhere.

01:04:34.089 --> 01:04:37.718
- Here, let me hold that.
- A brave man likes to feel nature on his face.

01:04:37.801 --> 01:04:41.054
And a wise man has enough sense
to get in out of the rain.

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:55.861
- He lives here?
- He owns the block. He's a rich guy.

01:04:55.944 --> 01:04:59.281
- Rich? This place is a dump, Wang.
- To Western eyes.

01:04:59.364 --> 01:05:02.284
The stuff in these bottles is priceless.

01:05:03.618 --> 01:05:06.621
Well, all set?

01:05:07.622 --> 01:05:10.209
Yeah. Ready when you are, Egg.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.397
- Jack next.
- Where does it go?

01:05:31.481 --> 01:05:34.400
- Down. Lo Pan is down there.
- Down where?

01:05:34.484 --> 01:05:37.487
- Where is the universe?
- Come on, Jack. Don't be afraid.

01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:39.656
Afraid? Are you kidding?

01:05:53.879 --> 01:05:58.175
- Where in the hell are we?
- Underneath Chinatown.

01:06:58.778 --> 01:07:01.115
That is not water.

01:07:01.198 --> 01:07:03.659
Black blood of the earth.

01:07:03.743 --> 01:07:08.039
- Do you mean oil?
- I mean black blood of the earth.

01:07:08.122 --> 01:07:13.336
A thousand years ago, huge earthquakes
turned the world upside down.

01:07:15.588 --> 01:07:18.090
Many normal people were killed.

01:07:20.343 --> 01:07:24.430
Many unnatural people roam free

01:07:24.513 --> 01:07:29.101
to commit great offences against the gods.

01:09:15.461 --> 01:09:20.466
They have survived the burning blade,
tamed the savage heart.

01:09:23.301 --> 01:09:25.595
I will marry both women.

01:09:27.557 --> 01:09:30.143
Prepare them.

01:09:44.741 --> 01:09:46.826
What is that?

01:09:48.536 --> 01:09:52.540
- It sounds like...
- Something breathing underwater?

01:09:52.624 --> 01:09:54.292
Yeah.

01:10:04.095 --> 01:10:06.180
You will come out no more!

01:10:06.263 --> 01:10:09.934
What? What'll come out no more?

01:10:10.017 --> 01:10:12.269
Come on.

01:10:12.353 --> 01:10:14.438
Dammit!

01:10:27.243 --> 01:10:29.328
Miao Yin?

01:11:07.909 --> 01:11:10.037
Hey, Wang!

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.706
- Egg!
- Jack, come on!

01:11:27.513 --> 01:11:30.933
It's OK, Jack. Wing Kong storeroom.
Emergency provisions.

01:11:31.017 --> 01:11:33.978
We're inside Lo Pan's domain.

01:11:34.062 --> 01:11:35.980
Christ!

01:11:38.775 --> 01:11:39.901
Later.

01:11:39.984 --> 01:11:44.614
We're getting close. Real close.
And now for some more bad news. Ready?

01:11:44.697 --> 01:11:49.202
- This gets worse? Come on!
- 2,258 years ago

01:11:49.285 --> 01:11:51.788
the First Sovereign Emperor...

01:11:53.248 --> 01:11:56.877
He subjugated Lo Pan, made him of no flesh.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:01.757
- Only an evil dream.
- Get to the goddamn point, Egg.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:07.054
In order to be whole again, he had to find
this certain girl of his prophecy,

01:12:07.137 --> 01:12:09.807
and marry her to appease the God of the East.

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:13.018
But to appease the emperor,
he had to kill her.

01:12:13.102 --> 01:12:14.937
Kill her? No!

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:19.149
Well, let's go. What are we talkin'
Chinese history for when we gotta get...

01:12:19.233 --> 01:12:22.736
We are getting ready to strike the final blow.

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:26.490
- If we reach Lo Pan...
- When we reach Lo Pan.

01:12:26.573 --> 01:12:29.368
...then the power in this flask
will be our only hope

01:12:29.452 --> 01:12:34.374
against the Bodhisattva of the underworld,
the ultimate evil spirit.

01:12:35.458 --> 01:12:39.462
Yes. Only a dream can kill a dream.

01:12:39.838 --> 01:12:42.716
I've waited for this for a long time, Jack.

01:12:43.925 --> 01:12:46.553
The evil dream will die.

01:12:52.976 --> 01:12:54.185
Wing Kong outside.

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:24.508
- Were they real?
- Yeah. Dressed for Lo Pan's wedding.

01:13:24.592 --> 01:13:26.677
What's in the flask? Magic potion?

01:13:26.761 --> 01:13:29.221
- Yeah.
- Thought so. Good. Do we drink it?

01:13:29.305 --> 01:13:31.057
- Yeah.
- Good. Thought so.

01:14:07.469 --> 01:14:11.932
I am the past,
come back to haunt you, Lo Pan!

01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:18.563
My God, no! Please!
What is that? Don't tell me.

01:14:18.647 --> 01:14:22.985
A guardian. What it sees, Lo Pan knows.

01:14:23.069 --> 01:14:25.530
They have returned.

01:14:25.613 --> 01:14:29.784
And this time they are not alone.
Egg Shen is with them.

01:14:29.867 --> 01:14:35.540
Little bastard sorcerer has brought them
through the Bog of the Dead Trees.

01:14:35.623 --> 01:14:37.333
Egg Shen?

01:14:37.417 --> 01:14:42.380
Egg Shen! You have come
a long ways to find me, but it is too late.

01:14:42.463 --> 01:14:46.801
There are two girls with green eyes,
and I will marry them both.

01:14:46.884 --> 01:14:50.221
And then I will sacrifice Gracie Law
to appease my emperor,

01:14:50.304 --> 01:14:54.559
and live out my earthly pleasures
with Miao Yin.

01:14:57.187 --> 01:15:00.441
That's right, Egg Shen.
The best of two worlds.

01:15:07.322 --> 01:15:09.908
You never know till you try.

01:15:09.992 --> 01:15:12.077
Let's get outta here.

01:15:22.546 --> 01:15:25.424
You know what I don't like?
Where is everybody?

01:15:25.507 --> 01:15:27.801
Preparing for Lo Pan's wedding.

01:15:38.355 --> 01:15:42.150
We should not be in here, not this easily.
It's a setup, I'm tellin' ya.

01:15:42.233 --> 01:15:45.695
Lo Pan is about to take his queen.
He's too busy to care.

01:15:45.779 --> 01:15:48.531
So where is he, Egg? Where?

01:16:20.106 --> 01:16:22.191
- Jack, here!
- What?

01:16:25.778 --> 01:16:27.863
- Hollow.
- Fuck it.

01:16:32.493 --> 01:16:36.205
- I know. It's an elevator. It only goes down.
- Yeah, look.

01:16:36.288 --> 01:16:40.209
- Hey, all right!
- Time for the medicine!

01:16:47.968 --> 01:16:51.596
- Cheers!
- This does what again, exactly?

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.307
Huge buzz.

01:16:55.225 --> 01:16:57.102
Good!

01:16:57.185 --> 01:17:01.481
You can see things no one else can see,
do things no one else can do.

01:17:01.565 --> 01:17:03.859
- Real things?
- As real as Lo Pan.

01:17:03.942 --> 01:17:08.030
- What more can a guy ask for?
- The six-demon bag!

01:17:08.113 --> 01:17:11.867
Terrific. A six-demon bag.
Sensational. What's in it, Egg?

01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:14.745
Wind! Fire! All that kind of thing.

01:17:14.828 --> 01:17:17.331
Here's to the army and navy
and the battles they have won.

01:17:17.414 --> 01:17:20.125
Here's to America's colours,
the colours that never run.

01:17:20.208 --> 01:17:22.920
May the wings of liberty never lose a feather.

01:17:37.977 --> 01:17:41.397
I feel pretty good. You know, I'm not...

01:17:41.481 --> 01:17:44.484
I'm not scared at all. I just feel kind of...

01:17:45.485 --> 01:17:48.237
- I feel kind of invincible.
- Me too.

01:17:48.321 --> 01:17:52.283
- I got a very positive attitude about this.
- Good. Me too.

01:17:58.122 --> 01:18:00.668
Is it gettin' hot in here, or is itjust me?

01:18:00.959 --> 01:18:03.879
Ch'ing-ti! Ch'ing-ti!

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:08.425
Great Ch'ing-ti, equal with heaven,

01:18:08.509 --> 01:18:14.473
come into our presence
and witness this holy matrimony.

01:18:14.556 --> 01:18:18.268
- Miao Yin.
- And the ultimate evil spirit.

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:26.985
And now, my beloved disciples,

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:29.488
the moment of truth.

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:32.116
The needle of love.

01:18:35.619 --> 01:18:38.623
- I'd like to shoot that bastard.
- Not until he's married.

01:18:38.707 --> 01:18:41.334
- Then he's flesh.
- Then it's too late.

01:18:41.418 --> 01:18:43.670
Ch'ing-ti!

01:18:43.753 --> 01:18:48.550
You, who shake the heavens
and descend from the east,

01:18:48.633 --> 01:18:52.345
all I ask in order to conquer this universe

01:18:52.429 --> 01:18:56.808
is that you grant me flesh and blood.

01:18:58.601 --> 01:19:01.730
Yes! Guide my hand

01:19:02.522 --> 01:19:06.693
as I insert this needle into Miao Yin.

01:19:07.569 --> 01:19:11.406
Let him complete the ceremony.
Then he is ours for certain!

01:19:11.489 --> 01:19:14.076
Come, my love. Give it to me.

01:19:27.256 --> 01:19:29.175
It's working!

01:19:30.801 --> 01:19:32.887
I'm mortal!

01:19:41.312 --> 01:19:43.314
Look out, guys!

01:19:58.914 --> 01:20:00.582
No way!

01:21:04.106 --> 01:21:06.400
Come, Miao Yin, it won't hurt.

01:22:07.253 --> 01:22:08.713
Shit!

01:22:16.972 --> 01:22:18.265
Take her.

01:22:41.288 --> 01:22:43.582
Peasant magic!

01:23:18.952 --> 01:23:21.038
You never could beat me, Egg Shen.

01:24:27.314 --> 01:24:28.774
- It's me.
- Are you all right?

01:24:28.857 --> 01:24:32.027
- Never mind me. We gotta get Lo Pan.
- Where is he?

01:24:32.111 --> 01:24:33.487
Wang!

01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:35.364
Come on.

01:24:37.366 --> 01:24:39.451
Pull it apart. Come on!

01:25:06.646 --> 01:25:10.942
- Where does this go?
- Up. To Lo Pan's office. It's cooler up there.

01:25:11.026 --> 01:25:14.112
- From there we can...
- Do you have a gun, I hope?

01:25:14.195 --> 01:25:17.615
- I have a knife.
- A knife? He's 12 feet tall!

01:25:17.699 --> 01:25:20.995
Seven. Don't worry.
I can handle him. I took something.

01:25:21.078 --> 01:25:23.789
I can see things no one else can see.

01:25:25.041 --> 01:25:28.627
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I was getting married.

01:25:28.711 --> 01:25:33.883
He was marrying both of us,
just because my eyes are green too.

01:25:43.142 --> 01:25:45.728
Oh, God. Is this really happening?

01:25:52.985 --> 01:25:56.281
- Look into my eyes.
- No! Never!

01:25:56.365 --> 01:26:00.285
I have suffered so much pain and agony.
Look at me!

01:26:00.369 --> 01:26:04.164
No! I don't understand. I don't belong to you!

01:26:04.247 --> 01:26:08.085
No, you don't. You belong to Ch'ing-ti.

01:26:08.168 --> 01:26:11.004
I must sacrifice you,
but I love you and I need you.

01:26:11.088 --> 01:26:13.298
No!

01:26:13.382 --> 01:26:15.592
Here, take her! Take the bitch!

01:26:15.676 --> 01:26:18.512
- Master, you are flesh!
- I am?

01:26:19.137 --> 01:26:22.140
I am! It worked!

01:26:22.224 --> 01:26:25.018
Ch'ing-ti is appeased.

01:26:25.394 --> 01:26:30.732
Now we must satisfy the First
Sovereign Emperor by destroying this!

01:26:30.816 --> 01:26:33.027
Not so fast, gentlemen.

01:26:33.111 --> 01:26:36.781
Is it too much to ask, Thunder?
Kill him! For me!

01:26:36.864 --> 01:26:41.703
It won't solve anything, Dave. Too many
people have been droppin' like flies already

01:26:41.786 --> 01:26:45.415
and where's that gettin' us? Nowhere, fast.

01:26:45.498 --> 01:26:48.918
Nah, you know what Jack Burton
always says at a time like this?

01:26:49.001 --> 01:26:52.004
- Who?
- Jack Burton. Me!

01:27:00.346 --> 01:27:02.515
Old Jack always says

01:27:03.016 --> 01:27:05.143
"What the hell?"

01:27:30.919 --> 01:27:32.379
It's a good knife.

01:27:34.798 --> 01:27:36.675
Goodbye, Mr Burton.

01:28:00.909 --> 01:28:03.411
It's all in the reflexes.

01:28:06.539 --> 01:28:08.249
Wang!

01:28:15.924 --> 01:28:18.093
You all right?

01:28:18.176 --> 01:28:20.345
- Hey, thanks.
- Wait a minute.

01:28:56.090 --> 01:28:58.175
I don't think he's gonna stop!

01:29:02.514 --> 01:29:04.016
Come on!

01:29:23.869 --> 01:29:26.371
- We got a problem.
- There!

01:29:58.071 --> 01:30:00.490
Come on, Jack!

01:30:02.408 --> 01:30:04.494
Jump, Jack!

01:30:14.630 --> 01:30:17.508
- This whole place is melting!
- Hello! Hello!

01:30:18.384 --> 01:30:22.513
- How'd you get up there?
- It wasn't easy! Stand aside!

01:30:27.226 --> 01:30:29.436
Take it away!

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.959
Hang onto this.

01:30:53.169 --> 01:30:55.171
Watch out, Wang Chi!

01:31:04.639 --> 01:31:06.725
Go for it, Wang!

01:31:27.455 --> 01:31:30.332
- Go!
- Come on, Jack, hurry!

01:31:32.334 --> 01:31:34.920
There's my truck... My truck!

01:31:35.004 --> 01:31:37.465
Get in.

01:31:59.028 --> 01:32:01.155
- They took the key.
- Do you have a spare?

01:32:01.238 --> 01:32:04.159
Course I do, but it's underneath the...

01:32:06.745 --> 01:32:10.540
- What was that?
- 6.9 on the Richter scale. Hang on!

01:32:19.007 --> 01:32:21.551
- Sorry.
- Don't you know how to drive this thing?

01:32:21.635 --> 01:32:23.220
Relax.

01:32:37.234 --> 01:32:39.529
Stop! Red light!

01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:46.160
Take it easy. OK, we made it.

01:32:47.704 --> 01:32:48.830
Yeah.

01:32:48.913 --> 01:32:53.042
Look at that.
Doesn't that make you feel good?

01:32:53.126 --> 01:32:55.211
Terrific.

01:32:56.504 --> 01:32:58.798
The light's green. You can go.

01:33:17.401 --> 01:33:20.529
- What are you doin', Jack?
- I'll be right back.

01:33:20.612 --> 01:33:23.115
Where are you goin', Egg?

01:33:23.824 --> 01:33:25.909
My work's done.

01:33:26.618 --> 01:33:30.581
Lo Pan is dead and the evil spell's been lifted.

01:33:31.707 --> 01:33:35.169
Years ago I promised myself a long vacation.

01:33:35.252 --> 01:33:37.254
It is time to collect.

01:33:37.337 --> 01:33:40.674
Well, why don't you go on over to China?
Visit the motherland?

01:33:40.758 --> 01:33:45.345
Well, China's in the heart, Jack.
Wherever I go, she's with me.

01:33:47.848 --> 01:33:52.145
- So what are you gonna call it?
- I don't know.

01:33:52.228 --> 01:33:57.400
Maybe you can come over to my place later
and help me find a title?

01:33:59.486 --> 01:34:02.739
- Here, Jack. Nothin' or triple.
- Nothin' or double.

01:34:02.822 --> 01:34:05.575
Triple. You earned it.

01:34:05.909 --> 01:34:08.620
You're right, I did. Thanks, Wang.

01:34:11.831 --> 01:34:14.417
Well, last chance. I'm a rich man now.

01:34:14.501 --> 01:34:18.338
I can give up the open road,
sell my truck, settle down.

01:34:18.838 --> 01:34:21.424
Couldn't have that on my conscience.

01:34:21.508 --> 01:34:24.344
The only way it might work
is if you buy a bigger truck

01:34:24.427 --> 01:34:27.932
with a cosy little apartment
in back, just big enough for two.

01:34:28.015 --> 01:34:33.396
That sounds pretty great. But sooner or later
I rub everybody the wrong way.

01:34:35.398 --> 01:34:37.692
Well, let me think about it.

01:34:41.404 --> 01:34:45.241
God, aren't you even
gonna kiss her goodbye?

01:34:49.036 --> 01:34:50.579
No.

01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:55.918
- See you around, Burton.
- Never can tell.

01:35:00.965 --> 01:35:03.050
Bye, Jack.

01:35:06.513 --> 01:35:09.891
We really shook the pillars of heaven,
didn't we, Wang?

01:35:09.975 --> 01:35:12.686
- No horseshit, Jack.
- No horseshit.

01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:38.378
You just listen to the Pork-Chop Express
and take his advice

01:35:38.462 --> 01:35:42.425
on a stormy night, when the lightning's
crashin', the thunder's roarin',

01:35:42.508 --> 01:35:46.304
and the rain's comin' down
in sheets thick as lead.

01:35:46.387 --> 01:35:49.348
Remember what old Jack Burton does
when the earth quakes

01:35:49.432 --> 01:35:54.354
and the poison arrows fall from the sky
and the pillars of heaven shake.

01:35:54.437 --> 01:35:59.317
Yeah, Jack Burton just looks that big old
storm right square in the eye and he says

01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:03.071
"Gimme your best shot, pal. I can take it."
