01:19.920 --> 01:23.515
Kids! Tell your father
it's time for work.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.234
And hurry,
we don't want him to be late.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.192
Come on.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.799
Peg.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.719
I can't go to work,
I've got the chickenpox.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.113
It hurts!

01:47.320 --> 01:50.039
Al, it's just iodine.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.596
Now, you tried that trick
on our wedding day.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.916
You think if you really had
the chickenpox...

01:57.120 --> 01:59.509
...we'd let you in the house?

01:59.960 --> 02:01.757
Now, go to work.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.479
Kids, encourage your father.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.750
We love you.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.511
Have a good day, Dad.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.798
Good.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.310
Now, here's the lunch
and the garbage.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.152
Gee, Peg, I can't believe
you actually made my lunch.

02:20.360 --> 02:24.273
Well, I just took the garbage
and separated it into two bags.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.950
Give them shoe hell, Harry.

02:29.480 --> 02:30.993
I'm going.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.714
Going to work.
I'm gonna miss you, honey.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.637
Holy moly! Yikes and gadzooks!

02:47.600 --> 02:50.672
Peg. Peg, it's gone.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.269
Somebody stole my car.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.715
Don't be ridiculous, Al.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.639
Who would steal the Dodge?

02:59.480 --> 03:03.075
That would be like someone stealing
my engagement ring.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.914
Or one of Kelly's ideas.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.118
Or Bud.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.439
- Flip a burger.
- Flood a bed.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.788
I can't believe it.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.514
I lost my Dodge.
It's really, really gone.

03:20.720 --> 03:24.679
And it figures. Three weeks to the day
I wash the damn thing, it gets stolen.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.791
- Somebody call the police.
- What for?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.479
The call costs more than the car.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.312
And it costs more than the condom...

03:33.520 --> 03:35.954
...I should've used
the night you were conceived.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.429
Yes, 911.
Yes, this is an emergency.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.437
Put me on hold.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.433
Yes, yes, yes, officer.
Yes, I'm still here.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.592
Yes, I'll wait.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.796
Yes, I'm still here. Yes, I want
some of your best men on this job.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.673
The crime?
Someone stole my 1974 Dodge.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.757
Hello? Hello?

04:26.720 --> 04:28.790
Bribe-taking, doughnut-sucking,
trigger-happy-

04:29.000 --> 04:30.752
Hello, officer?

04:32.440 --> 04:36.831
Yes, officer.
Yes, I'd like to report a kidnapping.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.749
How tall? Oh, about...

04:39.960 --> 04:44.272
...4 feet tall, 5 feet wide...

04:44.480 --> 04:47.677
...smoke belching out the rear,
weighs about two tons.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.120
No, it's not Oprah.

04:53.800 --> 04:58.078
No, it's not Delta Burke. Who would call
to complain if she was missing?

04:58.280 --> 04:59.998
No. It's my Dodge.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.758
Hello?

05:03.320 --> 05:06.790
Run six red lights, they're all over you.
Where are they when you need them?

05:07.360 --> 05:09.874
<i>You know, Dad,
this reminds me of the old saying:</i>

05:10.080 --> 05:14.870
I was sad when I had no Dodge,
until I saw the man who had one.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.160
How did you grow up heartless
in this house?

05:20.200 --> 05:22.111
I'm gonna miss the old Dodge.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.231
I grew up in it. I went to school in it.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.793
I feel like I was born in it.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.392
Well, you certainly
were conceived in it.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.636
I remember when you used to
lock me in it...

05:32.840 --> 05:34.990
...because you couldn't find
a babysitter.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.633
Yeah, but, you know, pumpkin...

05:36.840 --> 05:40.992
...we always left the window open
just a little crack for you, didn't we?

05:41.200 --> 05:43.839
Just like we did with Buck.

05:44.080 --> 05:48.153
Al, you remember the time we tried
to outrun the cops in the Dodge?

05:48.360 --> 05:49.588
Yeah.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.554
But he eventually caught us, though.
He was pretty fast for a guy on foot.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.549
Oh, but it's not just the car,
it's the precious items that it held.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.994
My 8-track tape player.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.714
The last great
American sound system.

06:04.920 --> 06:09.630
That 8-track is to today's stereos
what a girlfriend is to a wife.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.593
An earlier, better version.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.277
Hey, look what we found
in the garbage.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.040
Milly Bell, my 8-track!

06:20.800 --> 06:24.588
We also found
your " Born To Be Wild" tape...

06:24.960 --> 06:27.190
<i>...Meet The Four Seasons...</i>

06:27.400 --> 06:29.197
<i>...Meet The Supremes...</i>

06:29.400 --> 06:32.836
<i>...and The Four Seasons
Meet The Supremes.</i>

06:33.520 --> 06:36.034
Well, now we know that this thief
is not only stupid...

06:36.240 --> 06:37.514
...but has no taste in music.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.188
Wait a second. Wait a second.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.676
I wonder where Michael Bolton was
this morning.

06:47.760 --> 06:51.673
If they don't arrest him for his singing,
they won't arrest him for this.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.719
So someone stole your Dodge,
eh, Al?

06:54.920 --> 06:56.353
Well, it's your own fault.

06:56.560 --> 07:00.553
You should know better than to leave it
parked out front on garbage day.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.118
Hey, I bet somebody took it
to start a new limousine service.

07:07.320 --> 07:11.472
You know, for those people who can't
quite afford the luxury of Greyhound.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.514
Or to use as a pace car
for the Garbage Man 500.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.953
You know, Marcie,
how can you be so unfeeling?

07:21.160 --> 07:22.388
Didn't you ever get up...

07:22.600 --> 07:25.751
...and suddenly realize that something
very, very important was gone?

07:25.960 --> 07:29.919
Sure you do. You must every morning
when you open up your pyjama top.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.834
Or your pyjama bottoms.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.470
Yeah, right.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.519
Peg, set her straight.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.836
So there.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.992
Now, I'm gonna have to notify
the insurance company.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.713
They're not gonna be too happy...

07:58.920 --> 08:01.070
...because this baby's gonna be
hard to replace.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.631
Fifty dollars?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.036
For a Dodge?

08:07.120 --> 08:09.918
<i>That car was a classic.
Why, everything in there was original:</i>

08:10.120 --> 08:12.793
The seats, the engine, the oil.

08:14.120 --> 08:17.430
And what about my mental suffering,
huh? How much is that worth?

08:17.640 --> 08:20.677
Oh, you say that's the major part
of the $50.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.038
All right, let me think about it.
I'll get back to you.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.717
Fifty dollars.
You can't replace a car for $50.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.876
The worst part is
just five more payments...

08:30.080 --> 08:32.469
...and the damn thing was mine!

08:34.280 --> 08:35.712
Hey, hey look, Daddy.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.832
We could get a Mercedes
for just 50 K's.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.155
You don't even need money.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.673
I have some spare K's
from those letters from school...

08:45.880 --> 08:48.474
...saying that Kelly is an idiot.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.109
Well, who's the idiot now, huh?

08:56.800 --> 08:58.756
Peg.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.395
That's great news, honey.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.512
Why don't you run up
and get those K's?

09:06.400 --> 09:08.072
You betcha.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.033
Bud, you can help too.
You can get one out of the paper...

09:11.240 --> 09:15.518
...because there's always one in there
about President Clinton and their cat.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.755
And the current controversy
over campaign contributions.

09:22.960 --> 09:26.669
Wow, that's
a veritable cornucopia of K's.

09:29.600 --> 09:33.559
Look, Al. Al, you're not gonna settle
for 50 bucks, are you?

09:33.760 --> 09:36.911
They pay you
for what's in the car as well.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.680
Now, what did you have in the trunk?

09:40.080 --> 09:44.915
I had parts of a carburettor
I had left over when I took it apart.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.553
Had a salami that I was aging.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.910
No, Al.
You tell them that you had jewellery.

09:55.120 --> 09:58.556
Paintings. Cash.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.149
And a salami.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.710
Follow me, Al.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.039
Two salamis.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.674
I think I'm starting to get your drift.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.910
I think I had a loaf of bread
in there too.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.875
But how am I gonna prove
I had all that stuff?

10:31.080 --> 10:32.638
Well, how can they
prove you didn't?

10:33.520 --> 10:37.035
Dad, this is kind of illegal.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.631
Oh, gee, that's right.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.673
Guess I should rethink
the whole thing.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.395
Little sissy.

10:53.280 --> 10:56.556
Well, I mean, insurance companies
have been ripping us off for years.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.320
Maybe we should get
our fair share, right?

11:06.360 --> 11:08.635
I'm back in, eh, Dad?

11:11.960 --> 11:13.598
You could really use the money, Al.

11:13.800 --> 11:18.590
It should be your choice to walk around
with green teeth and yellow underwear.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.598
Or sometimes vice versa.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.159
You're right!

11:23.360 --> 11:25.828
Now, I'm gonna make a list.
Peg, make a list.

11:26.840 --> 11:31.038
How am I gonna tell this insurance guy
that I forgot to say I had all that stuff?

11:31.280 --> 11:32.872
Tell him you had a lot on your mind.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.719
How would they know
it's as empty as your trunk?

11:36.800 --> 11:39.712
You're right.
He doesn't know I'm an idiot.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.471
What am I gonna do for a car?

11:43.720 --> 11:45.039
Marcie...

11:45.240 --> 11:47.913
...I saw you had a third car out front.
Can I borrow it?

11:48.160 --> 11:51.994
Well, actually, I borrowed it. I've been
thinking about getting a new car.

11:52.200 --> 11:56.512
Dealerships are so desperate, they'll
let you try one out for a couple of days.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.315
Gee, I'd like to do that...

12:00.520 --> 12:04.513
...but I don't have the money to buy
a new car. And, of course, if I lied...

12:04.720 --> 12:08.110
...then that would be cheating.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.670
And we couldn't do that, could we?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.870
That was good, right, Dad?

12:32.120 --> 12:36.352
Pardon me.
Have you any Grey Poupon?

12:57.960 --> 13:02.192
Hey, Kel, why are you watching
Spanish television?

13:05.800 --> 13:07.552
Spanish?

13:08.720 --> 13:11.678
I just thought they were English words
I didn't know.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.834
Hey, don't sit on my K's.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.111
I have 28 K's.

13:25.320 --> 13:29.359
Now, I could probably get a Jeep,
but I have my heart set on a Mercedes.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.155
So, what options
do you think I should get?

13:36.520 --> 13:39.557
Maybe one of those
electronic brains.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.189
Because something in the car
should have one.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.755
- Who's Mom talking to?
- Oh, the insurance company.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.997
She's taking care of things.
She was afraid Dad would go too far.

13:49.240 --> 13:54.109
Yes, I realize it takes time
to authenticate the Stradivarius.

13:55.600 --> 13:59.195
That's why I just don't know why
you don't take our word for it.

14:00.520 --> 14:03.432
Yes, we are the same Bundys
that filed a claim...

14:03.640 --> 14:07.599
...that our mansion had been
whisked away in Hurricane Andrew.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.350
But I don't know what business
that is of yours.

14:10.560 --> 14:15.111
That was an entirely different insurance
company we were trying to defraud.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.675
Anyway, my husband
has empowered me...

14:18.880 --> 14:22.111
...to come down off our original figure
of 6 million.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.790
Yes. That's because
we found the Picasso.

14:26.600 --> 14:31.116
It turns out it wasn't in the car at all,
it just fell into the hamper.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.591
Liar?

14:34.800 --> 14:39.157
You know, no one has ever
called me that in all my 24 years.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.997
Oh, come on.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.953
It's not like it's your money.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.157
Hello?

14:49.160 --> 14:52.789
Boy, you file
one multimillion-dollar claim...

14:53.000 --> 14:57.278
...and all that "good neighbour" crap
just flies out the window.

15:11.960 --> 15:15.350
Wow, Daddy,
you look good enough to bury.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.950
Yeah, Al, you really look great.

15:19.160 --> 15:22.835
You know, I'd marry you all over again
if I didn't know it was you.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.195
But of course I do, so I wouldn't.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.114
Where did you get that suit?

15:29.640 --> 15:32.234
When the guys at the store
saw me pull up in my new car...

15:32.440 --> 15:34.795
...they automatically opened
a charge account for me.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.436
I guess they didn't know I was coming
in to bum a nickel for the meter.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.751
Listen, honey, I'm having a little
trouble with the insurance company.

15:42.960 --> 15:46.430
<i>Did you know that the French claim
that the real Mona Lisa is theirs...</i>

15:46.640 --> 15:47.993
...just like we did?

15:48.600 --> 15:50.397
Well, you know, it's a dark day...

15:50.600 --> 15:53.797
...when someone will believe
the French over me.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.988
That picture of the dogs playing poker,
did they say they have that one too?

15:58.200 --> 16:00.555
Because I really did have that
in my trunk.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.836
Daddy, can we take a ride
in the new Mercedes?

16:03.040 --> 16:05.679
Well, pumpkin, I don't have
the new Mercedes anymore.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.235
See, when I took it back
to ask for a free fill-up...

16:08.440 --> 16:11.512
...they had the nerve to ask me
when I was gonna buy the damn thing.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.518
Like I'd buy a foreign car.

16:19.720 --> 16:20.948
I'm an American.

16:21.160 --> 16:24.232
And if I'm gonna cheat somebody,
it'll be an American company.

16:24.760 --> 16:28.275
Now, who wants to go for a ride
with me in my new loaner?

16:28.480 --> 16:30.232
A Lincoln Town Car.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.789
- I do. I do.
- I do. I do.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.640
Then let's rock 'n' roll.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.717
Gee, that was a great ride, eh, guys?

17:43.920 --> 17:45.512
<i>And it proves one thing for sure:</i>

17:45.720 --> 17:48.996
Old people can really jump out
of the way when there's 4000 pounds...

17:49.200 --> 17:52.988
...of American engineering
barrelling right at them.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.834
Hey, everybody,
our food's still hot...

17:59.040 --> 18:02.555
...and so is that guy
at the Burger Boy drive-up window.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.918
The fool actually handed me the bag
while I still had the $5...

18:06.120 --> 18:08.429
...dangling in front of the window.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.472
Oh, look, Bud, it looks like your bed.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.589
Look, Kel.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.268
This will fit your finger
when you're 30.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.517
Now, Bud,
I have told you a thousand times...

18:26.720 --> 18:29.518
...don't play with your food
or I'm gonna give it to the dog.

18:29.720 --> 18:33.156
And if the dog plays with it,
I'm gonna give it to your father.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.155
Hello, ma'am.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.472
Joe Orton from Uninsurable "We'll
Insure Anybody" Insurance Company.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.079
I've come to settle your claim.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.830
- It's our 5 million dollars.
- Yeah.

18:44.120 --> 18:47.795
<i>Well, I see why you kept the Mona Lisa
in the trunk.</i>

18:48.920 --> 18:50.592
And my salami.

18:50.800 --> 18:55.032
Oh, I mean, my two salamis.
How much money you gonna give me?

18:55.680 --> 18:58.911
We'll give you $25,000.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.318
Just wait one second, please.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.038
Family meeting.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.550
What are we meeting for?
Let's take the 25,000.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.830
Wait a minute, Al.
That's not how it's done.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.679
This is just their starting offer.
Go bargain with him.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.474
No. We don't want Dad to negotiate.
He's a moron.

19:20.680 --> 19:23.478
I am. I am.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.910
I am a moron.
Damn, what should I do?

19:26.120 --> 19:27.519
<i>Just remember the old saying:</i>

19:27.720 --> 19:31.190
A bird in the hand
is worth a foot in the tush.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.872
What are you saying?

19:35.080 --> 19:36.798
I don't know.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.272
- What should I do?
- Negotiate.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.948
- Take the money.
- Buy a vowel.

19:45.680 --> 19:49.992
Look, Al, whatever your instincts are,
just do the opposite.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.873
Can I buy a vowel?
No, I mean- I'll take the money.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.749
Good news, Mr. Bundy.

20:02.680 --> 20:05.513
They're making
edible nightsticks now?

20:07.040 --> 20:08.268
I wish.

20:08.480 --> 20:11.790
No. I meant good news for you.
We found your Dodge.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.831
It was parked around the corner
where the engine fell out.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.479
We might have found it earlier...

20:21.680 --> 20:24.717
...but we barely care
when there's a major crime.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.951
Did they jimmy open the trunk,
officer?

20:27.200 --> 20:29.350
- Nope.
- What a relief.

20:29.560 --> 20:32.279
<i>The Mona Lisa is safe.</i>

20:35.960 --> 20:39.475
Well, I gotta be going too.
There's an armed robbery in progress...

20:39.680 --> 20:42.752
...and I'm gonna go park
under the freeway and take a nap.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.596
Wait, Daddy,
there might be some K's in there.

20:58.640 --> 21:02.189
Pumpkin, there are no K's in " broke. "

21:05.480 --> 21:06.913
But you know what?

21:07.120 --> 21:09.680
I'll tell you something.
I'm glad they found my Dodge...

21:09.880 --> 21:13.031
...because that's my car,
and I hate change.

21:13.280 --> 21:16.829
Well, you know,
it would be like losing one of you guys.

21:17.040 --> 21:20.112
Or, Peg, it'd be like trading you in
on a brand-new blond...

21:20.320 --> 21:24.438
...with shiny, new, smooth,
factory-warranted hooters, you know.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.590
Sure, the first few rides would be nice
and everything, but, you know...

21:28.800 --> 21:33.237
...in the long run- And this, Peg,
is what depresses me every day.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.431
I realize...

21:36.560 --> 21:38.551
...that you're the one I want.

21:40.560 --> 21:44.553
- Oh, Al.
- I wish you wouldn't touch me that way.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.676
Kids, let's say we jump
in the old Dodge and go for a spin.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.029
- Okay.
- Let's go.

22:26.760 --> 22:29.832
Hello?
Yes, I saw your ad in the paper...

22:30.040 --> 22:33.953
...and I'd like to buy a Mercedes
and I just wanna verify the price.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.197
How much for the new model
with everything?

22:38.440 --> 22:40.556
Fifty G's?

22:47.920 --> 22:50.992
Well, I don't have that kind of letter.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.200
Or 50 big ones.

22:57.360 --> 22:59.749
How big do they have to be?

23:00.305 --> 23:06.544
