is pretty spotty.

I got the idea watching a

05:26.326 --> 05:30.962
There was this movie
all about these scientists
that used old dinosaur DNA

05:30.997 --> 05:33.732
to fill a theme park
with dinosaurs.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.967
Being from the future,
I know, of course,

05:36.002 --> 05:38.837
that would never work.
It's ludicrous!

travel back in time

05:42.842 --> 05:46.311
