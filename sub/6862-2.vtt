WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:03.371
Lemon, I cannot marry you.

00:03.404 --> 00:04.772
Not when a part of me
is in love with someone else.

00:04.805 --> 00:06.374
Last night, when George was
calling off the wedding,

00:06.407 --> 00:07.041
I was kind of having
sex with Wade.

00:07.075 --> 00:07.541
This doesn't mean anything.

00:07.575 --> 00:08.509
I don't really care.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.777
BRICK:
How are you?

00:09.810 --> 00:12.113
Determined to get a job,
move on with my life.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.082
There's a job opening here
if you want it.

00:14.115 --> 00:14.915
And what better way
to show the town of BlueBell

00:14.948 --> 00:16.384
that you are willing
to start over.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.086
I'm Ruby.
Why haven't
we met before?

00:18.119 --> 00:19.087
You know in high school,

00:19.120 --> 00:19.987
you had me wrapped
around your little finger.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.490
I decided to stick
around for a while.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.093
You don't know who you are
without Lemon.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.527
You're asking me
to date other people?

00:26.560 --> 00:29.230
One day, you will
be single and healed.

00:29.263 --> 00:29.763
And so will I.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.338
Nope.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.407
Nope?

00:39.440 --> 00:40.741
That is never
happening again.

00:40.774 --> 00:44.578
Never, never,
never, never.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.815
Wow, Doc, that's one more
"never" than yesterday.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.550
You must, uh, really
mean it this time.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.219
I do.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.287
You can't quit now,

00:53.321 --> 00:55.289
not when you're finally
getting the hang of it.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.291
I am not finally getting...

00:57.325 --> 00:58.559
(laughs)

00:58.592 --> 01:00.294
You know, never mind,
it doesn't matter,

01:00.328 --> 01:03.164
because that
is never happening again.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.165
Just help me find my pants.

01:04.197 --> 01:07.135
Uh, that pile.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.238
The...

01:10.271 --> 01:12.506
Ooh.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.475
Maybe you, uh,

01:14.508 --> 01:15.743
just need a soothing hug.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.248
Come on.

01:20.281 --> 01:23.184
Damn it.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.685
(knocking on door)
Wake up.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.591
(knocking)

01:30.624 --> 01:31.592
(Zoe gasps)

01:31.625 --> 01:32.760
Ow!

01:32.793 --> 01:35.796
Zoe?

01:35.829 --> 01:36.697
Is that you?

01:37.898 --> 01:40.834
Hey, Rose!

01:40.868 --> 01:42.470
What are you
doing up so early?

01:42.503 --> 01:44.305
Sleep in, why don't ya?

01:44.338 --> 01:45.306
You're a teenager.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.675
Where are your pants?

01:47.708 --> 01:50.278
Oh, nowhere.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.846
I was, uh, running.

01:52.880 --> 01:53.847
Pantless.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.649
In heels, it's a new thing.

01:55.683 --> 01:56.750
People are doing it.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.119
I'm a doctor,
have to keep up.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.191
Rose, look at me!

02:03.224 --> 02:04.292
Exercise is so important.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.527
Come inside.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.597
ROSE:
Okay, so you remember

02:09.630 --> 02:11.865
how I finally found
my niche in high school?

02:11.899 --> 02:13.167
Ironic Japanese anime girl?

02:13.201 --> 02:14.168
After that.

02:14.202 --> 02:15.203
Indie rock girl?

02:15.236 --> 02:16.504
Right.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.272
Well, guess who's going
to the Black Keys concert

02:18.306 --> 02:19.207
this weekend in Austin?

02:19.240 --> 02:20.874
You?

02:20.908 --> 02:22.543
Rose, that is so exciting!

02:22.576 --> 02:23.944
No, if it was me,

02:23.977 --> 02:26.947
I would've gone,
"Oh, my God, guess who's going

02:26.980 --> 02:28.316
"to the Black Keys concert
this weekend in Austin?"

02:28.349 --> 02:29.550
Like that.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.352
No, Sara Lynn Willoughby.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.654
And when she walks into school
on Monday wearing that T-shirt,

02:33.687 --> 02:36.224
I'll be back to eating lunch
at the table by the Dumpster.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.258
Please, you have to help me.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.293
Okay, how?

02:39.327 --> 02:40.761
Just diagnose me with liver
failure and medevac me

02:40.794 --> 02:42.230
to Austin for a transplant.

02:42.263 --> 02:45.799
Oh, man, you know
I totally would,

02:45.833 --> 02:47.701
if it weren't wrong
in every possible way.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.537
Don't try to copy
Sara Lynn Willoughby,

02:49.570 --> 02:51.272
that is the opposite
of "indie."

02:51.305 --> 02:54.275
Be Rose, the best you
that you can be.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.743
Like you with your
pantsless running?

02:55.776 --> 02:58.178
There are health benefits, okay?

02:59.913 --> 03:01.949
MAGNOLIA:
 You're turning me into a liar.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.351
And how is that?

03:03.384 --> 03:04.485
People ask me,

03:04.518 --> 03:07.688
"Is your sister really a
waitress at the Rammer Jammer?"

03:07.721 --> 03:10.291
And I say no.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.659
Don't you ever think
about anyone but yourself?

03:11.692 --> 03:14.295
Magnolia Breeland, there is
no shame in honest work.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.829
I am an independent woman,

03:15.863 --> 03:18.299
working to save money to
move out of my father's house

03:18.332 --> 03:20.234
and into my own apartment.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.569
It's an inspiring
story actually.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.437
Hey, good morning, girls.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.572
Good morning.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.307
Daddy, please make
Lemon quit her job!

03:26.340 --> 03:29.843
Just give her money so our
family is not a laughingstock.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.345
Oh, no, no, no,
I have learned my lesson,

03:31.379 --> 03:32.980
I am not just
giving you girls money

03:33.013 --> 03:35.316
and smoothing your way anymore.

03:35.349 --> 03:38.419
It is not good for anyone.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.455
Oh, my God, see
what you've done?

03:41.489 --> 03:42.990
(groans)

03:43.023 --> 03:44.358
Thank you, Daddy.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.593
Not at all.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.860
Hey, you're doing
honest hard work.

03:46.894 --> 03:47.995
Good for you.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.564
You know, I just remembered.

03:50.598 --> 03:53.033
You know, with Addy enrolling
in graduate school in Mobile,

03:53.066 --> 03:54.902
I'm gonna be needing
a new receptionist.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.904
You know, that job,

03:56.937 --> 04:01.342
it's got medical benefits, and a
401K, and a nice, comfy chair...

04:01.375 --> 04:04.478
Thank you, but working for my
daddy is not that far removed

04:04.512 --> 04:05.679
from being taken care of
by my daddy, now is it?

04:05.713 --> 04:09.550
Oh, no, I was just thinking
about the wording for an ad.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.351
Mm-hmm.

04:16.524 --> 04:17.791
Thank you, ma'am.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.827
Hey, stranger.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.295
I haven't seen you all week.

04:21.329 --> 04:24.298
Well, yeah, you know,
it's a big town.

04:24.332 --> 04:26.767
Oh, yes, it's so big.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.069
So easy to hide in.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.506
Well, hey, hey, Lavon Hayes
hides from no one.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.842
You know, I've just been,
uh, busy running things.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.810
Oh, you've been running,
all right.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.379
But don't, okay?

04:38.412 --> 04:39.447
Nothing to be afraid of here.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.617
Hey, guys.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.619
Hey, Zoe.
Hey, guys.
Coffee?

04:45.653 --> 04:47.355
Hey, thanks so much
for the movie last night.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.356
So fun.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.623
Thank you.

04:49.657 --> 04:50.624
Lavon won't watch Kate
Hudson movies with me.

04:50.658 --> 04:54.094
To which I partly credit
my robust mental health.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.863
Mmm, well, I got to go.

04:55.896 --> 04:56.997
I'll, uh, call you later?

04:57.030 --> 04:57.998
Okay.
'Kay.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.833
Mayor Hayes.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.070
Thank you.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.072
She is so cool.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.575
I agree.

05:07.608 --> 05:08.576
She's up to something.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.110
You're still on this?

05:10.143 --> 05:12.079
Ruby is in town
to visit family,

05:12.112 --> 05:13.914
not boil your bunny
because a long ago,

05:13.947 --> 05:15.749
you were too chicken
to break up with her.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.018
You've apologized,
she forgave you.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.019
Done.

05:19.052 --> 05:22.623
Ah, no, no, no.

05:22.656 --> 05:26.460
I apologized,
she accepted, yes.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.462
But she did not forgive me.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.398
Hmm, what do you
say to that?

05:30.431 --> 05:33.501
That you might have
exaggerated your mental health.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.403
Says the woman perched
atop a love triangle.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.971
Hey, I told you,
not anymore.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.373
I made a choice.

05:39.407 --> 05:40.408
I chose me.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.842
Everything is under control.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.712
I can't be a rebound,
so I won't be with George

05:44.745 --> 05:46.447
until he gets out there
and sows his wild oats.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.816
So, you're really gonna be okay

05:48.849 --> 05:50.418
if he starts to have
sex with someone else?

05:50.451 --> 05:52.085
Whoa, hey, now.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.722
Sex is a long time away.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.123
George's heart needs to heal.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.091
Okay.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.994
And meanwhile, you just keep
getting freaky with Wade.

06:01.028 --> 06:01.829
What?

06:01.862 --> 06:03.130
No, I totally stopped
doing that.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.865
Since when?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.434
Recently.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.435
Like an hour ago.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.902
See? Under control.

06:11.472 --> 06:12.873
Here you go, everyone.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.175
Oh, elbows
off the table, please.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.610
And, sir, if the sun
gets too bright in here,

06:16.644 --> 06:19.146
feel free to wear
your hat indoors.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.714
If not, let's take it off, okay?

06:20.748 --> 06:23.116
Enjoy.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.985
You gotta fire her.

06:25.018 --> 06:25.986
No, she's...

06:26.019 --> 06:29.423
She's not that bad.

06:29.457 --> 06:30.357
She's the worst waitress
we ever had

06:30.390 --> 06:31.859
and we've never been
known for our service.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.160
I'm bussing all her tables

06:33.193 --> 06:36.129
'cause she refuses
to touch half-chewed food!

06:36.163 --> 06:37.698
See?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.099
Take care of it.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.100
No way.
Not happening.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.169
WALLY:
What, you afraid of her?

06:42.202 --> 06:43.871
Yeah.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.946
Casual day at the law firm?

06:52.980 --> 06:56.750
No, I'm just, uh,
just going fishing.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.051
Good.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.487
I mean, if you like fishing.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.488
And it makes you happy.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.489
Are you happy?

07:01.522 --> 07:02.923
Because I want you to be happy.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.492
And I know I threw
a lot at you last week.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.893
Oh, wait, wait.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.094
You're talking
about when you told me

07:07.127 --> 07:08.095
that you want me
to date other people

07:08.128 --> 07:09.930
instead of you, right?

07:09.963 --> 07:11.064
Yup, that was it then.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.034
Yeah, uh...

07:14.067 --> 07:16.236
That...

07:16.269 --> 07:18.572
I'm still not happy about.

07:18.606 --> 07:22.075
And I'm sorry, you know, it's
that you just got out of a...

07:22.109 --> 07:24.512
15 year relationship,
I know, I was there.

07:28.248 --> 07:32.553
Zoe, I am, uh, not giving
up on the two of us.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.121
See, I'm still hoping that
we'll be together someday,

07:34.154 --> 07:37.257
so I'm just gonna take
this time I got here

07:37.290 --> 07:38.892
and I'm gonna become
the best version of myself

07:38.926 --> 07:43.831
that I possibly can be
because well, you deserve that.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.567
Yes.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.901
So do you.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.005
ZOE:
 I'm bad.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.007
Bad, bad, bad.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.209
You having sex
with Wade isn't bad.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.678
WADE:
Not bad?

07:57.711 --> 07:58.846
I've heard
it's freaking awesome.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.514
Ha, hardly.

08:00.548 --> 08:03.751
And it doesn't even matter
because never again.

08:03.784 --> 08:06.754
Oops, aren't you, uh,

08:06.787 --> 08:09.189
aren't you supposed to say
that after we do it?

08:09.222 --> 08:10.257
ZOE:
No more, Wade.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.692
Lavon, tell him.

08:11.725 --> 08:12.893
Me?

08:12.926 --> 08:14.795
No, no, I-I'm way out of this.

08:14.828 --> 08:15.896
This is y'all.

08:15.929 --> 08:16.864
ZOE: Oh, come on,
you're the landlord.

08:16.897 --> 08:20.167
You can make a rule,
no sex between tenants.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.769
I could make one,
no coming in my kitchen

08:21.802 --> 08:23.704
without knocking, too,
but I doubt anyone would listen.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.940
This wouldn't, uh, happen to be
about George Tucker, would it?

08:26.974 --> 08:28.041
No.

08:28.075 --> 08:31.912
This is about being the best
version of me I can be.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.214
I told Rose to be
her best self.

08:34.246 --> 08:36.884
George is trying
to be his best self.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.251
And sleeping with someone
that I don't even like

08:39.285 --> 08:42.690
is hardly me being mine.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.224
Problem is, Doc, you're hooked.

08:44.256 --> 08:45.192
Oh, I am not hooked.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.294
Yeah, you are.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.096
You try to quit on your own,

08:49.129 --> 08:51.198
I'll bet you $50 we have
sex within the next 48 hours.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.200
$50?
Mmm.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.068
Why don't we make it a 100?

08:55.102 --> 08:56.069
Shake on it.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.174
Out!

09:01.208 --> 09:03.110
(Wade laughs)

09:03.143 --> 09:05.846
Two days without you is easy.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.615
I have gone way
longer than that

09:07.648 --> 09:09.016
without sex.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.684
I have gone years.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.287
Yeah.

09:14.321 --> 09:15.856
That may be part
of the problem.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.328
(car horn honks)

09:21.361 --> 09:23.664
(seagulls calling)

09:23.697 --> 09:25.265
(birds singing)

09:34.708 --> 09:36.243
JEFFRIES:
Oh, there he is!

09:36.276 --> 09:37.778
There he is now!

09:37.811 --> 09:39.312
Hey, Grandpop, please, okay?

09:39.346 --> 09:41.314
What's going on, y'all?

09:41.348 --> 09:45.218
Ruby here has just informed us
that Southern Living magazine

09:45.252 --> 09:47.821
has dropped BlueBell
from their list

09:47.855 --> 09:49.322
of the top 100 Southern towns.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.323
Mm-hmm.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.692
They what now?

09:51.725 --> 09:53.360
The editor is a friend
of mine...

09:53.393 --> 09:54.695
Yeah.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.329
...so she just
gave me the heads-up.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.065
It's what we get for electing
a linebacker to run things.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.366
Especially one who let Auburn

09:59.399 --> 10:00.600
score the winning
touchdown off him.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.704
I was clipped on that play,
now the replay was very clear.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.405
What if the tourists don't come?

10:05.438 --> 10:08.108
Who'll buy my toaster cozies?

10:08.141 --> 10:09.242
No, no, now.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.744
The tourism is just fine, okay?

10:10.778 --> 10:13.246
Just today, a-a women's
pro-beach volleyball team

10:13.280 --> 10:15.115
is stopping here
on their way to Daytona.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.383
Daytona, exactly.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.251
More business slipping
through your fingers

10:18.285 --> 10:19.286
like an Auburn running back!

10:19.319 --> 10:21.021
I have been silent long enough!

10:21.054 --> 10:23.657
Grandpa, when have you ever
been silent for five minutes?

10:23.691 --> 10:24.892
No, there is an
election coming up,

10:24.925 --> 10:27.060
and I intend to run
against Mayor Hayes,

10:27.094 --> 10:28.862
and I intend to win!

10:28.896 --> 10:30.731
Okay, Grandpa.
Hmm.

10:30.764 --> 10:31.832
Let's go get some breakfast,
okay?

10:31.865 --> 10:33.166
Let's get you
something to eat.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.102
I was blocked
in the back.
Yeah, yeah.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.177
(gasps)

10:55.188 --> 10:57.758
Good morning, George.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.026
Table for one?

10:59.059 --> 11:02.462
Lemon, I heard
you got a job here.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.431
I tried to stay away.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.433
But there's only two
restaurants in town

11:06.466 --> 11:08.301
and, well, Fancie's doesn't
serve breakfast, so...

11:08.335 --> 11:09.903
Don't be absurd, George.

11:09.937 --> 11:12.439
We're both two working
adult professionals.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.274
We can occupy the same
space and be civil.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.109
Why don't you
just, um, go ahead

11:16.143 --> 11:17.945
and take a seat
anywhere you'd like.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.280
If you'll excuse me, I have
to go marry the ketchups.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.950
Maybe they'll go
through with it.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.396
Hey.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.966
Hey yourself.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.901
You know, uh,

11:40.934 --> 11:43.971
last time I saw you, I think
I had my fist in your face.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.206
Yeah, yeah, you know, that was
right around the same time

11:46.239 --> 11:47.975
I was body slamming you
through a table.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.846
Good times.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.147
(laughs)
Yeah, it was.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.820
(whistles)

11:59.853 --> 12:01.855
So, I see you hired
my ex-fiancée.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.124
I did.

12:04.157 --> 12:08.028
Hey, uh, wonder if you
might have any advice

12:08.061 --> 12:11.098
I can give to Wally
on how to fire her?

12:11.131 --> 12:12.399
Yeah.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.367
Yeah, I do.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.368
Don't.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.805
I thought so.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.139
All right.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.445
Ruby didn't have to blindside me
with that Southern Living news.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.214
No, she could
have told me first.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.381
She is up to something.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.083
Look, stop being crazy.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.820
Just ask her if she has
an evil plot to destroy you.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.087
Says my reasonable
friend who's

12:34.121 --> 12:34.922
on her second bag
of marshmallows.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.457
Hey, it takes a lot
of marshmallows

12:37.490 --> 12:39.960
to get any nutritional value.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.262
Plus, it's almost been 24 hours
since I had sex with Wade.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.463
It's either this or smoking.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.198
Zoe, there you are.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.499
Hi.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.868
I took your advice.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.036
Smart girl like you
should know better.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.404
Like you said,

12:51.438 --> 12:53.440
anyone can go
to a rock concert.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.343
But it takes a really hip,
plugged-in person to throw one.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.548
BlueBellapalooza.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.417
Mumford & Sons, Pink,

13:04.451 --> 13:06.286
Arcade Fire,
Talking Heads Reunion?

13:06.319 --> 13:08.889
This is quite the lineup.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.423
Well, that's what being
plugged-in is all about.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.392
And are you plugged-in?

13:12.425 --> 13:14.394
No, but your mom is.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.429
You said she's worked
with tons of music people.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.165
If she can help me get
just one of these bands.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.901
Rose.
I know, but it has
to be this weekend,

13:20.934 --> 13:22.435
before Sara Lynn Willoughby
gets back

13:22.469 --> 13:24.271
with her stupid
Black Keys T-shirt.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.474
I guess I can ask my mom,

13:27.507 --> 13:29.176
but that is all
that I can do.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.443
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.179
You're welcome.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.914
Because it kind
of was your idea.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.215
Hey, I said I'd ask.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.484
Hi, Virgil, how you doing?

13:37.517 --> 13:38.485
Good to see you.

13:38.518 --> 13:39.586
Come on with me.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.488
Get you right in here now.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.389
Daddy?

13:42.422 --> 13:44.491
Hold on one second,
just have a seat.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.094
I got your message.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.863
What was so important that you
needed to talk to me in person?

13:49.897 --> 13:51.264
I'll be right back,
I have to quickly drain poor

13:51.298 --> 13:52.933
Mr. Hanson's abscess
before it bursts.

13:52.966 --> 13:53.934
Sure, go, go, go.

13:53.967 --> 13:54.935
(phone rings)

13:54.968 --> 13:55.936
Would you get that, honey?

13:55.969 --> 13:56.970
I'm the only one
here today.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.405
Certainly, go, go.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.278
Dr. Breeland's office.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.218
Yes, could you
call back, please?

14:11.251 --> 14:14.321
Thank you so much.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.889
Daddy?

14:17.490 --> 14:18.658
Listen, according
to your calendar,

14:18.691 --> 14:21.128
Mr. Hanson's only here for his
blood pressure medication.

14:21.161 --> 14:25.098
Whoa, hey, good catch.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.400
You're good at this.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.136
Daddy!

14:31.004 --> 14:33.306
You set this up so I would
want Addy's job.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.042
I have a job, okay?

14:35.075 --> 14:36.509
I thought you said
that you were proud of me.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.444
Well, I'm not.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.246
(scoffs)

14:39.279 --> 14:42.582
I mean I'm proud of you, yes,
but you are degrading yourself

14:42.615 --> 14:44.484
to prove to me you're
an independent woman.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.254
I am a great waitress.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.521
And I'm sorry that you're
not thrilled about it,

14:48.555 --> 14:50.123
but I'm not thrilled about you
tongue kissing your girlfriend

14:50.157 --> 14:51.558
in the middle
of town square either.

14:51.591 --> 14:55.428
Okay, I was going to tell you
all about Emily...

14:55.462 --> 14:57.630
I'm happy for you, okay?

14:57.664 --> 14:59.666
I just wish that you
could be happy for me, too.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.469
I just think you are capable
of so much more, Lemonade.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.471
Tell you what,
why don't you and Emily

15:04.504 --> 15:07.607
come the Rammer Jammer
tonight for dinner?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.009
Watch me work.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.143
I mean, isn't this
your night off?

15:10.177 --> 15:11.644
I can pick up an extra shift.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.547
I can meet Emily and serve
you two a lovely meal.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.549
Well, you've served me
many meals.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.318
Yeah, well, this time
you have to tip.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.724
So how are you spending your
newfound freedom, my friend?

15:24.757 --> 15:27.427
Well,

15:27.460 --> 15:30.430
so far, a lot of fishing.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.266
Oh, all right, attaboy.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.535
Trolling the waters,
as they say.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.337
Yeah, just, uh,
waiting for a nibble.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.705
Reeling 'em in.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.640
And then gutting them
and throwing them on the fire.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.443
I hope you're talking
about actual fishing.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.178
I am.

15:45.212 --> 15:48.415
Man, you're single for the first
time since Clinton was president

15:48.448 --> 15:50.317
and you're spending
it alone on a boat.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.418
You should be naked
with strangers.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.552
Boat optional.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.588
I'm not really the-the one-night
stand type of person.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.724
How would you know,
you haven't given it a shot.

15:57.757 --> 16:01.661
Yeah, that's true, but...

16:01.694 --> 16:04.331
Look, even if I did, I don't
have those kind of moves.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.266
And besides, this is
a small town, okay?

16:06.299 --> 16:09.069
People talk and...

16:09.102 --> 16:12.172
Now Lemon works
at the only bar.

16:12.205 --> 16:16.076
Well, you are in luck,
my friend.

16:16.109 --> 16:19.512
Because Lemon is not
working tonight and I am.

16:19.546 --> 16:23.483
And there is a whole crew of
lady beach volleyball players

16:23.516 --> 16:24.517
passing through town.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.518
Can you say,

16:25.552 --> 16:27.520
bump, set and...

16:29.389 --> 16:31.091
You do the spike.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.392
What?

16:32.425 --> 16:34.494
You're the worst
student ever, okay?

16:34.527 --> 16:36.229
ZOE:
 Okay, Mom.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.331
Yeah, I understand.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.766
No, we just need someone.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.534
Didn't anyone say yes?

16:41.568 --> 16:43.770
Okay, Mom,
I'll call you later.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.673
Man, I really put the "lose"
in BlueBellapalooza.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.811
Hey, how about
Lily Anne Lonergan?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.413
Lily Anne Lonergan?

16:53.446 --> 16:56.249
She's indie, she's local,
she'd be perfect.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.417
Yeah.
Do you know her?

16:57.450 --> 16:59.286
No, but Wade does.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.455
He played in a band with her
before she hit it big solo.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.723
Oh, I forgot that.

17:03.756 --> 17:04.790
Oh, my God, yes!

17:04.824 --> 17:06.459
Could you ask
him to call her?

17:06.492 --> 17:08.795
I really don't think that I can.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.431
I think it's a better idea
if Lavon does, I think.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.267
Oh, that's where
your pants went.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.602
LAVON:
Surely you can, uh,

17:15.635 --> 17:18.505
ask the man a question
without falling into bed.

17:27.347 --> 17:31.518
Well, well, well, you caved
sooner than I expected.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.720
You're not winning the bet.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.722
I'm need a favor for Rose.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.590
She's planning
a music festival tomorrow

17:37.624 --> 17:39.126
and she needs a headliner.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.493
Would you ask
Lily Anne Lonergan?

17:40.527 --> 17:42.762
(chuckles)
Well, I would, um,

17:42.795 --> 17:44.697
but as it turns out,
Lily Anne hates my guts.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.266
I can't imagine why.
Hmm.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.400
Can't you just call her?

17:47.434 --> 17:49.702
I don't have her number anymore.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.671
Suppose I could show you
where she lives in Mobile,

17:51.704 --> 17:54.374
but you'd have to drive.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.410
What? My car's up on blocks,
see for yourself.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.646
You think if you can get
me in a car alone,

17:59.679 --> 18:01.848
I won't be able to resist
having sex with you?

18:01.881 --> 18:04.417
Oh, you see right
through me, Doc.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.585
Only if I look in your ears.

18:05.618 --> 18:06.686
Ooh!
Mm-hmm.

18:06.719 --> 18:07.687
See you in an hour.

18:07.720 --> 18:08.688
Wear a shirt.

18:08.721 --> 18:09.556
Bring a hundred bucks.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.299
No, no, it's okay if you
can't make it tonight.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.667
We'll just take
a rain check, all right?

18:20.700 --> 18:22.335
It's no big deal,
we'll just do it another night.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.403
Are you kidding, man?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.272
Next time BlueBell
has a bar full of out-of-town

18:25.305 --> 18:26.606
female professional athletes,

18:26.639 --> 18:28.341
you and I will
both be long dead.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.742
Stay the course.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.678
Wade, you're my wingman here

18:31.711 --> 18:34.481
and I am not even certified
in this type of plane.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.748
Look, you got something
to write with?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.284
(sighs)

18:37.317 --> 18:38.885
No. Just go ahead.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.621
All right, first,
find the, uh, girl in the corner

18:41.654 --> 18:42.722
who just broke up
with her boyfriend.

18:42.755 --> 18:45.492
She's mad and sad--
a good mix for poor decisions.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.627
Okay, and I know
this about her how?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.896
Uh, glass of Chardonnay,
purse on her lap.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.465
You go up to her,
insist on buying her a drink,

18:52.499 --> 18:54.801
then you press C-7 on the
jukebox and ask her to dance.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.636
Okay, wait a minute.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.439
So, your entire plan revolves
around a magic song?

18:59.472 --> 19:02.742
Yup, and when the song ends,
you grab her by the hand

19:02.775 --> 19:04.511
and then you're
gonna pull her close

19:04.544 --> 19:05.778
and you say,
"Let's get out of here."

19:05.812 --> 19:06.879
She will, bam.

19:06.913 --> 19:07.880
I got to go, all right?

19:07.914 --> 19:08.881
Wade?

19:08.915 --> 19:11.484
Whew!

19:11.518 --> 19:13.520
Well, hello there.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.222
Stop. You're helping me
get Lily Anne to perform.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.389
That's it.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.191
I'm helping you
getLily Anne.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.692
I'm not talking to her.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.567
Radio?

19:32.805 --> 19:34.807
ANNOUNCER: The markets were
up today on good news

19:34.841 --> 19:36.509
about the housing sector.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.578
I like to stay current.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.712
Huh.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.982
...the median price on new homes
saw a 1.4% monthly...

19:43.015 --> 19:44.584
*

19:47.820 --> 19:48.955
(sighs)

19:54.861 --> 19:57.564
I'm gonna pull
over right up here.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.599
You're the driver.

20:10.377 --> 20:11.911
(gasps)
Road trip! Woo-hoo!

20:11.944 --> 20:14.747
What the hell is
wrong with you?

20:14.781 --> 20:15.915
Can I ride shotgun?

20:15.948 --> 20:17.984
'Cause I get carsick in the back
and I just ate spaghetti.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.986
No.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.592
Lavon, for the record,
I'm not waiting to spring

20:25.625 --> 20:29.329
some kind of evil
trap on you.

20:29.362 --> 20:33.733
Well, you know,
the Southern Livi thing.

20:33.766 --> 20:37.003
Then there's the whole Sarge
running for mayor thing.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.005
Oh, please, Grandpa
can't run his dishwasher.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.607
He's not running for mayor.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.410
He's just still mad at you
for breaking my heart.

20:43.443 --> 20:47.380
Well, I wouldn't
blame you if you wanted

20:47.414 --> 20:48.948
to get revenge, too, you know.

20:48.981 --> 20:52.051
Lavon, that was
a long time ago.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.886
Can we be friends?

20:53.920 --> 20:57.790
That is how we started,
at the roller rink.

20:57.824 --> 20:58.625
(laughs)

20:58.658 --> 21:00.960
When you taught me
to skate backwards.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.563
Well, someone had to pull
your clumsy butt around.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.831
(sighs)

21:04.864 --> 21:06.399
I mean, tell me, honestly,

21:06.433 --> 21:08.368
how is it possible
that a future pro athlete

21:08.401 --> 21:10.002
can have such a bad
center of gravity?

21:10.036 --> 21:12.339
Check, please.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.873
(both laugh)

21:20.847 --> 21:22.315
I should've worn heels.

21:22.349 --> 21:23.816
I don't like feeling short.

21:23.850 --> 21:24.684
What are you doing here?

21:24.717 --> 21:26.018
It's supposed
to be your night off.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.487
Well, I could use
the extra shift,

21:27.520 --> 21:29.789
and you could use
the extra hand.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.825
Uh...

21:32.859 --> 21:35.995
I was gonna do this
tomorrow, but, uh,

21:36.028 --> 21:37.364
this didn't work out.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.765
What?

21:38.798 --> 21:39.899
Yeah.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.401
You're firing me?

21:41.434 --> 21:42.769
Yeah.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.771
Wally, look at me.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.905
No.

21:45.938 --> 21:48.441
Wally, look at me.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.081
You cannot fire me tonight.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.616
My father is coming
here on a date,

21:56.649 --> 21:58.551
and I have to show him
that I'm good at this.

21:58.585 --> 22:00.753
But you're not.
I'm sorry, Lemon,

22:00.787 --> 22:03.556
this just isn't
your line of work.

22:03.590 --> 22:04.924
I'll pay you not to.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.659
What?

22:06.693 --> 22:08.428
$50. Let me work tonight.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.629
$75.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.832
Or though, I'll have to work
tomorrow to make up for it.

22:12.865 --> 22:13.666
But by that math,

22:13.700 --> 22:16.436
you could be
working here forever.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.837
Oh, Wally. (giggles)

22:17.870 --> 22:19.872
Thank you, but I do have
other plans in life.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.626
GEORGE:
Chardonnay,

22:39.659 --> 22:41.360
purse on the lap. Go time.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.443
Hello.
Uh, may I buy you a drink?

22:59.045 --> 23:00.647
Right.

23:03.816 --> 23:06.018
I am a lawyer.

23:06.052 --> 23:09.789
Do I seem like
I'll need a lawyer?

23:09.822 --> 23:11.791
You know, it's hard to say.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.860
Night is young.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.628
So...

23:15.662 --> 23:16.529
(chuckles)

23:23.903 --> 23:25.772
All right. Uh, hey, Chester.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.907
Can I get another drink
for this lovely young lady?

23:27.940 --> 23:30.777
Uh, it should be coming up
on the right here.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.079
Good, 'cause I'm starting
to feel nauseous.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.814
(phone rings)

23:38.985 --> 23:40.920
Hey, man,
I can't help you put it on.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.789
You should have practiced
on a banana.

23:42.822 --> 23:43.923
I can't believe I'm saying this,

23:43.956 --> 23:45.592
but your plan
is actually working.

23:45.625 --> 23:46.959
However, I'm out of small talk,

23:46.993 --> 23:49.095
and your magic song
hasn't come on yet, so...

23:49.128 --> 23:50.797
Just wait for it, all right?

23:50.830 --> 23:52.932
C-7, works every time.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.734
All right, bye.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.805
Why is George Tucker
calling you?

23:58.838 --> 24:00.840
What's C-7?

24:00.873 --> 24:05.011
I'm coaching him
on, uh, a game of Battleship.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.813
Hopefully, this time

24:06.846 --> 24:08.548
he sinks those pesky submarines.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.019
All right, I was supposed
to be his wingman tonight,

24:13.052 --> 24:15.822
but I'm helping you with this,
so I'm talking him through it.

24:15.855 --> 24:16.956
Talking him through what?

24:16.989 --> 24:20.527
I'm talking him
through making a casual...

24:20.560 --> 24:22.862
friendship. Hmm?

24:22.895 --> 24:25.498
The kind that lasts till just
before breakfast tomorrow?

24:25.532 --> 24:26.633
What?

24:26.666 --> 24:27.867
He means a one-night stand.

24:27.900 --> 24:28.968
But George isn't
ready for that.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.737
His heart needs
time to heal.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.872
(laughs)
Oh, sweetie, trust me,

24:32.905 --> 24:34.674
his heart has nothing to do
with what's about to happen.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.745
What's the big deal?

24:38.778 --> 24:41.514
I thought you, uh,
didn't want to be with him.

24:41.548 --> 24:42.849
I don't.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.617
And I'm fine with it.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.729
GIRL: You know what I mean?
GEORGE: Yeah, I mean,

24:56.763 --> 24:57.997
I, uh...

24:58.030 --> 24:59.866
(song begins)
C-7.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.233
Huh?
Um...

25:01.267 --> 25:03.002
Oh, I love this song.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.003
Really?

25:05.838 --> 25:07.006
Wow.

25:07.039 --> 25:09.909
Uh, would you like to dance?

25:09.942 --> 25:11.678
Absolutely.

25:15.715 --> 25:16.883
Oh, uh...

25:16.916 --> 25:18.585
Nice move.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.252
Yeah, it-it's
crowded out there.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.988
We should dance
in the corner.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.990
Yeah?

25:24.023 --> 25:25.024
And here you go, Emily.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.626
Chicken gumbo for you

25:26.659 --> 25:27.960
and seafood gumbo
for you, Daddy.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.029
Thank you.
Let me know what you think.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.764
The chef often asks
for my suggestions,

25:31.798 --> 25:33.299
as do many
of the employees, so...

25:33.332 --> 25:36.869
Ooh, that is delicious,
honey, really.

25:36.903 --> 25:37.970
Thank you.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.138
This place is packed tonight

25:39.171 --> 25:40.973
with freakishly tall women.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.042
I know.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.777
Emily, are you all right?

25:44.811 --> 25:46.312
You're turning really red.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.181
I think I accidentally

25:49.215 --> 25:50.683
got the seafood gumbo is all.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.185
I'm a tiny bit allergic,

25:53.219 --> 25:56.823
and I seem to have left
my EpiPen in my room.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.925
Oh, my God.
Emily, I-I'm so sorry.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.893
Oh, no, no,
we have a few minutes

26:00.927 --> 26:02.328
before my throat closes up.

26:02.361 --> 26:03.362
(gasps)

26:03.395 --> 26:04.764
Gonna get you over to my office,

26:04.797 --> 26:07.099
and I can give you a shot.

26:16.008 --> 26:18.244
* You're the nose hair
of humanity *

26:18.277 --> 26:20.980
* You ravaged me emotionally

26:21.013 --> 26:24.216
* I was blind but now I see

26:24.250 --> 26:26.352
* You disgust me,
you disgust me *

26:26.385 --> 26:28.154
* You disgust me, whoa-oh-oh

26:28.187 --> 26:29.989
* Oh-oh-oh.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.157
(giggles)

26:31.190 --> 26:33.159
Thanks.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.695
I felt really inspired
when I wrote that.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.163
Really, really inspired.

26:37.196 --> 26:41.100
Well, I forgot how beautiful
your voice is, Lily Anne.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.102
I also forgot that you were
a crazy nut job.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.771
Wade! He didn't mean that.

26:44.804 --> 26:47.039
I miss one little show,
and you up and quit the band.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.041
That show was
my sister's wedding!

26:49.075 --> 26:51.010
Who are you, his girlfriend?

26:51.043 --> 26:52.111
Run.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.412
Run from Wade.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.648
You can hear further
instructions in my song,

26:55.682 --> 26:56.883
"Run from Wade."

26:56.916 --> 26:58.751
Wait, that was about me?

26:58.785 --> 27:00.052
(sighs)
I'm not... No.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.254
I'm his doctor.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.423
And we're here, actually,

27:04.456 --> 27:06.358
because Rose is putting on
a music festival tomorrow.

27:06.392 --> 27:08.060
And I'd really love it
if you'd perform.

27:08.094 --> 27:09.061
You're a doctor?

27:09.095 --> 27:12.699
Can I ask your medical opinion
on something?

27:14.433 --> 27:15.668
Yesterday,

27:15.702 --> 27:18.004
I had this really bad
acid reflux,

27:18.037 --> 27:19.906
and I'm worried
it could affect my voice.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.040
And here we go.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.075
Uh, in addition to being
a nut burger,

27:23.109 --> 27:24.677
she's also a
hypochondriac.

27:24.711 --> 27:26.278
Why does nothing
ever affect your voice?

27:26.312 --> 27:27.914
Um,

27:27.947 --> 27:30.116
reflux is caused by things
that we ingest,

27:30.149 --> 27:32.952
so have you made any changes
to your diet, any new drugs?

27:32.985 --> 27:36.122
I am on a new mood stabilizer.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.957
Hmm, you should consider
upping your dosage.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.126
I can take a look at
your medications, if you like.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.728
Let me go get them.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.402
So, you want to
get out of here?

27:50.436 --> 27:52.104
Yes.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.241
Just give me a second.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.409
Just don't-don't go anywhere.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.017
Hey.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.219
What are you doing here,
George?

28:07.253 --> 28:11.123
Pouring salt into the gaping
wound that is my life?

28:11.157 --> 28:13.059
Lemon, are you okay?

28:13.092 --> 28:14.761
No, I'm not okay.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.999
Listen, all I wanted to do
was prove to my father

28:20.032 --> 28:22.468
that I could take care
of myself.

28:22.501 --> 28:25.437
And then I poisoned
his girlfriend.

28:25.471 --> 28:27.874
(chuckles)

28:27.907 --> 28:29.375
Lemon,

28:29.408 --> 28:32.044
I think a big part of
finding out what we're good at

28:32.078 --> 28:36.082
is figuring out
what we're not, so...

28:36.115 --> 28:38.350
Good news.

28:38.384 --> 28:41.087
You can wipe waitress
right off the list.

28:41.120 --> 28:44.023
Just...

28:44.056 --> 28:45.925
(laughter)

28:48.861 --> 28:51.831
You were always good
at giving me perspective.

28:54.133 --> 28:57.103
I still hate you
for what you did to me.

28:57.136 --> 28:59.038
I know.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.107
And I hope that someday

29:01.140 --> 29:04.276
I can figure out a way
to make that up to you.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.151
Could you start by
busing up a few tables?

29:12.184 --> 29:13.986
I'm really backed up.

29:14.020 --> 29:14.987
Actually, Lemon, I, uh...

29:15.021 --> 29:17.123
Do not leave my side.

29:17.156 --> 29:19.826
I almost had a one-night
stand with that busboy.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.227
So clearly,

29:21.260 --> 29:22.929
I can't be trusted.

29:27.199 --> 29:29.035
(laughs)
That's it.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.538
It's funny.

29:32.571 --> 29:33.873
(chuckles)

29:33.906 --> 29:36.108
The whole time I
lived in BlueBell,

29:36.142 --> 29:40.012
I thought as soon as I
got out, I'd find myself.

29:40.046 --> 29:42.882
And here I am,
16 years later,

29:42.915 --> 29:45.217
and still just as lost.

29:45.251 --> 29:48.320
Like a fancy sailboat waiting
for the wind to whip up.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.158
You know, I can relate.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.225
Yeah,

29:53.259 --> 29:54.293
when I retired, I didn't know

29:54.326 --> 29:56.295
who I was without football.

29:56.328 --> 30:00.099
So, I moved back here
and bought the plantation

30:00.132 --> 30:04.170
and basically played video games
for four months.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.371
(laughs)

30:05.404 --> 30:08.340
Somebody suggested I run
for mayor.

30:08.374 --> 30:11.210
Then everybody did.

30:11.243 --> 30:14.013
Suddenly,
I was Mayor Lavon Hayes.

30:16.548 --> 30:20.152
I'm just saying, you know,
sometimes I feel...

30:20.186 --> 30:22.021
adrift...

30:22.054 --> 30:23.155
myself.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.493
Well, I, um...

30:27.526 --> 30:29.228
I better go.

30:29.261 --> 30:30.429
What?

30:30.462 --> 30:32.899
My grandpa has me on a curfew.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.000
I know, it's
humiliating, but...

30:36.068 --> 30:37.503
Good night, Lavon.

30:43.009 --> 30:46.145
Don't take these without food,
and if it happens again,

30:46.178 --> 30:47.213
just give me a call.

30:47.246 --> 30:48.948
LILY ANNE:
Thanks, I will.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.649
And I really do wish
I could help you guys out

30:50.682 --> 30:53.252
with your festival,
but my band's on hiatus.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.954
You could play
with your old band.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.190
Not a good idea.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.425
Too many memories.

30:59.458 --> 31:00.392
Yeah.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.295
One moment.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.536
Apologize to her
and she might sing tomorrow.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.939
Well, that's a big can
of worms, Doc.

31:12.972 --> 31:16.142
Don't you see she-she's
still got the hots for me.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.110
(phone chirps)

31:18.144 --> 31:19.645
From George?

31:19.678 --> 31:22.648
Look, you can relax, all right?

31:22.681 --> 31:24.016
He struck out.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.888
You know,
I think I will apologize.

31:32.658 --> 31:35.061
Yeah.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.162
Huh.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.432
Lily Anne.

31:44.703 --> 31:47.173
Playing with you

31:47.206 --> 31:50.209
was the best time of my life,

31:50.242 --> 31:52.144
and I screwed it up

31:52.178 --> 31:53.445
by being an idiot.

31:53.479 --> 31:56.682
So, maybe we could just forget

31:56.715 --> 31:59.651
what happened, and, uh,

31:59.685 --> 32:01.587
play together once more.

32:03.455 --> 32:04.423
For old time's sake.

32:04.456 --> 32:07.359
You have no idea

32:07.393 --> 32:09.695
how long I've waited just
to hear you say you're sorry.

32:15.334 --> 32:16.368
Okay.

32:16.402 --> 32:19.238
Oh, my God.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.506
I got to go tweet this.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.308
Suck it, Sara Lynn Willoughby.

32:22.341 --> 32:23.309
Aah!

32:23.342 --> 32:24.543
We have to go.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.412
We have a long drive
back to BlueBell.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.980
Good point.

32:28.014 --> 32:30.282
I hate driving
after a gig.

32:30.316 --> 32:31.550
Maybe I could stay

32:31.583 --> 32:33.185
tomorrow night with you, Wade.

32:33.219 --> 32:35.721
Yeah.

32:35.754 --> 32:37.323
Fine with you, Doc?

32:37.356 --> 32:39.425
Whatever.
Get in the car.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.093
All right.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.404
(door opens)

32:55.474 --> 32:57.176
Before you say anything,

32:57.209 --> 32:58.744
I spent the whole night
with Rose,

32:58.777 --> 33:01.480
setting up the square
for BlueBellapalooza.

33:01.513 --> 33:04.483
I did not have sex with Wade.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.252
Thank you.

33:06.285 --> 33:09.355
So, just 12 hours to go.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.756
Yep.

33:10.789 --> 33:14.360
And I imported a toy
to distract him,

33:14.393 --> 33:16.795
in the form
of Lily Anne Lonergan.

33:16.828 --> 33:20.099
So Wade won't be bothering
me for sex tonight.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.800
Booya! I'm done, hundred bucks!

33:21.833 --> 33:24.036
I would have paid you
a hundred bucks

33:24.070 --> 33:25.771
not hear to any of this.
Oh, yeah?

33:25.804 --> 33:27.239
How did it go
with Ruby last night?

33:27.273 --> 33:30.242
Did you foil her plan
for global domination?

33:30.276 --> 33:32.278
We talked.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.280
We're good.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.215
Oh, I love it
when you are coy.

33:36.248 --> 33:38.217
You still have
feelings for her.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.686
Look, why can't we just say
that I am glad

33:40.719 --> 33:43.555
she's back in town
and leave it at that?

33:43.589 --> 33:45.057
Because I'm me.

33:45.091 --> 33:47.059
Morning.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.060
Lavon!

33:53.699 --> 33:56.302
* You seem so bad
and you seem all wrong *

33:56.335 --> 33:59.071
* But they never felt love
like a love this strong *

33:59.105 --> 34:02.441
* Don't give a darn
for what they have to say *

34:05.777 --> 34:08.080
* And they think we don't know

34:08.114 --> 34:09.447
* But we know too well

34:09.481 --> 34:11.850
* And I have no fear
what time will tell *

34:11.882 --> 34:15.420
* Don't give a darn
for what they have to say *

34:17.589 --> 34:19.257
How cool is this?

34:19.291 --> 34:20.391
Half of my school
is here.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.328
Excuse me while I walk
through the crowd,

34:22.360 --> 34:23.295
looking really important.

34:23.329 --> 34:24.295
But cool.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.431
Cool, right. Thanks!

34:30.502 --> 34:33.405
* They think it's the same
when they were young *

34:33.438 --> 34:36.208
* And they all were blind
and screamed, "How dumb!" *

34:36.242 --> 34:39.511
* Don't give a darn
for what they have to say... *

34:39.545 --> 34:42.281
Zoe! (laughs)

34:42.313 --> 34:44.315
Hey.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.185
Zoe, am I glad to see you.

34:46.217 --> 34:48.120
Thank you again
for performing today.

34:48.154 --> 34:49.455
Rose is so excited.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.322
My finger's numb.

34:51.357 --> 34:52.724
Say what?

34:52.757 --> 34:56.295
My middle finger of my right
hand is a tiny bit numb.

34:56.328 --> 34:57.696
Oh, when that happens to me,

34:57.729 --> 34:59.331
it's from so much flipping it
to Wade.

34:59.365 --> 35:01.467
Just switch hands.
I'm not kidding.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.536
Oh. Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
You know,

35:04.570 --> 35:08.307
it's probably...
just the nerves.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.742
Something's wrong with
the nerves in my pick hand?

35:10.776 --> 35:13.745
No! Like in nervous,
not like in nerve damage.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.547
Nerve damage?
Could it be that?

35:15.581 --> 35:16.415
No!

35:16.448 --> 35:19.318
Okay. Definitely not?

35:19.351 --> 35:22.621
Well, I mean, it could.

35:22.654 --> 35:25.391
There's a chance,
but very small.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.459
If it still feels like that in
a few days, go see a specialist.

35:32.398 --> 35:37.469
* The cure from yourself,
our voices in this town *

35:37.503 --> 35:39.905
* We know this love is on

35:39.938 --> 35:45.244
* When you're holding me
so tight to the end... *

35:45.277 --> 35:46.778
Hey, what are you doing?

35:46.812 --> 35:48.514
You're going on next.

35:48.547 --> 35:51.283
Yeah, well, see, we don't have
a lead singer anymore.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.951
Apparently, someone
told her that

35:52.984 --> 35:54.920
she might have nerve damage.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.422
What?

35:56.455 --> 35:58.290
No. No, no, no!

35:58.324 --> 36:00.926
I-I said, "could."
Very remote.

36:00.959 --> 36:02.294
Probably not.
Where is she?

36:02.328 --> 36:03.795
I'll talk to her.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.932
Well, she's on her way back to
Mobile now to see a specialist.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.400
So BlueBellapalooza
has no headliner,

36:08.434 --> 36:11.503
and Rose gets to eat
by the Dumpsters.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.904
You, uh, happy now?

36:12.938 --> 36:14.373
No, of course
I'm not happy.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.242
Do you think I did
this on purpose?

36:16.275 --> 36:18.677
Oh, I'm sorry.
You think you didn't?

36:18.710 --> 36:21.447
You didn't want me
sleeping with Lily Anne,

36:21.480 --> 36:22.248
didn't want George

36:22.281 --> 36:24.350
sleeping with...
whoever last night.

36:24.383 --> 36:26.818
Apparently, nobody can
have sex in BlueBell

36:26.852 --> 36:29.355
without a prescription
from Dr. Zoe Hart!

36:29.388 --> 36:31.823
That-that is not true, okay?
I'll fix this.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.992
Well, it's too late.
You won our bet.

36:34.025 --> 36:37.296
I'm not interested
anymore.

36:37.329 --> 36:38.930
So, uh, let's see.

36:40.599 --> 36:43.235
Here's a hundred bucks.

36:43.269 --> 36:44.336
Go hire yourself a new band.

36:54.546 --> 36:57.583
ZOE:
Just wait, wait. Wait.

36:57.616 --> 36:59.585
Can anyone sing?

36:59.618 --> 37:01.653
Can anyone sing?

37:01.687 --> 37:02.988
Can you sing?

37:03.021 --> 37:05.391
Anyone?

37:05.424 --> 37:07.826
George Tucker, don't move.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.495
What? Why? Why?

37:09.528 --> 37:11.530
Is there a bee
in my hair?
Huh?

37:11.563 --> 37:13.299
Is there a
bee in my hair?
No.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.933
There's been an emergency.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.035
I won't get into the
absurd details, but...

37:17.068 --> 37:19.305
I need you to sing
with Wade's band.

37:19.338 --> 37:20.572
(chuckles)

37:20.606 --> 37:21.807
(stammers)

37:21.840 --> 37:22.774
Me?

37:24.476 --> 37:26.512
You want me to sing?

37:26.545 --> 37:28.580
Yes. You sang in New Orleans,
and you were amazing.

37:28.614 --> 37:29.681
Yeah, but,
Zoe, that was

37:29.715 --> 37:31.617
in front of complete
and total strangers,

37:31.650 --> 37:33.519
and that was after I downed
three hurricanes, so...

37:33.552 --> 37:36.021
It's for Rose.
If I screw this up for her,

37:36.054 --> 37:37.188
I will never forgive myself.

37:37.222 --> 37:41.360
All right, do I have time
for at least one hurricane?

37:41.393 --> 37:43.295
Thank you.
Yeah.

37:43.329 --> 37:44.396
(laughs):
Thank you!

37:44.430 --> 37:45.497
Let's go.
Yeah. Okay.

37:45.531 --> 37:47.666
*
(crowd whooping)

37:47.699 --> 37:49.601
* Lord, I was born

37:49.635 --> 37:53.439
* A ramblin' man

37:53.472 --> 37:58.577
* Trying to make a living
and doing the best that I can *

37:58.610 --> 38:01.580
* But when it's time
for leavin' *

38:01.613 --> 38:03.882
* Well, I hope
you'll understand *

38:03.915 --> 38:06.985
* That I was born
a ramblin' man *

38:07.018 --> 38:08.487
(women shouting)

38:08.520 --> 38:09.921
* My father was

38:09.955 --> 38:13.392
* A gambler down in 'Bama

38:13.425 --> 38:17.396
* Wound up on the wrong end
of a gun... *

38:17.429 --> 38:19.898
Hmm. He's
really good.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.634
Yeah. You're not the only
one who's noticed.

38:22.668 --> 38:26.605
(cheering)

38:26.638 --> 38:28.006
Did you really tell
a hypochondriac

38:28.039 --> 38:29.608
she might have
nerve damage?

38:29.641 --> 38:31.076
Might.
Ha!

38:31.109 --> 38:34.045
I didn't know what I said
would send her away.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.313
I didn't.

38:36.848 --> 38:39.685
Come on, y'all,
put your hands together!

38:39.718 --> 38:43.054
Okay, even if I knew, I-I didn't
know that I knew, you know?

38:43.088 --> 38:44.423
No.

38:44.456 --> 38:46.458
I know.
There's something wrong with me.

38:46.492 --> 38:47.659
Well, it seems
pretty obvious.

38:47.693 --> 38:50.429
You don't want
Wade to have sex

38:50.462 --> 38:53.565
with somebody else
because you like him.

38:53.599 --> 38:55.567
No, I don't!
(chuckles)

38:55.601 --> 38:57.569
Wade drives me crazy.

38:57.603 --> 38:58.970
I like George.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.071
Haven't you been
paying attention?

39:00.105 --> 39:01.139
LAVON:
But you told George

39:01.172 --> 39:03.442
you two couldn't
be together.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.110
You told him to
date other people.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.612
I know I did.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.680
I just don't want him to.

39:08.714 --> 39:11.583
But you don't want Wade
to date anybody else, either.

39:11.617 --> 39:12.050
No.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.719
I know how selfish

39:13.752 --> 39:16.455
and horrible that sounds,
but I am a mess, okay?

39:16.488 --> 39:17.989
A complete
and utter mess!
It's okay.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.859
I mean, we all been
there. I guess.
Thank you.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.861
(sobs): You know,
I need some marshmallows.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.095
Okay.

39:26.565 --> 39:29.668
Wow! This is quite
some event.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.403
(chuckles)
Next year,

39:31.437 --> 39:32.771
we'll have to let
 Southern Living know.

39:32.804 --> 39:35.006
Maybe get us
back on the list.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.742
Us?

39:36.775 --> 39:38.610
Wait, wait,

39:38.644 --> 39:41.613
does that mean you're gonna
be around here next year?

39:41.647 --> 39:44.082
Actually, Lavon, I... I wanted
to talk to you about that.

39:44.115 --> 39:45.917
Oh, I'm all ears.
Well,

39:45.951 --> 39:48.954
I've decided to...
run against you.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.522
For mayor.

39:50.556 --> 39:51.923
(song ends, crowd cheering)

39:51.957 --> 39:53.525
(laughing)

39:53.559 --> 39:55.561
That's good.

39:55.594 --> 39:58.163
That's good.
(laughing)

39:58.196 --> 40:01.533
I love it! I like how serious
your face is right now.

40:01.567 --> 40:04.636
(laughing)

40:04.670 --> 40:05.571
I am serious.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.072
(hysterical laughing)

40:10.075 --> 40:11.510
(weak chuckle)

40:11.543 --> 40:13.845
I'm s-sorry,
you-you what, now?

40:13.879 --> 40:16.047
Lavon, listen, I know this isn't
the news you wanted to hear,

40:16.081 --> 40:17.549
but, I mean,
you basically said the job

40:17.583 --> 40:18.884
just fell into
your lap anyway, and...

40:18.917 --> 40:20.519
So you want to
take it from me?

40:20.552 --> 40:22.821
No. I said I was waiting
for the wind to come up

40:22.854 --> 40:23.889
and take me someplace.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.491
No, the only wind
around here

40:25.524 --> 40:28.059
was coming from your mouth,
when you said you weren't

40:28.093 --> 40:29.728
mad about high
school anymore.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.029
Come on, Lavon.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.197
Or is this it?

40:33.565 --> 40:35.901
Just to get my reaction.
No.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.504
(laughing):
Get in my head.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.506
You're not really
running, right?

40:40.539 --> 40:42.641
(chuckles)

40:42.674 --> 40:43.709
Or are you?

40:45.143 --> 40:47.112
I think we should
talk about this later.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.583
Huh.

40:51.617 --> 40:53.018
You're not getting

40:53.051 --> 40:54.720
in my head!

40:59.991 --> 41:01.727
Thank you.

41:04.996 --> 41:06.665
Stop it. Come on, now.

41:14.005 --> 41:16.875
(laughing)

41:20.245 --> 41:21.146
That was awesome.

41:21.179 --> 41:22.748
Who knew George Tucker
could sing like that?

41:22.781 --> 41:23.815
Not me.

41:25.584 --> 41:27.786
So, did we cement your
status as indie rock chick?

41:27.819 --> 41:29.988
For another week, at least.

41:30.021 --> 41:32.724
But to be honest,
I kind of miss being

41:32.758 --> 41:35.861
the ironic Japanese anime girl--
it was a lot less work.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.729
I can't wait till

41:37.763 --> 41:39.898
I'm all grown up and
know who I am and what I want.

41:42.601 --> 41:44.870
ZOE:
Rose,

41:44.903 --> 41:47.573
I hate to break it to you,
but even grown up,

41:47.606 --> 41:48.874
we're all 15 at heart.

41:53.612 --> 41:54.613
That is so good.

41:54.646 --> 41:56.682
(mumbling with mouth full)

41:56.715 --> 41:59.284
(laughs):
What was that?
