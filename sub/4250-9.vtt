12:54.690 --> 12:58.360
WILLOW, WE'RE IN COMPETITION
WITH THEM.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.740
- OH.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.533
I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT COMPETING.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.368
I JUST WANT EVERYONE TO WIN.

13:06.452 --> 13:10.080
- IT ISN'T HER FAULT.

13:10.164 --> 13:13.042
I ASKED HER TO HELP.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.210
- BEHIND MY BACK?

13:14.293 --> 13:15.794
- WELL, NOT--

13:15.878 --> 13:18.464
- WAS THIS BEFORE OR AFTER
YOU ATE ALL MY STOCK?

13:18.547 --> 13:19.423
- MARA, I THINK YOU'RE BLOWING
THIS WHOLE THING

13:19.507 --> 13:20.591
A LITTLE OUT OF PROPORTION.

13:20.674 --> 13:21.884
- NO, JEROME.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.720
ALL OF THIS IS TO MAKE SURE
I DIDN'T WIN.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.555
YOU'RE NOT THE PERSON
I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.808
I THINK WE SHOULD COOL IT
FOR A WHILE.

13:29.892 --> 13:30.309
- WELL, HANG ON A MINUTE.

13:30.392 --> 13:33.646
WH--MARA.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.483
[dog toy squeaks]

13:39.360 --> 13:40.653
- I TOLD YOU.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.112
I DON'T REMEMBER OPENING
ANY PACKAGE.

13:42.196 --> 13:42.947
- TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.199
WE SHALL START WITH YOUR ROOM.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.450
- OH, VICTOR.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.035
I'VE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE
FOR YOU.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.245
AMBER?

13:49.328 --> 13:50.246
- MISS MILLINGTON IS UNWELL.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.122
MR. SWEET HAS HAD ME
BRING HER HOME.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.541
- WELL, I'M HAVING A DISASTER.

13:53.624 --> 13:54.792
THE KITCHEN SINK'S LEAKING.

13:54.875 --> 13:55.668
THERE'S WATER SPRAYING
EVERYWHERE.

13:55.751 --> 14:00.548
- TRUDY.
- GET TO YOUR ROOM.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.218
- ALFIE, I'M REALLY NOT SURE
ABOUT THIS.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.261
MARA'S ALREADY MAD AT ME.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.054
- WILLOW, LOOK,
IF I DON'T DO THIS,

14:07.137 --> 14:11.392
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF,
SO PLEASE...FOR AMBER.

14:11.475 --> 14:12.351
- OKAY.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.019
- THANK YOU.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.021
- WHEN WE WERE LOOKING FOR
A HIGH-FIBER, LOW-FAT SNACK,

14:16.105 --> 14:16.814
WE THOUGHT,
"WHO BETTER TO LOOK TO

14:16.897 --> 14:19.275
THAN THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS?"

14:19.358 --> 14:20.568
- CLEVER.

14:20.651 --> 14:23.696
PUTTING A NEW SPIN
ON AN OLD THEME.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.114
MMM.

14:25.197 --> 14:25.948
THIS ONE'S DELICIOUS.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.576
- IT'S CALLED FESEEKH.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.328
IT'S ROTTEN FISH.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.580
- WOW.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.289
- IT'S NICE.
- WHO KNEW?

14:33.372 --> 14:36.125
[laughter]

14:36.208 --> 14:37.501
WHAT CAN I SAY?

14:37.585 --> 14:39.128
GREAT PRESENTATION.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.212
- THANK YOU.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.381
- WELL, THAT'S EVERYBODY.
- HELLO?

14:42.464 --> 14:43.048
[microphone feedback]

14:43.132 --> 14:45.092
EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE, HI.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.468
LOOK,
I REALIZE AMBER'S NOT HERE,

14:46.552 --> 14:49.847
BUT SHE WANTED TO USE THIS
PROJECT TO SHOW OFF HER TALENT,

14:49.930 --> 14:51.932
AND, WELL, I OWE THIS TO HER.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.685
SO IF EVERYONE'S READY
TO ROCK....

14:54.768 --> 14:58.814
[cheers and applause]

14:58.897 --> 15:00.774
HIT IT, KT.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.943
THAT'S RIGHT; AMBER MILLINGTON
PROUDLY PRESENTS

15:03.027 --> 15:04.236
"FOODIE FASHION."

15:04.320 --> 15:06.864
WILLOW IS MODELING
A MOUTH-WATERING CHOW-FEST.

15:06.947 --> 15:10.034
IT'S GOOD-BYE, BLACK DRESS
AND HELLO, SNACK DRESS.

15:10.117 --> 15:13.245
[cheers and applause]

15:13.329 --> 15:16.373
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF,
YOUR VERY OWN SNACK HAT.

15:16.457 --> 15:17.583
IT'S FUN.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.752
IT'S FUNKY.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.420
IT'S AMBER.

15:21.503 --> 15:24.673
[cheers and applause]

15:24.757 --> 15:27.885
[microphone feedback]

15:27.968 --> 15:29.219
MR. MILLINGTON.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.638
- NOW, HOLD ON.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.514
I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

15:32.598 --> 15:34.850
BUT THAT FASHION SCHOOL
IS GONNA DO NOTHING

15:34.933 --> 15:37.519
BUT FILL AMBER'S HEAD WITH EVEN
MORE FAR-FETCHED IDEAS.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.897
I'M SORRY.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.775
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT HER TO GO,
EITHER.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.572
BUT IF YOU'RE HALF AS PROUD
OF AMBER AS I AM, THEN, WELL,

15:48.656 --> 15:51.283
AT LEAST THINK ABOUT IT.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.786
THEY DIDN'T HEADHUNT HER
FOR NO REASON.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.371
SHE'S REALLY TALENTED.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.914
- ALL RIGHT--

15:56.997 --> 15:59.667
- WELL, EVERYBODY,
WE HAVE SOME JUDGING TO DO.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.418
TAKE A BREAK,
BUT I WANT EVERYONE BACK HERE

16:01.502 --> 16:03.921
IN TEN MINUTES.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.798
- OKAY, NOW'S OUR CHANCE.
LET'S GO AND GET AMBER.

16:05.881 --> 16:09.927
- YOU THREE, I NEED VOLUNTEERS
TO HELP SET UP THE STAGE.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.845
- BUT, SIR--
- NO BUTS, PATRICIA.

16:11.929 --> 16:12.930
COME.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.349
COME ON.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.924
- WELL, THAT IS IT.

16:49.007 --> 16:50.759
AS SOON AS THIS IS OVER, WE'RE
GETTING BACK TO THE GATEHOUSE.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.137
- NOW, AS YOU KNOW,

16:53.220 --> 16:56.557
EVERYONE'S BUSINESS PROJECT
WILL BE GRADED AS USUAL.

16:56.640 --> 17:00.769
HOWEVER, THERE IS A SMALL MATTER
OF A SPECIAL PRIZE

17:00.853 --> 17:03.772
FOR THE VERY BEST IDEA.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.943
A BRAND-NEW LAPTOP-Y,
COMPUTER-Y THING, NO LESS.

17:08.026 --> 17:10.820
[cheers and applause]

17:12.156 --> 17:14.450
SO NOW I'D LIKE TO ASK
MR. MILLINGTON

17:14.532 --> 17:17.453
TO PLEASE DO THE HONORS.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.538
[applause]

17:19.621 --> 17:20.455
- I'VE MADE A DECISION.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.707
AFTER WHAT'S HAPPENED TODAY,

17:21.790 --> 17:24.334
IT'S OBVIOUS THIS SCHOOL
IS NOT PROVIDING AMBER

17:24.417 --> 17:25.586
WITH THE MENTAL STIMULATION
SHE REQUIRES.

17:25.669 --> 17:27.963
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

17:28.047 --> 17:30.799
- I'M SAYING THAT FASHION COURSE
STARTS ON MONDAY,

17:30.883 --> 17:32.050
AND AMBER WILL BE THERE.

17:33.635 --> 17:37.139
WHEN I'M DONE HERE,
AMBER'S COMING HOME WITH ME.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.766
[applause]

17:43.353 --> 17:45.564
- HURRY UP. COME ON.
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

17:45.647 --> 17:48.442
- IT'S A GREAT HONOR
TO ANNOUNCE THE WINNER

17:48.525 --> 17:51.653
OF YOUR VERY FIRST
BUSINESS STUDIES COMPETITION.

17:51.737 --> 17:55.824
THE WINNING SNACK IS AN IDEA
THAT ASKED,

17:55.908 --> 17:57.993
"WHAT DOES THIS PLACE
HAVE TO OFFER

17:58.076 --> 17:59.453
THAT NO OTHER BUSINESS COULD?"

17:59.536 --> 18:04.208
THE ANSWER IS...

18:04.291 --> 18:05.584
"A TASTE OF ANUBIS,"

18:05.667 --> 18:07.628
JOY MERCER
AND FABIAN RUTTER.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.339
[cheers and applause]

18:16.929 --> 18:17.679
- WHAT CAN I SAY?

18:17.763 --> 18:20.891
PERFECT PARTNERS.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.352
CONGRATULATIONS.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.938
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
MILLINGTON.

18:26.021 --> 18:29.191
- NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'LL GO AND FETCH AMBER.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.069
- TELL VICTOR HE HAS TO FIND
THAT PACKAGE IMMEDIATELY.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.946
I'LL STALL MILLINGTON SOMEHOW.

18:34.029 --> 18:34.530
MR. MILLINGTON?

18:34.613 --> 18:36.532
- [silently]

18:36.615 --> 18:37.866
- LOOK, TAKE IT.
I'VE GOT TO GO.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.452
- FABIAN, FABIAN,
NOT SO FAST.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.038
I'VE ASKED KT
TO TAKE SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF YOU

18:43.121 --> 18:45.457
AND THE WINNERS,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.625
- IF WE COULD HURRY THIS ALONG,
MR. SWEET?

18:46.708 --> 18:48.919
- OF COURSE.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.964
NOW, KT,
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE EVERYONE?

18:52.047 --> 18:54.466
- JUST AROUND THE TABLE.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.427
- CHEESE.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.679
[camera shutter clicks]

18:59.888 --> 19:01.223
- VICTOR?

19:01.306 --> 19:03.642
- YES.
I'M UNDER HERE.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.394
- WHAT ON EARTH?

19:05.477 --> 19:06.603
WHERE'S AMBER?

19:06.687 --> 19:07.229
- OH, SHE'S SICK.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.605
DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

19:08.689 --> 19:10.899
- OF COURSE,

19:10.983 --> 19:14.069
ONLY I NEED TO SPEAK
TO VICTOR...

19:14.153 --> 19:14.278
NOW.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.909
- THERE, ALL DONE.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.745
- OH, YEAH,
BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THIS MESS?

19:23.829 --> 19:27.124
VICTOR.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.506
- FOUND IT.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.134
ALTHOUGH, I STILL DON'T REMEMBER
HOW I GOT IT, WHATEVER IT IS,

19:37.217 --> 19:40.220
OR HOW I GOT MY HAIR TO LOOK
THIS GREAT.

20:01.199 --> 20:04.620
- ROUGH DAY, HUH?

20:04.703 --> 20:07.539
- MY WHOLE WORLD'S UPSIDE DOWN.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.374
MY DAD ISN'T WHO I THINK HE IS,

20:09.458 --> 20:12.044
AND DENBY ISN'T WHO WE THINK
SHE IS.

20:12.127 --> 20:17.132
- I'M WHO YOU THINK I AM,
I THINK.

20:17.215 --> 20:18.800
- [scoffs]

20:18.884 --> 20:21.011
- SERIOUSLY, KT,

20:21.094 --> 20:23.263
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HANDLE
ALL THIS.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.723
MY HEAD'S FRIED.

20:24.806 --> 20:29.645
- LISTEN, WHAT DID YOU SAY WHEN
YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT MY KEY?

20:29.728 --> 20:31.647
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
THE OSIRIAN,

20:31.730 --> 20:35.400
AND IF ANYONE CAN
HANDLE THIS, IT'S YOU.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.902
- [laughs]

20:36.985 --> 20:39.112
AND YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WHO
THAT WOMAN IN YOUR VISION WAS,

20:39.196 --> 20:40.238
RIGHT?

20:40.322 --> 20:41.740
- YEAH.

20:41.823 --> 20:44.701
- SO WE'RE GONNA DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

20:44.785 --> 20:47.120
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON,
OKAY?

20:47.204 --> 20:50.958
- YEAH,
ALL RIGHT,

20:51.041 --> 20:53.460
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

20:55.253 --> 20:57.631
- COME ON.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.216
INSIDE, QUICKLY.

20:59.299 --> 21:01.176
- I GAVE YOU THE PACKAGE.
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

21:01.259 --> 21:05.555
- GO AND FETCH ERIC.

21:05.639 --> 21:06.390
- AMBER?

21:08.558 --> 21:10.560
- THE SPY HOLE.
LET'S GO.

21:13.605 --> 21:17.150
- AMBER, I HAVE SOME NEWS.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.028
AS YOU KNOW,
YOUR FATHER WAS NEVER KEEN

21:20.112 --> 21:23.407
ON YOU GOING TO FASHION SCHOOL.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.159
- DADDY WANTS ME TO BE
A PHARMACIST.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.245
BUT REALLY?
ME ON A FARM?

21:28.328 --> 21:29.246
- UGH.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.206
- UNBELIEVABLE.

21:31.289 --> 21:33.041
BUT AFTER AN IMPASSIONED PLEA
FROM ALFIE LEWIS

21:33.125 --> 21:36.378
AND ONE OR TWO OTHER FACTORS,

21:36.461 --> 21:40.382
IT SEEMS HE'S NOW RATHER
DETERMINED THAT YOU DO GO.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.884
- WAIT,
BUT WHAT ABOUT MY FRIENDS?

21:42.968 --> 21:46.221
- I SUGGEST YOU TAKE THIS
WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY.

21:46.304 --> 21:47.556
- FOR THEIR SAKE.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.232
- [gasps]

21:57.315 --> 21:59.776
IT'S AMBER.

21:59.860 --> 22:03.822
- SO IN THE END, AMBER, YOU'VE
GOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANTED.

22:03.905 --> 22:07.284
- AND ALL YOU HAD TO GIVE US
WAS ONE VERY SIMPLE PARCEL.

22:07.367 --> 22:11.788
- I'D CALL THAT A BARGAIN.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.668
- ALFIE, ARE YOU OKAY?

22:16.752 --> 22:18.128
- WHAT DID THEY SAY?

22:18.211 --> 22:21.173
- IT'S AMBER.

22:21.256 --> 22:23.050
SHE'S BETRAYED US.
