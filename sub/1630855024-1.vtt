00:01.334 --> 00:03.378
<i>Previously on</i> Doogie Kamealoha, M.D...

00:03.378 --> 00:06.256
She's like a real-life Doogie Howser.
That's why we call her Doogie.

00:06.256 --> 00:09.968
<i>For as long as I can remember,
I've been in a rush to grow up</i>

00:09.968 --> 00:12.303
<i>getting into med school,
becoming a doctor,</i>

00:12.303 --> 00:13.638
<i>my first relationship.</i>

00:13.638 --> 00:16.016
- I love you, Lahela.
- I love you, too.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.726
What's wrong?
- That was the Global Surf League.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.728
They want me to join the tour
this summer in Australia.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.731
No, you're not going with your boyfriend
to Australia at 16.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.858
<i>Being a great mom
means living your life</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:26.526
<i>as an example for your kids.</i>

00:26.526 --> 00:30.280
I can't tell you to be you
if I'm not being me.

00:30.280 --> 00:35.076
Please join me in congratulating
your new chief of staff, Dr. Hannon.

00:35.076 --> 00:39.247
Uncle John's back to busting my chops.
I guess the healing chant worked.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.832
<i>He's the last one
of that generation.</i>

00:40.832 --> 00:42.917
The last one that can talk story
about my dad.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.879
When you take someone's role
in the family, it means they're gone.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.547
I'm not ready to say goodbye.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.257
You need to go to Australia.

00:49.257 --> 00:52.135
Are you sure this is really what you want?

00:52.135 --> 00:53.303
Yeah.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.871
Last one in's a rotten egg.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.675
Lahela, Lahela. Lahela!

02:13.675 --> 02:15.385
Do you like my Gel-X nails?

02:16.344 --> 02:19.472
You show them to me every five minutes.
And yes, I love them.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.060
Let me guess. Daydreaming about Walter?

02:24.060 --> 02:27.230
Only two more weeks and he's back
from his Australian surf tour.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.983
A perfectly bronzed boomerang
returning to me.

02:29.983 --> 02:30.900
Oh.

02:30.900 --> 02:31.860
Shark!

02:31.860 --> 02:33.403
Somebody help!

02:33.403 --> 02:35.405
Help!

02:35.405 --> 02:37.574
CASSIE'S MOM: I can't find my daughter.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.118
Cassie.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.287
Oh, my God. Cassie!

02:42.287 --> 02:44.581
I got her.
There's a shark out there.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.833
- I think she got bit.
- Hey, do you mind if I borrow that?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.835
- Dude, there's a shark out there.
- Yeah, I heard.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.847
Help! Help! It bit me!

03:00.847 --> 03:03.183
I'm coming.
Just stay calm, Cassie.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.309
Help!

03:06.186 --> 03:07.770
I'm bleeding. I think the shark bit me.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.564
It hurts, it hurts.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.109
She did it.

03:25.121 --> 03:27.165
It's okay. I got you. Here we go.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.499
CASSIE'S MOM: Oh, my God, sweetie.

03:28.499 --> 03:29.459
Are you okay?

03:29.459 --> 03:32.212
Eight-centimeter bite radius
along the lateral triceps.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.422
Puncture appears to have missed
a humeral circumflex

03:34.422 --> 03:35.882
and brachial artery.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.218
Don't worry, Cassie.
I'm going to take care of you. Okay.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.428
Thelma, Louise, I need your towel.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.180
Thank you. Okay.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.642
Endless Summer, I need your Padillac.

03:46.684 --> 03:47.936
Thank you!

03:49.687 --> 03:51.314
Lahela, is there anything
I can do to help?

03:51.314 --> 03:52.732
Yes.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.610
Put in a mobile order for some boba
because we're done here.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.280
Cassie, are you more of a matcha
or mango popping kind of girl?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.365
This one's on me.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.451
- Thank you so much. And mango.
- Okay.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.662
Who is this kid?

04:05.662 --> 04:06.621
We've been over this.

04:06.621 --> 04:09.791
She's Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.,
and I'm her best friend.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.043
Someone get me a harpoon.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.003
I've got a shark to hunt.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.038
Dude, it looks like Walter's living
his best life in Australia.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.291
I've been sucked deep into his Insta.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.376
Is that weird of me? Don't answer that.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.504
It is like, he is living
in an Abercrombie ad.

04:56.504 --> 04:59.590
He's tan, he's happy.
And did he even pack a shirt?

04:59.590 --> 05:01.676
Well, it's his dream
to be sponsored as a surfer,

05:01.676 --> 05:03.511
so he's trying to raise his profile.

05:03.511 --> 05:06.389
- How long distance going?
- Oh, better than ever.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.976
It's going to take a lot more
than 5,071 miles to keep us apart.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.228
Spoken like a true 16-year-old.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.563
What?

05:13.563 --> 05:15.106
With... love.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.567
We've both done long distance.
We know it can be tough.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.068
Yeah, you know, it's only natural.

05:19.068 --> 05:21.487
The person who moves away
experiences so many new things,

05:21.487 --> 05:24.282
they change
and then you just, like, grow apart.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.535
Exactly. You stop communicating.
You stop sharing things.

05:27.535 --> 05:30.747
Ugh. When they stop telling you stuff,
that's when you know it's over.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.332
Also, when they start selling your stuff.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.878
Argh. Okay, well, with love,
that's not happening with Walter and me.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.255
Are you talking about
a long distance relationship?

05:39.255 --> 05:40.548
It's doomed.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.759
It's the same chances
as that overweight smoker

05:42.759 --> 05:44.469
whose arteries I just replaced.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.054
Zero.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.930
Well, Walter and I are very happy.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.515
Oh, really? Okay, let's see here.

05:49.515 --> 05:53.394
He's a good looking guy
on his own in Australia.

05:53.394 --> 05:54.896
What do you think's going on over there?

05:54.896 --> 05:57.774
I mean, to those girls,
he's the one with the accent.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.443
You know how sexy accents are.
I wish I had one.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.159
Merge, damn it.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.912
Clara, you're still at this?

06:10.912 --> 06:12.997
You've been working on this budget
since last night.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.625
I have to present it
to the hospital board today.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.710
I had no idea being chief of staff

06:17.710 --> 06:21.047
would require
this many Excel spreadsheets.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.258
Insert cell. Damn it, merge.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.928
There you go. You should be good.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.847
Back in my finance days,
I used to rock Excel hard.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.017
Ah, remember those super long shorts
I had to wear?

06:33.017 --> 06:34.811
Pants?

06:34.811 --> 06:36.771
- You ready to go, Kai?
- If we're taking your car,

06:36.771 --> 06:38.481
then we should have left an hour ago.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.774
That thing always breaks down.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.692
The surf wagon runs great.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.904
Uncle John sold me that car
when I was in my 20s.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.865
Hard to believe he's gone.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.367
Uncle John was the best.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.578
- Ah.
- I really miss his weird, guttural laugh.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.664
It was like a whale in heat.

06:58.042 --> 07:00.169
He never laughed harder than
when it was at my expense.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.754
He was always giving me a hard time.

07:01.754 --> 07:05.049
Like when he sold me the surf wagon,
he loosened the steering wheel.

07:05.049 --> 07:08.010
So when I drove away,
it fell off and I hit a tree.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.595
That's so dangerous.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.515
Hawaii style, huh? Just good fun.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.268
Brian Patrick, let's go!

07:17.437 --> 07:18.980
Which one looks more vaporwave?

07:18.980 --> 07:20.440
I'm sorry, what?

07:20.440 --> 07:23.025
Seventh grade starts in three days.
I'm trying to find my aesthetic.

07:23.025 --> 07:24.485
You know, my vibe.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.446
Am I cottagecore, health goth,

07:26.446 --> 07:28.906
dark academia, that girl, E-boy,

07:28.906 --> 07:31.200
VSCO, angelcore, Criss Angelcore...

07:31.200 --> 07:33.578
What are any of those things?

07:33.578 --> 07:36.622
It's like, "Who should I be?"

07:36.622 --> 07:38.332
Oh, how about yourself?

07:38.332 --> 07:41.043
Wow, you're so momcore.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.336
Thank you.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.134
Come on, Donna. Look at him.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.386
His skin, his eyes. He's jaundiced.

07:50.386 --> 07:53.973
Okay, it could be hepatitis,
a stone, hemolytic anemia.

07:53.973 --> 07:57.101
It could be cancer, sepsis,
cholestasis, anything.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.729
We have to get him admitted
and run some tests.

07:59.729 --> 08:03.107
I'm sorry, Dr. Kamealoha,
but he doesn't have an address.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.318
No Social Security number
and no insurance.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.319
I mean, come on.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.863
He is a human being. Is that not enough?

08:08.863 --> 08:12.116
He's stable and can get care
at the county hospital.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.493
That's policy.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.750
Hi. Go to
the County Health Care Center, okay?

08:20.750 --> 08:23.085
Ask for Dr. Bennett. She's a friend.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.462
Oh, and here.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.089
Take the number three bus.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.010
- Thank you.
- Of course.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.560
I'm just doing my job.

08:40.645 --> 08:44.857
You know that little pink donor card
on the back of your driver's license?

08:44.857 --> 08:46.817
- Yes.
- Scratch off heart.

08:46.817 --> 08:49.320
Dr. Kamealoha, a word.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.991
You need to bring it down a notch.

08:53.991 --> 08:57.078
Mom, that is the fourth unhoused person
we've turned away this week.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.330
And I'm not talking cuts and scrapes here.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.540
Look, I don't like it either.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.626
But there are county facilities
set up to help them.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.961
It's just so messed up.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.671
I mean, at the beach,
I was able to jump in

09:06.671 --> 09:10.091
and give someone medical care,
but I can't do that in my own hospital?

09:10.091 --> 09:13.177
- I mean, it just doesn't feel right.
- Those are the rules.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.513
We don't have the funds to help everyone.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.766
And as chief of staff,
it's my job to balance the budget

09:18.766 --> 09:21.060
and I have a board to answer to.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.690
I know it's not ideal,
but it is what it is.

09:25.690 --> 09:29.360
Oh, way to be the change, Mom.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.327
And that's this year's budget.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.706
How is it, Dr. Hannon,

09:42.415 --> 09:45.501
that you're running an average
occupancy of 90 percent

09:45.501 --> 09:48.296
with a gross income
of 200 million dollars,

09:48.296 --> 09:52.717
but your bottom line is barely
one-tenth of one percent in the black?

09:53.092 --> 09:55.011
That's a hair away from red ink.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.556
Marjorie, I'm well aware
of how close the red ink is.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.266
What are you spending all that money on?

10:00.266 --> 10:03.227
The reconstruction of the Mauka Wing,
among other things--

10:03.227 --> 10:06.314
Well, I, for one, would like to see
where this money is going.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.275
Well, let's set up an appointment,
shall we?

10:09.275 --> 10:11.736
- Next week--
- Tomorrow morning, 8:00 a.m.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.654
Tomorrow it is.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.994
<i>X-ray tech to Floor 2F.</i>

10:19.994 --> 10:21.120
This is a hospital...

10:21.120 --> 10:22.330
But...

10:23.748 --> 10:25.499
But...
- I will take care of this.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.169
Hi. What's the problem?

10:28.169 --> 10:31.047
I was on my bike
and Pickles was running alongside.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.298
All of a sudden, she was gone.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.800
I heard the brakes,
and then I saw this car go right over her

10:34.800 --> 10:35.926
and keep on going.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.345
Why don't you take her to the vet?

10:37.345 --> 10:40.181
My family, my family can't afford that.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.767
Hospitals have to help everybody, right?

10:42.767 --> 10:44.685
Please, you've got to help me.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.020
You've got to help Pickles.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.492
I can't believe
how long you took to get ready.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.369
Yeah. What are we going for here?

11:01.369 --> 11:04.497
You look like a tourist who's been carried
to the top of Mount Everest.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.457
This is hypebeast.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.709
It's basically people
who embrace the latest trends.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.628
Emphasis on the sneakers.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.798
You need full-coverage sandals? Toe jail?

11:13.798 --> 11:14.840
No, thank you.

11:14.840 --> 11:15.841
Hypebeast?

11:15.841 --> 11:19.387
Big jump from your current vibe
of Target Cat and Jack line.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.972
If it's not a risk, it's not fashion.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.563
Oh, man.

11:29.563 --> 11:30.773
Just give me a sec.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.441
Uncle John, taught me this trick.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.486
Take a bobby pin
and you wiggle it in the ignition

11:35.486 --> 11:37.029
and it always starts right back up.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.204
I think the surf wagon is officially...

11:45.204 --> 11:46.122
...dead.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.748
I'd say we should light up some flares,

11:47.748 --> 11:49.667
but BP could probably
just go stand outside.

11:49.667 --> 11:54.004
Yes, we can finally get a new car.
How about a Porsche 9-11?

11:55.089 --> 11:56.590
You're right. You're not ready.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.342
We'll start you off with a Boxster.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.430
Two fracture lines
across the neck of the femur.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.056
But the fragments are in good position.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.475
No joint replacement necessary.
It could be pinned.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.894
How did you get a dog through the X-ray?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.479
Heavy sedation.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.106
And Dr. Chin was on duty.

12:12.106 --> 12:15.234
His iPhone background is his pug,
so I knew I had an in.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.611
Hmm. So what's your plan, Doog?

12:17.611 --> 12:20.156
Well, I need to stabilize her,
get her out of shock.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.825
They're clear breaks,
so it should be easy to repair.

12:22.825 --> 12:23.868
Who's going to do it?

12:24.702 --> 12:26.871
- We are.
-"We?"

12:26.871 --> 12:28.414
We're not vets.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.082
Think about how much a vet would cost.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.959
Thousands of dollars
this kid doesn't have.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.419
And we can help him for free.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.088
He's out of options. We are his last hope.

12:36.088 --> 12:39.175
Okay, well, how are you going
to get a dog into the O.R.?

12:39.175 --> 12:40.718
A trench coat and glasses?

12:40.718 --> 12:42.011
I mean, adorbs, but come on.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.596
Number four in the Mauka Wing.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.306
The workers haven't
finished the outer hall

12:45.306 --> 12:47.099
but the room is totally ready
and functional.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.477
We'll be in and out half hour max.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.396
There's no way we can do this.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.522
Okay.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.150
I'll let you tell Pickles, then.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.281
Oh.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.283
I really hate you, Lahela.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.743
Oh, who can say no to this?

13:07.077 --> 13:08.370
Hi, Pickles.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.372
In.

13:10.372 --> 13:11.582
Yes.
Aw.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.542
I can never say no to a cute dog,

13:13.542 --> 13:16.712
or a dance floor line,
or guys with tattoos.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.131
You better keep him away from Walter then.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.091
What? Walter doesn't have a tattoo.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.301
Yes, he does.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.677
On his thigh.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.095
Have you been on the 'gram today?

13:27.431 --> 13:28.349
What the...

13:28.349 --> 13:30.184
Wait, he got a tattoo and didn't tell you?

13:32.937 --> 13:35.314
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.358
It's no big deal. Right, Noelani?

13:37.358 --> 13:40.152
Oh, no, actually, tattoos are a big deal
in Polynesian culture.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.237
I mean, for a guy like Walter,

13:41.237 --> 13:44.782
getting a tattoo marks his transition
from being a little boy to becoming a man.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.034
I mean, this is huge.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.578
What? That's what it said on his caption.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.629
Hey, Dad, I did some new car research,

13:58.629 --> 14:02.174
and there are cars that get better
gas mileage than eight miles per gallon.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.717
All of them.

14:03.717 --> 14:06.428
Oh, thanks, Kai. It's helpful.

14:09.056 --> 14:12.226
I'm going to fix this baby up
and have it working in no time.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.729
Starting now.

14:22.736 --> 14:23.821
I'm an E-boy now.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.866
It really speaks to my introverted nature.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.786
What's an E-boy?

14:32.037 --> 14:35.416
Honestly, Dad, it would be more productive
to try to teach you about aesthetics

14:35.416 --> 14:37.585
than it would to try and fix
this hunk of junk.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.044
I mean, look at all these dents.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.255
Hey, dents mean you had fun in a car.

14:41.255 --> 14:45.092
This one is from when Uncle threw
a mongoose in my lap on the H-1.

14:45.092 --> 14:48.178
Those scratches are from when he
made me surf the car.

14:48.178 --> 14:51.098
I was up on the roof washing
and off we went.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.059
Cops pulled us over to compliment my form.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.186
And also arrest us.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.106
Great night.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.568
Do you think maybe you don't want
to get rid of this car

15:02.568 --> 15:04.028
because it was Uncle John's?

15:04.028 --> 15:07.615
No. It's just me being frugal. Look.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.536
I haven't paid for soy sauce
in over 20 years.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.417
So you got a tattoo?

15:18.417 --> 15:20.544
<i>Yeah. Isn't it dope?</i>

15:20.544 --> 15:22.630
It is. I just...

15:22.630 --> 15:24.715
It seems like a culturally
significant tattoo

15:24.715 --> 15:26.717
is something you would tell
your girlfriend about.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.595
<i>Sorry, it's been so crazy out here.</i>

15:29.595 --> 15:30.930
<i>Can I make it up to you?</i>

15:30.930 --> 15:32.473
<i>You want to do a FaceTime date?</i>

15:32.473 --> 15:36.518
<i>You find a beach. I'll go to a beach
and spend some time just me and you.</i>

15:36.518 --> 15:38.270
I would love that.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.605
<i>Great.</i>

15:39.605 --> 15:40.689
<i>All right, the waves are hitting.</i>

15:40.689 --> 15:42.566
<i>Me and Blake gotta get a session.
I love you.</i>

15:42.566 --> 15:45.152
Love you, too. Bye.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.200
How's the patient?

15:52.451 --> 15:54.870
Stable.
And shedding.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.581
Ready for the Knowles pins.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.124
Hand me the drill.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.254
Hold her steady.
We need to stabilize the leg.

16:06.882 --> 16:10.552
Now, this next operating room
is not only top of the line

16:10.552 --> 16:14.723
but it was designed with a window
so we can use it for teaching.

16:14.723 --> 16:17.810
It looks as though
there's a surgery going on right now.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.019
Yes, it does.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.315
Excuse me. What surgery is this?

16:24.775 --> 16:26.110
Uh...

16:26.652 --> 16:28.904
Just a little minor surgery.

16:28.904 --> 16:33.450
We had to use this facility
because everything else was backed up.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.871
Is that a dog?

16:40.290 --> 16:42.918
What the hell were you thinking?

16:42.918 --> 16:46.880
It's my first week as chief of staff
and you operate on a dog?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.841
At least someone was getting help
around here.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.926
What's that supposed to mean?

16:50.926 --> 16:52.845
You said you wanted
to become chief of staff

16:52.845 --> 16:54.179
so you could make a difference.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.307
We turn away tons of people
who need our help.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.101
All you care about is the stupid budget.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.979
Lahela, you don't get it.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.148
The budget is everything.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.817
If I, if I don't keep it on track,
nobody gets help.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.569
The hospital closes.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.653
And if I fail...

17:11.780 --> 17:14.158
they won't put another woman
in this position.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.160
Not for a long time.

17:18.495 --> 17:23.459
I know operating on a dog was crazy.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.544
But I just, I hit my breaking point,

17:25.544 --> 17:29.590
and I just couldn't tell one more person
that I couldn't help them.

17:30.841 --> 17:34.303
Well, because of this little stunt,
you won't be helping anyone.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.639
The board has officially suspended you.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.309
What?

17:40.809 --> 17:43.145
- No, they can't do that.
- They can.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.313
They did.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.315
I tried to stand up for you...

17:46.315 --> 17:48.358
Just like you did
for all the uninsured people

17:48.358 --> 17:49.860
you won't let me treat.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.953
Hey, I heard we're doing
animal surgeries now.

17:59.953 --> 18:02.331
I was going to give my cat a boob job.
Is that cool?

18:02.998 --> 18:04.208
Think about it.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.803
Hey, you know what we haven't tried?

18:15.803 --> 18:17.304
To clear the carburetor.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.722
Hand me a screwdriver.

18:24.853 --> 18:27.689
- Almost there.
- Dad, you've been at this for a while.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.316
It's over.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.861
Just... a little bit more.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.161
You okay?

18:43.455 --> 18:44.456
You're right.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.667
It's not the car.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.170
It's Uncle John's birthday on Friday.

18:52.005 --> 18:53.090
And I miss him.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.009
We all miss him.

18:59.263 --> 19:02.057
It's just going to be weird
he's not here to celebrate it.

19:03.851 --> 19:07.104
Remember when he used to get us together
at the beach and make us all tell stories

19:07.104 --> 19:08.897
- of how amazing he is?
- Yes.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.817
And every time you started to talk,
he blew an air horn.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.363
He used to love to bust my chops.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.908
One time I told him
he was like a father to me.

19:19.908 --> 19:23.954
He said, "Boy, I've slept on pillows
that weren't as soft as you."

19:25.789 --> 19:27.082
Ah.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.710
You know, just because he's not here
doesn't mean

19:29.710 --> 19:31.378
that we can't still celebrate him.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.841
Maybe we can keep
his birthday tradition going.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.095
Guys, I think this is it.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.597
Indie Kid is my jam.

19:42.222 --> 19:45.434
And, yes, I know
this is for Aunt Janice's 40th birthday.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.935
I'll return it though.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.756
<i>Lahela, you're not going to believe this.
I just got sponsored by Nuked!</i>

20:16.506 --> 20:17.758
The energy drink.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.052
Wow. That's amazing.
<i>We did it.</i>

20:20.052 --> 20:21.929
<i>What? Yeah.
We did it, man.</i>

20:21.929 --> 20:23.680
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

20:23.680 --> 20:25.641
<i>Oh, thanks man. It's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, right.</i>

20:25.641 --> 20:28.477
<i>Yeah, Blake's throwing this impromptu
party together for me to celebrate.</i>

20:28.477 --> 20:30.312
<i>Isn't that so nice of Blake?</i>

20:30.312 --> 20:33.315
Oh, so do you want
to do our date another time?

20:34.358 --> 20:36.235
<i>Crap. Right, our date.</i>

20:36.235 --> 20:38.612
<i>- Let me call you right back, okay?</i>
- Okay, because I can...

21:33.834 --> 21:35.877
<i>Is papier-mâché poisoning our children?</i>

21:35.877 --> 21:37.629
<i>Toenails, do we really need them?</i>

21:37.629 --> 21:40.299
<i>How many jellybeans
does it take to kill a man?</i>

21:40.299 --> 21:42.968
<i>And can I bench 150?</i>

21:42.968 --> 21:44.469
<i>I'm Rip Tide,</i>

21:44.469 --> 21:46.305
<i>and you'll find out after the break.</i>

21:46.305 --> 21:48.348
I love this guy.

21:48.348 --> 21:51.018
It's nice to see you smile again.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.686
Sorry about your surf wagon.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.938
I think it's time to move on and...

21:56.064 --> 21:57.232
get a new car.

21:57.232 --> 22:01.862
Oh, a new car where all the doors work?

22:01.862 --> 22:02.779
It's exciting.

22:03.613 --> 22:04.906
How are you doing?

22:06.783 --> 22:09.411
Well, it's my first week
as chief of staff,

22:09.411 --> 22:13.165
and all I've done is work
on this stupid budget.

22:13.165 --> 22:16.793
They don't see the value in serving
the entire community,

22:16.793 --> 22:20.964
but Lahela does,
and she got suspended for that.

22:21.548 --> 22:23.425
The board has got this all wrong.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.303
I know you.

22:27.262 --> 22:30.015
And I know you'll figure out
a way to make them see that.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.017
Thanks.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.313
<i>Spot! Spot, spot, spot.</i>

22:37.272 --> 22:39.358
Get it Rip Tide, get.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.359
Get it.

22:48.992 --> 22:52.287
Give her one of these
three times a day in her food.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.122
She should be up and walking soon.

22:54.122 --> 22:58.585
- Thank you, Dr. Kamealoha.
- Any time. But I didn't do it alone.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.173
Thanks. And thanks from Pickles, too.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.091
Oh.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.884
You're welcome, Pickles.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.928
I'm going to miss you. Mm.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.597
See, this is why I couldn't become a vet.

23:10.597 --> 23:12.182
She was a better patient than most.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.226
She didn't wet the bed
or tell me how to do my job.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.354
- Give me a sec and then I'll walk you out.
- All right.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.567
We're going to miss you, Lahela.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.611
The suspension will be over
before we know it.

23:29.324 --> 23:30.867
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.048
Doogie, Rip Tide, Channel 6.
A moment, please.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.050
Uh... Sure.

23:47.050 --> 23:48.218
<i>Yeah!</i>

23:48.218 --> 23:50.387
<i>This is Rip Tide, outside Oahu Medical,</i>

23:50.387 --> 23:53.557
<i>here with 16-year-old
Dr. Lahela Kamealoha.</i>

23:53.557 --> 23:57.018
<i>Doc, is it true that you were
just relieved of your duties?</i>

23:58.687 --> 24:01.982
<i>Uh... Yes, I have. How did you know that?</i>

24:01.982 --> 24:05.652
<i>A source told me you were suspended
for saving the life of this boy's dog.</i>

24:05.652 --> 24:07.195
That is true.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.072
<i>What's the dog's name, kid?</i>

24:09.072 --> 24:12.784
<i>Pickles and Dr. Kamealoha
fixed her leg up real good.</i>

24:12.784 --> 24:15.579
Now, why did you bring her here
to a human hospital?

24:15.579 --> 24:19.666
Um, because my family can't afford
to take her to the vet.

24:19.666 --> 24:20.959
But she's okay now.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.545
I just hope Lahela gets her job back.

24:23.545 --> 24:25.964
Dr. Hannon,
you're the new chief of staff here.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.674
What do you have to say about this?

24:27.674 --> 24:30.969
While I don't condone
what Dr. Kamealoha did,

24:31.761 --> 24:33.889
I do admire her bravery

24:33.889 --> 24:37.058
and her commitment to every member
of this community.

24:37.058 --> 24:41.438
You can teach someone medicine,
but you can't teach compassion.

24:41.438 --> 24:44.107
And Lahela's got that in spades.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.319
<i>That's what makes
Oahu Medical Special.</i>

24:47.319 --> 24:49.654
<i>We're a hospital that cares.</i>

24:49.654 --> 24:54.034
<i>And as chief of staff,
I trust that the board will agree.</i>

24:55.827 --> 24:58.038
<i>This is Rip Tide reporting live.</i>

24:58.038 --> 25:01.291
<i>Coming up, was that Tom Cruise
I saw at the supermarket</i>

25:01.291 --> 25:03.502
<i>or just an attractive short man?</i>

25:03.502 --> 25:04.961
Okay. Leroy, we gotta roll.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.421
Some turkey through a bottle
of bubble bath

25:06.421 --> 25:08.048
in the seal tank at the aquarium.

25:10.592 --> 25:11.593
Wait.

25:12.260 --> 25:13.512
Did you do this?

25:14.596 --> 25:17.140
Someone had to put pressure
on the board to make them see

25:17.140 --> 25:20.477
running a hospital
shouldn't be about just the numbers.

25:20.477 --> 25:21.728
It's about people.

25:22.312 --> 25:25.440
Money should never stop us
from being compassionate.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.776
You helped remind me of that.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.195
Thanks, Mom.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.490
Way to be the change.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.659
Hi, Pickle.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.619
Oh, my goodness.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.788
Oh, you're just so sweet.

25:43.583 --> 25:47.170
This little escapade of yours
has the phones ringing off the hook.

25:47.170 --> 25:51.007
So we are prepared to offer you
a second chance.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.135
- Thank you.
- But there are conditions.

25:54.427 --> 25:58.265
Absolute compliance with the rules
and policies of this hospital.

25:58.723 --> 26:02.060
No more talks to the press, either of you.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.814
Just sign this
and we'll put an end to this matter.

26:15.532 --> 26:16.533
No.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.618
What do you mean, no?

26:18.618 --> 26:21.454
Only if you are going
to meet my conditions.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.248
Which would be?

26:23.999 --> 26:26.835
- Five million dollars.
- What?

26:26.835 --> 26:29.421
I think all this media attention
has gone to her head.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.131
It's not for me.

26:32.048 --> 26:35.260
I want this hospital to set up
a treatment fund for the uninsured.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.637
So that we can take care of those
who really need it

26:37.637 --> 26:41.474
and so that my mom can make this
the hospital she wants it to be.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.143
What a wonderful idea.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.978
But I'm afraid that that's impossible.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.938
We're barely in the black as it is.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.651
Where are you going?

26:52.611 --> 26:56.489
<i>Good Morning America</i> and <i>2020</i>
have already called asking for interviews.

26:56.489 --> 26:58.199
- So...
- Now just a second.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.285
I will not let this girl blackmail us.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.412
I have another term for it.

27:02.412 --> 27:03.455
Good PR.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.916
And I already know it's a brilliant idea.

27:06.916 --> 27:09.836
A move like this would increase
our charitable donations.

27:09.836 --> 27:12.422
I've gotten four calls
already this morning.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.387
All right.

27:19.387 --> 27:22.390
We'll go along with your idea
to create a fund for the uninsured.

27:22.390 --> 27:25.226
But remember,
it's for creatures who walk upright.

27:25.852 --> 27:26.895
Yes, ma'am.

27:31.483 --> 27:34.027
Welcome back, Dr. Kamealoha.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.528
Thanks, Mom.

27:47.791 --> 27:52.045
Thank you to everyone for coming out
for Uncle John's birthday.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.755
No problem, Dad.

27:55.548 --> 27:59.761
I'm not much of a public speaker,
so I wrote down some things to say.

27:59.761 --> 28:03.598
But those notecards dissolved
in my pocket already.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.935
So I'm just going to speak from the heart.

28:09.896 --> 28:12.065
It's really hard for me
to lose Uncle John.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.901
And he was the one that taught me--

28:21.449 --> 28:23.743
Um, as I was saying,

28:23.743 --> 28:26.204
Uncle John, he taught me everything.

28:28.456 --> 28:30.458
- Kai.
- What?

28:30.875 --> 28:32.502
Uncle John would have loved this.

28:32.502 --> 28:34.713
Busting Dad's chops
was his favorite thing to do.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.548
It's true.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.093
He would have loved nothing more
than to see me knocked on my butt

28:40.093 --> 28:41.803
when I'm trying to be poetic.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.472
It makes me feel like
he's right here with us.

28:44.472 --> 28:46.725
Like he'll always be here with us.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.395
To Uncle John.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.605
