08:13.663 --> 08:16.576
[Chip]
That was them!
Let's go, people!

08:16.576 --> 08:19.289
Works every time-- Aah!

08:19.289 --> 08:20.670
Gloria, I've got a plan.

08:20.670 --> 08:22.212
Which way to the
Silverway Bridge?

08:22.212 --> 08:24.084
I told you,
it's always gridlocked.

08:24.084 --> 08:26.086
Gloria, give this
country boy a chance.

08:26.086 --> 08:28.508
Ugh! Fine!
Left at the light.

08:32.432 --> 08:33.683
-[Chip] Surprise!
-[both] Aah!

08:33.683 --> 08:35.595
I'll take those.

08:35.595 --> 08:37.097
-[Gloria] Hey!
-[both grunting]

08:37.097 --> 08:38.188
Gloria!

08:38.188 --> 08:39.729
What's a city girl like you

08:39.729 --> 08:41.601
doing with this
country bumpkin, anyway?

08:41.601 --> 08:43.773
Actually, why don't
you come work for me

08:43.773 --> 08:45.775
-at Wholesome Foods?
-Huh?

08:45.775 --> 08:48.858
-Watch out! Median!
-[Chip, Gloria] Whoa!

08:48.858 --> 08:51.781
Come on! City people
should stick together.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.822
We're almost to the bridge!

08:52.822 --> 08:54.654
So, what do you say,
Gloria?

08:54.654 --> 08:56.786
Sorry, Chip.
I'm no city girl.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.208
I'm from the suburbs.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.159
Whoa!

08:59.159 --> 09:01.081
-[grunts]
-Oof!

09:01.081 --> 09:02.582
[groaning]

09:02.582 --> 09:05.085
Aah! My tooth!

09:05.085 --> 09:06.796
My tooth!

09:06.796 --> 09:08.048
[laughs] Nice!

09:08.048 --> 09:09.299
Where'd you learn that?

09:09.299 --> 09:10.760
Youth soccer.

09:10.760 --> 09:11.801
Cricket, the traffic!

09:11.801 --> 09:13.303
I know. Hyah!

09:13.303 --> 09:14.724
Quick, after them!

09:15.885 --> 09:16.936
We're not gonna make it!

09:16.936 --> 09:18.268
[Gloria]
It's too narrow!

09:18.268 --> 09:20.680
We're gonna make it!
Hyah!

09:20.680 --> 09:23.143
Yah! Yah! Ha ha!

09:23.143 --> 09:24.354
Woo-hoo!

09:25.355 --> 09:27.397
[drivers clamoring]

09:27.397 --> 09:28.738
Bingo bango.

09:28.738 --> 09:30.110
We did it!

09:30.110 --> 09:31.361
[both]
Whew!

09:36.156 --> 09:37.787
Pretty cool bridge.

09:37.787 --> 09:39.789
Yeah, it ain't bad.

09:39.789 --> 09:41.911
One of these days,
Cricket Green,

09:41.911 --> 09:44.504
I'm gonna run your family
out of this town!

09:44.504 --> 09:45.875
Mark my words!

09:45.875 --> 09:48.298
Big City is no place
for the Greens!

09:48.298 --> 09:49.839
I don't think
he can hear you.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.921
-Like, they're already gone.
-Shut up, Greg!

09:53.343 --> 09:54.804
And then she kicked the bag
out of his hands,

09:54.804 --> 09:57.016
and he was all like,
"Aah! My 'toof'!"

09:57.016 --> 09:58.518
And he starts
weaving past cars

09:58.518 --> 09:59.889
like, "Zoom,
zoom, zoom!"

09:59.889 --> 10:01.681
She was like some kind of
superhero or something!

10:01.681 --> 10:02.892
-[Ms. Cho grunts]
-[Gloria] You were, too!

10:02.892 --> 10:05.225
-[grunts]
-Huh? What's this?

10:05.225 --> 10:06.396
I paid off my debt?

10:06.396 --> 10:07.687
Oh, right.

10:07.687 --> 10:09.149
I guess I don't
work here anymore.

10:09.149 --> 10:10.730
[Ms. Cho]
Mm-hmm.

10:10.730 --> 10:13.903
Cool. Well, I guess
you're free then.

10:13.903 --> 10:15.735
Yeah... [chuckles]
So are you.

10:15.735 --> 10:18.448
Great. We got what
we wanted. [chuckles]

10:18.448 --> 10:21.040
So, uh, I guess
this is goodbye.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.834
-Huh?
-[cup shatters]

10:24.834 --> 10:26.876
-Cricket!
-What? That was you!

10:26.876 --> 10:29.249
-I didn't do--
-Cricket, cut it out!

10:29.249 --> 10:31.511
Oh! I get it.

10:31.511 --> 10:32.842
Hmm?

10:32.842 --> 10:34.714
-[items crashing]
-[angry grunt]

10:34.714 --> 10:38.518
Whoopsies!
Did I get a debt again?

10:38.518 --> 10:40.350
Ms. Cho, I tried
to stop him!

10:40.350 --> 10:41.851
Destructive scamp!

10:41.851 --> 10:43.433
[angry grunt]

10:43.433 --> 10:45.935
Woo-hoo! The dream team
is back together.

10:45.935 --> 10:47.687
Aw, yeah!

10:47.687 --> 10:49.479
With that level
of property damage,

10:49.479 --> 10:50.860
you're gonna work here forever.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.362
Woo-hoo! Forever!

10:52.362 --> 10:54.073
[chuckles] Forever.

10:54.073 --> 10:56.776
[chuckles] Wow.

10:56.776 --> 10:58.328
[both chuckling nervously]

10:58.328 --> 10:59.739
[both sigh]

11:03.163 --> 11:05.785
All right, I think I've
lined up the perfect shot.

11:05.785 --> 11:07.497
Okay, it's ready!

11:07.497 --> 11:09.629
Remember, Cricket,
you aim with your eye,

11:09.629 --> 11:11.090
but you shoot
with your heart.

11:11.090 --> 11:12.382
-Cricket!
-Aah!

11:12.382 --> 11:13.593
Almost, Cricket!

11:13.593 --> 11:14.964
Cricket,
what are you doing?

11:14.964 --> 11:16.506
You're supposed to be
brushing the dog.

11:16.506 --> 11:18.298
The old girl's
shedding like crazy!

11:18.298 --> 11:19.929
[coughs]

11:19.929 --> 11:21.391
Dad, I'm busy.

11:21.391 --> 11:22.852
She's your responsibility,

11:22.852 --> 11:24.974
and I've been asking you
to do it for days.

11:24.974 --> 11:26.396
[sighs] All right, fine.

11:26.396 --> 11:28.147
Your turn, Remy.
Don't shoot your eye out.

11:28.147 --> 11:29.899
-Okay.
-All right, Phoenix.

11:29.899 --> 11:31.070
Here comes
a good brushing.

11:31.070 --> 11:32.362
Three brushes
ought to do it.

11:32.362 --> 11:35.154
One... [grunting]

11:35.154 --> 11:36.946
-[glass breaks]
-[Remy] Aah! My eye!

11:36.946 --> 11:39.739
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Remy, I'm coming!

11:39.739 --> 11:41.821
I love you.

11:41.821 --> 11:43.583
[sniffing]

11:46.746 --> 11:47.787
Hey, do you think
this thing would work

11:47.787 --> 11:49.088
if we loaded it up
with turnips?

11:49.088 --> 11:50.750
I don't know.
Let's find out.

11:50.750 --> 11:51.831
-[Phoenix sniffing]
-[Remy, Cricket laughing]

11:51.831 --> 11:53.543
[inquisitive bark]

11:53.543 --> 11:55.174
[resumes sniffing]

11:57.797 --> 12:01.050
[Bill]
Cricket, have you
fed the dog yet?

12:01.050 --> 12:02.762
[Cricket]
I'm doing it!

12:04.304 --> 12:06.476
Come on, Phoenix!
[whistling]

12:06.476 --> 12:09.018
That's weird.
She always comes running
when she hears her food.

12:09.018 --> 12:10.730
And by running,
I mean waddling.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.232
Boy, oh, boy, is she old!

12:12.232 --> 12:14.984
[laughs]

12:14.984 --> 12:16.656
-Let's go find her.
-We should probably
go look for her.

12:16.656 --> 12:17.737
Phoenix!

12:17.737 --> 12:18.988
Phoenix!

12:18.988 --> 12:20.029
Come here, girl!

12:20.029 --> 12:21.200
[grunting]

12:21.200 --> 12:22.822
Dang head's getting bigger.

12:22.822 --> 12:24.203
Well, she ain't
on the roof neither.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.956
Cricket, I'm starting
to worry about Phoenix.

12:26.956 --> 12:29.208
Do you think
she's okay?

12:29.208 --> 12:30.830
Oh, yeah,
she just wandered off.

12:30.830 --> 12:33.042
She used to do this
all the time in the country.

12:33.042 --> 12:35.295
What if she's out in the city
and can't find her way home?

12:35.295 --> 12:37.927
Nah, she and I have
a special connection.

12:37.927 --> 12:40.049
Like an owner-pet
psychic link.

12:40.049 --> 12:42.051
I'll be able to find her
anywhere. Let's go!

12:42.051 --> 12:44.594
-Phoenix! Come here, girl!
-We got food for ya, Phi-Phi!

12:44.594 --> 12:45.595
Hello, have you seen
my dog, Phoenix?

12:45.595 --> 12:47.016
She's a good dog...

12:47.016 --> 12:48.688
...and well, she seems
to have wandered off,

12:48.688 --> 12:49.939
and I'm hoping you
or one of your...

12:49.939 --> 12:52.942
...work associates
may have seen her!

12:52.942 --> 12:55.605
[Tilly]
I don't understand
why she'd run off.

12:55.605 --> 12:57.317
She loves it
at our place.

12:57.317 --> 12:58.898
Why, just today
you gave her

12:58.898 --> 13:00.700
a good brushin',
didn't ya, Cricket?

13:00.700 --> 13:02.111
Yeah, kinda.

13:02.111 --> 13:03.953
Maybe she just got
a little confused.

13:03.953 --> 13:05.285
After all,
she is pretty old.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.286
How long have you had her?

13:06.286 --> 13:07.457
Oh, I've had her just about

13:07.457 --> 13:08.788
as long as I've been alive.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.789
Back in the country,

13:09.789 --> 13:11.671
when I was just a wee babe,

13:11.671 --> 13:13.623
<i> one summer night our barn
was hit by lightning</i>

13:13.623 --> 13:15.335
<i>and burned right to the ground.</i>

13:15.335 --> 13:18.217
<i> Mom let me play in the ashes,
which was super fun,</i>

13:18.217 --> 13:21.921
<i> but to everyone's surprise,
she found a little black puppy.</i>

13:21.921 --> 13:24.924
<i> The pup was all alone, and by
some miracle had survived.</i>

13:24.924 --> 13:27.266
<i> And when we washed her off,
wouldn't you know it,</i>

13:27.266 --> 13:29.138
<i> she had been red
the whole time!</i>

13:29.138 --> 13:30.730
<i> My mom named her Phoenix,</i>

13:30.730 --> 13:32.101
<i> and gave her to me
as my first pet.</i>

13:32.101 --> 13:35.315
<i>Phoenix and I were inseparable.</i>

13:35.315 --> 13:36.986
<i> Goofin' off together,</i>

13:36.986 --> 13:39.068
<i> and growing up side by side.</i>

13:39.068 --> 13:40.610
We've been each other's
best friends

13:40.610 --> 13:43.703
-our entire lives.
-[chuckles] Neat story, Cricket.

13:43.703 --> 13:46.325
<i> What the heck?! I thought
I was Cricket's best friend!</i>

13:46.325 --> 13:48.117
Neat story.

13:48.117 --> 13:50.119
-[Phoenix barking]
-[gasps] That sounds like

13:50.119 --> 13:51.080
Phoenix!

13:51.080 --> 13:52.412
[sniffing]

13:52.412 --> 13:53.953
See, I told you
we'd find her.

13:53.953 --> 13:55.415
She just got a little lost,
is all.

13:55.415 --> 13:56.756
Phoenix!

13:56.756 --> 13:58.217
Wha-- Hey, where you going?

13:58.217 --> 14:00.129
[barks]

14:00.129 --> 14:01.381
-Phoenix?
-[Phoenix barks]

14:01.381 --> 14:02.512
Phoenix!

14:02.512 --> 14:04.424
[panting] Wait!

14:06.386 --> 14:07.387
Phoenix!

14:07.387 --> 14:09.599
Phoenix, don't go!

14:09.599 --> 14:10.970
[panting, barks]

14:10.970 --> 14:12.562
[panting]

14:12.562 --> 14:14.394
What's the matter
with her?

14:14.394 --> 14:16.025
Uh, I don't know.
It's like she

14:16.025 --> 14:17.236
couldn't get away
from me fast enough.

14:17.236 --> 14:19.068
Did I do
something wrong?

14:19.068 --> 14:21.360
Did we lose our
owner-pet psychic link?

14:21.360 --> 14:24.033
Does Phoenix not
like me anymore?

14:24.033 --> 14:26.195
[light buzzing]

14:26.195 --> 14:27.987
Cricket, it's
getting late.

14:27.987 --> 14:31.701
Yeah, maybe we should get
Papa and Gramma's help?

14:31.701 --> 14:33.372
[sighs] Yeah, okay.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.164
[Cricket]
I messed up real bad, Dad.

14:35.164 --> 14:37.417
I had a good,
sweet pupper,
and now she's gone.

14:37.417 --> 14:39.839
Aww, don't beat
yourself up, son.

14:39.839 --> 14:41.380
With all of us out there
searching for her,

14:41.380 --> 14:43.132
we'll find Phoenix
no matter what.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.965
Well, let's not make
any promises you can't keep.

14:45.965 --> 14:47.216
Ma, come on.

14:47.216 --> 14:49.969
[Cricket]
Phoenix!

14:49.969 --> 14:52.221
Phoenix!

14:52.221 --> 14:55.975
Come on, girl, where are ya?

14:59.148 --> 15:00.860
[sighs]

15:00.860 --> 15:02.902
You okay, son?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.734
Nope. I'm a bad seed, Dad.

15:04.734 --> 15:07.286
Time to return me to whatever
baby farm you got me from,

15:07.286 --> 15:08.828
and pick out a new boy.

15:08.828 --> 15:10.660
Uh, that's not how it works.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.162
[clears throat] Remember
when you were little, Cricket?

15:13.162 --> 15:15.495
<i> You would try to ride Phoenix
like a little horse.</i>

15:15.495 --> 15:17.246
<i> [chuckles]
She didn't like it much,</i>

15:17.246 --> 15:19.038
<i> but that didn't
stop you from trying.</i>

15:21.170 --> 15:23.252
I remember when
I was little...

15:23.252 --> 15:24.423
<i> ...and couldn't sleep.</i>

15:24.423 --> 15:25.925
<i> I'd curl up with Phoenix</i>

15:25.925 --> 15:27.006
<i> in her dog bed...</i>

15:27.006 --> 15:29.048
<i> and we'd share her treats.</i>

15:29.048 --> 15:31.551
[laughs] Remember
that, Cricket?

15:31.551 --> 15:33.052
And I remember when--

15:33.052 --> 15:34.604
Yeah, good story, Remy.

15:34.604 --> 15:36.355
I don't care much
for her yappin',

15:36.355 --> 15:38.478
but you know,
it's nice having someone

15:38.478 --> 15:40.269
in the house older than me.

15:40.269 --> 15:41.901
In dog years, anyway.

15:41.901 --> 15:43.152
[laughs] Yeah!

15:43.152 --> 15:44.153
Hey, you got any good

15:44.153 --> 15:45.234
Phoenix stories,
Cricket?

15:45.234 --> 15:47.276
Well, there was this one time.

15:47.276 --> 15:49.238
<i> I went out to the woods
to dig a hole.</i>

15:49.238 --> 15:51.491
<i> Last summer I was really
into digging holes.</i>

15:51.491 --> 15:53.032
I love digging holes!

15:53.032 --> 15:55.284
<i> I was gonna dig
my deepest hole yet...</i>

15:55.284 --> 15:56.996
<i> and I succeeded!</i>

15:56.996 --> 15:59.038
<i> Actually succeeded too well,</i>

15:59.038 --> 16:00.129
<i> and got myself stuck.</i>

16:00.129 --> 16:03.042
Help!

16:03.042 --> 16:05.174
<i> I was stuck in that dang hole
for hours!</i>

16:05.174 --> 16:06.215
<i> Until...</i>

16:06.215 --> 16:08.347
[Phoenix barking]

16:08.347 --> 16:09.889
<i> Phoenix arrived!</i>

16:09.889 --> 16:11.681
Phoenix, I'm so
happy to see ya!

16:11.681 --> 16:14.093
Go find help, girl! Go!

16:14.093 --> 16:15.685
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

16:15.685 --> 16:17.186
[groans]

16:17.186 --> 16:18.477
<i> She never was
the brightest dog.</i>

16:18.477 --> 16:20.149
<i> But she sure was the sweetest.</i>

16:20.149 --> 16:21.731
[laughs]
You remember that, Dad?

16:21.731 --> 16:23.402
I thought I'd lost my boy.

16:23.402 --> 16:24.984
How'd you end up
finding us, anyway?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.365
Well...
[clears throat]

16:26.365 --> 16:28.367
Phoenix shed so much
that she left

16:28.367 --> 16:29.569
a fur trail
right to you.

16:29.569 --> 16:31.240
We just followed the trail.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.743
You followed a trail of fur?

16:33.743 --> 16:35.374
[gasps] Dad,
turn this truck around!

16:35.374 --> 16:36.876
I know where we gotta go!

16:36.876 --> 16:38.327
Come on! We have to see

16:38.327 --> 16:39.418
if there's still a trail.

16:39.418 --> 16:41.420
Look! Phoenix's fur!

16:41.420 --> 16:42.622
She's not gone yet!

16:42.622 --> 16:44.714
-Let's go!
-All right!

16:44.714 --> 16:46.085
More fur this way!

16:46.085 --> 16:47.336
[all cheer]

16:47.336 --> 16:48.888
I found dog prints!

16:48.888 --> 16:50.339
-Woo-hoo!
-Yeah!

16:50.339 --> 16:52.471
Uh, I think this is hers.

16:52.471 --> 16:53.893
-You bet it is!
-[both] Yeah!

16:53.893 --> 16:57.096
Fur trail ends right here.

16:57.096 --> 16:58.137
Well, what are
y'all waiting for?

16:58.137 --> 16:59.138
She's gotta be in there!

17:00.439 --> 17:02.231
-Ugh!
-Sorry, kid.

17:02.231 --> 17:04.604
-Bikers only.
-What? Get outta my way!

17:04.604 --> 17:07.106
-I'm going in there!
-Cricket, stop!

17:07.106 --> 17:09.819
Let me talk to him
man to man.

17:09.819 --> 17:13.032
Listen, pal, you're gonna
let my boy in, or else.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.153
Or else what?

17:14.153 --> 17:15.154
Or else...

17:15.154 --> 17:16.866
Nothing. Listen,
I'm not a fighter.

17:16.866 --> 17:18.537
I just wanna look tough
in front of my boy.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.829
Thanks for the
distraction, Dad.

17:19.829 --> 17:20.960
-What?
-Cricket!

17:20.960 --> 17:23.122
-Phoenix!
-[all grumble]

17:23.122 --> 17:25.214
-Hey, get back here!
-Phoenix?

17:25.214 --> 17:27.967
-Phoenix?
-No, my name's Randy.

17:27.967 --> 17:29.929
Phoenix, where are you, girl?

17:29.929 --> 17:31.340
-Come on out!
-Aah!

17:31.340 --> 17:33.843
Cricket, come back!

17:33.843 --> 17:35.514
-[bikers grumbling]
-Aah!

17:35.514 --> 17:36.976
Mm.

17:36.976 --> 17:39.599
What do you think
you're doing here, kid?

17:39.599 --> 17:42.311
This place is
for bikers only.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.392
What am I doing here?

17:43.392 --> 17:45.144
I'll tell ya
what I'm doing here.

17:45.144 --> 17:46.816
I'm looking for my dog!

17:46.816 --> 17:47.947
She's lost.

17:47.947 --> 17:49.318
Or maybe--

17:49.318 --> 17:50.990
maybe she ran away.

17:50.990 --> 17:53.322
Maybe she ran away
because I took her for granted.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.995
I didn't always pay her
the attention she deserved.

17:55.995 --> 17:58.618
Maybe not brushing her today
was the final straw.

17:58.618 --> 18:00.409
But if I could just find her,

18:00.409 --> 18:01.911
and show her that I love her,

18:01.911 --> 18:03.793
maybe she'd wanna
stay with me again.

18:03.793 --> 18:08.087
[bikers crying]

18:08.087 --> 18:10.209
Nothing's as pure
as the relationship

18:10.209 --> 18:12.171
between a kid
and their dog.

18:12.171 --> 18:14.473
I remember my first dog!

18:14.473 --> 18:16.095
This makes me
sad and angry

18:16.095 --> 18:17.767
and I don't know
how to deal with that!

18:17.767 --> 18:19.388
[frustrated grunt]

18:19.388 --> 18:21.220
So, what's
your dog like?

18:21.220 --> 18:22.682
Well, she's hard
to put into words,

18:22.682 --> 18:25.024
but if I had to,
I'd say majestic,

18:25.024 --> 18:26.646
-spry, and beautiful.
-[needle buzzing]

18:26.646 --> 18:28.938
Does your dog
look like this?

18:28.938 --> 18:32.071
No, sorry. I probably
should've described her
physically.

18:32.071 --> 18:33.613
She's mostly
old and red.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.075
Old and red?
There was a dog like that

18:36.075 --> 18:37.947
whimpering
outside earlier.

18:37.947 --> 18:39.328
[gasps] Yes!
Yes, that's her!

18:39.328 --> 18:40.539
Where is she?

18:40.539 --> 18:42.041
Well, somebody
took the dog.

18:42.041 --> 18:43.122
She's gone now.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.084
Wait, what?

18:45.084 --> 18:46.626
I can't believe it.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.377
Phoenix was dog-napped?

18:48.377 --> 18:50.379
She could be anywhere
in the city by now.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.802
Or even farther!

18:52.802 --> 18:54.213
I'm sorry, Cricket.

18:54.213 --> 18:55.254
The trail ends here.

18:58.097 --> 18:59.809
[sighs] Hey, bud.

18:59.809 --> 19:01.470
We're gonna make posters,

19:01.470 --> 19:04.063
and we're gonna keep
lookin', but it's late.

19:04.063 --> 19:05.725
We'll start first thing
in the morning.

19:05.725 --> 19:06.936
It'll be okay.

19:06.936 --> 19:09.108
[Cricket crying]

19:09.108 --> 19:10.730
[crying]

19:10.730 --> 19:12.031
Oh, Phoenix.

19:12.031 --> 19:13.482

19:13.482 --> 19:17.116
[Cricket, Tilly crying]

19:17.116 --> 19:18.197
[Remy whimpers]

19:18.197 --> 19:19.578
She's gone, and it's--

19:19.578 --> 19:21.490
it's my fault.

19:21.490 --> 19:23.452
And I should've--

19:23.452 --> 19:25.494
I should've brushed her
like you said.

19:25.494 --> 19:27.336
[crying]

19:27.336 --> 19:28.457
Oh, come on, boy.

19:28.457 --> 19:30.960
There's no...
sense in crying.

19:30.960 --> 19:34.553
[crying]

19:39.138 --> 19:41.260
Son, are you
gonna be okay?

19:41.260 --> 19:43.893
I just can't believe
Phoenix is gone.

19:43.893 --> 19:46.355
It's almost as if I can
still hear her barking.

19:46.355 --> 19:50.189
Well, son, sometimes
when we lose someone we love,

19:50.189 --> 19:51.691
it's as if we<i> can
</i>still hear th--

19:51.691 --> 19:53.572
No, I hear her barking!

19:53.572 --> 19:55.114
I'm coming, Phoenix!

19:55.114 --> 19:56.115
[Bill groans]

19:56.115 --> 19:58.317
Phoenix? Phoenix!

19:58.317 --> 20:01.280
Oh, great. The boy's
got sorrow madness.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.661
Phoenix, I'm sorry!

20:02.661 --> 20:04.323
I should've cared more.

20:04.323 --> 20:06.455
I-- I should've noticed
when you wandered off.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.328
I promise I'll always
appreciate you and brush you

20:09.328 --> 20:12.041
and feed you and brush you,
and do anything you need!

20:12.041 --> 20:14.503
So, please,
just come home, Phoenix!

20:18.387 --> 20:19.839
[panting, barks]

20:19.839 --> 20:21.340

20:21.340 --> 20:22.511
Well, I'll be!

20:22.511 --> 20:24.263

Oh, Phoenix! I love you,
I love you, I love you!

20:26.936 --> 20:29.268
-Phoenix!
-Wowie Zowie!

20:29.268 --> 20:30.269
Oh, I missed you
so much, girl!

20:30.269 --> 20:31.350
-Good girl!
-Good dog!

20:31.350 --> 20:32.351
[Gramma]
That's a good dog.

20:32.351 --> 20:33.943
You're gonna get
so many brushes.

20:33.943 --> 20:35.354
I'm gonna
brush you silly.

20:35.354 --> 20:37.907
From now on, I'll always
enjoy our time together.

20:37.907 --> 20:39.158
[Phoenix choking]

20:39.158 --> 20:40.359
Sorry!
Too much, too much.

20:40.359 --> 20:42.361
Friends?
[laughs]

20:42.361 --> 20:45.494
Pretty odd for Phoenix to
just disappear like that.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.535
Yeah, I wonder
where she went.

20:46.535 --> 20:48.537
I guess
we'll never know.

-[motorcycle humming]
-[Cricket] Huh?

21:17.156 --> 21:19.158
Looks like somebody
lost their dog.

21:19.158 --> 21:20.399
Good thing she tracked me down.

21:20.399 --> 21:23.572
Well, look who finally
got out of jail.

Hey, kiddos.
