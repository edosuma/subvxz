WEBVTT

00:15.056 --> 00:16.683
Konoha.

00:16.766 --> 00:19.686
This is my first arrest. I'm so nervous.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.980
Under arrest?

00:22.063 --> 00:23.314
Touya Sagami.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.568
I am arresting you for a flagrant offense.

00:27.152 --> 00:30.029
Well, you have the right to remain silent

00:30.530 --> 00:32.991
and the right
to retain a legal affairs AI.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.702
What are you doing?

00:35.785 --> 00:37.037
Settle down!

00:37.120 --> 00:40.457
Stop!
How are you allowed to arrest people?

00:40.540 --> 00:42.917
It's a flagrant offense--
a violation of Article 82.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.253
Never heard of it!

00:45.336 --> 00:47.046
Bright!

00:49.382 --> 00:50.925
Damn it. My breathing--

00:51.551 --> 00:53.052
Why is it so cold?

00:53.720 --> 00:54.763
An accident.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.390
That's right.
There was some kind of an accident.

00:59.559 --> 01:03.605
Hello? Mina?
Please pull yourself together.

01:03.688 --> 01:05.648
EPISODE 2: MIST AND DARKNESS

01:08.151 --> 01:09.611
It's pitch black.

01:09.694 --> 01:12.405
Mina, are you hurt?

01:13.823 --> 01:15.283
Are you okay?

01:17.202 --> 01:18.578
Ouch.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.413
Are you okay?

01:20.497 --> 01:24.250
Nasa. Nasa Houston.
Can you hear me?

01:24.918 --> 01:26.252
-Houston?
-Houston?

01:27.253 --> 01:28.671
Nasa.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.965
Nasa, are you okay?

01:31.049 --> 01:34.719
-Are you hurt?
-I remember. She protected us.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.514
Oh, no! Well--

01:37.597 --> 01:39.682
Nasa! Houston!

01:40.809 --> 01:42.018
Oh, no.

01:42.101 --> 01:45.271
This is so bad. Is she dead?

01:45.355 --> 01:48.566
She's breathing and has a heartbeat.
She is alive.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.443
Thank goodness.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.362
Nasa!

01:52.904 --> 01:54.864
What should we do?

01:54.948 --> 01:59.160
I'm requesting instructions from
the medical cloud, but cannot connect.

01:59.244 --> 02:03.039
No, call somebody. Maybe the police.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.625
The entire Internet is disconnected.

02:05.708 --> 02:09.754
Well, I don't really understand.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.382
But we'll be saved, won't we?

02:13.716 --> 02:15.593
I don't know.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.471
No, no, no.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.390
OUT OF RANGE

02:21.683 --> 02:24.769
Didn't they say it was safe?
That's why I came.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.604
What do we do?

02:26.688 --> 02:28.231
Nasa!

02:28.314 --> 02:29.983
I'm cold.

02:30.942 --> 02:31.943
My ears hurt.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.696
It's decompressing.

02:34.779 --> 02:38.700
If we don't hurry up and evacuate
to the shelter, we will suffocate and die.

02:38.783 --> 02:42.203
Shelter? Where is it?

02:43.496 --> 02:45.582
Bright! Twelve!

02:49.502 --> 02:51.921
Don't puke!
Don't you dare puke all over me!

02:52.547 --> 02:54.215
Slow down your breathing.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.929
-Feeling better?
-Yes. I apologize.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.266
Okay.
Now it's about time you got off of me.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.768
Please don't get violent.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.938
The shelter should be nearby.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.231
Which way?

03:10.315 --> 03:12.817
If we follow the wall, we'll get there.

03:13.735 --> 03:14.986
Got it.

03:16.738 --> 03:17.739
Ouch.

03:17.822 --> 03:20.158
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.121
It's not my fault.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.624
It's gravity's fault.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.293
The atmospheric pressure is dropping.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.212
There's a breach.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.346
We need to get away
before we run out of air.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.473
I don't think we'll run out of it
right away.

03:43.556 --> 03:44.682
We won't?

03:48.811 --> 03:52.357
Mina, I am about to stop functioning.

03:52.440 --> 03:56.236
Soon,
this elevator will descend automatically.

03:56.319 --> 03:59.322
Don't give up. Go get helpâ€¦

03:59.989 --> 04:00.990
Twelve.

04:01.908 --> 04:02.909
Twelve!

04:04.953 --> 04:07.413
Excuse me.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.457
Operator.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.834
Hello?

04:12.335 --> 04:14.837
Well, we're in trouble.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.382
No way.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.301
Anybody! Are there any adults around?

04:20.385 --> 04:22.762
-Someone save us!
-Help!

04:28.184 --> 04:29.936
It's dropping.

04:30.019 --> 04:31.437
It's okay.

04:31.521 --> 04:35.650
Twelve said
this elevator will descend automatically.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.151
Ouch.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.736
Nasa!

04:39.320 --> 04:41.489
-Ouch.
-Thank goodness!

04:42.240 --> 04:45.994
I don't think this was written
in the <i>Seven Poem</i>.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.413
The shelter.

04:49.497 --> 04:50.915
Which one?

04:51.708 --> 04:52.875
This.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.671
Where?

04:56.754 --> 04:59.048
It's cold. Hurry up and open it.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.426
Tell me in a way I can understand.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.512
You arrested the wrong person.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.975
-I'm requesting a legal affairs AI.
-What?

05:09.058 --> 05:12.103
Restraint without the presence
of a legal affairs AI is prohibited.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.813
Bright is a legal affairs AI.

05:13.896 --> 05:18.568
Then call him. If he is not present,
I'll sue you for unlawful restraint.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.673
Isn't there a heater?

05:40.757 --> 05:43.217
You should just be thankful for oxygen.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.763
I hate space. It's dark.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.182
Can't we make a call from this panel?

05:49.265 --> 05:52.435
Not possible.
This shelter is incomplete as well.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.896
-Unbelievable.
-Oh, yeah.

05:57.231 --> 05:59.901
There's some cold-protection gear
around here.

06:00.735 --> 06:01.861
Found it!

06:05.323 --> 06:07.575
So warm!

06:08.284 --> 06:09.911
What about for me?

06:09.994 --> 06:11.871
There was only enough for one.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.456
That doesn't make sense.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.626
This place is under construction.
It hasn't been completely equipped.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.128
That's absurd!

06:19.212 --> 06:22.465
That's because it went bankrupt once
and the management changed.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.176
-There have been delays.
-I'm coming in.

06:25.259 --> 06:27.637
-What are you doing?
-Emergency shelter.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.764
Stop! Don't pull on it.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.268
RESPECT OTHERS AND BE CONSIDERATE
IN THIS TIGHT SPACE

06:34.352 --> 06:35.645
Ready, go.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.524
-It opened!
-Nasa!

06:40.233 --> 06:41.818
Ouch.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.028
-It's so cold!
-I can't see anything.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.826
Let's huddle together.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.702
Follow along the wall.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.162
Where is the shelter?

06:53.246 --> 06:54.664
Ouch!

06:54.747 --> 06:56.958
Hiroshi, don't hold on so tight.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.669
-Idiot.
-This is why I hate kids.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.295
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.674
Don't apologize.
I don't hate kids that much.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.385
KONOHA, ARE YOU SAFE? REPLY.
MESSAGE FAILED TO SEND

07:07.969 --> 07:09.303
Ko-ko-ro-ha?

07:09.387 --> 07:10.596
Don't look!

07:11.264 --> 07:14.725
Koko-ha? Konoha? Which is it?

07:14.809 --> 07:16.394
I said don't look!

07:18.312 --> 07:21.649
If there's a breach,
does that mean we're gonna die?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.111
This station has a stop-gap function
for patching breaches.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.612
YOU ARE IN THE A CYLINDER

07:26.696 --> 07:29.073
But it might not be properly working.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.075
FULL MAP - A CYLINDER

07:31.159 --> 07:34.287
Furthermore, during an accident like this,
the station is supposed to stop rotating.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.372
That doesn't work either.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.916
What are you trying to say?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.086
-It could be terrorism.
-Yeah?

07:42.170 --> 07:44.964
As a UN2 employee,
I can't overlook the possibility.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.925
What are you looking for?

07:48.009 --> 07:51.095
There's supposed to be a printed manual
in the shelter.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.847
Placing your hopes on paper?

07:53.473 --> 07:56.350
This is bad. The air is getting thinner.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.144
Here it is.

07:59.854 --> 08:00.855
Where?

08:00.938 --> 08:03.316
There's a manual.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.360
Nasa!

08:06.861 --> 08:09.322
Nasa! Don't die yet!

08:09.405 --> 08:11.199
No, this is awful!

08:11.282 --> 08:13.284
I can see her breath. She's alive.

08:13.367 --> 08:16.037
Nasa! Where is the shelter?

08:16.120 --> 08:18.414
Nasa! Wake up!

08:20.208 --> 08:21.417
This might be it.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.587
All we can do is sit still and wait.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.882
No, we'll escape. We have to move.

08:28.424 --> 08:33.012
We Japanese don't get frantic and agitated
in situations like this.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.931
The opposite is true in zombie movies.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.642
The guys who sit still die.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.894
Zombies are irrelevant right now.

08:40.978 --> 08:42.772
I hate zombie movies.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.691
They only ever have tyrannical characters
like you in them.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.693
-You're scared of zombies.
-What?

08:48.236 --> 08:51.405
What are you saying?
I'm not afraid of them.

08:53.115 --> 08:56.327
You haven't adapted to Mars gravity yet,
have you?

08:56.911 --> 08:57.828
What?

08:57.912 --> 09:00.831
You skipped your gravity PT appointments,
didn't you?

09:00.915 --> 09:02.833
That's why you collapsed before.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.585
Shut up.

09:04.669 --> 09:08.589
Much better than spinning around
in zero gravity like you.

09:09.674 --> 09:13.094
You're the one who can't live on Earth
because of your weak condition.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.305
As if I want to go to Earth.

09:16.389 --> 09:20.768
The Japanese government is planning on
cutting back manned missions next year.

09:20.851 --> 09:21.769
What?

09:21.852 --> 09:25.523
We got an administration that is reducing
the science and technology budget.

09:25.606 --> 09:26.732
So?

09:26.816 --> 09:30.236
You keep yourself locked up in space
and won't come down to Earth.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.572
It's hard on our government.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.865
I don't know if you understand.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.702
You are a nuisance.

09:38.202 --> 09:43.958
Living and having kids in space
isn't right for humans to begin with.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.628
Are you saying I should die?

09:47.712 --> 09:49.297
No.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.091
It's just that there are a lot of people
saying that stuff.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.301
Ouch!

09:53.384 --> 09:55.886
Ouch! What are you doing? Stop!

09:56.596 --> 09:58.014
I saved you.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.767
I hate Earthers.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.645
You should all get blown into extinction
by a meteorite.

10:04.729 --> 10:08.566
You're a follower of John Doe, aren't you?

10:08.649 --> 10:09.942
What?

10:10.026 --> 10:12.778
Your drone hacked the system.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.531
Then I discovered
a cognitive-limiter violation.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.658
Right after that, this accident occurred.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.744
You don't know who you're talking to.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.079
I'm just tolerating you now,

10:22.163 --> 10:25.166
but I could report you
for suspicion of terrorism.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.209
That's ridiculous.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.671
Then why would you unlock
your cognitive limiter?

10:30.755 --> 10:34.425
-None of your business.
-Yes, it is! Explain yourself!

10:35.051 --> 10:37.386
I'm going to exterminate all you Earthers

10:37.470 --> 10:40.222
by raising a Lunatic that surpasses Seven!

10:40.306 --> 10:41.307
Happy now?

10:43.893 --> 10:46.771
How long was I unconscious?

10:46.854 --> 10:48.189
About ten minutes.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.774
Ouch!

10:49.857 --> 10:51.567
I'm so embarrassed.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.694
Don't look, you brat.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.029
Ouch!

10:55.112 --> 10:59.075
-What about painkillers?
-They're the drowsy type, aren't they?

11:00.284 --> 11:03.579
We need to get to the shuttle.
We could get left behind.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.582
-If only we stopped rotating.
-What do you mean?

11:07.166 --> 11:10.920
Normally when an accident occurs,
the active brakes will activate

11:11.003 --> 11:13.130
and zero gravity will occur.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.258
If that happened,
we could float up to the top.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.052
Is that so?

11:18.135 --> 11:21.722
Was there an ONIQLO
in any of the boxes under the floor?

11:21.806 --> 11:25.267
-ONIQLO?
-Oh, you mean an ONIQLO suit.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.854
It is a simple space suit,
just like the shuttle suits.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.981
According to the manual,
it should be around here.

11:31.065 --> 11:34.652
So if we can make it outside in that,
we can go home to Earth?

11:34.735 --> 11:38.280
It's cheap and vinyl.
You wouldn't be able to go out in it.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.490
Vinyl?

11:39.573 --> 11:42.493
-However, it's better than nothing.
-Found it!

11:43.202 --> 11:44.412
There aren't any.

11:44.495 --> 11:48.207
If we had ONIQLOs,
we could survive the cold and radiation.

11:48.290 --> 11:50.000
They left them out?

11:50.584 --> 11:52.002
Oxygen!

11:53.003 --> 11:55.214
What have you been up to?

11:55.840 --> 11:57.925
There's no Internet connection.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.220
-Peer-to-peer?
-Don't look!

12:03.472 --> 12:06.642
I'm wearing an ONIQLO now. It's warm.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.894
The gloves are Smart-equipped.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.147
It's too loose for me.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.233
If I could do a live feed of this,

12:14.316 --> 12:17.319
I might get 100 million followers.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.906
If only I could at least
get the landscape outside in a selfie.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.908
Oh, yeah. Peer-to-peer.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.453
Is peer-to-peer Internet?

12:25.536 --> 12:27.788
There has been no connection for awhile.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.832
Peer-to-peer isn't Internet.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.502
Peer-to-peer
connects devices to each other.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.881
By pairing devices,
you can get up to 200 meters--

12:36.964 --> 12:38.174
Found it!

12:39.133 --> 12:41.927
Oh, a peer comm?

12:42.470 --> 12:44.930
Like when you connect handcuffs
or a drone--

12:45.014 --> 12:47.808
Are you trying to boot up
that illegal drone?

12:47.892 --> 12:50.186
-I won't let you!
-Get off me!

12:50.269 --> 12:54.523
I'll boot up Bright first
and shut your drone down.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.318
I win!

12:57.401 --> 12:59.028
How childish.

12:59.528 --> 13:00.946
I have an image.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.699
This is-- The spa hub is directly below.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.410
Bright has paired now too.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.039
Bright. Get up.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.624
Explore the area.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.711
There are containers. ONIQLO--

13:15.794 --> 13:18.464
Found them. ONIQLO suits.

13:18.547 --> 13:21.842
But the atmospheric pressure outside
is about the same as on Mt. Fuji's summit.

13:21.926 --> 13:22.927
KONOHA, REPLY.

13:23.010 --> 13:26.305
With our current equipment,
it would be very-- Touya?

13:27.515 --> 13:29.058
You're going?

13:29.141 --> 13:30.476
That's absurd.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.228
Let's wait here for help.

13:33.687 --> 13:35.898
I won't allow you to go out there alone.

13:35.981 --> 13:36.982
It's cold!

13:38.067 --> 13:40.486
Got it. Selfie connected.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.988
Selfie, turn on your high-intensity light.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.073
EARTH GRAVITY FLOOR

13:44.156 --> 13:46.116
I can see. I wonder if there's air.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.243
AIR PRESSURE - TEMPERATURE

13:47.868 --> 13:50.204
Why can't he close the door?

13:52.289 --> 13:53.791
It's cold.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.960
There it is. An ONIQLO suit.

13:56.544 --> 14:00.381
Okay, I think it's feet in from the top.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.508
All right, got it on.

14:02.591 --> 14:05.719
Quickly.
Let's climb up and get on the shuttle.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.304
Come on, Dakky.

14:08.305 --> 14:11.642
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

14:11.725 --> 14:12.893
Bright.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.853
Why are you going down?

14:14.937 --> 14:16.480
None of your business.

14:17.648 --> 14:18.816
Dakky, light.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.830
-I'm not letting you get away.
-I'm not running away.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.601
You're trying to get to that girl Konoha,
aren't you?

14:54.101 --> 14:55.269
What is this?

14:55.352 --> 14:58.772
It looks like a disposable mask.
Nonwoven fabric?

14:58.856 --> 15:01.775
A light bulkhead. Made out of fabric.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.404
A bulkhead? How are you so well-versed?

15:09.116 --> 15:11.493
This can be manually opened?

15:12.286 --> 15:14.788
When the air pressure
on both sides is the same.

15:15.497 --> 15:16.540
Bright.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.085
Don't follow me.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.922
I can't leave you. I'll accompany you.

15:23.672 --> 15:27.927
You said you were going to raise Lunatic
and destroy everybody on Earth.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.053
So what?

15:29.637 --> 15:32.181
You have no idea how horrible Lunatic is.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.183
Shut up, Earther.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.311
You people will never understand me.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.604
Not ever.

15:38.687 --> 15:42.358
Well, well. You trying to compete?
I won't be beat this time.

15:42.441 --> 15:48.447
Do you think a PT dropout like you
can beat an Earther who lives at 1G?

15:53.827 --> 15:55.788
Go extinct, Earther!

16:06.090 --> 16:07.549
He's so slow.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.639
What's that sound?

16:13.722 --> 16:15.808
Maybe I should go back for him.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.152
Hang on a second!

16:27.236 --> 16:31.240
The interior contractors shouldn't be
loading materials in a place like this.

16:34.618 --> 16:35.619
Wait!

16:38.622 --> 16:39.623
Look out!

16:40.749 --> 16:43.127
A fabric bulkhead?

16:43.210 --> 16:45.796
-Why is it inflated in the back?
-Don't touch it!

16:46.588 --> 16:48.507
Behind this, it is a vacuum.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.968
Touch it and it's curtains for you.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.512
Here.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.931
Thank goodness
it's on this side of the bulkhead.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.016
KONOHA BAIKONUR NANASE

17:00.686 --> 17:01.770
Nobody's here.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.326
Konoha!

17:18.078 --> 17:20.122
Are you okay, Konoha?

17:21.331 --> 17:22.416
Oxygen deficiency.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.918
What's the matter? Is she dead?

17:25.002 --> 17:27.171
We need to hurry up
and take lifesaving measures.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.468
Damn it. The password.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.307
-What are you doing?
-Lifesaving actions.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.768
-Are you breaking the law again?
-Shut up!

17:40.851 --> 17:45.606
If I followed the laws made
by Earther AIs, we'd both be dead.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.107
Don't interfere!

17:49.735 --> 17:51.528
Her breathing's stopped.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.072
The password.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.158
Damn it!

17:56.241 --> 17:58.243
What are you doing? Out of the way!

17:58.827 --> 18:00.412
Excuse me.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.751
A password Nasa might use--

18:06.418 --> 18:07.419
Maybe--

18:07.503 --> 18:10.589
PLEASE ENTER PASSWORD

18:10.672 --> 18:11.673
Yes.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.759
Cardiopulmonary.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.052
Here it is.

18:18.388 --> 18:19.723
She's revived.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.308
Konoha, hold on.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.528
Implants?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.489
The rumors were true then?

18:35.572 --> 18:36.573
Yeah.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.577
We have implants in our brains.

18:40.661 --> 18:44.665
It was originally
just to adjust the balance of hormones.

18:44.748 --> 18:46.792
But it can also access reflex,
cardiopulmonary

18:46.875 --> 18:48.836
and other important functions.

18:49.962 --> 18:54.550
Of the 15 moon-born,
ten died by age three.

18:55.175 --> 18:58.720
They found out that the low gravity
on the moon's surface

18:58.804 --> 19:01.056
has a fatal impact on growing infants.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.184
The surviving five children
had implants embedded.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.854
Moon child syndrome.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.731
They worked well in infancy.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.234
But it was uncertain what would happen
in the second period of growth

19:12.317 --> 19:13.944
when the hormone balance changes.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.779
Nobody knew.

19:16.572 --> 19:17.948
So before that,

19:18.031 --> 19:21.827
the implants were supposed to dissolve
and break down into water and nitrogen

19:21.910 --> 19:23.370
per the design.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.832
Due to a design flaw,
they didn't dissolve?

19:26.915 --> 19:28.083
They started to dissolve,

19:28.167 --> 19:30.794
but with the design flaw,
half of the implant remains.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.130
I still have time with mine,

19:33.213 --> 19:36.049
but Konoha's is out of time.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.261
We have to prosecute the firm
that made them.

19:39.344 --> 19:43.765
The firm that designed them went bankrupt.
There's nobody to sue.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.143
Is that firm--

19:46.643 --> 19:48.520
Seven Technology.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.106
Seven designed them?

19:51.190 --> 19:54.943
Yes. It is a product
from its period of peak intelligence.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.070
Lunatic Seven.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.698
But Seven's intelligence collapsed.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.450
It was euthanized.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.786
So now nobody understands
the design philosophy itself,

20:04.870 --> 20:06.538
much less the design flaws.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.874
No human, no AI.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.626
Are you--

20:10.709 --> 20:12.461
That's why the Lunatic is so--

20:12.544 --> 20:13.712
<i>Found them!</i>

20:14.755 --> 20:16.340
<i>It's me. Mina.</i>

20:17.174 --> 20:19.843
-It's too bright.
-<i>Sorry about that.</i>

20:19.927 --> 20:21.803
<i>Touya, it's me.</i>

20:22.554 --> 20:23.555
Nasa.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.433
<i>Nasa is too weak</i>
<i>to make it to the top.</i>

20:26.516 --> 20:28.936
<i>She said to bring a wheelchair.</i>

20:35.108 --> 20:38.070
Where is this?

20:50.040 --> 20:51.875
It's been a long time.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.422
Touya! Taiyou!

20:58.590 --> 20:59.633
Hakase.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.052
Nasa.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.056
Touya, are you okay? Ouch.

21:06.139 --> 21:07.849
Is everyone all right?

21:09.268 --> 21:12.562
I've hurt a rib. But never mind that.
How is Konoha?

21:13.355 --> 21:16.108
Is she another moon-born kid?

21:16.191 --> 21:17.943
Yeah, probably.

21:18.026 --> 21:20.404
She lived in Tateana City on the moon.

21:20.487 --> 21:21.571
Tateana City?

21:21.655 --> 21:24.825
A Japanese moon-surface city
in Marius Hills.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.079
She might be easier to talk to.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.706
She stopped breathing?

21:30.789 --> 21:34.084
I restored it immediately. It's fine.

21:34.167 --> 21:37.713
Touya, you didn't hack
the implant again, did you?

21:37.796 --> 21:38.964
Why not?

21:39.047 --> 21:41.300
That isn't something
you can carelessly fiddle with.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.719
-If you made even one mistake--
-Nasa.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.887
He saved her life.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.725
If he hadn't done that,
Konoha would be dead right now.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.518
I know.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.478
I wasn't carelessly fiddling with it.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.732
I've experimented on my own implant
in the lab many times.

21:57.482 --> 22:00.402
I know that, but don't do it anymore.

22:00.485 --> 22:03.697
Konoha's implant
is in worse shape than--

22:03.780 --> 22:04.990
I knew it.

22:05.782 --> 22:09.870
Wasn't it you and my uncle
who laughed it off as an urban legend?

22:09.953 --> 22:11.913
Touya, there's a good reason that--

22:11.997 --> 22:15.876
You adults were in on it
and kept it from us all this time.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.213
Nasa.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.467
Did I faint again?

22:23.550 --> 22:25.635
Yes, but it's okay.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.138
It's not your fault.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.140
The implants.

22:30.724 --> 22:31.892
You were listening?

22:33.643 --> 22:35.479
Right, Touya?

22:37.022 --> 22:40.650
I want to get better soon
and then go to Earth.

22:43.111 --> 22:46.323
Konoha, you'll be able to go to Earth
after just a bit.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.408
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.410
We're going up again?

22:50.494 --> 22:54.289
Why did that elevator go
all the way to the bottom?

22:54.372 --> 22:57.584
It's for safety.
It would be dangerous if it fell.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.961
They really have no regard
for their guests.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.838
I'm gonna sue once we've been saved.

23:01.922 --> 23:05.509
Everybody, please stop with
the idle chatter and keep walking.

23:05.592 --> 23:09.179
If we can get to the shuttle area,
we can probably get on a rescue ship.

23:09.262 --> 23:12.849
Taiyou has been pretty full of himself
for quite some time, hasn't he?

23:12.933 --> 23:15.727
I'm a temporary employee of the UN2,

23:15.811 --> 23:18.605
so I have a duty
to rescue everybody in a disaster.

23:18.688 --> 23:21.274
-UN2?
-The UN2?

23:21.358 --> 23:23.527
-What's that?
-The United Nations!

23:23.610 --> 23:25.737
You're not an employee.
You're a nonregular.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.322
It's like a part-time job.

23:27.405 --> 23:29.616
Taiyou.

23:29.699 --> 23:30.867
Yes?

23:30.951 --> 23:34.287
Sorry for any trouble
Touya's caused you.

23:34.371 --> 23:37.332
He can be sharp tongued,
but he really is a good person.

23:37.415 --> 23:39.417
Yes. You're right.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.086
He is sharp tongued, isn't he?

23:41.169 --> 23:42.879
I'm sorry for the trouble.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.090
Stop doing that right in front of me!

23:45.882 --> 23:47.592
What's this, a balloon?

23:48.176 --> 23:50.011
A balloon bulkhead.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.514
We came from the other side of it.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.018
It automatically repairs itself.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.020
Seems like
there is oxygen on the other side.

23:59.604 --> 24:00.730
A spa?

24:00.814 --> 24:03.900
This says it is a super-bathhouse--
"Anshin Springs."

24:03.984 --> 24:06.361
I guess that's why
this is called a spa hub.

24:06.444 --> 24:08.780
It says you can see Earth from the bath.

24:08.864 --> 24:12.492
This is the Mars floor.
So it must be 100 meters more.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.829
Something like a 30-story skyscraper.

24:15.912 --> 24:20.167
As we climb higher, there's less gravity,
so it'll be easier than lower down.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.127
Konoha.

24:22.752 --> 24:26.047
I'm Mina. From Saitama on Earth.

24:26.131 --> 24:30.177
Both you and Touya were born
on the moon, right?

24:30.260 --> 24:34.264
We were raised together in Tateana City,
a city on the moon's surface.

24:34.347 --> 24:38.101
Even so, your personalities
are like night and day, aren't they?

24:39.394 --> 24:42.147
Konoha,
how many followers do you have?

24:42.230 --> 24:44.107
I don't use SNS.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.735
Really?
I didn't know people like you existed.

24:46.818 --> 24:47.903
Wow!

24:47.986 --> 24:51.239
Could you please do that later? Let's go.

24:54.409 --> 24:56.536
Just one more.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.413
Are you excited to see your parents?

24:58.496 --> 25:00.040
-Mina.
-What?

25:00.123 --> 25:02.959
-You shouldn't ask about her parents.
-Why not?

25:03.543 --> 25:07.714
I think Konoha's father died
in an accident on the moon's surface.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.383
And Touya's parents too.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.720
I mean, it happened years ago.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.306
What kind of accident was it?

25:19.809 --> 25:21.311
I'm not sure.

25:21.394 --> 25:25.440
Internet rumors say they were doing
some kind of an experiment.

25:29.152 --> 25:31.988
All right. We just need to climb up here.

25:40.747 --> 25:41.748
Konoha.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.002
Konoha, what's wrong?

25:47.254 --> 25:48.255
The snow--

25:51.132 --> 25:52.509
It's snowing.

25:52.592 --> 25:53.718
Snow?

25:57.222 --> 26:00.308
There's something at the top.

26:00.392 --> 26:04.145
-Stop the wheelchair!
-What? Did something happen?

26:05.063 --> 26:08.900
There's snow falling in the station.

26:09.567 --> 26:12.654
Oxygen-- The oxygen is escaping.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.412
Run!

26:20.495 --> 26:23.039
What's happening up there?

26:23.123 --> 26:24.207
Run!

26:25.834 --> 26:27.168
Run!

26:32.924 --> 26:34.759
Hurry up and close it.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.360
What is this?

26:52.944 --> 26:54.321
Do what I do.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.323
First, pull the handles.

26:56.406 --> 26:58.700
Bring out your hoods and gloves.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.285
Fasten everything tight.

27:00.994 --> 27:03.747
Once everything is fastened and locked,
release the valve.

27:05.415 --> 27:07.208
Nasa and I are all suited up.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.627
My fastener.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.882
Damn it! It's not catching.

27:15.925 --> 27:18.094
Here is some oxygen. Can you hear me?

27:18.178 --> 27:19.637
Breathe in the oxygen.

27:20.388 --> 27:22.057
What is that? Something is here!

27:22.140 --> 27:25.101
Oh, no. She's hallucinating
from oxygen deficiency.

27:25.643 --> 27:28.063
There it is!

27:33.526 --> 27:36.738
I am Anshin-kun, the station fairy.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.199
-Chief.
-Chief?

27:40.450 --> 27:41.993
The rift is getting wider.

27:48.541 --> 27:50.835
Follow this guy.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.856
Oops.

28:12.899 --> 28:14.067
Jump!

28:19.155 --> 28:20.198
I can't--

28:21.282 --> 28:22.951
I can't reach it.

29:54.667 --> 29:58.087
