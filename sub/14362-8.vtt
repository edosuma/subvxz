00:14.573 --> 00:15.465
Hey, Mike, guess what.

00:15.563 --> 00:16.841
I just got off the phone
with Janet--

00:16.931 --> 00:18.979
No, we're not going to your
sister's house for Christmas

00:19.071 --> 00:21.136
or doing one of those big
summer things at the lake

00:21.256 --> 00:22.642
or getting a picture made
with everybody

00:22.724 --> 00:23.975
while people are still alive.

00:24.063 --> 00:25.659
Will you let me finish?

00:25.771 --> 00:28.451
Janet and Gary are taking Lucy
on a parenting weekend

00:28.537 --> 00:30.652
for "taming your violent kid"
or something,

00:30.752 --> 00:32.543
and they want us
to house-sit!

00:32.674 --> 00:33.868
Why would we want to do that?

00:33.984 --> 00:34.693
Oh, I don't know--

00:34.776 --> 00:36.449
'cause their house is nice
and ours isn't?

00:36.547 --> 00:38.284
Come on, we can get away
for the weekend,

00:38.373 --> 00:40.625
just the two of us--
it's romantic.

00:40.776 --> 00:42.972
Ew!
You guys?

00:43.148 --> 00:44.691
What?
We're romantic.

00:44.803 --> 00:46.579
I've never even seen you kiss.

00:46.659 --> 00:48.019
We kiss.
We kiss all the time.

00:48.096 --> 00:49.057
See?

00:50.477 --> 00:51.874
Yeah, you guys should go.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.367
Campus police!

01:01.436 --> 01:02.666
Axl Heck,
we know you're in there!

01:02.746 --> 01:04.998
- We're here to remove you from campus!
- What?!

01:05.263 --> 01:06.768
What?! Yeah!

01:06.865 --> 01:07.985
Ohhh!

01:08.064 --> 01:09.229
Yeah!

01:09.528 --> 01:10.955
This is gonna be
the best weekend ever!

01:11.043 --> 01:12.249
You bet it is!

01:12.319 --> 01:13.425
I thought it was Wednesday.

01:13.527 --> 01:15.187
So, prepare yourselves
for awesomeness,

01:15.266 --> 01:17.511
'cause I've got like five
parties lined up for later.

01:17.582 --> 01:18.394
Nice.

01:20.135 --> 01:21.228
So, what do you guys
want to do now?

01:26.380 --> 01:29.033
Okay, so, remember, the house
makes a lot of weird noises,

01:29.132 --> 01:30.882
but there's no reason
to get scared.

01:30.977 --> 01:33.319
The "ca-chunk, ca-chunk"
is the refrigerator,

01:33.420 --> 01:35.471
the "braaaaaaa-unk"
is the heater,

01:35.575 --> 01:37.869
and the "da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da"
is the washer lid.

01:37.971 --> 01:39.489
If it gets too loud,
just put more tape on it.

01:39.590 --> 01:41.853
Not to worry, mom.
We'll be fine.

01:41.990 --> 01:42.727
Mm-hmm.

01:42.838 --> 01:44.241
Well, you'd bell, you'
'cause I'm not driving back,

01:44.339 --> 01:46.465
even if there's a guy outside
with a knife.

01:46.556 --> 01:47.986
Mike, that's not gonna happen.

01:48.069 --> 01:49.117
They caught that guy.

01:49.200 --> 01:49.950
What?!

01:50.025 --> 01:51.118
You'll be fine.

01:51.618 --> 01:52.276
All righty.

01:52.371 --> 01:53.417
We'll see you guys!

01:53.611 --> 01:54.611
Be good, now.

01:54.839 --> 01:55.873
Bye, guys!

01:56.186 --> 01:58.100
Have a good time!

01:58.344 --> 01:59.566
And don't you worry
about a thing,

01:59.674 --> 02:02.335
because Sue Heck
is on the case!

02:04.139 --> 02:06.642
Brick, we are gonna have--

02:07.483 --> 02:08.711
Brick?

02:09.882 --> 02:11.169
Brick?!

02:15.512 --> 02:16.432
This is nice--

02:16.504 --> 02:18.327
like being at the beach,
but in a tiny room.

02:18.493 --> 02:19.530
Yeah.

02:19.831 --> 02:22.566
So, Ax-Man,
how's the talent out here?

02:22.664 --> 02:23.505
Gettin' out there?

02:23.585 --> 02:25.237
Yeah. Yeah, I've been
going out some, but, uh

02:25.435 --> 02:27.311
I don't know.
Never mind.

02:27.810 --> 02:29.179
What?

02:29.499 --> 02:30.291
It's kinda weird,

02:30.443 --> 02:34.829
but, uh... anyway, I...
keep thinking about Cassidy.

02:34.897 --> 02:37.043
I knew it!
You're still into her!

02:37.129 --> 02:38.521
Maybe! I don't know.

02:38.652 --> 02:39.782
Have you talked to her?

02:40.056 --> 02:42.056
No. I haven't seen her
since graduation.

02:42.428 --> 02:44.176
Well, maybe you need to see her
again, face-to-face,

02:44.247 --> 02:45.227
see how you feel.

02:45.301 --> 02:47.212
Yeah, I'll just
drive 10 hours to Vassar, sure.

02:47.349 --> 02:48.821
Yes! Road trip!

02:48.930 --> 02:50.028
No. We're not going
on a--

02:50.123 --> 02:51.224
Road trip!

02:51.406 --> 02:52.818
Seriously. Dudes.
Get real.

02:52.956 --> 02:54.397
We already called
"Road trip."

02:54.473 --> 02:55.534
We have to do it!

02:55.683 --> 02:57.577
That-- that is
the rule of "Road trip."

02:59.229 --> 03:00.871
- Road trip!
- Road trip! - Road trip!

03:01.004 --> 03:02.764
Yeah! Yeah!

03:06.461 --> 03:08.295
Oh, wow!

03:09.094 --> 03:10.643
It's like being on vacation!

03:10.719 --> 03:12.182
The minute we got in the car
without the kids,

03:12.270 --> 03:13.419
it was a vacation.

03:13.732 --> 03:15.113
You know, if you
play your cards right,

03:15.188 --> 03:17.459
this could be
a <i>very</i> nice weekend.

03:17.535 --> 03:19.902
You're telling me.
Look at that TV!

03:20.415 --> 03:21.732
The game's on!

03:22.030 --> 03:23.063
Yeah.

03:23.188 --> 03:24.944
All right, well,
you watch your game

03:25.037 --> 03:27.588
while I soak
in the jacuzzi tub,

03:27.689 --> 03:30.480
where I won't have to turn on
the hot water with pliers.

03:31.359 --> 03:34.149
All right.
I will see you later.

03:34.225 --> 03:35.671
I might even
slip on a negligee.

03:35.846 --> 03:36.797
Really?

03:36.897 --> 03:39.112
Well, a clean night shirt--
you know, the one with the lace?

03:39.220 --> 03:42.198
It had a bloodstain from Brick's
nosebleed, but it's mostly out.

03:42.266 --> 03:43.344
Oh, I like that one.

03:46.074 --> 03:47.047
Brick?

03:47.145 --> 03:47.972
Oh, Brick!

03:48.052 --> 03:49.136
Oh, my God, there you are!

03:49.221 --> 03:51.785
Ah! Boom.
Old easter candy.

03:51.910 --> 03:53.815
When the cat's away.

03:56.324 --> 03:57.910
Could be from previous owners.

03:57.996 --> 03:59.904
Brick, you scared me to death!

04:00.033 --> 04:01.559
I am in charge.

04:01.661 --> 04:04.112
That means I need to know
where you are at all times.

04:04.195 --> 04:05.202
All times!

04:05.285 --> 04:06.681
I thought this weekend
was gonna be fun.

04:06.823 --> 04:07.666
It will be!

04:07.746 --> 04:09.878
But it has to be safe.
Safe fun!

04:09.983 --> 04:10.916
That's why--

04:12.864 --> 04:14.126
What was that?

04:14.437 --> 04:16.483
Probably just the refrigerator.

04:19.672 --> 04:21.790
Oh, wait--
we have a dog now!

04:21.916 --> 04:23.290
Oh, right!

04:42.180 --> 04:44.217
This is so unfair.
I called shotgun.

04:44.257 --> 04:46.821
I told you-- you have to see
the car before you call shotgun.

04:46.899 --> 04:47.569
Since when?

04:47.655 --> 04:48.840
Since the beginning of shotgun!

04:48.926 --> 04:50.073
Oh, my God, let it go, Darrin.

04:50.164 --> 04:51.864
We're in Ohio now.
Once you cross state lines,

04:51.942 --> 04:53.551
you got to stop
complaining about shotgun.

04:53.649 --> 04:54.880
I thought we were
going to New York.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.811
- Are we lost?
- You are.

04:56.916 --> 04:59.191
Guess they don't teach geography
in air-conditioning school.

05:00.428 --> 05:01.975
No, but I'll tell you
what I <i>do</i> know.

05:02.026 --> 05:03.775
It's 80 bucks an hour
to fix an air conditioner,

05:03.856 --> 05:06.005
so suck it, college boys!

05:06.217 --> 05:08.056
Man, Cassidy
is gonna be blown away

05:08.143 --> 05:10.101
when you show up at her door
and lay one on her--

05:10.194 --> 05:11.532
totally awesome move.

05:12.267 --> 05:13.990
Damn straight!

05:15.121 --> 05:17.567
Unless... I open the door

05:17.644 --> 05:19.369
and she's making out
with her new boyfriend.

05:20.076 --> 05:21.765
That would be
slightly less awesome.

05:22.393 --> 05:23.761
Wait. This is insane.

05:24.130 --> 05:25.688
How did I think
I could do this?!

05:25.846 --> 05:27.449
I know nothing
about her life--

05:27.553 --> 05:29.175
who she's with,
what she's doing.

05:29.255 --> 05:30.739
She may not even remember me!

05:30.965 --> 05:32.395
That's it.
I'm turning around.

05:50.814 --> 05:52.684
- Glossner!
- Glossner!

06:01.253 --> 06:03.212
Wh-what is Diaper Glossner
doing here?!

06:03.299 --> 06:04.579
Whatever he wants!

06:06.530 --> 06:07.582
This is bad.

06:07.672 --> 06:09.389
My American Girl
Babysitting manual

06:09.498 --> 06:11.458
did not prepare me for this!

06:11.568 --> 06:12.706
How did he even get in here?

06:12.791 --> 06:13.852
Did you leave the door open?

06:13.933 --> 06:15.036
I was looking for you!

06:15.196 --> 06:16.320
This is all your fault.

06:16.413 --> 06:17.842
Unh-unh.
Don't pin this on me.

06:17.927 --> 06:19.485
You're the one in charge.

06:19.679 --> 06:20.575
Oh.

06:20.768 --> 06:22.145
Um, maybe we should
call his mom.

06:22.329 --> 06:23.679
Rita Glossner? Sure.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.092
What's the number
for the lady prison?

06:26.723 --> 06:27.929
Okay. Okay.

06:28.035 --> 06:28.928
We can do this.

06:29.286 --> 06:30.982
Diaper Glossner is just a kid.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.984
He probably doesn't even know
anyone is home.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.336
We'll just go out,
talk really loud,

06:35.431 --> 06:36.740
and then he'll get scared
and leave.

06:36.833 --> 06:38.280
- All right.
- Okay.

06:46.377 --> 06:47.450
Shh!

06:53.919 --> 06:55.371
Got any beer in the fridge?

06:55.427 --> 06:57.046
Yeah, we got beer.

06:57.142 --> 06:58.681
That's why I'm drinkin' pop.

06:58.805 --> 07:00.997
Hey, what'd mom say
about the attitude?

07:01.193 --> 07:02.239
Nothin'.

07:04.116 --> 07:06.556
Two Glossners?!

07:09.244 --> 07:11.396
Well, I couldn't
get the bath to work.

07:11.467 --> 07:12.365
It's got this keypad,

07:12.447 --> 07:13.814
and every time
I got the jets to come on,

07:13.898 --> 07:15.189
the water would drain.

07:15.263 --> 07:17.569
Anyway, I got my feet wet,
so that was nice.

07:17.795 --> 07:19.083
Why aren't you
watching the game?

07:19.238 --> 07:22.416
'Cause I can't figure out
how to turn on the TV.

07:22.523 --> 07:24.086
Did you press the "On" button?

07:24.250 --> 07:27.110
Okay, I didn't press the "On"
button 'cause I can't find it.

07:27.187 --> 07:28.679
Oh, you just need
some fresh eyes.

07:28.797 --> 07:30.431
So, which remote did you use?

07:30.532 --> 07:31.737
I don't know.
They all look alike!

07:31.911 --> 07:35.059
Uhh... this looks like
the one for the TV.

07:35.415 --> 07:37.820
Let's see what
Janet's instructions say.

07:37.909 --> 07:38.787
Mm.

07:39.297 --> 07:44.864
"Input"... "Input"...
"Satellite"... "TV source."

07:44.963 --> 07:46.059
I don't see "TV source."

07:46.134 --> 07:46.753
Come on, Frankie.

07:46.836 --> 07:48.174
I've already missed
half the game.

07:48.945 --> 07:50.443
Where are ya, you little...

07:51.331 --> 07:52.920
Oh!
Here it is!

07:53.757 --> 07:54.930
Now what do I do?

07:55.030 --> 07:57.276
Well, I don't know,
'cause I don't have my glasses.

07:58.549 --> 08:01.608
"Slide button
to 'AV 2.'"

08:05.918 --> 08:07.287
I don't see it.

08:07.846 --> 08:09.830
Wait-- how do you slide
a button, anyway?

08:09.990 --> 08:10.975
You must have misread it.

08:11.066 --> 08:12.045
No! I--

08:12.790 --> 08:14.801
It says right here--
"Slide button to 'AV 2.'"

08:14.886 --> 08:15.832
I think I know how to read.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.075
I see...
"Display. Format. Sync."

08:19.163 --> 08:21.190
Okay. Hold on.
Here.

08:24.236 --> 08:26.110
You really need to get
your own glasses.

08:26.188 --> 08:27.389
I don't need 'em.

08:27.482 --> 08:28.927
Oh! Found it.

08:29.003 --> 08:30.096
It's on the side.

08:30.685 --> 08:32.085
Mm. The TV should be on.

08:32.183 --> 08:34.311
Come on, damn it!
Do something!

08:34.390 --> 08:35.962
All right.
Wait. Hold on.

08:41.443 --> 08:42.895
Way to go, Fonzie.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.152
You know, even though
I'm not gonna see Cassidy,

08:48.227 --> 08:49.830
this has been pretty awesome.

08:49.938 --> 08:51.326
Super awesome.

08:51.810 --> 08:53.593
Although,
even if she had a boyfriend,

08:53.705 --> 08:56.204
you showin' up would have been
insanely romantic.

08:56.391 --> 08:57.708
Yeah.

08:57.877 --> 08:59.015
Would have been
a serious power move

08:59.094 --> 09:01.054
that would have rocked
Cassidy's world.

09:02.765 --> 09:04.178
We're goin' back!

09:08.074 --> 09:08.787
Oh!

09:08.872 --> 09:10.715
I think the Glossners
went down to the basement.

09:10.804 --> 09:11.726
What are we gonna do?

09:11.837 --> 09:12.574
I know.

09:12.675 --> 09:14.236
What if we
lay a trail of pop-tarts

09:14.350 --> 09:15.724
from the basement door
to the front door?

09:15.828 --> 09:17.938
Then, when the Glossners
follow the trail out the door,

09:18.022 --> 09:20.218
we slam it
and lock them outside!

09:20.334 --> 09:23.165
Brick, this isn't
a road runner cartoon.

09:23.267 --> 09:24.233
Might I remind you

09:24.316 --> 09:25.802
of a little story
called "Hansel And Gretel"?

09:25.930 --> 09:27.330
- Woop!
- Shhh!

09:27.390 --> 09:28.227
Might I remind you

09:28.316 --> 09:30.075
that the kids ended up
captured by the witch--

09:30.150 --> 09:31.708
and didn't they get eaten?

09:31.783 --> 09:33.149
Well, it depends on
whether you're talking about

09:33.224 --> 09:35.742
the 1812 German version
or the later version where--

09:35.851 --> 09:36.603
Brick!

09:36.691 --> 09:37.878
We have Glossners
in the basement.

09:37.992 --> 09:38.784
Tick-tock!

09:53.723 --> 09:55.640
Great idea, Brick!

09:55.751 --> 09:58.041
Now we have three Glossners
in the house.

09:58.147 --> 09:59.472
It's an infestation!

09:59.649 --> 10:01.034
You know, if Hansel and Gretel

10:01.124 --> 10:02.360
were anything like
the Glossners,

10:02.456 --> 10:04.272
I'm starting to see
the witch's side of the story.

10:04.835 --> 10:05.921
Yeah.

10:13.828 --> 10:15.975
<i>So, Mike and I had dreams</i>
<i>of a romantic dinner,</i>

10:16.072 --> 10:17.384
<i>but, because we're us,</i>

10:17.484 --> 10:19.898
<i>it didn't turn out</i>
<i>exactly as planned.</i>

10:19.980 --> 10:21.935
Shut up and make dinner!

10:22.161 --> 10:25.785
3... 50... bake!

10:25.895 --> 10:28.012
<i>Well, at least I wasn't yelling at Mike.</i>

10:28.128 --> 10:30.621
Activating
defrost sequence now.

10:30.703 --> 10:32.913
Hey, I think I'm zeroing in
on the power button!

10:34.557 --> 10:35.373
Nope!

10:35.457 --> 10:37.399
I think the TV may be
a bigger idiot than the oven.

10:37.505 --> 10:38.718
<i>Cooking complete.</i>

10:38.805 --> 10:40.312
Yeah. I doubt that.

10:41.654 --> 10:43.776
♪ this is the part of me ♪

10:43.859 --> 10:47.024
♪ that you're never gonna
ever take away from me ♪

10:47.107 --> 10:48.460
♪ noooo! ♪

10:48.553 --> 10:50.081
Whoo!

10:50.202 --> 10:51.879
Yeah!

10:53.935 --> 10:55.498
Oh, my God!

10:55.622 --> 10:56.375
What am I doing?

10:56.478 --> 10:57.942
She's gonna think
I'm some ginormous stalker.

10:58.019 --> 10:59.916
Turn around! Turn around!

11:08.106 --> 11:09.860
Whoa, nice cut, man!

11:09.943 --> 11:12.398
I can't believe they're
playing baseball in the house!

11:12.514 --> 11:14.005
It's one thing
to walk in uninvited,

11:14.090 --> 11:17.093
and it's another to fly
in the face of house rules!

11:17.181 --> 11:18.784
I'm just surprised
we have apples!

11:18.919 --> 11:21.680
Anyways, the Glossners should
leave once we cut the power.

11:21.790 --> 11:23.428
- Ready?
- Yeah.

11:24.362 --> 11:27.057
One... two... three.

11:27.648 --> 11:29.367
- I'm scared!
- Me too!

11:35.661 --> 11:37.772
You see that one, too, right?

11:43.844 --> 11:45.415
I don't believe it.

11:45.499 --> 11:46.443
I can't get through to Janet

11:46.560 --> 11:49.695
'cause it keeps asking me
for my nine-digit phone code!

11:49.845 --> 11:53.150
Where is that book with
all the instructions and codes?

11:53.271 --> 11:54.731
I gave it to you--
you threw it at the oven.

11:57.128 --> 11:59.111
Come on!

11:59.312 --> 12:02.002
All I did was hit
the ice-cube button.

12:02.091 --> 12:04.523
Apparently, it thought I wanted
all the ice in the world.

12:04.677 --> 12:07.456
<i>3rd and 10!</i>
<i>He's fading back, and--</i>

12:07.529 --> 12:08.628
And?

12:08.779 --> 12:10.210
And?!

12:11.087 --> 12:13.796
Shouldn't an emergency radio
work in an actual emergency?

12:14.705 --> 12:15.640
Hey.

12:15.721 --> 12:17.360
You know what doesn't need
a remote?

12:17.947 --> 12:19.545
Booze! Ha ha!

12:20.167 --> 12:21.283
Okay.

12:24.001 --> 12:25.764
Not charged.

12:25.865 --> 12:27.212
Damn it, Frankie.

12:27.290 --> 12:29.087
You know, I didn't want
to come here in the first place.

12:29.168 --> 12:31.798
Big shocker--
I'll call Channel 9 news.

12:31.930 --> 12:33.624
What's that supposed to mean?

12:33.712 --> 12:36.006
You know what it means.
You never want to go anywhere.

12:36.091 --> 12:37.155
You're a stick in the mud.

12:37.231 --> 12:39.801
You take your stick and
you plant it right in the mud.

12:39.881 --> 12:43.191
Yeah, well, that's better
than being a "hopes too high."

12:43.340 --> 12:45.885
You get this whole perfect idea
of stuff built up in your head,

12:46.002 --> 12:47.435
and you're always disappointed.

12:47.509 --> 12:49.230
Why? 'Cause your hopes
are too high.

12:49.387 --> 12:51.727
Well, excuse me
for wanting to have fun.

12:51.936 --> 12:55.416
Oh, right,
'cause this is so much fun!

12:55.573 --> 12:56.532
We're old, Frankie.

12:56.637 --> 12:58.207
We passed "fun"
a few miles back.

12:58.293 --> 13:00.341
You think this is turning out
the way I wanted it to?

13:00.461 --> 13:02.949
It's not, but I am
making the best of things.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.519
Your problem is
you can't roll with it.

13:05.628 --> 13:06.865
It's annoying, Mike!

13:06.989 --> 13:08.170
Oh, is that
what we're doing now?

13:08.290 --> 13:09.679
We're telling each other
what annoys us?

13:09.767 --> 13:10.610
'Cause I got stuff.

13:10.731 --> 13:12.897
Just because <i>I</i> said
something annoys me about you

13:12.988 --> 13:14.887
doesn't mean you have to say
something about me.

13:14.958 --> 13:17.201
You chew with your mouth open.

13:17.342 --> 13:19.830
Ever since you turned 40,
you chew with your mouth open.

13:19.904 --> 13:21.017
It reminds me of your dad.

13:21.122 --> 13:21.943
Wow.

13:22.056 --> 13:23.639
How long you been
sitting on that one?

13:23.735 --> 13:25.879
Hey, I was planning on
dying with that info.

13:25.985 --> 13:27.706
You're the one
that kicked this door open.

13:27.823 --> 13:29.543
Oven door open.

13:29.638 --> 13:30.851
Oh, shut up!

13:31.060 --> 13:32.892
<i>That time,</i>
<i>I</i> was <i>yelling at Mike.</i>

13:35.523 --> 13:37.257
Aw, man.

13:38.099 --> 13:39.796
Cassidy loved these chips.

13:52.092 --> 13:52.792
Okay.

13:52.893 --> 13:53.867
Before we waste any more gas,

13:53.943 --> 13:55.405
we've got to figure out
where we're going.

13:55.496 --> 13:56.905
Axl, you've got to decide, man.

13:56.979 --> 13:58.068
What do you want to do?

13:58.297 --> 14:00.023
Dude, it's so obvious
what you got to do.

14:00.119 --> 14:01.234
I agree.

14:01.369 --> 14:02.431
- Don't do it.
- Go for it.

14:03.867 --> 14:05.132
Why is this so hard?

14:05.295 --> 14:06.689
I mean,
I really want to see Cassidy,

14:06.787 --> 14:09.332
but I want to make sure she wants to see
me, but I can't do that until I see her,

14:09.416 --> 14:10.321
but then I will have seen her

14:10.396 --> 14:11.999
without knowing
if she wants to see me!

14:12.693 --> 14:13.503
Sorry.

14:13.577 --> 14:15.507
I'm too hungry to understand
what you just said.

14:15.579 --> 14:17.410
I know.

14:18.162 --> 14:20.030
I could go ballistic
on those onion rings

14:20.121 --> 14:21.468
those people left behind.

14:21.557 --> 14:23.076
Nobody leave
a full plate of onion rings.

14:23.148 --> 14:24.231
They probably just
went to the bathroom.

14:24.307 --> 14:25.676
Who goes to the bathroom
together?

14:25.820 --> 14:29.210
And look at the table--
empty cups <i>and</i> plates. Hmm?

14:29.286 --> 14:30.718
They obviously over-ordered.

14:30.802 --> 14:32.194
Or they're rich.

14:32.292 --> 14:33.758
I've got an uncle
who's an airplane pilot.

14:33.879 --> 14:35.428
Those onion rings
would be nothing to him.

14:35.548 --> 14:36.648
Yeah.

14:36.735 --> 14:38.132
They didn't even
take a doggy bag.

14:38.209 --> 14:39.240
Yeah. You know what?

14:39.361 --> 14:40.423
We should take 'em.

14:40.641 --> 14:41.714
They're just gonna
throw 'em out.

14:41.790 --> 14:43.192
No way,
that doesn't seem right.

14:43.264 --> 14:44.472
Oh, no, that doesn't seem right.

14:44.544 --> 14:45.739
Come on, dude, grow a pair.

14:45.827 --> 14:46.780
Okay, so go get 'em.

14:46.855 --> 14:48.039
No, you get 'em.
You're closer.

14:53.146 --> 14:53.756
Ha ha.

14:53.857 --> 14:56.074
Oh! Darn.
Left my keys in the car.

14:56.207 --> 14:57.467
No, you didn't.
They're right here.

15:04.865 --> 15:06.412
Oh, my God.
These are delicious.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.949
Whoa!
Oh! Look!

15:09.748 --> 15:10.674
Onion-ring goggles!

15:11.784 --> 15:13.267
I'm a British lord!

15:13.360 --> 15:14.348
Hoo-noo-noo!

15:14.500 --> 15:16.290
Look! I'm havin' a thought!
Like in a cartoon!

15:17.270 --> 15:21.143
Excuse me.
Did you take our onion rings?

15:24.931 --> 15:27.484
There's a girl Glossner?
When did that happen?

15:27.568 --> 15:28.682
I don't know.

15:28.875 --> 15:31.600
But she's winning
the farting contest.

15:33.030 --> 15:34.141
Wait a minute!

15:34.219 --> 15:35.615
I've got an idea.
Okay.

15:35.719 --> 15:37.265
We run out the door
screaming, "Fire,"

15:37.354 --> 15:38.610
and then, when they follow us
out the door,

15:38.710 --> 15:40.553
we dart back in
and we lock them out!

15:40.959 --> 15:42.904
I was thinking
of starting a real fire.

15:43.107 --> 15:44.108
But this is better!

15:45.357 --> 15:46.670
Fire! Get out!

15:46.765 --> 15:48.422
Run for your lives!

15:51.541 --> 15:53.928
Who doesn't run
when you yell, "Fire"?

15:54.020 --> 15:55.331
That's just not safe!

16:10.475 --> 16:11.688
Your turn.

16:11.773 --> 16:12.908
Fine.

16:18.488 --> 16:19.654
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:19.741 --> 16:22.542
Aah! Mike! Help!

16:22.636 --> 16:23.893
Aah! Oh!

16:25.507 --> 16:27.836
- Mike!
- What'd you do?!

16:27.961 --> 16:30.488
Nothing!
The machines are rebelling!

16:33.348 --> 16:34.645
What the...

16:35.121 --> 16:36.235
Ugh.

16:39.608 --> 16:43.304
Hey!
What-- what are you doing?!

16:43.634 --> 16:44.633
Having fun!

16:44.755 --> 16:45.945
What?!

16:46.310 --> 16:48.072
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- How's that feel? Too cold?

16:48.190 --> 16:49.180
All right, all right.
Now you're gonna get it.

16:49.265 --> 16:50.265
Now you're gonna get it!

16:50.356 --> 16:51.267
Hey, whoa!
Whoo-ho-ho-hoo!

16:52.071 --> 16:53.544
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

16:57.237 --> 16:58.742
Stop it!
That's no fair!

16:58.813 --> 17:00.982
You're taller than me!
You're gonna--

17:01.269 --> 17:03.548
- What's the matter?
- Okay. Okay.

17:11.703 --> 17:12.438
Come on!

17:12.541 --> 17:14.010
No!

17:16.747 --> 17:17.752
Come on.

17:17.896 --> 17:19.795
Oh, move, move!

17:19.874 --> 17:20.807
Come on!

17:26.579 --> 17:28.783
Mom and dad are never
gonna trust me again.

17:28.927 --> 17:31.347
I am a bad, bad babysitter.

17:31.442 --> 17:34.117
I am irresponsible.
I make irrational decisions.

17:34.195 --> 17:36.179
I choke
in stressful situations.

17:36.301 --> 17:38.178
Jump in anytime, Brick.

17:38.313 --> 17:40.493
You haven't said anything
I disagree with yet.

17:40.583 --> 17:43.558
Oh, God.
What are we gonna do?!

17:45.037 --> 17:47.350
Maybe if we just asked them
nicely, they'd leave.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.018
Oh, yeah.

17:50.094 --> 17:51.543
The Glossners
are just gonna leave

17:51.635 --> 17:53.566
'cause we ask them nicely.

17:53.647 --> 17:55.145
They're Glossners, Brick!

17:55.257 --> 17:57.440
The rules of society
don't apply to them.

17:57.552 --> 17:58.460
Think!

17:58.585 --> 18:00.953
Sue, if we turn on each other,
they win.

18:04.843 --> 18:06.477
Well, did you take
their onion rings?

18:06.604 --> 18:10.222
Uh... no.
No, we ordered these.

18:10.314 --> 18:11.069
No, you didn't.

18:11.165 --> 18:12.905
You ordered a bottomless pop
and two glasses.

18:13.003 --> 18:15.130
All right! All right! We took 'em.
It was an honest mistake.

18:15.215 --> 18:17.882
Yeah. Who leaves a full plate
of onion rings unattended?

18:17.990 --> 18:19.124
I say we stop
the finger-pointing,

18:19.218 --> 18:21.376
admit we're all at fault,
and let it go.

18:21.475 --> 18:25.327
Teenagers today...
run wild and steal onion rings,

18:25.437 --> 18:27.905
and it won't stop
until somebody takes a stand.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.131
I'll testify.

18:29.236 --> 18:30.785
I'm not afraid of your gang.

18:30.862 --> 18:32.454
Look. If you can just pay
for the onion rings you ate

18:32.545 --> 18:35.857
and buy them another order,
I can let you off the hook.

18:35.925 --> 18:38.292
Okay, fine. If we could
just borrow 1,200 pennies

18:38.387 --> 18:39.899
from your "Take a penny,
leave a penny" jar...

18:40.054 --> 18:42.313
Oh, uh plus a generous tip.

18:42.395 --> 18:44.659
Because the service here
has been excellent.

18:45.276 --> 18:47.335
I guess I have no choice
but to call the authorities.

18:47.419 --> 18:48.850
Whoa, wait! Um...

18:49.068 --> 18:52.030
If I may, uh,
say something in our defense...

18:53.431 --> 18:55.087
Run!!

18:55.982 --> 18:57.032
I call shotgun!

18:57.119 --> 18:58.301
Shut up, Darrin!

19:04.820 --> 19:06.251
Hello.

19:07.372 --> 19:08.466
Listen.

19:08.562 --> 19:10.809
We've put up with you and
your kinfolk for long enough.

19:10.975 --> 19:14.214
We would kindly like you
to leave our house now.

19:15.919 --> 19:16.962
Okay.

19:17.345 --> 19:18.889
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

19:18.973 --> 19:20.520
Leave the broken pieces.

19:20.599 --> 19:22.706
Screw it.
This place sucks anyways.

19:28.600 --> 19:33.397
So, uh... anyway... thanks.

19:33.483 --> 19:37.240
I only did it because
<i>you</i> asked me... not him.

19:37.998 --> 19:39.248
What are you talking about?

19:39.327 --> 19:40.556
Why do you think
I pull up your shrubs

19:40.654 --> 19:41.895
or knock over your mailbox

19:42.030 --> 19:44.396
or put rocks in the snowballs
I throw at ya?

19:44.507 --> 19:46.163
'Cause you're mean?

19:46.244 --> 19:47.425
Nope.

19:47.503 --> 19:51.024
It's 'cause...
I've always kinda liked ya.

19:51.696 --> 19:54.650
Uh... okay.

19:54.885 --> 19:56.097
It doesn't matter.

19:56.251 --> 19:57.277
I mean, look at ya.

19:57.341 --> 19:58.567
You're a rich girl--

19:58.649 --> 20:00.580
with your above-ground pool,
your two kinds of chips,

20:00.644 --> 20:02.055
and your one dad?

20:02.250 --> 20:06.274
Forget it.
Way out of my league.

20:06.570 --> 20:08.386
See ya around, princess.

20:13.501 --> 20:15.759
So?
Which way are you goin', Axl?

20:25.354 --> 20:26.316
<i>Like I said,</i>

20:26.397 --> 20:29.197
<i>the best stories are the ones</i>
<i>that end with a kiss.</i>

20:33.580 --> 20:35.767
Forgot my keys.

20:45.117 --> 20:48.635
<i>Yup. Sometimes things</i>
<i>don't end up how you expect.</i>

20:50.898 --> 20:54.100
<i>Sometimes, they end</i>
<i>exactly the way you expect.</i>

20:57.443 --> 21:00.532
<i>And sometimes you're not ready</i>
<i>to see how they end.</i>

21:01.622 --> 21:04.719
<i>You just want to hold out hope</i>
<i>a little longer.</i>
