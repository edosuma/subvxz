WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.402
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
CATHERINE:
<i> Did you sleep with him?</i>

00:03.404 --> 00:06.138
Yes.
And now Gideon is on your side.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.540
Were you seducing him so you can
get out of this alive?

00:08.542 --> 00:10.042
I don't know.

00:10.043 --> 00:11.543
Elizabeth is sending you
an offer to succeed her

00:11.545 --> 00:13.178
as queen of England.
In return,

00:13.180 --> 00:14.179
she will choose
your next husband.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.347
You are going to accept.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.116
The Vatican wants something.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.251
They want me to accept
Elizabeth's offer,

00:19.253 --> 00:21.620
and then when I am
named her successor,

00:21.622 --> 00:24.723
your queen will be assassinated,
and I will take her throne.

00:24.725 --> 00:28.060
I'm just a pawn, even if I were
assassinated, they'd just

00:28.062 --> 00:30.262
replace me with the next
Catholic in line.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.231
A man would be their preference.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.565
ELIZABETH:
I have named Queen Mary Stuart

00:33.567 --> 00:35.134
as my successor in exchange

00:35.136 --> 00:36.635
for choosing her next husband,

00:36.637 --> 00:38.103
and I choose you.

00:38.105 --> 00:39.405
CATHERINE:
It's the Red Knights.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.407
Catherine, watch out!

00:41.409 --> 00:43.275
"Your debt will be paid."

00:48.282 --> 00:50.149
You and Father
executed 13 knights

00:50.151 --> 00:51.650
on the trumped up charge

00:51.652 --> 00:54.253
of heresy, simply because
you couldn't pay them?

00:54.255 --> 00:56.255
How could you believe
that was your only option?

00:56.257 --> 00:58.724
Not the only one, the cleanest.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.325
I've already made

01:00.327 --> 01:02.795
the unwelcome move
of deposing Lord Narcisse--

01:02.797 --> 01:05.297
a popular regent--
so that you may rule

01:05.299 --> 01:07.299
by my side.
I cannot have

01:07.301 --> 01:08.567
your past sins
affecting my reign.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.802
You won't.

01:09.804 --> 01:13.072
This vendetta is against me,

01:13.074 --> 01:15.407
and I will handle it.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.210
(light applause, chattering)

01:18.212 --> 01:19.578
Impressive.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.380
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

01:21.382 --> 01:22.414
My late husband.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.565
He thought it was a skill

01:23.566 --> 01:24.715
that would serve me well.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.418
Well, King Francis was right.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.253
Now that I've seen
your abilities with a bow,

01:28.255 --> 01:30.122
I certainly
won't be crossing you.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.261
It's funny, isn't it?
The two of us here.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.497
Both knowing we've already
had our one true love.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.434
Still, you do as your queen
commands, Lord Dudley.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.703
I realize that Elizabeth's
given me something

01:44.705 --> 01:46.438
that I needed following
my wife's death.

01:47.408 --> 01:48.540
A fresh start.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.541
You'll be starting anew

01:49.543 --> 01:52.311
as the king consort of Scotland.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.779
That's not so bad, is it?

01:53.781 --> 01:55.380
(clay shattering)

01:55.382 --> 01:56.682
Neither is being named
Elizabeth's successor.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.684
Becoming the next in line

01:58.686 --> 02:00.385
to the English throne

02:00.387 --> 02:02.321
validates you
as a female monarch,

02:02.323 --> 02:04.323
allows you to rally
waning support.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.758
I can't imagine things
have been easy of late.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.361
What with finding yourself
a guest at French court,

02:09.363 --> 02:11.530
while your own country
turns against you.

02:18.172 --> 02:21.406
Your queen's decision probably
has less to do with helping me

02:21.408 --> 02:23.642
and my uncomfortable
political position,

02:23.644 --> 02:25.611
and more to do
with bolstering her own.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.312
It's very clever,

02:27.314 --> 02:30.315
naming a weakened
Catholic queen her successor,

02:30.317 --> 02:32.618
to reinforce herself
as the better choice.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.720
Elizabeth is shrewd.

02:34.722 --> 02:37.623
I suspect the two of you
have that in common.

02:39.226 --> 02:40.626
Perhaps, through our marriage,
I can build a bridge

02:40.628 --> 02:42.227
between the two of you.

02:42.229 --> 02:44.329
That would be beneficial.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.533
I want you to know that I am
fully committed to this union.

02:47.535 --> 02:50.836
I know that ours might
never become a great love,

02:50.838 --> 02:53.739
but I do believe we can have
a congenial life together.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.708
I believe that as well.

02:58.412 --> 03:01.313
Well, then,
shall we make it official?

03:02.516 --> 03:03.482
Mary,

03:03.484 --> 03:05.951
Queen of Scots,

03:05.953 --> 03:08.954
would you do me the honor
of becoming my wife?

03:11.425 --> 03:13.225
Yes, I will.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.686
I know you and Robert Dudley
have history,

03:40.688 --> 03:41.987
but he's not as terrible

03:41.989 --> 03:44.456
as you made him out to be,
Gideon.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.925
The man is as ambitious
as he is self-serving.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.595
Apparently Elizabeth finds
those to be appealing qualities.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.530
He all but admitted that
he's still in love with her.

03:51.532 --> 03:52.598
Their love was real,

03:52.600 --> 03:54.366
I can tell you that.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.368
Yes, perhaps, that's
the answer-- encouraging him

03:56.370 --> 03:58.003
that to wed you
would be to give up,

03:58.005 --> 03:59.605
when he should be fighting
for Elizabeth's hand.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.673
Well, they have no chance
of a future together.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.508
He knows that.

04:03.510 --> 04:06.011
Well, I could lie and tell him
you're a miserable lover.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.780
Dudley made one thing clear,

04:08.782 --> 04:10.249
he needs this marriage.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.251
He believes it's
his only option.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.019
Lately, however, I've been
pondering a different man.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.555
Likely the Vatican thinks
that once I take

04:16.557 --> 04:18.590
the English throne,
I will be ousted

04:18.592 --> 04:20.559
or killed.
If they plan

04:20.561 --> 04:21.593
to put a king
on the throne after me,

04:21.595 --> 04:22.861
they must have someone in mind.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.696
That someone isn't Dudley,

04:24.698 --> 04:26.031
because he isn't getting
the Crown Matrimonial.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.899
Nor is he Catholic.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.269
Are there any other Catholic
males in the line of succession?

04:30.271 --> 04:31.937
The most likely candidate
in our family tree

04:31.939 --> 04:34.606
is a distant cousin
of mine and Elizabeth's.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.707
His name is Joseph Tudor.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.777
A Catholic and a Tudor to boot.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.946
Do you have any idea
where he is?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.581
After Mary Tudor died

04:42.583 --> 04:44.316
and Elizabeth
turned England Protestant,

04:44.318 --> 04:45.584
Joseph fled to France.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.586
If my theory is correct,

04:47.588 --> 04:50.422
then Archbishop Ridolfi has
already been in contact with him

04:50.424 --> 04:52.424
about stepping in
to rule England.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.293
If we can find
real evidence of this,

04:54.295 --> 04:55.627
and I can get it to Elizabeth,
she will be forced

04:55.629 --> 04:57.729
to rescind her offer
to name you her successor.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.765
Well, that would be
taking quite a risk.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.634
Lest you forget, I also have
a duty to Elizabeth.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.404
By stopping the Vatican's plot,
I save my queen's life.

05:06.974 --> 05:10.809
I would take this risk,
even if it weren't my duty.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.880
We will stop the Vatican,

05:14.882 --> 05:18.750
but to start,
we must find Joseph Tudor.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.420
¶ ¶

05:28.629 --> 05:29.895
I trust your visit
to Mary's chambers

05:29.897 --> 05:31.897
was to end your liaison.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.933
Now that she's my fiancée,
your mission to seduce her

05:34.935 --> 05:36.368
is obsolete.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.469
Well, Mary will be devastated.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.503
It seems I'm quite good

05:38.505 --> 05:39.671
at my job.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.039
Drawing women in,

05:41.041 --> 05:43.408
seducing them,
learning their every secret.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.477
But you already knew that,
didn't you,

05:45.479 --> 05:46.578
given my time with Elizabeth.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.580
Stay away
from the queen of Scots.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.882
Is that
the queen of England's order?

05:50.884 --> 05:53.118
No, that's my order
as the Earl of Leicester

05:53.120 --> 05:55.387
and the future
king consort of Scotland.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.558
CATHERINE:<i> Joseph Tudor</i>

05:59.560 --> 06:00.859
appealed to us for asylum

06:00.861 --> 06:02.794
when Elizabeth took the throne,

06:02.796 --> 06:04.129
and started persecuting all

06:04.131 --> 06:06.131
of Mary Tudor's
Catholic supporters.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.799
As we are
a Catholic monarchy,

06:07.801 --> 06:10.836
Henry granted him sanctuary
here in France.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.637
Since when did you
become interested

06:12.639 --> 06:14.539
in the whereabouts
of a distant cousin?

06:14.541 --> 06:16.675
It's a theory
I'm working on with Gideon.

06:16.677 --> 06:20.045
How are things
with the English ambassador?

06:20.047 --> 06:22.547
I know you.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.616
You've come to care for him,
correct?

06:24.618 --> 06:26.118
Perhaps a little.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.720
But I have bigger worries.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.155
I came to ask you

06:30.157 --> 06:31.423
about Archbishop Ridolfi.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.625
Has he had any visitors?

06:33.627 --> 06:36.395
No, he's been too busy
borrowing the royal carriages,

06:36.397 --> 06:38.830
for what he calls
"holy errands."

06:38.832 --> 06:40.966
Do you know where
he's been going?
No.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.969
But his drivers loathe him.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.904
I'm sure they'd share
that information with you.

06:47.141 --> 06:48.707
What are you up to, Mary?

06:48.709 --> 06:50.976
It's best you remain unaware.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.580
(indistinct shouting,
dog barking)

07:00.888 --> 07:02.788
GIDEON:
Joseph Tudor?

07:02.790 --> 07:04.089
Who's asking?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.891
I have a message
from Archbishop Ridolfi.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.592
It's about time.
Did he say

07:07.594 --> 07:10.061
how much longer I'm to stay
in this dreadful house?

07:10.063 --> 07:11.463
It's ridiculous.

07:11.465 --> 07:12.798
A man of my future standing.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.567
Why don't we discuss
that future inside?

07:20.641 --> 07:21.573
(grunts, thuds)

07:26.780 --> 07:30.048
Thomas and I like the name Logan
for a boy and Fiona

07:30.050 --> 07:31.616
for a girl.
No.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.985
Your choices are
far too Scottish for a child

07:33.987 --> 07:35.053
growing up in France.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.021
We want the child to fit in,

07:36.023 --> 07:37.722
don't we?

07:37.724 --> 07:39.791
Lord Thomas, for you.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.629
What is it?

07:44.631 --> 07:45.964
Someone knows.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.932
Somehow they knew.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.134
It says that

07:49.136 --> 07:51.036
your pregnancy is a ruse.
That the mother

07:51.038 --> 07:52.504
is your sister,

07:52.506 --> 07:54.072
a "purveyor of whores."

07:54.074 --> 07:55.574
They're demanding gold
for their silence.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.741
We are being blackmailed?

07:56.743 --> 07:58.743
How did the secret get out?

07:58.745 --> 08:01.746
I've been so careful,
barely coming out of my room.

08:01.748 --> 08:04.049
We should all leave town
until the baby's born.
Once that happens,

08:04.051 --> 08:05.650
the blackmailer will
have no way to prove

08:05.652 --> 08:07.085
that we aren't
the real parents.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.637
I'd rather not go.

08:08.638 --> 08:10.188
It puts my business at risk,
for one thing.

08:10.190 --> 08:13.492
And traveling now,
I'm not sure that's wise.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.227
The point of pretending
this baby is yours

08:15.229 --> 08:17.662
is to give it a chance
to grow up with a good name.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.865
For its sake and yours,

08:19.867 --> 08:22.000
we have to agree
to the blackmailer's terms.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.870
Perhaps they'll take the money
and go away.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.605
And if they press
for more, well,

08:26.607 --> 08:28.940
then we might have a better idea

08:28.942 --> 08:31.109
of who we're dealing with.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.144
BASH:
<i> Catherine,</i>

08:33.146 --> 08:34.613
an update.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.849
Charles has been apprised
of the situation

08:37.851 --> 08:39.551
with the Red Knights.

08:39.553 --> 08:42.687
Your assailants were last seen
riding east from the castle.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.155
My men have searched
the nearby villages,

08:44.157 --> 08:46.057
but they seem
to have vanished.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.059
Well, someone threw
that pike at me.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.895
CHARLES: Is it possible
the families

08:49.896 --> 08:51.730
of the original Red Knights
are involved?

08:51.732 --> 08:52.764
They had no families.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.733
Henry only recruited orphans,

08:54.735 --> 08:57.802
training them as boys
to ensure their loyalty.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.038
And once they came of age, they
had to take oaths of celibacy.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.239
Well, you couldn't
have expected them

09:01.241 --> 09:02.541
to uphold those vows.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.875
I didn't.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.277
Which is why I discreetly

09:05.279 --> 09:07.846
incentivized them with sex.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.080
For every battle won,

09:09.082 --> 09:10.615
the Knights,
they had their choice

09:10.617 --> 09:12.117
of my finest courtesans.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.552
Trust me, they won often.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.786
So it is possible

09:14.788 --> 09:17.622
one of them
fathered a child.

09:17.624 --> 09:20.992
(sighs) I suppose
it's worth investigating.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.894
And I know exactly

09:22.896 --> 09:25.931
where you can go to find out.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.737
Would you like to try
some sipping chocolate?

09:32.739 --> 09:34.339
It's from Spain.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.007
Catherine's daughter,
the queen,

09:36.009 --> 09:38.109
has it sent specially for us.

09:38.111 --> 09:41.146
Catherine does seem to treat
her former courtesans well.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.148
Our reward for a job well done.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.816
Did she send you to us

09:44.818 --> 09:46.651
for something special, then?

09:46.653 --> 09:48.753
(chuckles)
No, no, I'm here on business.

09:48.755 --> 09:49.888
Oh, you sure?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.022
I may be retired.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.157
I'm not dead.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.759
(laughs)
I'm sure.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.028
It's actually quite serious.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.598
There was an attempt made
on the queen mother's life.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.166
We believe
it was someone seeking revenge

10:01.168 --> 10:02.367
on behalf
of the Red Knights.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.335
They're heretics.

10:03.337 --> 10:04.703
They didn't just turn

10:04.705 --> 10:05.837
against the monarchy,

10:05.839 --> 10:07.939
they turned against God.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.376
Catherine revealed
that many of the women here

10:11.378 --> 10:14.045
entertained these men
before their beliefs were known.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.314
And you want to know if any
of us bore their children.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.049
We are no common whores.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.218
We were trained to abide

10:20.220 --> 10:21.620
by strict rules.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.955
The most important being
never get pregnant.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.758
I'm afraid you've come
all this way for nothing.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.226
Thank you.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.097
You overheard me

10:32.099 --> 10:33.131
talking about the Red Knights.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.265
I should go.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.134
Is there anything
you can tell me?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.869
Any information could help.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.271
I fear you may be looking
for my son.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.240
A child fathered
by a Red Knight?

10:42.242 --> 10:44.275
I fell in love
with one of those men.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.111
When I discovered
I was with child,

10:46.113 --> 10:47.212
I left court.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.647
I wanted to keep the baby,

10:48.649 --> 10:50.415
but when the Knights
were revealed to be

10:50.417 --> 10:52.817
Devil worshippers...

10:52.819 --> 10:54.085
What did you do?

10:54.087 --> 10:55.320
I had the baby.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.189
And left him

10:58.191 --> 11:00.291
and any belongings I had
of his blasphemous father

11:00.293 --> 11:02.961
to die in the woods near Dijon.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.996
I have felt nothing since

11:04.998 --> 11:06.698
but guilt and remorse.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.099
For leaving the child.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.002
For giving birth
to Satan's spawn.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.103
I brought a monster

11:12.105 --> 11:13.838
into this world.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.674
What if he still lives?

11:15.676 --> 11:17.175
I assure you,

11:17.177 --> 11:18.443
if your child
is still alive,

11:18.445 --> 11:20.378
he is no monster.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.180
Only a man.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.214
(growls)

11:23.216 --> 11:25.150
(crowd cheering)

11:27.287 --> 11:28.887
(grunting)

11:28.889 --> 11:31.056
(bellowing)

11:43.737 --> 11:44.836
(groans)

11:48.008 --> 11:49.874
(cheering)

11:49.876 --> 11:51.076
(bellowing)

11:54.147 --> 11:55.947
Are you sure this is the man?

11:55.949 --> 11:57.415
He was found abandoned
in the nearby woods

11:57.417 --> 11:58.917
as a suckling infant.

11:58.919 --> 12:02.153
CROWD (cheering):
Geant!

12:02.155 --> 12:05.123
(cheering continues)

12:05.125 --> 12:06.825
(door opens)

12:06.827 --> 12:08.093
You were right.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.228
The Vatican brought Joseph Tudor
from Saint-Veran

12:10.230 --> 12:12.230
and rented a house for him
in the village.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.832
That's where
Archbishop Ridolfi's

12:13.834 --> 12:15.300
been holding secret meetings
to negotiate

12:15.302 --> 12:17.102
his ascension
to the English throne.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.837
So Joseph Tudor is complicit.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.472
In searching his house,

12:20.474 --> 12:22.807
I found damning correspondence
between him

12:22.809 --> 12:25.844
and the Vatican.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.179
This says the Vatican
was going to pressure me

12:28.181 --> 12:29.881
into naming Joseph Tudor
as my successor

12:29.883 --> 12:30.882
to the English throne.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.417
Yes.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.186
Joseph was already reaching out
to prominent,

12:35.188 --> 12:37.021
Catholic English nobles
in an effort

12:37.023 --> 12:39.891
to consolidate support
for the Vatican's plan.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.459
He wanted to be king,
at the cost of your life.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.261
And what if the Vatican
says these are forgeries?

12:43.263 --> 12:44.529
I'll bring Joseph
to England with me,

12:44.531 --> 12:46.297
where I will get
a confession out of him.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.867
He's being held on a ship
awaiting my return.

12:48.869 --> 12:52.036
I sail tonight.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.204
Elizabeth will be alerted

12:53.206 --> 12:55.907
to the Vatican's plot
against her.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.342
She will never think
you were involved

12:57.344 --> 12:58.843
in any way, as none of it

12:58.845 --> 13:00.478
will tie back to you.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.282
I know I said that nothing real
could ever happen between us...

13:05.552 --> 13:07.852
...but it has.

13:11.091 --> 13:14.292
I have come
to care for you, Gideon.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.227
Then why do you seem so sad?

13:16.229 --> 13:18.797
Even if our plan works,

13:18.799 --> 13:22.567
(sighs) and my engagement
to Dudley is called off...

13:22.569 --> 13:26.938
I'm not so foolish as to think
I will end up with a queen.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.840
I understand the reality
of our stations.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.342
We are loyal to
two different countries.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.478
But there's
something else I know.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.280
Life is short.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.481
At this point,
I thought I would be

13:36.483 --> 13:39.417
raising my daughter
with my wife by my side.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.352
Instead, I-I've only
just met my child,

13:41.354 --> 13:43.254
and my wife is gone.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.123
The best I can do
is live day by day.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.958
If something feels right,

13:46.960 --> 13:50.161
I embrace it.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.263
And being with you
on this particular day,

13:52.265 --> 13:54.566
it feels very right.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.274
(horse whinnies, dogs barking)

14:05.278 --> 14:07.212
That's him.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.346
That's the man I saw entering
Master Tudor's house.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.281
What's the meaning of this?

14:10.283 --> 14:12.016
This boy works for Joseph Tudor.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.017
He was on his way
to fetch firewood

14:13.019 --> 14:14.452
and saw you enter the house.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.020
When the boy returned,
he found the place ransacked

14:16.022 --> 14:17.455
and Joseph gone.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.591
He is mistaken.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.893
I saw him,
dressed as a priest.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.361
Guard, take Ambassador Blackburn

14:23.363 --> 14:25.864
into custody.
On what grounds?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.432
You were the last person
to be seen with Joseph Tudor,

14:27.434 --> 14:28.499
and now he is missing.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.139
Stop fighting us,
or you will regret it.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.377
This is outrageous.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.378
You have nothing but conjecture.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.380
Then produce Joseph Tudor.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.216
If you can't, the Vatican
must assume you killed him

14:45.218 --> 14:47.285
and will be charged with murder.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.162
Leith.

14:58.164 --> 14:59.964
Thank you for coming.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.967
I had a meeting with a wool
trader in the village anyway.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.370
Is that so? What for?

15:05.372 --> 15:07.205
I'm trying to strike
out on my own.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.240
Raise my station by breaking
into the merchant class.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.342
Good for you.
Yes.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.378
Except I haven't any experience,

15:13.380 --> 15:15.480
so no one wants to take
a chance on me.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.482
I'm what they call
an unproven entity.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.451
Maybe you just haven't
met the right person yet.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.420
Maybe, but I've met

15:22.422 --> 15:24.455
with everyone I know,
and so far nothing.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.024
I'm sorry.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.458
Why did you want to see me?

15:27.460 --> 15:29.260
I need your help.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.695
But first,

15:30.697 --> 15:32.964
I have to show you something.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.237
(gate opening)

15:39.239 --> 15:41.272
(horse whinnies)

15:43.410 --> 15:44.575
PAGE:
I'll take him, my lord.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.411
Well?

15:46.413 --> 15:48.079
The wool merchant
turned me down.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.580
Another opportunity
will come along.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.182
I'm sure it will.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.284
In the meantime,
we have a romantic getaway

15:53.286 --> 15:54.385
to Paris to look forward to.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.553
I can't go.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.388
Oh, come on.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.190
You've been so busy trying
to build a business,

15:59.192 --> 16:00.491
we haven't spent
any time together.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.726
I miss you.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.361
I know, I'm sorry.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.395
I promised Greer

16:04.397 --> 16:06.464
I would do her a favor.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.299
A favor.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.667
For your ex.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.437
Versus Paris with me.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.972
Your lover.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.373
Your princess lover.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.408
I assure you,
it is out of friendship.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.610
(sighs)

16:19.612 --> 16:21.012
(whispering):
Greer is pregnant.

16:21.014 --> 16:22.046
No.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.581
Who's the father?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.183
A pirate.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.151
Greer is having a pirate-baby?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.286
Don't call it that.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.387
Don't call it anything.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.455
It's a secret.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.756
Greer plans to give
the child away

16:31.758 --> 16:33.491
before anyone's the wiser,

16:33.493 --> 16:35.393
but somebody's learned
the truth of her plans

16:35.395 --> 16:36.494
and is blackmailing her.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.495
That's so sad and awful.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.496
We have to help her.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.430
"We"?

16:39.432 --> 16:40.498
Yeah.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.133
Greer has asked
that I covertly

16:42.135 --> 16:43.301
follow her brother-in-law

16:43.303 --> 16:44.535
when he drops off the money,

16:44.537 --> 16:46.304
so that I can expose
the perpetrator

16:46.306 --> 16:48.139
and stop this threat for good.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.540
You really want to help?

16:49.542 --> 16:51.042
Of course.

16:51.044 --> 16:54.012
Besides, this is
a fantastic adventure.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.546
Better than stuffy old Paris.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.049
Were you seriously
not planning on asking me

16:58.051 --> 16:59.417
to be part of the fun?

16:59.419 --> 17:01.252
Claude, I don't think
it will be much fun.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.621
Well, I can be of great use,
because if you're skulking

17:03.623 --> 17:05.256
through the village
streets alone,

17:05.258 --> 17:07.225
Greer's brother-in law
will spot you straight away.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.460
But, if you're
getting henpecked

17:09.462 --> 17:10.461
by some horrid fishwife...

17:10.463 --> 17:11.729
Some horrid fishwife?

17:11.731 --> 17:13.231
Of the many useless

17:13.233 --> 17:14.565
"ladies arts"
I was forced to study--

17:14.567 --> 17:17.101
needlework, harpsichord
and the like--

17:17.103 --> 17:19.504
there was one
in which I excelled--

17:19.506 --> 17:21.506
theater.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.275
To pull off this enterprise,
you need an actor.

17:24.277 --> 17:27.311
And that, my darling, is me.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.748
Unless Gideon can prove
that Joseph Tudor is alive,

17:30.750 --> 17:32.316
the Vatican will hold him
for murder.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.518
I had no choice

17:33.520 --> 17:35.119
but to let them lock Gideon

17:35.121 --> 17:36.587
in the dungeon.
Catherine, no.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.822
I need Gideon.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.191
Without him,
my plans fall apart.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.793
Are these the plans that
I'm best to remain unaware of?

17:41.795 --> 17:43.327
Your words, not mine.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.730
Tell me, or I can not help you.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.300
My theory was right.

17:49.302 --> 17:52.203
Once they have done away
with Elizabeth and installed me

17:52.205 --> 17:54.205
as the new queen of England,
the Vatican planned

17:54.207 --> 17:56.541
to position Joseph Tudor
to replace me.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.809
They're making you, a woman,

17:57.811 --> 18:00.311
do the dirty work
to benefit a bunch

18:00.313 --> 18:02.413
of spineless men.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.215
Gideon has kidnapped Joseph.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.684
He is going to present him
to Elizabeth to expose the plot.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.287
It's the only way
to convince Elizabeth.

18:09.289 --> 18:13.124
to change her mind
about naming me her successor.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.626
Something which won't happen
as long as Gideon is locked up.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.695
And you can not go
to Elizabeth with this.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.597
The fact that I would benefit
from her death

18:19.599 --> 18:22.433
by sitting on the English throne
is enough to convince her

18:22.435 --> 18:23.601
that I would be
a willing participant.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.436
No one close to me

18:25.437 --> 18:27.270
at French court
can expose the plot either.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.706
She'll still think
you're behind it.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.609
However, there is one
recent arrival

18:31.611 --> 18:33.244
to France who can help.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.246
Someone who is trusted
by Elizabeth

18:35.248 --> 18:36.681
and would do anything

18:36.683 --> 18:38.749
to protect his queen.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.687
(door opens)

18:43.890 --> 18:45.556
Dudley.

18:45.558 --> 18:46.757
What is the meaning
of this note?

18:48.261 --> 18:50.328
"Visit me in the dungeon.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.630
"You are the only one
who can save our queen.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.565
"I need you to take the risk,

18:54.567 --> 18:56.400
even if it is not your duty."

18:59.873 --> 19:03.307
The Vatican plans
to kill Elizabeth.
What?

19:03.309 --> 19:05.710
They want a Catholic English
royal to ascend the throne.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.645
Because the Vatican
doesn't want this plot revealed,

19:07.647 --> 19:09.413
they're accusing me of murder.

19:09.415 --> 19:10.648
But Mary is to be named
Elizabeth's successor.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.649
The queen of Scots

19:11.651 --> 19:14.152
is an oblivious pawn.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.419
A seat warmer
until the Vatican

19:15.421 --> 19:17.321
can place a king
on the English throne.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.656
I found evidence
which confirms

19:18.658 --> 19:20.892
their choice
is Joseph Tudor.

19:20.894 --> 19:22.493
It's between two stone planters

19:22.495 --> 19:24.228
in the southwest corner
of the courtyard.

19:24.230 --> 19:27.198
Now get it
and make your way to the docks.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.167
There is a ship
set to sail later tonight.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.701
Now Tudor is being
held on board.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.336
You must go to England

19:32.338 --> 19:34.272
in my stead and put both him

19:34.274 --> 19:35.640
and those documents
in front of Elizabeth.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.441
And I'm to return to a country

19:37.443 --> 19:39.810
where I am scorned, challenged
to duels in the streets?

19:39.812 --> 19:42.547
You will return having
uncovered an assassination plot.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.782
Not only are you saving
the woman you love,

19:44.784 --> 19:46.217
but this will work towards
giving you something

19:46.219 --> 19:47.685
I imagine you very much seek...

19:48.721 --> 19:50.221
...a second chance in England.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.389
Give Mary an excuse

19:51.391 --> 19:53.925
why you must
leave court and go.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.860
I bet you've never done
a thing in your life

19:55.862 --> 19:57.828
which didn't
also benefit yourself.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.197
(scoffs)

19:59.199 --> 20:00.798
So what is it now?

20:03.369 --> 20:05.703
I understand why you have
this opinion of me.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.805
But the truth is,
when I am in service to a queen,

20:07.807 --> 20:10.241
I am in service to a queen.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.643
It was true with
Elizabeth's predecessor,

20:12.645 --> 20:14.545
and it's true
with Elizabeth now.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.813
I'm trying to save her life,

20:15.815 --> 20:17.481
and I'm asking you to help me!

20:19.752 --> 20:21.385
I'll do it.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.725
(wincing)

20:31.898 --> 20:33.898
I apologize for the blade,

20:33.900 --> 20:36.267
but I've seen the destruction
you can cause, Geant,

20:36.269 --> 20:37.802
and I am in need of answers.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.438
Where were you
three nights ago?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.440
In the ring.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.709
Fighting before
a crowd of a hundred.

20:44.711 --> 20:47.845
What is this about?

20:49.616 --> 20:50.648
Your father...

20:50.650 --> 20:52.917
what do you know of him?

20:52.919 --> 20:54.885
Nothing.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.888
You wear his helmet.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.891
All I have of a man
that I've never met.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.893
But more than I got
from my mother,

21:02.895 --> 21:06.564
whose only gift was to leave me
to die in the woods.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.367
You've become something of
a legend in the sparring pits.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.569
Ah, people love
a good battle.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.338
But if you've been sent
to try and recruit me

21:14.340 --> 21:16.040
because of that damn helmet...

21:17.377 --> 21:20.711
...again, the answer is no.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.913
Who tried to recruit you?

21:22.915 --> 21:24.882
Some men approached me recently,

21:24.884 --> 21:26.550
having heard of a champion
who fights

21:26.552 --> 21:27.785
wearing a Red Knights' helmet.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.754
They asked me
to join their cause,

21:29.756 --> 21:32.323
revenge on the queen mother.
(sighs)

21:33.426 --> 21:35.459
And what was your response?

21:35.461 --> 21:38.729
I sent them on their way.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.732
I see no point in avenging
a father I never knew.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.434
Can you give me any details
about these men

21:43.436 --> 21:45.303
that might reveal
their identities?

21:45.305 --> 21:47.705
Highborn? Lowborn?

21:47.707 --> 21:48.773
One man wore a ruby ring.

21:48.775 --> 21:49.940
He said he'd give it to me

21:49.942 --> 21:51.876
if I'd join their cause.
(horse whinnies)

21:55.014 --> 21:56.447
(grunts)

21:59.552 --> 22:01.018
(horse whinnies)

22:03.489 --> 22:05.523
(grunts)

22:09.362 --> 22:11.028
(groaning)

22:17.470 --> 22:19.403
You've been threatening
Catherine de Medici from afar,

22:19.405 --> 22:20.971
claiming to be the Red Knights.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.908
Well, now you're going
to face the woman herself.

22:23.910 --> 22:24.909
(groans)

22:30.817 --> 22:32.817
LOLA:<i> After Mary's nuptials</i>
<i> to Robert Dudley,</i>

22:32.819 --> 22:34.719
will you be inviting her
to English court?

22:34.721 --> 22:37.355
Why do you ask?

22:37.357 --> 22:38.956
The more time I spend
by your side,

22:38.958 --> 22:40.791
the more I think
you two might get on.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.860
Not to mention,
it would be a great opportunity

22:42.862 --> 22:44.995
to show the world
you are two queens united.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.797
You must miss your friend.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.900
I do.

22:53.639 --> 22:54.772
What are you doing here?

22:54.774 --> 22:56.073
<i> All of you</i>

22:56.075 --> 22:58.809
pressured me
to pick a successor,

22:58.811 --> 23:01.112
for the good of the realm.

23:01.114 --> 23:03.047
And against my better judgment,

23:03.049 --> 23:04.682
I did.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.617
The only good to come of this

23:06.619 --> 23:09.887
was my decision to send
Robert Dudley to French court.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.088
Because while he was there,

23:11.090 --> 23:13.891
he uncovered a Vatican plot
to kill me.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.527
But that was not to be
the end of their plan.

23:16.529 --> 23:19.163
After Elizabeth's successor,
Mary Stuart, took the throne,

23:19.165 --> 23:21.832
the Vatican intended
to let the queen of Scots fall,

23:21.834 --> 23:23.901
in order to install
a Catholic king,

23:23.903 --> 23:26.437
an Englishman
with a claim to the throne

23:26.439 --> 23:27.938
and an eagerness to have it.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.106
That man is Joseph Tudor.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.775
ELIZABETH:
This is the fault

23:30.777 --> 23:33.544
of everyone in this room.

23:33.546 --> 23:36.881
Forcing me to open the door
to the possibility

23:36.883 --> 23:38.549
that even a queen

23:38.551 --> 23:40.451
can be replaced.

23:40.453 --> 23:41.485
COUNCIL MEMBER:
Certainly you aren't suggesting

23:41.487 --> 23:43.087
we go up
against the Vatican?

23:43.089 --> 23:45.623
To accuse them outright
would be to declare war.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.793
No, Joseph Tudor
will be blamed for this.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.028
The traitor has been
brought home to England,

23:51.030 --> 23:53.931
where I have ordered him
to be drawn and quartered.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.933
That will serve
as an example

23:55.935 --> 23:57.067
to anyone

23:57.069 --> 23:59.603
who dare threaten my reign.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.939
We all owe a show of gratitude

24:01.941 --> 24:03.874
to Robert Dudley,

24:03.876 --> 24:05.810
the Earl of Leicester.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.819
(weakly):
Hail Dudley.

24:14.821 --> 24:17.221
ALL:
Hail Dudley!

24:17.223 --> 24:19.056
As for Mary Stuart,

24:19.058 --> 24:21.559
I am rescinding my offer.

24:21.561 --> 24:25.596
I shall never name an heir,
unless it is my own child.

24:25.598 --> 24:27.932
To name a successor

24:27.934 --> 24:31.001
is to place a target on oneself.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.204
And so long as I live,

24:33.206 --> 24:35.906
<i> I</i> shall be
the queen of England.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.675
And when I am dead,

24:37.677 --> 24:41.512
whoever has the most right
shall succeed me.

24:41.514 --> 24:43.714
MARY:
<i> It worked.</i>

24:43.716 --> 24:46.183
Elizabeth has rescinded her
offer to name me her successor.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.185
She attributes
the entire plot

24:48.187 --> 24:49.987
to Joseph Tudor,
who has been executed.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.956
Does the Vatican suspect
you were involved?

24:51.958 --> 24:53.023
I kept them in the dark.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.059
I gave Archbishop Ridolfi
the news.

24:55.061 --> 24:57.027
He assured me that
I continue to have

24:57.029 --> 24:59.563
the Vatican's full support
for my return to Scotland.

24:59.565 --> 25:00.764
That is wonderful,

25:00.766 --> 25:03.601
as is knowing you are
no longer engaged.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.503
I guess I'll be expected
to continue my duty

25:05.505 --> 25:06.770
to seduce you.

25:06.772 --> 25:08.672
so you don't make
another marriage alliance.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.510
What is it?

25:12.512 --> 25:13.844
The Vatican knows
they've been caught.

25:13.846 --> 25:14.945
They want to punish someone,

25:14.947 --> 25:16.547
and that someone is you.

25:16.549 --> 25:17.815
But Dudley claimed credit

25:17.817 --> 25:19.049
for absconding
with Joseph Tudor.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.117
That's why the Vatican
were forced

25:20.119 --> 25:22.052
to drop their charge
against me.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.888
They are convinced that you
were Dudley's accomplice

25:23.890 --> 25:25.289
in undermining their plot.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.957
What jurisdiction
does the Church have in France?

25:26.959 --> 25:28.192
None, which is why

25:28.194 --> 25:30.294
the Archbishop is going
to approach the regent

25:30.296 --> 25:32.062
and ask her to hand you over.

25:32.064 --> 25:34.265
Hand me over?
The Vatican wants

25:34.267 --> 25:36.567
to take you to Rome,
put you on trial,

25:36.569 --> 25:37.835
and have you hanged

25:37.837 --> 25:39.737
for acts of aggression
against the Faith.

25:39.739 --> 25:42.840
They have no evidence but for a
testimony from some servant boy.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.542
They will create evidence.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.277
This can't be happening.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.648
I need to take my daughter,
and... and... and leave.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.049
With your best horses, we can
make it to the Netherlands

25:52.051 --> 25:53.551
in a few days time.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.019
If you escape,
and then you are caught,

25:55.021 --> 25:57.121
it will only solidify
the impression of your guilt.

25:57.123 --> 26:00.124
I will talk to the one person
who can save your life.

26:00.126 --> 26:01.692
I don't give my heart
or give up easily.

26:01.694 --> 26:03.093
We won't end like this.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.029
Not with your death.

26:10.603 --> 26:13.137
CATHERINE: The king's deputy,
Sebastian, who captured you,

26:13.139 --> 26:15.839
believes there's an informant
in the king's guard.

26:15.841 --> 26:17.074
Is that true?

26:25.084 --> 26:25.983
Who told you about

26:25.985 --> 26:28.819
our investigation in Dijon?

26:31.290 --> 26:32.790
If you think
you're not going to talk,

26:32.792 --> 26:35.593
you are mistaken.

26:35.595 --> 26:38.028
(sighs)

26:39.932 --> 26:42.132
(yells)

26:42.134 --> 26:43.634
Do you have other agents

26:43.636 --> 26:44.835
who infiltrated the castle?

26:44.837 --> 26:46.971
Only time will tell.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.006
Ah, he speaks.

26:49.008 --> 26:51.675
What is your connection
to the original Red Knights?

26:51.677 --> 26:53.243
Who are your conspirators?

26:58.884 --> 27:00.184
(screaming)

27:00.186 --> 27:02.186
Answer and the pain will stop.

27:03.689 --> 27:05.923
Christophe, our friend here
doesn't seem

27:05.925 --> 27:07.791
too attached
to his hands.

27:07.793 --> 27:10.661
Let's see how he feels
about his eyes.

27:12.365 --> 27:14.064
Have you heard
of Spirits of Salts?

27:14.066 --> 27:17.067
It's used to etch designs
into metal

27:17.069 --> 27:18.969
by corroding it.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.237
Imagine what one drop can do

27:20.239 --> 27:22.039
to a human eye.

27:22.041 --> 27:25.042
Did you frame me
for poisoning Francis?

27:25.044 --> 27:27.044
Was Cardinal Morel
one of yours?

27:27.046 --> 27:28.245
(groaning)

27:32.084 --> 27:33.283
(screaming)

27:33.285 --> 27:36.086
How do you plan to destroy me?!

27:36.088 --> 27:38.322
(screaming)

27:42.194 --> 27:43.961
Destroy you?

27:43.963 --> 27:45.362
This is about destroying

27:45.364 --> 27:47.097
the entire House of Valois.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.400
Your corrupt rule is in

27:49.402 --> 27:51.001
its final days.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.206
There's a reason
I saved you one eye.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.809
So when I open up
your chest,

27:58.811 --> 28:00.277
you can see
your own beating heart.

28:01.914 --> 28:04.281
Your boy seems
to like this work.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.118
Your answers can stop him.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.721
(panting) Never.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.456
I will not be the first
to die

28:12.458 --> 28:13.924
for this cause,

28:13.926 --> 28:15.225
nor the last.

28:15.227 --> 28:18.162
We are legion.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.266
Christophe.

28:31.010 --> 28:33.177
If the gold was to be
dropped in a vacant room

28:33.179 --> 28:35.079
at the inn down the street,
why is Thomas at a tavern?

28:35.081 --> 28:37.047
Maybe he needed a drink
to calm his nerves.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.482
He hasn't ordered one yet.

28:38.484 --> 28:41.251
He seems awfully calm.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.120
Making fast friends.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.188
I'm sure it's nothing.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.322
Well, I don't like it.

28:45.324 --> 28:46.924
We need to hear what
they're up to.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.127
What's that?

28:50.129 --> 28:51.762
I'm going over there.

28:51.764 --> 28:52.996
No, Claude, wait.

28:55.367 --> 28:56.767
Some ale, gentlemen?

28:56.769 --> 28:59.036
No.
Oh, but ours is world famous.

28:59.038 --> 29:01.105
King Charles once came
in for a pint.

29:01.107 --> 29:02.172
Oh!

29:02.174 --> 29:05.109
Oh, I'm so sorry.

29:05.111 --> 29:05.909
Clumsy me.

29:09.315 --> 29:11.482
Uh, get away from us,
you wench.

29:11.484 --> 29:13.250
A thousand pardons.

29:13.252 --> 29:16.286
We need to stop
that transaction.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.122
Greer's brother-in-law
isn't being blackmailed at all.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.058
LEITH: Your brother-in-law
was buying a château

29:21.060 --> 29:23.460
in Switzerland
with your money.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.295
Thank you, Leith.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.264
If you could return my gold
to the counting house,

29:27.266 --> 29:29.266
I'll handle it from here.

29:32.004 --> 29:34.171
Were you planning to move away
without telling me?

29:34.173 --> 29:37.307
Take my baby
under the cover of night?

29:37.309 --> 29:38.876
I wasn't taking your baby.

29:38.878 --> 29:41.278
I was saving it
from this moral cesspool.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.148
The blackmailer lectures me
on morality?

29:44.150 --> 29:46.150
It was my idea, Greer.

29:46.152 --> 29:48.986
I convinced Thomas to do it.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.921
You?

29:50.923 --> 29:53.056
After all
I have done for you,

29:53.058 --> 29:54.491
you were going to raise my child

29:54.493 --> 29:56.193
in another country
without telling me?

29:56.195 --> 29:58.162
Was this your plan all along?

29:58.164 --> 30:01.331
No. We arrived with the best
of intentions.

30:01.333 --> 30:05.202
This was my opportunity
to finally become a mother,

30:05.204 --> 30:08.539
and of course I wanted you to be
involved in the child's life,

30:08.541 --> 30:11.341
but I realized
you were never going to let go.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.309
Not really.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.945
And there was no me
or Thomas.

30:14.947 --> 30:17.948
Just you, as the mother,
as the provider,

30:17.950 --> 30:19.316
as the decision-maker.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.051
Not as the doting aunt,

30:21.053 --> 30:23.120
as you initially promised.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.888
Greer, I wanted a baby,

30:24.890 --> 30:28.192
not a job
as your baby's governess.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.960
Then why didn't
you say something?

30:29.962 --> 30:31.962
I said it a hundred ways

30:31.964 --> 30:34.364
but you never heard me.

30:34.366 --> 30:36.366
You wouldn't even
let me name my child.

30:36.368 --> 30:39.136
I was willing to give up
so much

30:39.138 --> 30:40.537
for you.

30:40.539 --> 30:43.507
But now I want you
out of my life forever.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.910
I can protect this child.

30:46.912 --> 30:48.412
How?

30:48.414 --> 30:51.548
It will always be the bastard
of a fallen lady.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.550
It will be spat upon.

30:53.552 --> 30:56.086
Thomas and I,
we lied to you.

30:56.088 --> 30:59.423
Yes. But we would have given
this baby

30:59.425 --> 31:00.891
a better home.

31:00.893 --> 31:03.026
Compared to you,
almost anyone would.

31:04.163 --> 31:05.963
Get out.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.140
CATHERINE:
<i> You ask me</i>

31:17.142 --> 31:18.976
to defy the Vatican.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.511
I am asking the regent of France
to save Gideon's life.

31:21.513 --> 31:23.380
He protected me

31:23.382 --> 31:24.648
from Vatican control,

31:24.650 --> 31:27.117
and from Elizabeth's
potential wrath.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.421
There may be a way to help him.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.023
I am under attack

31:33.025 --> 31:36.360
by a rogue group calling
themselves the Red Knights.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.996
And my best general,

31:38.998 --> 31:40.063
imprisoned in England,

31:40.065 --> 31:41.465
could be of great help to me.

31:41.467 --> 31:42.933
General Gaghan.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.334
Francis' godfather.

31:44.336 --> 31:47.437
Hmm, he's been devoted
to this family.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.306
He was captured
while fighting in Scotland

31:49.308 --> 31:51.275
during the
Battle of Restalrig.

31:51.277 --> 31:53.410
I can offer Elizabeth
a prisoner swap.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.480
Gideon in exchange for Gaghan.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.649
The only solution
you can come up is one

31:58.651 --> 32:00.584
that serves
your own purposes?

32:00.586 --> 32:03.453
You've worked hard to preserve
the Vatican's support

32:03.455 --> 32:05.022
for your return to Scotland.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.591
And while I am glad that you
have opened yourself up

32:07.593 --> 32:09.426
emotionally to Gideon,

32:09.428 --> 32:12.429
do not let those emotions
cloud your judgment.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.398
But I will lose him.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.002
Then I leave
the decision to you.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.542
Make the trade.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.185
ELIZABETH:
What are your plans now that
you're no longer engaged?

32:35.187 --> 32:37.187
DUDLEY:
I don't know-- I didn't think
it would be up to me.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.322
It seems that
the queen's been making most

32:38.324 --> 32:40.524
of my life decisions of late.

32:46.165 --> 32:49.132
Catherine de Medici
requests the release

32:49.134 --> 32:51.468
of General Gaghan
from the Tower.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.737
In exchange, she will allow
Gideon Blackburn,

32:53.739 --> 32:56.573
suspected enemy of the
Catholic Church and France,

32:56.575 --> 32:58.408
to return to England.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.043
If not,
she will hand him over

33:00.045 --> 33:02.612
to the Vatican,
and he will hang in Rome.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.481
I thought he was a free man.

33:04.483 --> 33:05.983
Who somehow infuriated the Pope.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.617
I guess he can't
charm everyone.

33:07.619 --> 33:10.087
He's your ambassador, Elizabeth.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.321
You're just gonna let him die?

33:11.323 --> 33:14.624
I sent him to France
to woo Mary.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.026
He's more a male prostitute

33:16.028 --> 33:18.161
than a master of diplomacy.

33:18.163 --> 33:19.529
What?

33:19.531 --> 33:21.365
You loathe him.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.333
Besides, I'm not
about to trade him

33:23.335 --> 33:24.534
for a general
who commanded a battalion

33:24.536 --> 33:26.336
that killed hundreds
of my soldiers.

33:26.338 --> 33:29.606
The trade is completely uneven.

33:29.608 --> 33:32.142
I can't believe I'm saying this,

33:32.144 --> 33:33.210
but you should

33:33.212 --> 33:34.478
agree to the trade.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.280
It was Gideon who uncovered

33:37.282 --> 33:39.282
the Vatican plot
against you, not me.

33:39.284 --> 33:42.119
Gideon stayed true
to his ambassador's mission.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.254
He protected you and the realm.

33:44.256 --> 33:47.124
You can thank him
for saving your life.

33:47.126 --> 33:48.392
And what of his other mission?

33:48.394 --> 33:50.327
Did Mary truly
fall for him?

33:50.329 --> 33:52.162
I believe so, yes.

33:52.164 --> 33:56.099
Then tell me,
what would hurt more--

33:56.101 --> 33:58.268
knowing the person
you love will die,

33:58.270 --> 34:02.372
or knowing they are alive,
but you cannot have them?

34:02.374 --> 34:04.775
Knowing they're alive.

34:06.412 --> 34:09.813
But you can not have them.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.381
I don't care
if the queen of England

34:11.383 --> 34:12.649
agreed to a prisoner exchange.

34:12.651 --> 34:13.817
Gideon Blackburn
is an enemy of the Church,

34:13.819 --> 34:15.352
and he must be punished.

34:15.354 --> 34:17.821
Have you been to England,
Archbishop Ridolfi?

34:17.823 --> 34:19.723
Everything's damp,
the food's wretched.

34:19.725 --> 34:22.726
Trust me when I say,
he will be in his own hell.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.261
I don't think you appreciate

34:24.263 --> 34:25.662
how upset the Vatican is
over this.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.697
This monarchy
is under attack

34:27.699 --> 34:30.100
by a group, who I suspect

34:30.102 --> 34:31.668
turned one of your own,
Cardinal Morel.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.270
So you can understand,

34:33.272 --> 34:35.605
why I took the opportunity

34:35.607 --> 34:38.608
to get one of my most
loyal generals back to France--

34:38.610 --> 34:41.745
a Catholic country,
that you and I and Pope Pius

34:41.747 --> 34:44.548
all care for greatly.

34:44.550 --> 34:45.782
Did King Charles approve this?

34:45.784 --> 34:47.451
Of course.

34:47.453 --> 34:50.087
As well as the privy council?

34:50.089 --> 34:51.588
Are you asking me
if I got permission

34:51.590 --> 34:54.357
from the men of this country
to make a political move?

34:54.359 --> 34:56.560
That would be
the prudent thing to do.

34:56.562 --> 34:58.161
Why do you dismiss me?

34:58.163 --> 35:00.397
Because I'm a woman?

35:00.399 --> 35:01.798
I have a mind of my own.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.334
One that leads me
to wonder about things,

35:04.336 --> 35:06.436
like your true intentions
for Mary, Queen of Scots.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.773
If you were just using her
as a puppet.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.174
I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:11.176 --> 35:12.526
I find it hard to believe

35:12.527 --> 35:13.877
that Joseph Tudor acted alone.

35:13.879 --> 35:18.248
Makes perfect sense that you
wanted Elizabeth unseated,

35:18.250 --> 35:21.218
and that it would be easy
to dupe that poor fool, Mary,

35:21.220 --> 35:24.421
into thinking the Vatican truly
wanted her to rule England.

35:24.423 --> 35:26.556
Poor fool?

35:26.558 --> 35:28.391
You've always spoken
quite highly of her.

35:28.393 --> 35:29.826
She lost her husband
and her country.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.695
Her guard was down,
and you took advantage of it.

35:31.697 --> 35:32.829
From where I sit,

35:32.831 --> 35:34.698
which is on the French throne

35:34.700 --> 35:36.233
as its regent,

35:36.235 --> 35:38.735
I see the Vatican
pushing around female monarchs,

35:38.737 --> 35:41.138
and I don't
appreciate it one bit.

35:42.441 --> 35:43.573
You can go now.

35:45.210 --> 35:48.778
NARCISSE:
It is a great pleasure.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.180
It was the least I could do.

35:50.182 --> 35:51.681
Lord Narcisse.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.783
A word.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.219
Excuse me.

35:56.221 --> 35:58.155
To what do I owe
this pleasure?

35:58.157 --> 36:00.724
Do you have
more false accusations

36:00.726 --> 36:02.359
of treason to hurl my way?

36:02.361 --> 36:04.794
On the contrary,
I have come to realize that you

36:04.796 --> 36:08.698
were not behind the accusation
that I poisoned Francis,

36:08.700 --> 36:11.368
or behind the recent appearance
of the Red Knights.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.904
What changed your mind?

36:13.906 --> 36:15.672
We captured one of
the Red Knights' conspirators.

36:15.674 --> 36:16.806
He confessed

36:16.808 --> 36:17.941
to a plot

36:17.943 --> 36:20.210
to dismantle the monarchy.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.878
Stephan, your skills
of treachery

36:21.880 --> 36:23.313
are great,

36:23.315 --> 36:25.282
but your love of country
is greater.

36:25.284 --> 36:28.552
You would never have betrayed
France in that way.

36:28.554 --> 36:30.187
And people like you--

36:30.189 --> 36:33.490
people who will protect
this country at any cost--

36:33.492 --> 36:35.525
those are the people
that I need around me now.

36:38.197 --> 36:40.497
Do I hear the sound
of an apology?

36:40.499 --> 36:42.365
You hear the sound
of me asking for your help.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.900
To join me

36:43.902 --> 36:46.236
in the fight
against the Red Knights.

36:46.238 --> 36:49.539
Then my help you shall receive.

36:52.211 --> 36:55.378
(owls hooting, insects chirping)

36:56.481 --> 36:58.448
Oh.

36:59.484 --> 37:01.351
(sighs)

37:02.454 --> 37:03.887
Is it done?

37:03.889 --> 37:06.389
Our prisoner's corpse
has been hidden,

37:06.391 --> 37:08.491
even from God's sight.

37:08.493 --> 37:10.627
I was keen to see
if the Spirits of Salts

37:10.629 --> 37:12.229
could dissolve a whole body.

37:12.231 --> 37:13.663
It can.

37:13.665 --> 37:16.266
(sighs)

37:16.268 --> 37:17.968
The Red Knights
will strike again,

37:17.970 --> 37:21.972
so I will continue to require
your particular... skills.

37:21.974 --> 37:24.741
When he threw himself
at my blade

37:24.743 --> 37:25.942
and it pierced his chest,

37:25.944 --> 37:28.445
hot blood spilling
onto my hands...

37:28.447 --> 37:30.313
You couldn't have pulled
the knife back?

37:30.315 --> 37:32.649
I needed information from him.

37:32.651 --> 37:33.750
What can I say?

37:33.752 --> 37:35.585
He caught me off guard,

37:35.587 --> 37:37.254
and my instinct was

37:37.256 --> 37:39.356
to drive the knife
into him forever.

37:39.358 --> 37:42.525
The instincts of a killer.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.361
I couldn't help
but notice that

37:44.363 --> 37:46.529
when you were
torturing that man,

37:46.531 --> 37:47.964
it triggered quite...

37:47.966 --> 37:49.866
a reaction.

37:49.868 --> 37:53.303
That I was able to share
such an intimate moment...

37:53.305 --> 37:57.340
to have you by my side as I held
a man's life in my hands...

37:57.342 --> 38:00.944
It was exciting, wasn't it?

38:00.946 --> 38:02.946
We are no longer lovers,
Christophe.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.781
Just two people
who keep each other's secrets.

38:06.285 --> 38:08.585
So many people want
to cause you harm.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.320
All I want is to protect you.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.557
So tonight, and every night,

38:14.559 --> 38:15.992
I will sleep
at the foot of your bed.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.527
Christophe,

38:17.529 --> 38:19.029
you can't be serious?

38:24.536 --> 38:26.703
(sighs)

38:35.580 --> 38:37.080
Please, stop that.

38:37.082 --> 38:39.015
Hmm-mm.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.317
Are you... ?

38:40.319 --> 38:43.620
Yes, you are sucking my toes.

38:51.063 --> 38:53.363
(gasps)

38:55.334 --> 38:58.101
We make a brilliant team,
don't we?

38:58.103 --> 39:00.804
Yes, I would say we do.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.639
Not just that.

39:02.641 --> 39:05.975
Although, that was
rather brilliant.

39:05.977 --> 39:07.644
The other day,

39:07.646 --> 39:09.045
working together to expose

39:09.047 --> 39:10.814
Greer's brother-in-law.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.115
I enjoyed that.

39:12.117 --> 39:13.683
As did I.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.353
Up until the point
where I had to tell Greer

39:16.355 --> 39:18.388
her brother-in-law
was swindling her.

39:18.390 --> 39:20.657
What if...

39:22.661 --> 39:25.395
Well, I know you want
to raise your station

39:25.397 --> 39:26.496
so that we can be together.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.398
What if I helped you?

39:29.568 --> 39:32.102
Claude, I can't take your money.

39:32.104 --> 39:34.104
Especially as I don't
really have any.

39:34.106 --> 39:36.005
To get any, you have
to ask the realm.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.141
It's all very formal
and accounted for.

39:38.143 --> 39:40.410
I have jewels
and the like.

39:40.412 --> 39:43.113
Claude, really,
it's-it's all right.

39:43.115 --> 39:44.881
But I know people.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.417
My title opens doors, Leith.

39:47.419 --> 39:49.119
And that's what you
really need, isn't it?

39:49.121 --> 39:52.956
So you would provide
the contacts,

39:52.958 --> 39:54.524
and I would do the work.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.726
Yes.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.528
And you must work very hard,

39:58.530 --> 39:59.763
because I want
to be with you

39:59.765 --> 40:01.464
very much.

40:03.402 --> 40:04.601
All right.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.403
Really?

40:06.405 --> 40:07.904
Yes.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.707
That's marvelous.

40:10.709 --> 40:13.476
Oh, the adventures
we'll have.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.714
Be sure to watch out
for sea creatures

40:17.716 --> 40:19.048
when you're crossing
the channel.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.617
My father says
if I see a dolphin,

40:20.619 --> 40:21.885
it means we'll have good luck.

40:21.887 --> 40:24.154
(chuckles)

40:24.156 --> 40:25.889
I'll miss you, Agatha.

40:27.058 --> 40:29.726
I'll miss you, too.

40:29.728 --> 40:34.998
¶ As daydreams... ¶

40:35.000 --> 40:36.466
I'll see you at the carriage.

40:36.468 --> 40:40.603
¶ The color from shadows... ¶

40:40.605 --> 40:43.440
Thank you for convincing
Catherine to spare me.

40:43.442 --> 40:45.742
It's the least I could do,
after all you've done for me.

40:45.744 --> 40:50.079
But now I must continue
my service to England.

40:50.081 --> 40:51.948
And you will
take back your country.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.517
It's unlikely our paths
will cross again.

40:54.519 --> 40:56.152
But I will hope
that they do, that one day

40:56.154 --> 40:58.521
I will be
walking through Scottish court,

40:58.523 --> 41:01.191
turn a corner and meet

41:01.193 --> 41:03.193
my new English ambassador.

41:03.195 --> 41:05.228
I don't give my heart,

41:05.230 --> 41:06.229
or give up easily,

41:06.231 --> 41:07.931
either.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.232
You will see me again.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.234
¶ Dreams you should be keeping ¶

41:11.236 --> 41:14.103
¶ Pure and simple every time ¶

41:17.943 --> 41:19.876
¶ Look at me with starry eyes ¶

41:19.878 --> 41:22.679
¶ Push me up to starry skies ¶

41:22.681 --> 41:23.847
¶ There's stardust in my head ¶

41:23.849 --> 41:26.182
¶ Pure and simple over you. ¶
