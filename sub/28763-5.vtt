01:52.447 --> 01:53.573
I pushed him.

01:53.656 --> 01:56.951
Listen to me! Listen to me! I pushed him.

01:58.870 --> 02:00.747
Nobody did this.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.874
Nobody.

02:02.957 --> 02:05.293
Help! Somebody help me!

02:07.837 --> 02:08.836
Fuck.

02:45.625 --> 02:47.126
Hey, Ed. Ed.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.962
Hold on, man. Hey.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.841
Hey. Listen, man.

02:54.217 --> 02:57.887
I'm sorry for the whole party thing.

02:57.971 --> 02:59.305
Yeah, I overreacted.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.725
You know what? I don't believe you.

03:02.809 --> 03:04.477
- What?
- That you're sorry.

03:06.104 --> 03:10.733
- Why do you have to be such a fuck?
- Well, I don't have to be. I choose to be.

03:10.817 --> 03:13.152
See, not everybody gets along, Nathan.

03:13.236 --> 03:17.115
I mean, can't we just be comfortable
not liking each other?

03:17.198 --> 03:18.449
Doesn't have to be a reason.

03:23.788 --> 03:26.165
This whole fucking world's lost its mind.

03:26.249 --> 03:30.879
This whole fucking planet
is inhabited by nutfucks!

03:30.962 --> 03:32.130
Hey, nutfuck!

03:39.888 --> 03:43.808
Basically, this is child custody.
We will set a hearing.

03:43.892 --> 03:46.519
I will appoint a psychiatric investigator.

03:46.603 --> 03:51.065
He or she will interview the parties,
the children, your associates, your friends,

03:51.149 --> 03:53.568
anybody and everybody
he or she deems necessary

03:53.651 --> 03:56.195
to making a recommendation
to the court.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.615
In the end, it will come down
to my judgment

03:58.698 --> 04:02.619
whether there's been behavior
detrimental to the children.

04:02.702 --> 04:05.580
- Any questions so far?
- May I be heard, Your Honor?

04:05.663 --> 04:06.789
Very well.

04:06.873 --> 04:10.960
I do not consider Celeste Wright
to be a bad person.

04:11.044 --> 04:13.087
- Good to know.
- A wonderful mother.

04:13.171 --> 04:15.924
- Mary Louise.
- And I don't have any reason to doubt

04:16.007 --> 04:18.551
- her ongoing commitment to them.
- Okay.

04:18.635 --> 04:22.639
- So, what are we doing here?
- That said, she's not well.

04:22.722 --> 04:24.265
- All right.
- It's true.

04:24.349 --> 04:27.393
- This isn't the time, Mrs. Wright.
- Well, that you understand.

04:27.477 --> 04:30.813
This is not a case of angry mother-in-law
on the loose or something.

04:30.897 --> 04:33.524
- So unfair.
- Rather, it's as you suggest,

04:33.608 --> 04:36.611
we have to do
what is best for the children.

04:36.694 --> 04:39.781
We will take this up at another time.
This is inappropriate.

04:39.864 --> 04:41.157
- Yeah, we're good.
- Thank you.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.911
Thank you very much. Thank you.
We will see you at the hearing.

04:44.994 --> 04:47.622
- How do we not respond to that?
- Because we don't.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.707
- You're a lawyer.
- But we should have.

04:49.791 --> 04:53.461
She gets to make a sympathetic first
impression, and what, I just sit there silent?

04:53.544 --> 04:57.674
Which, in the face of an accusation, can be
deemed an admission of fucking guilt.

04:57.757 --> 04:59.884
The judge won't see it that way.

04:59.968 --> 05:02.762
She's after my kids.

05:03.846 --> 05:07.558
That's exactly the type of flare-up
they'll be looking to provoke. Okay?

05:07.642 --> 05:08.643
God.

05:09.894 --> 05:12.939
She gets to make an opening statement,
and you did nothing.

05:13.022 --> 05:15.274
I didn't hire you to do nothing.

05:15.358 --> 05:16.567
Please.

05:17.610 --> 05:21.406
Because nothing
was exactly the right response, Celeste.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.700
We have a very smart judge in there.

05:23.783 --> 05:26.786
One who will be able to see through
your mother-in-law's performance

05:26.869 --> 05:30.123
and see it for what it was.
Just a performance.

05:30.206 --> 05:34.669
I told you, I am not about putting up that
kind of performance. I'm about credibility.

05:36.004 --> 05:38.840
So when I speak, judges listen.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.593
- And now I need you to listen.
- Okay.

05:42.677 --> 05:47.015
They don't win here
unless they establish you as unhinged.

05:47.098 --> 05:50.476
So you should expect everything
and anything they do say

05:50.560 --> 05:53.855
to be precisely designed
to get you to react.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.983
We will not give them that.

06:23.885 --> 06:24.885
Mom.

06:28.806 --> 06:31.142
Hi.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.894
- What a nice surprise.
- Hi.

06:34.771 --> 06:37.565
- Where's Dad?
- Outside with Grandpa.

06:41.527 --> 06:43.279
Is she getting better?

06:43.362 --> 06:44.822
A little.

06:44.906 --> 06:46.532
Still can't talk, though.

06:48.826 --> 06:50.953
- Today's gym, right?
- Mm-hm.

06:51.204 --> 06:53.039
- Got all your stuff?
- Yep.

06:54.123 --> 06:55.875
Oh, I miss you.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.420
There's a surprise for you at home.

06:59.504 --> 07:01.255
- Shh. Hey. What?
- Oh, yeah?

07:02.423 --> 07:05.718
- Okay.
- All right. Time to go, big girl.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.430
- Pit stop's over.
- Okay.

07:15.937 --> 07:16.979
Bye, Grandma.

07:19.023 --> 07:22.568
Love you, baby.
Thanks for stopping by.

07:22.652 --> 07:25.446
Bye. I love you. Bye, Grandpa.

07:25.530 --> 07:26.530
Bye.

07:44.841 --> 07:47.510
The most important thing is
that you remain open-minded.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.720
You know, really, open to new theories...

07:49.804 --> 07:52.181
This isn't gonna be like
wife-swapping, is it?

07:52.265 --> 07:55.601
No. This is a healing institute.

07:55.685 --> 07:58.563
Not a swingers' convention.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.731
Please have an open mind. Please?

08:00.815 --> 08:02.233
I'm in the car.

08:02.316 --> 08:05.027
We're warriors, you and me. You know?

08:09.991 --> 08:12.034

08:27.592 --> 08:28.592
Really?

08:30.303 --> 08:33.639
I couldn't believe it.
I sat there and I didn't say anything.

08:33.722 --> 08:37.058
Katie seems to think that's the right thing
to do, I'm not thinking straight.

08:37.143 --> 08:38.644
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm just not.

08:38.727 --> 08:42.690
This is disgusting. I mean, honestly,
I wanna sit down with Mary Louise.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.318
Well, I don't think that that would help.

08:45.401 --> 08:47.069
I don't know, Celeste.

08:47.153 --> 08:53.117
Listen, don't get me wrong,
but, um, you're an attorney yourself,

08:53.201 --> 08:56.537
and we gotta just say it:
lawyers fuck things up often.

08:56.621 --> 09:00.166
And that's why
I wanted to ask you about Katie.

09:00.249 --> 09:03.085
- Well, what about her?
- Well, I mean, is she...

09:04.295 --> 09:08.007
- Is she as good as people say?
- She's good because of this.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.718
It's a very different kind of skill set,

09:10.801 --> 09:13.804
and judges in family court
don't like bulldogs.

09:13.888 --> 09:16.432
And so I think given that, she's good.

09:16.515 --> 09:19.644
I mean, I think the straightest line
to get this resolved

09:19.727 --> 09:24.732
- is just to have Mary Louise call it off. Mm...
- No. She's not gonna do that. She's not.

09:24.815 --> 09:25.858
She might.

09:25.942 --> 09:27.860
I need to take a crack at her.

09:27.944 --> 09:29.612
- Okay? This is what I do.
- Renata.

09:29.695 --> 09:32.740
- Yeah? We're in a meeting.
- Renata. I'm so sorry.

09:32.823 --> 09:36.827
I just got a call from Suzie Jenkins,
<i>San Francisco Magazine,</i>

09:36.911 --> 09:39.455
and please don't shoot the messenger.

09:39.538 --> 09:45.670
They are not going to include you
in the "Women in Power" piece.

09:48.631 --> 09:49.882
I'm sorry?

09:51.050 --> 09:53.261
- Did she say why?
- Um...

09:54.762 --> 09:57.056
The bankruptcy thing.

09:57.139 --> 10:00.059
- Listen, I can step out.
- No, no, my God, no. No.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.394
No. Stay right there.

10:01.477 --> 10:04.146
They said it's not the story
that they're telling.

10:04.230 --> 10:07.733
She just said the focus is women on top.

10:11.362 --> 10:14.115
- I'm so sorry. I...
- No, I mean, my God, it's not your fault.

10:14.198 --> 10:16.909
- I know, I just feel terrible...
- I said it's not your fault!

10:18.160 --> 10:19.328
Can you excuse us?

10:19.412 --> 10:21.622
I can make you some
Africa Zimbabwe tea.

10:21.706 --> 10:23.082
If you just stop talking.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.584
Okay, I'm gonna go away.

10:25.668 --> 10:26.836
That would be best.

10:28.379 --> 10:29.964
Are you okay?

10:30.047 --> 10:32.466
I am not okay, Celeste.

10:32.550 --> 10:34.802
Well, I mean, it's just a magazine article.

10:34.885 --> 10:38.014
It's not just a magazine.
It's Women in Power!

10:38.097 --> 10:40.266
I mean, we're supposed to be
on each other's side,

10:40.349 --> 10:42.268
and they're backstabbing sluts.

10:49.734 --> 10:52.320
"Ziggy." That's a dumb ass name.

10:52.403 --> 10:54.363
My brother knows about you.

10:54.447 --> 10:56.449
He said you have a hot mom.
Is that true?

10:58.367 --> 11:00.411
You know you're a mistake, right?

11:02.580 --> 11:04.290
Come on, pussy boy.

11:04.373 --> 11:05.373
Say something.

11:10.171 --> 11:11.547
What's going on?

11:11.630 --> 11:13.049
Beat it. I'm talking to someone.

11:13.132 --> 11:14.717
Leave my brother alone.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.428
He's your brother?
That means your dad's a rapist.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.681
- Get the hell out of here!
- Make me.

11:36.572 --> 11:38.324
His name is Brian McPherson.

11:38.407 --> 11:41.994
He is a bit difficult,
and he has bullied others.

11:42.078 --> 11:45.623
But he's the one sitting in the hospital
getting his lip stitched up.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.706
Oh, my God.

11:48.042 --> 11:50.378
- I'm suspending all four boys.
- What?

11:50.461 --> 11:53.130
It's just three days.
While we investigate...

11:53.214 --> 11:54.965
Investigate? Why didn't you do that first?

11:55.049 --> 11:57.134
It was three against one.
The boy got hurt.

11:57.218 --> 11:58.761
My hands are tied.

12:10.231 --> 12:12.191
You need to tell me
what he said to you.

12:12.274 --> 12:15.027
Hey. Uh-uh. Look at me.

12:15.111 --> 12:16.320
What did he say?

12:16.404 --> 12:18.697
- I told you. I can't remember.
- Ziggy.

12:22.701 --> 12:25.287
He said my father's a rapist.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.364
Answer me!

13:40.779 --> 13:42.281
I'll take over.

13:44.950 --> 13:45.993
Okay.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.372
- I'll see you later.
- See you.

13:53.751 --> 13:55.753
Be open-minded, okay?

13:55.836 --> 13:58.172
- Look at the view.
- It is pretty.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.299
And they have a fireplace.

14:00.382 --> 14:03.135
So you're gonna wander the space.
We're not moving in a circle.

14:03.219 --> 14:04.762
We're exploring the space,

14:04.845 --> 14:07.848
and when you come face-to-face
with someone you'd like to hug,

14:07.932 --> 14:13.437
give them a hug for about the length
of a nice inhale, exhale. Okay?

14:15.147 --> 14:16.147
Good.

14:24.365 --> 14:25.365
Thank you.

14:28.577 --> 14:29.577
Thank you.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.499
Oh, my God.

14:33.582 --> 14:37.127
That was awful. I'm so sorry.

14:37.211 --> 14:40.506
Thank you for at least agreeing to try.

14:42.883 --> 14:46.136
You're a really good man.
Good husband, good father.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.183
I was a sound choice.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.186
What are you saying?

14:55.271 --> 14:58.691
- What? What are you trying to say?
- I've said it many times, Madeline.

14:58.774 --> 15:02.194
Saying it one more time
is not gonna kill you, is it?

15:02.278 --> 15:07.032
Nathan broke your world,
which at its core is family.

15:07.116 --> 15:10.160
- You've said it many times.
- I know. I've said it many, many times.

15:10.244 --> 15:14.707
- Is it a fucking crime?
- I didn't say it was a fucking crime.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.875
Okay, then,
what are you trying to say to me?

15:16.959 --> 15:19.795
Please just tell me. I have no idea.

15:19.878 --> 15:23.591
On our first dates,
it was like you were interviewing me.

15:25.551 --> 15:30.306
Not so much for the soulmate position
or lover.

15:31.724 --> 15:33.642
But rather, father.

15:33.726 --> 15:35.519
The stable provider.

15:37.062 --> 15:41.775
Abigail was ripped apart
and you were determined to fix that.

15:41.859 --> 15:46.155
To not make the mistake
of going down the lust path again.

15:46.238 --> 15:51.035
You had a certain criteria,
and I checked all the boxes.

15:51.118 --> 15:55.456
So you made the sound, practical choice.

15:56.874 --> 15:59.418
It's not something
I couldn't make peace with. I did.

16:00.878 --> 16:04.381
But then you got unsound.

16:04.465 --> 16:10.888
You decided to make impractical choices,
one being to fuck Joseph Bachman,

16:10.971 --> 16:14.099
which left me
with the most difficult choice of all:

16:14.183 --> 16:20.147
to walk out with my dignity or to stay
with a woman who I simply cannot trust.

16:31.784 --> 16:33.577
You can trust me to love you.

16:35.871 --> 16:38.332
More deeply
than I've ever loved anybody.

16:40.542 --> 16:43.921
Can you trust me
not to fuck things up again?

16:44.004 --> 16:45.004
Maybe not.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.967
I don't know
if I can trust myself with that.

16:50.386 --> 16:52.471
I didn't trust my parents' marriage,

16:52.554 --> 16:57.101
and the one I had with Nathan
was not to be believed.

16:58.977 --> 17:02.106
And I don't know what it is, I don't...

17:02.189 --> 17:05.233
Maybe it's some unconscious,
preemptive thing

17:05.317 --> 17:08.362
where I wanna be the destroyer,
not the destroyee.

17:09.570 --> 17:13.282
I don't understand,
and I racked my brain about it, but I...

17:16.578 --> 17:19.623
Because all I really want
is to be married to you.

17:22.710 --> 17:24.336
Just happily married to you.

17:26.255 --> 17:30.217
But I must have low self-esteem
or I fucking hate myself or something

17:30.300 --> 17:31.927
because look what I've done.

17:34.430 --> 17:37.808
If I fuck up again,
it will not be with infidelity.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.184
I give you my word.

17:40.728 --> 17:43.647
All my future mistakes
will be brand-new ones.

17:53.031 --> 17:59.580
They said it was ultimately a smear on
the entire publication if I was in this article.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.668
I'm sorry. That sucks.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.799
You know,
it might actually be for the best.

18:10.883 --> 18:11.925
What?

18:12.009 --> 18:15.679
I... The article would have put a target
right on your back.

18:15.763 --> 18:18.974
I've spent my entire life
with a bull's-eye on my back.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.517
This is one I wanted.

18:22.561 --> 18:23.561
That's for me.

18:24.646 --> 18:25.898
Coming!

18:25.981 --> 18:28.025
- Oh, Mary Louise.
- Hello.

18:29.401 --> 18:32.237
- Hi. Thank you so much for coming.
- Thank you.

18:32.321 --> 18:35.949
Pleasure's mine.
I don't often get invited for tea in this neck.

18:36.033 --> 18:39.495
Well, please. Please. Um...

18:39.578 --> 18:42.331
What kind of tea would you like?

18:42.414 --> 18:47.211
Again, I just... I wanna say I really
appreciate you coming because, um...

18:47.294 --> 18:52.466
I know there's a lot going on,
and, uh, it must be so unbearably difficult.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.676
It is. Thank you for...

18:56.386 --> 18:58.013
For understanding that.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.223
Of course. My God.

18:59.306 --> 19:02.434
And listen, just between you and me,
I did want us...

19:02.518 --> 19:07.356
I was hoping
this would just be about tea.

19:07.439 --> 19:11.151
But people don't do that anymore.
Do they?

19:13.070 --> 19:14.238
Uh...

19:14.321 --> 19:15.321
Do what?

19:15.364 --> 19:17.866
Just enjoy each other's company.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.743
Just no agenda.

19:19.827 --> 19:24.414
It would be so nice
if people could just be together, you know.

19:24.498 --> 19:28.252
But maybe somebody will invent an app
for that.

19:28.335 --> 19:31.880
Well, um, can I...

19:34.216 --> 19:35.092
talk to you?

19:35.175 --> 19:37.386
Just mother to mother.

19:37.469 --> 19:38.846
I would like that.

19:38.929 --> 19:41.598
Great. And thinking about
everything that's going on...

19:41.682 --> 19:43.225
What happened to your furniture?

19:43.308 --> 19:47.354
I mean, it's such a big house, you would
think there would be a lot of furniture.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.649
Well, we're going through
a little bankruptcy thing right now,

19:50.732 --> 19:51.900
which is almost resolved.

19:51.984 --> 19:54.444
- But, um...
- Oh, that sounds awful.

19:54.528 --> 19:56.864
- Well...
- But you work, don't you, Renata?

19:56.947 --> 19:58.907
- I do. Yes.
- Yeah.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.829
That must be especially devastating
for a working mom

20:03.912 --> 20:05.914
to lose her house, her belongings,

20:05.998 --> 20:11.670
because just to think about the sacrifice...
You know, all the missed dinners with kids,

20:11.753 --> 20:15.591
and the not being able to host
the after-school play dates,

20:15.674 --> 20:19.511
there's just so many,
many moments lost.

20:19.595 --> 20:22.639
And for what? A screening room.

20:23.891 --> 20:25.017
Maybe a boat.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.477
Sorry.

20:30.147 --> 20:32.482
You were saying... Oh. Mother to mother?

20:32.566 --> 20:35.485
Are you placing judgment
on my life choices?

20:35.569 --> 20:37.946
I don't know your life choices.

20:38.030 --> 20:41.033
I don't know you,
other than you're a friend of Celeste,

20:41.116 --> 20:47.247
and you seem like a very nice person
who lives in a big house with no furniture.

20:51.835 --> 20:55.714
This is a serious situation and the boy
needed stitches, so I need to know.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.549
Who instigated the fight?

20:57.633 --> 20:59.551
Was it you, Max?

20:59.635 --> 21:01.970
- Was it?
- He was saying stuff about Dad.

21:02.054 --> 21:04.473
And he was picking on Ziggy.

21:04.556 --> 21:05.556
So, what?

21:06.516 --> 21:09.853
So the three of you attacked him?
You ganged up on him?

21:09.937 --> 21:13.190
You can't do that.
Violence is not the answer.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.859
Look at me. You think it is?

21:21.448 --> 21:23.992
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?

21:24.076 --> 21:25.619
Stop being such a bitch.

21:25.702 --> 21:28.372
Don't talk to me like that!

21:28.455 --> 21:30.791
You do not talk to me like that!

21:33.418 --> 21:36.421
Come here. Stop it.
You can't talk to your mother like that.

21:36.505 --> 21:38.423
You can't talk to me like that.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.468
Do you understand me?

21:43.261 --> 21:44.388
It's not right.

22:02.114 --> 22:06.326
I have an appointment tonight.
Kelly's gonna be here in a minute to sit.

22:06.410 --> 22:07.703
What kind of appointment?

22:10.247 --> 22:11.790
Oh, um...

22:15.168 --> 22:16.461
With a lawyer.

22:20.757 --> 22:25.012
Your grandmother thinks it would be better
if you lived with her for a little while,

22:25.095 --> 22:28.223
and I disagree, and it's...

22:29.391 --> 22:30.517
Why does she think that?

22:31.935 --> 22:34.771
Because I... I don't know.

22:34.855 --> 22:38.859
- We're not gonna live here anymore?
- No, you're gonna live here.

22:38.942 --> 22:43.113
We have to have a judge decide,
and that's what I have to go and do tonight.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.741
I don't wanna live with Grandma.

22:45.824 --> 22:48.785
I don't want you to live with Grandma
and you're not going to.

22:48.869 --> 22:50.495
You will be living here.

22:53.290 --> 22:57.878
All right?
You will absolutely be living here.

23:06.428 --> 23:10.057

23:16.104 --> 23:17.104

You okay? All right.

23:45.842 --> 23:46.927
All right.

23:48.053 --> 23:49.053
Yummy.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.935
Sink into the floor.

23:57.395 --> 24:01.441

Is Mom okay?

24:23.630 --> 24:25.215
What the hell is that?

24:26.633 --> 24:28.385
Singing for sleep apnea.

24:29.427 --> 24:31.429
Stanford Sleep Clinic.
They diagnose everyone.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.140
The class is a cash cow. What's up?

24:35.100 --> 24:36.100
Well, um...

24:37.602 --> 24:39.271
Not your mother.

24:39.354 --> 24:41.481
I think we need to get her out
of this hospital.

24:41.565 --> 24:43.316
Aren't they moving her to rehab?

24:43.400 --> 24:45.402
Which means
they're throwing their hands up.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.405
- They don't think she'll get better?
- We need to do something.

24:49.698 --> 24:51.783
Look at you, getting involved.

24:51.867 --> 24:52.867
Wow.

24:54.327 --> 24:55.327
I gotta go.

24:56.913 --> 25:00.208
- Dad.
- You don't think I got involved?

25:01.418 --> 25:03.503
That I didn't protect you?

25:03.587 --> 25:06.673
- No, Dad, I don't.
- If you only goddamn knew.

25:06.756 --> 25:09.551
I do goddamn know. I was there.

25:11.052 --> 25:12.846
Did you diffuse things? Sure.

25:12.929 --> 25:17.309
Did you stop shit from getting worse?
Sometimes. But did you protect me?

25:22.606 --> 25:28.069
<i>♪ We've come too far to
leave it all behind ♪</i>

25:28.820 --> 25:31.656
Well, thank you for agreeing to meet.

25:32.741 --> 25:33.992
I'll get right to the point.

25:35.660 --> 25:38.872
There are only losers
in procedures like these,

25:38.955 --> 25:42.918
and the biggest ones, invariably,
being the children.

25:43.001 --> 25:47.422
So my suggestion is that we agree
to joint custody, one where...

25:47.505 --> 25:50.008
- No. No. No.
- Just hear me out, please. Hear me out.

25:50.091 --> 25:52.844
One where weekdays with you...

25:52.928 --> 25:55.555
- Are you kidding me? No.
- Hear me out. No, just hear me out.

25:55.639 --> 25:59.768
Weekdays with you. Weekends
with my client, Saturdays and Sundays.

25:59.851 --> 26:01.353
- What?
- You would seek treatment

26:01.436 --> 26:04.648
for drug and alcohol dependency,
as well as anger management.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.775
- Once you... Well, there you go.
- Fuck you.

26:06.858 --> 26:09.569
Now, these things will come up,
Mrs. Wright.

26:09.653 --> 26:10.946
Is that a threat?

26:11.029 --> 26:12.072
That's a fact.

26:14.366 --> 26:17.160
You... You're not getting my boys.

26:17.244 --> 26:21.373
Not for a Saturday, not for a Sunday,
not for a fucking minute.

26:21.456 --> 26:23.667
Did you really expect me to accept this?

26:25.335 --> 26:26.920
How are the boys doing?

26:28.088 --> 26:30.006
You know,
we don't want this to go to court.

26:33.009 --> 26:34.928
There will be no joint custody.

26:36.012 --> 26:39.140
I see silence continues
to be your weapon of choice.

26:39.224 --> 26:43.103
- Exactly what am I paying you for?
- It was actually a decent offer.

26:43.186 --> 26:45.313
- No.
- There are so many possibilities

26:45.397 --> 26:47.274
should this go to court, Celeste.

26:47.357 --> 26:48.942
A lot of them bad.

26:51.903 --> 26:54.239
- You said we should win.
- We should.

26:54.322 --> 26:58.118
But we could also lose.
The offer we just got is a win in my opinion.

26:58.201 --> 26:59.828
Oh, God.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.455
There's also...

27:03.999 --> 27:04.999
What?

27:06.668 --> 27:08.795
- What?
- Your husband's death.

27:10.755 --> 27:11.756
It will come up.

27:18.138 --> 27:19.138
Shit.

27:25.353 --> 27:27.439
There's gonna be a guardianship hearing.

27:27.522 --> 27:32.610
I'm gonna have to testify, and that means
that I'm fair game on everything.

27:32.694 --> 27:35.655
- Fuck, you're right.
- And Katie is pretty much convinced

27:35.739 --> 27:38.616
- that Farber is getting help from the police.
- She is?

27:38.700 --> 27:40.869
- What?
- Christ.

27:40.952 --> 27:46.124
So, basically, he's an agent for them,
and I suppose they can ask me anything.

27:46.207 --> 27:47.334
- Under oath.
- Yeah.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.794
- Oh, my God.
- And if I get caught in, like, a lie

27:49.878 --> 27:51.796
or something, then they have a case.

27:51.880 --> 27:55.759
- Can you just plead the Fifth?
- No, I'll lose my kids, Madeline.

27:55.842 --> 27:56.842
That's true.

27:58.178 --> 28:02.015
And they have this witness list with you.
You were all on the list.

28:02.098 --> 28:04.642
But why would they call us?
We're on your side.

28:04.726 --> 28:07.604
Madeline, please.
It's a fucking perjury trap.

28:07.687 --> 28:11.900
That's what they would do. They'd call us
to the stand to testify to Celeste's fitness.

28:11.983 --> 28:14.652
- Yeah.
- Then under oath, they say, "Oh, by the way,

28:14.736 --> 28:16.863
- how did Perry Wright fall down the stairs?"
- No.

28:16.946 --> 28:17.989
- Yes.
- Can they do that?

28:18.073 --> 28:20.408
- Yes.
- Okay, but then we just stick with our story.

28:20.492 --> 28:22.077
That's perjury, babe.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.287
Okay, but they'd have to prove
we were lying.

28:24.371 --> 28:25.997
They probably can't.

28:26.081 --> 28:27.624
What if they can?

28:27.707 --> 28:30.960
I'm just telling you this
because we have to be prepared.

28:33.463 --> 28:35.465
Look, we have to stick together.

28:35.548 --> 28:38.176
That's the only way we've gotten this far.

28:38.259 --> 28:40.637
If we stick together, we'll be fine.

28:40.720 --> 28:41.971
We're gonna be fine.

28:50.063 --> 28:52.357
Thank you again.
He really likes you.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.483
You're welcome.

28:53.566 --> 28:55.402
Any time. He's a pleasure.

28:59.072 --> 29:00.365
Still up?

29:01.408 --> 29:04.536
And on your iPad, I see,
which you're not supposed to have at night.

29:04.619 --> 29:05.662
Can I please have that?

29:06.955 --> 29:07.955
Thank you.

29:13.169 --> 29:15.755
Listen, um,
me and you are gonna have breakfast

29:15.839 --> 29:18.883
with Max and Josh in the morning.
I have to work for a few hours,

29:18.967 --> 29:21.970
but I'm gonna get off early
and I'll meet you guys at Whaler's Cove,

29:22.053 --> 29:23.847
I don't know, sometime in the afternoon.

29:25.014 --> 29:29.018
And then you, me, Celeste, and the boys
are gonna go kayaking.

29:29.102 --> 29:32.397
- Cool.
- It's not a reward for bad behavior.

29:32.480 --> 29:36.734
I just figured since you're suspended,
I mean, we might as well get some exercise.

29:40.405 --> 29:42.782
You like Corey, right?

29:44.451 --> 29:45.451
Mm-hm.

29:45.493 --> 29:46.703
Yeah, I do.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.163
Me too.

29:48.246 --> 29:49.372
That's good.

29:51.124 --> 29:54.043
Am I gonna grow up to be like him?

29:54.127 --> 29:56.296
- Like Corey?
- No.

29:56.379 --> 29:57.922
Like my father.

29:59.132 --> 30:01.259
No. God, no, baby.

30:01.342 --> 30:08.099
And you are gonna grow up
to be the sweetest, kindest,

30:08.183 --> 30:13.980
most handsome, funniest, loveliest,

30:14.063 --> 30:17.525
adorablest man.

30:17.609 --> 30:18.776
I promise you that.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.028
Thanks, Mom.

30:22.071 --> 30:23.071
I love you.

30:47.597 --> 30:48.597
Baby?

30:51.100 --> 30:55.897
He's at the hospital, sitting vigilantly.
He wanted us to take a break.

30:57.232 --> 30:58.232
Sweet.

31:01.486 --> 31:02.987
I was protecting you.

31:05.865 --> 31:06.866
Or so I thought.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.953
Best way I could, by keeping the peace.

31:11.162 --> 31:12.539
It's okay, Dad.

31:12.622 --> 31:15.291
I know how weak I must seem to you.

31:17.460 --> 31:22.465
But I was just trying to do whatever I could
to make the rage go away. For you.

31:25.718 --> 31:26.718
And for me.

31:27.762 --> 31:29.681
- Okay.
- And for her.

31:40.692 --> 31:42.860
She started to talk this afternoon.

31:43.903 --> 31:44.903
To mumble.

31:48.741 --> 31:52.078
I had no idea what she was trying to say.
Uh...

31:52.161 --> 31:54.789
She tried and she tried,
and finally, I got it.

31:54.872 --> 31:55.915
What did she say?

31:57.584 --> 31:59.002
She said you're drowning.

32:01.963 --> 32:07.010
Sometimes the things she feels and sees
turn out to be right, and now I'm worried.

32:07.093 --> 32:08.093
Dad.

32:10.263 --> 32:13.349
- What's going on?
- I'm just gonna go check on Skye.

32:17.854 --> 32:19.606
Why is Grandma doing this?

32:24.611 --> 32:31.611
Because I think she's worried
that I'm still sad over missing your daddy,

32:31.701 --> 32:33.620
and she...

32:39.083 --> 32:46.083
She thinks that my sadness
isn't always good for you two.

32:47.425 --> 32:50.762
So she thinks it would be better
if you lived with her.

32:51.846 --> 32:54.766
For a while, while I get over my sadness.

32:56.684 --> 32:57.935
Do you think that?

33:00.563 --> 33:01.563
No.

33:02.315 --> 33:04.651
Mm-mm. I do not think that.

33:06.152 --> 33:10.114
So I don't know what kind of questions
this doctor is gonna ask,

33:10.198 --> 33:12.408
but if she asks you,

33:14.118 --> 33:16.454
who you would prefer to live with,

33:19.499 --> 33:23.127
then it's really important
that you say you wanna live here.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.881
Because she might tell the judge?

33:26.964 --> 33:27.840
Exactly.

33:27.924 --> 33:29.676
She might tell the judge.

33:32.261 --> 33:35.139
Well, shall we say we
don't like Grandma?

33:39.227 --> 33:40.895
No, don't say that.

33:46.025 --> 33:47.193
We can protect you.

33:48.903 --> 33:49.903
Yeah.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.616
We can say whatever you want us to say.

33:56.828 --> 33:57.912
Listen to me.

33:59.247 --> 34:02.333
You do not need to protect me.

34:03.835 --> 34:04.835
All right?

34:06.587 --> 34:12.009
You just have to tell the truth
that you wanna live here.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.386
Okay.

34:13.469 --> 34:14.469
Okay.

34:15.388 --> 34:16.388
I love you.

34:19.475 --> 34:21.018
Get good sleep.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.395
Big day tomorrow.

34:23.688 --> 34:24.688
Good night, Mom.

34:24.772 --> 34:26.607
- Good night.
- Good night.

34:30.945 --> 34:32.237
Hey, Sweet Pea.

34:33.447 --> 34:34.866
How come I'm not at school?

34:36.868 --> 34:38.870
Sweetie, I told you.

34:38.953 --> 34:43.541
Ziggy and Max and Josh are having
their special day with their moms,

34:43.623 --> 34:47.837
and I thought, "Well, wait a minute.
Let's us have a mother-daughter day."

34:47.920 --> 34:51.549
This is because we're broke, isn't it?
And we have to move.

34:51.632 --> 34:55.261
No, Amabella, it's because I wanted
to spend the day with you.

34:56.304 --> 34:58.931
Sweetie, everything isn't about money.

35:00.475 --> 35:03.186
Well, it is, but it isn't.

35:03.269 --> 35:06.606
What matters is this.

35:06.689 --> 35:09.108
Your family, your friends...

35:09.192 --> 35:15.281
Now, when you're ready,
I will race you to that pool, we will dive in,

35:15.364 --> 35:18.284
and we will have so much fun.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.244
- Okay?
- Okay.

35:20.328 --> 35:21.454
Don't worry.

35:28.836 --> 35:31.255
Do you and Ed have another plan?

35:31.339 --> 35:32.590
No, not yet.

35:32.673 --> 35:35.718
You know what I was thinking?
He loves to golf, so I'll learn to golf,

35:35.802 --> 35:39.222
- something we can do together.
- Why would you wanna golf? You hate golf.

35:39.305 --> 35:40.306
True.

35:40.389 --> 35:42.767
But I took a vow. For better or worse.

35:42.850 --> 35:46.103
- All right, all over your face.
- No, it's not. It's fine.

35:46.187 --> 35:48.189
- Mary Louise.
- Madeline.

35:48.272 --> 35:49.732
- Hi.
- Hello.

35:49.816 --> 35:52.276
This is my daughter, Abigail.
This is Mary Louise Wright.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.862
- Hi.
- You must be the one who's off to college.

35:55.446 --> 35:57.240
- Mm...
- Can I say something?

35:57.323 --> 35:58.241
Of course.

35:58.324 --> 36:01.244
What you're doing is indecent.

36:01.327 --> 36:03.538
Trying to take those boys away
from their mother.

36:03.621 --> 36:06.165
- Very nice to meet you, Abigail.
- What's wrong with you?

36:06.249 --> 36:07.583
Huh?

36:07.667 --> 36:08.960
Huh?

36:09.460 --> 36:10.503
She's psycho.

What, Mama?

38:38.818 --> 38:40.403
Kill me.

Oh, my God.

39:02.591 --> 39:04.135
