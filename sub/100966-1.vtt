00:00.633 --> 00:03.103
(upbeat music)

00:15.715 --> 00:18.385
(upbeat music)

00:29.262 --> 00:31.364
- [Linda] There's just something about the sunny blue sky

00:31.364 --> 00:34.067
in this town that makes them shine.

00:34.067 --> 00:37.070
The power, the draw, the expression.

00:38.438 --> 00:40.173
The enchantment of a woman's hands

00:40.173 --> 00:42.475
when they are well taken care of.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.811
It really is hard to resist

00:44.811 --> 00:49.616
the way nails feel when gently grazed against your skin.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.851
The way a perfectly primp set of toes

00:51.851 --> 00:54.654
looks in the right pair of heels.

00:54.654 --> 00:56.456
I've always loved it.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.260
I had a teacher in school who always tapped her nails

01:00.260 --> 01:03.496
on things when she was trying to make a point.

01:03.496 --> 01:06.433
I would watch her run her long acrylic french tips

01:06.433 --> 01:10.470
through her hair as she put it in a bun.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.806
Some might say I had a crush on her,

01:12.806 --> 01:17.177
but really I was completely entranced by her hands.

01:18.545 --> 01:21.147
It was as if she was conducting a symphony,

01:21.147 --> 01:23.716
and her fingers played the role of the baton.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.652
I would eagerly await the holidays,

01:25.652 --> 01:28.121
because she would switch to a deep red

01:28.121 --> 01:29.589
that looked like fresh blood,

01:29.589 --> 01:31.791
perfectly painted on her fingertips.

01:31.791 --> 01:36.796
No doubt, my passion for nail care began during that time.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.200
I knew the possibilities were endless then,

01:40.200 --> 01:44.204
and the nail world still never ceases to amaze me.

01:51.711 --> 01:53.213
- The phone ringing off the hook!

01:53.213 --> 01:54.781
When are we getting help?

01:54.781 --> 01:57.484
- Mimi, I have a new person starting today.

01:57.484 --> 01:59.486
- This bitch better not be shady like last bitch.

01:59.486 --> 02:00.620
(gentle music)

02:00.620 --> 02:02.255
- So, tell me about yourself.

02:02.255 --> 02:03.389
- Being completely honest with you,

02:03.389 --> 02:05.325
I absolutely hate that question,

02:05.325 --> 02:07.227
because I can honestly take it a million different ways.

02:07.227 --> 02:11.631
So let's just cut to the chase, I watch your space,

02:11.631 --> 02:13.466
and I have a lot of clients.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.901
So you don't have to worry about having to fill the books,

02:14.901 --> 02:16.236
or anything, 'cause I have my own clients,

02:16.236 --> 02:17.904
I'm gonna bring 'em all over.

02:17.904 --> 02:19.506
Now, I am really busy, so I'm only gonna need the chair

02:19.506 --> 02:21.174
about like maybe two days a week.

02:21.174 --> 02:23.643
Like maybe like a random Wednesday,

02:23.643 --> 02:25.278
and then like the last Sunday of the month,

02:25.278 --> 02:27.480
or something like that, I don't know.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.615
- Interesting.

02:28.615 --> 02:29.516
And what's your name again?

02:29.516 --> 02:30.550
- Oh, Annita.

02:30.550 --> 02:31.684
- Annita.

02:31.684 --> 02:33.419
- With two Ns.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.321
- We have a interesting group,

02:35.321 --> 02:38.658
and I actually think you'll fit right in.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.628
When do you wanna start?

02:42.762 --> 02:44.397
- Oh, yikes.

02:44.397 --> 02:45.865
Let's see, I have the restaurant,

02:45.865 --> 02:48.635
on Wednesday I have the water aerobics.

02:48.635 --> 02:50.370
How about, honestly?

02:51.738 --> 02:53.406
Screw it, let's just do tomorrow.

02:53.406 --> 02:54.841
Does tomorrow work? I could do tomorrow.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.809
- Okay, and you do know the rate?

02:57.877 --> 02:59.579
- Yeah, it's--

02:59.579 --> 03:00.713
- It's 200 a day.

03:00.713 --> 03:01.714
- Yeah, that's what I read.

03:01.714 --> 03:03.616
Yeah, that's fine.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.552
- I will probably need you to give me that in cash,

03:05.552 --> 03:06.419
is that okay?

03:06.419 --> 03:07.520
- Cash, yeah.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.856
- [Linda] In advance.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.624
Before you move in.

03:11.624 --> 03:12.792
- You got it.

03:12.792 --> 03:13.960
I got that.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.628
- Okay.

03:15.628 --> 03:16.963
Well, I think you will fit right in.

03:16.963 --> 03:17.964
Welcome.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.832
- Oh, thank you so much.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.935
- She stole our tip.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.469
- There won't be any issues.

03:23.469 --> 03:27.473
(Mimi peaking foreign language)

03:30.944 --> 03:33.580
(upbeat music)

03:35.381 --> 03:36.849
- Good day to you, feminine creatures of the divine.

03:36.849 --> 03:38.518
- [Monique] What do you need today, Boo?

03:38.518 --> 03:39.953
- Besides getting my fingers on the fly?

03:39.953 --> 03:41.287
I'm the kind of guy that's looking

03:41.287 --> 03:42.422
for a goddess from the sky.

03:42.422 --> 03:43.556
And yo miss Mo, if I might say,

03:43.556 --> 03:44.857
you're looking mighty fine.

03:44.857 --> 03:45.858
- [Monique] Boy, sit down.

03:45.858 --> 03:48.661
(dramatic music)

03:56.035 --> 03:56.903
- [Monique] Mani/pedi?

03:56.903 --> 03:58.504
Pick a color.

03:58.504 --> 04:00.506
- No actually, I'm here for work.

04:00.506 --> 04:02.675
My name's Amethyst, I'm the new receptionist.

04:02.675 --> 04:04.310
- Amethyst, welcome.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.913
Come on back, I'll get you started.

04:13.886 --> 04:16.555
(upbeat music)

04:18.057 --> 04:20.793
(phone ringing)

04:23.796 --> 04:26.666
(phone vibrating)

04:33.906 --> 04:36.309
(groaning)

04:41.414 --> 04:42.849
- [Sam] Hi, this is Sam.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.618
Leave your name and number, and I'll get.

04:47.086 --> 04:48.554
- Mom, I'm here!

05:06.005 --> 05:08.408
(coughing)

05:13.846 --> 05:15.982
(sobbing)

05:31.831 --> 05:32.699
Hey.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.068
Wake up, Sam.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.890
Mom, how long is this gonna be your routine?

05:57.890 --> 05:59.959
Come on, it's been weeks.

06:03.896 --> 06:06.833
I think you should talk to someone.

06:08.601 --> 06:12.472
In fact, you have an appointment today at noon.

06:14.841 --> 06:16.142
Come on, get dressed.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.811
(upbeat music)

06:32.425 --> 06:35.628
- Thank you so much for this opportunity.

06:35.628 --> 06:37.797
- Do the girls make you nervous?

06:37.797 --> 06:41.801
I mean, there are some strong personalities out there.

06:41.801 --> 06:44.670
We've just been through a lot, and the last girl,

06:44.670 --> 06:48.107
she was just full of some real shady shit.

06:48.107 --> 06:51.144
- I mean, I wouldn't really say nervous.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.846
I am an anxious person, and it takes me

06:53.846 --> 06:58.518
a moment to warm up, until I'm on, and at work, I'm on.

07:00.887 --> 07:03.990
I really do enjoy working with people,

07:03.990 --> 07:08.728
and being in a place that makes people feel beautiful

07:08.728 --> 07:12.799
and accepted for who they are is just for me.

07:12.799 --> 07:16.569
And girl, I am all about my glam jam.

07:16.569 --> 07:18.671
- Well, based on your resume,

07:18.671 --> 07:20.840
which I looked over very thoroughly,

07:20.840 --> 07:23.209
and our phone conversation,

07:23.209 --> 07:26.579
you seem like the right piece to our puzzle.

07:26.579 --> 07:29.248
I just wanna know, can you handle the pace?

07:29.248 --> 07:30.583
And the drama?

07:32.652 --> 07:36.989
Monique is hands down the best nail tech here.

07:36.989 --> 07:39.759
Girl takes her work seriously.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.828
She's been here the longest and tends to keep things

07:41.828 --> 07:44.697
in check when I'm not around.

07:44.697 --> 07:46.966
Now Mimi, she's pretty nuts.

07:48.534 --> 07:50.803
It don't take much to set her off.

07:50.803 --> 07:54.040
Honestly, if she weren't such a loyal, hardworking human

07:54.040 --> 07:56.776
that I love sort of like a daughter,

07:56.776 --> 07:58.878
I'd have her ass deported.

07:58.878 --> 08:02.615
Kelly who you met, she might seem like a hard ass,

08:02.615 --> 08:06.752
but she cares deeply about this place and our family.

08:06.752 --> 08:10.823
You should check her out on the turntables.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.059
- Yo, my feed is blowing up right now about this!

08:13.059 --> 08:14.026
Check it out!

08:14.026 --> 08:15.161
- Excuse me?

08:15.161 --> 08:17.129
Whatever happened to knocking?

08:17.129 --> 08:19.065
What's got you so worked up, girl?

08:19.065 --> 08:21.601
- Well, I got booked a DJ at this upscale fashion event,

08:21.601 --> 08:24.003
and it turns out that Elite LA is gonna be in the hood

08:24.003 --> 08:25.938
looking for the top nail salons

08:25.938 --> 08:27.707
to feature in their upcoming issue!

08:27.707 --> 08:30.810
- Kelly, we've been in LA Elite before.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.712
- I know, that's not all.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.679
I wanted to know more, so I copped the last issue

08:34.679 --> 08:39.085
and found out it's a contest, and the winner gets 50K.

08:40.986 --> 08:43.623
Linda, I seriously think that we could take this!

08:43.623 --> 08:45.291
You know we have the best talent in the area,

08:45.291 --> 08:47.960
and you know we could use that 50 Gs.

08:47.960 --> 08:51.631
- Well, you're right, we could use a little facelift,

08:51.631 --> 08:54.000
and a holiday bonus would be great.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.935
This has to be legit.

08:55.935 --> 08:57.136
- Oh my god, okay.

08:57.136 --> 08:58.971
We've got to get started on this.

08:58.971 --> 09:01.240
Don't worry, I'll DM the magazine, I'll set it all up.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.309
OMG, we're gonna kill it!

09:06.012 --> 09:08.781
- You know, she's right.

09:08.781 --> 09:11.984
We don't have a lot of competition in the area,

09:11.984 --> 09:13.986
we could really do this.

09:15.087 --> 09:16.923
- Let's win some money, mama.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.125
(giggling)

09:24.196 --> 09:27.366
- I really want to commend you for coming here today.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.869
I know how difficult it is to walk in that door,

09:29.869 --> 09:32.872
sit down, and bare your soul.

09:32.872 --> 09:33.739
I do.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.109
- My daughter did this.

09:37.109 --> 09:39.912
I'm wondering how old your kid has to be

09:39.912 --> 09:42.782
before it's too old to ground her.

09:44.383 --> 09:47.353
- Your daughter seems to be a wonderful young women.

09:47.353 --> 09:49.789
I know she really cares about you.

09:49.789 --> 09:54.660
Is there anything specific you would care to talk about?

09:54.660 --> 09:57.863
Any particular feelings you're feeling

09:57.863 --> 10:01.200
that are more present than others lately?

10:04.236 --> 10:08.641
- I'm not specifically feeling like talking at all.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.179
I'm deliberately isolating.

10:13.179 --> 10:16.983
I'm keeping to myself in order to process my pain.

10:16.983 --> 10:19.051
There's nothing wrong with that.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.120
- No, there really isn't anything wrong with that.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.190
We all have ways of processing pain.

10:24.190 --> 10:27.259
But we can get stuck in a loop,

10:27.259 --> 10:29.996
and that can be quite unhealthy.

10:31.731 --> 10:35.401
- Well, I do feel like I'm spinning most days.

10:37.036 --> 10:37.903
- Right.

10:39.705 --> 10:42.241
Your daughter tells me that you sold your business.

10:42.241 --> 10:46.912
She mentioned how much you loved being an entrepreneur.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.280
- I did.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.850
I was really good at it.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.686
I was so passionate about that business,

10:53.686 --> 10:57.089
but my ex fucked things up on every level.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.726
So eventually, I had to sell the business

11:00.726 --> 11:04.463
to sever all ties with him, and to save my ass.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.266
- The situation with your ex husband

11:07.266 --> 11:08.934
sounds pretty complicated.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.803
- Not going there.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.004
- I understand.

11:13.305 --> 11:14.173
I do.

11:16.042 --> 11:16.909
- Good.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.946
We understand each other.

11:20.946 --> 11:22.481
- When you're ready.

11:26.052 --> 11:30.990
Why don't we talk about what's making you feel whole again.

11:33.259 --> 11:37.496
What are you doing to embrace this new path that you're on?

11:37.496 --> 11:38.831
Any self care?

11:40.266 --> 11:42.068
- The new path I'm on

11:44.203 --> 11:45.971
is pretty bleak.

11:45.971 --> 11:48.741
My friend group is tarnished,

11:48.741 --> 11:51.177
and I don't wanna gossip about my ex

11:51.177 --> 11:53.079
and relive this nightmare of a divorce

11:53.079 --> 11:56.415
that I'm just trying to survive.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.751
I just don't fucking care.

12:00.419 --> 12:01.954
Get it?

12:01.954 --> 12:03.222
- I do.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.891
I do get it, it's very complex.

12:07.526 --> 12:11.263
I think the thing to do is to take a deep inhale.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.167
Stretch your arms out.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.370
Stretch a little to the right,

12:18.370 --> 12:20.005
stretching up to the spine,

12:20.005 --> 12:22.942
just letting go of all the tension.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.244
And you will.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.782
Sam?

12:29.782 --> 12:32.218
(upbeat music)

12:37.423 --> 12:38.891
- Yeah, I know.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.459
I guess it's been a while.

12:40.459 --> 12:42.128
- Where you been?

12:42.128 --> 12:44.530
I mean, I heard what happened.

12:46.465 --> 12:49.201
- Well, I've been in a loop,

12:49.201 --> 12:51.470
according to my fancy new shrink.

12:51.470 --> 12:54.073
- I saw your daughter a few days ago.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.876
She still comes in a good amount.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.013
You two have been coming here for so many years.

13:01.013 --> 13:03.015
- Gosh, I know.

13:03.015 --> 13:06.085
I used to bring her in here with me when she was, what?

13:06.085 --> 13:07.219
Four years old?

13:07.219 --> 13:09.555
Was she the cutest thing ever?

13:09.555 --> 13:12.358
We used to let her get a mini-mani.

13:12.358 --> 13:13.492
Not too short.

13:13.492 --> 13:15.261
God, she used to love getting

13:15.261 --> 13:17.496
her nails done with the ladies.

13:17.496 --> 13:19.165
- Did she tell you?

13:19.165 --> 13:22.234
- That's a loaded question with her.

13:22.234 --> 13:25.604
- We're planning to close our doors next month.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.239
Business just not the same.

13:27.239 --> 13:28.140
- No, you can't!

13:28.140 --> 13:29.975
That's insane.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.611
Just when I was beginning to feel like I could

13:32.611 --> 13:34.914
rely on something being there for me.

13:34.914 --> 13:37.416
- It's a shame, honey.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.018
Go wash your hands.

13:39.018 --> 13:41.353
Can I get you a water or tea?

13:43.155 --> 13:44.623
- I brought my own.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.397
(sniffling)

13:57.503 --> 14:00.139
Everything is bullshit.

14:00.139 --> 14:01.340
Bullshit.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.609
(sniffling)

14:11.584 --> 14:13.919
(sobbing)

14:13.919 --> 14:14.587
Thank you.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.360
Much better.

14:25.464 --> 14:27.333
Now this is what's up.

14:29.101 --> 14:33.572
I'd pay extra just to have someone bring me a glass of wine

14:34.640 --> 14:36.041
and some cute little snacks.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.544
(giggling)

14:38.544 --> 14:40.913
While I sit back and relax

14:40.913 --> 14:44.116
and tell the entire world to fuck off.

14:44.116 --> 14:45.985
Except for you, Miriam, not you.

14:45.985 --> 14:49.288
You're the best, you're so awesome.

14:49.288 --> 14:52.091
- Miss Sam, I like your thinking.

14:53.993 --> 14:56.128
(water gushing)

14:56.128 --> 14:57.596
Is the water too hot?

14:57.596 --> 14:59.298
(Sam laughing)

14:59.298 --> 15:00.599
- See?

15:00.599 --> 15:02.334
Is water too hot?

15:02.334 --> 15:05.037
You're the only person that cares about me.

15:05.037 --> 15:08.374
You pay attention to details and you know

15:09.942 --> 15:12.111
that if you're having an emotional crisis,

15:12.111 --> 15:14.546
you just need a drink.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.415
- Well, honey.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.651
You better get in while you can.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.654
This baby is moving on with her life.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.722
To tell you the truth,

15:23.722 --> 15:26.992
I was trying to get a loan in order to buy this place.

15:26.992 --> 15:30.329
Fix it up a bit, and bring in some luxury clientele,

15:30.329 --> 15:31.664
but bank said no.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.533
- No, no.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.504
You can't just let it go without a fight,

15:38.504 --> 15:41.073
you can't just let it turn to dust.

15:41.073 --> 15:43.475
What about all the memories?

15:43.475 --> 15:45.411
All the tiny toe nails?

15:48.347 --> 15:49.682
Banks are stupid.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.552
I'll give you the money, how much do you need?

15:53.552 --> 15:55.020
Bank of Sam.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.188
(laughing)

15:56.188 --> 15:58.290
My ex would squirm.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.360
- That is very kind of you.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.264
I think in the end, it's for the best.

16:05.264 --> 16:07.132
I don't really wanna take the pressure

16:07.132 --> 16:09.768
of running a business anymore.

16:09.768 --> 16:12.104
- No, you could do it, you'd love it.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.038
I loved it.

16:16.608 --> 16:17.543
I loved it.

16:21.213 --> 16:23.682
(upbeat music)

16:33.459 --> 16:36.261
(tranquil music)

16:37.129 --> 16:39.732
(metal clanking)

16:46.372 --> 16:48.173
- Just let it all go.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.714
Relax into the sweet sound of my voice

16:58.717 --> 17:01.787
as I tap, tap, tap you into serenity.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.095
- [Amethyst] Sorry.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.631
(Lola shushing)

17:14.400 --> 17:16.435
(banging)

17:16.435 --> 17:21.106
- You are surrendering to the touch of my soft fingers.

17:29.248 --> 17:33.552
Purging into the sacred space. (item banging on floor)

17:33.552 --> 17:35.220
I will keep you safe.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.855
(shushing)

17:36.855 --> 17:37.856
Baby, relax.

17:43.796 --> 17:44.663
- Sorry.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.269
- Who the fuck are you?

17:52.638 --> 17:55.374
- Hi, I'm Amethyst, I work here.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.210
- And what are you doing in here?

17:58.210 --> 18:00.279
You're costing me money, girl.

18:00.279 --> 18:03.248
- Yeah, I was just looking for supplies.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.717
- Supplies are across the hall.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.188
- [Amethyst] Sorry.

18:09.188 --> 18:13.725
- Oh, and let Linda know I need a lock put on that door.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.375
(phone vibrating)

18:31.243 --> 18:32.377
- Hello?

18:32.377 --> 18:33.846
- [Debt Collector] Hello.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.481
I am calling from City Collections.

18:35.481 --> 18:38.217
This is an opportunity to resolve the debt.

18:38.217 --> 18:40.919
I am looking for David Garcia.

18:40.919 --> 18:42.855
(upbeat music)

18:42.855 --> 18:46.792
♪ I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you ♪

18:48.660 --> 18:52.397
♪ I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you ♪

18:52.397 --> 18:53.465
(phone ringing)

18:53.465 --> 18:54.766
(Kristen shushing)

18:54.766 --> 18:55.901
- Oh crap.

18:55.901 --> 18:56.768
(Kristen shushing)

18:56.768 --> 18:58.437
(phone ringing)

18:58.437 --> 18:59.304
Hey mom.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.307
- [Sam] Hey baby.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.176
- You sound excited.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.445
(laughing) How did your therapy session go?

19:06.445 --> 19:08.881
- [Sam] It was good, I was hoping to tell you all about it.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.549
Are you home?

19:10.549 --> 19:12.885
- Yeah, I just got back from the gym.

19:15.554 --> 19:18.624
- [Sam] Great, I'll be over in a few.

19:19.858 --> 19:21.426
I've got the wine.

19:21.426 --> 19:22.494
- Okay, sure.

19:24.263 --> 19:27.332
Showering, then I'll make some iced tea, okay?

19:27.332 --> 19:28.534
Take your time.

19:29.868 --> 19:31.270
- Everything okay?

19:31.270 --> 19:32.204
- Oh, shit!

19:35.207 --> 19:38.343
Well, she's on her way with some big news.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.779
Seems like the counseling session went well.

19:40.779 --> 19:42.414
- Wait.

19:42.414 --> 19:43.916
You still haven't told her, have you?

19:43.916 --> 19:47.553
Sneaking around like this feels so strange.

19:47.553 --> 19:49.788
Kinda hot, but mostly strange.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.957
- Of course I haven't told her.

19:51.957 --> 19:54.526
No way, not with everything going on.

19:54.526 --> 19:57.262
She has been completely unstable.

19:57.262 --> 19:58.864
The last thing she needs are the details

19:58.864 --> 20:00.832
of who I'm sleeping with.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.467
Now go.

20:02.467 --> 20:03.468
- You know they're both gonna find out

20:03.468 --> 20:04.803
eventually, then what?

20:04.803 --> 20:05.671
- Go.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.378
I'm good right now.

20:14.646 --> 20:15.781
- More for me.

20:18.817 --> 20:19.685
So?

20:20.652 --> 20:21.587
How was it?

20:25.357 --> 20:30.028
- I never thought I'd be into that talk therapy thing,

20:30.028 --> 20:35.000
but I'm starting to embrace her words and take my life back.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.437
- Wow, that is so nice to hear.

20:39.471 --> 20:40.906
How so?

20:40.906 --> 20:43.842
- Well, I went to our spot today,

20:43.842 --> 20:47.713
and I treated myself to a mani/pedi.

20:47.713 --> 20:48.780
Felt so good.

20:50.048 --> 20:51.917
- Gosh.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.752
Yeah, I am so bummed that they're closing down.

20:53.752 --> 20:54.853
That place has been a staple in our lives

20:54.853 --> 20:56.588
for quite some time.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.457
- I know sweetheart.

20:58.457 --> 21:02.327
Miriam told me that they were gonna shut the doors soon.

21:02.327 --> 21:05.864
Well, it broke my little already demolished heart,

21:05.864 --> 21:07.065
so I bought it.

21:08.634 --> 21:09.501
- What?

21:10.936 --> 21:13.972
- Well, I couldn't just let it disappear.

21:13.972 --> 21:16.942
And my therapist is telling me I have to do things

21:16.942 --> 21:19.311
that make me happy.

21:19.311 --> 21:21.913
You know how much I loved running that business

21:21.913 --> 21:23.048
with your dickhead father.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.049
- Mom!

21:24.049 --> 21:25.984
- It just felt right.

21:25.984 --> 21:30.989
I want to create something beautiful and unique for people,

21:31.923 --> 21:33.525
and I need this, baby.

21:39.831 --> 21:41.366
- Of course, mom.

21:42.701 --> 21:45.103
You know dad is gonna freak, right?

21:45.103 --> 21:45.971
- Bingo.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.976
(upbeat music)

22:09.961 --> 22:12.964
- Great, honey, isn't this exciting?

22:13.932 --> 22:15.400
(phone ringing)

22:15.400 --> 22:16.935
Oh, these ones next.

22:18.470 --> 22:21.106
- Don't worry, I got it.

22:21.106 --> 22:23.775
(upbeat music)

22:53.171 --> 22:56.408
- Kristen, sweetheart, time to go get the keys!

22:56.408 --> 22:58.610
(laughing)

23:00.045 --> 23:02.080
Do you need some help?

23:02.080 --> 23:05.016
(Kristen groaning)

23:16.795 --> 23:17.929
- Girl, we're running out of time

23:17.929 --> 23:19.664
to get our entries dialed in.

23:19.664 --> 23:20.665
- I don't know if I have time for all this,

23:20.665 --> 23:22.067
I'm trying to work.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.735
- Hello, winning thousands of dollars

23:23.735 --> 23:26.104
doesn't sound like working it to you?

23:26.104 --> 23:28.140
- You really think we can do this?

23:28.140 --> 23:29.908
- Duh!

23:29.908 --> 23:31.810
But not if you don't practice some new techniques.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.478
Besides, I have a photo shoot tomorrow,

23:33.478 --> 23:35.781
and I need to look fly.

23:35.781 --> 23:39.851
Come on, I'll tag you online to build some steam.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.089
- All right, sit down.

23:45.056 --> 23:46.491
You're too much.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.965
(pages rustling)

23:55.233 --> 23:56.902
- [Linda] Amethyst!

23:56.902 --> 23:59.538
I need to talk to you, in the back.

24:00.672 --> 24:01.540
- Coming.

24:08.547 --> 24:09.915
- I got a phone call this morning

24:09.915 --> 24:11.883
from a bill collector looking for you.

24:11.883 --> 24:12.818
- Oh, shit.

24:14.619 --> 24:19.224
- They want me to garnish your wages from some old debt.

24:19.224 --> 24:22.527
Now of course I told them to fuck off.

24:22.527 --> 24:26.565
But listen, I'ma need to cut your hours.

24:26.565 --> 24:29.901
If you're full time, my hands are tied, and they will do

24:29.901 --> 24:33.638
whatever they need to do to get their money.

24:34.906 --> 24:37.242
I don't know what's going on,

24:37.242 --> 24:40.712
but you gon' have to get it together.

24:40.712 --> 24:41.980
- Thanks, Linda.

24:43.515 --> 24:46.117
(dramatic music)

24:49.588 --> 24:52.224
- Ooh girl, these look fly as hell!

24:52.224 --> 24:53.091
- Thank you.

24:53.091 --> 24:54.593
- Thank you.

24:54.593 --> 24:55.727
- [Linda] Ooh!

24:55.727 --> 24:57.896
- [Mimi] Oh, like Picasso nails.

24:57.896 --> 24:59.631
- Girl, you are so talented.

24:59.631 --> 25:00.632
- They look really good.

25:00.632 --> 25:02.734
- [Monique] Thank you.

25:02.734 --> 25:03.735
- Thank you.

25:06.238 --> 25:09.107
Ooh Linda, have you heard of this?

25:11.042 --> 25:13.178
- It's just another nail salon popping up.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.680
Seems like they come around, and then poof,

25:15.680 --> 25:18.016
they're gone in about six months.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.150
- Great.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.285
Like we need to slow down!

25:20.285 --> 25:21.086
(speaking foreign language)

25:21.086 --> 25:21.953
- Mimi!

25:21.953 --> 25:23.088
Relax.

25:23.088 --> 25:25.190
(Mimi speaking foreign language)

25:25.190 --> 25:26.958
- We need to run an ad or something,

25:26.958 --> 25:29.027
maybe pass out some coupons.

25:29.027 --> 25:32.197
I could create a discount code and share it online.

25:32.197 --> 25:35.333
- That, and how about we win ourselves some money?

25:35.333 --> 25:36.868
- Ooh bitch, yes!

25:39.070 --> 25:42.741
- Let me know what you girls need, I'm here to support you.

25:42.741 --> 25:43.909
- Okay, we're doing this.

25:43.909 --> 25:46.878
- We're totally gonna win.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.648
(tranquil music)

25:54.886 --> 25:57.956
(knocking at door)

25:57.956 --> 25:58.823
- What?

26:02.327 --> 26:03.728
Can I help you?

26:07.299 --> 26:11.603
- Yay, I've been waiting for this package!

26:11.603 --> 26:13.004
- What is that?

26:13.004 --> 26:15.907
- My clients are going to love this.

26:17.676 --> 26:20.278
- Well, aren't you gonna open that?

26:20.278 --> 26:25.183
- Yeah, of course, but not until the cameras are rolling.

26:25.183 --> 26:27.052
- I'm not sure I follow.

26:27.052 --> 26:29.654
- I do all of my unboxing on camera.

26:29.654 --> 26:31.923
It's all about sensory play.

26:37.195 --> 26:40.932
(plastic rustling)

26:40.932 --> 26:42.200
Close your eyes.

26:44.970 --> 26:45.837
Listen.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.409
Get lost in the soothing sound

26:54.079 --> 26:56.281
and let my voice guide you.

27:01.319 --> 27:02.187
(phone buzzing)

27:02.187 --> 27:03.088
- Oh, shit!

27:03.088 --> 27:03.955
Sorry.

27:07.125 --> 27:10.895
So that's supposed to be like relaxing, right?

27:10.895 --> 27:15.033
- Some find it relaxing, some find it stimulating.

27:16.801 --> 27:20.372
It's all about specific sounds, sights, and feelings.

27:22.874 --> 27:25.143
ASMR is quite magical.

27:25.143 --> 27:26.011
- ASMR?

27:27.412 --> 27:30.815
- Autonomous sensory meridian response.

27:32.217 --> 27:35.720
It's meant to make you tingle up your spine,

27:36.755 --> 27:38.156
back of your neck.

27:39.891 --> 27:42.027
Those warm, fuzzy feelings that come over you

27:42.027 --> 27:44.162
when you experience bliss.

27:45.964 --> 27:49.000
I can control that in people.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.904
Direct the experience and take them on a journey.

27:52.904 --> 27:55.173
It's really quite profound.

27:55.173 --> 27:58.309
- And people are like actually into this?

27:58.309 --> 27:59.711
- All about it.

28:01.312 --> 28:06.217
Imagine being able to just turn the world off for a while

28:07.986 --> 28:10.989
without using drugs or alcohol to tune things out.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.359
- Food for thought.

28:16.061 --> 28:18.930
(energetic music)

28:21.366 --> 28:23.802
- We give the best mani/pedis in town.

28:23.802 --> 28:24.469
Let me see your hands.

28:24.469 --> 28:26.037
- [Guy] Sure.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.472
- Oh, we could buff your nails up,

28:27.472 --> 28:30.275
give you a nice shine, maybe massage your hands

28:30.275 --> 28:32.777
with some silky smooth lotion.

28:32.777 --> 28:34.112
- Oh, you need pedicure!

28:34.112 --> 28:35.947
Nasty toe, hey I heard you!

28:35.947 --> 28:37.215
- Yo, Mimi!

28:37.215 --> 28:38.850
Yo, Mimi!

28:38.850 --> 28:40.518
I don't think your approach is working.

28:40.518 --> 28:43.188
Come on, let's go get a drink and try a different spot.

28:43.188 --> 28:44.055
Let's go.

28:47.792 --> 28:48.860
What is this?

28:50.295 --> 28:51.896
What's sticking out?

28:51.896 --> 28:52.530
- Come on.

28:53.431 --> 28:54.766
This is crazy.

28:57.268 --> 29:00.905
Oh my god, the chairs look like thrones!

29:00.905 --> 29:03.108
- They're not messing around, are they?

29:03.108 --> 29:05.777
(upbeat music)

29:09.147 --> 29:10.482
- This means war.

29:16.254 --> 29:17.388
- [Kelly] Oh my god, that place is crazy!

29:17.388 --> 29:18.990
- [Mimi] I know, so crazy!

29:18.990 --> 29:20.191
- [Kelly] How are we gonna compete with that?

29:20.191 --> 29:22.093
- [Mimi] I don't know about this!

29:22.093 --> 29:23.495
- These coupons better work, or we're totally screwed!

29:23.495 --> 29:25.897
- You girls get worked up so easily.

29:25.897 --> 29:27.365
So what?

29:27.365 --> 29:29.267
There's a new nail salon opening up.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.803
That's why we're getting out here and getting new business.

29:31.803 --> 29:33.505
- Yeah, but this place is off the hook.

29:33.505 --> 29:37.041
They have these crazy chairs, and so many mirrors.

29:37.041 --> 29:39.277
- Yeah, and all the polish!

29:39.277 --> 29:41.846
- They're decorating right now and holding interviews.

29:41.846 --> 29:42.914
- Okay, okay.

29:44.549 --> 29:48.153
Would it make you all feel better if I go check it out?

29:48.153 --> 29:49.154
- [All] Yes!

29:52.524 --> 29:55.260
(upbeat music)

29:55.260 --> 29:58.229
- All right mom, where do you want it?

29:58.229 --> 30:00.598
- I say right in the front door.

30:00.598 --> 30:03.501
(upbeat music)

30:03.501 --> 30:06.304
(Mimi screaming)

30:24.589 --> 30:25.890
- Linda!

30:25.890 --> 30:27.292
Linda!

30:27.292 --> 30:28.226
Come on in.

30:34.532 --> 30:36.267
- Hi, Sam.

30:36.267 --> 30:38.570
- I couldn't help but notice a bunch of folks

30:38.570 --> 30:41.039
peering into my window.

30:41.039 --> 30:44.242
Who would have ever guessed it would be you.

30:44.242 --> 30:45.910
- Yes.

30:45.910 --> 30:47.278
I just heard there was a little salon

30:47.278 --> 30:48.913
opening up down the street.

30:48.913 --> 30:50.582
I thought I'd come check it out.

30:50.582 --> 30:53.885
- Yes, this is my new luxury nail house.

30:53.885 --> 30:58.890
We're just adding the finishing touches until we launch.

31:00.258 --> 31:02.060
My daughter Kristen's going to help me run it.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.062
Isn't it beautiful?

31:04.062 --> 31:05.129
- It's okay.

31:05.129 --> 31:06.130
- Kristen!

31:06.130 --> 31:07.932
Kristen, sweetheart.

31:07.932 --> 31:11.269
Meet the regular nail salon owner, Linda.

31:12.637 --> 31:13.504
The Linda.

31:17.475 --> 31:19.277
- I've heard a lot about you.

31:19.277 --> 31:21.479
- I bet you have, Kristen.

31:21.479 --> 31:23.948
- Listen, I'd love to stay and continue

31:23.948 --> 31:27.452
this precious little talk, but I have things to do.

31:27.452 --> 31:28.319
Goodbye.

31:33.358 --> 31:36.094
(Sam laughing)

31:36.094 --> 31:37.629
- I don't know how we're gonna complete with that salon.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.197
Our coupons better work,

31:39.197 --> 31:42.033
or we're totally screwed in this contest.

31:42.033 --> 31:43.434
- What we gonna do?

31:43.434 --> 31:45.270
Those bitches gonna snake all our business!

31:45.270 --> 31:48.640
- We don't know that for sure, just relax for a minute.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.708
- Yo Linda, Mimi has a point.

31:50.708 --> 31:52.644
We're all starting to trip.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.979
- I mean, who the hell does this girl even think she is?

31:54.979 --> 31:56.581
Just rolling up in on us like that?

31:56.581 --> 31:58.149
Acting like she owns the place?

31:58.149 --> 31:59.017
Girl.

32:00.952 --> 32:01.686
- It's Sam.

32:03.388 --> 32:07.125
She always has to have her way, at any cost.

32:09.694 --> 32:11.462
Always has.

32:11.462 --> 32:13.264
(gentle chiming bells)

32:13.264 --> 32:16.434
(upbeat music)

32:16.434 --> 32:18.369
(Linda laughing)

32:18.369 --> 32:20.305
Sammy, Sammy, oh my gosh!

32:20.305 --> 32:22.540
Look at what Kyle left in my locker this morning.

32:22.540 --> 32:23.975
(Sam yelling)

32:23.975 --> 32:25.343
- [Sam] Oh wow, Linda.

32:25.343 --> 32:26.344
- I know!

32:26.344 --> 32:27.245
- That's exciting!

32:27.245 --> 32:29.180
- I know!

32:29.180 --> 32:30.214
- I wish someone would leave a note for me in my locker.

32:30.214 --> 32:31.616
- Oh!

32:31.616 --> 32:33.651
- Well, other than Chubby Ronnie.

32:33.651 --> 32:36.654
- I think this means that he wants to take me

32:36.654 --> 32:38.589
to the house party this weekend.

32:38.589 --> 32:42.393
You know, the one with the football player's house?

32:42.393 --> 32:43.261
(Linda yelling)

32:43.261 --> 32:44.729
Okay, okay.

32:44.729 --> 32:46.664
You can come too, you can totally come too.

32:46.664 --> 32:48.232
We need to go shopping!

32:48.232 --> 32:49.100
Oh my!

32:49.100 --> 32:51.636
(Linda yelling)

32:56.007 --> 32:57.642
Shit, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.277
I should probably go pee before we head out.

32:59.277 --> 33:00.411
- [Kyle] Oh, I wanna go pee too.

33:00.411 --> 33:02.046
- [Linda] No.

33:02.046 --> 33:02.714
I need to get him some water too.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.015
- Good idea.

33:04.015 --> 33:06.150
I got him. - Pee-pee time?

33:06.150 --> 33:07.218
- Buddy?

33:07.218 --> 33:08.353
- Yeah?

33:08.353 --> 33:09.120
- You feeling good, or what?

33:09.120 --> 33:09.754
- Yeah.

33:11.723 --> 33:14.225
Yeah, where's Linda?

33:14.225 --> 33:15.626
I'm thirsty.

33:15.626 --> 33:16.661
- She's gonna go grab you some water.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.563
- Yeah?

33:18.563 --> 33:21.599
- Why don't we have a bit of fun in the meantime?

33:25.436 --> 33:26.804
Do you like touching these?

33:26.804 --> 33:28.673
- Girl, what are you doing?

33:28.673 --> 33:31.642
- Hey, what? (Kyle babbling)

33:31.642 --> 33:33.044
- It's fun.

33:33.044 --> 33:34.178
- That's it. - A massage.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.414
- Do you like touching these?

33:36.414 --> 33:37.281
- Yeah.

33:38.516 --> 33:39.784
I like touching.

33:45.123 --> 33:46.124
- That bathroom was small.

33:46.124 --> 33:47.291
Well, here's his water.

33:47.291 --> 33:50.294
- Oh, hi babe. - [Linda] What?

33:50.294 --> 33:51.162
Fuck you!

33:51.162 --> 33:53.231
(Kyle groaning)

33:53.231 --> 33:54.732
- Get your hands off of me you jerk!

33:54.732 --> 33:55.666
Linda!

33:55.666 --> 33:56.667
- What?

33:56.667 --> 33:58.669
What is happening?

33:58.669 --> 34:00.371
- Any time she's had the opportunity

34:00.371 --> 34:03.775
to tear me down or outdo me, she's all over it.

34:03.775 --> 34:05.309
- What a bitch!

34:05.309 --> 34:06.511
- The ultimate bitch!

34:06.511 --> 34:07.378
- I kill that bitch!

34:07.378 --> 34:08.246
- Mimi!

34:08.246 --> 34:09.679
Don't do that!

34:09.679 --> 34:13.150
- Look, we need to take her down proper.

34:15.652 --> 34:17.321
- The magazine contest!

34:17.321 --> 34:18.589
- How's that gonna work?

34:18.589 --> 34:20.625
She doesn't even know about it.

34:20.625 --> 34:21.859
- Not yet.

34:21.859 --> 34:23.795
But there's one spot open,

34:23.795 --> 34:25.463
and you know as soon as she knows that you're competing,

34:25.463 --> 34:27.665
she's gonna be all over it.

34:32.437 --> 34:33.304
Come on.

34:41.579 --> 34:42.746
(bouncy music)

34:42.746 --> 34:44.148
- Okay, Vivian.

34:45.882 --> 34:49.187
Looks like you've worked with Miriam before.

34:49.187 --> 34:51.222
She is currently our lead technician, and we need to hire

34:51.222 --> 34:53.424
a few more solid people to join the team.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.726
- I do nail very well.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.662
- Great.

34:57.662 --> 35:00.498
See, we are aiming to offer a very special experience here.

35:00.498 --> 35:03.267
What else would make you a good fit here?

35:03.267 --> 35:04.869
- No happy ending.

35:04.869 --> 35:06.604
I do very nice nail.

35:10.741 --> 35:12.210
- Of course not.

35:13.377 --> 35:14.712
But we are not looking to offer

35:14.712 --> 35:17.315
that kind of service here, no.

35:19.584 --> 35:22.420
Just something a little more personal,

35:22.420 --> 35:24.722
like offering a glass of wine with a pedicure,

35:24.722 --> 35:26.591
and a choice of scrub.

35:27.925 --> 35:29.727
That sort of thing.

35:29.727 --> 35:31.929
- I not a bartender.

35:31.929 --> 35:32.797
I do nail.

35:36.334 --> 35:38.803
(upbeat music)

35:40.505 --> 35:42.306
- Excuse me a minute.

35:45.843 --> 35:48.479
- [Kelly] How's the recruiting coming along?

35:48.479 --> 35:49.814
- Great, yeah.

35:49.814 --> 35:50.681
Great.

35:52.216 --> 35:53.618
- We thought you might be interested

35:53.618 --> 35:55.720
in this little contest coming up.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.756
Might help you build a reputation, bring in some business.

35:58.756 --> 36:00.525
- Okay, why are you showing me this?

36:00.525 --> 36:02.860
Knowing there's beef between Sam and Linda?

36:02.860 --> 36:05.530
My mom was a hot mess last night after that run-in,

36:05.530 --> 36:07.899
not to mention what this is doing to my personal life.

36:07.899 --> 36:09.300
- We're just trying to make sure

36:09.300 --> 36:10.968
everybody gets a shot here, okay?

36:10.968 --> 36:13.804
And hey, maybe we could figure all this drama stuff out,

36:13.804 --> 36:16.741
through a fair and square competition.

36:16.741 --> 36:20.945
Plus, the winner walks away with a chunk of change.

36:24.348 --> 36:25.483
- Gee, thanks.

36:26.717 --> 36:27.585
Bitch.

36:31.222 --> 36:32.390
- Hi. - [Kristen] Hi.

36:32.390 --> 36:33.691
- I'm here for the job opening.

36:33.691 --> 36:34.559
- Great.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.530
Have a seat, I'll be with you in just a minute.

36:46.504 --> 36:47.371
- Hey you!

36:48.239 --> 36:48.973
- Ben, hey!

36:50.007 --> 36:51.342
What are you doing here?

36:51.342 --> 36:52.743
- Thought I'd come say hi.

36:52.743 --> 36:53.744
Besides, you've been pretty much living here

36:53.744 --> 36:54.779
and I miss my girl.

36:56.314 --> 36:58.516
Figure I can check out the space.

36:58.516 --> 37:00.284
It's looking good.

37:00.284 --> 37:01.752
- Thanks, but seriously,

37:01.752 --> 37:03.287
I don't think you should just be showing up here.

37:03.287 --> 37:04.722
I mean, what if Sam sees us?

37:04.722 --> 37:06.524
- Come on, this isn't high school.

37:06.524 --> 37:07.792
Who cares if she sees us?

37:07.792 --> 37:09.393
- You just don't get it.

37:09.393 --> 37:12.430
Your mom might not care about us dating.

37:14.332 --> 37:15.967
By the way, have you said anything?

37:15.967 --> 37:17.802
I mean, a couple of Linda's girls came by here

37:17.802 --> 37:19.437
and they said some things that made me worry.

37:19.437 --> 37:20.605
- Just lighten up, okay?

37:20.605 --> 37:22.506
It's gonna be fine.

37:22.506 --> 37:23.841
- You better go.

37:23.841 --> 37:25.476
I have one more interview

37:25.476 --> 37:26.844
that should be here any moment, okay?

37:26.844 --> 37:28.713
I'll call you tonight.

37:31.382 --> 37:34.051
(Kristen sighing)

37:41.392 --> 37:43.294
- Kristen baby, the next girl is here.

37:43.294 --> 37:44.829
- Great, thanks mom.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.833
(dramatic music)

37:54.739 --> 37:57.341
- Yes, hello, I'm calling to report

37:57.341 --> 37:59.477
a violation of nail salon.

38:00.544 --> 38:04.382
Nectar Nails, N-E-C-T-A-R.

38:05.383 --> 38:06.884
Filthy, filthy, dirty.

38:06.884 --> 38:08.753
I've been going there for years,

38:08.753 --> 38:10.354
but it's gotten out of control,

38:10.354 --> 38:13.791
and I feel like it's my duty to report them.

38:13.791 --> 38:18.329
I'm 99% sure that I got my toenail fungus there.

38:19.330 --> 38:20.598
My left big toe.

38:22.333 --> 38:25.603
And also, I'm almost positive they have illegals.

38:26.671 --> 38:28.706
Illegals working there, yes.

38:28.706 --> 38:31.676
Thank you so much, I just think someone should really

38:31.676 --> 38:33.878
get over there as soon as possible.

38:33.878 --> 38:34.879
It's urgent.

38:34.879 --> 38:36.380
You're so welcome.

38:38.416 --> 38:40.718
(laughing)

38:40.718 --> 38:42.119
- All right, we'll see you later today.

38:42.119 --> 38:43.654
Okay thanks, bye.

38:44.889 --> 38:46.724
It's gonna be a busy one today.

38:46.724 --> 38:51.062
I guess those coupons you ladies hustled worked after all.

38:51.062 --> 38:53.497
- Sometimes you just gotta put yourself out there.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.633
Show the world who you are.

38:55.633 --> 38:57.601
You should never be afraid to shine.

38:57.601 --> 38:59.603
- Girl, I'm not trying to be all up on the internet.

38:59.603 --> 39:02.606
I know, again, just trying to build some steam

39:02.606 --> 39:05.109
for the competition that we're gonna rock.

39:05.109 --> 39:07.011
- Okay, girl, okay.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.612
Thanks for the press and all,

39:08.612 --> 39:10.014
but I have got to get mentally prepared

39:10.014 --> 39:12.483
for this contest and my first client.

39:12.483 --> 39:14.652
Mrs. Hamilton's coming in today.

39:14.652 --> 39:16.787
Oh my god, that woman, she thinks I'm her therapist.

39:16.787 --> 39:19.690
Story after story, drama after drama.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.159
- Goes with the territory, boo.

39:23.994 --> 39:25.830
- Mrs. Hamilton, nice to see you.

39:25.830 --> 39:27.531
Pick a color and come on back.

39:27.531 --> 39:28.399
- What?

39:29.467 --> 39:31.602
I don't want the color purple,

39:31.602 --> 39:33.771
and I want a pedicure too.

39:33.771 --> 39:35.039
- Okay, hon.

39:35.039 --> 39:36.107
Pick a color!

39:38.876 --> 39:42.113
- Oh, have I got a story for you today,

39:42.113 --> 39:44.415
you will be just die.

39:44.415 --> 39:46.617
(laughing)

39:48.819 --> 39:51.489
(upbeat music)

39:52.857 --> 39:54.525
- [Mimi] What are you up to, new girl?

39:54.525 --> 39:57.428
- Oh, just ordering some supplies for the salon.

39:57.428 --> 39:59.997
And Mimi, I've been working here for a while now,

39:59.997 --> 40:02.733
you don't have to call me new girl.

40:02.733 --> 40:06.871
- You're still new girl, and I can't say your name.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.506
- Understandable.

40:08.506 --> 40:09.874
Is there something you're looking for?

40:09.874 --> 40:11.509
- No.

40:11.509 --> 40:12.643
I usually like to smoke some weed

40:12.643 --> 40:14.845
before my first client come in.

40:17.882 --> 40:22.219
- No thank you, I'm already anxious enough as it is.

40:22.219 --> 40:24.054
- Chill me out.

40:24.054 --> 40:26.056
- [Kelly] Mimi, you're next client's waiting!

40:26.056 --> 40:28.859
- Damn girl, I'm coming, I'm coming!

40:28.859 --> 40:32.930
(Mimi speaking foreign language)

40:36.200 --> 40:38.869
(upbeat music)

40:40.237 --> 40:41.705
- It's another fine day, and if I may say,

40:41.705 --> 40:43.474
you are stealing it today.

40:43.474 --> 40:44.141
- I got you today.

40:44.141 --> 40:45.176
The usual?

40:45.176 --> 40:46.877
- Yes. - Okay, come on.

40:57.087 --> 40:59.490
- Hey hon, it's gonna be a bout a 30 minute wait,

40:59.490 --> 41:01.692
so if you just wanna pick out some colors--

41:01.692 --> 41:04.929
- Actually, I don't need my nails done, thanks.

41:04.929 --> 41:06.964
Sam actually sent me over here to tell you

41:06.964 --> 41:08.566
that we accept your challenge.

41:08.566 --> 41:10.534
You know, the nail contest?

41:10.534 --> 41:11.569
- Oh bitch, I know.

41:11.569 --> 41:13.037
- She wrote a note.

41:15.539 --> 41:17.741
Linda and her girls better bring their A-game,

41:17.741 --> 41:19.844
we plan to take this by a landslide.

41:19.844 --> 41:22.713
There'll be no doubt who has the best salon in town.

41:22.713 --> 41:24.215
(angry chattering)

41:24.215 --> 41:25.216
- She sent you?

41:25.216 --> 41:27.117
(angry chattering)

41:27.117 --> 41:30.054
- Now, now ladies, let's not go and kill the messenger.

41:30.054 --> 41:32.590
She delivered the news, and now y'all got the blues.

41:32.590 --> 41:35.159
Can't you see this is predetermined and meant to be?

41:35.159 --> 41:38.262
Sam is just trying to steer the pot, hear me now.

41:38.262 --> 41:39.964
Finger and finger, and toe to toe will go

41:39.964 --> 41:41.966
until the winner will go to the throne.

41:41.966 --> 41:43.634
So create from the heart, 'cause that's the start,

41:43.634 --> 41:46.003
and true art will prevail.

41:46.003 --> 41:47.004
- Thanks for that?

41:47.004 --> 41:48.172
- My pleasure, pony.

41:48.172 --> 41:49.540
- Pony?

41:49.540 --> 41:51.208
Pleasure pony?

41:51.208 --> 41:52.543
- [Man In Cap] What do you go by on this Earthly ground?

41:52.543 --> 41:54.011
- Are you asking me my name?

41:54.011 --> 41:55.613
Aurora.

41:55.613 --> 41:57.281
Aurora, seems I was wrong all along,

41:57.281 --> 42:01.652
my dear, you are dancing light, a prism of rainbows,

42:01.652 --> 42:04.588
and unicorn out of sight.

42:04.588 --> 42:06.657
- Thanks for that.

42:06.657 --> 42:08.559
I should go back to work.

42:08.559 --> 42:10.094
- Until then is now, may your day be filled with much wow,

42:10.094 --> 42:11.896
my mythical creature.

42:15.132 --> 42:17.801
(gentle music)

42:24.642 --> 42:26.143
- God, that looks delicious.

42:26.143 --> 42:29.113
(phone buzzing)

42:29.113 --> 42:30.748
Linda.

42:30.748 --> 42:32.816
That can go to voicemail.

42:34.184 --> 42:35.886
- Seriously, what's the deal with you two?

42:35.886 --> 42:37.755
Like, how long has this been going on?

42:37.755 --> 42:40.891
- Ever since your dad and I got together, it's been a thing.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.627
(phone ringing)

42:45.062 --> 42:46.664
- Speaking of dad.

42:48.365 --> 42:49.233
Hey dad.

42:51.335 --> 42:52.770
Good, good yeah.

42:55.639 --> 42:56.640
Oh, you are?

42:58.208 --> 43:01.078
Well, I'll be around, if you wanna stop by

43:01.078 --> 43:03.080
or grab a cup of coffee.

43:05.182 --> 43:06.750
Great, dad.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.752
Yeah, I look forward to seeing you.

43:08.752 --> 43:09.620
Okay, bye.

43:11.021 --> 43:13.090
- I take it your dad is coming through now.

43:13.090 --> 43:14.758
Did you tell him about the salon?

43:14.758 --> 43:17.027
- No, I'm sure he already knows.

43:17.027 --> 43:19.697
Plus, I don't wanna contribute to extra drama.

43:19.697 --> 43:21.699
We have enough going on.

43:23.300 --> 43:27.771
- Did you tell him about the boy you've been dating?

43:31.842 --> 43:33.143
- Mom, I--

43:33.143 --> 43:34.912
- Sweetheart, it's all right.

43:34.912 --> 43:36.680
It's all right.

43:36.680 --> 43:38.115
How long did you think

43:38.115 --> 43:39.683
you were gonna hide it from me anyway?

43:39.683 --> 43:41.418
You're allowed to date, for Christ's sake.

43:41.418 --> 43:43.187
Just because your father and I couldn't hold it together

43:43.187 --> 43:45.122
doesn't mean there isn't hope for you.

43:45.122 --> 43:47.224
And besides, from what I could tell, he's kinda cute.

43:47.224 --> 43:49.793
Give me some more ice cream.

43:49.793 --> 43:50.928
- Okay.

43:50.928 --> 43:53.097
- Just promise me something.

43:54.665 --> 43:58.102
If this gets serious, I wanna meet him, okay?

44:00.804 --> 44:01.805
- Sure, mom.

44:03.874 --> 44:04.742
- Cheers.

44:08.145 --> 44:10.314
(dramatic music)

44:10.314 --> 44:13.183
(heavy breathing)

44:19.390 --> 44:20.791
- You got this.

44:22.459 --> 44:23.794
You need this.

44:27.164 --> 44:29.166
It's all gonna work out.

44:30.300 --> 44:32.236
It's all gonna be fine.

44:49.119 --> 44:51.855
(phone ringing)

44:54.725 --> 44:56.093
- [Robotic Voice] Please leave your message.

44:56.093 --> 44:56.960
(phone beeping)

44:56.960 --> 44:58.328
- Hi dad.

44:58.328 --> 44:59.196
It's me.

45:01.098 --> 45:03.233
I know it's been a minute,

45:05.002 --> 45:08.906
I could really use somebody to talk to right now.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.243
You know, like family.

45:15.779 --> 45:17.915
I hope you understand that

45:21.251 --> 45:22.319
I'm still me.

45:27.224 --> 45:29.460
Could you just call me?

45:29.460 --> 45:32.129
(somber music)

45:36.467 --> 45:39.203
(phone buzzing)

45:44.408 --> 45:45.275
- David.

45:46.443 --> 45:47.311
My son.

45:49.146 --> 45:53.817
I struggle every day with the choices that you've made.

45:55.786 --> 45:57.121
Don't support it.

46:01.291 --> 46:05.496
Of your life, which is why I've cut you off.

46:05.496 --> 46:06.897
My fucking dad!

46:11.935 --> 46:13.070
- Okay, David.

46:17.941 --> 46:18.809
Okay.

46:20.144 --> 46:21.478
Tell me a bit more about your experience

46:21.478 --> 46:23.580
in a beauty salon environment.

46:23.580 --> 46:25.149
- Well, I've always been a fan

46:25.149 --> 46:27.518
of all things beauty and fashion,

46:29.119 --> 46:30.521
I actually went to school for design,

46:30.521 --> 46:33.924
and I've worked for a couple salons.

46:33.924 --> 46:36.160
I'm all about glam.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.294
- Okay, great!

46:39.463 --> 46:41.265
Are you okay with working weekends?

46:41.265 --> 46:43.200
Right now we have a part time opening.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.102
- Yeah, totally, that's fine.

46:45.102 --> 46:47.371
I'm actually also available for after hours,

46:47.371 --> 46:48.605
or any extra time.

46:48.605 --> 46:49.973
- Perfect.

46:49.973 --> 46:51.842
(upbeat music)

46:51.842 --> 46:54.178
- Hey loves, it's your girl, Kelly Styles!

46:54.178 --> 46:57.080
And I'm out here in beautiful Los Angeles, California.

46:57.080 --> 46:59.917
I'm so excited to tell you about this upcoming event.

46:59.917 --> 47:01.919
So the nail salon that I work at

47:01.919 --> 47:04.221
is in this dope magazine contest,

47:04.221 --> 47:06.857
and we've got a chance to win some big bucks.

47:06.857 --> 47:08.892
So, we could really use your help.

47:08.892 --> 47:11.895
Come on down next week and witness all the fun for yourself.

47:11.895 --> 47:14.565
Yours truly is gonna be throwing down some sick beats,

47:14.565 --> 47:16.400
so that you can shake it while we all watch

47:16.400 --> 47:20.204
who will be Elite LA's top nail salon.

47:20.204 --> 47:22.005
Make sure that you guys like this video

47:22.005 --> 47:24.408
and share it with your homies!

47:29.146 --> 47:31.949
(tranquil music)

47:33.417 --> 47:36.253
(nails clicking)

47:36.253 --> 47:37.120
- Yes.

47:40.657 --> 47:41.525
Yes.

47:44.595 --> 47:47.397
(water swishing)

47:49.199 --> 47:50.067
Soft.

47:52.569 --> 47:53.437
Slippery.

47:55.539 --> 47:56.406
Sticky.

47:59.576 --> 48:00.444
Slime.

48:03.614 --> 48:05.549
(knocking at door)

48:05.549 --> 48:06.416
Dammit!

48:07.584 --> 48:08.919
Yeah, come in.

48:10.254 --> 48:12.022
- Hey girl, you got another package.

48:12.022 --> 48:14.057
- Just sit it over there.

48:15.659 --> 48:17.127
Hand me a towel?

48:18.462 --> 48:21.999
- Slime, how is that supposed to be relaxing?

48:24.701 --> 48:27.104
- You don't get it, do you?

48:28.472 --> 48:31.441
Anything can be ASMR if presented properly.

48:33.343 --> 48:34.578
(Amethyst laughing)

48:34.578 --> 48:36.446
- Is that right?

48:36.446 --> 48:38.248
- I make these custom videos for some of my clients.

48:38.248 --> 48:40.450
They basically get to write the script,

48:40.450 --> 48:43.520
and choose what medium I work with.

48:43.520 --> 48:44.588
- Okay.

48:44.588 --> 48:47.090
- Pays really well.

48:47.090 --> 48:49.226
I might need an assistant.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.495
You into weird shit?

48:51.495 --> 48:52.496
- I could be.

48:52.496 --> 48:54.965
(laughing)

48:54.965 --> 48:55.632
Don't mind if I do.

48:55.632 --> 48:57.100
(laughing)

48:57.100 --> 48:58.368
- Dive in, baby.

48:59.536 --> 49:02.372
- Finally, the time has come!

49:02.372 --> 49:04.107
- Smile, mom!

49:04.107 --> 49:05.175
- Did you get it?

49:05.175 --> 49:06.543
- Yeah. It looks great.

49:06.543 --> 49:08.145
- Thanks, baby!

49:08.145 --> 49:12.182
Let's open the doors and pop that champagne!

It's been crazy busy, but we're managing.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.662
- Yeah, same here.

49:58.662 --> 50:01.031
And how's your mother?

50:01.031 --> 50:03.367
- You gotta say it like that?

50:04.234 --> 50:05.502
She's been okay.

50:07.337 --> 50:08.472
- That's good, I'm sure she's probably

50:08.472 --> 50:10.474
drowning herself in her sorrows.

50:10.474 --> 50:11.341
(clicking tongue)

50:11.341 --> 50:12.676
(laughing)

50:12.676 --> 50:15.212
- Yeah, she's embracing life.

50:16.713 --> 50:19.249
- Sure moving on then.

50:19.249 --> 50:20.283
- Something like that.

50:20.283 --> 50:22.185
- Yeah?

50:22.185 --> 50:25.188
Well, I caught wind of this recent acquisition, actually.

50:25.188 --> 50:27.124
- Dad, about that, she's--

50:27.124 --> 50:28.692
- Oh no, no, I don't want anything to do with that.

50:28.692 --> 50:31.428
I'm moving on, I'm trying to be separate

50:31.428 --> 50:34.164
from your mother and her antics.

50:35.632 --> 50:37.200
- You okay?

50:37.200 --> 50:39.202
- I'm all right, honey.

50:39.202 --> 50:40.604
It's really good to see you.

50:40.604 --> 50:43.140
- Yeah, it's so good to see you too.

50:44.074 --> 50:44.741
- Girl.

50:47.244 --> 50:49.112
(upbeat music)

50:49.112 --> 50:51.481
- Good day to you, fabulously friendly female.

50:51.481 --> 50:53.383
Hello!

50:53.383 --> 50:54.718
Welcome to Unique Nails, do you have an appointment today?

50:54.718 --> 50:56.586
- No appointment necessary.

50:56.586 --> 50:58.655
You see, I will wait patiently for my unicorn to appear,

50:58.655 --> 51:00.323
and when she does, I have no fear

51:00.323 --> 51:03.593
that the magic will manifest right here.

51:04.761 --> 51:05.629
- Okay.

51:08.799 --> 51:11.701
Have you seen our list of luxury mani/pedi services?

51:11.701 --> 51:16.573
- The only luxury I need is the touch of that noble steed.

51:16.573 --> 51:17.441
- Okay.

51:18.842 --> 51:21.545
Let me check her schedule, have a seat.

51:21.545 --> 51:22.412
Please.

51:27.184 --> 51:28.652
- Oh, girl.

51:28.652 --> 51:30.654
You okay? Everything okay?

51:30.654 --> 51:32.522
- Well there's this guy, he wants to work with Aurora,

51:32.522 --> 51:34.391
it's super busy, and yeah, I just need a minute.

51:34.391 --> 51:35.892
- I got this, go take a break.

51:35.892 --> 51:39.329
(lively music)

51:39.329 --> 51:41.298
- Aurora's next appointment isn't 'til three.

51:41.298 --> 51:43.433
- Here is where I will be.

51:45.435 --> 51:48.605
- Hello, welcome to Unique Nails.

51:48.605 --> 51:50.640
You have an appointment with us this morning?

51:50.640 --> 51:52.309
- Hello.

51:52.309 --> 51:53.710
The name is Mandy.

51:57.747 --> 51:59.616
- Yes, Mandy.

51:59.616 --> 52:02.886
You have the Deluxe Mani/Pedi with snacks and champagne.

52:02.886 --> 52:05.622
If you wanna follow me this way.

52:07.357 --> 52:09.159
Take a seat.

52:09.159 --> 52:12.596
Our chairs offer 20 different massage settings,

52:12.596 --> 52:15.398
and I'll be back with a hot towel

52:15.398 --> 52:17.634
for your legs and some champagne.

52:17.634 --> 52:20.504
Vivian here is gonna be working with you today.

52:20.504 --> 52:21.371
Enjoy.

52:25.742 --> 52:26.610
- Pull.

52:30.213 --> 52:30.881
Pull!

52:32.782 --> 52:35.652
Put your feet in the water, honey!

52:36.753 --> 52:38.255
(Mandy screaming)

52:38.255 --> 52:39.322
- Hot, hot!

52:39.322 --> 52:40.390
- No, no, no!

52:40.390 --> 52:41.391
Sorry, sorry!

52:41.391 --> 52:43.326
I make it colder!

52:43.326 --> 52:44.928
(Mandy screaming)

52:44.928 --> 52:48.498
I'm so sorry, but I make it colder.

52:48.498 --> 52:50.233
This water not burning you!

52:50.233 --> 52:51.234
- Yes it's hot!

52:51.234 --> 52:51.902
I say hot!

52:51.902 --> 52:52.903
- No!

52:52.903 --> 52:54.237
It's not even hot!

52:54.237 --> 52:55.372
- You pay me, or I pay you, huh?

52:55.372 --> 52:56.506
I wanna talk to a manager!

52:56.506 --> 52:57.841
I wanna talk to a manager!

52:57.841 --> 52:59.543
- Ladies, ladies, ladies,

52:59.543 --> 53:00.977
what seems to be the trouble here?

53:00.977 --> 53:03.713
- Your worker burn me, now she shouting at me!

53:03.713 --> 53:05.282
What kind of business you running?

53:05.282 --> 53:06.716
- Miss, please lower your voice.

53:06.716 --> 53:09.486
I assure you, this must be an accident.

53:09.486 --> 53:10.954
Vivian would never try to hurt

53:10.954 --> 53:12.956
one of our clients, right Vivian?

53:12.956 --> 53:15.292
- I do good nail.

53:15.292 --> 53:15.959
She crazy!

53:17.594 --> 53:19.529
- She called me crazy!

53:19.529 --> 53:21.665
- I will take care of this, we will make this up to you.

53:21.665 --> 53:23.433
I'll take care of everything.

53:23.433 --> 53:24.568
Kristen!

53:24.568 --> 53:26.469
- [Kristen] What's going on?

53:26.469 --> 53:28.238
- Pump her service, bring her another bottle of champagne.

53:28.238 --> 53:30.540
There was some little mishap with Vivian,

53:30.540 --> 53:32.742
I've gotta go talk to her.

53:32.742 --> 53:35.545
(dramatic music)

53:38.982 --> 53:42.485
- Well, here's a towel for our legs,

53:42.485 --> 53:43.920
and I brought you some champagne,

53:43.920 --> 53:45.455
I'll be right back with the flute.

53:45.455 --> 53:46.323
- Oh.

53:47.724 --> 53:49.459
And good one, Mandy.

53:52.696 --> 53:54.998
- Here's to the blossoming of your colorful heart.

53:54.998 --> 53:57.667
Let it become a visual work of art.

53:57.667 --> 54:00.036
- I've never seen anything like this.

54:00.036 --> 54:00.904
Thank you.

54:02.005 --> 54:03.807
- Same, same it's true,

54:03.807 --> 54:06.042
the only difference is I se the flower as you.

54:06.042 --> 54:06.910

We need to get this place looking fly.

(Mimi groaning)

54:20.557 --> 54:22.392
Let's get it.

54:22.392 --> 54:24.661
- Clean it just so people can mess it all up?

54:24.661 --> 54:26.563
- Mimi girl, we get to host a party.

54:26.563 --> 54:28.632
It's gonna be so legit!

54:28.632 --> 54:31.301
Let's just put on some music and get it started.

- Oh girl, let me get those for you.

54:46.549 --> 54:49.686
- How was your day off, new girl?

54:49.686 --> 54:52.756

54:55.792 --> 54:57.027
How was it here?

Oh, your manicure's so nice.

- Of course I did.

55:05.435 --> 55:07.904
(upbeat music)

55:12.676 --> 55:13.810
- Hello!

55:13.810 --> 55:15.645
Hi, my name is Latoya Smith,

55:15.645 --> 55:16.513
and I'm with the LA County Health Department.

55:16.513 --> 55:17.947
- [Mimi] Shit!

55:17.947 --> 55:19.349
- What can I do for you Mrs. Smith?

55:19.349 --> 55:20.784
- There's been a complaint filed.

55:20.784 --> 55:22.385
May I have a word with the owner?

55:22.385 --> 55:24.020
- She actually left, but I'd be happy

55:24.020 --> 55:26.056
to relay a message to her.

55:26.056 --> 55:27.791
- This here is a write up notice.

55:27.791 --> 55:29.693
There have been some concerns come our way.

55:29.693 --> 55:32.696
Public health concerns regarding dirty tools and fungus,

55:32.696 --> 55:34.798
just to name a few.

55:34.798 --> 55:35.932
Now, you guys have five days

55:35.932 --> 55:37.734
to get this place in ship shape.

55:37.734 --> 55:39.569
We will be stopping by as we deem necessary

55:39.569 --> 55:41.137
to make sure you're not sending people out into the world

55:41.137 --> 55:43.073
with funky fungus feet.

55:44.908 --> 55:46.943
Now you see, we've had a real problem around here,

55:46.943 --> 55:48.511
and it would be a shame to have

55:48.511 --> 55:50.547
another local business close down.

55:50.547 --> 55:51.748
Be done.

55:51.748 --> 55:53.383
Gone!

55:53.383 --> 55:55.118
Get it together, girls.

56:00.924 --> 56:03.593
(gentle music)

56:09.799 --> 56:10.667
- Okay.

56:16.606 --> 56:19.142
(phone buzzing)

56:27.851 --> 56:28.718
- Yeah?

56:30.754 --> 56:32.422
- Sam.

56:32.422 --> 56:33.156
It's Linda.

56:34.924 --> 56:36.559
- Linda?

56:36.559 --> 56:38.962
- Look, I know there's been some heat

56:38.962 --> 56:41.097
between us for many years,

56:42.165 --> 56:44.434
but I'm past it.

56:44.434 --> 56:48.805
I'm past the nonsense, and I just wanna be in the now.

56:50.140 --> 56:54.477
- Yeah, I really believe in the power of now.

56:54.477 --> 56:56.746
Live your best life.

56:56.746 --> 56:57.680
Just do it.

56:58.915 --> 56:59.916
Live it big.

57:01.985 --> 57:02.852
Purpose.

57:05.789 --> 57:08.591
- I know you had a really tough year,

57:08.591 --> 57:11.594
especially with the divorce and all.

57:12.962 --> 57:15.632
- Are you calling just to rub this in my face?

57:15.632 --> 57:18.001
Because I'm doing just fine.

57:18.001 --> 57:19.936
I don't need your pity.

57:21.471 --> 57:24.674
Oh, a little birdie told me that you

57:24.674 --> 57:28.778
had the Health Department pay you a little visit today.

57:28.778 --> 57:30.880
In some hot water?

57:30.880 --> 57:32.649
- Are you kidding me?

57:32.649 --> 57:34.484
What is wrong with you?

57:34.484 --> 57:37.120
Does this behavior really make you feel good?

57:37.120 --> 57:38.655
Fine, be a bitch.

57:39.589 --> 57:40.757
You're so good at it.

57:40.757 --> 57:41.891
- Really? Really?

57:41.891 --> 57:43.893
You wanna talk about the now?

57:43.893 --> 57:46.129
Okay, I'll talk about the now with you,

57:46.129 --> 57:48.164
this is what's happening now.

57:48.164 --> 57:49.032
Elite LA.

57:50.633 --> 57:53.002
You and your little crew are going down.

57:53.002 --> 57:56.506
And after that, your entire salon.

57:56.506 --> 57:57.707
Bye-bye for now.

57:57.707 --> 58:00.510
(dramatic music)

58:04.147 --> 58:06.583
- I guess some things will never change.

58:06.583 --> 58:07.951
Bring it, bitch!

58:07.951 --> 58:10.286
- I'm taking my life back now.

58:10.286 --> 58:13.089
(dramatic music)

58:13.990 --> 58:14.858
- Hey mom!

58:21.664 --> 58:22.532
Whoa.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.702
Everything okay?

58:25.702 --> 58:28.004
- I wish I could say yes,

58:28.004 --> 58:32.709
but this shit with Sam, it's draining my last nerve.

58:32.709 --> 58:34.644
First the salon, then the competition,

58:34.644 --> 58:36.880
and I know she called the Health Department on me.

58:36.880 --> 58:38.615
- What?

58:38.615 --> 58:39.749
Why would she?

58:41.684 --> 58:44.587
I knew she was an ass, but really?

58:44.587 --> 58:46.923
- This shit is draining me.

58:46.923 --> 58:49.092
I'm always trying to take the high road,

58:49.092 --> 58:51.961
but she's wearing me down.

58:51.961 --> 58:56.799
This stress is affecting my business, and the girls!

58:56.799 --> 58:58.801
- Look ma, I'm here.

58:58.801 --> 59:02.872
I got your back, and I know the girls do as well.

59:04.040 --> 59:04.908
- Son.

59:06.609 --> 59:08.711
I know you have a relationship with Sam's daughter.

59:08.711 --> 59:11.047
- I think that's run its course,

59:11.047 --> 59:12.949
especially after all this.

59:12.949 --> 59:17.954
How could I trust anyone involved with Sam at that level?

59:19.322 --> 59:22.225
I wanna focus on being there for you, mom.

59:22.225 --> 59:23.793
Really.

59:23.793 --> 59:26.863
- Thanks son, I really appreciate that.

59:29.999 --> 59:32.268
- Can't be drinking alone, let me refill this.

59:32.268 --> 59:35.004
(Ben chuckling)

59:37.073 --> 59:38.207

59:38.207 --> 59:39.876
- Tomorrow's the big day,

59:39.876 --> 59:41.811
and I am beyond stoked to be a part of this.

59:41.811 --> 59:44.213
Come down and witness all the magic for yourselves.

59:44.213 --> 59:48.351
I'll be dropping beats and posting Tweets.

59:48.351 --> 59:51.888
- Okay you guys, tomorrow is the big day.

59:53.256 --> 59:54.657
We have a chance to put our lovely

59:54.657 --> 59:56.659
new beauty bar on the map.

59:56.659 --> 59:59.395
The Elite LA featuring us as the top salon in town

59:59.395 --> 01:00:01.197
will change the game for all of us.

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:03.266
Not to mention the pretty penny we will win.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.734
- Penny?

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:07.270
I don't work for a penny.

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:09.706
- We've been practicing.

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:12.408
(David laughing)

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:15.712
- Kristen, ladies, how's it going?

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:18.214
- We're just getting pumped about the contest tomorrow.

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:22.018
- Wonderful, because losing is not an option.

01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:33.196

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:56.786

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:04.160
(suspenseful music)

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.428

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:13.870
Mom, are you getting ready?

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:14.737
Mom?

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:19.108
Mom!

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:20.109
Mom!

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:21.411
Holy shit, mom!

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:23.312
Mom, get up, mom!

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:24.447
Mom, wake up!

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:25.715
Wake up, mom!

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:28.217
Mom, wake up!

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:29.752
Mom!

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:30.420
Mom, come on!

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.454
Come on, mom!

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:33.289
Mom! (Sam groaning)

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:35.458
Yes, there it is, there's Sam!

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:36.893
Come on, mom!

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:39.495
(dramatic music)

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:44.934
- Can we stop and get coffee?

01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:46.069
I need coffee.

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:49.772
Don't you?

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:57.447
What?

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:01.851
- You know you're lucky I found you.

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:03.152
Passed out drunk.

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:07.090
And all that glass, just seriously Sam!

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.524
- (groaning) You sound just like your father

01:02:08.524 --> 01:02:10.793
when you call me Sam.

01:02:10.793 --> 01:02:13.463
Besides, I wasn't even that drunk.

01:02:14.997 --> 01:02:17.066
I slipped, hit my head, it was an accident.

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:18.267
- I called him.

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:22.171
Dad.

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:26.142
- Are you kidding?

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:28.211
- No mom, I'm not kidding.

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:29.846
Okay, the drinking, it's a thing.

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:32.281
It's sad and it's scary.

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:33.416
Okay, I don't think I can handle

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:34.984
finding you like that again.

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.552
- Oh great, just great,

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:39.489
one more thing for him to use against me.

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:43.025
The two of you are ganging up on me.

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:45.528
- Look, I have done nothing but support you

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:48.030
and put my life on hold to help you get back on track,

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:51.434
but you have to be willing to help yourself too, mom!

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:55.538
Okay, I want to see you happy, and healthy,

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:57.306
and able to move on from your struggles with dad.

01:02:57.306 --> 01:03:00.510
I mean, there's so much more out there!

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:08.184
Let's just get through this day, okay?

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:09.519
Win this contest,

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.890
and figure out a plan, okay?

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:16.225
- Can I have some coffee now?

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:19.462
- You know.

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:21.931
(Kristen groaning)

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:23.533
Coffee does sound good.

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:32.909
- Nothing beats good coffee in the morning,

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:34.377
does it sweetheart?

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:38.181
Don't you think?

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:40.917
(phone buzzing)

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:53.129
What is it, sweetheart?

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:55.865
- Ben just messaged me, he broke up with me

01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:57.333
thinking I had something to do with Linda's shop

01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.002
and the Health Department?

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:02.338
- That seems overly dramatic.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.074
Wait, wait.

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:08.010
Ben, Linda.

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:14.283
You've been seeing her son all this time?

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:16.085
Kristen, what the fuck?

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.486
(Kristen groaning)

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:19.488
- Listen mom, we met at school, okay?

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:21.057
And I really liked him.

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:21.924
Okay.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:24.894
I had plans to tell you,

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:27.363
but this whole thing just got so crazy just so fast.

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:29.232
I mean, it's obviously over with.

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:31.067
I don't even know what he means about the Health Department.

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:32.134
- You know what?

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:33.269
You're right.

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:34.437
Let's just focus on today.

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:36.639
Let's just get through today.

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:38.608
They're probably just messing with us,

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:41.277
and we've got a contest to win.

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:46.415
Right?

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:48.417
(giggling)

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:50.086
- Let's kick some butt.

01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:50.953
- Yes.

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:56.025
- Elite LA in the house, yo!

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:58.294
(crowd cheering)

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:00.963
We are here today to witness these lovely ladies

01:05:00.963 --> 01:05:03.566
going toe to toe, nail to nail,

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:06.435
to see which one has the skills to be named

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:09.705
the best manicure in Los Angeles!

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:12.441
(crowd cheering)

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:14.243
That's right, and the winning salon

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:17.213
will be featured in an upcoming issue of Best In LA,

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:20.616
as well as taking home a hefty cash prize!

01:05:22.218 --> 01:05:25.154
My name is Rogan, and I'm your esteemed host

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:26.656
for the evening, and I have help

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:29.025
from the lovely Miss Kelly Styles--

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:31.193
(crowd cheering)

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:33.262
And how can we forget about our esteemed

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.464
nail-savvy panel of judges!

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:37.533
(crowd cheering)

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:38.668
And of course, all of you,

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:40.169
so please show us some love!

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:43.539

All right, all right,

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:10.299
you think we should get this party started, or what?

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:13.636
(crowd cheering)

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:15.137
Okay.

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:17.039
These lovely contestants will be judged

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:20.543
based off of quality, creativity, and speed.

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:22.211
And of course, all of you out there

01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:24.246
can cheer them along for round number one.

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:25.781
And in the final two, we're gonna go head to head

01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:28.217
for that grand prize!

01:06:28.217 --> 01:06:31.053
(crowd cheering)

01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:34.357
Okay, here we go, the timer is set

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:36.492
and we are ready to rock and roll!

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:39.362
So technicians, on your marks, and

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:43.199
go!

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:46.068
(upbeat music)

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:49.071
(everyone cheering)

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.182
Time is ticking down here, and it looks like

01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:02.251
we're wrapping up round number one!

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:03.819
These ladies are not messing around,

01:07:03.819 --> 01:07:05.121
check this out, y'all!

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:08.457
(crowd cheering)

01:07:08.457 --> 01:07:10.359
All right, the judges look like they've made

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:13.162
a decision here, but we need you guys to help us vote.

01:07:13.162 --> 01:07:14.563
So who's it gonna be?

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:15.431
Is it gonna be this team right here?

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:17.400
(crowd cheering)

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.202
(crowd cheering)

01:07:22.471 --> 01:07:26.242
Okay, it looks like a decision has been made, so judges?

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:27.376
- You are out.

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:31.847
(crowd yelling and cheering)

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:43.292
- For this last round, remember that the ladies

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:45.461
will be judge based off of quality of skills,

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:48.164
creativity, and speed.

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:50.466
This is the lightning round, so you will have five minutes

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:52.334
on the clock to finish your manicures.

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:53.669
Okay, here we go.

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:57.273
This is for all the marbles, baby, are you ready?

01:07:57.273 --> 01:07:59.208
Who's gonna take home that prize?

01:07:59.208 --> 01:07:59.875
Yeah!

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:03.512
(crowd cheering)

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:06.515
(suspenseful music)

01:08:16.658 --> 01:08:17.693
Five!

01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:18.560
Four!

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.363
(crowd cheering)

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:24.265
One!

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.502
It is down, okay!

01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:31.640
It is now time for the judges to make that final decision!

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:34.343
- I'm sorry, you are so wrong here!

01:08:34.343 --> 01:08:35.344
I can't help it, I'm sorry.

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:36.812
- Are you kidding?

01:08:36.812 --> 01:08:37.680
This is absolutely the right choice.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.448
- Girls, girls!

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.716
It's really pretty simple.

01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:43.486
We know who has what it takes

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:45.921
for the market we're looking for.

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.555
- Ooh, it looks like there is some tensions

01:08:47.555 --> 01:08:49.925
going on right now between the judges.

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:53.562
- Talent is gonna speak for itself!

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:54.563
♪ Aphrodite

01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:57.633
(upbeat disco music)

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:02.203
- All right, it seems like a choice has been made,

01:09:02.203 --> 01:09:03.572
can I get a drum roll please?

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:06.308
(nails tapping)

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:15.518
And the winner.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:20.356
Is.

01:09:24.225 --> 01:09:26.629
(tense music)

01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:35.537
- Bullshit!

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.707
There is no way.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.408
You cheated!

01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:41.277
- Sam!

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:43.979
This has nothing to do with me.

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:45.915
We won fair and square.

01:09:46.948 --> 01:09:47.983
You need to stop it.

01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:49.984
- I demand we do a redo!

01:09:51.386 --> 01:09:53.856
- Have you lost your damn mind?

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:55.391
We won, you lost.

01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.862
- You cheated, Linda.

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:03.532
They cheated!

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:04.900
They cheated!

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.502
They cheated!

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:07.603
- Loser!

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:08.737
Loser!

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:12.408
(everyone yelling and arguing)

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.345
- Would you all just stop with this!

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:17.947
Everyone, calm down!

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:19.848
- What the hell are you doing here?

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:21.984
- Who you're telling to calm down?

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:25.988
- Sam, our daughter called me, and for good reason.

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:27.489
We're worried about you.

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:28.624
I came here to talk to you,

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:31.560
and I walk in on this madness.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.995
We're concerned about you.

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:35.264
- I'm just trying to do my own thing,

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:37.433
and take my life back.

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:39.835
- Honestly, I don't think anything's changed.

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:41.503
I don't know why you're always

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:42.905
gonna take things away from people,

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.773
instead of building something for yourself.

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:48.277
- I mean it's abusing, it's sad.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:51.814
I mean, I couldn't handle it anymore.

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:02.725
- Sam.

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:07.763
We used to be such good friends.

01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:13.435
But you couldn't handle us growing up and growing apart.

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:14.837
It really hurt me.

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:18.474
And you're hurting me now.

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:19.608
- Linda! - Mom.

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:21.977
You hurt me too.

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:26.348
It's time to stop depending on everyone else.

01:11:26.348 --> 01:11:28.817
It doesn't mean you have to do it alone.

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:32.888
We all support you and love you as an individual.

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:38.327
I just need my own life again.

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:38.994
- Okay.

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:41.096
Okay!

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:42.531
I'm sorry.

01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:44.533
I know I've been on this

01:11:45.868 --> 01:11:48.804
path of destruction most of my life,

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:52.074
but I don't wanna hurt anyone.

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:54.076
I just seem like I just.

It just seems like I can't stop

01:11:57.413 --> 01:12:00.082
hurting the people I love.

Maybe I don't know how to really love.

Mimi told me about your other job.

Real clever, but it's a conflict of interest.

01:13:40.215 --> 01:13:41.750
Really, I should have been paying more attention

about how much pressure you were under,
