00:10.080 --> 00:11.080
I found him.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.520
He's a Professor of Neurogenetics
at the University of London.

00:16.080 --> 00:19.720
Have you thought about what we're going
to do if we can't find him?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.560
We have to.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.520
You think he killed himself?

10:23.120 --> 10:24.600
How's it going?

10:26.280 --> 10:28.360
I'm pretty sure this constant measures

10:28.440 --> 10:31.640
the gravitational force
on the quantum scale.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.360
I think they understand quantum gravity.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.320
Who doesn't?

10:40.360 --> 10:44.040
It's only a small step from there
to manipulating space-time

10:44.120 --> 10:46.120
on the quantum level.

10:47.440 --> 10:51.520
I think they see matter
as a series of interacting waves.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.720
These equations predict the energy

10:54.800 --> 10:58.040
and direction of the forces
their interaction produces.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.480
There are videos
on the dead guy's phone.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.480
He was keeping a diary.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.560
He had his girlfriend here with him.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.440
Something happened to her.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.040
She left, or she was killed.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.080
Maybe that's why he killed himself?

22:58.520 --> 23:01.120
Look. I found a map.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.720
The university admin building's
off campus.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.640
It's not far.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.560
Maybe they have records that can tell us
what happened to the professor guy?

23:14.320 --> 23:16.280
It's worth a look.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.240
You going to eat something?

23:24.320 --> 23:25.600
Yeah.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.120
The ripples in space
we detected at the observatory.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.400
I think they were
caused by a quantum event.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.840
It must have been huge.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.920
What's the guy saying in the videos?

23:50.960 --> 23:52.280
He's just found Bob.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.480
Who's Bob?

23:55.600 --> 23:57.520
It's a nickname
I gave the alien creature.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.600
It was injured. He brought it back
here to work on it.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.080
Has he said what happened
to his girlfriend?

24:05.840 --> 24:07.000
Not yet.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.600
You can see he tries to not think
about her. It's too sad for him.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.560
You should watch the videos.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.480
Why would I do that? I have
more important things to do right now.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.160
I don't know.

24:23.520 --> 24:26.880
Maybe so you can take an interest
in others for once?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.280
Just an idea.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.520
Here it is, look!

30:55.360 --> 30:56.360
Professor Bill Ward, London.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.040
We found him...

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
What happened?

38:49.080 --> 38:50.920
-It was Bob.
-Oh, my God...

38:51.360 --> 38:53.880
I'm okay. He missed my artery.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.040
Dylan didn't kill himself.

38:57.320 --> 38:58.680
Bob killed him.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.440
Wait, I'll find some bandages...

39:03.360 --> 39:06.320
I watched the videos.
Dylan helped me solve it...

39:06.560 --> 39:07.840
What do you mean?

39:08.360 --> 39:11.600
If you follow the formulas and notes,
I think it's some sort of map,

39:11.680 --> 39:12.680
or pathway.

39:13.520 --> 39:14.760
To where?

39:15.200 --> 39:17.800
The alien who came to the observatory...

39:18.640 --> 39:22.160
he said their journey to Earth
took no time at all.

39:22.240 --> 39:26.240
It's not about where the pathway leads,
but when.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.480
I don't understand.

39:30.520 --> 39:33.280
They travelled back in time to get here.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.000
They travelled through time.

39:49.280 --> 39:51.400
You said you found him. The professor?

39:55.080 --> 39:57.840
Yes. He moved to another college
in London.

39:57.920 --> 39:59.760
It's at a different campus.

43:10.200 --> 43:13.160
You were right.
I should listen to people more.

43:15.680 --> 43:17.560
They make me feel stupid.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.920
You're the smartest person I know...?

43:22.200 --> 43:25.200
I'm smart at science.

43:27.400 --> 43:29.960
I find people hard to understand.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.800
You were always so popular.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.080
It was easy for you.

43:38.640 --> 43:42.880
I was jealous. I hid behind my books.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.680
I still hide now.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.960
I see you peeking out,
more than you used to.

44:02.920 --> 44:05.440
Did you find out
what happened to his girlfriend?

44:07.440 --> 44:09.120
You want to see?

46:28.800 --> 46:30.480
You okay?

46:33.480 --> 46:35.160
Yes.

46:36.400 --> 46:38.080
We should go find your professor.
