WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.360
"Nothing to do." "Nothing to do"?
"Nothing to do,"?!

00:05.360 --> 00:07.120
Mm. I mean...

00:07.120 --> 00:09.320
Thank you. There's tonnes to do!

00:09.320 --> 00:12.600
There's lovely little walks and
there's that nice pub down the road.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.880
That closed down.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.360
OK, well, there's still
that not-very-nice pub

00:16.360 --> 00:17.600
that's a long way away.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.520
OK, not lots to do, exactly,

00:19.520 --> 00:22.480
but, like, whatever happened to
the great outdoors?

00:22.480 --> 00:25.320
Climb a tree. Hug a tree. Visit...

00:25.320 --> 00:26.840
...a... tree.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.560
Sorry.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.800
I'm going on.
No, no, no, it's the, erm...

00:33.440 --> 00:35.240
There's too much milk,
if anything!

00:35.240 --> 00:37.080
It should be the colour
of a buff envelope.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.880
No, no, no, we've been through this.
It should be brick red, one lump.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.360
A slice of lemon and nothing more!

00:41.360 --> 00:43.240
Well, two lumps,
if you're on manoeuvres.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.880
Or a drop of something stronger,
if you get the right tea lady.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.000
God, I miss the Commons. No, look,
come along, it should be brick red.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.040
We've heard. You're just wrong.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.120
How dare you tell a soldier how to
make tea!

00:53.120 --> 00:55.480
I don't have to listen to this.
I'm from Yorkshire, mate!

00:55.480 --> 00:56.880
I'm practically made of tea!

00:56.880 --> 00:59.360
Well, my family imported
tea, and the correct way...

00:59.360 --> 01:00.920
Yorkshire...

01:00.920 --> 01:03.000
God!

01:03.000 --> 01:05.920
Do you lot ever think you maybe
spend a little bit too much time

01:05.920 --> 01:07.680
in each other's company?

01:07.680 --> 01:09.320
Well, we don't have much choice.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.880
Yes, you know what they say -
you can't choose your family.

01:11.880 --> 01:15.080
Or the people you're trapped with
for eternity in the afterlife.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.040
Do they say that?

01:17.040 --> 01:18.200
No, I said it.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.080
I've never heard anyone...

01:27.800 --> 01:31.320
Absolutely ridiculous,
telling me how to make my tea.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.520
I mean, I can't drink it,
but that's not the point.

01:35.480 --> 01:38.520
Ah!

01:38.520 --> 01:39.680
Ah!

01:41.000 --> 01:42.400
Mm.

01:43.760 --> 01:44.800
Good!

01:52.600 --> 01:54.680
Mornin'. Good morning.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.440
Attention, everyone!

02:02.360 --> 02:04.000
There's another ghost.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.720
I told you!

02:27.120 --> 02:28.680
Just up there, on the border.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.520
Ah, the old Asprey estate. Mm.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.200
I said ages ago
is dead guy over hedge!

02:34.200 --> 02:37.200
Yes, well, you say a lot of things,
Robin, and your imagination

02:37.200 --> 02:39.480
does have a tendency
to run away with you.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.240
The Queen's out there!

02:41.240 --> 02:43.200
Two horses are doing it.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.080
They are filming a Carry On!

02:45.080 --> 02:46.680
Is dead guy over the hedge!

02:47.680 --> 02:49.880
I know what I saw.
Come along.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.240
Where's the fire?

02:51.240 --> 02:54.040
Ah! There's another ghost, Alison.
Come and say hello!

02:54.040 --> 02:55.880
Yeah, leave that.
Repairs are for squares.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.200
I'm all right, thanks.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.400
No offence, but the last thing
I need is another ghost.

03:01.800 --> 03:02.880
Annabel!

03:02.880 --> 03:06.000
Or another neighbour.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.920
Ah! Isn't she marvellous?

03:08.920 --> 03:10.200
The quad bike, not you.

03:10.200 --> 03:13.000
Thank you.
I was hoping to catch you.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.600
A little bird - Mary from the shop -
tells me you've started a B&B.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.400
That's right, yeah, up at the
Gatehouse. Right.

03:20.400 --> 03:24.520
It's just that there may be
voices on the local council

03:24.520 --> 03:27.160
who will worry about... tone.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.560
What voices? Well, exactly!

03:29.560 --> 03:32.360
Saying things like,
"Brings down the area,"

03:32.360 --> 03:34.720
or, "Turning into Blackpool."

03:34.720 --> 03:37.160
We need the money,
so you can tell these "voices"

03:37.160 --> 03:38.560
that it's all very above board.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.400
It's very classy, in fact.
Five-star.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.760
Well, it will be.
We hope so, at some point.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.080
Well, that's what they all say.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.880
But before you know it,
there's a funfair, donkey rides

03:46.880 --> 03:49.360
and a real problem with prostitution.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.280
When did you last leave the area?

03:51.280 --> 03:52.760
All I'm saying is,

03:52.760 --> 03:57.360
is it really worth the risk for
the sake of a couple of quid?

03:57.360 --> 03:59.640
200 quid a night. Well, exactly.

03:59.640 --> 04:03.080
Pin money! 200?

04:03.080 --> 04:05.520
Well, there's something
to think about.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.400
Toodle-pip!

04:13.000 --> 04:14.640
"Nothing to do."
Can you believe that?

04:14.640 --> 04:17.080
Well, you are
a bit out in the sticks.

04:17.080 --> 04:20.320
Maybe you need to offer some
activities, like bungee jumping.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.360
Off what? The roof?
All right, then, archery.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.640
Ooh, yeah! That's a great...

04:24.640 --> 04:28.080
No. Actually, not archery.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.760
Well, wine tasting, then.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.920
Or baking. Or cookery!

04:32.920 --> 04:35.640
Not cookery. What is that?!

04:35.640 --> 04:37.760
Fridge bap.
You still eat fridge baps?

04:37.760 --> 04:39.840
Mm-hm. Mate, you're not 21 any more!

04:39.840 --> 04:41.880
You need to look after yourself.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.640
Ohhh!

04:43.640 --> 04:45.920
Open a health farm!

04:45.920 --> 04:47.680
A spa! A hotel!

04:47.680 --> 04:50.160
That's already the plan.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.000
Well, I don't know!
People need something to do.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.920
Doesn't need to be much.
Just a bit of fun. Hmm!

04:57.760 --> 05:00.040
When you die, can I have your decks?

05:00.040 --> 05:02.680
Exciting.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.320
Hello! Here we are, of course!

05:04.320 --> 05:07.120
No, simmer down, simmer down.
Simmer. Simmer.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.840
Simmer.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.720
Now, this is, erm...

05:12.120 --> 05:13.920
Sorry, I don't actually
know your name.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.240
Maddocks, sir.

05:15.240 --> 05:18.120
Maddocks! Maddocks... Maddocks?

05:18.120 --> 05:19.720
Ah, everyone, this is Maddocks.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.040
Maddocks, this is... everyone! Hello!

05:22.040 --> 05:24.400
How do, how do? Robin.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.920
Hey! And, erm, Maddocks
died by, erm...

05:27.920 --> 05:30.360
Sorry, I didn't actually
ask you anything, did I?

05:30.360 --> 05:32.680
Erm, I trod on a badger trap, sir.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.360
Ah! Oh! Oh. Oh, no.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.440
That's nasty. Yes, that's...
Oh, you can see the bone!

05:38.440 --> 05:40.240
Oh, aye, you can, yeah.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.120
Here! Do I detect an accent?

05:43.120 --> 05:45.960
Sheffield lad, sir. Give over!

05:45.960 --> 05:47.600
I'm from Huddersfield!

05:47.600 --> 05:49.520
Neighbouring... fields!

05:49.520 --> 05:52.840
Well, er, we still are, sir.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.920
He's funny! He's funny!

05:54.920 --> 05:57.840
In't you funny? Oh, if it
pleases you, sir.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.280
Aye, I come down this way
looking for work. Gamekeeper.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.960
Feared as much.
Working-class.

06:03.960 --> 06:07.200
Unless they're in a voting booth,
there's very little point.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.040
So you worked for the Aspreys?

06:09.040 --> 06:10.960
Uh-huh. I knew Lady Asprey.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.480
We played bridge together.

06:12.480 --> 06:15.000
Well, I played. She cheated. Mm.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.200
Erm...

06:17.200 --> 06:19.440
Anyway, I should probably...
Oh, no, no!

06:20.880 --> 06:22.320
Well, it's just, er...

06:23.480 --> 06:24.880
...I don't like to linger here.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.840
This is where it happened. The trap.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.240
Nine hours to bleed out.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.840
Two weeks to find the corpse.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.720
I had to watch meself being eaten.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.120
Slowly.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.720
By badgers.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.920
Well, all the more reason
to stay, then!

06:42.920 --> 06:45.440
New company, new memories.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.120
Perhaps, in time,

06:47.120 --> 06:50.440
this spot will remind you of us
instead of, erm...

06:50.440 --> 06:51.640
Being eaten by badgers?

06:51.640 --> 06:53.320
Yes.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.520
Well, you must stay.
You simply must!

06:56.520 --> 06:58.360
Oh, well, if I must, sir.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.720
Let's dispense with the formalities.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.360
Please, call me...

07:02.360 --> 07:05.160
Fun. Fun.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.680
Ooh, yeah.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.760
Ah, there you are. Are you... busy?
No, no. No.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.400
They've, erm, popped out
to meet someone.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.160
Right, so, we've got all of
this land and we've got guests

07:16.160 --> 07:18.240
who complain that
there's "nothing to do".

07:18.240 --> 07:20.440
So I was thinking...

07:22.320 --> 07:25.240
Mike, you've got to stop
obsessing over that one review.

07:25.240 --> 07:26.320
Well, it's not just that.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.680
We've got to compete with
other guest houses in the area.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.800
I mean, look at this one, right?
It's 12 miles away.

07:30.800 --> 07:34.000
It's got pool-pool,
table-table, tennis...

07:34.000 --> 07:36.080
Pool, pool table, table tennis.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.440
No-one using commas?

07:37.440 --> 07:39.840
Yeah, that would be really nice
if we had the money,

07:39.840 --> 07:42.120
but right now, all we can afford
is two Dan Browns

07:42.120 --> 07:44.280
and the board game of your choice.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.040
Board games.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.720
Oh! We could put the chess table...
That gets more use than you'd think.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.640
Hmm!

08:00.320 --> 08:02.400
It's a kind of a game.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.560
That was quick.
Yeah, not really my type.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.240
Besides, couldn't get
a word in edgeways.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.160
You know what they're like. Yeah!

08:17.160 --> 08:18.640
Yeah.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.240
Oh, Alison! Alison!

08:22.240 --> 08:24.400
Alison, Alison!
Let me introduce you.

08:24.400 --> 08:28.560
Now, Alison is alive,
but she can see dead people!

08:28.560 --> 08:31.040
Oh, congratulations, ma'am.

08:31.040 --> 08:34.280
Thank you...? I hope
they're not bothering you.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.960
You cheeky ha'porth!

08:37.960 --> 08:40.040
I think we should probably go, guys.

08:40.040 --> 08:41.760
Your friend's looking
a little bit tired.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.680
Kind of you to notice, ma'am.

08:43.680 --> 08:45.720
Erm, that's largely
down to blood loss, so...

08:45.720 --> 08:46.920
Mm.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.560
Oh!

08:49.560 --> 08:51.520
The purple bit's a tendon.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.120
And the grey bit's the tibia!

08:54.120 --> 08:56.520
Anyway, I think probably
we'll just get going.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.720
Come on. Come on, everyone.
You'll be back tomorrow, yes?

08:59.720 --> 09:02.560
Er, y-yes, ma'am. Yes, of course.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.760
Marvellous. See you tomorrow.
Have a lovely evening.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.560
Come on. Getting late. Ta-ra, love.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.520
All the best. Carry on, Maddocks.
Aye. Yes, sir.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.200
Actually, it is getting late.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.720
I wonder where our guests are.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.560
Hello?

09:15.560 --> 09:18.200
Hi, yeah, hi.
It's Alison from the Gatehouse.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.960
I was just wondering what time
you're planning to arrive, with...

09:20.960 --> 09:23.600
Oh, right, OK.
I'll come and check you in.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.400
Oh! Oh, right. How did you get in?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.280
My husband? But he's...

09:30.160 --> 09:31.920
What did he look like?

09:34.960 --> 09:36.360
Annabel!

09:36.360 --> 09:38.480
What the hell is this? It's a sign.

09:38.480 --> 09:41.160
Yes. My sign... that I found
at the top of your drive

09:41.160 --> 09:42.760
with this arrow nailed to it.

09:42.760 --> 09:46.160
Well, don't look at me!
It must have been local youths.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.280
I did warn you -
the area's going to pot.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.160
So you didn't steal my guests?

09:50.160 --> 09:52.000
Absolutely not!

09:52.000 --> 09:55.120
Although, come to think of it,
there was a couple

09:55.120 --> 09:58.200
who popped by earlier looking
for a room for the night.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.120
I put them up in the
old hunting lodge,

10:00.120 --> 10:01.720
out of the goodness of my heart.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.760
But they insisted on giving me £200.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.680
You said that was pin money.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.560
Well, it is,
but everybody needs pins.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.080
You are the most unscrupulous...

10:12.080 --> 10:13.480
Sh...

10:13.480 --> 10:15.120
I have guests!

10:16.920 --> 10:18.120
He did what?!

10:18.120 --> 10:20.240
He poached our guests.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.520
Delicious. And he doesn't even
need the money!

10:22.520 --> 10:24.000
Like, it's just a game to him,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.520
whereas we have to count
every single penny!

10:26.520 --> 10:29.680
Yeah. I'm not going to let him
get away with this.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.760
Yeah, I'm going to
fight fire with fire.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.360
Would that work? In what way?

10:34.360 --> 10:35.960
Julian, Julian, Julian, Julian.

10:35.960 --> 10:39.440
You were in politics. You must know
a few dirty tricks.

10:39.440 --> 10:43.080
I'm afraid I don't recall any
involvement in anything underhand

10:43.080 --> 10:45.400
whilst I was in office. What?

10:45.400 --> 10:47.720
Is what I tell the public inquiry!

10:50.240 --> 10:51.400
No, I'd be happy to help.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.880
I know every trick in the book.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.240
I wrote the book!

10:54.240 --> 10:55.440
What is this?

10:56.520 --> 10:59.760
Oh! It like chess, but it huge!

10:59.760 --> 11:02.240
Ah, Alison, we need this.
We need that.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.160
Mike, tell me you haven't
just bought giant chess.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.800
I haven't bought giant chess.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.840
I haven't!

11:08.840 --> 11:10.120
Come on, then.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.960
Step into my office.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.600
What have you got?

11:15.600 --> 11:18.240
What do you know about judo?

11:18.240 --> 11:21.600
That's your plan?
I fight Barclay?

11:21.600 --> 11:25.200
No, not actual judo. It's a tactic.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.760
Use your opponent's attack
against them.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.640
He's taken your sign.

11:29.640 --> 11:32.000
Well, I took it back.
No, no, no, no!

11:32.000 --> 11:35.280
If that's his move, let's use it.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.520
Let him keep the sign.

11:37.520 --> 11:40.080
In fact, how about we even...

11:40.080 --> 11:41.920
...spruce it up a little?

11:41.920 --> 11:46.040
Can we do that?! 'Course you can.
It's your sign.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.040
Ohhh! Ah!

12:09.080 --> 12:10.600
I can see some movement!

12:10.600 --> 12:14.360
Ohhh... Oh! Another early bird.

12:14.360 --> 12:17.040
Yes, and no sign of the worm,
so you can join the queue.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.000
Excuse me, sir, I was here first.
Balderdash, sir!

12:20.000 --> 12:21.640
No, balderdash to you, sir!

12:21.640 --> 12:25.000
Please... Please!

12:26.840 --> 12:30.360
Now, I've had this before
with our clubhouse.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.280
We had to share it with St John's,

12:32.280 --> 12:35.520
the Venture Scouts
and the Sea Beavers!

12:35.520 --> 12:38.440
And there's only one thing
that works.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.560
A rota.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.760
So, Lady Asprey wasn't averse
to a restorative tonic,

12:43.760 --> 12:45.920
if you get my meaning, Maddocks.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.720
Is that game?
Does that count as game?

12:47.720 --> 12:49.720
Well, anyway, it's a seagull,
and I shot it.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.520
Of course, on my side of
t'peaks, a ginnel's a snicket.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.200
And here's him calling it
a twitten? Give over!

12:55.200 --> 12:58.800
So, prawn can move two square
first go, but only vertical.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.200
Thomas? You're up.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.720
Yes!

13:06.680 --> 13:08.080
It's not without its problems.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.160
She's alive, I'm dead.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.080
But we make it work.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.880
And what's the brown stuff?

13:13.880 --> 13:15.920
Er, it's bone marrow.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.560
Ooh!

13:18.960 --> 13:21.040
I think he's got gangrene.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.920
Well, she called it a folly, but it
was little more than a shed.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.280
Just room enough for a bridge table
and a barrel of gin.

13:31.280 --> 13:34.120
It was just up here,
beyond the orangery.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.800
Hi.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.280
You're popular today.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.920
Oh, er, most attentive, ma'am.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.960
Yeah. I know they can be a lot,
but when you get to know them...

13:44.960 --> 13:47.080
Have you booked a slot? Erm...

13:47.080 --> 13:51.200
No! That's what I thought.
Honestly! No manners at all.

13:51.200 --> 13:55.040
Which reminds me of Lord Asprey
and that infernal pipe.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.560
Honestly! Lord Ashtray,
we used to call him.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.520
Ah. Very good, ma'am.

14:02.280 --> 14:06.080
Hey! Excuse me,
what do you think you're doing?

14:07.880 --> 14:09.480
Annabel!

14:09.480 --> 14:11.360
Stop!

14:11.360 --> 14:14.600
Managed to call in a few favours
down at the council.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.400
Thought I'd finally get
those potholes sorted.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.680
What potholes? Well, cracks, really.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.960
But if the frost gets in there,
better to nip it in the bud.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.320
They're completely
blocking our driveway.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.560
What?

14:28.560 --> 14:31.400
Oh, yes, I suppose they are, a bit.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.320
Oh, well, they'll only be
a few days.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.240
A week at the outside. A week?!

14:36.240 --> 14:39.400
Oh, yes, you probably have guests!

14:39.400 --> 14:43.440
Yes! Oh, well, there's always room
down at my place.

14:43.440 --> 14:46.440
You can't miss it.
There's a very handy sign.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.680
Barclay? I think you're a big...

14:59.680 --> 15:01.920
He did what?!

15:01.920 --> 15:05.840
Yeah. I just had to bribe two guys
not to fix a road. Oh!

15:05.840 --> 15:08.240
That's... brilliant!

15:08.240 --> 15:10.400
I mean... awful. You know.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.000
But in a way I really admire.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.200
So what are we going to do?

15:14.200 --> 15:16.400
Well, when he goes low...

15:16.400 --> 15:18.360
We go high. What?

15:18.360 --> 15:20.720
No? Oh. Oh, God, no.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.640
We go even lower. Erm...

15:22.640 --> 15:26.360
Ooh, hey, open up that CIA thing,
you know, the, erm...

15:26.360 --> 15:27.920
...road atlas from outer space?

15:27.920 --> 15:30.200
Erm... Oh, oh.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.680
That's it. Now, show me
Barclay's place.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.560
Erm...

15:36.560 --> 15:39.160
Yeah. Now... B-b-b-b-b...

15:42.400 --> 15:46.040
What are you doing? Looking for
anything that falls foul of...

15:46.040 --> 15:48.880
..planning... regulations.

15:48.880 --> 15:53.880
That type stays very rich
by being very, very tight,

15:53.880 --> 15:57.800
which means somewhere,
he's cut some corners.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.800
How do you know this? Because that's
what I would have done.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.040
Aha!

16:03.240 --> 16:09.320
Hello! Oh, Barclay,
you naughty, naughty boy!

16:13.880 --> 16:17.640
Ah! Yeah, I think that's for me.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.960
Just need you to sign for it.
Oh, sure.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.520
There you go, mate. Cheers.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.160
Ooh.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.360
Oh, yeah!

16:48.320 --> 16:49.720
Right!

16:51.360 --> 16:53.600
Money well spent!
Mike?

16:56.280 --> 16:58.000
Why is that...?

16:59.960 --> 17:01.720
What? No!

17:01.720 --> 17:03.680
Erm...

17:10.320 --> 17:11.880
Mike?

17:15.640 --> 17:17.760
Annabel?
Hello there!

17:17.760 --> 17:20.640
I've just had a visit
from Building Control.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.400
Building Control? Yes.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.320
Turned up unannounced, poking
in every nook and cranny.

17:25.320 --> 17:29.120
Said they'd had reports of
irregularity. Oh!

17:29.120 --> 17:30.560
Oh, dear!

17:30.560 --> 17:32.160
Maybe it was your guests.

17:32.160 --> 17:34.400
I mean, if you will just
let in people off the street...

17:34.400 --> 17:38.360
My guests had nothing to do with
this, as well you know!

17:46.240 --> 17:48.920
Well, I'm not sure
what you're implying, Barclay.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.720
Oh, don't give me that.
We both know that you...

17:51.720 --> 17:55.080
It's probably... What? No, it's
within permitted development!

17:55.080 --> 17:58.440
If it's two metres...
I've got to go.

17:58.440 --> 18:01.680
And... judo! Yes!

18:01.680 --> 18:04.640
Or whatever you say
when you win at judo.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.120
Come on.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.120
Oh!

18:16.080 --> 18:17.840
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.880
That'll do it.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.960
Whoa!

19:00.520 --> 19:02.320
Mike turn into giant mushroom!

19:02.320 --> 19:05.240
What I would say
is that if you can...

19:05.240 --> 19:06.960
Kitty, is your turn.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.760
I feel so alive!

19:08.760 --> 19:10.280
I haven't felt this alive since...

19:10.280 --> 19:11.840
Well, since I was alive.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.400
Ooh, there's more.
There's more, there's more.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.840
Hello, Planning Department?

19:15.840 --> 19:17.760
Yeah! Good one. You're funny.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.280
Ha, yes, very good. Lots of fun.

19:20.280 --> 19:23.760
Erm, I just wanted to apologise
for my earlier outburst.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.040
Oh! Erm...

19:27.160 --> 19:30.480
Yes, got myself in a bit of a stew
when those chaps turned up.

19:30.480 --> 19:32.440
Storm in a teacup, luckily.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.960
Just have to move a boiler vent,
and they'll be happy as Larry.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.560
Didn't even lose a day's business.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.600
Right, well...

19:39.600 --> 19:41.240
...that's good news. Yes!

19:41.240 --> 19:43.280
Bit of a relief,
because building regs

19:43.280 --> 19:45.880
can be an absolute minefield.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.720
So, yes...

19:47.720 --> 19:50.080
...could have been worse.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.720
Much, much worse.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.720
He's got nothing!

19:56.720 --> 19:58.520
What special bond?!

19:58.520 --> 20:00.160
Well, we talk about chess.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.680
Oh, yeah, as if Mads
is interested in...

20:02.680 --> 20:06.320
Oh! Mads, is it? Mads?

20:06.320 --> 20:09.160
Maybe when you get to know him
a little better,

20:09.160 --> 20:10.640
nicknames will naturally occur.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.440
I think you'll find
that I met him first.

20:12.440 --> 20:13.920
I met him before any of you.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.040
Nah. No good.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.120
Perfect!

20:48.120 --> 20:50.480
No, no. No, listen. Dib-dab,
dib-dab, dib-dab,

20:50.480 --> 20:51.960
dib-dab, dib-dab, dab-dib.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.000
Let's settle this once and for all.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.680
Follow me. We'll ask him.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.000
Do it again.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.000
It sounds like it's clapping!

21:11.320 --> 21:14.640
There's a very important
question that I need to ask you.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.600
Worse than the badgers!

21:19.600 --> 21:22.240
Oh, please be open, please be open.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.520
Come on.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.120
Oh! Yeah!

21:44.880 --> 21:47.120
I've got to get out of this.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.800
Erm...

21:48.800 --> 21:50.200
Oh!

21:58.600 --> 22:00.040
Hello! Obi!

22:00.040 --> 22:01.640
Obi, it's me. I need help.

22:01.640 --> 22:05.200
Can you hear me? Hello? Nooo!
Mike, are you OK?

22:05.200 --> 22:07.360
No! Mate?

22:08.640 --> 22:11.160
Oh, my arm! Your arm?!

22:12.720 --> 22:15.280
Oh, no! Are you having a...?

22:15.280 --> 22:17.400
I told you, it's the fridge baps!

22:17.400 --> 22:20.080
OK, mate, just stay calm.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.640
Just stay calm. Help is on the w...

22:22.640 --> 22:25.280
Oh, no!

22:25.280 --> 22:28.280
Obi! Obi, help!

22:30.200 --> 22:31.840
Missed a bit.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.200
You...

22:34.320 --> 22:35.520
What the...?

22:41.480 --> 22:43.240
That's enough!

22:43.240 --> 22:44.880
That's enough!

22:44.880 --> 22:48.040
Then answer the question,
damn your eyes! Yeah!

22:48.040 --> 22:49.840
Come on, who's your best friend...

22:49.840 --> 22:51.400
...mate?

22:51.400 --> 22:54.720
Well, if you really
want to know...

22:54.720 --> 22:56.920
Yes!

22:56.920 --> 22:58.400
...none of you.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.080
Hmm?

23:02.080 --> 23:05.800
Mike? When you get this, come to the
Gatehouse. Something's up.

23:08.680 --> 23:11.320
Excuse me, what are you...?
Annabel!

23:11.320 --> 23:12.680
Here we go.

23:12.680 --> 23:15.000
Let's see what you got.
There you are!

23:15.000 --> 23:17.040
I was just walking the dogs

23:17.040 --> 23:20.520
when I spotted something
rather concerning

23:20.520 --> 23:23.680
in the rubble pile
from your recent renovations.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.440
Hmph!

23:29.400 --> 23:31.400
Thought I'd better phone it in.

23:31.400 --> 23:34.360
You know, concerned local resident.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.440
Yep, it's asbestos all right. What?!

23:36.440 --> 23:38.440
Ohhh, he's good!

23:38.440 --> 23:40.760
You'll have to shut this place
down for the foreseeable,

23:40.760 --> 23:42.560
get it surveyed, cleared,
certified safe.

23:42.560 --> 23:43.880
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.200
That wasn't there before.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.240
It... He planted it!

23:47.240 --> 23:48.560
Annabel!

23:48.560 --> 23:49.680
Alison!

23:49.680 --> 23:53.840
That is a very serious accusation,
and I can assure you...

23:53.840 --> 23:56.360
Judo! Use his move against him.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.760
If he brought that asbestos here,
where did he get it from? Hmm?

23:59.760 --> 24:01.120
Ask him that. Go, go, go!

24:01.120 --> 24:03.920
...let alone a dear friend
and neighbour!

24:03.920 --> 24:06.560
Well... OK, I tell you what,

24:06.560 --> 24:09.000
why don't you search
the buildings on his estate

24:09.000 --> 24:11.680
and see if any of them are
missing a couple of roof tiles?

24:11.680 --> 24:14.680
Well, now...

24:14.680 --> 24:18.480
I-I-I-I think these good people
are busy enough without, erm...

24:18.480 --> 24:20.440
Because, Barclay,
that would be fly-tipping

24:20.440 --> 24:21.760
of a dangerous substance,

24:21.760 --> 24:24.520
which I think you'll find
is against the law!

24:24.520 --> 24:27.560
I think you will find that.

24:27.560 --> 24:33.160
Wow! Erm, actually, that-that does
look a bit familiar.

24:33.160 --> 24:35.800
No idea how it got here, but I'll
gladly pay for removal.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.280
Let's just forget all this. Yes.

24:38.280 --> 24:41.840
You know, er, I'm actually getting
out of the accommodation game,

24:41.840 --> 24:44.440
so no need to, erm...

24:44.440 --> 24:45.880
Bye!

24:51.120 --> 24:53.720
Mike Cooper? Yeah!

24:56.600 --> 24:58.160
I'm OK.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.920
What is going on?

24:59.920 --> 25:02.160
Oh, I don't know any more.

25:04.840 --> 25:09.280
I just find you all profoundly,
profoundly annoying.

25:09.280 --> 25:12.200
Why do you need
another friend? Hmm?

25:12.200 --> 25:16.520
I mean, look at you, stuck in that
house with each other all this time.

25:16.520 --> 25:19.920
And yet here you all are,
out here, together.

25:19.920 --> 25:23.160
How are you not sick
of the sight of each other?

25:23.160 --> 25:24.800
Well, we are.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.800
Give over!

25:26.800 --> 25:28.080
If I were any of you,

25:28.080 --> 25:31.400
I'd have been off living on me
own in the woods years ago.

25:31.400 --> 25:34.400
I mean, I dunno what you call it,
this, but, face it...

25:35.720 --> 25:37.320
...you'd all be lost without it.

25:40.280 --> 25:42.680
He might have a point, y'know. Yeah.

25:42.680 --> 25:46.360
Well, we may not be each
other's perfect cup of tea...

25:47.800 --> 25:50.200
...but when the chips
are down, we really have to...

25:50.200 --> 25:52.920
Oh! He... He go! Whoo!

25:52.920 --> 25:55.640
Huh? Where?

25:55.640 --> 25:57.520
Oh...

25:57.520 --> 25:59.880
He's gone to be
with the rest of his foot.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.560
And so it goes. Can't be helped.
What a shame.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.080
Now, er, what was I saying?

26:04.080 --> 26:06.040
Some old guff about
a perfect cup of tea.

26:10.040 --> 26:13.320
Oh, aye,
Little Miss Grumpy-Pants?

26:17.120 --> 26:18.440
Told you.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.200
Aye. They are a lot.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.760
Well... I'll see you Tuesday.

26:26.760 --> 26:29.320
Yeah, yeah, Tuesday. Tuesday, aye.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.080
And, dooka-dooka!

26:36.080 --> 26:37.840
Barclay had to learn the hard way

26:37.840 --> 26:40.800
that you cannot outplay
a grandmaster.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.760
Checkmate.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.280
Oh, damn and blast!

26:49.600 --> 26:53.200
Ready? Go, go, go.

26:53.200 --> 26:56.240
Oh, my God, we should have
bought these ages ago.

26:56.240 --> 26:59.000
Yeah. Wait, so, to get out of it,
do you just, like...?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.600
Erm...

27:00.600 --> 27:01.920
Oh, no. No, yeah, that happens.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.040
You've just got to be

27:03.040 --> 27:05.080
gentle with the cla...

27:05.080 --> 27:07.240
Oh, no.

27:07.240 --> 27:08.840
Oh, no.
