WEBVTT

00:01.853 --> 00:03.860
<i>No, your mom is
the monster, all right?</i>

00:03.893 --> 00:04.928
<i>My mom is the sweet one.</i>

00:05.435 --> 00:06.729
<i>Oh, the sweet one?</i>

00:06.762 --> 00:08.029
Are you kidding me? Uh, look,

00:08.064 --> 00:09.866
if anything, my mom's
aggravatingly sweet,

00:09.899 --> 00:11.702
but we're not having an argument
about who's sweeter, what...

00:11.735 --> 00:13.303
Whoa, whoa, hang on a second here, guys.

00:13.335 --> 00:14.303
What are you going on about?

00:14.337 --> 00:15.305
All right, look,

00:15.338 --> 00:16.540
my mom's been calling me,

00:16.573 --> 00:17.541
like, all the time, okay?

00:17.573 --> 00:19.076
She's clearly upset.

00:19.109 --> 00:20.410
Well, how would you know?
You don't even answer.

00:20.442 --> 00:22.812
My mom stopped calling me altogether.

00:22.845 --> 00:23.879
Your mom stopped calling you

00:23.912 --> 00:24.915
the day the phone was invented.

00:24.948 --> 00:26.216
My mom has a great relationship with me.

00:26.249 --> 00:27.551
- She never calls you!
- She calls me all the time!

00:27.583 --> 00:28.651
- Yes, she does!
- But I have proof, anyway.

00:28.685 --> 00:29.652
I have proof. Look at this.

00:29.686 --> 00:30.820
I got this in the mail.

00:30.854 --> 00:33.089
Is that, like, a ransom
note from Mac's mom?

00:33.122 --> 00:35.391
Huh? No. This... my mom sent this.

00:35.424 --> 00:38.061
Oh. Why would your mom write
a ransom note to herself?

00:38.094 --> 00:39.730
Oh, it's not a...
it's not a ransom note.

00:39.762 --> 00:41.231
This is just how she writes notes to me.

00:41.263 --> 00:42.665
That-that's like a bunch
of gibberish, Charlie.

00:42.698 --> 00:43.733
I don't know...

00:43.766 --> 00:45.334
Is that a hieroglyph of a dog?

00:45.368 --> 00:47.904
Yeah, that's the animal my
mom fears the most, right?

00:47.937 --> 00:50.340
She-she feels trapped
inside her own home.

00:50.372 --> 00:51.341
There is no way

00:51.374 --> 00:52.676
you could get that from this.

00:52.708 --> 00:54.076
Oh-oh, okay, guys, guys, guys.

00:54.109 --> 00:55.411
I think I have a pretty
simple solution here.

00:55.445 --> 00:56.747
You see, ever since I moved in

00:56.779 --> 00:58.582
with Mac, and Dee and Old Black Man,

00:58.615 --> 01:00.750
my surveillance system's
just lying around in storage.

01:00.783 --> 01:02.085
I got about a baker's dozen of cameras.

01:02.118 --> 01:03.353
They're just sitting there.

01:03.386 --> 01:04.921
I say we set them up in your mom's home

01:04.953 --> 01:06.523
and find out what's
really going on in there.

01:06.556 --> 01:08.592
- That could work. I mean, yeah.
- Great idea.

01:08.624 --> 01:09.793
- You don't think that's creepy?
- What?

01:09.826 --> 01:11.595
He's talking about spying on your moms.

01:11.627 --> 01:12.595
So what?

01:12.628 --> 01:14.931
You can't spy on unsuspecting women.

01:14.964 --> 01:16.266
That's horrible.

01:16.299 --> 01:18.368
Uh, they're not women. They're old.

01:18.401 --> 01:19.869
At a certain point a woman
goes from being a woman

01:19.902 --> 01:21.437
to just being an old person.

01:21.470 --> 01:23.273
- True.
- Well, what happens to a man?

01:23.306 --> 01:25.142
A man lives and then dies. Why
are we having this argument?

01:25.175 --> 01:26.810
- A man remains a man.
- Dennis, it's a great idea.

01:26.842 --> 01:28.779
Okay, and no one's gonna get hurt.

01:28.812 --> 01:30.780
It's not like they're gonna
get exploited in any way, right?

01:30.814 --> 01:32.683
No, no, no, exactly. I
think once we have a look

01:32.716 --> 01:34.651
at what's going on in there,
we might find the situation

01:34.684 --> 01:36.286
to be, uh, pretty comical.

01:59.405 --> 02:02.443
Oh, it's so nice of you to bring us

02:02.475 --> 02:04.733
all these lovely gifts, Charlie.

02:05.078 --> 02:07.548
The plant, the globe,

02:07.580 --> 02:08.548
and the little teddy bear.

02:08.582 --> 02:09.681
Oh, no, no, no, no, Mom.

02:09.715 --> 02:11.050
No, we aren't gonna
touch the gifts, right?

02:11.084 --> 02:12.620
Okay, we don't touch them.
We just, we look at them.

02:12.652 --> 02:15.221
- Okay.
- And they look back at you and they... Hands off.

02:15.255 --> 02:17.291
Mom, make sure you
don't water this plant.

02:17.323 --> 02:18.892
- Your mom's not gonna water the plants.
- Oh.

02:18.924 --> 02:20.193
She has a very nurturing
nature. She would...

02:20.227 --> 02:21.527
Oh, Mrs. Mac, are you
gonna water the plants?

02:23.896 --> 02:25.531
- See.
- Oh, Charlie.

02:25.565 --> 02:27.634
I'm so glad to see you.

02:27.668 --> 02:29.203
- Yeah, okay.
- I was worried that

02:29.235 --> 02:30.471
- you were dead.
- Why?

02:32.172 --> 02:34.541
Oh, my mom also thought I was dead,

02:34.573 --> 02:36.709
and she also loves me very much.

02:38.078 --> 02:39.313
No, I don't.

02:39.346 --> 02:40.981
Oh, she meant the first part.

02:41.013 --> 02:42.548
She meant the first part where I...

02:42.582 --> 02:44.550
because she can't imagine a
life without me, right, Mom?

02:44.584 --> 02:46.387
I don't give a shit.

02:46.419 --> 02:48.589
- See.
- I'll put you out

02:48.621 --> 02:50.323
of the misery of this conversation. Mom?

02:50.357 --> 02:51.324
Is there anything you want to tell me

02:51.358 --> 02:52.493
that's going on in the house?

02:52.525 --> 02:53.761
Anything that's bothering you?

02:53.793 --> 02:54.994
- Anything you want to talk about?
- Mom, is there anything

02:55.027 --> 02:56.162
- that's going on in the house
- What are you doing?

02:56.196 --> 02:57.965
that you want to talk
about that's bothering you

02:57.997 --> 02:59.667
- What are you doing?
- in the house or I'm asking my mom a simple question.

02:59.699 --> 03:01.334
You're asking her the exact
same question I just asked,

03:01.368 --> 03:02.402
- so what are you...
- Do you own all of the questions?

03:02.436 --> 03:03.771
Do you own that question?

03:03.804 --> 03:04.844
You're gonna steal my question.

03:04.844 --> 03:05.905
Ow!

03:05.938 --> 03:07.107
Mom, what happened?

03:07.139 --> 03:09.910
She poured hot soup on me!

03:09.942 --> 03:12.578
I was adjusting my undercarriage,

03:12.612 --> 03:14.681
and I accidentally spilled it.

03:14.715 --> 03:16.350
- She poured hot soup on her, dude.
- She was adjusting

03:16.382 --> 03:19.185
- her undercar... Wait a second.
- What...

03:19.219 --> 03:21.588
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

03:23.242 --> 03:25.358
We-we could also get some soup.

03:25.392 --> 03:27.990
No, the-the video. We can go back
and watch the video

03:27.990 --> 03:30.464
- and see what actually happened.
- Oh, we can watch and see... Yes.

03:34.201 --> 03:36.203
- ...complain about the soup.
- She's beating the shit out...

03:36.235 --> 03:39.106
Gentleman, welcome to your moms.

03:39.138 --> 03:41.708
Wow, man. This is a serious setup.

03:41.741 --> 03:44.043
Yeah, no, it's no joke. I
like how you moved the desk.

03:44.077 --> 03:45.104
- All right, uh, look,
- Yeah.

03:45.105 --> 03:46.305
there was an incident with some soup.

03:46.412 --> 03:48.548
And, uh, did you get anything?
'Cause I'd like to see

03:48.582 --> 03:50.717
if-if his mom poured
on my ma on purpose.

03:50.751 --> 03:51.952
Oh, she definitely did pour it.

03:51.984 --> 03:53.720
And she definitely did it on purpose.

03:53.753 --> 03:54.988
There you go. She's abusing my mom, man.

03:55.020 --> 03:56.989
It's clear as day, but
what's really interesting

03:57.023 --> 03:58.459
is what seems to be happening right here

03:58.492 --> 04:00.328
in the live feed.

04:06.166 --> 04:09.317
Oh. You want to sleep.

04:09.336 --> 04:12.139
Well, I'll sleep you.

04:15.399 --> 04:17.485
- Huh.
- Uh... what the hell, man?

04:17.519 --> 04:19.312
- That's your mom abusing my mom!
- Well... No, it's not!

04:19.346 --> 04:21.120
That's just one of those things,
you know,

04:21.120 --> 04:21.721
- like where...
- What thing?

04:21.814 --> 04:23.416
You know, where you're just
like, you're like, it's like

04:23.449 --> 04:25.519
a "Why, I oughta," but,
you know, it's no big deal.

04:25.552 --> 04:27.521
- Why, I oughta what?
- Why, I oughta bludgeon you

04:27.553 --> 04:29.655
with a hammer. But she's not
actually gonna do it, you know?

04:29.689 --> 04:31.658
It's like how Ralph Kramden on
<i>The Honeymooners</i> would always

04:31.690 --> 04:33.860
say, "Why, I oughta." He was
threatening to beat his wife.

04:33.894 --> 04:36.430
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah. You know? I mean, it's-it's funny

04:36.462 --> 04:38.249
- 'cause he's not actually gonna do it,
- That was funny. Yeah.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.399
even though the threat is always there.

04:39.434 --> 04:40.767
- Yeah, he might...
- Yeah, he might cave her face in,

04:40.800 --> 04:42.502
- but he won't. He won't. Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. But he's not gonna, you know?

04:42.536 --> 04:44.605
- That's...
- Yeah, b... Well, that's funny.

04:44.637 --> 04:46.507
But in this circumstance, it's
not funny because it's my mom!

04:46.540 --> 04:48.675
Right, right. Wait,
actually, you know what,

04:48.707 --> 04:50.844
we-we don't really know for
sure whether it's funny or not.

04:50.877 --> 04:52.167
You know, let-let me try something here.

04:52.168 --> 04:52.968
Let me just...

04:52.978 --> 04:55.242
You want to sleep.

04:55.382 --> 04:58.118
Well, I'll sleep you.

05:01.387 --> 05:04.056
Hmm. Well, what-what is that?

05:04.089 --> 05:06.526
Well, I don't know, you made
me think of, like, sitcoms,

05:06.560 --> 05:09.062
<i>The Honeymooners.</i> I just
thought, "This isn't very funny."

05:09.094 --> 05:11.364
But if I add a laugh
track, maybe, I don't know.

05:11.397 --> 05:13.199
But it's not a show.
This is their lives.

05:13.233 --> 05:15.569
Yeah, but it-it does kind
of lighten it up for me.

05:15.601 --> 05:17.329
Well, yeah, it did lighten it.
But I'm not saying it...

05:17.404 --> 05:19.305
Can... can you play it again
without the laugh track?

05:19.339 --> 05:20.241
Yeah, sure.

05:22.439 --> 05:24.877
Well, I'll sleep you.

05:28.180 --> 05:30.959
- See, that goes right back to super dark.
- It's a bummer without it, isn't it?

05:30.959 --> 05:31.884
- It's not funny, it's not funny.
- Yeah, no.

05:31.918 --> 05:33.987
Yeah, but let me...
let me just try it again

05:34.998 --> 05:36.222
with the, uh...

05:36.255 --> 05:38.456
You want to sleep.

05:39.024 --> 05:41.705
Well, I'll sleep you.

05:44.630 --> 05:46.599
- That's funny. That's funny!
- I mean... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:46.632 --> 05:48.901
It's weird, because the
situation really isn't funny,

05:48.935 --> 05:51.013
- and you add a laugh track...
- I know, but the laughing tells me that it's funny.

05:51.013 --> 05:52.047
They have timing, man.

05:52.048 --> 05:53.748
- They have timing, for sure. Yeah.
- That's great.

05:53.873 --> 05:56.576
I don't understand. Is this a
dark situation or a comical one?

05:56.610 --> 05:58.412
Well, we-we don't really know
yet, Mac. We don't know. But...

05:58.445 --> 06:00.346
I tell you what, why don't
we stick around back here

06:00.380 --> 06:02.348
for a little while. Let's watch
how this whole thing plays out.

06:02.382 --> 06:04.251
You know? I'll keep
sweetening the situation

06:04.283 --> 06:05.519
as it calls for it,

06:05.552 --> 06:07.455
and you might as well stick around.

06:12.324 --> 06:15.529
Did you just ash in my tapioca?

06:15.562 --> 06:17.588
Mm-hmm.

06:18.497 --> 06:21.368
- Yeah. All right, yeah. I like that.
- This is gold.

06:21.401 --> 06:22.803
- They got something, man. Like... Uh-huh.
- It's really working.

06:22.836 --> 06:24.437
I don't know what this is, but...

06:24.471 --> 06:26.540
- What's this?
- Oh, check it out. Mrs. Mac

06:26.572 --> 06:29.209
and Mrs. Kelly have a
classic comedic rivalry.

06:29.242 --> 06:30.611
I mean, they're going
at it like the greats.

06:30.644 --> 06:32.379
Like Abbott and Costello, Tom and Jerry.

06:32.411 --> 06:34.013
- It's amazing.
- Huh.

06:35.815 --> 06:38.121
Oh, sorry. Fly.

06:38.817 --> 06:40.486
Buzz off!

06:43.757 --> 06:45.626
All right, well, you know,
if you guys are looking

06:45.658 --> 06:47.461
for a comedy troupe that beats
the shit out of each other

06:47.493 --> 06:49.829
for laughs, there's nobody
better than the Three Stooges.

06:49.863 --> 06:51.565
Put me on the show.

06:51.598 --> 06:52.966
- Whoa.
- What show? It's not... it's not a show.

06:52.998 --> 06:54.300
- Yeah...
- We're just watching our moms

06:54.334 --> 06:55.569
to figure out what the situation is.

06:55.601 --> 06:56.803
Wh... I mean, it could be a show,

06:56.836 --> 06:57.804
but, I mean, you're right.

06:57.836 --> 06:59.005
It's-it's not a show.

06:59.038 --> 07:00.139
Yeah, well it certainly looks like

07:00.173 --> 07:01.307
you're trying to make a show,

07:01.341 --> 07:02.643
and I think it's a good idea,

07:02.675 --> 07:03.644
and I think you should put me in.

07:03.677 --> 07:05.145
- Why?
- Yeah.

07:05.178 --> 07:06.913
'Cause I'm so much
funnier than these two.

07:06.947 --> 07:08.916
Look at them, they're just
smashing each other with stuff.

07:08.949 --> 07:10.150
I could add a whole, like,

07:10.182 --> 07:11.317
physical comedy element, you know?

07:11.351 --> 07:12.351
Hey, I smell chips.

07:12.384 --> 07:13.820
What are we watching?

07:13.853 --> 07:15.187
We're not really watching anything, yet.

07:15.221 --> 07:16.490
Until Big Funny shows up.

07:16.522 --> 07:17.657
You'll see.

07:17.690 --> 07:19.993
Ooh.

07:20.026 --> 07:22.930
Mrs. Kelly looks hot on screen.

07:22.962 --> 07:24.597
Come on, man, knock that off.

07:24.630 --> 07:26.933
There's something about people on TV.

07:26.966 --> 07:28.668
Catch me up. W-what did I miss?

07:28.702 --> 07:29.870
Uh, well, the grunty one,

07:29.903 --> 07:31.538
physically abuses the shrill one.

07:31.570 --> 07:33.205
And the shrill one
psychologically abuses

07:33.238 --> 07:34.340
the grunty one.

07:34.373 --> 07:35.374
And it really plays.

07:35.408 --> 07:36.677
It's really funny,

07:36.709 --> 07:38.110
And, you know what, uh, actually,

07:38.144 --> 07:39.780
I-I'm gonna try something here, guys.

07:40.981 --> 07:43.050
You are a horrible woman,

07:43.082 --> 07:46.185
and I can't wait until
those cigarettes kill you.

07:46.219 --> 07:49.221
And I shall dance on your grave.

07:51.257 --> 07:53.894
Yeah.

07:53.927 --> 07:55.395
This is so great!

07:55.428 --> 07:57.297
And having those other people laugh

07:57.329 --> 07:58.966
tells me when I should laugh.

07:58.998 --> 08:00.066
- Good.
- Yeah.

08:00.099 --> 08:01.200
I love that.

08:01.233 --> 08:02.536
And the music that I added makes you

08:02.569 --> 08:04.037
- you know that it's light.
- Yeah.

08:04.070 --> 08:05.872
It's also helping me realize
that I think the situation's

08:05.904 --> 08:07.473
okay o-over there, you know?

08:07.507 --> 08:09.376
And-and, honestly, I'm
gonna ignore my mom's note,

08:09.408 --> 08:10.543
like I ignore her phone calls.

08:10.577 --> 08:11.644
I think we're good here.

08:11.678 --> 08:12.812
They have chemistry.

08:12.846 --> 08:14.381
And I really love

08:14.414 --> 08:16.216
how playful and fun my mom's coming off.

08:16.248 --> 08:17.584
- Well.
- Uh, no.

08:17.617 --> 08:18.372
- Yeah, no, no.
- Never.

08:18.385 --> 08:21.988
No, no. I actually find your
mom very off-putting.

08:22.021 --> 08:22.989
- Yeah.
- She's hard-hard on the eyes.

08:23.022 --> 08:23.990
Tough on the eyes.

08:24.023 --> 08:25.157
And you know what else?

08:25.190 --> 08:26.660
- Like, super one-note.
- Yeah.

08:26.693 --> 08:28.228
No! No, no, no, no.

08:28.261 --> 08:29.596
My mom's got lots of notes.

08:29.628 --> 08:30.930
She's a symphony.

08:30.964 --> 08:32.565
She's getting so many laughs.

08:32.597 --> 08:34.568
- She's pushing the...
- I'm concerned about longevity.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.001
I mean, she's getting laughs from us,

08:36.035 --> 08:38.405
now, sure, but, uh, I
think that we're gonna

08:38.438 --> 08:39.573
have a problem in the long run.

08:39.605 --> 08:41.073
You just don't understand the nuance

08:41.107 --> 08:42.241
- of her performance.
- I don't.

08:42.275 --> 08:43.342
Cut to a close-up.

08:43.376 --> 08:44.745
We need more close-ups.

08:46.945 --> 08:48.949
Mmm.

08:52.651 --> 08:55.287
And she's constantly looking directly

08:55.320 --> 08:56.522
into the camera somehow.

08:56.555 --> 08:58.591
- She's repulsive.
- She is repulsive.

08:58.624 --> 08:59.792
You know what? I'm gonna go over there

08:59.825 --> 09:01.194
and-and I'm gonna show you.

09:01.227 --> 09:02.462
Sh-she can pop, okay?

09:02.494 --> 09:04.196
She's gonna pop. You'll see.

09:04.229 --> 09:05.071
Uh-oh.

09:05.799 --> 09:07.534
- Hang on.
- What's up?

09:07.566 --> 09:08.969
My mom's trying to call me.

09:09.002 --> 09:10.469
Hmm. Oh, wait, wait,
wait, you know what?

09:10.502 --> 09:11.771
Don't pick up. Don't pick up.

09:11.805 --> 09:12.805
- Oh, no, I never would.
- Okay, good.

09:12.839 --> 09:13.873
But let's let that play out.

09:13.906 --> 09:16.108
Camera one.

09:16.142 --> 09:17.611
Oh, Charlie.

09:17.643 --> 09:19.478
Charlie, please pick up.

09:19.512 --> 09:21.481
One, two, three.

09:21.513 --> 09:24.116
Charlie, where are you?

09:24.150 --> 09:26.654
One, two, three.

09:27.753 --> 09:29.757
Oh.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.197
God, it's me, Bonnie.

09:37.229 --> 09:40.733
I'm so worried about my Charlie boy.

09:40.767 --> 09:44.137
Please don't have him
be in a ditch somewhere,

09:44.170 --> 09:47.240
or squished between two trains,

09:47.272 --> 09:49.575
and his body mangled,

09:49.608 --> 09:52.745
so if they move the trains,

09:52.778 --> 09:55.915
all his guts and bodily fluids

09:55.949 --> 09:58.484
and organs spill out.

09:58.517 --> 10:01.654
Please, God...

10:01.688 --> 10:03.090
don't have him die.

10:03.122 --> 10:04.491
Aw.

10:04.523 --> 10:07.660
I knew it.

10:07.694 --> 10:08.995
She's a star.

10:09.027 --> 10:10.663
- Huh.
- Charlie.

10:10.696 --> 10:12.031
This-this could be huge.

10:12.065 --> 10:13.333
- Yeah?
- I mean,

10:13.366 --> 10:14.601
I think this really could be a show,

10:14.633 --> 10:16.002
with your mom as the star, I mean,

10:16.035 --> 10:17.838
imagine what that would do for your mom.

10:17.871 --> 10:19.172
I mean, w-what do you think?

10:19.204 --> 10:20.372
Oh, shit.

10:20.406 --> 10:22.108
Well, now I'm thinking

10:22.142 --> 10:24.777
about my mom starring
in a show, and I like it.

10:24.810 --> 10:28.247
Um, now I'm thinking about minotaurs.

10:28.281 --> 10:30.784
Now I'm thinking about
a hoagie sandwich.

10:30.816 --> 10:33.185
Now I'm thinking about a glass
of water to go with the chips.

10:33.219 --> 10:34.353
How-how many of my
thoughts do you need?

10:34.387 --> 10:35.722
Do you want me to go on and on, or...

10:35.754 --> 10:38.157
No, that's... We're good.

10:41.700 --> 10:44.628
Mom, you know that I think
you are the most captivating

10:44.661 --> 10:46.131
and beautiful woman in
the world, don't you?

10:46.164 --> 10:47.766
- No.
- Oh!

10:47.799 --> 10:49.134
I got something for you.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.434
Sort of brighten you up a little bit.

10:50.468 --> 10:51.969
What the hell is that?

10:52.002 --> 10:52.970
Lipstick.

10:53.003 --> 10:53.971
"Heartbreaker."

10:54.005 --> 10:55.374
Just like you.

10:55.406 --> 10:56.708
I ain't wearing no lipstick.

10:56.741 --> 10:57.775
Come on, Mom.

10:57.809 --> 10:58.876
Be-be agreeable,

10:58.910 --> 11:00.178
which makes you rootable,

11:00.210 --> 11:01.379
which makes you likeable.

11:01.413 --> 11:02.614
(bleep) you!

11:02.646 --> 11:04.382
That's a joke.

11:04.415 --> 11:06.617
That's a joke, we will
beep that, I think.

11:06.650 --> 11:08.886
He will beep that, and
that'll be... funny.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.188
Uh, you know, let me just, uh,

11:10.221 --> 11:11.356
try and put some of this...

11:11.389 --> 11:12.557
Buzz off!

11:12.589 --> 11:14.291
That's good... buzz off.

11:14.324 --> 11:16.560
You know, that's like, uh, a call back,

11:16.593 --> 11:18.362
which could become a catchphrase.

11:18.396 --> 11:19.564
You should probably think of a few more

11:19.597 --> 11:21.199
so you're not just too one-note.

11:21.232 --> 11:22.701
What about, um,

11:22.733 --> 11:24.035
"I can't even."

11:24.069 --> 11:26.405
Or, "That went well."

11:26.438 --> 11:29.875
I'm gonna take a shit.

11:29.907 --> 11:31.542
That's not a good catchphrase.

11:31.575 --> 11:32.543
It is healthy, though.

11:32.577 --> 11:33.712
Oh...

11:33.745 --> 11:36.748
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

11:40.285 --> 11:41.486
What are you doing?

11:41.519 --> 11:43.755
Just the wacky neighbor, swinging by

11:43.788 --> 11:45.257
with the usual hijinks.

11:45.290 --> 11:47.925
Aga-aga-aga-agoo.

11:51.463 --> 11:53.598
I'm sorry.

11:53.631 --> 11:55.766
Do I hear someone upstairs?

11:55.800 --> 11:57.435
Oh, neighbor!

11:57.468 --> 11:59.737
Just swingin' by to say, "Hello."

11:59.771 --> 12:01.272
Will you look at that?

12:01.305 --> 12:03.675
I've got my dumb head
stuck in the banister.

12:03.708 --> 12:05.776
- Dee's a nightmare, dude.
- It's awful.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.612
You're not gonna try
and put a laugh in, or...

12:07.645 --> 12:08.780
Uh, nowhere to put it.

12:08.813 --> 12:09.948
Yeah, you can't tell where the jokes

12:09.981 --> 12:11.083
- are supposed to be.
- Exactly.

12:11.116 --> 12:12.617
Whoops. Okay.

12:12.650 --> 12:15.087
It's actually a little bit stuck... Mac?

12:15.345 --> 12:16.455
Mac, you want to come pull on me?

12:16.487 --> 12:18.290
Dee, I-I don't know what you're doing,

12:18.323 --> 12:20.058
because n-none of this is playing,

12:20.091 --> 12:21.760
and you're not funny at all and...

12:21.793 --> 12:22.961
Hey, you know what, Dee?

12:22.993 --> 12:24.228
From here, what you're doing

12:24.261 --> 12:25.963
actually is kind of funny.

12:25.997 --> 12:27.265
I wish we could get Mac out of there.

12:27.298 --> 12:28.183
- Oh, I know.
- Terrible.

12:28.183 --> 12:29.253
He's making me sick.

12:29.254 --> 12:30.054
- Yeah.
- Ugly.

12:31.835 --> 12:34.105
Mrs. Kelly, can you please help me out?

12:34.139 --> 12:36.308
Uh, my head is really stuck.

12:36.341 --> 12:38.944
Um, I don't do well with emergencies,

12:38.977 --> 12:40.946
and I have to answer the door.

12:43.014 --> 12:44.883
- Hi, Jack.
- Hi, Bonnie.

12:44.915 --> 12:46.484
Just stopping by to
pick up that hard drive

12:46.517 --> 12:48.786
I accidentally left
under the floorboards.

12:48.819 --> 12:50.454
- Oh, come on in.
- Okay.

12:50.487 --> 12:52.290
Man, what is Uncle Jack doing there?

12:52.323 --> 12:53.391
- He's awful.
- Yeah, so creepy.

12:53.424 --> 12:54.593
He's gonna ruin the show.

12:54.626 --> 12:56.093
Yeah, that creepy pedophile vibe

12:56.126 --> 12:57.795
he's got going on is
going to be a tough sell.

12:57.828 --> 12:59.164
You know, even in Europe.

12:59.197 --> 13:00.432
Uh, let me try something here.

13:01.866 --> 13:04.401
Let me take that jacket.

13:04.434 --> 13:06.170
Ooh!

13:06.203 --> 13:07.304
Thank you.

13:07.338 --> 13:08.405
Mm.

13:08.439 --> 13:09.841
Aw.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.510
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

13:12.755 --> 13:13.912
That's funny from over here.

13:13.944 --> 13:15.347
Yeah, yeah, just give
me a good push on...

13:15.380 --> 13:16.848
W-what are you doing? Hey,
w-w-what are you doing?

13:18.449 --> 13:20.318
What the hell was that, man?

13:20.351 --> 13:21.820
Wh-what, that fart?

13:21.852 --> 13:23.088
I'm just trying some new stuff.

13:23.121 --> 13:24.823
No, n-n-not
the fart, no.

13:24.856 --> 13:25.857
- The fart's good.
- Yeah, no, I'm talking

13:25.890 --> 13:27.359
about the-the sound
effects under my uncle.

13:27.391 --> 13:29.361
- What-what...?
- Well, uh...

13:29.394 --> 13:30.695
I'm trying to make him likeable

13:30.727 --> 13:32.197
by turning him into the romantic lead.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.330
Romantic lead?

13:33.363 --> 13:34.665
They're brother and sister.

13:34.699 --> 13:36.333
Yeah, the audience doesn't know that.

13:36.367 --> 13:37.434
Well, you know what? I want to see her

13:37.468 --> 13:38.602
bang somebody, but not him.

13:38.636 --> 13:40.005
Yeah. All right.

13:40.038 --> 13:41.206
What-what if you make him like a,

13:41.238 --> 13:42.840
like a spy or something, right?

13:42.873 --> 13:44.708
And he's looking for
his hard drive, right?

13:44.742 --> 13:46.711
Because spies are always
looking for hard drives.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.213
Or, or, or how about if you write in

13:48.246 --> 13:51.049
some scumbag stranger
comes in off the street,

13:51.082 --> 13:52.884
and goes to town on Bonnie.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.618
All right, look, I don't
want to over-write this thing.

13:54.651 --> 13:56.453
And-and all of a sudden you want
to turn it into a spy thriller?

13:56.487 --> 13:58.290
- Well...
- That's... I don't want to genre jump.

13:58.323 --> 14:00.225
Let-Let's just see how the
romantic lead thing plays out

14:00.257 --> 14:01.458
- for a minute here.
- All right.

14:01.492 --> 14:02.861
- All right.
- All right?

14:04.594 --> 14:05.297
Oh!

14:05.971 --> 14:06.864
Ow!

14:17.775 --> 14:19.410
Yeah?

14:19.444 --> 14:21.078
What... what do you guys think?

14:21.112 --> 14:23.048
I mean, um, obviously, the
audio is temp, you know.

14:23.080 --> 14:24.815
But we could keep my
singing voice if you like it.

14:24.848 --> 14:27.819
- I like it.
- I like it, and it feels like a real show,

14:27.852 --> 14:30.422
and I love all the letters
flying around on the screen.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.424
- Those are interesting.
- Those are names,

14:32.457 --> 14:34.726
- uh, 'cause it's a credit sequence, which is...
- Okay.

14:34.758 --> 14:36.560
pretty good, but-but why isn't
my mom in the credit sequence?

14:36.593 --> 14:38.396
'Cause I feel like she was popping.

14:38.429 --> 14:40.265
You're lucky your mom's in
the credit sequence at all.

14:40.298 --> 14:42.167
Because I'm writing her
off. She's terrible. Let's...

14:42.199 --> 14:43.767
- Yeah, the word thing you did was good.
- Yeah, it was good, right?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.402
I mean, we got to get
somebody younger in there,

14:45.435 --> 14:47.004
- somebody hipper, somebody who's more fun.
- Yeah.

14:47.038 --> 14:48.773
- You know, preferably somebody of color.
- Okay.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.407
What are you talking about?
You can't kick my mom out.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.109
She lives in the goddamn house.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.777
Well, I'm gonna cut around her, then.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.946
- Yeah, we're gonna...
- Until the ethnic comes, and then

14:55.979 --> 14:57.915
- we're gonna need your mom's room.
- We're gonna get an ethnic.

14:57.949 --> 14:59.516
- You can't get rid of my mom!
- I'm getting rid of her.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.118
- I'm going to cut around her.
- Mac,

15:01.151 --> 15:02.520
- she's out, she's out.
- I'm gonna...

15:02.553 --> 15:04.022
This is... He thinks she pops.

15:04.054 --> 15:05.423
- She's terrible.
- Yeah.

15:06.602 --> 15:07.858
Oh, Mrs. Kelly, Mrs. Kelly.

15:07.891 --> 15:09.861
- Mrs. Kelly, hold on. Just give me one second.
- Ooh! One, two, three.

15:09.894 --> 15:11.529
- One, two three.
- What? What?

15:11.561 --> 15:15.432
- One, two, three.
- Oh, my God, what?

15:16.117 --> 15:16.968
Hi, Frank.

15:17.001 --> 15:18.535
What are you doing here?

15:18.569 --> 15:19.771
I came to see you.

15:19.804 --> 15:21.206
- Oh!
- Frank, is that you? Hey,

15:21.238 --> 15:22.607
come help me out, I'm stuck.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.975
Not now, Deandra.

15:25.242 --> 15:26.645
Oh, by the way,

15:26.678 --> 15:28.813
none of the stuff
you're doing is playing.

15:28.846 --> 15:30.315
Except for the fart stuff.

15:30.348 --> 15:32.483
What fart stuff?

15:32.516 --> 15:35.819
See? You should have
farted after you said that.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.122
Just come help me get out of this thing.

15:37.155 --> 15:38.790
- Put a fart in, Dennis.
- What?

15:40.857 --> 15:42.960
Oh, goddamn it, what's
Frank doing over there?

15:42.993 --> 15:45.296
I... You know what, I think
he's playing the scumbag

15:45.329 --> 15:47.631
who comes in off the
street to bang your mom.

15:47.665 --> 15:50.235
Well, I don't want him
banging my mom, dude. Shit.

15:52.270 --> 15:54.472
Oh! Uh, hi, Frank.

15:54.505 --> 15:57.008
I didn't know, uh, Bonnie was

15:57.040 --> 15:59.310
gonna be having company. I
would have put my hands on.

15:59.343 --> 16:00.911
How embarrassing.

16:00.944 --> 16:02.980
Get lost. I'm gonna bang your sister.

16:03.014 --> 16:04.416
You got it.

16:04.449 --> 16:05.617
Goddamn it, dude,

16:05.650 --> 16:07.319
This is gross. I-I don't want this.

16:07.352 --> 16:09.187
Can we turn this into
something else? I mean...

16:09.219 --> 16:11.189
Well, maybe... You know what,
maybe we could turn this into,

16:11.222 --> 16:13.024
like, a love triangle thing

16:13.056 --> 16:14.758
between Jack, your mom and Frank?

16:14.791 --> 16:16.761
No, I don't want a
love triangle between...

16:16.794 --> 16:18.429
- Well...
- I don't want any shape of love between them.

16:18.463 --> 16:19.597
That's just gross.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.665
Ooh!

16:21.699 --> 16:24.335
I'll be in the upstairs attic

16:24.368 --> 16:26.537
rooting around if anyone needs me.

16:26.570 --> 16:28.706
- Yeah, I do. I need you.
- Oh, I'll be up there, Dee.

16:28.740 --> 16:30.041
- U-Uncle Jack...
- Come on, Bonnie. This boner

16:30.074 --> 16:31.709
- ain't gonna last forever.
- Okay.

16:34.087 --> 16:35.337
Yeah. Goddamn it, though,

16:35.338 --> 16:36.638
- he's really gonna bang her?
- Yeah.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.382
Did Mac put a camera in my mom's room?

16:38.415 --> 16:40.051
No, I did.

16:42.719 --> 16:44.521
Listen, people... it does not matter

16:44.555 --> 16:46.358
how you people try to ruin this thing.

16:46.390 --> 16:48.926
I will make it work,
because I'm a genius.

16:50.912 --> 16:52.670
<i>Now look at the... plant!</i>

16:53.014 --> 16:54.049
Look at the plant.

16:54.162 --> 16:57.499
Now look at the globe.
Up. Back to the plant.

16:57.533 --> 17:00.069
Can't cut around her when she's
in every shot, can you, Dennis?

17:00.102 --> 17:02.405
- And look at the teddy bear. And the plant.
- Great.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.674
This disgusting bitch is in every shot?

17:04.707 --> 17:06.508
I don't want to stand here no more.

17:06.540 --> 17:08.175
I got to take another dump.

17:08.210 --> 17:11.012
Oh, look, Mom, no more
shitting, all right?

17:11.046 --> 17:13.648
Um... and when you go, are you
not having a full elimination?

17:13.681 --> 17:15.351
I mean, why are you going so much?

17:16.041 --> 17:17.353
Mom?

17:17.385 --> 17:19.154
Mom, where are you?

17:19.188 --> 17:20.489
Don't try and steal focus, Charlie.

17:20.521 --> 17:23.090
- Charlie, can't breathe.
- What? What?

17:23.124 --> 17:24.527
Help. Help, Charlie.

17:24.559 --> 17:25.929
Get off me, you crazy bitch!

17:27.363 --> 17:29.265
Mom, look, no more shitting!

17:29.297 --> 17:31.032
- Let's go, we got to go where the action is.
- Oh!

17:31.066 --> 17:33.169
Mom! Frank!

17:33.201 --> 17:34.703
Come on, stop banging!

17:34.737 --> 17:36.272
Charlie. What a pleasant surprise.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.541
Get off me, man. Get off!

17:38.574 --> 17:41.443
- Mom stays in the picture.
- Let's go, come on!

17:41.477 --> 17:44.380
- Charlie! I only got to third!
- Come on, get out of here.

17:44.412 --> 17:47.216
Go. You can have any woman you
want... it's got to be my mom?

17:47.249 --> 17:48.616
Hey, come on, what are you doing?

17:48.650 --> 17:49.884
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, Mom,

17:49.918 --> 17:51.787
we got to go where
the action is. Come on.

17:51.819 --> 17:53.221
God... Goddamn it!

17:53.255 --> 17:55.891
I was sliding into home, Charlie.

17:55.923 --> 17:57.278
- Get out of here, Frank.
- Aw, come on.

17:57.278 --> 17:58.992
Son of a bitch. Get lost!

17:58.993 --> 18:00.593
- Charlie!
- Aw...

18:00.662 --> 18:02.364
I can't breathe. You
guys, I'm pretty sure

18:02.397 --> 18:04.032
I'm gonna die in this banister.

18:04.066 --> 18:06.802
Charlie, what's going on?

18:06.835 --> 18:09.572
Look, I'm coming clean. We've
been watching you guys, right?

18:09.605 --> 18:12.741
The presents that we brought
over... they're hidden cameras.

18:12.775 --> 18:15.044
The teddy bear, the
globe... all that shit.

18:15.076 --> 18:16.711
I don't know how you
didn't see it. And then we

18:16.745 --> 18:18.381
turned it into a show.
The show was pretty good.

18:18.413 --> 18:20.081
We had chips. But look...
this all started 'cause you

18:20.114 --> 18:22.384
sent me this in the
mail. I got freaked out.

18:22.418 --> 18:24.987
Well, I sent it to you
because I missed you,

18:25.019 --> 18:26.576
I wanted to see more of you.

18:27.538 --> 18:29.224
That's all that is? It's not
because you feel trapped

18:29.258 --> 18:30.925
in your own home and you
guys are fighting too much

18:30.959 --> 18:32.228
or whatever it is?

18:32.260 --> 18:34.997
No. We get along great.

18:36.632 --> 18:39.067
Oh, but this makes me
feel so much better.

18:39.101 --> 18:41.437
Now that I know that you're watching me.

18:43.037 --> 18:44.606
My mom feels the same way.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.609
And she also says that she loves me

18:46.642 --> 18:49.077
- and misses me.
- Well, shoot,

18:49.111 --> 18:50.278
all right, well, why
don't we bring it on in

18:50.312 --> 18:51.781
- for a hug, huh?
- Okay!

18:51.814 --> 18:54.682
This was all just one
big misunderstanding.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.286
Get off me, dude. Get off.
What are you doing? Get off.

19:11.834 --> 19:15.104
I got to say it: that's the
best episode yet. That is!

19:15.136 --> 19:16.998
- It's a classic!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I love the button at the ending.

19:17.072 --> 19:19.308
- Yeah?
- Oh, that was the biggest joke

19:19.341 --> 19:21.043
- in the show. The biggest moment.
- It was, it was. - Was it?

19:21.076 --> 19:23.645
- I mean it, really.
- Oh, well, guys, look, I told you...

19:23.679 --> 19:26.047
- I know my physical comedy.
- Yeah.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.817
- Right?
- Okay, yeah.

19:27.849 --> 19:29.117
- Oh! - Oh! -
What are you doing?

19:29.151 --> 19:30.318
- What's wrong?
- Hey.

19:30.352 --> 19:32.121
Show's been canceled, guys.

19:32.153 --> 19:33.455
- What?!
- Wha...

19:33.489 --> 19:35.458
I got a four-episode sex arc.

19:35.490 --> 19:37.292
Nah, nah. You know,
now-now that everybody knows

19:37.326 --> 19:40.296
they're being filmed, it's
more like a reality TV show,

19:40.328 --> 19:42.630
and I just can't enjoy it when
the people who are being filmed

19:42.663 --> 19:44.165
- know they're being filmed.
- Yeah, but what about

19:44.199 --> 19:46.235
our show, man? What about
making my mom famous?

19:46.268 --> 19:47.903
- It's just not funny anymore.
- Oh, oh,

19:47.935 --> 19:49.591
oh, oh... I know how to make it funny.

19:51.448 --> 19:52.241
Oh!

19:52.412 --> 19:53.843
- What?
- Oh, I...

19:53.875 --> 19:55.009
I just shit my pants.

19:55.043 --> 19:56.846
- Oh, God!
- Oh! - Oh, God.

19:56.878 --> 19:58.079
- Oh!
- Oh, God.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.481
- Oh, Dee.
- That's not funny.

19:59.515 --> 20:01.016
I just meant to fart. I didn't...

20:01.048 --> 20:02.750
- I didn't...
- Oh, my God! Without the laugh track

20:02.784 --> 20:04.820
- that's, like, really horrible.
- Yeah, you're just

20:04.853 --> 20:06.355
a grown woman who shit her pants.

20:12.193 --> 20:14.029
Now it's funny again.
