WEBVTT

00:10.333 --> 00:12.250
Bless us, oh, Lord,
for these thy gifts

00:12.333 --> 00:14.625
which we are about to receive
through thy bounty,

00:14.709 --> 00:16.000
through Christ our Lord.

00:16.083 --> 00:17.583
Amen.

00:17.667 --> 00:19.125
ALL:
Amen.

00:24.166 --> 00:25.667
Did you buy film, Mitchell?

00:25.750 --> 00:26.792
Yeah.

00:26.875 --> 00:28.750
We'll want lots
of pictures

00:28.834 --> 00:30.000
of Ryan tonight.

00:30.083 --> 00:31.250
RYAN:
Okay, Mom.

00:31.333 --> 00:33.125
WOMAN:
Did you see your brother
in his suit?

00:33.208 --> 00:34.750
Yeah, he looks so handsome.

00:34.834 --> 00:35.917
Shut up.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.250
chuckling

00:37.333 --> 00:38.667
GIRL:
Are you taking me to Cindy's?

00:38.750 --> 00:39.834
I assume

00:39.917 --> 00:42.208
you're taking Ryan?

00:43.834 --> 00:45.000
WOMAN:
And no one misses

00:45.083 --> 00:47.041
church in the morning.

00:49.750 --> 01:09.625
'80s music playing

01:47.792 --> 01:51.834
WOMAN:
<i>Mitchell.</i>

01:51.917 --> 01:56.125
Mitchell? Mitchell?

01:57.959 --> 01:59.750
Mitchell?

02:00.917 --> 02:02.792
Mitchell?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.125
Mitchell?

02:10.417 --> 02:11.625
She ask for Homicide?

02:11.709 --> 02:13.041
She can't ask for nothing.

02:13.125 --> 02:14.208
She's loony tunes.

02:14.291 --> 02:15.750
Carrying around an obit
of a guy

02:15.834 --> 02:17.041
that died in 1990.

02:17.125 --> 02:18.291
Covering my ass...

02:18.375 --> 02:19.542
I called you.

02:19.625 --> 02:20.750
Why's she locked up?

02:20.834 --> 02:22.792
She kept wandering away.

02:25.041 --> 02:27.875
Come on, Silvan,
get her out of there.

02:27.959 --> 02:29.208
Son's on the way.

02:29.291 --> 02:32.083
She had his number
in her pocket.

02:35.834 --> 02:37.333
Hi, ma'am.

02:40.458 --> 02:41.875
So many cuts.

02:41.959 --> 02:45.208
So many cuts.

02:45.291 --> 02:48.041
So... so many cuts.

02:48.125 --> 02:49.625
You want to come out?

02:50.583 --> 02:52.875
Poor... poor Mitch...

02:52.959 --> 02:55.583
Poor Mitch... Mitch...

02:55.667 --> 02:56.792
Who's Mitch?

02:56.875 --> 02:59.250
Couldn't have a church
funeral...

02:59.333 --> 03:01.750
not with all those cuts.

03:01.834 --> 03:03.208
SILVAN:
Nuttier than a
fruitcake.

03:03.291 --> 03:05.750
Mitch was a good man.

03:05.834 --> 03:06.917
Was Mitch your husband?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.667
"Mitchell Bayes
served as
organist

03:08.750 --> 03:10.083
"and musical director of

03:10.166 --> 03:13.625
St. Anthony's Episcopal
Church in Roxborough..."

03:13.709 --> 03:15.083
SILVAN:
Here's the
son.

03:15.917 --> 03:17.083
Mom, you can't do this.

03:17.166 --> 03:18.625
You can't leave the house.

03:18.709 --> 03:20.333
SILVAN
I don't think anyone's
pressing charges,

03:20.417 --> 03:23.208
but she disturbed the peace
over at Holy Field Cemetery.

03:23.291 --> 03:26.500
RYAN:
I'm sorry. I'll
keep
a better eye

03:28.458 --> 03:30.458
That where your dad was buried?

03:30.542 --> 03:32.125
Yeah.

03:32.208 --> 03:36.125
It's okay. It's okay.

03:36.208 --> 03:37.291
mumbling

03:37.375 --> 03:39.583
She was
talking
about him.

03:41.041 --> 03:43.083
He was murdered?

03:43.166 --> 03:44.834
13 years ago.

03:44.917 --> 03:47.166
She's been going
back there a lot lately.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.792
Doctor says it's something
about older memories

03:49.875 --> 03:51.291
becoming more present.

03:52.709 --> 03:54.000
It's Alzheimer's?

03:54.083 --> 03:57.583
Might want to get her
one
of those bracelets.

03:57.667 --> 04:00.500
I ordered one.

04:00.583 --> 04:02.625
She was carrying these.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.750
We ever get the guy?

04:04.834 --> 04:06.542
No.

04:06.625 --> 04:09.291
Come on, Mom.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.667
Come on. Let's go.

04:12.750 --> 04:16.458
It's okay. It's okay.

04:16.542 --> 04:20.208
Yeah, it's okay.

04:55.667 --> 04:58.709
That's the civilian workers
going the extra mile.

04:58.792 --> 05:00.041
So how'd this guy die?

05:00.125 --> 05:01.917
Stabbed by a hooker
was the theory.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.500
Here it is. Bayes, '90.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.583
Why are we looking at this?

05:11.667 --> 05:13.208
The lady was
so
distressed.

05:13.291 --> 05:15.375
I just
wondered
why we didn't

05:15.458 --> 05:16.875
bring the job in.

05:16.959 --> 05:18.333
Mitch Bayes, 49.

05:18.417 --> 05:19.709
Stabbed 14 times.

05:19.792 --> 05:20.875
Wallet was gone.

05:20.959 --> 05:22.333
Presumed robbery-homicide.

05:22.417 --> 05:24.041
Never found a weapon?

05:24.125 --> 05:26.542
No, they never even
named a good suspect.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.208
Bump in the night.

05:29.709 --> 05:31.542
Let's take this upstairs.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.083
So is this
a regular thing now?

05:35.166 --> 05:36.250
Working cold jobs?

05:36.333 --> 05:39.041
I am. You can stay
on the line if you
want.

05:39.125 --> 05:42.542
I guess cold cases aren't
less important than new ones.

05:42.625 --> 05:43.792
They're more important.

05:43.875 --> 05:45.208
They've been waiting longer.

05:45.291 --> 05:47.375
We got any limits
on how far back we can look?

05:47.458 --> 05:48.917
No limits.

05:50.291 --> 05:53.208
There's some problems
with this job, boss.

05:53.291 --> 05:54.834
Unsolved is
always a problem.

05:54.917 --> 05:57.542
The ME reports
and the body chart
don't match.

05:57.625 --> 06:01.000
Plus the inventory of the
clothes in the van.

06:01.083 --> 06:02.208
Pants, underwear,

06:02.291 --> 06:04.709
shirt, shoes--
but no socks.

06:04.792 --> 06:06.083
Uh-huh.
This was February.

06:06.166 --> 06:09.583
You don't go anywhere in
February without socks.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.125
Maybe they were
inventoried wrong?

06:11.208 --> 06:12.792
Whatever happened,
this case was a rush job.

06:12.875 --> 06:15.125
The assigned chalked it up
to a solicitation gone bad.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.291
Pretty much
left it at
that.

06:17.375 --> 06:18.917
This is a nice lady, boss.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.625
And her memory's going fast.

06:20.709 --> 06:22.792
If we're ever going to look
at this again...

06:22.875 --> 06:24.041
We should do it now.

06:24.125 --> 06:25.417
Who's the assigned?

06:25.500 --> 06:26.792
Gil Sherman.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.000
This was a typical job
during the crack era.

06:30.083 --> 06:31.458
Guy comes 'round
looking
for some company,

06:31.542 --> 06:33.291
ends up robbed and
killed
by the girl.

06:33.375 --> 06:35.000
Why'd you think
it was a hooker?

06:35.083 --> 06:36.667
Ever been to Kensington Avenue,
darling?

06:36.750 --> 06:38.583
That's hookerland.

06:38.667 --> 06:41.834
Yeah? I grew up in Kensington.

06:41.917 --> 06:43.750
So what was he doing there,
seeing the sights?

06:43.834 --> 06:45.166
clearing throat

06:47.542 --> 06:49.125
You don't have
this back wound marked

06:49.208 --> 06:50.834
on your body chart.

06:50.917 --> 06:53.166
So I missed it.

06:53.250 --> 06:54.500
You ever miss a wound?

06:54.583 --> 06:55.625
No.

06:55.709 --> 06:57.291
LASSING:
What did forensics show you?

06:57.375 --> 06:59.500
Forensics were screwed.

06:59.583 --> 07:00.875
Rained like
a
son of a
bitch

07:00.959 --> 07:02.125
Whole scene got soaked.

07:02.208 --> 07:03.583
He was in the back of a van.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.333
They should have had
some evidence to work with.

07:05.417 --> 07:06.709
Partial
prints
on vials.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.000
Inconclusive.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.542
STILLMAN:
So there were
no suspects at all?

07:09.625 --> 07:11.500
Plenty of suspects.

07:11.583 --> 07:12.875
Whores,
dealers,
homeless.

07:12.959 --> 07:15.458
Nothing stuck.

07:15.542 --> 07:17.834
So that was it? End of case?

07:17.917 --> 07:19.500
Look, Rush--

07:19.583 --> 07:21.500
these murders were
a dime a dozen that year.

07:21.583 --> 07:22.959
Crackheads thought nothing

07:23.041 --> 07:25.166
of icing a guy for 12 bucks.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.333
Next night

07:26.417 --> 07:28.500
the same job all over again.

07:28.583 --> 07:29.792
You remember.

07:29.875 --> 07:31.166
Yeah.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.333
I felt for this family though.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.709
They were decent people.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.542
I had to tell 'em
on a Sunday morning...

07:47.125 --> 07:48.625
We found him
in his vehicle

07:48.709 --> 07:50.709
just off
of Kensington Avenue.

07:52.125 --> 07:56.208
I don't understand
why he'd be there.

07:57.625 --> 08:00.542
There's a lot
of activity in that area.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.500
What kind of activity?

08:03.625 --> 08:05.375
Drugs, prostitution.

08:05.458 --> 08:06.542
Like that.

08:06.625 --> 08:08.041
Mitch wouldn't be there.

08:08.125 --> 08:09.250
I'm sorry.

08:09.333 --> 08:10.959
Mitch didn't use drugs,

08:11.041 --> 08:12.375
or prostitutes.

08:12.458 --> 08:13.792
We are churchgoing people.

08:13.875 --> 08:16.583
I understand.

08:16.667 --> 08:21.250
He didn't use...

08:21.333 --> 08:22.667
prostitutes.

08:23.792 --> 08:26.542
Bayes was a
hypocrite
church type.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.250
Whoring Saturday night,

08:28.333 --> 08:30.667
asking
forgiveness
on Sunday.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.250
Son's meeting us here?

08:40.333 --> 08:42.375
Maybe he's already here.

08:43.417 --> 08:46.291
I'm sure
where they went exactly.

08:46.375 --> 08:47.750
No, I...

08:47.834 --> 08:50.583
I'm not sure.

08:50.667 --> 08:53.417
I... Yes.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.083
Okay.

08:56.166 --> 08:57.625
I'll...

08:57.709 --> 08:59.125
I'll tell them.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.250
When they...

09:02.333 --> 09:04.583
Okay, I'll make sure
I tell them.

09:04.667 --> 09:07.000
Hello.

09:07.083 --> 09:08.834
They're home now...

09:14.834 --> 09:16.250
Hi, Charlotte.

09:16.333 --> 09:17.875
Tina.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.250
No. No, Lilly.

09:21.333 --> 09:24.083
Remember we talked
about Mitch?

09:26.542 --> 09:27.875
"Mitchell Bayes served

09:27.959 --> 09:29.750
"as organist
and musical director

09:29.834 --> 09:33.291
at St. Anthony's Episcopal
Church in Roxborough..."

09:33.375 --> 09:34.875
RYAN:
Oh. You're
here.

09:34.959 --> 09:36.625
Did Mom let you in?

09:36.709 --> 09:38.041
The door was open, Ryan.

09:38.125 --> 09:39.625
Was she trying to leave?

09:39.709 --> 09:42.166
No, she was just
talking
to herself.

09:42.250 --> 09:43.834
She has good days and bad days.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.083
Can't have a church funeral
for Mitch...

09:46.166 --> 09:47.333
Okay.

09:47.417 --> 09:50.417
Just can't.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.709
Why is she talking about Dad?

09:51.792 --> 09:53.000
I brought him up.

09:53.083 --> 09:55.500
We're looking
at his case again, Ryan.

09:55.583 --> 09:58.166
I'll do what I can to help.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.375
I was only 16, you know.

10:00.458 --> 10:02.500
Do you know if your dad
had any enemies?

10:02.583 --> 10:04.542
Maybe someone from work,
or church?

10:04.625 --> 10:06.250
He worked at Drexel Insurance.

10:06.333 --> 10:07.792
I think it was
pretty mundane.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.500
At church
all he had was friends.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.166
Were you surprised to hear he
was found on Kensington Avenue?

10:14.250 --> 10:16.709
We were all shocked by that.

10:16.792 --> 10:18.041
Including your mom?

10:18.125 --> 10:21.458
I think it was
the humiliation of her life.

10:21.542 --> 10:24.792
Could we try to talk to her
about that night?

10:26.125 --> 10:27.583
It'll be tricky.

10:27.667 --> 10:29.375
She kind of
goes
in and out.

10:29.458 --> 10:30.792
Well, Mom...

10:33.166 --> 10:34.625
We're going to talk about Dad,

10:34.709 --> 10:35.792
okay?

10:35.875 --> 10:37.500
About the night he died.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.542
Okay... Mitch...

10:39.625 --> 10:42.750
He died, Mitch died...

10:42.834 --> 10:45.375
RYAN:
Remember we had dinner
as a family?

10:45.458 --> 10:47.417
And I was going
to a school formal,

10:47.500 --> 10:50.208
and I was worried
because I couldn't dance.

10:52.875 --> 10:54.750
I'll teach you.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.250
You remember that?

10:57.333 --> 11:01.291
Anyone can dance...

11:02.625 --> 11:03.875
Cheers.

11:06.125 --> 11:08.875
Okay, now let me show you
how it's done.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.250
Come on. Come on.

11:12.834 --> 11:16.834
'80s music playing

11:19.333 --> 11:21.458
Aw, loosen up, sweetie.

11:21.542 --> 11:22.667
I can't.

11:22.750 --> 11:23.917
I don't move right.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.125
Sure, you do.

11:25.208 --> 11:27.125
Come on.
Come on. Here.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.875
My best gal.

11:30.959 --> 11:32.291
Thanks.

11:32.375 --> 11:34.417
Go easy on him,
Charlotte.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.166
real

11:38.333 --> 11:40.000
phone rings

11:51.542 --> 11:53.917
Started out
as a nice
night.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.792
Who was the phone call from?

11:55.875 --> 11:57.959
I don't remember
a phone call.

11:58.041 --> 12:00.500
Your mom does.

12:00.583 --> 12:01.792
Huh?

12:01.875 --> 12:05.041
Maybe she's adding
that detail in her mind.

12:06.542 --> 12:07.834
Embellishing, you know?

12:07.917 --> 12:09.417
To be honest,
I'm still learning

12:09.500 --> 12:10.875
about what's happening to her.

12:10.959 --> 12:13.417
Ryan, could we get
your sister's address?

12:13.500 --> 12:14.709
Where she works?

12:14.792 --> 12:16.041
Yeah.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.458
RUSH:
Diabetes don't
scare you enough,

12:19.542 --> 12:21.625
you got to add smoking
to your health problems?

12:21.709 --> 12:23.041
Thanks, Lil.

12:23.125 --> 12:25.792
You know what?
I don't hear that
enough at home.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.083
I got that.

12:37.750 --> 12:38.917
You're Tina, right?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.041
Who are you?

12:40.125 --> 12:41.458
Detectives Rush
and Lassing, Homicide.

12:41.542 --> 12:42.834
We want to talk
about your dad.

12:42.917 --> 12:44.000
No, thanks.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.208
We know he dropped you

12:45.291 --> 12:46.500
at a friend's house
that night.

12:46.583 --> 12:47.834
I'm not talking
to any cops.

12:47.917 --> 12:49.166
How come?

12:50.542 --> 12:52.709
You guys decided
a long time ago

12:52.792 --> 12:53.917
how my dad died.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.375
Why you got to
bring it up again?

12:55.458 --> 12:57.000
We just want to
hear
about that night.

12:57.083 --> 12:58.166
What your dad
said to you.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.709
You mean,
like,
did he say,

12:59.792 --> 13:02.041
"Bye, darling,
I'm going to see my hooker"?

13:02.125 --> 13:03.750
You think
that's where he went?

13:03.834 --> 13:05.000
I never thought that.

13:05.083 --> 13:06.291
Tina, we're looking
for answers here.

13:06.375 --> 13:07.500
You can't give us
five minutes?

13:07.583 --> 13:08.792
Your mom and brother
helped us.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.125
They'd like you
to do the same.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.000
I haven't talked
to my mom or brother

13:12.083 --> 13:13.500
in eight years.

13:13.583 --> 13:16.333
So I could really care less
what they'd like.

13:27.083 --> 13:28.166
He was parked here.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.458
Found at 5:00 A.M.
by a homeless guy

13:29.542 --> 13:30.709
looking for someplace to sleep.

13:30.792 --> 13:32.834
So you're calling this
a crime scene?

13:32.917 --> 13:34.041
This is where it happened.

13:34.125 --> 13:37.500
Rush, that was 13 years ago.

13:37.583 --> 13:38.834
We ain't got much
to work with, Lil.

13:38.917 --> 13:40.083
It's what we got.

13:40.166 --> 13:41.750
You're standing next

13:41.834 --> 13:43.709
to the best scene man I know,
but I don't think there's
blood

13:43.792 --> 13:44.959
in that stone.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.250
Take a picture.

13:46.333 --> 13:47.792
Got to go find the girls
that Sherman talked to

13:47.875 --> 13:50.208
about Mitch Bayes.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.208
'80s music playing

14:01.500 --> 14:02.625
Hey, girls.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.375
whistles

14:04.458 --> 14:06.291
You know this guy.

14:06.375 --> 14:07.792
Naw.

14:08.834 --> 14:10.000
Uh-uh.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.166
Sure, you don't.

14:11.250 --> 14:14.750
Probably playing hopscotch
in 1990.

14:14.834 --> 14:16.458
Any girls out here
with some age on 'em?

14:16.542 --> 14:19.583
Delores, Rhona,
Rhono, Mary?

14:19.667 --> 14:20.875
Delores--

14:20.959 --> 14:22.166
she's, like, 33.

14:22.250 --> 14:24.417
is

14:24.500 --> 14:25.750
Know where we can find her?

14:25.834 --> 14:27.083
Works the alley.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.625
She only do oral now

14:28.709 --> 14:30.625
'cause of HIV.

14:30.709 --> 14:32.250
Thanks.

14:32.333 --> 14:33.959
got

14:34.041 --> 14:35.250
or she doesn't want
to get it?

14:35.333 --> 14:36.709
I don't need to know.

14:38.041 --> 14:40.500
Delores?
Delores?

14:40.583 --> 14:42.792
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

14:42.875 --> 14:46.583
Remember this guy,
Delores? Mitch Bayes?

14:46.667 --> 14:48.208
Yeah. Yeah, that
guy
died down there

14:48.291 --> 14:49.458
behind the Dumpster.

14:49.542 --> 14:50.667
Is he a trick of yours?

14:50.750 --> 14:52.959
No, I never seen him before.

14:53.041 --> 14:54.125
Nobody had.

14:54.208 --> 14:57.959
Know where I can find
a Rhona or Mary?

14:58.041 --> 14:59.208
Rhona moved back
to Delaware,

14:59.291 --> 15:01.333
back to her Mom's
where her kids are at.

15:01.417 --> 15:02.750
Mary got the AIDS.

15:02.834 --> 15:04.959
She died,
like, a year ago.

15:06.458 --> 15:09.542
That looks kind of funny,
you know?

15:09.625 --> 15:11.000
RUSH:
Funny how?

15:11.083 --> 15:12.500
I never seen a guy

15:12.583 --> 15:14.250
take all his
clothes
off for a girl

15:14.333 --> 15:15.709
and leave 'em
in the corner

15:15.792 --> 15:17.709
all tidy like that.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.625
Right.

15:19.709 --> 15:22.750
Thanks, Delores.
Take care of yourself.

15:24.458 --> 15:25.792
She's right.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.500
The scene's off.

15:27.583 --> 15:28.709
There are a lot
of props:

15:28.792 --> 15:30.333
the crack
vials,
the magazines.

15:30.417 --> 15:31.542
It's all wrong.

15:31.625 --> 15:33.750
Mitch Bayes didn't
hang out here.

15:33.834 --> 15:36.208
We got to redeem
this guy.

15:36.291 --> 15:38.291
Henry Walsh-- his name's
on one of these porn rags

15:38.375 --> 15:39.583
that was found in the van.

15:39.667 --> 15:42.333
He's not in your file.

15:42.417 --> 15:44.792
Do you know who he is?

15:44.875 --> 15:46.834
Great, Sherman. Got to run.

15:46.917 --> 15:49.458
A simple yes or no
don't work for Sherman.

15:49.542 --> 15:51.166
I take it
he didn't auto-track Walsh.

15:51.250 --> 15:55.333
Probably too busy
with all the crack going on.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.166
You guys again?

15:57.250 --> 15:58.667
You were right, Tina.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.000
About what?

16:00.083 --> 16:02.709
Your dad didn't go
with a hooker that night.

16:02.792 --> 16:03.792
How do you know?

16:03.875 --> 16:06.041
We think someone drove him
to that alley

16:06.125 --> 16:07.291
after they killed him.

16:07.375 --> 16:08.542
That cop told us...

16:08.625 --> 16:10.875
That cop was wrong.

16:10.959 --> 16:12.000
I knew it.

16:12.083 --> 16:14.917
I knew my dad
was too good for that.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.959
You were close, huh?

16:17.041 --> 16:18.959
Yeah.

16:19.041 --> 16:21.625
We're looking
for the truth here, Tina.

16:21.709 --> 16:23.917
Can you help us
and talk to us?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.375
About what?

16:25.458 --> 16:26.625
Start with the
night
he died.

16:26.709 --> 16:28.083
Was there a phone call?

16:28.166 --> 16:32.166
Nice families
don't talk about these things.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.583
Tina, what things?

16:33.667 --> 16:35.834
What was
the phone call?

16:35.917 --> 16:37.834
It was for him.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.083
Do you know who it was?

16:39.166 --> 16:40.875
I had an idea.

16:40.959 --> 16:43.125
<i>I know where you're going now.</i>

16:43.208 --> 16:45.709
I'm going home.

16:45.792 --> 16:47.834
No, you're not.

16:47.917 --> 16:49.750
What are you
talking about?

16:49.834 --> 16:51.083
Don't go.

16:51.166 --> 16:53.500
Call her and say no.

16:53.583 --> 16:56.000
T-Tina!

16:56.083 --> 16:57.917
Go on in the house.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.667
I can see Cindy's
waiting for you.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.917
You're always talking
about what's a sin

17:04.000 --> 17:05.083
and all that.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.834
is

17:07.917 --> 17:10.166
what you're doing with Judy.

17:12.083 --> 17:14.083
You get out
of this car.

17:27.709 --> 17:31.000
That was our last conversation.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.000
Who was Judy?

17:33.083 --> 17:34.208
I don't know.

17:34.291 --> 17:37.208
I just heard him
talking on the phone to her.

17:37.291 --> 17:38.542
After he died,
I thought

17:38.625 --> 17:42.625
maybe it was
a prostitute that...

17:44.625 --> 17:47.083
Do you think
your mom knew about Judy?

17:47.166 --> 17:49.834
I wouldn't know that.

17:49.917 --> 17:51.959
Maybe you should go
with us to see your
mom.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.458
Ask her about
this woman.

17:53.542 --> 17:55.333
Why don't you ask her?

17:55.417 --> 17:57.083
You probably would have
a better chance

17:57.166 --> 17:59.250
of getting through
with her condition.

18:01.625 --> 18:03.083
What condition?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.500
Your brother says
it's Alzheimer's.

18:18.041 --> 18:19.667
You're probably going
to have to help

18:19.750 --> 18:20.959
the conversation along.

18:21.041 --> 18:22.583
Don't worry.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.083
The door's open again.

18:31.667 --> 18:33.041
mumbling

18:34.792 --> 18:37.125
Mom?

18:39.834 --> 18:41.333
mumbling softly

18:44.792 --> 18:48.000
Oh, God... Mom.

18:52.542 --> 18:54.792
It's Tina.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.709
Ba-ba.

18:56.792 --> 18:59.792
muttering

19:02.125 --> 19:03.709
Mom?

19:04.792 --> 19:06.375
We'll give you
a minute, Tina.

19:33.458 --> 19:34.959
Las,
what's that about?

19:54.166 --> 19:58.625
I wish you would
comb your hair.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.583
She knows me now.

20:02.667 --> 20:05.333
Can we talk to her?

20:05.417 --> 20:06.458
Mom,

20:06.542 --> 20:09.834
we want to talk
about Judy.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.000
Judy...

20:12.083 --> 20:13.375
Yeah,

20:13.458 --> 20:15.917
Judy and Dad.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.083
humming

20:19.166 --> 20:21.458
Judy...

20:23.583 --> 20:25.542
I never,

20:25.625 --> 20:28.250
never cared for Judy.

20:29.083 --> 20:30.417
I never cared for Judy.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.458
Judy.

20:32.542 --> 20:33.750
Who was she, Charlotte?

20:33.834 --> 20:36.083
How did you know her?

21:04.583 --> 21:06.333
<i>Judy Enright.</i>

21:06.417 --> 21:11.000
I never cared for Judy Enright.

21:11.083 --> 21:14.083
Charlotte, it's okay.

21:14.166 --> 21:16.333
What's going on here?

21:16.417 --> 21:18.166
Never cared for Judy...

21:18.250 --> 21:20.333
I never cared
for Judy.

21:20.417 --> 21:21.625
What are you doing here?

21:21.709 --> 21:22.875
I just...

21:22.959 --> 21:24.166
I thought I'd come...

21:24.250 --> 21:25.458
What?

21:25.542 --> 21:26.792
I never,

21:26.875 --> 21:28.041
never liked Judy.

21:28.125 --> 21:29.250
I don't know.

21:29.333 --> 21:30.458
We asked her to come.

21:30.542 --> 21:32.333
Well, I'm asking
you to leave.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.625
They believed me about Dad,
Ryan.

21:34.709 --> 21:35.792
Good for you.

21:35.875 --> 21:37.125
Charlotte mumbling

21:37.208 --> 21:38.375
Congratulations.

21:38.458 --> 21:39.750
I really do
want to help you,

21:39.834 --> 21:41.250
but I'm not coming
back here.

21:41.333 --> 21:46.208
She always,
always has the solos.

21:46.291 --> 21:47.750
She always...

21:48.792 --> 21:50.000
You shouldn't
have come here.

21:50.083 --> 21:51.208
Strangers upset her.

21:51.291 --> 21:52.500
We thought with Tina...

21:52.583 --> 21:53.709
You thought wrong.

21:53.792 --> 21:55.542
The most talented singer...

21:55.625 --> 21:57.250
She was talking
to us about Judy.

21:57.333 --> 21:59.709
That name mean anything to you?

21:59.792 --> 22:01.625
No. Look,
you should know

22:01.709 --> 22:04.208
my sister
has emotional problems.

22:04.291 --> 22:05.792
She's been hospitalized
a few times

22:05.875 --> 22:07.041
and sometimes
she says things

22:07.125 --> 22:08.542
that aren't necessarily true.

22:08.625 --> 22:11.917
You should know your front door
was open again, Ryan.

22:13.625 --> 22:17.792
Tina says your dad was
close to this woman.

22:17.875 --> 22:20.917
And I told you
that she has mental problems.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.333
Excuse me.

22:24.208 --> 22:25.667
Judy...

22:35.583 --> 22:36.625
Come in.

22:36.709 --> 22:38.875
Something going on
with this family, boss.

22:38.959 --> 22:40.166
LASSING:
The brother and sister

22:40.250 --> 22:41.417
hate each other.
She says they've been

22:41.500 --> 22:43.000
oil and water
ever since dad died.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.834
He says it's because
she's crazy.

22:44.917 --> 22:46.959
Plus that door upstairs.

22:47.041 --> 22:48.750
Do you, uh,

22:48.834 --> 22:50.917
trust this Tina?

22:51.000 --> 22:52.583
She seems more sad
than crazy.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.417
She was hospitalized twice
for depression,

22:54.500 --> 22:56.291
but that doesn't make her
a liar.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.542
So, follow her lead,
see where it takes you.

22:58.625 --> 23:00.417
Where do you
find
Judy Enright?

23:00.500 --> 23:03.667
She works at St. Anthony's
Church in Roxborough.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.667
You better wash up.

23:07.875 --> 23:10.208
Poor Mitch.

23:10.291 --> 23:12.500
It was such a disgrace...

23:13.875 --> 23:15.083
how he ended up.

23:15.166 --> 23:16.792
The flesh is weak.

23:16.875 --> 23:19.333
Yes, it is.

23:19.417 --> 23:21.417
How well
did you know Mitch?

23:21.500 --> 23:23.750
Well, the congregation here
is very tight-knit.

23:23.834 --> 23:28.166
Plus, him on the
organ
and you singing
solos...

23:28.250 --> 23:31.250
Did you see Mitch
the night he died?

23:31.333 --> 23:33.625
Unless we had a rehearsal,
I don't see how...

23:33.709 --> 23:34.875
Judy, I have phone records
that show me

23:34.959 --> 23:36.125
two calls were made
from your home

23:36.208 --> 23:37.583
to the Bayes' home that night.

23:40.083 --> 23:41.208
Well, I suppose

23:41.291 --> 23:42.792
you already know, then.

23:44.959 --> 23:48.667
I was weak, too.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.917
So did you meet Mitch
the night he died?

23:52.834 --> 23:55.166
Just for a few minutes.

23:55.250 --> 24:02.583
'80s music playing

24:04.917 --> 24:08.917
Hi. Why don't you park?

24:12.041 --> 24:15.041
I can't do it anymore.

24:15.125 --> 24:16.792
What?

24:16.875 --> 24:18.834
Tina knows.

24:20.166 --> 24:23.834
I can't have my
daughter
being ashamed of me.

24:25.792 --> 24:27.250
Mitch, come on, honey.

24:27.333 --> 24:30.333
We'll talk about it.

24:30.417 --> 24:33.250
I got to stop.

24:34.917 --> 24:38.834
She's my daughter.

24:40.792 --> 24:42.208
JUDY:
<i>And that's the last</i>

24:42.291 --> 24:44.041
I saw of Mitch Bayes.

24:45.291 --> 24:46.750
Are you sure you didn't
follow him, Judy,

24:47.542 --> 24:48.709
in your anger at him,

24:48.792 --> 24:50.041
for breaking
it off like that?

24:50.125 --> 24:51.125
No.

24:51.208 --> 24:53.417
But you called Mitch
again later.

24:53.500 --> 24:55.834
There were two calls from
your house that night,
Judy.

24:55.917 --> 24:57.667
I didn't call again.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.959
Could your husband
have called him?

25:00.041 --> 25:01.208
He'd have no reason to.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.458
Unless he suspected you two.

25:07.625 --> 25:09.625
So did Lassing
embarrass
you in church?

25:09.709 --> 25:11.917
No, he behaved.
And we met Mitch's girlfriend.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.667
Oh, yeah?
She a suspect?

25:13.750 --> 25:16.083
Her alibi's good,
but there was a
jealous husband.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.583
Vera and Jeffries
are checking him
out.

25:17.667 --> 25:20.291
Mitch's clothes from
the van-- no socks.

25:20.375 --> 25:21.625
Is this criminalist
screwing up,

25:21.709 --> 25:23.542
or were they never there
in the first place?

25:23.625 --> 25:26.375
You might want to ask
your pal Sherman over there.

25:29.667 --> 25:31.959
People steal stuff off
the dead bodies all the time.

25:32.041 --> 25:34.250
People steal
Timberlands,
leather jackets.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.542
They don't steal a guy's
socks and nothing else.

25:36.625 --> 25:38.333
Fine.
You know best, apparently.

25:38.417 --> 25:39.917
Sherman, it's a
simple question.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Were the socks at
the scene or not?

25:42.083 --> 25:44.041
No.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.083
Are you sure?

25:47.458 --> 25:49.583
I'm pretty sure.

25:52.917 --> 25:56.792
You're known as a good
detective, Sherman.

25:56.875 --> 25:59.583
They say you're the
best in Fugitives.

25:59.667 --> 26:02.250
Is that what they say?

26:02.333 --> 26:04.333
So what was going
on in 1990

26:04.417 --> 26:07.291
that you were
doing
work like a bum?

26:13.542 --> 26:16.000
Nothing that ain't fixed now.

26:24.208 --> 26:28.125
1988 to mid-'94...

26:28.208 --> 26:30.166
I was a drunk.

26:30.250 --> 26:33.625
I mean bombed full-time.

26:35.166 --> 26:38.667
So probably I did some damage,

26:38.750 --> 26:42.166
being sloppy.

26:42.250 --> 26:43.417
Just...

26:43.500 --> 26:45.375
wasn't in my head.

26:45.458 --> 26:48.041
Uh-huh.

26:48.125 --> 26:52.458
You know that, uh, name you
wanted followed up: Henry Walsh?

26:52.542 --> 26:54.500
The guy whose porn mags
were found in the van?

26:54.583 --> 26:55.834
Did you auto-track him yet?

26:55.917 --> 26:57.083
Uh, not yet.

26:57.166 --> 26:58.875
Good. 'Cause I did.

26:58.959 --> 27:00.208
Figured I'd save
you some time.

27:00.291 --> 27:01.500
Oh, yeah?

27:01.583 --> 27:02.959
Mm-hmm.

27:03.041 --> 27:06.041
Let see, he had a carpet
business in Germantown.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.083
He died three years ago,

27:09.166 --> 27:12.583
but I got an address
on the son, Tom Walsh,

27:12.667 --> 27:14.750
if that'll help.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.166
It would.

27:26.125 --> 27:28.500
TOM:
I don't know who
my
dad knew or

27:28.583 --> 27:30.041
Pretty strange how his porn rags

27:30.125 --> 27:32.542
ended up in a van
with a dead man.

27:32.625 --> 27:34.375
What am I supposed to do
about that?

27:34.458 --> 27:38.291
How about giving it more
than 30 seconds of
thought?

27:38.375 --> 27:41.250
Bayes... I knew a Ryan Bayes
in high school.

27:41.333 --> 27:43.834
There you go, Tom.
Were you good friends?

27:43.917 --> 27:45.250
I guess.

27:45.333 --> 27:47.542
We played a lot of Dungeons
and Dragons together.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.875
Just nerds, you know.

27:51.333 --> 27:54.583
Nerds who looked at
dad's porn together?

27:58.208 --> 28:00.667
I probably took some magazines
there sometimes.

28:02.542 --> 28:05.083
You guys ever take
it
to another level,

28:05.166 --> 28:07.125
like, uh,
going to
hookers?

28:10.458 --> 28:12.083
Do we really
got to go into this?

28:12.166 --> 28:14.500
I've heard so much worse, Tom.

28:16.667 --> 28:19.417
I guess we cruised
for prostitutes
once in a while,

28:19.500 --> 28:20.959
just to look at them.

28:21.041 --> 28:23.250
We'd be terrified if they
actually talked to us.

28:23.333 --> 28:26.542
Where'd you do that cruising?

28:26.625 --> 28:28.583
Kensington Avenue.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.250
You see, Tom,
that's helpful to me.

28:33.333 --> 28:34.792
Embarrassing to you,

28:34.875 --> 28:37.208
but helpful to me.

28:40.667 --> 28:42.208
phone ringing

28:42.834 --> 28:44.125
Ring, ring.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.959
RYAN:
I'll get it, Mom.
Ringing.

28:48.041 --> 28:49.500
Now is not a good time.

28:49.583 --> 28:50.792
We got to talk, Ryan.

28:50.875 --> 28:52.166
Not now.
LASSING:
It's very important.

28:52.250 --> 28:53.709
RYAN:
Mom, go back to
the living
room.

28:53.792 --> 28:55.291
Someone's here.
Someone's here.

28:55.375 --> 28:56.959
Did you hear me?
Go back to the living room.

28:57.041 --> 28:58.125
Tea, tea, tea.

28:58.208 --> 29:00.458
Ryan, hey, let's
you and me sit
down.

29:00.542 --> 29:02.417
A couple of minutes.

29:02.500 --> 29:03.792
You need a
minute of
peace.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.333
Las will sit
with your mom.

29:05.417 --> 29:06.750
Come on, take a break.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.750
Isn't there someone
that can help you out?

29:16.291 --> 29:17.792
A girlfriend?

29:19.250 --> 29:21.500
I don't have time for that.

29:22.375 --> 29:24.709
sighs

29:24.792 --> 29:27.667
We guess your mom's
kind of your girlfriend, huh?

29:27.750 --> 29:31.625
She takes a lot of my
time,
if that's what you mean.

29:31.709 --> 29:33.417
Yeah.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.166
I take care of my mom, too.

29:35.250 --> 29:39.542
She's sick in a different
kind of way,

29:39.625 --> 29:43.959
but, uh, it makes me
half crazy sometimes.

29:44.041 --> 29:45.834
Yeah.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.917
Doesn't feel natural.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.375
It's role reversal.

29:49.458 --> 29:52.500
Yeah. I mean,
Mom's supposed
to take care of you.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.208
That's what
you're used
to.

29:54.291 --> 29:57.208
Yeah.

29:57.291 --> 29:59.458
Did she take
good care of you?

29:59.542 --> 30:01.375
Yeah, sure.

30:01.458 --> 30:04.208
She let you meet girls?

30:04.291 --> 30:05.875
Or did she keep you in

30:05.959 --> 30:09.917
so you had to look elsewhere
for those interests?

30:10.000 --> 30:13.291
I'm not sure I know
what you're talking
about.

30:17.291 --> 30:20.375
I guess I mean these.

30:20.458 --> 30:22.083
Those aren't mine.

30:22.166 --> 30:25.375
Technically they belong
to your friend Tom Walsh.

30:25.458 --> 30:26.834
Remember him?
Uh-uh.

30:26.917 --> 30:28.083
No? He's the guy

30:28.166 --> 30:30.250
you used to cruise
Kensington Avenue with.

30:30.333 --> 30:32.041
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

30:32.125 --> 30:34.667
Thing is, I need explanations
for all these lies.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.250
Because it looks bad
that you lied

30:36.333 --> 30:38.417
about the phone call
from Judy Enright that night.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.959
And that you lied to me just now

30:40.041 --> 30:41.333
about these periodicals here,
Ryan.

30:41.417 --> 30:42.667
I want you to leave.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.333
And it really
looks
bad that you
were

30:44.417 --> 30:46.750
so familiar with the strip
where your dad was dumped.

30:46.834 --> 30:48.834
I got questions
that need answers here, Ryan.

30:48.917 --> 30:50.458
And without
good answers,

30:50.542 --> 30:52.083
you're my number-one suspect.

30:52.166 --> 30:54.458
My mom and I are not talking
to you anymore.

30:54.542 --> 30:56.417
You speak for your mom?

30:56.500 --> 30:58.750
Yeah, I do.
And you know what?

30:58.834 --> 31:01.250
We want you to drop
my dad's case.

31:01.333 --> 31:04.208
When I'm so close
to the truth?

31:04.291 --> 31:06.000
Not a chance.

31:06.083 --> 31:08.333
Well, that was
one
hot trail you
sent

31:08.417 --> 31:09.500
You met Enright?

31:09.583 --> 31:11.083
You call that
guy a suspect?

31:11.166 --> 31:12.750
He's a 90-pound invalid.

31:12.834 --> 31:14.834
He's been in a
wheelchair
since the Great Flood.

31:14.917 --> 31:16.917
No chance he
stabbed anybody

31:17.041 --> 31:18.625
in the last century.

31:18.709 --> 31:21.208
Okay, but was he our
second caller that night?

31:21.291 --> 31:22.792
Called Mitch to give
him
a piece of his mind.

31:22.875 --> 31:24.125
Talked to the boy instead.

31:24.208 --> 31:25.458
Ryan.

31:25.542 --> 31:28.917
Yeah. I mean, he probably
traumatized that kid.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.333
Must have told
him 40 times

31:30.417 --> 31:32.667
what a
cheating
sinner his old
man was.

31:32.750 --> 31:35.000
Gives mama's boy his motive.

31:35.083 --> 31:37.333
Mm-hmm. Tina...

31:37.417 --> 31:38.750
Tina...

31:39.834 --> 31:41.458
thanks for coming.

31:43.250 --> 31:45.333
Did you find out anything?

31:45.417 --> 31:46.709
Yeah.

31:50.542 --> 31:51.709
Listen, Tina...

31:51.792 --> 31:53.583
we think we
can put Ryan

31:53.667 --> 31:55.291
at the murder scene.

31:57.709 --> 31:59.458
Ryan?

31:59.542 --> 32:01.250
Yeah.

32:08.250 --> 32:10.166
This is how you help me--

32:10.250 --> 32:12.792
"Your dad wasn't a scumbag
after all,

32:12.875 --> 32:17.083
but your brother's a murderer"?

32:17.750 --> 32:20.208
I'm sorry.

32:20.291 --> 32:23.375
We used to be really close,

32:23.458 --> 32:27.000
me and my brother.

32:27.083 --> 32:29.458
Do you think you could help us
one more time?

32:31.417 --> 32:33.917
Can you do it for your dad?

32:42.083 --> 32:43.750
A... a dance.

32:43.834 --> 32:45.875
We really have to go
to church tomorrow.

32:45.959 --> 32:51.000
There was a... sleep...
sleep... sleepover...

32:51.083 --> 32:52.709
and a dance,

32:52.792 --> 32:55.166
and that... that's
where
the kids were
going...

32:55.250 --> 32:57.375
kids were going...
sleepover...

32:57.458 --> 33:00.417
That-that was
a big... dance...

33:00.500 --> 33:01.875
I know that part,
Charlotte.

33:01.959 --> 33:03.709
I'm talking about later.

33:03.792 --> 33:09.041
I-I-I... I danced,
I danced with Ryan.

33:09.125 --> 33:11.375
After the dancing,
much later,

33:11.458 --> 33:13.333
did Ryan fight with Mitch?

33:17.375 --> 33:18.417
Poor Mitch.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.917
Poor, poor,
poor,
poor Mitch.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.250
After the dancing,
did Ryan do something to him?

33:24.333 --> 33:25.583
Mitch... Mitch...

33:25.667 --> 33:26.875
Charlotte.

33:26.959 --> 33:29.792
Mitch, Mitch, base...
Mitch took-took you...

33:29.875 --> 33:31.667
Mitch took you,
Mitch took you
to...

33:31.750 --> 33:33.959
you s... your
sleepover...
Mitch...

33:34.041 --> 33:36.792
He took me to the sleepover?

33:36.875 --> 33:39.917
CHARLOTTE:
Mitch took you,
Mitch took
you...

33:47.417 --> 33:50.166
Tin-Tina?

33:52.166 --> 33:54.083
Tina...

33:54.166 --> 33:57.750
It's okay to tell me, Mom.

33:57.834 --> 33:59.542
What did Ryan do?

34:01.875 --> 34:03.166
Mom...

34:03.250 --> 34:04.959
What happened?

34:05.041 --> 34:06.375
Clothes...

34:06.458 --> 34:07.792
Clothes? Dad's clothes?

34:07.875 --> 34:12.125
Ge-Get thos... get those...
get tho... get those...

34:12.208 --> 34:13.291
Get that!

34:13.375 --> 34:14.750
Get that!
Put it in! Put it in!

34:14.834 --> 34:16.750
Yes, hurry!
Put the clothes... I'll...

34:16.834 --> 34:17.959
I'll fo...

34:18.041 --> 34:20.375
I'll fo...

34:21.333 --> 34:23.959
I'll follow.

34:24.041 --> 34:26.083
tires squealing

34:52.834 --> 34:54.000
Hey!

34:54.083 --> 34:56.458
Get that! Get that!

34:57.083 --> 34:58.333
Get that!

34:59.083 --> 35:01.959
Get that over there.

35:02.041 --> 35:03.542
Over there!

35:03.625 --> 35:05.500
Get that over there!

35:05.583 --> 35:07.083
Get those vials!

35:07.166 --> 35:08.458
Yes!

35:08.542 --> 35:10.583
Yes, hurry!

35:23.667 --> 35:25.500
Put them.... put them in?

35:25.583 --> 35:26.834
Yes.

35:26.917 --> 35:29.083
Yes! Hurry!

35:30.750 --> 35:32.375
Hurry!

35:49.792 --> 35:51.583
Okay, Charlotte.

35:52.959 --> 35:54.417
Okay.

35:56.959 --> 35:58.625
You've totally
disrupted my
family.

35:58.709 --> 36:00.083
No, that was you, Ryan.

36:00.166 --> 36:02.125
You and your mom,
13 years ago.

36:02.208 --> 36:04.125
We heard all about
you staging the scene.

36:04.208 --> 36:06.208
When you weren't
there
to chaperone,

36:06.291 --> 36:08.750
your mom gave us
the details.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.375
You took advantage
of a sick, old
woman?

36:11.458 --> 36:12.667
But you forgot
the socks.

36:12.750 --> 36:14.208
laughs

36:14.291 --> 36:17.250
Nice touch with the crack vials,
though-- real respectful to dad.

36:17.333 --> 36:18.583
I respected my dad.

36:18.667 --> 36:19.792
Really?

36:19.875 --> 36:21.083
I respected my mom, too.

36:21.166 --> 36:22.834
What was I supposed to do?

36:22.917 --> 36:24.500
You trying to blame Mom?

36:24.583 --> 36:26.667
Mom who treated you
like
you walked on water?

36:26.750 --> 36:28.125
I never asked for that.

36:28.208 --> 36:30.125
I didn't want to be her pet;
she chose me.

36:30.208 --> 36:31.375
I couldn't shake her.

36:31.458 --> 36:34.250
Like you can't
shake her now.

36:34.333 --> 36:37.625
You dreamed of
being an adult,
right?

36:37.709 --> 36:40.000
Finally escaping her?

36:40.083 --> 36:41.625
But then Mom got sick.

36:41.709 --> 36:44.709
softly
And now you're
trapped again.

36:48.291 --> 36:52.709
You have no idea
how much she needs.

36:52.792 --> 36:54.125
I know, Ryan.

36:54.208 --> 36:56.041
That's why you leave
the front door open.

36:56.125 --> 36:58.792
Maybe she'll wander
away for good,

36:58.875 --> 37:00.917
and then you'll be free.

37:03.250 --> 37:04.667
I love my mom.

37:04.750 --> 37:08.959
But you're angry at her
for what she made you
do:

37:09.041 --> 37:11.792
Committing murder in her name.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.166
I didn't do that.

37:15.250 --> 37:18.709
Come on, Ryan, you're
a classic mama's boy.

37:18.792 --> 37:20.208
What better way
to protect your mom

37:20.291 --> 37:21.959
than to kill the guy
who's done her wrong?

37:22.041 --> 37:27.834
My mom didn't need protecting
from anyone.

37:27.917 --> 37:30.834
What's that supposed
to mean?

37:33.041 --> 37:35.500
You only know her
as this feeble
woman

37:35.583 --> 37:37.625
who gets confused
and scared,

37:37.709 --> 37:40.917
and you probably
feel bad for her.

37:44.375 --> 37:48.625
But you didn't see her
in her prime...

37:48.709 --> 37:50.542
when she terrorized us.

37:51.750 --> 37:54.083
We weren't supposed
to talk about it.

37:54.166 --> 37:58.000
Nice family
keeping up appearances.

37:58.083 --> 37:59.458
She would bitch me
and Tina out

37:59.542 --> 38:00.834
all the time.

38:00.917 --> 38:02.208
When it got really bad--

38:02.291 --> 38:05.208
when she was good
and drunk and crazy--

38:05.291 --> 38:07.625
she would attack my dad.

38:08.542 --> 38:10.291
Hit him?

38:10.375 --> 38:12.834
He never hit her back.

38:12.917 --> 38:14.625
He would
just take
it,

38:14.709 --> 38:17.875
and get away as soon
as possible.

38:19.667 --> 38:22.834
Is that why he had
all those locks
on his bedroom door?

38:27.125 --> 38:31.166
He couldn't sleep
if he didn't lock
himself in at night.

38:34.917 --> 38:37.333
That's how scared he was of her.

38:46.375 --> 38:49.583
And still he stood up
for me that night.

38:51.792 --> 38:55.375
Knowing what
she could do to him.

38:57.333 --> 38:59.291
footsteps approaching

38:59.375 --> 39:00.667
door opens

39:00.750 --> 39:02.291
sighs wearily

39:09.667 --> 39:11.917
Why are you home, Ryan?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.333
Why aren't you at the dance?

39:15.667 --> 39:18.709
Mom didn't want me to go.

39:20.959 --> 39:25.625
We had an interesting
call tonight.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.750
He had a date, Charlotte.

39:29.834 --> 39:35.750
Well, apparently,
you both had dates.

39:35.834 --> 39:37.250
All right, get your jacket.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.333
I'll take you
to the dance myself.

39:39.417 --> 39:40.709
No,

39:40.792 --> 39:42.000
he's staying with me.

39:42.083 --> 39:43.875
Look, he's 16 years old,
Charlotte.

39:43.959 --> 39:45.041
He doesn't want to sit home

39:45.125 --> 39:46.875
on a Saturday night
with his mother.

39:46.959 --> 39:48.125
Yes, he does!

39:48.208 --> 39:49.500
Yes, he does.

39:51.041 --> 39:57.500
Unlike you, who would rather
be sneaking around with Judy.

39:57.583 --> 39:58.959
Don't do this in front of Ryan.

39:59.041 --> 40:02.125
Ryan? Ryan took the call!

40:02.208 --> 40:04.041
This is between
you and me,

40:04.125 --> 40:05.750
and I'm going to take him
over to the dance,

40:05.834 --> 40:08.000
and when I come back,
we can talk about it.

40:08.083 --> 40:11.208
He's staying with me!

40:12.667 --> 40:14.291
He loves me.

40:15.208 --> 40:17.250
He loves me.

40:17.333 --> 40:18.875
Don't you, Ryan?

40:18.959 --> 40:21.583
I do.

40:21.667 --> 40:23.458
But I want to go to the dance.

40:23.542 --> 40:24.667
What?

40:24.750 --> 40:26.834
The both of you
teaming up against me?

40:26.917 --> 40:28.041
Ryan,
get your jacket now.

40:28.125 --> 40:29.333
CHARLOTTE:
Wha... Ryan, d...

40:29.417 --> 40:30.542
I am not going
to talk to you

40:30.625 --> 40:31.834
when you're
like this, Charlotte.

40:31.917 --> 40:33.041
Do you
understand that?

40:33.125 --> 40:34.333
Now I'm going
to go upstairs

40:34.417 --> 40:36.667
and I'm going to get
some dry clothes.

40:36.750 --> 40:39.625
Mitchell... Mitchell!

40:39.709 --> 40:41.375
Ryan!

40:41.458 --> 40:42.667
Mi...

40:42.750 --> 40:44.875
Ryan...

40:44.959 --> 40:46.625
Mitchell!

40:47.500 --> 40:48.542
Mitchell!

40:48.625 --> 40:50.166
Mom, Mom...
Mitchell! No!

40:50.250 --> 40:51.166
No!

40:51.250 --> 40:56.500
Judy Enright is cheap
Christmas trash!

40:56.583 --> 41:00.667
She's a disgrace
and you're a disgrace

41:00.750 --> 41:02.959
to good churchgoing people!

41:03.834 --> 41:07.083
Do not shut me out!

41:07.166 --> 41:09.291
Don't... you...

41:10.458 --> 41:13.500
Don't you shut me out!

41:13.583 --> 41:14.709
Mom!

41:14.792 --> 41:17.375
Do not shut me out!

41:17.458 --> 41:20.000
You will not disgrace me!

41:21.625 --> 41:23.375
Don't you shut me out!

41:25.500 --> 41:26.667
No!

41:26.750 --> 41:29.709
Do not disgrace me!

41:29.792 --> 41:30.917
yelling

41:31.000 --> 41:33.709
piercing scream

41:33.792 --> 41:35.834
screaming

41:39.959 --> 41:41.917
Charlotte grunts

41:50.000 --> 41:51.083
Ryan...

41:51.166 --> 41:52.375
sniffles

41:52.458 --> 41:54.333
Get the van.

42:14.208 --> 42:25.000
'80s music playing

42:42.041 --> 42:47.542
music continues throughout
