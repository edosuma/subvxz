WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:03.128
[school bell sounds]

00:11.386 --> 00:14.055
Twenty minutes left.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.308
-Yes Nathan.
-Sir, we have to go.

00:16.308 --> 00:19.561
Oh! Yeah, sorry guys.
Our athletes.

00:19.561 --> 00:23.064
-Sir, why do they get to leave?
-Because they have a game Ben.

00:23.064 --> 00:26.401
Sir, I didn't get through
much of my test.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.320
Oh, okay.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.905
I didn't get much done
either, sir.

00:29.905 --> 00:33.826
Ahhh, okay. Uh,
take them home all right?

00:33.826 --> 00:36.077
Play the game, take them home,
bring them back tomorrow.

00:36.077 --> 00:38.163
Perfect! Solves
that problem, okay?

00:38.163 --> 00:40.499
Hey! Let me ask you this.
What's it like at the games?

00:40.499 --> 00:42.584
A lot of girls probably go, eh?
Is that fun?

00:42.584 --> 00:45.128
Playing in front of all the
girls, that's gotta be cool.

00:45.128 --> 00:48.007
You just, you try and focus
on the game.

00:48.007 --> 00:51.010
Yeah, true.
What about you Nathan?

00:51.010 --> 00:55.055
Ummm... Sir, this is getting
a little awkward.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.684
-I think we should take off now.
-I know, 'cause we're all...
okay.

01:00.686 --> 01:04.189
Win one for the school. Okay?

01:04.189 --> 01:07.150
I'll walk you out.
Loosen up, stay loose.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.028
Athletes.

01:09.862 --> 01:12.364
Athlete.

01:12.364 --> 01:15.242
If you were an athlete
you might get some girls.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.996
-How would...?
-Shhh! Sh, sh, sh!

01:18.996 --> 01:21.749
You're writing a test,
no talking.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.876
♪ I'm awesome
No you're not dude, don't lie ♪

01:23.876 --> 01:26.837
♪ I'm awesome
I'm driving around
in my mom's ride ♪

01:26.837 --> 01:30.089
♪ I'm awesome

01:31.842 --> 01:34.678
♪ I'm awesome ♪

01:34.678 --> 01:37.639
You should come to Barrel's
tomorrow night.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.725
-We'll get hammered.
-Oh, my God!

01:39.725 --> 01:43.186
Do you ever remember anything?
I got a field trip to Boston!

01:43.186 --> 01:45.313
-I got Celtics tickets.
-Mmmm! Right.

01:45.313 --> 01:48.067
-Yeah, remember? You're coming.
-Right, senior class trip.

01:48.067 --> 01:50.277
Thank you. Saved you
a seat on the bus.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.196
No! I am not taking a bus
with a bunch of high
school kids. I'll fly.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.407
-How can you afford to fly?
-I know a flight attendant.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.492
Just give me my ticket,
I'll meet you at the game.

01:57.492 --> 02:00.871
-All right, Celtics! Larry Bird.
-Yeah! This is gonna be great.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.748
Although, we could have gone
to Boston on our own time.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.124
We didn't have to make it like a
field trip with kids.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.877
You're not thinking.
My trip is free.

02:06.877 --> 02:10.130
The school's paying for me
to go to a Celtics game
in Boston.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.759
Free bus, free hotel,
it's like a paid vacation.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.970
-Sweet man! You get a per diem?
-A what?

02:15.970 --> 02:18.513
-Like a stipend.
-Is everything a joke to you?

02:18.513 --> 02:20.307
I gotta go.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.184
-Hey Simon.
-Hey.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.270
I have a huge favor
to ask you.

02:25.270 --> 02:28.189
-Anything, literally anything.
-Oh, great.

02:28.189 --> 02:31.986
Um, I'm having a really hard
time getting my grades into
the marking software.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.863
-Could you help me
out with that?
-Sure, yeah. How about tonight?

02:34.863 --> 02:37.449
Not tonight, I can't.
Ah, tomorrow?

02:37.449 --> 02:39.910
Oh, I'm going on the overnight
with Gerry.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.079
[whispers] He got us both
tickets to the Celtics game.

02:42.079 --> 02:45.165
-Oh! Wow! That...
-[whispers] Don't tell her.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.918
-That sounds really wrong.
-It is, yeah.

02:47.918 --> 02:50.879
-Anyway, I wish I could help
you with this.
-It's okay.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.714
-If I'd known sooner.
-Yeah don't worry about it.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.675
-[Simon] See ya. Okay.
-I'll figure something out.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.885
Wow, you dodged a
bullet there. Huh?

02:56.885 --> 02:59.972
He has the big old crush
on you, you would have
been there all night.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.807
That's not a crush.
That's just Simon.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.976
Oh, right.

03:03.976 --> 03:07.186
Well don't be surprised when he
shows up with your name tattooed
on his neck.

03:07.186 --> 03:09.898
I don't think that's what
happens when someone has
a crush.

03:09.898 --> 03:15.070
It does in my world.
Weird little fellow, isn't he?

03:15.070 --> 03:19.158
Mr. Duncan. Can we have a word
about this Boston itinerary?

03:19.158 --> 03:21.994
What's ah...
What's wrong with it?

03:21.994 --> 03:25.747
Well, how can I put this?
I'm so insanely jealous
I want to cut your brake lines

03:25.747 --> 03:27.916
and watch you perish at the
bottom of a ravine so deep

03:27.916 --> 03:30.044
no one can even hear
your cries for help.

03:30.044 --> 03:32.838
-Don't be jealous.
-I love this itinerary Gerry.

03:32.838 --> 03:35.841
-Kennedy museum, have you been?
-No. Looking forward to it.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.885
-The Kennedy's are like
Boston's royal family.
-Yeah.

03:37.885 --> 03:42.347
When JFK Jr. died it was
such a waste of handsome.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.933
All right, I gotta go to class.
Glad you like it.

03:44.933 --> 03:48.979
Uh, Gerry? I did notice one
minor detail.

03:48.979 --> 03:53.483
You've only allotted 15 minutes
to get from the Science Museum
to the Kennedy Museum.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.611
Boston traffic,
it's not going to happen.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.530
Oversight. So, I'll fix that.

03:58.530 --> 04:02.242
And I'm going to bring
you back a t-shirt from
the Kennedy Museum.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.785
-No way.
-Yeah.

04:03.785 --> 04:07.497
Ich bin ein grateful, Gerry.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.750
-Great.
-It's what Kennedy said.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.293
Whatever that means.

04:12.293 --> 04:15.756
I'm still missing some
permission forms for
the Boston trip.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.508
-Can I get those please.
-Sir, why Boston?

04:18.508 --> 04:20.135
Why do you have questions
all the time?

04:20.135 --> 04:21.720
Boston!
It's a history course.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.638
Do you know how much history
took place in Boston?

04:23.638 --> 04:25.766
First marathon, Boston!

04:25.766 --> 04:27.768
Won by a Kenyan,
maybe on a school trip.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.728
Maya, maybe you'll win
the marathon.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.856
Sir, it's called a marathon,
because the first marathon

04:32.856 --> 04:34.900
was run in Marathon, Greece.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.863
Are you listening to this?
Marathon, Greece?

04:39.863 --> 04:42.532
-[Maya] Yeah.
-Is that right next
to the city 10-K?

04:42.532 --> 04:45.285
[class laughs]

04:45.285 --> 04:47.204
What about Montreal? Or Ottawa?

04:47.204 --> 04:49.248
Yeah, why don't we go there
Ben, so you can get wasted.

04:49.248 --> 04:52.751
You think I'm stupid? Sneak over
to Hull? To Les Dancers?

04:52.751 --> 04:55.212
Is that what you want?
Go see Les Dancers? Huh?

04:55.212 --> 04:57.256
I know what happens
on these overnight trips.

04:57.256 --> 04:59.507
We are going to the
United States of America.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.384
Because you need
to be 21 to drink.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.596
Which means none of you can
drink on this field trip.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.640
Although, Jimmy, you keep
failing this class...

05:06.640 --> 05:08.683
You're going to be
21 pretty soon.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.727
-[class laughs]
-That's not funny.

05:10.727 --> 05:14.898
It was funny, it was very funny.
I thought it was funny.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.733
All right, we'll get the kids
back to the hotel.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.359
I'll pay a security guard
to watch them...

05:18.359 --> 05:19.861
And then we'll go to a
Celtics game!

05:19.861 --> 05:22.781
No, come here Simon.
Look, you don't understand.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.742
We don't go to a Celtics game.
I'm going to a Celtics game.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.245
Not alone you're not. Boston
can be a dangerous city Gerry.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.830
I'm not going alone,
I'm going with a friend.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.790
Ohhh, thanks.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.293
Simon, my friend Bill
is who I'm going with.

05:34.293 --> 05:36.795
-What? I thought
we were friends.
-I've told you this before.

05:36.795 --> 05:40.048
I have friends and I have work
friends. You fall somewhere
outside of that.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.926
But the whole point
of this trip was to
go to a Celtics game.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.427
And I'm going to a Celtics game,
but with Bill.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.096
What's all this Bill stuff
I keep hearing about?

05:46.096 --> 05:48.140
-Is there something
going on with you two?
-No!

05:48.140 --> 05:49.183
Because I'm hearing
a lot about you and Bill.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.018
-We're Celtics fans.
-I like the Celtics.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.103
I'll tell you what, name
five players and you can come.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.229
-You got it!
-Go!

05:54.229 --> 05:57.607
Juon... Jamille...

05:57.607 --> 06:00.986
-Otis. Can't do it!
-No you can't, that's why
you're not coming.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.696
No, you know what?
Ultimatum time.

06:02.696 --> 06:06.449
-You take me to that
Celtics game, or else!
-Or else what?

06:06.449 --> 06:10.912
-I cancelled my trip to Boston.
-You didn't do that for me,
did you?

06:10.912 --> 06:13.623
-What if I did?
-Oh Simon, I don't think that...

06:13.623 --> 06:16.877
Ssshhh! What's done is done.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.087
Now I can help you with
your marking software.

06:19.087 --> 06:23.717
Okay. Okay, but that is
what this is about right?

06:23.717 --> 06:26.053
Yeah, what else
would it be about?

06:26.053 --> 06:27.846
Exactly!

06:27.846 --> 06:31.766
Me and you putting everything
inside my brain into your brain.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.768
Right, right.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.812
We're going to put a little
Simon inside you.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.773
Oh, God.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.525
No, Duncan, if you're gonna
take that many students

06:40.525 --> 06:43.278
on an overnight trip, you have
to have two teachers.

06:43.278 --> 06:46.240
I can handle
that many kids myself.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.242
Fine, I'll go find another
teacher right now.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.577
Well, you better get on it,
otherwise you have to cancel.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.996
Cancel what? Boston? Why?

06:52.996 --> 06:55.582
-Simon's out.
-I'll go.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.876
Thank you Robert, that's nice,
but I'm going to get another
teacher.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.711
That doesn't make sense. You're
going to get another teacher?

06:59.711 --> 07:02.381
Then you're going to need a sub
to cover off that teacher.
I'm available.

07:02.381 --> 07:06.134
Robert, you know as well as
I do, vice principals do not
go on overnight trips.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.136
-Exactly, so see you later.
-Just... It's...

07:08.136 --> 07:10.555
Unless they bring me back
a Harvard hoodie.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.516
-[Gerry quietly] Oh, boy.
-Eh oh! Huh?

07:13.516 --> 07:15.727
-I'm going to Boston, with you.
-All right.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.479
I'm gonna get some clam chowda!

07:18.479 --> 07:20.899
-Okay, thank you Robert.
-Yeah.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.452
Welcome to Harvard University.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.079
One of the best schools
in the world.

07:34.079 --> 07:37.540
I almost went here. Actually.
So it's nice to be here.

07:37.540 --> 07:43.422
And this is Mr. John Hancock,
who is an alumni of Harvard.

07:43.422 --> 07:48.551
And also signed the... anyone?
The Magna Carta.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.178
He signed the Declaration
of Independence.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.430
Yes! Sorry.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.848
Maya's right,
I always mix those two up.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.726
They are so close together
that I always confuse them.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.187
-So why is it called Harvard?
-Good question Jimmy.

07:59.187 --> 08:03.775
Harvard is called Harvard
because it comes from the Latin
term vard which means very.

08:03.775 --> 08:07.528
And the English term hard,
so they got Hard Vard.

08:07.528 --> 08:12.159
And that is pretty much when
Harvard blended into that.

08:12.159 --> 08:16.788
It's also a very hard school
to get into so Hard Vard
makes perfect sense.

08:16.788 --> 08:20.459
It was named after its first
benefactor, sir.

08:20.459 --> 08:25.505
-John Harvard.
-So, let us move on.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.966
Let's head out.
That was fun.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.635
You're welcome, Sir Hancock.

08:30.635 --> 08:34.597
-Move on? Not from Harvard.
The tour's not over.
-What?

08:34.597 --> 08:36.891
It doesn't say 'A tour of a
statue', it says 'A tour of
Harvard'.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.727
-We didn't even go inside.
-Yeah, that's all
they'd let me do.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.980
-Did you even ask if we
could go inside?
-Haha, nice.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.815
Yeah, it was a lot of
phone calls, e-mails.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.067
I thought we were going to
audit a class, it's a
learn-cation.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.944
It's very hard to get
into this school academically

08:47.944 --> 08:49.696
and it's very hard
to get in physically.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.698
You can't just wander around
Harvard, Robert.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.658
I find that vard hard
to believe Gerry.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.869
Vard hard? Good one,
that's good. Yeah.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.246
Yeah, Magna Carta.
Try to keep your facts straight.

08:58.246 --> 09:03.001
Like you don't mix
those two up. Everybody does.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.966
[Robert] Mr. Duncan, I'm
looking for filthy alley on this
itinerary, yet I don't see it.

09:09.966 --> 09:13.345
Mr. Cheeley, I don't live
in Boston so perhaps I'm
a little lost.

09:13.345 --> 09:17.098
But I promise, I will get
us back to the hotel
through the alley, okay?

09:17.098 --> 09:18.558
Wait, back to
the hotel already?

09:18.558 --> 09:21.769
We've been wandering aimlessly
for hours and we're already
going back to the hotel?

09:21.769 --> 09:24.605
That is sightseeing which
is on the itinerary.

09:24.605 --> 09:27.108
-This trip's
kind of boring, sir.
-What? Ben, you're boring.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.319
I don't know why I let you come
on this trip, to be honest.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.071
-When are we going to
do something fun?
-Fun Maya?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.073
This is a field trip,
this is educational.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.200
This isn't for your
amusement or your fun.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.535
You kids want to buy some dope?

09:38.619 --> 09:42.707
Oh, my God. Let's go.
I will show you fun, all right?

09:42.707 --> 09:47.337
I will tell you we are going to
the next, it's four o'clock.

09:47.337 --> 09:52.050
It's four o'clock now, which
means, the next time I will see
you is breakfast at 9:00am.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.843
Because, you have some
free time.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.555
Sir, what are we going to do
with 17 hours of free time?

09:56.555 --> 10:00.100
I don't know but you're in high
school, you're in Boston,
have fun, maybe?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.810
Just get out of my face, I don't
want to see you for 17 hours.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.563
Go, stay out of trouble.
Don't get arrested.

10:04.563 --> 10:07.232
Don't do anything stupid.
I'll see you at 9:00am
for breakfast.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.443
-Huh?
-Mr. Duncan?

10:09.443 --> 10:12.904
-What?
-Just come clean. This entire
trip's been a sham.

10:12.904 --> 10:15.698
Not a sham. There's an
itinerary and I have
followed everything.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.784
We didn't even stop
at the Kennedy Museum.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.703
It doesn't say stop, it says we
will see the Kennedy Museum.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.205
And we saw it when we drove by.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.706
I did not fall off a turnip
truck yesterday.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.750
Just come clean.
Just tell me the truth.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.628
When saws the last time you had
fun, Robert? Never.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.631
-[Cell phone sounds]
-We're going to have fun.
I gotta take this call.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.468
-Hey, make it quick Bill.
-[girls cheer]

10:34.468 --> 10:36.677
Hey, I need a wing man.
I'm at a bar near the arena.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.597
Come grab some drinks
before the game.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.265
I'm trying to get there
but I got kids here.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.683
Hurry up man, things just got
kind of interesting over here.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.770
-I'm trying to get Robert
off my back.
-Yeah.

10:45.770 --> 10:49.190
Okay, I gotta go Robert.
9:00am breakfast.

10:49.190 --> 10:53.153
-You want to buy some dope?
-Do you want to buy some soap?

10:55.363 --> 10:57.532
-[music playing at bar]
-Ladies.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.367
Bachelorette parties
are all about regret right?

10:59.367 --> 11:01.035
[women cheer]

11:09.752 --> 11:11.754
Everything okay?

11:11.754 --> 11:15.674
-Yeah, you just gave up
a lot to be here, and...
-[Simon] Ohhh.

11:15.674 --> 11:18.512
I just don't want to give you
the wrong impression.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.473
Oh no, no, it's just friends
helping friends. That's what
friends are for.

11:21.473 --> 11:24.142
Friends! Right, good
friends even.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.103
-Friends with benefits.
-[Lisa sighs]

11:27.103 --> 11:31.941
Look, I think you're a really,
really nice guy, and...

11:31.941 --> 11:35.820
I'm just not feeling that
way about you. You know?

11:35.820 --> 11:39.157
And it's not that I'm not
attracted to nice guys.

11:39.157 --> 11:43.286
It's just kind of, we work
together and I'm just not...

11:43.286 --> 11:45.830
Okay, wait what? Um, hold up.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.542
Lisa, what in the name
of everything are you
talking about?

11:48.542 --> 11:52.462
Simon, you gave up your trip
to Boston to get close to me.

11:52.462 --> 11:57.342
Uh, no, I gave up my trip to
Boston because Gerry wouldn't
take me to a Celtics game.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.221
-Oh.
-Yeah.

12:04.265 --> 12:09.812
Ha, wow, that Gerry
can be such a jerk huh?

12:10.938 --> 12:14.234
-Simon, I'm sorry.
-Don't be sorry.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.612
You made it perfectly clear that
someone like you could never
like someone like me.

12:17.612 --> 12:20.490
Clearly the fact that you
look like my mom means
nothing to you.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.577
-Ew.
-And I know that I don't have
the things women look for.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.705
I don't have fancy,
expensive clothes

12:26.705 --> 12:30.584
or a fat wallet
full of greenbacks.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.920
And I know that I have the
physique of a tall child.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.423
I know that my list of fears
is abnormally long.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.634
The fear that I'll wake up
with strange, new allergies.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.678
Hay fever 2.0, haunting.

12:41.678 --> 12:46.015
I'll have you know, I am
perfectly capable of
looking past...

12:46.015 --> 12:48.727
-Most of that stuff.
-I call bogus.

12:48.727 --> 12:52.272
-It is not bogus.
-Barrel's, dinner, right now.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.274
-You're driving.
-I'll get my jacket.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.859
-I'll get in your car.
-Fine.

12:56.859 --> 13:00.779
-I'm parked in the back of...
-I know where you're parked.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.714
No, no. Get out of here, get
out of here. Get out of here.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.258
-[knocks again]
-Mr. Duncan, I know you're in
there, I can hear you.

13:20.258 --> 13:24.721
-Hey! I was just gonna
go to bed. What's up?
-You know what?

13:24.721 --> 13:27.432
I've been thinking a lot about
what you said about me needing
to lighten up.

13:27.432 --> 13:32.103
And have some fun, and it's
rare, but you're right.

13:32.103 --> 13:36.232
-So you should go do that. Okay?
-Oh, not so fast party pooper.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.859
-I brought a friend.
-Tequila, I don't do tequila.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.904
Oh! Tonight you do. You know
what they say about tequila?

13:41.904 --> 13:46.576
There's a U and I right inside.
Side by side. One quick drink.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.369
Okay, quick.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.625
Wanna play a drinking game?

13:53.625 --> 13:57.003
It's easy, when I say drink,
you drink. Okay?

13:57.003 --> 13:59.506
-How is that a drinking game?
-Drink!

13:59.506 --> 14:01.840
-I don't want to play this game.
-Drink!

14:01.840 --> 14:04.885
No.

14:04.885 --> 14:08.222
One, nothing. It's okay,
you're just learning.

14:08.222 --> 14:12.268
How is this a drinking game
for you? You just say drink
and that's the game?

14:12.268 --> 14:14.937
Because it's your turn now.
You say drink, and I'll drink.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.567
-Drink.

14:19.567 --> 14:23.863
Early lead. I am kicking
your a-double-s.

-Who's that?

14:27.617 --> 14:30.036
-Drink.

-[Gerry] How's the game?
-Total snooze fest.

14:34.582 --> 14:38.211
But don't' worry, I found this
bachelorette party that wants
to keep partying with us!

14:38.211 --> 14:40.213
A stagette at the Celtics game?
That's weird.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.716
-Are you coming or what?
-I can't, I got Robert...

14:42.716 --> 14:45.051
-Robert's in my room right now.
-So?

14:45.051 --> 14:47.512
So, he's already onto me and
now he wants to bond.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.639
If I leave now he's
gonna suspect something.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.225
-Man, you gotta get rid of him.
-No kidding, idiot.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.686
I'll text you when I'm on my
way. I'll be there.

14:54.686 --> 14:58.523
All right man, whatever.
Last night of freedom right?

14:58.523 --> 15:01.025
Well that was fun Robert, let's
call it a night. Thank you.

15:01.025 --> 15:05.530
Or, we should probably call
Callaghan too and tell him about
your little educational trip.

15:05.530 --> 15:10.702
Or, we should strap on a helmet
and drink through it, soldier.

15:10.702 --> 15:13.913
-Drink!
-I'll just drink.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.916
Someone over here's getting
a little parched.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.918
Drink.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.262
[sighs]

15:29.262 --> 15:33.892
Mr. Walrus wants to... drink

15:33.892 --> 15:36.519
You gotta slow down Robert.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.855
Let's go out.

15:38.855 --> 15:43.317
All right, let's just go.
Let's just go get on the bus.

15:43.317 --> 15:48.030
And let's just go to Mexico or
somewhere, Costa Rica or
Louisiana and let's teach.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.909
Hey. You know my friend Bill?

15:50.909 --> 15:53.620
Uh, yeah. I know
your friend Bill.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.331
Well he's here in Boston
with a bunch of girls right now.

15:57.331 --> 16:00.460
-Let's go, let's go meet them.
-Then what are we doing
sitting here?

16:00.460 --> 16:03.922
Stop drinking, though.
I'm too tired for this.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.758
It looks like it's ringing.
Drink!

16:08.509 --> 16:11.304
So, since the brain process
is faster than real time,

16:11.304 --> 16:13.640
we're living 80 milliseconds
in the future.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.683
Simon, that is so fascinating.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.727
I hope to discover something
like that someday.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.730
Be the next Einstein.
Sounds crazy, right?

16:20.730 --> 16:23.566
No, not at all, anyone could
be the next Einstein.

16:23.566 --> 16:26.694
-In fact, he actually made
a lot of mistakes.
-I'm sorry, what?

16:26.694 --> 16:29.781
Oh, there have been a lot of
scientists that have found some
big holes in his theories.

16:29.781 --> 16:32.659
Well, I don't know who
these people are, but,

16:32.659 --> 16:35.578
the only holes in Einstein's
theory's are black.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.747
Black holes, so...

16:37.747 --> 16:39.791
I'm just saying that you
could be the next Einstein,

16:39.791 --> 16:41.000
only without mistakes.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.794
You better watch your mouth.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.755
I didn't mean to offend you.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.092
I think we should see
other people.

Okay. I didn't realize
we were...

-Yeah, yeah sure.

-Thank you.
-Yeah.

ya? Boy, you cannot handle
your booze.

even handle it.

17:11.698 --> 17:15.451
Oh, look who it is.
Past curfew isn't it?

17:15.451 --> 17:17.954

in your rooms, what's going
on here?

17:17.954 --> 17:20.790
And! You're supposed
to be in your rooms.

17:20.790 --> 17:24.210
-Are you guys drunk?
-We'll ask the questions
here you little...

17:24.210 --> 17:26.504
Don't say it, don't say it.
Think it, but don't say it.

17:26.504 --> 17:30.550
I think you guys have been
drinking, I smell booze
on all your faces.

17:30.550 --> 17:34.136
I see booze on your jacket.

17:34.136 --> 17:37.891
[Gerry] Oh, nice. I guess
someone's parents will be
getting a phone call.

17:37.891 --> 17:42.729
Nice one. The Cheelster! Ha!

17:42.729 --> 17:44.480
-This is despicable.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.649
We try to take you
away on a nice trip,

17:46.649 --> 17:49.027
this is worse than
a slap in the face.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.988
-Worse then a slap in the face?
-Well, maybe you've never had
a slap in the face.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.323
Maybe I'll give you a slap in
the face and you'll know what it
feels like on your face.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.867
-[Gerry] Whoa, whoa.
-Can't hit students.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.577
Teacher's can't
hit kids anymore,

17:57.577 --> 17:58.494
they took that away from us.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.581
I'll bring it back right now.
With one slap to the face!

18:01.581 --> 18:03.165
Drop the mitts Big Country.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.751
Well, why do you
smell like a brewery?

18:04.751 --> 18:07.086
Why do you smell like kitten
breath and chamomile?

18:07.086 --> 18:11.131
Okay, we are in charge
here now Maya. Me and
Roberto had a drink.

18:11.131 --> 18:14.052
-We're adults Maya.
-Grown-ass adults.

18:14.052 --> 18:17.096
-Okay? Settle down.
-We can hold our liquor.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.599
[Robert] Oh, dear.

18:19.599 --> 18:23.436
Ahh, oh, no. You got
it on Callaghan's...oh no.

18:23.436 --> 18:27.398
[laughing] You got it on
Callaghan's sweatshirt!

18:27.398 --> 18:29.943
-Don't make it a thing.
-[Gerry] You got it all over.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.028
- Oh, my...!
- [exclaiming]

18:32.028 --> 18:36.323
-[Maya] Eww!
-[Gerry laughs]

18:36.323 --> 18:38.409
-[Gerry dry heaves]
-[Maya] That is so gross.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.494
-We have to go.
-[Gerry] Oh, my God!
I looked at it.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.789
I just have to change my shoes
and then we'll go.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.791
-[Gerry] Don't slip, don't
slip. Careful.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.293
-Hold me Robert.
-Were still gonna meet those
girls, right?

18:47.293 --> 18:50.421
-[Gerry on phone] Yeah, I'm
not gonna make it Bill.
-Are you sure?

18:50.421 --> 18:53.466
[Robert] Gerry, I really think
I need to go to the hospital.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.676
Yeah, I can't leave him
like this.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.971
-That sucks buddy.
-Thanks.

18:57.971 --> 19:01.432
[Robert vomits]
Look, I don't remember
eating any of this.

19:01.432 --> 19:04.435
Plank salmon and corn niblets.

19:04.435 --> 19:08.064
-[Gerry] Oh, Robert,
some field trip.
-[Robert vomits]

19:08.064 --> 19:11.859
-How ya feeling?
-Pretty good.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.862
-Okay, you hungry?
-A little bit.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.447
I got some clam chowder
in my bag.

19:16.447 --> 19:19.117
Not for that, not for that.
I'm not hungry for that.

19:19.117 --> 19:23.370
All right, here's the deal.
This is our story.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.165
Mr. Cheeley ate some bad shrimp
and that is why he threw up.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.127
And that is the story we go with
when we get back to the school.

19:29.127 --> 19:31.629
-Well what did you eat?
-What do you mean what
did I eat Ben?

19:31.629 --> 19:35.382
I didn't eat anything and I
didn't throw up. This has got
nothing to do with me. Okay?

19:35.382 --> 19:37.135
So you're not gonna
tell our parents?

19:37.135 --> 19:38.970
No Maya, I'm not going to tell
your parents

19:38.970 --> 19:40.805
that you went on a field trip
and you got drunk.

19:40.805 --> 19:44.642
And if he tells our parents
about us we tell Callaghan
about him.

19:44.642 --> 19:47.478
-You know, I wish I could leave
you here in Boston.
-You can't.

19:47.478 --> 19:52.358
All right, listen up please!
Mr. Cheeley is not feeling well!

19:52.358 --> 19:54.735
He ate some bad shrimp.

19:54.735 --> 19:58.739
So! We will not be noisy
on the bus ride home!

19:58.739 --> 20:01.241
Mr. Cheeley has
some food poisoning!

20:01.241 --> 20:04.037
So we will keep it down for him!

20:04.037 --> 20:09.167
I do not want to have to talk
to anybody while we go home!

20:09.167 --> 20:11.293
I want it nice and quiet!

20:11.293 --> 20:14.338
[Yells] You do not
want to see me angry.

20:19.177 --> 20:22.889
-The kids can't tell right?
-No. I covered for you.

20:22.889 --> 20:29.228
-You owe me! Big time.
-Last night was epic!

20:29.228 --> 20:31.522
-That's not epic.
-How are we gonna top that?

20:31.522 --> 20:35.860
-I got your back next time.
-There won't be a next time.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.738
-What do you want?
-Take my hand.

20:40.114 --> 20:43.325
Okay, that's great.

20:43.325 --> 20:46.328
Robert, the kids are still
watching. You're still drunk.

20:52.334 --> 20:55.254
-He threw up a lot!
-That's awesome.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.381
How were those girls?
Be honest.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.884
First we started dinner, it was
nice, a little bit of wine.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.928
Then they went out of control!

21:01.928 --> 21:05.639
We hit the bar and it was shots
and round, round, round.

21:05.639 --> 21:08.976
We're doing like beer pong,
it was like we were going crazy!
Like, they were nuts.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.229
They were drinking like
they were going to prison
the next day.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.814
-It was amazing!
-You didn't go to the game.

21:13.814 --> 21:17.151
Pff! No.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.778
Potato. Fries. Salt and pepper.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.781
♪ Awesome, awesome
awesome, awesome ♪
