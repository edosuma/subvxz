<i>Henry Deaver is in town.</i>

00:07.132 --> 00:09.468
‐ So?
‐ Oh, please,

00:09.468 --> 00:12.012
Ms. Pre‐teen Voyeur 1991.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.473
<i>Apparently he’s a lawyer.</i>

00:14.473 --> 00:16.558
I wish I could help you find
your client, Mr. Deaver.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.435
I can’t very well
call up a ghost.

00:21.230 --> 00:24.691
‐ Got a condition.
‐ Forty gets you eight fives.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.485
<i>You know, the best cure</i>

00:26.485 --> 00:28.987
for social anxiety? Sunlight.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.656
Well, I don’t have
social anxiety.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.950
Right. Your...

00:32.950 --> 00:34.868
undiagnosed psychic affliction.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.162
<i>There are nerves in the brain,</i>

00:37.162 --> 00:38.872
<i>they’re called mirror neurons.</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:40.749
<i>And they’re responsible</i>
<i>for empathy.</i>

00:40.749 --> 00:43.794
‐ Are you high?
‐ What? No.

00:43.794 --> 00:46.004
<i>I take half a pill</i>
<i>once a day</i>

00:46.004 --> 00:49.258
just to muffle
other people’s noise.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.301
‐ You’re Henry Deaver, right?
‐ Excuse me?

00:51.301 --> 00:52.761
Beloved local preacher

00:52.761 --> 00:54.429
<i>opens his home and his heart</i>

00:54.429 --> 00:55.973
<i>to poor screw‐up orphan.</i>

00:55.973 --> 00:57.391
<i>You lure him out</i>
<i>to Castle Lake,</i>

00:57.391 --> 00:59.184
<i>push him off the rocks‐‐</i>

00:59.184 --> 01:01.562
bye‐bye, Pastor Deaver.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.438
He died at home,
not at the lake.

01:04.438 --> 01:07.359
<i>Six days into the search,</i>

01:07.359 --> 01:09.486
<i>authorities are increasingly</i>
<i>doubtful</i>

01:09.486 --> 01:12.322
<i>that the 11‐year‐old Deaver boy</i>
<i>will be found alive.</i>

01:12.322 --> 01:14.867
<i>His father, Matthew Deaver,</i>

06:13.916 --> 06:15.000
Why?

06:17.127 --> 06:19.004
I was saved.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.674
My body fell to earth,

06:22.674 --> 06:25.636
my bones were broken,

06:25.636 --> 06:28.472
but I asked my Lord for mercy
and He saved me.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.352
Who are you
to overrule the will

06:33.352 --> 06:34.937
of my Lord?

06:40.108 --> 06:42.110
Friends.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.447
We have let a sinner
into our house.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.037
Behold, I will tell you
a mystery.

06:53.664 --> 06:56.542
Not all will sleep,
but all will be chained

06:56.542 --> 06:59.336
in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye,

06:59.336 --> 07:01.129
at the last trumpet,

07:01.129 --> 07:04.675
for the trumpet will sound
and the dead will be raised,

07:04.675 --> 07:07.845
imperishable,
and we will all be changed!

08:28.425 --> 08:30.135
<i>Local coverage</i>
<i>is what we give you,</i>

08:30.135 --> 08:31.929
<i>it’s what we are.</i>

08:31.929 --> 08:33.304
<i>We’re on the scene</i>
<i>delivering the news</i>

08:33.304 --> 08:34.515
<i>when it happens, as it happens.</i>

08:34.515 --> 08:36.183
<i>We bring you right up close</i>

08:36.183 --> 08:38.227
<i>to events,</i>
<i>local politics and more.</i>

08:38.227 --> 08:40.062
<i>Not to mention</i>
<i>the fast‐changing foliage</i>

08:40.062 --> 08:41.647
- ‐ <i>of the county...</i>
- I can’t believe

08:41.647 --> 08:44.358
you’re going to be
on the show tomorrow.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.026
It’s absurd.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.905
‐ Stay glued.
‐ What is that?

08:49.905 --> 08:53.075
‐ It is a gazebo.
Every revitalized downtown

08:53.075 --> 08:54.868
needs a gazebo.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.746
‐ What’s it for?
‐ I don’t know.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.581
Peaceful contemplation.

08:59.581 --> 09:00.707
The only thing people
contemplate

09:00.707 --> 09:02.292
in this town is suicide.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.878
That’s because
there’s no job base

09:04.878 --> 09:06.421
if you don’t want
to work in a prison.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.173
There’s no local business hub

09:08.173 --> 09:11.343
to encourage social and economic
cross‐pollination.

09:11.343 --> 09:14.805
‐ Yet. That’s phase one.
‐ Wow.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.099
You’re not gonna
say that on TV, right?

09:17.099 --> 09:20.018
‐ What?
‐ Nothing, it’s just that

09:20.018 --> 09:22.396
the camera guy’s
gonna slip into a coma

09:22.396 --> 09:24.565
before you hit phase two.

09:29.361 --> 09:32.072
So, what happens
when I get there?

09:32.072 --> 09:34.658
I just tell ’em
I’m your intern?

09:34.658 --> 09:37.244
Say "executive assistant."

09:40.330 --> 09:42.332
The producer’s name
is Charlene.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.793
She’s gonna meet you
outside the studio.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.212
Please, just try
to avoid potholes.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.923
Why do you care what happens
to this hellscape, anyway?

09:51.633 --> 09:52.885
Just keep it under 40.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.663
Molly Strand.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.210
‐ Yes.
‐ It’s Henry Deaver.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.753
North Prospect?

10:27.753 --> 10:29.922
We were neighbors
back in dinosaur times?

10:29.922 --> 10:33.175
Of course. Henry.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.302
Sorry. I didn’t, um...

10:36.762 --> 10:38.931
‐ It’s been‐‐
‐ A lot of years.

10:38.931 --> 10:40.182
Yeah, I don’t get back much.

10:42.184 --> 10:45.145
Why are‐‐
What are you doing here?

10:45.145 --> 10:46.980
I have a client
over at the prison.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.983
- ‐ A real mess.
<i>- Smells like Cheerios.</i>

10:49.983 --> 10:51.860
<i>Gene Pitney,</i>
<i>"24 Hours From Tulsa."</i>

10:51.860 --> 10:54.238
<i>Does the tape get erased?</i>

10:54.238 --> 10:56.240
<i>Hey, I’m her witness!</i>

10:56.240 --> 10:57.199
Good luck.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.787
Sorry, that was...

11:01.787 --> 11:04.331
Um, yeah,

11:04.331 --> 11:08.210
I would love
to...hear more,

11:08.210 --> 11:11.421
but I have, um,

11:11.421 --> 11:13.048
I have an open house.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.925
Actually,
that’s why I’m here.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.844
I’ve been seeing your signs
all around town.

11:16.844 --> 11:20.264
You want to sell
your mom’s place?

11:20.264 --> 11:24.309
<i>Do you know Alan Pangborn?</i>

11:24.309 --> 11:27.271
‐ ...she needs full‐time care.
‐ Isn’t Sheriff Pangborn‐‐

11:27.271 --> 11:29.398
We’re making some changes.

11:29.398 --> 11:32.568
Um......

11:32.568 --> 11:35.529
‐ I can’t help you.
‐ I’m sorry?

11:37.239 --> 11:41.577
I am‐‐ I’m just
so...overwhelmed here,

11:41.577 --> 11:44.746
I can’t take a new client.

11:44.746 --> 11:48.667
Also, with my parents’ house
being directly across the street

11:48.667 --> 11:51.044
it’s probably
a conflict of interest.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.089
So, um, I can refer you
to someone else.

11:54.089 --> 11:57.843
N‐No. No, I’ll just‐‐

12:06.059 --> 12:08.437
Did I say something wrong?

12:08.437 --> 12:11.106
No. Of course not. You‐‐

12:15.319 --> 12:17.571
It was really good
seeing you.

12:22.701 --> 12:23.994
You too.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.806
Fuck you, Dad.

12:53.232 --> 12:54.316
Hey.

13:03.492 --> 13:06.078
You wanna see my room?

13:06.078 --> 13:08.163
It’s a lot cooler
than it used to be.

13:11.959 --> 13:15.420
I go
to Catholic school now.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.090
‐ My dad made me.
‐ I know.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.391
What are Violent Femmes?

13:27.391 --> 13:29.768
A band.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.979
"Femme" is a girl.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.355
In French.

13:37.234 --> 13:40.404
You know, he’s...

13:40.404 --> 13:42.406
not my real father.

13:42.406 --> 13:44.491
Obviously.

13:46.410 --> 13:48.412
Yeah.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.083
I know what you do
in your room.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.670
Touching your thing.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.757
Feels like...

14:00.757 --> 14:02.467
fireworks.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.971
‐ I ain’t never‐‐
‐ I can’t explain it, but...

14:05.971 --> 14:09.308
I can hear what you’re thinking
and feeling.

14:09.308 --> 14:11.101
When you’re brushing your teeth,

14:11.101 --> 14:12.769
and when
you’re out in the woods,

14:12.769 --> 14:14.813
it’s like
I’m out there with you.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.483
<i>Henry!</i>

14:22.112 --> 14:23.655
<i>Henry, where’d you go?</i>

14:25.490 --> 14:28.744
Son, I want you
back in this house right now.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.833
Henry!

15:01.318 --> 15:04.029
<i>C block,</i>
<i>count time in 30 minutes.</i>

15:30.430 --> 15:32.307
<i>You tell Valerie yet?</i>

15:32.307 --> 15:34.268
<i>Fuck no, I didn’t</i>
<i>tell her about the money.</i>

15:34.268 --> 15:35.894
She’d blow it
on the mortgage.

15:35.894 --> 15:39.731
I’m buyin’ an Xbox
and a pound of weed.

15:39.731 --> 15:43.068
You gonna spend your bonus on
fuckin’ Fischer‐Price Jumperoo?

15:43.068 --> 15:44.903
It’s not a bonus,
it’s a bribe.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.363
So they don’t talk.

15:47.698 --> 15:49.032
About what?

15:51.201 --> 15:52.369
Hey.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.580
Hey! Mickey boy!

15:54.580 --> 15:56.415
‐ Sit the fuck down!
‐ Hey.

15:56.415 --> 15:58.000
You better sit down.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.459
Hey! Sit down!

16:02.212 --> 16:03.505
Sit down.

16:12.222 --> 16:15.100
Look, he’s scheduled a hearing,
he’s gonna get you out,

16:15.100 --> 16:16.977
but you gotta help yourself.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.606
Come on, sit down.

16:25.444 --> 16:29.323
<i>Dude doesn’t eat,</i>
<i>except for Wonder Bread.</i>

16:29.323 --> 16:30.908
Barely sleeps.

16:30.908 --> 16:34.328
Just kinda walks
in these little circles.

16:34.328 --> 16:37.080
Guys watch him on CCTV now.
Nick at Nite.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.459
Some of the COs
call him Nick now.

16:40.459 --> 16:43.128
Like Nick Cage, ’cause
we found him in a cage‐‐

16:43.128 --> 16:44.588
I get it.
‐ Yeah.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.340
Look, I can pull
the security footage.

16:46.340 --> 16:48.091
All right? That would
look real good on CNN.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.593
Let’s hold off on that.

16:49.593 --> 16:51.929
Listen, you gotta
earn his trust.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.931
Get him to tell you
how he got there.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.724
I know how he got there.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.936
Shoulda seen him eye‐fucking
Warden Lacy’s picture.

16:58.936 --> 17:01.772
Nah. I need more.

17:01.772 --> 17:04.525
You gotta tell him,
all right?

17:04.525 --> 17:06.151
<i>Onus probandi,</i> right?

17:06.151 --> 17:08.403
Burden of proof.

17:08.403 --> 17:10.989
Oh, just Wikipedia.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.535
Funny, man, you work
in law enforcement,

17:14.535 --> 17:16.703
nobody knows shit
about the law.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.997
Hey, how long does it take
to become a lawyer, anyway?

17:18.997 --> 17:21.415
I was thinkin’...
I don’t know,

17:21.415 --> 17:23.335
maybe when all this is done,
I go back to school.

17:23.335 --> 17:26.296
You can write me, like,
a recommendation or somethin’.

17:29.675 --> 17:32.553
Uh...yeah. Sure thing.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.304
What the fuck?

18:18.724 --> 18:20.976
Ohh. Really?

18:22.769 --> 18:25.939
I’m tellin’ you,
this town ain’t for shit.

18:25.939 --> 18:29.151
My mom’s boyfriend’s house
got broken into last month.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.987
He came home and two Oxy fiends
were carrying his microwave

18:31.987 --> 18:34.156
out the back door.
It’s probably the same assholes.

18:34.156 --> 18:37.910
‐ Aw. Yeah, maybe.
‐ What’d they take?

18:37.910 --> 18:39.620
I...I don’t know,

18:39.620 --> 18:41.955
I‐I don’t think
anything’s missing.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.960
Huh.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.755
Squatters?
But you didn’t see anybody.

18:49.755 --> 18:51.089
Nope.

18:54.635 --> 18:57.930
Yeah, there’s property damage...

18:57.930 --> 18:59.765
<i>Please hold, ma’am.</i>

18:59.765 --> 19:02.142
You know,
if you hired me full‐time,

19:02.142 --> 19:04.394
I could clean up
this whole place for you.

19:23.247 --> 19:25.916
‐ Cool murder basement.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

19:30.838 --> 19:35.050
Is that...what I think it is?

19:38.804 --> 19:40.514
Oh, shit!

19:40.514 --> 19:42.015
You lived down the street
from him,

19:42.015 --> 19:44.768
so you had like
a front row seat.

19:44.768 --> 19:47.396
Did he do it?
Did he whack his father?

19:47.396 --> 19:49.731
I have such
a crazy day tomorrow.

19:49.731 --> 19:52.609
Um, you know,
I didn’t sleep last night,

19:52.609 --> 19:56.071
and I think right now
I need to focus

19:56.071 --> 19:58.031
on my <i>Local Color</i> presentation.

20:05.706 --> 20:08.125
Thanks for asking, Corey.

20:08.125 --> 20:11.753
Phase one in any
community revitalization...

20:11.753 --> 20:14.506
‐ Phase one...
‐ You gotta know the community.

20:14.506 --> 20:15.632
You’ve gotta know
the community.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.176
Thanks for asking, Corey.

20:17.176 --> 20:19.636
‐ I was born in Maine...
‐ I was born in Maine...

20:19.636 --> 20:21.847
Thanks for asking, Corey.
I was born in Maine...

20:21.847 --> 20:25.684
I am a proud,
fifth‐generation Maineiac.

20:25.684 --> 20:28.687
When I say Castle Rock
has excellent boats‐‐

20:28.687 --> 20:30.522
Don’t say "boats."

20:32.399 --> 20:36.528
OK. Pull it together.
Pull it together.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.174
Shit.

21:01.595 --> 21:03.138
Damnit!

21:13.023 --> 21:15.651
Well, well,
if it isn’t Old Miss Layaway.

21:15.651 --> 21:17.653
You followin’ me now?

21:17.653 --> 21:20.447
I asked around at the school,
and they said to try here.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.241
Said I was your
college counselor.

21:22.241 --> 21:23.200
And how are my chances?

21:25.160 --> 21:27.621
‐ I’ve got money.
‐ Well, looks like we’ve got

21:27.621 --> 21:29.373
a real free market tragedy here.

21:29.373 --> 21:30.707
Demand, but no supply.

21:30.707 --> 21:33.710
‐ What?
‐ My, uh, Gran...

21:33.710 --> 21:36.380
brings the pills down
from Skowhegan,

21:36.380 --> 21:38.715
and her gout took a bad turn,
they have her on bed rest.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.343
So check back next week
or whatever.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.679
I’m having
a really bad fucking day.

21:43.679 --> 21:46.640
This guy I used to know
came back to town,

21:46.640 --> 21:48.934
and it’s really fucking me up.
And...

21:48.934 --> 21:50.936
I’m gonna be on TV
in the morning.

21:50.936 --> 21:52.688
I need my pills.

21:52.688 --> 21:54.898
How many Minions you kill
to make that jacket?

21:54.898 --> 21:55.858
Six.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.820
Listen, if you really
need a fix that bad,

21:59.820 --> 22:01.989
you could always try your luck
at the motor court.

22:01.989 --> 22:04.408
‐ Huh?
‐ Timberland Motor Court.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.034
Ask for Derek.

22:34.271 --> 22:36.899
<i>I can’t explain it.</i>

22:36.899 --> 22:41.111
<i>I can hear what</i>
<i>you’re thinking and feeling.</i>

22:41.111 --> 22:45.115
<i>You know,</i>
<i>he’s not my real father.</i>

22:45.115 --> 22:48.202
<i>Obviously.</i>

22:48.202 --> 22:50.829
<i>The trumpet will sound</i>
<i>and the dead will be raised,</i>

22:50.829 --> 22:52.706
<i>imperishable.</i>

23:22.486 --> 23:23.695
<i>Do you hear it?</i>

23:33.247 --> 23:34.540
Do you hear it now?

23:37.042 --> 23:38.126
<i>Henry!</i>

24:16.540 --> 24:18.834
Hello?

24:26.466 --> 24:27.426
Hi.

24:28.594 --> 24:31.388
‐ Are you OK?
‐ Yes.

24:32.931 --> 24:35.267
Where’s Derek?

24:40.105 --> 24:41.356
OK.

24:44.151 --> 24:47.070
<i>Bring her up here, Bailiff.</i>
<i>Immediately.</i>

24:47.070 --> 24:50.532
<i>We don’t have to help?</i>

24:50.532 --> 24:52.951
<i>You have to follow</i>
<i>the court’s rules.</i>

24:52.951 --> 24:55.204
<i>That means I am to escort you.</i>

24:55.204 --> 24:58.248
<i>Sit still, witness.</i>

24:58.248 --> 25:00.417
<i>You have to be sworn in first.</i>

25:00.417 --> 25:02.085
<i>Do you swear</i>
<i>to tell the truth,</i>

25:02.085 --> 25:03.629
<i>the whole truth,</i>
<i>and nothing but the truth?</i>

25:03.629 --> 25:05.506
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Tell the court‐‐</i>

25:05.506 --> 25:07.174
<i>what did you see?</i>

25:07.174 --> 25:09.301
<i>Her sneaker was</i>
<i>full of blood.</i>

25:09.301 --> 25:10.886
<i>What was the cause of death?</i>

25:10.886 --> 25:12.513
<i>Holes punched</i>
<i>in her stomach.</i>

25:12.513 --> 25:13.722
<i>Her head was bashed</i>

25:13.722 --> 25:15.265
against a rock quarry stone.

25:15.265 --> 25:18.352
And in your professional
opinion, Coroner,

25:18.352 --> 25:20.562
how would you categorize
this murder?

25:20.562 --> 25:22.898
Was it a crime of passion?

25:22.898 --> 25:25.067
The wounds on the body
were deep and red,

25:25.067 --> 25:28.237
so we believe the murderer
was someone she knew.

25:28.237 --> 25:30.364
Could it have been someone
in her family?

25:30.364 --> 25:31.698
Maybe.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.992
We can test the blood for that.

25:33.992 --> 25:36.662
Or maybe it was her best friend.

25:49.341 --> 25:52.135
I’m‐‐
I’m looking for someone.

25:52.135 --> 25:54.805
Go on with your testimony.

25:54.805 --> 25:57.307
I don’t care about your‐‐
your game, OK?

25:57.307 --> 26:00.269
‐ Sit down.
‐ Just tell Derek I’m here.

26:00.269 --> 26:02.229
If you want
what you came for,

26:02.229 --> 26:04.398
then sit down!

26:08.944 --> 26:12.072
I won’t tolerate
any further interruptions.

26:12.072 --> 26:16.118
I will have order
in this court.

26:16.118 --> 26:18.954
- ‐ The court appreciates...
- Where are your parents?

26:18.954 --> 26:20.747
They’re out drunk.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.457
Our moms are out drunk,

26:22.457 --> 26:24.293
but our daddies
are at Shawshank.

26:24.293 --> 26:25.961
- ‐ All of them?
- You understand

26:25.961 --> 26:27.421
that you are on trial
for murder?

26:27.421 --> 26:28.839
Yes, Your Honor.

26:28.839 --> 26:29.965
You understand that
these charges

26:29.965 --> 26:31.383
carry the penalty of death?

26:31.383 --> 26:32.968
‐ Wasn’t me.
‐ Say "Not guilty"

26:32.968 --> 26:34.261
if it wasn’t you.

26:34.261 --> 26:36.221
I’m...not guilty,
Your Honor.

26:36.221 --> 26:39.558
But the person who murdered
is in this courtroom.

26:41.310 --> 26:43.145
Point to him.
‐ What is this?

26:54.448 --> 26:56.575
OK, I don’t know
what this is,

26:56.575 --> 26:58.452
but somebody take me
to Derek right now.

26:58.452 --> 27:00.829
Appeal denied!
What does the jury say?

27:00.829 --> 27:02.915
Guilty! Guilty!

27:02.915 --> 27:06.084
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

27:06.084 --> 27:09.087
‐ Guilty! Guilty!
‐ Order!

27:09.087 --> 27:12.216
- ‐ Guilty!
- ‐ Order!

27:18.180 --> 27:20.599
You are remanded
to the death house.

27:20.599 --> 27:23.560
‐ Let go of me.
‐ I’m Derek.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.145
The kids don’t know
about the Oxy,

27:25.145 --> 27:27.022
just pretend you’re still
playing the game.

27:36.448 --> 27:38.742
Sixty for three pills.

27:38.742 --> 27:40.786
And I want to see your tits.

27:40.786 --> 27:44.498
Fuck you. I’ll give you
100 for ten.

27:44.498 --> 27:46.250
OK?

27:46.250 --> 27:48.961
‐ 
‐ Fuck!

27:51.171 --> 27:53.757
‐
‐ DEREK: Fucking cops.

28:08.689 --> 28:12.067
Duffle bag containing
one collapsible walkin’ stick,

28:12.067 --> 28:14.945
one Bible, two rubber
kitchen gloves...

28:14.945 --> 28:17.614
‐ couple of Moon Pie wrappers.
‐ Moon Pies?

28:17.614 --> 28:19.867
Little going‐away present
for himself.

28:19.867 --> 28:21.869
That’s everything that was
in the warden’s car?

28:21.869 --> 28:23.954
‐ No note?
‐ And about 30 gallons of water.

28:23.954 --> 28:26.290
Couple of trout.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.961
‐ Where’d you send the DNA?
‐ DNA?

28:30.961 --> 28:33.881
‐ You didn’t take samples?
‐ For a suicide?

28:33.881 --> 28:35.716
Listen, you gotta test
the rubber gloves.

28:35.716 --> 28:37.342
Everything that was
in the vehicle.

28:37.342 --> 28:39.219
Little cop wisdom for ya:

28:39.219 --> 28:41.638
Suicides solve themselves.

28:41.638 --> 28:44.141
I appreciate that, I do,

28:44.141 --> 28:46.518
but I’m actually looking
for my client’s DNA?

28:46.518 --> 28:49.479
The one Lacy kept
in a bear cage?

28:49.479 --> 28:50.856
If you say so.

28:55.694 --> 28:57.654
Well, fine.

28:57.654 --> 29:00.115
Court order it is.

29:00.115 --> 29:02.242
Practically everybody
in this county’s got family

29:02.242 --> 29:03.827
workin’ at that prison.

29:03.827 --> 29:06.038
I’m sure Janice
at the courthouse

29:06.038 --> 29:07.998
will make it her top priority.

29:07.998 --> 29:09.708
Hey, Carl.

29:09.708 --> 29:12.419
The real estate queen
is demanding her own cell.

29:12.419 --> 29:14.046
They’re havin’
a cat fight down there.

29:14.046 --> 29:15.255
Fuck her.

29:51.959 --> 29:54.586
<i>Sounds like</i>
<i>you had quite a night.</i>

29:54.586 --> 29:57.089
<i>Wanna tell me what happened?</i>

29:57.089 --> 29:58.674
<i>Not really.</i>

29:58.674 --> 30:00.717
Booking officer said
you’ll pay a fine.

30:00.717 --> 30:03.512
I’m not sure what
impound charges are in 2018.

30:04.763 --> 30:06.306
Then there’s <i>my</i> fee.

30:06.306 --> 30:08.809
I’m only 700,
but you can probably

30:08.809 --> 30:10.686
talk me down to
a Grand Slam breakfast.

30:10.686 --> 30:11.895
OK.

30:14.064 --> 30:15.858
We can’t do this.

30:15.858 --> 30:17.860
‐ What?
‐ I am more than happy

30:17.860 --> 30:19.736
to compensate you
for your time.

30:19.736 --> 30:21.488
Thank you. I‐‐

30:21.488 --> 30:23.365
Maybe you have
some kind of payment plan‐‐

30:23.365 --> 30:25.033
I’m sorry,
did I miss something?

30:28.412 --> 30:30.789
I have a medical condition.

30:30.789 --> 30:32.249
OK.

30:34.001 --> 30:36.503
I feel things.

30:36.503 --> 30:38.380
‐ People do that.
‐ No.

30:38.380 --> 30:43.051
I feel things that
other people are feeling.

30:43.051 --> 30:47.055
And some people
are louder than others.

30:50.225 --> 30:53.520
OK, you know...

30:53.520 --> 30:56.064
when you get a song
stuck in your head,

30:56.064 --> 30:59.151
and you can’t think about
anything else‐‐

30:59.151 --> 31:01.153
what you were doing
five minutes ago,

31:01.153 --> 31:02.738
what you wanted for dinner‐‐

31:02.738 --> 31:05.824
all you can think about
is the fucking Bee Gees,

31:05.824 --> 31:07.659
or whatever.

31:07.659 --> 31:10.078
When we were kids,

31:10.078 --> 31:12.039
you were that song for me.

31:14.791 --> 31:17.836
And I’m not saying
you’re a bad song.

31:17.836 --> 31:20.255
You’re obviously
a very handsome song,

31:20.255 --> 31:22.216
and charming and smart

31:22.216 --> 31:24.551
and you dress better than the
rest of the songs in this town,

31:24.551 --> 31:26.094
‐ but‐‐
‐ Yesterday you barely

31:26.094 --> 31:27.846
‐ remembered my name.
‐ That was a lie.

31:27.846 --> 31:29.014
I was lying.

31:30.807 --> 31:34.394
Things happen...
when we’re together,

31:34.394 --> 31:37.147
‐ When we’re‐‐
‐ and it can be overwhelming.

31:37.147 --> 31:40.108
And sometimes
I can lose track of myself,

31:40.108 --> 31:43.320
and I cannot afford
to do that again.

31:48.825 --> 31:51.620
I had a very
important day today.

31:51.620 --> 31:54.331
I signed a five‐year lease
on the mill downtown.

31:54.331 --> 31:57.084
I had a whole plan, whole plan,
and I was supposed to go

31:57.084 --> 31:59.086
on <i>Local Color</i> this morning
to talk about it.

31:59.086 --> 32:00.921
‐ The TV show?
‐ Yes.

32:00.921 --> 32:02.923
You know, and then I spend
five minutes with you,

32:02.923 --> 32:04.758
and the next thing you know,

32:04.758 --> 32:06.760
I’m a jail cell
with some prostitute

32:06.760 --> 32:09.012
who can unhinge her jaw
like a python‐‐

32:09.012 --> 32:12.391
What time were you
supposed to be on TV?

32:12.391 --> 32:15.519
Like ten, but I was supposed
to be there at nine for the‐‐

32:15.519 --> 32:17.521
‐
‐ for the‐‐

32:17.521 --> 32:19.857
Hey. Right here.
We gotta get a cab.

32:26.363 --> 32:28.615
‐ <i>Local Color?</i>
‐ Yeah, over there.

32:32.786 --> 32:34.121
<i>Yeah, I can hold.</i>

32:36.498 --> 32:38.876
<i>Hey, David, thanks for</i>
<i>returning my call.</i>

32:38.876 --> 32:41.003
<i>You are not gonna believe</i>
<i>what’s going on up here.</i>

32:41.003 --> 32:44.047
<i>We’re two degrees</i>
<i>from the state of nature.</i>

32:44.047 --> 32:46.758
<i>Kept him in a cage!</i>

32:46.758 --> 32:49.303
<i>Yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>like a circus type.</i>

32:49.303 --> 32:52.055
<i>No charge, no trial,</i>
<i>no arrest.</i>

32:52.055 --> 32:54.975
<i>And habeas isn't proof. He said "This,
don't pretend if it doesn't exist."</i>

32:56.560 --> 32:58.562
<i>No, no, I wouldn’t</i>
<i>put it past them.</i>

32:58.562 --> 33:00.105
<i>That’s why I’m calling you.</i>

33:00.105 --> 33:02.900
<i>It’s L‐A‐C‐Y.</i>

33:08.906 --> 33:10.532
- Five minutes to air!
- ‐

33:10.532 --> 33:12.576
<i>...history</i>
<i>of irregular activities...</i>

33:12.576 --> 33:15.037
<i>An old adage goes,</i>
<i>"If you want something done,</i>

33:15.037 --> 33:16.413
<i>ask a busy person."</i>

33:16.413 --> 33:18.582
<i>No one these days is busier</i>

33:18.582 --> 33:20.584
<i>than real estate agent</i>
<i>Molly Strand.</i>

33:20.584 --> 33:22.794
<i>I believe</i>
<i>she’s the go‐getting gal</i>

33:22.794 --> 33:26.006
<i>Castle County needs</i>
<i>in its revitalization...</i>

33:26.006 --> 33:29.134
<i>We’re two degrees</i>
<i>from the state of nature.</i>

33:29.134 --> 33:30.928
<i>Kept him in a cage!</i>

33:41.271 --> 33:44.816
<i>She understands the</i>
<i>importance of collaboration...</i>

33:44.816 --> 33:48.570
...new vision, embraces tech,
job opportunities,

33:48.570 --> 33:51.657
and, oh, those
ethnic fusion restaurants.

33:51.657 --> 33:54.117
Mm‐mm! Molly, why don’t you
go ahead and tell us

33:54.117 --> 33:55.827
what we’re looking at?

34:00.499 --> 34:02.042
Sorry, I, um...

34:10.092 --> 34:12.678
<i>Well, the town’s future’s</i>
<i>so bright</i>

34:12.678 --> 34:14.054
<i>she has to wear shades.</i>

34:14.054 --> 34:15.764
Can I get a cup of coffee,
please?

34:15.764 --> 34:16.889
<i>You’ve made</i>
<i>a beautiful diorama</i>

34:16.889 --> 34:18.600
depicting the hamlet

34:18.600 --> 34:21.311
known as Castle Rock,

34:21.311 --> 34:24.188
although it’s grown
a pedestrian mall.

34:27.067 --> 34:29.902
- ‐ Uh‐oh.
<i>- Obviously,</i>

34:29.902 --> 34:31.989
<i>the economy’s</i>
<i>not what it used to be,</i>

34:31.989 --> 34:35.701
but our downtown core
still has great bones.

34:35.701 --> 34:38.745
Some folks might question
whether Castle Rock

34:38.745 --> 34:41.164
requires such
a radical transformation.

34:41.164 --> 34:43.375
Now, what would you say
to neighbors who,

34:43.375 --> 34:44.960
well, like things
the way they are?

34:53.467 --> 34:55.762
Molly?

34:55.762 --> 34:58.265
I’d tell them
to wake the fuck up.

34:58.265 --> 35:00.267
‐ Ho!
‐ There’s a young man

35:00.267 --> 35:03.645
right now in a cell
at Shawshank State Prison

35:03.645 --> 35:06.857
whose constitutional
due process was never respected,

35:06.857 --> 35:09.818
<i>who was locked</i>
<i>in a tiger cage,</i>

35:09.818 --> 35:11.486
<i>no trial, no arrest,</i>

35:11.486 --> 35:13.030
and this is just the latest

35:13.030 --> 35:14.907
<i>in a pattern of abuses</i>

35:14.907 --> 35:16.283
<i>by our local authorities</i>

35:16.283 --> 35:18.160
that stretches back decades.

35:18.160 --> 35:21.872
So, yes, I think Castle Rock
is ready for a little change.

35:23.665 --> 35:26.376
- ‐ Uh...
- Cut to commercial.

35:26.376 --> 35:28.212
And we’re clear.

35:42.684 --> 35:44.144
<i>Truth is,</i>
<i>this guy could actually</i>

35:44.144 --> 35:45.854
<i>have a record, so</i>

35:45.854 --> 35:48.357
ordinarily I wouldn’t
have gone to the press.

35:49.608 --> 35:52.528
Risky, but...

35:52.528 --> 35:53.904
I guess we’ll off‐road.

36:00.869 --> 36:04.540
Listen, I don’t know how you
know all that about my client,

36:04.540 --> 36:07.251
but I appreciate
you trying to help.

36:09.878 --> 36:11.338
I know.

36:30.399 --> 36:32.985
<i>Well, it was good to see you.</i>

36:51.628 --> 36:53.422
You too.

37:17.696 --> 37:20.240
‐
‐

37:54.816 --> 37:56.235
Mr. Deaver.

37:59.404 --> 38:01.615
Do you remember
that old toothpaste commercial

38:01.615 --> 38:04.826
"You never get a second chance
to make a first impression"?

38:04.826 --> 38:07.287
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

38:09.164 --> 38:11.959
I’ll be honest, I was surprised
to get your call.

38:11.959 --> 38:14.586
Didn’t think anyone watched
cable access anymore.

38:14.586 --> 38:17.422
The press might not be
so good for your client.

38:17.422 --> 38:19.758
I’m sure you know.

38:19.758 --> 38:22.302
Finally acknowledging
my client exists, then.

38:31.019 --> 38:35.274
It’s the maximum settlement
under state law. 300,000.

38:35.274 --> 38:38.110
For wrongful conviction,
which this isn’t.

38:38.110 --> 38:40.028
This is kidnapping.

38:40.028 --> 38:42.322
Also, "Plaintiff
shall hold harmless

38:42.322 --> 38:45.909
prime contractor, all directors,
officers and employees."

38:45.909 --> 38:48.537
This isn’t a settlement.
It’s an indemnification.

38:48.537 --> 38:50.622
The actions
of one rogue ex‐employee

38:50.622 --> 38:52.291
don’t reflect the values
of Northeast Correctional

38:52.291 --> 38:53.792
or its shareholders.

38:53.792 --> 38:55.460
Throwing the old warden
under the bus.

38:55.460 --> 38:57.754
Where you
throw dead perverts.

38:59.256 --> 39:01.341
This is a turnkey solution.

39:01.341 --> 39:03.677
He signs the NDA,
he walks away with more

39:03.677 --> 39:05.804
than he’ll make
in his lifetime.

39:05.804 --> 39:07.806
We both know that
the longer he stays in here,

39:07.806 --> 39:10.601
the longer we have to prove
that he’s not just some victim.

39:10.601 --> 39:12.394
In my experience,

39:12.394 --> 39:14.688
there aren’t a lot of victims
on the inside,

39:14.688 --> 39:16.190
no matter how they got here.

39:19.902 --> 39:23.155
‐ Hmm. Dandruff.
‐ What?

39:23.155 --> 39:26.283
The commercial.
It was dandruff shampoo.

39:27.993 --> 39:29.620
Let’s see what he says.

40:09.576 --> 40:11.119
You’re Deaver?

40:22.005 --> 40:23.465
<i>Are you OK?</i>

40:26.218 --> 40:27.970
Physically?

40:30.681 --> 40:32.599
Has anyone threatened you?

40:38.689 --> 40:41.108
Hey. I want you to listen.

40:42.776 --> 40:44.319
I’m your lawyer now,

40:44.319 --> 40:46.029
and your lawyer is telling you

40:46.029 --> 40:48.198
that we have
a brand‐new strategy.

40:48.198 --> 40:51.243
From this moment, you want
to keep saying my name, great,

40:51.243 --> 40:53.245
just don’t tell anyone yours.

40:53.245 --> 40:55.497
If you’ve got no name,
you’ve got no charge,

40:55.497 --> 40:57.416
no crime, no story.

40:57.416 --> 40:59.126
As crazy as that may seem,

40:59.126 --> 41:00.711
that’s the best thing
you have going for you.

41:00.711 --> 41:03.005
So I won’t ask,
and you don’t tell.

41:07.342 --> 41:08.802
You understand?

41:15.017 --> 41:16.935
Has it begun?

41:21.106 --> 41:24.318
Our new game plan starts now.
OK?

41:26.695 --> 41:27.821
OK?

41:31.158 --> 41:32.117
OK.

41:33.285 --> 41:34.411
Good.

41:36.330 --> 41:38.040
There’s an offer
on the table.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.167
The prison wants
to cap punitive damages

41:40.167 --> 41:42.961
in exchange for
letting you walk.

41:42.961 --> 41:45.172
I say we employ
the tried‐and‐true

41:45.172 --> 41:48.050
legal strategy
of "Go fuck yourself."

41:48.050 --> 41:50.469
Sounds better in Latin.

41:50.469 --> 41:52.346
In about a week,
a circuit court judge

41:52.346 --> 41:54.473
is gonna hear
our <i>habeas</i> request.

41:54.473 --> 41:57.601
There’ll be about half an hour
of witness testimony,

41:57.601 --> 41:59.811
and then you’re gonna walk out
of that courthouse a free man.

41:59.811 --> 42:02.523
They day after,
we file for civil damages,

42:02.523 --> 42:04.274
and when that’s over,

42:04.274 --> 42:06.652
you’re gonna own
the whole damn county.

42:06.652 --> 42:10.155
Turn this place
into your boat garage.

42:10.155 --> 42:12.115
Boats?

42:12.115 --> 42:14.493
That’s right.

42:16.245 --> 42:18.247
How many years old are you?

42:23.585 --> 42:24.878
Thirty‐nine.

42:27.673 --> 42:29.383
Do you hear it now?

42:37.558 --> 42:39.434
Time’s up.
Let’s go.

42:42.479 --> 42:43.605
Come on.

43:44.333 --> 43:45.584
Hello?

44:07.981 --> 44:10.108
Oh, God, what a disaster.

44:58.073 --> 44:59.283
Hello?

46:51.562 --> 46:54.731
No! No!

46:54.731 --> 46:57.860
Stay away!
Stay away! Fuck!

46:57.860 --> 47:01.238
Behold, I will tell you
a mystery.

47:01.238 --> 47:04.491
No!

48:58.438 --> 48:59.565
Bad robot!
