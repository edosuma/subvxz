WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:03.202
I'm infected.

00:03.203 --> 00:04.737
I'm not your responsibility, okay?

00:04.738 --> 00:06.139
You're my friend, Alex.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.074
Two Witnesses, we look
out for one another.

00:08.074 --> 00:09.943
Anything we face, we face as one.

00:09.943 --> 00:12.312
Turns out our agency has a pedigree.

00:12.313 --> 00:15.148
We are the occupational
descendants of real heroes.

00:15.149 --> 00:18.785
From here on out, I'm just
gonna be honest, promise.

00:18.786 --> 00:19.849
Something's coming.

00:19.850 --> 00:21.688
Not something, Miss Jenny.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.790
- Another vision?
- It was spectacular.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.459
I'm destined to become

00:26.460 --> 00:29.862
the best thing that has
ever happened to America.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.531
Is this really what
you wanted, Dreyfuss?

00:32.533 --> 00:34.634
The death of democracy?

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:58.692 --> 01:01.127
Move it, you're holding everyone up.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.134
And...

01:08.869 --> 01:10.403
...posted.

01:11.538 --> 01:13.206
- You're not helping.
- Helping?

01:13.207 --> 01:14.790
I don't even know what we're doing here

01:14.791 --> 01:16.542
on this kid's obstacle course.

01:16.543 --> 01:18.311
- Training.
- Training?

01:18.312 --> 01:20.213
Oh.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.997
Is there a competition
for getting humiliated

01:21.998 --> 01:23.416
by 12-year-old girls?

01:23.417 --> 01:24.917
'Cause if so, you're kicking butt.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.753
You can make fun all you want.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.555
But I'm gonna make sure
that I'm in primo shape

01:29.556 --> 01:32.258
so whenever I'm needed, I'll be ready.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.760
Ow, ow, ow.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.561
This is about the Vault, isn't it?

01:35.562 --> 01:38.064
You find out that we
work for the same agency,

01:38.065 --> 01:40.066
as Davy Crockett and Sacagawea once did,

01:40.067 --> 01:42.090
and now you're convinced
you need to be James Bond.

01:42.091 --> 01:43.936
Alex, they were heroes,
all right? Legends.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.605
We are not worthy.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.206
Dude, get a grip.

01:47.207 --> 01:49.208
What are you trying to prove?

01:49.209 --> 01:51.577
You just took down a demonic djinn,

01:51.578 --> 01:54.213
and saved a bunch of
lives in the process.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.816
Including mine.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.918
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.953
Are you saying I'm your hero?

02:02.556 --> 02:04.257
- Hmm?
- You know what?

02:04.258 --> 02:06.401
Next time just let me get
absorbed by the djinn, okay?

02:07.361 --> 02:09.562
I'm a mess.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.097
All right, now.

02:11.098 --> 02:14.167
Will you time me, please?

02:14.168 --> 02:15.868
Okay?

02:15.869 --> 02:17.236
Okay.

02:17.237 --> 02:20.373
I'm good, I'm good.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.710
Don't forget, your interpretations

02:23.711 --> 02:27.046
of Munch's The Scream are due tomorrow.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.182
Or else you might see me screaming.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.051
Hey, Molly.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.675
I noticed your past
couple of assignments

02:33.676 --> 02:35.388
seemed incomplete.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.732
Do you need an extension on them?

02:36.733 --> 02:38.224
I guess.

02:38.225 --> 02:40.226
Our next unit's gonna be a lot of fun.

02:40.227 --> 02:41.850
I know how you like
mixed-media projects.

02:41.851 --> 02:44.163
We're gonna be... Molly.

02:44.164 --> 02:48.034
Molly, Mr. David is speaking to you.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.003
That's okay.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.610
I am so sorry about that.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.412
No worries. I'm used to dealing

02:59.413 --> 03:01.013
with some pretty short attention spans.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.048
Yeah.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.417
But if you don't mind me asking,

03:04.418 --> 03:06.419
is everything okay with Molly at home?

03:06.420 --> 03:08.921
I might be flattering
myself but I thought

03:08.922 --> 03:10.882
- this was her favorite class.
- No, you're right.

03:10.906 --> 03:12.458
- She loves art.
- I'm glad.

03:12.459 --> 03:13.962
That's why I couldn't help but notice

03:13.963 --> 03:15.928
that she just hasn't
been herself lately.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.898
Yeah. Things... have been

03:18.899 --> 03:21.067
a little more complicated
for her lately.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.169
I'd love to discuss this further,

03:23.170 --> 03:25.238
but I've got a faculty meeting.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.472
Can you come by later?

03:26.473 --> 03:28.574
Sure.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.676
Great.

03:40.687 --> 03:43.389
Kind of rough back there with Mr. David.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.493
Guess you're right.

03:47.494 --> 03:48.895
School's overrated.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.329
There are a lot of career options

03:50.330 --> 03:52.732
that don't require an education.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.568
I'm thinking pirates.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.739
Look, I know with everything going on

03:59.740 --> 04:03.109
it seems like school
isn't important, but it is.

04:03.110 --> 04:06.078
It's... really good for us

04:06.079 --> 04:08.648
to keep some normal in our lives.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.017
It's always gonna be like
this from now on, isn't it?

04:11.018 --> 04:15.388
Monsters disguised as Dad.

04:15.389 --> 04:19.158
Logan MacDonald getting
sick from a curse.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.194
Visions of Mr. Crane,

04:21.195 --> 04:23.863
except he's not Mr. Crane.

04:23.864 --> 04:24.564
Molly!

04:24.565 --> 04:27.066
Hello?

04:27.067 --> 04:30.303
He was so scared, Mom, so alone.

04:30.304 --> 04:33.039
We still don't know exactly
what it is that you saw.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.908
It could have been a-a bad dream.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.644
Got an idea.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.146
I've been talking to the others

04:40.147 --> 04:41.290
about showing you something,

04:41.291 --> 04:45.227
but... maybe now's the time.

04:46.186 --> 04:47.753
Showing me something?

04:47.754 --> 04:49.355
What?

04:49.356 --> 04:52.358
Welcome to the Vault.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.594
What is this place?

04:54.595 --> 04:56.729
Uh, the most amazing library ever.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.031
An archive of the incredible.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.634
A repository of the impossible.

05:01.635 --> 05:05.872
A storehouse of secrets great and small.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.206
Whoa.

05:07.207 --> 05:10.810
This... is the untold history

05:10.811 --> 05:12.378
of America, huh?

05:12.379 --> 05:16.782
This is a collection of
weapons from myth and lore.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.117
Huh?

05:18.118 --> 05:19.719
And this...

05:19.720 --> 05:22.788
is classified supernatural information

05:22.789 --> 05:25.358
that's only revealed to
sitting U.S. presidents.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.460
And now... you.

05:28.295 --> 05:29.962
- Hey, kid... Catch.
- Ooh.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.698
What is this?

05:32.699 --> 05:34.282
That is a Native American Thunderstone,

05:34.283 --> 05:36.569
created by the Pawnee Morning Star god.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.313
It's supposed to protect
you from lightning.

05:38.314 --> 05:40.482
I haven't tested it out
yet, if you want to help.

05:43.944 --> 05:47.280
I know you've been through
some dark and scary stuff.

05:47.281 --> 05:50.182
But you also get to
be a part of something

05:50.183 --> 05:53.119
that only a few people in
the whole world know about.

05:53.120 --> 05:57.023
You get to be a part of a secret club.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.425
What do you think?

05:59.426 --> 06:01.594
I think this is really cool.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.596
Good.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.631
Mr. Crane's gonna be
here in a few minutes.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.099
You're not staying?

06:07.100 --> 06:10.202
I have to do some stuff for work, but...

06:10.203 --> 06:12.138
Jake and Alex will show
you anything you want.

06:12.139 --> 06:16.309
Anything that's... not
too dangerous, right?

06:16.310 --> 06:18.177
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:19.780 --> 06:20.813
Now...

06:20.814 --> 06:23.049
where should we start?

06:38.498 --> 06:40.433
Are you sure about this?

06:40.434 --> 06:43.669
Indian ascetics have used
this method for centuries...

06:43.670 --> 06:46.772
...in pursuit of their visions.

06:46.773 --> 06:50.309
But you seem to have no
trouble accessing your visions.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.978
To a point, Jobe.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.779
I've seen the future to a point.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.014
Now I need

06:55.015 --> 06:56.482
to push past what I've glimpsed.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.984
I need to extend the limits.

07:17.471 --> 07:20.806
I hope you find what you seek, Malcolm.

07:34.154 --> 07:37.523
Hey. Don't move. I'm not finished yet.

07:37.524 --> 07:40.326
I always have so much
trouble with your eyes.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.328
Really?

07:42.329 --> 07:44.063
Would that be because they're so

07:44.064 --> 07:46.499
fantastically full of wisdom?

07:46.500 --> 07:48.501
Well, if I mess this up,

07:48.502 --> 07:50.503
then you'll only have yourself to blame

07:50.504 --> 07:52.004
when your present isn't perfect.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.073
My present?

07:54.074 --> 07:55.441
Of course.

07:55.442 --> 07:56.675
It's a little thank you gift

07:56.676 --> 07:59.111
for everything.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.780
Can we fly the glider tomorrow?

08:01.882 --> 08:04.050
A girl after my own heart.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.318
I can't deny you anything, now, can I?

08:22.702 --> 08:26.605
So... was the future
different this time?

08:26.606 --> 08:30.176
It's still the future I'm
destined to bring about.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.681
But it's far superior this time.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.183
How so?

08:39.052 --> 08:42.188
I'm not alone.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.592
Master Wells and Miss Alex

08:46.593 --> 08:48.394
will return shortly with our repast.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.262
Cool. Pizza?

08:50.263 --> 08:52.398
Something a little more delectable

08:52.399 --> 08:54.633
than Neapolitan flatbread.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.569
Well, look at that.

08:58.405 --> 09:01.941
You know this was actually
worn by Davy Crockett.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.442
True.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.578
Now, legend would have you believe

09:05.579 --> 09:08.781
that this was fashioned
from common raccoon.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.916
But between you and me,

09:10.917 --> 09:13.252
this is actually Wendigo pelt.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.987
Wendi what?

09:14.988 --> 09:16.922
Wendigo.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.224
It's a shape-shifting beast

09:18.225 --> 09:20.726
of Shawnee and Algonquian legend.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.498
Monsters.

09:25.499 --> 09:26.799
Monsters.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.534
Where do they come from?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.004
Purgatory.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.507
Hell dimensions.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.642
Hidden pockets of existence

09:36.643 --> 09:39.078
of which we are only dimly aware.

09:39.079 --> 09:43.015
And they just roam
around like wild animals?

09:43.016 --> 09:45.951
Some do.

09:45.952 --> 09:48.687
Mostly they appear when summoned.

09:48.688 --> 09:51.524
When a person wishes to perpetrate evil.

09:51.525 --> 09:54.827
So bad people means bad monsters.

09:54.828 --> 09:59.031
Now that is very aptly put.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.233
I know a good monster.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.735
A good monster?

10:02.736 --> 10:04.069
Finally.

10:04.070 --> 10:05.738
Yeah.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.339
I made him up when I was little.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.243
He's one of the first
things I remember drawing.

10:09.244 --> 10:12.478
His body was my favorite blanket.

10:12.479 --> 10:15.881
Whenever I was scared or lonely,

10:15.882 --> 10:18.050
he'd be there for me.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.019
I call him Mr. Stitch.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.353
Oh.

10:23.690 --> 10:27.693
It is a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Stitch.

10:27.694 --> 10:30.162
He used to sing me this song.

11:20.652 --> 11:27.552
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

11:27.704 --> 11:30.203
Even as a born and bred Washingtonian

11:30.204 --> 11:31.556
I suspect you are unaware

11:31.557 --> 11:33.458
of the secret passageways
beneath the city.

11:36.128 --> 11:37.195
Whoa.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.663
Whoa, indeed.

11:38.664 --> 11:41.207
During the War of 1812, these were used

11:41.208 --> 11:43.234
to transport munitions,

11:43.235 --> 11:46.704
and spies traversed them to
vital points around the city.

11:46.705 --> 11:49.173
Nowadays, Master Wells stores bottles

11:49.174 --> 11:52.410
of his fuller-bodied syrah down here.

11:52.411 --> 11:54.679
Hello!

11:54.680 --> 11:56.514
Hello!

11:57.683 --> 11:59.484
Hello!

11:59.485 --> 12:01.185
Hello!

12:01.186 --> 12:02.186
Hello!

12:02.187 --> 12:03.221
Hello!

12:03.222 --> 12:04.656
Hello!

12:04.657 --> 12:08.393
Hello!

12:17.236 --> 12:19.070
Um, what's going on?

12:19.071 --> 12:21.939
I'm not certain.

12:27.179 --> 12:29.180
Hmm. Well...

12:29.181 --> 12:31.582
uh, i-it's all right,
I'm sure there's...

12:31.583 --> 12:34.085
a way to reverse it.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.187
A switch...

12:36.188 --> 12:38.523
of some... kind.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.224
Nope.

12:40.225 --> 12:41.259
Well, no, no, no,

12:41.260 --> 12:42.460
it's all right, trust me.

12:42.461 --> 12:43.795
There's, um...

12:43.796 --> 12:45.630
We'll sort this.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.734
This is sort of like the lockdown drills

12:49.735 --> 12:51.035
we have at school.

12:51.036 --> 12:54.038
Yes, precisely. We are locked down.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.240
Not locked in.

12:57.476 --> 12:59.510
Right.

12:59.511 --> 13:02.547
We shall get our sharpest
minds on the case.

13:05.184 --> 13:06.851
What are you doing?

13:06.852 --> 13:08.619
What do you think? Morse code.

13:08.620 --> 13:11.789
Crane! If you can hear me,

13:11.790 --> 13:13.257
tap twice!

13:14.760 --> 13:17.695
Uh, I believe we have

13:17.696 --> 13:20.231
stumbled upon a more effective
form of communication,

13:20.232 --> 13:21.299
Master Wells.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.767
Uh, right.

13:22.768 --> 13:24.168
You guys okay in there?

13:25.871 --> 13:28.039
Yes, we're fine. In fact, I'd say we're

13:28.040 --> 13:29.440
in the safest room in the building.

13:29.464 --> 13:30.575
All right, hang tight,

13:30.576 --> 13:32.759
we're gonna check on things,
and we'll get back to you.

13:32.760 --> 13:33.611
Well, he's right.

13:33.612 --> 13:35.554
They are in the safest
place in the building.

13:35.555 --> 13:36.604
Which is what makes me think

13:36.605 --> 13:38.301
that this is a security
system of some kind.

13:38.302 --> 13:40.263
What? Security? How come
we never knew about this?

13:40.287 --> 13:42.527
I'm learning there's a lot
about the Vault we never knew.

13:42.849 --> 13:44.383
That's the mark of Benjamin Banneker.

13:44.384 --> 13:46.619
Right, and we know that
he specialized in guards

13:46.620 --> 13:49.021
and traps, which makes me think
that he's the one that designed

13:49.022 --> 13:50.730
- the security for this place.
- To protect the Vault

13:50.731 --> 13:52.291
- against supernatural threats.
- Right,

13:52.315 --> 13:54.610
but the question is, what
kind of threat triggered it?

13:55.061 --> 13:56.996
What happened? Is Molly okay?

13:56.997 --> 13:58.157
She's fine. Crane's with her.

13:58.181 --> 14:00.122
Jenny's scouting the
exterior and the tunnels.

14:00.123 --> 14:02.523
- All's quiet on all fronts.
- Look, it's probably just

14:02.524 --> 14:04.997
a short in the security system...
I mean, it is 200 years old.

14:04.998 --> 14:06.495
A technical malfunction?

14:06.496 --> 14:08.697
On the one day I wanted Molly

14:08.698 --> 14:10.499
to see this world isn't completely

14:10.500 --> 14:11.700
dangerous and unpredictable.

14:11.701 --> 14:12.835
Okay, guys, check this out.

14:12.836 --> 14:14.670
It looks like someone decided to beef up

14:14.671 --> 14:17.106
the security with their
own mystical reinforcements.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.941
These were carved at a later time.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.709
I don't recognize these symbols.

14:20.710 --> 14:22.211
Wait, wait, wait, this number.

14:22.212 --> 14:24.713
It's a federal I.D.

14:24.714 --> 14:26.715
Federal I.D.?

14:29.119 --> 14:30.286
Okay.

14:30.287 --> 14:32.721
This I.D. belonged to...

14:32.722 --> 14:35.391
Got it. Claudia Russell.

14:35.392 --> 14:37.472
She worked in the Office
of Intelligence and Analysis

14:37.496 --> 14:39.405
from 2001 to 2003.

14:39.406 --> 14:42.575
She transferred and spent
the next seven years...

14:42.576 --> 14:44.977
in Agency 355.

14:44.978 --> 14:47.013
- The Vault.
- She was the last agent

14:47.014 --> 14:49.615
to have worked here before
us. Is she still alive?

14:50.784 --> 14:52.418
Last record of her dates back to 2011.

14:52.419 --> 14:55.154
Last known address is...

14:55.155 --> 14:57.690
- out by Gaithersburg.
- We need to talk to her.

14:57.691 --> 15:00.011
- She's the only one who can
unlock these symbols. - Yeah.

15:02.396 --> 15:04.797
I'm supposed to be meeting
with Molly's teacher.

15:04.798 --> 15:08.134
He thinks she's having
some trouble at home.

15:08.135 --> 15:10.202
- Okay, so go. We'll find Claudia Russell.
- Mm-hmm.

15:10.203 --> 15:12.538
I'm not leaving, not
with her stuck in here.

15:12.539 --> 15:14.682
No, they'll be fine, okay?
She is inside of a fortress

15:14.683 --> 15:16.475
designed by the best mystical architect

15:16.476 --> 15:18.411
in history... plus, Crane is with her.

15:18.412 --> 15:20.315
I had a teacher that
sounded the alarm on me

15:20.316 --> 15:21.957
a little bit too early,
and I had to spend

15:21.958 --> 15:23.661
the next year reporting
to a social worker.

15:23.662 --> 15:25.785
I'll be a half hour, tops.

15:25.786 --> 15:27.620
We'll get to the bottom of these runes.

15:27.621 --> 15:29.855
You hear that, Crane?!

15:29.856 --> 15:32.241
We'll be back soon!

15:32.242 --> 15:33.809
We are on...

15:33.810 --> 15:36.245
the... case!

15:37.981 --> 15:39.882
Do you want me to go
talk to Molly's teacher,

15:39.883 --> 15:41.283
and you can go with him?

15:41.284 --> 15:43.118
Pass. Just, uh,

15:43.119 --> 15:45.921
please, call me if anything comes up.

15:54.631 --> 15:57.733
Ms. Thomas, thanks for coming.

15:59.536 --> 16:01.437
Hello? Who's there?

16:01.438 --> 16:03.659
If you're looking for the
administrative office...

16:14.198 --> 16:15.698
Mr. David?

16:18.669 --> 16:20.708
Yes, I need an ambulance

16:20.709 --> 16:22.476
at Liberty Elementary School.

16:22.477 --> 16:24.412
A teacher has been attacked. He's alive,

16:24.413 --> 16:26.547
but he seems to be badly hurt.

16:26.548 --> 16:28.282
Thank you.

16:28.283 --> 16:30.551
Okay, okay,

16:30.552 --> 16:31.552
just relax.

16:31.553 --> 16:32.920
Help's on the way.

16:52.374 --> 16:53.774
He's gonna be fine.

16:53.775 --> 16:55.676
The police are working under the theory

16:55.677 --> 16:58.212
that it was a robbery gone awry.

16:58.213 --> 17:00.915
But that's not what you believe.

17:00.916 --> 17:03.050
No.

17:03.985 --> 17:05.486
Agent Thomas?

17:05.487 --> 17:07.922
When Molly was younger,

17:07.923 --> 17:10.958
she had an imaginary
friend... it had green hair

17:10.959 --> 17:13.127
and his body was made
out of her baby blanket.

17:13.127 --> 17:14.895
She used to draw it all the time.

17:14.896 --> 17:16.830
- Anyway, she called it...
- Mr. Stitch.

17:16.832 --> 17:19.400
How do you know that?

17:19.401 --> 17:20.634
Molly drew a picture

17:20.635 --> 17:22.234
of the creature in her notebook earlier.

17:22.259 --> 17:26.040
So Molly's imaginary
friend came to life?

17:26.040 --> 17:28.375
It is not unheard of.

17:28.376 --> 17:31.779
When my son was but a boy,

17:31.780 --> 17:34.815
he found solace in a treasured doll,

17:34.816 --> 17:37.351
and at a certain point,
the doll came to life.

17:37.352 --> 17:39.753
It became a champion for him.

17:41.022 --> 17:43.190
A golem.

17:43.191 --> 17:44.558
What does this thing want?

17:44.559 --> 17:46.102
Did she send it to attack her teacher?

17:46.103 --> 17:47.328
It is my understanding

17:47.329 --> 17:49.530
that these beings have
a mind of their own.

17:49.531 --> 17:53.067
But... I will speak to Molly.

17:53.068 --> 17:54.869
In the meantime, what would be helpful

17:54.870 --> 17:56.737
is if you could uncover
any information about

17:56.738 --> 17:58.773
- the creature's provenance.
- Okay.

17:58.774 --> 18:00.541
Clues to its characteristics.

18:00.542 --> 18:03.043
I kept all of her old
drawings. They're at the house.

18:03.044 --> 18:04.111
I'll look into them.

18:04.112 --> 18:06.113
Very good. And, Agent Thomas,

18:06.114 --> 18:09.817
powers of the imagination
are not to be trifled with.

18:13.655 --> 18:15.656
Not exactly a luxurious retirement.

18:15.657 --> 18:18.559
When I transferred to the
Vault from DHS Office Archives,

18:18.560 --> 18:20.561
that place had been abandoned for years.

18:20.562 --> 18:23.063
Claudia Russell could
fill in the gaps for us.

18:23.064 --> 18:25.266
Ms. Russell?

18:32.941 --> 18:34.708
Ms. Russell?

18:34.709 --> 18:36.510
We're here from the Vault.

18:36.511 --> 18:37.678
We, uh,

18:37.679 --> 18:39.780
just had a few questions.

18:50.392 --> 18:52.193
Wait! Don't-don't shoot!

18:52.194 --> 18:53.627
We're unarmed!

18:53.628 --> 18:54.895
Alex.

19:01.570 --> 19:03.771
It's boobytrapped.

19:13.882 --> 19:16.150
Oh, God.

19:21.756 --> 19:24.858
Claudia Russell, I presume.

19:36.972 --> 19:38.072
Hey, easy.

19:38.073 --> 19:39.773
Hasn't anyone ever told you

19:39.774 --> 19:41.642
not to sneak up on people,

19:41.643 --> 19:43.077
especially armed people?

19:43.078 --> 19:44.311
It's force of habit.

19:44.312 --> 19:46.246
Sneaky's kind of my default mode.

19:46.948 --> 19:48.249
Crane filled me in.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.850
Said you needed some help.

19:49.851 --> 19:51.685
I checked out all of
the protective wards

19:51.686 --> 19:52.920
I put around the entrances.

19:52.921 --> 19:54.521
Nothing's been tripped.

19:54.522 --> 19:56.323
This is the original blanket.

19:56.324 --> 19:58.158
It's completely intact.

19:58.159 --> 20:00.494
I still don't get it.

20:00.495 --> 20:02.930
How does this thing just
pop out of Molly's head?

20:02.931 --> 20:05.266
Somehow, some kind of
spell was activated.

20:05.267 --> 20:07.635
Crane's looking into it. It might help

20:07.636 --> 20:10.170
if you could tell me
more about this thing.

20:10.171 --> 20:11.705
Maybe we can figure out

20:11.706 --> 20:13.841
why it went to Molly's school.

20:13.842 --> 20:16.176
Molly must have been five, maybe six.

20:16.177 --> 20:18.178
She started showing a talent

20:18.179 --> 20:21.015
for art, so... I encouraged her.

20:21.016 --> 20:23.350
Told her to draw what made her happy.

20:23.351 --> 20:24.694
At the time, I was pretty focused

20:24.695 --> 20:26.754
on my job, so...

20:26.755 --> 20:28.822
I was away a lot.

20:28.823 --> 20:30.925
Part of me thinks that she just...

20:30.926 --> 20:32.726
dreamt up Mr. Stitch as a person

20:32.727 --> 20:34.528
who could be around when I couldn't.

20:34.529 --> 20:36.563
You know, it's funny...

20:36.564 --> 20:39.099
as tough as this whole...

20:39.100 --> 20:41.268
Witness business has been,

20:41.269 --> 20:43.170
it's brought us closer together.

20:43.171 --> 20:45.372
It was the same for Abby and me.

20:45.373 --> 20:48.275
Battling the supernatural
made us sisters again.

20:48.276 --> 20:50.644
And it helped me get over

20:50.645 --> 20:53.480
some serious resentment
I had towards her.

20:57.552 --> 20:58.819
Hey, check this out.

21:01.823 --> 21:04.325
If you're watching this,

21:04.326 --> 21:06.894
it means they got me.

21:06.895 --> 21:08.662
Don't know what it was.

21:08.663 --> 21:10.097
A monster.

21:10.098 --> 21:11.832
Demon.

21:11.833 --> 21:15.736
Doesn't matter how many
hexes or wards you put up,

21:15.737 --> 21:19.606
evil always finds a way.

21:19.607 --> 21:21.942
Funny...

21:21.943 --> 21:24.411
we thought we had all the advantages.

21:24.412 --> 21:26.714
We had the Vault, right?

21:26.715 --> 21:29.883
Washington's legacy.
Centuries of knowledge.

21:29.884 --> 21:32.786
"The last line of defense
against all threats

21:32.787 --> 21:35.255
deemed otherworldly."

21:35.256 --> 21:37.591
But the downside of being
a secret organization

21:37.592 --> 21:40.594
is that people forget about you.

21:40.595 --> 21:43.097
Maybe we did our job too well.

21:43.098 --> 21:44.965
Kept the monsters at bay,

21:44.966 --> 21:47.267
which meant people forgot to be afraid.

21:47.268 --> 21:49.603
They forgot.

21:49.604 --> 21:52.106
But I'll never forget...

21:52.107 --> 21:55.342
about the sacrifices we made,

21:55.343 --> 21:57.578
the blood spilled,

21:57.579 --> 21:59.680
about...

22:02.283 --> 22:04.251
...Michael...

22:05.787 --> 22:07.488
...my friend.

22:07.489 --> 22:10.758
That's why I had to leave the Vault.

22:10.759 --> 22:13.494
To get away from the demons.

22:13.495 --> 22:16.096
And the memories.

22:16.998 --> 22:19.833
Everywhere I turned,

22:19.834 --> 22:21.935
I saw Michael.

22:21.936 --> 22:24.171
But not here.

22:24.172 --> 22:26.874
I know they'll find me.

22:26.875 --> 22:31.512
They always will, because
evil never forgets.

22:31.513 --> 22:34.481
But I'll be ready for them.

22:35.450 --> 22:38.552
I'll be ready.

22:54.502 --> 22:56.070
What you doin'?

22:56.071 --> 22:57.334
Trying to find an escape route.

22:59.707 --> 23:02.543
One must never sit
around and wait for help.

23:02.544 --> 23:04.511
Rescue yourself.

23:04.512 --> 23:07.381
If there's one lesson from
today, let it be that one.

23:07.382 --> 23:09.983
And another lesson is

23:09.984 --> 23:12.920
book cabinets are lighter without books.

23:16.691 --> 23:18.559
Molly...

23:18.560 --> 23:19.793
- Hmm?
- Have you heard

23:19.794 --> 23:22.629
of the legend of Pygmalion?

23:22.630 --> 23:25.065
Uh, yeah, wasn't that an animated movie

23:25.066 --> 23:28.235
- about farm animals?
- An an... What?

23:28.236 --> 23:31.238
No. Pygmalion. P-Y-G... Pyg...

23:31.239 --> 23:34.508
Animated...

23:34.509 --> 23:38.078
Pygmalion was a sculptor,

23:38.079 --> 23:40.347
and he created a statue of a woman,

23:40.348 --> 23:42.416
who he called Galatea.

23:42.417 --> 23:45.385
Now, Galatea was so beautiful,

23:45.386 --> 23:48.021
exquisite,

23:48.022 --> 23:51.191
and Pygmalion fell desperately,

23:51.192 --> 23:53.293
helplessly in love with her.

23:53.294 --> 23:56.964
So he entreated the gods

23:56.965 --> 23:59.166
with all his passion

23:59.167 --> 24:02.169
to bring her to life. "Please."

24:03.371 --> 24:05.506
And they did.

24:05.507 --> 24:07.441
That really happened?

24:07.442 --> 24:09.076
Well, one thing you learn from the Vault

24:09.077 --> 24:11.411
is that all stories have a hint

24:11.412 --> 24:12.913
of truth to them.

24:12.914 --> 24:16.216
Pygmalion is a story of creation,

24:16.217 --> 24:20.854
about how artistic
talent and intense emotion

24:20.855 --> 24:23.857
can bring beings to life.

24:23.858 --> 24:26.126
Molly,

24:26.127 --> 24:28.295
a short while ago, your teacher,

24:28.296 --> 24:30.297
Mr. David, was attacked.

24:30.298 --> 24:33.700
He'll be fine. I promise you.

24:33.701 --> 24:37.804
But we believe he was
attacked by a monster.

24:37.805 --> 24:41.341
More precisely, we believe
he was attacked by Mr. Stitch.

24:41.342 --> 24:42.442
What?

24:42.443 --> 24:43.510
I know, I know.

24:43.511 --> 24:46.346
This comes as a shock.
This is important.

24:46.347 --> 24:49.583
Have you dabbled with anything
involving magic lately?

24:49.584 --> 24:52.085
- Like the symbols you drew
in your notebook. - No.

24:52.086 --> 24:53.587
No, I've been really careful.

24:53.588 --> 24:54.821
Really careful. I...

24:54.822 --> 24:56.423
It's all right, it's all right.

24:56.424 --> 24:58.258
I believe you.

24:58.259 --> 25:01.862
Here, let's set aside how
Mr. Stitch came into being,

25:01.863 --> 25:05.365
and together we will focus
on where he's going next,

25:05.366 --> 25:07.034
yes?

25:07.035 --> 25:10.270
Why do you think Mr.
Stitch went after Mr. David?

25:10.271 --> 25:12.906
Well, Mr. Stitch is not evil.

25:12.907 --> 25:15.242
He wouldn't hurt someone for no reason.

25:15.243 --> 25:18.312
And especially not Mr.
David. I like Mr. David.

25:18.313 --> 25:19.813
I-I mean, I really like him.

25:19.814 --> 25:21.815
- I wouldn't...
- Well, sometimes the people

25:21.816 --> 25:23.450
we like the most are the people

25:23.451 --> 25:25.586
- who upset us the most.
- No!

25:25.587 --> 25:27.588
I'm not mad at Mr. David!

25:27.589 --> 25:30.490
No.

25:30.491 --> 25:33.393
Molly, Mr. David is speaking to you.

25:36.864 --> 25:40.267
She thinks she's helping
me, but she's not.

25:40.268 --> 25:42.469
"She"?

25:42.470 --> 25:46.340
She thinks she knows what
I'm feeling, but she doesn't.

25:46.341 --> 25:48.642
She says we should be
honest with each other,

25:48.643 --> 25:51.244
but she's the one who was lying.

26:14.049 --> 26:16.383
- Go, go, go, go!
- Oh, my God.

26:30.628 --> 26:33.330
- Are you okay?
- I think... I'm good.

26:42.707 --> 26:44.775
Where'd it go?

26:46.711 --> 26:50.614
In Molly's stories, Mr. Stitch
had to go to bed at night,

26:50.615 --> 26:52.282
to hibernate at sundown.

26:52.283 --> 26:56.020
Huh. Saved by bedtime.

26:56.021 --> 26:57.341
We're okay. Apparently that thing

26:57.365 --> 26:58.636
is gonna lay low for the night.

26:58.637 --> 27:01.058
Yeah, I'll fill her in. Okay, will do.

27:01.059 --> 27:02.393
So, Crane has some theories

27:02.394 --> 27:04.395
on this thing's behavioral patterns.

27:04.396 --> 27:06.430
He thinks a basic summoning ritual

27:06.431 --> 27:08.365
will draw it out of hiding.

27:08.366 --> 27:10.868
This image comes up a lot.

27:10.869 --> 27:12.903
That looks like
Shenandoah Amusement Park.

27:12.904 --> 27:15.247
Molly used to love that place.
Closed down a few years ago.

27:15.248 --> 27:18.108
Okay, well, Mr. Stitch could
still be drawn to the site.

27:18.109 --> 27:19.943
Well, it's just west of here.

27:19.944 --> 27:22.513
All right. So, Crane talked to Molly?

27:22.514 --> 27:24.415
Yeah. He thinks that
this is an Id Monster.

27:24.416 --> 27:27.584
Something that's motivated
by the primal instincts

27:27.585 --> 27:29.653
of Molly's psyche. But
she's not controlling it.

27:29.654 --> 27:31.655
But it's acting off of
thoughts in her brain,

27:31.656 --> 27:33.357
so why did it come to our house?

27:33.358 --> 27:35.793
Well, it's trying to protect her.

27:35.794 --> 27:40.264
It's going after those
for whom she has...

27:40.265 --> 27:42.065
negative emotions.

27:45.437 --> 27:48.439
But, look, we're talking
about the id here.

27:48.440 --> 27:51.675
This is a deep, dark stew of impulses

27:51.676 --> 27:53.477
and instincts and crazy thoughts.

27:53.478 --> 27:55.341
And somewhere in there,
my daughter is thinking

27:55.342 --> 27:57.347
- that she hates me.
- No.

27:57.348 --> 27:58.982
She doesn't hate you.

27:58.983 --> 28:00.484
She loves you.

28:00.485 --> 28:02.319
She loves you so much
that she can't tell you

28:02.320 --> 28:03.794
about all this that's bothering her,

28:03.795 --> 28:05.258
because she knows it would hurt you.

28:05.259 --> 28:06.957
So instead

28:06.958 --> 28:09.726
a monster from her
imagination's gonna hurt me.

28:10.762 --> 28:12.096
Actually, if you think about it,

28:12.097 --> 28:14.098
- you're lucky.
- Lucky.

28:14.099 --> 28:16.667
Yeah. Look, it's hard enough for anyone,

28:16.668 --> 28:20.104
let alone an 11-year-old
girl, to tell you

28:20.105 --> 28:22.272
exactly how she feels.

28:22.273 --> 28:23.856
Well, here's something bigger than life

28:23.857 --> 28:25.442
sending you a message.

28:25.443 --> 28:27.444
You sure

28:27.445 --> 28:30.047
this is everything Claudia had
on the Vault's infrastructure?

28:30.048 --> 28:32.182
Yeah. Everything I could
dig out of that mess.

28:33.751 --> 28:36.553
I think I found something.

28:36.554 --> 28:39.056
Wait, these are the glyphs she added.

28:39.057 --> 28:41.024
They're Norse-based!

28:41.025 --> 28:43.093
- Mm.
- Wait, hold on.

28:43.094 --> 28:44.728
According to these plans, the actuators

28:44.729 --> 28:46.730
are both magical and physical.

28:46.731 --> 28:47.495
Meaning?

28:47.496 --> 28:49.733
That reading the symbols
isn't gonna open the doors.

28:49.734 --> 28:51.668
It'll just allow you to access a servo

28:51.669 --> 28:53.170
that controls these barriers.

28:53.171 --> 28:54.538
Where's the servo located?

28:54.539 --> 28:58.108
In a utility duct, behind the west wall.

28:58.109 --> 29:00.210
There's an entry point
from inside the Vault.

29:00.211 --> 29:02.880
And there's one other problem...

29:08.186 --> 29:11.855
Was Claudia Russell a Lilliputian?!

29:11.856 --> 29:14.725
Is there any way to widen the opening?

29:14.726 --> 29:17.194
Not without heavier tools.

29:17.195 --> 29:19.630
Miss Alex, do you have
anything that might assist

29:19.631 --> 29:21.899
- in that regard?
- Well, I have some of that HMX

29:21.900 --> 29:24.835
that we used to cut you out
of Despair's cave, but...

29:24.836 --> 29:27.004
I wouldn't mess with
that in an enclosed space.

29:27.005 --> 29:29.573
I mean, the concussive blast
could make your heads implode.

29:29.574 --> 29:34.211
Right. Well, we'll call
that plan B, shall we?

29:34.212 --> 29:35.913
I can go.

29:35.914 --> 29:38.849
I'll fit. It's just like
the jungle gyms at school.

29:38.850 --> 29:40.617
No. Absolutely not.

29:40.618 --> 29:41.952
Actually, the servo's only about

29:41.953 --> 29:43.616
30 feet from the
opening. So you'd be able

29:43.617 --> 29:45.122
to talk to her the entire time.

29:45.123 --> 29:47.558
Uh, I want to do this.

29:47.559 --> 29:50.194
This whole thing is sort of my fault.

29:50.195 --> 29:52.896
No, it is not. And you
must never think that.

29:52.897 --> 29:55.632
Well, didn't you say that
we should rescue ourselves?

29:55.633 --> 29:58.402
That's what we must always do?

30:00.538 --> 30:04.741
Your mother is going to
have my guts for garters.

30:10.648 --> 30:13.116
I'm going down!

30:14.319 --> 30:15.852
Go ahead, Master Jake!

30:18.623 --> 30:19.957
Ur.

30:19.958 --> 30:21.425
Permanence.

30:22.360 --> 30:24.528
Hagal.

30:24.529 --> 30:27.431
Protection.

30:27.432 --> 30:28.665
Sig.

30:28.666 --> 30:30.534
Victory.

30:30.535 --> 30:32.369
Fa.

30:32.370 --> 30:34.938
Spirit.

30:38.009 --> 30:39.876
I see it!

31:37.735 --> 31:39.736
Last one's stuck!

31:39.737 --> 31:42.005
What's that?!

31:42.006 --> 31:45.142
The last one is stuck!

31:52.717 --> 31:54.651
Hang on!

31:54.652 --> 31:56.420
I think there might be another way out!

31:56.421 --> 31:58.355
Molly?!

32:09.901 --> 32:11.201
Molly!

32:13.504 --> 32:15.706
Molly!

32:15.707 --> 32:18.642
Molly, where are you?!

32:20.378 --> 32:22.412
Master Jake,

32:22.413 --> 32:25.248
I believe Molly is making
her way outside on her own.

32:25.249 --> 32:27.553
That could only lead to the
alley that's on the west side.

32:27.554 --> 32:29.655
Crane, we're on our way.

32:59.250 --> 33:00.927
Hello, Molly.

33:09.034 --> 33:11.576
Crane says that a simple
decomposition spell conducted

33:11.577 --> 33:14.316
within a ten-meter radius of
the creature should do the trick.

33:14.317 --> 33:18.053
I will never get used to
what you guys think is simple.

33:18.054 --> 33:20.522
There.

33:24.727 --> 33:27.762
- Do I know you?
- You know, it does kind of

33:27.763 --> 33:29.864
feel like we already know each other.

33:29.865 --> 33:31.967
We do have a number of mutual friends.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.501
My name is Malcolm.

33:33.502 --> 33:35.704
- Molly.
- Yes, you are.

33:35.705 --> 33:39.274
I have heard so much about you.

33:39.275 --> 33:42.177
You are very special, my friend.

33:42.178 --> 33:43.545
I am?

33:43.546 --> 33:45.213
Oh, yes.

33:45.214 --> 33:48.283
If I have any gifts at
all, I would have to say

33:48.284 --> 33:50.485
my greatest gift

33:50.486 --> 33:53.288
is my affinity for recognizing talent.

33:53.289 --> 33:56.324
And it couldn't be
any more evident to me

33:56.325 --> 33:59.394
that you are blessed

33:59.395 --> 34:04.366
with an extraordinary capacity
for creativity and vision.

34:04.367 --> 34:06.267
Um, how did you say you knew me?

34:06.268 --> 34:07.969
I have been

34:07.970 --> 34:11.339
following your progress...
your remarkable progress...

34:11.340 --> 34:13.007
for quite a while now, Molly.

34:13.009 --> 34:15.443
But let me ask you something, my friend.

34:15.444 --> 34:17.779
Would you say

34:17.780 --> 34:20.148
you're happy?

34:20.149 --> 34:22.650
See, I ask because

34:22.650 --> 34:25.053
I don't think you are.

34:25.054 --> 34:26.888
I think you know,

34:26.889 --> 34:29.290
deep down...

34:29.291 --> 34:31.960
something's not right.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.862
Something with you,
something with your family,

34:34.864 --> 34:36.998
something with the world.

34:36.998 --> 34:38.565
And that's why

34:38.567 --> 34:40.068
I felt such a great urgency

34:40.069 --> 34:41.569
to finally come and meet you,

34:41.570 --> 34:44.072
because I just wanted
to let you know this.

34:44.072 --> 34:47.542
It's gonna get better, Molly.

34:47.543 --> 34:50.712
I think I need to find my friends.

34:50.713 --> 34:52.147
Yes, yes.

34:52.148 --> 34:54.482
Of course. Of course. It was so nice

34:54.483 --> 34:56.384
to finally get to meet you, Molly.

34:56.385 --> 34:59.254
I'll see you soon.

35:00.990 --> 35:03.491
- Molly!
- Oh, thank goodness.

35:03.492 --> 35:06.861
Are you okay?

35:06.862 --> 35:08.496
Yeah.

35:08.497 --> 35:10.432
- Okay. Come on.
- Yeah?

35:10.433 --> 35:12.534
Your mom... she's gonna want to see you.

35:12.535 --> 35:16.037
She'll be wrapping stuff
up shortly, all right?

35:31.587 --> 35:34.222
Sad to see this thing go.

35:34.223 --> 35:35.924
It's either that, or Mr. Stitch

35:35.925 --> 35:39.327
lives to see another day.

35:42.498 --> 35:45.333
Once the ritual's finished,
we should be rid of this thing.

35:46.836 --> 35:49.904
Clio. Euterpe.

35:49.905 --> 35:51.439
Thalia.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.522
Keep going. I'm gonna distract it.

36:07.523 --> 36:09.524
Clio...

36:56.839 --> 36:57.939
No!

36:57.940 --> 36:59.107
Stop!

37:01.443 --> 37:02.944
Molly! Stay back!

37:02.945 --> 37:06.614
I'm sorry I brought you here.

37:06.615 --> 37:08.683
I didn't mean to.

37:08.684 --> 37:11.419
I guess I just needed
someone to talk to.

37:11.420 --> 37:13.521
You were always the one who listened.

37:15.424 --> 37:17.349
I guess I should have
been talking to you, Mom.

37:20.896 --> 37:22.697
Oh, my God.

37:22.698 --> 37:24.699
I still need to finish the ritual.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.634
Blanket.

37:26.635 --> 37:29.470
Honey, you can talk to me
whenever you want, I promise.

37:29.471 --> 37:31.172
I want to tell you that...

37:31.173 --> 37:32.807
I don't like it

37:32.808 --> 37:35.843
when you say that
everything's going to be okay,

37:35.844 --> 37:39.013
even though I know that it's not.

37:39.014 --> 37:42.717
I don't like it when
you keep things from me.

37:42.718 --> 37:44.719
You're angry with me.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.655
Yes, but I don't want to be.

37:47.656 --> 37:50.258
You can be angry. It's good to be angry.

37:50.259 --> 37:51.974
Then you can let it all out.

37:51.975 --> 37:54.143
Come here.

37:58.533 --> 38:01.635
Clio...

38:17.485 --> 38:19.686
Good-bye.

38:52.427 --> 38:55.083
It shouldn't be long now, Mr. Crane!

38:55.084 --> 38:58.620
Jenny's in the duct as we speak!

38:58.621 --> 39:00.684
You are still not getting
the hang of this, are you?

39:00.685 --> 39:02.886
I await with alacrity.

39:04.961 --> 39:06.828
What do you want to do with these?

39:06.829 --> 39:08.430
Those are valuable documents

39:08.431 --> 39:09.965
regarding the history of the Vault.

39:09.966 --> 39:13.802
And a tale of sadness and woe.

39:13.803 --> 39:15.570
Soon to be our tale.

39:15.571 --> 39:17.839
Whoa.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.175
Oh, that is dark, even for you.

39:20.176 --> 39:23.345
You saw her tape. You
saw Claudia's tape.

39:23.346 --> 39:24.980
I mean, you can train to be

39:24.981 --> 39:26.334
a super Vault agent all you want,

39:26.335 --> 39:27.878
but that is what is in store for us...

39:27.879 --> 39:29.618
holed up in a shack eating canned beans,

39:29.619 --> 39:31.002
waiting for the boogeyman to come.

39:31.003 --> 39:32.387
No. We don't know exactly

39:32.388 --> 39:33.688
what happened to Claudia.

39:33.689 --> 39:36.291
Okay? And we're different.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.460
We got Crane, Diana, Jenny.

39:38.461 --> 39:41.730
- She had Michael and then lost him.
- No, but that's not

39:41.731 --> 39:43.465
gonna happen to us.

39:43.466 --> 39:47.636
Look, you and me...

39:47.637 --> 39:50.939
we started this together,
and we'll end it together.

39:53.576 --> 39:56.077
Right.

40:00.883 --> 40:02.751
Thank you.

40:02.752 --> 40:04.452
Quiet contemplation

40:04.453 --> 40:06.454
had grown quite contemptuous.

40:06.455 --> 40:09.057
Do you have the items I require?

40:13.296 --> 40:17.198
Wonton soup, mushu pork, sesame noodles.

40:17.199 --> 40:19.134
The delights of the Far East.

40:19.135 --> 40:20.869
Capital work, Master Wells.

40:25.775 --> 40:29.044
Man, Crane can really pack
that Szechuan chicken away.

40:29.045 --> 40:32.213
Guess Chinese takeout
was far and few between

40:32.214 --> 40:34.082
in the 18th century.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.216
What are you doing?

40:35.217 --> 40:37.320
Molly left her backpack here.

40:37.321 --> 40:38.989
I moved it, and this fell out.

40:38.990 --> 40:42.358
Yeah. It's an E-reader. So?

40:43.828 --> 40:47.230
Does that mean anything to you?

40:47.231 --> 40:48.498
It's a Wiccan hex.

40:48.499 --> 40:49.833
Do you know what it does?

40:49.834 --> 40:51.468
No. What's it doing in Molly's stuff?

40:51.469 --> 40:53.003
"Courtesy of Little Readers of D.C."?

40:53.004 --> 40:54.437
Yeah, I looked it up.

40:54.438 --> 40:57.140
Little Readers donated these
devices to public schools.

40:57.141 --> 40:58.875
And guess who's head of the charity.

40:58.876 --> 41:00.710
Who?

41:01.979 --> 41:04.047
Malcolm Dreyfuss.

41:04.048 --> 41:06.349
I think Molly was targeted specifically.

41:06.350 --> 41:07.650
Dreyfuss planted

41:07.651 --> 41:09.052
a magically charged device on her.

41:09.053 --> 41:10.887
That's what conjured the monster.

41:10.888 --> 41:14.424
But why? I mean, what could
he possibly want with her?

41:21.499 --> 41:24.934
Dreyfuss has totally gone
off the deep end this time.

41:24.935 --> 41:28.038
I mean, he's always been crazy,
but shutting down the company?

41:28.039 --> 41:29.739
The stock is gonna drop like a rock.

41:29.740 --> 41:32.375
I don't know if he cares about
that kind of stuff anymore.

41:32.376 --> 41:33.400
Why not?

41:33.401 --> 41:36.503
I get the feeling he's got
his eyes on a different prize.

41:40.251 --> 41:42.585
You've caused quite a stir.

41:42.586 --> 41:45.955
I've been reading about the
philosophy of decluttering.

41:45.956 --> 41:49.826
The idea is to evaluate
every possession in your life

41:49.827 --> 41:52.729
and ask yourself, "Does
this still bring me joy?"

41:52.730 --> 41:55.265
And if not, you got to let it go.

41:55.266 --> 41:57.734
I've seen my future, Jobe.

41:57.735 --> 41:59.602
It's time to make it a reality.

41:59.603 --> 42:00.770
No more distractions.

42:00.771 --> 42:02.038
I need every resource I've got

42:02.039 --> 42:03.506
to move on to the next phase.

42:03.507 --> 42:06.543
Speaking of which, how is the
rest of my team coming along?

42:06.544 --> 42:10.813
The second recruit is...
ready to be plucked soon.

42:14.085 --> 42:15.518
And the girl?

42:15.519 --> 42:17.087
Now that you've met,

42:17.088 --> 42:19.322
do you have a better idea
of what to do with her?

42:19.323 --> 42:24.894
I didn't realize how
important she would be

42:24.895 --> 42:27.897
until I actually saw her.

42:27.898 --> 42:32.068
I knew she would mean
a lot to me, but...

42:32.069 --> 42:34.737
what I didn't...

42:34.738 --> 42:37.540
couldn't know was...

42:39.643 --> 42:42.078
...was how much I could mean to her.

42:50.221 --> 42:55.091
After all, what little
girl doesn't need a real...

42:55.092 --> 42:58.528
father... in her life?

42:58.688 --> 43:02.934
