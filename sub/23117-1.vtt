00:46.306 --> 00:48.288
This show has taken us to many

00:48.318 --> 00:50.544
exotic locales in our lives,

00:50.574 --> 00:52.800
but none as exotic, as scenic,

00:54.060 --> 00:57.503
oh yeah, there it is, New Jersey.

00:57.533 --> 01:00.074
Zombie guy is just perfect for this.

01:00.104 --> 01:02.646
He's as excited as we are to go to

01:02.676 --> 01:04.941
the New Jersey Pine Barrens.

01:04.971 --> 01:07.238
Who's ready to meet some Pineys?

01:07.268 --> 01:09.157
- Hello again.
- Oh yeah.

01:09.187 --> 01:10.387
Again?

01:11.023 --> 01:12.819
- It's our next episode.
- Nobody remembers you.

01:12.849 --> 01:14.533
Hey.

01:14.563 --> 01:16.438
I don't want to be on camera.

01:16.468 --> 01:17.241
Oh, come on.

01:17.271 --> 01:20.048
This is our-our lovely
and talented friend, Lucy.

01:20.078 --> 01:22.869
Who uh, who is kind enough to uh,

01:22.899 --> 01:24.528
drive us to drop off points,

01:24.558 --> 01:26.389
and then wait to pick us back up.

01:26.419 --> 01:29.411
And uh, uh, she basically eats the food

01:29.441 --> 01:30.409
we don't get to eat...

01:30.439 --> 01:32.175
For the 21 days.

01:32.205 --> 01:34.441
Is this your first time in
the New Jersey Pine Barrens?

01:34.471 --> 01:35.244
It is, actually.

01:35.274 --> 01:36.216
Yeah, yeah, first time.

01:36.246 --> 01:37.940
It's, it's a lifelong
goal of mine actually.

01:37.970 --> 01:40.334
It was on my bucket list
for places I wanted to go.

01:40.364 --> 01:41.137
So...

01:41.167 --> 01:42.700
I used to date a
girl in Edison, New Jersey.

01:42.730 --> 01:43.666
But we don't want to talk about that.

01:43.696 --> 01:47.833
So uh...

01:49.946 --> 01:51.146
All right.

01:51.176 --> 01:52.258
And action.

01:52.288 --> 01:54.691
Hello, and welcome to
a very special episode of

01:54.721 --> 01:55.494
Road to Nowhere.

01:55.524 --> 01:56.732
I'm your host, Dallas Collins.

01:56.762 --> 01:58.393
And I'm Hank Souza.

01:58.423 --> 01:59.541
And we are here in the heart

01:59.571 --> 02:01.887
of the Pine Barrens
wilderness in New Jersey.

02:01.917 --> 02:03.773
A vast stretch of untamed wilderness

02:03.803 --> 02:05.171
where for the next 21 days,

02:05.201 --> 02:06.786
we will be attempting to survive

02:06.816 --> 02:08.336
off nothing but the wilderness.

02:08.366 --> 02:09.856
You know, a lot of people,

02:09.886 --> 02:11.649
when they think about New Jersey,

02:11.679 --> 02:13.560
they think of smog, highways,

02:13.590 --> 02:15.441
and that one movie by Zach Braff,

02:15.471 --> 02:18.214
but there's actually a bustling wilderness

02:18.244 --> 02:21.684
that can be very dangerous
in the Garden State, uh,

02:21.714 --> 02:24.309
far more scary than any Kevin
Smith movie you've ever seen.

02:24.339 --> 02:27.495
This is also a very, very
special episode because

02:27.525 --> 02:29.413
for the first time on this show,

02:29.443 --> 02:32.341
we will be entering an
area of the wilderness

02:32.371 --> 02:33.975
that is supposedly haunted.

02:34.005 --> 02:35.607
And we'll be discussing
some of those urban legends

02:35.637 --> 02:36.773
coming up shortly.

02:36.803 --> 02:38.831
And uh, hopefully this
will be airing in October

02:38.861 --> 02:40.383
so it can be our Halloween episode,

02:40.413 --> 02:41.906
our first ever Halloween episode.

02:41.936 --> 02:44.203
Uh, and if it isn't, then
man, those executives at

02:44.233 --> 02:45.570
the Home and Garden Channel,

02:45.600 --> 02:47.249
you're really slippin', folks.

02:47.279 --> 02:48.898
Get a grip on your audience.

02:48.928 --> 02:50.953
As part of our 21 day survival challenge,

02:50.983 --> 02:53.008
we've been allowed three personal items

02:53.038 --> 02:54.282
to help with survival.

02:54.312 --> 02:56.436
Now, I want to mention that
these three personal items

02:56.466 --> 02:58.590
are very important because
any advantage you could have

02:58.620 --> 03:00.594
in the wilderness could
be the difference between

03:00.624 --> 03:02.526
life or death.
- Yes it would.

03:02.556 --> 03:04.887
But, other than these
three personal items,

03:04.917 --> 03:06.669
and flashlights, which we were allotted

03:06.699 --> 03:07.575
because without light,

03:07.605 --> 03:08.926
we're just dead in the woods.
- Yeah.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.112
Um, other than these items,

03:10.142 --> 03:13.267
we have nothing more than
what a backpacker would have

03:13.297 --> 03:14.901
if they had intended to
be out for an afternoon

03:14.931 --> 03:16.458
and ended up stuck for a week.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.811
So uh, Dallas, why don't you
show them what you've got?

03:18.841 --> 03:23.440
Yeah, so today, I have brought
my knife/flint firestarter,

03:23.470 --> 03:25.838
I have my military grade compass,

03:25.868 --> 03:29.087
and I have brought my lucky slingshot.

03:30.882 --> 03:32.082
Nice.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.799
Well, I have brought...

03:34.829 --> 03:36.606
My utility knife.

03:36.636 --> 03:38.484
Very, very important
to always have a knife.

03:38.514 --> 03:40.332
- Absolutely.
- Both of us need a knife.

03:40.362 --> 03:42.446
Knives ar every important,
they're all-purpose tools,

03:42.476 --> 03:45.512
and they allow you to very much survive.

03:45.542 --> 03:48.579
So I have my knife, and I have a canteen,

03:48.609 --> 03:50.270
for gathering water, obviously.

03:50.300 --> 03:51.837
Uh, water is extremely important,

03:51.867 --> 03:53.069
much more important than food.

03:53.099 --> 03:54.272
A lot of people think that

03:54.302 --> 03:56.064
they need to obtain food immediately.

03:56.094 --> 03:58.486
You can live two weeks,
three weeks without food.

03:58.516 --> 04:00.512
But water, you've got days.

04:00.542 --> 04:02.032
So I have this canteen here...
- Absolutely.

04:02.062 --> 04:03.060
So we can get the basics,

04:03.090 --> 04:04.524
because we want to have fresh water first.

04:04.554 --> 04:05.327
Mmhmm.

04:05.357 --> 04:07.983
Then we'll want to attempt
to obtain shelter and food.

04:08.013 --> 04:10.477
- That's right.
- And then of course,

04:10.507 --> 04:12.971
the most important element, my sunglasses.

04:13.001 --> 04:14.054
Sunglasses.

04:14.084 --> 04:15.138
Survival gear.

04:15.168 --> 04:15.941
Nice.

04:15.971 --> 04:16.774
I have sensitive eyes.

04:16.803 --> 04:19.724
Do you want a blind partner

04:19.754 --> 04:21.153
in the woods?

04:21.183 --> 04:22.604
Uh, not necessarily.

04:22.634 --> 04:24.195
I think that'll put a damper on my trip.

04:24.225 --> 04:24.998
Well, and if it makes,

04:25.028 --> 04:26.668
if it makes you feel
better at home, folks,

04:26.698 --> 04:28.339
uh, these sunglasses are about as useful

04:28.369 --> 04:29.569
as his slingshot.

04:30.097 --> 04:31.637
My slingshot is very, very useful.

04:31.667 --> 04:34.767
I have hit many, many
things with my slingshot.

04:34.797 --> 04:35.853
Your knuckles don't count.

04:35.883 --> 04:38.169
But now, we need to go
further into the woods

04:38.199 --> 04:41.994
and eventually find the right
campsite for our first night

04:42.024 --> 04:45.219
in these spooky, haunted, witch's woods.

04:45.249 --> 04:46.044
That's right.

04:46.074 --> 04:48.311
And we're gonna talk a
little bit more about the uh,

04:48.341 --> 04:51.413
the stories behind the
New Jersey Pine Barrens

04:51.443 --> 04:52.271
in just a minute.

04:52.301 --> 04:55.218
But first, I got to scratch my ass.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.540
They're not gonna use that part, I'm sure.

04:57.570 --> 04:58.343
I just...
- No.

04:58.373 --> 04:59.617
I just thought that
that would be, you know?

04:59.647 --> 05:00.983
I'm not gonna scratch your ass.

05:01.013 --> 05:02.350
One of the biggest legends...

05:02.380 --> 05:03.676
Oh, dude, dude, dude.

05:03.706 --> 05:05.002
Take off your sunglasses.

05:06.213 --> 05:07.851
Take off the sunglasses, dude.

05:07.881 --> 05:09.279
One of the most famous
legends surrounding the

05:09.309 --> 05:12.779
New Jersey Pine Barrens is
of course the Jersey Devil.

05:12.809 --> 05:15.557
A story of Mother Leeds in the early 1700s

05:15.587 --> 05:19.841
who had 12 children and said
if she had a 13th child,

05:19.871 --> 05:21.940
"May it be born a devil."

05:21.970 --> 05:24.009
And apparently, it sure was.

05:24.039 --> 05:26.584
And since then, the Pine
Barrens in particular

05:26.614 --> 05:29.159
have been haunted by this
creature with hooves,

05:29.189 --> 05:32.326
wings, and terrifying red, beady eyes.

05:33.398 --> 05:37.559
Now, that being said, it's
very important that I point out

05:37.589 --> 05:39.710
that in the state of New Jersey,

05:39.740 --> 05:42.806
there is a high population of cranes.

05:42.836 --> 05:45.873
And cranes, if you look at a picture,

05:45.903 --> 05:47.609
they kind of look a lot
like what people describe

05:47.639 --> 05:48.862
as the Jersey Devil.

05:48.892 --> 05:51.569
So most people, most
skeptics, myself included,

05:51.599 --> 05:54.719
have dismissed the Jersey
Devil pretty much entirely as

05:54.749 --> 05:57.319
people seeing cranes at night because

05:57.349 --> 05:58.655
if you look at the woods,

05:58.685 --> 06:00.817
you're gonna notice, they
seem, they seem pretty affable,

06:00.847 --> 06:03.334
pretty nice, even on a gloomy October day.

06:03.364 --> 06:04.687
But I'll tell you right now,

06:04.717 --> 06:07.808
and you will find out
shortly in the program,

06:07.838 --> 06:10.929
when the sun goes down,
these woods became...

06:10.959 --> 06:13.494
these,
we can put a cut in there.

06:13.524 --> 06:16.060
These woods become very, very scary.

06:17.662 --> 06:18.862
I think that worked.

06:18.892 --> 06:19.983
I like that one.
- Yeah, I think it was,

06:20.013 --> 06:21.104
I think it was fine.
- Yeah, they can cut

06:21.134 --> 06:21.907
that slip up out.

06:21.937 --> 06:22.881
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

06:22.911 --> 06:26.458
Now, why are we discussing
urban legends on a nature show?

06:26.488 --> 06:28.864
Now it's important to remember that fear

06:28.894 --> 06:31.308
is your number one enemy out here.

06:31.338 --> 06:33.648
People tell stories about the woods

06:33.678 --> 06:35.958
because they're afraid of the unknown,

06:35.988 --> 06:39.247
and that is what gets you
into trouble out here.

06:39.277 --> 06:41.743
Now, you can't go into the
woods worrying about witches

06:41.773 --> 06:43.186
and goblins and demons.

06:43.216 --> 06:45.681
What you really have to
worry about is clean water,

06:45.711 --> 06:47.294
and-and fresh food.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.374
You can't let fear sink in.

06:49.404 --> 06:51.700
The moment you do, you start to panic.

06:51.730 --> 06:55.163
And panic is the number one
reason why people get lost

06:55.193 --> 06:56.911
and they die in the woods.

06:56.941 --> 07:00.390
So we're here to teach
you how to survive using,

07:00.420 --> 07:02.078
you know, just what's in front of you.

07:02.108 --> 07:03.737
How to survive, you know, a bear attack.

07:03.767 --> 07:06.533
How to get clean water,
how to get fresh food.

07:06.563 --> 07:10.516
This is why we're here, to
teach you how to survive.

07:10.546 --> 07:13.605
So how much cash
money do you want to bet

07:13.635 --> 07:16.694
that you can hit anything
other than a tree

07:16.724 --> 07:17.666
with your slingshot?

07:17.696 --> 07:19.691
I'm not placin' bets right now.

07:19.721 --> 07:22.206
Well I mean, obviously,
when we get back,

07:22.236 --> 07:23.572
you're gonna pay.

07:23.602 --> 07:24.897
Uh...

07:24.927 --> 07:26.969
See, he'd be fine with
placing a bet, folks,

07:26.999 --> 07:28.893
if he thought he could win.

07:28.923 --> 07:30.123
$500.

07:30.672 --> 07:31.872
$500.

07:33.050 --> 07:36.201
I will bet you $500 I can hit
something with my slingshot.

07:36.231 --> 07:39.201
You gave me so much crap about that.

07:40.522 --> 07:41.722
Okay, I'll tell you what.

07:41.752 --> 07:44.851
You make it $750, you got a deal.

07:45.300 --> 07:46.500
Sure.

07:46.530 --> 07:49.244
Seven hundred and fitty dollas.

07:49.274 --> 07:51.988
That's what makes me holla.

07:52.018 --> 07:52.791
You're on.

07:52.821 --> 07:53.624
All right.
- Let's do it.

07:53.654 --> 07:54.487
All right, well then we'll shake hands.

07:54.517 --> 07:55.441
I don't like that...
- All right.

07:55.471 --> 07:57.061
I bet you don't wash
'em, but I appreciate it.

08:00.374 --> 08:01.985
Well, we all know you don't like to use

08:02.015 --> 08:05.598
toilet paper out here.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

08:07.122 --> 08:08.322
Oh man...

08:09.527 --> 08:12.110
I'm-I'm getting the camera out.

08:14.380 --> 08:16.047
Look.

08:16.982 --> 08:18.361
Just come on.

08:18.391 --> 08:19.770
One-one second.

08:21.830 --> 08:23.030
Oh my gosh.

08:24.534 --> 08:27.252
I just don't, I can't believe this.

08:27.282 --> 08:28.835
New Jersey's great.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.000
Wow.

08:33.395 --> 08:35.268
Um, ex

08:35.298 --> 08:39.472
Uh, sorry to bother you or
interrupt or whatever it is

08:39.503 --> 08:40.520
that you're doing.

08:40.549 --> 08:43.525
Um, we were just passing through,

08:43.554 --> 08:45.942
and couldn't help but notice...

08:45.972 --> 08:48.359
Whatever it is you're doing.

08:50.467 --> 08:53.073
We-we host a
nature survival show.

08:53.103 --> 08:56.045
I'm-I'm-I'm Hank, and
this is, this is Dallas.

08:56.075 --> 08:59.047
Um, and we are, uh, surviving in the woods

08:59.077 --> 09:01.373
for 21 days in the Pine Barrens.

09:01.403 --> 09:03.559
And uh, uh, w-why are you asking me,

09:03.589 --> 09:06.027
what are you, pardon the intrusion,

09:06.057 --> 09:08.495
but what are you guys doing here?

09:09.527 --> 09:11.554
We're performing a ritual.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.252
Are you Wiccan?

09:13.282 --> 09:16.234
I suppose you'd call us
that in some sense, yeah.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.027
And why are you naked?

09:19.057 --> 09:22.853
The most important rituals
should be performed skyclad.

09:22.883 --> 09:23.686
- Uh...
- Can I talk to you

09:23.716 --> 09:24.489
for a second?

09:24.519 --> 09:27.172
Ex-excuse me one second.

09:27.202 --> 09:28.260
Hank.

09:28.290 --> 09:29.419
No, we can't film this.

09:29.449 --> 09:31.099
- Oh, we can't not film them.
- We can't-we can't film them.

09:31.129 --> 09:32.549
We cannot not film them.

09:32.579 --> 09:33.970
This is, this would never...

09:34.000 --> 09:35.232
With a camera.
- This would never

09:35.262 --> 09:36.464
fly past the censors, this is the

09:36.494 --> 09:37.493
Home and Garden Network.
- Oh that's-that's fair.

09:37.523 --> 09:38.527
Well, you know...
- You can't do it.

09:38.557 --> 09:40.569
The editors may
be blurring it on the show,

09:40.599 --> 09:42.011
and that's fine, but they'll
never blur my memories.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.004
This is a nature show.

09:43.034 --> 09:43.807
The, yeah, the,

09:43.837 --> 09:46.043
this is as nature as it gets, my man.

09:46.073 --> 09:48.725
Just, just trust me this
one time, all right?

09:48.755 --> 09:50.923
I say that every time I get to see you.

09:50.953 --> 09:52.907
Okay, um, I know you uh,

09:52.937 --> 09:56.483
would rather not state
your name, and that's fine.

09:56.513 --> 10:00.060
Um, so, uh, just uh, tell
us a little bit about, um,

10:00.090 --> 10:02.782
yourself, what you're doing here?

10:02.812 --> 10:05.504
Well, what you came upon was uh,

10:05.534 --> 10:08.469
an ancient Etruscan ritual.

10:08.499 --> 10:12.711
We perform sometimes to become impregnated

10:12.741 --> 10:14.794
by the spirit of the air.

10:16.091 --> 10:18.351
Does your, does
your family practice this?

10:18.381 --> 10:19.753
Like, did you grow up with this?

10:19.783 --> 10:22.889
And it kinda became
your belief system or...

10:22.919 --> 10:24.469
This is my family.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.019
This is my home.

10:26.049 --> 10:27.799
Those are my sisters.

10:29.070 --> 10:30.444
This is where I live.

10:30.474 --> 10:32.641
This is where my heart is.

10:34.893 --> 10:37.363
Okay, and uh, are
you currently seeing anyone?

10:40.122 --> 10:41.923
Only the spirit.

10:41.953 --> 10:44.804
It's so much easier to
connect with the spirits

10:44.834 --> 10:47.686
and the essences of the
world around us when

10:47.716 --> 10:50.596
we're not surrounded by TV and radios

10:50.626 --> 10:54.890
and-and televisions and
computers and microwaves.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.763
How do you feel
about the fact that people

10:57.793 --> 10:58.888
call this the witch's woods?

10:58.918 --> 11:00.298
Do you feel like maybe that
has something to do with you

11:00.328 --> 11:02.407
and your, and your coven?

11:02.437 --> 11:05.429
The people of your ilk that come here?

11:05.459 --> 11:08.881
I-I mean this, these
woods have always been

11:08.911 --> 11:12.187
associated with people
who share our practices.

11:12.217 --> 11:15.493
So, I suppose that would
be part of it, yes.

11:15.523 --> 11:17.991
You cannot take the left-hand path.

11:18.021 --> 11:18.821
It is dangerous.

11:18.851 --> 11:20.137
We have a camera
with us though, all right?

11:20.167 --> 11:21.056
You will be hurt.

11:21.086 --> 11:21.889
- We won't...
- You will be hurt.

11:21.919 --> 11:24.101
This land belongs to Franny
Kalikak and her followers.

11:24.131 --> 11:25.779
This is not your place.

11:25.809 --> 11:26.609
You need to go.

11:26.639 --> 11:28.695
So I noticed
that these women klnd of

11:28.725 --> 11:29.795
glom to you a bit.

11:29.825 --> 11:32.513
Are you like their leader or something?

11:32.543 --> 11:36.779
I prefer to think of myself
as a teacher, or guide.

11:36.809 --> 11:38.573
Do you have any
advice for anybody who's,

11:38.603 --> 11:40.003
who's coming to these woods?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.413
They seem very special to you.

11:41.443 --> 11:42.794
Do you have any advice, uh,

11:42.824 --> 11:45.125
for them if they want to
commune with nature here,

11:45.155 --> 11:46.100
like you are?

11:46.130 --> 11:47.330
Go home.

11:50.247 --> 11:53.915
Is that in general, or toward me?

11:53.945 --> 11:56.263
Go somewhere else.

11:56.293 --> 12:00.149
I mean, you ladies
have all expressed to us

12:00.179 --> 12:03.923
consistently that this is a
loving and beautiful place.

12:03.953 --> 12:05.535
But now you're telling me to leave?

12:05.565 --> 12:07.285
Love may be severe.

12:10.139 --> 12:12.293
Okay, well, thank
you girls very, very much.

12:12.323 --> 12:15.831
And uh, maybe we'll see you
on the way out, all right?

12:15.861 --> 12:17.606
Blessed be.

12:17.636 --> 12:20.473
Ex-exactly, thank you.

12:20.503 --> 12:21.773
That was so good!

12:21.803 --> 12:23.003
Oh my God!

12:24.958 --> 12:27.050
Beautiful day for this.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.382
It's not bad.

12:28.412 --> 12:30.911
I-I was, uh, mostly
being facetious because

12:30.941 --> 12:33.328
the clouds look like dog doo.

12:35.082 --> 12:36.875
Uh, that is...

12:36.905 --> 12:40.372
This is the most
inhospitable-looking environment.

12:40.402 --> 12:42.156
I don't think it's the
worst we've ever had.

12:42.186 --> 12:43.332
It's not the worst we've had.

12:43.362 --> 12:45.351
No, no, not by a long shot,

12:45.381 --> 12:47.341
but it's, uh, pretty chilly.

12:47.371 --> 12:49.563
No, this is colder than I expected.

12:49.593 --> 12:52.975
October, I think they
were predicting around

12:53.005 --> 12:54.205
50 is the low.

12:54.696 --> 12:55.896
I think we might be

12:55.926 --> 12:57.485
right at that already.
- Well, yeah.

12:57.515 --> 12:59.235
I think we've hit it.

13:00.103 --> 13:01.303
So um...

13:03.294 --> 13:06.417
I don't want to leave an
elephant in the woods.

13:06.447 --> 13:09.570
But uh, did you know
that woman back there?

13:11.758 --> 13:13.378
Yeah, the...

13:13.408 --> 13:18.258
The one, the one of them, you
seemed really familiar with.

13:18.288 --> 13:20.209
No, no, no, I didn't know her.

13:20.239 --> 13:22.161
No, it was the first time we met.

13:22.191 --> 13:24.078
So I guess, due to...

13:25.603 --> 13:28.475
The weather kind of being a little rough,

13:28.505 --> 13:31.377
and the fact that I don't know how much

13:31.407 --> 13:32.492
daylight we're really gonna have,

13:32.522 --> 13:37.074
I guess we should start
looking for suitable campsites.

13:37.104 --> 13:38.304
Yeah, uh...

13:39.398 --> 13:40.814
Uh, it's not clear enough over here.

13:40.844 --> 13:42.480
I think we need to go a bit further

13:42.510 --> 13:44.116
before we find a suitable spot.

13:44.146 --> 13:45.767
I mean, it should open up a little bit.

13:45.797 --> 13:47.757
At least, I'm hoping that.

13:47.787 --> 13:49.718
I'm hoping lots of things.

13:49.748 --> 13:51.814
First of all, uh, you
want to get some protection

13:51.844 --> 13:52.617
from the elements.

13:52.647 --> 13:54.852
So, make sure you pick a camping spot

13:54.882 --> 13:58.586
that's under some trees
or next to some boulders,

13:58.616 --> 13:59.965
just to get some protection from the,

13:59.995 --> 14:02.195
from the rain and the wind.

14:02.225 --> 14:04.396
Uh, it's also important though,

14:04.426 --> 14:08.118
remember that, uh, not to
camp under some dead trees...

14:08.148 --> 14:10.286
- Yeah.
- In the event of a windstorm.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.454
We had a branch fall on us once in Peru.

14:12.484 --> 14:13.874
Uh huh.

14:13.904 --> 14:14.707
I remember that.
- And he doesn't like to

14:14.737 --> 14:16.333
talk about that, 'cause
he picked that campsite.

14:16.363 --> 14:17.284
I did.

14:17.314 --> 14:18.851
I am very, very guilty of that.

14:18.881 --> 14:20.408
That's the first time he
admitted it, it's on camera.

14:20.438 --> 14:21.241
Well, everything's on camera so...

14:21.271 --> 14:22.907
Everything's on camera.

14:22.937 --> 14:24.105
- So...
- Uh...

14:24.135 --> 14:25.273
Go on, yeah, so...

14:25.303 --> 14:26.612
- You want to also...
- You want underbrush,

14:26.642 --> 14:28.077
but you want the tree to be alive.

14:28.107 --> 14:29.513
You want the tree to be alive.

14:29.543 --> 14:33.623
Uh, also, you want to
camp near water obviously,

14:33.653 --> 14:35.353
uh, to maintain a good water source.

14:35.383 --> 14:37.155
Just make sure you purify it.

14:37.185 --> 14:41.616
Uh, also, uh, make sure you're
at least 200 feet away though

14:41.646 --> 14:43.573
uh, because of flooding.

14:43.603 --> 14:45.130
- Again, Peru.
- If it rains...

14:45.160 --> 14:46.687
Yeah, why do you have to keep

14:46.717 --> 14:48.064
bringing that up?

14:48.094 --> 14:49.412
Peru was miserable!

14:49.442 --> 14:50.337
I know it was miserable.

14:50.367 --> 14:51.601
You don't have to keep
bringing it up though.

14:51.631 --> 14:54.593
The hotel after was miserable!

14:54.623 --> 14:55.843
It was all bad!

14:57.190 --> 14:58.390
Sorry, bru.

14:58.668 --> 14:59.868
Sorry.

14:59.898 --> 15:00.701
Hey, you know what?

15:00.731 --> 15:02.595
I just realized something.

15:02.625 --> 15:04.460
We should do something like,

15:04.490 --> 15:08.114
how about this time, you be
the young, supple Alec Baldwin

15:08.144 --> 15:11.898
and I'll be, uh, the
manly Anthony Hopkins?

15:12.731 --> 15:14.355
Uh, I don't think this is like The Edge.

15:14.385 --> 15:16.009
I think surviving in the wilderness is,

15:16.039 --> 15:17.605
is a little different than that.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.145
"I've gotta kill the motherfucker!"

15:22.175 --> 15:23.223
See...

15:23.253 --> 15:25.359
You know I I
could have been doing a show,

15:25.389 --> 15:27.885
I could have been on Naked
and Afraid with some chick,

15:27.915 --> 15:29.986
and instead, they stuck
me with this idiot.

15:30.016 --> 15:33.525
Naked and Afraid people don't
get paid SAG-minimum scale.

15:36.410 --> 15:38.686
Oh, but really, we'll get naked
later, don't worry about it.

15:38.716 --> 15:40.068
I got you.

15:40.098 --> 15:43.301
Don't, before you head
off into any, uh, forest,

15:43.331 --> 15:45.162
you want to make sure you let people

15:45.192 --> 15:46.693
know where you're going.

15:46.723 --> 15:49.852
If there are any park rangers around,

15:49.882 --> 15:51.827
just go ahead and visit them,

15:51.857 --> 15:55.677
maybe even leave a map, detailing
where you're gonna end up

15:55.707 --> 15:57.549
just so that, you know,
everyone knows where you are

15:57.579 --> 15:58.352
at all times.

15:58.382 --> 16:01.293
Yeah, one thing you always
want to have is a map.

16:01.323 --> 16:02.643
Of course, we don't have a map

16:02.673 --> 16:04.113
because we are lost.
- We don't have a map.

16:04.143 --> 16:05.563
We are officially lost, that's not us,

16:05.593 --> 16:07.114
that's what we're after.
- We are lost, that's

16:07.144 --> 16:08.490
kind of the goal.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.293
But you...

16:09.323 --> 16:11.179
You absolutely want to talk to people

16:11.209 --> 16:13.277
who know about the area
you're gonna be hiking

16:13.307 --> 16:14.637
or camping in.

16:14.667 --> 16:18.163
Uh, that's a very important element.

16:18.193 --> 16:22.611
It's really important to uh,
keep in mind the fact that

16:22.641 --> 16:24.502
woods tend to all look the same.

16:24.532 --> 16:26.721
- Yeah.
- Uh, and that's why

16:26.751 --> 16:28.910
it's so easy to get lost.

16:28.940 --> 16:31.026
Uh, most people who get lost in the woods,

16:31.056 --> 16:35.046
uh, are expecting to be
there maybe a whole day,

16:35.076 --> 16:38.467
maybe with a sleeping bag
or a tent just in case

16:38.497 --> 16:41.599
because they might, you
know, think it would be fun

16:41.629 --> 16:45.423
to stay the night and then
come back in the morning.

16:45.453 --> 16:48.316
But the fact is, these trails,
if you look at them they,

16:48.346 --> 16:51.210
they all blend together and
they start to look the same,

16:51.240 --> 16:52.335
very quickly.

16:52.365 --> 16:53.431
Absolutely.

16:53.461 --> 16:55.080
So if you're hiking and
you don't know what direction

16:55.110 --> 16:58.906
you're going in, you're pretty
much guaranteed to be lost.

16:58.936 --> 16:59.709
- That's why...
- Luckily...

16:59.739 --> 17:02.001
That's why it's really important
to have a compass as well

17:02.031 --> 17:03.357
and even if you don't have one,

17:03.387 --> 17:06.951
or in, even in addition
to having a compass,

17:06.981 --> 17:08.827
even if-if you're alone out here,

17:08.857 --> 17:11.048
you know, if you have
something you can tie to a tree

17:11.078 --> 17:13.520
or make a marker on, go ahead and do that,

17:13.550 --> 17:15.569
it'll-it'll mark where you've been.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.483
You know, in case you need
to return the same way.

17:17.513 --> 17:21.116
Nothing would be stupider
than traveling without a compass

17:21.146 --> 17:22.424
in the woods.

17:22.454 --> 17:23.511
Do your magic, man.

17:23.540 --> 17:27.666
All right, so, there are
many, many ways to start a fire

17:27.696 --> 17:28.508
once you're out camping.

17:28.538 --> 17:31.731
My personal preference
is the flint firestarter.

17:31.761 --> 17:34.955
Uh, it can be a little
frustrating, depending.

17:34.985 --> 17:36.048
I mean, it can take a little while.

17:36.078 --> 17:39.742
This wood is a little wet, so
we'll give it our best shot

17:39.772 --> 17:41.742
and we'll see how we do.

17:42.592 --> 17:44.412
I mean, you're frustrating
and we keep you around so...

17:44.442 --> 17:45.892
I know, yeah.

17:55.838 --> 17:59.921
The key is to get a good
spark in the kindling.

18:02.196 --> 18:04.914
The other key is to try not
to bore the audience at home.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.681
I am, I'm being very boring right now.

18:08.711 --> 18:11.206
Well, I'd rather be bored than cold.

18:11.236 --> 18:12.618
That's very true.

18:12.648 --> 18:13.554
And I do want to mention,

18:13.584 --> 18:15.658
I don't know if this
is gonna be consistent,

18:15.688 --> 18:20.316
but it is getting, uh, a bit
colder than we were expecting,

18:20.346 --> 18:21.800
which is something you have to expect

18:21.830 --> 18:22.980
when you're out in the wild.

18:23.010 --> 18:26.324
Things aren't gonna go
exactly the way you plan.

18:26.354 --> 18:27.804
And uh, we thought it was gonna be warmer

18:27.834 --> 18:29.791
than it actually is.

18:29.821 --> 18:31.732
So we need this fire very, very badly.

18:31.762 --> 18:32.962
We have...

18:33.472 --> 18:35.842
Maybe 40 minutes of sun left.

18:35.872 --> 18:37.724
Just about, yeah.

18:37.754 --> 18:40.690
Well like I said folks,
this can take quite a while.

18:41.574 --> 18:44.459
Well, I think after our
failure finding the water,

18:44.489 --> 18:47.374
we're going to accept
no other failures today.

18:47.404 --> 18:49.298
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Oh, there's a good spark.

18:49.328 --> 18:50.280
Oh, oh, oh!

18:50.310 --> 18:51.143
- There we go.
- Okay, we got it.

18:51.173 --> 18:51.946
We got a little bit of flame.

18:51.976 --> 18:52.794
- Got a little...
- It's very small.

18:52.824 --> 18:53.612
You gotta feed it.
- Uh, we're still,

18:53.642 --> 18:54.559
yeah, we're good, yeah.
- You wanna blow on the flame

18:54.589 --> 18:55.789
a little bit.

18:56.514 --> 18:57.764
Try to feed it.

19:03.170 --> 19:06.314
Look at that.

19:07.418 --> 19:09.857
That's how you start a fire.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.966
That's why you carry a flint firestarter

19:11.996 --> 19:14.076
instead of a pair of stupid sunglasses,

19:14.106 --> 19:16.826
as your third and final item.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.348
Oh well, I-I
understand that your,

19:18.378 --> 19:22.316
your flint firestarter starts a campfire,

19:22.346 --> 19:25.285
but these sunglasses start a fire

19:25.315 --> 19:28.255
inside the hearts of young ladies.

19:28.285 --> 19:30.374
I won't deny that.

19:30.404 --> 19:31.604
I wish we had marshmallows...

19:34.238 --> 19:36.134
Whoa, what was that?

19:36.164 --> 19:37.369
What was what?

19:37.399 --> 19:39.115
Oh, do you have your flashlight?

19:39.145 --> 19:40.372
Uh, yeah...

19:40.402 --> 19:42.194
I've got mine, I got it.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.369
What'd you hear?

19:43.399 --> 19:44.515
It's, I mean it,

19:44.545 --> 19:46.795
it was definitely like a...

19:47.810 --> 19:52.271
Like a, I mean it was
kind of your stereotypical

19:52.301 --> 19:54.078
branch snap, but...

19:55.287 --> 19:57.196
Branches snap all the time.
- But I mean,

19:57.226 --> 19:59.136
I'm kinda freaked out 'cause I feel like,

19:59.166 --> 20:00.833
I mean, do you think those,

20:00.863 --> 20:02.500
those witch women followed us?

20:02.530 --> 20:03.726
'Cause they were acting really weird

20:03.756 --> 20:04.853
at the end of the interview.

20:04.883 --> 20:06.596
And they could...

20:06.626 --> 20:08.309
Okay, kind of.

20:08.339 --> 20:09.797
That's a fair point.

20:09.827 --> 20:11.027
Uh, but...

20:12.321 --> 20:14.789
It definitely is making
me a little uneasy.

20:14.819 --> 20:15.997
Uh...

20:16.027 --> 20:19.042
You know, for our, you know, first night.

20:19.072 --> 20:19.845
Well, don't worry about it.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.944
I mean, like, unless
you hear actual people,

20:21.974 --> 20:23.452
I wouldn't worry about it.

20:23.482 --> 20:24.694
It's a twig snapping.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.920
We need to concentrate on getting warm

20:25.950 --> 20:26.968
and just getting to sleep.

20:26.998 --> 20:29.142
We need to get some rest for tomorrow.

20:29.172 --> 20:31.576
We still have to find
a whole bunch of stuff.

20:31.606 --> 20:32.531
You're right.

20:32.561 --> 20:35.290
We got plenty of firewood to burn.

20:35.320 --> 20:38.274
So I guess it's time to call it a night,

20:38.304 --> 20:40.444
and let the fear go to bed with us.

20:40.474 --> 20:41.674
Exactly.

20:52.910 --> 20:54.821
Hey.

20:56.859 --> 20:59.334
There is something
outside of the camp.

20:59.364 --> 21:00.564
No.

21:01.098 --> 21:02.410
I'm serious.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.243
I don't know what it is,

21:03.273 --> 21:04.912
but there's something outside the camp.

21:04.942 --> 21:05.872
What are you talking about?

21:05.902 --> 21:07.867
Look, look.

21:11.969 --> 21:14.886
There's something outside the camp.

21:16.390 --> 21:17.807
It was loud, man.

21:18.900 --> 21:21.533
It was really, really loud.

21:21.563 --> 21:23.892
I mean, did it sound
like an animal or a person?

21:23.922 --> 21:25.192
I mean, I-I-I don't know,

21:25.222 --> 21:26.692
I guess an animal.

21:28.831 --> 21:31.248
I don't hear anything now.

21:34.676 --> 21:36.509
I don't hear anything.

21:40.825 --> 21:43.298
All right, well, let's go back to sleep.

21:43.328 --> 21:44.462
Go back to sleep.

21:44.492 --> 21:45.734
There's nothing out here.

21:45.764 --> 21:47.442
Put some more wood
on, and I'll go back to sleep.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.778
You just...

21:48.808 --> 21:50.666
Go ahead, all right?

22:37.491 --> 22:40.658
Ah, another beautiful October morning.

22:42.051 --> 22:44.080
Yeah.

22:44.110 --> 22:45.702
So how'd you like your, uh,

22:45.732 --> 22:48.182
your floor mattress
here, your dirt mattress?

22:48.212 --> 22:50.662
The most comfortable
bed I've ever slept on.

22:50.692 --> 22:52.000
The fire was really good though.

22:52.030 --> 22:53.324
It was good.

22:53.354 --> 22:54.619
Good job, man.

22:54.649 --> 22:58.150
So, first order of business,

22:58.180 --> 22:59.254
take care of water.

22:59.284 --> 23:00.481
Find some water.

23:00.511 --> 23:01.679
And uh, food.

23:01.709 --> 23:03.360
Food, definitely food.

23:03.390 --> 23:05.272
Did

23:05.302 --> 23:07.155
No.

23:07.185 --> 23:07.988
You sure?

23:08.018 --> 23:10.554
'Cause it, I didn't
leave it open all night.

23:10.584 --> 23:11.460
No, I didn't touch it.

23:11.490 --> 23:12.984
I mean, I had my backpack here.

23:13.014 --> 23:14.632
I was just sleeping on it.

23:14.662 --> 23:16.986
No, I didn't go near your back.

23:17.016 --> 23:19.340
I didn't need anything out of it.

23:19.370 --> 23:20.878
Do you think...

23:20.908 --> 23:24.356
Like a

23:24.386 --> 23:25.189
I don't know, I mean,

23:25.219 --> 23:26.505
don't you think one of them
would of them would have

23:26.535 --> 23:27.735
woken us up?

23:28.228 --> 23:29.428
I don't know, I...

23:29.458 --> 23:30.843
You su-sure like
in the middle of the night,

23:30.873 --> 23:32.968
you didn't like a, you didn't
decide to change the batteries

23:32.998 --> 23:34.227
in your camera or something?

23:34.257 --> 23:35.030
No.

23:35.060 --> 23:36.447
No, no, I mean unless I sleptwalk,

23:36.477 --> 23:39.353
and I'm not known for sleepwalking though.

23:39.383 --> 23:40.220
All right.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.693
One of the most important
tools you can have

23:42.723 --> 23:45.978
when venturing out into the
wilderness is a compass.

23:46.008 --> 23:49.263
But, just in the event that
you no longer have one,

23:49.293 --> 23:51.721
uh, there are a lot of
really important ways,

23:51.751 --> 23:53.681
you know, good ways to uh,

23:53.711 --> 23:55.654
to find your way out of the woods.

23:55.684 --> 23:59.077
As you know, the uh, the
sun, uh, rises in the east,

23:59.107 --> 24:00.309
sets in the west.

24:00.339 --> 24:03.695
Also, if it's a cloudy day like today,

24:03.725 --> 24:04.663
you can always find moss.

24:04.693 --> 24:07.345
You know, moss always grows
on the north side of the tree,

24:07.375 --> 24:09.295
so you can find that, you know,

24:09.325 --> 24:10.745
which direction is north.

24:10.775 --> 24:13.325
That's true, but it's also
important to keep in mind

24:13.355 --> 24:15.679
that uh, sometimes it's not always about

24:15.709 --> 24:17.029
getting yourself out.

24:17.059 --> 24:20.255
Sometimes you want to make
sure that people can find you

24:20.285 --> 24:21.345
when you're lost.
- True.

24:21.375 --> 24:24.674
So marking your trail
is extremely important.

24:24.704 --> 24:28.004
Either by cre-creating
some kind of an unnatural,

24:28.034 --> 24:30.289
uh, stone marking on the path,

24:30.319 --> 24:33.256
or something as simple as
tying a piece of ribbon,

24:33.286 --> 24:35.467
or you can even take out a, your knife,

24:35.497 --> 24:36.449
which if you don't have a knife,

24:36.479 --> 24:37.897
don't even bother watching this show,

24:37.927 --> 24:38.982
you're not gonna make it.

24:39.012 --> 24:41.995
But you take this knife and just

24:42.025 --> 24:44.437
make an unnatural mark in the tree.

24:44.467 --> 24:46.850
You're not gonna harm the tree,

24:46.880 --> 24:49.778
and it's gonna let people know
that you were through here.

24:49.808 --> 24:51.100
No animal is gonna make that marking.

24:51.130 --> 24:53.199
They're gonna know
people are along the way.

24:53.229 --> 24:54.832
And you don't have to cut every tree.

24:54.862 --> 24:57.843
Just cut maybe every five
or six trees along the path

24:57.873 --> 25:00.854
at the same height to make
sure people can find you,

25:00.884 --> 25:02.269
and you can get to safety.

25:02.299 --> 25:04.923
It's extremely important to
make sure people can figure out

25:04.953 --> 25:05.920
where you've been going,

25:05.950 --> 25:07.562
because in a situation like this,

25:07.592 --> 25:09.133
if you're moving a lot,

25:09.163 --> 25:10.805
they're not gonna be able to find you.

25:10.835 --> 25:15.064
But sometimes you have to
move, much like in our case,

25:15.094 --> 25:18.312
because we have no food and no water.

25:18.342 --> 25:19.328
And uh...
- But we will soon.

25:19.358 --> 25:20.339
We will soon.

25:20.369 --> 25:21.391
I don't know about you, but uh...

25:21.421 --> 25:24.252
I have a really good
feeling we're close to water.

25:24.282 --> 25:27.084
I think we'll come across
it within the next hour.

25:27.114 --> 25:31.458
My muscles are starting to
cramp a little bit because,

25:31.488 --> 25:33.926
well, we don't have any water.

25:33.956 --> 25:35.156
Uh...

25:35.706 --> 25:36.970
- That's a...
- Something to keep in mind.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.901
Dehydration can sneak up on you.

25:38.931 --> 25:40.832
You don't even see it coming.

25:40.862 --> 25:42.062
So...

25:42.545 --> 25:44.558
Once you have discovered water,

25:44.588 --> 25:46.571
a good running water source,

25:46.601 --> 25:50.070
you want to make sure that
it's actually safe to drink.

25:50.100 --> 25:53.539
You don't want to drink it
straight from the source,

25:53.569 --> 25:56.495
uh, simply because there could
be a whole bunch of bacteria

25:56.525 --> 25:57.609
in the water.

25:57.639 --> 26:00.253
You know, some people
say, "Oh it's, you know,

26:00.283 --> 26:01.917
"if it comes from the top of a mountain,

26:01.947 --> 26:03.305
"you know, it's perfectly safe."

26:03.335 --> 26:05.177
No, don't try to, don't even trust that.

26:05.207 --> 26:07.297
You probably know this
is you watch the show,

26:07.327 --> 26:08.951
but Dallas hiked the PCT once.

26:08.981 --> 26:09.754
I did.

26:09.784 --> 26:11.937
And the majority of
people who failed to do

26:11.967 --> 26:16.134
the 2,600 mile hike up the
Pacific Coast Trail, they uh,

26:17.205 --> 26:20.155
they quit very early on from
drinking unpurified water.

26:20.185 --> 26:20.958
Yeah.

26:20.988 --> 26:23.625
But with us, we have, uh, iodine tablets.

26:23.655 --> 26:25.107
We're gonna find iodine, uh,

26:25.137 --> 26:26.559
put iodine tablets in the water

26:26.589 --> 26:29.879
as soon as we, uh, find a good source.

26:29.909 --> 26:33.009
Uh, you can also use a SteriPEN.

26:33.039 --> 26:35.845
Uh, that's actually a
good, preferred method.

26:35.875 --> 26:38.652
Uh, if you don't have any of those things,

26:38.682 --> 26:41.911
uh, get a good fire going,
and just boil the water.

26:41.941 --> 26:45.501
But please, do not drink,
uh, untreated water.

26:45.531 --> 26:46.812
It's-it's not that safe.

26:46.842 --> 26:48.447
Whew, let's-let's hold up for a second.

26:48.477 --> 26:49.250
Okay.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.955
So let's talk about food real quick,

26:50.985 --> 26:53.873
'cause uh, I feel like,
uh, it's on my mind

26:53.903 --> 26:55.581
and it's on your mind.

26:55.611 --> 26:57.863
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna be uh,

26:57.893 --> 26:58.961
using my slingshot.

26:58.991 --> 27:01.632
Hopefully, uh, something will come along.

27:01.662 --> 27:04.035
Best thing is just to stay still,

27:04.065 --> 27:05.825
let the animals come to you.

27:05.855 --> 27:08.277
Uh, maybe we'll see a squirrel or, uh,

27:08.307 --> 27:10.729
if we're lucky, something even bigger.

27:10.759 --> 27:11.532
But...

27:11.562 --> 27:12.737
The slingshot takes
a lot of skill though.

27:12.767 --> 27:13.913
And it should be mentioned...
- It does.

27:13.943 --> 27:16.220
You know, I gave you a-a
hard time about choosing

27:16.250 --> 27:18.008
a slingshot as one of your personal items,

27:18.038 --> 27:21.096
and it is because the
success rate is very low.

27:21.126 --> 27:22.116
And one of the...
- Maybe.

27:22.146 --> 27:25.194
Biggest tools you need
out here is patience.

27:25.224 --> 27:28.242
- That's true.
- If you don't have patience,

27:28.272 --> 27:30.542
you're not gonna get dinner,
you're gonna be hungry.

27:30.572 --> 27:31.345
Yep.

27:31.375 --> 27:33.717
Uh, the other biggest tool in the woods

27:33.747 --> 27:35.323
is definitely Dallas.

27:35.353 --> 27:36.793
He would be the other big tool.

27:36.823 --> 27:37.946
So uh...
- Thanks, man.

27:37.976 --> 27:38.809
- Hey, you know...
- I appreciate it.

27:38.839 --> 27:39.946
I got you, brother.

27:39.976 --> 27:43.866
So we're going to uh, pick
a good spot and stay there

27:43.896 --> 27:45.776
until the animals in the area hopefully

27:45.806 --> 27:47.722
get used to our scent.

27:47.752 --> 27:50.282
I smell rugged and-and manly.

27:50.312 --> 27:51.688
Which I guess they're threatened by.

27:51.718 --> 27:52.990
A lot of people seemed
to be threatened by it.

27:53.020 --> 27:54.592
No he doesn't, he smells like BO.

27:54.622 --> 27:56.194
I need you stay a little quieter.

27:56.224 --> 27:57.434
You got it.

28:18.896 --> 28:20.096
Missed.

28:20.900 --> 28:24.004
Like I said, it takes a while.

28:24.034 --> 28:27.568
Well, we only have
enough battery for 21 days, so...

28:27.598 --> 28:30.985
Funny.

28:34.333 --> 28:35.828
How did you miss that?

28:35.858 --> 28:37.788
I don't know.

28:37.818 --> 28:39.401
It was right there.

28:51.605 --> 28:52.805
Damn it.

28:54.182 --> 28:55.382
I got nothin'.

28:56.796 --> 28:58.364
Wait.

28:58.394 --> 28:59.594
Hold on one second.

29:03.689 --> 29:05.031
Come on!

29:06.583 --> 29:07.783
What'd you hear?

29:07.813 --> 29:09.765
Trust me, it'll be a lot
better than your hunting.

29:09.795 --> 29:11.221
That's what it's gonna be.

29:11.251 --> 29:12.647
Oh, screw you, come on.

29:12.677 --> 29:14.155
Let's see you kill it having,

29:14.185 --> 29:17.653
at least I brought a-a
instrument for-for hunting.

29:17.683 --> 29:20.699
You know, do you plan to kill
anything with your sunglasses?

29:20.729 --> 29:23.923
Well, maybe if you don't
shut up and follow me.

29:23.953 --> 29:25.685
Well, your sunglasses are killing me.

29:25.715 --> 29:27.769
The ugliest things I've
ever seen in my life.

29:27.799 --> 29:29.769
Oh, haters gonna hate.

29:30.771 --> 29:32.533
Haters gonna hate.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.766
Come on dude, trust me, you're gonna,

29:34.796 --> 29:36.999
you're gonna be very happy about this.

29:51.715 --> 29:53.325
Oh yeah.

29:53.355 --> 29:54.701
Oh yeah, buddy.

29:54.731 --> 29:56.953
I don't really think
you heard anything, buddy.

29:56.983 --> 29:58.183
Oh, I did.

29:58.650 --> 29:59.850
- So you did.
- See that's the thing,

29:59.880 --> 30:03.936
you keep forgetting, I
hiked the Appalachian Trail,

30:03.966 --> 30:05.166
Eagle Scout...

30:07.250 --> 30:11.417
I know a couple things about
one very important thing.

30:12.529 --> 30:14.696
And that is finding water.

30:19.601 --> 30:21.101
Here it is, buddy.

30:22.017 --> 30:24.262
Congratulations.

30:24.292 --> 30:25.614
Do I owe you an apology?
- Yeah.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.588
Uh, well you're the one
who gets to drop down there

30:29.618 --> 30:31.971
and fill the canteen
and we'll call it even.

30:33.389 --> 30:35.613
But now that we have water,

30:35.643 --> 30:37.838
we can set up a proper camp.

30:37.868 --> 30:40.349
- That's true.
- And maybe, just maybe,

30:40.379 --> 30:42.861
we'll be a little bit comfortable tonight.

30:42.891 --> 30:43.664
Hopefully.

30:43.694 --> 30:46.934
The weather has been
turning even more frigid.

30:46.964 --> 30:48.488
It is very, very cold.

30:48.518 --> 30:49.780
- But...
- I'm hoping we can get

30:49.810 --> 30:51.272
at least a fire started.

30:51.302 --> 30:52.973
Oh, I think we won't
have a problem with that.

30:53.003 --> 30:53.776
No.

30:53.806 --> 30:55.112
Not with a stomach full of water.

30:55.142 --> 30:56.357
I'll take it.
- Yeah.

30:56.387 --> 30:57.924
I'll take it.

30:57.954 --> 30:59.492
So uh, so uh...

30:59.522 --> 31:00.866
How...

31:00.896 --> 31:04.160
Uh, how stupid are my sunglasses now, huh?

31:04.190 --> 31:05.496
They're incredibly stupid.

31:05.526 --> 31:09.177
They are the ugliest sunglasses
I have ever seen, I'm sorry.

31:09.207 --> 31:11.125
What do they say on the side?

31:11.155 --> 31:12.355
It's a band I like.

31:14.626 --> 31:19.046
So uh, one part of survival
that people don't like to uh,

31:19.076 --> 31:21.238
talk about so much is the fact that

31:21.268 --> 31:23.226
sometimes you need to conserve body heat.

31:23.256 --> 31:25.428
It has been consistently getting
colder in the Pine Barrens

31:25.458 --> 31:28.562
every night, and the fire
is not quite enough anymore.

31:28.592 --> 31:31.562
So uh, so I guess we're gonna spoon.

31:34.449 --> 31:36.644
Come here, it's okay.

31:36.674 --> 31:37.487
You're only the little spoon

31:37.517 --> 31:39.000
because I'm 30 pounds heavier than you.

31:39.030 --> 31:39.833
- No, no.
- So come on.

31:39.863 --> 31:40.636
Come on.

31:40.666 --> 31:41.589
All right, there we go.
- All right, all right.

31:41.619 --> 31:43.249
- Come here.
- Okay.

31:43.279 --> 31:44.082
It doesn't have to be weird

31:44.112 --> 31:44.930
if we don't make it weird, right?

31:44.960 --> 31:45.778
- Okay, all right.
- All right.

31:45.808 --> 31:47.008
Yep.

31:47.644 --> 31:49.119
- A little warmer, yeah.
- Yeah, all right.

31:49.149 --> 31:51.018
That's fine.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.008
Did you ever just...

31:58.038 --> 31:59.953
Look at the stars, and wonder?

31:59.983 --> 32:01.898
Okay, please, shut up now.

32:01.928 --> 32:03.398
Let's go to sleep.

32:04.811 --> 32:06.410
Do you think we all
have a guardian angel?

32:06.440 --> 32:07.213
Don't care.

32:07.243 --> 32:09.243
Just let me go to sleep.

32:11.435 --> 32:12.635
Every person has a soul mate.

32:12.665 --> 32:16.635
Okay, please...

32:18.030 --> 32:20.148
Now we can, we can sleep for real.

33:03.724 --> 33:05.506
Jesus fucking Christ!

33:05.536 --> 33:06.736
Jesus Christ!

33:07.501 --> 33:08.701
Okay, Dallas, Dallas, Dallas!

33:08.731 --> 33:12.360
I-I 100% saw an animal
out there, or something.

33:12.390 --> 33:15.020
I saw some shiny, beady red eyes.

33:15.050 --> 33:17.272
You know what I'm talking about, like a,

33:17.302 --> 33:19.525
like, what if it was a bear or something?

33:20.278 --> 33:21.478
I don't know if it was a bear!

33:21.508 --> 33:22.604
But what, could it have been?

33:22.634 --> 33:23.407
I mean, the-the-the...

33:23.437 --> 33:27.020
- I don't know.
- It could have been a bear.

33:28.524 --> 33:30.195
Did you see it exactly or...

33:30.225 --> 33:31.867
Yeah, no, I saw the eyes of it.

33:31.897 --> 33:34.019
They-they must have gleamed
off of my flashlight,

33:34.049 --> 33:35.843
or something.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.863
Let's take a look around.

33:39.893 --> 33:42.036
You sure you saw something?

33:42.066 --> 33:43.869
I'm positive.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.507
I just don't want
anything to mess with our,

33:47.537 --> 33:48.310
through the, through there,

33:48.340 --> 33:50.564
I don't want anything to
mess with our campsite.

33:53.905 --> 33:56.322
I don't hear anything, man.

33:57.287 --> 33:59.977
Look, if you're so worried about it, just,

34:00.007 --> 34:00.780
all right, here's what we'll do.

34:00.810 --> 34:03.773
We'll put up the deer camera,
it'll detect any movement.

34:21.103 --> 34:22.889
Well, that was a night.

34:22.918 --> 34:24.706
That was a night.

34:27.763 --> 34:29.871
But uh...

34:29.900 --> 34:31.101
Hey.

34:35.083 --> 34:36.284
That's uh...

34:37.567 --> 34:39.317
Looks a little weird.

34:42.230 --> 34:43.429
What is that?

34:43.460 --> 34:44.476
I don't know.

34:44.507 --> 34:46.476
What do you, what do you think it is?

34:46.505 --> 34:48.326
It...
- I don't know.

34:48.356 --> 34:50.456
It's just hanging off the tree.

34:52.467 --> 34:54.983
Well I mean it's, it's creepy.

34:55.013 --> 34:57.528
Like, why would it be here?

34:59.452 --> 35:00.867
Why would there be kids playing

35:00.897 --> 35:02.313
in the deepest part of the trail?

35:04.992 --> 35:06.300
I don't know,
what should I do with it?

35:06.330 --> 35:07.998
Like...
- Throw it away.

35:08.028 --> 35:09.667
Or keep it, who cares?

35:09.697 --> 35:10.838
I'm gonna, I'm gonna toss it.

35:10.868 --> 35:12.763
You can do whatever you
want with it, I don't care.

35:12.793 --> 35:13.871
It freaks me out a little bit.

35:13.901 --> 35:15.119
I don't want it.

35:18.055 --> 35:19.821
All right, uh...

35:19.851 --> 35:21.879
Let's keep, let's keep the pace, right?

35:21.909 --> 35:23.109
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:26.959 --> 35:30.405
Hey uh, remember when we were
in the Scottish Highlands?

35:30.435 --> 35:32.752
And your pants got, got
so full of thistles,

35:32.782 --> 35:35.100
you had to walk around
half naked for two days?

35:35.130 --> 35:36.255
Okay, you need to stop talking.

35:36.285 --> 35:38.265
Please stop talking.

35:38.295 --> 35:40.963
Why do you have to make
everything into a joke?

35:40.993 --> 35:42.483
We're in a bit of a situation.

35:42.513 --> 35:44.413
We have to find food right now.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.313
Your joking is not helping, okay?

35:46.343 --> 35:48.007
Well, your slingshot didn't
help either, but I didn't

35:48.037 --> 35:49.529
scream at you over it.
- Yes it does.

35:49.559 --> 35:50.524
Yes it does.

35:50.554 --> 35:53.485
I have hunted, I've, I
have killed a lot of things

35:53.515 --> 35:55.236
with that slingshot, okay?

35:55.266 --> 35:58.697
Tell that to my growling stomach.

35:59.898 --> 36:01.098
I'm sick of your attitude.

36:01.128 --> 36:02.555
You, you're an internet celebrity.

36:02.585 --> 36:04.013
I know a little bit more about this

36:04.043 --> 36:04.933
than you do, okay?
- Oh.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.303
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:06.333 --> 36:07.644
Yeah, I don't have the hunting

36:07.674 --> 36:10.069
and survival experience necessary, right?

36:10.099 --> 36:10.872
Right, yeah.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.725
Well, let's-let's-let's figure that out.

36:12.755 --> 36:14.579
Let's do a wager that matters out here.

36:14.609 --> 36:15.763
I'll tell you what.

36:15.793 --> 36:17.069
How about this?

36:17.099 --> 36:18.345
We'll split up.

36:18.375 --> 36:21.887
First one to find food doesn't
have to dig the latrine.

36:21.917 --> 36:23.233
Deal.

36:23.263 --> 36:24.458
All right.

36:24.488 --> 36:25.653
Good luck.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.488
See you at sundown.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.718
Asshole.

36:32.419 --> 36:36.169
So, I just want to say
I have a secret weapon

36:37.865 --> 36:40.449
that Dallas doesn't know about.

36:40.479 --> 36:44.857
And I'm going to get,
uh, something good to eat

36:44.887 --> 36:47.274
pretty easily, with any luck.

36:48.664 --> 36:51.513
Luck is a big part of surviving out here.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.763
So uh, what we've got here,

36:55.296 --> 36:57.005
is a nice,

36:57.035 --> 36:58.291
a nice creek.

36:58.321 --> 36:59.578
And uh...

37:00.901 --> 37:02.101
I think I know what I need to do

37:02.131 --> 37:03.759
to get some food out of it.

37:03.789 --> 37:06.077
Certain kinds of fish like
to hide in the shallows,

37:06.107 --> 37:09.091
kind of where there, there are shadows.

37:09.121 --> 37:13.516
And uh, if you sit long enough,
if you're quiet long enough,

37:13.546 --> 37:15.906
you can actually catch one
using your hands as bait.

37:15.936 --> 37:17.784
It's called noodling,

37:17.814 --> 37:21.319
uh, which is illegal in some areas,

37:21.349 --> 37:23.260
uh, because it can be a little dangerous.

37:23.290 --> 37:27.174
But when you're in a
life or death situation,

37:27.204 --> 37:31.208
you just dip your hands in the
freezing cold water and hope.

37:31.238 --> 37:32.438
So...

37:34.900 --> 37:36.483
It is way too cold.

37:49.252 --> 37:51.823
One of the secrets to noodling,

37:51.853 --> 37:54.424
other than being very quiet is uh,

37:54.454 --> 37:56.110
you have to wait it out.

37:56.140 --> 38:00.307
And this water is making it
extremely difficult to do that.

38:18.676 --> 38:20.853
I hope the camera caught that sound.

38:20.883 --> 38:23.060
I don't know what it was but uh,

38:23.090 --> 38:25.318
I intend to find out.

38:25.348 --> 38:28.515
I will show him that you can in fact

38:29.543 --> 38:33.210
make the slingshot into
a formidable weapon.

38:37.672 --> 38:39.973
It is really, really cold out here.

38:40.003 --> 38:42.306
My fingers are frozen solid.

38:43.260 --> 38:45.940
So, I think it may be affecting my ability

38:45.970 --> 38:47.690
to do this very well.

38:51.972 --> 38:55.116
Whatever he's doing, I can assure you,

38:55.146 --> 38:58.138
it is not as effective as this.

38:58.168 --> 39:00.625
He will most definitely fail.

39:00.655 --> 39:03.113
I'm gonna get that squirrel.

39:09.353 --> 39:11.353
Still nothing...
- Dallas!

39:18.530 --> 39:21.113
You've gotta see this!

39:22.821 --> 39:24.021
All right.

39:25.110 --> 39:27.860
This looks ominous, a little bit.

39:30.830 --> 39:35.000
Kind of your stereotypical
abandoned campsite.

39:35.030 --> 39:38.500
But uh...

39:42.894 --> 39:44.977
Oh, what do we have here?

39:46.856 --> 39:48.056
Oh, thank you!

39:48.636 --> 39:49.836
What'd you find?

39:49.866 --> 39:50.788
Oh man.

39:50.818 --> 39:52.034
- Oh man.
- Not a whole lot,

39:52.064 --> 39:53.692
to be honest.

39:53.722 --> 39:55.320
Uh, looks like...

39:55.350 --> 39:59.176
Somebody didn't uh, end
up staying very long.

39:59.206 --> 40:00.498
They don't have a...

40:00.528 --> 40:03.478
Yeah, no tent, no
fire, but they gathered wood.

40:03.508 --> 40:05.728
They clearly ate a couple meals.

40:07.725 --> 40:11.392
Uh, look at
the food in these pots.

40:12.356 --> 40:14.392
I don't like this.

40:14.422 --> 40:15.673
Uh, this worries me a little bit.

40:15.703 --> 40:16.924
Maybe somebody got sick of it.

40:16.954 --> 40:18.002
I mean, I'm pretty sick of it already.

40:18.032 --> 40:20.808
Well I don't know why they'd
leave this stuff here though.

40:20.838 --> 40:22.331
I mean, that's perfectly good stuff,

40:22.361 --> 40:23.824
that's perfectly good equipment.

40:23.854 --> 40:25.872
I don't know why they'd
just leave that here.

40:25.902 --> 40:27.921
I don't know, but
I do have some good news.

40:27.951 --> 40:29.728
Look what I found.

40:29.758 --> 40:31.312
Spam, nice.

40:31.342 --> 40:33.524
You know what this means?

40:33.554 --> 40:35.107
I found food first.

40:36.397 --> 40:38.050
I mean, unless you got a
squirrel in your backpack.

40:38.080 --> 40:39.016
No, you didn't.

40:39.046 --> 40:40.376
- Yeah I did, I'm afraid...
- You did not find food.

40:40.406 --> 40:41.489
This is food.

40:41.519 --> 40:43.211
That is food, we will eat it.

40:43.241 --> 40:44.752
I will not give you
credit for finding food.

40:44.782 --> 40:46.294
You found it in that backpack, didn't you?

40:46.324 --> 40:47.928
Well, if you're not hungry,

40:47.958 --> 40:51.163
then I guess I didn't find food.

40:51.193 --> 40:54.063
All right, there's yours portioned out.

40:54.093 --> 40:55.563
Multiple portions.

40:56.906 --> 40:58.106
Look at that.

40:58.136 --> 40:59.661
Oh!
- This still does not count

40:59.691 --> 41:01.187
as you finding food, I'm sorry.

41:01.217 --> 41:03.946
This is pure protein,
exactly what you need

41:03.976 --> 41:05.226
to survive in the wilderness.

41:05.256 --> 41:06.029
No.

41:06.059 --> 41:07.261
Look, listen to me,
I'm not trying to bitch

41:07.291 --> 41:08.657
about having to dig the latrine,

41:08.687 --> 41:11.013
I'm just saying that you
coming across this food

41:11.043 --> 41:15.736
is not the same as me going
out with, you know, with a,

41:15.766 --> 41:17.036
a slingshot.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.251
Just try it, don't be a baby.

41:24.281 --> 41:25.356
You're such an elitist.

41:25.386 --> 41:26.462
Eat the food of the people.

41:26.492 --> 41:28.129
It's Spam, enjoy it.

41:29.062 --> 41:30.262
Man.

41:33.292 --> 41:34.492
See?

41:34.522 --> 41:36.042
It's not that bad, is it?

41:36.072 --> 41:37.924
I'd rather have the lichen on the floor.

41:40.880 --> 41:42.297
Where's my light?

41:43.245 --> 41:45.065
Did you see that?

41:45.095 --> 41:46.916
I saw something.

42:01.358 --> 42:03.108
Maybe we should uh...

42:04.412 --> 42:05.612
Try to make the fire bigger.

42:05.642 --> 42:06.842
I think uh...

42:09.432 --> 42:11.296
I don't know, but I-I-I noticed earlier,

42:11.326 --> 42:13.160
the clouds were getting a bit rough,

42:13.190 --> 42:14.788
and I'm afraid in the morning,
the fire's gonna be out

42:14.818 --> 42:18.038
and we won't be able to start it again.

42:28.322 --> 42:29.522
Dallas?

42:32.780 --> 42:33.980
Dallas?

42:41.656 --> 42:43.489
Dallas, where are you?

42:55.168 --> 42:56.977
Fuck, maybe it's...

42:57.007 --> 42:58.817
Maybe it's coyotes.

43:13.017 --> 43:14.217
Jesus!

43:24.627 --> 43:26.369
Jesus Christ, where were you?

43:26.399 --> 43:28.145
Where the fuck were you?

43:28.175 --> 43:29.257
I went to the bathroom, man.

43:29.287 --> 43:30.744
I was right over there.

43:30.774 --> 43:32.202
Were you looking for me?

43:32.232 --> 43:33.698
I yelled your
name, and you didn't,

43:33.728 --> 43:35.195
you didn't call out or anything!

43:35.225 --> 43:37.832
I didn't hear anything.

43:37.862 --> 43:39.062
You all right?

43:40.310 --> 43:41.510
Something happen?

43:41.540 --> 43:42.740
What happened?

43:43.648 --> 43:47.340
I don't know what it was, man...

43:48.612 --> 43:51.442
What are you talking about?

43:51.472 --> 43:54.138
I thought maybe
there were coyotes.

43:55.310 --> 43:56.720
- So I...
- I don't think so.

43:56.750 --> 43:58.560
I mean...
- I tried...

43:58.590 --> 44:01.590
I tried hollering to get them to go.

44:03.772 --> 44:04.972
Nevermind.

44:05.002 --> 44:08.309
- I don't hear anything.
- Nevermind.

44:08.339 --> 44:11.646
Just go back to, go back to sleep.

44:11.676 --> 44:13.064
Good morning to be alive.

44:13.094 --> 44:14.909
Okay, here we go.

44:14.939 --> 44:16.139
Uh, so...

44:17.092 --> 44:18.569
Um...

44:18.599 --> 44:22.449
So the uh, the sleet and wintery
mix we've been experiencing

44:22.479 --> 44:25.149
on and off seemed to come,

44:25.179 --> 44:27.264
it felt like every 20
minutes to 25 minutes

44:27.294 --> 44:28.586
while we were sleeping.

44:28.616 --> 44:31.437
Uh, it kept everything
nice and uh, and moist,

44:31.467 --> 44:33.343
very hard to burn.

44:33.373 --> 44:37.092
So uh, our flint firestarter
was pretty much useless,

44:37.122 --> 44:38.976
so we had a nice...

44:39.006 --> 44:40.642
A nice night with no fire.

44:40.672 --> 44:41.872
And uh...

44:42.566 --> 44:43.800
That was great.

44:43.830 --> 44:45.268
Uh...

44:45.298 --> 44:49.312
I don't want to talk about it.

44:49.342 --> 44:51.229
Leave me alone, please.

44:53.368 --> 44:57.035
Folks, if you ever
wondered why after, uh,

44:58.065 --> 45:00.097
about six episodes of
season one, all of a sudden,

45:00.127 --> 45:02.407
I showed up on the program,

45:02.437 --> 45:06.220
it might be because I'm willing
to talk about my problems.

45:06.250 --> 45:07.243
It raises a fair point,

45:07.273 --> 45:11.440
which is about your psychological
condition in the wild.

45:16.893 --> 45:18.093
Seriously?

45:19.258 --> 45:22.726
This is what you're gonna do right now?

45:22.756 --> 45:24.641
You know, you're being a diva
right now and I'm being...

45:24.671 --> 45:25.896
- I'm not being a diva.
- I'm trying...

45:25.926 --> 45:27.641
You're being a
fucking asshole right now.

45:27.671 --> 45:29.386
I'm trying not to
get angry at you right now.

45:29.416 --> 45:30.189
I tried telling you...

45:30.219 --> 45:31.192
I didn't sleep at all last night.

45:31.222 --> 45:32.942
Leave me alone, okay?

45:36.795 --> 45:37.995
All right?

45:38.025 --> 45:40.035
Listen, I know you're
pissed at me right now,

45:40.065 --> 45:41.712
I know you're pissed at me right now,

45:41.742 --> 45:43.360
but when they look at the footage,

45:43.390 --> 45:45.766
when the editor looks at the
footage and we did our job,

45:45.796 --> 45:46.940
even though we-we were suffering,

45:46.970 --> 45:48.534
you're gonna be very happy.

45:48.564 --> 45:50.129
Okay, so I'm-I'm sorry.

45:53.707 --> 45:56.173
What is this?

45:56.203 --> 45:58.639
I don't know.

45:58.669 --> 45:59.799
Did you put it in my bag?

45:59.829 --> 46:00.929
It wasn't here last night.

46:00.959 --> 46:02.232
What, did you put it in my bag?

46:02.262 --> 46:03.941
Why would I put that in your bag?

46:03.971 --> 46:05.621
Because
there's no one else here!

46:05.651 --> 46:07.963
Oh, so I'm crazy that
our bags were moved,

46:07.993 --> 46:10.023
maybe by wild animals, or you,

46:10.053 --> 46:11.847
while you got up to take a leak,

46:11.877 --> 46:13.672
but there's something in your bag

46:13.702 --> 46:15.276
and now you're so mad at me,

46:15.306 --> 46:16.850
maybe you need a timeout.

46:16.880 --> 46:19.011
Maybe you should go take
a walk for just a minute.

46:19.041 --> 46:20.872
No, 'cause you're acting
like a child, okay?

46:20.902 --> 46:25.181
Who else would
have put it in my bag?

46:25.211 --> 46:26.393
It had to be you.
- Look at...

46:26.423 --> 46:27.416
Are you trying to fuck with me?

46:27.446 --> 46:28.439
- Look at...
- I'm trying to make

46:28.469 --> 46:29.374
a fuckin' TV show, okay?

46:29.404 --> 46:30.641
Look at your bag.

46:30.671 --> 46:31.879
It's full of garbage.

46:31.909 --> 46:33.651
Maybe if you threw something
away every now and then,

46:33.681 --> 46:35.078
you'd know what was in it!

46:35.108 --> 46:36.308
I'm...

46:41.896 --> 46:45.342
Hey uh, I'm sorry I yelled at you.

46:45.372 --> 46:47.350
I didn't mean it, okay?

46:47.380 --> 46:49.359
Whatever, it's fine.

46:50.930 --> 46:53.014
You know, one thing I feel
like I probably bring up

46:53.044 --> 46:55.431
too often on this show is uh,

46:56.668 --> 46:59.656
the extra weight of all
the camera equipment

46:59.686 --> 47:01.079
and batteries we're carrying.

47:01.109 --> 47:02.472
It's about 40 pounds per pack,

47:02.502 --> 47:04.883
'cause we don't have survival
equipment in these packs.

47:04.913 --> 47:06.431
It's all us.

47:06.461 --> 47:07.950
All the time.

47:07.980 --> 47:09.548
But I guess that is the
reality of the situation.

47:09.578 --> 47:11.885
It doesn't take you out of it maybe.

47:11.915 --> 47:13.115
Uh...

47:13.624 --> 47:16.066
You're gonna get dizzy if
you keep doing that, man.

47:16.096 --> 47:18.267
Dude, this thing's not pointing north.

47:18.297 --> 47:19.463
Well, did you calibrate it or...

47:19.493 --> 47:21.240
Yeah, I calibrated it.

47:21.270 --> 47:22.228
It's just the only thing you...

47:22.258 --> 47:24.154
It's spinning around
in circles right now.

47:24.184 --> 47:26.308
It's not pointing north.

47:26.338 --> 47:28.251
Dude, what the fuck did
you do to this compass?

47:28.281 --> 47:29.590
I didn't touch the compass.

47:30.707 --> 47:31.907
I didn't touch it.

47:31.937 --> 47:32.848
What did you do?

47:32.878 --> 47:35.334
What would I, why would
I mess with your compass?

47:35.364 --> 47:36.244
Because!

47:36.274 --> 47:37.124
Where

47:37.154 --> 47:38.572
Did you have another compass?

47:39.557 --> 47:40.920
Yeah, the
one from the campsite.

47:40.950 --> 47:43.550
I don't know, I-I didn't
take it 'cause it's like a...

47:44.838 --> 47:46.594
'Cause it's a crappy
like, fourth grader compass.

47:46.624 --> 47:48.263
You have a military spec compass.

47:48.293 --> 47:49.763
You have to take advantage
of every situation.

47:49.793 --> 47:51.474
Why wouldn't you take the compass?

47:51.504 --> 47:53.403
Because I thought we had the
best compass we could have.

47:53.433 --> 47:54.206
I-I-I...

47:54.236 --> 47:55.836
What did you do to this thing?

47:56.914 --> 47:58.381
Why would I break the compass?

47:58.411 --> 48:00.357
You probably fucked it up somehow.

48:00.387 --> 48:01.685
You didn't know what
you were doing with it.

48:01.715 --> 48:02.525
You messed it up.

48:02.555 --> 48:04.482
Yeah, I-I can't use a compass.

48:05.948 --> 48:07.290
This is not pointing north, see?

48:07.320 --> 48:09.290
It's not pointing north.

48:10.758 --> 48:12.008
Jesus Christ...

48:16.498 --> 48:17.698
I didn't.

48:24.104 --> 48:25.304
Hey uh...

48:26.129 --> 48:27.712
A little cold, huh?

48:34.997 --> 48:36.197
The packs are gettin' a little heavy.

48:36.227 --> 48:40.196
You think uh, maybe we could
take uh, a little break?

48:40.226 --> 48:41.517
Tiny...

48:41.547 --> 48:42.380
Tiny step?
- No, we have to,

48:42.410 --> 48:44.143
we have to keep going.

48:44.173 --> 48:45.876
Maybe just a minute?

48:45.906 --> 48:48.274
No, we have to, we have to
get a far enough distance away

48:48.304 --> 48:49.454
from our previous campsite.

48:49.484 --> 48:52.656
And I'm stopping, just for a minute.

48:52.686 --> 48:54.156
Just for a minute.

48:57.270 --> 48:58.470
What is that?

48:59.423 --> 49:00.623
I don't know.

49:00.653 --> 49:02.152
- No that's...
- A marker.

49:02.182 --> 49:04.569
That's, that's uh...

49:05.794 --> 49:07.338
On purpose.

49:07.368 --> 49:08.171
Yeah, it's on purpose.

49:08.201 --> 49:09.819
Some kids probably made it.

49:09.849 --> 49:12.011
Might be uh, to mark their path,

49:12.041 --> 49:14.204
make sure they don't get lost.

49:14.234 --> 49:16.658
Uh, well I mean...

49:16.688 --> 49:19.640
But it's a triangle,
so it has three points.

49:19.670 --> 49:20.896
When you're marking your path,

49:20.926 --> 49:24.145
you want to have a direction that goes,

49:24.175 --> 49:25.978
that goes with it, but
it has three directions,

49:26.008 --> 49:28.701
because it has three points,
so it's a very poor marker.

49:28.731 --> 49:30.495
I mean, it's a good marker...
- Well not...

49:30.525 --> 49:32.290
Being that the geometry
is not in-in nature.

49:32.320 --> 49:33.507
It's nothing, it's a marker.

49:33.537 --> 49:34.569
Some kids probably were in here,

49:34.599 --> 49:35.799
they wanted to mark their path.

49:36.465 --> 49:38.046
Kids hiked...

49:38.076 --> 49:40.994
11 miles, 15 miles, however far we are?

49:41.024 --> 49:43.942
I
don't have an explanation, okay?

49:43.972 --> 49:45.172
I mean...

49:46.622 --> 49:48.373
Hey look, good news.

49:48.403 --> 49:50.653
The sleet came back, right?

49:52.175 --> 49:54.078
All right...
- I guess we're lucky.

49:56.262 --> 49:58.118
Yeah.

49:58.148 --> 50:01.716
You know, so this is
pretty bad, I won't lie.

50:01.746 --> 50:02.946
But uh...

50:04.968 --> 50:09.135
Do you remember when we were
in the Appalachians and uh,

50:10.811 --> 50:13.144
there was that mountain cat.

50:14.326 --> 50:16.659
Uh, we were so afraid of it.

50:20.358 --> 50:22.686
You threw, you threw a porcupine at it!

50:22.716 --> 50:26.019
Mmhmm.

50:28.317 --> 50:31.567
Oh, you can't buy memories like that.

50:33.655 --> 50:36.330
You know, another thing uh,

50:36.360 --> 50:38.998
when you think about cultural differences.

50:39.028 --> 50:43.111
You know, the Bedouin
tribe has this very strange

50:44.554 --> 50:46.721
kind of ritual where they,

50:48.024 --> 50:51.247
the men cover themselves in
camel urine, I believe it was.

50:51.277 --> 50:54.500
That was one of the weirdest
things I had ever learned on a

50:54.530 --> 50:55.728
Road to Nowhere shoot.

50:55.758 --> 50:58.038
They covered themselves in camel urine

50:58.068 --> 51:00.772
to be more attractive to perspective mates

51:00.802 --> 51:03.506
in order to initiate marital intercourse.

51:03.536 --> 51:04.736
And uh...

51:05.770 --> 51:08.458
Kind of wish I had gotten you
camel urine for Christmas so,

51:08.488 --> 51:11.176
'cause then maybe Dallas could
have some marital intercourse

51:11.206 --> 51:12.114
and could be a little bit nicer.

51:12.144 --> 51:12.954
Okay, shut up.

51:12.984 --> 51:14.817
Please, shut up, okay?

51:15.738 --> 51:19.162
We're in a situation right now, okay?

51:19.192 --> 51:21.122
Just-just tryin' to...

51:21.152 --> 51:23.402
Lighten the mood right now.

51:28.843 --> 51:32.676
Definitely could use
some marital intercourse.

51:36.385 --> 51:37.585
Shh.

51:41.822 --> 51:43.392
These uh...

51:43.422 --> 51:46.537
These branches and
this-this weird broken tree,

51:46.567 --> 51:49.187
I-I-I'm almost positive
we've been here before.

51:49.217 --> 51:51.837
We've been going
in the same direction all day.

51:51.867 --> 51:53.113
So, no.

51:53.711 --> 51:54.911
- Yeah.
- 'Cause this looks exactly

51:54.941 --> 51:56.754
like what we've passed.

51:56.784 --> 51:58.108
Well no, dude, we've been
going in the same direction,

51:58.138 --> 51:59.538
we haven't passed this at all.

51:59.568 --> 52:00.938
I mean, we've been going that,

52:00.968 --> 52:02.660
we've been going, coming from
that direction the whole time

52:02.690 --> 52:04.303
so, we need to keep going that direction.

52:04.333 --> 52:06.145
All we're going is looking for the stream.

52:06.175 --> 52:07.988
If we follow the stream, we can find food.

52:08.018 --> 52:09.146
We can just follow that.

52:09.176 --> 52:10.624
Uh...

52:10.654 --> 52:11.976
I'm pretty sure this is ours.

52:12.006 --> 52:13.487
Look, these are cut.
- Dude, no, dude...

52:13.517 --> 52:14.527
These are cut.

52:14.557 --> 52:15.463
We cut these.

52:15.493 --> 52:16.370
We've been going

52:16.400 --> 52:17.600
the same direction...
- Trying to get kindling.

52:18.572 --> 52:20.024
We've been going the
same direction all day.

52:20.054 --> 52:22.963
There's no way we could have
passed that before, okay?

52:22.993 --> 52:25.942
Just keep going in this
direction, we'll be fine.

52:25.972 --> 52:28.334
Just for a second, I can't,

52:28.364 --> 52:30.038
I can't keep going at this clip, man.

52:30.068 --> 52:32.118
We have to keep moving.

52:32.148 --> 52:33.348
No.

52:35.030 --> 52:37.863
There's no shame in just a minute.

52:39.554 --> 52:41.588
Dude, we really need
to keep moving, dude.

52:41.618 --> 52:43.652
It's starting to snow again, let's hurry.

52:43.682 --> 52:45.517
I know it's snowing.

52:45.547 --> 52:47.382
It's always snowing.

52:47.412 --> 52:48.964
Let's just...

52:48.994 --> 52:50.368
Dude, we can't stop.

52:50.398 --> 52:51.384
- Just let me get some...
- We can't stop.

52:51.414 --> 52:55.829
Some of the canteen, and
then I'm right back at it.

52:55.859 --> 52:56.754
Get some water.

52:56.784 --> 52:58.784
- All right.
- Thank you.

53:00.452 --> 53:01.652
Man, these...

53:07.439 --> 53:08.936
Uh...

53:10.532 --> 53:11.760
No water?

53:11.790 --> 53:13.018
None.

53:15.357 --> 53:16.655
Yeah, totally.

53:16.685 --> 53:17.852
- I-I don't...
- Where's the other,

53:17.882 --> 53:19.887
where's the other canteen?

53:19.917 --> 53:21.038
We don't have another canteen.

53:21.068 --> 53:23.030
You brought a canteen
as one of your items.

53:23.060 --> 53:23.833
Yeah, didn't you have,

53:23.863 --> 53:26.379
you had another one right?
- I don't...

53:26.409 --> 53:27.825
So that's
the only water we had?

53:29.559 --> 53:30.759
No, I didn't let it get empty.

53:30.789 --> 53:32.761
It was your job to fill the water bottle.

53:32.791 --> 53:35.207
I did fill the water
bottle, but you carried it.

53:35.237 --> 53:37.873
I didn't, I-I had
nothing to drink today.

53:37.903 --> 53:39.310
What did you do?

53:39.340 --> 53:40.748
I didn't...

53:41.804 --> 53:43.659
The cap was on tight, right?

53:43.689 --> 53:44.464
Yeah.

53:44.494 --> 53:45.297
- Yeah!
- Okay.

53:45.327 --> 53:46.531
Jesus Christ, it's your canteen!

53:46.561 --> 53:49.410
I don't know why you...
- I know it's my canteen.

53:49.440 --> 53:52.289
It was your job to fill
the fucking bottle, okay?

53:52.319 --> 53:53.967
Come on, we need to get more water.

53:53.997 --> 53:54.999
I need a, I need a minute.

53:55.029 --> 53:55.802
No!

53:55.832 --> 53:57.519
No, no, we have to get more water.

53:57.549 --> 53:58.322
I need a minute!

53:58.352 --> 53:59.797
Give me a minute, okay?

53:59.827 --> 54:01.067
Give me a minute!

54:01.097 --> 54:02.889
You knew what you were signing up for.

54:02.919 --> 54:04.891
This is not for the weak.

54:04.921 --> 54:06.863
That's all you are is weak.

54:06.893 --> 54:09.167
We need to keep moving,
or else we're gonna die.

54:09.197 --> 54:10.415
You understand that?

54:10.445 --> 54:11.633
This is a survival show.

54:11.663 --> 54:14.057
You can't sit down like this.

54:14.087 --> 54:16.481
Don't you fucking call me weak.

54:17.868 --> 54:22.270
- What the fuck kind of...
- You fucking fucker!

54:22.300 --> 54:23.073
Fine...
- We'll find

54:23.103 --> 54:23.949
the fucking water!
- Here's your show.

54:23.979 --> 54:24.752
No, let's go.

54:24.782 --> 54:26.282
There's your show.

54:28.047 --> 54:31.127
Let me tell you something, hey.

54:31.157 --> 54:32.357
One time.

54:33.171 --> 54:34.754
That's all you get.

54:39.113 --> 54:40.435
Well, take me to the stream,

54:40.465 --> 54:42.039
'cause you know how to find everything!

54:43.908 --> 54:45.492
Yeah, so lead me to the water.

54:45.522 --> 54:46.930
You're being a useless shit!

54:46.960 --> 54:48.339
I have to do everything!

54:48.369 --> 54:51.119
Douse me in the water, captain.

54:52.453 --> 54:53.761
Hey, here's one.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.455
I know this isn't in your book.

54:55.485 --> 54:56.685
Help!

54:57.364 --> 54:58.605
Help!
- Shut up!

54:58.635 --> 54:59.876
Shut the fuck up!

55:11.367 --> 55:12.604
Hey, hold up.

55:12.634 --> 55:13.872
One second.

55:17.399 --> 55:19.231
Look.

55:19.261 --> 55:20.844
That's a shoe.

55:20.874 --> 55:22.427
Yeah, it's a boot.

55:22.457 --> 55:23.290
Why?
- Yeah, but it looks like

55:23.320 --> 55:24.540
there's like...

55:26.479 --> 55:29.630
Some blood on it, like dried blood.

55:29.660 --> 55:31.148
That's not blood.

55:31.178 --> 55:32.830
Then what is it?

55:32.860 --> 55:34.483
Dirt, it's dirt.

55:34.513 --> 55:36.208
Who would leave
a boot in the middle...

55:36.238 --> 55:37.933
You find all
sorts of shit in the woods.

55:37.963 --> 55:39.700
How would I know?

55:39.730 --> 55:41.306
I think we should call somebody.

55:41.336 --> 55:42.668
- No.
- We found that campsite

55:42.698 --> 55:43.862
just a couple of days ago...

55:43.892 --> 55:45.027
And now we're finding,

55:45.057 --> 55:47.865
we're finding boots and abandoned clothes.

55:49.089 --> 55:51.273
I mean, how, who knows how
long this has been here?

55:53.214 --> 55:54.414
This is a show, right?

55:54.444 --> 55:55.644
So okay, um...

55:57.201 --> 55:58.401
Folks...

56:00.529 --> 56:03.592
It's important if you find clear signs

56:03.622 --> 56:06.585
of people in distress that you
do everything in your power

56:06.615 --> 56:07.989
to help them.

56:08.019 --> 56:09.363
Oh, fuck off.

56:09.393 --> 56:10.565
This is not the show.

56:10.595 --> 56:11.738
It's not the show.

56:11.768 --> 56:12.782
You're right, it's not the show,

56:12.812 --> 56:14.852
so get out the satellite
phone and let's call some help

56:14.882 --> 56:15.776
for these people.
- No, we're not getting out

56:15.806 --> 56:16.579
the satellite phone.

56:16.609 --> 56:18.164
We're not doing anything, okay?

56:18.194 --> 56:19.892
We're gonna make our survival show.

56:19.922 --> 56:21.591
That's why we're out here, okay?

56:21.621 --> 56:24.244
We're not here to be a rescue team, okay?

56:24.274 --> 56:26.073
Well, someone has one boot.

56:26.103 --> 56:28.098
Tell me something, Mr. Survivalist Expert,

56:28.128 --> 56:30.981
how far can you make it
in the harsh wilderness

56:31.011 --> 56:34.481
with constant fucking sleet with one boot?

56:36.147 --> 56:37.347
That's not our problem.

56:37.377 --> 56:39.136
Our problem is survival, okay?

56:39.166 --> 56:40.493
We need to get ourselves through this.

56:40.523 --> 56:41.546
Give me the phone.

56:41.576 --> 56:43.448
- No, no, no.
- Give me the phone.

56:43.478 --> 56:44.321
You're not, you're not getting the phone.

56:44.351 --> 56:45.164
- Just give me the phone.
- You're not

56:45.194 --> 56:46.134
getting the phone.
- We won't need the show.

56:46.164 --> 56:47.268
- Just give me the phone.
- You're not

56:47.298 --> 56:48.768
getting the phone!

56:49.685 --> 56:50.983
I'm gonna take it, then.

56:51.013 --> 56:52.554
No, get the fuck off me!

56:52.584 --> 56:54.126
Get the fuck off me!

56:54.156 --> 56:55.356
Fuck!

57:05.652 --> 57:07.735
We need to go.

57:09.073 --> 57:10.273
Yeah.

57:15.762 --> 57:16.962
I'm comin'.

57:16.992 --> 57:18.192
Well...

57:19.122 --> 57:22.039
I decided to uh, take a walk to uh,

57:22.917 --> 57:27.885
you know, relieve some
tension and uh, it's hailing.

57:27.915 --> 57:31.552
So uh, it is a lot
colder than we'd planned.

57:33.279 --> 57:35.906
And I'm hoping that it stops,

57:35.936 --> 57:40.633
uh, as fast it came because
this is a very difficult thing

57:40.663 --> 57:41.863
to, to handle.

57:44.921 --> 57:46.121
Nature, right?

57:49.491 --> 57:50.691
It just...

57:50.721 --> 57:51.835
Won't...

57:51.865 --> 57:53.065
Stop.

58:00.952 --> 58:05.102
It's uh, it's starting
to get kind of dark.

58:05.132 --> 58:07.602
And uh, I don't see any water.

58:09.689 --> 58:11.752
Your complaining is not helping.

58:11.782 --> 58:14.282
I mean, should we start
thinking about camp?

58:14.312 --> 58:16.813
Uh, I'm serious, we do
not have much time left.

58:16.843 --> 58:18.896
We have to keep movin'.

58:24.172 --> 58:27.733
I'm, I'm telling you right
now, we're not near water.

58:27.763 --> 58:28.536
Yes, we are.

58:28.566 --> 58:29.917
We need, we need to keep movin'.

58:29.947 --> 58:30.720
Here.

58:30.750 --> 58:32.507
Stand still for one second.

58:32.537 --> 58:33.737
Listen.

58:34.493 --> 58:36.850
Do you hear anything other than the sleet?

58:36.880 --> 58:38.196
No, and the more you talk,

58:38.226 --> 58:41.255
the less we'll be able
to hear running water.

58:41.285 --> 58:43.044
All right, all right.

58:43.074 --> 58:46.262
But we're, we-we cannot walk
like this through night.

58:46.292 --> 58:47.598
You know we'll get worse.

58:47.628 --> 58:48.934
We'll get lost worse.

58:50.030 --> 58:53.318
We cannot keep this
pace up once it's dark.

58:53.348 --> 58:54.121
Are you listening?

58:54.151 --> 58:54.954
- Yes, I'm listening.
- I mean,

58:54.984 --> 58:55.834
we're on the same page?
- I'm hearing you.

58:55.864 --> 58:56.835
I'm hearing you.

58:56.865 --> 58:58.065
Okay.

59:00.984 --> 59:04.856
Are we really gonna hike
through all this sleet?

59:04.886 --> 59:06.435
We're not gonna try to make a shelter?

59:06.465 --> 59:08.015
If we started now, we'd have it ready

59:08.045 --> 59:10.453
by the time it's dark.

59:10.483 --> 59:13.932
You know, I really need you to man up.

59:13.962 --> 59:15.408
And just do your job.

59:15.438 --> 59:16.855
I am doing my job.

59:16.885 --> 59:19.444
I'm talking to a camera
and I'm giving you advice.

59:19.474 --> 59:20.894
Suggestions.

59:20.924 --> 59:22.325
Thoughts.
- You need to,

59:22.355 --> 59:23.757
you need to...
- Opinions.

59:27.816 --> 59:31.566
Well, uh, the good news
is, this uh, sleet...

59:34.485 --> 59:35.876
Is pretty much gone.

59:35.906 --> 59:37.298
Um, it's October and...

59:40.105 --> 59:44.224
The uh, low for today was
supposed to be 51 degrees,

59:44.254 --> 59:47.476
uh, which is an important
element of survival.

59:47.506 --> 59:50.226
And that is, uh, always be prepared.

59:50.256 --> 59:53.828
We wore uh, warmer clothing
than we needed, uh,

59:53.858 --> 59:56.719
because we knew it could be
colder than we were expecting.

59:56.749 --> 59:58.495
And uh, we wore winter hats.

59:58.525 --> 01:00:02.699
We did not pack gloves,
which was not wise, but uh...

01:00:02.729 --> 01:00:05.183
This wind is really bad, man!

01:00:05.213 --> 01:00:07.057
We're not gonna be okay if we stay in it!

01:00:07.087 --> 01:00:08.781
We've gotta find somewhere to go!

01:00:08.811 --> 01:00:09.800
Dude, we just
have to keep walking, okay?

01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:11.902
We have gotta
find somewhere to go!

01:00:11.932 --> 01:00:14.428
This is, I mean, this is the
worst I think I've ever felt!

01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:16.431
I can't feel my feet and I
know you can't feel yours

01:00:16.461 --> 01:00:17.299
standing out here!

01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:19.226
Our best option
is to keep walking, okay?

01:00:19.256 --> 01:00:20.029
If we don't find shelter,

01:00:20.059 --> 01:00:21.678
we're not gonna get to tomorrow!

01:00:21.708 --> 01:00:23.985
We're not gonna make it, if
we don't get out of this wind

01:00:24.015 --> 01:00:26.232
right fucking now!

01:00:26.262 --> 01:00:28.137
Come on, we gotta...

01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:30.012
Do you see that?

01:00:30.042 --> 01:00:31.294
Why would
there be a tent out here?

01:00:31.324 --> 01:00:32.565
There's a
fucking tent right there,

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:34.050
I don't give a shit why it's there!

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.506
We need to get inside of this now!

01:00:35.536 --> 01:00:37.605
I don't care if Jack the
fucking Ripper is in that tent...

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:39.705
- Dude, we have to keep going!
- If, if we stay in this wind,

01:00:39.735 --> 01:00:41.226
we are dead!
- We have to keep going!

01:00:41.256 --> 01:00:42.717
My nose is going
to fucking fall off!

01:00:42.747 --> 01:00:47.307
Shut the fuck up and
get in the fucking tent!

01:01:25.138 --> 01:01:27.555
You won't find it.

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:30.323
W

01:01:31.423 --> 01:01:33.448
I threw the
satellite phone away.

01:01:33.478 --> 01:01:35.504
What, are you fucking kidding me?

01:01:35.534 --> 01:01:36.618
You...

01:01:36.648 --> 01:01:38.148
Oh my fucking God!

01:01:42.446 --> 01:01:43.646
What the f...

01:01:48.466 --> 01:01:49.666
Shit...

01:01:50.778 --> 01:01:51.978
Oh...

01:01:52.907 --> 01:01:55.042
What are you, what are you talking about?

01:01:55.072 --> 01:01:56.457
We have to help them.

01:01:56.487 --> 01:01:57.687
It's our job.

01:02:01.241 --> 01:02:02.441
We have to go.

01:02:06.219 --> 01:02:07.719
Go where?

01:02:12.924 --> 01:02:14.174
Jesus Christ...

01:02:20.215 --> 01:02:22.952
Come on, s-slow down, I can't,
I can't keep up with you

01:02:22.982 --> 01:02:25.147
doing it like this.

01:02:25.177 --> 01:02:27.342
They went this way.

01:02:30.922 --> 01:02:32.580
Hold up, hold up!

01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:34.772
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:02:34.802 --> 01:02:37.142
At least take a camera, like,

01:02:37.172 --> 01:02:39.512
we gotta do the show, right?

01:02:39.542 --> 01:02:40.742
Do the show.

01:02:41.762 --> 01:02:44.516
Okay, 'cause we're-we're
out here doing a show.

01:02:44.546 --> 01:02:47.690
I mean, we're gonna find these
people and help them but,

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.654
we're out here doing a show.

01:02:49.684 --> 01:02:51.618
Keep-keep it in mind, man.

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:58.773
This way.

01:02:58.803 --> 01:03:00.843
Wait, now, if
we find these people,

01:03:00.873 --> 01:03:02.444
they're clearly hurt.

01:03:02.474 --> 01:03:04.016
Are, shouldn't...

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:07.568
Shouldn't we worry about
like, what if we're in danger?

01:03:07.598 --> 01:03:10.075
Like, there was blood all over the tent.

01:03:10.105 --> 01:03:12.006
Don't you think we should be careful?

01:03:12.036 --> 01:03:14.460
Like, how would we protect ourselves?

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.915
We don't, we're not prepared for this.

01:03:16.945 --> 01:03:18.524
This is our job.

01:03:18.554 --> 01:03:20.114
We have to help them.

01:03:20.144 --> 01:03:21.291
Help who?

01:03:21.321 --> 01:03:25.488
You're, I don't understand
what you're talking about.

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:29.103
Please slow down, man.

01:03:29.133 --> 01:03:31.177
This is breaking me.

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:32.263
Please.

01:03:32.293 --> 01:03:34.400
We can't keep going like this.

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:36.226
We can't waste any time.

01:03:36.256 --> 01:03:38.022
Well, at least tell me,

01:03:38.052 --> 01:03:39.740
where are we going, what direction?

01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:41.341
Like, why are we going this way?

01:03:41.371 --> 01:03:42.943
You keep looking at the ground.

01:03:42.973 --> 01:03:45.335
I'm not seeing anything.

01:03:45.365 --> 01:03:46.226
What is it?

01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:48.506
Show me what you're seeing.

01:03:50.857 --> 01:03:52.913
They went this way.

01:03:52.943 --> 01:03:53.716
Who?

01:03:53.746 --> 01:03:54.955
Who went this way?

01:03:54.985 --> 01:03:56.057
We're coming!

01:03:56.087 --> 01:03:57.025
What are you...

01:03:57.055 --> 01:03:57.963
We're coming!

01:03:57.993 --> 01:03:59.063
You've gotta hold off!

01:03:59.093 --> 01:04:00.401
I can't keep up!

01:04:00.431 --> 01:04:01.827
I c...

01:04:01.857 --> 01:04:03.190
I can't keep up!

01:04:05.289 --> 01:04:06.489
Please!

01:04:07.653 --> 01:04:08.853
Hold on!

01:04:17.416 --> 01:04:18.904
We're close.

01:04:18.934 --> 01:04:20.184
Close to what?

01:04:20.214 --> 01:04:21.942
They're here.

01:04:21.972 --> 01:04:23.701
Who's they?

01:04:23.731 --> 01:04:24.931
Pl...

01:04:25.439 --> 01:04:27.975
I know you're not usually
the most communicative guy

01:04:28.005 --> 01:04:30.541
in the world, but this
is pretty impressive man,

01:04:30.571 --> 01:04:32.060
even for you, come on.

01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:33.773
It's getting...

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:36.794
We, why would we, it's getting dark.

01:04:36.824 --> 01:04:39.816
It's gonna be dark in no time flat.

01:04:39.846 --> 01:04:41.816
Hank, this is our job.

01:04:43.467 --> 01:04:45.050
We have to do this.

01:04:49.773 --> 01:04:52.751
That way, straight ahead?

01:04:52.781 --> 01:04:53.981
Come on.

01:04:59.093 --> 01:05:02.290
Okay, slow down, we can't
go this hard at night!

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.829
You know what we can't!

01:05:03.859 --> 01:05:05.368
Come on, slow down!

01:05:06.132 --> 01:05:07.332
I can't even keep up with you!

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:08.880
We're gonna, we're gonna trip and break

01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:10.380
our fuckin' heads!

01:05:12.989 --> 01:05:14.798
They were dragged by their feet.

01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:15.601
This way.

01:05:15.631 --> 01:05:17.483
Who was dragged by their feet?

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:18.731
And if we need, they need so much help,

01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:21.953
why don't we find a road
or go to the pickup spot,

01:05:21.983 --> 01:05:26.150
or do something other than
wander in the woods in the dark?

01:05:27.784 --> 01:05:29.201
Fucking Christ...

01:05:31.039 --> 01:05:32.239
They're close.

01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:33.212
Who's close?

01:05:33.242 --> 01:05:35.075
We have to find her.

01:05:36.047 --> 01:05:38.307
Who are you talking about?

01:05:38.337 --> 01:05:39.807
Wait, come on!
- We're coming!

01:05:39.837 --> 01:05:40.973
- I ca...
- We're coming!

01:05:41.003 --> 01:05:43.368
I can't keep up with
you if you're going that fast!

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:45.793
I can't keep up with you

01:05:45.823 --> 01:05:48.218
if you're going that fast!

01:05:48.248 --> 01:05:49.448
Fucking...

01:06:03.262 --> 01:06:04.462
Oh, fuck...

01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:11.016
I am so fucking lost.

01:06:13.921 --> 01:06:15.121
Jesus Christ.

01:06:18.366 --> 01:06:22.125
Okay.

01:06:23.261 --> 01:06:24.678
I gotta find him.

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:31.328
He's a fucking asshole
and he's insane but...

01:06:31.358 --> 01:06:35.347
He's gonna, he's gonna die alone out here.

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:46.827
Fuck!

01:06:58.348 --> 01:06:59.548
Okay, I hear you.

01:06:59.578 --> 01:07:00.778
I hear you.

01:07:17.451 --> 01:07:18.651
I hear you...

01:07:23.845 --> 01:07:26.811
I'm coming.

01:07:35.793 --> 01:07:37.710
Jesus fucking Christ...

01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:44.330
Oh my God.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.560
You're...

01:07:47.039 --> 01:07:48.239
Are you okay?

01:07:50.887 --> 01:07:52.637
Christ, are you hurt?

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:56.150
Dallas?

01:07:56.725 --> 01:07:57.925
Are you okay?

01:07:59.037 --> 01:08:00.237
What happened?

01:08:02.422 --> 01:08:03.622
We-we've gotta get help.

01:08:03.652 --> 01:08:04.833
We'll get you help too.

01:08:04.863 --> 01:08:07.666
We

01:08:09.773 --> 01:08:12.179
Goddamn it, answer me!

01:08:12.209 --> 01:08:13.409
Oh my God...

01:08:14.376 --> 01:08:16.126
What happened to you?

01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:18.560
I found them.

01:08:19.421 --> 01:08:20.621
I saved them.

01:08:21.515 --> 01:08:24.451
Who, who did you save?

01:08:26.895 --> 01:08:28.455
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:08:33.277 --> 01:08:34.830
I can help you!

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:36.412
I can save you!

01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:39.602
Let me help you!

01:08:42.688 --> 01:08:43.888
What the...

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:31.649
Must save them.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.863
Save them.

01:09:32.894 --> 01:09:34.094
Save them all.

01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:38.901
I'm not stupid, I'm not stupid.

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:40.401
I'm gonna go home.

01:10:03.136 --> 01:10:04.771
I

01:10:04.801 --> 01:10:05.604
I think we got it.

01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:07.884
I think, I think it's good.

01:10:08.941 --> 01:10:10.464
I mean did you,
did you think it worked

01:10:10.494 --> 01:10:12.018
or do you think we
should do the end again?

01:10:12.048 --> 01:10:13.356
No, I think,
I think I came out fine.

01:10:13.386 --> 01:10:14.938
I mean, I don't think
we have to do it again.

01:10:14.968 --> 01:10:16.924
- All right but...
- I think it came out fine.

01:10:16.954 --> 01:10:18.875
If it sucks,
we're-we're watching it tonight.

01:10:18.905 --> 01:10:20.826
If it sucks, we're comin'
right back and we're,

01:10:20.856 --> 01:10:22.125
we're shootin' it again tomorrow night.

01:10:22.155 --> 01:10:24.149
And I don't, I don't give a
shit how cold it is, okay?

01:10:24.585 --> 01:10:25.785
Do you know how cold it is?

01:10:25.815 --> 01:10:26.648
You're not, you're not...
- I'm, I-I am freezing.

01:10:26.678 --> 01:10:28.216
You're the
one that's half naked.

01:10:28.246 --> 01:10:29.755
Fair, fair point, but you know,

01:10:29.785 --> 01:10:31.541
that's what, that's what
people want to buy, right?

01:10:31.571 --> 01:10:32.374
- Oh, that's true.
- Not the chicks

01:10:32.404 --> 01:10:33.216
at the beginning, it's you...

01:10:33.246 --> 01:10:37.928
- No, it's true, it's true.
- It's you at the, right.

01:10:40.617 --> 01:10:42.018
What's that?

01:10:42.048 --> 01:10:43.450
I don't know.
