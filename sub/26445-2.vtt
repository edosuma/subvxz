00:05.005 --> 00:07.966
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:08.425 --> 00:11.720
All right, my lady dudes.
Time for soccer. [whistle blowing]

00:12.012 --> 00:14.222
I love working with you, Miss Whistle.

00:14.305 --> 00:17.684
I blow into your mouth,
and you scream out your keister.

00:17.767 --> 00:18.893
[whistle blows, chuckles]

00:18.977 --> 00:21.187
-Banter.
-Go Jesse!

00:21.438 --> 00:24.065
-Love you, Jelly Bean.
-Guys! We're just warming up!

00:24.149 --> 00:27.068
So your parents are here together.
That's probably a good sign, right?

00:27.152 --> 00:28.278
Oh, please. It's bullshit.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.697
My dad's living in the basement,
my mom's dating a woman.

00:30.780 --> 00:33.158
Oh, okay. Argh!

00:33.241 --> 00:35.952
I am playing it cool,
but some of that is new information.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.413
-This isn't even real soccer.
-What? 'Cause they're girls?

00:38.496 --> 00:42.917
Uh, yeah, sports are played by men,
starving dogs, and juiced up horses.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.962
-I can't believe Jesse dumped you.
-Oh no. That's fake news.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.089
-What?
-She didn't dump me. I dumped her.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.299
Uh, Nick?

00:49.382 --> 00:50.508
[unzips]

00:50.592 --> 00:52.052
[Andrew]
Whoa!

00:52.761 --> 00:53.845
-Boobs.
-Boobs!

00:53.928 --> 00:55.513
[Andrew]
Where did those come from?

00:55.597 --> 00:57.348
-Below the neck... above the waist.
-Boobs!

00:57.432 --> 00:59.934
-It's definitely them.
-They're looking right at me.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.815
[scoffs] Boys are so gross.

01:05.899 --> 01:10.111
Wow! That uniform is
doing something different.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.072
You're just doing
exactly what they're doing.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.490
-You're objectifying her.
-Oh!

01:13.573 --> 01:15.700
-But she looks really good, right?
-Yeah.

01:15.784 --> 01:19.120
Those boobs! They're too awesome.
Watch out! I'm coming in hard.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.830
Real hard! I'm going down!

01:20.914 --> 01:22.749
[crashes, grunts]

01:22.832 --> 01:24.042
I can't feel my legs.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.002
I have to go to the bathroom right now.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.046
Kill me. Somebody kill me.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.381
I don't want to live my life in a chair.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.259
It's not all bad.Â You can do Disney world
in an hour and a half.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.087
MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS WITH MATTHEW

02:09.170 --> 02:10.380
Breaking news:

02:10.463 --> 02:13.174
Boob fever, which is not breast cancer,

02:13.258 --> 02:14.843
is sweeping Bridgeton Middle School.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.720
Patient zero is Gena Alvarez.

02:17.804 --> 02:21.057
Gena has tested positive for big tits.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.893
I took to the hallways
to get some uninformed opinions.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.812
I wonder
what the new girl's nipples look like.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.105
Um, she's not new.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.649
She's been going to school with us
since first grade.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.943
They're probably
the same color as her mouth, right?

02:32.026 --> 02:34.654
Nips match lips. That's what my brothers
always say. [laughs]

02:34.737 --> 02:37.907
This might be controversial,
but I'm gonna come out as pro boobs.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.742
They're a beautiful paradox,

02:39.826 --> 02:41.953
both weightless and heavy
at the same time.

02:42.036 --> 02:45.373
I heard she has to wear two sports bras.

02:45.456 --> 02:48.710
I would literally kill a man,
a decent hard-working family man

02:48.793 --> 02:51.004
for the chance to touch
those big mushy breasts.

02:51.087 --> 02:54.215
-When does this air?
-Why is everybody so obsessed with boobs?

02:54.299 --> 02:57.218
[laughs] I love them.
I love them so much,

02:57.302 --> 03:00.305
'cause whistles, they're on strings,

03:00.388 --> 03:02.515
so when you accidentally swallow 'em,

03:02.599 --> 03:04.475
you can yank 'em right back out.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.730
[Gena groans]

03:08.813 --> 03:09.856
-[door slams shut]
-[sighs]

03:09.939 --> 03:11.733
My boobs don't even bounce when I run.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.360
And your taters are growing in uneven.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.820
One's a Yukon Gold,

03:15.904 --> 03:17.447
-one's a little fing-a-ling.
-[door slams open]

03:17.530 --> 03:20.450
[crying] Oh my God! You guys!
DeVon broke up with me.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.828
Oh, holy heck. Another broken heart.
That really stinks.

03:23.912 --> 03:27.123
I'll bet he dumped me for Gina
and her slutty boobs.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.209
-Uh--
-Big boobs aren't even that great.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.793
-Right, Lola?
-Yeah.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.713
You know, my mom wrote me a check
to get a breast reduction,

03:33.796 --> 03:37.342
but, I spent it on a  Pretty Little Liars
meet and greet.

03:37.425 --> 03:40.720
That sounds like a good investment.
Look, you should all calm down.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.180
We already live in a society

03:42.263 --> 03:44.891
that fixates on the female form,
and a   psychologically--

03:44.974 --> 03:47.810
Listen, decimating way
to many young women.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.605
Boo, feminism. I am not with her.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.482
-Okay, well, anyway--
-[Lola] Magga.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.609
I read somewhere
that no one likes their boobs.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.444
-I don't mind my boobs.
-What boobs?

03:56.527 --> 03:58.863
You're flatter than the earth, flat-so.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.573
-What?
-Lola!

04:00.657 --> 04:03.368
-Actually, the earth is not flat.
-Tell my pastor that.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.787
Missy, I wish I didn't have to wear a bra.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.664
What is that? An undershirt?

04:07.747 --> 04:10.416
It's Kirkland Signature.
They also make water.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.417
That's sweet.

04:11.501 --> 04:15.338
You're actually very lucky
to be totally completely flat.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.756
Boys will never bother you,

04:16.839 --> 04:19.050
'cause you know,
there's nothing there, right?

04:19.133 --> 04:21.803
Uh... Yeah. I guess I am lucky.

04:21.886 --> 04:24.973
I'm pretty actually lucky too,
because, like,

04:25.098 --> 04:27.725
remember the  Pretty Little Liars
meet and greet?

04:28.059 --> 04:30.812
Gina? Ooh!
She got such a bangin' body, bro.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.563
You love her.
You want to marry those boobs.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.899
I would 100% marry her boobs.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.069
It would be a tasteful ceremony.
Catered, open bar,

04:38.152 --> 04:40.363
but wine and beer only.
I'm not made of money.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.865
I now pronounce you man and boobs.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.659
You may motorboat the bride.

04:44.742 --> 04:45.702
Mazel tov!

04:45.785 --> 04:46.828
I love you so much.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.916
-Hey, look at me! I'm Gina.
-Jay!

04:52.041 --> 04:53.960
-I have huge jugs.
-Jay!

04:54.043 --> 04:55.461
I'm tucking my penis between my legs.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.631
I'm definitely not doing this again
when I get home. [chuckles]

04:58.715 --> 05:00.717
You're pinching it so tight.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.635
Just kidding. I'm Jay now, guys.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.887
And my dick, whoo, feels amazing.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.973
All right boys, let's--
Oh no!

05:07.056 --> 05:08.808
There's a naked lady in here.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.811
Did I walk into the triangle body
locker room again?

05:11.894 --> 05:14.188
-Coach Steve, that's Jay.
-Jay's a naked lady?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.606
What? No.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.234
Have you never seen a naked woman before?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.236
-It's on my to-do list.
-What?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.113
Sorry, let's just fill in
some blanks real quick.

05:22.196 --> 05:23.823
-You're 47...
-Yeah.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.950
-...but you never seen a naked woman.
-No way!

05:26.034 --> 05:29.037
Let's put aside for just a moment
that you are our sex ed teacher.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.580
-I'm your guy.
-Coach Steve...

05:30.663 --> 05:32.498
-have you ever had sex?
-What?

05:32.582 --> 05:35.251
Of course not.
I'm not a mommy or a daddy.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.919
Yeah, come on. What do I look like?

05:37.003 --> 05:39.756
You do know you can have sex
without having a baby.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.632
Are you messing with me, Matthew?

05:41.716 --> 05:44.510
Oh, bless your heart,
you un-sharpened pencil.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.220
Speaking of sharpened pencils,

05:46.304 --> 05:49.223
Oh, boy. I might have to
break off the tip. [grunts]

05:50.641 --> 05:53.311
Ooh! I'm flat as a cheese board.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.021
Missy, if you're a cheese board,

05:55.104 --> 05:56.939
then I'd happily be the Manchego

05:57.023 --> 05:59.359
and dried apricots that rest upon you.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.361
Oh, thanks, Nathan Fillion.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.196
That's very sweet of you to say.

06:03.279 --> 06:05.531
-Ha! Too bad it's bullshit!
-What?

06:05.615 --> 06:06.949
-You look like a boy!
-[gasps]

06:07.033 --> 06:11.037
Jeez Louise. Your chest is concave.
It's like a spoon.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.456
My mom says I'm going to develop
in my own time.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.750
-Ha! You fell for that?
-Holy heck!

06:15.833 --> 06:17.126
You're ugly and stupid!

06:17.210 --> 06:19.545
My mom wouldn't lie to me.
She's my best friend.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.006
Best friend? What a bleeping loser.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.674
Your hope is embarrassing.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.885
Don't listen to her, Missy.
I find your hope winning.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.261
What do you know, Fillion?

06:27.345 --> 06:29.889
You're just a sex symbol
for nerds and geriatrics.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.141
-Gasp!
-And you have way more hair

06:32.225 --> 06:34.310
-than you really need.
-Do I? I've wondered that before.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.604
-You make me sick.
-Oh! You're really mean.

06:36.687 --> 06:39.649
I'm honest!
Take a hard look in the mirror, lady.

06:39.732 --> 06:43.486
You look like an understuffed scarecrow
in those Baby Gap overalls.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.948
I'm just more focused on function
than fashion... I guess.

06:47.031 --> 06:50.868
News flash:
Nobody wants to see that bummer of a body.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.954
-Holy Schnikes.
-Cover it up, you sock puppet.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.747
-Maybe I should.
-Do you have one

06:54.831 --> 06:57.375
in size big boy fatty barrel-chest fatso?

06:57.458 --> 06:58.459
It's for a friend.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.669
[plates clattering]

06:59.752 --> 07:01.504
So, how's Jesse holding up?

07:01.587 --> 07:03.673
I cannot believe she ran away with Jay.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.091
It's a real cry for help.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.927
Remember when Judd ran away
and then came back a week later?

07:08.010 --> 07:10.054
How do you know I'm the original Judd?
[laughs]

07:10.138 --> 07:12.265
If you were an impostor,
I'd love you even more.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.851
I'm pretty sure Jesse's fine.
We've been focused on...

07:14.934 --> 07:16.686
[chuckles]
some other things.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.813
-Two things in particular.
-[both giggling]

07:18.896 --> 07:20.565
What are you little perverts
talking about?

07:20.648 --> 07:22.358
Oh, it's nothing.

07:22.483 --> 07:25.611
-There's this new girl at school.
-Well, she's not new.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.572
But let's just say her body is.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.781
[both giggling]

07:28.865 --> 07:31.451
Hey, we're talking tits?
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was terrible.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.244
But you had time to stop for coffee.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.163
Joke's on you.
I brought this from home.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.164
-So what--
-I reused the cup.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.081
Now, hold on.

07:37.165 --> 07:40.001
You boys don't just like this girl
for her body, do you?

07:40.084 --> 07:42.753
-No.
-No, she has a nice face, too.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.255
Have you even spoken to her?

07:44.338 --> 07:45.631
Yes, Leah.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.633
-I've spoken to her.
-[sneezes]

07:47.717 --> 07:50.011
Hey, if you're sick,
you know, just stay home.

07:50.595 --> 07:54.182
Okay, let's say I do like her breasts.
I mean, what's wrong with that?

07:54.265 --> 07:57.018
[sighs] Well,
there's nothing wrong with it per se.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.187
I mean, even I can appreciate
a nice set of boobs.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.855
-[spits]
-Ah!

08:00.938 --> 08:03.357
-This is vodka.
-Listen, you want me sharp or what?

08:03.441 --> 08:05.109
But it's how you guys
are talking about it.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.112
I'm sorry, you look at boobs, like,
in a lesbian way?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.197
No.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.617
-[chuckling]
-Women just admire each other's bodies

08:12.700 --> 08:14.702
-in a way that men don't.
-Exactly.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.246
Andrew, I think the mother
and the sister are about to fuck.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.541
Do you not know their names?
We're over here all the time.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.961
Sorry, yes.
Lexi and Rita are about to fuck.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.964
So, I just want to clarify.
It's okay for us to like boobs?

08:27.048 --> 08:30.343
Yes, but you can't treat a woman
like her boobs are all she is.

08:30.426 --> 08:33.387
And if you're really interested
in this girl, get to know her.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.015
Uh-huh.
Get to know her. Perhaps I shall.

08:36.098 --> 08:38.768
Argh! Don't say it like that, Dr. Tiny.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.561
You know, I just realized something.

08:40.686 --> 08:44.273
Every single person at this table has had
Diane's breasts in their mouth.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.608
-Well--
-Except for you, Andrew.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.361
All right, now Marcus is inviting you
to suck Rita's tits.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.612
-What?
-Oh, Andrew.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.573
-Why can't we live with the Borks?
-You think their last name is Bork?

08:52.657 --> 08:54.534
Yeah. Licorice Bork.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.077
[doorbell rings]

08:56.827 --> 08:57.745
[door opens]

08:57.828 --> 09:01.082
[woman] Hey, Shannie! Oh, wow!
Your hair looks great.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.668
Thanks. I tried flat iron, but...

09:03.751 --> 09:06.295
Hey! I thought you were gonna wear
that blue top that we got?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.756
From the Rachel Maddow line
at Ross Dress For Less?

09:08.839 --> 09:10.925
Yeah, maybe I should. This top kind of...

09:11.008 --> 09:13.094
-If you want to.
-...makes me look short-necked.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.637
-[chuckles]
-Well, your word, not mine.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.180
I'm gonna go change.
I'll be right back.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.974
-Yeah, just wear the blue one.
-What the hell?

09:18.057 --> 09:20.309
When has my mom ever cared
about what she looks like?

09:20.393 --> 09:23.104
You know it's all her fault.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.855
Oh, hey, Jesse.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.399
Hello, Dina.

09:26.482 --> 09:28.609
Good. Use her name against her.

09:28.693 --> 09:32.446
Look, I know that this
must be tough for you. I get that.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.699
I hope that one day
we can be friends, yeah?

09:34.782 --> 09:38.369
Friends? I'd rather take
a two week cruise on a diaper barge

09:38.452 --> 09:41.372
-than be friends with this skank.
-Friends. Sure.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.040
-Great.
-Bitch, bye.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.292
S.S. DIAPER BARGE

09:44.375 --> 09:47.837
[grunts]
Why do baby doodie smell so sweet?

09:48.129 --> 09:51.340
Still better than hanging out
with Cantor Dina!

09:51.424 --> 09:52.842
IF YOU'RE SICK, JUST STAY HOME

09:52.925 --> 09:55.303
-I think I'm gonna talk to Gena at lunch.
-What?

09:55.386 --> 09:56.512
You're gonna talk to her?

09:56.596 --> 09:59.599
You want to borrow the cardigan
I carry around to cover my boners?

09:59.682 --> 10:01.017
What are we talking? Boners?
[exhales]

10:01.100 --> 10:03.853
'Cause I've got one right now,
and it's tucked between my legs.

10:03.936 --> 10:07.106
I am full-on Jaying off
right here in public

10:07.189 --> 10:09.692
and no one can tell!
[laughs]

10:09.775 --> 10:11.277
-[door opens]
-[Hormone hums]

10:11.360 --> 10:13.154
Missy, are you okay? You're never late.

10:13.237 --> 10:15.656
To be candid, Jesse,
I'm gross and flat,

10:15.740 --> 10:16.866
and my body's disgusting.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.076
-What? Missy--
-Might as well admit it.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.163
-Is this because of what Devin said?
-No. It's just... [sighs]

10:22.288 --> 10:24.624
-I finally took a hard look in the mirror.
-Oh, Missy...

10:24.707 --> 10:26.584
That's right, gross-o! Preach!

10:26.667 --> 10:27.960
Now, put up your hood,

10:28.044 --> 10:30.755
so people don't have to see
your weird pepperoni ears,

10:30.838 --> 10:33.007
-you ugly fudgling.
-[sighs deeply]

10:35.343 --> 10:37.803
Hey, Mr. Eliezer,
some of the kids was saying

10:37.887 --> 10:40.681
that you can have sex
without having a baby.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.059
-Yeah?
-Have you ever had sex?

10:43.142 --> 10:44.727
[sighs]
Of course, Steve.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.480
I used to help book
a live storytelling series.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.023
I've had sex. Everyone has.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.859
-Even the kids?
-No, the grown-ups.

10:51.942 --> 10:55.738
Hold on. You're telling me that
all the grown-ups are just going around

10:55.821 --> 10:57.823
doing the hoochie poochie with each other?

10:57.907 --> 11:00.284
If that's sex, then yeah.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.620
Mr. Eliezer,
I'm going to confide in you...

11:02.703 --> 11:04.121
-I'd rather you didn't.
-...because you're my best friend.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.123
-No, I'm not.
-I've never done sex.

11:06.207 --> 11:09.293
That actually makes
a tremendous amount of sense.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.962
What do you do?
Do you just masturbate constantly?

11:12.046 --> 11:13.756
Well, I ground the pepper once,

11:13.839 --> 11:16.008
-but my peanut got all bent.
-What?

11:16.092 --> 11:19.220
It looked like when someone lifts
a dachshund from the middle, you know?

11:19.303 --> 11:21.514
[grunts] I don't... Wow!

11:21.597 --> 11:22.848
Come on, you're my best friend.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.976
So then, what, do you just have
a lot of wet dreams?

11:26.060 --> 11:27.436
You mean sheet sneezes?

11:27.520 --> 11:30.022
Yeah, cause, you know,
sometimes I do bed wet thick.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.482
I can't believe you're a teacher.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.025
-I'm the sex ed teacher.
-Oh, no.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.652
Oh yeah, best friend.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.321
-Bye, see you later. I'm going to choir.
-Bye!

11:37.446 --> 11:39.115
Okay, I'm going to get to know Gina.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.534
And I'm gonna look her in the eyes
because she's more than just boobs.

11:41.617 --> 11:44.495
Hey, Gina... [chuckles]
Can I honk your horns?

11:44.578 --> 11:46.997
Guys, I asked Gena to honk her horns.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.959
Hey, don't listen to him.
I saw him sucking on a battery once.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.461
He was probably wetting it down
to shove it up his butt.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.088
[laughs]
Very funny.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.674
Shoving it like a kicker in the shin.

11:56.757 --> 11:57.717
Jesus Christ.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.301
Oh, what's this?

11:59.385 --> 12:01.387
Hey! Hey!
What are you gonna do?

12:02.638 --> 12:05.057
Is this weird bench
that's connected to the table taken?

12:05.683 --> 12:06.684
No.

12:06.767 --> 12:10.062
-Great. I can plop down.
-Okay?

12:10.146 --> 12:12.565
I usually sit on the side
of the cafeteria. It's nice.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.358
You can really see
staircase three from here.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.485
Yeah. It's a great view.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.903
Yeah, it's really nice.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.823
Anyway, great work
on the soccer pitch the other day.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.492
Thanks. You know,
in Europe they call it foosball.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.245
That's a really good
Coach Steve impression.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.080
You know, you're my best friend.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.834
Oh, yeah, you know what?
'Cause you're my best friend, so...

12:31.917 --> 12:34.170
Wow! Your Coach Steve
is like weirdly perfect.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.464
You know, I spend a lot of time with him,

12:36.547 --> 12:39.175
since, I'm the starting point guard
on the basketball team.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.177
-Yeah, I've seen you play.
-Oh, really?

12:41.260 --> 12:43.053
-You're like a little Muggsy Bogues.
-Well, you know,

12:43.137 --> 12:45.264
Muggsy Bogues is already pretty little,
but... [clears throat]

12:45.347 --> 12:47.933
Thanks. It's very weird
that you know 90s basketball.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.310
My brothers are obsessed with it.

12:49.393 --> 12:52.563
My brother, interestingly enough,
is obsessed with dissecting fetal pigs.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.524
Please do not bring up science.
That class is killing me.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.736
Maybe I can help. I don't want to brag,
but I am getting a low B, so...

12:58.819 --> 13:01.155
-[grunts] I'm like a full C.
-Mm-hmm.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.991
Grab! Flop 'em around!

13:04.074 --> 13:04.950
What's this?

13:05.576 --> 13:09.997
Nick is so lucky, breathing the same air
as those perfect tits.

13:10.080 --> 13:14.251
I can't believe he can just walk up
to those boobs and then say things.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.087
Just spitball,
but maybe we should study together.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.131
-Tomorrow after school?
-All right!

13:19.215 --> 13:21.050
Study hang sesh! Super duper.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.219
As long as you bring your butt batteries.

13:23.302 --> 13:26.180
[laughing] This is very...
I was not expecting this.

13:26.263 --> 13:29.642
I'd love to get a face full of milk
from those dairy cannons.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.185
-God, Jay.
-Come on, Jesse.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.187
-I never got to breast feed.
-How would you guys like it

13:33.270 --> 13:34.480
if girls looked at your dicks
all the time?

13:34.563 --> 13:36.565
That would be awesome.
Here's four of them.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.485
Don't worry. They're not fighting.
This is how they play.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.028
[chuckles[
Jesse, it's different.

13:41.111 --> 13:43.030
Penises are ugly, but boobs...

13:43.572 --> 13:45.533
-Boobs are beautiful. Big, round...
-Argh!

13:45.616 --> 13:46.909
-Yeah.
-Bounce, bounce,Â  bounce.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.745
-But why are guys so obsessed with them?
-Obsessed?

13:49.829 --> 13:52.248
We're interested. We appreciate breasts.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.583
-'Cause they're big and mushy.
-Big, warm and soft.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.211
And we want to stick our dicks
betwixt those tits.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.671
God, we really do, don't we?

13:58.754 --> 14:00.798
Remember when Lars had a seizure,

14:00.881 --> 14:04.218
and Summer DiLorenzo bent over
to see if he was okay?

14:04.301 --> 14:05.344
Like it was yesterday.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.263
[Hormone]
You could see right down her shirt...

14:07.346 --> 14:09.265
[Andrew]
All the way to heaven.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.350
[voice echos]
Heaven! Heaven!

14:12.393 --> 14:14.395
[gasps]

14:15.145 --> 14:15.980
My God.

14:16.063 --> 14:20.860
[Hormone]  Behold, the peaks and valleys
of the female breast, nature herself.

14:20.943 --> 14:24.071
-[Andrew gasps]
- Heaving with life, calling to you.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.490
A world unto their own.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.493
- The way they move two by two.
-[Andrew] Look at them.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.912
- Undulating.
-They're so majestic.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.330
Surrender to them.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.916
- Now feel how soft they are.
-[moans] Soft.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.836
- How they ache for your touch.
-I'm home.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.588
I'm home.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.632
-Andrew! What are you doing?
-[Andrew moaning]

14:43.716 --> 14:46.260
Yeah, what are you doing, you weirdo?

14:46.343 --> 14:49.346
What? No, I wasn't at home
in the field of the boobs.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.807
Ew, you guys are obsessed with boobs.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.935
This is exactly why Missy feels shitty
for not having them.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.229
-She does?
-Yeah, we all do.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.899
No! My backpack!

14:59.982 --> 15:01.400
-[Andrew grunts]
-Andrew, man!

15:01.692 --> 15:05.154
-My backpack!
-You can't touch his backpack.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.239
That's like his one rule!

15:07.323 --> 15:10.409
Oh, God! No one can tell I'm coming!

15:10.492 --> 15:12.369
They're actually very good guys.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.787
Kid beat the shit out of you.

15:13.871 --> 15:16.999
Jesse's right. I'm out of control.
What is it about these boobs?

15:17.082 --> 15:19.293
Behold, the peaks and valleys--

15:19.376 --> 15:22.338
No, stop painting pictures.
I feel like a pervert.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.049
So what? You like boobs. That's natural.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.217
-[grunts]
-[Andrew sighs]

15:27.343 --> 15:28.218
You see that?

15:28.344 --> 15:31.472
I don't want to make girls feel weird
about their bodies.

15:31.555 --> 15:32.598
Especially Missy.

15:32.681 --> 15:35.351
I honestly don't think
we can continue working together.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.728
I can't be horny
and still be a decent guy?

15:37.811 --> 15:40.898
Look, as his holiness,
the Dalai Lama once told me,

15:40.981 --> 15:44.109
you have enough blood to fill your heart
or your  shvantz.  Not both.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.780
How can these girls be our age?

15:47.863 --> 15:50.491
They're all so gorgeous. Must be nice.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.577
Look at that booty and those bazoombas!
Pow pow!

15:53.661 --> 15:57.539
Aw! And she misses her dog
'cause she's on vacation.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.376
Okay, I admit some of these girls
are kind of pretty,

16:00.459 --> 16:03.212
but my mom says
real beauty is on the inside.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.172
So is your colon,
and that's packed with crap.

16:05.255 --> 16:06.632
[sighs]
I don't know.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.842
Missy, the important thing is
we are smart

16:08.926 --> 16:11.762
-and we know who we are.
-You're a couple of ugly nerds!

16:11.845 --> 16:12.930
I wanna believe you, Jesse

16:13.013 --> 16:15.432
but, I don't think boys care
that we're smart.

16:15.516 --> 16:18.978
-[sighs] I know.
-I wanna be hot and dumb.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.187
-[door opens]
-Girls?

16:20.270 --> 16:22.564
I've been eavesdropping long enough,

16:22.648 --> 16:25.985
and hearing you bad mouth
your bodies is making me nuts.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.569
There's some place I want to take you.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.822
I don't wanna go to that
organic carrot farm. Argh!

16:29.905 --> 16:32.658
I was actually thinking of someplace else.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.159
-Mom!
-And before you ask,

16:34.243 --> 16:36.495
no, it's not the Macadamia sanctuary.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.581
I mean, she is funny. She's really pretty.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.543
-Is she smart? Does she know who she is?
-What?

16:42.626 --> 16:46.547
I don't know. It's the new ad campaign
for Ross Dress For Less.

16:46.630 --> 16:49.008
-She does want to study together.
-Hey, that's great!

16:49.091 --> 16:51.969
Finally, the rich white boy
catches a break! [laughs]

16:52.052 --> 16:54.388
Yeah, but now I don't know what to do.
I don't want to blow it , dude.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.724
Let me tell you a little Duke-y secret

16:56.807 --> 16:58.183
-when it comes to the ladies.
-Okay.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.060
-You ready for this, Nicolai?
-I guess.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.311
The secret is...

17:01.395 --> 17:03.355
[hums]

17:03.439 --> 17:05.899
-Listen.
-Listen? That's the big secret?

17:05.983 --> 17:09.153
When they speak,
listen to the words they say.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.989
And for extra credit, retain the details

17:12.072 --> 17:15.075
and drop them inÂ at a later date
to prove you were listening!

17:15.159 --> 17:17.828
-Oh!
-It's shockingly effective! Ha-ha!

17:17.911 --> 17:20.622
So I shouldn't just spout facts
so she knows I'm smart?

17:20.706 --> 17:21.707
Apparently not.

17:21.790 --> 17:25.419
It took me a lifetime
to realize that women, get this:

17:25.502 --> 17:27.921
Just want to be treated
like human beings.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.840
-[laughs]
-Human beings, huh?

17:29.923 --> 17:31.091
-Wow!
-I'll try that.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.968
âª Oh, listen to the ladiesÂ âª

17:33.052 --> 17:36.221
âª And you'll be rolling around
In a big field of tittiesÂ âª

17:36.305 --> 17:37.890
âª But don't trust the tittiesÂ âª

17:37.973 --> 17:41.268
âª The nipples are tiny camerasÂ âª

17:41.351 --> 17:42.853
DEEP QUEENS
SELF STORAGE

17:42.936 --> 17:46.523
Oh, I love you so much, Miss Whistle.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.860
You're always around my neck.
Even all the time.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.695
-[kisses]
-[whistle blows]

17:52.613 --> 17:55.157
Uh-oh. I bed wet thick again.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.950
That whistle have you thirsty?

17:57.034 --> 17:58.994
Hey, Rick, it's not weird that I haven't,

17:59.078 --> 18:01.622
you know, done sex yet, right?

18:01.705 --> 18:05.042
I blame myself.
I'm a bad hormone monster, man.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.961
-No, you're the man, Rick.
-No, you're the man, Steve!

18:08.045 --> 18:09.588
Wait, stop the clock.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.883
Is it possible
that neither of us is the man?

18:12.966 --> 18:14.176
Oh, man.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.970
No, man. You're the man.
Take a look around.

18:17.054 --> 18:21.350
I don't know. Maybe it's time
I sheet sneezed into a woman.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.269
Yeah, bring a lady back to your dope pad.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.563
-[bang]
-Holy pope!

18:26.647 --> 18:30.109
[Steve] Uh-oh, smells like they're
dropping us on the diaper barge again.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.737
-[Rick] What are you gonna do?
-Buster, I'm gonna smell those diapers.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.740
Mom, do we have to be naked?

18:36.824 --> 18:38.951
Well that's the whole point, sweetie.

18:39.034 --> 18:42.704
This is a Korean spa where all women can
feel comfortable in the nude.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.791
Still, I think I prefer to keep my robe--

18:45.874 --> 18:48.502
[exclaims] I was not ready for this.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.879
-And now I'm fine.
-You can't take off your robe.

18:50.963 --> 18:55.259
You look like a busted Smeagol,
you flat-chested beanpole ass bitch!

18:55.342 --> 18:58.762
Mom, I know I shouldn't care so much
and I'm really sorry to disappoint you,

18:58.846 --> 19:01.431
but I just don't want anyone to see
my weird body.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.892
-That's bull-honkey.
-Mom, language!

19:03.976 --> 19:06.603
I'm sorry, but your body is gorgeous.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.398
Just like all the women in here.
Look around.

19:09.648 --> 19:13.652
Wowsie woo! There sure are a lot
of bare naked ladies in here.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.696
Hot diggity damn.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.991
Look at this cornucopia of flesh.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.534
You see, girls?

19:20.617 --> 19:23.453
Being comfortable in your body
is beautiful.

19:23.537 --> 19:26.957
-[Hormone] Maybe she's right.
-Oh my goodness.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.417
Maybe...

19:28.750 --> 19:30.961
âª Every tushy is a snowflakeÂ âª

19:31.044 --> 19:32.754
âª Every nipple is a star âª

19:33.338 --> 19:35.340
âª Every curve and swerve is beautifulÂ âª

19:35.424 --> 19:37.843
âª Every stretch mark, every scarÂ âª

19:37.926 --> 19:40.429
âª We're smorgasbord of gorgeousnessÂ âª

19:40.512 --> 19:42.181
âª No two of us the sameÂ âª

19:42.681 --> 19:44.516
âª God made us in Her imageÂ âª

19:44.600 --> 19:48.395
âª And that girl ain't got no shameÂ âª

19:48.478 --> 19:50.439
âª I love my bodyÂ âª

19:50.522 --> 19:52.524
âª I love it all âª

19:52.608 --> 19:56.278
âª Every wrinkle, pimple, dimple
Big or smallÂ âª

19:57.070 --> 19:59.114
âª My booty is a beautyÂ âª

19:59.198 --> 20:01.116
âª My boobs a work of art âª

20:01.200 --> 20:03.035
âª My love handles my bat wingsÂ âªâª

20:03.118 --> 20:07.539
âª I love every single partÂ âª

20:09.499 --> 20:11.418
âª Cellulite and knobby knees âª

20:11.501 --> 20:13.503
âª Ittie-bitties and double D'sÂ âª

20:13.587 --> 20:15.339
âª Skinny legs and thunder thighsÂ âª

20:15.422 --> 20:17.549
âª Areolas of every shape and sizeÂ âª

20:17.633 --> 20:19.676
âª Innies, outies, easties, westies âª

20:19.760 --> 20:21.762
âª Parts I only show my besties âª

20:21.845 --> 20:23.847
âª Both big and tiny tushÂ âª

20:23.931 --> 20:27.142
âª Bikini wax and full on bushÂ âª

20:27.226 --> 20:29.186
âª We love our bodyÂ âª

20:29.269 --> 20:30.979
âª We want the world to knowÂ âª

20:31.063 --> 20:34.900
âª Every inch from frizzy hair
To crooked toe âª

20:35.442 --> 20:37.527
âª Every belly flat or roundÂ âª

20:37.611 --> 20:39.696
âª Every butthole bleached or brownÂ âª

20:40.072 --> 20:42.574
âª Tiny topless monkey junky funkyÂ âª

20:42.658 --> 20:44.326
âª Short and tallÂ âª

20:44.409 --> 20:47.454
âª We love it all âª

20:47.788 --> 20:50.165
[laughs]
That's laughable!

20:50.249 --> 20:53.001
Just because these women are
okay with their gross bodies,

20:53.085 --> 20:56.004
doesn't mean you get to be.
Get a grip, flat Stanley.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.923
You know what, Mirror Missy?

20:58.048 --> 21:01.385
Why don't you just go fudge yourself!
You fudging...

21:01.468 --> 21:03.178
[pants]

21:03.262 --> 21:04.263
Cunt!

21:04.346 --> 21:07.015
[gasps]  Mamma mia!

21:07.307 --> 21:09.768
[muffled voice]
I'm melting!

21:11.853 --> 21:13.480
âª We love it allÂ âª

21:14.898 --> 21:16.275
[Dina] Jesse, is that you?

21:16.358 --> 21:18.568
-Cantor Dina?
-I love that you're here.

21:18.652 --> 21:21.905
Good gravy! Her body is insane!

21:21.989 --> 21:24.616
It's like the universe
just bringing us together, you know?

21:24.700 --> 21:27.703
No wonder your mama was worried
about getting short-necked.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.579
We should get your mom to come.

21:29.663 --> 21:32.165
The three of us can have a girl's day.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.501
-Fun.
-That body make a girl gay.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.420
In fact, it did, right?

21:36.545 --> 21:39.006
We get it, Dina, you look good naked.
Congrats.

21:39.089 --> 21:40.007
Jesse...

21:40.632 --> 21:41.967
Wow! Thank you.
[chuckles]

21:42.050 --> 21:44.970
It's really a combination
of meditation, soul cycle...

21:45.053 --> 21:47.139
-I wasn't trying to be nice.
-Eating carob--

21:47.222 --> 21:49.308
I don't wanna be friends with you.

21:49.391 --> 21:52.561
-Oh, okay.
-I just want you to leave me alone.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.981
Wow! Why I do all my girlfriends'
daughters hate me? Oh well.

21:56.064 --> 21:59.276
Hey, Mom? I just want to say,
thanks for not getting tempted by a vixen.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.946
[sighs] It's so much easier
to study in the library.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.364
My place is so crazy.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.533
'Cause of your two brothers
who like 90's basketball?

22:06.616 --> 22:08.368
-Good memory.
-I listened.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.661
-You listen.
-Yeah.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.538
She smells good. Bite her hand.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.957
-What's this? Hey.
-Is it a treat?

22:14.041 --> 22:15.375
A treat for me?

22:16.835 --> 22:17.794
[cell phone vibrates]

22:17.878 --> 22:18.712
-Ah!
-What?

22:18.795 --> 22:20.547
-Nothing.
-What do you mean, nothing? Tell me.

22:20.630 --> 22:21.757
-Can you keep a secret?
-I don't know.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.717
-Promise?
-I promise I'll keep it a secret.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.635
I haven't told anyone
about Andrew's milk baths.

22:25.719 --> 22:26.762
He has them for his eczema.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.555
I shouldn't have just said that.
Just tell me the secret.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.308
Okay. I guess, like,

22:31.391 --> 22:33.643
-DeVon and Devin broke up.
-Really?

22:33.727 --> 22:37.773
And I guess it's because
DeVon maybe likes me now?

22:37.856 --> 22:38.732
-Huh.
-Yeah.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.734
How does it make you feel?

22:40.817 --> 22:41.902
-Excited.
-Really?

22:41.985 --> 22:44.154
Yeah, I mean, 'cause it's DeVon.
I mean, come on. [chuckles]

22:44.237 --> 22:45.989
-Yeah.
-I always kind of liked him.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.241
I guess so. I mean, I get it.
You know, he's DeVon.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.160
-He's cool. He's funny. He's...
-Yeah.

22:50.243 --> 22:51.536
-...totally black.
-What?

22:51.620 --> 22:52.746
-What?
-Say it louder.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.831
She didn't hear your race comment.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.667
I said, "That's great."
I'm really happy for you.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.878
Yeah, although it is kind of weird,

22:59.961 --> 23:01.546
'cause he never
really talked to me before.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.131
-That is weird, isn't it?
-Yeah.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.802
It makes you think a little bit, right?
Like what are his intentions, right?

23:06.885 --> 23:10.680
-Sorry, where were we?
-You were talking about DeVon being black,

23:10.764 --> 23:13.141
and you were saying it to a Latin girl.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.560
-Ah, great recap.
-Hey, you gotta listen.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.647
[girls giggling]

23:18.730 --> 23:20.816
Missy? What are you doing?

23:20.899 --> 23:24.361
What? It's just a body, you guys,
and I am owning it.

23:24.444 --> 23:28.490
Yeah. Being comfortable in your body
makes you beautiful they say.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.450
-Sing it!
-Oh my God.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.202
Did your moms tell you that?

23:32.285 --> 23:35.539
I bet they're on that website,
Ugly Girls are Pretty Too.

23:35.622 --> 23:38.708
-But they aren't, are they, Lola?
-No, they're not.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.710
Missy, I think we need to remember

23:40.794 --> 23:43.797
that not everyone went to the Korean spa.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.757
I wanna be really body positive.
It's just that--

23:45.841 --> 23:48.510
-I see what you're saying.
-Yeah, I'm kind of directly saying,

23:48.593 --> 23:50.053
-like, put your clothes on.
-You want me to put my shirt on.

23:50.137 --> 23:53.098
Yeah.
I really am not comfortable with subtext.

23:53.181 --> 23:54.224
[door opens]

23:54.307 --> 23:55.517
-Hi, Missy.
-Hey, Andrew.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.103
I just want to apologize
if I made you feel weird.

23:58.186 --> 23:59.187
Oh! Uh...

23:59.271 --> 24:01.314
I have literally no idea
what you're talking about.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.483
-Our bodies, they're changing.
-Right.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.819
And if the way boys look at girls
makes you uncomfortable,

24:05.902 --> 24:08.196
-then I'm sorry.
-Well, that's very sweet--

24:08.280 --> 24:10.490
'Cause I'm just trying
to be a good guy, Missy.

24:10.574 --> 24:11.825
-But it's hard.
-Oh, okay, well--

24:11.908 --> 24:14.536
It's hard in today's world.
Everyone's on their screens

24:14.619 --> 24:17.789
and everything's moving a mile a minute.
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

24:17.873 --> 24:19.583
if neither of us is married
in three years,

24:19.666 --> 24:22.085
-should we just get hitched?
-Um...

24:22.627 --> 24:25.088
-I...
-I'll take that as a soft no.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.715
I think,Â Gena likes DeVon.

24:26.798 --> 24:29.009
I think I just proposed to Missy.

24:29.092 --> 24:32.471
I think I've cheesed my jeans
11 times today,

24:32.554 --> 24:35.599
but I'm going for a record 13.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.267

24:38.935 --> 24:40.187
[rock music playing]

24:40.312 --> 24:41.730
-Hey, Jess.
-What?

24:41.813 --> 24:43.440
-Please take off your headphones.
-Argh!

24:43.523 --> 24:45.817
I heard that you saw Dina
at the Korean spa.

24:45.901 --> 24:46.902
Yeah, I did.

24:46.985 --> 24:49.988
I guess, we've both seen her naked now?
So, that's awesome.

24:50.071 --> 24:51.948
-Jesse...
-What? She's got a great body.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.783
It's way better than yours.

24:53.867 --> 24:57.287
-Oh! That's a really bitchy thing to say.
-Oh, is it?

24:57.370 --> 24:58.705
-'Cause you're so wonderful?
-Honey!

24:58.788 --> 25:02.250
You had an affair and then forced dad
to live in the basement.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.336
Okay, Jesse.
What exactly do you want from me?

25:04.419 --> 25:06.880
I want you to be a grown up
and tell me what's going to happen!

25:06.963 --> 25:09.257
-I don't know what's going to happen.
-Oh my God.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.134
-I don't know!
-You're the one crying?

25:11.218 --> 25:12.177
-Stop it.
-Please.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.012
Stop being so mean to me.

25:14.095 --> 25:16.389
Well, then stop fucking up my life,
you short-neck bitch!

25:16.473 --> 25:18.934
-[gasps] Go to your room!
-I'm already in my room!

25:19.017 --> 25:20.936
-You go to your room!
-Fine!

25:21.019 --> 25:22.896
-Fine!
-[door closes]

25:23.021 --> 25:25.774
That was beautiful. No notes!
