00:02.502 --> 00:04.104
( bell rings )

00:04.137 --> 00:06.673
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.705 --> 00:09.576
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.609 --> 00:12.479
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.512 --> 00:16.082
<i>* I'm at the corner</i>
<i>just in time</i>
<i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.116 --> 00:21.621
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.654 --> 00:24.758
<i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
<i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.791 --> 00:27.727
<i>* And my dog ate</i>
<i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.761 --> 00:30.630
<i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
<i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.663 --> 00:34.234
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>

00:34.267 --> 00:38.772
<i>* It's all right</i>

00:52.552 --> 00:55.655
<i>* It's all right</i>

00:55.689 --> 00:58.558
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:58.591 --> 01:02.095
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:16.409 --> 01:19.212
Zack:
<i>What a week this</i>
<i>is going to be.</i>

01:19.245 --> 01:21.514
<i>Jesse's dad is</i>
<i>getting married.</i>

01:21.548 --> 01:24.551
<i>He's a manager</i>
<i>of this luxury</i>
<i>hotel in Palm Desert,</i>

01:24.584 --> 01:27.320
<i>and he's</i>
<i>invited the whole gang</i>
<i>down for the wedding!</i>

01:27.354 --> 01:30.523
<i>Maybe I'll get</i>
<i>lucky and they'll</i>
<i>throw me to the single girls,</i>

01:30.557 --> 01:32.492
<i>instead of the bouquet!</i>

01:43.670 --> 01:45.772
Jessie told us this hotel
was beautiful,

01:45.805 --> 01:47.574
but I never expected this!

01:47.607 --> 01:49.776
Health spa, golf course,
swimming pool...

01:49.809 --> 01:53.513
her father is
the manager of heaven!

01:53.546 --> 01:57.517
Yeah, and all
these beautiful angels
around here to prove it.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.454
- What's up, Jess?
- Okay,
guys, we're all checked in.

02:01.488 --> 02:04.591
My dad left a note.
He and his fiancee
will meet us for dinner.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.393
I can't wait to meet her!

02:06.426 --> 02:08.627
I can't believe your dad
is getting remarried

02:08.661 --> 02:10.630
and you've never
even met the chick!

02:10.663 --> 02:12.465
I mean babe.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.501
I mean...
help me out here, Preppie!

02:14.534 --> 02:16.336
- Woman.
- That's it.

02:16.369 --> 02:18.538
The reason is because
it happened so fast.

02:18.571 --> 02:22.175
They met here, fell in love,
now they're getting married.

02:22.208 --> 02:25.111
That's the most romantic story
I've ever heard.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.614
Let's get away from leaky eyes
and check this place out.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.582
Love struck once,
it could happen again.

02:29.616 --> 02:32.752
I can see how it'd be easy
to fall in love here.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.354
Woman: Hi.

02:34.387 --> 02:37.757
Hey, I am in love now!

02:37.791 --> 02:40.660
Zack,
if you're going to drool,
do it over the fountain.

02:40.694 --> 02:43.229
She's just some
aerobics bimbo.

02:43.263 --> 02:46.766
If brains were dynamite,
she wouldn't
have enough to blow her nose.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.103
That's a good point,
but remember,
airheads are people too.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.105
And they make great dates.

02:52.138 --> 02:54.574
Let's check out those hard
bodies at the health spa.

02:54.607 --> 02:58.111
I'm with you dudes.
I want to try out my new book.

02:58.111 --> 03:00.513
''Everything You Need
to Know About Girls''?

03:00.547 --> 03:04.284
Yep. Jessie's dad may not be
the only one getting some
action around here.

03:19.399 --> 03:21.568
Whoa, this is serious.

03:21.601 --> 03:24.738
Gentlemen,
we have struck gold!

03:24.771 --> 03:26.606
Let's work out.

03:26.639 --> 03:30.210
I don't know about you,
but working out
is the last thing on my mind.

03:30.243 --> 03:34.080
- I hear you, blood.
- ''I hear you, blood''?

03:34.080 --> 03:35.815
Where did you get that?

03:36.750 --> 03:39.452
Chapter 3,
Talking Cool.

03:39.486 --> 03:42.322
Is there a chapter
on shutting up?

03:42.355 --> 03:44.624
Let's go, Screech.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.733
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:53.767 --> 03:58.104
I saw you in
the lobby and I must say
you are in great shape.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.540
Well, I eat right,
I get plenty of sleep,

04:00.573 --> 04:03.309
and I teach six aerobics
classes a day.

04:03.343 --> 04:06.079
Oh... low impact or high?

04:06.112 --> 04:09.582
- You know aerobics?
- Yeah, you know,
I don't want to brag,

04:09.616 --> 04:12.752
but I'm the captain
of our school's aerobics team.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.755
Oh really?
Maybe you'd like
to join my class?

04:15.789 --> 04:18.324
Well, how about
a private workout?

04:18.358 --> 04:21.094
No thanks, I've got
a pretty full schedule.

04:21.127 --> 04:23.563
So do l, but I can always
make room for you.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.766
If you're going
to join my class,
why don't we start warming up?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.502
Okay.
What do you suggest?

04:29.536 --> 04:32.772
Why don't you give
this one a try?

04:32.806 --> 04:35.742
One and two.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.544
Oh... oh, yeah.

04:37.577 --> 04:40.714
Beautiful.
No problem.

04:40.747 --> 04:42.716
Here we go.
( groans )

04:42.749 --> 04:47.187
I'm just... you know...
warming up.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.593
I'll see you in class.

05:04.337 --> 05:07.040
Hi, is this boat taken?

05:07.073 --> 05:09.442
( European accent )
I don't think so.

05:13.380 --> 05:16.049
I like it when the water's
calm like this.

05:16.082 --> 05:17.717
( giggles )

05:17.751 --> 05:21.321
You might be wondering
my name... it's AC Slater,

05:21.354 --> 05:22.722
from LA.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.724
I'm Christina.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.659
That is a beautiful accent.

05:26.693 --> 05:29.195
Let me guess.
You're not from California.

05:29.229 --> 05:32.165
No, I'm not.
I'm from Europe.

05:32.198 --> 05:33.767
Oh?

05:34.734 --> 05:36.469
Well, it was nice meeting you.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.438
Hey,
maybe I'll see you around.

05:38.471 --> 05:40.573
Maybe.

05:47.113 --> 05:50.550
"Say, foxy lady,
want to run away with me?"

05:50.583 --> 05:53.186
Run away with yourself,
you geek!

05:53.219 --> 05:54.788
( beeps )

06:07.067 --> 06:09.536
How's my hair?
Maybe I should
have worn it up.

06:09.569 --> 06:12.038
- It's beautiful.
- What about my make-up?

06:12.038 --> 06:14.574
- I didn't overdo it, did I?
- It's great, Jessie.

06:14.607 --> 06:17.243
- And my dress, is it...
- Jessie, you look fine.

06:17.277 --> 06:20.613
We're having dinner
with your dad, not Mel Gibson.

06:20.647 --> 06:24.117
I'm sorry. I'm going to meet
my future stepmom.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.453
It's important I make
the right impression.

06:26.486 --> 06:29.155
What are these beautiful
women doing in my hotel?

06:29.189 --> 06:31.691
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hi, sweetheart.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.127
Kelly, Lisa,
it's nice to see you.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.496
Oh Jessie,
you look beautiful.

06:36.529 --> 06:40.600
Everything about you...
your hair,
your make-up, your dress.

06:40.633 --> 06:43.136
You look so grown up.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.205
Thank you.
What about you, Daddy?

06:45.238 --> 06:48.708
You look so young.
Not that you're
old or anything.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.345
Leslie makes me feel young.

06:52.379 --> 06:55.248
You are going
to love her, Jessie.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.150
I can't wait to meet her.
Where is she?

06:57.183 --> 06:59.219
She should be here any minute.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.321
- Why don't we sit
down while we wait?
- This way?

07:01.354 --> 07:04.691
Come on over here.
I've arranged
a nice little table for us.

07:04.724 --> 07:07.594
- I think
you'll appreciate it.
- I'll sit next to you.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.095
- Here we are.
- This is nice.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.031
- Isn't this lovely?
- Thank you.

07:18.471 --> 07:21.141
- So, how are you
enjoying the hotel?
- It's wonderful.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.076
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.644
If you need someone
to keep an eye on the place

07:24.678 --> 07:27.714
while on your honeymoon,
I'm available.

07:27.747 --> 07:29.582
I'll remember that, Lisa.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.551
- Hey!
- Hi, guys!

07:34.621 --> 07:38.391
- What happened to you, Zack?
- Nothing
a Jacuzzi won't cure.

07:38.425 --> 07:42.595
He tried to impress some chick
by straining every
muscle in his body.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.165
How are you doing
with the ladies, Screech?

07:45.198 --> 07:48.535
I've met a few babes,
but I'm still waiting for Ms.
Right.

07:48.568 --> 07:51.738
You'll be waiting
for a long time.

07:51.771 --> 07:56.343
Lisa, with this book,
even you would be
putty in my hands.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.244
For instance...

08:00.313 --> 08:03.216
"You know, love kitten.
I don't need to
see the specials.

08:03.249 --> 08:06.019
"You're the catch of the day!"

08:06.019 --> 08:08.355
That's good.
May I see that, please?

08:08.388 --> 08:11.257
- Sure.
- Catch this.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.430
Don't look now,
but your airhead just blew in.

08:17.464 --> 08:20.633
- I knew she
couldn't resist me.
- Hi, David.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.768
Hi, Leslie.

08:21.801 --> 08:25.438
Kids, I would like you to meet
the future Mrs. Spano.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.543
Oh my gosh!
I hit on your mother!

08:30.577 --> 08:35.048
You think that's bad?
Jessie's dad is marrying
the aerobics bimbo!

08:52.499 --> 08:54.300
Would you calm down?

08:54.334 --> 08:56.269
Leslie is a nice lady.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.405
No, Zack, she's a nice girl!

08:58.438 --> 09:01.007
I can't believe my dad
is going to marry her.

09:01.007 --> 09:04.044
I can't believe I
tried to pick up
on your stepmom!

09:04.077 --> 09:06.012
I'm so embarrassed.

09:06.012 --> 09:09.382
I'm embarrassed my dad
is robbing the cradle!

09:09.416 --> 09:12.252
There you are, Jessie.
Why did you run off so fast?

09:12.285 --> 09:14.154
You left before
I got the chance

09:14.187 --> 09:16.489
to ask you to be
my maid of honor on Sunday.

09:16.523 --> 09:19.826
Wow! Maid of honor...
what an honor!

09:19.859 --> 09:23.029
- Gee, Leslie, I don't know.
- What's your problem?

09:23.063 --> 09:26.399
You get to stand up in front
of a crowd in
a beautiful gown.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.268
I really can't.

09:28.301 --> 09:31.371
- I don't have a gown.
- I've already
got one for you!

09:31.404 --> 09:34.574
Just come by your dad's suite
tomorrow
morning for a fitting.

09:34.607 --> 09:37.143
We are going to have
so much fun!

09:37.177 --> 09:40.080
Since we're here, why don't we
take a boat out to the point

09:40.113 --> 09:42.282
and see where
we're getting married?

09:42.315 --> 09:44.384
Come on, let's go!

09:45.251 --> 09:48.054
Sorry, I'm gonna
have to bail.

09:48.054 --> 09:51.124
- Is something wrong, honey?
- He doesn't want to know.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.227
I have a really bad headache.

09:54.260 --> 09:58.298
- Can I get you something?
- No. I just need to lie down.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.233
See you later, Daddy.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.936
- Bye... everybody.
- Bye.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.841
Okay, give us the dirt.
When did
the sparks start flying?

10:07.874 --> 10:10.377
Six months ago, David hired me
to run the health spa.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.380
Pretty soon, I was taking
three aerobics classes a day.

10:13.413 --> 10:17.183
He told me his doctor said
he needed to
get more exercise.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.452
- And she bought it.
- Doctor's orders?

10:19.486 --> 10:22.455
- Pretty smooth there, Mr. S.
- How did you
finally get together?

10:22.489 --> 10:25.058
I told her my
doctor ordered me
to take her to dinner.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.227
You've got a great doctor!

10:28.661 --> 10:30.497
Both: Aw!

10:30.530 --> 10:33.533
- A sunset boat
ride sounds wonderful.
- You bet it is.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.870
That's where David kissed me
for the first time.

10:36.903 --> 10:39.339
Sort of a miniature Love Boat.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.208
Zack, you are so cute.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.429
- Hey, Christina.
- AC.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.831
- How was the boat ride?
- It was okay.

11:04.864 --> 11:07.367
Just okay? That's because
you went without me.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.302
Would you care
to take another lap?

11:09.336 --> 11:11.971
You are a charmer.

11:14.374 --> 11:17.310
Hold the boat!
Hold the boat!

11:17.344 --> 11:20.080
Why are you dressed
like that, dork?

11:20.080 --> 11:25.251
Sophisticated gentlemen
dress suitably for every
occasion, my darling.

11:25.285 --> 11:28.488
Lisa, you wouldn't have
any seasick pills, would you?

11:28.521 --> 11:31.391
You ninny, it's only
three feet of water!

11:31.424 --> 11:34.094
So what?
I get seasick in the bathtub.

12:12.065 --> 12:16.269
You know, this is where
David asked me to marry him.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.472
- Well?
- Well what?

12:19.506 --> 12:22.409
- What did you say?
- We're here for the wedding.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.311
- What do you think she said?
- Oh my gosh!

12:25.345 --> 12:28.081
Congratulations, Mr. Spano!

12:28.081 --> 12:32.085
It's amazing. He just keeps
getting worse every year.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.155
Over there is the point.
That's where
the wedding reception will be.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.523
- Screech: Pointy.
- And after that,

12:36.556 --> 12:39.125
we leave for our honeymoon
in New York.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.462
It's getting late, and I have
a long day tomorrow.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.932
And I have an aerobics
class at 6:00 a.m.!

12:45.965 --> 12:48.001
- You're gonna be there, Zack?
- Oh sure.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.170
If I'm not on time,
you can start without me.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.205
- Right!
- Good night, everybody.

12:52.238 --> 12:55.608
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Have a nice night.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.644
It's gorgeous out here,
isn't it?

12:57.677 --> 13:01.047
You know, Zack, I kissed Lisa
for the first
time on a bridge.

13:01.047 --> 13:04.117
- Oh yeah? When was that?
- Right before
I threw him off.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.319
I still have the rock
that I hit my head on.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.521
Ah, memories...

13:13.326 --> 13:16.429
- You have wonderful friends.
- Yeah, they are great.

13:16.463 --> 13:20.066
But I already know about them.
I want to know about you.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.069
- What do you want to know?
- Just little stuff,

13:23.069 --> 13:26.606
like how old you are, what's
your last name,
where do you live...

13:26.639 --> 13:29.275
do you have a boyfriend?

13:29.309 --> 13:33.179
17; von Hoffman;
Lichtenburg; no.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.216
Yes!
It's a good start.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.085
Now, is there anything else
l need to know?

13:39.085 --> 13:41.554
Yes. I am a princess.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.190
That's cool. So is Lisa.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.327
No, I mean, a real princess.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.629
Yeah right,
and I'm Michael Jordan!

13:49.662 --> 13:52.098
Come on,
who are you, really?

13:52.098 --> 13:53.967
I'll tell you at another time.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.469
Why don't we
play golf tomorrow.
Do you play?

13:56.503 --> 13:59.639
Do I play golf?
What, are you kidding?

14:01.541 --> 14:03.376
Four!

14:05.178 --> 14:07.914
You're really sore, huh?

14:07.947 --> 14:10.050
Kelly, even my socks hurt!

14:10.050 --> 14:12.952
Poor baby.
Let me rub those shoulders.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.854
Mmmm. Thank you.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.257
Oh, thank you!

14:20.060 --> 14:23.530
You know, this is exactly
where I want to get married.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.865
You still want to get
married to Tom Cruise?

14:25.899 --> 14:28.335
- Nah, hated his last movie.
- Oh, I know what you mean.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.171
That's why I broke it off
with Kim Basinger.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.073
I guess I'm old fashioned.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.075
I don't need a movie star.

14:35.075 --> 14:38.111
Just someone who's nice
and who'll treat
me like a lady.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.313
You won't have any trouble
finding a guy.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.082
Oh.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.318
It's getting cold.

14:45.352 --> 14:48.288
Here, take my jacket.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.393
How's that?

14:53.426 --> 14:56.262
You know,
you're still a gentleman.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.099
Just like when we were
going together.

15:02.268 --> 15:04.871
Say, Lisa, it's getting
a wee bit nippy out.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.574
- Care to borrow my jacket?
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.910
I insist.
According to page 36,

15:10.944 --> 15:14.481
"On a cool night, a gentleman
always offers his
jacket to a lady."

15:16.182 --> 15:18.284
Here.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.301
- Hi, guys.
- Hey,
I thought you had a headache.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.303
Oh... it went away.

15:37.337 --> 15:40.073
- Have you seen my father?
- Yeah,
he crashed for the night.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.942
- I need to talk
to him about Leslie.
- Isn't she sweet?

15:42.976 --> 15:44.244
What a great stepmom to have!

15:44.277 --> 15:45.945
Yeah. She's pretty,
she's cool.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.914
She has a terrific
fashion sense.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.283
I don't know
what he sees in her.

15:50.316 --> 15:53.086
Are you crazy?
The same thing I did...
she's hot!

15:53.086 --> 15:55.522
I think he'd be better off
with someone his own age.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.458
What difference does age make?
It's the person that counts.

15:58.491 --> 16:02.228
- And Leslie's terrific!
- Besides, she loves your dad.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.130
She's nothing like my mom.

16:04.164 --> 16:07.467
Good thing too.
He divorced her!

16:07.500 --> 16:10.870
Trust me,
Jessie, she's a great lady.
Give her a chance!

16:10.904 --> 16:13.440
Whose side
are you guys on anyway?

16:13.473 --> 16:16.242
Excuse me.
My headache's back.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.214
Hey, hey...

16:23.583 --> 16:26.386
- ( dings )
- There you go.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.903
Man, you're really good.

16:43.937 --> 16:46.906
That's what happens when
you have a golf course
in your backyard.

16:46.940 --> 16:50.577
Yeah right. I suppose
they're just
next to the stables.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.179
Actually no.
The stables are
down by the lake.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.782
Go on, get out of here!

16:57.083 --> 16:58.284
There we go.

16:58.318 --> 17:01.321
Now, Kelly,
keep your head down.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.189
All right, and your eye
on the ball.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.723
Just follow through.

17:04.758 --> 17:07.327
Smooth, easy.
Ready?

17:11.865 --> 17:14.300
- I made it!
- All right,
we still make a good team!

17:14.334 --> 17:16.869
All right!

17:19.239 --> 17:22.108
Could you show me
that shot again, Christina?

17:30.817 --> 17:33.586
Terrific, <i>chaton.</i>

17:33.620 --> 17:37.057
Father, hello.

17:37.090 --> 17:41.227
AC, I'd like you
to meet my father,
the king of Lichtenburg.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.064
You mean, he's the...

17:44.064 --> 17:47.233
then that means you're...
oh boy!

17:47.267 --> 17:48.335
Hi!

17:48.368 --> 17:51.571
Be with you in a second.

17:51.604 --> 17:55.175
Christina,
you weren't kidding!
You really are a princess!

17:55.208 --> 17:57.310
- Does it matter?
- Well, yeah!

17:57.344 --> 17:59.813
I mean, no.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.848
I'm glad. It usually
scares guys off.

18:01.881 --> 18:06.286
- That's why I
didn't tell you at first.
- Is everything okay?

18:06.319 --> 18:08.722
- Everything's great.
- Oh yeah,

18:08.755 --> 18:10.924
great, Your Highnesship!

18:11.024 --> 18:13.893
- Is that what you call him?
- No, I call him father.

18:13.927 --> 18:17.697
So, can you give my daughter
any competition?

18:17.731 --> 18:19.899
She is tough to beat.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.736
She putts around
the palace all day.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.939
I bet that moat's
a real water hazard!

18:26.740 --> 18:30.076
- AC, don't be nervous.
- Me?

18:30.110 --> 18:33.646
I'm not nervous.
Excuse me.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.582
Watch this.

18:53.199 --> 18:56.069
Kelly:
I'm gonna drown you!

18:56.102 --> 18:58.138
Okay. Get away.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.040
- Want the ball?
- Okay.

19:00.073 --> 19:03.243
- Go get it.
- Way over there!

19:06.012 --> 19:07.781
- Hey.
- Hey, dude.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.849
- What are you doing?
- Just bagging some rays.

19:09.883 --> 19:13.119
My book says chicks dig
a guy with a savage tan.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.722
Get rid of the book.
Only an idiot would
believe that stuff.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.724
<i>Au contraire,</i> my blond friend,

19:17.757 --> 19:20.126
this book
predicted you and Kelly
would get back together.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.129
- Screech, you're crazy.
- Huh-uh.

19:23.163 --> 19:26.666
"First,
the lady gives the gentleman
a moonlight massage."

19:26.700 --> 19:28.868
- My shoulders hurt.
- Okay.

19:28.902 --> 19:31.805
"Second, the gentleman
offers his
jacket to the lady."

19:31.838 --> 19:32.772
She was cold.

19:32.806 --> 19:34.607
"Third, the lady buys
the gentleman a drink."

19:34.641 --> 19:36.543
There you go.
Never happened.

19:36.576 --> 19:40.046
Hey, Zack, I bought us
a couple of sodas.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.587
And she's not
just a regular chick.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.157
She's a princess.
And she lives in a castle.

19:51.191 --> 19:54.060
She must have
huge closets.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.062
Lisa, I'm serious.

19:56.062 --> 19:59.065
Why would she like me?
I'm a nobody compared to her.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.968
Honey, first, you've got
to stop thinking like a frog

20:02.002 --> 20:04.838
and start acting
like Prince Charming.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.140
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Thanks, Lisa.

20:07.173 --> 20:11.144
No problem. Find out
if she has any
single brothers.

20:14.114 --> 20:15.949
I brought
some chocolate kisses.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.318
Your favorite.

20:18.351 --> 20:21.121
- Isn't she great, Jessie?
- Oh yeah, a blast.

20:21.154 --> 20:24.724
Better hop in this pool fast.
I don't want to lose you
to a younger guy.

20:24.758 --> 20:27.027
You have nothing
to worry about.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.196
I think older men
are very sexy.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.868
Isn't this great?
My two girls.

20:34.901 --> 20:38.271
( chuckles )
Yeah, one big happy family.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.809
Here we go!
I almost dropped you.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.011
Here's a towel.

20:45.045 --> 20:47.714
- There you go.
- Thank you.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.050
It's getting cold.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.252
I know.

21:04.264 --> 21:07.067
Did we... just kiss?

21:07.067 --> 21:09.302
That's what it
felt like to me.

21:09.336 --> 21:13.773
- Kelly, I didn't plan...
- I know. Me neither.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.683
I'd better go.
See ya.

21:25.852 --> 21:29.122
- I like this place.
- Well, I hate it!

21:29.155 --> 21:31.091
I guess it didn't go too well
with your father, huh?

21:31.091 --> 21:34.994
Nope. It's obvious that
he's very much in
love with Leslie.

21:35.095 --> 21:37.964
It's just a shame I'm going
to have to stop the wedding.
