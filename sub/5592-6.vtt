Then we must work quickly.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.685
How do we stop the explosion?

01:25.800 --> 01:28.565
Well, based on the size and the
trajectory of the explosions,

01:28.640 --> 01:31.246
there were at least six
separate bombs, maybe more,

01:31.360 --> 01:34.364
all detonated simultaneously
and we have to find them.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.764
And what time was the explosion?

01:37.000 --> 01:40.482
11:14, which means all
these people are gonna die.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.204
Maybe we don't find the bombs.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.362
Maybe we call in a bomb
threat and warn them.

01:49.440 --> 01:52.728
No, I told you. We must try
not to step on butterflies.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.649

She's here?

02:18.560 --> 02:21.450

What is it you couldn't tell
me on the phone, Angela?

03:03.680 --> 03:05.205
We have made a terrible mistake

03:05.280 --> 03:07.806
getting into bed with Erica
Kravid and Renautas.

03:07.880 --> 03:11.407
Maybe you have. Renautas has been
funding my research for four years.

03:11.480 --> 03:12.891
Something Primatech never did.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.964

up there in the Arctic.

This is classified!

03:39.160 --> 03:40.321
Where did you get this?

03:40.400 --> 03:43.244
I've gone to great lengths to make
Erica believe we're still partners,

03:43.320 --> 03:44.685
but I am telling you...

03:45.640 --> 03:47.642
Her plan, such as it is,

03:48.600 --> 03:50.807
is to let the HELE come.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.327
That's absurd.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.240
She hired me to find a
solution and I did.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.402
It's the Evos...

03:58.480 --> 04:00.403
Otherwise, everyone
on the planet would die.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.891
Not everyone.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.247
And Erica will choose
who survives.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.527
She's been
planning it for years.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.403
You're telling me that she knew
all this before she hired me?

04:10.520 --> 04:12.682
Yes, because I told her!

04:12.920 --> 04:15.491
I had one of my visions.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.844

visions always come true.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.881
<i>the Evos who can save us.</i>

04:52.160 --> 04:53.650
And you told her that, too.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.804
I thought if I did,

04:55.880 --> 04:58.884
we could revise the plan and
save everyone, but she...

05:01.360 --> 05:04.409
She used me, Mohinder.
You have to believe me.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.606

escorted out and shot.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.409
Oh, like <i>Harry Potter.</i>

14:49.640 --> 14:50.687
Give us a moment.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.481
Shh.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.925
You touched base with Claire?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.162
NOAH: Why did you go behind my
back and rearrange security?

14:57.240 --> 14:58.890
Noah, you're over thinking.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.731
You left half
the building unguarded.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.007
I ran a dozen scenarios.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.286
I covered every entry point.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.044
Have you even read my briefing?

15:07.120 --> 15:08.087
We're covered.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.128
Our security is
the best there is.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.921
Stop worrying and enjoy this.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.170
You should be out there
celebrating with your daughter,

15:16.240 --> 15:18.368
who I look forward to meeting.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.564
You seem very interested
in my daughter.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.650
Well, she is the one who
started this whole thing

15:25.720 --> 15:27.688
when she jumped off that
Ferris wheel in New York.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.850
Humanity has taken a
backseat to Evos ever since.

15:30.920 --> 15:34.766
Evos are humanity, Erica. That's the
whole point of this summit, isn't it?

15:34.840 --> 15:38.731
To remind us that evolved
humans are still human.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.569
Evolution is great
when it's controlled.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.526
Random evolution, not so much.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.364
I thought you of all people
would understand that.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.727
Living with one of them under
your own roof for so many years.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.083
You sound like a bigot, Erica.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.010
I'm a businesswoman
and a pragmatist.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.168
Renautas has plans, big plans

16:05.240 --> 16:07.447
that are going
to change the world.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.165
Bis plans, huh?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.490
I want you by my side

16:14.080 --> 16:15.491
because you're smart.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.767
So I'm gonna pull you
off the field for a beat,

16:17.840 --> 16:18.966
put you on the bench.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.366
The bench?

16:20.440 --> 16:21.521
Yes.

16:24.080 --> 16:28.404
Please escort Mr. Bennet downstairs,
where I think he'll be more comfortable.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.889
Oh, you've gotta
be kidding. Ow!

16:31.960 --> 16:33.041
(THUDDING)

16:44.880 --> 16:45.927
Don't worry.

16:47.720 --> 16:48.960
When I see Claire,

16:49.720 --> 16:51.484
I'll tell her
you've been detained.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.368
You'll never get
your hands on her.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.762
Noah, don't! You are
not thinking clearly.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.483
We don't know
what happens to him, me.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.800
The other Noah will be fine.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.769
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be here, right?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.242
Oh, Noah, thank God.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.204
- Angela?
- It's Claire.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.527
What? Where, where is she?

17:19.640 --> 17:22.325
A nurse from St. Jude's Hospital called.
She had Claire's phone and...

17:22.400 --> 17:24.050
And what? Is she alive?

17:24.119 --> 17:26.726
All they'd tell me is that she
was rushed from here to the ER.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.131
She's in surgery.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.644
This time, you save the cheerleader.
I will stop the bomb.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.604
I'm looking for my
daughter, Claire Bennet.

17:48.280 --> 17:49.486
Mr. Bennet.

17:50.640 --> 17:51.926
Please tell me
we got here in time.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.923
What's happened?
Where is she?

17:55.880 --> 17:58.565
I'm sorry. We tried
everything that we could.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.289
We were able to
save the children.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.126
Children?

18:25.600 --> 18:27.409
Listen, give me
a call when you can.

18:27.480 --> 18:30.290
I just want to make sure
you and the team are okay.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.250
Haven't heard back from you.
I'm getting a little worried.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.164
Anyway, just call me.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.409
Mohinder, you ready?

18:39.120 --> 18:40.884
Excited for the big speech?

18:42.200 --> 18:43.440
What's wrong?

18:44.440 --> 18:47.330
I'm trying to reach my research
team, but they won't answer.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.446
Do me a favor.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.086
Take this.

18:52.440 --> 18:55.091
"Escalating Evolution

18:55.160 --> 18:56.571
First copy.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.685
Just keep that.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.008
Okay? In case
anything should, um...

19:02.000 --> 19:03.047
I'm sure it's nothing.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.041
Dr. Suresh,
we've been looking for you.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.565
Miss Kravid would like a moment.

19:09.680 --> 19:10.647
I should, uh...

19:10.720 --> 19:12.563
Don't worry about it. I'll
see you after the speech.

19:12.640 --> 19:13.721
Okay.

19:18.520 --> 19:19.567
Hello, Erica.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.007
Mohinder, dear.
How are you?

19:22.080 --> 19:23.491
Well, I think.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.285
A little nervous
about my speech,

19:25.360 --> 19:27.601
but anxious to let the
world know about the HELE.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.284
Yes, about that.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.601
I'm afraid there's been
a change in the schedule.

19:32.680 --> 19:35.081
You won't be speaking
today after all.

19:39.440 --> 19:43.161
You're going to bury my research,
and you've had my team murdered.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.605
Is that all true?

19:45.560 --> 19:46.800
(DOOR CLOSING)

19:49.160 --> 19:50.571
You allow this HELE to happen,

19:50.640 --> 19:53.564
and the only thing you'll be
creating is man's extinction.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.447
No.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.400
I have a plan.

it does not include you.

dozen times and always regenerate.

There has to be a way.

Noah.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.682
The babies, they're important.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.805
I had a vision
about them, a prophecy.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.849
- Mr. Bennet?
- Dr. Roberts.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.046
Yes, the nurse said you
wanted to speak with me.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.128
Yeah, it's my daughter, Claire Bennet.
I need to see her.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.482
We're still assessing the...

20:32.280 --> 20:33.566

20:33.640 --> 20:35.290
Please, please, there's a spot
right behind her head here.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.328
If it's blocked,
it'll interrupt her power.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.970
Cause of death
was cardiac arrest

20:39.040 --> 20:40.280
due to a traumatic seizure
during childbirth.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.328

I need to see her!

Mr. Bennet,

20:44.480 --> 20:46.721
would you like to see
your grandchildren?

They have their mother's eyes.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.324
They're perfect.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.083
Where are you going, Noah?

21:18.480 --> 21:20.005
I have to see her.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.809
I have to see for myself.

That's why she's sending
things to the future.

33:06.280 --> 33:09.602

the only one capable of stopping it.

A year from now, Erica's still
looking for Claire's baby,

35:12.040 --> 35:13.610
so I must have done
something right.

35:13.680 --> 35:16.206
Your plan was sound.
We have to hide them.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.043
And I know the perfect place.

35:21.440 --> 35:22.885
The safest place.

35:24.160 --> 35:28.245
A year from now, Erica will be
looking for a one-year-old baby.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.801
And how old was Claire
when she manifested?

35:30.880 --> 35:32.041
Fifteen.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.205
They'll have time to mature.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.328
They'll be more capable
of stopping this thing!

35:36.400 --> 35:39.085
No, no, no, absolutely not.
It is very dangerous.

35:39.160 --> 35:40.969
Nothing we have done
has worked so far.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.610
Well, maybe we should
try to do something else.

35:42.680 --> 35:44.762
Maybe there's a way to take
Erica out of the equation.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.561
It is about fate.
You do not mess with it.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.802
If it is fated, yes.
Otherwise...

35:49.880 --> 35:51.325
You want fate's permission?

35:51.400 --> 35:52.561
My visions are fate.

35:52.640 --> 35:56.167

children will save the world.

to take care of them.

security footage

36:47.480 --> 36:49.562
and no one will ever
know they were here.

36:49.640 --> 36:53.087
