00:59.567 --> 01:00.834
Hi, ma.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.934
(sighs)

01:05.967 --> 01:08.667
Wait a minute, aren't you going
to ask why I'm sitting in the dark?

01:08.734 --> 01:10.967
I already know.
Your birthday's this weekend.

01:11.033 --> 01:12.600
You're depressed about being older.

01:12.667 --> 01:16.500
No. It's because you give me
such lousy birthday presents.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.633
You want better presents?

01:18.700 --> 01:20.700
Adopt Monty Hall.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.700
I wish I could.

01:23.767 --> 01:25.500
Jewish sons are the best.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.867
They give great gifts.

01:28.934 --> 01:31.800
You don't worry about them
getting hurt playing sports.

01:33.266 --> 01:36.600
Ma, trust me.
You'll love your present.

01:36.667 --> 01:39.033
-What is it?
-You'll find out Saturday.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.500
I'm old. I could die before
seeing it. You'd feel terrible.

01:43.433 --> 01:47.066
Of course, I would.
I got it on sale. I can't return it.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.266
Hi.
We shopped for Sophia's party.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.767
That's what I want to discuss.

01:52.834 --> 01:56.467
It's hard to find gift. What are you
getting Sophia, Dorothy?

01:56.533 --> 01:57.700
I'd rather not say.

01:57.767 --> 01:59.066
It's a surprise.

01:59.133 --> 02:01.133
-You know?
-That's right.

02:01.633 --> 02:04.100
How come she gets to know
and I don't?

02:04.166 --> 02:08.066
Oh. Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose.

02:08.133 --> 02:10.367
How can I say this
diplomatically?

02:12.633 --> 02:15.200
-You're a blabbermouth, Rose.
-You're a blabbermouth.

02:17.633 --> 02:20.667
Ok. So I made one little slip.

02:20.734 --> 02:24.633
I told Harriet Wexler you had
your ears pinned back in college.

02:24.700 --> 02:25.934
Oh!

02:28.300 --> 02:31.033
You had your ears pinned back?

02:31.100 --> 02:33.233
What did they use,
a big ear stapler?

02:35.500 --> 02:39.467
I made a few slips,
but I can keep a secret.

02:39.533 --> 02:42.567
Tell me what you got Sophia,

02:42.633 --> 02:45.834
and if I blab, you get
my most prized possession.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.066
I couldn't do that.

02:48.133 --> 02:50.333
I couldn't accept
your favorite album,

02:50.400 --> 02:53.767
"Hans Klebnermeyer
Yodels Beethoven."

02:55.400 --> 02:56.800
Thank you anyway,
Rose.

02:56.867 --> 03:01.233
I'll tell you what I'm getting ma
because I need your help.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.934
Oh! My nose!

03:06.934 --> 03:09.066
Ma, quit listening at the door!

03:11.834 --> 03:16.166
I'm flying my mother's sister Angela
over from Sicily.

03:17.367 --> 03:19.800
And she's bringing the surprise?

03:25.867 --> 03:28.433
Rose, she is the surprise.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.734
Oh.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.133
They haven't seen each other

03:31.200 --> 03:34.500
since Angela moved back
to Sicily 30 years ago.

03:35.433 --> 03:37.834
That's a wonderful surprise!

03:37.900 --> 03:39.433
I need your help.

03:39.500 --> 03:44.667
Set up the party, and keep ma out of
the house while I pick up Angela.

03:44.734 --> 03:46.066
Whatever you say.

03:46.133 --> 03:48.533
Ma!
Get away from the back door!

03:49.834 --> 03:51.800
You got eyes
in the back of your head?

03:53.000 --> 03:56.967
Why can't you relax
and enjoy your surprise?

03:57.033 --> 04:00.734
Because my last surprise
was your cousin Vito

04:00.800 --> 04:02.500
parading around in my girdle.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.066
You'll love this one, Sophia.

04:08.133 --> 04:09.834
You know what it is?

04:09.900 --> 04:12.133
Does blabbermouth know, too?

04:13.533 --> 04:14.700
Maybe.

04:14.767 --> 04:15.934
She knows.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.600
Rose.

04:18.667 --> 04:21.934
After dinner,
let's ride over to dairy queen

04:22.000 --> 04:24.367
for a couple of chocolate cones.
My treat.

04:24.433 --> 04:27.100
With rainbow sprinkles?
They're 5 cents extra.

04:27.867 --> 04:29.367
What the hell.
I'm a sport.

04:40.533 --> 04:43.767
Rose, you still here?
Dorothy's due back any minute.

04:43.834 --> 04:46.967
Sophia keeps coming up with excuses
not to go shopping.

04:49.867 --> 04:51.166
I'm ready, Rose.

04:53.033 --> 04:54.633
Sophia, what's the matter?

04:54.700 --> 04:56.900
I saw the doctor yesterday,
and he...

04:57.367 --> 04:59.400
I can't talk about it.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.700
What is it, Sophia?

05:01.767 --> 05:04.000
You dragged it out of me.

05:04.066 --> 05:07.266
My heart is bad,
but don't be concerned.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.900
I've only made love
in one position,

05:09.967 --> 05:12.033
but I've led a very full life.

05:14.867 --> 05:16.133
Let's go.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.000
Isn't there something
we can do?

05:19.066 --> 05:22.567
He says any surprise,
and it's "kaboom."

05:23.467 --> 05:25.400
All we can do is pray.

05:26.467 --> 05:29.233
Unless you know of
any surprises, Rose?

05:31.900 --> 05:33.467
Sophia!

05:33.533 --> 05:35.467
Stop trying to trick Rose

05:35.533 --> 05:38.500
just because she's weak, vulnerable,
and dimwitted.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.367
Yeah.

05:44.433 --> 05:47.400
Blanche, I give up.
Rose, let's go shopping.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.934
Sorry you got stuck with me.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I realize Dorothy's forcing you.

05:54.066 --> 05:55.200
She isn't.

05:55.266 --> 05:57.500
She always makes you
do her dirty work.

05:57.567 --> 06:00.800
She takes advantage of you.

06:00.867 --> 06:02.166
We should go.

06:02.233 --> 06:03.266
Wait. Listen.

06:03.333 --> 06:07.033
At movies,
who stands in line for popcorn?

06:07.100 --> 06:08.066
I do.

06:08.133 --> 06:11.133
When we vacuum,
who always lifts the furniture?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.133
I do.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.800
When we clean,
who always mops?

06:15.300 --> 06:16.200
Dorothy.

06:16.266 --> 06:17.400
Who cleans the mop?

06:17.900 --> 06:19.333
I do.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.533
She takes advantage, Rose.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.033
It's time you spoke up.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.367
There's no time like the present.
And speaking of presents...

06:29.533 --> 06:32.667
What are you doing here?
I asked you to take ma shopping.

06:32.734 --> 06:36.300
Put your mop
where the herring don't swim!

06:38.667 --> 06:40.600
I was this close.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.767
Dorothy, you're home.
Where's Angela?

06:48.834 --> 06:50.200
Out in the car.

06:51.467 --> 06:54.133
Aunt Angela,
you were supposed to wait.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.133
-Did anyone see you?
-Relax.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.533
Somebody passed by.
I made like I was a lawn jockey.

07:01.567 --> 07:04.100
It worked,
his dog tried to pee on me.

07:05.700 --> 07:08.667
Aunt Angela,
meet my friend Blanche.

07:08.734 --> 07:11.433
Blanche, this is my aunt Angela.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.066
Pleasure to meet you.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.333
-Shall I get Angela's luggage?
-No, she doesn't have.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.166
I never travel with luggage

07:17.233 --> 07:19.967
since I found a dead man
in my suitcase.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.633
You found a dead man
in your suitcase?

07:24.700 --> 07:26.433
Right. Picture it.

07:27.033 --> 07:30.133
New York city. 1956.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.300
I was a young widow
returning to Sicily.

07:33.367 --> 07:35.867
There I was on the boat, alone,

07:35.934 --> 07:39.333
watching lady Liberty
grow smaller in the distance.

07:39.400 --> 07:43.233
Suddenly, I heard a voice
from the vicinity of my knees.

07:45.033 --> 07:46.367
I looked down.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.100
There was a midget.

07:48.600 --> 07:52.834
It turns out his name
was Pee Wee Bombonzi,

07:52.900 --> 07:54.900
and he was fleeing from the mob.

07:56.133 --> 08:00.333
Well, for the next few days
we ate together, laughed together,

08:00.400 --> 08:02.700
and went for short walks
in circles.

08:04.300 --> 08:07.300
One day, suddenly
Pee Wee disappeared.

08:07.367 --> 08:10.133
We docked in Sicily,
and I was going through customs.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.934
I noticed a strange odor
coming from my suitcase.

08:15.100 --> 08:18.900
I thought it was the veal shank
for mother's day,

08:18.967 --> 08:22.300
but when the customs man
opened the suitcase...

08:23.233 --> 08:24.233
there was pee wee.

08:25.233 --> 08:27.800
Someone had stuffed him
in my suitcase

08:27.867 --> 08:30.967
between the veal shank
and my beaver coat.

08:32.233 --> 08:34.734
The mob had gotten
Pee Wee after all.

08:34.800 --> 08:37.133
You must have
been heartbroken.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.633
I was absolutely devastated.

08:39.700 --> 08:44.100
First, I had to burn the suitcase
and then the beaver coat,

08:44.166 --> 08:46.500
and the veal shank
never did taste right.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.800
Aunt Angela,
you made that up.

08:50.867 --> 08:52.700
Hey, I'm 80.

08:52.767 --> 08:55.867
If I keep talking,
I know my heart is still beating.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.233
Care for something to eat?

08:59.300 --> 09:00.600
Anything but veal.

09:00.667 --> 09:03.200
It's not because of Pee Wee.

09:03.266 --> 09:05.166
I had some on the plane.

09:07.834 --> 09:10.033
What are you doing home?

09:10.100 --> 09:12.433
I left my shopping list.

09:12.934 --> 09:14.166
Here you are, Sophia!

09:14.233 --> 09:16.100
She outsmarted me, Dorothy.

09:16.166 --> 09:17.700
You're kidding.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.266
I mean, how is that possible?

09:23.100 --> 09:24.166
It wasn't my fault.

09:24.233 --> 09:28.967
Backing out, Sophia told me
I ran over Mrs. Stouffer.

09:30.433 --> 09:31.667
And you believed her?

09:31.734 --> 09:33.400
I had to check.

09:33.467 --> 09:37.367
Last week, I pinned her to the fence
on a wide right turn.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.800
I'll get my shopping list.

09:39.867 --> 09:41.633
-I have your shopping list.
-Good.

09:41.700 --> 09:45.767
Everyone's happy, with the
possible exception of Mrs. Stouffer.

09:45.834 --> 09:47.700
Enjoy your shopping.

09:47.767 --> 09:50.867
Dorothy, why don't
I show Angela her room?

09:50.934 --> 09:54.367
Good idea,
then we'll catch up on family.

09:54.433 --> 09:59.934
Blanche could be the identical
twin of your cousin Apollonia.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.367
Apollonia was a stunningly
beautiful woman.

10:02.433 --> 10:03.934
Oh, thank you.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.500
Except for that huge
donkey butt.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.133
Hi, Ma. You having fun?

10:21.200 --> 10:22.533
No. Give me my present.

10:25.066 --> 10:28.400
Not until after we slice my "looks
like chocolate, tastes like spice,

10:28.467 --> 10:30.834
you'll wish you had a bigger slice"
marble cake.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.300
Know where it got its name?

10:35.367 --> 10:36.633
No. Give me my present.

10:38.734 --> 10:40.433
I'll go get the candles.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.200
Rose,
I got to congratulate you.

10:43.266 --> 10:45.700
You didn't give away my present.

10:45.767 --> 10:48.533
Stop trying to make me tell you.

10:48.600 --> 10:51.166
Relax. Dorothy already told me.

10:51.667 --> 10:52.934
She did?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.266
Yeah, what a present.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.166
Boy, was I surprised.

10:56.667 --> 11:00.300
I didn't know you told Sophia
that her surprise was in--

11:00.367 --> 11:01.567
Rose.

11:02.667 --> 11:03.867
Oh, all right, Ma.

11:03.934 --> 11:06.200
You'll get your present now.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.000
I give up. You win.
You always win.

11:09.066 --> 11:11.367
I know.
Me and mighty mouse.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.900
All right, everybody.
Gather 'round.

11:14.967 --> 11:18.033
My daughter's about to give me
my big birthday surprise.

11:18.100 --> 11:22.300
I want to say happy birthday
to my mother,

11:22.367 --> 11:25.700
whom I love very, very much,

11:25.767 --> 11:29.867
and I just hope
that you love this present

11:29.934 --> 11:32.867
as much as I love
giving it to you.

11:33.967 --> 11:35.567
Ok, Blanche!

11:41.700 --> 11:42.600
Angela?

11:42.667 --> 11:44.934
No. Gina Lollobrigida.

11:47.266 --> 11:50.033
-This is my surprise?
-Yes.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.700
Oh, happy birthday, ma.

11:52.767 --> 11:53.834
Happy birthday?

11:53.900 --> 11:56.367
You call this old bag a present?

11:58.834 --> 12:01.500
You brought me all the way
from Sicily to be insulted?

12:01.567 --> 12:03.066
I hate that woman!

12:04.066 --> 12:05.700
I hate her double!

12:18.834 --> 12:21.200
-Well, did you get them talking?
-Nope.

12:21.266 --> 12:25.166
I just spent a half hour out in the
hall talking to two closed doors.

12:25.233 --> 12:26.667
Don't feel bad, Dorothy.

12:26.734 --> 12:29.967
I talk to the little pigs
on my shower curtain.

12:31.166 --> 12:34.834
I was trying to talk
to my mother and Angela.

12:34.900 --> 12:39.100
They wouldn't talk to me.
I don't know what this is about.

12:39.166 --> 12:44.033
I do. One thing turns blood
relatives into enemies, jealousy.

12:44.100 --> 12:49.367
I ought to know. I was
a devastatingly beautiful child.

12:50.767 --> 12:53.600
Pink cheeks,
cute little button nose,

12:53.667 --> 12:56.533
red ruby lips,
adorable ringlet curl.

12:57.567 --> 13:00.367
I was the tallest baby
in the history of New York

13:00.433 --> 13:03.133
and had a rash on my head
till I was 2.

13:06.900 --> 13:10.467
Oh. Well, my sister Charmaine
was insanely jealous of me

13:10.533 --> 13:12.533
from the time I was
a gorgeous little infant.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.233
She was one year ahead of me
in school,

13:14.300 --> 13:16.300
and we used to compete
for everything.

13:16.800 --> 13:21.333
But there's one thing Charmaine
did excel at, cheerleading.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.934
She could twirl that baton
like a propeller,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.133
and she knew every cheer
in the county.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.500
She could twist her body
into an "R."

13:36.734 --> 13:40.333
Well, Charmaine decided it was
her turn in the spotlight.

13:40.400 --> 13:45.266
She challenged me to compete against
her for cheerleading captain.

13:45.333 --> 13:48.000
When the day came, we performed
in front of the entire school.

13:48.066 --> 13:50.600
Charmaine was fantastic.

13:50.667 --> 13:55.600
She twirled those batons so fast,
she looked like a landing DC-3.

13:56.100 --> 14:01.233
Then it was my turn, so I did
some cartwheels and fell once.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.133
I did a handstand
and almost got my balance.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.200
I only dropped my baton
4 times.

14:07.266 --> 14:11.934
When I finished, I was voted captain
unanimously.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.233
How was that possible?

14:14.300 --> 14:16.867
Underneath my regulation uniform,

14:16.934 --> 14:19.734
I wore black French lace panties...

14:21.834 --> 14:24.133
bearing the words <i>"bonjour."</i>

14:27.667 --> 14:29.734
Or was it <i>"Bon Appetit"?</i>

14:37.367 --> 14:40.734
I don't remember.
Anyway, it was something French.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.367
Guess nobody minded
I couldn't do a handstand,

14:43.433 --> 14:46.600
but they did appreciate me trying.

14:47.767 --> 14:52.500
I don't understand. Just once,
why couldn't you let Charmaine win?

14:52.567 --> 14:55.533
I told you,
jealousy is a terrible thing.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.367
That'll teach Charmaine
to be daddy's favorite.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.700
There's only one way
to solve this problem.

15:02.767 --> 15:06.400
We have to find out
what those two are mad about

15:06.467 --> 15:08.900
and force them to sit down
and settle it.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.867
It's like that Scandinavian saying,

15:11.934 --> 15:14.700
"You can let two angry mackerel
fight it out in a purse,

15:14.767 --> 15:18.100
but don't ever plan on carrying
that purse to a formal affair."

15:27.734 --> 15:29.000
Well, it loses
a little in the...

15:29.066 --> 15:30.834
(all) Translation.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.233
But the point of it is, it's human
nature to want to make up.

15:37.300 --> 15:40.200
People stay angry out of habit.

15:40.266 --> 15:44.066
If we get them to talk,
they'll do the rest.

15:44.133 --> 15:46.100
-Sounds logical.
-To me too.

15:46.166 --> 15:48.967
We're dealing
with two old women

15:49.033 --> 15:52.667
who think boils on a man
are a sign of virility.

15:53.900 --> 15:56.500
Logic doesn't exactly
apply here.

15:56.567 --> 15:58.600
At least we can try.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.266
She's right. You take Angela.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.233
We'll talk to Sophia.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.967
Fine. At this point,
I'll try anything.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.567
It's the size of a man's feet
that shows his virility.

16:09.633 --> 16:12.400
Really? I thought it was the number
of newspapers

16:12.467 --> 16:14.834
piled outside
the motel room door.

16:18.667 --> 16:21.433
Aunt Angela, please.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.633
We have to talk.

16:22.700 --> 16:24.900
What's to talk about?

16:24.967 --> 16:27.500
Your mother's
a stubborn old goat

16:27.567 --> 16:30.467
who apparently pays $1.50
to have her hair done.

16:31.633 --> 16:34.266
What's going on
between you two?

16:34.333 --> 16:35.734
I won't discuss it.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.000
Look, I've spent weeks working on
this surprise,

16:39.066 --> 16:40.834
only to have it self-destruct.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.967
Don't I at least deserve
to know why?

16:45.033 --> 16:48.000
Ok. Ok, you want
to know so bad?

16:48.066 --> 16:49.300
I'll tell you right now.

16:50.633 --> 16:51.600
Picture it...

16:52.867 --> 16:56.000
New York city, Christmas, 1955.

16:56.066 --> 16:59.300
It's Francesca Raguso's
annual Christmas bash.

16:59.367 --> 17:03.233
Everybody is there, eating,
drinking, guzzling the Pepto-Bismol.

17:04.467 --> 17:06.066
I mean,
Francesca's a beautiful woman,

17:06.133 --> 17:09.467
but she makes manicotti
you could anchor a boat with.

17:10.333 --> 17:14.133
As usual,
Sophia is stationed at the eggnog.

17:14.200 --> 17:18.300
She´s drinking right from the bowl
through a swizzle stick

17:18.367 --> 17:22.533
when my husband Carmine walks in
and passes right under the mistletoe.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.967
She makes a beeline to him
and gives him such a kiss,

17:26.033 --> 17:28.400
it practically sucks his beard off.

17:29.367 --> 17:31.567
I don't remember uncle Carmine
having a beard.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.834
He was in a Santa suit.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.967
He had a hook-on beard.

17:37.233 --> 17:40.066
Well, I mean, I can't believe
what I'm looking at.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.834
So I yank her
into the pantry, saying,

17:42.900 --> 17:44.767
"what do you think
you're doing?"

17:45.333 --> 17:49.400
She says she thought Cuneo the
bookmaker was in the Santa suit.

17:49.467 --> 17:50.734
I say, "that's a lie."

17:51.667 --> 17:56.233
We have a big fight,
she denies it all,

17:56.300 --> 17:57.633
and we never speak again.

17:57.700 --> 18:00.700
Oh, come on.
That was 30 years ago.

18:00.767 --> 18:03.033
Shouldn't you talk to each other?

18:03.100 --> 18:06.567
I won't say one word
unless she apologizes.

18:06.633 --> 18:08.700
That's the only reason
I'm here.

18:08.767 --> 18:10.233
Aunt Angela, please.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.166
We're talking about family here.

18:13.233 --> 18:14.867
Won't you try to work it out?

18:16.066 --> 18:17.834
Do it for your favorite niece.

18:18.333 --> 18:20.567
What's your cousin Graziella
got to do with this?

18:22.166 --> 18:24.333
Please, just do it.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.333
Please. Please.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.667
Pretty please.

18:27.734 --> 18:30.233
Oh, all right. Don't beg.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.967
You sound like
your uncle Carmine

18:32.033 --> 18:33.967
after he'd been away
on a goat drive.

18:36.033 --> 18:38.300
-(Blanch) Tell us what happened.
-Nope.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.133
Sophia, that's your choice,

18:40.200 --> 18:42.133
but I think you're
making a mistake.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.233
You see, the same thing
happened in my family.

18:44.300 --> 18:47.900
-My cousin Astrid--
-All right, I'll tell you.

18:49.367 --> 18:53.700
Picture it,
New York city, Christmas, 1955.

18:53.767 --> 18:56.400
Francesca Raguso's
annual Christmas bash.

18:56.467 --> 18:58.700
Everyone is there, including
the neighborhood heartthrob,

18:58.767 --> 19:00.100
Salvatore Demilo.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.200
All the women adore Salvatore,

19:03.266 --> 19:05.233
mainly because
he's the only guy with a neck.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.100
Anyway, I'm feeling
a little queasy.

19:09.166 --> 19:10.967
Francesca makes a great party,

19:11.033 --> 19:14.533
but she bakes manicotti
you could anchor a boat with.

19:15.033 --> 19:16.800
I go upstairs for a bromo-seltzer,

19:16.867 --> 19:21.367
when Salvatore grabs me from behind
and begins passionately kissing me.

19:22.266 --> 19:24.100
Being a respectable
married woman,

19:24.166 --> 19:25.500
I cop a few good feels...

19:27.133 --> 19:29.433
push him away,
and run downstairs.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.467
But I have to tell
someone what happened.

19:31.533 --> 19:35.734
I tell my sister Angela.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.533
Five minutes later,
everybody is talking about it.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.166
I drag Angela into the pantry,

19:41.233 --> 19:44.700
ask her how she could
betray her sister.

19:44.767 --> 19:45.800
We have a big fight,

19:45.867 --> 19:48.834
she denies everything,
and we never speak again.

19:48.900 --> 19:52.867
But, Sophia, honey,
that was 30 years ago.

19:52.934 --> 19:54.934
Isn't it time to forgive and forget?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.166
Forget, I do. I never forgive.

19:57.233 --> 20:00.033
But Angela's your sister.

20:00.100 --> 20:03.033
If she wants to talk,
she can find me.

20:04.233 --> 20:06.367
-In the closet.
-Ma...

20:07.000 --> 20:09.300
Angela has something
she'd like to say.

20:11.533 --> 20:12.834
So does Sophia.

20:22.834 --> 20:24.500
-Hello.
-Yeah, hello.

20:26.367 --> 20:27.967
Your hair got white.

20:28.033 --> 20:29.133
So did yours.

20:30.867 --> 20:32.700
You still got that cat?

20:32.767 --> 20:34.934
The same cat I had 30 years ago?

20:36.700 --> 20:38.200
Fine. You ask the questions.

20:38.266 --> 20:42.166
-Don't tell me what to do.
-Let's not lose our tempers.

20:42.233 --> 20:44.533
If you didn't come
to apologize, leave.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.900
Why should I apologize?

20:45.967 --> 20:50.333
You're nothing but a back-stabbing
judas in sensible shoes.

20:51.367 --> 20:53.100
Well, you know what you are?

20:53.166 --> 20:55.667
A two-lira tramp
with cheap bridgework.

20:57.633 --> 21:00.800
May you put your dentures in
upside-down and chew your head off!

21:02.734 --> 21:07.433
May your legs grow old and
gnarled like an olive branch.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.433
You should be so lucky.

21:11.133 --> 21:13.934
May your moles grow hair
thicker than Jerry Vale's.

21:15.033 --> 21:18.000
May your marinara sauce
never cling to your pasta!

21:19.300 --> 21:22.500
That's it. Come back here
and say that to my face!

21:32.266 --> 21:35.100
Aunt Angela,
you really don't have to go.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.834
Thank you, Dorothy. I'd like
to stay, but I hate your mother.

21:39.233 --> 21:41.100
Goodbye, ladies.
Thanks for everything.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.667
She's still here?

21:42.734 --> 21:45.166
No. I left an hour ago.

21:45.233 --> 21:47.800
Can't the two of you
say goodbye

21:47.867 --> 21:49.800
like civilized human beings?

21:51.500 --> 21:53.333
All right, that's it. I give up.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.567
Ma, goodbye.
Angela, let's go.

21:55.633 --> 21:57.166
No. Wait.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.900
I have something
I want to say.

22:00.567 --> 22:03.266
When I was little,
there were two people I admired

22:03.333 --> 22:05.967
more than anyone else,

22:06.033 --> 22:08.667
my mother and my favorite aunt.

22:08.734 --> 22:13.800
Now you're at each other's throats.
It's breaking my heart.

22:13.867 --> 22:15.734
So my mother
kissed your husband

22:15.800 --> 22:17.233
at some stupid
Christmas party.

22:17.300 --> 22:18.734
It doesn't matter now.

22:19.767 --> 22:25.333
Do you realize this may be the
last time you see each other ever?

22:25.400 --> 22:27.700
You want things
left like this?

22:27.767 --> 22:31.533
Are you referring to Francesca
Raguso's Christmas party

22:31.600 --> 22:32.900
back in '55?

22:32.967 --> 22:35.200
Yes. The one
where you kissed my Carmine.

22:35.266 --> 22:37.333
I never kissed Carmine.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.233
You never even kissed Carmine.

22:40.767 --> 22:43.266
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

22:43.333 --> 22:47.667
You wore a green satin dress and a
fringe shawl you did everything in.

22:47.734 --> 22:51.667
I lent that shawl
to Maria Finestro.

22:51.734 --> 22:54.233
-Who?
-The one with the huge breasts.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.433
Remember after the band left,
there was no entertainment,

22:56.500 --> 22:59.567
so the men pitched pennies
into her cleavage?

22:59.633 --> 23:02.900
She walked off with $19.

23:02.967 --> 23:04.066
Yeah.

23:04.133 --> 23:06.533
She wore the fringe shawl.

23:06.600 --> 23:10.900
It was Maria who came on
to my Carmine?

23:10.967 --> 23:15.000
-Him and all the other men.
-Why am I mad at you?

23:15.066 --> 23:17.066
You're not. I'm mad at you.
You betrayed me.

23:17.133 --> 23:20.200
I never betrayed
anybody in my life.

23:20.266 --> 23:24.266
You told everyone there
Salvatore Demilo tried to kiss me.

23:24.333 --> 23:25.633
I didn't.

23:26.133 --> 23:28.100
Nobody else knew but you.

23:28.166 --> 23:30.767
We were alone in the kitchen
when I told you.

23:30.834 --> 23:34.800
We weren't alone. Vinnie Giamela
was drunk under the table.

23:34.867 --> 23:36.700
What are you talking about?

23:36.767 --> 23:38.900
I can't believe
you don't remember.

23:38.967 --> 23:40.700
He threw up on your shoe.

23:42.533 --> 23:43.767
That was Vinnie?

23:43.834 --> 23:45.967
He must've overheard everything.

23:46.033 --> 23:47.667
He blabbed your secret.

23:47.734 --> 23:49.633
Then you never betrayed me?

23:49.700 --> 23:52.033
Of course not.
You're my sister.

23:52.967 --> 23:55.200
-Angela.
-Sophia.

23:57.567 --> 23:59.767
I don't believe this.

23:59.834 --> 24:02.266
I think it's sweet.

24:02.333 --> 24:03.734
I think I'm going to cry.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.867
I think they should
both be committed.

24:13.533 --> 24:17.934
(theme music playing)
