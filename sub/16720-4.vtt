00:19.977 --> 00:21.812
(video game music playing)

00:25.667 --> 00:28.669
That's the song I want to lose it to.
Mm-mm-mm!

00:28.670 --> 00:30.153
This is
exciting, right?

00:30.154 --> 00:31.989
A video game, right
here in our restaurant.

00:32.055 --> 00:33.840
Yeah, I used to be pretty good
at this game, too.

00:33.841 --> 00:36.109
By which, I mean best
in the entire school.

00:36.177 --> 00:37.037
Wow.
Yeah.

00:37.045 --> 00:38.695
We would not have been friends.

00:38.763 --> 00:40.130
I think we would
have, Louise.

00:40.131 --> 00:41.198
I was very cool.

00:41.266 --> 00:42.432
I'd be your friend.

00:42.433 --> 00:43.800
I don't care
if nobody likes you.

00:43.801 --> 00:45.168
It's him or
us, Tina!

00:45.169 --> 00:46.536
Uh, I don't know.

00:46.537 --> 00:48.021
Don't make me choose.

00:48.022 --> 00:49.823
Yeah, I think this could
bring in some real business.

00:49.824 --> 00:51.792
Maybe enough that we can
finally get that new vent hood.

00:51.859 --> 00:54.661
Oh, or we could get
sailing lessons.

00:54.662 --> 00:56.046
Or we could buy gift cards.

00:56.047 --> 00:57.414
They're as good as cash.
No.

00:57.415 --> 00:58.949
We could buy an island.
No.

00:58.950 --> 01:02.286
And then a smaller island
nearby, for farting.

01:02.287 --> 01:03.570
Did somebody say
sailing lessons?

01:03.571 --> 01:04.705
That's a great idea!

01:04.706 --> 01:06.156
You said that.
Oh.

01:06.157 --> 01:07.641
Okay, let's not get ahead
of ourselves, all right?

01:07.709 --> 01:08.694
Fart island.
Sailing lessons.

01:08.743 --> 01:09.743
God.

01:09.827 --> 01:12.713
(Video game music playing)

01:12.714 --> 01:14.131
Look out!
Ketchup bottle.

01:14.132 --> 01:15.382
Agh!

01:15.383 --> 01:16.533
GENE, LOUISE and TINA:
Ooh!

01:16.534 --> 01:18.302
I know, I know,
the ketchup's a killer.

01:18.303 --> 01:19.770
But I got on the board.

01:19.771 --> 01:22.105
80,000 points!

01:22.173 --> 01:24.418
B-O-B... one.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.410
"BOB1."

01:26.477 --> 01:27.505
Hey, Burgerboss!

01:27.512 --> 01:28.545
You play?

01:28.546 --> 01:29.713
Ah, a little.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.648
Well, why don't you try
beating my score?

01:31.649 --> 01:32.649
Okay.
Go ahead.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.785
All right.
(sighs)

01:34.852 --> 01:38.488
Yeah, you like
how these fingers feel, hmm?

01:38.489 --> 01:39.740
Yeah, you do, don't you?

01:39.741 --> 01:41.008
Huh?

01:41.075 --> 01:43.660
Yeah, I bet you never had
someone this good.

01:43.661 --> 01:46.213
Aw, you make me
feel like a king.

01:46.214 --> 01:47.447
Jimmy, my kids
are right here.

01:47.448 --> 01:48.498
Ooh!

01:48.499 --> 01:50.367
Please stop,
we're just leasing it.

01:50.368 --> 01:51.668
JIMMY:
<i>Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.</i>

01:51.669 --> 01:53.537
Yeah.

01:53.538 --> 01:54.871
Oh, yes.

01:54.872 --> 01:57.090
Oh, your corners are so smooth.

01:57.091 --> 01:59.042
Mm-hmm.

01:59.043 --> 02:01.595
Ooh, something to hold on to;
I like that.

02:01.596 --> 02:03.330
(Sighs)

02:03.398 --> 02:04.481
You got over
300,000 points!

02:04.482 --> 02:05.459
Ah!

02:05.483 --> 02:06.967
Dad, what was your score again?

02:06.968 --> 02:08.044
Never mind, Louise.

02:08.085 --> 02:08.985
What was it though?
Mm-mm.

02:08.985 --> 02:10.187
See you, Bob.

02:10.187 --> 02:11.388
Call me next time
you find something

02:11.389 --> 02:12.889
that you think
you're good at.

02:12.890 --> 02:14.343
Oh, hey,
almost forgot.

02:14.392 --> 02:16.259
Mm-mm-mm-mm. Huh.

02:16.260 --> 02:17.761
(Gasping)

02:17.762 --> 02:19.446
BOB:
Oh, ha-ha.

02:19.447 --> 02:20.647
"Bob Sux."
That's, uh,

02:20.648 --> 02:21.767
that's really funny, Jimmy.

02:21.783 --> 02:22.999
(laughs)

02:23.000 --> 02:24.935
Then, you know,
when I beat your high score,

02:24.936 --> 02:26.737
I'm gonna write,
"Jimmy Pesto is an idiot

02:26.738 --> 02:28.472
"and he doesn't know
how to spell 'sucks.'

02:28.473 --> 02:29.506
And he's dumb!"

02:29.507 --> 02:30.707
Dad, he's gone.

02:30.708 --> 02:31.875
I saw.

02:31.876 --> 02:34.277
Okay, enough is enough.

02:34.345 --> 02:35.912
He's not gonna taunt me
on my own turf, Lin.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.781
Okay, you know,
I'll just unplug it.

02:37.849 --> 02:39.326
Maybe that'll erase
the high scores, right?

02:39.384 --> 02:41.218
Yeah.

02:41.219 --> 02:43.203
(Video game music playing)

02:43.204 --> 02:45.305
Ah, that didn't work.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.040
You know what? I'll take
care of this myself.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.241
All right, well, hurry up.

02:48.242 --> 02:49.643
It's the kids' night
to do the dishes,

02:49.644 --> 02:51.395
so we're gonna have to
do them all over again

02:51.396 --> 02:52.381
before we go to bed.

02:52.413 --> 02:53.463
I'll be right up.

02:53.464 --> 02:54.631
This won't take long.

02:54.632 --> 02:55.482
Just gotta...
(knuckles cracking)

02:55.483 --> 02:56.482
shake off the rust.

02:57.535 --> 02:59.138
(Crickets chirping)

02:59.170 --> 03:00.771
(video game sound effects)

03:00.772 --> 03:01.738
(birds chirping)

03:01.739 --> 03:02.756
(sighs)

03:02.824 --> 03:04.725
Come on.
LINDA: Bobby?

03:04.726 --> 03:06.126
Uh-huh?
Could you take a break from that

03:06.127 --> 03:07.227
and help me with the grill?

03:07.228 --> 03:08.128
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
One second.

03:08.129 --> 03:09.529
No, this second, Bobby!

03:09.530 --> 03:11.131
You played that thing all night.

03:11.132 --> 03:13.834
Are you kidding me
with that pickle?!

03:14.669 --> 03:15.863
(Grunting)

03:15.903 --> 03:17.104
I saw that!

03:17.105 --> 03:18.622
Oh, Bobby,
is this turning into

03:18.623 --> 03:20.557
another one of
your peeing races with Jimmy?

03:20.558 --> 03:22.175
It's not called a
peeing race, Lin.

03:22.176 --> 03:23.376
It's called a
pissing contest.

03:23.377 --> 03:25.562
Well, you know
how these things turn out.

03:26.631 --> 03:27.875
Hmm.

03:27.882 --> 03:29.585
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

03:29.634 --> 03:30.586
Mm.

03:30.601 --> 03:31.668
Eh?

03:31.669 --> 03:32.686
(Grunts)

03:32.687 --> 03:33.670
How about this?!

03:33.671 --> 03:34.704
Nuh-uh!

03:34.705 --> 03:36.050
Hmm.

03:36.073 --> 03:37.441
I'm telling you, Bobby,

03:37.442 --> 03:39.509
you should learn
to just ignore Pesto.

03:39.510 --> 03:40.494
Hey, kid, back off.

03:40.495 --> 03:41.862
I feel your breath on my hip.

03:47.418 --> 03:48.417
I did it, Lin!

03:48.419 --> 03:49.563
Kids, come look!

03:49.587 --> 03:50.887
Did you beat Jimmy?

03:50.888 --> 03:52.522
What? No.
I broke 100,000.

03:52.590 --> 03:54.024
Fantastic!

03:54.025 --> 03:55.525
(Whispers):
Was it obvious I don't care?

03:55.526 --> 03:56.726
Just smile and nod.

03:56.727 --> 03:58.462
Well, I'm on my way
is my point.

03:58.463 --> 03:59.529
LINDA:
What?

03:59.530 --> 04:01.364
Again?
I can't stop now, Lin.

04:01.365 --> 04:02.933
Not until I can erase "Bob Sux."

04:03.000 --> 04:04.067
What's wrong
with your hand?

04:04.135 --> 04:05.134
Nothing.

04:05.136 --> 04:06.937
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

04:06.938 --> 04:08.472
Redrum. Redrum.

04:08.473 --> 04:10.123
Uh-oh, Bob.
You better go easy.

04:10.124 --> 04:11.741
You could have
the carpal tunnels.

04:11.742 --> 04:13.894
It's just a cramp.
I must be dehydrated.

04:16.046 --> 04:17.045
(Grunting)

04:17.047 --> 04:18.716
Ew.

04:18.749 --> 04:20.065
This can't happen now.

04:20.067 --> 04:21.935
Maybe I should see a doctor.
Good.

04:21.935 --> 04:23.436
Otherwise, I might
have to stop playing.

04:23.437 --> 04:24.515
Ugh!

04:26.274 --> 04:28.308
GENE:
Please tell me they shoot webs.

04:28.376 --> 04:29.910
Are we finally
getting a falcon?

04:29.911 --> 04:31.230
I think
they're flattering.

04:31.245 --> 04:32.512
Like wrist corsets.

04:32.580 --> 04:34.181
The doctor said
with these splints

04:34.182 --> 04:36.983
and these pain pills,
I should be good to go.

04:36.984 --> 04:39.302
Oh, he didn't tell you
to lay off the game? No!

04:39.303 --> 04:40.937
I can tell
when you're lying, Bob!

04:40.938 --> 04:42.889
Whenever you lie,
your eyes get crossed a little.

04:42.957 --> 04:44.524
The doctor said
the last thing...

04:44.525 --> 04:45.559
Look, they're crossing.

04:45.560 --> 04:46.593
I'll just shut
them. Ready?

04:46.661 --> 04:47.861
Okay.

04:47.862 --> 04:49.429
He said the last thing
you want to do

04:49.430 --> 04:50.897
is stop playing.
You're so full of it.

04:50.965 --> 04:53.166
What's gonna happen
if you can't use your hands?

04:53.167 --> 04:56.136
Yeah, how are we gonna do our
hitchhiking across America trip?

04:56.137 --> 04:57.804
Who's gonna play
harp at my wedding?

04:57.805 --> 05:00.807
And how will we become a famous
father-son close-up magic team?!

05:00.808 --> 05:01.807
(Door opens, closes)

05:07.315 --> 05:08.381
Lin?

05:08.382 --> 05:10.217
Oops. Overslept.

05:12.486 --> 05:15.205
Well, might as well take two.

05:15.206 --> 05:17.106
Morning, babe.

05:17.107 --> 05:19.611
Sorry I got to bed
so late last night.

05:19.644 --> 05:22.489
W-Where's the game?!
The game is gone!

05:22.547 --> 05:23.446
Bob, calm down.

05:23.447 --> 05:24.681
I got rid of the game.

05:24.749 --> 05:25.899
What?! Why?!

05:25.900 --> 05:27.067
Look at, look at me.

05:27.068 --> 05:28.218
It's an intervention.

05:28.219 --> 05:29.386
You have a problem.

05:29.387 --> 05:30.987
Yeah, yeah!
I do, Lin!

05:30.988 --> 05:32.556
"Bob Sux" is
on the game!

05:32.557 --> 05:33.990
And I need to
get it off!

05:33.991 --> 05:35.292
I'm gonna track
down that game,

05:35.293 --> 05:37.277
and I'm gonna knock "Bob
Sux" off the board!

05:37.278 --> 05:39.262
Okay, Bobby, okay.

05:39.263 --> 05:41.598
I'm not leaving any
stone unturned, Lin!

05:41.599 --> 05:42.766
They're all
gonna be turned!

05:42.767 --> 05:43.884
All the stones!

05:43.885 --> 05:45.085
Okay. Look at me.

05:45.086 --> 05:46.903
Look at me. Happy times.
I'm furious!

05:51.175 --> 05:54.210
I had the video game company
take your game away

05:54.211 --> 05:56.179
because I love you.
Mm-mm.

05:56.180 --> 05:58.815
It's like the time you took away
the credit card from me

05:58.816 --> 06:00.817
when I was ordering
all those porcelain babies.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.936
♪ If you're not real ♪

06:02.937 --> 06:05.822
♪ Then how come
I feel this way? ♪

06:05.823 --> 06:06.950
♪ Little babies. ♪

06:06.991 --> 06:07.974
Come here.

06:07.975 --> 06:09.142
(Kissing)

06:09.143 --> 06:10.193
Come here.
Aw, little baby.

06:10.194 --> 06:11.194
(Kissing)

06:11.262 --> 06:13.363
Linda, listen
very carefully.

06:13.430 --> 06:14.958
What?
Where did they take the game?

06:14.999 --> 06:16.766
Miles away by now, Bobby.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.168
Just forget about it.
Where?!

06:18.235 --> 06:19.235
Where did they take it?!

06:19.303 --> 06:21.465
You're spitting on me.

06:21.505 --> 06:22.466
Wait!

06:22.473 --> 06:24.468
Wait! Stop the truck!

06:24.508 --> 06:25.909
That's my game!

06:25.910 --> 06:27.594
Genie's out of
the bottle now.

06:27.595 --> 06:30.096
The whole world
will know "Bob Sux."

06:30.097 --> 06:31.297
This isn't over, Jimmy.

06:31.298 --> 06:32.815
I'm gonna find that game.

06:32.816 --> 06:35.118
And when I do, I'm gonna wipe
that smirk off your...

06:35.186 --> 06:36.452
Damn it.

06:36.453 --> 06:38.188
Check Family Funtime.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.623
That's where old games
go to die.

06:40.691 --> 06:41.824
(Slowing down):
Bleep-bloop-bloop-bloop.

06:41.825 --> 06:43.793
That's the sound
of a game dying.

06:48.933 --> 06:52.051
(Music playing)

06:52.119 --> 06:53.486
Ah, there it is.
Burgerboss.

06:53.487 --> 06:54.988
No adults allowed
without kids.

06:54.989 --> 06:56.122
Oh, come on, buddy.

06:56.123 --> 06:57.423
Why can't you just
let me play the game?

06:57.491 --> 06:59.058
Hmm, I don't know.

06:59.059 --> 07:02.028
Because I'm an adult and,
oh, guess what, so are you.

07:02.096 --> 07:03.663
Well, I have kids,
sir, all right?

07:03.664 --> 07:05.509
They're just not with me.

07:05.533 --> 07:06.699
So I'm gonna be playing...

07:06.700 --> 07:08.101
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:08.102 --> 07:09.969
I'm gonna need you
to go ahead and step away.

07:09.970 --> 07:11.271
Well, I just forgot
my keys, so...

07:11.272 --> 07:12.722
(gibbering)

07:12.790 --> 07:14.393
I forgot, I'm a cop!
Let me in!

07:14.458 --> 07:15.858
I know that trick, too!

07:15.926 --> 07:17.110
That's my badge
right there!

07:17.111 --> 07:18.261
Let me see that badge.

07:18.262 --> 07:19.562
No, I know it's
not a badge!

07:19.630 --> 07:21.180
Well, you better believe
I'll be back!

07:21.181 --> 07:22.916
Not without children, you won't!

07:24.785 --> 07:26.336
There he is.

07:26.337 --> 07:28.137
It's nice to have you
here for dinner, Bob.

07:28.138 --> 07:29.272
Sorry, Lin.

07:29.273 --> 07:30.940
Hey, uh, I have
to do a thing.

07:30.941 --> 07:32.191
With the kids.
What?

07:32.259 --> 07:33.393
We have a thing?
Yeah.

07:33.460 --> 07:34.694
But I don't have
anything planned

07:34.695 --> 07:36.162
until my birthday next year.

07:36.230 --> 07:37.397
You're taking
the kids out?

07:37.398 --> 07:39.710
Yeah. Well, it's,
um, it's a secret.

07:39.767 --> 07:40.600
For you.

07:40.601 --> 07:41.600
Oh!

07:41.602 --> 07:42.602
I love secrets.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.170
Tell me!

07:44.171 --> 07:46.506
Well, this wouldn't be
a secret if I told you.

07:46.574 --> 07:48.708
Does it have anything
to do with jazz?

07:48.709 --> 07:50.393
Mm, maybe.
Oh!

07:50.394 --> 07:52.055
No, no, it's not jazz.

07:52.062 --> 07:53.096
(Gasps)

07:53.097 --> 07:54.897
It's sailing lessons!

07:54.898 --> 07:55.893
You were listening!

07:55.933 --> 07:57.016
What?

07:57.017 --> 07:57.936
Right, yes.

07:57.952 --> 07:59.085
Sailing lessons!

07:59.086 --> 08:00.085
Sailing lessons.
That's...

08:00.087 --> 08:01.437
How did you guess?
Oh!

08:01.438 --> 08:03.623
This is going to be
very good for you children.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.458
You can join
the yacht club.

08:05.459 --> 08:06.793
White sweaters around
your neck,

08:06.794 --> 08:09.062
the gin and tonics,

08:09.063 --> 08:10.530
shoes without socks,

08:10.531 --> 08:11.564
private fireworks.

08:11.565 --> 08:13.285
Kapow!

08:13.300 --> 08:14.667
When do the classes start?

08:14.668 --> 08:15.835
Um...
Ba-boom!

08:15.836 --> 08:17.236
Tonight, in
five minutes.

08:17.237 --> 08:18.165
We gotta go.
Come on.

08:18.205 --> 08:19.606
Anyone else think it's odd

08:19.607 --> 08:21.107
our first sailing lesson
is at night?

08:21.108 --> 08:22.208
No!

08:22.209 --> 08:23.343
Probably a lot
of class work

08:23.344 --> 08:24.877
before they let you
out on the boat.

08:24.878 --> 08:26.145
All right,
we gotta go, come on.

08:26.146 --> 08:27.413
Let's go learn
how to tie knots.

08:27.414 --> 08:29.182
Tying knots! Yay!

08:29.266 --> 08:30.967
I'm gonna stow away
in a rope bin

08:30.968 --> 08:32.763
and fight a rat
over a block of cheese.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.270
If we see any mermaids,

08:34.270 --> 08:36.606
I'm gonna ask them
where their mer-ginas are.

08:36.607 --> 08:39.308
We're not taking
sailing classes, you rubes.

08:39.309 --> 08:40.943
Where are you really
taking us, Dad?

08:40.943 --> 08:42.195
All right, here we are.

08:42.279 --> 08:44.514
Whoa. Family Funtime?

08:44.515 --> 08:46.566
Now, if that guy asks,
you're my kids, okay?

08:46.567 --> 08:47.800
We are your kids.

08:47.801 --> 08:49.636
I know, but rub
it in his face.

08:49.637 --> 08:53.106
Excuse me, my <i>kids</i> and I
would like to come in.

08:53.107 --> 08:54.273
We were made
by this guy.

08:54.274 --> 08:55.408
Yeah.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.976
He had sex, then
we happened!

08:56.977 --> 08:58.244
Deal with it!

08:58.245 --> 08:59.779
I was wrong about you.

08:59.780 --> 09:01.047
They're beautiful. GENE: Thanks!

09:02.666 --> 09:03.900
Here.

09:03.901 --> 09:05.268
What is this?
Oh, that's one token.

09:05.269 --> 09:06.602
That's a token.
Okay, and then more.

09:06.603 --> 09:07.904
All right, have fun.
And then more?

09:07.905 --> 09:08.838
Have fun.
We need more!

09:08.839 --> 09:10.006
Can't. Gotta go.

09:10.007 --> 09:11.307
We can't play
any games with one!

09:11.308 --> 09:12.792
Ugh!

09:12.793 --> 09:15.395
We could go around and look
for interesting throw-ups.

09:15.396 --> 09:17.230
There's one.
There's one.

09:17.231 --> 09:18.731
I've got a better idea.

09:18.799 --> 09:20.066
You know what's free?

09:20.067 --> 09:21.061
Loading.

09:22.169 --> 09:23.536
Freeloading.

09:23.537 --> 09:25.655
Let's go crash
that kid's party.

09:25.656 --> 09:26.789
Oh.
Oh!

09:26.790 --> 09:28.975
All right, uh,
who needs a piece of cake?

09:28.976 --> 09:30.443
Who wants a piece?

09:30.444 --> 09:31.828
We do!
Cake, please!

09:31.829 --> 09:33.079
Thanks, that
kid's mom.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.231
Um, how do you know Kevin again?

09:35.282 --> 09:36.332
Soccer.
Church.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.483
Desert Storm.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.121
Nice move.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.406
Thanks, kid.
Do you mind?

09:43.407 --> 09:44.740
You're kind of
crowding me.

09:44.741 --> 09:46.670
Ketchup, top left, in three,

09:46.677 --> 09:48.547
two, one.

09:48.595 --> 09:49.962
Whoa. How'd you know?

09:49.963 --> 09:51.998
Well, I don't want to crowd you.

09:56.003 --> 09:57.472
Are you D-R-L?

09:57.521 --> 09:58.988
It's pronounced "Darryl."

09:59.056 --> 10:01.057
D-Darryl, don't go.
I-I need your help.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.859
Whoa, what's wrong
with your hands?

10:02.860 --> 10:03.770
Polio?

10:03.827 --> 10:04.927
Carpal tunnel.

10:04.928 --> 10:06.396
How old are you?
Old.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.847
Do you have a job or you
live with your mom? Job.

10:07.915 --> 10:10.016
What's your job?
I have a burger restaurant.

10:10.084 --> 10:12.029
Really? Is that so you can
get better at the game?

10:12.086 --> 10:13.186
It's unrelated.

10:13.187 --> 10:14.654
Listen, I need to beat
this high score,

10:14.655 --> 10:16.923
but I can't get past level 29
and that stupid chicken leg.

10:16.924 --> 10:18.257
What the hell
does a chicken leg

10:18.258 --> 10:19.542
have to do with
hamburgers, anyway?!

10:19.543 --> 10:20.526
Easy, easy!

10:20.527 --> 10:21.828
Ow. Damn it.

10:21.829 --> 10:22.895
What's your
name, anyway?

10:22.896 --> 10:24.414
I'm Bob.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.182
Of "Bob Sux."
Ouch.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.383
Who did that?

10:27.384 --> 10:28.851
A guy. Jimmy Pesto.
I hate him.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.186
I got a bully, too.

10:30.187 --> 10:32.004
His name's Tyler.
Picks on me every day.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.506
Oh, that's cool.
So, will you help me?

10:33.507 --> 10:34.791
Sure, step aside.

10:34.792 --> 10:36.325
No, no, no.
I gotta do it myself.

10:36.326 --> 10:37.610
I don't know, man.

10:37.611 --> 10:38.728
Your technique's sloppy
and your stance...

10:38.729 --> 10:40.263
why are you
standing way back?

10:40.264 --> 10:42.048
You got to press your wiener
against the game, like this.

10:42.049 --> 10:43.449
See? Yeah.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.584
Okay, all right.

10:44.585 --> 10:45.618
Wow. Oh.

10:45.619 --> 10:47.353
Yeah. Wow.

10:47.354 --> 10:49.858
I'll teach you,
<i>if</i> you beat up Tyler.

10:49.890 --> 10:50.823
How old is Tyler?

10:50.824 --> 10:51.758
He's 12.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.626
Well, uh, we'll see.

10:53.627 --> 10:54.894
Okay.

10:54.895 --> 10:56.796
I can't really
shake, 'cause my...

10:56.797 --> 10:58.698
You want to just
maybe E.T. it?

10:58.699 --> 11:00.283
God, <i>I</i> almost want
to beat you up.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.018

a bar mitzvah!

11:14.360 --> 11:15.509

(laughs)

11:15.562 --> 11:16.962
Oh, my God.

11:16.963 --> 11:19.097
They learned a ton
of knots, right?

11:19.098 --> 11:21.166
Mmm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Uh, absolutely.

Oh, uh,

11:35.181 --> 11:37.216
Ooh! I can't wait!

11:37.217 --> 11:39.218
I'm gonna start putting
my hair up in a ponytail.

11:39.219 --> 11:40.486
Why not pigtails, Mom?

11:40.487 --> 11:41.920
Twice as classy.

11:41.921 --> 11:43.922

11:48.127 --> 11:50.462

11:50.463 --> 11:51.780
I feel like I'm
glowing, Darryl.

11:57.737 --> 11:59.037
No. You kidding?

11:59.038 --> 12:00.220

12:00.240 --> 12:01.740
Video games and drugs...

12:01.741 --> 12:03.942
those two things don't mix.
Shut up.

12:03.943 --> 12:05.644
You're not too zonked to
beat up Tyler, are you?

12:05.645 --> 12:07.412
No. Who's Tyler?

12:07.413 --> 12:08.847
Who's Tyler?
Tyler's my bully!

12:08.848 --> 12:11.049
He could show up at any time!

This party is dead.

13:41.407 --> 13:43.075
Okay. Let's go.

There's gotta be something
bigger we can crash.

have any more cake.

13:51.918 --> 13:55.020

Hmm, I could make some room.

14:35.078 --> 14:36.511
This is not a drill.

14:36.579 --> 14:39.414
Tyler?
My bully!

14:39.415 --> 14:41.299
W... Wait... What're you doing?
What're... Don't.

14:41.300 --> 14:42.634
This will make
you look tough.

14:42.635 --> 14:44.336
And this will make
you feel tough.

14:44.337 --> 14:46.972
Hey, Darryl, I don't have a lot
of shirts, so don't do that.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.974
Oh. I thought your arms
would look bigger.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.726
Let's put
these back on.

14:50.793 --> 14:52.327
Oh, lookie
what time it is.

14:52.328 --> 14:54.196
Punch-thirty.
Nice one, Ty.

14:54.197 --> 14:55.263
Say something tough.

14:55.264 --> 14:56.198
Say something like
"punch-thirty,"

14:56.199 --> 14:57.399
then attack them all.

14:57.467 --> 14:59.101
Uh, hey, guys,
listen, all right?

14:59.102 --> 15:00.702
I'm an adult.

15:00.703 --> 15:03.138
And it's, uh, it's
gonna get kind of heavy here.

15:03.139 --> 15:04.506
Hold on, I forgot
the bicep band.

15:04.507 --> 15:05.697
Okay, punch his face!

15:05.708 --> 15:07.309
What the hell, man?

15:07.310 --> 15:09.177
I'm not punching
any faces, okay?

15:09.178 --> 15:10.812
I'm gonna talk to the faces.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.662
What are you doing, Bob?
Kick his ass!

15:12.682 --> 15:14.449
I got it, Darryl.

15:14.450 --> 15:15.751
Look, I know you, right?

15:15.752 --> 15:17.853
You're Tyler.

15:17.854 --> 15:19.955
And you have fun beating up
Darryl, here, all right.

15:19.956 --> 15:21.823
But Darryl, he doesn't like it.

15:21.891 --> 15:25.660
And let's be honest, there's
a race thing going on here.

15:25.661 --> 15:28.053
Darryl, you're something...
right? Black?

15:28.064 --> 15:30.048
That is not the issue.

15:30.049 --> 15:31.583
I beat him up
'cause he's a nerd.

15:31.584 --> 15:32.884
All right, I got an idea.

15:32.885 --> 15:34.436
Hold on, I'm just
gonna take a pill.

15:34.437 --> 15:35.454
Mmm.

15:35.455 --> 15:37.388
Darryl, I want you to smile.

15:37.389 --> 15:38.824
No.
That's good.

15:38.825 --> 15:41.359
And Tyler, I want you
to also smile.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.278
- No way.
- (Whispers): I'm so high.

15:43.279 --> 15:45.914
Okay, now, guys,
just touch...

15:45.915 --> 15:49.501
touch your smiles
together, okay?

15:49.502 --> 15:51.169
This is going really well.

15:51.170 --> 15:53.038
So now that we got that...

15:53.039 --> 15:54.506
(snoring)

15:54.507 --> 15:56.456
Bob? Bob?

15:56.476 --> 15:57.893
Bob?!

15:57.894 --> 16:00.128
Your bodyguard's
asleep, wuss.

16:00.129 --> 16:01.496
(Grunts)
Ow!

16:01.497 --> 16:02.681
That's for standing
up for yourself.

16:02.682 --> 16:04.182
(Gasps)

16:05.835 --> 16:07.252
Chicken leg!

16:07.253 --> 16:08.970
Aah! What're you doing?

16:08.971 --> 16:10.772
Yeah, Bob!
Unleash the beast!

16:10.773 --> 16:11.907
No mercy!

16:14.694 --> 16:16.528
Ah! Relish hole!

16:16.529 --> 16:18.430
Run! This guy's crazy!

16:22.285 --> 16:23.769
Fantastic. Not my problem.

16:23.770 --> 16:25.437
Thanks for coming
to Family Funtime.

16:25.438 --> 16:26.838
Drive safe.

16:26.839 --> 16:28.707
(Humming)

16:28.708 --> 16:30.075
BOB:
Chicken leg!

16:30.076 --> 16:32.271
(Thud)
Ow! I fell down.

16:36.672 --> 16:39.624
Help! There's a
crazy man chasing me!

16:45.314 --> 16:47.064
Yes! Tomato slice!

16:47.132 --> 16:48.516
Take that!

16:48.517 --> 16:50.251
(Screams, car alarm whoops)

16:50.252 --> 16:52.670
What do you think
those are for?

16:52.738 --> 16:55.172
You get one for
every octopus you kill.

16:55.173 --> 16:56.641
I'm taking one.

16:56.642 --> 16:58.476
Can I have that?

16:59.511 --> 17:01.345
I wish I'd met you sooner.

17:01.346 --> 17:03.080
I wonder what you looked
like 15 minutes ago.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.035
Dad! Some hairy guy's
trying to kill me!

17:08.036 --> 17:10.688
Burgerboss is gonna get you!

17:10.689 --> 17:11.872
Oof!
Hi, Dad.

17:11.940 --> 17:13.074
Bacon-wrapped scallop?

17:13.141 --> 17:14.208
Sure.

17:14.209 --> 17:15.159
(Phone rings)

17:15.160 --> 17:16.210
Hello?

17:16.211 --> 17:18.012
Hi. Is this Mrs. Belcher?

17:18.012 --> 17:19.512
Yeah.

17:19.513 --> 17:20.681
SECURITY GUARD: I'm calling from
Glencrest Yacht Club.

17:20.682 --> 17:21.983
Ooh!

17:21.983 --> 17:23.483
We need you to come
down here right away.

17:23.484 --> 17:25.618
(Gasps)
Okay!

17:25.619 --> 17:27.387
(Humming happily)

17:27.455 --> 17:30.274
Moisten the mizzenmast!

17:30.275 --> 17:32.009
What?
You know what I mean!

17:32.010 --> 17:34.312
That thing.
(kids grunting)

17:34.313 --> 17:36.013
The mizzenmast!

17:36.014 --> 17:38.099
All right!

17:38.166 --> 17:40.101
(Linda hums happily)

17:40.102 --> 17:41.969
♪ Three-hour tour... ♪

17:41.970 --> 17:43.437
You must be Linda Belcher.

17:43.438 --> 17:45.740
Yeah! How'd you know?

17:45.741 --> 17:47.274
Your family's in
the trophy room.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.409
Follow me, please.

17:48.476 --> 17:50.444
Trophy room!

17:50.445 --> 17:52.179
(Slurping)

17:52.180 --> 17:54.148
(quietly):
The mayor is here.

17:54.149 --> 17:55.583
Hi, Mayor!

17:55.650 --> 17:57.168
(Sighs)

17:57.169 --> 17:59.070
I'm glad you made it here
so quickly, Mrs. Belcher.

17:59.071 --> 18:00.755
We need your help with...

18:00.822 --> 18:01.756
...this.

18:01.823 --> 18:03.207
(Gasps)

18:03.275 --> 18:04.291
(grunts)

18:04.292 --> 18:05.609
Get away from me!

18:05.677 --> 18:07.261
What the hell's going on here?

18:07.329 --> 18:09.096
It's the Commodore's Balls.

18:09.097 --> 18:11.148
Your husband just
barged in here.

18:11.149 --> 18:13.984
We caught your children stealing
food and regatta pennants.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.403
And oyster forks.

18:15.404 --> 18:18.422
(Grunting)

18:18.423 --> 18:20.574
Princess Mayonnaise!
We'll go back to back!

18:20.575 --> 18:22.159
Let's fight our way out!

18:22.160 --> 18:24.678
All right, someone better tell
me what the hell's going on!

18:24.679 --> 18:26.047
Is this sailing class?

18:26.114 --> 18:28.532
Uh...

18:28.533 --> 18:30.401
Dad was using us to
get into Family Funtime

18:30.402 --> 18:32.136
so he could get
better at Burgerboss.

18:32.137 --> 18:34.321
Now he's in a k-hole.

18:34.322 --> 18:35.689
He tried to make me
kiss another kid!

18:35.690 --> 18:36.991
You deserve it!

18:36.992 --> 18:39.060
Who are you people?
Who the hell are you?

18:39.061 --> 18:40.428
I'm Tyler's father!

18:40.429 --> 18:41.762
And the president of this club.

18:41.763 --> 18:43.197
Ooh!

18:43.198 --> 18:44.331
Oh.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.567
Why didn't you tell me
this was going on?

18:46.568 --> 18:49.537
We were kind of busy,
partying our nuts off.

18:49.538 --> 18:51.072
Yeah, we were at Family Funtime.

18:51.073 --> 18:52.273
Partying our butts off.

18:52.274 --> 18:53.507
I said "nuts"!

18:53.508 --> 18:55.042
You know,
I'm so disappointed.

18:55.043 --> 18:57.044
This whole time, I thought you
were taking sailing lessons.

18:57.045 --> 18:57.978
(Crowd laughs, scoffs)

18:58.046 --> 19:00.614
Oh, shove it. Judge me.

19:00.615 --> 19:01.649
JIMMY:
Ah, hello, Linda.

19:01.716 --> 19:03.651
You're a member here, Jimmy?

19:03.652 --> 19:05.753
Soon. Top of the wait list.

19:05.754 --> 19:07.772
I forget, uh,
you guys members?

19:07.773 --> 19:09.390
(laughs)

19:09.391 --> 19:11.725
All of this is because you
went and wrote "Bob Sux"

19:11.726 --> 19:13.244
on a video game.

19:13.245 --> 19:15.362
You.
Aw, you're right, Lin.

19:15.363 --> 19:16.997
Let me see if I can
help out, huh?

19:16.998 --> 19:18.232
Bob sucks!

19:18.233 --> 19:20.618
(Yelling)
(laughs)

19:20.619 --> 19:23.988
Jimmy, you're just as pathetic
as Bob with your peeing races.

19:23.989 --> 19:25.956
"Peeing races"?
What are "peeing races"?

19:25.957 --> 19:28.809
That's not going to go over well
with the membership committee.

19:28.810 --> 19:30.077
Sounds like a sex thing.

19:30.078 --> 19:31.178
It does.

19:31.179 --> 19:33.214
But... (stammering)
Aw, come on, guys!

19:33.281 --> 19:34.498
Come here, you!

19:34.499 --> 19:36.917
We're leaving,
you pill-popping liar.

19:36.918 --> 19:38.035
Ow. Ow.
Come on!

19:38.036 --> 19:39.537
Ow.

19:39.538 --> 19:41.472
Your mini pizza bagel, sir.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.207
I don't even
want it anymore.

19:44.209 --> 19:46.853
Hold on. Yes, I do.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.382
Lin, I'm really sorry
I lied to you.

19:51.450 --> 19:52.917
And did drugs.

19:52.918 --> 19:54.235
And used your children.

19:54.286 --> 19:55.603
Use it or lose it, right, Dad?

19:55.670 --> 19:57.071
You know what, Bobby?

19:57.072 --> 19:58.873
At the end of the day,
it's for the best.

19:58.874 --> 20:00.941
Can you imagine being on
a boat with those people?

20:00.942 --> 20:03.410
Yeah. I mean, if we were gonna
have to be banned for life

20:03.411 --> 20:04.945
from someplace,
I'm glad it's there.

20:05.013 --> 20:07.248
Yeah, the caviar was too salty.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.750
Well, technically,
caviar is salty, Gene.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.986
Yeah, but I think they
salted it on top of that.

20:11.987 --> 20:13.988
They're idiots.
(door bells jingle)

20:13.989 --> 20:15.389
Oh, hey, Darryl.
Hey, Bob.

20:15.390 --> 20:17.024
So you're the video game coach?

20:17.025 --> 20:18.859
And you must be Bob's wife.

20:18.860 --> 20:20.427
She does have big boobies.

20:20.428 --> 20:21.729
(Chuckles)
What?!

20:21.730 --> 20:23.247
Yeah, okay.
(laughs)

20:23.248 --> 20:25.232
I might have said that
when I was high.

20:25.233 --> 20:26.901
Well, I came by
to thank you.

20:26.902 --> 20:29.236
'Cause of you, I'm not gonna
let Tyler bother me anymore.

20:29.237 --> 20:32.306
- Really?!
- I decided I don't want to be like you,

20:32.307 --> 20:35.643
a 60-year-old man,
still battling his bully.

20:35.644 --> 20:36.844
(Clears throat)
Okay.

20:36.845 --> 20:38.712
Uh, I'm not 60, by the way.

20:38.713 --> 20:40.848
But, uh, I'm
glad I could help.

20:40.849 --> 20:43.017
And you know something,
I'm all right

20:43.018 --> 20:45.986
with Burgerboss having
"Bob Sux" on the leaderboard.

20:45.987 --> 20:48.923
Aw, I'm proud of you, Bobby.

20:48.924 --> 20:49.923
Yeah.
Mm. Come here.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.894
(Quietly): Hey, you're gonna knock
"Bob Sux" off the leaderboard, right?

20:53.895 --> 20:54.962
I'm on it.
Good.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.514
Just change it
to "Fat Bob."

20:56.515 --> 20:57.481
"Dumb Bob" works too.

20:57.482 --> 20:58.716
Or "Hi, Bob!"
