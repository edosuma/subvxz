which is interesting,
because there's one in this room.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.566
- Wanna know his name?
- Pat Farrell.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.360
It's Pat Farrell. Pat's audience is old.

12:57.527 --> 13:00.701
Old people, much like
dogs, are blindly loyal.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.537
And if Pat hi-tails it to
Cedar FM and they follow,

13:03.700 --> 13:06.920
you've got a grey exodus on your hands.
A grexodus.

13:07.704 --> 13:12.050
Hm. That prejudices box doesn't
seem quite so cool any more, does it?

13:12.208 --> 13:14.757
Yeah, but we bought Cedar FM as well.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.263
I didn't know that.
I did not know that.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.024
- The point is..
- You were talking about Pat Farrell.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.693
Pat Farrell is a great guy.

13:30.852 --> 13:34.698
He's always the first to speak up
at union meetings,

13:35.690 --> 13:37.488
being a member of a union.

13:37.692 --> 13:43.040
He's also Irish, which again, weirdly,
a plus point, if you like swearing.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.950
"Feckin' dis" and "Feckin' dat".

13:46.117 --> 13:48.711
Some Irish people say “Feck off"
isn't as bad as "Fuck off"

13:48.870 --> 13:50.713
but I think that's bullshit
or bellshit.

13:50.872 --> 13:54.092
- The bottom line is, he swears too much.
- This is all very interesting..

13:54.250 --> 13:56.093
I can sum up Pat Farrell in ten words.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.927
Pat isn't very good so let him go, guys,
seriously.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.550
I can condense that to three words.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.309
Just sack Pat.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.194
That completes my presentation.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.531
Gentlemen, I'll leave
you to your biscuits.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.497
Gloves.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.161
Oh, fuck.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.666
Glove.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.213
<b>♪ Shape</b>

14:32.372 --> 14:34.966

14:35.166 --> 14:39.922
Ahhh!! That was soft rock
cocaine enthusiasts, fleetwood Mac.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.182
And this was Mid-Morning Matters.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.725
Where once again,

14:43.883 --> 14:45.931
- mid-morning.. mattered.
- Mattered.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.472
Supposed to do it in sync.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.273
<b>- Always leave a gap.
- Sorry.</b>

14:51.432 --> 14:52.809
Simple. Very simple.

14:53.184 --> 14:56.984
You're listening to Shape -
The Way You Want It To Be.

15:00.983 --> 15:04.283
Mm-hm. Right. And will it take long?

15:06.364 --> 15:09.834
It will take long. OK.
Hi, Pat. I'll catch you later.

15:10.451 --> 15:13.045
I'm not happy about it, but..

15:13.204 --> 15:16.083
I'll have to go along with it, won't I?

15:16.499 --> 15:22.723
The.. The problem is that the phone
rings even when I'm speaking on it,

15:22.880 --> 15:24.848
so it sounds bloody weird.

15:26.551 --> 15:30.021
In fact, I think it just did it then.
Did you hear it? Yes?

15:30.179 --> 15:32.273
Yeah. He heard it too.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.068
OK, well, I'll leave it with you.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.194
Mm-hm. Yep.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.730
Yep.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.694
All right. Thanks, Susan.

15:43.484 --> 15:46.328
If Geoff Susan doesn't mend that phone,
there'll be hell to pay.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.582
They wouldn't even let me say goodbye
to my listeners.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.243
Just gave me 30 minutes
to clear out my locker.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.955
Well, at least I'm getting
their mugs dirty.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.208
Thanks, Alan.
You always stuck up for me.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.297
Not like the others.

16:01.836 --> 16:04.339
Well, I'll let you get back to.. Geoff.

16:07.550 --> 16:08.802
- Who's Geoff?
- Geoff Susan.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.512
Oh, yes, of course.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.393
Ahhhhh..

16:17.602 --> 16:19.320
I did the right thing, didn't I, Lynn?

16:21.147 --> 16:23.195
I mean, I think he knew his days
were numbered.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.325
More of an assisted suicide really.

16:25.485 --> 16:29.740
I just flew him to Switzerland
and filled out a few forms and..

16:30.656 --> 16:32.454
sloped off to the airport.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.502
I've got to be honest, Lynn,
I'm feeling pretty crummy.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.960
Pat's Irish, isn't he?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.669
To be sure.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.585
Why don't you donate
£50 to Sinn Fein?

16:42.752 --> 16:44.470
Perfect.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.135
Love that noise.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.016
Keep me away from the sausage rolls.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.722
I'm wearing my chubby clothes again.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.975
- I noticed.
- What the chub, or the clothes?

16:53.137 --> 16:54.764
- 'Dad.
' MS/"Dad.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.849
Not that funny, Lynn.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.935
Bounce

17:01.938 --> 17:04.361
- I used to go with prostitutes.
- Brilliant.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.323
Cocaine - that was a trigger.
Cocaine, prostitutes.

17:07.527 --> 17:11.327
<b>Bit of a cycle. Puking up the old er..
luminous green bile.</b>

17:13.115 --> 17:15.083
Yeah, I was withdrawing.

17:15.243 --> 17:16.995
I've got my minder with me.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.038
- Lynn?
- She might not seem tough

17:19.205 --> 17:21.583
but I once saw her stamp on
50 cockroaches in a minute.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.467
He didn't see. He was in the next room.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.503
<b>- It was in Wales.
- It's true, yeah.</b>

17:25.670 --> 17:28.594
All I could hear was crunch, crunch,
crunch, stamp, stamp, stamp.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.851
I thought she was country dancing
whilst eating cereal.

17:32.009 --> 17:35.013
I thought it was the End of Days.
They were legion.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.601
Lynn likes The Bible.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.604
I've never understood moths.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.394
They only come out at night,
yet they're attracted to light.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.802
I don't know why they just don't
come out during the day.

17:43.938 --> 17:46.657
I've nothing to add to that.
If you substituted butterfly..

17:46.816 --> 17:48.739
Could you go and get me
some sausage rolls?

17:48.901 --> 17:52.826
If you substituted butterfly for moth,
I think it would sound like poetry, yeah.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.787
Unfortunately, Wordsworth didn't say:

17:54.949 --> 17:58.795
"I wandered lonely as a moth
to eat some jumpers in a drawer"

17:59.161 --> 18:03.211
"As if that wasn't bad enough,
it ate my sock upon the moor"

18:09.422 --> 18:12.266
Yeah. It's just.. I don't know why
a sock could be on the moor.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.393
A mitten, maybe.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.896
I actually spewed up some
of my stomach lining.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.103
I don't know if you've ever done er..
done any horse, have you?

18:20.266 --> 18:22.940
- I've ridden a donkey.
- No, no, no, I mean heroin.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.525
I know what you mean.
No, I've not done heroin.

18:25.688 --> 18:28.532
- I don't like subtitles in my films.
- If you can read, read a book.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.240
Citizen Kane. Black and white.
I haven't seen that.

18:31.402 --> 18:34.656
I tell you what, the best film for me,
ever, is still The Godfather.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.916
- Ah, amazing film.
- Perfect film.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.543
"I'm gonna make him an offer
he can't refuse.“

18:39.702 --> 18:41.545
- Amazing acting, though.
- Great acting.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.001
I tell you what's even better-

18:43.164 --> 18:46.714
a lot of people are shocked when I say
this - the camera angles.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.719
<b>- Alan, I need a word.
- Camera angles?</b>

18:48.919 --> 18:51.263
It's rather delicate.

18:51.422 --> 18:54.517
Remember when you took me for that
Christmas meal at the ice rink?

18:54.675 --> 18:56.973
You remember that woman
disinfecting the boots?

18:57.720 --> 18:59.313
The one that took a shine to you?

18:59.472 --> 19:01.600
I went home and you and her..

19:02.850 --> 19:04.727
Well, it's.. none of my business.

19:04.894 --> 19:08.148
It is none of your business, but for
the record, went back to her place,

19:08.314 --> 19:11.818
watched Air Crash Investigation,
then I fell asleep in her big armchair.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.406
A perfectly normal woman.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.162
Well, she's here.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.369
Lynn, get rid of her.
She's a drunk racist.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.121
- I'll tolerate one, but not both.
- Fine.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.541
But you said I could pop by any time.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.956
I know, but my career's
hanging by a thread.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.295
- And I'm an embarrassment, am I?
- No, no.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.923
You just wanted sex, you used me.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.679
Well, maybe you used me.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.932
L-I didn't have much of a say
over what went on that night.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.602
Didn't hear you complaining.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.271
- I couldn't speak.
- See you round mine again, then.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.976
I.. don't know, I'm.. I'm..

19:42.181 --> 19:46.357
- What's wrong with my place?
- Well.. all those dogs barking.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.192
But it's their bedroom too.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.490
May I have a word?

19:55.319 --> 19:57.538
You're talking clap.. crap!!

19:57.947 --> 20:00.496
I sound like a fucking Chinky
when I'm pissed!!

20:05.079 --> 20:07.548
There we go. All done.

20:07.790 --> 20:11.169
- What did you say to her?
- I told her that God loves everyone.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.629
<b>Even sluts.</b>

20:13.796 --> 20:16.015
- Good night, Lynn.
- Night, Alan.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.160
Hello?

20:44.410 --> 20:46.287
V funny. Tee-hee.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.706
Very impressive.

20:49.540 --> 20:53.215
Oh, they must have left in a hurry.
Something weird's happened.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.977
All right, you freaked me out, so just..
pack it..

21:05.139 --> 21:06.356
There you are!!

21:06.515 --> 21:07.983
Pat? Agh!!

21:15.357 --> 21:16.609
I'm down.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.497
You..

21:26.660 --> 21:28.788
You step to me?

21:29.497 --> 21:31.420
Simon.

21:31.582 --> 21:33.175
Er..

21:33.334 --> 21:35.336
Yeah, all right.
I'll go on without you.

21:50.893 --> 21:53.237
Stop!! Stop!! Stop!!

21:53.896 --> 21:55.819
- I need to commandeer this vehicle.
- What?

21:55.981 --> 21:57.824
- There's a mad man with a gun.
- Um..

21:57.983 --> 22:00.077
- He's Irish!!
- Get in.

22:01.529 --> 22:05.329
Why do you sit so close to the wheel?
I could steer with my balls!!

22:06.992 --> 22:09.745
- Where's the nearest police station?
- Just here.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.789
Oh.. thanks.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.050
Are you Alan Partrid..?

22:16.502 --> 22:19.676
Assault, battery, kidnap,
chronic thuggery,

22:19.880 --> 22:23.430
brandishment, actual bodily harm,
grievous bodily harm..

22:24.385 --> 22:25.887
<b>- ..harm.
- Just stick to what you saw</b>

22:26.095 --> 22:28.393
and we'll decide if it's ABH or GBH.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.729
- You mean aitch?
- That's what I said.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.518
Nearly, you said haitch.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.685
"Ha" is the sound of the letter,
aitch is its name.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.864
One is ha, the other is aitch.
Neither is "haitch".

22:37.022 --> 22:38.899
<b>- I'm sorry, I'm a bit nervous.
- Mr Partridge?</b>

22:39.066 --> 22:41.319
- Something else we need to talk about.
- Oh..

22:41.485 --> 22:43.579
- You're not in trouble.
- Oh, fine.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.084
I've never been in a police car before.

22:48.242 --> 22:50.336
May I lower the window, please?

22:55.040 --> 22:59.090
<b>Foxtrot Sierra. Alpha
Papa arriving at the school building.</b>

22:59.253 --> 23:00.971
- Officer.
- Mr Partridge.

23:01.130 --> 23:04.009
- You were at the police station.
- I was just in the car with you.

23:04.174 --> 23:06.222
- If you want to follow me, please.
- Huh.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.479
- This way, please, sir.
- Yep.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.391
Let's do it.

23:14.935 --> 23:18.314
Mr Partridge, this is the Gold Commander
of the operation.

23:18.856 --> 23:22.326
- Seriously, is that what you're called?
- On this operation, yes.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.403
I'm Acting Chief Constable
Janet Whitehead.

23:24.612 --> 23:27.286
- An honour.
- And I'm Martin Fitch.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.284
Send.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.999
From Scotland Yard's
Hostage and Crisis Unit.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.004
Here to lead the negotiation.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.257
Er.. little bit awkward.
Who's in charge?

23:36.415 --> 23:38.964
Make no mistake, this lady is in charge.

23:39.168 --> 23:43.423
So here's the situation.
Pat is refusing to speak to us directly.

23:43.589 --> 23:47.560
He's willing to give us three hostages but
only if he can talk to us through you.

23:47.718 --> 23:52.394
Now, we need to know why Pat has done this so
we can draw things to a peaceful conclusion.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.354
Yeah, sure, I'll talk to him. Deal.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.610
Sorry, wrong person.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.609
Come here.

24:01.732 --> 24:04.531
OK. Now, are you on any medication?

24:04.693 --> 24:06.695
Er.. Just some cream.

24:06.862 --> 24:10.742
I've got very aggressive athlete's foot but
that's the only thing about me that is.

24:10.908 --> 24:14.003
Do you suffer from any nervous
conditions, such as panic attacks?

24:15.287 --> 24:17.255
Do I look like I suffer
from panic attacks?

24:17.414 --> 24:19.542
I've had one panic attack in a car wash.

24:19.708 --> 24:22.837
It was a perfect storm
of no sleep, no wife,

24:23.420 --> 24:25.673
and angry brushes whirring towards me.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.768
By the time the giant hair dryer
came on, I was in the footwell.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.435
Does the idea of weaponry trouble you?

24:34.598 --> 24:38.228
Er.. no. I've fired several rifles,
at fun fairs, and won prizes.

24:38.394 --> 24:41.364
But I've never fired one
in anger, or at a cat.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.571
We'll have you fully briefed
by the tactical firearms team.

24:44.733 --> 24:45.700
Cool.

24:45.859 --> 24:48.362
We'll keep in regular phone
contact with you when you go in.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.122
Very cool. Sorry, go in?

24:50.280 --> 24:52.749
- What, into the building?
- Mm-hm.

24:53.283 --> 24:56.412
- To speak to Pat in person?
- Yes, is that not what you..

24:58.288 --> 25:00.711
- Erm..
- Everything OK?

25:01.458 --> 25:04.553
I'm just a little nervous about
going into a car wash.. er.. siege.

25:04.753 --> 25:07.427
So what do you say, Al?
Will you help us?

25:16.056 --> 25:17.103
Yep.

25:17.641 --> 25:21.066
Guys, none of us choose
the hand we're dealt..

25:23.230 --> 25:25.483
- You know..
- We do need an answer, I'm afraid.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.284
Do you have another siege to go to?

25:27.443 --> 25:30.204
It's my understanding that if you say
yes, you're allowed a few words.

25:30.279 --> 25:32.577
- So you are saying yes?
- I was leaving that to the end.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.367
- If you'd like to come with me.
- Sure.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.535
Can I get a copy of that?

25:36.702 --> 25:39.296
- Let's keep this simple, shall we?
- Roger, that.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.207
<b>- No heroics.
- Ten-four, good buddy.</b>

25:41.415 --> 25:43.417
Do not physically engage him.

25:43.584 --> 25:46.053
- Fight a gun, flee a knife, yeah?
- Where do you read that?

25:46.211 --> 25:48.179
Big fans of you guys in TFU.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.887
If I had my way, all police
officers would carry firearms.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.929
I think that firearms should remain
in the hands of specialists.

25:54.094 --> 25:57.314
I was going to say that only specialists
should be allowed to fire them.

25:57.473 --> 26:00.192
If you think I've just made that up,
you can call my assistant.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.523
Alan!! Read my lips.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.939
If you jeopardize the safety
of any of my men,

26:05.105 --> 26:08.450
or any of those hostages
because you've not been listening to me,

26:08.609 --> 26:12.239
I will take off this police uniform
and I will make you pay for it.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.749
You want me to buy your police
uniform off you?

26:15.908 --> 26:18.536
No. I'll give you a fucking good hiding,
is that clear?

26:18.702 --> 26:20.579
Yes, that's clear. Yes.
That's clear.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.840
You're close to me.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.339
Now, you're a smart bloke,
I know you can handle it.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.675
- I know you won't disappoint me.
- I won't.

26:28.837 --> 26:31.636
<b>I aim to please you,
and I.. I hope to impress you.</b>

26:32.091 --> 26:34.469
- Good man.
- Yeah, you're a good man too.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.225
Right, well, Dom will fill you in.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.528
He has to say all that
shit for the insurance.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.405
- Right.
- Tell me this much, mate.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.942
- What's your favourite siege?
- Iranian Embassy.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.235
Same. Why?

26:51.401 --> 26:53.002
They used the sound of a pneumatic drill

26:53.112 --> 26:56.332
to disguise the noise of them removing
bricks from a neighbouring wall.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.285
- So they could smash through and..
- Take them out the game.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.545
It's just a great siege.

27:02.663 --> 27:03.789
Right.

27:05.207 --> 27:06.709
Do you want to see my gun?

27:07.084 --> 27:09.178
Does erm.. Yes, please.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.474
Let's clock the Glock.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.803
You'll have to move quicker than that.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.723
- Any last messages for your kids?
- Oh.. Er..

27:20.889 --> 27:22.607
No, they don't speak to me any more.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.689
Yeah, "Why don't you
speak to me any more?"

27:24.852 --> 27:26.399
I wouldn't know the answer, would I?

27:26.562 --> 27:30.442
<b>So just um.. just..
tell them I love them.</b>

27:38.282 --> 27:40.910
Pat, Alan's coming in now.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.472
- Greg!!
- Oh.. Hey, Alan. Thanks.

27:57.634 --> 28:01.559
- They let you go as well?
- I'm relieved to be getting out of there.

28:01.722 --> 28:04.191
- Aren't there still women in there?
- Yeah, well..

28:04.391 --> 28:07.770
I think it would be a bit sexist
to let all the women go out first.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.234
Yeah. Sleep well, Greg.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.944
Thanks.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.493
Pat?

28:20.866 --> 28:22.243
Pat?

28:23.243 --> 28:24.290
Pat?

28:33.503 --> 28:35.597
<b>- Prepare to die.
- I'm not ready to!!</b>

28:36.215 --> 28:38.183
Alan, it's OK, it's OK, it's me.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.344
It's me - Pat.

28:40.510 --> 28:41.602
God, you..

28:41.762 --> 28:45.187
I just thought a little jokey costume
would, you know, put you at ease,

28:45.349 --> 28:48.353
- give you a giggle.
- Well.. mission accomplished.

28:49.353 --> 28:50.570
Oh, God.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.697
- It's great to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

28:52.856 --> 28:55.700
I bought you some cake,
not that you deserve it after that.

28:55.859 --> 28:58.237
I should just crush it in my hand.
Oh, I already have.

28:58.403 --> 29:01.327
- How the devil are you?
- Yeah, not bad, not bad.

29:01.490 --> 29:02.912
How are you feeling?

29:03.075 --> 29:04.748
- Great!!
- Good.

29:04.952 --> 29:07.296
Oh, er.. the police told
me to bring you this.

29:07.454 --> 29:09.127
It's just a standard field phone,

29:09.289 --> 29:12.509
should you feel the inclination
to communicate with ze authorities.

29:12.668 --> 29:16.138
Good thing about these things, they're
immune to the problems and glitches

29:16.296 --> 29:18.390
you get with satellite phones.

29:18.924 --> 29:21.427
But, like I say, it's
just an option, really.

29:21.635 --> 29:27.108
I just realised, when you asked me
now how I was feeling, you meant..

29:27.266 --> 29:29.268
Yes, I did.

29:30.686 --> 29:33.280
- Does this answer your question?
- Yes, it does.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.532
Oh, hello.
Didn't see you there.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.693
Someone's been in the wars.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.157
- That's just Simon.
- Can he breathe through that?

29:40.320 --> 29:42.197
Of course. It's just
like wearing a mask.

29:42.364 --> 29:45.163
At least when someone puts you in
a mask, you've got a safe word,

29:45.325 --> 29:47.373
like "airbag", or "crayfish".

29:48.829 --> 29:50.752
What's the er..
That thing?

29:50.956 --> 29:53.550
Oh, we made that. It's a head holster.

29:53.709 --> 29:57.430
- Never heard of one of those.
- Yeah, I'll show you. Simon?

29:57.754 --> 29:59.848
You insert the shotgun.

30:00.382 --> 30:02.350
Place on stand.
And.. voilá.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.978
Hands free. I can move around
the studio, do anything I want.

30:05.137 --> 30:08.266
And if something happens..
I don't even have to look.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.814
Boom. Hit the target.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.195
Yeah.. well,
you don't need an accomplice.

30:13.353 --> 30:15.321
Well, I've got you now.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.982
Yeah.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.827
Thank you.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.328
So you're with the police now?

30:27.743 --> 30:29.745
<b>Oh, this.. no, this is just..</b>

30:29.911 --> 30:31.879
I think it's Velcro.
There you go.

30:32.039 --> 30:33.586
Feck the police.

30:33.790 --> 30:36.339
I think they thought that
if they did take a pot shot at you -

30:36.501 --> 30:38.174
it's a siege, you've got a gun -

30:38.337 --> 30:40.510
that the bullet might pass through you
and hit me.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.925
Unless they use dum-dums,
which explode inside the body.

30:43.133 --> 30:46.262
I said, do not use dum-dums on
Pat Ferrell, Farrell, Ferrell.

30:46.428 --> 30:49.227
Just use a high-velocity round
that passes through his body

30:49.431 --> 30:50.933
because he's a friend of mine.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.943
And I suppose if I want to shoot you,
I can always aim for the head.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.479
Exactly. Exactly.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.940
Um.. I don't even
know why I'm wearing it.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.363
- So take it off.
- I'll happily take it off.

31:00.525 --> 31:01.697
Go on, then.

31:01.902 --> 31:04.302
- If you want me to, I'll take it off.
- Fucking take it off!!

31:04.446 --> 31:06.949
Oh, Pat, now you're making
me want to wear it.

31:07.157 --> 31:09.080
This is not my bag.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.877
I'm-I'm-I'm.. a disc jockey.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.004
I'm sorry you got the sack.

31:13.163 --> 31:17.418
I'm 55 years old, I should be at home in
bed watching funny videos on YouTube.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.429
"Sneezing panda" or
"Charlie bit my finger".

31:22.214 --> 31:24.558
Have you seen
"Fat woman falls down the hole"?

31:28.929 --> 31:30.647
- That's hilarious. Isn't it?
- Yeah.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.774
I've seen it before, but, yeah.

31:32.933 --> 31:37.029
That.. That should be fenced off really,
but erm.. I'm glad it wasn't.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.026
Great.

31:39.272 --> 31:42.151
Oh, yeah, I'm supposed to ask,
where are the hostages?

31:42.317 --> 31:44.069
In there.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.624
Oh, my God!!

31:48.990 --> 31:51.869
That's like some son of zoo
from Planet Of The Apes.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.539
Danny looks a bit.. bruised.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.749
I lost my temper a couple of times.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.669
- Three times.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it was three.

32:01.670 --> 32:02.887
Go and say hello.

32:03.046 --> 32:05.890
- Give him a slap yourself, if you want.
- Oh, no..

32:07.884 --> 32:09.761
No, I'll just..
I'll just say hello.

32:10.846 --> 32:13.395
- Alan..
- Look, do the police know we're here?

32:13.557 --> 32:15.184
Alan!! What the hell's going on?

32:17.102 --> 32:19.025
Hey!! Hey, hey, hey!!

32:19.229 --> 32:22.278
Cool it with the cross-talk,
you're professional broadcasters.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.069
- I'm not, I'm a writer.
- We'll get through this with each other.

32:25.235 --> 32:28.865
I want everyone to shake hands with everyone else.
Now!! Whether you want to or not.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.907
This is ridiculous.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.701
Ow.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.911
Hello, er.. Connor.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.257
- Paper.
- Hi.

32:39.416 --> 32:42.420
OK. Pat will not communicate
directly with the police.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.634
Only through me.

32:44.796 --> 32:48.141
So as of now, I am bullhorn.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.803
- But I think we're gonna be OK.
- OK? He hit me!!

32:50.969 --> 32:54.644
Let's not get into who hit who or,
you know, who may have deserved it.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.854
You need to keep him away from me.
Understand?

32:57.017 --> 32:58.735
What I need to do, Danny,

32:58.935 --> 33:01.108
in conjunction with Jason,
is crisis management.

33:01.271 --> 33:03.432
I'm sure he'll agree
there has been plenty of crisis..

33:03.565 --> 33:06.239
<b>- But no management.
- Cowabunga. Walk with me.</b>

33:07.986 --> 33:10.455
Alan, you do realise
you're in the box seat here?

33:10.614 --> 33:12.036
You've got the guy's confidence.

33:12.199 --> 33:13.291
Yeah. I don't know why.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.712
I go for a curry with him once a year,
and even then I don't have a starter.

33:16.870 --> 33:18.122
Trouble is, he does.

33:18.288 --> 33:20.256
All I need to know is can
you handle it?

33:20.415 --> 33:21.792
Well, er..

33:21.958 --> 33:24.586
Would you ask that of a man
who'd gone paint-balling,

33:24.753 --> 33:27.927
realised he'd left his goggles at
reception but carried on anyway?

33:28.131 --> 33:29.678
- Why?
- You're looking at him.

33:29.925 --> 33:31.848
OK, guys,
quick wa-wa.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.513
Just had a pow-wow with Jase,
upshot is..

33:35.180 --> 33:37.274
I'm gonna be his right-hand
man on this one.

33:37.474 --> 33:40.273
He'll be um.. my left-hand man.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.771
<b>- Er..
- Sorry.</b>

33:42.938 --> 33:45.657
The point is,
Pat has not gone mad.

33:46.107 --> 33:48.701
He has a grievance.
He needs some son of outlet.

33:48.860 --> 33:55.084
This is Pat Farrell, welcoming you to Roll
Out The Farrell on North Norfolk Digital.

33:55.283 --> 33:57.627
OK. Pat may have..
may have gone mad.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.834
He may have gone mad.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.672
<b>And now we have a text from
Cynthia in Holt, who writes,</b>

34:03.833 --> 34:05.551
<b>Dear Pat, we are sending you a bottle..</b>

34:05.752 --> 34:08.972
<b>- Ma'am, you'd better listen to this.
- ..Of our homemade plum brandy.</b>

34:09.130 --> 34:11.098
<b>We use it to make brandy butter..</b>

34:11.258 --> 34:14.683
- Why am I listening to shit radio?
- That's Pat Farrell, ma'am.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.437
He's broadcasting from the siege.

34:16.596 --> 34:19.019
<b>Mm, yum, Cynthia.
Can't wait.</b>

34:19.224 --> 34:21.943
Can you gently remind Pat
that we had an agreement?

34:22.102 --> 34:24.070
You are there to communicate with us.

34:24.229 --> 34:27.733
Listen, I don't know what it says
in your police operation manual..

34:27.899 --> 34:30.618
- ..or in Psycho-babble Weekly.
- Penguin Book of Sieges.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.742
or The Penguin Book of Sieges,

34:32.946 --> 34:35.995
but out here in the field,
it's plenty different.

34:37.033 --> 34:41.209
I've got a guy with a gun and a gripe
to grind, and he say, "No speaky."

34:41.371 --> 34:44.375
I would really like to establish
a dialogue here, Alan.

34:44.541 --> 34:47.715
A simple tri-lateral exchange,
from Pat, to you, to me, to you, to Pat.

34:47.877 --> 34:50.847
- Do you understand?
- No more interruptions or else!!

34:51.006 --> 34:53.680
You think I don't have balls?
I've got plenty of balls!!

34:53.842 --> 34:56.311
I've got balls coming
out of my arse!!

34:58.430 --> 35:00.853
- Er.. did you hear that?
- Yes.

35:01.391 --> 35:04.270
<b>Well, that's.. that's the
end of the call. Bye.</b>

35:05.353 --> 35:08.197
You are listening to
North Norfolk Digital.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.863
<b>Shape.</b>

35:11.026 --> 35:12.744
<b>The Way You Want It To Be.</b>

35:12.902 --> 35:15.280
<b>The way you want it to be</b>

35:15.447 --> 35:18.166
- Where are all my jingles?
- Jason wanted them deleted.

35:18.325 --> 35:20.645
- He won't have deleted them all.
- He did delete them all.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.458
- He did delete them all, Pat.
- What?

35:22.621 --> 35:25.215
- It was jingle genocide.
- That's not helping, Simon.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.297
The bastard. Alan, take over for me.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.550
<b>- No.
- I'm gonna straighten him out.</b>

35:33.381 --> 35:35.475
Oh, and.. keep it light.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.144
Right, um.. OK.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.726
You're listening to the
Pat and Alan Show.

35:41.056 --> 35:43.184
- Mainly Pat.
- You, Jason. Yeah, you.

35:43.350 --> 35:46.024
We'll be asking.. w-what time..

35:47.395 --> 35:52.902
does mike paper slider
switch to.. to..

35:53.068 --> 35:56.914
to mouse his chocolate cups?

35:57.072 --> 35:59.291
- It doesn't make sense.
- It doesn't make sense

35:59.491 --> 36:04.247

36:14.005 --> 36:16.508
Oh, shit.

you for most of my life..

One hour.

what I just said,

36:44.244 --> 36:48.715
I am going to shoot you in the feet,
then the knees, then the hands.

36:49.791 --> 36:53.216

got two of, like your face.

I'm gonna fucking die.

37:06.015 --> 37:07.767
What are we gonna do?

37:07.934 --> 37:09.902
You can't do a top-quality
jingle in an hour.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.065
We can do this. Let me
tell you a story, um..

37:13.231 --> 37:16.610
Back in the day, I was MC-ing a
conference for Reynard Pharmaceuticals.

37:16.818 --> 37:19.321
Some of the marketing guys
were doing karaoke.

37:19.487 --> 37:22.161
I didn't join in,
I tended to shun Japanese culture.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.667
This was the mid-90s,
it was more acceptable.

37:24.826 --> 37:27.921
But high on a cocktail of champagne
and cheap Fosters lager,

37:28.079 --> 37:30.002
I lunged at the microphone.

37:30.165 --> 37:32.418
A few minutes later,
I was making grown men cry

37:32.584 --> 37:35.554
with my rendition of Summer Of '69
by Bryan Adams.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.594
Thing is, I twisted the
lyrics to the Summer Of '29,

37:38.798 --> 37:42.098
evoking memories of the Wall Street
Crash and German hyperinflation.

37:42.260 --> 37:46.106
- Remember, these guys were in sales.
- Alan, where are you going with this?

37:46.264 --> 37:48.608
The point is, he didn't think
he was any good at singing,

37:48.767 --> 37:50.610
and it turns out he was quite good.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.067
- Yeah, that.
- And that if you really, really try

37:53.229 --> 37:54.697
- you can do anything.
- And that.

37:54.856 --> 37:57.405
I don't care!! I'm going to fucking die!!

37:57.609 --> 38:01.034
Hey, hey, I'm trying to save your head,
shoulders, knees and toes.

38:01.196 --> 38:04.325
- Knees and toes.
- OK, man up, musos.

38:04.491 --> 38:06.994
- I played synth in a jazz funk band.
- Great, who else?

38:07.160 --> 38:09.128
I used to be the drummer
in Marillion.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.381
Really? There's no time for that.

38:11.539 --> 38:14.133
<b>- But wow and great.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.385

38:35.313 --> 38:36.690

38:36.856 --> 38:38.574
He wasn't stealing crisps.

38:38.733 --> 38:41.031
He just gets flustered at
self-service checkouts

38:41.194 --> 38:43.822
- and takes things without scanning them.
- Miss Benfield..

38:43.988 --> 38:47.913
He doesn't like being told to put things
in bagging areas by automated women.

38:48.076 --> 38:50.670
No, Miss Benfield, we're here
because Mr Partridge is

38:50.870 --> 38:52.668
currently involved in an armed siege.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.758

40:13.411 --> 40:16.039

He's a strong man, with strong arms
and a good walk. Moves well.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.197
Sounds quite good.

40:52.575 --> 40:56.921
Alan, did you ever imagine
what life would be like in your 50s?

40:57.205 --> 40:59.879
I had hopes and dreams.
I think we all did.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.635
Penny for them.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.217
Keep the penny,
you've got a gun.

41:05.380 --> 41:08.975
But, yeah, I used to dream that one day
I'd drive a brand-new Range Rover

41:09.133 --> 41:10.976
towing a speed boat.

41:11.135 --> 41:14.309
I used to dream about growing old
with someone I love.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.982
Hm. Both valid.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.235
It's not gonna happen now, is it?

41:24.816 --> 41:26.864
I miss my Molly so much.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.999
- Who's this chap?
- That's Molly.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.376
Yes, of course.

41:37.745 --> 41:40.624
She's got such.. brown hair.

41:43.209 --> 41:46.884
A year after that was
taken, the angels took her.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.551

41:51.718 --> 41:54.642

No wife.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.440
No family. No kids.

42:02.562 --> 42:04.735
I've gotta say, Pat, kids
don't make you happy.

42:04.897 --> 42:08.151
Some of the unhappiest times of my life
have been with my kids.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.365
I remember..

42:10.528 --> 42:13.407
a holiday on the
beach in Prestatyn.

42:13.656 --> 42:18.287
The kids came over to me and said,
"Papa, Papa!! Follow me,"

42:18.453 --> 42:20.547
and.. you know..

42:21.039 --> 42:23.918
I followed them about 200 yards
across the sand dunes.

42:24.083 --> 42:28.008

all they'd done was dug a big hole.

42:29.797 --> 42:31.390

was Molly's favourite too.

44:22.535 --> 44:25.960

48:27.446 --> 48:29.665
<b>Move into position, over.</b>

48:30.116 --> 48:32.039

48:32.201 --> 48:35.375

turn, we've hit the motherload.

48:35.579 --> 48:39.174
Oblong plate, square bowl. Go figure.
Whatever happened to circles?

48:39.333 --> 48:41.711
I mean I've heard of a square meal
but that's ridiculous.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.921

I've heard of a square meal.

48:44.088 --> 48:45.590
Alan!! Alan!! Ssh, ssh.

48:45.756 --> 48:46.882
OK.

48:47.091 --> 48:49.185
- We think it's the police.
- Wait.

48:50.052 --> 48:52.805
- That definitely came from in there.
- That's just a cupboard.

48:52.972 --> 48:54.690
- It's not even an outside wall.
- Careful.

48:54.849 --> 48:57.227
- No, Jason..
- I'll protect you.

48:57.435 --> 49:00.985
It's not an outside wall.
Look, I'll show you. Look.

49:03.149 --> 49:04.992
- Michael?
- Aye, aye, Mister Partridge.

49:05.151 --> 49:06.573
What are you hiding in there for?

49:06.735 --> 49:09.864
I found myself a place of concealment,
like when I was on manoeuvres.

49:10.072 --> 49:12.871
Take your light off.
You're blinding everyone you speak to.

49:13.033 --> 49:14.501
- Now it's flashing.
- Sorry.

49:15.411 --> 49:19.257
Michael. You look like some
sort of big Geordie Anne Frank.

49:19.457 --> 49:21.585
- How long have you been here?
- All night.

49:21.750 --> 49:23.351
- What did you eat?
- I had me lunch box.

49:23.461 --> 49:25.134
- Where did you go to the toilet?
- No.

49:25.296 --> 49:27.173
I had me lunch box.

49:27.339 --> 49:29.717
Thank God it's got a smoky finish
with an airtight seal.

49:29.925 --> 49:31.768
I tell you what. It
seals in the freshness.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.097
No, Michael. It seals out the freshness.

49:34.263 --> 49:35.810
What is going on in here?

49:35.973 --> 49:38.226
Michael's just visiting
us from the cupboard.

49:38.392 --> 49:39.609
No need to get shouty-shouty.

49:39.768 --> 49:42.066
Did those Goredale bastards
put you up to this?

49:42.229 --> 49:44.903
<b>- No.

49:45.065 --> 49:46.783

A few nights this week

49:48.944 --> 49:51.038
- Why?
- Me brother wanted the bed to himself.

49:51.197 --> 49:53.120
Ah, yes.
Michael suffers from night terrors.

49:53.282 --> 49:54.875
He thrashes about like a big salmon.

49:55.034 --> 49:56.377
What's in the box?

49:57.203 --> 50:00.127
Er.. Michael.. Michael
let himself down.

50:03.167 --> 50:05.465
I'm really sorry.
I done a shit in the box.

50:06.003 --> 50:08.722
Well, get rid of it.
Throw it out the window.

50:11.759 --> 50:13.761

I haven't been off the TV that long.

50:25.940 --> 50:29.069
- "Identify yourself."
- Alan, it's OK, I'm here. You're safe.

50:29.235 --> 50:31.488
Yeah, tell them to stop
pointing their guns at me.

50:31.654 --> 50:34.658

- Yeah, lower your weapons.

50:35.991 --> 50:39.120
Take your hand off your gun.
Take your hand off your gun.

50:39.286 --> 50:41.664

I can wait here all day.

50:41.872 --> 50:43.374
<b>Do as he says.</b>

50:43.541 --> 50:46.135
Thank you. Why do you have to
turn it into a competition?

50:46.293 --> 50:48.512
Just because I won. OK.

50:48.671 --> 50:50.344
OK. Stop. Pat, stop tugging me.

50:50.506 --> 50:52.349
I told you I've got a
very sensitive tummy.

50:52.508 --> 50:53.680
Who are you talking to, Alan?

50:53.842 --> 50:55.890
I've got Pat on the end of
the line in both senses.

50:56.053 --> 50:58.772
I'm tethered to the building via
this rope and relaying messages

50:58.931 --> 51:02.231
from Pat via this state-of-the-art
Sennheiser 1,000 head set.

51:02.393 --> 51:04.441
Nice bit of kit. Yeah, I'm
telling them that now.

51:04.603 --> 51:06.651
If you'd listened, you'd
know I'm telling them.

51:06.814 --> 51:10.318
- Pat says “Hi".
- Hi, Pat.

51:10.484 --> 51:12.578
And hi to your fellow officers.

51:13.195 --> 51:15.163
Hi. Hi, Pat.

51:15.364 --> 51:19.460
Alan, listen. Pat works with us here,
this can all end well. OK?

51:19.618 --> 51:21.179
<b>- I give him my word.
- OK, just.. Yep.</b>

51:21.328 --> 51:23.456
OK. Pat, you've got to..
you're rambling.

51:23.664 --> 51:26.713
You've got to be more concise.
What do you want? “I want a helicopter."

51:26.917 --> 51:29.011
That's just an example, by the way.

51:30.337 --> 51:31.884
Yeah, OK. He wants a helicopter.

51:32.089 --> 51:34.217
<b>That might not
be possible, Alan.</b>

51:34.383 --> 51:37.057
<b>But let's dialogue.
What else can we do for him?</b>

51:43.892 --> 51:47.066
Pat says, "Fucking stupid pigs.
What the hell's going on?"

51:47.229 --> 51:50.199
Pat, listen to me. That
was not an attack, OK?

51:50.357 --> 51:53.827
We just had to dispose of a box around
the corner in a controlled manner.

51:54.028 --> 51:56.229
Pat would prefer it if you
spoke through me, as would I.

51:56.363 --> 51:59.833
Marlin says they deployed
a remote RV fitted with a disruptor

51:59.992 --> 52:04.122
to neutralise a suspected IED. He doesn't know
what you're talking about. He's quite angry.

52:04.288 --> 52:07.258
He's honking in my ear
like a mad Irish goose.

52:07.416 --> 52:09.293
- Aha!!
- We love you, Alan!!

52:09.460 --> 52:11.929
Um.. do you mind? It's
not a radio road show.

52:12.087 --> 52:15.512
<b>- I'm trying to host a siege here.
- We love you, Alan!!</b>

52:15.674 --> 52:18.223
Get away. Who said that?

52:18.594 --> 52:19.811
What's it like in there?

52:19.970 --> 52:23.850
Ah.. scary, stressful, lots of shouting.

52:24.558 --> 52:27.107
A bit like being married again.

52:27.603 --> 52:30.026
And there's a crazy person
running around with a gun.

52:30.189 --> 52:33.113
So it's a lot like being married again.

52:33.275 --> 52:38.702
And er.. when I saw a guy with a shotgun
in his mouth begging for mercy then..

52:38.906 --> 52:40.954
You're ahead of me.

52:41.116 --> 52:42.596
You're ahead of me. A lot of you are.

52:42.743 --> 52:45.542
He's still got his hand on his gun.
He thinks I don't know. Yeah, you.

52:45.704 --> 52:47.957
- I'm looking at you. Peripheral vision.
- Alan.

52:48.123 --> 52:50.467
I'm not retreating,
Pat's tugging me off.

52:50.626 --> 52:51.843
No, come on.

52:52.002 --> 52:54.630
- We're better than that. Guys, seriously.
- Alan, wait!!

52:54.797 --> 52:57.641

59:17.429 --> 59:19.602
To get back on track, erm..

59:19.806 --> 59:21.683
Yeah, I mean.. Yeah, whoo!!

59:22.267 --> 59:24.690
<b>- I like you.
- I like you.</b>

59:24.853 --> 59:26.901
He likes me, Lynn. Jason
Tresswell likes me.

59:27.064 --> 59:28.744
- Alan? Are you OK?
- I've got to be quick.

59:28.899 --> 59:31.197
Pat thinks I've borrowed his phone
to play Angry Birds.

59:31.401 --> 59:34.029
- Of course. What is it?
- A computerised bird-throwing game.

59:34.196 --> 59:36.369
<b>- No, I meant..
- I'm joking, Lynn.</b>

59:36.573 --> 59:38.416
Enjoy me. Everyone else is.

59:38.617 --> 59:41.166
Goredale Media think
I'm some sort of Christ 2.0.

59:41.328 --> 59:44.582
Do you know, I'm within a brair's headth
of getting the breakfast show.

59:44.748 --> 59:47.217
I'll call myself the Morning Rooster,
or the Talking Cock.

59:47.375 --> 59:49.844
- You're not thinking clearly.
- Yes, I am.

59:50.003 --> 59:51.846
Lynn, I'll say this once
and I'll say it again.

59:52.005 --> 59:55.635
My career's getting a shot in the arm and
if I can stay in here to the bitter end,

59:55.801 --> 59:59.647
I will be the biggest thing to come out
of Norwich since.. Lord Nelson or Trisha.

59:59.805 --> 1:00:01.352
Think about that and what that means.

1:00:01.515 --> 1:00:03.734
Your priority is the
welfare of the hostages.

1:00:03.892 --> 1:00:05.894
Good - put that out as a press release
and say I said it.

1:00:06.061 --> 1:00:08.189
Alan, your ego's getting
the better of you.

1:00:08.355 --> 1:00:11.825
I've just got to stay alert and focused.
I'm playing them like an oboe, Lynn.

1:00:12.025 --> 1:00:14.119
How effed up is that?

1:00:15.362 --> 1:00:17.410
<b>- Alan? Alan?
- Oh..</b>

1:00:39.678 --> 1:00:42.101
Ohh!! Christ's sake.

1:00:46.101 --> 1:00:48.229
Not now. Oh, God.

1:00:49.229 --> 1:00:51.323
I'm caught on the latch.

1:01:04.411 --> 1:01:06.254
Oh, come on. Please.

1:01:15.881 --> 1:01:19.511
Stop, armed police!!
Get your hands above your head.

1:01:19.676 --> 1:01:22.099
<b>- I've just got..
- Get your hands above your head!!</b>

1:01:22.262 --> 1:01:24.765
- I want to get those trousers.
- Do it!! Hands above your head.

1:01:24.931 --> 1:01:28.356
- They're my trousers.
- Get your hands above your head now!!

1:01:32.314 --> 1:01:34.567
What are you doing? It's weird.

1:01:36.193 --> 1:01:37.911
There are paparazzi all over the place

1:01:38.069 --> 1:01:40.822
and I do not want them
to get a photograph of my genitals.

1:01:42.949 --> 1:01:46.499
- Oh, come on!!
- That's it, look at me.

1:01:53.376 --> 1:01:55.674
And how were the hostages when you left?

1:01:56.588 --> 1:01:58.966
- Crouched.
- I mean, what's their state of mind?

1:01:59.132 --> 1:02:02.853
Oh. Er.. If I'm honest, a bit moany.
Yeah. Is someone writing this down?

1:02:03.011 --> 1:02:05.355
<b>- Yeah.
- Sorry. I thought you were some clothes.</b>

1:02:05.513 --> 1:02:07.982
Thanks for the forensic
trousers, by the way.

1:02:08.642 --> 1:02:10.644
- Could you just um..?
- Crikey. Yeah, sorry.

1:02:10.810 --> 1:02:14.360
I was actually going to fashion a
sort of make-shift modesty sporran

1:02:14.522 --> 1:02:16.695
from the vacant arm flaps.

1:02:21.154 --> 1:02:24.249
OK, I think we're done here.

1:02:24.407 --> 1:02:28.332
Any chance of freshening up? I just need
to wipe my face with a big hot towel.

1:02:28.495 --> 1:02:31.499
Presumably you wanna use me
as part of your media strat?

1:02:33.708 --> 1:02:34.800
No.

1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:36.337
- Do you agree?
- 100 per cent.

1:02:36.503 --> 1:02:37.675
Gotcha.

1:02:38.380 --> 1:02:41.930
The police said you could do media
interviews when the siege is over.

1:02:42.092 --> 1:02:47.019
It will be too late then, Lynn. People
move on. Goredale Media will move on.

1:02:47.931 --> 1:02:49.933
But you're still being talked about.

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:53.695
Only cos every time I look at the telly,
they're showing a picture of my arse.

1:02:53.895 --> 1:02:57.274
It's all right for you. Every other time I
look, they show a picture of your face.

1:02:57.440 --> 1:03:00.489
And then the next time -
surprise, surprise, my arse again.

1:03:00.652 --> 1:03:02.495
I was only telling people about you.

1:03:02.654 --> 1:03:08.252
You know, I was Goredale's golden goose,
and now I'm just Partridge pie, with peas.

1:03:08.410 --> 1:03:10.833
But why do you want to work
for people like that?

1:03:10.996 --> 1:03:13.670
- Goredale are bullies.
- Yeah. And what do you do with a bully?

1:03:13.873 --> 1:03:16.877
You make friends with the bully
so they bully someone else.

1:03:17.502 --> 1:03:19.880
- "What doth it profit a man.."
- Doth?

1:03:20.130 --> 1:03:24.351
"..If he gains the whole world yet loses
his soul?" Matthew, chapter eight..

1:03:24.509 --> 1:03:27.638
Yeah, I know who wrote it.
I'm not going to sell my soul, Lynn.

1:03:27.804 --> 1:03:32.355
I want to, if you like,
lend my soul to Goredale Media

1:03:32.559 --> 1:03:34.152
on a long-term basis for cash.

1:03:34.311 --> 1:03:36.234
It's a very different thing.

1:03:40.984 --> 1:03:42.944
I don't know how
you can look yourself in the eye.

1:03:43.111 --> 1:03:44.613
I can't, Lynn. My nose is in the way.

1:03:44.779 --> 1:03:46.952
You can talk,
prattling away on every news bulletin.

1:03:47.157 --> 1:03:49.501
I mean, who the heck
do you think you are?

1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:54.623
- I'm Lynn Benfield.
- You don't look like Lynn Benfield.

1:03:54.789 --> 1:03:58.168
I mean, what has happened to you,
with your attitude and your hair?

1:03:58.335 --> 1:04:00.087
You've literally become a big head.

1:04:01.296 --> 1:04:03.719
- I like it.
- I take no pleasure in saying this, Lynn,

1:04:03.923 --> 1:04:07.177
but a lot of people think it looks
like a photograph of an explosion.

1:04:08.636 --> 1:04:10.596
I don't know if I want to
work for a man like you.

1:04:10.722 --> 1:04:13.726
I don't know that I want to employ
someone who looks like a madam.

1:04:13.892 --> 1:04:15.235
And I don't mean a Parisian one -

1:04:15.435 --> 1:04:18.484
I mean, one who lives in a terraced
house behind a train station.

1:04:32.452 --> 1:04:35.706
- Doors opening!!
- Armed police!! Armed police!!

1:04:35.872 --> 1:04:39.046
Oh, shut up, will you?
Stop shouting.

1:04:39.209 --> 1:04:42.509
- Easy, Pat. Mind the steps.
- I'm able to walk down steps, all right?

1:04:42.670 --> 1:04:44.718
He means because the gun's
against my head.

1:04:45.131 --> 1:04:48.852
- Everybody has an opinion, huh?
- Hear, hear. Well said.

1:04:49.052 --> 1:04:51.100
- On.
- Hi, Pat.

1:04:51.262 --> 1:04:53.765
Hey, Alan. What happened?
We were in the middle of a show,

1:04:53.932 --> 1:04:55.809
and then your arse is all
over the internet.

1:04:55.975 --> 1:04:58.398
Looked like you had a turkey's head
between your legs.

1:04:58.561 --> 1:05:00.859
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.
It doesn't have a beak.

1:05:01.022 --> 1:05:03.070
And, yeah, I took an executive decision

1:05:03.233 --> 1:05:05.656
to stow my cock and balls up
against my backside.

1:05:05.860 --> 1:05:08.158
I can't believe you left
me with this nutcase.

1:05:08.321 --> 1:05:10.289
Hang on a minute, you're
the one with the gun.

1:05:10.448 --> 1:05:13.076
- See? He's hilarious.
- He's solid. He's solid.

1:05:13.243 --> 1:05:17.623
- Pizzas coming through now, Pat.
- Hey. Hey, hey. Hold on. Helmet off.

1:05:24.671 --> 1:05:26.514
Oh, hello.

1:05:29.175 --> 1:05:31.428
Actually, I want Alan to bring them in.

1:05:33.763 --> 1:05:37.267
That might not be possible, Pat.
Alan's not prepared to do that.

1:05:37.434 --> 1:05:39.482
No.. I am prepared to do that.

1:05:39.644 --> 1:05:42.193
<b>- It's not that simple.
- Do you want me to release some people?</b>

1:05:42.397 --> 1:05:43.865
Sure. Let's talk about that.

1:05:44.023 --> 1:05:46.151
Alan, what do you reckon
if I let the women go?

1:05:46.317 --> 1:05:49.321
Yeah, let a couple of the women go.
Maybe keep Angela.

1:05:49.904 --> 1:05:52.498
<b>- But her kids will be worried sick.
- She's got kids?</b>

1:05:52.699 --> 1:05:55.498
Yeah. Two boys, 14 and 15.

1:05:56.494 --> 1:05:57.996
I believe they're a real handful.

1:05:58.163 --> 1:06:01.133
Yeah, what was I thinking?
Let all the women go.

1:06:01.291 --> 1:06:03.259
Pat, give me five minutes
with head office.

1:06:03.418 --> 1:06:05.887
He's bringing them in now.
Alan, come on.

1:06:06.546 --> 1:06:08.173
- Top one.
- Top one.

1:06:08.381 --> 1:06:11.601
- Yeah, yeah, cheers, guys. Top one.
- OK, come on, son.

1:06:12.969 --> 1:06:14.721
Oh, shit.

1:06:18.558 --> 1:06:20.526
Why did you say hello
to that delivery guy?

1:06:21.644 --> 1:06:26.445
Oh, him? No, he just reminded me
of a man I know called Mike Cable,

1:06:26.608 --> 1:06:30.704
who did my accounts from '97 to '98.

1:06:30.862 --> 1:06:32.614
Actually, no. '99.

1:06:32.780 --> 1:06:34.999
Till he stopped
because his daughter was very ill.

1:06:35.158 --> 1:06:36.910
Yeah, it was touch and go, actually.

1:06:37.368 --> 1:06:40.247
He and Sandra were in bits,
they had to cancel their holiday.

1:06:40.872 --> 1:06:43.000
- It was a fly-drive to Tuscany.
- Hm.

1:06:43.166 --> 1:06:46.796
I must tell him, actually, that there's
a policeman that looks just like him.

1:06:47.170 --> 1:06:48.217
What's that?

1:06:48.379 --> 1:06:51.349
Must tell Mike that there's a pizza man
who looks just like him.

1:06:53.009 --> 1:06:54.682
I'm famished.

1:06:57.555 --> 1:06:59.432
- Ladies, you're free to go.
- What?

1:06:59.641 --> 1:07:01.814
- Yep.
- God bless you, Pat.

1:07:01.976 --> 1:07:03.102
See you. Bye.

1:07:03.269 --> 1:07:05.317
I'll make you a home-made pizza
when you get out.

1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:07.232
Yeah, these pizzas are pretty good.

1:07:10.151 --> 1:07:11.573
- Cinderella.
- Yeah, well..

1:07:11.736 --> 1:07:14.239
No, hers was.. that was
a glass one, wasn't it?

1:07:16.366 --> 1:07:17.993
Here comes the Tin Man.

1:07:27.544 --> 1:07:30.798
- Just trying to find your pizza.
- Well, just give me that one.

1:07:32.173 --> 1:07:33.641
- Hm?
- That one.

1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:35.473
- Which one?
- The top one.

1:07:37.262 --> 1:07:38.889
Oh..

1:07:39.097 --> 1:07:41.065
- I'll take the pizzas.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1:07:44.769 --> 1:07:48.114
Woo-ho, stuffed crust!!
- Thanks for coming back, Alan.

1:07:50.733 --> 1:07:52.952
- What are you doing?
- I'm just seeing how you'll look

1:07:53.111 --> 1:07:56.115
on the billboard for when you start
on The Breakfast Show.

1:07:56.281 --> 1:07:59.285
- The Breakfast Show?
- Alan, can I have a word?

1:07:59.450 --> 1:08:02.624
Yeah, sure.
Just bringing the pizza cutter.

1:08:03.955 --> 1:08:05.923
Right, how many do you want.
Six or eight?

1:08:06.082 --> 1:08:07.800
Oh, my God, that's a taser!!

1:08:07.959 --> 1:08:11.054
This is no use, it's a pizza cutter.
And that is not a pizza.

1:08:11.713 --> 1:08:14.933
Thing is, how did it get there?
Erm..

1:08:15.425 --> 1:08:19.146
Unless the pizza company are running
a competition in which you win a taser.

1:08:19.304 --> 1:08:22.353
That doesn't make sense, does it?
Do you realise, it's the police?

1:08:22.515 --> 1:08:26.611
<b>The ruddy po.. Do you know.. They've got
some brass neck for a bunch of coppers.</b>

1:08:26.769 --> 1:08:28.487
I'm actually really angry about that.

1:08:28.646 --> 1:08:30.740
You should keep that as an extra weapon.

1:08:30.898 --> 1:08:34.994
What kind of fool do you take me for, eh?
I'm one step ahead of all of you.

1:08:35.153 --> 1:08:37.281
And I'm just a step behind you, mate.

1:08:38.031 --> 1:08:40.409
- Ooh.
- Never take your eye off the ball, Pat.

1:08:40.575 --> 1:08:41.792
First rule of business.

1:08:41.993 --> 1:08:44.746
Second rule of business,
always be prepared for an opportunity

1:08:44.912 --> 1:08:47.631
when it arises, like I was just then.

1:08:47.790 --> 1:08:48.757
Yeah.

1:08:48.916 --> 1:08:52.386
Course I wouldn't expect you to
understand that. It's Darwinian.

1:08:53.171 --> 1:08:56.175
<b>- You're a runt.
- Is that what you think, Alan?</b>

1:08:58.009 --> 1:09:00.353
I wouldn't quite, you
know, use those words.

1:09:00.511 --> 1:09:02.229
Well, I think.. I think..

1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:04.557
The sort of the gist
of what, you know..

1:09:04.724 --> 1:09:06.397
I just don't like bullies.

1:09:07.435 --> 1:09:10.860
- Um.. can I take this off, please?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

1:09:11.022 --> 1:09:13.901
- No, I'm talking to him.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

1:09:14.067 --> 1:09:15.785
<b>- Yeah, go ahead.
- Thank you.</b>

1:09:16.736 --> 1:09:18.158
Are you all right?

1:09:18.321 --> 1:09:21.700
Well, I was worried about the old head
but I think I've got a handle on it.

1:09:22.784 --> 1:09:25.128
- Very witty.
- Alan's a smart cookie, Pat.

1:09:26.704 --> 1:09:30.629
He's treated this whole crisis
like a business opportunity.

1:09:30.792 --> 1:09:35.514
He's taken a look around him and he's
thought, "How can I make this work for me?"

1:09:36.464 --> 1:09:38.307
- Well done, Alan.
- Cheers.

1:09:38.466 --> 1:09:40.889
- Yeah, well done, Alan.
- Thank you.

1:09:41.552 --> 1:09:44.101
You know, you and me,
we've got something going here.

1:09:44.263 --> 1:09:48.609
Pat might be a dinosaur, filling his show
with chit-chat and phone-ins like it's 1983,

1:09:48.810 --> 1:09:49.902
but you're one of us.

1:09:50.061 --> 1:09:53.065
You know radio's just business.
You'll do well out of this.

1:09:53.231 --> 1:09:55.905
And er.. I'll get you a glamorous
assistant with big tits

1:09:56.109 --> 1:09:59.534
to take over from that frumpy old cow
you've got at the moment.

1:09:59.696 --> 1:10:01.414
You know, Mrs fucking Doubtfire.

1:10:04.450 --> 1:10:07.545
Danny, er..
Jason gave me your breakfast show.

1:10:08.579 --> 1:10:10.206
- Yeah.
- Is that true?

1:10:10.373 --> 1:10:12.046
- Well..
- Twat.

1:10:14.502 --> 1:10:16.049
Oh, my God.

1:10:16.212 --> 1:10:17.839
Go!! Go!! Go!!

1:10:19.924 --> 1:10:21.847
Armed police!!

1:10:22.009 --> 1:10:24.432
Armed police!! Everybody stay down!!

1:10:24.595 --> 1:10:28.190

has changed you.

1:23:57.074 --> 1:23:58.792
I think I have changed a little bit.

1:23:58.951 --> 1:24:01.329
Well, for my part,
I was a bit worried about my head..

1:24:01.495 --> 1:24:02.712
- Here we go.
- But um..

1:24:02.913 --> 1:24:06.634
- I think I've got a handle on it now.
- Oh, yeah, that's a good joke.

1:24:07.334 --> 1:24:09.757
You've used that joke
about three or four times now.

1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:12.343
- I don't know if you're aware of that.
- I use it too much?

1:24:12.506 --> 1:24:16.010
I wouldn't say that. I just think
we're in that area and.. you know.

1:24:16.176 --> 1:24:18.178
- What about the hat?
- Good for the bin, I reckon.

1:24:18.345 --> 1:24:20.143
- Lose it?
- Yeah.

1:24:20.305 --> 1:24:23.058
But I think, like you say,
you're coming on leaps and bounds..

1:24:23.225 --> 1:24:24.568
and I think, 12 months' time,

1:24:24.726 --> 1:24:27.229
you'll probably have forgotten
there ever was a siege.

1:24:27.396 --> 1:24:29.569
- What siege?
- Er.. exactly. That's good.

1:24:29.731 --> 1:24:32.075
- You haven't really forgotten?
- No.

1:24:32.734 --> 1:24:36.955
OK, time now for our weekly phone call
with incarcerated DJ Pat Farrell.

OK, this week's question comes from Sue,
a dental hygienist from Grantham.

1:24:49.084 --> 1:24:52.179
She asks, "Prison time is
often referred to as porridge

1:24:52.337 --> 1:24:57.389
but do they actually serve porridge,
and if so, is it compulsory?"

1:24:57.551 --> 1:25:00.725
<b>Yeah, they serve porridge
but you can have other things.</b>

1:25:00.887 --> 1:25:04.061

for you next week, until then..
