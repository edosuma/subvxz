00:02.735 --> 00:05.024
E. R.

00:07.189 --> 00:09.066
- Elmira.
- Mexico?

00:09.233 --> 00:12.487
Upstate New York. Chloe stayed
in a motel there for two weeks.

00:12.654 --> 00:15.365
- The cops told you?
- It showed up on Joe's credit-card bill.

00:15.532 --> 00:18.410
- Who's Joe?
- Her husband. Or ex-husband.

00:18.577 --> 00:20.830
- He's driving up there.
- Can you hold that?

00:21.038 --> 00:22.082
E. R. 8x20 "THE LETTER"

00:22.249 --> 00:24.501
- Is it numb, Mr. Cannillo?
- My whole face is numb.

00:24.668 --> 00:28.714
Maybe I should too. God knows what
she's doing. Suzy needs to be in school.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.968
Got it. Okay, watch that
back cast next time, Mr. Cannillo.

00:32.177 --> 00:35.763
Chloe could lose her in a heartbeat,
and we might not be so lucky again.

00:35.931 --> 00:38.183
- I need the Wooly Bugger back.
- On the tray.

00:38.392 --> 00:40.644
You could have her declared
an unfit mother.

00:40.811 --> 00:43.439
- Then Joe gets Suzy.
- If he wants her.

00:43.648 --> 00:45.608
- I don't know.
- Hey, lady!

00:45.775 --> 00:47.235
Where in the hell's my leg?

00:47.444 --> 00:50.990
- I believe it was amputated.
- Not the real one, moron. My prosthetic.

00:51.156 --> 00:52.826
You had one when you came in, Toby?

00:52.909 --> 00:54.786
Yes. She took it. Give it back.

00:54.953 --> 00:57.497
- Why would I want your leg?
- You tell me, pervert.

00:57.705 --> 00:58.916
Can you describe the leg?

00:58.998 --> 01:01.418
Looks just like this one, only it's plastic.

01:01.585 --> 01:05.340
We'll see if we can get you one.
Haleh, fly fisher needs a tetanus shot.

01:05.506 --> 01:08.593
Check central supply,
see if we have extra orthopedic legs.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.805
Somebody stole Toby's leg again.

01:11.722 --> 01:14.475
- Thanks for defending me.
- The guy needs a free leg.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.645
You got both of yours.

01:17.019 --> 01:20.440
- Is the server down again?
- Half-hour. We're loading new software.

01:20.607 --> 01:23.318
Did we get the LP results
back on Jessup?

01:23.486 --> 01:26.989
- You know where the fax machine is?
- Frank, did a match letter come?

01:27.198 --> 01:28.617
Do I look like the postmaster?

01:28.699 --> 01:30.660
Match letters are at the dean's office.

01:30.828 --> 01:34.665
I know that, genius. I forgot
to pick it up. They said they sent it here.

01:34.832 --> 01:37.085
- You forgot to pick it up?
- I had a date.

01:37.252 --> 01:39.045
- Hey, when did this come in?
- What?

01:39.212 --> 01:40.672
This letter. Dr. Greene.

01:40.755 --> 01:42.800
Stick it in his box.
I'll mail it to his home.

01:42.967 --> 01:44.969
- No, it's from Dr. Greene.
- To who?

01:45.135 --> 01:47.555
- Everyone, I guess.
- What's it say?

01:47.721 --> 01:50.267
- It says, "Dear ER gang... "
- We're a gang now?

01:50.474 --> 01:53.687
- Got a secret handshake and everything.
- While you were in Phoenix.

01:53.854 --> 01:56.023
- Go on, Carter.
- "Dear ER gang:

01:56.190 --> 01:59.485
So here I am out on the beach
at 5:30 in the evening.

01:59.652 --> 02:03.532
Elizabeth is sitting with me drinking juice,
but I'm all about the mai tais. "

02:03.699 --> 02:05.867
- What's he reading?
- Dr. Greene's letter.

02:06.034 --> 02:09.789
"The sun is going down. Rachel
is dipping Ella's toes in the ocean...

02:09.997 --> 02:13.376
...as they head off on a quest
for the perfect seashell. "

02:13.669 --> 02:16.922
- "Wish you were here" would've done it.
- He doesn't have to rub it in.

02:17.422 --> 02:19.467
"would make this moment complete?

02:19.551 --> 02:21.010
Some jogger dropping to the sand...

02:21.219 --> 02:24.264
...short of breath, so I can swoop in
with a piece of bamboo...

02:24.431 --> 02:26.934
- ... to perform a nice, clean intubation...
- What's this?

02:27.101 --> 02:29.228
- Mark.
- ... fix the guy up and send him off...

02:29.436 --> 02:31.146
...with a good simple dispo. "

02:31.356 --> 02:34.943
The day I start fantasizing about
critical procedures is the day I leave too.

02:35.110 --> 02:37.405
"Which is my way of saying
that I miss you all...

02:37.529 --> 02:38.698
...and that dingy place."

02:38.864 --> 02:40.658
- Want another five of-?
- Dr. Greene.

02:40.825 --> 02:43.912
"Lots of times, I thought I should have
chosen a different career...

02:44.078 --> 02:46.331
...or gone into private practice.

02:46.414 --> 02:49.335
Something easier, less grinding,
more lucrative.

02:49.501 --> 02:50.919
But since I've been gone,

02:51.003 --> 02:54.216
I realize outside of what
I'm doing right now...

02:54.382 --> 02:56.593
...sitting on this beach with my family...

02:56.760 --> 03:01.641
...staying at County all those years
doing what we do on a daily basis...

03:02.642 --> 03:04.852
...was the best choice I ever made.

03:05.812 --> 03:07.606
I know what you're thinking. Trust me,

03:07.690 --> 03:10.275
it's not hard to appreciate once it's over."

03:10.442 --> 03:12.778
I think that's the mai tais talking.

03:12.945 --> 03:14.363
Shut up. Keep reading.

03:14.531 --> 03:16.533
"As much as part of me
would like to believe the ER...

03:16.616 --> 03:18.536
...can't go on without me...

03:18.701 --> 03:20.371
...the smarter part realizes that...

03:20.454 --> 03:22.873
...you're an incredible group
of doctors and nurses...

03:23.040 --> 03:27.254
...who approach every day with such skill,
compassion and thoroughness.

03:27.462 --> 03:31.843
And when it comes to patient care,
I know my absence will hardly be felt."

03:32.634 --> 03:34.595
I'm not so sure of that.

03:34.762 --> 03:38.015
"As for friendship and camaraderie,
well, that's another matter.

03:38.182 --> 03:41.561
In order to leave,
I had to go the way I did.

03:41.770 --> 03:47.610
But I wouldn't want any of you to think
that meant I didn't value each of you...

03:47.819 --> 03:50.155
...and the years
that we worked together...

03:50.322 --> 03:54.159
...or that I didn't have things
of a more personal nature to say.

03:54.868 --> 03:58.957
Most of you, I think, have an idea
of what those things might be...

03:59.124 --> 04:02.086
...without me writing them down.
But still... "

04:04.505 --> 04:06.090
Go on.

04:06.590 --> 04:08.801
There's just a couple dots and then:

04:08.969 --> 04:13.765
"Ella is laughing and waving for me.
Rachel's found her shell. "

04:15.101 --> 04:16.351
Nothing else?

04:16.519 --> 04:19.188
Probably jammed. Damn machine's
been on the fritz all week.

04:19.397 --> 04:22.149
- Is there a transmission report?
- So he faxes the letter...

04:22.359 --> 04:25.446
...so he doesn't have to send
the macadamia nuts.

04:25.863 --> 04:28.324
What? What is it?

04:34.038 --> 04:35.999
This is from Dr. Corday.

04:44.425 --> 04:46.637
"Mark died this morning...

04:47.845 --> 04:49.390
...at 6:04 a. m.

04:51.518 --> 04:53.436
The sun was rising...

04:53.979 --> 04:55.772
...his favorite time of day.

04:58.233 --> 05:01.946
I sent this on so that you might know
he was thinking of you all...

05:02.238 --> 05:03.949
...and that...

05:04.616 --> 05:06.702
...he appre-

05:07.035 --> 05:10.039
He appreciated knowing
you would remember him well."

05:28.811 --> 05:31.105
Post it on the floor, Frank.

05:31.272 --> 05:33.148
That last part?

05:33.440 --> 05:34.602
The whole thing.

07:01.512 --> 07:03.556
It ain't my heart.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.976
Cold, that's all.

07:06.477 --> 07:08.812
And I need some of that breathing stuff.

07:08.979 --> 07:11.105
BP's 100/76.

07:11.273 --> 07:13.108
Sally bolus?

07:14.151 --> 07:17.488
- Sally?
- Bolus normal saline, start an insulin drip.

07:17.697 --> 07:19.657
- Work him up first.
- Where's my cart?

07:19.824 --> 07:23.453
- CBC, lytes, BUN, creatinine.
- Wait, he's a brittle diabetic in DKA.

07:23.620 --> 07:26.122
- We need to lower his sugar.
- You don't know his sugar.

07:26.290 --> 07:27.750
Get Dr. Greene. He knows what to do.

07:27.916 --> 07:29.543
Mr. Ervin, he's not here today.

07:29.710 --> 07:30.795
Then I'll come back later.

07:30.961 --> 07:32.797
No. You might have fluid in your lungs.

07:33.005 --> 07:35.217
- And you have a high fever.
- Fever?

07:35.382 --> 07:37.052
I'm colder than that hawk out there
on a windy day.

07:37.135 --> 07:38.678
...Chest X-Ray, cardiac enzimes.

07:38.845 --> 07:41.348
- DKA, I'm telling you.
- Send up LFTs.

07:41.514 --> 07:45.019
- You want his bank statements also?
- Last time someone stole my dictionary.

07:45.226 --> 07:47.563
Bet 20 he's over 400.

07:47.730 --> 07:49.857
Dr. Carter?

07:50.900 --> 07:54.905
- What?
- Twenty bucks says glucose is over 400.

07:56.406 --> 07:58.867
Just plug him in.

08:01.537 --> 08:03.498
Dr. Weaver?

08:06.417 --> 08:08.544
Dr. Weaver?

08:10.171 --> 08:12.965
When did this get-?

08:13.133 --> 08:15.052
You were at lunch.

08:18.264 --> 08:21.976
And you felt the need to post it
on the bulletin board?

08:23.186 --> 08:26.273
Well, he wrote it to the ER.

08:29.526 --> 08:31.904
- Do you want us to take it down?
- No.

08:32.071 --> 08:34.657
- Double MVA coming. Father, daughter.
- Carter and Lewis.

08:34.823 --> 08:37.577
- And George cut himself again.
- In a minute.

08:38.203 --> 08:41.623
Auto versus cement truck. 10-year-old,
unrestrained back-seat passenger...

08:41.789 --> 08:45.503
- ...flew to the front, hit deployed air bag.
- I'm Dr. Lewis. What's your name?

08:45.668 --> 08:47.755
- Melissa.
- Melissa, were you knocked out?

08:47.922 --> 08:49.048
- No.
- Does it hurt?

08:49.130 --> 08:50.216
- My chest.
- Dan Rue,

08:50.341 --> 08:52.359
36-year-old restrained driver.

08:52.563 --> 08:55.596
Throat to steering wheel, knee
to dashboard, with hip and pelvis pain.

08:55.764 --> 08:57.390
- LOC?
- No. GCS, 13.

08:57.599 --> 09:01.227
- Can you tell me where it hurts most?
- Right leg and my throat.

09:01.395 --> 09:03.439
All right. Page Surgery.
Tell RT to get the heliox.

09:03.563 --> 09:05.023
Has his voice changed much?

09:05.191 --> 09:07.026
- Maybe a little.
- Is my daughter here?

09:07.818 --> 09:10.196
- Tachy at 108.
- Full trauma panel.

09:10.364 --> 09:12.031
Follow the light with your eyes.

09:12.199 --> 09:13.491
- BP?
- Cycling.

09:14.117 --> 09:16.453
- Melissa, did you hurt your neck at all?
- No.

09:16.620 --> 09:18.331
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

09:18.497 --> 09:21.626
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.
We're gonna take care of you.

09:21.793 --> 09:24.128
- Where's my dad?
- Another doctor's helping him.

09:24.294 --> 09:27.132
Okay, I'm gonna take this off.
I need you to be really still.

09:27.298 --> 09:28.634
- Okay.
- Like a statue.

09:28.799 --> 09:30.552
- Yes.
- Okay, here we go.

09:30.801 --> 09:33.805
Oh, good girl.
Lateral C-spine, chest and pelvis.

09:33.972 --> 09:35.474
Pressure's 100/70.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.602
- Is the fiberoptic in here?
- Back counter.

09:37.768 --> 09:39.728
- What's his pressure?
- Ninety-five.

09:39.896 --> 09:41.522
- Dad!
- Head still.

09:41.689 --> 09:43.733
- Is that my dad?
- Tender at the left axilla.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.611
- Might be a rib fracture.
- HemoCue times three and a Foley.

09:46.778 --> 09:48.822
- Pupils five millimeters and reactive.
- Abby.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.492
- Sorry.
- Hang two units O-neg. I need a crit.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.535
- Sats are falling, 92.
- Got the scope.

09:53.702 --> 09:55.537
Okay, we gotta crike him.

09:55.662 --> 09:59.167
Get me some cervical traction
and oral airway.

09:59.334 --> 10:01.837
- Sinus tach on the monitor. No ectopy.
- Oh, God.

10:02.003 --> 10:05.006
- What?
- Large hematoma in front of the trachea.

10:05.174 --> 10:08.052
- You got to be kidding me.
- Can you cut through that?

10:08.510 --> 10:11.681
No. I won't be able to see
anything through all that blood.

10:11.889 --> 10:13.933
Pulse ox is not corresponding.

10:14.100 --> 10:17.354
- I can't feel the landmarks.
- We need an airway.

10:18.355 --> 10:20.691
- Damn it.
- What do you want to do?

10:23.569 --> 10:25.196
Give me the scope.

10:25.362 --> 10:27.698
- First HemoCue, 13.4.
- What are we talking about?

10:27.865 --> 10:29.700
- Give me some cricoid pressure.
- On what?

10:29.867 --> 10:31.995
- Dial up the source all the way.
- Anybody home?

10:32.244 --> 10:35.081
Swollen airway. Expanding hematoma
blocking trach access.

10:35.332 --> 10:37.043
- How long's he been down?
- Two minutes.

10:37.250 --> 10:38.752
- Crike him.
- Too many vessels.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.547
-11 blade now.
- No. Just wait, I can't see as it is.

10:41.714 --> 10:43.548
- Trousseau dilater.
- Pulse ox, 84.

10:43.716 --> 10:45.885
- Bradying down.
- Wait, I'm almost underneath it.

10:46.052 --> 10:48.722
- Cutting.
- No, wait. Wait! I said, wait.

10:48.889 --> 10:51.683
His heart rate's 60.
Most chief residents know he'll arrest.

10:51.892 --> 10:53.977
We don't have an airway.
So mg of atropine.

10:54.144 --> 10:55.813
- Dropping to 50.
- Trauma shears.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.065
What are you doing?

10:59.900 --> 11:02.570
- Just clamp.
- BP's 80 systolic.

11:02.779 --> 11:05.240
No. You're gonna hit the internal carotid.

11:06.325 --> 11:08.035
Tracheostomy.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.121
- Field airway.
- Sats are climbing.

11:11.288 --> 11:12.581
- Dr. Lewis?
- Next door.

11:12.749 --> 11:15.995
Call RT for a vent. AC 12,
750 cc tidal on a 100%.

11:16.030 --> 11:18.841
Less whining, more action
next time, Dr. Carter.

11:18.876 --> 11:19.881
No deformity. No step-off.

11:20.131 --> 11:23.010
- Dr. Lewis?
- How about here?

11:23.176 --> 11:26.388
- A little.
- Five-by-seven mass over the scapula.

11:26.555 --> 11:29.601
- Let's have Surgery take a look at this.
- Susan, it's your sister.

11:29.767 --> 11:31.810
- What?
- She's on the phone.

11:31.978 --> 11:35.105
No. Chloe, you disappear
with Suzy after almost killing yourself.

11:35.315 --> 11:39.360
You don't call for three weeks.
Yeah, well, I hope so.

11:39.862 --> 11:42.113
Are you in an outpatient program?

11:42.281 --> 11:44.116
Where's Suzy gonna stay?

11:44.283 --> 11:46.285
He took you back?

11:46.494 --> 11:48.413
Oh, damn it.

11:49.205 --> 11:51.124
No. No, not you, Chloe.

11:51.291 --> 11:55.045
You know what? Fine. Fine, fine, fine.
Just give me the number, okay?

11:55.212 --> 11:57.298
Yeah, Chloe, listen.

11:57.505 --> 11:59.592
Yeah, I have to go.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.886
Chloe, I have to go.

12:02.053 --> 12:04.639
Yes, I love you too.

12:08.935 --> 12:11.730
CT's ready.
Urine is dip negative for blood.

12:11.897 --> 12:15.151
Forget the Foley. Page Pedes, Oncology.

12:15.358 --> 12:17.319
Calcified mass in the lung field.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.281
She has cancer?

12:21.282 --> 12:22.366
Keep your ankle cocked.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.994
You promised not to use the knife.

12:24.202 --> 12:28.165
- A.J. called in sick. I tried to be careful.
- Don't touch it.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.834
- That was too long.
- It's fine.

12:31.002 --> 12:34.504
- It's too long. It will itch.
- Okay, I'm done.

12:35.924 --> 12:38.301
- Who's picking you up?
- I took the train.

12:38.551 --> 12:41.805
- I'll get you a cab voucher. Keep it dry.
- Plastic bag like before.

12:41.971 --> 12:43.849
Come back in 10 days.

12:44.515 --> 12:49.521
I did this last time. I saw on TV, those
cutters where you put...

12:49.731 --> 12:53.859
...the bun in a covered white thing
and press down on the handle...

12:54.027 --> 12:57.530
...and it slices without using the knife.

12:57.698 --> 13:00.366
I asked Lance to get one of those.

13:00.701 --> 13:06.081
But he said those guys are crooks
and it would break right away.

13:07.374 --> 13:09.293
- What are you doing?
- This one's too long.

13:09.461 --> 13:11.755
Stop it. Stop it. George.

13:11.922 --> 13:14.758
I told you not to touch it.
Damn it, George.

13:14.925 --> 13:16.843
- I'm sorry.
- I don't care if you're sorry.

13:17.011 --> 13:20.556
I don't care if you're stupid.
If you don't listen, it'll never heal.

13:20.723 --> 13:22.725
Kerry, I'll do it.

13:22.892 --> 13:24.143
You should go home.

13:24.643 --> 13:27.531
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, George. I'm sorry.

13:44.540 --> 13:47.126
- Casper's Foley bag is full.
- I know.

13:47.835 --> 13:49.337
I don't know why I bought hoops.

13:50.338 --> 13:51.923
- They were cute.
- Yeah.

13:52.089 --> 13:54.092
The 3-year-old in 4 thought so too.

13:57.887 --> 14:00.806
Did you think
it was gonna happen so soon?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.936
He stopped treatment.

14:04.352 --> 14:08.899
Yeah, I know. But still, I mean,
he was just here working.

14:09.106 --> 14:12.526
I keep expecting to see him walk
around a corner or something.

14:12.736 --> 14:14.445
He was 38 years old.

14:14.612 --> 14:17.240
Too soon by any calculation.

14:18.116 --> 14:19.785
Yeah.

14:20.910 --> 14:22.829
Hey, when are you off?

14:22.996 --> 14:26.625
Now. Just don't feel like going home.

14:26.792 --> 14:29.252
What do you say we go out
and get plastered?

14:30.045 --> 14:33.298
- I'd say that's an appropriate response.
- Susan, I have to go.

14:33.507 --> 14:35.675
Bohan is an IUP,
12 weeks and spotting.

14:35.884 --> 14:37.344
Ultrasound's otherwise negative.

14:37.552 --> 14:39.512
Okay. Carter's on
for another couple hours.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.182
I'm waiting on a parent
to transfer a girl to Oncology.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.975
Okay.

14:44.934 --> 14:46.686
I'm sorry about Mark.

14:48.522 --> 14:50.483
Yeah.

14:51.816 --> 14:53.486
Hey, Kerry.

14:53.777 --> 14:57.030
Hey, Kerry, we're going out for drinks.
You want to come?

14:57.197 --> 15:00.658
- Thanks. I'd like to, but I can't.
- Yeah, sure you can.

15:00.868 --> 15:03.329
- The Lava Lounge on Damen.
- I have other plans.

15:03.495 --> 15:05.873
- But thanks anyway.
- Okay.

15:06.123 --> 15:07.957
- Good night.
- Bye.

15:09.335 --> 15:12.254
- The Lava Lounge?
- Yeah, you kind of have to see it.

15:12.420 --> 15:14.298
Dr. Romano needs you.

15:14.465 --> 15:16.341
Tell him I'm icing my ear.

15:16.508 --> 15:18.844
He's putting a chest tube
in your patient.

15:19.011 --> 15:20.554
- What?
- He came down for a consult.

15:20.721 --> 15:22.014
I canceled that consult.

15:22.181 --> 15:24.684
28 French on a vascular clamp.
Hang in there, Melissa.

15:24.850 --> 15:27.019
- What are you doing?
- Where's her CT?

15:27.187 --> 15:28.646
- Oncology has it.
- Oncology?

15:28.812 --> 15:31.066
Incidental finding.
Likely Rhabdomyosarcoma.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.026
- Did she have a hemopneumo?
- No.

15:33.358 --> 15:35.487
- She does now.
- What is it?

15:35.652 --> 15:38.280
We're gonna put a tube
in your chest to help you breathe.

15:38.448 --> 15:41.200
I'm in. Thoraseal.
Probably outgrew its blood supply...

15:41.367 --> 15:44.578
...bled into her chest cavity. Come on.
My dog fetches faster.

15:44.787 --> 15:47.207
- Is my mom here yet?
- Yeah, she's on her way.

15:47.373 --> 15:50.125
Call the O.R. Tell them we
have a red blanket. Get consent.

15:50.293 --> 15:52.879
Her father's in the SICU.
You criked him, remember?

15:53.045 --> 15:55.256
- Melissa, you need an operation.
- What?

15:55.423 --> 15:56.799
We're gonna take care of you.

15:57.008 --> 15:59.926
200 cc's already. Second signature.
Let's go.

16:00.094 --> 16:01.638
Don't worry.

16:07.143 --> 16:11.022
- We'll blow it off, go some other night.
- No. You changed your shift.

16:11.273 --> 16:14.400
Kerry, the guy died.
You should be with your staff tonight.

16:14.567 --> 16:17.945
- They were being polite.
- They're your friends.

16:18.113 --> 16:20.781
They're people I work with.

16:21.407 --> 16:25.537
One of our guys goes down, the company
gets together and we get drunk.

16:25.662 --> 16:28.540
It's more for the unit
than the guy who's gone.

16:28.706 --> 16:31.001
I'm not a firefighter.

16:31.208 --> 16:34.838
Basically the same job, isn't it?
You put out fires.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.096
Mark and I always butted heads.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.974
I was always trying to maneuver him...

16:46.308 --> 16:50.020
...gain some kind of edge
like it had to be a competition.

16:50.187 --> 16:53.357
He just wanted to do his job well
and go home.

16:57.110 --> 17:01.240
I've known this was coming for a while,
and I never imagined...

17:01.406 --> 17:03.159
...that I would feel like this.

17:05.827 --> 17:07.329
You've lost a friend.

17:10.332 --> 17:12.460
I think I have.

17:12.834 --> 17:16.455
All I got out of him was, they put him on
dialysis for three days once...

17:16.491 --> 17:17.798
He hated it.

17:17.964 --> 17:19.884
Then he passed out.

17:22.887 --> 17:25.723
- As in vagalled?
- As in old.

17:26.223 --> 17:28.976
- Find his old chart?
- Still pulling it. I need a forklift.

17:29.143 --> 17:31.812
His temp's down, but he's altered.
He called me "son" once.

17:31.979 --> 17:34.148
Glucose is over 400.
You owe me 20 bucks.

17:34.315 --> 17:37.610
Started that insulin drip.
And he could be uremic.

17:37.818 --> 17:39.111
You know, your basic "MMP. "

17:39.987 --> 17:42.698
- MMP?
- Multiple medical problems.

17:42.990 --> 17:44.284
You just make this stuff up?

17:44.450 --> 17:46.952
What? Multiple medical problems?
M- M-P, MMP.

17:47.162 --> 17:49.664
All right, start with a urogram
and do a repeat Chem-20.

17:49.748 --> 17:50.956
I did it twice already.

17:51.082 --> 17:52.751
Just CT his belly and his pelvis...

17:52.958 --> 17:55.670
- ... and call Nephrology.
- They won't take him. He's septic.

17:55.836 --> 17:58.881
Well, then we'll dialyze down here
until we can admit to the unit.

17:59.090 --> 18:01.885
Or we could turf him to Medicine
and let them figure it out.

18:02.052 --> 18:03.761
Right now he belongs to us.

18:03.928 --> 18:07.682
I'm gonna write this down now. Sure
you're not gonna change your mind again?

18:07.849 --> 18:09.976
- Pratt, your letter.
- Where was it?

18:10.143 --> 18:12.187
Filed N for "ne'er-do-well. "

18:12.395 --> 18:15.023
- What's your first choice?
- I ain't saying.

18:15.315 --> 18:17.483
See you at the Lava Lounge, Dr. Carter?

18:17.609 --> 18:20.653
- What?
- Couple people going out for drinks.

18:20.820 --> 18:22.822
- Don't feel like doing much else.
- Who?

18:22.990 --> 18:26.326
Dr. Kovac, Dr. Lewis, Abby, Haleh.

18:27.828 --> 18:30.663
Maybe. I don't know.
I got some dictations I need to finish.

18:30.831 --> 18:32.374
Okay. If you change your mind...

18:32.540 --> 18:34.125
Good night.

18:34.752 --> 18:36.502
Bad news?

18:37.545 --> 18:39.922
- Yeah, you could say that.
- Second choice?

18:40.090 --> 18:41.717
Last choice.

18:41.924 --> 18:45.012
Someone's got to get their last choice.
Where is it?

18:45.137 --> 18:46.722
Here.

18:47.723 --> 18:49.141
Good for us.

18:49.307 --> 18:51.935
You know, I had better be getting
my damn locker.

18:59.652 --> 19:01.403
Well, that was fast.

19:01.570 --> 19:03.573
- What?
- You haven't even had a drink yet...

19:03.739 --> 19:06.950
- ... you already got somebody's number?
- Oh, my God. What is that?

19:07.118 --> 19:10.079
- Two Sacrificial Virgins.
- How much alcohol is in there?

19:10.370 --> 19:13.623
Enough to make you forget
you're being thrown into a volcano.

19:13.790 --> 19:15.125
I get it.

19:15.292 --> 19:16.752
- I think.
- Do you need some help?

19:16.919 --> 19:18.921
Yeah. Can I start a tab?

19:19.087 --> 19:20.339
Sure, Susan.

19:21.382 --> 19:23.342
Oh, my God. Those are our drinks?

19:23.508 --> 19:26.553
- Too tacky?
- No, not for this place.

19:26.762 --> 19:28.890
- I'm just bummed I forgot my grass skirt.
- Yeah.

19:29.056 --> 19:31.142
I was gonna wear my coconut bra,
but it itches.

19:31.309 --> 19:34.478
- How did you know about this place?
- Mark had a birthday here once.

19:34.645 --> 19:36.063
It seemed appropriate.

19:36.230 --> 19:37.481
- Thanks.
- Haleh.

19:37.648 --> 19:38.941
Martini.

19:39.108 --> 19:42.279
- Coke.
- Yeah. How did they find all this stuff?

19:42.445 --> 19:45.489
It's kind of creepy. I keep expecting
Vincent Price to show up.

19:48.367 --> 19:51.163
So should we toast or something?

19:51.621 --> 19:53.456
Good idea.

19:55.332 --> 19:57.085
Me?

19:57.461 --> 19:58.669
You knew him the longest.

19:59.463 --> 20:02.214
I'm not very good under pressure.
Someone else go first.

20:08.972 --> 20:11.349
What the hell, I'll drink to that.

20:18.315 --> 20:20.191
Looks like we're going public.

20:21.860 --> 20:23.737
Hey, Kerry.

20:25.364 --> 20:26.740
Hey.

20:27.157 --> 20:32.078
Well-encapsulated discreet mass.
No extension to the visceral pleura.

20:32.246 --> 20:33.913
Pickups.

20:34.372 --> 20:35.874
Did you talk to Dr. Corday?

20:35.957 --> 20:38.001
Yeah, Shirley, I'm at the top of her list.

20:38.169 --> 20:40.336
Right after the funeral home.

20:41.337 --> 20:43.048
What?

20:43.256 --> 20:46.301
Penetrated the rib cage.
We are gonna be here all night.

20:46.468 --> 20:48.512
At least you caught it.

20:54.059 --> 20:57.563
Amazing how the human body...

20:57.813 --> 20:59.898
...can turn on itself.

21:01.150 --> 21:03.819
The very process we need to grow
in the womb to...

21:03.902 --> 21:07.949
...regenerate ourselves
systematically eating us alive.

21:08.115 --> 21:09.616
And no one's sacred.

21:09.742 --> 21:13.371
Little girls. Fathers with little girls.

21:15.497 --> 21:19.126
Cancer. Brain cancer, liver cancer,
breast cancer.

21:19.294 --> 21:23.881
It's the same traitor,
the same merciless...

21:24.257 --> 21:27.635
...unrelenting predator.

21:27.843 --> 21:29.721
Like time itself.

21:31.931 --> 21:34.600
- I hope you're not driving.
- No.

21:34.766 --> 21:36.561
You're not on call, are you?

21:36.727 --> 21:39.647
What are you,
some sort of Nazi bartender?

21:39.814 --> 21:42.525
I prefer to think of myself
as magnanimous.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.569
- Hey.
- Hey, Carter.

21:44.736 --> 21:47.822
- We thought you were gonna blow us off.
- Did you pick this place?

21:48.281 --> 21:50.825
- She's outside.
- Who?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.043
John Carter makes an appearance.

22:01.210 --> 22:04.088
Abigail Lockhart sits alone.

22:05.757 --> 22:09.468
- It's a nice jacket. Is it new?
- What, do you have ESP?

22:10.094 --> 22:12.139
No, your car's right there.

22:13.431 --> 22:16.392
I saw you circle the building twice.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.811
Thanks for yelling out directions.

22:19.311 --> 22:23.692
Didn't wanna encourage you. I don't think
you should be hanging around in bars.

22:23.900 --> 22:25.610
You got me there.

22:29.030 --> 22:31.074
Great letter, though.

22:33.785 --> 22:36.705
I especially enjoyed the surprise ending.

22:40.417 --> 22:41.961
I didn't write it.

22:42.168 --> 22:46.340
Well, that's the last time
we let you read out loud then.

22:47.632 --> 22:50.010
Suddenly antisocial?

22:50.428 --> 22:52.930
No, you just missed my table dance.

22:53.096 --> 22:54.973
- Hula?
- Oh, yeah.

22:55.140 --> 22:58.227
Well, I'll have to stick around
for the second show.

23:04.733 --> 23:07.069
How many lives do you think?

23:08.112 --> 23:09.697
What?

23:09.864 --> 23:12.241
How many lives do you think he saved?

23:15.160 --> 23:16.996
It's hard to say.

23:18.497 --> 23:23.670
One a shift on average, I guess.
Five shifts a week for 10 years.

23:24.295 --> 23:27.214
- Two or three thousand people.
- Damn.

23:29.717 --> 23:32.971
Forget Superman, I'll take Mark Greene.

23:34.138 --> 23:37.934
Well, if I knew you felt that way, I would
have shaved my head a long time ago.

23:53.658 --> 23:55.410
Are you okay?

24:11.384 --> 24:12.719
Come on.

24:12.927 --> 24:15.221
- Come on what?
- Let's get out of here.

24:15.430 --> 24:19.518
- And ditch our friends?
- I think that they'll get over it.

24:19.935 --> 24:21.686
Okay.

24:23.271 --> 24:26.775
- You know, I have a tiki mask in there.
- I'll buy you another one.

24:27.359 --> 24:28.777
Where are we going?

24:28.944 --> 24:31.112
I know a place on Franklin.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.072
- The titty bar?
- No.

24:33.282 --> 24:34.741
Well...

24:34.908 --> 24:36.785
- Oh, the tattoo parlor.
- No.

24:36.952 --> 24:39.162
No. Where are we going?

24:39.455 --> 24:41.164
Bill's place.

24:41.873 --> 24:43.250
No.

24:43.458 --> 24:45.585
- No, thank you.
- Come on. There's a meeting at 1.

24:45.752 --> 24:48.105
- Great. Go. I'll catch up.
- When's the last time you went?

24:48.172 --> 24:49.881
- What do you think?
- What's it gonna hurt?

24:50.048 --> 24:52.926
- It'll kill my buzz for starters.
- Come on, one step at a time.

24:53.093 --> 24:56.471
I sponsored you. Remember? Save the
dogma. Besides, you screwed it up.

24:56.681 --> 24:59.684
- I'm screwing it up?
- Yes. Would you say that I'm drunk?

24:59.850 --> 25:02.103
- Yeah.
- You can't go to meetings drunk.

25:02.269 --> 25:04.729
- They'll overlook it.
- And the program is voluntary.

25:04.896 --> 25:07.816
- Then get in the car voluntarily.
- Come on, out of my way.

25:07.984 --> 25:10.193
You are going,
even if I have to carry you.

25:10.361 --> 25:12.780
- Thanks for caring, but not tonight.
- Yeah, tonight.

25:12.989 --> 25:15.032
- No. Slow down, tough guy.
- Get in the car.

25:15.199 --> 25:16.492
- No.
- Get in the car.

25:16.659 --> 25:18.327
- No, no.
- Hey.

25:18.494 --> 25:20.913
- Hey, no. John! Stop.
- You're going.

25:21.122 --> 25:24.501
Stop it. Help! Help!

25:25.459 --> 25:28.212
- Son of a bitch! You bit me?
- You dropped me.

25:28.379 --> 25:30.924
- I can't believe you bit me.
- I told you to put me down.

25:31.090 --> 25:32.843
- I think that might be bleeding.
- Good.

25:33.008 --> 25:35.428
- Everything okay out here?
- Yeah.

25:42.727 --> 25:45.146
I'm sorry. I just-
I can't...

25:46.314 --> 25:49.441
I can't go to a meeting tonight.
I won't do it.

25:50.818 --> 25:52.696
Let's go get something to eat.

25:53.278 --> 25:54.698
Come on. A cup of coffee.

26:00.161 --> 26:01.871
Thank you.

26:09.295 --> 26:13.034
We gotta stop at a pharmacy.
I'll get some gauze and bandage that.

26:18.771 --> 26:20.189
A crate?

26:20.357 --> 26:21.650
Four feet by two feet.

26:21.775 --> 26:24.194
Greene gets a crate of live lobsters...

26:24.362 --> 26:27.908
- ... for a pericardiocentesis?
- Every Memorial Day.

26:28.074 --> 26:31.371
I gave a Heimlich to a kid at the zoo once,
didn't even get a thank-you.

26:31.537 --> 26:33.581
I've been working up to a fruit basket.

26:33.748 --> 26:36.585
Wait. Is this the surf and turf
we had on the roof?

26:36.752 --> 26:38.380
Yeah.

26:39.339 --> 26:41.676
That was good.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.637
- We can't tell him.
- Tell him what?

26:44.805 --> 26:46.598
That he's dead.

26:47.224 --> 26:49.435
We have to keep it coming.

26:49.602 --> 26:51.312
That's a survivor talking.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.440
We're starting breakfast.
You want anything?

26:53.649 --> 26:56.111
- Yeah. Two mimosas, please.
- Excuse me?

26:56.277 --> 26:58.280
No, we're fine.

27:04.997 --> 27:07.291
It started on my birthday.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.252
What?

27:10.504 --> 27:15.343
I didn't start drinking when Brian hit me.
I started drinking before that.

27:16.344 --> 27:20.808
And I probably wouldn't have been stupid
enough to open the door if I hadn't been.

27:21.810 --> 27:23.812
Self-pity excuse.

27:24.020 --> 27:25.648
Well, it's one of my better ones.

27:27.316 --> 27:29.026
What time is it?

27:29.319 --> 27:34.993
Oh, God. It's almost 6:00.
Oh, my God. I have to work tonight.

27:35.369 --> 27:37.831
- You sober?
- Unfortunately.

27:38.707 --> 27:42.961
Good. Then I have got just enough time
to drop you off at a meeting.

27:43.129 --> 27:45.506
No. I have to go to bed.

27:45.923 --> 27:48.844
- Let's go.
- Nope.

27:49.344 --> 27:51.848
But if you quit bugging me,
I promise I'll go later.

27:52.015 --> 27:53.474
When?

27:53.642 --> 27:54.977
Before my shift.

27:55.144 --> 27:59.107
Good, you're here. I was gonna page you,
but Jerry said you were on at 7.

27:59.858 --> 28:02.319
- You're on at 7?
- Yeah. I've done it before.

28:02.486 --> 28:04.238
- What is it?
- It's your homeless guy.

28:04.406 --> 28:07.284
- Six-beat run of ectopy.
- How long has that been going on?

28:07.451 --> 28:09.537
Almost an hour. I needed to start lido...

28:09.745 --> 28:13.125
...but I couldn't get a directive
in his chart, and he won't tell me.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.585
She don't listen.

28:14.793 --> 28:17.714
70 milligrams IV load
and then start a drip at two per minute.

28:17.923 --> 28:20.049
- Wait. So he's full code?
- There he goes again.

28:20.217 --> 28:22.887
I don't know. He was Greene's
private patient or something.

28:23.095 --> 28:25.891
- Yeah, we lost his pressure.
- Mr. Ervin?

28:26.099 --> 28:27.977
- No pulse.
- Okay, starting CPR.

28:28.185 --> 28:29.895
- You sure?
- No.

28:30.105 --> 28:33.192
- Slow PEA.
- Mg of epi. Prep an amp of atropine.

28:33.358 --> 28:35.862
Well, guess that clears it up.
Intubation tray.

28:36.028 --> 28:39.116
I'll do it. 7.5 ET and a 3 Mac blade.

28:39.324 --> 28:43.121
- V-fib.
- Okay, charge paddles to 200.

28:43.538 --> 28:45.583
No pressure, no pulse.

28:46.710 --> 28:48.962
And clear.

28:50.213 --> 28:51.715
All right, charge again to 300.

28:52.008 --> 28:53.635
Back to sinus.

28:53.801 --> 28:55.261
I've got a pulse.

28:55.429 --> 28:59.599
Tough old bird.
Okay, 20 of etomidate, eight of Pav.

28:59.851 --> 29:02.813
Wait, wait, wait.
Carter, I think he's trying to talk.

29:03.188 --> 29:05.525
Dr. Greene.

29:05.859 --> 29:08.111
- No.
- What?

29:08.278 --> 29:10.530
No tubes.

29:10.698 --> 29:12.575
No shocks.

29:12.868 --> 29:14.786
What did he say?

29:15.830 --> 29:17.790
He said no more.

29:35.812 --> 29:38.525
- Thanks for destroying my night.
- Did you get it?

29:38.692 --> 29:41.903
She bled like stink. Control was nearly
impossible around the rib cage.

29:42.071 --> 29:44.323
I was inside and outside
the chest simultaneously.

29:44.532 --> 29:47.160
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

29:47.327 --> 29:50.331
Resected fully. Margins are clear.

29:50.540 --> 29:52.709
- How's Daddy?
- Breathing over the vent.

29:52.877 --> 29:55.713
Reflexes fully intact.
Should be extubated by this afternoon.

29:55.880 --> 29:59.010
It was lucky they got plowed
by that cement truck.

29:59.593 --> 30:02.847
These suckers rate 50% mortality
once they break out.

30:04.140 --> 30:07.019
I'll tell Mom. You should get some sleep.
You look like crap.

30:07.185 --> 30:09.689
Dr. Romano, are you sure you got it?

30:10.064 --> 30:11.941
I got it.

30:17.073 --> 30:20.328
The only thing he's been consistent
about is not wanting any treatment.

30:20.453 --> 30:22.371
If he discussed this with Dr. Greene,

30:22.497 --> 30:24.208
then there should be a note in the charts.

30:24.374 --> 30:27.254
Well, maybe Dr. Greene
expected to be here.

30:27.420 --> 30:29.506
Fine. He's your patient.

30:29.965 --> 30:32.009
I have no idea what you're saying.
I'm sorry.

30:32.177 --> 30:34.429
- Should someone save him?
- No.

30:35.556 --> 30:37.141
I don't understand.

30:39.895 --> 30:42.397
- What's the problem, Pratt?
- I don't speak Portuguese.

30:42.607 --> 30:44.400
- That's Italian.
- That either.

30:46.694 --> 30:49.156
Grandma was babysitting,
and he woke up with this rash.

30:49.323 --> 30:53.077
She can't tell me if he's got any allergies,
and I can't find the parents.

30:53.286 --> 30:54.620
Strawberry.

30:54.830 --> 30:57.583
- What?
- Strawberry. Jelly, jam, maybe cereal.

30:57.792 --> 31:00.587
Probably eating it
before he went to sleep.

31:01.422 --> 31:03.966
Hey, you know anybody
at Northwestern?

31:04.133 --> 31:06.386
- Yeah, I know a few.
- Could you do me a favor?

31:06.553 --> 31:09.140
Tell them they made a mistake,
that they should take me.

31:09.307 --> 31:12.059
- No. I'd have to believe that.
- Come on, you know I'm good.

31:12.227 --> 31:14.897
- Too good to be wasted at County?
- I didn't say that.

31:15.105 --> 31:17.859
Look, we're an under-serviced community,
and we need doctors.

31:18.026 --> 31:19.987
For better or for worse, we drew you.

31:20.195 --> 31:22.323
Blood sugar over 400. Good pick-up.

31:22.489 --> 31:23.782
Yeah, thanks.

31:29.958 --> 31:34.088
I shouldn't have sat down.
If I don't sit down, I won't cry.

31:35.256 --> 31:38.719
- Well, you have to sit down eventually.
- Yeah.

31:38.886 --> 31:43.266
Can't I just pretend he moved to the
South Pacific and lived happily ever after?

31:43.934 --> 31:45.936
In a way, he did.

31:48.063 --> 31:50.484
A girl and her father...

31:50.902 --> 31:54.823
...are hit by a cement truck
on the way to ballet class.

31:55.197 --> 31:59.162
A malignant tumor invades her chest,
and we find it by happenstance.

32:00.622 --> 32:03.500
She'll walk out of here in a week
with not a care in the world.

32:05.044 --> 32:08.715
Mark walked the halls of a hospital every
day and didn't know about his tumor...

32:08.882 --> 32:11.218
...till he presented with symptoms.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.390
Well, we save who we can, right?

32:17.392 --> 32:19.312
It has to make more sense than that.

32:21.857 --> 32:24.402
You're looking for a reason?

32:27.031 --> 32:28.532
I miss him already.

32:31.119 --> 32:33.705
- Me too.
- I went away for five years.

32:33.913 --> 32:37.044
I thought of him on occasion.

32:37.418 --> 32:39.379
Talked to him sporadically.

32:42.215 --> 32:45.888
But I miss him.
I thought he'd always, always be here.

32:49.225 --> 32:51.311
Well, it's good to miss him.

32:52.354 --> 32:54.106
It's missing him that keeps him here.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.694
Yeah.

33:03.367 --> 33:05.328
You should write for Hallmark.

33:05.495 --> 33:07.414
I have hidden talents.

33:08.082 --> 33:11.086
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. It's okay.

33:11.294 --> 33:13.005
I have to get back to work.

33:13.172 --> 33:16.301
I have a pilonidal cyst
in 5 waiting to be lanced.

33:16.468 --> 33:18.803
Give it to Pratt.
He needs the humility.

33:18.971 --> 33:21.058
That will be cathartic.

33:29.943 --> 33:31.778
- Where did you get that?
- What?

33:31.988 --> 33:35.325
- Combination.
- Personnel.

33:35.492 --> 33:37.244
Pratt matched at County.

33:38.037 --> 33:39.331
Yes, I know.

33:39.497 --> 33:40.832
He keeps bitching about it.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.878
He needs a locker.

33:44.044 --> 33:46.213
Thought I'd spare Elizabeth the chore.

33:48.383 --> 33:50.762
Heard you had some trouble
with Romano yesterday.

33:52.055 --> 33:53.724
He was right.

33:54.183 --> 33:55.559
I took too long making a decision.

33:55.642 --> 33:57.936
You don't have that luxury anymore.

33:58.146 --> 33:59.439
I never really thought I did.

34:04.028 --> 34:05.780
Mark's gone.

34:05.947 --> 34:08.909
That means you've been here
longer than any other doctor.

34:09.076 --> 34:12.664
People will look to you
to step in and fill the void.

34:15.375 --> 34:16.835
Big void.

34:17.003 --> 34:18.338
Yes, it is.

34:26.806 --> 34:29.268
I can't do this. Will you do this?

34:31.355 --> 34:33.018
Thank you.

35:51.495 --> 35:54.832
Shotgun to the face.
This is gonna be fun, huh?

35:55.123 --> 35:57.376
Cheaper than plastic surgery.

35:58.751 --> 36:00.545
How's the bite?

36:00.879 --> 36:03.047
I'm not howling at the moon.

36:03.965 --> 36:05.967
There is no moon.

36:06.926 --> 36:09.386
- How did it go?
- What?

36:10.638 --> 36:12.348
The meeting.

36:12.974 --> 36:14.809
It was boring.

36:15.101 --> 36:16.811
You went?

36:17.145 --> 36:19.855
Yeah. I just said it was boring, didn't I?

36:21.481 --> 36:23.817
Sorry, they didn't give me a card.

36:26.778 --> 36:30.907
You went for you or because you
promised me you would?

36:33.119 --> 36:35.578
Is this guy gonna look like hamburger?

36:36.329 --> 36:39.499
More like ground chuck.

36:45.255 --> 36:47.215
I went for you.

36:54.138 --> 36:56.473
- You're gonna need some more people.
- Why?

36:57.975 --> 36:59.476
Come on, hard restraints!

36:59.601 --> 37:00.727
- No IV?
-20 of morphine...

37:00.812 --> 37:01.979
...before he pulled out.

37:02.187 --> 37:05.649
- Sir, we need you to hold still.
- Come on, Gallant, keep him on the table.

37:05.816 --> 37:09.360
-100 of fent, two of Ativan.
- Page Surgery, Plastics, Head and Neck.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.780
- Could be PCP.
- Or the gunshot wound.

37:11.947 --> 37:14.449
Sir, we're gonna help you.
But you gotta hold still...

37:14.616 --> 37:18.411
- ... while we get the morphine into you.
- Okay, pressure 100/80.

37:18.620 --> 37:20.830
- Pulse, 150.
- Get access. We need to sedate him.

37:20.955 --> 37:23.166
- Get a 7.5 ET tube.
- You won't be able to use it.

37:23.332 --> 37:26.545
- Break open lap pads and a crike tray.
- Gallant, hold down his arm.

37:26.752 --> 37:28.671
- Seven sterile...
- Gallant.

37:28.838 --> 37:32.133
- ... and an 11 blade. Drape his neck.
- All right, fent's in.

37:32.299 --> 37:34.176
Get some O-2 in him. 100% by mask.

37:34.260 --> 37:35.469
I'm pushing meds.

37:35.594 --> 37:37.847
- Gallant. Gallant.
- Okay, okay, okay.

37:38.013 --> 37:39.348
He's settling down. Betadine.

37:39.515 --> 37:42.309
-20 of etomidate.
- Wait, are we tubing him or criking him?

37:42.476 --> 37:44.644
- Criking. Look at his face.
- Just taking a peek.

37:44.812 --> 37:48.523
- All right, bradying down.
- Yeah, he aspirated too much blood.

37:48.690 --> 37:51.235
- Open the crash cart.
- Gallant, unroof his jaw...

37:51.402 --> 37:54.153
...and hold it out of the way.
I need to see the epiglottis.

37:54.321 --> 37:57.949
- Mg of atropine.
- Susan, hook your finger under his tongue.

37:59.367 --> 38:01.577
- I can't do it.
- Don't move. Abduct the mandible.

38:01.702 --> 38:03.204
- I need to sit down.
- Don't move.

38:03.413 --> 38:05.957
- V-tach.
- All right, I'm in. Let go, Gallant.

38:06.124 --> 38:07.833
- Charge is 200.
- Hyperventilating.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.627
- Sats are 90.
- Clear.

38:09.793 --> 38:11.671
- Sinus rhythm.
- Okay, full trauma panel.

38:11.837 --> 38:15.633
C- spine, chest and pelvis. Gallant,
why don't you go get yourself some air?

38:15.799 --> 38:17.051
Want a facial CT?

38:17.552 --> 38:21.346
Yeah, good idea. Why don't we get a full
head series? Call RT. Let's get a vent.

38:21.805 --> 38:23.682
Give him four of Ativan, seven of Pav.

38:23.890 --> 38:25.934
Nice work, John.

38:52.167 --> 38:54.254
Bet that was a new one.

38:55.546 --> 38:57.756
Yeah. Yeah.

38:59.757 --> 39:01.593
Look, I'm sorry.

39:02.260 --> 39:04.596
I just thought
I was gonna be sick.

39:05.639 --> 39:08.058
It's better if you keep your head down.

39:10.644 --> 39:13.813
It'll be okay. It just caught me
by surprise, you know?

39:13.980 --> 39:15.941
Relax. Take a minute.

39:20.945 --> 39:23.614
You know, sometimes I don't think
I can do this.

39:30.454 --> 39:32.873
You know, there's two kinds of doctors.

39:35.334 --> 39:37.795
There's the kind that get rid
of their feelings...

39:38.002 --> 39:40.380
...and the kind that hold on to them.

39:43.967 --> 39:48.263
If you're gonna hold on to your feelings,
you're gonna get sick once in a while.

39:48.846 --> 39:50.640
It's part of it.

39:57.814 --> 39:59.899
You know, people come in here...

40:00.525 --> 40:02.192
...and they're sick...

40:02.902 --> 40:04.821
...and they're bleeding...

40:06.322 --> 40:08.198
...sometimes they're dying...

40:09.033 --> 40:10.868
...and they need our help.

40:13.037 --> 40:16.665
And helping them is more important
than how we feel.

40:30.303 --> 40:34.057
Hell, I've been doing this eight years.
I still get sick.

40:37.227 --> 40:39.019
Take another minute.

40:48.278 --> 40:51.615
- Did he go up?
- OMFS, ENT and Plastics all in.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.450
Both carotids and IJ's intact.

40:53.533 --> 40:55.577
He must have turned right
when the blast hit him.

40:55.744 --> 40:58.162
- Good.
- How's he doing?

40:58.330 --> 41:02.292
Oh, he'll be all right. How are you?

41:03.335 --> 41:04.920
Ask me tomorrow.

41:05.045 --> 41:07.213
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:24.938 --> 41:26.732
He might need some fluids soon.

41:26.940 --> 41:30.194
No. Morphine boluses of 10.

41:40.453 --> 41:42.623
I heard you were gone.

41:44.749 --> 41:46.167
No, I'm still here.

41:47.794 --> 41:49.712
Good.

41:51.547 --> 41:55.091
You know I don't like
nobody else helping me.

42:02.182 --> 42:03.935
I know.

42:05.227 --> 42:09.189
You've always treated me like a man.

42:12.442 --> 42:13.902
Just try and relax.

42:15.695 --> 42:17.697
What is that?

42:17.989 --> 42:21.743
That monitor's just a little sensitive,
that's all.

42:27.499 --> 42:29.501
I'm scared.

42:30.793 --> 42:32.794
There's no reason to be.

42:33.588 --> 42:35.173
Everything's okay.

42:42.054 --> 42:45.390
I could have been a better person.

42:49.478 --> 42:52.272
I could have done more.

42:56.025 --> 42:57.944
You did enough.

43:00.112 --> 43:02.198
Stay with me.

43:02.407 --> 43:04.492
It won't be much longer.

43:14.043 --> 43:15.252
I'll stay right here.

43:38.357 --> 43:40.526
- Let me see.
- I think I singed my eyebrow.

43:40.693 --> 43:44.280
I need to see. You thought it was a good
idea to put kerosene in your barbecue?

43:44.489 --> 43:47.032
- I thought it was lighter fluid.
- It doesn't look burnt.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.744
I'll check for corneal burns
with an ultraviolet light.

43:49.911 --> 43:51.871
I need everything documented.
Worker's comp.

43:52.037 --> 43:54.373
- You're a chef?
- It was my summer office party.

43:54.581 --> 43:57.376
Oh, I don't think that counts.

43:57.542 --> 43:59.127
Any word on the air conditioning?

43:59.253 --> 44:02.840
- Yeah. They think it'll be fixed by winter.
- I can't work like this.

44:03.006 --> 44:05.301
- You want a Big Stick?
- No.

44:05.467 --> 44:07.927
- Why did I buy these shoes?
- Because they were cute.

44:08.094 --> 44:09.679
- Some help here.
- Yeah, what is it?

44:09.888 --> 44:13.099
Car rammed into a picnic at Lincoln Park.
I got three rigs behind me.

44:13.265 --> 44:14.517
- John?
- Yeah, I got it.

44:14.684 --> 44:17.227
- Intubated, regular pulse, good sats.
- Get Neurosurgery.

44:17.395 --> 44:20.398
- Warn CT they'll get busy.
-12-year-old boy, dislocated shoulder...

44:20.565 --> 44:23.233
...multiple lacerations.
BP, 100/60. Pulse, 120.

44:23.400 --> 44:25.445
Hey, I'm Dr. Carter. What's your name?

44:25.652 --> 44:28.531
What's that?
Okay, we're gonna take care of you.

44:28.697 --> 44:30.653
Set me up...

44:41.006 --> 44:44.017
