(chuckles)

YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

PROBABLY WANTS KIDS.
YEAH.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.323

I'M NOT SURE

09:19.289 --> 09:22.262
YOUR BREASTS ARE FANTASTIC.
I WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.137
THE PATIENT.

09:27.137 --> 09:29.299
UM, HE, UH...

09:29.299 --> 09:31.301
HE'S GOT
POST-PNEUMONECTOMY SYNDROME,

09:31.301 --> 09:34.975
AND I WANTED TO USE THE IMPLANTS
TO STABILIZE HIS HEART.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.848
OF COURSE.
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

09:39.309 --> 09:42.613
UH, SO ASKING YOU OUT
TONIGHT...

09:42.613 --> 09:44.054
PROBABLY A BAD IDEA?

09:44.054 --> 09:46.316
(laughs) Y-YOU THINK?

09:55.165 --> 09:56.697
WHAT?

09:56.697 --> 09:59.800
MARK SLOAN JUST ASKED ME OUT.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.331
HUH.

10:01.331 --> 10:03.173
COOL.

10:03.173 --> 10:07.107
NO, NO, NOT "COOL."
MARK SLOAN.

RIGHT? COME ON. YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:15.015 --> 10:18.018
THIS MIGHT BE
THE BEST IDEA I'VE EVER HAD.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.189

10:21.321 --> 10:24.024
WILL YOU, UH, HAVE TO RESECT
A PART OF THE DIAPHRAGM?

10:24.024 --> 10:25.826
WELL, MOST LIKELY.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.999
OR I MIGHT LET YOU DO
THE RESECTION.

10:28.999 --> 10:30.260
REALLY?

10:30.260 --> 10:32.863
YEP, THAT OR KICK YOU OFF
THE CASE.

10:32.863 --> 10:36.837
DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH
YOU'VE LEAKED TO DR. HUNT.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.670
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
A LONG TIME, DR. YANG.

10:39.670 --> 10:41.872
YOU'RE WORKING
FOR THE OTHER SIDE.

10:41.872 --> 10:43.714
NOW...

10:43.714 --> 10:46.046
THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION...

10:46.046 --> 10:50.050
IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO REALIGN YOUR ALLEGIANCES.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.122
LIKE BE A DOUBLE AGENT?

10:52.122 --> 10:54.124
AND WE COULD KEEP LOOKING

10:54.124 --> 10:57.888
FOR MORE RESECTIONS
FOR YOU TO PERFORM.

10:57.888 --> 11:01.161
SO YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.863
TAKE YOUR TIME.

11:04.735 --> 11:07.768
IT'S A BIG TUMOR.

11:11.201 --> 11:13.904

11:13.904 --> 11:18.008

42 INTERN QUESTIONS AN HOUR.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.754

OH, SURE. (giggles)

I SMILE LIKE THIS FOR COFFEE.

11:37.067 --> 11:39.429
UH, HE'S MAKING ME DINNER.

11:39.429 --> 11:42.032
HE'S COOKING?

11:42.032 --> 11:44.935
WOW. YOU READY?

11:44.935 --> 11:47.978
WHAT, FOR FOOD?
YEAH, I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT.

11:47.978 --> 11:50.040
UH, NO, FOR SEX.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.142
WHAT? N--GROW UP.

11:52.142 --> 11:55.786
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.
HOW MANY DATES HAVE YOU HAD?
THIS'LL BE THREE.

11:55.786 --> 11:58.789
OH, YEAH. YEAH, THIRD DATE'S
THE SEX DATE.

11:58.789 --> 12:01.992
AND HE'S COOKING FOR YOU...
AT HIS HOME...

12:01.992 --> 12:04.154
WHERE HE KEEPS HIS BED.

12:04.154 --> 12:06.156
I BARELY KNOW THE MAN.

12:06.156 --> 12:09.159
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA KNOW HIM
A LOT BETTER TOMORROW.

12:09.159 --> 12:13.003
(laughs) THERE IS NOTHING MAGIC
ABOUT A THIRD DATE.

12:13.003 --> 12:15.305
IT IS POSSIBLE TO EAT
AND GO HOME

12:15.305 --> 12:18.038
AND NOT LOSE YOUR PANTS
IN THE PROCESS.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.739
OKAY.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.073
UH, BUT IF IT DOES GO THAT WAY,
AM I SUPPOSED TO SLEEP OVER?

12:23.073 --> 12:25.876
OH, NO. NO.
SEX ON THE COUCH.

12:25.876 --> 12:28.819
WALK OF SHAME TO THE CAR
UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS.

12:28.819 --> 12:30.350

12:30.350 --> 12:33.283
UNH-UNH. CASUAL, LIKE--LIKE YOU
DON'T EXPECT IT'S GONNA HAPPEN,

12:33.283 --> 12:36.526
BUT YOU'RE READY
FOR IT TO HAPPEN.
OH. HOW READY?

12:36.526 --> 12:41.361

THE SURGICAL FIELD...

12:41.361 --> 12:43.063

12:43.063 --> 12:45.435
(gasps) OH, TORRES.

12:45.435 --> 12:48.038
THERE IS A UKRAINIAN WOMAN

12:48.038 --> 12:51.902
WHO WORKS AT THE MANICURE PLACE
ACROSS THE STREET.

12:51.902 --> 12:53.343
SHE WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

12:53.343 --> 12:56.146

TO GIVE HIM THIS MUCH MEDICINE

13:06.216 --> 13:09.219

WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?
OKAY,
IT'S NOT GONNA HURT HIM.

13:09.219 --> 13:12.863
HE NEEDED A PAINKILLER, JIM.
I'M TELLING YOU, HE NEEDED IT.

13:12.863 --> 13:16.266

HONEY, I DON'T.

13:25.275 --> 13:28.278

IT'S NO ONE'S FAULT.
(woman) YES, IT IS.
IT'S MY FAULT.

13:36.246 --> 13:38.949
OH, KELLY, DON'T.
IF YOU HAD BEEN WITH HIM
AND THIS HAPPENED,

13:38.949 --> 13:40.250
I'D BE BLAMING YOU.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.592
I WOULD KILL YOU IF YOU HAD HIM
AND THIS HAPPENED.

13:42.592 --> 13:44.454
OKAY. I NEED
TO GET HIM IN THE C.T.

13:44.454 --> 13:47.257
I'VE ALSO ADDED AN I.V.
ANTIBIOTIC BECAUSE HE'S SEPTIC,

13:47.257 --> 13:49.459
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE'VE COVERED EVERYTHING.

13:49.459 --> 13:52.232
MAYBE HE ATE SOMETHING
OFF THE GROUND?

13:52.232 --> 13:55.235

WE HAVE ALL THE SAME THOUGHTS?

BUT IT'S KINDA GREAT.

TEDDY NEEDS SOMEONE TO COME IN

15:52.022 --> 15:54.324

BACK IN HER STEP.

15:54.324 --> 15:57.957
YEAH, AND FATHER HER CHILDREN.
YEAH. W-WAIT, WAIT. WHAT?
NO. MARK?

15:57.957 --> 16:00.430

16:05.295 --> 16:08.068

16:08.068 --> 16:10.070
FIRST SHE SAID NO.
THEN SHE SAID YES.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.302
OOH, THAT'S GOOD.
AND THEN SHE SAID NO AGAIN,

16:12.302 --> 16:15.145
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO HAVE A MEAL WITH ME.

16:15.145 --> 16:18.308
SHE JUST WANTED SEX. I MEAN,
WHO TREATS PEOPLE LIKE THAT--

16:18.308 --> 16:23.253
LIKE AN OBJECT,
A PIECE OF ASS?
WELL, UM, I THINK YOU DO.

16:23.253 --> 16:27.317

HATED EACH OTHER

18:57.237 --> 19:00.310
BY THE TIME I WAS BORN.
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.272
MOLLY THINKS
SHACKING UP'S ALL CUTE,

19:02.272 --> 19:05.275
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU PLAY
AROUND WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

19:05.275 --> 19:08.478
YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE CAN GET HURT.
YOU REALLY DON'T NEED
TO EXPLAIN.

19:08.478 --> 19:10.180
YOU THINK I'M A TURD,

19:10.180 --> 19:13.323
AND YOU'RE GETTING READY TO
SLICE ME OPEN WITH A KNIFE.

19:13.323 --> 19:15.355
(sighs)

19:15.355 --> 19:17.827
I'M SURE YOU'RE NOT A TURD.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.592
I THINK WE FOUND OUR PROBLEM.

19:22.592 --> 19:25.295
NOAH HAD A CYST ON HIS LIVER,
AND IT RUPTURED,

19:25.295 --> 19:28.198
AND THAT'S WHAT'S CAUSING
SO MUCH PAIN.
A CYST?
WHY WOULD HE HAVE A CYST?

19:28.198 --> 19:30.200
(Lexie) THEY CAN BE
CONGENITAL OR INFECTIOUS.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.842
THEY'RE USUALLY BENIGN, BUT THEY
CAN RUPTURE WITH PRESSURE.

19:32.842 --> 19:35.345
PRESSURE?
WHAT KIND OF PRESSURE?

19:35.345 --> 19:39.178
YOU MEAN LIKE A FALL? DID--
DID NOAH TAKE A FALL TODAY?
NO.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.181
OKAY, THE TRUTH IS, IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT CAUSED THE RUPTURE.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.454
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT
WE OPERATE RIGHT AWAY.

19:44.454 --> 19:47.357
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
WE WERE DOING BEAR HUGS.

19:47.357 --> 19:49.419
WE WERE--I-I HUGGED HIM.

19:49.419 --> 19:51.391
I HUGGED HIM HARD.

19:51.391 --> 19:55.325
THAT'S WHEN--
THAT'S WHAT DID THIS?
(monitor beeping erratically)

19:55.325 --> 19:58.197
(Jim) NOAH? NOAH?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
(Kelly) NO!

19:58.197 --> 20:00.500
(Jim) NOAH.
GREY, GET AN O.R.
WE'RE GOING NOW.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.472
(cries)

20:10.980 --> 20:14.784
I'VE DONE THIS 300 TIMES,
AND IT'S STILL NOT WORKING.

20:14.784 --> 20:16.786
I WENT TO EUGENIA.

20:16.786 --> 20:18.848
MM.

20:18.848 --> 20:20.850
SHE HELD UP TWO POSTAGE STAMPS

20:20.850 --> 20:25.224
AND ASKED ME IF WAS LOOKING
FOR THE 44-CENT OR THE 3.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.997
UM, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
WHICH ONE YOU PICKED.
I LEFT!

20:27.997 --> 20:30.360
LOOK... LOOK, LET ME TELL YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING

20:30.360 --> 20:32.362
ABOUT MY SURGICAL FIELD.
OKAY?

20:32.362 --> 20:35.435
I PREP MY SURGICAL FIELD
WITH SOAP AND WATER.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.838
I KEEP MY SURGICAL FIELD
THE WAY GOD MADE IT. OKAY?

20:38.838 --> 20:41.911
I DON'T NEED A MEMBER
OF THE UKRAINIAN K.G.B.

20:41.911 --> 20:45.244
WAXING IT SMOOTH
SO THAT IT CAN BE MISTAKEN

20:45.244 --> 20:47.647
FOR THE SURGICAL FIELD
OF A 5-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.649
I AM A WOMAN, AND A WOMAN

20:49.649 --> 20:53.983
WAS MEANT TO HAVE SOMETHING ON
HER SURGICAL FIELD.

20:53.983 --> 20:56.326
IF A MAN CAN'T DEAL
WITH A LITTLE SOMETHING

20:56.326 --> 20:57.787
ON THE SURGICAL FIELD,

20:57.787 --> 21:00.560
A LITTLE NATURE, A LITTLE GOD,

21:00.560 --> 21:04.434
THEN THAT MAN HAS NO BUSINESS
GETTING NEAR MY SURGICAL FIELD.

21:04.434 --> 21:06.436
FINE. I'M NOT PUTTING
A GUN TO YOUR HEAD.

21:06.436 --> 21:08.438
LET FREEDOM RING.

21:08.438 --> 21:11.941
DAMN IT. THIS IS NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE LIQUID.

21:11.941 --> 21:13.343
(sighs)

21:13.343 --> 21:16.346
(exhales)

21:17.777 --> 21:20.780
(voice breaking) WHAT IF
I'M NOT CUT OUT FOR THIS?

21:20.780 --> 21:23.753
YOU KNOW, WHAT IF I'M
NO LONGER... PATIENT ENOUGH

21:23.753 --> 21:27.317
OR STUPID ENOUGH
TO DEAL WITH THIS CRAP?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.624
COME HERE.

21:34.624 --> 21:36.326
COME HERE.
(whimpers)

21:36.326 --> 21:38.398
COME HERE.
(chuckles)

21:38.398 --> 21:40.400
YOU CAN DO THIS.

21:40.400 --> 21:44.033
YOU CAN DO THIS.
YOU CAN.
(chuckles)

21:44.033 --> 21:45.835
THIS CYST WAS MASSIVE.

21:45.835 --> 21:47.837
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DO A CHOLE

21:47.837 --> 21:50.340
'CAUSE OF
THE INTRABILIARY PRESSURE.
SHOULD I UPDATE HIS PARENTS?

21:50.340 --> 21:52.812
IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT LONGER
THAN WE SAID.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.914
UH, YEAH, SURE.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.946
WHAT DO I TELL THEM?
DOESN'T MATTER.

21:56.946 --> 21:58.948
I'M SORRY?

21:58.948 --> 22:01.521
UNTIL YOU CAN SAY
HE'S AWAKE AND HE'S FINE,

22:01.521 --> 22:03.753
THEY WON'T HEAR A WORD.

22:03.753 --> 22:06.325
THEY'LL JUST HEAR WHITE NOISE
AND SEE YOUR MOUTH MOVING.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.828
BUT GO. IT'S GOOD FOR THEM
TO SEE YOU.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.860
TRY TO KEEP YOUR FACE HAPPY.

22:10.860 --> 22:13.603
(suction gurgles)

22:17.036 --> 22:21.340
JACKSON AVERY.
PUT HIM ON OUR TEAM.
HEY, ARE YOU STACKING
THE DECK AGAIN?

22:21.340 --> 22:24.343
YOU'RE A SPY. DON'T THINK
THAT I DON'T KNOW IT.
AND WHO STARTED THAT BOULDER
ROLLING DOWN THE HILL?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.345
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
I'M SWITZERLAND IN THIS MOMENT.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.348
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT WHOEVER
GETS THE SURGERY SHOULD USE HIM.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.350
USE ME FOR WHAT?
HE'S A LIABILITY.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.123
AVERY IS NOT GONNA GIVE
THE AWARD TO HIS OWN GRANDSON.
UNH-UNH. I DON'T THINK--

22:34.123 --> 22:36.125
HE WON'T BE NAMED
A CONTRIBUTOR.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.888
IT'LL JUST GET MENTIONED
OVER THANKSGIVING...
NO. NO, I WON'T.

22:38.888 --> 22:41.391
THAT HE WORKED ON A TUMOR
THE SIZE OF A POSSUM.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:41.391 --> 22:43.833
THEY'RE FIGHTING OVER ME.
OR MORE THE IDEA OF ME.

22:43.833 --> 22:46.536
I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT--
HE'S HARPER AVERY BAIT.

22:46.536 --> 22:49.399
(Meredith)
DEREK'S WAITING FOR US.

22:49.399 --> 22:51.541
OKAY, THE HEART
IS BACK WHERE IT CAME FROM.

22:51.541 --> 22:53.943
DR. SLOAN?

22:53.943 --> 22:55.505
(Mark) TWO C's.

22:55.505 --> 22:57.647
YOU'RE JUST
GONNA EYEBALL IT?

22:57.647 --> 22:59.409
THIS IS WHAT I DO.

22:59.409 --> 23:00.910
IF YOU SAY SO.

23:00.910 --> 23:02.882
SYRINGE.

23:02.882 --> 23:06.015
WHOA. WHAT, ARE YOU AFRAID
I'M GONNA STAB YOU?

23:06.015 --> 23:08.387
NO NEEDLE.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.420
(monitor beeping erratically)
HE'S HYPOTENSIVE.

23:10.420 --> 23:12.422
YOUR IMPLANTS ARE SITTING
ON THE VENA CAVA.

23:12.422 --> 23:16.065
THERE'S TOO MUCH FLUID.
NO, THERE'S NOT.
JUST NEED TO REPOSITION IT.

23:16.065 --> 23:17.897
RELAX.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.398
THANK YOU.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.901
AN ABDOMINAL ENTRY
IS A SHOT IN THE DARK.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.403
THE TUMOR HAS SHOVED
EVERYTHING OUT OF PLACE.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.905
THE ANATOMY'S A MESS.

23:25.905 --> 23:29.108
NOW I'M PROPOSING
A THORACOABDOMINAL APPROACH.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.881
YOU WANT TO GO IN
THROUGH THE CHEST?

23:31.881 --> 23:33.883
IT'S RISKY, YES,
BUT NOT AS RISKY

23:33.883 --> 23:37.987
AS "I'LL OPEN UP THE ABDOMEN
AND TAKE A GOOD LOOK AROUND."
SNAP.

23:37.987 --> 23:40.920
YOU MAY END UP SEEDING
THE TUMOR IN THE LUNGS.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.122
THAT IS A DANGER, YES.

23:45.094 --> 23:47.196
IMPRESSIVE PROPOSAL.

23:47.196 --> 23:50.900
IT'S VERY...

23:50.900 --> 23:52.431
HMM.

23:52.431 --> 23:56.205
I THINK I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE
WITH DR. HUNT'S PLAN.

23:56.205 --> 23:59.168
HE DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN.
HE HAS AN ATTITUDE.

23:59.168 --> 24:00.870
IT'S MORE IMPROVISATIONAL.

24:00.870 --> 24:05.144
BUT GIVEN OUR SITUATION,
I THINK IT'S OUR BEST BET.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.477
THANKS, ALL OF YOU.

24:07.477 --> 24:09.448
(Owen) THANK YOU.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.481
(door opens)

24:11.481 --> 24:12.982
(blows air)

24:12.982 --> 24:14.484
(door closes)

24:14.484 --> 24:16.656
RICHARD, UH...

24:19.859 --> 24:21.861
I'M SORRY.
IT WAS A GOOD PLAN.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.193
HUNT'S JUST MAKES
MORE SENSE TO ME.

24:24.193 --> 24:26.896
YES, BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY
YOU'D DO IT.

24:26.896 --> 24:28.467
THAT'S YOUR STYLE.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.871
LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT YOUR NEW JOB.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.843
YOU MANAGE SURGEONS.

24:33.843 --> 24:37.246
YOUR JOB IS TO HELP THEM DO
WHAT THEY DO

24:37.246 --> 24:39.478
THE WAY THEY DO IT.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.481
NOT TO GET THEM TO DO
WHAT YOU WOULD DO.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.555
IT TAKES VISION, DEREK.

24:45.555 --> 24:47.717
AND YOU DON'T HAVE IT.

25:00.870 --> 25:02.732
(monitor beeping erratically)
(Alex) B.P.'s STILL LOW.

25:02.732 --> 25:04.934
DR. SLOAN.
WHEN PEOPLE RUSH YOU,
DOES IT USUALLY HELP?

25:04.934 --> 25:07.276
NO, BUT IT WOULD BE NICE
IF WE DIDN'T LET HIM DIE.
I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

25:07.276 --> 25:09.508
AND YOU THOUGHT
WE HAD NOTHING IN COMMON.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.181
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
PRESSURE'S COMING BACK UP.

25:12.181 --> 25:14.043
IMAGINE.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.286
(Teddy) DR. SLOAN.

25:17.286 --> 25:19.889
NICE WORK.

25:19.889 --> 25:21.190
WHAT, THAT?

25:21.190 --> 25:23.893
JUST A HOBBY.

25:23.893 --> 25:27.697
PROFESSIONALLY,
I'M MORE FOCUSED ON MY WORK

25:27.697 --> 25:30.159
AS A MALE ESCORT.

25:30.159 --> 25:31.831
(door opens and closes)

25:33.833 --> 25:36.535
WE WILL ISOLATE THE TUMOR
FROM THE BLOOD VESSELS

25:36.535 --> 25:38.537
THAT SUPPLY IT,

25:38.537 --> 25:41.010
AND THEN TRY TO EXTRACT IT.

25:41.010 --> 25:44.073
THAT'S THE PLAN? YOU'LL TRY?

25:44.073 --> 25:48.217
IS THAT A PLAN?
I WISH THAT I COULD BE
MORE SPECIFIC, BUT, UH...

25:48.217 --> 25:50.179
UNTIL WE KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH--

25:50.179 --> 25:54.253
NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT A PLAN.
THAT'S A DEATH SENTENCE.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.957
AUDREY--
MRS. TAYLOR, IF THIS WORKS,
IT IS NOT JUST A MONTH.

25:57.957 --> 26:00.129
IT IS A LONG TIME.

26:00.129 --> 26:02.692
IT'S A GAMBLE.
IT'S A HUGE ONE.

26:02.692 --> 26:06.095
YOU ARE GAMBLING AWAY
MY DAUGHTER'S WEDDING.
WELL, THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL CALL KIM RIGHT NOW,

26:06.095 --> 26:08.097
AND SHE'LL GET
A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE,

26:08.097 --> 26:10.600
AND SHE AND SCOTT COULD GET
MARRIED RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM,

26:10.600 --> 26:12.602
AND THEN WE COULD
STOP BOTHERING THESE MEN.
DON--

26:12.602 --> 26:14.604
YOU KNOW, YOU--YOU DON'T
EVEN LIKE WEDDINGS.

26:14.604 --> 26:17.306
THE SALMON WILL BE TOO DRY
AND THE FLOWERS

26:17.306 --> 26:19.749
WILL MAKE YOU SNEEZE,
AND KIM WILL BE ANGRY AT YOU

26:19.749 --> 26:22.281
BECAUSE WOMEN GET ANGRY AT THEIR
MOTHERS AT THEIR WEDDINGS

26:22.281 --> 26:24.984
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
THEY HANDLE THEIR STRESS.
STOP IT.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.617
DO YOU THINK THAT SHE CARES
ABOUT HER WEDDING?

26:27.617 --> 26:29.859
HER MOTHER IS DYING.
DON.

26:29.859 --> 26:34.223
THEY'RE TRYING TO OFFER YOU
A LIFE--A WHOLE, LONG LIFE.

26:34.223 --> 26:36.365
AND, NO,
THEY CAN'T GUARANTEE IT,

26:36.365 --> 26:38.367
AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA FIND,

26:38.367 --> 26:39.969
AND IT'S A GAMBLE.

26:39.969 --> 26:43.202
BUT HOW CAN YOU NOT TAKE THAT
CHANCE, BECAUSE OF A WEDDING?

26:46.876 --> 26:51.881
THERE'LL BE GRANDKIDS
AND--AND ARGUMENTS

26:51.881 --> 26:56.686
AND GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE,
AND SHE'LL NEED YOU FOR THOSE.

26:56.686 --> 26:59.288
AND I'LL NEED YOU.

26:59.288 --> 27:01.290
(cries)

27:04.754 --> 27:07.727
YOUR HUSBAND'S RIGHT.

27:07.727 --> 27:11.230
AND SO IS DR. HUNT.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.363
HE CAN'T FORESEE
WHAT HE'LL FIND IN SURGERY.

27:14.363 --> 27:18.037
BUT HE'LL SOLVE THAT
AS IT COMES.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.869
THAT'S THE PLAN.

27:21.310 --> 27:23.642
AND IT'S A GOOD ONE.

27:40.730 --> 27:42.231
HE DID GREAT.

27:42.231 --> 27:45.264
OH. OH.
HE'S JUST COMING OUT
FROM UNDER ANESTHESIA.

27:45.264 --> 27:48.067
AND HE'S PROBABLY GONNA BE IN
A LITTLE PAIN FROM THE SURGERY,

27:48.067 --> 27:51.200
BUT... HE'S GONNA BE FINE.
IS THIS GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN?

27:51.200 --> 27:54.043
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE'LL
DEVELOP A CYST IN THE FUTURE,

27:54.043 --> 27:56.706
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KEEP
AN EYE OUT.
THIS WAS...

27:56.706 --> 27:59.909
I HUGGED HIM. DO I NOT HUG HIM?
DO WE NOT WRESTLE?

27:59.909 --> 28:02.982
YOU DON'T THROW HIM
ON THE GROUND.
WELL, HE'S A BOY.
HE LIKES TO WRESTLE.

28:02.982 --> 28:04.984
IT'S NOT LIKE
I INITIATE IT.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.956
OF COURSE YOU HUG HIM.

28:06.956 --> 28:08.958
AND YOU WRESTLE.
YOU LIVE YOUR LIVES.

28:08.958 --> 28:11.260
AND IF HE HAPPENS TO BE
IN ANY GREAT PAIN,

28:11.260 --> 28:14.223
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT--
SO THERE ISN'T ANY KIND
OF PREVENTATIVE THING THAT--

28:14.223 --> 28:15.965
PLEASE LET HER FINISH.

28:15.965 --> 28:18.327
IT'S OKAY.

28:18.327 --> 28:20.229
I WAS DONE.

28:20.229 --> 28:21.400
(sighs)

28:21.400 --> 28:24.403
ARE YOU READY
TO SEE HIM?

28:24.403 --> 28:26.175
YEAH.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.717
HMM. SOMEBODY PAGED ME HERE.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.920
SHH.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.752
CONDOMS.

28:44.423 --> 28:47.396
I'M BUILDING CARTILAGE...
FROM JELL-O,

28:47.396 --> 28:49.158
AND YOU PAGED ME FOR--

28:49.158 --> 28:51.460
CONDOMS.
(whispers) THEY HAVE THEM
IN THE CLINIC.

28:51.460 --> 28:54.934
NO, NO. AM I SUPPOSED
TO BRING THEM?

28:54.934 --> 28:58.167
OH. (laughs) OH, MIRANDA.
(whimpers)

28:58.167 --> 29:00.910
(normal voice) YEAH, YEAH.
UM... GUY BRINGS THE CONDOMS.

29:00.910 --> 29:03.742
OKAY.
ANYHOW, I WOULD'VE PEGGED YOU
FOR THE DIAPHRAGM TYPE.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.015
WELL, I HAVE A DIAPHRAGM.

29:06.015 --> 29:08.077
DIAPHRAGMS
PREVENT PREGNANCIES.

29:08.077 --> 29:09.378
THEY DON'T PROTECT AGAINST

29:09.378 --> 29:11.180
THE RAFT OF
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES.

29:11.180 --> 29:13.422
YOU'RE A PHYSICIAN. AM I REALLY
EXPLAINING THIS TO YOU?

29:13.422 --> 29:14.924
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

29:14.924 --> 29:17.386
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?
LOOK, GUY BRINGS THE CONDOMS,

29:17.386 --> 29:19.488

PROVIDE THEM ON THE THIRD DATE

DYING TO SETTLE DOWN.

30:19.548 --> 30:21.590

IN, UH, DERM?
DINNER AND A CONVERSATION.
CAN'T WAIT.

30:24.553 --> 30:27.256

NO, LUNCH IS NOT ROMANTIC.

30:27.256 --> 30:28.557
WELL,

30:28.557 --> 30:30.259

31:13.202 --> 31:16.445
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE GOT.
I'M NOT PITCHING MY SOLUTION.

31:16.445 --> 31:19.878
I'M SAYING WE SHOULD THINK
A MINUTE.
OKAY, I'VE ISOLATED
THE BLOOD SUPPLY

31:19.878 --> 31:22.381
AND MOBILIZED THE LIVER,
BUT I CAN'T GET ENOUGH EXPOSURE

31:22.381 --> 31:25.384
TO GET TO THE TUMOR.
WHAT IF WE LIFT THE LIVER UP
AND GIVE YOU MORE VISIBILITY?

31:25.384 --> 31:27.386
WELL, THAT WOULD HELP
WITH THE PERIPHERY,

31:27.386 --> 31:30.619
BUT I CAN'T--I STILL
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE VESSELS.

31:30.619 --> 31:34.223
I WISH WE COULD TAKE--
JUST TAKE THE DAMN THING OUT.
WELL, WHY NOT?

31:34.223 --> 31:36.395
LET'S TAKE THE LIVER OUT.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.467
I CAN CLEAN OFF THE TUMOR
EX VIVO.

31:38.467 --> 31:40.970
YOU CAN WORK ON THE VASCULAR
SUPPLY IN THE CAVITY.

31:40.970 --> 31:43.602
WILL IT WORK?
NO ONE'S
EVER TRIED THAT BEFORE.

31:43.602 --> 31:47.006
SHE'S CRASHING. IF YOU'RE TRYING
SOMETHING, NOW IS THE TIME.

31:47.006 --> 31:50.909

OKAY, MORE LAPS.

32:16.235 --> 32:19.638

A BIT GROGGY.

32:21.610 --> 32:23.612

32:23.612 --> 32:25.474

32:25.474 --> 32:28.447
HOW DID HE SEEM?
DID HE SEEM UPSET OR...

32:28.447 --> 32:31.450
I JUST... I LOVE HIM.
AND I WAS A LITTLE CRAZY.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.723
I MEAN, HE PRACTICALLY HAD
A HEART ATTACK OR WHATEVER,

32:34.723 --> 32:36.725
AND I-I ACTED A LITTLE CRAZY.

32:36.725 --> 32:38.727
WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU LOVE SOMEONE

32:38.727 --> 32:40.459
MORE THAN HE LOVES YOU,

32:40.459 --> 32:44.463
THAT CAN MAKE YOU
A LITTLE CRAZY.

32:44.463 --> 32:48.067
IT CAN MAKE YOU
A LOT CRAZY.

32:50.599 --> 32:53.502
YOU KNOW, WEBBER REALLY
CAME UP WITH THE IDEA

32:53.502 --> 32:55.444
TO TAKE OUT THE LIVER.

32:55.444 --> 32:59.448
MAYBE IF OWEN, UH, AGREED
TO TAKE HIS NAME OFF OF IT.
WILL YOU GIVE IT UP?

32:59.448 --> 33:01.510
HUNT WAS
MORE THAN HALFWAY DONE

33:01.510 --> 33:04.453

EVEN SURFACED.

33:04.453 --> 33:06.455
THERE'S NO HARPER AVERY.
WASTE.

33:06.455 --> 33:08.257
NO, IT'S NOT A WASTE.

33:08.257 --> 33:10.259
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT
MY GRANDFATHER HAD IN MIND

33:10.259 --> 33:12.721
WHEN HE CAME UP
WITH THE STUPID THING--

33:12.721 --> 33:14.723
FIND SOME WAY
TO KEEP SURGEONS MOTIVATED,

33:14.723 --> 33:16.725
MAKE THEM TAKE IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL

33:16.725 --> 33:19.498
EVEN IF THEY'RE ALREADY
AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME.

33:19.498 --> 33:23.001
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT DID TODAY.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.003

WAS BROUGHT TO YOU
