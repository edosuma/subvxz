00:02.001 --> 00:05.233
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:05.338 --> 00:07.499
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.115 --> 00:16.878
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:20.186 --> 00:23.053
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell.</i>

00:23.156 --> 00:26.182
I still can't believe we got in.
This place is usually so packed on Sundays.

00:26.292 --> 00:28.988
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>In addition to its Sunday popularity...</i>

00:29.095 --> 00:32.895
<i>the bistro was also famous</i>
<i>for something called the Skip's Scramble</i>- 

00:32.999 --> 00:35.365
<i>an egg dish that contained</i>
<i>everything on the menu.</i>

00:35.468 --> 00:37.936
<i>Don't order the Skip's Scramble.</i>

00:38.038 --> 00:41.940
<i>Just more good luck. Everything's been</i>
<i>going so well since we started goin'out.</i>

00:42.042 --> 00:44.442
I think we've actually
gone out eight times now.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.535
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Which included a record-tying...</i>

00:46.646 --> 00:49.046
<i>three lovemaking sessions</i>
<i>in one night for Michael.</i>

00:49.149 --> 00:51.049
- Yes!
- <i>[Sally]Just think...</i>

00:51.151 --> 00:54.814
how different everything in our lives would be
if we'd gotten together in high school.

00:54.921 --> 00:57.151
Of course, I wouldn't
have had George Michael.

00:57.257 --> 01:01.091
We probably would've had
an entirely different kind of child.

01:01.194 --> 01:03.788
<i>[Techno]</i>

01:03.897 --> 01:06.559
I really hope
he's okay with us goin' out.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.930
We're very close.
We don't keep anything from each other.

01:09.035 --> 01:11.902
Oh, no, it's my Dad.
I'm supposed to be at work.

01:12.005 --> 01:14.599
You know, George Michael,
you worry too much.

01:14.707 --> 01:18.234
It's Sunday. You're allowed to
have a couple of hours off.

01:18.344 --> 01:21.609
You don't see me nervous
about being on my third Virgin Mary.

01:21.714 --> 01:24.182
Why would you be nervous?
There's no alcohol in a Virgin Mary.

01:24.284 --> 01:27.014
There isn't?
This is unbelievable.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.111
Can I get a virgin piña colada
when you get a chance?

01:29.222 --> 01:31.190
Now we'll get
things started.

01:31.291 --> 01:34.192
<i>Hi. This is so, uh</i>- 
<i>I was just</i>- 

01:34.294 --> 01:36.285
Hey, okay.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.489
I want to introduce you to Sally.
This is George Michael.

01:38.598 --> 01:41.089
- <i>My niece, Maeby.</i>
- It's nice to meet you.

01:41.201 --> 01:43.601
I just shut down the banana stand
for a half an hour.

01:43.703 --> 01:46.103
- I can keep it open late tonight if you-
- No. Hey. Come on.

01:46.206 --> 01:48.697
Make me sound like a taskmaster.

01:48.808 --> 01:52.039
But if- if you want to keep it open
an extra hour, you know.

01:52.145 --> 01:54.443
<i>So, this is Sally.</i>

01:54.547 --> 01:57.015
- Is she your girlfriend?
- No.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.608
- Yes!
- A little.

01:59.719 --> 02:02.813
<i>You know what? I'm gonna meet</i>
<i>you in a few minutes, okay?</i>

02:02.922 --> 02:05.550
- Okay.
- And maybe we'll work on
breaking that record, huh?

02:05.658 --> 02:08.217
Okay.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.626
She's a shot-putter.
And I'm dating her.

02:10.729 --> 02:13.528
<i>But I just want to make sure</i>
<i>that you're comfortable with everything.</i>

02:13.633 --> 02:17.125
<i>Well, of course. We could double-date.</i>
<i>You and Sally and me and Ann.</i>

02:17.237 --> 02:19.637
- Who?
- W-Ann.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.468
- Yes. Yes.
- Yeah, we had-

02:21.574 --> 02:24.236
Of course I know Ann.
Yeah, see, I didn't mean "who."

02:24.344 --> 02:27.643
I meant, uh, "her."
That's a great idea.

02:27.747 --> 02:30.238
- I love Ann.
- <i>Great.</i>

02:30.350 --> 02:33.581
Excuse me, ma'am.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.847
<i>George Michael, you said that</i>
<i>you couldn't come to church...</i>

02:35.955 --> 02:38.048
because you were working,
and now you're doing neither?

02:38.158 --> 02:41.093
That's quite a lot of sins
for a Sunday afternoon, don't you think?

02:41.194 --> 02:43.526
- Your virgin piña colada.
- And now you're drinking?

02:43.630 --> 02:45.996
No. We're just having
a little fun, you know.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.930
I think the church
and studying are fun.

02:48.034 --> 02:50.025
- I thought you felt the same.
- Well, I do.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.036
L- I like not having fun.

02:52.138 --> 02:54.038
I like your idea
of fun, I mean.

02:54.140 --> 02:57.007
Our idea of fun.
I like not having that.

02:58.945 --> 03:01.072
I'm going
back to church.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.843
Well, she just
killed my buzz.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.680
So, you're still
enjoying this relationship?

03:06.786 --> 03:09.414
I mean, I guess we've lost some of the heat
since we have kissed.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.683
<i>I mean, how do you</i>
<i>relight that fire?</i>

03:11.791 --> 03:14.419
But I can't break up with her. I always assumed
she would break up with me.

03:14.527 --> 03:18.258
Well, we may have to find
a way to speed that process up.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.026
<i>[Narrator] And later that day,</i>
<i>Michael caught Lindsay up...</i>

03:21.134 --> 03:24.729
<i>on the emotional bond</i>
<i>he was forming with Sally.</i>

03:24.837 --> 03:27.965
Oh, big deal, three times.
I've had three times plenty of times.

03:28.074 --> 03:30.065
Yes!

03:30.176 --> 03:31.973
Did you call my name?

03:32.078 --> 03:34.103
Absolutely not.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.273
I just hope that George Michael
is really okay with it.

03:36.382 --> 03:39.579
I think you're looking
for a reason this isn't going to work...

03:39.686 --> 03:42.883
because you can't handle happiness,
and you like to suffer.

03:42.989 --> 03:46.982
<i>Oh, how delicious!</i>

03:47.093 --> 03:49.584
Oh, hey, let's not spin
in the comfy chair.

03:49.696 --> 03:53.154
Look at this delicious piece of irony.
I'm being sued for divorce.

03:53.266 --> 03:55.393
- Me.
- Thought you were single?

03:55.501 --> 03:57.128
Yeah, I keep forgetting
that I got married.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.604
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Gob met a woman one night.</i>

04:00.707 --> 04:04.165
<i>And after a series of</i>
<i>escalating dares, married her.</i>

04:04.277 --> 04:06.074
Yes, but it's all
coming back to me now.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.806
<i>She was a seal dealer.</i>

04:07.914 --> 04:11.975
She raised and sold seals to aquariums
and marine parks, that sort of thing.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.646
Then she went off to fight her war
and left me to look after them.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.485
<i>[Narrator] It was while in the service</i>
<i>that her penchant for daring...</i>

04:18.591 --> 04:20.559
<i>found a natural outlet.</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:23.862
I've never known you
to look after a seal.

04:23.963 --> 04:26.659
Turns out it's a major hassle.
Tried to include one in my act once.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.633
There's a reason you don't typically
see live seals in a magic show.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.000
- So with a simple wave of my-
- <i>[Barking]</i>

04:33.273 --> 04:35.935
- Oh, look-it over... there.
- <i>[Barking]</i>

04:36.042 --> 04:38.533
Well, one of the "Desperate Housewives,"
looking so desperate.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.636
<i>[Cat Screeching]</i>

04:40.747 --> 04:43.910
So I released them from whence they came,
and now she's stomping on my heart.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.985
- What's her first name? Quickly.
- Krindy.

04:46.085 --> 04:48.315
Name's not Krindy, Gob.

04:48.421 --> 04:52.050
Ah, Saul Zentsman.
No, that's her lawyer.

04:52.158 --> 04:55.025
Well, she's got a name.
And I'm gonna find out what it is...

04:55.128 --> 04:58.564
and then I'm gonna make a pun on it,
and that's what I'll call her.

04:58.665 --> 05:00.792
Bad example- if her name's Amy,
I'll call her Blamy.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.891
That's a strong defense.
I'll tell you what.

05:03.002 --> 05:05.493
I'll help you look for Barry tomorrow.
I think Dad prepaid him...

05:05.605 --> 05:07.835
for Lindsay and Tobias's
divorce anyway.

05:07.940 --> 05:11.307
Look at us. Three relationships,
all falling apart.

05:11.411 --> 05:14.608
Maybe it's time we actually
took some responsibility for that.

05:14.714 --> 05:17.547
- I think it's Mom's fault.
- I was gonna say the exact same thing.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.210
- <i>[Grinding]</i>
- No, that's not a spinner.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.222
<i>So this is how my children</i>
<i>speak of me when I'm not here.</i>

05:24.324 --> 05:26.417
- What are you doin' here, Mom?
- <i>Your brother Buster...</i>

05:26.526 --> 05:28.494
wants to meet me
at the beach tomorrow.

05:28.594 --> 05:32.086
Do you know what this is about?
Because if it's about going in the ocean...

05:32.198 --> 05:34.598
the answer is
no, he's not going in the ocean.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.965
Well, there are
bigger dangers, Mom.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.335
Like, say, signing him up
for the army during wartime.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.499
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

05:42.608 --> 05:45.008
Michael Moore confronted me
in front of the whole country.

05:45.111 --> 05:47.671
First of all, it wasn't Michael Moore.
It was a look-alike.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.873
And it wasn't in front
of the whole country.

05:49.982 --> 05:51.916
It was for a bit
on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live.</i>

05:52.018 --> 05:54.418
I don't know who that is,
and I don't care to find out.

05:54.520 --> 05:58.081
<i>[Narrator] But the next day,</i>
<i>she did find out what Buster wanted.</i>

05:58.191 --> 06:00.785
Okay, I think we have enough
of you two kissing.

06:00.893 --> 06:03.862
Oh, I can't believe
you hired a photographer.

06:03.963 --> 06:07.023
<i>We haven't done this since</i>
<i>the</i> Balboa Bay Window <i>magazine.</i>

06:09.302 --> 06:12.362
So, I wanted you to have
a recent picture of me...

06:12.472 --> 06:15.407
because they want to ship me
out tomorrow with army.

06:15.508 --> 06:17.874
What?
To where?

06:17.977 --> 06:20.707
Iraq. And I just
might be out of options.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.713
I don't want to go,
but they keep-

06:22.815 --> 06:25.545
I know what this is about.
You want to go swimming in the ocean.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.551
Well, you can forget it.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.644
- I don't think that's what this is about.
- <i>Yes, it is.</i>

06:29.756 --> 06:31.917
He's trying to punish me
or something.

06:32.024 --> 06:35.516
- Whatever happened to "Keepin' It Fresh"?
- I was 30 years old then, Mother.

06:35.628 --> 06:38.995
I'm 32 now! And I'm not
trying to teach you a lesson.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.998
Well, I may not have
been a perfect mother.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.965
But, you know,
kids don't come with a handbook.

06:43.069 --> 06:46.505
<i>[Narrator] In fact, there are</i>
<i>thousands ofbooks written on child-rearing.</i>

06:46.606 --> 06:49.006
<i>But Lucille was in denial.</i>

06:49.108 --> 06:51.099
If he wants to
go swimming, let him.

06:51.210 --> 06:55.044
<i>[Narrator] And Buster was far from ready</i>
<i>to go swimming in the ocean.</i>

06:55.148 --> 06:57.412
[Shudders]

06:57.517 --> 07:00.452
<i>[Narrator] And later, Michael and Gob</i>
<i>tracked down their attorney...</i>

07:00.553 --> 07:03.886
- <i>Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>
- Thank you so much for coming down here.

07:03.990 --> 07:07.118
I've got a big case.
I'm representing Skip Church's restaurant.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.956
- I don't care.
- A waitress that works there is claiming...

07:10.062 --> 07:13.589
that by eating Skip's Scramble
several times a week is making her a fatty.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.997
<i>We need to speak to you</i>
<i>about getting a divorce for Gob.</i>

07:16.102 --> 07:19.333
- Oh, well, I got Michael
out of his marriage, didn't I?
- Actually, she died.

07:19.439 --> 07:23.603
- You're kidding. I've been
taking credit for that for years.
- Credit?

07:23.709 --> 07:25.939
- Who's their lawyer?
- Saul Zentsman. Do you know him?

07:26.045 --> 07:29.037
I have Chinese with him every
Friday night at Miss Temple's.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.981
- He's tough.
- I just want my wife back.

07:32.084 --> 07:33.813
Save it for the stand,
okay, Tom Jane?

07:33.920 --> 07:37.356
Fine. I'll get into this
as soon as I lose this case.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.221
You know who's defending
the fatty? Maggie Lizer.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.556
Maggie Lizer,
our old prosecutor?

07:42.662 --> 07:44.960
<i>[Narrator] Michael had an affair</i>
<i>with Maggie Lizer...</i>

07:45.064 --> 07:48.227
<i>while she was both pretending to be blind</i>
<i>and prosecuting the family.</i>

07:48.334 --> 07:51.531
<i>It was with her he'd first set</i>
<i>the three-time record.</i>

07:51.637 --> 07:53.605
Yes!

07:53.706 --> 07:56.300
<i>[Narrator] Their relationship</i>
<i>ended somewhat abruptly.</i>

07:58.778 --> 08:01.178
- Wow. How does she look?
- Well, she's get-

08:01.280 --> 08:03.180
If you ask me, bigger.

08:03.282 --> 08:06.012
- <i>[Narrator] She was bigger</i>- 
- Are you sure you're okay to go on?

08:06.118 --> 08:08.018
<i>Because she was pregnant.</i>

08:08.120 --> 08:11.214
It's not my belly we have to
worry about, Your Honor.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.485
It's Loretta's.

08:13.593 --> 08:19.498
<i>Being tempted day in and day out</i>
<i>by those Skip's Scrambles.</i>

08:20.533 --> 08:22.330
Bring 'em in, boys.

08:24.403 --> 08:26.337
<i>[Barry]</i>
<i>Oh, I'm cooked. They love her.</i>

08:26.439 --> 08:28.669
Tell you the truth,
I preferred it when she was blind.

08:28.774 --> 08:31.971
<i>[Narrator] And so, Michael caught up</i>
<i>with his onetime lover.</i>

08:32.078 --> 08:35.241
How you doin'?
Wow, you look... fantastic.

08:35.347 --> 08:38.749
Wow. Haven't seen you since we had
an affair and you ruined my career.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.945
Yeah, I was gonna call you
a couple of times, and then I just-

08:42.054 --> 08:45.046
I got to thinking, uh,
"What if she brings that up?"

08:45.157 --> 08:49.423
To tell you the truth, I am so relieved
not to be pretending to be blind anymore.

08:49.529 --> 08:54.466
It's actually taught me not to rely
on cheap tricks to get the jury's sympathy.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.694
<i>I'm sorry. I know I'm not</i>
<i>supposed to do this...</i>

08:56.802 --> 08:58.793
but we just spend
so much time in that box.

08:58.905 --> 09:02.136
- I knitted you something.
- [Gasps] Oh, Juror Number Four!

09:02.241 --> 09:06.541
Gosh, thank you. I feel so bad
I fought so hard to keep you off the jury.

09:06.646 --> 09:08.773
- Oh-
- Ms. Lizer, can I see you in my chambers?

09:08.881 --> 09:11.213
Oh. Yes, Your Honor.

09:11.317 --> 09:14.753
<i>[Narrator] In fact,</i>
<i>Judge Ping had a gift for Maggie too-</i>

09:14.854 --> 09:19.052
<i>an Ocean-Sounds Toddler Rocker</i>
<i>he'd asked his bailiff to assemble.</i>

09:19.158 --> 09:21.888
Too bad the trial's not going longer.
She could've knit you something that fit.

09:21.994 --> 09:24.155
I know.
I'm so big now.

09:24.263 --> 09:26.322
No, no, come on.
They look great.

09:26.432 --> 09:27.899
You look great.
You look fantastic.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.560
Last time I saw you was in
that jury box right there, wasn't it?

09:30.670 --> 09:32.763
- Wasn't it like a year ago?
- Oh, Chip, you know what?

09:32.872 --> 09:35.272
Can you take this
back to my house?

09:35.374 --> 09:38.036
[Maggie Strains]

09:38.144 --> 09:40.578
Actually, it's been about
eight and a half months.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.580
Eight and a half
months, huh? Wow.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.775
I see somebody has
been counting the, uh-

09:46.519 --> 09:50.319
Eight and a half months. Wow. Really?
Could've sworn it was a year.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.824
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Michael hadjust learned...</i>

09:54.927 --> 09:58.658
<i>that the woman he'd been intimate</i>
<i>with eight and a half months earlier...</i>

09:58.764 --> 10:00.595
<i>was eight-and-a-half</i>
<i>months pregnant.</i>

10:00.700 --> 10:02.861
- Didn't I use something?
- No.

10:02.969 --> 10:06.132
You thought
I was blind, remember?

10:06.238 --> 10:09.036
- Don't worry. You're not the father, Michael.
- [Exhales]

10:09.141 --> 10:10.301
- No problem.
- Really?

10:10.409 --> 10:11.808
- Right.
- You sure? I mean, uh-

10:11.911 --> 10:15.176
<i>I could be. What if I was?</i>
<i>Don't you want to discuss this maybe?</i>

10:15.281 --> 10:17.408
Michael, I haven't
heard from you.

10:17.516 --> 10:19.507
L- I really don't want
to hear from you now.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.179
Listen, if you're interested,
come to the baptism.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.552
You can hurl a Bible
at the baby.

10:24.657 --> 10:28.058
<i>[Narrator] And that night,</i>
<i>Michael met up with Sally...</i>

10:28.160 --> 10:31.129
<i>where he felt he needed</i>
<i>to be honest with her.</i>

10:31.230 --> 10:33.130
Sally...

10:33.232 --> 10:35.166
you need to know
about my child.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.167
George Michael.
He approves.

10:37.269 --> 10:39.965
No, there may be
another child in the mix.

10:40.072 --> 10:44.509
I ran into an ex.
We had a very messed up relationship.

10:44.610 --> 10:47.477
It was based totally on lies.
But she's pregnant.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.549
She said something that led me
to believe that it might be mine.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.108
- But you said she was a liar.
- Sh-She is.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.415
She said it
wasn't mine, so-

10:56.522 --> 10:58.581
- Why are you telling me this?
- Well, because obviously...

10:58.691 --> 11:01.057
if it is my child, I'm gonna
have to be responsible for it...

11:01.160 --> 11:03.424
and that's going to make things
awfully complicated for us.

11:03.529 --> 11:06.760
Michael, you know what? You're always
looking for things to get between us.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.766
First, it was
"What's your son gonna think?"

11:08.868 --> 11:10.768
And now you think
you're having a baby...

11:10.870 --> 11:13.065
because a woman who lies
told you you weren't.

11:13.172 --> 11:16.335
That's a great way to say that. We really do
communicate well, do you know that?

11:17.610 --> 11:19.475
<i>Are you insane?</i>
<i>You broke up with her because...</i>

11:19.578 --> 11:22.877
somebody who doesn't want you
might be pregnant with your baby?

11:22.982 --> 11:26.213
No, Sally broke up with me.
And as for Maggie...

11:26.318 --> 11:28.684
I didn't even know that
she was pregnant when I first saw her.

11:28.788 --> 11:30.779
All I could see was
her giant chest- box.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.757
She had this- Some people
call it a chest. I call it a box.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.760
She was holding this giant box.
Maybe I should've just stayed out of it.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.490
She did make it pretty clear
that she doesn't want me around.

11:39.598 --> 11:42.226
Come on, Michael.
She's probably not even pregnant.

11:42.334 --> 11:44.427
You said she was
carrying a big box?

11:44.537 --> 11:46.437
Pregnant women
tend not to do that.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.700
It did say "60 pounds" on it.

11:49.809 --> 11:51.902
Okay, l-I've done
this wrong.

11:52.011 --> 11:55.378
I should've found out whether it was a real
pregnancy before I told my dream girl about it.

11:55.481 --> 11:57.608
<i>[Gob] You know what I do, Mike?</i>
<i>Check their urine.</i>

11:57.717 --> 12:01.084
Make 'em pee in a cup,
and pee in a cup right in front of me.

12:01.187 --> 12:04.384
Yeah, well, thanks, Gob. But, uh, I think
we should just keep on lookin'.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.481
<i>I don't know how I can</i>
<i>make that sound like me.</i>

12:06.592 --> 12:09.823
So you get someone to break
into her house, rig the toilet...

12:09.929 --> 12:12.898
collect the pee, test it,
and expose the lie.

12:12.998 --> 12:15.558
I mean, I'd do it, but I'm goin'
through a divorce here, guy.

12:15.668 --> 12:18.432
Oh, a pregnancy test.
[Laughs]

12:18.537 --> 12:21.233
There's something we never had,
huh, Lindsay? Oh, no.

12:21.340 --> 12:24.173
We had to create our
little Frankenstein monster...

12:24.276 --> 12:27.336
out of science and money
and just a dash of-

12:27.446 --> 12:30.108
Maeby, what- H-How long
have you been standing there?

12:30.216 --> 12:32.844
- I just walked in.
- Just walked in. [Laughs]

12:32.952 --> 12:36.945
Seems like only yesterday you were
bursting forth from your mother's fertile womb.

12:37.056 --> 12:40.856
<i>[Lindsay] You know what? Tobias and I will</i>
<i>break into her house and get the specimen.</i>

12:40.960 --> 12:43.588
- We've been looking for a little excitement.
<i>- [Tobias] Yeah!</i>

12:43.696 --> 12:47.291
- It'll be fun. We will be like Tracy and Hepburn.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>

12:47.399 --> 12:51.665
- "What do you say, you old poop?"
- Oh, God, he's Hepburn.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.830
I am done with Buster.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.998
He pushes my buttons.
That's all he does.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.167
He also zips you up
and sands your elbows.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.713
Not anymore. No, no, no.
He's pretending he's going to war.

13:01.814 --> 13:04.214
Mr. Big Shot. God knows
what he's really doing.

13:04.316 --> 13:07.217
Wait a minute. He said he's
going to war? Aren't you worried?

13:07.319 --> 13:09.219
Oh, you're sounding
like your uncle.

13:09.321 --> 13:11.983
And I've had enough
of his attitude too.

13:12.091 --> 13:15.618
- The boy is going to war.
You're gonna have to face that.
- It's none of your business!

13:15.728 --> 13:17.628
He is my boy!

13:17.730 --> 13:19.857
- I need macaroons.
- Oh, you're high!

13:19.965 --> 13:23.731
Oh, well, you can win every argument like that,
but that does not make you right.

13:23.836 --> 13:27.704
I don't want you telling him
you're his father! I need ice!

13:27.807 --> 13:29.832
Can't you see you're in denial?

13:29.942 --> 13:32.410
- You're high!
- You're drunk!

13:32.511 --> 13:35.071
- Where did Buster say he was going?
- Iraq.

13:35.181 --> 13:38.241
Which is a shot at your father.
Thank God he's not here to hear this.

13:38.350 --> 13:41.547
- <i>[Howling]</i>
- Excuse me one second.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.088
- <i>It's the pipes.</i>
- <i>You know, Mother Lucille...</i>

13:44.190 --> 13:46.988
there's a psychological
concept...

13:47.092 --> 13:49.560
known as denial that I
believe you're evincing.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.722
It's when a thought
is so hateful...

13:52.832 --> 13:55.562
that the mind
literally rejects it.

13:55.668 --> 13:59.627
You are a worse psychiatrist
than you are a son-in-law...

13:59.738 --> 14:01.899
and you will never
get work as an actor...

14:02.007 --> 14:04.237
because you have no talent.

14:05.978 --> 14:09.744
Well, if she's not going to say anything,
I certainly can't help her.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.283
<i>[Narrator] And Maeby</i>
<i>saw a way to help her cousin.</i>

14:12.384 --> 14:14.750
I know how to get rid of Ann.
You put her in a room with Gangy.

14:14.854 --> 14:18.551
- She'll criticize her away.
- But what would Gangy
have to criticize about Ann?

14:18.657 --> 14:21.182
Oh, George Michael-

14:21.293 --> 14:23.454
<i>[Narrator] In the attic,</i>
<i>Michael met with George Sr...</i>

14:23.562 --> 14:27.362
- <i>who'd overheard about Buster.</i>
- He can't go. You can't let him.

14:27.466 --> 14:29.366
I command you.

14:29.468 --> 14:31.527
I really hate it when
you put on the God costume.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.764
<i>[Narrator] George Sr.</i>
<i>Had always worn the God costume...</i>

14:33.873 --> 14:36.433
<i>at the annual</i>
<i>Living Classics Pageant...</i>

14:36.542 --> 14:41.206
<i>where he and Buster re-created</i>
<i>Michelangelo's</i> The Creation of Adam.

14:41.313 --> 14:45.773
What if I never get a chance to reach out
and touch that hand of his again?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.149
- I gotta go to him.
- Pop, you're a wanted man.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.586
You cannot risk leaving
the attic all the time.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.919
Oh, when? When have I
ever left the attic?

14:53.025 --> 14:56.222
Two days ago. Right? Saw you
floating around the Ford dealership.

14:56.328 --> 14:58.796
Yeah, well, have you seen
the new Ford Mustang?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.798
You could hump that hood.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.596
<i>[Narrator] And Michael</i>
<i>set the plan in motion to get...</i>

15:03.702 --> 15:06.102
- <i>Maggie out ofher house.</i>
- Hi, Maggie.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.571
- Are you blind again?
- For the pizza guy.

15:08.674 --> 15:11.142
I give him a five.
I tell him to keep the change.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.507
What are you doin' here,
Michael? I'm with a client.

15:13.612 --> 15:15.375
- Is that the pizza?
- No!

15:15.481 --> 15:17.244
You'll get your pizza.

15:17.349 --> 15:20.477
She's taking the stand tomorrow.
I want to make sure it creaks.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.645
There's so much I don't
understand about the law.

15:22.755 --> 15:27.192
Look, Maggie, if this child is mine,
I really need to know.

15:27.293 --> 15:30.854
So can you spare a few minutes for someone
who might be the father of your baby?

15:30.963 --> 15:33.193
Of course I can.

15:33.299 --> 15:36.291
- Okay.
- But it's not you.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.773
Oh, for God's sakes.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.469
Oh, come on!

15:45.577 --> 15:47.807
[Scoffs] Fine.
Let me get Miss Fat Ass outta here...

15:47.913 --> 15:49.972
- and I'll meet you in the car.
- Okay.

15:50.082 --> 15:53.108
<i>[Narrator] Meanwhile,</i>
<i>on the other side of Maggie's house...</i>

15:53.218 --> 15:56.585
<i>Lindsay and Tobias were putting</i>
<i>their plan into action.</i>

15:56.689 --> 15:59.180
- I'm cloaking myself in her scent.
- Oh! She's not blind.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.191
Well, she was
when she bought this.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.193
- [Laughs]
- <i>[Footsteps Approaching]</i>

16:03.295 --> 16:05.661
- Oh, my God! That's her!
- Get in the tub!

16:07.499 --> 16:10.730
<i>[Narrator] Buster, meanwhile,</i>
<i>received an unexpected visitor.</i>

16:10.836 --> 16:13.964
I want you to know that
it's okay for you to hide.

16:14.073 --> 16:17.975
A man can hide.
There's a quiet courage in that.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.977
You're a good uncle.

16:20.079 --> 16:23.048
I'm not your uncle.
I'm your father.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.378
- What?
- Shh. Shh. Quiet courage.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.918
Quiet courage.
Hide.

16:28.020 --> 16:30.420
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>But Buster was confused.</i>

16:30.522 --> 16:33.082
You lied to me.
Uncle Oscar's my father.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.854
He just told me so. And maybe
you're not even my real mother.

16:35.961 --> 16:39.192
For all I know, Lucille 2
is my real mother. Oh!

16:39.298 --> 16:41.232
Buster, you were
never supposed to know.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.427
Oh, yeah? Well, here's something
you should know. I'm going to war!

16:49.575 --> 16:52.840
<i>[Narrator] Buster hadjust discovered</i>
<i>he'd been lied to by his parents.</i>

16:52.945 --> 16:55.209
I'm going to war!

16:55.314 --> 16:57.441
- You told him you were his father!
- I did no such thing!

16:57.549 --> 16:59.710
- You're high!
- You're drunk!

17:01.186 --> 17:03.086
[Gasps]
George.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.622
He must've come here
to say good-bye to Buster.

17:05.723 --> 17:09.215
<i>[Narrator] And that's when</i>
<i>Lucille snapped out ofher denial.</i>

17:09.328 --> 17:11.454
My baby's going to war.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.861
<i>[Narrator] Lindsay and Tobias</i>
<i>were gathering evidence...</i>

17:13.965 --> 17:16.127
<i>that Maggie</i>
<i>was truly pregnant.</i>

17:16.234 --> 17:18.135
<i>And they were</i>
<i>having fun doing it.</i>

17:18.237 --> 17:21.035
That's the first time we were
in the shower since our honeymoon.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.040
And this time, no tears.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.872
Tobias, this is the box that
Michael was talking about. "60 pounds."

17:25.978 --> 17:29.971
- <i>[Narrator] But it didn't weigh 60 pounds.</i>
- [Scoffs]

17:30.082 --> 17:33.745
<i>Michael was stalling Maggie,</i>
<i>and they were also having fun.</i>

17:33.852 --> 17:37.151
Sally Sitwell? You know,
I think I had her little play oven.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.724
Yeah, I know. It's a funny name.
But she's a doll.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.952
- Yeah, I had one.
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

17:42.061 --> 17:44.393
If you pull her hair,
she'd cry or something.

17:44.496 --> 17:46.293
This one kinda
does that too.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.662
- Hello.
- We got the pee, and we're gonna get it checked.

17:48.767 --> 17:52.498
But, listen, you should know that
that box that says "60 pounds"-

17:52.604 --> 17:54.799
it's actually
like two pounds.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.876
I think she's pregnant, Michael.
I mean, there's baby stuff here and-

17:57.976 --> 18:00.877
[Laughs] Tobias, stop it.
That's for the baby. It's not-

18:00.979 --> 18:03.106
- <i>We're having a really good time.</i>
- <i>Yeah?</i>

18:03.215 --> 18:06.412
- Well, I kind of am too.
- Bye.

18:06.518 --> 18:09.009
So, no more lies.
Tell me the truth.

18:09.121 --> 18:12.750
If-lf that baby is mine,
maybe we're meant to be together.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.261
Of course it is, Michael.

18:19.298 --> 18:22.233
<i>[Narrator] But that's when the Fünkes</i>
<i>discovered what was in the box...</i>

18:22.334 --> 18:24.325
<i>that was so easy to lift.</i>

18:27.272 --> 18:30.264
- That's what it is.
- Okay, the box was light 'cause
it had a fake stomach in it.

18:30.375 --> 18:33.003
It looks like she's faking it.
Oh, God. I hope you get this.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.977
Wait up, please.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.878
<i>[Narrator] And George Michael and Maeby</i>
<i>brought Ann to the penthouse...</i>

<i>in hopes that Lucille</i>
<i>would drive her away.</i>

18:40.819 --> 18:42.548
Isn't Ann great?

18:42.654 --> 18:44.451
- Oh, she's lovely.
- <i>[Narrator] Unfortunately...</i>

18:44.556 --> 18:47.320
<i>she was distracted by</i>
<i>the thought oflosing Buster.</i>

18:47.426 --> 18:49.155
Hey, do you have
any bread pudding?

18:49.261 --> 18:52.321
<i>'Cause you'd be surprised</i>
<i>how much this one can put away.</i>

18:52.431 --> 18:55.628
- Ha!
- Now that Buster's not here,
there's no one to finish it.

18:55.734 --> 18:59.067
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>if I ever eat again.</i>

19:05.811 --> 19:08.041
You know,
when times are tough...

19:08.147 --> 19:11.412
you can always turn to
the power of prayer.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.849
Here we go.

19:13.952 --> 19:16.546
- Show me.
- [Gasps]

19:16.655 --> 19:19.556
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>This was a big get for God...</i>

<i>and Michael brought</i>
<i>Maggie home to meet his son.</i>

19:22.094 --> 19:25.029
This is gonna be easy. He's been signing off
on everyone lately. Maybe he called.

19:25.130 --> 19:27.598
- [Lindsay's Recorded Voice]
- Hey, so what's the deal on Zuckerkorn?

19:27.699 --> 19:30.463
'Cause you know my fat case-
it's really pretty thin.

19:30.569 --> 19:33.732
- Lying, untrustworthy-
- Yeah.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.205
Plus, I heard he
hangs out at rest stops.

19:36.308 --> 19:38.208
No, no. I'm talkin'
about you, Maggie.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.210
I don't know why I'm surprised.
I shouldn't be.

19:40.312 --> 19:42.177
You're a liar.
You lie.

19:42.281 --> 19:45.273
Well, I mean, I <i>heard</i>
he hangs out at rest stops. Okay-

19:45.384 --> 19:48.945
And I keep buying it too. And so maybe
there is something wrong with me.

19:49.054 --> 19:50.919
I thought we were startin'
to trust each other.

19:51.023 --> 19:55.016
I got a message from my sister saying
there's a box at your house with a fat suit in it.

19:55.127 --> 19:58.119
- What've you got?
A different one for each trimester?
- You had your sister...

19:58.230 --> 20:00.926
- break into my house?
- Which one are you wearin' right now?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.933
Is this
the ready-to-burst model?

20:03.035 --> 20:06.129
Now, there's
zero trust here. Good-bye.

20:06.238 --> 20:09.264
It's been fun-

20:09.374 --> 20:11.934
- not.
- <i>[Narrator] Michael had hoped</i>
<i>something more dramatic...</i>

20:12.044 --> 20:13.875
<i>would have</i>
<i>come out ofhis mouth.</i>

20:13.979 --> 20:15.606
<i>Or at least more current.</i>

20:15.714 --> 20:18.740
Oh, you're so right, Michael.
I really can't be trusted.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.444
'Cause I'm fakin' it-

20:23.088 --> 20:24.988
not.

20:27.593 --> 20:30.153
Hello, Michael.
Well, my wife and I...

20:30.262 --> 20:34.528
finally had the thrill of seeing
a plus sign on a pregnancy test.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.726
You're gonna be a daddy!

20:39.071 --> 20:41.096

Arrested Development.

20:41.206 --> 20:43.572
<i>Barry gets a big break on his case.</i>

20:43.675 --> 20:46.235
The fat girl in my
Skip Church's case? Not fat.

20:46.345 --> 20:49.314
The attorney bought her a fat suit.
Oh! I've got another case.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.075
Maggie is suing you
for paternity.

20:51.183 --> 20:53.845
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And for the first time, Lucille prays.</i>

20:53.952 --> 20:56.512
Take something else from us.
Do whatever you have to...

20:56.622 --> 20:58.522
to keep my boy
from going to war.

20:58.624 --> 21:00.524

<i>Loose seal!</i>
<i>Watch out for loose seal!</i>

21:08.800 --> 21:10.859
I don't care about Lucille!

21:10.969 --> 21:12.869
She lies!

21:12.971 --> 21:14.996
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And then a seal bites offhis hand.</i>
