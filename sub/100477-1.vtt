CHRISTINA:
Billy, why are we doing this?

00:36.340 --> 00:38.299
BILLY: Oh, it's just
a couple of questions

00:38.342 --> 00:39.996
for posterity's sake.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.260
And you know how much work
I got to do.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.088
Just play along, Christina.

00:45.132 --> 00:47.003
-Well...

00:47.047 --> 00:49.962
Fine. Go ahead.

00:50.006 --> 00:52.400

you came to New York?

00:52.443 --> 00:54.793
Yes.

00:54.837 --> 00:57.753
Do you miss Louisiana?

00:57.796 --> 01:00.625
-Parts of it.
-Hmm.

01:00.669 --> 01:03.106
-What parts?
-The good parts.

01:06.283 --> 01:08.938
And what do you like
about New York?

01:11.027 --> 01:13.073
I like my work.

01:20.993 --> 01:23.344
I like being a mother.

01:32.222 --> 01:34.050
What are you thinking?

01:38.533 --> 01:42.319
That I wish I was

01:42.363 --> 01:44.365
as I am at working.

-All right.

This will likely be the best

Oh, no, I'm all right.
I ate on the plane.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.754
I just offered you crab.

That's not

Hey, um, do you mind
if I record?

03:59.064 --> 04:00.805
Your story's about BP?

04:00.849 --> 04:02.329
Pointe à la Hache.

04:02.372 --> 04:04.200
Uh, Katrina, the oil spill,

04:04.244 --> 04:06.071
how it kind of
affected things there.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.250
So, did you always fish?

04:10.293 --> 04:14.428
Well, I'm third generation,
but I was in the military.

04:14.471 --> 04:18.432
Before that, I was working on
an oil refinery for Gulf Oil.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.521
Well, what was it like
working for Gulf Oil?

04:20.564 --> 04:22.479
-They fired me.
-Why?

04:22.523 --> 04:25.090
I refused to pump dirty water
into the river.

04:25.134 --> 04:27.441
It took us generations

04:27.484 --> 04:30.313
to go from sharecropping
to independent.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.663
They destroyed us
with the oil spill.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.061
This was my wife.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.280
Whoa.

04:41.411 --> 04:43.631
-You married?
-Uh, I...

04:43.674 --> 04:45.372
just got out of something.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.765
She, um... she called
while I was flying, man.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.506
She's... she told me,

04:49.550 --> 04:51.813
"Don't even bother
stopping by."

04:51.856 --> 04:53.380
-Well...

04:53.423 --> 04:55.425
She probably doesn't mean that.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.558
Ah, she's probably right.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.124
Who's this?

04:59.168 --> 05:01.126
Christina Eames.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.694
She took these other photos.

05:03.738 --> 05:06.871
That was me in '84.

05:06.915 --> 05:09.047
-MICHAEL: She's great.
-Yeah.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.179
-She from here?
-Yeah.

05:10.222 --> 05:11.615
She moved to New York.

05:11.659 --> 05:13.269
She's a photographer.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.098
Hmm. That was...
Does she have more like this?

05:16.141 --> 05:19.275
Um, I'm sure she does.

05:19.319 --> 05:24.280
We lost contact, uh,
after she took off, or...

05:24.324 --> 05:26.587
I let her leave.

05:26.630 --> 05:29.677
30 years later, still trying
to figure that out.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.114
Why don't you just look her up?

05:32.157 --> 05:34.072
Too much time done passed.

05:34.116 --> 05:37.293
-Hmm. -I don't recommend
getting older.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.164
Less people to talk to,

05:39.208 --> 05:41.558
more time to go over
every regret.

06:26.037 --> 06:27.648
CHRISTINA:
My Mae,

06:27.691 --> 06:29.171

lurching through my body.

07:20.048 --> 07:23.399
I waited far too long
to face it squarely.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.837
I need to write my way
out of the mess I've made.

07:26.881 --> 07:29.623
I hope you won't
judge me too harshly.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.802
Sometimes the heart
can be so full of love,

07:34.845 --> 07:37.282
it's like a weight
on your chest

07:37.326 --> 07:40.242
making it impossible to move.

-Cool?

09:29.220 --> 09:30.613
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

Mae?

09:41.232 --> 09:42.756
-Yeah.
-Hey.

09:42.799 --> 09:45.062
Michael Block
from The Republic.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.587
Hey.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.506
Uh, after you called,

09:54.550 --> 09:57.118
I pulled all my mother's photos
from Pointe à la Hache.

09:57.161 --> 09:58.293
Oh, thanks.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.555
Yeah, since she died,

09:59.599 --> 10:01.775
I've been going through
all her things.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.211
We weren't expecting it.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.039
She didn't tell anyone
she was sick.

10:05.082 --> 10:07.519
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:09.043 --> 10:12.394
I saw some of Christina's work
in New Orleans.

10:12.437 --> 10:16.180
Um, the guy I was profiling
showed me a picture of her.

10:16.224 --> 10:19.009
-She hated when people
took photos of her. -Oh.

10:28.802 --> 10:32.719
He said the relationship ended
after she left Louisiana.

10:32.762 --> 10:35.547
Well, she wasn't good
at staying anywhere.

10:35.591 --> 10:36.897
Or with anyone.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.116
-Just ask my father.
-Mm.

10:39.160 --> 10:42.816
Um, maybe we shouldn't be good
at staying places.

10:42.859 --> 10:45.601
That sounds very mobile.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.691
Well, maybe.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.781
So I take it you're not walking
down any aisles anytime soon?

10:51.825 --> 10:54.392
Nope. Uh, what about you?

10:54.436 --> 10:59.223
Me? I broke up with my last
boyfriend after he proposed.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.095

11:18.765 --> 11:20.505

11:56.106 --> 11:58.848
maybe you could talk...

11:58.892 --> 12:01.329

12:29.096 --> 12:31.533
We should go to New Orleans
this weekend.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.187

that's fun.

What's so fun
about New Orleans?

12:37.539 --> 12:40.020

with Ashley Prentiss.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.559
Why are you bringing up Ashley?

12:57.602 --> 12:59.430
Because she is always
hanging around the harbor

for no reason,
trying to get your attention.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.565
-That's not true.

he needs to do better.

Ain't never gonna have nothing.

to make my lunches,

when I started smoking weed.

-Yeah.

-You never said anything.
-How could I say anything?

Did you read the letter?

15:46.684 --> 15:48.991
I couldn't at first.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.037
I just don't understand
why she couldn't tell me

15:51.080 --> 15:53.909
about her life
when she was still alive.

15:53.953 --> 15:58.914
Maybe to help you look at her
in another way.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.525
What other way?

16:01.569 --> 16:03.963
She wasn't just your mother.

16:04.006 --> 16:07.140
At some point, you're going to
have to forgive her

16:07.183 --> 16:11.100
and realize
she was just a woman...

16:11.144 --> 16:13.276
with flaws.

16:14.451 --> 16:17.454
A lot of flaws.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.065
Yeah.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.549
I'll get it. I'll get it.

16:25.593 --> 16:28.813
-GIRLS: Uncle Michael!
-Whoa. Hey.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.167
Look, we'll be just fine.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.516
Yeah, Harlem won't get

16:35.559 --> 16:36.821
that much landfall
from the hurricane.

16:36.865 --> 16:39.215
Uh, I did that job interview.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.043
Feel like it went well.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.784
I might get it.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.960
Wait, what job?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.180
: Man, do you listen
to anything we ever talk about?

16:47.223 --> 16:49.225
Brother, I'll be trying to,
but you know I have

16:49.269 --> 16:50.705
two kids under ten.
Come on, now.

16:50.748 --> 16:53.360
Associated Pressin London.

16:53.403 --> 16:54.926
Oh.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.103
You guys know how it is
in the City.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.279
It's... I'm feeling caught up,
you know?

16:59.322 --> 17:00.845
Sometimes it feels
like an accomplishment

17:00.889 --> 17:02.151
just to get to the subway.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.500
Plus, Tessa is saying

17:03.544 --> 17:04.980
I'm incapable
of any kind of change.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.069
Wait, I'm sorry, so...
so you want to move

17:07.113 --> 17:09.289
-because of Tessa?
-I'm not saying that.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.334
I mean, it kind of sound
like that.

17:11.378 --> 17:12.509
You hungry?

17:12.553 --> 17:14.076
Why would you ask him that?

17:14.120 --> 17:16.209
Don't give him no food.
We don't need to feed him.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.732
-: Why not?
-What you mean, "why not?"

17:17.775 --> 17:19.255
First of all,
he's a grown man, okay?

17:19.299 --> 17:20.474
And groceries are expensive.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.085
KYLE:
Mike, let me ask you this.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.391
All right?
And I'm serious.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.653
Are you actually done
with Tessa?

17:25.696 --> 17:26.915
Are y'all finished?

17:26.958 --> 17:28.525
Oh, we're finished.
Yes, finished-finished.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.397
Good.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.876
-Kyle.
-What?

17:31.920 --> 17:33.835
Okay, he was wasting her time.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.925
I wasn't wasting her time,
was I?

17:36.968 --> 17:38.709
Definitely. You was
definitely wasting her time.

17:38.753 --> 17:41.016
-SOFIA: Mom! Dad! -SANDRINE:
Mom, she took my book!

17:41.060 --> 17:43.888
Sandrine and Sofia.

17:43.932 --> 17:45.890
Okay, look, look,
how's the story coming?

17:45.934 --> 17:48.154
I interviewed this man
named Isaac.

17:48.197 --> 17:50.069
He reminds me of Dad.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.245
Uh, he kind of introduced me
to this woman.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.029
-Kind of?
-Yeah.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.032
She, um... she's the daughter
of somebody that he knew.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.121
Um, she's a curator
at the Queens Museum.

18:00.688 --> 18:02.994
-Come on, now. Already?
-"Already" what, man?

18:03.038 --> 18:04.518
You know what
I'm talking about, man.

18:04.561 --> 18:05.780
Already?
You, like, like her already?

18:05.823 --> 18:07.303
You trying to date
somebody again?

18:07.347 --> 18:10.263
It ain't my fault
I meet people while I work.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.308
And, uh, she's interesting,
you know?

18:12.352 --> 18:14.484
Oh, so-so-so she's interesting.

18:14.528 --> 18:15.833
Yeah.

18:15.877 --> 18:17.618
She's got a lot to unpack.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.272
Her mom just died.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.143
So, you're attracted to her
'cause her mama died?

18:21.187 --> 18:23.014
-Look...
-No, I...

18:23.058 --> 18:24.755
Beside the point. Turn around.
Let me... let me talk to you.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.366
W-Why don't you do me
a favor, okay?

18:26.409 --> 18:27.802
Take some time
to yourself, okay?

18:27.845 --> 18:29.456
Figure out what you
really want to do

18:29.499 --> 18:31.719
instead of jumping
into something again.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.677
I don't know,
I'd like to see her again.

18:33.721 --> 18:36.376
ASIA: Oh, those girls
are gonna drive me crazy.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.818
ISAAC : I didn't
know much about photography

18:43.861 --> 18:46.429
when she started
taking pictures,

18:46.473 --> 18:48.649
but I knew I liked
the way she saw me.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.955
Better than I really was.

19:39.700 --> 19:43.094
-Hi.
-Hi, baby.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.706
ISAAC: My ego probably
held me back the most,

19:45.749 --> 19:48.752
why I couldn't make it work
with Christina.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.537
I didn't know how to be
with a woman

19:50.580 --> 19:51.929
that I had to keep up with.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.413
MICHAEL: What would you
have done differently?

19:59.763 --> 20:01.678
ISAAC :
I would've gone after her.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.686
-Yo.
-What's up, man?

20:09.730 --> 20:11.862
Uh, you want to see a movie?

20:14.952 --> 20:16.911
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah, you.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.042

22:30.392 --> 22:32.655
So, you're not
gonna help me out?

22:32.699 --> 22:34.353
Fine.

22:34.396 --> 22:36.659
He's cute in
an innocent-looking way.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.226
He's kind of dewy.

22:38.269 --> 22:39.836
It's refreshing.

22:45.276 --> 22:46.626
-Yep.
-Oh.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.367
I need a drink.
Are you coming?

22:49.977 --> 22:51.370
ANDY:
Yeah.

22:53.502 --> 22:56.331
I didn't know you were coming.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.899
Well, you were supposed
to invite me, right?

22:58.942 --> 23:00.422
I'm sorry.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.989
-Next time.
-Uh-huh.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.773
How's your article coming?

23:03.817 --> 23:04.992
It's all right, you know.

23:05.035 --> 23:06.907
It's kind of moving slowly.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.909
-How come?
-'Cause, uh, well, you know,

23:08.952 --> 23:11.781
sometimes good things
take time to develop.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.133
RACHEL:
How do you know Michael?

23:16.177 --> 23:17.700
We work together.

23:17.744 --> 23:19.528
Are you a writer?

23:19.572 --> 23:20.747
Kind of.

23:20.790 --> 23:22.052
Why "kind of"?

23:22.096 --> 23:23.663
I'm an intern.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.926
An intern.

23:25.969 --> 23:27.754
Yeah, for now.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.540
-How old are you?

23:31.584 --> 23:33.194
Why does it matter?

23:33.237 --> 23:36.023
Of course it matters legally.

23:36.066 --> 23:38.242
I'm a solid 25...

23:38.286 --> 23:40.201
in a few months.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.118
How old are you?

23:46.207 --> 23:48.949
That's none of your business.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.472
What did you think
about the movie?

23:50.516 --> 23:54.215
Uh, to be honest,
I was a little distracted.

23:54.258 --> 23:56.173
-What?
-I...

23:56.217 --> 23:58.393
So I... so I kept
running back in my mind

23:58.437 --> 24:00.003
how you might respond,

24:00.047 --> 24:02.353
uh, to me asking you
for a drink after.

24:03.485 --> 24:04.834
So, that was you asking me?

24:04.878 --> 24:06.096
-That was elaborate.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.707
Well, in-in my mind,
it wasn't that forward.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.448
You know what I mean?
It was more...

24:09.491 --> 24:10.797
smoother than-than that.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.451
I was supposed to call you,
I thought.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.844
Yeah, you were supposed to.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.542
But you didn't.

24:16.585 --> 24:19.370
Well, I can't leave
my girl Rachel behind, so...

24:19.414 --> 24:20.633
Ah.

24:20.676 --> 24:23.897
Oh, it look like
Rachel already left.

24:23.940 --> 24:26.421
-MAE: Wow.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.684
-She's a great friend.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

24:28.728 --> 24:31.644
-She just disappear when you
need her to. -Just... Yeah.

24:31.687 --> 24:32.775
I-I like Kanye.

24:32.819 --> 24:34.211
-Yeah?
-But I'm just concerned

24:34.255 --> 24:36.083
that he don't care
about music no more.

24:36.126 --> 24:37.519
He does not. That's not a...

24:37.563 --> 24:39.521
-He don't care about us.
-That's a valid...

24:39.565 --> 24:41.218
-He does not care about us
anymore. -Uh-huh, uh-huh.

24:41.262 --> 24:42.916
He cares about interior design.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.787
-Like, when did he get into it?

24:44.831 --> 24:47.616
Like, I'm not trying to buy
Kanye pillows, you know?

24:47.660 --> 24:49.705
-That would be fine, actually.
-That would be.

24:49.749 --> 24:51.446
-I-I actually wouldn't mind.
-Yeah.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.231
-Yeah.
-Oh, okay, what about Drake?

24:54.275 --> 24:56.799
Drake, okay.
See, Drake, for me...

24:56.843 --> 24:58.801
Drake is like the homey.

24:58.845 --> 25:00.194
-Yeah.
-Like, you know, he's like

25:00.237 --> 25:02.239
a friend at school
who you know and...

25:02.283 --> 25:04.241
-And who knows us.
That's what... -Who knows us.

25:04.285 --> 25:06.374
That's what I like about him.
He's just in tune.

25:06.417 --> 25:07.549
-Yeah.
-You know, he's, like...

25:07.593 --> 25:09.333
in tune with his feelings

25:09.377 --> 25:11.553
and-and my feelings,
your feelings...

25:13.120 --> 25:14.338
Oh, no, you didn't.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.079
-Sorry. I...
-No, you didn't.

25:16.123 --> 25:18.560
I'm just bored by
the sentimentality, all that.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.388
-Okay, who... who do you like?
-But, uh...

25:20.431 --> 25:22.042
-Kendrick.
-Oh, no.

25:22.085 --> 25:23.783
Kendrick is my dude, for sure.

25:23.826 --> 25:25.219
-I mean, he's...
-I'm so sorry.

25:25.262 --> 25:26.786
What? You're telling me
you don't like Kendrick?

25:26.829 --> 25:28.004
No, that's... No, I-I love...

25:28.048 --> 25:29.353
No, I think he's great.
I just...

25:29.397 --> 25:30.964
Man, I'm about to flip
this table over.

25:31.007 --> 25:32.443
I just... No, hear me out.

25:32.487 --> 25:33.967
I just...
He makes me feel guilty.

25:34.010 --> 25:35.751
- Wait, how so?
-'Cause I can't...

25:35.795 --> 25:39.581
I just feel like, uh, everybody
can't be a change in the world.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.017
-Everybody can't do that.
-Oh, okay.

25:41.061 --> 25:43.019
-It's too ambitious.
-All right. Mm-hmm.

25:43.063 --> 25:44.934
-You know?
-You know what?

25:44.978 --> 25:46.675
Now that I think about it,
that is kind of ambitious.

25:46.719 --> 25:48.155
-Right? -Talking about,
we gonna be all right.

25:48.198 --> 25:49.460
-It's unfair.
-Yeah.

25:49.504 --> 25:50.940
-What if I don't want
to be all right? -Right.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.942
-Who knows if we're gonna be
all right? -Who knows that?

25:52.986 --> 25:54.988
Mm. Wow.

25:56.685 --> 25:59.079
Uh, see, I'm trying
to think of how to...

25:59.122 --> 26:01.081
trying to say something that,
you know...

26:01.124 --> 26:02.778
Uh, just trying
to be honest and...

26:02.822 --> 26:04.824
Oh, uh, being honest
is hard for you?

26:04.867 --> 26:06.347
-Mm-mm.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.436
It's just, I don't want
to say the same thing

26:08.479 --> 26:10.133
that I've said
to another woman.

26:10.177 --> 26:11.526
You know?

26:11.570 --> 26:13.397
Are there a lot of other women?

26:13.441 --> 26:15.182
No, there's a lot
of first dates.

26:15.225 --> 26:17.488
Yeah, I'm terrible
at first dates.

26:17.532 --> 26:18.794
-I just...
-Huh.

26:18.838 --> 26:20.753
No, I just don't know
whether to be

26:20.796 --> 26:23.103
vulnerable, aloof, funny.

26:23.146 --> 26:24.626
Why don't you just be yourself?

26:24.670 --> 26:26.497
I don't know who that is.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.151
- Fair enough.
-No, I-I mean,

26:28.195 --> 26:29.979
maybe I'm just a collection
of wrap dresses

26:30.023 --> 26:31.938
and Kehinde Wiley prints.

26:31.981 --> 26:34.767
I don't think so.

26:34.810 --> 26:37.944
You ever wonder
if we're just...

26:37.987 --> 26:40.990
if we're just who we're around
in the moment?

26:41.034 --> 26:43.384
I would think that it's
important that we pay attention

26:43.427 --> 26:45.168
to who we surround
ourselves with, then.

26:47.388 --> 26:49.042
True.

26:49.085 --> 26:50.696
Yeah.

26:52.436 --> 26:53.742
What?

26:56.397 --> 27:00.009
I'm wondering if it's not too
early in the night to kiss you.

27:30.779 --> 27:32.563
It wasn't too early.

27:32.607 --> 27:34.217
Ah. I see.

27:40.876 --> 27:42.661
What was it like?

27:42.704 --> 27:44.445
I don't know.
It felt like we...

27:44.488 --> 27:46.229
kissed before.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.102
Yeah, and he called me
right after.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.581
To say what?

27:50.625 --> 27:54.150
To say that he thought
that I was...

27:55.543 --> 27:56.936
Thought that you were what?

27:59.373 --> 28:00.853
Special.

28:02.245 --> 28:04.378
See? This is why
I can't tell you anything.

28:04.421 --> 28:06.336
I knew I shouldn't
have told you.

28:06.380 --> 28:08.382
-KYLE: Why do you keep
doing this? -Doing what?

28:08.425 --> 28:10.645
You know. You-you act
like you all in, right?

28:10.689 --> 28:13.343
And it don't even last longer
than what, 12 weeks?

28:13.387 --> 28:15.041
All right, well,
what about Tessa?

28:15.084 --> 28:16.390
What do you mean,
"What about Tessa?"

28:16.433 --> 28:17.696
Come on, bro, that only lasted

28:17.739 --> 28:19.132
'cause you didn't have
to see her every day.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.916
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.397
And by the way,
thank you so much

28:23.440 --> 28:25.442
for bailing on me
after the movie.

28:25.486 --> 28:28.489
Oh, Andy and I were
just pawns last night.

28:28.532 --> 28:30.621
We ditched you,
and then I ditched him.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.188
Okay.

28:44.505 --> 28:45.854
Where are you going?

28:45.898 --> 28:47.334
New Orleans.

28:47.377 --> 28:48.509
With who?

28:48.552 --> 28:50.467
Denise and Peter.

28:50.511 --> 28:52.078
Who else?

28:57.474 --> 28:58.911
Who else is going?

29:00.042 --> 29:02.001
Isaac.

29:02.044 --> 29:03.480
I'm spending the night.

29:08.224 --> 29:10.226
What are you planning to do?

29:10.270 --> 29:12.141
-In New Orleans?
-No.

29:12.185 --> 29:16.667
Christina, I'm asking what you
planning to do with your life.

29:16.711 --> 29:19.366
You can't just walk around town
taking pictures.

29:20.541 --> 29:22.369
How you plan to make money?

29:22.412 --> 29:24.240
Isaac can't take care of you.

29:24.284 --> 29:25.546
I don't want him
to take care of me.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.766
-You expect me to keep
taking care of you? -No.

29:32.858 --> 29:35.425
You're getting too old
to live with me.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.171
Are you telling me
I need to leave?

29:45.000 --> 29:49.788
I'm saying you'll probably be
more comfortable living alone.

29:53.269 --> 29:55.924
You should start looking
for a place that's yours.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.964
Come on, Christina.

30:36.008 --> 30:37.923

Denise?

is promising to be
a major event.

34:19.361 --> 34:21.494
This is a transitional
storm system,

34:21.537 --> 34:24.714
which means it's guaranteed to
be an absolutely perfect storm.

34:24.758 --> 34:27.674
A tropical depression that
morphs into a severe storm...

34:27.717 --> 34:29.110
-Whoa.

34:29.154 --> 34:30.677
Yeah. All right.

34:31.895 --> 34:33.114
What?

34:33.158 --> 34:34.463
Nothing.

34:34.507 --> 34:35.986
Then why you just look like

34:36.030 --> 34:37.292
you pulled out a win
in overtime?

34:43.211 --> 34:44.908
Mary's about to make landfall.

34:44.952 --> 34:47.215
Yeah, I don't think it's as bad
as people are saying.

34:47.259 --> 34:49.739
You know, it's probably closer
to, like, Hurricane Irene.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.959
Yeah.

34:52.002 --> 34:54.570
What?

34:54.614 --> 34:56.268

See, there's something
about these hurricanes--

34:59.793 --> 35:02.230

the museum,

told us to stay home
until the storm clears tonight.

35:34.088 --> 35:35.655
Yeah.

35:35.698 --> 35:38.397
All right,
we should bust a move,

so that way we don't end up
being stuck.

'Cause you're in
an evacuation zone.

a little bit of something.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.216
Okay, do a little bit of this.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.881
Yeah. Whiskey, please.

37:11.925 --> 37:14.101
-You want ice?
-Put them rocks on that.

Hey, man, look what happened.

45:26.158 --> 45:27.420
Man, you-you were
supposed to be here earlier.

45:27.463 --> 45:30.466
MICHAEL:
Yeah, I got stuck at her place.

45:30.510 --> 45:32.904
I'm sure.

45:32.947 --> 45:36.081
-ASIA: She's so nice.

45:36.124 --> 45:37.865
Why do you look like that?

45:37.909 --> 45:39.258
Look like what?

45:39.301 --> 45:40.825
Like you have a concussion.

45:40.868 --> 45:44.002
Or-or, like, she's Yoruba
and knows voodoo.

45:44.045 --> 45:45.394
-Okay.

45:45.438 --> 45:47.092
KYLE: Look at him, baby.
He's in love.

said that, all right?

45:48.789 --> 45:50.312
Brother,
you ain't got to say it.

45:50.356 --> 45:52.445
I can see it all over your face
with that sappy-ass look.

45:52.488 --> 45:54.012
-It's embarrassing.
-ASIA: Leave him alone.

45:54.055 --> 45:56.231
Yeah, leave me alone.

45:56.275 --> 45:57.798
What? What?
Baby, you're the one that said

45:57.842 --> 45:59.582
that she's Ya-rooba,
uh, Yor-ooba...

45:59.626 --> 46:00.801
- Yoruba.
-MICHAEL: Yoruba.

46:00.845 --> 46:03.325
First of all, uh,
she's not Yoruba.

46:03.369 --> 46:05.240
And-and what's that
got to do with anything?

46:05.284 --> 46:07.808
I was... I just meant
that she was really nice.

46:07.852 --> 46:09.810
-Yeah. Okay.
-And you seem smitten.

46:09.854 --> 46:11.725
-Look at her with the babies.
-KYLE: All right.

46:11.769 --> 46:13.814
Don't gas him up, 'cause he's
probably gonna fuck it up.

46:13.858 --> 46:15.337
Ah, maybe I won't.
You don't know that.

46:15.381 --> 46:17.426
I'm pretty sure about that.

46:17.470 --> 46:19.951
You guys are so pretty.
Tell me your names again.

46:19.994 --> 46:21.691
-Sandrine.
-Sofia.

46:21.735 --> 46:24.433
Well, I'm Mae.
Great to meet you.

46:24.477 --> 46:25.913
I thought your name was Tessa.

46:25.957 --> 46:27.393
You did?

46:27.436 --> 46:29.308
Uh, who's Tessa?

46:29.351 --> 46:30.657
Uncle Michael's girlfriend.

46:30.700 --> 46:33.007
She lives in New Orleans.

46:33.051 --> 46:35.488
It's not his girlfriend
anymore, Sofia.

46:35.531 --> 46:37.229
I forgot.

46:37.272 --> 46:39.361
I thought they were
gonna get married.

46:39.405 --> 46:41.450
What makes you say that?

46:41.494 --> 46:44.105
Because that's what
Uncle Michael said.

46:44.149 --> 46:46.107
SANDRINE:
You do look like her, though.

46:46.151 --> 46:47.761
So he has a type?

46:47.805 --> 46:49.415
What does that mean?

46:49.458 --> 46:53.332
Uh, when's the last time
you saw Tessa?

46:54.899 --> 46:57.684
Sandrine,
go read to your sister

46:57.727 --> 46:59.686
-until she falls asleep.
-Okay.

46:59.729 --> 47:01.340
But I can read, too.

47:01.383 --> 47:03.646
Okay, well,
y'all can read to each other.

47:03.690 --> 47:05.126
Thank you.

47:05.170 --> 47:07.825
I don't want to hear anything
up there except reading.

47:07.868 --> 47:09.870
Okay.

47:09.914 --> 47:13.787
-That deep sigh, little girl.

47:15.267 --> 47:17.878
ASIA:
So, we're at the reception,

47:17.922 --> 47:20.707
and everybody is
looking for Michael.

47:20.750 --> 47:22.448
Like, where is he?

47:22.491 --> 47:24.493
-He's supposed to do the toast,
and... -

47:25.930 --> 47:27.192
So, who...
Did he do the speech?

47:27.235 --> 47:28.758
-ASIA: No! -KYLE: No,
he didn't do the speech.

47:28.802 --> 47:30.282
KYLE: Our cousin...
our cousin Larry did it,

47:30.325 --> 47:31.587
and he stutters a lot,
and he was

47:31.631 --> 47:33.111
real nervous
'cause he didn't know he was

47:33.154 --> 47:34.503
gonna be talking anyways,
so now he extra stuttering.

47:34.547 --> 47:36.114
MICHAEL: Well, I got
stage fright. I didn't know...

47:36.157 --> 47:37.680
Yeah, stage fright. But then
you put Larry up there?

47:37.724 --> 47:38.899
MICHAEL: There's so many
good things to say

47:38.943 --> 47:40.161
about you,
I didn't know, you know...

47:40.205 --> 47:41.815
We had to edit it
out the wedding video.

47:41.859 --> 47:43.164
-Wasn't even that hard to find.
-ASIA: It was terrible.

47:43.208 --> 47:44.426
-KYLE: What did you wear?
-MAE: Where were you?

47:44.470 --> 47:45.775
I had a top hat on, like...
You... I mean...

47:45.819 --> 47:47.342
-A top hat? -Yeah.
I don't even know what I...

47:47.386 --> 47:48.430
ASIA:
Oh, gosh, the top hat.

47:48.474 --> 47:49.562
He wore a top hat.

47:49.605 --> 47:50.998
MAE:
What was the theme of the...

47:51.042 --> 47:52.913
-It wasn't no theme.
-There was no theme, Mae.

47:52.957 --> 47:55.002
-ASIA: There was no theme.
-KYLE: He wore a top hat.

47:55.046 --> 47:56.699
-Like, the wedding photos
look crazy -Oh, God.

47:56.743 --> 47:58.136
'cause everybody else got
a regular fade,

47:58.179 --> 48:00.442
-but he got on a Monopoly hat.

48:00.486 --> 48:02.314
-And I was trying to be nice.
-I just thought it was cool.

48:02.357 --> 48:03.663
It looked cool. It was...

48:03.706 --> 48:05.230
KYLE:
No, it didn't look cool.

48:05.273 --> 48:07.145
The kids kept asking you
to take a rabbit out of it.

48:07.188 --> 48:08.624
-You know what I mean?

48:08.668 --> 48:11.366
-Like, you looked stupid, man.
-Okay. -ASIA: Oh, God.

48:11.410 --> 48:13.368
People started playing
♪ Hi-de, hi-de, hi-de, ho.

48:13.412 --> 48:14.979
That's what he
looked like he was

48:15.022 --> 48:16.894
-supposed to be singing.
-MICHAEL: Oh, man.

48:16.937 --> 48:19.766
-Oh, gosh. Oh, goodness.

48:19.809 --> 48:22.987
I-I can laugh now,
but it was... it was not

48:23.030 --> 48:25.032
-very funny on the day of.
-She was really upset.

48:25.076 --> 48:27.339
I mean, I laughed at the day,
'cause I know you,

48:27.382 --> 48:29.036

It's our dynamic.

48:29.080 --> 48:30.951
Yeah, he-he does
stuff like that.

48:30.995 --> 48:33.780
He's very smart,
but he do dumb stuff.

48:33.823 --> 48:35.390
So, how about you tell me
what you do

48:35.434 --> 48:36.783
to keep, you know, whatever

48:36.826 --> 48:38.219

-ASIA: I mean, listen.

48:38.263 --> 48:39.612
-We talk about other people.

48:39.655 --> 48:41.309
-That-that makes us happy,
actually. -Ah, clearly.

48:41.353 --> 48:42.963
We go people watching.
That's what we do.

48:43.007 --> 48:44.356
ASIA:
He keeps me laughing.

48:44.399 --> 48:46.358
And really,
if it weren't for streaming,

48:46.401 --> 48:48.360
divorce would be
right around the corner.

48:50.014 --> 48:52.320
Wait, you would leave me
if we couldn't stream movies?

48:52.364 --> 48:53.843
Baby, I'm joking.
I'm joking.

48:53.887 --> 48:55.280
I'm joking, I'm joking.

48:55.323 --> 48:56.759
All right, I was, like, damn.

Baby, you are interesting.

49:00.372 --> 49:01.895
-KYLE: That's right.
-I-I was only joking.

49:01.939 --> 49:03.157

49:03.201 --> 49:05.464
-You know, don't worry.
-Wow.

49:05.507 --> 49:06.769
Y'all came in that storm?

49:06.813 --> 49:08.728
That storm is crazy.

49:08.771 --> 49:11.078
Look, what-what did y'all do
when the power went out today?

49:12.558 --> 49:14.299
Um...

49:17.258 --> 49:18.738

-Oh.

49:18.781 --> 49:20.348
-Okay, well, next topic.
-Okay.

49:20.392 --> 49:21.959
MICHAEL: What is all
those sounds about?

49:22.002 --> 49:23.699
Yeah, I mean, you know, once...

49:23.743 --> 49:25.919
You know, she did the little
sip and smile thing, like...

49:25.963 --> 49:27.094
Leave her alone.

49:27.138 --> 49:28.574
KYLE:
No, but we're all grown.

49:28.617 --> 49:30.271
Look, if y'all did it,
y'all did it.

49:30.315 --> 49:31.533

-Stop.

49:31.577 --> 49:33.013

-Mae...

49:33.057 --> 49:34.972

do-it weather. -Ooh!

49:35.015 --> 49:36.538

49:40.064 --> 49:42.022
Daddy?

49:42.066 --> 49:45.765
Y-Yeah, w-we'll be up there in
a second to-to tuck y'all in.

49:45.808 --> 49:48.028
Stop listening to
the grown-up conversations.

49:49.595 --> 49:51.031
Do not turn that TV on.

49:51.075 --> 49:53.947
-Do not turn the TV on.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.993
That's also marriage--
I just repeat what she says.

49:56.036 --> 49:58.038
I don't even know what to say
half the time.

49:58.082 --> 50:00.040
-ASIA: All right, we're going.
-KYLE: Know what I mean?

50:00.084 --> 50:01.520

50:05.698 --> 50:06.786
I'm just saying,
they-they already did...

50:06.829 --> 50:07.874
-ASIA: Let's go.
-MICHAEL: Good night.

50:07.917 --> 50:09.093
Don't be doing that

-See you in the morning.

51:21.034 --> 51:22.514
It's open.

51:26.866 --> 51:28.476
Smell good in here.

51:28.520 --> 51:29.912
What you cooking?

51:29.956 --> 51:31.175
Red beans and rice.

51:38.095 --> 51:39.444
Put that down.

51:39.487 --> 51:41.750
You are always
taking pictures of me.

51:41.794 --> 51:43.578
I want to have one of you.

51:58.941 --> 52:01.161
Don't you want more than this?

52:01.205 --> 52:03.163
What you mean?

52:03.207 --> 52:06.384
More... than what we have.

52:09.213 --> 52:10.431
No.

52:10.475 --> 52:12.259
I want you.

52:14.348 --> 52:16.002
I want to be married to you.

52:16.045 --> 52:17.525
I'm not ready to get married.

52:18.700 --> 52:20.224
What more do you want?

52:22.748 --> 52:26.360
I want people to know who I am,
admire my photographs.

52:26.404 --> 52:28.667
I love you, but my greatest
accomplishment each day

52:28.710 --> 52:31.757
cannot be cooking your dinner.

52:31.800 --> 52:35.413
I have never understood
how to make you happy.

52:35.456 --> 52:36.892
What if we moved?

52:36.936 --> 52:39.112
-Where?
-New York.

52:40.940 --> 52:42.724
I can't see myself there.

52:42.768 --> 52:45.162
I can't stay here anymore.

52:47.990 --> 52:49.905
And where does that leave us?

54:36.751 --> 54:37.752
Hey.

54:38.927 --> 54:40.494
Hey.

54:42.191 --> 54:43.976

-Yeah?

54:47.849 --> 54:49.590
You want to go outside?

54:51.070 --> 54:53.377
Do you want to go outside?

54:53.420 --> 54:55.379
Yeah.

55:02.603 --> 55:04.953
-MAE: We survived.
-MICHAEL: Yeah.

55:04.997 --> 55:07.695
Now we got the whole street
to ourselves, too.

55:10.916 --> 55:12.744
Who's Tessa?

55:14.833 --> 55:17.575
-Your nieces had a lot to say.

55:17.618 --> 55:21.143
Yes, she's a girl
that I used to date.

55:21.187 --> 55:22.623
When?

55:22.667 --> 55:24.059
Uh, a few months ago.

55:24.103 --> 55:25.670
A few months ago?

55:25.713 --> 55:27.498
Uh, few-few weeks ago,
actually.

55:27.541 --> 55:28.673
-Which is it?

55:28.716 --> 55:30.239
See, now I sound
like I'm lying.

55:30.283 --> 55:31.806
-Are you?
-No.

55:31.850 --> 55:33.808
-So...

55:33.852 --> 55:35.593
So, I...

55:35.636 --> 55:37.812
We broke up before I met you.

55:37.856 --> 55:40.554
She lives in
a different city, so...

55:40.598 --> 55:43.383
Why didn't you tell me?

55:43.427 --> 55:45.559
Because we're not together.

55:45.603 --> 55:48.823
And because I'm here
with you right now.

55:51.870 --> 55:53.654
So, what about you?

55:53.698 --> 55:55.395
What about me?

55:55.439 --> 55:57.354
Who are you talking to?

55:57.397 --> 55:59.399
Nobody, really.

55:59.443 --> 56:02.315
"Nobody, really."
What does that mean?

56:04.099 --> 56:06.624
Nobody anymore.

56:06.667 --> 56:09.061
MICHAEL:
Hmm.

56:11.324 --> 56:13.370
Listen, I, um...

56:15.328 --> 56:18.766
Maybe this
doesn't matter, but...

56:18.810 --> 56:22.291
What? What is it?

56:22.335 --> 56:25.817
I applied for a job...
in London.

56:27.122 --> 56:28.297
Oh.

56:28.341 --> 56:30.169
And, you know...

56:30.212 --> 56:33.215
It may not mean anything
because we just met.

56:33.259 --> 56:34.565
Right.

56:34.608 --> 56:36.654
But I think it matters.

56:41.136 --> 56:42.790
Why London?

56:44.705 --> 56:47.621
Well, I felt like
I needed a change.

56:50.363 --> 56:52.974
And you want a change
right now?

56:53.018 --> 56:55.455
-Well, not tonight, but...

56:57.718 --> 57:00.460
See, my-my brother
got me scared to say

57:00.504 --> 57:02.897
anything of consequence
to you, but...

57:05.987 --> 57:08.294
I want to continue
getting to know you.

57:11.079 --> 57:13.386
I want to get to know you, too.

57:17.129 --> 57:18.783
-Mommy. Come on!
-Sandrine!

57:18.826 --> 57:20.393
-All right, Kyle.
-Okay.

57:20.437 --> 57:21.960
-Guys.
-ASIA: What do you want to eat?

57:22.003 --> 57:23.483
I love you.
I'm-I'm gonna bring it back

57:23.527 --> 57:24.615
in two pieces for you, bro.

57:24.658 --> 57:25.920
What do you mean, "two pieces"?

57:25.964 --> 57:27.531
Okay, don't play with me
like that, all right?

57:27.574 --> 57:29.707
-Put some gas in there if you
get a ch... -

57:29.750 --> 57:31.273
Wait, what? You want what?

57:31.317 --> 57:32.840
SANDRINE and SOFIA:
Pancakes!

57:32.884 --> 57:34.494
Why are y'all yelling at me?

57:34.538 --> 57:36.061
-You in the kitchen
with your mama. -Pancake!

I just got a phone at home.

59:24.561 --> 59:25.736
I wish you was here.

59:25.779 --> 59:26.911
Christina,
you have to come home.

59:26.954 --> 59:28.477
I know.

59:28.521 --> 59:30.479
He must be furious at me.

59:30.523 --> 59:32.481
But I needed some time.

59:32.525 --> 59:35.136
I'm gonna talk to him,
and he'll understand.

59:35.180 --> 59:39.271
Hell, he might even
move here with me.

59:39.314 --> 59:41.229
How is he?

Your mother.

Is she okay?

59:55.983 --> 59:57.594
She died.

1:00:12.347 --> 1:00:14.393
CHRISTINA:
I think she asked me to leave

1:00:14.436 --> 1:00:16.525
because she knew she was sick.

1:00:16.569 --> 1:00:19.224
She didn't want me
to see her weak.

1:00:23.315 --> 1:00:25.230
I'm sorry, Christina.

1:00:37.372 --> 1:00:39.287
I thought he'd be here.

1:00:40.941 --> 1:00:43.291
He's angrier than I thought.

1:00:45.380 --> 1:00:47.295
I'm gonna go see him.

1:00:53.432 --> 1:00:55.477
There's something
you should know.

1:00:57.131 --> 1:00:58.655
What?

1:00:59.743 --> 1:01:00.874
He got married.

1:01:05.618 --> 1:01:07.925
Married to who?

1:01:07.968 --> 1:01:09.578
Ashley Prentiss.

1:01:09.622 --> 1:01:11.102
That's not funny.

1:01:13.844 --> 1:01:16.455
That's impossible.

1:01:16.498 --> 1:01:17.978
I've been gone three months.

1:01:18.022 --> 1:01:20.764
You should've said something
before you left.

1:01:20.807 --> 1:01:23.375
After the second month,
he was hung up on the idea

1:01:23.418 --> 1:01:24.681
that you weren't coming back.

1:02:12.641 --> 1:02:14.731
-Let's do one more of those.

1:02:18.299 --> 1:02:20.606
All right.

1:02:20.649 --> 1:02:23.914
-Good job. Move this way.

1:02:23.957 --> 1:02:26.655
Yeah, let me get you
right here.

1:02:26.699 --> 1:02:30.007
Look off out
into the window for me.

1:02:30.050 --> 1:02:32.357
-Yeah, right there.

1:03:20.753 --> 1:03:22.146
Come here, Mae.

1:04:15.373 --> 1:04:17.201
Peter said you were here.

1:04:18.637 --> 1:04:20.204
I sold Violet's house.

1:04:22.162 --> 1:04:24.251
It only took you four years
to come back.

1:04:27.341 --> 1:04:28.865
Hi, Isaac.

1:04:34.305 --> 1:04:36.263
How's New York?

1:04:36.307 --> 1:04:38.091
I like it.

1:04:41.834 --> 1:04:43.096
Who's this?

1:04:45.969 --> 1:04:48.145
My name's Mae.

1:04:48.188 --> 1:04:50.495
ISAAC: You look exactly
like your mother.

1:04:51.975 --> 1:04:54.151
She's beautiful.

1:04:54.194 --> 1:04:56.980
Thank you.

1:04:57.023 --> 1:04:59.330
Heard you got married.

1:04:59.373 --> 1:05:01.593
Congratulations.

1:05:04.988 --> 1:05:06.598
Thank you.

1:05:18.001 --> 1:05:19.437
Why...

1:05:21.004 --> 1:05:22.222
What?

1:05:26.096 --> 1:05:28.359
Why don't you
come over for dinner?

1:05:28.402 --> 1:05:30.665
Ashley would be
more than happy to cook.

1:05:30.709 --> 1:05:32.972
No. That's kind.

1:05:33.016 --> 1:05:34.408
No, really.

1:05:34.452 --> 1:05:37.629
No, we have a bus to catch.

1:05:43.461 --> 1:05:45.724
Can I drive you to the station?

1:05:45.767 --> 1:05:48.770
I didn't get a chance
to take you last time.

1:05:55.125 --> 1:05:56.865
Okay.

1:06:45.044 --> 1:06:46.959
Please don't get out.

1:08:45.251 --> 1:08:47.210
Can I help you?

1:08:51.039 --> 1:08:52.519
Hi. I'm Mae Morton.

1:09:01.267 --> 1:09:03.661
I'm Christina Eames's daughter.

1:09:11.016 --> 1:09:12.539
Is she here?

1:09:13.671 --> 1:09:14.846
She passed away.

1:09:27.119 --> 1:09:28.947
I'm sorry to hear that.

1:09:37.216 --> 1:09:39.131
When?

1:09:39.175 --> 1:09:41.655
About a month ago.

1:09:46.312 --> 1:09:49.446
She, um...

1:09:49.489 --> 1:09:51.883
left this for you.

1:09:51.926 --> 1:09:53.972
She asked me to give it to you.

1:10:05.026 --> 1:10:08.116
Do you know what it says?

1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:10.206
No, I didn't read it.

1:10:13.165 --> 1:10:15.733
I wasn't sure
she'd remember me.

1:10:15.776 --> 1:10:17.213
She did.

1:10:22.522 --> 1:10:25.090
She left me a letter, too.

1:10:25.133 --> 1:10:27.353
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:10:34.534 --> 1:10:37.320
It said I was your daughter.

1:10:58.993 --> 1:11:01.257
I was too afraid to ask.

1:11:01.300 --> 1:11:03.259
Ask what?

1:11:03.302 --> 1:11:04.869
When she brought you home,
I wanted to ask

1:11:04.912 --> 1:11:06.305
if you were mine.

1:11:11.310 --> 1:11:12.920
Why didn't you?

1:11:14.574 --> 1:11:16.794
I was married.

1:11:16.837 --> 1:11:19.492
She had a life in New York.

1:11:21.668 --> 1:11:26.673
I don't know, I had to believe,
if you were my daughter...

1:11:26.717 --> 1:11:29.067
she would've told me.

1:11:30.503 --> 1:11:34.507
She thought it would be
easier for you...

1:11:34.551 --> 1:11:37.075
not knowing.

1:11:43.342 --> 1:11:46.563
It would've been easier
if I just would've asked.

1:12:01.621 --> 1:12:04.189
Can you stay
for some boiled crab?

1:12:06.713 --> 1:12:08.411
Yeah.

1:12:11.022 --> 1:12:12.980
Hey.

1:12:13.024 --> 1:12:14.721
I need to talk to you.

1:12:16.506 --> 1:12:18.421
You're making me nervous.

1:12:18.464 --> 1:12:20.248
When are you ever nervous?

1:12:20.292 --> 1:12:23.643
When someone's like,
"I need to talk to you."

1:12:26.342 --> 1:12:27.647
What is it?

1:12:28.822 --> 1:12:30.650
I just found out I got the job.

1:12:30.694 --> 1:12:32.304
Oh, I can't believe you.

1:12:32.348 --> 1:12:34.306
I think the words
you're looking for are:

1:12:34.350 --> 1:12:36.743
"Congratulations. Good job."

1:12:36.787 --> 1:12:38.484
Congratulations.

1:12:38.528 --> 1:12:39.877
There you are. Thank you.

1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:41.531
I hope it doesn't work out.

1:12:43.446 --> 1:12:44.621
When do you start?

1:12:44.664 --> 1:12:46.057
Uh, a couple weeks.

1:12:46.100 --> 1:12:48.929
You still owe me a story--
before you go.

1:12:48.973 --> 1:12:50.104
Yeah.

1:12:52.237 --> 1:12:54.674
You sure you don't want me
to find you something else?

1:12:54.718 --> 1:12:56.981
-You know what you could do?
-Hmm?

1:12:57.024 --> 1:12:58.983
You could promote Andy.

1:12:59.026 --> 1:13:01.420
-Right?
-I'm not... I won't do that.

1:13:01.464 --> 1:13:03.901
-Maybe. Maybe.

1:13:03.944 --> 1:13:05.598
-Yeah.
-Unlikely.

1:13:07.687 --> 1:13:10.211
ISAAC : Maybe I
moved on because I was scared

1:13:10.255 --> 1:13:11.996
I couldn't make
Christina happy.

1:13:12.039 --> 1:13:13.432
MICHAEL:
What happened?

1:13:13.476 --> 1:13:15.129
ISAAC:
I was afraid of failing her,

1:13:15.173 --> 1:13:18.350
that she'd resent me
eventually.

1:13:38.718 --> 1:13:41.155
Okay, look, man,
you sure you want to do this?

1:13:41.199 --> 1:13:43.157
Yes. Yes.

1:13:43.201 --> 1:13:45.072
-Yeah.
-London, Michael? Huh?

1:13:45.116 --> 1:13:47.597
Like, for real,
you want to move to London?

1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:48.772
You understand
there's a five-hour

1:13:48.815 --> 1:13:50.208
time difference, right?

1:13:50.251 --> 1:13:52.166
Of course I know that.
Yes, I know that.

1:13:52.210 --> 1:13:54.517
Well, if you know that, then
have some respect for me, okay?

1:13:54.560 --> 1:13:56.519
What, you want me to change
my schedule around for you?

1:13:56.562 --> 1:13:57.955
Waking up in the middle
of the night,

1:13:57.998 --> 1:13:58.999
answering your phone calls?

1:13:59.043 --> 1:14:00.305
I don't want to be
doing all that.

1:14:00.348 --> 1:14:01.698
What's this look
I'm-I'm see...?

1:14:01.741 --> 1:14:04.265
Is this...
Oh, you're gonna miss me, huh?

1:14:04.309 --> 1:14:05.876
-Nope.
-You're gonna miss me.

1:14:05.919 --> 1:14:07.399
I ain't gonna miss...
No, I'm not.

1:14:07.443 --> 1:14:09.532
I'm not gonna miss you.
Stop playing with me.

1:14:09.575 --> 1:14:11.011
Okay, yes.
Maybe a little bit.

1:14:11.055 --> 1:14:12.622
-Oh, there it is, see.
-All right?

1:14:14.580 --> 1:14:17.931
Man, I don't know, I just...
I have to do this.

1:14:17.975 --> 1:14:19.933
I need this.

1:14:19.977 --> 1:14:21.500
You're not gonna talk to
this girl before you leave?

1:14:21.544 --> 1:14:23.023
-I don't know. I don't know.
-I think you should do that.

1:14:23.067 --> 1:14:24.460
-You're not gonna do that?
-I mean, she called,

1:14:24.503 --> 1:14:26.462
but I didn't call her back.

1:14:26.505 --> 1:14:28.681
Wait, you ain't
called her back?

1:14:28.725 --> 1:14:30.466
That's not like Michael.

1:14:30.509 --> 1:14:33.251
Well, I didn't...
I just didn't know what to say.

1:14:33.294 --> 1:14:35.819
And that's your plan, right?
Just gonna act funny?

1:14:35.862 --> 1:14:38.082
-Well, now, why you doing this?
-What...

1:14:38.125 --> 1:14:40.911
You're the one who told me
not to get involved, remember?

1:14:40.954 --> 1:14:42.652
You said... :
"Don't get involved."

1:14:42.695 --> 1:14:44.480
Okay, I didn't...
First of all, I don't sound

1:14:44.523 --> 1:14:45.785
like a mad scientist,
all right?

1:14:45.829 --> 1:14:47.091
- -That's not
how I talk, all right?

1:14:47.134 --> 1:14:48.527
And look, look,
I know what I said.

1:14:48.571 --> 1:14:50.050
I said don't get involved
too quickly.

1:14:50.094 --> 1:14:51.399
All right. Well, okay.
Semantics.

1:14:51.443 --> 1:14:52.792
'Cause that's what
you usually do.

1:14:52.836 --> 1:14:54.228
No, you always move
into this stuff fast, aight.

1:14:54.272 --> 1:14:55.795
That's all I was doing,
just being honest with you.

1:14:55.839 --> 1:14:58.058
Okay. Yeah.

1:14:58.102 --> 1:15:00.147
-Text her or something.
-Whatever. All right.

1:15:00.191 --> 1:15:01.584
DM her on Instagram.

1:15:01.627 --> 1:15:03.150
I don't know.

1:15:03.194 --> 1:15:05.065
Well, I mean, look,
you're-you're a grown man,

1:15:05.109 --> 1:15:07.198
and you got to do
what's best for you.

1:15:07.241 --> 1:15:08.329
Yeah.

1:15:10.941 --> 1:15:12.899
When do you leave?

1:15:12.943 --> 1:15:16.337
Uh, I'll go back to Louisiana
a couple days, finish up work.

1:15:16.381 --> 1:15:18.252
Then I'm packing.

1:15:22.169 --> 1:15:23.910
And don't make this
all dramatic.

1:15:23.954 --> 1:15:25.912
Come on,
give me some toast, huh?

1:15:28.306 --> 1:15:29.960
Come on, meet me over here.

1:15:30.003 --> 1:15:31.222
Get over here.

1:15:31.265 --> 1:15:32.528
Boom. There we go.

1:16:07.214 --> 1:16:08.999
What you doing here?

1:16:09.042 --> 1:16:10.783
Another interview.

1:16:10.827 --> 1:16:12.872
You almost done?

1:16:12.916 --> 1:16:14.613
MICHAEL:
Almost.

1:16:23.579 --> 1:16:25.842
I wasn't expecting that at all.

1:16:25.885 --> 1:16:28.714
I tried to call you
to tell you.

1:16:28.758 --> 1:16:30.324
You didn't call me back.

1:16:30.368 --> 1:16:31.630
Right.

1:16:31.674 --> 1:16:33.632
"Hi, Mae. Hello.
It's Michael.

1:16:33.676 --> 1:16:34.851
I'm calling you back."

1:16:34.894 --> 1:16:36.679
I could've said that.

1:16:36.722 --> 1:16:39.551
"Things were awkward
the morning after the storm,

1:16:39.595 --> 1:16:41.379
but that doesn't change
what happened between us."

1:16:41.422 --> 1:16:43.555
Oh, you're good.
No, I like that one.

1:16:43.599 --> 1:16:45.165
Thank you.

1:16:50.823 --> 1:16:53.130
Getting to know each other
was good.

1:16:53.173 --> 1:16:57.917
Yeah, well, I liked
getting to know each other.

1:16:59.049 --> 1:17:00.616
Yeah.

1:17:00.659 --> 1:17:04.010
So, what, you just leaving
New York and trading in

1:17:04.054 --> 1:17:06.360
the Kerry James Marshall
for the Bywater?

1:17:06.404 --> 1:17:08.058
Do you see me living here?

1:17:08.101 --> 1:17:10.800
Ah, I don't know.
I like this casual you.

1:17:10.843 --> 1:17:12.671
So, you're saying
I'm uptight in New York?

1:17:12.715 --> 1:17:15.805
Nah, I mean,
you just seem relaxed.

1:17:21.593 --> 1:17:27.468
I'm going to Christina's house
at Pointe à la Hache later.

1:17:27.512 --> 1:17:29.645
MICHAEL:
Mm.

1:17:29.688 --> 1:17:31.647
Do you want to come with me?

1:17:31.690 --> 1:17:32.822
Yeah.

1:17:32.865 --> 1:17:35.476
Yeah, I'd love to come.

1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:38.697
What you trying to listen to?

1:17:38.741 --> 1:17:41.047
Drake.

1:17:41.091 --> 1:17:44.094
-I... I cannot stand Drake.

1:17:44.137 --> 1:17:46.270
You know I don't want
to hear no Drake.

1:17:46.313 --> 1:17:48.620
All right,
put some Kendrick on.

1:17:48.664 --> 1:17:51.014
-Not in my car. Come on.

1:17:51.057 --> 1:17:52.450
I'm not putting on Kendrick.

1:17:52.493 --> 1:17:53.843
That is a fact.

1:17:53.886 --> 1:17:55.322
Depressing car ride.

1:17:55.366 --> 1:17:56.976
We're gonna get pulled over
by the police

1:17:57.020 --> 1:17:58.456
-listening to Kendrick.

1:17:58.499 --> 1:17:59.979
MAE :
It's...

1:18:01.764 --> 1:18:04.636
Did you say your ex-girlfriend
lived in New Orleans?

1:18:05.855 --> 1:18:08.031
I never said that.

1:18:08.074 --> 1:18:10.120
-You didn't?
-No.

1:18:12.122 --> 1:18:14.167
Okay, you know what,
you're right.

1:18:14.211 --> 1:18:16.561
It wasn't you.
It was... it was Sandrine.

1:18:16.604 --> 1:18:18.476
-Oh, my God.
-Or Sofia. Was it...

1:18:18.519 --> 1:18:20.217
Sandrine and Sofia again.

1:18:20.260 --> 1:18:22.262
All right, could you just
tell me everything they said?

1:18:22.306 --> 1:18:24.047
You just tell me now,
word for word.

1:18:24.090 --> 1:18:25.744
Why would I violate
the sister code?

1:18:25.788 --> 1:18:27.137
-Wow.
-No, I...

1:18:27.180 --> 1:18:28.834
Why don't you just
answer my question?

1:18:28.878 --> 1:18:31.358
Did you... did you happen
to see her while you were here?

1:18:31.402 --> 1:18:32.751
-See who?
-Your ex-girl.

1:18:32.795 --> 1:18:33.926
No.

1:18:33.970 --> 1:18:36.407
I have not seen her.

1:18:36.450 --> 1:18:38.365
Okay, you don't have to get
all defensive.

1:18:38.409 --> 1:18:40.759
-I'm not defensive.
-I'm just asking a question.

1:18:40.803 --> 1:18:42.369
I feel good.
Do I look defensive to you?

1:18:42.413 --> 1:18:43.501
Defenses are down.

1:19:35.379 --> 1:19:37.294
I guess no one's home.

1:19:39.992 --> 1:19:44.562
Uh, didn't you say, uh,
Christina had a darkroom?

1:19:44.605 --> 1:19:49.045
Yeah, in the back,
but I doubt it's there now.

1:19:49.088 --> 1:19:50.916
You want to check?

1:22:19.804 --> 1:22:21.545
Two champagnes, please.

1:22:21.588 --> 1:22:23.634
Two? Okay, coming right up.

1:22:27.420 --> 1:22:29.814
-For you, ma'am.
-MICHAEL: Thank you.

1:23:28.220 --> 1:23:30.266
We should move here.

1:23:31.441 --> 1:23:32.877
Or at least come back.

1:23:36.098 --> 1:23:38.143
When are you going back
to New York?

1:23:38.187 --> 1:23:40.537
'Cause I have a show
next Tuesday.

1:23:42.669 --> 1:23:45.194
I've been meaning
to tell you...

1:23:45.237 --> 1:23:47.848
What?

1:23:47.892 --> 1:23:50.068
I'm moving to London.

1:23:50.112 --> 1:23:51.983
-What?
-Yeah, I...

1:23:52.027 --> 1:23:53.767
I got the job.

1:23:53.811 --> 1:23:55.247
When?

1:23:57.423 --> 1:23:58.772
Could we just...

1:24:04.213 --> 1:24:06.215
I just... I just found out.

1:24:06.258 --> 1:24:08.173
Well, we were together all day.

1:24:08.217 --> 1:24:09.479
Why... why didn't you say
something?

1:24:09.522 --> 1:24:10.697
I-I know. I just...

1:24:10.741 --> 1:24:12.264
We were having a good time.

1:24:12.308 --> 1:24:14.571
You know, I didn't want
to, uh, mess it up.

1:24:16.268 --> 1:24:18.488
So, what do we do now?

1:24:19.750 --> 1:24:20.968
I don't know.

1:24:21.012 --> 1:24:22.187
Figure it out.

1:24:22.231 --> 1:24:23.971
-How?
-Well, I can go to...

1:24:24.015 --> 1:24:26.452
I can come to New York,
and you can come to London,

1:24:26.496 --> 1:24:29.151
and we could go back and forth
and we figure it out.

1:24:29.194 --> 1:24:30.761
It's not practical.

1:24:30.804 --> 1:24:32.980
I know. I'm not trying
to be practical right now.

1:24:33.024 --> 1:24:35.331
I... I want to be with you.

1:24:36.462 --> 1:24:38.943
Long distance never works.

1:24:38.986 --> 1:24:41.076
-What?
-It never works.

1:24:41.119 --> 1:24:44.122
Well, be optimistic.
Come on.

1:24:44.166 --> 1:24:47.343
I don't want to get together
just to break up.

1:24:47.386 --> 1:24:49.258
-I'm being honest.
-Honest?

1:24:49.301 --> 1:24:52.435
Yeah. I-I forgot,
you have trouble being honest.

1:24:52.478 --> 1:24:54.350
Okay, uh, so what...
what is that supposed to mean?

1:24:54.393 --> 1:24:56.352
Aren't you always searching
for something honest

1:24:56.395 --> 1:24:58.354
to say to a woman?

1:24:58.397 --> 1:25:00.747
Well, that's what
I'm doing right now.

1:25:00.791 --> 1:25:02.314
All right?
I'm being honest,

1:25:02.358 --> 1:25:06.057
and I'm saying
I want to try to be together.

1:25:09.974 --> 1:25:12.629
Maybe we should just
enjoy being here.

1:25:48.752 --> 1:25:50.710
Michael still in town?

1:25:50.754 --> 1:25:52.886
No, he left last night.

1:25:52.930 --> 1:25:55.324
Well, why you didn't
leave with him?

1:25:55.367 --> 1:25:57.369
'Cause I wanted to stay longer.

1:25:58.849 --> 1:26:01.852
I feel like that's not
the whole story.

1:26:01.895 --> 1:26:03.332
-It's most of it.

1:26:03.375 --> 1:26:05.725
I guess you more than look
like your mother.

1:26:07.597 --> 1:26:09.512
Yeah, I'm...

1:26:09.555 --> 1:26:12.776
probably more like her
than I'd like to be.

1:26:12.819 --> 1:26:15.039
Well, that's not a bad thing.

1:26:15.082 --> 1:26:17.520
She was unwavering
in everything she wanted.

1:26:17.563 --> 1:26:22.002
How could you say that,
after everything?

1:26:24.048 --> 1:26:26.093
I don't blame her for leaving.

1:26:28.052 --> 1:26:30.141
What did she say?

1:26:30.185 --> 1:26:32.317
What did the letter say?

1:26:33.579 --> 1:26:35.755
She apologized.

1:26:38.410 --> 1:26:40.804
She kept you from me
for so long,

1:26:40.847 --> 1:26:43.981
she didn't know how to go back.

1:26:44.024 --> 1:26:45.635
How to tell me.

1:26:51.684 --> 1:26:54.078
She asked me
to take care of you.

1:26:56.167 --> 1:26:58.213
I keep rereading mine.

1:27:00.302 --> 1:27:04.697
She wrote over and over again,
"My Mae."

1:27:09.876 --> 1:27:13.837
I keep reading those two words

1:27:13.880 --> 1:27:16.405
like they're evidence
that she loved me.

1:27:20.322 --> 1:27:22.628
She did.

1:27:22.672 --> 1:27:24.326
Very much.

1:27:49.133 --> 1:27:52.354
CHRISTINA: My Mae,
I didn't know how to love you

1:27:52.397 --> 1:27:55.400
except by showing you
the arc of a woman,

1:27:55.444 --> 1:27:57.446
by being a good provider.

1:28:05.497 --> 1:28:09.327
I put my love into work,
my photographs.

1:28:09.371 --> 1:28:13.766
Pictures took space
in my heart instead of people.

1:28:13.810 --> 1:28:15.986
It was the only way
I could love.

1:28:16.029 --> 1:28:17.770
I was stumbling
through my own life,

1:28:17.814 --> 1:28:20.251
trying not to break apart.

1:28:20.295 --> 1:28:23.820
I wish I had put as much
courage into being your mother

1:28:23.863 --> 1:28:26.344
as I was able to put
in my work.

1:29:39.939 --> 1:29:41.854
Evening, Mr. Morton.

1:29:44.161 --> 1:29:47.338
LOUIS: I told her
to tell you about Isaac.

1:29:47.382 --> 1:29:49.384
MAE:
What did she say?

1:29:49.427 --> 1:29:51.734
She made me promise
never to tell you.

1:29:51.777 --> 1:29:53.823
She thought it would
just confuse you

1:29:53.866 --> 1:29:56.303
and make his life harder,
so I agreed.

1:29:56.347 --> 1:29:57.870
Maybe I was wrong for that.

1:29:57.914 --> 1:30:01.004
And if I... if I am,
I'm sorry.

1:30:03.049 --> 1:30:06.357
When I first met her,
she was three months pregnant.

1:30:06.401 --> 1:30:07.663
And that didn't bother you?

1:30:07.706 --> 1:30:09.491
No.

1:30:09.534 --> 1:30:12.407
I couldn't look away from her.

1:30:12.450 --> 1:30:14.452
But she...

1:30:14.496 --> 1:30:16.454
she turned me down at first.

1:30:16.498 --> 1:30:19.065
-Why? -She thought
I felt sorry for her. I...

1:30:19.109 --> 1:30:20.719
And she-she told me
she didn't feel

1:30:20.763 --> 1:30:22.460
the need to be an honest woman.

1:30:22.504 --> 1:30:25.724
But I know
she was just hung up on him.

1:30:25.768 --> 1:30:28.074
So, why would she tell me now?

1:30:28.118 --> 1:30:31.600
Maybe it was her way
of explaining...

1:30:31.643 --> 1:30:33.297
Explaining what?

1:30:33.340 --> 1:30:36.082
Why she was the way she was.

1:30:36.126 --> 1:30:39.912
And why she was never
very good at...

1:30:39.956 --> 1:30:42.306
being your mother.

1:30:45.744 --> 1:30:48.399
Do you remember when
you were leaving for Chicago,

1:30:48.443 --> 1:30:49.661
for school?

1:30:51.315 --> 1:30:54.579
Yeah.
Mom didn't come to the airport

1:30:54.623 --> 1:30:57.582
'cause she said
she had to meet somebody.

1:30:57.626 --> 1:31:00.280
Like I wasn't moving
across the country.

1:31:00.324 --> 1:31:02.413
Like I wasn't more important.

1:31:02.457 --> 1:31:05.764
She didn't have to meet anyone.

1:31:05.808 --> 1:31:07.505
When I came home,
she was sitting

1:31:07.549 --> 1:31:09.725
in the back
of the house crying.

1:31:11.553 --> 1:31:14.512
Your mother wasn't
very good at goodbyes.

1:31:18.864 --> 1:31:21.998
I'm not a sentimental person,
as many of you know.

1:31:22.041 --> 1:31:23.652
I don't like
getting attached to people.

1:31:23.695 --> 1:31:25.741
-It makes it harder
to fire them. -

1:31:25.784 --> 1:31:28.134
And it makes it
that much more annoying

1:31:28.178 --> 1:31:29.614
when they abandon you.

1:31:29.658 --> 1:31:31.703
I'm not abandoning you.

1:31:31.747 --> 1:31:33.662
He's leaving, and he thinks
he's better than us.

1:31:34.924 --> 1:31:37.927
Well, let's all pretend
to wish him luck.

1:31:37.970 --> 1:31:39.668
-Good luck, Michael.
-OTHERS: Good luck, Michael.

1:31:39.711 --> 1:31:41.278
Thank you.

1:31:50.548 --> 1:31:52.942
We got more negatives
from Billy Wasko's archives

1:31:52.985 --> 1:31:54.204
for Christina's retrospective.

1:31:54.247 --> 1:31:56.162
Thanks.

1:31:57.381 --> 1:31:58.687
Are you heading out?

1:31:58.730 --> 1:32:01.037
Yeah. Dinner with Andy.

1:32:03.822 --> 1:32:05.607
I'm uncomfortable
with how happy you are.

1:32:05.650 --> 1:32:07.217
How do you think I feel?

1:32:07.260 --> 1:32:11.961
Being unhappy and jaded,
it's comfortable, but...

1:32:12.004 --> 1:32:14.398
But?

1:32:14.441 --> 1:32:16.879
I like him, and...

1:32:16.922 --> 1:32:19.882
maybe I'm not
who I thought I was.

1:32:19.925 --> 1:32:21.797
Maybe I'm different with him.

1:32:21.840 --> 1:32:24.539
So, you're choosing to be
a different person?

1:32:26.105 --> 1:32:28.978
I don't know. I'm just
choosing to be with him.

1:32:32.285 --> 1:32:34.157
What about you?

1:32:35.288 --> 1:32:38.074
I think I messed that up.

1:32:38.117 --> 1:32:40.293
It's like I said the opposite

1:32:40.337 --> 1:32:42.557
of everything that I wanted
to say to him.

1:32:44.341 --> 1:32:46.343
Well, what did you want to say?

1:32:47.997 --> 1:32:50.260
That I wanted him to stay.

1:32:53.480 --> 1:32:56.440
Can you still tell him that?

1:32:56.483 --> 1:32:59.486
I don't know. I...

1:32:59.530 --> 1:33:01.706
He looked at me
like he was so disappointed.

1:33:01.750 --> 1:33:03.926
I don't know, I-I felt like

1:33:03.969 --> 1:33:07.538
I couldn't ask him
to rearrange his life for me.

1:33:09.061 --> 1:33:10.672
It's too late. It's...

1:33:10.715 --> 1:33:11.760
Whatever.

1:33:14.023 --> 1:33:16.155
Have you selected
the final photos?

1:33:16.199 --> 1:33:18.201
Uh, almost.

1:33:18.244 --> 1:33:20.812
I'm just gonna go through
the rest of her archives

1:33:20.856 --> 1:33:23.989
and see if there's
anything else I want to show.

1:33:24.033 --> 1:33:25.425
Okay.

1:33:25.469 --> 1:33:26.949
Bye.

1:33:51.451 --> 1:33:53.540
-Yo.
-Yo.

1:33:53.584 --> 1:33:55.542
What's up?

1:33:55.586 --> 1:33:58.371
So, uh, did Sara tell you?

1:33:58.415 --> 1:33:59.590
What?

1:33:59.634 --> 1:34:01.897
I'm not an intern anymore.

1:34:01.940 --> 1:34:03.463
I'm a paid employee.

1:34:03.507 --> 1:34:05.335
-Boom.
-Boom.

1:34:05.378 --> 1:34:07.467
Oh, congratulations. Wow.

1:34:07.511 --> 1:34:09.121
Did you tell her to promote me?

1:34:09.165 --> 1:34:10.470
-No.
-Hmm.

1:34:10.514 --> 1:34:12.168
-Thank you.

1:34:12.211 --> 1:34:13.865
Whatever, man.

1:34:16.085 --> 1:34:18.609
Um, I'm gonna miss you, man.

1:34:18.653 --> 1:34:21.133
Oh, man, don't miss me.

1:34:22.918 --> 1:34:25.703
Oh, all right.

1:34:25.747 --> 1:34:28.401
-All right.

1:34:30.839 --> 1:34:33.363
I read your, um, article
on Pointe à la Hache.

1:34:33.406 --> 1:34:35.408
-What'd you think?
-It was...

1:34:35.452 --> 1:34:36.932
-It was personal.
-I-I know.

1:34:36.975 --> 1:34:39.543
Probably too personal.

1:34:39.586 --> 1:34:42.720
It became all about me
and my stuff.

1:34:42.764 --> 1:34:44.766
It's not often you meet
someone like that.

1:34:44.809 --> 1:34:46.071
Yeah, I know.

1:34:46.115 --> 1:34:48.639
Christina and Isaac, man,
that's an anomaly.

1:34:48.683 --> 1:34:50.510
I'm talking about Mae.

1:34:54.471 --> 1:34:57.126
The office is gonna be bleak
without you, man.

1:35:24.936 --> 1:35:27.722
BILLY :
Do you miss Louisiana?

1:35:27.765 --> 1:35:29.288
CHRISTINA :
Parts of it.

1:35:29.332 --> 1:35:31.813
BILLY:
Hmm. What parts?

1:35:31.856 --> 1:35:34.598
-CHRISTINA: The good parts.

1:35:34.641 --> 1:35:37.644
BILLY: And what do you like
about New York?

1:35:37.688 --> 1:35:39.516
CHRISTINA:
I like my work.

1:35:43.041 --> 1:35:44.651
BILLY:
What are you thinking?

1:35:46.218 --> 1:35:49.918
That I wish I was
as good at love

1:35:49.961 --> 1:35:52.181
as I am at working.

1:36:09.198 --> 1:36:12.331
I wish I didn't
leave people behind so often.

1:36:57.899 --> 1:37:00.162
Mr. Williams.

1:37:04.993 --> 1:37:06.646
Michael Block?

1:37:06.690 --> 1:37:08.170
Yeah.

1:37:52.649 --> 1:37:54.259
Sorry, bro.

1:37:55.870 --> 1:37:58.089
MAN: Want tickets
to Kendrick Lamar, anyone?

1:38:14.889 --> 1:38:17.413
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:38:19.197 --> 1:38:21.417
I just really felt like
seeing Kendrick.

1:38:22.679 --> 1:38:23.941
No, you didn't.

1:38:25.334 --> 1:38:27.075
I-I guess I'm lucky that,
you know,

1:38:27.118 --> 1:38:28.380
he was performing here tonight.

1:38:30.208 --> 1:38:32.558
And I-I really wanted
to see you.

1:38:32.602 --> 1:38:34.996
I've been wanting
to see you, too.

1:38:36.954 --> 1:38:39.043
I'm sorry for not...

1:38:39.087 --> 1:38:41.524
for not knowing what to say
before you left.

1:38:41.567 --> 1:38:45.615
I just didn't know
how to tell you how I felt.

1:38:45.658 --> 1:38:50.533
And I think I'm not
used to needing anyone.

1:38:50.576 --> 1:38:52.535
Yeah. I get that.

1:38:53.666 --> 1:38:56.017
But I need you.

1:38:56.060 --> 1:38:58.497
And I don't care
where you live. I...

1:38:58.541 --> 1:39:01.587
I just want to be close to you
as much as possible.

1:39:01.631 --> 1:39:03.720
I don't want to be practical.

1:39:03.763 --> 1:39:06.941
I want to figure it out.

1:39:06.984 --> 1:39:09.117
And I don't want
so much time to pass

1:39:09.160 --> 1:39:10.857
that we...
that we can't come back.

1:39:10.901 --> 1:39:12.947
-Yeah.
-And I... I don't want...

1:39:25.002 --> 1:39:27.178
You know,
we will always come back.

1:39:28.875 --> 1:39:30.312
Really?

1:39:31.966 --> 1:39:33.532
You know that.

1:39:37.319 --> 1:39:39.060
How's London?

1:39:39.103 --> 1:39:41.584
Uh, I-I've just been out here
being pathetic,

1:39:41.627 --> 1:39:42.977
-thinking about you.

1:39:43.020 --> 1:39:44.456
-That's good.

1:40:00.081 --> 1:40:02.561
You want to go hear some music?

1:40:02.605 --> 1:40:04.389
-Yeah.
-Come on.

1:40:10.830 --> 1:40:12.658
