00:01.501 --> 00:02.601
<i>My name is avery ryan.</i>

00:02.603 --> 00:04.536
<i>I was a victim of cyber crime.</i>

00:04.538 --> 00:07.606
<i>Like you, I posted</i>
<i>on social media,</i>

00:07.608 --> 00:09.408
<i>Checked my bank account</i>
<i>balance online,</i>

00:09.410 --> 00:11.377
<i>Even kept</i>
<i>the confidential files</i>

00:11.379 --> 00:13.612
<i>Of my psychological practice</i>
<i>on my computer.</i>

00:15.382 --> 00:18.350
<i>Then I was hacked,</i>
<i>and as a result,</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:20.486
<i>One of my patients</i>
<i>was murdered.</i>

00:20.488 --> 00:23.355
My investigation into her death
<i>led me to the fbi,</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:26.125
<i>Where I joined a team</i>
<i>of cyber experts</i>

00:26.127 --> 00:29.028
<i>To wage a war against</i>
<i>a new breed of criminal</i>

00:29.030 --> 00:32.097
<i>Hiding on the deep web...</i>

00:32.099 --> 00:35.134
<i>Infiltrating our daily lives</i>
<i>in ways we never imagined...</i>

00:36.636 --> 00:38.637
<i>...Faceless...</i>

00:38.639 --> 00:41.073
<i>Nameless...</i>

00:41.075 --> 00:42.608
<i>Lurking inside our devices,</i>

00:42.610 --> 00:45.310
<i>Just a keystroke away.</i>

01:02.629 --> 01:04.496
(hissing)

01:08.134 --> 01:11.203
(indistinct chatter over tv)

01:11.205 --> 01:13.205
(alarm clock beeping)

01:13.207 --> 01:16.708
(beeping, rapid trilling)

01:20.680 --> 01:22.581
(water pouring)

01:22.583 --> 01:25.584
(beeping,
indistinct chatter over tv)

01:30.190 --> 01:31.657
(drops remote, beeping stops)

01:33.660 --> 01:36.161
(indistinct chatter,
static crackles over tv)

01:36.163 --> 01:38.530
(man laughs, crowd chatter)

01:38.532 --> 01:41.433
(rock music playing loudly,
alarm clock beeping)

01:44.737 --> 01:46.572
(silence)

01:48.174 --> 01:49.842
(sighs)

01:58.785 --> 02:01.120
(faint clatter)

02:14.400 --> 02:16.335
(panting)

02:34.187 --> 02:35.787
(screams)

02:39.192 --> 02:41.660
(panting)

02:41.662 --> 02:43.462
â™ª

02:55.675 --> 02:57.910
(car horn honking)

03:02.916 --> 03:04.383
Hey, look out!

03:05.251 --> 03:07.753
(car horn blaring)

03:08.721 --> 03:09.755
Woman:
Hey!

03:09.757 --> 03:11.456
(tires screeching)

03:11.458 --> 03:12.457
Whoa.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.335
(tires screeching)

03:24.837 --> 03:25.938
Whoa!

03:27.240 --> 03:30.242
(rusty groaning)

03:32.612 --> 03:34.746
Been a while, rusty.
(grunts)

03:34.748 --> 03:37.583
Hey! Hey, take it easy.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.818
You don't text,
you don't call.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.954
I've been busy.
Besides, it wasn't me.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.255
What wasn't you?

03:43.257 --> 03:44.423
Whatever this was about.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.757
Part of being
a criminal informant

03:45.759 --> 03:47.259
Means taking our calls

03:47.261 --> 03:49.394
And providing
useful information to the fbi.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.331
Yeah. We heard
you got something useful.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.299
We got a tip
you were bragging about it.

03:54.301 --> 03:55.968
Bragging?
That don't sound like me.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.903
I'm a humble individual.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.571
(ryan and mundo laugh)

03:59.573 --> 04:02.307
Okay, then... We'll check
your devices then.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.875
We'll see what we find.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.711
All right. Wow.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.479
All the roughhousing's
unnecessary.

04:07.481 --> 04:10.916
I was just about to call you.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.883
Oh, okay.

04:12.952 --> 04:16.488
Came across something

04:16.490 --> 04:18.357
You might be
interested in.
Slowly.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.595
It's a hot new
piece of code.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.530
Just be careful
where you stick it.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.972
So much power
in such a small plastic case.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.841
Ryan:
Krumitz,

04:35.843 --> 04:37.709
If the connection's secure,
just plug in the flash drive.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.511
Oh. Right.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.912
Here we go.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.581
Let's see
if this actually works.

04:42.583 --> 04:43.749
(trilling)

04:50.857 --> 04:53.292
You okay?
Yeah.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.761
Just letting krummy
do his things.

04:55.763 --> 04:56.995
He's pretty excited about
all of this stuff, so,

04:56.997 --> 04:58.297
You know.
Mundo:
All right.

04:58.299 --> 04:59.464
Do we know what it does yet?

04:59.466 --> 05:00.666
Hey, hey, elijah,

05:00.668 --> 05:01.900
Let's just show, then tell.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.002
You know, I've got
a very full day, so...

05:04.004 --> 05:06.405
All right, all right,
it's almost unloading, okay?

05:06.407 --> 05:07.706
98, 99...

05:07.708 --> 05:10.942
And... Install.

05:12.545 --> 05:13.945
(printer whirring)
it's working.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.847
What's working?
You printing something?

05:15.849 --> 05:17.849
Wait for it, wait
for it. Trust me.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.718
You're gonna
want to see this.

05:23.956 --> 05:26.491
Whoa. There we go.
Now it's working.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.794
(laughs)

05:28.796 --> 05:29.861
Okay.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.963
Okay, okay. Oh.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.536
That was awesome.

05:38.638 --> 05:39.838
See, your c.I. Gave us

05:39.840 --> 05:41.573
Code hidden inside
a firmware update

05:41.575 --> 05:43.809
That disengages
the thermal switch of a printer.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.011
That switch regulates
the temperature of an ink fuser,

05:46.013 --> 05:47.379
You know, keeping it
from overheating.

05:47.381 --> 05:50.015
So now, when the paper loads,

05:50.017 --> 05:54.386
<i>It sparks, then the paper</i>
<i>in the tray ignites,</i>

05:54.388 --> 05:56.388
<i>Causing your printer</i>
<i>to catch on fire.</i>

05:56.390 --> 05:58.990
So the fuser is the match,
and the paper is the fuel.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.426
Krumitz:
Yeah. (chuckles)
sifter: Code sent

06:01.428 --> 06:02.894
From a computer
did all this?

06:02.896 --> 06:04.463
Krumitz:
It's pretty amazing, huh?

06:04.465 --> 06:05.630
Ryan:
That's terrifying.

06:05.632 --> 06:06.865
Someone's figured out

06:06.867 --> 06:08.934
How to set a fire
through the internet.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.069
Where'd you get this?

06:11.071 --> 06:13.638
At an office supply store.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.007
Do you want to play games?

06:16.009 --> 06:17.676
The code, rusty.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.778
The code in the flash drive--
who gave it to you?

06:19.780 --> 06:21.446
What makes you think
I didn't write it?

06:21.448 --> 06:23.014
You're not that smart.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.750
You're a step above
script kiddie.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.619
Hey, I was, uh, gonna try
and help you guys out,

06:27.621 --> 06:29.121
But if you're gonna insult

06:29.123 --> 06:30.956
My skills...

06:30.958 --> 06:32.924
It's incredibly
sophisticated code.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.593
It highlights a big flaw

06:34.595 --> 06:36.495
In public electric printers.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.829
Manufacturer didn't even
know about it.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.965
It's a legitimate
zero-day vulnerability.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.534
I know. I was gonna try
and sell it to them.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.636
Big companies pay
good money for

06:44.638 --> 06:47.839
That's why hackers spend so many
hours searching for them.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.041
I figured I could get
at least a grand for that,

06:50.043 --> 06:51.777
Whether it worked or not.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.712
It's one thing to sell
flaws to friendagenda.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.680
It's another
to walk around

06:55.682 --> 06:56.782
With detailed instructions

06:56.784 --> 06:58.850
On how to remotely
set a fire.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.819
Oh, is...

07:00.821 --> 07:03.588
Is that against the law?

07:03.590 --> 07:05.757
I was just trying to
earn a living here.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.992
This is my business.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.727
Now it's our business.
If you didn't write

07:08.729 --> 07:09.795
The code, who did?

07:09.797 --> 07:10.996
I don't know.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.898
I traded for it on the wire.

07:12.900 --> 07:13.899
Deep web user?

07:13.901 --> 07:16.701
I don't remember
that kind of thing.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.770
I would tell you if I did.
I would.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.909
You guys

07:23.911 --> 07:25.744
Look like you don't...
Believe me.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.612
(knocking on glass)

07:30.917 --> 07:34.753
I searched recent reports of
electrical fires across the u.S.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.755
Most were faulty wiring,
appliances left on

07:36.757 --> 07:38.890
Or too many plugs
in one outlet, but

07:38.892 --> 07:41.693
One in louisville,
kentucky, stood out.

07:41.695 --> 07:46.164
An unexplained power surge that
set her printer on fire.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.233
This was two nights ago.
Mm-hmm.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.572
Stupid thing.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.874
Avery and I are headed out.
I'll call you when we touch down

07:55.876 --> 07:57.943
In louisville.
All right.
I'll be ready.

08:00.847 --> 08:03.715
What happened?
Where's michelle?

08:03.717 --> 08:05.650
She's fine, elijah. I
just need to talk to you.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.018
You haven't returned my
messages, so I thought that...

08:07.020 --> 08:08.854
Yeah, I know, I know.
I've been crazy busy.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.856
I'm on my way to the airport
now. I'll call you from the car.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.658
This is not something I want
to talk about over the phone.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.960
I wouldn't be here

08:14.962 --> 08:16.495
If it wasn't important.

08:16.497 --> 08:17.896
Mundo:
<i>Wow.</i>

08:17.898 --> 08:19.931
A naval flight instructor.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.968
Uh, that's a great
opportunity for you.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.003
It's gonna be tough
for michelle and me to visit you

08:25.005 --> 08:27.138
In san diego, but we'll get
out there as often as we can.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.974
I was hoping that michelle could
live with me.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.543
(sighs, stutters)

08:31.545 --> 08:33.845
No, michelle's not moving
to san diego.

08:33.847 --> 08:37.883
Our daughter spends most of her
time with me anyway, elijah.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.985
With your work, and as
much as you travel, it's...

08:39.987 --> 08:41.152
My father helps out.

08:41.154 --> 08:44.289
That she sees her grandfather
more than she sees her dad.

08:44.291 --> 08:48.560
About custody or about
your new job opportunity?

08:48.562 --> 08:51.596
Devon, no more changes.
Michelle stays with me.

08:52.298 --> 08:53.932
I got to go.

08:57.904 --> 08:59.971
(trilling)

09:22.028 --> 09:24.095
â™ª

09:51.924 --> 09:54.759
â™ª

10:03.936 --> 10:04.970
(typing)

10:04.972 --> 10:06.905
Krumitz, I got the chip.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.808
It should tell us if malicious
code ignited the printer.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.710
Sending it to you right now.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.378
Woman:
<i>We're suing the landlords.</i>

10:13.380 --> 10:15.947
I mean, there should have been
sprinklers in here, right?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.983
Well, your apartment's
not up to code.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.752
But fortunately, the fire
department responded quickly,

10:20.754 --> 10:22.153
And stacie was able
to get out alive.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.922
Kate, you weren't here
when this happened?

10:23.924 --> 10:25.924
I spent the last week in florida
with my parents.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.993
And I never even opened
her door, until...

10:27.995 --> 10:30.395
(screams)

10:30.397 --> 10:32.163
You told the investigators
you thought

10:32.165 --> 10:33.798
That your apartment
was possessed?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.166
Right before the fire,

10:35.168 --> 10:38.837
All the appliances suddenly
came to life.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.271
(alarm clock beeping,
rock music playing loudly)

10:42.742 --> 10:45.110
How elaborate is
your wi-fi password?

10:45.112 --> 10:47.078
Our... Wi-fi?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.347
It's as important as the lock
on your front door.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.882
What does that have to do
with the fire?

10:50.884 --> 10:52.984
Well, the evidence shows
that the fire started

10:52.986 --> 10:54.753
Inside the printer in your room.

10:54.755 --> 10:58.056
More likely a cyber intrusion
into your router.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.025
<i>Without a good password,</i>
<i>anyone can invade your network</i>

11:00.027 --> 11:02.994
<i>And access your devices.</i>

11:02.996 --> 11:06.931
All the people you know
who have tech skills--

11:06.933 --> 11:08.833
Maybe an ex-boyfriend who has
a degree in computer science?

11:08.835 --> 11:11.069
Wait a minute, you think
someone we know did this?

11:11.071 --> 11:12.137
You're saying we were hacked?

11:12.139 --> 11:13.338
It's a possibility.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.874
No one was in this apartment
all week but me.

11:15.876 --> 11:19.411
They would only need remote
access to kate's computer.

11:19.413 --> 11:23.148
If I'm right about this,
this fire was not an accident.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.216
It was arson.

11:30.056 --> 11:35.694
â™ª I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise â™ª

11:37.296 --> 11:43.435
â™ª I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes â™ª

11:43.437 --> 11:47.839
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

11:47.841 --> 11:51.276
â™ª I can see for miles
and miles â™ª

11:51.278 --> 11:55.013
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

11:55.015 --> 11:58.917
â™ª and miles and miles

11:58.919 --> 12:02.253
â™ª and miles...

12:02.255 --> 12:04.322
â™ª oh, yeah.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.801
â™ª

12:21.073 --> 12:23.408
Hey, yo!

12:23.410 --> 12:24.843
Fellas?

12:24.845 --> 12:26.077
Come on, quit wasting ammo.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.813
Fellas!
No, just kill him.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.281
Guys!

12:30.283 --> 12:32.817
(chattering)

12:32.819 --> 12:34.085
What's up?!

12:40.760 --> 12:42.260
Quest!
Hey, yo, you acting like

12:42.262 --> 12:43.862
You seen a ghost, man.
What's up, man?

12:43.864 --> 12:45.230
What's up, dude?
What's up, boy?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.265
Hey, man.
What's up?
Icarus, what's up?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.366
Where you been?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.034
Man, I been in d.C. Mostly, man.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.102
He is wearing a tie, dude.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.470
I know, and a vest.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.839
You're right, I do.
I have a tie and vest.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.241
And I do have on
dress shoes, okay?

12:56.243 --> 12:58.877
That's right, man,
I been working.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.179
Work? What's that? Work?
I don't know, man, what's work?

13:01.181 --> 13:05.083
Something both of
you guys need: Jobs.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.384
You see what I'm saying?

13:06.386 --> 13:08.052
Y'all clowning on me already.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.922
All right, see what happens
when one of you guys get busted.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.323
Be just like me--
be a I.T. Guy

13:12.325 --> 13:14.225
Working at a real estate
firm in arlington.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.061
Clock punchers--
that's real scary.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.264
Hey, uh, where's meta?
Is he still living here or...

13:19.266 --> 13:21.199
Sort of. We don't really
see him around much anymore.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.967
Things have changed
ever since you left.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.169
That's crazy.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.170
Loser buys pizza?

13:25.172 --> 13:26.271
House rules.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.373
Come on, man. Pizza?

13:28.375 --> 13:30.375
This early?
Icarus: Or late.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.377
Both: Depending on
how you look at it.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.245
Both of you guys are crazy, man.
(laughter)

13:34.247 --> 13:36.181
Crazy, both of y'all,
still the same.
Let's roll, buddy.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.549
Come on, man.
Hey, count me in.

13:37.551 --> 13:38.883
I'm gonna go use the bathroom.

13:38.885 --> 13:39.984
All right, you know
where it's at?

13:39.986 --> 13:42.053
Come on--
do I know where it's at?

14:06.512 --> 14:08.513
Sifter:
<i>Look,</i>

14:08.515 --> 14:11.216
Determining the identity
of the hacker

14:11.218 --> 14:14.085
Who wrote the illegal firmware
update is a priority.

14:14.087 --> 14:17.322
But a recall of the product is

14:17.324 --> 14:19.390
Highly recommended, be...

14:19.392 --> 14:22.160
No, even if you send out
the new update,

14:22.162 --> 14:24.162
It can still be rewritten.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.630
All right,
that's up to you.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.332
Yeah.
(hangs up)

14:27.334 --> 14:29.934
Lawyers from p.E.
Skirting responsibility,

14:29.936 --> 14:33.638
Claiming user manipulation,
not a defect in their printer.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.306
Well, technically,
they're correct about that.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.875
You know, technically,

14:36.877 --> 14:38.209
It's still their product;
they've got to take

14:38.211 --> 14:39.377
Responsibility for fixing
the problem.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.279
What is it you want to show me?

14:41.281 --> 14:43.348
I compared the firmware upgrade

14:43.350 --> 14:45.550
<i>That elijah sent from the fire</i>
<i>in louisville with the one</i>

14:45.552 --> 14:48.953
The firmware that started
the fire in the printer--

14:48.955 --> 14:50.188
And they didn't match.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.556
It's not the
same code?

14:51.558 --> 14:52.590
No.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.292
Well, it is, it is.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.927
Just slightly altered.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.161
And that alteration
made it possible

14:57.163 --> 14:58.563
For me to track
the I.P. Address

14:58.565 --> 15:00.365
<i>Right to the person</i>
<i>who hacked the wi-fi</i>

15:00.367 --> 15:03.101
<i>And intruded the router,</i>
<i>taking control of the computer</i>

15:03.103 --> 15:05.403
<i>That communicated with the</i>
<i>printer that started the fire</i>

15:05.405 --> 15:07.238
<i>In stacie evers' condo.</i>

15:07.240 --> 15:08.673
Target's name is donald o'hare.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.942
All right, so that's
a good thing, right?

15:10.944 --> 15:13.011
We got our guy.
It's always the mistakes

15:13.013 --> 15:14.913
Our targets make
that get them caught.

15:16.282 --> 15:18.383
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

15:18.385 --> 15:21.219
Yeah, uh, something is
bothering you here.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.520
Our target used
a virtual private network

15:22.522 --> 15:25.990
And then put his own I.P.
Into the update?

15:25.992 --> 15:28.259
That's like robbing a bank
with a ski mask

15:28.261 --> 15:30.228
And then handing the teller
your driver's license

15:30.230 --> 15:31.429
To cash a check.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.563
Yeah, yeah.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.232
After going to all this trouble,

15:34.234 --> 15:36.067
Why embed the I.P.
In the update,

15:36.069 --> 15:38.303
Leading us right
to him? Yeah.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.371
Why, indeed?

15:54.520 --> 15:56.220
Man:
Over by the pump, steve.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.189
Get it out back.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.290
We're bringing it
to the...

15:59.292 --> 16:00.558
(door buzzes)

16:00.560 --> 16:01.626
Donald o'hare!

16:01.628 --> 16:03.494
Fbi! Freeze!

16:03.496 --> 16:05.530
Fbi! Get out of the way!

16:12.137 --> 16:13.471
(grunts)

16:13.473 --> 16:15.039
Donald o'hare!

16:15.041 --> 16:18.309
Stay right where you are.
You're under arrest.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.411
Give me your hands, come on.

16:22.581 --> 16:25.483
We found this on
your home computer.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.601
You know what
I'm thinking, donald?

16:43.603 --> 16:46.104
You're a pyromaniac
compelled to start fires

16:46.106 --> 16:47.705
For sexual gratification.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.707
But unlike other arsonists,

16:49.709 --> 16:52.043
You're too afraid
to do it in person.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.312
So you relied on
your computer skills

16:54.314 --> 16:55.680
To keep a safe distance.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.781
How am I doing?

16:56.783 --> 16:59.517
That video
doesn't prove a thing.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.053
But you still needed
an open wi-fi signal.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.755
And the right printer.

17:03.757 --> 17:06.557
So I'm guessing you started
driving around town,

17:06.559 --> 17:10.328
Sniffing for wi-fi signals
till you found one.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.597
And stacie lives, what,
six blocks from your place?

17:12.599 --> 17:15.566
You also needed
to see it happen,

17:15.568 --> 17:19.137
<i>So you installed a backdoor</i>
<i>trojan into stacie's computer</i>

17:19.139 --> 17:21.272
<i>In her bedroom so you could</i>
<i>access the camera,</i>

17:21.274 --> 17:24.542
<i>As well as the built-in camera</i>
<i>in the smart tv in the kitchen.</i>

17:24.544 --> 17:26.544
<i>But why did you mess with</i>
<i>the other devices?</i>

17:26.546 --> 17:30.515
What did the coffeemaker
do, other than scare her?

17:30.517 --> 17:32.150
Ah, you're remembering.

17:34.353 --> 17:36.454
Oh, it excited you to scare her.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.755
<i>It's your form of foreplay.</i>

17:37.757 --> 17:41.592
Well, here's what
I don't understand.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.594
Donald, maybe you can
help me with this.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.563
Did you want
to get caught?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.265
Did you want credit
for the exploit?

17:47.267 --> 17:49.267
I mean, why go to
all the trouble

17:49.269 --> 17:51.269
To stay anonymous
and distant

17:51.271 --> 17:54.405
If you were gonna embed your
I.P. Address in the update?

17:58.444 --> 18:01.479
Oh, you didn't know.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.815
Your I.P. Address
was embedded.

18:03.817 --> 18:06.651
Who gave you the code?

18:08.687 --> 18:10.188
I don't know who.

18:10.190 --> 18:14.525
Someone I met in a forum
on fire prevention.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.628
Do you remember
the user's handle?

18:18.597 --> 18:22.733
J-u-5-t-u-5.

18:22.735 --> 18:27.438
But... In leetspeak,

18:27.440 --> 18:28.673
Numbers are letters,

18:28.675 --> 18:29.674
So it really spells...

18:29.676 --> 18:31.576
"justice."

18:36.148 --> 18:37.748
According to p.E.,

18:37.750 --> 18:40.818
They've sold over
1.5 million of those printers.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.421
Unless we can
unplug them all, simon,

18:43.423 --> 18:45.456
Each one's a possible target.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.492
I'll let you know
what we find out.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.593
(knocking on glass)

18:48.595 --> 18:50.161
Hey. Heard you were back.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.429
Listen, we have a lead.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.663
We got to move quickly.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.565
There's a user
going by the handle justice.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.167
J-u-5-t-u-5.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.302
We think he may be
the author of the code.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.805
I need you to gain access
to the forums and...
Avery.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.306
(sighs)

19:02.308 --> 19:04.342
That's why I'm here.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.810
I know who wrote the code.

19:05.812 --> 19:06.844
(chuckles softly)

19:07.813 --> 19:09.747
I did.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.792
After I got busted for
the stock exchange hack,

19:21.794 --> 19:23.494
You guys took everything
away from me.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.330
You took my cell phone, my
video games, my computers,

19:26.332 --> 19:28.833
60,000 mp3s
on my laptop.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.835
But you didn't get this.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.670
Flash drive?

19:32.672 --> 19:34.605
Holds 128 gigs.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.240
Not enough for
all my music,

19:36.242 --> 19:38.843
But a safe place to back up
all my favorite codes.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.178
Like the printer exploit.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.180
Yeah.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.714
I called it ghost print.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.250
Code for basically hacking
into someone's network

19:46.252 --> 19:47.418
And taking control
of their printer.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.886
Look, I thought it
would be a funny prank

19:48.888 --> 19:50.254
To play on my friends.

19:50.256 --> 19:55.359
Took a while, but I figured out
how to do it on p.E. Printers.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.861
Why p.E.?
Well, because

19:56.863 --> 19:59.230
It's a popular brand and
just about everybody has one.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.832
Are you certain
this is your code?

20:01.834 --> 20:03.901
I compared it to what
we got from your c.I.,

20:03.903 --> 20:05.937
And it all lines up.

20:05.939 --> 20:08.639
But, look, j-just
the first part.

20:08.641 --> 20:09.907
Look, you got
to believe me.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.742
I only wrote code that
allowed the intrusion,

20:11.744 --> 20:13.578
Not the code
to set a fire.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.912
Sit down.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.481
Who else knew
about this code?

20:17.483 --> 20:18.716
See, that's the thing;
I don't know.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.717
Nelson.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.752
Okay.

20:21.754 --> 20:22.753
(sighs)

20:22.755 --> 20:24.355
I shared it on a few forums.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.723
But, look,
it was a long time ago.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.825
Look, anyone could've
taken my code

20:27.827 --> 20:29.427
A-and expanded on it.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.596
What's going on out there?

20:33.398 --> 20:34.765
Another fire.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.567
Community college
in atlanta.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.569
Local news is all over it.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.838
Security cam footage has
printers in the computer lab

20:40.840 --> 20:42.773
Mysteriously bursting
into flames.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.575
They're saying
it's a poltergeist.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.743
The guy we arrested
in louisville

20:45.745 --> 20:47.612
Is still behind bars.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.513
This is someone new.

20:57.689 --> 21:00.925
(sirens wailing in distance)

21:00.927 --> 21:03.327
I just talked
to the fire investigator.

21:03.329 --> 21:04.929
Emergency sprinkler system
was able to save the building,

21:04.931 --> 21:06.264
But not the lab.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.898
The fire burned too hot,
too fast.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.834
Found a janitor dead
in the storage closet.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.569
He wasn't able
to get out?
No.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.838
His only escape route would've
been right through the fire.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.906
<i>Autopsy report</i>
<i>shows third-degree burns...</i>
<i>Help me! Somebody!</i>

21:15.908 --> 21:17.375
<i>...Suggesting he tried</i>
<i>to get out, but probably</i>

21:17.377 --> 21:19.410
<i>Died of smoke inhalation</i>
<i>before he could.</i>

21:19.412 --> 21:21.612
They're not even sure if the
fire alarms were functioning.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.680
How many of these printers
are there?

21:22.682 --> 21:24.649
Four printers, four fires.

21:24.651 --> 21:25.883
All individual points of origin.

21:25.885 --> 21:26.851
One there,

21:26.853 --> 21:30.588
Two there, one over there.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.889
The behavior of our fire starter

21:31.891 --> 21:33.991
Doesn't match the profile
of an arsonist.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.927
Unlike donald o'hare, who
wanted to watch the blaze,

21:36.929 --> 21:39.730
This target doesn't seem
to share the same m.O.

21:39.732 --> 21:40.998
The first responders
didn't see

21:41.000 --> 21:43.567
Anyone at the scene,
these devices

21:43.569 --> 21:45.536
Don't have any
internal cameras,

21:45.538 --> 21:48.939
And the security cameras
are all hardwired.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.908
This is a hacker
playing with fire,

21:50.910 --> 21:52.877
Is this is.
This is some selfish,

21:52.879 --> 21:55.012
Inconsiderate bastard
who never stopped

21:55.014 --> 21:57.014
To think the consequences.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.416
Printers are fried.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.351
I seriously doubt
I can find a chip,

22:00.353 --> 22:02.753
Let alone recover
any data off one.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.990
You "seriously doubt"?

22:08.527 --> 22:10.594
You comfortable telling
his family that?

22:11.663 --> 22:12.997
Uh...
Ryan:
Elijah.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.837
If you need to go back
to washington, do so.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.839
I'm fine.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.541
Listen, I don't need
one of your therapy sessions.

22:23.543 --> 22:26.010
You're afraid. I understand.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.978
The idea of losing somebody
you care about...

22:27.980 --> 22:29.547
No, michelle is not
going anywhere.

22:29.549 --> 22:32.350
Maybe not. But devon is.

22:43.995 --> 22:46.897
So this office printer
wasn't on the same network

22:46.899 --> 22:49.066
As the other printers?

22:49.068 --> 22:50.067
Krumitz:
No, it was.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.403
Then why didn't it burn?

22:52.405 --> 22:54.004
Was it offline or unplugged?

22:54.006 --> 22:55.005
Nope.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.475
Just out of paper.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.076
<i>No fuel to start a fire.</i>

23:01.980 --> 23:04.882
I give you the match.

23:06.651 --> 23:07.785
A melted fuser.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.954
Proof there was
an intrusion.

23:09.956 --> 23:12.490
Check this out.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.558
(trilling)

23:18.830 --> 23:20.598
A new I.P. Address.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.900
Different than the last one
but embedded in the same spot.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.770
I can't figure how they managed
to make the same rookie mistake.

23:25.772 --> 23:28.706
Because it wasn't a mistake.

23:33.779 --> 23:35.579
(door opens, bell jingles)

23:37.549 --> 23:38.749
Can I help you?

23:38.751 --> 23:39.817
Ryan:
We sure hope so.

23:39.819 --> 23:43.521
How you started those fires
at the community college.

23:43.523 --> 23:46.924
Mundo: Your I.P. Address was
embedded in the firmware update.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.793
It's shocking, I know.

23:48.795 --> 23:49.860
(scoffs)

23:49.862 --> 23:51.662
What are you talking about?
I-I...

23:51.664 --> 23:54.532
We also know why
you started those fires.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.767
You were recently fired
as an I.T. Professor there.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.502
And now you work here.

23:58.504 --> 24:00.805
Oh. Y-you're looking for dave.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.573
I-I think
he might be in the back...

24:02.575 --> 24:04.575
Yeah, I wouldn't
try that, dave.

24:04.577 --> 24:08.012
If you do make it past us,
there's a swat team outside,

24:08.014 --> 24:09.613
And they will
shoot you on sight.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.515
Ryan: We also know
that you didn't write the code.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.984
You were a pawn
in someone else's game,

24:13.986 --> 24:15.886
And they set you up.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.522
So the only question left
for us to ask

24:18.524 --> 24:20.624
Is: Who gave you the code?

24:22.994 --> 24:24.695
Another one who's
not talking.

24:24.697 --> 24:25.930
(handcuffs clicking)

24:31.803 --> 24:34.104
â™ª

24:35.874 --> 24:37.808
(indistinct chatter)

24:49.254 --> 24:50.988
Heads up!

24:56.795 --> 24:59.263
After all these years,
you still can't hit

24:59.265 --> 25:01.599
A 360, huh?
(groans)

25:05.136 --> 25:07.204
Let's see you try it
in those shiny-ass shoes.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.639
(laughs)

25:08.641 --> 25:09.807
Man, I heard you got

25:09.809 --> 25:11.809
Three years probation,
no computer use.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.744
Yeah. Limited.
Damn.

25:13.746 --> 25:16.814
And I can use the computer
at the real estate office,

25:16.816 --> 25:18.582
But, uh, it's all
closely monitored.

25:18.584 --> 25:21.919
Aw, bro, that's worse than
the electric chair.
Yeah.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.555
According to my probie, I'm not
even allowed to associate myself

25:24.557 --> 25:25.723
With known hackers.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.725
Oh, well, uh, you
should bounce then,

25:27.727 --> 25:30.694
'cause meta is
worldwide, son! Ah!

25:30.696 --> 25:32.563
(laughs):
You're still the same, man.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.865
You know.
Hey, listen.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.901
Thanks for taking all the heat
on that stock exchange hack.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.869
You never gave me up,
and I won't forget that ever.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.938
And I won't forget
that you got me busted

25:40.940 --> 25:42.907
By sending all the money
to my bank account.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.208
Hey, we didn't know it'd
actually work, all right?

25:44.210 --> 25:46.210
Believe me, if we had
to do it over again...

25:46.212 --> 25:47.945
Look, man, it's all good,
all right? What's done is done.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.880
But check it, I need
a favor from you.
Name it.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.749
You still rolling hard
on the wire?

25:51.751 --> 25:53.083
All day, all night.
Cool.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.718
Well, look,
I'm looking for someone.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.087
Goes by the name of justice.
J-u-5-t-u-5.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.089
You know anything
about that?
No, it doesn't sound familiar.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.258
Of course, names kind of
all blend together.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.960
You know how many hackers
are using leetspeak now.

26:02.962 --> 26:04.161
Well, you're right
about that.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.663
What do you need from him?

26:05.665 --> 26:06.764
Just a work thing.

26:06.766 --> 26:07.998
At the real estate office?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.634
Yeah, man, he pissed
my boss off pretty bad.

26:10.636 --> 26:12.269
Look, just keep an eye out
on him for me.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.737
You can do that?
Yeah, man.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.139
If you see anything,
just let me know.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.675
You got my back,
I got yours, baby.
There it is, man.

26:17.677 --> 26:18.876
Speaking of backs,
stay off yours, all right?

26:18.878 --> 26:20.110
Oh, all right,
all right.

26:20.112 --> 26:21.645
Hey, get some new shoes,
all right?

26:21.647 --> 26:22.646
(laughs)

26:27.319 --> 26:29.920
Our arsonist in atlanta was
set up by the same deep web user

26:29.922 --> 26:31.655
Going by the handle justice.

26:31.657 --> 26:32.990
He wrote an executable

26:32.992 --> 26:35.192
Into the firmware update
that identified the sender.

26:35.194 --> 26:38.996
So what could he possibly gain
by revealing the user's code?

26:38.998 --> 26:40.130
Ownership.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.899
Credit as the author.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.901
Or maybe he just enjoys
creating chaos.

26:43.903 --> 26:46.170
Some hackers just want
to watch the world burn.

26:46.172 --> 26:49.006
How do we find this guy,
put a stop to all this?

26:49.008 --> 26:51.241
Well, the m.O.S
on all three cases are the same.

26:51.243 --> 26:52.910
He's handpicking
who to set up.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.645
First a black hat

26:54.647 --> 26:56.180
<i>Known for selling zero-days,</i>

26:56.182 --> 26:57.982
Then a deviant pyromaniac

26:57.984 --> 27:01.752
<i>Compelled to start fires,</i>
<i>and now a revenge arsonist</i>

27:01.754 --> 27:02.886
To make a public statement.

27:02.888 --> 27:04.355
Meanwhile, p.E.
Has done nothing

27:04.357 --> 27:06.957
To spread the word about
unplugging these printers.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.158
Can you believe there
were nine of them

27:08.160 --> 27:09.960
On the third floor
of this building?

27:09.962 --> 27:12.062
Yeah. I had them unplugged,
of course, but...

27:12.064 --> 27:14.999
I mean, one of the most
secure places in the country,

27:15.001 --> 27:16.967
And even we were
vulnerable.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.303
Sorry, but you two need
to see this.
More fires?

27:19.305 --> 27:21.739
Public electric just got
a video message from justice.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.207
It's untraceable.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.275
This is a freeze frame
of the first few seconds.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.345
Ryan:
"I'm just warming up."

27:38.323 --> 27:41.392
By now, all of you at p.E.,

27:41.394 --> 27:45.062
As well as the public,
have seen what I am capable of.

27:45.064 --> 27:49.767
A massive recall on your
printers will cost you millions,

27:49.769 --> 27:51.902
But the bad press
from additional fires

27:51.904 --> 27:54.104
Will cost you everything.

27:54.106 --> 27:57.975
Wire $10 million to the accounts
that I have provided you,

27:57.977 --> 27:59.810
And this all goes away.

27:59.812 --> 28:02.046
Ignore my request,

28:02.048 --> 28:04.248
And I'll post the codes online.

28:04.250 --> 28:08.052
Decide to recall
all of your printers,

28:08.054 --> 28:09.953
Be warned,

28:09.955 --> 28:12.289
It's not your only device
that can burn.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.258
You have two hours to comply

28:14.260 --> 28:18.462
Before p.E. Sets the world
on fire.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.433
That was his plan all along.

28:22.435 --> 28:23.967
In pathological terms,

28:23.969 --> 28:26.103
He's what's known
as a professional torch,

28:26.105 --> 28:28.005
Someone who burns
for profit.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.907
He needed those scapegoats
to get caught.

28:29.909 --> 28:32.443
Otherwise, the cause of the fire
would remain a mystery.

28:32.445 --> 28:34.078
Right. Proof of concept.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.479
Mundo: Which is
why he embedded

28:35.481 --> 28:37.915
The code that would reveal
their I.P. Addresses.

28:37.917 --> 28:41.985
Knowing that closet arsonists
and deviant hackers would see

28:41.987 --> 28:44.188
How easy it would
be to start a fire.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.323
Yeah, but it was all just
a setup by justice

28:46.325 --> 28:48.926
To prove that his exploits
were a viable threat,

28:48.928 --> 28:51.395
Something p.E. Would pay
$10 million to stop.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.864
Yeah, well, it worked.
P.E. Wants to pay.

28:53.866 --> 28:54.998
They can't do that.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.433
Uh, they can,

28:56.435 --> 28:59.002
And they most
likely will.

28:59.004 --> 29:02.506
Arson for profit
is a rational commercial act.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.943
If they don't pay,
there will be more fires.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.244
And if they do pay?

29:07.246 --> 29:09.146
Gives him incentive
to do it again.

29:15.954 --> 29:17.354
What's all this?

29:17.356 --> 29:20.290
Noticed you weren't around
for the video presentation.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.760
Yeah, I had a late lunch.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.228
Is, uh, this yours?

29:24.230 --> 29:26.830
Found it on
your desk.

29:26.832 --> 29:28.465
Yeah, thanks.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.000
Quest, huh?

29:30.002 --> 29:31.268
That's cool.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.471
It's kind of like
dorky dog tags.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.241
But if I had anything on
there I didn't want the fbi

29:37.243 --> 29:39.309
To know about, I'd
leave it at home.

29:41.179 --> 29:43.180
Ryan:
We have one hour

29:43.182 --> 29:45.249
To discover which
of these p.E. Devices

29:45.251 --> 29:47.818
Is capable of being hacked
to start a fire.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.987
Justice-- he's gonna target
something that's common,

29:49.989 --> 29:51.221
Something almost everybody has.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.023
Something that can't be stopped
by unplugging it

29:53.025 --> 29:55.259
Or pulling the paper
out of the tray.

29:55.261 --> 29:57.194
We need to stay one step
ahead of him this time.

29:57.196 --> 29:58.428
No more
playing catch-up.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.430
Make it burn.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.969
P.E. Just got five separate
offshore account numbers

30:05.971 --> 30:08.405
From justice-- singapore,
dubai, hong kong,

30:08.407 --> 30:09.940
Belize and the cayman islands.

30:09.942 --> 30:11.975
$2 million to each.
Well, it's smart.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.977
It's hard to monitor them all
with such a small window.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.313
You really think he's gonna
try this again if they pay?

30:16.315 --> 30:17.948
If we don't stop him,
who will?

30:17.950 --> 30:20.851
Uh, listen, avery,
about earlier.

30:20.853 --> 30:23.120
I'm... I-I was rattled.

30:23.122 --> 30:26.123
Elijah, a little piece
of advice:

30:26.125 --> 30:27.958
When it comes
to family,

30:27.960 --> 30:29.259
Be selfish.

30:37.035 --> 30:39.369
â™ª

30:54.619 --> 30:56.887
â™ª

31:06.331 --> 31:08.065
Krummy?

31:08.067 --> 31:09.566
(whoops)

31:09.568 --> 31:10.868
Check it out.

31:14.339 --> 31:16.340
I did it.

31:16.342 --> 31:18.141
<i>I remembered something I read</i>

31:18.143 --> 31:19.943
A few years back, right?
It was this article

31:19.945 --> 31:21.411
About how you can blow up a
laptop's battery on command.

31:21.413 --> 31:22.913
So I started
with that first.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.248
Krumitz:
I came pretty close

31:24.250 --> 31:27.951
But the battery's
a much more viable option.

31:27.953 --> 31:29.086
Yeah, well,
that's because laptop batteries

31:29.088 --> 31:30.187
Are smarter than you think.

31:30.189 --> 31:33.190
That monitors the power
level of the unit,

31:33.192 --> 31:35.025
Allowing the operating system
to check the battery's charge

31:35.027 --> 31:39.363
That means lithium ion batteries
can regulate their own heat

31:39.365 --> 31:40.564
For safety purposes.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.032
Ryan:
Or be manipulated

31:42.034 --> 31:43.333
To overheat and explode.

31:46.437 --> 31:48.105
I had written pieces
of the code for it already.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.040
It was an old exploit I
was working on back...

31:51.443 --> 31:56.280
I'm gonna call p.E. And let them
know about this new exploit.

31:56.282 --> 31:58.649
We need to know
what we're up against,

31:58.651 --> 32:00.250
In case he walks away
with the money.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.585
Wait, in case he...

32:01.587 --> 32:03.120
You mean they paid?

32:03.122 --> 32:04.288
Ten minutes ago.

32:04.290 --> 32:07.691
And us tracking where that money
goes, we're gonna show him

32:07.693 --> 32:10.594
The real meaning
of the word "justice."

32:22.941 --> 32:25.242
What have we got?
Just monitoring
all the accounts.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.678
As soon as justice moves
one cent, we'll know about it.

32:27.680 --> 32:30.514
Good. He's gonna want a reward
for all this hard work.

32:30.516 --> 32:33.450
And he'll do it sooner
rather than later.

32:36.688 --> 32:38.155
Nelson!

32:43.728 --> 32:45.595
Nelson just left.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.965
I tried calling his cell phone.
He's not answering.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.099
Do you know where he went?

32:49.101 --> 32:50.367
He didn't say.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.402
After he showed me
how to burn the computer,

32:52.404 --> 32:54.004
What did he do
when I left?

32:54.006 --> 32:56.173
He went back to work
on his computer.

32:56.175 --> 32:58.108
Can you disable
the keystroke loggers on these?

32:58.110 --> 33:00.344
No. We'll be able to see

33:00.346 --> 33:02.412
Whatever he typed last.

33:06.384 --> 33:08.318
What is it? What did he type?

33:08.320 --> 33:09.353
A message to justice.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.021
"don't touch the money.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.189
"the feds are onto you.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.357
"I still got your back.

33:13.359 --> 33:15.258
Meet me at our spot
in an hour."

33:29.173 --> 33:30.574
(indistinct chatter)

33:32.744 --> 33:34.378
Fbi! Show me your hands!

33:34.380 --> 33:36.079
Stand up slowly!

33:36.081 --> 33:38.181
Freeze! Don't move!
Right hand only.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.350
Remove your headsets.
Let them drop.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.419
Put your hands back up.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.388
(singsongy):
Dude, we're being swatted!

33:44.390 --> 33:45.589
We didn't...
We didn't do anything.

33:45.591 --> 33:46.423
Man:
Clear!

33:46.425 --> 33:48.492
He's not here!

33:48.494 --> 33:50.727
Turn around. Down.
Hey.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.195
Stay down.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.598
(handcuffs clicking)

33:56.768 --> 33:58.402
Where is he?

33:58.404 --> 34:00.704
Where is justice?

34:12.250 --> 34:14.284
You're late.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.319
Had to make sure
you came alone.

34:16.321 --> 34:18.722
No feds hiding
in the bushes.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.424
So, uh, you're
behind all this, huh?

34:20.426 --> 34:23.493
Man, I almost told you
earlier, all right?

34:23.495 --> 34:25.295
You kind of
caught me off guard.

34:25.297 --> 34:26.663
Your probation officer
got you looking

34:26.665 --> 34:28.265
Into his cases
or something?

34:28.267 --> 34:32.235
I know a piece of my code was
being used on the printers.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.371
I mean, anybody could
have had it over the wire.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.273
Wasn't until you mentioned
another device that can burn.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.442
That's when
I remembered.
The laptop.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.677
You found the article
about blowing up the battery.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.779
We started
that project together.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.247
I finished it.

34:44.249 --> 34:48.351
Trying to make a few bucks
selling exploits, that was it.

34:48.353 --> 34:51.121
Yeah, and we made
ten million, son!

34:51.123 --> 34:53.123
Okay, so what now?

34:53.125 --> 34:54.858
You're gonna wire all the
money to your bank account?

34:54.860 --> 34:56.226
What, you think
they won't notice?

34:56.228 --> 34:57.294
You think this
is a game.

34:57.296 --> 34:58.695
Listen, man,
they will find you.

34:58.697 --> 34:59.729
I know these people.

34:59.731 --> 35:01.431
They won't stop
until they do.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.333
Someone got hurt.
Someone died...

35:03.335 --> 35:06.336
Hey! I didn't start
those fires, all right?

35:06.338 --> 35:08.238
I just pointed out
a major security flaw,

35:08.240 --> 35:10.440
And then handed them
the bad guy using it.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.142
You don't get
it, do you?

35:12.144 --> 35:15.579
Good guys don't do it for
the money or the credit.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.514
They do it to protect
innocent people.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.549
Elijah's tracking
nelson's tesla

35:19.551 --> 35:20.817
Since we couldn't
locate his phone.

35:24.822 --> 35:26.389
Neither one of
them's online.

35:26.391 --> 35:28.391
He disabled them both.

35:28.393 --> 35:30.861
Any luck figuring out
where he sent that message to?

35:30.863 --> 35:33.396
Yeah, it was a text from his
computer to a registered number.

35:33.398 --> 35:34.898
Which is weird,
since nelson knows

35:34.900 --> 35:37.234
We log everything
on fbi-issued computers.

35:37.236 --> 35:38.869
Why not send the text
from his phone?

35:38.871 --> 35:40.804
Because he didn't want
to hide it.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.340
He just wanted
to get a head start.

35:43.342 --> 35:46.276
So, what, feds brainwashed you?

35:46.278 --> 35:47.344
You working for them now?

35:47.346 --> 35:49.246
It's like you said.

35:49.248 --> 35:51.348
You didn't
start the fires.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.250
Now, look,
if you just

35:53.252 --> 35:55.185
Turn yourself in and
give back the money,

35:55.187 --> 35:57.420
They might go
easy on you, okay?
(scoffs)
all right.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.823
And what, cut me
a deal like yours?

35:59.825 --> 36:01.324
Chained to a desk,

36:01.326 --> 36:03.894
Chasing down some other hackers
for minimum wage?

36:03.896 --> 36:05.795
Yeah. No thanks.
I'll take my chances.

36:05.797 --> 36:08.265
I got a guy in the deep web

36:08.267 --> 36:10.300
Willing to launder the money,
ten cents on the dollar.

36:10.302 --> 36:12.669
They will still find you.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.438
So, what? That mean
you don't want your cut?

36:15.440 --> 36:17.340
Huh?

36:17.342 --> 36:19.409
Two million dollars
in belize.

36:24.282 --> 36:26.316
You sure about this?

36:26.318 --> 36:29.686
You got my back,
I got yours.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.821
Okay, I know it looks bad,
but he left a digital trail

36:31.823 --> 36:33.456
For us to follow for a reason.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.959
Or he's playing us, and he's
gonna disappear just like...

36:35.961 --> 36:38.528
Like tobin?

36:38.530 --> 36:41.364
Black hats are hardwired
to buck the system.

36:41.366 --> 36:42.532
Most can't be reformed.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.434
What do you want me
to say, elijah?

36:44.436 --> 36:45.969
I was wrong about tobin.

36:45.971 --> 36:47.771
I will be
wrong again.

36:47.773 --> 36:51.374
But I am not wrong about nelson.

36:51.376 --> 36:54.411
I want you to be right, okay?
I really do.

36:54.413 --> 36:57.380
But tobin was another hacker
we all trusted who betrayed us.

36:57.382 --> 37:01.618
I'm just saying, we have to be
open to that possibility.

37:01.620 --> 37:04.888
Not everybody gets a second
chance to do what's right, bro.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.723
It's not too late, man.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.392
Just think about what
you're doing here, okay?

37:09.394 --> 37:10.427
Give it up already,
all right?!

37:10.429 --> 37:12.395
I'm not down
with this whole

37:12.397 --> 37:14.431
White hat hacker vibe
you got going!

37:14.433 --> 37:15.765
Right, well you
know what? Take it.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.500
I can't take the money.

37:17.502 --> 37:19.869
And I can't have your
back no more neither.

37:19.871 --> 37:22.606
I'm sorry it had to
go down like this, man.

37:24.809 --> 37:26.476
What the hell, man?!

37:26.478 --> 37:29.312
Something told me I was
right to be nervous.

37:29.314 --> 37:32.515
Your hacker rep is ruined.

37:32.517 --> 37:34.517
You're done.
I will make sure

37:34.519 --> 37:35.752
Everyone knows
you're working with the feds.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.454
Yeah? Yeah, yeah,
well, good.

37:37.456 --> 37:39.689
Because I got a new rep to
protect, one that I'm proud of.

37:39.691 --> 37:42.359
Yeah?
Yeah.

37:42.361 --> 37:43.426
Come here!

37:43.428 --> 37:45.729
Come here!

37:45.731 --> 37:47.030
Hey!

37:49.800 --> 37:51.534
Come here! Come here!

37:51.536 --> 37:53.603
(both grunting)

37:56.607 --> 37:58.575
(yells)

38:09.287 --> 38:10.620
(panting)

38:10.622 --> 38:11.888
(phone beeps)

38:11.890 --> 38:13.623
(beeping)

38:13.625 --> 38:15.392
We got a signal.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.793
His phone's back
in the network.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.461
He wants us to find him.

38:18.463 --> 38:19.663
Let's go!

38:19.665 --> 38:21.331
(officers shouting,
engines starting)

38:27.438 --> 38:29.506
(sirens wailing,
tires screeching)

38:31.442 --> 38:34.611
Fbi! Hands where
I can see them!

38:34.613 --> 38:36.046
Hands up! Get your hands up!

38:36.048 --> 38:37.781
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait. Listen!

38:37.783 --> 38:38.815
Down to the ground!
Hey, look, look!

38:38.817 --> 38:39.949
Stay down! Stay down!

38:39.951 --> 38:41.484
(indistinct shouting)

38:41.486 --> 38:42.485
Stop! He's with us!

38:42.487 --> 38:44.754
You are with us,
aren't you?

38:45.656 --> 38:47.057
Spread out!
Clear the area!

38:47.059 --> 38:50.460
Yeah. He was my friend.

38:50.462 --> 38:51.928
I just had to
know for sure.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.763
I wanted to give him another
chance, like you gave me,

38:53.765 --> 38:55.765
But... He didn't want it.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.600
Mundo:
Where is he now?

38:57.602 --> 38:59.469
Tell me you didn't
let him get away.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.338
No, I didn't let him get away.

39:01.340 --> 39:03.807
I knew if things got heated,
he'd want my old exploits,

39:03.809 --> 39:06.476
So I put a tracking chip
on my flash drive.

39:06.478 --> 39:09.879
We're gonna show him the real
meaning of the word "justice."

39:27.465 --> 39:30.767
â™ª

39:44.949 --> 39:47.617
Look, when he gets
a closer look,

39:47.619 --> 39:48.885
He'll figure it out,
he'll kill the signal.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.487
We'll get there before he does.

39:50.489 --> 39:52.622
All right, we're on the move!

39:52.624 --> 39:53.890
Suspect is stationary

39:53.892 --> 39:55.058
At 83rd near
gardengrove!

39:55.060 --> 39:56.593
Look, I get it

39:56.595 --> 39:58.027
If you don't
want me around anymore.

39:58.029 --> 39:59.796
Can you do me a favor?

39:59.798 --> 40:01.731
Can you tell the judge
who set us up

40:01.733 --> 40:03.032
That I helped
solve the case?

40:03.034 --> 40:05.034
Look, avery,
I'm a cyber-snitch now.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.736
I can't go to jail.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.071
Nelson,

40:08.073 --> 40:10.106
You're not a snitch.

40:10.108 --> 40:12.542
You work for the fbi.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.043
We are a team.

40:14.045 --> 40:16.513
But we all need to know
what play is being called.

40:16.515 --> 40:18.581
Okay?

40:20.651 --> 40:21.718
Okay?

40:23.521 --> 40:26.122
Okay.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.691
Let's go get this guy.

40:32.730 --> 40:34.798
â™ª

41:00.124 --> 41:02.192
â™ª

41:21.011 --> 41:22.912
Vanilla chai latte,

41:22.914 --> 41:24.914
Extra vanilla.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.983
Thank you.

41:28.919 --> 41:31.855
I really appreciate
you coming, devon.

41:31.857 --> 41:34.691
Look, elijah,

41:34.693 --> 41:37.494
I get...

41:37.496 --> 41:39.195
That this is not ideal.

41:39.197 --> 41:41.598
I want us to
start over again.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.866
What?

41:42.868 --> 41:44.501
You and me.

41:44.503 --> 41:46.769
I want to try again.

41:47.805 --> 41:49.739
Don't say something
you don't mean.

41:49.741 --> 41:51.508
I do mean it.

41:51.510 --> 41:53.776
And I know it's selfish,
and I-I know it's sudden,

41:53.778 --> 41:55.612
But I realized
I don't want michelle to go.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.747
Elijah, don't...
I don't want <i>you</i> to go.

41:59.717 --> 42:03.686
I want us to
be us again.

42:03.688 --> 42:05.622
But better.
I want to be better.

42:05.624 --> 42:07.690
I don't...

42:09.660 --> 42:10.660
Devon,

42:10.662 --> 42:13.663
Please...

42:13.665 --> 42:16.666
Don't go.

42:16.668 --> 42:18.735
