ANNOUNCER:
<i>In the last episode of</i> Soap,

00:04.571 --> 00:06.071
<i>real Burt thought</i>
<i>his troubles were over</i>

00:06.072 --> 00:08.574
<i>when he was beamed to Earth</i>
<i>and called Mary to meet him.</i>

00:08.575 --> 00:10.576
<i>Only his troubles weren't over,</i>
<i>because on the way,</i>

00:10.577 --> 00:13.078
<i>Mary saw the alien Burt</i>
<i>and got very troubled.</i>

00:13.079 --> 00:15.080
<i>Jessica told Chester</i>
<i>he was in trouble</i>

00:15.081 --> 00:16.582
<i>because she thought</i>
<i>he was having an affair.</i>

00:16.583 --> 00:18.584
<i>Only Chester said</i>
<i>she shouldn't be troubled</i>

00:18.585 --> 00:20.085
<i>because he isn't.</i>

00:20.086 --> 00:21.587
<i>Eunice, who's having trouble</i>
<i>being around Dutch,</i>

00:21.588 --> 00:23.088
<i>and Corinne</i>
<i>saw Chester with another woman,</i>

00:23.089 --> 00:25.090
<i>which troubled them both,</i>

00:25.091 --> 00:27.092
<i>and might get Chester</i>
<i>in a lot of trouble.</i>

00:27.093 --> 00:29.094
<i>Billy and his teacher</i>
<i>are having trouble being alone.</i>

00:29.095 --> 00:30.095
<i>When on their date,</i>

00:30.096 --> 00:31.597
<i>they saw Eunice and another man.</i>

00:31.598 --> 00:33.599
<i>Chester, with a woman,</i>

00:33.600 --> 00:35.100
<i>saw them and left</i>
<i>before they saw him,</i>

00:35.101 --> 00:36.602
<i>and he got into trouble,</i>

00:36.603 --> 00:38.604
<i>and Corinne and Tim</i>
<i>won't be having trouble anymore</i>

00:38.605 --> 00:40.606
<i>because Tim has left.</i>

00:40.607 --> 00:42.107
<i>Troubled?</i>

00:42.108 --> 00:45.111
<i>You won't be</i>
<i>after this episode of</i> Soap.

00:49.115 --> 00:51.617
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of two sisters,</i>

00:51.618 --> 00:53.619
<i>Jessica Tate...</i>

00:53.620 --> 00:56.121

01:32.659 --> 01:35.661
Jessica,
is this party really necessary?

01:35.662 --> 01:39.665
Well, Chester,
of course it is, darling.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.667
Dutch has joined our family.

01:41.668 --> 01:42.668
This party is for him.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.671
Couldn't we just
send him a card?

01:46.673 --> 01:48.173
And why do we always

01:48.174 --> 01:49.675
have to invite the Campbells?

01:49.676 --> 01:51.176
Don't we know anyone else?

01:51.177 --> 01:54.179
Well, we don't always
invite the Campbells.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.182
Sometimes, we don't invite
anyone at all.

01:58.184 --> 01:59.685
Of course, on those occasions,

01:59.686 --> 02:01.186
we don't have a party...

02:01.187 --> 02:05.691
which is probably why
no one ever shows up.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.693
You sure I look all right?

02:08.695 --> 02:11.196
Oh, you look wonderful,
darling, really.

02:11.197 --> 02:12.197
Yeah, they're gonna hate me.

02:12.198 --> 02:13.699
Oh, they're not gonna hate you.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.200
Whose is that?
What?

02:15.201 --> 02:16.702
That's my tie.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.203
You stole my tie.

02:18.204 --> 02:21.206
Jess, he stole my tie.

02:21.207 --> 02:23.208
Daddy, I lent him
one of your ties.

02:23.209 --> 02:25.210
That is my favorite tie.

02:25.211 --> 02:26.712
JESSICA:
Well, darling,

02:26.713 --> 02:28.714
you said that this
was your favorite tie.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.215
They're both my favorite.

02:30.216 --> 02:32.217
Here, you can take it back.

02:32.218 --> 02:34.219
It don't go
with these pants anyway.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.721
Oh, wonderful.

02:35.722 --> 02:40.225
In the body of a gorilla
lives Pierre Cardin.

02:40.226 --> 02:42.227
Eunice, I don't believe it.

02:42.228 --> 02:43.729
All those lessons,

02:43.730 --> 02:45.731
ballet, piano, elocution,
charm school, and for what?

02:45.732 --> 02:47.232
Oh, Daddy.

02:47.233 --> 02:51.236
The braces, the fat farm,
the hump, the nose job.

02:51.237 --> 02:53.238
Daddy, come on.

02:53.239 --> 02:56.241
You're a very attractive
woman, Eunice...

02:56.242 --> 02:57.242
Well, thank you.

02:57.243 --> 03:00.245
But it wasn't cheap.

03:01.247 --> 03:02.247
Uh-oh.

03:02.248 --> 03:04.249
Uh-oh,
they're here.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.250
They're here.

03:05.251 --> 03:06.252
Chester, look glad.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.755
Hello, darling.
Come in.

03:09.756 --> 03:11.256
Hello, Jess.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.258
Hi, Chester.
Mary.

03:14.260 --> 03:16.261
MARY: Hello.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.263
Chester.

03:18.264 --> 03:20.265
Stockbroker, charged
with embezzlement,

03:20.266 --> 03:21.767
murdered my son.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.269
Good to see you, Chet.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.272
Hello, Burt.

03:27.273 --> 03:28.774
Oh, my goodness.

03:28.775 --> 03:31.277
Oh, wow, are you the hot one?

03:33.780 --> 03:35.280
This is Millie.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.282
This is my sister, Jessica...
Hello.

03:37.283 --> 03:38.283
And that's her husband, Chester.

03:38.284 --> 03:39.284
How do you do?

03:39.285 --> 03:40.285
This is a palace.

03:40.286 --> 03:42.788
I'm in a regular damn palace.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.289
Are we in England?

03:44.290 --> 03:45.791
Come on, Millie.

03:45.792 --> 03:50.796
Well, I see Einstein
found Madame Curie.

03:50.797 --> 03:51.797
I'm so glad

03:51.798 --> 03:53.799
I decided to throw this party.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.300
Otherwise,
there wouldn't be any food

03:55.301 --> 03:56.802
when you got here.

03:56.803 --> 03:59.304
Hors d'oeuvres, Mary?

03:59.305 --> 04:01.306
Oh, Jess, I'm so confused.

04:01.307 --> 04:02.307
No, it's simple.

04:02.308 --> 04:03.809
If they're pink, they're salmon.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.311
If they're black,
they're caviar.

04:07.313 --> 04:09.315
No, I mean about Burt.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.320
What do you mean?

04:15.321 --> 04:18.824
He is trying
to drive me crazy...

04:18.825 --> 04:20.325
but I can't figure out why.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.327
At first, I thought
it was for my money,

04:22.328 --> 04:25.831
but then I realized,
I have no money.

04:25.832 --> 04:28.834
Then it's not for your money.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.836
I swear, Jess,

04:30.837 --> 04:33.338
he's doing what they do
in those Hitchcock movies.

04:33.339 --> 04:35.841
He's trying to make me
think I'm crazy.

04:36.843 --> 04:39.845
I hate Hitchcock.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.346
I saw <i>Psycho,</i>

04:41.347 --> 04:45.350
and I haven't been able
to take a shower since.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.352
Why do you think
he's doing it, Jess?

04:47.353 --> 04:48.854
For the money.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.355
They all do it for the money.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.857
There's no money.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.859
Oh, of course there is.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.360
Horror movies

04:55.361 --> 04:57.362
have grossed over $400 million

04:57.363 --> 04:58.864
this summer.

04:58.865 --> 05:01.366
See, I read that in <i>TIME.</i>

05:01.367 --> 05:03.368
They all do it
for the money, Mary,

05:03.369 --> 05:06.372
and Hitchcock is no different.

05:09.876 --> 05:12.378
Are you the hot one?

05:16.883 --> 05:19.385
Hi, doll, you wanna get naked?

05:22.889 --> 05:23.889
What...? What the...?

05:23.890 --> 05:24.890
Where is Chuck?

05:24.891 --> 05:25.891
What do you got in mind?

05:27.393 --> 05:29.394
Excuse me, but I think
I see someone I know.

05:29.395 --> 05:30.395
Yeah, yeah.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.898
Knock yourself out.

05:32.899 --> 05:35.400
Hey, Chuck, did you find it yet?

05:35.401 --> 05:37.903
Uh, no.
Well, great.

05:37.904 --> 05:40.405
How am I gonna see
without one contact lens? I don't know.

05:40.406 --> 05:43.909
What are you doing?

05:43.910 --> 05:44.910
What do you mean?

05:44.911 --> 05:46.411
Use a glass, you idiot.

05:46.412 --> 05:47.412
Oh.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.920
Oh, that's much better.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.422
Thanks.

05:58.424 --> 06:00.425
Hi.

06:00.426 --> 06:01.927
Hi.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.428
You seem to be
sitting there so quiet.

06:03.429 --> 06:04.429
Is something the matter?

06:04.430 --> 06:06.932
See, my husband was a priest,

06:06.933 --> 06:08.433
and he left the church for me,

06:08.434 --> 06:09.434
which made him so guilty

06:09.435 --> 06:11.436
that he went to live in a cave,

06:11.437 --> 06:12.437
but then our son
was born possessed,

06:12.438 --> 06:14.439
and he came back
to perform the exorcism,

06:14.440 --> 06:15.440
and when it was over,

06:15.441 --> 06:16.441
I thought
it would change things,

06:16.442 --> 06:17.943
but no, he wouldn't go near me.

06:17.944 --> 06:19.945
He wouldn't touch me,
and the other day, he left me.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.448
I'm Corinne.

06:25.451 --> 06:26.451
Millie.

06:26.452 --> 06:27.953
Nice meeting you.

06:29.455 --> 06:30.456
Hey, sweetie.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.460
Chet.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.963
Which one's the hot one?

06:37.964 --> 06:39.965
I beg your pardon.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.466
Come on, which one
of these tootsies here

06:41.467 --> 06:42.968
is the hot one?

06:42.969 --> 06:44.970
How dare you?

06:44.971 --> 06:45.971
Whoa.

06:56.983 --> 06:59.484
That's enough, men.

06:59.485 --> 07:00.986
Your leave is canceled.

07:00.987 --> 07:04.490
Back to the barracks.

07:08.494 --> 07:10.996
Fifi?

07:10.997 --> 07:13.999
Fifi, what are you doing here?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.500
I'm sorry, but...

07:15.501 --> 07:17.502
Fifi, I told you it had to end,

07:17.503 --> 07:20.505
that it was only
a wartime thing.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.007
You have a husband at the front.

07:22.008 --> 07:23.508
I have a wife back home.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.010
It was short,

07:25.011 --> 07:26.011
it was beautiful,

07:26.012 --> 07:27.512
and I shall treasure
the moments always,

07:27.513 --> 07:30.515
but it's over, Fifi.

07:30.516 --> 07:33.018
Remember me
as I will remember you,

07:33.019 --> 07:35.020
and let us say farewell.

07:35.021 --> 07:37.523
You will live
in my heart forever...

07:39.525 --> 07:41.026
And you'd better see a doctor.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.529
You gave me
some funny foreign thing.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.034
Danny.

07:49.035 --> 07:50.535
Yeah, Millie.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.537
Danny, remember when you said

07:52.538 --> 07:53.538
you had to think
about marrying me?

07:53.539 --> 07:56.041
I haven't had a chance yet, Mil.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.542
Well, don't think
about it, Danny.

07:57.543 --> 07:58.543
No, I have to, Millie.

07:58.544 --> 08:00.045
No, I don't wanna marry you.

08:00.046 --> 08:01.046
You don't?

08:01.047 --> 08:02.047
No.

08:02.048 --> 08:04.049
Oh, gee, Mil.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.051
I'm sorry, Danny.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.552
Really, I am.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.054
I like you, and you're terrific,

08:09.055 --> 08:10.555
and you have one hell of a body,

08:10.556 --> 08:12.057
but your entire family is crazy,

08:12.058 --> 08:13.558
and in just a matter of time,

08:13.559 --> 08:15.060
you're gonna be crazy too,

08:15.061 --> 08:17.562
and once you're crazy,
I'll probably go crazy,

08:17.563 --> 08:18.563
and I don't wanna go crazy.

08:18.564 --> 08:19.564
They finally found

08:19.565 --> 08:20.565
the right color for my hair,

08:20.566 --> 08:22.067
so I don't wanna go crazy.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.068
But you saved my life.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.070
Oh, it's all right. Any time.

08:25.071 --> 08:26.571
Well, what are you gonna do?

08:26.572 --> 08:29.074
Oh, I'll probably become
a manicurist.

08:29.075 --> 08:30.575
I've got a flair for it.

08:30.576 --> 08:32.577
Well, goodbye, Danny,
and thank you.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.080
Yeah, bye.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.082
Hey, Ma.

08:38.083 --> 08:41.087
Ma, do you think
our family's crazy?

08:54.600 --> 08:55.600
Crazy?

08:55.601 --> 08:58.103
Crazy?

09:03.609 --> 09:04.610
Ma?

09:07.113 --> 09:08.113
Aunt Jessie.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.114
Yes, what?

09:09.115 --> 09:11.116
Do you think our family's crazy?

09:11.117 --> 09:14.119
Hit the dirt, everybody.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.122
It's a grenade!

09:24.630 --> 09:26.631
Major, look what you've done.

09:31.637 --> 09:32.637
Oh, it's the gas main.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.139
They're working down the street.
It blew up.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.141
Oh, thank goodness.

09:36.142 --> 09:38.643
I thought it was the pineapple.

09:39.645 --> 09:42.147
Danny, what was your question?

09:42.148 --> 09:44.650
Never mind.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.160
Come on in.

09:55.661 --> 09:56.661
So...

09:56.662 --> 09:58.163
So.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.664
This is where I live.

09:59.665 --> 10:00.665
Very nice.

10:00.666 --> 10:01.666
Thank you.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.168
Very, very nice.
Thanks.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.669
You've done some
nice things with it.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.671
Thanks. Hungry?

10:06.672 --> 10:07.672
No. You?

10:07.673 --> 10:08.674
No.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.177
Why don't we sit down.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.179
Sure.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.685
So...

10:20.686 --> 10:23.188
So...

10:25.691 --> 10:27.692
Have you lived here long?

10:27.693 --> 10:30.195
No, just since my divorce.

10:30.196 --> 10:32.697
Could I take a shower?

10:32.698 --> 10:33.698
What's wrong?

10:33.699 --> 10:34.699
Nothing. Nothing.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.202
I just...

10:38.204 --> 10:40.705
Look at this. I've been
here five minutes,

10:40.706 --> 10:42.207
and your place looks like
<i>The Poseidon Adventure.</i>

10:42.208 --> 10:44.209
Come on, Billy, relax.

10:44.210 --> 10:45.210
I'm relaxed.

10:45.211 --> 10:49.214
I'm just tense.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.215
What's wrong?

10:50.216 --> 10:53.218
You see...
I've never been

10:53.219 --> 10:55.220
with a divorced woman before.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.721
It feels very strange.

10:56.722 --> 10:59.224
If this were a school night,
I'd be home two hours ago.

10:59.225 --> 11:02.227
Billy, I didn't invite you
up here to seduce you.

11:02.228 --> 11:03.228
You didn't?

11:03.229 --> 11:06.731
Whatever happens
in our relationship happens,

11:06.732 --> 11:08.233
and if something does happen,

11:08.234 --> 11:10.735
it'll be a natural
and easy thing to deal with,

11:10.736 --> 11:12.738
so let's just take it
one step at a time, okay?

11:18.244 --> 11:20.245
Are you expecting company?

11:20.246 --> 11:21.246
No.

11:21.247 --> 11:22.748
Excuse me.

11:26.252 --> 11:27.252
Charlie.
Hi there.

11:27.253 --> 11:30.255
Charlie, get out.
I'm not even in.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.257
Go away.
Hey, this is cute.

11:32.258 --> 11:33.758
Place looks nice.

11:33.759 --> 11:34.759
Charlie, what are you
doing here?

11:34.760 --> 11:35.760
I was in the neighborhood.

11:35.761 --> 11:36.761
I though I'd drop by.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.263
Hi, kid.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.266
I didn't realize

11:41.267 --> 11:42.267
you tutored on Saturday nights.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.268
Uh, she's not exactly...

11:43.269 --> 11:44.769
Charlie, we're a little busy.

11:44.770 --> 11:45.770
Who are you?

11:45.771 --> 11:46.771
Who are you?

11:46.772 --> 11:48.773
Um, Charlie, this is Bill Tate.

11:48.774 --> 11:49.774
Bill, this is Charlie Walker.

11:49.775 --> 11:50.775
Your brother.

11:50.776 --> 11:51.776
Her husband.

11:51.777 --> 11:53.278
Ex-husband.

11:53.279 --> 11:54.279
So, what's the kid doing here,

11:54.280 --> 11:56.281
delivering pizza?

11:56.282 --> 11:57.782
Collecting for
a paper route, what?

11:57.783 --> 11:59.284
Leslie and I

11:59.285 --> 12:01.287
are spending
an evening together.

12:03.789 --> 12:06.291
You're kidding.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.292
This is a joke, no?

12:07.293 --> 12:08.793
No, it's no joke.

12:08.794 --> 12:11.296
Oh, terrific...

12:11.297 --> 12:13.298
And I was too immature for you.

12:13.299 --> 12:16.301
That's great.

12:16.302 --> 12:17.302
I walk in here

12:17.303 --> 12:20.305
expecting to find David Niven
mixing martinis,

12:20.306 --> 12:21.307
instead, it's Sabu.

12:23.309 --> 12:25.310
Great. Nice move, Leslie.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.311
Mr. Walker, I don't...

12:26.312 --> 12:28.813
Kid, run along, huh?

12:28.814 --> 12:30.815
I've got some business
to discuss with Mrs. Walker.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.317
He's not leaving, Charlie.
You are.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.319
Leslie, please,
I'll handle this.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.320
I'm not leaving, Charlie.

12:35.321 --> 12:36.321
You are.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.823
Look, sonny,
either you take a walk,

12:38.824 --> 12:40.825
or I bounce you down the stairs.

12:40.826 --> 12:42.327
Leslie, you look...

12:42.328 --> 12:44.329
I'm only gonna say this once,

12:44.330 --> 12:45.830
so you better pay attention.

12:45.831 --> 12:46.831
You've been asked to leave,

12:46.832 --> 12:48.333
and you've been asked nicely.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.335
Leslie has asked you,
and now I'm telling you.

12:50.336 --> 12:51.836
I'm a fourth-degree
black belt in karate,

12:51.837 --> 12:53.838
and a third-degree
master in Tai Chi.

12:53.839 --> 12:55.340
If you choose to stay
and make trouble,

12:55.341 --> 12:57.843
I'm going to hurt you
very, very badly.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.346
So, what's it gonna be?

13:02.348 --> 13:05.350
I just dropped by to say hello.

13:05.351 --> 13:06.351
And?

13:06.352 --> 13:07.352
And I said it.

13:12.358 --> 13:14.859
God, look at the time.

13:14.860 --> 13:18.863
Uh, I got to be going.

13:18.864 --> 13:22.367
It was nice seeing you both.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.370
Bye.

13:27.873 --> 13:30.375
That was wonderful.

13:30.376 --> 13:31.376
He bought it.

13:31.377 --> 13:32.877
Such calm, cool.

13:32.878 --> 13:34.879
He actually bought it.

13:34.880 --> 13:39.384
Usually, they just beat
the living hell out of me.

13:39.385 --> 13:40.885
It finally worked.

13:40.886 --> 13:41.886
Boy, is he dumb.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.888
Why did you do that?

13:43.889 --> 13:46.391
Why? Because
he's an obnoxious jerk.

13:46.392 --> 13:47.392
I wasn't crazy

13:47.393 --> 13:48.393
about the way he treated you,

13:48.394 --> 13:49.894
or me, for that matter.

13:49.895 --> 13:52.897
What a creep, a real loser.

13:52.898 --> 13:53.898
Why are you crying?

13:54.900 --> 13:56.401
I'm not crying.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.402
Oh, you see,

13:57.403 --> 13:58.903
with the tears
and the heavy sobbing,

13:58.904 --> 14:00.905
I just naturally
assumed you were.

14:00.906 --> 14:01.906
You're probably wondering

14:01.907 --> 14:03.908
what kind of person
marries a jerk like that.

14:03.909 --> 14:08.413
Well, only some other jerk.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.415
Jerk?

14:10.416 --> 14:12.917
You're the greatest thing
that ever happened to me,

14:12.918 --> 14:14.919
and no one can make you
look any different.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.921
Oh, Billy.

14:16.922 --> 14:17.922
I'm gonna go.

14:17.923 --> 14:18.923
You're real upset,

14:18.924 --> 14:20.925
and you should be by
yourself for awhile.

14:20.926 --> 14:21.966
Okay? I'll see you Monday.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.431
Pleasant dreams.

14:26.432 --> 14:27.933
I'll see you.

14:38.444 --> 14:39.945
Could you drive me home?

14:51.957 --> 14:53.458
Hello.
Mary.

14:53.459 --> 14:54.459
Goodbye.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.460
Mary, wait a minute. Mary.

14:55.461 --> 14:56.461
Goodbye, Burt.
Mary, wait a minute.

14:56.462 --> 14:57.462
What's going on here?

14:57.463 --> 14:59.464
I call you yesterday,
ask you to meet me,

14:59.465 --> 15:01.466
you tell me you're coming,
I wait all night, no Mary.

15:01.467 --> 15:02.967
Really?
I slept in the park.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.970
Oh, and who was that
grabbing me all night,

15:05.971 --> 15:08.473
your double?

15:08.474 --> 15:09.974
Who told you?

15:09.975 --> 15:10.975
Goodbye, Burt.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.977
Mary, Mary, wait...

15:12.978 --> 15:14.479
You call me
and tell me to see you,

15:14.480 --> 15:15.980
and then when I see you,

15:15.981 --> 15:17.482
you tell me
I never spoke to you...

15:17.483 --> 15:18.483
And now you call me again

15:18.484 --> 15:19.984
and ask me why I didn't come

15:19.985 --> 15:21.986
when you already told me
you didn't tell me to.

15:21.987 --> 15:23.988
I also told you,
if you remember,

15:23.989 --> 15:24.989
not to talk to me

15:24.990 --> 15:28.493
if you saw me until you saw me.

15:28.494 --> 15:29.494
Listen, Burt,

15:29.495 --> 15:30.995
if you're trying
to drive me crazy,

15:30.996 --> 15:32.497
it's worked, okay?

15:32.498 --> 15:33.998
I'm crazy.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.500
I don't know
why you're doing this,

15:35.501 --> 15:36.501
but it worked.

15:36.502 --> 15:40.004
I am properly
and certifiably bananas.

15:40.005 --> 15:41.506
It's nice talking to you.

15:41.507 --> 15:43.508
While you're at Kline's,
would you pick up some Gleem?

15:43.509 --> 15:44.509
We're almost out.

15:44.510 --> 15:46.010
Mary, Mary, please listen to me.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.011
Listen to me, Mary.

15:47.012 --> 15:49.013
If you love me, please,
just listen to me.

15:49.014 --> 15:52.016
Okay, what?

15:52.017 --> 15:56.021
Don't listen to me.

16:00.526 --> 16:01.526
Goodbye, Burt.

16:01.527 --> 16:02.527
Mary, no, listen.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.028
Mary, please...

16:04.029 --> 16:06.030
Mary, just have faith
that what I say is true,

16:06.031 --> 16:07.031
just don't listen to me.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.033
When you get here,
you can listen to me.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.034
What have you got to lose?

16:10.035 --> 16:12.537
Burt, just come home, okay?

16:12.538 --> 16:14.038
Mare, I can't come home.

16:14.039 --> 16:15.540
Now, please come to me.

16:15.541 --> 16:16.541
Burt.

16:16.542 --> 16:17.542
And remember, now,

16:17.543 --> 16:19.043
if you see me along the way,

16:19.044 --> 16:22.547
don't you talk to me.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.048
If I see you
along the way, Burt,

16:24.049 --> 16:27.051
I'll probably kill you.

16:27.052 --> 16:28.052
Hey, Mare.
What?

16:28.053 --> 16:30.055
I love you.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.072
Get.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.074
Shh, it's okay, honey.
It's okay.

16:50.075 --> 16:52.577
Get.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.579
Get.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.080
Get, get.

16:56.081 --> 17:00.084
Why don't you carry a shotgun?

17:00.085 --> 17:01.085
It was a bee, Corinne.

17:01.086 --> 17:03.087
What's it gonna do,
drill through the netting?

17:03.088 --> 17:05.089
It could happen.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.590
Once, on a movie of the week,

17:06.592 --> 17:07.592
they ate through the roof

17:07.593 --> 17:10.595
of a Volkswagen.

17:10.596 --> 17:11.596
Hi.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.097
Hi.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.098
Jodie, you've gotta
relax a little.

17:15.099 --> 17:16.601
I know what you mean.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.603
Don't worry, you'll calm down.

17:18.604 --> 17:21.105
Hmm.

17:21.106 --> 17:22.106
Well...

17:22.107 --> 17:23.608
I've taken a leave
of absence from work

17:23.608 --> 17:25.108
till I can find a nanny,

17:25.109 --> 17:27.111
but I haven't been able
to find anyone I like.

17:27.112 --> 17:28.112
What are you looking for?

17:28.113 --> 17:30.114
Mary Poppins.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.115
Listen, Jodie,

17:31.116 --> 17:34.118
God was very smart
when he made babies.

17:34.119 --> 17:35.119
First, he gave them

17:35.120 --> 17:37.121
a foolproof means
of communication:

17:37.122 --> 17:38.122
screaming.

17:38.123 --> 17:40.625
Second, he didn't
make them out of glass,

17:40.626 --> 17:43.628
and third, and most important...

17:43.629 --> 17:45.631
he invented apple juice.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.634
Once you relax,
it's really a lot of fun.

17:49.635 --> 17:52.136
Yeah, I guess I've been
alone too much.

17:52.137 --> 17:54.639
I'm feeling so much better
just talking to you.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.641
Jodie, you've gotta
get out more.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.142
What, and leave Wendy?

17:58.143 --> 18:00.645
Listen, I've got
a proposition to make.

18:00.646 --> 18:05.149
I need a place where I can go
and be alone sometimes.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.652
At home, I've got no privacy.

18:07.653 --> 18:08.653
I mean, before Tim left,

18:08.654 --> 18:10.655
he was always
in the room praying,

18:10.656 --> 18:13.157
and it was really hard
to polish my toenails

18:13.158 --> 18:14.159
during High Mass.

18:16.662 --> 18:17.662
Now that he's gone,

18:17.663 --> 18:21.666
everybody's always coming in
and trying to cheer me up...

18:21.667 --> 18:23.668
So how about if sometimes

18:23.669 --> 18:26.671
I come over to your place
and take care of both babies

18:26.672 --> 18:28.172
and get a little privacy

18:28.173 --> 18:31.175
while you go out
and get a little bit of life?

18:31.176 --> 18:33.177
You got yourself a deal,
Corinne...

18:33.178 --> 18:35.680
And listen, it works both ways.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.181
I mean, since you're
a single lady now,

18:37.182 --> 18:39.183
feel free to leave
little Timmy with me

18:39.184 --> 18:40.685
when you want to go out and...

18:40.686 --> 18:41.686
you know.

18:41.687 --> 18:42.687
You mean it?

18:42.688 --> 18:43.688
Absolutely, anytime.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.190
Oh, great.
See you Tuesday.

19:08.213 --> 19:09.213
Hello.

19:09.214 --> 19:11.215
Come in X-23. Come in.

19:11.216 --> 19:12.216
Prepare to be beamed back.

19:12.217 --> 19:14.719
I'm not coming back.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.220
Please, X-23,

19:16.221 --> 19:17.722
you are to come back
immediately.

19:17.723 --> 19:18.723
What are you, crazy?

19:18.724 --> 19:20.725
With what I've got
going on down here,

19:20.726 --> 19:21.726
forget about it.

19:21.727 --> 19:24.729
X-23, you are in violation
of our bylaws.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.731
I don't care. I'm staying.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.733
Come on. What are you, crazy?

19:28.734 --> 19:30.735
Listen, I haven't had
so much fun in my entire life,

19:30.736 --> 19:33.738
and I'm 16,000 years old.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.740
Know what they got down here?

19:35.741 --> 19:39.243
They got unlimited whoopee.

19:39.244 --> 19:41.245
So they may not live forever,

19:41.246 --> 19:44.248
but when they live, whoo,
they're really living.

19:44.249 --> 19:45.750
So I ain't coming back,

19:45.751 --> 19:50.254
and don't try to beam me back
because I'm jamming my beamer.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.257
I can't say I blame him.

19:53.258 --> 19:55.760
All because of this sex business
of yours.

19:55.761 --> 19:59.263
If I remember correctly,
it was worth it.

19:59.264 --> 20:01.766
Then we must beam up
the real Burt.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.267
Why?

20:03.268 --> 20:04.769
Saul, we've got
a lot of our people

20:04.770 --> 20:05.770
down there.

20:05.771 --> 20:06.771
If your people
discover two Burts,

20:06.772 --> 20:08.272
they are going to get
suspicious.

20:08.273 --> 20:10.274
Start beaming procedure.

20:11.276 --> 20:13.778
Mare, come on. Mary come on.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.280
It's just a few blocks.

20:19.785 --> 20:21.285
May I have
a chocolate soda, please?

20:21.286 --> 20:23.788
You know, it's 400 calories,
but what they hell.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.790
I mean, you gotta live
a little bit here.

20:25.791 --> 20:26.791
You know what I mean?

20:26.792 --> 20:28.292
Mare, come on. Mare.

20:28.293 --> 20:29.293
Mare.

20:31.296 --> 20:32.296
Mare, it's you.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.297
You're here.

20:33.298 --> 20:34.298
You're here. Thank God.

20:34.299 --> 20:36.300
Burt, what in the world
are you doing?

20:36.301 --> 20:37.301
You won't believe this.

20:37.302 --> 20:38.302
I'm sure I won't.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.805
Sit down.

20:40.806 --> 20:43.307
You call me,
you tell me to meet you,

20:43.308 --> 20:46.310
and, if on the way to meet you
I see you in the house,

20:46.311 --> 20:47.311
I should ignore you.

20:47.312 --> 20:48.813
Right.
Because that isn't you.

20:48.814 --> 20:49.814
Exactly. That's him.

20:49.815 --> 20:50.815
Who?
My double.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.316
Your double?

20:52.317 --> 20:54.319
The little silver guy
who looks just like me.

20:56.822 --> 20:59.824
Thank you.

20:59.825 --> 21:03.327
Burt, you remember
Dr. Medlow?

21:03.328 --> 21:04.829
He helped you
when you were invisible.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.330
You remember
when you were invisible?

21:06.331 --> 21:08.332
Mary, no. Mary, please.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.334
This is different here.
This is real.

21:10.335 --> 21:11.836
These are real space people.

21:11.837 --> 21:13.838
You remember you used to
snap your fingers

21:13.839 --> 21:15.339
and think no one could see you?

21:15.340 --> 21:16.340
Mary, please, I'm telling you,

21:16.341 --> 21:17.842
they beamed me up
to their spaceship.

21:20.345 --> 21:21.345
Mary, I'm telling you,

21:21.346 --> 21:23.347
they beamed me up
to their spaceship.

21:23.348 --> 21:24.348
They can do that,

21:24.349 --> 21:25.850
and they sent my double
back down here.

21:25.851 --> 21:26.851
Mare, they can...

21:26.852 --> 21:29.855
They zapped me just like that:

21:34.860 --> 21:37.862
Oh, my God.

21:37.863 --> 21:38.863
Burt?

21:38.864 --> 21:42.366
Burt?

21:42.367 --> 21:46.370
Oh! Oh, Burt, I'm sorry.

21:46.371 --> 21:50.375
You can make yourself invisible.

21:53.378 --> 21:55.880
Uh... you do...

21:55.881 --> 21:58.883
Um... he was just...

22:00.886 --> 22:01.886
I...

22:03.388 --> 22:05.890
Hi.

22:11.396 --> 22:12.396
This is incredible.

22:12.397 --> 22:13.397
It was up, and then when I...

22:13.398 --> 22:14.899
My God!

22:14.900 --> 22:16.400
What is it with you people?

22:16.401 --> 22:18.402
Sorry, Burt.

22:18.403 --> 22:20.404
Come on, fellows, have a heart.

22:20.405 --> 22:21.906
They got no hearts, Burt.

22:21.907 --> 22:23.407
It's all wires.

22:23.408 --> 22:26.911
You're pleading
with a microwave oven here.

22:26.912 --> 22:28.412
We tried to beam back
your duplicate,

22:28.413 --> 22:29.914
but he will not come,

22:29.915 --> 22:31.415
and we cannot have
two of you there.

22:31.416 --> 22:32.917
What do you mean
he won't come back?

22:32.918 --> 22:34.919
He took one look at your wife

22:34.920 --> 22:35.920
and jammed his beamer...

22:35.921 --> 22:37.922
if you get my drift.

22:37.923 --> 22:38.923
We are sorry, Burt.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.424
Wait a minute.

22:40.425 --> 22:41.425
Let me talk to this guy.

22:41.426 --> 22:42.927
I'll get him to come back.

22:42.928 --> 22:44.428
Just let me talk to him, please.

22:44.429 --> 22:45.930
No, you will never
get him to agree.

22:45.931 --> 22:46.931
Come on. Come on.

22:46.932 --> 22:48.933
Listen, let me try, all right?

22:48.934 --> 22:49.934
Just let me...
Give him...

22:49.935 --> 22:51.936
Give him a chance,
for God's sake.

22:51.937 --> 22:53.437
If he can do it,
you'll beam him back.

22:53.438 --> 22:54.939
Let me talk to him.

22:54.940 --> 22:55.940
Just let me talk to him.

22:55.941 --> 22:56.941
All right,

22:56.942 --> 22:58.442
but you have only one chance.

22:58.443 --> 22:59.944
If you cannot get him to return,

22:59.945 --> 23:00.945
you will be beamed
back here forever.

23:00.946 --> 23:02.446
All right. Good.

23:02.447 --> 23:03.447
That's all right.
Let's go.

23:03.448 --> 23:04.949
Good luck, Burt.
Good luck.

23:04.950 --> 23:06.951
Remember, you have
just one chance.

23:06.952 --> 23:08.453
Right.

23:09.454 --> 23:10.955
Oh, Saul.

23:10.956 --> 23:11.957
I wouldn't...

23:17.963 --> 23:19.464
What?

23:28.473 --> 23:30.474
ANNOUNCER:
<i>What will happen now that alien Burt</i>

23:30.475 --> 23:31.976
<i>refuses to return</i>

23:34.980 --> 23:35.980
<i>Can they both stay with Mary?</i>

23:35.981 --> 23:37.481
<i>Is there enough drawer space?</i>

23:37.482 --> 23:39.483
<i>Now that Dutch</i>
<i>is living with the Tates,</i>

23:39.484 --> 23:40.484

23:43.989 --> 23:45.990
<i>Burt is purposely trying</i>
<i>to drive her crazy,</i>

23:45.991 --> 23:47.491
