- A pig?

I don't wanna talk.

- I'm sorry.

You never get me up

I'm up! I'm freaking up.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.993
And you know why I'm up?

01:17.076 --> 01:19.829
{\an1}Because I [bleep] slept

coming from, Nicole?

01:31.508 --> 01:33.343

in the living room?

01:33.426 --> 01:37.263

for you. Where were you?

01:37.347 --> 01:39.015
'Went to [bleep] Vinny's bed.'

01:41.601 --> 01:43.937
{\an1}Jenni, at this point
I don't give a [bleep].

{\an1}I don't care
if me and Jionni are done

01:46.606 --> 01:48.274

{\an4}<i>(Nicole)</i>
<i>Honestly,</i>

"We're done" on the phone

01:52.111 --> 01:53.488
{\an8}and that's why
I just went crazy.

01:53.571 --> 01:56.699
{\an7}It was just,
it was a rebound reaction.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.911
{\an7}- How drunk were you?
- Not that drunk.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.037
{\an1}'Cause I really have
to talk to you anyways

- Mike?
- Yeah.

02:06.167 --> 02:09.002

how I defended you last night.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.804
{\an7}I looked Mike dead in the face
and I go, "I am telling Nicole."

02:17.887 --> 02:19.931
{\an7}I was like, "She will never
choose you over Jionni.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.057
Get that through your head."

02:21.140 --> 02:23.768

she [bleep] sure as hell

she was [bleep] my [bleep]."

{\an1}<i>(Nicole)</i>
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

{\an7}Yeah, I watched [bleep] Ryder
get with his friend

02:34.237 --> 02:35.196
{\an8}and that was hot, whatever

02:35.280 --> 02:37.740
{\an8}but I didn't [bleep]
get with Mike.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.410
{\an8}<i>And Mike was so upset that</i>
<i>I wouldn't hook up with him</i>

02:40.493 --> 02:41.619
{\an8}'cause he's not used
to rejection.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.414
{\an8}<i>I wanna hairspray him</i>

02:44.497 --> 02:45.915

so much screaming, yo?

- Get out of my room.

'Me get out of your room?'

02:49.502 --> 02:50.795
- Yeah.
- 'For real?'

02:50.879 --> 02:52.255
{\an1}Everyone's telling me what
the [bleep] you said about me.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.299
{\an1}- 'I didn't say anything.'
- We're not friends.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.675
{\an1}Maybe you should talk to me
first.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.218
{\an1}- 'We're not friends.'
- It's all good, Snooks.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.178
{\an1}- 'You're so mean.'
- I'm tired of being Mr. Nice.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.639
{\an1}Alright? Talk to me first
before you talk to 16 others.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.350
- 'I don't want to.'
- Talk to me first!

03:04.434 --> 03:05.268
I'm always nice.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.437
{\an1}Don't [bleep] yell at me

'We're not friends.
Fine, Snooks.'

03:09.022 --> 03:10.940
{\an1}- 'We're not friends.'
- Fine, so get out of my room.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.442

the fugitive right now

03:16.029 --> 03:18.239
{\an7}and I'm harboring information.
You know what I'm saying?

03:18.323 --> 03:21.075
{\an7}Don't talk [bleep] and you won't
feel like a [bleep] douchebag.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.285
That's all I have to say.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.912
{\an8}I just need my best friend.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.497
{\an7}So I'm like, "Jenni,
we're going to get mimosas."

03:27.373 --> 03:28.333
I hate you.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.794
{\an1}- Are you ready, Nicole?
- Yeah, let's go.

{\an1}I'm so tired right now,
you crazy whore.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.299
{\an1}They better have mimosas
at this breakfast

03:36.382 --> 03:39.093

I'm going back to Jersey.

{\an4}<i>(Mike)</i>
<i>I've to teach her a lesson,</i>
<i>have to teach Nicole a lesson</i>

{\an8}and the truth has to come out.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.391
{\an7}<i>So let me just call my boy,</i>
<i>Unit, just to refresh my memory</i>

03:45.475 --> 03:49.145
{\an7}on what really happened
that night between me and Nicole

03:49.228 --> 03:50.813
{\an8}my friend, Unit, and Ryder.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.231
{\an8}- 'Yo.'
- Yo, what up?

03:52.315 --> 03:53.650
- 'What up, homey?'
- Yo.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.526
{\an1}You remember when you were
banging Snooki's friend, Ryder?

03:55.610 --> 03:57.654
{\an1}- 'Ryder. Yeah, yeah.'
- Somehow that story got out.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.407
{\an1}You know, through the day and
there's just been mad arguments.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.118
{\an1}- 'Really?'
- I know you knew 100% about it.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.663
{\an1}You were banging Ryder and then
Snooki got a little horny

04:06.746 --> 04:08.247
{\an1}so she got on her [bleep]
real quick.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.711
{\an7}I, I definitely did put her on
blast, but you know what I mean.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.213
{\an8}Snooki turned from 4'9"

04:15.296 --> 04:18.507
{\an7}to about 2'9".
You know what I'm saying?

04:18.591 --> 04:19.884
{\an8}And then after that she said

04:19.968 --> 04:21.928
{\an7}"Don't ever, ever, ever,
ever say anything."

04:22.011 --> 04:23.888

I just need you in my life.

I jumped out of bed.

{\an7}that you can't believe

{\an1}said, "Call him up
and tell him what happened."

{\an7}But in reality,
all I did is call Unit

06:06.199 --> 06:09.452

together and laughed about it.

{\an1}I got Jionni's number
out the phone book and gave it.

{\an1}So why is she telling me,
"I hate you. Don't talk to me?"

07:22.441 --> 07:24.235
{\an1}You talk to her,
but you should talk to her

07:24.318 --> 07:26.112
{\an1}before you go to that level
of calling your friend

07:26.195 --> 07:27.446

That's [bleep] up.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.948

35:52.108 --> 35:55.194
{\an7}I will remember this Sicily trip
for the rest of my life.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.572
{\an1}<i>I brought my family with me</i>

35:57.655 --> 36:01.075

37:07.433 --> 37:09.143
{\an7}Yes, I wouldn't be
talking to you right now.

37:09.226 --> 37:10.686
- Are you kidding?
- 'Right.'

37:15.149 --> 37:17.443

{\an8}[screams]
Sorry!

37:33.167 --> 37:37.171
{\an7}I'm so happy

37:51.686 --> 37:54.981
{\an8}Hm. Ee.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.107
{\an8}Oh!

38:02.613 --> 38:03.698
- Yo.
- 'Hi, girls.'

38:03.781 --> 38:04.740
{\an1}Hey!

38:06.409 --> 38:08.411
{\an1}- Mm, I missed you so much.
- Yeah?

38:09.954 --> 38:11.247
Can we talk about
the other night

38:11.330 --> 38:13.374
so I know what to tell Jionni?

38:13.457 --> 38:14.709
What do you mean what happened?

38:14.792 --> 38:16.877
{\an1}I asked you if you were drunk.
You said no.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.462
{\an4}<i>(Nicole)</i>
<i>I wanna know what happened</i>
<i>between us</i>

38:18.546 --> 38:19.839
<i>'cause I don't exactly know.</i>

38:19.922 --> 38:22.174
{\an7}Like, did we have sex and stuff?
Like, I have no idea.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.343
{\an7}What, you can't remember
what you did?

38:24.427 --> 38:27.888
That's how drunk you were?
I don't, don't believe you.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.391
I remember certain things
that I don't wanna say.

38:30.474 --> 38:33.561
Sid we [bleep] smush?

38:33.644 --> 38:36.689
{\an1}Don't say [bleep]. I just
wanna know what to tell him.

38:36.772 --> 38:37.732
You wanna know
every little detail?

38:37.815 --> 38:39.066
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.651
Alright, let's go outside.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.528
{\an5}<i>(Vinny)</i>
<i>It was like a glitch</i>
<i>in the Matrix.</i>

38:42.611 --> 38:44.238
{\an1}<i>Like, everything is happening</i>
<i>the way it's supposed to be</i>

38:44.321 --> 38:45.823
{\an8}then all of a sudden
glitch in the Matrix.

38:45.906 --> 38:47.700
{\an8}Whoa, bang Snooki,
and then everything

38:47.783 --> 38:49.618
{\an7}just continued the way
it was happening before.

38:49.702 --> 38:52.538
{\an1}So you were in my bed, you
climbed into my bed and then...

38:54.415 --> 38:56.292
{\an1}...whatever,
we were just cuddling.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.085
'And then, like,
you started, like'

38:58.169 --> 38:59.545
'kissing my neck a little bit.'

38:59.628 --> 39:01.422
{\an1}And then you just kept saying,
like, "[bleep] me."

39:01.505 --> 39:02.923
[laughing]

39:03.007 --> 39:04.300
Stop, stop.

39:04.383 --> 39:06.886
{\an1}- You were [bleep] horny.
- Stop it!

39:06.969 --> 39:07.803
{\an1}Vinny,
you don't have to say that!

39:07.887 --> 39:10.306
{\an1}Oh, my God!
Why would you say that?

39:10.389 --> 39:12.600
- Oh, my God.
- Whatever.

39:12.683 --> 39:15.603
{\an1}I thought we were just, like,
cuddling and...

39:17.688 --> 39:20.316
{\an1}My [bleep] was cuddling
with your [bleep], but...

39:20.399 --> 39:22.276
I have to tell him.

39:22.943 --> 39:25.279
Tell him. Don't lie.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.075
{\an4}<i>(Nicole)</i>
<i>I really, honestly thought</i>
<i>we didn't have sex.</i>

39:29.158 --> 39:32.453
{\an8}Like, I blacked out a little
bit. What are you gonna do?

39:32.536 --> 39:35.331
Freaking out. Just go somewhere.

39:35.414 --> 39:37.333
{\an1}<i>And I told Jionni</i>
<i>that we just [bleep] popped.</i>

39:37.416 --> 39:40.461
{\an7}Now I have to call him back
and say

39:40.544 --> 39:43.881
{\an7}"Well, you sittin' down?
We actually really had sex."

39:43.964 --> 39:46.384

39:53.015 --> 39:54.600
{\an7}- You're gonna hate me.
- 'What?'

39:54.683 --> 39:59.188
{\an8}Remember what I told you
what happened with Vinny?

39:59.271 --> 40:02.274
{\an7}- 'Yes.'
- Something more happened.

40:02.358 --> 40:04.860
{\an8}- 'What?'
- Uh...

40:06.403 --> 40:07.696
