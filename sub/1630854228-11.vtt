job going with Santiago?

00:04.003 --> 00:06.066
- Ugh.
He's a terrible contractor.

00:06.166 --> 00:08.148
He keeps on making changes
without my approval,

00:08.248 --> 00:10.430
and then when I ask him why
he did it, he's all like,

00:10.530 --> 00:12.152
"It's better this way."

00:12.252 --> 00:14.194
- So patronising.
- Mom, I think that's enough.

00:14.294 --> 00:17.197
- Enough? Oh, no, Camila,
I could go on and on.

00:17.297 --> 00:19.359

- Oh.

still arguing with her

00:23.783 --> 00:25.845
Your own personal

00:25.945 --> 00:27.407
Bet you're pretty
happy about that.

00:27.507 --> 00:29.489
- Ha-ha.
- Get it? 'Cause he's Cuban.

00:29.589 --> 00:30.890
- Yeah, I got it.
- And the missile

00:30.990 --> 00:31.972
- would be his...
- Yeah, no, I said

00:32.072 --> 00:33.533
I got it, man. Look...

00:33.633 --> 00:35.255
I just want what's best
for her, you know?

00:35.355 --> 00:37.337
And if that means that her
partnership with Santiago

00:37.437 --> 00:40.620
blows up, and she partners
with a less attractive,

00:40.720 --> 00:44.824
possibly female contractor...
so be it.

00:44.924 --> 00:46.506
- And I can't say anything
about the way he treats me,

00:46.606 --> 00:48.548
'cause then I'll be
labeled as "difficult."

00:48.648 --> 00:50.430
- Marina, this is
classic workplace sexism.

00:50.530 --> 00:51.671
You have to speak up.

00:51.771 --> 00:53.473

- Whoa.

00:57.537 --> 00:59.119

to the Infection

stand up to this guy.

Mija, you're right.

I'm gonna go to him

01:09.189 --> 01:11.891

with some respect,

someone in this lot

and cook it in the--

16:37.356 --> 16:40.339
- On the stove.
- ...on the stove, obviously.

16:40.439 --> 16:41.700
Come on,
who's the houseboy here?

16:41.800 --> 16:43.802
[chuckles]

16:44.443 --> 16:48.707
Okay, easy peasy,
grilled cheesy.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.269
Connor!

16:50.369 --> 16:52.471
[groans]

16:52.571 --> 16:54.873
What did we say about
you touching the stove?

16:54.973 --> 16:57.356
Uh, who is this?

16:57.456 --> 16:59.398
- Oh, this is Lupe.
She...

16:59.498 --> 17:02.481
- She's the...
next door neighbour.

17:02.581 --> 17:04.563
Yeah, she's also super rich.

17:04.663 --> 17:06.665
Right, Lupe?

17:08.627 --> 17:10.569
Yes. I'm wealthy.

17:10.669 --> 17:12.331
My father made his fortune
in blood diamonds,

17:12.431 --> 17:14.093
so I grew up in privilege.

17:14.193 --> 17:16.495
But I always knew that our
wealth came at a price,

17:16.595 --> 17:18.857
which is why I have devoted
myself to philanthropy

17:18.957 --> 17:21.660
and running my foundation,
the Lupe Moreno Initiative,

17:21.760 --> 17:23.502
which seeks to repair
the damage

17:23.602 --> 17:26.625
caused by the unethical
harvesting of mine diamonds.

17:26.725 --> 17:28.467
Whoa.

17:28.567 --> 17:30.809
Sometimes I forget all that.

17:31.690 --> 17:34.613
- And you don't want
Connor touching the stove?

17:35.694 --> 17:38.437
- There was once a fire at
our summer home in Vienna.

17:38.537 --> 17:41.200
Ever since, I have made
it my mission to campaign

17:41.300 --> 17:42.801
against open flame.

17:42.901 --> 17:44.843
Anyway, I'm going to return
to my mansion next door now

17:44.943 --> 17:47.666
with my dry cleaning.

17:49.908 --> 17:51.990
I wear men's pants.

17:54.833 --> 17:56.295
Okay.

17:56.395 --> 17:59.818
Does anyone want to
tell me what's going on?

17:59.918 --> 18:01.920
Connor?

18:03.081 --> 18:04.183
She's my housekeeper.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.385
Denise is my sister-in-law.

18:06.485 --> 18:07.946
I'm not a houseboy.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.048
I'm a-I'm a mansion boy,
a mansion man.

18:11.210 --> 18:12.471
I'm sorry.

18:12.571 --> 18:14.713
- Ugh. I should
have known when you said

18:14.813 --> 18:16.815
you had to call a bus.

18:19.138 --> 18:21.180
You don't deserve
to use coupons.

18:24.343 --> 18:25.884
My mom was right.

18:25.984 --> 18:28.287
I'm only attracted to liars
and guys who play bass.

18:28.387 --> 18:29.888
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

18:29.988 --> 18:31.130
That was dumb.

18:31.230 --> 18:32.651
It's just that, I don't know.

18:32.751 --> 18:35.134
We met and we clicked,
and it was great.

18:35.234 --> 18:37.936
And then...you said
you hated rich guys.

18:38.036 --> 18:39.818
And I didn't want
you to hate me.

18:39.918 --> 18:41.340
So you lied?

18:41.440 --> 18:43.582
- Yeah, but not
about everything.

18:43.682 --> 18:45.944
I mean, besides being one
of the Bay Area's leading

18:46.044 --> 18:47.906
private equity investors,
I really am that guy

18:48.006 --> 18:49.508
that you met at the store.

18:49.608 --> 18:52.030
I'm a divorced dad
of an awesome daughter.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.132
And I like you.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.636
And I like saving money
with coupons.

18:57.736 --> 18:59.718
- Oh my--it's
literally just free money

18:59.818 --> 19:02.341
- sitting on the table.
- That's what I'm saying!

19:03.462 --> 19:07.626
So would you...consider
giving me a second chance?

19:10.749 --> 19:12.411
I did like the fanny pack.

19:12.511 --> 19:14.513
Is that a "yes"?

19:16.435 --> 19:18.437
Maybe.

19:18.917 --> 19:22.160
- I'll take it.
I got a "maybe."

19:24.122 --> 19:25.344
Hola.

19:25.444 --> 19:26.785
Oh, hey.

19:26.885 --> 19:28.467
- Sorry about
dinner last night.

19:28.567 --> 19:29.828
Oh, that's all right.

19:29.928 --> 19:31.790
I've had worse steak.

19:31.890 --> 19:33.892
Actually, I haven't.

19:35.093 --> 19:37.196
- Uh, this is going
to sound silly,

19:37.296 --> 19:40.999
but Tom is a little sensitive
about us working together,

19:41.099 --> 19:43.202
especially
because you're, well,

19:43.302 --> 19:44.723
you've looked in the mirror.

19:44.823 --> 19:48.207
Anyway, I told him
that obviously

19:48.307 --> 19:50.489
everything between us
is just business.

19:50.589 --> 19:52.591
Totally.

19:53.472 --> 19:54.813
Unless it's not.

19:54.913 --> 19:56.695
Ha, right.

19:56.795 --> 19:57.816
What?

19:57.916 --> 19:59.618
Marina...

19:59.718 --> 20:02.821
<i>[jazzy seductive music]</i>

20:02.921 --> 20:04.102
Let's stop playing games.

20:04.202 --> 20:05.464
- Oh, I--I--

20:05.564 --> 20:07.146
I didn't know
we were playing games.

20:07.246 --> 20:08.587
W-what games?

20:08.687 --> 20:10.429
Scrabble?

20:10.529 --> 20:12.471
Yahtzee?

20:16.655 --> 20:18.397

20:18.497 --> 20:21.840
- Good morning
mi esposa hermosa.

20:21.940 --> 20:24.062
[alarm stops]
Breakfast in bed for milady.

20:25.904 --> 20:27.646
I'm "sor"?

20:27.746 --> 20:29.368
- Yeah, well it was
supposed to say "sorry,"

20:29.468 --> 20:30.929
but I ran out of berries.

20:31.029 --> 20:32.571
Oh.

20:32.671 --> 20:36.335
- I just wanted to say
I'm "sor" for yesterday.

20:36.435 --> 20:38.056
I was being insecure
and jealous.

20:38.156 --> 20:41.980
And plus I'd had that
half of beer, so...

20:42.080 --> 20:43.502
Anyway, I just want
you to know if you

20:43.602 --> 20:45.504
tell me that you're not
attracted to Santiago,

20:45.604 --> 20:47.546
I 100% trust you.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.728
I won't spend another
moment worrying about it.

20:50.689 --> 20:52.691
Me either.

20:55.574 --> 20:57.956
- I was going to spend
the summer in the Hamptons,

20:58.056 --> 21:00.319
but the humidity,
oh, I'm over it.

21:00.419 --> 21:02.000
- Darling,
you must go to Menorca.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.442
It's the new Mallorca.

21:03.542 --> 21:06.965
- How funny, my newest horse
is from Menorca.

21:07.065 --> 21:09.007
- That's a scream.
[both laugh]

21:09.107 --> 21:10.449
Are you guys almost finished?

21:10.549 --> 21:11.730
- What's that, houseboy?
- It's getting late.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.412
I'm hungry.

21:13.512 --> 21:15.414
- Why don't you make yourself
a grilled cheese?

21:15.514 --> 21:16.935
[laughter]

21:17.035 --> 21:18.977
- Gretchen, do you know
how to unlock the stove?

21:19.077 --> 21:21.620
- The houseboy
has quite the attitude.

21:21.720 --> 21:23.622
- Yeah, I'm thinking about
replacing him with a robot.

21:23.722 --> 21:25.724
Now that's an idea.
