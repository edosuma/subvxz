00:36.178 --> 00:39.147
Mmm, something smells good.

00:39.181 --> 00:40.148
(sniffs)

00:40.182 --> 00:41.308
It's the menu.

00:41.350 --> 00:44.683
Ha! Even the menu smells good
at Rattlesnakes!

00:44.720 --> 00:46.711
WOMAN:
Luanne, Luanne...

00:46.756 --> 00:49.554
Hey, Peggy, if I get
the chicken-fried chicken

00:49.592 --> 00:51.924
and you get the chicken-
fried steak, we can...

00:51.961 --> 00:53.121
Just a moment.

00:53.162 --> 00:55.255
There is something that
I must take care of.

00:55.298 --> 00:57.027
I do so know enough

00:57.066 --> 01:00.524
not to put a salad-size fork
in the spoon bin.

01:00.570 --> 01:03.004
Well, that fork
didn’t just walk along

01:03.039 --> 01:06.167
and hop in there by herself,
did she now?

01:06.208 --> 01:07.573
No, she couldn't have.

01:07.610 --> 01:08.770
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:08.811 --> 01:11.143
Why are you calling
my niece a liar?

01:11.180 --> 01:12.647
Luanne knows
we have a way

01:12.682 --> 01:14.650
of doing things here
at Rattlesnakes.

01:14.684 --> 01:15.651
She also knows
the consequences

01:15.685 --> 01:16.777
of not following
that way.

01:16.819 --> 01:18.787
You will not use threats
with her.

01:18.821 --> 01:21.483
And you will not tell me how
to talk to my supervisors.

01:21.524 --> 01:24.857
And you have just lost yourself
a waitress. She quits.

01:24.894 --> 01:26.020
Well, now,
wait a minute.

01:26.062 --> 01:27.461
I wasn't going
to fire her.

01:27.496 --> 01:29.396
Mm-hmm, it's too late
for your apologies

01:29.432 --> 01:30.399
now isn't it?

01:30.433 --> 01:32.401
Luanne, pick up your clothes
and three onion loaves.

01:32.435 --> 01:33.561
We are going home.

01:33.603 --> 01:40.509
You know,
I probably

01:40.543 --> 01:44.104
wouldn't have lost
my Rattlesnakes job

01:44.146 --> 01:45.909
if you hadn’t said anything.

01:45.948 --> 01:48.314
Exactly. But I won't
be around forever

01:48.351 --> 01:49.613
to do everything for you.

01:49.652 --> 01:52.086
You have to learn
to help yourself.

01:52.121 --> 01:54.715
How did it help me
to lose my job?

01:54.757 --> 01:56.816
It will leave you open
for new opportunities.

01:56.859 --> 01:59.555
Such as the one that I am
about to present to you.

01:59.595 --> 02:01.927
The Learning Annex
is offering a class

02:01.964 --> 02:04.057
on "The Joy
of Entrepreneuring."

02:04.100 --> 02:05.158
I signed you up.

02:05.201 --> 02:08.364
It would be really nice
if sometimes you could ask me

02:08.404 --> 02:11.430
when you make decisions
about my life.

02:11.474 --> 02:14.204
You're right.

02:14.243 --> 02:16.768
Would you like to go
at 7:00 or at 9:00?

02:16.812 --> 02:19.372
Mmm... 7:00.

02:19.415 --> 02:21.383
I'm sorry,
that won't work for me.

02:21.417 --> 02:23.715
A lot of you think
of Trip Larsen

02:23.753 --> 02:25.914
as the hog king of Arlen.

02:25.955 --> 02:28.480
But he wasn't born
with that crown on his head.

02:28.524 --> 02:29.957
He's an entrepreneur

02:29.992 --> 02:32.187
an innovator,
and an inventor

02:32.228 --> 02:36.790
responsible for edibilizing
two new parts of the pig.

02:36.832 --> 02:40.097
(light applause)

02:40.136 --> 02:42.263
Thank you. Thank you.

02:42.304 --> 02:45.239
My great-grandfather
started Larsen Pork Products

02:45.274 --> 02:48.107
with little more than three pigs
and a killing hammer.

02:48.144 --> 02:51.841
Today, I'm proud to say,
we kill more pigs than

02:51.881 --> 02:53.781
well, pig hepatitis.

02:53.816 --> 02:55.784
There's no secret to success,
really.

02:55.818 --> 02:58.082
You have to have a passion
for whatever you do

02:58.120 --> 03:00.452
whether it's processing pigs
or sheep

03:00.489 --> 03:03.185
or cattle into food
and food products.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.455
(whispering):
What's a food product?

03:05.494 --> 03:06.791
It's like food,
but cheaper.

03:06.829 --> 03:11.289
Hmm...

03:11.333 --> 03:12.857
Young lady, you had a question?

03:12.902 --> 03:17.805
Yes. I find that I am
too busy succeeding

03:17.840 --> 03:19.899
to keep track
of all of my ideas.

03:19.942 --> 03:23.241
So, I keep them in a file.

03:23.279 --> 03:26.442
Well, actually, that's more
of a comment than a question.

03:26.482 --> 03:28.450
Well, thank you.
I think so, too.

03:34.290 --> 03:35.257
Well, hello.

03:35.291 --> 03:36.258
How did you
like my lecture?

03:36.292 --> 03:37.259
Did you enjoy it?

03:37.293 --> 03:38.260
I mean, did you enjoy it

03:38.294 --> 03:40.319
as much as I enjoyed
having you at my lecture?

03:40.362 --> 03:42.193
I really liked the part

03:42.231 --> 03:45.200
where you were excited
about what you do.

03:45.234 --> 03:47.429
That's what I'm
trying to find...

03:47.470 --> 03:49.301
a career I'm passionate about.

03:49.338 --> 03:51.533
Like waitressing
at a steak house...

03:51.574 --> 03:53.804
You know, you have
that special...

03:53.843 --> 03:55.811
I don't know...
unspoiled quality

03:55.845 --> 03:57.005
and something tells me

03:57.046 --> 04:00.379
I think you'd do
pretty darn well in pork.

04:00.416 --> 04:02.384
How'd you like to interview
for a position

04:02.418 --> 04:03.385
with Larsen Pork Products?

04:03.419 --> 04:08.447
Well, I did work with
pork chops in my last job.

04:08.491 --> 04:12.689
Well, to be honest,
sometimes I dropped
a couple.

04:12.728 --> 04:15.993
Well, see,
that's the beauty of pork...

04:16.031 --> 04:17.862
it rinses off clean.

04:17.899 --> 04:18.958
Ice cream?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.524
Hey, what are
you celebrating?

04:20.569 --> 04:23.834
Trip Larsen has scheduled
an interview with Luanne.

04:23.873 --> 04:26.865
I get to go to his house!

04:26.909 --> 04:29.935
I don't see why he has
to see her at his house.

04:29.979 --> 04:31.947
You think he could
be interested

04:31.981 --> 04:33.949
in something more
than an interview?

04:33.983 --> 04:35.951
The pork industry
is famously informal.

04:35.985 --> 04:37.953
That's how these things
are done.

04:37.987 --> 04:39.955
Uh, Luanne, sometimes
men aren't interested

04:39.989 --> 04:43.356
in what they say
they're interested in.

04:43.392 --> 04:47.590
To put it bluntly, they're more
interested in something else.

04:47.630 --> 04:48.995
Oh, you mean sex?

04:49.031 --> 04:53.866
N-n-no... no... no...

04:53.903 --> 04:55.871
Yes.

05:05.414 --> 05:07.644
I'm here for my interview,
Mr. Larsen.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.516
I am also here
for her interview.

05:10.553 --> 05:13.317
Luanne,
let's go ballooning.

05:13.355 --> 05:17.849
Peggy, why don't you read
my autobiography?

05:24.500 --> 05:27.492
Oh, it's all so beautiful.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.731
You can see for miles.

05:29.772 --> 05:31.137
Yeah, 3.7 miles.

05:31.173 --> 05:32.538
You can see up
to around eight miles

05:32.575 --> 05:34.406
if you try this monocular.

05:34.443 --> 05:35.933
It's Austrian.

05:35.978 --> 05:38.412
They make the best monocular.

05:38.447 --> 05:39.414
Something wrong?

05:39.448 --> 05:40.415
Well... it's just that...

05:40.449 --> 05:46.319
um, well... you know so much
and I know so little.

05:46.355 --> 05:49.654
I hope that doesn't
make you think I'm stupid.

05:49.692 --> 05:51.182
You are not stupid.

05:51.227 --> 05:52.194
You're ignorant.

05:52.228 --> 05:54.696
What? No, you can't tell...

05:54.730 --> 05:56.197
It's a compliment.

05:56.232 --> 05:58.200
That just means you
haven't had the chance

05:58.234 --> 05:59.201
to learn all
the wrong things.

05:59.235 --> 06:01.465
Oh...

06:01.503 --> 06:03.596
No one's ever told me
that before.

06:03.639 --> 06:06.767
Well, maybe that's because
no one has ever realized

06:06.809 --> 06:08.709
how ignorant you truly are.

06:08.744 --> 06:12.145
PEGGY:
Oh, my Lord!

06:12.181 --> 06:15.582
What are you doing?!

06:15.618 --> 06:22.456
That is not a proper way
to interview!

06:22.491 --> 06:26.723
Ah... Who's house are we
going to T.P. - Ing this year?

06:26.762 --> 06:28.662
Probably
mine again.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.133
So, how'd it go?

06:32.167 --> 06:35.603
Mr. Trip Larsen
is the most wonderful man

06:35.638 --> 06:37.367
in the whole world!

06:37.406 --> 06:40.534
Well, you gave you a job, huh?

06:40.576 --> 06:41.543
What position?

06:41.577 --> 06:43.204
Oh, I'm his girlfriend!

06:43.245 --> 06:45.713
HANK:
Well, I knew this guy
was no good

06:45.748 --> 06:47.215
but braiding your hair?

06:47.249 --> 06:50.946
From the back, your head
looks like a horse's ass.

06:50.986 --> 06:53.784
Well, Trip likes my hair
in braids.

06:53.822 --> 06:55.790
He says they make me look smart.

06:55.824 --> 06:58.691
Luanne, honey, it's not that we
don't like your hair in braids

06:58.727 --> 06:59.694
which we don't

06:59.728 --> 07:01.127
it's that we don't like Trip.

07:01.163 --> 07:03.131
He's old enough
to be your father

07:03.165 --> 07:05.133
and he's treating you
like a child.

07:05.167 --> 07:06.566
Stop worrying,
Aunt Peggy.

07:06.602 --> 07:10.766
And I'm going to eat my
salad after my steak.

07:10.806 --> 07:13.468
Trip says that's
the French way.

07:13.509 --> 07:16.603
So I can have
my dessert first

07:16.645 --> 07:17.942
then my steak.

07:17.980 --> 07:21.541
And then, if I
have room, my salad.

07:21.583 --> 07:23.050
Salad after steak?

07:23.085 --> 07:25.315
I hate to say this
twice in one meal

07:25.354 --> 07:30.121
but, "horse's ass."

07:30.159 --> 07:34.619
(grunts)

07:34.663 --> 07:37.598
(chuckles)

07:37.633 --> 07:39.225
Hello.

07:39.268 --> 07:40.235
We were
in the neighborhood

07:40.269 --> 07:42.737
and thought you might like
some of my Brown Betty.

07:42.771 --> 07:44.898
We can also discuss
my Luanne.

07:44.940 --> 07:45.907
Hey, that's a good idea.

07:45.941 --> 07:46.908
Sounds fun.

07:46.942 --> 07:48.910
How would you like to watch
some football bloopers

07:48.944 --> 07:49.911
while I finish my set?

07:49.945 --> 07:52.379
You know, they send
us advertisers
some stuff that...

07:52.414 --> 07:54.382
well, you'll see it
nowhere else.

07:54.416 --> 07:55.883
I could take a look.

07:55.918 --> 07:57.886
Hank, remember
what we’re here for.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.717
But this is
private bloopers.

07:59.755 --> 08:01.416
Hey, do you have
the snowman

08:01.457 --> 08:03.755
who caught fire at
the Viking's game?

08:03.792 --> 08:04.759
Do I...

08:04.793 --> 08:07.284
I've got three different snowmen
catching fire.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.330
There he goes.

08:13.369 --> 08:14.495
How's it going?

08:14.536 --> 08:16.504
Did Blanca set you up all right?

08:16.538 --> 08:18.506
I would like
to talk about Luanne

08:18.540 --> 08:20.508
before we have to make
a blooper reel out of her life.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.841
Well, we just want
to make sure

08:23.879 --> 08:27.042
Luanne isn't getting
into any trouble.

08:27.082 --> 08:29.073
She is our only niece.

08:29.118 --> 08:32.349
Hank, Luanne is lucky
to have somebody like you

08:32.388 --> 08:35.323
looking out for her.

08:35.357 --> 08:37.256
Will you look at that.

08:37.292 --> 08:39.953
LARSEN:
Yeah, that's the J-5.

08:39.995 --> 08:41.962
It's a little project
I've been working on

08:41.996 --> 08:42.964
for quite some time now.

08:42.998 --> 08:45.796
In terms of
time-to-processing weight

08:45.834 --> 08:47.199
meat yield, weanability

08:47.236 --> 08:50.000
she's pretty much
the perfect pig.

08:50.039 --> 08:53.475
Mmm, looks like you
could eat it with
a spoon.

08:53.509 --> 08:55.477
Just give me five years
and you will.

08:55.511 --> 08:58.480
HANK:
Oh, just like a baby.

08:58.514 --> 09:00.539
Look at her, Peggy.

09:00.582 --> 09:04.780
Remind you of someone
when he was little?

09:04.820 --> 09:06.788
Hank, how would you
like to ride

09:06.822 --> 09:08.289
in a hot air balloon?

09:08.323 --> 09:09.290
Hey, I don't have
to tell you

09:09.324 --> 09:10.586
it's powered by propane.

09:10.626 --> 09:12.856
Well, that's one
of the eight uses of propane

09:12.895 --> 09:15.159
I haven't experienced
first hand.

09:15.197 --> 09:16.789
Oh, dear Lord.

09:16.832 --> 09:20.165
Peggy, I feel like
Neil Armstrong up here!

09:20.202 --> 09:24.332
I can see everybody's gutters,
and they look great!

09:24.373 --> 09:27.103
Mrs. Hill, I'm a guy
who makes his own rules.

09:27.142 --> 09:28.837
You play by them...

09:28.877 --> 09:30.344
everybody wins.

09:30.379 --> 09:32.404
Try to call your own game...

09:32.448 --> 09:33.915
not so terrific.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.041
(grunts)

09:35.084 --> 09:36.813
Whoa!

09:36.852 --> 09:38.683
Well, let me tell you something

09:38.720 --> 09:41.518
you might be rich,
but all the money in the world

09:41.557 --> 09:44.424
cannot buy you
the most precious gift of all...

09:44.460 --> 09:45.950
my respect.

09:45.994 --> 09:48.724
PEGGY:
The man willfully
endangered your life

09:48.764 --> 09:50.231
just to make
a point, Hank.

09:50.265 --> 09:51.926
Try to see it
from his point of view.

09:51.967 --> 09:54.162
He was trying to control
the balloon

09:54.203 --> 09:55.636
and you kept talking to him.

09:55.671 --> 09:56.831
I was right there.

09:56.872 --> 09:58.840
He was pulling and yanking
that cord

09:58.874 --> 10:00.603
and trying to jerk you
out of there

10:00.642 --> 10:03.042
with every last fiber
of his being, and then some.

10:03.078 --> 10:07.572
Aunt Peggy, Trip believes that
no one ever solved anything

10:07.616 --> 10:09.413
with a run-on sentence.

10:09.451 --> 10:11.851
What?
How dare you!

10:11.887 --> 10:14.185
You do not come into my house
and correct my grammar

10:14.223 --> 10:18.717
unless your name
happens to be
Strunk or White.

10:18.760 --> 10:19.385
Is it?

10:19.428 --> 10:20.622
I'm just trying
to help you

10:20.662 --> 10:27.192
improve yourself,
Aunt Peggy.

10:27.236 --> 10:32.139
(screams)

10:32.174 --> 10:34.699
Mmm, this'll cook
up nice, Hank.

10:34.743 --> 10:36.210
How much did it
cost you, huh?

10:36.245 --> 10:38.270
A hundred bucks?

10:38.313 --> 10:40.304
Hank, the man is crazy.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.715
That headless pig
is a threat.

10:42.751 --> 10:44.878
No, it's a gift

10:44.920 --> 10:48.014
from Trip Larsen,
and it's to you.

10:48.056 --> 10:50.991
I guess somebody
owes Trip an apology.

10:51.026 --> 10:54.154
There is a large,
dead animal on my lawn!

10:54.196 --> 10:56.892
Look, let's be reasonable
about this.

10:56.932 --> 11:00.095
I work in propane,
so I give away propane.

11:00.135 --> 11:02.729
Trip Larsen
works with pork

11:02.771 --> 11:04.739
so that's why he gave us
this fella here.

11:04.773 --> 11:06.035
Oh!

11:06.074 --> 11:07.405
(ells)

11:07.442 --> 11:09.774
No! You're bruising
the rinds!

11:09.811 --> 11:12.939
PEGGY:
That's it!

11:12.981 --> 11:16.246
Luanne, I have decided
that your boyfriend is crazy.

11:16.285 --> 11:18.253
Now, do you want
to break up with him

11:18.287 --> 11:19.254
or should I?

11:19.288 --> 11:20.255
Now, just stop it!

11:20.289 --> 11:21.256
Stop telling me what to do!

11:21.290 --> 11:24.623
I am a proud, ignorant woman

11:24.660 --> 11:27.128
and no one
is going to change that!

11:27.162 --> 11:30.427
Now that is the stupidest thing
I ever heard anyone say.

11:33.068 --> 11:38.267
(crying)

11:38.307 --> 11:42.107
You wiped your
eyes on my tie.

11:42.144 --> 11:43.111
That's okay.

11:43.145 --> 11:44.669
It's an
amazing fabric.

11:44.713 --> 11:45.702
Thanks, Trip.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.237
I feel better.

11:47.282 --> 11:50.342
I'm going to go home now

11:50.385 --> 11:56.051
and think of something mean
to do to Aunt Peggy, okay?

11:56.091 --> 11:58.286
Luanne, you are home.

11:58.327 --> 12:00.295
I took the liberty of having
your belongings

12:00.329 --> 12:01.296
meat-trucked out here.

12:01.330 --> 12:03.821
Forgive me if they
smell delicious.

12:19.214 --> 12:21.182
Luanne, dear,
this will
be your room.

12:21.216 --> 12:27.644
It's so beautiful.

12:27.689 --> 12:31.591
Oh, I don't see
any of my clothes.

12:31.627 --> 12:34.027
That's because
I had them shredded.

12:34.062 --> 12:35.029
Plant mulch.

12:35.063 --> 12:36.030
Gardening tip:

12:36.064 --> 12:38.225
Synthetics make
wonderful ground cover.

12:38.267 --> 12:45.230
But... but, see, I need stuff
to wear to dinner.

12:45.274 --> 12:47.538
Not a problem.

12:47.576 --> 12:53.412
But they're all the same.

12:53.448 --> 12:54.779
Nothing is
exactly the same.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.944
Everything has
a small flaw
or imperfection.

12:57.986 --> 13:03.788
It drives me mad.

13:08.063 --> 13:09.792
(scraping)

13:09.831 --> 13:11.264
Trip?

13:11.300 --> 13:16.363
Trip, is... is that you?

13:16.405 --> 13:17.531
(scraping)

13:17.572 --> 13:20.507
Trip, are you there?

13:20.542 --> 13:27.914
(scraping)

13:27.949 --> 13:30.543
(pained moaning)

13:30.585 --> 13:32.780
(screams)

13:32.821 --> 13:34.220
(grunting)

13:34.256 --> 13:35.348
(oinking)

13:35.390 --> 13:36.414
Back!
(crying)

13:36.458 --> 13:37.322
Back off, girl.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.587
Don't be messing
with Papa's lady

13:38.627 --> 13:39.924
now, you hear?

13:39.961 --> 13:41.428
Are you all right,
dearest?

13:41.463 --> 13:43.158
Why is there
a pig in the house?

13:43.198 --> 13:45.462
Oh, don’t tell me
you’re jealous.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.831
I might have grown up poor

13:46.868 --> 13:50.463
but I never knew anyone
who kept a pig in the house.

13:50.505 --> 13:53.406
Well, that's because
they weren't equipped for it.

13:53.442 --> 13:55.410
The floor in there
is Brazilian rosewood...

13:55.444 --> 13:57.810
super hard, super
high-quality stuff.

13:57.846 --> 13:59.006
And I had it finished

13:59.047 --> 14:01.015
with four coats
of polyurethane-

14:01.049 --> 14:02.016
not that it needs it.

14:02.050 --> 14:04.041
The J-5's hooves
are soft as
bedroom slippers.

14:04.086 --> 14:05.576
Schweigen!
(oinking)

14:05.620 --> 14:07.520
Go back to bed,
honey.

14:07.556 --> 14:08.682
I'll have Blanca
bring you up

14:08.724 --> 14:11.716
a warm glass
of milk, okay? Okay.

14:11.760 --> 14:20.964
Finish it all.

14:22.337 --> 14:25.932
(screaming)

14:25.974 --> 14:28.499
Oh, good. You're up.

14:28.543 --> 14:30.374
My... my head is bleeding.

14:30.412 --> 14:32.175
Your head hasn't been harmed.

14:32.214 --> 14:33.704
It's been improved.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.080
I took the liberty of dying it

14:35.117 --> 14:37.142
while you were asleep
these last 14 hours.

14:37.185 --> 14:38.652
But... well, why?

14:38.687 --> 14:40.518
I don't
want red hair.

14:40.555 --> 14:42.284
You don't like it? Okay.

14:42.324 --> 14:44.622
Well,
we can always shave it off

14:44.659 --> 14:46.126
and wait for it to regrow.

14:46.161 --> 14:46.991
No!

14:47.028 --> 14:50.327
Good. Then it's settled.

14:55.003 --> 14:59.201
Blanca, um... I'm going
all the way downstairs

14:59.241 --> 15:05.441
to practice my harp
like Mr. Larsen wanted me to.

15:19.428 --> 15:21.362
(gasps)

15:21.396 --> 15:22.556
It's me.

15:22.697 --> 15:24.722
Except for the teeth.

15:24.766 --> 15:25.824
But that can be taken care of.

15:25.867 --> 15:27.129
Are you trying

15:27.169 --> 15:28.966
to turn me into her?

15:29.004 --> 15:31.666
This is the Larsen
Pork Products Girl

15:31.706 --> 15:34.607
my grandfather
created 50 years ago.

15:34.643 --> 15:37.771
Her picture graced the walls
in my nursery.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.838
Mother never really
paid me much attention

15:39.881 --> 15:42.406
but she was always there.

15:42.451 --> 15:44.419
I'm very sorry about your mother

15:44.453 --> 15:46.045
and now I'm going home.

15:46.087 --> 15:47.179
Please don't go.

15:47.222 --> 15:49.918
I spent so many years
trying to find you.

15:49.958 --> 15:50.925
Look at her.

15:50.959 --> 15:53.689
The Larsen
Pork Products Woman

15:53.728 --> 15:55.696
is as comfortable
dining with kings

15:55.730 --> 15:56.697
as she is slaughtering pigs.

15:56.731 --> 16:01.065
I never thought I'd meet someone
as perfect as the woman

16:01.102 --> 16:02.364
in that picture.

16:02.404 --> 16:04.531
And then I saw you.

16:04.573 --> 16:06.268
At the Learning Annex.

16:06.308 --> 16:07.275
I guess.

16:07.309 --> 16:08.901
I'm just so alone here.

16:08.944 --> 16:11.344
I get scared.

16:11.379 --> 16:13.006
I understand.

16:13.048 --> 16:15.141
And I mean
to fix all that

16:15.183 --> 16:16.650
with a big
Halloween party

16:16.685 --> 16:18.653
to show the world
just how happy we are.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.416
Can I dress up
as a pirate?

16:20.455 --> 16:21.422
A woman as a pirate?

16:21.456 --> 16:23.424
Well, Zarathustra.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.186
I know just
what you’ll wear.

16:26.228 --> 16:27.195
This.

16:27.229 --> 16:32.064
Hey, it's an invitation.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.533
"Larsen Pork Products

16:33.568 --> 16:35.092
"and the Dance Theater
of Arlen

16:35.136 --> 16:38.731
invite you
to a Halloween Gala."

16:38.773 --> 16:40.104
Sounds like a blast.

16:40.141 --> 16:42.609
Well, I know Luanne
doesn’t want to see me

16:42.644 --> 16:44.805
but I am
a Silver Slipper donor

16:44.846 --> 16:46.074
to the Dance Theater of Arlen

16:46.114 --> 16:48.082
and those people
still owe me an umbrella.

16:48.116 --> 16:54.077
Oh, great. It's Luanne.

16:56.591 --> 16:58.957
I'll bet she can tell
us where the bathroom is.

16:58.994 --> 17:01.656
Is that all you care about...
the bathroom?

17:01.696 --> 17:02.924
What about Luanne?

17:02.964 --> 17:04.488
I can't enjoy a party

17:04.532 --> 17:06.501
until I know
where the bathroom is.

17:06.535 --> 17:08.502
You knew that
when you married me.

17:08.537 --> 17:11.300
Hi, Aunt Peggy.

17:11.339 --> 17:13.034
Uncle Hank.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.008
I'm really glad you could come.

17:15.042 --> 17:16.101
You look nice, Luanne.

17:16.144 --> 17:18.374
I know.
Trip told me.

17:18.413 --> 17:21.075
I'm the Larsen
Pork Products Girl.

17:21.116 --> 17:22.413
Oh, you see, Peggy?

17:22.450 --> 17:24.849
I could have come
as a Strickland Propane guy

17:24.886 --> 17:27.513
instead of renting
this getup.

17:27.556 --> 17:29.490
Mister is ready
for you now.

17:29.524 --> 17:36.623
Oh. This is Blanca.

17:36.665 --> 17:42.626
She's my best
friend here.

17:45.574 --> 17:47.303
Trip?

17:47.342 --> 17:49.105
Trip?

17:49.144 --> 17:54.446
I'm here, dearest.

17:54.482 --> 17:58.475
Luanne, you've never
looked more beautiful.

17:58.520 --> 18:00.249
And I've never
felt more alive.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.256
I never thought
this day would come

18:02.290 --> 18:03.257
when I would
have everything

18:03.291 --> 18:06.658
I've ever wanted
within my grasp.

18:06.695 --> 18:07.821
(gasps)

18:07.862 --> 18:10.763
Is that an
engagement ring?

18:10.799 --> 18:13.529
Wait, Luanne.
I want everything to be perfect.

18:13.568 --> 18:16.628
Luanne, will you
do me the great honor

18:16.671 --> 18:18.332
of marrying... him.

18:18.373 --> 18:21.240
Him?

18:21.276 --> 18:23.904
Javier, the time has come.

18:23.945 --> 18:26.971
That's the man in the ad!

18:27.015 --> 18:29.210
Life is a series of compromises.

18:29.250 --> 18:32.048
Trip, I'm kind of confused.

18:32.087 --> 18:34.715
What is happening here?

18:34.756 --> 18:35.723
Don't you see?

18:35.757 --> 18:36.724
We can have it all.

18:36.758 --> 18:38.726
We can be the family
in the picture.

18:38.760 --> 18:44.494
You, him and me.

18:44.532 --> 18:46.898
(oinking)

18:46.935 --> 18:50.530
What? What?

18:50.572 --> 18:54.133
(snorting)

18:54.175 --> 18:56.541
(screaming)

18:56.578 --> 18:58.944
Luanne, wait!

18:58.980 --> 19:00.379
Luanne!

19:00.415 --> 19:01.382
Where did Luanne go?

19:01.416 --> 19:03.543
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

19:03.585 --> 19:05.052
And me
to find out, too

19:05.086 --> 19:08.681
because I don't know.

19:08.723 --> 19:11.783
Luanne!

19:33.515 --> 19:36.382
(screaming)

19:36.418 --> 19:37.407
Luanne, wait.

19:37.452 --> 19:38.942
I can explain everything.

19:38.987 --> 19:41.319
No! You're sick.

19:41.356 --> 19:43.256
I'm calling the police.

19:43.291 --> 19:50.288
Luanne,
you're not thinking clearly.

19:52.133 --> 19:53.122
I'm here, Luanne!

19:53.168 --> 19:57.366
I'll take care of everything.

19:57.405 --> 20:03.776
(screaming)

20:03.812 --> 20:07.839
Oops.

20:09.651 --> 20:11.141
This is perfect!

20:11.186 --> 20:13.154
Now we can become
Larsen Pork Products

20:13.188 --> 20:15.816
together.

20:15.857 --> 20:17.722
(screaming)

20:17.759 --> 20:18.851
Luanne, trust me.

20:18.893 --> 20:20.383
This is for the best.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.020
We agreed that I
would do the thinking

20:22.063 --> 20:23.325
for both of us.

20:23.364 --> 20:28.961
I never agreed to be
a Larsen Pork product.

20:29.003 --> 20:30.265
Luanne, I thought

20:30.305 --> 20:32.000
you loved me!

20:32.040 --> 20:37.740
No. Trip!

20:40.582 --> 20:43.016
TRIP:
Pull the left lever! Now!

20:43.051 --> 20:45.042
Let me do it.

20:45.086 --> 20:48.988
(Trip laughing maniacal)

20:49.023 --> 20:50.854
(laughing)

20:50.892 --> 20:54.794
Mama, Papa, I'm coming home.

20:59.134 --> 21:01.830
Oh, my God.

21:01.870 --> 21:04.202
I can suddenly think clearly.

21:04.239 --> 21:06.400
The voices have left my head.

21:06.441 --> 21:10.377
What am I doing
in a pig costume?

21:10.411 --> 21:11.378
Uh-oh.

21:11.412 --> 21:16.372
(screaming)

21:16.417 --> 21:17.406
Well...

21:17.452 --> 21:19.079
at least Trip seemed happy.

21:19.120 --> 21:22.317
And now he's in a better place.

21:22.357 --> 21:24.325
Honey, Trip had
a mental breakdown

21:24.359 --> 21:25.758
and is now a sausage.

21:25.794 --> 21:28.024
That's not
a better place.

21:28.062 --> 21:30.189
But you handled the
situation very well.

21:30.231 --> 21:32.222
I did, didn't I?

21:32.267 --> 21:33.256
You saved yourself

21:33.301 --> 21:34.700
by thinking
for yourself.

21:34.736 --> 21:36.897
I did, didn't I?

21:36.938 --> 21:39.668
You are your own woman.

21:39.707 --> 21:41.641
I am. I am!
