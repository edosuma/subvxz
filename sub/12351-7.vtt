WEBVTT

00:02.025 --> 00:04.102
Just putting some of these things
in storage.

00:04.185 --> 00:06.213
Until me and God work
some of our issues out.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.340
You talked to Cappie?
What about?

00:08.508 --> 00:09.196
You.

00:10.023 --> 00:12.177
We're looking for a new usher,
if you know of anyone.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.428
I know a guy.

00:14.242 --> 00:15.209
Hey, I'm Lana.

00:15.292 --> 00:17.362
- How do you two know each other?
- Fight club.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.484
Well, before Nate left,
he told me that

00:20.567 --> 00:23.538
you and some guy in an Iron Man Audi

00:23.621 --> 00:25.023
told him to stay away from me.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.567
Evan has an Iron Man Audi.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.312
I'd rather hang out with Iron Man.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.435
- She offered me an internship.
- In new york.

00:30.518 --> 00:32.072
I can't believe that you're going.

00:32.873 --> 00:35.129
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I'm sorry too.

00:38.426 --> 00:40.637
"What are you wearing, Lord Doom?"

00:44.119 --> 00:47.226
"My imperial cloak of darkest evil.

00:47.309 --> 00:48.690
Commando style.

00:49.584 --> 00:50.565
And you?"

00:54.126 --> 00:57.149
So that's when I said,
"Polymer? I barely know her."

00:59.095 --> 00:59.896
Good one.

00:59.979 --> 01:02.019
Rusty and... Jordan?

01:06.286 --> 01:08.863
For a second I thought Jordan realized
what a horrible mistake

01:08.946 --> 01:11.195
- she made quitting school...
- Is that Dale?

01:13.698 --> 01:15.304
- I thought you broke up.
- We did.

01:15.387 --> 01:16.668
We're just catching up.

01:18.503 --> 01:19.893
Isn't technology great?

01:19.976 --> 01:21.909
I, myself, may have actually

01:21.992 --> 01:25.462
started a little cyberliaison
dangereuse of my own.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.836
It was getting NC-17 in there.

01:30.361 --> 01:32.661
You know, as an atheistic
former virgin,

01:32.744 --> 01:34.885
I'm free to pursue
every urge and desire.

01:35.371 --> 01:38.059
It's practically expected of me
to be loose with my morals

01:38.142 --> 01:39.119
and my genitals.

01:39.202 --> 01:40.989
Can you please not talk
about your genitals

01:41.072 --> 01:42.789
in front of my girlfr... My friend.

01:43.629 --> 01:45.266
You know. It's OK.
I have to run,

01:45.525 --> 01:46.980
go get lunch with people.

01:47.446 --> 01:48.412
Bye, Jordan.

01:48.495 --> 01:49.348
People?

01:49.726 --> 01:51.678
- Who?
- Some people I met in my building.

01:51.761 --> 01:54.585
You've been there a week and you
already made friends? That's great.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.617
Yeah, they're so much fun. Marci is a
film student. She's super creative.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.995
And Kelly is an intern at a PR firm.
And there's Eric.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.847
And Kelly's roommate Jane
is in urban planning.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.579
- She's hilarious.
- That's great.

02:07.873 --> 02:08.860
So Eric...

02:10.058 --> 02:12.616
Is he like, the fun gay guy
in the group?

02:13.041 --> 02:14.258
No, Eric's straight.

02:17.033 --> 02:19.263
Is this weird?
Do you not want to hear about this?

02:19.431 --> 02:22.844
No, it's fine. It's not like
this is a long-distance relationship.

02:23.149 --> 02:25.644
I said that wouldn't work
and you agreed.

02:27.950 --> 02:30.473
So do you wanna do this again,
like next week?

02:31.773 --> 02:32.578
Sure.

02:33.662 --> 02:34.982
Next week's great.

02:36.241 --> 02:37.408
It's great, yeah.

02:38.624 --> 02:39.491
OK, bye.

02:43.013 --> 02:44.934
Sounds like somebody's having
a good time.

02:46.035 --> 02:47.351
Speaking of a good time,

02:47.919 --> 02:49.419
vampira69 awaits.

02:53.031 --> 02:56.266
The coffee dates have been great.
I think we're in a good place now.

02:56.349 --> 02:58.593
That's exciting!
So Fisher's officially off probation?

02:58.761 --> 03:02.366
Once again, he is a full citizen
of the united states of Ashleigh!

03:02.864 --> 03:05.495
It's like the whole kissing
Rebecca thing never even happened.

03:05.578 --> 03:07.921
I'm happy for you guys,
it's so great when...

03:08.004 --> 03:09.667
There he is!
Get down! Get down!

03:09.750 --> 03:10.523
What?

03:12.218 --> 03:13.522
Is that Cappie with him?

03:15.497 --> 03:17.215
That's Sam from Theta Pi.

03:17.964 --> 03:20.157
Can we please take a break
from our daily stalking?

03:20.325 --> 03:23.076
- Staking-out.
- Stalking of Cappie and Evan.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.745
Why do you care so much anyway?

03:24.913 --> 03:26.816
How could I not?
It's Cappie and Evan.

03:26.899 --> 03:30.292
If they're hanging out and protecting me
from Nate types, I want to know.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.535
Do you think
they could be friends again?

03:32.874 --> 03:36.256
Well, if they are,
why did Cappie say that Nate was wrong?

03:36.424 --> 03:37.835
Why all the secrecy?

03:38.173 --> 03:39.838
That's what I'm trying to find out.

03:40.470 --> 03:43.292
Wait, where did Evan go?
We're on the move! Let's go!

03:44.219 --> 03:46.058
Do you even take classes
here anymore?

04:01.788 --> 04:04.951
Are you heading out
with cleaning supplies?

04:06.293 --> 04:08.789
I'm staying in.
Getting a jump on spring cleaning.

04:09.419 --> 04:11.620
- Isn't that what pledges are for?
- It is, yes.

04:11.703 --> 04:12.914
But we...

04:13.601 --> 04:15.962
We're teaching by example.
You know what they say:

04:16.130 --> 04:17.882
"Cleanliness is next to godliness."

04:17.966 --> 04:20.050
And you don't want to piss off God!

04:22.894 --> 04:23.848
Anyway,

04:24.195 --> 04:26.103
I've been thinking lately.

04:26.186 --> 04:27.070
A lot.

04:27.524 --> 04:30.528
- Do you remember dry weekend?
- Barely, yeah.

04:30.611 --> 04:32.521
Did we really eat cheesaritos
and whipped cream?

04:32.689 --> 04:33.688
We sure did.

04:34.377 --> 04:37.067
Do you remember how you said
that you and Cappie talked about me?

04:40.594 --> 04:42.074
Case, like I said before,

04:43.207 --> 04:45.242
- I didn't mean to mess you guys up.
- I know.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.285
I'm just wondering
how it all happened.

04:47.453 --> 04:50.272
I mean, did he approach you?
Did you approach him?

04:52.953 --> 04:54.191
I hope you're not

04:54.274 --> 04:58.004
over-analyzing this whole thing 'cause,
God, I wish I hadn't said anything.

04:58.172 --> 05:01.787
It just seems like an awfully
personal conversation to have

05:01.870 --> 05:03.627
between two guys
who hate each other.

05:07.351 --> 05:09.812
Cappie and I were really drunk.
You know how booze works.

05:09.895 --> 05:12.579
One minute you're fighting,
the next minute you're best friends.

05:12.662 --> 05:15.689
The minute after that you're puking
and then back to fighting again.

05:16.435 --> 05:18.269
- And that's it?
- And that's it.

05:19.073 --> 05:20.026
Sorry, Case.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.829
I need to show these pledges
how to use a broom, so...

05:34.388 --> 05:35.422
Happy sweeping.

05:41.416 --> 05:43.091
She already has friends in New York?

05:43.259 --> 05:45.002
What, do they sit
around Central Perk

05:45.196 --> 05:47.179
and talk about
what to name Rachel's baby?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.557
Stop torturing yourself.
You're the one that ended it

05:49.640 --> 05:51.709
- because of the long-distance thing.
- I know.

05:52.339 --> 05:53.692
It was the right decision.

05:54.164 --> 05:56.540
Yeah, well, maybe you should
stop talking for a while.

05:56.895 --> 05:59.465
I mean, you're just making it harder
for yourself to move on.

05:59.899 --> 06:02.736
Any relationship
over a computer is not real.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.154
Tell that to Lord Doom.

06:04.904 --> 06:08.667
My virtual relationship
with vampira69 is real.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.368
No relationship is perfect!

06:10.536 --> 06:11.878
Look at you and Grant.

06:12.585 --> 06:15.285
- Why? Because we're gay?
- No, not at all.

06:15.368 --> 06:17.231
I'm an atheist now, I say,

06:17.831 --> 06:19.044
Do 'em if you got 'em.

06:19.334 --> 06:21.713
I meant the sneaking around.
That's not exactly ideal.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.380
I don't really like it, but

06:23.463 --> 06:25.719
at least we took our relationship
to the next level,

06:25.802 --> 06:27.091
if you know what I mean.

06:29.128 --> 06:30.466
Do 'em if you got 'em.

06:31.072 --> 06:33.729
How about you both get out there
and meet some real live girls?

06:34.301 --> 06:35.435
Let's go out tonight.

06:35.871 --> 06:38.855
I guess it is my duty
to bump uglies in RL Now.

06:39.023 --> 06:42.045
- That's "have sex in real life."
- I got it. Thanks.

06:43.264 --> 06:44.194
C'mon, Rusty.

06:44.357 --> 06:46.863
Yeah, let's drop it like it's hot
with some shawties.

06:47.290 --> 06:48.822
All right. Let's do it.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.118
When did you become T-Pain?

06:52.586 --> 06:54.410
I'm going through a lot of changes.

06:55.580 --> 06:58.448
So... What do you wanna do
tonight, boyfriend?

07:00.042 --> 07:03.021
Well, I don't know,
what do you want to do, girlfriend?

07:04.575 --> 07:05.412
That...

07:05.787 --> 07:08.402
- sounded weird, didn't it?
- Yeah, it did a little bit.

07:09.512 --> 07:13.352
It has to be something awesome for our
first date as a back-together couple.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.253
How about the Ohio River Comic-Con,
in Cincinnati?

07:20.180 --> 07:22.732
- Yeah, that sounds like fun.
- I was kidding.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.182
Comic books and Cincinnati?

07:27.363 --> 07:28.372
We could...

07:29.395 --> 07:30.462
Go ice skating?

07:30.917 --> 07:33.968
We could, but I just went
with some of the sisters last week.

07:34.433 --> 07:36.122
- Right. Yeah, I knew that.
- Yeah.

07:37.915 --> 07:38.939
Oh, my God.

07:39.217 --> 07:42.168
Clueless is playing at the Titan.
I've never seen it in a theater!

07:43.063 --> 07:46.256
- You hate that idea.
- No. No, I've actually never seen it.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.979
You've never seen Clueless?
And you're a film major?

07:49.326 --> 07:51.303
I thought CRU had a good program.

07:52.037 --> 07:53.050
You're right.

07:53.575 --> 07:54.848
We should go. Let's go.

07:55.788 --> 07:58.518
Great. So should I just meet you
at the theater?

07:58.686 --> 08:02.198
Or I could pick you up here.
That's what we used to do before, right?

08:02.676 --> 08:03.479
Right.

08:04.869 --> 08:06.500
Just like it used to be.

08:11.678 --> 08:12.965
We might have a problem.

08:13.048 --> 08:14.933
I know, you missed a spot,
Chambers-maid.

08:15.378 --> 08:17.392
We can't pay our respects
tomorrow night

08:17.475 --> 08:20.938
to the cremated remains of the
original amphoras in a dirty lair.

08:21.021 --> 08:23.084
No, no, I'm talking about Casey.

08:23.167 --> 08:25.280
I think she's on
to our secret friendship.

08:26.627 --> 08:28.100
- She talked to you, too?
- Yeah.

08:28.183 --> 08:30.842
- She tried that on me at Dobler's.
- So, what should we do?

08:33.356 --> 08:36.131
Do you think we should just tell her
things are different between us?

08:36.215 --> 08:37.386
Down here they are.

08:37.775 --> 08:40.143
Down here?
"Down here it's our time."

08:41.001 --> 08:43.275
Goonies, nice.
That line holds up.

08:43.698 --> 08:46.152
I can see myself
in your 200-year-old walnut.

08:47.493 --> 08:51.135
You know what they say:
"cleanliness is next to godliness."

08:51.218 --> 08:52.821
And you don't wanna piss off God.

08:54.726 --> 08:55.907
It was a joke?

08:55.990 --> 08:58.404
Yes, I took a well-known phrase
and I spun it...

08:58.487 --> 09:00.438
Explaining it doesn't make it
any funnier.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.544
Anyways, these amphoras seem to take
this whole secret society thing

09:05.627 --> 09:06.884
really seriously.

09:07.827 --> 09:09.995
- They will kick us out.
- Rules are rules. Right?

09:10.078 --> 09:12.813
We just keep denying.
Casey'll have to give up eventually.

09:18.123 --> 09:20.141
It's a text from our mutual friend.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.893
"Evan told me everything.

09:22.446 --> 09:24.463
Meet me at the stairs
at eight to discuss."

09:25.447 --> 09:26.981
She'll give up eventually?

09:27.149 --> 09:29.298
Pesky times call for pesky measures.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.534
- I'm so ready.
- We're gonna tear it up!

09:43.951 --> 09:46.793
Check it out. Streetwalker fishnets,
at your nine o'clock.

09:47.752 --> 09:49.390
I thought I felt some hungry eyes.

09:56.656 --> 09:58.429
It's just 'cause I'm gay. Trust me,

09:58.512 --> 10:01.015
gay guys go over bigger
than glow sticks in the club world.

10:01.762 --> 10:04.153
No offense, r-man, I think
you're cramping my style.

10:04.278 --> 10:06.346
- I'm gonna go in, OK?
- Excuse me, fellas.

10:06.471 --> 10:07.906
Get out of here.

10:11.647 --> 10:13.990
I don't know about this, calvin...

10:17.770 --> 10:20.290
Your friend over there
said I should come say hi.

10:20.985 --> 10:22.659
He's my gay friend.

10:22.784 --> 10:24.667
I'm not gay, though.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.916
I love girls. And I can
prove it to you.

10:27.341 --> 10:29.210
No, thank you.

10:44.159 --> 10:45.276
Impressive.

10:45.757 --> 10:47.196
So I guess you got my text?

10:47.660 --> 10:49.324
You can't tell anybody.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.485
I knew it!
Why all the secrecy?

10:51.610 --> 10:53.547
If our enemies find out
that me and evan are

10:53.672 --> 10:55.559
vigilante crime fighters
who protect the people

10:55.684 --> 10:58.208
of cyprus from the dark forces
of evil and corruption,

10:58.333 --> 11:00.122
we'll be so screwed.

11:00.664 --> 11:01.836
You're messing with me.

11:03.045 --> 11:04.369
There's my partner now.

11:04.648 --> 11:06.551
Reclusive boy billionaire
evan chambers.

11:10.187 --> 11:11.555
He's so good at pretending

11:11.680 --> 11:13.728
he's mad at me, I almost
believe it myself.

11:14.623 --> 11:17.346
Tell casey that we're
a stealth crime fighting team.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.677
Wha...

11:19.210 --> 11:20.978
- That is hilarious.
- Really.

11:21.436 --> 11:23.406
- Did you put him up to this?
- OK, I get it.

11:23.531 --> 11:25.432
Come on, she knows.

11:25.802 --> 11:28.609
Let's use that. She could be the
gwyneth to our robert downey!

11:28.734 --> 11:31.201
The michael caine slash morgan
freeman slash katie holmes

11:31.326 --> 11:33.305
slash maggie gyllenhaal
to our christian bale.

11:33.430 --> 11:35.701
- You can stop now.
- Yeah, get out of my way, crappie.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.365
Guys, come on!

11:42.073 --> 11:43.518
Oh, my gosh!

11:44.870 --> 11:46.138
Guys...

11:48.511 --> 11:50.011
Guys!

12:13.433 --> 12:15.274
Come on, guys!

12:18.738 --> 12:20.045
Stop!

12:25.861 --> 12:27.394
So, what'd you think?

12:28.947 --> 12:31.657
Are you kidding?
What'd you think?

12:32.980 --> 12:34.460
I'm just gonna say it.

12:35.150 --> 12:37.175
I think cluelessis one
of the greatest movies

12:37.300 --> 12:38.958
in the history of movies.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.476
That's is what I was thinking.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.969
- Really?
- Yeah, absolutely.

12:44.094 --> 12:47.082
The music and the clothes

12:47.434 --> 12:50.978
and the Make-overs,
come on, it's a classic.

12:52.346 --> 12:53.703
I have the greatest idea.

12:53.828 --> 12:55.485
You should show it
at your film club.

12:55.610 --> 12:57.214
At my film club?

12:57.339 --> 12:59.601
Clueless, it's a great idea.

12:59.726 --> 13:02.454
Yeah, I could pitch it
at tomorrow night's screening.

13:02.579 --> 13:05.301
We're watching this old ingmar
bergman classic, wild strawberries.

13:05.426 --> 13:08.241
You should totally
come. Only if you want to.

13:10.281 --> 13:12.243
OK. No, I love old movies.

13:12.368 --> 13:14.444
I've seentootsie, twice.

13:14.816 --> 13:16.243
What do you wanna do for dinner?

13:16.368 --> 13:18.658
- I could go for some pizza.
- Anything but pizza.

13:19.660 --> 13:21.373
- Let's do pizza.
- Are you sure?

13:21.554 --> 13:24.183
- Absolutely. I love that idea.
- OK, me, too.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.910
So maybe electric rage
was the wrong step

13:29.035 --> 13:30.463
into the single world for you.

13:30.588 --> 13:32.276
I'm not so sure
there's a right step.

13:32.401 --> 13:35.638
Come on. We gotta keep getting you out
there and you'll be moving on

13:35.763 --> 13:37.665
from jordan before you know it.

13:38.672 --> 13:39.600
What was that?

13:39.907 --> 13:42.368
Vampira69 just told a twilight joke

13:42.493 --> 13:44.100
that would make your ears bleed.

13:44.225 --> 13:46.439
I thought it was
your duty to have sex.

13:46.657 --> 13:48.359
You can't have sex with a computer.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.487
- Not real sex, face-to-face.
- It's pronounced "f2f".

13:51.656 --> 13:53.322
And I know, but that's
about to change.

13:54.096 --> 13:56.522
Vampira69 just told me she
wants to meet in person tonight,

13:57.093 --> 14:00.141
at the, ohio river
comic-con in cincinnati!

14:01.306 --> 14:03.139
Tonight? Let's all go.

14:03.573 --> 14:06.084
Maybe the problem with the club
was it just wasn't your crowd.

14:06.349 --> 14:08.683
Dude, comic book conventions
are crawling with hotties.

14:08.808 --> 14:11.549
- Everybody knows that.
- Yeah. No, they don't.

14:11.718 --> 14:14.547
We're talking skin-tight
cat suits, man.

14:15.016 --> 14:16.514
Skin-tight.

14:20.001 --> 14:23.330
With great power,
comes great responsibility.

14:23.455 --> 14:24.755
See?

14:25.106 --> 14:27.437
Dork talk.
They are gonna love you.

14:28.192 --> 14:30.893
It was like
the most polite date ever.

14:31.018 --> 14:34.382
At one point, I thought fisher
and cover a puddle for me.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.076
Didn't you take him off probation?

14:36.201 --> 14:38.827
I did. So why does it feel so off?

14:39.129 --> 14:41.699
You guys will find
your rhythm. Don't worry.

14:41.824 --> 14:44.185
At least you weren't beating
the crap out of each other.

14:44.310 --> 14:46.795
Right, the big kt-omega chi brawl.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.197
Give me details.
I heard someone pulled a shiv.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.052
There was no shiv-pulling
or pushing.

14:52.383 --> 14:53.899
Wait, what's a shiv?

14:54.779 --> 14:57.563
Whatever. All my sleuthing made them
hate each other more.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.915
- I'm like the worst detective ever.
- Stop it.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.554
Remember inspector gadget?

15:01.679 --> 15:04.690
He needed a dog and a ten-year
old girl to solve anything.

15:05.079 --> 15:07.317
I just really wanted it to be true.

15:07.687 --> 15:09.890
Why? Is this about cappie?

15:10.015 --> 15:12.235
It's clear there are
still feelings there

15:12.404 --> 15:15.154
since every time you're around
him you turn into the female hugh grant.

15:15.279 --> 15:17.704
How I feel about cappie
is kind of irrelevant

15:17.829 --> 15:20.110
since he's off
with that fight club girl.

15:20.935 --> 15:23.446
- And what about evan?
- We're friends.

15:23.769 --> 15:26.313
And that's what I wanted all
of us to be, like freshman year.

15:26.584 --> 15:29.075
When evan and cappie and I
hung out together, it was...

15:29.200 --> 15:30.772
Everyone was happy.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.169
And my ugg boots
were still in style.

15:33.674 --> 15:35.066
It was a good time.

15:35.591 --> 15:37.952
Maybe someday you three
will get that back.

15:38.794 --> 15:42.248
Regardless, I owe them both
a wildly humiliating apology.

15:45.929 --> 15:48.467
There's a q&a via
satellite with q from star trek.

15:48.592 --> 15:50.556
Not bad, cincinnati.

15:50.681 --> 15:53.219
Is that the guy who reads the
bible to you before you go to bed?

15:53.344 --> 15:55.444
I'm excited for q. Not god.

15:57.167 --> 15:58.488
Are you nervous?

15:59.316 --> 16:01.275
I'm just going over
some opening lines

16:01.494 --> 16:03.659
so I'm ready when I meet somebody.

16:06.373 --> 16:07.795
Yeah, we're just on the road.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.771
I'm here with rusty and dale.

16:11.397 --> 16:12.856
Rusty say hi to grant.

16:18.285 --> 16:19.624
That's sweet.

16:19.939 --> 16:21.422
Yeah, I Miss you too.

16:47.533 --> 16:49.080
Are you going to comic-con?

16:49.367 --> 16:50.811
Yeah. Are you?

16:52.468 --> 16:54.495
Guess it's pretty obvious.

16:56.635 --> 16:58.257
Find me there, OK?

17:05.911 --> 17:08.663
Lord doom is ready for comic-con!

17:09.057 --> 17:11.848
Yeah! Comic-con, baby!

17:27.502 --> 17:29.411
Case, got your text.

17:29.908 --> 17:32.319
Just making sure there's
no omega chi waiting

17:32.444 --> 17:33.926
to ambush me this time.

17:34.051 --> 17:37.774
I think you're safe. I got you a
beer to make up for my meddling.

17:38.050 --> 17:41.758
In that case, that case
meddling forgiven.

17:42.773 --> 17:44.252
How're you feeling?

17:45.175 --> 17:47.180
Nothing a little
drinking won't heal.

17:48.062 --> 17:50.964
I can't believe that I thought
you and evan could be friends again.

17:51.311 --> 17:53.437
Yeah, a little bit of a
hair-brained scheme there.

17:53.801 --> 17:57.707
Me and chambers? Not gonna
happen. Way too much baggage.

17:59.778 --> 18:02.004
It would've been nice,
though, if I were right.

18:02.129 --> 18:03.629
Don't you Miss freshman year?

18:03.754 --> 18:06.408
The three of us, hanging out
in the dorm. It was fun.

18:06.581 --> 18:07.964
It was pretty fun.

18:09.980 --> 18:11.720
But, the past is the past.

18:11.845 --> 18:13.748
You can't change it,
and you can't go back.

18:13.918 --> 18:17.148
I guess so. You gotta keep
moving forward, right?

18:18.276 --> 18:20.230
How are things with lana?

18:22.990 --> 18:25.383
- Good. She's cool.
- She seems cool.

18:26.351 --> 18:28.161
I'm happy for you.

18:34.230 --> 18:36.272
- Thanks for the beer.
- You off?

18:36.441 --> 18:37.982
To sweep some chimneys?

18:38.394 --> 18:40.776
I was just doing a little
tidying up at the kt house.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.686
Cleaning? At kt?
Has that ever happened before?

18:44.106 --> 18:46.956
First time for everything.
You know what they say:

18:47.081 --> 18:48.947
"cleanliness is next
to cappie-ness."

18:49.072 --> 18:50.967
And you do not want
to piss off Cappie

18:51.092 --> 18:52.429
See ya.

18:56.325 --> 18:57.677
Oh, my god.

19:05.092 --> 19:07.002
- Nice.
- That's how it's done.

19:07.171 --> 19:09.128
Guys. Everyone decent?

19:10.226 --> 19:11.983
To what do we owe this...

19:12.108 --> 19:14.119
obscenely large fruit basket?

19:14.244 --> 19:16.527
We are delivering fruit baskets

19:16.652 --> 19:19.729
to every house on campus.
Just a little ZBZ good well

19:19.854 --> 19:22.231
for what seems like
the longest semester ever.

19:25.087 --> 19:27.481
- No cheesaritos?
- No. Sorry.

19:29.025 --> 19:30.788
- Enjoy!
- Thank you.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.541
Do we just play around it?

19:33.962 --> 19:35.770
Like putt-putt?

19:54.528 --> 19:56.426
I really can't believe you
talked me into this.

19:59.059 --> 20:01.451
What makes you think they're not
gonna look inside the basket?

20:01.599 --> 20:04.851
The only fruit the KTS
consume is used to flavor vodka.

20:05.411 --> 20:09.190
Can you believe I fell for that fight?
They must've told their houses to fake

20:09.315 --> 20:11.644
the fight to throw me off the scent.
Diabolical.

20:12.291 --> 20:13.978
You sucking suck-sucker!

20:14.244 --> 20:16.051
That seems a little
needlessly complicated.

20:16.176 --> 20:17.842
And a tad egotistical
on your part.

20:19.423 --> 20:22.239
Why are kittens called kittens?
They're little cats.

20:22.364 --> 20:23.694
Shouldn't they be called cattens?

20:24.177 --> 20:26.857
So this is what fraternity guys
talk about when no one's listening?

20:27.715 --> 20:29.808
Do you think Ashleigh was acting
a little strange?

20:30.726 --> 20:31.840
Whatever. She's hot.

20:32.307 --> 20:33.331
I'd do her.

20:34.497 --> 20:37.388
That reminds me, the other day this guy
at dobler's was telling me

20:37.513 --> 20:41.318
that 80 percent of college kids have sex
in any given year. Can you believe that?

20:41.619 --> 20:44.857
It's nothing compary the fact One out of
every two pregnancies in america

20:44.982 --> 20:45.896
are unplanned.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.557
What do you expect when half of
unmarried men who have sex

20:48.682 --> 20:49.962
never wear a condom.

20:50.293 --> 20:51.738
They know! They know! Get down!

20:51.863 --> 20:53.078
We just sounded fancy!

20:53.481 --> 20:54.781
your butt crack's showing.

20:55.725 --> 20:56.570
Never mind.

20:57.161 --> 20:58.041
I'm gonna go.

20:58.166 --> 21:00.172
Why don't you come with me
to fisher's film club?

21:00.297 --> 21:04.019
We're watching movie called
strawberries gone wild, or something.

21:04.144 --> 21:06.288
You go. I'm gonna stay here and
wait for cappie.

21:08.625 --> 21:09.423
Have fun.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.512
and good luck with your...
...crazy.

21:17.559 --> 21:21.512
ok, boys. Gotta run. I will meet you
later at dobler's.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.399
Later.

21:45.399 --> 21:46.276
Seventy-five bucks

21:46.277 --> 21:47.277
for spock ears?

21:47.901 --> 21:48.835
Nerd-sploitation

21:48.836 --> 21:49.836
is what that is.

21:50.086 --> 21:50.898
I don't think I've ever seen

21:50.899 --> 21:52.249
so many comic-obsessed fans

21:52.711 --> 21:53.711
in one place before.

21:54.027 --> 21:55.227
I just need to find one.

21:55.901 --> 21:56.901
Vampira69's waiting

21:57.774 --> 21:58.774
on lord doom.

21:59.024 --> 22:00.074
I've got no intention

22:00.336 --> 22:01.838
of disappointing a 500-year-old

22:01.839 --> 22:02.775
blood-sucking

22:02.776 --> 22:04.126
should we be concerned that

22:08.151 --> 22:09.650
dale's taking this super-villain

22:09.651 --> 22:11.101
thing a little too seriously?

22:11.587 --> 22:12.837
She's wearing green alien

22:13.088 --> 22:14.588
makeup. It can't be that hard.

22:18.902 --> 22:19.902
Oh, hey, wait,

22:20.213 --> 22:21.213
there she is!

22:24.087 --> 22:25.087
Excuse me.

22:26.963 --> 22:27.963
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.150
hey.

22:41.213 --> 22:41.962
- Leopard boy!

22:41.963 --> 22:42.837
- Leopard boy?

22:42.838 --> 22:43.776
It was my favorite

22:43.777 --> 22:44.777
tv show growing up.

22:45.214 --> 22:45.962
His mom is human

22:45.963 --> 22:47.213
but his dad is a leopard,

22:47.277 --> 22:48.149
and he solves these mysteries

22:48.150 --> 22:49.650
at this posh caribbean resort.

22:50.901 --> 22:51.964
They've gotta have a booth here.

22:51.965 --> 22:52.965
I'll be right back.

22:54.212 --> 22:55.212
Come on.

23:02.837 --> 23:03.937
We made first contact.

23:06.401 --> 23:07.088
- Wow! That was...

23:07.089 --> 23:08.639
- Amazing? Bergman is a genius!

23:09.775 --> 23:11.275
I know, the allusions to freud

23:11.527 --> 23:12.337
and german expressionism in

23:12.338 --> 23:13.652
the opening dream sequence,

23:13.653 --> 23:14.653
it was just awesome!

23:17.728 --> 23:18.336
What'd you think

23:18.337 --> 23:19.337
about it, ash?

23:19.839 --> 23:20.653
What did I think

23:20.654 --> 23:21.654
of the movie?

23:22.526 --> 23:23.337
Um, I thought

23:23.338 --> 23:24.338
it was very...

23:25.713 --> 23:26.713
Honestly, I was so

23:28.463 --> 23:29.401
bored for a minute I thought

23:29.402 --> 23:30.402
I couldn't breathe.

23:30.403 --> 23:31.338
How is that even possible?

23:31.339 --> 23:32.889
It's probably the greatest film

23:33.338 --> 23:34.338
in cinema history.

23:34.837 --> 23:35.837
I wouldn't say that.

23:35.966 --> 23:36.713
Right, fisher?

23:36.714 --> 23:37.401
Name one film

23:37.402 --> 23:38.502
that even comes close.

23:38.593 --> 23:39.593
Uh,clueless?

23:40.088 --> 23:41.088
- Is that godard?

23:41.526 --> 23:42.526
- Silverstone.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.089
- Is she kidding?

23:45.154 --> 23:46.274
- No. Fisher agrees with me.

23:46.275 --> 23:46.964
We think it's one of the

23:46.965 --> 23:48.265
greatest movies ever made.

23:48.404 --> 23:49.404
Right, fisher?

23:50.528 --> 23:51.878
Uh... Yeah, I thinkclueless

23:51.902 --> 23:52.776
is, uh... Colorful, with

23:52.777 --> 23:54.027
a really great... Spirit,

23:55.212 --> 23:56.212
and it has a very

23:56.966 --> 23:58.316
interesting use of montage.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.004
And it also evokes the, uh,

24:01.838 --> 24:02.838
nuance, of early

24:03.088 --> 24:04.088
screwball comedy.

24:04.528 --> 24:05.404
Hey, who wants pizza?

24:05.405 --> 24:06.405
I do!

24:12.028 --> 24:13.028
I'm meeting

24:13.089 --> 24:14.401
my internet girlfriend here.

24:14.402 --> 24:15.529
I mean, not really girlfriend.

24:15.530 --> 24:16.980
More like sex partner, but...

24:17.339 --> 24:18.339
...you know.

24:19.214 --> 24:20.664
How much are the sticky buns?

24:20.903 --> 24:21.903
Lord doom,

24:22.279 --> 24:23.479
are you ready to submit?

24:24.341 --> 24:25.691
Vampira69, we meet at last.

24:29.653 --> 24:30.653
Dale?

24:30.840 --> 24:32.090
Sheila! You're vampira69?

24:33.965 --> 24:34.965
Is this a joke?

24:35.091 --> 24:36.026
Did you know it was me?

24:36.027 --> 24:37.127
No, no, of course not!

24:37.967 --> 24:38.903
Although given

24:38.904 --> 24:40.204
the tawdry yet imaginative

24:40.401 --> 24:41.587
scenes of debauchery you typed,

24:41.588 --> 24:42.154
I suppose

24:42.155 --> 24:43.027
I should've guessed.

24:43.028 --> 24:43.777
Maybe there's a reason

24:43.778 --> 24:45.278
we were brought back together.

24:46.902 --> 24:47.714
Maybe it's all part

24:47.715 --> 24:48.715
of god's plan.

24:49.028 --> 24:49.901
I don't really believe

24:49.902 --> 24:51.052
in that anymore, but...

24:51.592 --> 24:52.792
And you hurt me, sheila.

24:53.589 --> 24:54.589
Sorry.

24:55.777 --> 24:56.403
Think you could find

24:56.404 --> 24:57.404
a way to forgive me?

24:58.590 --> 24:59.840
And if not me, vampira69?

25:04.235 --> 25:07.592
I still can't believe you found me.
There's a lot of green girls.

25:07.675 --> 25:10.098
I'd already introduced myself
to two aliens and a shrek.

25:11.966 --> 25:14.514
I'm Rusty Cartwright, by the way.

25:14.597 --> 25:15.664
Falitza.

25:16.055 --> 25:18.021
I'm a Borgton from the planet Lycon.

25:18.424 --> 25:19.834
My friends call me Sally.

25:20.826 --> 25:22.109
So where's Sally from?

25:22.358 --> 25:23.926
I assume not Lycon.

25:24.406 --> 25:26.032
You assume correctly, Rusty.

25:26.115 --> 25:27.490
I'm from Adamsburg.

25:27.821 --> 25:30.829
I go to school in Cyprus!
We're ten minutes away, that's great.

25:31.285 --> 25:33.653
My last relationship ended
because of long distance.

25:34.477 --> 25:37.078
You're not planning on moving
to New York anytime soon, are you?

25:37.161 --> 25:38.609
New York? No.

25:39.796 --> 25:41.313
That's not... No.

25:41.901 --> 25:42.981
Don't worry.

25:43.357 --> 25:45.777
I just mean, if this were to progress
into a relationship,

25:45.860 --> 25:48.153
it'll be easy for us
to sleep at each other's places.

25:49.822 --> 25:51.016
Do you have a car?

25:51.532 --> 25:52.363
Great.

25:52.784 --> 25:54.618
I don't. My sister does,

25:54.786 --> 25:56.473
but she hardly ever lets me use it.

25:56.996 --> 25:59.164
She's cool though.
You'll really like her.

26:00.375 --> 26:01.518
If you meet her.

26:03.645 --> 26:06.630
I'm not saying that...
you will meet my family.

26:08.466 --> 26:09.775
Oh, my God.

26:12.507 --> 26:14.638
Well, that was weird, wasn't it?

26:16.077 --> 26:17.092
Sort of.

26:18.442 --> 26:19.998
It was nice to meet you, Rusty.

26:20.595 --> 26:22.054
Have fun at Comic-Con.

26:35.887 --> 26:37.452
Did you walk into a door?

26:37.620 --> 26:39.906
Yeah, that really
got out of hand, right?

26:40.740 --> 26:43.503
- It worked on Casey, right?
- Yeah, I talked to her. Trust me,

26:43.586 --> 26:45.152
she doesn't suspect a thing.

26:45.607 --> 26:47.420
No more suspecting, that's for sure.

26:47.588 --> 26:50.715
I knew you were secret friends!
Oh, my god, I'm awesome!

26:50.883 --> 26:53.802
- How did you find this place?
- I followed Cappie from KT.

26:53.970 --> 26:56.892
What?
I used my super secret sneaky route.

26:56.975 --> 26:59.670
Yeah, and I almost puked three times

26:59.753 --> 27:01.476
in the sewer tunnels, but I made it!

27:01.644 --> 27:03.103
I've so many questions for you.

27:03.271 --> 27:05.272
How long have you been friends?
What is this place?

27:05.440 --> 27:07.101
- You need to hide!
- Casey, hide.

27:07.184 --> 27:08.567
Hide? From who?

27:08.735 --> 27:11.688
Quiet, incessant question girl! Hide now
and everything will be explained.

27:20.867 --> 27:22.925
- We should get started.
- Yeah!

27:23.630 --> 27:25.598
We're here tonight to pay homage

27:26.034 --> 27:27.625
to our amphora fore-fathers.

27:27.708 --> 27:28.475
Amphora.

27:28.558 --> 27:30.547
It's time to bring out the ashes

27:30.715 --> 27:32.746
of the original amphora members.

27:33.301 --> 27:35.264
Retrieve the burial urn.

27:38.931 --> 27:40.836
You don't... I think it...

27:44.937 --> 27:45.757
Who is she?

27:47.523 --> 27:48.299
I'm...

27:50.309 --> 27:51.914
You're Casey Cartwright?

27:52.604 --> 27:53.950
- He did it.
- He did it.

27:58.221 --> 28:01.036
Guys, you totally broke the trust!

28:01.204 --> 28:02.816
I can't believe this but

28:03.679 --> 28:06.941
- we're going to have to banish you.
- Brett, no, we can explain...

28:08.851 --> 28:10.764
Sorry. Fellow amphora brethren.

28:10.847 --> 28:13.398
Since you two obviously
can't handle a simple

28:13.481 --> 28:15.414
"secrecy until death" rule...

28:16.151 --> 28:19.328
Don't blame them.
It's not their fault.

28:19.717 --> 28:20.794
I'm just

28:21.222 --> 28:23.272
really clever when it comes
to investigating...

28:23.355 --> 28:24.267
Quiet!

28:24.435 --> 28:25.372
I have...

28:25.704 --> 28:27.298
no idea what to do with you.

28:27.381 --> 28:30.641
She's the first intruder
in the history of amphora.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.330
- Like I said, really clever.
- You should stop.

29:08.513 --> 29:09.754
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

29:13.490 --> 29:16.718
Certain ancient aboriginal tribes
would sacrifice

29:16.886 --> 29:19.595
those who intruded
on a holy plot of land.

29:21.763 --> 29:25.019
I don't think
it's come to that, but

29:25.505 --> 29:27.270
thank you.
Amphoras,

29:27.972 --> 29:29.731
minus the trust-breakers...

29:30.615 --> 29:31.828
Let's consult!

29:37.097 --> 29:40.158
So this is why you guys
were keeping it a secret.

29:40.326 --> 29:41.173
Exactly.

29:41.256 --> 29:43.457
Now you might get kicked out
because of me.

29:44.219 --> 29:46.873
Don't worry about it, Case.
No way you could have known.

29:47.041 --> 29:48.930
Yeah, but I could've stopped
trying to be

29:49.013 --> 29:51.169
Nancy freaking Drew
and minded my own business.

29:51.337 --> 29:53.922
- We won't argue with that.
- I'm gonna Miss this abandoned

29:54.090 --> 29:55.581
water pumping station.

29:59.631 --> 30:00.513
OK, guys.

30:00.680 --> 30:01.820
We've decided...

30:02.760 --> 30:05.058
... not to report you to the alumni.

30:05.226 --> 30:07.205
You both can stay in amphora.

30:07.288 --> 30:08.264
Thank you.

30:08.690 --> 30:10.897
As for you, intruder,

30:11.065 --> 30:13.164
being the first to find the lair is

30:13.560 --> 30:14.692
an impressive feat.

30:15.694 --> 30:16.819
We've decided

30:17.198 --> 30:19.921
to let you in
to the amphora society.

30:21.039 --> 30:23.076
Really? Are you guys OK with this?

30:23.603 --> 30:25.650
- Totally great.
- Totally. It'll be awesome.

30:26.487 --> 30:29.582
You must first perform
the amphora emotional purge.

30:30.156 --> 30:33.044
You will stand before us
and share your secrets,

30:33.404 --> 30:34.450
your truths,

30:35.397 --> 30:36.214
everything.

30:37.831 --> 30:38.833
Everything?

30:42.145 --> 30:43.823
So I guess I'll see you tomorrow?

30:50.054 --> 30:52.230
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like Clueless?

30:55.929 --> 30:57.835
I don't know.
I guess I just feel like

30:57.918 --> 30:59.872
I have to walk on eggshells
around you now.

31:00.345 --> 31:03.128
I mean, have you felt completely normal
since we got back together?

31:03.472 --> 31:04.851
Excuse me, sorry.

31:08.665 --> 31:10.068
Not completely.

31:10.949 --> 31:12.314
But we're fine now.

31:13.296 --> 31:15.837
Old Ash and Fisher,
picking up where we left off.

31:17.197 --> 31:19.092
It's not that simple,
I mean, I feel like

31:19.994 --> 31:23.670
if I make a wrong move,
you're gonna put me back on probation,

31:25.224 --> 31:26.627
or break up with me.

31:27.391 --> 31:28.815
I'm over what happened.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.133
I wouldn't have taken you back
if I didn't want to.

31:34.523 --> 31:37.673
That's great, but it doesn't
change the fact that...

31:40.133 --> 31:42.733
- I can't feel comfortable.
- You don't feel comfortable because

31:42.816 --> 31:44.157
you're not being yourself.

31:44.988 --> 31:46.183
Which sucks,

31:46.266 --> 31:48.620
'cause the person
I want to be with is you.

31:50.488 --> 31:51.662
The old you,

31:52.174 --> 31:53.339
the person who

31:53.422 --> 31:55.210
wasn't afraid to say
what he was thinking.

32:14.554 --> 32:16.689
Yeah, I just spent 40 bucks
on this hat.

32:16.980 --> 32:18.567
- Don't judge me.
- How can I?

32:18.650 --> 32:21.903
Falitza from borgton thought I was
too weird to have a relationship with.

32:22.192 --> 32:23.453
Wait, relationship?

32:23.945 --> 32:25.887
- You just met her.
- You know what I mean.

32:26.992 --> 32:29.452
- Nice leopard boy hat.
- From the man in the cape.

32:29.980 --> 32:31.792
What happened with vampira69?

32:32.171 --> 32:33.237
Funny story.

32:33.770 --> 32:35.833
- She turned out to be Sheila.
- Our landlady?

32:41.165 --> 32:42.477
Yeah, she wants to

32:42.962 --> 32:44.518
put her grill all...

32:44.900 --> 32:46.344
She wants to do it again.

32:47.228 --> 32:49.115
Rusty's hook-up didn't go
so well either.

32:49.744 --> 32:51.509
I'm thinking
about taking her back...

32:51.982 --> 32:52.998
And her front.

32:53.081 --> 32:55.002
You can't get back
with the landlady.

32:55.745 --> 32:57.888
- Tell him, Rus.
- What's wrong with going back?

32:58.351 --> 33:00.567
Maybe Sheila's the only
right person for Dale.

33:00.735 --> 33:03.301
Maybe he made a huge mistake
letting her go.

33:04.176 --> 33:05.863
He should do everything
to get her back.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.277
You've got your facts
wrong there, Rus.

33:08.360 --> 33:11.286
- She did me and dumped me.
- He's not talking about Sheila.

33:11.833 --> 33:14.080
Who are you to give
relationship advice, anyway?

33:14.248 --> 33:17.318
Come on. You can't even
be honest with your brothers

33:17.401 --> 33:19.335
about your relationship
with that Grant.

33:19.503 --> 33:21.161
What does this have to do with me?

33:21.559 --> 33:24.734
This is about you being afraid to put
yourself back out there and date again.

33:24.994 --> 33:27.505
I don't want to put myself
back out there!

33:28.256 --> 33:29.941
I had the perfect girl

33:30.376 --> 33:31.806
and I let her go.

33:32.902 --> 33:35.643
Why? Because long-distance can't work?
Says who?

33:36.443 --> 33:39.711
I made a mistake,
and it is not too late to fix it.

33:41.663 --> 33:43.311
Jordan and I can make this work.

33:48.712 --> 33:51.705
Well, that covers the summer
after high school.

33:51.934 --> 33:55.631
My friends and I made a pact
never to go back to lake Galena or

33:55.714 --> 33:57.846
that rest stop on route 93,
ever again.

33:58.208 --> 34:01.318
Let's see.
I started CRU in the fall.

34:01.401 --> 34:04.191
That's where I met Evan and Cappie
at the big KT rush party.

34:04.274 --> 34:05.950
Fast forward!
We know about that.

34:07.092 --> 34:08.264
I'm fast forwarding.

34:08.757 --> 34:11.679
- Cappie and I started to date...
- Keep it moving,

34:12.201 --> 34:15.292
I'll just skip ahead to the night
of the all-greek ball.

34:16.060 --> 34:18.436
Evan and Cappie got into a fight
that ended their friendship.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.074
I've always felt responsible.

34:23.464 --> 34:25.963
They were truly great friends,

34:26.045 --> 34:27.379
an unstoppable duo.

34:27.462 --> 34:30.315
And I never got over the fact
that it was me

34:30.801 --> 34:31.908
who stopped them.

34:33.010 --> 34:36.397
But we have a chance to get back
to what we were freshman year.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.216
We're three years older now,
maybe wiser.

34:43.418 --> 34:45.463
Evan and I found a way to get past

34:45.630 --> 34:47.164
bribery and corruption.

34:48.831 --> 34:50.121
Cappie found a way to

34:51.021 --> 34:52.134
move on to Lana.

34:54.580 --> 34:57.697
Even after Evan told me about Cappie

34:58.010 --> 35:00.208
at the end of the world party,
coming to see me...

35:00.792 --> 35:01.607
What?

35:02.346 --> 35:04.273
- You told her about that?
- It was no big deal.

35:05.651 --> 35:08.928
- Yeah, Cap, I did, but I was...
- He was high.

35:09.631 --> 35:11.989
Totally baked.
He was trying to eat shampoo.

35:13.640 --> 35:17.098
- Come on, what do you want me to say?
- Nothing. If that's even possible.

35:29.985 --> 35:31.106
Can you hear me?

35:33.690 --> 35:35.337
I think we made a mist...

35:43.841 --> 35:44.792
I think we...

35:51.402 --> 35:53.914
Thank you for your patience.
We will begin shortly.

35:58.324 --> 35:59.524
Please have video chat.

36:12.200 --> 36:14.740
Rusty, hey, finally!
What's up?

36:15.802 --> 36:19.139
Remember before you left I said
long-distance relationships can't work?

36:21.686 --> 36:22.777
I was wrong.

36:23.645 --> 36:25.632
A lot of people have
long-distance relationships.

36:25.959 --> 36:27.252
And I think we can, too.

36:30.697 --> 36:34.504
There'll be plenty of time to rekindle
our carnal flame after we see

36:34.629 --> 36:38.057
the opponent spiritual
and sometimes malevolent counterpoint.

36:38.841 --> 36:43.381
Our Q&A with Q aka John de Lancie
will begin momentarily.

36:43.506 --> 36:45.582
Just as soon as we finalize
our satellite feed.

36:46.045 --> 36:47.900
Why should we give up
on a great relationship

36:48.025 --> 36:49.920
just because we live
in different cities?

36:50.955 --> 36:52.250
We can have internet dates,

36:53.432 --> 36:54.716
and cook the same meals.

36:55.182 --> 36:58.018
Rent the same movies online
and watch them at the same time.

36:58.560 --> 36:59.468
Fall asleep

37:00.247 --> 37:01.743
next to the computers.

37:02.183 --> 37:04.897
Sounds like somebody could use
a little self-esteem.

37:05.536 --> 37:06.892
It'll be like you never left.

37:08.887 --> 37:09.650
Almost.

37:10.632 --> 37:12.752
And we will never have
to be single again.

37:17.672 --> 37:18.698
I miss you.

37:19.640 --> 37:20.747
I miss you, too.

37:22.530 --> 37:25.497
It sounds like you miss being
in a relationship more than you miss me.

37:25.919 --> 37:27.499
Come on, that's not it.

37:27.667 --> 37:29.167
Falling asleep on a keyboard?

37:29.519 --> 37:32.045
That's not a relationship.
I don't think you want that.

37:32.425 --> 37:33.703
And I know that I don't.

37:38.207 --> 37:39.424
What was that?

37:40.502 --> 37:41.620
Where are you?

37:45.055 --> 37:46.558
Who's that on our screen?

37:47.228 --> 37:48.645
What is going on here, Josh?

37:48.920 --> 37:51.030
I told you, all problems

37:51.155 --> 37:53.775
taken care of before
I get on the damn line!

37:54.258 --> 37:55.989
This is an abomination!

38:05.142 --> 38:08.311
About that night, I was leaving
the party to come see you, but I...

38:08.436 --> 38:09.291
It's fine.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.849
You don't have to explain it to me.

38:13.184 --> 38:14.061
That was...

38:14.836 --> 38:16.976
That was the pot brownie talking,
it wasn't me.

38:17.935 --> 38:21.286
- I wish I could take it back.
- Less talking, more not talking.

38:23.523 --> 38:25.131
I get this is why you were keeping

38:25.497 --> 38:26.706
all this from me.

38:26.936 --> 38:29.060
Because I might screw
it up and, apparently,

38:29.866 --> 38:30.910
you were right.

38:31.954 --> 38:34.698
I thought if the two of you
could be friends again,

38:34.823 --> 38:37.218
then maybe we could all go back
to the way things used to be.

38:38.449 --> 38:39.665
But I guess I was wrong.

38:41.976 --> 38:43.033
We can't go back.

38:44.659 --> 38:48.041
But maybe all three of us can
try to move forward together.

38:52.296 --> 38:53.371
I can try.

38:57.590 --> 39:01.509
Fellow amphoras, it is time
to resume the ancestry ritual.

39:02.303 --> 39:03.565
We can try.

39:03.690 --> 39:04.282
But

39:04.843 --> 39:06.556
this is your place down here.

39:06.724 --> 39:08.620
"down here, it's our time." wow,

39:08.745 --> 39:10.727
- gooniesreally does hold up.
- So good.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.173
I really appreciate
you guys letting me in,

39:15.905 --> 39:19.444
but I don't belong
in the amphora society.

39:20.863 --> 39:24.009
I really think a sacrifice
is an effective way...

39:24.134 --> 39:25.951
We're not gonna kill her.
Just drop it!

39:26.914 --> 39:30.205
You've purged all of your
deepest, darkest secrets.

39:30.373 --> 39:33.600
If you ever reveal anything
about the amphora society,

39:33.725 --> 39:35.333
it will go public.

39:35.862 --> 39:36.795
you understand?

39:38.044 --> 39:39.010
Understood.

39:39.540 --> 39:42.361
The events of this evening
will remain secret.

39:51.839 --> 39:53.085
That was humiliating.

39:53.615 --> 39:54.675
It wasn't that bad.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.131
She told me to get a life
in front of people

39:57.256 --> 39:58.899
who live in their
parents' basements.

39:59.024 --> 40:01.091
It sucks it didn't work
with you and Jordan.

40:01.450 --> 40:02.977
She was super hot.

40:03.833 --> 40:05.065
I tried to warn you.

40:05.766 --> 40:06.670
I know.

40:07.231 --> 40:09.755
I feel pretty bad about
what I said about you and...

40:09.880 --> 40:10.862
That grant?

40:13.013 --> 40:15.266
We do need to take our
relationship to the next level.

40:15.391 --> 40:17.510
And I need to stop moving
for a little while.

40:17.635 --> 40:20.296
I tried to turn an impractical
relationship into

40:20.464 --> 40:23.925
something rather than start over,
just because I hate the search.

40:24.093 --> 40:26.049
The search is the worst.
I'm done with it.

40:26.174 --> 40:28.138
I'm going back to what
gives me the most pleasure.

40:28.306 --> 40:31.320
- You don't told Sheila to take a hike?
- I did. I'm talking about god.

40:31.790 --> 40:33.601
Q brought me back.

40:33.769 --> 40:37.021
I was clinging to this notion of me
as this sexy atheist super-vilain.

40:37.146 --> 40:38.227
But that's not me.

40:38.352 --> 40:41.735
I mean, I'm sexy, but I'm not
an atheist and I'm not a super-villain.

40:43.743 --> 40:44.989
I'm Dale Kettlewell.

40:48.095 --> 40:50.105
Let's get out of here.
I don't think I can spend

40:50.230 --> 40:51.578
one more minute at comic-con.

40:53.080 --> 40:55.790
- Does leopard boy have a theme song?
- I don't think so.

40:56.422 --> 40:58.760
Come on. Sing it for us.
I'll get you started.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.420
Who's got spots?

41:01.066 --> 41:02.581
I got spots

41:03.007 --> 41:04.706
I got spots...

41:06.837 --> 41:10.141
I can't believe he couldn't
be honest with me about a stupid movie.

41:11.715 --> 41:13.933
Maybe it can't be like it was.

41:16.172 --> 41:17.096
Maybe.

41:20.275 --> 41:22.484
I thought you said
tailing cappie led nowhere.

41:22.652 --> 41:24.920
You're putting your friendship
theory to bed, remember?

41:25.696 --> 41:26.883
I know. I am.

41:27.612 --> 41:30.168
Cappie and evan will
never be friends again.

41:35.143 --> 41:36.957
- What's wrong?
- You can't cook.

41:37.082 --> 41:39.125
Leg warmers are not gloves.

41:39.293 --> 41:40.376
And duringclueless,

41:40.544 --> 41:43.838
I literally gagged twice and pretended
that I had popcorn caught in my throat.

41:45.549 --> 41:47.050
That was way harsh.

41:47.702 --> 41:52.180
But you do have really cute toes
and the most amazing laugh.

41:52.348 --> 41:54.310
And I am gonna try really,
really hard

41:54.747 --> 41:57.587
to make the new ash and fisher
even better than the old one.

41:59.971 --> 42:00.688
Me too.

42:14.620 --> 42:15.747
Who you toasting?

42:16.905 --> 42:18.706
Just raising a glass
to the party gods.

42:20.876 --> 42:22.168
Look at those jackasses.

42:23.902 --> 42:26.630
We should go finish what they started.
No, easy, bro, easy.

42:27.252 --> 42:29.075
Those douche bags aren't
worth the trouble.
