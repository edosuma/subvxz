Hello, I'm Kent Brockman,
and this is <i>Eye on Springfield.</i>

00:57.500 --> 01:02.930
( <i>rock and roll
instrumental theme playing )</i>

01:31.900 --> 01:33.400
Wow. Info-tainment.

01:33.470 --> 01:34.410
Tonight

01:34.470 --> 01:36.530
we salute the silver anniversary

01:36.610 --> 01:38.980
of The Great Springfield
Tire Yard Fire.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.070
25 years
and still burning strong.

01:42.150 --> 01:44.250
We watch
Springfield's oldest man

01:44.320 --> 01:46.590
meet Springfield's fattest man.

01:46.650 --> 01:48.190
He's not so fat.

01:48.250 --> 01:49.550
And we visit

01:49.620 --> 01:51.590
with heavyweight champion
Dredrick Tatum

01:51.660 --> 01:54.300
who reminisces about growing up
in Springfield.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.400
That town was a dump.

01:56.460 --> 01:59.370
If you ever see me there,
you know I really
( <i>bleeped ) up bad.</i>

01:59.430 --> 02:02.140
But first, part seven
of our eye-opening look

02:02.200 --> 02:03.440
at the bikini.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.700
( <i>rock and roll instrumental)</i>

02:09.740 --> 02:11.210
Whoa-- T and A!

02:11.280 --> 02:12.880
Bart, why are you still up?

02:12.950 --> 02:14.650
Lisa's slumber party.

02:14.710 --> 02:17.010
Who can sleep
with those five evil hens

02:17.080 --> 02:19.110
cackling
and plotting against me?

02:19.180 --> 02:22.050
They've got better things
to talk about than you.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.630
Sheesh, what an ego.

02:23.690 --> 02:25.930
Lisa, your brother
is so gross.

02:25.990 --> 02:27.960
You should smell
his room.

02:28.030 --> 02:30.470
( <i>giggling )</i>

02:30.530 --> 02:33.700
Now remember, Wanda,
whatever shape the wax takes

02:33.770 --> 02:35.900
that's what your
husband's job will be.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.680
It's a mop.

02:40.740 --> 02:42.510
My husband
will be a janitor.

02:42.570 --> 02:45.040
That looks like
an Olympic torch to me.

02:45.110 --> 02:46.580
Your husband could be
an Olympic athlete

02:46.650 --> 02:48.920
who will go on to have
a great acting career.

02:52.850 --> 02:54.190
It's a dustpan.

I'll take... dare.

I dare you to...

03:15.110 --> 03:16.680
Aaaaahh!

03:18.310 --> 03:20.680
I'm telling Mom and dad.

03:20.750 --> 03:21.720
You're telling who?

03:21.780 --> 03:22.380
Both:
Mom and dad.

Is anything the matter,

Why should I do that,
my lad?

03:47.640 --> 03:49.940
Because I'm jinxed,
damn it!... ow!

03:50.010 --> 03:51.180
What was that for?

03:51.240 --> 03:52.640
You spoke
while you were jinxed

so I get to
punch you in the arm.

That's it, I'm out of here.

Hiya, Homer.

( <i>sighing )</i>

04:46.900 --> 04:48.570
What's the matter, Moe?

04:48.630 --> 04:49.860
Oh, business is slow.

04:49.940 --> 04:52.340
People today are healthier and
drinking less.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.300
You know, if it wasn't for
the junior high school next door

04:54.370 --> 04:56.230
no one would even use
the cigarette machine.

04:56.310 --> 04:57.910
Yeah, things are tough all over.

04:57.980 --> 05:01.150
Increased job satisfaction
and family togetherness

05:01.210 --> 05:04.640
are poison for a purveyor
of mind-numbing intoxicants
like myself.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.550
Can I get a beer?

05:05.620 --> 05:06.350
Yeah, sure.

05:08.620 --> 05:09.520
Oh, sorry.

05:09.590 --> 05:10.220
I forgot
we're out of beer.

05:10.290 --> 05:10.890
Aahh!

05:10.960 --> 05:12.060
I know. I got behind

05:12.120 --> 05:13.620
on my beer payments.

05:13.690 --> 05:14.960
The distributor
cut me off

05:15.030 --> 05:18.600
and I spent my last ten grand
on the Love Tester.

05:18.660 --> 05:19.590
( <i>slurping )</i>

05:19.670 --> 05:21.400
You're too late,
Homer.

05:21.470 --> 05:23.100
Barney sucked it dry.

05:23.170 --> 05:25.070
Cut his gums up
pretty bad.

05:25.140 --> 05:26.440
Ohh!

05:26.510 --> 05:28.640
Take it easy, Homer.

05:28.710 --> 05:31.850
I learned how to make other
drinks at Bartender's school.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.520
Gin and... tonic?

05:34.580 --> 05:36.150
Do they mix?

05:36.210 --> 05:38.140
Hey, I know a good drink.

05:38.220 --> 05:40.090
Really hits the spot.

05:40.150 --> 05:42.160
I invented it myself.

05:42.220 --> 05:44.430
<i>One night,
Marge's beastly sisters</i>

05:44.490 --> 05:46.830

And this is Patty

trying to plug her leg razor

05:50.460 --> 05:53.390
into one of those ungodly
Czechoslovakian outlets.

05:53.470 --> 05:56.370
As you can see, we
never did get the hang of it.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.770
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

05:57.840 --> 06:00.210
<i>As I stared up at that

06:00.270 --> 06:02.040
<i>I knew I needed a drink.</i>

06:02.110 --> 06:05.250
Patty, Selma, would you
excuse me for a moment?

06:05.310 --> 06:08.580
If you're going for a beer,
this is the last one.

06:08.650 --> 06:09.280
D-ohhh!

06:09.350 --> 06:11.550
<i>I decided to mix</i>

06:11.620 --> 06:13.820

in every liquor bottle.</i>

06:13.890 --> 06:15.360
<i>In my haste</i>

06:15.420 --> 06:18.630
<i>I had grabbed a bottle
of the kids' cough syrup.</i>

06:23.460 --> 06:26.270
<i>It passed the first test--</i>

06:26.330 --> 06:28.940
<i>I didn't go blind.</i>

06:29.000 --> 06:32.010
They say everyone can float
in the Dead Sea

06:32.070 --> 06:34.280
but Selma sank
right to the bottom.

06:36.680 --> 06:37.510
Homer:
Huh?!

06:39.910 --> 06:42.850
<i>I don't know the scientific
explanation</i>

06:42.910 --> 06:44.880
<i>but fire made it good.</i>

06:44.950 --> 06:46.820
Sounds like one hell
of a drink.

06:46.890 --> 06:48.260
What do you call it?

06:48.320 --> 06:49.720
A Flaming Homer.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.130
Okay. Why don't you
make us up

06:51.190 --> 06:53.690
a couple
of Flaming Homers?

06:53.760 --> 06:55.360
You got any
cough syrup?

06:55.430 --> 06:57.300
Let me check the lost and
found. What do we got here?

06:57.360 --> 06:59.660
Bowie knife, troll doll...

06:59.730 --> 07:01.740
glass eye...

07:01.800 --> 07:02.840
( <i>shattering )</i>

07:02.900 --> 07:04.510
Oh, here we are.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.720
It's not without it's charm.

07:14.780 --> 07:16.450
Try lighting it on fire.

07:18.650 --> 07:19.950
Hmm?!

07:21.920 --> 07:23.260
Wow!

07:23.320 --> 07:25.930
Homer, it's like there's
a party in my mouth

07:25.990 --> 07:27.960
and everyone's invited.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.860
Hey,
your Love Tester's busted.

07:29.930 --> 07:31.600
I want my nickel back.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.990
( <i>coughing )</i>

07:33.070 --> 07:35.470
Hey, buddy,
have one on the house.

07:37.770 --> 07:39.710
Hey, this drink is delicious

07:39.770 --> 07:41.740
and my phlegm feels looser.

07:41.810 --> 07:43.210
What do you call it?

07:43.280 --> 07:44.810
Well, it's called a Flaming...

07:44.880 --> 07:45.610
...Moe!

07:45.680 --> 07:46.850
It's called a Flaming Moe.

07:46.910 --> 07:48.880
That's right, a Flaming <i>Moe.</i>

07:48.950 --> 07:51.720
My name is Moe,
and I invented it. That's
why it's called a Flaming Moe.

07:51.780 --> 07:53.210
What? What are you looking
at, Homer?

07:53.290 --> 07:54.420
It's a Flaming Moe.
I'm Moe.

07:57.490 --> 07:58.960
Oh!
Oh!

08:01.060 --> 08:02.160
Hey, what's this?

08:02.230 --> 08:03.730
A sneeze guard.

08:03.800 --> 08:04.830
( <i>sneezes )</i>

08:04.900 --> 08:07.270
Wow, it really works!

08:07.330 --> 08:09.060
Moe, I haven't seen
the place this crowded

08:09.130 --> 08:11.560
since the government
cracked down on you

08:11.640 --> 08:14.480
for accepting food stamps.
Do you think my drink has
something to do with it?

08:14.540 --> 08:17.280
Who can say?
It's probably a
combination of things.

08:17.340 --> 08:19.070
Another pitcher
of those amazing
Flaming Moes.

08:19.140 --> 08:21.640
I hate this joint,
but I love that drink.

08:21.710 --> 08:22.940
Ohhh.

08:23.010 --> 08:25.680
Barkeep, I couldn't
help noticing your sign.

08:25.750 --> 08:28.420
The one that says
"Bartenders do it
'til you barf"?

08:28.490 --> 08:30.490
No. Above that
store-bought
drollery.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.690
Oh, great.
Why don't we fill out
an application.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.929
I'll need your name,
measurements, and turn-ons.

08:35.990 --> 08:38.390
You really expect me
to tell you my measurements?

08:38.460 --> 08:40.020
You could,
but I find this way

08:40.100 --> 08:42.299
is much more accurate,
and fun.

08:42.370 --> 08:44.710
Ugh! What do you offer
in the way of salary?

08:44.770 --> 08:46.270
Minimum wage and tips.

08:46.340 --> 08:48.610
Of course,
there <i>are fringe benefits.</i>

08:48.670 --> 08:49.770
Such as?

08:49.840 --> 08:50.910
An unforgettable weekend

08:50.980 --> 08:52.610
at Club Moe.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.850
I'd prefer to take
my vacation
someplace <i>hot.</i>

08:54.910 --> 08:56.210
Whoo!
Ha-ha!

08:56.280 --> 08:57.390
Ow!
Whoo!

08:57.450 --> 08:59.350
I like your moxie, kid.

08:59.420 --> 09:00.760
You're hired.

09:00.820 --> 09:02.860
You shan't regret this.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.330
Me thinks I shan't.

09:04.390 --> 09:06.930
Pardon me, are you the
genius behind the Flaming Moe?

09:06.990 --> 09:08.830
Why yes, I...
I'm your man.

09:08.890 --> 09:12.290
Uh-huh. My name's Harv
Bannister. I work for
Tipsy McStagger's

09:12.360 --> 09:13.920
Good Time Drinking
and Eating Emporium.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.940
Oh, yeah? Hey, what's
Mr. McStagger really like?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.010
Actually, there is no
Tipsy McStagger.
He's just a composite

09:19.070 --> 09:20.880
of other successful logos.

09:20.940 --> 09:22.480
Well, you tell him for me

09:22.540 --> 09:24.810
that he makes
one great mozzarella stick.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.110
Yes, fine, I will.

09:26.180 --> 09:28.020
Anyway, I've got a
proposition for you.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.820
Keep talking.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.690
We feel your Flaming Moe
is perfect for our
restaurant chain.

09:32.750 --> 09:34.290
We want to buy the recipe.

09:34.350 --> 09:36.810
No dice.
The Flaming Moe is
not for sale.

09:36.890 --> 09:38.360
Do you know how much
of my blood and sweat

09:38.420 --> 09:39.650
are in this drink?

09:40.790 --> 09:42.390
Uh... figure of speech.

09:42.460 --> 09:43.430
Sorry, Harv.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.230
( <i>chuckles )</i>

09:46.300 --> 09:47.500
I'll be back.

09:50.270 --> 09:51.470
Good for you, Moe.

09:51.540 --> 09:53.340
Only an idiot
would give away

09:53.410 --> 09:55.410
a million-dollar idea
like that.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.600
Ohhh.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.580
Martin:
<i>So the next time you use</i>

09:58.640 --> 10:00.140
a gas chromatograph

10:00.210 --> 10:02.980
remember to thank
Mr. A.J.P. Morton.

10:03.050 --> 10:04.320
Brilliant, Martin.
Brilliant.

10:04.380 --> 10:07.450
Once again you've wrecked
the grading curve.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.220
I pity the student
who has to follow you.

10:10.290 --> 10:12.630
Bart Simpson,
you're next.

10:12.690 --> 10:15.660
"The Inventor I Admire"
by Bart Simpson.

10:15.730 --> 10:18.670
The inventor I admire
is not a rich man

10:18.730 --> 10:21.440
or a famous man,
or even a smart man.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.900
He's my father, Homer Simpson

There's a Moetinee.

19:07.390 --> 19:10.760
Of course. All work and Moe play

You're going to be

19:59.640 --> 20:02.640
I gotta tell you.
The way we usually work

20:02.710 --> 20:04.780
in these situations is to
steal the recipe

20:04.850 --> 20:07.220
and run the inventor
out of business.

The secret ingredient is...

Homer, no!

20:28.610 --> 20:30.980
...Cough syrup.

Hi, Moe.

Where's that waitress
of yours?

21:04.740 --> 21:06.870
She left to pursue
a movie career.

Frankly, I think she

Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds
