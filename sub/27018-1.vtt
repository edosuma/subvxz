[holiday fanfare plays]

00:37.912 --> 00:39.205
[Amber] Loyal readers,

00:39.289 --> 00:41.583
it's been 349 days,

00:41.666 --> 00:45.336
11 hours, 23 minutes, and seven seconds

00:45.420 --> 00:46.713
since I said "yes"

00:46.796 --> 00:49.674
to the love of my life,
Richard Bevan Charlton,

00:49.758 --> 00:50.967
King of Aldovia.

00:51.509 --> 00:52.761
But who's counting?

00:53.386 --> 00:56.347
Other than me and millions of people
around the world.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.392
Needless to say,
it's been a whirlwind year.

01:07.275 --> 01:10.528
There's been a lot of back and forth
between New York and Aldovia.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.670
[excited chatter]

01:32.926 --> 01:35.595
The long-distance engagement
hasn't always been easy,

01:35.678 --> 01:37.972
but it's always been interesting.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.352
[audience cheers]

01:42.435 --> 01:44.562
[man] Let's welcome Amber Moore,

01:44.646 --> 01:47.398
the future Queen of Aldovia.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.820
[woman] There she is. It's Amber Moore!

01:51.903 --> 01:54.280
[man] Amber!Â Amber!
Can I have your autograph?

01:55.031 --> 01:57.450
-I love you so much.
-[woman] I've never met a queen.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.744
[Amber] Somehow through all this insanity,

02:00.161 --> 02:01.246
I'm still me.

02:02.997 --> 02:06.000
Even though I'm about to become
queen of a small country.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.879
Thank you for all your love
and support this past year.

02:09.963 --> 02:13.133
Sharing my writing with all of you
means more than you'll ever know.

02:13.216 --> 02:16.386
I promise to keep you posted
on all my adventures to come,

02:16.469 --> 02:18.680
especially our wedding

02:18.763 --> 02:20.723
on Christmas day in Aldovia.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.144
[holiday fanfare plays]

02:35.446 --> 02:38.366
-[Rudy] What's with the sunglasses?
-[Amber] I don't want to get recognized.

02:38.449 --> 02:40.326
[Rudy] Yeah, I don't need a disguise.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.203
I feel like a brand new person.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.956
Must be this fresh mountain air
in Aldovenia.

02:45.039 --> 02:48.168
-Pop, it's Aldovia!
-Yeah, Aldovenia has more snap.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.794
As Queen, can you change it?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.505
I'm not sure how open they are to change.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.593
[brakes squeal]

02:59.137 --> 02:59.971
Amber?

03:00.054 --> 03:03.474
I'm damn stuck again, okay?
The samples were not good.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.351
Hey, you trying to steal our cab?

03:05.435 --> 03:06.436
Trying?

03:07.061 --> 03:09.189
No, darling, Sahil has the cab.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.398
Okay, bye.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.735
-If my daughter wasn't with me, I--
-[Amber] Pop?

03:13.818 --> 03:14.861
Huh?

03:15.528 --> 03:17.280
We don't need a cab after all.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.533
Looks like they sent the royal limos.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.576
[woman] There she is!

03:21.659 --> 03:23.995
Oh, so much for my plan
to slip in quietly.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.289
-[woman] Look, it's the Queen-to-be!
-[man] It is her!

03:26.372 --> 03:29.167
-Come, let's hurry before--
-Any comment on the King's initiative?

03:29.250 --> 03:31.836
-Will it affect the wedding?
-Amber, look this way, please.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.838
I am very happy to be back in Aldovia,

03:33.922 --> 03:36.633
and excited for the wedding and Christmas,

03:36.716 --> 03:38.134
and living the dream.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.804
Miss, sir, welcome to Aldovia.
Now, if you mind, quickly to the car.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.598
-Thank you.
-Amber, Amber, one more question!

03:43.681 --> 03:45.225
What are you thinking
about the wedding?

03:45.308 --> 03:47.310
The palace insisted that I greet you,

03:47.393 --> 03:49.562
and as you are now
a member of the royal family,

03:49.646 --> 03:51.064
protocol must be observed.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.566
My name is Mr. Louis Zabala,

03:53.650 --> 03:55.818
and I am your personal attache.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.947
And may I say, Miss,
it will be an honor to serve you.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.198
And you, Mr. Moore.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.449
[reporters] Amber!

04:01.532 --> 04:03.117
All right.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.203
[man] Amber, please, look back!

04:05.286 --> 04:07.080
[camera shutters clicking]

04:07.163 --> 04:09.457
-Amber, one more!
-Amber, one more picture, please.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.292
[holiday fanfare plays]

04:22.053 --> 04:24.806
Well, beats the Cross Bronx Expressway.

04:24.889 --> 04:25.807
I'll say.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.935
I can't get over the fact
this is gonna be my home.

04:29.644 --> 04:30.812
That makes two of us.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.568
-Hey, Louie.
-Sir?

04:38.069 --> 04:39.195
All this stuff free?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.698
Of course, sir. Please, do help yourself.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.207
When you shipped all your stuff over,
that was one thing,

04:51.291 --> 04:52.500
-but now...
-Pop.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.794
I'm gonna come visit New York
all the time,

04:54.877 --> 04:56.671
and you can come here
whenever you want.

04:57.755 --> 05:00.425
Imagine your mom
could see her little princess.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.010
A queen.

05:02.802 --> 05:03.886
She'd flip.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.641
She would definitely flip.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.935
[holiday fanfare continues]

05:26.284 --> 05:28.328
[Rudy] You gotta be kidding me.

05:28.911 --> 05:29.912
Not bad, huh?

05:32.040 --> 05:32.999
Amber!

05:33.583 --> 05:36.502
Emily! So good to see you again!

05:36.961 --> 05:38.171
I have so much to tell you.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.048
First, I received high marks
across the board.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.507
-Shocker!
-Best of all,

05:41.591 --> 05:43.217
my school's Christmas pageant
is coming up.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.594
I've been cast as the lead role!

05:44.677 --> 05:46.137
[Amber] That's so cool.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.806
Oh. Mrs. Averill, Mr. Little.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.641
-Ms. Moore.
-Welcome home.

05:50.725 --> 05:51.684
Is this her?

05:51.768 --> 05:53.019
Princess Emily?

05:53.686 --> 05:56.522
-Pleased to meet--
-I heard a lot about you, kiddo.

05:57.106 --> 06:00.735
The Princess shall not be addressed
as "kiddo."

06:00.818 --> 06:04.405
I am gonna bet that you are
the famous Mrs. Averill.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.865
Rudy Moore, put her there.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.536
-[chuckles]
-He looks different in person.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.289
-I thought he had a goatee.
-He shaved it for the wedding.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.000
Oy-way. Good grip.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.004
Well, shall we? [laughs awkwardly]

06:20.088 --> 06:22.256
Mr. Moore, have you ever been
inside a palace?

06:22.340 --> 06:24.133
I went to Caesar's Palace once.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.470
Now, I know, what happens in Vegas
is supposed to stay in Vegas,

06:27.553 --> 06:29.305
but let me tell you,
there was this one time--

06:29.389 --> 06:31.766
Pop, Pop, we can tell that story later.
Come on.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.686
No. Too bright.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.773
Too... too tropical.

06:40.483 --> 06:41.484
No.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.652
Too whimsical.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.862
It has to be...

06:44.946 --> 06:46.072
regal.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.491
New, but traditional.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.493
Youthful, but classic.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.037
Rhododendron is a nice flower.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.540
-Amber.
-It's so lovely to see you.

06:57.458 --> 07:01.087
We're having a welcome reception tonight
in your honor.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.257
And you must be--

07:04.340 --> 07:07.427
Rudy Moore, great to finally meet you!

07:07.510 --> 07:09.303
-[Rudy grunts]
-Ooh!

07:09.846 --> 07:11.264
[Rudy laughs]

07:11.347 --> 07:13.015
We're gonna be family.

07:13.474 --> 07:14.725
It's a brave new world.

07:14.809 --> 07:15.685
[both laugh]

07:15.768 --> 07:17.353
[Rudy] Hey, before you know it,

07:17.437 --> 07:20.022
we'll be sharing grandparent duties,
me and you.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.025
Mr. Moore, Mr. Moore,

07:23.109 --> 07:27.280
you must be exhausted by your journey,
as we are by your arrival.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.867
Let's give you a chance
to freshen up, shall we?

07:33.327 --> 07:34.912
See you at the reception, Mr. Moore.

07:35.371 --> 07:38.291
We're gonna burn the house down, kiddo.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.253
He doesn't mean that literally.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.005
One would hope not.

07:44.672 --> 07:45.631
Where's Richard?

07:47.175 --> 07:49.177
Oh, I-I thought he'd be here.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.554
He's been terribly busy of late.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.849
The King's duties never cease.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.519
Mr. Zabala, would you take Amber
upstairs, please?

07:58.936 --> 08:02.190
Until the wedding, you're going to have
your own bridal suite.

08:02.857 --> 08:03.816
Suite?

08:07.153 --> 08:08.362
Your suite.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.406
Sweet!

08:32.678 --> 08:34.347
"To my love, with all my heart.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.724
From this day forth,
we shall not be apart.

08:37.266 --> 08:38.976
Poetry can be a challenging art.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.229
If not yet mastered, here's a start."

08:41.896 --> 08:44.023
It's a limerick. Of sorts.

08:44.106 --> 08:45.900
-Hey!
-[Richard chuckles]

08:46.442 --> 08:48.277
Sorry I wasn't there to greet you.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.987
I had to finish decorating.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.615
Well, your decorating is amazing!

08:52.698 --> 08:55.117
I can't believe
this is actually happening. It's real!

08:55.201 --> 08:57.745
Oh, it's very real. "From this day forth,
we shall not be apart."

08:57.828 --> 09:00.122
Your poetry... not so amazing.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.290
[Richard laughs]

09:01.374 --> 09:06.379
Excuse me, Your Majesty. An urgent call
from the Minister for Economic Affairs

09:06.462 --> 09:07.964
and the Prime Minister.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.340
They insist.

09:09.924 --> 09:13.177
I have to take this. We'll have our time
this evening at the reception.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.849
[Amber exhales]

09:20.226 --> 09:22.645
[Mr. Little]
My lords, ladies, and gentlemen!

09:23.396 --> 09:24.522
King Richard

09:24.605 --> 09:27.483
and the guest of honor, our future Queen,

09:27.567 --> 09:29.735
Ms. Amber Moore.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.488
[fanfare plays, crowd applauds]

09:41.872 --> 09:43.457
Can I invite you to a meeting? Can I?

09:43.833 --> 09:44.875
Richard?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.377
Uh, I'll find you.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.337
[speaking indistinctly]

09:48.421 --> 09:50.464
Hi! How are you?

09:50.548 --> 09:52.008
[classical music plays]

10:03.561 --> 10:05.271
...with that, bring back control.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.273
[Helena] Ms. Amber Moore.

10:07.356 --> 10:10.234
-Hi.
-And Ambassador Wang and Mrs. Wang.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.820
And President Adina, Ms. Amber Moore.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.822
Hello, so lovely to meet you all.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.741
I should go save poor Richard.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.784
Best, I think, to leave him be.

10:19.118 --> 10:22.663
And you and I have a wedding to plan.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.875
I remember mine as if it was yesterday.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.878
And I want your day to be just as special.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.755
I want it to be perfect.

10:30.838 --> 10:35.885
And to that end, I have hired
the world's best wedding planner.

10:36.427 --> 10:39.597
Wedding designer, Your Majesty.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.474
Sahil designs,

10:41.557 --> 10:43.392
he does not plan.

10:44.310 --> 10:49.398
And designing a wedding
for this captivating creature...

10:49.982 --> 10:51.108
This...

10:51.192 --> 10:52.943
Venus...

10:53.402 --> 10:56.280
This Helen of Troy...

10:56.364 --> 10:57.198
[giggles]

10:57.281 --> 10:58.282
This--

10:58.658 --> 11:01.577
This shall be
Sahil's greatest achievement.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.578
Aww.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.289
Sahil Mattu.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.876
Sahil is honored to create for you

11:08.959 --> 11:11.671
the wedding of the century.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.757
-Fantastic. Well, I had a few ideas...
-Mm-hmm.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.927
-...that I thought we could talk about--
-Oh, the Baroness of Frankfurt.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.596
Yoo-hoo!

11:21.097 --> 11:23.057
Sahil designed her wedding last year.

11:23.140 --> 11:26.936
Mmm, Sahil designed
all six of her weddings.

11:27.395 --> 11:30.648
-Sahil was a child prodigy--
-Excuse me, pal. Don't I know you?

11:30.981 --> 11:32.149
Looking good, Peanut.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.777
You may know of Sahil,

11:34.860 --> 11:38.072
but I assure you, you do not know Sahil.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.323
Ignore this interloper.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.158
-That's my--
-[Sahil] You...

11:41.242 --> 11:44.662
are my canvas now, and Sahil the artist.

11:44.745 --> 11:48.040
Sahil will not rest
until we attain perfection.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.417
Perfection?

11:50.251 --> 11:53.254
Now, Sahil must go and prepare.

11:53.921 --> 11:56.507
Until tomorrow, Your Highnesses.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.967
Okay, thank you.

12:00.010 --> 12:00.928
Okay, bye.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.805
Wait a second.

12:02.888 --> 12:06.851
-That's the bum who stole our cab.
-Oh, no, Pop, please don't-- Oh.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.186
Hey, you! You cab-stealing phony!

12:09.270 --> 12:10.813
-Get back here!
-[Emily] Mr. Moore.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.274
May I bother you with a question?

12:13.607 --> 12:15.860
Call me Rudy, kiddo. We're family.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.445
What do you wanna know?

12:17.528 --> 12:21.282
I was curious, how does our palace compare
to that of Mr. Caesar?

12:21.365 --> 12:24.285
Better in every area but one.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.249
Amber and I call it "meat jelly."

12:30.332 --> 12:31.167
Yuck.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.711
I'd love to have a talk
with the palace chef.

12:33.794 --> 12:36.547
Maybe give him a few tips,
chef-to-chef, you know.

12:36.630 --> 12:40.134
I'm sure Chef Krasnov would love to hear
your culinary ideas.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.886
I'll see what I can arrange.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.848
Amber, Mrs. Averill has been promoted

12:45.931 --> 12:48.684
to head of Palace Office
of Press and Protocol.

12:49.351 --> 12:50.686
And in that capacity

12:50.770 --> 12:53.189
has requested a quick word
before the press photographs.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.231
Of course.

12:58.194 --> 13:02.656
It's clear that you've had
a very laissez-faire attitude

13:02.740 --> 13:05.534
concerning your image over the past year.

13:06.243 --> 13:09.288
Magazines, television, blogs.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.373
Blogs, that's what I do for a living.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.583
-I'm a professional--
-Oh, no.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.543
But now that you're part
of the royal family,

13:14.627 --> 13:17.254
we must be careful of the image
that you project.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.966
Consider me your protector.

13:22.051 --> 13:26.680
The goal is to see you and the crown
in the best possible light.

13:27.264 --> 13:29.809
Well, nothing shines
quite like the truth, right?

13:30.601 --> 13:32.144
I'm glad we see eye-to-eye.

13:32.520 --> 13:37.149
Please wait here and I'll have the King
and you pose for the photographs.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.277
[sighs]

13:41.487 --> 13:44.323
[whispers] One minute, down there.
Down there.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.500
When I was a boy,

13:54.583 --> 13:56.961
this is where I hid from Mrs. Averill
to avoid my lessons.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.046
You must have spent
a lot of time out here.

13:59.129 --> 14:00.339
Half my childhood.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.800
So, how are you bearing up?

14:03.425 --> 14:05.970
[exhales] Life in a fishbowl
takes getting used to.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.638
Mmm. Try being King.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.224
You've been groomed for this
your whole life.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.768
You still find it hard,
how am I gonna handle it?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.478
You're gonna do a brilliant job.

14:14.812 --> 14:15.688
I know it.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.108
Perhaps you can start by choosing
the perfect Christmas tree

14:19.191 --> 14:20.442
for the palace courtyard.

14:22.528 --> 14:26.407
My dad used to drive my mom and I out
to a farm each Christmas to find our tree.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.409
He told me how much it meant to you.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.536
Can we do that tomorrow?

14:30.953 --> 14:35.165
Uh, not tomorrow. Perhaps the day after.
Tomorrow the King must give a speech.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.959
Oh, what kind of speech?

14:37.418 --> 14:41.046
Well, you know my initiative,
"Bring Aldovia into the 21st Century."

14:41.130 --> 14:43.465
Strengthening infrastructure,
schools, tech.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.259
-It's smart.
-That's what I thought.

14:45.718 --> 14:49.263
But instead of strengthening the economy,
the country is bleeding money.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.723
Nobody can tell me why.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.058
Is there anything I can do to help?

14:53.601 --> 14:55.519
Something tells me
that wedding preparations

14:55.603 --> 14:57.021
are going to keep you occupied.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.619
[Sahil] Rise and shine, my sleepy beauty.

15:12.119 --> 15:15.039
We have much preparation to do
and very little time.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.207
[sighs]

15:17.958 --> 15:18.959
Thanks.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.461
[Sahil] Welcome...

15:20.836 --> 15:23.464
to Sahil's masterpiece.

15:25.090 --> 15:28.802
The Bavarian orchestra
will start precisely at your entrance

15:28.886 --> 15:31.722
with the release of the Barbary doves.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.850
South African wildflowers...
[snaps fingers]

15:34.934 --> 15:37.686
will adorn your path down the aisle.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.439
I mean, you won't, and I mean it--

15:40.773 --> 15:43.233
you won't be able to take a step

15:43.317 --> 15:47.112
without a Namaqualand daisy between
the floor and your Jimmy Choo-Choos.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.072
Choo-Choos?

15:48.822 --> 15:51.533
Your footwear, very important.

15:51.909 --> 15:52.785
Hmm.

15:53.577 --> 15:55.537
There will be a roast pig

15:55.621 --> 15:58.999
from each of Aldovia's seven provinces.

15:59.083 --> 16:02.461
Montrachet Grand Cru
will be in every goblet.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.464
Nineteen-ninety-two. Hmm?

16:06.006 --> 16:07.091
[exhales]

16:07.174 --> 16:09.718
But of greatest importance...

16:11.053 --> 16:12.221
is the star

16:12.554 --> 16:15.975
around which all the wonder circulates.

16:16.058 --> 16:19.144
[inhales] And that, of course, is...

16:19.853 --> 16:20.729
the gown!

16:23.232 --> 16:25.484
Wow, that-- that's-- that's extravagant.

16:26.527 --> 16:31.073
[Sahil] Yes! An extravaganza
of style and taste.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.867
A bravura of haute couture!

16:39.373 --> 16:40.666
You are...

16:41.291 --> 16:42.251
welcome.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.421
Uh, Sahil,

16:45.796 --> 16:47.423
I must-- Thank you.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.719
This dress is very eye-catching,

16:52.386 --> 16:56.682
but I was actually looking
for something a little more... simple.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.308
Simple?

16:58.642 --> 16:59.560
You know, just...

17:00.019 --> 17:00.853
more me.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.859
When you envision

17:07.568 --> 17:10.320
yourself in this gown, hmm,

17:11.363 --> 17:14.074
think not of who you are, unh-unh,

17:14.158 --> 17:18.287
but who you shall be.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.205
And, um...

17:20.289 --> 17:24.960
you should bear in mind
that this design wasÂ inspired

17:25.544 --> 17:27.880
by Queen Helena's ownÂ wedding gown.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.340
Right, right, which--
which I'm sure was just...

17:31.216 --> 17:33.552
beautiful and very much of the time,

17:33.635 --> 17:36.513
but I'm looking for something
more contemporary.

17:36.597 --> 17:40.768
The Kingdom of Aldovia has over 700 years

17:40.851 --> 17:43.729
of history and tradition.

17:43.812 --> 17:48.650
An established set of protocols exist
to guide every decision.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.236
Which I respect, but times are ch--

17:51.320 --> 17:54.615
These protocols have protected
the royal family

17:55.032 --> 17:58.077
since long before
you set foot in our kingdom.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.704
I didn't realize that becoming
part of the royal family

18:00.788 --> 18:02.998
meant having to give up who I am.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.126
[Amber sighs]

18:06.585 --> 18:07.961
May we continue?

18:11.965 --> 18:13.342
[inhales deeply]

18:15.385 --> 18:17.262
It's not even my wedding anymore.

18:17.971 --> 18:21.391
This protocol is driving me crazy.
It's like Bridezilla in reverse.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.519
Forgive me if I don't ooze sympathy

18:23.602 --> 18:27.147
from the night security desk
of Noodle Chalet's corporate office.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.482
Hey, at least you've got a job.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.776
I've been living with my parents
for the last three months

18:30.859 --> 18:31.985
since Now Beat shut down.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.738
Now Beat? It was Beat Now.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.532
Whatever. It's gone now.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.200
But enough about our problems.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.868
You're having some royal pains?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.829
Right, perspective.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.123
I still need a shoulder to cry on.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.458
Have you talked to Richard
about any of this?

18:46.834 --> 18:49.920
I haven't even seen him today.
They know how to keep the King busy.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.005
Just hurry up and get here already.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.716
Counting down the seconds, trust.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.135
[sighs]

18:56.218 --> 18:58.428
["O Come All Ye Faithful" plays on piano]

19:13.068 --> 19:14.695
[Mr. Zabala hits wrong note]

19:16.196 --> 19:18.365
That sounds amazing.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.075
Don't stop on account of me.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.911
That was on account of Mr. Zabala.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.913
He's a tad rusty.

19:24.997 --> 19:29.251
And if you practiced between lessons,
you might get to play this on your own.

19:29.626 --> 19:31.086
[Mr. Zabala chuckles]

19:31.170 --> 19:33.505
You still haven't let me tell you
about my Christmas pageant.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.174
I need help finishing my costume.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.300
I'm in.

19:36.633 --> 19:39.094
Oh, if protocol allows.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.222
I'll make sure
that I schedule a conference

19:42.306 --> 19:44.933
between you and Princess Emily.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.854
And I've cleared it for you
to join King Richard.

19:50.147 --> 19:55.235
Behind me stands an enduring symbol
of Aldovia's historical strength.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.113
Before me, and all of us,

19:58.697 --> 20:01.366
lies our current revitalization project,

20:01.742 --> 20:05.120
a symbol of Aldovia's shining future.

20:05.204 --> 20:09.416
-[camera shutters clicking]
-For crops to flourish, rain must fall.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.294
Likewise, today's temporary hardships

20:12.377 --> 20:16.673
will soon spur on
a bountiful future for all.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.258
[cheering and applause]

20:18.342 --> 20:19.218
[booing]

20:19.301 --> 20:21.803
[man] What about our jobs?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.347
[booing]

20:23.680 --> 20:25.557
[man 2] The country's going broke!

20:25.641 --> 20:28.644
[protesters continues booing and yelling]

20:30.646 --> 20:32.231
[man 3] Shame on the King!

20:32.314 --> 20:34.858
[dark music plays]

20:34.942 --> 20:37.736
A new Aldovian chapter

20:37.819 --> 20:39.279
is about to begin.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.406
And I'm honored and excited

20:41.490 --> 20:45.202
to shareÂ that journey
with each and every one of you.

20:45.285 --> 20:46.119
[booing]

20:46.203 --> 20:49.164
I wish you all a very Merry Christmas

20:49.248 --> 20:51.041
and a prosperous New Year.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.126
[cheering and applause]

20:53.210 --> 20:54.795
[man] This isn't right for Aldovia!

20:54.878 --> 20:56.463
[woman] We're going broke!

20:56.546 --> 20:59.007
[man 2] Talk, talk, talk,
we've heard it before!

20:59.091 --> 21:00.008
Thank you.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.093
[booing]

21:01.176 --> 21:03.762
[Richard] I feel like a total fraud
reading out that propaganda.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.472
Your ideas make perfect sense,

21:05.555 --> 21:07.391
I just don't understand
why they're not working.

21:07.474 --> 21:08.517
Neither do I.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.186
When numbers don't add up,
there's usually a reason.

21:11.979 --> 21:15.315
What? Who do you think
balanced Dad's books at the diner?

21:15.732 --> 21:17.818
Amber, this isn't a diner,
it's a kingdom.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.279
And I'm gonna be Queen,
I wanna contribute.

21:21.154 --> 21:25.158
You're gonna make an excellent queen, but
we mustn't let politics come between us.

21:25.242 --> 21:28.578
We should be doing everything we can
to help the kingdom, right?

21:29.204 --> 21:30.205
Absolutely.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.791
Maybe there should be
a revitalization effort

21:32.874 --> 21:34.710
to bring the royal family
into the 21st century.

21:35.168 --> 21:38.171
-Amber, I think it's hardly--
-An excellent speech, Your Highness.

21:38.255 --> 21:42.551
Now I need you to come meet the press
with your most confident smiles.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.014
[dark music plays]

21:54.104 --> 21:55.314
[spoon clatters]

21:55.814 --> 21:57.607
I said simmer, not hellfire!

21:58.567 --> 21:59.985
I need this ten minutes ago.

22:00.068 --> 22:01.695
Excuse me, Miss.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.990
Putrid! Start from scratch.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.327
Yeah, I was told a chef was expecting me.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.289
Who are you and what are you doing
in my kitchen?

22:13.206 --> 22:15.876
I expect no one
except the father of the Queen-to-be.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.670
Well, that's me. Rudy Moore.

22:19.880 --> 22:20.714
Oh.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.177
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Pleasure is mine.

22:25.677 --> 22:29.306
You know, I'm actually a chef myself.
Yeah, I got my own place in New York City.

22:29.389 --> 22:31.808
-Really? What's its name?
-Rudy's Diner.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.686
-Diner?
-Yeah.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.856
Yeah, I thought we could give the wedding
guests a little taste of New York.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.443
Excuse my posing, I'm in shock.

22:41.526 --> 22:44.071
[laughs] Oh, I get it.
Too many cooks, huh?

22:44.154 --> 22:45.989
No, this is your kitchen,
I'm just here to help.

22:48.158 --> 22:48.992
Dishes.

22:49.618 --> 22:50.452
Excuse me?

22:50.827 --> 22:52.079
You start with dishes.

22:56.875 --> 23:00.212
The press office assures me
your speech today will do a world of good.

23:00.295 --> 23:01.505
Less than a year into my reign,

23:01.588 --> 23:03.590
I feel like I'm running the kingdom
into the ground.

23:03.673 --> 23:05.550
Oh, you put much too much pressure
on yourself.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.594
-It's my initiative, Mother.
-Richard...

23:07.677 --> 23:10.889
your father first proposed the need
for such a program.

23:10.972 --> 23:14.643
Lord Leopold oversaw the implementation
and the country backed it.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.063
Economic fluctuation is a fact of life.

23:18.146 --> 23:20.690
Yes, but I can't help but feel
Father would be disappointed.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.275
Oh, nonsense!

23:23.276 --> 23:26.071
You mustn't let this put a strain
on the season.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.073
Or the wedding.

23:28.156 --> 23:30.367
I hear the stress may be getting to Amber.

23:30.450 --> 23:33.954
Can I not have a single conversation
without it being observed and reported?

23:34.037 --> 23:34.996
Darling,

23:35.539 --> 23:38.417
I just-- I just want you to be happy.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.421
And to that end,
I've asked Lord Leopold to come back.

23:42.879 --> 23:45.882
But he seemed so keen to retire
after launching the initiative.

23:45.966 --> 23:49.928
Well, only because he found it
too difficult to continue without Father.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.473
But he's graciously agreed
to come back from Monaco

23:53.557 --> 23:55.934
to help us through
these challenging times.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.478
Mother...

23:59.813 --> 24:00.689
Thank you.

24:01.064 --> 24:03.066
["God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" plays]

24:10.740 --> 24:13.326
[Rudy] Do you put the stockings
on the tree

24:13.410 --> 24:15.412
or you put them on your chimney?

24:15.495 --> 24:16.371
[Amelia] Chimney.

24:16.746 --> 24:18.373
I do feel I need to apologize.

24:18.790 --> 24:22.085
-Really, I appreciate that, but--
-I don't know what came over me.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.212
The pressures I'm facing as King
are no excuse

24:24.296 --> 24:26.173
for my lack of enthusiasm earlier.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.508
Can you forgive me?

24:29.050 --> 24:30.677
I really would like to help.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.804
There's actually some very good news
on that front.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.015
Lord Leopold,
one of Father's most trusted advisors,

24:35.098 --> 24:37.017
has agreed to return to give guidance.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.435
[Richard inhales sharply]

24:38.518 --> 24:39.811
Which is quite a relief.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.022
And I know Father would have been pleased.

24:42.105 --> 24:44.024
Whatever you two are discussing can wait.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.651
I have an urgent matter
vital to all of Aldovia to discuss.

24:47.277 --> 24:48.820
And what might that be?

24:48.904 --> 24:53.116
The people of Aldovia demand a magnificent
royal Christmas tree to make them proud.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.367
And so far we have none.

24:54.951 --> 24:56.411
The palace courtyard is bare.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.498
As King, I implore you
to rectify the situation.

24:59.581 --> 25:00.916
Here, here.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.959
Well, that is precisely the kind of issue

25:03.043 --> 25:06.880
where a king greatly benefits
from the presence of his queen.

25:06.963 --> 25:08.798
It shall be rectified tomorrow.

25:09.049 --> 25:09.883
[knock on door]

25:13.428 --> 25:14.721
Your Majesties.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.806
You have a guest.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.267
Lord Leopold, already?

25:19.643 --> 25:20.769
Send him in.

25:22.479 --> 25:23.897
[dark music plays]

25:33.990 --> 25:34.908
Simon.

25:35.992 --> 25:37.077
Hello, all.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.164
-Your Majesties.
-It's all right, Mr. Zabala.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.793
He appears to be in no shape
to do us any further harm.

25:45.502 --> 25:46.628
Queen Helena,

25:47.420 --> 25:48.505
Merry Christmas.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.340
What do you want, Simon?

25:51.508 --> 25:54.719
I know I deserve to be met
with such hostility.

25:55.303 --> 25:56.263
Wait a minute.

25:56.346 --> 25:59.266
-Is this the guy--
-Who tried to steal Richard's crown? Yes.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.560
I'm amazed to see your face here.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.812
After the unfortunate...

26:04.604 --> 26:06.731
incident last Christmas,

26:07.440 --> 26:12.529
I lost almost everything I had
to Sophia in the divorce.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.489
Just desserts!

26:16.157 --> 26:17.909
I don't expect you to forgive me.

26:19.202 --> 26:21.204
But I wanted to say I'm sorry.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.164
And Merry Christmas.

26:24.165 --> 26:25.667
And congratulations.

26:26.793 --> 26:27.794
To you both.

26:30.046 --> 26:30.880
And, well...

26:32.048 --> 26:32.966
Wait.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.806
I don't know how you'll ever
regain our trust.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.184
But we're still cousins.

26:44.519 --> 26:45.729
We're family.

26:47.689 --> 26:48.940
And it's Christmas.

26:57.532 --> 26:59.117
[birds chirping]

27:00.827 --> 27:02.954
[Sahil] Ms. Moore, eyes on me.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.166
Now, profile to the right.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.253
Profile to the left.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.133
It's perfect.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.635
It's fabulous.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.011
Stunning.

27:18.386 --> 27:19.512
Regal.

27:19.596 --> 27:20.764
Divine.

27:21.681 --> 27:22.641
Not quite.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.184
Hey.

27:24.267 --> 27:26.811
We need to take out the derriere
a touch, hmm.

27:27.228 --> 27:30.440
And take in the bust.
But first... [snaps fingers]

27:32.359 --> 27:33.485
The veil.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.278
["Joy to the World" plays]

27:40.742 --> 27:41.660
[sighs]

27:42.535 --> 27:43.828
Take a look.

27:44.871 --> 27:48.124
Tell Sahil you adore it.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.417
I can't see.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.169
[Sahil laughs]

27:51.711 --> 27:54.255
We are looking for you, darling. Hmm.

27:54.339 --> 27:57.092
And believe us, you are to die for.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.011
Wait until you see it flow.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.389
-Take it down, Your Highness.
-[Amber] I--

28:02.972 --> 28:04.140
I can't walk in these.

28:04.224 --> 28:08.103
You don't have to walk,
you have to glide. Hmm.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.771
Glide.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.023
Glide.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.066
Feel it...

28:13.817 --> 28:14.943
inside.

28:15.026 --> 28:15.944
Mmm.

28:18.238 --> 28:21.074
That dress is something. Yes, Mr. Zabala?

28:21.991 --> 28:24.828
I think the opinion of the bride-to-be

28:24.911 --> 28:26.996
is much more important than ours.

28:27.330 --> 28:31.000
Well, as I said about the sketch,
I think it's a little elaborate.

28:31.084 --> 28:34.129
Nothing is too elaborate for a queen.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.131
It-- it sets the image.

28:36.214 --> 28:39.008
Not to mention the amount of work
that went into this.

28:39.384 --> 28:44.013
Furthermore, this gown was
Queen Helena's sole request

28:44.556 --> 28:49.102
before she hands over her son
and her crown to you.

28:49.602 --> 28:50.603
[Sahil] Very true.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.109
[Rudy] One Coney Island bloodhound,

28:57.569 --> 28:59.404
and a blonde with sand.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.365
You're my hero.

29:03.658 --> 29:06.244
So, you bonding with the chef yet?
Where is he?

29:06.327 --> 29:07.287
Eh, she.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.664
Out shopping with the staff.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.417
Oh, I needed a break.

29:12.876 --> 29:15.044
Yeah, a lot of mutual, uh...

29:16.004 --> 29:17.630
respect between us.

29:18.214 --> 29:19.507
Eh, different styles.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.552
There's a lot of things
that are different here.

29:23.386 --> 29:24.304
You feeling it, too?

29:25.889 --> 29:28.683
I feel like it's my wedding,
but it's not my wedding.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.269
All this pomp and circumstance.

29:31.352 --> 29:33.563
It's like, at this point,
I'm almost dreading the big day.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.315
It's your wedding.

29:35.982 --> 29:38.526
Your special day. Nobody's gonna ruin it.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.987
There somebody I need to straighten out?

29:41.404 --> 29:42.322
No.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.033
I just always thought that my wedding

29:45.116 --> 29:47.660
would be about being
with the person I love, with--

29:48.203 --> 29:50.497
with all the people that I love
there with me.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.042
Christmas without Mom
is always gonna be hard.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.544
But getting married without her...

29:58.838 --> 30:00.715
I guess we're both feeling that, huh?

30:01.758 --> 30:03.927
Hey, I've got something for you. Um...

30:04.761 --> 30:07.889
I planned on giving it to you
on your wedding day, but...

30:08.807 --> 30:11.267
I think you could use an angel
on your shoulder.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.857
She would be so proud of you.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.863
[voice breaking] So proud.

30:25.532 --> 30:26.574
[Rudy] Oh.

30:34.874 --> 30:35.834
And...

30:38.378 --> 30:40.338
VoilÃ ! What do you think?

30:40.421 --> 30:42.507
Far better. It's perfect.

30:43.299 --> 30:45.969
If I can't dress myself for my wedding,
at least I can make you shine.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.805
If you want me to place a mouse
in the vicinity of Sahil,

30:48.888 --> 30:49.764
please let me know.

30:49.848 --> 30:50.849
Don't tempt me.

30:51.391 --> 30:52.600
So what's this play about?

30:52.684 --> 30:54.394
The story of Princess Froon,

30:54.477 --> 30:57.355
a fair maiden who granted Santa Claus
his magical powers.

30:58.648 --> 31:02.068
The most famous Aldovian Christmas story.
You haven't heard of it?

31:02.402 --> 31:03.486
Not yet.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.821
Come on, sit down.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.451
Okay, so.

31:10.535 --> 31:13.788
Princess Froon was coveted for her ability
to grant magical powers.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.749
One day she was captured
by a big, hairy ogre named Grundle--

31:16.833 --> 31:18.877
-Like Shrek!
-Nothing like Shrek.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.546
Grundel traps Princess Froon
inside a castle made of ice.

31:21.629 --> 31:22.505
Like Frozen?

31:22.589 --> 31:23.423
Not at all.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.342
Grundel was going to eat her
for breakfast, when his pet turtle--

31:26.426 --> 31:27.969
-Turtle?
-Yes.

31:28.344 --> 31:30.430
His turtle found a little baby
in the woods.

31:30.513 --> 31:32.640
And when he brings the baby to the castle,

31:33.016 --> 31:35.435
she cares for it
and nurses it back to health.

31:35.518 --> 31:38.688
Her kindness melts the ogre's heart
and he falls in love with her.

31:39.355 --> 31:40.815
The end?

31:40.899 --> 31:42.901
No. The ogre sets the princess free,

31:42.984 --> 31:44.986
so then she turns the baby
into Santa Claus.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.989
And she kisses the ogre
to say goodbye and thank you,

31:48.489 --> 31:51.701
and he turns into a dashing knight
in shining armor.

31:51.784 --> 31:52.702
The end.

31:53.536 --> 31:54.871
And it's all true?

31:54.954 --> 31:55.788
Obviously.

31:56.205 --> 31:59.918
How else do you think Santa got his magic?
He couldn't have just been born with it.

32:00.376 --> 32:02.295
Who's playing your knight
in shining armor?

32:02.378 --> 32:03.755
No one special.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.256
Just a boy.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.008
A boy, huh?

32:07.091 --> 32:08.217
[exhales]

32:08.301 --> 32:09.510
He's really shy.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.095
His name's Tom Quill.

32:11.512 --> 32:12.639
Sounds cute.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.557
Don't be silly!

32:15.934 --> 32:18.227
-Shut up!
-I didn't say anything.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.939
You're so totally blushing right now.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.023
[Emily laughs]

32:29.739 --> 32:32.241
Time to find the most perfect tree
on the mountain.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.788
-Are you serious?
-Didn't you fall off last time you rode?

32:36.871 --> 32:39.791
Yes, but these horses are
much better natured than your last.

32:39.874 --> 32:42.710
-What about the wolves?
-No wolves, I promise.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.212
But you need to watch outÂ for yetis.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.129
[Mr. Zabala laughs]

32:45.213 --> 32:48.549
If I wasn't more excited about this than
anything in the world,Â I'd be worried.

32:48.633 --> 32:51.052
But I am more excited about this
than anything in the world.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.053
So am I.

32:52.136 --> 32:55.556
I've cleared both your schedules,
so take as long as you like.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.808
Find a good one.

32:56.891 --> 32:57.892
We will.

32:58.559 --> 32:59.894
[Mr. Little] King Richard!

33:00.269 --> 33:02.188
I am most sorry, Your Majesty,

33:02.271 --> 33:04.357
but you are needed in theÂ chancellery
at once.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.775
Why on earth?

33:05.858 --> 33:08.444
The unions are calling
for a nationwide strike

33:08.528 --> 33:12.281
in solidarity over unpaid wages
on our work programs.

33:12.740 --> 33:15.868
I need to deal with this, Amber.
Can we choose a tree tomorrow?

33:16.369 --> 33:17.286
I'm sorry.

33:21.499 --> 33:22.750
[Emily] Sorry, Amber.

33:23.334 --> 33:26.337
But as you don't appearÂ to be
terribly busy this afternoon,

33:26.421 --> 33:28.840
I have a final rehearsal.
I could use your input.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.008
Shall we?

33:31.092 --> 33:32.093
We shall.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.432
Why must you trap me here, Grundle?

33:37.849 --> 33:39.475
Your fair beauty hurts my eyes.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.061
But that is not why I trap you here.

33:42.145 --> 33:44.772
I trap you here because I want your magic!

33:45.148 --> 33:46.774
You cannot force me to use it.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.651
I must believe in my heart!

33:49.402 --> 33:50.695
Then I shall eat you.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.865
And your magic shall seep
into my flesh and stones!

33:54.657 --> 33:55.783
I think it's "bones."

33:55.867 --> 33:56.826
[Emily laughs]

33:56.909 --> 33:59.037
-That's what I said, isn't it?
-Never mind.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.621
Let's move on to scene 12.

34:01.956 --> 34:02.832
Um...

34:03.374 --> 34:06.085
Isn't that the one where we...

34:07.587 --> 34:08.421
kiss?

34:08.963 --> 34:09.922
Is it?

34:10.214 --> 34:11.966
-[woman gasps]
-What's going on?

34:12.884 --> 34:13.968
[people murmuring]

34:16.763 --> 34:18.056
This can't be right.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.478
What's going on?

34:23.561 --> 34:25.897
Why did the lights go off?
Why is everybody leaving?

34:25.980 --> 34:28.649
The theater workers
have gone on strike in solidarity.

34:28.983 --> 34:30.735
Our performance is cancelled.

34:31.527 --> 34:32.695
I'm so sorry.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.864
Maybe they can get things together
in time.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.657
The performance was tomorrow.

34:38.367 --> 34:41.037
You would have been
a brilliant Princess Froon, Emily.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.456
Not just because you're a real princess.

34:44.207 --> 34:45.208
Uh...

34:45.291 --> 34:47.418
I'm sorry we didn't get to do the play.

34:48.336 --> 34:49.378
Anyway,

34:49.796 --> 34:51.130
have a nice Christmas,

34:51.214 --> 34:52.298
Your Highness.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.258
You make a brilliant ogre, Tom.

34:55.468 --> 34:56.469
Thanks?

34:58.763 --> 35:01.015
And a brilliant knight in shining armor.

[Amber sighs]

35:04.936 --> 35:06.187
[chain jangles]

35:12.652 --> 35:14.403
I'm so sorry, Emily.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.948
No Christmas play, no Christmas tree.

35:17.031 --> 35:18.741
There won't even be a Christmas
at this rate.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.868
Of course there's gonna be Christmas.

35:21.702 --> 35:23.746
Richard is working really hard
to make things better.

35:23.830 --> 35:26.290
And I hear help is on the way.

Your Majesty.

35:30.253 --> 35:31.546
Leopold!

35:34.715 --> 35:36.425
Thank you so much for coming.

35:36.509 --> 35:40.304
-It's good to be back in Aldovia.
-And Aldovia's delighted to have you back.

35:41.347 --> 35:44.100
I understand the situation is critical.

35:44.725 --> 35:48.896
Richard, and all of us, are very anxious
to hear what advice you have to give.

35:49.564 --> 35:50.690
Cancelled?

35:50.773 --> 35:53.192
So I'm not only failing the nation,
I'm also failing my sister.

35:53.276 --> 35:54.819
No one thinks that. We'll figure it out.

35:54.902 --> 35:57.947
The ministers today were in panic,
mostly for their own positions.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.448
I need people around me I can trust.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.534
Like Mother, Lord Leopold,
and most of all, you.

36:01.617 --> 36:04.162
King Richard, I was hoping
for a moment of your time.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.664
-Moments are in short supply, Simon.
-[Simon] I understand.

36:06.747 --> 36:09.333
I just wanted to thank you again
for taking me back into the fold.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.127
That's putting it a bit generously,
isn't it?

36:11.210 --> 36:13.671
Perhaps, but I'd like to do something
to repay you.

36:13.754 --> 36:14.589
Both.

36:14.672 --> 36:18.092
I may have a solution
to Aldovia's financial crisis.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.344
There's this new crypto-currency
I've been researching.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.346
By investing just a fraction
of what you've sunk--

36:22.430 --> 36:25.308
I should've known this was about getting
your hands on the kingdom's money.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.518
Richard, cousin, no.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.353
It's just as I say, I want to help!

36:29.437 --> 36:31.689
-I have a degree in economics from Oxford.
-You do?

36:31.772 --> 36:34.108
Which he hardly worked for,
which he's squandered ever since.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.320
All I'm asking is that you to hear me out.
I have a sound plan.

36:37.778 --> 36:39.614
Give me a chance to redeem myself.

36:41.824 --> 36:43.367
[door closes, Simon sighs]

36:47.371 --> 36:50.041
Richard, my boy, three words for you.

36:52.084 --> 36:53.461
Stay the course.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.005
Even in light of everything
that's happened?

36:56.088 --> 36:58.591
We put into action
what your father dreamed of doing

36:58.674 --> 37:00.384
for the last years of his reign.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.719
May he rest in peace.

37:03.971 --> 37:07.099
But the situation has changed so vastly
since then.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.602
Are there really no adjustments
you'd consider?

37:10.561 --> 37:11.729
Patience.

37:11.812 --> 37:16.108
This kind of long-term investment
in roads, hospitals, schools...

37:16.192 --> 37:17.276
it's good business.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.861
Just as I've been saying.

37:20.613 --> 37:23.616
I beg your pardon. Lord Leopold, may I?

37:24.575 --> 37:25.910
Yes, of course, my dear.

37:26.327 --> 37:29.288
If all the infrastructure projects
are happening in Aldovia

37:29.372 --> 37:30.706
through Aldovian companies,

37:30.790 --> 37:33.084
how can the country
be losing so much money?

37:34.043 --> 37:37.421
Did you think that perhaps we should
consider taking some proactive steps

37:37.505 --> 37:38.381
to find out?

37:38.839 --> 37:41.133
Absolutely we should, and will.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.261
A thorough review begins tomorrow.

37:47.473 --> 37:48.808
To Lord Leopold!

37:49.141 --> 37:51.894
May the holidays shine that much brighter
now that he's here.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.188
-Lord Leopold!
-To King Richard!

37:54.272 --> 37:56.107
And the beautiful, charming Ms. Amber.

37:56.190 --> 37:58.526
[Rudy] Oh! [laughs]

37:58.609 --> 38:02.530
You are as blessed as your father, sir,
to have such a wise queen at your side.

38:03.406 --> 38:05.241
I had heard so many wonderful things
about you,

38:05.324 --> 38:08.452
yet somehow you seem to exceed
every expectation.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.037
Does the same thing to me.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.498
And I've known her all her life. [laughs]

38:12.873 --> 38:14.292
[Leopold laughs]

38:14.375 --> 38:17.336
[laughs] Hey, I like this guy.
Has a good sense of humor.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.046
Indeed he does, sir.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.173
I trust your meeting went well?

38:21.590 --> 38:23.801
Not sure this is the time or place, Simon.

38:23.884 --> 38:25.511
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

38:25.594 --> 38:28.347
I love our country
and was merely curious to know

38:28.431 --> 38:31.017
how Lord Leopold accounts
for the inverse returns

38:31.100 --> 38:33.060
on our New Aldovia initiatives.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.729
Ignore my cousin, Lord Leopold.

38:34.812 --> 38:35.855
[Leopold] No, not at all.

38:35.938 --> 38:38.190
-He'll be a good practice for you, sir.
-How so?

38:38.274 --> 38:41.527
Well, as King, you'll find everyone
has their own agenda.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.988
Keep a watchful eye
on those who try to lead you astray.

38:44.071 --> 38:45.281
I take offence to that.

38:45.698 --> 38:47.033
I take offence to you.

38:47.450 --> 38:48.409
Emily.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.496
I think what Lord Leopold
has to say is very true.

38:52.830 --> 38:55.833
I have no doubt
that Aldovia's future is secure.

38:56.459 --> 38:57.543
Thank you, sir.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.796
I do believe our fortunes
are about to change.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.131
[Rudy] Oh.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.343
It's snowing!

39:06.260 --> 39:09.221
Fresh snow at Christmas
is an Aldovian sign of good fortune.

39:09.305 --> 39:12.641
A signal from your father, no doubt,
that all will be well in the kingdom.

39:12.725 --> 39:13.684
Indeed.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.645
In time to save
my Christmas play tomorrow?

39:17.355 --> 39:18.439
I'll do my best.

39:18.939 --> 39:20.608
The strike will end.

39:21.108 --> 39:24.153
And if you don't do your play this year,
I'll make sure it happens next year.

39:27.281 --> 39:29.116
-Mr. Zabala?
-Yes, Miss?

39:29.200 --> 39:31.952
Would I be able to ask you a favor?
It's a pretty big favor.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.245
Of course, Miss.

39:33.329 --> 39:35.122
[whispers indistinctly]

39:37.375 --> 39:38.667
I would be honored.

39:42.838 --> 39:44.548
[classical fanfare plays]

39:56.394 --> 39:57.478
[horse snorts]

40:03.067 --> 40:04.402
It's amazing.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.946
I thought you might prefer
this mode of transport.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.740
But sleighs can get chilly.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.117
Thank you.

40:13.202 --> 40:15.663
Now, let's go and find
the most perfect Christmas tree

40:15.746 --> 40:17.832
that the palace courtyard has ever seen.

40:53.659 --> 40:55.661
[Amber] Oh, this is perfect.

40:57.037 --> 40:58.289
-Thank you.
-[Richard] Mm-hmm.

40:58.789 --> 41:00.458
What about this one?

41:01.167 --> 41:02.835
It's a little bare on the side.

41:04.086 --> 41:05.087
This one's nice.

41:06.088 --> 41:08.591
-It's not really a cone, is it?
-What?

41:09.049 --> 41:12.428
Well, a Christmas tree should be a cone.
That was more of a triangle.

41:12.511 --> 41:15.097
Well, I always thought a cone
was a sort of triangle.

41:15.181 --> 41:18.100
Finding the perfect tree
is like finding the perfect man.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.268
It takes time.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.854
And first Impressions can be deceiving.

41:22.396 --> 41:25.065
Oh, I see. Just because
I stole your taxi a year ago

41:25.149 --> 41:28.360
now means I need to freeze to death
while we find a perfect tree?

41:29.653 --> 41:31.614
No geometrical imperfections here.

41:32.281 --> 41:33.199
This one?

41:34.492 --> 41:35.326
Yes.

41:35.993 --> 41:36.827
No.

41:36.911 --> 41:40.581
-Tall, majestic, really the perfect tree.
-Totally wrong.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.167
Are you sure this isn't the one?

41:46.879 --> 41:47.922
Come on.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.758
That's-- that's a runt.

41:50.841 --> 41:54.386
I mean, it's missing branches. It looks
more like a tetrahedron than a cone.

41:54.470 --> 41:55.554
It's unique.

41:56.514 --> 41:57.598
Unique?

41:57.932 --> 41:59.058
It's special.

42:00.226 --> 42:01.310
This is the one.

42:03.604 --> 42:04.730
As you wish.

42:09.777 --> 42:11.695
[holiday fanfare plays]

42:13.739 --> 42:17.201
Wow, that's a very... unique tree.

42:17.284 --> 42:18.827
Exactly. It's perfect, right?

42:19.703 --> 42:21.747
[Rudy] It'll look great
once we get the colored lights

42:21.830 --> 42:23.749
and those big, old, inflatable reindeer
up there.

42:23.832 --> 42:24.959
When are we decorating?

42:26.794 --> 42:28.379
The staff will attend to that.

42:29.213 --> 42:32.383
And as things have gone back to normal
with the crown this year,

42:32.758 --> 42:34.677
we will light the tree Christmas Eve,

42:34.760 --> 42:36.011
after the King's address.

42:36.095 --> 42:37.096
That's okay.

42:37.179 --> 42:39.390
Reindeer don't fly
till Christmas Eve anyway.

42:40.015 --> 42:42.726
The decor mandate is white and gold.

42:43.227 --> 42:44.937
No inflatables.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.065
You're about to be Queen.
Thought maybe you might have a say.

42:48.148 --> 42:50.985
I'm pretty sure they'd rather treat me
as an ornament myself.

42:51.068 --> 42:53.070
Richard, Amber, Emily!

42:53.153 --> 42:54.113
[Leopold] Your Majesty!

42:54.196 --> 42:57.449
-You're late! You're very late.
-[Richard] Late for what, Mother?

42:57.533 --> 42:59.660
An important pact we made a year ago.

42:59.743 --> 43:01.203
Are thoseÂ toboggans?

43:06.417 --> 43:08.127
-Ready?
-That's it, kiddo!

43:08.210 --> 43:09.044
[Amber screams]

43:09.128 --> 43:10.796
-No!
-We're gonna go faster.

43:10.879 --> 43:11.922
Oh, my goodness.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.841
-Richard!
-[Richard laughs]

43:14.300 --> 43:17.469
Please, Your Majesty. I beg you, slower.

43:17.553 --> 43:19.388
[laughing]

43:19.471 --> 43:20.514
Faster!

43:20.598 --> 43:21.682
You're crazy.

43:21.765 --> 43:24.476
[Emily screaming, Rudy laughing]

43:24.560 --> 43:26.061
Whoa!

43:26.145 --> 43:27.563
[laughing]

43:27.646 --> 43:29.315
[screaming and laughing]

43:29.398 --> 43:30.357
Faster!

43:30.441 --> 43:31.734
[laughing]

43:32.401 --> 43:34.069
-Here we go!
-[Mr. Zabala] Oh!

43:36.822 --> 43:38.532
[keyboard keys clacking]

43:46.081 --> 43:47.666
I can see your reflection.

43:49.543 --> 43:51.545
You don't care for tobogganing?

43:52.296 --> 43:54.840
Not anymore than I care
for you spying on me.

43:55.382 --> 43:58.093
I call it looking after
the interests of Aldovia.

43:58.177 --> 43:59.845
Or for one Aldovian.

44:00.971 --> 44:02.014
Named Simon.

44:02.389 --> 44:04.099
Yes, I get it.

44:04.183 --> 44:05.476
It's not that clever.

44:05.559 --> 44:08.270
King Richard may have been taken in
by your little act.

44:08.979 --> 44:09.980
I'm not.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.442
[keyboard keys clacking]

44:13.525 --> 44:14.568
[laughing]

44:15.277 --> 44:17.029
[Rudy] Come on, bigger wings, kiddo.

44:17.112 --> 44:18.864
-I'm trying!
-Angel's gotta fly!

44:19.198 --> 44:20.699
Hey, you need more snow.

44:22.451 --> 44:24.453
-You messed with the wrong girl!
-Don't!

44:24.536 --> 44:25.704
[Rudy laughs]

44:25.788 --> 44:28.749
Your father's a miracle worker,
cheering her up like that.

44:29.583 --> 44:30.793
[camera shutter clicks]

44:32.878 --> 44:34.713
[Emily] Your father is a true menace.

44:34.797 --> 44:36.632
He is brutal with those snowballs.

44:37.007 --> 44:39.009
But I know what he's trying to do.
All of you.

44:39.093 --> 44:42.221
Trying to make me forget that I'm meant
to be starring in the Christmas play today

44:42.304 --> 44:43.639
-with Tom.
-Did it work?

44:43.722 --> 44:44.932
I won't allow it to.

44:45.015 --> 44:47.184
I have every right
to feel sorry for myself.

44:49.186 --> 44:50.729
Why is my costume here?

44:58.612 --> 45:00.406
You moved my play to the palace.

45:00.489 --> 45:01.782
How did you do this?

45:03.534 --> 45:04.743
[Mr. Zabala laughs]

Sure.

48:28.614 --> 48:31.325
and the Aldovian saga
of Princess Froon and the Wicked Ogre

48:31.408 --> 48:35.746
melted hearts and sparked a wild frenzy
of sweet treats and cocoa in the kitchen.

48:36.830 --> 48:37.998
It was a wonderful day,

48:38.081 --> 48:42.753
a great release from the pressure I feel
as my life is about to change forever.

48:50.218 --> 48:52.304
[Andy] Kingdom of Aldovia, here we come!

48:52.387 --> 48:53.639
[horn honks]

48:53.972 --> 48:55.599
We're on our way to the airport!

48:55.682 --> 48:59.394
Try and get some sleep on the plane, okay?
So you're not totally jet-lagged.

48:59.478 --> 49:02.230
I'm on vacation.
I'll sleep after New Year's.

49:02.314 --> 49:05.484
Your blog is out of control.
We're loving it.

49:05.567 --> 49:10.113
But why did you take down all the snow,
and play, and food fight pics?

49:10.530 --> 49:11.698
What are you talking about?

49:11.782 --> 49:14.576
Everything you put up
is, like, totally gone.

49:14.826 --> 49:16.578
Vanished about an hour ago.

49:16.662 --> 49:18.956
-I didn't take it down.
-Someone did.

49:20.332 --> 49:21.333
[exhales]

49:21.667 --> 49:22.960
I bet I know who.

49:23.877 --> 49:26.046
May I suggest a little damage control?

49:26.338 --> 49:28.840
I shall have a word
with my friends in the press.

49:28.924 --> 49:30.217
Much appreciated.

49:30.509 --> 49:31.593
Mrs. Averill,

49:31.969 --> 49:34.930
you are aware
Sahil requires promptness, hmm?

49:35.013 --> 49:39.017
So perhaps you can tell me where,
oh, where can Sahil find the bride-to-be?

49:39.601 --> 49:40.769
She hasn't arrived?

49:41.645 --> 49:42.646
She has not.

49:42.938 --> 49:44.856
Sahil, may I strongly suggest

49:44.940 --> 49:47.317
that you get a better handle
on our young queen.

49:47.734 --> 49:50.404
-Better know who's in charge.
-[Amber] I can hear you.

49:50.487 --> 49:53.115
Miss Moore, it is imperative
you adhere to the schedule.

49:53.198 --> 49:54.658
Did you censor my blog?

49:55.367 --> 49:56.910
With all due respect,

49:56.994 --> 49:59.746
I thought we had talked about this,
and agreed that--

49:59.830 --> 50:01.832
I never agreedÂ to my work being censored.

50:02.499 --> 50:04.334
Do you really think that this

50:04.793 --> 50:07.879
is the sort of image
the royal family should portray?

50:08.296 --> 50:11.925
I saw that it's trending-- It was trending
with tons of positive comments.

50:12.759 --> 50:14.970
It's also a breach of protocol.

50:15.053 --> 50:17.055
I seriously doubt
that traditional protocols

50:17.139 --> 50:19.725
were set up for viral social media.

50:20.058 --> 50:21.226
Times change.

50:21.309 --> 50:23.061
Protocol does not.

50:23.145 --> 50:24.604
Well, in this case--

50:25.605 --> 50:28.066
Your image belongs to us now.

50:28.150 --> 50:30.360
-[Amber sighs]
-It's just the way that it is.

50:31.278 --> 50:32.112
Now,

50:32.487 --> 50:35.532
shall we turn our attention
to the royal portrait?

50:35.615 --> 50:39.411
It is to be rendered at 4:30 promptly.

50:52.716 --> 50:54.593
I can tell something's bothering you.

50:54.926 --> 50:57.345
-Can we talk about it?
-I don't know, can we?

50:57.929 --> 51:00.640
It seems like we need a royal decree
to go to the loo.

51:01.016 --> 51:02.684
Who's ruffled your feathers now?

51:03.643 --> 51:06.730
I had a rather unpleasant conversation
with Mrs. Averill today.

51:09.399 --> 51:11.443
I don't appreciate being controlled.

51:12.694 --> 51:13.820
It's a balancing act.

51:13.904 --> 51:16.823
At the end of a day, they work for us.
But we need to play by the rules.

51:17.365 --> 51:20.160
She deleted posts from my blog,
without informing me.

51:20.243 --> 51:23.705
Ah-ah-ah. Stop your chattering, mmm?

51:24.623 --> 51:26.750
It will disrupt the make-up.

51:35.926 --> 51:38.929
Once we get through the wedding
and you're officially Queen,

51:39.513 --> 51:41.306
we'll be at a better place
to pick our battles.

51:41.807 --> 51:43.058
"Once we get through it."

51:43.558 --> 51:45.811
Sounds like you're talking
about a medical procedure.

51:45.894 --> 51:49.815
Let's just go with the flow.
Keep calm and carry on, for now. Okay?

51:57.364 --> 51:59.282
I spent all night cleaning up.

52:00.909 --> 52:01.868
Forgive me.

52:02.911 --> 52:04.121
I do not forgive.

52:05.122 --> 52:07.457
But since you bring flowers,
put them in water.

52:08.542 --> 52:10.377
No sense killing flowers.

52:11.002 --> 52:13.255
I got carried away
with the holiday spirit.

52:14.172 --> 52:15.757
The kids had so much fun.

52:17.926 --> 52:18.885
Um...

52:18.969 --> 52:20.178
Sorry I made you cry.

52:24.933 --> 52:27.102
When I was a child, life was not easy.

52:29.604 --> 52:32.607
Spending time with my family
in the kitchen for Christmas...

52:33.608 --> 52:35.235
are best memories I have.

52:39.030 --> 52:41.074
They were tears of nostalgia, not anger.

52:42.492 --> 52:45.078
I could never be angry
for bringing joy to children.

52:45.162 --> 52:47.664
That is so good to hear.

52:50.208 --> 52:51.835
I need small dice these peppers.

52:54.045 --> 52:56.256
And then maybe we can try
make the diner food.

52:56.339 --> 52:58.175
Ohh.

52:58.258 --> 53:00.844
[laughs]

53:06.057 --> 53:08.852
Splendid, you look absolutely regal.

53:08.935 --> 53:09.936
Indeed.

53:10.020 --> 53:12.314
Well done. They're in your capable hands.

53:13.899 --> 53:15.650
Chin up, King Richard.

53:16.151 --> 53:18.236
Give me some power, huh.

53:18.528 --> 53:19.738
Some "boom."

53:20.447 --> 53:21.573
More. Boom!

53:22.449 --> 53:24.201
Bigger. Boom!

53:25.160 --> 53:27.370
Boom, huh? Yes, very good. I like it.

53:27.454 --> 53:29.289
[Mrs. Averill] Watch the smiling.

53:29.581 --> 53:34.794
I mean, this image, it has to exude
solemnity and control.

53:35.587 --> 53:38.757
I would be exuding something else
if this dress was any tighter.

53:40.133 --> 53:42.010
-It's just not working.
-[Sahil] Mmm.

53:42.093 --> 53:44.763
I think there's something wrong
with her face, huh.

53:45.388 --> 53:47.015
Maybe the other side is better.

53:47.098 --> 53:49.643
Ms. Moore, could you turn to the left?

53:50.685 --> 53:51.603
A bit more.

53:52.020 --> 53:52.854
Down.

53:53.313 --> 53:54.147
Right.

53:54.689 --> 53:55.565
No, left.

53:56.024 --> 53:56.942
No, right.

53:58.652 --> 53:59.778
It's not working.

54:00.487 --> 54:02.155
How much longer will this take?

54:02.239 --> 54:04.491
The sooner we get it right,
the sooner we can go.

54:04.574 --> 54:05.450
[gasps]

54:06.785 --> 54:08.078
It's the necklace.

54:09.663 --> 54:11.164
Who approved this?

54:11.248 --> 54:12.165
Oh.

54:12.249 --> 54:13.083
I chose it.

54:13.166 --> 54:16.378
Well, it's absolutely wrong!
Get her a proper one, now!

54:16.962 --> 54:19.881
-I really want to wear this one.
-[Mrs. Averill] It's inappropriate.

54:19.965 --> 54:20.840
Quick.

54:23.260 --> 54:24.719
Yes.

54:26.596 --> 54:28.390
Now this, mmm...

54:28.682 --> 54:31.351
This will tie it all together.

54:31.434 --> 54:34.688
-No, I really think--
-No. It's not about you.

54:35.230 --> 54:38.400
This is about the official royal portrait.

54:38.942 --> 54:39.901
Richard...

54:40.360 --> 54:42.153
Mrs. Averill, is there really no way--

54:42.237 --> 54:44.990
This necklace is part of the Crown Jewels.
I mean...

54:45.657 --> 54:48.952
Do you really want to insult the crown,
Miss Moore?

54:56.042 --> 54:57.168
[owl hooting]

54:57.252 --> 55:00.046
["Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" plays]

55:01.172 --> 55:03.842
"It makes us proud to have you
as our royal family.

55:04.509 --> 55:08.054
May you be blessed
with the happiest of Christmases.

55:08.680 --> 55:10.348
Love, the Frosts."

55:10.807 --> 55:14.728
All the cards from well-wishers
have to be my favorite part of the season.

55:14.811 --> 55:15.687
Thank you.

55:15.770 --> 55:18.732
Hmm, I'd say the second best.
Presents, for me.

55:19.190 --> 55:20.525
I do the same thing.

55:20.608 --> 55:23.320
Oh, hang cards all around my kitchen
at the diner.

55:23.403 --> 55:24.237
[Simon laughs]

55:24.988 --> 55:28.867
Nothing could be finer
than Christmas in a diner.

55:30.201 --> 55:32.537
Would you like some coffee
with that whiskey, Simon?

55:34.748 --> 55:35.874
"Dear Royals,

55:36.666 --> 55:39.878
while I'm sure you're having
a dandy Christmas at the palace,

55:40.295 --> 55:43.089
the real working people of Aldovia
are suffering..."

55:46.676 --> 55:48.178
This one isn't very festive.

55:49.346 --> 55:50.555
Keep reading, Mother.

55:53.224 --> 55:54.309
"I've lost my job,

55:54.392 --> 55:58.063
as the company I worked for my whole life
was put out of business

55:58.146 --> 56:00.607
by your 'New Aldovia' disaster.

56:01.983 --> 56:06.196
Thanks for nothing but a big lump of coal
in our stocking this year.

56:07.113 --> 56:08.031
Bah, humbug."

56:10.408 --> 56:12.869
We are doing everything we can,

56:13.244 --> 56:14.204
aren't we?

56:14.287 --> 56:16.331
That man has no idea
how hard we're working

56:16.414 --> 56:18.500
for the long-term well-being
of the kingdom.

56:18.583 --> 56:20.585
[Rudy] Some people just like to complain.

56:20.668 --> 56:22.253
It's like I always say,

56:22.337 --> 56:24.631
"Can't let the naysayers bring you down."

56:25.006 --> 56:25.840
Right, Peanut?

56:26.383 --> 56:27.300
Pop!

56:28.051 --> 56:30.637
All hail, Princess Peanut!

56:31.137 --> 56:33.723
All hail, the village idiot.

56:34.099 --> 56:36.184
[Leopold] Mister Moore has a valid point.

56:36.518 --> 56:39.646
Mustn't let a malcontent
disrupt the season.

56:40.605 --> 56:41.856
Read another one, Mother.

56:44.901 --> 56:46.569
"Dearest royal family,

56:47.237 --> 56:49.781
sending you warmest wishes this holiday...

56:50.698 --> 56:52.158
and hoping for the best.

56:53.368 --> 56:54.702
Merry Christmas."

56:59.666 --> 57:00.917
How do you do that?

57:01.376 --> 57:02.252
It's easy.

57:04.838 --> 57:08.925
You just have to focus on what's important
and not let anything else distract you.

57:12.554 --> 57:14.139
You're absolutely right.

57:14.222 --> 57:15.473
Then take a shot.

57:16.057 --> 57:18.143
No, I mean, you're right about...

57:18.893 --> 57:20.437
not getting distracted.

57:21.521 --> 57:24.399
I've sensed there's more
to these New Aldovia problems,

57:24.482 --> 57:27.735
but I've been too caught up
thinking about the wedding protocols.

57:28.862 --> 57:30.238
What do you mean "more"?

57:30.321 --> 57:32.073
Call it journalistic instinct.

57:33.158 --> 57:35.785
I just have to focus on the target.

57:35.869 --> 57:38.204
-Clear your mind and aim.
-Amber!

57:39.038 --> 57:40.748
Amber, hey! We're here!

57:40.832 --> 57:41.791
[gasps]

57:44.210 --> 57:45.128
[gasps]

57:45.211 --> 57:46.337
I-I'm so sorry.

57:47.338 --> 57:49.257
Well, that was a real royal welcome.

57:49.716 --> 57:50.633
Hey!

57:52.343 --> 57:53.970
-Hey!
-[laughing] Hey!

57:55.221 --> 57:57.015
You must be Princess Emily.

57:57.599 --> 57:59.976
It's an honor to be a guest of the realm.

58:00.560 --> 58:04.481
Uh, excuse Andy,
this is his first royal wedding.

58:04.564 --> 58:05.815
I'm Melissa.

58:06.274 --> 58:07.692
The realm welcomes you both.

58:07.942 --> 58:09.861
Abide, and you will avoid the dungeon.

58:12.697 --> 58:14.282
Guys, there's no dungeon.

58:14.616 --> 58:16.451
[all laugh]

58:17.660 --> 58:19.662
[bell tolls faintly in background]

58:20.497 --> 58:23.416
Oh, my gosh, can you believe this place?
It's amazing.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.460
You think if we just moved in,
they'd even notice?

58:25.543 --> 58:26.794
Let's give it a try.

58:26.878 --> 58:30.006
-Where are the knights in shining armor?
-When's jousting? I want to joust.

58:30.089 --> 58:32.884
-I want wenches serving mead.
-There are no wenches in my kingdom.

58:32.967 --> 58:33.801
Richard!

58:33.885 --> 58:34.719
-My King!
-Hello!

58:34.802 --> 58:36.930
-Good to see you again.
-Good to see you, too. Hello.

58:37.013 --> 58:38.014
-Hello.
-Hello.

58:38.097 --> 58:40.600
Oh, um, let me introduce you
to the Prime Minister.

58:40.683 --> 58:43.978
Uh, Andy, Melissa,
this is Prime Minister Denzill.

58:44.562 --> 58:46.814
Welcome. It is wonderful
to have you in our country.

58:46.898 --> 58:48.274
You have a beautiful country, sir.

58:48.358 --> 58:51.653
Sir, it's an honor. I never get to meet
dignitaries at the Noodle Chalet.

58:52.028 --> 58:54.113
I wish I could come have some fun
with you three today,

58:54.197 --> 58:56.241
but sadly, my day is far from over.

58:56.324 --> 58:58.159
Lord Leopold has
the new accounts for us.

58:58.243 --> 59:01.079
-I wish I could come with. I miss you.
-I miss you too.

59:02.914 --> 59:05.792
Unfortunately, the Prime Minister and I
have meetings to attend.

59:05.875 --> 59:08.670
But think of me when you're having fun.

59:08.753 --> 59:10.964
We shall celebrate in your honor,
King Richard.

59:11.047 --> 59:12.048
[Richard chuckles]

59:13.258 --> 59:14.676
You heard the King, it's party time.

59:14.759 --> 59:17.136
It's your bachelorette night!
We're gonna get it going!

59:17.220 --> 59:19.681
Actually, there's something I was hoping
you could help me with.

59:19.764 --> 59:20.807
What kind of something?

59:20.890 --> 59:23.351
-A lead I wanna follow up on.
-A lead?

59:23.851 --> 59:25.687
More of a hunch. Potentially a source.

59:25.770 --> 59:26.771
Wait, for what?

59:27.146 --> 59:29.274
Discrepancies in the kingdom's finances.

59:29.357 --> 59:31.818
That sounds way more fun
than a bachelorette party.

59:31.901 --> 59:33.069
Should've seen this coming.

59:33.152 --> 59:34.821
It's two days before your wedding,

59:34.904 --> 59:37.448
your best friends just flew halfway
around the world to celebrate,

59:37.532 --> 59:38.533
and you want to work?

59:38.616 --> 59:41.578
Yes. There's something going on
in Aldovia that doesn't make sense.

59:41.661 --> 59:42.870
What does Richard say?

59:42.954 --> 59:45.081
He's too busy going with the flow.

59:45.164 --> 59:46.624
Please, I need your help.

59:47.292 --> 59:49.294
There's someone we need to find tonight.

59:50.086 --> 59:51.963
It's gonna be a bit of a mission.

59:54.799 --> 59:57.427
Be quite. We don't want them to see us.

59:58.344 --> 1:00:01.347
-The guest list, per your request.
-Thank you, Mr. Little.

1:00:02.849 --> 1:00:03.683
Oh.

1:00:04.017 --> 1:00:05.059
No.

1:00:05.143 --> 1:00:06.686
No, cross her off.

1:00:08.563 --> 1:00:10.023
-Oh, I don't think--
-[door closes]

1:00:17.155 --> 1:00:17.989
Come on.

1:00:19.991 --> 1:00:20.908
This one.

1:00:23.828 --> 1:00:26.164
[footsteps approaching]

1:00:43.264 --> 1:00:44.474
Does it say who said it?

1:00:44.557 --> 1:00:46.059
Mr. Ernest Mason.

1:00:46.142 --> 1:00:48.519
Let us search the realm
for one Earnest Mason.

1:00:52.273 --> 1:00:54.233
[Andy] Your outfit's very incognito.

1:00:54.317 --> 1:00:56.361
Having the Queen-to-be
spotted in a place like this

1:00:56.444 --> 1:00:58.321
would not be in keepimg
with royal protocol.

1:00:58.404 --> 1:01:01.574
If this Ernest guy isn't here,
can we please do something fun?

1:01:01.658 --> 1:01:03.660
Yes, something that resembles
a bachelorette party.

1:01:03.743 --> 1:01:05.161
I spoke to his wife on the phone,

1:01:05.244 --> 1:01:08.081
she said that he's been here
almost every day since he lost his job.

1:01:08.164 --> 1:01:10.416
Notice how she didn't answer my question.

1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:11.876
Well, at least it's a bar.

1:01:13.294 --> 1:01:15.463
["We Wish You a Merry Christmas" plays]

1:01:23.304 --> 1:01:24.639
Go ask theÂ  bartender.

1:01:31.229 --> 1:01:34.190
Oh, honey. Honey, please...

1:01:34.273 --> 1:01:36.150
Merry Christmas, lass.

1:01:36.234 --> 1:01:38.695
It's darker than a dungeon in here.

1:01:38.778 --> 1:01:41.614
Why prevent us from the light
of your pretty, pretty eyes?

1:01:41.698 --> 1:01:43.533
I have a light sensitivity disorder.

1:01:44.951 --> 1:01:47.829
Do I know your voice from somewhere?

1:01:47.912 --> 1:01:49.414
I gotta go, sorry.

1:01:49.497 --> 1:01:50.540
Merry Christmas.

1:01:55.586 --> 1:01:57.213
Walter!

1:02:03.803 --> 1:02:05.346
-Ernest Mason?
-[sighs]

1:02:05.430 --> 1:02:06.597
Who wants to know?

1:02:06.681 --> 1:02:09.642
We have a friend here who'd love
to ask you some questions.

1:02:10.017 --> 1:02:12.603
-What kind of questions?
-About your work situation.

1:02:13.688 --> 1:02:15.064
You some kind of reporter?

1:02:15.148 --> 1:02:17.400
No, but she is.

1:02:25.199 --> 1:02:27.827
First off, you're wrong about the royals.
They do care.

1:02:27.910 --> 1:02:30.121
King Richard has barely slept
since I got here.

1:02:30.204 --> 1:02:32.165
[scoffs] And I'm supposed
to feel sorry for him?

1:02:32.248 --> 1:02:33.875
How much sleep you think
I've been getting?

1:02:33.958 --> 1:02:35.752
I'm sorry, Mr. Mason,
that's not what I meant.

1:02:35.835 --> 1:02:39.255
It's just that they-- that we are all
trying to find the best solution.

1:02:39.338 --> 1:02:41.174
But you're one of them.
Why should I trust you?

1:02:41.257 --> 1:02:44.427
Why else would I be here?
I want to understand what's going on, too.

1:02:44.510 --> 1:02:47.138
This whole "New Aldovia" initiative,

1:02:47.221 --> 1:02:49.348
-it's a fraud.
-It was supposed to be a way

1:02:49.432 --> 1:02:51.601
to get the country
to invest more money back into itself.

1:02:51.684 --> 1:02:54.437
That be the case, the money
should actually stay in Aldovia.

1:02:54.854 --> 1:02:59.233
I was a foreman for Derryville Concrete
for 25 years before we were shut down.

1:02:59.317 --> 1:03:02.445
If companies like yours aren't getting
a piece of the pie, then who is?

1:03:02.528 --> 1:03:04.739
Well, a new company, Meadowlark.

1:03:05.198 --> 1:03:07.283
They absorbed
all the contracts in our zone.

1:03:07.366 --> 1:03:09.202
I even heard their bids
were higher than ours.

1:03:09.285 --> 1:03:10.495
An Aldovian company?

1:03:10.578 --> 1:03:12.288
Well, on paper, maybe.

1:03:12.371 --> 1:03:14.916
But my boss said that them
and another couple of companies

1:03:14.999 --> 1:03:16.959
formed at the start of the initiative.

1:03:17.043 --> 1:03:18.377
All a bit fishy, if you ask me.

1:03:19.253 --> 1:03:22.089
-What are you planning on doingÂ anyway?
-Getting to the bottom of this.

1:03:22.173 --> 1:03:24.425
Thank you for your help, Mr. Mason.
It's a good start.

1:03:24.509 --> 1:03:25.760
Call me Ernie, Your Highness.

1:03:25.843 --> 1:03:28.054
-There she is! With the hat!
-Amb? I think we got trouble.

1:03:28.137 --> 1:03:29.472
-Amber, Amber!
-Oh, no.

1:03:29.555 --> 1:03:31.015
-What do we do now?
-We're trapped.

1:03:31.098 --> 1:03:32.683
Follow me. I know a way out.

1:03:32.767 --> 1:03:35.102
Or, you can stay here
and be picked clean by the vultures.

1:03:35.186 --> 1:03:37.688
What-- You tipped these people off,
didn't you?

1:03:37.772 --> 1:03:40.566
If I tipped them off, why would I be
trying to help you escape? Let's go.

1:03:40.650 --> 1:03:41.859
-You with us?
-Yeah.

1:03:42.443 --> 1:03:43.694
-Come on.
-Thank you.

1:03:44.487 --> 1:03:46.322
Long live the Queen!

1:03:49.575 --> 1:03:52.537
-Did you follow us here?
-We're fighting on the same side here.

1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:55.289
I don't know what angle you're
playing, but I know you're playing one.

1:03:55.373 --> 1:03:56.624
This is my car, come on.

1:03:58.000 --> 1:03:58.960
[door squeaks open]

1:03:59.043 --> 1:04:00.878
-Get in!
-What happened to the Lamborghini?

1:04:00.962 --> 1:04:02.547
Ferrari. Don't ask.

1:04:05.258 --> 1:04:06.384
[door squeaks open]

1:04:08.302 --> 1:04:09.595
[engine struggles, turns on]

1:04:09.679 --> 1:04:10.721
All right, let's go.

1:04:16.519 --> 1:04:19.313
Not much on Meadowlark Enterprises.

1:04:19.397 --> 1:04:22.316
Just a public web site
with no physical address.

1:04:23.901 --> 1:04:27.196
It's like someone's scrubbed the records.
There's no footprint.

1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:28.823
Is that the best you can do?

1:04:29.490 --> 1:04:31.033
Remind me again why you're here?

1:04:31.117 --> 1:04:33.995
Hello? He saved your ass
from the paparazzi?

1:04:34.078 --> 1:04:35.872
You really have a way with words.

1:04:35.955 --> 1:04:37.748
Well, I am a writer.

1:04:38.416 --> 1:04:39.625
Hey, check that out.

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:42.211
Looks like Meadowlark is getting
the lion's share of the contracts

1:04:42.295 --> 1:04:43.337
with these two other firms:

1:04:43.421 --> 1:04:45.423
Geller Inc., and Houghton Alexis.

1:04:45.506 --> 1:04:47.633
Those must be the others
that Ernie was talking about.

1:04:47.717 --> 1:04:50.177
Do you know anything
about those companies?

1:04:50.261 --> 1:04:53.723
No, but I do know that any company
involved in public works projects

1:04:53.806 --> 1:04:55.433
has to register
their financial information

1:04:55.516 --> 1:04:57.143
with the Hall of Records database.

1:04:57.226 --> 1:04:58.644
How do we get in there?

1:04:58.728 --> 1:05:00.521
You're the one with the King for a fiance.

1:05:00.605 --> 1:05:03.733
I don't want to ask Richard about this.
Not unless I really have to.

1:05:03.816 --> 1:05:04.650
Why not?

1:05:04.734 --> 1:05:06.611
Do I detect trouble in paradise?

1:05:06.694 --> 1:05:08.946
Wipe that stupid look off your face.

1:05:09.447 --> 1:05:10.281
Um...

1:05:10.573 --> 1:05:12.825
We could break into the Hall of Records.

1:05:13.784 --> 1:05:15.453
Or kidnap the records keeper,

1:05:15.536 --> 1:05:17.955
toss him in a dungeon,
and hope he gives up the passcode.

1:05:18.039 --> 1:05:18.873
[Melissa laughs]

1:05:18.956 --> 1:05:20.791
Or you could leave it to me.

1:05:21.918 --> 1:05:23.669
How long have you been out there?

1:05:23.753 --> 1:05:25.338
Long enough to get the gist.

1:05:25.421 --> 1:05:29.175
Chances are Aldovia's public firewalls
aren't exactly state of the art.

1:05:29.258 --> 1:05:32.803
-And I know a thing or two about hacking.
-Are you saying you could get us in?

1:05:33.471 --> 1:05:34.347
Mm-hmm.

1:05:35.181 --> 1:05:36.766
Well, let Princess Emily get to work.

1:05:39.352 --> 1:05:40.978
If I can create a network interface

1:05:41.062 --> 1:05:43.314
that catches the traffic
to the legitimate server,

1:05:43.397 --> 1:05:44.649
I can backdoor the access.

1:05:44.732 --> 1:05:47.443
An interfacing server-traffic-catcher,
of course.

1:05:47.526 --> 1:05:48.986
So obvious.

1:05:49.070 --> 1:05:50.696
You think you can crack this?

1:05:50.780 --> 1:05:52.865
Yes, it's gonna take some time.

1:05:52.949 --> 1:05:53.991
Perhaps all night.

1:05:54.075 --> 1:05:54.951
No problem.

1:05:55.409 --> 1:05:58.245
-Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
-Bachelorette party?

1:05:58.329 --> 1:05:59.789
[rock music plays]

1:06:06.337 --> 1:06:07.755
[Melissa and Andy] To the bride!

1:06:07.838 --> 1:06:10.383
And may we all find
our own happily ever after.

1:06:12.802 --> 1:06:14.762
[all laugh]

1:06:17.348 --> 1:06:18.808
[classical music plays]

1:06:24.647 --> 1:06:26.649
[indistinct voice] Miss Moore. Miss Moore!

1:06:27.316 --> 1:06:29.151
Sahil, go away.

1:06:29.235 --> 1:06:31.153
[scoffs] I am not Sahil.

1:06:31.445 --> 1:06:33.155
Now, get up, get dressed,

1:06:33.239 --> 1:06:34.699
and follow me to my office.

1:06:40.037 --> 1:06:42.498
-Richard?
-Amber, what are you doing here?

1:06:42.999 --> 1:06:46.377
-I have no idea. You don't know?
-Not a clue. Mrs. Averill asked me here.

1:06:46.460 --> 1:06:48.087
Your Highness, thank you for coming.

1:06:48.170 --> 1:06:50.798
-What can we do for you?
-I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

1:06:50.881 --> 1:06:55.469
but we have been hit by a rather
severe public relations snafu.

1:06:55.553 --> 1:06:59.223
This is exactly what we don't want.

1:07:00.725 --> 1:07:03.561
That's absurd.
That's Amber's bachelorette party.

1:07:04.311 --> 1:07:05.354
Is that Simon?

1:07:06.522 --> 1:07:07.857
It wasn't a party.

1:07:08.899 --> 1:07:10.067
We were investigating.

1:07:10.568 --> 1:07:11.527
Investigating?

1:07:11.610 --> 1:07:13.154
Investigating what?

1:07:13.654 --> 1:07:15.990
The discrepancies in the royal finances.

1:07:16.532 --> 1:07:17.825
-Excuse me?
-What?

1:07:19.618 --> 1:07:21.537
I'm afraid that Ms. Moore

1:07:21.620 --> 1:07:25.124
does not understand her role
within the royal family.

1:07:25.207 --> 1:07:26.709
Oh, no, I get it.

1:07:27.001 --> 1:07:29.962
I'm supposed to smile, and nod,
and do as I'm told.

1:07:30.046 --> 1:07:31.422
I understand, I just--

1:07:32.048 --> 1:07:33.215
I don't agree.

1:07:33.299 --> 1:07:37.636
Well, I suggest that you cease
from any further investigation

1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:40.931
and any activity pertaining to your blog
immediately.

1:07:41.015 --> 1:07:42.099
No way.

1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:45.478
Your Majesty?

1:07:49.774 --> 1:07:50.775
Sir?

1:07:51.275 --> 1:07:52.151
I--

1:07:53.069 --> 1:07:54.987
-[Richard clears his throat]
-Really, Richard?

1:07:57.740 --> 1:07:59.700
-Amber! Amber!
-Sir! Sir!

1:08:02.536 --> 1:08:04.914
Give her some space. Let her calm down.

1:08:05.873 --> 1:08:11.670
And meanwhile, Lord Leopold has
sent some notes for tonight's speech.

1:08:17.384 --> 1:08:19.095
[keyboard keys clacking]

1:08:24.016 --> 1:08:24.975
Still at it?

1:08:25.643 --> 1:08:28.479
Not exactly Mr. Robot, are you?
More like Mr. Slowbot.

1:08:28.562 --> 1:08:30.606
Silence, Simon. I'm getting there.

1:08:30.689 --> 1:08:33.901
It takes a lot of work.
A concept quite foreign to you, I know.

1:08:34.276 --> 1:08:35.361
Anything we can do?

1:08:35.444 --> 1:08:38.322
Develop malware for me
to drop into their RDP.

1:08:38.405 --> 1:08:40.199
[keyboard keys clacking]

1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:42.701
Is Ms. Moore not here?

1:08:43.202 --> 1:08:44.245
I thought she would be.

1:08:44.745 --> 1:08:46.956
Well, if she's not here, where is she?

1:08:47.456 --> 1:08:49.125
She must be located!

1:08:49.625 --> 1:08:50.793
Sahil will find her.

1:08:53.295 --> 1:08:55.381
What are you doing there, Princess Emily?

1:08:56.465 --> 1:08:58.300
Showing Amber's friends my new game.

1:08:58.384 --> 1:08:59.301
Hmm.

1:08:59.885 --> 1:09:01.387
And you, Count Simon?

1:09:01.470 --> 1:09:03.764
Uh, I was just, um--

1:09:03.848 --> 1:09:05.349
He's bothering us.

1:09:05.766 --> 1:09:06.892
[chuckles awkwardly]

1:09:11.939 --> 1:09:13.482
[keyboard keys clacking]

1:09:13.566 --> 1:09:16.318
We'd all feel much better
if you could stay longer.

1:09:16.694 --> 1:09:19.321
I'd love to, but I'm afraid
I'm compelled to depart

1:09:19.405 --> 1:09:21.115
immediately following the wedding.

1:09:21.198 --> 1:09:22.992
I assure you, things will stabilize.

1:09:23.075 --> 1:09:25.119
Your Majesty, excuse me!

1:09:27.413 --> 1:09:28.998
Have you seen the Queen-to-be?

1:09:29.081 --> 1:09:30.374
She's missing.

1:09:38.674 --> 1:09:40.676
Your Majesty. How may I assist you?

1:09:40.759 --> 1:09:42.011
Amber is missing.

1:09:43.095 --> 1:09:45.681
Mrs. Averill indicated
that she would be in conference

1:09:45.764 --> 1:09:47.349
with Miss Moore this morning.

1:09:47.808 --> 1:09:49.852
And it was requested that I not attend.

1:09:49.935 --> 1:09:51.604
In conference, Mrs. Averill?

1:09:51.687 --> 1:09:54.315
Oh, it was a press and protocol issue.

1:09:54.398 --> 1:09:56.483
It was discussed and resolved.

1:09:56.567 --> 1:09:59.653
Well, subsequently, Miss Moore
did not show up for her fitting.

1:09:59.737 --> 1:10:02.865
Now, Sahil cannot create magic
with a run-away bride.

1:10:02.948 --> 1:10:06.202
Well, I sincerely hope
we won't have to cancel the wedding.

1:10:07.536 --> 1:10:08.871
Cancel the wedding?

1:10:09.622 --> 1:10:10.915
Who will wear the gown?

1:10:12.416 --> 1:10:13.334
Put an alert out!

1:10:14.084 --> 1:10:15.628
Ms. Moore is missing!

1:10:17.504 --> 1:10:18.923
Amber!

1:10:19.924 --> 1:10:21.133
[Queen Rayleen] Amber!

1:10:21.425 --> 1:10:22.760
[Mrs. Averill] Miss Moore!

1:10:23.010 --> 1:10:24.386
[Sahil] She has vanished!

1:10:24.762 --> 1:10:26.138
Amber!

1:10:29.975 --> 1:10:30.893
Richard.

1:10:30.976 --> 1:10:32.144
There's a situation.

1:10:32.228 --> 1:10:33.312
A calamity.

1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:41.153
I could always sniff out the name
of the record keeper's favorite pet.

1:10:41.237 --> 1:10:43.781
-Maybe that's the passcode.
-Gross oversimplification.

1:10:44.281 --> 1:10:47.576
-Did you try one, two, three, four, five?
-Zip it, Simple Simon!

1:10:48.577 --> 1:10:50.246
Look, I don't mean to beat a dead horse,

1:10:50.329 --> 1:10:51.956
-but the dungeon option--
-Shut up!

1:10:52.039 --> 1:10:52.873
[beeping]

1:10:52.957 --> 1:10:53.874
[computer chimes]

1:10:55.709 --> 1:10:56.835
What happened?

1:10:57.127 --> 1:10:58.212
We're in.

1:10:58.295 --> 1:10:59.338
We did it.

1:10:59.838 --> 1:11:02.424
[Melissa] What's it say
about those three companies?

1:11:02.675 --> 1:11:06.679
[Emily] Each are listed as a division
of this... Glockenspiel Consortium.

1:11:06.762 --> 1:11:07.721
Glockenspiel?

1:11:07.805 --> 1:11:09.139
What's that?

1:11:09.223 --> 1:11:11.058
It could be a parent company, or a shell,

1:11:11.141 --> 1:11:13.352
used to funnel the money
to a foreign entity.

1:11:13.894 --> 1:11:16.689
You have a disturbing knowledge
of underhanded activities.

1:11:16.772 --> 1:11:19.942
That would explain why so little
of the money's staying in Aldovia.

1:11:20.025 --> 1:11:23.153
Perhaps if we dig a little bit deeper
into Glockenspiel...

1:11:26.740 --> 1:11:27.783
Oh, my.

1:11:27.866 --> 1:11:28.951
I can't believe it.

1:11:29.451 --> 1:11:30.995
Would you look at that?

1:11:31.620 --> 1:11:33.580
Now is hardly the time to be smug.

1:11:37.793 --> 1:11:38.711
Amber?

1:11:38.794 --> 1:11:39.753
Amber!

1:11:41.505 --> 1:11:42.673
Amber, are you here?

1:11:44.008 --> 1:11:44.925
Amber!

1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:50.597
Amber.

1:11:50.681 --> 1:11:52.725
Amber, I'm so sorry,
I've been such a fool.

1:11:52.808 --> 1:11:54.518
You have no idea.

1:11:54.893 --> 1:11:55.811
Emily?

1:11:56.478 --> 1:11:59.732
-No idea about what?
-How much of a fool you really have been.

1:11:59.815 --> 1:12:03.027
If you're talking about how I've fallen
out with Amber, I have a pretty good idea.

1:12:03.110 --> 1:12:04.611
You've fallen out with Amber?

1:12:04.695 --> 1:12:06.030
Is that why she's missing?

1:12:06.530 --> 1:12:07.614
I'm afraid so.

1:12:08.198 --> 1:12:10.909
Just when she needed me most,
I caved in to the crown.

1:12:13.871 --> 1:12:15.247
After Father died...

1:12:16.123 --> 1:12:18.292
and you left us to go soul-searching,

1:12:18.625 --> 1:12:20.252
I was so angry with you...

1:12:20.336 --> 1:12:22.212
-Oh, Emily.
-...at first.

1:12:22.921 --> 1:12:25.466
But then I realized this life
we find ourselves in,

1:12:25.549 --> 1:12:27.718
the titles and responsibilities we bear,

1:12:28.135 --> 1:12:29.803
can overwhelm any person,

1:12:30.137 --> 1:12:31.764
especially a good-hearted one.

1:12:32.723 --> 1:12:34.433
And I've allowed it to happen.

1:12:34.767 --> 1:12:38.395
You accepted your title with eyes
wide open. With the best intent.

1:12:38.479 --> 1:12:41.482
-And that's the brother I love.
-I've made such a mess of everything.

1:12:41.565 --> 1:12:44.443
You're only guilty of being manipulated.
Horribly.

1:12:45.027 --> 1:12:46.695
I suspect you're too good to even see it.

1:12:47.071 --> 1:12:48.822
Are you telling me
you suspect Mrs. Averill

1:12:48.906 --> 1:12:51.325
of intentionally driving a wedge
between Amber and me?

1:12:51.408 --> 1:12:55.371
Her loyalty to protocol and history
may have unduly influenced her.

1:12:55.829 --> 1:12:58.832
But there are others in the palace
with even worse intentions.

1:12:59.666 --> 1:13:01.043
What are you talking about?

1:13:01.293 --> 1:13:03.712
Thanks to Amber,
we know where the money's going.

1:13:04.463 --> 1:13:06.298
[Richard] Don't do a thing
until I find Amber.

1:13:06.382 --> 1:13:08.092
There's only one place she can be.

1:13:10.052 --> 1:13:11.011
[horse snorts]

1:13:43.544 --> 1:13:44.420
Amber.

1:13:48.215 --> 1:13:49.550
I'm so sorry.

1:13:52.845 --> 1:13:53.804
Talk to me.

1:13:54.221 --> 1:13:55.472
Now you want to talk?

1:13:56.056 --> 1:13:59.643
You had nothing to say when I needed you
in Mrs. Averill's office.

1:14:00.227 --> 1:14:01.145
I know.

1:14:02.688 --> 1:14:05.023
They want me
to give up everything, Richard.

1:14:05.732 --> 1:14:07.109
My voice, my career.

1:14:07.192 --> 1:14:10.112
Forget about everyone else.
This should be about you and me.

1:14:10.696 --> 1:14:12.531
I always thought
that you would support me,

1:14:12.614 --> 1:14:14.658
and this week has just been so tough.

1:14:14.741 --> 1:14:17.411
-Amber, please--
-Just let me finish, okay?

1:14:18.162 --> 1:14:19.663
Everything is changing.

1:14:21.540 --> 1:14:23.542
I feel like I'm losing control and--

1:14:24.251 --> 1:14:28.464
I'm not used to living like this.
This fishbowl, this distance between us.

1:14:28.547 --> 1:14:30.048
I know it's hard, Amber.

1:14:31.300 --> 1:14:32.384
Trust me, I know.

1:14:34.094 --> 1:14:35.721
And everything is changing.

1:14:36.472 --> 1:14:37.556
For both of us.

1:14:38.724 --> 1:14:41.101
But there is one thing
that will never change...

1:14:43.312 --> 1:14:44.521
My love for you.

1:14:49.526 --> 1:14:52.029
I'll put you before the crown,
I'll put you before everything,

1:14:52.112 --> 1:14:55.782
but if you have to sacrifice
a single thing to be with me...

1:14:56.450 --> 1:14:58.785
your talent, your creativity...

1:14:59.161 --> 1:15:00.537
your determination...

1:15:02.831 --> 1:15:04.958
I don't think I could live with myself.

1:15:09.296 --> 1:15:10.756
I need you, Amber.

1:15:14.510 --> 1:15:16.261
And Aldovia needs you, too.

1:15:17.763 --> 1:15:19.723
We need to get back to the palace, now.

1:15:28.190 --> 1:15:29.358
Oh, Amber!

1:15:29.441 --> 1:15:30.859
Thank goodness.

1:15:31.985 --> 1:15:34.238
-Is everything all right?
-No, not at all.

1:15:37.533 --> 1:15:38.617
What's happened?

1:15:39.618 --> 1:15:42.746
Let's start with the wedding.
There are gonna be some changes.

1:15:42.829 --> 1:15:43.789
Changes?

1:15:43.872 --> 1:15:47.251
Yes, to protocol.
Everything, right down to the gown.

1:15:47.334 --> 1:15:48.418
[gasps]

1:15:48.502 --> 1:15:51.880
It's gonna be our wedding,
so Richard and I are taking it back.

1:15:52.422 --> 1:15:54.091
I don't think you understand.

1:15:54.550 --> 1:15:55.425
Go on.

1:15:56.969 --> 1:15:58.971
I know that it has to be grand,

1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:01.390
and royal, and magnificent,

1:16:01.473 --> 1:16:03.308
but it also has to be about us.

1:16:04.393 --> 1:16:05.561
And I'm half of us.

1:16:05.644 --> 1:16:07.437
So my gown,

1:16:07.771 --> 1:16:10.107
my shoes, my jewelry, and...

1:16:10.983 --> 1:16:12.150
my menu...

1:16:13.443 --> 1:16:14.820
prepared by my dad.

1:16:16.196 --> 1:16:18.073
With all due respect...

1:16:18.615 --> 1:16:20.450
this outburst here, now,

1:16:20.534 --> 1:16:22.536
on the eve before your wedding, it's--

1:16:22.619 --> 1:16:23.996
Long overdue.

1:16:24.788 --> 1:16:25.872
Amber is right.

1:16:27.499 --> 1:16:29.042
And I'm the worst offender.

1:16:29.710 --> 1:16:33.213
I got so caught up in the protocol,
the pomp, the ceremony,

1:16:33.297 --> 1:16:35.799
that I've lost sight
of what the wedding's really about.

1:16:36.842 --> 1:16:38.677
Christmas is about family.

1:16:41.888 --> 1:16:43.056
And your wedding...

1:16:43.724 --> 1:16:45.851
is about the love between you...

1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:47.436
and Richard.

1:16:48.604 --> 1:16:50.188
Everything else is secondary.

1:16:51.773 --> 1:16:53.358
Which means, Mrs. Averill,

1:16:53.442 --> 1:16:56.236
you will stop trying to disrupt
the Queen-to-be and her work.

1:16:56.320 --> 1:16:58.238
Protocol be damned.

1:16:58.322 --> 1:16:59.406
[Leopold] Here, here.

1:16:59.823 --> 1:17:02.909
And as long as the memory
of your dear father is respected,

1:17:02.993 --> 1:17:05.912
a little modernization
should be no threat to the monarchy.

1:17:06.705 --> 1:17:09.708
-To kings and queens--
-That's enough out of you.

1:17:10.250 --> 1:17:11.251
Richard?

1:17:13.003 --> 1:17:14.171
I'm sorry, Mother,

1:17:14.713 --> 1:17:16.632
but there is a threat to the monarchy.

1:17:17.341 --> 1:17:18.383
Lord Leopold.

1:17:18.467 --> 1:17:21.386
I'm sorry? What on earth do you mean?

1:17:21.470 --> 1:17:23.388
The New Aldovia initiative
has been failing

1:17:23.472 --> 1:17:25.432
because you've been
siphoning off the money.

1:17:25.515 --> 1:17:28.018
-That's absurd.
-People lost their jobs because of you.

1:17:29.019 --> 1:17:30.979
And you lied to our faces.

1:17:31.938 --> 1:17:33.482
You should be ashamed.

1:17:34.816 --> 1:17:36.860
I have an army of lawyers

1:17:37.444 --> 1:17:38.987
that shall right that slander.

1:17:48.038 --> 1:17:50.165
-[Amber] You're not going anywhere.
-[gasping]

1:17:55.128 --> 1:17:56.046
You wouldn't dare.

1:17:56.421 --> 1:17:58.590
She's deadly with that thing.

1:18:00.133 --> 1:18:01.593
You'll never prove anything!

1:18:01.677 --> 1:18:05.305
Then why do I hear the dulcet tones
of a glockenspiel?

1:18:05.389 --> 1:18:06.890
[glockenspiel chimes]

1:18:06.973 --> 1:18:10.394
As in Glockenspiel Consortium.

1:18:10.477 --> 1:18:12.979
Yes, yes, I get it. It's not that clever.

1:18:25.325 --> 1:18:26.201
Mr. Little.

1:18:27.452 --> 1:18:28.453
Mr. Zabala.

1:18:30.455 --> 1:18:32.457
Take Lord Leopold to the dungeon.

1:18:34.334 --> 1:18:35.502
There's actually a dungeon?

1:18:35.585 --> 1:18:37.170
Oh, yes, there's a dungeon.

1:18:37.879 --> 1:18:40.882
In the deepest, darkest depths
of the castle.

1:18:41.508 --> 1:18:42.509
Cool!

1:18:51.768 --> 1:18:53.395
[owl hoots]

1:18:53.478 --> 1:18:54.896
[Richard] Loyal Aldovians,

1:18:55.772 --> 1:18:58.150
I'm happy to announce
that I am able to tear up the script

1:18:58.233 --> 1:18:59.901
that I was given for tonight's speech,

1:19:00.569 --> 1:19:04.656
one which glossed over the hardships
that I know a lot of you have been facing.

1:19:11.329 --> 1:19:14.124
I can instead announce,
thanks to the Queen-in-waiting,

1:19:14.583 --> 1:19:17.335
that severe corruption is responsible

1:19:17.711 --> 1:19:19.171
for our recent hardships.

1:19:19.671 --> 1:19:21.590
It has been discovered and eliminated.

1:19:21.673 --> 1:19:26.261
The funds have been recovered,
and every one of you will be paid...

1:19:26.595 --> 1:19:28.430
She did it!Â She did it!

1:19:28.513 --> 1:19:30.766
-Merry Christmas, darling!
-...along with a Christmas bonus

1:19:30.849 --> 1:19:32.768
for every hard-working man
and woman in Aldovia.

1:19:33.143 --> 1:19:34.728
[cheering and applause]

1:19:39.065 --> 1:19:41.318

1:19:44.613 --> 1:19:45.655

1:19:46.531 --> 1:19:47.574

1:19:48.450 --> 1:19:49.743

1:19:50.202 --> 1:19:52.120
and the new Earl of Aldovia,

1:19:52.662 --> 1:19:54.206
Rudy Moore...

1:19:55.582 --> 1:19:57.542
I wish you all a very Merry Christmas.

1:19:58.251 --> 1:20:01.171
Let's celebrate with the lighting
of the royal Christmas tree.

1:20:07.803 --> 1:20:09.346

[guitar plays]

1:21:01.982 --> 1:21:04.860
-I believe I owe you a debt of gratitude.
-No, not at all.

1:21:05.360 --> 1:21:06.778
But, now that I've proven my mettle,

1:21:06.862 --> 1:21:08.947
and there being an open seat
on your Advisory Council--

1:21:09.030 --> 1:21:10.782
-Don't push your luck.
-Fair enough.

1:21:56.369 --> 1:21:57.579
My goodness.

Mom's right here with us, Peanut.

1:22:04.794 --> 1:22:05.879
I know, Pop.

1:22:15.096 --> 1:22:16.014
[laughs]

1:22:39.746 --> 1:22:41.289
Do you, King Richard,

1:22:41.373 --> 1:22:44.709
take the beautiful Amber Eve Moore
to be your bride?

1:22:45.210 --> 1:22:46.127
I do.

1:22:50.674 --> 1:22:54.844
Do you, Amber, takeÂ Richard Bevan Charlton
to be your husband?

1:22:55.887 --> 1:22:56.805
I do.
