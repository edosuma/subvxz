00:18.119 --> 00:20.321
When did you last
water my roses?

00:20.354 --> 00:23.324
Dad expects them to
be disciplined enough
to water themselves.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.793
No. It's not that
I expect them to
water themselves.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.598
It's that they'll have
the wherewithal to tough out
not being watered.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.968
You been packing
other people's clothes?

00:37.605 --> 00:39.407
I suspect it's full
of dirty laundry.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.609
Might be.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.777
Thought they taught you
discipline in boot camp,
Private Blane.

00:43.811 --> 00:47.215
They taught me to delegate.
Oh.
[ Chuckles ]

00:47.248 --> 00:49.850
- Roses.
- Yes, they are.

00:49.883 --> 00:55.223
Welcome home, my baby.
My baby.
[ Chuckles ]

00:55.256 --> 00:58.592
- You know what I think?
- I think my arms are gonna
pop off at the shoulders...

00:58.626 --> 01:00.728

and open the door.

All right, Betsy.

who kicked some serious ass--

01:50.278 --> 01:52.446
[ Man #1 ]
That's right.
[ Man #2 ] Sure did.

01:52.480 --> 01:56.450

from boot camp as
Private Elizabeth Blane.

01:56.484 --> 01:59.320
- Cheers, baby.
- [ Various People ]
Cheers.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.791
Well, I got
something else too.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.395
What's this?

02:10.298 --> 02:13.734
Hmm.
Imagine that.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.838
You know what I'm holding?

02:17.871 --> 02:19.973
Something that comes
as no surprise to me.

02:21.375 --> 02:25.379

Promoted to Private First Class,

No.
Hey, I'll get that.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.128
You take the poll.
You sure?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.996
About the ice or the poll?

02:45.333 --> 02:48.202
It's official.
[ Mock Gasps ]
You're pregnant!

02:48.236 --> 02:50.838
We're in the official
name-picking section
of our journey.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.410
[ Ice Clattering ]
I'll take some.

02:56.444 --> 02:59.247
Coming right up.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.652
- American soldier here!
- [ Gunshot ]

[ Sighs ]

03:08.188 --> 03:09.923
Bob?

03:11.225 --> 03:14.094
Bob, one question.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.431
Do you dream, Bob?

03:17.465 --> 03:20.768
[ Sighs ]
You're not here. Go away.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.203
If I'm not here,
I can't go away.

03:24.805 --> 03:28.075
So, I'm here.

03:28.108 --> 03:30.978
The fact is,
I'll always be here.

03:32.413 --> 03:36.016
[ Kim ]
Baby, people are
waiting for the ice.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.086
We bought too much.
Can you set that
in the fridge for me?

03:39.119 --> 03:42.956
Okay, so nobody likes
the name Oliver or Olivia
for the baby's name.

03:47.094 --> 03:48.228
Ice.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.798
Ice.

03:53.301 --> 03:56.270
[ Jonas ]
Town plaza.

03:56.304 --> 03:59.540
Surrounded on three sides
by multistory residential
and business buildings.

03:59.573 --> 04:03.811
- We can expect a lot of
civilian movement, I take it.
- You take it correctly.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.380
Up to and possibly
including the minute
of the event.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.549
You're sure the premier
will make an appearance?

04:08.582 --> 04:12.453
Bad intel makes
for dead soldiers.
This is the day.

04:12.486 --> 04:15.423
This is the one day of the year
that he must appear
before the people.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.625
And it must be here.

04:17.658 --> 04:21.962
Celebrates-- What is it?
Their liberation from the Turks
in 18-0-something?

04:21.995 --> 04:24.432
Yeah, well,
they call it Victory Day.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.267
But it makes no difference
who or why.

04:27.301 --> 04:30.571
The important thing is that
he will be there on Thursday
afternoon, 1700 hours.

04:30.604 --> 04:34.241
But he'll be in a crowd.
That's exactly right.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.010
And that's where Carlito's
special round comes in.

04:37.044 --> 04:40.180
It also makes
the angle of the shot critical.

04:40.213 --> 04:45.152
Now, normally, we'd be high,
engaged in plunging fire.

04:45.185 --> 04:48.589
[ Mack ]
High is where countersnipers
and surveillance will look.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.625
And that's why we will be
where they don't look.

04:51.659 --> 04:55.095
So we'll need to be positioned
around the plaza
on different sides.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.030
For maximum coverage,
we're gonna have to
be scattered.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.166
That violates
a sniper principle.
Yes.

04:59.199 --> 05:03.371
But if you are aware of the
principle and you violate it
knowingly, it's not a violation.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.506
It's called good tactics.

05:05.539 --> 05:08.308
So where do we set up?

05:08.342 --> 05:10.678
Mack, you're gonna be here
on the second level
of this building.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.546
Carlito, you'll be
in this building here.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.282
Hey, don't shoot me, bro.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.386
I'll try not to.
[ Jonas ]
Bob and I will be here.

05:18.419 --> 05:21.789
- I thought we were all
gonna be separated.
- You're the shooter, not me.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.692
I can best influence
and coordinate the action
from this point.

05:26.594 --> 05:29.797
Carlito, let's take those
Buck Rogers rounds
to the range...

05:29.830 --> 05:31.732
and see what they can do.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.267
[ Scoffs ]
I told you we're good to go,
Top. What? You don't trust me?

05:35.936 --> 05:39.907
The Big Communicator said,
"Trust, but verify."

05:46.614 --> 05:48.549
Gonna join us, Bob?

05:50.083 --> 05:52.052
Bob?

05:53.053 --> 05:55.055
Yeah, Top.
I'm coming.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.693
[ Man ]
Weapons down!
Check your target!

05:59.727 --> 06:02.663
Just like the other ones.
All less than half minute
of angle.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.433
What I tell you?
Even old Mack here
couldn't screw that up.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.901
And he tried.
[ Chuckles ]

06:07.935 --> 06:09.937
Well, that meets
the first test.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.373
Will the rounds stay in the body
without going through
and hitting someone else?

06:13.407 --> 06:15.676
[ Grey ]
Guaranteed.
And you're so sure why?

06:15.709 --> 06:18.879
Matter of physics.
I'll make it simple for you.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.882
I know they didn't cover that
in your G.E.D. course.
Thank you. I appreciate that.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.885
[ Grey Laughs ]
What I did here--

06:24.918 --> 06:28.889
I filled the central cavity
of the bullet half full
with mercury.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.358
So when the round is fired,
the mercury sets to the rear
of the bullet.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.627
Then on impact,
it slams to the front...

06:33.661 --> 06:36.229
where it meets the nose
of the bullet as it comes
crashing to the rear.

06:36.263 --> 06:39.633
[ Bob ] All that energy,
like, a ton and a half, gets
dumped in the target on impact.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.635
Yeah.
[ Jonas ]
Well, time to see.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.904
Mack can get the first shot.

06:43.937 --> 06:47.741
This is a normal issue round.
Should give you through
and through penetration.

if you please.

07:07.027 --> 07:11.064

Bullet went all the way
through the backstop.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.602
What did you expect
from ball ammo?

07:14.635 --> 07:18.271
[ Jonas ]
Well, let's see if Carlito's
special load performs.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.841
- Or is he just blowing smoke?
- [ Scoffs ]

07:35.055 --> 07:37.958

You're breathing on me.

Bullet stayed in.
No undue penetration.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.176
[ Chuckles ]
What'd I tell you?

08:29.209 --> 08:31.044
We can pluck a man out of
a crowd with that bullet.

08:31.078 --> 08:34.381
And have confidence it'll get
only its intended target.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.383
You did good,
Carlito.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.619
And blow its head off.
What was that?

08:40.721 --> 08:44.257
Do the same thing to a man,
it'll blow his head right off.
Remember this.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.194
The target
is only a stand-in
for a living man.

08:47.227 --> 08:50.130
It's not about the shooting.
It's about the killing.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.536
Yeah.

you'd like to see

You mean you, Bob?
When are you justified
in taking a life?

13:19.299 --> 13:21.768
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
When is it right?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.037
The Bible says,
"Thou shalt not kill."

13:24.071 --> 13:27.007
I used to be here,
on the teams, you know,
back in the '90s...

13:27.040 --> 13:28.976
before I got out
and went to the seminary.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.544
Yeah, I'd heard that rumor.
It's true.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.048
Well, look.
The Bible says,
"Thou shalt not kill."

13:35.082 --> 13:37.317
No, it says,
"Thou shalt not murder."

13:37.350 --> 13:39.819
Is that a small point?

13:39.853 --> 13:43.390
- I would--
- It says,
"Thou shalt not murder."

13:43.423 --> 13:45.325
Okay?
The two words in Hebrew
are quite distinct.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.560
And so the use
is quite intentional.

13:47.594 --> 13:51.798
Murder is the unnecessary
and immoral taking of life.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.501
Well, is the taking of life
ever necessary?
You know that it is.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.137
Would you ever kill an intruder
who came into your home...

13:57.170 --> 13:58.872
in the middle of the night
to harm your family?

13:58.906 --> 14:01.174
Would you?

14:04.177 --> 14:07.580
Some say that
the taking of life
is never justified.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.350
Those people, soldier,
employ others to protect them...

14:10.383 --> 14:12.252
so that they will never
have to face that choice.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.687
Do you hear me?

14:14.721 --> 14:17.224
[ Sighs ]
Yeah, I hear you.

14:17.257 --> 14:20.727
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.763
But?
[ Chuckling ]

14:23.796 --> 14:26.866
"But."
That's right.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.602
Okay, let me tell you
this one thing.
Oh, I know.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.906
God loves me.
Yes, God loves you.

14:32.940 --> 14:36.009
Hey, and I know you're hurting.
But I'd like you
to leave with this.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.311
When there is
no more information,
it's time to make a decision.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.249
Mm-hmm.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.120
We all have our limits.
Maybe you've had enough.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.623
God bless you.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.597
Oklahoma Board of Education.

14:57.630 --> 15:01.434
Creek County school district,
Oklahoma Hall of Records,
City Hall--

15:01.468 --> 15:04.104
[ Tiffy ] And?
[ Kim ]
Nothing.

15:04.137 --> 15:08.075
No class roster for Depew High,
graduating class of 1980.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.210
Maybe we got the wrong year.
No.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.412
Checked five years back,
a couple of years forward.

15:12.445 --> 15:17.717
No class rosters. No archives
of graduation photos.
School closed in 1982.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.654
The lady at the Chamber of
Commerce told me all the records
got lost in transit somehow.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.490
Well, then that's that.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.793
There's gotta be someone
in Depew knows how I can get
a picture of that class.

15:26.826 --> 15:30.397
I want to give it to Molly and
Betsy before Betsy leaves.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.899
[ Annie ]
Betsy's orders'll
come in on Monday.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.801
That just gives us two days.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.670
- Well, there's just
not enough time.
- I got an idea.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.672
I have a feeling
I'm not gonna like this.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.642
The man at the Board of
Education said Depew's
such a small town,

15:42.675 --> 15:44.744
one man did all
the graduation photos
for the schools.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.147
Call him up.
Can't.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.517
Ephraim Watson's in his 80s,
lives with his daughter, Ruth.
They're poor.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.486
No e-mail, no--
No way.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.489
- Think of it
as a fun road trip.
- Oh, you were in on this too?

15:56.523 --> 15:59.026
Think of it as a no.
Lookit.

15:59.059 --> 16:02.195
It had to be so hard on Molly.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.331
Her dad dies
the day of her graduation.

16:04.364 --> 16:08.501
Now her daughter's
gonna finish O.C.S.,
deploy to God knows where.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.806
Having a piece of your history
can be a real comfort.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.476
I want this picture.
[ Sighs ]
Kim, I can't do this.

16:16.509 --> 16:20.513
- I've got the kids.
- I arranged for Haley to sit
the night you'll be gone.

16:20.547 --> 16:23.183
I cannot afford to lose my tips.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.985
I got you the night off
and two shifts
to make up for it.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.321
Well, thank you very much.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.357
My car is--
[ Annie ]
We're taking mine.

16:30.390 --> 16:35.162
- Oh, we're taking--
- Which one do I get to be?
Thelma or Louise?

16:37.597 --> 16:40.100
Yeah!
[ Laughs ]

16:41.701 --> 16:44.637
[ Annie ]
Depew, here we come!

16:44.671 --> 16:49.209
Lady back at the restaurant
said Depew's six miles ahead
as the crow flies.

16:49.242 --> 16:53.713
You see a crow? 'Cause all I see
is Kim Brown's neck between
my hands and me squeezing.

16:53.746 --> 16:58.851
[ Laughs ]
Oh, pretty country.
If you're a possum.

16:58.885 --> 17:01.588
What did they say the
photographer's name was again?
Ephraim Watson.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.923
It can't be hard to find.
No?

17:03.956 --> 17:06.693
We have no phone number,
no address. Just that he lives
at the south end of town.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.162
The town's
the size of my hand.
Great.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.098
You give me his height
and weight,

17:11.131 --> 17:14.401
I'll buy a tape measure,
and we'll stop every
little old man around Depew.

17:14.434 --> 17:19.005
Oh, my God.
You are just determined to have
a bad time, aren't you?

17:19.038 --> 17:21.674
- Absolutely.
- [ Laughs ]

17:21.708 --> 17:24.144
[ Chuckles ]

17:30.150 --> 17:32.585
[ Tapping ]

17:32.619 --> 17:34.754
He doesn't talk?

17:34.787 --> 17:37.257
[ Woman ]
Not since '99.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.526
But he kept the photos
of when he worked, right?

17:39.559 --> 17:42.195
Now why would he do that?

17:42.229 --> 17:45.865
Uh, files,
someone wanting reprints?

17:45.898 --> 17:48.101
He might've.

17:48.135 --> 17:52.105
Did your father do all
the school graduations in Depew?

17:52.139 --> 17:54.141
You can talk to him.
He can hear.

17:54.174 --> 17:59.078
- He just won't answer.
But do him the courtesy.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

17:59.112 --> 18:04.117
Mr. Watson, did you take
the pictures of the 1980
high school graduation at Depew?

18:04.151 --> 18:08.087
No.
No, he did not.

18:08.121 --> 18:12.125
Mr. Watson, do you know
where any of the photos
of the graduation might be?

18:12.159 --> 18:16.596
Anyone who graduated that year
might still have them?
Might still live around here?

18:16.629 --> 18:19.299
Weren't any
graduation photos
that year.

18:21.868 --> 18:27.174
Why? And if that's so,
how come you
remember so clearly?

18:27.207 --> 18:31.911
My daddy would make 55 dollars
he took pictures
of a graduating class.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.682
My mother,
her budget for food
each month was 50 dollars.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.985
He'd come from a job
and we'd all joke,
"Daddy brought dinner."

18:40.553 --> 18:43.122
Summer of '80, daddy
didn't bring home dinner.

18:43.156 --> 18:46.259
[ Annie ]
But he was hired to.
He was.

18:46.293 --> 18:50.297
But the principal gets
shot dead right near
the end of the ceremony,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.299
nobody wants pictures
of the class.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.177
Report.

19:06.012 --> 19:09.782
- All quiet
on the western front.
- [ Jonas ] Roger that.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.219
[ Grey ]
Only thing deadly around here
is the boredom.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.554
[ Jonas ]
Then motivate yourself.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.630
What the hell
are you doing?

19:23.663 --> 19:26.799
[ Sighs ]
Maybe no one saw.

19:26.833 --> 19:30.737
[ Mack ] Hey, I saw movement.
If I saw it, somebody else did.
You're burned. You gotta move.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.706
Roger that. Going to
the alternate position.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.142
I don't know what
I was thinking, Jonas.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.678
What the hell kind of
rookie-ass stunt was that?

19:38.711 --> 19:41.214
Blow a mission that's been
months in the making.

19:41.248 --> 19:43.950
I don't know where
your head's at, but you better
get it screwed on, quick.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.019
Clear out!

20:00.433 --> 20:02.635
Is this the sexy new you?
Mm-hmm.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.406
[ Snaps ]
Whoo!
[ Chuckles ]

20:07.474 --> 20:09.876
[ Phone Rings ]

20:11.077 --> 20:12.879
Kim?
Yeah.

20:12.912 --> 20:16.916
Hey, we were waiting
for you to call back.
We have some info.

20:16.949 --> 20:20.887
Well, the photographer,
Ephraim Watson, he can't talk.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.624
His daughter tells us that the
principal got shot and killed
the day of the graduation.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.893
I have bigger news than that.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.396
The Creek County Board of
Education got back to me.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.899
Tyrone Rutgers was never
principal of Depew High
and--

20:32.932 --> 20:34.667
No records of Tyrone as
a principal of the school.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.372
Hey, I don't get it.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.774
I already know the principal
of the school was shot.

20:41.808 --> 20:44.277
But his name wasn't
Tyrone Rutgers.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.979
His name was Harrold Simmons.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.782
But didn't Betsy tell us
that her grandfather's
first name was Tyrone?

20:49.816 --> 20:53.052
And wasn't Molly's
maiden name Rutgers?
I don't understand.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.022
I'm working on it.
News on the fives.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.996
Some things you just
don't want to talk about.
So you change them for a reason.

21:06.198 --> 21:10.069
So you lie
to your closest friends?
You don't lie outright.

21:10.102 --> 21:14.441
But... you just leave out
some of the information.

21:14.474 --> 21:17.344
Why?
Because it's too painful.

21:18.978 --> 21:23.182
You want to know
what's more painful?
What's that?

21:23.215 --> 21:26.152
Having your lies found out.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.657
[ Chattering
In Foreign Language ]

21:39.366 --> 21:41.267
In alternate position.
Going active again.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.269
Roger.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.872
Same. Same.

21:45.905 --> 21:49.676
Now everybody, say,
"Thank you, Bob."

21:49.709 --> 21:52.445
[ Mack and Grey ]
Thank you, Bob.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.747
Take the scope.
I'll take the rifle.

21:56.683 --> 22:01.521
The angle changed.
This may be
one hell of a shot.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.359
You want to tell me where
you left that head of yours?

22:06.393 --> 22:07.894
Because it sure as hell
ain't on this mission.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.397
No excuses, Top.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.733
"No excuses,"
the new "screw you."
That just don't cut it, slim.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.335
Now I need an answer.
And I need the real one.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.473
Jonas, uh,
I don't know. I was just--

22:20.507 --> 22:22.208
Spit it out
so you don't choke on it.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.679
Right.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.915
The real one?

22:30.583 --> 22:32.385
We were sent here
to kill a man.

22:35.121 --> 22:38.658
Go on.

22:38.691 --> 22:42.028
We have premeditated his death
and will carry it out
no matter what.

22:42.061 --> 22:44.163
Exactly so.

22:44.196 --> 22:48.668
Well, then tell me how that
differs from murder. Because
our government sent us to do it?

22:48.701 --> 22:52.539
I mean, if I did this on my own,
if I killed this man
for profit or revenge,

22:52.572 --> 22:54.574
I would be hunted down
as a murderer.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.846
Put your eye
back on the scope.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.214
[ Sighs ]

23:03.950 --> 23:06.453
How long you been thinking
about this?

23:06.486 --> 23:08.521
I don't know.
A while.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.557
And you just thought
to tell me this today?

23:10.590 --> 23:13.693
Well, I thought--
Well, what you thought
doesn't work.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.728
And you brought it on the job.

23:17.497 --> 23:20.900
[ Sighs ]
Well, you're gonna
have to work it out...

23:20.933 --> 23:24.036
- like everybody else.
- Everybody else?

23:24.070 --> 23:27.440
You think you're unique?
Happens to everyone.

23:29.308 --> 23:31.911
What surprises me
is it took you so long.

23:36.949 --> 23:40.987
"Patty Ann Gustafson
had her son, Chimney"--
Chimney--

23:41.020 --> 23:45.057
"and the kids over
for cheese dip and crackers
last Sunday."

23:45.091 --> 23:47.927
We're a weekly paper.
No idea what
she's serving tomorrow.

23:49.095 --> 23:52.499
Okay, I got something.
June 11, 1980.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.634
Graduation,
Depew High School.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.736
Yeah, the principal
was shot and killed.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.839
Harrold Simmons, 59.
Harrold Simmons?

23:59.872 --> 24:04.010
Mmm. Shot by
an Avery Flowers, 42.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.913
- No apparent motive.
- At the trial?

24:06.946 --> 24:11.417
Mmm, he was convicted,
sentenced to 32 years,
Creek Prison.

24:11.450 --> 24:15.421
Huh.
Is he still alive?
He still in prison?

24:15.454 --> 24:19.759
As far as I can see.
He's been in prison
almost 30 years.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.995
Thank you.
Welcome.

24:24.864 --> 24:27.299
I'm gonna find out
why he shot Molly's father.

24:27.333 --> 24:30.302
She deserves to know.
How can this be
a good thing, Tiff?

24:30.336 --> 24:34.440
- Why kick up the dust?
- Because I need to know.
Molly needs to know.

24:34.473 --> 24:38.811
If Molly needed to know,
she knew where
to find this guy, right?

24:38.845 --> 24:41.948
She knew he was in prison.
Look. You didn't want to take
this trip in the first place.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.016
And the reason for taking it
is finished.

24:44.050 --> 24:46.519
Not for me.
All right, you go there.

24:46.553 --> 24:52.158
You talk to this killer.
You bring into your life
somebody you don't want there.

24:52.191 --> 24:55.728
[ Scoffs ]
Just don't do this.
Please.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.730
Just come home.
No.

24:57.764 --> 25:01.367
I want to look at this man.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.974
The other guys too?

25:08.007 --> 25:11.043
Yeah, well,
once the novelty wears off--

25:11.077 --> 25:13.012
That's what makes
these missions
the hardest of all.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.249
And so?
So--

25:17.283 --> 25:21.520
[ Sighs ]
You're gonna have to sort
your way through it.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.424
- Or quit.
- Quit?

25:25.457 --> 25:27.594
What? You think
you were the first?

25:27.627 --> 25:30.096
Certainly won't be the last.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.864
I've considered it myself.

25:34.266 --> 25:39.405
The question I have now
is can I depend on you
for th mission?

25:39.438 --> 25:41.173
And I need an honest answer.

25:41.207 --> 25:44.343
Yes.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.946
Jonas, yes.
You can depend on me
for this mission.

25:46.979 --> 25:51.117
All right.
Because we've got
another problem.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.452
What's that?

25:53.485 --> 25:55.622
We've changed rooms.
We've changed angles.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.090
And I need measurements.

25:58.124 --> 26:02.061
And my range finder
just martyred itself.

get out of the briar patch.

and pace off a range for me.

26:15.642 --> 26:17.744

you gotta give
me some love.
