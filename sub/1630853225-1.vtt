WEBVTT

00:12.187 --> 00:15.287
<i>It began centuries ago.</i>

00:15.685 --> 00:18.323
<i>He started as an entity,</i>

00:18.688 --> 00:22.294
<i>gaining more power</i>
<i>with every infected soul.</i>

00:23.165 --> 00:27.398
<i>The world thought it was the</i>
<i>next plague, but it was more.</i>

00:28.731 --> 00:33.701
<i>He is the god Chaos,</i>
<i>self-proclaimed, of course,</i>

00:34.374 --> 00:36.671
<i>escaping the realm of chaos,</i>

00:37.212 --> 00:39.839
<i>a void between Heaven and Earth.</i>

00:41.480 --> 00:44.745
<i>He defied</i>
<i>the gods of ancient Greece,</i>

00:45.352 --> 00:49.585
<i>spreading diseases and</i>
<i>blasphemous ideas of revolution.</i>

00:50.918 --> 00:54.227
<i>Olympus fell many centuries ago,</i>

00:54.625 --> 00:59.496
<i>as Zeus and his fellow gods</i>
<i>faded like burnt stars.</i>

01:01.599 --> 01:05.634
<i>With no gods to wreak</i>
<i>his vengeance upon,</i>

01:06.472 --> 01:12.278
<i>Chaos sought those crafted</i>
<i>in Zeus's image, the humans.</i>

01:13.776 --> 01:16.744
<i>With his herd, Erebus and Nyx,</i>

01:16.779 --> 01:19.549
<i>-he infects and destroys.</i>

01:19.947 --> 01:23.421
<i>And those lost souls</i>
<i>become joiners.</i>

01:23.951 --> 01:26.820
<i>Their roaming</i>
<i>has spread the plague further.</i>

01:29.264 --> 01:34.498
<i>Slowly, the world is being</i>
<i>consumed of all human soul.</i>

01:36.403 --> 01:40.603
<i>Most of the survivors</i>
<i>escape the cities and live.</i>

01:40.638 --> 01:42.803
<i>Many fall when they return</i>

01:42.838 --> 01:45.245
<i>-to cities to scavenge.</i>

01:48.943 --> 01:54.518
<i>The only hope lies in the</i>
<i>bloodlines of the goddess Nike.</i>

02:08.864 --> 02:12.503
<i>Only they can bring</i>
<i>an end to Chaos.</i>

02:17.510 --> 02:19.939
<i>For centuries,</i>
<i>the Phalanx Knights</i>

02:20.348 --> 02:21.677
<i>were guardians.</i>

02:22.946 --> 02:26.715
<i>I've read the scriptures</i>
<i>and heeded the warnings</i>

02:27.322 --> 02:30.554
<i>that for millennia</i>
<i>the seers have predicted.</i>

02:38.663 --> 02:41.499
<i>We have sought out</i>
<i>the Nike lineage,</i>

02:41.963 --> 02:44.634
<i>prepared them and trained them,</i>

02:44.933 --> 02:48.341
<i>waiting for the time</i>
<i>Chaos would return.</i>

02:49.509 --> 02:51.674
<i>The time is now.</i>

03:06.790 --> 03:11.892
<i>But slowly, he is seeking out</i>
<i>and eradicating the bloodline.</i>

03:13.599 --> 03:16.501
<i>Only a few remain.</i>

03:22.641 --> 03:26.610
<i>These three women</i>
<i>of the Nike bloodline</i>

03:27.349 --> 03:30.911
<i>have been under my tutelage</i>
<i>for a while now.</i>

03:32.783 --> 03:35.421
<i>It's not often</i>
<i>I come across a family,</i>

03:36.050 --> 03:40.525
<i>but these three sisters</i>
<i>have trained for this moment.</i>

03:42.056 --> 03:46.795
<i>Chaos does not wait until his</i>
<i>enemies are ready for him, no.</i>

03:47.633 --> 03:52.306
<i>And the end of days</i>
<i>waits for no man.</i>

04:21.865 --> 04:23.733
You are too important to lose!

04:24.538 --> 04:25.867
We go, now!

04:27.442 --> 04:28.903
Your sisters are lost.

04:29.906 --> 04:32.346
No!

05:37.545 --> 05:38.841
Don't!

05:38.876 --> 05:41.140
-Give it to me! Give it to me!
-No!

05:46.114 --> 05:47.586
Stop!

06:02.229 --> 06:03.470
No!

06:04.231 --> 06:05.538
Wait!

07:22.012 --> 07:25.717
Lock her down.
I want to see her face.

07:31.791 --> 07:33.923
No!

07:33.958 --> 07:36.662
Your last breaths
will bear witness

07:36.697 --> 07:40.963
to your blood escaping,
and I am one step closer

07:40.998 --> 07:43.570
to ending your wretched
bloodline for good.

07:50.579 --> 07:54.878
My minions will drink it,
feast on it,

07:55.342 --> 07:57.276
and I will bathe in it,

07:57.311 --> 08:00.279
increasing my power
with every drop.

08:06.859 --> 08:08.562
No!

08:11.292 --> 08:13.831
This is your legacy.

08:16.605 --> 08:18.297
Pathetic.

08:20.070 --> 08:21.872
No!

08:29.310 --> 08:31.079
No!

09:32.406 --> 09:33.911
Nicole?

09:35.013 --> 09:36.276
Dad?

09:51.898 --> 09:54.866
-Are you okay?
-Dad said my name!

09:58.135 --> 10:00.773
That's, that's good.

10:06.814 --> 10:08.407
I don't want you
to get your hopes up.

10:09.751 --> 10:12.378
He still isn't aware
of his surroundings.

10:13.381 --> 10:16.888
Just please,
don't expect too much.

10:16.923 --> 10:19.385
I know, Mom. It's okay.

10:19.893 --> 10:21.893
It's just nice to hear,
that's all.

10:21.928 --> 10:26.128
Besides, if we
can't get food soon,

10:27.032 --> 10:29.329
none of us
will survive for long.

10:29.364 --> 10:31.331
The nearby wood has
been picked clean

10:31.366 --> 10:32.904
of everything that
wasn't rotted.

10:32.939 --> 10:35.808
Sorry. Failed.

10:36.272 --> 10:38.338
No, you did your best.

10:40.408 --> 10:42.375
What else can we do?

10:44.049 --> 10:48.150
Those things out there are
growing in number by the day.

10:48.185 --> 10:50.383
I need to go back
into the city tomorrow.

10:50.418 --> 10:54.959
Oh, no, please, no. Please.

10:56.160 --> 11:00.360
We're gonna find a way.
We can check the lakes again.

11:00.395 --> 11:03.000
We can't afford
more wasted days, Mom.

11:03.035 --> 11:05.035
We need some food
and we need some medicine.

11:05.070 --> 11:06.399
It's too dangerous!

11:06.434 --> 11:08.203
I need to go further this time,

11:08.238 --> 11:11.844
old industrial sites,
maybe raid a warehouse or two.

11:12.176 --> 11:13.472
If they've not
been picked clean.

11:15.014 --> 11:20.754
I can argue,
but you won't listen, will you?

11:20.789 --> 11:24.252
Sorry. I need to do it.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.057
Mom!

11:30.326 --> 11:31.732
Leave me alone.

12:50.340 --> 12:52.010
What is it?

12:52.045 --> 12:53.946
Don't touch me!

12:53.981 --> 12:55.442
What on earth happened?

13:15.530 --> 13:17.002
Wait.

13:17.037 --> 13:18.630
What?

13:18.665 --> 13:21.875
-I've got some food here.
-Really? What have you got?

13:22.405 --> 13:26.011
Plenty.
Maybe I'm feeling generous.

13:26.574 --> 13:28.343
You'll give me food out
of the kindness of your heart?

13:28.378 --> 13:30.477
Maybe you'll do
something for me, too.

13:30.512 --> 13:33.612
Really?
What have you got in mind?

13:33.647 --> 13:36.989
Babe, we can see
the world's going to shit.

13:38.685 --> 13:41.620
Might just take the two of us
to continue the human species.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.260
You know, you're kind of ugly.

13:44.295 --> 13:46.427
I think I can make a better
looking baby with someone else.

13:46.462 --> 13:48.495
I'm all for saving humanity,

13:48.530 --> 13:50.431
but you look
like joiner shit already.

13:53.007 --> 13:55.271
Now, I was nice to you.

13:56.274 --> 13:57.405
Sure.

14:15.964 --> 14:21.000
Get the fuck out of here,
little boy.

14:32.981 --> 14:35.377
Jackpot!

14:37.447 --> 14:40.316
-Impressive.
-Who the hell are you?

14:41.319 --> 14:43.649
Come with me and I'll tell you.

14:43.684 --> 14:45.519
You know they teach
little kids not to run off

14:45.554 --> 14:47.587
with strangers when they're
three years old, right?

14:47.622 --> 14:50.590
Want to sit around here,
counting your beans?

14:50.625 --> 14:53.065
Or you want
to come save the world?

14:53.100 --> 14:56.134
I'm interested,
and don't get too close,

14:56.169 --> 14:58.037
or I'll punch you in the face.

14:58.072 --> 15:01.040
Well then, let's begin.

16:55.618 --> 16:59.488
Your attack is crude and slow,
like that of a clumsy...

16:59.523 --> 17:01.193
What do you want?

17:01.228 --> 17:05.560
I want you, child
of Valeria, descendant of Nike.

17:05.595 --> 17:09.102
Jesus, another med junkie.
Leave me alone!

17:10.204 --> 17:11.665
Wait!

17:12.899 --> 17:14.734
Leave me alone, junkie.

17:14.769 --> 17:17.341
Go get your next fix
and quit bugging me.

17:18.278 --> 17:21.840
I am no junkie. I am a Guardian.

17:22.315 --> 17:23.677
You've got a screw loose.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.647
In case you didn't notice,

17:26.682 --> 17:29.815
the whole world has
got a screw loose.

17:29.850 --> 17:32.818
They've succumbed
to a virus, a plague.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.887
I suppose you'll say
this is Biblical?

17:35.922 --> 17:40.100
Not at all.
This is completely ungodly.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.700
Wait! Hear me out.

17:48.902 --> 17:53.410
-You've got two minutes.
-I only need one.

17:56.217 --> 17:57.810
Where are we going?

17:58.813 --> 18:01.352
Keep up.
We need to find shelter.

18:02.388 --> 18:04.388
Darkness is falling.

19:06.617 --> 19:08.881
You like coffee?

19:12.260 --> 19:16.559
Chaos, the self-proclaimed god,

19:16.594 --> 19:21.564
is slowly gaining more
power as he turns more souls

19:21.764 --> 19:26.866
and ingests the essence of more
of goddess Nike's bloodline.

19:27.803 --> 19:31.244
You are one
of only a few who remain.

19:31.279 --> 19:33.444
I'm no descendant of a goddess.

19:33.479 --> 19:35.611
My mother was
an office administrator

19:35.646 --> 19:37.217
before the great plague.

19:37.417 --> 19:39.450
Your family adopted you.

19:39.485 --> 19:42.288
They knew nothing
of your true background.

19:42.323 --> 19:43.586
That's not true.

19:44.789 --> 19:49.295
Search inside yourself, Nicole.
You know this to be true.

19:51.497 --> 19:53.332
You always felt different.

19:54.335 --> 19:56.929
You have a strength
you can't control,

19:57.965 --> 20:02.341
visions you can't comprehend.

20:02.376 --> 20:05.476
I've been searching
for you for 20 years.

20:06.710 --> 20:10.008
I knew your mother,
your birth mother.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.746
What happened to her?

20:12.386 --> 20:16.652
The descendants of Nike
all have their gifts,

20:17.424 --> 20:20.986
but one line
of the blood from the seed

20:21.021 --> 20:24.561
of Zeus himself
holds most power.

20:25.597 --> 20:29.434
Within you is the power
of god and goddess,

20:29.469 --> 20:31.502
enough to save the world.

20:31.537 --> 20:35.506
If Chaos kills you
and bathes in your blood,

20:35.970 --> 20:38.542
it will bring about
eternal darkness.

20:39.479 --> 20:41.776
The world will succumb
to the plague.

20:42.944 --> 20:44.944
The planet will slowly die.

20:44.979 --> 20:48.915
Okay, so don't let him kill me.
I got you.

20:51.051 --> 20:52.622
But what happened to my mother?

20:53.053 --> 20:55.856
Your mother knew of her gifts,

20:56.595 --> 21:01.895
knew what she needed to do,
but she was still a mother.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.901
It came down
to her life or yours.

21:07.936 --> 21:12.477
As Chaos destroyed her,
I escaped with you,

21:13.040 --> 21:15.348
took you to an orphanage.

21:15.812 --> 21:19.583
I have been tracking
your moves ever since,

21:20.421 --> 21:23.488
and finally, we meet.

21:23.523 --> 21:24.885
Why didn't you help her?

21:24.920 --> 21:28.427
I have an obligation
to my own bloodline.

21:28.924 --> 21:31.628
For centuries, we have
sought the bloodline,

21:32.697 --> 21:35.632
to train them to face Chaos.

21:37.031 --> 21:38.767
We have come
to the final impasse.

21:39.836 --> 21:42.408
The line is almost ended.

21:42.443 --> 21:43.904
So what do we do now?

21:46.480 --> 21:50.009
We save humanity
or witness its end.

21:50.847 --> 21:53.881
-I'm not ready.
-It's okay.

21:54.983 --> 21:56.785
I'm here to train you.

21:56.820 --> 22:00.118
But first, you must
meet your cousins.

22:05.796 --> 22:07.158
This is strange.

22:08.931 --> 22:11.701
Joiners tend to stay
within the confines of the city.

22:11.736 --> 22:14.099
Probably widening
their search for food.

22:15.443 --> 22:16.706
There aren't
too many people left

22:16.741 --> 22:18.543
to infect and feast on
in the city.

22:23.011 --> 22:24.780
It looks hungry.

22:26.454 --> 22:30.148
I'll see if it wants
some iron in its diet.

22:53.613 --> 22:56.042
Always be aware
of your surroundings.

22:57.485 --> 22:59.947
Ensure a head or a heart shot.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.049
These things
are getting tougher.

23:04.756 --> 23:07.427
We have much
to do to get you ready.

23:16.966 --> 23:19.164
Nicole!

23:24.171 --> 23:26.446
You have a boyfriend?

23:27.515 --> 23:29.207
No, he's not my boyfriend.

23:29.242 --> 23:34.047
Good.
You can do better, no offense.

23:34.687 --> 23:37.523
This is Roderick
Sanchez Villalobos.

23:37.558 --> 23:39.085
Call me Rhodri.

23:43.124 --> 23:46.092
I'm Bijork, Nicole's mother.

23:48.195 --> 23:49.502
Mama?

23:51.605 --> 23:52.967
Sit down.

23:53.266 --> 23:54.936
We need to talk.

24:11.823 --> 24:12.987
Father.

24:16.091 --> 24:19.499
Amazing how quickly
the blood goes.

24:19.831 --> 24:24.196
It's been mere days since
we killed the evil witches.

24:25.133 --> 24:29.135
But now,
one bowl of crimson remains.

24:30.105 --> 24:34.679
I want more! Every last
drop of that cursed bloodline!

24:35.044 --> 24:37.110
You may get your wish, Father.

24:37.585 --> 24:41.521
We have tracked Villalobos
and his new recruits.

24:41.919 --> 24:43.985
That makes two
that we know of then.

24:44.020 --> 24:46.856
Including the bitch
that escaped us.

24:46.891 --> 24:48.561
Yes.

24:49.190 --> 24:51.157
Keep our spies upon them.

24:51.192 --> 24:53.698
I want to know
where they are housed

24:53.733 --> 24:55.733
and how many
of the witches he has with him.

24:55.768 --> 24:58.604
Then we will end it.

24:59.266 --> 25:00.969
It will be done, Father.

25:02.071 --> 25:04.973
In the meantime, scour London.

25:05.008 --> 25:08.944
Scrape it clean.
I want more minions.

25:12.785 --> 25:14.279
What is going on?

25:14.314 --> 25:17.590
Tail them.
We are going on a hunt.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.863
-For the Nike women?
-Not yet.

25:27.228 --> 25:29.965
For rogue troglodytes.

25:31.364 --> 25:35.333
-No fun.
-Consider it your training.

25:40.076 --> 25:42.780
The world is within my grasp.

25:45.279 --> 25:47.851
Why did you never tell me?

25:50.350 --> 25:52.658
We were going to tell you.

25:54.354 --> 25:58.664
We thought maybe we'd help
you find your birth parents.

26:03.396 --> 26:08.300
But the plague happened.
Everything fell apart.

26:10.876 --> 26:14.009
We didn't see
the point in upsetting you,

26:15.980 --> 26:17.375
and to be honest,

26:17.410 --> 26:21.148
I never expected us
to survive this long.

26:25.319 --> 26:28.925
You know
I love you unconditionally,

26:29.862 --> 26:32.093
as if you were mine.

26:32.128 --> 26:34.194
I always have.

26:35.395 --> 26:37.362
Henry, too.

26:38.838 --> 26:40.706
I know.

26:42.369 --> 26:47.042
You're both my parents, even if
our blood says differently.

26:50.443 --> 26:55.688
I always knew you were special.
Now I know why.

26:56.251 --> 26:58.988
I don't feel special.

27:00.827 --> 27:03.058
I told you you were special.

27:04.061 --> 27:06.226
You are the one,

27:06.261 --> 27:08.426
but we have little time.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.231
We need to begin training.

27:12.806 --> 27:16.401
It won't be long
before we must face Chaos.

27:17.745 --> 27:23.342
Either we find him or he
finds us, but battle is near.

28:48.462 --> 28:51.034
-Submit.
-Bite me!

28:51.069 --> 28:52.431
I'll break it.

28:57.141 --> 29:01.341
Let her go. Alina,
let go of her arm.

29:01.376 --> 29:02.474
No!

29:03.609 --> 29:06.148
Lindsay, just submit.

29:06.612 --> 29:08.788
We don't have time
to fool around.

29:11.188 --> 29:12.550
You can't win this one.

29:13.553 --> 29:15.388
Just submit and I'll let you go.

29:22.067 --> 29:25.035
I submit. I submit!

29:29.976 --> 29:31.305
Very mature.

29:32.572 --> 29:34.407
What is this?

29:35.047 --> 29:36.882
She thought she was
something special,

29:36.917 --> 29:38.950
and I thought I'd
teach her she isn't.

29:39.381 --> 29:41.414
All I've learned is
that you're a dickhead.

29:41.449 --> 29:43.581
-Enough, Lindsay.

29:44.419 --> 29:45.957
Go to your room.

29:46.223 --> 29:47.926
Now!

29:47.961 --> 29:49.928
My sisters were
far better than her,

29:49.963 --> 29:51.259
and they both fell to Chaos.

29:51.294 --> 29:52.931
You need
to bring me better, Rhodri,

29:52.966 --> 29:55.032
if you want to save the world.

29:57.465 --> 30:00.169
Another little princess, I see.

30:01.271 --> 30:02.875
This is Nicole.

30:04.109 --> 30:07.011
Whatever.
She won't last the week.

30:07.981 --> 30:09.541
You don't look so tough.

30:12.348 --> 30:14.953
Oh, sweetie, don't even try me.

30:14.988 --> 30:17.549
I'm really not in the mood.
I was kind to Lindsay.

30:17.584 --> 30:19.353
I won't give you the
chance to submit.

30:19.388 --> 30:21.520
I'll just snap
your arm like a wishbone.

30:21.555 --> 30:23.225
We'll see.

30:23.260 --> 30:24.358
Enough, ladies!

30:25.559 --> 30:27.262
There is work here to be done.

30:27.968 --> 30:32.333
In case you have forgotten,
we have an apocalypse to stop.

30:33.402 --> 30:35.435
You're cute when you get angry.

30:38.143 --> 30:40.209
Women.

30:42.477 --> 30:45.181
Come on, Nancy.
I'll show you the way.

30:45.216 --> 30:48.349
-It's Nicole!
Whatever.

30:54.456 --> 30:58.227
I know this is tough and so soon

30:58.262 --> 31:00.658
after Crystal and Dominique
were lost to you.

31:02.035 --> 31:04.233
But I can't give you
time to grieve.

31:05.566 --> 31:07.401
We don't have that luxury.

31:09.273 --> 31:14.342
You just need to accept
these new girls and move on,

31:15.477 --> 31:17.279
if not for yourself,

31:18.447 --> 31:22.680
but for humanity
and your sisters.

31:24.288 --> 31:27.553
Don't let their deaths
be in vain.

31:27.588 --> 31:30.028
I can't get close, Rhodri.

31:31.031 --> 31:33.361
I'm not ready
to lose anyone else.

31:34.265 --> 31:36.694
I'm not asking you
to be best buddies.

31:39.237 --> 31:44.471
I'm asking you to work together.
It is the only way.

31:46.673 --> 31:49.982
Fine. I'm a professional.

31:50.281 --> 31:53.447
You better be right
about these girls.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.681
Time will tell.

32:17.143 --> 32:19.572
I apologize to you
both for my behavior.

32:27.219 --> 32:28.284
Forget it.

32:36.756 --> 32:38.195
Good.

32:38.626 --> 32:41.231
Now that we have
settled our differences,

32:41.266 --> 32:42.694
we can get to work.

32:43.697 --> 32:46.434
But first,
I have something for you.

32:53.311 --> 32:55.740
No way.

33:12.396 --> 33:17.168
Ladies, the fight for your life
begins here and now.

33:17.698 --> 33:20.699
Training, let's go.

33:25.805 --> 33:27.343
Harder!

33:30.315 --> 33:32.843
Keep centered.

34:08.485 --> 34:10.617
You're off balance
when you strike with your right.

34:13.391 --> 34:16.128
♪♪

34:20.464 --> 34:22.299
Try and stay
a little more centered.

34:23.203 --> 34:24.895
Thanks, Alina.

34:24.930 --> 34:27.502
♪♪

34:29.935 --> 34:34.872
♪♪

36:50.614 --> 36:52.515
Are you sure they're ready?

36:52.880 --> 36:55.518
It's now or never, Alina.

36:57.753 --> 37:02.426
Are you ready? I need to see
you working together in unison.

37:03.055 --> 37:04.692
It's the only way.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.935
Fuck!

37:20.347 --> 37:22.479
We've got no weapons!

37:30.082 --> 37:32.951
Oy! Fuckhead!

39:44.117 --> 39:46.854
-What is it?
-It's an old radio.

39:48.561 --> 39:50.154
<i>Report!</i>

39:51.025 --> 39:52.893
<i>What is their current location?</i>

39:53.698 --> 39:55.192
<i>Report!</i>

39:55.227 --> 39:57.667
<i>Your master Chaos</i>
<i>demands confirmation.</i>

39:57.966 --> 40:01.671
<i>How many bloodline remain?</i>
<i>Confirm location.</i>

40:03.070 --> 40:06.005
<i>Confirm last known location.</i>

40:06.040 --> 40:08.480
<i>10 clicks northwest of the city.</i>

40:08.515 --> 40:10.713
<i>Is this still correct?</i>

40:10.748 --> 40:13.881
Hey, shit stick!
Never mind where we are.

40:13.916 --> 40:16.081
10 clicks northwest of the city.

40:16.721 --> 40:19.854
<i>-Who is this?</i>
-Ask my sisters, you prick.

40:19.889 --> 40:23.121
-10 clicks?
-10 clicks? What do you mean?

40:23.156 --> 40:28.060
<i>-You!</i>
-Yeah, it's me.

40:28.667 --> 40:30.568
We've got unfinished business.

40:30.603 --> 40:33.263
<i>I know.</i>
<i>About nine pints of blood.</i>

40:33.298 --> 40:36.002
<i>Join us and lose it</i>
<i>before we take it from you.</i>

40:36.235 --> 40:39.544
<i>Your new friends are</i>
<i>invited to donate too.</i>

40:43.242 --> 40:45.781
-What's going on?
-It's Chaos.

40:45.816 --> 40:47.783
One of the minions were
calling him over the radio.

40:48.687 --> 40:50.753
Those were no minions.

40:52.152 --> 40:56.924
I do not doubt
it is Erebus and Nyx,

40:57.927 --> 40:59.630
the sons of Chaos.

40:59.665 --> 41:01.665
Where's Nicole?

41:02.129 --> 41:05.097
-She was just here.
-I didn't see where she went.

41:05.132 --> 41:07.066
She kept going on
about 10 clicks.

41:07.101 --> 41:08.936
It's what Erebus said.

41:08.971 --> 41:11.708
The last confirmed location
they had of us as 10 clicks,

41:11.743 --> 41:13.237
northwest of the city.

41:13.272 --> 41:16.944
Tool up! Tool up now!

41:59.120 --> 42:01.120
Mom?

42:04.257 --> 42:06.125
Mom?

42:33.121 --> 42:34.989
No.

42:47.399 --> 42:51.005
Oh my God. I know that sound.

42:51.810 --> 42:54.338
There's no greater
sound than heartbreak.

42:55.209 --> 42:57.044
Let me go in alone.

42:57.376 --> 42:59.310
What if there's more joiners?

42:59.950 --> 43:02.016
Then I will deal
with the sock head.

43:02.854 --> 43:08.660
I fear we are already too late.
This is the aftermath.

43:20.234 --> 43:21.706
Nicole!

43:31.311 --> 43:33.179
You are the one.

43:41.288 --> 43:43.728
It's okay. It's okay, I'm here.

43:48.460 --> 43:51.769
-How are you feeling?
-Exhausted.

43:53.773 --> 43:54.937
Broken.

43:58.305 --> 43:59.942
I know the feeling.

44:06.445 --> 44:09.688
Why so quiet, Rhodri?
I've never seen you like this.

44:10.889 --> 44:15.353
Just taking a moment,
the calm before the storm.

44:16.763 --> 44:18.224
The end is soon.

44:19.227 --> 44:20.963
It's funny.

44:20.998 --> 44:25.737
One way or another,
I don't see beyond tomorrow.

44:26.168 --> 44:30.940
I've spent so much of my life
being a phalanx knight.

44:31.877 --> 44:34.372
I never got to raise
a family of my own.

44:35.111 --> 44:36.440
We're your family now, Rhodri.

44:37.278 --> 44:40.785
-Even if you're victorious?
-Of course.

44:40.820 --> 44:44.019
You've taken us all on
like three annoying nieces.

44:44.054 --> 44:45.251
Very annoying.

44:48.025 --> 44:51.323
I've spent my life
running from pillar to post.

44:52.062 --> 44:55.129
I spent most of the plague era
constantly running.

44:55.164 --> 44:57.164
I've never been close to anyone,

44:58.838 --> 45:02.070
but now I feel
like I finally belong.

45:03.040 --> 45:06.877
Those girls might be a pain
in the ass, especially Alina,

45:07.979 --> 45:09.814
but we're going
into battle together.

45:10.575 --> 45:12.113
They're my sisters now.

45:13.479 --> 45:15.380
Pain in the ass am I?

45:25.865 --> 45:27.392
Nicole?

45:32.201 --> 45:35.004
I feel odd after yesterday.

45:36.876 --> 45:40.042
I had visions.
I've had them before.

45:40.077 --> 45:41.879
And the power.

45:42.948 --> 45:44.948
I've felt a power within me,

45:45.918 --> 45:48.545
but I felt it come out
yesterday for the first time.

45:51.858 --> 45:54.551
I told you you were special.

45:55.422 --> 45:58.357
You are the one.

45:59.063 --> 46:03.032
I'm working on an old Sanskrit,

46:03.067 --> 46:06.233
but I'm gonna need
some of your blood.

46:06.939 --> 46:08.004
What?

46:09.173 --> 46:14.274
Not much, just about a pint,
but I'm gonna need it now.

46:16.916 --> 46:20.016
-To give you time to recover.
-Fine.

46:20.051 --> 46:24.515
I feel it in my bones,
battle is near.

46:25.485 --> 46:27.892
You think we can defeat Chaos?

46:27.927 --> 46:31.093
If this works, yes.

46:32.591 --> 46:36.461
But it won't be easy where
Chaos can be destroyed.

46:38.201 --> 46:43.534
If your sisters
fail to defeat Erebus and Nyx,

46:43.569 --> 46:45.877
hope will be lost,

46:45.912 --> 46:48.374
and we still have the
joiners to deal with.

46:48.409 --> 46:51.113
Oh, we have a lot to do

46:51.148 --> 46:54.347
-to harness your power.
-Whatever it takes.

46:56.648 --> 46:58.252
Good.

46:58.991 --> 47:00.991
First things first.

47:04.095 --> 47:06.326
It stings.

47:06.361 --> 47:07.624
Worse.

47:14.336 --> 47:15.632
How are you holding up?

47:17.504 --> 47:19.240
Nothing's sunk in yet.

47:20.342 --> 47:22.606
Trying to come
to terms with everything.

47:26.447 --> 47:28.546
Suddenly I'm feeling
the weight of the world.

47:30.715 --> 47:32.220
I can't grieve
for my parents yet.

47:34.422 --> 47:35.960
You'll get your moment.

47:38.129 --> 47:40.426
We'll all get
our chance for justice.

47:40.461 --> 47:42.461
We need to make this right,

47:42.694 --> 47:45.233
so the people we lost
haven't died in vain.

48:20.303 --> 48:22.138
What the hell is that?

48:22.734 --> 48:27.341
A potent mixture
of chemicals, blood,

48:27.739 --> 48:29.981
and remnants of the Chaos realm.

48:30.181 --> 48:31.609
Bright green?

48:32.546 --> 48:35.184
Try injecting
something bright green

48:35.219 --> 48:38.517
into yourself
and see how you feel.

48:39.718 --> 48:42.719
This should destroy Chaos.

48:42.754 --> 48:44.292
How?

48:45.559 --> 48:50.067
Think of it
like a junkie needing a fix

48:51.268 --> 48:53.565
but massively overdosing.

48:55.734 --> 48:59.010
One element alone
will not harm him,

48:59.705 --> 49:05.544
but combined in concentrated
doses should destroy him.

49:07.482 --> 49:11.088
The chromosomes
in your blood is the key.

49:13.785 --> 49:18.359
You will need to inject
this into Chaos's bloodstream.

49:18.394 --> 49:19.657
How?

49:20.429 --> 49:24.266
Through the back of the neck.
It's the only way.

49:26.303 --> 49:30.371
Well, there is one other way.

49:30.406 --> 49:31.570
What?

49:33.079 --> 49:36.311
Believe me,
you don't wanna know.

49:37.446 --> 49:39.083
Go for the neck.

49:43.221 --> 49:44.517
- Okay.

49:47.621 --> 49:49.390
What's up?

49:51.427 --> 49:53.229
I want you to help me.

49:54.166 --> 49:57.200
Help me harness
and control my power.

49:58.467 --> 50:00.269
Okay.

50:05.573 --> 50:08.541
I'm confused. What are we doing?

50:10.710 --> 50:13.513
-Knock me over.
-What?

50:13.548 --> 50:15.647
From 20 feet away.

50:15.682 --> 50:19.123
You want me to knock you
over from 20 feet away?

50:20.159 --> 50:22.456
So how the hell
do I knock you over?

50:22.491 --> 50:27.494
Focus on me.
Now close your eyes.

50:29.300 --> 50:34.435
Picture your target.
Feel your energy grow.

50:35.801 --> 50:39.836
Your Nike blood, do not fear it.

50:39.871 --> 50:42.476
Embrace it.

50:42.511 --> 50:47.547
Control it!
Send its energy to your hands.

50:52.389 --> 50:53.586
Now strike!

51:03.664 --> 51:06.830
Shit, Rhodri! Jesus.

51:06.865 --> 51:08.832
Rhodri, are you okay?

51:08.867 --> 51:10.735
Again!

51:51.514 --> 51:53.151
No!

52:08.762 --> 52:11.433
Delicious.

52:13.998 --> 52:15.800
Enough games.

52:17.969 --> 52:19.870
Ready yourselves.

52:19.905 --> 52:24.545
Go to the city, await the enemy,
and lead them here.

52:24.580 --> 52:26.778
Judgment day has arrived.

52:28.386 --> 52:29.814
Ah.

52:30.322 --> 52:32.223
-Yes.
-Finally, brother.

52:35.261 --> 52:39.659
-The world is ours.
-No! Mine!

53:22.473 --> 53:25.837
So how do we feel, ladies?

53:26.378 --> 53:29.577
We feel like saving
the world, Uncle Roddy.

53:37.719 --> 53:39.356
Let's do this.

53:55.033 --> 54:01.411
♪♪

54:10.587 --> 54:12.521
Uncle Roddy?

54:13.018 --> 54:15.491
Please don't call me
Uncle Roddy.

54:15.526 --> 54:18.054
Uncle Rods, what will
happen to the joiners

54:18.089 --> 54:19.726
and the earth when Chaos dies?

54:19.761 --> 54:21.398
Will the crops grow again?

54:21.433 --> 54:24.335
The truth is I don't know.

54:25.371 --> 54:26.634
The prophecies say so,

54:27.538 --> 54:30.836
but they are centuries old,
maybe more.

54:31.476 --> 54:33.102
It's just I'm getting
tired of eating Spam.

54:33.137 --> 54:34.774
It can't be good
for my guts, Uncle Rods.

54:34.809 --> 54:36.545
Come on!

54:45.083 --> 54:46.786
Will you be watching over?

54:48.020 --> 54:51.659
No,
I will be right by your side.

54:52.497 --> 54:55.696
If we fail, there will
be no more chances.

54:56.897 --> 55:02.967
You girls, if Chaos
succeeds in becoming a god,

55:04.410 --> 55:07.070
not even goddess Nike
could stop him.

55:07.105 --> 55:08.841
It's too quiet.

55:11.978 --> 55:13.846
Something doesn't feel right.

55:17.082 --> 55:18.389
Um...

55:19.689 --> 55:20.985
What's the plan, guys?

55:22.494 --> 55:25.726
We need to conserve our
energy for the final battle.

55:27.565 --> 55:30.159
More joiners
will descend here soon.

55:34.066 --> 55:35.868
Yeah, definitely. Run!

55:47.013 --> 55:49.046
Shit! We got cornered.

55:49.081 --> 55:50.685
What did we do? We're trapped.

55:50.720 --> 55:53.017
Stand and fight.

55:57.089 --> 56:01.058
Get in! Now! Come on! Now!

56:01.093 --> 56:02.796
-Come on!
-Come on!

56:26.591 --> 56:29.559
What on earth are you lot doing
out in the open at this time?

56:30.254 --> 56:32.892
We are here to stop Chaos.

56:32.927 --> 56:36.698
Chaos?
No, no one can stop him.

56:36.733 --> 56:39.096
I've heard
nonsense of bloodlines.

56:39.131 --> 56:42.033
Unless you've found yourself
descendants of a goddess,

56:42.068 --> 56:45.773
then I suggest you steer well
clear of these dark forces.

56:45.808 --> 56:47.038
Yeah.

56:50.175 --> 56:51.713
What is it?

56:51.748 --> 56:53.649
Have I got
something in my teeth?

56:53.684 --> 56:58.016
These ladies are
descendants of goddess Nike

56:59.954 --> 57:03.153
and humanity's last
hope of salvation.

57:05.927 --> 57:07.795
Oh, right.

57:08.831 --> 57:12.998
Hi, I'm Gavin.
I'm a pub landlord.

57:13.033 --> 57:15.132
Oh my hero, Gavin.
I'm dying for a pint.

57:16.036 --> 57:18.740
I'll get you some
refreshments, shall I?

57:18.775 --> 57:20.742
We have to stay down here.

57:20.777 --> 57:24.174
We can't go upstairs
into the pub until nighttime.

57:24.209 --> 57:25.978
I'll introduce you to me wife.

57:27.245 --> 57:29.245
Three goddesses in my basement.

57:30.556 --> 57:32.182
How will I explain
this to the missus?

57:35.726 --> 57:38.859
-Something's not right.
-I agree. He's a little odd.

57:38.894 --> 57:41.796
Not him, the joiners.

57:42.766 --> 57:44.634
Their numbers
are larger than before.

57:44.669 --> 57:48.902
Chaos must have combed the city
for survivors and turned them.

57:48.937 --> 57:52.840
Then we'll fight our way
through more, but we fight.

57:54.008 --> 57:55.777
We need more than this.

58:00.080 --> 58:02.685
We can help.

58:02.720 --> 58:04.918
You? No offense.

58:05.756 --> 58:08.658
Oh, well, not just us two.

58:08.693 --> 58:11.694
We're part of a wider
group of survivors.

58:11.729 --> 58:14.257
We searched
for fellow survivors,

58:14.292 --> 58:16.226
opening up lines
of communication,

58:16.261 --> 58:18.195
helping each other
with supply runs.

58:18.230 --> 58:21.572
It's been a slow process, yeah?

58:21.607 --> 58:23.299
So we have an army?

58:24.236 --> 58:28.172
-Not quite, no.
-How many are there?

58:30.143 --> 58:35.652
Just us two and our friend John.
He'll fight.

58:40.120 --> 58:41.955
What is it?

58:46.797 --> 58:48.291
Rhodri, what the hell is it?

58:48.326 --> 58:51.129
It is the war horn of Abraxas.

58:51.736 --> 58:53.098
The what?

58:53.133 --> 58:58.235
Chaos is calling us out.
We must follow the horn.

58:59.370 --> 59:01.106
The final battle awaits.

59:01.141 --> 59:02.844
Well, sorry, Chaos, old buddy,

59:02.879 --> 59:05.242
but we've got ravenous
joiners to get through first.

59:05.277 --> 59:06.914
I'll gather the others.

59:07.752 --> 59:10.214
Let us help. We can help!

59:10.249 --> 59:12.920
If this is to be
the final stand,

59:13.252 --> 59:16.594
then we will give
our lives to stop Chaos.

59:17.091 --> 59:19.894
If we sit by, there'd
be no world left anyway.

59:19.929 --> 59:23.260
Either way, we're gonna die.
We might as well fight.

59:24.868 --> 59:29.739
I have a plan.
I will join the survivors.

59:33.371 --> 59:38.781
Lead the charge, clear the path
to the Chaos lair.

59:41.016 --> 59:43.016
What is it, Alina?

59:43.755 --> 59:46.085
It's a suicide mission.

59:48.760 --> 59:50.221
It is the only way.

59:50.256 --> 59:52.795
Alina, our mission
isn't exactly a picnic.

59:52.830 --> 59:55.094
We haven't got time
for debating.

59:55.129 --> 59:57.360
-We're ready.

1:00:07.273 --> 1:00:10.109
This is Night Hawk, over.

1:00:10.144 --> 1:00:12.276
<i>This is John, over.</i>

1:00:12.311 --> 1:00:16.445
-Code names, over.
<i>-Robin, over.</i>

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:19.151
Hi, John, it's Kathy.
You guys good to go?

1:00:19.186 --> 1:00:20.790
<i>Yes, Kathy.</i>

1:00:21.793 --> 1:00:23.188
Great. We're coming out now.

1:00:23.223 --> 1:00:25.157
-We'll storm them.
<i>-See you there.</i>

1:00:25.192 --> 1:00:27.126
<i>Good luck. God speed.</i>

1:00:29.834 --> 1:00:33.198
Sorry, darling.
No time for formalities.

1:00:36.401 --> 1:00:39.677
Forget it.
We're about to go to war.

1:00:45.047 --> 1:00:49.885
Nicole?
You remember what I told you?

1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:51.480
You have the vials ready?

1:00:51.515 --> 1:00:56.991
Yes. I got this, two spares.

1:00:58.324 --> 1:01:00.390
You only have
three shots at this.

1:01:01.195 --> 1:01:03.030
Make them count.

1:01:05.771 --> 1:01:07.133
Ladies.

1:01:12.877 --> 1:01:16.241
It's been my honor
to watch over you.

1:01:24.086 --> 1:01:25.954
Time to kick ass.

1:01:26.253 --> 1:01:29.089
Just make sure you're back
at the house for dinner tonight.

1:01:35.130 --> 1:01:39.396
Ladies, give us five minutes
to clear the streets.

1:01:42.533 --> 1:01:44.500
-And goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1:01:45.305 --> 1:01:47.173
Goodbye.

1:01:53.511 --> 1:01:55.951
Let's tool up and head
for the city edge, girls.

1:02:09.263 --> 1:02:12.099
We might have time
for a little nip of this, girls.

1:02:13.069 --> 1:02:16.334
-Really? You sure?
-Oh, come on.

1:02:16.369 --> 1:02:18.105
It might be
your last chance, Nicole.

1:02:24.047 --> 1:02:27.818
I love you guys.
You're like family to me.

1:02:31.087 --> 1:02:32.482
All I have left.

1:02:37.962 --> 1:02:39.929
Woo!

1:02:41.427 --> 1:02:44.428
All right, let's not go
in pissed, ladies.

1:02:55.606 --> 1:02:58.508
I was gagging for that.

1:03:00.985 --> 1:03:04.052
Let's do this.
Let's go save the world.

1:03:08.256 --> 1:03:10.894
Interesting.

1:03:14.295 --> 1:03:16.097
What's going on?

1:03:17.133 --> 1:03:18.561
They took the bait.

1:03:19.399 --> 1:03:22.202
A group of rebels
have found their way in.

1:03:24.041 --> 1:03:26.107
And what of the Nike whores?

1:03:27.275 --> 1:03:30.540
No news yet, but it looks to me

1:03:30.575 --> 1:03:33.851
like they're sacrificing
themselves to clear a path.

1:03:35.349 --> 1:03:38.218
Brave cattle.

1:03:39.353 --> 1:03:41.254
They'll get
an even bigger surprise

1:03:41.289 --> 1:03:43.025
when they find our new breed
of joiner.

1:05:05.142 --> 1:05:09.573
We've made it, girls.
Let's make sure this counts.

1:05:09.608 --> 1:05:11.707
I wonder what happened
to the others.

1:05:14.481 --> 1:05:16.217
We'll take care of these two.

1:05:16.252 --> 1:05:19.517
You go inside
and you find Chaos.

1:05:19.552 --> 1:05:21.189
Let's do this.

1:06:31.525 --> 1:06:34.427
-God, these joiners are tough.
-Tell me about it.

1:06:53.877 --> 1:06:57.252
All alone? I'm impressed.

1:06:57.848 --> 1:06:59.716
This is the end, Chaos.

1:07:05.559 --> 1:07:09.462
How true, descendant of Nike.

1:07:36.392 --> 1:07:39.756
Seems we have
a new breed of joiner here,

1:07:40.759 --> 1:07:44.365
tougher to kill
but twice the fun.

1:08:50.235 --> 1:08:52.466
No!

1:08:59.508 --> 1:09:02.707
No!

1:10:00.932 --> 1:10:06.639
You have power, but you're
no match for me, girl.

1:10:21.722 --> 1:10:24.987
As your friends fall
and I bring about an end

1:10:25.022 --> 1:10:28.793
to your wretched bloodline,
know this, wench.

1:10:28.828 --> 1:10:31.059
As the world fades to black

1:10:31.094 --> 1:10:34.568
and everything
the gods held dear dies

1:10:34.603 --> 1:10:36.570
as my minions flourish.

1:10:36.605 --> 1:10:40.343
And as you die,
so will I be reborn.

1:10:40.378 --> 1:10:44.545
This is reign of Chaos!

1:11:22.552 --> 1:11:24.750
Goddess power, bitch.

1:12:09.159 --> 1:12:13.568
Did we, did we win?

1:12:14.131 --> 1:12:16.098
We won.

1:14:04.945 --> 1:14:07.616
Hey. I got food.

1:14:19.091 --> 1:14:20.893
You okay?

1:14:21.698 --> 1:14:23.566
Yeah, I'm okay.

1:14:24.228 --> 1:14:27.064
Just thinking
about Alina and Rhodri.

1:14:27.099 --> 1:14:31.266
Me too. Picked some flowers.

1:14:32.236 --> 1:14:34.170
We can visit their graves.

1:14:35.107 --> 1:14:36.645
Did you sleep okay?

1:14:38.682 --> 1:14:40.011
More nightmares?

1:14:42.983 --> 1:14:45.016
They're just nightmares.
