WEBVTT

00:03.636 --> 00:05.674
Cynthia, I am so glad

00:05.675 --> 00:09.511
our niece decided to become a lesbian.

00:09.512 --> 00:11.079
I can't wait to post these pictures

00:11.080 --> 00:12.881
of that wedding tomorrow.

00:12.882 --> 00:15.617
It's gonna make us look
so liberal and sophisticated

00:15.618 --> 00:17.819
on that Facebook.

00:17.820 --> 00:19.588
Joe, you know it
doesn't work like that.

00:19.589 --> 00:21.089
People don't choose to be gay.

00:21.090 --> 00:24.760
Of course they don't.
Who would choose to offend God?

00:24.761 --> 00:28.130
Look, they're going to
a lesbian wedding.

00:28.131 --> 00:30.665
How much progress do you
expect in one afternoon?

00:30.666 --> 00:34.636
Let's just give 'em a
B-minus and move on.

00:34.637 --> 00:37.005
Well, I don't know if I'm-a
be able to join y'all

00:37.006 --> 00:38.640
at that wedding tomorrow.

00:38.641 --> 00:40.475
Bobby, you can't miss a gay wedding.

00:40.476 --> 00:43.478
That's considered a hate crime.

00:43.479 --> 00:45.480
But I hate going to
weddings when I'm single.

00:45.481 --> 00:47.682
It just makes you feel so alone.

00:47.683 --> 00:49.551
Especially a lesbian one.

00:49.552 --> 00:51.819
It's like everybody can
get a girl, but Bobby.

00:53.755 --> 00:54.823
JERROD: Well, Bobby,

00:54.824 --> 00:57.526
I thought you and Nekeisha
agreed to go together.

00:57.527 --> 00:58.760
Yeah, that was the plan,

00:58.761 --> 01:00.662
then she met some dude at a UPS Store.

01:00.663 --> 01:02.852
Now, she's bringing him to the wedding.

01:02.853 --> 01:05.385
Well, Bobby, if you want,
I could try and set you up

01:05.387 --> 01:06.921
with this co-worker friend of mine.

01:06.922 --> 01:11.726
She's funny, smart, successful.
She's even got her Ph.D.

01:11.727 --> 01:12.693
Maxine, you'd do that for me?

01:12.694 --> 01:14.996
Yeah, of course. I'll
text her right now.

01:14.997 --> 01:16.597
Bobby, why can't you
find your own date?

01:16.598 --> 01:18.190
I thought you were meeting
all kinds of women

01:18.191 --> 01:19.264
on them dating apps.

01:19.265 --> 01:21.041
Daddy, I just swiped
through all them apps.

01:21.042 --> 01:23.978
I already did Tinder,
Bumble, SoulSwipe.

01:23.979 --> 01:26.213
Shoot. I'm thinking about
converting to Judaism

01:26.214 --> 01:29.250
so I can join JDate.

01:29.251 --> 01:31.886
Bobby, no. They are going to come out

01:31.887 --> 01:34.822
with a new regular person app soon.

01:34.823 --> 01:38.092
You just keep hanging in there, baby.

01:38.093 --> 01:39.827
Hey. Victoria said yes.

01:39.828 --> 01:42.696
I'm back in the game, y'all.

01:42.697 --> 01:43.998
This is gonna destroy Nekeisha.

01:43.999 --> 01:44.932
JERROD: Wait a minute.

01:44.933 --> 01:47.835
Maxine, your friend
already got back to you?

01:47.836 --> 01:50.171
Yeah, how is it this eligible
bachelorette with a Ph.D.

01:50.172 --> 01:52.873
is free to go to a wedding
at the drop of a hat?

01:52.874 --> 01:54.175
CYNTHIA: Yeah.

01:54.176 --> 01:57.211
Maxine, be honest with us right now.

01:57.212 --> 01:58.845
Does she have herpes?

02:02.850 --> 02:04.685
BOBBY: Now, look here, Mama.

02:04.686 --> 02:07.253
I don't care what she got, okay?

02:08.923 --> 02:10.356
I'm just excited that
Maxine's hooking me up

02:10.357 --> 02:11.692
with one of her hot friends.

02:11.693 --> 02:13.194
Well, hold on now, boy.

02:13.195 --> 02:15.563
You don't know if this
woman is really hot, now.

02:15.564 --> 02:17.198
I mean, come on, Dad, look at Maxine.

02:17.199 --> 02:19.132
She's almost a nine.

02:20.935 --> 02:23.270
I think her friends at
least got to be eights.

02:23.271 --> 02:25.573
Bobby, this is my girlfriend
we're talking about, okay?

02:25.574 --> 02:28.975
Show some respect.
Maxine is a nine and a half.

02:30.744 --> 02:33.581
Well, I don't care how hot Maxine is.

02:33.582 --> 02:35.916
I do know that every
group of pretty girls

02:35.917 --> 02:37.885
always has one ugly friend

02:37.886 --> 02:41.322
to remind them where rock bottom is.

02:41.323 --> 02:43.224
- Patrice is ours.
- Yep.

02:43.225 --> 02:46.660
So, what's up, Maxine?

02:46.661 --> 02:49.630
Is she one of the pretty
ones or are you trying to

02:49.631 --> 02:53.067
set my son up with the short straw?

02:53.068 --> 02:55.269
What? No. My friend's cute.

02:55.270 --> 02:57.271
- Uh-oh.
- JERROD: Mmm.

02:57.272 --> 02:59.607
- Cute, Maxine?
- What?

02:59.608 --> 03:03.042
Well, cute is how you
describe a premature baby.

03:03.844 --> 03:06.847
All right, let's see a picture.

03:06.848 --> 03:09.250
Ugh.

03:09.251 --> 03:13.119
Mmm, she doing a awful lot
of scrolling over there.

03:15.322 --> 03:18.259
Just trying to find
the right one, hold on.

03:18.260 --> 03:20.261
Here.

03:20.262 --> 03:22.263
All right.

03:22.264 --> 03:24.698
Oh, okay.

03:24.699 --> 03:25.865
Wait, wait, I want to see.

03:28.035 --> 03:30.271
Ooh.

03:30.272 --> 03:31.839
What?

03:31.840 --> 03:34.608
Maxine, your friend is hideous.

03:34.609 --> 03:36.877
That is so rude, Jerrod.

03:36.878 --> 03:38.345
Yes, Jerrod, that's rude.

03:38.346 --> 03:41.015
But he's right.

03:41.016 --> 03:44.083
Your friend's face is a real problem.

03:45.352 --> 03:47.720
â™ª

03:53.462 --> 04:00.062
<font color="#FFDF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by</font>
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

04:00.335 --> 04:02.315
Jerrod, how could you
call my friend hideous?

04:02.316 --> 04:04.617
That's so mean and totally unfair.

04:04.618 --> 04:05.652
Beauty is subjective.

04:05.653 --> 04:06.653
No, you're right, Maxine.

04:06.654 --> 04:10.422
Beauty is subjective,
but ugly is universal.

04:12.158 --> 04:14.127
Well, I wasn't gonna say anything,

04:14.128 --> 04:16.029
but if people were
graded like restaurants,

04:16.029 --> 04:19.197
this girl would've been
shut down by the city.

04:22.702 --> 04:24.971
Oh, come on, Maxine. She looks awful.

04:24.972 --> 04:26.606
And you know it.

04:26.607 --> 04:28.007
That is not true.

04:28.008 --> 04:29.876
And looks aren't all that matter.

04:29.877 --> 04:31.711
She is one of
the kindest people I know.

04:31.712 --> 04:33.513
She has a beautiful soul.

04:33.514 --> 04:35.515
Well, so did Mother Teresa,
but I'm sure

04:35.516 --> 04:37.616
she spent plenty of
Saturday nights alone.

04:38.918 --> 04:41.821
It's easy for God to be your only man

04:41.822 --> 04:44.356
when no other one is interested.

04:48.361 --> 04:50.463
Okay, what about you, Bobby?

04:50.464 --> 04:52.565
I've never thought of
you as superficial.

04:52.566 --> 04:55.201
But, if you're so against
going out with her,

04:55.202 --> 04:57.403
then I guess I'll text
her back and cancel.

04:57.404 --> 04:59.205
No. We can't do that.

04:59.206 --> 05:01.339
I guess that would be rude, right?

05:02.508 --> 05:04.444
(sighs)

05:04.445 --> 05:05.978
I'll go out with her.

05:05.979 --> 05:07.275
Oh, that's really great, Bobby.

05:07.276 --> 05:09.048
I think you guys are
gonna totally hit it off.

05:09.049 --> 05:12.217
(flatly): Thanks, Maxine,
for this wonderful opportunity.

05:14.620 --> 05:16.022
JERROD: Bobby...

05:16.023 --> 05:18.257
Bobby, you don't have
to go out with this girl

05:18.258 --> 05:19.625
if you don't want to.

05:19.626 --> 05:22.729
No, no, no, I'll go.
Maybe I deserve this.

05:22.730 --> 05:24.497
(sighs)

05:24.498 --> 05:26.199
If Maxine is hooking
me up with a three,

05:26.200 --> 05:28.634
then maybe I'm a three.

05:28.635 --> 05:31.471
Can y'all be honest with me?
Am I a three?

05:31.472 --> 05:33.072
Bobby, no.

05:33.073 --> 05:37.075
You deserve so much more than
that creature with the Ph.D.

05:38.811 --> 05:41.748
Maxine, why are you trying to
destroy my baby's self-esteem?

05:41.749 --> 05:43.449
MAXINE: I'm not.

05:43.450 --> 05:45.852
I think that Bobby is great
and I think she's great.

05:45.853 --> 05:47.420
JERROD: Yeah, but, Maxine,

05:47.421 --> 05:49.522
this is a family wedding
we're talking about.

05:49.523 --> 05:51.858
I mean, family weddings are
the-the high school reunion

05:51.859 --> 05:53.526
of family affairs.

05:53.527 --> 05:56.229
I-It's where everyone comes
together to judge one another

05:56.230 --> 05:58.698
based solely on how hot their date is.

05:58.699 --> 06:00.700
JOE: That's right, Maxine.

06:00.701 --> 06:04.404
We have always prided ourselves
on being a family of eights.

06:04.405 --> 06:07.039
Now, if this girl comes
to the wedding with us,

06:07.040 --> 06:08.608
looking all busted out,

06:08.609 --> 06:11.911
she could single-handedly
drag us down to a four.

06:11.912 --> 06:14.480
Or-or, or maybe even
a three and a half.

06:14.481 --> 06:18.751
Like what Caitlyn Jenner did to
Bruce Jenner's beautiful family.

06:18.752 --> 06:20.920
Okay, you guys, I really don't think

06:20.921 --> 06:23.756
that society is gonna be
as judgmental as you think.

06:23.757 --> 06:25.391
Of course they will be.

06:25.392 --> 06:27.293
I mean, who do you think
society is, Maxine?

06:27.294 --> 06:29.796
It's us. We are society.

06:29.797 --> 06:31.264
And I don't know if
you've been paying attention,

06:31.265 --> 06:32.732
but we've been saying
some pretty horrible things

06:32.733 --> 06:33.900
about this girl.

06:33.901 --> 06:35.234
JOE: Well, I mean,

06:35.235 --> 06:37.970
in certain ways, society
has come a long way.

06:37.971 --> 06:40.540
Like, we don't care about
mixed race anymore,

06:40.541 --> 06:43.543
but we do care about mixed league.

06:43.544 --> 06:46.379
These days, when it comes to looks,

06:46.380 --> 06:48.514
you expected to stick
with your own kind.

06:48.515 --> 06:50.450
JERROD: That's true.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.452
The other day, I saw a white guy,

06:52.453 --> 06:53.920
like, making out with a black dude,

06:53.921 --> 06:55.955
and the only thing that
stood out about them?

06:55.956 --> 06:58.723
One of those dudes was way
hotter than the other one.

07:00.660 --> 07:02.128
Well, which one?

07:02.129 --> 07:05.363
Was it the black one?
I hope it was the black one.

07:06.732 --> 07:10.036
So you mean to tell me
people are gonna be judging me

07:10.037 --> 07:12.238
if I bring Maxine's
friend to this wedding?

07:12.239 --> 07:16.275
Son, I already think less of
you for even considering it.

07:16.276 --> 07:18.478
Bobby, people will be happy for you

07:18.479 --> 07:20.580
if they see that you
are happy with her.

07:20.581 --> 07:22.348
Hey, everybody. I want you all to meet

07:22.349 --> 07:24.083
my date to the lesbian wedding.

07:24.084 --> 07:26.819
Todd, he fine as hell.

07:26.820 --> 07:29.222
Go ahead, take it all in.

07:29.223 --> 07:33.158
(squealing): Oh! Nekeisha!

07:35.828 --> 07:38.965
Todd, Todd, this is my
ex-husband and his family.

07:38.966 --> 07:41.167
Hi, everyone. Really nice to meet you.

07:41.168 --> 07:43.302
All right, everybody,
it's time to see his abs.

07:43.303 --> 07:45.538
Todd, go ahead and lift up your shirt

07:45.539 --> 07:47.740
and show them your abs.
Show them the goods.

07:47.741 --> 07:49.008
Hey, hey, ain't nobody trying

07:49.009 --> 07:50.676
to see dude abs like that, Nekeisha.

07:50.677 --> 07:52.111
Yeah, I-it's degrading.

07:52.112 --> 07:56.382
You two, don't be rude to the guest.

07:56.383 --> 07:59.018
Nekeisha, I don't know if
it's appropriate for me to...

07:59.019 --> 08:01.487
Lift up your shirt
and show them your abs.

08:01.488 --> 08:04.056
I'm not gonna ask you again.

08:04.057 --> 08:05.925
(sighs) You're right.

08:05.926 --> 08:06.993
CYNTHIA: Ooh!

08:06.994 --> 08:08.294
(squeals)

08:08.295 --> 08:11.497
Nekeisha! Ooh.

08:11.498 --> 08:14.599
Todd, you must work
really hard for those.

08:15.768 --> 08:17.270
Do you need anything?

08:17.271 --> 08:18.671
Could I get you an energy drink?

08:18.672 --> 08:21.641
Um, some lemon meringue pie?

08:21.642 --> 08:23.809
We got lemon meringue pie?

08:23.810 --> 08:26.678
No, but I can make some.

08:28.614 --> 08:30.883
Actually, we about to go have sex.

08:30.884 --> 08:32.283
Um, Bobby...

08:34.352 --> 08:37.056
I'm not gonna leave a sock on
the door like I normally do,

08:37.057 --> 08:39.357
'cause I'm telling you in
person, right now. Okay?

08:39.359 --> 08:43.095
CYNTHIA: Well, Todd, nice to meet you!

08:43.096 --> 08:45.064
Nice to meet you.

08:45.065 --> 08:47.532
Don't be a stranger!

08:49.302 --> 08:52.104
(whoops)

08:52.105 --> 08:53.940
Ooh, Lord.

08:53.941 --> 08:57.275
It's so exciting meeting new people.

08:58.344 --> 09:01.681
Well, Todd settles it.

09:01.682 --> 09:04.549
Maxine, I can't take your
ugly friend to the wedding.

09:06.619 --> 09:08.621
Well, I hope you guys are happy.

09:08.622 --> 09:10.756
You made Bobby so self-conscious
that now he's missing out

09:10.757 --> 09:13.426
on what could have been
a great relationship.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.827
Just being honest, Maxine.

09:14.828 --> 09:16.963
Yeah, well, "being honest"
is why so many women

09:16.964 --> 09:19.899
have body image issues and hate
the way they look all the time.

09:19.900 --> 09:23.869
I can't believe how superficial
and small-minded you all are.

09:23.870 --> 09:26.372
Well, Maxine, that's
easy for you to say.

09:26.373 --> 09:28.374
What is that supposed to mean?

09:28.375 --> 09:29.809
JERROD: Well,

09:29.810 --> 09:32.311
Maxine, with all due respect,

09:32.312 --> 09:34.580
you have no perspective on any
of this because you're beautiful

09:34.581 --> 09:36.582
and your life has been
a cakewalk because of it.

09:36.583 --> 09:40.286
But, again, that's
with all due respect.

09:40.287 --> 09:42.955
You think my life has been a cakewalk?

09:42.956 --> 09:46.191
Well, she was born rich, too,
but we not gonna bring that up.

09:48.027 --> 09:50.029
I mean, it is rather condescending

09:50.030 --> 09:52.098
the way you walk around
looking like that,

09:52.099 --> 09:55.533
acting like you the Martin
Luther King Jr. of ugly people.

09:57.370 --> 10:00.373
Okay. This is, this is totally unfair.

10:00.374 --> 10:02.274
I have never used my looks

10:02.275 --> 10:04.744
to get anything in life, big or small.

10:04.745 --> 10:06.145
Even when a guy I don't know

10:06.146 --> 10:08.214
offers to buy me drinks
at a bar, I decline.

10:08.215 --> 10:10.182
Yeah, but let's not be naive

10:10.183 --> 10:12.752
and pretend you don't enjoy
the perks of being beautiful.

10:12.753 --> 10:14.520
Like what?

10:14.521 --> 10:15.955
Like, when we go to parties,

10:15.956 --> 10:18.057
you ever notice how hard
guys laugh at your jokes?

10:18.058 --> 10:22.127
No. I think that people laugh
the appropriate amount.

10:23.396 --> 10:26.866
So you think you funny?

10:26.867 --> 10:28.768
No. I don't...

10:28.769 --> 10:30.936
I don't think I'm the
funniest person in the world,

10:30.937 --> 10:32.972
but I think that I have my moments.

10:32.973 --> 10:35.707
Okay, then, say something funny.

10:37.643 --> 10:39.345
Well, no one can say something funny

10:39.346 --> 10:40.846
when they're put on the spot.

10:40.847 --> 10:43.214
That wasn't funny at all, Maxine.

10:45.718 --> 10:47.753
You know something?
When a beautiful woman sneezes

10:47.754 --> 10:50.022
and she don't cover her mouth,

10:50.023 --> 10:52.724
I don't mind if a little
sneeze get on me.

10:56.595 --> 10:59.352
Look, l-let's face it, your life
would be completely different

10:59.353 --> 11:00.466
if you weren't attractive.

11:00.467 --> 11:02.134
I mean, we wouldn't be together.

11:02.135 --> 11:03.335
You would have never gotten

11:03.336 --> 11:05.805
that low interest rate on your car.

11:05.806 --> 11:07.907
- We probably...
- We wouldn't be together?

11:07.908 --> 11:10.309
What, Maxine? I mean, I
didn't notice your intellect

11:10.310 --> 11:12.477
and ambition from across the room.

11:13.345 --> 11:14.914
Okay, so you're dating me

11:14.915 --> 11:16.782
- because of what I look like?
- No, no.

11:16.783 --> 11:19.585
No. I started dating you
'cause of what you look like.

11:19.586 --> 11:22.188
I also slept with you
for that same reason.

11:22.189 --> 11:24.724
But somewhere around,

11:24.725 --> 11:26.092
I don't know, week ten,

11:26.093 --> 11:28.828
I really started enjoying
you as a person.

11:28.829 --> 11:30.930
It took you ten weeks

11:30.931 --> 11:33.164
to figure out that
I'm a good human being?

11:33.999 --> 11:36.167
Damn, Jerrod.

11:38.003 --> 11:41.273
Well, her looks are very distracting.

11:41.274 --> 11:43.242
Look, Maxine, I think it's
great that you're hot enough

11:43.243 --> 11:46.145
to not need a good personality
but you still have one anyway.

11:46.146 --> 11:48.514
I mean, your personality

11:48.515 --> 11:51.550
is like finding a hundred
dollar bill in a box of donuts.

11:51.551 --> 11:53.819
I would have been happy
with just the donuts.

11:53.820 --> 11:55.521
Do you know how offensive it is

11:55.522 --> 11:57.223
to tell someone that their mind

11:57.224 --> 11:59.225
is just a little extra bonus?

11:59.226 --> 12:00.993
It's dismissive and belittling

12:00.994 --> 12:02.995
that you think I'm defined
by my looks, Jerrod.

12:02.996 --> 12:06.532
No, no, Maxine. I don't think
you're defined by your looks.

12:06.533 --> 12:09.634
Everyone thinks that.

12:12.588 --> 12:15.988
Maxine, come on. We can't be
late for a lesbian wedding.

12:16.142 --> 12:19.378
Who knows when those laws
are gonna change again?

12:19.379 --> 12:22.981
All right, I'm ready.

12:22.982 --> 12:24.349
Maxine, why you look like

12:24.350 --> 12:26.217
you only got six months left to live?

12:27.786 --> 12:30.355
I realized that I play a part

12:30.356 --> 12:32.324
in this superficial world
we're living in,

12:32.325 --> 12:35.961
by wearing makeup and fancy
clothes, doing my hair.

12:35.962 --> 12:37.896
I was just telling society
that they were right

12:37.897 --> 12:39.731
to judge me by my looks.

12:39.732 --> 12:42.567
Okay. I get it.
You're trying to prove a point,

12:42.568 --> 12:45.137
but, Maxine, this isn't
the day to do that, okay?

12:45.138 --> 12:46.738
Now, will you please go in there,

12:46.739 --> 12:48.707
put on a nice dress
and some high heels,

12:48.708 --> 12:51.310
and, you know, let's go to the wedding.

12:51.311 --> 12:52.945
Why do you want me to change?

12:52.946 --> 12:54.846
You gonna be embarrassed
to be seen with me?

12:54.847 --> 12:57.349
Yeah.

12:57.350 --> 12:58.717
Yeah. I am. Of course

12:58.718 --> 13:00.719
I'm gonna be embarrassed.
I mean, look at you.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.287
Maxine, you look like a disciple.

13:02.288 --> 13:03.754
I-I-I...

13:04.856 --> 13:07.292
I told my entire

13:07.293 --> 13:09.294
extended family how hot you are. Okay?

13:09.295 --> 13:11.196
I said you were a nine
and a half, emphatically.

13:11.197 --> 13:12.998
You're gonna make me look like a liar.

13:12.999 --> 13:15.600
I bet my Uncle Pete $200.

13:15.601 --> 13:18.270
Jerrod, this isn't about you.
I'm very serious about this.

13:18.271 --> 13:21.373
I don't want to be judged
on my appearance anymore.

13:21.374 --> 13:23.942
And, if I'm gonna be
meeting your entire family,

13:23.943 --> 13:27.512
I really want it to be all about
connection and conversation.

13:27.513 --> 13:29.081
Okay, Maxine.

13:29.082 --> 13:31.049
(sighs) I've never said this to you

13:31.050 --> 13:34.286
and I feel really
vulnerable saying it, okay?

13:34.287 --> 13:38.824
But, you are my biggest accomplishment.

13:38.825 --> 13:41.760
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

13:41.761 --> 13:43.929
'Cause you're talking
about me like I'm a trophy.

13:43.930 --> 13:45.461
Yeah, what's wrong
with trophies, Maxine?

13:45.462 --> 13:46.429
People love trophies.

13:46.430 --> 13:48.931
- People work hard for trophies, okay?
- Okay.

13:48.932 --> 13:51.167
Look, I think that you are
smart, I think you're kind,

13:51.168 --> 13:52.568
I think you have a big heart, etc.

13:52.569 --> 13:54.837
Now, will please go
back into the bedroom

13:54.838 --> 13:58.274
and turn yourself into the
award I worked so hard to win?

13:58.275 --> 14:01.444
Nope. We're leaving.

14:01.445 --> 14:05.715
Well, if you don't do it for me,
Maxine, do it for gay people.

14:05.716 --> 14:08.251
Come on. Maxine! Maxine?

14:08.252 --> 14:10.720
You love gay people!
That's one of the things that

14:10.721 --> 14:13.755
makes you such a good person
on the inside or whatever.

14:21.931 --> 14:25.535
I hope the Lord is too
busy to know I'm here.

14:25.536 --> 14:27.503
Well, I'm excited.

14:27.504 --> 14:29.639
After I watch this lesbian wedding,

14:29.640 --> 14:32.475
I don't think I can go back
to a heterosexual one at all.

14:32.476 --> 14:36.012
I mean, that's not inspiring.
You got to give me something.

14:36.013 --> 14:39.215
A man and a man, a transgender
and a regular gender.

14:39.216 --> 14:41.551
Hell, I'd even watch
two dogs get married

14:41.552 --> 14:43.152
if they're wearing outfits.

14:43.153 --> 14:45.588
I mean, this is 2017.

14:45.589 --> 14:46.722
At this point,

14:46.723 --> 14:48.624
a man and a woman,
that just seems wrong.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.393
Hmm.

14:50.394 --> 14:54.263
Well, I just hope one of the
brides is not wearing a tuxedo.

14:54.264 --> 14:56.466
I mean, two women getting
married, that's one thing,

14:56.467 --> 14:59.368
but a lady in a tux,
that's going too far.

14:59.369 --> 15:01.370
Hey, y'all.

15:01.371 --> 15:03.639
Todd flaked on me, so
I'm stuck with Bobby.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.175
The beautiful people's
flakiness allowed me

15:06.176 --> 15:08.977
to be the man that women settle for.

15:12.448 --> 15:15.852
Maxine, what are you wearing
to my niece's wedding?

15:15.853 --> 15:18.019
You look like a runaway slave.

15:23.025 --> 15:25.661
You supposed to bring our ratings up.

15:25.662 --> 15:27.797
This is like when your star quarterback

15:27.798 --> 15:29.899
shows up in a wheelchair.

15:29.900 --> 15:33.135
Maxine, is this some
sort of silent protest?

15:33.136 --> 15:35.638
I thought you loved gay people.

15:35.639 --> 15:37.106
All right, look, Maxine, you got to be

15:37.107 --> 15:39.141
on the right side of
history on this one.

15:39.142 --> 15:42.578
I'm not protesting anything.
I'm just being me.

15:42.579 --> 15:44.253
Are you sure you not protesting?

15:44.254 --> 15:46.306
'Cause the only way that I
would wear what you're wearing

15:46.307 --> 15:47.786
is if I thought that
I was gonna get hit

15:47.787 --> 15:50.055
with a fire hose at some
point during the day.

15:50.056 --> 15:51.290
BOBBY: Ah, there she is, y'all.

15:51.291 --> 15:53.359
It's Aunt Clarice!

15:53.360 --> 15:55.361
- CYNTHIA: Oh...
- Can y'all believe it?

15:55.362 --> 15:57.930
My baby's getting married.

15:57.931 --> 15:59.565
(chuckles) Hey, Aunt Clarice.
It's been forever.

15:59.566 --> 16:00.999
Oh, hey.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.470
Is this that girlfriend
I heard so much about?

16:04.471 --> 16:06.671
(flatly): Yeah, this is Maxine.

16:08.474 --> 16:11.944
(clicks tongue) You are just stunning.

16:11.945 --> 16:14.246
- What a natural beauty.
- (chuckles)

16:14.247 --> 16:16.682
You're way prettier than that
queer my daughter's marrying.

16:16.683 --> 16:18.951
Clarice!

16:18.952 --> 16:21.587
I know. I still got a long way to go

16:21.588 --> 16:24.390
accepting this choice she's made.

16:24.391 --> 16:26.558
Well, I guess I'll get in
and watch my daughter

16:26.559 --> 16:28.860
kiss a woman for some reason.

16:29.928 --> 16:34.032
Hey, see you in there, Aunt Clarice!

16:34.033 --> 16:35.853
Look, that's crazy.
She thought you were pretty.

16:35.854 --> 16:36.688
Y'all see that?

16:36.689 --> 16:38.456
She was lying. You look terrible.

16:38.457 --> 16:39.756
You're embarrassing.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.061
Well, the whole point is:
it's not supposed to matter

16:44.062 --> 16:45.830
what I look like, so you
should be embarrassed

16:45.831 --> 16:46.998
for being embarrassed.

16:46.999 --> 16:48.132
BOBBY: Uh-oh.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.001
Here he is, y'all. Uncle Pete!

16:50.002 --> 16:52.470
Hey, y'all.

16:52.471 --> 16:55.706
Wait a minute. Is this Maxine?

16:55.707 --> 16:56.908
Yeah.

16:56.909 --> 16:59.577
Damn!

16:59.578 --> 17:02.780
All right, a bet's a bet.

17:02.781 --> 17:05.816
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm. Look at this girl.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.551
Are you sure you
ain't a prostitute that

17:07.553 --> 17:10.253
he picked up to come over
here and try and win a bet?

17:10.255 --> 17:13.824
No. What kind of prostitute
dresses like this?

17:13.825 --> 17:17.028
All right.

17:17.029 --> 17:19.430
Congratulations, Jerrod.

17:19.431 --> 17:21.365
But if I find out she's a prostitute,

17:21.366 --> 17:24.233
I'm-a come back for my damn money.

17:27.805 --> 17:29.941
See you in there, Uncle Pete!

17:29.942 --> 17:32.143
Maxine, this is crazy. You're so hot,

17:32.144 --> 17:35.980
you can't even make yourself
look ugly even when you try.

17:35.981 --> 17:37.815
I'm not trying to look ugly.

17:37.816 --> 17:40.751
The whole point of this is to
just not be focused on looks.

17:40.752 --> 17:41.953
(Bobby laughs)

17:41.954 --> 17:45.723
Look who it is, y'all.
It's Cousin Demarquill.

17:45.724 --> 17:47.758
Oh, right.

17:47.759 --> 17:48.960
How much we bet? A hundred?

17:48.961 --> 17:50.595
Yeah, yeah, and...

17:50.596 --> 17:53.798
she's not even wearing makeup.

17:53.799 --> 17:56.233
Yeah, and "she" also has a name.

17:56.234 --> 17:59.537
And a personality.
And a master's degree.

17:59.538 --> 18:01.805
Yeah, we didn't bet
on any of that stuff.

18:04.008 --> 18:07.211
All right, see you in there,
Cousin Demarquill.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.880
Jerrod, you making bets on my
appearance is totally degrading.

18:09.881 --> 18:13.851
Why, you mad 'cause you
didn't get in on the betting?

18:13.852 --> 18:16.253
No, I don't want any of this money.

18:16.254 --> 18:17.455
Well, what do you want, Maxine?

18:17.456 --> 18:19.724
I mean, everybody's
saying you're pretty,

18:19.725 --> 18:22.093
and you and I damn well
know that you look like

18:22.094 --> 18:23.694
you just broke out of a women's prison.

18:23.695 --> 18:26.130
Now, I want to be on your side, Maxine,

18:26.131 --> 18:29.299
but I'm not sure what your side is.

18:30.534 --> 18:32.236
Maxine, is all the
attention you're getting

18:32.237 --> 18:34.171
from being beautiful not enough?

18:34.172 --> 18:36.907
Now you need attention
from my whole family

18:36.908 --> 18:40.144
because you're beautiful
even without trying?

18:40.145 --> 18:44.415
Who do you think you are, Alicia Keys?

18:44.416 --> 18:47.718
Okay. Fine.

18:47.719 --> 18:50.287
We're all superficial. Is
that what you want to hear?

18:50.288 --> 18:52.790
I have been complimented
on my looks my entire life.

18:52.791 --> 18:54.859
My nose? It's perfectly symmetrical.

18:54.860 --> 18:57.028
And whenever people ask me
if I've ever had braces,

18:57.029 --> 19:00.264
I lie, because I am too ashamed
to tell them that my teeth

19:00.265 --> 19:02.133
are naturally perfectly straight

19:02.134 --> 19:04.635
and white like columns
of a Roman temple.

19:04.636 --> 19:07.171
And every day, when I get catcalled

19:07.172 --> 19:09.540
or unsolicited phone
numbers on my coffee cup,

19:09.541 --> 19:11.709
I'm reminded of the fact that my looks

19:11.710 --> 19:13.477
are all people are ever going to see.

19:13.478 --> 19:15.346
And there's nothing
I can do about it, so...

19:15.347 --> 19:17.448
Are you happy?
Now, can everyone please just

19:17.449 --> 19:21.252
get over how incredible
I look, for once?!

19:21.253 --> 19:23.721
Damn, Maxine.

19:23.722 --> 19:25.356
Maxine...

19:25.357 --> 19:28.591
that was very, very ugly.

19:30.561 --> 19:34.131
Today wasn't supposed to
be about you, Maxine.

19:34.132 --> 19:38.835
Today was supposed to be
about two lovely young lesbians.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.439
Nekeisha?

19:41.440 --> 19:43.507
Todd, what do you want?

19:43.508 --> 19:45.643
I'm sorry I flaked on you.

19:45.644 --> 19:47.511
Apology accepted.

19:47.512 --> 19:50.480
Now, let's show these lesbians
what they missing out on.

19:52.049 --> 19:54.585
Well, you win some, you lose some.

19:54.586 --> 19:56.085
I'm going home.

20:01.705 --> 20:04.103
Can't believe I said all that.

20:04.104 --> 20:05.872
Am I a monster?

20:05.873 --> 20:08.207
Yeah, a little bit.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.043
But,

20:10.044 --> 20:12.377
you're a beautiful monster.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.148
I just really wanted to believe

20:15.149 --> 20:17.884
that the world wasn't so superficial.

20:17.885 --> 20:21.254
Look, Maxine, I really respect
what you were trying to do.

20:21.255 --> 20:24.057
Okay? And, for what it's worth,

20:24.058 --> 20:27.093
I do value who you are as a person

20:27.094 --> 20:29.762
way more than I do your looks.

20:29.763 --> 20:31.731
So much so, that... (sighs)

20:31.732 --> 20:34.400
if you got in some sort of
disfiguring car accident,

20:34.401 --> 20:36.402
I wouldn't leave you.

20:36.403 --> 20:40.273
But, if you got
some type of brain injury,

20:40.274 --> 20:42.942
and you were as hot as you are now,

20:42.943 --> 20:44.744
I'd have sex with you one last time,

20:44.745 --> 20:46.344
then I'd get out of there.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.315
That's how much I value
your personality.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.586
I'm taking that $300.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.292
Mmm.

20:59.293 --> 21:01.673
You know, if you wore lipstick,
we could have made $1,000.
