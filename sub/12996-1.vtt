23:55.200 --> 23:56.918
Ma'am, it would mean putting
a man in the street,

to control the beetle.

considerable accuracy.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.991
If you agree, Minister,

31:36.640 --> 31:38.073
we could eliminate her.

COLONEL POWELL: <i>We no longer
have a capture option.</i>

35:49.160 --> 35:51.958
Any action on the ground will
lead to an armed confrontation,

35:52.040 --> 35:53.393
which we will not
be able to contain.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.072
They're watching.

35:55.160 --> 35:58.152
Even with the vests,
we need their approval for a strike.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.040
Just tell them we've got
Danford in our sights.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.674
I mean, that alone should
justify using a Hellfire.

36:02.760 --> 36:03.840
The vests are just a bonus.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.354
Danford's a British citizen.
They want her alive.

36:06.440 --> 36:08.112
They cannot have her alive!

Yes.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.397
So, this is no longer
a capture situation.

37:06.480 --> 37:10.598
No. We have two suicide vests with
explosives inside that house.

me to a higher CDE?

37:14.960 --> 37:18.236
Harold, this is a very time-sensitive target.
Do I have authority to strike?

37:18.320 --> 37:19.992
The rules of engagement
you're operating under

37:20.080 --> 37:21.960
only allow for a low
collateral damage estimate.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.508
Yes, yes, and my weapons
only invoke a low CDE.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.511
It's the explosives
inside that house

37:26.680 --> 37:28.591
that bring it to
a potentially high CDE.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.272
And since you know
the explosives are there,

37:30.360 --> 37:32.555
it is incumbent upon you
to take them into account.

37:32.640 --> 37:35.074
I can see a potential
legal objection.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.151
Jesus! We've got two
suicide bombers

37:37.280 --> 37:40.033
and three very high value
individuals inside that house!

37:40.120 --> 37:41.712
And you want them off your
list, I understand that.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.677
But the rules of engagement
you're operating under

not a kill scenario.

have a problem?

38:44.920 --> 38:45.955

Yes, it is.

all right with that?

39:09.200 --> 39:10.315
I'm sure we are not.

There are two British citizens
and an American as targets.

39:13.320 --> 39:14.719

the full support

Yes, a missile

39:19.120 --> 39:20.917
is part of

39:21.000 --> 39:22.479
in circumstances like this.

39:22.560 --> 39:23.879
Do we have
permission to proceed?

39:23.960 --> 39:26.872
No. Such a plan should not
have been signed off by the PM

39:26.960 --> 39:28.109
without the
authority of Parliament.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.351
Operational issues are not
generally discussed at Cabinet,

39:31.440 --> 39:32.680
and certainly
not at Parliament.

I know the protocol.
I'm talking about what should be happening.

39:35.960 --> 39:38.394
Angela, in my view,
all the legal criteria

39:38.520 --> 39:40.192
for an attack
have been met.

39:40.280 --> 39:43.317
Namely, this is
a military necessity,

39:43.440 --> 39:45.670
there is no
reasonable alternative,

39:45.760 --> 39:49.309
and the force to be used is
in proportion to the threat.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.719
That should
answer your question.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.074
It does not, George.

39:52.200 --> 39:55.431
Has there ever been a British-led

42:14.560 --> 42:16.869

42:16.960 --> 42:19.713
But since all the legal
criteria are sound,

42:19.800 --> 42:22.189

ANGELA: Legally
we may be safe,

42:36.800 --> 42:40.918
Given the situation,
that it is a change of mission,

42:42.520 --> 42:46.354
that it is now a missile
attack on a British subject,

42:46.440 --> 42:49.477
two British subjects,
and an American citizen,

42:50.360 --> 42:52.078
and in a friendly country,

42:55.000 --> 42:56.360
I think it is
only right and proper

42:56.440 --> 42:58.829
that I refer this up to
the Foreign Secretary.

42:59.960 --> 43:03.714
Minister, you've heard
the arguments, he hasn't.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.756
And the rules of
engagement mean that

43:05.840 --> 43:07.956
the Prime Minister
has already approved it.

43:08.040 --> 43:09.040
No...
Therefore,

43:09.120 --> 43:11.429
the Foreign Secretary's input
should not be rendered...

43:11.520 --> 43:14.478
No, the point is that
I have not been party

with the Prime Minister

43:16.800 --> 43:18.552

such as this,

43:18.640 --> 43:20.949

undoubtedly has.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.392

you have clearance.

than you see here in this image.

for the CDE to be run again.

54:35.080 --> 54:37.674
I will not release my weapon
until that happens.

54:47.160 --> 54:48.718
We will rerun CDE.

GEORGE: A 65% assessment

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.836
requires us to
do whatever we can

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.751

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.831

<i>We must strike now.</i>

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.437
There is no law covering a

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.519
It's one thing to release a missile
whilst the street is clear

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.875
in the hope that
it will remain so.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.439
It's quite another thing
knowing that

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.272
this girl will,

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.079

be fatally injured

girl is not clouding your judgment.

Dozens of other
little girls' lives

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.833

these men leave.

<i>that the existence of

<i>We are way off what we would

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.236

somewhat different approach

to the question of
collateral damage.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.917

<i>because of one

<i>I realize that this

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.112

<i>here at the White House and at the

That's quite all right.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.315
George, do I understand
this correctly?

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.436
There's a legal
argument for waiting

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.750
and giving this girl a
chance to sell her bread?

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.115
Yes, there is.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.758
But, conversely,
it does not mean

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.632
that there is not also
a legal argument

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.512
for releasing the weapon now.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.040
Forgive me,
I'm not sure that helps me.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.834
Foreign Secretary, there is a
military necessity for acting now.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.311
In our view, they'll be making a
move from that house at any moment.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:04.030
Gentlemen, what action is being
legally recommended to me?

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.032
James, the legal argument
is that we could wait,

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.838
but we need not wait.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.992
And the military argument
is that we should not wait.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.433
Right?
Exactly.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.310
It's my recommendation
that we should not delay

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.351
<i>in proceeding
with this mission.</i>

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.237

we risk losing</i>

the lives of
up to 80 people.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.036
You can only
assume those deaths.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.509
What is certain is
that if we do act now,

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.318
this one girl
will suffer.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.597
And you would save her and
risk killing 80 others?

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:45.715
Yes, I would save
her and take that risk.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.472
That is what I would do.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:51.713
Angela, is it you or me who will
be invited onto the <i>Today</i> program

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.438
to explain why we
knew of the attack

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.152
on a shopping center
that killed 80 people,

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.117
but chose to do
nothing to stop it?

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.269
You, James.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:04.954
But frankly, politically,
I'd rather point to Al-Shabab

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.712
as murderers of
80 people shopping

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.558
than have to
defend a drone attack

kills an innocent child.

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:22.557
James, Angela makes
a compelling point.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:28.231
If Al-Shabab kill 80 people,
we win the propaganda war.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.157
If we kill one child,
they do.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.113
So, we don't do it?

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.839

General, if we go ahead, might
footage of our attack be leaked?

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.953
Sir, the footage from the
Reaper is completely secure.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.837

feel uncomfortable

(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

(MISSILE BEEPING)

(BEEPING INTENSIFIES)

(INTERCOM BEEPS)

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:30.708
COLONEL WALSH: <i>Steve, you need to get
us close in on the remains of Danford.</i>

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.118
Yes, sir.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.273
Carrie, we need to
go identify the body.

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.155
(BEEPS)

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.476
Based on the footage
I'm seeing,

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:16.277
body confirmed as
Susan Helen Danford.

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:23.280
(PHONE RINGING)

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.349
<i>Benson.</i>

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:28.595
Mission accomplished.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.998
<i>Well done, Katherine.</i>

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.278
Thank you, sir.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.518
I'm sorry, Sadd,
I couldn't see any other option.

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.751
Yes, ma'am,
I understand that.

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:58.677
COLONEL POWELL: Now, you will file your
report as a 45% CDE.

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.079
Understood?

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:05.668
Sadd?

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.074
45%.

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.833
Yes, Colonel.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:34.273
In my opinion,

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.791
that was disgraceful.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:43.118
And all done from
the safety of your chair.

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:54.108
I have attended
the immediate aftermath

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:58.628
of five suicide bombings

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.915
on the ground,
with the bodies.

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:10.115
What you witnessed today with
your coffee and biscuits

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.599
is terrible.

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:18.115
What these men would've done
would've been even more terrible.

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.758
Never tell a soldier

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:30.037
that he does not
know the cost of war.

You did well.
Both of you.

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:39.392
Thank you, sir.

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:46.158
You should go home.
Get some rest.

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:49.948
I need you both
back here in 12 hours.
