Sorry, Sam.                     

00:07.600 --> 00:09.000
I can't fix                     
the jukebox here.               

00:09.100 --> 00:11.400
Got to take it back to          
the shop and open her up.       

00:11.500 --> 00:13.300
I'll go get the guys.           

00:13.400 --> 00:17.300
Take it back to the shop,       
            my foot.            

00:17.400 --> 00:20.100
    That's the biggest ploy     
  in the fix-it racket, Sammy.  

00:20.100 --> 00:21.600
  You know they tell you that   

00:21.600 --> 00:24.200
    just so they can jack up    
  the price on you. Trust me.   

00:24.200 --> 00:26.700
      All this baby needs       
     is one swift, good...

01:46.900 --> 01:49.100
Well, what are we gonna do      
      without our jukebox?      

01:49.100 --> 01:50.200
                 The place won't
                    be the same.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.900
No jukebox?                     
I feel naked.                   

01:54.000 --> 01:55.600
Excuse me.                      

01:55.700 --> 01:58.500
  Why are you all mourning the  
temporary loss of this jukebox? 

01:58.500 --> 02:00.300
I mean, you never play it.      

02:00.300 --> 02:01.400
No, no, no, Fras, the point is, 

02:01.500 --> 02:03.300
    it's the perfect height     
          to lean on.           

02:03.400 --> 02:06.000
  Take a look at what it does   
 to the line of my body there.  

02:06.100 --> 02:08.000
Perfect pick-up pose, man.      

02:08.000 --> 02:08.800
              Hi.               

02:08.900 --> 02:10.100
Oh, no, I'm sorry.              

02:10.100 --> 02:11.300
I'm just demonstrating.         

02:12.500 --> 02:13.800
    I'll talk to you later.     

02:15.800 --> 02:17.100
        All right, Sam.         

02:17.200 --> 02:19.000
     But you never play it.     

02:19.000 --> 02:20.200
                Frasier, I never
            play Vera either,   

02:20.200 --> 02:22.400
    but I'd miss her if a couple
    guys wheeled her out of here

02:22.400 --> 02:23.800
        on a refrigerator dolly.

02:28.100 --> 02:30.200
Sam, I should have her back     
in a week, good as new.         
                         A week?

02:30.300 --> 02:32.300
         How can we live without
            our juke for a week?

02:32.400 --> 02:34.000
             Now, don't you have
          a loaner or something?

02:34.100 --> 02:35.600
I'm all out                     
of jukeboxes.                   

02:35.700 --> 02:37.800
How about                       
a cigarette machine?            

02:37.900 --> 02:38.900
Naw, we'd never use that.       

02:39.000 --> 02:42.500
You never use the jukebox!      

02:42.500 --> 02:44.700
Hey, if you want, I could       
loan you a karaoke machine.     

02:44.800 --> 02:46.000
    What's a karaoke machine?   

02:46.000 --> 02:47.100
                          CLIFF:
                         Walter.

02:47.200 --> 02:47.900
    May I?                      

02:48.000 --> 02:49.800
              You see, a karaoke

02:49.900 --> 02:52.500
machine is a self-contained,    
uh, musical gizmo               

02:52.600 --> 02:56.000
of Oriental origin,             
much like yourself.             

03:00.700 --> 03:02.200
You know, it plays the, uh,     

03:02.300 --> 03:05.100
well, the background            
accompaniment to popular songs  

03:05.200 --> 03:09.600
so that shower crooners         
like myself can sing along.     

03:09.600 --> 03:12.200
          Oh, Clavin,           
  I didn't know you did that.   

03:12.200 --> 03:13.400
          I'm amazed.           

03:13.400 --> 03:14.000
    That I sing?                

03:14.200 --> 03:16.600
      No, that you shower.      

03:16.700 --> 03:19.700
          By the way,           
your singing stinks, too.       

03:19.700 --> 03:21.100
REBECCA:                        
Hey, you guys.                  

03:21.100 --> 03:23.700
     Look what it says here     
 on my limerick-a-day calendar. 

03:23.800 --> 03:25.300
                     Ohh, let me
                          guess.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.400
     "There was an old maid     
          named Becks           

03:27.500 --> 03:29.100
      who went a long time      
         without sex."          

03:31.200 --> 03:32.400
Carla, why does your humor      

03:32.400 --> 03:34.100
      always have to be at      
    someone else's expense?     

03:34.100 --> 03:36.200
  That's what makes me laugh.   

03:37.600 --> 03:40.000
     Well, for those of you     
          who do care,          

03:40.100 --> 03:42.400
            Robin gets out of   
            prison on Monday.   

03:42.400 --> 03:43.800
Oh...                           

03:43.800 --> 03:44.900
well, that's great, great.      

03:45.000 --> 03:47.300
     But aren't you kind of     
forgetting something important? 

03:47.400 --> 03:48.300
                     No, no, no.
                 No, I remember,

03:48.400 --> 03:49.300
                 I r... we won't
                 have any money.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.600
                We'll have to   
                 start all over.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.400
        No, no, no, no,         

03:51.600 --> 03:53.000
the limerick, read the limerick.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.100
    I cannot believe you guys   
             are more interested

03:55.200 --> 03:57.600
            in some stupid rhyme
        than in my happiness.   

03:57.700 --> 04:00.000
Well, it's certainly not true   
in my case, Ms. Howe.           

04:00.000 --> 04:01.300
         Well, thank you, Woody.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.000
I'm interested                  
in both equally.                

04:06.400 --> 04:07.900
                    Boy, she saw
            right through me.   

04:08.000 --> 04:09.600
            I'm dying to hear   
                  that limerick.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.100
    Here we go, Sam--           

04:13.100 --> 04:14.900
the karaoke machine             
and some song                   

04:15.000 --> 04:16.399
catalogs to go                  
along with it.                  

04:16.500 --> 04:17.700
        Oh, great.              

04:17.700 --> 04:19.100
      Just what we need--       

04:19.200 --> 04:21.800
        a loud, abrasive        
     noise-making machine.      

04:21.800 --> 04:23.000
                  Fras, come on,
         don't pick on something

04:23.100 --> 04:25.400
    that can't defend itself.   

04:25.500 --> 04:29.000
    Thank you, Norm.            

04:29.000 --> 04:31.600
Well, perhaps I passed judgment 
    too quickly here.           

04:31.700 --> 04:33.300
This may have some merit in it. 

04:33.400 --> 04:34.600
It's filled with old standards. 

04:34.700 --> 04:37.800
         It's got, uh,          
  "Someone to Watch Over Me,"   

04:37.900 --> 04:40.700
          "All of Me,"          
    "You Made Me Love You."     

04:40.700 --> 04:44.800
         (music plays)          

04:44.800 --> 04:48.300
     ¶ Lollipop, lollipop,      
    oh, lolli-lolli-lolli ¶     

04:48.400 --> 04:52.500
¶ Lollipop, lollipop, oh,       
 lolli-lolli-lolli, lollipop ¶  

04:52.600 --> 04:53.800
             (pops)             

04:53.900 --> 04:55.100
      ¶ Bah-dum-dum-dum         

04:55.200 --> 04:56.800
     ¶ Lollipop, lollipop       

04:56.900 --> 04:59.400
    ¶ Oh, lolli-lolli-lolli,    
        lollipop ¶              

04:59.500 --> 05:01.500
    Normie, Normie, how does,   
         how does this song end?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.400
I don't know.                   
I think it just kind of         

05:03.500 --> 05:05.500
keeps going till                
one of us drops.                

05:07.200 --> 05:09.100
      ¶ Bah-dum-dum-dum         

05:09.200 --> 05:13.500
¶ Lollipop, lollipop, oh,       
 lolli-lolli-lolli, lollipop ¶  

05:13.700 --> 05:15.300
                     Oh, please!

05:15.400 --> 05:16.700
¶ Lolli-lolli-lolli             

05:16.800 --> 05:18.400
     This is the silliest,      
        dopiest display         

05:18.400 --> 05:19.900
        we've ever witnessed.   

05:20.000 --> 05:21.700
 And if you want to make a pop, 
      you do it like this.      

05:21.800 --> 05:23.500
             (pops)             

05:25.400 --> 05:28.200
      I've got a delivery       
    for a Ms. Rebecca Howe?     

05:28.200 --> 05:29.600
    I'm Rebecca Howe.           

05:29.700 --> 05:30.400
          Here you go.          

05:30.500 --> 05:32.300
        And here you go.        

05:32.300 --> 05:35.800
      Oh, a shiny quarter.      

05:35.900 --> 05:39.100
      Jeepers, this'll pay      
for my sister's operation.      

05:41.100 --> 05:42.800
         Look at this.          

05:42.900 --> 05:44.900
      A single white rose.      

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I wonder what this means.       

05:47.100 --> 05:49.600
      Well, if it means the same
     thing it does in my family,

05:49.700 --> 05:52.200
        you'd better have Clavin
         start your car tonight.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.600
        It's from Robin.        

05:56.600 --> 05:59.100
         "Dear Rebecca,         
    I'll be free on Monday.     

05:59.100 --> 06:00.500
    "If you're free as well,    

06:00.600 --> 06:03.300
would you care to join me       
      in holy matrimony?"       

06:05.300 --> 06:06.900
          Oh, my God.           

06:08.400 --> 06:12.700
      This is a proposal!       

06:14.100 --> 06:20.400
         In three days,         
I'm gonna be Mrs. Robin Colcord.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.700
        Yeah, that is a cause   
      for a special celebration.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.300
                  Woody, I think
            I'll have a beer.   

06:28.000 --> 06:30.200
Well, congratulations,          
Ms. Howe.                       

06:30.300 --> 06:33.200
I mean, gosh, you know          
I may not be                    

06:33.300 --> 06:35.200
the most inarticulate guy       
in the world, but...            

06:35.300 --> 06:37.000
                     Wait, wait,
                        wait,   

06:37.100 --> 06:38.600
don't you mean articulate?      

06:38.700 --> 06:40.400
Well, isn't it                  
the same thing                  

06:40.400 --> 06:42.400
like flammable                  
and inflammable?                

06:42.400 --> 06:45.700
Boy, I learned that one         
the hard way.                   

06:48.800 --> 06:50.200
 Honey, I think this is great.  

06:50.200 --> 06:51.900
There's something               
you ought to know               

06:51.900 --> 06:53.300
before                          
you get married.                
                What is that?   

06:53.400 --> 06:54.600
I have this strict policy       

06:54.700 --> 06:56.500
about going to bed              
with married women.             

06:56.600 --> 06:58.300
So this weekend is              
your absolute last chance       

06:58.400 --> 07:00.300
to have me again.               

07:00.400 --> 07:01.500
          I don't think so, Sam.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.700
All right. All right.           
Stupid policy.                  

07:02.800 --> 07:04.100
Uh, how about the weekend       
after that?                     

07:04.200 --> 07:06.000
            No.                 
Come on.                        

07:10.500 --> 07:13.300
Lilith, I can't believe         
you did this.                   

07:13.400 --> 07:15.700
Nobody's ever thrown a party    
like this for me before.        

07:15.800 --> 07:17.600
         Turnabout is fair play.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.400
    You gave me my bridal shower
                three years ago.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.800
Oh, yeah, but Lilith,           
I just threw that together.     

07:21.800 --> 07:24.000
I really didn't put any thought 
into it at all.                 

07:24.000 --> 07:26.600
              That would explain
                     the napkins

07:26.700 --> 07:29.600
          that said, "Mazel tov,
        Si and Effie Kupperman."

07:31.800 --> 07:33.600
I got a break                   
on those                        

07:33.600 --> 07:36.100
when Si Kupperman skipped town  
with his secretary.             

07:36.200 --> 07:37.900
            How lucky for me.   

07:40.300 --> 07:42.900
Boy, these Mylar balloons       
      are a public hazard.      

07:42.900 --> 07:45.700
What do you mean?               

07:45.700 --> 07:48.800
        Well, Mylar is a form   
                 of metal, Paul,

07:48.900 --> 07:51.800
              and if you release
                    these things

07:51.900 --> 07:53.800
              they get caught up
      in the high-tension wires;

07:53.900 --> 07:55.500
              they cause an arc,

07:55.600 --> 07:57.500
      sending a shower of sparks
             all over the place,

07:57.600 --> 07:59.500
         and it... hey, it could
              put out the lights

07:59.600 --> 08:00.600
          of a whole city block.

08:00.700 --> 08:01.900
        All right.              

08:03.700 --> 08:06.200
                        FRASIER:
                      Gentlemen.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.300
     If I may, I would like     
    to propose a toast          

08:08.400 --> 08:10.000
to the woman of the hour,       

08:10.000 --> 08:12.400
 the reason we're all gathered  
 here at this wonderful party.  

08:12.500 --> 08:14.800
    To a very special lady,     
        who, I must say,        

08:14.900 --> 08:17.100
    has a glow tonight          
  like I've never seen before.  

08:17.200 --> 08:18.200
      Thank you, Frasier.       

08:18.300 --> 08:19.200
         Oh, pipe down.         

08:19.300 --> 08:20.300
  I've gotta finish this toast  
        to Lilith               

08:20.400 --> 08:22.000
    or she'll kill me.          

08:22.100 --> 08:23.900
        To Lilith.              

08:23.900 --> 08:27.100
                I'd just like   
                  to say, it's a

08:27.200 --> 08:28.300
        really beautiful day.   

08:28.400 --> 08:30.900
            And this is a really
            nice party and...   

08:31.000 --> 08:32.799
            if I'm ever lucky   
        enough to be married,   

08:32.799 --> 08:34.799
          I hope it's to someone
                  just like you.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.000
                      To Lilith.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.600
This is more attention          

08:42.600 --> 08:44.600
than I got                      
at my own shower.               

08:46.200 --> 08:48.400
Well I'd like to make a toast   
to the bride-to-be.             

08:48.500 --> 08:49.600
                    Mmm?        
      Yep.                      

08:49.700 --> 08:51.300
     Uh...                      

08:51.300 --> 08:53.900
I'd just like to say            
that, uh, you know,             

08:54.000 --> 08:56.200
when, when you and Robin        
first got together,             

08:56.300 --> 08:58.300
none of us thought              
that a match                    

08:58.300 --> 09:02.000
between a billionaire           
tycoon and a, you...            

09:03.900 --> 09:04.800
...you know,                    
would work out.                 

09:04.900 --> 09:06.500
But, uh, this is                
just great, honey.              

09:06.600 --> 09:08.700
I, I wish the two               
of you, uh,                     

09:08.800 --> 09:10.500
happiness forever               
and ever.                       

09:10.600 --> 09:12.700
                     That's very
                     sweet, Sam.

09:12.800 --> 09:13.600
                         Hey.   
            Hey.                

09:13.700 --> 09:15.900
              And I want to make
                a toast, too.   

09:15.900 --> 09:17.900
                     To you, and
                    all you guys

09:17.900 --> 09:19.300
in the bar,                     

09:19.400 --> 09:21.500
         you really stood by me,
             and I love you all.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.000
                          To us.
                  Oh, thank you.

09:23.100 --> 09:25.800
She didn't mention              
my name.                        

09:27.800 --> 09:28.700
         Wait a minute.         
         Wait a minute.         

09:28.800 --> 09:30.000
I'd like to make another toast. 

09:30.100 --> 09:32.800
She's going to bail             
herself out.                    

09:32.900 --> 09:34.600
        To Robin.               
                          Robin.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.200
Strike two.                     

09:37.200 --> 09:38.600
            Wait, wait, wait,   
                 wait. One more.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.500
         I feel like I'm leaving
                somebody out.   

09:40.500 --> 09:41.400
Here we go.                     

09:41.500 --> 09:44.300
                To me, and to   
                my happiness.   

09:44.300 --> 09:45.600
Okay, Frasier.                  
That's it.                      

09:45.600 --> 09:47.500
Get your coat.                  

09:47.600 --> 09:48.900
                And of course   
                      to Lilith.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.900
Oh, Rebecca,                    
you didn't have to.             

09:52.000 --> 09:53.900
Frasier, put your coat down.    

09:54.000 --> 09:55.900
We're not going anywhere.       

09:59.900 --> 10:01.400
        Okay, everybody,        
  uh, give me your attention.   

10:01.500 --> 10:02.700
            A couple of the guys
            have put together   

10:02.800 --> 10:04.700
     a song for the future      
         Mrs. Colcord.          

10:04.800 --> 10:06.600
                         Hit it.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.800
    (high-pitched singing):     
     ¶ Lollipop, lollipop       

10:08.900 --> 10:10.600
¶ Oh, lolli-lolli-lolli         

10:10.700 --> 10:13.800
     ¶ Lollipop, lollipop,      
    oh, lolli-lolli-lolli ¶     

10:13.800 --> 10:14.900
     ¶ Lollipop, lollipop       

10:15.000 --> 10:17.400
     ¶ Oh, lolli-lolli...       
                      Excuse me.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.400
Paul, shut                      
that thing off.                 

10:19.500 --> 10:22.100
My wife is throwing             
a lovely shower here.           

10:22.100 --> 10:24.200
The least you can do is         
show a little respect.          

10:24.300 --> 10:27.200
  Aw, Fras, we're just giving   
     a gift of music here.      

10:28.300 --> 10:30.200
Some gift.                      

10:30.300 --> 10:33.100
 And singing with those stupid  
 voices an even stupider song.  

10:33.200 --> 10:35.000
What's, what is that song even  
supposed to mean anyway?        

10:35.100 --> 10:36.700
        Well, it's, uh,         

10:36.800 --> 10:38.900
      it's about this girl      
        and, uh...              

10:38.900 --> 10:41.700
                    Lollipop.   

10:44.200 --> 10:47.300
  All right, if you must sing,  
    why don't you sing          

10:47.400 --> 10:48.800
something a little more         
appropriate to the occasion?    

10:48.900 --> 10:51.100
      Now, look, here's...      
     here's a lovely song:      

10:51.200 --> 10:53.000
      "Isn't It Romantic?"      

10:53.100 --> 10:54.800
    Yeah, it's kind of slow,    
        isn't it?               

10:54.900 --> 10:57.100
Yeah, you don't get to make     
any funny noises in it either.  

10:57.200 --> 10:58.100
          Yeah, really.         

10:58.200 --> 11:00.600
                He calls that   
                      a classic.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.800
            Well, of course     
            it's a classic.     

11:01.900 --> 11:03.100
        It has a, a rare beauty.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.400
                It's a...       
Yeah.                           

11:04.500 --> 11:05.500
      a haunting imagery,       

11:05.600 --> 11:07.600
an enchanting                   
melody.                         
              Oh, yeah.         

11:07.600 --> 11:11.300
Excuse me,                      
and it goes, Paul,              

11:11.300 --> 11:14.200
      something like this.      

11:14.300 --> 11:16.200
              ¶                 

11:20.200 --> 11:24.200
     ¶ Isn't it romantic? ¶     

11:24.200 --> 11:27.500
     ¶ Music in the night       

11:27.600 --> 11:32.600
 ¶ A dream that can be heard    

11:32.700 --> 11:37.400
     ¶ Isn't it romantic ¶      

11:37.500 --> 11:47.200
     ¶ Moving shadows paint     
    the oldest magic word ¶     

11:47.300 --> 11:53.000
        (Norm and Cliff         
     singing high-pitched):     
 ¶ I hear the breezes playing   

11:53.100 --> 11:58.500
¶ In the trees above...         

11:58.600 --> 12:00.200
             You're right, Fras.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.200
             It is a lovely song
             when sung properly.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.900
                        Killjoy.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.100
            Boy, that's lovely, 
                  isn't it?     

12:12.200 --> 12:13.500
      Yes.                      

12:13.600 --> 12:14.800
This is great "champlagne."     

12:16.500 --> 12:18.900
Did you hear me?                
I said "champlagne."            

12:19.000 --> 12:21.100
      I meant                   
to say "champlagne."            

12:21.100 --> 12:23.200
    (laughing)                  

12:23.300 --> 12:24.600
  I said it again!              

12:24.600 --> 12:25.900
(snickering)                    

12:26.000 --> 12:27.900
                I think maybe   
              you've had enough.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.300
No, no, no, no,                 
I want to make a toast.         

12:30.400 --> 12:32.400
    Please?                     

12:32.500 --> 12:33.900
To "champlagne"!                

12:33.900 --> 12:35.000
    (laughs)                    

12:35.100 --> 12:36.700
  No, no, no,                   
  I'm kidding.                  

12:37.800 --> 12:40.700
To my sweet baby, Robin.        

12:40.800 --> 12:43.900
We may not have much,           
but we have each other.         

12:43.900 --> 12:45.500
Then you don't have much.       

12:48.400 --> 12:50.200
Hit me again, Sam.              

12:50.200 --> 12:51.900
          Oh, no, I think you've
          definitely had enough.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.400
Sam, I'm toasting!              

12:53.500 --> 12:55.400
            You... no, you're   
             toasted plenty.    

12:56.700 --> 12:58.300
     Sam, I'm not               
through toasting.               

12:58.300 --> 13:01.800
  I want to toast love and...   
  I want to toast commitment!   

13:01.800 --> 13:04.400
            And I want to make a
            toast to my whole...

13:04.400 --> 13:07.600
        (sobbing):              
      stupid, stupid life!      

13:08.900 --> 13:10.700
     ¶ Isn't it romantic ¶      

13:10.800 --> 13:12.700
¶ Merely to be young...         

13:12.700 --> 13:15.500
    Shut up and                 
  leave me alone!               

13:15.500 --> 13:17.000
         Hey, would you         
    cut me some slack?          

13:17.100 --> 13:18.600
  I've had no formal training!  

13:28.900 --> 13:31.900
  (mellow swing music playing)  

13:39.400 --> 13:40.800
         ¶ Hey, there           

13:40.900 --> 13:42.400
              Who?              

13:42.400 --> 13:45.600
     ¶ You, with the stars      
         in your eyes ¶         

13:45.700 --> 13:47.700
        (womanly voice):        
     Are you talking to me?     

13:47.700 --> 13:51.600
    ¶ Love never made           
    a fool of you... ¶          

13:51.600 --> 13:54.000
Frasier, it's been two days.    

13:54.000 --> 13:56.100
I think it's time you stopped.  

13:56.100 --> 13:58.200
      In the middle of my salute
              to Adler and Ross?

13:58.300 --> 13:59.400
              I think not.      

14:01.000 --> 14:03.600
                  ¶ Hey, there  

14:03.600 --> 14:06.000
                 ¶ You on that  
                high-flying... ¶

14:06.000 --> 14:07.700
 It's a dangerous combination:  

14:07.800 --> 14:11.100
    a karaoke machine           
  and an obsessive personality  

14:11.200 --> 14:13.800
whose parents used to play      
      Broadway cast albums      

14:13.900 --> 14:15.800
 to drown out their lovemaking. 

14:22.400 --> 14:24.800
                 Still can't get
            a hold of Miss Howe?

14:24.800 --> 14:26.700
No. It's been busy for hours.   

14:26.700 --> 14:28.600
    Well, she is getting married
             tomorrow.          

14:28.700 --> 14:30.100
She probably had a lot to do.   

14:30.200 --> 14:32.800
        Maybe... find something 
                to wear.        

14:32.900 --> 14:37.000
Yes. It's not like              
Si and Effie Kupperman          
left her a wedding gown.        

14:39.100 --> 14:39.900
                (chuckles wryly)

14:40.100 --> 14:41.400
         (imitates cat snarling)

14:44.000 --> 14:47.300
      She hasn't been here      
      for two whole days.       

14:47.400 --> 14:50.100
                    Do you...   
            do you think I ought
          to go see her, Lilith?

14:50.200 --> 14:53.700
I'm going to tell you           
what I tell all my patients:    

14:53.800 --> 14:55.900
      "What do <i>you</i> think?"      

14:55.900 --> 14:57.100
          They pay you for that?

14:57.100 --> 14:59.000
    What do <i>you</i> think?          

15:01.900 --> 15:04.200
 Oh, I don't... I don't think   
        she wants to talk to me.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.700
Wh-Why, why don't you go over   
 and see how she's doing, Carla.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.100
Yeah, great, I'll do that!      

15:09.200 --> 15:10.400
      And while I'm there,      

15:10.500 --> 15:13.100
      you can take my kids      
    to go see <i>Smurfs on Ice.</i>    

15:13.100 --> 15:14.700
                      All right.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.700
                I'll go see her.

15:18.700 --> 15:21.500
     Woody, lock up for me,     
    would you, buddy?           

15:21.600 --> 15:23.800
                 All right.     
            Everybody out!      

15:23.800 --> 15:25.400
                  Closing up!   

15:25.400 --> 15:26.700
SAM:                            
Woody!                          

15:26.800 --> 15:29.100
            Not now.            
         Closing time.          

15:29.200 --> 15:30.700
             Could you be       
            more specific, Sam? 

15:30.800 --> 15:32.400
          I'm not a mind reader.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.000
        (knocking)              

15:41.100 --> 15:42.400
            REBECCA:            
    Hold your horsies.          

15:42.400 --> 15:43.500
    (glass clattering)          

15:43.600 --> 15:45.500
          Here I come.          

15:47.800 --> 15:49.500
                    (banging)   
                         Ow! Oh!

15:55.900 --> 15:58.100
                    Oh, well.   

15:58.100 --> 16:00.900
     You're not the pizza boy...

16:01.000 --> 16:02.600
        but you're cute.        

16:04.200 --> 16:05.900
    SAM:                        
    Ooh!                        

16:06.000 --> 16:07.800
How do you see                  
anything in here?               

16:07.900 --> 16:10.300
            REBECCA:            
        Oh, let me just         
    open those drapes           

16:10.400 --> 16:12.300
          and let in a          
      little light, okay?       

16:16.000 --> 16:17.200
            (exhaling)          

16:19.400 --> 16:22.200
Why don't I, uh,                
turn on a lamp here, huh?       

16:22.200 --> 16:24.000
        (switch clicks)         

16:25.600 --> 16:27.000
        (switch clicks)         

16:28.100 --> 16:29.500
Come on, honey.                 

16:29.600 --> 16:31.000
        (switch clicks)         

16:32.100 --> 16:33.800
        (switch clicks)         

16:33.900 --> 16:36.100
    Click.                      

16:36.200 --> 16:37.800
        (switch clicks)         

16:42.700 --> 16:44.400
                 Boy, you're not
                    going to get

16:44.400 --> 16:46.900
                your security   
              deposit back here.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.300
      You drinking again?       

16:52.300 --> 16:53.300
         Certainly not.         

16:53.400 --> 16:54.600
        I never stopped.        

16:56.100 --> 16:57.600
    There.                      

16:57.600 --> 16:59.400
Now I stopped.                  

17:00.800 --> 17:02.800
    Now I'm drinking again.     

17:06.500 --> 17:08.700
                     So...      

17:08.800 --> 17:10.900
            You want to talk?   

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
 Is this about getting married  
        tomorrow?               

17:13.099 --> 17:14.800
     You gettin' cold feet?     

17:14.900 --> 17:16.200
         Certainly not.         

17:16.200 --> 17:18.500
    I am perfectly prepared     
         to marry Robin         

17:18.500 --> 17:21.800
 and spend the rest of my life  
        with him.               

17:21.900 --> 17:25.500
I'm just not particularly       
     looking forward to it.     

17:30.900 --> 17:33.000
  You know, I don't get that.   

17:33.000 --> 17:35.900
            You know, all you've
         done the last two years

17:35.900 --> 17:38.300
        is talk about getting   
            married to this guy.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.200
Yeah, well,                     
I'll tell you,                  

17:40.200 --> 17:42.600
it is one thing...              

17:42.700 --> 17:46.500
        to love somebody        
  who's serving time for you.   

17:46.500 --> 17:50.300
    It's another thing          
    serving time with them.     

17:54.200 --> 17:57.300
Sam, I haven't even begun,      
    you know, to taste life.    

17:57.400 --> 18:00.300
I mean, I just discovered       

18:00.300 --> 18:02.600
this drinking thing.            

18:05.300 --> 18:07.200
                Sweetheart...   
                      (chuckles)

18:07.300 --> 18:09.400
                I can understand
                 the temptation.

18:09.500 --> 18:14.500
          I mean, after all, I'm
         a recovering alcoholic.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.500
    I'm just not ready          
      for commitment yet.       

18:17.500 --> 18:19.400
         Well, doubt's          
part of any relationship.       

18:19.400 --> 18:22.100
      I mean, look at me:       
    I-I was divorced.           

18:22.200 --> 18:24.100
        You know,               
 I drink for a couple of days,  

18:24.200 --> 18:26.300
and <i>you</i> were an alcoholic.      

18:26.400 --> 18:28.400
 I have a little bit of trouble 
      with a relationship,      

18:28.400 --> 18:30.500
     and <i>you</i> were divorced.     

18:30.600 --> 18:34.200
Do you retain water in the      
 middle of the month, too, Sam? 

18:41.000 --> 18:43.800
                  Look, I'm just
             trying to help you.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.400
            I mean, everybody   
                  gets cold feet

18:45.500 --> 18:46.800
              when they're about
                 to get married,

18:46.900 --> 18:49.900
         but it's a pretty weeny
    reason to start drinking.   

18:49.900 --> 18:51.600
  Why did you start drinking?   

18:51.600 --> 18:53.800
            I lost my curveball.

18:55.700 --> 18:59.200
I am not drinking               
because I have cold feet.       

19:01.300 --> 19:04.700
I am drinking because           
I don't know if I love Robin.   

19:04.700 --> 19:06.900
                      Oh, wow.  

19:06.900 --> 19:09.000
                    Do you think
                maybe you don't?

19:09.100 --> 19:12.000
I don't know.                   

19:12.100 --> 19:16.500
 I just wish I had a little bit 
more time, you know, to decide. 

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
        You don't think         
    there's any chance that     

19:18.600 --> 19:20.900
     that, um, parole board     
    could keep him in prison    

19:21.000 --> 19:23.700
  just a little while longer?   

19:24.700 --> 19:26.700
         Listen, listen, listen.

19:26.700 --> 19:29.500
  If you don't love the guy, why
don't you just back out of this?

19:29.500 --> 19:32.500
    Oh, I'm supposed to tell    
  the richest man in the world  

19:32.600 --> 19:34.700
that I don't want to marry him? 

19:34.800 --> 19:36.600
            No, he's not rich   
              anymore, remember?

19:36.700 --> 19:37.900
         That's right.          

19:37.900 --> 19:39.700
What's his number?              

19:42.000 --> 19:43.800
            Come on. Come on.   
                      Stop that.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.300
         I'm being serious here.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.700
I am being serious,             
too, Sam.                       

19:46.800 --> 19:50.400
It's just that                  
I can't stop remembering.       

19:50.500 --> 19:54.600
    I can't stop remembering    
        that one time...        

19:54.600 --> 19:56.700
         in my life...          

19:56.700 --> 19:59.700
    it was just so exciting.    

19:59.800 --> 20:00.900
            Oh, boy.            

20:00.900 --> 20:03.000
  I know where this is going.   

20:03.000 --> 20:04.500
Oh, God, I loved it, Sam.       

20:04.600 --> 20:06.100
                     Honey...   

20:06.200 --> 20:09.800
It was just so thrilling,       
 and it was magical, you know?  

20:09.900 --> 20:11.600
        I know, I know.         

20:11.700 --> 20:16.200
  And like every single nerve   
     in my body was alive,      

20:16.200 --> 20:18.700
    and I was glowing.          

20:18.800 --> 20:21.500
        God, it was like        
the first time in my life       

20:21.600 --> 20:23.800
 I was one with another being.  

20:23.900 --> 20:27.400
      Once you have that,       
     you just don't forget.     

20:27.500 --> 20:29.800
  I'll never forget the night   
         we made love.          

20:29.800 --> 20:31.400
I'm talking about when I was ten

20:31.500 --> 20:34.100
      and won first prize       
      in that horse show.       

20:38.500 --> 20:42.200
You know, but that sex deal     
was good with you, too.         

20:45.200 --> 20:49.200
I mean, even having sex with you
     is better than Robin.      

20:49.300 --> 20:50.800
        Even that, huh?         

20:57.600 --> 21:01.900
So that's it...                 
isn't it?                       

21:01.900 --> 21:04.000
  I don't want to marry Robin.  

21:04.100 --> 21:05.900
        (sniffles)              

21:05.900 --> 21:10.800
Well, I guess I won't be needing
         this anymore.          

21:20.300 --> 21:22.600
    Right now...                

21:22.700 --> 21:24.800
      I made my decision.       

21:24.900 --> 21:28.000
    Robin is history.           

21:28.000 --> 21:29.700
             There.             

21:29.700 --> 21:31.300
            (sighs)             

21:31.400 --> 21:33.200
         It feels good.         

21:33.300 --> 21:35.400
                     All right. 
Yeah.                           

21:35.400 --> 21:36.500
        Let's celebrate.        

21:38.700 --> 21:41.100
                No, no, we don't
                need to do that.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.800
Yeah, you're right.             

21:42.900 --> 21:43.900
You're right.                   

21:44.000 --> 21:46.200
There is a better way           
to celebrate, Sam.              

21:47.800 --> 21:50.700
Drop your pants.                

21:52.700 --> 21:54.100
                     What?      

21:54.200 --> 21:55.600
You heard me, buddy.            

21:55.600 --> 21:58.800
I... want... you.               

21:58.900 --> 22:00.300
                         Oh, no.

22:00.300 --> 22:02.600
Sweet... sweetheart,            
we-we can't do this.            

22:02.700 --> 22:03.800
        Oh, yes, we can, Sam.   

22:03.900 --> 22:05.700
            The train is pulling
            into the station.   

22:05.800 --> 22:07.300
No, no...                       
            All aboard.         

22:07.300 --> 22:10.800
Whoo, whoo.                     

22:10.900 --> 22:12.800
                  I'm sorry, I-I
                  won't do this.

22:12.900 --> 22:14.400
    Why?                        

22:14.400 --> 22:16.200
             Well, first of all,

22:16.200 --> 22:18.800
            you've been drinking
             a little bit and...

22:18.800 --> 22:20.200
        you know, a gentleman   
                      has rules.

22:20.200 --> 22:24.100
         And second, you're kind
         of repulsive right now.

22:34.300 --> 22:36.300
You can't take it?              

22:41.500 --> 22:43.200
              I'm gonna go home.

22:43.300 --> 22:45.600
No, Sam, Sam, we have all night.

22:45.700 --> 22:47.300
     ¶ We've got tonight ¶      

22:48.500 --> 22:51.200
    ¶ Who needs tomorrow?       

22:52.500 --> 22:56.200
    ¶ Let's make it last, babe ¶

22:56.300 --> 22:59.500
              ¶ Let's fi... nd ¶

22:59.600 --> 23:02.900
                    ¶ The way.  

23:07.100 --> 23:09.000
                Sam Malone...   

23:09.100 --> 23:11.500
      I want you to get ready...

23:11.500 --> 23:14.600
     for the most exciting night

23:14.700 --> 23:16.800
             of your life.
