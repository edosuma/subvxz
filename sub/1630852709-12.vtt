00:09.634 --> 00:11.594


00:11.678 --> 00:13.805


00:13.888 --> 00:15.015


00:23.815 --> 00:25.984


00:32.198 --> 00:34.325


00:34.409 --> 00:37.454


00:38.079 --> 00:40.498


00:41.583 --> 00:45.211


00:47.213 --> 00:48.506
Hyuh!

00:48.590 --> 00:50.216
Hmm?

00:50.300 --> 00:52.051
-
-Uhh!

00:59.934 --> 01:01.019
-Hi, Bomb.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.562
Oh. Hi, uh, Matilda.

01:02.645 --> 01:04.773
Uh… Happy Founders' Day, heh.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.734


01:07.817 --> 01:10.820
Oh, no. I'm sorry. What did I say?

01:11.988 --> 01:16.701
It's just Lynette and Harold asked me
to direct the Founders' Day play today,

01:16.785 --> 01:20.747
but I can't do that
and watch the hatchlings.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.124
I guess the universe had other plans.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.795
My lifelong dream will just have to wait.

01:26.878 --> 01:30.840
Your dream? Well, me and my friends
could watch them for you.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.801
Oh, Bomb.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.470
You are a lifesaver.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.972
Mm-hmm.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.642
Yah!

01:41.309 --> 01:43.394
And… perfect.

01:47.774 --> 01:48.775
Sorry!

01:53.696 --> 01:55.156
Uh, think you missed a spot.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.617
Ugh. You owe me big time, Red.

01:57.700 --> 02:01.996
I need supreme coverage if we're
gonna have our chill day at the beach.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.582
Right. We're gonna chill so hard.

02:07.377 --> 02:11.798
There it is! My tree of destiny.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.299
Uh, everything okay, Chuck?

02:13.383 --> 02:15.802
It's perfect. In fact,
it's better than perfect.

02:15.885 --> 02:19.305
It's burrito extreme-o!

02:19.389 --> 02:24.227
Because I am the great Francis Finch.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.814
You know, founder of Camp Splinterwood?

02:27.897 --> 02:30.525
I'm playing him in the Founders' Day
ceremony today.

02:30.608 --> 02:31.776
Yeah, but it's chill day.

02:31.860 --> 02:35.238
There will be
no chilling today, my friends,

02:35.321 --> 02:38.074
for the stage… beckons!

02:39.033 --> 02:39.951
Hey, everyone.

02:40.034 --> 02:43.538
Oh, I just wanted to thank you,
thank you, thank you

02:43.621 --> 02:46.916
for being such beautiful souls
and doing this for me.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.084
Oh, you're welcome.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.378
I'm sorry. Uh, what are we doing for you?

02:50.461 --> 02:54.549
Uh… I kinda sort of promised
we'd watch the hatchlings

02:54.632 --> 02:57.594
so Matilda can
direct the Founders' Day ceremony.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.180
Aw.
Hey there, cuties.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.224
You are the absolute best.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.935
Anytime you want your chakras aligned,
just let me know.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.437
Chuck, ready to rehearse?

03:07.520 --> 03:12.483
The real question is,
is the stage ready for me?

03:12.567 --> 03:14.444
-Okay, then.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.571
Be good.

03:17.822 --> 03:21.284
Okay, little ones, ready to hit the beach
and chill with us?

03:25.204 --> 03:26.623
Ohh, that doesn't look good.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.051
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

03:38.134 --> 03:41.971
Uh, what's up? Why are they going crazy?
They were fine a second ago.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.140
Hey! Take that out of your mouth!

03:45.725 --> 03:47.602
Guess they're only good for Matilda.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.396
This is gonna put a damper
on chill day.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.025
But this is Matilda's lifelong dream,
and I made a promise.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.526
I can't let her down.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.279
Ah… because you love her.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.364
Ohh!

03:59.447 --> 04:01.199
Come on, Stella. Leave him alone.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.284
-Bomb, we'll do it.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.037
But only because you're so in love.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.414
-Hey, I am not. I just--

04:08.498 --> 04:10.124
Uh, where are the hatchlings?

04:12.252 --> 04:13.253
Uh-oh.

04:41.614 --> 04:42.699
Where'd they go?

04:44.742 --> 04:47.120
Okay, okay, places people.

04:47.203 --> 04:48.621
Oh, I've always wanted to say that.

04:48.705 --> 04:52.125
So at the big finale,
make sure you're all in your places,

04:52.208 --> 04:54.669
and I'll set off the fireworks with this.

04:54.752 --> 04:58.715
Is it my destiny to be flung aside
and forgotten?

05:01.050 --> 05:02.593
They're heading towards Matilda!

05:04.595 --> 05:05.763

Whee!

05:05.847 --> 05:07.724
Whew. Wha-ha!

05:11.019 --> 05:12.770
Well, at least they're back in our bunk.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.356
-Oh! Ow!
-Ohh! Oh!

05:15.440 --> 05:17.692
I know this is important
to you, but-- ow!

05:17.775 --> 05:21.279
We-- oh!-- need-- ow!--
our-- oh!-- chill day. Oh!

05:23.323 --> 05:24.907
-Okay, fine.

05:26.117 --> 05:29.746
Just please, don't make me
be the one to tell-- Matilda!

05:29.829 --> 05:31.456
-Heh. Oh. Uh…

05:31.539 --> 05:32.665
What are you doing here?

05:32.749 --> 05:35.918
We are taking a five,
as they say in "the biz,"

05:36.002 --> 05:37.670
and I just wanted to see how it's going,

05:37.754 --> 05:40.798
and to thank you again
for making my dreams come true.

05:40.882 --> 05:43.009
-I am having the best day.

05:43.092 --> 05:44.719
Oh! You're welcome.

05:44.802 --> 05:47.138
So… is everything okay?

05:47.722 --> 05:51.934
Yah! Y-Yeah, they're just nipping.
I mean, napping.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.436
Oh, bless the stars!

05:53.519 --> 05:56.105
Well, when they wake up,
you should bring them to the ceremony.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.483
Uh, sure. We'll be there.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.942
Okay. Bye.

06:00.818 --> 06:05.114
I couldn't do it, guys.
I couldn't crush her dreams. I'm sorry!

06:07.742 --> 06:11.996
All right, Bomb, we'll do it,
but you've gotta pull it together.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.248
Okay, if we're going to the ceremony,

06:14.332 --> 06:17.293
we need to figure out
how to keep these monsters under control.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.463
Put that down!

06:20.546 --> 06:22.173
No! Bad hatchling!

06:25.343 --> 06:28.346


06:44.487 --> 06:46.280
Okay, it totally worked.

06:46.364 --> 06:49.075
Not exactly what we had in mind
for chill day,

06:49.158 --> 06:50.868
but it'll do, I guess.

06:50.952 --> 06:54.122
During the performance, there will be
no talking, yawning, gum chewing,

06:54.205 --> 06:56.415
and absolutely no smiling!

06:56.499 --> 06:58.459
-And enjoy the show.

07:01.921 --> 07:07.051
Blah! I've just had a vision of a camp
where children will frolic with mosquitoes

07:07.135 --> 07:09.971
and be fed cheap, un-nutritious food,

07:10.054 --> 07:14.809
and at its center, an oddly specific,
U-shaped tree!

07:14.892 --> 07:18.980
Is it my destiny
to be thrown aside and forgotten?

07:19.063 --> 07:20.898
Um, guys?

07:25.736 --> 07:28.322
-Ohh.
-They're gonna wreck the ceremony.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.533
Not if we grab 'em first. Split up!

07:37.331 --> 07:38.166
I gotcha!

07:38.249 --> 07:41.461
Ah, my intrepid team
of plucky adventurers,

07:41.544 --> 07:43.337
I, Francis Finch--

07:43.421 --> 07:44.589
Blagh!

07:44.672 --> 07:48.468
But, Mummy, I don't like the meat pies.

07:49.051 --> 07:49.886
Got one!

07:49.969 --> 07:52.763
There it is. It's glorious.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.515
A tree perfectly shaped

07:54.599 --> 07:57.727
to slingshot campers
in fun summertime activities.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.771
I dub thee the Founders' Tree

08:00.855 --> 08:02.773
on this fine day.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.444
Uh… night.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.487
Uh, day.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.739
Night. Day. Night. Day.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.115
Night, day! Night, day!

08:11.199 --> 08:12.325
-Night, day! Night, day!

08:12.408 --> 08:14.368
-Night, day! Night, day! Night, day!

08:14.452 --> 08:16.287
Night, day! Night, day! Night, day!

08:16.370 --> 08:17.955
-That's two!

08:18.039 --> 08:19.040
I got this one.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.503
Ohh! Aagh…

08:23.586 --> 08:26.339
Away, foul, uh… fungi!

08:26.422 --> 08:27.757
Be gone, I say!

08:32.803 --> 08:34.013
What are you doing here?

08:34.764 --> 08:37.808
I am the red… wood tree.

08:37.892 --> 08:41.270
I'm, uh, trying to find
the magical mushroom…

08:41.354 --> 08:42.396
and there he is.

08:47.860 --> 08:48.778
We got 'em!

08:48.861 --> 08:51.239
No, that's only three. There's one left!

08:52.156 --> 08:53.699
-There!
-I'll get him!

08:58.579 --> 09:00.248
-Uhh!

09:04.752 --> 09:05.795
Ha! Gotcha!

09:12.552 --> 09:13.594
Uh…

09:17.390 --> 09:19.058
-Uhh!

09:33.197 --> 09:34.407
Oh, no.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.747
Uh… the end?

09:44.041 --> 09:46.961
What are you doing on the stage?
You're gonna ruin the play.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.838
Bomb, what happened?

09:50.089 --> 09:52.174
We couldn't control the hatchlings.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.510
Red and Stella told me to tell you,
but I didn't!

09:54.594 --> 09:57.179
And then I blew everything up!

09:57.263 --> 09:58.556
Matilda!

09:58.639 --> 10:03.728
In all my years, I have never
seen anything so… so…

10:05.771 --> 10:08.566
-Amazing!

10:08.649 --> 10:11.444
It's usually such a drag,
and everyone's asleep by the end.

10:11.527 --> 10:15.364
But the mushroom, the pyrotechnics,
the explosions.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.574
Genius!

10:16.657 --> 10:21.454
So, same time next year, Ms. Director, ah?

10:22.872 --> 10:26.167
Bomb, next time
just tell me the truth, okay?

10:26.250 --> 10:27.918
-Mm-hmm.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.504
I don't know why you had
any trouble with them, though.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.173
They are such darlings.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.302
Thank you! Thank you!

10:36.385 --> 10:39.263
You love me. You really love me!
