WEBVTT

00:00.027 --> 00:01.572
Previously on "Station 19"...

00:01.596 --> 00:03.876
Jenna, this is my friend Andy.

00:03.900 --> 00:06.245
Medic One. I'm considering going for it.

00:06.269 --> 00:07.279
You got my support.

00:07.303 --> 00:08.547
What happened between us the other day

00:08.571 --> 00:09.848
can never happen again.

00:09.872 --> 00:11.049
So now you're having second thoughts?

00:11.073 --> 00:12.217
I kept quiet, and you couldn't,

00:12.241 --> 00:13.519
and now I have to answer for it
to your peers.

00:13.543 --> 00:15.187
- They're my friends.
- They're my subordinates!

00:15.211 --> 00:17.350
You have to celebrate the closing.

00:17.374 --> 00:18.392
It's my call.

00:18.416 --> 00:19.825
No, you're too close to this.
The call is mine.

00:19.849 --> 00:22.261
You're my best friend,
but she's my world.

00:22.285 --> 00:24.153
I don't need you
to talk to me ever again.

00:24.177 --> 00:26.965
I want you settled down
with a family of your own.

00:26.989 --> 00:29.123
I may just have to go on a few dates.

00:30.426 --> 00:32.470
When the danger's coming at you,

00:32.494 --> 00:33.705
you need to make a choice.

00:35.097 --> 00:36.708
Where do you focus?

00:38.134 --> 00:39.211
Everything all right?

00:39.235 --> 00:40.646
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.250
- It's a reflex.
- It's okay.

00:42.274 --> 00:43.649
Your mom told me BB all about what you.

00:43.673 --> 00:44.917
What made you choose firefighting?

00:44.941 --> 00:46.084
How do you proceed?

00:46.108 --> 00:47.619
I don't know if I chose firefighting

00:47.643 --> 00:49.188
or it chose me.

00:49.212 --> 00:50.522
Either way, is it your endgame?

00:50.546 --> 00:52.090
Do you run? Uh, what do you mean?

00:52.114 --> 00:53.959
- Do you hide?
- I mean, realistically,

00:53.983 --> 00:56.495
how much longer can you be in
the firefighting business?

00:56.519 --> 00:58.096
Or do you stand your ground and commit?

00:58.120 --> 00:59.698
It's not a business. It's my job.

00:59.722 --> 01:01.433
Your mom said you had other ambitions.

01:01.457 --> 01:03.535
I mean, not that there's anything
wrong with fighting fires.

01:03.559 --> 01:04.937
No, no, there is not.

01:04.961 --> 01:06.538
But you've got other options, right?

01:06.562 --> 01:09.074
Why would I need other options?

01:09.098 --> 01:11.543
I mean, you're not gonna
fight fires forever.

01:11.567 --> 01:12.778
At some point, you're
gonna want to settle

01:12.802 --> 01:14.613
into something a little... safer.

01:14.637 --> 01:16.181
Uh, did my mom mention that, too?

01:16.205 --> 01:18.283
She's such a force, an icon.

01:18.307 --> 01:20.297
- A true inspiration.
- What is it like being her son?

01:20.321 --> 01:21.391
I love her.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.437
- Love her.
- Love her.

01:22.461 --> 01:24.336
- I would love to get to...
- Check, right?

01:24.360 --> 01:25.470
Check?

01:30.720 --> 01:32.998
Whoo!

01:33.022 --> 01:35.534
Oh!

01:35.558 --> 01:36.668
Easy... the coffee!

01:36.692 --> 01:37.903
Ah, who cares?

01:37.927 --> 01:39.872
Well, you will when you taste it.

01:39.896 --> 01:41.073
Mm.

01:41.097 --> 01:43.141
I used my travel milk frother.

01:43.165 --> 01:44.142
Mm.

01:44.166 --> 01:45.777
Mmm! See?

01:45.801 --> 01:48.146
Maybe I should invest in
a heavy-duty one for the condo

01:48.170 --> 01:50.849
so we can sip this caffeinated decadence

01:50.873 --> 01:52.846
over nightly sunsets.

01:54.677 --> 01:56.755
- Pruitt.
- Oh, I'm sorry. That was forward.

01:56.779 --> 01:59.057
No, no, I appreciate you being direct.

01:59.081 --> 02:00.926
And so I will be, too.

02:00.950 --> 02:03.495
I have no interest in watching
sunsets every night

02:03.519 --> 02:04.496
from your condo.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.198
Oh, all right. Then, uh...

02:06.222 --> 02:09.067
I want to watch them with you,

02:09.091 --> 02:11.837
but I want to do it from cruise ships.

02:11.861 --> 02:15.073
Alaska. Tahiti. Greece.

02:15.097 --> 02:17.576
Or from my son's house in Oregon.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.812
Have you ever seen an Oregon sunset?

02:20.836 --> 02:22.052
I have not.

02:22.076 --> 02:24.716
They are breathtaking.

02:24.740 --> 02:27.286
Seattle FD has, uh,

02:27.310 --> 02:29.755
been my life for a really long time.

02:29.779 --> 02:31.957
It's also kept me tied down here.

02:31.981 --> 02:35.527
Well, then, maybe it's time
for you to free yourself up.

02:36.819 --> 02:41.366
Hawaii Air runs a 7:45 flight to Kauai.

02:41.390 --> 02:43.001
Let's hop it.

02:43.025 --> 02:45.437
- Celebrate you selling the house.
- Uh...

02:45.461 --> 02:46.772
Hey, Dad?

02:46.796 --> 02:47.940
You got a minute? I was just...

02:47.964 --> 02:49.196
- M'ija.
- Oh.

02:50.366 --> 02:51.944
Hi. Hello.

02:51.968 --> 02:52.911
Hi.

02:52.935 --> 02:54.880
Uh, uh, this is Reggie.

02:54.904 --> 02:56.515
Real estate agent Reggie?

02:58.107 --> 03:00.385
You must be Andy.

03:00.409 --> 03:01.552
Pleasure.

03:01.576 --> 03:02.854
Yes.

03:02.878 --> 03:03.889
I was just swinging by

03:03.913 --> 03:05.624
to see the old place one last time.

03:05.648 --> 03:08.360
I didn't realize you were... busy.

03:08.384 --> 03:10.529
Stay for coffee?

03:10.553 --> 03:12.364
Reggie brought her milk frother.

03:12.388 --> 03:14.499
No, no time for frothing.

03:14.523 --> 03:16.018
Work time. Shift time.

03:16.042 --> 03:18.070
Don't wanna be late. Okay, bye!

03:22.932 --> 03:25.210
That didn't sound like a
"where's the fluffy cat" sneeze.

03:25.234 --> 03:26.745
It sounded like an "I'm patient zero

03:26.769 --> 03:28.347
and need to go home right now" sneeze.

03:28.371 --> 03:31.617
No, it was just a regular
textbook sneeze, sneeze.

03:32.708 --> 03:33.919
You should go.

03:33.943 --> 03:35.087
No, I don't want to go home.

03:35.111 --> 03:37.589
I still have one of
Ripley's T-shirts there.

03:37.613 --> 03:39.258
- Okay?
- Oh, God.

03:39.282 --> 03:40.459
He accidentally left it,

03:40.483 --> 03:42.531
and, oh, my God, it smells so good,

03:42.562 --> 03:43.996
but now I don't know what to do with it,

03:44.020 --> 03:46.264
and if I go, I have to decide.

03:46.288 --> 03:48.667
Deciding sounds... important.

03:48.691 --> 03:50.024
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:50.048 --> 03:52.204
So you should go home to decide.

03:52.228 --> 03:54.806
Okay, if I give the T-shirt
back, we have to talk,

03:54.830 --> 03:56.208
and I'm not sure I'm ready for that,

03:56.232 --> 03:58.210
because he might say the thing
that he didn't want to say

03:58.234 --> 03:59.444
before when we fought,

03:59.468 --> 04:01.046
and I'm afraid I might not
want to hear it.

04:01.070 --> 04:02.180
Okay?

04:02.204 --> 04:03.582
And I might say something
that I don't mean to say,

04:03.606 --> 04:04.850
but I don't want to throw
the shirt out, either,

04:04.874 --> 04:05.984
because did I mention...

04:06.008 --> 04:07.519
did I mention how good it smells?

04:07.543 --> 04:11.423
You know, letting go
can be really hard sometimes.

04:11.447 --> 04:13.325
You know, a-and the longer
that you're in it,

04:13.349 --> 04:14.593
the deeper the commitment,

04:14.617 --> 04:16.695
and that... that can be even harder.

04:16.719 --> 04:19.363
You're saying I should...
I should toss the shirt.

04:19.387 --> 04:22.034
Or toss... Or toss Ripley?

04:22.058 --> 04:23.402
No, hang on. It was just one fight.

04:23.426 --> 04:24.703
Now you think we should break up.

04:24.727 --> 04:25.937
That's... That's not what I'm saying.

04:25.961 --> 04:29.002
Okay, you know what?
You talk in circles, Freckles.

04:29.441 --> 04:32.044
It's confusing for a woman with a fever.

04:33.502 --> 04:35.580
Hughes, go home before
you infect this entire place.

04:35.604 --> 04:37.516
- What?
- Captain's orders.

04:37.540 --> 04:41.119
Montgomery, sanitize.

04:46.449 --> 04:49.027
And they were cuddly,
he was in his bathrobe,

04:49.051 --> 04:51.630
there was chest hair, and a milk frother.

04:51.654 --> 04:52.764
- Nice!
- Go, Captain!

04:52.788 --> 04:53.965
I mean, if it makes him happy.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.867
No. No, no, no, no, no, not... not nice.

04:55.891 --> 04:57.002
Not sweet. Frothing.

04:57.026 --> 04:59.137
There was naked milk frothing!

04:59.161 --> 05:02.007
You actually walked in on them
frothing away?

05:02.031 --> 05:03.408
Well, it was after, but...

05:03.432 --> 05:05.877
I think it's great that he has
a sunset companion at his age.

05:05.901 --> 05:08.613
Did I mention she was wearing
his Station 19 crew shirt?

05:08.637 --> 05:10.215
Ooh, that's not cool.
Crew shirts are sacred.

05:10.239 --> 05:11.817
That changes everything.

05:11.841 --> 05:13.418
I should get my mom to set him up.

05:13.442 --> 05:15.387
None of her picks would
put on a firefighting shirt,

05:15.411 --> 05:18.323
because they're definitely
not into firefighting.

05:18.347 --> 05:19.391
How many you up to now?

05:19.415 --> 05:20.759
I'm three for three.

05:20.783 --> 05:22.327
I got another one tomorrow.

05:22.351 --> 05:23.929
And the sooner I get through her setups,

05:23.953 --> 05:25.530
the sooner I'll hold up
my end of the bargain,

05:25.554 --> 05:26.865
then she'll have to hold up hers.

05:26.889 --> 05:28.400
That'll happen.

05:28.424 --> 05:29.367
Yemi!

05:29.391 --> 05:30.635
Hey, Gibson!

05:30.659 --> 05:31.970
What is my little sister doing here?

05:31.994 --> 05:34.206
Oh, you know. Thought I'd just come by,

05:34.230 --> 05:36.174
see the place, laugh at you.

05:36.198 --> 05:37.609
Yeah.

05:37.633 --> 05:39.511
Definitely gonna do some of that.

05:44.373 --> 05:46.818
You know, typically, you don't
have to sand quite so, uh...

05:46.842 --> 05:48.206
forcefully.

05:52.081 --> 05:53.725
Keep that up, you might start a fire.

05:53.749 --> 05:56.094
- Some places are sacred, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

05:56.118 --> 05:58.563
- Like this... this is our station.
- Yeah.

05:58.587 --> 06:00.899
And a giant RV just
slammed right into it.

06:00.923 --> 06:03.034
Or like my house and my dad.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.432
Real Estate Reggie
just slammed into that!

06:06.695 --> 06:07.873
I walked in on him

06:07.897 --> 06:10.675
with his lady friend this morning, and...

06:10.699 --> 06:13.445
...I wasn't prepared
to start my day like that.

06:15.037 --> 06:16.448
You think this is funny?

06:16.472 --> 06:18.450
Well...

06:18.474 --> 06:20.051
Your reaction is funny.

06:21.377 --> 06:22.888
Stop laughing.

06:22.912 --> 06:23.974
Stop.

06:24.012 --> 06:25.243
I'm sorry. I'm trying.

06:25.267 --> 06:27.559
Just cut him some slack, all right?

06:27.583 --> 06:28.726
Your dad's living his life.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.499
She was wearing his crew shirt.

06:30.752 --> 06:32.296
_

06:32.321 --> 06:33.487
Hey, now.

06:39.128 --> 06:41.873
I forgot all about these.

06:41.897 --> 06:43.022
What?

06:43.046 --> 06:45.076
These... These pencil marks.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.946
When I used to visit
my dad here as a kid,

06:47.970 --> 06:49.915
he'd measure my height.

06:49.939 --> 06:52.150
He told me that I had to be this height

06:52.174 --> 06:54.653
before he would seriously
consider me to be a firefighter.

06:54.677 --> 06:56.488
"A" for "Andy," "R" for "Ryan."

06:56.512 --> 06:58.256
He would tag along sometimes.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.647
He always liked recording
how much taller he was than me.

07:01.884 --> 07:03.784
Well, you've grown up a lot since then.

07:05.354 --> 07:07.399
Except for when it comes to your dad.

07:07.423 --> 07:10.335
Or your truly terrible sanding.

07:10.359 --> 07:12.170
Oh!

07:14.029 --> 07:17.008
Oh, great! Warren, I was hoping
to find you. You got a minute?

07:17.032 --> 07:18.343
Uh, it's gonna have to be on the move.

07:18.367 --> 07:20.912
- I'm already running late.
- All right.

07:20.936 --> 07:22.280
I was talking to my friend
the other night...

07:22.304 --> 07:23.548
a coworker, actually.

07:23.572 --> 07:24.850
She just got EMT-certified

07:24.874 --> 07:26.518
and was saying how much
it's helped her on the job.

07:26.542 --> 07:28.286
Got me thinking, since you were a doctor,

07:28.310 --> 07:29.421
maybe you could help me...

07:29.445 --> 07:30.508
Sorry.

07:30.532 --> 07:31.723
As much as I would love to,

07:31.747 --> 07:33.892
I am on a really tight
schedule right now...

07:33.916 --> 07:35.026
prepping for Medic One,

07:35.050 --> 07:36.661
just took my physical during lunch,

07:36.685 --> 07:37.963
and, uh, now I'm late,

07:37.987 --> 07:40.360
and I really don't have time
for this conversation.

07:40.723 --> 07:41.791
Well...

07:41.815 --> 07:43.735
But, uh, I am sure that there are

07:43.759 --> 07:45.270
plenty of people around here

07:45.294 --> 07:47.339
who can lend a hand,
you know, like, uh...

07:47.363 --> 07:49.040
hey, like Andy.

07:49.064 --> 07:50.530
Just... Just ask her.

07:52.401 --> 07:54.902
Talk to Andy. Right.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:22.231 --> 08:24.109
Leave a message at the tone. Thanks.

08:24.133 --> 08:25.977
Montgomery, this is your fault.

08:26.001 --> 08:27.612
I'm blaming you.

08:27.636 --> 08:29.214
I ran into Ripley on my way out,

08:29.238 --> 08:30.515
and I sneezed in his face,

08:30.539 --> 08:32.150
and all I wanted to do
was yell "T-shirt."

08:32.174 --> 08:33.318
I-I don't know.

08:33.342 --> 08:34.419
If he and I can't even
talk to each other,

08:34.443 --> 08:35.419
then maybe you're right.

08:35.443 --> 08:37.756
Maybe we should break up.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.991
I-I cannot believe you are
not answering your phone

08:40.015 --> 08:42.327
when I need you
to talk me off my fever ledge.

08:42.351 --> 08:43.929
You're a jerk.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.193
I hate you.

08:59.568 --> 09:02.547
Ohh!

09:02.571 --> 09:04.416
You okay?

09:04.440 --> 09:06.084
No, I am not okay, Josh.

09:06.108 --> 09:07.585
How much further?

09:07.609 --> 09:09.688
We're 12 minutes from the hospital, tops.

09:09.712 --> 09:11.323
I'm using the GPS.
I'm taking the side roads.

09:12.748 --> 09:14.326
Oh, God. Oh, God.

09:14.350 --> 09:15.760
Aah! Aah!

09:18.787 --> 09:20.899
Aah! Aah!

09:40.560 --> 09:42.104
Hold on! I'll help you!

09:42.128 --> 09:43.539
Just hold on!

09:56.009 --> 09:58.220
Aw, damn it!

09:59.245 --> 10:00.856
Of course it's dead.

10:12.025 --> 10:13.836
Sir! Sir, don't move!

10:13.860 --> 10:15.738
You've been in an accident.
Is your shoulder hurt?

10:15.762 --> 10:17.406
Aah! I'm okay. You got to help my wife.

10:17.430 --> 10:19.394
A possible torn rotator or dislocation.

10:19.418 --> 10:21.210
Did you hit your head?
Can you tell me your name?

10:21.234 --> 10:22.678
Josh, but, please...

10:22.702 --> 10:24.413
Your pupils are dilated.

10:24.437 --> 10:25.514
Are you feeling dizzy, Josh?

10:25.538 --> 10:26.649
Can you tell me what year it is?

10:26.673 --> 10:28.283
Please! Emmanuelle is pregnant!

10:28.307 --> 10:29.818
She's pinned in there. She can't get out.

10:29.842 --> 10:31.687
Hi, Emmanuelle. You doing okay in here?

10:31.711 --> 10:34.045
Uh, yeah, I-I think so.
I'm, uh, I'm stuck.

10:35.908 --> 10:37.454
Damn it.

10:37.795 --> 10:39.154
Uh, how... how far along are you?

10:39.154 --> 10:40.832
My water broke. We were on
the way to the hospital.

10:40.856 --> 10:42.600
Oh, that's pretty far along.

10:42.624 --> 10:44.736
But I don't want you to worry, okay?

10:44.760 --> 10:47.005
I set some flares, and
my med kit's not the biggest,

10:47.029 --> 10:48.907
but I think I've got all
the essentials we'll need.

10:48.931 --> 10:50.108
Who are you?

10:50.132 --> 10:52.343
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I'm Vic. I'm a firefighter.

10:52.367 --> 10:53.378
Oh, thank God.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.813
Is anyone else coming?

10:54.837 --> 10:56.247
Well, I called 911, or I tried to

10:56.271 --> 10:58.783
before my phone, uh, died,

10:58.807 --> 11:00.718
but they can track even a partial call.

11:00.742 --> 11:02.887
They'll, uh... you know,
they'll ping the towers,

11:02.911 --> 11:04.489
and more help will be here any minute.

11:04.513 --> 11:05.824
What if the call didn't go through?

11:05.848 --> 11:08.560
Let's just focus on taking care
of you two right now, okay?

11:13.755 --> 11:15.166
What were Miller's parents like?

11:15.190 --> 11:18.325
'Cause his sister's basically
Carbon Copy Dean.

11:23.599 --> 11:24.876
You good?

11:24.900 --> 11:25.999
Yeah. Why?

11:27.369 --> 11:28.947
'Cause you're doing the quiet thing.

11:28.971 --> 11:30.437
What quiet thing?

11:32.241 --> 11:34.007
See? Quiet thing.

11:36.445 --> 11:40.024
Okay, is it me or us
that's making you quiet?

11:40.048 --> 11:41.359
We haven't really talked more

11:41.383 --> 11:42.994
since I hung up on you for a baby.

11:43.018 --> 11:44.184
Yeah, it's not that.

11:45.654 --> 11:47.120
It's not. I swear.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.969
It's just, seeing Dean
with his family lately

11:50.993 --> 11:52.270
has got me thinking about mine,

11:52.294 --> 11:56.407
wondering who they are and... and where.

11:56.431 --> 11:58.676
N-Never mind. It's nothing.

11:58.700 --> 12:00.278
I thought you said
your parents got married

12:00.302 --> 12:01.646
six months after they met.

12:01.670 --> 12:03.414
My last set of foster parents did.

12:03.438 --> 12:05.450
Bio parents are more of a black hole.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.485
You do know there's this crazy
thing called the Internet

12:07.509 --> 12:10.213
- where you can stalk basically anyo...
- Yeah, I don't wanna stalk.

12:10.879 --> 12:12.457
I'd rather just forget about it.

12:13.949 --> 12:15.560
Bishop, Sullivan wants us on maintenance.

12:15.584 --> 12:16.583
Cool?

12:18.520 --> 12:19.531
Not cool?

12:19.555 --> 12:21.766
All good. Let's go maintain.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.404
Sir, it was only five minutes later

12:26.428 --> 12:27.539
- than I said I'd be back.
- Hmm.

12:27.563 --> 12:29.374
My physical for the Medic One application

12:29.398 --> 12:31.142
ran late this afternoon. That's all.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.977
But it doesn't mean that
I'll be any less focused

12:33.001 --> 12:34.245
on my duties here at 19.

12:34.269 --> 12:36.047
I-I'm sticking to
a very tight schedule...

12:36.071 --> 12:39.050
home, Medic One studies, here.

12:39.074 --> 12:40.752
All right, I-I'm even doing
nightly video chats

12:40.776 --> 12:41.853
with Miranda and Tuck.

12:41.877 --> 12:43.621
I-I can juggle it all.

12:43.645 --> 12:45.023
Give or take five minutes?

12:47.276 --> 12:48.860
Sorry to interrupt.

12:48.884 --> 12:51.763
It's all right. Warren, dismissed.

12:52.088 --> 12:53.506
Sir.

12:55.257 --> 12:56.935
Quarterly stats and, uh,

12:56.959 --> 12:58.736
I need your rubber stamp
on some incident reports.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.205
Just set 'em over there.

13:11.173 --> 13:12.317
Something else I can help you with?

13:12.341 --> 13:13.718
Cheeseburgers.

13:13.742 --> 13:14.986
From the drive-in on Broadway.

13:15.010 --> 13:16.721
I remember you always liked that place.

13:16.745 --> 13:19.824
I, uh, got some fries
and some onion rings, too.

13:19.848 --> 13:21.726
I know you don't typically
eat with the crew,

13:21.750 --> 13:23.494
but I thought maybe...

13:23.518 --> 13:25.619
you've got time for a quick bite with me?

13:29.124 --> 13:30.768
Emmanuelle left her phone at home.

13:30.792 --> 13:32.804
Mine was on the center console,

13:32.828 --> 13:35.173
but I-I haven't seen it
since the accident.

13:36.665 --> 13:38.142
Yeah, I'm not seeing it, either.

13:38.166 --> 13:39.677
But like I said,
someone's gonna come for us.

13:39.701 --> 13:41.045
Meanwhile, keep yourself dry.

13:41.069 --> 13:42.246
But what if they take too long?

13:42.270 --> 13:43.448
She's wedged in there so tight.

13:43.472 --> 13:44.916
Oh, her injuries look superficial,

13:44.940 --> 13:47.352
and her heart rate and BP is
remarkably low, considering.

13:47.376 --> 13:48.453
Never mind me.

13:48.477 --> 13:49.954
Yes, mind you!

13:49.978 --> 13:51.089
Mind my wife, too, please?

13:51.113 --> 13:52.991
It's the baby I'm worried about.

13:53.015 --> 13:54.158
Blue's so little.

13:54.182 --> 13:56.527
Blueberry.
It's our nickname for the baby.

13:56.551 --> 13:57.629
Okay.

13:57.653 --> 13:59.464
We don't know if Blue's a boy or a girl.

13:59.488 --> 14:01.065
Please don't say there's anything
wrong with Blueberry, please.

14:01.089 --> 14:03.334
Today was supposed to be
Blueberry's birthday...

14:03.358 --> 14:05.837
It still is, Em. Right?

14:05.861 --> 14:08.339
Of course. Right.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.124
Hey, hey, hey!

14:27.238 --> 14:28.326
You try running one more time,

14:28.350 --> 14:29.827
and I will kick your ass to county jail.

14:29.851 --> 14:31.062
Are we clear?

14:34.356 --> 14:35.400
Oh, hi, Ryan.

14:35.424 --> 14:36.934
Busy day?

14:36.958 --> 14:38.603
Not not busy.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.527
Still free after shift, though.

14:41.530 --> 14:43.741
- Are you asking me out this time?
- Depends.

14:43.765 --> 14:45.109
You interested in a second date?

14:45.133 --> 14:46.611
Not not interested.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.046
Tanner!

14:48.413 --> 14:50.081
We have a situation.

14:50.105 --> 14:51.883
Did Andy call you?
What did she say? Was she upset?

14:51.907 --> 14:52.917
About?

14:52.941 --> 14:55.420
Andy walked in on me with Reggie.

14:55.444 --> 14:57.321
And we weren't exactly dressed yet.

14:57.345 --> 14:58.556
Oh, no.

14:58.580 --> 15:00.391
Now Reggie's trying to
convince me to go to Hawaii,

15:00.415 --> 15:01.559
as if I can just commit

15:01.583 --> 15:02.960
to a spur-of-the-moment trip
just like that.

15:02.984 --> 15:04.162
And Andy ran out of there so fast.

15:04.186 --> 15:05.663
She always goes to you when she's upset.

15:05.687 --> 15:08.099
Is she okay? Should I try
to talk to her? I...

15:08.123 --> 15:10.134
I... haven't heard from her.

15:10.158 --> 15:11.636
- Huh?
- At all, actually.

15:12.761 --> 15:14.939
Hawaii sounds fun. You should go for it.

15:14.963 --> 15:16.107
I'm sorry, but who are you?

15:16.131 --> 15:17.709
- Oh, hi. I'm Jenna.
- Jenna.

15:17.733 --> 15:18.743
I work with Tanner here.

15:18.767 --> 15:20.011
We cover the Shoreline beat together.

15:20.035 --> 15:22.246
And, uh, he doesn't know this,

15:22.270 --> 15:24.370
but I'm the best second date
he's ever gonna have.

15:25.340 --> 15:26.484
Tonight.

15:26.508 --> 15:29.053
After he accepts my invitation.

15:33.782 --> 15:35.059
Can I ask you a question?

15:35.083 --> 15:37.095
- Yes, my deodorant failed.
- Is it obvious?

15:37.119 --> 15:38.629
No. I mean, yes.

15:38.653 --> 15:39.997
This is more of a hypothetical.

15:40.021 --> 15:41.966
Isn't Andy the one you go to
with these kinds of questions?

15:41.990 --> 15:43.334
Stay with me, Montgomery.

15:43.358 --> 15:45.803
Say you have this friend
who is struggling with something

15:45.827 --> 15:48.406
and you can tell that
it's really upsetting him.

15:48.430 --> 15:51.409
You even have really great ideas
about ways to help,

15:51.433 --> 15:53.177
but they just seem
to not want to hear them.

15:53.201 --> 15:55.113
I mean, do you push? Should you push?

15:55.137 --> 15:58.082
Okay, so, you know how this bolt
that you're tightening

15:58.106 --> 15:59.150
has a breaking point?

15:59.174 --> 16:00.251
So do people.

16:00.275 --> 16:01.419
You know, if someone
doesn't want your help,

16:01.443 --> 16:02.553
you trying to force it on them

16:02.577 --> 16:04.088
is actually the opposite
of being helpful.

16:04.112 --> 16:05.389
It'll annoy them, and then they'll...

16:05.413 --> 16:08.192
leave you mean, feverish
voicemails on their drive home.

16:08.216 --> 16:09.594
I thought we were talking
about my friend.

16:09.618 --> 16:11.562
- Why are we talking about your friend?
- Stay with me, Bishop.

16:11.586 --> 16:12.930
- Okay, but I really just need to know...
- I know.

16:12.954 --> 16:15.767
I think the real question that
you need to ask yourself is,

16:15.791 --> 16:17.290
why do you care so much?

16:22.197 --> 16:24.175
Mom wants to know
why you wore your bad jeans

16:24.199 --> 16:25.743
on your date with Taylor.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.233
She said they made your legs
look too skinny.

16:28.336 --> 16:30.114
Not the jeans' fault, I guess.

16:30.138 --> 16:32.283
How do you know that,
and how does Mom know that?

16:32.307 --> 16:33.751
Every girl she sets you up with

16:33.775 --> 16:35.620
has a mom who's friends with Mom.

16:35.644 --> 16:36.765
They talk.

16:36.795 --> 16:38.356
Everyone knows everyone's business.

16:38.380 --> 16:40.091
The deal was that Mom sets up the dates

16:40.115 --> 16:41.945
and I go out on them, and I'm doing that.

16:41.969 --> 16:44.695
Yeah, and as much as I am
really enjoying the show

16:44.719 --> 16:47.098
knowing how much you hate it, truly

16:47.122 --> 16:49.300
I don't need Mom and Dad's help that bad.

16:49.324 --> 16:51.669
They're treating you differently
than they treated me,

16:51.693 --> 16:54.038
a-and that's... it's not fair.

16:54.062 --> 16:56.172
Yeah, you're just now realizing that?

16:56.196 --> 16:57.708
They've always treated you differently.

16:57.732 --> 17:00.011
You're the oldest. You're their son.

17:00.035 --> 17:01.913
I'm just the kid sister
they still treat like a baby.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.214
Don't let them do that.

17:03.238 --> 17:05.215
Well, I could just crash at your place.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.884
Jack is super fun to look at.

17:06.907 --> 17:09.587
Uh, no. No. That will never happen.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.923
Mom's never gonna be happy
if you're just phoning it in.

17:11.946 --> 17:13.643
And neither are your dates.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.693
You know, we women, we're not dumb.

17:15.717 --> 17:17.891
We know when someone's just
going through the motions.

17:17.915 --> 17:19.021
Mm.

17:19.487 --> 17:21.521
For real, though, is Jack single?

17:24.559 --> 17:27.571
Okay, okay, you're doing great.

17:27.596 --> 17:29.974
It's just a contraction.
It's totally normal.

17:39.341 --> 17:40.418
Aah!

17:40.442 --> 17:42.553
Josh?! You okay out there?

17:42.577 --> 17:44.188
Gah! I'm good!

17:44.212 --> 17:45.556
Your contractions are coming sooner,

17:45.580 --> 17:46.691
but we've still got plenty of time.

17:46.715 --> 17:48.292
I just need to try and make sure you stay

17:48.316 --> 17:50.361
as warm and dry as possible.

17:50.385 --> 17:51.729
Don't want you getting hypothermia.

17:51.753 --> 17:53.164
Josh!

17:53.188 --> 17:55.032
I, uh... I got a blanket
in the back of my car.

17:55.056 --> 17:57.257
Do you think you might
be able to grab it for me?

17:59.761 --> 18:01.172
Josh?

18:01.197 --> 18:02.674
Josh?

18:17.531 --> 18:19.764
You did hit your head, didn't you, Josh?

18:21.201 --> 18:23.368
Uh...

18:25.539 --> 18:27.016
Possible grade 3 concussion.

18:30.652 --> 18:31.687
Ah! What's happening?

18:31.711 --> 18:32.722
Hey. Emmanuelle?!

18:32.746 --> 18:33.890
No, easy, easy, easy.

18:33.914 --> 18:35.458
She's fine, but you
passed out on me, Josh.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.493
You held out on me, too. You
got a nasty cut on your scalp.

18:37.517 --> 18:38.795
You got any neck pain?

18:38.819 --> 18:40.163
No, I feel fine.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.364
Is he hurt?

18:41.388 --> 18:42.965
No, he's all right.

18:42.989 --> 18:45.201
And this time, he's gonna do
exactly what I tell him to do,

18:45.225 --> 18:46.232
- right, Josh?
- Yeah.

18:46.256 --> 18:47.703
- Okay, good.
- Okay.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.347
So, you're gonna sit up
with me real slow, okay?

18:50.371 --> 18:52.675
- Okay. Okay.
- All right. All right.

18:52.699 --> 18:53.676
All right, I'm okay.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.645
I want you to stay that way.

18:55.669 --> 18:57.780
Okay, you're gonna sit right
down next to me and Emmanuelle

18:57.804 --> 18:59.348
so I can keep an eye on
both of you at the same time.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.876
- Okay. Okay.
- All right?

19:00.900 --> 19:02.351
I'm the one stuck in here
having contractions,

19:02.375 --> 19:04.053
but all I want to do is take care of you.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.490
No, I'm... fine.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.991
I'm fine.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.293
Yeah.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.228
Hey, hey, eyes open!
You need to stay awake.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.262
Okay. Okay?

19:13.286 --> 19:16.065
Uh, uh, how did you guys meet, huh?

19:17.591 --> 19:20.169
- It was raining, actually.
- Okay.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.893
Kinda like today.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.777
Do you need something?

19:27.801 --> 19:28.978
Do you?

19:29.002 --> 19:30.346
I talked to Maya.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.081
She didn't give me
a lot of details or anything,

19:32.105 --> 19:35.151
but I just wanted you to know
that you are strong,

19:35.175 --> 19:36.619
and you will get through this.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.854
Thank you.

19:37.878 --> 19:40.489
That... Actually,
that really means a lot.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.624
If I can help in any way,

19:41.648 --> 19:42.925
you have my full and complete support.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.460
Well, I'm sure I'll get over it.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.229
I know I'm probably overreacting.

19:46.253 --> 19:50.099
She just didn't have
any pants on, you know?

19:50.123 --> 19:51.300
And neither did my dad,

19:51.324 --> 19:54.003
and once that visual
is burned into your brain,

19:54.027 --> 19:56.828
that's hard to unsee, you know?

19:58.798 --> 20:00.064
Yes.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.778
Yes, it is.

20:08.942 --> 20:11.821
Ah, when I say I went on
a lot of dates, I mean,

20:11.845 --> 20:14.123
I swiped right so much,
I forgot left even existed.

20:14.147 --> 20:16.125
How did this nice story about
the day we met turn into

20:16.149 --> 20:17.760
a list of all the women
who came before me?

20:17.784 --> 20:19.262
'Cause none of them were right.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.131
And they all led me to you.

20:23.905 --> 20:25.049
Okay, fine.

20:25.073 --> 20:27.169
You're right. It is a nice story.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.638
Nothing ever seemed to work out,

20:28.662 --> 20:30.740
so I finally just gave up.

20:30.764 --> 20:31.941
You gave up?

20:31.965 --> 20:33.507
Yeah.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.812
A week later, Emmanuelle
walked into my life.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.281
Well, actually, he bumped into me

20:38.305 --> 20:39.715
in the flower stall
in the Pike Place Market.

20:39.739 --> 20:40.783
She was so beautiful.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.419
I was soaked,
wearing sweats and no makeup.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.289
So by the time of our fifth date, I knew.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.090
Fifth date? That's pretty specific.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.126
Don't most people say
they know on the first date?

20:50.150 --> 20:52.128
No. It was our fifth.

20:52.152 --> 20:53.729
It was our first fight.

20:53.753 --> 20:57.066
It was big and loud and in public.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.702
Ooh, I'm having another one.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.103
Okay, uh, Emmanuelle, is it okay

21:01.127 --> 21:02.438
if I take a closer look this time?

21:02.462 --> 21:04.473
Yeah. I guess so.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.542
It's all right, baby.
It's gonna be all right.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.210
- It's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

21:12.973 --> 21:13.983
What is it?

21:14.007 --> 21:15.318
Uh...

21:15.342 --> 21:17.225
you are starting to crown.

21:17.249 --> 21:18.354
Oh, no.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.656
So, uh, I'm just gonna get
a few things ready,

21:20.680 --> 21:22.258
and, uh... just in case.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.393
And in the meantime,
I need you to do me a big favor.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.394
What's that?

21:25.809 --> 21:27.051
Don't push.

21:30.223 --> 21:33.302
Hey. I was thinking we could
call that social worker

21:33.326 --> 21:34.804
who took our Safe Surrender last shift.

21:34.828 --> 21:36.339
I bet she'd have the resources
that could help with...

21:36.363 --> 21:37.773
Why... Why are you still on this?

21:37.797 --> 21:40.376
I-I... I don't know.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.844
It seemed important to you, so...

21:41.868 --> 21:43.101
So... So, what?

21:44.270 --> 21:47.249
This isn't as easy as
ripping off a Band-Aid, Maya.

21:47.273 --> 21:49.518
You know, it's complicated.
It's personal.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.220
And it's not a door
I can close once it's open,

21:51.244 --> 21:53.745
and, honestly, you're making me
regret having even told you.

21:55.682 --> 21:56.926
I was just trying to help.

21:56.950 --> 21:58.961
Okay, then forget I mentioned anything,

21:58.985 --> 22:00.918
and let me do my job, okay?

22:03.490 --> 22:04.822
Yeah.

22:06.626 --> 22:09.805
Yeah, um, I appreciate this, but...

22:09.829 --> 22:11.374
I know, I know.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.398
You and I haven't, uh...

22:14.701 --> 22:16.846
We don't really do this together anymore.

22:16.870 --> 22:17.913
No, we don't.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.951
You know, it's funny.

22:21.975 --> 22:24.253
Once you're Chief,

22:24.277 --> 22:26.555
you don't have many peers,

22:26.579 --> 22:29.992
even fewer real friends, but I keep...

22:30.016 --> 22:32.061
I keep wishing lately that
I could talk to someone

22:32.085 --> 22:34.652
who really knows me and...

22:37.891 --> 22:39.799
You know, I never got to tell you

22:40.493 --> 22:42.138
how sorry I was.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.830
I-I never got the chance...

22:51.404 --> 22:53.082
You know what? Never mind. This...

22:53.106 --> 22:54.183
This was a bad idea.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.619
I'm sorry to have
wasted your time, Sully.

22:56.643 --> 22:57.942
What's her name?

23:01.214 --> 23:03.025
You still got all the same tells.

23:03.615 --> 23:05.961
So go ahead. I'm listening.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.332
Okay. Okay...

23:11.825 --> 23:13.702
Wow. This is harder than I thought.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.705
Um, basically, I screwed up,

23:16.729 --> 23:19.175
and I-I know I screwed up.

23:19.199 --> 23:20.731
How big a screw-up?

23:22.469 --> 23:24.836
Is it someone in the department?

23:28.141 --> 23:30.886
Here.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.455
Something's going around.

23:32.479 --> 23:34.590
I had to send Hughes home earlier,

23:34.614 --> 23:35.703
and...

23:39.519 --> 23:41.430
It's Hughes.

23:42.856 --> 23:45.501
Man, it just... it just happened.

23:45.525 --> 23:47.636
I mean, it took me
completely by surprise,

23:47.660 --> 23:49.004
her, too, I think, and, Sully,

23:49.028 --> 23:51.006
it's... it's so good and new.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.975
Except that when it's
this new and you have a fight,

23:52.999 --> 23:55.544
it can be so bad, especially
given the obvious circumstances,

23:55.568 --> 23:56.745
and I just... I really...

23:56.769 --> 23:58.614
I don't know what...

23:58.638 --> 24:00.338
I don't know what to do here.

24:02.709 --> 24:04.426
Shouldn't have said anything.

24:05.178 --> 24:06.489
If this is real for you,

24:06.513 --> 24:08.722
don't waste your time talking to me.

24:09.282 --> 24:11.482
Find her and tell her
exactly how you feel.

24:12.819 --> 24:13.863
Thank you.

24:13.887 --> 24:17.032
But for the record, this
conversation never happened.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.568
And if it comes down to it,
I will protect her,

24:19.592 --> 24:21.437
not you, understand?

24:22.509 --> 24:24.773
Civilian in distress
for Ladder, Engine, Aid 19.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.676
Partial 911 received,

24:27.700 --> 24:29.411
mile marker 22 off of Interstate 5.

24:29.435 --> 24:30.679
And that's lunch.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.915
Unknown number of victims. Sully.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.283
I know that number.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.118
It's Vic.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.320
Listen, everybody,
Hughes is in the field,

24:38.344 --> 24:39.455
and she is in need of assistance.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.857
That means we move double time!

24:41.881 --> 24:44.493
You know your assignments. Let's move!

24:46.753 --> 24:48.819
- Chief?
- Let's go.

24:59.566 --> 25:01.477
Hey. Hey, somebody's coming!

25:01.501 --> 25:03.000
Is... Is that your backup?

25:05.638 --> 25:06.949
Hey! Stop!

25:06.973 --> 25:08.639
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

25:10.210 --> 25:12.288
They didn't even slow down!

25:14.507 --> 25:15.747
- What?

25:16.249 --> 25:18.394
Oh, God!

25:18.418 --> 25:20.529
Hey, don't push. Don't push.

25:20.553 --> 25:21.664
How are you gonna do this?

25:21.688 --> 25:23.098
Don't worry. I've done this before.

25:23.122 --> 25:24.533
Oh, really? You've delivered a baby

25:24.557 --> 25:25.901
on the side of the road in the rain

25:25.925 --> 25:27.603
with the mom-to-be trapped
inside a car wreck?

25:27.627 --> 25:29.638
Every birth is special.

25:31.497 --> 25:33.108
Oh, God. I have to push.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.677
I can't stop it. It's coming.

25:34.701 --> 25:35.816
I have to push. All right. All right.

25:35.841 --> 25:36.845
Okay, you got this.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.447
You got this.

25:38.471 --> 25:39.854
You got this.

25:43.287 --> 25:45.350
Look at the bright side.
At least the rain has stopped.

25:47.125 --> 25:48.428
Oh, I can't do this.

25:48.428 --> 25:50.106
I can't. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25:50.130 --> 25:52.008
- I can't.
- Shh, no, no, no. It's okay.

25:52.032 --> 25:53.009
It's gonna be okay.

25:53.033 --> 25:54.176
We got to get you out of here.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.344
We got to find a way.

25:55.368 --> 25:58.180
It's not working.

25:58.204 --> 26:00.271
That's okay. We'll figure
something else out.

26:06.279 --> 26:07.423
You're awfully quiet over there, Josh.

26:07.447 --> 26:08.457
How you doing?

26:08.481 --> 26:09.592
I'm fine.

26:09.616 --> 26:10.660
You're lying.

26:10.684 --> 26:11.827
I can always tell when he's lying.

26:11.851 --> 26:14.330
No, I'm fine, Em. I just...
I can't use my hurt arm,

26:14.354 --> 26:16.932
but it doesn't matter right now.

26:16.956 --> 26:18.100
What else can I do? How can I help?

26:18.124 --> 26:19.735
The car has her pinned.

26:19.759 --> 26:21.904
The seat's broken,
but maybe I can find a way

26:21.928 --> 26:23.239
to force it back to give us more room.

26:23.263 --> 26:24.507
Room?

26:24.531 --> 26:25.841
To what, have the baby?

26:25.865 --> 26:27.777
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Where's the help you called?

26:27.801 --> 26:29.679
No, I want to deliver Blueberry
in a hospital.

26:29.703 --> 26:32.848
Just hold on tight to the
armrest, okay? Hold on tight.

26:32.872 --> 26:34.358
Do you want me to come in there,
too, to help with the seat?

26:34.383 --> 26:35.785
Not... Not with that... arm.

26:38.578 --> 26:40.723
We bought this minivan
to carry our baby in,

26:40.747 --> 26:42.224
not have our baby in.

26:42.248 --> 26:44.460
Josh, I need you to help keep
Emmanuelle focused, okay?

26:44.484 --> 26:46.295
You guys learned breathing
techniques, right?

26:46.319 --> 26:47.730
Can you just, uh, help her
focus on breathing?

26:47.754 --> 26:48.864
This can't be happening.

26:48.888 --> 26:50.199
No, this can't be happening.
Not like this.

26:50.223 --> 26:52.335
It's okay, Em. Let's just
breathe. We'll breathe.

26:52.359 --> 26:53.502
But what if something's gone wrong?

26:53.526 --> 26:54.537
What if Blueberry's hurt?

26:54.561 --> 26:55.871
There are no obvious signs of trauma.

26:55.895 --> 26:57.506
Our car is a pancake!

26:57.530 --> 27:00.242
It rolled, more than once,
across an entire street!

27:00.266 --> 27:01.811
There was trauma!

27:01.835 --> 27:04.413
What if Blueberry's not okay?
What if our baby's hurt?

27:04.437 --> 27:05.915
You've got this, Emmanuelle.

27:05.939 --> 27:08.451
No, I can't do this.
No, I'm scared. I can't push.

27:08.475 --> 27:10.720
- I'm too scared. I can't do this.
- No, you can. You can. You can.

27:10.744 --> 27:12.030
No, I can't!

27:12.645 --> 27:14.390
Uh, you guys got a fridge
in your kitchen?

27:15.715 --> 27:17.493
Yeah. Why?

27:17.517 --> 27:18.494
Okay, now, I want you both

27:18.518 --> 27:20.262
to imagine opening that fridge, got it?

27:20.286 --> 27:22.365
It's important. I promise.

27:22.389 --> 27:23.466
Okay.

27:23.490 --> 27:25.768
All right, now, see the carton of eggs?

27:25.792 --> 27:27.670
I want you each to take out an egg

27:27.694 --> 27:29.405
and imagine holding it in your hand.

27:29.429 --> 27:30.706
Okay, it's smooth, right?

27:30.730 --> 27:31.874
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

27:31.898 --> 27:33.075
Okay, now imagine shaking that egg

27:33.099 --> 27:34.643
as hard as you possibly can,

27:34.667 --> 27:36.045
and now imagine cracking it open.

27:36.069 --> 27:37.747
I don't understand.
Why... Why are we doing this?

27:37.771 --> 27:40.082
Because no matter how hard
you shake it, that egg,

27:40.106 --> 27:41.751
when you crack it open,
how does the yolk look?

27:41.775 --> 27:44.153
Like... a yolk?

27:44.177 --> 27:45.388
Exactly, yeah.

27:45.412 --> 27:47.056
It's yellow. It's round. It's intact.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.524
It's totally fine, okay?

27:48.548 --> 27:50.326
And that baby is strong as an egg yolk

27:50.350 --> 27:51.475
and very well protected,

27:51.499 --> 27:52.762
so even though your car was rolled

27:52.786 --> 27:54.296
and you were bouncing all around,

27:54.320 --> 27:55.498
Blueberry was floating, okay?

27:55.522 --> 27:56.832
And so I don't want you
to worry about Blue.

27:56.856 --> 27:58.234
I don't want you to worry about anything.

27:58.258 --> 28:01.404
Just... Just breathe, okay?

28:01.428 --> 28:03.139
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:03.163 --> 28:05.374
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:05.398 --> 28:07.198
All right.
You're doing great. Here we go.

28:18.111 --> 28:19.455
How much further?

28:19.479 --> 28:21.090
Uh, we're almost there.

28:22.749 --> 28:25.060
Vic wasn't feeling good,
and I told her to go home.

28:25.084 --> 28:27.885
She could've slept it off
in the bunk room, but...

28:30.390 --> 28:32.234
But I'm sure...

28:32.258 --> 28:34.503
I mean, you know, she's fine.

28:34.527 --> 28:36.672
If anybody can handle herself, it's Vic.

28:39.699 --> 28:40.876
Okay.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.144
I'm here, baby.

28:42.168 --> 28:45.181
Okay, we're gonna breathe
just like in birth class, okay?

28:45.205 --> 28:47.149
Remember? So, it's in through the nose...

28:47.173 --> 28:48.584
...out through the mouth.

28:48.608 --> 28:49.718
That's good. That's really good.

28:49.742 --> 28:51.420
Okay, now, when
the next contraction hits,

28:51.444 --> 28:52.822
it's gonna be time to push again, okay?

28:52.846 --> 28:53.956
Okay.

28:53.980 --> 28:55.958
You're awesome, Em. Just keep breathing.

28:55.982 --> 28:57.202
Just keep breathing, okay?

28:58.042 --> 28:59.361
I can't.

28:59.385 --> 29:00.663
Something smells really bad.

29:02.655 --> 29:04.099
That's gasoline.

29:04.123 --> 29:05.734
Josh, I can't move right now.
Can you take a look?

29:05.758 --> 29:07.803
Okay, okay.

29:07.827 --> 29:09.271
What's going on? What do you see?

29:09.295 --> 29:11.040
Uh, uh...

29:11.064 --> 29:12.842
Oh, there's gas.

29:12.866 --> 29:14.710
Um, it's leaking pretty fast.

29:14.734 --> 29:16.078
Leaking where, Josh?

29:16.102 --> 29:18.247
Well, it's... I mean, it's, uh...

29:18.271 --> 29:19.482
it's sort of going across the road

29:19.506 --> 29:20.649
kinda towards the... Oh, God.

29:20.673 --> 29:23.285
- Oh, no, no, fire!
- Oh, no, no, no, no...

29:23.309 --> 29:24.887
Josh, there's an extinguisher
near the back bumper.

29:24.911 --> 29:25.955
I need you to pull the pin on it

29:25.979 --> 29:27.323
and start spraying down the flames.

29:27.347 --> 29:28.858
- What?!
- Yeah, go, go!

29:28.882 --> 29:30.893
Okay. Oh, God. Okay, okay.

29:40.527 --> 29:41.871
Okay, it's time, Emmanuelle.

29:41.895 --> 29:44.406
I need you to push now. You can do this.

29:44.430 --> 29:46.108
Josh, it's the only extinguisher
we've got!

29:46.132 --> 29:47.543
Be careful not to use too much.

29:47.567 --> 29:50.079
Okay, keep pushing, Emmanuelle. Push!

29:50.103 --> 29:52.481
Okay. I can see... All right,
I can see the head!

29:52.505 --> 29:54.049
I can see the head, Emmanuelle!
Keep pushing!

29:54.073 --> 29:56.307
Keep pushing! Good, good, good! Good!

30:00.513 --> 30:01.724
It's running out!

30:01.748 --> 30:03.292
Push, push, push!

30:03.316 --> 30:04.627
Good! Good!

30:08.187 --> 30:09.253
Okay.

30:13.293 --> 30:14.370
It's a girl.

30:14.394 --> 30:16.438
It's a girl.

30:23.903 --> 30:25.536
It's out!

30:26.773 --> 30:28.717
Take the baby. Take her. Just save her.

30:28.741 --> 30:30.252
Just leave me here.

30:30.276 --> 30:32.121
No, Josh, Josh, get away from the car!

30:32.145 --> 30:35.391
- No, I am not leaving without them!
- Josh, get away from the car!

30:46.559 --> 30:47.970
Okay.

30:49.796 --> 30:51.674
This way!

30:51.698 --> 30:53.042
Hughes!

30:56.536 --> 30:57.846
Took you long enough!

30:57.870 --> 31:01.350
We've got two, uh...
three victims over here.

31:01.374 --> 31:02.885
Wife is pinned inside the car,

31:02.909 --> 31:04.987
husband's concussed with
head and shoulder wounds.

31:05.011 --> 31:07.545
Somebody get me a warmer for
a newborn baby right now!

31:26.324 --> 31:28.502
All right, anterior instability
with deep contusion

31:28.526 --> 31:30.237
with possible damage
to the axillary artery.

31:30.261 --> 31:32.773
Tell me you did not try to
set this shoulder back yourself.

31:32.797 --> 31:34.408
Look, we need to numb this up

31:34.432 --> 31:36.911
- and reset it back at the hospital.
- No, No, no. Hold on.

31:36.935 --> 31:39.113
Please, all I want to do
is see my wife and kid.

31:39.137 --> 31:40.147
Are they okay?

31:40.171 --> 31:41.782
They're in good hands.

31:41.806 --> 31:43.551
This ought to help with the pain.

31:43.575 --> 31:45.119
Can't you just reset it now?

31:45.143 --> 31:47.254
Trust me, you do not want me to
reset this before we get you...

31:47.278 --> 31:49.558
My wife just gave birth in a car fire.

31:50.415 --> 31:52.315
Fix my shoulder now, please.

31:54.953 --> 31:56.363
Try to keep it limp. Okay.

31:56.387 --> 31:58.098
I'm gonna move real slow.

32:03.895 --> 32:05.439
Okay, now, there we go.
Now, I'm gonna wrap this,

32:05.463 --> 32:06.941
and we're gonna get you back
to the hospital, all right?

32:06.965 --> 32:08.309
W-Wait, hey, hey, w-where are you going?

32:08.333 --> 32:09.477
Where are you going?

32:09.501 --> 32:11.445
Look, I know you're just doing your job,

32:11.469 --> 32:14.103
but all I want to do
is see my wife and kid.

32:18.175 --> 32:19.607
Thank you.

32:20.078 --> 32:21.489
Em? Em? You okay?

32:21.513 --> 32:23.858
- Yeah.
- She's doing great. So is Blueberry.

32:23.882 --> 32:25.860
I love you, sweetie.

32:25.884 --> 32:28.195
I'm so glad you're okay
and the baby's okay.

32:28.219 --> 32:30.064
We made it.

32:30.088 --> 32:32.233
- I love you.
- I love you, babe.

32:32.257 --> 32:34.268
And I am so mad at you.

32:34.770 --> 32:37.338
You ignored your symptoms
when you had a head wound?

32:37.362 --> 32:38.973
You don't get to sacrifice yourself.

32:38.997 --> 32:40.908
Not for me, not for Blue.

32:40.932 --> 32:43.277
You've got to take care of you,
for both of us.

32:43.301 --> 32:45.312
We both need you now.

32:45.336 --> 32:47.748
I know. I know.

32:48.158 --> 32:50.117
I'm still mad at you.

32:56.414 --> 32:57.725
Hey. Hey.

32:57.749 --> 32:59.393
Hi.

33:01.519 --> 33:04.365
So, you and Andy, you go back a ways.

33:04.389 --> 33:06.734
Oh, yeah, I mean, you know...

33:06.758 --> 33:09.303
Listen, if your hesitation about
tonight is because of her...

33:09.327 --> 33:10.738
Who says I'm hesitating?

33:10.762 --> 33:12.273
Her dad's visiting you at work.

33:12.297 --> 33:13.741
She "runs to you" when she's upset.

33:13.765 --> 33:15.175
I mean, it's clear
she's important in your life,

33:15.199 --> 33:17.811
but if she is still a thing for you,

33:17.835 --> 33:20.770
my invitation for tonight
only stands if she isn't.

33:27.078 --> 33:29.156
I think we're gonna reopen
the roads and be on our way.

33:29.180 --> 33:30.491
Sounds good.

33:30.515 --> 33:34.228
Uh, Warren mentioned you're
looking into EMT training?

33:34.252 --> 33:36.030
Thinking about it. Jenna's certified.

33:36.054 --> 33:38.232
She mentioned how it's helped
her out a bunch, so...

33:38.256 --> 33:40.200
Haven't I told you
you should get certified

33:40.224 --> 33:41.769
about a thousand times?

33:41.793 --> 33:43.470
Yeah, I know.

33:43.494 --> 33:45.227
Guess I just wasn't
that interested before.

33:48.499 --> 33:49.877
So, she's a cop.

33:49.901 --> 33:52.513
Seems like work's the only place
to meet someone sometimes.

33:52.537 --> 33:54.070
Mm.

33:55.006 --> 33:56.517
Look, I know we agreed

33:56.541 --> 33:58.018
it's not a big deal
if we see other people,

33:58.042 --> 34:00.554
but, um, so you and I
are on the same page,

34:00.578 --> 34:01.822
I have a second date with Jenna,

34:01.846 --> 34:03.457
and I think it's unfair to her
if you and I are...

34:03.481 --> 34:05.159
Sure, yeah.

34:05.183 --> 34:06.293
Understood.

34:06.317 --> 34:07.995
Okay.

34:08.018 --> 34:09.330
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

34:09.353 --> 34:11.732
Yeah. Good luck.

34:11.755 --> 34:13.000
Yeah.

34:13.024 --> 34:14.190
Herrera.

34:15.525 --> 34:17.304
All done here?

34:18.027 --> 34:19.958
Yes, I am.

34:21.498 --> 34:23.744
- Your temp's pretty high.
- I feel great.

34:23.768 --> 34:25.879
I saved people, and I delivered
a baby like a baller.

34:25.902 --> 34:27.147
That's the adrenaline talking.

34:27.170 --> 34:28.282
I'm awesome.

34:28.306 --> 34:30.016
You are.

34:30.041 --> 34:31.452
I'm still mad at you. Yeah, I know.

34:31.476 --> 34:33.621
Hey, I can... Hey, I can treat myself.

34:33.645 --> 34:34.888
- I don't need you.
- Noted.

34:34.911 --> 34:35.889
I don't.

34:35.913 --> 34:38.047
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:40.618 --> 34:44.553
Ooh, starting... I'm starting
to feel that fever now.

35:17.783 --> 35:20.250
You're not still thinking
about your dad's, uh,

35:20.251 --> 35:22.063
morning delight, are you?

35:23.622 --> 35:25.199
- I'm happy for him.
- Okay.

35:25.223 --> 35:27.318
I want him to move forward.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.637
I don't know why it's bugging me so much.

35:31.262 --> 35:33.630
It stirred up dust, hm?

35:35.066 --> 35:37.011
I don't want to get in his way.

35:37.035 --> 35:38.679
I think it's just...

35:38.703 --> 35:40.603
weird to see him moving on.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.419
The only other woman
I've ever seen my dad with

35:45.443 --> 35:47.755
in that house was...

35:48.179 --> 35:49.590
my mom.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.179
It's hard...

35:56.087 --> 35:58.015
to let go of your past sometimes.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.002
Why do you think I moved
all the way to Montana

36:01.026 --> 36:02.525
after my wife died?

36:03.962 --> 36:07.066
Funny thing is, I had to
come all the way back to Seattle

36:08.333 --> 36:10.778
before I could really start letting go.

36:11.278 --> 36:12.480
Have you?

36:12.504 --> 36:14.148
Let go of the past?

36:15.115 --> 36:16.817
Getting there.

36:28.553 --> 36:31.132
No, I will not make you
a peanut butter sandwich,

36:31.156 --> 36:33.534
and more importantly,
what are you still doing here?

36:33.558 --> 36:34.835
Hey, I may never leave.

36:34.859 --> 36:37.705
This place is way better than
hanging out at Mom and Dad's.

36:37.729 --> 36:40.207
Amazing pantry, great lounge.

36:40.231 --> 36:42.309
This is a workplace, my workplace,

36:42.333 --> 36:43.811
and you can't camp out here.

36:43.835 --> 36:46.480
Well, then you better stop phoning
in dates, or you're stuck with me.

36:46.504 --> 36:49.417
I have no interest in a woman
that wants what Mom wants,

36:49.441 --> 36:51.686
which is for me to stop
being a firefighter.

36:51.710 --> 36:52.820
If you put some real effort

36:52.844 --> 36:54.755
into showing them
how great this place is,

36:54.779 --> 36:56.424
one of them will actually listen.

36:56.448 --> 36:59.927
And you'll both live happily
ever after in the firehouse,

36:59.951 --> 37:01.784
making little fire babies.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.344
That was a nice family.

37:17.368 --> 37:19.469
Cute kid, too.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.540
See, now you're doing a "quiet" thing.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.322
Okay, I shut you down before,

37:28.346 --> 37:29.523
and maybe I was a little unfair.

37:29.547 --> 37:30.880
Yeah, you were.

37:32.383 --> 37:34.628
I know I can be pretty relentless,

37:34.652 --> 37:36.997
and sometimes it can be
a little bit too much.

37:37.021 --> 37:38.065
Way bit too much.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.400
And if you were just some friend

37:39.424 --> 37:40.634
that didn't want to take my advice,

37:40.658 --> 37:41.836
that would be one thing, but...

37:41.860 --> 37:43.926
- So I'm not just a friend?
- No.

37:45.777 --> 37:48.010
I don't know. Just forget it.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.178
You're sorry you told me
something personal.

37:51.202 --> 37:52.747
I'm sorry I bothered to care.

37:52.771 --> 37:53.881
I never asked you to care.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.436
You don't think I know that?

37:55.460 --> 37:58.119
I don't know. I literally have no idea
how to read anything you do.

37:58.143 --> 37:59.742
It's not that complicated.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.823
I just don't get why you'd even try to...

38:02.847 --> 38:05.426
Because... Because maybe I do care,

38:05.450 --> 38:06.761
and it's really annoying,

38:06.785 --> 38:08.028
because you are the last person

38:08.052 --> 38:10.286
that I ever wanted to start caring about.

38:11.422 --> 38:13.356
Wow, okay, uh...

38:14.692 --> 38:16.570
Not gonna lie, that stings.

38:16.594 --> 38:18.461
What now?

38:19.731 --> 38:21.275
You wanna kiss about it?

38:22.117 --> 38:24.445
God, no.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.283
Just let me know if there's
anything else you need, okay?

39:03.043 --> 39:05.419
Actually, there... there is.

39:05.443 --> 39:08.622
Uh, we had our first fight,

39:08.646 --> 39:10.858
but we didn't finish it.

39:10.882 --> 39:12.593
Well, we don't have to
finish it now, Vic.

39:12.617 --> 39:15.362
You're wrong, because if
an argument's all it takes

39:15.386 --> 39:17.464
- to tear us apart...
- You're sick. You're sick.

39:17.488 --> 39:20.067
- You should just rest.
- But I have your shirt!

39:20.091 --> 39:21.068
My shirt?

39:21.092 --> 39:23.737
You left your s-stupid shirt here, okay?

39:23.761 --> 39:25.039
And I don't want to give it back,

39:25.063 --> 39:26.273
but I swear to God I will

39:26.297 --> 39:28.531
if we can't straighten a few things out.

39:29.934 --> 39:31.612
Get what things straight?

39:31.636 --> 39:34.114
I am sick of the secrets.

39:34.138 --> 39:36.650
And I'm tired of hiding, but we have to.

39:36.674 --> 39:39.053
Unless we don't. I don't... I don't know.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.888
But if we can't even fight and make up,

39:40.912 --> 39:42.756
then there's no point
in you being nice to me

39:42.780 --> 39:44.825
or bringing me tea,
because we won't survive,

39:44.849 --> 39:46.827
in which case you can just
take your nice-smelling shirt

39:46.851 --> 39:48.251
and go.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.232
I don't want my shirt back.

39:51.832 --> 39:55.135
And mad or sick or tired
or any other way you feel,

39:55.159 --> 39:56.837
I don't want to go.

39:58.663 --> 39:59.840
I don't want to let you go.

40:11.476 --> 40:14.062
What if you get sick?
I could be contagious.

40:14.946 --> 40:17.091
Oh, you are.

40:17.115 --> 40:18.893
Once you really commit to something,

40:18.917 --> 40:20.728
there's no turning back.

40:25.189 --> 40:28.269
You got to own your part,
show your cards, be honest.

40:28.293 --> 40:30.571
Hey, Dad. Sorry I missed you.

40:30.595 --> 40:33.173
Listen, all I want
is for you to be happy.

40:33.197 --> 40:35.609
So if Reggie makes you happy,

40:35.633 --> 40:38.545
then that's great.

40:38.569 --> 40:41.749
I'll call before I stop in next time.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.717
Okay? Okay.

40:43.741 --> 40:45.286
Love you.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.269
Push yourself out of your comfort zone.

41:00.175 --> 41:02.175
Follow through on your commitments.

41:11.440 --> 41:13.037
Try something new.

41:22.241 --> 41:24.241
Let go of the past...

41:37.446 --> 41:39.446
...and dive in to the future.
