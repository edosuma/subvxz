Yeah.

04:29.320 --> 04:30.367
Well?

04:32.200 --> 04:33.690
"M" is my mother.

in some kind of trouble.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.488

04:49.240 --> 04:50.571
When did you find this out?

04:50.640 --> 04:51.641
Last year.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.643
When you were in the
coma, she showed up.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.164
Where?
Here.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.241

lot going on that night.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.001
Do you remember, when you asked
about the broken window,

05:08.120 --> 05:09.963
I said a bird flew into it?

05:10.080 --> 05:12.082
Well, that's not
exactly what happened.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.123
A guy broke into the house, and
he was waiting here for me. Look.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.089
There's another mark up here

05:25.560 --> 05:27.050
from where I took a shot at him.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.161
With your gun?

05:29.240 --> 05:31.561
Crossbow, actually,
but that's beside the point.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.930
I could have died if it
hadn't been for my mother.

know who it was.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.809
And I recognized her voice,
and I knew it was her.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.924
So...

06:09.000 --> 06:12.288
So she didn't die in
the accident, but...

06:14.640 --> 06:16.961
A friend of hers was
with my dad that night.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.851
And the people who killed my
parents thought it was her,

06:20.920 --> 06:24.208
and she thought she was protecting
me by staying out of my life.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.849

this in one night?

06:26.920 --> 06:28.331

06:33.120 --> 06:35.361
Why didn't you tell me till now?

06:36.200 --> 06:39.010
Well, we weren't exactly
together until now.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.450
And...

06:43.880 --> 06:46.850
Because she's like me.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.041

out until she showed up.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.449
Imagine my surprise.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.771
Why didn't she stay?

07:07.920 --> 07:09.410
She had to go

07:10.000 --> 07:13.049
because of some things
that she did here.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.287
And that message means
that she's in trouble.

I can do to help her.

14:04.640 --> 14:05.801
David Florez.
Local hothead.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.211
Whenever we show up, he shows up

14:07.280 --> 14:08.520
to tell us how
badly we're screwing up.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.284
So crime's our fault?
Seems to be.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.370
WU: Typical stop and rob.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.125
Two guys came in waving
guns, emptied the register.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.170
They wore masks so we're not getting
much in the way of a description.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.401
I think we already got them.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.084
Wait, what? How?

14:21.160 --> 14:23.162
We got two bodies
around the corner.

14:23.240 --> 14:26.323
Guns, masks, and a bag of money.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.164
Somebody killed them?

14:28.240 --> 14:29.401
And left the money behind?

14:29.480 --> 14:31.084
If they're our guys.
Who did it?

14:31.640 --> 14:33.483
Don't know. It's what
we call "a mystery."

14:33.600 --> 14:35.204
That's what that is.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.281
Security cams up?

14:36.360 --> 14:37.361
System's in back.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.565
Back it up a few minutes before.

14:47.640 --> 14:51.247
Somebody might have seen 'em on
the street before they came in.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.766
This guy left two and a half
minutes before the robbery.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.604
That'd put him in
the witness ballpark.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.011
Let's see who's next.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.606
She might have seen them.

14:59.680 --> 15:00.806
Anybody else?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.411
If this guy left
just before they came in

15:03.480 --> 15:05.164
he might have seen
them go in, come out...

15:05.240 --> 15:06.480
Or what happened to them.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.050
See if we can ID these three.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.407
Bring 'em in.
Yeah. Will do.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.241
Where the hell is Višnja Gora?

15:32.320 --> 15:34.607
I didn't see anybody
after I left the store.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.611
No dogs either.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.727
I drove right home.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.724
I heard what happened as soon
as I got back to my apartment.

15:40.800 --> 15:41.847
It's terrible.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.931
I was hoping this
neighborhood would be safer.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.128
I'm afraid I
didn't see anything.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.964
At least not
that I can remember.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.125
I wish I could be more helpful.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.249
As soon as I left the store I
got on a bus and headed home.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.970
What bus did you take? The 72.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.769
How far was the bus
stop from the store?

15:57.840 --> 15:59.080
It's just down the street.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.844
And did you see anything?

16:00.920 --> 16:03.730
I'm sorry. No. I had
to run for the bus.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.201
So you live in the neighborhood
and you took the bus.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.883
Yeah. It's only one stop,
but I had groceries.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.849
Did you see any
loose dogs on the street?

16:12.760 --> 16:13.807
No.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.564
There are a lot of kids
in the neighborhood

16:15.920 --> 16:17.285
and we've got two dead men.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.328
If there are any dangerous
animals running around,

16:19.400 --> 16:21.000
you should help us
do something about it.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.086
There's this one guy,
Ray Bolton.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.400
He has dogs.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.486
I heard he fights
'em on weekends.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.164
I know they get out sometimes.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.402
But, look, this guy is...

16:37.200 --> 16:38.690
You can't be saying I told you.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.401
We won't.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.442
Hey. I thought
you'd be asleep.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.360
I can't sleep. Not with
all that's going on.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.805
What's going on?

16:56.880 --> 16:58.325
Look what I found.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.442
Višnja Gora.
It's in Slovenia.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.681
Right in the middle.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.525
And we care about that because?

17:08.599 --> 17:10.840
Because that is where your
mom's e-mail was sent from.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.365
I mean, she said
she was in danger,

17:12.440 --> 17:13.930
so I thought I'd better look
into where it came from,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.207
so I tracked the IP address of
the server it was sent from.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.407
I wish I could track down the
actual address she sent it from,

17:18.480 --> 17:20.403
but for that I would
need access to the ISP,

17:20.480 --> 17:22.323
which, you know,
I obviously don't have.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.084
So she's in Slovenia?

17:25.160 --> 17:26.605
Or was when she
sent the e-mail.

17:26.680 --> 17:27.880
What kind of trouble is she in?

17:27.920 --> 17:29.680
She's a Grimm. A lot of
people want her dead.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.889
She's on her way to Greece,

17:32.960 --> 17:35.361
and she's out there all alone.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.966
What you got there?

17:43.080 --> 17:44.366
Ray Bolton.

17:44.440 --> 17:45.851
The guy with the dogs?
Yeah.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.610
Professional bad guy.

17:47.680 --> 17:51.321
Convictions for assault, narcotics
distribution, and illegal firearms.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.640
That's a nice way
to start the morning.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.290
It gets better.

17:54.360 --> 17:55.805
Our two dead guys,
Guzman and Otero,

17:55.880 --> 17:57.325
are known associates of Bolton.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.481
Are we thinking he killed them?

17:58.560 --> 17:59.686
Got motive.

17:59.760 --> 18:02.650
Guzman testified against him on
a narcotics charge last year.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.405
Could have turned his dogs
on them and got Otero too.

18:06.560 --> 18:07.925
Guess we'd better check 'em out.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.968
Let's get animal control
to meet us out there

18:10.040 --> 18:12.202
in case Bolton's
dogs killed those guys.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.845
(ALL BARKING)

18:18.840 --> 18:20.285
Who are you?
Ray Bolton.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.930
We're investigating
a possible murder.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.604
We need to check out your dogs.

18:23.680 --> 18:24.761
My dogs didn't do nothing.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.604
The two victims
were old pals of yours,

18:26.680 --> 18:28.603
Eddie Otero and Alfredo Guzman.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.489
We have reason to believe
they were killed by dogs.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.483
And they need to be swabbed.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.129
Hey, you ain't taking my dogs.

18:38.440 --> 18:39.521
Yes, we are.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.284
And if they weren't
involved you get 'em back.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.045
I said you ain't taking my dogs.
Get your hands off of me!

18:46.080 --> 18:47.491
Grimm.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.449
You're not taking my dogs!

18:53.560 --> 18:55.280
We're taking your dogs
and we're taking you.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.089
DAVID: Hell, yeah.
Hell, yeah!

18:57.160 --> 18:58.810
It's about time you got
this trash off the street.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.729
Him again? Called you 100
times about this dude.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.847
Stay back, sir.

19:01.920 --> 19:02.967
That's right, lock his ass up.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.247
You keep talking, bro.
Keep talking.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.891
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

19:07.080 --> 19:08.320
Now what?

19:17.080 --> 19:18.445
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

19:19.360 --> 19:20.850
Rosalee, can you get that?
ROSALEE: Got it.

19:20.920 --> 19:21.967
Thanks.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.761
I'll probably be home a little late
tonight. I'm expecting a delivery.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.971
Hello? Hello?

19:29.040 --> 19:31.327
WOMAN: I think I have
the wrong number.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.169
Are you looking for Monroe?

19:33.240 --> 19:34.366
Oh, yes.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.851
May I say who's calling?

19:35.920 --> 19:37.445
His mother.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.842
It's your mother.
Does she know that we're...

19:43.360 --> 19:44.566
No.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.931
Not yet.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.804
Let me talk to her.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.123
Hey, Mom.
How are you?

19:54.600 --> 19:57.888
I don't suppose that was the cleaning
lady who answered the phone.

19:57.960 --> 20:02.124
No, Mom, that was Rosalee.
She's my girlfriend.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.487
Oh! You've got
a girlfriend.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.010
When did that happen?

20:07.080 --> 20:08.320
Awhile ago.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.528
Well, you sound kind of busy.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.364
Call us back when
you have a chance.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.847
Yeah. That's a good idea.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.046
Okay, love you.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.804
We love you too.

20:25.640 --> 20:29.804
I guess we should probably tell
our parents what we're doing.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.201
Now that we're doing it, yeah.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.446
I mean, we're grown people.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.090
We're adults.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.449
So when do you
think we should...

20:37.520 --> 20:38.931
Later.
Right.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.241
Okay. Bye.
Bye.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.731
He knows what you are.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.564
What's he?
I'm not sure.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.205
Looked sort of like a Hundjager

20:47.280 --> 20:48.611
mixed up with a Daemonfeuer.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.570
I have no idea what you're talking
about, but he could be our guy.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.086
He didn't seem too bothered
about me being a Grimm.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.889
Wait till he gets
to know you better.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.050
You got no right
to do this to me.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.441
What? Didn't he attack
an officer of the law?

21:00.520 --> 21:01.720
I remember something like that.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.000
Anything happens to my dog...

21:03.080 --> 21:04.286
Shut up.

21:04.360 --> 21:05.850
Only thing we
want to hear from you

21:05.920 --> 21:07.570
is why you killed
Guzman and Otero.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.001
I had nothing to do with that.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.121
No?

21:10.480 --> 21:11.891
Guzman testifies against you,

21:11.960 --> 21:13.080
you got no problem with that?

21:13.120 --> 21:14.406
That case got thrown out.

21:14.480 --> 21:17.290
And you don't hold grudges.
You're such a forgiving guy.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.362
People always get
what's coming to 'em.

21:19.440 --> 21:22.842
You sic your dogs on him, or
did you rip him up yourself?

21:22.920 --> 21:24.445
Yeah, that's right.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.730
My dogs could have done it or I
could have done it, but we didn't.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.451
I was at home with my lady,
nowhere near those fools.

21:30.840 --> 21:33.650
Swab my dogs all you want,
'cause you got nothing.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.006
I'm gonna sue your dumb asses.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.000
We got motive.

21:45.080 --> 21:46.525
Yeah, but no evidence
to tie him to it.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.320
If the girlfriend corroborates, and
she will, we won't get a warrant.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.249
WU: Got your report
from animal control.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.651
Don't think
you're gonna like it.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.643
Hair and saliva
from Bolton's dogs

21:54.720 --> 21:57.007
don't match what they
found on the bodies.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.241
They'd like to
take the dogs back,

21:58.320 --> 21:59.970
but you got the owner locked up.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.166
What do you want me to tell 'em?

22:01.240 --> 22:03.083
Tell them the owner
assaulted a police officer

22:03.160 --> 22:05.208
and we're going to
keep him for a while.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.884
They should do
the same with the dogs.

22:06.960 --> 22:07.961
Copy that.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.364
If Bolton is what I saw,

22:15.440 --> 22:17.283
then he's more than capable
of killing those guys

22:17.360 --> 22:18.725
the way that they were killed.

22:18.800 --> 22:22.009
Then he wouldn't have needed his
dogs, but the dogs were good cover.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.526
We look at the dogs and not him.
We should be swabbing him.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.602
Even if that comes up positive,

22:26.680 --> 22:28.523
how do we explain
how he did what he did?

22:28.600 --> 22:30.602
Let's swab the son
of a bitch anyway.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.045
I want him to know that we know.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.764
I want to know what
we're dealing with.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.241
JULIETTE: No dog did this.

22:37.320 --> 22:38.367
How can you tell?

22:38.440 --> 22:41.523
Usually when a dog or coyote
or wolf bites down in attack

22:41.600 --> 22:44.251
it'll shake the victim and you'd
see more tearing in the wounds.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.288
Who wants more caprese? Me.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.646
Definitely not a Blutbad.

22:47.760 --> 22:50.366
FYI, too much general mangling.

22:50.680 --> 22:55.049
We're more of a throat first and
ask questions later Wesen. Plus...

22:57.000 --> 22:59.606
Yeah, there's no signs of
going after the legs first

22:59.680 --> 23:00.841
to cripple the prey.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.804
Sorry. Victim.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.211
Which is what a canine would do,

23:05.320 --> 23:08.290
so, yeah, you're probably dealing
with a Wesen and powerful.

23:08.360 --> 23:10.647
You don't know what kind of
Wesen you're dealing with?

23:10.720 --> 23:13.803
A sort of part Hundjager,
part Daemonfeuer.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.322
That sounds like a...
Hóllentier.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.011
Exactly what I was thinking.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.761
Big-ish eyes, snouty-ish,
brutish, neanderthal-esque.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.086
Basically a jerkwad.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.366
That's him.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.125
Because a Hóllentier
could definitely do that.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.760
What does Hóllentier mean?
Is it German?

23:30.800 --> 23:32.848
Basically, it means
"beast from hell."

23:32.920 --> 23:34.600
They actually have
a really ancient lineage

23:34.640 --> 23:36.483
all the way back
to the Egyptians.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.009
How did he react to you?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.160
He didn't seem to
care all that much.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.085
Definitely a Hollentier then.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.764
This Wesen wasn't afraid of you?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.171
He didn't appear to be.

23:49.280 --> 23:52.204
Your basic Hollentier is too stupid
to know what to be afraid of.

23:52.280 --> 23:55.443
Which is why the Egyptians used to
entomb them with their pharaohs.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.601
They thought it was a promotion

23:56.680 --> 23:58.364
until, you know,
they buried 'em alive.

23:58.440 --> 24:01.330
Can somebody pass the,
what do you call it?

24:02.360 --> 24:04.647
The artichokes or
the edamame tabouleh?

24:05.600 --> 24:06.601
Both?

24:07.880 --> 24:09.530
So where is this Hollentier now?

24:10.360 --> 24:11.805
We've got him locked up.

24:11.880 --> 24:15.885
Hey, you put a pharaoh in there
with him, he'll stay forever.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.045
Just saying.

25:16.680 --> 25:17.681
(SCREAMING)

25:20.120 --> 25:21.531
Stop!

25:22.760 --> 25:24.444
Stop! Quit fighting!

25:27.280 --> 25:28.520
(CREATURE GROWLING)

25:50.200 --> 25:52.168
So, the guy drags the woman here

25:52.240 --> 25:54.083
to assault her,
then gets annihilated.

25:54.160 --> 25:55.241
And Bolton's locked up.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.049
It wasn't him.
We have to let him go.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.485
Can't say I'm happy about that.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.008
Now we got three vics
in the same neighborhood.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.690
All bad guys.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.240
Seems like we got
a vigilante on our hands.

26:06.720 --> 26:07.767
Vigilante Wesen.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.928
Would the witness have seen him?
Possibly.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.040
But even if she did, she
wouldn't know what she saw.

26:13.520 --> 26:14.567
Don't I know it.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.371
EMTs are through treating Ms. Ramos.
She's pretty shook up.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.842
She's got more to say.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.365
Florez is back.

26:21.440 --> 26:22.646
Not again.

26:25.760 --> 26:28.445
Is he dogging us or does
he get here before we do?

26:28.520 --> 26:29.760
We should run him and make sure.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.165
Yeah.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.446
I'm Detective Burkhardt
and this is Detective Griffin.

26:36.520 --> 26:37.601
You Ms. Ramos?

26:37.680 --> 26:38.920
Yes.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.123
Do you feel up to answering
a few questions?

26:42.000 --> 26:43.081
I can.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.770
Did you know
the man who attacked you?

26:46.480 --> 26:47.481
No.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.410
Had you ever seen him before?

26:50.800 --> 26:52.040
No.

26:52.600 --> 26:55.683
Can you tell us what you saw
after you got off the bus?

26:58.520 --> 27:00.363
I walked down the street.

27:01.360 --> 27:05.160
I heard someone following
me and I turned to look,

27:05.840 --> 27:08.491
but he turned away
and went down another street.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.487
I thought I was being paranoid.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.162
That's when he attacked me.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.971
I tried to scream,
but he hit me...

27:19.040 --> 27:21.771
And knocked me down
and was going to...

27:26.400 --> 27:28.164
I don't know what happened next.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.890
I'm sorry.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.049
It was horrible.

27:34.640 --> 27:35.687
Horrible.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.488
Can you describe who killed
the man that attacked you?

27:48.720 --> 27:51.724
Just try to tell
us what you saw.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.405
El Cucuy.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.165
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

27:58.640 --> 27:59.641
El Cucuy.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.811
Is that a name?

28:06.680 --> 28:09.160
Do you know this El Cucuy?

28:11.360 --> 28:12.725
We all do.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.689
We know what El Cucuy is?

28:23.760 --> 28:24.886
Not a clue.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.485
She said everybody knows it.

28:27.160 --> 28:28.685
Everybody except us.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.205
Got to be Spanish, right?

28:30.280 --> 28:31.361
Sounds like.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.561
Juliette?

28:32.640 --> 28:33.801
Think so.

28:36.520 --> 28:37.931
Now you see that?

28:37.960 --> 28:40.088
Somebody doing your job.
WU: Hey!

28:40.160 --> 28:41.400
Cleaning up the streets. Hey!

28:41.480 --> 28:43.482
Hey, that's enough. Move on.
Time to go home.

28:43.960 --> 28:46.884
Mr. Florez is starting
to get on my nerves.

28:53.480 --> 28:56.051
El Cucuy.
Ever heard of it?

28:56.480 --> 28:59.290
Yeah, actually.
It's like the boogeyman.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.124
A bunch of different
names for it in Spanish.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.089
My grandma used
to call it El Coco.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.889
And whenever I was bad,
like I wouldn't go to bed,

29:04.960 --> 29:06.200
she would say it was
gonna come and get me

29:06.280 --> 29:07.770
or if I didn't make the bed,

29:07.840 --> 29:09.205
it would be hiding under
the bed waiting for me,

29:09.280 --> 29:12.045
or if I didn't
eat my vegetables...

29:12.120 --> 29:13.120
You get the picture.

29:13.160 --> 29:14.571
You mean it's not real?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.162
Well, when you're a little
kid, everything's real.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.087
Why, who told you
about El Cucuy?

29:20.160 --> 29:21.286
The victim.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.642
She said El Cucuy killed
the man that attacked her.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.887
She said it was El Cucuy?

29:29.360 --> 29:30.361
Wow.

29:31.080 --> 29:33.560
So, what, are you
thinking it's Wesen?

29:33.640 --> 29:36.007
We don't know
what we're thinking.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.808
There's actually
somebody who might know.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.367
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

29:41.440 --> 29:44.523
It's so good to see you,
my dear. Please come in.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.762
I'm glad things have
worked out for you.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.401
Thank you, Pilar. Me too.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.005
This is Nick, he's...

29:53.080 --> 29:54.366
I know who he is.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.284
You are interested in El Cucuy.

29:59.520 --> 30:02.490
Yeah, a woman was attacked
by a man that was killed.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.881
And she says it was El Cucuy
that saved her life.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.040
I could sense it...

30:08.920 --> 30:10.206
You could sense what?

30:11.520 --> 30:13.488
I could sense it was coming.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.803
Please sit.

30:18.560 --> 30:22.690
When I was
a child in Guadalajara,

30:22.760 --> 30:25.081
there was a time
of great sorrow.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.409
No one was safe.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.571
The people of my neighborhood
were being terrorized.

30:31.360 --> 30:32.646
I was so scared

30:32.720 --> 30:35.246
I would sleep under
the bed of my parents.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.889
Then one night,

30:37.960 --> 30:40.964
I heard the woman
next door calling,

30:41.040 --> 30:43.691
"El Cucuy, El Cucuy."

30:44.840 --> 30:47.002
Her husband had
been killed that day.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.001
And I heard
another woman calling,

30:51.080 --> 30:53.811
"El Cucuy, El Cucuy,

30:54.200 --> 30:56.089
"come and save us
from this evil."

30:56.680 --> 30:58.808
One house to the other,

30:58.880 --> 31:02.441
night after night,
calling for help...

31:03.160 --> 31:06.642
And just when I thought
it would never get better,

31:06.760 --> 31:09.445
one of the evil men
was dead on our street.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.884
And then another was dead
on another street.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.723
And then a third,

31:15.800 --> 31:19.122
torn up like they had been
attacked by wild dogs,

31:19.600 --> 31:23.844
until no evil men
were left in our barrio.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.848
Have you ever seen El Cucuy?

31:29.320 --> 31:30.401
No.

31:30.480 --> 31:33.006
But one of the women
on my street did.

31:33.120 --> 31:35.726
We asked her what
El Cucuy looked like.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.610
She said its eyes glowed yellow,

31:38.680 --> 31:41.160
its teeth were
sharp like razors,

31:41.240 --> 31:43.322
and its breath was foul

31:43.400 --> 31:46.085
like something who
had eaten the dead.

31:46.160 --> 31:50.131
And it could hear the
cries of those in sorrow.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.367
So you believe.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.847
I believe El Cucuy wanders
from place to place.

32:00.920 --> 32:03.002
And waits until it is called

32:03.080 --> 32:06.448
by voices of women
who have suffered from evil.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.967
If enough voices cry out,

32:09.040 --> 32:13.045
they become one voice
that cannot be ignored.

32:13.680 --> 32:17.162
Then it wakes and hunts.

32:17.840 --> 32:22.562
If El Cucuy is here,
it is to answer that call.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.131
I got nothing.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.563
You find anything?
Lots.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.768
This one is about
a Grimm who tracked down

32:40.840 --> 32:42.604
and beheaded an entire family

32:42.680 --> 32:47.004
of Faeteo fatalis
in... Whoa, in 1655,

32:47.880 --> 32:51.282
who were wreaking havoc in
Vlatos on the island of Crete.

32:52.800 --> 32:53.961
But no.

32:54.040 --> 32:57.169
I haven'nt found anything that
looks or sounds like El Cucuy.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.327
It's a big world,

32:59.400 --> 33:01.323
maybe this is just one they
haven't encountered yet.

33:01.400 --> 33:05.564
Or maybe it's in a book that was
never handed down to my relatives.

33:06.920 --> 33:08.888
Who knows how much
is still out there?

33:11.320 --> 33:12.890
Maybe it isn't even Wesen.

33:29.360 --> 33:33.046
Well, look at you, just walking
the streets like you own them.

33:40.840 --> 33:43.684
This is not your neighborhood.
It's mine.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.842
Disrespect me again,
and they'll never find you...

33:47.960 --> 33:49.689
Or your mother.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.443
You see something?

33:58.120 --> 33:59.804
Take care of this, Paul.

34:01.280 --> 34:02.281
(GRUNTS)

34:04.040 --> 34:05.371
(GROANING)

34:18.600 --> 34:19.965
You got a positive
on our attacker

34:20.040 --> 34:21.405
from last night,
Stephen Stillman.

34:21.480 --> 34:24.484
Last known address,
Vancouver, Washington.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.286
Any link between him,
Otero, Guzman, or Bolton?

34:27.360 --> 34:28.360
None.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.487
What about this Florez who keeps
showing up at the crime scenes?

34:30.560 --> 34:31.721
Florez lives with his mother.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.728
A couple domestic
disturbance calls.

34:33.840 --> 34:38.880
He's a marine, did three tours in
Afghanistan, diagnosed with PTSD.

34:39.679 --> 34:42.286
This marine comes back from
the war, suffering from PTSD,

34:42.360 --> 34:44.089
finds crime on the rise
in his neighborhood,

34:44.159 --> 34:45.810
decides to do
something about it.

34:46.639 --> 34:48.608
Kind of makes sense.
We think he's our guy?

34:48.679 --> 34:50.444
It could be.
We're still working it.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.248
Surveillance footage
from the bus last night

34:53.360 --> 34:54.771
just came in, any takers?

34:54.840 --> 34:56.170
Yeah. Put it up.

34:57.320 --> 35:00.927
This is from
the 75 bus last night.

35:03.640 --> 35:05.529
HANK: That's the victim,
Ms. Ramos.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.964
That's Stillman,
the guy that attacked her.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.441
And the guy in front of him is the
one she thought was following her.

35:11.520 --> 35:12.885
But he turned
down another street.

35:12.960 --> 35:15.167
Well, he might have seen something,
but he didn't come forward.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.208
And we might want to think
about talking... Hey.

35:17.280 --> 35:19.282
Don't we know her?

35:19.360 --> 35:21.442
Yeah, she was at the
convenience store robbery.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.840
We brought her in
for questioning.

35:22.880 --> 35:23.881
Mrs. Garcia, right?

35:23.960 --> 35:25.450
Same woman at two crime scenes?

35:25.560 --> 35:27.085
In the same area apparently.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.722
I think you need to
talk to her again.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.281
David, what's wrong?

35:33.400 --> 35:34.447
They let him out!

35:35.200 --> 35:37.362
Who? The police!
They let him out!

35:37.440 --> 35:39.807
What are you talking about?
Open the door.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.204
Mijo, open this door!

35:42.800 --> 35:43.926
WOMAN: David!

35:44.000 --> 35:46.480
If the police are too scared
to take care of him...

35:46.560 --> 35:48.483
Mijo, open this door!
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

35:49.320 --> 35:50.526
...then I will.

35:52.240 --> 35:53.605
David!

35:53.680 --> 35:55.569
Open this door!

36:03.160 --> 36:04.321
MRS. GARCIA: Who is it?

36:04.400 --> 36:05.845
It's the police,
Mrs. Garcia.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.445
Detectives Burkhardt
and Griffin.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.005
We spoke with you
the other night?

36:10.640 --> 36:13.211
Oh, yes.
I remember.

36:13.280 --> 36:17.410
I'm always a little nervous about
opening my door after dark.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.801
Would you like to come in?
I can make you some tea.

36:20.920 --> 36:23.446
Actually, we'd like you to come
down to the precinct with us.

36:25.320 --> 36:26.560
Have I done something wrong?

36:26.640 --> 36:29.405
No, ma'am. You were on
the 75 bus last night.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.123
Yes, I was.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.281
How did you know?

36:33.760 --> 36:35.808
There are surveillance
cameras on the buses.

36:36.920 --> 36:37.921
Oh.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.041
Can I ask you
what this is about?

36:42.120 --> 36:44.282
We'd rather ask you a few
questions at the precinct.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.840
There are some photos
we'd like you to look at.

36:46.920 --> 36:47.920
Oh, yes.

36:47.960 --> 36:51.282
Well, of course, if you need me to.
I'll just get my coat.

36:51.800 --> 36:55.043
I got to tell you, Nick, I don't
think she's gonna be much help.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.209
I hope you don't mind,

37:07.280 --> 37:11.126
but I don't get many handsome
young men visitors anymore.

Burkhardt.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.089
Call just came in from
David Florez's mother.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.400
She's really upset.

38:15.520 --> 38:18.285
Said he came home furious
that we let Bolton go.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.640
I'm assuming that
means he's going to

38:19.720 --> 38:20.960
Bolton's house to confront him.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.121
How do you want to handle this?

38:22.200 --> 38:25.488
Meet us there. We can
try to intercept him.

38:25.560 --> 38:27.130
We got a problem with Florez.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.242
Apparently he's pretty upset
that we let Bolton go.

38:29.320 --> 38:31.641
Mom called it in, thinks he
might be going after Bolton.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.563
Then we better go.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.848
Sorry, Mrs. Garcia. But we're
gonna have to make a detour.

38:35.920 --> 38:38.321
No problem.

you and everything you stand for.

38:54.720 --> 38:57.160
You are going to leave this place
or I'm gonna make you leave!

38:57.600 --> 38:59.443
DAVID: This is not
your neighborhood!

38:59.760 --> 39:01.171
You do not belong here!

39:01.240 --> 39:03.607
This fool's gonna bring the police.
Get this stuff out of here.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.125

enough the first time?

39:27.600 --> 39:29.204
Stop! Police!

39:32.920 --> 39:35.207
Hey, he came on my property with
that knife. This is self-defense.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.361
Get back in your house.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.760
Arrest him. I'm pressing charges, man.
He tried to kill me!

39:38.800 --> 39:40.325
Get in the house
or we'll arrest you.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.211
Let's call an ambulance.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.890
Let's get him into the car.

39:48.960 --> 39:51.201
You shouldn't
have let him go, man.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.289
DAVID: Shouldn't have
let him go.

39:54.360 --> 39:55.725
Where is she?

39:56.480 --> 39:58.528
She's not here.
Where'd she go?

39:58.600 --> 40:00.443
Dumbass cops, got nothing on me.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.010

You're a Grimm.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.325
I had no idea.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.604
You're 77 years old.

40:43.680 --> 40:44.966
Last month.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.166
You killed Guzman and Otero.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.766

Ms. Ramos under the bridge.

think anyone is

going to believe that
I could do such things?

blood all over you.

Well, yes, you brought me
to Mr. Bolton's house.

41:04.440 --> 41:08.286
And I heard the terrible
screaming, I went in to help.

41:08.400 --> 41:12.450
Oh, I must have gotten all
bloody when I tried to save him.

You don't need to
worry about me anymore.

I have done what I came to do.

41:17.960 --> 41:19.564
The neighborhood is safe again.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.722
And I really
should be moving on.

can just let you go?
