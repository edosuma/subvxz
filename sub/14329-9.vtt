HA HA HA! HA! HA HA!

19:17.322 --> 19:18.657
{\an5}THAT DOES IT.
I'M DONE
WITH FRUITCAKES

19:18.724 --> 19:20.726
AND QUICKSAND FLOORS
AND TOILETS!

19:20.792 --> 19:23.328
WE'RE BREAKING
OUT OF HERE!

19:23.395 --> 19:25.230
WHERE ARE WE GONNA GO,
TIMBUCKTOOTH?

19:25.297 --> 19:27.666
{\an5}WE'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE UNLESS
WE TEAM UP!

19:27.733 --> 19:28.700
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS,

19:28.767 --> 19:30.135
BUT JORGEN'S RIGHT.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.970
I DO ASK MY FAIRIES
FOR TOO MUCH,

19:32.037 --> 19:33.772
BUT I'M TOTALLY
SICK OF THIS PLACE,

19:33.839 --> 19:36.875
{\an5}SO I'M BUSTING
OUT TONIGHT!
NO MAGIC!

19:36.942 --> 19:38.677
NOW ARE YOU WITH ME?

19:38.744 --> 19:40.078
{\an1}I'M IN.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.078
I'M IN.

19:40.145 --> 19:42.581
{\an1}BUT DON'T TOUCH ME
AGAIN.

19:42.648 --> 19:44.383
Wanda: YOU'RE RIGHT, COSMO.

19:44.449 --> 19:48.620
{\an4}MAKING A SAND CASTLE
DOES REALLY GET OUR MINDS
OFF OF YOU KNOW WHO.

19:53.258 --> 19:54.293
I DON'T WANT
SANDY TIMMY.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.595
I WANT REAL,
NOT-SANDY TIMMY!

19:56.662 --> 19:59.097
I'M WET AND HUNGRY
AGAIN!

19:59.164 --> 20:01.934
{\an1}WAIT A MINUTE.
WE CAN GO VISIT HIM.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.904
{\an5}YOU'RE RIGHT!
TO THE REAL,
NOT-SANDY TIMMY!

20:05.971 --> 20:08.173
{\an1}Jorgen: TIME FOR BED,
OVER-WISHING WIMPS.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.743
{\an1}LIGHTS OUT.
NONESCAPE LASERS ON.

20:14.646 --> 20:17.516
OK. LET'S DO THIS.

20:17.583 --> 20:20.385
BUT HOW? JORGEN
LOCKED THE DOOR.

20:20.452 --> 20:23.689
DOORS? WE DON'T
NEED DOORS.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.225
GERONIMO!

20:29.394 --> 20:31.797
{\an1}MOVE OUT!

20:31.863 --> 20:34.733
[PANTING]

20:34.800 --> 20:37.903
AAH! IT'S OUR
WORST FEARS!

20:37.970 --> 20:39.271
THEY WANT MY BLUBBER.

20:39.338 --> 20:42.574
NO. THEY'RE OUR
TICKET TO FREEDOM.

20:42.641 --> 20:45.077
OH, NO!
EVIL VICKYBOT,

20:45.143 --> 20:47.112
{\an5}PLEASE DON'T HACK
THESE SPECIAL
ANKLE BRACELETS

20:47.179 --> 20:47.713
OFF OUR LEGS.

20:47.779 --> 20:50.182
WE LOVE THEM SO.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.952
FEELING SCARED YET?

20:54.019 --> 20:55.687
TERRIFIED.

20:55.754 --> 20:56.421
I REALLY AM.

20:56.488 --> 20:58.890
COME ON!

20:58.957 --> 21:01.460
{\an4}AAH!

20:58.957 --> 21:01.460
AAH!

20:58.957 --> 21:01.460
AAH!

21:01.526 --> 21:03.228
MOLLY, SNAKE TIME.
YOU CAN DO IT.

21:08.433 --> 21:11.370
{\an5}HEY. I GOT OVER
MY FEAR OF SNAKES
WITHOUT WISHING.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.138
{\an4}YEAH, BUT WE
STILL HAVE TO GET
OVER THE WALL.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.841
DWIGHT, GRAB
THE HARPOON.

21:15.907 --> 21:18.877
{\an1}IT DOESN'T WANT
YOUR BLUBBER.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.112
I'M NOT A WHALE.

21:20.178 --> 21:22.748
I AM NOT A WHALE!

21:22.814 --> 21:24.783
HA HA HA!
I DID IT!

21:24.850 --> 21:26.518
TIME TO CLIMB!

21:35.494 --> 21:37.696
NOW WHAT?

21:37.763 --> 21:39.965
{\an1}TIMMY! OH,
WE MISSED YOU!

21:40.032 --> 21:41.733
IT TOOK US FOREVER
TO FIND THIS PLACE.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.603
SO THESE ARE
YOUR FAIRIES?

21:44.670 --> 21:46.238
{\an1}YEP!

21:44.670 --> 21:46.238
PRETTY LAME.

21:46.304 --> 21:47.706
YOU'RE NO PRIZE
YOURSELF, SISTER.

21:47.773 --> 21:48.840
I THINK
THEY'RE CUTE!

21:48.907 --> 21:50.842
AWKWARD.

21:50.909 --> 21:53.545
{\an1}OH, NO! JORGEN KNOWS
WE'VE ESCAPED!

21:53.612 --> 21:55.947
{\an4}QUICK. MAKE A WISH,
AND WE'LL GET YOU
OUT OF THIS DUMP.

21:56.014 --> 21:58.016
{\an1}NO. I REALLY
OVER-WISHED YOU GUYS,

21:58.083 --> 21:59.351
AND I'M SORRY.

21:59.418 --> 22:00.986
WE'LL TAKE THIS ONE.

22:01.053 --> 22:01.887
HOW?

22:01.053 --> 22:01.887
HOW?

22:01.953 --> 22:03.055
WE ARE DOOMED!

22:03.121 --> 22:06.458
{\an1}LET'S JUST SAY IT'S TIME
TO TAKE OUT THE TRASH.

22:06.525 --> 22:09.695
{\an1}3, 2, 1!

22:11.530 --> 22:12.531
{\an1}JUMP!

22:12.597 --> 22:14.266
AAH!

22:17.102 --> 22:19.504

22:17.102 --> 22:19.504
YEAH!

22:19.571 --> 22:22.407
TOUCHING.

22:22.474 --> 22:23.842
{\an1}AND NOW WE'RE DOOMED,
RIGHT?

22:23.909 --> 22:27.045
NO, BUT I WILL
GIVE YOU A HINT.

22:27.112 --> 22:29.214
YOU HAVE GRADUATED!
OH, DANG.

22:29.281 --> 22:31.750
{\an1}WHOO-HOO!

AND SUCCESSFUL ESCAPE

22:33.985 --> 22:36.121
NOT BY WISHING BUT BY WORKING
TOGETHER ON YOUR OWN,

22:36.188 --> 22:39.658
{\an1}AND WHILE I WOULD LIKE
TO PUNISH YOU PAINFULLY,

22:39.725 --> 22:42.794
{\an1}I WILL INSTEAD SAY
CONGRATULATIONS!

22:43.762 --> 22:46.098
{\an4}YEAH!

22:43.762 --> 22:46.098
YAY!

22:43.762 --> 22:46.098
YEAH!

22:46.164 --> 22:47.632
OHH!

22:47.699 --> 22:48.767
{\an1}IRVING, THIS IS
THE BOY WHO TAUGHT ME

22:48.834 --> 22:51.203
NOT TO FEAR BLUBBER.

22:51.269 --> 22:53.004
YOU HAVE
REALLY BIG TEETH.

22:53.071 --> 22:55.874
TIMMY, THIS IS
MY FAIRY SWIZZLE.

22:55.941 --> 22:56.842
WOW! MOLLY'S
A REALLY COOL GIRL.

22:56.908 --> 23:00.278
{\an1}DON'T EVER
TOUCH ME AGAIN.

23:00.345 --> 23:01.847
AND I SEE WHERE
SHE GETS IT FROM.

NOW LET US CELEBRATE!

23:06.718 --> 23:10.222
{\an1}LET US WISH YOU GUYS

23:10.288 --> 23:13.358
{\an1}WAIT. WE WANT TO COOK
