-Yeah.

I've recently lost my trust

only to have a technicality
or a change of heart sink the whole thing.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.283

I think "comprehensive" is the word
you're looking for.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.131
I was gonna go with "abusive."

02:53.215 --> 02:56.218
The FBI doesn't sign that,
then I stop helping with the Panthers.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.762

02:58.846 --> 03:01.431
I won't hesitate to take them to court
if they try to find a loophole.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.238
Impressive scores, Neal.

05:22.531 --> 05:25.909
Then over time, the FBI,
they took notice didn't they, Caffrey?

05:26.451 --> 05:29.913
And he was so good, in fact, that
it took them a while to catch on to him,

05:29.997 --> 05:31.540
but catch on to him they did.

Are you out of your mind?

There's only one reason

I know you and Peter Burke
are still attached at the hip.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.294
Or should I say the ankle?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.088
I'm clean.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.592
Technically, I still work for the FBI
but in reality...

11:56.675 --> 11:58.177
They don't have confidence in me anymore.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.262
I'm just keeping the meter running
until my time is up.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.763
Enough, Neal.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.850
If we can't have
an open and honest conversation,

12:04.933 --> 12:06.268
then I'll go tell Woodford

12:06.351 --> 12:08.395
a more complicated version of
our history together.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.688
It's the truth.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.106
They yanked me from undercover work

12:11.190 --> 12:13.483
and stuck me on some
backlog loan scandal, all right?

12:14.651 --> 12:17.487
Banks don't really like seeing a convicted
criminal walk through their doors,

12:17.571 --> 12:19.323
so the FBI cut my anklet.

12:19.406 --> 12:23.702
Which gives me the chance
to build a little nest-egg on the side.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.037
For when the seasons change.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.164
Now tell me,
why would I ever believe you?

12:27.247 --> 12:28.498
Why wouldn't you?

12:29.458 --> 12:31.376
Peter Burke has violated my trust

12:31.460 --> 12:33.712
over and over again, you know that.

12:33.795 --> 12:37.299
This score is what I need
to break free from the FBI.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.476
I'm not gonna lie, I could use you.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.605
I appreciate your work, Neal.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.106
Always have.

12:53.190 --> 12:54.608
I know you respect mine.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.486
Respect isn't the word I'd choose.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.112
Let's do this together.

13:01.698 --> 13:02.866
Come on, Caffrey.

(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

13:21.134 --> 13:22.135
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.471
You get those agents approved
to protect El?

13:24.555 --> 13:26.306
Two in the front yard, two in the back.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.141
If El goes anywhere, they escort her.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.352
I'll bet she didn't get that perk
in Washington.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.687
Yeah, home sweet home.

13:32.271 --> 13:34.314
What about the benefactor
Keller mentioned?

13:34.398 --> 13:35.691
He say anything else about it?

13:35.774 --> 13:38.652
It could be Woodford or someone else
in the Pink Panthers.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.612
I'll have Jones get on it.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.406
You can never assume
you're in safe waters

13:42.489 --> 13:43.949
even if Keller says he needs you.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.826
You can never assume anything
with Keller.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.202
I walked into the meeting

13:47.286 --> 13:49.955
assuming I'd be tasked
with a huge score, instead...

13:50.038 --> 13:52.749
-You're Mr. Shipping and Handling.
-Yeah.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.543
You know, you have to admit,

13:54.626 --> 13:57.004
the stamp is a pretty
exhilarating mission.

13:57.087 --> 14:00.048
I don't think exhilarating and stamp
have ever been used

14:00.132 --> 14:01.300
in such quick succession.

14:01.842 --> 14:05.345
My dad and I spent Sunday nights
poring over stock books.

14:05.429 --> 14:08.682
-Magnifiers, stamp tongs, hinge mounts.
-Aw...

14:08.765 --> 14:11.268
Wally and the Beav ever stop by
to join in all the fun?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.729
You laugh, but I still have
my membership card

14:13.812 --> 14:15.480
in the American Philatelic Society.

14:15.564 --> 14:19.359
I hope you realize how lucky you are
to have ever kissed a human female.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.947
JONES: This is the Treskilling Yellow.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.033
A Swedish stamp from 1855.

14:26.116 --> 14:29.620
Now, it's usually printed in bluish-green,
but someone messed up one day

14:29.703 --> 14:31.496
and made a small print-run in yellow.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.875
An error printing. Extremely sought after
in the collectables world.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.461
Yeah, well, there only two of these stamps
left in existence,

14:37.544 --> 14:40.005
and one of them was sold
a few years ago to a private collector

14:40.088 --> 14:42.925
-for $2.3 million.
-Ooh...

14:43.008 --> 14:45.219
None of my stamps were worth
more than 60 cents.

14:45.302 --> 14:47.429
I wish any of my mistakes
were that valuable.

(PETER CHUCKLES)

14:48.597 --> 14:50.807
The other specimen,
the one Woodford is after,

14:50.891 --> 14:52.392
is being auctioned off by this woman,

14:53.936 --> 14:55.229
Bianca Esteverena.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.481
Thirty-two, an immigrant from Argentina.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.900
Now, her father left the family
when she was five,

14:59.983 --> 15:01.777
so she was raised by her grandfather,

15:01.860 --> 15:04.696
a professor who laundered art
stolen during World War II.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.074
Nazi profiteers,
sounds like a sweet family.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.243
Yeah, seems as if Grandpa Esteverena

15:09.326 --> 15:11.245
taught his granddaughter
the ropes of the business,

15:11.328 --> 15:13.497
because now she's the Sotheby's
of the black market.

15:13.580 --> 15:17.125
Thieves bring her stolen art, she auctions
it off and takes a healthy cut.

15:17.209 --> 15:18.252
Exactly.

15:18.335 --> 15:21.713
I mean, the auctions are opulent,
organized and incredibly secure.

15:21.797 --> 15:25.217
It's totally secret. We have zero intel
on where these events go down

15:25.300 --> 15:26.844
or what the security measures look like.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.263
We did come through with a warrant
on Bianca's phone records.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.390
She screens any potential client in person

15:31.473 --> 15:33.350
before sending them an invite
to the auction.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.227
The text messages we intercepted

15:35.310 --> 15:37.479
show she's vetting five new clients today.

15:37.563 --> 15:39.982
Now, most of the individuals
are highly visible

15:40.065 --> 15:41.984
and would be difficult to impersonate,

15:42.067 --> 15:43.986
because Bianca does her research.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.320
But we got lucky.

15:46.488 --> 15:49.032
This guy is a different story.
Nathaniel Dietrick.

15:49.116 --> 15:52.578
Comes from an incredibly private family
in Orange County.

15:52.661 --> 15:53.704
Put it this way,

15:53.787 --> 15:56.665
there are more photos of Bigfoot
than there are of him.

15:56.748 --> 15:59.001
It's even hard
to find photos of his family

15:59.084 --> 16:00.878
because they're notoriously camera-shy.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.963
Dietrick left California when he was 18.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.299
All we know is he spent years
in the Turks and Caicos

16:05.382 --> 16:06.884
drinking and spending his family's money.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.427
And doing not much else.

16:08.510 --> 16:11.054
Now he's back and wants
to take over the family business.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.890
The prodigal son returns.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.142
Dietrick arrives at JFK today at noon.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.144
He's set to meet Bianca in a café at 3:00.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.521
He's not going to be there.

when he comes off the plane.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.484
Yeah, stall him with an interrogation.

Precisely, conspiracy to commit art crime.

and drinking partner has returned

16:38.248 --> 16:40.334

But you had the opportunity of a lifetime.

in scoping out the art

16:45.923 --> 16:47.424

-to you.
-What?

You've lifted that glass
a half dozen times,

17:20.082 --> 17:22.251
yet not one drop is drained.

I'm a consistent pourer.

Moz, I think you've lost
your last precious marble.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.593

17:31.677 --> 17:33.011
from sharing a bottle with me.

-You're pregnant.
-Moz.

was delayed

Maybe somebody he met on the flight?

Yeah, or it could be a business partner
we weren't expecting.

Of course I am.

My time is at a premium, Mr. Dietrick.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.525
I don't like being toyed with.

19:09.608 --> 19:11.318
Why would I toy with you?

the only person I deal with

19:24.623 --> 19:25.958
is your father.

Any chance we can convince him
to cooperate?

I mean, plus, call me crazy,

might be a tipoff.

I mean, you've acted like Neal's dad
for years.

much wiser brother.

one of your company at the auction.

Nathaniel, how dare you?

20:31.982 --> 20:34.610

20:34.693 --> 20:35.944
to wait for me.

Sure. Excuse me.

Please.

21:10.229 --> 21:11.897
You'll have to excuse Nathaniel.

he seems to have lost his manners

I'm sorry to have wasted your time,

may have already spoiled the well.

around the corner.

I'm assuming you don't have any children.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.606
How can you tell?

21:56.191 --> 21:59.778
You have a glow of
unencumbered youth, for starters.

22:00.779 --> 22:02.990
Unfortunately, Mr. Dietrick,

22:03.073 --> 22:06.869
flattery and come-ons are currency
that I don't accept.

22:06.952 --> 22:09.162
It's not flattery if it's the truth.

22:11.081 --> 22:13.000
And I'm happily married.

22:13.834 --> 22:16.837
I haven't made a pass
at another woman in 33 years.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.714
I wouldn't know how if I wanted to.

22:20.090 --> 22:22.009
Marriage is tough, but kids...

22:23.010 --> 22:24.261
They'll break your heart.

I've tried to sculpt him into the man
I know he can be.

22:30.434 --> 22:32.853
But at some point he has to grow up,

22:33.687 --> 22:34.938
be his own man.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.066
My own dad made it look easier.

I always thought I'd have
the same relationship with my own son

22:45.032 --> 22:47.910
and then one day I woke up
and realized, maybe I...

22:48.911 --> 22:50.454
I don't really know him.

22:53.999 --> 22:55.083
And I wonder

22:55.209 --> 22:57.419
if there's enough time to make it right.

23:00.422 --> 23:03.383
My father left us when I was five.

23:03.467 --> 23:04.843
I never saw him again.

23:04.927 --> 23:06.011
No.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.682
As long as he's in your life,

23:11.391 --> 23:14.228

to make it right.

23:25.531 --> 23:27.616
Well, while you were catching up
on current events,

23:27.699 --> 23:28.742
I got us an invite.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.619
-Really?
-Yes, really.

23:31.161 --> 23:33.288
The student is now the master.

23:33.372 --> 23:35.749
-No, the master is still the master.
-No.

23:35.832 --> 23:38.794
Yeah, the master is the master.
Always has been. Take this.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.879
Look, there's a hitch.

23:40.963 --> 23:42.881
Bianca won't text us the location

23:42.965 --> 23:44.758
until an hour before the auction.

23:44.842 --> 23:46.927
So we can't run recon beforehand.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.929
We'll have to run a no-huddle offense.

You've already proven
you're not too shabby at improv.

23:58.814 --> 24:02.067
There's still something about Keller
that doesn't add up.

24:02.442 --> 24:03.443
Something?

24:03.986 --> 24:07.906
Well, I mean, the fact that
he didn't give you up right away.

24:07.990 --> 24:10.158
Well, he knows I can be valuable to him.

24:10.242 --> 24:13.078
Well, no matter how much
he admires your skill set,

24:13.161 --> 24:16.915
there's no way he'd trust anyone
who's worked with the FBI.

24:16.999 --> 24:18.959
That's street criminal 101.

24:19.042 --> 24:21.378
You're a street criminal and you trust me.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.005
I made an exception.

24:23.547 --> 24:25.340
Access to your wine collection

24:25.424 --> 24:27.885
was well worth the betrayal
of my principles.

24:27.968 --> 24:30.804
Look, sometimes people like Keller
get so desperate

24:30.888 --> 24:32.264

24:32.764 --> 24:35.184
They don't notice the ground shifting
beneath their feet.

24:36.435 --> 24:37.436
Yeah.

24:47.196 --> 24:49.656

-Did you tell him?
-No, I didn't.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.450
Neal had to pretend to play my son
for the current case.

Hmm. I'm very proud
to have a son like you.

take out the trash, right?

Yeah, and I've got some chores
you can help me with.

Oh, I would love to

25:46.672 --> 25:49.174
but unfortunately I have
a black-market auction to disrupt.

25:49.258 --> 25:50.509
Any word yet from Bianca?

25:50.592 --> 25:52.219
Yeah. I got a text. There is a location.

Auction starts in an hour.

to get there.

is figure out where the stamp
is actually being held.

a secure room somewhere.

I'll distract the guards by acting lost.

27:21.517 --> 27:22.768
I'll slip in and grab the stamp

33:10.490 --> 33:13.535
I talked to two people at the prison,
the captain and the warden.

33:13.952 --> 33:15.913
And both of them confirm
what's on that rap sheet.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.416
You know what that word means?

33:21.460 --> 33:22.669
NEAL: Incarcerated.

33:22.753 --> 33:25.339
According to the Russians,
Keller is still in prison.

33:26.423 --> 33:27.466
Doesn't make sense.

33:27.549 --> 33:29.051
Unless his benefactor is someone

33:29.134 --> 33:31.136
who wanted it to look like
he's still behind bars.

33:31.220 --> 33:32.721
Keep the tracks covered.

33:33.597 --> 33:35.474
Nobody would suspect you of a crime

33:35.557 --> 33:37.059
if they knew
you weren't able to commit it.

33:37.142 --> 33:39.144
If the Panthers can pull off
a sleight of hand like that,

33:39.228 --> 33:41.021
they got their fingers
in the highest reaches

33:41.104 --> 33:42.105
of the Russian government.

33:43.774 --> 33:45.859
I have some disappointing news
of my own.

33:47.569 --> 33:51.281
Normally, we'd be able to use
seized evidence in an ongoing case,

33:51.365 --> 33:53.742
but it's different
when the evidence in question

33:53.825 --> 33:55.786
belongs to someone overseas.

33:55.869 --> 33:57.079
The stamp.

33:57.162 --> 33:59.581
I tried to buy us time, but it's protocol.

33:59.665 --> 34:04.002
The bureau had to report it
to an international database.

34:04.086 --> 34:06.255
Swedish government informed us
this morning

34:06.338 --> 34:08.340
that it was stolen
from a private collection,

34:08.423 --> 34:09.967
and they're not cooperating.

34:10.050 --> 34:11.385
So what am I supposed to
give the Panthers?

34:11.468 --> 34:12.469
Nothing.

34:13.595 --> 34:16.223
I can't have you walk back in there
without the stamp.

34:16.306 --> 34:17.850
I'm pulling the plug on this operation.

34:17.933 --> 34:19.351
No, absolutely not.

34:19.434 --> 34:21.979
Neal! You can't walk back
in there empty-handed.

34:22.062 --> 34:23.480
You know how dangerous the Panthers are.

34:23.564 --> 34:24.940
We had a deal.

34:25.566 --> 34:26.733
(SIGHS)

34:26.817 --> 34:27.943
You can't do this to me again.

34:28.026 --> 34:29.695
I'm trying to protect you.

34:29.778 --> 34:31.905
I don't need you to protect me,
I can protect myself.

34:31.989 --> 34:34.449
-Is your freedom worth dying for?
-It might be.

34:37.911 --> 34:39.162
I'm taking this with me.

34:39.746 --> 34:41.039
A little motivational aide.

34:41.915 --> 34:43.542
I gave you my word!

34:43.625 --> 34:46.461
-I will get you your freedom.
-Your word?

34:47.629 --> 34:50.299
I'll get my freedom myself
when I take down the Panthers.

35:01.185 --> 35:02.519
MOZZIE: This is insanity, Neal.

35:02.644 --> 35:05.731
There's no way you can craft
a convincing forgery in the time you have.

35:05.814 --> 35:07.065
X-Acto.

35:07.983 --> 35:11.069
Look, I have to try something,
even if my chances are slim.

35:11.153 --> 35:13.405
This is too important an opportunity
to pass up.

35:13.488 --> 35:15.741
You're not presenting
a knock-off Remington

35:15.824 --> 35:18.327
to some leather-faced dingbat on Key West.

35:18.410 --> 35:20.579
-This is the Pink Panthers.
-Hair dryer.

35:22.247 --> 35:25.209
If they use Keller to verify
the stamp's authenticity...

35:25.292 --> 35:26.543
He might let me off the hook.

35:26.627 --> 35:28.295
Or use it as evidence to bury you.

35:28.670 --> 35:31.548
Maybe you're right. I don't know. Okay?

35:32.132 --> 35:35.302
I mean, what kind of benefactor
could possibly get you out of prison?

35:35.385 --> 35:37.804
-(WHIRRING)
-And make it look like you're still there?

35:38.639 --> 35:39.681
Mafia?

35:39.765 --> 35:42.100
They're not good enough
to pull off the cover-up.

35:42.184 --> 35:45.771
And it's not the Panthers. I mean,
they can steal pretty much anything,

35:45.854 --> 35:49.191
but bureaucratic arm-twisting
isn't one of their specialties.

35:49.274 --> 35:51.777
Who would have the motivation to do it?

35:52.194 --> 35:53.779
Motivation.

36:00.619 --> 36:03.956
Get me the India ink
and the finest brush we got.

36:11.839 --> 36:12.840
Stop.

36:14.216 --> 36:15.384
You got it?

36:16.969 --> 36:18.887
Would I be here if I didn't?

36:41.577 --> 36:42.953
He pulled it off.

36:43.829 --> 36:46.498
This shade of yellow's a dead giveaway
that it's authentic.

36:46.582 --> 36:49.501
See, they used to mix uranium in
with the ink. It gave it a color

36:49.585 --> 36:51.044
that's impossible to fake today.

36:54.715 --> 36:56.049
Good job.

36:59.011 --> 37:00.804
Unexpected, Mr. Caffrey.

37:02.139 --> 37:03.599
Icing on the cake.

37:05.142 --> 37:08.145
Bianca Esteverena
is on the cutting edge of technology.

37:08.228 --> 37:10.022
She spares no expense.

37:10.105 --> 37:14.443
The security system she employs is
operated by a highly sophisticated firm

37:14.526 --> 37:16.153
-called Braxnet Security.
-Braxnet Security.

37:16.236 --> 37:18.906
Yeah, I recognized the system
as soon as I entered.

37:18.989 --> 37:21.158
-It's impenetrable.
-Precisely.

37:21.992 --> 37:23.410
You wanted me to fail.

37:24.036 --> 37:25.412
And yet here you are.

37:26.955 --> 37:29.666
The goal of your mission
was to test Braxnet's response

37:29.750 --> 37:31.710
once the alarm was tripped.

37:32.252 --> 37:34.254
Getting the stamp,

37:34.338 --> 37:36.131
a sideshow at best.

37:36.215 --> 37:38.842
We set the odds 100-1 against.

37:39.259 --> 37:40.427
So you were watching.

37:40.511 --> 37:42.095
We had a small team at Bianca's.

37:42.179 --> 37:45.474
Noting the number of guards,
who responded, how quickly they arrived,

37:45.557 --> 37:49.019
their maneuvers, their strengths,
and especially their weakness.

37:50.103 --> 37:52.231
It's all critical information
for what's to come.

37:52.523 --> 37:54.858
And what is to come, exactly?

37:59.154 --> 38:03.951
Oh, Mr. Caffrey, one more thing
that my team noticed at the auction.

38:05.035 --> 38:06.411
A man.

38:07.079 --> 38:09.748
He seemed to be working
right alongside you.

38:11.250 --> 38:12.543
Who is he?

38:13.377 --> 38:15.045
He's a trusted collaborator.

38:15.546 --> 38:18.882
All he knows is I was after the stamp.
He thinks I'm fencing it myself.

38:18.966 --> 38:21.426
Look, he's as discreet as they come.

38:30.727 --> 38:33.480
How long have you
been working for Interpol?

38:33.564 --> 38:35.649
How did you know I was working for them?

38:35.732 --> 38:38.986
Interpol doesn't usually advertise
the names of its associates.

38:39.069 --> 38:42.239
Didn't you once call me a rat
for being a CI for the bureau?

38:42.322 --> 38:45.826
A rat will gnaw through its own leg
if it's in a trap, Caffrey.

38:45.909 --> 38:47.536
I'm less desperate, more enterprising.

38:47.619 --> 38:49.830
That sounds like
a distinction without a difference.

38:49.913 --> 38:51.498
You still haven't answered my question.

38:52.249 --> 38:54.001
How did you know
I was working for Interpol?

38:54.084 --> 38:56.378
I always heard Interpol had
one foot in the future.

38:56.461 --> 38:58.964
They don't slap bulky anklets
on their criminal informants.

38:59.047 --> 39:01.425
That'd be too inelegant, too crass.

39:01.884 --> 39:03.635
Too American. Instead...

39:04.344 --> 39:08.098
They insert chips under the skin
of their informants, like dogs.

39:08.849 --> 39:10.392
It is an ingenious solution.

39:10.851 --> 39:14.813
Except for the pain at the injection sites
and constant, constant itching.

39:18.192 --> 39:19.568
(CHUCKLING)

39:20.277 --> 39:21.528
You know what they call this?

39:21.612 --> 39:23.822
The worst walk along the water
I've had in years?

39:23.906 --> 39:26.200
Mutually assured destruction.

39:26.366 --> 39:27.951
Your collaborator?

39:28.619 --> 39:30.662
Try convincing me it wasn't Peter Burke.

39:33.457 --> 39:34.583
Yeah.

39:35.250 --> 39:38.545
See, you've got something on me,
and I got something on you.

39:38.629 --> 39:41.924
-Yeah, it's almost romantic.
-Till one of us lobs a bomb.

39:42.007 --> 39:43.926
And the other responds
with the apocalypse.

39:44.009 --> 39:47.137
I'll keep that under my pillow tonight.
What's your angle, Keller?

39:47.221 --> 39:48.555
You take down the Panthers, then what?

39:48.639 --> 39:50.599
You do that
and your criminal career's over.

39:50.849 --> 39:52.518
It's freedom, Neal.

39:53.977 --> 39:56.021
See, I got the same deal that you do.

39:56.104 --> 39:59.191
I bring down the Panthers, I'm liberated.

39:59.274 --> 40:00.901
Not even Peter Burke can touch me.

40:00.984 --> 40:02.361
And the stamp?

40:02.986 --> 40:04.488
The Panthers are expecting it
to be fenced.

40:04.571 --> 40:07.407
What are the odds you can find
someone stupid enough to buy it?

40:07.491 --> 40:08.951
I already got a buyer lined up.

40:09.826 --> 40:11.245
(SIGHS) Interpol.

40:11.453 --> 40:12.538
Of course.

40:14.373 --> 40:17.584
You know, I can't say I'm happy
with what you did,

40:17.668 --> 40:20.254
and I certainly wouldn't have condoned it.

40:20.546 --> 40:22.840
-But I'm impressed.
-And I'm worried.

40:22.923 --> 40:26.051
Interpol clearly has no idea
who they're dealing with.

40:26.134 --> 40:27.553
Keller would never go clean.

40:28.345 --> 40:33.183
Right now, we can at least
bask in a little sunshine.

40:34.476 --> 40:35.894
Your contract.

40:42.901 --> 40:43.986
They signed it.

40:46.029 --> 40:47.698
What, no strings attached?

40:47.781 --> 40:50.492
Attorney General came through.
It's ironclad.

40:50.576 --> 40:52.119
Everything you wanted.

40:52.578 --> 40:55.747
You help us bring down the Pink Panthers
and you're home free.

41:03.297 --> 41:04.464
No, no, no.

41:04.548 --> 41:06.425
You are the one who taught me
that it's bad luck

41:06.508 --> 41:08.927
to do a victory dance
before you cross the finish line.

41:09.011 --> 41:11.388
You're right, I did. But come outside.

41:18.770 --> 41:19.938
(SIGHS)

41:20.022 --> 41:21.815
So, I thought we could puff on these

41:21.899 --> 41:25.777
when I do a security check
on the laser fence I just installed here.

41:27.696 --> 41:29.114
No, this is

41:29.781 --> 41:35.204
actually to celebrate a certain paternal
capacity that has recently come to light.

41:35.829 --> 41:39.374
Okay, you're taking this role-playing
thing way too far, Mr. Dietrick.

41:39.583 --> 41:40.751
El's pregnant.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.045
(CHUCKLING)

41:43.128 --> 41:44.213
Yeah.

41:45.881 --> 41:48.800
-Oh, congratulations.
-Thank you. Thanks.

41:50.135 --> 41:51.345
Wow.

41:51.428 --> 41:52.429
Yeah.

41:53.722 --> 41:55.015
We've been trying for years,

41:55.098 --> 41:57.976
and when it didn't happen
we thought it never would.

41:58.936 --> 42:00.312
But then it did.

42:01.355 --> 42:03.982
Based on the 24 hours that
you were my dad,

42:04.066 --> 42:06.568
I'm pretty damn sure
that kid just won the parent lottery.

42:20.123 --> 42:22.292
-To the future.
-To the future.
