(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

00:07.581 --> 00:09.147
Thank you.

00:15.714 --> 00:17.914
Do you not think Medusa's
a bit young for you?

00:17.947 --> 00:19.414
Not to mention slim.

00:19.447 --> 00:23.281
Medusa and I have a bond
that goes beyond
physical appearance.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.647
Does she know that?

00:25.914 --> 00:27.547
Of course she does.

00:28.147 --> 00:29.647
I think she does.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.247
I hope that, with time,

00:31.281 --> 00:34.547
Medusa will come to
realise the strength
of my affection for her.

00:34.581 --> 00:36.581
No. With time,
she will come to realise

00:36.614 --> 00:38.881
that you are a lazy,
no-good,
womanising drunk.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.481
Why would she even
entertain such an idea?

00:40.514 --> 00:43.214
Oh, because of all the rumours
and stories about you.

00:44.914 --> 00:47.681
(CHICKEN CLUCKING)

00:47.714 --> 00:50.247
Any chance you could
see your way to helping us?

00:50.281 --> 00:51.881
I'm carrying the bread, so...

00:52.747 --> 00:53.847
What is the meaning of this?

00:55.481 --> 00:57.447
You are blocking my path.

00:57.481 --> 01:00.887
I am truly sorry, my Lord.
My cart has shed a wheel.

01:00.921 --> 01:02.754
Get it moved out of my way.

01:02.787 --> 01:04.021
That could take some time...

01:06.221 --> 01:08.920
I will not ask you again.

01:08.954 --> 01:11.554
Forgive me, my Lord.
I cannot move it
until the wheel has been...

01:15.254 --> 01:16.654
You dare to touch me?

01:16.687 --> 01:18.954
I would dare to stop you
striking a defenceless old man

01:18.987 --> 01:20.654
-that's done you no wrong.
-(GRUNTS)

01:32.254 --> 01:33.454
You will pay for this.

02:09.627 --> 02:13.694
His name's Heptarian.
He has the protection
of Poseidon.

02:15.494 --> 02:17.327
Is that supposed
to mean
something to me?

02:17.360 --> 02:19.761
It means he's rich
and powerful.

02:19.794 --> 02:22.794
It means you dare not even
touch him, let alone hit him.

02:22.827 --> 02:25.561
Oh, so that means
he can just strike
a defenceless old man?

02:25.594 --> 02:28.261
Absolutely.
He can do as he pleases.

02:28.294 --> 02:32.127
Oh, did I forget to mention
he's also the Queen's nephew?

02:38.994 --> 02:44.194
Speak truthfully,
or face a death curse
upon you.

02:44.227 --> 02:49.427
Did you lay your hands
upon Poseidon's servant,
the Lord Heptarian?

02:53.327 --> 02:55.194
I did.

02:55.227 --> 02:58.261
You have violated
Poseidon's sacred laws.

02:59.767 --> 03:01.934
Such an act
cannot go unpunished.

03:04.201 --> 03:07.434
Do you have anything
to say in your defence?

03:09.267 --> 03:12.001
I was coming to the aid
of an old man.

03:12.034 --> 03:15.101
I could not stand by
and see him struck
when he'd done nothing wrong.

03:16.001 --> 03:17.834
My Lord.

03:17.867 --> 03:19.634
The old man
dishonoured me
with his words.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.401
That's a lie! He's lying!

03:29.301 --> 03:31.967
You dare to raise
your voice to me?

03:33.667 --> 03:35.767
I will have you killed
where you kneel.

03:35.801 --> 03:38.901
(STAMMERS) I must ask leave
to address Your Lordship.

03:40.234 --> 03:43.201
My friend has only recently
arrived in Atlantis.

03:43.234 --> 03:45.601
He's not familiar
with our ways and customs.

03:45.634 --> 03:49.267
And you think
your friend's ignorance
justifies his actions?

03:52.567 --> 03:53.934
No...

03:55.401 --> 03:56.501
And yes.

03:59.541 --> 04:03.541
You dare to defy your king?

04:03.574 --> 04:07.541
(CHUCKLES)
Have you no respect
for the Gods?

04:07.574 --> 04:09.141
I sentence you both
along with him.

04:09.174 --> 04:12.007
Forgive me, my Lord.
That was not my intention.

04:12.041 --> 04:14.574
When the Minotaur was slain,

04:14.607 --> 04:16.841
you said the city owed
us a great debt.

04:18.707 --> 04:20.407
Is not that a consideration?

04:22.474 --> 04:24.541
It is not for me
to punish you.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.574
It is Poseidon
you have wronged,

04:28.674 --> 04:31.107
and it is for him
to decide your fate.

04:31.141 --> 04:32.674
You are his servants.

04:32.707 --> 04:36.507
As such, you have been
called before the bulls.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.407
(WHISPERS)
What does that mean?

04:40.441 --> 04:41.574
It means we're dead.

04:44.274 --> 04:46.141
PASIPHAE:
You have affection
for this boy?

04:47.607 --> 04:50.241
-No.
-Hmm.

04:50.274 --> 04:53.707
A mother can always tell
when her daughter is lying.

04:53.741 --> 04:55.241
You are forgetting
you are not my mother.

04:55.274 --> 04:58.341
And you are forgetting
that you are promised
to Heptarian.

04:59.674 --> 05:03.147
I know.
I mean Heptarian
no disrespect. It's just...

05:03.181 --> 05:06.581
You do not feel for him
as you do this boy.

05:06.614 --> 05:08.547
You are heir to the throne.

05:09.814 --> 05:12.181
Your marriage must be
about more than love.

05:13.581 --> 05:16.547
The very future
of the kingdom
will rest on it.

05:17.914 --> 05:20.447
Was Jason's crime
really so great?

05:21.847 --> 05:25.247
Perhaps if you were
to speak to my father,

05:25.914 --> 05:27.781
he could offer clemency.

05:29.547 --> 05:32.581
The sentence has been passed.
There's nothing I can do.

05:33.947 --> 05:36.381
The boy's fate lies
in the hands of the Gods.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.247
Then I will pray
every day for him.

05:49.081 --> 05:53.214
Why in the name of the Gods
did I open my mouth
to defend you?

05:53.247 --> 05:56.247
That is the last time
I attempt to do
the honourable thing.

05:56.281 --> 05:58.414
So it was the first
and the last.

06:09.887 --> 06:11.987
PALOS: Please. Their irons.

06:12.021 --> 06:14.087
How can they leap
if they're shackled?

06:16.887 --> 06:19.854
I am Palos,
master of the bull court.

06:20.654 --> 06:22.887
I am to be your teacher.

06:22.921 --> 06:24.921
What will you be teaching us?

06:28.587 --> 06:30.454
Do you mean to say
you don't know?

06:30.487 --> 06:34.354
You will find the extent
of his ignorance
truly astonishing.

06:34.387 --> 06:36.454
Perhaps it's best
if I show you.

06:36.487 --> 06:38.054
(GATE CREAKING)

06:52.387 --> 06:54.254
(MEN SHOUTING)

06:56.887 --> 06:59.294
You are to be trained
as bull leapers.

07:01.194 --> 07:04.794
These are the skills
Poseidon demands
of his tributes.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.527
You have only six days
to learn your craft.

07:08.561 --> 07:11.461
And on the seventh,
you will face the bull
before the King and the court.

07:21.561 --> 07:23.661
And only if all
of your team survives

07:23.694 --> 07:25.661
will you leave here
as free men.

07:27.427 --> 07:31.294
I would have to say
the probability of us dying
seems extremely high.

07:31.327 --> 07:34.661
PALOS: Come.
I'll introduce you to the
other members of your team.

07:38.510 --> 07:40.143
You must eat.

07:41.543 --> 07:44.343
You will need
all your strength.

07:44.377 --> 07:46.677
No amount of strength
is going to save us
from that bull.

07:49.310 --> 07:52.777
I may be Poseidon's slave,
but I am not yours.

07:54.243 --> 07:58.777
In my homeland,
I would not keep you
as a slave.

07:58.810 --> 08:01.717
I would not even
let you tend my animals.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.050
In your homeland,

08:04.083 --> 08:07.550
do you sleep with
one eye open for fear
of having your throat cut?

08:08.283 --> 08:10.950
I do not need to,

08:10.983 --> 08:15.417
because my homeland
is not full of cowards
and thieves like you.

08:15.450 --> 08:16.517
(GRUNTS)

08:22.517 --> 08:23.817
Enough!

08:26.783 --> 08:28.083
We are all family here.

08:31.350 --> 08:33.550
These are the new members
of your team.

08:43.250 --> 08:46.417
What are you doing?

08:46.450 --> 08:49.583
If we are to die,
we may as well die
with full stomachs.

08:49.617 --> 08:53.050
Mmm, this stew is excellent.

09:02.757 --> 09:05.223
You wished to see me?

09:05.257 --> 09:07.523
Have you spoken with Ariadne?

09:07.557 --> 09:11.523
I requested an audience,
but I am told that she
will not leave her chambers.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.423
The boy who struck you.

09:17.457 --> 09:20.657
It appears
she has affection for him.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.290
He is no more than a peasant.

09:22.323 --> 09:24.823
Well, that might be so,
but she looks upon him
in a way she does not you.

09:24.857 --> 09:27.090
And that will not serve
our plans at all well.

09:28.390 --> 09:34.223
Perhaps, I was unwise
in my choice
of Ariadne's suitor.

09:34.257 --> 09:36.257
I will gain
Ariadne's affections,

09:36.290 --> 09:39.023
and I will take her
for my wife.

09:39.557 --> 09:41.090
The boy troubles me.

09:41.123 --> 09:44.323
Whatever feelings
Ariadne has for him,

09:44.357 --> 09:46.423
they will be short-lived.

09:46.457 --> 09:49.957
He will be lucky
to last more than a few days
in the bull court.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.090
Hmm.

10:02.397 --> 10:04.030
What is that?

10:04.063 --> 10:08.030
It is the practice animal
on which we are
to learn the basic moves.

10:08.063 --> 10:12.563
Before you face the bull,
you must first learn to leap.

10:12.597 --> 10:16.797
Only when each of you
has leapt the bull
will the dance be over.

10:16.830 --> 10:20.497
Do not be fooled,
it's little like facing
the real thing.

10:22.130 --> 10:23.730
You.

10:23.763 --> 10:25.197
-Me?
-PALOS: You're first.

10:25.230 --> 10:27.063
Let us see
what you're made of.

He will at least
amuse the crowd
before the bull gores him.

11:02.670 --> 11:04.203
They have come
to assess our skills

11:04.237 --> 11:07.037
to see if we are
worthy of a wager.

11:07.070 --> 11:09.103
There's something
about the Queen.

11:09.137 --> 11:11.137
It's as though her eyes
burn through me.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.503
PYTHAGORAS:
There have long been
rumours about her.

11:13.537 --> 11:16.003
Some believe
that she knows
witchcraft.

11:21.070 --> 11:22.870
You. You're next.

11:40.837 --> 11:44.670
It seems your confidence
that the boy would quickly
perish was unfounded.

11:44.703 --> 11:47.503
He is a born bull leaper.

11:47.537 --> 11:50.937
All the while he lives,
Ariadne's affections lie
with him and not you.

11:50.970 --> 11:52.370
I should have
killed him in the street.

11:52.403 --> 11:55.370
And for that
she would have
hated you forever. No.

11:55.403 --> 11:58.437
If we cannot
trust to the Gods,

11:58.470 --> 12:01.010
then we must deal
with him ourselves.

When do you intend to use it?

13:29.517 --> 13:32.583
We must wait
until he performs
for the King.

13:32.617 --> 13:35.750
It must appear that Poseidon
has accepted his sacrifice.

13:37.983 --> 13:43.017
I shall think of some
kind words to say
to Ariadne upon his death.

14:19.823 --> 14:23.590
It is a no better fate
than some of us deserve.

14:23.623 --> 14:26.023
These are Greek bulls.

14:26.057 --> 14:29.557
They will smell
your Nubian blood
and stick you like a boar.

-We're all the same.
-I am a prince
among my people.

14:32.457 --> 14:35.390
He is no more
than a common thief.

14:35.423 --> 14:38.190
The bull will not care
if you're a thief or a prince,

14:38.990 --> 14:40.857
it'll gore you just the same.

I'd die in the arms
of a beautiful woman.

had you for sure.

in my abilities.

For a man
with such confidence,
you looked truly terrified.

17:25.685 --> 17:27.652
That was merely
to fool the bull.

17:27.685 --> 17:29.585
-You know they can smell fear.
-Hmm.

17:29.619 --> 17:32.219

the stench of fear
quite like Hercules.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.785

She is Hercules' woman,

I have affection
only for Medusa.

17:51.252 --> 17:53.319

It has been many weeks
since I visited her.

-I'm hoping
she's got the message.
-You could tell her now.

I long to see them
more than I can say.

18:18.392 --> 18:21.825
Then we must win our freedom
and return you home to them.

18:33.325 --> 18:35.159
I thought you might be hungry.

18:44.725 --> 18:48.159
Before today, I had never
seen Cyrus and Shabaka
smile together.

18:50.659 --> 18:54.259
Last night,
I heard you cry out
in your sleep.

18:57.392 --> 18:59.459
I dream of being
killed by the bull.

18:59.492 --> 19:02.059
Do you ever dream
of being free?

19:02.092 --> 19:04.365
I know what you are
trying to do for us,

19:05.165 --> 19:06.665
and I am grateful for it.

19:07.632 --> 19:08.865
Then join us.

19:08.899 --> 19:11.165
There's much fun
to be had at
Hercules' expense.

19:11.199 --> 19:12.632
(CHUCKLES)

19:15.732 --> 19:17.699
There's something
weighing heavily on me.

19:17.732 --> 19:18.799
What is it?

19:23.532 --> 19:24.899
It's nothing.

19:52.032 --> 19:53.899
(CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)

20:20.839 --> 20:22.572
Everything is ready.

20:22.605 --> 20:25.339
Now we must
wait for the boy
to face the bull.

20:39.139 --> 20:40.505
What is it
you want with Jason?

20:43.172 --> 20:44.439
I don't know what you mean.

20:44.472 --> 20:46.972
When you have
lived with thieves
for as long as I have,

20:47.005 --> 20:48.705
you learn to sleep
with one eye open.

20:49.972 --> 20:51.672
Well, then you
must be very tired.

20:54.139 --> 20:55.872
Not so tired
that I didn't see you

20:55.905 --> 20:57.805
beside Jason's bed
as he slept.

21:03.979 --> 21:05.479
You don't understand.

21:05.512 --> 21:07.745
Then tell me,
so I don't assume
the worst of you.

21:10.012 --> 21:11.779
I know you have a good heart.

21:14.979 --> 21:16.512
I have betrayed you all.

21:16.545 --> 21:18.245
Tell me what it is
you have done
and we will make it right.

21:18.279 --> 21:20.179
What's the meaning of this?

21:21.012 --> 21:23.312
It is nothing.

21:23.345 --> 21:26.712
You'd better get some sleep.
You're facing the bull again
in the morning.

21:29.712 --> 21:33.279
What's the cause
of this ill feeling between
yourself and Elpis?

21:34.812 --> 21:37.512
Cyrus, I'm responsible
for all the bull leapers.

(SIGHS)

21:39.579 --> 21:42.412
If there's something
troubling you,
you should tell me.

21:44.212 --> 21:48.645
Last night, I saw Elpis
cut a lock of
Jason's hair as he slept.

21:50.645 --> 21:51.712
I fear she means him harm.

21:53.245 --> 21:55.079
I cannot understand it.

21:55.779 --> 21:58.479
It is not in her nature.

21:58.512 --> 22:01.112
Have you told anyone else
what you saw?

22:02.145 --> 22:03.952
Only you.

22:03.985 --> 22:06.119
We must keep it that way.

(SNORTS)

22:32.552 --> 22:33.585
What happened?

22:33.619 --> 22:36.185
PALOS: He was gored
when he came to feed the bull.

22:36.219 --> 22:37.719
Even when showing
them kindness,

22:37.752 --> 22:39.285
you can't afford
to lower your guard.

22:41.452 --> 22:43.552
Let that be
a lesson to you all.

22:50.885 --> 22:52.852
PYTHAGORAS: Cyrus was lazy.

22:52.885 --> 22:55.385
He would never
have risen at dawn
to feed the bull.

22:55.419 --> 22:58.185
Then how did he come to be
lying dead in a bullpen?

23:01.419 --> 23:03.092
(SOBBING)

23:20.625 --> 23:22.659

23:27.125 --> 23:30.259
When we were
taken as slaves,

23:30.292 --> 23:33.959
we were only given
meagre rations
as we journeyed to Atlantis.

23:36.659 --> 23:40.192
Cyrus would steal food
from the guards
and share it with me.

23:43.525 --> 23:44.892
(SNIFFLING)

23:47.046 --> 23:49.480
It wasn't a bull
that killed Cyrus.

23:51.646 --> 23:53.780
I believe it was Palos
who took his life.

23:54.446 --> 23:55.680
Why?

23:56.446 --> 23:58.713
I am to blame.

23:58.746 --> 24:01.780
Cyrus saw me steal
a lock of your hair
as you slept.

24:01.813 --> 24:03.786
Why would you steal
a lock of my hair?

24:04.653 --> 24:08.220
Because Palos asked it of me.

24:08.253 --> 24:12.486
In return, he said
that the Lord Heptarian
would grant me my freedom.

24:14.786 --> 24:18.053
(SOBBING)
I do not want my freedom
if this is the cost.

24:27.602 --> 24:31.102
What would they want
with a lock of my hair?

24:31.135 --> 24:34.635
I suspect it is so witchcraft
can be used against you.

24:34.668 --> 24:36.602
How so?

24:36.635 --> 24:39.168
Your hair is
a living part of you.

24:39.202 --> 24:41.335
It can be used
to weave a curse.

24:48.068 --> 24:49.468
Pasiphae?

24:50.802 --> 24:52.302
It would seem
she is behind this.

24:53.235 --> 24:55.268
Why?

24:55.302 --> 24:57.135
Of all the beautiful women
in Atlantis,

24:57.168 --> 25:00.435
you couldn't have chosen
the blacksmith's daughter,

25:00.468 --> 25:03.368
or the baker's daughter,
Maia?

25:03.402 --> 25:07.675
(INHALES) She is lovely.

25:07.708 --> 25:10.742
And you can have all
the bread you can eat.

25:10.775 --> 25:13.875
Oh, no, no.
Only the King's daughter
is good enough for you.

25:15.108 --> 25:17.442
I have barely said
two words to Ariadne.

25:17.475 --> 25:20.375
It isn't about the words.
It's in the eyes.

25:21.408 --> 25:24.708
Is it?
I thought it was the words.

25:24.742 --> 25:28.875
Ah, well, that's
because you are a fool
with no knowledge of women.

25:28.908 --> 25:30.942
And it seems
the Queen has also noticed

25:30.975 --> 25:33.075
the way Ariadne
looks at you.

25:33.108 --> 25:34.908
And now she wants you dead.

25:39.908 --> 25:42.408
I had hoped to escort you
to the bull leaping.

25:44.108 --> 25:45.508
I do not wish to trouble you.

25:45.542 --> 25:48.975
It would be no trouble.
I would enjoy your company.

25:49.008 --> 25:52.408
I take no joy
in watching men die
for my entertainment.

25:54.442 --> 25:57.408
It is for Poseidon
to decide their fate.

25:57.442 --> 25:59.608
Then we must hope
he is merciful.

26:01.608 --> 26:03.842
I am tired.
You will have to excuse me.

26:09.182 --> 26:10.482
Be patient.

26:11.348 --> 26:14.515
The boy will soon
be dead and forgotten.

26:14.548 --> 26:17.415
I cannot believe
the Queen herself
would want me dead.

26:17.448 --> 26:20.348
Do not underestimate
Ariadne's feelings
towards you.

26:20.382 --> 26:21.782
She has the look?

26:21.815 --> 26:24.782
Ah! The man with
the three wives knows
what I'm talking about.

26:24.815 --> 26:26.648
How are we going to stop her?

26:28.082 --> 26:29.348
I did have one idea.

26:30.415 --> 26:31.315
Medusa.

26:31.348 --> 26:33.048
She works in the palace

26:33.082 --> 26:34.748
and we need
someone to retrieve
the lock of hair.

26:34.782 --> 26:37.015
Without it,
the Queen has
no power over you.

26:37.048 --> 26:38.715
And if she's caught?

26:38.748 --> 26:41.415
I will not
involve her in this.
I will not risk her life.

26:41.448 --> 26:43.648
Then we will
more than likely die here

26:43.682 --> 26:45.415
and you will
never see her again.

26:47.148 --> 26:50.315
How would we even
get word to Medusa?
We're prisoners.

26:50.348 --> 26:52.648

-You're not going to like it.
-I didn't like the first one.

this one even less.

27:01.515 --> 27:04.448
Oh, no. You cannot
ask me to do this.

27:04.482 --> 27:05.782
There must be another way.

27:05.815 --> 27:07.622
If you can think of one,
we'll gladly listen to it.

27:07.655 --> 27:10.355
And we face the bull tomorrow,
so you must think of it
before then.

Once again it falls to me
to rescue you.

think such a thing?

with Maia,
the baker's daughter.

dwell on the past.

to take you into my arms,

of the dance,

41:50.878 --> 41:53.545
I fear his life would be
in great danger.

41:54.845 --> 41:57.545
You must banish
all thoughts of him.

41:57.578 --> 41:59.578
I do not wish
to endanger him
any further.

42:01.845 --> 42:03.878
I know you think me harsh,

42:04.345 --> 42:06.618
but as Queen,

42:08.151 --> 42:10.618
you cannot always
follow your heart.

42:11.551 --> 42:13.751
Then you are well-suited
to the role.

42:28.885 --> 42:32.785
It is only a matter of yards,
but the air somehow
feels fresher.

42:32.818 --> 42:35.051
It is the taste of freedom.

42:35.085 --> 42:36.351
What will you do?

42:36.385 --> 42:38.351
I will journey with Elpis
to her village.

42:38.385 --> 42:40.785
And then I will make
the long journey home.

42:40.818 --> 42:42.651
Good luck.

42:42.685 --> 42:46.118
You will always be welcomed
as honoured guests
in my village.

42:46.151 --> 42:47.818
I will never forget
what you did for us.

42:51.318 --> 42:55.539
Well, there can be no doubting
Medusa's feelings
towards me now.

42:55.572 --> 42:57.405
Why else would
she have helped me?

42:57.439 --> 42:59.405
It's a mark of
her growing affection.

42:59.439 --> 43:00.772
JASON: I still say
she's too young for you.

43:00.805 --> 43:02.839
PYTHAGORAS:
Not to mention too slim.

43:02.872 --> 43:05.405
HERCULES:
Perhaps I could
lose some weight.

43:17.179 --> 43:18.412
It's a baby.

43:19.879 --> 43:22.679
We've found out
who the little fellow is.
It's not good news.

43:28.612 --> 43:29.745
(BABY CRYING)

43:29.779 --> 43:31.379
-What are you doing to my boy?
