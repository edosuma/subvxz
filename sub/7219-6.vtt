00:01.035 --> 00:03.275
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.337 --> 00:04.372
What's he doing here?

00:04.471 --> 00:05.814
I'm checking on the child's welfare.

00:05.873 --> 00:06.851
How you doing, Kendal?

00:06.939 --> 00:08.351
This family needs to stay together.

00:08.442 --> 00:12.356
To wit, you need to find
a fit place for that boy to lay his head.

00:12.446 --> 00:15.120
A man that just talks is no man.

00:15.482 --> 00:18.224
That's not the way
you should be talking to me, homie.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.396
Oh, my God. You killed him.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.236
Ain't gonna tell nobody?

00:28.195 --> 00:29.196
I won't say a word.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.866
You turn over my cousin Johnny

00:30.964 --> 00:32.910
and you agree right now

00:33.000 --> 00:35.378
to help me smuggle heroin
across the border from Mexico.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.348
You know
what kind of deep shit you'd be in...

00:39.473 --> 00:41.146
...if you did...

00:41.408 --> 00:42.409
This?

00:42.509 --> 00:43.647
Oh, my God.

00:46.146 --> 00:47.216
Bye-bye, honey.

00:47.314 --> 00:48.816
She shanked the guard!

00:49.149 --> 00:53.063
You know, there's a rumour going around
that a federal lawman was instrumental

00:53.153 --> 00:54.826
in the death of Nicky Augustine.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.835
Picker said he was there on the tarmac,
watched the whole thing go down.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.233
Want to guess who he said it was?

00:59.560 --> 01:00.937
Special Agent Barkley.

01:02.496 --> 01:06.501
It wasn't Barkley,
and I can tell you that for a fact.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.096
Art.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.880
Damn, son, you always were a size!

04:30.203 --> 04:32.114
I'll never forget the day
you stepped off that bus

04:32.205 --> 04:34.048
at Elkton, gills out to here.

04:34.474 --> 04:37.318
I said, "Now, that right there
is a fish we can turn into a shark!"

04:37.410 --> 04:38.821
Yeah, reminding me that I owe you.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.789
Well, I don't think
you would need reminding.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.625
Now, how long you gonna
make me stand here

04:42.716 --> 04:43.990
before you offer me a drink?

04:45.051 --> 04:47.554
You know I know
you were the one that taught me how to jail.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.622
Everything!

04:48.722 --> 04:51.134
Helped free myself from mongrelisation.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.098
Actually, from what I hear,

04:54.161 --> 04:57.108
you could use
a little refresher on that your own self.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.643
Yeah? How's that?

04:59.065 --> 05:01.511
You really start a church
that lets in coloureds?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.804
Well, I believe I also taught you

05:03.904 --> 05:06.441
never let politics stand
in the way of business.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.581
What kind of business you and I got?

05:11.144 --> 05:16.150
Well, you had a sister,
as I recall, up in Pine Point.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.627
Actually, all three of my sisters
done a stretch up in there.

05:18.685 --> 05:20.631
But one of them is still in.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.633
Gretchen. You know, an attitude like her's,

05:23.690 --> 05:26.466
it's gonna be awhile before she takes
a walk in a yard without a fence.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.665
Now, actually,
I got a call from Gretchen this very morning.

05:31.264 --> 05:34.768
Said a girl with the last name Crowder
got busted in there for some

05:34.835 --> 05:36.872
set-to in Harlan lock-up.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.216
I guess that ain't no coincidence.

05:39.306 --> 05:40.876
Why, no, it is not.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.682
Gunnar Swift,
I don't remember you being this sly.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.950
Well, you're the one that taught me.

05:46.479 --> 05:47.958
Brawn's not enough.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.552
Neanderthals were so strong,
their muscles would bend their bones.

05:51.651 --> 05:54.791
You see a Neanderthal
walking around with a cellphone?

05:57.958 --> 05:59.403
Who's the girl?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.037
As far as I recall, you don't have a sister.

06:02.329 --> 06:05.902
Well, for simplicity's sake,
let's just call her my wife.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.873
Congratulations.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.846
And you want Gretchen to see
that's she's looked after, huh?

06:13.139 --> 06:15.380
- For how long?
- As long as it takes.

06:16.309 --> 06:20.155
Well, Gretchen's gonna need
a little money for her commissary.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.360
Well, this should keep her in tuna
and Kool-Aid for a little while.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.243
Are you Kendal's social worker?

06:49.342 --> 06:51.720
We're not supposed to enter the house

06:51.778 --> 06:53.018
if there's a dog on the loose.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.615
Danny, come get your animal!

06:55.115 --> 06:57.254
Most times, they bark
so they ain't got to bite.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.193
Yeah. It's just...

06:59.686 --> 07:00.721
Chelsea!

07:00.787 --> 07:02.960
It's more a liability thing than anything.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.798
When there's a dog living in the home,
technically, we're required...

07:05.892 --> 07:07.599
Dog don't live in the home.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.230
Dog lives outside.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.071
Yeah, don't mind Chelsea.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.874
He just gets excited when
he smells something he likes.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.778
Are Kendal and Wendy here?

07:16.870 --> 07:19.441
No, they ain't here. They at the store.

07:19.539 --> 07:20.950
We didn't expect you till later.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.885
Yeah, the drive was faster than I thought.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.049
All right. Well, come on in.
Don't be a jitterbug.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.422
Danny gonna put the dog outside.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.593
Go on. Put the dog outside, man!

07:32.052 --> 07:33.725
Let that dog shit.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.898
I'll get acquainted with you later.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.406
Little help here!

07:42.462 --> 07:43.736
Hey!

07:44.097 --> 07:45.474
Anybody!

07:47.567 --> 07:49.274
- Hi!
- Hi.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.679
Wanted to have
some hors d'oeuvres out for you,

07:50.770 --> 07:53.683
show you this is
a nice, hospitable, Christian home.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.915
I know. I'm... I'm early.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.687
Couldn't wail to see me again, huh?

07:57.777 --> 07:59.279
That's enough, Romeo.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.587
Head on up to your room.
Do your homework.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.525
Let Ms Brander do her job.

08:03.616 --> 08:06.756
Talking to me is her job. I mean,
who else's wellness is she here to check on?

08:06.820 --> 08:10.097
Well, actually,
she's not allowed to speak to you directly

08:10.156 --> 08:13.694
unless she has a warrant or some sort of
exigent circumstance. Isn't that right?

08:13.793 --> 08:15.466
Actually, it's a little more
complicated than that.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.667
Go on up 10 your room.

08:17.764 --> 08:20.108
When you done, I'll come up there.
We throw some bones.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.207
- So...
Dominoes.

08:22.802 --> 08:24.338
Darryl give you the tour?

08:24.437 --> 08:25.507
What's the verdict?

08:25.605 --> 08:28.279
This place fit for human habitation?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.649
What happened to Miami?

08:30.276 --> 08:32.517
Well, I decided my place there's too small.

08:32.611 --> 08:35.320
A teenage boy takes up some space.

08:35.381 --> 08:37.692
This place has a lot of that.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.626
Do you happen to have
the rental agreement for the home?

08:39.686 --> 08:42.565
Yeah, of course. I'll go get that for you.

08:45.892 --> 08:48.532
Say, how long
have you been going with that marshal?

08:51.297 --> 08:53.208
- What makes you think...
- Stop.

08:53.299 --> 08:55.472
I have an eye for that son of thing.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.809
Of course, if you ask me,

08:56.870 --> 09:00.044
I think he's about the most judgemental
asshole I ever hope to meet,

09:00.140 --> 09:02.211
but I will allow he's easy to look at.

09:02.308 --> 09:03.719
Of course, you put those things together,

09:03.810 --> 09:05.312
you probably got the perfect recipe for a man

09:05.378 --> 09:07.358
just about guaranteed to break your heart.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.551
I have an eye for that sort of thing, too.

09:09.649 --> 09:10.684
There you go.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.559
I made an extra copy for you, special.

09:12.652 --> 09:13.687
Thank you.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.070
That's good, Chelsea. It's good, Chelsea.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.370
Yeah. Yeah.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.412
Leaving so soon, Miss Alison?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.207
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.271
Play with Chelsea?

09:31.938 --> 09:33.178
Want to pull on the rope?

09:33.239 --> 09:35.014
Yeah, yeah! Come on!

09:36.342 --> 09:37.377
Yeah!

09:40.680 --> 09:41.852
Yeah.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.256
Don't you run. Yeah?

09:45.351 --> 09:47.763
Chelsea will chase you if you run.

09:53.693 --> 09:54.865
Don't you run.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.016
Anything else?

11:19.112 --> 11:22.184
I hear Theo's refusing to talk at all.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.387
Wouldn't even
tell the doctors his blood type.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.657
Of course not. He's got integrity.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.630
Plus, problem with being
top of the food chain is

11:28.688 --> 11:30.531
you can't dime out the guys above you.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.035
I mean, we already got bin Laden.

11:33.793 --> 11:36.330
Okay, are we seriously
not gonna talk about it?

11:36.396 --> 11:38.171
Talk about what, your bin Laden joke?

11:38.231 --> 11:39.369
Not your best.

11:39.465 --> 11:40.739
Raylan's eye.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.316
What, did you slip in Art's shower?

11:45.738 --> 11:47.547
Remember?
'Cause that's how Art hurl his hand.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.313
That bullet-counting thing.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.322
What, the inventory?

11:52.979 --> 11:54.253
I'll do it.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.223
Thank you, Raylan. I appreciate that.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.389
I'll help.
You said they wanted it ASAP, right?

12:00.486 --> 12:01.521
Yep.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.330
We ought to come up with a good excuse.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.604
People see us going into storage together,
might get some funny ideas.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.372
Why wouldn't we just tell them the truth?

12:14.434 --> 12:16.038
That we volunteered for inventory?

12:17.003 --> 12:18.880
Okay, yeah. We need an excuse.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.249
Before you say anything...

12:25.178 --> 12:26.521
What the hell happened to your face?

12:26.579 --> 12:28.024
You first.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.427
JB, where you an, man?

12:36.522 --> 12:39.867
Getting a little concerned. Call me back, man.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.606
Maybe he shacked up
with one of them hookers.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.698
- Yeah.
- Want to check the trailers?

12:46.866 --> 12:49.107
You sure you ain't heard from him?

12:49.202 --> 12:50.647
Not a word.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.044
Nothing, huh?

12:53.106 --> 12:55.211
It ain't like him to go MIA.

12:55.475 --> 12:59.048
Yeah, well, a lot of hillbillies around here.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.455
You know?

13:00.546 --> 13:02.651
Maybe he's swinging from a tree.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.456
Bullshit, man.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.723
Ain't none of them up to task.

13:10.657 --> 13:14.400
Don't suppose
you got any ideas where Baptiste is, huh?

13:17.563 --> 13:18.598
No.

13:18.665 --> 13:21.441
Hold up. You sure
there ain't something you ain't telling me?

13:24.237 --> 13:26.239
'Cause if there is, you best spill.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.477
- Darryl, I mean...
- But I asked you.

13:29.575 --> 13:30.645
You ain't have nothing to say.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.019
- Well, I didn't want to cause any trouble.
- About what?

13:33.112 --> 13:35.956
Well, I'll tell you. Look, Baptiste... He was...

13:36.015 --> 13:37.619
He was talking a lot of shit about you.

13:37.984 --> 13:41.659
- Saying what?
- You know, that... You know you...

13:41.754 --> 13:43.791
He didn't... He didn't have enough money

13:43.856 --> 13:45.961
- and that you couldn't provide.
- Provide?

13:46.025 --> 13:47.936
And I told him...
That's exactly what I told him.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.975
I said, "Listen, here, darkness. Okay?"

13:51.264 --> 13:56.304
"You ever talk
about my brother like that again, I'll cut you."

13:57.603 --> 14:00.482
Yeah, and then he said,
you know, he should have stayed in Florida,

14:00.540 --> 14:03.111
and I said,
"Well, get your dumb ass back to Florida."

14:03.676 --> 14:06.782
And he said, "Maybe I would."

14:08.281 --> 14:09.453
Just like that.

14:10.783 --> 14:13.161
You heard him talking shit like that?

14:13.219 --> 14:15.495
Yeah. Just like Danny said.

14:16.322 --> 14:17.665
Now, if he had a problem,

14:17.724 --> 14:20.534
why his bitch ass
didn't come and say something to me?

14:20.626 --> 14:22.367
He's... He's a pussy, you know.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.032
He probably didn't want to be talked out of it.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.406
Come on, you dumb bitch!
Give me a free one.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.001
Go on and deal with that, man!

14:28.067 --> 14:30.308
- Hey!
- Stop that woman!

14:30.536 --> 14:32.345
- Hey! Come here!
- I didn't do nothing.

14:35.808 --> 14:36.843
She gonna be all right?

14:36.909 --> 14:38.320
She'll be fine.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.550
Why didn't she call the cops?

14:39.645 --> 14:42.091
Guessing 'cause
she was worried they'd give her a field test.

14:42.181 --> 14:43.683
Booze? Pot?

14:44.984 --> 14:46.554
Wow, she just keeps getting better.

14:47.253 --> 14:48.561
How come you pushed basement?

14:48.654 --> 14:49.758
That's where you count bullets.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.028
Please. I'm going with you.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.526
Where am I going?

14:52.592 --> 14:54.833
You're going down to Harlan
to kick Danny Crowe's ass.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.872
Fine. You can drive.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.738
How long you have it?

15:03.836 --> 15:05.440
Not long enough.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.118
Why are you getting rid of it?

15:09.675 --> 15:11.120
Hitting the road.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.951
I need some travelling money.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.860
All right! I'll take it.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.262
Let's load her up!

15:24.524 --> 15:25.867
Wait.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.702
The hell's that?

15:29.862 --> 15:32.103
That there's the minor cosmetic damage.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.603
- I put it on the sign.
- Cosmetic?

15:34.700 --> 15:37.112
This thing is blown to shit!

15:37.870 --> 15:39.872
It ain't no pool! It's junk!

15:39.939 --> 15:42.283
$800, my ass.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.820
How much you want to give me, then?

15:45.578 --> 15:48.058
Give you 20 bucks,
take it straight to the scrap yard.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.116
How far am I supposed to get on 20 bucks?

15:50.216 --> 15:51.820
I paid $1,000 for this thing!

15:51.918 --> 15:54.296
Yeah, well, when you did, it held water!

15:54.387 --> 15:55.764
20 bucks, final offer.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.593
This here pool was my dream.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.729
I ain't selling it for no 20 bucks!

16:00.793 --> 16:02.602
Then I ain't wasting no more time.

16:03.729 --> 16:04.764
Shit!

16:05.998 --> 16:07.978
In fact, I ain't gonna sell it at all!

16:08.401 --> 16:10.347
I ain't giving up on my dream!

16:11.904 --> 16:13.508
I ain't giving up on my dream!

16:19.245 --> 16:21.088
Danny! What the hell happened?

16:21.147 --> 16:22.353
What's it matter?

16:22.448 --> 16:26.294
Guys around here think buying a drink
buys them a license to talk shit.

16:26.352 --> 16:27.456
Now, which one's his?

16:28.454 --> 16:30.297
It's that one there, I believe.

16:30.356 --> 16:31.699
Oh, God.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.169
This whole place is ass-backwards, Dewey.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.500
You know that?

16:35.595 --> 16:36.801
How you doing, sweetheart?

16:36.863 --> 16:39.537
Yeah, God damn it,
I was having a good hair day.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.543
Can I ask you something, Danny?

16:42.602 --> 16:45.549
If I get Darryl the money
I paid Boyd for Audry's,

16:45.638 --> 16:47.345
do you really think he'd leave Kentucky?

16:48.207 --> 16:51.154
Well, you produce that type of cash,

16:51.210 --> 16:53.053
we'd all like to cut this shit hole loose.

16:53.646 --> 16:54.989
Hey.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.888
Go 10 sleep, ginger.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.067
I see your wheels turning there, cousin.

17:06.058 --> 17:09.061
Need I remind you, we leaned pretty hard
on Crowder ourselves

17:09.161 --> 17:10.367
and he didn't budge.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.806
I know.

17:13.232 --> 17:15.075
So, what's your idea?

17:16.301 --> 17:19.044
We grab him, put a gun 10 his head,

17:19.137 --> 17:21.880
tell him to hand over the money
or he's a dead man.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.382
You're a goddamn genius. You know that?

17:42.395 --> 17:43.840
When do I get to see Boyd?

17:44.397 --> 17:45.535
First things first.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.600
I'm having you released into gen pop.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.680
Boyd lined someone up to watch your back.

17:49.735 --> 17:50.941
Why does my back need watching?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.679
You're young. You're pretty.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.186
You shivved a guard. So the officers...

17:56.242 --> 17:57.880
I didn't do that.

17:59.378 --> 18:00.618
You know that, right?

18:01.414 --> 18:04.361
Look, I know that you and Boyd paid me

18:04.417 --> 18:06.124
to stick headphones in my ears,

18:06.218 --> 18:08.198
but I assure you, lam a good lawyer.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.756
You got a line on the officer?

18:09.855 --> 18:11.425
He went to ground. Nobody knows where.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.526
Might have relatives out of state.
We're looking into that.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.437
The way he was,
he must've tried to screw others before me.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.031
We're looking into that, too.

18:18.397 --> 18:21.776
You looking into
security cameras showing that I didn't do it?

18:22.134 --> 18:24.239
All the ones in that area were turned off.

18:35.481 --> 18:37.324
Boyd send a message at least?

18:37.883 --> 18:38.953
He did.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.078
Can you help me?

19:11.283 --> 19:12.421
We're closed!

19:23.596 --> 19:24.597
Well,

19:25.698 --> 19:28.770
I must say' you're about
the last person I'd expect to walk in here.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.279
Where's Boyd?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.942
Why? You want to apologise?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.177
For what?

19:34.273 --> 19:36.514
Sending your idiot cousin over here
to try and shake us down.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.644
I didn't send him.

19:37.710 --> 19:41.123
Did you really think
you could muscle Boyd Crowder?

19:41.847 --> 19:45.351
All I think is,
you don't know the things I done.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.291
You hear what happened to Messer?

19:47.353 --> 19:48.491
- I ain't Messer.
- Hey.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.363
Easy up there, partner.

19:50.456 --> 19:53.130
Hey. Look right here. How you doing?

19:53.793 --> 19:55.704
Why don't you
just tell us where the big boss man is?

19:55.795 --> 19:57.365
Don't suppose you're Darryl Jr., huh?

19:58.330 --> 20:00.867
'Cause I heard he was a big son of a bitch.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.807
I'm plenty big enough for you.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.648
Think so?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.142
Yeah.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.158
You get that out of a cereal box?

20:15.581 --> 20:16.855
I told you.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.226
You got no idea what I'm capable of.

20:19.318 --> 20:20.695
Now tell us where Boyd is.

20:22.488 --> 20:25.059
You're about to
step off a mighty high ledge, Dewey.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.000
Don't you worry, 'cause I'll catch him.

20:27.359 --> 20:28.770
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.231
Well, who's gonna catch you?

20:49.448 --> 20:51.359
What the hell are we supposed to do now?

20:55.254 --> 20:56.528
Plan "B".

20:57.356 --> 20:59.393
What the hell is plan "B"?

21:00.726 --> 21:03.866
We see how much
Boyd's gonna pay for his guy.

21:21.547 --> 21:23.549
Berta, my man.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.496
- Been a long time.
- Yes, it has.

21:30.456 --> 21:33.733
Wynn Duffy, Boyd Crowder,
this is Alberto Ruiz.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.168
And you must be Mr Yoon.

21:38.764 --> 21:40.402
And how do you know that?

21:40.466 --> 21:42.275
The one wonton among the tortillas?

21:42.735 --> 21:45.272
I would have said "kimchi in the salsa".

21:45.671 --> 21:47.082
That was good.

21:47.573 --> 21:49.985
See, the Aenikkaeng were slaves from Korea

21:50.075 --> 21:52.453
brought over to Mexico
to work in plantations.

21:52.511 --> 21:53.785
I know.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.315
I've read a lot of books about slavery.

21:56.415 --> 21:57.621
He's a history buff.

21:58.517 --> 22:00.155
And some people think
that I would be offended

22:00.252 --> 22:02.129
if you point out the incongruity.

22:02.488 --> 22:05.298
Well, I assume you want it pointed out.

22:05.357 --> 22:06.427
And why would I want that?

22:06.492 --> 22:09.336
Because it suggests
you're very good at what you do.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.672
I think Mr Picker told you
we require payment up front.

22:15.768 --> 22:16.940
He did.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.846
But we were hoping
to come to a different understanding.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.145
The hell is this, Boyd?

22:21.207 --> 22:22.345
I gave these guys my word.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.546
We've had some bad experiences lately

22:24.643 --> 22:27.214
with the pay-up-front business model.

22:32.184 --> 22:35.028
Well, fortunately, the people I represent

22:35.120 --> 22:38.863
rely on me precisely because
they know I'm not like them.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.361
I dislike beheadings, gentleman.

22:41.460 --> 22:43.633
- So do we.
- It's bad for business.

22:44.663 --> 22:47.166
And the fact is, the money in that bag

22:47.233 --> 22:49.509
would only buy you insurance
against my employers

22:49.568 --> 22:51.172
feeling taken advantage of

22:51.237 --> 22:54.309
if anything should
go wrong in our transaction,

22:54.373 --> 22:55.818
so I'm willing to proceed without it.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.352
I do want to make sure
you understand that my employers

22:59.411 --> 23:04.156
would never let anything jeopardise
their reputation as men not to be crossed.

23:04.917 --> 23:08.831
And if, at any point,
their reputation needs to be re-established...

23:10.422 --> 23:11.765
It won't be me they send.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.328
Well, I assume we have a deal.

23:19.765 --> 23:21.039
Crowder!

23:26.572 --> 23:28.279
You're moving. Pack your shit.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.417
You wanted out of that cell?
Welcome to gen pop.

23:36.515 --> 23:37.687
Yeah.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.689
Yeah, pop, pop.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.271
Hey. I'm Ava.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.394
You're on top.

23:48.460 --> 23:51.703
You bring drugs in here,
leave your used maxis lying around,

23:51.764 --> 23:53.266
you and I will have a problem.

23:53.365 --> 23:56.073
Keep your area clean,
keep yourself clean in every way,

23:56.135 --> 23:57.307
and we should get along famously.

23:58.404 --> 24:00.611
Questions?
- No.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.585
I'm Nikki, by the way.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.116
Hi, Nikki.

24:06.912 --> 24:08.892
So, where's Crowder's guy now?

24:09.248 --> 24:10.784
He's in a trunk.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.385
Alive?

24:12.451 --> 24:13.725
Was when he went in.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.595
We're gonna ransom him back.

24:15.654 --> 24:16.928
For God's sake.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.265
Don't you know
you can't talk shit like that around me?

24:19.325 --> 24:20.736
Where's Darryl?

24:25.331 --> 24:27.277
- Jesus.
- How could they know already?

24:29.435 --> 24:30.743
Damn it.

24:31.570 --> 24:32.981
Hell you think you're doing?

24:33.072 --> 24:35.814
What? I ain't going away for 20 years.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.512
I got nothing to lose. I'm gonna take my shot.

24:37.609 --> 24:41.113
No, no, no, no. Danny.
We don't know yet why they're here.

24:41.580 --> 24:43.821
They can't open the trunk without a reason,

24:43.916 --> 24:47.523
same like they can't come in the house
without a reason. Right?

24:48.020 --> 24:50.330
So we're not gonna give them a reason.

24:50.422 --> 24:52.595
You got it? Now, you two stay here.

24:52.658 --> 24:56.435
Stay out of sight. I'll go handle the marshal.

24:57.796 --> 24:59.537
She's like nails on a chalkboard.

25:04.370 --> 25:05.781
Marshal!

25:05.838 --> 25:07.044
Surprised to see you here.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.482
Guess I could say the same,

25:08.540 --> 25:10.679
since I was led to believe
you just about swore

25:10.776 --> 25:12.153
you're taking the boy to Miami.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.122
So, to what do I owe the pleasure?

25:14.480 --> 25:15.550
Where's Danny?

25:16.115 --> 25:18.220
I haven't seen him since this morning? Why?

25:19.118 --> 25:22.531
Well, Kendal's social worker,
she left here last night.

25:22.621 --> 25:24.658
He followed her, ran her off the road.

25:24.723 --> 25:27.863
Now, I'm willing to concede
there's a chance he did it on his own.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.201
How about being
willing to concede he didn't do it at all?

25:30.295 --> 25:33.333
I guess he's just someone else
who decided to bark like a dog.

25:33.399 --> 25:35.675
I'm sorry. I don't think we've met.
My name is Wendy.

25:35.734 --> 25:36.838
Deputy Marshal Brooks.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.313
So, why would Danny bark?

25:40.372 --> 25:43.080
Well, your brother's a world-class dumb-ass.

25:43.175 --> 25:46.679
No offence. So I hesitate trying to analyse
what goes on in his head.

25:46.745 --> 25:48.224
But if I had to guess,

25:48.547 --> 25:51.153
I'd say it was his way of trying to call me out.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.727
Well, as I said, he's not here,

25:53.819 --> 25:55.560
but I'm happy to give him the message.

25:55.654 --> 25:57.031
Not here, huh?

25:57.322 --> 25:59.324
That's a lot of cars for just you.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.936
You got no cause to enter our house.

26:02.027 --> 26:04.439
Not your house. In fact, I know
the fellow who owns this place.

26:04.530 --> 26:07.033
You know what I mean.
Alison saw the rental agreement.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.237
Yeah, she told me.

26:08.333 --> 26:09.778
Deputy, unless you show me a warrant,

26:09.868 --> 26:11.575
you best not step through that door.

26:11.670 --> 26:14.412
You'd be surprised
where all a marshal can go without a warrant.

26:14.506 --> 26:16.213
If you're allowed to violate
the fourth amendment,

26:16.275 --> 26:17.447
I would be very surprised.

26:17.543 --> 26:19.682
If I suspect the man who owns this house

26:19.745 --> 26:22.351
is chained up in the basement or, worse...

26:22.414 --> 26:24.519
Given your family, cooking in a pot,

26:25.050 --> 26:26.961
I can go just about anywhere.

26:27.352 --> 26:28.592
You want to talk to Mike?

26:28.687 --> 26:31.293
Is that gonna assuage your dark imaginings?

26:31.390 --> 26:33.028
- Sure. Bring him out.
- He's not here.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.628
He's at his store.

27:16.335 --> 27:17.473
What's up?

27:20.105 --> 27:21.482
You got good timing.

27:21.573 --> 27:24.645
Just last night, it was raining like
an old cow pissing on a flat rock.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.921
I'm Penny. You're Ava, right?

27:28.247 --> 27:29.749
Word is, you almost killed a guard.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.327
Yeah, well, I didn't really do that.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.419
- Can I give you a piece of free advice?
- Sure.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.092
Next time someone asks,
don't say you didn't do it.

27:37.589 --> 27:38.693
So what am I supposed to say?

27:38.790 --> 27:40.497
"He wasn't the first. He won't be the last."

27:40.592 --> 27:42.094
Don't say anything.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.038
Half these bitches are snitches.

27:44.129 --> 27:47.042
And you don't want anyone
getting it in her mind to test you.

27:47.132 --> 27:50.636
Look, the best way to get by around here
is to be left alone.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.977
Yeah, well, I'm not sure that's up to me.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.385
Hey, Penny.

27:57.776 --> 27:59.983
Patrice. How you doing?

28:00.479 --> 28:04.154
Be better once you introduce me to
this little piece of white fish.

28:04.216 --> 28:07.493
Ava's no fish. She just got
transferred from the Harlan lock-up.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.563
I guess that means
you the one that shivved that hack, huh?

28:11.456 --> 28:13.458
What happened, he tried to get fresh?

28:13.859 --> 28:15.736
Guess it's hard to blame him.

28:17.563 --> 28:19.167
I do like that good hair.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.302
Shit, Patrice. You got issues.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.202
That's just white-girl hair.

28:23.635 --> 28:25.376
Look, I don't want any trouble.

28:25.470 --> 28:26.813
No trouble.

28:27.139 --> 28:30.552
Nichelle here just gets kind of militant
when it comes to some things.

28:30.876 --> 28:33.880
Me, I say
we all the same colour where it matters.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.372
Thank you.

28:53.432 --> 28:54.433
Excuse us.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.210
Ava, I'll see you around.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.608
I'm Gretchen Swift.

29:01.707 --> 29:04.517
Boyd paid my brother, Gunnar,
to see you looked after.

29:04.876 --> 29:05.946
Well, I...

29:12.251 --> 29:14.697
- Your man is a race traitor.
- Let go of me!

29:14.753 --> 29:17.700
Race traitors are the only thing I hate
more than these black bitches.

29:18.056 --> 29:19.364
You really do got nice hair.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.461
- No! Let go of me!
- You best stop moving, princess.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.473
You keep thrashing around, we might slice
something that won't grow back.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.034
Let go of me!

29:29.234 --> 29:30.440
Stop!

29:30.869 --> 29:32.143
Stop!

29:42.381 --> 29:45.453
Boy leaves my bar unattended,
I'm inclined to dock his pay.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.120
- Check in the back.
- Carl?

29:49.054 --> 29:50.124
Carl?

29:50.222 --> 29:51.394
Geist.

29:51.790 --> 29:55.499
Getting to be it makes me nervous
to see your name pop up on my cellphone.

29:58.997 --> 30:00.567
You know who did it?

30:03.135 --> 30:04.614
Carl ain't here.

30:05.937 --> 30:07.245
Boyd?

30:07.973 --> 30:09.509
Ava got jumped.

30:10.575 --> 30:12.316
I thought Gunners sister
is looking after her?

30:12.411 --> 30:14.186
Gunnar's sister is the one who did it.

30:20.085 --> 30:22.588
Jimmy, I'm gonna need you to run an errand.

30:24.690 --> 30:25.828
Thank you, young man.

30:25.924 --> 30:27.665
Ma'am. Nice day, now.

30:27.759 --> 30:29.033
You too.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.436
Shouldn't you be in school?

30:35.500 --> 30:36.774
It's a holiday.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.337
What holiday is that?

30:38.437 --> 30:40.849
I don't know. Some mopey, cultural bullshit.

30:40.939 --> 30:43.351
Greek New Year's, Chinese Easter.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.718
Guess it's better than the last place
I found you working.

30:45.811 --> 30:48.223
Getting paid to look at
half-naked girls all day?

30:48.814 --> 30:50.157
Yeah, I was miserable.

30:50.449 --> 30:51.860
We're looking for Mike.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.793
Who the hell is Mike?

30:56.788 --> 30:58.199
Fellow who owns this store,

30:58.523 --> 31:00.230
owns the house you're living in.

31:00.325 --> 31:03.204
You talking about Mr Dorn
or Thorn or whatever?

31:03.295 --> 31:04.638
Wendy didn't call to warn you?

31:04.996 --> 31:06.703
She said y'all was looking for Danny.

31:06.798 --> 31:08.368
Well, now we're looking for Mike.

31:08.467 --> 31:09.571
Where is he?

31:09.968 --> 31:11.174
Shit, I don't know.

31:11.236 --> 31:12.874
I guess he went out or something.

31:12.971 --> 31:14.712
What do you intend to do with that saw?

31:14.806 --> 31:17.377
You know. Saw things.

31:17.476 --> 31:21.686
Like, saw an old man's body apart
before you put it into a hole?

31:21.747 --> 31:22.748
No.

31:22.848 --> 31:26.261
Got yourself a dark, twisted mind,
don't you, Raylan?

31:27.085 --> 31:28.826
You ought to come with me.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.359
Keep an eye on the kid.

31:31.423 --> 31:34.529
You hear any shots, Kendal,
you know what to do.

31:37.863 --> 31:41.106
Hey, man. Someone's hereto see you.

31:41.199 --> 31:43.406
Hey, Raylan! What brings you down here?

31:43.502 --> 31:45.846
I went by your house.
There's a family living there.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.544
Yeah. New tenants. ls there a problem?

31:49.441 --> 31:50.613
Curious what they're doing there.

31:50.709 --> 31:54.851
Man, we just exchanging hard-earned
American dollars for a place to stay.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.859
Be quiet. Mike?

31:57.783 --> 32:02.425
Well, the nicest girl showed up at my door.
Redhead.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.764
Had her little brother with her,
the one working out at the counter.

32:05.857 --> 32:09.361
Claimed she had no money
and living out of a car.

32:10.195 --> 32:13.472
Couldn't call myself a Christian
if I didn't try to help.

32:13.565 --> 32:16.045
What about this one
and his brother, Danny, and that dog?

32:16.101 --> 32:17.603
They living in the car, too?

32:18.770 --> 32:21.410
Well, they just kind of showed up.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.952
I want you to tell them
you can't rent to them any more.

32:26.044 --> 32:27.546
Hold up, man! You can't do that!

32:27.612 --> 32:30.092
Be quiet, and I ain't gonna tell you again.

32:31.049 --> 32:33.893
Tell them they can't live in your house.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.091
Cabin, too?

32:36.154 --> 32:38.100
- What cabin?
- My hunting cabin.

32:39.057 --> 32:40.764
That was part of the deal.

32:50.235 --> 32:53.648
Gunnar is holed up with about
a half-dozen of his Hitler-humpers.

32:53.738 --> 32:56.912
Seems like they're
just waiting for us to circle back around.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.594
You know I'll follow you anywhere, Boyd.

33:13.191 --> 33:15.364
But it seems to me like
it won't pay to go straight at them

33:15.460 --> 33:17.804
when they're casting a shadow
this much bigger than ours.

33:19.931 --> 33:22.275
I'm gonna try one more time to raise Carl.

33:25.270 --> 33:28.683
Hey, stop embarrassing yourself,
chopping that wood like that.

33:28.773 --> 33:29.979
Yep.

33:35.113 --> 33:37.024
<i>Carl, where in the hell you been, man?
We got trouble.</i>

33:37.115 --> 33:38.788
Well, wouldn't you like to know.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.001
Carl. Carl!

33:47.959 --> 33:49.199
What?

33:49.861 --> 33:51.898
No! No, I'm not Carl!

33:54.065 --> 33:57.569
What the... Shit. God damn this thing!

33:59.037 --> 34:01.074
I think he said something about shoes.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.485
- Hello.
- Yes, so I was saying...

34:08.647 --> 34:09.887
No, I can't hear you.

34:10.815 --> 34:12.726
Boyd? Is that you?

34:13.418 --> 34:15.398
Now, I'm gonna give you 30 minutes

34:15.487 --> 34:18.366
to be where
you should have been 30 minutes ago.

34:22.226 --> 34:25.572
Boyd? Damn, this reception is for shit!

34:38.677 --> 34:40.020
Danny!

34:40.411 --> 34:41.857
Shit.

34:58.196 --> 35:00.073
You didn't tell me we was expecting guests.

35:00.131 --> 35:01.872
I would have cleaned up.

35:04.536 --> 35:05.879
Shut your mouth.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.118
Deputy.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.492
Your girl give you my message?

35:17.549 --> 35:19.324
Thing is, it's just not a good time, though.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.063
Well, let's make it a good time.

35:28.493 --> 35:31.133
Chelsea, sic 'em! Sic 'em, Chelsea!

35:31.563 --> 35:33.509
Just so you know, it comes to it,

35:33.598 --> 35:35.635
first one that takes a bullet is this dog.

35:36.901 --> 35:38.812
Chelsea! Quiet!

35:38.903 --> 35:40.678
Besides, beef for kidnapping...

35:40.772 --> 35:43.150
It got to be better
than dying up here in this cabin.

35:43.408 --> 35:44.853
Now, who said anything about kidnapping?

35:44.943 --> 35:46.149
Excuse me?

35:46.244 --> 35:48.190
Suppose he never kidnapped me, huh?

35:48.279 --> 35:50.953
Suppose I'm here of my own volition.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.018
Being that you're beat-up and tied to a chair?

35:54.653 --> 35:57.600
Well, Danny and I here,
we never did settle on a safe word, did we?

36:01.626 --> 36:03.105
Yeah.

36:04.295 --> 36:06.172
We share some things in common.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.373
I don't believe we've met.

36:11.036 --> 36:12.310
I'm Carl.

36:12.370 --> 36:15.351
And you're Raylan, right?

36:16.041 --> 36:17.543
We have a friend in common.

36:18.610 --> 36:19.816
Boyd Crowder.

36:20.045 --> 36:23.390
Little embarrassing,
you happening upon us in such a state.

36:23.481 --> 36:26.325
But, seeing as how
there's no criminally unbecoming activity

36:26.384 --> 36:28.386
currently going on,
let's say Danny here cuts me loose

36:28.486 --> 36:31.865
and we all just go on our way, huh?

36:33.158 --> 36:36.970
Meaning, you go loose,
then you go back to Boyd,

36:37.028 --> 36:39.565
and the two of you
settle up with Danny at your leisure.

36:39.798 --> 36:40.902
Something like that?

36:41.166 --> 36:43.168
Well, I'm not a fortune teller,

36:43.234 --> 36:45.145
so who can tell what the future holds?

36:45.570 --> 36:46.674
Well, look at that.

36:47.539 --> 36:50.145
I think we may have
come up with a peaceful resolution.

36:50.475 --> 36:53.388
Yeah, we have. Real peaceful.

37:01.553 --> 37:02.725
Hell, no!

37:02.821 --> 37:04.562
That's bullshit! I ain't going nowhere!

37:04.656 --> 37:06.067
Darryl, you know I've been on board

37:06.157 --> 37:07.431
with this whole
"trying to start a life here" thing.

37:07.525 --> 37:08.560
You ain't trying to do nothing!

37:08.660 --> 37:10.230
You're trying to go back to Miami, right?

37:10.328 --> 37:13.241
We have got to face the facts!
The house is gone.

37:13.331 --> 37:15.208
Danny's probably on his way to jail
as we speak.

37:15.266 --> 37:16.711
Let's just cut our losses now and go

37:16.768 --> 37:18.714
before that marshal grabs Kendal again.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.545
Kentucky is over for us, Darryl.

37:20.605 --> 37:21.913
The only one doesn't
seem to know that is you.

37:22.006 --> 37:23.576
I mean, why do you think Jean Baptiste

37:23.675 --> 37:26.019
- stole outwith the night.
- Man, forget him! All right, he's soft!

37:26.077 --> 37:27.750
No, he could see the writing on the wall.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.757
Wendy, I ain't going nowhere!

37:29.848 --> 37:33.193
You hear me? I've been busting my ass
trying to keep this family together.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.389
What, and I haven't been?

37:34.452 --> 37:37.023
If it wasn't for me,
Kendal would be in a foster home right now.

37:38.690 --> 37:39.794
Shit, Danny.

37:41.359 --> 37:42.599
Marshals did that to you?

37:43.294 --> 37:45.035
How do you guys know about the marshals?

37:45.430 --> 37:47.205
- He told me.
- Yeah, I went to get help,

37:47.265 --> 37:48.539
but I got lost in the woods.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.443
They got Crowder's guy, also?

37:50.535 --> 37:52.811
Yeah. Yeah. It's all right.

37:52.904 --> 37:56.442
Yeah.
Carl said that he ain't gonna press charges.

37:56.541 --> 37:58.919
He said we were up there
doing some sex thing.

37:59.310 --> 38:02.223
And it was... It was...

38:02.981 --> 38:05.723
It was consexual.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.290
Man, that's good for the law,

38:07.385 --> 38:08.955
but what you think
Crowder's gonna do, huh?

38:09.454 --> 38:11.229
You almost started a war, man.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.632
You a problem, man! You know that?

38:12.724 --> 38:14.670
Yeah, why you have to
run that lady off the road?

38:14.759 --> 38:16.295
- Here we go. You gonna blame it on me?
- Yeah, I'm...

38:16.394 --> 38:18.135
- Is that it? You gonna blame it on me?
- Yeah, I'm blaming...

38:18.229 --> 38:19.435
- Hey! Stop it!
- You gonna blame it on me?

38:19.497 --> 38:22.944
Family and dysfunction
go together like peanut butter and chocolate.

38:23.234 --> 38:26.681
I come in peace. Him, not so much.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.477
What you want?

38:28.573 --> 38:30.814
I just figured it's time we had a chat.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.320
Try to de-escalate.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.481
Well, it don't matter no more, Boyd.
They're leaving.

38:34.579 --> 38:37.321
Well, I hate to hear that,
because I was thinking

38:37.415 --> 38:39.258
we might be
the answer to each others prayers.

38:39.684 --> 38:41.163
Is that right?

38:41.252 --> 38:42.959
You gonna give me that money
I talked to you about?

38:43.021 --> 38:45.433
Oh, no. But, because I believe in capitalism,

38:45.490 --> 38:47.993
I'll give you an opportunity to earn some.

38:48.092 --> 38:50.038
I've got a job that needs doing.

38:50.128 --> 38:51.334
Don't trust him, cousin Darryl.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.500
He's gonna screw you over like he did to me.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.771
Shut up, Dewey, and sit down.

38:56.634 --> 38:57.669
As I was saying...

38:57.769 --> 38:59.214
- What's the job?
- What's the job?

39:07.846 --> 39:09.291
I warned you

39:10.215 --> 39:12.195
Gretchen had a bad attitude.

39:12.550 --> 39:15.463
Now, you know
race treason is a serious crime, Boyd.

39:15.720 --> 39:16.790
Needed paying for.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.495
Well, then, I guess I'm here for my refund.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.804
You always had a pair of balls on you, Boyd.

39:23.127 --> 39:25.971
But walking in here, all alone?

39:26.531 --> 39:28.909
Hell, you couldn't take me one-on-one.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.846
You gonna take on one-on-six?

39:33.671 --> 39:36.242
One lesson you could never understand is

39:36.341 --> 39:39.811
"Why make an enemy
when you can make a friend?"

39:40.144 --> 39:43.990
Now, I want you
to meet my new friend, Darryl Crowe, Jr.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.022
Come on, Darryl!

39:46.651 --> 39:48.062
Nail him!

39:49.254 --> 39:51.734
Come on, Darryl! Get him good!

39:52.223 --> 39:55.102
Get him, Darryl! Come on, boy! Get him, boy!

39:56.027 --> 39:57.506
Yeah, get him good!

40:03.368 --> 40:04.779
Come on, Darryl!

40:04.869 --> 40:06.075
That's good.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.588
Now, Gunnar,
I know it's gonna be real unpleasant

40:18.683 --> 40:20.185
for you to talk for a little while.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.288
But you need to let your sister know

40:22.387 --> 40:26.597
that if anything else happens to my woman,

40:26.691 --> 40:28.967
if she cuts her leg shaving,

40:29.527 --> 40:32.030
I'm gonna take it out on you a hundredfold.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.440
Now, Carl, gel my goddamn money.

41:09.767 --> 41:10.837
Nikki.

41:10.935 --> 41:12.414
What the hell?

41:12.937 --> 41:14.075
I need your razor.

41:14.405 --> 41:15.679
What razor?

41:16.174 --> 41:17.585
The one you have in your mattress.

41:20.278 --> 41:21.848
You going after Gretchen?

41:22.246 --> 41:23.589
That's crazy.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.465
I just need it for a second.

41:31.022 --> 41:33.024
I'll give you commissary for a week.

41:33.458 --> 41:34.493
A month.

41:35.760 --> 41:36.966
Fine.

41:47.271 --> 41:49.046
You get caught with this,
you're on your own.

42:22.974 --> 42:25.921
Mr Dunham!
You're a hard man to get a hold of.

42:26.010 --> 42:27.250
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

42:27.345 --> 42:28.915
<i>Been a little busy down here lately.</i>

42:29.080 --> 42:31.151
Is that all? I was starting to worry

42:31.215 --> 42:33.217
you'd rethought
some of the bullet points of our deal.

42:33.317 --> 42:35.593
No, it ain't nothing like that.

42:35.686 --> 42:39.600
I got my boys
scooping up your cousin as we speak.

42:40.258 --> 42:43.034
<i>Well, in that case, no apologies necessary.</i>

42:43.761 --> 42:46.071
<i>You thought about how
you want to deliver him?</i>

42:46.164 --> 42:50.874
I figure we'd bring him down with us when
we meet you in Nuevo Laredo.

42:50.935 --> 42:53.415
You can have your time with him there

42:53.504 --> 42:56.280
and bury him in the desert
before we cross back over.

42:56.374 --> 42:59.287
Well, I look forward lo hanging up my piñata.

42:59.377 --> 43:01.414
Now, Rodney, it's important

43:01.512 --> 43:04.015
that our business down there
goes nice and smooth.

43:04.749 --> 43:08.697
<i>The people we're dealing with don't strike me
as the type that go in for drama.</i>

43:10.388 --> 43:13.028
You remember that day
in the Bennetts' barn?

43:13.091 --> 43:15.867
You and me was buying weed from Dickie?

43:17.228 --> 43:19.037
<i>Be just that smooth.</i>

43:20.064 --> 43:22.203
Well, that's good to hear.

43:22.733 --> 43:25.145
I'll see you the day after tomorrow in Mexico.

43:25.236 --> 43:27.944
Don't forget to pack your sunscreen.

43:33.044 --> 43:34.284
So, what did he say?

43:34.378 --> 43:37.222
He said it would go as smooth as
the last time we did business together.

43:37.882 --> 43:39.054
That's good, right?

43:39.884 --> 43:42.888
Last time we did business together,
I robbed him.

43:56.501 --> 43:59.846
You wanted to
kick Danny Crowds ass, though, right?

44:00.404 --> 44:03.578
Well, there's a certain satisfaction
seeing you pop him in the nose.

44:05.943 --> 44:07.581
Feeling cheated it wasn't you?

44:08.346 --> 44:10.690
- You mean, you feel cheated?
- Me?

44:11.115 --> 44:12.651
I'm glad it went how it went.

44:12.750 --> 44:13.854
Is that a fact?

44:14.785 --> 44:16.162
What are you implying?

44:16.821 --> 44:20.291
You wanted me to come off the leash
so you could call me to heel.

44:21.192 --> 44:23.138
That's why you came along, right?

44:23.194 --> 44:26.175
Report back to the boss
that the chronic-problem deputy

44:26.264 --> 44:28.437
was kept in check by the office kiss-ass?

44:29.934 --> 44:32.437
You might see it that way.

44:33.204 --> 44:35.047
If you were a son of a bitch.

44:36.774 --> 44:39.015
The other way you could see it is that,

44:39.110 --> 44:40.987
after all we've been through,

44:41.479 --> 44:43.288
the trust we've built,

44:43.881 --> 44:46.020
I came with you in case

44:46.951 --> 44:49.363
you opened up a crack
and wanted to talk about

44:49.453 --> 44:52.024
how bad you could have messed up that

44:52.123 --> 44:55.332
Art has a swole fist and you got a black eye.

45:06.470 --> 45:09.508
You're not a kiss-ass. I'm sorry I said that.

45:11.542 --> 45:14.751
You know I think the world of you,
and I trust you with my life.

45:14.845 --> 45:16.017
But, Rachel,

45:16.514 --> 45:20.326
I ain't saying a goddamn thing
about me and Art.

45:23.154 --> 45:24.895
'Cause if you did,
it would drive the whole office

45:24.989 --> 45:28.493
into a shit storm of biblical proportion.
Isn't that right?

45:37.001 --> 45:40.175
I asked you
not to go down there and stir the pot.

45:41.172 --> 45:43.083
If anything' I just sniffed the pot.

45:43.174 --> 45:44.448
Got a sense of what's cooking.

45:44.709 --> 45:48.589
To tell you the truth, I didn't have to kick
Danny Crowe's ass on your behalf.

45:48.679 --> 45:51.421
Those animals are gonna
rip each other apart soon enough.

45:52.583 --> 45:54.358
Well, steer clear if that's the case.

45:56.120 --> 45:57.622
You wanted to.

45:57.722 --> 45:59.395
It bugs you that you didn't.

46:00.258 --> 46:01.601
Kick his ass?

46:03.127 --> 46:05.198
Would have had a certain satisfaction.

46:05.463 --> 46:09.138
Is that who you are, Raylan?
An old-time American hero?

46:09.233 --> 46:11.213
Just a guy that does a job.

46:11.269 --> 46:13.715
Tough job'
fist-fighting bad guys all day long.

46:18.209 --> 46:20.120
I got this from my chief.

46:21.078 --> 46:22.455
Long story,

46:22.546 --> 46:24.583
gist of which is I'm no hero.

46:25.116 --> 46:26.720
Well, then, who are you?

46:27.585 --> 46:28.791
What?

46:29.153 --> 46:31.155
Who are you, really?

46:32.890 --> 46:35.268
The guy whose chief
punches him in the eye?

46:35.626 --> 46:38.505
That runs off to defend the honour of a lady?

46:39.063 --> 46:41.065
A guy that has a lady and the ex

46:41.132 --> 46:43.237
and the baby daughter
all stashed out of state?

46:44.101 --> 46:46.308
I guess so. What's your point?

46:46.404 --> 46:47.644
You are a hero, Raylan.

46:47.738 --> 46:49.911
I met enough LEOs to know.

46:51.742 --> 46:55.155
I can tell you're
a man that would run into a burning building

46:55.246 --> 46:56.987
without blinking an eye.

46:57.915 --> 46:59.189
Thing is, I...

46:59.750 --> 47:01.957
I think you're the one setting the fire.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.037
Well, you just can't
get enough of us, can you?

47:18.436 --> 47:20.973
Well, my mama was a redhead.

47:21.372 --> 47:23.648
Let's just say I have an affinity.

47:24.775 --> 47:26.618
You interested in growing that stack?

47:27.778 --> 47:30.816
Why, you gonna
offer to help us invest it or something?

47:30.881 --> 47:33.020
I got another job I need done.

47:33.517 --> 47:37.863
Now, I understand that you are a lawyer.

47:37.955 --> 47:39.696
Man, she ain't no lawyer.

47:39.790 --> 47:41.463
Well, whatever you are,

47:41.525 --> 47:44.870
I'm gonna cue the part of the conversation
you don't want to hear

47:44.962 --> 47:49.035
so that you can go on pretending you don't
know what your family does for a living.

47:58.676 --> 48:00.178
Man, you something else, Boyd.

48:02.913 --> 48:05.723
I assume this next job ain't gonna be as fun

48:05.816 --> 48:08.228
as whupping on a bunch of skinheads,
am I right?

48:08.319 --> 48:12.233
Well' that depends on
your definition of "fun", Darryl Crowe, Jr.

48:14.058 --> 48:17.267
I want you to help me kill my cousin Johnny.
