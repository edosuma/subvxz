WEBVTT

00:15.433 --> 00:17.810
The Constitution only recognizes

00:17.810 --> 00:20.104
that all people when
they are illegal are immoral.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.231
And then they get busted

00:22.231 --> 00:25.067
and they're indecent,
and that's where it's at.

00:25.067 --> 00:28.195
Now, the last four years I spent
in and out of the courts.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.781
And I figured out,

00:30.781 --> 00:33.159
after four years, uh,
why I got arrested

00:33.159 --> 00:34.744
so many times.

00:34.744 --> 00:36.328
Dig what happened. Uh...

00:36.328 --> 00:39.123
I do my act at, oh, perhaps,

00:39.123 --> 00:41.000
Eleven o'clock at night.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.461
Little do I know that
11:00 a.m. the next morning,

00:43.461 --> 00:45.463
before the grand jury somewhere,

00:45.463 --> 00:47.840
there's another guy doing my act

00:47.840 --> 00:51.302
who's introduced
as Lenny Bruce... in substance.

00:51.302 --> 00:54.138
"Here he is, Lenny Bruce.
In substance."

00:54.138 --> 00:57.391
A peace officer,
who is trained for,

00:57.391 --> 00:59.769
to recognize
clear and present danger,

00:59.769 --> 01:01.771
not make believe, does the act.

01:01.771 --> 01:05.399
The grand jury watches him work,
and they go, "That stinks."

01:05.399 --> 01:07.485
But I get busted.

01:07.485 --> 01:09.862
And the irony is
that I have to go to court

01:09.862 --> 01:11.822
to defend his act.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.783
I want to show you this, here.

01:13.783 --> 01:15.242
Again?

01:15.242 --> 01:17.244
Uh, "Criminal Court,
City of New York,

01:17.244 --> 01:18.996
Part 2B,
County of New York."

01:20.748 --> 01:23.709
Uh, "The honorable judges and"
blah, blah, blah.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.504
"...attorney."

01:27.588 --> 01:31.133
"By the information
filed on April 3, 1964,

01:31.133 --> 01:34.053
the defendants Lenny Bruce and
Harold L. Solomon were charged

01:34.053 --> 01:36.847
in two separate counts,
giving an indecent performance

01:36.847 --> 01:40.726
in violation of Section 1148
of the penal law of New York."

01:40.726 --> 01:42.686
All right,
now that's the grand jury.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.688
That was the first bust.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.524
Uh...

01:46.524 --> 01:49.443
"During the first performance,
Bruce fondles the microphone

01:49.443 --> 01:51.445
in a masturbatory fashion.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.489
Second performance, while
telling an act of exposure,

01:53.489 --> 01:55.533
Bruce then turned his back
toward the audience

01:55.533 --> 01:57.660
and moved his hand outward
and upward, below his waist,

01:57.660 --> 02:00.079
in an obvious
and crude pantomime

02:00.079 --> 02:03.332
of an act of exposure
and masturbation."

02:03.332 --> 02:05.334
Okay, so I said,
"Make sure to tell him

02:05.334 --> 02:07.837
it's gestures of benediction,
not masturbation."

02:07.837 --> 02:10.464
Because, like, I would never
make gestures of masturbation.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.551
Because I like, like,
I'm-I'm concerned with, uh...

02:13.551 --> 02:15.636
with, uh, my-my image and I know

02:15.636 --> 02:17.513
you know, what offends chicks.

02:17.513 --> 02:20.516
Uh, what's ugly to them,
uh, what frightens them.

02:20.516 --> 02:23.602
So I said, "Tell him it's
gestures of benediction."

02:25.396 --> 02:27.606
Okay.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.650
Uh...

02:29.650 --> 02:31.277
Ah, "Three...

02:31.277 --> 02:33.737
Saint Paul giving up fucking."

02:33.737 --> 02:36.323
Okay, what I said there was...

02:36.323 --> 02:38.242
Uh, that's
how the bit is reported.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.786
But I said that, uh...

02:40.786 --> 02:42.997
Oh, I forget, it's been
so long since I did that bit.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.082
Uh...

02:45.082 --> 02:47.543
I said that, uh...

02:47.543 --> 02:49.628
I said, uh, how the hell
did I do that bit? I said...

02:49.628 --> 02:51.380
Now I see, I...

02:51.380 --> 02:53.007
I forget the bit, I...
No, it's weird

02:53.007 --> 02:55.259
'cause I didn't know
that was a bit that they...

02:55.259 --> 02:57.553
that they put in there
and, uh...

02:57.553 --> 02:59.805
I forget where it,
where it started.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.766
I think I was talking about
the how the Jews lost...

03:04.602 --> 03:06.562
Ah.

03:06.562 --> 03:08.522
- Hey, do you want
to see my dance?
- No!

03:08.522 --> 03:10.316
Yeah, I'll do my dance
for you, uh...

03:10.316 --> 03:12.151
Here, this is the first time
that I've ever danced

03:12.151 --> 03:13.986
in front of an audience.

03:13.986 --> 03:16.030
This is my, uh,
my American folk dance.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.573
Uh...

03:27.833 --> 03:31.754
Hello. Dirty Lenny's in here.

03:31.754 --> 03:33.631
Dirty Lenny is going on soon.

03:33.631 --> 03:35.549
The pornographer.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.260
Uh, look, I really dug
working with you.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.263
I did, and, uh...
Oh, as Will Rogers once said,

03:41.263 --> 03:43.349
"I never met a dyke
I didn't like."

03:43.349 --> 03:45.267

so she should.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.889

10:02.352 --> 10:04.438

10:30.130 --> 10:32.257
uninvited, just standing there.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.551
They don't even have the decency

10:34.551 --> 10:37.095
to get fat or unattractive
or stupid or dull.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.556
And now they're blonde.
Fucking blonde!

10:41.808 --> 10:43.810
You were...

10:44.936 --> 10:46.938
...involved?

10:50.776 --> 10:52.986
I was on a scholarship
at Pembroke.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.530
I had to work
in the dining room, bus tables.

10:55.530 --> 10:58.408
Every day, this rich girl
and her friends would come in.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.077
They always sat in my section.

11:00.077 --> 11:02.913
And she'd wave me over,
wanting sugar cubes.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.916
Okay, now there were fucking
sugar cubes already there,

11:05.916 --> 11:07.542
right in front of her,
it didn't matter.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.669
She'd call me over
asking about sugar cubes.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.880
Every goddamned day.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.715
Well, finally, I had it.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.550
Told her to fuck off.

11:15.550 --> 11:18.345
Wasn't there to be her
dinner theater entertainment.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.264
And she looks at me
and she says,

11:21.264 --> 11:23.725
"But I just wanted
to talk to you."

11:25.268 --> 11:27.270
That was it.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.689
Eight fucking words
that cursed my life.

11:31.858 --> 11:35.153
So, just to be super clear,
you two were... together.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.407
Meaning what did she see in me?

11:38.407 --> 11:40.575
No, of course not.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.661
I know exactly
what she saw in you.

11:42.661 --> 11:45.038
It was an unnatural pairing,
okay? I know that.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.332
It was just dumb.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.751
We looked ridiculous together.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.129
I had one warm hat.

11:52.129 --> 11:54.381
Furry, ear flaps.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.299
When I wore it,
I looked like her dog.

11:56.299 --> 11:58.176
Like she was taking me out
for a fucking walk.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.678
I know that's not true.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.346
We fought all the time.

12:01.346 --> 12:04.141
I hated her friends.
She hated going to clubs.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.309
I never met her family.
She never met my family.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.061
She chewed weird.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.896
- Hmm.
- I always caught her drawing me

12:09.896 --> 12:12.023
when I wasn't looking.

12:12.023 --> 12:14.526
She would spend hours
doing her hair.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.820
Boring me stiff
talking about art, but...

12:18.530 --> 12:20.449
You know, she was also smart...

12:20.449 --> 12:22.325
and funny.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.578
I actually believed her

12:24.578 --> 12:27.539
when she said after college,
we'd move to Egypt

12:27.539 --> 12:29.624
and rent out camels
to rich tourists.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.712
We were gonna adopt four of
the ugliest kids in the world,

12:33.712 --> 12:36.298
raise them to be
really snobby, arrogant fucks.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.383
Just confuse the shit
out of everyone.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.761
Junior year,

12:41.761 --> 12:43.472
her mother took her to Paris.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.599
And she came back engaged.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.146
I mean, she didn't marry him,
but that was it.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.398
So I dropped out,
moved to New York.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.984
Burned that fucking hat.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.862
Oh, Susie. I am so sorry.

12:58.862 --> 13:01.406
I didn't know.
I never would've asked you

13:01.406 --> 13:03.241
to go to her if I had, never.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.243
No. I'm your manager.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.245
You were right. Had to be done.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.918
Is that the only time
you've been in love?

13:12.918 --> 13:14.336
I didn't say love.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.129
Okay.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.881
But yes.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.966
And the last.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.804
I think
you'll fall in love again.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.058
Uh-huh. I'm sure it will have
the same disastrous outcome.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.143
Why would you say that?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.731
Were you ever a blonde?

13:34.731 --> 13:36.233
I was.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.193
College. For a bit.

13:38.193 --> 13:40.070
Yeah.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.155
I figured.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.286
Rose, I think we've been had.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.247
Neither of those children
are sick.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.790
What are you talking about?

13:51.790 --> 13:53.750
I just overheard them
laughing at us

13:53.750 --> 13:55.502
for falling for their scam.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.420
Calling us nitwits
and dodo birds.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.798
I felt Ethan's head.
He was burning up.

13:59.798 --> 14:01.967
Apparently, he stuck his head
under the hot water faucet

14:01.967 --> 14:03.760
- for ten full minutes.
- What?

14:03.760 --> 14:06.346
It was Esther's idea. She
orchestrated the whole thing.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.431
Well, that's terrible.
They should be punished.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.267
I agree. I'm going to the <i>Voice.</i>

14:10.267 --> 14:11.893
Aren't you going to punish them?

14:11.893 --> 14:13.311
I have an editorial meeting.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.438
You're not suggesting
that I punish them?

14:15.438 --> 14:17.399
You know, keep it minimal.
They're young.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.359
But they did call us nitwits.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.486
Oh, good,
their mother can do it.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.363
- Do what?
- Discipline your children.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.615
- For what?
- They feigned illness
and called us names.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.909
- To your face? Bold.
- Ah-ha-ha!

14:27.909 --> 14:29.578
Now they're rubbing
our noses in it.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.746
You also have to tell
those people at your work

14:31.746 --> 14:33.623
that this is a home,
not an answering service.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.958
I don't know
what you're talking about, Mama.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.418
They have been calling
all morning.

14:36.418 --> 14:38.003
Six times, to be exact.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.671
I told Alvin I'd be back
this afternoon.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.214
- He knew that.
- And by the way,

14:41.214 --> 14:43.425
they say that children who lie
become violent criminals.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.885
- I have to change, Mama.
- Does this not concern you?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.888
- Not particularly.
- Hmm. I thought,
as their mother,

14:48.888 --> 14:50.640
you might want
to do something about it.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.642
- Like what?
- How should I know?

14:52.642 --> 14:55.103
And there you have it.
I learned from the best.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.739
- Alvin?
- Yes?

15:05.739 --> 15:08.116
I will have you know that I am
here on time every single day.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.785
- Well...
- On time enough
every single day.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.245
I do not call in sick.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.747
I do not come in hungover.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.707
- Why is she looking at me?
- I stay for every show.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.167
I go to every event.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.877
I get you the fresh peanuts
at Toots Shor.

15:18.877 --> 15:21.046
I make sure you boys eat,

15:21.046 --> 15:22.797
that the creamer was
sold in this century.

15:22.797 --> 15:25.550
I cover for you when you are
with your bookie, so...

15:25.550 --> 15:27.552
if I need a couple of hours
one afternoon to deal with

15:27.552 --> 15:29.763
a personal matter, you should
accept that without calling

15:29.763 --> 15:31.931
constantly like Adam's wife.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.684
I have two children.
I have elderly parents.

15:34.684 --> 15:38.480
I have responsibilities that
sometimes require my attention.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.606
Is something wrong
with your children?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.483
No, besides becoming sociopaths,

15:41.483 --> 15:42.942
my children are fine.
That's not the point.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.611
Something happen
to your parents?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.446
My parents are fine. I'm just
saying you are not taking into

15:46.446 --> 15:49.532
account that I have children
or extremely old parents.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.701
- Did you go shopping?
- Why, Mel?

15:51.701 --> 15:54.371
Because I'm a woman?
And all women do is shop?

15:54.371 --> 15:55.872
No, because you're
in a different outfit

15:55.872 --> 15:57.749
from this morning
and it has the tag on it.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.544
Okay. Yes.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.797
This is a new dress.
But I did not go shopping.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.256
And I did not call you.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.258
Oh. Well, who did?

16:07.258 --> 16:09.386
Midge, I've been calling you.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.221
Gordon wants to see you.

16:11.221 --> 16:12.764
Oh.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.432
Sure.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.524
Did she say her children
were sociopaths?

16:22.524 --> 16:24.067
Uh-huh.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.528
Gordon? I got Midge.

16:28.196 --> 16:29.989
Give us a minute, Mike?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.283
Uh... sure.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.791
What happened with Paar?

16:39.791 --> 16:41.668
- What?
- He book you?

16:41.668 --> 16:43.378
- Nope.
- Was he there?

16:43.378 --> 16:44.754
Yep.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.089
- So he saw you.
- He did.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.924
- You didn't wow him?
- I was great.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.509
So I guess this "you'll see"
that you threw

16:49.509 --> 16:50.844
in my face is gonna
have to wait a while.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.387
That's okay.

16:52.387 --> 16:53.722
I'm patient.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.014
Patient?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.558
Mm, funny.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.935
Is that why you
called out your hounds?

16:58.935 --> 17:00.687
What hounds?

17:00.687 --> 17:02.522
Yeah. Sure.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.607
Okay.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.276
You win, you're on the show.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.945
The show? This show?

17:08.945 --> 17:10.530
That's the one.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.490
Wow.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.492
Really?

17:14.492 --> 17:16.828
Well... wow.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.204
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

17:18.204 --> 17:19.539
You're on the show tonight.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.832
Oh. Uh...

17:20.832 --> 17:22.000
- Problem?
- No.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.334
- No problem.
- Not convenient?

17:23.334 --> 17:24.669
- I didn't say that.
- Want to check with

17:24.669 --> 17:25.962
- your girl, have her get
back to my girl?
- No.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.172
I can just put
the whole show on hiatus

17:27.172 --> 17:28.173
till you decide
what works for you.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.716
Tonight is great.
Best night ever.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.301
- Love tonight. I'm sure.
- You sure?

17:31.301 --> 17:32.635
- I'm thrilled.
- I can tell.

17:34.596 --> 17:37.056
Does it bother you
that I'm thrilled?

17:37.056 --> 17:39.142
I'm thrilled you're thrilled.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.729
Okay, well, I guess that's it.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.564
Gordon.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.649
Yeah?

17:49.652 --> 17:52.071
- See you tonight.
- See you tonight.

17:57.786 --> 18:00.079
You want the door closed?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.415
I do, otherwise when I hurl
this glass at it,

18:02.415 --> 18:04.209
it will fly out into the bullpen
and hit someone on the head.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.169
- Lawsuits.
- Sure.

18:06.169 --> 18:07.921
Yeah, you got to think
about these things.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.589
That's why you're the boss.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.342
Yes, the boss. That is me.

18:30.401 --> 18:32.612
- It's too obscure.
- No, it's not,
if I ask my mother...

18:32.612 --> 18:34.531
Alvin. I have to go home.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.950
- You just got here.
- I know. I have to change.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.660
- You just changed.
- We saw the tag.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.912
- I need a different outfit.
- Why?

18:40.912 --> 18:43.414
I am gonna be
on the show tonight.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.291
- What?
- How?
- What happened to the rule?

18:45.291 --> 18:47.585
- Did they change the rule?
- Alvin!
- That's bullshit, Alvin!

18:47.585 --> 18:49.629
- What the fuck?
- What the ever-loving fuck?

18:49.629 --> 18:52.090
Whoa, boys, stop being
so happy for me, seriously.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.384
I might cry.
I'm going on the show tonight.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.386
And I'm in work clothes.
I need show clothes.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.264
- Very different clothes.
- How?

18:59.264 --> 19:00.765
I could explain it to you,
but there will be terms

19:00.765 --> 19:01.891
like "side darts"
and "ruching" bandied about.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.643
Go. Please.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.186
I wouldn't have to change
if I got on the show.

19:06.729 --> 19:07.814
<i>- Yank it!
- I'm yanking it.</i>

19:07.814 --> 19:09.148
<i>It's not moving.</i>

19:09.148 --> 19:11.317
- Try a jiggle.
- If you jiggle, it will fall.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.695
- It's not moving.
- What we need is a squirrel.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.321
To do what, Maggie?

19:15.321 --> 19:16.948
To go out there
and get the package.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.908
So a trained squirrel?
You're saying we need

19:18.908 --> 19:21.035
a trained squirrel. Am I
understanding this correctly?

19:21.035 --> 19:23.121
- Well, it wouldn't hurt.
- This thing is not moving.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.665
Shit. Do you remember
who the envelope was from?

19:25.665 --> 19:27.458
The messenger just said delivery

19:27.458 --> 19:29.168
for Susie Myerson
and Associates.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.045
Did it ever occur to you
to tell him

19:31.045 --> 19:33.464
to just walk two feet
to the left and actually drop it

19:33.464 --> 19:35.049
at Susie Myerson and Associates?

19:35.049 --> 19:36.759
- No.
- Why not?

19:36.759 --> 19:38.636
Because we have the bucket!

19:38.636 --> 19:40.221
The bucket is fun.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.806
What's scary is
that we are three

19:41.806 --> 19:43.558
of the more intelligent
people in show business.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.728
How do you like my dress?

19:46.728 --> 19:48.438
Why aren't you at work?

19:48.438 --> 19:50.064
- Do you like it?
- Miriam, please.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.524
One ding-dong at a time.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.067
Do you think this is a dress
that says, "I'm gonna be

19:53.067 --> 19:54.235
on <i>The Gordon Ford Show</i>
tonight"?

19:54.235 --> 19:56.195
Sure.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.239
What? Fuck you.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.033
No, fuck you.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.368
- Are you serious?
- I'm Antigone
without the laughs.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.162
I can't believe it.
What happened?

20:04.162 --> 20:05.788
Gordon called me
into his office and told me

20:05.788 --> 20:08.166
- I'm on the show. Tonight.
- Geez, short notice.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.542
- He was pissed.
- Why?

20:09.542 --> 20:12.170
- Why do you think?
- She asked him.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.631
- I think she asked him.
- Well, I'll be damned.

20:14.631 --> 20:17.050
- I don't think he liked us
going around him.
- Tough shit.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.551
That's what you do
when a big dead moose is lying

20:18.551 --> 20:20.261
in the middle of the road.
You roll the fuck over him,

20:20.261 --> 20:21.971
hack him up and make a stew.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.515
- I'm gonna be on the show!
- You are gonna be on the show.

20:24.515 --> 20:27.101
- I'm gonna be on the show.
- You're gonna be on the show!

20:27.101 --> 20:28.728
Okay, I have to find my mother.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.313
She is not gonna
avoid it this time.

20:30.313 --> 20:31.689
She's gonna come
to the studio and she's gonna

20:31.689 --> 20:32.899
sit there and take it.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.651
<i>♪ That's entertainment ♪</i>

20:34.651 --> 20:36.361
- Dinah, what line can I use?
- Line two.

20:36.361 --> 20:38.321
- I'm in your office.
- Okay. You!

20:38.321 --> 20:40.865
Get out that Rolodex you've got
and call everyone we know

20:40.865 --> 20:42.825
or don't know and tell them
to watch the show tonight.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.661
You? You find us that squirrel.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.079
On it.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.086
- Stay focused.
- Focused. Yes.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.963
We're here for 12 uniforms
for the supper club.

20:54.963 --> 20:58.466
Only 12. And only the exact
uniforms we agreed on last week.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.635
- I brought the picture.
- Never say yes immediately.

21:00.635 --> 21:02.595
They will try
and lay their crap inventory

21:02.595 --> 21:04.013
off on us just like last time.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.348
I know. I'm still sorry
I fell for it.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.349
I don't know what I thought
we were gonna do

21:06.349 --> 21:07.350
with all those hoop skirts.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.434
My mother's a born hustler.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.852
Just don't leave me alone
with her again.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.479
I've located the uniforms.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.189
They were hidden in the back,
of course.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.857
You'd think they'd come up
with some new tricks by now.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.776
But there's something else
going on here.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.654
There are men cataloguing
everything in the place.

21:19.654 --> 21:20.822
What? What for?

21:20.822 --> 21:22.991
I don't know.
But I'm gonna find out.

21:22.991 --> 21:25.576
Ma? Pop? I'm here.

21:25.576 --> 21:26.828
Hold on, Joely.

21:26.828 --> 21:28.246
Yeah, we're coming!

21:28.246 --> 21:31.165
You know, it's not too late
to go to Macy's.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.876
- Oh, my God.
- Don't fall for it.

21:33.876 --> 21:34.961
But they have canes.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.212
Anybody can get a cane.

21:36.212 --> 21:37.505
Hello, Joel.

21:37.505 --> 21:40.008
Just kiss me from there, Joely.
I'm fragile.

21:40.008 --> 21:42.260
- What happened here?
- It's a long story.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.386
I got time.

21:43.386 --> 21:45.179
Okay. Well...

21:45.179 --> 21:47.557
Manny's in Florida
visiting his sister.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.600
<i>So Moishe's
been getting up early every day</i>

21:49.600 --> 21:51.519
<i>- to open the factory.
- Anyhow, I'm up,</i>

21:51.519 --> 21:53.604
<i>I'm in the shower,
I drop the soap.</i>

21:53.604 --> 21:55.982
<i>Bent over to pick it up,
and suddenly...</i>

21:55.982 --> 21:57.734
- Whoa!
- <i>Bam, I'm down.</i>

21:57.734 --> 21:59.318
<i>- Pop, Jesus.
- I'm down hard.</i>

21:59.318 --> 22:01.237
- <i>So I call out for Shirley.</i>
- Shirley!

22:01.237 --> 22:02.905
- I'm in bed, dead asleep.
- A corpse.

22:02.905 --> 22:05.450
Suddenly, I hear Moishe
calling out my name.

22:05.450 --> 22:06.451
Now, it's dark.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.119
It's cold. I have nothing on.

22:08.119 --> 22:10.121
- Not a stitch.
- Ma, please.

22:10.121 --> 22:11.748
So I grab
the first thing I can find

22:11.748 --> 22:13.249
- <i>and I ran in.</i>
- Moishe!

22:13.249 --> 22:14.625
<i>But when he fell,
he splashed water</i>

22:14.625 --> 22:16.419
- <i>all over the bathroom floor.</i>
- Ow!

22:16.419 --> 22:17.754
I'm down like a rock.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.922
And that rock
fell right on top of me.

22:19.922 --> 22:20.965
I thought
I broke everything.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.467
My coat was soaking wet.

22:22.467 --> 22:25.219
It was like having a wet yak
laying all over you.

22:25.219 --> 22:26.971
The cleaning lady
wasn't coming till later

22:26.971 --> 22:28.765
- that morning.
- We just lay there.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.391
And talked.

22:30.391 --> 22:33.394
<i>Just talked
about everything.</i>

22:33.394 --> 22:35.980
<i>What else can you do in a
situation like that besides die?</i>

22:35.980 --> 22:37.440
<i>We haven't talked
like that in years.</i>

22:37.440 --> 22:39.442
<i>And for the first time,
I really listened.</i>

22:39.442 --> 22:41.069
<i>And I listened, too.</i>

22:41.069 --> 22:42.987
<i>It was
a terrific moment.</i>

22:42.987 --> 22:44.947
I love you so much!

22:44.947 --> 22:47.366
Anyhow, your mother convinced me
I was being silly.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.327
There's more to life
than this factory.

22:49.327 --> 22:51.621
And since I'm not
keeping it going for you...

22:51.621 --> 22:53.331
Moishe's gonna retire.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.415
What? Really?

22:54.415 --> 22:55.541
Selling the business.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.502
- Everything goes.
- Just like that?

22:57.502 --> 22:59.253
Sometimes it takes
falling in the shower

22:59.253 --> 23:01.672
for everything
to become very clear.

23:01.672 --> 23:03.091
Life is precious.

23:03.091 --> 23:04.675
And it's not all about you.

23:04.675 --> 23:07.887
You have to think about
the other people in your life.

23:07.887 --> 23:08.888
What about the workers?

23:08.888 --> 23:10.056
Fuck 'em.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.016
Anyhow, the headline is
I'm retiring.

23:12.016 --> 23:13.851
As soon
as we can walk again,

23:13.851 --> 23:16.354
we are selling the house
and getting a condo in Boca.

23:16.354 --> 23:18.147
Well, I'm stunned.

23:18.147 --> 23:19.690
But happy?

23:19.690 --> 23:21.609
- If you're happy, I'm happy.
- Mr. Maisel!

23:21.609 --> 23:24.278
Excuse me, Mr. Maisel,
there's a phone call for you.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.613
Me?

23:25.613 --> 23:26.739
Okay.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.990
I'll be right back.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.451
Okay, Arch, Arch, come here.
Come here.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.286
Let's talk about those uniforms.

23:32.286 --> 23:33.788
Now, I know...

23:34.914 --> 23:35.832
Hello?

23:35.832 --> 23:37.458
Hey. Sorry to bug you.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.752
<i>No. Please, distract me.</i>

23:39.752 --> 23:41.796
I'm gonna be
on <i>The Gordon Ford Show</i> tonight.

23:41.796 --> 23:42.797
<i>What?</i>

23:42.797 --> 23:44.340
Midge, this is incredible.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.341
<i>I know.</i>

23:45.341 --> 23:47.009
Can't believe it.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.845
I'm almost afraid
to keep saying it out loud.

23:48.845 --> 23:49.846
It might go away.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.347
No. No, it won't go away.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.473
This is big.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.642
It's the break
I've been waiting for.

23:54.642 --> 23:56.394
<i>Are you ready?</i>

23:56.394 --> 23:58.354
I'd better be, right?

23:58.354 --> 24:00.815
Listen,
if you need to talk about me,

24:00.815 --> 24:02.608
us, whatever, go ahead.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.902
- <i>I don't mind.</i>
- Oh.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.320
- Joel...
- <i>I mean it.</i>

24:06.320 --> 24:08.072
I'd love to be able to
still live in New York tomorrow,

24:08.072 --> 24:09.323
but if not, so be it.

24:10.825 --> 24:12.660
Have I ever told you
that you are amazing?

24:12.660 --> 24:13.828
You have.

24:13.828 --> 24:14.912
A lot.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.122
More than I deserve.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.124
Hey.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.917
You want to come down
to the studio?

24:19.917 --> 24:22.170
Watch me trash you
on national television?

24:22.170 --> 24:24.547
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:24.547 --> 24:25.631
I'd like you there.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.841
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

24:26.841 --> 24:28.301
<i>8:30.</i>

24:28.301 --> 24:30.970
I'll leave the tickets
under "The one that got away."

24:30.970 --> 24:32.305
You break a leg.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.265
Bye, Joel.

24:42.607 --> 24:43.774
Okay.

24:43.774 --> 24:45.943
I'm heading to the studio.

24:45.943 --> 24:47.111
Hold on. I'm going with you.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.946
Can you hold, please?
Midge. Elbow.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.531
What? Shit.

24:50.531 --> 24:51.949
- Shit.
- What is it?

24:51.949 --> 24:53.659
Shit. It's shit.

24:53.659 --> 24:54.827
- Pigeon shit.
- What?

24:54.827 --> 24:56.871
Fuck. Did you lean on the sill?

24:56.871 --> 24:58.873
You never lean on the sill, Miriam.

24:58.873 --> 24:59.916
The sill belongs to the pigeons.

24:59.916 --> 25:00.958
I have to change again.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.251
Into what? One of my suits?

25:02.251 --> 25:04.295
Well, I can't go on like this.

25:04.295 --> 25:06.005
Wait, can we stop by Bergdorf's?

25:06.005 --> 25:07.548
You are not going shopping.

25:07.548 --> 25:08.883
No one has that kind of time.

25:08.883 --> 25:10.092
They'd have to postpone
the show by a week.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.302
I have a couple dresses
on hold there.

25:11.302 --> 25:12.428
One of them could work.

25:12.428 --> 25:13.930
I'll get them.
You get to the studio.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.556
- Really?
- Go, go, go!

25:15.556 --> 25:17.600
Why do you let pigeons
shit all over your sill?

25:17.600 --> 25:18.726
Because they're pigeons.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.311
Their world is small, Miriam.

25:20.311 --> 25:21.479
Give them something.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.777
<i>"The best advice
I have for girls</i>

25:27.777 --> 25:29.237
<i>who want
to have babies someday is</i>

25:29.237 --> 25:31.030
live with your parents
so they can raise them."

25:31.030 --> 25:33.032
- Maybe.
- Mm.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.701
"My kids aren't babies anymore,
which is sad for a mother.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.370
Now I have to hear their
opinions on the stupid outfits

25:37.370 --> 25:39.664
I..." Too orange. "The stupid
outfits I put on them."

25:39.664 --> 25:41.040
No.

25:42.416 --> 25:43.918
"My son thinks I'm funny.

25:43.918 --> 25:46.003
My daughter thinks
she's adopted." Too dark.

25:46.003 --> 25:47.421
- The joke?
- The liner.

25:47.421 --> 25:48.923
You sure
you wouldn't like to do it?

25:48.923 --> 25:50.800
Please. You're the professional.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.344
"A lot of people ask me why I go
out and perform comedy at night

25:53.344 --> 25:55.096
when I have two young kids
at home." No.

25:55.096 --> 25:57.723
"And I tell them, 'Because
they're bad laughers.'" No.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.809
Yeah, I'm wondering if I
should mention the kids at all.

25:59.809 --> 26:02.311
Mm, kids are relatable. Those
little fuckers are everywhere.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.313
I know, but will people hate
a mother making jokes

26:04.313 --> 26:06.190
- about her children?
- No. Why?

26:06.190 --> 26:07.858
Because a mother's supposed
to love her children

26:07.858 --> 26:10.111
and be soft and caring
and bullshit,

26:10.111 --> 26:11.654
- bullshit, bull... Just let me.
- Yep.

26:11.654 --> 26:14.156
Got 'em. I had them reinforce
all the hooks and buttons

26:14.156 --> 26:16.284
so there's no surprises
on national television.

26:16.284 --> 26:18.119
Plus, I didn't know what
your stocking situation was,

26:18.119 --> 26:19.954
so I got you
a couple extra pairs.

26:19.954 --> 26:21.497
Dinah, will you marry me?

26:21.497 --> 26:22.999
I am not marrying a comedian.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.583
Fair enough.
How much do I owe you?

26:24.583 --> 26:25.584
Nothing.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.836
You are not paying for this.

26:26.836 --> 26:28.379
I am not paying for this.

26:28.379 --> 26:30.798
- I am not paying for this.
- No one is paying for this.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.425
I told them you'd be wearing
one of these fine dresses

26:32.425 --> 26:33.592
on <i>The Gordon Ford Show</i> tonight,

26:33.592 --> 26:34.760
so as long
as you mention Bergdorf's,

26:34.760 --> 26:35.970
it's all free.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.722
Dinah, are you sure
you won't marry me?

26:37.722 --> 26:39.473
Let's get back
to the set order, please.

26:39.473 --> 26:40.766
Time's a-tickin'.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.019
I think I should pull back
on the kid stuff.

26:43.019 --> 26:45.146
Okay, but you know if you do,
the minute you open your mouth,

26:45.146 --> 26:47.064
the first thing that comes out
will be "I hate kids.

26:47.064 --> 26:48.316
You can all suck my dick."

26:48.316 --> 26:49.817
I don't think
that'll be the first thing

26:49.817 --> 26:51.360
- that comes out of my mouth.
- Midge!

26:51.360 --> 26:52.361
Success!

26:52.361 --> 26:53.738
Excellent.

26:54.822 --> 26:56.574
He's on Millie's line.

26:56.574 --> 26:58.701
- This one right here.
- Here.

26:58.701 --> 27:01.162
- Hi.
- My God, you people
are hard to find.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.163
What are you talking about?

27:02.163 --> 27:03.414
<i>I've been looking for you.</i>

27:03.414 --> 27:05.124
- I'm at work.
- <i>I know that now.</i>

27:05.124 --> 27:07.418
Well, then, mystery solved.
Goodbye, Miriam.

27:07.418 --> 27:08.669
I-I've been trying
to get ahold of Mama,

27:08.669 --> 27:10.212
but she's been on the phone
for four hours

27:10.212 --> 27:11.547
and she wasn't home
when I was there earlier.

27:11.547 --> 27:12.757
<i>Why were you home earlier?</i>

27:12.757 --> 27:13.758
I went home to change.

27:13.758 --> 27:14.800
- Again?
- <i>Yes.</i>

27:14.800 --> 27:16.344
For the second time today?

27:16.344 --> 27:17.845
Yes. Well, third time,

27:17.845 --> 27:19.680
once Dinah got here
with my dress from Bergdorf's.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.683
I need someone young to listen
in on this and explain it to me.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.393
<i>Listen, I have amazing news.</i>

27:25.436 --> 27:27.772
I am gonna be
on <i>The Gordon Ford Show</i> tonight.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.899
- Doing what?
- Stand-up.

27:29.899 --> 27:31.317
You're a guest?

27:31.317 --> 27:33.402
- <i>I am a guest.</i>
- Well, I'll be.

27:33.402 --> 27:34.904
<i>I've been trying
to get ahold of Mama</i>

27:34.904 --> 27:37.156
because I have two tickets for
you guys to come down and watch.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.532
We go live tonight at 9:00,

27:38.532 --> 27:40.409
<i>so you have to be
in your seat at 8:30.</i>

27:40.409 --> 27:41.786
8:30. Okay.

27:41.786 --> 27:43.162
- We'll be there.
- <i>Great.</i>

27:43.162 --> 27:44.497
I have to go. I'm...

27:44.497 --> 27:46.123
sitting here in the bullpen
in my underwear...

27:46.123 --> 27:47.458
- I don't want to hear anymore.
- <i>But I...</i>

27:47.458 --> 27:49.251
Not a word. See you tonight.

27:49.251 --> 27:50.711
Uh, wait! Miriam.

27:50.711 --> 27:52.505
<i>Yes?</i>

27:52.505 --> 27:54.256
This is...

27:54.256 --> 27:56.175
really wonderful.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.346
Thank you, Papa.

28:06.227 --> 28:08.354
Oh. Uh...

28:08.354 --> 28:10.272
Monologue
doesn't write itself, boys.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.819
Rose!

28:16.195 --> 28:17.405
Rose!

28:17.405 --> 28:18.864
Uh, no. Stop right there.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.491
I just got everyone placed.

28:20.491 --> 28:22.576
Come on. We have to get going.

28:22.576 --> 28:25.121
- Where?
- I got a call from Miriam.

28:25.121 --> 28:28.582
She is going to be
on <i>The Gordon Ford Show</i> tonight.

28:28.582 --> 28:30.292
She's going to do her act.

28:30.292 --> 28:32.586
Oh. Well, good for her.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.171
We have to be there by 8:30.

28:34.171 --> 28:36.841
So do whatever you have to do
here to leave the house,

28:36.841 --> 28:38.592
because we have to go.

28:38.592 --> 28:39.760
I'm not going.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.388
What do you mean
you're not going?

28:42.388 --> 28:45.224
Miriam is going to be
on television.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.143
If she wanted me to be there,
she would've called me

28:47.143 --> 28:48.144
and asked me herself.

28:48.144 --> 28:49.812
She called you and asked you.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.605
You go and tell me how she was.

28:51.605 --> 28:53.607
She said she's been calling you

28:53.607 --> 28:55.901
and the line has been busy
for four hours.

28:55.901 --> 28:56.902
And you believe that?

28:56.902 --> 28:58.195
Why would she lie?

28:58.195 --> 28:59.488
Because she's a compulsive liar,

28:59.488 --> 29:00.656
just like her children.

29:00.656 --> 29:02.616
- I don't think that's true.
- How long

29:02.616 --> 29:04.702
did she lie to us
about doing stand-up comedy?

29:04.702 --> 29:07.538
Hmm? And about Susie
being a plumber?

29:07.538 --> 29:10.291
When she called us during
Ethan's fake birthday party,

29:10.291 --> 29:12.585
she said she was in Prague, when
she was really back in New York.

29:12.585 --> 29:15.254
And I was most certainly not
on the phone for four hours.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.089
I'm not
a 14-year-old bobby-soxer

29:17.089 --> 29:18.716
planning to elope with Elvis.

29:18.716 --> 29:20.426
Maybe there's something wrong
with the phone.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.261
There is nothing wrong
with the phone.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.305
I have been home all day
with the phone.

29:24.305 --> 29:25.890
I would know
if there was something wrong.

29:25.890 --> 29:27.141
Maybe the phone
was off the hook.

29:27.141 --> 29:29.310
The phone's
absolutely not off the...

29:32.062 --> 29:33.981
Well, that still doesn't prove
anyone was trying to call.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.818
- Hello?
- Rose. Thank God.

29:37.818 --> 29:39.361
I've been trying to get you
for the past four hours.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.030
<i>Midge is gonna be on</i>
The Gordon Ford Show <i>tonight</i>

29:41.030 --> 29:42.531
- <i>and she has tickets for you.</i>
- Oh.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.200
Well, thank you
for calling me, Joel.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.410
<i>You have to be there at 8:30.
The show starts at 9:00.</i>

29:46.410 --> 29:47.495
All right, Joel.

29:47.495 --> 29:49.079
- 8:30.
- Thank you, Joel.

29:49.079 --> 29:50.831
<i>I'm supposed to hear you say
you'll be there.</i>

29:52.374 --> 29:54.376
- Hello.
- Rose. Finally.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.794
I've been trying you for hours.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.464
<i>Listen, Miriam wanted me to call
to make sure you knew</i>

29:58.464 --> 30:00.841
<i>she's performing on</i>
The Gordon Ford Show <i>tonight.</i>

30:00.841 --> 30:03.093
- I know, Shirley.
- <i>They say to be here by 8:30,</i>

30:03.093 --> 30:05.054
<i>but I would say 8:15 to be safe.</i>

30:05.054 --> 30:07.806
They give out a lot
of the free stuff at 8:15.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.600
Frisbees, potholders,

30:09.600 --> 30:11.602
wineglasses
with leprechauns on them.

30:11.602 --> 30:12.770
Goodbye, Shirley.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.897
Hello.

30:14.897 --> 30:16.315
Hello,
Mrs. Weissman?

30:16.315 --> 30:18.359
My goodness, you like
to talk a lot on the phone.

30:18.359 --> 30:19.902
- I wasn't on the pho...
- <i>I don't have time.</i>

30:19.902 --> 30:21.654
<i>Miss Miriam is trying
to get in touch with you.</i>

30:21.654 --> 30:24.114
She's going to be funny tonight
on <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

30:24.114 --> 30:26.116
- <i>She has tickets for you
to come.</i>
- Why are you whispering?

30:26.116 --> 30:28.536
<i>Janusz does not want me
talking to you people anymore.</i>

30:28.536 --> 30:31.038
He says you are vampires
sucking the lifeblood out of us.

30:31.038 --> 30:32.373
Zelda,
who are you talking to?

30:32.373 --> 30:34.250
This never happened. Bye.

30:35.626 --> 30:36.544
Okay, so...

30:38.212 --> 30:39.838
This is Rose Weissman.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.049
- Shh! I got her.
- Oh, it's been hours.
- Oh, good.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.759
Midge wanted us to call you
and tell you that...

30:43.759 --> 30:45.803
- She's going to be on the show.
- Yes. And be there by...

30:45.803 --> 30:46.845
<i>8:15 if you want
to get the Frisbees.</i>

30:46.845 --> 30:48.472
I know. I heard. Thank you.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.809
- How long do we have?
- One hour.

30:51.809 --> 30:53.352
Let's go.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.062
I don't understand
why you didn't have

30:55.062 --> 30:56.689
Antonio hail us a cab.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.774
There were no cabs
to hail, Rose.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.568
Of course not. You didn't
let him blow the whistle.

31:00.568 --> 31:02.278
- What?
- The cab whistle.

31:02.278 --> 31:04.154
When he blows the whistle,
the cabs appear.

31:04.154 --> 31:06.490
They have to already be there
to hear the whistle.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.284
The whistle is not magic.

31:08.284 --> 31:10.160
Antonio is not a wizard.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.829
This is not Narnia.

31:11.829 --> 31:13.789
- Oh, dear.
- Well, now we know

31:13.789 --> 31:15.791
why there were no cabs
in front of the building.

31:15.791 --> 31:17.793
They are all here.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.587
Find a light.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.714
I don't see a light.
Do you have a whistle?

31:21.714 --> 31:24.091
Hello? Cab person?

31:24.091 --> 31:26.010
- Yoo-hoo?
- Excuse me?

31:26.010 --> 31:27.928
- 30 Rockefeller Center.
- No fares.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.888
- Why not?
- Shift change.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.724
- What did he say?
- He's not taking fares.

31:31.724 --> 31:33.601
Because you didn't
use the whistle.

31:33.601 --> 31:36.061
I'd try
the subway, pal!

31:37.146 --> 31:39.106
- Excuse me? Are you available?
- No, shift change.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.858
Excuse me, we need a cab.

31:40.858 --> 31:42.693
Hey, that was my foot
you almost ran over.

31:42.693 --> 31:44.528
- Excuse me, are you available?
- No.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.697
- Excuse me?
- Taxi!

31:46.697 --> 31:49.074
- Excuse me, we need a cab.
- Shift change, lady.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.744
I don't understand why you'd all
change shifts at the same time.

31:51.744 --> 31:53.495
How are we supposed
to get around somewhere?

31:53.495 --> 31:55.080
Hello there, are you available?

31:55.080 --> 31:57.082
- We're going
to 30 Rockefeller Center.
- I wish you luck.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.960
Excuse me, we need a cab.
We do not have a whistle!

31:59.960 --> 32:02.296
- Sorry, lady.
- Excuse me,

32:02.296 --> 32:04.965
we need a cab. I know there's
a shift change going on...

32:04.965 --> 32:06.425
Excuse me!

32:06.425 --> 32:08.844
My daughter's going
to be on television...

32:08.844 --> 32:11.096
I will pay you ten dollars

32:11.096 --> 32:13.015
- to not change shifts.
- Nope.

32:13.015 --> 32:14.975
She called me
and the phone was off the hook,

32:14.975 --> 32:16.352
which I had
no idea was happening,

32:16.352 --> 32:18.562
but my grandchildren can
reach it now, it's...

32:18.562 --> 32:20.189
I have ten dollars
if you don't change shifts.

32:20.189 --> 32:21.774
Nope, sorry.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.484
We've had a very strained
relationship since her husband

32:23.484 --> 32:26.528
left her and she became a
comedian, which I was hoping...

32:26.528 --> 32:28.906
Twenty dollars
to give us a ride!

32:28.906 --> 32:30.699
Plus whatever the ride costs.

32:30.699 --> 32:33.494
And if someone
in your family needs tutoring

32:33.494 --> 32:36.330
in advanced algebra
or differential equations,

32:36.330 --> 32:38.791
or a favorable theatrical review

32:38.791 --> 32:41.293
in <i>The Village Voice,</i>
I can make that happen as well.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.003
What is wrong with
the taxi industry?

32:43.003 --> 32:45.297
I offered this man
money and services.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.383
I offered that one
my wedding ring, nothing.

32:47.383 --> 32:48.967
And still he... wait, what?

32:48.967 --> 32:50.302
He looked at me
like I was insane.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.929
How could you offer him
your wedding ring?

32:51.929 --> 32:53.472
That belonged
to my great-grandmother.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.099
Abe, don't try to change
the subject.

32:55.099 --> 32:56.767
What? That was an heirloom.
It was priceless.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.560
She wouldn't even wear it.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.896
She sewed it into her wig,
so no one would steal it.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.648
A bus! I see a bus.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.149
I wish we had that whistle.

33:04.149 --> 33:06.568
- Ooh, please stop the bus!
- Wait!

33:06.568 --> 33:08.404
- Wait!
- Stop it now! Stop!

33:08.404 --> 33:10.114
- Do not move!
- Excuse me?

33:10.114 --> 33:12.449
- Excuse me,
Mr. Bus Driver!
- Excuse me!

33:12.449 --> 33:14.284
My daughter's going
to be on television!

33:29.800 --> 33:31.468
There you go, your set order.

33:31.468 --> 33:32.720
Nice and clear.
Can you read that?

33:32.720 --> 33:34.346
- I can.
- I'll pass it on.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.181
Susie, I can move your dinner
with Shel to tomorrow. Do it?

33:36.181 --> 33:37.725
Why am I having dinner
with Shel?

33:37.725 --> 33:39.268
Because you said
you wanted dinner with Shel.

33:39.268 --> 33:41.186
I hate Shel.
Cancel the dinner with Shel.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.689
I firmly believe that's the
best order for your set, so...

33:43.689 --> 33:45.107
See, you're fucking
with the best order

33:45.107 --> 33:46.900
just as I'm saying
it's the best order.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.569
That's a better order. Wait!

33:48.569 --> 33:49.778
Shel took over
the condo circuit.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.071
I need to have dinner with Shel.

33:51.071 --> 33:52.740
Cancel cancelling
my dinner with Shel.

33:52.740 --> 33:54.658
Alan Shepard.

33:54.658 --> 33:56.326
An American hero.

33:56.326 --> 33:58.245
- Thrilled to have you here.
- Thrilled to be here, Gordon.

33:58.245 --> 34:00.539
- I see you got our basket.
- I did. It's big.

34:00.539 --> 34:01.790
Well, we wanted you
to have a basket

34:01.790 --> 34:03.292
that you could see from space.

34:03.292 --> 34:05.127
Apologies in advance
if there are any jokes

34:05.127 --> 34:07.254
about little green men
or if the term "thrusters up"

34:07.254 --> 34:09.339
gets shouted out at any point
during the show tonight.

34:09.339 --> 34:11.383
Sign a picture for my wife,
and all will be forgiven.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.469
Deal. See you out there.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.555
- Maisel.
- Gordon. Hello.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.599
I am really excited
about tonight.

34:18.599 --> 34:20.559
What are you wearing?

34:20.559 --> 34:22.853
What? Uh, a dress?

34:22.853 --> 34:24.772
Is this a trick question?

34:24.772 --> 34:26.523
Just seems a little fancy.

34:26.523 --> 34:28.400
Well, I don't know.
I'm gonna do my act

34:28.400 --> 34:30.527
on <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>
That seemed to call for fancy.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.070
- Your act?
- Yes.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.655
You're not doing your act.

34:33.655 --> 34:35.240
Well, whose act am I doing?

34:35.240 --> 34:36.658
It'd better not be
Buddy Hackett's.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.285
'Cause his team is
quick to upset.

34:38.285 --> 34:40.287
Let me clear this up for you.
You're not coming on to perform.

34:40.287 --> 34:42.039
You're coming on as a writer.

34:42.039 --> 34:43.832
A writer?

34:43.832 --> 34:46.168
See if you can borrow a sweater
or something to throw over that.

34:47.669 --> 34:49.338
Susie.

34:49.338 --> 34:51.632
Mr. Ford? Mr. Ford.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.884
Mr. Ford, Susie Myerson.
Midge's manager.

34:53.884 --> 34:55.511
I know who you are.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.346
Listen, my client was
under the impression

34:57.346 --> 34:59.056
she was performing
on the show tonight.

34:59.056 --> 35:00.516
Really?
Who gave her that impression?

35:00.516 --> 35:02.267
You.
You gave her that impression.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.852
I said she was gonna be
on the show

35:03.852 --> 35:05.270
and she is gonna be on the show.

35:05.270 --> 35:06.855
- But not as a comic?
- No.

35:06.855 --> 35:08.732
- But she's a comic.
- Not here.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.109
Here, she's a writer, so she's
gonna come on as a writer.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.486
What does that mean?

35:12.486 --> 35:13.904
She's gonna come out
and get hemorrhoids?

35:13.904 --> 35:15.614
It means I will introduce her
as one of my writers

35:15.614 --> 35:17.324
and ask her
a couple of questions.

35:17.324 --> 35:18.742
She will answer them
and that's it.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.035
- Why?
- Why what?

35:20.035 --> 35:21.703
Why are you bringing her on
as a writer?

35:21.703 --> 35:23.121
Who gives a shit about that?

35:23.121 --> 35:24.706
It's a human interest piece.

35:24.706 --> 35:26.208
Like when a panda bear
gives birth in a zoo.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.710
- Only not quite as cute.
- She is not a panda bear.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.337
Look, she doesn't need
to come on the show at all.

35:30.337 --> 35:31.672
I can bring on Mel.

35:31.672 --> 35:32.965
He actually does look
like a panda bear,

35:32.965 --> 35:34.174
so it'll work even better.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.425
- Gordon...
- I'm due on set.

35:35.425 --> 35:37.719
I will see you out there.
Or not.

35:40.556 --> 35:42.224
What the fuck?

35:44.852 --> 35:47.437
Mike! Mike!

35:47.437 --> 35:53.151
Mike! Mike!

35:54.778 --> 35:57.573
Mike! Mike!

35:59.157 --> 36:02.369
Mike! Mike!

36:02.369 --> 36:06.248
Mike! Mike!

36:06.248 --> 36:08.041
Oh, my God! What?! What, Susie?

36:08.041 --> 36:09.459
What the ever-loving what?!

36:09.459 --> 36:10.836
He said she was
performing on the show.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.421
- And now she's not.
- She's not?

36:12.421 --> 36:14.673
- She's on the board.
- Don't you produce this shit?

36:14.673 --> 36:17.551
- Why don't you know anything?
- Why is she here
if she's not on the show?

36:17.551 --> 36:20.095
Oh, she's going on the show.
She's going on as a panda bear.

36:20.095 --> 36:22.598
I'm sorry, what?
Like, in a costume?

36:22.598 --> 36:24.266
A metaphorical
panda bear, Mike.

36:24.266 --> 36:25.642
I don't know what that is.

36:25.642 --> 36:27.102
It's bullshit.
That's what it is.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.770
Look, the big decisions
are always Gordon's.

36:28.770 --> 36:31.148
He says he wants
to interview her as a writer.

36:31.148 --> 36:32.566
What does that mean?

36:32.566 --> 36:33.942
She's gonna come out
and get hemorrhoids?

36:33.942 --> 36:35.569
- That's what I said!
- Wow.

36:35.569 --> 36:37.529
That sounds like
unadulterated shit.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.281
Fix this, Mike.

36:39.281 --> 36:41.408
- I will see what I can do.
- Fix this now!

36:41.408 --> 36:43.243
I fucking said
I will see what I can do.

36:43.243 --> 36:45.329
One minute,
ladies and gentlemen.

36:49.625 --> 36:52.085
- What's that?
- Last-minute pitch
for the opening line.

36:52.085 --> 36:54.004
Better. Give it to Teddy.

36:54.004 --> 36:57.424
There seems to be some confusion
about Midge's spot.

36:57.424 --> 36:59.635
Oh, don't get
in the middle of this.

36:59.635 --> 37:01.428
I'm in the middle of this,
Gordon. I'm your producer.

37:01.428 --> 37:03.472
I changed it to a human
interest piece, quick interview.

37:03.472 --> 37:05.682
Okay, but...

37:05.682 --> 37:07.643
- Show's starting, Mike.
- For those of you
still filing in...

37:07.643 --> 37:09.478
That podium won't man itself.

37:09.478 --> 37:11.396
...we are less than
one minute to air!

37:11.396 --> 37:13.607
You're in
for a great show tonight.

37:13.607 --> 37:16.401
Now we're about to get going,
so keep that energy up.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.236
This show's a live broadcast,

37:18.236 --> 37:20.364
- so that means
anything can happen...
- Rose! Abe!

37:20.364 --> 37:22.115
Abe, over here, over here!

37:22.115 --> 37:23.867
Oh, Shirley.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.577
Where's Moishe?

37:25.577 --> 37:27.329
Oh, he's on painkillers.
He thought he was Eva Perón,

37:27.329 --> 37:29.081
so I left him at home.

37:29.081 --> 37:31.249
- Here, Frisbees for you.
- Just a few things
to bear in mind...

37:31.249 --> 37:33.210
- Rose, Abe!
- ...no eating and drinking.

37:33.210 --> 37:35.087
- Hi! Hey!
- Please no unwrapping candy,

37:35.087 --> 37:37.255
keep the aisles clear,
and if you have to leave,

37:37.255 --> 37:38.799
please do so quietly.

37:38.799 --> 37:41.510
Emergency exit doors are
on both sides in the back.

37:41.510 --> 37:44.221
Other than that,
make a lot of noise

37:44.221 --> 37:46.932
when it comes to showing
Gordon you're happy to be here.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.687
Here we go, lots of applause!

37:51.687 --> 37:54.189
And five, four,

37:54.189 --> 37:56.358
three...

37:56.358 --> 37:58.485
Ladies and gentlemen,

37:58.485 --> 38:01.029
it's <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

38:01.029 --> 38:03.115
Tonight's guests...

38:03.115 --> 38:05.534
astronaut Alan Shepard,

38:05.534 --> 38:09.162
Broadway sensation
Carol Burnett,

38:09.162 --> 38:11.957
<i>plus a special visit with...</i>

38:11.957 --> 38:14.042
<i>a Gordon Ford writer!</i>

38:14.042 --> 38:16.294
Now here he is,

38:16.294 --> 38:18.255
<i>Gordon Ford!</i>

38:18.255 --> 38:20.340
- Mr. Shepard?
- Okay, ready.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.385
- Good luck, Miss.
- Thank you.

38:23.385 --> 38:25.303
Nice to have you back on Earth.

39:23.153 --> 39:24.780
Midge?

39:24.780 --> 39:26.698
Hello, Midge? Are you Midge?

39:26.698 --> 39:28.408
That's Midge.

39:28.408 --> 39:30.118
Oh. Great. Thanks.

39:30.118 --> 39:32.662
Midge? Hi. I'm Plum. I know.

39:32.662 --> 39:34.456
It's a terrible fruity
family name, but there you go.

39:34.456 --> 39:35.707
Can we help you, Plum?

39:35.707 --> 39:37.542
No. I'm here to help you.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.669
I'm your stage manager
for the night.

39:39.669 --> 39:41.588
What do you mean,
"my stage manager"?

39:41.588 --> 39:43.590
The real stage manager is
busy managing the real show,

39:43.590 --> 39:45.300
so they assigned me
to manage you.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.552
Wait, don't you run the lost
and found for the ice rink?

39:47.552 --> 39:49.763

Just fantastic, Carol. Can't
wait to see what you do next.

40:23.797 --> 40:25.674
And we'll be right back,
ladies and gentlemen,

40:25.674 --> 40:28.176
after a word from our sponsor.

40:28.176 --> 40:31.012
And we are out.

40:31.012 --> 40:33.098
Wait here.

40:34.558 --> 40:36.560
All right, guys, right this way.

40:39.062 --> 40:40.939
You have to sit on a stool?

40:40.939 --> 40:42.566
The couch is right there.

40:42.566 --> 40:44.568
The couch is for the real
guests on the real show.

40:44.568 --> 40:46.361
I'm not allowed
to have back support.

40:46.361 --> 40:48.029
Well, the stool is
still on camera.

40:48.029 --> 40:49.823
You can still make them laugh.

40:49.823 --> 40:51.992
- This does not have to suck
completely, so tits...
- Nope.

40:51.992 --> 40:54.035
- Right.
- Girl writer
on the stool.

40:58.415 --> 41:00.500
You are on the left,
so Gordon can get back

41:00.500 --> 41:02.210
to his desk
as quickly as possible.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.212
Got it.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.801
Fine, thank you.

41:09.801 --> 41:12.220
Look at her up there.
Look, it's Miriam.

41:14.306 --> 41:16.474
Over here.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.019
Miriam, I found your mother!

41:19.019 --> 41:20.896
The phone was off the hook!

41:20.896 --> 41:22.439
I went home and got her!

41:22.439 --> 41:24.566
We took a bus! It was harrowing!

41:24.566 --> 41:26.526
Psst!

41:35.368 --> 41:37.829
And we're back in...

41:37.829 --> 41:40.498
five, four, three...

41:41.541 --> 41:43.960
♪ ♪

41:43.960 --> 41:46.713
And we're back,
ladies and gentlemen.

41:46.713 --> 41:50.133
This is <i>The Gordon Ford Show</i>
and I am still Gordon Ford.

41:50.133 --> 41:52.385
Now as much as I would love

41:52.385 --> 41:54.304
to take credit for everything
that happens out here,

41:54.304 --> 41:56.598
I can't. There is an army

41:56.598 --> 41:59.267
of men and women toiling away
in our offices back there,

41:59.267 --> 42:01.895
so that I can come out here
and appear witty.

42:01.895 --> 42:04.731
Well, I thought
that maybe you might want

42:04.731 --> 42:06.691
to meet one of them tonight.
Would you like that?

42:08.235 --> 42:10.153
So help me welcome
to <i>The Gordon Ford Show,</i>

42:10.153 --> 42:12.489
our resident lady writer.

42:18.161 --> 42:20.330
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet Midge.

42:21.831 --> 42:24.334
- Hello, Midge.
- Hello.

42:24.334 --> 42:26.795
Now you've been here
on the show five months now.

42:26.795 --> 42:28.797
So I've got to ask the question
everyone's thinking.

42:28.797 --> 42:31.675
In your own words,
what do you think of the boss?

42:33.718 --> 42:35.428
He's great, Gordon.

42:35.428 --> 42:37.055
- Handsome?
- Very.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.890
- Charming?
- Like the prince.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.684
Skillful juggler?
Good with kids?

42:40.684 --> 42:42.560
All of the above.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.438
Midge is one of six writers
on my writing staff.

42:45.438 --> 42:48.066
Now, you may all be wondering
what exactly is it

42:48.066 --> 42:49.651
that television writers do?

42:49.651 --> 42:51.736
Well, each morning, they gather
in the writers room,

42:51.736 --> 42:54.114
they have bagels and coffee,
they read the papers,

42:54.114 --> 42:55.949
they pretend to know
how to pass a football,

42:55.949 --> 42:57.951
and then just about now...

42:57.951 --> 42:59.953
they start thinking
of tonight's monologue.

42:59.953 --> 43:02.122
Always prepared, right?

43:02.122 --> 43:04.082
I can feel your eyes burning
a hole through my head.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.001
You're lucky I'm not staring
at your balls.

43:06.001 --> 43:08.295
So, Midge,
as our resident lady writer,

43:08.295 --> 43:10.672
let me ask you,
what's the difference

43:10.672 --> 43:12.882
between a male writer
and a female writer?

43:12.882 --> 43:15.176
Oh. Uh...

43:15.176 --> 43:16.553
While you think of that,
let's meet

43:16.553 --> 43:17.637
the rest of the writing staff.

43:17.637 --> 43:19.597
Jerry, turn that camera around.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.308
Ladies and gentlemen,
that's Ralph Emerson,

43:21.308 --> 43:23.184
Cecil Green, Adam Portnoy,

43:23.184 --> 43:24.811
Mel Rubens, and my head writer

43:24.811 --> 43:26.855
Alvin Blank. The writers
of <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

43:26.855 --> 43:28.523
My band of merry men.

43:28.523 --> 43:31.568
Hi! Hi!

43:31.568 --> 43:33.320
All right,
bring it back around on me.

43:33.320 --> 43:35.363
Okay, where were we?

43:35.363 --> 43:37.032
Oh, yes, the differences

43:37.032 --> 43:39.200
between male writers
and female writers.

43:39.200 --> 43:42.120
Female writers write a lot
more jokes about horses, Gordon.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.789
And poisoning our husbands.

43:44.789 --> 43:47.375
And we like
to be held after we pitch.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.002
Okay.

43:49.002 --> 43:50.879
And now a word from our sponsor.

43:50.879 --> 43:52.422
- What?
- What?

43:52.422 --> 43:54.215
- Go to commercial.
- What commercial?

43:54.215 --> 43:55.717
Find a commercial.

43:59.137 --> 44:00.930
♪ ♪

44:00.930 --> 44:02.724
That's it?

44:02.724 --> 44:05.477
Leave 'em wanting more.

44:07.604 --> 44:08.772
And we are
out for commercial,

ladies and gentlemen.

44:09.939 --> 44:11.858
Stay on the stool.
What are you doing?

44:11.858 --> 44:13.610
- You still have four minutes
left on the bit.
- The bit was done.

44:13.610 --> 44:15.111
- I threw to commercial.
- I know you threw
to commercial.

44:15.111 --> 44:16.780
You weren't supposed
to throw to commercial.

44:16.780 --> 44:18.406
- Not for another
four minutes.
- So I threw early.

44:18.406 --> 44:19.949
Four minutes early!

44:19.949 --> 44:21.826
Look, I'll just wrap the show
after the commercial.

You have four minutes

I know I keep saying it.

44:26.206 --> 44:28.208

44:30.585 --> 44:32.629
I want four minutes from you.
Content!

44:32.629 --> 44:34.672
Bring out another writer.
Interview the stage manager.

44:34.672 --> 44:37.425
Interview Plum. What the hell
is Plum doing here?

44:37.425 --> 44:39.260
They never go
to commercial this early.

44:39.260 --> 44:41.471
They have three minutes
and 56 seconds

44:41.471 --> 44:43.848
left in this segment.
I time it.

44:48.520 --> 44:50.021
What the hell
is she doing on a stool?

44:50.021 --> 44:52.399
- Everything backfired.
- What did you do?

44:52.399 --> 44:55.193
Why is everything automatically
my...? Yeah, okay, it was me.

44:55.193 --> 44:56.694
I had a friend talk Gordon

44:56.694 --> 44:58.405
into putting her on the show
and since he's

44:58.405 --> 45:01.366
a baby driven solely by his ego
and paper-thin nutsack,

45:01.366 --> 45:03.660
he bumped her from
a stand-up spot to the stool.

45:03.660 --> 45:05.620
And then she gets a laugh
from the audience,

45:05.620 --> 45:08.331
so my guess is
he shit his diaper.

45:08.331 --> 45:09.749
Fine.

45:09.749 --> 45:12.085
I will do four more minutes
of stool work. Happy?

45:12.085 --> 45:13.670
She's funny, Gordon.

45:13.670 --> 45:15.213
You're the one who hired her
in the first place.

45:15.213 --> 45:17.340
Because you thought
she was funny.

45:18.758 --> 45:20.427
Four more minutes
after commercial.

45:20.427 --> 45:22.053
- But...
- Midge, please.

45:22.053 --> 45:24.347
Four more minutes,
and then we can all go get drunk

45:24.347 --> 45:26.891
or go to bed
or drive a car into a wall.

45:26.891 --> 45:29.310
- Might do all three, myself.
- Fine.

45:29.310 --> 45:31.271
Thank you.

45:31.271 --> 45:32.856
- Archie, I'm here!
- Finally!

45:32.856 --> 45:34.441
I know. Did I miss it?
What did she do?

45:34.441 --> 45:36.025
- She sat on a stool.
- Oh, good.

45:36.025 --> 45:38.278
She can do that.
Hi. We're married.

45:43.324 --> 45:45.660
- Miriam! Miriam!
- Miriam, over here!

45:52.041 --> 45:54.669
Miriam, I have to say,
though not a word

45:54.669 --> 45:56.463
of any note has come
out of your mouth,

45:56.463 --> 45:58.339
it is still very exciting

45:58.339 --> 46:00.341
to see you sitting
on that stool.

46:00.341 --> 46:02.886
Thank you, Papa.

46:02.886 --> 46:05.180
Miriam.

46:05.180 --> 46:07.682
You know you can get pregnant
squatting like that.

46:07.682 --> 46:09.476
I told you that one time,

46:09.476 --> 46:10.977
and you've never
let me forget it.

46:10.977 --> 46:12.270
Because it was a doozy.

46:12.270 --> 46:14.397
I just want you to know,
I'm very touched

46:14.397 --> 46:17.317
that you had so many people
ask me to come here tonight.

46:17.317 --> 46:20.236
Well, it was supposed
to be a big night for me.

46:20.236 --> 46:21.863
I didn't want you to miss it.

46:21.863 --> 46:23.281
Supposed to be?

46:23.281 --> 46:24.699
Is.

46:24.699 --> 46:26.534
It is a big night for me.

46:26.534 --> 46:28.119
Um...

46:28.119 --> 46:29.996
they want you back in place?

46:29.996 --> 46:31.831
Is that a question, Plum?

46:31.831 --> 46:33.917
No.

46:35.502 --> 46:37.420
I'll see you later, Mama.

46:37.420 --> 46:39.255
Midge!

46:39.255 --> 46:41.716
Beret!

46:41.716 --> 46:43.843
And we're back
in two minutes, everyone.

46:43.843 --> 46:46.221
Please stay in your seats.

47:20.922 --> 47:21.923
We can fight
about this tomorrow.

47:21.923 --> 47:23.007
I mean, it's for four more...

47:23.007 --> 47:24.592
Stool, stool, stool.

47:24.592 --> 47:26.010
Mike, can I talk
to Susie for a second?

47:26.010 --> 47:27.804
One second. One literal second.

47:27.804 --> 47:29.556
What's going on?
Are you thinking?

47:29.556 --> 47:31.140
'Cause it looks like you're
thinking or passing a stone.

47:31.140 --> 47:32.850
Susie, I have
four more minutes left.

47:32.850 --> 47:34.894
- Four minutes.
- Okay.

47:34.894 --> 47:37.105
Four minutes. You hearing me?

47:37.105 --> 47:39.440
- Yes. Four minutes.
- Four minutes.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.234
- Four minutes.
You've got four minutes.
- Four.

47:41.234 --> 47:43.903
I am gonna punch you
in the nose. I don't care how

47:43.903 --> 47:45.947
- it will look on TV.
- I'm thinking
about doing something,

47:45.947 --> 47:47.407
Susie, something reckless
that could go

47:47.407 --> 47:49.576
very badly for both of us.

47:49.576 --> 47:50.743
Yeah?

47:50.743 --> 47:52.161
It could ruin us.

47:52.161 --> 47:54.330
Definitely me
and you by extension.

47:55.373 --> 47:56.833
Okay.

47:56.833 --> 47:59.085
I just...

47:59.085 --> 48:00.670
60 seconds.

48:06.759 --> 48:08.428
What do you think?

48:10.138 --> 48:12.390
Look, you started your career
by getting up on a stage

48:12.390 --> 48:14.309
that no one told you to get up
on, saying a bunch of shit

48:14.309 --> 48:16.978
that no one wanted you
to say, so...

48:16.978 --> 48:19.439
...tits up.

48:20.607 --> 48:22.817
Tits up.

48:29.449 --> 48:31.451
Buckle up, Mikey.

48:34.787 --> 48:36.039
30 seconds.

48:36.039 --> 48:38.333
Everybody back
in their seats, please.

48:45.048 --> 48:48.051
I want you to know it was not
my intention to force your hand.

48:48.051 --> 48:50.887
I had hoped you would want
to put me on someday.

48:50.887 --> 48:53.598
This isn't personal,
it's just...

48:55.308 --> 48:57.226
- It was not handled well.
- Mm-hmm.

48:57.226 --> 48:59.312
- And you know the rule.
- I do.

48:59.312 --> 49:01.272
And we are back

49:01.272 --> 49:03.316
in five, four, three...

49:03.316 --> 49:05.610
I've just never been great
at following rules.

49:12.867 --> 49:15.453
We are back
with our lady writer.

49:15.453 --> 49:17.455
So, Midge,
something's been nagging at me

49:17.455 --> 49:18.831
ever since you came aboard.

49:18.831 --> 49:20.750
The coffee
in the writers' room is

49:20.750 --> 49:23.336
so much better than
in the break room, why is that?

49:23.336 --> 49:26.130
I wouldn't know, Gordon,
because-- fun fact--

49:26.130 --> 49:28.049
I am not actually a writer.

49:28.049 --> 49:29.967
What?

49:29.967 --> 49:32.845
I'm a comedienne. I've only
been pretending to be a writer

49:32.845 --> 49:34.597
so I'd have a bathroom
to use in Midtown.

49:35.973 --> 49:37.350
So, why don't
I just get up and do

49:37.350 --> 49:39.018
what I came here to do, huh?

49:44.691 --> 49:46.776
No, where are you going?

49:46.776 --> 49:48.111
We'll find out.

49:52.573 --> 49:54.742
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

49:54.742 --> 49:57.912
What's happening here
is a Jewish hijacking.

49:57.912 --> 50:01.165
There's no planes involved,
no one wants to go to Cuba.

50:01.165 --> 50:03.459
My only demand is
four minutes of airtime,

50:03.459 --> 50:05.002
and a ride to the doctor
when I'm old.

50:06.671 --> 50:07.839
That's the nice thing
about the Jews.

50:07.839 --> 50:09.340
We only hijack a conversation.

50:11.592 --> 50:14.053
So, I am not actually supposed
to be up here right now,

50:14.053 --> 50:17.140
talking to you all.
I broke a pretty big rule

50:17.140 --> 50:18.975
when I left that stool.

50:18.975 --> 50:20.101
But lately, I've been doing

50:20.101 --> 50:21.394
a lot of things
I'm not supposed to.

50:21.394 --> 50:23.521
Like becoming a comic.
That was a surprise.

50:23.521 --> 50:26.274
To everyone. Me, especially.

50:26.274 --> 50:28.234
I was just a wife and a mother

50:28.234 --> 50:29.819
on the Upper West Side...

50:29.819 --> 50:31.946
Upper West Side? Really?

50:31.946 --> 50:34.365
My parents are
in the audience tonight.

50:34.365 --> 50:36.200
Compare notes on
the parking situation.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.411
My father's got a whole
conspiracy theory going on...

50:38.411 --> 50:40.079
It's not a theory.

50:40.079 --> 50:41.748
There's a lot of Jews
on the Upper West Side

50:41.748 --> 50:44.250
and not nearly enough parking
spaces. Connect the dots.

50:44.250 --> 50:46.127
...so I was just
a wife and a mother

50:46.127 --> 50:47.754
and then one day,
my husband left me.

50:48.796 --> 50:50.381
On Yom Kippur.

50:50.381 --> 50:53.050
The holy day when Jews fast
to atone for their sins?

50:53.050 --> 50:54.886
That's the day
he chose to leave me.

50:54.886 --> 50:57.680
For his secretary.

50:57.680 --> 50:58.723
I can't really blame him, though.

50:58.723 --> 50:59.849
She had some mints in her purse.

51:02.101 --> 51:04.854
I'll admit, it was
really terrible for a while.

51:04.854 --> 51:06.981
But then the sun set
and I could eat again.

51:08.900 --> 51:10.777
Suddenly, I was single.

51:10.777 --> 51:12.653
I wasn't raised to be single.

51:12.653 --> 51:15.448
I didn't know what to do, so I
drank my weight in Manischewitz,

51:15.448 --> 51:17.867
stumbled onto a stage,
grabbed a microphone,

51:17.867 --> 51:20.411
and in that moment
everything changed.

51:20.411 --> 51:23.372
I discovered what it felt like
to have people listen to me.

51:23.372 --> 51:26.125
Well, not men, but other people.

51:26.125 --> 51:28.336
Well, not my mother,
but everybody else.

51:28.336 --> 51:31.047
Okay, not my children, my dates,

51:31.047 --> 51:33.841
employers, coworkers,
the new butcher,

51:33.841 --> 51:35.968
but strangers.
Strangers love me.

51:39.263 --> 51:41.265
Yeah.

51:43.851 --> 51:45.686
How the hell did you get there?

51:45.686 --> 51:47.980
I'm magic.

51:47.980 --> 51:49.982
Actually,
I should be grateful

51:49.982 --> 51:52.193
that my husband cheated
with the person that he did.

51:52.193 --> 51:54.237
Because she was, as they say

51:54.237 --> 51:55.988
in the <i>American Journal
of Medicine,</i>

51:55.988 --> 51:57.573
an idiot.

51:57.573 --> 51:59.742
And I'm not just saying
that because she slept

51:59.742 --> 52:01.911
with my husband. I'm saying
that because I saw her

52:01.911 --> 52:03.788
ask a plastic plant
in the office

52:03.788 --> 52:05.206
if it wanted some water.

52:05.206 --> 52:07.917
And then waited for an answer.

52:07.917 --> 52:09.627
For ten full minutes.

52:09.627 --> 52:11.337
And then went to the coffeepot

52:11.337 --> 52:12.880
and asked
why the plant was mad at her.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.674
So when your husband
leaves you for that,

52:14.674 --> 52:16.759
it softens the blow.

52:16.759 --> 52:19.136
It feels good that after their
first cocktail party appearance,

52:19.136 --> 52:21.180
people call you saying,
"What was he thinking?

52:21.180 --> 52:22.974
She apologized to the ashtray

52:22.974 --> 52:24.433
every time
she put out a cigarette."

52:24.433 --> 52:26.519
Did you do that?

52:26.519 --> 52:28.187
- We did.
- From the party.

52:28.187 --> 52:29.647
I've been single
for a while now.

52:29.647 --> 52:32.358
Quite a while.

52:32.358 --> 52:34.193
If I ever do remarry,
my mother's going to have

52:34.193 --> 52:37.238
to give me "the talk" again
to refresh my memory.

52:37.238 --> 52:40.283
I'm actually not sure if
a permanent relationship is even

52:40.283 --> 52:42.493
in the cards for me anymore.

52:42.493 --> 52:44.370
I mean, I work at night.

52:44.370 --> 52:46.831
I come home reeking
of cigarettes and booze

52:46.831 --> 52:49.834
with lipstick
on my collar... mine.

52:49.834 --> 52:52.920
And the men in my life are
no longer boyfriends or lovers.

52:52.920 --> 52:55.298
They're bits. Fodder for my act.

52:55.298 --> 52:58.217
If they kiss loud
or have nicknames

52:58.217 --> 53:00.887
for their body parts...
like their feet.

53:00.887 --> 53:03.014
Come on, we sell soap here.

53:04.348 --> 53:05.892
If we have
an argument on a Friday,

53:05.892 --> 53:08.019
Saturday night I'm recreating it
for the Shriners,

53:08.019 --> 53:10.605
who are always on my side
and think I can do better.

53:10.605 --> 53:13.524
Plus I come with kids. Two.

53:13.524 --> 53:15.192
A boy and a girl.

53:15.192 --> 53:17.278
Their names are
on the tip of my tongue.

53:18.321 --> 53:20.698
We're a Jewish household,
so my son was circumcised

53:20.698 --> 53:22.491
a week after he was born.

53:22.491 --> 53:24.744
My daughter's trauma will have
to wait until she's old enough

53:24.744 --> 53:27.496
to go clothes shopping
with my mother.

53:27.496 --> 53:29.081
Well, that's fair.

53:29.081 --> 53:31.083
I do know
that because of my situation,

53:31.083 --> 53:34.337
my daughter is going to grow up
different than I did.

53:34.337 --> 53:36.213
She's gonna be tougher.

53:36.213 --> 53:38.633
More independent.
That's a terrifying word.

53:38.633 --> 53:40.635
Independent.

53:40.635 --> 53:42.470
Especially for women.

53:42.470 --> 53:44.847
It was not a word we were
supposed to be familiar with.

53:44.847 --> 53:47.516
I wasn't. My mother wasn't.

53:47.516 --> 53:49.393
But I'm on my own now.

53:49.393 --> 53:51.562
So if I want
that flat tire changed...

53:51.562 --> 53:53.606
well, clearly someone else
is gonna do it.

53:53.606 --> 53:55.274
I'm independent, not an idiot.

53:55.274 --> 53:58.277
I haven't talked
to a plastic plant in months.

54:00.446 --> 54:03.824
My kids, God, I promise
their names will come to me.

54:04.909 --> 54:06.744
I think it's inevitable
that they will hate me

54:06.744 --> 54:07.912
when they grow up.

54:07.912 --> 54:10.247
Like every other parent,
I spend sleepless nights

54:10.247 --> 54:11.916
imagining what my kids
are gonna say about me

54:11.916 --> 54:13.334
to their psychiatrists.

54:13.334 --> 54:15.127
Right? You've done this.

54:15.127 --> 54:16.462
"She wasn't home."

54:16.462 --> 54:18.381
"She missed my baseball game."

54:18.381 --> 54:20.132
"She made me listen
to her tight ten for a week

54:20.132 --> 54:22.134
before she opened in Toledo
and then had us heckle her

54:22.134 --> 54:25.054
for three hours so she had
some practiced comebacks.

54:25.054 --> 54:26.764
And our drinks
were watered-down."

54:30.726 --> 54:33.646
That's why I need
to get really famous.

54:33.646 --> 54:36.607
If you're really famous,
everybody loves you.

54:36.607 --> 54:38.943
At least until the will is read.

54:38.943 --> 54:41.946
I heard a story
about Mary Martin,

54:41.946 --> 54:44.198
Broadway star.
Her driver got sick,

54:44.198 --> 54:46.701
so she had to take a cab to the
theater she was performing at.

54:46.701 --> 54:49.370
She gets in, cabbie asks her
where she's going.

54:49.370 --> 54:51.455
She has no idea.

54:51.455 --> 54:54.166
No idea where the theater is
or what it's called.

54:54.166 --> 54:57.670
She is too famous to know.

54:57.670 --> 54:59.255
She is so famous
that, eventually,

54:59.255 --> 55:01.173
someone will notice she's
missing and just come find her.

55:01.173 --> 55:03.342
All she has to do
is stand still.

55:04.719 --> 55:06.721
That's the kind of fame I want.

55:06.721 --> 55:09.682
Where I never have to know
who I am or where I'm going.

55:09.682 --> 55:11.934
Where one day Bob Hope
walks up to me at a restaurant

55:11.934 --> 55:13.144
and says, "Hi, I'm Bob Hope.

55:13.144 --> 55:14.562
You probably
don't remember meeting me,"

55:14.562 --> 55:16.313
and I say, "Of course I do.
I'll have the chicken."

55:21.110 --> 55:23.779
I want a big life.

55:23.779 --> 55:25.990
I want to experience everything.

55:25.990 --> 55:29.160
I want to break
every single rule there is.

55:30.327 --> 55:33.289
They say ambition is an
unattractive trait in a woman.

55:33.289 --> 55:34.957
Maybe.

55:34.957 --> 55:37.543
But you know
what's really unattractive?

55:37.543 --> 55:40.212
Waiting around
for something to happen.

55:40.212 --> 55:42.715
Staring out a window, thinking
the life you should be living

55:42.715 --> 55:44.592
is out there somewhere
but not being willing

55:44.592 --> 55:46.093
to open the door and go get it.

55:46.093 --> 55:48.846
Even if someone tells you
you can't.

55:48.846 --> 55:52.058
Being a coward is only cute
in <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

55:53.476 --> 55:56.228
Ethan and Esther. I knew
it would come to me eventually.

55:56.228 --> 55:57.813
Oh!

55:57.813 --> 55:59.482
Huh.

56:05.529 --> 56:07.531
Yeah.

56:10.159 --> 56:13.579
You have been
an amazing audience!

56:13.579 --> 56:15.247
I want to thank you,

56:15.247 --> 56:17.333
I want to thank Gordon Ford,

56:17.333 --> 56:20.211
and, most importantly,
I want to thank Bergdorf Goodman

56:20.211 --> 56:22.129
from the bottom of my heart.

56:22.129 --> 56:25.174
Thank you and good night!

56:30.513 --> 56:33.182
I just wish
she'd worn a different dress.

56:33.182 --> 56:36.602
You did it,
Midge, whoo!

56:42.566 --> 56:44.360
- Holy shit.
- Holy shit.

56:44.360 --> 56:47.071
Well, don't just stand there!
Get over here, Maisel. Let's go!

56:53.202 --> 56:54.745
- Wow.
- Look at her.

57:01.335 --> 57:02.670
Ah!

57:02.670 --> 57:04.672
Sit down.

57:04.672 --> 57:06.674
Right now.

57:06.674 --> 57:07.925
Whew.

57:10.094 --> 57:12.847
Whew.

57:12.847 --> 57:15.349
Where on earth
did that come from?

57:15.349 --> 57:17.768
It was always there, Gordon.
You just had to ask.

57:17.768 --> 57:19.854
Oh. Well,
that was just terrific.

57:19.854 --> 57:22.106
Really great. And I have to say,
I agree with you.

57:22.106 --> 57:24.066
You are definitely
not a writer.

57:25.109 --> 57:27.862
That is the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

57:28.904 --> 57:31.407
I have been hoist
by my own petard, folks.

57:31.407 --> 57:34.410
I knew this lady was funny
but I did not know how funny.

57:34.410 --> 57:36.662
I'm just grateful
you didn't turn the cameras off.

57:36.662 --> 57:38.414
Oh, we did.
You can recreate it, can't you?

57:38.414 --> 57:40.332
Absolutely. Mm-hmm.

57:40.332 --> 57:43.335
Folks, I don't actually think
you got a proper introduction

57:43.335 --> 57:46.172
to this very,
very funny lady here.

57:46.172 --> 57:47.756
And I am gonna remedy that
right now.

57:47.756 --> 57:49.508
Ladies and gentlemen,
making her first

57:49.508 --> 57:51.135
but definitely not last

57:51.135 --> 57:53.262
appearance
on <i>The Gordon Ford Show,</i>

57:53.262 --> 57:55.848
may I present the magnificent,

57:55.848 --> 57:57.266
the magical,

57:57.266 --> 58:00.144
the marvelous Mrs. Maisel.

58:06.525 --> 58:09.445
There she is.
That's my daughter.

58:09.445 --> 58:11.655
- That's my ex-wife.
- That's my best friend's
ex-wife.

58:11.655 --> 58:13.657
That's my ex-wife!

58:35.554 --> 58:37.306
You're fired.

59:01.872 --> 59:03.374
<i>♪ Doop-doo-de-doop ♪</i>

59:03.374 --> 59:05.584
<i>♪ Doo-de-doop,
doo-de-doo-de-doop ♪</i>

59:05.584 --> 59:07.127
<i>♪ Doop-doo-de-doop ♪</i>

59:07.127 --> 59:09.546
<i>♪ Doo-de-doop,
doo-de-doo-de-doop...</i>

59:09.546 --> 59:12.132
Yeah, remember, indecipherable.

59:12.132 --> 59:13.550
This makes no sense.

59:13.550 --> 59:15.135
Do you want me to teach you
how to be famous or not?

59:15.135 --> 59:16.679
After you learn, maybe.

59:16.679 --> 59:18.681
Okay, this is not the behavior
of someone who's been eating

59:18.681 --> 59:20.307
gratis salt and pepper shrimp
all night.

59:20.307 --> 59:21.767
But if someone asks
for your autograph,

59:21.767 --> 59:23.185
they should be able
to read your name.

59:23.185 --> 59:24.603
No. Wrong.

59:24.603 --> 59:26.730
If they can read your name,
they will feel cheated.

59:26.730 --> 59:28.732
They will know you are real.
That you went to school.

59:28.732 --> 59:29.900
That you can write a check.

59:29.900 --> 59:31.318
Okay. Here.

59:31.318 --> 59:32.403
What do you think?

59:32.403 --> 59:33.487
What's this?

59:33.487 --> 59:34.738
My autograph.

59:34.738 --> 59:36.282
I see at least three letters
very clearly.

59:36.282 --> 59:37.366
Again.

59:39.410 --> 59:41.078
Who taught you how to be famous?

59:41.078 --> 59:42.538
I was born famous.

59:42.538 --> 59:43.622
I see.

59:43.622 --> 59:45.249
I floated down the Nile
in a basket

59:45.249 --> 59:47.459
stuffed with greasepaint
and a copy of the trades.

59:47.459 --> 59:48.502
That's a terrific story.

59:48.502 --> 59:50.004
I made it up myself.

59:50.004 --> 59:52.840
You want to hear the one
about the tap dancing locusts?

59:52.840 --> 59:54.174
You want anything else?

59:54.174 --> 59:55.509
Is there anything else?

59:55.509 --> 59:57.720
Just the check.

59:57.720 --> 59:59.096
Thank you for the feast.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:00.139
You're welcome.

01:00:00.139 --> 01:00:02.057
It's been a great night.

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:03.726
I concur.

01:00:03.726 --> 01:00:05.019
Is it still snowing?

01:00:05.019 --> 01:00:08.147
Well, if it is...

01:00:08.147 --> 01:00:09.732
there won't be any cabs.

01:00:09.732 --> 01:00:11.400
Trains will be spotty.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.402
You might have to seek shelter
somewhere nearby

01:00:13.402 --> 01:00:14.737
until it clears up.

01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:16.905
I already sought shelter earlier,

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:18.782
and now I have to go
to confession in the morning.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.701
Last booth on the left
knows Hebrew.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:25.998
Well? What about this?

01:00:25.998 --> 01:00:27.124
Oh, nice.

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:29.335
- That's practically Sanskrit.
- Ah!

01:00:29.335 --> 01:00:30.502
Okay, now we should work

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:32.296
on ignoring people
who you obviously know

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:34.048
when they're standing
two feet away from you.

01:00:34.048 --> 01:00:35.632
All the famous people do it.

01:00:37.051 --> 01:00:39.470
What makes you so sure
I'm gonna be really famous?

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:41.638
Mm, it's just a hunch.

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:44.224
I've seen your act.

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:46.018
I watched you escape
a police raid.

01:00:46.018 --> 01:00:48.062
So, running and talking.

01:00:48.062 --> 01:00:50.397
You have many skills.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:52.608
Think my show corset
turned your head.

01:00:52.608 --> 01:00:55.027
My head turned a long time ago.

01:00:55.027 --> 01:00:57.446
It's why I keep pulling
to the right.

01:00:57.446 --> 01:00:59.531
I don't know.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:02.368
I hope you're right
because I don't have a plan B.

01:01:02.368 --> 01:01:04.828
All my eggs
are in one big basket.

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:06.080
Mm, allow me.

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:08.707
God, I love a man
who steals my food.

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:13.128
"A spotlight waits
for you center stage.

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:15.964
All you have to do
is step up and claim it."

01:01:15.964 --> 01:01:17.341
- Wow.
- "Once you do,

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:19.301
everyone will know who you are.

01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:21.220
They will know your wit,

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.847
your intellect, your smile.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:26.266
Your great, expressive eyes."

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:29.353
"They will be helpless
to your charms."

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:31.647
That must be
some very small writing.

01:01:31.647 --> 01:01:33.232
"They will fall at your feet

01:01:33.232 --> 01:01:36.443
and worship at the altar
of you and your show corset."

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:37.778
Can I see that fortune?

01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:38.862
Oh, no.
If someone sees you can read,

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.447
they'll never let you be famous.

01:01:44.368 --> 01:01:46.703
"Your lucky numbers are 46,

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:49.957
24, 11, six and five."

01:01:49.957 --> 01:01:51.542
It's all how you read it.

01:01:54.253 --> 01:01:56.004
You mark my words.

01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:59.216
Very soon,
in the not too distant future,

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:01.885
you will be paying
for the Chinese food.

01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:16.483
<i>The week of the 24th,</i>

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:18.068
<i>you go to Orlando
and Palm Beach.</i>

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:19.736
<i>Those dates are firm.
Then you have</i>

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.656
Chicago, Minneapolis and
possibly Vegas for two weeks.

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:24.741
So far apart. All that travel.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:26.285
Charo offered her plane.

01:02:26.285 --> 01:02:27.578
Oh, well, that's fine, then.

01:02:27.578 --> 01:02:28.579
What about the Palace?

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:29.788
We are working on the Palace.

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:31.081
They're still talking December.

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.791
I don't want to be in London
for the holidays.

01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:34.626
- I know that.
- I want to be in New York
for the holidays.

01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:36.378
We have relayed the message.

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:38.005
I'm never in New York for
the holidays, and this year

01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:39.298
I want to be in New York
for the holidays.

01:02:39.298 --> 01:02:40.340
I hear you.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.884
New York for the holidays. Period.

01:02:41.884 --> 01:02:43.135
However, if that's the only time
that works,

01:02:43.135 --> 01:02:44.261
then December's fine.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:45.596
The building says there's
nothing they can do

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:47.431
- about the noise.
- They've been jumping around

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:48.515
for hours down there.

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:50.184
It's like Ruby Keeler moved in.

01:02:50.184 --> 01:02:51.477
I'll knock on the door
and see what's up.

01:02:51.477 --> 01:02:52.686
Tell them Yoko's complaining.

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:53.854
That'll shut 'em up.

01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:55.022
Now,

01:02:55.022 --> 01:02:56.732
before we break, what am I doing
on Tuesday?

01:02:56.732 --> 01:02:58.108
Nothing.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.651
Oh.

01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:01.361
- Well, are we working
on booking something?
- No.

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:03.322
But you are working Sunday,
Monday and Wednesday, though.

01:03:03.322 --> 01:03:04.323
Traveling Thursday.

01:03:04.323 --> 01:03:05.782
But what about Tuesday?

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:07.618
You can rest on Tuesday.

01:03:09.244 --> 01:03:11.580
Let me make some calls.

01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:14.458
You press here,
bring up the menu,

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:16.126
scroll over
to the envelope icon, click,

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:18.045
- then write your message.
- Why don't I just call them?

01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:19.254
Sometimes you want to text.

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:20.339
- When?
- When you're late.

01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:21.507
I can call when I'm late.

01:03:21.507 --> 01:03:22.925
It's just a fun thing
your phone can do.

01:03:22.925 --> 01:03:24.843
- Like take pictures.
- My camera takes pictures.

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:25.844
What if you don't have
your camera?

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.054
I commit it to memory.

01:03:27.054 --> 01:03:28.347
It also takes videos.

01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:29.556
Does it have the nuclear codes?

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:31.058
- Can I bomb somebody?
- No, you can't.

01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:32.684
What about aliens?
Can I communicate with aliens?

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:34.520
Not with the phone. Can I just
show you how to write a message?

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.022
- You can certainly try.
- So you scroll down to a number
and then you click

01:03:37.022 --> 01:03:38.524
on that number until it goes
to the letter you want

01:03:38.524 --> 01:03:40.234
- and then...
- Enjoy the phone, Franklin!

01:05:47.778 --> 01:05:50.781
Uh, the fucking cleaning lady
moved everything around.

01:05:50.781 --> 01:05:52.616

<i>Box on the flower table.</i>

01:05:58.038 --> 01:06:00.040
You don't know everything!

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.292
<i>She didn't move them.
She never moves them.</i>

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:03.960
- <i>Look in the box
on the flower table.</i>
- You know,

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.089
a whole continent away from you
is not enough space.

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:10.425
<i>Did you find them?</i>

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:12.427
No.

01:06:12.427 --> 01:06:14.262
Did your machine tape it okay?

01:06:14.262 --> 01:06:15.806
<i>Yes. I got it fixed.</i>

01:06:15.806 --> 01:06:16.807
Did you check it?

01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:18.892
<i>I checked it. It works.</i>

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:21.603
<i>Now, remind me,
what happened yesterday?</i>

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:24.106
Oh. Uh, they booted the guy

01:06:24.106 --> 01:06:27.359
who didn't know which character
Danny Bonaduce played

01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:28.610
on <i>The Partridge Family.</i>

01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:30.278
<i>Well, I wouldn't
have known that.</i>

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:33.240
It's Danny. Jesus Christ.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.324
All right, you got it?

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.784
I got it. You got it?

01:06:35.784 --> 01:06:36.910
I got it.

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:38.078
I'm putting it in.

01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:39.371
I'm putting it in.

01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:41.540
- <i>Still putting it in.</i>
- I'm in.

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:44.209
- I'm in!
- <i>Now, don't press

01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:46.086
Every fucking time.

01:06:46.086 --> 01:06:48.755
Because we have to hear
the answers at the same time.

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:49.756
<i>I know!</i>

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:50.757
And if you get ahead,

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:52.384
then you hear the answer
before I do.

01:06:52.384 --> 01:06:54.553
I fucking know!

01:06:54.553 --> 01:06:56.388
We'll press it at the same time.

01:06:56.388 --> 01:06:58.056
Jesus.

01:06:58.056 --> 01:06:59.725
Could've watched the whole show
by now.

01:06:59.725 --> 01:07:02.519
Oh! Susie, did you get my bird?

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:04.354
The red one?

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:05.522
She's gorgeous.

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:07.357
I've never seen anything
like her.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.484
I named her Whore.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:11.027
<i>I didn't thank you for that?</i>

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.946
You're welcome. You ready?

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:14.948
I am ready.

01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:16.450
Okay, one,

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:18.535
two, three,

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:19.703
- <i>go.</i>
- Go.

01:07:22.164 --> 01:07:23.665
Such a pleasant tune.

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:26.209
Mm, really pleasant tune.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:29.212
<i>The Ultimate
Tournament of Champions.</i>

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:31.673
<i>Will it be a retail specialist</i>

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:33.592
<i>from Louisville, Kentucky,
Chris Miller,</i>

01:07:33.592 --> 01:07:36.511
<i>who, yesterday, won $10,000?</i>

01:07:36.511 --> 01:07:37.888
An investment analyst...

01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:39.973
They had a meeting here
and we're going over dates

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:42.642
and I look down.
Tuesday's empty.

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:43.769
Oops.

01:07:43.769 --> 01:07:45.520
- Feel sorry for Delia.
- <i>I mean,</i>

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.688
it's wide open, Susie.

01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:47.689
And when I questioned it,

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:49.107
she looked at me
like I'm insane.

01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:50.942
You want me
to call her?

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:53.278
<i>I want you to come back to work.</i>

01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:55.197
I've done my time.

01:07:55.197 --> 01:07:56.698
I'll call her tomorrow.

01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:58.492
I think
I'm gonna take the champ.

01:07:58.492 --> 01:07:59.951
Okay. I got bushy beard man.

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:01.995
<i>Here we go,
the Jeopardy! round.</i>

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:03.538
Gonna be a good match.

01:08:03.538 --> 01:08:05.540
Should we make it
a little more interesting?

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.542
It's been interesting
for 45 years.

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:09.252
I'm not sure
how we're gonna top it now.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:10.545
<i>Let's do...</i>

01:08:10.545 --> 01:08:12.547
Forbes' <i>Billionaires, $200.</i>

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:14.591
<i>March was
a great month for her:</i>

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:16.218
<i>she made her debut
on the</i> Forbes <i>list...</i>

01:08:16.218 --> 01:08:17.219
- Martha Stewart.
- <i>Oh. The chick who went</i>

01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:18.929
to jail 'cause she's a broad,

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:20.764
even though every other guy
who does the same fucking thing

01:08:20.764 --> 01:08:22.307
is walking around
completely free.

01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:23.308
<i>- Who is Martha Stewart?
- Yes.</i>

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:24.434
<i>Billionaires for $600.</i>

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:26.269
I think
he would've given me that one.

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:27.687
<i>...but
this septuagenarian</i>

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:29.898
<i>member of the Disney family
is still on it.</i>

01:08:29.898 --> 01:08:31.316
<i>- John?
- Who is Roy Disney?</i>

01:08:31.316 --> 01:08:33.109
- <i>Roy Disney.</i>
- Oh, he's a nice man.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.820
<i>- Predators for $600.
- Are we gonna keep...</i>

01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:36.571
How do you think
I'd look in a goatee?

01:08:36.571 --> 01:08:38.073
<i>Why would that
even occur to you?</i>

01:08:38.073 --> 01:08:39.825
Well, if there is reincarnation,

01:08:39.825 --> 01:08:42.369
I could come back as a man
and I want to have a look.

01:08:42.369 --> 01:08:44.287
- <i>Are you bald?</i>
- Why?

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:45.789
Because I think if you're bald,

01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:48.333
it's weird if all the hair
you have is under your chin.

01:08:48.333 --> 01:08:50.502
Hmm? Goatee looks better
with a full head of hair.

01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:51.837
<i>That is ridiculous.</i>

01:08:51.837 --> 01:08:52.879
That is ridiculous?

01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:54.256
Not this entire conversation?

01:08:54.256 --> 01:08:56.466
You don't ever imagine
what you'd come back as

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:58.134
- if you came back?
- <i>No.</i>

01:08:58.134 --> 01:08:59.845
<i>I still have all my marbles.</i>

01:08:59.845 --> 01:09:01.805
I think about it all the time.

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:03.640
Who would I be?
Where would I live?

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.600
- <i>What if I was an animal?</i>
- Oh, boy.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.435
I think I'd make
a cute squirrel.

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:08.687
Or a swan.

01:09:08.687 --> 01:09:10.355
Or a wild mustang.

01:09:10.355 --> 01:09:12.691
I'd be a great wild mustang.
What about you?

01:09:12.691 --> 01:09:14.609
I am not coming back
as anything.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:15.735
<i>Come on.</i>

01:09:15.735 --> 01:09:17.612
I am fine being dead.
I prefer it.

01:09:17.612 --> 01:09:19.197
Any animal, what would you be?

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:23.285
- Skunk.
- <i>Why?</i>

01:09:23.285 --> 01:09:25.120
Mm, great fur. Cute face.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.413
And your ass is a weapon.

01:09:26.413 --> 01:09:28.331
That does seem
like you.

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:29.374
<i>Right?</i>

01:09:29.374 --> 01:09:31.418
Walking down the street,
someone bumps me,

01:09:31.418 --> 01:09:33.545
turn, tail up... bam!

01:09:33.545 --> 01:09:35.422
- I can picture it.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:09:35.422 --> 01:09:37.757
And I look back over my shoulder
while I do it.

01:09:37.757 --> 01:09:39.593
And you're wearing your cap.

01:09:40.677 --> 01:09:41.845
That's right, buddy.

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:43.305
That smell? That's you.

01:09:43.305 --> 01:09:45.348
Enjoy your tomato juice bath.

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:48.059
Tomato juice bath.

01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:50.395
Yeah, throw-throw
a celery stalk in there.

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:51.688
You're gonna be a while.

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:54.316
Celery stalk.

01:09:54.316 --> 01:09:56.610
<i>Next time, you're gonna look
where you're walking.</i>

01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:58.820
<i>Huh? [laughs]</i>

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.906

01:10:10.832 --> 01:10:12.584
