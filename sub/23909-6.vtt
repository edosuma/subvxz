09:44.584 --> 09:46.760

- No, no. No, no.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.413
- Mine, too.
- It's called secret shoppers.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.633
Got to stay secret.
- And, you guys,

09:50.677 --> 09:53.331
this isn't about your husband
or your kids.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.333
I mean...

09:55.377 --> 09:56.683
I get it.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.380
You feel like you've got
to put everyone

09:58.423 --> 10:01.513

But you don't.

for yourself.

10:08.782 --> 10:12.960
This is about being
a strong, independent woman.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.265
- I'm--I'm not a woman.

10:14.309 --> 10:15.745
- I think you guys are
getting a little

10:15.789 --> 10:17.791
caught up in the details.
- Yeah.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.967
- I don't have all the answers,

10:20.010 --> 10:23.100
but I will tell you this.

10:23.144 --> 10:26.234
Ever since I started this,

10:26.277 --> 10:29.846
my perspective has changed
entirely.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.022
- Ain't that the truth.
- You guys,

10:32.066 --> 10:33.763
we're in this together.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.983
I mean, when women support
other women,

10:36.026 --> 10:37.941

gets a new Corvette.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.601
- What?
both: A Corvette?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.516
- Why didn't you say that?

right?

11:05.839 --> 11:07.667
- Jimmy.
- You in the market?

11:07.710 --> 11:10.278
'Cause we got some sweet deals.
What are you driving now?

11:10.321 --> 11:12.019
- An unmarked
government-issued sedan.

11:12.062 --> 11:14.978
- [laughing]
Well, that's--that's no fun.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.153
Go ahead and take a ride.

11:16.197 --> 11:17.415
- The bureau
doesn't like flashy.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.417
- I'm pretty sure
that J. Edgar Hoover

11:19.461 --> 11:21.724
used to rock
a feather boa.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.727
All right, well,

11:24.771 --> 11:26.163
so what can I help you with?

11:26.207 --> 11:28.078
- Well I'm hoping
we can help each other.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.515
Cops found that SUV
you reported stolen.

11:30.559 --> 11:31.691
- They did?
Where?

11:31.734 --> 11:33.475
- Bottom of Cedar Lake.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.520
- Hm.
Was there an accident?

11:35.564 --> 11:37.044
- No.
- [chuckles]

11:37.087 --> 11:38.567
Who steals a car to sink it?

11:38.610 --> 11:39.829
- I have no idea.

11:39.873 --> 11:42.310
You know who might though?
- Who?

11:42.353 --> 11:43.964
- Your wife.

11:45.617 --> 11:48.969
Maybe we should step
into your office, Mr. Boland.

11:53.016 --> 11:53.190

11:58.892 --> 12:01.503

Halloween candy, mister.

12:01.546 --> 12:04.767
- My science teacher says that
chocolate's good for the heart.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.638
- Ready, Mama!
- What's with you and pants?

12:06.682 --> 12:08.205
Are you just morally
opposed to pants?

12:08.249 --> 12:10.120
Are you on a pants strike?
- No pants!

12:10.164 --> 12:12.253
- Where are my shin guards?
- Probably in dad's car.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.645
- Dad?

12:13.689 --> 12:15.125
- Dean?
- [snaps fingers]

12:15.169 --> 12:16.518

- Shin guards.

12:18.215 --> 12:19.695
I'll look.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.872
- What's on tap for you today?

12:22.916 --> 12:25.222
- Carpool, cleaners,
grocery store.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.789
The usual.

12:27.442 --> 12:28.704
- Is that it?

12:29.574 --> 12:32.316

12:32.360 --> 12:33.753
- Yeah.

12:37.191 --> 12:40.411

let's go, let's go!

12:40.455 --> 12:41.717

12:41.761 --> 12:43.806
Hey, hey, hey!
Knock it off.

12:45.025 --> 12:47.549
- Thank you.
Have a fine and frugal day.

12:47.592 --> 12:48.811
Ma'am, I'm ready if you are.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.945
- Oh, they never carry
the mints I like.

12:52.641 --> 12:53.903
Do I know you?

12:53.947 --> 12:56.558
- Uh, no, no, I'm not--
- Nana.

12:56.601 --> 12:57.951
What are you doing here?

12:57.994 --> 13:00.388
I would have brought
the ham salad to you.

13:02.390 --> 13:06.002
- It is you.
- Oh, my God, it is.

13:06.046 --> 13:09.789
- I didn't know you worked
with my Leslie.

13:09.832 --> 13:12.356
She works
for Social Services too.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.619
- Well, it's really more
of a volunteer

13:14.663 --> 13:16.012
kind of a thing,
you know, but--

13:16.056 --> 13:17.579
- She and all her friends

13:17.622 --> 13:19.799
cleaned my whole apartment.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.803
- Yeah.
I bet they did.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.110
- She's a very sweet girl,
Leslie.

13:27.154 --> 13:30.026
- Oh, yeah.
Big heart, this one.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.767
- No, it's funny
you didn't mention

13:31.811 --> 13:34.422
Fine and Frugal
when you came over.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.946
- Oh, uh--
- That is funny, Annie.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.818
Now, why do you think that is?

13:38.861 --> 13:41.081
- Hm.
Uh, I don't know, Leslie.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.431
Maybe it's just because
your nana and I

13:43.474 --> 13:45.781
had so much to talk about.
- Oh [chuckles]

13:45.825 --> 13:49.263
- For example, how is
your fiancée, Jessica Alba?

13:49.306 --> 13:52.135
- Oh, I showed her
that beautiful picture.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.443
- Fine, yeah.
No, things are fine.

13:55.486 --> 13:58.185
- Yeah? Now, she's in
LA though, right? Ugh.

13:58.228 --> 14:01.841

you know, the distance.

14:03.581 --> 14:05.409

you left so abruptly

14:08.369 --> 14:11.676
that night, I was hoping
you'd come back again.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.809
- Oh, I wanted to Marion.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.812
Really, I just--I've been
so busy lately, you know?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.684
- Yeah, Annie has a whole life
outside of this store, Nana.

14:19.728 --> 14:22.426
You would be real shocked.

14:23.688 --> 14:27.867
- It was just nice to have
someone to talk to.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.913
- I mean, you can
talk to me, Nana.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.046
- Oh, that's different, Leslie.

14:33.089 --> 14:36.832
A woman needs the companionship
of other women.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.574
- What about your friends,
Marion?

14:39.617 --> 14:41.271
- They're dead.

14:41.793 --> 14:44.796
- Yo, Annie.
- Uh, yeah?

14:44.840 --> 14:46.798
- You got a sec?

14:46.842 --> 14:48.409
- Yeah, what up?

14:49.366 --> 14:51.673
- I bought all the merchandise
and filled out all the surveys.

14:51.716 --> 14:54.110
Just like you guys said.
- Okay?

14:54.154 --> 14:56.025
- It was super chill
and they didn't even know

14:56.069 --> 14:57.809
I was a secret shopper,
just like you guys said.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.420
- Okay, great.

14:59.463 --> 15:01.683
- And then I went to return it
all, just like you guys said.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.990
- And? What happened?

15:04.033 --> 15:06.906
- Some of the stuff
was stolen from my car.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.213
- But your windows
aren't broken.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.911
- Oh, the locks are though.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.216
Yeah.

15:14.565 --> 15:17.133

they take, Tyler?

15:18.569 --> 15:20.571

15:20.615 --> 15:22.660
a lot.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.793
- Well, how much is a lot?

15:24.836 --> 15:26.142
- Pretty much all of it.

15:26.186 --> 15:29.624
- We gave you $20,000.

15:29.667 --> 15:30.973
- Yeah.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.627
- [laughs nervously]

15:32.670 --> 15:34.977
- You guys could just
call corporate, right?

15:35.021 --> 15:36.979
I mean, this stuff must have
happened to them before.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.025
You know, they're probably
insured for it.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.287
You know, man, I generally
think the best of people.

- Oh, yeah.

All gone.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.990
So, this...

15:48.034 --> 15:49.209

- Uh, I'm sorry.

15:50.775 --> 15:51.994

- And this is...

15:52.038 --> 15:53.865

- For you.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.911
Now, we're gonna
need a sharpie.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.740

- Because we can't have anymore

15:58.783 --> 16:00.785
of these pesky orange
tippies poking through.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.744
- We are not robbing
another store.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.006
- Or anymore little old ladies.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.312
- Well, I actually agree
with that.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.053
Marion came
into the store earlier

16:07.096 --> 16:08.750
and it was like
"Driving Miss Daisy"

16:08.793 --> 16:10.491
only sadder.
- Okay, then.

16:10.534 --> 16:13.146
- So I figured we could rip off
a check cashing place

16:13.189 --> 16:15.409

- We're not robbing anything!

16:16.366 --> 16:19.500

your body in an oil drum?

16:25.419 --> 16:27.725
They soak you in lye,
and they make you into soup.

if you used to be a human

16:29.771 --> 16:31.294
or a large dog.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.297
- That's really not necessary.

16:34.341 --> 16:38.127

oil drums are real small.

- I do.
- Love to hear it.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.747
- We pay the gang back in full.

16:49.791 --> 16:52.141
- And how do we replace
the 20 grand?

16:52.185 --> 16:54.404
- We stiff our secret shoppers
instead.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.145
- We can't do that.
- At least we don't

16:56.189 --> 16:58.234
end up in an oil drum.
- No, just prison

16:58.278 --> 16:59.975

17:00.019 --> 17:01.585
- Yeah, and it wouldn't
be enough.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.457
We would have to dip
into our profits to cover it,

17:03.500 --> 17:05.459
and that would basically leave
us back where we started.

to get the money back?

17:23.085 --> 17:25.305
