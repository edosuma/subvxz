00:05.605 --> 00:07.706
Ancient greece--

00:07.708 --> 00:08.841
What that?
What that that?

00:08.843 --> 00:11.377
What thi-this?
This is a present.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.946
- Is it for me?
- What's your game, matthews?

00:13.948 --> 00:15.614
Game?
I mean no game.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.783
I just want to know who here
wants this present.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.889
Oh, maya, what?
You assume by playing
hard to get,

00:23.891 --> 00:25.624
- I'm gonna give it to you?
- Well, yes.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.793
That's one of the many arrows
in my quiver.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.528
( shudders )

00:29.530 --> 00:31.897
Medieval talk--
what are you doing to me, woman?

00:33.933 --> 00:35.968
- Riley.
- Yay!

00:38.505 --> 00:40.439
"the trojan horse"?

00:40.441 --> 00:42.875
- Surprise.
- This isn't a present.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.778
This is one of your life lessons
wrapped up in a class lesson

00:45.780 --> 00:47.713
Wrapped up in a box
of nothing.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.383
- How you doing, honey?
- I'ma worked up.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.851
I know.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.387
You assumed because
it was all neat and pretty

00:55.389 --> 00:57.356
That something good
was inside.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.992
Ancient troy was
protected by walls.

00:59.994 --> 01:02.394
The greeks couldn't get in,

01:02.396 --> 01:06.465
So they built
a big wooden horse
and left it behind.

01:06.467 --> 01:07.966
What do you think
the trojans did?

01:07.968 --> 01:09.668
They left it there because
they were afraid

01:09.670 --> 01:12.938
That somebody was trying
to teach them something.

01:14.474 --> 01:17.810
They captured it as a trophy
and brought it inside.

01:17.812 --> 01:21.313
That night, the greek soldiers
crawled out of the horse

01:21.315 --> 01:23.916
And defeated troy.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.818
What have we learned here?

01:25.820 --> 01:27.920
- Mr. Friar?
- Don't make assumptions

01:27.922 --> 01:29.455
Based on what you see?

01:29.457 --> 01:31.924
Riley, listen, I'm sorry
I made an example of you.

01:31.926 --> 01:34.526
- So here's a gift for you.
- Ooh-- no!

01:34.528 --> 01:37.429
I want to-- no!
Pretty ribbon-- no!

01:38.832 --> 01:41.467
- I'll take my chances
with that, sir.
- No, lucas.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.470
You have to assume
it was no good because
the first one was no good.

01:44.472 --> 01:47.005
- Aren't you all
proud of me, dad?
- No!

01:48.641 --> 01:51.643
- "get out of detention free."
- ooh, I could use one of those.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.912
Gimme that
and I won't call you
"ranger rick" all week.

01:53.914 --> 01:56.415
- Here you go.
- Thanks, ranger roy.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.350
Lemme guess.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.686
Ranger roy is filling in
for ranger rick?

02:00.688 --> 02:03.322
All week.
And now... You.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.857
Oh, is something
gonna happen to me?

02:04.859 --> 02:07.526
Yes, it is.

'get out of detention free'

02:20.040 --> 02:22.608
To maya then watch her

02:26.880 --> 02:29.348
Never assume.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.617
Look more deeply.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.986
Just because something is
wrapped up all pretty,

02:33.988 --> 02:36.655
Doesn't always mean it is.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.524

When you're all
working for me.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.860
Thank you.  I am farkle!

03:48.862 --> 03:51.964
- I don't understand debate.
- I say you do.

03:51.966 --> 03:53.865
Okay.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.468
I like debate-- exploring
two sides of the same thing--

03:56.470 --> 03:58.403
Good and bad,
light and dark,

03:58.405 --> 03:59.671
Right in front of you
at the same time.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.006
Where else are you
gonna get that?

04:02.609 --> 04:04.076
Oh, right here.
Look at you.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.580
And now
from einstein academy,

04:08.582 --> 04:10.782
"undefeated this season,

04:10.784 --> 04:13.785
72 pounds of raw
intellectual power!

04:13.787 --> 04:17.756
She is who your mama
wishes she gave birth to!"

04:18.891 --> 04:21.460
The one, the only...

04:21.462 --> 04:23.028
Smackle!

04:23.030 --> 04:25.797
<i>( rock music playing )</i>

04:35.041 --> 04:36.975
<i>( music stops )</i>

04:36.977 --> 04:38.910
You goin' down, chump.

04:42.882 --> 04:46.518
Wearing a uniform makes you
surrender to conformity

04:46.520 --> 04:49.855
And sacrifices uniqueness,
which is our most
valuable freedom.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.491
Don't let anybody tell you
what to wear.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.626
Don't let anybody
tell you what to be.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.596
Smackle,
the one and only, out.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.702
Well, before I announce
the winner,

05:03.704 --> 05:06.638
Let me remind you all that
our final debate of the season

05:06.640 --> 05:08.840
Will be held right here
next week,

05:08.842 --> 05:10.876
Where our thought-provoking
topic will be

05:10.878 --> 05:13.478
"is beauty only skin deep?"

05:16.883 --> 05:18.984
Great, thank you.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.019
So the winner

05:21.021 --> 05:22.888
Of today's debate is...

05:24.023 --> 05:25.957
Isadora smackle,

05:25.959 --> 05:28.126
<i>Einstein academy.</i>

05:29.996 --> 05:32.664
It looks like our debate team
could use some help.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.000
Yeah, smackle's
definitely got game.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.669
She beats farkle
every time.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.638
You think he's gotten
used to it by now?

05:44.143 --> 05:46.611
( groaning )
it hurts.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.647
Nope.  Good thing
we're there for him.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.183
Being there for him is
the most important thing
we can be--

05:53.286 --> 05:55.620
- Melon balls.
- Ooh.

05:59.592 --> 06:01.960
Valiant effort as usual,
my arch-nemesis.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.930
Perhaps a smoothie
would take the sting out
of my latest victory.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.932
Yeah.
Perhaps you're right.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.900
I'll go see.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.737
Smackle, you fool.
You forgot how literal he is.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.772
Farkle, I meant

06:13.774 --> 06:15.741
Would you like to get
a smoothie with me?

06:15.743 --> 06:19.311
Isadora, what part
of "arch-nemesis"
do you not understand?

06:19.313 --> 06:21.913
Farkle, you might find
this hard to believe,

06:21.915 --> 06:23.882
But I am a significant
amount of fun.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.984
Would you like to see
my fun face?

06:25.986 --> 06:27.285
That would be
of interest to me.

06:28.621 --> 06:30.188
- Proceed.
- I'm doing it!

06:32.792 --> 06:35.994
Well, farkle, good job
being smart and everything.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.897
Thanks for coming, riley.
Sorry you had to see me
lose again.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.633
Wonderful debate, farkle.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.569
A memory that will
live with me right up until
the next thing happens.

06:48.307 --> 06:51.910
Well, smackle, good job
being smart and everything.

06:53.279 --> 06:55.013
( robotically )
I am sad.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.116
What?

06:59.619 --> 07:01.820
Farkle and I are
perfect for each other.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.922
- Why does he prefer you?
- I don't know.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.924
If I knew, I'd stop.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.160
Well, there's nothing
left to do now

07:08.162 --> 07:11.696
But get a smoothie
all alone and continue
this good cry I'm having.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.865
- You're crying?
- Yes.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.067
A-wah a-wah.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.036
I don't think
that's actually--

07:18.038 --> 07:19.871
( louder )
a-wah a-wah...

07:19.873 --> 07:21.973
( mumbles gibberish )

07:23.776 --> 07:27.379
Look, I am going
to ask you something

07:27.381 --> 07:30.282
Really fast and then
I'm going to regret it.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.217
You wanna come
to my house?

07:32.219 --> 07:34.286
Ooh.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.889
Yes, I would like
to come to your house.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.925
There is much I can
learn from you.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.637
Oh, no!  I already have
a weird friend.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.940
She means me.

08:05.284 --> 08:08.253
- Auggie?
- Why-y-y?!

08:09.388 --> 08:12.090
Does this have something
to do with-- ucch-- ava?

08:12.092 --> 08:14.292
Ava!

08:14.294 --> 08:16.428
Even when I think of her
backwards

08:16.430 --> 08:18.964
She's still ava!

08:23.936 --> 08:26.071
Okay, tell me
what happened right now.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.340
She's through with me.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.809
Oh!  Yay!

08:30.811 --> 08:34.980
Even when I think of it
backwards it's still yay!

08:36.782 --> 08:39.384
Okay, tell me what--
ucch-- ava did.

08:39.386 --> 08:42.420
( hyperventilating )
she said we might not

08:42.422 --> 08:44.823
Be together
for the rest

08:44.825 --> 08:46.992
Of our lives!

08:46.994 --> 08:49.094
Okay, deep breath, honey.

08:49.096 --> 08:52.297
She thinks there could be...

08:52.299 --> 08:54.065
Others.

08:54.067 --> 08:57.002
Honey, of course.
That's only natural.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.904
No, it's not.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.972
You're supposed
to meet somebody
and fall in love

09:00.974 --> 09:02.841
And be together forever.

09:02.843 --> 09:06.144
Oh, honey, who put
that crazy idea in your head?

09:06.146 --> 09:08.947
You and daddy.

09:09.883 --> 09:15.353
I wonder how many people
the idea of cory and topanga
has ruined.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.756
Me!

09:21.460 --> 09:23.228
Why do I have to be
a part of your campaign

09:23.230 --> 09:25.497
To befriend every little
woodland creature?

09:25.499 --> 09:27.866
Which woodland creature
am I in your mind?

09:27.868 --> 09:29.267
You're like
a little gopher...

09:29.269 --> 09:31.836
Chipmunk combo deal.

09:33.205 --> 09:35.206
Maya, smackle
needs our help.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.343
Yes.
I need you to teach me
the equation for beauty.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.879
- Why?
- Smackle loves farkle.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.213
Why?

09:42.215 --> 09:43.982
But he prefers
you both to me

09:43.984 --> 09:46.851
Because you're both
aesthetically pleasing.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.921
I, on the other hand,
am less aesthetically
pleasing,

09:49.923 --> 09:52.824
But am superior
in every other area.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.060
Okay, so you want us
to make you beautiful?

09:55.062 --> 09:57.495
Yes, but I don't expect
you to be able to change

09:57.497 --> 10:00.031
A trillion years of evolution
in five seconds.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.968
Let me know when
it's four seconds.

10:03.903 --> 10:05.070
Go.

10:09.976 --> 10:12.344
I'm... Pretty?

10:12.346 --> 10:15.046
You're the hottest
little gopher-chipmunk
in the whole forest.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.253
Who's the genius now?

10:24.390 --> 10:26.091
( unison )
stop it.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.869
My outward appearance
now seems to represent

10:37.871 --> 10:40.939
The current trends agreeable
to the general populace.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.475
Then why are you still
talking like you don't know
what you look like?

10:45.511 --> 10:48.046
Ah, my speech.
That's an easy fix.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.081
- I don't think so.
- Awesome,

10:50.083 --> 10:52.183
Like, giggle,
question, omigosh.

10:53.552 --> 10:56.021
Do you wanna lay that out
again for us normals?

10:56.023 --> 10:58.990
Observations reveal
that if I merely insert
"awesome,"

10:58.992 --> 11:01.559
"like," "omigosh,"
and giggle at everything
like it's a question,

11:01.561 --> 11:04.095
I will assimilate
into the general
teenage population.

11:05.464 --> 11:07.232
( snickers )
it's not that easy, smackle.

11:07.234 --> 11:10.035
- E=mc2.
- What did you do that for?

11:10.037 --> 11:12.537
Like "e" totally
equals m.C.Squared!

11:12.539 --> 11:14.606
( giggles )
omigosh, awesome!

11:17.076 --> 11:20.078
- E=mc2.
- I understand the universe.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.981
( mimic explosion )

11:28.120 --> 11:29.587
Is this debate team?

11:29.589 --> 11:32.524
No, it's the after-school
male models' club.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.093
- Ha!
- Ha!

11:36.228 --> 11:38.463
I want to join.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.598
( weakly )
ha!

11:41.967 --> 11:44.002
Shouldn't you be out
hitting a home run
or something?

11:44.004 --> 11:45.470
We don't debate
sports or cars.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.338
Gentlemen, you're making
assumptions,

11:47.340 --> 11:49.507
And my current assignment
is to consider
how assumptions

11:49.509 --> 11:51.042
Lead to our ultimate downfall.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.343
So let's not judge a book
by its cover.

11:53.412 --> 11:55.313
Looks like a book
about baseball.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.284
Lucas is my friend.
Welcome to the team.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.054
- Ladies.
- Farkle.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.589
Maya, why are you
wearing glasses?

12:04.591 --> 12:07.025
They're smackle's.
I'm just holding them
for her...

12:07.027 --> 12:09.094
On my face.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.996
We want to see if people
will treat maya differently

12:11.998 --> 12:15.900
- Now that she looks smart.
- Hello, suddenly-approachable-
woman.

12:16.903 --> 12:22.207
Mine's 20/800.
I can basically
only hear you.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.676
I don't have
a prescription.
Although I must say,

12:24.678 --> 12:27.479
You guys are looking
a lot less blurry.

12:27.481 --> 12:31.116
That's the nicest thing
any girl's ever said to us.

12:32.151 --> 12:34.219
I liked you better
blurry.

12:34.221 --> 12:37.489
That's the second nicest thing
a girl's ever said to us.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.958
I think you look nice
any way you are, maya.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.559
Thanks.  You wanna
go out with us?

12:46.065 --> 12:48.032
Out like "out on a date"?

12:48.034 --> 12:50.568
Aw, no.
Out like out there
with me and riley

12:50.570 --> 12:52.704
Because there's someone else
we want to introduce you to.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.939
Yep.  We think
you'll really like her.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.975
I have a very specific
taste in girls.
Is she one?

12:56.977 --> 12:59.110
- Uh-huh.
- That'll do it!

13:03.482 --> 13:07.986
Presenting your date
from the modeling runways
of paris, France--

13:07.988 --> 13:10.522
The new face of geek chic--

13:10.524 --> 13:14.592
( french accent )
isadora  <i>smackle.</i>

13:14.594 --> 13:16.194
Wow.

13:21.668 --> 13:26.404
You know, just us girls
playing with our hair
and clothes.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.439
Are you finally intrigued
by me, farkle?

13:28.441 --> 13:30.441
I'm intrigued that
my friends don't realize

13:30.443 --> 13:32.610
- That you are an evil genius.
- ( chuckles )

13:32.612 --> 13:34.979
But a pretty evil genius,
don't you think?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.549
This is debate
preparation,
isn't it?

13:37.551 --> 13:40.985
- What?
- The next debate is
"is beauty only skin deep?"

13:40.987 --> 13:42.987
Smackle doesn't want
to be like you guys.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.757
Smackle only wants to win.
You ladies have been played.

13:45.759 --> 13:49.627
- Is this true, smackle?
- Affirmative.

13:49.629 --> 13:53.064
Riley, do I please
have your permission
to mess her up now?

13:54.099 --> 13:55.700
Negative.

13:55.702 --> 13:58.469
Smackle, did you assume
this outward change
in your appearance

13:58.471 --> 14:00.772
- Would not affect
your inner self?
- Of course it won't.

14:00.774 --> 14:03.174
I am smackle.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.311
But look, four red nails
and one blue one.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.413
I don't know why.

14:08.415 --> 14:11.649
That said, how could
any outward change

14:11.651 --> 14:13.685
Possibly affect
the inner smackle?

14:14.620 --> 14:15.687
Hi, guys.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.756
Wow, smackle,
you look great.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.158
( giggles )

14:21.727 --> 14:24.095
Did that just
come from me?

14:24.097 --> 14:26.030
Smile at her.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.532
Omigosh.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.767
Omigosh,
I just said "omigosh."

14:29.769 --> 14:32.437
Like, awesome.
Question?

14:32.439 --> 14:34.205
Are you okay, smackle?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.708
I don't understand
what's happening to me.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.043
Why don't you
sit next to her, lucas?

14:42.314 --> 14:45.783
No one that's ever
looked like you has
ever sat this close.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.720
Are you sitting here
because you want
to be my mate?

14:50.756 --> 14:53.458
I'm sitting here
because the seat was empty.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.494
- You smell like pine trees.
- Thank you.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.097
- Our feet are touching.
- You're doing that.

15:00.499 --> 15:03.201
Hmm.
Smackle, would you
mind telling me,

15:03.203 --> 15:05.069
What is the square root
of 36?

15:05.071 --> 15:08.139
- Who cares?
- Excellent.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.842
Lucas is on our debate team.
Will that be a distraction
to you?

15:10.844 --> 15:13.278
Should be, yeah.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.779
Good.  Let's go.

15:14.781 --> 15:17.115
We've got a debate
to prepare for.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.488
What have you
done to me?

15:23.490 --> 15:25.423
I'm broken.
I'm pretty.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.258
I'm confused.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.093
We can put you back.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.095
Oh, I'm not goin' back!

15:31.097 --> 15:33.298
I'm not  <i>that </i> confused.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.672
- Hi, auggie.
- Hi, farkle.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.840
Riley's not home.

15:42.842 --> 15:45.710
So what are you doing
sitting in the bay window?

15:45.712 --> 15:49.514
I just wanted to see
if sitting in the window
would fix my woman trouble.

15:50.716 --> 15:52.884
Riley always sits
in the window.

15:52.886 --> 15:55.353
But I think it
only works for her.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.790
- What happened?
- Ava said we might not be
together forever.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.792
And you expected
that you would be?

16:00.794 --> 16:03.361
Yes, because I'm only
this many

16:03.363 --> 16:05.129
And I still
have high hopes.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.634
If you like her,
she must be really something.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.136
Oh yeah,
she's really something.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.505
You know, farkle,
we have a front door.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.874
I know, but I'm here
on business.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.478
Okay, who's first?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.313
I am.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.614
Farkle, do you have
an appointment?

16:23.616 --> 16:25.850
No, I'm a walk-in.

16:25.852 --> 16:28.820
I'm sorry, farkle.
Feel free to read

16:28.822 --> 16:30.455
One of our waiting room
magazines.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.522
We're jammed.

16:38.197 --> 16:39.430
Go.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.799
I want to be with ava
until I die.

16:41.801 --> 16:45.169
- She doesn't feel the same way?
- She's vague, man.

16:46.572 --> 16:49.207
She's messin'
with my mind.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.943
But it doesn't matter
what she says,

16:51.945 --> 16:53.711
It matters is what she does.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.714
- Did she actually
break up with you?
- No.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.716
What?!
Wait a minute.

16:58.718 --> 17:02.653
Auggie, I assumed
you guys broke up.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.857
Oh, mom.
You should never assume.
Didn't dad teach you that?

17:05.859 --> 17:08.326
Yeah, don't you
get the home versions
of these lessons?

17:08.328 --> 17:10.862
- You're married to the guy.
- Of course I do.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.364
There's just
so many of them.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.601
Oh no, I married feeny.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.973
So how is ava messin'
with you?

17:21.975 --> 17:24.709
She says we might not
be together forever.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.844
But she also says we might.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.213
So you still have
a girlfriend.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.949
And I let you eat cake
and whipped cream.

17:33.819 --> 17:36.654
Hmm, so I had
a pretty good day!

17:40.592 --> 17:41.793
Next!

17:43.796 --> 17:46.230
- Yes?
- I'm tortured.

17:46.232 --> 17:49.267
- What about?
- Smackle's not gonna be
at her best at the debate.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.803
- Why not?
- Because you made her better.

17:51.805 --> 17:56.240
- Except you didn't.
- You want us to change
her back?

17:56.242 --> 17:59.744
If we do, farkle,
you'll lose the debate.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.979
I only want to beat her
when she's really her.

18:01.981 --> 18:04.582
She's the best arch-nemesis
I could ever have.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.884
Otherwise, if you beat her,

18:06.886 --> 18:08.519
It doesn't count.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.488
You're pretty smart, maya.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.257
Even without glasses?

18:19.631 --> 18:21.799
- You promised
you'd change her back.
- We tried.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.901
- She wouldn't go for it.
- ( sighs )

18:26.505 --> 18:28.272
I didn't want to win
this way, smackle.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.575
I hope you enjoy
being beautiful.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.844
Oh, I do.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.714
How the once-mighty
have fallen.

18:38.584 --> 18:41.986
The nation of troy was charmed
by a beautiful wooden horse.

18:41.988 --> 18:44.655
<i>They neglected</i>
<i>to consider what was inside.</i>

18:44.657 --> 18:48.726
And they lost everything
because of outer beauty.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.729
Don't be fooled
by a pretty wrapper.

18:51.731 --> 18:55.366
I mean, who keeps
the wrapping paper?

18:56.301 --> 18:57.935
I wear ribbons.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.871
Okay.

18:59.873 --> 19:02.673
And our concluding statement
will be made by lucas friar.

19:06.778 --> 19:08.846
There can be absolutely
no debate

19:08.848 --> 19:10.915
That the quest for outer beauty
at the expense

19:10.917 --> 19:13.818
Of one's inner self is
a road to personal destruction.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.387
People make assumptions.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.923
I've been labeled a jock
and a cowboy,

19:18.925 --> 19:20.892
And this is from my friends.

19:20.894 --> 19:22.560
<i>But here's a little secret.</i>

19:22.562 --> 19:25.997
I like school
and I do pretty well.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.933
You might look at me
and assume baseball player.

19:28.935 --> 19:32.370
I look at me and I know
I'd better get good grades,

19:32.372 --> 19:35.006
Because what's on the inside
has to be more important

19:35.008 --> 19:37.975
Than what's on the outside
to get into a good college

19:37.977 --> 19:40.978
And into a good life.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.382
Because beauty
is not skin deep.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.651
Thank you.

19:48.987 --> 19:52.657
Omigosh, I'm like so totally
unprepared and scared.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.592
We finally got her.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.595
Maybe that's what
you would assume I would say,

19:57.597 --> 19:59.897
Considering the effort
I put into my appearance.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.499
Uh-oh.

20:03.001 --> 20:04.669
I'm here to argue today

20:04.671 --> 20:06.904
That beauty
actually is skin deep.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.073
<i>So I've done some research</i>

20:09.075 --> 20:11.375
And I've learned...

20:11.377 --> 20:13.411
That it is.

20:13.413 --> 20:16.881
When you get compliments
from people who don't ordinarily
compliment you,

20:16.883 --> 20:19.517
When people look
at you differently,

20:19.519 --> 20:21.085
Packaging does matter.

20:23.155 --> 20:25.056
I wasn't pretty,

20:25.058 --> 20:26.924
Then I was.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.760
This is a world
where "pretty"

20:29.762 --> 20:32.463
Seems better somehow.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.932
Which is too bad,

20:34.934 --> 20:36.400
But it's not debatable.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.538
However, I also learned

20:40.540 --> 20:44.008
That if you get swept up
by what you are
on the outside

20:44.010 --> 20:47.144
You can lose who you are
on the inside.

20:47.146 --> 20:51.415
Even though it is easy
to be fooled by the beauty
of a trojan horse,

20:51.417 --> 20:55.419
Its real power comes
from the army within--

20:55.421 --> 20:58.022
Intelligence,
compassion,

20:58.024 --> 21:00.958
Integrity, courage.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.862
That army is the real you,

21:04.864 --> 21:07.098
No matter what
you look like.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.902
So even though beauty
may be skin deep,

21:11.904 --> 21:14.905
Beauty is nowhere near
as important

21:14.907 --> 21:17.508
As the army inside.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.644
And I'll try
not to forget that.

21:25.217 --> 21:28.085
Well, look at all of you.

21:28.087 --> 21:31.922
You're all very deeply
beautiful.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.493
Especially you, farkle.

21:37.095 --> 21:39.063
Thank you.

21:43.001 --> 21:45.870
- She beat us.
- Yeah.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.471
Thank you
for taking me in.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.140
I hope we can be friends.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.175
Cool.

21:51.177 --> 21:53.778
We've got a lot
to learn from each other.

22:11.697 --> 22:14.131
I continue to not
understand anything.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.267
That's what's so beautiful
about you.

22:21.873 --> 22:23.741
Valiant effort, lucas,

22:23.743 --> 22:26.944
Perhaps a smoothie would
take the sting out of
my latest victory.

22:28.046 --> 22:30.614
Whoa whoa,
back off, sister.

22:31.717 --> 22:32.950
I actually think
that smackle is

22:32.952 --> 22:35.186
Just enjoying some
newfound confidence, riley.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.954
You know me too well,
arch-nemesis.

22:38.023 --> 22:41.726
She was using you
to make farkle jealous!

22:41.728 --> 22:44.595
( chuckles )
well, that's a new one.

22:47.299 --> 22:49.066
Tell me the truth, farkle.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.302
If riley and maya
weren't beautiful,

22:51.304 --> 22:53.137
Would you still love them?

22:53.139 --> 22:55.873
They're beautiful?

22:55.875 --> 22:57.842
Oh yeah,

22:57.844 --> 22:59.210
I never really noticed.
