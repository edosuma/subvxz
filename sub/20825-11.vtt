WEBVTT

00:06.173 --> 00:09.301
Garrett Walker's testimony
couldn't be more damning.

00:09.384 --> 00:12.596
Francis Underwood is front and center
in a scheme that had

00:12.680 --> 00:15.766
Chinese money influencing
an American election.

00:15.849 --> 00:19.019
Testimony from a disgraced
and disgruntled former president.

00:19.603 --> 00:20.979
Why is he just speaking up now?

00:21.063 --> 00:23.106
Well, are you suggesting
that they shouldn't...

00:23.190 --> 00:25.568
take what Walker said seriously?
I mean...

00:25.651 --> 00:27.069
If it's true, why stay silent so long?

00:27.152 --> 00:29.572
Which is a question
I'm sure the Judiciary Committee

00:29.655 --> 00:31.657
-will ask once it's up and going.
-[Seth grunts]

00:31.740 --> 00:34.702
My sources say articles of impeachment
could be voted on

00:34.785 --> 00:35.869
as early as the end of the week.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.495
Now as if the House is that efficient.

00:37.580 --> 00:40.916
Look, President Walker is the one
who should be scrutinized here.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.876
He's talking out of
both sides of his mouth.

00:42.960 --> 00:47.631
And let's not forget, he has had some
emotional problems in the past.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.383
Underwood has disrespected the presidency
since before he was thought of

00:50.467 --> 00:52.636
-for Secretary of State...
-You seem blinded by this crusade.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.721
...when he was House Whip.

00:53.804 --> 00:57.641
[stammering] You guys, wait.
If Underwood is impeached, then--

00:57.725 --> 00:59.101
That's a hypothetical. It's dangerous.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.477
[Rachel Maddow] Fair. Well...

01:00.561 --> 01:03.396
Tom, where would impeachment leave
Vice President Claire Underwood?

01:03.480 --> 01:05.608
In the Oval, as president.

01:05.691 --> 01:09.361
What their arrangement would be,
in that case, is anybody's guess.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.406
Seth, what is this like right now
for the first couple?

01:13.490 --> 01:15.743
They're avoiding all of this distraction.

01:15.826 --> 01:18.704
They're continuing to do the work
of the American people.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.557
-[Claire] Censure.
-No.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.683
I see Mark's point.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.644
There is no way to stop the Republicans
in the House.

03:06.729 --> 03:08.021
Walker's not a reliable witness.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.982
Is what he said verifiable?

03:10.565 --> 03:12.192
So, impeachment is inevitable.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.694
[scoffs] Well, that's...
that's a presumption.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.571
[Claire] The Democratic Senate

03:16.654 --> 03:19.449
will not be inclined to remove
a Democratic president.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.868
But they need political cover.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.660
Censure will help them with that.

03:22.745 --> 03:26.456
[sighs] I mean,
they might propose other penalties,

03:26.539 --> 03:28.917
a fine, a statement of condemnation

03:29.001 --> 03:31.754
but they'll stop short
of finding criminal wrongdoing.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.548
And if it happens quickly,
everyone can move on.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.967
Did you two get together
on this privately?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.093
No.

03:39.344 --> 03:43.348
Francis, this is one way
to salvage your first term.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.892
Walker was supposed to plead the Fifth.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.559
Well, things took an unexpected turn.

03:46.643 --> 03:50.480
Yes. He went back on his deal,
because he's as pliable as his testimony.

03:50.563 --> 03:54.651
Mark, I will not be impeached in the House
and it will never get to the Senate.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.529
We will destroy
Garrett Walker's credibility

03:57.612 --> 04:00.698
and the case will fall apart.

04:00.783 --> 04:01.909
Okay.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.036
[door opens]

04:09.958 --> 04:11.209
[door closes]

04:12.878 --> 04:14.963
[Catherine] Can I get immunity?

04:15.047 --> 04:16.548
[Maureen] Depends on what you give them.

04:16.630 --> 04:19.466
I'll reach out to a ranking member,
but you're not gonna get anonymity...

04:19.551 --> 04:21.845
-Cathy.
-[cell phone vibrating]

04:21.928 --> 04:23.555
-Jane.
-Hello?

04:24.681 --> 04:27.267
You've been on my mind.
Can you believe what's going on?

04:27.350 --> 04:29.186
Excuse me for a moment.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.856
As my mother used to say,
"It's a red hot mess."

04:32.940 --> 04:35.692
Frank Underwood's demise
doesn't have to be yours.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.154
There are non-profits, NGOs
that would be dying to work with you.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.656
Well, as far as I know,
I still have a job. [chuckles]

04:41.739 --> 04:43.200
No, of course.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.452
But who knows who they'll come after next?

04:45.535 --> 04:47.788
I was never part of their inner circle.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.582
You were smart to go with Maureen.
She's a good lawyer.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.960
If someone can find you an exit, it's her.

04:53.043 --> 04:57.505
Well, I'm not gonna go away easily,
so thank you for your concern, Jane.

04:57.589 --> 04:58.673
It is concern.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.425
Uh... [inhales deeply]

05:00.508 --> 05:05.055
do you think the vice president had
any knowledge of this stuff?

05:06.014 --> 05:08.809
Well, as I said, I have no idea.

05:11.186 --> 05:15.107
If... if Claire survives this
and becomes president,

05:15.190 --> 05:17.150
where does that leave you?

05:18.735 --> 05:21.696
Well, I've been at this
for 30 years, Jane,

05:21.779 --> 05:23.240
so I think I can survive.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.118
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to alarm you.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.829
I'm not alarmed.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.372
All I'm trying to say,

05:30.455 --> 05:32.499
I'm on your side.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.634
If it's the difference in being
in office or being out,

05:42.717 --> 05:44.052
we can work around that.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.845
Working in handcuffs.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.348
Censure is a setback. It's not a loss.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.725
You're very confident and very insistent.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.104
-We can come out of this, Francis.
-No, you mean you can.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.188
Can you, for once,

05:55.272 --> 05:58.816
just take something at face value
instead of fighting it?

05:58.901 --> 06:02.154
As if I can be washed clean of past sins.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.364
-How long have you known me?
-Forever.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.740
How well do you know me?

06:05.823 --> 06:08.743
How, in your wildest imagination,
could you, Claire Underwood,

06:08.826 --> 06:11.413
think I would be okay with this?

06:12.956 --> 06:14.082
Think about it, please.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.794
This is the fate of my presidency!

06:17.877 --> 06:21.339
The people want to forgive you.

06:21.423 --> 06:22.632
Let them.

06:26.636 --> 06:27.804
[Angela urinating]

06:27.887 --> 06:28.931
[chuckles softly]

06:29.597 --> 06:31.641
Come out here already.
Give me the rest of it.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.187
Hammerschmidt is a straight-up workaholic.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.772
-But... he's getting close.
-[toilet flushing]

06:37.855 --> 06:39.149
Putting the pieces together.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.692
What's he still grinding so hard for?

06:40.775 --> 06:43.070
Looks like Walker's gonna bring
Underwood down.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.910
I don't wanna do this anymore.

06:52.204 --> 06:55.082
-Zoe Barnes. Rachel Posner.
-Sean, please, I...

06:55.165 --> 06:57.250
[stammers] I was the one trying
to get him back on that.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.836
-That's what got me fired.
-Can we stop talking about this?

06:59.919 --> 07:00.920
[sighs heavily]

07:01.004 --> 07:03.548
-Where's my drink?
-Don't do that. Look at me. Look.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.844
This is me... not talking.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.680
Hmm. [exhales sharply]

07:10.763 --> 07:13.350
-Come here. Come here.
-[chuckles]

07:14.935 --> 07:17.437
But if I can be of any help,
you let me know.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.771
[sighs]

07:18.855 --> 07:21.191
-Mm-hmm.
-Uh-huh. [groans]

07:21.274 --> 07:22.609
-[chuckles]
-You're gonna get it.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.527
-Give me a taste of that.
-Mmm! Mm-hmm.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.369
[Eric] Slow down.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.374
-Pull over!
-[panting]

07:40.710 --> 07:43.380
[pants] You're going pretty hard,
Mr. President. You okay?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.966
Well enough for a man whose fate
is hanging in the balance.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.050
No.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.095
-Your fate is sealed.
-Oh, how's that?

07:50.178 --> 07:51.846
You have a vision for me, Eric?

07:51.929 --> 07:55.392
Even if you're impeached and convicted...
you still make history.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.644
Augustus Underwood was
just another redneck

07:57.727 --> 08:01.648
who died fighting for the wrong side,
forgotten by everyone but you and me.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.985
But if Francis Underwood
is removed from office?

08:05.068 --> 08:08.196
Your legacy won't die.
It'll be solidified.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.698
You'll be infamous.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.618
Legacy and infamy are not the same thing.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.787
You'll be remembered.
Who cares why?

08:15.870 --> 08:17.164
I have to get back.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.831
Hey, hold up. Let me explain.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.168
Francis.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.505
-[engines rumbling]
-Hey!

08:43.648 --> 08:44.941
Francis.

08:47.569 --> 08:48.778
Francis?

09:03.460 --> 09:07.755
Just to be clear, it's not that
I haven't always known you were there.

09:07.839 --> 09:10.092
It's that I have mixed feelings about you.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.470
I question your intentions...

09:13.553 --> 09:16.639
and I'm ambivalent about attention.

09:17.432 --> 09:21.394
But don't take it personally.
It's how I feel about most everybody.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.855
[Doug] How can we trust anything he says?

09:24.731 --> 09:28.443
Garrett Walker was medicated while
he was in office. We all know that.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.863
No, it's not a talking point.
It's the truth.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.118
We don't know exactly what he was taking.

09:40.663 --> 09:41.998
Off the record...

09:43.208 --> 09:45.835
can you tell me what
Tom Hammerschmidt's working on?

09:47.795 --> 09:51.048
Come on, you two don't
cross paths over there?

09:53.050 --> 09:56.263
He reached out to me on a story.
I never heard back.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.226
Okay. Thank you.

Uh, no idea.

This isn't Watergate... yet.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.745
Well, you were right about one thing.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.830
Garrett's testimony did not
make me any friends.

12:27.914 --> 12:28.915
Not in your party, no.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.501
Well, as of this morning,
I'm officially an independent.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.170
I think the GOP can find me
a place on judiciary.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.548
-Okay, Alex.
-It's a good move.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.634
Four years from now, I think an outsider's
what the voter will be looking for.

12:39.717 --> 12:43.346
Yeah, third-party candidate is the future,
and always will be.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.224
Why did Garrett Walker change his mind?

12:47.809 --> 12:49.352
It wasn't me who made that happen.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.688
I don't know.

Sometimes things happen
without us knowing why.

but that's all.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.924
That's right, that's all.

13:20.633 --> 13:24.971
But there are agents in the FBI who were
not happy with the way this went down.

13:25.054 --> 13:28.725
And not one of them will let us
use their name on the record.

<i>the Underwood campaign</i>
<i>had a Muslim visiting the US</i>

14:50.222 --> 14:53.560
<i>wrongly arrested in order to</i>
<i>influence the vote on Election Day.</i>

14:53.643 --> 14:54.727
<i>And if you believe that,</i>

14:54.811 --> 14:57.439
<i>then you have to ask some questions</i>
<i>about the impact this had</i>

14:57.522 --> 14:58.815
<i>on the results in Tennessee,</i>

14:58.898 --> 15:01.651
<i>where President Underwood</i>
<i>was predicted to lose.</i>

15:01.734 --> 15:05.655
<i>We all know that ICO is a real threat.</i>
<i>Nobody is denying that, and I--</i>

15:05.738 --> 15:07.073
-[TV cuts off]
-[phone continues ringing]

15:07.156 --> 15:09.241
[sighs and sniffles]

15:10.452 --> 15:12.286
No calls get through to me, not today.

15:12.369 --> 15:13.830
And if you get pressed,

15:13.913 --> 15:15.540
the White House has no comment.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.791
Yes, sir.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.751
Close the door behind you, please.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.629
[sniffles]

15:22.254 --> 15:23.756
-[stammers and sighs]
-[door closes]

15:23.840 --> 15:25.257
What do you know about this?

15:25.341 --> 15:26.843
First of all, what are you getting at?

15:26.926 --> 15:30.597
And secondly, if I had any information,
I wouldn't be keeping it to myself.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.933
Seth, I am asking you straight up.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.393
If you know anything, you tell me now.

15:36.478 --> 15:39.146
-Don't make me find out.
-Or what?

15:41.441 --> 15:42.859
What are you gonna do, Doug?

15:43.485 --> 15:45.820
You gonna suffocate me
with a White House mug?

15:47.822 --> 15:49.031
The shit is hitting the fan

15:49.115 --> 15:52.452
and we're all going to be covered in it
if we don't get to work.

15:52.535 --> 15:55.872
Now... can I please get back to it?

16:02.336 --> 16:03.630
Shit. [sighs]

16:04.839 --> 16:07.884
[Green] We're essentially turning on
an apparatus that's already in place.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.177
We'll enable audio capabilities.

16:10.261 --> 16:13.515
All calls, e-mails, messages
in and out of the White House

16:13.598 --> 16:15.558
will be monitored and archived.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.269
Every phone call will be recorded
as we search for the leak.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.437
Video surveillance?

16:20.521 --> 16:24.817
-We can install additional devices, but--
-We use what's already there.

16:24.901 --> 16:27.904
It enables us to look and listen in
on every computer

16:27.987 --> 16:30.281
and every cell phone
of everyone working for us.

16:30.364 --> 16:34.076
[Green] We'll set up a satellite office
limited to Mr. Stamper and myself.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.746
Assistant Director Green and I will bring
whatever is valuable forward.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.414
[Frank] I want direct access.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.916
Live streaming.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.544
I assure you, Mr. President,
we'll bring you anything of substance.

16:44.796 --> 16:45.797
Do it.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.258
And needless to say...

16:49.341 --> 16:51.343
I report only to you, sir.

16:55.557 --> 16:56.558
[door opens]

16:57.224 --> 16:58.267
[door closes]

16:58.350 --> 17:00.603
-I wanna know who did this to me.
-I'm on it, sir.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.029
[door closes]

17:10.112 --> 17:11.363
You're having doubts about Doug?

17:11.446 --> 17:13.825
-Why? Are you?
-No, I'm just...

17:15.451 --> 17:17.744
[sighs] I'm questioning everything,
I guess.

17:19.288 --> 17:23.084
Until this is resolved, you and I should
be very careful about what we say or do.

17:23.166 --> 17:26.295
And our personal needs
have to be put aside.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.382
You know people.
You know them for years.

17:30.466 --> 17:34.679
And then... suddenly they're like
strangers in your kitchen.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.766
Familiar can turn foreign on a dime.

17:46.273 --> 17:49.360
-Is there anything I can do?
-[Doug] <i>You can be quiet.</i>

17:49.986 --> 17:52.196
Doug, I am not the leak here.
You know that.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.448
<i>-I'll be in touch.</i>
-Don't hang up.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.369
Do I need to make a list of the risks
I've taken for this administration?

17:58.452 --> 18:00.580
<i>Things I have never done before.</i>

18:00.663 --> 18:02.749
Let's just talk in person, okay?

18:05.459 --> 18:06.878
[doorbell rings]

18:14.301 --> 18:15.427
Yes?

18:15.511 --> 18:17.429
[woman on intercom] <i>LeAnn Harvey, please.</i>

18:17.513 --> 18:19.515
-Who is it?
<i>-FBI.</i>

18:32.028 --> 18:35.364
If you think of anything,
that's my cell at the bottom of the card.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.784
Was it a suicide?

18:37.867 --> 18:39.911
Barrel of the gun was pressed
against his eye, so...

18:39.994 --> 18:41.203
[inhales]

18:41.287 --> 18:43.873
You were his contact.
Would he do something like that?

18:45.541 --> 18:46.834
I don't think so.

18:46.918 --> 18:47.960
Well, maybe he didn't.

18:48.670 --> 18:52.131
-And the gun?
-That's the thing. It's not there.

18:52.799 --> 18:56.302
Maybe someone staying at the hotel
or working there took it.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.100
You'll let me know?

19:03.184 --> 19:04.977
Yeah. Sure.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.492
[Frank] Mark...

19:21.452 --> 19:24.831
the vice president and I
have discussed it and...

19:24.914 --> 19:26.999
we've come around to your position.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.209
Very good.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.963
Uh, considering the news that's breaking,
it's not going to be quite as easy.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.298
Any idea where this story came from?

19:34.381 --> 19:36.633
No, not yet. But I will soon.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.635
I'll let it be known that
you're open to censure.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.054
And you should be aware.

19:40.930 --> 19:41.931
It's not surprising.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.934
Romero is moving over
to the Judiciary Committee.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.602
Well, why wouldn't he?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.771
He wants to see this through.
He's still coming after me.

19:48.855 --> 19:52.566
Hmm, well, I imagine leadership
from both parties has had enough of him.

19:52.649 --> 19:56.738
Yeah, I don't want to diminish this.
We are in damage control.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.614
Claire, I think...

19:58.698 --> 20:02.284
it might be best for you
to stay out of this as much as possible.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.662
No, I... I will defend the president.

20:05.747 --> 20:08.750
Vice presidential business as usual
is the way to play it, I think.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.086
You need to trust my instincts
on this one.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.629
-Okay.
-[Frank] Thank you, Mark.

20:13.713 --> 20:14.797
Thank you.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.805
You may not always agree with him,
but you like him.

20:22.889 --> 20:23.890
I like his clarity.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.392
Let's just not forget, his candidate lost.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.643
And now he works for you.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.604
No, I think he's really working for you,
isn't he?

20:30.687 --> 20:32.064
Don't get paranoid, Francis.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.983
If not now, when?

20:56.672 --> 20:58.299
You have to go.

21:01.468 --> 21:03.054
I what?

21:03.137 --> 21:04.972
You need to leave.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.686
What's happened?

21:14.731 --> 21:16.943
There's just no place for you
here anymore.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.406
Have you been thinking about this?

21:23.449 --> 21:24.450
Yes.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.751
I don't agree.

21:34.836 --> 21:36.921
I'm completely clear about it.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.600
You can finish your coffee.

21:53.395 --> 21:54.688
Wow.

22:00.111 --> 22:01.612
How do you do that?

22:06.617 --> 22:10.329
Just... turn off like that?

22:14.458 --> 22:15.960
Please go, Tom.

22:19.755 --> 22:20.965
Go.

22:23.675 --> 22:24.760
Okay.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.640
If that's what you choose.

22:33.810 --> 22:34.811
[bangs table]

22:36.855 --> 22:37.856
[sighs]

22:39.358 --> 22:40.985
[breathes deeply]

22:51.245 --> 22:52.246
Join us?

22:52.329 --> 22:55.082
No, I'm trying not to wear out
the new model.

22:55.166 --> 22:58.335
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?

22:58.419 --> 23:00.504
Well, I'll get right to it, Frank. Um...

23:01.422 --> 23:05.301
[sighs] Well, for once,
the House Republicans...

23:06.260 --> 23:07.719
are getting something done.

23:07.803 --> 23:11.098
And the bad news is,
is that thing is impeaching you.

23:11.182 --> 23:14.851
Oh, I think the judiciary is a long way
from making any sort of decision.

23:14.936 --> 23:17.313
[Bob] They're sending articles
of impeachment to the House

23:17.396 --> 23:19.190
in the next few days, I'm told.

23:19.273 --> 23:22.443
[Womack] And that news this morning is
just adding fuel to the fire.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.736
Jesus Christ.

23:25.487 --> 23:28.865
And I'm here to ask if you...

23:32.828 --> 23:34.330
[Bob sighs]

23:34.413 --> 23:37.749
Would you consider resigning instead
of dragging this through the Senate?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.293
[chuckles]

23:40.044 --> 23:41.963
Have the two of you lost your minds?

23:42.046 --> 23:44.923
And you, Terry,
you're under investigation yourself

23:45.007 --> 23:47.676
and you dare come here and ask me this?

23:47.759 --> 23:49.595
I've often hated your guts,

23:49.678 --> 23:52.014
but I have to admit, I'll miss you.

23:52.098 --> 23:55.309
Oh, Bob, in case you've forgotten,
the Senate is Democratic.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.894
-I won't be leaving anytime soon.
-[Bob] Oh, not you.

23:57.979 --> 24:00.397
Me. I'm getting too old for this.

24:00.481 --> 24:01.565
What?

24:02.233 --> 24:05.527
A House without Bob Birch?
It will be unrecognizable.

24:05.611 --> 24:08.030
I feel like it already is. God...

24:09.031 --> 24:10.741
Was it always this dirty?

24:12.201 --> 24:14.036
That's impossible.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.580
Were the men before us any more moral?

24:16.663 --> 24:21.085
Any more worthy of the power and position
that they had found themselves in?

24:21.168 --> 24:24.838
Any more capable of doing
a single goddamn thing for the public?

24:24.921 --> 24:26.673
Well, yes and no.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.760
History has a way
of looking better than it was.

24:29.843 --> 24:34.473
Or perhaps Shakespeare was right.
We're all just madmen leading the blind.

24:43.024 --> 24:44.358
[Seth dialing]

24:46.985 --> 24:48.904
[sniffles and clears throat]

24:52.741 --> 24:55.911
<i>Ms. Lee. This is Seth Grayson,</i>
<i>from the White House.</i>

24:58.539 --> 25:00.457
<i>Yeah, thank you for taking my call.</i>

25:02.626 --> 25:04.711
[sighs] <i>Uh... I just had a question.</i>

25:04.795 --> 25:06.380
<i>There, uh... there was a reporter.</i>

25:06.463 --> 25:08.674
<i>Give me a second.</i>
<i>Let me just check my notes.</i>

25:08.757 --> 25:12.719
<i>Um... name's Sean Jeffries.</i>

25:14.596 --> 25:17.141
<i>Yeah, he's working on a story</i>
<i>about the donor list,</i>

25:17.224 --> 25:19.851
<i>around the time</i>
<i>of the president's transplant.</i>

25:22.229 --> 25:26.024
<i>I was wondering if you could come in</i>
<i>and we can coordinate our response.</i>

25:27.651 --> 25:28.819
<i>Ms. Lee,</i>

25:28.902 --> 25:33.199
<i>we don't want people to think that</i>
<i>the president got preferential treatment.</i>

[LeAnn typing]

25:50.757 --> 25:52.259
[LeAnn over speakers] <i>Jesus.</i>

25:54.010 --> 25:56.597
<i>What the hell did you give me, Mac?</i>

25:56.680 --> 25:58.099
[LeAnn typing]

26:15.031 --> 26:16.450
[LeAnn typing]

26:20.871 --> 26:22.831
-[LeAnn] <i>Jesus.</i>
-[inhales deeply]

26:22.914 --> 26:25.041
<i>What the hell did you give me, Mac?</i>

26:27.128 --> 26:28.587
[sighs]

26:37.221 --> 26:39.515
I had a tip on where
that <i>Slugline</i> story came from.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.682
You should have called me.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.100
That wouldn't have stopped it.

26:42.184 --> 26:45.437
-Is that why you're here?
-No, I got something else.

26:45.521 --> 26:46.938
Tell me.

26:47.022 --> 26:49.358
I'd like to talk to the vice president
about it.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.942
That's not possible.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.653
Everything goes through me.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.948
Well, I didn't have a chance
to explain myself.

26:57.658 --> 26:58.950
-[grunts]
-That's too bad.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.203
What's she like?

27:02.329 --> 27:05.916
She doesn't suffer fools
and she doesn't give second chances.

27:05.999 --> 27:08.669
[Sean on laptop] <i>Well, if you can't</i>
<i>get me in to talk to her again,</i>

27:08.752 --> 27:09.753
<i>I'll find some other way.</i>

27:09.836 --> 27:11.505
<i>You're in over your head.</i>

27:12.339 --> 27:14.591
<i>Tell me what you know or move along.</i>

27:16.051 --> 27:17.303
[Sean] <i>No.</i>

27:23.975 --> 27:26.102
[Catherine on speakers] <i>We don't,</i>
<i>Mr. Hammerschmidt.</i>

27:27.103 --> 27:29.523
<i>Whatever information you have...</i>

27:32.859 --> 27:34.736
<i>Don't call me again.</i>

27:46.457 --> 27:47.999
[Frank panting]

27:56.007 --> 27:59.928
[coughs] I was concerned
I was out of line the other night.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.179
You might have been.

28:01.263 --> 28:03.098
I'm sorry. I don't even know
what I'm saying sometimes.

28:03.181 --> 28:04.391
Forget it.

28:04.475 --> 28:05.517
-Hey, hang on a second.
-Hey.

28:05.601 --> 28:08.437
I need to tell you how I'm feeling.
The nation needs you, Mr. President.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.855
-We all need you.
-We're done for today.

28:09.938 --> 28:10.939
-No.
-No?

28:11.022 --> 28:12.941
Why don't you want to hear
what I'm trying to tell you?

28:13.024 --> 28:14.067
Listen. You-- enough.

28:14.150 --> 28:16.194
I love you. You need to know that.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.947
-[stammers] I'm only here to protect you.
-You need to calm down.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.366
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you wanna hear

28:20.449 --> 28:22.200
-what I'm telling you?
-There is nothing wrong with me.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.702
But you need to go home.

28:23.785 --> 28:27.038
You reached out to me.
You brought me in. I--

28:27.122 --> 28:28.332
Enough.

28:34.421 --> 28:35.672
[knock on door]

28:37.508 --> 28:39.468
-I'm sorry.
-He's out.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.677
I'll come back later.

28:40.761 --> 28:42.554
Whatever it is, I can give it to him.

28:44.681 --> 28:47.226
You can trust me to hand it over, Doug.

28:59.821 --> 29:02.366
-You weren't directed to follow Tom Yates.
-Yes, I was.

29:03.617 --> 29:06.245
According to the president,
everyone needs to be watched.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.205
Tom's not even here anymore.

29:09.956 --> 29:11.583
Francis asked you to follow him?

29:21.051 --> 29:23.262
I'm concerned about someone.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.390
Laura Moretti.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.646
I know about her... and her husband.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.024
Your behavior shows poor judgment, Doug,

29:36.107 --> 29:38.527
and could be a liability
for the president.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.029
Yes, ma'am.

29:42.238 --> 29:44.491
Give these to Francis when he gets back.

29:57.879 --> 29:59.548
I can get you immunity.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.550
You just need to tell the truth.

30:01.633 --> 30:02.634
[whispering indistinctly]

30:02.718 --> 30:05.053
Confirm that all
of Walker's testimony is true.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.555
[whispers] You don't have to do it.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.933
No, Maureen, I want this on the record.

30:10.016 --> 30:12.561
How dare you betray
the Underwoods like this?

30:12.644 --> 30:14.855
We're done here, Congressman.

30:14.938 --> 30:17.023
Well, thank you for your time.

30:17.733 --> 30:18.900
So you're prepared,

30:18.984 --> 30:22.278
a subpoena will be coming soon
from the Judiciary Committee.

30:26.450 --> 30:27.868
Madam Secretary.

31:00.609 --> 31:01.943
[Laura sighs]

31:02.027 --> 31:03.612
[Laura] Do you wanna come in?

31:09.743 --> 31:11.870
I'm the reason your husband's dead.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.710
I forced the Secretary
of Health and Human Services...

31:20.128 --> 31:23.549
to put Francis Underwood
in front of him on the donor list.

31:30.431 --> 31:32.891
I understand if you think I'm a monster.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.563
But I'd do it again.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.318
To save the president, I'd do anything.

31:48.699 --> 31:51.076
You really think that I didn't know, Doug?

31:55.414 --> 31:57.165
The timing gave it away.

31:59.626 --> 32:01.753
Come on. Come on in.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.135
What did you think was going on here?

32:10.762 --> 32:11.763
Huh?

32:13.264 --> 32:17.268
I'm not fucking you because I like you.
I'm fucking you because I hate you.

32:19.270 --> 32:20.396
Get out.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.941
Get out of my car.

32:23.024 --> 32:25.193
Get the fuck out of my car.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.821
Get out! [panting]

32:31.241 --> 32:32.868
[panting heavily]

32:44.755 --> 32:46.840
[rapid knocking on door]

32:57.183 --> 32:58.184
[door closes]

33:05.066 --> 33:06.693
What did Macallan give you?

33:07.903 --> 33:10.822
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I heard you.

33:11.865 --> 33:13.784
You got something from him.

33:15.326 --> 33:16.578
What do you mean you heard me?

33:22.751 --> 33:24.085
[chuckles] Oh.

33:28.632 --> 33:30.341
Were you watching me, too?

33:30.926 --> 33:32.468
Who was he to you?

33:38.224 --> 33:39.768
Want a drink?

33:44.022 --> 33:45.398
I don't drink.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.275
Oh, right.

33:55.659 --> 33:57.077
I was with him.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.372
When I was young
and shouldn't have been with him.

34:02.498 --> 34:03.499
[exhales sharply]

34:13.009 --> 34:15.469
What gets you off, Doug?

34:16.638 --> 34:17.931
Anything?

34:20.851 --> 34:22.978
If Macallan gave you something,
we should hand it over.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.860
Did you like it?

34:31.695 --> 34:32.946
What?

34:34.697 --> 34:36.157
Watching me.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.206
Yes.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.422
You liked what you saw?

34:55.135 --> 34:57.178
That why you came here?

35:09.983 --> 35:11.151
Well, then.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.285
[Doug breathes shakily]

35:44.142 --> 35:45.686
[both breathing heavily]

35:47.312 --> 35:49.230
[LeAnn breathing heavily over speakers]

35:51.316 --> 35:54.402
Going to the gym.
Run off some of this stress.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.238
Where's your trainer?

35:57.322 --> 36:01.409
Oh, he won't be coming around for a while.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.414
He did have a facial expression
I won't miss.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.125
Is that so?

36:09.209 --> 36:12.587
Hmm. Sort of perma-smile.
It was creepy.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.298
Maybe he's just happy.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.302
Happiness isn't my concern.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.847
Not now, not ever.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.397
[Davis] It's a tragic situation, Claire.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.900
-I know.
-I could show you what's happening.

36:33.984 --> 36:35.401
I've seen the images.

36:35.485 --> 36:39.530
It's important people know
what's going on in Homs.

36:39.614 --> 36:43.326
-Are you having second thoughts?
-It's just the timing isn't right yet.

36:43.409 --> 36:45.996
Because your husband
doesn't have the support.

36:46.079 --> 36:47.288
We need to make a case.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.540
Prepare the world
for when you make a statement.

36:49.624 --> 36:52.961
I think Francis needs to be
front and center on this.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.590
You never found out
what Macallan told Petrov?

36:58.424 --> 37:01.427
My sources say
he never gave him anything concrete.

37:01.511 --> 37:04.472
-Well, he gave LeAnn something.
-Well, that was our hope.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.642
Maybe it's time to invite her back in.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.271
Maybe.
I need to get back upstairs.

37:11.354 --> 37:14.190
The next time we meet
will be in my office.

37:15.776 --> 37:19.070
I... I don't think your husband should be
front and center.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.074
I think it should be you.

37:24.617 --> 37:27.954
-I didn't ask you what you think.
-You need to be armed, Claire.

37:28.579 --> 37:32.417
It's important that you can walk away
from anything that happens to him.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.470
[woman on speakers] <i>They can kiss my ass.</i>

Hey.

39:02.215 --> 39:05.551
-[cell phone vibrates]
-Don't worry. This never happened.

39:06.636 --> 39:08.346
You don't have to tell me.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.560
-Doug.
-Shit.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.188
Should I come in?

39:18.814 --> 39:21.692
No. Not until you give me what you've got.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.366
Mr. President.

39:28.449 --> 39:32.745
[Frank] "A source
deep within the White House...

39:34.289 --> 39:39.419
confirms President Underwood used
questionable intelligence

39:39.502 --> 39:45.008
to justify voting center closures,
which threw the election into chaos."

39:47.718 --> 39:49.054
Who do you think it is?

39:51.514 --> 39:53.141
Green, probably.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.977
-We overestimated his loyalty.
-I see.

39:58.146 --> 39:59.397
I mean...

40:00.606 --> 40:01.857
who else could it be?

40:04.319 --> 40:05.320
How can I help?

40:06.654 --> 40:09.324
We need to save ourselves here.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.868
-It's as much your head as mine, Cathy.
-I understand.

40:31.262 --> 40:35.016
I need you to create additional documents
that justify going after Kalabi.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.310
A paper trail that will

40:37.393 --> 40:41.064
support our actions that we took
on Election Day in Tennessee.

40:41.772 --> 40:44.109
I'm not sure...

40:44.192 --> 40:46.444
what those documents would be.

40:46.527 --> 40:49.114
Well, but you're smart, Cathy, aren't you?
I mean, you can figure it out.

40:49.197 --> 40:51.824
Why don't you just show me
how smart you are.

40:54.035 --> 40:57.538
-Of course, Mr. President.
-And the presentation at the UN.

40:58.623 --> 41:00.583
-With Syria?
-It needs to happen.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.629
-Very well.
-There's a possibility of talks,

41:04.712 --> 41:08.341
but we need to get all
the interested parties back to the table.

41:08.424 --> 41:09.592
Of course.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.764
You're a good diplomat, Cathy.

41:15.890 --> 41:17.850
Thank you, Mr. President.

41:17.933 --> 41:19.894
And where is Claire?

41:19.978 --> 41:22.105
She needed a little distance right now.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.815
Till we find out what's happening with me.

41:26.026 --> 41:29.570
That's why I need
to rely on you, Cathy. Now.

41:33.366 --> 41:36.036
Well, I'm glad you feel that way, Francis.

42:02.895 --> 42:05.856
Yes. I'm ready to meet.

42:05.940 --> 42:08.401
I wanna meet now. Right now.

-What the hell are you talking about?

-I'm deputy press secretary.
-The fuck you are.

42:49.024 --> 42:51.527
I got a call from the vice president's
office, asking me to come in.

42:51.611 --> 42:53.404
And when I got here,
this was waiting for me.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.698
I just spent the last hour
doing my paperwork.

42:56.782 --> 42:57.950
I don't have time for this.

[newscaster] <i>President Garrett Walker's</i>
<i>bombshell testimony, which...</i>

43:00.953 --> 43:04.665
I have Secretary Durant's resignation.
I believe she was the leak,

43:04.749 --> 43:08.128
and might have to take responsibility
for whatever happened on election night.

43:08.211 --> 43:11.756
Sir, the judiciary could issue
a resolution for impeachment any day now.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.341
We need to be realistic

43:13.424 --> 43:16.136
about damage to the president
even if the Senate doesn't convict.

43:16.219 --> 43:17.512
[Doug] You promised us censure.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.972
Well, Durant's leak took care of that,
didn't it?

43:20.055 --> 43:21.849
So, we have a plan for the Senate.

43:21.932 --> 43:24.352
I suggest we work on protecting
the vice president.

43:25.103 --> 43:29.064
Make sure she exits
this whole process unscathed.

43:29.149 --> 43:30.608
And how do we do that?

43:31.776 --> 43:35.530
Plead ignorance. The vice president wasn't
read into anything.

43:36.239 --> 43:37.407
Didn't know anything.

43:37.490 --> 43:39.284
-Didn't do anything.
-[Seth] That won't play.

43:40.118 --> 43:42.245
She'll look uninformed,
and the people know she isn't.

43:42.328 --> 43:44.497
[Mark] Oh, the distance will help her
look innocent.

43:44.580 --> 43:48.209
Innocent, guilty,
capable, incompetent, whatever it is...

43:48.293 --> 43:51.379
the public is going to think the opposite.

43:51.962 --> 43:54.132
So, really there is no winning.

43:55.049 --> 43:56.551
Whatever you think is best.

43:56.634 --> 43:59.137
You're gonna have four years
to prove yourself

43:59.220 --> 44:02.097
on the inside if I'm acquitted.
Hopefully, eight.

44:02.182 --> 44:04.225
But what happens if I'm not acquitted?

44:04.309 --> 44:05.476
We don't have to deal with that right now.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.353
No, I want to hear a plan.
That's why you're here.

44:07.437 --> 44:08.854

Oh, your calculus is as good as mine,
Mr. President.

44:11.607 --> 44:13.067

44:39.802 --> 44:42.805
I wanted you to know, sir, that she knows.

-That's not possible.
-I threatened her, sir.

44:54.734 --> 44:58.738
It was an unprecedented ethical violation.
But I don't regret it.

45:01.491 --> 45:04.118
I kept it to myself, so that you would...

45:04.702 --> 45:07.037
have plausible deniability
if anyone found out.

45:08.122 --> 45:10.082

45:10.958 --> 45:12.209
She learned another way.

45:13.168 --> 45:15.296
She knew and didn't tell me.

45:16.297 --> 45:17.298
Seems so.

45:19.717 --> 45:21.594
And how did she react
to the Yates surveillance?

45:21.677 --> 45:23.346
What did she say about that?

45:23.929 --> 45:25.973
She didn't show her feelings to me, sir.

Hmm.

45:41.281 --> 45:42.490
Always.

Do you have concerns about Mrs. Underwood?

45:49.914 --> 45:52.333
-Do you?
-I would never say that.

45:54.544 --> 45:56.629

get some rest, sir.
