WEBVTT

00:01.834 --> 00:03.292
We've got
Michelle and her girlfriends.

00:03.292 --> 00:05.083
Ten years as E.R. physicians.

00:05.083 --> 00:06.125
We ran a pod in
the E.R. together.

00:06.125 --> 00:07.417
It's so great.

00:07.417 --> 00:08.959
It's always good to have
friends at work.

00:08.959 --> 00:12.334
I'm dressing up.

00:12.334 --> 00:13.250
Shut up.

00:13.250 --> 00:16.459
I do enjoy the company
of the fairer sex.

00:16.459 --> 00:20.959
Sex being the operative word.

00:20.959 --> 00:23.083
I don't think Tony's realized
what yachting is all about.

00:23.083 --> 00:24.501
This is my punishment.

00:24.501 --> 00:26.626
It's a mother----er
and it will get you.

00:26.626 --> 00:28.250
[bleep] me.

00:28.250 --> 00:30.083
This morning, everything's numb.

00:30.083 --> 00:32.792
Pain's getting worse.
Not better.

00:32.792 --> 00:37.209
That was the wrong thing to do.

00:37.209 --> 00:40.375
...with the guests.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.000
I don't know
where the coolers are.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.417
I never heard
anything about the coolers.

00:47.417 --> 00:48.042
Oh, no.

00:48.042 --> 00:49.584
You cannot send the guests

00:49.584 --> 01:00.167
-without those coolers.
-God damn it.

01:00.167 --> 01:01.584
Get that blue cooler.

01:01.584 --> 01:09.792
Look and see if there's
wine and stuff in it.

01:09.792 --> 01:10.959
----ing rolling.

01:10.959 --> 01:14.083
-Was there wine in it?
-Yeah.

01:14.083 --> 01:20.000
Wow. Right where
I said they were.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.709
Ladies, hold on to your hat.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.250
God damn it.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.834
So housekeeping is what we'll
do until they get back.

01:27.834 --> 01:29.209
Okay.

01:29.209 --> 01:30.542
-Went on wild goose hunt...
-Where was it?

01:30.542 --> 01:39.250
-It was literally in the...
-Lazaret?

01:39.250 --> 01:40.584
Woo!

01:40.584 --> 01:43.792
Lunch is ready,
if you'd like to follow me.

01:43.792 --> 01:45.375
We're going to bread this.

01:45.375 --> 01:47.751
Let's go ahead and put
the sauces on the table now.

01:47.751 --> 01:50.459
-Do you want to?
-No, I'm not on service.

01:50.459 --> 01:53.167
Who's on service right now?
It's you two, right?

01:53.167 --> 01:55.959
No, I'm here to assist
with the decking.

01:55.959 --> 01:57.292
We're all on service.
That's what I was going to say.

01:57.292 --> 01:58.626
Got it.

01:58.626 --> 02:02.083
When there's three people on
the beach, we're all on service.

02:02.083 --> 02:05.083
Sorry, baby. You can't
stand around and not do sh--.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.626
I'm so over being fake nice.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.292
It's literally slowly
poisoning my ----ing soul.

02:09.292 --> 02:15.125
Would you like some melon?

02:15.125 --> 02:18.876
Chef Rachel!

02:18.876 --> 02:21.959
Okay. I don't know how to
react to stuff like that.

02:21.959 --> 02:23.459
I had a muffin today, right?

02:23.459 --> 02:27.042
I just went for the top,
wait for it, and I was like

02:27.042 --> 02:29.209
-and I ate the rest.
-You ate the rest of it?

02:29.209 --> 02:31.167
-You know how ----ing--
-Did you eat it off the floor?

02:31.167 --> 02:33.167
No, but now I've had
a ----ing muffin.

02:33.167 --> 02:34.959
So I won't be eating
the rest of the month.

02:34.959 --> 02:37.000
[laughing]

02:37.000 --> 02:38.792
St. David,
St. David, shore party.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.584
-Go ahead.
-I
'm ready to be tendered back

02:40.584 --> 02:43.250
-in with a couple of items.
-C
opy that.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.083
I will be honest,
I don't think I would make

02:45.083 --> 02:46.584
it without Michelle sometimes.

02:46.584 --> 02:47.918
Aw...

02:47.918 --> 02:50.792
-She's all right.
-[laughing]

02:50.792 --> 02:52.209
There we go.

02:52.209 --> 02:53.667
I'm going to
start clearing the table.

02:53.667 --> 02:56.501
Just made my day, not
having to clean that up.

02:56.501 --> 03:02.250
-Can I clear your plate?
-Yeah, please. Thank you.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.167
Are you going back
with you for the dessert?

03:04.167 --> 03:07.250
Straight back with the desserts?
Yeah.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.751
-Good to go?
-Yeah.

03:08.751 --> 03:14.584
All right.

03:14.584 --> 03:28.375
Alissa, can you throw me
a bottle of water please?

03:28.375 --> 03:29.959
I want to let
you know what's happening.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.542
Camille, even out
on the beach,

03:31.542 --> 03:33.626
the comments I'm just
taking over control for myself.

03:33.626 --> 03:35.167
This is what I'm doing.

03:35.167 --> 03:37.250
But she's also gone off
on Alissa as well already

03:37.250 --> 03:38.792
when Alissa
was trying to delegate

03:38.792 --> 03:40.250
something
to her and I walked by.

03:40.250 --> 03:43.042
She has specific instructions
throughout the day.

03:43.042 --> 03:44.709
Yeah, we just
need to figure it out.

03:44.709 --> 03:46.584
She's not doing
what's being asked of her,

03:46.584 --> 03:49.584
because what's being
asked of her is very clear.

03:49.584 --> 03:52.584
It's not a good look
that another department

03:52.584 --> 03:56.375
has seen fault
in a member of my team.

03:56.375 --> 03:58.334
Not good.

03:58.334 --> 04:00.959
-Okay, brilliant.
-Okay.

04:00.959 --> 04:01.959
Yes. This is...

04:01.959 --> 04:02.959
Yes.

04:02.959 --> 04:04.375
Oh, great.

04:04.375 --> 04:06.375
She's not cleaned
the ----ing iron.

04:06.375 --> 04:09.834
She's really got under
my skin there, that girl.

04:09.834 --> 04:13.250
We've got a passion fruit sorbet
that is melting as we speak.

04:13.250 --> 04:14.792
The looks amazing.

04:14.792 --> 04:18.501
Oh, my God.
That's... my love language.

04:18.501 --> 04:23.125
-Back to Hoovering.
-Hoover away.

04:23.125 --> 04:26.959
I think it sucks.

04:26.959 --> 04:28.792
-Really?
-Yeah.

04:28.792 --> 04:30.250
Motor Yacht St. David,
Alissa,

04:30.250 --> 04:32.626
the guests are
ready to go back.

04:32.626 --> 04:34.292
Copy, Alissa,
we're on our way.

04:34.292 --> 04:36.042
All right,
will you hop off?

04:36.042 --> 04:37.501
Tenders on their way back.

04:37.501 --> 04:39.626
Should be here in
5, 10 minutes for you guys.

04:39.626 --> 04:41.626
Alissa, Alissa, Fraser.

04:41.626 --> 04:45.250
I'll leave Camille
to pack away.

04:45.250 --> 04:46.667
Just get this off the bar.

04:46.667 --> 04:47.918
This is trash.

04:47.918 --> 04:49.167
Hi. Is that all?

04:49.167 --> 04:51.042
-This is what's important, yeah.
-Okay.

04:51.042 --> 04:54.334
-There we go.
-Amazing!

04:54.334 --> 04:55.959
Just haven't stopped.

04:55.959 --> 04:56.959
What's up with you?

04:56.959 --> 04:58.334
Just tired.

04:58.334 --> 05:00.959
Tony, why do we agree
to these beach picnics?

05:00.959 --> 05:02.792
Because it's not a democracy.

05:02.792 --> 05:05.167
We live in a dictatorship
where we have

05:05.167 --> 05:07.125
someone who says, do it,
and we have to do it.

05:07.125 --> 05:08.375
I don't remember
when was the last

05:08.375 --> 05:10.250
time that I have a voice,
you know?

05:10.250 --> 05:12.959
Hello.
Hello. Welcome back.

05:12.959 --> 05:14.375
Thank you.

05:14.375 --> 05:16.918
That's what
I'm talking about, right?

05:16.918 --> 05:18.125
Can you massage it?

05:18.125 --> 05:19.626
I could literally
sleep out here.

05:19.626 --> 05:24.167
That's some
romantic sh-- right there.

05:24.167 --> 05:25.459
Interior.
Interior.

05:25.459 --> 05:30.792
Can you get into
your blacks, please?

05:30.792 --> 05:32.042
Lord help me.

05:32.042 --> 05:34.834
We need to get the hell
out of this place.

05:34.834 --> 05:38.375
Hey, hold on.

05:38.375 --> 05:41.709
Mr. Olender. Swing
by my quarters, please.

05:41.709 --> 05:42.918
Yeah, I will. Now.

05:42.918 --> 05:45.959
One, two, three.

05:45.959 --> 05:48.042
I think that was perfect.

05:48.042 --> 05:49.459
-Get it, girl!
-[bleep]

05:49.459 --> 05:50.792
What's going on there?

05:50.792 --> 05:52.501
Woo!

05:52.501 --> 05:55.459
We have dinner at 8:30,
but knowing these ladies,

05:55.459 --> 05:57.167
we're going to be looking at
a little bit closer to nine.

05:57.167 --> 05:58.542
With the rock and rolling,

05:58.542 --> 06:00.167
I'll probably
use the crutches tonight.

06:00.167 --> 06:01.626
The cane's not all that stable.

06:01.626 --> 06:03.959
I hate to do a one
and a half on the way out.

06:03.959 --> 06:06.584
-Don't need that.
-My injury, it's getting worse.

06:06.584 --> 06:10.167
The left side of my body,
I don't feel anything.

06:10.167 --> 06:11.501
I'm probably just going to

06:11.501 --> 06:12.792
go on black
epaulets and shirts.

06:12.792 --> 06:14.375
Like what you're wearing.

06:14.375 --> 06:17.501
I expected a lot more progress
than I'm experiencing.

06:17.501 --> 06:19.250
And the most
frustrating part about it

06:19.250 --> 06:22.250
is I can't do a God damn
thing about it.

06:22.250 --> 06:23.501
That's hard.

06:23.501 --> 06:25.167
-Thank you, sir.
-No, thank you.

06:25.167 --> 06:28.125
-You're welcome.
-See you later.

06:28.125 --> 06:29.626
What the [bleep] was that?

06:29.626 --> 06:31.876
I'm in a shower,
then come up to your room.

06:31.876 --> 06:33.083
Camille, Camille,
Fraser.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.459
Hey, can I get
you in laundry, please?

06:34.459 --> 06:35.667
No problem.

06:35.667 --> 06:36.959
Haley, Haley, Fraser.

06:36.959 --> 06:37.959
Can you just help
with the table?

06:37.959 --> 06:40.709
Okay, cool.
Thank you.

06:40.709 --> 06:41.959
-Frase.
-Yeah.

06:41.959 --> 06:43.584
-What time is dinner?
-Realistically?

06:43.584 --> 06:45.334
We're looking
around about 09:00.

06:45.334 --> 06:47.250
-That is one dirty boat.
-Yeah.

06:47.250 --> 06:50.792
Deck crew, deck crew,
I've got beach towels in here.

06:50.792 --> 06:51.959
Where's in here?

06:51.959 --> 06:53.542
Sorry, I thought
everyone understood

06:53.542 --> 06:54.959
that I'm always in laundry.

06:54.959 --> 06:56.751
Oh, my ----ing...

06:56.751 --> 06:57.834
Oh, dig.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.792
That attitude
over the radio.

06:59.792 --> 07:01.918
Yeah, it's not good.

07:01.918 --> 07:05.417
You guys ready?

07:05.417 --> 07:06.584
[shouting]

07:06.584 --> 07:09.959
Let's just go and have
some showers and some food.

07:09.959 --> 07:11.626
Perfect.
Because I'm dirty.

07:11.626 --> 07:13.709
Yeah, you are.

07:13.709 --> 07:15.792
Ross definitely has
that sweet personality.

07:15.792 --> 07:17.167
He's funny.

07:17.167 --> 07:19.125
It's fun to have
someone you connect with.

07:19.125 --> 07:20.584
In Miami, when it
comes to dating,

07:20.584 --> 07:22.334
you're either dealing with
[bleep] boys

07:22.334 --> 07:24.584
and just want to hook up
or you're dealing with people

07:24.584 --> 07:27.959
that have lots of money and
that will [bleep] around on you.

07:27.959 --> 07:30.292
Ross is just like
super genuine and I like that.

07:30.292 --> 07:33.292
Your room is so big.
So many room for activities.

07:33.292 --> 07:34.959
There is a lot of room
for activity.

07:34.959 --> 07:39.042
There is.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.042
-Thank you.
-Good night.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.083
See you tomorrow.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.375
Okay. This for your soup.

07:42.375 --> 07:43.959
Is that going to be okay?
Please say okay.

07:43.959 --> 07:46.959
Yeah. These guests, every single
day, they're saving lives.

07:46.959 --> 07:49.501
So in order for
them to feel honored,

07:49.501 --> 07:51.959
let's dedicate
each course

07:51.959 --> 07:54.751
to all of these beautiful,
amazing heroes.

07:54.751 --> 07:57.042
I'm going to go ahead
and start doing the sashimi.

07:57.042 --> 07:58.042
[bleep] You've got a
big evening.

07:58.042 --> 08:00.167
Charter one was not so much fun.

08:00.167 --> 08:01.792
Let's make two not like poo.

08:01.792 --> 08:03.959
All right. Let's do this.
You son of a bitch.

08:03.959 --> 08:05.959
Oh, it's so pretty!

08:05.959 --> 08:08.334
Rachel, I've just
sat everyone at the table.

08:08.334 --> 08:11.959
Haley and Camille,
go down to cabins.

08:11.959 --> 08:12.959
How are we doing?

08:12.959 --> 08:14.167
It's been a struggle.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.792
We're ready when you are.

08:15.792 --> 08:17.959
See if I can get out there
without embarrassing anyone.

08:17.959 --> 08:20.000
Fine.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.375
Oh, [bleep].

08:21.375 --> 08:23.375
What time are you going
to bed tonight, do you know?

08:23.375 --> 08:24.959
I think I'm on lates again.

08:24.959 --> 08:26.501
-What, with Alissa?
-Yeah.

08:26.501 --> 08:29.417
She drives me nuts and
I'm just getting sick of it.

08:29.417 --> 08:30.792
-Yeah.
-I know you weren't there today,

08:30.792 --> 08:32.167
but I practically ran around

08:32.167 --> 08:33.501
with the chicken
with my head cut off.

08:33.501 --> 08:35.959
Do you feel jobs
are getting muddled?

08:35.959 --> 08:37.459
-It's getting muddled.
-Yeah.

08:37.459 --> 08:39.918
I feel like
I'm that person that people

08:39.918 --> 08:42.000
just naturally want to vent to.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.751
All I can really say is just
talk to each other but also,

08:45.751 --> 08:50.125
like, it's kind of annoying
but addictive at the same time.

08:50.125 --> 08:51.667
Who's going to win?

08:51.667 --> 08:53.792
If there's an issue, you
need to talk about it, yeah?

08:53.792 --> 08:56.250
Right, I'm going to
talk to Fraser about it.

08:56.250 --> 08:59.417
He will deal
with it in whatever way

08:59.417 --> 09:02.959
he will find most appropriate.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.584
Coming up...

09:04.584 --> 09:06.083
Take it up,
take it up.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.125
Hold it.
Hold it.

09:07.125 --> 09:08.626
You're going to lose that.

09:08.626 --> 09:10.292
Take the God damn slack up
on the bow line.

09:10.292 --> 09:12.042
-Hold it, hold it.
-You're going to lose it.

09:12.042 --> 09:17.709
Son of a bitch!

09:17.709 --> 09:19.250
My, my, my.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.417
-Captain Lee!
-Good evening.

09:21.417 --> 09:23.250
Captain!

09:23.250 --> 09:25.250
How the hell
did I get this lucky?

09:25.250 --> 09:28.167
Do you need a doctor?

09:28.167 --> 09:29.542
The guests want me for dinner.

09:29.542 --> 09:31.501
They're going to
have to take me as I am.

09:31.501 --> 09:33.834
I don't have to put
my puppy ass on the porch.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.375
I can run with the big dogs.

09:35.375 --> 09:40.375
I don't know how long,
but for a night? I can hang.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.042
Thank you for joining us.

09:42.042 --> 09:44.000
It really is my pleasure.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.250
We are beyond honored.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.250
The honor is mine,
I assure you.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.292
Rachel, Rachel, Fraser.

09:48.292 --> 09:50.000
Captain Lee's seated.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.125
We're ready for the first
course whenever you are.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.626
-Copy that, thank you.
-C
an I touch your...

09:53.626 --> 09:54.667
Yeah, sure.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.209
I've been wanting to do
that for a long time.

09:56.209 --> 09:57.584
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

09:57.584 --> 09:59.876
Yeah. It matched
my expectations.

09:59.876 --> 10:02.501
And I'm going to ask you to do
that in like a couple of days.

10:02.501 --> 10:09.167
Okay. Excellent.

10:09.167 --> 10:11.292
That looks
absolutely breathtaking.

10:11.292 --> 10:13.542
The courses this evening
are from each

10:13.542 --> 10:16.751
lady's preference sheet
showcasing...

10:16.751 --> 10:18.417
-Cool.
-Their requests.

10:18.417 --> 10:19.792
I love that.
Brilliant.

10:19.792 --> 10:22.667
This first course is
dedicated to the primary

10:22.667 --> 10:24.417
and her love of sashimi.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.125
Brilliant.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.125
Good evening, ladies.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.459
So your final evening,

10:28.459 --> 10:29.709
we're going to make this
very special.

10:29.709 --> 10:31.375
Every course
is going to be dedicated

10:31.375 --> 10:33.501
to a specific guest member.

10:33.501 --> 10:37.250
Is dessert gonna be
you, Captain?

10:37.250 --> 10:42.375
I think I'm shvitzing.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.542
First is to our
wonderful primary

10:45.542 --> 10:47.959
for her love for sashimi.
Enjoy.

10:47.959 --> 10:49.959
-Thank you.
-Oh my gosh.

10:49.959 --> 10:51.501
That's amazing.

10:51.501 --> 10:52.751
Whoa!

10:52.751 --> 10:53.959
Oh, wow.

10:53.959 --> 10:55.167
Mmm.

10:55.167 --> 10:56.876
Great.
I'm over this tonight.

10:56.876 --> 10:59.918
Chef Rachel, they are
blown away by the idea.

10:59.918 --> 11:02.417
-Well done.
-T
hank you so much, Fraser.

11:02.417 --> 11:04.584
Are we allowed to
ask how you hurt your leg?

11:04.584 --> 11:07.834
It's a nerve issue
and will be resolved soon.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.167
Okay, good.

11:09.167 --> 11:10.792
We just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

11:10.792 --> 11:12.709
I am.

11:12.709 --> 11:14.334
Deck crew, I don't know if
you're aware it's raining.

11:14.334 --> 11:16.626
Roscoe, we're on it.
Thank you.

11:16.626 --> 11:18.375
I like calling his Roscoe,
I don't know why.

11:18.375 --> 11:23.042
I know.

11:23.042 --> 11:26.501
Fraser, Fraser.
The cabins are finished.

11:26.501 --> 11:28.334
So I'm going to go down.

11:28.334 --> 11:31.918
-You can go down.
-Thank you.

11:31.918 --> 11:34.125
Second course, a ceviche.

11:34.125 --> 11:35.709
Tell me who this course is for.

11:35.709 --> 11:38.375
Samantha.

11:38.375 --> 11:43.918
-Flashing my cooter.
-My cooter.

11:43.918 --> 11:45.584
Oops, sorry.

11:45.584 --> 11:49.000
Next course is dedicated
to the wonderful

11:49.000 --> 11:53.167
Samantha and
her love for fresh fish.

11:53.167 --> 11:55.209
-Enjoy.
-Love it.

11:55.209 --> 11:57.918
-Thank you.
-This is going to be a treat.

11:57.918 --> 12:01.584
Ceviche.

12:01.584 --> 12:03.375
[bleep]
Dude.

12:03.375 --> 12:04.417
How are we looking
on service?

12:04.417 --> 12:07.250
They are going wild over it.

12:07.250 --> 12:10.209
I have not laughed as
hard as I have laughed

12:10.209 --> 12:13.209
in the last two days,
in the last two years.

12:13.209 --> 12:15.000
-Isn't it great?
-And that laughter was

12:15.000 --> 12:16.501
what I needed in my soul.

12:16.501 --> 12:18.417
We are all in this together.

12:18.417 --> 12:23.459
You run a ship or a yacht and
we run an E.R. full of patients.

12:23.459 --> 12:26.375
-That's stress.
-It's super stressful.

12:26.375 --> 12:30.167
-We rely on each other.
-You all have that together.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.542
Which is...

12:31.542 --> 12:33.876
I mean, just think about
how unique that is.

12:33.876 --> 12:35.792
Oh, so unusual.

12:35.792 --> 12:38.626
Captain, we appreciate it.
We appreciate it.

12:38.626 --> 12:39.584
As you should.

12:39.584 --> 12:43.000
The truffle wagyu.
This is going to Shauna.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.792
Our next course wagyu
beef for the wonderful Shauna.

12:47.792 --> 12:51.042
Shauna!

12:51.042 --> 12:53.751
Enjoy your meal.

12:53.751 --> 12:56.792
Fabulous reception.
We had tears. It was beautiful.

12:56.792 --> 12:59.876
Okay, kids, all your whites
are ready for tomorrow.

12:59.876 --> 13:01.876
The lobster and mango.

13:01.876 --> 13:05.959
This one is dedicated
to Tola.

13:05.959 --> 13:09.375
This dish is
a Caribbean lobster in

13:09.375 --> 13:12.042
a mango sauce
for our wonderful Tola.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.959
Aw...

13:13.959 --> 13:17.250
Thank you.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.751
This was amazing. I mean,
it was everything.

13:19.751 --> 13:21.792
It just really
makes me choke up.

13:21.792 --> 13:24.959
It's so difficult what you do,
and just to be able

13:24.959 --> 13:29.167
to get you away from all of
that and have you really just

13:29.167 --> 13:31.459
cut loose and have some fun.

13:31.459 --> 13:34.000
If you make me cry,
I'll never forgive you.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.876
-Cheers to that.
-Cheers.

13:35.876 --> 13:37.209
Cheers.

13:37.209 --> 13:40.000
I find it inspiring to
be around these people.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.375
I mean, how many people can ever

13:41.375 --> 13:43.250
say they've saved
somebody's life?

13:43.250 --> 13:47.292
And these guys do it every day.
I love them.

13:47.292 --> 13:51.167
I wore my old ass out.

13:51.167 --> 13:53.125
Thank you, sir.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.959
What do you think
about lates?

13:55.959 --> 13:57.209
No different.

13:57.209 --> 13:58.584
Even with docking
tomorrow morning?

13:58.584 --> 14:00.542
I'll probably be up
'til like two

14:00.542 --> 14:03.375
and I have to be on deck
at 7:20.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.792
-Yeah.
-I'm just saying...

14:05.792 --> 14:08.334
I just want
to be rested for it because

14:08.334 --> 14:10.083
it's like...
but it's okay.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.584
Sure.
You can go down now.

14:11.584 --> 14:12.501
Okay.

14:12.501 --> 14:15.959
I understand
she has a tricky role and

14:15.959 --> 14:18.626
I just am upset
and disappointed

14:18.626 --> 14:22.292
that she couldn't
see the bigger picture.

14:22.292 --> 14:25.167
That is not how a team
supports one another.

14:25.167 --> 14:28.792
Jesus Christ. I'm cutting
off my ----ing circulation.

14:28.792 --> 14:30.792
-Sorry, mate.
-Sorry.

14:30.792 --> 14:32.959
So just so you are
aware of what's going on,

14:32.959 --> 14:36.167
Camille demanded to go down
because she says she needs

14:36.167 --> 14:38.292
as much sleep as
possible for tomorrow.

14:38.292 --> 14:40.626
What is it, maybe
ten minute dockings?

14:40.626 --> 14:41.876
Yeah.

14:41.876 --> 14:43.459
Why do I do this?

14:43.459 --> 14:46.375
Going forward, would you like
a full time fifth deckie?

14:46.375 --> 14:50.792
No. The usage of her on the
first charter was about right.

14:50.792 --> 14:56.792
Floaters, they'll often use
it to their advantage.

14:56.792 --> 15:03.459
I think it's a very,
very comfortable life.

15:03.459 --> 15:05.584
I'm really at my wit's end.

15:05.584 --> 15:06.542
Coming up...

15:06.542 --> 15:06.542
Just talked to Katie,
and she likes Ross.

15:06.542 --> 15:19.501
My, my, my.

15:19.501 --> 15:22.042
He was like,
that bitch has a whip.

15:22.042 --> 15:23.792
Ooh...

15:23.792 --> 15:25.417
Ooh!

15:25.417 --> 15:26.792
Oh, yes.

15:26.792 --> 15:29.334
Babe, that bootie is delic.

15:29.334 --> 15:31.501
Oh, no, that wasn't good.
Yucky.

15:31.501 --> 15:33.417
I asked Fraser
like what he thought

15:33.417 --> 15:37.083
about me going down because
I had to be up on deck at seven.

15:37.083 --> 15:38.459
-Yeah.
-He seemed like annoyed with me.

15:38.459 --> 15:45.709
But he has Alissa now.

15:45.709 --> 15:47.542
-Bye, Angel.
-Good night. Good night.

15:47.542 --> 15:50.375
To old friends,
to new friends.

15:50.375 --> 15:53.334
To forever friends.

15:53.334 --> 15:55.417
[cheering]

15:55.417 --> 15:59.417
We are queens.

15:59.417 --> 16:03.417
Oh, what a shock.

16:03.417 --> 16:04.834
Night, loser.
Go to bed.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.876
Loser.
All right, loser.

16:06.876 --> 16:22.083
Catch ya.

16:22.083 --> 16:22.792
Oh...

16:22.792 --> 16:25.209
We keep shamming and shamming.

16:25.209 --> 16:32.375
Oh, God.

16:32.375 --> 16:34.209
-Morning.
-Good morning.

16:34.209 --> 16:39.167
-Good morning, Darling.
-Good morning, my gorgeous girl.

16:39.167 --> 16:40.667
There we go.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.584
There's no time for
setting anything up.

16:43.584 --> 16:46.083
Just got to be
ready to go from here.

16:46.083 --> 16:47.375
I'm nervous to let Katie

16:47.375 --> 16:48.959
throw a heaving line
from the bow.

16:48.959 --> 16:51.375
I'd recommend that you
throw the first line.

16:51.375 --> 16:52.626
I'll stay on the bow, yeah.

16:52.626 --> 16:55.000
Moving on to training
those two

16:55.000 --> 16:57.125
is that got to give them
that pressure

16:57.125 --> 16:59.459
-at some point, too.
-Yeah, to step up.

16:59.459 --> 17:01.417
I went to bed three hours ago.

17:01.417 --> 17:02.792
Why did you go to
bed so late?

17:02.792 --> 17:07.000
Because Camille sort
of demanded to go down.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.459
I think just going
ahead like this is

17:09.459 --> 17:10.876
something that
I need to deal with.

17:10.876 --> 17:13.626
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Stop being a little bitch.

17:13.626 --> 17:15.459
So let's all have a chat.

17:15.459 --> 17:16.459
We're going to be
doing anchoring.

17:16.459 --> 17:18.125
Ben is going to pick it up.

17:18.125 --> 17:20.501
Tony, when we do the anchoring
yet, do you want to do braking?

17:20.501 --> 17:26.375
-No problem.
-So that's that.

17:26.375 --> 17:29.083
Good morning.
How are you?

17:29.083 --> 17:31.167
-Hello, babes.
-Babes.

17:31.167 --> 17:33.375
What's going on?
Give me something to do.

17:33.375 --> 17:34.375
We have nothing to do.

17:34.375 --> 17:35.584
Everything's good.

17:35.584 --> 17:36.876
Oh, my God.
I love being on deck.

17:36.876 --> 17:38.792
Did you have a
long day yesterday?

17:38.792 --> 17:40.292
No, no.

17:40.292 --> 17:41.918
Fraser, Fraser, Rachel.

17:41.918 --> 17:43.959
The special's a
lobster benedict.

17:43.959 --> 17:45.375
Nail this docking today.

17:45.375 --> 17:46.959
What are you going to do?

17:46.959 --> 17:48.959
You're just going to do a little
bop, bop, beep, beep?

17:48.959 --> 17:49.959
Boo boo bop bop.

17:49.959 --> 17:50.626
-Hello.
-Hi.

17:50.626 --> 17:52.083
Is there anything I can get you?

17:52.083 --> 17:53.959
New left leg.
I can use one of those.

17:53.959 --> 17:56.167
-I'll let you borrow mine.
-You're so good to me.

17:56.167 --> 18:00.083
One of my biggest problems right
now is I'm not able to observe.

18:00.083 --> 18:02.042
I don't know
who's doing what.

18:02.042 --> 18:02.918
It's my job.

18:02.918 --> 18:05.083
Pain is getting worse,
not better.

18:05.083 --> 18:08.250
I owe it to my crew
to do right by them.

18:08.250 --> 18:13.626
They expect that out of me.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.834
It's there because you're
dragging it around behind you.

18:16.834 --> 18:17.626
Aw...

18:17.626 --> 18:19.459
There comes a point,
if a captain

18:19.459 --> 18:22.042
is really being objective,

18:22.042 --> 18:25.751
he should be putting the best
interests of his crew first,

18:25.751 --> 18:28.417
because that's your
primary responsibility.

18:28.417 --> 18:30.042
As soon as you step on board,

18:30.042 --> 18:31.918
check your ----ing ego
at the dock.

18:31.918 --> 18:33.250
That's where you leave it.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.709
This has probably been
one of the most humbling

18:35.709 --> 18:37.542
experiences of my life.

18:37.542 --> 18:40.167
The special is the
lobster Benedict.

18:40.167 --> 18:41.709
Can I take any orders?

18:41.709 --> 18:43.375
-Yeah, we'll have it.
-That sounds amazing.

18:43.375 --> 18:45.959
Anything from her.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.792
Captain, Captain, Ross.
Decks are set.

18:48.792 --> 18:50.375
-And we're ready to go.
-Copy that.

18:50.375 --> 18:54.167
We've got
seven lobster Benedicts.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.584
All right.

18:55.584 --> 18:57.167
Cap, Cap, Ben, you
ready to start hauling?

18:57.167 --> 18:59.417
-Roger that.
-C
opy.

18:59.417 --> 19:02.751
Ready, Tony?

19:02.751 --> 19:04.042
Would you like to come around

19:04.042 --> 19:07.792
and put this on
the platter here?

19:07.792 --> 19:09.792
Water at the anchor.

19:09.792 --> 19:13.083
We're out of here.
Everybody prepare for docking.

19:13.083 --> 19:15.042
All right?
All good. Nice work, Ben.

19:15.042 --> 19:16.792
-Thank you, Tony.
-Thanks, Katie.

19:16.792 --> 19:18.459
Thanks, Katie,
for looking good.

19:18.459 --> 19:20.584
Beautiful.

19:20.584 --> 19:22.792
Michelle's like,
I like that for sure.

19:22.792 --> 19:24.292
Nice and tidy.
I love it.

19:24.292 --> 19:26.250
Yeah. Got to keep on it.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.334
Yeah. That's the best
way of dealing with it.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.501
[glass cracks]

19:30.501 --> 19:32.167
That's not.

19:32.167 --> 19:33.584
We're not too far out.

19:33.584 --> 19:35.918
I'm going to head
to the wing station.

19:35.918 --> 19:40.167
Deck team, lower bow
fenders, please.

19:40.167 --> 19:42.501
Let me know when
to just stop it, Ben.

19:42.501 --> 19:43.709
Okay, go, Camille.

19:43.709 --> 19:45.375
Hard for me
to see with you ladies.

19:45.375 --> 19:46.375
Yes, sir.

19:46.375 --> 19:48.584
That was not good.

19:48.584 --> 19:49.709
-Bow fenders are set.
-N
o, they're not.

19:49.709 --> 19:51.083
Oh, just kidding.

19:51.083 --> 19:52.918
Can you get the aft
one lower, please?

19:52.918 --> 19:55.250
The aft fender needs
to come lower.

19:55.250 --> 19:56.417
-Aft?
-Yeah.

19:56.417 --> 19:58.834
Like the big one?

19:58.834 --> 20:03.834
God damn it.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.959
Want to start getting that line
off there and ready to go?

20:05.959 --> 20:07.125
Yes.

20:07.125 --> 20:09.459
[yawns]
I'm hungry.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.584
-Is that ready?
-Yep.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.792
Thank you guys.

20:11.792 --> 20:13.334
All right. This
is going to be tough.

20:13.334 --> 20:15.125
Going to need three or four
wraps on there, okay?

20:15.125 --> 20:16.125
Okay.

20:16.125 --> 20:17.375
Oh, wow.

20:17.375 --> 20:18.709
-I'm going all in on this.
-Yes.

20:18.709 --> 20:20.375
-Windier than it was last time.
-Very.

20:20.375 --> 20:22.000
Point of no return.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.209
The bow is the lightest
part of the boat.

20:24.209 --> 20:26.083
Stern is clear to swing.

20:26.083 --> 20:29.125
The wind has a
tendency to catch the bow

20:29.125 --> 20:30.792
and blow it off the dock.

20:30.792 --> 20:31.918
He's going to get
blown off here.

20:31.918 --> 20:33.209
He's going to come around hard.

20:33.209 --> 20:34.959
It's extremely
important when they make

20:34.959 --> 20:36.751
their throw
with their heaving lines,

20:36.751 --> 20:38.751
get the line hauled in
as quick as they can.

20:38.751 --> 20:39.959
If you don't have your A game,

20:39.959 --> 20:41.959
don't even
show up to the ballpark.

20:41.959 --> 20:45.000
Yeah, when you're ready,
Ben, let her rip.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.542
First line ashore, cap.

20:48.542 --> 20:51.167
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.792
-Pull it in, y'all.
-Secure that stern line.

20:53.792 --> 20:56.751
I'm going to try
and get the bow in.

20:56.751 --> 20:57.918
-[bleep]
-Wrong line.

20:57.918 --> 20:59.584
It's on the wrong ----ing kleat.

20:59.584 --> 21:00.584
-This line.
-Yours is?

21:00.584 --> 21:01.584
Yours.

21:01.584 --> 21:03.292
This is a sh-- sandwich.

21:03.292 --> 21:04.834
What's a sh-- sandwich?

21:04.834 --> 21:06.626
Where you get sandwiched
with sh--.

21:06.626 --> 21:07.876
We're going
to lose this one quickly.

21:07.876 --> 21:09.000
It's on the wrong cleat.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.417
Can it go
to number five, please?

21:10.417 --> 21:11.792
Katie, can
you slacken that for me?

21:11.792 --> 21:12.876
-Yes.
-Tight, tight.

21:12.876 --> 21:14.417
Watching your fenders, Camille.

21:14.417 --> 21:16.876
-Yeah. Keep going.
-All right, start to come in.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.375
Take it up,
take it up, take it up.

21:18.375 --> 21:19.584
Come up on yours.

21:19.584 --> 21:21.167
Take it up, take it up.

21:21.167 --> 21:22.375
Take it up, take it up.

21:22.375 --> 21:24.584
Let's go. Hustle,

21:24.584 --> 21:28.375
Get the God damn slack up
on the bowline, please.

21:28.375 --> 21:30.000
Oh, my God, dude.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.042
Put me up there, Coach.

21:31.042 --> 21:32.375
How's that cap?

21:32.375 --> 21:33.584
I can live with it.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.459
-Lock it in.
-Copy. Locking in.

21:35.459 --> 21:36.792
We made it.
We're here.

21:36.792 --> 21:38.584
Cheers.

21:38.584 --> 21:40.042
You're going to lose it.

21:40.042 --> 21:42.334
-Hold it. Hold it.
-You're going to lose that.

21:42.334 --> 21:43.834
Come on, y'all.

21:43.834 --> 21:46.083
-Hold it. Hold it.
-You're going to lose it.

21:46.083 --> 21:47.167
Ow, [bleep]

21:47.167 --> 21:47.167
Son of a bitch.

21:47.167 --> 21:55.792
He was like,
that bitch has a whip.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.709
What is the God damn problem?

21:57.709 --> 22:00.000
-Hold it, hold it.
-Ow, [bleep].

22:00.000 --> 22:01.125
[bleep]

22:01.125 --> 22:02.459
That first line is critical.

22:02.459 --> 22:04.292
The only thing
that would cause it to pop off

22:04.292 --> 22:07.209
is if it wasn't put on
properly in the first place.

22:07.209 --> 22:11.125
Why did we lose what
we had on the bowline again?

22:11.125 --> 22:12.959
I can only get
it there and hold it there

22:12.959 --> 22:15.834
so long before the wind
is going to win out.

22:15.834 --> 22:18.125
Okay. Do you need
to come quick?

22:18.125 --> 22:18.959
Up, up, up.

22:18.959 --> 22:20.292
-Camille.
-Yes, sir.

22:20.292 --> 22:21.792
Would you mind going
up forward, please?

22:21.792 --> 22:22.834
-Yes.
-Thank you.

22:22.834 --> 22:24.792
Lock it in quick and hard.

22:24.792 --> 22:26.459
Get it right.

22:26.459 --> 22:29.542
All the slack out of it
and lock it in right now.

22:29.542 --> 22:30.584
Pull up, pull up, pull up.

22:30.584 --> 22:32.584
Yeah, Tony, come on.

22:32.584 --> 22:33.751
Keep coming.
Pull up.

22:33.751 --> 22:34.751
Is it locked in?

22:34.751 --> 22:35.876
Let's go, let's go.

22:35.876 --> 22:38.709
-Yeah, cap.
-Copy that.

22:38.709 --> 22:42.250
It wasn't real pretty, but
it sure as hell was effective.

22:42.250 --> 22:46.584
I'm going back.

22:46.584 --> 22:48.501
Jesus Christ.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.959
Everyone has your stuff.
You got a roadie. Let's do it.

22:50.959 --> 22:54.167
Deck crew, can we get
switched into our whites?

22:54.167 --> 22:55.918
Oh, dear.

22:55.918 --> 22:57.209
Did you get it from there?

22:57.209 --> 22:59.834
No, man.

22:59.834 --> 23:00.876
Please. If you don't mind.

23:00.876 --> 23:01.959
Oh, I smell amazing now.

23:01.959 --> 23:04.042
Is this bromance? I think it is.

23:04.042 --> 23:04.751
[knocking]

23:04.751 --> 23:07.209
Come in.
Ross, how are you?

23:07.209 --> 23:08.417
Busy day.

23:08.417 --> 23:10.125
-This good?
-Indeed.

23:10.125 --> 23:12.792
-How are you doing?
-I'm doing okay.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.167
Okay, good.

23:14.167 --> 23:19.626
I'm applying some heat
to the designated area.

23:19.626 --> 23:20.959
Yeah.

23:20.959 --> 23:23.125
I can tell
he's in a lot of pain.

23:23.125 --> 23:25.250
But I got a lot of
respect for Captain.

23:25.250 --> 23:28.334
If he tells me he's
good to go, I believe that.

23:28.334 --> 23:30.667
And until he tells me
he's not,

23:30.667 --> 23:32.209
then we just get
on with the job.

23:32.209 --> 23:35.959
I keep waiting for a break
somewhere and it just...

23:35.959 --> 23:38.584
-it just hasn't happened yet.
-Yeah.

23:38.584 --> 23:44.959
Don't leave me.
I got to hurry up.

23:44.959 --> 23:47.250
All crew
assemble on the aft deck.

23:47.250 --> 23:50.209
There she is.

23:50.209 --> 23:51.792
Bye, thank you so much.

23:51.792 --> 23:52.834
Thank you for coming.

23:52.834 --> 23:53.959
Oh my gosh.

23:53.959 --> 23:55.626
Thank you, Chef Rachel.

23:55.626 --> 23:56.792
I can't...

23:56.792 --> 23:59.876
This was the trip of a lifetime.

23:59.876 --> 24:02.584
After the two years that
we have had, I honestly...

24:02.584 --> 24:06.584
Aw...

24:06.584 --> 24:07.792
It was everything.

24:07.792 --> 24:09.375
The pleasure's ours.

24:09.375 --> 24:11.876
Absolutely.
We can't thank you enough.

24:11.876 --> 24:14.459
It was like
the best, best service.

24:14.459 --> 24:17.792
There was not one negative
thing this entire time.

24:17.792 --> 24:20.292
-Not one.
-Well, you earned it.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.584
Thank you.
I love you all.

24:21.584 --> 24:23.792
Can I offer a tip?

24:23.792 --> 24:27.292
-Absolutely.
-In pink.

24:27.292 --> 24:28.709
All right.

24:28.709 --> 24:30.417
You got to drop that
low, Cap.

24:30.417 --> 24:35.459
Hey!

24:35.459 --> 24:36.876
-Bye.
-Bye.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.959
All right,
that was a great charter.

24:38.959 --> 24:40.792
Wish we could keep them,
but we can't,

24:40.792 --> 24:43.042
so get your asses to work.
Thanks, guys.

24:43.042 --> 24:44.584
-Thank you.
-Thanks, cap.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.792
Getting out of these whites,

24:45.792 --> 24:48.083
turning it into
a blue situation?

24:48.083 --> 24:50.167
-Yes.
-Oh, my God. I'm stuck.

24:50.167 --> 24:51.083
[bleep] me.

24:51.083 --> 24:53.501
Let's get this party started.

24:53.501 --> 24:55.334
I know I'm fun to
watch from back there,

24:55.334 --> 24:57.459
but don't get too
excited, all right?

24:57.459 --> 24:59.626
Let's get some covers on.

24:59.626 --> 25:01.626
-Top to bottom,
-Okay?

25:01.626 --> 25:03.501
-This pot is me.
-It is, isn't it?

25:03.501 --> 25:06.375
Completely empty,
totally useless.

25:06.375 --> 25:09.250
I think I'm smart,
and then it comes to snapping

25:09.250 --> 25:12.959
these effing things
and I feel like a dumbass.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.751
People are smart in
different ways.

25:14.751 --> 25:16.209
Phew.

25:16.209 --> 25:18.125
Attention all crew,
I need everyone's presence

25:18.125 --> 25:20.792
in the sky lounge.
Two minutes.

25:20.792 --> 25:21.959
Should I carry you
up the stairs?

25:21.959 --> 25:23.792
No, you need all that energy.

25:23.792 --> 25:28.792
-For what?
-Tonight?

25:28.792 --> 25:29.959
That'd be cute.

25:29.959 --> 25:31.292
Of course I flirt with Ross.

25:31.292 --> 25:33.876
I just like getting
to know my co-workers.

25:33.876 --> 25:40.167
As he hobbles out.

25:40.167 --> 25:43.918
With his charter,
I see progress being made,

25:43.918 --> 25:45.292
and I appreciate that.

25:45.292 --> 25:47.375
So 23 large.

25:47.375 --> 25:48.751
-Yay!
-Yes!

25:48.751 --> 25:52.792
$1,769 each,

25:52.792 --> 25:54.501
and you certainly have
earned it.

25:54.501 --> 25:58.167
100%, we deserve this tip.
We're working our asses off.

25:58.167 --> 26:00.959
Oh, look, there's enough
sweaty rash. Where's it now?

26:00.959 --> 26:02.501
[laughing]

26:02.501 --> 26:03.959
Oh, God.

26:03.959 --> 26:06.334
Because I'm not getting
around like I should,

26:06.334 --> 26:09.375
is anybody noticing anything
they'd like to bring up?

26:09.375 --> 26:10.667
Because I'm all ears.

26:10.667 --> 26:11.876
Personally,
I'm trying to figure out

26:11.876 --> 26:13.959
my deck-stew position.

26:13.959 --> 26:16.042
-Okay.
-I go everywhere.

26:16.042 --> 26:17.250
That's not going
to change much.

26:17.250 --> 26:18.834
Right, well, yeah.

26:18.834 --> 26:21.000
How that's communicated
to you needs to improve.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.959
I definitely think
we'll have a chat, us three.

26:22.959 --> 26:24.584
So bust your ass till 5:30.

26:24.584 --> 26:27.792
Relax, have a little fun,
and enjoy yourselves.

26:27.792 --> 26:28.959
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

26:28.959 --> 26:30.125
Thank you, Captain.

26:30.125 --> 26:31.959
Camille and Ross,
can we meet now?

26:31.959 --> 26:32.792
Yes.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.375
If I thought
I was angry before,

26:35.375 --> 26:39.667
now I really know
what anger feels like.

26:39.667 --> 26:42.959
Okay, so can
we please all chat first

26:42.959 --> 26:44.083
before we involve Captain?

26:44.083 --> 26:45.542
Yeah, I'm sorry for that.

26:45.542 --> 26:47.167
I really
didn't mean for it to be...

26:47.167 --> 26:49.501
It's fine, it's fine.
Ross and I want nothing more

26:49.501 --> 26:51.626
than for the season to
be successful for everyone.

26:51.626 --> 26:54.417
I've always done it all
on any boat I've ever been on.

26:54.417 --> 26:56.834
There are two bosses.
That's the difference.

26:56.834 --> 26:58.959
If you're unsure any point about

26:58.959 --> 27:00.334
whether you're meant
to be there or something,

27:00.334 --> 27:03.501
like, say to me, hey, do
you still need me now?

27:03.501 --> 27:06.083
Or can I go inside or whatever?

27:06.083 --> 27:07.709
Yeah, I feel really
good about that.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.334
Just the communication thing.

27:10.334 --> 27:12.417
Communication is always
the key in the end, isn't it?

27:12.417 --> 27:14.042
Yeah.

27:14.042 --> 27:17.959
Having Camille on deck is like
having an attractive Labrador.

27:17.959 --> 27:19.667
Great for morale.

27:19.667 --> 27:21.667
Not particularly useful to me.

27:21.667 --> 27:23.083
That was great, though.

27:23.083 --> 27:24.751
I really appreciate us
coming to all that sh--.

27:24.751 --> 27:28.876
Yes.

27:28.876 --> 27:31.209
Bye, ladies.
Thank you for the tip.

27:31.209 --> 27:37.375
His name is Ben.
He's a womanizer.

27:37.375 --> 27:39.459
Oh, my good God.

27:39.459 --> 27:41.334
[belches]
Ugh.

27:41.334 --> 27:43.250
That all washed and rinse.

27:43.250 --> 27:45.125
Yes.

27:45.125 --> 27:47.959
Hey, Cap.
Captain Lee here.

27:47.959 --> 27:50.834
I seem to have found myself
in a wee bit of a bind.

27:50.834 --> 27:52.584
Interior...

27:52.584 --> 27:54.959
-We're done for the night.
-All right, let's go.

27:54.959 --> 27:57.876
Captain, would it be okay to
come and see you at some point?

27:57.876 --> 27:59.876
Absolutely.
Come on up to the bridge.

27:59.876 --> 28:01.250
This is looking good.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.959
All right, I think we're good.

28:02.959 --> 28:04.250
So what little piece
of sh-- sandwich

28:04.250 --> 28:06.250
do you have for me
today, Ross?

28:06.250 --> 28:07.667
-It's something good.
-Oh.

28:07.667 --> 28:09.375
Ben, he's had a
bit of experience

28:09.375 --> 28:10.959
on a few
other larger yachts,

28:10.959 --> 28:14.626
and it might make sense to
give him a bit more of a title.

28:14.626 --> 28:15.876
Uh-huh.

28:15.876 --> 28:17.375
I don't know
how you feel about that.

28:17.375 --> 28:19.167
If you'd like to
make him lead deckhand,

28:19.167 --> 28:20.834
I don't have an issue with it.

28:20.834 --> 28:25.334
That's good.
I shall do that.

28:25.334 --> 28:26.918
-Hi, babe.
-Babe.

28:26.918 --> 28:28.584
Where's my ----ing shoes?

28:28.584 --> 28:31.000
Everyone looking so,
like, fancy.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.209
I show up with my boy shirts,
like, yo!

28:36.209 --> 28:38.125
I'm literally getting
so ----ed up tonight,

28:38.125 --> 28:39.542
it's not even going to be funny.

28:39.542 --> 28:44.292
Well, it's going
to be pretty funny, but...

28:44.292 --> 28:46.792
-A dewy look.
-I think it's sweat.

28:46.792 --> 28:53.584
Stepping out on the town.

28:53.584 --> 28:54.709
Where is Ross?

28:54.709 --> 28:57.667
Ross should be here.

28:57.667 --> 28:59.667
[shouting]

28:59.667 --> 29:01.375
Stop.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.792
[chattering]

29:03.792 --> 29:05.876
Do you know what, Fraser?

29:05.876 --> 29:07.167
Do you mind not
slapping my sunglasses

29:07.167 --> 29:09.626
out of my hand,
next time, please?

29:09.626 --> 29:10.626
Oh, this is so great!

29:10.626 --> 29:11.792
This is so cool!

29:11.792 --> 29:13.751
Let's go.

29:13.751 --> 29:14.751
Thanks, driver.

29:14.751 --> 29:16.501
This is so beautiful!

29:16.501 --> 29:20.250
This is pretty cool.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.501
Here we go.

29:21.501 --> 29:22.584
Are you going to the bar?

29:22.584 --> 29:23.667
-Yeah.
-Going to the bar?

29:23.667 --> 29:24.959
What are you
gonna have?

29:24.959 --> 29:29.292
-I don't know.
-Espresso martini.

29:29.292 --> 29:30.959
Just asking Katie
is she likes Ross.

29:30.959 --> 29:34.292
Like, like like him?

29:34.292 --> 29:36.417
Ooh, got two on one.

29:36.417 --> 29:40.876
A situation like this,
whoever he vibes with...

29:40.876 --> 29:42.542
is the answer.

29:42.542 --> 29:45.959
And I'm going to have
the lobster, please.

29:45.959 --> 29:47.626
Angus chargrilled rib eye.

29:47.626 --> 29:48.792
[chatters]

29:48.792 --> 29:50.792
Give me your kitchen special.

29:50.792 --> 29:51.876
Can you borrow
me a cigarette?

29:51.876 --> 29:54.125
Peace out, girl scout.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.083
-Had a fun charter, ho.
-You and I had a ----ing blast.

29:56.083 --> 29:57.792
Just ----ing laughed
the whole time.

29:57.792 --> 30:00.250
-I love that.
-How nice is this?

30:00.250 --> 30:02.584
I don't like how we're
getting Alissa into smoking.

30:02.584 --> 30:06.584
What are you
looking for over there?

30:06.584 --> 30:10.000
What do you think about that?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.459
I mean, he's a nice guy, yeah.

30:11.459 --> 30:15.292
But I'm not gonna like
be awkward about it.

30:15.292 --> 30:18.334
I'm not that forceful.
If it happens, it happens.

30:18.334 --> 30:19.375
She is.

30:19.375 --> 30:23.792
My nipples just got hard.

30:23.792 --> 30:24.792
Coming up...

30:24.792 --> 30:27.000
It's been hard.

30:27.000 --> 30:27.000
And I've let you guys
down and for that I apologize.

30:27.000 --> 30:38.209
What is the God damn problem?

30:38.209 --> 30:41.667
-Oh, wow. Thank you very much.
-Thank you so much.

30:41.667 --> 30:46.334
Look at you there with
your lobster, Lord Fraser.

30:46.334 --> 30:50.209
I've just got peasant fish.

30:50.209 --> 30:52.918
Bon apetit.

30:52.918 --> 30:54.042
-What's that, fish?
-Yeah.

30:54.042 --> 30:55.792
-Can I try a little bit?
-Yeah.

30:55.792 --> 31:01.375
-I think you have to feed me.
-I'm not f-ing feeding you.

31:01.375 --> 31:05.501
Fraser?

31:05.501 --> 31:15.751
Yeah, we're just going
to have a little chat.

31:15.751 --> 31:20.542
Thank you.

31:20.542 --> 31:23.542
I'm definitely
feeling a little bit tingly

31:23.542 --> 31:24.667
in certain areas,

31:24.667 --> 31:26.000
but I'm just horny, really.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.667
So, yeah, I like
him like that.

31:30.667 --> 31:35.042
Okay. So they're literally
shagging behind us.

31:35.042 --> 31:37.584
I just realized
that come 08:00,

31:37.584 --> 31:39.209
-radio calls start coming.
-Oh, God.

31:39.209 --> 31:41.083
Imagine if you're not up
and Captain calls us

31:41.083 --> 31:42.667
for a coffee
and we're like in bed.

31:42.667 --> 31:45.042
I don't think he's going
to call us before eight.

31:45.042 --> 31:47.918
You know, he's not
in tip-top condition.

31:47.918 --> 31:49.501
You know, I worry. I don't
know if he's going to make

31:49.501 --> 31:50.876
to the end of the season.

31:50.876 --> 31:54.542
-He's a strong man.
-I know he is mentally,

31:54.542 --> 31:56.918
but that can only really
keep him in one place

31:56.918 --> 31:58.375
and that's his cabin
and the bridge

31:58.375 --> 32:01.918
and he needs to be everywhere.

32:01.918 --> 32:04.042
-I do worry.
-Are we going?

32:04.042 --> 32:06.209
I'm ready for the club.
We're shaking our ass.

32:06.209 --> 32:07.959
-Let's go.
-Oh, my God.

32:07.959 --> 32:09.626
I'm gonna be
rotten tomorrow morning.

32:09.626 --> 32:11.626
Ben, we're going to [bleep]
it up in the back.

32:11.626 --> 32:15.000
Guys, I'm so happy it's
just you here because there

32:15.000 --> 32:16.501
is so much
love going on in that.

32:16.501 --> 32:22.375
Oh, my God.
Make out with me right now.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.375
I picked the wrong
----ing car.

32:24.375 --> 32:25.459
Thanks a lot.

32:25.459 --> 32:28.375
-Oh, we're here.
-Oh, my God, I'm so excited.

32:28.375 --> 32:56.876
-There we go.
-Come on, honeys.

32:56.876 --> 33:04.292
Oh, yeah.

33:04.292 --> 33:07.209
Oh, sh--!

33:07.209 --> 33:09.042
I've done a bit of
dancing before back home.

33:09.042 --> 33:11.083
I used to go twice
a week to dance classes.

33:11.083 --> 33:12.375
I've always wanted to be in

33:12.375 --> 33:13.792
Thunder Down Under
from Australia.

33:13.792 --> 33:15.042
I don't know why.

33:15.042 --> 33:16.083
I think I just love
to bust a move

33:16.083 --> 33:33.834
and it's just ----ing fun, man.

33:33.834 --> 33:36.375
Yeah!

33:36.375 --> 33:37.751
Yes, brother!

33:37.751 --> 33:50.626
Whoa!

33:50.626 --> 33:52.250
Hanging out.

33:52.250 --> 33:54.542
Alissa, she's going to do
what she wants to do

33:54.542 --> 33:57.042
and she doesn't really care
who gets in her way and

33:57.042 --> 33:58.876
I like him,
but I can't be like,

33:58.876 --> 34:00.959
oh, yeah, he's mine,
just because he kissed me.

34:00.959 --> 34:03.709
Don't ----ing touch him
because he isn't mine.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.584
But like, it's a respect thing.

34:05.584 --> 34:06.959
Let's go.
It's time to go.

34:06.959 --> 34:08.334
Come on, Ben.

34:08.334 --> 34:09.834
Are you going
to be my Prince charming?

34:09.834 --> 34:11.000
Oi, oi oi.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
I'm in the back.
I'm in the back.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.375
We're with Rachel.

34:14.375 --> 34:16.042
You got to go in
that one, buddy, sorry.

34:16.042 --> 34:21.209
That's the shagmobile.

34:21.209 --> 34:23.501
Don't touch me with your
damn feet, man.

34:23.501 --> 34:24.417
Eww...

34:24.417 --> 34:26.125
-When we get back to the boat...
-Jacuzzi.

34:26.125 --> 34:28.417
Oh my God, my vagina's
fallen off.

34:28.417 --> 34:31.959
[chattering]

34:31.959 --> 34:33.667
Ooh, [bleep].

34:33.667 --> 34:35.167
There's some steps.

34:35.167 --> 34:36.375
Hang on, I'm stuck!

34:36.375 --> 34:38.834
What are we
changing into?

34:38.834 --> 34:41.375
So you and him are full on?
No.

34:41.375 --> 34:43.209
I feel like you found
him attractive before I did.

34:43.209 --> 34:45.167
You know what I mean?
But I want you to know

34:45.167 --> 34:49.584
that he did say,
I am not like

34:49.584 --> 34:55.584
-anything with anybody.
-Shh...

34:55.584 --> 34:57.542
That'd be cute.

34:57.542 --> 34:59.709
-Hey.
-Whoa. I'm changing.

34:59.709 --> 35:00.876
Yeah, you are.

35:00.876 --> 35:02.167
Yeah, my bra's, like... open.

35:02.167 --> 35:05.334
I haven't even
seen these cabins.

35:05.334 --> 35:06.959
Very small.

35:06.959 --> 35:08.334
Good night, bro.

35:08.334 --> 35:13.959
I would not waste
opportunity to sleep.

35:13.959 --> 35:16.042
Warm.

35:16.042 --> 35:17.959
Fraser, I don't want
to see your special bits.

35:17.959 --> 35:19.751
I'm going to go to the corner.

35:19.751 --> 35:22.375
I don't want to see anything.
I'll never be the same again.

35:22.375 --> 35:26.417
Woo!

35:26.417 --> 35:28.417
I'm so afraid to turn around,
but also

35:28.417 --> 35:30.792
I'm afraid to back up
at the same time.

35:30.792 --> 35:39.709
Is it safe?

35:39.709 --> 35:55.584
No sex here.

35:55.584 --> 36:02.250
Katie...

36:02.250 --> 36:16.417
Ross!

36:16.417 --> 36:19.918
Why?

36:19.918 --> 36:41.792
Zero.

36:41.792 --> 36:43.542
Right, I'm going to bed.

36:43.542 --> 36:45.167
This is ridiculous.

36:45.167 --> 37:05.250
Bed, bed, bed, bed, bed
for me.

37:05.250 --> 37:08.792
Doing my job, for God's sake.

37:08.792 --> 37:10.959
What are you doing?

37:10.959 --> 37:18.167
I brought everything down.

37:18.167 --> 37:20.375
What? I said he can
get himself a beer.

37:20.375 --> 37:23.250
No, someone was just
kissing Alissa.

37:23.250 --> 37:23.250
Oh.

37:23.250 --> 37:41.626
-Oh, wow. Thank you very much.
-Thank you so much.

37:41.626 --> 37:43.584
...you naughty lovebug.

37:43.584 --> 38:04.083
What? I said he can
get himself a beer.

38:04.083 --> 38:06.459
look, I am a free agent.

38:06.459 --> 38:08.792
I can kiss who I want,
blady-blah.

38:08.792 --> 38:13.792
-Ben?
-Yeah?

38:13.792 --> 38:17.292
The sooner Katie knows
you're interested, the better.

38:17.292 --> 38:19.250
No, seriously,
that's super ----ed up

38:19.250 --> 38:20.959
and I'm not going
to ----ing roll with that.

38:20.959 --> 38:22.876
Don't ----ing play like you're
going to flirt with me

38:22.876 --> 38:24.459
and then go out and flirt with

38:24.459 --> 38:25.459
somebody else
right in front of me.

38:25.459 --> 38:26.918
It makes me look dumb.

38:26.918 --> 38:32.042
If you want to act
like that, then [bleep] you.

38:32.042 --> 38:33.792
Goodnight.

38:33.792 --> 38:35.083
[sobbing]

38:35.083 --> 38:38.918
All right, I'm going
to go to bed.

38:38.918 --> 38:42.167
Okay.

38:42.167 --> 38:46.334
You were a minute.

38:46.334 --> 38:59.959
She got upset because
she's got too many feelings.

38:59.959 --> 39:01.542
-Hello.
-Hi.

39:01.542 --> 39:03.626
Can I join this situation?

39:03.626 --> 39:05.584
-Cheers.
-You're on my sh---list.

39:05.584 --> 39:08.626
Ross, I didn't know
you were such a ----ing player.

39:08.626 --> 39:10.667
Look at him.
He's just ----ing smiling.

39:10.667 --> 39:12.459
That's all,
get out of here.

39:12.459 --> 39:15.459
I don't like what your vibe
is towards my gal pal.

39:15.459 --> 39:18.125
You guys don't
even ----ing know me.

39:18.125 --> 39:19.167
-On that note...
-Goodbye.

39:19.167 --> 39:20.459
Bye.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.167
I'll see you
tomorrow in the morning.

39:22.167 --> 39:25.000
If I had to explain
what Ross is,

39:25.000 --> 39:28.792
I would look up all
the synonyms for manhore.

39:28.792 --> 39:33.125
Whoremonger, manho,
playboy, cad, [bleep] boy.

39:33.125 --> 39:34.375
Himbo.

39:34.375 --> 39:36.792
It's like a bimbo,
but for a him.

39:36.792 --> 39:39.375
He's a himbo.
I just want Ben right now.

39:39.375 --> 39:45.083
I'm going to get really
----ed up before I do that.

39:45.083 --> 39:56.209
Oh my gosh.

39:56.209 --> 40:05.167
[alarm blares]

40:05.167 --> 40:06.584
Morning my baby love.

40:06.584 --> 40:08.918
Why did we get that
----ed up last night?

40:08.918 --> 40:11.918
-I feel great.
-Oh.

40:11.918 --> 40:21.584
Oh my God.

40:21.584 --> 40:22.751
Right?

40:22.751 --> 40:24.167
I was thinking to myself,

40:24.167 --> 40:26.250
this is
the longest that I haven't

40:26.250 --> 40:28.542
had sex in
I don't remember when.

40:28.542 --> 40:30.167
-That's a lie.
-I'm not joking.

40:30.167 --> 40:31.375
It has to be a lie.

40:31.375 --> 40:32.626
Do you want to know
something funny?

40:32.626 --> 40:34.125
-What?
-I've not had sex, right.

40:34.125 --> 40:38.209
In about two years?

40:38.209 --> 40:40.626
-and I can't [bleep] anyone?
-Yeah.

40:40.626 --> 40:49.000
And also,
I have such high standards.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.959
Two years ago, I was part of
a polyamorous group in Bali.

40:52.959 --> 40:56.292
We have massive Villa parties,
just partying, and someone goes,

40:56.292 --> 40:57.292
"Hey, you want to [bleep]
and you go [bleep],

40:57.292 --> 40:58.918
you come back to the party.

40:58.918 --> 41:07.125
Someone else goes, you want
to [bleep], you go [bleep].

41:07.125 --> 41:08.876
Somewhere around there.

41:08.876 --> 41:11.709
I'm not a big fan of dry spells,
so it's a very real problem.

41:11.709 --> 41:25.000
However, there are solutions
and I'll probably use them.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.667
Interesting you know?
And concerning.

41:27.667 --> 41:31.459
But equally, this information
wasn't welcome or needed.

41:31.459 --> 41:34.209
But I guess
I see more of who he is

41:34.209 --> 41:36.751
and where his drive lies.

41:36.751 --> 41:47.083
And it ain't here.

41:47.083 --> 41:48.584
That's really bad.

41:48.584 --> 41:50.334
All right, good luck in life.

41:50.334 --> 41:51.959
-I'm feeling good.
-Good.

41:51.959 --> 41:52.959
I danced it all out, I think.

41:52.959 --> 42:01.959
[laughing]

42:01.959 --> 42:05.918
Oh my God.

42:05.918 --> 42:07.209
Attention all crew,

42:07.209 --> 42:09.584
I need everyone in
the Sky Lounge in ten.

42:09.584 --> 42:12.209
-Galley copies.
-Copy from Fraser.

42:12.209 --> 42:14.000
Coming up, Katie?

42:14.000 --> 42:18.792
-Yeah.
-I love my ass hanging out.

42:18.792 --> 42:21.000
Finally.

42:21.000 --> 42:32.751
I know you all
heard me coming, right?

42:32.751 --> 42:39.000
As you guys know, I've been
struggling with my mobility.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.792
And...

42:42.792 --> 42:47.083
It's been hard,
and I've let you guys down.

42:47.083 --> 42:51.042
For that, I apologize.

42:51.042 --> 42:53.959
So I've made a decision...

42:53.959 --> 42:55.375
To leave the boat.

42:55.375 --> 42:57.042
-What?
-Oh, captain.

42:57.042 --> 43:01.042
No...
