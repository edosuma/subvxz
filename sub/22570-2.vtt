00:17.067 --> 00:19.233
What's this?
Metal detecting, are you?

00:22.200 --> 00:24.133
- Pardon?
- Metal detecting?

00:26.300 --> 00:28.600
- That's right.
- Found anything?

00:28.633 --> 00:30.633
Er...bits and bobs.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.732
Good luck.
Maybe you'll strike gold.

00:32.767 --> 00:34.700
Yes! See ya.

00:44.433 --> 00:45.433
Hello.

00:47.633 --> 00:49.633
Looking for treasure?

00:49.667 --> 00:52.267
- Something like that.
- What have you found?

00:52.300 --> 00:54.300
- Bits and pieces.
- No gold?

00:54.333 --> 00:57.433
- Nope.
- Fingers crossed.

00:57.467 --> 00:59.400
Yeah. See ya.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.433
- All right?
- This is a problem.

01:05.467 --> 01:08.033
It's a public footpath.
Bloody ramblers coming by

01:08.067 --> 01:09.800
asking the same questions
all the time.

01:09.833 --> 01:11.233
Here come some more.

01:12.633 --> 01:14.533
Ah, metal detectors.

01:14.567 --> 01:17.467
We had a metal detector once,
didn't we, Rosemary?

01:17.500 --> 01:19.133
That's still in the garage.

01:19.167 --> 01:21.500
Is that so?

01:21.533 --> 01:23.600
- Have you found any gold?
- Oh, Jesus.

01:23.633 --> 01:25.200
- Pardon?
- No, no. No gold.

01:25.233 --> 01:26.400
No, no. No, no.

01:26.433 --> 01:29.600
- Fingers crossed.
- Yeah.

01:29.633 --> 01:33.633
Er...tell me, how many more
of you are coming through?

01:33.667 --> 01:36.633
Of us? About 50 today, I think.

01:43.733 --> 01:45.667
- Call it a day?
- Probably best.

01:57.133 --> 02:01.733
* Will you search through
the lonely earth for me?

02:01.767 --> 02:06.433
* Climb through
the briar and bramble

02:06.467 --> 02:09.467
* I'll be your treasure...

02:09.500 --> 02:11.500
That was a good couple of hours.

02:11.533 --> 02:13.533
You getting good stuff?

02:13.567 --> 02:15.067
Me too.

02:16.167 --> 02:18.300
Bloody ramblers notwithstanding.

02:18.333 --> 02:20.333
All Roman.
Nothing spectacular but...

02:20.367 --> 02:22.833
Five of these bronzes
and that's part of something.

02:22.867 --> 02:25.033
Not sure what.

02:25.067 --> 02:29.033
Same here. Roman grots.
Four or five of 'em.

02:30.467 --> 02:32.233
How many times have
we searched this field

02:32.267 --> 02:35.333
and only now it starts
throwing up its treasure?

02:35.367 --> 02:36.700
In six weeks' time,

02:36.733 --> 02:39.300
this'll be solar panels
as far as the eye can see.

02:40.300 --> 02:41.767
Less than six weeks.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.400
Doesn't exactly make
your heart sing, does it?

02:44.433 --> 02:47.633
Oh, well.
Set biscitus deteriatum.

02:49.167 --> 02:51.433
- See University Challenge?
- Yeah.

02:52.867 --> 02:54.800
What three-letter generic name

02:54.833 --> 02:56.833
is given to the bird family
Paridae?

02:56.867 --> 02:58.833
- Bzzz.
- Balliol, Potts.

02:58.867 --> 03:01.233
- Tit.
- Tit is correct! Yes!

03:03.100 --> 03:05.100
Classic.

03:05.133 --> 03:07.133
Hello, there!

03:07.167 --> 03:09.000
Ah, speaking of tits.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.333
Heeeello, there.

03:14.367 --> 03:16.267
What are you doing here?

03:16.300 --> 03:18.767
Just er...passing by.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.467
You're always just passing by.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.500
You must come miles
out of your way to pass by.

03:24.067 --> 03:26.067
It must seem like that, yes.

03:26.100 --> 03:30.333
No, er...we haven't seen you
since your amazing find.

03:30.367 --> 03:34.267
Your golden aestel. Wanted to
congratulate you, actually.

03:34.300 --> 03:35.667
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.700
Really fantastic.

03:37.733 --> 03:39.467
How does it feel?

03:39.500 --> 03:43.300
To have a piece with my name
under it in the British Museum?

03:43.333 --> 03:46.233
Er...it feels good.

03:47.567 --> 03:49.567
I imagine it does.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.433
Well, congratulations.
Here's to you.

03:52.467 --> 03:53.833
Mrs Robinson.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.267
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.467
Is that all you came to say?

03:57.500 --> 04:00.833
That, and to er...

04:00.867 --> 04:04.633
..wave a white flag...
so to speak.

04:04.667 --> 04:08.267
Don't you think it's time we put
our differences behind us?

04:08.300 --> 04:10.067
Maybe pool resources.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.300
What resources?

04:11.333 --> 04:13.267
Well...our permissions.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.533
We've got more than enough land
to detect on.

04:15.567 --> 04:20.666
And this farm here, it's...far
too big for just the two of you.

04:20.700 --> 04:23.300
If you've got more than enough
land, why come here?

04:23.333 --> 04:26.433
- Sometimes it's good...
- I wasn't talking to you, Paul.

04:29.067 --> 04:31.300
More choice.
Different topography.

04:31.333 --> 04:33.733
You don't have any permissions,
do you?

04:33.767 --> 04:36.667
- We do.
- Oh, yeah? Where?

04:36.700 --> 04:40.100
I'm not gonna tell you, am I?
Unless you agree to share.

04:40.133 --> 04:42.067
Oh, right.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.600
We have some prime locations.

04:46.633 --> 04:48.567
Oh, do you?

04:52.067 --> 04:53.567
I know what you're doing.

04:54.533 --> 04:55.800
What am I doing?

04:55.833 --> 04:58.233
- A Jimmy Waffle-on.
- No, I'm not.

04:58.267 --> 05:00.367
I've just got an itchy chin,
that's all.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.467
I've got a bit of an itchy chin,
as well.

05:02.500 --> 05:06.233
- Tell us about the permissions.
- And now you're both doing it.

05:06.267 --> 05:09.233
You're both doing
a Jimmy Waffle-on.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.267
Aren't they? Chinny reckon?

05:11.300 --> 05:12.367
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

05:12.400 --> 05:16.733
- No, we're not.
- We've got itchy chins is all.

05:16.767 --> 05:18.767
Really?

05:18.800 --> 05:20.800
Pathetic.

05:20.833 --> 05:22.767
Come on, Paul.

05:30.467 --> 05:31.767
Spanners.

05:53.733 --> 05:55.667
Kate? Are you here?

05:58.133 --> 06:00.100
Kate, can I have a word?

06:00.133 --> 06:02.067
Just a minute.

06:06.633 --> 06:09.367
Hello, Dad. Sorry,
I'm running late again.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.667
- Kate, we need to have a chat.
- Can we take this poster down?

06:13.833 --> 06:15.833
The tennis lady? Why?

06:15.867 --> 06:17.433
Don't you think it's tacky?

06:17.467 --> 06:19.300
Tacky? No.

06:19.333 --> 06:22.533
And a bit... Well...
degrading to women.

06:22.567 --> 06:25.067
Kate, she's scratching
her bottom.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.367
Dad, she's got no knickers on.

06:28.467 --> 06:30.333
Hasn't she?

06:30.367 --> 06:32.300
I'm late.
I'll talk to you later.

06:34.567 --> 06:37.600
- Oh, Dad?
- Hm?

06:37.633 --> 06:40.567
I think there's a squirrel
in the flat.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.533
See ya.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.600
Heurrggh!

07:05.800 --> 07:07.167
Yargh!

07:10.700 --> 07:12.033
Oyoh!

07:28.600 --> 07:29.800
Yargh!

07:33.100 --> 07:35.033
Ahhh!

07:38.133 --> 07:40.067
Argh! Argh!

07:41.433 --> 07:42.533
Oohhhh!

07:42.567 --> 07:46.167
Oh, bloody hell!
Oh, bloody, bloody hell!

07:46.200 --> 07:48.200
It was terrible.

07:48.233 --> 07:50.233
I was going from room to room

07:50.267 --> 07:53.033
with a saucepan
and a mop handle,

07:53.067 --> 07:55.667
poking under the furniture,
shaking curtains.

07:55.700 --> 07:58.367
It took me an hour and a half
to search the flat.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.467
- And no squirrel?
- Didn't find one.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.433
She was winding you up.

08:04.100 --> 08:06.633
- Think she was winding me up?
- Sounds like a wind-up.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.633
That's what it's like. Chaos.

08:12.667 --> 08:16.100
And she never sticks to a plan
so I never know if she's in.

08:16.133 --> 08:20.500
Where does that leave us if you
can't stay with me on my boat?

08:20.533 --> 08:23.333
I've been looking into remedies
for sea-sickness.

08:23.367 --> 08:26.533
So have I. I think you
should try hypnotherapy.

08:28.367 --> 08:31.233
I've always tried to steer clear
of the mystical.

08:31.267 --> 08:32.567
It's not mystical.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.600
It is a bit mystical.

08:34.633 --> 08:37.299
I'm not afraid of boats.

08:37.332 --> 08:39.332
It's the movement.

08:39.366 --> 08:41.433
Hypnotists can't stop
the boat from moving.

08:41.467 --> 08:43.732
Maybe you can. In your head.

08:43.767 --> 08:45.800
Let me get you an appointment.

08:48.433 --> 08:50.200
Wow...

08:50.233 --> 08:53.033
Take a brave man
to go poking around in here.

08:54.467 --> 08:57.100
Who knows what
might be unleashed?

09:06.533 --> 09:09.567
I don't understand
what we're doing here.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.800
Tim. There's nothing down here.

09:14.233 --> 09:15.500
Give it another hour.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.067
Tim.

09:20.300 --> 09:23.733
Tim. I think you'd better
come see this.

09:23.767 --> 09:25.700
- Where's this?
- Just over here.

09:39.167 --> 09:40.600
Amazing.

09:41.833 --> 09:43.700
See the flagstones
protecting it?

09:43.733 --> 09:45.400
As if it was preserved
on purpose.

09:45.433 --> 09:47.133
A layer of sand,
then stones on top.

09:47.167 --> 09:48.633
Do we know how far it extends?

09:48.667 --> 09:52.133
At least four foot in that
direction but maybe further.

09:52.167 --> 09:54.800
- Cover it up.
- Huh?

09:54.833 --> 09:56.600
Get a tarp or something.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.467
Cover it up.

10:02.667 --> 10:04.167
Hello.

10:05.733 --> 10:08.133
Hello.

10:08.167 --> 10:10.167
Over here. How are you?

10:10.200 --> 10:12.133
Good to see you.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.733
It's all there, Becks.
It has to be.

10:19.767 --> 10:23.400
I reckon the stones were put
down to protect the mosaic.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.167
I can see you.

10:47.067 --> 10:49.167
I think the whole floor
might be complete.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.700
I took off the edge stone
and the mosaic was right there.

10:51.733 --> 10:53.667
It's so beautiful, look.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.733
- Oh, weird.
- What?

11:01.767 --> 11:04.433
I took at least five photos.
They're not here.

11:04.467 --> 11:07.100
- Are you sure you saved them?
- Balls. Where are they?

11:07.133 --> 11:10.467
Doesn't matter. I'll take some
more when we lift the stones.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.500
- Brilliant. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

11:12.533 --> 11:15.667
And you know what? I saw, at
last, some enthusiasm in Tim.

11:15.700 --> 11:19.033
Usually nothing stirs him.
But he got quite emotional.

11:19.067 --> 11:21.733
Well, good.
Sounds like it's working out.

11:21.767 --> 11:23.500
Yeah. Yeah.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.233
I think it's working out.

11:29.833 --> 11:33.333
He can't make me do anything
against my will?

11:33.367 --> 11:36.667
You're always fully conscious.
Just in a very relaxed state.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.700
So...

11:38.733 --> 11:41.467
He can't make me say anything
I'll regret later?

11:41.500 --> 11:42.600
No.

11:42.633 --> 11:45.400
Ah. Nothing specific.

11:46.467 --> 11:49.333
Not hiding anything...

11:49.367 --> 11:51.367
to my knowledge.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.767
- Just chill.
- I'm just saying.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.733
I don't want to blurt
anything out.

11:57.067 --> 11:59.833
Do people tend to blurt?

11:59.867 --> 12:01.500
There's very little blurting.

12:01.533 --> 12:03.467
Oh, good. Good.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.400
- Mr Stater?
- Yes.

12:07.433 --> 12:08.800
Would you like to come through?

12:08.833 --> 12:10.833
- Why?
- For your treatment.

12:10.867 --> 12:12.233
I'm Dr Hoffmann.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.733
Are you?

12:15.767 --> 12:17.133
Is she?

12:17.167 --> 12:18.767
Yes! That's Dr Hoffmann.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.167
Oh, yeah. Great. Good. Yeah.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.000
Let's go.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.267
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.233
Try to relax.

12:35.367 --> 12:37.300
- I want this to work.
- Me too.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.800
Just take a seat there
and make yourself comfortable.

12:53.833 --> 12:55.467
Oh.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.667
I was expecting, you know...
hangings.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.000
Hangings?

13:03.533 --> 13:05.533
Tie-dyed wall hangings.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.467
Wind chimes.
The smell of patchouli.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.533
Oh, I see. Like a mystic.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.333
You're not gonna have me
doing Elvis, are you?

13:13.367 --> 13:15.733
No, no. Nothing like that.

13:15.767 --> 13:18.667
Cos that's the thing, isn't it?
You know.

13:18.700 --> 13:21.300
Someone says the word
"fish and chips"

13:21.333 --> 13:24.167
and I am compelled
to sing and dance like Elvis.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.667
I suppose so.

13:27.567 --> 13:30.767
- Could you do that?
- I'm not a stage hypnotist.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.033
- Can I call you Lance?
- Please do.

13:33.067 --> 13:37.167
Great. So...the only way
this can work

13:37.200 --> 13:41.400
is if you are completely
comfortable and relaxed.

13:49.767 --> 13:50.767
Thank you.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.600
Sit back...

13:56.633 --> 14:00.733
Success depends on
you being able to...

14:00.767 --> 14:02.267
completely switch off.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.300
Trust my voice.

14:04.333 --> 14:06.333
And let it carry you away.

14:06.367 --> 14:09.600
I suppose it would be difficult
if you had an annoying accent

14:09.633 --> 14:11.067
or a squeaky voice.

14:12.667 --> 14:15.400
Try and put those thoughts
out of your mind for a while.

14:16.433 --> 14:20.033
Try to empty your mind.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.333
I will do exactly as you say!

14:23.367 --> 14:25.833
Well done. Just close your eyes.

14:25.867 --> 14:29.167
And listen to the sound
of my voice.

14:29.200 --> 14:32.167
- Listening.
- No need to tell me that.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.500
Just listen.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.633
- Got it.
- You don't have to say a thing.

14:39.667 --> 14:43.167
Oh. But I thought you were
waiting for a reply.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.467
- No.
- Cos you hesitated.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.667
I might do that but you don't
need to say anything or worry.

14:47.700 --> 14:51.767
Just relax...and listen.

15:07.800 --> 15:14.100
So I want you to imagine that
you are lying on soft, warm sand

15:14.133 --> 15:15.767
on a beach.

15:15.800 --> 15:19.200
And it is a beautiful
summer's day.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.600
And the sun is on your face.

15:21.633 --> 15:24.367
You've not got
a care in the world

15:24.400 --> 15:27.567
or anything to do.

15:27.600 --> 15:31.800
- You can enjoy the sun all day.
- Sorry. Sorry.

15:31.833 --> 15:33.700
Sorry, I um...

15:33.733 --> 15:35.567
I'm very sensitive to the sun.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.100
I burn very easily.

15:38.133 --> 15:41.533
I wouldn't just sunbathe. Um...

15:41.567 --> 15:43.667
Is carpet the same as sand?

15:43.700 --> 15:46.100
Could I lie in my flat?

15:46.133 --> 15:48.300
Yes.

15:48.333 --> 15:51.400
So you are lying
on the carpet...

15:52.500 --> 15:54.500
- ..in your flat.
- Hm.

15:54.533 --> 15:58.700
You are very comfortable
and warm. Just right.

15:58.733 --> 16:02.567
And you can feel yourself
sinking into the carpet.

16:02.600 --> 16:06.433
Sinking down through the carpet,

16:06.467 --> 16:12.133
down, down...and the carpet...

16:12.167 --> 16:13.667
No, no. The problem is...

16:13.700 --> 16:17.400
- You live on the first floor?
- On the first floor. Exactly.

16:17.433 --> 16:20.267
So I'm sinking down now
into Mrs Morris's flat.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.833
She's gonna be terrified.

16:21.867 --> 16:24.433
It works best on a beach,
you can just keep on sinking.

16:24.467 --> 16:28.233
Er...have you got
one of those sunshades?

16:28.267 --> 16:32.000
Maybe I could sit under
one of those big umbrellas.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.400
Yes, do that.

16:35.833 --> 16:38.500
Right, here we go.
Back on the beach.

16:38.533 --> 16:40.467
Carry on.

16:42.333 --> 16:44.167
Carry on-ez-vous.

16:55.433 --> 16:57.433
You were very quick.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.267
I was out like a light, yeah.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.467
- Like that. Spark-o.
- Really?

17:01.500 --> 17:04.567
Yeah. I feel different.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.833
Like I don't suffer from
sea-sickness any more.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.800
Why did she have
her head in her hands?

17:08.833 --> 17:10.833
Did she?

17:10.867 --> 17:13.200
Oh, I think she had
a migraine coming on.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.166
Can children get migraines?

17:16.200 --> 17:17.599
She wasn't that young.

17:17.633 --> 17:19.700
She didn't know
who Yuri Geller was.

17:19.733 --> 17:22.133
Why were you talking about
Yuri Geller?

17:22.166 --> 17:24.567
I was talking about fraudsters
in general.

17:24.599 --> 17:28.067
Not her. I was just saying
there must be some out there.

17:28.099 --> 17:30.100
But, no, yeah.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.067
I think it's done some good.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.467
What's this?

17:36.500 --> 17:38.800
That's for being brave.

17:38.833 --> 17:42.067
Aw, cheers.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.200
Well, better get off
to the scout hut.

17:44.233 --> 17:46.433
Wanna stay tomorrow night,
see if it worked?

17:46.467 --> 17:49.700
- Yeah. Go on, then.
- We can get a takeaway.

17:49.733 --> 17:53.033
- Treat you to fish and chips.
- Thank you very much.

18:01.867 --> 18:03.833
Very nice.

18:03.867 --> 18:08.100
House of Constantine,
circa 224-330AD.

18:08.133 --> 18:11.667
- That's what I said.
- And this one is third century,

18:11.700 --> 18:13.700
possibly Claudius II.

18:13.733 --> 18:16.333
- I said that as well.
- All this from the same field?

18:16.367 --> 18:19.700
There's something good going on
down there, Terry. We're close.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.767
What's Russell doing?
Russell?

18:27.167 --> 18:28.467
Russ!

18:30.067 --> 18:32.333
- What you doing?
- I'm on my new app.

18:32.367 --> 18:35.333
- Your what?
- It's my new app. On my phone.

18:35.367 --> 18:38.167
It's a metal-detecting app.
It's great.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.400
You can go on different
historical sites to detect.

18:41.433 --> 18:43.500
I'm currently on Hadrian's Wall.

18:43.533 --> 18:46.733
Well, now I've seen everything.

18:46.767 --> 18:49.633
Here we go. Good signal, 12.5.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.600
It's deep.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.533
Ahh.

19:06.567 --> 19:08.600
Roman centurion's helmet.

19:08.633 --> 19:10.567
Good condition.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.800
I'm keeping it.

19:20.700 --> 19:23.533
So did Andy tell you
who's been snooping around?

19:23.567 --> 19:26.100
- Who?
- Simon and Garfunkel.

19:26.133 --> 19:27.267
The Antiqui-searchers?

19:27.300 --> 19:30.700
Didn't they change their name
to something ridiculous?

19:30.733 --> 19:33.767
The Dirt Sharks.

19:38.333 --> 19:41.800
Right, well. There you go, then.

19:41.833 --> 19:43.833
It's decided.

19:43.867 --> 19:46.300
We are no longer
the Dirt Sharks.

19:46.333 --> 19:47.767
What are we?

19:47.800 --> 19:49.233
Terra Firma.

19:49.267 --> 19:51.100
Yes!

19:51.133 --> 19:53.767
But we're spelling "terra"
the proper Latin way.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.800
Not the way
you want to spell it.

19:55.833 --> 19:57.833
It's scarier my way.

19:57.867 --> 20:00.467
Right, then.
New name, new start.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.167
This year, I am determined,
will be the year

20:03.200 --> 20:06.300
we are finally accepted
onto a proper organised rally.

20:06.333 --> 20:09.800
And when we are,
I want us to be prepared.

20:09.833 --> 20:14.333
- I wanna see the Dirt Sharks...
- Terra Firma.

20:14.367 --> 20:18.433
I want Terra Firma to get the
best finds in every category.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.700
Gavin,
what are you gonna find?

20:24.433 --> 20:26.433
James I, hammered groat.

20:26.467 --> 20:29.300
- Is it real?
- I think so. I got it on eBay.

20:29.333 --> 20:31.033
How deep will it be?

20:31.067 --> 20:32.367
Four, five inches.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.267
- Reading?
- 53.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.267
- A bit scratchy.
- Nice.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.767
Michael?

20:44.300 --> 20:46.033
Be realistic.

20:46.067 --> 20:49.400
So I said, "If that turns out
to be the case,

20:49.433 --> 20:53.500
I will change my name
by deed poll

20:53.533 --> 20:55.433
to Belinda Carlisle."

21:01.067 --> 21:02.500
What a wonderful story!

21:02.533 --> 21:05.667
True as I'm sitting here now.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.600
That restores your faith
in humanity, doesn't it?

21:10.367 --> 21:12.333
Another cup of tea, Belinda?

21:15.133 --> 21:16.667
There she goes.

21:16.700 --> 21:19.033
You know...

21:19.067 --> 21:21.567
She's got the timing
of Ken Dodd, that one.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.533
I'll give you that one, Sheila!

21:25.467 --> 21:27.133
We have a laugh, don't we?

21:42.300 --> 21:44.467
You idiot!

21:44.500 --> 21:46.500
How could you get it so wrong?

21:46.533 --> 21:49.100
- I just thought...
- What?

21:50.067 --> 21:51.100
It doesn't matter.

21:53.700 --> 21:56.267
Why don't you think
before you open your mouth?

21:56.300 --> 21:57.733
Knobhead.

22:02.267 --> 22:05.533
Well...we've had
a very busy week.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.633
After a typically
infuriating encounter

22:09.667 --> 22:12.567
with those two goons
from the DMDC,

22:12.600 --> 22:16.133
Paul and I decided to drop in
on their landowner.

22:16.167 --> 22:18.233
- See if we couldn't...
- Butter him up.

22:18.267 --> 22:21.500
..curry favour,
I was going to say.

22:24.833 --> 22:26.667
And the information
he gave us was...

22:26.700 --> 22:29.000
- Weapons-grade.
- Can you stop interrupting?

22:31.167 --> 22:33.833
Turns out the church farm
has been acquired by

22:33.867 --> 22:36.033
a solar energy company.

22:36.067 --> 22:39.200
They're due to start converting
the land in five weeks.

22:39.233 --> 22:41.067
So did he give you permission?

22:41.100 --> 22:43.033
He didn't, no.

22:46.400 --> 22:50.000
But Photon Harvest
Solar Electricity did.

22:51.267 --> 22:53.100
Paul's idea.

22:53.133 --> 22:55.233
Cut out the middle man.
Go straight to the top.

22:55.267 --> 22:57.567
Offer them a service
they can't live without.

22:57.600 --> 22:58.733
What service?

22:58.767 --> 23:00.767
Obstruction clearance.

23:00.800 --> 23:03.033
Farm machinery,
unexploded bombs.

23:03.067 --> 23:06.567
- That was my idea.
- I just said it was your idea.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.500
I gave you credit
about two seconds ago.

23:09.533 --> 23:11.467
You don't have to repeat it.

23:13.633 --> 23:16.500
Well, it was when I mentioned
unexploded bombs

23:16.533 --> 23:18.633
and what happened to that idiot
Terry Seymour

23:18.667 --> 23:23.267
a couple of years ago, that
their ears pricked right up.

23:23.300 --> 23:26.333
And the permission...
ladies and gentlemen...

23:27.667 --> 23:28.800
- ..is...
- ..ours.

23:28.833 --> 23:30.433
Oh, God!

23:41.633 --> 23:43.200
Are you the metal detectors?

23:43.233 --> 23:45.800
Are we the metal detectors?

23:45.833 --> 23:47.833
The bloke I spoke to
on the phone.

23:47.867 --> 23:49.633
No.

23:49.667 --> 23:51.800
- Oh, right. We got some.
- Some what?

23:51.833 --> 23:54.600
We got some metal detectors
to do this so we don't need you.

23:55.867 --> 23:57.800
Sorry, wait. What?

23:57.833 --> 24:01.033
We got five weeks
till this farm's converted.

24:01.067 --> 24:03.067
Five weeks
till the panels go up.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.433
We need somebody
to get rid of the obstructions.

24:05.467 --> 24:07.600
And you've got
your own detectorists?

24:07.633 --> 24:10.500
They're freelance. They wrote
to us. We've employed them.

24:10.533 --> 24:13.133
- What are they called?
- A company called...

24:13.167 --> 24:14.267
Terra Firma.

24:14.300 --> 24:17.567
- Never heard of 'em.
- When are they showing up?

24:17.600 --> 24:20.767
Thought they were gonna be here.
I was supposed to meet them.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.167
I thought you were them.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.667
You are kidding me.

24:40.567 --> 24:42.167
Are you the metal detectors?

24:42.200 --> 24:43.600
Indeed we are.

24:43.633 --> 24:46.533
Terra Firma at your service,
sir.

24:46.567 --> 24:48.467
I can see from
our friends' faces

24:48.500 --> 24:52.667
- they've heard the good news.
- Sneaky bloody trick.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.700
Quite the opposite, in fact.

24:54.733 --> 24:57.367
We've been through
all the correct channels,

24:57.400 --> 24:59.800
as can be proved
with this paper trail.

24:59.833 --> 25:02.367
We've been on this farm
five years.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.033
Can't you all do it? I don't
care if they do it as well.

25:05.067 --> 25:07.067
No, no, no, no, no, no.

25:07.100 --> 25:11.233
You gave us the permission
as stated in this email.

25:11.267 --> 25:13.233
We have the permission
of the landowner.

25:13.267 --> 25:15.067
Over-ruled, actually.

25:15.100 --> 25:17.533
Oh, come on. There's only
four of you and 300 acres.

25:17.567 --> 25:19.033
Why can't you work together?

25:19.067 --> 25:22.500
We gave them the chance to share
and they turned it down.

25:22.533 --> 25:24.133
Why should we?
We got here first.

25:24.167 --> 25:26.067
We got here first.
Why should we share it?

25:26.100 --> 25:27.500
- You should share.
- Shut up.

25:27.533 --> 25:30.700
- You shut up.
- It's like a school playground!

25:30.733 --> 25:32.200
How old are you lot?

25:32.233 --> 25:34.567
We'll do it first come,
first served.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.267
Whoever gets here first
gets the choice of their field.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.033
Not fair.

25:39.067 --> 25:41.067
You can all sling your hooks!
I don't care!

25:41.100 --> 25:43.800
Hang on, hang on, wait.
I can go along with that.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.700
First come, first served.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.600
OK.

25:54.633 --> 25:56.467
See? We don't have
to behave like kids.

25:56.500 --> 25:59.633
Yeah, but after
we've chosen the field,

25:59.667 --> 26:03.567
there's an invisible force field
all the way around

26:03.600 --> 26:05.233
and you cannot enter it.

26:05.267 --> 26:07.367
What if we haven't got
our detectors?

26:07.400 --> 26:08.800
It's an impenetrable
force field.

26:08.833 --> 26:11.600
Right. Now shake hands.

26:11.633 --> 26:13.733
- No way.
- Never.

26:14.833 --> 26:16.567
Childish.

26:18.233 --> 26:20.667
I know you are. What am I?

26:26.067 --> 26:27.400
Huh?

27:39.600 --> 27:41.600
Feeling any better?

27:41.633 --> 27:43.633
Think so.

27:43.667 --> 27:45.600
Did it all come up?

27:46.667 --> 27:48.600
Mm.

27:49.767 --> 27:51.700
Saw some fish eating it.

27:52.633 --> 27:54.067
Did you?

27:54.833 --> 27:56.267
Yeah.
