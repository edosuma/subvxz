01:35.760 --> 01:37.000
How's that?

01:37.200 --> 01:41.000
Gotta hand it to you, Rico.
The old bean's working all the time.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.482
- What'll it be, gents?
- Spaghetti and coffee for two.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.563
All right, sir.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.131
What's that gotta do
with the price of eggs?

02:06.132 --> 02:07.932
Ah, plenty.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.804
Diamond Pete Montana.

02:11.200 --> 02:14.204
He don't have to waste his time
on cheap gas stations.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.882
He's somebody. He's in the big town
doing things in a big way.

02:18.040 --> 02:22.409
And look at us.
Just a couple of nobodies, nothing.

02:24.320 --> 02:28.530
Is that what you want, Rico?
A party like that for you?

02:30.360 --> 02:33.250
"Caesar Enrico Bandello.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.050
Honored by his friends. "

02:35.200 --> 02:38.090
I could do all the things
that fella does and more.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.483
Only I never got my chance.
And what's there to be afraid of?

02:41.680 --> 02:44.650
When I get in a tight spot,
I shoot my way out of it. Why, sure.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.007
Shoot first and argue aftervvards.

02:47.160 --> 02:50.084
You know, this game
ain't for guys that's soft.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.443
Yeah, there's money
in the big town, all right.

03:11.560 --> 03:14.962
And the women. Good times,
something doing all the time.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.361
Exciting things, you know.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.885
Gee.

03:19.040 --> 03:21.281
The clothes I could wear.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.646
And then I'd quit, Rico.

03:25.840 --> 03:28.923
I'd go back to dancing,
like I used to before I met you.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.811
I don't know. I ain't made
for this sort of thing.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.530
Dancing

03:33.680 --> 03:35.205
That's what I wanna do.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.970
Dancing?

03:37.120 --> 03:38.645
Women?

03:38.800 --> 03:41.644
And where do they get you?
I don't want no dancing.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.087
I'm figuring on making
other people dance.

03:44.280 --> 03:48.126
- Oh, I ain't forgetting about the money.
- Money's okay, but it ain't everything.

03:48.280 --> 03:52.604
Be somebody. Look hard at a bunch of guys
and know they'll do anything you tell them.

03:52.760 --> 03:55.525
Have your own way or nothing.
Be somebody.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.644
- You'll get there, Rico.
- Yeah.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.320
- You'll show them.
- You know...

04:01.480 --> 04:05.121
...this was our last stand
in this burg. We're pulling out.

04:05.480 --> 04:08.131
- Where are we going?
- East.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.850
Where things break big.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.964
So I beat it east, like I told you.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.202
That's all there is to it.

04:26.280 --> 04:30.171
I wanna run with your mob,
if you'll let me. What do you say?

04:30.560 --> 04:35.327
You won't be sorry for letting me in. I'll do
anything you say. I ain't afraid of nothing.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.050
You think you're a hard guy?

04:37.200 --> 04:40.204
There's nothing soft about me.
Nothing yellow. I don't quit.

04:40.360 --> 04:44.365
- You got an idea you're good, huh?
Give me a chance to show you.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.728
- What do you know about me?
- Oh, I heard plenty.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.042
How you run things this end of town.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.682
About this here Club Palermo,
how it's your front. I got told enough.

04:55.840 --> 04:59.208
- I guess you're good with a rod too, huh?
- Quick with it and sure.

04:59.400 --> 05:04.281
Well, that don't go around here.
That's old stuff. This ain't the sticks.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.882
Yeah, I get you.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.771
All right. You stick around.

05:10.920 --> 05:14.242
But, remember, I'm the boss.
And I give all the orders.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.927
And when we split, we split my way.

05:18.080 --> 05:22.529
- And no squawks. You get me?
- Yeah, sure, Mr. Vettori.

05:23.920 --> 05:27.129
- All right, come on in, meet the boys.
- Sure.

05:30.680 --> 05:34.526
Oh, they're 100 percent, all right.
Every one of them.

05:35.080 --> 05:39.210
There's Tony Passa. Can drive
a car better than any mug in the town.

05:39.400 --> 05:43.769
Otero. He's little,
but he's the goods, all right.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.763
Bat Carilla.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.524
Killer Peppi.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.409
Kid Bean.

05:49.560 --> 05:53.929
And this one here, Scabby.
What a smart guy he is.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.370
Boys.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.284
Come on, Tony. Wake up.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.730
I want you to meet a new guy
what's gonna be with us.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.490
This is, uh...

06:04.640 --> 06:08.531
_Uh_
- Caesar Enrico Bandello.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.643
Oh, Little Caesar, huh?

06:11.680 --> 06:13.967
Yeah, sure.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.640
Where did you get
the new dancer, DeVoss?

06:34.080 --> 06:36.162
Olga brought him around
a few days ago.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.084
Not bad.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.962
- All right.
- I'll say he is.

06:57.920 --> 07:01.686
Well, I got hold of a real dancer
for a partner, didn't I, Mr. Devoss?

07:02.320 --> 07:05.324
He's an elegant dancer.
We'll panic them after a few rehearsals.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.689
Say, you're not trying to sell him
to me, are you, Olga? Ha-ha-ha.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.889
Well, young fella, I guess
100 a week ought to buy you.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.247
That's more than I generally start with.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.688
That's swell with me, even though
it don't buy no limousines.

07:17.840 --> 07:21.526
Gee, thanks, Mr. Devoss.
You'll never be sorry for this.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.364
Come, Joey.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.887
So it's you and me from now on.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.727
Well, I'm glad.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.201
And I'm not ashamed to tell you.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.964
I guess you know by this time
how I feel about you.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.168
That's all right with you, isn't it?

07:40.320 --> 07:44.166
Or have you got another girl?
A steady, I mean.

07:44.520 --> 07:45.601
RAUGHS]

07:45.760 --> 07:48.411
Hundreds of them, sure. Only...

07:49.720 --> 07:51.484
Only, what's the difference?

07:51.640 --> 07:53.404
This is gonna be real.

07:53.560 --> 07:58.088
- We'll make it mean something.
- Yeah, Joey, let's.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.722
Because I need somebody.
Somebody like you.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.769
Awful bad.

08:03.960 --> 08:07.407
- You believe me, Olga?
- I want to believe you.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.964
What's that?

08:17.800 --> 08:19.086
What you got there, Joe?

08:26.760 --> 08:28.728
What are you doing with that?

08:34.640 --> 08:36.768
Can't you forget you've seen it?

08:37.200 --> 08:40.602
It won't make no difference.
Not between us, Olga.

08:42.039 --> 08:44.008
Heh-heh, don't worry, baby.

08:44.159 --> 08:47.323
It's just a little good-luck charm
I carry around with me.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.289
Is that your racket?

08:49.760 --> 08:51.330
Maybe.

08:54.480 --> 08:58.929
I suppose I got no right to ask you, Joe.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.964
But now...

09:01.120 --> 09:04.567
Now that we got an understanding.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.485
Couldn't you leave it?

09:11.400 --> 09:12.845
No.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.651
I suppose I haven't got the right.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.800
What would be the good
of you asking, kid?

09:18.960 --> 09:20.962
Once in a gang...

09:21.640 --> 09:24.291
- You know the rest.
- I don't want to know.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.171
Only maybe...

09:26.320 --> 09:28.891
Maybe it could be different this time.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.280
If we try.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.484
I've never seen the guy that could
get away with it yet.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.524
Black. Seven.

09:53.320 --> 09:56.688
Sam Vettori is still waiting
for you in your office.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.969
All right, I guess I'll have to see him.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.727
I wonder what he wants here.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.004
Hey, Ritz.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.765
You'd better stick with me.
I'll need you in there.

10:18.920 --> 10:23.369
- That Sam Vettori's a no-good lug.
- You said it, boss.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.961
Better let me go first.

10:29.240 --> 10:30.446
Cut that.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.449
Hello, Arnie.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.723
Surprised to see me
in your swell joint?

10:38.720 --> 10:41.564
Maybe I won't be after you
tell me what you want here.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.842
Oh, I'll tell you, all right.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.083
Diamond Pete asked me to come up.
He's coming up too.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.730
- Pete Montana?
That's who.

10:51.040 --> 10:55.125
Well, if Pete wants you here,
it's got to be all right with me.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.091
- Hello, Mr. Montana.
- Hello.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.126
Hello.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.928
- Hello, Arnie.
Hello, how are you?

11:13.080 --> 11:15.128
- Hello, Vettori.
- Hello, boss.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.924
Cigar?

11:18.360 --> 11:19.771
Thanks.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.446
Thanks, Arnie.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.444
Sit down, boys.
I got something to tell you.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.365
A message from the Big Boy.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.524
Now, listen. Here's the lowdown.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.082
- The Big Boy says-
- Just a minute, boss.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.890
Hey, you.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.805
Nobody asked you
to be butting in here, did they?

11:40.960 --> 11:43.327
- Screw, mug.
- You ain't giving me orders.

11:43.480 --> 11:46.882
You're a fresh guy, huh?
- Take it easy, Rico.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.804
You go out there and wait for me.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.488
Jake with me, boss.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.563
Now, listen, boys.
Watch this guy McClure...

12:09.720 --> 12:11.529
...what's head of
the new crime commission.

12:11.680 --> 12:15.605
He's putting the screws on,
and make no mistake about him.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.842
Now, the Big Boy wants me
to tell you guys...

12:18.000 --> 12:21.163
...to put the chains on your gorillas
for the next few months.

12:21.320 --> 12:24.529
Because if any of them go too far,
it'll be just too bad.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.165
Ah, heh.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.891
I've never seen nobody
the Big Boy couldn't get to.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.840
He can fix anything.
That's why he's the Big Boy.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.480
This bird McClure will be pie for him.

12:35.640 --> 12:39.361
- He'll twist him around his little finger.
- Don't kid yourself.

12:39.520 --> 12:44.287
Nobody's squaring nothing with McClure.
Not even the Big Boy.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.522
Small jobs, that's different.

12:46.680 --> 12:50.685
We could spring guys for them.
Butshoofing?

12:50.840 --> 12:52.490
No, sir.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.163
It's guys like this torpedo of yours
that cause all the trouble.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.041
Who, Rico? Heh-heh.

12:59.200 --> 13:03.922
He's all right. He's a little quick
on the trigger, but that's because he's new.

13:04.080 --> 13:08.051
Yeah? Well, it's us
that'll swing for him...

13:08.360 --> 13:10.727
...if he shoots at the wrong time.

13:10.880 --> 13:15.727
Now, remember what I told you.
Come on. So long.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.330
And you.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.802
You take it easy
with that cannon of yours.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.603
Did you hear me?

13:31.160 --> 13:32.525
Yes, Mr. Montana.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.810
- Good night.
- Good night.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.162
Good night.
Good night.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.961
Do yourself a favor, will you, Rico?

13:44.120 --> 13:47.169
Leave your gat home on the piano
the next job you pull.

13:47.320 --> 13:50.244
Yeah, park it next to your milk bottle.

13:50.400 --> 13:54.007
Hey. Run your own mob, Arnie.
I'll take care of mine.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.162
Yeah, I'll park it.

13:56.320 --> 14:00.769
I don't need no cannon to take care
of guys like you, Mr. Lorch.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.088
Yeah, we gotta be careful.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.607
Little Arnie's interested
in this here nightclub.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.168
- If it ever gets out who pulled the job-
- They'll never get wise to us.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.846
They're careless,
but they've never been tapped.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.162
Yeah, but I don't like the whole business.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.290
Neither do I, Sam. Honest, I don't.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.370
I couldn't sleep last night.
I was up worried.

14:43.520 --> 14:47.161
I don't want to take any chances. Not now
the way they're closing down on us.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.328
What's the matter, Tony, getting yellow?

14:49.480 --> 14:52.165
No, but, jeez, none of us
wanna hang, do we?

14:52.320 --> 14:55.608
You'd like to quit, wouldn't you?
You'd like to run out on us.

14:55.760 --> 14:59.082
- You're yellow, you dirty-
- Wait a minute, Rico.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.768
Where do you get that yellow stuff?

15:02.560 --> 15:05.166
You want to know who's yellow,
I'll tell you.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.005
Joe Massara, your pal.

15:08.160 --> 15:11.209
- That's why he didn't show tonight.
- He'll be here. Just because-

15:11.360 --> 15:16.082
I know all about that stuff. I'm gonna
give him 10 minutes more. Then we'll see.

15:16.240 --> 15:19.847
Now, listen, Sam, Joe's all right.
He's the best front man in the world.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.085
Why, he can go to a swell hotel
and order a suite, a suite, and it's all right.

15:24.240 --> 15:27.164
Without Joe, we can't pull the job,
and you know it.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.249
What's that paper?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.446
It's this layout I've been
figuring out with Scabby.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.523
- What, this nightclub job?
- Yeah.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.081
Well, let me see it.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.729
And until I say different...

15:45.920 --> 15:49.208
...nobody's gonna plan
for this mob but me.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.362
You get me?

16:05.520 --> 16:09.366
He'll learn.
Now, come here, you guys.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.686
Now, get this.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.084
Hello, Joe.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.244
Hello, Rico.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.650
Come here.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.280
I told you to be here at 8:30.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.601
Oh, well, you see, I-

16:32.800 --> 16:35.406
I was busy.
I was rehearsing, and...

16:35.560 --> 16:38.086
- Oh, you know how it is.
- Yeah, I know how it is.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.891
They've been saying it,
only I didn't believe them.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.930
They're crazy when they call you yellow.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.606
Aw. Tell them they can go to-

16:48.280 --> 16:51.443
Say, what's the big idea
of the rush anyway?

16:52.600 --> 16:55.285
It's a little job we need you for.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.761
A little job at the Bronze Peacock.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.284
What do you mean?

17:03.680 --> 17:06.160
Are you trying to kid me or something?

17:07.520 --> 17:10.648
How can I take the chance?
They're all my friends, they all know me.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.048
That's why, they'll never suspect you.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.009
Now, don't stall, Joe.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.810
I ain't stalling.

17:16.960 --> 17:21.887
You gotta get me out of this, Rico.
You gotta. I don't want to...

17:22.280 --> 17:26.126
Well, don't you see,
I'm working steady now, and...

17:26.640 --> 17:28.210
Can't a guy ever say he's through?

17:28.400 --> 17:31.324
You're gonna be in on this,
and you'll like it.

17:32.560 --> 17:36.645
The time is to be sharp midnight
on New Year's Eve.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.404
I won't. I can't.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.767
I can't, don't you see? I-

17:40.920 --> 17:42.126
Well, gee, I-

17:42.280 --> 17:45.762
- I'll be working New Year's Eve.
- Now, listen, Joe.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.281
This is the joint where you're working.

17:48.440 --> 17:51.011
And don't you be forgetting it, either.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.844
Come on in.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.002
Well, maybe it ain't so hot.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.322
- Maybe we can't buck Little Arnie.
I can.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.363
Ah, you're too good, that's what.

18:08.560 --> 18:12.849
Hello, Joe. You were in a big hurry
about getting here, weren't you?

18:13.880 --> 18:18.727
- Maybe this kind of work ain't to your liking.
- Joe's all right. He's in with us.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.370
Yeah, I'm in with you.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.243
Well, let's see, now.
Here's the way I dope this thing out.

18:27.320 --> 18:33.089
I, Sam Vettori, not you, Rico,
or nobody else.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.604
- That's plain, ain't it?
- Sure.

18:36.800 --> 18:40.327
Only, who stands here?
You kind of forgot that, didn't you?

18:40.480 --> 18:44.849
Hey, I'm boss on this job, not you.
Right here.

18:46.040 --> 18:49.886
Smart guy, Rico.
He's got plenty of brains.

18:50.480 --> 18:53.609
I tell you, I'm afraid, Otero. I'm afraid.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.730
Ah, you're crazy. Rico's coming with us.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.406
Come on now, buck up. Don't be scared.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.483
And you, Joe.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.610
You'll be in the lobby
and give us the high sign...

19:04.760 --> 19:08.082
...if everything's on the up and up.
You get me?

19:08.240 --> 19:12.290
Yeah, and if we get in a jam, you'll have
to take a chance with the rest of us.

19:35.360 --> 19:38.045
Hey, quiet, quiet.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.044
Holy Moses, it's Alvin McClure.

19:41.240 --> 19:44.050
The crime commission buzzard.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.926
Hey, Devoss. (Some here.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.161
What is it, Arnie? What is it?

19:50.440 --> 19:53.808
Bring McClure over here,
I want to buy him a lemonade.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.570
- Not tonight, some other time.
- Go on. Do as you're told.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.891
Go on, DeVoss, bring him here.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.929
As you wish.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.127
What can I order for you?

20:10.280 --> 20:13.250
- Good evening, Mr. McClure.
- Good evening, DeVoss.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.408
- Quite a party, eh?
- Thank you.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.131
Delighted to have you with us, folks.
Heh-heh.

20:18.320 --> 20:23.008
Mr. McClure, a Mr. Lorch,
a financial backer of mine...

20:23.200 --> 20:24.645
...would like to meet you.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.566
- May I bring him over to your table?
- Lorch? Lorch?

20:28.720 --> 20:32.281
- You mean the man they call Little Arnie?
- Yes, but-

20:32.440 --> 20:35.922
- You say he's a financial backer of yours?
- Yes, but-

20:36.080 --> 20:40.051
I didn't understand that a man of his type
was connected with this place.

20:40.200 --> 20:44.808
I'm sorry, DeVoss, but you might
inform Mr. Lorch that we're leaving.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.327
I came to this place
under a misapprehension.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.562
- Now, Mr. McClure-
- I'm sorry, folks...

20:49.720 --> 20:51.688
...but we'll have to go somewhere else.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.641
You like my hair this way, Joey?

21:01.480 --> 21:03.050
Sure.

21:04.320 --> 21:07.529
I used to wear it-
Where are you going?

21:09.960 --> 21:13.851
- Just to get a package of cigarettes.
- Hurry back, darling, it's almost 12:00

21:14.040 --> 21:16.691
...and I wanna be with you
for New Year's.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.763
I'll be back in a minute.

22:07.880 --> 22:10.929
- What can I get you?
A Victor Noble.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.601
Stay where you are.

22:47.320 --> 22:50.051
Oh, help! Oh, God!

23:01.080 --> 23:03.686
Open her up, Tony, this ain't no picnic.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.605
What's the matter, Tony,
losing your nerve?

23:08.760 --> 23:13.448
Come on, let's go. Let's go,
we gotta get out of here. Come on.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.002
Happy New Year.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.209
Why, Joe...

23:29.000 --> 23:30.570
Joey.

23:31.680 --> 23:34.650
What is it? What's the matter?

23:36.320 --> 23:37.685
Nothing.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.930
It's all right.

23:44.680 --> 23:47.763
- The joint's been held up, that's all.
- Held up?

23:47.920 --> 23:49.410
Theynn

23:49.760 --> 23:52.570
- They shot McClure.
- Joe.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.165
- Now you know.
- It was you.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.884
- No. No, it's a lie! I-
- You shot McClure.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.368
No, I didn't, I swear.
It wasn't me that shot him. It was-

24:05.640 --> 24:07.802
I don't know who.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.764
But it's our hips for this job, all right.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.204
Maybe- Maybe everything
will be all right, Joey.

24:20.360 --> 24:23.284
Maybe he wasn't hurt badly.

24:23.480 --> 24:26.370
But you're through with that bunch.
You don't belong, Joe.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.409
You're not that kind.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.881
You'll never go near them again.

24:32.440 --> 24:34.044
Olga...

24:35.480 --> 24:37.482
...you can't go back...

24:38.680 --> 24:40.409
...on a gang.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.646
Well, everything come off
all right? Tell me.

24:46.880 --> 24:51.169
Everything was all right.
Only I had to take care of a guy.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.970
- Who was it?
- McClure.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.483
McClure.

24:58.240 --> 25:01.050
You shot McClure.

25:01.840 --> 25:07.609
A million guys in this town, and you
had to pick the crime commissioner.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.090
What did I tell you, Rico?

25:10.240 --> 25:12.891
Didn't I say to make it clean?
Didn't I say no gunplay?

25:13.040 --> 25:15.441
Think I'm going to let a guy
pull a gat on me?

25:15.600 --> 25:17.887
Any more of these cracks,
and this is my last job.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.521
The head of the crime commission.

25:21.680 --> 25:24.524
The Big Boy can't do us
no good this trip.

25:24.680 --> 25:27.445
They'll get us dead sure now.

25:27.600 --> 25:31.446
- What am I gonna do?
- Why don't you go and give yourself up?

25:31.600 --> 25:33.090
You're slipping, Sam.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.607
And Tony, what about him?
Where is he?

25:35.800 --> 25:39.122
Getting rid of the car.
Tony got nervous. He's like a big baby

26:23.000 --> 26:25.685
What a fine pickle we're in.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.486
You and that rod of yours.

26:40.360 --> 26:43.011
Flaherty's downstairs,
a couple of dicks with him

26:43.200 --> 26:44.690
They're coming right up.

26:44.840 --> 26:46.808
Stay where you are, all of you.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.527
They won't know nothing unless they
picked Tony up. Give them the shaft.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.768
I'll be in here listening.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.370
Happy New Year, boys.

27:07.640 --> 27:11.042
Say, there's a lonesome
touring car down the street.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.568
I was wondering if you happened
to know anything about it.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.848
How should I know anything about it?

27:17.000 --> 27:21.005
- Ain't it got license plates on it?
- Yes, but they're phony.

27:21.200 --> 27:24.010
It was stolen on the north side tonight.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.568
Oh, I got a good cafÃ© business.

27:26.720 --> 27:29.405
I don't know nothing about automobiles
what's been stolen.

27:29.560 --> 27:32.723
Well, you might if some of
the bright young men around here...

27:32.920 --> 27:35.730
...had anything to do with it,
wouldn't you?

27:36.200 --> 27:39.921
- Wasn't there anybody in it?
- Yes, one guy.

27:40.080 --> 27:43.641
But not when we got there. He beat it.

27:44.760 --> 27:47.923
But we got a good description
of him, though.

27:48.440 --> 27:51.091
I'm telling you,
I don't know nothing about it.

27:52.760 --> 27:54.762
Well, come on, fellas.

27:54.920 --> 27:59.164
As long as Vettori
doesn't know anything about it.

28:01.840 --> 28:05.287
Oh, say, have you heard
the news, Vettori?

28:05.760 --> 28:07.603
No, what?

28:07.760 --> 28:12.288
Someone knocked off Alvin McClure
over at the Bronze Peacock.

28:12.720 --> 28:16.088
McClure? No, that's terrible.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.969
Some guys are sure careless
with the lead, all right.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.770
What a tough break for Arnie.

28:21.920 --> 28:26.289
It's gonna be a tough break
for a lot of birds.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.291
Well, so long.

28:33.080 --> 28:37.961
Oh, I forgot to wish you fellas
a merry Christmas.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.601
Tony, I can't figure him.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.364
The kid's a great driver.

29:11.560 --> 29:14.882
- Oh, he must've lost his nerve.
- I'll take care of him.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.805
- Let's see the color of that money.
- Just a minute, Sam.

29:18.960 --> 29:22.362
I got my own ideas of a split.
And you can take it or leave it.

29:22.520 --> 29:25.922
- We ain't begging you.
- Yeah, well, I bossed this job...

29:26.080 --> 29:28.003
...and I'm gonna get my split.

29:28.200 --> 29:31.807
How'd you boss this job?
By sitting here cheating at solitaire?

29:31.960 --> 29:34.964
Well, that don't go no more,
not with me. We're done.

29:35.120 --> 29:39.125
- I've been taking orders from you too long.
- You'll keep on taking orders too...

29:39.280 --> 29:43.126
- ... or you'll get out of here so fast...
- Maybe it won't be me that gets out.

29:43.280 --> 29:46.887
No? Well, maybe the boys
have got something to say about that.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.690
What about it?

29:59.320 --> 30:01.607
So that's it, huh?

30:01.760 --> 30:05.242
Yeah, that's it, all right.

30:05.760 --> 30:10.129
You can dish it out, but you're getting so
you can't take it no more. You're through.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.725
Well?

30:17.000 --> 30:19.480
Well, the split's okay with me, Rico.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.608
How about you boys?

30:24.320 --> 30:26.891
No hard feelings, eh, Sam?

30:29.680 --> 30:31.682
We gotta stick together.

30:31.840 --> 30:35.401
There's a rope around my neck right now,
and they only hang you once.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.046
If anybody turns yellow and squeals...

30:38.200 --> 30:40.851
...my gun's gonna speak its piece.

30:52.760 --> 30:55.604
What's the matter, Antonio?

30:55.760 --> 30:58.047
Why you don't sleep?

30:58.560 --> 31:01.404
- You sick, maybe? Huh?
- Yeah.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.484
- Oh, what-?
- No, can't a guy get up when he wants to...

31:04.640 --> 31:06.563
...without answering a lot of questions?

31:06.760 --> 31:09.411
You stay out late nights,
you drink lot of wine.

31:09.560 --> 31:13.007
- Leave me alone.
- Oh, listen, Antonio, I-

31:15.760 --> 31:19.003
I have some spaghetti for you
on the stove.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.640
If you feel better, eat some.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.610
Yes? It do you good.

31:27.480 --> 31:30.962
You used to be a good boy, Antonio.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.487
Remember when you sing in the church?

31:33.640 --> 31:36.211
In the choir with Father McNeil?

31:36.720 --> 31:39.166
You in white.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.009
Remember?

31:44.840 --> 31:46.444
Father McNeil.

31:47.360 --> 31:49.840
The church was beautiful.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.083
You little boy with long hair.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.766
The tall, big candles.

31:55.920 --> 31:57.763
Flowers.

32:00.320 --> 32:03.005
Remember, Antonio?

32:21.840 --> 32:24.161
Don't leave me, Ma, do you hear?

32:27.040 --> 32:29.805
You don't have to go now, do you?

32:29.960 --> 32:32.088
Can't you stay a little while with me?

32:32.240 --> 32:33.924
Please, don't go away.

32:34.080 --> 32:38.051
- Please.
- Oh, Antonio. Oh, my baby.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.771
I no go, I stay.

32:40.920 --> 32:42.888
Antonio.

32:43.040 --> 32:46.123
Oh, my boy.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.528
I'll be all right, Ma.

32:57.480 --> 32:59.960
- You'd better run along, do you hear?
- Yes.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.889
You run along.

33:02.520 --> 33:05.171
Take good care of yourself,
will you, huh?

33:06.160 --> 33:10.643
And give my love
to Miss Manccia, will you, huh?

33:39.760 --> 33:42.047
Father McNeil.

33:58.520 --> 34:01.763
Hey, Tony. Where you been?
I'm looking all over for you.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.969
Rico wants you to come
and get your split.

34:05.640 --> 34:08.484
What's the matter, Tony?
Don't you want a split?

34:08.960 --> 34:10.803
Are you crazy?

34:10.960 --> 34:12.405
I'm not crazy.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.722
And I don't want no split.

34:15.440 --> 34:16.929
Listen, Tony.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.286
Rico knows you lose your nerve

34:19.440 --> 34:21.283
Now, he wants you to be a man.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.408
You better not turn yellow.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.847
Get away from me, Otero.
Leave me alone!

34:26.040 --> 34:28.485
Listen, kid. I'm trying to tell you
for your own good.

34:28.639 --> 34:30.563
- Come with me and get your split.
- Ah!

34:30.719 --> 34:32.210
Hey, TOW!

34:32.360 --> 34:34.089
Tony, where you going?

34:34.239 --> 34:36.891
I'm going to see Father McNeil.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.447
Rico!

34:43.679 --> 34:45.523
I found Tony, but it's too late.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.170
He's crazy! Crazy!

34:47.320 --> 34:50.529
I tell him to be a man, but he shakes
his head and goes to the priest.

34:50.679 --> 34:53.967
Well, I guess that's that.
We ain't got any time to lose.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.963
Come on, Sam, get a car, and let's go.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.202
Not me! Take- Take Scabby.

34:58.360 --> 34:59.964
- Scabby's no good.
No. I'm not.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.525
- Can you drive, Otero?
- Sure!

35:01.680 --> 35:04.524
All right, let's go.
We'll use the black roadster.

35:12.960 --> 35:15.042
There he is.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.804
Tony!

35:38.560 --> 35:40.369
Did you see all them wreaths?

35:40.520 --> 35:42.966
That hearse is sure decked out pretty.

35:43.160 --> 35:46.164
Well, this was no time
to be tight with money.

35:46.320 --> 35:49.642
Tony deserved a swell send-off.

35:49.800 --> 35:53.122
- Poor kid.
- Yeah, but Rico's wreath beat them all.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.964
It was big.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.487
And all it had on it was "Tony. "

35:57.640 --> 36:02.248
- Not even Rico's name.
- Yeah. Rico's no braggart.

36:02.480 --> 36:05.245
Tony looked like he was asleep.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.926
Didn't look a bit changed.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.242
Beats me how they do it.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.562
Got a match?

36:18.280 --> 36:22.444
- Look, Rico. There's Flaherty, the bull.
- Huh?

36:25.240 --> 36:26.969
Aah. Hmph.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.127
Things must be getting pretty hot.
What's he want?

36:31.280 --> 36:33.931
He's just stalling.
They ain't got a thing on me.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.811
Gee, we're moving slow.

36:40.200 --> 36:44.205
We got plenty of time.
The banquet won't start until 8.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.203
Yeah.

36:48.920 --> 36:51.764
Too bad Tony won't be there.

37:02.480 --> 37:06.485
Yeah, that's the goods, all right.
That's the fanciest I've ever seen, Sam.

37:06.640 --> 37:09.325
Look at those
little turtledoves down here.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.926
Friendship and loyalty, huh?

37:12.120 --> 37:14.930
- Well, how do you like that, Sam? Huh?
Pretty good, Rico.

37:15.080 --> 37:17.924
Otero told me I don't look good
in a derby. What do you think?

37:18.080 --> 37:19.844
- Looks just like you.
- I thought so.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.129
I guess I'll stick to them from now on.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.805
"Compliments to a true pal.

37:24.960 --> 37:27.201
Mr. C. Bandello from a true pal...

37:27.360 --> 37:30.045
...Mr. Sam Vettori. " Well, that's nice.

37:30.200 --> 37:33.602
I appreciate, Sam. That's swell of you.

37:50.640 --> 37:55.521
Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!

37:56.440 --> 37:58.090
What's the matter with you birds?

37:58.320 --> 38:00.527
Don't you know how to act at a banquet?

38:00.680 --> 38:03.604
What do you think you are,
a lot of gashouse yaps?

38:03.800 --> 38:06.326
Well, cut the chatter.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.321
Scabby's gonna make a speech.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.245
Well, folks...

38:19.440 --> 38:22.011
...you all know what we're here for...

38:22.160 --> 38:26.051
...so what's the good of me
telling you all about it?

38:27.240 --> 38:29.925
Rico here is a great guy!

38:36.720 --> 38:39.166
Sure, and, uh...

38:39.320 --> 38:41.243
Well...

38:42.360 --> 38:43.850
Say, Rico...

38:44.000 --> 38:47.800
...I don't know how to talk fancy, but...

38:49.240 --> 38:52.403
This here watch is for you, see?

38:52.760 --> 38:55.684
- From the boys!
- Come on, everybody. Clap, like.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.000
Speech!
Speech!

39:05.160 --> 39:07.527
Oh, no, no, no.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.606
Speech!
- Oh, well.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.410
All right.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.767
You birds want me to make a speech?

39:15.920 --> 39:17.922
Here it goes.

39:18.680 --> 39:23.288
L- I want to thank you, fellas,
for this here banquet.

39:23.440 --> 39:25.841
It sure is swell.

39:27.280 --> 39:29.328
The liquor is good, so they tell me.

39:30.720 --> 39:33.121
But I don't drink it, myself.

39:33.280 --> 39:37.171
And the food don't leave
nothing to be desired.

39:37.880 --> 39:41.123
Well, I guess we're all
having a swell time...

39:41.280 --> 39:45.080
...and it sure is good to see
all you gents with your molls here.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.210
Yeah.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.811
Well, I...

39:49.960 --> 39:51.325
I guess that's about all.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.167
And I wish you birds wouldn't get
drunk and raise Cain...

39:57.320 --> 39:59.482
...because that's the way
a lot of birds get bumped off.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.484
Yeah. Lay off that stuff.
I know what I'm-

40:02.640 --> 40:06.406
A couple of newspaper guys out there want
to take a picture. What do you say, boss?

40:06.560 --> 40:08.449
Well, what do you think of that, huh?
Heh.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.841
Sure. Send them in.
Tell them to make it snappy.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.843
- I'll see you later.
- Oh, don't go away.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.970
- We're going to have our pictures taken.
- I haven't had my picture taken...

40:16.120 --> 40:18.361
...in the last 15 years.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.526
Well, what do you think of that?
Fifteen years, he hasn't-

40:21.680 --> 40:23.728
Come on, boys, make it snappy.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.966
Come on, now! Quiet, everybody!

40:28.120 --> 40:29.929
We're gonna get mugged!

40:34.040 --> 40:37.010
There you are. Now, hold it.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.968
Hold it, still!

40:50.200 --> 40:53.761
- Look at the guys over there.
- That was a bad play you made then, Rico.

40:53.920 --> 40:55.410
That flashlight.

40:55.560 --> 40:58.723
- They might pick you up on that.
- Well, what do I care?

40:58.880 --> 41:01.281
Don't I want folks to see
what the boys think of me?

41:01.440 --> 41:06.526
Hey, Rico, what become of that pal
of yours, that dancer guy, Joe Massara?

41:10.440 --> 41:12.329
He didn't come.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.971
He ain't been around in a long time.

41:16.160 --> 41:18.527
He didn't quit on you, did he, Rico?

41:18.920 --> 41:21.161
Bad business to quit on me, Sam.

41:21.360 --> 41:23.408
One guy tried that on me once.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.209
Now, you mind your own business
and let me tend to my own.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.487
What does that bull want in here?

41:34.640 --> 41:37.928
- I'll show him where he gets off.
- Careful, Rico.

41:39.720 --> 41:41.882
Who invited you here?

41:42.160 --> 41:44.970
You're getting up in the world,
aren't you, Rico?

41:46.680 --> 41:49.126
The downstairs is open to anybody,
even cops.

41:49.280 --> 41:50.645
But the upstairs is private.

41:51.240 --> 41:54.722
Thanks, but I like to keep
my eye on you, Rico.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.803
You see, I'm your friend.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.844
I like to see a young fellow
getting up in the world...

42:00.000 --> 42:01.923
...that's all.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.326
So long.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.610
Hurry back.

42:06.280 --> 42:07.611
I Will.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.164
Oh, say...

42:12.360 --> 42:16.046
Somebody threw a brick through
Meyer Blum's window last night.

42:16.200 --> 42:19.170
Do you happen to know anything
about a diamond-and-platinum watch...

42:19.320 --> 42:21.641
...that was stolen, do you?

42:23.120 --> 42:26.522
If you hear anything about it,
let me know, won't you?

42:40.080 --> 42:41.161
Hm.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.125
Banquet, eh?

43:02.680 --> 43:04.364
Hmm.

43:04.880 --> 43:07.167
Rico got far...

43:07.960 --> 43:09.564
...too far.

43:09.720 --> 43:11.768
So now he's got to stop.

43:11.920 --> 43:13.570
I'm saying he's got to stop!

43:13.720 --> 43:16.690
Oh, Arnie, are you fellas
going to start another scrap?

43:16.840 --> 43:19.446
What's the use of my paying
heavy dues for protection...

43:19.600 --> 43:22.843
- ... if there's no peace?
- Don't worry. There'll be peace soon enough.

43:23.680 --> 43:26.411
I'm saying he's got to stop,
so he's gonna stop.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.722
He's been cutting in on my territory...

43:28.880 --> 43:31.406
...and that's all wet with me.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.168
Look, ahem.

43:34.720 --> 43:37.041
I'm sitting here, see?

43:37.200 --> 43:39.362
I'm sitting here quiet...

43:39.520 --> 43:42.000
...smoking a cigarette, see?

43:42.400 --> 43:44.368
But a couple of my boys
ain't sitting here.

43:45.360 --> 43:50.571
They're out looking for Rico, and they
got their gats with them too. Catch on?

43:50.880 --> 43:56.250
And when they find him, it won't be no
banquet that Rico gets. It will be a wake!

44:00.680 --> 44:03.047
Arnie, you know best.

44:03.720 --> 44:04.926
I've never met Rico.

44:09.240 --> 44:11.208
Phelps, 2284.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.364
Hello, Otero. This is Joe Massara.

44:14.520 --> 44:16.329
I just found out something. This is hot.

44:16.480 --> 44:19.768
Tell Rico to look out. Little Arnie's gang
is out to put one in him.

44:20.560 --> 44:22.528
What's the matter?

44:23.040 --> 44:25.691
- Where is Rico?
- You got me. He ain't showed up yet.

44:25.840 --> 44:28.047
Come on, quick! We got to find him!

44:31.160 --> 44:33.049
I want 10 of these.

44:36.080 --> 44:38.242
Gee, you taking
all these papers, Mr. Rico?

44:38.440 --> 44:40.488
Why, sure. Ain't I got
my picture in them?

44:42.000 --> 44:43.764
Here.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.446
- Thanks! Come again!
- That's all right.

45:27.480 --> 45:29.164
Fine shots you are!

45:29.320 --> 45:31.129
Oh, no!

45:45.840 --> 45:48.320
So somebody finally put one in you.

45:48.480 --> 45:50.005
Yeah, but they just grazed me.

45:50.160 --> 45:52.606
The old man will be glad to hear it.

45:52.760 --> 45:54.524
He takes such an interest in you.

45:54.680 --> 45:57.843
Tell him the cops couldn't get me no other
way, so they hired a couple of gunmen.

45:59.840 --> 46:02.923
If I wasn't on the force,
I'd have done the job cheap.

46:03.120 --> 46:05.885
Did you ever think how you'd look
with a lily in your hand?

46:06.040 --> 46:07.565
No, I never did.

46:07.720 --> 46:12.282
I've been in this game a good many years,
and I put the cuffs on a lot of mugs.

46:12.440 --> 46:15.364
Someday, you and I
are gonna take a ride, Rico...

46:15.520 --> 46:18.444
...and when we do,
I'll have the cuffs on you too.

46:18.880 --> 46:22.202
No buzzard like you
will ever put any cuffs on Rico.

46:23.400 --> 46:26.404
Hmph. Come on, boys.

46:29.200 --> 46:34.843
I'm gonna get that swell-headed mug
if it's the last thing I ever do.

46:35.400 --> 46:37.880
Boss, I'm sorry.
I should have been with you.

46:38.040 --> 46:41.840
They thought they hit the target, boss,
but bullets just bounce off of you.

46:44.600 --> 46:47.922
It was Little Arnie, Rico.
Joe Massara got the tip, and he called up.

46:48.080 --> 46:49.525
We couldn't find you in time.

46:49.880 --> 46:51.120
Joe,huh?

46:52.120 --> 46:53.360
Well.

46:54.400 --> 46:56.368
I didn't think he cared enough.

46:57.560 --> 46:59.927
Well, that was white of him, all right.

47:00.080 --> 47:02.481
I ought to give him a chance
on my next job.

47:02.640 --> 47:05.291
There. Guess I didn't study medicine
for nothing, did I?

47:05.440 --> 47:07.204
Thanks, Scabby.

47:07.920 --> 47:10.082
I'm going to see Little Arnie tonight.

47:10.240 --> 47:13.244
If he's looking for trouble,
why, that's what we got the most of.

47:13.400 --> 47:16.643
I want Killer Peppi,
Otero, Kid Bean and Bat to go with me.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.245
Hmph.

47:32.440 --> 47:35.649
Listen, handsome, open up,
or you'll tell nobody nothing no more.

47:43.200 --> 47:45.806
Tell him we're all right,
and don't act nervous.

47:58.360 --> 48:00.203
These fellas are all right.

48:03.480 --> 48:04.891
Come on, stick them up.

48:05.040 --> 48:06.405
Lock that door.

48:06.560 --> 48:07.766
Where's Arnie?

48:07.920 --> 48:09.331
In the office?

48:09.480 --> 48:11.926
Bat, stay outside that door
and don't let anybody in.

48:12.080 --> 48:14.731
Kid, you keep them covered.
Peppi and Otero, follow me.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.803
Come on, you. Give him the knock.

48:24.240 --> 48:25.287
Over there.

48:29.280 --> 48:31.726
Come on! Put them up!
Put them up! Come on!

48:38.320 --> 48:40.163
Hello, Arnie.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.846
- How's business?
- What's the game?

48:52.640 --> 48:55.644
I don't know what this is all about,
but it's a private row.

48:55.800 --> 48:59.771
- You guys better beat it.
- Ain't nobody gonna leave this room.

48:59.920 --> 49:02.446
You guys are invited
to this private party.

49:02.600 --> 49:04.568
Suppose we don't want to stay?

49:04.720 --> 49:06.927
I wouldn't stop you for the world.

49:07.160 --> 49:10.130
Only these boys
of mine have itching fingers.

49:11.080 --> 49:12.844
Sit down, gents.

49:16.080 --> 49:17.650
Arnie...

49:17.800 --> 49:21.361
...you ought to have better sense
than to hire a couple of outside yaps...

49:21.560 --> 49:23.847
...especially bad shots.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.207
Come on. What is it?
Let's have it!

49:28.400 --> 49:29.606
Arnie...

49:30.240 --> 49:31.810
...you're through.

49:31.960 --> 49:34.611
You hire these mugs, they miss.
Now you're through.

49:34.760 --> 49:36.922
If you ain't out of town
by tomorrow morning...

49:37.080 --> 49:40.163
...you won't ever leave it
except in a pine box.

49:41.400 --> 49:43.801
I'm taking over this territory.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.684
From now on, it's mine.

49:46.720 --> 49:48.529
You're growing, Rico.

49:48.680 --> 49:50.921
So this is what you've been after
all the time, huh?

49:51.080 --> 49:54.004
I seen it in your eyes
the first time I met you.

49:54.160 --> 49:56.208
You're no good, Rico.

49:56.360 --> 50:00.649
If you think you can muscle in on me like
you did on Sam Vettori, you're off your nut!

50:00.800 --> 50:04.088
I suppose you forgot
all about Pete Montana, huh?

50:06.600 --> 50:10.650
How's Diamond Pete going to stop me?
He may be your boss, but he ain't mine.

50:10.800 --> 50:12.768
Sam didn't feel that way about him.

50:12.920 --> 50:15.241
- Sam knew who gave orders.
- Sam was too soft.

50:15.400 --> 50:17.767
Diamond Pete could scare him,
but I ain't no Sam.

50:17.920 --> 50:19.445
Sam is through.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.921
Now you're through too.

50:25.800 --> 50:28.167
Nice stickpin you got there, Arnie.

50:33.800 --> 50:35.928
Nothing phony about my jewelry.

50:39.320 --> 50:40.560
Arnie...

50:41.920 --> 50:43.888
...you better quit this racket.

50:44.680 --> 50:49.083
You can dish it out, but you got
so that you can't take it no more.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.762
You'd better take your hats and beat it.

50:52.920 --> 50:56.641
The first thing you know, you'll be arrested
for firing a rod in the city limits.

50:59.680 --> 51:00.920
Well...

51:01.760 --> 51:03.285
...I guess that's about all.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.890
Oh, uh...

51:11.040 --> 51:13.122
Pleasant trip, gents.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.764
Come on, boys.

51:20.560 --> 51:23.882
Oh, thanks, boys, for the artillery.

51:51.200 --> 51:56.047
- Well, boys. What do you think of it?
- Scabby, you're in the wrong job. It's perfect.

51:58.360 --> 52:00.488
That means you have a new partner.

52:01.760 --> 52:03.842
Little Caesar.

52:17.680 --> 52:20.968
Everybody'll laugh at Scabby's story.

52:21.800 --> 52:25.691
Gee, boss. You gave Arnie
an awful walloping.

52:26.920 --> 52:28.570
Rico...

52:31.720 --> 52:34.041
Now you're famous.

52:35.040 --> 52:37.008
You see, Otero.

52:37.160 --> 52:40.562
There ain't no use in being scared
of any of these big guys.

52:40.760 --> 52:43.491
The bigger they come,
the harder they fall.

52:43.680 --> 52:45.762
Hmph. Yeah.

52:45.920 --> 52:49.402
I ain't doing so bad
in this business so far.

52:55.240 --> 52:57.049
Well, now.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.123
Ah, you look great, boss.

52:59.320 --> 53:01.084
Yeah, but it feels terrible.

53:01.280 --> 53:04.409
Aw. You're getting up in the world, Rico.

53:04.560 --> 53:07.769
None of us ever been invited up
to eat at the Big Boy's dump.

53:07.920 --> 53:10.685
And nobody ever crashed the gate
except Pete Montana.

53:10.840 --> 53:12.080
See what I mean?

53:12.240 --> 53:15.722
Now, you don't want the Big Boy
to think you ain't got no class.

53:15.920 --> 53:18.446
They rig you up better than this
in the stir.

53:18.600 --> 53:20.967
If you think I'm going out
in this, you're crazy!

53:21.120 --> 53:22.406
You look fine, boss.

53:22.560 --> 53:25.484
- Go on. Take a peek at yourself.
- Oh, I don't know.

53:27.120 --> 53:30.602
All I need is a napkin over my arm.

53:32.960 --> 53:36.442
Now, don't you look fine?

53:37.240 --> 53:38.844
Hm?

53:41.080 --> 53:42.889
Yeah.

53:43.040 --> 53:45.486
I guess maybe I don't look so bad
after all.

53:57.040 --> 53:59.327
Oh, hello. Oh.

53:59.480 --> 54:02.484
- Hello, Big Boy.
Hello, Rico.

54:03.360 --> 54:05.840
Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

54:06.680 --> 54:08.682
Thanks very much.

54:13.120 --> 54:15.327
Well, you're rather
lit up tonight, aren't you?

54:15.640 --> 54:19.247
Yeah. I thought I better put on
a monkey suit.

54:19.440 --> 54:21.841
That's right. You may as well learn now.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.206
Yeah.

54:23.520 --> 54:24.726
Well...

54:25.720 --> 54:27.245
Some joint you got here.

54:27.760 --> 54:29.444
It'll do.

54:29.960 --> 54:31.325
Yeah.

54:31.480 --> 54:34.370
I bet all this trick furniture
set you back plenty, huh?

54:34.520 --> 54:37.410
Well, they don't exactly give it away
with cigar coupons.

54:37.560 --> 54:39.642
Well, I'll tell the world. Heh.

54:39.800 --> 54:41.370
Boy, it sure look-

54:41.520 --> 54:42.851
Oh, look at that.

54:43.520 --> 54:46.285
Do you like it?
Oh, I think it's elegant.

54:47.360 --> 54:49.362
That cost me $15,000.

54:49.920 --> 54:51.888
Fifteen thou-

54:54.360 --> 54:57.364
Boy, them gold frames
sure cost plenty of dough.

54:57.560 --> 55:00.404
Well, will you have a cocktail
or a dash of brandy?

55:00.560 --> 55:02.767
Oh, no, thanks.
I never touch the stuff.

55:02.960 --> 55:04.371
- No?
- Heh, no.

55:04.520 --> 55:07.729
- Cigar, then?
- Oh, yeah. I'll have one of those.

55:07.880 --> 55:09.644
Thanks.

55:09.800 --> 55:11.802
Thanks very much.

55:13.480 --> 55:16.245
- Sit down, Rico.
- Yeah. Thanks.

55:17.800 --> 55:19.609
Mm.

55:21.120 --> 55:23.327
Boy, heh-heh.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.767
Now, listen, Rico.

55:29.480 --> 55:33.530
I'm gonna talk to you, but you're not
gonna hear a word I say, see?

55:33.720 --> 55:37.930
This is inside dope, and if it gets out,
it'll be just too bad for somebody.

55:38.080 --> 55:39.844
You know me.

55:40.560 --> 55:42.562
All right. Get this.

55:42.720 --> 55:45.121
Pete Montana's through.

55:45.720 --> 55:47.449
Yeah?

55:48.560 --> 55:49.925
Well.

55:50.080 --> 55:53.129
- And I thought he was such a big guy.
- He's through.

55:55.320 --> 55:58.290
Suppose I were to tell you
that from now on...

55:58.440 --> 55:59.965
...you were Pete Montana.

56:01.200 --> 56:04.488
That you were to take over his territory
in addition to your own.

56:04.640 --> 56:06.483
Would you shake on it?

56:06.640 --> 56:07.926
Would I?

56:09.280 --> 56:11.760
Would I? Heh-heh.

56:14.120 --> 56:16.407
All right. It's set.

56:17.440 --> 56:20.967
I'm doing a lot for you, Rico,
but when I get you planted...

56:21.120 --> 56:23.248
...I'll expect plenty of service.

56:23.440 --> 56:25.408
Well, you'll sure get it.

56:26.640 --> 56:30.361
Permit me, then, to drink
to the new boss of the North Side.

56:30.520 --> 56:32.488
Thank you. Heh.

56:56.200 --> 56:58.646
Otero, what did I tell you, huh?

56:58.800 --> 57:00.370
Heh-heh.

57:02.520 --> 57:04.488
I knew it was coming.

57:04.640 --> 57:07.644
I knew he had his eyes on me
all the time.

57:07.960 --> 57:09.962
And let me tell you something, Otero.

57:10.120 --> 57:13.841
It's not only Pete Montana that's through,
but the Big Boy himself.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.843
He ain't what he used to be.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.685
Pretty soon, he won't be
able to take it, and then...

57:19.520 --> 57:21.204
...watch me.

57:21.360 --> 57:22.486
Sure, boss.

57:22.640 --> 57:24.802
Pretty soon, you'll be running
the whole town.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.207
Otero, you said a mouthful.

57:30.880 --> 57:34.487
There's a guy by the name of Massara
out there. He wants to see you, sir.

57:35.360 --> 57:37.931
- I'll see him in a minute.
- Yes, sir.

57:38.360 --> 57:41.364
What's Joe want here?
He hasn't been near any of us for months.

57:41.560 --> 57:43.005
I sent for him.

57:43.160 --> 57:46.687
I heard somebody in Detroit got to Flaherty
and told him to start working...

57:46.840 --> 57:51.448
...on a dancer at the Bronze Peacock
if he wanted to find out who shot McClure.

57:52.200 --> 57:54.771
Gee, boss, you're wise to everything
before it happens.

57:54.920 --> 57:56.524
Yeah, I don't miss much.

57:56.680 --> 58:00.890
I'll soon find out if Flaherty's been working
on Joe after I have a little talk with him.

58:18.200 --> 58:21.124
Gee, Rico, what a palace.

58:21.480 --> 58:23.084
Oh, hello, Joe.

58:24.880 --> 58:26.723
Yeah, it'll do.

58:26.880 --> 58:30.282
But what do you expect?
Ain't I got 20 grand tied up in it?

58:31.360 --> 58:34.762
- Hello, Otero. How are you, baby?
- First-rate.

58:34.920 --> 58:36.081
Sit down, Joe.

58:36.280 --> 58:38.567
Sure I'm good enough to sit
in such a swell chair?

58:38.720 --> 58:40.961
Come on, now. Cut the comedy.
Sit down.

58:44.920 --> 58:46.604
Screw, Otero.

58:46.760 --> 58:49.491
- I want to talk with Joe private.
- Sure.

58:49.640 --> 58:51.483
See you later, Joe.

58:52.320 --> 58:54.891
- Cigar, Joe?
- No, thanks.

58:55.960 --> 58:59.282
Well, will you have a cocktail
or a dash of brandy?

58:59.440 --> 59:00.771
No.

59:01.280 --> 59:04.284
Well, it surprise you to hear from me?

59:04.440 --> 59:05.965
Kind of.

59:06.240 --> 59:09.687
I thought it would be kind of nice
to have a little talk together...

59:09.920 --> 59:11.365
...like old times.

59:11.720 --> 59:13.643
Certainly is nice to see you, Rico.

59:13.800 --> 59:15.529
Especially like this.

59:15.680 --> 59:19.002
- You're looking good.
- You're looking good too, Joe.

59:19.200 --> 59:21.202
Living easy, kind of, huh?

59:21.360 --> 59:25.410
- Not that easy. Dancing's no cinch.
- Yeah, but you ain't complaining.

59:26.800 --> 59:30.691
- No. No, I ain't complaining.
- That's good.

59:32.040 --> 59:33.451
Yeah.

59:33.600 --> 59:35.921
Dancing's all right for a sideline.

59:36.080 --> 59:38.287
It gives you a swell front.

59:38.440 --> 59:40.283
But it ain't my idea of a man's game.

59:41.560 --> 59:42.971
What's the difference, Rico?

59:43.800 --> 59:46.007
As long as I ain't kicking,
why should you kick?

59:46.160 --> 59:47.400
Who's kicking?

59:48.960 --> 59:52.521
Only why should a young guy
like you be wasting his time?

59:54.400 --> 59:57.643
And I kind of took pride in you, Joe...

59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.207
...brought you into the gang,
pushed you ahead.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.249
But now you're getting to be a sissy.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.210
We got to go into that again?
Can't you just forget about me?

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.331
I don't want to forget, Joe. You're my pal.
We started off together, didn't we?

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.608
We've got to keep going along together.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.683
Who else do I got to give a hang about?

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.325
I need you, Joe.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.289
I've got the biggest chance of my life.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.011
The Big Boyjust handed me
the whole North Side...

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:25.449
...but it's too much for one man to handle
alone. I need somebody, a guy like you...

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.086
- ... somebody I can trust.
- Can't be me, Rico.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.924
I've quit.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.204
You didn't quit.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.323
Nobody ever quit me.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.369
You're still in my gang, you got that?

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.000
I don't care how many fancy skirts
you've got hanging on to you.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:44.004
That jane's made a softy out of you.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.885
- You lay off Olga.
- I ain't laying off. I'm after her!

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.687
One of us has to lose, and it won't be me.
There's ways of stopping that dame.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.123
- You're crazy. Leave her out of this!
- She's through, out of the way.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.567
- You're lying. You wouldn't dare!
- I wouldn't?

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.927
- I'll show you!
- Rico, listen.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.765
We're in love with one another.
Don't that mean nothing?

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.490
Nothing. Less than nothing.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.331
Love. Soft stuff!

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:09.006
When she's got you,
you ain't no good for anything.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.446
We ain't out of this yet...

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.001
...and we don't want no softies
spilling things!

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.447
I won't spill anything,
if you're scared of that.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.444
- You think I want my neck stretched?
- Well, you know too much.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:22.321
I ain't gonna take any chances.
You're hanging around with me, see?

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.448
No, I'm not.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.890
All right.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.443
You go back to that dame...

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.523
...and it's suicide.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.330
Suicide for both of you.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.089
Just stick here.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.800
Hello?

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.122
Oh, hello, Big Boy.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.650
No. No, I don't want that guy.
I don't trust him.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.681
Yeah. I got a kid by the name
of Joe Massara who'll help me.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.488
Yeah. All right, goodbye, Big Boy.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.369
Oh, Joe...

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.844
- Joe.
- Olga.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.446
- We've gotta go. Hurry!
- Joe, what's the matter?

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.887
Didn't you hear what I said?
Hurry! Hurry!

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.566
- Yes, Joe. Oh, you're ill.
- I'm all right.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.007
- Rico.
- What did he do to you?

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.486
Oh, didn't I know it?

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.405
He, Rico-
He said you and me got to quit.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.211
He'd kill you unless I stuck with him.
I ran away.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:59.410
We've got to get out of here.
Anywhere. As long as we get away!

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.210
No.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.490
- No? You're not coming?
- No.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.920
That's not the way.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.082
But, Olga, you don't know that guy!

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.368
- Olga, you've got to! Please!
- No.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.971
Sit down, Joe.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.841
- We've got to think.
- I don't want to think or sit down.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.571
- You're coming.
- Don't you see? It would be no use!

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.127
Where? Where would we go?
Where would we run to?

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.561
There's no place he wouldn't find us.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.330
There's only one thing for us to do.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.051
Flaherty

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.722
You're crazy.
You think that would save us?

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.770
Flaherty? That's worse than suicide

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.804
- I won't do it. I can't.
- Well, I can do it.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.241
That gang must go. Rico must go.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.243
I want my happiness, Joe. I want you.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.563
We'll never have peace till Rico's gone.
I'm going to do it.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.728
Olga, don't! Please! Stay here!

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.440
Olga, open this door!

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.210
Olga, open this door! Hurry!

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.407
Park, 1000.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.762
Olga. Don't call Flaherty.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.810
Please open this door, quickly!
Rico will kill us both!

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.611
Headquarters, I want Sergeant Flaherty.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.729
Sergeant Flaherty, this is Olga Stassoff.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.281
I've got Joe Massara with me.
In my apartment.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.408
17 Edsel Drive.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.609
Yes. Yes, he wants to talk to you.
Hurry, hurry!

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.161
Come on, boys,
we're going to a party.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.600
Who's giving the party?

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.001
- Joe Massara.
- Formal or informal?

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.642
I don't know, but we'll find out
when we get there.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.008
You shouldn't have done it.
You shouldn't have.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.243
There was no other way.
No other right way.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.809
- It's the rope for me.
- No, it isn't.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.644
Not if you turn state's evidence.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.962
We'll make them promise
everything will be okay.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.170
Wait, Olga!

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.401
Joe!

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.324
There he is, the dirty double-crosser.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.244
Give it to him, Rico!

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.290
No.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.845
Shoot.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.004
Shoot, Rico.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.363
Get it over with.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.363
Come on, Otero! Let's go!

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:51.885
You're getting soft too.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.563
What's the matter with you? Come on!

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:02.846
Joe.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.486
- Who was it?
- Otero! He and Rico. Through the window!

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.449
Go on, boys. Go and get him!

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.291
Are you ready to talk now, Joe?

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.603
Well, I'll talk. It was Rico's gang
that held up the Bronze Peacock.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.325
It was Rico who shot McClure.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.404
That dirty, low, sneaking-
Well, Joe will tell you. Ask him.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.648
He knows it was Rico.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.570
Is that right, Joe?

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.087
Was it Rico?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.287
- Where's your phone?
- In there.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.764
Oh, Joe. Here, let me help you.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.049
Park, 1000.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:04.082
Hello, Dan, this is Flaherty.

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.765
Round up that Palermo gang.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.048
I got enough on them to use
a mile of rope.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.966
Shoot the cars right out,
and above all, get Rico.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.685
We've gotta watch our step.
The cops are sure to be cruising around.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:30.525
- You should have plugged Joe.
- And the dame.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.490
If they ain't squealed about McClure yet,
they'll do it now.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.051
- From now on, we're hot.
- Yeah.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.441
This is what I get
for liking a guy too much.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.806
Come on.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.766
Halt!

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.325
Halt!

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.967
Go on, Rico.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.009
I'm done for.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.525
Go on, Rico.

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:34.051
Sam! Sam!

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.647
Joe Massara! They nabbed him over
the McClure business, and he squawked.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:41.609
Rico tried to get him.
Now they're after him. They got Otero.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.928
Otero?
- Sam, don't you get me?

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.685
- What are you sitting there for?
- What else can I do?

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.729
I can't run now.
They'd get me anyhow.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.770
You're out of your head.
Come on, get up. Let's beat it!

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.251
It's no use.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.362
Put them up! Don't move!
Hand over your guns.

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.046
All right. Take them down to the car.

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:17.084
You'd better give up, Sam.

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:20.682
Drop that gun before we start shooting.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.729
Come on in.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.810
Get on your feet and put your hands up.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.082
Put the cuffs on him.

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:41.283
You ain't got nothing on me.

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:43.807
Nothing but the bracelets.

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:48.006
And we haven't
got a thing on Rico, either.

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:50.562
He's next.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.763
- There's nobody in there.
- No?

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:05.091
Well, listen, Ma. If you see Rico,
you'd better let us know, quick.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.086
Well...

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.248
...you got yourself in a nice fix.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.129
- Yeah.
- The cops were just here.

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:48.166
- They got Otero.
Uh-huh.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:52.363
Ma, I'm gonna stay here
a day or two, then I want a car.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:56.042
Gonna cost you big,
because I'm taking big chances.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.851
I got 10 grand planted here.
Help yourself.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.401
When you're ready to start,
I'll give you $150.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.170
You'll give me?

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.886
Whose money is this?
Who do you think you're talking to?

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.568
I need plenty. My money is hidden
in the apartment. I can't get to it.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.963
I'll give you $150. Take it or leave it.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.845
Why, you dirty, thieving old hag, I'll-

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.530
No, you won't.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:22.127
Because I'm the only one knows
where the money's hid.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.529
Kill me, and you won't get a cent.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.045
I'll give you $150...

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.885
...if you'll be a good boy.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.962
He was mean, Sam Vettori was.

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.646
So now he's got
what was coming to him.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.370
What does it say in the paper?

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.049
"Former gang chief faints on scaffold.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.085
Hmph.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.760
After a futile battle in the courts...

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.606
...Sam Vettori, former gang leader...

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:35.246
...today presented a pitiful figure...

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.764
...as the hangman's noose
was placed around his neck. "

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.564
Listen. "Little Caesar
has never been found.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:52.601
According to the statement of Lieutenant
Thomas Flaherty of the homicide squad...

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.486
...Little Caesar, the once swaggering
braggart of the underworld...

01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:02.608
...wilted in the face of real danger
and showed the world his cowardice.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.170
Flaherty stated further that Little Caesar
has contradicted his oft-repeated boast...

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.601
...that he could dish it out
and take it too. "

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:11.966
Yeah.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.282
"When a real crisis arose...

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.881
...Rico couldn't take it.

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:20.243
Flaherty ended his interview
by remarking:

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:24.769
'Meteoric as was Rico's rise
from the gutter...

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.891
...it was inevitable
that he should return there. "'

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.087
Eh.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.211
Well, just the same,
he was the real leader of that gang.

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.567
Don't you believe it.

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.162
Rico didn't have the nerve,
and he didn't have the brains.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.322
He was yellow,
just like Flaherty said.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.525
Here!

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.444
- That's what Rico-
- Give me that paper!

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.045
Hey, watch it!

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:58.362
- What's the matter with him?
Must be crazy.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.568
I'll show them where they get off.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.763
Trying to put that kind of stuff
about me in the papers, huh?

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.809
I'll show them- Hello?

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.724
Hello? I want Park, 1000.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.168
Yeah. Yeah, I can't take it no more, huh?

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.006
I'll tell that guy where to-
Hello? Park, 1000?

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:34.006
- Get me Flaherty, and get him quick.
- Sure. Just a minute.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.401
Tom. Oh, Tom.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.527
I may be screwy,
but this sounds like Rico.

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:41.250
Yeah?

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.570
- Flaherty speaking.
- Yeah, this is Rico speaking!

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.961
Rico! R-I-C-O, Rico!
Little Caesar, that's who!

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.363
You're a big guy, ain't you?
Shooting your mouth off in the papers.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.808
So I ran out when it got hot, huh?
I can't take it no more?

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.088
Well, listen, you crummy,
flatfooted copper...

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.083
...I'll show you whether
I lost my nerve.

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.722
Thanks, Rico, old boy.
The same to you and many of them.

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.609
Come on, tell me some more.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.206
The sound of your voice
does my heart good.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.210
Trace that call. Find out
where he's phoning from, quick.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.766
Uh-huh.

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:19.402
Say, why didn't you come to Sam's
neck-stretching party, Rico?

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.403
It was a big success.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.923
Hm. Funny guy, ain't you, Flaherty?

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.248
Well, you ain't got much longer to laugh.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.971
I'm coming, and I'm gonna put one
in your dirty hide...

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.726
...for every lying crack
that you made about me, see?

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:35.571
I'll show you who's gonna
finish up in the gutter.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.849
We've missed you, Rico.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.287
The town has been nice and quiet.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.363
I'm putting on weight.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:46.844
River, 6547. It's a flophouse down
at 4th and Commercial.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.923
All right. All right, big mouth.

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.765
Get your hat and star': running,
see, because you're all through.

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:55.686
Call the papers and tell them that,
you rotten, dirty, lying copper!

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.080
Hm.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:01.408
I knew we'd hear from that guy
if I kept giving it to him in the papers.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.766
The conceit of that guy.

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:06.561
They'll have to build a special noose
to get that swelled head of his through.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.048
Well, wish me luck.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.680
There he is. That's Rico, all right.
Pull in there.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:57.371
You'd better give up, Rico.
You haven't got a chance.

01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.010
You'll have to come and get me.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.851
You'd better be a nice boy, Rico,
and come out.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.207
You heard me!
If you want me, come and get me!

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.408
I'll be with you in a minute.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.648
Give me that chopper.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.882
This is your last chance, Rico.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.520
Are you coming out,
or do you want to be carried out?

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:42.528
Well, Rico, it looks like you and I
are going to take that little ride together.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.570
No...

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.762
No, we ain't.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:53.568
I told you a little buzzard like you
will never put any cuffs on me.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.811
You should have come out
when I told you to, Rico.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.451
Mother of mercy.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.523
Is this the end of Rico?

01:18:09.305 --> 01:18:15.292
