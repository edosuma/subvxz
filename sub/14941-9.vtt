WEBVTT

00:01.132 --> 00:04.175
(Thunder rumbling)

00:12.713 --> 00:15.045
(Thunder crashes)

00:15.046 --> 00:17.418
(Velcro crackles)

00:22.193 --> 00:25.355
(Thunder rumbles)

00:25.356 --> 00:28.229
(Camera shutters click,
people speak indistinctly)

00:34.135 --> 00:37.137
Uh, Mr. Weaver, I apologize.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.669
I've had this conversation
more than once with Lacey.

00:39.670 --> 00:42.672
She knows she's not supposed
to use her cell phone in class.

00:42.673 --> 00:44.674
My real concern is
what she's using it for.

00:44.675 --> 00:47.547
I know these types of
web sites are out there,

00:47.548 --> 00:51.050
but a 12 year old looking at
paparazzi photos of a dead body?

00:51.051 --> 00:53.553
You see why I find that
disturbing. Actually, I don't.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.725
Death is a normal part of life.

00:55.726 --> 00:57.727
My ex-wife is a
medical examiner.

00:57.728 --> 00:59.689
Dead bodies are what she does.

00:59.690 --> 01:01.691
It's still inappropriate
material for school.

01:01.692 --> 01:03.693
(Lacey) Everybody's been
looking at these photos.

01:03.694 --> 01:05.695
The body... it's Nikki parkson.

01:05.696 --> 01:08.738
Parkson financial, parkson
library? (Todd) Yeah, their daughter.

01:08.739 --> 01:10.740
She used to be in,
like, a ton of magazines.

01:10.741 --> 01:12.372
She's really big

01:12.373 --> 01:14.374
into the environment
and the rain forests.

01:14.375 --> 01:17.107
She's really cool. She died?
Why didn't I know about this?

01:17.108 --> 01:19.109
She was sick or something.
Her funeral's today.

01:19.110 --> 01:21.281
Cell phones are here to
stay, but we do have rules.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.813
And as parents, I expect
you to help enforce them.

01:23.814 --> 01:25.815
I agree, Mr. Weaver.

01:25.816 --> 01:27.817
And we have wasted
enough of your time.

01:27.818 --> 01:30.520
I'm sure you have much more
important issues to deal with.

01:30.521 --> 01:33.463
Lacey's father and I will find
the appropriate punishment.

01:33.464 --> 01:36.196
So nice to meet you.
Well, I'm always available.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.728
Megan, what are you doing?

01:38.729 --> 01:41.131
Talk to you later, Lacey.

01:41.132 --> 01:43.603
This is Nikki parkson's
death certificate.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.276
Is that your signature
down at the bottom

01:46.277 --> 01:48.438
as the witnessing physician?
Obviously, you know it is.

01:48.439 --> 01:50.109
I'm just wondering

01:50.110 --> 01:52.542
why you didn't call
the medical examiner

01:52.543 --> 01:55.114
after Nikki's death.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.417
I treated Nikki for familial
paroxysmal polyserositis

01:57.418 --> 01:58.848
for over two years.

01:58.849 --> 02:02.692
She had severe renal
and cardiac amyloidosis.

02:02.693 --> 02:05.325
It was really just
a matter of time.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.558
Would you mind describing
for me how Nikki passed away?

02:08.559 --> 02:10.560
(Sighs) I got a call
from Lillian parkson

02:10.561 --> 02:11.861
night before last.

02:11.862 --> 02:14.834
I went to the house. Nikki
was supine in her bed.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.666
I checked her vitals.

02:16.667 --> 02:19.669
There were none. I pronounced
it. You shoulda called it in.

02:19.670 --> 02:21.671
The parksons have
suffered enough, Dr. Hunt.

02:21.672 --> 02:24.674
I did what I thought was best
for Nikki and for the family.

02:24.675 --> 02:26.346
Now if you don't mind,

02:26.347 --> 02:29.380
I really do have
better places to be.

02:32.323 --> 02:34.324
Looks like you
charmed another one.

02:34.325 --> 02:37.227
What was that all about?

02:37.228 --> 02:40.530
Nikki parkson died two days ago.

02:40.531 --> 02:42.532
He signed off
on her certificate.

02:42.533 --> 02:45.295
Yeah? So?

02:45.296 --> 02:48.167
Look at this...

02:48.168 --> 02:50.169
The trail of blood.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.841
The doctor just said

02:51.842 --> 02:55.475
Nikki was supine in
her bed on her back.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.208
The blood should've
run down her neck.

02:58.209 --> 02:59.949
That blood runs
forward toward her chin.

02:59.950 --> 03:03.883
So either gravity failed
or someone's lying.

03:03.884 --> 03:07.217
We need to stop that funeral.

03:07.218 --> 03:08.858
(Footsteps approach)

03:08.859 --> 03:10.520
(Megan) Curtis.

03:10.521 --> 03:12.222
Where's Kate?

03:12.223 --> 03:15.225
Do I have to remind you again
that I am not her assistant?

03:15.226 --> 03:18.197
You can try. I'm not sure it'll do
any good. Why do you need her?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.530
I'm about to dive into something
that could ruffle some feathers.

03:20.531 --> 03:22.232
Just checking in.

03:22.233 --> 03:23.703
Whoa. Stop the train.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.776
You gon' check in with the
chief beforeyou get in trouble?

03:26.777 --> 03:28.878
But since the
chief isn't here...

03:28.879 --> 03:31.581
You're gonna just dive right
on in anyway, aren't you?

03:31.582 --> 03:33.483
You're the deputy
medical examiner.

03:33.484 --> 03:36.816
You want to make the call? Me
approve one of your schemes? Oh, no.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.948
Mnh-mnh. This conversation
never even happened.

03:38.949 --> 03:40.921
Understand me?

03:46.957 --> 03:49.559
(Elevator bell dings)

03:49.560 --> 03:50.730
Hey.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.502
O-O-One question.

03:52.503 --> 03:56.235
Do you want to be involved
in Lacey's life or not?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.737
One asinine question.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.439
(Chuckles) You know I do.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.471
Okay, that back at
the school there...

04:01.472 --> 04:03.843
That's not involvement.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.845
That's the same kind of
work-comes-first attitude

04:05.846 --> 04:08.348
that got us here. I'm sorry. It
couldn't be helped. But there was

04:08.349 --> 04:11.351
no reason both of us had to stay
there. You can handle it. No, no, no.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.852
No, see, that's just it.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.855
I don't want to be the
bad cop all by myself.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.858
I know how that ends.
She turns 16, and then she...

04:18.859 --> 04:22.392
She wants to move in with her
mother. Maybe that's my plan.

04:22.393 --> 04:24.694
I did take her phone
away from her.

04:24.695 --> 04:27.697
All right. I will talk to
her. I will play bad cop.

04:27.698 --> 04:30.000
But right now, I gotta go.

04:32.643 --> 04:36.676
(Thunder rumbling)

04:36.677 --> 04:39.679
Don't you think we should
talk to the family first?

04:39.680 --> 04:43.012
The parksons are very
rich and wield a lot of power.

04:43.013 --> 04:45.715
Well, that's... that's kind
of what I'm talking about.

04:45.716 --> 04:47.717
If they're covering
something up,

04:47.718 --> 04:49.789
they'll only make things harder.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.962
Besides, I'm not here for them.

04:52.963 --> 04:55.024
I'm here for Nikki.

04:55.025 --> 04:59.829
(Woman speaks indistinctly)

04:59.830 --> 05:03.373
(Megan) You do nice
work. She looks beautiful.

05:03.374 --> 05:07.437
You know, the service
doesn't start for another hour.

05:07.438 --> 05:10.341
I'll go get my boss.

05:12.943 --> 05:14.944
(Peter) Young, wasn't she?

05:14.945 --> 05:17.947
22... Her whole
life ahead of her.

05:17.948 --> 05:20.750
All the blood's gone now.

05:20.751 --> 05:22.893
You see something?

05:27.398 --> 05:30.430
Give me a tissue, will you?

05:30.431 --> 05:33.564
(People speaking indistinctly)

05:36.066 --> 05:38.008
(Peter) A ligature Mark?

05:40.110 --> 05:42.912
So much for natural causes.

05:42.913 --> 05:45.074
What do you think you're
doing to my daughter?

05:45.075 --> 05:47.046
I am terribly sorry,
Mrs. Parkson.

05:47.047 --> 05:50.620
I know that this is a
difficult time for you,

05:50.621 --> 05:53.623
and I'm afraid I'm going
to make it a lot worse.

05:53.624 --> 05:56.826
You can't Bury Nikki today.

05:56.827 --> 05:58.127
(Fabric snaps)

05:58.128 --> 06:00.791
♪♪♪

06:07.968 --> 06:10.400
(Thunder rumbling)

06:10.401 --> 06:12.902
You two can't wait for
me to find the bodies.

06:12.903 --> 06:15.405
You gotta go finding 'em
on your own now, huh?

06:15.406 --> 06:17.407
You'll have to take
that up with Megan.

06:17.408 --> 06:19.749
(Chuckles) I'm guessing
Megan's got enough on her plate

06:19.750 --> 06:21.380
right now.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.382
Have you thought at all
about what you're doing

06:23.383 --> 06:25.685
to my family, Dr. Hunt? I
understand, Mrs. Parkson...

06:25.686 --> 06:28.057
300 mourners are due
here in less than an hour.

06:28.058 --> 06:29.889
Do you have any idea

06:29.890 --> 06:32.061
how embarrassing
this is going to be?

06:32.062 --> 06:34.063
This has to be
some kind of a joke.

06:34.064 --> 06:36.766
I'm sitting, writing a
eulogy for my sister,

06:36.767 --> 06:39.068
and I get a call that you're
seizing her body? I'm very sorry,

06:39.069 --> 06:41.400
but there is now a question about the cause
of death. I don't care what the excuse.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.033
My sister deserves better
than to be paraded out there

06:44.034 --> 06:46.175
for the cameras. Mr. Parkson,
Mrs. Parkson, I'm Dr. Murphy.

06:46.176 --> 06:47.977
I'm the chief medical examiner.
I assure you, we are doing

06:47.978 --> 06:51.040
everything possible to
protect Nikki and your family.

06:51.041 --> 06:53.883
Don't you want to know
the truth about your sister?

06:53.884 --> 06:56.486
You really think we don't
already know the truth?

06:56.487 --> 06:59.048
Nikki killed herself.

06:59.049 --> 07:01.120
And you thought
it would be all right

07:01.121 --> 07:03.953
to just cover up her suicide?

07:03.954 --> 07:05.955
To protect her
memory, her dignity.

07:05.956 --> 07:07.957
You've seen the press out there.

07:07.958 --> 07:09.999
You think they care
about my sister?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.001
We wanted to keep this private.

07:12.002 --> 07:13.663
Now, thanks to you,

07:13.664 --> 07:16.435
this is how she'll be
remembered, forever.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.068
(People speaking indistinctly)

07:19.069 --> 07:21.771
This is Dr. Megan hunt,

07:21.772 --> 07:25.515
performing the autopsy
of Nikki parkson.

07:25.516 --> 07:28.077
There is a linear Mark,

07:28.078 --> 07:31.050
2.5 centimeters in width,

07:31.051 --> 07:34.023
situated horizontally
on the upper neck.

07:34.024 --> 07:36.586
It extends obliquely upward

07:36.587 --> 07:38.157
and backward.

07:38.158 --> 07:43.232
Present within the Mark is
a pattern of a braided cord.

07:43.233 --> 07:45.535
An elliptical impression

07:45.536 --> 07:47.537
is present behind the left ear,

07:47.538 --> 07:51.100
bearing the same corded pattern.

07:51.101 --> 07:54.203
All indications...

07:54.204 --> 07:57.076
Consistent with a
suspended hanging.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.478
Well, you made the
headlines. You wanna see?

07:59.479 --> 08:02.151
Not particularly. Oh.

08:02.152 --> 08:04.714
Lacey looked up to this girl.

08:04.715 --> 08:07.216
Well, that's not a
bad role model...

08:07.217 --> 08:09.088
The Franklin school, Princeton,

08:09.089 --> 08:12.091
always top of her class,
tons of charity work,

08:12.092 --> 08:15.064
and... and uniquely
enough in this day and age,

08:15.065 --> 08:18.227
no sex tape, no scandals.

08:18.228 --> 08:20.700
Seems like she was
something special.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.733
What do you know about
paroxysmal polyserositis?

08:23.734 --> 08:26.275
Uh, symptoms
include inflammation,

08:26.276 --> 08:29.278
repeated fevers,
uh, abdominal pain,

08:29.279 --> 08:32.942
chest pain, joint
pain, skin lesions...

08:32.943 --> 08:35.044
All treatable with colchicine,

08:35.045 --> 08:37.987
which, incidentally, is
derived from the crocus flower.

08:37.988 --> 08:40.550
Ethan, I am impressed.

08:40.551 --> 08:42.051
Thank you.

08:42.052 --> 08:43.593
I'm on the Internet.

08:43.594 --> 08:45.995
(Chuckles)

08:45.996 --> 08:48.728
But you're right.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.730
(Megan) She really
was something special.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.263
(Mrs. Parkson) Please sit down?

08:58.168 --> 09:00.640
Nikki knew she was dying.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.642
Her heart and
kidneys were going.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.774
That's how it finally gets you.

09:04.775 --> 09:06.646
And she was taking colchicine?

09:06.647 --> 09:09.619
Every day. It just
wasn't very effective.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.220
Nikki got depressed
and discouraged.

09:11.221 --> 09:13.983
She had seen her
father waste away

09:13.984 --> 09:15.985
from the same disease.

09:15.986 --> 09:18.788
She always said she
didn't want to die like that.

09:18.789 --> 09:20.760
And before you
go digging him up,

09:20.761 --> 09:23.933
uh, he died in a hospital
surrounded by doctors

09:23.934 --> 09:25.795
almost five years ago.

09:25.796 --> 09:28.267
Who actually found Nikki?

09:28.268 --> 09:31.170
I did.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.673
It was around 11:00.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.675
My mother went
up to check on Nikki.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.778
I heard her scream,
I... ran upstairs to see,

09:38.779 --> 09:43.082
and... I saw Nikki
hanging there.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.084
I thought maybe
I could save her.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.156
I tr...

09:47.157 --> 09:49.989
Uh, she was beyond saving.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.191
Whose idea was it to
cover up the suicide?

09:52.192 --> 09:55.094
Mine, and I'd do it again.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.966
Nikki spent her life

09:56.967 --> 09:59.128
doing things to
help other people.

09:59.129 --> 10:02.131
That's how I wanted her to
be remembered. Not like this.

10:02.132 --> 10:04.603
So I cut her down, I
put her in her own bed,

10:04.604 --> 10:06.605
and called the doctor.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.238
(Voice breaking) I just... I
can't believe she's gone.

10:09.239 --> 10:12.141
I spent every day
of the last two years

10:12.142 --> 10:14.113
caring for Nikki.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.947
I-I gave up everything
to be at her bedside.

10:17.948 --> 10:19.118
(Sobs)

10:19.119 --> 10:21.691
I-I-I don't know what I'll...

10:21.692 --> 10:23.693
What I'll do now. (Sniffles)

10:23.694 --> 10:26.696
(Kate) I really am sorry for your
loss, Mrs. Parkson. Thank you.

10:26.697 --> 10:29.098
(Sam) I'm sorry, Mrs.
Parkson, but we need...

10:29.099 --> 10:30.399
Hi.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.402
I didn't know there was
someone else in the house.

10:33.403 --> 10:35.104
Doesn't surprise me.

10:35.105 --> 10:37.066
I'm the one they
don't talk about here.

10:37.067 --> 10:39.669
I'm Sara. Nikki's sister.

10:39.670 --> 10:41.671
Peter dunlop. I'm
with the m.E.'S office.

10:41.672 --> 10:44.113
Uh, suppose I could
see Nikki's room?

10:44.114 --> 10:45.815
Sure.

10:45.816 --> 10:47.817
So you live here as well?

10:47.818 --> 10:51.220
Me? (Chuckles) No. I escaped
this house five years ago.

10:51.221 --> 10:53.222
This is my first time back,

10:53.223 --> 10:55.725
and as soon as the funeral's
over, I'll be gone again.

10:55.726 --> 10:57.186
Troubles with your mother?

10:57.187 --> 10:59.889
I saw the way you
looked at her in the hall.

10:59.890 --> 11:01.961
I must seem like
a total bitch, huh?

11:01.962 --> 11:04.964
It's just, with Lillian,
everything's about Lillian.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.166
You heard her,
howshelost everything,

11:07.167 --> 11:10.039
what'sshegonna do now.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.041
You said that you
left five years ago.

11:12.042 --> 11:15.044
That was the same time your
father died. Once he was gone,

11:15.045 --> 11:17.707
there was no buffer
between me and my mom.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.178
So you left.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.211
I was thrown out, actually.

11:22.212 --> 11:25.715
I got caught with some
coke, embarrassed my mother,

11:25.716 --> 11:27.787
which was the real crime,

11:27.788 --> 11:30.790
so she threw me out
and cut me off entirely.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.722
That must have been rough.

11:32.723 --> 11:35.965
(Chuckles) Best thing
that ever happened to me.

11:35.966 --> 11:37.797
Hmm.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.801
Um...

11:42.833 --> 11:45.435
Nikki's room.

12:04.094 --> 12:06.425
That's what she used.

12:06.426 --> 12:10.230
She tied a piece of it
on the beam in there.

12:11.401 --> 12:14.203
Nikki was amazing.

12:14.204 --> 12:17.106
The best of the
three of us, by far.

12:17.107 --> 12:19.108
The only regret I
had about leaving

12:19.109 --> 12:22.111
was that I couldn't take her
with me. Did you keep in touch?

12:22.112 --> 12:25.945
I tried. We e-mailed, talked
on the phone sometimes.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.416
The last few weeks,

12:27.417 --> 12:29.849
she was sounding really
depressed, despondent.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.851
That's why I came
back from London.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.854
I was hoping I
could cheer her up.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.156
(Voice breaks) I thought I had.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.929
(Inhales deeply)

12:39.930 --> 12:41.130
Oh.

12:41.131 --> 12:45.394
(People speaking indistinctly)

12:45.395 --> 12:47.266
We're back.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.138
Just finishing up the neck.

12:49.139 --> 12:51.140
We brought you a present.

12:51.141 --> 12:53.202
Is it eggplant parm
from remmy's?

12:53.203 --> 12:55.174
Not exactly. We pulled
this from the trash.

12:55.175 --> 12:58.808
Oh, I'll pull the
skin flap down.

12:58.809 --> 13:00.881
We can make a comparison.

13:05.515 --> 13:08.257
Well, it looks like
a perfect match.

13:08.258 --> 13:10.559
I've got a lot of e-mails
from Nikki to her sister.

13:10.560 --> 13:13.092
There was no mention of suicide,

13:13.093 --> 13:16.095
but the girl was clearly depressed. Yeah,
family interviews also support suicide.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.928
I'm ready to sign
off on state of mind

13:18.929 --> 13:22.101
as soon as you're ready
with the body. Just about.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.273
Hold on a second.

13:24.274 --> 13:26.435
There is bruising...

13:26.436 --> 13:28.107
On the strap muscles.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.209
Bruising, from the rope?

13:30.210 --> 13:32.541
Below the rope.

13:32.542 --> 13:34.113
No question.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.115
Then what bruised 'em?

13:36.116 --> 13:38.187
Hands around her neck.

13:38.188 --> 13:41.190
The hanging was only meant
to make it look like a suicide.

13:41.191 --> 13:43.323
Nikki parkson was murdered.

13:58.108 --> 14:00.569
What the hell is all this?

14:00.570 --> 14:02.571
We have a warrant, Mr. Parkson.

14:02.572 --> 14:06.145
Nikki's bedroom is now a
crime scene. A crime scene?

14:06.146 --> 14:09.218
Your sister didn't commit suicide.
She was murdered. This is crazy.

14:09.219 --> 14:11.220
Have you completely
lost your minds?

14:11.221 --> 14:13.983
Nikki was sick.
She killed herself.

14:13.984 --> 14:16.585
No, this is insane.
You're not going in there.

14:16.586 --> 14:18.588
Well, I can arrest
you if you'd like.

14:22.893 --> 14:24.193
This is pointless.

14:24.194 --> 14:26.195
I mean, how am I supposed
to gather evidence?

14:26.196 --> 14:28.297
She's been embalmed. (Scoffs)

14:28.298 --> 14:30.299
I don't even have the
clothes she was wearing.

14:30.300 --> 14:33.002
You know, she's had a manicure, for
Pete's sake. When you're done with that,

14:33.003 --> 14:35.004
I need a revised
death certificate.

14:35.005 --> 14:37.176
Cause of death...
Manual strangulation.

14:37.177 --> 14:40.209
Are you sure?

14:40.210 --> 14:42.181
I'm only asking just
because you just...

14:42.182 --> 14:44.183
You don't seem 100% sure.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.185
Yes, I'm sure. I just
don't understand it.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.187
I'm looking at her
heart and kidneys.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.189
There's advanced amyloidosis.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.061
She was already dying.

14:52.062 --> 14:54.423
Why would somebody
want to murder her?

14:54.424 --> 14:56.295
A mercy killing maybe?

14:56.296 --> 14:58.968
Somebody couldn't
stand to watch her suffer.

14:58.969 --> 15:01.670
There's a lot more merciful
ways to end somebody's life.

15:01.671 --> 15:03.672
Well, I don't claim to
have all the answers.

15:03.673 --> 15:06.175
I just came in to tell
you your daughter called.

15:06.176 --> 15:08.207
She's on her way
over to see you.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.980
Oh, she must be going
crazy without her phone.

15:10.981 --> 15:14.113
(Gloves snap) A little
young to have gout, isn't she?

15:14.114 --> 15:16.115
She had beta thalassemia minor,

15:16.116 --> 15:19.248
so age is not a factor.

15:19.249 --> 15:22.452
Prep that. Get it on a slide.

15:25.295 --> 15:27.326
Wait. You think she meant me?

15:27.327 --> 15:29.328
You think she didn't mean you?

15:29.329 --> 15:31.160
(Laughs)

15:31.161 --> 15:34.433
(Police radio chatter)

15:34.434 --> 15:37.236
(Camera shutter clicks)

15:37.237 --> 15:38.537
(Indistinct conversations)

15:38.538 --> 15:41.070
All right, so let's
say you're the killer.

15:41.071 --> 15:44.443
Nikki's in bed or she's
in the chair reading.

15:44.444 --> 15:48.077
One way or another, my
hands end up around her throat,

15:48.078 --> 15:49.718
and I strangle her,

15:49.719 --> 15:53.322
then I grab a piece of cord from the
curtain. All right, question is, though,

15:53.323 --> 15:55.624
do you tie it around
the beam first...

15:55.625 --> 15:58.627
Or do you put it around
her neck and hoist her up?

15:58.628 --> 16:00.329
Well, if I want

16:00.330 --> 16:03.032
to make it look
like a true suicide...

16:03.033 --> 16:06.335
I'd have to go with the
tying over the beam first.

16:06.336 --> 16:09.038
(Camera shutter clicks)

16:09.039 --> 16:11.640
And then I make a noose...

16:11.641 --> 16:13.972
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

16:13.973 --> 16:16.245
And lift Nikki up into it.

16:16.246 --> 16:18.547
Suicide. Who else
had access to the room

16:18.548 --> 16:21.550
apart from the family and the
doctor? No one was here that night.

16:21.551 --> 16:24.713
The help was all gone by
7:00. Yeah, that's the "who."

16:24.714 --> 16:27.616
The other big
question is the "why."

16:27.617 --> 16:29.688
That's easy.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.690
Rich people like this?

16:31.691 --> 16:33.993
It's always about money.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.698
(Sighs)

16:39.699 --> 16:42.431
Okay, this is new
territory for both of us,

16:42.432 --> 16:44.433
so bear with me.

16:44.434 --> 16:47.005
Can't we just tell
dad you yelled at me?

16:47.006 --> 16:49.007
No. And I'm not
gonna yell at you.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.010
You just need to understand
that what you did was wrong.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.244
And your father and
I both agree on that.

16:55.245 --> 16:56.685
What's so funny?

16:56.686 --> 16:59.388
I'm sorry, it's just this whole
tag-team parenting thing,

16:59.389 --> 17:02.251
you guys both
being at my school.

17:02.252 --> 17:05.724
Why do you guys think you have to keep it a
secret? What do you mean, a secret? What?

17:05.725 --> 17:09.159
You and dad...
Getting back together.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.202
Uh... (Chuckles)

17:13.203 --> 17:15.204
Where did you get that idea?

17:15.205 --> 17:17.606
Please. Dad's been out,
like, almost every night,

17:17.607 --> 17:19.608
and the caller I.D. At home

17:19.609 --> 17:22.141
has logged a ton of
calls from your office.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.144
It doesn't take a genius.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.817
Okay. I think we're done here.

17:28.818 --> 17:31.320
Mom... are you okay?

17:31.321 --> 17:33.322
I am sorry to
disappoint you, Lacey,

17:33.323 --> 17:37.357
but your father and I
arenotgetting back together.

17:40.130 --> 17:41.430
(Elevator bell dings)

17:41.431 --> 17:43.432
Here's your phone.
I'll talk to you soon.

17:43.433 --> 17:45.664
(Kisses) I love you. Mwah.

17:45.665 --> 17:49.067
Go.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.269
Bye.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.301
(Giggles)

17:52.302 --> 17:54.573
(Sighs)

17:54.574 --> 17:57.846
Todd. Just had a
nice talk with Lacey.

17:57.847 --> 18:01.280
You need to call me... Soon.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.611
(Sighs)

18:02.612 --> 18:05.514
Bastard.

18:05.515 --> 18:08.257
(Buzzes)

18:08.258 --> 18:09.758
Oh, god. (Sighs)

18:09.759 --> 18:12.761
You know, it's ridiculous we
gotta sneak around like this.

18:12.762 --> 18:14.863
(Car horn honks)

18:14.864 --> 18:17.766
We're both adults... single.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.428
Uh, I'm not the only one

18:19.429 --> 18:21.770
who wanted to keep
things quiet, you know.

18:21.771 --> 18:25.534
No, I know. I wasn't...
Didn't mean it like that.

18:25.535 --> 18:27.236
(Truck horn honks)

18:27.237 --> 18:28.438
Ah.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.211
I just... i...

18:32.212 --> 18:34.213
It shouldn't feel sleazy,

18:34.214 --> 18:36.515
and it still kinda does.

18:36.516 --> 18:39.248
Well, maybe it's time to
get this out in the open.

18:39.249 --> 18:40.220
(Groans)

18:40.221 --> 18:41.290
(Chuckles)

18:41.291 --> 18:43.322
It'll have to happen sometime,

18:43.323 --> 18:44.893
assuming we keep...

18:44.894 --> 18:47.456
Doing whatever this
is that we're doing.

18:47.457 --> 18:49.528
But, um...

18:49.529 --> 18:51.800
This was nice.

18:51.801 --> 18:53.802
Hmm.

18:53.803 --> 18:57.236
And I didn't think
it was sleazy.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.407
Really?

18:58.408 --> 19:00.339
Sexy, definitely.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.612
But not sleazy.

19:03.613 --> 19:05.314
Mm. Wow.

19:05.315 --> 19:06.775
(Laughs) Mm.

19:06.776 --> 19:08.747
(Peter) You're not
gonna believe this,

19:08.748 --> 19:11.250
but Sam's crime tech's
found semen on Nikki's sheets.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.552
They're running the
d.N.A. Right now.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.224
Why wouldn't I believe

19:15.225 --> 19:17.786
a beautiful young
woman was having sex?

19:17.787 --> 19:19.288
Well, it's just, I mean,

19:19.289 --> 19:21.790
was sex even a
possibility in her condition?

19:21.791 --> 19:23.932
She was weak, but not that weak.

19:23.933 --> 19:26.365
Okay.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.767
(Sighs) I have what you wanted.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.269
What did I want?

19:30.270 --> 19:32.901
I made up a slide of
what Curtis thought

19:32.902 --> 19:35.304
might be gout in
Nikki parkson's toe.

19:35.305 --> 19:36.945
Turns out he was right.

19:36.946 --> 19:39.278
That doesn't make
sense. Why not?

19:39.279 --> 19:40.479
Ethan.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.711
I know I should know, because...

19:42.712 --> 19:45.884
Nikki was on colchicine. And
colchicine is used to treat gout.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.387
There is no way she could
develop a gout flare like that.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.959
Are we sure she
was on colchicine?

19:50.960 --> 19:53.322
According to her medical
records, 3 milligrams a day.

19:53.323 --> 19:54.923
(Sighs)

19:54.924 --> 19:57.396
We do have her pill dispenser.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.269
Get it.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.903
You're gonna hate me.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.605
I already hate you, dryer.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.607
(Laughs) You say that,

20:08.608 --> 20:11.610
but every April when
you want your taxes done,

20:11.611 --> 20:13.912
you are loving me.

20:13.913 --> 20:17.316
What'd you dig up on
Nikki parkson's finances?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.318
Money is not your motive.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.320
The only real funds
that she controlled

20:21.321 --> 20:23.752
are in the charitable trust...

20:23.753 --> 20:25.554
They have to be donated...

20:25.555 --> 20:27.826
To the rain forests,

20:27.827 --> 20:29.328
to be specific.

20:29.329 --> 20:33.262
So... unless you're an
endangered tree frog

20:33.263 --> 20:35.604
or a golden tamarin...

20:35.605 --> 20:38.837
Nobody profits from her death.

20:38.838 --> 20:42.411
Keep digging on it, will you?

20:42.412 --> 20:44.573
(Inhales deeply)

20:44.574 --> 20:47.276
(Cracks knuckles)

20:47.277 --> 20:49.578
(Ethan) Man, Nikki
took a lot of pills.

20:49.579 --> 20:51.580
(Peter) Which one
was colchicine?

20:51.581 --> 20:54.283
This one is supposed to be,

20:54.284 --> 20:56.586
but...

20:58.658 --> 21:00.689
(Gas hisses, switch clicks)

21:00.690 --> 21:03.463
You're gonna light it?

21:05.995 --> 21:08.368
(Crackles)

21:10.700 --> 21:13.271
(Hissing stops)

21:13.272 --> 21:15.704
(Crackles)

21:15.705 --> 21:17.846
It smells like crème brûlée.

21:17.847 --> 21:19.007
(Scoffs)

21:19.008 --> 21:20.809
(Sniffs)

21:20.810 --> 21:22.811
Actually, he's right.

21:22.812 --> 21:24.883
That's sugar.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.985
They're placebo pills.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.987
No wonder the
poor girl was dying.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.960
She wasn't getting her medicine.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.705
(Mr. Parkson) Mother,
what are you doing?

21:46.706 --> 21:48.306
What are they doing here?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.308
We have some questions
for your mother, Mr. Parkson.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.881
Well, she doesn't have
to answer them. I want to.

21:52.882 --> 21:54.383
The sooner this is done,

21:54.384 --> 21:56.385
the sooner we'll
have Nikki back.

21:56.386 --> 21:59.848
We need to have her funeral.

21:59.849 --> 22:02.491
So what can I
tell you, Dr. Hunt?

22:02.492 --> 22:05.554
Are you familiar with
Munchausen by proxy syndrome?

22:05.555 --> 22:07.556
I'm sure I've heard of it.

22:07.557 --> 22:09.558
I couldn't say
exactly what it is.

22:09.559 --> 22:12.060
In some cases, parents
actually make their children sick

22:12.061 --> 22:15.504
in order to get attention. You're
gonna say my mother gave Nikki f.P.P.?

22:15.505 --> 22:17.766
It's a genetic disease.
She was born with it.

22:17.767 --> 22:19.768
No, that's not what
I was going to say.

22:19.769 --> 22:21.470
Not exactly.

22:21.471 --> 22:23.472
But you did get
quite a lot of attention

22:23.473 --> 22:26.344
from your circle because
of Nikki's illness, didn't you?

22:26.345 --> 22:28.447
I'm blessed with
supportive friends

22:28.448 --> 22:32.781
if that's what you mean. (Sam) I
checked with the pharmacy, Mrs. Parkson.

22:32.782 --> 22:34.783
You personally signed
for Nikki's medication.

22:34.784 --> 22:36.925
So why didn't she
ever receive it?

22:36.926 --> 22:38.657
Oh, that's ridiculous.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.659
My mother was religious
about Nikki's medication.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.631
I saw her dole out
the pills every night.

22:42.632 --> 22:44.893
She gave her pills, yes,
but not the colchicine.

22:44.894 --> 22:48.136
They were sugar pills, placebos.

22:48.137 --> 22:50.769
How could you do that
to your own daughter?

22:50.770 --> 22:53.141
You don't understand.
Oh, I understand.

22:53.142 --> 22:57.145
As long as Nikki stayed
sick, you felt important.

22:57.146 --> 23:00.079
Mom, what are
they talking about?

23:01.851 --> 23:03.882
I'm putting an end to this. We're
done talking. What happened?

23:03.883 --> 23:06.154
Did Nikki find out?
Did she threaten to tell

23:06.155 --> 23:09.418
all your society friends what you did
to her? Did you hear me? We're done.

23:09.419 --> 23:12.891
Just imagine the embarrassment.
Is that why you killed her?

23:12.892 --> 23:15.494
Stop it! I want you out of here.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.696
Now. All right.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.529
We're leaving.

23:25.805 --> 23:28.407
Thank you for the tea.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.180
(Megan) Two years,

23:32.181 --> 23:34.182
that woman watched
this girl suffer...

23:34.183 --> 23:35.744
Her own daughter.

23:35.745 --> 23:37.746
If Nikki had gotten
her colchicine,

23:37.747 --> 23:39.518
the attacks could've
been prevented.

23:39.519 --> 23:42.050
She would've lived
a fairly normal life.

23:42.051 --> 23:44.152
Do you really think
her mother killed her?

23:44.153 --> 23:46.655
(Elevator bell dings) Believe
me. I've known women like Lillian.

23:46.656 --> 23:49.458
All they care
about is their image,

23:49.459 --> 23:51.500
more than anything else.

23:51.501 --> 23:53.462
It's possible.

23:53.463 --> 23:55.604
(Todd) Megan. What's going on?

23:55.605 --> 23:57.667
I just got your message.

24:00.209 --> 24:02.912
Let's go in my office.

24:08.518 --> 24:10.178
So what's so urgent?

24:10.179 --> 24:12.681
What happened with Lacey?

24:12.682 --> 24:16.656
Our daughter thinks
we're getting back together.

24:18.658 --> 24:21.159
Why in the world
would she think that?

24:21.160 --> 24:23.992
Maybe it has something
to do with the fact

24:23.993 --> 24:26.194
that you're screwing my boss.

24:26.195 --> 24:28.567
Oh, you're unbelievable.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.569
Unbelievable. Of all
the women in this city,

24:30.570 --> 24:32.070
you have to pick her?

24:32.071 --> 24:34.803
Kate was an expert witness
on one of my cases, and i...

24:34.804 --> 24:36.905
W-we just hit it off.
Oh, I'll just bet you did.

24:36.906 --> 24:39.147
It just happened. Lacey
doesn't know about this?

24:39.148 --> 24:41.780
No. So there haven't
been any sleepovers yet?

24:41.781 --> 24:44.152
Oh, jeez. Megan, come on. Don't start. When are
you planning on passing that little milestone?

24:44.153 --> 24:46.254
You are totally out of bounds
here. I'm out of bounds?!

24:46.255 --> 24:49.487
Yes, you are... you have put
me in an untenable position.

24:49.488 --> 24:53.261
We're all grown-ups here. We have done nothing wrong. You
don't see me sleeping with one of your partners, do you?

24:53.262 --> 24:55.163
Well, maybe you should.
It's been five years.

24:55.164 --> 24:58.226
You can't tell me you've
been a nun. (Scoffs)

24:58.227 --> 25:00.228
But you know, thank you, though.

25:00.229 --> 25:01.800
You know what?

25:01.801 --> 25:04.803
You did make me
realize one thing at least.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.735
It's time to tell Lacey.

25:06.736 --> 25:09.879
(Sighs)

25:17.547 --> 25:19.217
(Chair scrapes floor)

25:19.218 --> 25:21.720
We found your d.N.A.
On Nikki's bedsheets.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.151
No offense,

25:23.152 --> 25:25.854
but you're not exactly in
Nikki's league, are you?

25:25.855 --> 25:28.256
Auto theft, burglary... You
pled out to pot possession

25:28.257 --> 25:30.198
in Costa Rica a few months ago.

25:30.199 --> 25:31.900
Makes us think

25:31.901 --> 25:33.902
you might have
been up to no good.

25:33.903 --> 25:35.904
Maybe tried to take
advantage of Nikki's condition

25:35.905 --> 25:37.866
or even worse... rape.

25:37.867 --> 25:39.708
Rape?

25:39.709 --> 25:41.710
Nikki and I were in love.

25:41.711 --> 25:44.242
Did Nikki know
that? I'm serious.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.745
(Sighs) I delivered a
"get well" basket to her

25:46.746 --> 25:48.246
a couple of months ago.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.248
I-I had a copy of
"catcher in the rye"

25:50.249 --> 25:51.750
in my back pocket.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.752
Turns out, it was
her favorite book.

25:53.753 --> 25:56.224
I-I ended up staying for a
while and reading to her.

25:56.225 --> 25:59.187
We hit it off. Well, that's you
and Nikki sitting in the parlor.

25:59.188 --> 26:01.259
A long way from
messing up her sheets.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.932
I kept going back.

26:03.933 --> 26:06.995
Nikki was cool. We
liked the same stuff.

26:06.996 --> 26:09.297
And... and she didn't care
if I wasn't rich or anything.

26:09.298 --> 26:12.941
How did her family react to
you being around all the time?

26:12.942 --> 26:14.572
They didn't like it.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.605
Her mother tried to
bar me from the house.

26:16.606 --> 26:18.576
But that didn't stop you, right?

26:18.577 --> 26:21.249
I told you, me and Nikki
were in love. (Sam laughs)

26:21.250 --> 26:23.251
That's a beautiful story, Shane.

26:23.252 --> 26:26.114
But... I don't buy it.
Believe what you want.

26:26.115 --> 26:28.356
What I believe is,
you strangled Nikki

26:28.357 --> 26:32.060
and tried to make it look like a suicide.
No, no. No, no way. Never happened.

26:32.061 --> 26:36.324
You were in her room, and right after that,
she's dead. She was alive when I left. I swear.

26:36.325 --> 26:39.628
(Chuckles) Y-you don't believe
me? Ask the sister... Sara.

26:39.629 --> 26:42.772
She was there.
She walked in on us.

26:47.336 --> 26:50.038
It's true. I was out
for the evening.

26:50.039 --> 26:52.941
When I got back home,
I went up to Nikki's room.

26:52.942 --> 26:54.242
What time was that?

26:54.243 --> 26:56.915
I'm not sure. Close to 10:00?

26:56.916 --> 27:00.388
Anyway, when I got to
Nikki's door, it was closed.

27:00.389 --> 27:02.851
I didn't think for a minute
anything was going on,

27:02.852 --> 27:04.392
so I walked in.

27:04.393 --> 27:07.255
And Shane was there?

27:07.256 --> 27:09.357
At first, I was angry.

27:09.358 --> 27:13.101
But then I saw Nikki's
face. She looked so happy.

27:13.102 --> 27:15.333
What'd you do after that?

27:15.334 --> 27:17.335
I gave Shane a minute to dress,

27:17.336 --> 27:19.207
and then I walked
him out of the house.

27:19.208 --> 27:21.639
Why didn't you mention
him when we talked before?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.912
I threw him out. He
couldn't have done it.

27:23.913 --> 27:26.845
So you said that
happened around 10:00.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.247
What happened after that?

27:29.248 --> 27:32.180
I don't want to get
my brother in trouble.

27:32.181 --> 27:34.182
Sara, you need
to tell us the truth

27:34.183 --> 27:36.385
about what happened that night.

27:38.027 --> 27:40.789
Billy must have seen
me leading Shane out,

27:40.790 --> 27:42.791
because when I came back inside,

27:42.792 --> 27:44.262
he was upstairs.

27:44.263 --> 27:48.237
He was yelling at Nikki.
He sounded really pissed.

28:01.150 --> 28:03.151
We're not gonna get
anywhere near Billy now.

28:03.152 --> 28:04.813
He's totally lawyered up.

28:04.814 --> 28:06.284
Listen to this. (Scoffs)

28:06.285 --> 28:08.957
"The parksons have made
every effort to cooperate

28:08.958 --> 28:10.959
"but they no
longer see a benefit

28:10.960 --> 28:12.921
to continuing a dialogue."

28:12.922 --> 28:14.222
(Scoffs) They're hiding.

28:14.223 --> 28:16.925
The question is, which
one did it... Billy or Lillian?

28:16.926 --> 28:19.227
I mean, she had the motive...
Trying to protect her image.

28:19.228 --> 28:21.229
Yeah, but Billy
had a motive also.

28:21.230 --> 28:24.873
Last week, he inquired
about amending Nikki's trust.

28:24.874 --> 28:27.035
He wanted to change
her choice of charity.

28:27.036 --> 28:29.237
Where did Nikki want
her money to go to?

28:29.238 --> 28:31.239
An environmental fund. Uh...

28:31.240 --> 28:33.041
Rain forests?

28:33.042 --> 28:34.943
Something Lacey said.

28:34.944 --> 28:37.015
The point is, maybe
Billy couldn't stand

28:37.016 --> 28:39.317
to see all that money
going to frogs and trees.

28:39.318 --> 28:42.450
Might have led to a fight. Which means
that this could be about money after all.

28:42.451 --> 28:44.322
Either way, I need you two

28:44.323 --> 28:47.155
to help me link one
of them to this crime.

28:47.156 --> 28:50.028
(Megan) Oh, so much happened to
Nikki's body before we got it. Megan.

28:50.029 --> 28:53.031
Would you mind stepping into my
office for a minute, please? Can it wait?

28:53.032 --> 28:55.003
I just think that
we should talk.

28:55.004 --> 28:58.507
(Scoffs) Funny. You weren't
in any hurry to talk before.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.915
(Sighs)

29:21.931 --> 29:24.392
Funny thing... you always
go straight to the bodies.

29:24.393 --> 29:26.434
What are you talking about?

29:26.435 --> 29:28.436
Whenever something
is bothering you,

29:28.437 --> 29:31.269
this is where you're drawn
for solace, to the dead.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.302
Maybe because they don't
make annoying observations.

29:34.303 --> 29:36.444
(Chuckles)

29:36.445 --> 29:39.378
Okay. So you care to
share what's wrong?

29:42.411 --> 29:46.414
Kate is sleeping
with my ex-husband.

29:46.415 --> 29:48.316
And this bothers you?

29:48.317 --> 29:50.318
You need to ask?

29:50.319 --> 29:53.121
You and Todd have been
divorced for, like, five years.

29:53.122 --> 29:55.964
You... you'd have to figure he'd be
seeing somebody. Yeah, but Kate?

29:55.965 --> 29:59.397
What do you got against Kate?
She's screwing my ex-husband.

29:59.398 --> 30:02.871
(Chuckles) Unless you
still have feelings for him,

30:02.872 --> 30:05.134
I don't see the problem.

30:06.435 --> 30:08.206
Forget it.

30:08.207 --> 30:09.507
You see?

30:09.508 --> 30:12.941
You're doing it again...
The... the dead thing.

30:12.942 --> 30:15.414
(Sighs)

30:20.990 --> 30:23.291
You see something?

30:23.292 --> 30:26.294
Her manicure. It doesn't
match her pedicure.

30:26.295 --> 30:27.996
The color's
completely different.

30:27.997 --> 30:29.297
Okay. So?

30:29.298 --> 30:34.302
So the mortuary
didn't touch her toes.

30:34.303 --> 30:36.304
That makeup artist
was only worried about

30:36.305 --> 30:39.437
making her look pretty from
the waist up for the viewing.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.409
Ethan. Yeah.

30:41.410 --> 30:44.973
Did you scrape Nikki's toenails for evidence?
Uh, I t... i told you. It was pointless...

30:44.974 --> 30:46.915
(Sighs) You know?

30:46.916 --> 30:50.048
No, they were all clean, cut,
and painted for the funeral.

30:50.049 --> 30:52.380
Not her toenails.

30:52.381 --> 30:54.622
Uh...

30:54.623 --> 30:58.957
Look, I hate to be a downer,

30:58.958 --> 31:02.060
but Billy parkson's d.N.A. Is
not necessarily in the system,

31:02.061 --> 31:04.392
and there is no way
in hell that he's gonna

31:04.393 --> 31:07.395
give us a sample voluntarily. We
don't need Billy's d.N.A. We have Nikki's.

31:07.396 --> 31:10.399
We can do a sibling
comparison to get a match.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.544
Right away.

31:18.447 --> 31:19.949
(Clears throat)

31:21.550 --> 31:24.312
(Men shout indistinctly)

31:24.313 --> 31:27.315
Well, this is nice.
I've never been here.

31:27.316 --> 31:29.317
Thought you'd
like it. Thank you.

31:29.318 --> 31:32.260
You're welcome.

31:32.261 --> 31:35.223
(Sighs) I'm sorry
this has all...

31:35.224 --> 31:36.894
(Clears throat)

31:36.895 --> 31:38.626
Blown up... No.

31:38.627 --> 31:41.199
The way it has. There's
nothing to apologize for.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.500
I know.

31:42.501 --> 31:46.004
I just don't want it to
cause you any grief at work.

31:46.005 --> 31:48.006
You know what? We're all adults.

31:48.007 --> 31:50.308
It'll be fine. We'll
just soldier through.

31:50.309 --> 31:53.312
Just know, I may need
to call you for support.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.417
Have you talked to her yet?

31:59.418 --> 32:00.989
I approached it.

32:00.990 --> 32:03.121
But I didn't want to push.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.422
That's probably smart.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.554
Megan can be, uh,

32:06.555 --> 32:08.556
a little difficult
sometimes, to put it nicely.

32:08.557 --> 32:10.528
Okay, but let's not do that.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.601
Okay. Okay? I don't
want to talk about her

32:13.602 --> 32:15.533
like she's the enemy in this.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.535
Look, this is still so
new, you and me.

32:17.536 --> 32:20.108
So how about we just...

32:20.109 --> 32:22.110
Accept that it's gonna
be a little clumsy...

32:22.111 --> 32:23.411
(Laughs) At first,

32:23.412 --> 32:26.944
and, um... the rest,
we'll figure out as we go?

32:26.945 --> 32:28.416
(Inhales deeply)

32:28.417 --> 32:29.378
Right.

32:29.379 --> 32:31.579
At least we don't have
to hide it anymore.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.522
Yeah. Right?

32:38.587 --> 32:41.289
(People speaking indistinctly)

32:41.290 --> 32:44.392
(Footsteps approach)

32:44.393 --> 32:46.034
(Sighs) All right. I think...

32:46.035 --> 32:49.998
We just need to get this whole
thing out in the air. What thing?

32:49.999 --> 32:51.739
Todd and me dating.

32:51.740 --> 32:54.972
(Chuckles) You see
how easy that was?

32:54.973 --> 32:56.974
Why didn't you have the decency

32:56.975 --> 32:59.977
to come tell me that five weeks ago? Megan,
the only reason I didn't say anything

32:59.978 --> 33:02.050
about the relationship
before is because

33:02.051 --> 33:05.183
I don't even know yet
if it is a relationship.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.684
The bottom line is, I
don't want anything

33:06.685 --> 33:09.387
to affect our work here. (Chuckles)
Maybe you should've thought of that

33:09.388 --> 33:12.090
before you jumped into bed with
my husband. Your ex-husband,

33:12.091 --> 33:15.693
and we didn't jump into anything. You know,
I don't care anymore. Let's just move on.

33:15.694 --> 33:19.497
Yeah, I would love to move on, but
obviously... you know what I found? I...

33:19.498 --> 33:24.472
I just walked into the
middle of something, didn't I?

33:24.473 --> 33:27.305
Um, the d.N.A. Results came back

33:27.306 --> 33:31.109
from the tissue under,
uh, Nikki's toenail.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.381
The sibling
comparison is positive.

33:33.382 --> 33:35.343
So it is Billy's?

33:35.344 --> 33:38.046
No. It's a female sibling.

33:38.047 --> 33:40.789
The d.N.A. Is Sara's?

33:51.160 --> 33:52.460
Just got your message.

33:52.461 --> 33:54.432
So Sara parkson, huh? Yeah.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.564
Her tissue was deeply
embedded under Nikki's nail.

33:56.565 --> 33:59.237
It wasn't from any kind of
casual contact. It was violent.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.409
(Ethan) Okay. This is weird.

34:01.410 --> 34:02.710
Uh, bizarre, actually.

34:02.711 --> 34:05.413
I-I just... i just got
the full d.N.A. Report.

34:05.414 --> 34:07.075
Um, the lab found

34:07.076 --> 34:09.577
a second d.N.A.
Mixed in with Sara's,

34:09.578 --> 34:11.319
and it's not human.

34:11.320 --> 34:12.720
(Peter) Then what is it?

34:12.721 --> 34:14.682
Some sort of
organism? Uh, trypano...

34:14.683 --> 34:16.454
Uh, trypanoso...

34:16.455 --> 34:17.755
Trypanosoma cruzi?

34:17.756 --> 34:19.557
That's right.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.529
It's a parasite.

34:21.530 --> 34:23.761
Your girl was bit
by a kissing bug.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.763
So Sara has chagas disease.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.695
The parasite's in her blood.

34:27.696 --> 34:30.698
Bingo. It's pretty common
in certain parts of the world.

34:30.699 --> 34:32.700
The transmission
vector is an insect.

34:32.701 --> 34:35.173
Probably rhodnius prolixus
or rhodnius pallescens.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.644
Is chagas disease something

34:36.645 --> 34:38.806
that she could've picked
up in London? Not hardly.

34:38.807 --> 34:40.808
If the bug was r. Prolixus,

34:40.809 --> 34:42.810
we're talking about Guatemala
or Honduras probably.

34:42.811 --> 34:44.482
If it was r. Pallescens,

34:44.483 --> 34:46.654
then she spent some
time in Costa Rica.

34:46.655 --> 34:49.187
Our delivery boy Shane
was just in Costa Rica.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.658
Got back three months ago.

34:50.659 --> 34:53.090
A coincidence? (Peter)
They're in this together.

34:53.091 --> 34:56.194
They gotta be. But still, why kill
Nikki? We don't have a motive.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.196
Maybe we do.

34:58.197 --> 35:01.329
Nikki's charity was
rain forests, right?

35:01.330 --> 35:04.632
What do you want to bet it
was started in Costa Rica?

35:04.633 --> 35:07.635
(Sam) We made the
connection, Shane...

35:07.636 --> 35:09.807
You and Sara,

35:09.808 --> 35:11.509
Costa Rica.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.881
See, right now,

35:13.882 --> 35:18.746
Sara's family is getting
her a big, fancy lawyer.

35:18.747 --> 35:21.549
The lawyer's gonna
call his friend the judge,

35:21.550 --> 35:25.523
and the two of them are gonna
offer Sara a real sweet deal

35:25.524 --> 35:28.456
to lay this whole thing on you.

35:28.457 --> 35:30.428
You're done.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.800
And you're just gonna
sit there and take it.

35:32.801 --> 35:35.233
No.

35:35.234 --> 35:37.235
No way I'm taking the blame.

35:37.236 --> 35:38.806
It was her damn plan.

35:38.807 --> 35:42.210
(Sam) All right. So
walk me through it.

35:42.211 --> 35:45.473
I met Sara on a
beach in Costa Rica

35:45.474 --> 35:47.215
four months ago.

35:47.216 --> 35:50.218
She told me about her
rich little sister back home

35:50.219 --> 35:51.679
who was dying.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.681
Sara had a plan
to use the sister

35:53.682 --> 35:55.683
to get a share of
the family's money.

35:55.684 --> 35:57.685
She was pretty bitter
about scraping by

35:57.686 --> 35:59.887
when her family
had so much cash.

35:59.888 --> 36:02.430
And your job in this was what?

36:02.431 --> 36:05.593
Just to... Cozy up to Nikki.

36:05.594 --> 36:08.266
And convince her
to will her money over

36:08.267 --> 36:10.268
to the fake rain
forest foundation

36:10.269 --> 36:11.639
that Sara set up.

36:11.640 --> 36:15.503
Sara told me everything I
needed to know about Nikki...

36:15.504 --> 36:18.506
Her favorite books and foods,
the kind of music she liked,

36:18.507 --> 36:20.208
all that stuff...

36:20.209 --> 36:22.650
So getting in tight
with her was easy.

36:22.651 --> 36:26.214
And the environment
was already her thing, so...

36:26.215 --> 36:28.387
Piece of cake.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.659
I don't get it.

36:31.660 --> 36:34.892
All you had to do was sit
back and wait for Nikki to die.

36:34.893 --> 36:37.595
The money would've
gone straight to Sara.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.427
What happened?

36:39.428 --> 36:42.500
Nikki changed her mind.

36:42.501 --> 36:45.503
She wanted to switch charities.

36:45.504 --> 36:49.608
That's why Billy was looking
to reassign the beneficiary.

36:58.787 --> 37:00.788
I know why you killed her.

37:00.789 --> 37:02.520
You're wasting your time.

37:02.521 --> 37:05.222
You knew Nikki
better than anyone.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.626
You knew just how
to manipulate her.

37:08.627 --> 37:12.530
But she surprised
you, didn't she?

37:12.531 --> 37:14.362
She changed her mind,

37:14.363 --> 37:16.364
picked a new charity over yours.

37:16.365 --> 37:18.666
That's why you
came rushing home.

37:18.667 --> 37:21.839
Not to comfort her... Nikki,
for as long as I can remember...

37:21.840 --> 37:24.542
(Megan) To talk her out of it. You've
always cared about the rain forest.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.674
She wouldn't listen, would she?
This is just more important to me now.

37:26.675 --> 37:28.476
I don't know why that's
so hard to understand.

37:28.477 --> 37:34.482
So one night when you knew
that Shane would be there,

37:34.483 --> 37:37.485
you walked in on them.

37:37.486 --> 37:39.827
Sara, what are you
doing in here? Shut up.

37:39.828 --> 37:42.460
Maybe you gave
her a second chance.

37:42.461 --> 37:45.693
Or maybe you just
wanted to kill your sister.

37:45.694 --> 37:48.396
But even sick and dying,

37:48.397 --> 37:51.739
Nikki struggled to stay
alive. (Gasps and grunts)

37:51.740 --> 37:54.573
(Shane grunts) She
fought back. She kicked you.

37:57.576 --> 38:01.049
We have your d.N.A.
From under her toenail.

38:03.452 --> 38:07.556
You took a cord
from her window...

38:09.618 --> 38:12.460
Threw it over the rafter...

38:12.461 --> 38:15.463
And then made it look
like she hanged herself.

38:15.464 --> 38:17.064
Tell me...

38:17.065 --> 38:18.896
(Grunts)

38:18.897 --> 38:21.469
What's it like to
watch your sister die?

38:21.470 --> 38:23.471
(Thunder rumbling)

38:23.472 --> 38:27.835
It took you longer than
you expected, didn't it?

38:27.836 --> 38:29.977
Did her body convulse?
Did she struggle?

38:29.978 --> 38:33.341
It was... Just
supposed to be a con.

38:33.342 --> 38:35.483
But she had to ruin it.

38:35.484 --> 38:38.816
She was gonna give her money
to her disease, to research.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.488
She wanted to help people

38:40.489 --> 38:42.820
so they wouldn't have
to suffer like she did.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.394
People she didn't even
know. I'm her sister.

38:47.055 --> 38:50.428
Do you have any idea how
much money my family has?

38:50.429 --> 38:53.531
And they cut me off
like I never even existed.

38:53.532 --> 38:56.504
Besides...

38:56.505 --> 38:58.937
She was dying anyway.

39:05.374 --> 39:07.545
(Indistinct conversations)

39:07.546 --> 39:10.548
Déjà vu. We're back to
where we started from.

39:10.549 --> 39:14.021
No. Nikki got justice.

39:14.022 --> 39:16.584
She can rest in peace now.

39:16.585 --> 39:19.588
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

39:27.636 --> 39:30.398
You must think I'm a monster.

39:30.399 --> 39:31.839
You're right. I do.

39:31.840 --> 39:35.543
You have to know...

39:35.544 --> 39:37.505
I loved Nikki very much.

39:37.506 --> 39:40.007
I'd do anything I
could to have her back.

39:40.008 --> 39:42.550
Honestly, Mrs. Parkson,
I'm not interested.

39:42.551 --> 39:45.152
We're here for
Nikki, not for you.

39:45.153 --> 39:48.487
They, however, are here for you.

39:51.159 --> 39:54.562
What is this? (Sam chuckles)
You're under arrest, Mrs. Parkson,

39:54.563 --> 39:56.724
for interfering with your
daughter's medical care.

39:56.725 --> 39:59.497
Y-You're doing this here?

39:59.498 --> 40:01.729
Now?

40:01.730 --> 40:03.501
You have no proof.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.833
(Billy) Yes, they do, mom.

40:05.834 --> 40:08.436
I found Nikki's medicine...

40:08.437 --> 40:10.608
All the pills you
never gave her.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.540
You did this to me?

40:12.541 --> 40:14.612
What about our family?

40:14.613 --> 40:16.644
When have we ever been a family?

40:16.645 --> 40:17.945
(Police radio chatter)

40:17.946 --> 40:19.647
(Man) This way.

40:19.648 --> 40:22.721
(People speaking indistinctly)

40:32.130 --> 40:34.161
So you know,

40:34.162 --> 40:37.434
Nikki's money is gonna
go to help fight her disease,

40:37.435 --> 40:39.537
just as she wanted.

40:39.538 --> 40:42.670
That's what she'll
be remembered for.

40:42.671 --> 40:45.042
Thank you, Dr. Hunt.

40:45.043 --> 40:48.176
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

41:05.934 --> 41:08.937
(Indistinct conversations)

41:15.544 --> 41:17.044
Mom?

41:17.045 --> 41:18.646
(Laughs)

41:18.647 --> 41:23.480
I noticed that your other
cover was pretty beat up.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.684
Aren't you supposed to be
punishing me or something?

41:26.685 --> 41:28.856
I mean, we're at my
favorite restaurant,

41:28.857 --> 41:30.858
and you got me a gift.

41:30.859 --> 41:32.860
It's a thank-you.
If it wasn't for you,

41:32.861 --> 41:35.863
we would never have found
out the truth about Nikki parkson.

41:35.864 --> 41:38.527
I guess that's kinda true, huh?

41:40.569 --> 41:42.730
I know that your father

41:42.731 --> 41:44.772
talked to you about Dr. Murphy.

41:44.773 --> 41:46.504
Yeah.

41:49.207 --> 41:51.208
We're not getting back together.

41:51.209 --> 41:54.542
I don't know if you'd gotten
your hopes up about that.

41:54.543 --> 41:56.585
I'm fine.

41:58.286 --> 42:00.888
How are you, though?

42:00.889 --> 42:03.050
I mean, dad's dating your boss.

42:03.051 --> 42:06.554
I'd be going crazy right now.

42:06.555 --> 42:08.626
Thank you.

42:08.627 --> 42:10.928
You are the first person

42:10.929 --> 42:12.960
to acknowledge how hard this is.

42:12.961 --> 42:14.802
(Laughs)

42:14.803 --> 42:17.164
I promise I'll hate her.

42:17.165 --> 42:19.166
No, no. That won't help anyone.

42:19.167 --> 42:21.168
Just promise that
you'll respect her

42:21.169 --> 42:24.712
and... (Sighs)

42:24.713 --> 42:27.214
Give her the
benefit of the doubt

42:27.215 --> 42:28.876
once in a while.

42:28.877 --> 42:30.047
Okay?

42:30.048 --> 42:31.650
Okay.

42:33.151 --> 42:35.954
Mm.

42:38.556 --> 42:41.729
Let's have another dessert. I
thought the rule was just one.

42:41.730 --> 42:44.733
Oh, who cares about rules?
