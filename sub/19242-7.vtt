00:55.263 --> 00:56.431
What are you doing there?

00:56.931 --> 00:58.892
I came to see if you were okay.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.310
You should've called.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.437
Did you see my letter?

01:03.229 --> 01:04.272
Yeah, I did.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.400
You saw it and didn't even call?

01:07.859 --> 01:09.110
Who is that?

01:09.652 --> 01:10.612
Mister.

01:11.237 --> 01:14.240
You said my life would reset
once I got married.

01:15.366 --> 01:17.535
That my future would change, didn't you?

01:18.119 --> 01:18.953
I did.

01:21.831 --> 01:27.045
I think my future has become more twisted
than it was.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.463
Hey.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.382
Just put the future aside.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.676
Focus on the present.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.346
"The future will take care of itself."

01:36.846 --> 01:39.766
Is that kind of thinking
focusing on the present?

01:46.231 --> 01:47.065
Hey,

01:47.482 --> 01:50.443
I'll call you tomorrow. Go home.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.986
-I'm going.
-Why?

01:52.487 --> 01:53.738
Are you running away?

01:54.322 --> 01:55.156
Mister!

01:56.866 --> 01:58.618
What's this? This is really weird.

01:59.410 --> 02:00.495
Where are you going?

02:07.043 --> 02:09.003
Come on! Why are you doing this?

02:09.546 --> 02:12.257
Why are you avoiding me like this?

02:13.675 --> 02:15.510
Would you please tell me?

02:19.305 --> 02:20.223
Mister.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.893
-You saw something in the future?
-Hey.

02:25.937 --> 02:29.732
Do you think it's a blessing
that we get to know the future?

02:42.412 --> 02:44.914
It would be terrifying not to know.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.085
What if we're destroying today
for the sake of tomorrow?

02:49.961 --> 02:54.090
What if we're complicating our fate
to change the future?

02:57.051 --> 02:58.553
I'm getting very confused.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.431
I told you.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.350
I'm going to disappear this winter.

03:05.393 --> 03:08.146
I don't know if I'm going to be alive
in two years or not.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.528
Is it a blessing to know the future?

03:16.446 --> 03:18.364
It's a complete relief!

03:18.990 --> 03:21.743
Because I get to know how screwed up
my future will be.

03:21.826 --> 03:25.205
The more you try to know,
you make it worse for both of you.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.333
What?

03:29.334 --> 03:30.418
What I meant was...

03:30.919 --> 03:32.712
So... So-joon,

03:33.213 --> 03:35.131
just trust me.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.927
Quit going to the future
for just one month, okay?

03:40.887 --> 03:43.181
You have to trust me.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.725
Whatever you see in the future,

03:46.100 --> 03:49.604
no matter how strangely I behave...

03:50.605 --> 03:52.607
I'm on your side.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.611
You have to trust that until the very end.

03:57.445 --> 03:58.321
Okay?

04:04.494 --> 04:05.370
You should leave.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.164
How can I trust you, Mister?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.334
I have no idea what you think.
How can I trust you?

04:13.253 --> 04:16.881
I won't ask for your help again.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.551
Do you really think...

04:22.971 --> 04:24.764
I wouldn't be able to protect my girl?

04:27.183 --> 04:28.726
I mean... So-joon.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.812
So-- So-joon.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.089
<i>What was that expression?</i>

04:59.590 --> 05:03.261
<i>He was a stranger.</i>
<i>I've never seen that face before.</i>

05:04.178 --> 05:06.597
<i>An unfamiliar face that I don't know.</i>

05:14.564 --> 05:15.523
Where did you go?

05:16.983 --> 05:20.028
I just went to get some air.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.322
Alone?

05:23.239 --> 05:24.115
Yes.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.787
Don't you have anything to say?

05:30.913 --> 05:32.915
You told me not to speak to you.

05:35.293 --> 05:39.088
-Still, don't you have anything to say?
-Are we sleeping in separate rooms?

05:40.715 --> 05:41.924
Depends on you.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.470
There needs to be an excuse for making up.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.640
Okay. Tell me when you're over your anger.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.602
You'll need time to sort out
your emotions.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.270
I won't bother you.

06:01.736 --> 06:02.820
What was that?

06:03.654 --> 06:05.156
He should be holding me.

06:21.255 --> 06:22.298
Just come in.

06:24.258 --> 06:26.177
I was going to go in, out of habit.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.012
My heart isn't in it.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.390
Use this room.
I'll use the smaller room.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.642
No, it's okay. You use it.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.186
My heart isn't at ease about it.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.607
Your heart isn't at ease

06:39.982 --> 06:41.484
and my body will not be at ease.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.152
We'll be the same.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.121
Something is going on.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.164
It's serious.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.670
There are too many things that are off.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.756
He lies all the time.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.969
This is not normal, not at all.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.944
This is dream.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.739
Do you want to be doing house chores
even in your dreams?

07:32.410 --> 07:37.707
This mountain of clothes must represent
my mountain of stress.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.085
Wake up, already.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.838
Wake up!

07:47.300 --> 07:48.176
What is this?

07:51.304 --> 07:54.390
WE MADE HYDROGEN BOMBS

07:54.474 --> 07:57.810
The train will go even if the dog barks?

08:01.522 --> 08:03.858
The capitalist products!

08:05.151 --> 08:06.110
Realtor.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.571
Do not call me that.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.910
Why are you talking like that?

08:15.077 --> 08:16.829
Where was your hometown again?

08:19.040 --> 08:22.251
I am from Pyongyang in
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.212
That's nonsense.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.256
How is a North Korean so stylish?

08:31.636 --> 08:32.512
What are you doing?

08:33.554 --> 08:36.140
Spy? Are you a spy?

08:36.224 --> 08:37.642
What are you doing? Oh, my!

08:38.100 --> 08:40.061
You know too much.

08:40.686 --> 08:44.690
-Die quietly for the sake of the homeland.
-No, this is a dream.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.608
Die.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.193
You're dreaming too. Wake up.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.861
-Die.
-Wake up.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.531
Die!

08:51.614 --> 08:52.448
Wake up!

08:52.532 --> 08:55.034
-Die.
-Wake up!

09:01.874 --> 09:05.169
Realtor. I just had a dream about you.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.046
What kind of dream?

09:18.224 --> 09:19.225
No!

09:23.688 --> 09:24.730
What now?

09:26.357 --> 09:27.567
Is this a dream too?

09:29.443 --> 09:30.736
You can't die.

09:31.612 --> 09:32.446
No.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.538
Who dies?

09:41.247 --> 09:42.331
Who's dying?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.291
No.

09:45.418 --> 09:49.463
Hey, it's okay. You can tell me.

09:49.630 --> 09:50.631
Tell me.

09:51.048 --> 09:51.924
What are you doing?

09:53.676 --> 09:54.510
Hey,

09:55.720 --> 09:58.014
why are you blowing into my ear?

09:58.806 --> 10:01.183
You were talking in your sleep,
so I came in.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.312
Why were you talking so much
in your sleep?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.105
What have you been doing?

10:07.106 --> 10:12.028
You don't have to pretend
to be mad like that.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.988
<i>Ma-rin's husband</i>
<i>is your husband's chairman.</i>

10:56.197 --> 10:59.116
<i>A person's life can change so suddenly.</i>

11:18.636 --> 11:21.263
Secretary Hwang, I need to see you now.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.935
You want to know
about Chairman Yu's skeletons?

11:26.644 --> 11:28.896
Everyone has something dirty to hide.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.439
He must have some faults.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.734
I need to know what that is.

11:35.111 --> 11:38.155
Faults? He has several.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.782
-Really?
-Yes.

11:39.865 --> 11:40.866
What are they?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.786
For one thing, he doesn't work hard.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.455
He barely... he doesn't work at all.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.417
Life is a joke,
and work is his playground.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.794
Being rich with lots of time is a fault?

11:52.336 --> 11:53.421
That's attractive.

11:53.963 --> 11:57.133
Ah, I see. It's attractive.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.677
I was being too negative about it.

12:00.177 --> 12:03.889
I've heard that he's mysterious and odd.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.099
He is. Yes.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.060
Let's get straight.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.772
Does he have any issues with other women?

12:12.481 --> 12:15.276
Does he lust after them
or have messy relationships?

12:15.359 --> 12:17.027
Is he a bit of a pervert?

12:18.362 --> 12:19.947
I'm hoping for any of the three.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.577
Relationships with women.

12:25.494 --> 12:26.328
Well...

12:27.413 --> 12:31.417
I don't know
if I should tell you about this.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.334
What is it?

12:33.210 --> 12:38.257
This is so big
that I haven't even told the director.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.259
What is it? You can tell me.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.844
Tell me.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.013
Well, it's just...

12:45.514 --> 12:46.557
It's the chairman's...

12:48.476 --> 12:50.227
sexual identity.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.441
Sexual identity?

12:58.152 --> 13:01.655
I happened to... overhear

13:01.739 --> 13:05.367
the chairman talking to Manager Kang.

13:05.826 --> 13:08.412
Why did you do something
I didn't ask for?

13:08.954 --> 13:11.165
I've always felt

13:11.248 --> 13:14.168
they've had a strange relationship.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.338
It's more than just friendship.

13:17.588 --> 13:20.549
Then I heard the conclusive words.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.302
I've been living at your place.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.012
Think of it as rent.

13:25.721 --> 13:26.931
Living at his place?

13:27.097 --> 13:29.058
I really hate it.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.478
-Come on, Ki-doong.
-Stop!

13:32.561 --> 13:33.479
He's touching him!

13:33.562 --> 13:35.314
-Don't be mad.
-Stop.

13:35.397 --> 13:36.482
Is he getting pouty?

13:37.107 --> 13:39.819
This isn't the kind of smile
a man gives another man.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.530
This is the face men make
when they see girl groups.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.783
<i>-Don't be like that, not between us.</i>
<i>-Oh, you're...</i>

13:45.866 --> 13:47.159
He said "between us".

13:47.243 --> 13:49.578
All right, watch this.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.872
There will be bold touching
on the left side.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.500
Men wouldn't do this
even if they were paid.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.919
Yes, I see that you're right.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.755
They just can't live without each other.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.883
They also share
the chairman's office.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.095
That's unheard of in a company.

14:06.178 --> 14:10.057
They don't care
about what the world thinks.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.308
They're very passionate.

14:11.392 --> 14:14.603
They're burning hot.
They're just flying hot.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.605
They share an office?

14:16.689 --> 14:18.524
-The chairman and a manager?
-Yes.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.067
Watch this part here.

14:20.150 --> 14:23.070
This will confirm it.

14:23.737 --> 14:28.242
<i>Let's meet at your house</i>
<i>on December 3rd this year.</i>

14:29.118 --> 14:30.244
<i>Why?</i>

14:30.327 --> 14:32.329
<i>I want to tell you what it's all about.</i>

14:32.538 --> 14:34.415
<i>I don't want to complicate your life.</i>

14:34.957 --> 14:37.543
<i>But I have something I need to ask you.</i>

14:37.877 --> 14:38.794
That's the end.

14:39.628 --> 14:40.838
What does that mean?

14:41.255 --> 14:43.299
They see each other daily.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.260
Why would they promise to see each other
in December?

14:47.177 --> 14:50.097
I will confess all of my feelings for you
on that day.

14:50.472 --> 14:54.393
Let's meet on that day in December
and make it romantic.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.106
"On December 3, this year...

15:00.274 --> 15:03.235
let's promise to meet at your house."

15:04.361 --> 15:05.446
-Oh, my.
-Oh, my.

15:05.529 --> 15:09.325
-Oh, my! I can't believe it.
-Oh, my.

15:09.742 --> 15:10.868
It's love.

15:11.368 --> 15:14.330
A forbidden and sad love
that can't be spoken of.

15:15.539 --> 15:19.501
I thought it was strange
that he married Bap-soon in a rush.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.921
-A marriage to hide himself?
-Hide...

15:22.171 --> 15:24.340
-His sexual identity... Oh dear.
-Oh my.

15:34.141 --> 15:37.061
No, this is my area.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.732
Go over there.

15:45.986 --> 15:48.614
Hey. Come over here.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.200
Go over there.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.246
Do you understand me?

15:57.623 --> 15:58.457
Stop.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.133
Even the vacuum
in this house is a mystery.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.063
What?

16:23.941 --> 16:24.817
Now?

16:27.945 --> 16:29.196
I sent you a text.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.783
That's Manager Kang's address,
where your husband's been living.

16:32.866 --> 16:33.742
Look into it.

16:35.202 --> 16:38.205
Your husband is cheating.
Who cares if it's with a man or a woman?

16:38.288 --> 16:40.207
You just have to catch him.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.417
Hey, Lee Gun-sook.

16:42.126 --> 16:46.463
What will you do if Chairman Yu
likes men and married you to hide that?

16:46.547 --> 16:50.467
Your life will be totally over.

16:51.635 --> 16:54.096
With women,
at least you can pull their hair out.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.681
How will you beat up a man?

16:56.682 --> 16:59.393
My husband's man.

16:59.727 --> 17:00.602
Hey.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.939
That's harsh. It really is.

17:04.815 --> 17:05.774
You're excited.

17:06.942 --> 17:07.985
You're very excited.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.071
Does time go backward for Lee Gun-sook?

17:11.822 --> 17:13.574
Why do you get more childish?

17:13.657 --> 17:15.784
I'm just saying this out of concern.

17:16.243 --> 17:19.371
-The rumors could get really messy.
-Enough.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.791
I can't take this anymore.

17:24.168 --> 17:27.087
Do you sit around 24 hours a day
thinking how to screw me over?

17:28.088 --> 17:30.466
You don't get paid for it.
Why work so hard at it?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.718
You should get paid for it.

17:34.803 --> 17:37.056
Do you think I'm making this up?

17:38.057 --> 17:40.726
Fine. Believe what you want.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.397
Listen.

17:46.106 --> 17:50.903
If you ran out of fresh ideas, retire now.
Or bring something more innovative.

17:50.986 --> 17:54.156
What could be more innovative than this?

17:54.239 --> 17:56.408
It's a man. Not a woman, a man.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.410
Seriously, stop with the nonsense.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.915
Also, you shouldn't go after my family.

18:03.457 --> 18:06.168
What kind of dirty play is this?

18:09.463 --> 18:10.923
Check your message.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.092
Take a good look.

18:14.551 --> 18:15.636
Go ahead!

18:22.518 --> 18:25.062
What am I doing right now?

18:25.687 --> 18:27.648
Where is 12 Hannam-dong?

18:30.359 --> 18:31.652
Aren't you going home?

18:32.444 --> 18:34.571
You'll be bored having dinner alone.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.532
I'll eat with you and go.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.827
Do you feel scared to go home
and eat dinner now?

18:40.619 --> 18:42.246
Am I the type to be scared?

18:42.704 --> 18:43.747
Whatever.

18:44.873 --> 18:48.919
You can't even go home,
and you're here at your friend's house.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.879
My gosh.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.967
It's so dirty! Go into that corner.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.886
-Help me up.
-Get up now. Hurry.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.848
Seriously, you punk!

19:11.024 --> 19:12.067
You're heavy.

19:13.610 --> 19:14.486
Yes.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.532
I'll rest a bit.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.450
<i>Where are you now?</i>

19:26.790 --> 19:29.376
<i>I'm working. I'll be a bit late today.</i>

19:31.587 --> 19:33.172
Of course, he's at work.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.882
Why would he be here?

19:38.385 --> 19:39.428
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

19:41.388 --> 19:42.347
<i>For what?</i>

19:42.764 --> 19:45.434
<i>I just did something to be sorry for.</i>

19:45.976 --> 19:47.102
<i>It's nothing.</i>

19:50.480 --> 19:51.940
<i>I have so much work to do today.</i>

19:52.441 --> 19:54.985
<i>Still, I am the head of the family.</i>
<i>I'll do my best!</i>

19:55.360 --> 19:56.737
Let's go play pool.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.113
He has lots of work!

19:58.197 --> 19:59.865
-No.
-Why not?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.993
-Internet Cafe.
-Are you a kid?

20:03.076 --> 20:05.746
-Are you an old man, then?
-Let's go and play pool.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.670
Isn't that Ma-rin?

20:16.006 --> 20:17.216
Honey!

20:19.218 --> 20:20.594
What brings you here?

20:20.677 --> 20:22.721
I came by to run some errands.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.099
-Hello.
-Hello.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.060
-It's been a long time.
-Yes.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.647
-Honey.
-Yes.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.733
I'm so shocked! What a small world.

20:34.816 --> 20:36.985
Aren't you cold? No?

20:37.069 --> 20:38.820
I don't think this was a coincidence.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.656
What wasn't?

20:42.074 --> 20:43.992
-What?
-What wasn't?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.077
It's not that.

20:45.160 --> 20:49.957
We met by coincidence. I'll get going now.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.085
Hey!

21:02.886 --> 21:05.764
Did you follow me or something? Why?

21:06.139 --> 21:07.349
You said you were at work.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.103
You must be working at Ki-doong's house.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.563
Oh, that...

21:15.315 --> 21:16.525
Are you dating Ki-doong?

21:17.484 --> 21:18.318
What?

21:19.236 --> 21:22.364
Someone told me
that you two are living together.

21:25.325 --> 21:26.410
Do you like men?

21:27.911 --> 21:29.871
Did you marry me to hide that fact?

21:31.999 --> 21:34.876
That's the most absurd thing I've heard
in my entire life.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.131
Let's not do this here.
Let's go for now.

21:39.756 --> 21:42.217
No, I want to talk here.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.178
I can't hold it in
for one more minute.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.808
Who was that man you met
in front of our house?

21:51.685 --> 21:53.395
What man?

21:56.648 --> 22:00.610
Who was that man you met
in front of our house last night?

22:02.404 --> 22:05.324
You went after him when he ran off
like a movie.

22:07.617 --> 22:08.452
You saw that?

22:09.411 --> 22:10.537
Who was he?

22:11.246 --> 22:13.206
He's just someone I know.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.250
Don't get angry.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.671
What is it? Are you sick?

22:20.756 --> 22:22.090
My head hurts so much.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.260
Let's organize this.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.975
You're a self-made chairman
of a real estate investment company.

22:32.059 --> 22:34.561
You're like an anonymous angel
that appears on the news.

22:34.853 --> 22:37.856
Your hobbies are skipping work
and going to internet cafes.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.778
This alone is weird.
I don't understand.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.572
It's inconsistent.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.617
A company chairman skips work
and goes to internet cafes.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.120
You're always lying,

22:52.829 --> 22:55.082
and you meet strange men at night.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.002
There are sneakers in our house
that wrap around your ankles.

22:59.169 --> 23:02.589
There's a crazy vacuum
that thinks it's a dog.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.676
The thing that bothers me the most is

23:07.135 --> 23:09.596
the article about the elected president
Ryu Sun-kwang.

23:11.181 --> 23:13.475
The election campaign hasn't even started.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.520
Why is a paper from next year
in our house?

23:16.895 --> 23:19.147
Why do you insist that I was mistaken?

23:25.904 --> 23:27.489
Unless you're a spy,

23:28.323 --> 23:30.200
I just can't understand it.

23:34.121 --> 23:38.250
I was a soldier in Korea's military.

23:44.464 --> 23:46.091
Do you have multiple personalities?

23:47.843 --> 23:51.638
Is that why you're a spy, a chairman,
an angel, and so on?

23:56.601 --> 23:57.853
I'm a time traveler.

23:58.728 --> 23:59.604
What?

24:01.022 --> 24:02.232
A time slipper.

24:03.316 --> 24:04.901
I'm a time traveler.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.742
Even now, you're playing around.

24:15.662 --> 24:16.955
A time traveler.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.167
A time traveler?

24:21.668 --> 24:22.961
A time traveler?

24:32.179 --> 24:34.681
Why... are you crying?

24:35.974 --> 24:37.934
Is this something to cry over?

24:44.441 --> 24:46.526
You're so immature, seriously.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.364
You're too much.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.249
All you have to say
is you're a time traveler?

25:01.958 --> 25:03.960
You're a time traveler, bastard?

25:12.802 --> 25:14.012
Ma-rin...

25:15.096 --> 25:18.475
You're really going too far.
How could you do this?

25:32.280 --> 25:33.323
Ma-rin.

25:38.328 --> 25:41.831
Ma-rin. Let's have a serious talk.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.208
Please?

25:46.002 --> 25:47.170
Ma-rin.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.230
This is crazy.

26:16.866 --> 26:19.077
Dad, you're in a really good mood today!

26:19.911 --> 26:23.248
It's written all over your face.
You're smiling ear to ear.

26:23.331 --> 26:25.041
Of course!

26:26.001 --> 26:28.712
It's not just one or two
House of Love has built.

26:28.795 --> 26:30.213
We've built 30 now!

26:31.756 --> 26:33.842
Oh yeah. Is Ki-doong coming?

26:34.217 --> 26:36.219
I told him to come if he has time.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.387
Why would he come?

26:37.721 --> 26:40.473
I just told him to come
if he has the time.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.809
Dad, why did you do that?

26:47.856 --> 26:50.483
Yu So-joon, why did you marry Bap-soon?

26:50.567 --> 26:53.320
Are you happy with her?

26:53.403 --> 26:54.779
Yu So-joon, you bastard.

27:01.369 --> 27:02.287
You're here?

27:03.705 --> 27:04.873
Of course I came.

27:04.956 --> 27:07.834
I was the one to receive the first house.

27:12.922 --> 27:14.299
You seem different today.

27:15.925 --> 27:16.843
What?

27:17.552 --> 27:19.429
This is the best house that you've built.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.099
My family's home
in Daejeon can't compare to this.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.727
Really? Thanks.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.439
The woman I drank and fought with.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.942
The man my husband was in a scandal with.

27:34.569 --> 27:36.321
Gosh, how awkward.

27:40.992 --> 27:41.993
Hello.

27:42.702 --> 27:43.995
Hello.

27:45.830 --> 27:48.333
You seem different
now that I'm seeing you here.

27:50.001 --> 27:51.628
You said the same thing to me.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.338
Excuse me?

27:53.755 --> 27:55.006
I wasn't talking to you.

28:01.137 --> 28:04.057
I guess the others haven't arrived yet.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.227
I suppose not.

28:14.567 --> 28:15.652
Why is it so awkward?

28:20.573 --> 28:21.908
We're here early.

28:21.991 --> 28:24.369
We're early. Being diligent is a fault.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.204
It really is, isn't it?

28:30.875 --> 28:31.793
Don't you agree?

28:36.172 --> 28:37.716
Who am I supposed to talk to now?

28:41.845 --> 28:44.806
<i>There are two players left now...</i>

28:44.889 --> 28:45.974
<i>A nesting place.</i>

28:46.433 --> 28:50.645
<i>A warm and cozy place to rest.</i>

28:51.062 --> 28:57.193
<i>However, people these days see their homes</i>
<i>as an asset rather than a nesting place.</i>

28:58.611 --> 29:01.281
<i>"Where do you live?",</i>

29:01.990 --> 29:04.242
in many cases means

29:04.993 --> 29:08.079
"How affluent is your neighborhood?"

29:09.414 --> 29:11.082
When I'm faced with these questions,

29:12.041 --> 29:14.544
I'm often left speechless.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.505
So I just smile.

29:18.047 --> 29:19.215
I just smile.

29:21.050 --> 29:25.388
I suppose money is important
in this world.

29:26.014 --> 29:30.602
But the precious time
we spend every day with our family

29:31.186 --> 29:35.273
and the precious memories
we make in our homes,

29:36.399 --> 29:39.778
aren't they not what brings us
the most joy?

29:39.861 --> 29:41.237
-Yes, they are!
-Yes!

29:44.908 --> 29:48.161
With this 30th House of Love,

29:48.244 --> 29:51.581
congratulations to our elders
who will live there.

29:52.457 --> 29:55.627
I hope you live here for a long time,
like newlyweds.

29:56.127 --> 30:00.548
Join your hands tightly
and live together happily.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.525
CHOO SANG-KYU
CHO EUN-SIL

30:18.608 --> 30:20.485
Everyone looks great right now.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.195
I'll take the photo.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.572
Say "happy" on the count of three.

30:24.781 --> 30:26.658
One, two, three.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.701
-Happy!
-Happy!

30:33.081 --> 30:34.666
Do you have to make it so obvious?

30:36.042 --> 30:36.876
What?

30:38.044 --> 30:40.505
You know. You're being really awkward.

30:40.588 --> 30:41.923
Gosh.

30:43.216 --> 30:44.843
I'm very relaxed right now.

30:45.677 --> 30:46.886
-Hey, Kang Ki-doong.
-Hey.

30:47.303 --> 30:49.264
Whether you like So-joon or not,

30:49.514 --> 30:52.392
what does that have to do with me
that I would make it obvious?

30:54.310 --> 30:57.272
You're the one who's embarrassed.
You can't even look at me.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.693
Do you feel less embarrassed
if you blame other people?

31:06.865 --> 31:09.951
Does So-joon know
you have this crush on him?

31:10.034 --> 31:12.537
Stop playing around! Stop it.

31:13.329 --> 31:14.289
Jeez.

31:14.747 --> 31:18.585
So you better listen to me,
or I'll tell So-joon about it.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.920
Are you going to listen to me or not?

31:23.047 --> 31:24.507
Oh, my God!

31:24.591 --> 31:26.259
Are you having fun?

31:26.342 --> 31:28.553
You might be having fun with this.

31:28.636 --> 31:30.096
But, I'm...

31:30.179 --> 31:32.265
-You're not okay?
-That's right. I'm not!

31:32.724 --> 31:34.767
So, don't joke around, okay?

31:34.851 --> 31:37.729
I'm going to joke around.
I will until you stop.

31:38.771 --> 31:42.859
I'm going to tease you
until we look back and laugh about this.

31:42.942 --> 31:44.068
Did I ask for your help?

31:44.193 --> 31:46.446
I'm so annoyed that you know.

31:46.529 --> 31:50.158
It's uncomfortable and upsetting
that you're trying to console me.

31:50.491 --> 31:52.869
If you have any tact, pretend not to know.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.496
Who are you to say anything? Gosh!

31:55.580 --> 31:57.457
Then you shouldn't have been caught.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.962
I don't know how serious you were
and I don't want to know.

32:03.129 --> 32:06.507
But, what can you do
even if you were sincere?

32:10.970 --> 32:12.472
Stop pretending to be so cool.

32:14.974 --> 32:16.976
Laugh and get over it.
What else can you do?

32:19.646 --> 32:21.147
Jeez. You're annoying.

32:28.571 --> 32:30.281
I'm annoying when I smile, right?

32:32.158 --> 32:33.785
Oh, you nuisance!

32:34.494 --> 32:35.787
That's enough.

32:39.791 --> 32:40.875
Ma'am.

32:42.710 --> 32:43.753
Sir.

33:12.365 --> 33:13.241
You scared me.

33:14.409 --> 33:16.452
Why? Keep taking pictures.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.871
You said you wanted
to take pictures of me.

33:20.498 --> 33:21.457
Why are you here?

33:22.750 --> 33:24.293
I was bored at home, alone.

33:28.464 --> 33:31.592
I came to see you, of course.
Why else would I come all this way?

33:33.011 --> 33:34.679
Why would you come when I'm working?

33:35.722 --> 33:37.223
Can't you see I'm working?

33:37.306 --> 33:40.810
This is nothing compared to coming
to my friend's house to catch me.

33:46.232 --> 33:47.984
Move. I have to pass out rice cakes.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.194
You're touched, right?

33:51.154 --> 33:52.321
Touched? Yeah, right.

33:52.405 --> 33:55.116
Think about it. I'm sure you are.

33:55.491 --> 33:57.744
-Hello, have some rice cakes.
-Oh my.

33:57.827 --> 34:00.955
-Where did these come from?
-I really like these rice cakes.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.874
-They look good.
-Thank you.

34:02.957 --> 34:04.917
-This is my wife.
-Oh, really?

34:06.127 --> 34:08.921
-So-joon is here?
-Yes.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.007
Oh, you know him too!

34:11.090 --> 34:12.508
Yes, he's a friend.

34:12.633 --> 34:14.469
-Why is So-joon here?
-Why?

34:16.387 --> 34:17.513
They're newlyweds.

34:17.597 --> 34:20.183
Though they live together,
they don't want to be apart.

34:20.516 --> 34:21.768
-Hello.
-Hello.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.353
-You should've told me you were coming.
-It worked out.

34:24.437 --> 34:27.065
-You must love your wife too much!
-I just love my wife.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.275
-Honey!
-We're done with the event.

34:29.650 --> 34:30.818
Ma-rin, you're done too.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.612
You should go.
He came to pick you up.

34:33.279 --> 34:34.739
I came right on time.

34:35.198 --> 34:36.532
I'm not done yet.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.826
The household goods are coming.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.247
You said you came to help.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.041
Help with the moving.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.042
That?

34:46.125 --> 34:48.211
We're happy to get an extra hand.

34:48.294 --> 34:50.129
You look like you'd be good at moving.

34:50.213 --> 34:51.881
What about me makes you think that?

34:51.964 --> 34:53.466
What do you do for a living?

34:54.258 --> 34:55.259
He is a realtor.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.472
-We'll just talk for a bit first.
-Go ahead.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.557
You want me to move that?

35:01.891 --> 35:03.810
I don't like physical labor.

35:04.018 --> 35:05.812
This doesn't suit my personality.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.480
Then go to the internet cafe.

35:08.356 --> 35:10.608
Or you could go time traveling.

35:11.359 --> 35:12.777
Let's work together.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.365
He's totally under her control.

35:19.659 --> 35:21.077
You were very obvious just now.

35:21.911 --> 35:22.829
About what?

35:23.162 --> 35:25.414
It was obvious that you were jealous.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.876
Ma-rin is here.
Try not to show it on your face.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.508
Oh my.

35:36.008 --> 35:37.718
Jeez.

35:37.802 --> 35:40.012
-Realtor.
-Huh?

35:40.429 --> 35:42.140
What is it? What?

35:50.439 --> 35:51.274
I will carry it.

35:51.357 --> 35:52.650
-Let's go.
-Here it comes.

35:53.109 --> 35:54.026
Dang it.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.570
All right. Slowly now.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.530
One, two.

35:57.613 --> 35:59.407
One, two.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.284
-Oh my.
-Slowly.

36:02.201 --> 36:04.370
One, two.

36:22.638 --> 36:25.016
Ma-rin, what should I do now?

36:25.183 --> 36:26.601
Oh, that.

36:26.684 --> 36:27.602
Okay.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.145
This one. No that one.

36:29.812 --> 36:30.771
Should I pour this?

36:30.855 --> 36:32.648
-No.
-What are you doing here?

36:32.732 --> 36:34.358
Come on over. You're a good worker.

36:34.650 --> 36:36.027
-Ma-rin.
-Come on.

36:37.028 --> 36:37.987
Wait.

36:38.362 --> 36:39.614
Hold onto this.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.115
Lift it.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.409
One, two, one, two.

36:43.492 --> 36:45.703
One, two.

36:45.786 --> 36:48.080
One, two.

36:48.164 --> 36:51.375
One, two...

36:51.459 --> 36:53.085
MYREITS

36:53.169 --> 36:54.587
<i>Did you ask for me, Director?</i>

36:54.670 --> 36:55.922
-I did.
-Yes.

36:56.005 --> 36:57.590
About Jangho city...

36:58.424 --> 37:01.385
You had that review plan
from the city, right?

37:01.510 --> 37:03.346
Yes. It's too bad
the project was killed.

37:03.763 --> 37:05.556
Killed? Who says it was killed?

37:06.474 --> 37:08.351
Bring me the city sketch for review.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.937
Prepare the land register
and deed information.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.857
The chairman insisted
on shutting that down...

37:14.941 --> 37:16.943
Who decides
whether that gets shut down?

37:17.026 --> 37:18.986
I decide.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.738
Get it together, Secretary Hwang.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.074
-Okay.
-Hurry. I'm busy.

37:23.157 --> 37:23.991
Okay.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.372
So, this is a sketch of the plan.

37:35.836 --> 37:38.464
I wouldn't really know anything
even if I looked at this.

37:39.882 --> 37:42.760
I have heard that Jangho
could make me a lot of money.

37:43.719 --> 37:46.180
LE Group's headquarters is being built
in Jangho.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.350
That is a fact
to a few quick people like myself.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.559
I'm so frustrated.

37:50.643 --> 37:52.728
Chairman Yu just says no.

37:53.688 --> 37:54.689
I don't know why.

37:54.772 --> 37:57.149
If you don't invest in this,
you would be stupid.

37:57.483 --> 37:58.943
So, Chairman...

37:59.235 --> 38:02.947
Oh, no. I'm not a chairman.

38:03.030 --> 38:04.365
Don't burden me like that.

38:04.782 --> 38:05.825
Just call me Teacher.

38:05.908 --> 38:08.077
That was my dream when I was younger.

38:08.619 --> 38:10.705
Okay, Teacher.

38:12.164 --> 38:16.585
If you are truly looking for something
to make you money,

38:16.836 --> 38:19.338
I would put my dead mother's name... no.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.049
I would put my own neck on the line.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.801
That's how strongly
I recommend this.

38:23.884 --> 38:25.761
-I'm serious.
-Why would you go that far?

38:25.845 --> 38:29.140
It's not much money. Just relax, okay?

38:30.891 --> 38:31.726
Have a drink.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.561
Once it's announced…

38:34.145 --> 38:39.150
I can guarantee you will make
at least two times the money.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.109
Is that so?

38:40.401 --> 38:43.404
I know Chairman Yu is extraordinary.

38:43.487 --> 38:47.825
However, this time Yu So-joon
is one hundred percent wrong.

38:48.034 --> 38:50.578
Yu So-joon has lost his touch.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.372
He said he wouldn't invest in Jangho.

38:53.539 --> 38:54.957
I thought that was very odd.

38:55.041 --> 38:56.667
Right? It's stupid, very stupid.

38:58.252 --> 39:00.880
All right, then how do we do this?

39:01.922 --> 39:03.799
If I am to invest...

39:05.343 --> 39:06.886
you will have to leave Myreits.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.931
Are you ready to start your own business?

39:11.307 --> 39:15.061
No, I'm planning on staying there
for now.

39:15.853 --> 39:16.729
What?

39:18.856 --> 39:22.943
So, you're saying
you'll do this behind his back?

39:25.071 --> 39:25.905
Why?

39:26.197 --> 39:30.117
If money is the issue,
I said I'll provide it.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.118
That's not it.

39:31.202 --> 39:34.330
I have some things
I am owed from the company.

39:37.166 --> 39:40.961
Still, isn't it kind of dangerous
to do this in secret?

39:41.045 --> 39:43.172
No, it's not dangerous.

39:43.255 --> 39:47.051
When all my investors jump
into Jangho city,

39:47.134 --> 39:50.054
I can set up my own company then
and take it slowly.

39:50.846 --> 39:52.556
Once I complete the land contract.

39:53.307 --> 39:57.770
So, you want to take
all of Myreits' clients?

39:57.853 --> 39:59.772
Teacher, I'm sure you looked into it.

39:59.855 --> 40:01.649
But please trust me.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.859
Look this over with a positive mind.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.279
I'll think about it.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.990
Teacher...

40:10.699 --> 40:12.701
Oh, ouch.

40:13.577 --> 40:16.705
I worked so hard
that I can't even use the chopsticks.

40:22.002 --> 40:23.170
Are you in a lot of pain?

40:24.630 --> 40:25.548
Thanks to someone.

40:27.174 --> 40:30.428
The guys will drive,
so you two can drink.

40:30.845 --> 40:31.720
-Ah...
-No.

40:32.346 --> 40:33.556
-Why can't I?
-Why not?

40:34.098 --> 40:37.226
Don't you remember the trouble
you two caused in the wine bar?

40:40.104 --> 40:41.397
Is So-joon good to you?

40:41.480 --> 40:43.482
He's immature.
He must be hard to live with.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.280
I'll go get some water.

40:49.738 --> 40:50.823
I can get it.

40:50.906 --> 40:52.032
Why are you going?

40:52.491 --> 40:53.325
It's okay.

40:58.747 --> 41:00.082
Here. Eat this.

41:02.751 --> 41:03.836
I'll take some water.

41:04.378 --> 41:05.212
Okay.

41:11.552 --> 41:12.803
I'm sorry to ask.

41:13.471 --> 41:16.807
Do you happen to have medicated pads
for sore muscles?

41:16.891 --> 41:18.726
The kind you stick on?

41:18.809 --> 41:20.102
The ones for the shoulders.

41:20.436 --> 41:21.604
Hold on a moment.

41:22.062 --> 41:24.773
I'll give you the ones my husband uses.

41:24.857 --> 41:25.733
Thank you.

41:27.359 --> 41:29.111
I heard something strange from my dad.

41:30.613 --> 41:33.157
Ma-rin didn't know anything
about you and Happiness.

41:34.575 --> 41:37.536
She found out from your dad,
so don't worry.

41:38.329 --> 41:43.125
But she thinks she and my dad
are the only ones who know.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.753
She doesn't know that Ki-doong and I know.

41:45.836 --> 41:47.963
Dad said to watch
what we say around her.

41:49.673 --> 41:50.508
Really?

41:51.258 --> 41:54.637
I'm sure she thought we wouldn't know
since she didn't know.

41:55.137 --> 41:56.180
Isn't that expected?

41:58.933 --> 42:00.893
Why are women so complicated?

42:01.352 --> 42:04.355
Why is it so important
who knows what and who doesn't?

42:04.897 --> 42:08.567
Are they only satisfied
if we know everything about each other?

42:08.651 --> 42:11.654
Hey, you guys are married.

42:11.820 --> 42:13.989
I don't want to take Ma-rin's side,

42:14.073 --> 42:17.535
but I hated it when you two would whisper.
Like you had a secret.

42:18.953 --> 42:22.289
How can your wife know less
about you than us?

42:23.832 --> 42:25.125
Isn't that a given?

42:25.376 --> 42:27.545
I haven't known her as long.

42:28.003 --> 42:29.797
How did you even decide on marriage?

42:30.339 --> 42:31.465
Do you even love her?

42:31.549 --> 42:33.592
What kind of question is that?

42:34.009 --> 42:34.885
Stop it.

42:35.886 --> 42:36.804
Hey.

42:36.887 --> 42:38.722
It seemed like
you were talking about me.

42:38.806 --> 42:41.725
We were talking about us.

42:42.935 --> 42:43.852
Here's the water.

42:45.688 --> 42:46.897
Put that on your shoulder.

42:47.648 --> 42:48.816
I'm going to head out.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.192
What? Now?

42:50.693 --> 42:52.111
I'll be going. Have fun.

42:52.194 --> 42:54.196
How will you get to Seoul?
Let's go together.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.197
I'll go alone.

42:55.281 --> 42:56.699
Ma-rin, wait...

42:58.617 --> 43:00.119
What are you doing? Go after her.

43:03.998 --> 43:04.957
Hey.

43:05.124 --> 43:06.250
Sorry guys.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.422
Song Ma-rin, what is it now?

43:13.090 --> 43:14.758
What is it?

43:15.342 --> 43:17.011
Let go. I just want to leave.

43:17.761 --> 43:19.888
Tell me exactly why you're doing this.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.182
Just like Se-young said,

43:22.266 --> 43:25.519
are you upset because my friends
knew something you didn't?

43:26.395 --> 43:29.315
It's all over now, and you know it too.

43:32.026 --> 43:34.820
I don't know
why I'm so angry and hurt either.

43:35.654 --> 43:38.157
I just want to go home, so leave me alone.

43:38.365 --> 43:40.326
Do you know
that you make me a bit tired?

43:44.747 --> 43:45.581
What?

43:45.873 --> 43:47.458
How long have we known each other?

43:48.083 --> 43:50.169
Don't we need time
to get to know one another?

43:51.086 --> 43:53.088
How far do I have to go to please you?

43:53.839 --> 43:57.551
I came all this way and put in the effort
to make you feel better.

43:59.928 --> 44:03.307
Thank you for trying.
You don't need to force yourself.

44:04.975 --> 44:06.435
Hear me out until the end.

44:09.897 --> 44:12.608
I've never come near Happiness ever,
not once.

44:13.275 --> 44:16.487
Do you know how hard it is
for me to come here?

44:18.030 --> 44:19.990
You haven't told me, how could I know?

44:20.991 --> 44:23.327
I've been curious,
but you haven't talked.

44:26.038 --> 44:27.873
What did you do besides get angry?

44:28.332 --> 44:30.334
You don't see any of the effort I put in.

44:30.626 --> 44:33.337
All you've done is try to change me
to suit what you like.

44:34.171 --> 44:36.423
Don't you see the good,
things to thank me for?

44:36.799 --> 44:38.801
Has this marriage caused
any loss to you?

44:39.593 --> 44:41.136
It hasn't. I...

44:46.767 --> 44:50.020
I've never calculated a profit or loss.

44:51.355 --> 44:52.731
Don't misunderstand me.

44:52.815 --> 44:55.776
You took a loss, and I profited?

44:56.068 --> 44:57.069
That's not it.

44:57.986 --> 45:01.115
All I wanted is to be the person
closest to you.

45:03.867 --> 45:06.912
I didn't need anything else.
I just wanted you.

45:07.538 --> 45:10.958
If that's being greedy and stubborn,
how should I love you?

45:12.167 --> 45:13.711
-Don't go.
-Let go.

45:14.086 --> 45:16.046
How will you get to Seoul this late?

45:16.130 --> 45:16.964
Don't touch me.

45:31.562 --> 45:34.356
<i>You said my life would reset</i>
<i>once I got married.</i>

45:35.357 --> 45:37.818
<i>You said that my future would change,</i>
<i>didn't you?</i>

45:39.570 --> 45:40.487
<i>I did.</i>

45:44.158 --> 45:49.163
<i>I think my future has become more twisted</i>
<i>than it was.</i>

46:34.958 --> 46:37.002
I think So-joon is really weird.

46:39.129 --> 46:40.672
Why are you being like this too?

46:43.425 --> 46:45.010
Hey, don't be like this.

46:45.093 --> 46:46.220
Look, okay?

46:46.720 --> 46:48.096
Take a look.

46:48.180 --> 46:51.350
This air. So fresh.

46:51.475 --> 46:53.268
It's a little cold.

46:54.102 --> 46:57.648
But he did come all this way today.

46:58.690 --> 47:00.526
He must like Ma-rin a lot.

47:04.112 --> 47:05.906
When I bring up donations,

47:06.198 --> 47:08.492
he doesn't listen and just says yes.

47:10.035 --> 47:12.162
He doesn't want to hear
the "H" in "Happiness."

47:17.501 --> 47:19.127
He must like her a lot.

47:30.597 --> 47:31.807
Miss, we've arrived.

47:32.850 --> 47:33.892
Look here, Miss!

47:37.354 --> 47:38.313
Sorry.

48:39.166 --> 48:40.167
Is she not home yet?

48:42.794 --> 48:44.671
<i>Don't tell So-joon.</i>

48:45.380 --> 48:47.382
<i>Just come, So-ri.</i>

48:48.592 --> 48:51.053
<i>Shouldn't she go to a bigger hospital?</i>

48:51.845 --> 48:53.513
It's an infection in her lymph node.

48:53.639 --> 48:56.475
Most patients can be discharged
after two or three days.

48:56.767 --> 48:58.226
Ah, I see.

48:58.685 --> 49:01.855
Her fever went up to 40° Celsius earlier.

49:01.939 --> 49:04.650
It could go up again while she sleeps.

49:04.733 --> 49:06.360
Please keep an eye on her.

49:06.443 --> 49:07.361
Okay.

49:13.825 --> 49:14.910
Don't call.

49:17.496 --> 49:20.290
Not So-joon, or my mom.

49:23.085 --> 49:24.127
You weren't asleep?

49:26.171 --> 49:27.506
What's going on?

49:30.968 --> 49:33.261
-I'm sorry.
-What are you sorry about?

49:34.846 --> 49:36.306
Why can't I call So-joon?

49:37.015 --> 49:39.267
-I'll call him now.
-Don't.

49:44.523 --> 49:45.565
It's so cold.

50:20.434 --> 50:23.270
<i>Things aren't good between you two</i>
<i>since you got married.</i>

50:24.604 --> 50:26.815
<i>I'm very sorry to tell you this.</i>

50:28.150 --> 50:30.193
<i>Break up with Ma-rin when you go back.</i>

50:30.610 --> 50:32.487
<i>For your sake, and Ma-rin's sake.</i>

50:33.613 --> 50:35.449
<i>This is all I can say to you.</i>

50:50.297 --> 50:51.214
Kid.

50:52.507 --> 50:54.092
Try saying "Give me rice."

50:54.593 --> 50:55.427
What?

50:55.510 --> 50:58.555
Say "Give me rice,"

50:58.638 --> 51:00.557
like you'll leave if you don't get rice.

51:01.850 --> 51:02.726
Try it.

51:04.352 --> 51:06.521
Give me rice.

51:08.190 --> 51:09.649
She has some potential.

51:10.108 --> 51:11.068
-She does?
-Yes.

51:11.151 --> 51:12.069
How so?

51:12.152 --> 51:13.695
There are two types.

51:13.779 --> 51:16.198
There are kids who do it
and those who don't.

51:16.573 --> 51:18.658
She's not one or the other.

51:18.867 --> 51:21.787
I've never seen someone make it obvious
she didn't want to do it.

51:21.870 --> 51:24.372
Oh! You are very stubborn.

51:24.456 --> 51:27.375
You've only lived five years,

51:27.459 --> 51:28.877
but you're very strong-willed.

51:29.461 --> 51:30.545
You're very chic.

51:30.629 --> 51:31.671
You've got potential.

51:32.297 --> 51:33.131
You really do.

51:36.593 --> 51:37.844
Oh, son.

51:37.928 --> 51:40.138
My son! So-joon.

51:40.222 --> 51:43.558
You must be busy as a CEO,
but you called your mom!

51:43.767 --> 51:45.769
Did you miss your mom?

51:47.354 --> 51:49.773
Yes. Is everything well?

51:49.856 --> 51:52.943
<i>I am always well.</i>

51:53.527 --> 51:55.445
Well, Mother...

51:56.238 --> 51:57.614
What are you doing right now?<i> </i>

51:57.697 --> 51:58.990
Are you alone?

51:59.199 --> 52:02.536
<i>I'm at the hair salon with some friends.</i>

52:03.453 --> 52:04.538
Oh, I see.

52:05.497 --> 52:08.208
Mother, I'll come to see you soon.

52:08.291 --> 52:10.168
I can go there too.

52:10.335 --> 52:12.295
Okay, bye.

52:16.925 --> 52:18.218
She's not at her mother's?

52:19.719 --> 52:21.972
I won't look for her, either.
She can come or go.

52:22.722 --> 52:23.557
I don't care.

52:25.725 --> 52:27.769
-Aren't you going to the meeting?
-I am.

52:28.436 --> 52:31.064
We had predicted the least development

52:31.148 --> 52:35.902
here in Sanmi region
like Annam-dong and Bansan-dong.

52:36.153 --> 52:40.866
As of yesterday, it has changed
into a special district.

52:41.408 --> 52:43.910
I looked into it and in conclusion,

52:44.578 --> 52:48.290
a bus terminal will be built here.

52:48.915 --> 52:50.834
I heard the specific plans are not out.

52:52.210 --> 52:53.587
Aren't they delaying it?

52:54.588 --> 52:58.091
-A bus terminal is very likely.
-Director Wang!

52:58.925 --> 53:01.011
Why are you being like this?

53:01.553 --> 53:03.096
Are you crazy?

53:03.180 --> 53:06.975
Director Wang, you predicted
development in Annam-dong and Bansan-dong.

53:07.058 --> 53:09.144
The loss is already too great on that.

53:09.227 --> 53:10.645
Why would you push us on it?

53:10.729 --> 53:11.730
Are you sane?

53:11.855 --> 53:13.106
Are you stupid?

53:13.732 --> 53:15.317
You're being too greedy.

53:15.400 --> 53:16.359
MY WIFE RAN AWAY

53:16.443 --> 53:17.652
I mean...

53:17.736 --> 53:19.988
<i>This is Ma-rin's friend, Oh So-ri.</i>

53:20.864 --> 53:23.116
<i>Ma-rin is in the hospital right now.</i>

53:23.366 --> 53:24.326
...tried.

53:25.118 --> 53:28.371
There's no yours and mine.
We're all in it together to succeed.

53:29.414 --> 53:30.248
Hey!

53:51.019 --> 53:52.145
You've arrived.

53:52.729 --> 53:53.855
I'll be outside.

54:03.949 --> 54:04.908
You...

54:06.826 --> 54:08.453
What happened to you?

54:09.371 --> 54:10.747
How sick are you?

54:13.333 --> 54:15.210
I'll be discharged in a day or two.

54:16.044 --> 54:17.003
It's nothing.

54:17.254 --> 54:19.673
Why would you make me worry so much?

54:19.965 --> 54:21.591
You should've called me.

54:23.969 --> 54:25.428
You stayed out all night too.

54:26.179 --> 54:27.847
How come you can, but I can't?

54:28.890 --> 54:29.724
Hey,

54:30.350 --> 54:32.060
how is this the same thing?

54:34.104 --> 54:35.021
I...

54:37.232 --> 54:38.900
don't feel like you're my family.

54:40.402 --> 54:42.570
I feel like I have to hide
when things are hard.

54:44.155 --> 54:45.532
Because you do that to me.

54:48.618 --> 54:50.996
Every now and then,
you seem like a different person.

54:54.958 --> 54:57.002
I thought I knew everything about you.

54:58.712 --> 54:59.838
I don't know anything.

55:01.214 --> 55:02.799
It doesn't feel like you're mine.

55:09.639 --> 55:10.515
So you don't...

55:12.851 --> 55:16.354
feel like you can depend on me at all.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.282
I don't know what I've done wrong.

55:30.118 --> 55:32.370
Maybe we rushed into marriage too fast.

55:37.334 --> 55:39.336
I promised my entire life to you.

55:40.712 --> 55:42.380
Maybe I made a mistake.

55:45.216 --> 55:46.843
I'm scared and worried.

55:54.517 --> 55:55.769
It's not your fault.

55:58.021 --> 55:59.773
I might be the one who's acting weird.

56:01.649 --> 56:02.984
It could be that I am.

56:05.904 --> 56:07.280
I'm sorry.

56:08.782 --> 56:10.450
I want to be alone today.

56:12.410 --> 56:13.244
Leave.

56:38.228 --> 56:39.229
Where are you?

56:39.813 --> 56:41.856
How could you leave the meeting like that?

56:42.690 --> 56:44.109
I'm at Namyeong Station now.

56:44.192 --> 56:45.693
<i>Are you going to the other world?</i>

56:46.069 --> 56:47.404
I need to find out something.

56:48.113 --> 56:48.947
<i>Find out what?</i>

56:49.030 --> 56:50.448
I don't know. Whatever.

56:51.616 --> 56:53.451
When I resolve things with Ma-rin.

56:56.329 --> 56:59.374
Ki-doong, am I kind of pathetic right now?

57:01.918 --> 57:02.836
You know.

57:04.504 --> 57:06.714
Okay. Bye.

57:17.350 --> 57:18.977
<i>The door is opening.</i>

57:21.563 --> 57:23.148
He was so down.

57:23.481 --> 57:27.318
He said, "I'm a source of stress
to Ma-rin" and left.

57:28.069 --> 57:29.779
I felt so sad.

57:30.864 --> 57:32.740
He's just trying to look like a victim.

57:34.159 --> 57:36.703
You are really something, too.

57:37.454 --> 57:39.497
What is it?

57:39.831 --> 57:43.042
You should tell me why
so that I can insult him with you.

57:43.543 --> 57:44.419
You don't need to.

57:46.129 --> 57:49.966
I'm going to eat and gain strength.
I don't want to be weak and depressed.

57:59.684 --> 58:01.311
Oh, were you eating?

58:02.479 --> 58:03.396
You're eating well.

58:04.105 --> 58:06.232
Take your time. I'll wait out here.

58:08.318 --> 58:10.069
Hey, are you okay?

58:10.153 --> 58:10.987
No, I'm not.

58:12.238 --> 58:13.448
-Water.
-Water.

58:15.867 --> 58:17.243
What am I to do with you?

58:18.328 --> 58:20.246
Why did he have to walk in right then?

58:27.253 --> 58:28.421
Go in and eat more.

58:31.591 --> 58:33.051
That was my first meal.

58:34.511 --> 58:35.887
You came in right then.

58:36.971 --> 58:38.973
Yeah, you look that way.

58:40.016 --> 58:41.267
Your face looks so thin.

58:43.436 --> 58:44.896
I ate so I could live.

58:45.355 --> 58:46.606
I felt like I was dying.

58:47.857 --> 58:48.775
You did good.

58:50.818 --> 58:52.111
Don't come here again.

58:53.821 --> 58:55.406
You want anything else to eat?

58:56.908 --> 58:58.701
I really don't have an appetite.

58:59.452 --> 59:01.579
Still, there must be one thing
you want to eat.

59:01.871 --> 59:03.957
Just tell me. I'll buy you anything.

59:09.754 --> 59:10.672
Anything?

59:11.464 --> 59:12.298
Yes.

59:15.635 --> 59:17.095
Then get me raspberries.

59:18.221 --> 59:19.097
Okay.

59:19.347 --> 59:20.223
Hey.

59:22.642 --> 59:24.561
You know nothing
about agricultural goods.

59:25.144 --> 59:26.563
You can't get them in autumn.

59:27.772 --> 59:30.149
This isn't something
we can resolve with food.

59:32.235 --> 59:33.903
Don't try to make up like that.

59:34.821 --> 59:35.655
Go home.

59:39.117 --> 59:40.243
I can get it for you.

59:41.160 --> 59:42.036
I will get it.

59:46.624 --> 59:47.792
Go ahead then.

59:54.882 --> 59:56.175
Where did you get them?

59:56.884 --> 59:59.012
I just went somewhere far.

1:00:02.515 --> 1:00:03.433
Thank you.

1:00:04.058 --> 1:00:05.059
I'll enjoy them.

1:00:05.685 --> 1:00:07.770
Is there anything else you want to eat?

1:00:08.813 --> 1:00:11.149
I know we can't resolve this with food.

1:00:11.691 --> 1:00:13.526
But you do need to eat well.

1:00:13.693 --> 1:00:14.861
Flounder mugwort stew.

1:00:15.528 --> 1:00:17.905
-What?
-Freshly-caught, wild fish.

1:00:19.866 --> 1:00:20.742
Okay.

1:00:21.075 --> 1:00:22.577
You really can't get it.

1:00:23.369 --> 1:00:26.247
They only sell the wild ones in spring.

1:00:27.081 --> 1:00:28.207
Wait just a little bit.

1:00:41.012 --> 1:00:42.388
Where did you get this?

1:00:43.348 --> 1:00:44.557
It's freshly caught.

1:00:47.685 --> 1:00:48.853
<i>Freesia?</i>

1:00:49.479 --> 1:00:50.772
<i>It's a spring flower.</i>

1:00:51.147 --> 1:00:52.690
<i>It's your favorite flower.</i>

1:00:54.817 --> 1:00:55.860
<i>Tulip.</i>

1:00:57.153 --> 1:00:58.905
<i>This wouldn't be available now either.</i>

1:01:00.198 --> 1:01:02.158
<i>There's nothing I can't get you.</i>

1:01:44.909 --> 1:01:45.785
Yes?

1:01:47.995 --> 1:01:50.957
<i>Isn't Ha-dong cherry blossom oyster</i>
<i>too much to ask for this late?</i>

1:01:51.541 --> 1:01:54.127
<i>I didn't even know such a thing existed</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

1:01:55.461 --> 1:01:57.004
I didn't know either.

1:01:58.089 --> 1:01:59.173
I searched online.

1:02:00.091 --> 1:02:01.968
They said you can't get that in fall.

1:02:02.677 --> 1:02:04.595
You should've asked me
for a star.

1:02:05.471 --> 1:02:07.140
The thought did cross my mind.

1:02:11.644 --> 1:02:16.023
You know back on the subway when we met?

1:02:17.108 --> 1:02:18.443
The Namyeong accident.

1:02:19.444 --> 1:02:20.445
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:02:21.237 --> 1:02:24.365
I had been...

1:02:24.991 --> 1:02:27.118
forced me to go somewhere with my parents.

1:02:28.536 --> 1:02:29.996
A charity food thing.

1:02:36.002 --> 1:02:41.340
I heard that they managed Happiness
when they were alive.

1:02:44.343 --> 1:02:47.472
It wasn't managing, really.
It was only a few people.

1:02:49.140 --> 1:02:53.269
Anyway, I was dragged there
once or twice a month.

1:02:55.271 --> 1:02:59.150
That day, my dad was asking me
to help him clean up after the event.

1:03:01.110 --> 1:03:02.737
I happened to run into you.

1:03:04.238 --> 1:03:07.116
I followed you out
because I didn't want to work.

1:03:07.909 --> 1:03:09.035
Let's get off and check.

1:03:16.334 --> 1:03:17.251
Fine. I'll get off.

1:03:17.335 --> 1:03:19.587
I'll confirm it for you.
Do you think I'm scared?

1:03:21.255 --> 1:03:22.215
Where are you going?

1:03:28.137 --> 1:03:31.098
They called after me, but I ran away.

1:03:33.559 --> 1:03:35.061
It's not your fault.

1:03:36.771 --> 1:03:39.398
Of course not, but...

1:03:40.691 --> 1:03:42.443
from my parent's point of view...

1:03:42.777 --> 1:03:43.611
No.

1:03:44.821 --> 1:03:47.907
So-joon, don't talk. It's okay.

1:03:48.324 --> 1:03:49.951
From my parent's point of view...

1:03:51.702 --> 1:03:53.204
the last time they saw me...

1:03:54.914 --> 1:03:57.041
I was running off like an immature child.

1:03:58.918 --> 1:04:00.044
Their life ended...

1:04:01.754 --> 1:04:03.464
with disappointment in me.

1:04:11.514 --> 1:04:14.934
I still don't like to think
about that day.

1:04:15.601 --> 1:04:17.019
I don't like to bring it up.

1:04:21.566 --> 1:04:22.650
After that day...

1:04:24.777 --> 1:04:26.737
a lot has happened to me.

1:04:33.411 --> 1:04:35.079
Can't we just meet up for now?

1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:39.292
Can I... go to you now?

1:04:41.961 --> 1:04:42.837
Come quickly.

1:04:45.006 --> 1:04:46.257
<i>What should I bring you?</i>

1:04:47.466 --> 1:04:48.342
No.

1:04:49.260 --> 1:04:50.678
Just come straight here.

1:04:52.513 --> 1:04:53.347
<i>I...</i>

1:04:55.141 --> 1:04:57.310
might not be able to say this
to your face,

1:04:57.518 --> 1:04:58.728
so I'm saying it now.

1:05:00.938 --> 1:05:02.106
Long ago...

1:05:04.066 --> 1:05:08.446
when you said you were glad...

1:05:11.407 --> 1:05:13.993
that I survived with you...

1:05:15.411 --> 1:05:16.871
I was grateful to hear that.

1:06:36.701 --> 1:06:37.743
Song Ma-rin.

1:07:49.231 --> 1:07:52.276
<i>It feels like you and I have been reborn.</i>

1:07:52.359 --> 1:07:55.446
<i>Do you think we'll be happy tomorrow</i>
<i>like we are today?</i>

1:07:55.529 --> 1:07:58.115
Don't forget
I said this is an opportunity.

1:07:58.199 --> 1:08:00.493
<i>I'm going to make sure</i>
<i>I don't have any regrets.</i>

1:08:00.910 --> 1:08:03.788
<i>So-joon can't know about this.</i>

1:08:04.413 --> 1:08:06.791
<i>You found out everything.</i>

1:08:07.666 --> 1:08:10.086
<i>We were never supposed to meet.</i>

1:08:10.586 --> 1:08:12.671
<i>End things with me as soon as possible.</i>

1:08:12.755 --> 1:08:15.216
<i>Put my life back</i>
<i>the way it was supposed to be.</i>

1:08:18.844 --> 1:08:20.846
