00:22.157 --> 00:24.740
Rose, there's no fighting it.

00:26.099 --> 00:28.288
You will do what I want.

00:28.323 --> 00:30.233
I'll never help you.

00:30.268 --> 00:32.144
Tough talk, bitch.

00:33.389 --> 00:34.389
Feisty.

00:36.939 --> 00:39.993
The only way to save your mother

00:40.028 --> 00:43.445
is for you to give yourself to me freely.

00:45.059 --> 00:46.573
What do you mean?

00:46.608 --> 00:48.717
If you do that and your
powers transfer to me,

00:48.752 --> 00:51.050
and I'll let your mother go.

00:55.659 --> 00:56.492
Fine.

00:57.468 --> 00:59.376
How do we do this?

00:59.411 --> 01:01.744
Through our sexual energy.

01:09.307 --> 01:10.140
Okay.

01:13.189 --> 01:14.369
Thank you, Sharon.

01:14.404 --> 01:15.549
That will be all now.

01:15.584 --> 01:16.966
But I thought...

01:18.341 --> 01:19.424
You may go.

01:24.762 --> 01:26.929
Please, my dear, continue.

02:11.856 --> 02:12.856
You ready?

02:31.153 --> 02:33.958
Tara.

02:33.993 --> 02:36.992
Tara, come back to the yoga studio!

02:37.027 --> 02:39.492
You must return to the studio!

02:41.782 --> 02:44.782
Tara, you must return to the studio.

02:46.472 --> 02:48.305
Tara, Tara, come back.

02:50.822 --> 02:54.161
You must return to the yoga studio.

02:54.196 --> 02:57.501
You have to come back immediately.

02:57.536 --> 02:59.498
Sharon, I'm right here.

02:59.533 --> 03:01.152
I told you to leave.

03:01.187 --> 03:02.499
Yeah, well, I didn't.

03:02.534 --> 03:04.501
What the hell's going on?

03:04.536 --> 03:06.468
I saw the cops go inside.

03:06.503 --> 03:07.635
Come inside.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.323
Hold it right there.

03:13.358 --> 03:15.040
You gotta be kidding me.

03:15.075 --> 03:16.723
Who let these two idiots in?

03:16.758 --> 03:17.898
It wasn't me!

03:17.933 --> 03:18.968
Well, you take care of it.

03:19.003 --> 03:20.894
I have to complete the ceremony!

03:20.929 --> 03:22.392
That's on you, buddy.

03:25.272 --> 03:27.203
Take a look at her.

03:33.116 --> 03:36.866
Mortal pleasure
certainly has its benefits.

03:42.522 --> 03:43.939
Got one.

03:46.700 --> 03:49.783
I'm gonna have to speed this along.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.193
Come on, bring it, copper.

04:12.953 --> 04:13.786
Nice!

04:14.782 --> 04:15.949
But he's mine.

04:17.033 --> 04:20.572
Samael, angel of death, I command you.

04:20.608 --> 04:24.113
You command nothing, you cockroach.

04:29.929 --> 04:31.096
Will!

04:34.337 --> 04:35.298
My god, Sharon.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.212
What's going on?

04:36.247 --> 04:37.057
It's a battle.

04:37.092 --> 04:38.528
They need our energy, Tara.

04:38.563 --> 04:39.554
Who needs our energy?

04:39.589 --> 04:41.045
There's no time to explain.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.913
All that I need you to do is obey.

04:46.968 --> 04:48.704
Nice try, angel.

04:48.739 --> 04:52.171
That's archangel to
you, monkey boy.

04:52.206 --> 04:55.589
First, I'm cockroach,
and now I'm monkey boy?

04:55.624 --> 04:59.239
Looks like I'm moving up in the world.

05:03.264 --> 05:07.243
Sex magic is the most powerful magic,

05:07.278 --> 05:08.743
created to create.

05:09.923 --> 05:13.590
The earth has bestowed
upon us erotic magic,

05:15.493 --> 05:19.660
and we must use that to vanquish
the forces of the mundane.

05:21.795 --> 05:23.923
Create with me, Tara.

05:23.958 --> 05:24.756
Yes.

05:40.824 --> 05:43.058
Give yourself to me, Tara.

05:43.093 --> 05:46.343
Give yourself with the power to create.

05:49.161 --> 05:50.358
Harder!

05:50.393 --> 05:51.556
Harder!

05:58.673 --> 06:00.506
Is that all you got?

06:03.173 --> 06:06.003
Leave now or the mother dies.

06:06.038 --> 06:07.535
Will, let's...

06:07.570 --> 06:09.032
No, it ends here!

06:09.067 --> 06:10.199
Your choice.

06:14.492 --> 06:15.325
Mom!

06:24.614 --> 06:28.114
I can take it.

06:31.380 --> 06:32.213
Do it!

06:41.881 --> 06:42.881
Do it, Rose!

07:13.293 --> 07:15.629
Did we just help Rose kill Samuel?

07:15.664 --> 07:16.462
No.

07:18.192 --> 07:20.192
We tried to save Samuel.

07:21.482 --> 07:24.988
But he was corrupted
by the forces of evil,

07:25.023 --> 07:29.338
and Rose rightfully
vanquished him from our coven.

07:29.373 --> 07:33.653
Now we must protect rose
with everything we have.

07:33.688 --> 07:36.570
She's very fragile but very useful.

07:37.752 --> 07:39.021
Yes.

07:48.175 --> 07:49.623
What are you two doing here?

07:49.658 --> 07:51.374
We're here to get Rose.

07:51.409 --> 07:52.801
Who are you?

07:52.836 --> 07:54.158
I'm a friend.

07:54.193 --> 07:56.433
What's going on around here?

07:56.468 --> 07:57.498
I don't know.

07:57.533 --> 07:59.848
It was just supposed to be a meeting

07:59.883 --> 08:02.164
with our coven elders, that's all.

08:02.199 --> 08:02.997
Really?

08:03.873 --> 08:05.900
Yeah, as far as I know.

08:05.935 --> 08:08.153
That's not at all what's
been going on around here.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.500
What do you mean?

08:09.535 --> 08:11.844
Your fearless leader
tried to raise Samael,

08:11.879 --> 08:13.783
the archangel of death, tonight.

08:13.818 --> 08:15.016
What?

08:15.051 --> 08:16.049
No.

08:16.084 --> 08:17.013
Yeah.

08:17.048 --> 08:18.951
This studio, it's supposed to be

08:18.986 --> 08:20.820
a place for white magic only,

08:20.855 --> 08:25.623
where witches and warlocks
can practice craft in safety.

08:25.658 --> 08:29.383
I had no idea that Samuel
was into anything else.

08:29.418 --> 08:30.216
I swear.

08:31.100 --> 08:31.933
Rose!

08:32.873 --> 08:35.102
Rose, I'm so sorry.

08:35.138 --> 08:36.270
I had no idea.

08:37.503 --> 08:39.339
Are you okay?

08:39.374 --> 08:41.140
I think so.

08:41.174 --> 08:43.222
Ladies, you wanna do us a favor?

08:43.258 --> 08:44.182
Sure.

08:44.217 --> 08:45.071
Good.

08:45.106 --> 08:47.574
Don't tell anybody we were here.

08:47.609 --> 08:48.598
Why?

08:48.633 --> 08:50.695
Because I don't wanna
have to do the paperwork.

08:50.730 --> 08:51.528
Come on.

08:57.113 --> 08:58.748
I'll tell you what.

08:58.783 --> 09:00.449
Why don't you ladies just keep this open

09:00.484 --> 09:05.044
and run it like it should
be ran, white magic only.

09:05.079 --> 09:05.877
Deal?

09:08.924 --> 09:09.757
Deal.

09:10.660 --> 09:12.484
Okay, good luck.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.308
Come on, Tara.

11:55.990 --> 11:56.823
Hello?

11:58.396 --> 11:59.229
Yes.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.133
Of course.

12:07.558 --> 12:09.014
Thank you.

12:09.049 --> 12:13.216
I'm very honored to be
serving the coven in this way.

12:14.149 --> 12:16.316
Well, it's been difficult.

12:17.669 --> 12:22.030
We're rebuilding ever since
that mess with Samuel.

12:22.065 --> 12:23.863
There's some progress.

12:24.700 --> 12:28.867
We have one student who's
showing incredibly high hopes.

12:30.809 --> 12:33.198
She's a little skittish
concerning all that's gone on,

12:33.233 --> 12:35.615
but she's specially powerful.

12:39.070 --> 12:40.153
Are you sure?

12:43.169 --> 12:45.035
I understand.

12:45.070 --> 12:46.969
Yes, sometimes things do need to be done

12:47.004 --> 12:48.719
for the greater good.

12:51.609 --> 12:54.942
I'm uncertain as to if she'll cooperate.

12:55.790 --> 12:58.958
She doesn't really understand
how the coven functions.

12:58.993 --> 13:02.843
I'll try to use my powers of persuasion.

13:02.878 --> 13:06.900
Into the light, out of the
darkness, Aradia be praised.

13:06.935 --> 13:07.983
Goodbye, sir.

13:11.030 --> 13:13.545
Okay, it looks like all
the yoga mats are cleaned,

13:13.580 --> 13:15.918
bathrooms cleaned, studio floors swept,

13:15.953 --> 13:17.771
and vending machines stocked.

13:17.806 --> 13:19.777
You want me to get started
on the website now?

13:19.812 --> 13:21.748
Seriously, I can't even
look at the homepage.

13:21.783 --> 13:23.382
It's so ugly.

13:23.417 --> 13:25.727
How are we supposed to rebuild the coven

13:25.762 --> 13:28.002
without an effective internet presence?

13:28.037 --> 13:32.318
Aradia be praised,
you're doing a great job.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.543
I have to admit.

13:33.578 --> 13:34.734
I'm pretty amazing.

13:36.838 --> 13:40.446
And I totally want to get
into that website today.

13:40.481 --> 13:42.414
But first, I need you to go grab Rose.

13:42.449 --> 13:44.313
I need her in the office for something.

13:44.348 --> 13:47.148
Teacher's pet getting
called into the office.

13:47.183 --> 13:49.051
Now, stop it.

13:49.086 --> 13:52.606
I love you all equally, but
Rose has certain abilities

13:52.641 --> 13:55.566
that the coven needs to
take advantage of today.

13:55.601 --> 13:56.364
Gotcha.

13:56.399 --> 13:57.326
I'll text her now.

13:57.361 --> 13:58.326
Thank you.

13:59.597 --> 14:01.251
Aradia be praised.

14:01.286 --> 14:03.953
Aradia be praised, absolutely.

14:29.332 --> 14:30.265
Damn it!

14:30.300 --> 14:33.860
Magic, M-A-G-I-C.

14:33.895 --> 14:34.693
Yes.

14:36.300 --> 14:37.337
Damn it!

14:37.372 --> 14:39.580
Fuck, my spelling is for shit.

14:39.615 --> 14:41.530
Hey, I got your text.

14:41.565 --> 14:42.577
What's up?

14:42.612 --> 14:44.580
Girl, you would not
believe the day I'm having.

14:44.615 --> 14:46.932
Spoiler, it sucks being a dyslexic witch.

14:46.967 --> 14:49.250
So you texted me to come help you spell?

14:49.285 --> 14:50.256
No, smart ass.

14:50.291 --> 14:51.656
Sharon wants to see you.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.171
Something's brewing,
but she didn't say what.

14:56.132 --> 14:57.256
Dude, come on.

14:57.291 --> 14:58.345
She's cool.

14:58.380 --> 14:59.641
The whole thing's cool.

14:59.676 --> 15:00.825
How so?

15:00.860 --> 15:03.292
She wasn't the one that
tried to sacrifice you.

15:03.327 --> 15:04.705
She didn't kill your mom.

15:04.740 --> 15:06.977
That was all Samuel, the warlock dick.

15:07.012 --> 15:07.931
It will be fine.

15:07.966 --> 15:09.213
I promise.

15:09.248 --> 15:10.425
I guess.

15:10.460 --> 15:12.241
It's just gonna take some time.

15:12.276 --> 15:13.545
I get it, trust.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.770
Just know I always have your back.

15:14.805 --> 15:15.797
Cool?

15:15.832 --> 15:16.755
Cool.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.235
Punch it in.

15:18.270 --> 15:20.177
Aradia be praised.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.692
I guess I should get back there.

15:21.727 --> 15:22.732
See you at home later?

15:22.767 --> 15:23.815
Guaranteed.

15:26.617 --> 15:29.200
Okay, seriously, do my bidding.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.013
Damn it!

15:34.211 --> 15:35.595
Hi, Sharon.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.540
Tara said you wanted to see me.

15:37.575 --> 15:39.406
Hey, Rose.

15:39.441 --> 15:41.146
Come over here.

15:41.181 --> 15:42.816
Aradia be praised.

15:42.851 --> 15:45.131
How is my favorite student?

15:45.166 --> 15:46.662
I'm your favorite?

15:46.697 --> 15:50.864
Well, don't tell Tara or any
of the others that, but yes.

15:53.627 --> 15:55.406
And why is that?

15:55.441 --> 15:57.185
Don't be so coy.

15:58.153 --> 16:00.998
You're a very powerful woman.

16:01.033 --> 16:03.972
You're probably gonna be sitting
behind that desk one day,

16:04.007 --> 16:06.302
running this branch of the coven.

16:06.337 --> 16:08.598
Isn't that something you want?

16:08.633 --> 16:10.417
I don't know what I want.

16:10.452 --> 16:12.362
Do I have to choose now?

16:12.397 --> 16:14.238
Of course, you don't.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.952
I'm sorry if I seemed a little bit pushy.

16:16.987 --> 16:19.430
I'm so excited for you.

16:19.465 --> 16:21.838
I know, and I'm grateful

16:21.873 --> 16:23.972
for everything you've done for me.

16:24.007 --> 16:25.517
I'm glad to hear it.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.142
Well, are you ready for our lesson today?

16:28.177 --> 16:29.027
Now?

16:29.062 --> 16:31.452
I thought we weren't
starting till tomorrow.

16:31.487 --> 16:33.033
I've been told we need to speed up

16:33.068 --> 16:35.223
your training a little bit.

16:35.258 --> 16:37.378
There are, how do I say this,

16:38.878 --> 16:43.157
some forces that could
potentially harm the coven,

16:43.192 --> 16:47.982
and we need everyone in tiptop
shape as soon as possible.

16:48.017 --> 16:49.364
It's just that...

16:49.399 --> 16:51.816
Now, don't make me beg.

16:53.692 --> 16:54.525
Sad witch.

16:55.472 --> 16:58.969
Okay, okay, I'll do it,
just stop making that face.

16:59.004 --> 16:59.767
All right.

16:59.802 --> 17:01.476
Let's sit down on the yoga mat,

17:01.511 --> 17:04.928
you in front of me, facing the other way.

17:08.761 --> 17:12.011
Okay, slowly put your head into my lap.

17:13.001 --> 17:13.917
Easy, easy.

17:17.342 --> 17:19.342
Focus on your breathing.

17:27.182 --> 17:31.349
Now let me enter you,
guiding you from the inside.

17:34.662 --> 17:36.995
Yes, yes.

17:38.079 --> 17:38.912
Let me in.

17:41.780 --> 17:44.470
Wait,
what are you doing?

17:44.505 --> 17:46.934
Just relax.

17:46.969 --> 17:49.302
Let me slide into your mind.

17:51.209 --> 17:52.475
This feels strange.

17:52.510 --> 17:54.927
I feel like I'm disappearing.

17:58.231 --> 18:01.148
Let it happen.

18:02.006 --> 18:04.506
Sharon, no!

18:05.417 --> 18:08.523
Move aside!

18:08.558 --> 18:09.927
Big papa to little mama.

18:09.962 --> 18:11.600
Big papa to little mama.

18:11.635 --> 18:13.238
The bird is in the nest.

18:13.273 --> 18:14.433
Hey, Lutz, relax.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.702
Hey, I got a great joke.

18:15.737 --> 18:17.686
Have you heard of the serial prostitute?

18:17.721 --> 18:19.988
They don't snap, crackle, pop.

18:20.023 --> 18:22.255
They just lay there and bang.

18:22.290 --> 18:24.206
Shit, I crack myself up.

18:24.241 --> 18:27.153
Little mama, we've got
one of our regulars.

18:27.188 --> 18:28.457
Damn it, Eden.

18:28.492 --> 18:32.409
Don't make me have to go
in there and bust you.

20:49.432 --> 20:50.515
Get on top.

21:00.548 --> 21:01.715
You like that?

21:07.608 --> 21:09.405
Don't you stop.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.156
That's what you pay me for.

21:11.191 --> 21:12.872
Who said I was paying you?

21:12.907 --> 21:13.705
What?

21:18.952 --> 21:21.794
Slap me.

21:21.829 --> 21:23.958
Yeah!

21:23.993 --> 21:26.087
Fuck me!

21:29.644 --> 21:30.561
Sharon, no!

21:31.553 --> 21:33.136
It's Eden, dummy!

21:35.892 --> 21:37.918
Hell's brought you to Eden.

21:37.953 --> 21:40.870
You will serve the house of Aradia.

21:43.484 --> 21:45.583
You are a vessel.

21:45.618 --> 21:47.683
You are a conduit.

21:49.823 --> 21:52.240
Death shall be your offering.

21:59.471 --> 22:00.655
My god.

22:00.690 --> 22:02.607
I'm getting outta here.

22:25.118 --> 22:26.313
Break it up, y'all two.

22:26.348 --> 22:27.711
I thought I told you if
I was gonna catch you

22:27.746 --> 22:29.150
on the job again, I was gonna take you in.

22:29.185 --> 22:30.554
Three strikes, you're out, young lady.

22:30.589 --> 22:32.004
What the hell's going on here?

22:32.039 --> 22:33.021
I didn't do this.

22:33.056 --> 22:34.289
This is not me.

22:34.324 --> 22:35.488
I did not do this.

22:35.523 --> 22:36.452
Hands up where I can see 'em.

22:36.487 --> 22:37.348
Is anyone else in here?

22:37.383 --> 22:38.216
Answer me, is anyone else in here?

22:38.251 --> 22:40.466
No, I'm by myself.

22:41.593 --> 22:43.389
Start talking.

22:43.424 --> 22:44.869
We were making love,

22:44.904 --> 22:47.839
and then blood came all over his face.

22:47.874 --> 22:50.088
And he started talking
crazy and jumping around.

22:50.123 --> 22:52.555
And I don't know what
happened, but I didn't do this.

22:52.590 --> 22:54.464
So you're telling
me you didn't off him.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.818
I just said I didn't do it.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.955
I fucked this guy for
money, and that's it.

22:58.990 --> 22:59.869
I did not kill him.

22:59.904 --> 23:01.856
Put your
hands behind your back.

23:01.891 --> 23:04.301
Are you fucking kidding me?

23:04.336 --> 23:06.635
My god, can I at
least get dressed first?

23:06.670 --> 23:08.193
Yeah, go ahead.

23:08.228 --> 23:09.860
My god.

23:15.093 --> 23:16.760
Aradia be praised.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.957
Tara, can you come in here, sweetheart?

23:34.399 --> 23:36.662
What happened in here?

23:36.697 --> 23:39.209
We had a super intense training session.

23:39.244 --> 23:41.534
Poor thing's wiped out.

23:41.569 --> 23:44.689
Could you help Rose up
and take her back home?

23:44.724 --> 23:45.622
Absolutely.

23:45.657 --> 23:46.520
Hey, girl.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.325
What happened?

23:53.360 --> 23:56.193
Let's get you home, okay?

24:02.571 --> 24:03.571
It's done.

24:05.453 --> 24:06.953
Aradia be praised.

24:37.406 --> 24:39.989
You were conceived in darkness,

24:44.416 --> 24:46.583
a child of three monsters,

24:48.856 --> 24:52.273
of earthly loins to serve a higher plane.

25:04.654 --> 25:08.821
This is your destiny.

25:14.049 --> 25:16.464
Open yourself to it.

25:16.499 --> 25:17.631
Open yourself.

26:08.975 --> 26:09.891
Hey, lazy.

26:09.926 --> 26:11.895
Those spells aren't gonna cast themselves.

26:11.930 --> 26:13.116
Better get out of bed.

26:13.151 --> 26:14.116
Hilarious.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.318
Thanks.

26:19.353 --> 26:21.673
So what happened in there?

26:21.708 --> 26:23.980
I don't really know.

26:24.015 --> 26:27.665
She said she wanted to
guide me from the inside.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.969
Guide you from the inside?

26:30.004 --> 26:32.215
Sounds pretty lesbotronic to me.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.420
Yeah.

26:33.455 --> 26:36.033
I don't really remember much after that.

26:36.068 --> 26:38.516
We sat down, and it felt like

26:38.551 --> 26:41.460
someone was slipping into my mind,

26:41.495 --> 26:45.662
like Sharon was wearing me or
something, then I blacked out.

26:46.684 --> 26:48.060
Sounds really weird.

26:48.095 --> 26:50.124
We've been working on some
mind control stuff lately

26:50.159 --> 26:52.149
but nothing that intense.

26:52.184 --> 26:55.180
The only thing I remember
is that there was a man

26:55.215 --> 26:59.604
and a girl, and he started
bleeding from his eyes and mouth.

26:59.639 --> 27:02.075
And it felt like I was killing him.

27:02.110 --> 27:04.476
To be fair, you've done it before.

27:04.511 --> 27:06.550
Yeah, but I have that under control now.

27:06.585 --> 27:09.655
There's no way I'd just
kill someone like that.

27:09.690 --> 27:10.453
I don't know.

27:10.488 --> 27:11.904
Maybe it was just a dream.

27:11.939 --> 27:12.737
Maybe.

27:14.865 --> 27:17.934
Although I did have a weird vision.

27:17.969 --> 27:21.004
I think I saw myself being conceived.

27:21.039 --> 27:22.984
Like your parents having sex?

27:23.911 --> 27:25.729
I know!

27:25.764 --> 27:29.931
But the thing is they didn't
look like my parents at all.

27:30.964 --> 27:33.069
Can I tell you how much I love living

27:33.104 --> 27:35.175
in our little witchy sorority together?

27:35.210 --> 27:38.175
Well, actually, it's my house, so.

27:39.225 --> 27:43.705
And how much I just
love my witch sisters.

27:43.740 --> 27:45.162
What do you want, Danielle?

27:45.197 --> 27:46.550
Why do I have to want anything?

27:46.585 --> 27:49.345
Can't I just love my witch
sisters unconditionally?

27:49.380 --> 27:52.445
You know we've met you, right?

27:52.480 --> 27:53.252
Fine.

27:53.287 --> 27:54.487
I need you guys to clear out later.

27:54.522 --> 27:56.281
My boyfriend's coming over.

27:56.316 --> 27:58.868
Clear out of my own house again?

27:58.903 --> 27:59.666
Yes.

27:59.701 --> 28:01.201
Not gonna happen.

28:01.236 --> 28:02.972
But he gets weirded
out when you're here.

28:03.007 --> 28:04.708
He can't get it up when
he knows someone else

28:04.743 --> 28:05.792
is in the house.

28:05.827 --> 28:07.068
Girl, go to his house.

28:07.103 --> 28:07.866
I can't.

28:07.901 --> 28:09.484
He has roommates and he shares a room

28:09.519 --> 28:11.033
with one of them, and it's gross.

28:11.068 --> 28:14.034
This sounds like a problem
with a very simple solution.

28:14.069 --> 28:14.841
You leaving?

28:14.876 --> 28:17.707
No, you leaving to his house.

28:17.742 --> 28:19.107
But I'll pay you.

28:19.142 --> 28:19.940
No.

28:22.877 --> 28:24.692
I hate it here.

28:24.727 --> 28:27.636
Why does Sharon make me live
with you two fun killers?

28:27.671 --> 28:31.087
You can always go back to the YWCA.

28:31.122 --> 28:33.428
Shut up!

28:36.041 --> 28:38.046
Okay, one more time

28:38.081 --> 28:41.023
because I love a good bullshit story.

28:41.058 --> 28:44.798
My god, I am no bulshitting you.

28:44.833 --> 28:49.081
I got a call from my agency
for a date at that hotel,

28:49.116 --> 28:50.909
some guy named Jamal.

28:50.944 --> 28:52.668
He paid for the room.

28:52.703 --> 28:55.148
He wanted sex with a
little bit of rough stuff.

28:55.183 --> 28:57.872
He's in the middle of strangling
me, and he started bleeding

28:57.907 --> 29:01.103
all over the place and turned
into Linda fucking Blair.

29:01.138 --> 29:02.270
And?

29:03.201 --> 29:04.517
And that's it.

29:04.552 --> 29:07.441
And then your boyfriend here
came in and arrested me.

29:07.476 --> 29:09.919
And here we all are, happily ever other,

29:09.954 --> 29:12.097
and can I please fucking go now.

29:12.132 --> 29:13.632
The chances of you
walking out of here tonight

29:13.667 --> 29:15.278
are approximately zero.

29:15.313 --> 29:18.242
You're gonna be charged with
murder unless you can come up

29:18.277 --> 29:21.172
with a better story, and I
know you can't afford bail.

29:21.207 --> 29:22.697
My god.

29:22.732 --> 29:26.513
I booked a gig on It's
Always Sunny for next week.

29:26.548 --> 29:28.543
Why in the world would I kill some rando

29:28.578 --> 29:30.673
just as my career is taking off?

29:30.708 --> 29:31.868
That's a great question,

29:31.903 --> 29:34.759
and I look forward to hearing your answer.

29:34.794 --> 29:35.708
Let's go.

29:35.743 --> 29:38.410
I'm gonna take you into booking.

29:43.959 --> 29:45.001
Have fun.

29:45.036 --> 29:48.453
You guys are worse than my manager.

29:51.907 --> 29:52.740
Jesus.

29:53.627 --> 29:54.638
Hardly!

29:54.673 --> 29:55.614
Shit!

29:55.649 --> 29:57.563
Damn it, Spanner!

29:57.598 --> 29:59.592
Don't sneak up on me like that.

29:59.627 --> 30:02.418
You're lucky my gun wasn't unholstered.

30:02.453 --> 30:03.864
And why is that?

30:03.899 --> 30:05.738
Because you'd be dead by now.

30:05.773 --> 30:06.536
I tried that once.

30:06.571 --> 30:08.344
It just isn't my style.

30:08.379 --> 30:10.952
God, I hate a warlock
with a sense of humor.

30:10.987 --> 30:14.747
I heard you got a problem
and you needed my expertise.

30:14.782 --> 30:17.458
Good news travels fast, I see.

30:17.493 --> 30:18.832
Yes.

30:18.867 --> 30:20.617
Take a look at these.

30:22.318 --> 30:24.624
Died underneath a prostitute.

30:24.659 --> 30:26.778
Not a bad way to go if
you don't count the part

30:26.813 --> 30:29.535
where he bled out through his eyeballs.

30:29.570 --> 30:32.678
Looks like a
dark forces kill to me.

30:32.713 --> 30:35.752
Kind of a showy way to off someone.

30:35.787 --> 30:38.918
I mean high traffic area,
and it's not exactly a secret

30:38.953 --> 30:42.366
that cops bust hookers
there a dozen times a day.

30:42.401 --> 30:45.494
My guess is that they
wanted the body discovered.

30:45.529 --> 30:48.587
Do you think somebody's
trying to send a signal?

30:48.622 --> 30:49.670
Absolutely.

30:50.619 --> 30:51.454
Well, well, well,

30:51.489 --> 30:54.116
if it's not mister sunshine and rainbows.

30:54.151 --> 30:55.694
Detective.

30:55.729 --> 31:00.710
How are your spider senses
now with your dead dear John?

31:00.745 --> 31:02.144
My guess is that he committed

31:02.179 --> 31:04.669
a heretical act against the coven.

31:04.704 --> 31:06.083
Heretical act as in?

31:06.118 --> 31:08.951
As in he really pissed them off.

31:12.809 --> 31:16.432
And as we begin to align ourselves,

31:16.467 --> 31:19.800
stacking our chakras from crown to root,

31:22.690 --> 31:26.630
we begin to align
ourselves with white magic,

31:26.665 --> 31:27.797
and the earth,

31:29.400 --> 31:30.317
and Aradia.

31:32.347 --> 31:34.413
And then we can truly become

31:34.448 --> 31:37.615
a pure vessel for power and influence.

31:42.279 --> 31:44.946
Now let's put our palms together

31:46.789 --> 31:47.622
and bow.

31:50.589 --> 31:53.955
Into the light and out of the darkness.

31:53.990 --> 31:57.321
Into the light
and out of the darkness.

31:57.356 --> 32:00.142
All right, great work today, guys.

32:00.177 --> 32:02.929
Great things are on the horizon.

32:04.073 --> 32:08.240
Now remember to keep on
practicing in between classes.

32:09.205 --> 32:11.662
And I will see you all
again next Thursday.

32:11.697 --> 32:12.635
Make sure to check with Tara

32:12.670 --> 32:15.837
with all of your schedules, all right?

32:26.334 --> 32:28.501
Sharon, we have company.

32:30.356 --> 32:33.104
Will Spanner, I presume.

32:33.139 --> 32:35.817
Nice to see you again.

32:35.852 --> 32:37.933
Are you interested in our special?

32:37.968 --> 32:40.256
10 classes for the price of eight.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.510
My back would never forgive me.

32:42.545 --> 32:44.756
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

32:44.791 --> 32:46.423
It's very important.

32:48.336 --> 32:50.306
Tara, can you give us a minute?

32:50.341 --> 32:51.139
Sure.

32:54.396 --> 32:56.441
What is it now, Will Spanner?

32:56.476 --> 32:59.797
Did the LAPD send you over
here to harass my school?

32:59.832 --> 33:02.380
What do you think about this?

33:04.525 --> 33:05.608
My god.

33:07.436 --> 33:09.245
That's gruesome.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.078
It is.

33:21.359 --> 33:25.968
If you're implying that I
have anything to do with this,

33:26.003 --> 33:27.968
your powers are failing.

33:29.110 --> 33:33.795
That sort of retaliatory
tactic died with Samuel.

33:33.830 --> 33:37.019
Who said this had to do with
anything about retaliation?

33:37.054 --> 33:39.315
This is right up Samuel's alley.

33:39.350 --> 33:42.440
Since he's left and now, you're in charge,

33:42.475 --> 33:45.726
this is gonna be my first stop.

33:45.761 --> 33:47.355
I told you.

33:47.390 --> 33:48.807
I'm not involved.

33:50.990 --> 33:54.054
We have a witness,
and she's ready to talk.

33:54.089 --> 33:57.119
If she so much as nods
towards this studio,

33:57.154 --> 34:00.493
you and I are gonna have a big problem.

34:00.528 --> 34:04.695
Well, until then, get your
street shoes off my yoga mat.

34:06.126 --> 34:08.277
And tell your detective friends

34:08.313 --> 34:10.395
the next time they wanna stop by,

34:10.429 --> 34:14.597
they're going to either need
a warrant or a yoga mat.

34:16.406 --> 34:17.906
Aradia be praised.

34:31.210 --> 34:32.964
Hey, Tara, what's up?

34:32.998 --> 34:34.263
Remember that Spanner guy,

34:34.297 --> 34:36.650
the one that helped you
kill Samuel and everything?

34:36.685 --> 34:37.850
He's back.

34:37.885 --> 34:38.699
What?

34:38.735 --> 34:39.481
Why?

34:39.516 --> 34:41.775
He walked in on Sharon's
newbie class asking questions

34:41.810 --> 34:45.148
about some gruesome murder that
has witchcraft all over it.

34:45.183 --> 34:46.513
She denied it, of course,

34:46.547 --> 34:48.896
but Spanner seems to think she's in on it.

34:48.931 --> 34:49.844
My god.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.978
Is that what she used me for?

34:52.013 --> 34:53.145
You tell me.

34:54.530 --> 34:55.978
Tara, can you have her come

34:56.014 --> 34:57.382
to Sharon's office this afternoon?

34:57.417 --> 35:00.566
She wants another
private session with her.

35:00.601 --> 35:01.649
You got it.

35:03.267 --> 35:04.527
Did you hear that?

35:04.562 --> 35:06.020
You've been summoned.

35:06.055 --> 35:07.478
I really don't trust her.

35:07.513 --> 35:08.276
I know.

35:08.311 --> 35:09.152
Just play along.

35:09.187 --> 35:11.423
If we find out she's really using you

35:11.458 --> 35:13.659
for something terrible, we'll both bolt.

35:19.986 --> 35:21.911
Spanner here.

35:21.946 --> 35:25.517
Yeah, I think I was wrong
about that Jamal kid.

35:25.552 --> 35:29.061
But I think the studio's involved.

35:29.096 --> 35:33.263
I suggest you get over here
and double team Sharon.

35:42.937 --> 35:45.437
Rose, come here, sweetheart.

35:47.787 --> 35:49.956
I hope that you've fully recovered

35:49.991 --> 35:52.091
from our session the other day.

35:52.126 --> 35:56.947
I know it's probably absolutely
draining but it's worth it.

35:56.982 --> 35:59.523
I have recovered, thanks.

35:59.558 --> 36:02.067
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

36:02.102 --> 36:03.966
Well, let's sit down.

36:04.001 --> 36:04.799
Sure.

36:11.796 --> 36:13.046
I'm all ears.

36:14.538 --> 36:18.023
So I had a strange
dream the other night.

36:18.058 --> 36:22.347
I saw my parents making
love, and I heard your voice.

36:22.382 --> 36:24.472
But they didn't look like my parents.

36:24.507 --> 36:28.634
And I mean it was like
I was watching a movie.

36:28.669 --> 36:31.967
Rose, there's no easy way to say this,

36:34.948 --> 36:37.448
but I guess the time has come.

36:39.007 --> 36:41.007
Who were those people?

36:42.627 --> 36:45.393
They were your real parents.

36:45.428 --> 36:48.956
The woman that you think
is your mother, Beth,

36:48.991 --> 36:50.716
she's not your real mom.

36:50.751 --> 36:51.549
What?

36:52.388 --> 36:55.712
Beth was assigned to you by the coven.

36:55.747 --> 36:59.001
We've had our eyes on you for a while now.

36:59.036 --> 37:03.228
So the other thing I saw,
that man bleeding from his eyes,

37:03.263 --> 37:07.395
dying in the motel, that
was me, right, you and me?

37:11.396 --> 37:14.667
I'm going to admit something to you,

37:14.702 --> 37:17.938
and it's something I'm not proud of.

37:17.973 --> 37:18.771
But yes,

37:19.994 --> 37:22.577
you and me, we killed that man.

37:23.818 --> 37:24.782
Why?

37:24.817 --> 37:27.732
Because he was one
of hundreds of children

37:27.767 --> 37:31.791
that Samuel fathered over
the eons that he's been here.

37:31.826 --> 37:35.496
Just the other day, the
oracle, a seer for our coven,

37:35.531 --> 37:39.132
he contacted me and told
me that one day, that man

37:39.167 --> 37:44.026
would realize his true lineage
and try to resurrect Samuel.

37:44.061 --> 37:46.661
And that would be absolutely disastrous.

37:46.696 --> 37:48.556
Rose, it wasn't just for
the good of the coven.

37:48.591 --> 37:51.332
This was for the good of mankind.

37:51.367 --> 37:53.160
You used me.

37:53.195 --> 37:55.564
I know it's hard to understand.

37:55.599 --> 37:56.362
No, no!

37:56.397 --> 37:58.458
I won't let you do that again.

37:58.493 --> 38:01.484
I'm not letting you do it to me again.

38:01.519 --> 38:03.341
But the job isn't over.

38:03.376 --> 38:05.129
There was a girl with him.

38:05.164 --> 38:07.521
And if that girl says anything,

38:07.556 --> 38:10.631
talks to the police about
a single thing that went on

38:10.666 --> 38:13.706
in that room, not only would
it be absolute destruction

38:13.741 --> 38:16.048
for the coven, but it would,

38:16.083 --> 38:18.356
do you understand, Rose?

38:18.391 --> 38:20.175
I won't, no.

38:20.210 --> 38:21.025
Rose...

38:21.060 --> 38:21.867
No!

38:21.902 --> 38:22.639
Please!

38:22.674 --> 38:26.757
No, I won't use my power
to clean up your mess.

38:30.968 --> 38:33.711
Of course, you won't.

38:33.746 --> 38:36.455
Look who's all grown up.

38:37.906 --> 38:41.916
I can't say that I'm not
a little bit disappointed,

38:41.951 --> 38:44.375
but I'm proud of you.

38:44.410 --> 38:45.208
Proud?

38:46.436 --> 38:49.185
Well, you're standing up for yourself.

38:49.220 --> 38:51.935
One day, this coven is going to be

38:51.970 --> 38:54.102
in good hands, your hands.

38:57.567 --> 39:00.734
And I can see that now more than ever.

39:02.455 --> 39:03.955
Well, thank you.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.676
Forgive me for asking.

39:09.276 --> 39:10.502
Yes.

39:10.537 --> 39:11.728
Good.

39:12.815 --> 39:17.455
Now why don't you have a good
day with Tara and Danielle.

39:17.490 --> 39:19.786
And then tomorrow, when you return,

39:19.821 --> 39:22.756
we can resume our one-on-ones.

39:22.791 --> 39:24.506
No tricks, I promise.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.620
You understand why I
can't do this, right?

39:30.655 --> 39:32.556
I mean you know I'd do
anything for the coven but...

39:32.591 --> 39:33.740
Of course.

39:33.775 --> 39:36.807
I've been there many times.

39:36.842 --> 39:37.640
Come here.

39:44.958 --> 39:46.958
Now go, get out of here.

39:56.671 --> 40:00.754
You are the child of three
mothers, three powers,

40:02.241 --> 40:06.408
brought together from three
loins to be our powerful savior.

41:01.744 --> 41:03.077
Let me in, Rose.

41:05.104 --> 41:07.771
We could do great work together.

41:09.385 --> 41:10.885
All you have to do

41:12.184 --> 41:13.017
is let

41:13.993 --> 41:14.826
me

41:16.425 --> 41:17.258
In.

41:18.934 --> 41:19.975
No.

41:20.010 --> 41:21.017
Yes!

41:22.184 --> 41:23.041
Yes!

41:23.076 --> 41:23.898
No.

41:25.345 --> 41:26.178
Yes.

41:27.761 --> 41:30.178
Wait, what am I doing here?

41:31.435 --> 41:33.685
Sharon, what have you done?

41:41.344 --> 41:43.761
What have we done, my dear?

41:45.699 --> 41:48.239
You have no idea what
a nightmare that was.

41:48.274 --> 41:50.072
I just now got let go.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.730
I don't know, some dude paid my bail.

41:53.765 --> 41:55.105
I have no idea who it was,

41:55.140 --> 41:57.644
and I do not give a shit who it was.

41:57.679 --> 42:00.112
All they said to me
was, "Don't leave town.

42:00.147 --> 42:02.546
"We might have some
more questions for you."

42:02.581 --> 42:03.344
Fuck that shit.

42:03.379 --> 42:05.546
I am leaving town tonight.

42:06.919 --> 42:09.044
Fucking New York.

42:09.079 --> 42:11.059
I am a classically trained actress.

42:11.094 --> 42:12.809
I belong on Broadway.

43:03.171 --> 43:04.371
What the fuck is that?

43:04.406 --> 43:05.169
What?

43:05.204 --> 43:07.121
It's nothing, the wind.

43:16.201 --> 43:19.118
Now what the fuck is that?

43:21.001 --> 43:22.830
All right, fuck this.

43:22.865 --> 43:24.107
I can't.

43:24.142 --> 43:25.475
Dude, come on.

43:28.903 --> 43:30.236
What did I do?

43:34.953 --> 43:36.423
What is wrong with you?

43:36.458 --> 43:37.647
What do you mean?

43:37.682 --> 43:40.242
I mean you're all in here.

43:40.277 --> 43:42.767
I was having a nightmare.

43:42.802 --> 43:46.302
Well, your nightmares are boner killers.

43:47.401 --> 43:48.988
Hey, what's going on?

43:49.023 --> 43:50.954
Nothing with miss
nightmare on weird street,

43:50.989 --> 43:53.162
moaning like some sick animal in here.

43:53.197 --> 43:54.863
You are killing my sex life.

43:54.898 --> 43:56.773
Okay, you're banished.

43:56.808 --> 43:57.606
Out.

43:59.193 --> 44:01.594
I think Sharon used me
to kill someone again.

44:01.629 --> 44:03.228
Okay, so what's going on?

44:03.263 --> 44:06.573
I was sleeping, and she
forced herself into my mind.

44:06.608 --> 44:09.637
Again, I'll say that
sounds very lesarrific.

44:09.672 --> 44:10.802
I tried to stop her,

44:10.837 --> 44:13.417
but the next thing I
know, I have this vision

44:13.452 --> 44:15.997
of a woman covered in
blood, dead by her car.

44:16.032 --> 44:17.316
You didn't see it happen?

44:17.351 --> 44:18.114
No.

44:18.149 --> 44:21.197
And here's the weird thing,
I wasn't unconscious.

44:21.232 --> 44:22.775
I was in her office.

44:22.810 --> 44:23.761
What?

44:23.796 --> 44:26.866
I know it sounds crazy, but
it's like we switched bodies.

44:26.901 --> 44:29.004
She was in mine, using
me to kill that woman,

44:29.039 --> 44:31.391
and I was in hers just waiting there.

44:31.426 --> 44:34.597
That is some freaky
Friday shit right there.

44:34.632 --> 44:36.471
How am I gonna stop her?

44:36.506 --> 44:38.335
If she's strong enough
to take over my body,

44:38.370 --> 44:41.502
how do I keep her from using me again?

45:00.577 --> 45:04.066
Rose, I get it's silly to
think this is the same girl

45:04.101 --> 45:06.258
we rescued from a demon a month ago.

45:06.293 --> 45:08.162
It's absolutely ridiculous.

45:08.197 --> 45:10.850
And I guess going to the yoga studio

45:10.885 --> 45:13.504
to investigate is a waste of time.

45:13.539 --> 45:15.973
And taxpayers' money.

45:16.008 --> 45:18.675
It's too bad we have no leads.

45:21.628 --> 45:22.461
Yes.

45:28.664 --> 45:30.497
But she's so powerful.

45:33.954 --> 45:34.787
All right.

45:37.008 --> 45:38.508
Aradia be praised.

45:44.666 --> 45:49.523
Tara, can you have Rose come
in my office immediately?

45:49.558 --> 45:51.940
That would be a great idea.

46:00.864 --> 46:02.026
Hi.

46:02.061 --> 46:02.859
You're that detective

46:02.894 --> 46:05.176
from the yoga studio the other day, right?

46:05.211 --> 46:06.189
I am.

46:06.224 --> 46:07.307
Is Rose here?

46:07.342 --> 46:09.504
No, she just left for the studio.

46:09.539 --> 46:11.160
Okay, good.

46:11.195 --> 46:12.605
Do you mind if I come in?

46:12.640 --> 46:13.450
Go ahead.

46:13.485 --> 46:14.501
I'm Danielle, by the way.

46:14.536 --> 46:16.376
It's nice to meet you, Danielle.

46:16.411 --> 46:17.760
You must be new here, yes?

46:17.795 --> 46:19.254
Yeah, I moved in about a month ago.

46:19.289 --> 46:20.640
Sharon set it up.

46:20.675 --> 46:22.936
That Sharon, always helping.

46:22.971 --> 46:24.340
So what's going on?

46:24.375 --> 46:26.285
Are Rose and Sharon in trouble?

46:26.320 --> 46:27.770
No, not at all.

46:27.805 --> 46:31.685
It's just that, well, me
and your housemate have,

46:31.720 --> 46:33.295
you know, some relations.

46:33.330 --> 46:34.773
Hello, daddy.

46:34.808 --> 46:36.216
I had no idea.

46:36.251 --> 46:37.069
Nice.

46:37.104 --> 46:38.742
It's not like that at all.

46:39.944 --> 46:42.784
I just came here to check on
her and make sure she's okay.

46:42.819 --> 46:43.582
Cool.

46:43.617 --> 46:44.944
Can I get you something to drink?

46:44.979 --> 46:46.461
No, I'm okay right now,

46:46.496 --> 46:49.704
but I would like to take a
quick peek into your brain.

46:49.739 --> 46:51.560
What?

46:51.595 --> 46:55.595
Danielle, what's happening
at the yoga studio?

46:58.599 --> 47:00.036
What's going on?

47:00.071 --> 47:01.156
Those detectives are back.

47:01.191 --> 47:02.560
They're asking questions about some woman

47:02.595 --> 47:04.193
who was killed last night.

47:04.228 --> 47:05.791
Apparently, your name came up.

47:05.826 --> 47:07.085
God.

47:07.120 --> 47:08.556
Take a breath.

47:08.591 --> 47:10.483
If Sharon really is using you,

47:10.518 --> 47:12.560
there's nothing she can do
while the cops are here.

47:12.595 --> 47:13.953
You're right.

47:13.988 --> 47:15.276
Punch it in.

47:15.311 --> 47:16.936
Aradia be praised.

47:16.971 --> 47:18.561
Okay, I'm going in.

47:25.528 --> 47:26.361
Rose!

47:31.860 --> 47:36.460
Listen, Rose, a couple of
nights ago, there was a woman

47:36.495 --> 47:39.962
that was murdered, and they
think we're somehow involved.

47:39.997 --> 47:43.430
Well, it's a little too
early to start accusing people.

47:43.465 --> 47:45.693
We got some information from the scene,

47:45.728 --> 47:47.584
and we wanna take her in for some clarity.

47:47.619 --> 47:49.440
We'd like to take you down the station,

47:49.475 --> 47:51.357
ask you some questions.

47:52.320 --> 47:53.932
Am I under arrest?

47:53.967 --> 47:56.684
No, we're just taking
you in for questioning.

47:56.719 --> 47:59.366
Listen, they can't
hold you for more than

47:59.401 --> 48:02.664
a couple of hours without
actually arresting you.

48:02.699 --> 48:05.927
So if you're gone for too
long, I'll go grab a lawyer

48:05.962 --> 48:08.409
and I'll come down to meet you, okay?

48:08.444 --> 48:10.710
That's absolutely true.

48:10.745 --> 48:12.326
Well, okay.

48:12.361 --> 48:15.561
Listen, I want you to
tell them everything.

48:15.596 --> 48:18.761
Anything you think is
important, tell them.

48:18.796 --> 48:20.280
Don't hold back.

48:20.315 --> 48:21.397
Got it?

48:21.432 --> 48:22.826
Everything?

48:22.861 --> 48:24.220
Everything.

48:24.255 --> 48:25.235
Sure.

48:25.270 --> 48:26.770
Okay, come here.

48:28.449 --> 48:30.111
It's gonna be okay.

48:30.146 --> 48:31.773
The car's out front.

48:45.081 --> 48:47.081
Wait, what's going on?

48:49.209 --> 48:50.459
Can I have a second?

48:50.494 --> 48:51.710
I'll be out, I promise.

48:51.745 --> 48:52.508
Sure.

48:52.543 --> 48:53.969
You got two minutes,
and we'll be over there.

48:54.004 --> 48:54.802
Got it.

48:57.192 --> 48:58.424
Okay, what the fuck?

48:58.459 --> 48:59.222
It's okay.

48:59.257 --> 49:00.728
They just wanna ask me some questions.

49:00.763 --> 49:03.453
And this way, I can tell the
truth without Sharon around.

49:03.488 --> 49:05.018
Okay, but seriously,

49:05.053 --> 49:07.432
don't tell them anything that's
gonna get you in trouble.

49:07.467 --> 49:08.808
You know how they are.

49:08.843 --> 49:11.348
We all understand about
spells, and mind control,

49:11.383 --> 49:14.902
and magic whatevers, but
cops are like, "Yeah, right."

49:14.937 --> 49:16.077
I know, I know.

49:16.112 --> 49:18.693
I just don't think you
can use magic as an alibi.

49:18.728 --> 49:19.748
I gotta go.

49:19.783 --> 49:21.013
I'll see you at home?

49:21.048 --> 49:21.846
Later.

49:28.636 --> 49:30.907
What a nightmare.

49:30.942 --> 49:31.824
I'll say.

49:33.268 --> 49:34.492
I'm so exhausted.

49:34.527 --> 49:36.657
Can you just cancel my classes?

49:36.692 --> 49:38.601
I can't teach today.

49:38.636 --> 49:40.487
And then you can get the day off too.

49:40.522 --> 49:41.285
Really?

49:41.320 --> 49:42.287
Yeah, of course.

49:42.322 --> 49:43.120
Sweet.

50:17.589 --> 50:18.830
Why don't you
go make those phone calls

50:18.865 --> 50:19.858
you needed to make?

50:19.893 --> 50:20.965
What call?

50:21.000 --> 50:21.935
Yeah, right.

50:21.970 --> 50:22.870
Good call.

50:47.261 --> 50:49.344
It's just us girls now.

50:51.319 --> 50:54.468
Look, I know you've been through a lot,

50:54.503 --> 50:57.674
and I don't blame you if
you don't wanna talk to me,

50:57.709 --> 51:00.932
or if you think you owe Sharon something.

51:00.967 --> 51:03.765
But trust me, trust me, you don't.

51:10.283 --> 51:14.450
What happened to you, what
Samuel did to you is terrible.

51:19.155 --> 51:23.155
But I think Sharon's
heading down the same path.

51:24.137 --> 51:27.304
And if she is, we need you to tell us.

51:35.300 --> 51:37.217
Look, I know it's hard.

51:38.311 --> 51:39.144
I do.

51:40.751 --> 51:45.228
But for your own safety,
if you know anything about

51:45.263 --> 51:49.706
what happened to those two
people, you have to tell me.

52:08.016 --> 52:09.801
I'll tell you.

52:09.836 --> 52:12.734
Samuel wasn't killed that night.

52:12.769 --> 52:15.734
But we saw you destroy him.

52:19.817 --> 52:21.150
I can take it.

52:25.137 --> 52:25.970
Do it!

52:35.344 --> 52:36.344
Do it, Rose!

52:41.357 --> 52:43.937
Well, when I say he wasn't killed,

52:43.972 --> 52:46.415
I mean his soul wasn't killed.

52:46.450 --> 52:48.823
He's cursed to remain on our plane

52:48.858 --> 52:51.942
until he can summon his
godly form from hell

52:51.977 --> 52:55.766
and reunite it with his
physical being here on earth.

52:55.801 --> 52:59.555
I can't believe I'm following
along with this, but go on.

52:59.590 --> 53:02.788
That man in the motel was Samuel's son,

53:02.823 --> 53:05.986
and he was trying to bring him back.

53:06.927 --> 53:08.277
Who told you this?

53:08.312 --> 53:09.431
Sharon.

53:09.466 --> 53:12.744
But she had nothing to
do with this, I swear.

53:12.779 --> 53:14.897
I'd tell you if she did.

53:14.932 --> 53:15.991
And the girl?

53:16.026 --> 53:17.892
She was working with him.

53:17.927 --> 53:20.287
I'm not sure how she was
connected to the coven,

53:20.322 --> 53:22.849
but they ordered her killed too.

53:22.884 --> 53:25.325
Then why did she write your name

53:25.360 --> 53:27.732
in her blood on the concrete.

53:27.767 --> 53:30.652
And please don't tell
me it was a coincidence.

53:30.687 --> 53:34.854
Because they wanted me to
do it like I killed Samuel.

53:36.007 --> 53:38.002
She must have found out they'd asked me

53:38.037 --> 53:41.704
and assumed it was me
when she was attacked.

53:43.538 --> 53:45.757
You keep saying the coven.

53:45.792 --> 53:47.977
Who are you talking about?

53:48.012 --> 53:49.164
I need a name.

53:49.199 --> 53:50.328
I don't know.

53:50.363 --> 53:51.423
Bullshit.

53:51.458 --> 53:53.661
I don't, I swear.

53:53.696 --> 53:56.327
Rose, if you are trying
to protect someone...

53:56.362 --> 53:57.901
I'm not!

53:57.936 --> 53:59.733
Why would I protect them?

53:59.768 --> 54:01.531
They almost killed me.

54:05.346 --> 54:06.346
All right.

54:07.207 --> 54:08.872
I'm gonna let you go.

54:08.907 --> 54:10.503
Do not leave town.

54:10.538 --> 54:13.102
And do not get wrapped up in this.

54:13.137 --> 54:16.146
I'm not 100% convinced
that you're not involved.

54:16.181 --> 54:19.146
But if you aren't, keep it that way.

54:20.437 --> 54:21.437
I promise.

54:23.506 --> 54:25.256
Now get outta here.

54:38.188 --> 54:39.855
I know you're there.

54:41.978 --> 54:45.429
Either you're getting better
at this or I'm getting worse.

54:45.464 --> 54:47.467
Seriously, how do you do that?

54:47.502 --> 54:48.882
Do you float in here?

54:48.917 --> 54:52.077
Do you walk through the wall?

54:52.112 --> 54:53.509
You're the detective.

54:53.544 --> 54:54.342
Detect!

54:55.378 --> 54:58.219
Worse than a warlock
with a sense of humor,

54:58.254 --> 55:01.060
a warlock with a cryptic sense of humor.

55:03.148 --> 55:05.731
So what do you think about her?

55:07.429 --> 55:09.722
She's definitely involved.

55:09.757 --> 55:12.988
I can sense it on her, but
I don't think she's guilty.

55:13.023 --> 55:13.821
How so?

55:15.677 --> 55:17.452
I don't know exactly,

55:17.487 --> 55:20.897
just a sense that she
committed a crime yet didn't.

55:20.932 --> 55:24.307
I stopped by her house and
read her friend, Danielle.

55:24.342 --> 55:25.578
Did you get anything?

55:25.613 --> 55:26.913
Nada.

55:26.948 --> 55:28.273
Scanning that girl's brain

55:28.308 --> 55:31.563
is like searching through
an empty trashcan.

55:31.598 --> 55:34.818
But that yoga studio
is definitely involved.

55:34.853 --> 55:37.503
Again, yeah, in hindsight,

55:37.538 --> 55:39.114
we probably should have shut down

55:39.149 --> 55:42.638
the witchcraft yoga studio
when we had the chance.

55:42.673 --> 55:46.127
I did find out one piece
of useful information.

55:46.162 --> 55:46.960
A tattoo.

55:47.898 --> 55:48.994
Lovely.

55:49.029 --> 55:52.682
It represents some sort
of doorway or conduit.

55:52.717 --> 55:56.677
I'm beginning to think the
murder was a sign, not a warning.

55:56.712 --> 55:58.115
A sign of what?

55:58.150 --> 55:59.518
Nothing good.

56:09.435 --> 56:10.352
Trust me.

56:11.334 --> 56:13.800
This was all for your benefit.

56:13.835 --> 56:17.344
Although I will say this body is a treat.

56:17.379 --> 56:19.694
That yoga sure is paying off.

56:19.729 --> 56:21.643
Nice breasts by the way.

56:21.678 --> 56:23.208
And they're real!

56:23.243 --> 56:25.915
Sadly, you're never gonna
make it anywhere in Hollywood

56:25.950 --> 56:29.748
with real breasts, even
ones as nice as these.

56:31.274 --> 56:34.562
Sweetie, I'm just having some fun.

56:34.597 --> 56:37.851
It doesn't all have to be horrible.

56:38.864 --> 56:40.544
What the fuck are you doing?

56:57.144 --> 56:58.848
I swear to god.

56:58.883 --> 57:01.050
No, you swear to Aradia.

57:02.220 --> 57:03.465
What did you tell them?

57:03.500 --> 57:05.529
I'm going back down to the
police station right now

57:05.564 --> 57:08.346
and I'm gonna tell them the truth.

57:08.381 --> 57:10.059
No, you're not.

57:10.094 --> 57:11.301
Sharon!

57:11.336 --> 57:12.473
Rose!

57:12.508 --> 57:15.837
Listen to me, listen to your intellect.

57:15.872 --> 57:19.166
I did what I needed to to protect you.

57:20.209 --> 57:23.310
And you may not like it, but
you're a part of this coven.

57:23.345 --> 57:26.569
And that means when the
coven makes a decision,

57:26.604 --> 57:29.089
we all have to live by it.

57:29.124 --> 57:30.402
That's not fair.

57:30.437 --> 57:31.646
Define fair.

57:31.681 --> 57:36.189
Is it fair that witches have
been hunted for centuries?

57:36.224 --> 57:40.698
Is it fair that our kind has
been stalked and murdered?

57:40.733 --> 57:44.281
Is it fair that we have
to hide our powers?

57:45.448 --> 57:49.811
We are born in a world that
we're forced to live in,

57:49.846 --> 57:54.175
and goddammit, we do what
we need to to survive.

57:54.210 --> 57:56.342
That's just double talk!

57:57.198 --> 58:01.129
I told the detectives enough
to keep them off your trail.

58:01.164 --> 58:03.296
You should be thanking me.

58:04.535 --> 58:05.702
I'm leaving.

58:08.958 --> 58:11.291
Be mad at me all you want.

58:12.228 --> 58:15.509
You're not going to the detectives.

58:15.544 --> 58:18.791
And if you do, you will regret it.

58:23.653 --> 58:24.693
So nobody's here?

58:24.728 --> 58:25.698
No, totes alone.

58:25.733 --> 58:26.715
Are they gonna come back soon?

58:26.750 --> 58:27.800
No, gone for the day.

58:27.835 --> 58:28.816
Well, what about...

58:28.851 --> 58:30.605
Dude, are we doing this or what?

58:30.640 --> 58:32.272
Yes, totally, yes.

58:39.363 --> 58:41.533
Are you fucking kidding me?

58:41.568 --> 58:42.973
My cock is rock hard.

58:43.008 --> 58:43.806
Don't answer it.

58:43.841 --> 58:45.032
I have to.

58:45.067 --> 58:46.189
Hello?

58:46.224 --> 58:47.738
No, I'm good.

58:47.773 --> 58:50.413
Wait, did you just call me your favorite?

58:50.448 --> 58:52.913
Of course I won't tell anyone.

58:56.683 --> 58:58.357
I'm so flattered.

58:58.392 --> 59:00.031
Yes, of course.

59:01.621 --> 59:02.552
I'm on it.

59:02.587 --> 59:03.484
Later.

59:04.792 --> 59:05.973
Okay, we gotta go.

59:06.008 --> 59:06.771
What?

59:06.806 --> 59:08.941
Okay, a second ago, I just told you

59:08.976 --> 59:10.892
how hard my cock is, so...

59:10.927 --> 59:12.842
I love that story.

59:12.877 --> 59:13.640
Get dressed.

59:13.675 --> 59:15.425
We've got work to do.

59:31.089 --> 59:32.742
Hey, is Tara here?

59:32.777 --> 59:34.697
No, haven't seen her all day.

59:34.732 --> 59:36.617
She isn't answering her phone.

59:36.652 --> 59:38.479
I need to text her.

59:38.514 --> 59:39.812
See you later.

59:44.057 --> 59:45.078
Come on, Tara.

59:45.113 --> 59:46.100
Text me back.

59:47.079 --> 59:47.973
I'm so dumb.

59:48.008 --> 59:49.078
I forgot something.

59:49.113 --> 59:50.148
What did you forget?

59:50.183 --> 59:50.981
You.

59:52.568 --> 59:53.719
Totally do my bidding.

59:53.754 --> 59:54.552
Carry her.

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:05.875
Well, I have one stop to make.

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:07.070
Well, two.

01:00:07.105 --> 01:00:09.188
I think I want a slushie.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.290
I have something.

01:00:15.325 --> 01:00:16.506
Jesus!

01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:18.361
Is it impossible for you to enter the room

01:00:18.396 --> 01:00:20.287
like a normal person?

01:00:20.322 --> 01:00:24.122
The tattoo on Jamal, it's a conduit.

01:00:24.157 --> 01:00:25.127
A conduit?

01:00:25.162 --> 01:00:27.362
There are witches and
warlocks that act as a doorway

01:00:27.397 --> 01:00:31.527
between our plane or any
other demonic planes.

01:00:31.562 --> 01:00:32.325
But he's dead.

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.391
Doesn't that mean closed for business?

01:00:34.426 --> 01:00:36.426
No, they have to be dead.

01:00:36.461 --> 01:00:39.208
Spirits use their bodies to crossover.

01:00:39.243 --> 01:00:40.541
That's creepy.

01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:43.721
The murder wasn't a warning.

01:00:43.756 --> 01:00:45.471
It was an invitation.

01:00:51.803 --> 01:00:53.592
This is so exciting!

01:00:53.627 --> 01:00:54.675
Yes, it is.

01:00:55.613 --> 01:00:59.280
But Danielle, just tone
it down a bit, okay?

01:01:01.494 --> 01:01:03.288
Absolutely.

01:01:03.323 --> 01:01:07.490
I think it's about time to
wake Ms. Rose up, please.

01:01:09.886 --> 01:01:12.386
Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

01:01:14.285 --> 01:01:15.515
What's going on?

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:17.160
Calm down.

01:01:17.195 --> 01:01:18.825
No, why am I tied to this chair?

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:19.930
Let me go!

01:01:19.965 --> 01:01:22.298
I said calm the fuck down.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.732
And don't try to use a magic spell

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:30.024
to get out of these restraints.

01:01:30.059 --> 01:01:31.904
I double binded them.

01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:32.967
I helped!

01:01:33.002 --> 01:01:34.669
Yes, yes, you did.

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:40.544
Our great work is about to begin.

01:01:41.962 --> 01:01:45.104
Samuel was right to choose you.

01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:46.687
You're so powerful.

01:01:48.133 --> 01:01:49.633
Aradia be praised.

01:01:51.002 --> 01:01:53.853
Samuel will be so happy to use you

01:01:53.888 --> 01:01:56.020
to come back to the coven.

01:01:58.984 --> 01:02:01.512
There's going to be an awakening.

01:02:01.547 --> 01:02:04.040
Danielle, what are you doing here?

01:02:04.075 --> 01:02:06.104
What did she tell you?

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:08.098
Why are you helping her?

01:02:08.133 --> 01:02:10.754
Because there's great
work to be done here,

01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:12.682
and because I'm loyal to the coven,

01:02:12.717 --> 01:02:14.274
and because I'm her favorite.

01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:15.648
She told me so.

01:02:15.683 --> 01:02:17.533
Danielle...

01:02:17.568 --> 01:02:19.090
Don't be jelly.

01:02:19.125 --> 01:02:20.578
Where's Tara?

01:02:20.613 --> 01:02:23.653
I know she wouldn't betray me like this.

01:02:23.688 --> 01:02:26.882
I'm taking very good care of her.

01:02:26.917 --> 01:02:27.882
Don't worry.

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.915
Hey, Rose, I'm home.

01:02:36.693 --> 01:02:37.526
Rose?

01:02:39.613 --> 01:02:40.446
Rose?

01:02:42.173 --> 01:02:43.256
Are you here?

01:02:45.922 --> 01:02:47.458
Sorry I didn't text you back.

01:02:47.493 --> 01:02:49.874
My phone died, and I had to charge it.

01:02:49.909 --> 01:02:51.039
Great.

01:02:51.074 --> 01:02:52.673
I could feel it.

01:02:52.708 --> 01:02:53.607
What?

01:02:53.642 --> 01:02:55.480
Samuel, he's in there.

01:02:55.515 --> 01:02:57.562
Or he's gonna be.

01:02:57.597 --> 01:02:58.759
No!

01:02:58.794 --> 01:03:00.566
I'll go in there alone.

01:03:00.601 --> 01:03:03.934
This is definitely above your pay grade.

01:03:10.082 --> 01:03:14.762
Danielle, sweetheart,
it's time for you to leave.

01:03:14.797 --> 01:03:15.599
What?

01:03:15.634 --> 01:03:17.344
What about the awakening?

01:03:17.379 --> 01:03:19.511
I need you far away.

01:03:21.442 --> 01:03:24.704
What if something were to happen to me?

01:03:24.739 --> 01:03:27.218
What if I were to get killed?

01:03:27.253 --> 01:03:30.704
Who would run the witchcraft yoga studio?

01:03:30.739 --> 01:03:32.348
You want me to run the studio?

01:03:32.383 --> 01:03:34.483
No, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

01:03:34.518 --> 01:03:37.150
Just go and wait for word, okay?

01:03:39.748 --> 01:03:41.006
Okay, no problem.

01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:41.883
Bye, Rose.

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:45.001
I'll totally take care of your house.

01:03:47.595 --> 01:03:48.928
Alone at last.

01:03:52.697 --> 01:03:55.225
Sharon, you can't do this.

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.101
Think about it.

01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:58.502
Samuel was a demon, not a warlock.

01:03:58.537 --> 01:04:00.742
His magic is dark and evil.

01:04:00.777 --> 01:04:02.816
All he wanted was to rule over humanity

01:04:02.851 --> 01:04:05.059
and create hell on earth!

01:04:05.094 --> 01:04:07.267
Well, as far as plans go,

01:04:09.403 --> 01:04:11.033
that one's not half bad.

01:04:11.068 --> 01:04:12.865
But I destroyed him.

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:14.663
No, silly young witch.

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:19.310
You can't just destroy a demon.

01:04:19.345 --> 01:04:22.345
His life is in every child he sired.

01:04:24.233 --> 01:04:26.566
And that man, he got around.

01:04:45.946 --> 01:04:48.212
I wasn't lying before when I said Jamal

01:04:48.247 --> 01:04:52.414
was also one of Samuel's children,
but that's what makes him

01:04:53.786 --> 01:04:57.119
the perfect conduit for Samuel's return.

01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:00.562
You're crazy if you think
I'm gonna help you do this.

01:05:00.597 --> 01:05:03.876
I need your flesh.

01:05:03.911 --> 01:05:06.328
I'm going to feed you to him.

01:05:28.036 --> 01:05:28.869
Rise!

01:05:29.778 --> 01:05:30.611
Rise!

01:05:34.979 --> 01:05:37.841
I feel like we should be in there.

01:05:37.876 --> 01:05:39.864
I wouldn't if I were you.

01:05:39.899 --> 01:05:42.970
Well, we have to stop the
yoga witchcraft murder spree.

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:44.130
Well, good luck with that.

01:05:44.165 --> 01:05:44.963
Bye.

01:05:50.636 --> 01:05:51.469
I

01:05:52.905 --> 01:05:53.738
Am

01:05:55.355 --> 01:05:56.188
Free.

01:05:58.185 --> 01:05:59.685
Samuel.

01:06:07.534 --> 01:06:08.451
This body

01:06:10.714 --> 01:06:11.547
is broken.

01:06:14.276 --> 01:06:15.859
What have you done?

01:06:18.915 --> 01:06:22.348
Why have you trapped me in
this wretched piece of garbage?

01:06:22.383 --> 01:06:23.541
This body,

01:06:23.576 --> 01:06:24.700
it will heal.

01:06:26.013 --> 01:06:28.430
I have brought you the power.

01:06:29.423 --> 01:06:30.621
Look.

01:06:30.656 --> 01:06:31.820
My child.

01:06:36.124 --> 01:06:37.569
Yes.

01:06:37.604 --> 01:06:38.604
Feed on her.

01:06:40.244 --> 01:06:41.994
Feed on your progeny.

01:06:44.572 --> 01:06:47.336
Take the marrow from her bone.

01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:50.101
Suck the power from her soul.

01:06:52.572 --> 01:06:54.155
You've done well.

01:06:57.124 --> 01:06:59.707
And your reward shall be death.

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:02.383
Rose, it's me!

01:07:09.841 --> 01:07:10.674
And now,

01:07:14.081 --> 01:07:15.414
the main course.

01:07:17.631 --> 01:07:19.827
Get away from me!

01:07:19.862 --> 01:07:23.012
But don't you wanna
be daddy's little girl?

01:07:23.047 --> 01:07:25.036
We're so much alike.

01:07:25.071 --> 01:07:28.404
You've inherited some of my best traits.

01:07:29.543 --> 01:07:32.262
I'll never be like you.

01:07:32.297 --> 01:07:33.095
Like me?

01:07:34.671 --> 01:07:36.004
You'll be in me.

01:07:38.589 --> 01:07:41.621
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

01:07:41.656 --> 01:07:42.454
Spanner.

01:07:43.551 --> 01:07:44.801
Welcome back.

01:07:46.223 --> 01:07:48.777
Time and again, you have meddled

01:07:48.812 --> 01:07:53.202
in the coven's business
for much too long, traitor.

01:07:53.237 --> 01:07:56.268
Time and again have you
betrayed your own kind

01:07:56.303 --> 01:07:59.812
only to carry favor with
the powerless and mundane.

01:07:59.847 --> 01:08:01.395
And this stops now!

01:08:07.676 --> 01:08:09.593
Rose, use your power!

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.673
With me!

01:08:20.531 --> 01:08:23.424
My offspring, what is human in you

01:08:23.459 --> 01:08:27.372
that prevents the full use
of you hell-given talent.

01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:31.538
I'll consume your human flesh

01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:35.197
and consume your power and feed.

01:08:36.859 --> 01:08:40.167
Our powers shall become one.

01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:43.442
We're not strong enough.

01:08:43.477 --> 01:08:45.868
I need to channel through you.

01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:47.277
You'll kill me.

01:08:47.312 --> 01:08:48.593
No!

01:08:48.627 --> 01:08:50.417
Just guide the power through you.

01:08:50.453 --> 01:08:52.751
Concentrate, open your palm.

01:08:55.237 --> 01:08:56.237
Concentrate!

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:14.837
Freeze.

01:09:14.872 --> 01:09:16.622
Everybody's hands up.

01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:41.237
I'm gonna hate to do
the paperwork on this.

01:09:41.272 --> 01:09:42.569
What the fuck?

01:09:49.639 --> 01:09:52.460
Once again, Rose saves the day.

01:09:52.495 --> 01:09:54.595
She's very powerful.

01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:57.710
This isn't the last time
bad elements from the coven

01:09:57.745 --> 01:10:00.790
are gonna try to take
advantage of her or kill her.

01:10:00.825 --> 01:10:03.161
Would protective custody do any good?

01:10:03.196 --> 01:10:04.734
You tell me.

01:10:04.769 --> 01:10:06.352
No, probably not.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.515
She's gonna have to learn
how to defend herself.

01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:12.129
Now that we've worked together,
who knows what type of hell

01:10:12.164 --> 01:10:15.007
Samuel would have
unleashed against humanity.

01:10:15.042 --> 01:10:17.334
She's powerful, but she's also smart.

01:10:17.369 --> 01:10:19.674
She won't let something
like that happen again.

01:10:19.709 --> 01:10:21.980
And if she does, I'd
personally kick her ass.

01:10:22.015 --> 01:10:23.694
I'd like to see that.

01:10:23.729 --> 01:10:25.334
I should get going back inside.

01:10:25.369 --> 01:10:26.894
Call us if you need anything.

01:10:26.929 --> 01:10:28.420
Just don't need anything.

01:10:28.455 --> 01:10:29.253
Got it.

01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:33.300
Let's go get a beef dip
sandwich at Pinelli's.

01:10:33.335 --> 01:10:35.005
You coming, Spanner?

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.360
Hey, sunshine, are you hungry?

01:10:37.395 --> 01:10:40.002
You wanna get something to eat?

01:10:40.037 --> 01:10:42.609
Something's not quite right.

01:10:42.644 --> 01:10:43.407
You think?

01:10:43.442 --> 01:10:45.249
We just stopped the demon
from taking over the world.

01:10:45.284 --> 01:10:46.446
I'm sure there's some residue left

01:10:46.481 --> 01:10:49.129
from that magical bullshit
still floating in the air.

01:10:49.164 --> 01:10:51.542
But until that magical
bullshit commits a crime,

01:10:51.577 --> 01:10:53.920
I don't think we have
anything to worry about.

01:10:53.955 --> 01:10:54.920
So let's go.

01:11:02.872 --> 01:11:04.695
Are you all right?

01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:06.289
No.

01:11:06.324 --> 01:11:09.157
Here, let me help you up.

01:11:12.507 --> 01:11:14.101
Tara, what are you doing?

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:15.997
You said you'll always have my back.

01:11:16.032 --> 01:11:17.580
Yeah, about that.

01:11:19.517 --> 01:11:21.837
So sadly, the days of your best friend

01:11:21.872 --> 01:11:24.587
having your back are over.

01:11:24.622 --> 01:11:25.420
Tara.

01:11:26.808 --> 01:11:28.641
Now, now, don't cry.

01:11:29.695 --> 01:11:31.487
I'll be your new best friend.

01:11:31.522 --> 01:11:32.371
I swear.

01:11:32.406 --> 01:11:35.437
I won't even hold it against
you that you tried to kill me.

01:11:35.472 --> 01:11:36.270
Shut up!

01:11:37.237 --> 01:11:39.772
Is that any way to talk to your friends?

01:11:39.807 --> 01:11:42.307
I think it's time for some bestie bonding.

01:11:42.342 --> 01:11:45.167
Best girlfriends share everything.

01:11:45.202 --> 01:11:47.993
So let's start with your powers.

01:11:50.178 --> 01:11:52.108
Let me in, you little bitch!

01:11:52.143 --> 01:11:54.025
Not a fucking chance!

01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:56.863
Wait!

01:12:14.298 --> 01:12:16.298
There's always people in here.

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:17.131
Let's go.

01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:25.115
Why didn't we get a
motel room before?

01:13:25.150 --> 01:13:27.232
This is fucking great.

01:13:27.267 --> 01:13:29.280
Danielle was a lucky girl.

01:13:29.315 --> 01:13:32.875
If I had you, I'd never
let you leave the bedroom.

01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:34.544
What are you talking about?

01:13:34.579 --> 01:13:35.813
You are Danielle.

01:13:35.848 --> 01:13:37.416
Sorry, stud.

01:13:37.451 --> 01:13:38.949
I'm Sharon.

01:13:38.984 --> 01:13:43.151
You're a great fuck, Nick,
but I don't like loose ends.
