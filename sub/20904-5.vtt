<b>The only thing is,</b>

12:31.818 --> 12:33.887
<b> <i>as opposed to something</i> </b>

12:33.954 --> 12:35.989

12:36.089 --> 12:37.300
<b>- Yeah, we see what</b>

12:37.324 --> 12:38.725

<b> <i>really, really look nice.</i> </b>

<b>But you also got to remember,</b>
<b>today is composition.</b>

12:45.699 --> 12:48.001
<b>Is it the most dynamic</b>
<b>composition in the room?</b>

12:50.571 --> 12:52.239
<b>- Next team up is</b>
<b>House of Monkey.</b>

12:52.306 --> 12:53.449
<b>- Well, guys, I like the design,</b>

12:53.473 --> 12:54.908
<b> <i>but I think that</i> </b>
<b> <i>compositionally,</i> </b>

12:54.975 --> 12:56.710
<b> <i>you could've had</i> </b>
<b> <i>an interesting ending.</i> </b>

12:56.777 --> 12:58.779
<b>- It just looks unfinished.</b>

12:58.846 --> 13:00.046
<b>- Old Town Ink.</b>

13:00.047 --> 13:01.615
<b>- It's a very clean tattoo.</b>

13:01.682 --> 13:03.650
<b> <i>The outline and color</i> </b>
<b> <i>saturation in this thing</i> </b>

13:03.717 --> 13:05.051
<b> <i>are pretty spotless.</i> </b>

13:05.052 --> 13:07.788
<b>But it's not a really</b>

13:08.956 --> 13:10.224
<b>- Allegory Arts.</b>

13:10.290 --> 13:12.659
<b> <i>I like the flow</i> </b>

13:12.726 --> 13:15.095
<b> <i>That bright, solid patch</i> </b>
<b> <i>of red behind it</i> </b>

13:15.162 --> 13:17.898
<b> <i>does play necessary for the</i> </b>
<b> <i>composition to pull together.</i> </b>

13:17.965 --> 13:21.401
<b>It's very simple</b>
<b>and very deliberate.</b>

13:21.468 --> 13:23.136
<b>- Think Before You Ink.</b>

13:23.203 --> 13:25.906
<b> <i>These black halos, it doesn't</i> </b>
<b> <i>do anything compositionally</i> </b>

13:25.973 --> 13:27.107
<b> <i>for your tattoo.</i> </b>

13:27.174 --> 13:29.076
<b>It makes it just</b>
<b>a very hard ending.</b>

13:29.109 --> 13:30.410
<b>- It's a little bit stale.</b>

13:30.477 --> 13:32.155

<b>- What is it exactly that you</b>

21:07.452 --> 21:10.088

<b>But we need to add an element</b>
<b>that he's getting the [bleep]</b>

21:12.757 --> 21:14.058
<b>kicked out of him.</b> <b>- Right.</b>

21:14.125 --> 21:16.293

21:16.294 --> 21:18.430

<b>- It's beautiful.</b>
<b>- Cool, yay. Awesome.</b>

22:44.263 --> 22:45.932

<b> <i>there's a foreground,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and you have a background.</i> </b>

22:51.704 --> 22:54.807
<b>And that all takes composition</b>
<b>to execute.</b>

22:54.874 --> 22:57.109

24:38.311 --> 24:40.746
<b>- Um, it's pretty soft as it is.</b>

24:40.780 --> 24:42.548

<b>a little more</b>

24:42.615 --> 24:43.950
<b>even with the bottom.</b>

24:44.016 --> 24:45.818

24:45.885 --> 24:48.087

24:48.154 --> 24:50.957

<b>I'm not picturing it</b>

24:53.025 --> 24:56.062
<b>and I'm worried that it's</b>

24:56.128 --> 24:58.264
<b>- Yeah, but as artists, we like</b>

24:58.331 --> 25:00.075

<b>a collaboration together,</b>

25:00.099 --> 25:01.033

25:01.100 --> 25:02.702
<b>- But it's my tattoo, so...</b>

25:02.768 --> 25:04.437
<b>give me... give me a minute.</b>

25:04.504 --> 25:06.139
<b>- Okay.</b>

25:08.741 --> 25:10.510
<b>Now I'm in fricking panic mode.</b>

25:13.846 --> 25:15.224

<b>and she's second-guessing</b>
<b>everything we're doing.</b>

25:18.084 --> 25:19.719

25:21.521 --> 25:23.723
<b>- So when you do the cuffs,</b>
<b>these cuffs are leather.</b>

25:23.789 --> 25:25.601
<b>Not the skin, but it's the same</b>
<b>brown tone right now.</b>

25:25.625 --> 25:27.527
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b> <i>- Our goal to make this tattoo</i> </b>

25:29.028 --> 25:30.263

<b> <i>My only nervous thought is,</i> </b>

<b>As the jury of peers,</b>

33:41.146 --> 33:42.247

<b>- Except D.J. and Bubba,</b>

33:48.286 --> 33:50.822
<b>- I didn't get to give</b>
<b>the client a finished piece.</b>

33:50.889 --> 33:53.424
<b>But an unfinished tattoo</b>
<b>can be worked on later.</b>

33:53.425 --> 33:55.293
<b>A busted-ass tattoo is [bleep].</b>

33:55.427 --> 33:58.330

<b>Your tattoo was garbage.</b>

33:58.430 --> 34:01.132

<b>in one session.</b>

34:02.801 --> 34:04.111
<b>- Yeah, that's called</b>

34:04.135 --> 34:05.713
<b>- In one session.</b>
<b>You've done that in one session?</b>

<b>- Maybe we didn't [inaudible],</b>
<b>maybe we should've gone smaller,</b>

34:30.733 --> 34:31.833

34:41.677 --> 34:43.212
<b>- Pins and Needles.</b>

34:43.279 --> 34:44.989
<b>- It might not be the best</b>
<b>quality and have all the colors</b>

34:45.014 --> 34:46.791
<b> <i>in there, but this'll pass</i> </b>
<b> <i>as a finished tattoo.</i> </b>

34:46.815 --> 34:48.159

34:48.183 --> 34:49.618
<b>that there's no</b>
<b>battle scene here?</b>

34:49.685 --> 34:53.054

34:53.121 --> 34:54.556

34:54.623 --> 34:56.725

34:56.792 --> 34:58.203
<b>- So everybody's off the board</b>
<b>for that one.</b>

34:58.227 --> 34:59.771
<b>- Think Before You Ink said</b>
<b>theirs was finished,</b>

34:59.795 --> 35:01.730
<b>and I feel like</b>
<b>that's a bigger problem,</b>

35:01.797 --> 35:02.898
<b> <i>thinking that's finished.</i> </b>

35:02.965 --> 35:06.201
<b>- Why do the lines</b>

35:06.268 --> 35:08.737

35:08.804 --> 35:10.839
<b>Black Spade.</b>
<b>This is all throughout.</b>

35:10.906 --> 35:12.146

35:12.207 --> 35:13.976

35:14.043 --> 35:16.512
<b> <i>These look like two</i> </b>

35:17.947 --> 35:19.658
<b>Looks like some mother[bleep]</b>
<b>are gonna die.</b>

35:19.682 --> 35:21.684
<b>- Your sail lines are [bleep],</b>
<b>all of them shaking.</b>

35:21.750 --> 35:23.819
<b>- For me, when it comes</b>
<b>to a design,</b>

35:23.886 --> 35:27.256
<b>your guys's drawing, from</b>
<b>the get-go, was just wrong.</b>

35:27.323 --> 35:29.658
<b>And it's actually my</b>
<b>biggest pet peeve,</b>

35:29.725 --> 35:31.794

35:33.262 --> 35:35.097
<b>- Testing composition today,</b>

<b>and we got a multitude</b>
<b>of tattoos to choose</b>

35:37.733 --> 35:39.268
<b>for bottom of the day.</b>

35:39.335 --> 35:40.603
<b>- Let's pick a few.</b>

35:40.669 --> 35:42.238
<b>- Pins and Needles</b>
<b>didn't do [bleep].</b>

35:42.304 --> 35:44.640
<b> <i>Their sad little guy walking</i> </b>
<b> <i>away that's, like,</i> </b>

<b> <i>an emo warrior,</i> </b>
<b> <i>that's just all poorly done.</i> </b>

35:47.109 --> 35:49.345
<b>- But it's not as ugly as some</b>
<b>of the other ones.</b>

35:49.478 --> 35:51.480
<b>- Oliver, her client said,</b>
<b>"You're jacking me up,</b>

35:51.547 --> 35:52.915
<b>[bleep] you guys."</b>

35:52.982 --> 35:55.651

35:55.718 --> 35:58.520
<b> <i>The drawing, the composition,</i> </b>
<b> <i>the techniques...</i> </b>

35:58.587 --> 36:00.322
<b>- But I would argue</b>
<b>that it is not as bad</b>

36:00.389 --> 36:01.323
<b>as Think Before You Ink.</b>

36:01.390 --> 36:03.058
<b> <i>- I don't know.</i> </b>

36:06.328 --> 36:07.572
