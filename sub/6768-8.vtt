WEBVTT

00:07.632 --> 00:08.675
{\an1}All clear?

00:08.758 --> 00:12.721
Mom and Zach are present
and snoring in the bedroom.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.556
{\an3}Hmm, snoring?
Oh, yeah.

00:14.639 --> 00:15.849
They're having
some sort of contest

00:15.932 --> 00:17.600
to see who can
snore the loudest.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.310
Zach's a real natural.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.562
Really?
Yeah.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.105
Is it all right if I
hang out for a while?

00:22.188 --> 00:23.732
Mm, I don't know.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.483
How quiet can you be?

00:25.567 --> 00:27.610
{\an3}Well, you know me,
I'm a stealth lover.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.155
{\an3}I can sneak up on you when
you least expect it and bam!

00:30.238 --> 00:31.781
{\an1}You talk too much.
Do I?

00:31.865 --> 00:35.493
Yeah, but you do have
some hidden qualities.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.954
You have no idea.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.623
Mommy?

00:40.707 --> 00:42.876
(Steve grunts)

00:42.959 --> 00:44.461
Yeah... sweetie?

00:44.544 --> 00:45.837
Grandma's snoring.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.173
Oh...

00:48.256 --> 00:51.676
{\an3}Well, you know, um,
if you just, uh,

00:51.760 --> 00:53.595
take her by the arm and
shake her, she'll stop.

00:53.678 --> 00:54.596
Okay.

00:54.679 --> 00:55.972
But I'm thirsty.

00:56.055 --> 00:58.057
Okay, oh, you want me to get
you a glass of water?

00:58.141 --> 00:59.642
Okay. Steve?

00:59.726 --> 01:01.519
You're taking me

01:01.603 --> 01:02.771
to the soccer game
tomorrow, right?

01:02.854 --> 01:04.522
You got it, big guy.

01:04.605 --> 01:07.650
{\an3}Okay, you go back in,
I'll be in in a second.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.700
(both snickering)

01:15.784 --> 01:17.243
I better go.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.662
You don't have to.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.830
I know, but it's best.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.373
Someone wants some water.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.958
Sorry.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.967
A little something
to remember me by.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.805
(purring, chuckling)

01:38.556 --> 01:40.016
{\an5}KELLY:
<i>Brandon, I think</i>
<i>we missed the turn</i>

01:40.099 --> 01:42.185
{\an5}for the freeway.
Eh, we're taking
the scenic route.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.648
Hey, while you're at it,
throw this in there.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.692
Hopefully, I'll never
have to wear it again.

01:49.776 --> 01:53.196
I thought you said the play
picked up by the third act.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.322
Yeah, it did.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.032
I slept through
the first two acts.

01:56.115 --> 01:58.326
(both chuckling)

02:03.623 --> 02:04.666
Hookers.

02:04.749 --> 02:05.792
{\an3}KELLY:
Look at her.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.418
She can't be more than 15.

02:07.502 --> 02:08.502
Yeah, it's sad, isn't it?

02:09.545 --> 02:11.714
Oh, great, I think she
caught me looking at her.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.633
What are you looking at, huh?

02:16.302 --> 02:17.554
Brandon, stop the car.

02:18.805 --> 02:19.514
What, what, what?

02:19.597 --> 02:20.265
Back up, back up.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.558
{\an1}I think I know
that girl.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.059
{\an4}The hooker?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Back up.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.144
I swear, she looks
like Dylan's sister.

02:26.813 --> 02:27.939
Erica?

02:28.022 --> 02:29.232
{\an3}BRANDON:
Oh, my God, Erica.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.067
What the hell...?

02:31.150 --> 02:33.027
Kelly, stay here,
keep the doors locked.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.321
Erica!

02:36.739 --> 02:38.032
Erica?

02:47.667 --> 02:49.252
Erica, is that you?

02:52.672 --> 02:53.590
What are you doing?

02:53.673 --> 02:55.842
Just leave me alone, okay?

02:56.801 --> 02:58.803
Erica, it's me, Kelly.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.719
Detective Pate at the LAPD

05:02.802 --> 05:04.595
didn't give us much hope
of finding her right away.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.681
Said she'd probably be
laying low for a while.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.933
Pate's right and wrong.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.977
She's gotta work,

05:11.060 --> 05:13.730
gotta eat, or at least
slam some coke or crack

05:13.813 --> 05:15.857
{\an3}or whatever the hell it is
that keeps her going.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.693
Do you know if she's hooking
for a pimp or on her own?

05:18.776 --> 05:20.862
This is Dylan's sister
we're talking about here.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.030
You didn't know her.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.698
She was the sweetest
little girl.

05:23.781 --> 05:24.699
They all were.

05:24.782 --> 05:26.451
Till somebody messed with them.

05:26.534 --> 05:29.454
I realize we both work
for the same foundation

05:29.537 --> 05:31.581
and I want to be able
to help you.

05:31.664 --> 05:32.749
But you've gotta
handle this differently

05:32.832 --> 05:34.417
than one of your day care cases.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.128
{\an3}We're not talking about
little girls here.

05:37.211 --> 05:40.590
These are young women with some
very serious adult problems.

05:40.673 --> 05:41.758
Listen, Pam, we, uh,

05:41.841 --> 05:43.092
talked to my sister in London;

05:43.176 --> 05:45.219
we got a little
more information.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.763
{\an3}Seems that
Erica was living

05:46.846 --> 05:48.431
with Dylan's mother in Hawaii.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.391
{\an1}She was dating a
surfer guy, a real stoner.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.810
She followed him out here,
he dumped her,

05:52.894 --> 05:54.562
that's where they
lost track of her.

05:54.645 --> 05:58.608
Yeah, here's, um,
a snapshot that they

05:58.691 --> 06:00.026
overnighted us.

06:02.153 --> 06:02.820
Pretty.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.113
Let's get a stack of

06:04.197 --> 06:05.782
blowups of this picture
and I'll take it out

06:05.865 --> 06:07.116
in the outreach van
with me this afternoon.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.659
I don't expect much,

06:08.743 --> 06:10.119
but it's a start.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.330
I'd like to go with you.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.498
(sighing):
Kelly...

06:13.581 --> 06:15.291
she's not
who you think she is.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.502
{\an3}Give up this
little girl stuff.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.254
She didn't exactly come running
into your arms last night.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.631
{\an6}BRANDON:
I think she was
scared, Pam,

06:21.714 --> 06:23.341
I don't even know
if she recognized us.

06:23.424 --> 06:24.634
Try "She was high as a kite."

06:24.717 --> 06:28.137
I don't mean to be harsh, but
I've gotta cut through it all.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.598
We'll find her.

06:30.681 --> 06:31.933
Look, it's hard.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.476
I know you want to be there

06:33.559 --> 06:34.602
because you think
you can save her.

06:34.685 --> 06:37.021
No, I think <i> you</i> can save her.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.606
I just want to help.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.030
VALERIE:
<i>Am I interrupting?</i>

06:46.114 --> 06:47.740
What the hell
are you doing here?

06:51.744 --> 06:54.163
{\an3}(sighing heavily):
Well...

06:54.247 --> 06:56.958
Since you haven't
returned my phone calls...

06:57.041 --> 06:59.335
We've got nothing
to talk about.

06:59.418 --> 07:03.005
Look, Noah, just...

07:03.089 --> 07:04.423
just hear me out.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.551
{\an1}Okay?

07:06.634 --> 07:08.678
I'm sorry.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.638
{\an1}Look, I made
a mistake.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.141
Cooper Hargrove
meant nothing to me.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.226
{\an1}Nothing.

07:15.309 --> 07:16.811
But you do.

07:16.894 --> 07:19.730
Sometimes you gotta
live with your mistakes.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.232
Just wait, okay?

07:24.944 --> 07:28.030
You can't pretend that...

07:28.114 --> 07:30.199
you don't want me
as much as I want you.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.536
{\an1}You can't
throw this away.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.872
Not what we have.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.713
No.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.464
{\an3}Look, whatever we
had is gone--

07:45.548 --> 07:46.841
dead and buried, okay?

07:46.924 --> 07:49.844
That's what you do
best, isn't it?

07:51.012 --> 07:52.847
Bury people.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.525
Hey, I can do that.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.694
Hey, Dan, I need to talk
to you about something.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.779
{\an3}Sure.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.492
{\an1}You've been doing a
great job around here.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.495
But you need to start
looking for a new one.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.248
{\an1}I told Kirk
the same thing last night.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.708
It's been slow.

08:20.791 --> 08:21.542
I'll ride it out.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.627
I can't pay you.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.795
I can't even pay you
for last week.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.632
{\an1}I owe you,
the landlord, Donna...

08:27.715 --> 08:31.594
I can't believe what's
happened to this place.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.429
David, don't get me wrong...

08:33.511 --> 08:34.554
but I know a guy.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.265
He could help you.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.851
Really? How?

08:38.934 --> 08:40.061
With a loan.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.104
I can't get a loan.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.731
Believe me, I've tried.

08:43.813 --> 08:45.066
It's not that kind of loan.

08:45.149 --> 08:48.236
He's sort of like
a private bank.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.737
{\an3}Short term.

08:49.820 --> 08:50.655
Very short term.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.407
{\an3}Is he a friend of yours?
Yeah.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.618
But only 'cause I managed
to pay him back on time.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.161
His rates are steep.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.663
But if you're desperate...

08:58.746 --> 09:00.957
Desperate doesn't
begin to explain it.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.709
Could you set something up?

09:03.793 --> 09:06.295
I'll give him a call.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.421
Hey, Donna!

09:07.505 --> 09:09.590
{\an1}Hey.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.092
Uh, do that and, um,

09:11.175 --> 09:12.635
if you could check
the taps, too?

09:12.718 --> 09:14.762
Sure.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.681
He's such a slave driver.

09:16.764 --> 09:17.807
Hey, you.
Hey.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.101
You look great.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.937
And I thought I was going to be
making you happy this morning.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.438
You do.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.692
Well, I'm not so sure
of that lately.

09:27.775 --> 09:31.696
But, um, listen, do you
remember Vanessa Markley?

09:31.779 --> 09:35.616
Yeah, she set up that, uh,

09:35.700 --> 09:37.618
whole ridiculous photo
shoot thing in Hawaii.

09:37.702 --> 09:40.997
Yeah, and she recommended me
for another styling job.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.498
Donna, that's great.

09:42.581 --> 09:43.499
Mm-hmm.

09:43.582 --> 09:44.667
Everything's all in place

09:44.750 --> 09:46.711
except you know, the location,

09:46.794 --> 09:49.964
it just happened to fall through
at the very last moment.

09:50.047 --> 09:54.010
So, I kinda recommended
this local, wonderful club.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.555
It's a good fee.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.682
{\an3}Are you saying you want
to use this place?

09:59.765 --> 10:01.809
Tomorrow. During the day, so it
won't mess with your business.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.519
Donna, what business?

10:03.602 --> 10:05.521
This is great.

10:05.604 --> 10:07.064
Thank you.
Oh, God, I owe you one.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.525
You're welcome.

10:09.608 --> 10:11.027
Can we celebrate
tomorrow night?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.403
Absolutely.

10:14.613 --> 10:15.823
MAN:
All right, looks good!

10:15.906 --> 10:20.369
(people laughing,
conversing indistinctly)

10:20.453 --> 10:23.205
{\an1}Zach, hey, Zach,
you didn't tell me

10:23.289 --> 10:24.540
{\an1}this was a
father-son deal.

10:24.623 --> 10:26.334
I forgot to say.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.878
You know how much
I care about you, right?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.671
But you know I'm not your dad.
I know.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.341
But you're sort of like...

10:33.424 --> 10:34.550
my pretend dad.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.719
Well, your mom and I...

10:36.802 --> 10:37.345
{\an1}JERRY FOGLE:
Zach!

10:37.428 --> 10:39.055
Hey, is that your old man?

10:39.138 --> 10:40.056
No, I... I...

10:40.139 --> 10:41.557
I see the resemblance.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.100
Jerry Fogle.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.894
{\an1}Great kid you got here--
much improved.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.604
Well, thanks.

10:46.687 --> 10:47.730
You better
get that jersey on.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.231
It's almost show time.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.692
Listen, you've got some size.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.277
How would you like to
play center forward?

10:53.361 --> 10:54.570
{\an3}The dads on the
opposing team

10:54.653 --> 10:58.366
{\an3}can be pretty nasty
down by the goal line.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.578
We know how to handle
bullies, don't we?

11:02.661 --> 11:03.871
Yeah!

11:03.954 --> 11:05.331
{\an1}(laughing)

11:05.414 --> 11:06.832
Come on.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.588
Iced tea, two sugars.

11:12.671 --> 11:15.257
{\an1}You've been in twice,
that makes you a regular.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.050
{\an1}I don't even know
my own name

11:16.133 --> 11:17.593
{\an1}until I've had
two cups of coffee.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.970
Well, I used to be like that.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.723
{\an3}But I'm trying to cut down
on caffeine.

11:22.807 --> 11:23.766
That's too healthy for me.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.060
I need that extra
kick in the head.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.604
Especially trying to keep up
with a very active six year old.

11:28.687 --> 11:29.855
You have a six year old?

11:30.689 --> 11:31.941
But you're so young.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.651
Thanks, that's sweet.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.945
The truth is,
I feel like I've aged,

11:36.028 --> 11:38.572
like, five years
to every one of his.

11:38.656 --> 11:41.325
But I bet you have help, huh?

11:41.409 --> 11:43.452
Help? Did you say help?

11:43.536 --> 11:46.080
{\an1}Uh-uh. You're looking
at all the help I've got.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.791
I'm what the statistics
would call a single mom.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.501
I'm sorry, I just
assumed that...

11:50.584 --> 11:51.836
No, it's okay.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.587
{\an1}Really,
it's not a big deal.

11:53.671 --> 11:54.588
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.759
Carly, we gotta keep the
trains moving, come on.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.637
I'm sorry, I'm keeping you.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.139
{\an1}It's okay.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.600
I don't mean to get personal
but, uh, are you okay?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.102
No.

12:08.185 --> 12:10.020
No, I've got some
things that I'm...

12:10.104 --> 12:12.773
trying to deal with right now.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.733
I don't know, I thought
if I came here...

12:15.901 --> 12:17.945
I don't know what
I was thinking.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.176
{\an3}That male prostitute
over there might know her.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.261
{\an3}He's always
working this corner.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.478
Hey, how you doing?

12:50.561 --> 12:52.146
Like you care.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.315
I'm looking for somebody.
Who isn't?

12:54.398 --> 12:56.567
It's going to cost.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.360
Yeah, here you go.

12:58.444 --> 12:59.570
You kidding?

12:59.653 --> 13:01.864
Why don't you take your sorry
ass back where you came from?

13:01.947 --> 13:04.909
Will this cover it?

13:04.992 --> 13:07.036
You know her?

13:07.119 --> 13:09.413
Yeah, I know her.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.664
Haven't seen her around lately.

13:10.748 --> 13:11.832
Where does she stay?

13:11.916 --> 13:14.710
She doesn't stay.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.546
Let's go, Brandon, he's
just taking your money.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.839
Look, here's my card.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.925
{\an5}I need an hour
of your time.
You kidding?

13:21.008 --> 13:22.551
I'm serious.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.428
It takes all kinds.

13:25.804 --> 13:26.722
So, what are you into?

13:26.805 --> 13:28.474
Information.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.022
Andy. Pam.

13:35.105 --> 13:36.106
I need an assist pronto.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.399
What's up?

13:37.483 --> 13:39.568
{\an1}Nothing, man.
I'm out of here.

13:42.112 --> 13:44.573
Why, if it isn't
the Welcome Wagon.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.741
And who are you?

13:45.824 --> 13:48.077
I'm the big bad wolf.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.583
Excuse me, Mr. Wolf,

13:54.667 --> 13:56.669
I'm looking for somebody.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.296
You know her?

13:59.380 --> 14:02.299
She's a real piece, huh?

14:02.383 --> 14:04.093
Where is she?

14:04.176 --> 14:06.428
She's gone.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.596
We'll miss her.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.640
{\an1}Let's go.
Brandon, Kelly, come on.

14:09.723 --> 14:11.016
Wait.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.810
What do you mean, she's gone?

14:12.893 --> 14:14.937
I mean where she is
she don't want to be found.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.730
Now, go home!

14:16.814 --> 14:18.857
We're through playing
cops and robbers for today.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.276
You made your point, Riggs.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.903
Brandon, Kelly,
come on-- now.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.946
You know where she is.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.864
{\an3}You're her pimp,
aren't you?

14:25.948 --> 14:27.908
Ooh, pretty and smart.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.415
You just made
a big mistake, boy.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.166
Brandon...

14:38.586 --> 14:39.670
{\an1}(siren whoops)
Riggs...

14:48.887 --> 14:52.725
{\an3}Next time I tell you guys
to move, you guys move.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.233
{\an3}OFFICER:
You call for assistance?

15:14.788 --> 15:15.914
I'm sorry about
the soccer game.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.042
{\an3}I had no idea it was
a father-kid game.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.376
It's not your fault.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.794
I didn't say
that it was.

15:20.878 --> 15:21.837
Just that I feel bad.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.673
I mean, Zach put you in
a very awkward position.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.091
He's a six-year-old kid.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.177
He wants to be just
like the other boys.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.970
But?

15:30.054 --> 15:32.806
I think I'd be lying to you
if I told you it felt right.

15:32.890 --> 15:36.977
{\an1}I mean, Zach's
a great kid; great kid.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.021
It's just...

15:39.104 --> 15:40.147
Well, he's...

15:40.230 --> 15:41.690
Not your kid.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.985
Other than saying
I'm sorry and that

15:45.069 --> 15:47.863
it'll never
happen again, I...

15:47.946 --> 15:48.864
I don't know what to say.

15:48.947 --> 15:50.032
Nothing else to say.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.700
It's a done deal, right?

15:51.784 --> 15:54.953
Well, how come it feels
like something's changed...

15:56.622 --> 15:58.999
...like, suddenly,
everything's different?

16:06.965 --> 16:10.052
Hey, is that
what I think it is?

16:10.135 --> 16:11.553
{\an1}BRANDON:
Dim sum and then some.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.346
There's enough
for everybody.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.264
{\an3}Wow!
Mm, thanks.

16:14.348 --> 16:17.059
{\an3}As soon as I'm done
with this layout.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.769
{\an1}So what's the
special occasion?

16:18.852 --> 16:21.230
{\an3}None, I was just
in the neighborhood

16:21.313 --> 16:22.856
and thought
I'd drop by.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.191
Mm-hmm.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.694
You don't just drop by, Val.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.196
What, now you?

16:29.279 --> 16:31.949
{\an3}Why is everybody so suspicious
of me all the time, huh?

16:32.032 --> 16:35.077
{\an1}Why?
Because you've earned it.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.583
What happened,
did you go see Noah?

16:41.667 --> 16:43.961
What the hell was
I thinking, huh?

16:44.044 --> 16:46.255
I mean, that'll teach me.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.758
Stick to your rules, Val,
you know better than that.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.635
Better than what?
You weren't exactly honest

16:51.719 --> 16:53.762
with the guy, Val.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.597
Noah likes a little
honesty with his women.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.599
{\an3}I went by there to
tell him about Cooper.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.101
I did.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.478
(sighs)

17:01.562 --> 17:02.980
It just got away from me.

17:03.063 --> 17:05.273
Kind of like Noah.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.733
{\an3}What am I
going to do?

17:06.817 --> 17:09.319
I don't... I don't like
feeling like this.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.241
I mean, it's really
hard to describe but...

17:14.324 --> 17:15.867
It hurts.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.368
Yeah.

17:25.042 --> 17:28.297
I like this one.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.299
And this one.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.800
I love them all.

17:31.884 --> 17:32.259
How long have you
been doing this?

17:32.342 --> 17:33.135
Uh, not very.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.595
Well, you're a natural.

17:34.678 --> 17:35.929
{\an1}You pick.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.765
{\an3}Really? Oh!
Thanks!

17:37.848 --> 17:39.808
{\an3}Vicki, why don't you
try this one on.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.269
You are definitely
in your element.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.979
{\an3}Oh, yeah-- only
18 minor meltdowns,

17:44.062 --> 17:45.981
but nothing big so far.

17:46.064 --> 17:47.941
{\an3}Are you sure that it
was Erica you saw?

17:48.025 --> 17:51.862
{\an1}Well, Brandon was
face-to-face with her.

17:51.945 --> 17:54.323
But when we went back yesterday,
she was nowhere to be seen.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.866
{\an1}We found her pimp
but not her.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.451
And so I guess we
just keep looking.

17:57.534 --> 17:58.535
Yeah.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.789
Where's David?

18:01.872 --> 18:04.041
{\an3}Well, he offered to help,
so I took him up on it.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.959
{\an3}I told him to stay
out of the way.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.836
You know he'd freak
out if an assistant

18:07.920 --> 18:10.964
scraped the bar, broke a
light or bumped a chair.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.508
{\an3}This club means
everything to him.

18:12.591 --> 18:13.801
(sympathetic groan)

18:14.968 --> 18:16.804
Obviously not everything.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.057
{\an3}Can you grab that?
Yeah.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.683
{\an1}KELLY:
You know, I'm really glad

18:21.767 --> 18:23.727
things are better
for you guys.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.396
{\an1}Well, it helps
just being near him.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.148
And tonight I plan on
being very near him.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.776
Very near him.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.361
{\an1}Oh, really?
Nothing major.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.071
Just everything.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.823
You know, me and David,
dinner, candles.

18:35.906 --> 18:36.824
New lingerie.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.075
It's just been

18:38.158 --> 18:39.701
kind of rough for us lately.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.579
Well, it sounds like you have
planned the perfect evening

18:42.663 --> 18:43.872
to get everything back on track.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.166
I sure hope so.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.209
(knocking on door)

18:47.292 --> 18:49.378
{\an1}Yeah?

18:49.461 --> 18:51.213
Hey, you subletting
the club now?

18:51.296 --> 18:53.924
Anything to pay the bills.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.968
I got you a meeting
with Everett Sands,

18:56.051 --> 18:57.344
that loan guy
I was telling you about.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.929
{\an3}He'll take good
care of you.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.305
Great. When?

19:00.389 --> 19:01.890
Tonight at 7:00, at Parson's.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.892
{\an3}It's on Sunset.
I can't.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.018
I'm seeing Donna tonight.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.270
So? She'll understand.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.729
She knows how slow it's been.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.065
Yeah, but not how bad
or for how long.

19:10.148 --> 19:11.400
Why not?

19:11.483 --> 19:12.901
{\an1}How exactly do you
say that to somebody?

19:12.985 --> 19:14.528
You know?

19:14.611 --> 19:16.196
"I'm sorry, honey,
but you're living with a loser

19:16.280 --> 19:17.739
"and you're not gonna
be seeing him tonight

19:17.823 --> 19:18.907
because he's meeting
with a loan shark."

19:18.991 --> 19:20.659
That's a hell of a way
of putting it.

19:20.742 --> 19:21.618
It's the truth.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.078
Can't your guy reschedule?

19:25.539 --> 19:27.249
Hey, he's doing you a favor.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.625
Don't push it.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.298
Thanks for the tour, Pam.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.924
You know, I don't think the
executives at the foundation

19:36.008 --> 19:37.926
{\an1}have any idea what a
great job you're doing

19:38.010 --> 19:39.887
{\an1}getting these kids
off the streets.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.430
That's because they
don't want to know.

19:41.513 --> 19:45.058
It's one of society's
dirty little secrets.

19:46.518 --> 19:49.605
Some of these kids are not
even out of their teens yet

19:49.688 --> 19:51.481
and they're out in the streets

19:51.565 --> 19:53.525
selling their bodies
just to survive.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.485
{\an1}That's a horrible
way to live.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.779
{\an1}PAM: They don't live,
they exist.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.781
It's a cruel world, Kelly.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.950
And many of these kids
don't survive it.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.327
Erica?

20:03.410 --> 20:06.121
She's no different
than the others.

20:06.204 --> 20:08.290
If it's not the drugs
or her pimp,

20:08.373 --> 20:10.334
one day, she's going to
get into the wrong car

20:10.417 --> 20:11.293
with the wrong guy.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.795
We have to do something;
we have to find her.

20:13.879 --> 20:14.922
Well, we're trying.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.798
We work very closely
with the LAPD,

20:16.882 --> 20:18.216
the sheriff's department,

20:18.300 --> 20:19.760
county social services.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.471
My guess is she'll
surface pretty soon.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.474
I hope so.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.517
Well, Brandon and I
will keep looking.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.977
{\an3}Kelly?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.271
I can't stop you,

20:31.355 --> 20:32.814
but what I said
yesterday, I meant.

20:32.898 --> 20:33.690
The streets are dangerous

20:33.774 --> 20:35.442
if you don't know
what you're doing.

20:35.525 --> 20:36.693
It's a concrete jungle

20:36.777 --> 20:38.862
{\an3}with its own language,
its own rules.

20:38.946 --> 20:42.824
You violate those rules and
you could get hurt, badly.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.619
{\an3}If you hear from Erica,
please, call me.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.788
Let me handle it.
I know the rules.

20:47.871 --> 20:48.872
Yeah, I will.

20:48.956 --> 20:53.835
It's just Brandon has his
own way of doing things.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.254
His own ways
could get him killed.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.643
Hi, can I help you?

21:09.726 --> 21:10.978
{\an3}Yeah.

21:11.061 --> 21:14.690
{\an1}Uh, Brandon, uh, is this
gentleman here to see you?

21:14.773 --> 21:18.068
Yeah... thanks for coming.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.529
Yeah, right.
50 bucks, now.

21:20.612 --> 21:21.697
This better be worth it.

21:21.780 --> 21:22.698
Don't sweat it.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.491
{\an3}You know where she is?
Yep.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.953
{\an3}Let's go.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.205
Let me ask you something.

21:30.288 --> 21:31.873
{\an1}Ask away,
it's your cash.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.667
Why do you do it?

21:33.750 --> 21:35.210
Why don't you leave,
get off the street?

21:35.293 --> 21:36.378
And go where?

21:36.461 --> 21:37.504
You don't have a family?

21:37.587 --> 21:39.881
That's a joke.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.967
Don't you ever worry
you might end up dead

21:42.050 --> 21:44.094
doing what you're doing?

21:44.177 --> 21:45.887
I already am.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.058
Kel, he, uh,
he found Erica.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.768
Well, I'll call Pam.

21:51.852 --> 21:52.769
Can we get out of here?

21:52.853 --> 21:54.396
Why should we trust you?

21:54.479 --> 21:57.315
Got a choice?

22:18.670 --> 22:19.629
{\an1}It's only me.
It's okay.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.631
Where's Riggs?

22:21.715 --> 22:23.759
He's gone for a while. Come on,
get up-- let's get out of here.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.595
I'm too tired.
Got anything to eat?

22:26.678 --> 22:28.055
Mm-mm.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.100
What's going on?
What are they...

22:32.184 --> 22:33.810
You bought them here?

22:33.894 --> 22:35.812
Erica, it's okay.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.230
It's all right.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.774
What happened?
Did somebody hit you?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.734
{\an1}RICKY:
Riggs. Her pimp.

22:40.817 --> 22:41.777
You can get out.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.612
You got a way out.

22:43.695 --> 22:44.780
These people want you.

22:44.863 --> 22:45.947
{\an3}For now.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.240
Does Dylan know?

22:47.324 --> 22:48.909
{\an3}KELLY:
We talked to Brenda

22:48.992 --> 22:51.453
and we tried to call
your stepmom in Hawaii.

22:51.536 --> 22:52.996
So Iris hasn't called you yet?

22:53.080 --> 22:54.873
{\an3}She will.
I don't want her

22:54.956 --> 22:56.375
to see me; I don't want her
to know about me;

22:56.458 --> 22:57.584
and I am not going
to any shelter.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.211
You got that?

23:01.338 --> 23:02.798
Riggs will find me there.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.801
He'll kill me.

23:05.884 --> 23:09.763
You're not staying
in a shelter, Erica.

23:09.846 --> 23:12.140
You're going to stay with us.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.017
Do you promise me
you won't tell Dylan?

23:15.519 --> 23:17.521
Come on, let's go.

23:21.399 --> 23:23.693
{\an1}BRANDON:
Let's go.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.123
Hey.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.624
You find the girl?

23:37.707 --> 23:39.668
Yeah, yeah-- Kel's getting her
settled in at the house.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.002
Oh.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.337
What's the matter with him?

23:42.420 --> 23:46.758
His body's here, but his
mind... I have no idea.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.679
Tell Dr. Walsh
where it hurts.

23:52.722 --> 23:53.974
Zach.
Zach?

23:54.057 --> 23:55.308
Zach.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.269
{\an3}The little squirt
shanghaied me.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.646
{\an3}He brought me to a
father-son soccer game.

23:59.729 --> 24:01.148
Ouch.
Ouch.

24:01.231 --> 24:03.150
{\an3}All these people kept
saying things like,

24:03.233 --> 24:05.527
{\an3}"I didn't even
know he had a dad."

24:05.610 --> 24:08.155
Like I was some kind of jerk
for not having been around.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.157
{\an6}It's not your fault, man.
I know it's
not my fault,

24:10.240 --> 24:12.200
{\an3}but it wasn't supposed
to be like this.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.703
I was gonna play the field,
remember?

24:14.786 --> 24:16.371
A different girl every night.

24:16.454 --> 24:18.373
But Carly changed all that.

24:18.456 --> 24:20.041
I'm crazy about her.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.252
When I'm with her, I never want
to leave; when we're apart,

24:22.335 --> 24:24.838
{\an3}I can't stop thinking about
when I'll see her again.

24:24.921 --> 24:27.174
We've even thought about...

24:27.257 --> 24:28.466
Sex?

24:30.051 --> 24:31.052
You haven't...?

24:31.136 --> 24:33.054
Not yet.

24:33.138 --> 24:36.474
But you're gonna.
I think soon.

24:44.482 --> 24:46.484
(phone ringing)

24:48.486 --> 24:50.405
Hello?

24:50.488 --> 24:53.116
Donna, hey,
did you get my message?

24:53.200 --> 24:54.367
No,
I haven't checked the messages.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.786
My shoot wrapped and I had a few
errands to run for tonight.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.246
See you at 8:00, right?

24:58.330 --> 25:01.041
Yeah, look,
I might be a little late.

25:01.124 --> 25:02.459
David... (groans)

25:02.542 --> 25:03.919
What's gonna keep you, the club?

25:04.002 --> 25:05.128
Yeah.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.922
I'm meeting with this investor.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.965
What kind of investor
meets you at this hour?

25:09.049 --> 25:12.761
He's just some business guy.
He's running a little late.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.596
What, you're going to go into
business with someone else?

25:14.679 --> 25:15.931
Who is this guy?

25:16.014 --> 25:17.140
Just wait for me, okay?

25:17.224 --> 25:17.974
Have a little faith.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.976
I do.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.937
I love you.
DONNA: I love you, too.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.063
Good-bye.

25:26.399 --> 25:27.734
SALESWOMAN:
<i>It's perfect.</i>

25:27.817 --> 25:29.110
He'll love it.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.403
{\an3}I hope so.

25:30.487 --> 25:31.905
{\an3}I hope I'm not keeping
you too late.

25:31.988 --> 25:32.948
{\an3}I just want everything
to be perfect.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.950
{\an1}Oh, we're open
another half hour.

25:35.033 --> 25:35.909
Besides, something tells me

25:35.992 --> 25:38.119
{\an1}the best part of your evening
is yet to come.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.415
Thanks.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.959
(beeps)

25:44.042 --> 25:46.294
SALESWOMAN 2 (in distance):
We also have these, if you like.

25:46.378 --> 25:49.673
(machine whirs and beeps)

25:49.756 --> 25:52.092
Would you rather pay
by credit card?

25:52.175 --> 25:54.135
Is something wrong
with the check?

25:54.219 --> 25:54.970
It's not clearing.

25:55.053 --> 25:57.764
I couldn't possibly
be overdrawn.

25:57.847 --> 25:58.974
There must be some mistake.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.392
I'm afraid not.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.234
(doorbell rings)

26:12.362 --> 26:14.864
I gotta talk to you.

26:14.948 --> 26:16.032
Hi, Carly. How are you?
Did you have a nice day?

26:16.116 --> 26:17.284
I'll get to that later.

26:17.367 --> 26:20.287
Right now, let me just
keep it simple, okay?

26:20.370 --> 26:23.039
{\an1}I was a jerk yesterday
and I'm sorry.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.332
{\an3}You didn't do
anything wrong.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.001
I freaked out.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.128
It's okay.
It's not okay.

26:28.211 --> 26:30.797
Look, I'm not a mind reader
and I can't predict the future.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.674
{\an1}I can't even tell you what
I'm gonna have for breakfast

26:32.757 --> 26:35.802
tomorrow morning, but I do know
that I want you there.

26:35.885 --> 26:37.262
Both you and Zach.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.399
Do you really mean that?

26:49.482 --> 26:51.026
I'm positive.

26:51.109 --> 26:54.321
Because Zach and I...
I mean, we're a team,

26:54.404 --> 26:58.074
{\an3}and I totally understand
if that's too much for you.

27:01.244 --> 27:03.079
I want you both.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.794
{\an3}You don't know how happy
I am to hear you say that.

27:20.096 --> 27:22.057
{\an1}Maybe you'd like me
to recommend?

27:22.140 --> 27:25.560
{\an3}No, thanks.
I can't stay.

27:25.643 --> 27:27.896
{\an1}I thought this
was important to you.

27:27.979 --> 27:32.067
{\an1}Ernie, bring him
the New York strip steak.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.902
And I'll have
the poached salmon,

27:33.985 --> 27:35.236
no butter on the potatoes.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.156
Everything in moderation.

27:38.239 --> 27:40.241
I've got to make a phone call.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.618
{\an1}No, what you've
got to do, David,

27:41.701 --> 27:42.911
is come to terms with the fact

27:42.994 --> 27:44.746
that your life
has spun out of control.

27:44.829 --> 27:48.083
{\an1}Now, you want help,
I'll help you.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.709
But I need your attention here.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.169
{\an3}You showed up
over an hour late.

27:51.252 --> 27:53.129
You don't care
about my business.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.673
What, do you just enjoy
jerking me around?

27:55.757 --> 27:57.217
You're not gonna lose
your business.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.094
Don't lose your sense of humor.

27:59.177 --> 28:01.346
{\an1}I wish you luck
on your club, I really do.

28:01.429 --> 28:04.099
{\an1}But I don't care
what you do with my money.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.351
Well, you know, just so
long as you pay it back.

28:06.434 --> 28:07.936
With interest.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.312
What interest?

28:09.396 --> 28:11.731
50%... per month.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.608
{\an1}What?
Yeah, you heard right.

28:13.691 --> 28:15.068
And it adds up.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.570
Which is why I encourage
early repayment.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.824
How much do you need?

28:22.158 --> 28:22.992
Ten grand.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.328
{\an1}All right. So next month,
you'll owe me 15.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.247
You can manage that.

28:27.330 --> 28:29.624
{\an1}How much do you owe
on your credit cards,

28:29.707 --> 28:32.168
{\an1}towards your lease,
to your friends?

28:32.252 --> 28:33.753
Enough.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.130
Yeah, well, they don't
stay friends very long

28:35.213 --> 28:37.132
{\an1}when you start hitting
them up for cash.

28:37.215 --> 28:40.385
Now me, I'm not a friend.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.179
Remember that.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.504
David forged my name.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.341
(sighs)

29:31.102 --> 29:32.896
{\an3}STEVE:
Well, here it is.

29:32.979 --> 29:36.191
{\an3}It's not the Ritz,
but it's home.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.276
Mm-hmm.

29:43.156 --> 29:45.033
So, we're finally alone.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.078
{\an3}You know, Carly,
Zach's a...

29:49.162 --> 29:52.415
{\an3}babysitter; doesn't she need
to get home or anything?

29:52.499 --> 29:54.542
{\an3}Uh...

29:56.336 --> 29:57.795
We shouldn't rush into this,

29:57.879 --> 30:01.216
{\an3}I mean, being that
it's our first time.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.218
We should just...

30:03.301 --> 30:08.264
take our time and...
and ease into this.

30:13.311 --> 30:14.062
So, what do you think?

30:14.145 --> 30:17.232
{\an1}I think you have
a lot of good qualities,

30:17.315 --> 30:23.196
{\an1}but knowing when
to shut up isn't one of them.

30:23.279 --> 30:24.906
So you want to, huh?

30:24.989 --> 30:26.074
Yeah, I want to.

30:26.157 --> 30:29.202
Unless you don't.
No, I do, I do.

30:29.285 --> 30:32.288
Good, then it requires
no more conversation.

30:41.297 --> 30:43.341
(passing car horn honking)

30:45.260 --> 30:46.427
Georgie, one more long neck.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.221
{\an1}MARGO:
Sweetie, come on.

30:48.304 --> 30:49.055
I think you had enough.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.598
{\an1}Just one more.
Come on. I'll show you.

30:50.682 --> 30:51.933
This is Mozart.

30:53.351 --> 30:56.271
One more makes
for the octave.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.231
{\an3}Hey, Mozart, enough
with the racket already.

30:58.314 --> 31:00.441
What? You don't like good music?
Listen, pal,

31:00.525 --> 31:02.777
I got one nerve left
and you're working that good.

31:02.860 --> 31:05.113
Now, quit the banging
or get the hell out of here.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.282
I suppose that makes you
some kind of music critic.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.450
{\an3}Come on, honey.
Don't start nothing.

31:09.534 --> 31:10.743
Yeah, listen to the bitch.

31:11.578 --> 31:12.537
Apologize to the lady.

31:12.620 --> 31:14.122
{\an3}No, don't.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.207
Oh!

31:16.291 --> 31:17.166
I said apologize to the lady.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.128
{\an1}That's it.

31:20.211 --> 31:23.131
(dialing phone)
911? Send someone over here.

31:23.214 --> 31:27.176
{\an5}GEORGIE:
The Hangin' Inn,
1115 Dowell Street.

31:27.260 --> 31:29.178
(glass breaking,
Noah and man grunting)

31:29.262 --> 31:32.140
It's a bar.
We got a fight brewing here.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.101
Where is she?

31:35.184 --> 31:36.644
{\an3}Shower.
I think someone

31:36.728 --> 31:37.979
should stay home
with her tomorrow.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.732
I mean, she's still too scared
to be alone.

31:40.815 --> 31:41.649
Is that what she said?

31:41.733 --> 31:43.651
No, but it's pretty obvious.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.361
What's obvious, Brandon,

31:45.445 --> 31:47.280
is that you think you know
what's going on in her head,

31:47.363 --> 31:48.781
but you have no idea.
Neither do I.

31:48.865 --> 31:49.991
Wait a minute.

31:50.074 --> 31:51.326
We finally find Erica,

31:51.409 --> 31:53.036
and you make it sound
like it's a bad thing.

31:53.119 --> 31:57.373
No, I'm not. It's just, we never
really thought this through.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.667
One day, we see her
at a street light,

31:59.751 --> 32:01.961
{\an1}and the next,
she's been beaten by her pimp

32:02.045 --> 32:03.671
{\an1}and she's sleeping
on our couch.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.548
{\an1}Yeah, so?
So, we're just treating her

32:05.632 --> 32:08.217
like she's some kind of
overnight guest or something.

32:08.301 --> 32:11.012
Kel,
let's just let her be, okay?

32:11.095 --> 32:13.014
I want her
to feel like she can trust us.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.016
I-I want her to feel safe.

32:15.099 --> 32:17.143
So do I.

32:17.226 --> 32:18.728
It's just
that I don't feel safe.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.647
What is there not
to feel safe about?

32:20.730 --> 32:22.690
She's a 16-year-old girl.

32:22.774 --> 32:26.027
That's just it. When I was 16,
I was worried about

32:26.110 --> 32:27.737
what I was gonna wear
to school the next day

32:27.820 --> 32:29.197
or what boy I had a crush on.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.240
And what boy
did you have a crush on?

32:31.324 --> 32:33.868
{\an1}Brandon, I'm not kidding,
all right?

32:33.951 --> 32:35.912
{\an1}I just think that we
are way out of our league.

32:35.995 --> 32:38.039
Maybe Pam was right.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.874
That little girl
that we once knew

32:39.957 --> 32:41.584
is pretty much gone forever.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.544
Okay. Why don't you ask Pam

32:43.628 --> 32:45.088
{\an3}if she can come over
here tomorrow after work.

32:45.171 --> 32:46.881
{\an3}The three of us will sit down
and figure something out.

32:46.964 --> 32:49.717
{\an5}BRANDON:
We did promise her she wouldn't
have to go to a shelter.

32:49.801 --> 32:53.680
{\an4}KELLY:
But what if that's
the best thing for her?

32:53.763 --> 32:55.264
(phone ringing)

32:56.974 --> 32:59.560
Yeah?

32:59.644 --> 33:00.770
Really?

33:00.853 --> 33:02.563
I'm on my way.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.107
What?

33:04.190 --> 33:05.650
Noah's been arrested.

33:10.363 --> 33:11.781
(sighs)

33:13.866 --> 33:17.412
{\an3}Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, easy, big fella.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.539
(grunts and sighs)

33:19.622 --> 33:23.376
Six more steps
and I'm home free.

33:23.459 --> 33:25.420
Hey, thanks
for the assist, amigo.

33:25.503 --> 33:26.671
Yeah.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.715
Let me get my check
book for that bail.

33:28.798 --> 33:29.882
No, no, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

33:29.966 --> 33:33.261
{\an3}No, no, no, it's okay.
Tomorrow's fine.

33:33.344 --> 33:34.762
(sighs)

33:34.846 --> 33:36.597
{\an3}Listen, whatever's
going on with you, man,

33:36.681 --> 33:39.100
{\an3}I don't think you're gonna
solve it by using your fists.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.269
I know, man.
I can't help it.

33:41.352 --> 33:46.607
I feel like I'm swinging
at ghosts and shadows.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.735
It's not helping a damn bit.

33:48.818 --> 33:51.654
You want another beer?

33:51.738 --> 33:54.782
No, thanks. I'm fine.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.909
Me, neither.

33:58.244 --> 33:59.620
(sighs)

33:59.704 --> 34:01.497
It's ghosts and shadows, man.

34:01.581 --> 34:04.125
Today's a very special day.

34:04.208 --> 34:05.710
A birthday?

34:05.793 --> 34:08.254
A death day.

34:08.337 --> 34:10.089
What are you talking about?

34:10.172 --> 34:14.177
A year ago today,
I killed my fiancée, man.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.511
{\an3}I was in my car
and I was driving

34:15.594 --> 34:16.721
{\an3}and I had a beer,
you know,

34:16.804 --> 34:19.639
I got reckless. I was just
trying to get away from them.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.310
She was bleeding
all over me, man.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.978
I was trapped
and I couldn't get to her.

34:25.062 --> 34:27.190
I tried to get to her, I just...

34:27.273 --> 34:28.815
Man, I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.318
I guess that's why

34:30.400 --> 34:31.944
when Kelly got shot,

34:32.027 --> 34:33.362
and she was bleeding,
I just wanted to...

34:33.446 --> 34:35.156
{\an1}Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry about it.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.657
Who were you running from?

34:36.741 --> 34:38.451
My life. My family.

34:38.534 --> 34:40.161
My father.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.496
Beth wasn't good enough
for none of them, you know.

34:42.580 --> 34:43.581
She didn't come
from the right family.

34:43.664 --> 34:46.708
In my house, you got to come
from the right family.

34:46.793 --> 34:47.668
It's like some cardinal rule.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.338
You lost me on that one.

34:50.420 --> 34:51.547
{\an3}You remember a
couple of weeks ago

34:51.630 --> 34:54.509
when me, you, Steve and David
went looking for that band?

34:54.592 --> 34:55.510
Yeah.

34:55.592 --> 34:56.636
And Steve was being so subtle

34:56.719 --> 34:57.845
about trying to pump me

34:57.929 --> 35:00.056
{\an3}for information?
Yeah.

35:00.139 --> 35:02.099
I was telling you guys
the truth.

35:02.183 --> 35:05.228
You were feeding Steve some line

35:05.311 --> 35:07.396
about you coming
from a rich family.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.523
I never said rich.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.316
Incredibly wealthy.

35:10.399 --> 35:12.527
{\an3}I mean, rich is what you
got here in Beverly Hills.

35:12.610 --> 35:15.863
Rich was Beth's family.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.698
But you were kidding,
weren't you?

35:17.782 --> 35:21.869
No. Uh-uh. You ever heard
of Hunter Oil and Chemical?

35:21.953 --> 35:25.248
Yeah, sure. They're
a Fortune 500 company.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.084
You're one of those Hunters?

35:28.167 --> 35:29.377
It's crazy, isn't it?

35:29.460 --> 35:30.711
And my trust fund's

35:30.795 --> 35:32.547
kicking into high gear.
I got millions.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.675
Millions, man.
I could care less.

35:35.758 --> 35:37.677
Wow.

35:37.760 --> 35:40.388
Look, Brandon, I'd appreciate
you not telling anybody

35:40.471 --> 35:41.722
about this, okay?

35:41.806 --> 35:43.516
Yeah. Sure, man. No problem.

35:43.599 --> 35:45.518
If I knew the words to say

35:45.601 --> 35:48.104
to make you feel any better
about Beth...

35:48.187 --> 35:49.564
I'd say them.

35:49.647 --> 35:50.898
I know you would, man.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.733
Thanks.

35:57.154 --> 35:59.574
{\an1}Hi. Have fun,
you kiddies, huh?

35:59.657 --> 36:01.409
Uh, more
than you can imagine.

36:01.492 --> 36:02.743
(doorbell rings)

36:02.827 --> 36:04.745
You have no idea
what I can imagine.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.581
(sighs) Hmm.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.416
Uh, can I help you?

36:08.499 --> 36:10.042
Well, I'm looking for...

36:10.126 --> 36:11.711
Jodi?
Jodi?

36:11.794 --> 36:14.589
{\an5}JODI:
I'm sorry to come by so late
without calling.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.591
I really need to talk to you.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.926
{\an3}This is my
girlfriend Carly.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.386
We've met.

36:20.469 --> 36:22.263
{\an1}Yeah, um,
she's a regular

36:22.346 --> 36:24.265
at the diner, but...

36:24.348 --> 36:26.058
{\an1}I didn't know
you guys knew each other.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.978
{\an3}Well, we dated a couple times
before you and I met.

36:29.061 --> 36:30.229
JODI:
Isn't this weird?

36:30.313 --> 36:32.315
I had no idea you two...

36:33.733 --> 36:35.067
You know, maybe
this isn't such a good idea.

36:35.151 --> 36:37.320
No, come on in. What's up?

36:37.403 --> 36:39.405
Uh, maybe this should wait.

36:39.488 --> 36:42.283
No, I really can't
wait any longer.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.327
Well, there's no time
like the present.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.288
See, I didn't want to say
anything until I was sure.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.749
{\an3}I mean,
absolutely sure.

36:49.832 --> 36:53.586
And then I was trying
to decide what to do.

36:53.669 --> 36:57.840
The thing is, Steve...
I'm pregnant,

36:59.383 --> 37:00.676
...and you're the father.

37:12.897 --> 37:16.484
Hey, do you want
something to eat?

37:16.567 --> 37:17.985
You didn't have anything
last night.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.529
No, thanks.
Just some juice, maybe.

37:20.613 --> 37:22.198
Yeah.

37:22.281 --> 37:25.326
{\an1}Valerie will be here today
if you need anything.

37:25.409 --> 37:26.869
Uh-huh.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.496
What's wrong, Erica?

37:28.579 --> 37:29.789
Nothing.

37:29.872 --> 37:31.666
I'm just not stupid, okay?

37:31.749 --> 37:33.292
{\an1}I know
why Val is staying.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.503
Someone needs to play warden
to the hooker.

37:35.586 --> 37:37.838
{\an3}Nobody said you
were stupid, Erica.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.091
Valerie's staying here
so that you'll be safe.

37:40.174 --> 37:41.342
Yeah, right.

37:41.425 --> 37:43.469
Look, guys, you go ahead.
She'll be fine.

37:43.552 --> 37:46.681
We've been through
some tough times together, huh?

37:46.764 --> 37:48.641
All right.
Thanks, Val.

37:48.724 --> 37:49.809
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

37:49.892 --> 37:50.810
{\an3}Bye.
Bye.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.895
{\an1}See you.
See you guys later.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.194
You know, you don't have
to stick around for my benefit.

38:00.277 --> 38:01.737
I'm quite fine on my own.

38:01.821 --> 38:04.031
Mm, maybe I just want
to talk to you.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.908
{\an3}About what?
I don't know.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.410
About how you're feeling.

38:07.493 --> 38:08.911
Valerie, do you remember

38:08.995 --> 38:10.830
when you and Dylan
came down to Mexico

38:10.913 --> 38:13.040
to get me from my mom
and my step dad?

38:13.124 --> 38:14.208
Yeah.

38:14.291 --> 38:16.752
Well, I was really happy
to see you then.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.672
Me, too.
And I'm happy to see you now.

38:19.755 --> 38:21.549
How could you be?

38:21.632 --> 38:23.342
I mean, look at me.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.094
I'm nothing.

38:25.177 --> 38:27.722
You've made some bad choices
and you've done some things

38:27.805 --> 38:31.225
that you're not proud of, but
that doesn't make you nothing.

38:31.308 --> 38:32.560
You really believe that?

38:32.643 --> 38:34.061
Yeah, I do.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.438
{\an3}I mean, I've done
some things

38:35.521 --> 38:36.939
{\an3}that I'm not
proud of either,

38:37.023 --> 38:39.567
but at the end of the day,
I'm all I've got.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.360
I'm not going to beat myself up
about it.

38:41.444 --> 38:43.946
Well, I guess I found someone
to do that for me.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.906
Your pimp.
Yeah.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.533
You got to get rid of him.

38:47.616 --> 38:48.909
It's not that easy.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.536
Let us help you.

38:50.619 --> 38:51.537
(pager beeping)

38:51.620 --> 38:55.416
{\an4}Saved by
the beep. (sighs)
Mm.

38:55.499 --> 38:57.626
Listen, I forgot I have
an appointment on Rodeo.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.545
Um, why don't you come with me?

38:59.628 --> 39:01.172
No, thanks.

39:01.255 --> 39:02.965
{\an1}You go.
I'll be fine here.

39:03.049 --> 39:05.259
I got a lot of talk shows
to catch up on, anyway.

39:05.342 --> 39:07.470
All right, I'll lock up.
You'll be safe.

39:07.553 --> 39:08.679
I'll be back soon, okay?

39:08.763 --> 39:10.806
Don't worry.
I'll be fine.

39:13.392 --> 39:16.270
Hey, listen, my beeper number
is by the phone if you need me.

39:16.353 --> 39:17.605
{\an3}Just go.
Have fun.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.106
I'll be fine. Promise.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.192
Okay.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.636
Hey, Ricky. It's me.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.972
Look, I'll tell you later, okay?

39:52.056 --> 39:56.310
Just get your butt over here.
953 Hillcrest, Beverly Hills.

39:56.393 --> 39:58.437
And move it.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.244
(door opening, gulls calling)

40:19.083 --> 40:21.043
Hey.

40:21.127 --> 40:24.171
{\an1}Where have you been?
I've been worried about you.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.383
{\an3}I stayed at
my parents' last night.

40:27.466 --> 40:29.176
(sighs)

40:31.137 --> 40:33.013
I found the check
that you forged.

40:33.097 --> 40:38.686
{\an1}Look, before you go nuts,
let me explain, okay?

40:38.769 --> 40:41.313
It was just one check and I know
it was for a lot of money,

40:41.397 --> 40:44.400
{\an1}but I was short
and the rent was due and...

40:44.483 --> 40:45.693
{\an1}I was going to say
something, okay?

40:45.776 --> 40:46.861
I just... I forgot.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.947
How could you?

40:50.030 --> 40:53.075
Oh, Donna, we've helped each
other out so many times before.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.702
Where were you last night?

40:54.785 --> 40:57.496
Donna, I was with the investor,
I told you that.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.540
Don't make a bigger deal
out of this than it is.

40:59.623 --> 41:03.544
{\an3}I loved you.
I trusted you.

41:03.627 --> 41:07.047
You're a liar.

41:07.131 --> 41:08.716
{\an3}I don't know where
you were last night.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.886
{\an3}I-I don't know what
you were doing.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.597
{\an1}I was working my ass off
for us, all right?

41:14.680 --> 41:15.890
For both of us.

41:15.973 --> 41:18.726
How did this happen?

41:18.809 --> 41:20.603
{\an1}It was one wrong turn
after another.

41:20.686 --> 41:22.563
{\an3}I meant...

41:22.646 --> 41:24.732
How did this happen to us?

41:24.815 --> 41:28.235
(sighs)

41:28.319 --> 41:31.572
{\an1}You know, you have
this perfect picture

41:31.655 --> 41:34.700
of how life's supposed to be.

41:34.783 --> 41:36.911
{\an1}You finish college,
you work hard.

41:36.994 --> 41:40.915
{\an1}You move in together, and
everything is just perfect.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.584
But then some of the numbers
in that equation fall out,

41:43.667 --> 41:45.085
all right?

41:45.169 --> 41:46.420
The band you're banking on

41:46.503 --> 41:48.380
turns out to be
a bunch of anti-Semitic pigs.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.591
I was proud of you
for walking away from that band.

41:50.674 --> 41:52.760
Yeah, well,
pride didn't pay the rent.

41:52.843 --> 41:55.471
{\an5}(voice cracking):
You could have asked me
for help.

41:55.554 --> 41:57.431
I didn't want to.

41:57.514 --> 41:58.599
I wanted to do it myself.

41:58.682 --> 41:59.725
I wanted you to believe in me.

41:59.808 --> 42:00.935
How?

42:01.018 --> 42:03.729
By stealing from me?

42:03.812 --> 42:05.231
By lying to me?

42:05.314 --> 42:08.734
(sighs) I wanted you
to have faith in me.

42:08.817 --> 42:12.279
{\an1}I mean, how could you
if you knew I was failing?

42:12.363 --> 42:14.615
How can I...

42:14.698 --> 42:17.743
believe anything
that you say now?

42:19.912 --> 42:21.288
I want you to leave.

42:21.372 --> 42:24.333
Donna, no, no.

42:24.416 --> 42:25.960
{\an1}I'll have the money
back to you tomorrow.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.003
{\an3}No, it's not about
the damn money!

42:28.087 --> 42:29.964
{\an3}(sobbing)

42:30.047 --> 42:34.260
{\an3}I just want you to get your
stuff and get out, okay?

42:34.343 --> 42:36.178
{\an3}David, I want you
to get out! Get out.

42:36.262 --> 42:37.638
Let's talk about this.

42:40.933 --> 42:42.935
{\an3}(sobbing)

42:59.368 --> 43:00.953
{\an1}Erica really
isn't talking that much.

43:01.036 --> 43:02.496
No. I think
she's just embarrassed.

43:02.579 --> 43:03.914
Don't kid yourself.

43:03.998 --> 43:07.501
It's going to take a long
time to undo the damage.

43:07.585 --> 43:10.546
Brandon...

43:10.629 --> 43:12.506
{\an1}Brandon,
the computer's gone.

43:12.589 --> 43:14.800
{\an3}Yeah, so are the TV
and the stereo.

43:14.883 --> 43:15.968
BRANDON:
Erica?

43:16.051 --> 43:17.344
{\an3}Val?

43:21.598 --> 43:23.559
Oh, my God.

43:27.980 --> 43:29.690
She took everything.

43:29.773 --> 43:32.109
{\an6}PAM:
I'll see if I can
reach Detective Pate.

43:32.192 --> 43:34.653
Why would she do this?

43:34.737 --> 43:36.530
She was safe here.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.699
That's not our big worry.

43:38.782 --> 43:41.660
{\an1}I think her pimp Riggs
will kill her.

43:41.744 --> 43:42.661
You're not serious.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.955
Dead serious.
