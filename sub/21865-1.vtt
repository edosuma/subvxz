20:22.441 --> 20:23.443
MURTAUGH:
Hey, Bailey.

20:23.443 --> 20:24.645
Murtaugh? Thank God.

20:24.645 --> 20:27.551
Do you have any idea how dead
this place is without you?

20:27.551 --> 20:30.724
Listen, for a concerned citizen,
could you put out a BOLO

20:30.724 --> 20:32.728
for one Gordon Barnes,

20:32.728 --> 20:34.565
born 7/30/79.

20:34.565 --> 20:35.735
Sure. Who is he?

20:35.735 --> 20:38.540
He's a person of interest
in the Tito Flores killing.

20:38.540 --> 20:40.945
Since we're on suspension, we
have to do this under the radar.

20:45.587 --> 20:47.591
Got him.
You looked him up?

20:47.591 --> 20:48.995
No, he's standing
right in front of me.

20:48.995 --> 20:50.832
Sir, can I help you?

20:50.832 --> 20:53.003
Yeah.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.705
I'm here to confess.

20:54.705 --> 20:56.743
I killed Tito Flores.

20:56.743 --> 20:59.148
Okay, Bailey,
don't ask me how I know,

20:59.148 --> 21:02.856
but I think he might know
something about Tito's murder.

21:02.856 --> 21:05.527
Murtaugh, I'm‐a have
to call you back.

21:05.527 --> 21:06.930
Bailey, don't...

21:06.930 --> 21:08.433
She hung up on me?

21:08.433 --> 21:10.938
(car horn honking,
siren wailing)

21:10.938 --> 21:13.009
GORDON: <i>I've been a border agent</i>
<i>for 15 years.</i>

21:13.009 --> 21:17.718
I had a front row seat to
the death, carnage, lives ruined

21:17.718 --> 21:20.090
by drug lords like Flores.

21:20.090 --> 21:22.829
If he went to trial,
he would've walked.

21:22.829 --> 21:24.632
I knew what I had to do.

21:24.632 --> 21:25.968
He did it.

21:25.968 --> 21:27.972
Rewind that back,
that's a confession.

21:27.972 --> 21:29.976
I don't need to rewind it,
I've watched it a dozen times.

21:29.976 --> 21:31.546
I'll present this
to the IA panel,

21:31.546 --> 21:32.849
you should be reinstated
by tomorrow.

21:32.849 --> 21:35.087
Okay. Got my finger back,
got my job back.

21:35.087 --> 21:36.890
Now I got to get my family back,

21:36.890 --> 21:38.861
so I can forget this
nightmare ever happened.

21:38.861 --> 21:39.830
What about your partner?

21:39.830 --> 21:42.134
Before you left,
you said you wanted a new one.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.536
Do you?

21:43.536 --> 21:46.042
The answer to that
will always be yes.

21:46.042 --> 21:47.111
(chuckles)

21:47.111 --> 21:48.480
But it's not
up to me.

21:48.480 --> 21:49.950
He says he's
walking away.

21:49.950 --> 21:51.954
You believe him?

21:56.562 --> 21:58.733
Any questions you got,
I answered.

21:58.733 --> 21:59.970
Your people have been
grilling me all day.

21:59.970 --> 22:02.374
Just one.

22:05.982 --> 22:08.119
What was it like
to kill Tito Flores?

22:08.119 --> 22:10.490
You want to know
how it went down?

22:10.490 --> 22:15.000
I told them already.
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.137
How did it feel?

22:19.575 --> 22:21.847
Look, I'm asking because
I wanted to be the guy.

22:21.847 --> 22:25.086
You know, look into his eyes,
hear his last breath.

22:25.086 --> 22:28.092
And I had this idea in my mind
of how it would feel.

22:28.092 --> 22:30.597
And thanks to you,
I'm never gonna know for sure,

22:30.597 --> 22:33.871
so if you could indulge me.

22:33.871 --> 22:37.177
Oh, well, I don't know.

22:37.177 --> 22:39.248
It happened quick.

22:39.248 --> 22:43.690
All right, well, you got to give
me more than that, I mean...

22:43.690 --> 22:45.995
was it like some inner peace,
like a weight lifted?

22:45.995 --> 22:47.598
I don't know.

22:47.598 --> 22:50.670
Coldness? Come on,
lunatic to lunatic.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.875
I felt like Tito
needed to die

22:52.875 --> 22:53.911
and so he did.

23:02.194 --> 23:03.663
(taps table)

23:03.663 --> 23:05.166
I mean, I would hope
Tito's killer would've been

23:05.166 --> 23:07.804
a little more verbal,
but all right.

28:23.335 --> 28:24.971
I was this close
to getting you reinstated.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.140
Now you want me
to go back in there

28:26.140 --> 28:27.009

we don't have a suspect?

28:27.009 --> 28:29.314
Technically speaking,
Murtaugh and Riggs

28:29.314 --> 28:31.318
are the suspects.
I don't want to
say it again.

28:31.318 --> 28:32.887
We did not kill Tito Flores.

28:32.887 --> 28:36.228

it'd be easier if you had.

Just‐just tell him what you,
uh, what you told me.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.076
I picked the trunk lock.

28:44.076 --> 28:46.848
I shot Tito.
I walked away.

28:46.848 --> 28:48.117
I got chills.

28:48.117 --> 28:49.354
It's as if I was there.

28:49.354 --> 28:50.356
One shot.

28:50.356 --> 28:52.092
Total pro.

28:52.092 --> 28:54.497
I'd have hosed his ass down,
Sonny Corleone style.

28:54.497 --> 28:55.533
Because I'm
a nervous guy.

28:55.533 --> 28:58.004
You know, I‐I‐I wouldn't
be able to control myself.

28:58.004 --> 29:00.141
Yeah, well, one shot was plenty.

29:00.141 --> 29:03.214
Huh. You know, funny...

29:03.214 --> 29:04.818
we found two bullets

29:04.818 --> 29:06.087
in Tito's skull.

29:08.091 --> 29:09.427
I have a thought.

29:09.427 --> 29:11.130
Hmm?
May I pitch?

29:11.130 --> 29:12.967
Oh, please,
please, please.

29:12.967 --> 29:14.236

29:14.236 --> 29:17.242
showed up after you left
and shot Tito

29:17.242 --> 29:19.581
in the exact same spot
with the exact same

29:19.581 --> 29:21.952
caliber bullet
and then he leaves.

29:21.952 --> 29:23.455
I... maybe‐maybe I shot twice.

29:23.455 --> 29:24.491
I don't, I don't remember.

29:24.491 --> 29:26.294
It happened so fast.

29:26.294 --> 29:27.997
See, I don't
buy that. Right?

29:27.997 --> 29:29.367
If I killed Tito Flores,
I'd have played it

29:29.367 --> 29:30.503
over and over
and over in my head

29:30.503 --> 29:32.039

29:32.039 --> 29:33.409
I killed Tito Flores!

29:33.409 --> 29:35.413
Not a bad name
for your song.

29:35.413 --> 29:36.648
♪ I shot Tito Flores ♪

29:36.648 --> 29:38.285
♪ Shot him in the head ♪

29:38.285 --> 29:39.487
♪ I don't know
how many times ♪

29:39.487 --> 29:40.990
Dead...
♪ But I know
that he's dead. ♪

29:40.990 --> 29:42.159
I got to write this down.
Yeah, I like it.

29:42.159 --> 29:43.127
Well, let's fill out
the paperwork first

29:43.127 --> 29:46.133
and get him released.
That'll be...
Wait.

29:47.370 --> 29:50.476
(sighs)

29:50.476 --> 29:54.451
If I admit I'm innocent, will
you promise not to let me out?

29:57.022 --> 30:01.063
Now, this is a story
that I'd like to hear.

30:01.063 --> 30:04.704
I know Tito's number
two, Raul Mendez.

30:04.704 --> 30:07.142
Sometimes I'd take some cash
from him at the border,

30:07.142 --> 30:08.277
let a truck through.

30:08.277 --> 30:09.948
It was harmless stuff.

30:09.948 --> 30:10.916
When my sister called me

30:10.916 --> 30:12.987
to tell me that Tito's
body was in a trunk

30:12.987 --> 30:14.256
on this side of the border,

30:14.256 --> 30:17.262
I figured I could get
on Raul's good side.

30:17.262 --> 30:19.634
But Raul didn't
want him back.

30:19.634 --> 30:21.671
Raul killed Tito.

30:21.671 --> 30:25.379
And then he went after
my sister and he told me

30:25.379 --> 30:28.184
that if I didn't confess,
he was gonna kill her, too.

30:28.184 --> 30:30.489
MURTAUGH:
So, what, you go to jail

30:30.489 --> 30:33.194
and he pinky swears that he's
not gonna kill your sister?

30:33.194 --> 30:34.597
You're a very trusting man.

30:34.597 --> 30:36.333
I have an insurance policy.

30:36.333 --> 30:38.070
Proof.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.674
Proof that he did it.

30:39.674 --> 30:43.147
I recorded the phone call
with Raul.

30:47.055 --> 30:48.625
MURTAUGH:
So, that's your plan, huh?

30:48.625 --> 30:50.161
You're just gonna
blow up Raul.

30:50.161 --> 30:52.165
Yup.

30:52.165 --> 30:54.437
Since you tossed
my last grenade,

30:54.437 --> 30:57.376
I got to stock up.

30:57.376 --> 30:59.179
Hey, Monty, you got any RPGs?

30:59.179 --> 31:00.248
For you or Murtaugh?

31:00.248 --> 31:01.585
RIGGS:
You honestly think

31:01.585 --> 31:03.020
I'd trust this man
with a rocket launcher?

31:03.020 --> 31:05.124
Third aisle, third shelf,

31:05.124 --> 31:07.062
confiscated from a meth
dealer in Hawthorne.

31:07.062 --> 31:08.331
My man.

31:08.331 --> 31:10.703
So, you're going
down to Mexico

31:10.703 --> 31:12.305
and you're gonna
start a war?

31:12.305 --> 31:13.475
No, I'm gonna finish one.

31:13.475 --> 31:15.211
This is not an RPG.

31:15.211 --> 31:18.084
It's an M‐72.
Monty.

31:18.084 --> 31:20.355
Okay, let's say you go down
there and you're successful

31:20.355 --> 31:21.625
in this little
suicide mission.

31:21.625 --> 31:22.727
You take Raul out.

31:22.727 --> 31:24.597
Someone else is just gonna
step up and take his place.

31:24.597 --> 31:25.733
Then I'll take him out.

31:25.733 --> 31:26.768
You can't because

31:26.768 --> 31:29.106
you just went
on a <i>suicide</i> mission,

31:29.106 --> 31:30.208
or do you not understand

31:30.208 --> 31:32.178
the meaning
of those words?

31:32.178 --> 31:33.381
That's a really good point.

31:33.381 --> 31:34.182
Okay.

31:34.182 --> 31:37.088
Then you'll have
to kill him. Deal?

31:37.088 --> 31:37.890
Pinky swear.

31:37.890 --> 31:39.627
Look, Riggs,
the only way to do this

31:39.627 --> 31:41.631
is to take out
the entire cartel.

31:41.631 --> 31:43.234
Oh, what a great idea.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.104
Why didn't I think of that?
I'm serious.

31:45.104 --> 31:48.645
We take out the whole operation,
but we do it the right way.

31:48.645 --> 31:51.383
And how do you plan
on doing that, Roger?

31:54.122 --> 31:56.360
Well, we're gonna need
a lot more grenades.

32:02.105 --> 32:03.475
All right. You've
got my attention.

32:08.117 --> 32:11.458
(man speaking Spanish)

32:24.617 --> 32:25.819
Oh.

32:25.819 --> 32:28.424
I'm sorry.
Am I late?

32:29.594 --> 32:31.430
I'm late, aren't I?

32:31.430 --> 32:32.466
I knew it.

32:32.466 --> 32:34.604
In fairness, though,

32:34.604 --> 32:37.510
there's, like, 20 churches
in this town, first of all,

32:37.510 --> 32:39.212
so you can see how one can

32:39.212 --> 32:41.518
get turned...
whoa, whoa, whoa,

32:41.518 --> 32:43.220
whoa, guys, look,

32:43.220 --> 32:45.291
let's not lose our heads here.

32:45.291 --> 32:47.696
I mean, unless
you <i>have</i> to shoot,

32:47.696 --> 32:50.636
in which case, then,
we all will.

32:50.636 --> 32:51.805
Lose our heads, that is.

32:51.805 --> 32:52.840
(concerned whispering)

32:52.840 --> 32:55.178
But, hey, at least we're
in the right place, right?

32:55.178 --> 32:58.317
Okay, I'm gonna use
this opportunity, uh,

32:58.317 --> 33:01.491
for all those not involved
in the cartel game

33:01.491 --> 33:03.360
to take their leave.

33:04.831 --> 33:06.366
There we go.

33:10.208 --> 33:14.282
Okay... first, I'd like
to say a few words.

33:16.220 --> 33:17.523
Oh...

33:19.392 --> 33:20.529
To the man,

33:20.529 --> 33:22.398
the murderer,

33:22.398 --> 33:24.236
drug lord‐‐

33:24.236 --> 33:26.875
all‐around human filth.

33:26.875 --> 33:30.248
Yes, Tito Flores killed
a lot of people...

33:30.248 --> 33:32.720
destroyed many families.

33:34.524 --> 33:37.495
Mine included.

33:37.495 --> 33:38.899
I'll never forget you for that.

33:38.899 --> 33:40.769
Truth be told,

33:40.769 --> 33:43.207
I wanted to be the one
that pulled the trigger.

33:43.207 --> 33:46.213
But someone beat me to it.

33:46.213 --> 33:48.517
And that someone
is here today.

33:48.517 --> 33:50.488
Honey, I'd love to talk,
but I can't right now.

33:50.488 --> 33:51.490
Roger,

33:51.490 --> 33:52.760
I got your message.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.764
So you're in Mexico
with Riggs again?

33:54.764 --> 33:57.603
Yes. I am at
Tito Flores's funeral.

33:57.603 --> 34:00.374
And from now on,
no more unilateral decisions.

34:00.374 --> 34:02.278
I'm gonna tell you everything.

34:02.278 --> 34:03.548
(gun cocks)

34:04.584 --> 34:06.621
And in the spirit of sharing,

34:06.621 --> 34:08.290
someone's here
to kill me right now.

34:08.290 --> 34:10.662
I got to go. I love you.
Ro...

34:16.774 --> 34:19.245
Ladies and gentlemen, put your
hands together for Raul!

34:19.245 --> 34:21.851
Come on, Raul,
stand up.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.520
Take a bow.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.626
All right.

34:34.810 --> 34:37.415
My‐My Spanish is a little rusty.

34:37.415 --> 34:40.689
Um, it sounds like
you're denying all this.

34:40.689 --> 34:43.494
Raul, take credit.

34:43.494 --> 34:45.899
Believe me, I would have loved
to have been the one to do it.

34:47.803 --> 34:51.276
Mm...
Maybe I should just
kill you right now.

34:51.276 --> 34:53.380
(whispering):
That's a really good idea.

34:55.686 --> 34:57.856
Why don't you do it
like you did Tito?

34:57.856 --> 34:59.325
Bang‐bang.

34:59.325 --> 35:00.762
Two shots to the head.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.335
(grunting)

35:09.479 --> 35:11.550
Come on, let's go.

35:11.550 --> 35:13.387
Whoo!
Let's do it, Raul!

35:13.387 --> 35:15.257
Together!

35:15.257 --> 35:17.261
(chuckling)

35:17.261 --> 35:18.263
You see these people?

35:18.263 --> 35:21.303
Ah...
They would die for me!

35:21.303 --> 35:24.844
Because I am their <i>patrón.</i>

35:24.844 --> 35:25.846
They will never believe you.

35:25.846 --> 35:28.718
Oh, no, I never expected them
to believe me.

35:28.718 --> 35:29.887
That would be silly.

35:29.887 --> 35:32.625
They can hear it directly
from you.

35:32.625 --> 35:36.500
Hey, Rog, play that tape.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.470
(grunting)

35:48.524 --> 35:51.831
Whenever you're ready, Rog,
go for it, buddy.

35:54.970 --> 35:56.506
(Murtaugh panting)

35:58.310 --> 36:00.614
We seem to be experiencing
some technical difficulties.

36:00.614 --> 36:03.620
Let me summarize what he said
to the border patrol agent.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.759
(imitating Raul):
"You gonna tell everybody

36:05.759 --> 36:07.628
that you're the one
that killed Tito, and..."

36:07.628 --> 36:09.532
RAUL (over speaker): ...and
anyone finds out that it was me,

36:09.532 --> 36:12.471
I'll kill your sister,
and I'll make you watch.

36:12.471 --> 36:13.473
(tape rewinding)

36:13.473 --> 36:15.779
You are going to tell everybody

36:15.779 --> 36:16.848
that you are the one
that killed Tito.

36:16.848 --> 36:19.619
And if anyone finds out...
RIGGS:
See what I mean?

36:19.619 --> 36:21.289
I can never get the tone right.
It sounds so much better

36:21.289 --> 36:22.793
coming from him.

36:22.793 --> 36:25.866
Ooh, it seems as if the
tides have turned, Raul.

36:40.729 --> 36:42.665
Damn.

36:44.469 --> 36:46.039
LAPD cutbacks...

36:51.449 --> 36:52.886
You got to get
me out, man.

36:52.886 --> 36:54.489
I'll talk.
I'll give you names,

36:54.489 --> 36:55.825
shipping routes,
anything you want.

36:55.825 --> 36:58.831
I don't know, sounds like
a lot of paperwork.

37:02.405 --> 37:04.977
Keep me alive, and I will
give you everything you need

37:04.977 --> 37:06.513
to take out the cartel.

37:08.550 --> 37:12.525
You drive a hard bargain,
but all right.

37:23.447 --> 37:24.415
(tires screech)

37:29.994 --> 37:31.463
Coming in!

37:32.966 --> 37:35.905
(engine revs)

37:36.974 --> 37:38.978
(dialing)

37:38.978 --> 37:40.915
(phone chiming)

37:40.915 --> 37:41.984
Roger.

37:41.984 --> 37:45.391
Hey, babe. Yeah,
it's me again.

37:45.391 --> 37:46.559
No, we're fine.
We got our man

37:46.559 --> 37:47.929
and we're heading
back home.

37:50.467 --> 37:51.036
(screaming)

37:53.573 --> 37:54.943
Roger, what was that?

37:54.943 --> 37:57.615
Oh, that's nothing.
We're good.

37:57.615 --> 37:59.719
R‐Riggs just shot off
a rocket launcher.

37:59.719 --> 38:02.425
Okay, baby,

38:02.425 --> 38:03.995
I think that's enough sharing.

38:03.995 --> 38:05.664
So, Raul,

38:05.664 --> 38:08.838
what did it feel like
to kill Tito Flores?

38:13.580 --> 38:17.054
"Erratic.
Unprofessional.

38:17.054 --> 38:18.190
Capricious."

38:18.190 --> 38:20.862
Just a few of the descriptors
the police commission used

38:20.862 --> 38:22.698
in their report.

38:22.698 --> 38:24.001
What about "unhinged"?

38:24.001 --> 38:24.803
"Loose cannons."

38:24.803 --> 38:26.539
We get that one
a lot.
Although,

38:26.539 --> 38:28.176
we did solve the murder.

38:28.176 --> 38:29.847
And Raul's testimony
will take down

38:29.847 --> 38:32.017
most of the cartel's
management structure.

38:32.017 --> 38:34.522
And that with
barely a scratch.

38:34.522 --> 38:35.591
No, you misunderstood.

38:35.591 --> 38:36.994
That was their description
of me.

38:36.994 --> 38:39.031
See, I spent so much time
covering for you two,

38:39.031 --> 38:40.869
they thought <i>I</i> was
the unstable one.

38:40.869 --> 38:43.707
No, you... you idiots‐‐
you get a pass.

38:43.707 --> 38:46.579
The police commission
has officially approved

38:46.579 --> 38:47.849
your reinstatement.

38:53.627 --> 38:55.932
That is, if you want it.

39:03.046 --> 39:06.052
Yeah, well,
I have some expenses.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.788
Who do I send
invoices to?
Oh, no. Hell no.

39:07.788 --> 39:08.958
Yeah, I do.

from a speaker wire,

42:36.872 --> 42:39.778

you even showed up.

I mean, parties are not
really your scene.

43:10.774 --> 43:12.844
Well, Trish invited me,
and I didn't want to be rude.

43:12.844 --> 43:13.846
And that's the only reason?

43:13.846 --> 43:16.485
It's not because you, uh...

43:16.485 --> 43:19.458
Didn't want to drink
alone at home?

43:19.458 --> 43:23.031
No. Because you <i>feel</i> something.

Feel?

43:25.136 --> 43:27.808
I understand, Riggs.

43:27.808 --> 43:29.478
The "L" word scares you.

43:29.478 --> 43:30.980
No, doesn't scare me.

43:30.980 --> 43:32.484
I‐I love guns.

43:32.484 --> 43:34.922
I love my truck.
Ooh...

43:34.922 --> 43:37.059
I love tequila.
Yeah, don't forget,
