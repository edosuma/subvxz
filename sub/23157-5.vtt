WEBVTT

00:02.033 --> 00:05.025
I created the woman
that every man wanted.

00:05.103 --> 00:07.833
Don't you understand?
It's over.

00:08.840 --> 00:11.775
Erin Wolfe blew her head off
with a shotgun last night.

00:11.843 --> 00:15.040
The pellets enter the target
as a single mass...

00:15.113 --> 00:17.741
disintegrating all bone and tissue
and destroying the cranium entirely.

00:17.816 --> 00:19.943
Women don't blow their
heads off with a shotgun.

00:21.453 --> 00:23.921
If you're gonna jump, jump!

01:32.926 --> 01:37.158
I'd give anything to see
the look on your face, Tony.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.427
Well, not quite anything.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.569
Can't have my cake
and eat it too, can I?

01:46.039 --> 01:48.064
Why not?

01:48.141 --> 01:51.633
So, a woman can't go out
like a man, huh?

01:51.711 --> 01:56.648
She takes pills
or swims out to sea...

01:56.716 --> 01:58.946
or slits her wrists,

01:59.019 --> 02:02.045
but she ain't got the guts
to blotto the old face.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.613
Isn't that what you said,
Tony? Huh?

02:06.626 --> 02:11.120
Well, here's one woman who's gonna
take it right between the baby blues...

02:13.233 --> 02:16.725
just to show you
how smart you really are.

02:41.361 --> 02:45.764
Hello? I thought
you were in Tahiti.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.199
No, you can't
come over here tonight.

02:49.269 --> 02:52.102
You can't come over here ever again.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.198
You are to stay away from me, David.

02:55.275 --> 02:58.176
How many times must I tell you?

02:58.245 --> 03:00.577
There is no one else!

03:00.647 --> 03:04.583
Some people can end one relationship
without starting another one.

03:04.651 --> 03:07.085
I know you might find that
a little--

03:08.688 --> 03:11.418
That garbage won't work
with me anymore, David.

03:11.491 --> 03:14.927
I can handle my own career
and my own life.

03:16.263 --> 03:19.255
David, don't you understand?

03:19.332 --> 03:21.266
It's over.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.770
Good-bye, David.

03:26.172 --> 03:29.266
David, good-bye.

04:33.173 --> 04:36.040
He can't control you, Erin.

04:37.477 --> 04:40.742
He can't control you ever again.

04:59.999 --> 05:03.696
I'd give anything to see
the look on your face, David.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.674
David.

05:09.943 --> 05:13.572
Take two.

05:23.289 --> 05:27.385
I'd give anything to see
the look on your face, Tony.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.830
Well, maybe not quite anything.

05:33.900 --> 05:37.734
I can't have my cake
and eat it too, can I?

05:37.804 --> 05:39.499
Why not?

05:39.572 --> 05:42.939
Why can't I have my cake
and eat it too?

05:44.377 --> 05:48.643
It's a stupid expression.
I never did understand it.

05:48.715 --> 05:51.775
Why can't I have my cake
and eat it too?

05:53.319 --> 05:55.651
I don't have to eat it all, do I?

05:58.858 --> 06:00.951
Maybe this once.

06:02.061 --> 06:04.291
Maybe this once I do.

06:09.803 --> 06:13.295
So, a woman can't go out
like a man, huh?

06:14.908 --> 06:19.436
She takes pills
or swims out to sea...

06:20.713 --> 06:22.647
or slits her wrists.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.275
But she ain't got the guts
to blotto the old face.

06:25.351 --> 06:28.616
Isn't that what you said,
David? Huh? Huh?

06:30.657 --> 06:34.957
Well, here's one woman
who's gonna take it...

06:35.028 --> 06:37.496
right between the baby blues...

06:37.564 --> 06:41.557
just to show you
how smart you really are.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.253
Pull.!

07:06.659 --> 07:08.593
Pull.!

07:16.102 --> 07:18.696
Pull!

07:20.206 --> 07:24.404
Higgins! What are you doing?
It's 6:00!

07:24.477 --> 07:27.037
How perceptive of you. Pull!

07:29.349 --> 07:31.442
Higgins, I got in at 4:00.

07:31.518 --> 07:34.453
It is the first time in three days
that I've even seen a bed.

07:34.521 --> 07:37.979
Now, I don't want to deprive you
of the thrill of killing
little clay pigeons,

07:38.057 --> 07:40.184
but do you have to do it
at 6:00 in the morning?

07:42.195 --> 07:46.598
Actually, I prefer
6:00 in the afternoon. Pull!

07:46.666 --> 07:48.998
Six in the after--

07:49.068 --> 07:52.299
I think that's perhaps
your strongest point--

07:52.372 --> 07:55.773
that ability to instantly
comprehend the situation.

07:55.842 --> 07:58.868
Gee, I slept 1 4 straight hours.

07:58.945 --> 08:02.244
See what I mean? Pull!

08:02.315 --> 08:05.045
Gee, I'm sorry--
I'm sorry, Higgins.

08:05.118 --> 08:08.519
I just-- I wouldn't even blame you
if you set the dogs on me.

08:08.588 --> 08:12.490
I would, but, uh,
they're obviously busy.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.493
Pull!

08:18.898 --> 08:22.231
I almost bit.
Pull.!

08:22.302 --> 08:26.238
You know, ask Higgins
if the dogs were out there
releasing those clay pigeons.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.240
Pull.!

08:31.210 --> 08:33.837
But I didn't.

08:40.753 --> 08:44.120
- Here you go, Rick.
- Thanks.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.284
I don't know why I bother.
I know I'm not gonna reach him.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.763
I don't know, Rick.
I got a feeling you'll be talking
to Magnum any minute now.

08:51.831 --> 08:55.733
You got a feeling, huh?
Don't doubt me. We Hawaiians
have a gift for this sort of thing.

08:55.802 --> 09:00.933
We see the future.
I mean, I'd bet you 1 0 bucks.

09:01.007 --> 09:02.907
Don't try and con
a con man, kid.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.570
Where the hell have you been?
I've been trying to reach you all day!

09:05.645 --> 09:07.579
Funny, you don't look
like my mother.

09:07.647 --> 09:10.946
Maybe you better start
thinking of me as your mother.
Give me a beer, Moki.

09:11.017 --> 09:13.679
David Norman's been waiting
for you since 1 0:00.

09:16.022 --> 09:18.957
Oh, you should've sent him home
while he could still crawl.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.391
You know, I said no to him
three weeks ago, Rick.

09:21.461 --> 09:25.056
I may do divorce cases,
but I draw the line at following
live-in friends...

09:25.131 --> 09:27.065
to see who else
they're sleeping with.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.693
You haven't heard?
Heard what?

09:29.769 --> 09:32.636
Erin Wolfe blew her head off
with a shotgun last night.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.996
I just heard, David.
I'm sorry.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.199
Are you?

10:08.274 --> 10:10.208
Nurse!

10:11.411 --> 10:16.348
Uh-oh. He has been hovering
around me all day.

10:16.416 --> 10:20.443
Haven't you, Rick?
Let's see.

10:20.520 --> 10:24.718
I, uh-- I must be
packing them in here, eh?

10:24.791 --> 10:28.921
Now appearing twice nightly
at the King Kamehameha Club,

10:28.995 --> 10:31.327
David Norman
in Pygmalion’s Revenge.

10:31.397 --> 10:34.093
Beautiful Hawaiian sunsets
thrown in, no extra charge.

10:34.167 --> 10:38.763
Mr. Norman, as far as I'm concerned,
you can drink until your liver
does flip-flops.

10:38.838 --> 10:41.033
just don't disturb
the other members, okay?

10:42.875 --> 10:45.105
I'll leave you a lousy tip, Rick.

10:51.250 --> 10:54.014
What are you staring at?

10:59.192 --> 11:01.626
It's not their fault she's dead, David.

11:01.694 --> 11:05.130
- It's not mine.
- I didn't say it was.

11:07.233 --> 11:11.135
- You don't like me, do you?
- Not much.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.615
What did you think of Erin?

11:24.684 --> 11:26.675
I never met her.

11:26.753 --> 11:29.313
She was the same
on-screen as off.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.618
Well, I've never seen
any of her films either.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.716
I'm sure she was a fine actress.

11:33.793 --> 11:37.024
She couldn't act her way out of bed.

11:37.096 --> 11:40.532
Or into it, for that matter.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.068
I'm a pragmatist, Magnum.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.104
Always have been.

11:45.171 --> 11:48.436
A clam could out-act Erin.

11:48.508 --> 11:52.467
But she had the greatest ""T'' and ""A''
the screen has ever seen.

11:52.545 --> 11:56.345
I saw that 1 0 years ago.
Everybody else saw a gawky kid.
I saw the future--

11:56.415 --> 12:01.443
bone structure, the skin, the eyes,
potentially the most beautiful
woman in the world.

12:01.521 --> 12:04.081
So I took her in.

12:04.157 --> 12:07.490
You think beauty is something
that just happens?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.619
Like the sunsets here?
No, no, no, no.

12:09.695 --> 12:13.028
It has to be developed,
nurtured.

12:14.500 --> 12:19.437
So I created the woman
that every man wanted,

12:19.505 --> 12:22.099
and one of them murdered her.

12:22.175 --> 12:25.042
- I thought Erin--
- Hmm? Committed suicide?

12:25.111 --> 12:28.376
No, no, no. Maybe your brah
cops think that, but I know better.

12:28.447 --> 12:30.438
She was murdered.

12:32.552 --> 12:35.953
She was murdered by the man
I wanted you to find.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.957
Do you remember, Magnum?
Do you remember? I begged you.

12:39.025 --> 12:42.893
I begged you to find him.
Yeah, I said she was in trouble,
that she was gonna get hurt.

12:42.962 --> 12:46.523
But no, no, no. You just--
You just weren't interested.

12:46.599 --> 12:51.627
Maybe if you had been,
she'd still be alive today. Hmm?

13:07.086 --> 13:10.522
It's obscene what a load of buckshot
can do to the human face.

13:19.899 --> 13:23.027
Or any part of the anatomy,
for that matter.

13:27.039 --> 13:30.304
Upstairs they're calling this
a suicide. Do you agree?

13:30.376 --> 13:32.310
I don't know.

13:32.378 --> 13:36.041
I'm waiting for
the tox screens and tissue analysis
before I make any decisions.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.242
I take it you don't accept
what they're saying?

13:38.317 --> 13:40.251
No.
Why not?

13:42.255 --> 13:44.553
Women don't blow their heads off
with a shotgun,

13:44.624 --> 13:47.559
especially a beautiful woman
like Erin Wolfe.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.061
They do in the movie
she was gonna make.

13:50.129 --> 13:52.927
It's probably
what gave her the idea.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.524
How long have you been
a medical examiner, Doctor?

13:57.069 --> 14:00.869
In my experience as a medical examiner,
I've never seen a woman,

14:00.940 --> 14:03.408
beautiful or otherwise,
who committed suicide...

14:03.476 --> 14:06.673
by setting off a shotgun blast
in her face.

14:07.914 --> 14:11.975
But I can tell you of a dozen other
strange ways of committing suicide...

14:12.051 --> 14:15.680
that I've seen...
and seen only once.

14:15.755 --> 14:19.384
Maybe Miss Wolfe
just showed me another.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.527
Maybe.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.534
- Yeah?
- Excuse me.

14:29.602 --> 14:33.003
I have a pass here
to view Erin Wolfe's remains.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.071
He's a thumper.

14:37.843 --> 14:41.074
You know, there has to be
some kind of a mistake here.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.081
Erin cannot be dead.
Why not?

14:43.149 --> 14:45.583
Well, she starts
a movie in 1 0 days.

14:45.651 --> 14:50.588
No actress with a megabuck deal
and the lead in Skin Deep
would ever kill herself.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.624
She'd die first.

14:54.226 --> 14:58.219
Have you ever viewed a body
before, Mr. Stein?

14:58.297 --> 15:00.765
What, are you kidding?
I'm an agent.

15:00.833 --> 15:04.394
I've had so many of my clients O.D.,
I could retire on the flower money.

15:04.470 --> 15:08.497
Mr. Stein, a shotgun blast
doesn't make a pretty picture.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.475
She used a shotgun?

15:11.544 --> 15:13.512
I didn't know that.

15:14.680 --> 15:18.207
A shotgun!
just like in the script.

15:18.284 --> 15:21.082
Afraid so.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.851
I told him.

15:25.925 --> 15:30.191
I told that lousy writer
that that scene was sick.

15:30.262 --> 15:33.459
I didn't even enjoy reading it.

15:33.532 --> 15:36.467
No, he insisted we keep it in.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.837
Damn writers!

15:49.015 --> 15:52.883
I can spot a thumper every time.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.556
It's kind of tough
if you're not used to it.

16:02.228 --> 16:06.164
There ain't no way you can ever
get used to anything like that.

16:11.103 --> 16:12.832
No, I guess not.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.837
Thank you.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.776
I still can't believe
it really happened.

16:19.845 --> 16:22.643
Took me six months
to put her deal together.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.377
One of the sweetest
I ever made too.

16:25.451 --> 16:30.912
Now... she's dead.
The deal's dead.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.016
I thought David Norman
handled Erin's career.

16:34.093 --> 16:38.860
Norman? The only thing Norman's
handled in the last 1 0 years
has been a bottle.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.865
He got lucky.

16:40.933 --> 16:44.699
He picked her up as a kid
on a one-night stand and
introduced her to Saul Baxter.

16:46.405 --> 16:49.431
Saul produced
all those jungle movies for her.

16:49.508 --> 16:53.911
That's all she ever would've done
if I hadn't come along--jungle flicks.

16:53.979 --> 16:56.914
The only credit I'll give Norman
is the fact...

16:56.982 --> 16:59.780
that he didn't start her out in X-rated,
like he did all the others.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.377
The others?
Come on, now.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.424
Erin certainly wasn't
his first or his last.

17:05.491 --> 17:09.984
Word around Hollywood is that
he'd already found a new one--

17:10.061 --> 17:14.829
some, uh, island honey he was hot
to promote as the new Erin Wolfe.

17:14.900 --> 17:18.097
While he was living with Erin?
Operative word there is "was. '"

17:18.170 --> 17:21.570
Was living. She kicked him out
about a month ago...

17:21.640 --> 17:26.009
when word she was cast
in Skin Deep leaked to the trades.

17:26.078 --> 17:29.946
Who leaked it?
I did.

17:31.817 --> 17:36.117
I put together the deal of the decade,
and she wanted to keep it under wraps.

17:36.188 --> 17:38.247
I guess she was afraid to tell him.

17:39.458 --> 17:43.656
Look, Magnum,
I know David Norman is paying you
your 500 a day to find whoever--

17:43.729 --> 17:45.959
What's your point, J.J.?

17:46.031 --> 17:49.660
The point is that she was afraid
other ex-lover, your client.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.727
That lecherous leech. She was afraid
he was gonna murder her...

17:52.805 --> 17:55.797
if he ever found out that she
was gonna do a picture without him.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.809
Interesting, huh?

17:57.877 --> 18:01.244
Oh, I figured the odds were 50-50 that
David Norman killed her when I took the case.

18:01.313 --> 18:04.942
- Not bad for a private eye.
- Investigator.

18:05.017 --> 18:08.111
And I didn't say he did it,
just that it wouldn't surprise me.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.121
Who was she seeing?

18:10.189 --> 18:13.420
I just put together the deal.
I didn't check on her bedroom.

18:13.492 --> 18:17.826
I haven't seen Erin
in over a month... till today.

18:17.897 --> 18:20.422
Hey, Suzy, wait a minute.
I'll get a drink with you.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.433
Excuse me.
I need another drink.

18:33.412 --> 18:37.815
Sometimes I get these itches.
Erin Wolfe was one.

18:37.883 --> 18:39.976
Only I didn't know where to scratch.

18:40.052 --> 18:44.284
So I did what every private investigator
manual tells you on page one--

18:44.356 --> 18:47.553
investigate the scene of the crime.

19:08.113 --> 19:12.140
I'd gone months without
remembering 'Nam... until this morning.

19:12.218 --> 19:16.211
The scary part wasn't the memories
that kept popping into my head.

19:16.288 --> 19:20.748
It was the idea that someday
I might flash back in my mind...

19:20.826 --> 19:23.454
and never return.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.693
I may have been the only male
in the English-speaking world...

19:31.770 --> 19:34.762
who hadn't seen
an Erin Wolfe film and fantasized...

19:34.840 --> 19:37.274
about being alone
in the jungle with her.

19:37.343 --> 19:41.473
I'd seen her posters and photos.
She was beautiful.

19:41.547 --> 19:45.244
But I knew half a dozen girls in the Islands
who were just as beautiful.

19:45.317 --> 19:48.081
There had to be more
to Erin's appeal than looks,

19:48.153 --> 19:51.418
and I wanted to know what it was.

20:21.053 --> 20:25.319
The guns were expensive sports models
that I assumed were left by David.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.827
The shotgun was gone, of course.
Police would have it.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.522
The rifles were cleaned
and well-oiled.

20:50.983 --> 20:54.942
But one of the pistols had been fired
and reloaded without cleaning.

20:56.722 --> 20:58.587
I doubted it was an oversight.

20:58.657 --> 21:01.683
You don't own guns like these
and not take care of them,

21:01.760 --> 21:05.560
which meant it probably had
something to do with Erin's death.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.442
There were tapes of everything,
from her films...

21:22.514 --> 21:25.278
to probably every acting class
she'd ever taken.

21:30.422 --> 21:33.050
I decided to give the tapes
a couple of hours...

21:33.125 --> 21:35.423
and started with one ofher films.

21:41.800 --> 21:45.201
It was pretty bad.
No plot. No acting.

21:45.270 --> 21:48.034
just a lot of shots of Erin
taking baths in waterfalls...

21:48.107 --> 21:51.440
and swimming nude
through crocodile-filled waters.

22:00.285 --> 22:02.549
I could hardly sit through
the whole film.

22:09.294 --> 22:11.819
You've got to marry me, Billy!

22:11.897 --> 22:14.866
I "can't."
There ain't no such word
as "can't."

22:14.933 --> 22:17.493
I turned down
Henry Elkins's proposal,

22:17.569 --> 22:19.799
and he's got a good job
at the sawmill...

22:19.872 --> 22:22.636
and a new convertible
and promise.!

22:22.708 --> 22:24.938
Then go marry Henry Elkins!

22:25.010 --> 22:27.274
I can't.
Why not?

22:27.346 --> 22:30.782
'Cause I ain't carryin'
Henry Elkins's baby.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.874
I'm carryin' yours.

22:32.951 --> 22:35.044
Good try, kids.
That was very nice.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.248
First attempt. Really good.
Erin, a little less--

22:38.323 --> 22:42.384
Okay? Don't let it all hang out. Keep it
there, but don't show it quite so much.

22:42.461 --> 22:46.989
John, you're the psychiatrist
and, Erin, you’re an alcoholic. Go.

22:47.065 --> 22:50.501
We're just trying to find out
what-- what this problem is.

22:50.569 --> 22:53.470
My problem is
my husband's leaving me...

22:53.539 --> 22:56.975
and I can't stop drinking,
and he comes home with his boss...

22:57.042 --> 23:00.443
and the house is a mess
'cause I can't get it together.!

23:00.512 --> 23:03.640
It's okay.
 Have you ever thought of hiring a maid?

23:03.715 --> 23:07.310
Who can afford maids?
All my money's going to you.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.844
Well, I'm not really that expensive
if you think about it--

23:10.923 --> 23:13.858
You're expensive if you're
not solving the problem.!

23:13.926 --> 23:17.293
Okay, okay.

23:20.332 --> 23:23.096
- Oh, boy. How was that?
- A little short.

23:23.168 --> 23:25.898
It's coming along.
Now, Erin, you’re the psychiatrist...

23:25.971 --> 23:28.132
and, John, you're a wife beater.

23:33.345 --> 23:36.109
There was something electrifying
about her.

23:36.181 --> 23:39.981
Even when she was just beginning,
there was something special.

23:40.052 --> 23:43.988
She was going to be a star.
No doubt about it.

23:44.056 --> 23:46.786
But we got the guns ashore...

23:46.859 --> 23:50.158
right under the noses
of the very Black and Tan,

23:50.229 --> 23:54.427
all cuddled warm and toasty
in front of their fires,

23:54.500 --> 23:57.162
a hot toddy in their bloody hands,

23:57.236 --> 24:00.672
while Ian froze to the oars...

24:00.739 --> 24:05.369
and Sean smashed against the rock.

24:11.783 --> 24:15.981
She'd worked hard to improve her acting
over the years, and it had paid off.

24:16.054 --> 24:19.455
Erin wasn’t just a beautiful
body anymore. She was good.

24:25.030 --> 24:28.329
Then suddenly I was reminded
that she was also dead.

24:28.400 --> 24:32.234
So, a woman can't go out
like a man, huh?

24:33.772 --> 24:36.639
It was on the end ofher last class tape.

24:36.708 --> 24:38.938
Probably why the police missed it.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.445
In a way, I wish I had too.

24:41.513 --> 24:44.277
The last thing I wanted to see
after this night...

24:44.349 --> 24:46.715
was Erin Wolfe blowing her head off.

24:46.785 --> 24:50.312
Well, here's one woman
who's gonna take it...

24:50.389 --> 24:54.052
right between the baby blues...

24:54.126 --> 24:58.426
just to show you
how smart you really are.

25:03.642 --> 25:06.304
She takes pills...

25:06.370 --> 25:08.361
or swims out to sea...

25:08.439 --> 25:10.532
or slits her wrists.

25:10.608 --> 25:12.633
Shut it off.

25:12.710 --> 25:15.804
Please, shut it off!.

25:15.880 --> 25:19.509
Well, here's one woman
who's gonna take it...

25:19.584 --> 25:23.520
right between the baby blues...

25:23.588 --> 25:28.116
just to show you
how smart you really are.

25:35.032 --> 25:38.195
The shotgun isn't loaded, David.

25:42.373 --> 25:44.398
She didn't even blink.

25:47.144 --> 25:49.840
Where'd you get that? Police?

25:54.251 --> 25:56.185
No. I found it here.

25:56.253 --> 25:58.744
You know, there was another
rehearsal before this one,

25:58.823 --> 26:01.291
but she was interrupted
by a phone call, David.
From whom?

26:05.229 --> 26:06.560
The police?

26:08.733 --> 26:11.463
You can't give 'em
that tape, Magnum.
Why not?

26:11.535 --> 26:15.130
It proves Erin didn't commit suicide.
Isn't that why you hired me?
To prove she was murdered?

26:15.206 --> 26:18.107
I hired you to find her lover.
He killed her.

26:18.175 --> 26:21.110
The cops would never
understand about my call.
They'd think I did it.

26:21.178 --> 26:24.579
Did you?
Magnum, I swear to God...

26:24.649 --> 26:26.674
I did not kill Erin Wolfe.

26:26.751 --> 26:29.652
Then why didn't you tell me
you were in love with someone else?

26:31.389 --> 26:34.984
What? Who told you that?

26:35.059 --> 26:38.495
-J.J.
- The lying leech!

26:40.064 --> 26:44.626
That's the kind of bull he used to feed
into Erin's head to get her as a client.

26:44.702 --> 26:46.602
He told her she could act.

26:46.671 --> 26:48.605
She can.

26:48.673 --> 26:51.836
You know, if you were
in love with someone else,

26:51.909 --> 26:53.900
maybe you just wanted
to get rid of Erin,

26:53.978 --> 26:56.572
maybe even replace her
on the screen.

26:56.647 --> 27:00.549
Magnum, you are insane.

27:00.618 --> 27:04.577
Ginger is simply a body I sleep with.

27:04.655 --> 27:06.850
Nothing more.

27:06.924 --> 27:10.792
Oh, sure, I promised her
a career in the movies.

27:10.861 --> 27:13.193
In this business, who doesn't?

27:14.265 --> 27:16.199
I loved Erin.

27:19.270 --> 27:23.798
She ran out,
not the other way around.

27:23.874 --> 27:26.001
I mean, you heard the phone call.

27:26.077 --> 27:28.204
No, I didn't.

27:28.279 --> 27:32.147
She stopped the tape
before she picked up the phone.

27:45.763 --> 27:48.129
The house isn't that big.

27:49.567 --> 27:52.536
Well, did you run the tests?

27:52.603 --> 27:55.800
Oh, come on, Higgins!
I told you over the phone.

27:55.873 --> 27:59.400
I want to hear it in person,
Magnum, face-to-face,

27:59.477 --> 28:01.911
so there are no misunderstandings.

28:01.979 --> 28:04.470
I will bring no visitors, hold no parties,

28:04.548 --> 28:08.348
use none of the recreational facilities
nor make my presence known...

28:08.419 --> 28:11.980
to any of Robin's guests
for a period of one week.

28:12.056 --> 28:13.489
Two.

28:13.557 --> 28:15.752
Two?

28:15.826 --> 28:17.259
Two.

28:30.908 --> 28:34.309
David Norman?

28:34.378 --> 28:38.439
I say, this is a great pleasure.
Magnum didn't tell me you were involved.

28:38.516 --> 28:42.680
I've been a fan of yours since your
first film. Khyber Pass, wasn't it?

28:42.753 --> 28:45.779
Bloody good show.

28:48.359 --> 28:51.385
- He's not from 5-0.
- I never said he was.

28:51.462 --> 28:55.091
Higgins was just running
some ballistics tests for me.

28:55.166 --> 28:57.464
And I would love to know
the results, Higgins.

28:57.535 --> 28:59.628
Actually, the tests
weren't really necessary.

28:59.703 --> 29:02.797
One can compute the results
from standard ballistic tables.

29:02.873 --> 29:05.034
However, some of us
require visual aids.

29:05.109 --> 29:07.543
just get on with it, Higgins.

29:09.580 --> 29:14.847
This... is a 1 2-gauge
double-ought shotgun shell.

29:14.919 --> 29:18.320
It contains 1 2 30-caliber pellets.

29:20.057 --> 29:22.958
Or buckshot,
as I believe you Yanks call it.

29:23.027 --> 29:25.860
As you requested,
on the first test shot,

29:27.331 --> 29:31.791
fired precisely at four feet
with a full choke and bore.

29:31.869 --> 29:34.463
Now, as you can see,
at this distance,

29:34.538 --> 29:37.996
the pellets enter the target
as a single mass,

29:38.075 --> 29:40.407
approximately
five centimeters in width.

29:40.477 --> 29:43.310
This would put a rather nasty hole
in one's head...

29:43.380 --> 29:45.405
but leave some
of the cranium intact.

29:45.482 --> 29:49.816
Uh, could I have a drink?
Scotch and water will do nicely.
And, uh, no ice, please.

29:51.422 --> 29:56.519
Test shot number two, fired from
1 2 feet with the same choke and bore.

29:58.329 --> 30:02.663
At this distance, the pellets are spread
to over 25 centimeters in width.

30:02.733 --> 30:07.227
They no longer penetrate as a single
mass but as 1 2 individual missiles,

30:07.304 --> 30:10.740
disintegrating all bone and tissue
and destroying the cranium entirely.

30:12.009 --> 30:14.341
In other words, gentlemen,

30:14.411 --> 30:17.710
at 1 2 feet, double-ought
blows one's bloody head off.

30:17.781 --> 30:19.578
Cheers.

30:20.918 --> 30:23.944
Of course, the further you are
from the target, the wider the pattern.

30:24.021 --> 30:27.388
At some point, the dispersal
becomes so wide, it's no longer lethal--

30:27.458 --> 30:29.449
usually 60 or 7 0 meters.
Higgins--

30:29.526 --> 30:34.395
Although I personally have seen loads
kill up to 1 50 meters, catch an eye--
Higgins!

30:34.465 --> 30:37.366
I remember once on a night patrol
in North Africa--

30:37.434 --> 30:40.403
we were running out of water and
we had to pinch it from a Jerry well.

30:40.471 --> 30:42.530
Shut up.

30:45.676 --> 30:48.406
just get him to shut up.

30:48.479 --> 30:50.674
Higgins, please.

30:54.652 --> 30:58.554
See, the police found the shotgun
tied to the chair here,

30:58.622 --> 31:01.113
1 2 feet away from the sofa
where Erin was found dead.

31:01.191 --> 31:06.390
The young actress
who committed suicide?
It happened here?

31:06.463 --> 31:09.296
Yeah, it happened here,
only it wasn't a suicide.

31:09.366 --> 31:12.426
See, the tape shows that
she put the shotgun here,

31:12.503 --> 31:15.131
four feet away,
to rehearse a scene.

31:15.205 --> 31:18.140
Now, why move it back
eight feet to commit suicide?

31:18.208 --> 31:20.870
No, Erin was murdered.

31:20.945 --> 31:23.277
But whoever did it...

31:23.347 --> 31:25.872
must've had to have her
just sit there...

31:25.950 --> 31:29.681
while he moved the shotgun back
and pulled the trigger.

31:29.753 --> 31:33.587
Why-- I don't know.

31:38.696 --> 31:43.633
What is it?
Nothing.

31:43.701 --> 31:46.829
Oh, don't give me nothing! Your eyes
just popped right outta your head.

31:49.006 --> 31:53.102
- You didn't take that picture?
- No.

31:54.945 --> 31:57.072
Wonder who did.

31:57.281 --> 31:59.112
You recognize the cove?

31:59.183 --> 32:01.151
Ow!

32:01.218 --> 32:04.381
Boy, that sure was
a good-lookin' woman.

32:04.455 --> 32:07.549
You recognize the cove, T.C.?
It's gotta be on one of the islands.

32:07.624 --> 32:10.525
Oh, yeah, that looks like
one of those coves around--

32:10.594 --> 32:12.789
Uh, don't touch that.
You'll get grease on it.

32:12.863 --> 32:16.799
Yeah. Anyway, looks like
one of those coves around Moloka'i
along the Paui Coast.

32:16.867 --> 32:19.267
Yeah, you're right.
I'll bet that's where it is.

32:19.336 --> 32:23.534
Or it might be
one of the coves on Koolaus,

32:23.607 --> 32:25.541
right here on Oahu.

32:25.609 --> 32:29.409
The beaches on the Koolaus
are wider than this, a lot wider.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.608
Yeah, you're right.
So it can't be on the Koolaus.

32:32.683 --> 32:36.278
It also eliminates West Maui.

32:36.353 --> 32:40.949
But, you know, I know of
some coves around East Maui,

32:41.025 --> 32:44.961
and I also know of a couple
around the Big Island.

32:45.029 --> 32:50.194
You know, there's also some coves
around the smaller islands along Kauai--

32:50.267 --> 32:54.704
T.C., what you're telling me is you
don't know where this picture was taken.

32:54.772 --> 32:56.865
Uh, no, not really.

32:56.940 --> 32:59.909
Thanks a lot.

32:59.977 --> 33:05.005
Hey, Thomas. Hey, buddy,
it's that important?

33:05.082 --> 33:09.314
No. I just came out here because I like
to see helicopters take off and land.

33:09.386 --> 33:12.287
All right.
If it's that important,

33:12.356 --> 33:14.824
why don't you ask John
over there at Paradise Found?

33:14.892 --> 33:17.122
john?
Yeah.

33:17.194 --> 33:19.594
That's his camping equipment
there in the background.

33:19.663 --> 33:22.598
He knows where that cove is.

33:22.666 --> 33:25.226
Thank you very much.

33:27.304 --> 33:29.795
She was twice as beautiful
in the flesh.

33:29.873 --> 33:32.068
I still can't believe she's dead.

33:32.142 --> 33:34.736
Is this your camping equipment?

33:34.812 --> 33:37.872
Yeah, that's our gear.
All you need is desire.

33:37.948 --> 33:41.179
We supply the rest--
food, equipment, isolation.

33:41.251 --> 33:43.242
We got spots on all the Islands,

33:43.320 --> 33:45.618
wherever a chopper
or a boat can get into.

33:45.689 --> 33:47.623
Paradise Found.

33:47.691 --> 33:49.625
Well, where is this paradise?

33:49.693 --> 33:51.661
West side of Kapua.

33:51.728 --> 33:54.993
It's a small, unpopulated island
north of Kauai.

33:55.065 --> 33:59.798
We cut a landing pad in the jungle
on top of the mountain and a trail
from there to the cove below.

33:59.870 --> 34:01.804
She go there often?

34:01.872 --> 34:04.363
Almost every weekend lately,
maybe more.

34:04.441 --> 34:06.705
She said sometimes
she went by boat.

34:06.777 --> 34:09.268
It was the only place she
could get away from the press.

34:09.346 --> 34:11.940
Who went with her?
Nobody I know of.

34:12.014 --> 34:14.141
Except the first time,
about a year ago.

34:14.217 --> 34:17.016
Then her old man
David Norman went along.

34:17.087 --> 34:19.146
That's why he wanted
to go back there today.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.657
He said the weekend
they spent--
Hey, wait a minute!

34:21.725 --> 34:23.851
David Norman
went out there today?

34:23.927 --> 34:26.589
Yeah. Billy took him
a half hour ago.

34:26.663 --> 34:29.097
Take care.
Yeah, John.

34:34.438 --> 34:36.871
Never saw the photo.!
He took it.!

34:36.940 --> 34:40.842
He tried to hire me a month ago because
she'd been slipping away on weekends.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.708
So what does dummy here do?
I see him looking at the photo,

34:43.780 --> 34:46.543
see the light bulb go off in his head,
and I still buy the lies!

34:46.617 --> 34:49.949
If her lover killed her, he still
may be hiding out on that island.

34:50.020 --> 34:53.148
Or if he didn't kill her, he still
may be there waiting for her to show up.

34:53.223 --> 34:55.157
Or he may not be there at all.

34:55.225 --> 34:59.992
David Norman could find some poor guy
from Dubuque, Iowa getting a sunburn
and think he's Erin's lover.

35:00.063 --> 35:03.396
Or he may think it's your friend Billy,
who's flying him--

35:03.467 --> 35:05.628
What's wrong?

35:06.837 --> 35:09.237
I don't know.
Oil pressure's dropping.

35:09.306 --> 35:12.469
I replaced some leaky seals
earlier, but I don't know.

35:12.543 --> 35:16.035
Well, you wouldn't go up if there
was anything really wrong, right?

35:16.113 --> 35:19.412
Well, Thomas, you gotta test
these things in the air sometime.

35:22.319 --> 35:24.549
T.C. was doing this on purpose.

35:24.621 --> 35:26.748
There wasn't anything wrong
with the chopper.

35:26.823 --> 35:28.723
He just wanted
to get a rise out of me.

35:28.792 --> 35:30.726
Well, I wasn't going to bite.

35:30.794 --> 35:32.887
Damn!
What?

35:32.963 --> 35:35.523
I'm gettin' grease
all over my upholstery.

35:42.272 --> 35:46.265
Paradise Found, Paradise Found, this is
Island Hoppers. Do you read me?

35:46.343 --> 35:49.073
- Billy, do you read me? Over.
- Ten-four.

35:49.146 --> 35:51.444
What you doin'in my turf, T.C.?
Cuttin'in on my business?

35:51.515 --> 35:55.451
Business? You call that gigolo
service of yours a business?

35:55.519 --> 35:58.215
T.C.
Don't you talk
about Paradise that way.

35:58.288 --> 36:02.247
I'll take this little chopper and run
rings around that flying paint can of yours.

36:02.326 --> 36:07.263
With what? That rubber band-driven
collection of spare parts you call a chopper?

36:07.331 --> 36:09.356
T.C..!

36:09.433 --> 36:13.130
- I've seen Frisbees hover longer.
- T.C., ask him about David Norman!

36:13.203 --> 36:17.867
Oh, yeah. Eh, Billy, did you fly
a ahole by the name of David Norman...

36:17.941 --> 36:20.136
to that pad of yours on Kapua?

36:20.210 --> 36:23.646
Big 1 0-4. Hey, how'd you
know who I flew over there?

36:23.714 --> 36:26.148
Billy, this is McGarrett of 5-0.
Was David Norman armed?

36:26.216 --> 36:31.347
No, he just had a backpack and an orchid
lei he wanted to leave in Erin's memory.

36:41.565 --> 36:44.398
Somebody's camping on the beach.

36:44.468 --> 36:47.801
Oil pressure's dropping, man.
I gotta put down fast.

36:47.871 --> 36:51.136
Well, why not right down there?
It's too small.

36:51.208 --> 36:55.508
The only chance we've got
is Billy's pad on top of the mountain.
I gotta warn who's ever down there.

36:55.579 --> 37:00.778
Well, if you're gonna jump, jump.
I got less than 50 seconds
before my fan seizes up.

37:19.903 --> 37:23.930
Come on, mama. Just hang in there
just a few more seconds.

37:41.892 --> 37:43.951
We're gonna make it!

37:54.971 --> 37:56.734
Catch, damn it! Catch!

38:07.284 --> 38:10.253
Hello? Anybody here?

38:16.159 --> 38:18.150
Hello!

38:18.228 --> 38:20.856
Anybody here?

38:20.931 --> 38:23.399
Unfortunately.

38:36.698 --> 38:40.134
I don't believe you guys.!
jumping out of helicopters.!

38:40.201 --> 38:43.364
How'd you find me, anyway?
No one knew I was here.

38:43.438 --> 38:46.737
- You're alive.
- I sure hope I am.

38:47.809 --> 38:51.142
- Look, Mister--
- Magnum. Thomas Magnum.

38:51.212 --> 38:54.238
Okay, listen, Mr. Thomas Magnum.

38:54.315 --> 38:57.773
I don't know who you're a stringer for
and I really don't care.

38:57.852 --> 39:00.878
But this is my last weekend
here on the Islands for a long time,

39:00.955 --> 39:03.321
- and I'd like to enjoy it alone.
- Erin! Erin!

39:03.391 --> 39:05.791
We're gonna get in your boat
and get out of here right now.

39:05.860 --> 39:10.559
- I think you better leave.
- I'm not here to harm you.

39:10.632 --> 39:15.262
That's what all reporters say,
and none mean it.
If you are a reporter--

39:15.336 --> 39:19.329
I'm a private investigator,
and I don't have time to explain.

39:19.407 --> 39:23.571
Did a Paradise Found chopper
fly over here a little while ago?

39:23.645 --> 39:25.442
Yep.

39:25.513 --> 39:29.244
Well, it dropped David here.
What?

39:29.317 --> 39:32.616
I think he's come here to kill you.
Look, I don't have time to explain.

39:32.687 --> 39:34.917
just swim out to the boat with me
and I will.

39:36.824 --> 39:40.123
Erin, look, if I was gonna harm you,

39:40.194 --> 39:42.788
I-I could do it here
just as easily as on the boat.

39:42.864 --> 39:45.196
just please trust me.

39:50.238 --> 39:52.536
No! Stay back!

39:57.912 --> 40:00.403
Keep going.

40:15.063 --> 40:17.554
You're bleeding.

40:17.632 --> 40:22.194
Magnum, do you hear me?

40:22.270 --> 40:25.728
Who was that woman
at your place Friday night?

40:25.807 --> 40:29.038
Ginger.
Ginger? David's new girl?

40:29.110 --> 40:32.170
How'd you know
anybody was at my place?

40:32.246 --> 40:34.976
How long have you been following me?
Why would she come to see--

40:35.049 --> 40:38.246
No, no, don't do that. I got it.
You just watch out for David.

40:38.319 --> 40:40.583
She's young.

40:40.655 --> 40:44.682
She wanted one of those young, naive
ex-girlfriend/new girlfriend talks.

40:44.759 --> 40:46.693
What did you tell her?

40:46.761 --> 40:51.198
To leave him while she could,
before she wasted 1 0 years like me.

40:51.265 --> 40:53.563
You're not answering my questions.

40:53.634 --> 40:56.603
I will in a minute.
Was Ginger still there when you left?

40:56.671 --> 41:00.266
Yes. She was pretty high
when she got there,

41:00.341 --> 41:03.572
and she drank almost a whole bottle
of wine while she was there.

41:03.644 --> 41:08.206
She got sick. I told her to use
the bedroom till she felt better.

41:08.282 --> 41:11.080
The place will be hers soon anyway.
Can you walk?

41:11.152 --> 41:13.882
Yeah, yeah, I can. In a minute.

41:13.955 --> 41:16.082
I bet you Ginger looks
a lot like you, right?

41:16.157 --> 41:18.091
Same hair, same height,
same build.

41:18.159 --> 41:21.151
All David's women look alike.
Now, will you please tell me
what's going on?

41:21.229 --> 41:25.290
I think David let himself in,
took a pistol from the gun cabinet,

41:25.366 --> 41:28.301
and in the dark
shot Ginger in the head.

41:31.939 --> 41:35.136
He probably intended to make it
look like a suicide all along.

41:35.209 --> 41:37.700
But with Ginger,
see, he couldn't do that,

41:37.779 --> 41:41.476
so he put her in your clothes
and put her body on the sofa.

41:41.549 --> 41:44.450
The shotgun.
Yeah. Erin,

41:44.519 --> 41:47.044
the whole world thinks you're dead.

41:47.121 --> 41:49.055
David hired me to find your lover.

41:49.123 --> 41:51.114
I don't have a lover!

41:51.192 --> 41:56.095
David believes you do because
of all the weekends you disappeared.

41:56.164 --> 41:59.565
I was here, alone!
David didn't know that.

41:59.634 --> 42:02.626
He figured wherever your lover was,
that's where you'd be.

42:02.703 --> 42:04.637
That's why he hired me
to find your lover.

42:04.705 --> 42:10.075
Once I led him to your lover,
then he'd kill all three of us.

42:10.144 --> 42:13.136
Look, he can still kill
the two of us.

42:13.214 --> 42:17.014
Don't give up on us yet.
T.C. will have made a call.

42:17.084 --> 42:20.576
He had to make an emergency call.

42:20.655 --> 42:25.957
Kauai Center,
this is Bravo fiver-one-six.

42:26.027 --> 42:28.655
I need emergency assistance. Over.

42:34.335 --> 42:38.294
Anyone this frequency,
this is Bravo fiver-one-six.

42:38.372 --> 42:41.933
I have made an emergency
landing on Kapua.

42:42.009 --> 42:45.501
I need assistance.
Do you read me? Over.

43:14.141 --> 43:16.735
Rick!

43:16.811 --> 43:20.178
Who?
T.C. fired that flare.

43:20.248 --> 43:24.582
Come on. Charlie'll
be tracking us by now.

44:16.170 --> 44:20.004
You can follow this stream
to the beach.

44:20.074 --> 44:23.066
Swim out to the boat
and get the hell out of here.

44:23.144 --> 44:25.203
What about you?

44:25.279 --> 44:29.477
Erin, look, I make
a pretty tough target... alone.

44:29.550 --> 44:34.078
But you don't even have a gun.
T.C. does. I'll get to him.

44:34.155 --> 44:38.114
But you don't even know me.
Why are you risking your life?

44:38.192 --> 44:40.752
I know you better than you think.

44:40.828 --> 44:45.094
I spent last night with you--
on tape, anyway.

44:45.166 --> 44:49.398
In fact, this kind of reminds me
of Queen of Borneo.

44:49.470 --> 44:53.600
I think that was the title.
Oh, unfortunately.

44:53.674 --> 44:56.609
It wasn't that bad. Honest.

44:56.677 --> 45:01.080
It was awful.
They were all awful.

45:01.148 --> 45:04.174
But at least they had
happy endings.

45:10.558 --> 45:14.119
Uh, Erin, play dead.
Don't say anything.

45:14.195 --> 45:19.030
You're not gonna die, Rick.
Hear me? You're not gonna die.

45:48.462 --> 45:52.694
She's dead, David.
You killed her!

45:52.767 --> 45:54.894
I didn't kill her.! You did.!
Stay still.

45:54.969 --> 45:58.097
- If you'd found her lover,
none of this would've happened.
- She had no lover!

45:58.172 --> 46:03.701
She was alone all those weekends.
She was here alone, to think.

46:03.778 --> 46:07.680
Think? Think? She couldn't think.
She was a body.

46:07.748 --> 46:10.148
No, he's here somewhere!

46:10.217 --> 46:13.778
I'll find him...
once I take care of you.

46:15.589 --> 46:20.151
You may as well come out.
Be quicker that way.

46:21.629 --> 46:24.655
Don't say anything.
just stay there.
Uh-huh.

46:24.732 --> 46:29.362
Clean kill. I promise.

46:43.484 --> 46:46.282
If I have to come in after you, Magnum,

46:46.353 --> 46:49.584
I swear to God I'll gut-shoot you
and leave you for the rats.

47:02.303 --> 47:05.204
I wouldn't do that, boy.

47:06.807 --> 47:10.573
Uh, T.C., help.

47:10.644 --> 47:13.477
Help? You sure do need help.

47:13.547 --> 47:17.142
Man, they're whipping your behind.
My behind? We're a team.

47:17.218 --> 47:19.482
Huh! We are a gaggle.

47:19.553 --> 47:23.250
- Two can't be a gaggle.
- They can if one of them is you.

47:23.324 --> 47:26.054
We'll come back.
Here we go.

47:26.127 --> 47:28.061
I got it.

47:28.129 --> 47:31.189
Now, I love two-man volleyball,
but I wasn't at my peak.

47:31.265 --> 47:34.132
A month was hardly enough time
for my wound to heal.

47:34.201 --> 47:36.692
But, then, I didn't want
to use it as an excuse.

47:36.771 --> 47:38.796
Geez, my leg must not be healed.

47:38.873 --> 47:40.864
Uh-huh.

47:42.309 --> 47:45.301
- Thanks, guys.
- Anytime, Magnum.

47:47.081 --> 47:50.107
Erin called last night.

47:50.184 --> 47:52.584
Oh, yeah? How is she?
Oh, she's terrific.

47:52.653 --> 47:55.486
The doctor said she could
start the film next week.

47:55.556 --> 47:58.252
Her body must have been
in great shape.

48:01.462 --> 48:03.521
Hey, T.C.

48:03.597 --> 48:05.690
Yo.

48:05.766 --> 48:08.701
You ever think about 'Nam?

48:08.769 --> 48:12.535
I mean, have memories
flash through your head
without really thinking about it?

48:24.451 --> 48:26.476
No. Never.

48:27.521 --> 48:29.955
Oh. That's kinda what I thought.

48:31.225 --> 48:34.786
How about you?
Who, me? No.
