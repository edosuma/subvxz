WEBVTT

00:01.666 --> 00:02.833
No, no, no!

00:02.900 --> 00:04.966
Don't touch that dial.

00:05.033 --> 00:08.233
Here's what's
on my mind tonight.

00:09.866 --> 00:11.633
Tabloid reporter on assignment.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.000
Where am I going?

00:13.066 --> 00:14.366
Little place called Springwood.

00:14.433 --> 00:16.600
An editor on the warpath.

00:16.666 --> 00:19.366
I expect a new story
faxed and on my desk

00:19.433 --> 00:20.866
'first thing tomorrow morning.'

00:20.933 --> 00:23.166
And an eminent deadline.

00:23.233 --> 00:26.700
Wonder how far
that reporter's willing to go.

00:26.766 --> 00:30.100
Faceless man murders
hotel guest.

00:30.166 --> 00:34.900
Gloria Loring stars on
the next "Freddy's Nightmares."

00:55.300 --> 00:57.700
You're in Springwood now.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.866
And you're all mine.

01:46.166 --> 01:47.766
I just came to say goodbye

01:47.833 --> 01:48.833
Okay.

01:49.800 --> 01:50.800
Shoot.

01:52.033 --> 01:53.233
Well..

01:53.300 --> 01:55.300
- What?
- Say goodbye.

01:56.266 --> 01:57.766
That's very funny, Dittano

01:57.833 --> 01:59.800
Roger.
Call me Roger.

01:59.866 --> 02:01.200
I mean, you don't mind
if I call you Ellen

02:01.266 --> 02:02.933
now that I no longer
work for you?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.433
Here, Ellen, have a jawbreaker.

02:06.533 --> 02:08.300
No, thanks.

02:08.366 --> 02:11.066
- Listen, Dittano.
- Roger.

02:11.133 --> 02:12.566
Whatever.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.766
Is there any way I can change
your mind about leaving?

02:14.833 --> 02:16.833
Not a chance.

02:18.266 --> 02:19.766
Then I wanna get
one more story out of you.

02:19.833 --> 02:22.433
Unh-unh. I'm out of here.
I am history.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.433
I'm no longer writing this..

02:24.500 --> 02:26.033
...doo-doo.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.500
'This time next week,
I'll be working'

02:27.566 --> 02:29.866
for the "Chicago Tribune."

02:29.933 --> 02:31.966
A real paper.

02:32.033 --> 02:34.966
You're paid till the end
of the week. You're still mine.

02:36.800 --> 02:40.166
Okay, Ellen, shoot.

02:40.233 --> 02:42.400
What's the fairytale this time?

02:42.466 --> 02:45.333
"World Inquirer"
reporter commits suicide.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.733
Ah! You gotta be
out of your mind.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.266
Circulation should double
with this picture on the cover.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.700
'Help me.'

02:56.766 --> 02:59.400
Dittano,
no sleeping on my time.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.366
Dittano!

03:01.433 --> 03:03.933
I pay you to work,
not to sleep.

03:05.233 --> 03:07.233
Ah.
I don't want to sleep.

03:07.300 --> 03:09.100
I have to sleep.

03:09.166 --> 03:11.100
I do my best work
when I'm asleep.

03:12.666 --> 03:14.766
Is that when you come up
with your bad grammar?

03:14.833 --> 03:16.966
I had to fix it again
on the Bigfoot story.

03:17.033 --> 03:18.966
Well, an editor's work
is never done.

03:19.033 --> 03:22.400
Mm. "A real Bigfoot joined
Michael Jackson's menageri

03:22.466 --> 03:23.800
after he saved his life."

03:23.866 --> 03:25.700
Who saved whose life?

03:25.766 --> 03:27.800
Michael saved Bigfoot,
of course.

03:27.866 --> 03:29.800
Will you check
your pronouns next time?

03:29.866 --> 03:30.833
Yeah. Yeah.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.833
Uh, what is next time?

03:32.900 --> 03:34.600
I believe going out of town.

03:34.666 --> 03:36.533
Oh, great.
Where am I going?

03:36.600 --> 03:38.633
Little place called Springwood.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.600
Oh, and what's in Springwood?

03:40.666 --> 03:41.700
Elvis.

03:41.766 --> 03:44.100
Presley?

03:44.166 --> 03:46.600
Well, they have several
reportings of-of sightings

03:46.666 --> 03:48.833
at a hotel there,
where he supposedly lives.

03:50.366 --> 03:52.233
Yeah.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.266
You leave in an hour.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.533
Ugh!

03:54.600 --> 03:57.166
At least can I fly
an airlines I recognize?

04:06.266 --> 04:08.933
"Man explodes.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.933
"Aliens torture woman to death.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.033
"Bigfoot.."

04:14.100 --> 04:17.500
I love it. I love this paper!

04:17.566 --> 04:20.600
Not afraid to lie.
No ethics.

04:20.666 --> 04:23.033
Not afraid to
step over the line.

04:25.700 --> 04:29.033
Wonder how far that
reporter's willing to go?

04:30.933 --> 04:34.800
Maybe I'll, uh,
just give him a little test.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.200
Excuse me.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.766
Excuse me.

04:47.833 --> 04:49.833
Roger Dittano.
"World Inquirer."

04:51.266 --> 04:55.500
Um, I had a call earlier about
a claim that, uh, Elvis Presley

04:55.566 --> 04:57.500
was living in this hotel.

04:57.566 --> 04:58.766
So?

04:58.833 --> 04:59.933
Is he here?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.766
No. Left this mornin'.

05:02.833 --> 05:07.233
Said he was gonna do a concert
with John, uh, Lennon.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.633
'He'll be back
in couple of days.'

05:09.700 --> 05:11.000
After he does his concert?

05:11.066 --> 05:12.766
That's right.

05:12.833 --> 05:14.866
Of course.

05:14.933 --> 05:16.233
Got a phone?

05:22.700 --> 05:25.400
He's on tour with John Lennon.

05:28.933 --> 05:31.733
- It's very funny, Dittano.
- 'I'm not trying to be funny.'

05:31.800 --> 05:33.366
'That's what the guy
behind the desk said.'

05:33.433 --> 05:36.633
So I figured I'd-I'd still
try to make it to Chicago

05:36.700 --> 05:38.333
for my interview
with "The Tribune."

05:38.400 --> 05:40.933
Wrong. Get a room,
and wait till Elvis comes back.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.833
And use the time to pull up
another story.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.166
Well, I've got to get
to my interview by--

05:44.233 --> 05:47.033
I expect a new story
faxed and on my desk

05:47.100 --> 05:49.033
first thing tomorrow morning.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.200
'Room service.'

06:03.900 --> 06:05.766
Hi.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.300
Here's your order, sir.

06:07.366 --> 06:09.000
There's, uh,
chocolate cake

06:09.066 --> 06:11.800
cheesecake, cookies

06:11.866 --> 06:14.033
and two pots of coffee.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.133
Do you know you're pregnant?

06:15.200 --> 06:16.633
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Oh, well, geez.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.333
You shouldn't be carrying
a heavy tray. Here. Have a seat.

06:21.833 --> 06:23.100
Uh..

06:23.166 --> 06:25.400
If you don't mind
my asking, sir.

06:25.466 --> 06:28.033
You gonna eat
all that by yourself?

06:28.100 --> 06:29.100
'Oh, afraid so.'

06:29.166 --> 06:31.033
I have trouble staying awake, uh

06:31.100 --> 06:33.533
during a deadline, so
the caffeine and the sugar help.

06:34.900 --> 06:35.966
Yeah, I know, that's how

06:36.033 --> 06:37.600
generally how I feel
after I eat this stuff.

06:37.666 --> 06:39.900
No, I think
the baby's comin'.

06:39.966 --> 06:42.033
Oh, my God. Sit down.

06:42.100 --> 06:45.700
Oh, ah, here. Let me get you
a nice, hot cup of coffee.

06:45.766 --> 06:47.133
Oh, that's stupid.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.700
Here, a glass of water.

06:50.833 --> 06:52.200
Take it, drink.

06:54.733 --> 06:56.033
Front desk? Yeah.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.066
If you don't get a cab up here
in the next five minutes

06:58.133 --> 07:00.100
this woman is gonna squeeze out
a brand-new person

07:00.166 --> 07:02.366
right in the middle of room 23.

07:06.633 --> 07:08.866
'I-I don't think your cabin
is prepared to deal with that.'

07:08.933 --> 07:10.900
Right. Room 23.

07:11.900 --> 07:12.966
You okay?

07:13.033 --> 07:14.000
Is there anything
that I can do for you

07:14.066 --> 07:15.200
while we wait for the cab?

07:15.266 --> 07:17.100
Uh, pour some water?

07:17.166 --> 07:18.800
Oh, uh, take in a breathe.

07:21.633 --> 07:23.600
You married?

07:23.666 --> 07:24.866
No.

07:24.933 --> 07:26.733
Well, it'd be mighty nice
if you ride with me

07:26.800 --> 07:28.133
to the hospital.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.966
Oh, do you want me
to call your husband?

07:30.033 --> 07:31.666
No husband.

07:31.733 --> 07:35.233
My boyfriend left town
the moment he found out about..

07:35.300 --> 07:36.633
I'm sorry. That's too bad.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.733
No, it's okay. It's my fault.

07:38.800 --> 07:42.033
I don't know what possessed me
to go out with that skunk.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.933
Possessed?

07:44.000 --> 07:47.266
I gave birth
to the devil's baby.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.900
That's page 1 material.

07:48.966 --> 07:50.600
Can you fax that
to me by tonight?

07:50.666 --> 07:52.500
Well, I got permission
to shoot the birth.

07:52.566 --> 07:54.733
So, I-I'm gonna have
to bring the negatives back

07:54.800 --> 07:57.600
so the guys in the lab
can add the horns and the tail.

07:57.666 --> 08:00.466
Right. Alright, then I'll see
you after you meet with Elvis.

08:00.533 --> 08:03.000
No, no. But-but
my interview in Chicago..

08:10.433 --> 08:13.833
'Mr. Dittano, would you come
to delivery room, please?'

08:13.900 --> 08:15.266
'Push, Mary.'

08:17.566 --> 08:19.200
Push, Mary.

08:22.333 --> 08:23.400
Push.

08:28.033 --> 08:29.466
The head is almost out.

08:29.533 --> 08:32.266
Something wrong, doc?

08:32.333 --> 08:34.933
No. No, everything's okay.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.533
What...what is it?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.633
No, everything's just fine.

08:39.700 --> 08:42.200
Mary, j-just push one more time.

08:42.266 --> 08:44.000
We're almost finished.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.233
Uh, hey, doc, why don't
you hold the little guy up

08:47.300 --> 08:48.300
so I can get a picture?

08:48.366 --> 08:50.433
No, I would rather
not do that, Mr. Dittano.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.800
May I ask why?

08:51.866 --> 08:54.233
It wouldn't be a good idea.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.133
Oh, please do it, Dr. Coppage.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.800
I wanna have the picture.

09:11.333 --> 09:15.000
Mr. Dittano. Mr. Dittano.

09:15.066 --> 09:17.333
Oh, God.
Doc.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.033
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.733
We've been looking for you

09:20.800 --> 09:22.633
We had to go on
with the delivery.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.700
Oh, damn!
I missed the launch.

09:24.766 --> 09:26.233
Afraid so.

09:26.300 --> 09:31.133
Well, uh, can I, can I
get a shot of the kid?

09:31.200 --> 09:34.133
I'm sorry.
The baby was stillborn.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.033
Oh, God.

09:37.100 --> 09:38.500
The-the mom's okay?

09:38.566 --> 09:40.266
Oh, she's fine.

09:40.333 --> 09:44.200
Thank God she never got an
opportunity to see the child.

09:44.266 --> 09:46.400
Why-why do you say that?

09:46.466 --> 09:49.966
The baby had what we call
bilateral indurated masses

09:50.033 --> 09:52.166
in the parietal region.

09:52.233 --> 09:54.200
Not a pleasant sight.

09:54.266 --> 09:55.933
- I'm sorry.
- Doc. Doc.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.666
Give me that in English.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.233
Mr. Dittano..

10:01.466 --> 10:04.266
'...the child's skull
was malformed'

10:04.333 --> 10:07.400
in a very grotesque way.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.466
Looked almost like it had horns.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.400
Would you cool it?
I'll come up with another story.

10:21.466 --> 10:22.600
'I don't get it, Dittano.'

10:22.666 --> 10:25.600
'Why doesn't the devil's baby
story work?'

10:25.666 --> 10:28.633
Because the baby was stillborn.

10:28.700 --> 10:32.300
But you said it really
had horns. Get some shots of it.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.766
You are one sick puppy.

10:34.833 --> 10:36.166
Oh, well, you're the one
who wants to work

10:36.233 --> 10:38.433
for "Chicago Tribune", 'cause
you can report on real stories.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.600
You've got a real story here,
Dittano.

10:40.666 --> 10:43.033
What real story?
It's not the devil's baby.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.466
And I'm not gonna write
the story saying it is.

10:45.533 --> 10:47.500
Okay. Have it your way.

10:49.133 --> 10:50.833
Uh, by the way,
I've got a letter here for you

10:50.900 --> 10:52.266
from the "New York Times."

10:52.333 --> 10:54.400
'Would you like me
to open it and read it?'

10:54.466 --> 10:55.633
Of course I do.

10:55.700 --> 10:56.966
Okay.

10:59.666 --> 11:04.566
Let's see, "Dear, Mr. Dittano,
thank you for forwarding

11:04.633 --> 11:07.066
"a sample of your writing to us.

11:07.133 --> 11:09.233
'"We regret to inform you'

11:09.300 --> 11:12.066
"however that you showed
an aptitude for punctuation

11:12.133 --> 11:14.400
"and spelling that is far lower

11:14.466 --> 11:16.433
"than is satisfactory
for the "New York Times."

11:16.500 --> 11:19.933
We are therefore
forced to reject you."

11:20.000 --> 11:22.066
'Should I go on?'

11:22.133 --> 11:23.733
No.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.433
If I were you, I'd make an
effort to keep the job I've got.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.600
Come up with another story,
right?

11:29.666 --> 11:31.633
That'd be a good start.

11:37.900 --> 11:38.866
Hey.

11:51.166 --> 11:52.833
Need somethin'?

11:52.900 --> 11:54.233
Is Elvis here yet?

11:54.300 --> 11:56.000
Nope. Not yet.

11:56.066 --> 11:57.933
Of course not.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.233
Anything else?

12:01.300 --> 12:03.266
Not unless you've got
a good story.

12:03.333 --> 12:04.666
Story?

12:04.733 --> 12:07.800
'Yeah, I mean this old hotel has
gotta have some good stories?'

12:07.866 --> 12:09.466
Anything weird
ever happen here?

12:09.533 --> 12:10.766
I mean, anybody ever get killed

12:10.833 --> 12:13.066
or the walls ever talk?

12:13.133 --> 12:15.133
'Anybody ever
spontaneously combust?'

12:16.633 --> 12:20.500
Not that I can remember offhand,
but I'll think about it.

12:22.933 --> 12:25.333
What are you waiting for, boy?

12:25.400 --> 12:28.800
If you want any tip at all,
you'd best move that luggage.

12:28.866 --> 12:30.500
'Well, I'm sorry
I'm not the bellboy'

12:30.566 --> 12:32.266
'but I'd be happy
to take your tip.'

12:32.333 --> 12:34.866
George Teller?

12:34.933 --> 12:36.233
Who are you?

12:36.300 --> 12:38.000
I'm Tom Gibson.

12:38.066 --> 12:41.600
Oh...yeah, I remember.

12:41.666 --> 12:43.766
- You own the local paper.
- That's right.

12:43.833 --> 12:47.200
The local paper that took me
a whole lifetime to built.

12:47.266 --> 12:50.100
Really?
A whole lifetime.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.733
That's funny.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.100
Should take me
just one day to destroy it.

12:54.166 --> 12:56.800
Replace you with
someone younger and hipper.

12:56.866 --> 12:57.833
Oh, you..

12:57.900 --> 13:00.000
...heartless, good-for-nothing--

13:00.066 --> 13:02.033
- Come on, Lou.
- You son of a bitch!

13:02.100 --> 13:04.300
That paper's like
a family to me!

13:09.000 --> 13:11.733
That-that was George Teller,
the newspaper tycoon.

13:12.866 --> 13:15.400
There was that
murder last year.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.366
What?

13:19.433 --> 13:21.766
Uh, there was a murder
in the hotel.

13:21.833 --> 13:23.000
Oh, yeah?

13:23.066 --> 13:24.833
Well, what happened?

13:24.900 --> 13:27.633
- Man got killed.
- And?

13:27.700 --> 13:29.433
- That's it.
- What do you mean, "That's it?"

13:29.500 --> 13:32.566
There-there's got to be more.
I mean, do you know who did it?

13:32.633 --> 13:34.966
No. Never caught the guy.

13:35.033 --> 13:36.500
I saw him run out.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.900
Oh, great, great.
Well-well, what'd he look like?

13:38.966 --> 13:40.900
Never saw his face.

13:45.866 --> 13:48.633
Couldn't see his face.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.633
Didn't have a mask.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.300
No.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.866
Didn't have a face.

14:00.400 --> 14:04.433
"Faceless man
electrocutes hotel guest"

14:04.500 --> 14:06.033
by Roger Dittano.

14:07.466 --> 14:11.833
Old James Williams, the handyman
at the Springwood Hotel

14:11.900 --> 14:16.800
was defaced a year ago
in a bizarre accident with a..

14:16.866 --> 14:18.833
...traveling chainsaw salesman.

14:21.533 --> 14:23.200
...horse is lost.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.233
Ah-h-h!

15:18.900 --> 15:22.733
I'm telling you,
it is just too weird.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.233
Everything I write comes true.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.833
That's a very imaginative
excuse, Dittano.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.666
It is not an excuse.

15:29.733 --> 15:31.900
Alright, first the baby
with the horns

15:31.966 --> 15:34.566
then I almost get
electrocuted in the bathtub.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.666
I'm-I'm almost afraid
to write anything.

15:37.733 --> 15:39.733
Very convenient, Rog.

15:39.800 --> 15:40.800
Can't write in Springwood

15:40.866 --> 15:42.066
so you might as well
come home, huh?

15:42.133 --> 15:44.166
Just in time for your
next job interview, right?

15:44.233 --> 15:47.266
No. No, I am gonna write
your story for you.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.266
But it's gonna be
a happy story.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.533
That way, if it comes true

15:51.600 --> 15:52.900
it'll be okay.

15:52.966 --> 15:55.733
Happy stories don't sell papers.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.200
I want grotesque, weird

15:58.266 --> 16:01.266
violent,
your usual wonderful stuff.

16:01.333 --> 16:03.566
I don't think I can do that.

16:03.633 --> 16:05.533
'Well, then, perhaps you should
write a story about how you won'

16:05.600 --> 16:06.733
the lottery, because
you're gonna need

16:06.800 --> 16:08.433
the cash after I fire you.

16:11.366 --> 16:13.000
Go ahead and hang up on me,
you witch.

16:13.066 --> 16:15.533
I don't need your ten-dollar
a week job, anyway.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.533
Besides, I never wanna
see your ugly face again!

16:17.600 --> 16:18.900
I quit!

16:27.400 --> 16:28.466
Hey.

16:28.533 --> 16:30.000
What now?

16:30.066 --> 16:33.233
Thought you'd like to know,
Elvis is dead.

16:33.300 --> 16:35.733
Thank you for that newsflash.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.933
Oh, and you've got a message.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.633
From whom?

16:39.700 --> 16:43.200
Uh, a fellow named Levine, uh,
from the "Chicago Tribune."

16:43.266 --> 16:45.233
Oh. W-w-what'd he say?

16:45.300 --> 16:47.866
He said don't bother
about coming to Chicago

16:47.933 --> 16:51.333
for an interview.
He read your stuff.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.633
Damn!

16:54.266 --> 16:56.466
Oh, yes, uh,
you got another message.

16:56.533 --> 16:57.500
Oh.

16:57.566 --> 16:59.766
Someone named Ellen called.

16:59.833 --> 17:03.800
She said, since you don't want
to ever see her ugly face again

17:03.866 --> 17:04.933
you're fired.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.633
She heard me?
Oh, I thought she hung up.

17:07.700 --> 17:11.033
'And she's not gonna pay
for the hotel bill.'

17:13.100 --> 17:15.166
What about the hotel bill?

17:15.233 --> 17:17.433
Don't-don't worry.
I'll-I'll take care of it.

17:21.966 --> 17:24.166
I demand a new room.

17:24.233 --> 17:27.300
Half of lights in my room won't
go on, and the TV doesn't work.

17:28.466 --> 17:30.500
Hotel's full.
Got no more rooms.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.900
You must find another room

17:40.966 --> 17:43.100
Wish I did. But I don't.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.866
Excuse me, Mr. Teller,
I-I couldn't help overhearing.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.633
Um, I would be happy
to trade rooms with you.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.933
Who are you?

17:53.000 --> 17:54.633
Roger Dittano is my name.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.633
I-I-I work for
a...a small paper.

17:59.833 --> 18:02.400
Suppose you're
looking for a job.

18:02.466 --> 18:05.933
Well, I-I'm entertaining offers
from several of the more

18:06.000 --> 18:09.133
prominent papers, but I would
certainly consider, uh..

18:10.333 --> 18:12.033
Forget it.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.466
I don't hire slobs.

18:14.533 --> 18:16.533
Well, this isn't slob,
this is young and hip.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.166
Hey, watch it!

18:18.233 --> 18:20.233
I have a black belt in-in..

18:21.166 --> 18:23.100
...several martial arts.

18:25.033 --> 18:27.000
Have a nice day.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.933
Billionaire takes poison.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.100
No.

18:51.766 --> 18:55.366
Billionaire leaves
newspaper empire to reporter

18:55.433 --> 18:57.766
after he takes poison.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.266
Like that.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.866
Look, I wanna see Mr. Teller.

19:11.933 --> 19:15.200
'Well, if it isn't the slob.'

19:15.266 --> 19:17.266
Look, you got me all wrong,
Mr. Teller.

19:17.333 --> 19:18.766
Oh, do I?

19:18.833 --> 19:21.366
Alright, I might look
like a slob.

19:21.433 --> 19:23.500
Hell, I might even be a slob.

19:23.566 --> 19:26.866
But I am a young, hip,
smart...slob.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.300
Just the kind you need to run
this paper you're taking over.

19:29.366 --> 19:30.333
I know.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.366
I mean, I've got five-years

19:31.433 --> 19:33.666
experience in the newspa..

19:33.733 --> 19:35.100
What did you say?

19:35.166 --> 19:38.100
I said, I know
you're the man for the job.

19:39.866 --> 19:42.666
One minute...down at the lobby,
you-you said..

19:42.733 --> 19:44.666
I was just testing you.

19:44.733 --> 19:46.733
I need a man who's a fighter.

19:46.800 --> 19:50.333
A man who won't
take no for an answer.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.800
Well, that's me.

19:52.866 --> 19:54.633
I can see that.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.400
You've got the job.

19:56.466 --> 19:59.066
Thank you...sir.

19:59.133 --> 20:00.833
Let's drink to it.
Lou!

20:18.233 --> 20:20.366
What's in that?

20:20.433 --> 20:22.566
What's in it?

20:22.633 --> 20:25.633
Well, let's see if it's the way
Lou usually makes it.

20:25.700 --> 20:28.500
It's got, uh, vodka

20:28.566 --> 20:31.933
peach schnapps,
orange juice

20:32.000 --> 20:35.033
and, uh, just a touch
of arsenic.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.133
Arsenic in my drink?

20:39.200 --> 20:40.733
That's not
what I wrote.

20:48.166 --> 20:50.900
Oh, and I'd like to leave you

20:50.966 --> 20:53.200
my newspaper empire.

21:13.566 --> 21:15.633
Excuse me,
are you Dr. Coppage?

21:15.700 --> 21:17.633
- Yes.
- I'm Ellen Kramer.

21:17.700 --> 21:19.833
I was told to see you
about making arrangements

21:19.900 --> 21:21.400
to bring Roger Dittano's body

21:21.466 --> 21:23.133
and his effects back home?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.033
Yes, his things
are right over there.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.833
The police
just brought them.

21:26.900 --> 21:29.900
Please accept
my condolences.

21:29.966 --> 21:31.633
Uh, thanks.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.900
Have you determined
the cause of death?

21:33.966 --> 21:34.933
Yes.

21:42.766 --> 21:44.733
It seems..

21:44.800 --> 21:47.266
'...he choked
on one of these.'

21:51.200 --> 21:53.766
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.733
'Billionaire leaves
newspaper empire to reporter'

22:07.800 --> 22:10.833
'after he takes poison.'

22:10.900 --> 22:14.633
You never learnt your pronouns,
did you, Dittano?

22:14.700 --> 22:21.133
Who took the poison?
Billionaire or reporter?

22:27.733 --> 22:30.033
- Who is that?
- Elvis.

22:31.866 --> 22:33.066
Is he dead?

22:33.133 --> 22:35.500
Of course,
everyone knows that.

22:37.466 --> 22:39.666
Excuse me, uh, wait, wait.

22:39.733 --> 22:40.733
Just a minute please.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.900
Now, there's a good reason
to do your English homework.

22:47.966 --> 22:49.500
Learn the use

22:49.566 --> 22:51.933
of the proper pronoun..

22:52.000 --> 22:53.700
...or die!

23:15.566 --> 23:18.400
I'm, uh, looking
for a Dr. Coppage.

23:18.466 --> 23:21.500
I'm Dr. Coppage,
what can I do for you?

23:21.566 --> 23:24.200
I'm Rachel Kelly,
this is my daughter Salley

23:24.266 --> 23:26.333
We drove all the way
from Copperton.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.766
As soon as we saw
this in the paper.

23:28.833 --> 23:31.366
Oh, yes,
our amnesia victim.

23:31.433 --> 23:33.066
He's been here
for three weeks.

23:33.133 --> 23:35.833
- Do you know him?
- He's my husband.

23:35.900 --> 23:39.533
Good, we were hoping
his family would surface.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.000
How is he?

23:41.066 --> 23:43.433
Well, considering
he was thrown from a car

23:43.500 --> 23:44.833
after it went over a cliff

23:44.900 --> 23:47.833
'he's in pretty good shape,
physically.'

23:47.900 --> 23:50.200
- Can we see him?
- Of course.

23:50.266 --> 23:51.500
Follow me.

24:46.666 --> 24:49.800
- Are you okay, sweetheart?
- Who are you?

24:53.133 --> 24:56.966
Don't you recognize us,
Jerry?

24:57.033 --> 24:58.600
Is that my name? Jerry?

25:01.200 --> 25:02.600
Hi, daddy.

25:06.300 --> 25:07.466
Daddy?

25:07.533 --> 25:09.700
This is your wife
and your daughter.

25:09.766 --> 25:12.133
'Do they look
at all familiar?'

25:18.466 --> 25:19.433
No.

25:25.466 --> 25:26.700
Me?

25:26.766 --> 25:29.666
I cherish my memories.

25:29.733 --> 25:32.733
Yes, playing with bodies
in the winter.

25:32.800 --> 25:36.433
Torturing small animals
in the spring.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.466
Scaring old ladies
in the fall.

25:39.533 --> 25:42.433
Oh, yes, I remember it well.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.900
Too bad poor Jerry can't.

25:44.966 --> 25:47.100
But don't worry.

25:47.166 --> 25:49.200
What I'm gonna do to him

25:49.266 --> 25:50.633
he'll never forget.

25:53.300 --> 25:55.233
'There, that's last Christmas.'

25:55.300 --> 25:59.166
I gave you
a new golf shirt.

25:59.233 --> 26:00.300
No?

26:02.033 --> 26:05.233
Wh-why aren't there
any here of me and Salley?

26:07.133 --> 26:10.166
- Uh, well, uh...
- 'It's okay, honey.'

26:10.233 --> 26:11.933
The bad things
are part of his memory too.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.600
What? What is it?

26:13.666 --> 26:16.200
I-i-it's no big deal.

26:16.266 --> 26:18.366
It's just that,
you and I haven't

26:18.433 --> 26:19.933
been getting along
so well lately.

26:20.000 --> 26:20.966
Why not?

26:21.033 --> 26:22.533
Oh, well..

26:22.600 --> 26:23.633
...it...you were
just being

26:23.700 --> 26:26.966
a typically overprotective
daddy, that's all.

26:27.033 --> 26:28.433
Salley's growing up.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.200
She's driving,
and dating.

26:30.266 --> 26:33.766
And I'm afraid you didn't
handle it very well.

26:33.833 --> 26:35.800
Here, look at some more,
they'll maybe help you remember.

26:37.166 --> 26:40.033
- That's our house.
- Hmm.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.966
And that's the den.

26:42.033 --> 26:44.766
Right after you finished
painting it.

26:44.833 --> 26:48.700
Took you two weeks.

26:48.766 --> 26:51.666
You remember that, Jerry?

27:09.500 --> 27:12.266
'How's the photo session going?'

27:12.333 --> 27:13.700
Huh?
I'm sorry?

27:13.766 --> 27:16.366
Family pictures,
stirring any memories?

27:16.433 --> 27:18.766
Oh, I'm not sure.

27:18.833 --> 27:21.333
Well, don't worry,
it takes time.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.100
Is there anything we can do
to speed up this process?

27:24.166 --> 27:27.600
Well, the only other thing
you can do is to let him sleep.

27:27.666 --> 27:31.100
The first memories to return
are usually in the subconscious.

27:31.166 --> 27:33.300
- In dreams.
- Great.

27:33.366 --> 27:35.133
When do I get to sleep?

27:35.200 --> 27:37.800
You will, I'll prescribe
some sleeping pills.

28:12.100 --> 28:14.200
It's time for your
midnight injection, Mr. Kelly.

28:14.266 --> 28:16.433
It's okay, it's alright.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.233
There you are.

28:24.300 --> 28:25.300
Goodnight.

28:39.233 --> 28:41.033
So, Mr. Kelly?

28:41.100 --> 28:42.466
How'd you sleep?

28:42.533 --> 28:44.000
Not so good.

28:44.066 --> 28:45.800
I have a question.

28:45.866 --> 28:48.166
You said that my memories
might come back

28:48.233 --> 28:49.866
in my dreams first, right?

28:49.933 --> 28:51.300
Yes, that's right.

28:51.366 --> 28:52.933
Alright, does that mean

28:53.000 --> 28:56.900
that whatever
I see in my dreams

28:56.966 --> 28:59.333
are memories
that actually happened?

28:59.400 --> 29:01.533
'No, no not necessarily.'

29:01.600 --> 29:04.033
Now, they could be memories
of a TV show

29:04.100 --> 29:07.466
or a movie that you watched
just before your accident.

29:07.533 --> 29:09.166
Just about anything.

29:09.233 --> 29:10.700
Why?

29:10.766 --> 29:13.166
Did you remember
something last night?

29:13.233 --> 29:16.933
Uhh, I've been having
several nightmares.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.700
'Very disturbing ones.'

29:18.766 --> 29:20.033
About what?

29:20.100 --> 29:23.500
Just, uh, pieces of-of things.

29:24.366 --> 29:25.533
It doesn't make any sense.

29:31.433 --> 29:33.266
Hmm.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.300
Well, I wouldn't worry.

29:35.366 --> 29:38.733
They probably were
just nightmares.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.000
Look around you, honey.

29:40.066 --> 29:42.233
Look at the pictures
in this book.

29:42.300 --> 29:44.233
You have a beautiful home

29:44.300 --> 29:46.100
and you have
a loving family.

29:46.166 --> 29:47.933
You've got a past
anybody would cherish.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.700
Yes, don't block it out,
Mr. Kelly.

29:50.766 --> 29:52.000
Now, you've gotta
do everything

29:52.066 --> 29:53.900
in your power to regain
your memories.

29:53.966 --> 29:55.433
Now, study these pictures.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.500
And talk to your wife
and your daughter..

29:57.566 --> 29:59.300
...and sleep.

29:59.366 --> 30:00.433
'Wouldn't he make
more progress'

30:00.500 --> 30:02.433
if we could take him home?

30:02.500 --> 30:04.433
Where he could see
these things first hand?

30:12.100 --> 30:15.300
Umm, I don't think that, uh,
we should drive home yet.

30:15.366 --> 30:17.200
'No, I don't either.'

30:17.266 --> 30:19.200
It's not advisable
for a person

30:19.266 --> 30:21.600
with a serious head trauma
to travel long distances.

30:22.666 --> 30:23.966
What about a hotel?

30:24.033 --> 30:26.933
Wouldn't you be more comfortable
in a hotel room?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.800
Can I do that?

30:31.133 --> 30:34.533
Well, we could switch you
to outpatient status

30:34.600 --> 30:36.900
as long as you promise
to stay in bed

30:36.966 --> 30:38.133
once you get
to the hotel.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.533
Yeah.

30:39.600 --> 30:40.933
It might help
your memory come back

30:41.000 --> 30:43.133
if we could spend
more time together.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.833
'As a family.'

30:52.633 --> 30:56.033
I-I, I really wouldn't mind
getting out of this hospital.

31:16.100 --> 31:18.033
You have terrible
taste in clothes.

31:21.033 --> 31:23.533
Lucky I have a good taste
in wives.

31:51.766 --> 31:54.000
What, don't tell me
we weren't getting along either?

31:54.066 --> 31:56.400
Oh, no, no,
that's not it.

31:56.466 --> 31:57.833
What then?

31:57.900 --> 31:59.533
Can't a man
kiss his wife?

31:59.600 --> 32:02.200
His very sexy wife?

32:04.900 --> 32:07.066
Sure he can.

32:07.133 --> 32:09.066
But you never did.

32:09.133 --> 32:11.633
Not like that, at least.

32:11.700 --> 32:14.433
You haven't kissed me like that
since our honeymoon.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.900
You kidding me?

32:17.533 --> 32:19.266
No.

32:19.333 --> 32:21.300
Well, that's about to change.

32:28.866 --> 32:31.366
Hey..

32:31.433 --> 32:33.966
The doctor said you're supposed
to get some rest.

32:34.033 --> 32:35.966
You're supposed
to stay in bed.

32:36.033 --> 32:38.366
Well, that's where
I was headed, the bed.

32:41.966 --> 32:44.666
Now, why don't you
get some sleep?

32:44.733 --> 32:47.333
I'm gonna take a bath.

32:59.800 --> 33:02.266
- Come in.
- Hi.

33:02.333 --> 33:04.466
I was just wondering
how you're doing.

33:04.533 --> 33:07.433
I'm fine. I'm studying.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.266
Yeah, what subject?

33:09.333 --> 33:12.200
- Calculus.
- Oh, boy.

33:12.266 --> 33:13.600
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

33:13.666 --> 33:16.266
I forgot,
we're not getting along.

33:16.333 --> 33:17.400
It's okay.

33:18.766 --> 33:20.333
No, Salley,
i-it's not okay.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.733
S-s-sit down, will you?

33:27.166 --> 33:30.700
Salley, sometimes parents
do things that they shouldn't

33:30.766 --> 33:32.500
just like kids.

33:32.566 --> 33:33.600
Now, I don't pretend
to remember

33:33.666 --> 33:34.633
what it is I did to you

33:34.700 --> 33:37.200
but it obviously upset you
very, very much.

33:37.266 --> 33:40.066
I-I just want to say
that I'm sorry.

33:40.133 --> 33:43.133
You think maybe we could just
forget about the whole thing?

33:43.200 --> 33:45.933
I certainly have.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.700
What do you say, huh?

33:47.766 --> 33:50.300
Clean slate?
Fresh start?

33:53.833 --> 33:56.200
Yeah, that's it.

33:56.266 --> 33:59.033
Now, aren't you
supposed to be in bed?

33:59.100 --> 34:01.600
Yeah, well, I'm too restless,
I can't sleep.

34:01.666 --> 34:03.833
Isn't that why the doctor
gave you those sleeping pills?

34:03.900 --> 34:06.800
Yeah, yeah, alright,
I'll go to sleep.

34:06.866 --> 34:08.833
You go back to your Calculus.

34:15.066 --> 34:17.600
I see, you've, uh,
got your old man's brains.

34:20.433 --> 34:21.433
Yeah.

34:25.366 --> 34:26.333
Goodnight.

34:34.700 --> 34:36.900
Well, hello, there.

34:38.333 --> 34:39.766
Hi.

34:39.833 --> 34:40.966
What are you doing here?

34:41.033 --> 34:42.800
Well, I'm just looking
for my sleeping pills.

34:42.866 --> 34:45.700
I thought you might
know where they are.

34:45.766 --> 34:48.100
Oh. Pier on the dresser.

34:49.800 --> 34:50.900
Well, thanks.

35:38.566 --> 35:40.700
- Rachel, who's this?
- Huh!

35:40.766 --> 35:41.766
Huh?

35:41.833 --> 35:43.800
- Where'd you get that?
- In your purse.

35:43.866 --> 35:45.300
I was looking for my pills
Answer the question.

35:45.366 --> 35:46.833
Who's that man?

35:46.900 --> 35:49.766
It's Frank.
He's your business partner.

35:49.833 --> 35:53.733
Oh, yeah? How come he's so cozy
with you in this picture?

35:53.800 --> 35:55.300
He's our best friend.

35:55.366 --> 35:57.066
Look.

35:57.133 --> 35:59.100
He introduced us,
for Christ sake.

36:03.966 --> 36:05.866
I'm sorry.
I-I-I'm sorry...

36:05.933 --> 36:07.200
I-I thought, I-I..

36:09.700 --> 36:11.633
You still don't remember
anything, do you?

36:14.633 --> 36:16.466
Just pieces.

36:16.533 --> 36:17.833
Why don't you take
another sleeping pill

36:17.900 --> 36:19.200
and go back to sleep?

36:30.266 --> 36:33.000
My God, it's hard to believe
I can't remember you.

37:06.700 --> 37:08.233
Sorry, partner.

38:01.766 --> 38:03.633
- Honey.
- What, what is it?

38:03.700 --> 38:05.500
I'm-I'm sorry, I couldn't wait,
I had to ask you.

38:05.566 --> 38:06.566
- What?
- Where is he?

38:06.633 --> 38:07.600
- Who?
- The man in the photo?

38:07.666 --> 38:11.000
Frank, my partner,
where is he?

38:11.066 --> 38:14.766
Well, honey,
Frank's dead.

38:14.833 --> 38:17.766
- How did he die?
- He had a heart attack.

38:17.833 --> 38:19.900
- Where?
- In our den.

38:19.966 --> 38:23.300
- Why're you asking me all the..
- Where in the den did he die?

38:23.366 --> 38:25.766
Well, it was
by the fireplace.

38:25.833 --> 38:28.566
Why, what is it?
Are you remembering something?

38:28.633 --> 38:31.900
I dreamt it, all of it,
in every single detail.

38:31.966 --> 38:33.466
That's great.

38:33.533 --> 38:35.666
Now, there was
one added thing.

38:35.733 --> 38:36.933
What?

38:37.000 --> 38:38.600
I did it, I killed him.

38:38.666 --> 38:40.500
I hit him on the head
with a rock

38:40.566 --> 38:43.100
and then I injected air
into his veins.

38:47.666 --> 38:49.400
Don't be silly, Jerry.

38:49.466 --> 38:51.266
I was there.

38:51.333 --> 38:53.566
You told me that
he had a heart attack.

38:53.633 --> 38:55.266
And he fell
and hit his head.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.266
And the coroner's
report confirmed that.

38:57.333 --> 39:00.433
Why would every single detail
be right, except for one?

39:03.033 --> 39:05.100
I don't know.

39:05.166 --> 39:07.833
Maybe your memory's
still scrambled.

39:07.900 --> 39:09.933
Can you remember
anything else?

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
No.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.700
Why don't you try
and go back to sleep?

39:22.766 --> 39:24.333
Oh, God.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.333
Maybe some more of it
will come to you if you do

41:03.233 --> 41:04.900
Sorry, partner.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.033
Jerry!

41:59.833 --> 42:01.433
He collapsed.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.233
He died in my arms.

42:10.466 --> 42:11.833
Frank.

42:13.833 --> 42:16.400
Frank.
Oh, God!

42:16.466 --> 42:17.700
Frank.

42:28.166 --> 42:30.766
You remember now, Jerry?

42:30.833 --> 42:32.833
What's going on?
What are you doing?

42:32.900 --> 42:35.933
Good thing
daddy invited you over so often.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.533
We have a lot of good pictures
to jog your memory.

42:41.633 --> 42:44.000
My husband
was a good man, Jerry.

42:44.800 --> 42:46.200
Your husband?

42:49.300 --> 42:50.533
Jesus.

42:53.233 --> 42:55.433
I killed your husband.

42:57.533 --> 42:58.933
See, Salley.

43:00.366 --> 43:02.433
I told you he remembered.

43:04.833 --> 43:07.433
Why'd you do it, Jerry?

43:07.500 --> 43:08.566
Just didn't wanna
share the wealth

43:08.633 --> 43:10.600
with your partner anymore?

43:13.566 --> 43:14.833
Alright, okay.

43:14.900 --> 43:16.800
So...what are you gonna do?

43:16.866 --> 43:18.400
You gonna turn me in?

43:18.466 --> 43:19.533
No way.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.800
You'd probably just got to jail
for a few years.

43:23.066 --> 43:24.566
How did you know that I did it?

43:24.633 --> 43:26.833
Oh, I always knew.

43:26.900 --> 43:28.633
I just didn't know how.

43:28.700 --> 43:31.366
Until you told me.

43:31.433 --> 43:34.800
'You injected air
into his veins.'

43:34.866 --> 43:37.466
'It's a perfect crime.'

43:37.533 --> 43:38.900
'And the authorities
are gonna think'

43:38.966 --> 43:41.300
'that you died
of a heart attack too.'

43:41.366 --> 43:42.733
'Just like Frank.'

43:45.766 --> 43:47.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait a minute.

43:47.066 --> 43:49.966
I wonder what air
in the veins feels like.

43:50.033 --> 43:52.000
- 'Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa.'
- 'You think it hurts?'

43:52.066 --> 43:53.433
Why did you go to
all this trouble?

43:53.500 --> 43:55.700
Why didn't you just kill me
when you had a chance?

44:01.666 --> 44:03.333
Oh, Jerry.

44:04.800 --> 44:07.200
Because revenge is only sweet

44:07.266 --> 44:09.900
when the person you're punishing
knows what they did.

44:10.666 --> 44:12.633
'It took you a while.'

44:12.700 --> 44:14.833
But you finally remembered.

44:14.900 --> 44:17.300
Talk to me, talk to me.
What-what-what-what do you want?

44:17.366 --> 44:18.866
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

44:18.933 --> 44:19.933
What do you..

44:20.000 --> 44:21.366
What-what-what do you want?

44:21.433 --> 44:23.100
Goodbye, Jerry.

44:23.166 --> 44:24.666
Have fun in hell.

44:24.733 --> 44:26.433
Wait a minute. Wait! Wait!
Wait! Whoa! Whoa!

44:26.500 --> 44:30.233
'No! No! No, no, talk to me!
Wait, talk, no!'

44:30.300 --> 44:31.400
Wait! Wait!

44:31.466 --> 44:32.433
No!

44:35.833 --> 44:37.466
Memories..

44:37.533 --> 44:41.433
...light the corner of my mind.

44:48.600 --> 44:50.933
Medulla oblongata.
