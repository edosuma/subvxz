Previously on
<i>Sanctuary...</i>

00:01.472 --> 00:02.640
All right.

00:02.642 --> 00:03.708
Adam, what are
you doing here?

00:03.710 --> 00:05.743
Helen, I'm sorry
to intrude.

00:05.745 --> 00:06.978
James.

00:06.980 --> 00:08.079
Burnt down any more
laboratories recently?

00:08.080 --> 00:10.248
That was 10 years ago,
and it was an accident.

00:10.250 --> 00:11.249
Really?

00:11.251 --> 00:12.617
What do you want, Adam?

00:12.619 --> 00:13.885
It's me daughter, imogene.

00:13.887 --> 00:16.053
She's gravely ill,
a rare blood disease.

00:16.055 --> 00:17.688
I beg of you, help her.

00:17.690 --> 00:20.658
We battled
until the very end.

00:20.660 --> 00:22.026
We tried everything.

00:22.028 --> 00:24.796
Loss of a daughter,
it's a wound that never heals.

00:26.766 --> 00:28.166
He told me

00:28.168 --> 00:29.867
he intended to use the device
to save his daughter.

00:30.055 --> 00:32.287
Time travel?

00:32.290 --> 00:33.289
It's impossible.

00:33.291 --> 00:34.691
But he said he'd found a way.

00:34.693 --> 00:36.759
You would have been
altering the course of history.

00:36.761 --> 00:38.294
That was the point.

00:38.296 --> 00:39.829
If Adam succeeds in
altering the timeline,

00:39.831 --> 00:41.397
then everything
about our world,

00:41.399 --> 00:43.366
the refugees,
the Sanctuary,

00:43.368 --> 00:45.635
our very lives will be
irreparably damaged.

00:45.637 --> 00:47.370
We may even
cease to exist.

00:47.372 --> 00:48.605
Praxis...

00:48.607 --> 00:50.640
It's gone.

00:50.642 --> 00:51.708
What happened here?

00:51.710 --> 00:52.875
Worth.

00:52.877 --> 00:53.710
He must have made
another attempt

00:53.712 --> 00:54.744
to power up the machine.

00:57.549 --> 00:58.381
Adam,
what are you doing?

00:58.383 --> 00:59.382
This is madness.

00:59.384 --> 01:00.950
I have a chance
to get my daughter back.

01:00.952 --> 01:03.119
Are you telling me
you wouldn't do the same thing?

01:03.121 --> 01:05.388
Not at the expense
of everyone on the planet.

01:05.390 --> 01:06.389
You're too late.

01:30.981 --> 01:31.981
Stay back!

01:35.486 --> 01:36.753
Adam!

01:40.091 --> 01:41.357
What was that?!

01:57.976 --> 01:59.776
Hoping for
a quick finish, Helen?

01:59.778 --> 02:01.077
Me too.

02:09.752 --> 02:11.621
Don't make things worse, Adam.

02:11.623 --> 02:13.489
Neither of us
can be here.

02:13.491 --> 02:15.158
We both know it.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.159
It's only

02:16.161 --> 02:17.727
time travel, Helen.

02:17.729 --> 02:20.096
What's the worst
that could happen?

02:20.098 --> 02:22.532
Aside from destroying
the natural order of history?

02:22.534 --> 02:25.668
What, by creating
a utopia?

02:36.747 --> 02:38.648
By taking over the world.

02:54.999 --> 02:57.066
Over here!

02:57.068 --> 02:58.568
By the rubble.

02:58.570 --> 02:59.669
She's down
the alley, that way!

02:59.671 --> 03:01.637
Call the Bobby!

03:27.197 --> 03:28.698
Hasn't said a word.

03:28.700 --> 03:32.935
Wouldn't let the Doctor
near her, neither.

03:32.937 --> 03:35.304
Has she put up
any kind of resistance?

03:35.306 --> 03:36.806
Been as gentle
as a debutante,

03:36.808 --> 03:39.108
despite all the weapons
we found on her.

03:39.110 --> 03:41.210
Never seen
anything like 'em.

03:41.212 --> 03:43.446
I would say Miss Magnus'
reputation as odd

03:43.448 --> 03:44.847
remains intact.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.916
It's <i> Dr.</i> Magnus,

03:46.918 --> 03:49.552
and I will need everything
you took from her.

03:49.554 --> 03:53.589
Look, there are no charges,
no evidence to suppress.

03:53.591 --> 03:55.825
I'm just making your life
easier, Lestrade,

03:55.827 --> 03:57.226
as usual.

03:57.228 --> 03:58.628
Fine,

03:58.630 --> 04:01.330
but you owe me
for this, Watson.

04:11.842 --> 04:14.010
Are you ready
to come home, Helen?

04:16.647 --> 04:17.980
I received a message

04:17.982 --> 04:19.548
that you'd been found
injured,

04:19.551 --> 04:20.716
half dressed,

04:20.718 --> 04:23.219
and discharging
a weapon in public.

04:24.888 --> 04:26.622
If you had a lead
in the case,

04:26.624 --> 04:29.592
you could at least
have informed me.

04:29.594 --> 04:32.128
I should have,
I realize that.

04:32.130 --> 04:34.197
Th-things just got away
from me, I'm afraid.

04:34.199 --> 04:36.165
It was him, wasn't it?

04:36.167 --> 04:37.767
I was right.

04:37.769 --> 04:40.903
Helen, how could you
face him on your own?

04:40.905 --> 04:43.206
I didn't get a good look
at who it was.

04:43.208 --> 04:44.307
I just...

04:44.309 --> 04:46.676
I got overexcited,

04:46.678 --> 04:48.578
and I fell, and I--

04:48.580 --> 04:49.979
I should've called you--

04:49.981 --> 04:52.782
c-contacted you.

04:52.784 --> 04:55.651
Thank you, James.

04:55.653 --> 04:57.053
"Overexcited"?

04:57.055 --> 04:58.788
That's your explanation

04:58.790 --> 05:01.891
for your incredibly
strange attire,

05:01.893 --> 05:03.159
weapons that I have
never seen--

05:03.161 --> 05:05.928
and your hair,
for God's sake.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.097
When did you do that?

05:08.099 --> 05:09.899
It's late,

05:09.901 --> 05:10.900
and it's been a hell of a night.

05:14.571 --> 05:16.005
Helen, at least let me
take a look at your head.

05:16.007 --> 05:17.073
You--

05:17.075 --> 05:19.308
you've taken a terrible tumble.

05:19.310 --> 05:21.944
I'm fine. Really.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.280
I can see myself home.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.982
Good night, James.

05:27.551 --> 05:28.551
Helen...

05:29.953 --> 05:33.322
What on earth's
come over you?

06:25.642 --> 06:28.144
Dear God, I still have this
in my study.

06:28.146 --> 06:31.614
It arrived yesterday
from Mozambique.

06:35.053 --> 06:36.886
I would say your father
was having a wonderful time

06:36.888 --> 06:38.654
on the dark continent.

06:38.656 --> 06:43.125
I believe he's sent
a new form of iodine.

06:47.731 --> 06:49.732
Let me, James.

06:49.734 --> 06:52.268
Medicine was always
your weak spot.

06:52.270 --> 06:53.202
"Was"?

06:54.604 --> 06:57.039
It's a scalp wound
and a mild concussion.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.274
I hardly need a nursemaid.

07:03.246 --> 07:04.280
Will you stop
looking at me like that?

07:04.282 --> 07:06.749
How should I
be looking at you?

07:06.751 --> 07:08.351
Just...

07:08.353 --> 07:09.618
Leave me alone.

07:17.195 --> 07:19.795
No, no. Don't do that.

07:27.871 --> 07:29.372
What the devil
is that made of?

07:33.910 --> 07:34.944
These numbers,

07:34.946 --> 07:36.846
are they
significant?

07:40.017 --> 07:43.152
This?
What's the...

07:43.154 --> 07:44.320
The design...

07:44.322 --> 07:47.023
The purpose...

07:49.160 --> 07:50.092
How...

07:50.094 --> 07:51.093
How is that powered?

07:51.095 --> 07:52.294
James,

07:52.296 --> 07:54.163
ignore all of this.

07:54.165 --> 07:55.331
Ignore me.

07:57.067 --> 07:59.035
"Browning automatic"?

07:59.037 --> 08:00.169
I've never heard of that,

08:00.171 --> 08:01.470
and yet, I know

08:01.472 --> 08:02.271
every weapons
manufacturer

08:02.273 --> 08:03.172
in the world.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.746
Amazing!

08:10.748 --> 08:12.114
The release time--

08:12.116 --> 08:13.115
Leave.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.750
Right now.

08:14.752 --> 08:15.851
Not a chance.

08:15.853 --> 08:16.919
It's my Sanctuary.

08:16.921 --> 08:18.220
Is it?

08:20.023 --> 08:21.223
From the moment
you walked in here,

08:21.225 --> 08:22.525
you've been behaving

08:22.527 --> 08:25.361
as if you were visiting
someone's grave.

08:25.363 --> 08:28.731
It may have been your Sanctuary
a long time ago,

08:28.733 --> 08:29.865
but not anymore.

08:32.169 --> 08:33.903
Business cards

08:33.905 --> 08:38.974
made from a substance
I can't identify,

08:38.976 --> 08:44.280
issued 2010,
expires 2015?

08:44.282 --> 08:49.351
Weapons that I have never seen
or heard of.

08:49.353 --> 08:53.756
Clothes designed
for maximum movement

08:53.758 --> 08:55.291
and protection.

08:55.293 --> 08:56.992
I am Helen--

08:56.994 --> 09:00.129
Oh, you definitely <i> are</i>
<i>Helen Magnus,</i>

09:00.131 --> 09:01.831
just not of this era.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.101
I'm a...

09:05.103 --> 09:06.068
Detective.

09:07.137 --> 09:09.171
Well, then.

09:09.173 --> 09:12.975
Now you understand
why you have to leave.

09:12.977 --> 09:15.177
Because
by being here,

09:15.179 --> 09:19.048
you may disrupt
the timeline,

09:19.050 --> 09:21.417
change the future
as you know it.

09:21.419 --> 09:26.222
But how is this
possible?

09:26.224 --> 09:28.457
I came here on a mission.

09:28.459 --> 09:29.959
If I fail,

09:29.961 --> 09:31.360
everything that is meant to be,

09:31.362 --> 09:34.763
everything that I build
from now until my present

09:34.765 --> 09:36.265
could be destroyed.

09:36.267 --> 09:37.500
Who were you chasing?

09:39.903 --> 09:40.903
Honestly,

09:40.905 --> 09:42.338
<i>Helen.</i>

09:44.040 --> 09:45.141
Whatever your mission is,

09:45.143 --> 09:46.075
it's got off
to a very bad start.

09:46.077 --> 09:47.176
You need help,

09:47.178 --> 09:48.444
and seeing as I know the truth,

09:48.446 --> 09:49.879
what choice do you have
but to let me in?

09:52.215 --> 09:54.984
No questions
about the future,

09:54.986 --> 09:57.186
near or distant?

10:00.390 --> 10:01.423
Adam Worth,

10:01.425 --> 10:03.092
that's who
I was chasing.

10:03.094 --> 10:04.093
From Oxford?

10:04.095 --> 10:05.027
What on earth--

10:05.029 --> 10:07.229
He's come
from the future as well.

10:07.231 --> 10:10.232
I followed him here
after John and I were--

10:10.234 --> 10:12.101
John <i> Druitt</i> ?

10:12.103 --> 10:15.204
Dear God, does
everyone from our era

10:15.206 --> 10:18.007
live on to
the 21st century?

10:19.509 --> 10:21.177
Not everyone.

10:23.079 --> 10:24.947
Oh.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.919
I'll tell you
only what you need to know

10:29.921 --> 10:31.854
to prevent Adam from
irrevocably damaging the future,

10:31.856 --> 10:33.055
nothing more.

10:33.057 --> 10:34.223
Time travel
is actually possible.

10:34.225 --> 10:36.492
H.G. would be ecstatic.

10:36.494 --> 10:39.862
But by simply being here,

10:39.864 --> 10:41.997
haven't you already
changed things?

10:41.999 --> 10:44.233
I'll not give you a lesson
in temporal theory, nice try,

10:44.235 --> 10:47.303
but had I arrived
a century,

10:47.305 --> 10:48.704
or even millennia ago,

10:48.706 --> 10:50.539
the effect on my future
would likely be more severe.

10:50.541 --> 10:51.974
So the shorter the time scale,

10:51.976 --> 10:54.243
the less the effect
on the future.

10:54.245 --> 10:56.378
Unless, of course,
Adam does something

10:56.380 --> 10:58.981
to dramatically alter
the course of events.

10:58.983 --> 11:00.449
Or you do.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.385
Do we have a deal?

11:05.388 --> 11:06.555
Everything
you brought with you

11:06.557 --> 11:09.391
must be destroyed.

11:10.560 --> 11:11.860
And you need to change.

12:46.043 --> 12:49.713
Don't even
think about it.

12:49.715 --> 12:51.047
It's a communication
device, isn't it?

12:52.116 --> 12:53.750
Better?

12:53.752 --> 12:56.219
Much.

12:56.221 --> 12:57.253
Good.

12:58.789 --> 13:00.090
No questions.

13:24.281 --> 13:26.082
Imogene?

13:26.084 --> 13:27.250
Imogene...

13:29.253 --> 13:30.787
I need to make another trip
to the apothecary,

13:30.789 --> 13:33.790
I'm afraid, love.

13:33.792 --> 13:35.291
I won't be long.

14:10.262 --> 14:12.328
Oh, it was all worth it.

14:17.868 --> 14:18.902
Papa?

14:20.705 --> 14:23.106
Imogene.

14:23.108 --> 14:25.709
How are you feeling, darling?

14:25.711 --> 14:27.243
Fine.

14:27.245 --> 14:30.680
Just a bit tired.

14:30.682 --> 14:33.917
What did you do
to your hair?

14:33.919 --> 14:37.253
No, no... just a little cut.

14:39.557 --> 14:42.025
I've done the most
wonderful thing.

14:43.761 --> 14:45.328
I've found a cure
for your condition.

14:45.330 --> 14:49.966
But you said there was no--

14:49.968 --> 14:51.701
No, no, no, that's all changed.

14:51.703 --> 14:55.238
For the better, I promise.

15:02.213 --> 15:04.013
Oh no.

15:04.015 --> 15:05.648
What's happened?

15:07.818 --> 15:12.322
No...

15:12.324 --> 15:15.291
Nothing, just...

15:15.293 --> 15:16.726
A little hole.

15:18.162 --> 15:20.130
I can fix that, though.

15:20.132 --> 15:22.232
It's not a problem.

15:23.901 --> 15:24.901
You look good.

15:26.036 --> 15:27.904
Give us a smile.

15:37.214 --> 15:39.082
All right,

15:39.084 --> 15:40.283
let's get a move on.

15:40.285 --> 15:41.618
He should still be
in the city,

15:41.620 --> 15:43.019
but maybe not for long.

15:43.021 --> 15:44.053
The Adam Worth
from your time.

15:44.055 --> 15:46.923
Now, he's come here
for what reason?

15:46.925 --> 15:48.091
Open the door.
Open it now.

15:48.093 --> 15:49.058
I'll throttle ya.

15:49.060 --> 15:49.893
- Sir--
- Look, I'm not joking.

15:50.829 --> 15:52.028
You'll end up
in the garden.

15:52.030 --> 15:53.096
- Open the door--
- I can't.

15:53.098 --> 15:55.598
Thank you.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.833
Adam?

15:56.835 --> 15:57.867
Helen, James.

15:57.869 --> 16:00.103
Sorry to intrude.

16:00.105 --> 16:02.272
Burned any
laboratories recently?

16:02.274 --> 16:04.107
That was 10 years ago,
and it was an accident.

16:04.109 --> 16:06.142
10 years...

16:06.144 --> 16:07.877
Listen, it's
me daughter, Imogene.

16:07.879 --> 16:08.845
She's gravely ill.

16:08.847 --> 16:10.647
It's a rare blood disease.

16:10.649 --> 16:12.015
Now, I've tried
every treatment possible,

16:12.017 --> 16:13.016
every method

16:13.018 --> 16:13.983
and you want my help.

16:15.085 --> 16:16.719
Thank you, Helen,

16:16.721 --> 16:18.721
but actually, I-
I've come for his help.

16:18.723 --> 16:21.124
You see,
she's missing.

16:21.126 --> 16:22.992
Someone's taken her.

16:27.398 --> 16:30.400
I just don't understand
who would do this.

16:30.402 --> 16:32.936
I haven't much money.

16:32.938 --> 16:35.805
She's just a child.

16:35.807 --> 16:37.307
Worth, be a good chap

16:37.309 --> 16:39.108
and ask the night ward for
the visitor manifest, will you?

16:44.415 --> 16:45.648
There's no sign of a struggle.

16:45.650 --> 16:46.649
She went without resistance.

16:46.651 --> 16:48.251
Of course she did.

16:48.253 --> 16:49.986
She thought
he was her father.

16:49.988 --> 16:52.155
In the past I remember,
Adam came to us for help

16:52.157 --> 16:54.123
finding a cure
for Imogene

16:54.125 --> 16:56.192
two months from now.

16:56.194 --> 16:57.727
This moment never happened.

16:57.729 --> 17:00.697
And now this future Adam
has his daughter.

17:00.699 --> 17:02.332
And a cure?

17:02.334 --> 17:07.203
Which means he's already
altered the future, forever.

17:14.310 --> 17:16.445
Please, are there
any clues?

17:16.448 --> 17:17.747
Suspects?

17:17.749 --> 17:19.249
We'd know more

17:19.251 --> 17:20.950
if you told us what
you were working on, Adam.

17:20.952 --> 17:22.185
Well, I told you,

17:22.186 --> 17:24.454
I'm trying to find
a cure for her disease.

17:24.455 --> 17:26.189
Which is an expensive
proposition.

17:26.191 --> 17:28.958
You'd need money,
resources,

17:28.960 --> 17:31.394
which means some sort of
extortion plot

17:31.396 --> 17:32.462
or larcenous act.

17:32.464 --> 17:33.930
What?

17:33.932 --> 17:34.764
No,

17:34.766 --> 17:36.366
I'd never resort
to that--

17:36.368 --> 17:38.101
Those lab fires
were hardly an accident,

17:38.103 --> 17:40.003
and the toxins you were
formulating at Oxford,

17:40.005 --> 17:41.771
I know you've created
prototypes--

17:41.773 --> 17:43.306
My daughter is missing!

17:43.308 --> 17:45.108
And if you want to find her,

17:45.110 --> 17:46.743
you will give us
names, places,

17:46.745 --> 17:48.411
safehouses,

17:48.413 --> 17:50.380
everything
you are secretly planning

17:50.382 --> 17:51.381
to unleash on this city.

17:51.383 --> 17:53.449
You're mad.

17:53.451 --> 17:55.418
Helen,
that's enough.

17:55.420 --> 17:59.222
I thought you
understood my situation.

17:59.224 --> 18:01.024
I guess I know better now.

18:01.026 --> 18:02.759
I'll find her myself.

18:06.997 --> 18:08.965
Has society gone
back to the Dark Ages?

18:08.967 --> 18:10.433
He's done
nothing wrong.

18:10.435 --> 18:11.935
Not yet,

18:11.937 --> 18:13.836
but he will, believe me.

18:13.838 --> 18:16.039
And if you interrogate
him in this manner,

18:16.041 --> 18:17.907
it will be you
who has altered

18:17.909 --> 18:20.343
the natural order
of things.

18:20.345 --> 18:22.879
Helen, you have
far too much knowledge

18:22.881 --> 18:24.180
about this time and place.

18:24.182 --> 18:25.548
Use that carefully.

18:27.284 --> 18:28.818
We need to find Adam,

18:28.820 --> 18:30.153
future-Adam,

18:30.155 --> 18:31.454
before too much damage is done.

18:31.456 --> 18:33.289
Finding people is what I do,

18:33.291 --> 18:34.290
if you recall...

18:35.559 --> 18:36.859
But I will ask you

18:36.861 --> 18:38.962
to curb your temper
as we go forward.

18:40.230 --> 18:41.431
Of course.

18:42.566 --> 18:43.833
James, I'm-I'm sorry.

18:45.235 --> 18:46.469
You can see yourself home.

18:57.048 --> 19:00.817
Don't lie to me!

19:00.819 --> 19:02.051
Five murders,

19:02.053 --> 19:03.519
their throats cut,

19:03.521 --> 19:05.288
their bodies desecrated

19:05.290 --> 19:07.523
in a manner that
few beings can achieve.

19:07.525 --> 19:09.559
Instant escape
from the crime scene?

19:09.561 --> 19:12.028
And so it must be me?

19:12.030 --> 19:13.863
You seem flattered.

19:13.865 --> 19:17.066
Oh, I am.

19:19.203 --> 19:20.603
Deft manner of
proving your innocence,

19:20.605 --> 19:22.939
threatening my life.

19:22.941 --> 19:25.174
Call it
self-preservation.

19:27.077 --> 19:28.311
Why on earth

19:28.313 --> 19:30.279
should I
let you frame me

19:30.281 --> 19:33.483
for crimes I <i> haven't</i>
<i>committed?</i>

19:35.386 --> 19:36.486
Well, if you're innocent,

19:36.488 --> 19:39.088
then you have
nothing to fear

19:43.160 --> 19:45.228
You sound just like James.

19:45.230 --> 19:48.364
How much time have you
been spending together?

19:48.366 --> 19:49.499
And now jealousy.

19:49.501 --> 19:50.900
For whom?

19:52.603 --> 19:54.971
How dare you
question my motives?

19:56.607 --> 19:58.141
My...

19:58.143 --> 20:00.076
Feelings?

20:01.945 --> 20:03.346
You...

20:03.348 --> 20:04.647
You hunt me like an animal.

20:05.883 --> 20:09.118
After all
we've been through.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.220
My heart...

20:11.222 --> 20:13.089
is yours.

20:24.134 --> 20:26.302
Look...

20:26.304 --> 20:27.570
In my face.

20:30.340 --> 20:32.642
Look at my face.

20:35.579 --> 20:36.512
Damn!

21:23.360 --> 21:24.827
Helen?

21:24.829 --> 21:26.395
Over here.

21:26.397 --> 21:28.764
Any word on Adam's
whereabouts?

21:28.766 --> 21:30.533
What's wrong?

21:30.535 --> 21:31.534
Druitt was here.

21:31.536 --> 21:33.202
John?

21:33.204 --> 21:34.904
Are you--
is she--

21:34.906 --> 21:36.339
We're both fine, thank you.

21:36.341 --> 21:38.508
He's not happy
that you like him

21:38.510 --> 21:39.509
for the latest Ripper killings,

21:39.511 --> 21:40.543
made sure I knew it.

21:40.545 --> 21:42.879
Not happy because I'm right?

21:44.248 --> 21:46.549
Oh, all right,
no questions,

21:46.551 --> 21:47.984
I understand.

21:47.986 --> 21:49.352
But you did make a point
of letting me know

21:49.354 --> 21:51.020
that he paid you
a visit,

21:51.022 --> 21:52.355
which I will take to mean

21:52.357 --> 21:53.856
that I must keep focused
on the case.

21:53.858 --> 21:55.024
Adam Worth?

21:55.026 --> 21:57.994
He is expected
at the Reformer Club

21:57.996 --> 21:59.295
in Pall Mall this evening.

21:59.297 --> 22:01.364
Whether it's the future
or the present Adam,

22:01.366 --> 22:02.398
I-I don't know.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.599
Good.

22:03.601 --> 22:05.334
If we hurry,
we'll beat him there.

22:05.336 --> 22:07.103
James,
is that you?

22:10.174 --> 22:11.474
Darling! Hello.

22:11.476 --> 22:12.942
There you are.

22:12.944 --> 22:14.110
Are you ready to work?

22:14.112 --> 22:16.012
Yes, if you are.

22:16.014 --> 22:17.446
Absolutely.

22:17.448 --> 22:20.850
Now, I've been re-thinking
your last theory,

22:20.852 --> 22:23.486
and I found
a few holes, I'm afraid.

22:23.488 --> 22:25.388
Ah.

22:34.031 --> 22:35.398
You can't come in here.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.466
A woman?
Inconceivable.

22:37.468 --> 22:39.535
Simon, come quick.

22:40.837 --> 22:43.873
May I assist you?

22:43.875 --> 22:45.608
I'm here to see
Adam Worth.

22:45.610 --> 22:48.044
I have no record of any guests
for Mr. Worth.

22:48.046 --> 22:51.280
I will gladly leave him
a message, miss...

22:51.282 --> 22:53.449
<i>Dr.</i> Helen Magnus.

22:53.451 --> 22:55.351
Consider it done.

22:55.353 --> 22:56.852
I'll hail you a cab.

22:56.854 --> 22:59.388
I'll only be a minute.

22:59.390 --> 23:02.024
The club is
for members only.

23:02.026 --> 23:04.393
Remove your hand.

23:04.395 --> 23:06.229
Right now--

23:06.231 --> 23:07.530
how dare you?

23:07.532 --> 23:10.366
She's with me.

23:10.368 --> 23:11.867
Whatever took you so long, love?

23:13.270 --> 23:14.437
Shame on you.

23:14.439 --> 23:16.472
She's a lady.

23:18.208 --> 23:20.343
Is that a revolver
under your bustle,

23:20.345 --> 23:21.210
or are you just

23:21.212 --> 23:22.378
happy to see me?

23:22.380 --> 23:23.913
Oh, it's a gun.

23:25.949 --> 23:27.984
Any last words?

23:27.986 --> 23:29.452
Well, "don't shoot!"

23:29.454 --> 23:32.188
Never seems to work with you.

23:32.190 --> 23:34.023
How about,

23:34.025 --> 23:35.458
"kill me here,

23:35.460 --> 23:39.562
and alter the future
in a most dr

23:39.564 --> 23:41.497
the infamous
Helen Magnus,

23:41.499 --> 23:45.101
murderer of a patron
of a gentleman's club.

23:45.103 --> 23:48.137
Quite the departure
from your destiny, I'd say.

23:53.543 --> 23:56.445
Cheers.

23:58.882 --> 24:01.851
I do miss this era.

24:04.187 --> 24:07.323
A simpler, more elegant time.

24:07.325 --> 24:09.625
I will kill you, Adam.

24:09.627 --> 24:10.860
What for?

24:10.862 --> 24:12.228
To save the future?

24:12.230 --> 24:15.331
What makes what we left behind
so precious?

24:15.333 --> 24:17.900
With Praxis destroyed,

24:17.902 --> 24:19.635
God knows what threat
my people are facing

24:19.637 --> 24:21.137
in the present.

24:21.139 --> 24:23.539
Most likely you've created
chaos for Hollow Earth

24:23.541 --> 24:25.107
and the surface

24:25.109 --> 24:26.108
that will take years
to clean up.

24:26.110 --> 24:28.411
None of that has happened yet,

24:28.413 --> 24:29.378
and guess what?

24:29.380 --> 24:30.413
Maybe it never does.

24:30.415 --> 24:33.449
Move on, I say.

24:33.451 --> 24:35.217
Change the future.

24:35.219 --> 24:36.886
Make it
whatever you want it to be.

24:40.057 --> 24:41.424
You know what I find
interesting

24:41.426 --> 24:43.492
is that
you're sitting here,

24:43.494 --> 24:46.195
sipping Brandy with these stiffs

24:46.197 --> 24:48.264
instead of skipping off
into the sunset with Imogene.

24:48.266 --> 24:50.166
I like it here.

24:50.168 --> 24:52.068
There's been a complication.

24:52.070 --> 24:54.470
You haven't
cured her yet.

24:54.472 --> 24:56.439
That's why you're here,

24:56.441 --> 24:58.307
to borrow money
to fund your plan,

24:58.309 --> 25:02.445
which I am certain has gone
entirely pear-shaped.

25:02.447 --> 25:05.614
It's a matter of time, love,
and only that.

25:13.557 --> 25:15.057
Bustle or no,

25:15.059 --> 25:16.258
I'll be out that door

25:16.260 --> 25:17.927
before your head
hits this table.

25:17.929 --> 25:20.429
Doubtful. Simon!

25:20.431 --> 25:23.132
The lady is ready
to leave now.

25:23.134 --> 25:25.134
Thanks for the offer, ma'am,

25:25.136 --> 25:28.471
but I'm a family man,
and a gentleman.

25:41.318 --> 25:42.985
Women.

25:47.324 --> 25:49.158
Dr. Magnus?

25:49.160 --> 25:50.559
Message for you.

26:19.670 --> 26:21.369
James, please.

26:21.371 --> 26:24.706
But you have been through
all this before.

26:24.708 --> 26:25.774
For God's sake,
you could save lives!

26:25.776 --> 26:28.310
We both know I can't interfere.

26:29.158 --> 26:30.492
Then there will be
blood on your hands.

26:30.494 --> 26:32.160
Not if you do your job

26:32.162 --> 26:33.295
and stop looking
for a short cut.

26:33.297 --> 26:34.663
And if your very presence here

26:34.665 --> 26:36.398
has changed
the course of events,

26:36.400 --> 26:37.532
interfered with
the investigation,

26:37.534 --> 26:38.500
what then?

26:38.502 --> 26:40.702
Can you live with that?

26:40.704 --> 26:41.870
No, please, spare me.

26:41.872 --> 26:43.438
I don't want to know the answer.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.806
Because in the future,

26:44.808 --> 26:45.740
emotions,

26:45.742 --> 26:48.310
empathy,

26:48.312 --> 26:49.811
humanity, ceases to exist--

26:49.813 --> 26:51.579
you should have
caught him by now.

26:55.718 --> 26:57.852
Yes, my presence here
may have altered things,

26:57.854 --> 27:00.188
possibly for the worst.

27:00.190 --> 27:02.624
That woman who died tonight
should be the last victim.

27:02.626 --> 27:04.292
But she won't be.

27:05.528 --> 27:08.163
Remember the purpose
of the Sanctuary.

27:09.332 --> 27:11.733
To find and help
unfortunate creatures,

27:11.735 --> 27:14.736
to protect them.
To keep the public safe.

27:14.738 --> 27:16.271
Do that,

27:16.273 --> 27:19.507
and this case will be solved
without any further bloodshed.

27:19.509 --> 27:20.975
And if I can't?

27:20.977 --> 27:23.945
That's an expression
I've rarely heard you use.

27:26.282 --> 27:28.383
What are you making?

27:31.687 --> 27:33.688
Arsenic.

27:35.424 --> 27:37.826
Strychnine..?

27:37.828 --> 27:39.627
A toxin.

27:39.629 --> 27:41.396
A last resort.

27:41.398 --> 27:42.864
To mimic the blood disease
that kills Imogene.

27:42.866 --> 27:44.666
A fail-safe

27:44.668 --> 27:46.401
in case Adam cures her.

27:46.403 --> 27:47.736
Dear God...

27:47.738 --> 27:50.572
I'm not even sure
I can finish making it,

27:50.574 --> 27:53.475
let alone give it to her.

27:53.477 --> 27:54.476
If there was any other way

27:54.478 --> 27:55.643
to stop Adam Worth

27:55.645 --> 27:58.813
from completely
disrupting the timeline...

28:00.783 --> 28:03.651
Humanity isn't completely
dead in the future,

28:03.653 --> 28:04.686
just so you know.

28:06.489 --> 28:08.623
You're going out?
Where?

28:08.625 --> 28:09.824
Hunting.

29:04.747 --> 29:07.482
Your hair.

29:07.484 --> 29:09.350
I like it.

29:09.352 --> 29:11.319
I don't have time
for this, John.

29:11.321 --> 29:13.855
Perhaps I didn't make myself
clear earlier.

29:15.859 --> 29:17.826
Hunting me

29:17.828 --> 29:21.296
will only make things
more difficult for you.

29:21.298 --> 29:22.797
Let me pass.

29:22.799 --> 29:26.000
There's only one way
to make you pay attention.

29:36.545 --> 29:37.645
You're insane.

29:37.647 --> 29:40.281
Oh, very much so.

29:40.283 --> 29:42.450
Fancy some more?

29:55.698 --> 29:56.865
How on earth did you-- ?

30:09.446 --> 30:11.312
How does it feel?

30:11.314 --> 30:14.315
Cold steel
against your jugular?

30:14.317 --> 30:15.617
In the hands of someone

30:15.619 --> 30:16.651
who knows how to
kill you slowly

30:16.653 --> 30:17.919
and has the will
to do it?

30:17.921 --> 30:19.554
H-Helen?

30:19.556 --> 30:22.423
Are you paying
attention?

30:22.425 --> 30:25.927
Stay away from me.

30:45.582 --> 30:48.416
Hello, Jack.

30:55.870 --> 30:57.804
Know my name, do you?

30:57.806 --> 31:01.041
Yes, I know who you are.

31:02.009 --> 31:05.078
Jack knows you.

31:05.080 --> 31:08.348
You're Gregory's
little girl.

31:08.350 --> 31:10.016
My father helped you,
years ago.

31:10.018 --> 31:12.152
Saved your life.

31:12.154 --> 31:14.854
You're not
a little girl anymore.

31:14.856 --> 31:15.956
Older now.

31:15.958 --> 31:19.225
Much, much older.

31:19.227 --> 31:21.995
Smell like
nothing I know.

31:21.997 --> 31:23.863
You promised my father
you wouldn't kill again.

31:23.865 --> 31:25.098
That you'd leave London--

31:25.100 --> 31:26.967
Jack did leave!

31:26.969 --> 31:28.935
People hunted me down,

31:28.937 --> 31:30.370
like a dog!

31:30.372 --> 31:32.839
This is <i> my</i> hunting ground.

31:32.841 --> 31:34.274
If humans hunt Jack,

31:34.276 --> 31:35.508
then Jack hunts humans.

31:35.510 --> 31:37.477
Here! My ground!

31:37.479 --> 31:39.479
The city's bigger.

31:39.481 --> 31:40.814
You'll be found
and killed.

31:40.816 --> 31:43.083
Ah, I'm strong.

31:43.085 --> 31:44.417
I'm too fast for them.

31:44.419 --> 31:45.485
They'll never find me.

31:45.487 --> 31:46.853
I can,

31:46.855 --> 31:48.421
and I will.

31:48.423 --> 31:50.056
You can die
like an animal

31:50.058 --> 31:51.491
or live
with my protection.

31:51.493 --> 31:53.960
Be safe from humans.

31:53.962 --> 31:55.528
Humans can go to hell!

31:55.530 --> 31:56.863
With my help.

31:56.865 --> 32:00.600
If you kill again,
I can't guarantee your safety.

32:00.602 --> 32:02.902
Stop now,
and I'll give you Sanctuary.

32:03.938 --> 32:05.939
You have my word,

32:05.941 --> 32:07.040
and my father's.

32:08.209 --> 32:10.043
I'm your friend.

32:20.254 --> 32:22.956
Spring-heeled Jack.

32:26.594 --> 32:28.895
Thanks, love.

32:30.431 --> 32:32.465
So different.

32:32.467 --> 32:35.035
Such odd looking pieces.

32:35.037 --> 32:36.536
You actually
designed these?

32:36.538 --> 32:37.937
Ah...

32:37.939 --> 32:39.606
Some of them, yes.

32:39.608 --> 32:41.307
To help me?

32:41.309 --> 32:44.911
You are all
I've been thinking about

32:44.913 --> 32:49.382
for a very long time.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.283
Good.

32:50.285 --> 32:52.252
You look tired.

32:52.254 --> 32:56.189
I wish you'd take a rest.

32:56.191 --> 32:58.925
I'm too close here, Imogene.

32:58.927 --> 33:02.095
But once this is done,

33:02.097 --> 33:03.430
we'll be able to get
all the rest we want.

33:05.032 --> 33:06.666
Go places together,

33:06.668 --> 33:09.436
see things you've never seen
that'll amaze you.

33:09.438 --> 33:10.703
Soon, not only

33:10.705 --> 33:13.673
will we be able to
see the world together,

33:13.675 --> 33:17.343
it will be ours for the taking.

33:17.345 --> 33:18.945
Anything you want,

33:18.947 --> 33:21.414
anything at all,

33:21.416 --> 33:22.882
we take it,
control it,

33:22.884 --> 33:26.686
use it to create
whatever future we want.

33:26.688 --> 33:30.323
I've never heard you
talk this way before.

33:30.325 --> 33:32.092
You're different.

33:32.094 --> 33:33.526
So confident.

33:36.597 --> 33:38.198
Chance of getting
a biscuit with me tea?

33:38.200 --> 33:39.566
As his lordship pleases.

33:44.004 --> 33:46.106
This better be good.

33:46.108 --> 33:47.607
I just climbed up
six flights of stairs

33:47.609 --> 33:49.509
in new boots.

33:49.511 --> 33:50.477
I was thinking
about what you said,

33:50.479 --> 33:51.478
and I think you're right.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.080
It isn't John
doing these murders.

33:54.082 --> 33:56.015
I'm listening.

33:56.017 --> 33:57.350
Another creature,

33:57.352 --> 34:00.019
as violent
and dangerous as him,

34:00.021 --> 34:02.622
with its own unique method
of near-instant escape.

34:02.624 --> 34:05.058
As I've been saying,
but as you keep pointing out,

34:05.060 --> 34:07.227
none of the other possibilities
make any sense.

34:07.229 --> 34:08.995
No one can teleport like John.

34:08.996 --> 34:11.231
What about
incredible super strength?

34:11.233 --> 34:12.532
The ability to leap quickly
to high ground.

34:18.672 --> 34:20.273
Rooftops.

34:20.275 --> 34:22.442
Exactly.

34:24.945 --> 34:25.945
You're certain.

34:25.947 --> 34:26.946
Yes, ma'am.

34:26.947 --> 34:29.181
Up those stairs
with a dark wood door.

34:29.184 --> 34:30.550
Thank you.

34:41.562 --> 34:42.629
Dear God, Adam.

34:45.331 --> 34:47.033
Before you start
threatening me,

34:47.034 --> 34:49.369
or shooting me, for that matter,

34:49.371 --> 34:50.637
we still have
that nagging problem

34:50.639 --> 34:52.038
of the witnesses.

34:55.141 --> 34:57.043
Hello.

34:57.045 --> 34:59.212
Imogene.

35:01.148 --> 35:02.515
Dr. Helen Magnus,

35:02.517 --> 35:05.618
this is my
daughter, Imogene.

35:05.620 --> 35:07.253
You must be one of
my dad's colleagues.

35:07.255 --> 35:11.090
He said some friends
might drop by.

35:11.092 --> 35:12.992
How lovely
to meet you, Doctor.

35:12.994 --> 35:15.261
<i>Dr.</i> Helen here

35:15.263 --> 35:19.032
is a ground-breaker,
just like you.

35:20.701 --> 35:22.101
What have you done, Adam?

35:23.270 --> 35:25.305
How are you feeling,
Imogene?

35:25.307 --> 35:27.373
Better than
I have in years.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.375
Thanks to papa here.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.077
No...

35:31.079 --> 35:32.378
Oh yes.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.681
Healthy as a horse,
I'm afraid.

35:34.683 --> 35:36.516
Welcome to
the future, Helen.

35:41.727 --> 35:44.694
So, now that
the game is over,

35:45.334 --> 35:48.235
what say we put away
our guns, yes?

35:48.237 --> 35:50.037
Starting with yours.

35:50.039 --> 35:51.038
Unlikely.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.940
Papa?

35:52.942 --> 35:54.541
Are you going to shoot me

35:54.543 --> 35:58.112
in front of
my own flesh and blood?

35:58.114 --> 35:59.046
That's cold, Helen,

35:59.048 --> 36:00.881
even for you.

36:00.883 --> 36:02.850
What's the meaning
of this?

36:02.852 --> 36:04.084
I'm sorry, Imogene,

36:04.086 --> 36:05.919
but this man
is not your father.

36:05.921 --> 36:07.788
Please,
leave him alone.

36:07.790 --> 36:08.889
I know
it looks like him,

36:08.891 --> 36:11.158
but this man has ended

36:11.160 --> 36:12.493
millions
of innocent lives,

36:12.495 --> 36:14.795
caused unimaginable
destruction.

36:14.797 --> 36:15.863
Don't listen
to her, darling.

36:15.865 --> 36:17.531
All of it lies.

36:17.533 --> 36:19.066
Destroying Praxis?

36:19.068 --> 36:22.136
Altering the timeline?

36:22.138 --> 36:24.305
You have to be stopped, Adam.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.907
Please,
leave him alone!

36:36.885 --> 36:39.420
Papa?

36:39.422 --> 36:40.521
What is that?

36:40.523 --> 36:42.189
Just some insurance.

36:42.191 --> 36:44.325
Stay here.
I won't be long.

36:50.131 --> 36:52.333
Shaming me in front of
my daughter, Helen?

36:52.335 --> 36:53.334
Very impolite!

37:23.498 --> 37:24.631
Oh, bloody hell...

37:30.305 --> 37:32.973
Drop the gun!

37:32.975 --> 37:36.610
I said,
drop the gun!

37:38.546 --> 37:41.215
You just had to get
all high and mighty

37:41.217 --> 37:44.551
with your amazing
future, didn't you?

37:44.553 --> 37:46.587
Couldn't get
with the program. No.

37:49.324 --> 37:50.657
You stupid, small-minded--

38:02.070 --> 38:03.937
Papa?

38:06.274 --> 38:07.107
Adam, no!

38:14.516 --> 38:16.283
Imogene!

38:16.285 --> 38:17.518
No!

38:18.988 --> 38:21.455
Imogene!

38:21.457 --> 38:22.689
Imogene!

38:38.941 --> 38:39.940
Stay back.

38:39.942 --> 38:41.675
Do it, Adam.

38:41.677 --> 38:44.311
We both go.
Neither of us belongs here.

38:44.313 --> 38:47.748
Everything I've worked for,
everything I care about

38:47.750 --> 38:49.149
destroyed!

38:49.151 --> 38:50.250
By you.

38:50.252 --> 38:52.920
I'll kill you for this,
I swear!

39:09.338 --> 39:12.673
Please.
Please, make room.

39:17.946 --> 39:19.046
Dear God.

39:20.982 --> 39:22.182
It's Adam's
daughter.

39:22.184 --> 39:25.419
The eaves must have
collapsed on her.

39:27.722 --> 39:30.357
Imogene?

39:30.359 --> 39:32.226
Get away from her.

39:32.228 --> 39:33.193
I'm so sorry.

39:33.195 --> 39:36.163
Imogene? Imogene?

39:36.165 --> 39:38.699
Imogene?

39:38.701 --> 39:40.067
Imogene...

39:42.837 --> 39:44.838
No...

39:44.840 --> 39:46.340
What have you done?

39:46.342 --> 39:47.174
Both of you!

39:47.176 --> 39:49.009
Adam--

39:49.011 --> 39:50.677
if you'd have helped,
she'd still be alive right now.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.079
Her blood is on your hands.

39:52.081 --> 39:54.081
And your hands!

39:54.083 --> 39:57.017
We'd better be
on our way, Helen.

39:57.019 --> 39:59.353
Oh, that poor man.

40:30.818 --> 40:33.186
Spring-heeled Jack,

40:33.188 --> 40:35.188
the Sanctuary's
newest resident.

40:35.190 --> 40:37.257
I wish I could've
told you earlier.

40:37.259 --> 40:38.659
All that matters is that

40:38.661 --> 40:40.127
the streets of London
are safe again.

40:40.129 --> 40:41.695
As they should be.

40:44.032 --> 40:46.033
I never meant
to burden you, James.

40:46.035 --> 40:47.334
All this knowledge
you have to keep secret.

40:47.336 --> 40:50.971
Oh, I love it,
you know that.

40:50.973 --> 40:54.107
What, all the deductive
reasoning I'll be able to do

40:54.109 --> 40:56.977
with the little tidbits
you've left me?

40:56.979 --> 40:59.413
It's going to keep me occupied
for decades,

40:59.415 --> 41:02.282
if I have that long.

41:02.284 --> 41:04.051
In my future you do,
many of them.

41:04.053 --> 41:07.087
No, I don't want to know.

41:07.089 --> 41:10.457
Far too much information.

41:12.093 --> 41:14.728
Now that we've cleaned up
all evidence of Adam,

41:14.730 --> 41:17.331
and the technology
he brought with him,

41:17.333 --> 41:21.468
I suppose there's only
one thing left undone.

41:21.470 --> 41:24.004
What to do about you.

41:24.006 --> 41:25.339
I can't be here, James.

41:25.341 --> 41:27.207
We both know it.

41:27.209 --> 41:30.277
Everything I touch,
everyone I meet...

41:30.279 --> 41:31.378
Could ruin my future.

41:31.380 --> 41:33.380
You'd best kill yourself.

41:33.382 --> 41:35.849
I'm glad we both agree.

41:37.018 --> 41:39.753
Helen, suicide?

41:40.756 --> 41:43.390
You're so melodramatic.

41:43.392 --> 41:44.224
Do you have a better idea?

41:44.226 --> 41:45.959
I'm trapped here,

41:45.961 --> 41:47.227
and I have no way home.

41:47.229 --> 41:49.329
You can always go home.

41:49.331 --> 41:51.932
It just might take
a little while.

41:53.501 --> 41:54.768
It's one of the benefits

41:54.770 --> 41:56.837
of your incredibly
slow aging.

41:56.839 --> 41:58.972
Disappear.

41:58.974 --> 42:01.441
Go somewhere... remote,

42:01.443 --> 42:03.410
with limited contact
with the rest of world.

42:03.412 --> 42:05.912
Spend the time thinking about...

42:05.914 --> 42:07.381
All the things
you've lived through.

42:07.383 --> 42:10.250
113 years of seclusion?

42:10.252 --> 42:14.221
Then you re-join your timeline
just after you've left it.

42:14.223 --> 42:15.255
Unless, of course,

42:15.257 --> 42:17.824
you're determined
to do yourself in.

42:17.826 --> 42:18.959
A vacation?

42:18.961 --> 42:21.862
From what I gather, you've...

42:21.864 --> 42:23.330
rather earned one.
