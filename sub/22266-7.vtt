00:02.294 --> 00:03.830
OLIVER: <i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

00:03.921 --> 00:07.631
Last night, a group of vigilantes
saved hundreds of lives.

00:07.799 --> 00:11.258
So if we are going to decide
on diverting police resources

00:11.345 --> 00:12.426
towards stopping them,

00:12.513 --> 00:15.677
we are not going to do that until
the people of Star City have spoken.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.218
<i>How the public will decide</i>

00:17.309 --> 00:20.052
<i>on the issue of vigilantism
is anyone's guess.</i>

00:20.145 --> 00:22.353
Mayor Queen didn't mention
he was under investigation.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.431
- Of course he did.
- Which makes us overdue for a chat.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.980
- I'm not the man you think I am.
- No, Mr. Queen, I think you are.

00:28.278 --> 00:31.487
I was able to upload
a critical piece of code

00:32.198 --> 00:34.156
- to Arclight.
- What happens now?

00:34.493 --> 00:35.609
We take the next step.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.703
OLIVER: Thanks very much, guys.
WILLIAM: Thank you.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.788
That's very generous of you.
Thank you, buddy.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.793
- All right.
- Oh, cranberry sauce.

00:49.883 --> 00:53.547
- Okay. Happy Thanksgiving, guys.
- Awesome. Happy Thanksgiving.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.253
Nice turnout. You're having fun?

00:55.347 --> 00:57.088
Yeah. I'm really glad we're doing this.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.765
Me too, buddy, me too.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.098
Hey, how do you think Felicity's doing?

01:03.313 --> 01:05.349
Uh, you should go save her.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.559
Can you comment on speculation
Mayor Queen converted

01:09.653 --> 01:12.646
Councilwoman Pollard's bill
into a city-wide referendum

01:12.739 --> 01:15.857
as a distraction from speculation
that he's the Green Arrow?

01:15.951 --> 01:18.318
If I was dating the Green Arrow,
I think I would know.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.404
Besides, the Flash
is much more my type.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.368
Sam, she's a civilian,

01:22.457 --> 01:24.414
- just give her a little space, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.455
How is it that you don't put an arrow
into one of those people?

01:30.007 --> 01:32.499
- OLIVER: Hey.
- Oh, did Oliver save you?

01:32.593 --> 01:35.461
- He is heroic that way.
- She was doing just fine on her own.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.799
All right, listen, we're all set inside.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.471
Rene, he's a complete pain in the ass,

01:39.558 --> 01:40.969
but he's a very good advanceman.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.223
- Detective, what's the tally?
- Um, I got it all here.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.226
Good. Good. All right, listen,
everybody, please gather around.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.979
Gather around. Mayor Queen will be
making an announcement

01:50.068 --> 01:53.903
and then we will be touring the site
of the new SCPD headquarters.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.906
Thank you so much

01:57.701 --> 01:59.158
for being here today, guys.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.821
It means a ton to Felicity,

02:03.498 --> 02:05.205
to William, to myself, that

02:05.792 --> 02:07.829
we can all gather together as a city,

02:08.419 --> 02:10.707
and help our neediest neighbors
on Thanksgiving.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.623
Across these various food drives,
with your help,

02:14.092 --> 02:16.459
the SCPD has collected enough food

02:16.762 --> 02:19.004
to feed over 1,200 families.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.344
And it is why I am incredibly proud

02:22.559 --> 02:25.222
to be here today at
the unveiling of our new precinct.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.516
A top-of-the-line facility

02:28.190 --> 02:29.726
for a top-of-the-line police force.

02:33.236 --> 02:36.445
One that might actually make
federal agencies jealous.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.654
Are you here
to tour our new headquarters?

02:40.911 --> 02:42.072
Turn around.

02:42.788 --> 02:45.747
- You're doing this here?
- Oliver Queen, you're under arrest.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.164
On what charges?

02:47.334 --> 02:49.997
Murder, assault,
burglary, and kidnapping.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.917
All stemming from your activity
as the Green Arrow.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.381
Dad?

02:56.760 --> 02:58.342
It's gonna be fine, buddy. I promise.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.923
WATSON:
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

03:00.013 --> 03:03.256
<i>Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.</i>

03:06.895 --> 03:09.182
Okay. The Mayor's about to
come in, press in tow.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.559
You'll give the formal salute,
he'll say a few words and...

03:13.151 --> 03:14.562
I want this man processed

03:14.653 --> 03:16.360
and I'm gonna need
an interrogation room.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.529
- This is the Mayor. You can't...
- I'm a Federal Agent,

03:18.615 --> 03:19.981
with a valid arrest warrant.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.907
I want this man bound over
until arraignment.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.531
- Yes, but you are federal. This is...
- Temporary holding request.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.578
I'm gonna need
the ranking lieutenant to sign off.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.874
- Then get him here.
- I'm the ranking lieutenant.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.002
Can I expect my prisoner
to be here when I come back for him?

03:34.131 --> 03:35.622
Could you process the Mayor
through booking, Joe?

03:36.758 --> 03:38.044
<i>Joe?</i>

04:03.410 --> 04:05.026
You did this in front of my son.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.575
In front of my son!

04:09.916 --> 04:14.081
Agent Watson, when I get out of here,
and I will,

04:14.880 --> 04:17.964
I'm going to sue you
for malicious prosecution.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.333
Express yourself. In the meantime,

04:20.427 --> 04:22.794
you're being prosecuted
for multiple felonies.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.338
You show up after five years

04:25.432 --> 04:27.173
and the hood just "happens to"
show up with you?

04:27.601 --> 04:28.967
That was Roy Harper.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.517
Wearing the hood at your instruction.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.355
Same way John Diggle's been doing
since I started my investigation.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.432
<i>I've got more than you think I have.</i>

04:37.027 --> 04:39.235
A confession will make this easier
on all of us.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.980
I'd like to see William.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.899
You're not in a position
to make demands.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.950
I demand to see William.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.530
Until then, you get nothing.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.964
You said you weren't
the Green Arrow anymore.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.092
I am not the Green Arrow anymore.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.341
Even the FBI would agree
with me there.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.173
I've kept my promise to you.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.257
You're in jail.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.435
I'll get out of here
as soon as I possibly can.

05:12.521 --> 05:16.811
For now, go home with Felicity
and Raisa will be there

05:16.900 --> 05:19.938
and I will be there just as soon as
I can. Okay? I just...

05:21.112 --> 05:24.401
I need you to be as strong
as I know you can be.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.282
Okay, buddy?

05:28.370 --> 05:29.451
Come here.

05:34.417 --> 05:38.001
Okay. This is gonna sting.
And by sting, I mean hurt really bad.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.624
Okay, well,
as long as it will stop this.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.546
Well, I can't say 100% that it will.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.625
This is a prototype that
Felicity and I have been developing

05:43.718 --> 05:45.380
to mass-produce her spinal implant.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.841
Spinal as in not sure
if it will work for your issue,

05:47.931 --> 05:50.344
prototype as in, well, prototype.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.470
Let's do this.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.182
(GRUNTS)

06:01.236 --> 06:02.977
Took Felicity's a while to work.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.232
Hey, you guys need to see this.

06:08.201 --> 06:12.036
Watson just arrested Oliver in front
of basically the entire world.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.239
FEMALE REPORTER:...<i>a lot
to be thankful for this holiday season.</i>

06:14.332 --> 06:17.666
<i>At the Thanksgiving food drive this
morning, the FBI arrested Mayor Queen...</i>

06:17.752 --> 06:19.914
- That son of a bitch.
- Pretty much. Yeah.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.629
Did she just do all this now

06:21.715 --> 06:23.251
because she just got through
talking to all of us?

06:24.342 --> 06:27.631
Sorry, she didn't talk to all of us,
she actually never talked to me.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.046
If you've got FOMO about being
interrogated, don't worry.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.598
Think you won't miss out
when we all get arrested.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.266
I actually think we're all
in the clear for now.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.593
No, because cops arrest

06:35.687 --> 06:36.768
up the food chain
in criminal enterprises,

06:36.855 --> 06:38.437
not to say that we're
criminal enterprises.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.480
They don't arrest
the kingpin and his underlings,

06:40.567 --> 06:42.604
they arrest the underlings first.

06:42.694 --> 06:43.855
That's how it works.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.278
I've seen every episode
of <i>The Closer</i>. Twice.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.277
Well, I'm a real life cop
and I observed Oliver's interrogation

06:49.367 --> 06:50.699
and it didn't sound like
we were targets.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.117
That's enough.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.487
We have to focus.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.782
This might be the most difficult
thing we've ever had to face.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.452
If the people think
that the Green Arrow's in prison,

07:00.545 --> 07:01.752
then the floodgates will open.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.418
Now, more than ever,
we have to protect this city.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.043
<i>If the criminals here think
that it's open season,</i>

07:08.637 --> 07:10.424
then this city will become a war zone.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.509
You got us in here so easily.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.560
I didn't have a chance
to kill anybody.

07:18.980 --> 07:22.098
Well, homicide is not
our objective here, Miss Lance.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.558
Two guards inside.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.939
<i>What's the holdup?</i>

07:27.113 --> 07:29.321
Your generation is so impatient.

07:29.532 --> 07:32.400
Why can't you just
savor the anticipation?

07:33.828 --> 07:37.367
Cry havoc and let slip
the dogs of war, Miss Lance.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.953
(GUARDS GRUNT)

07:43.046 --> 07:45.834
That was a literary epigram,
Miss Lance, not a directive.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.293
Potato, po-tah-toe.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.629
Now, what am I looking for?

07:49.719 --> 07:53.383
The nano-thermite device is inside
the containment unit at the far end.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.059
They do not have the keys.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.398
- Wait.
- Why?

08:04.776 --> 08:07.268
And don't say
"Savor the anticipation."

08:07.362 --> 08:10.400
Nano-thermite is highly explosive.
Your scream will detonate...

08:10.490 --> 08:11.606
(SCREAMS)

08:17.831 --> 08:21.495
You do see how that
could've gone wrong. Yes?

08:21.710 --> 08:23.042
Yes. But it didn't.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.980
- Tell me what you need.
- I need some sleep.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.190
I think I can do one better.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.905
<i>FBI transfers can get lost.</i>

08:57.454 --> 09:00.037
- Locks can be left open.
- I appreciate that.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.826
But if I make myself a fugitive,
then,

09:06.713 --> 09:08.500
obviously I'm making
William an orphan.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.382
- You got to do it the right way.
- Yeah.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.965
- I got to do it the right way.
- Okay.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.298
Good night.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.348
(SIGHS)

09:35.116 --> 09:36.607
Hand's feeling a bit better.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.610
What you got?

09:38.703 --> 09:40.865
There was a break-in last night
at Sunderland Corp.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.412
Why didn't we get an alert?

09:42.499 --> 09:43.535
Felicity has us wired...

09:43.625 --> 09:46.242
Up the wazoo. I know.
Trying to figure it out.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.669
We're basically
the Big Brother of Star City.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.750
Not in a creepy way.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.923
<i>Okay. This makes more sense now.</i>

09:57.305 --> 09:58.295
Laurel.

09:58.389 --> 10:00.096
Yeah, who works with Cayden James,

10:00.183 --> 10:03.472
who can hack any security system
to bypass any alerts, such as ours.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.551
What did they steal?

10:07.232 --> 10:10.646
Nano-thermite. It's a metastable
intermolecular composite.

10:11.402 --> 10:15.646
A reactive particle, you know,
like mint inside a soda?

10:15.865 --> 10:19.324
Alone, harmless. But together,
kaboom, as in kill lots of people,

10:19.577 --> 10:20.863
not spill grape juice
all over your clothes...

10:21.121 --> 10:22.237
What are they targeting, Curtis?

10:22.330 --> 10:23.696
I don't know.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.873
Nano-thermite needs to be combined
in order to be combustible,

10:25.959 --> 10:28.076
but once it is, there are
many, many, many possibilities.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.378
- Can you narrow it down?
- No. But Felicity might be able to.

10:33.508 --> 10:36.251
Hey, talk fast. Oliver's arraignment
is in two minutes.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.043
Laurel and Cayden James
got their hands on

10:38.138 --> 10:39.595
a mess of nano-thermite last night.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.092
That means they'll be in the market
for an accelerant.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.390
Yeah, what kind of accelerant?
That's a really long list.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.597
The nano-thermite heist,
did it involve a computer hack?

10:45.687 --> 10:48.054
It involved Cayden James,
so what do you think?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.605
I think that you can back-trace
his hack,

10:49.691 --> 10:50.807
maybe you can get into his system.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.890
Can you come back and do this?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.146
Because you're like,
way better at this than I am.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.226
I got to go.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.405
- Hey.
- MAN: <i>Mr. Mayor?</i>

11:01.077 --> 11:04.115
Sam? I didn't realize
you were joining my defense.

11:04.706 --> 11:07.824
- Can a city district attorney...
- He can't. And I'm not.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.743
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor. But considering
that the charges against you

11:10.837 --> 11:12.669
stem from actions taken
within this city...

11:12.839 --> 11:14.922
Is the FBI handing you the case?

11:16.259 --> 11:17.420
Sorry, Oliver.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.638
All rise!

11:24.767 --> 11:27.760
Docket Q-R-2-8-6-1,
<i>State vs Oliver Queen.</i>

11:27.854 --> 11:29.311
<i>Judge McGarvey presiding.</i>

11:34.194 --> 11:35.651
I understand the defense have waived

11:35.737 --> 11:37.524
the reading of charges
in favor of a motion?

11:37.697 --> 11:38.687
Yes, Your Honor.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.653
Defense moves to dismiss
for lack of probable cause.

11:42.285 --> 11:45.244
The photograph with the defendant
wearing the Green Arrow outfit

11:45.330 --> 11:46.616
was debunked a month ago.

taking initiative.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.825
Should we order
our traditional Thanksgiving meal?

24:14.912 --> 24:16.028
I can call Big Belly Burger.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.363
I'm gonna crush my french fries,
and pretend they're mashed potatoes.

24:20.876 --> 24:21.992
Got it.

24:22.086 --> 24:25.500
Maximum damage for a thermobaric bomb
is Starling Stadium.

24:25.589 --> 24:26.830
Today is Thanksgiving.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.836
Yeah. We just covered that
when we talked about

24:28.926 --> 24:30.383
ordering turkey burgers.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.464
I'm saying Billy Joel
is playing there tonight.

24:32.554 --> 24:33.761
Sold-out crowd.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.426
I happen to like
a wide variety of music

24:36.517 --> 24:40.352
and <i>The Stranger</i> is a treasured
piece of rock and roll history. Yeah.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.519
Starling Stadium seats 35,000 people.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.228
Guess that sold-out crowd's gonna
get pressure cooked today.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.063
So how do we go in without Diggle?

24:47.236 --> 24:49.193
We have to step it up.
Fight without him.

24:49.279 --> 24:50.986
Yeah, 'cause that went really well
at AmerTek.

24:51.281 --> 24:52.567
We got four hours until showtime.

24:52.658 --> 24:53.944
That's definitely the place,
because Cayden

24:54.034 --> 24:55.525
already has control over the system.

24:55.869 --> 24:58.202
What can we do about shutting it down
or cutting the power or something?

24:58.288 --> 24:59.449
Tried that, didn't work.

24:59.540 --> 25:00.997
That's how I know Cayden
has me locked out of the grid.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.575
I know the saying goes "The show
must go on," but this can't.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.205
I might be able to help with that.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.422
I'll declare a state of emergency
and they will cancel the concert.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.423
- Did you talk to John?
- John and I spoke.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.676
Wanted to apologize to everyone.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.342
I didn't know
about John's injury and...

25:18.809 --> 25:20.300
I should have.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.643
I will have them
shut down the concert.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.641
I wanted to see Billy Joel.

25:27.192 --> 25:30.401
Like I said on the phone, Mr. Mayor,
I'm not canceling.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.030
The cost would be catastrophic.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.066
So would a terrorist attack.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.696
You have no actionable intelligence

25:37.786 --> 25:39.778
or confirmation from law enforcement.

25:40.039 --> 25:43.077
You're asking me to set a match
to millions of dollars on a hunch?

25:43.292 --> 25:46.035
Have you even
brought this to Mr. Joel?

25:46.128 --> 25:47.369
Brought what?

25:47.671 --> 25:49.628
You haven't given me
anything substantive.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.456
I'm trying to save lives.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.416
You're trying to save your ass.

25:53.635 --> 25:56.469
You give me some proof, something
more than your gut to go on,

25:56.805 --> 26:00.970
and I'll cancel. But without it,
we open the gates at 7:00 p.m.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.303
Oh, come on.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.936
- You all right?
- Yeah. Why're you asking?

26:09.610 --> 26:11.192
- 'Cause you don't look it.
- Well...

26:11.278 --> 26:12.314
Well, I get it.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.361
No one wants to believe
someone that they care about

26:14.448 --> 26:16.690
is capable of unspeakable things.
I've been there.

26:17.534 --> 26:18.570
Oh, yeah?

26:20.079 --> 26:22.036
Has your daughter's
otherworldly doppelganger

26:22.122 --> 26:23.658
been on a murder spree lately, Dinah?

26:24.750 --> 26:26.116
Not exactly. No.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.210
But I did find out my ex-boyfriend
is a vigilante.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.504
What, the guy in the ski goggles?

26:32.007 --> 26:34.966
I never thought in a million years
that he had it in him.

26:36.345 --> 26:37.836
And ever since I found out,

26:38.722 --> 26:39.838
I've been trying to reconcile

26:39.932 --> 26:42.174
the man that I loved
with the monster he is now.

26:42.518 --> 26:43.929
(SIGHS) Um...

26:45.771 --> 26:46.852
I'm sorry.

26:50.901 --> 26:51.982
Um...

26:52.069 --> 26:53.981
Last month when

26:54.738 --> 26:57.856
Laurel attacked the bunker,
I had a chance to stop her.

26:59.326 --> 27:00.988
- What?
- Yeah.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.237
I had a gun on her,

27:05.290 --> 27:06.576
but I couldn't pull the trigger.

27:07.835 --> 27:09.451
<i>Not like I did on Lian Yu.</i>

27:10.170 --> 27:13.504
The point being all those people that
she's been killing you told me about,

27:17.511 --> 27:18.501
they're on me.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.800
That's not anywhere close to true.

27:22.391 --> 27:23.882
Why're you saying that?

27:26.645 --> 27:28.011
I'm hoping it.

27:30.399 --> 27:32.436
Because I had a chance to stop Vince

27:33.986 --> 27:35.477
and I let him go too.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.480
We're good people, Quentin.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.698
And we see the best
in the people we care about.

27:42.286 --> 27:46.030
And I, for one, am not ready
to believe that that's a bad thing.

27:54.590 --> 27:55.797
Come back for Round Two?

27:56.133 --> 27:57.465
No. No.

28:01.847 --> 28:02.837
Back to apologize.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.598
You said you put
my family in front of yours.

28:07.603 --> 28:08.684
You did.

28:08.896 --> 28:11.639
Then I asked you to put on the hood
to make things better with my son.

28:11.732 --> 28:12.768
And I...

28:15.527 --> 28:17.484
I didn't give
proper consideration to yours.

28:19.489 --> 28:20.855
I'm truly sorry.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.948
I was thinking about William today,
a lot,

28:31.043 --> 28:32.830
you getting arrested in front of him.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.165
- How's he doing?
- Oh, he's fine.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.629
He's a tough kid.

28:38.926 --> 28:40.462
But he is very grateful

28:41.386 --> 28:43.719
and thankful that
you are the Green Arrow,

28:45.015 --> 28:46.597
so I don't have to be.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.635
Don't know how much longer
I can keep doing that.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.636
Especially in the short term.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.391
You get your test results back?

28:54.191 --> 28:55.398
Yeah.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.739
The nerve damage
in my arm spread to my back,

29:04.284 --> 29:07.243
and because of the steroid use,
I caused permanent damage.

29:08.330 --> 29:10.447
If I continue out in the field,
I could end up paralyzed.

29:10.540 --> 29:11.826
John,

29:13.418 --> 29:15.660
I really wish you hadn't
have gone to these lengths for me.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.213
Well, now it's my turn
to apologize to you.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.921
I should have never said
that I was doing it for you.

29:25.514 --> 29:27.255
Remember last year,
when the Dominators

29:28.642 --> 29:30.679
put us into this
"alternate" Star City?

29:31.228 --> 29:32.969
Yeah. Kind of difficult to forget.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.183
We got to see what our

29:35.941 --> 29:37.273
perfect life would be.

29:41.071 --> 29:42.403
Mine was being the Green Arrow.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.948
So you asking me to take the mantle

29:47.202 --> 29:48.568
was not selfish,

29:49.913 --> 29:52.781
it was giving me the one thing in
the world that I never knew I wanted.

29:55.002 --> 29:55.992
Well...

29:58.255 --> 30:01.089
Felicity thinks that Cayden James
is going after Starling Stadium.

30:02.259 --> 30:04.216
It's gonna be 35,000 people
there tonight.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.136
- You're the Mayor. Shut it down.
- I tried.

30:09.016 --> 30:11.508
Getting arrested is not doing
a lot for my credibility.

30:13.437 --> 30:14.473
What're you gonna do?

30:17.566 --> 30:19.148
I've been working
on a probable location

30:19.234 --> 30:22.693
for Cayden's thermobaric bomb,
but Starling Stadium, it's massive.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.149
We'll have to split up.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.821
Still, who's gonna be calling
the plays out there?

30:25.907 --> 30:27.148
I vote Dinah.

30:27.326 --> 30:30.194
She has the least field experience
of the three of us. No offense.

30:30.287 --> 30:32.495
She has superpowers, tactical
training, and police experience.

30:32.581 --> 30:33.992
It's all right, Felicity.
It's all right.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.415
We just cannot have a repeat
of what happened at AmerTek.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.993
Anybody have any suggestions
on how we do that?

30:44.468 --> 30:46.084
I have a suggestion or two.

31:01.985 --> 31:03.317
Overwatch, we're on site.

31:11.495 --> 31:12.861
Any luck locating the bomb?

31:13.038 --> 31:14.154
I'm running a code to find

31:14.247 --> 31:16.079
the building's weakest
architectural joints,

31:16.166 --> 31:18.158
targets of opportunity. So, stand by.

31:18.251 --> 31:21.039
And I'm still trying to get into
the venue's security system,

31:21.254 --> 31:22.665
but Cayden has me frozen out.

Can't risk the SCPD

you'll be the first to know about it.

out these doors.

has Cayden James listed as his father

on his birth certificate, but he's
never been known to live with Cayden.

and was never found.

to do with the Green Arrow?

35:49.773 --> 35:50.934
Or any of us?

35:51.024 --> 35:53.732
We need to keep digging, because
even if we bear zero responsibility,

35:53.818 --> 35:55.434

Cayden James thinks we do.

36:08.583 --> 36:11.326
And of course, no one knows
that these cops aren't legit.

36:11.461 --> 36:13.703
Does anyone else find this timing
just a little bit too convenient, right?

36:13.797 --> 36:16.881
The whole city is voting on
the Anti-Vigilante Referendum today.

36:16.966 --> 36:19.128
Guess we know which way
Cayden James wants 'em to vote.

36:19.219 --> 36:21.757
He pulled us in to get those videos.
To sway the referendum.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.087
That's not all he did.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.385
The man has
a real thermobaric bomb now.

36:25.475 --> 36:26.886
Which he doesn't intend to use.

36:27.394 --> 36:29.260
At least not yet anyway.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.016
- Still sounds pretty dangerous.
- Yes, it does.

36:31.106 --> 36:33.143
But it's a problem for another day.
How's the polling going?

36:34.567 --> 36:35.557
It's gonna pass, boss.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.610
Let's prepare a statement.

36:39.948 --> 36:42.235
I'm right behind you.
Just need to finish up with Lance.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.238
You know, if the bomb had been real,

36:45.370 --> 36:46.781
we still would've stopped it
from going off.

36:46.871 --> 36:47.907
Yeah. I know.

36:47.997 --> 36:49.659
It's just good to have
Oliver back in the saddle.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.324
Yeah, that and...

36:52.585 --> 36:53.996
You and I knew
where Cayden was targeting

36:54.087 --> 36:56.079
because we worked
on the trace algorithm. Together.

36:56.381 --> 36:57.622
'Cause we're a good team.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.758
I'm sorry that I named the company
without consulting you.

37:01.845 --> 37:03.962
And I'm sorry
that I picked our first project.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.796
I'm sorry that I took the prototype
without asking you.

37:06.182 --> 37:09.766
So, there's just one more thing
that I'm also sorry about.

37:09.853 --> 37:11.060
What?

37:11.146 --> 37:12.887
You know the angel investment we got?

37:14.649 --> 37:15.639
What?

37:18.361 --> 37:19.727
Evening, everybody.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.276
I think we all would like
to applaud city officials

37:24.200 --> 37:26.988
for conducting today's vote
in such a professional manner.

37:27.245 --> 37:31.706
I believe in my heart that vigilantes

37:32.167 --> 37:35.160
have worked to make this city
a safer and better place.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.496
I also recognize as Mayor

37:39.841 --> 37:42.800
that it is my duty to honor
the will of the people.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.965
You have spoken today

37:46.931 --> 37:49.719
and demanded the harshest possible
penalties for anyone

37:50.226 --> 37:52.388
caught engaging in acts of vigilantism.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.892
Some people still believe
that includes me.

37:56.566 --> 37:58.307
But I remain confident that

37:58.651 --> 38:01.735
my innocence will be proven
and I will be exonerated at my trial.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.359
Thank you very much, everyone.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.191
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

38:07.285 --> 38:09.322
We would've won
had it not been for the video.

38:09.454 --> 38:10.570
You did great out there.

38:10.663 --> 38:12.120
I feel like
I just kicked myself in the teeth.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.073
Maybe it's because you didn't believe
a single word that you said.

38:16.085 --> 38:17.201
Give us a minute.

38:20.340 --> 38:21.751
I'm headed back to Washington.

38:21.841 --> 38:24.379
Something tells me you'll be back
in time to testify at my trial.

38:25.094 --> 38:27.336
The time of vigilantes
is coming to an end.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.638
Because how can you idolize someone

38:29.724 --> 38:31.681
hiding in the shadows
who won't show his face,

38:31.935 --> 38:34.598
who refuses to own up to
his shortcomings and culpability?

38:35.230 --> 38:36.596
That's not a hero.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.184
That's a coward.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.142
What does your boy think of you?

38:41.903 --> 38:43.019
Leave my son out of this.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.274
Doesn't matter what I do, Mr. Queen.

38:46.616 --> 38:47.606
It matters what you do.

38:54.249 --> 38:55.740
Are you okay, Mr. Diggle?

38:56.543 --> 38:58.500
Well, I'm happy as hell
to be getting out of here.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.459
- And it's John.
- OLIVER: <i>William.</i>

39:02.966 --> 39:04.047
It's Mr. Diggle.

39:04.801 --> 39:07.885
And you were the Green Arrow
for my dad. Right?

39:09.055 --> 39:10.091
That's right, William.

39:10.890 --> 39:13.553
But if you were here last night,

39:13.810 --> 39:14.891
who was at the stadium?

39:16.062 --> 39:18.054
The Green Arrow wasn't at the stadium
last night, buddy.

39:18.314 --> 39:20.431
Just... Just his team.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.141
Okay.

39:22.235 --> 39:24.192
Hey, man, let's go pull
the car around here for

39:24.529 --> 39:26.191
- "Mr. Diggle."
- All right.

39:33.746 --> 39:35.112
I'm sorry you had to step in.

39:36.457 --> 39:37.789
And I'm sorry
you had to lie to your son.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.575
I don't want to lie to him.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.919
But I can do it if it's temporary.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.623
If I'm just

39:46.885 --> 39:48.842
subbing in for the real Green Arrow.

39:50.138 --> 39:53.802
- What do you mean?
- I mean as soon as you're healed up,

39:55.268 --> 39:56.679
I want you to put that hood back on.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.015
Oliver, I like the way that sounds.

40:03.443 --> 40:05.480
- Makes two of us.
- (DOOR OPENS)

40:05.570 --> 40:08.779
- JOHN: I'm almost ready, Doc.
- Um, actually, I'm here for Mr. Queen.

40:08.865 --> 40:10.481
It's your sister.
Something's happened.

40:17.582 --> 40:18.663
Hi, Ollie.

40:28.426 --> 40:33.046
Well, that stuffing smells a whole
lot better than this cranberryjello.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.547
William made the stuffing.

40:34.974 --> 40:37.512
- The young man can cook.
- Yeah, just like his father.

40:37.685 --> 40:38.926
Raisa helped me a bit.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.474
Raisa? As in our Raisa?

40:41.689 --> 40:42.679
OLIVER: As in our Raisa.

40:43.066 --> 40:45.900
Yeah. I have a lot to catch you up on.

40:46.402 --> 40:47.438
Yeah.

40:47.737 --> 40:51.196
I will save you some stuffing for
later if you want, Auntie Thea.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.277
I would love that.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.950
How'd you make
such a miraculous recovery?

40:56.120 --> 40:57.656
Lazarus Pit water.

40:57.747 --> 40:58.908
She's kidding.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.285
For blast victims like Thea
in a minimally conscious state,

41:01.376 --> 41:02.662
the trick is just to find
the right drug to literally

41:02.752 --> 41:03.833
wake her brain up.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.913
In this case, a new form of Zolpidem.
It's not even on the market yet.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.167
So more like

41:08.675 --> 41:11.884
cutting-edge neuroscience
than, I don't know, a miracle.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.628
It seems pretty miraculous to me.

41:16.766 --> 41:17.847
I missed you very much.

41:19.352 --> 41:20.388
Hell of a Thanksgiving.

41:22.730 --> 41:24.062
I've never had more to be thankful for.

41:27.110 --> 41:28.851
Come here. You too.

41:59.976 --> 42:00.966
