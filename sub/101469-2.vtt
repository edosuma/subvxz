Look, I'm sorry.
It's just...

06:12.291 --> 06:15.583
the situation with
my husband is complex.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.500
After my first was born,
it got bad.

06:19.583 --> 06:21.542
I was really down,

06:21.625 --> 06:23.709
-you know?
-Post-natal, uh...

06:23.792 --> 06:26.458
Oh, no. No, it was him.

06:27.375 --> 06:29.208
Being with him.

06:29.291 --> 06:30.875
So, I was gonna leave.

06:30.959 --> 06:33.792
I had a plan to take her
and get out,

06:33.875 --> 06:36.083
and then I got pregnant again.

06:38.250 --> 06:40.583
And I just couldn't.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.875
So, after my second
was born, I spiraled.

06:43.959 --> 06:46.125
There was this whole
period where I got lost

06:46.208 --> 06:49.375
in booze and people and--

06:49.458 --> 06:52.041
My husband got the courts
involved. He's so...

06:52.125 --> 06:54.375
manipulative and clever,

06:54.458 --> 06:56.625
and he made it look like I--

07:00.667 --> 07:02.875
He has custody,

07:02.959 --> 07:04.959
so I don't sleep with people.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.542
I don't drink.

07:06.625 --> 07:10.333
I don't do anything that might
affect me seeing my girls.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.917
He's not here.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.166
He's not gonna find out.

07:19.291 --> 07:20.500
Promise?

07:22.500 --> 07:23.667
(chuckles)

07:27.083 --> 07:28.959
What is it these people believe?

07:29.041 --> 07:31.250
(laughs) Christianity.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.834
With a bit of--
Look, the ancient Celts

07:33.917 --> 07:36.375
believed Osea was
the soul of the world.

07:36.458 --> 07:39.542
So, when Charrington came here
for his great experiment,

07:39.625 --> 07:40.959
he needed belief.

07:41.041 --> 07:43.625
So Charrington became
the father of the island,

07:43.709 --> 07:45.875
the first in 2,000 years,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.458
and it worked.

07:48.542 --> 07:50.542
A society of criminals
and addicts lived

07:50.625 --> 07:53.375
in blissful, hippie harmony.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.542
When he died,
his son took over,

07:55.625 --> 07:58.959
and then his son after that,
and so on and so on...

07:59.041 --> 08:00.542
What, they passed it on?
Seriously?

08:00.625 --> 08:03.500
I mean, it's not like
he's a king or anything.

08:03.583 --> 08:04.959
They just kinda...

08:05.041 --> 08:06.834
I don't know,
they trust him.

08:06.917 --> 08:08.750
My granddad was stationed
here during the war.

08:08.834 --> 08:11.208
-You know it was
a military base?
-Jess: Right.

08:11.291 --> 08:14.291
He never talked about it, never.

08:14.375 --> 08:17.959
You asked him,
he would clam up
like he'd been at Belsen.

08:18.041 --> 08:21.333
I mean, don't you
find this all a bit
fucking weird? (laughs)

08:21.417 --> 08:22.458
(laughs) Yes,

08:22.542 --> 08:25.458
but so is Catholicism
and crystals

08:25.542 --> 08:28.083
and quantum physics,
but hey.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.583
Whatever gets you
through the day.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.083
I mean,
these are good people.

08:31.166 --> 08:32.667
They've always
been amazing to me,

08:32.750 --> 08:34.166
which is why it
freaks me out that

08:34.250 --> 08:36.250
they've discovered
I'm a whore.

08:36.332 --> 08:39.041
(chuckles) Don't say that.

08:39.125 --> 08:42.582
It happened.
You know, we both did it.

08:43.833 --> 08:46.917
-You can regret it--
-I don't.

08:48.125 --> 08:49.583
I don't regret it.

08:50.583 --> 08:51.917

the festival and...

10:32.333 --> 10:34.834

We're on our knees,

10:34.917 --> 10:37.208
but we won't put it
before that girl.

10:38.583 --> 10:41.333

10:41.417 --> 10:44.709
I wanted her to see that
she's not alone in feeling pain.

10:47.458 --> 10:50.166
So, what? You think we're...

10:50.709 --> 10:52.375
connected then? Why?

10:53.875 --> 10:55.083
'Cause I found her?

10:57.959 --> 11:00.208
Maybe you were
meant to find her.

11:03.166 --> 11:05.041
I don't believe in
stuff like that.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.875
No, you don't think you do, Sam.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.750

and secret things...

-and He knows what
is in the darkness.
-(cheering)

12:23.959 --> 12:25.500

was it not said...

12:25.583 --> 12:29.000

mountains with the dead!

12:31.625 --> 12:34.083

slaughtered by the sword.

12:34.166 --> 12:36.583
For oh God, was it not said...

12:36.667 --> 12:39.000
woe unto the inhabiters
of the Earth

12:39.083 --> 12:42.208
-...for the devil has
come down onto thee!
-(congregation cheering)

12:42.291 --> 12:44.750
Now, I want you to look at this
man that kneels before me.

12:44.834 --> 12:47.917

-See what he has lost!

-(crinkling paper)

30:52.458 --> 30:54.709
You said he was
an archaeologist.

30:55.917 --> 30:57.875
No, no, no.
That's just what they call him

30:57.959 --> 30:59.834
because he likes to
dig around in the past.

30:59.917 --> 31:02.667
-I think--
I think he's a doctor.
-A coroner!

31:02.750 --> 31:06.375
He was a coroner. He was
looking into my son's death.

31:06.458 --> 31:07.959
We never met him.

31:08.041 --> 31:10.000
And now he's living here.

31:10.083 --> 31:12.667
And Epona's dead the day
after trying to hang herself

31:12.750 --> 31:17.375
in the exact spot where
Nathan was-was-was found.

31:17.458 --> 31:20.375
They're connected.
And these fucking people

31:20.458 --> 31:22.125
-know about it, and they--
-W-w-what do you mean?

31:22.208 --> 31:23.834
Like-- like a serial thing?

31:23.917 --> 31:26.041
-No. No, something else.
-Some kind of serial...

31:26.125 --> 31:28.583
-What?
-Y-you talked of...

31:28.667 --> 31:30.500
sacrifice here.

31:30.583 --> 31:32.333
Sacrifice?

31:32.417 --> 31:34.625
-Sam, that was 2,000 years ago!
-Look at this place.

31:34.709 --> 31:36.750
Is there anything
fucking normal here?

31:36.834 --> 31:38.875
I found dead animals
all over this island.

31:38.959 --> 31:41.250
Who's doing that?
And there are
pictures down there

31:41.333 --> 31:43.458
hanging on the wall of
Jack the Ripper's victims.

31:43.542 --> 31:45.000

31:45.083 --> 31:47.000

just chased me!

31:47.083 --> 31:48.667

-Okay,

31:48.750 --> 31:51.709
-if this is all true,
then what do we do?
-We get off the island!

31:51.792 --> 31:55.125
-We find a phone,
we call the police now.
-Okay, how?

31:58.333 --> 32:00.000

-Yeah, no, I can't.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.166

-You mean across there? No,

32:03.250 --> 32:05.458

to the mainland.

32:05.542 --> 32:06.959
Tomo's boat...

32:07.041 --> 32:09.750
Oh, they said it was,
uh, broken.

32:09.834 --> 32:11.625

a little chat with you
about all this silliness.

32:23.834 --> 32:26.000
Mr. Martin:
Sam, let Mrs. Paffard
come out now, please.

32:26.083 --> 32:28.959
-She's not got to do
with any of this.

a drop of whiskey in there.

Oh, don't be
a fucking arsehole.

-Sam: Epona,

33:18.917 --> 33:20.542
are you alright?

33:20.625 --> 33:23.834
My neck's a bit sore,
but yeah. I'm okay.

33:23.917 --> 33:26.583
Epona, if there's something,
anything, going on

33:26.667 --> 33:28.333
here in this place
that scares you--

33:28.417 --> 33:31.458
-You don't have the right--
-Sam: I'm talking to Epona.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.000

people believe in?

33:35.083 --> 33:37.333
-We're Christians.
-Sam: Christians?

33:37.417 --> 33:40.000
What? And-and-and that wall
and the symbols? I mean...

Jack the bloody Ripper?

Charrington was Saucy Jack.

-Sam...

33:49.709 --> 33:52.834
Really? What, you think
this is fine? I was chased.

33:52.917 --> 33:54.875
They tried to kill me.

33:54.959 --> 33:57.166
Kill you?
I don't think kill you.

33:57.250 --> 33:59.959
They threw a chunk of metal

34:00.041 --> 34:01.375
at my skull!

34:01.458 --> 34:03.291

He said, "My child is dead."

Sam, yours isn't
the only tragedy remembered

35:21.583 --> 35:22.959
this time of year.

35:23.041 --> 35:25.792
Jason had a son,
Epona's brother.

35:25.875 --> 35:27.750
It was an accident
with a combine,

35:27.834 --> 35:30.500
Jason was operating.

35:30.583 --> 35:33.625
Around this time,
things really get bad for him.

35:33.709 --> 35:37.000

-Then why did he blame me?

35:37.083 --> 35:40.208
Sam, he blames everyone.

35:43.083 --> 35:45.625
No, something's going on.

Does that surprise you

35:48.542 --> 35:51.583
when you're saying
what you're saying
about this girl's father?

35:51.667 --> 35:54.500
Okay, it's not just this.
It's-it's not that. It's just--

35:56.834 --> 35:59.667

I saw something.

35:59.750 --> 36:01.375
It was bloody and violent.

36:01.458 --> 36:03.709
-Where did you see blood?

36:03.792 --> 36:05.417
-I had this dream.
-Sam...

-A fucking dream?!
-No! No, I know how that sounds.
It was so violent.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.500

-Alright, that's enough!

talk to me, okay?

happened here,

Look at me.

36:20.375 --> 36:23.208

you here on the island?
