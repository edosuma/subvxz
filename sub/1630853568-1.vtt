00:22.939 --> 00:26.109

When I came to this country, I came with nothing.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.194
I parked cars
while I went to school.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.613
And I learned English.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.992
I later worked as a carpenter
until I got myself into college.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.537
That's where Ingrid and I met.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.080
She was studying
interior design

00:39.164 --> 00:40.957
and I was studying
architecture.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.669
And one year later,
we were engaged.

00:47.756 --> 00:53.428


00:58.933 --> 01:00.393
We had very little money,

01:00.477 --> 01:02.479
so we got married
at a community center.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.397
Well, actually a bingo hall.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.738
We were so in love.

01:19.078 --> 01:21.831
Everyone pitched in
with something in the wedding.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.043
The local pastelería
baked the cake.

01:25.126 --> 01:28.338
My cousin, Junior,
bought me a tux.

01:28.421 --> 01:32.175
My Tío Walter
played with his band, Los Inmortales...

01:32.258 --> 01:34.552
until they had to kick us out
the next morning.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.390
When her father asked me
how I planned to support his daughter...

01:39.474 --> 01:41.559
I said, "I'm gonna
be an architect."

01:41.643 --> 01:44.813
And he said, "An architect?
You should have picked a rich wife."

01:51.945 --> 01:56.950
When Sofi was born,
I didn't know how I was gonna look after her...

01:57.033 --> 02:01.079
but I promised myself
she would never struggle the way we did.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.207
Are you gonna work all night?

02:04.290 --> 02:05.750
No. I'll be right there.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.212
Oh, I love what
you're doing with it.

02:10.922 --> 02:14.384
So, I built
our house on my own,

02:14.467 --> 02:16.219
and ten years later,

02:16.302 --> 02:18.012
we were the most
sought-after firm in Coral Gables.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.101
So, tell me,
if I did everything right...

02:24.769 --> 02:26.396
how the hell did I end up here?

02:26.479 --> 02:28.231
...committed to this marriage.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.442
-That's not fair.
It's just unfair that... -Billy. I understand.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.070
-...she would start
with that accusation. -I understand.

02:34.153 --> 02:36.573
-Oh. Sorry for the offense,
Your Honor. -I'm talking about our marriage

02:36.656 --> 02:37.907
and she thinks
it's some personal attack.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.742
How dare I question
His Majesty?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.411
-Guys, please.
-We're all just supporting characters...

02:41.494 --> 02:42.871
-in the Billy Herrera show.
-Billy and Ingrid...

02:42.954 --> 02:44.497
Let's stop accusing each other,
shall we?

02:44.581 --> 02:46.749
Let's try this exercise
instead.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.753
When you do this, I imagine Y.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.463
Again?

02:52.547 --> 02:54.257
It's very effective,
and I don't think we've done it in a while.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.343
-I can check in my calendar.
-All right. All right.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.054
When you don't answer
after I speak...

03:00.138 --> 03:03.766
I imagine that
you find me boring.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.311
And I don't wanna be
with someone that finds me boring.

03:06.394 --> 03:09.772
I wanna be with someone
that finds me interesting.

03:09.856 --> 03:13.318
Not some stubborn old man
who's stuck in a rut and takes me for granted.

03:13.401 --> 03:16.154
-You feel you're being taken
for granted? -Oh, yes.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.739
I feel taken for granted.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.616
When you call me a workaholic
and a stubborn old man,

03:19.699 --> 03:21.743
I imagine
that you take for granted

03:21.826 --> 03:24.787
everything that I've sacrificed
to get our family to this point in our life.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.999
Look, I never asked for much.

03:28.082 --> 03:31.878
We've been marching
to your beat for years, Guillermo Herrera.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.796
It's the same routine.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.133
Sitting, watching sports.
Watching the Fishing Channel.

03:37.216 --> 03:38.676
The Fishing Channel?

03:38.760 --> 03:41.804
He likes to guess the weight
and the price of the fish.

03:41.888 --> 03:42.972
I'm a fly fisherman.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.183
-It's an art form, okay?

03:45.266 --> 03:48.937
You watch it, you unwind,
you relax. I work very hard...

03:49.020 --> 03:50.813
For what?

03:50.897 --> 03:52.774
...and I felt like
you were judging me on the Fishing Channel thing!

03:52.857 --> 03:54.484
I didn't know
there was a whole channel.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.278
For what?
We have everything we need.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.821
Our daughters are grown

03:58.905 --> 04:02.951
and we should
be free to travel, to go to Greece.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.494
Again with Greece.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.913
It's a metaphor!
You won't venture outside your own bubble.

04:06.996 --> 04:09.624
Okay, look. I came
to this country with nothing.

04:09.707 --> 04:12.919
I slept
on my Tío Walter's floor. I parked cars.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.797
I became an architect,
I built my firm out of nothing.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.092
I sent my daughter, Sofi,
to the top law school in New York.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.718
She had absolutely nothing
to do with that.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.553
I supported my daughter,
Cora

04:22.637 --> 04:24.806
after she dropped out
of college, so please explain to me

04:24.889 --> 04:27.517
why is it every time
I come here, I am the bad guy?

04:27.600 --> 04:30.228
All right, look.
You both have been coming here for over a year, right?

04:30.311 --> 04:31.479
-Oh, yes.
-Oh, yeah.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.064
So, I'm gonna ask you
point-blank.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.566
Do you still want this marriage
to work or not?

04:36.776 --> 04:37.902
-I'm here.
-No.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.286
You're not gonna change, Billy.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.955
And I'm tired of trying.

04:56.337 --> 04:57.755
I'm tired too.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.927
Okay.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.722
Well, just because
your marriage has devolved into rancor and reprisal

05:05.805 --> 05:07.932
does not mean that
this divorce has to as well.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.101
Since these issues
are very fresh in your mind,

05:10.184 --> 05:13.062
you both need to gather
your entire family together

05:13.146 --> 05:16.149
and you tell them
without blaming one another.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.860
So, when do we wanna do this?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.863
We'll do it tonight.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.906
Absolutely not tonight.
My daughter is coming home from law school tonight.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.034
We can't lie to them.
They're gonna read us like a book.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.578
It's gonna be a little bit
of a harsh welcome-home party, don't you think?

05:28.661 --> 05:33.833
Either way,
you're not gonna protect them from the shock of this divorce.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.044
Thanks for the help.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.128
Great.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.672
We'll do it tonight.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.230
Huh?

05:56.314 --> 05:57.106
A bigger smile.

05:58.775 --> 06:02.487
So, you wouldn't consider
yourself a postmodern kinda guy?

06:02.570 --> 06:06.449
No. Postmodernism
has no regard for tradition.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.618
Neoclassic architecture,
on the other hand

06:08.701 --> 06:12.080
demands you that you respect
the lineage of what you're trying to recreate.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.957
So, I'm more neoclassical,
more traditional.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.294
Which is why you have
so many clients in Miami.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.004
Maybe so.

06:20.088 --> 06:23.216
I mean, Herrera Architects
alone brought Cuba to Coconut Grove.

06:23.299 --> 06:27.720
I think architecture
is a great way for us to connect to our culture,

06:27.804 --> 06:29.013
to our home.

06:37.271 --> 06:40.149
Will you excuse me?
I just realized I need to get home.

07:18.187 --> 07:19.522
-Sofi?
-Yes.

07:26.904 --> 07:27.989
Coral Gables?

07:28.072 --> 07:29.907
Yes. Home sweet home.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.090
Sofi?

07:46.174 --> 07:47.884
She's not here yet.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.761
Oh, good.
I was thinking, tonight? It's way too rushed.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.347
Perhaps we should take
a little bit more time with Doctor Saeger

07:53.431 --> 07:56.100
you know, so we can plan
how to break the news to the girls.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.768
Billy, it's time.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.270
It's too soon.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.397
Why can't we just, you know,
give her a warm welcome

08:01.480 --> 08:03.524
and then we'll break the news
in a few days.

08:03.608 --> 08:07.653
Because I need to get this
off my chest. And I'm not gonna lie to them.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.865
Where is my Sofi?

08:10.948 --> 08:12.742
Not here yet, Ma.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.411
She must have run out
when she smelled how many onions you're using.

08:15.494 --> 08:17.163
-Really?
-Let me get some oranges.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.999
I'm warning you,
do not take over my kitchen today, please.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.752
Oh, and one Vicks isn't enough?

08:22.835 --> 08:25.087
It kept your father alive
for decades.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.631
Yeah. Ma, it's my house.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.758
But Sofi deserves
a good welcome party.

08:28.841 --> 08:32.386
Sofi deserves
a small family dinner with Billy, Cora, and me.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.598
How can you say
that your mother is not a member of the family, huh?

08:35.681 --> 08:39.810
Chi Chi,
why don't you stay for dinner? You know you're my favorite.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.688
I'm not lending you any money.
Has he been gambling?

08:42.772 --> 08:44.482
Where's the graduate?

08:44.565 --> 08:47.068
Hola, Ingrid, Chi Chi.
What's cooking?

08:47.151 --> 08:49.612
I'm just trying
to fix the ropa vieja. She added too much onion.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.280
Oh, hey. It smell delicious.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.574
Tío Walter is here.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.701
Tío, why don't you
stay for dinner?

08:55.785 --> 08:56.827
I'd love that.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.708
One happy family.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.461
Please, just a moment.

09:07.546 --> 09:10.633
I don't care if you invite
the entire freaking neighborhood.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.635
We had an agreement.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.929
We had a plan.
So we're doing it tonight.

09:17.014 --> 09:20.351
Valentina loved
working with Cora and her designs.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.520
Gracias, Cora.

09:22.603 --> 09:23.521
Thank you.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.064
How much longer?

09:25.147 --> 09:26.649
Huan is almost done.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.110
She's been going on
about this dress for weeks now.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.820
We're dying to see it.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.572
Oh.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.323
She hasn't shown you
the design?

09:34.407 --> 09:37.743
No. She wanted to surprise us.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.829
You didn't show your parents
the sketches?

09:39.912 --> 09:41.998
God, no.
They would have freaked.

09:42.081 --> 09:45.334
Yeah, well, now
they're gonna freak on me.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.795
Just don't look my mom
in the eyes when she's yelling

09:47.878 --> 09:49.755
and it'll be over
before you know it.

09:50.840 --> 09:51.841
Ready.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.927
Okay. Well, how do you feel?

09:56.304 --> 09:57.430
Like a woman.

09:59.598 --> 10:01.475
Guess we're just gonna have
to let them freak.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.019
It's not even a dress.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.687
This was an unforgiveable
mistake.

10:04.770 --> 10:08.065
But I promise you,
this is not what Ophelia stands for.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.568
What part of "quinceañera gown"
did you not understand?

10:10.651 --> 10:14.196
Not every girl wants to grow up
to be a Disney princess.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.740
You have worked at this store
for one month

10:15.823 --> 10:17.491
and you already think
you're Stella McCartney.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.243
This is a quinceañera store.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.537
Yeah. Well, maybe it's time
you stop being so old-fashioned.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.582
Maybe it's time you found
another place to work.

10:24.665 --> 10:25.833
Already on it.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.128
I thought you'd be more
like your sister.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.298
That's my ringtone.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.425
Come on, Huan.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.518
Sof?

10:44.602 --> 10:45.728
Wrong daughter.

10:45.811 --> 10:46.812
Hey.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.397
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey, baby.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.861
What's up? Did Ophelia
like your designs?

10:53.944 --> 10:58.157
Not really. She decided
she wanted to go in a different direction.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.076
What kinda direction?

11:00.159 --> 11:01.952
One where I don't work there
anymore.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.162
-I quit.
-What?

11:03.245 --> 11:04.538
Wait, what?

11:04.622 --> 11:07.416
Mamita, you just started
a month ago.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.544
Okay, great. That's great.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.505
So what's next?
What's the plan?

11:12.588 --> 11:14.757
Well, I've made it pretty clear
that I don't wanna go to college.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.761
So, why can't
I use my college fund to start my own business?

11:18.844 --> 11:21.806
Here we go again.
The college fund is for college hence the word "college fund."

11:21.889 --> 11:23.349
I know, papi...

11:23.432 --> 11:25.351
No, you don't know, Cora.
I mean, I've said this before.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.603
My college fund was me
parking cars at 16.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.647
I'm not gonna pay for you
to cut in the front of the line.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.982
If you want something in life,
you have to earn it.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.692
That's the way it is,
that's the way life is.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.736
Still beating those drums,
eh, Billy?

11:35.820 --> 11:37.530
She needs to learn
how to follow through.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.115
And you know I'm right.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.951
In all these years, not once.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.457
Hello! Mami!

11:49.834 --> 11:52.128
Oh, my God.
We missed you so much.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.754
I missed you, mami.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.966
I'm so happy. Welcome.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.635
Thank you, Mom.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.728
Oh, my beautiful princess.

12:12.189 --> 12:13.315
Hey, cuz.

12:15.317 --> 12:16.402
Papi?

12:21.699 --> 12:22.658
Dad?

12:53.939 --> 12:55.274
Tell 'em.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.026
Right here,
right on top of my head.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.152
What?

13:00.529 --> 13:01.530
You lost me.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.781
Stop.

13:05.409 --> 13:06.410
No.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.833
Familia,
I hate to interrupt you,

13:12.917 --> 13:14.835
but I've got something
I'd like to say.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.713
Yes. There's something
that we wanna say, Ingrid and I.

13:24.094 --> 13:28.557
That we wanna propose a toast
to Sofia.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.018
Since the first moment
you started to speak,

13:31.101 --> 13:33.145
we knew that
you were an old soul.

13:33.229 --> 13:37.566
And that you were kind
and you were very self-aware and very disciplined.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.235
And that discipline
helped you

13:39.318 --> 13:41.403
not only in college,
but also on the tennis court.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.571
Yeah.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.074
And also at law school at NYU.

13:45.157 --> 13:50.996
That discipline also helped you
pass the bar in New York and pass the bar in Florida.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.415
And now you have
two competing job offers.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.334
We're gonna throw
the New York one away,

13:55.417 --> 13:58.420
and you're gonna come down
to Florida, and...

14:01.632 --> 14:03.467
Oh, Corita.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.594
My other darling.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.098
Since you were a little girl,
you always wanted to play dress-up and design dresses.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.933
Apparently
not quinceañera dresses...

14:11.016 --> 14:13.811
I guess, but dresses
that fit your style

14:13.894 --> 14:16.188
and your mood
on a particular day.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.527
That's very nice, okay.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.195
To Sofi and Cori.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.196
Cora.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.783
All right, great toast.
Okay, so I...

14:27.866 --> 14:29.451
I also have something to say.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.619
Of course.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.912
You all know me.

14:31.996 --> 14:35.457
I have no life.
All I do is work.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.877
I mean, 100-hour weeks,
weekends by my computer...

14:38.961 --> 14:41.589
but then there was this guy...

14:41.672 --> 14:45.092
and we spent long hours
together.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.803
We worked
on the same case and...

14:47.886 --> 14:48.887
Oh, hell with it.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.640
-I'm engaged.
-What?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.684
Oh, my...

14:53.767 --> 14:54.977
Congratulations.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.729
Thank you.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.272
Look, mami.

14:58.355 --> 15:01.650
It's beautiful, mi amor.
So fast.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.569
Look at it.
Isn't it beautiful?

15:03.652 --> 15:05.738
-What's happening?
-Guys, thank you!

15:05.821 --> 15:07.489
Oh.

15:07.573 --> 15:11.368
Oh, if only
my Luisito would be alive to see it. He was a saint.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.703
Yes, I know.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.788
Oh, my God.
This is gonna be so much fun.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.708
Okay, okay, okay.
One second. One second. One second.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.293
Just one second.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.253
Just one second.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.757
Who is he?

15:24.840 --> 15:26.300
Like, who is he?

15:26.383 --> 15:27.676
What does he do?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.136
When did you decide this?

15:29.762 --> 15:32.139
Who is he?

15:32.222 --> 15:33.932
His name is Adán.
He's from Mexico.

15:34.016 --> 15:38.020
And he's smart and he's sweet
and he listens

15:38.103 --> 15:41.857
and he's constantly trying
to surprise me, but he does this thing where he...

15:41.940 --> 15:44.526
he bites his lip every time
he's trying to hide something.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.028
And it's so cute.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.572
And he's opened my eyes
to so much.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.950
He's taken me camping
and surfing.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.327
I meditate.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.037
-He's even got me doing yoga.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.872
Yoga, camping, and surfing.

15:56.955 --> 15:59.750
So when I found out
that I was going to Mexico...

15:59.833 --> 16:02.002
I couldn't leave him behind.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.380
So... I proposed.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.631
You proposed?

16:05.714 --> 16:06.924
-Hold on.
-Exactly.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.427
-You proposed?
-Yes.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.595
You proposed to him?

16:11.679 --> 16:12.680
He didn't propose to you?

16:12.763 --> 16:13.681
Can you do that?

16:13.764 --> 16:15.057
-Of course.
-Yes.

16:15.140 --> 16:18.519
I mean, you can do that,
but does anyone do that?

16:18.602 --> 16:20.145
-She did.
-I did.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.189
-That's my girl.
-Wait... Okay.

16:22.272 --> 16:26.902
What about waiting
until you have achieved some of your career goals?

16:26.985 --> 16:29.029
Papi, I've already achieved
career goals.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.700
I'll always keep growing,
and he's who I wanna grow with.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.868
And I felt it the second
I met him.

16:34.952 --> 16:39.039
We shared an Uber one day
and we had the most incredible conversation

16:39.123 --> 16:41.583
but for some reason
we didn't exchange numbers.

16:41.667 --> 16:45.087
I don't know why,
and I almost always regretted it.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.590
But then a whole year later,
I run into him at work.

16:48.674 --> 16:52.928
It turns out that we worked
in the same building the entire time.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.930
-It's a sign.
-Yes.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.765
Yeah, it's a sign.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.643
Two weeks later our firms
partner up on the same class-action case...

16:59.727 --> 17:02.104
and we end up on the same team.

17:02.187 --> 17:05.733
I just looked at him
and I said to myself,

17:05.816 --> 17:08.152
"Oh, my God.
I'm gonna marry this man."

17:08.235 --> 17:09.445
And I am.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.029
-Kismet.
-It's kismet.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.615
-Well...
-How romantic.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.783
Very romantic.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.745
-He's from Mexico?
-Yes.

17:17.828 --> 17:18.954
And you're going to Mexico?

17:19.830 --> 17:20.831
Yes.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.625
Are you moving to Mexico?

17:23.709 --> 17:25.335
Papi. Yes.

17:33.927 --> 17:35.137
I need to get some air.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.972
-Papi, papi, come on.
-Billy.

17:37.055 --> 17:38.766
Papi.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.393
Now you know how Luisito felt
when you asked for Ingrid's hand.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.978
Oh, my God, mami.

17:43.061 --> 17:45.647
What a moment, mi amor.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.108
I have one more thing to say.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.151
What is it?

17:50.027 --> 17:51.028
Cora.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.988
Yes.

17:53.071 --> 17:54.865
Would you be my maid of honor?

17:54.948 --> 17:56.867
Yes. Of course. Yeah. I mean...

17:56.950 --> 17:58.452
-Yes?
-Of course.

18:01.955 --> 18:03.207
You two are so cute.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.666
-That's cute.
-Wait, what was that?

18:06.835 --> 18:07.920
Is that your dad's car?

18:08.462 --> 18:09.588
What?

18:09.671 --> 18:11.507
No, it's el Porschecito.
That's him.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.008
Another tantrum.

18:13.091 --> 18:15.344
Well, nobody's perfect, okay?

18:15.427 --> 18:16.470
I got this.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.721
He's gone insane.

18:17.805 --> 18:18.889
No, no, no. It's okay.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.224
Let him go.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.389
Really?

19:00.472 --> 19:04.059
I give you the biggest news
of my life, and you just pick up and leave?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.061
I went outside,
I got some air...

19:06.144 --> 19:08.230
and then the guys called.
I forgot I had a game...

19:08.313 --> 19:09.481
Okay, can we...

19:09.565 --> 19:12.234
...so I came to play this game.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.444
Look at this hand,
a beautiful hand. I'll go...

19:14.528 --> 19:15.737
Can we talk?

19:15.821 --> 19:19.533
Long live the bride!

19:19.616 --> 19:21.660
And you told them?

19:21.743 --> 19:25.080
I told them
you were going to Mexico and that I was gonna miss you.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.124
What do you mean, Mexico?

19:27.207 --> 19:28.417
-All right, Dad. Come on.
-México.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.127
Let's go home.
Adán's on his way.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.169
No, no.
We just started a game here. Have a seat.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.588
Oh, for the love of God.

19:32.671 --> 19:33.755
How much for your seat?

19:33.839 --> 19:36.258
50 dollars.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.676
Pay up.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.970
This will be interesting.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.179
Okay. Vaya.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.347
You wanted to play?

19:42.431 --> 19:44.099
Go!

19:49.187 --> 19:50.939
Yeah. Why Mexico?

19:51.023 --> 19:52.566
Dad.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.318
Julio Cesar Chavez was Mexican.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.861
And Maromero Paez is too.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.988
No Maromero Paez
is Chicano, not Mexican.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.198
Because there is a job
that matters to me there.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.909
And that's where Adán is from.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.452
That's why I'm going to Mexico.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.495
But you were gonna be
Florida's governor one day.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.706
What are you talking about?

20:07.789 --> 20:09.791
Talking about that you need
to grow up a little bit more before you get married.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.877
I'm concerned
you're gonna pass on all these opportunities

20:11.960 --> 20:13.211
because you got married
too early.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.755
Play!

20:14.838 --> 20:16.214
Tell me about it!

20:16.298 --> 20:19.009
Marriage is already hard.
Why make it harder?

20:19.092 --> 20:22.846
In my house we only allow
Cubans, Christians or Cohorts.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.557
Your daughters sound like
very lucky ladies.

20:25.641 --> 20:28.185
Dad, look at you and Mom.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.145
You got married young...

20:30.228 --> 20:32.940
and you started from nothing,
and now you get to enjoy it together.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.319
Pass! Now I'm playing against

20:37.402 --> 20:39.321
two enemies and a traitor.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.948
And you've spent
the whole game passing.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.659
You passed on four,
you passed on two.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.953
Here's the four/two!

20:46.036 --> 20:47.079
Now, can we go?

20:54.419 --> 20:55.629
Pleasure doing business.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.089
Let's go.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.091
Billy! One last game!

20:59.174 --> 21:00.592
She's the boss!

21:00.676 --> 21:01.677
Sofi!

21:02.344 --> 21:04.096
Sofi!

21:04.179 --> 21:06.139
He still has to ask me
for your hand in marriage.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.474
Ay, Dad.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.562
Hi, quelite.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.942
Way to dodge a bullet, big guy.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.860
Did I have a choice?

21:18.944 --> 21:21.822
Oh, we're supposed
to play the perfect family until Sofi gets married?

21:21.905 --> 21:23.824
Or we could say...

21:23.907 --> 21:26.410
"Sorry to spoil your happiness,
but we're getting a divorce. Mazel tov."

21:26.493 --> 21:28.036
Mami, papi...

21:29.037 --> 21:30.831
this is Adán Castillo.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.166
This is my mom, Ingrid Herrera.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.711
Mrs. Herrera, such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

21:35.794 --> 21:39.214
Please call me Ingrid
and give me a hug, mijo.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.637
And this is my dad,
Guillermo Herrera.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.015
Mr. Herrera,
such a pleasure, sir.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.224
Likewise.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.813
Sofi told me
you have a beautiful garden

21:54.896 --> 21:57.566
so this is my contribution
to the family tree.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.152
How thoughtful.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.821
You know what,
let's find a place where it's gonna be happy.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.031
-Okay.
-Follow me.

22:04.990 --> 22:05.949
So sweet.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.078
You are so sweet.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.163
I'm glad you liked it.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.165
I love it. Thank you.

22:13.248 --> 22:14.541
That was very thoughtful.

22:14.624 --> 22:17.169
Thank you, Guillermo.

22:17.252 --> 22:21.757
Wow, this house
has so much hearth, you know?

22:21.840 --> 22:22.924
Hearth?

22:23.008 --> 22:25.135
Yeah. It feels like a home.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.680
Good word.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.390
I built this house
when nobody would hire me

22:30.474 --> 22:33.310
so I hired myself
and I slowly built it into this.

22:35.062 --> 22:36.605
Wow.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.107
You're talking about the house,
he's talking about the home.

22:43.653 --> 22:46.114
He'll soften up.
He's just a little nervous.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.116
Yeah, so am I.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.328
Oh, look at the girls
when they were little. They were so perfect.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.455
Oh, my God.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.832
-Quelite, look at your hair.
-My babies.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.417
Oh. Stop, Mom.

22:57.501 --> 22:58.460
What?

22:58.543 --> 23:01.421
You love me way too much. God.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.964
What is that, "quelite"?

23:03.048 --> 23:05.050
-Yeah, I was wondering too.
What is it? -Oh, oh.

23:05.675 --> 23:07.052
Go.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.304
So when all the summer
associates would have lunch,

23:09.387 --> 23:13.809
Adán kept whipping out
this Tupperware full of these, like, weird vegetable stews.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.685
And, by the way,
he's an amazing cook.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.480
And all of us were like,
"Ew, what are you eating?"

23:18.563 --> 23:19.940
-You remember that?
-Yeah, yeah.

23:20.023 --> 23:21.316
And I said, "quelites."

23:21.399 --> 23:23.151
So they started calling me
quelite.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.986
But then Sofi tried them,
loved them

23:25.070 --> 23:27.531
-and I started
calling her quelite. -Me quelites.

23:27.614 --> 23:29.032
-Oh, that's so sweet.
-Get it?

23:29.116 --> 23:30.534
I love it. I love it.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.344
Well, I guess the stories
behind the nicknames

23:49.427 --> 23:51.596
are never as good
as the nicknames themselves.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.060
Would you like a drink?

23:57.144 --> 23:58.145
-No, thank you.
-I'm good.

23:58.228 --> 23:59.104
I'm okay.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.439
Come to my office.

24:02.941 --> 24:03.984
-Come on.
-Yeah.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.243
You're coming too?

24:14.995 --> 24:16.830
Are you implying we shouldn't?

24:18.498 --> 24:19.541
No, no.

24:26.464 --> 24:27.841
I feel like I'm in trouble.

24:27.924 --> 24:29.551
-Yeah.
-So,

24:29.634 --> 24:33.763
you said you found
a law firm in Mexico?

24:33.847 --> 24:35.015
Yes.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.683
International one?

24:36.766 --> 24:38.977
Yes. Well,
actually it's a non-profit.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.606
-A non-profit?
-Yeah.

24:42.689 --> 24:45.734
It gives aid to refugees
coming into the U.S. from Mexico.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.360
How is the money in that?

24:47.444 --> 24:50.238
Well, the money is decent.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.199
Decent?

24:52.282 --> 24:55.702
So, how do you propose
to support my daughter?

24:55.785 --> 24:57.537
Wait.

24:57.621 --> 25:01.917
He's not here to support me,
Dad. We're supporting each other.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.086
And we're not making decisions
based on money.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.631
I wish I didn't have
to make decisions based on money.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.760
Right.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.845
Anyway, Mr. Herrera,
I know I was supposed to ask for your blessing...

25:13.929 --> 25:15.138
before marrying
your daughter...

25:15.222 --> 25:16.264
Blessing. Permission.

25:16.348 --> 25:17.599
One of those.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.268
But she beat you to the punch.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.812
-Yeah. She gave me
a pretty good punch too. -Yep.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.940
-That I did.

25:25.023 --> 25:28.818
We start in September,
so things have been pretty crazy, as you can imagine.

25:28.902 --> 25:31.988
That's why
I didn't have a chance to come to Miami until now

25:32.072 --> 25:33.698
to tell you both personally

25:33.782 --> 25:37.661
that you have truly raised
the best daughter in the world.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.579
She inspires me every day
to be a better man.

25:39.663 --> 25:43.500
I wanna learn from her,
I wanna be like her...

25:44.542 --> 25:46.086
So nothing would make me
happier

25:46.169 --> 25:48.755
than to have your blessing
to marry your daughter, sir.

25:50.548 --> 25:51.549
Yeah.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.010
But a non-profit...

25:54.094 --> 25:55.136
-Billy!
-Papi!

26:00.308 --> 26:01.893
Of course you have my blessing.

26:10.318 --> 26:13.613
-Did you say you start working
in September? -Yeah.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.323
-That's in two months.
-Yep.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.284
When did you plan
on getting married?

26:17.367 --> 26:18.827
August.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.662
We wanna squeeze
in the honeymoon before going to Mexico.

26:20.745 --> 26:23.331
Of course.
But don't you think that's a little crazy?

26:23.415 --> 26:25.625
How are we gonna
pull together a wedding in one month?

26:25.709 --> 26:26.876
Yes, that's too rushed.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.586
Why don't you wait a year?
Or two.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.297
You know, get to know
each other a little bit.

26:30.380 --> 26:33.008
No. We want to start
our lives together.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.385
I understand,
but that's a bit tight.

26:35.468 --> 26:37.012
It's gonna drive up the cost.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.555
That's the least
of our worries.

26:38.638 --> 26:41.057
Well, papi, we don't want
some big, fancy wedding.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.642
We want something simple and...

26:42.726 --> 26:43.518
Intimate.

26:43.601 --> 26:44.561
And intimate.

26:44.644 --> 26:46.229
And we wanna pay for it.

26:46.313 --> 26:47.856
Two lawyers
who are out of college

26:47.939 --> 26:50.358
working for a non-profit
are gonna pay for the wedding.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.985
I'm the father of the bride,

26:52.068 --> 26:53.486
the father of the bride
will be paying for the wedding.

26:53.570 --> 26:54.946
If I could just
explain the situation...

26:55.030 --> 26:56.906
There's nothing to explain.

26:56.990 --> 26:59.159
I am the father of the bride,
and I will be paying for the wedding.

26:59.242 --> 27:01.578
And I'm gonna
be walking my daughter down the aisle.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.504
Sir, thank you so much
for a great night. You have an amazing daughter.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.089
-I'm a very lucky man.
-Yes, you are.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.132
Nine a.m.?

27:14.215 --> 27:15.675
-Bright and early.
-Perfect.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.218
I can't wait.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.178
-Let's go.
-Where do you think you're going?

27:18.803 --> 27:20.138
With Adán.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.599
No, no, no. I don't know.
Hey, hey, hey, hold on.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.392
I don't know what you guys do
in New York.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.394
Whatever you do in New York
stays in New York. In Miami...

27:26.478 --> 27:30.565
In Miami, in this century,
you can sleep with your fiancé, Billy.

27:30.648 --> 27:33.568
Good night.
Have a wonderful night.

27:33.651 --> 27:34.819
Thank you, Mom.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.446
Be well.

27:36.529 --> 27:38.239
-Adán, quickly flee
while you still can. -I love you, Dad.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.908
Go, go, go.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.409
-Come on.
-Are you sure your dad's fine with this?

27:41.493 --> 27:43.495
No, trust me.
Trust me.

27:43.578 --> 27:44.996
I know my dad.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.007
I don't see
what she sees in him...

27:56.091 --> 27:59.219
with his fake bohemian,
vegetarian soft voice.

27:59.302 --> 28:02.389
"I wanna learn from her.
I want to be like her."

28:02.472 --> 28:04.182
Seriously? Grow a pair.

28:04.265 --> 28:06.935
And, "We're not gonna
make our choices based on money"?

28:07.018 --> 28:08.978
You know what that means?
We're gonna be supporting them.

28:09.062 --> 28:11.648
Well, fortunately
you love to work hard.

28:11.731 --> 28:12.774
So money won't be an issue.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.859
She is gonna eat him alive.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.152
He's nothing like us.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.779
Maybe that's the point.

28:19.614 --> 28:20.657
Mm mm.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.160
Really?

28:24.244 --> 28:26.287
I need my space.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.289
You expect me
to sleep on the couch.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.250
Only until the wedding's over.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.127
Then you can get
your own place.

28:39.592 --> 28:41.094
Sweet dreams.

28:51.688 --> 28:52.689
Billy.

29:35.106 --> 29:36.274
What a day.

29:43.781 --> 29:45.700
Dad, where are you?

29:50.622 --> 29:51.789
Hello?

29:56.836 --> 29:58.755
Dad, where are you?

29:59.923 --> 30:01.174
He's probably hiding.

30:05.887 --> 30:06.930
Dad!

30:07.889 --> 30:10.391
Hey! Hey. Look at this.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.727
I had a rush of inspiration

30:12.810 --> 30:16.689
and I wanted to capture it
before it escaped me.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.400
How are you? Hi.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.860
-You good?
-Good.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.237
You're gonna wanna get changed.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.322
The wedding planner's here
in 20 minutes.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.783
Wedding planner?
What wedding planner?

30:26.866 --> 30:28.493
We didn't have
a wedding planner.

30:30.161 --> 30:32.080
Why do we need
a wedding planner?

30:32.163 --> 30:35.375
Because we have one month
to plan a wedding, and who's gonna do it? You?

30:35.458 --> 30:37.460
-You.
-Don't look at me.

30:37.544 --> 30:38.711
So, who is this person?

30:38.795 --> 30:40.213
Her name's Natalie Vance.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.215
She has a beautiful Instagram.
Very professional.

30:42.298 --> 30:43.967
And she is highly recommended.

30:44.050 --> 30:46.678
Natalie Vance
with a beautiful Instagram. Great credentials.

30:46.761 --> 30:48.429
She ever done a wedding?

30:48.513 --> 30:51.849
Well, she used to work
with Becky Weisz, so she's done many.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.185
Oh. Very impressed.
Coffee?

30:54.269 --> 30:56.604
I'm so sorry. Do you have tea
by any chance?

30:56.688 --> 30:57.730
Tea?

30:57.814 --> 30:59.440
-I'll get that.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.026
She's here.

31:05.822 --> 31:07.615
Hi. Is this
the Herrera residence?

31:07.699 --> 31:08.616
Herrera.

31:08.700 --> 31:09.701
Herrera residence?

31:13.204 --> 31:15.123
La familia.

31:16.165 --> 31:17.375
And the bride.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.294
Oh, my God,
you're literally gorgeous.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.838
And a lawyer? It's not fair.

31:21.921 --> 31:25.258
Thank you so much
for doing this. You are saving our lives.

31:25.341 --> 31:27.218
All right.
So, we have a month to secure a venue...

31:27.302 --> 31:29.596
catering, dresses,
send out invitations,

31:29.679 --> 31:31.306
make a registry,
and design a website.

31:31.389 --> 31:32.682
Ooh, refill.

31:34.392 --> 31:35.893
So, what are we thinking
about theme?

31:35.977 --> 31:38.104
-A theme?
-What do you mean, theme?

31:38.187 --> 31:40.148
-Theme?
-I didn't think about a theme.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.482
Okay.
What do we want?

31:41.566 --> 31:43.484
Big wedding? Small? Day? Night?

31:43.568 --> 31:44.569
-Night.
-Big.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.738
-Day.
-Small.

31:46.821 --> 31:51.034
We were thinking maybe
just like a small ceremony, very intimate.

31:51.117 --> 31:54.037
Maybe like a sunset ceremony
by the beach would be nice.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.246
Or at a barn.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.624
-Rustic.
-Like mason jars and burlap.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.584
A barn? A beach?

31:59.667 --> 32:02.086
Whatever happened to a priest
and a church?

32:02.170 --> 32:04.339
Yes. You know,
the wedding party.

32:04.422 --> 32:05.965
Your train down the aisle.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.717
-Tuxes. Ice sculptures.
-Gala.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.886
Just give me one second.

32:09.969 --> 32:11.971
We don't want
a Catholic wedding.

32:12.055 --> 32:14.098
What are you talking about,
you don't want to have a Catholic wedding?

32:14.182 --> 32:15.683
Who's gonna
officiate then?

32:15.767 --> 32:17.685
My guide Monica
from the Zen Center, New York.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.354
So, a yoga class
instead of a wedding?

32:19.437 --> 32:21.189
-Quiet.

32:21.272 --> 32:24.525
Okay, all this is lovely,
but we need to think of a theme.

32:24.609 --> 32:29.238
We were thinking, "Old Miami."
You know, tradish but fresh.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.782
-Kind of old school.
-New school.

32:30.865 --> 32:34.494
-Cigars.
-Old cars, like, Cuba, who is she?

32:34.577 --> 32:36.829
-Salsa. Salsa music.
-Salsa dancing.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.289
-Salsa verde.
-Salsa roja.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.332
Salsa...

32:39.415 --> 32:41.125
Picante.

32:41.209 --> 32:44.003
Don't you have some, like,
presentation or something to show us?

32:44.087 --> 32:45.630
Yes, papi.

32:45.713 --> 32:47.465
Kyler, Wi-Fi.

32:47.548 --> 32:49.133
TV. Thanks, girl.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.593
Yes, girl.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.178
Can't wait.

32:52.261 --> 32:56.808
Okay. First pitch.
Flamencos and flamingos.

32:56.891 --> 32:58.976
How are these two ideas
even related?

32:59.060 --> 33:00.353
-Well, it's a Latinks wedding.
-Latinx.

33:00.436 --> 33:02.522
A Latinx wedding in Miami.

33:02.605 --> 33:04.524
First of all,
I don't know what Latinx means.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.526
Second of all,
flamenco is from Spain,

33:06.609 --> 33:08.611
and they're from Mexico,
we're from Cuba

33:08.695 --> 33:11.114
so how do these ideas connect?

33:11.197 --> 33:12.407
Teachable moment.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.617
Thank you for holding me
accountable.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.452
This is the work.

33:16.536 --> 33:17.912
This is why we march.

33:17.995 --> 33:19.914
Kyler, skip the slide
about the queso fountains.

33:19.997 --> 33:23.376
The point is
that this is not cultural appropriation...

33:23.459 --> 33:24.585
rather cultural...

33:24.669 --> 33:26.587
-celebration. Right?
-Celebration.

33:26.671 --> 33:29.924
A celebration is fine,
but not a Broadway production.

33:30.007 --> 33:31.175
Do you have a business card?

33:31.259 --> 33:32.135
No.

33:32.218 --> 33:33.469
Where are your offices?

33:35.763 --> 33:37.432
I thought
you said she had experience.

33:37.515 --> 33:38.891
She came highly recommended.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.268
Okay, boomer.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.270
Sorry that I don't have
little businessman cards

33:42.353 --> 33:44.439
that pillage and plunder
our mother earth.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.274
You're from a different
generation, right?

33:46.357 --> 33:48.443
When you were born,
babies smoked cigarettes,

33:48.526 --> 33:49.944
and the milkman
delivered milk

33:50.027 --> 33:52.238
and, like, World War II
had just happened.

33:52.321 --> 33:54.615
But times have changed,
and there is nothing

33:54.699 --> 33:56.492
that I can't do
with this phone.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.161
The point is,
I'm not a wedding planner.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.164
I'm more
than a wedding planner.

34:01.247 --> 34:03.916
I get that you guys wanna
be a little different, right?

34:04.000 --> 34:07.253
Bohemian and kinda have,
like, Tulum vibes.

34:07.336 --> 34:09.589
While you wanna be
like a Tommy Bahama guy, right?

34:09.672 --> 34:12.633
You're like, smoking a Cuban
with your buddies and your clientele

34:12.717 --> 34:16.137
and just have this, like,
earthy billionaire-style wedding.

34:16.220 --> 34:17.805
I got you. Okay?

34:17.889 --> 34:20.141
My job is to be
your financial advisor,

34:20.224 --> 34:22.143
family therapist, and stylist.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.978
Your job is to enjoy the event.

34:24.061 --> 34:25.980
So give me a guest list
and a deposit.

34:28.357 --> 34:29.609
Do you have a layaway plan?

34:29.692 --> 34:31.986
"Layaway plan."

34:32.069 --> 34:34.947
I love dad jokes. So random.

34:35.031 --> 34:36.532
Okay. Let's forget the theme...

34:36.616 --> 34:38.993
and in the meantime,
let's go find us a venue.

34:39.076 --> 34:40.411
You want a venue?

34:41.245 --> 34:43.164
I got a phone too.

34:43.247 --> 34:44.290
Aquí.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.341
Thank you.

34:55.384 --> 34:57.386
Really? The Biltmore?

34:57.470 --> 34:59.138
Creature of habit, your father.

34:59.222 --> 35:00.681
I was
on the remodeling committee.

35:00.765 --> 35:03.017
We know, Dad.
You tell us every time we come.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.310
All right. Let's go.

35:04.393 --> 35:05.853
Good to see you.

35:05.937 --> 35:09.148
Hey! What do you think?
Look at this place. Amazing.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.608
Amazing. Look.

35:10.691 --> 35:13.027
-Hey, Colin.
-Mr. Herrera.

35:13.110 --> 35:15.029
Hi. Good to see you.

35:15.112 --> 35:18.407
Will you let Michelle know that
her favorite architect is here to see her?

35:18.491 --> 35:19.575
How are you? Good?

35:25.123 --> 35:27.208
So do you prefer
the green lentil

35:27.291 --> 35:29.126
or the butternut squash soup?

35:30.294 --> 35:31.462
Butternut squash.

35:31.546 --> 35:34.841
Delicious, huh?
Butternut squash, right?

35:38.761 --> 35:39.762
Okay.

35:41.055 --> 35:42.098
Here's the idea.

35:42.181 --> 35:43.599
We got an orchestra right here.

35:43.683 --> 35:44.851
Bang! Orchestra.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.020
Dance floor.

35:49.188 --> 35:50.982
And then we're over here,
family table.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.900
Family table. Long family.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.610
One set of tables here.

35:54.694 --> 35:58.114
Herreras. Castillos. Wedding.

35:58.197 --> 36:00.700
Biltmore. Splendor.

36:00.783 --> 36:02.743
Are you gonna have
Los Inmortales?

36:02.827 --> 36:05.079
Course we're gonna
have Inmortales.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.831
Tío Walter and the Inmortales
breaking out the classics. Everybody's happy.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.416
Wait, Dad.
You know I love Tío Walter,

36:08.499 --> 36:10.668
and no offense
to Los Inmortales...

36:10.751 --> 36:14.338
but there's not only Cubans
at this wedding, there's also Adán's family,

36:14.422 --> 36:16.924
our friends,
and we don't want an orchestra.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.759
We want a DJ.

36:18.843 --> 36:19.719
A DJ?

36:19.802 --> 36:21.262
Yeah, a DJ.

36:21.345 --> 36:25.016
And this room is too big
for 50 guests.

36:25.099 --> 36:27.393
Fifty guests? Try 50 cousins.

36:27.476 --> 36:29.770
Plus, we have friends,
my clients.

36:29.854 --> 36:33.274
Dad, I don't wanna get married
with 200 strangers I haven't seen in, what,

36:33.357 --> 36:34.442
ten years?

36:34.525 --> 36:35.943
Plus, I barely know
half your cousins.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.945
I barely know half my cousins.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.948
What better situation than to
reconnect with them at a family wedding?

36:41.032 --> 36:42.325
Let me just get one thing
straight.

36:42.408 --> 36:45.161
This is our wedding, Dad.

36:45.244 --> 36:47.288
Well, yes and no.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.664
Yes and no?

36:48.748 --> 36:50.333
Yes and no.

36:50.416 --> 36:51.876
Your name is on the invitation,
but my name is on the checks.

36:51.959 --> 36:54.629
Okay. So, because
your name's on the check,

36:54.712 --> 36:56.130
you get to call all the shots?

36:56.213 --> 36:58.299
Yes. Traditionally
that's the way it works.

36:58.382 --> 37:00.092

The one with the gold makes the rules.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.386
Sofi, please.
I just want to give you away

37:02.470 --> 37:04.805
in front of my community,
my friends. This is important to me.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.307
Did you just say,
"Give me away"?

37:06.390 --> 37:07.975
Dad, I'm not something
you could just sell off.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.310
Let's stop this, okay?

37:09.393 --> 37:10.686
I didn't come across
the Atlantic Ocean

37:10.770 --> 37:12.396
to sleep
on Tío Walter's floor

37:12.480 --> 37:13.856
-
-to put myself through school, to build the firm

37:13.940 --> 37:15.858
so I can afford something
like this...

37:15.942 --> 37:17.860
for you to stand there
and tell me I can't celebrate

37:17.944 --> 37:20.404
this extraordinary moment
with our family, our friends.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.615
Dad, Dad, Dad.
This is about us.

37:22.698 --> 37:24.408
Okay. I'm gonna interject.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.702
The other day, I was listening
to this incredible podcast

37:26.786 --> 37:29.080
with Drake talking
about the immigrant experience.

37:29.163 --> 37:30.957
-Did you guys hear this?
-No.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.209
Anyway, I know
that he is Canadian and you guys are Latinx...

37:33.292 --> 37:34.877
but it got me thinking
about immigrants.

37:34.961 --> 37:35.836
Exiles.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.505
Exiles. I'm so sorry.

37:37.588 --> 37:39.465
The point is,
it's always the same, right?

37:39.548 --> 37:41.676
The parents wanna preserve
their traditions and their kids don't.

37:41.759 --> 37:42.885
Tale as old as time.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.512
And I relate, you know.

37:44.595 --> 37:47.139
I wanted a Sex and the City
theme for my bat mitzvah

37:47.223 --> 37:48.432
and my parents wouldn't let me.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.850
I'm a Charlotte.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.602
I'm a Samantha.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.938
And you, missy, need to be
a little Carrie in this narrative

37:54.021 --> 37:58.192
while Mr. Big over here needs
to stop mansplaining how to throw a wedding.

37:58.275 --> 38:00.486
Okay, papi. Check it.

38:00.569 --> 38:02.488
It's a collab, right?

38:02.571 --> 38:04.949
You gotta be happy,
you gotta be happy. And we're gonna make it work.

38:05.032 --> 38:07.410
Deal? Let's go find
a wedding dress.

38:15.751 --> 38:18.379
Okay, guys,
the appointment is in 15 minutes.

38:21.590 --> 38:23.843
Am I paying for the dress
or the rent?

38:26.762 --> 38:28.014
Meringue...

38:28.097 --> 38:29.223
cake...

38:29.306 --> 38:30.850
boring...

38:30.933 --> 38:32.977
too bridal.

38:34.645 --> 38:35.730
Excuse me?

38:35.813 --> 38:38.357
Hi. What other designers
do you carry?

38:38.441 --> 38:40.901
I'm afraid we don't
have anything for you here.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.903
I think you might be
in the wrong store.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.655
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

38:46.323 --> 38:47.992
I'm just messing with ya.
I don't work here.

38:48.075 --> 38:50.327
My God,
I can't take you anywhere.

38:50.411 --> 38:52.371
Cora, this is Vanessa,
Adán's cousin.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.915
Also a very good friend of mine
from New York.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.543
-Hi.

38:57.626 --> 38:59.545
All right, fam,
here is the scoop.

38:59.628 --> 39:01.422
We won't have time
to customize a dress,

39:01.505 --> 39:03.632
so we're gonna have to
alter one that's off the rack.

39:03.716 --> 39:06.344
Daddy, what is the budget
that we're working with?

39:08.179 --> 39:09.180
Budget?

39:11.432 --> 39:12.683
Whatever she wants.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.602
I love that, that's beautiful

39:14.685 --> 39:15.978
but keep in mind that
you never wanna

39:16.062 --> 39:17.605
put a bride in a dress
she can't afford.

39:17.688 --> 39:22.610
So, prices usually range
from about here...

39:22.693 --> 39:23.694
to here.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.196
So, where do we land?

39:28.824 --> 39:30.242
Well, how about there?

39:31.160 --> 39:32.161
Okay.

39:36.207 --> 39:40.002
Get me Esé Azénabor,
Vera Wang, and Zuhair Marad.

39:41.504 --> 39:42.505
Fun.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.257
I mean, this just...

39:45.341 --> 39:47.802
This whole thing is just not...

39:47.885 --> 39:49.804
It's just not me.
It's not me.

39:49.887 --> 39:52.014
It's just so heavy.

39:52.098 --> 39:53.682
Try the Vera Wang.

39:53.766 --> 39:54.975
No.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.602
Plus, Dad would kill me.

39:56.685 --> 39:58.145
Please.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.897
You could ask for a fitting
with the Vera Wang herself

39:59.980 --> 40:01.232
and he would still cave.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.150
That's not true.

40:05.319 --> 40:06.821
What happened with Ophelia's?

40:08.572 --> 40:11.325
You know, I just don't think
I'm built to have a boss.

40:11.408 --> 40:15.162
So, I'm gonna start
my own thing.

40:15.246 --> 40:18.707
Don't you think you need
a little experience for that, Cora?

40:18.791 --> 40:21.210
Like what? College?

40:21.293 --> 40:24.004
Like college. Yes.

40:24.088 --> 40:27.258
You know, not everyone
has to follow the rules, Sof.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.386
Okay.

40:33.764 --> 40:36.851
Tía Pili could have made
her dress, you know.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.602
She made your dress.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.062
Yes, she did.

40:40.146 --> 40:43.357
And I looked like an extra
in a Pat Benatar video.

40:43.440 --> 40:46.443
And I looked
like a maître d' from Versailles.

40:46.527 --> 40:47.570
Yes, you did.

40:47.653 --> 40:50.156
-Here she comes.
-Oh.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.032
I can't wait!

40:52.116 --> 40:53.701
-I know, I know.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.452
-Okay, what happened?

40:55.536 --> 40:56.787
I don't know, I just wasn't...

40:56.871 --> 40:58.497
I wasn't feeling it.

40:58.581 --> 40:59.582
Now what?

41:00.749 --> 41:03.210
Y ahora, I was thinking that...

41:03.294 --> 41:04.295
Cora...

41:06.005 --> 41:07.715
why don't you make
my wedding dress?

41:07.798 --> 41:09.175
-What?

41:09.258 --> 41:10.926
-You're a designer?
-She's a very good designer.

41:11.010 --> 41:13.053
No. Not yet.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.638
You said you wanted a break.

41:14.722 --> 41:15.848
This is your break.

41:15.931 --> 41:18.100
Yeah, but I don't
have the money,

41:18.184 --> 41:20.436
I don't have the materials,
and we're running out of time.

41:20.519 --> 41:22.229
Yeah, see...

41:22.313 --> 41:23.814
You know.

41:23.898 --> 41:25.274
Isn't it
a little bit of pressure with the time we have

41:25.357 --> 41:26.525
for her to do
all these dresses?

41:26.609 --> 41:27.860
I'll tell you what...

41:27.943 --> 41:29.820
instead of being, like,
here, you know...

41:29.904 --> 41:31.322
we can be, like, here.

41:31.405 --> 41:34.491
Well, let's give all that
to Cora.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.577
-Yes!
-Yes. Cora!

41:36.660 --> 41:38.162
Do my bridesmaids' dresses
as well.

41:38.787 --> 41:39.747
Oh, no.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.999
That's five plus one. That's...

41:42.082 --> 41:43.375
Six dresses.

41:44.376 --> 41:45.419
Piece of cake.

41:50.090 --> 41:51.926
-There goes your commission.

42:04.313 --> 42:05.856
What have I done?

42:35.970 --> 42:38.097
I come bearing wine
and bridesmaids.

42:39.265 --> 42:40.224
Oh.

42:41.308 --> 42:42.309
Hi.

42:49.358 --> 42:52.486
Hey, Justin, please take this
to the patio. Please. Thank you.

42:57.908 --> 42:59.827
Come in. It's open.

42:59.910 --> 43:00.953
Adán.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.289
Mr. Herrera.

43:03.372 --> 43:04.748
Welcome. Come in.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.083
We're watching the fight.

43:06.166 --> 43:07.334
How are you?

43:07.418 --> 43:08.377
Good, good, good.

43:08.460 --> 43:10.004
Did your parents come here too?

43:10.087 --> 43:11.797
No, no, no, they landed.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.716
I just wanted to come
real quick to talk to you about something

43:13.799 --> 43:15.759
-before they got here.
-Great, perfect. I wanna talk to you too.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.261
Let's have a drink.

43:17.344 --> 43:19.013
At- 00 a.m.?

43:19.096 --> 43:21.432
It's never too early to toast
Adán and Sofi.

43:23.684 --> 43:25.060
To Adán and Sofi.

43:25.144 --> 43:26.103
Salud.

43:30.733 --> 43:32.234
Sir, I just wanted
to get something off my chest.

43:32.318 --> 43:35.362
You know, I came
to this country with nothing.

43:35.446 --> 43:37.031
I worked hard,
I put myself through school,

43:37.114 --> 43:39.033
I built my own company,
and with that effort,

43:39.116 --> 43:41.452
I was able to build this house.

43:41.535 --> 43:43.162
And you, if you work very hard,

43:43.245 --> 43:45.706
one day, you will also be able
to build a house like this.

43:45.789 --> 43:48.417
And about that,
you know, I'm kind of in a...

43:48.500 --> 43:52.046
The thing is this,
that my daughter, Sofi...

43:52.129 --> 43:54.465
she's used
to a certain lifestyle.

43:54.548 --> 43:56.550
And, you know, and I know
you wanna make her happy.

43:56.634 --> 43:58.594
-Right? That's all you want.
-Yes, and I'm so happy

43:58.677 --> 44:00.846
-that you and I are talking
about it. -You have so much potential

44:00.929 --> 44:05.392
to do that.
But that non-profit situation is just not gonna cut it...

44:05.476 --> 44:07.770
because, at the end of the day,
we as men...

44:07.853 --> 44:10.981
we get judged by our ability
to provide.

44:11.065 --> 44:13.901
-And, you know, I...
-Because it's all about...

44:13.984 --> 44:17.029
Yeah, and I feel uncomfortable
having this conversation.

44:17.112 --> 44:19.573
-I don't really know how to say
it, but... -Hey, hey. Hey.

44:19.656 --> 44:21.992
Look at me.
There's no shame in it.

44:22.076 --> 44:23.369
If you ever need anything,

44:23.452 --> 44:24.912
-you come to me.
-Yeah.

44:24.995 --> 44:27.247
And you see, my father...

44:28.832 --> 44:29.500
Dude! Dude! What a cross!

44:31.085 --> 44:33.837
Get up you bum!

44:33.921 --> 44:35.756
You see that?
He ain't gettin' up.

44:37.299 --> 44:38.300
Poor guy.

44:40.177 --> 44:41.470
Poor guy?

44:41.553 --> 44:43.138
-Okay.
-I just feel sorry for someone...

44:43.222 --> 44:45.349
who has no choice
but to fight for money, you know?

44:45.432 --> 44:47.434
Would you like me
to change the channel?

44:47.518 --> 44:50.687
-No, no, no, sir,
this is your house. Please. -No, no, no.

44:50.771 --> 44:52.648
What sport would you prefer
to watch?

44:52.731 --> 44:54.483
I don't really watch sports.

44:54.566 --> 44:56.235
-You don't watch sports?
-No.

44:56.318 --> 44:57.694
You play sports?

44:57.778 --> 44:58.862
I like hiking.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.447
Hiking's not a sport.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.116
Your father never taught you
any sports?

45:02.199 --> 45:03.367
He never took you to any games?

45:03.450 --> 45:05.285
No, he did.
He has a soccer team

45:05.369 --> 45:07.246
and we had to go watch 'em
play every week until I got tired of it.

45:07.329 --> 45:08.372
Hello, men.

45:10.791 --> 45:12.668
-Adán, your parents
will be here soon, right? -"Has a soccer team"?

45:12.751 --> 45:14.837
-Yeah.
-I need to warm up the fricassee.

45:14.920 --> 45:16.463
Let me help you.

45:16.547 --> 45:17.464
What's up with that glass jaw?

45:17.548 --> 45:18.465
I know.

45:19.007 --> 45:19.883
He's out.

45:19.967 --> 45:21.051
He got him right in the bun.

45:21.135 --> 45:22.761
-Yeah.

45:22.845 --> 45:24.513
-Yep, that's them.
Let me go get 'em. -They're here?

45:24.596 --> 45:26.140
They're here.

45:26.223 --> 45:27.850
-Adán, wait. I gotta
ask you a question. -Are you coming?

45:30.769 --> 45:32.104
-Let's go.
-Hey.

45:33.063 --> 45:35.315
What did you do to your hair?

45:35.399 --> 45:39.153
In case you hadn't realized,
our daughter's getting married in two weeks.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.116
You look very nice.

45:44.199 --> 45:45.159
Mm.

45:46.452 --> 45:49.163
Nice of you to notice,
Guillermo. Come on.

45:50.706 --> 45:51.832
Hernán.

45:51.915 --> 45:53.167
Behave.

45:56.044 --> 45:58.255
Hey!

45:58.338 --> 46:02.509
Mr. Herrera, this is my father,
Hernán Castillo.

46:02.593 --> 46:08.682
Give me a hug, in-law!

46:08.765 --> 46:10.559
A moment ago we were nothing.

46:10.642 --> 46:12.936
...and now we're family.

46:14.897 --> 46:15.981
That's true.

46:16.064 --> 46:17.524
-Ingrid, right?
-Yes!

46:17.608 --> 46:20.444
You're just as beautiful
as your daughter.

46:20.527 --> 46:21.487
Oh.

46:25.532 --> 46:26.533
-Hi.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.160
Hi, I'm Julieta,
nice to meet you.

46:28.243 --> 46:30.454
Hi, Julieta, hi.
You must be Adán's sister.

46:30.537 --> 46:31.788
Guillermo Herrera.

46:31.872 --> 46:32.831
Well...

46:32.915 --> 46:34.958
I'm actually Hernán's wife.

46:35.042 --> 46:36.251
Nice to meet you.

46:41.089 --> 46:43.217
And actually...

46:43.300 --> 46:46.178
this is my mother, Marcela.

46:46.261 --> 46:48.347
The former Mrs. Castillo.

46:49.932 --> 46:51.099
I'm gonna show you something.

46:51.183 --> 46:53.602
This is little Hernáncito.

46:53.685 --> 46:55.103
-Look at how cute he...
-Adorable.

46:55.187 --> 46:57.773
This is Adán's baby brother.
How cute is he.

46:57.856 --> 46:59.441
I wanna show you something.

46:59.525 --> 47:00.943
You're not gonna believe it.

47:01.026 --> 47:02.236
You're not.

47:02.319 --> 47:03.737
I'm gonna show you.

47:03.820 --> 47:05.280
-Just wait, wait, wait.
-You better take the baby.

47:05.364 --> 47:07.241
-You take the baby. Yeah.
-I'm gonna show you.

47:07.324 --> 47:10.285
I got his birthday tattooed.

47:11.495 --> 47:12.579
Beautiful.

47:12.663 --> 47:14.039
-Beautiful.
-Lovely.

47:14.122 --> 47:16.083
And I'm gonna put yours
and your brother's, okay?

47:16.166 --> 47:17.668
Ingrid.

47:17.751 --> 47:18.752
-Show me your beautiful home,
please. -Absolutely.

47:18.835 --> 47:19.836
-Come on.
-Yes.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.088
-Yes.
-Thank you, sweetie.

47:23.090 --> 47:25.133
How was your trip? Was it good?

47:25.217 --> 47:27.094
Good drinks.
You know, champagne...

47:27.177 --> 47:28.095
Yeah.

47:28.178 --> 47:29.555
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

47:30.764 --> 47:32.558
Does he own a soccer team?

47:32.641 --> 47:34.351
Yeah.

47:34.434 --> 47:37.771
Don't you have to be
a multi-millionaire to own a soccer team?

47:37.855 --> 47:39.982
You know how in Mexico,
there's two beer companies?

47:40.065 --> 47:41.149
I'm aware.

47:41.233 --> 47:42.609
He owns one of them.

47:44.736 --> 47:46.280
When were you gonna tell me
this?

47:46.363 --> 47:47.739
Oh, I tried.

47:47.823 --> 47:49.575
But you didn't let us speak.

47:58.292 --> 48:00.085
-Working pro bono, huh?
-Oh, boy.

48:00.168 --> 48:02.462
If I had a private plane,
I'd be making houses for the homeless.

48:02.546 --> 48:05.465
You know what's gonna happen?
Our grandson's gonna grow up to be a brat.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.343
Because of course,
she's gonna have a boy.

48:08.427 --> 48:09.845
You know what I mean.

48:09.928 --> 48:11.346
I just hope that Sofi
finally wakes up after this

48:11.430 --> 48:13.765
before Adán trades her
in for a new model

48:13.849 --> 48:16.560
you know, like father,
like son, the Castillo tradition.

48:16.643 --> 48:18.770
Look at the age
on this poor girl.

48:18.854 --> 48:21.982
-That's not gonna happen.

48:22.065 --> 48:25.736
You know, I heard from Sofi
that Hernán took his grandfather's brewery

48:25.819 --> 48:27.696
and made it into
the biggest one in Mexico.

48:27.779 --> 48:30.782
So it's not like
he didn't do something to get here.

48:32.909 --> 48:34.244
Sofi told you this?

48:34.328 --> 48:35.662
Yes.

48:35.746 --> 48:38.206
You know, she's not just
daddy's little girl, right?

48:41.793 --> 48:44.296
Showtime, baby. Come on.

48:49.176 --> 48:50.886
-Thank you.

48:50.969 --> 48:54.097
Oh, uh.
Sir, I'm allergic to shrimp.

48:54.181 --> 48:56.516
-Then let's get that away
from her. Billy. -Please, sir.

48:56.600 --> 48:57.601
Excuse me?

48:59.186 --> 49:00.562
How did you two meet?

49:00.646 --> 49:03.523
I was his healer. Yeah.

49:03.607 --> 49:05.442

So that's what they call them...

49:06.777 --> 49:08.612
Ladies, please.

49:08.695 --> 49:10.405

How are the wedding arrangements going?

49:10.489 --> 49:11.615
Have you found a church?

49:11.698 --> 49:13.450
Yeah, well, about that...

49:13.533 --> 49:15.035
No, no, they don't want
a Catholic wedding.

49:15.118 --> 49:16.536
-No?
-No.

49:16.620 --> 49:19.373
I'm sorry, I'm just curious,
but do you speak Spanish?

49:19.456 --> 49:21.583
Of course we do.

49:21.667 --> 49:23.960
So why are we speaking English?

49:24.044 --> 49:26.421
Well, because we're
in the United States.

49:26.505 --> 49:29.132
We got here very young
and we had to learn English.

49:29.216 --> 49:34.763
We spoke Spanish at home.
But everyone spoke English at school and the streets,

49:34.846 --> 49:38.392
so it was hard
to preserve it.

49:38.475 --> 49:39.935
Of course.

49:40.018 --> 49:43.605
Oh, my God!
I need to burp the baby.

49:43.689 --> 49:46.858

She has been like that since she become a mom.

49:46.942 --> 49:48.777
-The death of the maiden.
-Exactly.

49:48.860 --> 49:50.237
Time to get a new toy.

49:50.320 --> 49:51.488
Okay.

49:51.571 --> 49:53.824
Where do you want
to hold the reception?

49:53.907 --> 49:57.160
Well, actually, we haven't
found a place yet.

49:57.244 --> 49:59.621
We're looking
for something special.

49:59.705 --> 50:01.498
Well, actually,
we have found something special.

50:01.581 --> 50:03.375
It's called
the Biltmore Hotel...

50:03.458 --> 50:05.210
and it's the place that
I was on the remodeling committee.

50:05.293 --> 50:07.796
But apparently my daughter
doesn't find it unique enough.

50:07.879 --> 50:09.089
Dad...

50:09.172 --> 50:11.842
No, I mean, we were married
in a bingo hall.

50:11.925 --> 50:14.761
But my daughter, I guess,
has now become bored with the Biltmore.

50:14.845 --> 50:16.304
Dad, I'm not...

50:16.388 --> 50:18.849
I'm not bored by the Biltmore.

50:18.932 --> 50:21.935
It's just that
it's a little too fancy for us...

50:22.018 --> 50:23.812
and like we've said before,

50:23.895 --> 50:26.106
we want something smaller and,

50:26.189 --> 50:28.108
-And intimate.
-and intimate.

50:28.191 --> 50:30.736
Maybe, like, by the ocean,
or here.

50:30.819 --> 50:32.487
-Yes.
-Sofi, no.

50:32.571 --> 50:34.156
That would never work.

50:34.239 --> 50:35.949
This house is way too small.

50:36.032 --> 50:37.451
-Small?
-Pa.

50:37.534 --> 50:40.162
Well, I wouldn't really
consider this house small.

50:40.245 --> 50:42.038
I don't mean small
like "small."

50:42.122 --> 50:44.875
I mean small like,
my guest list alone is five hundred people.

50:44.958 --> 50:46.626
-Five hundred?
-And we haven't...

50:46.710 --> 50:50.297
even counted your mother's
and stepmother's guests, you know.

50:50.380 --> 50:51.840
Pa, this is our wedding

50:51.923 --> 50:55.469
and you have to be respectful
of our choices. Right?

50:55.552 --> 50:58.680
These kids.
They spend four years in America

50:58.764 --> 51:00.557
and suddenly they are gringos.

51:00.640 --> 51:01.975
What do you expect, mijo?

51:02.058 --> 51:04.978
That I'm gonna be a guest
at my own son's wedding?

51:05.061 --> 51:06.313
Yes.

51:06.396 --> 51:07.522
I think five hundred guests
is a bit much.

51:07.606 --> 51:08.982
-Don't you think?
-Yeah, it's big.

51:09.065 --> 51:11.276
You should see
the weddings in México.

51:11.359 --> 51:12.986
Amazing.

51:13.069 --> 51:15.781
Yeah, well,
we're not in México. We're here in Miami...

51:15.864 --> 51:17.324
and the costs here
are much different.

51:17.407 --> 51:19.409
Don't worry about the money,
consuegro.

51:19.493 --> 51:21.495
How many guests
were you thinking?

51:21.578 --> 51:23.955
I'll cover the rest.

51:24.039 --> 51:25.332
-You'll cover the rest?
-Yes.

51:25.415 --> 51:27.042
-Breathe.

51:27.125 --> 51:28.668
I don't want to burden you
with my needs.

51:28.752 --> 51:31.379
Well, no, okay, and I'm sorry,
I appreciate the gesture

51:31.463 --> 51:33.006
but I am
the father of the bride

51:33.089 --> 51:34.883
and the father of the bride
pays for the wedding.

51:34.966 --> 51:37.135
I don't care
about those old traditions.

51:37.219 --> 51:39.471
Yes, but I do care
about those old traditions

51:39.554 --> 51:42.349
and that's the way
it's going to be done, thank you.

51:44.601 --> 51:45.894
Fine.

51:45.977 --> 51:49.314
But then, let me throw
a little engagement party

51:49.397 --> 51:50.857
for the families to meet.

51:50.941 --> 51:52.192
I have a boat here,
in the marina.

51:52.275 --> 51:54.694
-We can do it here.
-Sounds fantastic.

51:54.778 --> 51:56.071
-Perfect.
-Thank you, Hernán.

51:56.154 --> 51:57.364
-Thank you.
-For the wedding.

51:57.447 --> 51:58.365
-Yes.
-To the wedding.

51:58.448 --> 51:59.407
To the wedding.

51:59.491 --> 52:00.367
Cheers.

52:10.585 --> 52:13.505
Consuegro, I don't care
about the old traditions.

52:13.588 --> 52:15.465
I pay for the rest.
Come to my boat.

52:15.549 --> 52:17.133
We could all get tattoos.

52:17.217 --> 52:20.136
You know, at least
he's trying to be gracious and kind.

52:20.220 --> 52:22.556
And I'm not?
I invited 'em to the house, didn't I?

52:22.639 --> 52:23.974
What am I supposed to do?

52:24.057 --> 52:25.475
Take 'em skydiving?

52:25.559 --> 52:26.768
-Oh, boy.
-Anyway...

52:26.852 --> 52:28.228
we should go
over the ground rules,

52:28.311 --> 52:30.230
so nobody suspects
we're getting divorced.

52:31.314 --> 52:32.899
Good call.

52:32.983 --> 52:34.276
Can we hold hands?

52:35.235 --> 52:36.361
We can.

52:37.696 --> 52:38.864
Can we dance?

52:39.573 --> 52:41.116
If necessary.

52:43.159 --> 52:45.620
-How about a kiss?
-Absolutely not.

52:46.538 --> 52:47.581
No.

52:47.664 --> 52:48.748
So, what can we do?

52:48.832 --> 52:50.542
How about the usual?

52:50.625 --> 52:52.961
We get to the party
as a couple, we say hello to everybody,

52:53.044 --> 52:55.547
then you ignore me
for the rest of the party.

52:55.630 --> 52:57.507
No one will suspect a thing.

53:04.222 --> 53:07.267
Tío, this is an intimate party,
not a fishing trip.

53:07.350 --> 53:09.144
I want to make them ceviche.

53:10.228 --> 53:11.813
Oh, my God.

53:11.897 --> 53:13.607
How rich is this guy?

53:15.275 --> 53:16.610
That's his boat?

53:16.693 --> 53:18.194
Good thing it was intimate.

53:19.696 --> 53:21.281
Hey, consuegros!

53:21.364 --> 53:24.284
Grab some champagne
and come aboard!

53:25.911 --> 53:27.120
What is he, a Bond villain?

53:27.203 --> 53:29.706
Whoever he is,
he's my new best friend.

53:42.052 --> 53:43.637
Look! Ozuna!

54:30.266 --> 54:31.768
Thank you, my friend.

54:34.396 --> 54:35.397
Ozuna!

54:42.237 --> 54:46.866
Michael Mann and Don Johnson
came every Saturday

54:46.950 --> 54:50.370
to eat at my restaurant
when they were shooting Miami Vice.

54:50.453 --> 54:53.999
My husband ran the place,
and I was the cook.

54:54.082 --> 54:56.209
Amazing. And then
what happened?

54:56.292 --> 54:59.129
Luisito died,
and we had to close the place.

54:59.212 --> 55:01.506
He was a saint.

55:01.589 --> 55:02.841
I'm so sorry.

55:02.924 --> 55:04.009
No, no, it's fine.

55:04.092 --> 55:05.844
-As I was saying...
-Ma, Ma...

55:05.927 --> 55:07.303
prima Yolanda's
looking for you.

55:07.387 --> 55:09.639
Something about the flan
being better than yours.

55:09.723 --> 55:11.558
She doesn't even know
how to beat eggs.

55:11.641 --> 55:13.476
That flan is from a bakery.

55:14.477 --> 55:15.562
I thought you needed a break.

55:15.645 --> 55:18.064
-No, she's lovely.
-She is.

55:18.148 --> 55:20.984
I can see where you guys
get your spark from.

55:21.067 --> 55:22.402
Oh, thank you.

55:22.485 --> 55:26.114
Adán said that you were
an interior decorator?

55:26.197 --> 55:27.907
-He did?
-Yes.

55:27.991 --> 55:32.662
Well, it was a while ago,
but I did some things.

55:32.746 --> 55:36.082
Well, I just bought
a hotel chain.

55:36.166 --> 55:39.169
Maybe you can help me
to remodel it.

55:39.836 --> 55:41.421
Really?

55:41.504 --> 55:43.715
I have to warn you.
I don't come cheap.

55:43.798 --> 55:46.176
Nor should you.
Come on, let's go dance.

55:46.259 --> 55:47.927
-Let's do it.

55:57.771 --> 55:59.355
Cora tells me that...

55:59.439 --> 56:02.358
Los Inmortales
won't be playing at Sofi's wedding.

56:04.486 --> 56:06.696
Times change, I guess.

56:08.156 --> 56:09.365
No priest, no church.

56:10.617 --> 56:11.785
Wow.

56:14.162 --> 56:16.289
Tío, I can't keep fighting Sofi
on everything.

56:16.372 --> 56:17.791
I get it.

56:17.874 --> 56:21.920
But if we don't preserve
our tradition, who will, son?

56:22.003 --> 56:23.004
Who will?

56:23.880 --> 56:24.881
Hold this.

56:25.673 --> 56:26.800
There is Ozuna.

56:27.717 --> 56:29.052
Ozuna!

56:29.135 --> 56:31.137
Ever hear of the Immortales?

56:32.138 --> 56:33.306
Come with me.

56:33.389 --> 56:36.643
Excuse me, sir,
does it have shrimp?

56:46.778 --> 56:49.280
So, how's the father
of the bride?

56:49.364 --> 56:51.116
A son is a son
until he takes a wife,

56:51.199 --> 56:53.243
but a daughter's a daughter
all her life.

56:53.326 --> 56:54.494
A little old-fashioned.

56:54.577 --> 56:55.954
Classic never dies.

56:56.037 --> 56:57.664
Touché.

56:57.747 --> 57:00.750
Anyway, I'm going to need you
to docu-sign this here and here.

57:02.001 --> 57:03.461
Mariachis?

57:03.545 --> 57:07.090
A hundred pounds of carne asada
made with wagyu beef?

57:07.173 --> 57:10.343
Floridian wagyu
can be a bit chewy, so we're importing it.

57:10.426 --> 57:12.387
Of course. Imported.
Who authorized this?

57:12.470 --> 57:14.389
Um, Hernán.

57:14.472 --> 57:15.515
Oh, Hernán.

57:16.975 --> 57:19.978
You have ten thousand dollars
in fireworks. Who is he?

57:20.061 --> 57:21.104
The Great Gatsby?

57:21.187 --> 57:22.522
I don't know who that is,
but...

57:22.605 --> 57:24.190
A thousand guests?

57:24.274 --> 57:26.067
A thousand guests!

57:26.151 --> 57:27.277
Well, that went well.

57:27.360 --> 57:28.903
Excuse me,
I need to talk to you.

57:28.987 --> 57:31.322
Billy, meet my mom.

57:33.449 --> 57:36.035

You raised an angel, such a beautiful thing.

57:36.119 --> 57:37.370
Thank you, love.

57:37.453 --> 57:39.539
Okay. We are here, join me.

57:39.622 --> 57:40.874
I have a surprise.

57:40.957 --> 57:42.667
-Another one?
-Yes.

57:42.750 --> 57:43.918
-Great.
-Natalie!

57:44.002 --> 57:46.880
Where is... Natalie, join us.
Come on.

57:59.559 --> 58:00.476
Wow.

58:01.060 --> 58:02.896
Wow.

58:02.979 --> 58:06.441
I just bought a pied-à-terre.
Come on.

58:06.524 --> 58:07.650
-You bought this?
-What?

58:07.734 --> 58:09.235
It's more like I traded it in.

58:09.319 --> 58:11.529
A friend of mine
who could not repay a loan

58:11.613 --> 58:13.031
from our bank said to me...

58:13.114 --> 58:15.366
"Take my house in Miami."
And I said to him, "No..."

58:17.285 --> 58:19.495
But you always need a house
whenever you want to come and visit.

58:19.579 --> 58:21.247
So I said, "Why not?"

58:21.331 --> 58:23.541
It is beautiful.
Spectacular.

58:23.625 --> 58:25.585
But I want to change the color.

58:27.212 --> 58:30.089
I also like
Spanish architecture

58:30.173 --> 58:32.467
so I thought you'd like it.

58:32.550 --> 58:33.885
No, Billy?

58:33.968 --> 58:35.094
It's Italian.

58:35.178 --> 58:36.304
Billy...

58:36.971 --> 58:37.972
Be good.

58:39.182 --> 58:40.558
That is not working,
the fountain.

58:40.642 --> 58:42.644
Please call Pancho to fix it,
okay?

58:42.727 --> 58:43.978
Thank you, love.

58:44.062 --> 58:45.939
Hernán, this is such
a beautiful home.

58:46.022 --> 58:48.942
I agree.
It would make a great spot for a wedding, don't you think?

58:49.025 --> 58:50.944
Yeah. I mean,
we just want to get married.

58:51.027 --> 58:52.779
You wanted an outdoor wedding.

58:52.862 --> 58:55.073
What better way to break
in the new place than doing it here, right?

58:55.156 --> 58:57.116
What do you say, Natalie?

58:57.200 --> 58:58.952
But we can't even find
enough salad forks.

58:59.035 --> 59:00.245
Suck it, Kyler.

59:01.579 --> 59:03.456
Yes, we can!

59:04.999 --> 59:06.084
No, we can't.

59:07.085 --> 59:08.461
-I'm sorry?
-I said...

59:08.544 --> 59:09.754

No, we can't.

59:09.837 --> 59:11.214
You don't get to waltz
in here

59:11.297 --> 59:12.632
and impose your will
on the wedding

59:12.715 --> 59:14.467
that I'm throwing
for my daughter.

59:14.550 --> 59:15.760
What I am imposing?

59:15.843 --> 59:17.470
Ten thousand dollars
in fireworks,

59:17.553 --> 59:20.181
ten crates of tequila
from Guadalajara, mariachis,

59:20.265 --> 59:21.808
a hundred platters
of carne asada.

59:21.891 --> 59:23.434
I offered to pay for them.

59:23.518 --> 59:25.645
Am I not supposed
to have my traditions

59:25.728 --> 59:28.815
at my own son's wedding
just because you don't approve?

59:28.898 --> 59:30.275
Traditions?

59:30.358 --> 59:32.193
What part of México
does wagyu beef come from?

59:32.277 --> 59:33.820
It's a modern spin.

59:33.903 --> 59:37.073
Yeah? At 150 bucks a pop.
And then you hit on my wife.

59:37.156 --> 59:38.157
-Dad!
-What?

59:38.241 --> 59:39.826
Billy, not now. No.

59:39.909 --> 59:41.953
I think you should
take a step back, pal.

59:42.036 --> 59:43.663
No, you take a step back,
my friend.

59:43.746 --> 59:46.165
I didn't come across the ocean
with two cents in my pocket...

59:46.249 --> 59:47.250
You came by plane.

59:47.333 --> 59:48.668
Yeah. But a lot of us didn't.

59:48.751 --> 59:50.044
And we didn't come
to this country

59:50.128 --> 59:51.754
so some aging hipster
in a yacht...

59:51.838 --> 59:54.090
could come in and impose
a thousand-person wedding on us.

59:54.173 --> 59:56.342

Speak to me in Spanish, you Napoleonic Cuban!

59:56.426 --> 59:57.844

I'll talk to you in Spanish, you clown!

59:57.927 --> 59:59.095
What about you, whitexican?

59:59.178 --> 1:00:00.305
Who are you calling "Cubano,"
eh?

1:00:02.015 --> 1:00:03.182
No.

1:00:03.266 --> 1:00:05.351
You tacky whitexican.

1:00:06.728 --> 1:00:08.521
So are you, bro!
So are you!

1:00:19.866 --> 1:00:22.618
What the hell is wrong
with you crazies?

1:00:22.702 --> 1:00:24.037
Shut up!

1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:26.289
What is all this Sharks
versus Jets shit?

1:00:26.372 --> 1:00:28.541
We're all Sharks here.

1:00:28.624 --> 1:00:30.376
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

1:00:30.460 --> 1:00:32.920
You're taking a day
that's supposed to be all about our kids

1:00:33.004 --> 1:00:35.673
and making it all about you.

1:00:35.757 --> 1:00:37.884
How could you embarrass
our family like this?

1:00:37.967 --> 1:00:39.469
This house is beautiful.

1:00:39.552 --> 1:00:41.054
And it's what
our daughter wants.

1:00:41.137 --> 1:00:43.014
No. That's not what I want.

1:00:43.097 --> 1:00:45.266

So the one with the gold makes the rules?

1:00:45.350 --> 1:00:46.434

Yes, the one with the gold makes the rules.

1:00:46.517 --> 1:00:47.894
He offered to pay, Billy.

1:00:47.977 --> 1:00:49.645
Yeah? Well, I'm the father
of the bride, not him.

1:00:49.729 --> 1:00:51.272
And I call the shots, not you.

1:00:51.356 --> 1:00:53.024
And I don't approve of weddings
with no shoes.

1:00:53.107 --> 1:00:55.109
And I don't approve of weddings
with Zen priests.

1:00:55.193 --> 1:00:57.195
And I don't approve
of a wedding with a thousand guests.

1:00:57.278 --> 1:00:59.781
And I don't approve my girl
marrying that boy.

1:00:59.864 --> 1:01:00.865
Dad!

1:01:10.917 --> 1:01:13.086
You're just the father
of the bride.

1:01:14.420 --> 1:01:17.548
You don't get to approve
who I marry.

1:01:18.216 --> 1:01:19.425
So in two weeks,

1:01:19.509 --> 1:01:21.469
I'm gonna walk down
that aisle

1:01:21.552 --> 1:01:23.429
and I'm gonna marry that man...

1:01:23.513 --> 1:01:24.931
whether you're next to me
or not.

1:01:25.014 --> 1:01:26.808
And if you don't wanna
be there, Dad...

1:01:27.517 --> 1:01:28.810
that's on you.

1:01:33.314 --> 1:01:34.649
I'm so sorry.

1:01:38.027 --> 1:01:40.738
You went too far.

1:01:45.034 --> 1:01:46.119
Shit.

1:02:19.318 --> 1:02:20.778
Okay, come on.

1:02:20.862 --> 1:02:23.156
You don't need
to keep pretending. Just answer him.

1:02:23.239 --> 1:02:24.407
Answer who?

1:02:24.490 --> 1:02:25.825
David. The guy
who keeps texting you.

1:02:25.908 --> 1:02:27.952
Oh, please. You're pathetic.

1:02:28.035 --> 1:02:29.287
-I'm pathetic?
-Yes.

1:02:29.370 --> 1:02:30.955
Who is it?
And why do you keep hiding?

1:02:31.038 --> 1:02:33.499
-I'm not hiding.
-Go on, just answer him.

1:02:33.583 --> 1:02:36.002
-Oh. You want me to answer him?
-Yes.

1:02:38.045 --> 1:02:40.006
Okay. Fine.

1:02:41.591 --> 1:02:42.550
"Hi, David.

1:02:42.633 --> 1:02:44.427
"Can't talk right now.

1:02:44.510 --> 1:02:46.012
"But when can we finally meet

1:02:46.095 --> 1:02:48.514
to discuss
divorce proceedings

1:02:48.598 --> 1:02:52.018
"because I can't take this
one more second.

1:02:52.101 --> 1:02:53.144
"Thank you."

1:02:53.227 --> 1:02:54.937
-Send.
-Who's David?

1:02:55.605 --> 1:02:56.814
My lawyer.

1:03:13.414 --> 1:03:15.625
You know, today was supposed
to be fun.

1:03:15.708 --> 1:03:18.377
But you ruined it for everyone.

1:03:18.461 --> 1:03:20.046
And why?

1:03:20.129 --> 1:03:23.299
Maybe because things
weren't being done to your standards.

1:03:23.382 --> 1:03:27.261
Who made you
the standard bearer of everything?

1:03:27.345 --> 1:03:29.388
I thought you would have
gotten the message by now

1:03:29.472 --> 1:03:31.766
but it's clear that that's not
gonna happen.

1:03:32.475 --> 1:03:33.684
I'm done.

1:04:09.220 --> 1:04:11.013
I'm not a bridesmaid,
that's for sure.

1:04:11.097 --> 1:04:12.765
I thought maybe
you're her friend from college or something.

1:04:12.848 --> 1:04:14.809
-I don't know. I mean,
you look good. -Okay.

1:04:18.271 --> 1:04:19.313
Do we love it?

1:04:19.397 --> 1:04:20.606
-You look amazing.
-Oh, my God!

1:04:20.690 --> 1:04:22.316
That is gorgeous.

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:24.443
-Cora, it's beautiful.
-Cora, seriously.

1:04:24.527 --> 1:04:26.487
-You did an amazing job.
-Oh, my God.

1:04:30.491 --> 1:04:31.742
It's okay.

1:04:31.826 --> 1:04:33.953
Don't worry. It'll be done
by the wedding.

1:04:34.036 --> 1:04:35.955
Some people actually like
for their sleeves to fall off.

1:04:36.038 --> 1:04:37.123
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:04:37.206 --> 1:04:38.791
-Yeah.
-Trendy.

1:04:38.874 --> 1:04:39.875
Can I try mine on?

1:04:39.959 --> 1:04:41.168
I need two more days.

1:04:41.252 --> 1:04:43.087
Two more days?
The wedding's in four.

1:04:43.170 --> 1:04:45.756
-No. We're running
a little behind. -A little?

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:46.966
Don't start with me, Sofi,
okay?

1:04:47.049 --> 1:04:48.801
You're gonna make me nervous.

1:04:48.884 --> 1:04:50.720
I'm gonna make you nervous?

1:04:50.803 --> 1:04:52.763
-Is that my wedding dress?
-Yeah.

1:04:52.847 --> 1:04:54.307
I based my design off of it.

1:04:54.390 --> 1:04:56.475
With the shoulder pads.

1:04:56.559 --> 1:04:57.643
Yeah.

1:04:57.727 --> 1:04:58.686
Try it on.

1:04:58.769 --> 1:05:00.980
Yes.
Yes, Mom. Yes, please.

1:05:01.063 --> 1:05:03.274
It's Sofi's moment, not mine.

1:05:03.357 --> 1:05:04.525
No, Mom, no. Don't be silly.

1:05:04.609 --> 1:05:06.319
-We'll get violent.
-You have to.

1:05:06.402 --> 1:05:07.486
-Really?
-Yes, you can.

1:05:07.570 --> 1:05:08.821
-Come on.
-I'll help you put it on.

1:05:08.904 --> 1:05:10.740
I don't think
I'm gonna fit into this.

1:05:10.823 --> 1:05:12.533

Try it on! Try it on! Try it on!

1:05:12.617 --> 1:05:13.868
Okay, okay, okay.

1:05:13.951 --> 1:05:16.329
Well, you can always
not close the zipper.

1:05:16.412 --> 1:05:17.622
Wait, wait, wait.

1:05:17.705 --> 1:05:19.332
-Okay. Okay.
-After all these years.

1:05:19.415 --> 1:05:20.666
I've never been so scared
putting on a dress.

1:05:20.750 --> 1:05:22.376
-Okay. Here we go.
-Oh, my Lord.

1:05:22.460 --> 1:05:25.087
-I really should have
gotten the Vaseline. -Yeah.

1:05:25.171 --> 1:05:27.214
You gotta grease me up.

1:05:27.298 --> 1:05:29.342

Mom, be careful you almost fell!

1:05:29.425 --> 1:05:30.801
You're gonna knock me over.

1:05:30.885 --> 1:05:32.887
-Okay, hold it.
-Okay. Okay.

1:05:32.970 --> 1:05:34.180
-Okay.

1:05:34.263 --> 1:05:36.182
-Whoa! Oh, my...
-There we go. There we go.

1:05:36.265 --> 1:05:38.809
I feel really bad for her.
Like...

1:05:40.353 --> 1:05:41.395
Hi.

1:05:44.940 --> 1:05:46.359
Am I interrupting?

1:05:50.071 --> 1:05:51.364
I got snacks.

1:05:52.865 --> 1:05:54.075
From Vicky's.

1:05:56.202 --> 1:05:57.203
Okay.

1:05:59.080 --> 1:06:01.415
Put it over here
and I'm on my way.

1:06:14.345 --> 1:06:15.429
I'm sorry.

1:06:18.224 --> 1:06:19.600
Still mad at you.

1:06:21.018 --> 1:06:21.852
You know.

1:06:44.166 --> 1:06:45.334
Cora made this?

1:06:46.836 --> 1:06:47.837
Yeah.

1:06:48.671 --> 1:06:50.047
She's good.

1:06:52.174 --> 1:06:55.052
She's a mess, but she's good.

1:06:58.639 --> 1:07:00.141
Ta da!

1:07:00.224 --> 1:07:02.101
-Oh, my God!

1:07:02.184 --> 1:07:03.644
-Gorgeous.
-Beautiful.

1:07:03.728 --> 1:07:05.771
-We need to take some pictures.
-Oh, my God.

1:07:10.651 --> 1:07:13.946
Today is your day.

1:07:14.029 --> 1:07:15.948
No, Mom. No.
We can share it.

1:07:50.399 --> 1:07:52.067
What is up, my Mexican brother?

1:07:52.151 --> 1:07:53.903
Are you ready to see
the real Miami?

1:07:53.986 --> 1:07:54.904
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:07:54.987 --> 1:07:56.530
Can I get a hell yeah?

1:07:56.614 --> 1:07:58.115
-Hell yeah.

1:07:58.199 --> 1:08:01.202
Hey, it's not your funeral.
Tonight is your night.

1:08:01.285 --> 1:08:02.411
Hell yeah.

1:08:10.711 --> 1:08:12.338
Where's your dad?
He's not coming?

1:08:14.965 --> 1:08:16.592
He wasn't feeling well.

1:08:18.761 --> 1:08:21.013
Hey, what is this, a funeral?
Come on, move over, move over.

1:08:21.096 --> 1:08:22.097
Let's go.

1:08:27.478 --> 1:08:30.272
You beautiful thing!

1:08:30.356 --> 1:08:31.482
Wow.

1:08:31.565 --> 1:08:34.193
I love you, my darling!
Oh, my God.

1:08:34.276 --> 1:08:35.694
I'm gonna get a heart attack.

1:08:37.988 --> 1:08:39.865
Oye, hey, where's the bachelor?

1:08:43.369 --> 1:08:44.578
No, no, no.

1:08:44.662 --> 1:08:47.414
Somebody call 911.
The party police is here.

1:08:47.498 --> 1:08:49.041
Acting like a dead fly, huh?

1:08:49.125 --> 1:08:50.543
Guys.

1:08:50.626 --> 1:08:52.044
-It's not so easy, bro.
-No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.

1:08:52.127 --> 1:08:53.546
-Hey.
-Good girl.

1:08:53.629 --> 1:08:55.339
-Hey. Hey. No, no, no. Hey.
-Watch the loafers!

1:08:55.422 --> 1:08:56.882
Hey, hey, hey.

1:08:56.966 --> 1:08:59.051
Billy's around. Billy's around.
Come on. Billy's around.

1:08:59.134 --> 1:09:00.386
It's your turn to get down.

1:09:02.429 --> 1:09:05.140
No. You're gonna have
to go through him.

1:09:07.101 --> 1:09:09.436
Amor, how are you?

1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:11.188
How's the bachelor
party?

1:09:11.272 --> 1:09:13.190
-I can't hear you.
How's dinner? -It was good.

1:09:13.274 --> 1:09:15.693
We tried this new restaurant
by Coconut Grove

1:09:15.776 --> 1:09:17.444
but I think we're gonna call it
a night.

1:09:17.528 --> 1:09:19.071
Yeah. Same here.

1:09:19.154 --> 1:09:20.990
We're just gonna grab
a couple beers and head home.

1:09:21.073 --> 1:09:22.700
You don't have to pretend.

1:09:22.783 --> 1:09:24.952
I don't like
the whole exploiting women for money thing.

1:09:25.035 --> 1:09:26.662
You know that. The...

1:09:26.745 --> 1:09:28.706
Then why did you have Junior
plan your bachelor party?

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:36.088
Amor, gotta go. Love you.

1:09:54.064 --> 1:09:55.566
Let's get you laid, abuela.

1:09:59.111 --> 1:10:00.154
Thank you.

1:10:17.713 --> 1:10:19.089
Let's dance.

1:10:19.173 --> 1:10:20.966
I don't think I should.

1:10:21.050 --> 1:10:24.053
It's our children's wedding!

1:10:24.136 --> 1:10:25.304
That's true.

1:10:25.387 --> 1:10:27.556
Your daughter, my son,
our children!

1:10:27.640 --> 1:10:28.849
Okay.

1:10:38.025 --> 1:10:38.984
Uh...

1:10:39.818 --> 1:10:42.821
The things I said...

1:10:44.323 --> 1:10:47.826
to you and about you
the other day at the island

1:10:47.910 --> 1:10:49.370
was inexcusable.

1:10:50.412 --> 1:10:52.164
Billy...

1:10:52.247 --> 1:10:54.541
My dad gets under my skin
all the time.

1:10:54.625 --> 1:10:56.168
-That's very kind of you.
-I understand.

1:10:56.251 --> 1:10:58.671
That's very kind of you,
but you deserve an explanation.

1:11:00.422 --> 1:11:03.050
I haven't been myself lately
because...

1:11:08.597 --> 1:11:11.225
Ingrid and I are getting
a divorce.

1:11:14.561 --> 1:11:15.729
Billy...

1:11:17.439 --> 1:11:18.899
I'm so sorry. I...

1:11:18.983 --> 1:11:21.819
We were gonna break the news
to Sofi the other night...

1:11:21.902 --> 1:11:25.864
but then she announced
her engagement to you

1:11:25.948 --> 1:11:27.533
so you can understand
how I felt

1:11:27.616 --> 1:11:29.743
when I learned
that her new boyfriend was gonna take...

1:11:31.996 --> 1:11:34.331
Take my girl away
from me to Mexico.

1:11:37.292 --> 1:11:39.336
My whole family's
falling apart.

1:11:44.174 --> 1:11:46.802
So I'm sorry for taking it out
on you. I know it's not your fault.

1:11:46.885 --> 1:11:50.347
Although at the end
of the day...

1:11:52.182 --> 1:11:53.392
of course it is.

1:11:55.227 --> 1:11:58.647
Just to set the record
straight...

1:11:58.731 --> 1:12:01.400
it wasn't my idea
to go back to Mexico.

1:12:02.609 --> 1:12:03.652
What do you mean?

1:12:03.736 --> 1:12:05.446
Well, I love New York.

1:12:05.529 --> 1:12:07.948
No one knew who I was.
I could be myself.

1:12:08.032 --> 1:12:10.951
And when I met Sofi,
I knew she liked me for who I was.

1:12:12.578 --> 1:12:14.038
So why are you going
back to Mexico?

1:12:14.121 --> 1:12:16.665
She found a job that mattered
to her there.

1:12:19.043 --> 1:12:21.670
So you're following her back
to your country?

1:12:21.754 --> 1:12:22.963
Yeah.

1:12:23.047 --> 1:12:24.089
Ironically.

1:12:25.674 --> 1:12:26.717
Yeah.

1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:28.260
What about you?

1:12:28.344 --> 1:12:31.180
New York, your career?
Your own plans?

1:12:31.263 --> 1:12:34.641
My plans are to figure
out a life next to your daughter.

1:12:35.851 --> 1:12:38.103
And when she saw
all the immigrants

1:12:38.187 --> 1:12:41.148
stuck at the Mexican border,
you know...

1:12:41.231 --> 1:12:43.984
she told me
how much you guys struggled to get here.

1:12:44.068 --> 1:12:46.987
And she felt like she had to do
something about it.

1:12:47.071 --> 1:12:49.948
So I just chose to join her.

1:12:54.661 --> 1:12:56.955
I'm gonna tell Sofi
about the divorce

1:12:57.039 --> 1:12:58.457
after you come back
from the honeymoon.

1:12:58.540 --> 1:13:00.626
So I'm gonna need you
to keep this quiet.

1:13:02.002 --> 1:13:03.587
-Billy...
-Listen, I know it's a tall order.

1:13:03.670 --> 1:13:06.632
I just want you to understand
that...

1:13:06.715 --> 1:13:11.804
Well, I didn't want you
to get married without knowing that I approve.

1:13:11.887 --> 1:13:15.140
So you approve
of this marriage, then?

1:13:18.018 --> 1:13:19.478
Of course I do.

1:13:24.650 --> 1:13:27.820
I'm sorry.
Did you need some privacy?

1:13:27.903 --> 1:13:30.489
-No, we're all done here.
-Yeah.

1:13:30.572 --> 1:13:32.032
Come on, papi.

1:13:34.618 --> 1:13:37.204
What's the matter with you?
You have a heart condition.

1:13:37.287 --> 1:13:39.248
I can die doing what I love.

1:13:40.707 --> 1:13:42.459
Okay, great. One last kiss.
Let's go.

1:13:42.543 --> 1:13:43.836
Come on. I'm taking you home.

1:13:43.919 --> 1:13:45.879
-Wait, no...
-Yeah. All right. Here we go.

1:13:45.963 --> 1:13:47.756
See you later, alligator.

1:13:52.302 --> 1:13:53.971
I feel like I've gotten
a lot of pressure from you.

1:13:54.054 --> 1:13:55.806
-Shots. Let's go!
-Okay.

1:13:55.889 --> 1:13:58.934
It's the first time
that I go out since Hernáncito was born.

1:13:59.017 --> 1:14:00.686
I don't wanna go.

1:14:00.769 --> 1:14:03.188
I'll look after Hernáncito
if you wanna sleep in.

1:14:03.272 --> 1:14:04.731
-Yeah.
-Did you pump milk?

1:14:04.815 --> 1:14:05.983
Yes.

1:14:06.066 --> 1:14:07.359
It's in the fridge.
Would you do that?

1:14:07.442 --> 1:14:08.735
-Yes. I will.
-Yes.

1:14:08.819 --> 1:14:10.195
-Gracias.

1:14:10.279 --> 1:14:12.281
You know, I thought
you hated each other.

1:14:12.364 --> 1:14:14.867
No. We just like to make
Hernán think

1:14:14.950 --> 1:14:16.869
that we're fighting over him.

1:14:16.952 --> 1:14:20.831
This is truly an evolved state
that you two are in.

1:14:33.010 --> 1:14:35.220
-Come on, let's go dance.
Come on. -No. That's my drink.

1:14:35.304 --> 1:14:37.264
Whoa, whoa. No.

1:14:37.347 --> 1:14:39.183
-It's your bachelorette party.
-I know.

1:14:39.266 --> 1:14:41.560
I'm just worried
that you're gonna wake up hungover tomorrow

1:14:41.643 --> 1:14:43.562
and you have all those dresses
to finish.

1:14:43.645 --> 1:14:44.897
-Hey. Hey, hey.
-Just saying.

1:14:44.980 --> 1:14:47.733
Relax. I got this.

1:14:47.816 --> 1:14:50.152
Cora, the wedding's
in two days.

1:14:50.235 --> 1:14:53.947
All I'm asking is for you
to take it just a little bit more seriously.

1:14:54.031 --> 1:14:55.782
Right. Yes. You're...

1:14:55.866 --> 1:14:59.411
Sofi, you're such a wise soul,
and I'm such a mess.

1:14:59.494 --> 1:15:01.830
-You're not a mess.
-Why don't I follow your example.

1:15:01.914 --> 1:15:03.707
I'm gonna go back to work

1:15:03.790 --> 1:15:05.083
-while everyone else
is out here celebrating. -That's not what I meant.

1:15:05.167 --> 1:15:08.128
-Have fun! Bye!
-Wait. Really?

1:15:08.212 --> 1:15:10.255
She'll forget everything
tomorrow.

1:15:11.006 --> 1:15:12.633
Good God.

1:15:12.716 --> 1:15:14.801
-Two more, please.
-Yes, please.

1:15:14.885 --> 1:15:16.428
And one for her.

1:15:27.606 --> 1:15:29.608
Papi.

1:15:29.691 --> 1:15:31.235
Papi, there's a storm coming.

1:15:37.741 --> 1:15:39.117
I don't think so, sweetheart.

1:15:39.201 --> 1:15:41.245
It's veering off
into the warm water.

1:15:42.579 --> 1:15:45.040
Yeah. But what if it doesn't?

1:15:45.123 --> 1:15:48.585
I mean, your whole family
has flown here.

1:15:48.669 --> 1:15:51.088
Cora's been working
on the dresses forever.

1:15:51.171 --> 1:15:52.673
We've been planning
this wedding

1:15:52.756 --> 1:15:54.299
for an entire month.

1:15:54.383 --> 1:15:55.425
I mean...

1:15:55.509 --> 1:15:56.635
Do you wanna cancel it?

1:15:56.718 --> 1:15:58.512
No, no. I don't wanna...

1:15:58.595 --> 1:16:01.306
Whatever you wanna do,
I'll support you either way.

1:16:01.390 --> 1:16:02.724
I don't wanna cancel it.

1:16:02.808 --> 1:16:04.935
I'm just having, like,
a bad feeling about this.

1:16:05.018 --> 1:16:07.521
I don't know,
it feels like this is a sign.

1:16:07.604 --> 1:16:08.814
I mean, maybe we're rushing it.

1:16:08.897 --> 1:16:09.856
Maybe we're rushing
all of this.

1:16:09.940 --> 1:16:11.942
Quelite, hey.

1:16:12.025 --> 1:16:14.194
It's not a sign,
and we are rushing things

1:16:14.278 --> 1:16:17.114
precisely 'cause we wanna
start our lives together as soon as possible.

1:16:18.323 --> 1:16:19.741
-No?
-Yeah.

1:16:19.825 --> 1:16:21.326
Yeah.

1:16:21.410 --> 1:16:23.745
So we decided to get married
during storm season in Miami.

1:16:25.455 --> 1:16:28.250
-It's my bad.
-Kind of.

1:16:28.333 --> 1:16:31.336
Hey, we're a team.
We can get through this.

1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:33.463
Now, let's go
to this rehearsal dinner.

1:16:36.591 --> 1:16:39.261
One, two, three.

1:16:39.344 --> 1:16:40.679
Don't roll your eyes at me,
honey.

1:16:40.762 --> 1:16:42.514
Petals to the left
and petals to the right.

1:16:42.597 --> 1:16:44.683
-My head is about to burst.

1:16:49.271 --> 1:16:50.731
It's miraculous!

1:16:50.814 --> 1:16:53.025
At what time
did you leave the club?

1:16:53.108 --> 1:16:54.651
Two in the morning.

1:16:55.152 --> 1:16:56.236
You?

1:16:56.320 --> 1:16:58.071
I left the club at six.

1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:15.380
Is it too tight?
Hey, no.

1:17:15.464 --> 1:17:18.216
Tyler. Tyler. Not that dress.
That's not your dress.

1:17:18.300 --> 1:17:21.386
This is your dress.
Go in there, put it on. And...

1:17:21.470 --> 1:17:23.972
Cora, honey. Cora, rehearsal.
Come on, let's go.

1:17:24.056 --> 1:17:26.308
Huan, please take care of her
and finish pinning her.

1:17:26.391 --> 1:17:27.809
And I gotta go.

1:17:27.893 --> 1:17:30.020
You don't pay me enough
for this madness.

1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:34.232
What are you doing?

1:17:34.316 --> 1:17:35.901
Rehearsal has started!

1:17:35.984 --> 1:17:37.652
Are you kidding me?

1:17:37.736 --> 1:17:40.697
I want to finish
burrying the knives to prevent the storm!

1:17:40.781 --> 1:17:43.742
Mom, don't be ridiculous.

1:17:45.494 --> 1:17:47.621
Give me those knives.

1:17:47.704 --> 1:17:49.206
You see?

1:17:54.836 --> 1:17:56.797
I really like him.

1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:59.674
You two make
a beautiful couple.

1:18:00.842 --> 1:18:02.469
I learned from the best.

1:18:06.181 --> 1:18:07.432
Where is Cora?

1:18:07.516 --> 1:18:09.935
-Let's go. Come on. Okay.
-Here we go.

1:18:10.018 --> 1:18:12.938
Bridesmaids. And it's one,
two. One, two.

1:18:13.021 --> 1:18:16.441
Cora, let's go. Come on.
One, two. Elegant.

1:18:16.525 --> 1:18:19.486
And now, who's gonna
give this girl away?

1:18:21.530 --> 1:18:22.697
I'd like to.

1:18:26.159 --> 1:18:27.160
Okay.

1:18:56.565 --> 1:18:59.317
The groom's mother
just called me an everything bagel.

1:18:59.401 --> 1:19:02.487
She says I'm everything
she ever wanted to taste in one bite.

1:19:02.571 --> 1:19:04.906
The little puppy has a bite.

1:19:08.869 --> 1:19:10.036
Out with it.

1:19:11.121 --> 1:19:12.873
I've known you for a long time.

1:19:14.040 --> 1:19:15.125
What's wrong?

1:19:17.419 --> 1:19:18.420
Come with me.

1:19:23.967 --> 1:19:25.760
What's going on?

1:19:28.763 --> 1:19:31.433
You know how Ingrid and I
have been going to therapy?

1:19:31.516 --> 1:19:32.851
Yeah.

1:19:32.934 --> 1:19:34.352
Well, it hasn't panned out,
and she wants a divorce.

1:19:35.479 --> 1:19:37.522
You're getting divorced?

1:19:37.606 --> 1:19:39.191
Cora. Cora, Cora. Don't you...

1:19:39.274 --> 1:19:40.692
No!
Mom.

1:19:40.775 --> 1:19:42.903
Pfft.
Are you getting divorced?

1:19:47.324 --> 1:19:48.366
What did she say?

1:19:51.620 --> 1:19:52.704
Mom?

1:19:53.538 --> 1:19:54.998
Billy.

1:19:55.081 --> 1:19:56.166
Dad?

1:19:57.417 --> 1:19:58.543
Cora?

1:19:58.627 --> 1:20:02.005
-Can someone say something?
-Girls.

1:20:02.088 --> 1:20:04.716
We never intended for you
to find out like this.

1:20:04.799 --> 1:20:06.051
Divorce?

1:20:06.134 --> 1:20:08.011
What do you mean, divorced?

1:20:08.094 --> 1:20:10.430
You can't get divorced.

1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:13.016
Was there someone else?

1:20:13.099 --> 1:20:15.227
-No!
-Mami, butt out, please.

1:20:15.310 --> 1:20:17.062
We don't get divorced.

1:20:17.145 --> 1:20:20.690
Not even when I found out
that Luisito had a second family,

1:20:20.774 --> 1:20:22.692
-did I get divorced?
-What?

1:20:22.776 --> 1:20:23.902
What?

1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:26.905
I need to get out of here.

1:20:26.988 --> 1:20:29.241
Quelite, Quelite. Wait, wait,
wait. Calm down, okay?

1:20:29.324 --> 1:20:31.034
We're gonna figure this out,
I promise.

1:20:31.117 --> 1:20:32.494
How? How?

1:20:32.577 --> 1:20:34.579
-They've been lying to us
the whole time. -No.

1:20:34.663 --> 1:20:37.624
They didn't have a choice.
What else were they supposed to do?

1:20:38.792 --> 1:20:39.835
Did you know?

1:20:41.127 --> 1:20:42.462
What? No. No.

1:20:42.546 --> 1:20:43.922
-Oh, my God.
-No. Quelite, wait. Please.

1:20:44.005 --> 1:20:45.590
-Sofi, Sofi!
-Get off of me.

1:20:45.674 --> 1:20:49.010
It wasn't his fault.
I told him not to say anything.

1:20:49.094 --> 1:20:50.679
You told Adán, Billy?

1:20:50.762 --> 1:20:52.639
What the hell
were you thinking?

1:20:52.722 --> 1:20:53.848
Look at us.

1:20:53.932 --> 1:20:55.892
You fighting.
You lying.

1:20:58.687 --> 1:20:59.854
I can't get married like this.

1:20:59.938 --> 1:21:02.649
-No. Amor.
-Oh, Billy.

1:21:06.111 --> 1:21:08.154
Was there shrimp in this?

1:21:08.238 --> 1:21:09.364
-Oh, God.
-Come on.

1:21:09.447 --> 1:21:11.658
You made this mess. Go fix it.

1:21:32.178 --> 1:21:34.889
Hey, have you seen Sofi?

1:21:59.497 --> 1:22:00.540
May I sit down?

1:22:10.425 --> 1:22:12.677
This is where your mom
and I got married.

1:22:17.682 --> 1:22:20.018
Don't worry about us.
Live your life.

1:22:21.227 --> 1:22:22.854
Because people like Adán,

1:22:22.938 --> 1:22:25.482
they don't come along
that often.

1:22:27.442 --> 1:22:28.693
How, Dad?

1:22:30.111 --> 1:22:33.281
Everyone says
that marriage is a dying thing,

1:22:33.365 --> 1:22:36.618
but you guys were
one of my few pillars of hope.

1:22:41.998 --> 1:22:45.085
Why are you getting a divorce?

1:22:45.168 --> 1:22:47.754
That would be unfair
for me to answer with your mom not here

1:22:47.837 --> 1:22:51.049
but I will tell you
that it's not her fault.

1:22:51.132 --> 1:22:53.385
-So you wanted it?
-No.

1:22:53.468 --> 1:22:54.844
Then what happened?

1:22:54.928 --> 1:22:58.056
I think your mom
wanted a partner.

1:22:58.139 --> 1:23:00.517
A partner that she can enjoy
her life with.

1:23:02.018 --> 1:23:04.604
And I stopped being fun.

1:23:04.688 --> 1:23:08.066
I stopped being her accomplice.

1:23:08.900 --> 1:23:10.110
Her friend.

1:23:11.987 --> 1:23:13.947
Why don't you just start
doing it?

1:23:14.989 --> 1:23:16.908
I'm afraid
that ship has sailed.

1:23:17.742 --> 1:23:19.244
Not if you don't let it.

1:23:21.538 --> 1:23:23.081
All I can tell you is that...

1:23:23.164 --> 1:23:25.208
if I would have been
more like Adán...

1:23:26.626 --> 1:23:28.378
this probably
wouldn't have happened.

1:23:31.214 --> 1:23:33.091
Dad, you are like Adán.

1:23:33.174 --> 1:23:34.634
-No.
-Yes.

1:23:34.718 --> 1:23:36.428
You're sensitive.

1:23:36.511 --> 1:23:37.595
You're vulnerable.

1:23:38.555 --> 1:23:40.348
You're supportive.

1:23:40.432 --> 1:23:42.308
You just don't dare to show it.

1:23:45.687 --> 1:23:47.230
That's the difference.

1:23:52.986 --> 1:23:54.362
You need to get back,

1:23:54.446 --> 1:23:56.740
because Adán is probably
losing his mind right now.

1:23:56.823 --> 1:23:58.116
Oh, God.

1:24:06.916 --> 1:24:08.752
-She'll come around.
-You think so?

1:24:08.835 --> 1:24:10.170
Absolutely.

1:24:18.511 --> 1:24:20.305
-Hi.
-I'm so sorry.

1:24:20.388 --> 1:24:22.432
-I swear...
-It's okay. It's okay.

1:24:22.515 --> 1:24:25.477
It's the last secret
I'll ever keep from you.

1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:27.645
Please, please,
please marry me.

1:24:27.729 --> 1:24:29.189
Everything will be okay.

1:24:29.272 --> 1:24:31.441
I really hope so,
because you suck at lying.

1:24:31.524 --> 1:24:32.650
Is that a yes?

1:24:32.734 --> 1:24:33.943
It's a yes.

1:24:39.574 --> 1:24:42.243
The wind has risen
and we've lost power.

1:24:42.327 --> 1:24:44.954
Sergeant Cora, lock the hatch.

1:24:45.038 --> 1:24:46.331
Aye, aye, Captain.

1:24:46.414 --> 1:24:48.917
Corporal Sofi,
I need a head count.

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:50.668
One, two, three, four.

1:24:50.752 --> 1:24:54.631
Lieutenant Herrera,
engage the cryosleep chamber.

1:24:54.714 --> 1:24:56.341
Engaging, sir.

1:25:01.763 --> 1:25:02.806
Help!

1:25:02.889 --> 1:25:03.890
Quickly!

1:25:06.976 --> 1:25:08.061
Hurry up!

1:25:10.313 --> 1:25:11.314
Billy!

1:25:14.442 --> 1:25:16.361
Billy, please.
Get in here quick.

1:25:17.112 --> 1:25:18.112
Hurry up!

1:25:20.114 --> 1:25:21.908
-Hurry up! It's stuck.
-I got it. Get out of the way.

1:25:21.991 --> 1:25:23.409
-It's stuck.
-Get out of the way.

1:25:25.370 --> 1:25:26.412
What happened?

1:25:26.496 --> 1:25:28.164
Just a shutter got stuck.

1:25:32.210 --> 1:25:33.711
We're gonna need a mop.

1:25:40.969 --> 1:25:42.637
Guess the storm sped up.

1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:44.013
We've seen worse.

1:25:44.097 --> 1:25:45.306
Yeah.

1:25:45.390 --> 1:25:46.766
Get some rest.
We got a big day tomorrow.

1:25:51.396 --> 1:25:52.438
Dad?

1:25:53.481 --> 1:25:54.858
Can you stay with us a while?

1:25:59.070 --> 1:26:00.071
Mom?

1:26:11.374 --> 1:26:12.792
Sing it, Sam.

1:27:37.627 --> 1:27:39.796
-You like it?
-I love it.

1:27:39.879 --> 1:27:40.964
-Come here.
-I love it.

1:27:41.047 --> 1:27:42.715
-It's amazing.
-Oh, my God.

1:27:44.259 --> 1:27:45.468
I'm so glad you like it.

1:27:45.551 --> 1:27:46.970
I love it. Thank you.

1:27:47.053 --> 1:27:49.013
-Thank you so much.
-Which one's mine?

1:27:49.097 --> 1:27:51.265
-Chelsea, this is you.
-Wow, you really are a designer.

1:27:51.349 --> 1:27:54.143
And, Vanessa,
I made this one for you 'cause I know you hate dresses.

1:27:54.227 --> 1:27:55.311
Thanks.

1:28:03.569 --> 1:28:05.238
Okay, watch your step.

1:28:05.321 --> 1:28:06.322
Papi.

1:28:08.116 --> 1:28:10.618
I made this for you.

1:28:10.702 --> 1:28:13.454
It's a pearl
from Mom's wedding dress.

1:28:22.338 --> 1:28:23.589
Watch your step.

1:28:26.509 --> 1:28:27.969
Take your time.

1:28:28.052 --> 1:28:29.512
Okay. Thank you, mamá.

1:28:31.597 --> 1:28:33.391
-Dad, you want me...
-Let's go.

1:28:35.226 --> 1:28:36.352
Gotta move.

1:28:36.436 --> 1:28:38.229
Okay. I'll be right back.
I forgot to pee.

1:28:38.312 --> 1:28:39.731
What?

1:28:39.814 --> 1:28:41.357
My God, it never fails.

1:28:50.658 --> 1:28:52.493
We're making good time.
You okay, baby?

1:28:52.577 --> 1:28:54.662
A little nervous,
but I'm good.

1:29:07.967 --> 1:29:09.344
What the hell's going on?

1:29:12.263 --> 1:29:13.514
What are you
looking at?

1:29:14.515 --> 1:29:16.059
The bridge collapsed.

1:29:19.854 --> 1:29:22.440
Get me as close to it
as possible, please.

1:29:28.529 --> 1:29:30.656
-Okay. That's...
-Oh, my God.

1:29:30.740 --> 1:29:32.366
No, no, no.
I have a wedding inside.

1:29:32.450 --> 1:29:33.576
Okay, I don't think
you understand.

1:29:33.659 --> 1:29:35.161
Listen to me for a second.

1:29:35.244 --> 1:29:37.872
Call the chief of police,
tell him that Junior Herrera...

1:29:37.955 --> 1:29:39.957
-I just want you
to understand something. -Junior, take it easy.

1:29:40.041 --> 1:29:41.918
-This is his wedding.
That's his house. Okay? -Okay. Hold on.

1:29:42.001 --> 1:29:43.753
Settle down, now.
Settle down.

1:29:43.836 --> 1:29:46.631
Officer, I understand
that the bridge might be compromised

1:29:46.714 --> 1:29:47.965
but we need to get across.

1:29:48.049 --> 1:29:49.133
It's not safe to cross.

1:29:49.217 --> 1:29:51.052
A portion of the bridge
collapsed

1:29:51.135 --> 1:29:52.637
-in last night's storm.
-We have a wedding on the other side.

1:29:52.720 --> 1:29:55.181
I understand,
but it is not safe to cross.

1:29:55.264 --> 1:29:58.309
My life's work is in there.
Please, you need to let me go through.

1:29:58.393 --> 1:30:00.478
-Bridge collapsed
in last night's storm. -Kyler.

1:30:00.561 --> 1:30:02.271
-No one can cross.
It's very dangerous. -What happened?

1:30:02.355 --> 1:30:03.356
Give us your worst.

1:30:03.439 --> 1:30:05.733
Hey, Natalie.

1:30:05.817 --> 1:30:09.445
There are a couple
more palm fronds than we were bargaining for

1:30:09.529 --> 1:30:10.947
-What?
-...and their flowers...

1:30:11.030 --> 1:30:12.532
are not really looking
very good.

1:30:12.615 --> 1:30:15.326
No, no. But can we have
the wedding there?

1:30:15.409 --> 1:30:18.746
The wedding's not happening
here.

1:30:18.830 --> 1:30:21.290
We can't use
the venue. It's done.

1:30:21.374 --> 1:30:22.542
What are you talking about?

1:30:22.625 --> 1:30:24.252
It's over. It's done.

1:30:24.335 --> 1:30:27.380
The tent collapsed.
The wedding's over. I'm so sorry.

1:30:27.463 --> 1:30:28.589
She's right.

1:30:29.423 --> 1:30:30.842
It's over.

1:30:30.925 --> 1:30:33.553
We can get married some
other time. Some other place.

1:30:33.636 --> 1:30:35.012
Wait a second. Sofi.

1:30:35.096 --> 1:30:38.182
We just had a bridge collapse.
We had a storm.

1:30:38.266 --> 1:30:40.017
I mean, how many more signs
do we want?

1:30:40.101 --> 1:30:42.687
Okay. Don't panic, okay?
I got this.

1:30:42.770 --> 1:30:45.189
Let me call the Biltmore,
see if we can get in there.

1:30:45.273 --> 1:30:47.400
I'm done. I'm done.

1:30:48.484 --> 1:30:49.652
Give me a second.

1:30:52.029 --> 1:30:53.698
We'll get married another time.

1:30:54.782 --> 1:30:57.451
-When?
-I don't know.

1:30:57.535 --> 1:31:00.621
Biltmore Hotel.
How can I help you?

1:31:03.791 --> 1:31:04.876
Hello?

1:31:06.752 --> 1:31:07.545
Hello?

1:31:07.628 --> 1:31:08.880
Wait, hold on. Hold on.

1:31:08.963 --> 1:31:11.632
You never wanted a wedding
in a hotel.

1:31:11.716 --> 1:31:14.594
You wanted something unique,
something special.

1:31:14.677 --> 1:31:17.513
You wanted a beach or a barn.

1:31:17.597 --> 1:31:18.848
What about...

1:31:18.931 --> 1:31:20.266
What about our home?

1:31:23.019 --> 1:31:25.730
You never wanted a wedding
with 800 strangers.

1:31:28.065 --> 1:31:29.150
Right?

1:31:29.233 --> 1:31:31.611
So, this is your day.

1:31:33.070 --> 1:31:35.531
Take it as an opportunity

1:31:35.615 --> 1:31:37.617
to have the wedding
you always wanted.

1:31:39.994 --> 1:31:41.704
Let's have it at our home.

1:31:43.915 --> 1:31:45.082
Our home.

1:31:48.920 --> 1:31:50.421
-Let's do it! Let's do it!
-Yes!

1:31:50.504 --> 1:31:53.049
-Yes!
-Let's do it!

1:31:53.132 --> 1:31:55.843
Junior! Get Junior Jr.
and a text chain.

1:31:55.927 --> 1:31:57.803
Get everybody to bring
something by- 00.

1:31:57.887 --> 1:32:00.514
-I can't go back
to dog walking. -Hey.

1:32:00.598 --> 1:32:03.226
Oh. Pull yourself together.
What's the matter with you?

1:32:03.309 --> 1:32:05.186
You've done this
a million times.

1:32:05.269 --> 1:32:06.604
I'm not a wedding planner.

1:32:06.687 --> 1:32:07.772
What do you mean,
you're not a wedding planner?

1:32:07.855 --> 1:32:09.190
-I'm a fraud.
-What?

1:32:09.273 --> 1:32:10.733
You're more
than a wedding planner.

1:32:10.816 --> 1:32:12.902
I only interned for Becky Weisz
for three months.

1:32:12.985 --> 1:32:16.614
And by "interned,"
I mean, I picked her kid up from school.

1:32:16.697 --> 1:32:17.990
I picked up the wrong kid.

1:32:18.074 --> 1:32:20.409
They sent out an Amber Alert,
okay?

1:32:21.244 --> 1:32:22.954
I'm a joke.

1:32:23.037 --> 1:32:24.956
All right. All right,
all right. Enough of that, enough of that.

1:32:25.039 --> 1:32:26.999
You said yourself,
there's nothing you can't do with a phone.

1:32:27.083 --> 1:32:28.417
-Okay?
-Okay.

1:32:28.501 --> 1:32:29.794
You're a she-boss.

1:32:29.877 --> 1:32:32.505
We're gonna do this.
Just, what do we need?

1:32:34.924 --> 1:32:37.635
I could redirect
some flower trucks to the house.

1:32:37.718 --> 1:32:38.761
That's something.

1:32:38.844 --> 1:32:40.513
It'll be shabby more than chic.

1:32:40.596 --> 1:32:42.640
But I guess
we can make it work.

1:32:42.723 --> 1:32:44.141
Mami, call las tias...

1:32:44.225 --> 1:32:46.060
-and tell them
to start cooking now. -Go! Go!

1:32:46.143 --> 1:32:47.645
Where's Tío Walter?
Tío Walter!

1:32:47.728 --> 1:32:50.147
Yeah. Say no more.
Inmortales are back.

1:32:50.231 --> 1:32:51.649
Inmortales.

1:32:52.483 --> 1:32:54.235
Kyler, it's back on!

1:32:56.237 --> 1:32:58.155
-Let's go.
-Let's move.

1:32:59.615 --> 1:33:01.492
-Sofi, here.
-Thank you.

1:33:01.576 --> 1:33:04.495
-Wine, wine, wine.
-Cheese, cheese.

1:33:04.578 --> 1:33:05.788
Thank you.
Tortillas.

1:33:07.415 --> 1:33:09.000
-Thank you, Javie.
-Go, go, go.

1:33:09.083 --> 1:33:11.043
Cora, are you getting
the cakes?

1:33:11.127 --> 1:33:13.879
Uh. Yeah? Great.

1:33:13.963 --> 1:33:16.007
We're gonna need chips.
I almost crashed into you.

1:33:16.090 --> 1:33:18.509
It's fine!
Just basketball it.

1:33:18.592 --> 1:33:22.054
Hey, everybody.
Thanks for coming. Thanks for the support.

1:33:22.138 --> 1:33:24.265
We're gonna turn this house
into a wedding venue.

1:33:25.766 --> 1:33:27.435
Okay. So we're gonna need
to pool from the neighbors

1:33:27.518 --> 1:33:29.353
as many tables, chairs, plates,
and silverware as we can.

1:33:29.437 --> 1:33:31.230
Yeah, and, Antonio,
if you have any complaints,

1:33:31.314 --> 1:33:32.815
-just share that.
-Wait, no, no, no.

1:33:32.898 --> 1:33:34.525
I have an Uber code.
No one's bringing their car.

1:33:35.526 --> 1:33:36.694
What is that?

1:33:36.777 --> 1:33:38.195
The pig.

1:33:38.279 --> 1:33:40.656
Okay. Well, bring el cochino
to the back.

1:33:40.740 --> 1:33:42.283
Excuse us. Excuse us.

1:33:42.366 --> 1:33:43.743
-Come on, move it or lose it.
-Watch it. Coming through.

1:33:43.826 --> 1:33:45.077
-I'm sorry. Is that the cake?
-Careful.

1:33:45.161 --> 1:33:47.079
-Yep.
-Unfortunately.

1:33:47.163 --> 1:33:50.124
Could it match any less?
Jesus.

1:33:50.207 --> 1:33:51.667
Three-for-one.

1:33:51.751 --> 1:33:53.377
JoJo Siwa called.
She wants her wedding cake back.

1:33:53.461 --> 1:33:56.547
I got you. Here we go.
Nice and easy. Come through.

1:33:56.630 --> 1:33:58.341
Okay.
Hi, kids.

1:33:58.424 --> 1:34:00.968
Okay. We're gonna take
all the petals and put them in the bowl.

1:34:01.052 --> 1:34:02.470
Good. Just like that.
In the bowl.

1:34:02.553 --> 1:34:04.722
Great. In the bowl. Good.

1:34:07.058 --> 1:34:09.477
Okay. Ingrid,
I'm gonna set up the backyard,

1:34:09.560 --> 1:34:11.312
you look after the food.

1:34:11.395 --> 1:34:12.938
Okay. You know
they're gonna destroy the whole house, right?

1:34:13.022 --> 1:34:14.857
We'll remodel it later.

1:34:14.940 --> 1:34:18.736

200 people in four hours? Impossible!

1:34:18.819 --> 1:34:20.821
Ladies! How can we help?

1:34:20.905 --> 1:34:23.199
What can you make
in four hours?

1:34:23.282 --> 1:34:24.200
Mole.

1:34:24.283 --> 1:34:25.910
Yeah. Get in here. Sold.

1:34:25.993 --> 1:34:27.578
Mole and ropa vieja?

1:34:27.661 --> 1:34:28.788
Who the hell cares?

1:34:28.871 --> 1:34:30.581
-Marcela, do you cook?
-Sure, I do.

1:34:30.664 --> 1:34:32.249
Where's an apron?

1:34:32.333 --> 1:34:33.918
-In the drawer.
-Line the table up on the back patio.

1:34:35.336 --> 1:34:36.462
Careful.

1:34:36.545 --> 1:34:39.673
Has anyone heard
from the Zen guide?

1:34:39.757 --> 1:34:41.425
-Help us out here, guys.
We have this... -Here. Hold the end.

1:34:41.509 --> 1:34:43.094
-Right here. Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:34:44.553 --> 1:34:46.847
Send every case of champagne
you've got.

1:34:46.931 --> 1:34:49.850
And ten boxes of the best
Mexican cigars. Okay?

1:34:49.934 --> 1:34:52.478
Mexican cigars?
I can't wait.

1:34:54.355 --> 1:34:56.273
Oye, where's Julieta?

1:34:56.357 --> 1:34:57.525
She's sick from the shrimp.

1:34:57.608 --> 1:34:59.902
Time's running out. Let's go.

1:34:59.985 --> 1:35:01.237
Oh, my God. What happened?

1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:02.863
The bridge collapsed,
so I swam here.

1:35:02.947 --> 1:35:04.073
Well, don't make this
about you.

1:35:04.156 --> 1:35:05.408
-I'm sorry.
-Kyler!

1:35:05.491 --> 1:35:06.701
-I'm sorry. Yes, you're right.
-Hurry!

1:35:06.784 --> 1:35:07.827
I need your help.

1:35:07.910 --> 1:35:09.120
We got this.

1:35:11.122 --> 1:35:12.206
Here you go.

1:35:13.666 --> 1:35:16.168
Junior? How's that pig?

1:35:16.252 --> 1:35:18.379
-He's seen
better days. -Good.

1:35:24.385 --> 1:35:27.930
Tío, where are the rest
of Inmortales?

1:35:28.013 --> 1:35:29.306
They passed away.

1:35:31.392 --> 1:35:33.144
Play louder. Over here.

1:35:33.227 --> 1:35:34.645
Oye. Junior Jr.

1:35:36.021 --> 1:35:36.939
Put that down.

1:35:38.107 --> 1:35:39.442
And help me with the lechón.

1:35:39.525 --> 1:35:40.985
It's hot. Be careful. Ready?

1:35:42.153 --> 1:35:43.112
Okay.

1:35:44.613 --> 1:35:46.240
Watch my loafers.

1:35:46.323 --> 1:35:50.202
-Is this all you got?
Such a small pig? -Yes, Chi Chi.

1:35:50.286 --> 1:35:51.996
I hope you threw
some sour orange juice on it.

1:35:52.079 --> 1:35:53.789
-Yes, Chi Chi. Yes.
-I could have cooked it.

1:35:53.873 --> 1:35:55.541
Is the Herrera wedding here?

1:35:55.624 --> 1:35:56.834
Yes, the wedding is here.

1:35:56.917 --> 1:35:57.835
-Billy.
-Sí.

1:35:57.918 --> 1:35:58.878
Where do we put them?

1:36:01.297 --> 1:36:02.673
Hey, I got an idea.

1:36:02.756 --> 1:36:03.799
This way, gentlemen.

1:36:03.883 --> 1:36:05.217
Okay. Come on. Come on.

1:36:10.764 --> 1:36:14.643
All the way up!

1:36:14.727 --> 1:36:16.061
-Papi.
-Ready?

1:36:16.145 --> 1:36:17.396
Yes. And you?

1:36:18.606 --> 1:36:19.607
No.

1:36:21.817 --> 1:36:22.943
Watch your dress.

1:36:23.027 --> 1:36:24.069
Yeah.

1:36:27.406 --> 1:36:28.407
Okay.

1:36:38.501 --> 1:36:40.169
Let's go!

1:36:52.973 --> 1:36:54.558
What is she doing here?

1:36:54.642 --> 1:36:58.062
Adán's Zen teacher
couldn't make it because of the storm,

1:36:58.145 --> 1:37:00.356
so Natalie's officiating.

1:37:00.439 --> 1:37:02.900
I guess she is more than
just a wedding planner.

1:37:03.734 --> 1:37:05.277
God, I hope so.

1:37:08.155 --> 1:37:10.407
-Cora? Cora. Cora!
-Cora. Cora.

1:37:10.491 --> 1:37:12.076
Come here.

1:37:12.159 --> 1:37:13.410
Look at her sleeve.

1:37:13.494 --> 1:37:15.788
-Look at her sleeve.
-Oh, my God.

1:37:15.871 --> 1:37:18.290
Holy shit.
Take this.

1:37:18.374 --> 1:37:19.875
-Do you trust me?
-Yeah.

1:37:21.043 --> 1:37:22.127
Oh.

1:37:23.504 --> 1:37:26.465
There. Beautiful. Yes.
Great. Gorgeous.

1:37:26.549 --> 1:37:27.591
Good, thank you.

1:37:27.675 --> 1:37:28.759
-Looks good, looks good.
-You sure?

1:37:28.842 --> 1:37:30.386
Yeah.
Mamá.

1:37:30.469 --> 1:37:34.265
Don't worry, mi amor.
You look even more beautiful.

1:37:34.348 --> 1:37:36.267
-Help me with the veil.
-Yeah.

1:37:43.107 --> 1:37:45.359
-I'll be up front. Good luck.
-Thank you, Mom.

1:37:48.070 --> 1:37:49.154
Oye, Ingrid.

1:37:57.121 --> 1:37:58.998
No one could ever
give this girl away...

1:38:02.293 --> 1:38:03.961
but for the sake
of some old tradition,

1:38:04.044 --> 1:38:06.672
if someone's gonna have to
walk her down that aisle...

1:38:07.881 --> 1:38:10.175
then I want it to be
the both of us.

1:38:14.179 --> 1:38:15.347
Shall we?

1:38:20.394 --> 1:38:21.645
Yeah.

1:38:21.729 --> 1:38:22.730
Come.

1:38:26.525 --> 1:38:28.277
Damn you, Billy.

1:39:03.854 --> 1:39:05.022
Hola.

1:39:05.856 --> 1:39:07.524
Bonjour.

1:39:07.608 --> 1:39:10.361
Bienvenidos a this wedding.

1:39:12.529 --> 1:39:14.365
I would like you all
to use your mind's eye

1:39:14.448 --> 1:39:17.785
and visualize what this wedding
could have been.

1:39:19.453 --> 1:39:22.206
Custom crystal chandeliers,

1:39:22.289 --> 1:39:25.042
synchronized flamingos
dancing in a fountain

1:39:25.125 --> 1:39:29.254
and a build-your-own
blini-blintz bar that was

1:39:30.297 --> 1:39:32.174
truly so beautiful.

1:39:34.468 --> 1:39:37.388
But things don't always go
as planned...

1:39:37.471 --> 1:39:40.224
in life, or in love.

1:39:40.307 --> 1:39:45.646
And sometimes, when your plans
crumble and crash...

1:39:45.729 --> 1:39:48.232
life surprises you...

1:39:48.315 --> 1:39:51.568
and gives you a moment
more perfect...

1:39:51.652 --> 1:39:53.612
than one that
you could ever imagine.

1:39:55.364 --> 1:39:57.866
So, trust, surrender...

1:39:57.950 --> 1:40:02.204
and a little love from your fam
is truly all that you need.

1:40:03.497 --> 1:40:05.374
And now...

1:40:05.457 --> 1:40:09.253
do you, Sofi Herrera Castillo,
take this man to be your wedded husband?

1:40:10.337 --> 1:40:12.172
I do.

1:40:12.256 --> 1:40:14.425
And do you,
Adán Castillo Herrera...

1:40:14.508 --> 1:40:16.927
take this woman
to be your wedded wife?

1:40:17.010 --> 1:40:17.928
I do.

1:40:19.805 --> 1:40:21.432
He took your last name?

1:40:21.515 --> 1:40:23.892
And now,
under the eye of God,

1:40:23.976 --> 1:40:26.437
and surrounded
by your loving family...

1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:28.564
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1:40:28.647 --> 1:40:30.315
You may now kiss the bride.

1:41:28.624 --> 1:41:30.083
Cuban?

1:41:30.167 --> 1:41:31.251
Pre-Castro.

1:41:42.429 --> 1:41:43.680
It's good.

1:41:49.436 --> 1:41:50.562
You know, Billy...

1:41:51.730 --> 1:41:53.148
every summer my buddies
and I

1:41:53.232 --> 1:41:56.902
take a big fishing trip
in the Sea of Cortez.

1:41:58.403 --> 1:42:01.240
You know, cigars,
tequila, mezcal.

1:42:02.699 --> 1:42:04.785
I think you'd enjoy it.

1:42:05.953 --> 1:42:09.122
Plus,
Adán doesn't like fishing.

1:42:09.873 --> 1:42:10.999
Or boxing.

1:42:11.083 --> 1:42:12.125
Soccer.

1:42:12.209 --> 1:42:13.293
Or baseball.

1:42:13.377 --> 1:42:14.962
Or strippers.

1:42:16.713 --> 1:42:18.757
Where did I go wrong
with that kid?

1:42:20.050 --> 1:42:21.635
To be perfectly honest...

1:42:22.678 --> 1:42:24.388
I can't think of a place.

1:42:47.494 --> 1:42:49.288
I'd like to propose a toast.

1:42:51.582 --> 1:42:53.792
Not yet, I have a lot of things
to say.

1:42:57.129 --> 1:43:00.591
I came to this country
with nothing.

1:43:03.635 --> 1:43:05.762
On a raft...

1:43:05.846 --> 1:43:09.099
in the middle of a hurricane,
surrounded by sharks.

1:43:09.182 --> 1:43:11.727
-Oh.

1:43:11.810 --> 1:43:16.523
All kidding aside,
to my beautiful Sofi.

1:43:16.607 --> 1:43:19.067
When you told me
that you were moving to Mexico,

1:43:19.151 --> 1:43:21.987
I feared that all our efforts
coming into this country

1:43:22.070 --> 1:43:26.116
to wanting to strive
and to do better were gonna disappear.

1:43:26.199 --> 1:43:28.911
That our family traditions
were gonna disappear.

1:43:30.370 --> 1:43:32.289
Things have been
coming at me...

1:43:33.624 --> 1:43:35.083
very fast...

1:43:35.167 --> 1:43:37.336
and it's been a struggle
for me to keep up.

1:43:37.419 --> 1:43:41.632
But when I realized
the kind of life that you wanted to build...

1:43:41.715 --> 1:43:45.385
I started to learn that
it's time for me to let go of my past

1:43:45.469 --> 1:43:49.222
and embrace the future.

1:43:49.306 --> 1:43:54.645
And that fills me
with so much excitement and joy and pride...

1:43:54.728 --> 1:43:57.022
for the kind of person
you wanna be.

1:43:59.858 --> 1:44:01.485
To Adán.

1:44:01.568 --> 1:44:04.363
You came to my house
and you said, "I wanna be like Sofi."

1:44:04.446 --> 1:44:06.740
And now,
I just wanna be like you.

1:44:10.494 --> 1:44:12.496
I'm blessed to have you
in my life.

1:44:17.793 --> 1:44:19.419
And to my dear Ingrid.

1:44:21.505 --> 1:44:24.466
I shouldn't have taken
this long to say this...

1:44:24.549 --> 1:44:27.469
but you know how proud I am
of all the houses that I've built...

1:44:27.552 --> 1:44:29.554
but the only one
that truly matters...

1:44:32.015 --> 1:44:34.351
is the home that you have
built.

1:44:35.227 --> 1:44:36.812
And I thank you for that.

1:44:39.106 --> 1:44:40.649
And I love you madly.

1:44:44.277 --> 1:44:48.615
So, I humbly ask for all of you
to forgive...

1:44:48.699 --> 1:44:51.284
this stubborn, old...

1:44:52.077 --> 1:44:55.622
proud Cuban man...

1:44:55.706 --> 1:44:59.710
for taking so long
to realize these simple things.

1:44:59.793 --> 1:45:02.713
Let's raise a glass
to Adán and Sofi...

1:45:02.796 --> 1:45:06.008
wish 'em the best of luck
and much love.

1:45:06.091 --> 1:45:07.384
To the bride and groom.

1:45:07.467 --> 1:45:09.928
To the bride and groom.

1:45:35.829 --> 1:45:38.999
-Having eyes.
-To having eyes.

1:45:39.082 --> 1:45:42.753
-Oh, my gosh, here he is.
-How you doing, girls?

1:45:42.836 --> 1:45:44.713
-Good. How are you?
-I'm good.

1:45:44.796 --> 1:45:46.882
-Nice speech.
-You liked it?

1:45:46.965 --> 1:45:51.219
I thought the speech
was a little corny. Get over yourself, dude.

1:45:51.303 --> 1:45:52.804
-Okay.
-Hold on.

1:45:53.513 --> 1:45:54.681
I like her.

1:45:57.059 --> 1:45:58.351
Hey.

1:46:00.187 --> 1:46:02.898
You've always had your way
of doing things...

1:46:02.981 --> 1:46:04.483
and I've always had mine.

1:46:06.109 --> 1:46:07.444
But after seeing
how you designed

1:46:07.527 --> 1:46:09.112
these dresses for this wedding,

1:46:09.196 --> 1:46:11.239
if you wanna
start your own business...

1:46:12.407 --> 1:46:13.450
I got your back.

1:46:17.329 --> 1:46:18.580
Thank you, papi.

1:46:18.663 --> 1:46:21.291
-Whoo!

1:46:21.375 --> 1:46:22.501
And I'm very proud of you.

1:46:22.584 --> 1:46:23.794
Proud of you too.

1:47:38.785 --> 1:47:40.495
You got your unique wedding.

1:47:41.663 --> 1:47:43.123
I'm gonna miss you, Dad.

1:47:50.672 --> 1:47:53.258
I see you chose our song
for your dance.

1:47:54.885 --> 1:47:56.803
Yes.

1:47:56.887 --> 1:47:59.181
Except, I didn't choose it
for us.

1:48:10.567 --> 1:48:11.568
Bravo!

1:48:29.878 --> 1:48:32.088
Where are we, Billy?

1:48:32.172 --> 1:48:33.632
What are we doing?

1:48:36.635 --> 1:48:37.969
Let's go to Greece.

1:48:38.053 --> 1:48:40.096
What?

1:48:40.180 --> 1:48:43.600
Well, if you're gonna dump me,
why not go out with a bang?

1:48:43.683 --> 1:48:44.976
Oh.

1:48:45.685 --> 1:48:46.770
True.

1:48:54.903 --> 1:48:56.613
So, what are the ground rules?

1:48:57.739 --> 1:48:58.782
Hm.

1:49:00.367 --> 1:49:01.701
Can we hold hands?

1:49:03.703 --> 1:49:04.746
Yes.

1:49:04.829 --> 1:49:06.039
Can we dance?

1:49:07.582 --> 1:49:08.833
I think we're doing that.

1:49:08.917 --> 1:49:10.043
Can we kiss?
