Hey, Dad.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.757
What? What you all want?

02:12.049 --> 02:14.468
Dad, I wrote up a little proposal
this morning.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.304
- Like a contract.
- Contract?

02:17.888 --> 02:19.431
You let us continue to perform,

02:19.514 --> 02:21.350
and we promise to come straight home.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.894
And not miss school, do our chores,

02:23.977 --> 02:26.980
look after each other, stay out of trouble
and away from drugs. And, Daddy,

02:27.064 --> 02:29.483
if we fail to live up
to any part of this contract...

02:30.525 --> 02:31.693
we'll never perform again.

02:32.361 --> 02:34.196
See? It says that there on page three.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.197
Page three, huh?

02:37.366 --> 02:38.659
Let me ask you something.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.913
Did I beat your asses last night
or did I show rare mercy and restraint?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.164
Rare mercy and restraint.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.874
Correct. And yet despite my mercy,

02:45.957 --> 02:48.794
y'all got the nerve to come into
my kitchen to wheel and deal?

02:48.877 --> 02:50.253
We really love music, Dad...

02:50.837 --> 02:52.130
just like you. And our crew?

02:52.214 --> 02:53.632
We're going places.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.050
We're good at it.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.260
And girls are starting to like us now,
Dad.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.181
You boys ain't selling drugs?

03:02.140 --> 03:04.976
- No, no, no way, Dad.
- Dad, just look at Article 1.

03:05.060 --> 03:08.105
Your devoted musical offspring
will never ever sell drugs, period.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.856
- What about Dizzee?
- He's not.

03:09.940 --> 03:10.774
I swear.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.026
I keep an eye on Dizzee all the time,
right, Boo?

03:13.110 --> 03:14.277
Mm. Mm-hm.

03:14.986 --> 03:15.821
He does.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.823
Ra-Ra's like 5-0.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.117
Really.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.576
Go to school.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.079
So, you'll take a look at it, then?

03:24.162 --> 03:24.996
Just...

03:27.582 --> 03:28.875
Go to school. Go.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.259
Devoted musical offspring, huh?

03:42.097 --> 03:43.932
Trust me. My daddy's gonna go for it.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.058
Not my <i>Tia</i> Wanda.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.476
Till I apologize to Gunns,

03:46.560 --> 03:48.854
I'm grounded, curfew and everything.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.106
I don't know if I feel like
apologizing to that asshole.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.651
I ain't trying to be played
like Papa Fuerte. No way.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.528
But a curfew won't do.
What about our shows?

03:57.195 --> 03:58.196
What's happening, man?

03:58.780 --> 04:00.532
Zeke, man, you the head MC.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.661
And as your manager, I'm telling you,
I have aggressive plans for expansion.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.538
So, yo, even if you ain't sorry,

04:07.080 --> 04:10.459
you have to march your ass to Queens
today and go apologize to this dude.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.712
I... I know you don't want to, but...
but for the music.

04:14.671 --> 04:18.216
Maybe... when you say you're sorry,
you could just...

04:18.759 --> 04:20.886
cross your fingers behind your back,
like they do.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.846
Use techniques the white man taught you.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.772
- Damn.
- Yo, Ezekiel is

04:31.855 --> 04:35.025
- so fine and intelligent.
- I don't know.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.401
- I like the soulful one.
- Yeah.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.362
Y'all should come to our show.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.740
- I'm Yvonne.
- I'm Tanya.

04:42.324 --> 04:44.242
We new here. And we Zulu queens.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.286
Walking the path of righteousness.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.955
Well, I'm enchanted to make
your most divine,

04:49.039 --> 04:50.165
foxy acquaintances.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.626
I'm Ra-Ra.

04:53.502 --> 04:54.920
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Ezekiel.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.004
I know who you are.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.340
That's my number at the top.
And that's hers.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.383
I appreciate the offer.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.261
And you fine, girl,
but I already go with somebody.

05:03.804 --> 05:04.971
You do, but do she?

05:07.974 --> 05:11.978
I, for one, refuse to disappoint
our rapidly growing fan base, Zeke.

05:12.562 --> 05:13.438
I'm just saying.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.488
<i> Drugs, crime, urban decay.</i>

05:22.030 --> 05:24.991
<i>These are intractable problems
facing our city.</i>

05:25.534 --> 05:27.661
<i>As Robert Moses himself once said:</i>

05:27.744 --> 05:30.455
<i>"I raise my stein to the builder
who can remove ghettos</i>

05:30.539 --> 05:32.040
<i>without removing people,</i>

05:32.123 --> 05:35.836
<i>as I hail the chef who can make omelets
without breaking eggs."</i>

05:37.045 --> 05:38.380
<i>But break the egg...</i>

05:39.047 --> 05:40.215
<i>and you create life.</i>

05:40.298 --> 05:41.466
<i>A new beginning.</i>

05:41.758 --> 05:42.759
<i>Take, for example...</i>

05:43.176 --> 05:44.135
The Unisphere.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.721
Designed by my pal Gil Clarke,

05:46.805 --> 05:49.140
and commissioned for the '64 World's Fair,

05:49.224 --> 05:50.267
by whom?

05:51.476 --> 05:52.602
Robert Moses.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.979
My great mentor, yes.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.398
You know, back in the 1930s,
this entire vista,

05:56.982 --> 05:58.900
this gorgeous expanse,

05:58.984 --> 06:00.610
it was an irreparable wasteland.

06:00.694 --> 06:04.155
Fitzgerald dubbed it a "valley of ashes"
in <i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

06:05.448 --> 06:07.576
But where Fitzgerald saw only ruin...

06:08.201 --> 06:10.620
Moses saw unbridled potential.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.415
And I still see potential in you, Ezekiel.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.500
- You do?
- Make no mistake...

06:15.750 --> 06:19.546
you committed an unforgivable offense
the other night at the Ivy Social Club.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.299
The victim's father's been
a good friend to the mayor.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.301
But fortunately for you,

06:24.384 --> 06:27.512
I'm a man in ample possession
of the power to broker absolution.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.598
The only question is,

06:29.681 --> 06:32.267
will you do what's necessary
to earn my largesse?

06:36.521 --> 06:39.149
Mr. Gunns,
I wanna apologize for what happened.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.068
You've given me encouragement
and wisdom and a helping hand,

06:42.152 --> 06:45.238
and I just want you to know that
what they're saying about me is not true.

06:45.322 --> 06:48.450
I did not pull a gun on Chips Henderson
and definitely didn't rob him.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.367
I know.

06:49.826 --> 06:50.994
- You do?
- Mm-hm.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.662
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.830
But there was a gun.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.082
And it belonged to a friend of yours.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.127
A street tough disguised as a waiter
selling drugs?

06:59.210 --> 07:00.920
- Mr. Gunns, I can explain.
- No need.

07:01.004 --> 07:01.880
None at all.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.884
I'll need the name of the boy.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.553
Ed needs to hold someone responsible,
publicly.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.138
I can't do that, he's my friend.

07:10.221 --> 07:12.140
- My best friend.
- He's your worst enemy.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.352
And now...
And I know this is difficult for you...

07:16.394 --> 07:18.063
but he's become your litmus test.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.649
Will you throw away your future

07:20.732 --> 07:23.234
to save a gun-toting ghetto thug

07:23.818 --> 07:25.904
whom we both know has no future?

07:26.529 --> 07:28.823
Did he even have
the slightest consideration

07:28.907 --> 07:31.451
for your future when he pulled that gun
on Chips Henderson?

07:36.414 --> 07:38.625
You right. I know that.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.463
- Tell me his name.
- I can't.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.799
Well, you will.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.802
I warned you this day would come, Ezekiel.
Didn't I?

07:49.928 --> 07:52.097
Don't bite the only hand feeding you.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.433
I'm sorry.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.978
I don't need this. And I don't need you.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.605
I got another hand feeding me,
it's my music.

08:00.689 --> 08:05.860
Music? Sure. Why not become
an astronaut while you're at it?

08:05.944 --> 08:09.280
- Or play second base for the Yankees.
- I don't expect you to understand.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.949
If you're expecting to waltz in

08:11.032 --> 08:13.827
and become the next grand concert pianist,
be advised,

08:14.077 --> 08:16.538
there is no affirmative action
at Carnegie Hall.

08:16.621 --> 08:17.956
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.500
You're not just gonna lose
the internship and Yale.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.377
There will be repercussions.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.130
This incident will follow you
wherever you go.

08:25.213 --> 08:29.134
And the repercussions for Francisco Cruz
in the Bronx will be immediate.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.635
Is that what you want?

08:33.138 --> 08:35.682
I can't control what you do.
Only what I do.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.476
And I stay loyal to my people.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.770
Unlike you, Mr. Gunns.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.523
You know, I learned a lot from you.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.108
Just like you learned from Mr. Moses.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.402
Thank you.

08:48.695 --> 08:53.116
Oh, and, uh, for the record,
you and him are a lot alike.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.201
You both have big visions for the city...

08:55.869 --> 08:59.664
but, yo,
the ends don't always justify the means.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here

09:12.052 --> 09:13.636
- Oh, my God.
- What?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.096
I love weed.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.059
- How you feeling?
- I don't know.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.895
<i>Papi </i> had me singing for hours
in the new church today,

09:21.978 --> 09:24.064
- but I'm trying to stay positive.
- Mm.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.483
Speaking of which, have you spoken to Roy?

09:28.234 --> 09:31.821
Uh, no.
I mean, I left another message, but <i>nada.</i>

09:32.405 --> 09:33.782
'Cause I was talking to Shane.

09:33.865 --> 09:36.409
I thought I'd see why
the label's throwing you shade.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.453
Regina, you just went and talked to Shane?

09:38.536 --> 09:39.579
What? He's...

09:39.662 --> 09:41.915
He's got a little crush on me,
so I thought I'd capitalize

09:41.998 --> 09:44.626
and get the scoop on why
they ain't pick up the phone.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.961
Well, shit, what'd he say?

09:47.295 --> 09:48.505
Between me and you,

09:48.713 --> 09:52.926
I think they're trying to figure out
if you're still their disco star or not.

09:53.468 --> 09:54.594
Are you being serious?

09:54.677 --> 09:56.805
Personally, Mylene, I blame your father.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.724
You being so fucking intense.
You need to hit that joint.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.936
It's just, I think it's good
to keep the momentum up

10:03.019 --> 10:04.854
and not let your <i>papi </i> limit us.

10:04.938 --> 10:08.024
I'm not gonna let these opportunities
pass me by 'cause of him.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.151
None of us should. Especially you, Mylene.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.654
Because you got a real fucking shot here.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.251
We need to talk.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.253
How did your meeting go?

10:29.879 --> 10:30.713
Uh...

10:30.797 --> 10:31.714
Pretty good.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.259
Francisco called.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.970
He said you cursed out Mr. Gunns.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.474
- 'Cause he's racist.
- Oh, Lord.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.852
- Sit down, Ezekiel.
- Can't right now. I got a gig.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.812
You also got a curfew.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.315
- I know, but...
- Sit down.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.484
I can't right now.
After the gig, I promise...

10:51.568 --> 10:52.944
Sit your ass down!

10:53.027 --> 10:53.862
I can't.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.990
I'm bringing in money.
I'm putting food in the fridge.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.492
Plus the Con Ed bill,
I paid that on my way home.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.578
All from making music.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.538
You're lying. I know you're lying.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.624
- I know you're selling drugs.
- Nah, I'm a musician.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.419
Hey, look here, son.
Now, I ain't saying you pushing dope.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.255
I can't call what you're doing
out in the streets,

11:12.338 --> 11:13.590
but we are telling you...

11:14.173 --> 11:15.258
you have a curfew.

11:15.758 --> 11:19.762
So, don't make your Aunt Wanda have to
tell you to sit your ass the fuck down.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.097
I can't. Not now.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.225
After the gig, I'll come straight home,
but right now, I gotta go.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.270
What, you gonna beat me?
Gonna chain me to the radiator?

11:27.353 --> 11:29.898
I'll find a way out. I'm gonna be an MC
whether you like it or not.

11:29.981 --> 11:30.815
Over my dead body.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.775
- Come at me then. Come at me.
- Stop. Stop!

11:33.443 --> 11:36.988
Ezekiel Figuero, I love you.

11:38.072 --> 11:41.159
And Lord knows that I am proud
and fond of you.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.578
I think of you as my own son.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.039
But listen to me.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.583
You leave this house tonight...

11:50.335 --> 11:51.419
don't come back.

11:52.086 --> 11:52.921
Ever.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.506
Do I make myself clear?

11:59.218 --> 12:00.053
Yeah.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.221
I understand.

12:03.306 --> 12:04.140
Yeah.

12:19.030 --> 12:19.948
I love you, too.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.330
You just remember one more thing, boy.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.334
- Pride cometh before the fall, son...
- Fuck yourself!

12:34.420 --> 12:36.756
Pride cometh before the fall.

Yo! Yo, you really broke out today, Books.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.802
- For real.
- That's one way of putting it.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.805
I'm proud of you, B,
spreading your wings and shit.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.974
How about tomorrow we take some money,

14:10.058 --> 14:12.560
hit the hardware store
and do this place up right?

14:13.144 --> 14:15.813
Of course, you stay here
as long as you want, brother.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.023
Yeah, how about forever?

14:17.106 --> 14:18.316
It's cool with me.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.696
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:23.780 --> 14:24.614
I'm just...

14:25.198 --> 14:28.368
thinking about this thing Leon said
about pride before the fall.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.453
- Wondering if you did the right thing?
- Nah,

14:30.536 --> 14:32.413
- I know I did.
- Cool.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.625
What about that college shit?

14:35.708 --> 14:37.502
Ahh, I squashed that. I ain't going.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.253
Okay, good. So, I did you a favor.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.924
Crashing that cracker college event shit.

14:43.007 --> 14:46.886
Nah, man, just 'cause it worked out right
don't mean you wasn't wrong.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.847
- Who you calling wrong, B?
- I'm calling you wrong.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.059
And if I'm ever wrong, which,
you know, I doubt I will be,

14:53.142 --> 14:55.645
but if I'm ever wrong,
I want you to tell me.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.688
That's what partners are for, right?

14:58.773 --> 14:59.649
Yeah, you right.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.610
From now on, we're living for the music.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.197
What about your girl?

15:06.280 --> 15:09.242
- What's she gonna say about that?
- Shit.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.745
Hey, at least you got a place
to bring her back to, right?

15:12.829 --> 15:13.871
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.499
- Yeah, yeah.
- Cool out, man.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.876
All right, B. I'll let you rest.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.173
Just remember,
you in the streets now, Books.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.134
- You got it?
- I got it.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.051

17:07.026 --> 17:08.236
Somebody here.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.946
- Who the fuck is it?
- I'm about to find out.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.699
Ezekiel Figuero!

17:13.782 --> 17:15.992
I spoke to your aunt
and I know you're in there!

17:16.077 --> 17:17.619
- It's Papa Fuerte. Don't answer it.
- Open this door!

17:17.703 --> 17:19.204
- Shao, they after you.
- Go home!

17:19.288 --> 17:20.998
- Open the door!
- Nobody's here.

17:21.082 --> 17:25.086
- Shao. They're after both of us.
- Yo, you old Puerto Rican faggot!

17:25.169 --> 17:26.462
Go away!

17:27.296 --> 17:28.548
Oh, shit!

17:28.756 --> 17:31.884
Who called me an old Puerto Rican faggot?
That was you?

17:31.968 --> 17:33.010
What you gonna do about it?

17:33.094 --> 17:35.221

17:46.065 --> 17:47.525
<i>¡Yo soy un diablo!</i>

17:47.608 --> 17:50.319
- What's he talking about?
- You don't wanna know. Just back off.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.948
And as for you, you were supposed to
go to Gunns to apologize to him.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.242
And instead you tell him
to go fuck himself?

17:56.325 --> 17:58.494
- Not in those exact words.
- Oh, not in those words?

17:58.578 --> 18:00.663
You're a comedian, too?
Listen to these words.

18:00.746 --> 18:04.250
Number one, you are forbidden
to see Mylene ever again.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.459
- I can explain...
- No, no.

18:05.543 --> 18:09.130
No, you don't need to explain nothing,
because I know who you are.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.340
You're a waste of intelligence
and ability.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.009
That's who you are. You're a fake.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.053
You act like you want something better...

18:16.721 --> 18:20.141
but then somebody goes to bat for you
and what happens?

18:20.224 --> 18:21.309
You turn around and then

18:21.392 --> 18:23.728
you show your true colors
with all of this here.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.646
With the beer and the marijuana

18:25.730 --> 18:28.149
and your no-good-piece-of-shit
drug-dealing friend.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.817
You don't wanna improve yourself.

18:29.942 --> 18:30.901
You wanna get high

18:30.985 --> 18:32.820
and make noise with scratchy records

18:32.903 --> 18:36.198
and hickory-dickory-dockity nursery rhymes
that don't say shit!

18:37.658 --> 18:39.243
I gave you a chance!

18:41.120 --> 18:43.039
I gave you a chance and you screwed me...

18:43.122 --> 18:45.041
I didn't screw you. How did I screw you?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.042
Gunns!

18:46.250 --> 18:48.753
That's my partner!
That's... That's... That's my friend!

18:48.836 --> 18:51.005
- He ain't your friend!
- Excuse me?

18:51.088 --> 18:52.757
I'm sor... I'm sorry if I did you wrong,

18:52.840 --> 18:54.550
but Gunns ain't your friend
or your partner.

18:54.634 --> 18:58.095
I heard Gunns and the mayor got no
intention of letting you build anything.

18:58.179 --> 19:00.014
They're getting ready to dump your ass.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.265
<i>No empieces con mentiras aquí.</i>

19:01.349 --> 19:04.393
I'm not lying, sir. I wish I was.
I wish I was.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.188
I heard a bunch of kids talking
at the Yale Club. Shao heard it, too.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.441
Even his daughter, Claudia,
she told me her father just uses people.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.152
That he calls you "the arrogant spic"
behind your back.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.862
Gunns is a devil, Papa Fuerte.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.406
He's about to cut you loose.

19:19.533 --> 19:24.622
I would've told you sooner, but I w...
I was scared, and I'm sorry about that.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.083
Okay.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.296
You both heard what you heard.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.467
But that's just politics.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.512
My houses will be built.

19:39.804 --> 19:40.763
Believe me.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.765
These boys downtown, they just...

19:43.349 --> 19:45.309
They play games, you know?

19:45.810 --> 19:46.727
But don't you worry.

19:46.811 --> 19:49.772
- Papa Fuerte can play some games, too.
- Yeah, I know you can.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.190
Okay.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.152
You and me, we're not finished here.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.571
We'll discuss later.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.824
Sorry for the disturbance.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.368
I'm sorry you fucked with
the Get Down Brothers.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.285
Shao.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.750
Go buy yourself a new door.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.839
Why you gotta say some shit, man?

20:14.922 --> 20:17.800
Walking up in my place
like you own this shit.

20:21.679 --> 20:24.348
Hi, my angels.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.894
I won't be home for dinner.
I have a meeting with Councilman Herrara,

20:28.978 --> 20:30.020
then the zoning board,

20:30.104 --> 20:33.399
and then the fundraiser for our
sister church in Patterson, New Jersey.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.152
After which,
I'll be meeting with Minister Ruiz

20:36.235 --> 20:39.864
to talk about his plan for broadcasting
<i>Holy Ghost Radio</i> from our very own church,

20:39.947 --> 20:42.116
featuring Mylene Cruz
and the Soul Madonnas.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.284
Of course!

20:43.367 --> 20:45.536
Ah! Jehovah will bless you for this work.

20:45.619 --> 20:46.746
Okay.

20:46.829 --> 20:47.663
Wish me luck!

20:49.123 --> 20:51.208
What's bothering you?

20:52.084 --> 20:55.004
I haven't heard from Roy or Shane
since that day at the church.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.922
Are you sure neither of them have called?

20:57.006 --> 20:59.550
Not that I know of. Have you called them?

21:00.217 --> 21:03.471
Yeah, I called them a couple days ago
and they haven't called me back.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.931
- Let me get my purse.
- For what?

21:06.015 --> 21:07.433
I'll take you to see Roy.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.478
I can't just go down there
without an appointment.

21:10.561 --> 21:11.604
Listen to me.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.523
In this life, if you want something,
you have to pursue it.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.650
You can't just rely on life to pursue you.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.278
Or on your father to compromise.

21:19.570 --> 21:20.696

21:20.780 --> 21:22.114

So, what, you a DJ now, Annie?

21:39.465 --> 21:42.301
You ever heard of Dewey "Pigmeat" Markham?

21:42.843 --> 21:47.389
- Nah. But this beat is funky, though.
- Ain't nothing new under the sun, honey.

21:47.473 --> 21:53.729
Mr. Markham was rapping to that there beat
at the Apollo before you were ever born.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.898
And now this shit is coming back around.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.691
Shit always comes back around,

21:57.775 --> 21:59.360
especially with black folks.

21:59.693 --> 22:03.531
From Cab Calloway to Ali, to you, sugar.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.199
You ask for me, Ma?

22:05.491 --> 22:08.369
I asked for you both because...

22:08.452 --> 22:12.164
I want you to cut a record together.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.918
- A record? Like a Get Down record?
- Together?

22:16.001 --> 22:18.379
- 'Cause that ain't a thing.
- Yeah, it ain't a thing.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.713
Well, it can be.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.257
A novelty record.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.260
Super High Voltage presents:

22:24.468 --> 22:27.847
Shaolin Fantastic
and the Get Down Brothers.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.474
- What?
- What I saw the other night, Shao...

22:31.225 --> 22:33.102
- was an epiphany.
- No.

22:33.185 --> 22:37.690
No, Ma.
My label is known for good music.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.733
We make sophisticated

22:39.817 --> 22:43.779
disco music for motherfuckers
with good taste in music.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.739
But you ain't making no money, Clarence.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.617
And I heard that "Disco Biscuit" bullshit.

22:49.702 --> 22:50.869
You hear of "Pigmeat" Markham?

22:50.953 --> 22:52.580
He broke the Top 20.

22:52.663 --> 22:56.125
And went on to perform the same routine
for the next 20 years.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.167
Fuck "Pigmeat."

22:57.251 --> 22:59.962
That's a novelty.
And novelty records make money.

23:00.170 --> 23:04.758
Money. Money.
Ma, it'll ruin my reputation.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.510
Fuck your reputation, Clarence.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.429
This could be my retirement fund.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.516
So, what do you say, sugar?

23:12.600 --> 23:15.519
You and your boys ready to get paid?

Took a lot of courage to come down here 
unannounced on your own.

23:42.630 --> 23:44.673
So, what can we do for you, Mylene?

23:47.259 --> 23:50.596
I haven't heard from either of you
since Jackie played you his new song.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.683
Why?
What, you didn't like it, or you just...

23:55.434 --> 23:58.520
- like, trying to get rid of me?
- Mylene, you know me better than that.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.272
But I'm talking to Roy. What?

24:00.356 --> 24:03.525
You dumping me or something?
'Cause I don't know what I did wrong.

24:03.609 --> 24:04.443
- Mylene...
- Shane.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.696
Why don't you give me and Mylene
a little privacy here?

24:07.780 --> 24:10.866
- But, Roy...
- Shane, just do it, please.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.623
I need a bong hit.

24:18.207 --> 24:19.333
You mind?

24:27.883 --> 24:28.717
Okay.

24:30.844 --> 24:31.845
Sorry, but...

24:32.429 --> 24:34.139
- yes, I'm dumping you.
- Why?!

24:34.640 --> 24:35.641
This is hard for me, too.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.851
- But you're making a mistake, Roy.
- Am I?

24:37.935 --> 24:38.769
Yeah.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.896
'Cause I'm great.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.691
You know, I'm young. I'm fine. I'm built,

24:43.774 --> 24:45.651
and I sing better than everyone
on your label,

24:45.734 --> 24:48.445
- including fucking Misty Holloway.
- I don't disagree.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.197
What's your fucking problem, then?

24:50.280 --> 24:51.573
I made up my mind.

24:52.282 --> 24:54.243
Yeah... okay.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.577
Well, that's your loss.

24:55.661 --> 24:59.206
See, I'm gonna be a star
with or without you.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.124
No, you're not.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.500
I make stars.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.460
I know stars.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.629
I'm a fucking star myself.

25:05.713 --> 25:08.382
My parents wanted me to be a doctor.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.299
I defied them.

25:10.092 --> 25:12.261
I started this company
with an old tape recorder

25:12.344 --> 25:14.638
and a $50 savings bond
from my bar mitzvah.

25:14.722 --> 25:16.056
I'm a multi-millionaire now.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.224
And to this day,

25:17.307 --> 25:19.810
my parents don't speak to me, Mylene.

25:20.394 --> 25:21.395
Ever.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.354
Okay?

25:22.438 --> 25:24.606
Marlon Brando left Nebraska.

25:24.690 --> 25:27.526
Marilyn left wherever the fuck
she came from.

25:27.609 --> 25:30.070
Even the Bee Gees left fucking Australia,

25:30.154 --> 25:33.198
but you, Mylene,
you're never gonna leave your family.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.993
You're never gonna give yourself
the chance to become

25:36.076 --> 25:38.412
the kind of star
you have the potential to be.

25:38.495 --> 25:43.333
Because you lack the kind of raw, intense,
naked ambition

25:43.417 --> 25:47.087
that hurts and wounds
and stabs and scalds.

25:47.171 --> 25:51.842
My ex has it. Donna has it.
Irene Cara has it.

25:51.925 --> 25:52.843
You don't.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.095
You're useless to me without it.

25:55.179 --> 25:57.347
I don't need another
one-hit, two-hit wonder.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.600
I'm in the business of stars.

26:00.976 --> 26:04.855
So, you're gonna pay the Get Down Brothers
1500 each, cash upfront,

26:04.938 --> 26:06.064
and it'll be our record?

26:06.607 --> 26:09.359
Like, legit? Like, forever?

26:09.443 --> 26:10.277
No bullshit?

26:10.360 --> 26:12.029
That's what the contracts are for.

26:12.112 --> 26:14.573
You take this contract,
show it to your friends...

26:15.157 --> 26:16.116
and then you'll see.

26:17.659 --> 26:21.246
- This all sounds really nice, Annie.
- No, it don't.

26:21.330 --> 26:25.042
But, Annie, how you plan on making
a record using other people's records?

26:26.168 --> 26:27.377
Reach in there, sugar.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.716
Go on. Now, don't you worry
about how Mama gonna make it.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.928
You take that money,
you spend it on your friends...

26:37.304 --> 26:39.515
...you tell them there's more
to come the moment they sign.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.309
And just leave the rest up to me.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.395
Ain't that right, Clarence?

26:46.814 --> 26:49.191
I mean, I had a plan for you.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.484
Even now, this week,

26:50.567 --> 26:52.569
there's something big, very big.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.780
And now I'm fucked
because you can't handle it.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.990
- Your parents would never allow it.
- But what is it?

26:57.908 --> 26:59.201
Old pal of mine.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.286
Legendary film producer's in town.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.412
Robert Stigwood.

27:02.579 --> 27:03.413
Heard of him?

27:03.497 --> 27:06.834
<i>Saturday Night Fever, Grease, </i> Bee Gees,

27:06.917 --> 27:08.460
<i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

27:09.169 --> 27:14.091
He's putting together this...
movie-musical extravaganza.

27:14.174 --> 27:15.759
<i>Gone With the Solar Wind.</i>

27:16.093 --> 27:18.011
Big budget. Big stars.

27:18.095 --> 27:21.640
There's a part in it,
for a girl, acting part.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.934
Stigwood wants Misty to play the lead.

27:24.017 --> 27:26.019
- A young girl who sings.
- But that's me.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.105
She's gotta be sexy, though.

27:29.106 --> 27:29.940
I'm sexy.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.484
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.152
There's this thing...

27:35.445 --> 27:36.947
I got set up on Friday night.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.949
- This Friday?
- Yeah, why?

27:39.032 --> 27:42.077
Well, my church is having
their first potluck supper.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.538
There, there, there.
That's what I'm talking about.

27:44.621 --> 27:45.789
I'll skip it. Whatever.

27:45.873 --> 27:48.625
Just please,
tell me what's on for Friday.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.294
It's a new club, Ruby Con.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.338
It's like the new Studio 54,
but less riff-raff,

27:53.422 --> 27:55.924
better music, all the celebrities,

27:56.133 --> 27:57.676
plus the downtown artists,

27:57.759 --> 27:59.511
the literary crowd.

27:59.803 --> 28:00.804
All the tastemakers.

28:01.388 --> 28:05.100
Plus, they got go-go girls,
and they got live animal acts.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.603
And I got this song
we originally wrote for Misty

28:07.686 --> 28:11.315
for you to perform live at midnight
called "Toy Box."

28:11.899 --> 28:13.066
You bring the house down...

28:13.525 --> 28:16.069
Stigwood will probably cast you
in his movie.

28:16.153 --> 28:17.321
- Not Misty.
- I'll do it.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.490
It's a kind of sexy song.

28:20.991 --> 28:21.992
Even raunchy.

28:22.326 --> 28:25.287
And the costume.
I mean, you'll be covered, but barely.

28:25.871 --> 28:26.705
Yeah, okay.

28:28.081 --> 28:30.542
- I'll just let Regina and Yolanda know.
- No Regina.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.169
No Yolanda.

28:32.252 --> 28:35.255
True divas,
they don't share the stage with anybody.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.465
And no Jackie, either.

28:37.174 --> 28:38.050
And no parents.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.426
Okay, that's fine, but...

28:40.552 --> 28:44.014
I can't do it without Regina and Yolanda.
I can't do this without my girls.

28:44.097 --> 28:46.183
I need Stigwood and this downtown crowd

28:46.266 --> 28:48.227
to meet you, one-on-one.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.311
Then I can't do it.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.312
You were right.

28:51.897 --> 28:52.981
Sorry, Mr. Asheton.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.192
Okay, okay.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.653
Shane will rehearse the three of you,
but...

28:57.736 --> 29:00.197
- if you decide to back out on this thing...
- I won't.

29:00.739 --> 29:01.907
The proof's in the pudding.

29:02.491 --> 29:03.700
I am the pudding, Roy.

On wax! A real motherfucking record!

32:18.395 --> 32:19.479
But it's like you said.

32:19.563 --> 32:21.940
How are we gonna make a record
out of other records?

32:22.023 --> 32:23.817
Let the labels sort all of that shit out

32:23.900 --> 32:27.404

$1500 each upfront.

32:46.339 --> 32:50.177

32:50.260 --> 32:51.636
She had a vision, bro.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.848

33:12.157 --> 33:13.575
But let's just take a moment

33:13.658 --> 33:16.661
to assess minor facts
versus major opportunities, man.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.246
We agreed to put the music first.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.665
To live for the music, not for gangsters.

33:20.749 --> 33:23.627
This is living for the music, Books.
Come on.

33:23.710 --> 33:24.878
Well, I ain't signing it.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.214
Well, we finding somebody else.

33:27.297 --> 33:28.590

Without me, there is no group.

33:30.717 --> 33:34.179
- Fellas, look, we can solve this, man.
- Ain't no puzzle, Ra.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.723

Excuse me!

Gyration. Elation.

Pump it, bump it, hump it, strumpet.

35:21.745 --> 35:22.829
Hump it!

Don't forget.

35:26.207 --> 35:28.084
Lips and teeth. Lips and teeth.

Ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.

Is that you rapping?

35:53.860 --> 35:55.362
No, that's Grandmaster Caz.

35:55.445 --> 35:56.363
He's nice.

35:56.905 --> 35:59.574
Truth be told, he might be
the nicest MC out right now.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.161
But mixtapes is old news,

36:03.244 --> 36:05.455
'cause we about
to make a Get Down record.

36:05.538 --> 36:06.456
Y'all sing?

36:06.956 --> 36:10.460
Nah, we gonna put out a record of us MCing

36:11.044 --> 36:12.587
Oh! Like y'all do at the club.

36:12.671 --> 36:13.963
And pay us, too.

36:14.047 --> 36:16.216
Wow. My friend's a moneymaker.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.551
Yeah, but my dad's been cracking down,

36:18.635 --> 36:21.012
so when this record deal goes through,

36:21.096 --> 36:23.056
I'm gonna have
to stop scrambling and shit.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.057
Don't do that.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.101
You gotta make as much money as you can.

36:26.184 --> 36:30.105
Why? So I can buy you endless supplies
of pink champale and chips?

36:30.188 --> 36:33.692
Yeah, but what I really want...
is that dust.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.736
As a matter of fact,
let's get dusty right now

36:36.820 --> 36:38.154
and have some real fun.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.991
- Last one.
- We on our way to Popeye's to reup, right?

36:42.075 --> 36:43.493
- True.
- So, then kiss me.

36:43.785 --> 36:45.120
Yo, E, no peeking.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.498
Yo, I see you peeking.

37:01.428 --> 37:02.262
Okay, look.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.389
I know you mad at me
and I don't blame you.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.725
I'm mad at me, too,
because I made you mad at me.

37:06.808 --> 37:08.977
But even though...
You know, I'm mad at you, too.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.395
Mad at me?

37:11.438 --> 37:12.939
Who are you to be mad at me?

37:13.022 --> 37:15.108
Okay, but if we only got a minute here,

37:15.191 --> 37:17.026
could we just like... like...

37:18.361 --> 37:19.279
Like, I mean, it's...

37:21.239 --> 37:23.324
Because it's not what...

37:23.450 --> 37:25.910
I've known you my whole life.
I still can't get the words out.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.996
Words is what I do. That's who I am.
It's like...

37:29.164 --> 37:30.665
Or who I think I am.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.417
Zeke, what is it that you want?

37:32.500 --> 37:34.878
I just want my butterscotch queen...

37:36.004 --> 37:36.880
for like a second.

37:37.922 --> 37:42.010
My beautiful, glorious, gorgeous,

37:42.093 --> 37:43.803
sweet-tasting, breathtaking,

37:43.887 --> 37:45.764
startling, staggering, heart-daggering,

37:45.847 --> 37:48.266
luminous, caramel-coated,
golden, magnificent,

37:48.349 --> 37:51.394

37:53.188 --> 37:54.314
Can I?

37:54.898 --> 37:58.610
Can I have you on the fire escape
right now for, like, a second?

37:58.693 --> 37:59.778
All right.

38:01.070 --> 38:01.905
I get it.

38:03.531 --> 38:04.783
Because life ain't...

38:06.034 --> 38:08.411
- a black and white movie on channel 9...
- Ezekiel.

38:10.079 --> 38:10.914
Shut up.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.426
My father is gonna be home soon.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.513
- You're not very popular right now.
- I know.

38:26.596 --> 38:27.472
But you know what?

38:28.681 --> 38:31.142
I think you're fucking retarded...

38:31.226 --> 38:34.395
...for leaving your internship
and getting kicked out of your house

38:34.479 --> 38:38.691
and dedicating yourself
to this stupid fucking music that

38:38.775 --> 38:40.944
you can't even make a real record out of,
Zeke.

38:41.194 --> 38:42.362
And, oh, God.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.614
Shaolin,
don't even get me fucking started.

38:44.697 --> 38:45.615
Okay, I can explain.

38:45.698 --> 38:49.077
See, downtown, at my internship,
or at Yale...

38:49.911 --> 38:52.539
I'm the lucky orphan child

38:52.622 --> 38:56.626
whose fate depends
on being one of the good negroes,

38:56.709 --> 38:59.212
and never losing my cool
or saying what I actually think,

38:59.295 --> 39:00.964
or, God forbid, being me.

39:02.549 --> 39:03.383
On the mic...

39:04.801 --> 39:07.220
I'm the master of my destiny.

39:07.804 --> 39:08.638
And I love it.

39:08.721 --> 39:09.931
Like you love to sing.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.891
We can't fight that, can we?

39:13.768 --> 39:14.644
The thing is...

39:17.522 --> 39:19.941
I'm the one who's always
talking about breaking free.

39:20.567 --> 39:23.361
But you're the only one
who's actually doing it.

39:23.695 --> 39:26.197
- Yeah, well, you breaking free, too.
- Not really.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.074
I have a chance to.

39:29.534 --> 39:30.368
What you mean?

39:31.411 --> 39:32.495
Roy has a song for me.

39:32.579 --> 39:35.874
I'm supposed to perform it live
at, um, Ruby Con's.

39:35.957 --> 39:37.500
Yeah, that's the place to be.

39:37.584 --> 39:38.459
Yeah, and...

39:39.210 --> 39:40.795
you know, I could be in a movie.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.714
I could be in California.

39:42.797 --> 39:45.633
- Wait, for real?
- Yeah, but I can't tell no one.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.844
Not my parents or my <i>tio,</i> no one.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.555
This song, Zeke, it's...

39:51.055 --> 39:52.640
All right. Sing it for me.

39:53.641 --> 39:54.475
- No.
- Yeah.

39:54.559 --> 39:55.393
- No.
- Yeah.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.061
Zeke, no. Because it's dirty.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.772
In fact,
I have to be really sexy and great.

39:59.856 --> 40:03.484
And if I'm both, then,
I might actually get a part in this movie.

40:03.568 --> 40:06.988
I... I might be a little jealous, but...

40:07.071 --> 40:08.489
...that's your dream.

40:09.282 --> 40:10.116
Could you just...

40:11.075 --> 40:12.869
Could you please be there when I sing?

40:13.453 --> 40:17.624
And if I... get stuck or...

40:19.834 --> 40:22.462
I mess up, I can just find you?

40:23.004 --> 40:24.589
Hi, my angels!

40:24.672 --> 40:25.548
<i>Es mi padre.</i>

40:25.632 --> 40:26.466
I'll be there.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.259
When you break free.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.470
- Okay.

Check it out, y'all. Double dust.

41:15.556 --> 41:16.891
Double? Why?

41:17.266 --> 41:18.810
They had to mix it up real quick.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.937
Popeye said he heard
there was a crazy demand.

41:21.020 --> 41:21.854
That's right.

41:21.938 --> 41:23.815
If you'll excuse us,
we gotta talk business.

41:23.898 --> 41:25.984
- You think we can move all of this?
- Yo, scram, man.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.361
Boo.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.154
It's all good. I'm gonna be right out.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.449
No, we can't sell
all this dust in one night.

41:33.533 --> 41:34.367
It's dangerous.

41:34.450 --> 41:36.411
- Think about my fans.
- Fans?

41:36.661 --> 41:39.038
Think about our fans, man.

41:39.122 --> 41:42.083
Oh. So, you think people
