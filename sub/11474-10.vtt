00:00.036 --> 00:01.484
Previously on Hunters...

00:01.494 --> 00:04.119
You're not suicidal, Flynn.
You're angry.

00:04.129 --> 00:06.021
The Hunters did something to you.

00:06.031 --> 00:07.533
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

00:07.567 --> 00:09.513
Why did the Hunters target me? Why?

00:09.523 --> 00:11.644
Because you left when
you should have died.

00:11.654 --> 00:12.774
So who cares?

00:12.784 --> 00:15.521
Emme does. You're all she has now.

00:15.531 --> 00:18.715
And until you find out what really
happened, it will kill you.

00:18.725 --> 00:20.843
But your father, we have him.

00:20.877 --> 00:23.647
- Finnerman did this to you?
- A soldier brought me here.

00:23.679 --> 00:26.632
- Polynesian looking, had an accent.
- This guy?

00:26.642 --> 00:28.252
We've reunited you with your daughter.

00:28.262 --> 00:31.020
I only ask that you
translate Hunter recordings

00:31.054 --> 00:32.598
that we've intercepted.

00:32.607 --> 00:36.393
I think Hunters are reverting
to your alien shells

00:36.425 --> 00:39.106
because Musa is planning
a nuclear attack.

00:39.116 --> 00:41.405
And Musa has been
working with Viktor Karp,

00:41.415 --> 00:44.500
and arms dealer who has access
to long range missiles.

00:44.510 --> 00:46.369
Your mother tried to kill me.

00:47.803 --> 00:51.553
She's Musa's right hand. As long
as I'm alive, you're in danger.

00:52.915 --> 00:54.738
Protect the innocent ones.

00:54.748 --> 00:56.448
Please, someone help us!

01:04.186 --> 01:05.721
Alba, Biel, or Jones?

01:05.754 --> 01:07.723
Easy, Jessica Jones all the way.

01:07.756 --> 01:09.693
- Over this?
- You're insane, Brecke.

01:09.726 --> 01:11.894
- It's hypothetical, man.
- So hypothetically,

01:11.927 --> 01:14.773
he'd bang a comic book
chick instead of her.

01:14.783 --> 01:17.400
I did not have sexual relations

01:17.433 --> 01:19.967
- with that cartoon.
- Shouldn't you be scouting?

01:19.977 --> 01:21.705
Oh, I'm scouting all right.

01:21.738 --> 01:23.440
You're a piece of work, Carroll.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.075
Says the guy with papercuts on his dick.

01:25.986 --> 01:28.335
All right. All right, all right.

01:28.345 --> 01:30.907
Hold up. Keegan, turn that shit down.

01:37.311 --> 01:39.857
We got an encampment. 10:00.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.893
- What the hell is Tali doing out here?
- Waiting to throw us a party

01:42.926 --> 01:45.495
in a freaking circus tent?

01:46.563 --> 01:49.858
We got a convoy 15K behind us.
We should check it out, clear it.

01:49.868 --> 01:53.015
We're out of I.R. range.
We'll need to move in closer.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.609
Two ways through.

01:54.619 --> 01:56.383
The canyon's shorter.

01:56.393 --> 01:57.934
It's a blind approach.

01:59.075 --> 02:00.852
Blind for them, too.

02:00.862 --> 02:03.312
Your call, scout, what's it's gonna be?

02:05.019 --> 02:06.252
Canyon.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.429
Damn it! That's not good.

02:19.461 --> 02:21.191
Back it up! Back it up!

02:21.201 --> 02:23.833
Outlaw 1, Outlaw 1, we got a roadblock.

02:23.843 --> 02:26.110
- Bob, get us out of here.
- Roger that.

02:28.437 --> 02:30.661
- Yates is hit!
- Taking fire!

02:33.042 --> 02:35.254
- They're blocking our way out!
- Get out!

02:35.264 --> 02:37.050
Go, go, go!

02:39.277 --> 02:41.585
Come on!

02:41.617 --> 02:43.986
Let's move, move, move, now!

02:47.808 --> 02:49.727
Come on, move, move!

02:53.263 --> 02:55.665
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

02:57.753 --> 03:00.103
He's hit! Fall back!

03:06.719 --> 03:08.511
Brecke, no!

03:09.934 --> 03:12.549
- My leg's hit!
- Brecke, up!

03:12.581 --> 03:14.817
Come on, soldier!

03:22.391 --> 03:23.692
Outlaw one!

03:23.726 --> 03:26.154
I'm with Brecke, Keegan, and Yates!

03:26.321 --> 03:30.400
We're surrounded!
Say again, we're surrounded!

03:31.596 --> 03:34.704
We keep shooting,
but they're not going down!

04:15.677 --> 04:18.714
Some Hunter victims like Jules Calloway

04:18.747 --> 04:21.784
have the same scar on the
forearm that you have.

04:21.817 --> 04:24.225
Except I'm still here and they're not.

04:24.235 --> 04:27.107
Yeah, there's got to be
some reason you survived.

04:27.117 --> 04:28.836
Brecke may know why.

04:28.846 --> 04:31.394
I've got a D.O.D. bird
that'll fly you to Alabama.

04:31.427 --> 04:34.351
From there, you take a car
to Brecke's home.

04:34.361 --> 04:37.143
See if his recollection
of the attack on your unit

04:37.153 --> 04:38.868
is any better than yours.

04:40.170 --> 04:45.474
Will do. And sir, tell Agent
Regan I'm sorry for her loss.

04:45.743 --> 04:46.887
Yeah.

04:58.109 --> 04:59.624
Ow, my leg!

05:00.189 --> 05:02.814
You're good. You're gonna be okay.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.372
I'm out!

05:05.961 --> 05:08.264
They've got snipers
on both ends of the canyon.

05:08.298 --> 05:10.033
- There's no way out.
- Screw that.

05:10.065 --> 05:12.536
I got us in here, I'm gonna get us out!

05:16.339 --> 05:17.807
Shit! I'm out, too.

05:35.642 --> 05:37.727
There was this one time,

05:37.759 --> 05:41.400
I was ten, I was molting.

05:42.536 --> 05:44.357
It used to freak me out.

05:44.595 --> 05:48.572
Layers of myself just falling off.

05:49.437 --> 05:52.586
And my dad did this really corny thing.

05:53.810 --> 05:56.346
He showed me a caterpillar
in our backyard

05:56.356 --> 05:58.882
molting out of its cocoon.

05:59.375 --> 06:02.835
And he said, "Don't hate what you are."

06:04.499 --> 06:05.934
"Be patient.

06:07.598 --> 06:09.560
Someday, we'll all have wings."

06:12.161 --> 06:13.930
Finnerman said no, didn't she?

06:13.963 --> 06:18.217
Your request was denied.
He'll be autopsied like the others.

06:18.227 --> 06:20.292
- Regan... Allison...
- I will fucking kill her.

06:20.302 --> 06:24.079
My father killed himself because
of that bitch. You realize that?

06:28.478 --> 06:30.925
You need to take some time off.

06:30.935 --> 06:32.149
Grieve.

06:34.221 --> 06:36.386
Dr. James can arrange counseling.

06:36.418 --> 06:39.416
- Because that's what humans do?
- Because that's what you need.

06:39.426 --> 06:42.825
- When my father died...
- You prayed and you got fixed.

06:44.374 --> 06:47.051
- Well, I don't work like that.
- Allison, all I'm suggesting is you...

06:47.061 --> 06:49.232
I said I'm fine.

06:54.566 --> 06:55.808
All right.

07:06.382 --> 07:08.584
- Hey, Emme.
- I need to see you.

07:08.617 --> 07:11.890
I miss you too, but I can't
today, I'm out of town.

07:11.900 --> 07:14.024
- It's important.
- We can talk now.

07:14.057 --> 07:15.824
What's wrong? You okay?

07:15.858 --> 07:18.995
I can't talk about this on the phone.

07:19.028 --> 07:20.697
Can you please get down here?

07:20.730 --> 07:22.365
It's important I see you now.

07:22.398 --> 07:25.001
Emme, I'm really sorry.
I gotta take care of something.

07:25.033 --> 07:27.428
Just a quick work trip.
I'll see you as soon as I get back.

07:27.438 --> 07:29.605
- Flynn, you don't understand.
- I do.

07:29.639 --> 07:31.313
I hear you.

07:31.323 --> 07:34.781
Look, if it's urgent,
maybe the staff can help, yeah?

07:34.791 --> 07:36.805
No, they can't.

07:38.170 --> 07:39.508
Emme?

08:29.531 --> 08:31.280
Hello, Carroll.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.238
I had a feeling you'd
show up here one day.

08:39.557 --> 08:41.907
They got me stationed at Red Stone now.

08:41.917 --> 08:44.039
Space and Missile Defense Command.

08:44.039 --> 08:47.041
Got you pushing papers
at the S.M.D.C., huh?

08:47.042 --> 08:49.311
Can't push much else these days.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.892
Hey, Katie!

08:52.902 --> 08:55.550
I got someone I'd like you to meet.

08:55.551 --> 08:57.017
This here is Flynn Carroll.

08:57.018 --> 08:58.976
We served together in '06, '07.

08:58.986 --> 09:01.122
Well, the pleasure
is most certainly mine.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.607
- Welcome.
- Nice to meet you.

09:02.617 --> 09:06.994
I hear my husband was a bit of
a handful in his unruly youth.

09:06.995 --> 09:09.311
This guy? Always a gentleman.

09:09.321 --> 09:11.239
That's what I keep telling her.

09:11.249 --> 09:12.886
You look thirsty.

09:12.896 --> 09:14.536
Let's get you a drink.

09:15.898 --> 09:19.241
I've suggested the cause
of death was exsanguination.

09:19.242 --> 09:21.105
He ruptured an artery.

09:21.115 --> 09:23.523
Generally, this wouldn't be
fatal to a human form Hunter,

09:23.533 --> 09:27.565
but he was in a very weak
physical state from the torture.

09:27.575 --> 09:31.185
The interruption of blood supply also
collapsed his echolocation chambers.

09:31.186 --> 09:34.088
Under the ears, where the
clicks are generated.

09:34.176 --> 09:36.095
Briefing in ten.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.225
Regan?

09:38.340 --> 09:39.962
I heard you.

09:41.744 --> 09:43.215
Don't be late.

09:45.133 --> 09:47.061
You don't need to see this, Allison.

09:47.071 --> 09:48.426
Yes, I do.

09:49.227 --> 09:50.539
Okay.

09:59.260 --> 10:02.483
Beautiful wife, kids, this house.

10:02.693 --> 10:05.420
I gotta hand it to you, man.
You really put it together.

10:05.421 --> 10:07.855
Nine years is a long time, Flynn.

10:09.325 --> 10:10.867
Something tells me you're not just here

10:10.877 --> 10:13.496
for some scotch
and a quick "how ya doin'?"

10:16.854 --> 10:18.834
I need to know what you remember

10:18.844 --> 10:20.437
from over there.

10:20.447 --> 10:23.371
It was a two-year tour, a lot happened.

10:24.174 --> 10:26.641
I'm talking about the parts
you might want to forget.

10:26.642 --> 10:27.834
I figured.

10:27.844 --> 10:29.833
- Why now?
- Like you said.

10:30.098 --> 10:31.295
Nine years.

10:32.554 --> 10:34.164
- I figured it's time.
- Bullshit.

10:34.174 --> 10:36.561
All these years, you never once called.

10:37.362 --> 10:39.826
- Never even came to see me.
- You know why.

10:39.836 --> 10:43.983
My call to take our unit through
that canyon. It was my fault.

10:43.993 --> 10:46.763
Whatever happened back
then, it's history.

10:49.465 --> 10:50.953
I've moved on.

10:51.887 --> 10:53.233
So should you.

10:53.243 --> 10:55.644
I've tried, man, but I can't.

10:56.137 --> 10:59.107
Something happened to me. To us.

10:59.328 --> 11:01.000
I need to get past it.

11:01.010 --> 11:04.045
We have the translations Regan's
father did for Finnerman.

11:04.046 --> 11:05.914
I'm attempting to
use them for decryption,

11:05.915 --> 11:09.416
but there is a question about whether
he was, in fact, cooperating.

11:09.417 --> 11:10.922
Stay on it.

11:10.932 --> 11:12.388
Keep me posted.

11:14.054 --> 11:16.391
Briggs, any word on Karp?

11:16.392 --> 11:19.261
I got a guy in CISEN,
Mexican intelligence.

11:19.262 --> 11:22.196
Says Karp was in the country working
on a large-scale weapons deal.

11:22.197 --> 11:25.065
We know the Hunters have the cash
flow from their drugs trade.

11:25.075 --> 11:27.330
Well, Karp's in the wind now,
so that lead's gone.

11:27.340 --> 11:29.373
How do you screw that up?

11:29.383 --> 11:31.351
I gave you the exact location
of his compound.

11:31.352 --> 11:33.687
And he cleared it out after
you failed to capture anyone.

11:33.688 --> 11:35.322
Enough.

11:35.323 --> 11:36.890
I'll contact NSA, TSA.

11:36.891 --> 11:38.491
If Karp pops his head up, we'll know.

11:38.492 --> 11:41.391
- You don't need to do that.
- Say again?

11:42.113 --> 11:45.899
Finnerman's taking point
on interagency cooperation.

11:46.660 --> 11:47.989
I guess you're out of the loop.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.891
Guess we know whose
teat you're suckling.

11:49.901 --> 11:51.549
You don't know jack shit.

11:51.559 --> 11:55.042
- That will be all for now.
- Oh, but Regan's got more to say.

11:55.043 --> 11:57.044
Come on. Spit it out, Guano.

11:57.045 --> 11:59.573
You captured my father for Finnerman.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.004
- Is this true?
- No.

12:01.014 --> 12:02.534
How long have you been her lapdog?

12:02.544 --> 12:04.578
How long have you been his bitch.

12:05.620 --> 12:06.986
- Back off!
- Come on.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.255
Let's settle this. Girl-to-girl.

12:09.256 --> 12:12.160
- What the hell did you just say?
- Briggs! Regan!

12:13.228 --> 12:16.099
Lockers. Stay out of the lab.

12:16.798 --> 12:18.842
My office, right now.

12:26.633 --> 12:29.067
_

12:29.077 --> 12:30.409
There you go! Yeah!

12:40.822 --> 12:42.856
- They got Yates.
- Yates!

12:42.857 --> 12:44.851
We're coming, buddy!

12:49.717 --> 12:51.765
Flynn.

12:51.766 --> 12:53.238
Flynn, come here.

12:53.248 --> 12:55.757
Yeah, yeah?

12:56.532 --> 12:58.160
I can't feel it.

13:02.343 --> 13:04.044
It's nothing, all right?

13:04.045 --> 13:05.797
All right, you're in shock.

13:05.807 --> 13:08.227
Damn it, stop lying to me.

13:09.433 --> 13:11.050
I'm gonna die here.

13:11.309 --> 13:12.986
We're walking out of here.

13:12.987 --> 13:15.988
- You hear me, huh?
- Yeah.

13:15.989 --> 13:17.796
We're walking out of here.

13:34.707 --> 13:37.301
After the firefight, we were taken.

13:37.311 --> 13:40.415
I was the third guy the Haji's
pulled out. That's all I remember.

13:40.425 --> 13:42.159
And did you see it?

13:43.351 --> 13:45.836
- The thing that took you out of the pit?
- It?

13:46.452 --> 13:47.653
A man pulled me out.

13:47.663 --> 13:50.406
Had a drape pulled over his head
so I couldn't see his face.

13:50.416 --> 13:52.773
You were the second to last one taken,

13:52.783 --> 13:55.395
- and not by a Haji.
- Who took me, then?

13:56.281 --> 13:58.313
- I need you to believe me.
- Believe what?

13:58.323 --> 14:01.803
The thing that pulled us out...

14:03.463 --> 14:05.136
was a monster.

14:10.021 --> 14:11.342
You're not serious.

14:11.352 --> 14:13.746
I didn't get a good look
at it when we were there,

14:13.747 --> 14:17.516
but the last couple weeks,
I started seeing it, in nightmares,

14:17.517 --> 14:19.553
flashes in my mind.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.221
I call it the Mandrake,

14:21.222 --> 14:23.155
after a book I read when I was a kid.

14:23.156 --> 14:24.318
Flynn?

14:25.801 --> 14:27.323
You were hallucinating.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.291
We were days without food,

14:29.301 --> 14:32.799
- hearing our buddies getting tortured.
- I wasn't hallucinating.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.534
- It was real.
- Boogeyman out of a kid's book?

14:35.535 --> 14:38.860
- Flynn, listen to yourself.
- I know what I saw.

14:39.573 --> 14:41.413
And I know you saw it, too.

14:41.977 --> 14:43.610
Look, I get it.

14:43.936 --> 14:46.612
You don't want to deal with it.

14:46.613 --> 14:49.982
But Brecke, brother, I'm begging you.

14:49.983 --> 14:54.254
You have to tell me
exactly what you saw out there.

14:54.452 --> 14:56.882
Just tell me what you remember.

14:58.059 --> 15:01.160
- You sure you want to know?
- Yes.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.512
I'm sure.

15:11.630 --> 15:14.975
You were the only one
they pulled out of that pit.

15:15.309 --> 15:18.324
When they put you back in
with the rest of us,

15:18.334 --> 15:19.960
you were different.

15:20.400 --> 15:23.985
Our captors didn't kill
a single one of us.

15:26.613 --> 15:27.793
You did.

15:32.735 --> 15:34.627
It can't be true.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.354
I'm not a murderer.

15:38.212 --> 15:41.020
What you did was unthinkable.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.904
But so was what we went through.

15:43.905 --> 15:46.073
No man should have survived that.

15:46.392 --> 15:49.543
I don't blame you for what
you did, coming apart like that.

15:50.057 --> 15:52.126
I'm just thankful it wasn't me.

15:52.681 --> 15:54.891
I wouldn't lie to you, Flynn, I'm sorry.

16:01.465 --> 16:03.050
I need a minute.

16:05.797 --> 16:07.084
Sure.

16:35.155 --> 16:36.756
You're not real!

16:36.757 --> 16:38.863
You're in a book!

16:38.873 --> 16:41.560
You're not real! You're in a book!

16:51.104 --> 16:55.342
Two weeks after
Regan's father was detained,

16:55.343 --> 16:56.842
you were transferred

16:56.843 --> 17:00.079
into Finnerman's division of the D.O.D.

17:00.080 --> 17:03.889
That transfer feels more like
quid pro quo than a coincidence.

17:03.899 --> 17:06.652
I don't speak Latin, so.

17:06.653 --> 17:09.204
I just follow orders.

17:10.798 --> 17:14.527
You took Regan's father into
custody at Finnerman's behest.

17:14.528 --> 17:16.663
Are you still getting orders from her?

17:18.361 --> 17:19.999
Agent Briggs, yes or no?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.890
Are you still getting direct orders

17:21.900 --> 17:24.170
from Assistant Secretary Finnerman?

17:24.390 --> 17:27.107
Loyalty is what makes me valuable.

17:27.550 --> 17:31.076
If the assistant secretary
asks for my discretion,

17:31.077 --> 17:32.411
I'll have to comply.

17:32.412 --> 17:35.747
Don't ask, don't tell,
that's your policy?

17:35.757 --> 17:37.449
I have nothing to hide,

17:37.450 --> 17:39.252
and so help me if that Guano

17:39.253 --> 17:42.221
takes another crack at my personal life.

17:42.525 --> 17:44.291
I will skin her scaly ass.

17:44.292 --> 17:46.778
Secrets will destroy this unit.

17:46.788 --> 17:49.830
So will a lack of leadership, sir.

17:49.831 --> 17:52.599
You watch your attitude, son.

17:52.881 --> 17:54.669
Do not test me.

17:59.038 --> 18:02.820
Work your weapons contacts,
try to find the line on Karp.

18:02.830 --> 18:06.773
The new cryptographer is working
on decoding the Hunter language.

18:06.783 --> 18:09.349
Regan will work separately with
her until you two cool down.

18:09.350 --> 18:12.084
Oh, I can cool down, sir.

18:12.085 --> 18:15.110
- Guanos can't.
- Get out of my office.

18:32.939 --> 18:34.641
Come with me, Agent.

18:35.875 --> 18:37.125
Now.

18:46.818 --> 18:49.274
You're going to torture me
for going after Briggs.

18:49.284 --> 18:50.724
Bring it on.

18:50.725 --> 18:53.056
I can't hurt any more than I already do.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.072
I know you can't.

18:55.082 --> 18:58.931
I also know the treatment
makes you feel better.

18:58.932 --> 19:00.633
Just a low dose.

19:00.634 --> 19:02.968
Take the edge off the pain
you're experiencing.

19:02.969 --> 19:05.272
That's all I'm suggesting.

19:05.553 --> 19:07.938
What? You're offering me a treatment?

19:07.948 --> 19:09.893
But you've said this is like drugs,

19:09.903 --> 19:12.077
that I should deal with
my shit the human way.

19:12.087 --> 19:13.717
When you don't believe in my God,

19:13.727 --> 19:16.138
you won't accept my comfort.

19:16.587 --> 19:18.867
This is all I can offer you, Allison.

19:20.224 --> 19:22.158
And what if it affects me in the field?

19:22.159 --> 19:23.561
You're affected now.

19:27.733 --> 19:30.900
- I don't want to be weak.
- That's the last thing you are.

19:31.266 --> 19:34.106
I'll run it. Nobody else need know.

20:25.435 --> 20:28.711
- You need to leave, now.
- Excuse me?

20:28.721 --> 20:31.928
After all these years, you came
back to dredge up the past?

20:31.929 --> 20:34.084
Bad things happen, I get it.

20:34.094 --> 20:36.998
Bob made a terrible mistake,
but he forgave himself.

20:37.008 --> 20:39.703
- What mistake?
- The ambush.

20:39.704 --> 20:42.237
Bob ordered you
to go through that canyon.

20:44.242 --> 20:46.710
Bob told you it was his call
to take us through the canyon?

20:46.711 --> 20:48.945
It wasn't his fault.

20:48.946 --> 20:51.001
I just don't want
to see him clam up again.

20:51.011 --> 20:54.717
He's really opened up
ever since the accident.

20:54.718 --> 20:56.184
What accident?

20:56.352 --> 20:58.016
What, he didn't tell you?

21:01.065 --> 21:02.244
Three years ago,

21:02.254 --> 21:05.462
Bob drove off the road one night
coming home late from work.

21:05.463 --> 21:07.531
He went missing for two weeks.

21:07.532 --> 21:10.099
He never said a word to me
about Paktia before that,

21:10.100 --> 21:12.641
but after we found him, he opened up.

21:12.651 --> 21:15.442
It's like he's a whole new man now.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.013
You okay?

21:22.089 --> 21:23.489
I need to use your bathroom.

21:23.982 --> 21:25.056
Okay.

21:43.866 --> 21:46.801
Flynn? Everything okay in there?

21:46.811 --> 21:50.408
Um, be right out.

21:58.376 --> 21:59.750
You all right?

22:00.022 --> 22:01.929
Yeah, Katie asked me to leave, so...

22:01.939 --> 22:04.994
I know, she overreacted.
You should stay for dinner.

22:07.485 --> 22:09.792
Yeah, I can't.

22:10.153 --> 22:14.098
After what you just told me,
I really should get going.

22:14.099 --> 22:15.633
No, that's exactly why you should stay.

22:15.634 --> 22:18.231
Calm down. Pull yourself together.

22:19.525 --> 22:20.864
I insist.

22:21.991 --> 22:25.608
I'll just call my kid
and tell her I'll be late.

22:25.609 --> 22:27.211
Family first.

22:28.156 --> 22:29.680
Get you a beer.

22:40.487 --> 22:41.850
Hi, Emme, it's me.

22:42.098 --> 22:43.823
I'm just checking in,

22:45.857 --> 22:47.618
I'm gonna be home late.

22:49.097 --> 22:50.298
It's Carroll.

22:50.308 --> 22:53.645
- Get a line on his cell.
- I'm visiting an old friend.

22:56.707 --> 22:58.342
I'll see you soon, kiddo.

23:00.950 --> 23:02.753
Carroll's in trouble.

23:02.763 --> 23:06.617
I want everything we've got on
a Lieutenant Colonel Bob Brecke.

23:06.618 --> 23:08.320
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

23:14.464 --> 23:17.630
Lieutennant Colonel Breake
is stationed at Redstone.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.626
Flynn's cell pings at his home address.

23:19.636 --> 23:21.904
- Hunters want him, too?
- We don't know.

23:22.390 --> 23:24.426
Take a team to his address.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.394
There's a D.O.D. chopper standing by.

23:26.395 --> 23:28.118
I'll keep a trace on Carroll's phone.

23:28.138 --> 23:29.932
Whatever you say, sir.

23:32.842 --> 23:34.896
Flynn, would you like to lead grace?

23:34.906 --> 23:38.971
It's been a while. Just keep
it honest, you'll do fine.

23:44.183 --> 23:45.652
Dear Father,

23:45.662 --> 23:49.518
thank you for this food
and the hands that prepared it.

23:52.494 --> 23:57.141
Bless us and keep us all safe from harm.

23:58.127 --> 23:59.259
Amen.

23:59.492 --> 24:00.493
- Amen.
- Amen.

24:00.503 --> 24:01.638
Amen.

24:09.714 --> 24:12.593
Flynn, it's five hours and
seven minutes since we spoke.

24:12.603 --> 24:14.082
Why haven't you called me back?

24:14.092 --> 24:17.052
I have papers and photos
from those boxes in our house.

24:17.053 --> 24:19.354
I know Abby isn't
who we thought she was.

24:19.355 --> 24:21.657
She knows about Abby? How?

24:21.859 --> 24:23.558
Play it again.

24:24.060 --> 24:27.028
Flynn, it's five hours and
seven minutes since we spoke.

24:27.029 --> 24:28.464
Why haven't you called me back?

24:28.465 --> 24:31.399
I have papers and photos
from those boxes in our house.

24:31.400 --> 24:34.670
I know Abby isn't
who we thought she was.

24:39.327 --> 24:41.176
Everything all right with Emme?

24:42.851 --> 24:44.935
I didn't realize I mentioned her name.

24:44.945 --> 24:47.315
I've been stalking you.

24:47.697 --> 24:49.166
You know, on Facebook.

24:49.176 --> 24:51.253
She's a teenager, yeah?

24:52.699 --> 24:54.924
You must worry about her all the time.

24:55.488 --> 24:56.738
Yeah.

24:59.972 --> 25:01.690
Scary world out there.

25:02.033 --> 25:03.944
Accidents happen.

25:04.525 --> 25:06.910
I heard Katie telling you about mine.

25:08.004 --> 25:09.807
I have awful good hearing.

25:10.098 --> 25:12.378
But you knew that already, didn't you?

25:17.380 --> 25:20.215
I have papers and photos
from those boxes in our house.

25:20.216 --> 25:22.643
What boxes is she talking about?

25:22.653 --> 25:25.468
- We need to find out.
- Agent Regan will handle it.

25:25.478 --> 25:27.776
Perhaps Allison's not in a fit state

25:27.786 --> 25:29.925
with her father's death so recent.

25:29.926 --> 25:32.326
How would you assess
your state, Agent Regan?

25:32.327 --> 25:34.295
Are you fit for duty?

25:34.296 --> 25:35.663
Yes, ma'am.

25:36.078 --> 25:37.816
If the girl can't reach Carroll,

25:37.826 --> 25:39.935
she may talk to someone else
about what she's found,

25:39.936 --> 25:42.198
so you're to find out what she knows

25:42.208 --> 25:45.098
- and respond accordingly.
- You want me to contain her?

25:45.108 --> 25:47.136
Well, I won't have this unit compromised

25:47.146 --> 25:49.441
by a child showing off
on the playground.

25:49.451 --> 25:50.973
Then find someone else.

25:50.983 --> 25:54.280
Get your boy toy Briggs
to do your dirty work.

25:54.808 --> 25:57.132
I believe that you have
requested your father's remains

25:57.142 --> 25:58.821
be returned to you.

25:59.046 --> 26:00.688
Yeah, to bury him.

26:01.361 --> 26:02.957
Not cut him up like some animal.

26:02.958 --> 26:05.093
His years in the black site make him

26:05.094 --> 26:06.961
an invaluable specimen to us.

26:06.962 --> 26:08.118
Are you even hearing this?

26:08.128 --> 26:10.998
My orders override Commander Jackson's.

26:10.999 --> 26:12.633
You do your job, Agent,

26:12.634 --> 26:14.734
and then we'll talk about your father.

26:28.016 --> 26:30.151
I was thinking later,

26:30.152 --> 26:32.086
you and I take a drive out to the base.

26:32.087 --> 26:34.288
- I can show you around.
- I'd love to.

26:34.289 --> 26:36.129
But I got my daughter waiting for me.

26:36.139 --> 26:38.293
She'll understand.

26:38.589 --> 26:41.321
I'll call that kiddo myself if you like.

26:41.331 --> 26:42.563
Here.

26:42.564 --> 26:44.265
- Let me help you with that.
- No, she's got it.

26:44.266 --> 26:45.825
Don't you, sweetie?

26:45.835 --> 26:47.567
You stay right there.

26:47.577 --> 26:49.403
Bob, he's just trying to help.

26:49.404 --> 26:50.761
Thank you.

26:56.579 --> 26:58.679
Boys, stay inside!

27:27.643 --> 27:29.971
- Hi, Emme.
- Who are you?

27:29.981 --> 27:32.413
- I work with Flynn.
- Where is he?

27:32.414 --> 27:34.480
I called him six-and-a-half hours ago.

27:34.490 --> 27:36.717
Why hasn't he called me back?

27:37.099 --> 27:39.254
- Is he all right?
- He's fine.

27:39.614 --> 27:41.949
We had a big break in the case.

27:42.222 --> 27:44.097
You mean Abby's murder.

27:45.366 --> 27:47.528
He told me you left him a message.

27:47.529 --> 27:50.220
That you had information about Abby.

27:50.704 --> 27:52.434
I'd better wait for Flynn.

27:52.435 --> 27:53.669
No, it's cool.

27:53.670 --> 27:56.772
You can show me whatever
you have, he won't mind.

27:58.387 --> 27:59.628
Okay.

28:00.640 --> 28:01.944
But it isn't here.

28:01.945 --> 28:03.233
Then where is it?

28:05.415 --> 28:06.718
I'll show you.

28:14.991 --> 28:16.837
_

28:16.847 --> 28:18.362
Holy shit.

28:21.358 --> 28:23.399
No. No.

28:27.299 --> 28:28.994
What the fuck?

30:07.604 --> 30:09.884
- What's Flynn's favorite food?
- What?

30:11.152 --> 30:12.694
How would I know?

30:13.074 --> 30:14.579
I thought you said you were his friend.

30:14.589 --> 30:15.979
Work friends.

30:16.304 --> 30:18.306
We don't talk about stuff like that.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.651
Then what do you talk about?

30:20.652 --> 30:22.585
Our work is confidential.

30:22.586 --> 30:24.714
We work for Homeland Security.

30:25.753 --> 30:28.159
That's cool. I didn't know that.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.827
Flynn never talks about
his work with you?

30:30.828 --> 30:31.996
No...

30:32.312 --> 30:34.679
We don't talk about anything, really.

30:34.689 --> 30:37.243
- Mostly we just fight.
- Where are we going?

30:37.253 --> 30:40.336
My class went on a hike
a couple of days ago.

30:40.337 --> 30:42.273
They say it's therapeutic.

30:42.274 --> 30:43.841
They found a trailer.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.315
Is that where the files are?

30:45.325 --> 30:47.478
I never said I had files.

30:47.479 --> 30:48.818
Flynn told me.

30:51.716 --> 30:54.565
- What's wrong?
- I need to pee.

30:54.575 --> 30:56.840
- We can go back.
- No, it's okay.

30:57.272 --> 30:58.821
I'll go here.

31:05.272 --> 31:06.663
Hey!

31:21.645 --> 31:23.079
Who are you?

31:23.080 --> 31:25.783
Where is Flynn? Did you hurt him?

31:25.784 --> 31:28.919
- Are you one of those things?
- I didn't hurt Flynn.

31:29.350 --> 31:31.031
Are you gonna hurt me?

31:31.920 --> 31:33.990
You know something about Abby.

31:34.203 --> 31:37.894
Something important
and you're going to show me.

31:38.305 --> 31:39.430
Or what?

31:46.805 --> 31:48.505
I'm sorry.

31:48.892 --> 31:52.159
I... I didn't mean to hurt you.

31:54.507 --> 31:56.047
Not a good move, kid.

32:00.155 --> 32:01.775
I'm not gonna ask again.

32:52.370 --> 32:53.970
It's okay.

32:53.971 --> 32:55.465
I'm not gonna hurt you.

33:01.008 --> 33:02.912
I'm here to help.

33:03.095 --> 33:05.215
Can you tell me who did this?

33:05.216 --> 33:06.696
Was it a monster?

33:09.355 --> 33:11.389
Was it someone you recognize?

33:14.294 --> 33:15.835
Was it your dad?

33:19.169 --> 33:21.700
Okay, come on.

33:28.651 --> 33:30.062
Agent Briggs.

33:45.522 --> 33:47.755
Get those kids out of here.

33:56.534 --> 33:57.969
Jackson.

33:57.970 --> 34:00.069
Confirming Brecke's a Hunter,

34:00.646 --> 34:03.131
running a hidden comms center.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.845
No sign of Flynn.

34:52.357 --> 34:55.353
This file has pictures of bodies.

34:56.293 --> 34:58.062
They're not human.

35:05.970 --> 35:08.172
These are fake, right?

35:08.205 --> 35:09.908
Like alien autopsies are real.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.547
That's what I thought, too.

35:12.890 --> 35:16.049
But then I found these.

35:19.702 --> 35:22.220
Abby's skin did the same thing.

35:22.252 --> 35:23.520
You saw it?

35:23.736 --> 35:24.844
Just once.

35:24.854 --> 35:28.026
Um, I walked in on it once by mistake.

35:28.058 --> 35:30.227
She was rubbing lotion on it.

35:30.474 --> 35:34.418
It's exactly the same
as in these pictures.

35:35.686 --> 35:39.236
And these pictures are
of non-human subjects.

35:39.270 --> 35:41.190
That's what it says in the notes.

35:46.042 --> 35:50.749
Whatever these things are,
that's what Abby was.

35:53.029 --> 35:55.854
And it's what you are, too, isn't it?

35:57.740 --> 36:01.593
There's even more stuff in the...
in the boxes at Flynn's house.

36:01.625 --> 36:04.836
Pictures and files. I read them all.

36:17.808 --> 36:21.784
ETU is on the way.
They'll find Katie's body.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.249
Not really your concern anymore, is it?

36:32.899 --> 36:35.241
I don't know what he sees in you.

36:38.831 --> 36:40.812
- Who?
- Musa.

36:40.917 --> 36:43.835
If it were up to me,
I would have eaten you alive.

36:46.987 --> 36:48.667
You were there.

36:49.001 --> 36:51.610
You were one of the Hunters at Paktia.

37:16.968 --> 37:19.337
Brecke, what's happening?

37:21.071 --> 37:22.936
What the fuck is that?

37:27.497 --> 37:29.614
The Great Hunt.

37:29.647 --> 37:32.450
You boys were the prey.

37:36.354 --> 37:37.522
It's you.

37:38.643 --> 37:40.201
You're the Mandrake!

37:44.204 --> 37:46.537
We'll finish what I started.

38:00.544 --> 38:02.212
Go, Flynn, run.

38:02.546 --> 38:04.026
I'm not leaving you.

38:05.663 --> 38:06.790
Run.

38:07.517 --> 38:08.682
Run.

38:09.650 --> 38:12.195
Run! Run!

39:27.131 --> 39:30.501
Hang on, Bob.
I'm getting you out of here.

39:32.535 --> 39:35.072
I got you, I got you.

39:37.231 --> 39:40.451
You saved Bob, and it saved you.

39:42.680 --> 39:45.971
- Why?
- Musa thought it was a sign.

39:46.649 --> 39:48.367
That's bullshit.

39:48.377 --> 39:50.587
Musa's been wrong before.

39:51.264 --> 39:53.256
I got Bob eventually.

40:03.734 --> 40:06.136
His accident. Your leg.

40:06.169 --> 40:10.602
Cut mine off to match him,
the lame son of a bitch.

40:20.750 --> 40:23.040
You murdered my friend!

40:43.735 --> 40:45.843
Why did you look in those boxes?

40:46.367 --> 40:49.807
Why couldn't you just
leave this all alone? Stupid,

40:50.565 --> 40:51.848
stupid kid.

40:51.881 --> 40:54.084
All this weird stuff was happening.

40:54.118 --> 40:57.121
Abby's missing, Abby's dead,
Abby's a something.

40:57.154 --> 41:00.078
- I needed to know the truth.
- Doesn't help.

41:00.386 --> 41:01.658
Can I please just call my dad?

41:01.692 --> 41:04.392
- Flynn is not your dad.
- He's all I've got!

41:05.184 --> 41:06.408
Too low.

41:09.834 --> 41:11.671
The dose was too low.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.683
What are you talking about?

41:14.832 --> 41:16.945
Protect the innocents.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.563
She's going to cut him up.

41:19.573 --> 41:21.774
Who? Who's getting cut up?

41:21.784 --> 41:23.693
You're not making sense.

41:35.882 --> 41:38.562
Someday, we'll all have wings.

41:57.982 --> 42:00.334
Why did Musa let me live?

42:01.189 --> 42:02.906
A sign of what?

42:03.865 --> 42:05.001
Tell me!

42:10.688 --> 42:12.079
This...

42:12.599 --> 42:15.627
this is for P.F.C. Brecke,

42:17.100 --> 42:19.002
you son of a bitch.
