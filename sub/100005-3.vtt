you know,

13:07.011 --> 13:09.845
you might want to support him,
get your guys to help him out.

13:09.845 --> 13:11.804
Maybe not bust his balls
so much.

13:11.804 --> 13:13.553
Before you put this idea
in Ward's head,

13:13.553 --> 13:15.261
which I'm sure as shit
you did,

13:15.261 --> 13:17.303
did he grasp the fact
that a law-and-order black guy

13:17.303 --> 13:20.095
is the last thing anyone
in Boston wants?

13:20.095 --> 13:21.720
You been around a long time,
Rohr.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.720
All those cops looking
to reach their pensions,

13:24.720 --> 13:26.553
lawyers in the DA's office
who's only there

13:26.553 --> 13:27.720
because they know
someone.

13:27.720 --> 13:31.261
A crusader threatens
their way of life.

13:31.261 --> 13:33.095
Your way of life.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.178
Yet I'm here, ain't I?

13:39.261 --> 13:40.929
[phones ringing]

13:41.887 --> 13:44.178
So it fits.

13:44.178 --> 13:45.970
-Excuse me?
-Your head.

13:45.970 --> 13:48.428
You managed to stick your head
up your own fucking ass.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.428
Kelly Kinicki.

13:50.428 --> 13:52.512
You wanna put a four-year-old
missing persons case

13:52.512 --> 13:54.178
in front of a grand jury?

13:54.178 --> 13:55.470
What the fuck you thinking,
Ward?

13:55.470 --> 13:58.053
Code of silence.

13:58.053 --> 14:00.512
They freeze us out.
Won't talk to the cops.

14:00.512 --> 14:02.178
Look, we need to show 'em

14:02.178 --> 14:05.053
that we're not gonna
give up so easy anymore.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.887
You shoulda taken some time
off after that church incident.

14:07.887 --> 14:09.720
Seeing a kid murdered.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.387
I know exactly
what I'm doing.

14:11.387 --> 14:14.762
Hey, I am more than willing
to step aside

14:14.762 --> 14:16.345
while you ruin yourself,

14:16.345 --> 14:19.470
but you are not going
to embarrass my office.

14:19.470 --> 14:22.720
I mean, where does this
Kinicki shit come from?

14:22.720 --> 14:24.637
Why this? Why now?

14:24.637 --> 14:26.053
Where's your evidence?

14:27.261 --> 14:29.470
Witness changed
his statement.

14:29.470 --> 14:31.387
-One witness?
-Mm-hmm.

14:31.387 --> 14:33.679
You need more.

14:33.679 --> 14:36.178
He's enough for a subpoena.

14:36.178 --> 14:39.053
I'm talking
to a brick wall.

14:39.053 --> 14:40.970
Find another fucking witness.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.637
You need to tell me what your
dumb fuck of a brother's up to.

14:50.637 --> 14:52.762
Jesus fucking Christ, Cath.

14:52.762 --> 14:55.553
You come in at a ten
sometimes, huh?

14:55.553 --> 14:56.929
What happened?

14:56.929 --> 14:58.178
At the store,

14:58.178 --> 14:59.762
we sent out our knives
for sharpening,

14:59.762 --> 15:02.470
and I caught an edge
opening up a bag of oranges.

15:02.470 --> 15:04.095
[scoffs]

15:04.095 --> 15:05.970
All right, well,
answer me about Jimmy.

15:05.970 --> 15:07.595
I heard you.

15:07.595 --> 15:09.887
I'm bleeding like fucking Christ
on the cross right now.

15:09.887 --> 15:11.845
You're acting like
this is no big deal.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.512
FBI showing up
at your parents' house.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.553
Don't walk away from me.

15:15.553 --> 15:17.011
I'm not--

15:17.011 --> 15:19.595
I got a tampon in
the size of a frigging bus.

15:19.595 --> 15:21.095
You gotta give me
a minute.

15:25.970 --> 15:28.428
Listen, you know Jimmy
better than anybody.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.720
You gotta tell me.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.095
Is he gone for good
this time?

15:33.095 --> 15:35.929
Or is he gonna be showing up,

15:35.929 --> 15:37.512
barging through
my front door again,

15:37.512 --> 15:38.929
asking for shit?

15:38.929 --> 15:40.512
-I don't know.
-[toilet flushes]

15:40.512 --> 15:43.178
Honestly, I know he wants
to see his kids.

15:43.178 --> 15:45.679
Wants to see his kids.

15:45.679 --> 15:48.136
He's dumb as fucking Sheetrock,
your brother.

15:50.136 --> 15:51.428
There's worse
kinds of dumb

15:51.428 --> 15:53.637
than being dumb
in love with your kids.

16:04.512 --> 16:06.136
[sighs]

16:09.637 --> 16:12.261
Ugh. Fucking socks.

16:13.679 --> 16:15.095
Why don't you
let me help you.

16:16.804 --> 16:18.470
Look at this thing.
Jesus.

16:23.637 --> 16:24.929
You know you're kind of cute

16:24.929 --> 16:27.178
when you're all bloody
and being sweet.

16:32.845 --> 16:34.637
I think we should do it.

16:36.011 --> 16:38.470
Come on.
Babe, I'm bleeding.

16:38.470 --> 16:39.762
Yeah.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.887
You think I'm, what, 17?

16:43.887 --> 16:46.136
That I'm scared
of a little blood?

16:46.136 --> 16:47.387
Don't touch me with that.

16:47.387 --> 16:48.679
Yeah.

16:49.845 --> 16:51.845
[both moan softly]

16:56.136 --> 16:57.470
Did you give your brother
money to go?

16:57.470 --> 16:59.053
-Shh! Knock it off.
-Come on, answer me.

16:59.053 --> 17:01.303
Did you give your brother
money to go?

17:01.303 --> 17:03.053
No, I didn't.

17:04.553 --> 17:06.970
-That fucking son of a bitch.
-Jesus!

17:06.970 --> 17:09.095
-Cath, fuck!
-He took the fucking money

17:09.095 --> 17:10.720
from the job,
right out of the fucking--

17:10.720 --> 17:12.637
Cathy, hey! Don't!
You can't just fucking--

17:12.637 --> 17:14.720
I can't just?

17:21.261 --> 17:24.053
How am I supposed to fix this
with one fucking hand?

17:24.053 --> 17:25.178
Huh?

17:27.136 --> 17:28.220
Hmm?

17:30.053 --> 17:31.220
It's all there, right?

17:32.679 --> 17:35.220
-Fuck.
-Hmm?

17:35.220 --> 17:37.011
It means I'm wrong
about the fucking money.

17:37.011 --> 17:38.762
It doesn't mean
I'm wrong about Jimmy.

17:38.762 --> 17:40.637
I bet you your mother knows
exactly where he got the cash.

17:40.637 --> 17:43.095
Leave my mother out of it.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.261
[Cathy]
Somebody's gonna answer me.

17:53.970 --> 17:56.220
[Minogue] So I know
I fucked you up a little bit.

17:56.220 --> 17:58.136
-[Decourcy] Oh, just a little?
-[Minogue] Hey, hold on.

17:58.136 --> 17:59.762
That's why I'm bringing you
down here.

17:59.762 --> 18:02.720
I'm trying to rectify
the situation right now.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.136
There's your guy.

18:04.136 --> 18:05.428
Who?

18:05.428 --> 18:06.512
Bromley Heath.

18:08.428 --> 18:11.261
There is, or should I say was,
the guy who shot at us.

18:12.261 --> 18:13.720
How do you know that's him?

18:15.053 --> 18:16.720
What do you mean?

18:16.720 --> 18:18.553
I recognize him.

18:20.553 --> 18:24.428
Okay, so you're admitting to me
that you lied about Roach.

18:24.428 --> 18:26.345
Yeah, but there's the fucking
guy right there.

18:26.345 --> 18:29.470
-There's the actual guy.
-You motherfucker.

18:29.470 --> 18:32.845
You better pray that you don't
need a fucking thing from me.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.303
Hey, hold on a second,

18:34.303 --> 18:36.261
I'm trying to rectify
the situation between us.

18:36.261 --> 18:39.011
How the fuck does this
help me now?

18:39.011 --> 18:41.929
I figured you wanted to know,
in the interest of justice.

18:47.595 --> 18:49.136
He shoulda shot you.

18:50.720 --> 18:51.720
Hm.

19:04.303 --> 19:05.637
[dials phone]

19:08.011 --> 19:10.845
[phone rings]

19:10.845 --> 19:13.095
-[man, on phone] Martinez.
-Martinez!

19:13.095 --> 19:16.136
The whitest-sounding spic
I know.

19:16.136 --> 19:18.387
Two to five your fucking name
used to be fucking Martin,

19:18.387 --> 19:20.845
you changed it to Martinez
to get assigned to Miami.

19:20.845 --> 19:23.428
Rohr, go find someone else
to offend.

19:23.428 --> 19:28.512
Hey, listen, I need you to pay
a visit to a Miss... hang on.

19:28.512 --> 19:29.762
Corie Struthers.

19:29.762 --> 19:32.887
It's 305 Zamora Avenue.

19:32.887 --> 19:34.303
I'm not your pimp, Jackie.

19:34.303 --> 19:35.887
This is business, fuckhead.

19:35.887 --> 19:37.762
Have you not turned on
a television in ten years?

19:37.762 --> 19:40.261
We got a little drug problem
goin' on down here.

19:40.261 --> 19:42.053
Yeah, knowin' you,
you probably got your sleeves

19:42.053 --> 19:43.720
rolled up like Don Johnson.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.804
Shouldn't you be used
to hard work by now?

19:45.804 --> 19:47.053
What do you want?

19:47.053 --> 19:48.553
Little Miss Corie Struthers

19:48.553 --> 19:51.095
might be hosting
a runaway CI.

19:51.095 --> 19:52.887
Just need somebody
to go by and look for signs

19:52.887 --> 19:54.220
of a coked-out jerkoff.

19:54.220 --> 19:56.220
Which coked-out jerkoff?

19:56.220 --> 19:57.804
His name is Jimmy Ryan.

19:57.804 --> 19:59.720
So you'll send a guy?

19:59.720 --> 20:02.345
Can't right away.

20:02.345 --> 20:05.679
Hey, is this lack of cooperation
some holdover

20:05.679 --> 20:07.845
against the people of Boston
because of JFK

20:07.845 --> 20:09.345
and the fucking Bay of Pigs?

20:09.345 --> 20:11.637
Asswipe, you know
I'm not Cuban.

20:11.637 --> 20:15.053
All right, so you're just being
a typical lazy government fuck.

20:15.053 --> 20:18.136
Okay, just give me
a couple of days. All right?

20:18.136 --> 20:21.261
All right. See, Martin?
Was that so hard?

20:21.261 --> 20:23.637
Listen, have your secretary
send me

20:23.637 --> 20:25.887
a couple boxes of Cubans
while you're at it, all right?

20:25.887 --> 20:27.261
[call terminates]

20:27.261 --> 20:28.387
Mm-hmm.

20:31.261 --> 20:32.387
[sniffs]

20:33.845 --> 20:34.929
Good night, Al.

20:45.929 --> 20:47.512
Hey, you ever go home?

20:47.512 --> 20:49.387
Home?

20:49.387 --> 20:51.095
You mean my parents' house?

20:51.095 --> 20:53.095
I'm steering clear.

20:53.095 --> 20:56.470
My sister's over
with her, uh, her fiancé.

20:56.470 --> 20:58.762
And if I go home,

20:58.762 --> 21:01.970
then I got to hear about every
eligible bachelor

21:01.970 --> 21:04.679
that's in a 15-mile radius.

21:04.679 --> 21:06.512
Uh...

21:06.512 --> 21:08.804
Tommy Hayes isn't enough.

21:08.804 --> 21:10.512
For what?

21:10.512 --> 21:12.804
To convene
a grand jury.

21:12.804 --> 21:15.345
We need another witness.

21:15.345 --> 21:17.303
Think you could pull
a second miracle?

21:18.303 --> 21:19.720
Do I have a choice?

21:21.136 --> 21:22.470
No.

21:25.387 --> 21:28.178
Kid runs into your church,

21:28.178 --> 21:32.261
gets shot four times
in your church.

21:32.261 --> 21:34.011
Your shooters run
right by you,

21:34.011 --> 21:35.970
and you have no idea
what they look like?

21:35.970 --> 21:38.470
No.

21:38.470 --> 21:40.762
You don't know anyone that knows
the victim or his family?

21:42.970 --> 21:44.804
They really got the best
and brightest at the BPD,

21:44.804 --> 21:46.095
don't they?

21:47.011 --> 21:48.970
I think what
the reverend means

21:48.970 --> 21:51.095
is he's already told
the other police officers

21:51.095 --> 21:52.887
everything he knows.

21:52.887 --> 21:54.512
What about you?

21:54.512 --> 21:56.595
You were sitting in a pew,
right? What did you see?

21:56.595 --> 22:00.220
I'm sure what I said that day
is in your file.

22:00.220 --> 22:01.679
I have nothing to add.

22:03.512 --> 22:05.220
You think I want
to be here?

22:05.220 --> 22:07.845
I don't think
about you at all.

22:07.845 --> 22:10.845
Detective, is there anything
else we can do for you?

22:10.845 --> 22:13.512
I don't know yet.

22:13.512 --> 22:15.804
But I'll probably
be back.

22:15.804 --> 22:17.553
In the meantime,

22:17.553 --> 22:18.762
God bless you both.

22:41.178 --> 22:42.762
You got a humidifier?

22:42.762 --> 22:45.553
Humidifier can't cure
nightmares.

22:45.553 --> 22:48.553
What, you think I don't know
about the nightmares?

22:49.970 --> 22:51.637
My kid talks to me,
all right?

22:51.637 --> 22:54.261
He comes to me
when he's worried.

22:54.261 --> 22:56.011
And when Frankie comes to you
all worried,

22:56.011 --> 22:57.303
what do you say?

22:57.303 --> 22:59.970
You asking my advice?

22:59.970 --> 23:02.512
I'm saying I don't know
what to do about the nightmares.

23:02.512 --> 23:05.095
What's going on in your house
causing them anyway?

23:05.095 --> 23:07.303
Fine. Play dumb.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.345
You know this problem
didn't start in my household.

23:10.345 --> 23:12.428
You raised one winner
and one loser.

23:12.428 --> 23:14.887
Cathy, I don't know
where Jimmy is.

23:14.887 --> 23:17.178
I don't know
what Jimmy's doing.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.136
And if I did know,

23:19.136 --> 23:20.762
I wouldn't tell you
anyway

23:20.762 --> 23:23.178
'cause you're getting
on my goddamn nerves.

23:23.178 --> 23:24.970
So go the fuck away.

23:24.970 --> 23:26.929
All right. Fine.

23:26.929 --> 23:29.387
But for the record,
you're the pain in the ass.

23:29.387 --> 23:31.595
And you're gonna miss me
when I'm gone.

23:31.595 --> 23:34.762
Oh, I would love to put
that theory to the test.

23:34.762 --> 23:36.261
[heavy sigh]

23:37.637 --> 23:39.261
[woman]
Take care, see you tomorrow.

23:39.261 --> 23:41.303
[man] G'night, hon.
Take care. Six a.m.

23:41.303 --> 23:43.095
[overlapping chatter]

23:43.095 --> 23:44.261
[man]
Congrats on the tip.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.261
[man] I'll talk
to you guys later.

23:52.261 --> 23:54.387
[woman]
Good night, Brian.

23:54.387 --> 23:56.261
[woman]
Cheers, good night!

23:56.261 --> 23:58.845
[man] Thanks for sharing.
Some beautiful stuff today.

23:58.845 --> 24:00.220
[hammering]

24:04.845 --> 24:07.261
What are you doing, Dad?

24:07.261 --> 24:09.970
You put that thing in
two days ago.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.470
[sighs]

24:13.303 --> 24:15.929
Let's just say your mother
wasn't too pleased.

24:15.929 --> 24:16.970
Hmm?

24:16.970 --> 24:18.804
You can say that.

24:18.804 --> 24:20.845
I say she's batshit.

24:20.845 --> 24:22.553
[chuckles]

24:24.512 --> 24:27.011
I'm not gonna tell her
you said that

24:27.011 --> 24:29.470
if you don't tell her
that I laughed.

24:33.845 --> 24:35.345
I like your face.

24:35.345 --> 24:36.845
Come over here.

24:36.845 --> 24:38.303
Let's take a look.

24:42.845 --> 24:44.679
Yeah.

24:46.428 --> 24:48.178
My daughter looks
exotic.

24:59.553 --> 25:01.261
Just had to answer the phone,
didn't you?

25:01.261 --> 25:03.178
She's your mother.

25:03.178 --> 25:06.011
Don't I get points
for being a good son-in-law,

25:06.011 --> 25:08.178
inviting her and Todd to dinner.

25:08.178 --> 25:10.053
[Siobhan] Those two
have been calling me nonstop

25:10.053 --> 25:11.679
since the shooting...

25:11.679 --> 25:13.887
-[door closes]
-...checking to see if I'm okay.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.261
So?

25:15.261 --> 25:16.595
Let 'em see
that you're okay.

25:16.595 --> 25:18.929
I bet Mom was thrilled
when you answered the phone,

25:18.929 --> 25:20.720
knew she'd get her way.

25:20.720 --> 25:24.053
Eh, saying no to Eloise Hastings
is a lot harder

25:24.053 --> 25:27.303
than saying no to you,
so... I have no shame.

25:28.845 --> 25:30.136
Weak?

25:30.136 --> 25:31.804
Inept?

25:31.804 --> 25:33.970
Did you know he was going
to write this shit about me?

25:33.970 --> 25:36.512
-Who?
-Who? Who else?

25:36.512 --> 25:38.553
Punk-ass Reverend Fields.

25:40.804 --> 25:42.720
Baby, look,

25:42.720 --> 25:45.136
I need you to end your
relationship with this man

25:45.136 --> 25:46.720
once and for all.

25:47.970 --> 25:49.428
[sighs]

25:49.428 --> 25:51.303
Siobhan.

25:51.303 --> 25:53.303
The Genesis Coalition
is bigger than Fields.

25:53.303 --> 25:54.303
The--?

25:54.303 --> 25:55.345
He's one person

25:55.345 --> 25:56.679
on a long list of ministers

25:56.679 --> 25:58.261
who want to stop the violence
in this town.

25:58.261 --> 26:00.178
He called me a house nigger
in public.

26:00.178 --> 26:02.804
Now he's writing it
in print.

26:02.804 --> 26:04.929
I need to prepare
for a grand jury investigation.

26:04.929 --> 26:07.136
This hurts
my credibility.

26:07.136 --> 26:09.345
[scoffs] I thought we were
better than this.

26:09.345 --> 26:10.428
We are!

26:10.428 --> 26:11.929
Better than this.
Better than him.

26:11.929 --> 26:13.929
No, I mean,
I thought we were stronger

26:13.929 --> 26:16.053
than our jobs or your...

26:16.053 --> 26:18.345
Or...

26:18.345 --> 26:19.553
or what, Siobhan?
Or my what?

26:19.553 --> 26:20.595
Ego.

26:22.887 --> 26:24.595
If you can't get
behind the coalition,

26:24.595 --> 26:27.428
why talk about changing
the face of Boston?

26:27.428 --> 26:30.303
Progress comes
at a personal cost.

26:30.303 --> 26:32.595
If we avoid every person
who offends us,

26:32.595 --> 26:35.595
then neither one of us are going
to accomplish a damn thing.

26:35.595 --> 26:38.136
We can't avoid them.

26:38.136 --> 26:40.804
But we don't have to kiss
their asses, right?

26:45.470 --> 26:47.220
[whispers]
I'll say something.

26:49.345 --> 26:51.804
Something like,
"Go fuck yourself"?

26:52.970 --> 26:54.929
[scoffs]

26:54.929 --> 26:56.261
Hmm?

26:58.845 --> 27:00.679
I'll get him to shut up.

27:00.679 --> 27:02.970
[keys jingle]

27:02.970 --> 27:04.261
Thank you.

27:07.220 --> 27:08.637
You're welcome.

27:13.595 --> 27:14.970
[door opens]

27:17.011 --> 27:18.595
[door closes]

27:22.929 --> 27:25.387
Again?

27:25.387 --> 27:27.470
Yeah, see,
I'm like herpes, Doc.

27:27.470 --> 27:28.762
You're unfortunate enough
to get me,

27:28.762 --> 27:30.428
I'm never going away.

27:34.345 --> 27:36.512
Must be a relief
not to have them.

27:36.512 --> 27:38.845
-What?
-Herpes.

27:41.470 --> 27:43.804
You left a message
at my house...

27:43.804 --> 27:45.845
That you don't have herpes.

27:47.345 --> 27:49.845
Okay, let's lay aside
for the moment

27:49.845 --> 27:51.804
the question of how fucking dumb
you have to be

27:51.804 --> 27:53.428
to leave me a message
like that,

27:53.428 --> 27:55.053
and let's focus
on what's important here.

27:55.053 --> 27:56.553
What did you say?

27:56.553 --> 27:59.512
That you do not have
genital herpes.

27:59.512 --> 28:01.345
Fuck me.

28:01.345 --> 28:02.679
Jeez.

28:02.679 --> 28:04.720
Most men hear that,
they're happy.

28:17.595 --> 28:18.970
Hey.

28:18.970 --> 28:21.762
I just took a giant dump
in your bathroom,

28:21.762 --> 28:24.053
and forgot
to Windex the seat.

28:24.053 --> 28:25.303
You're a fucking pig.

28:27.595 --> 28:29.887
And you're a lousy
message-taker.

28:32.470 --> 28:34.053
So, what now?

28:35.303 --> 28:37.053
Nothing.

28:37.053 --> 28:38.887
You got me.

28:38.887 --> 28:40.804
I'm impressed.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.011
I'm going to have
to worry about this

28:44.011 --> 28:45.762
the rest of my life,
aren't I?

29:01.720 --> 29:03.553
Captain Lewis.

29:03.553 --> 29:07.136
I'd like to talk to you about
the shooting at the church.

29:07.136 --> 29:08.553
I'm not working that case.

29:08.553 --> 29:10.053
I heard you were present.

29:10.053 --> 29:12.095
And I gave a statement
to the police.

29:13.345 --> 29:15.387
But did you see this shit?

29:18.553 --> 29:19.929
Oh, this shit?

29:20.929 --> 29:22.178
I saw this shit.

29:25.595 --> 29:27.804
This holy asshole
is blaming

29:27.804 --> 29:30.136
the cops and prosecutors for
the world's every fucking sin.

29:30.136 --> 29:31.512
For human goddamn nature.

29:31.512 --> 29:32.929
Brother, brother,
he may as well blame us

29:32.929 --> 29:34.804
for all the shit
that happened with Tyson.

29:34.804 --> 29:37.804
Fields keeps standing up acting
the same, preaching against us.

29:37.804 --> 29:39.637
People are gonna start
to believe him.

29:39.637 --> 29:41.637
Articulate fucker
that he is.

29:41.637 --> 29:43.804
Fucking Jesse Jackson wannabe.

29:43.804 --> 29:46.303
Jesse Jackson
doesn't play in Boston.

29:46.303 --> 29:47.387
[scoffs]

29:47.387 --> 29:48.804
Understand me, Ward.

29:50.762 --> 29:54.261
Fields cannot be the face
of our community.

29:56.136 --> 29:57.553
Will not.

29:59.387 --> 30:00.887
So, what do we do?

30:02.762 --> 30:05.303
My wife is gonna talk to him.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.762
Yeah. Talk.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.345
That's the Christian way.

30:09.345 --> 30:11.053
But when that fails,

30:11.053 --> 30:14.095
we're going to barbecue
the motherfucker's balls.

30:28.261 --> 30:31.011
This Father Bender sounds like
a royal twat.

30:31.011 --> 30:34.845
Why are you going to a priest
for advice anyway?

30:34.845 --> 30:36.512
I don't know.

30:36.512 --> 30:38.679
Aren't priests supposed to be,
you know, helpful?

30:38.679 --> 30:40.595
Wise?

30:40.595 --> 30:43.762
They're just men who think God
speaks through their bad breath.

30:43.762 --> 30:44.845
-[laughs]
-Looks like you ladies

30:44.845 --> 30:46.845
are having a grand old time.

30:48.387 --> 30:50.428
-Get out of there, Cabot.
-Quality control.

30:50.428 --> 30:52.053
I don't want you
messing up those trays

30:52.053 --> 30:53.345
before the event.

30:53.345 --> 30:54.470
Have a drink.

30:54.470 --> 30:56.220
[Cabot] Hm.

30:56.220 --> 30:57.553
Get me a prosecco.

30:57.553 --> 31:00.387
-Jenny?
-Oh, uh, nothing for me, thanks.

31:00.387 --> 31:02.428
I-I totally suck at this,
don't I?

31:02.428 --> 31:04.053
Just be honest.

31:04.053 --> 31:06.428
A little less Quincy,
little more Beacon Hill.

31:06.428 --> 31:07.845
[laughs]

31:11.178 --> 31:14.053
Jen, you've been sad
for too long.

31:14.053 --> 31:16.804
Talk to someone
who can actually help.

31:16.804 --> 31:18.428
You ever hear
of a therapist?

31:18.428 --> 31:20.011
Oh, not a chance.

31:20.011 --> 31:21.845
Jackie would notice
the money being spent,

31:21.845 --> 31:23.553
he'd start asking questions,

31:23.553 --> 31:25.261
and then he'd start
dishing out answers.

31:25.261 --> 31:28.387
You can't make all your
decisions based on Jackie.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.428
You need your own
cash flow.

31:31.428 --> 31:33.053
Get a job.

31:33.053 --> 31:35.637
Oh, says the woman who last
worked shucking oysters

31:35.637 --> 31:38.095
at Legal Sea Foods in '69.

31:38.095 --> 31:39.303
[laughs]

31:39.303 --> 31:41.303
I sucked at shucking,
remember?

31:41.303 --> 31:42.637
[laughs]

31:42.637 --> 31:45.845
We're not talking
about me, though.

31:45.845 --> 31:48.261
I'm not the one
kneeling in church

31:48.261 --> 31:49.929
hoping to change
my sex life.

31:52.095 --> 31:55.220
You were so happy when you were
studying to be a teacher.

31:55.220 --> 31:58.679
Yeah, but then I,
uh, I got pregnant.

31:58.679 --> 32:01.220
You're not pregnant anymore,
Jen.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.470
I can't just
go be a teacher.

32:03.470 --> 32:05.095
Why not?

32:07.387 --> 32:08.428
Thanks.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.303
You need something to do,
or you're going to go crazy.

32:13.303 --> 32:15.637
Why do you think
I host these fundraisers?

32:15.637 --> 32:17.929
My friends get drunk
for a good cause.

32:17.929 --> 32:20.553
Cab gets celebrated
for being charitable.

32:20.553 --> 32:21.845
And I have somewhere
to put my energy

32:21.845 --> 32:24.345
when he makes me
wanna fucking scream.

32:24.345 --> 32:26.470
You ever hear
of a red prosecco?

32:27.970 --> 32:29.136
[sighs]

32:31.804 --> 32:34.970
I finished my initial outreach
to area community centers

32:34.970 --> 32:36.929
in other churches.

32:36.929 --> 32:39.970
Today, I'd like to discuss
your involvement.

32:41.470 --> 32:44.178
My involvement
is absolute.

32:44.178 --> 32:46.261
What I mean is,

32:46.261 --> 32:49.387
blaming the people who run
the city's institutions,

32:49.387 --> 32:51.387
the police and the press,

32:51.387 --> 32:52.970
you know where that leads?

32:55.053 --> 32:57.387
Educate me.

32:57.387 --> 32:59.845
Racist cops storming
into black neighborhoods,

32:59.845 --> 33:02.011
arresting anyone a shade darker
than them.

33:02.011 --> 33:03.762
You have more
than your congregation

33:03.762 --> 33:05.261
listening now,
Reverend, so...

33:05.261 --> 33:08.095
please try
to nuance your message.

33:09.595 --> 33:12.178
Did your husband
put you up to this?

33:14.720 --> 33:16.804
You called him a house nigger.

33:16.804 --> 33:18.720
If we're to work together,

33:18.720 --> 33:20.595
that's unacceptable
behavior.

33:20.595 --> 33:22.553
[knock on door]

33:22.553 --> 33:24.178
Sorry I'm late.

33:24.178 --> 33:25.345
No.

33:25.345 --> 33:28.011
Your timing
is exceptional.

33:31.679 --> 33:33.220
Let's get down
to business.

33:33.220 --> 33:35.428
I have some ideas
on social events,

33:35.428 --> 33:37.428
all of which
involve food.

33:37.428 --> 33:40.261
People are more likely to
show up if there's a free meal.

33:40.261 --> 33:42.178
[audio fading out] That leads
to community building,

33:42.178 --> 33:44.178
plus they listen better
when their mouths are full.

33:44.178 --> 33:45.804
[Fields, laughing]
Yes.

33:45.804 --> 33:47.011
Yes.

33:47.011 --> 33:49.887
Go on.
[indistinct chatter]

33:49.887 --> 33:51.345
[Minogue]
You don't remember who you saw

33:51.345 --> 33:52.762
in the church that day?
Not anyone?

33:52.762 --> 33:54.470
Maybe being afraid
of catching a stray bullet

33:54.470 --> 33:55.804
has fucked up my memory.

33:55.804 --> 33:57.470
-Just tell me what you saw.
-Why?

33:57.470 --> 33:59.553
-The fuck do you care?
-You know what? I don't care.

33:59.553 --> 34:00.804
I don't give a fuck.

34:00.804 --> 34:02.595
You want to let
these killers go? Fine.

34:02.595 --> 34:05.261
I don't give a fuck about you,
your church,

34:05.261 --> 34:06.720
Reverend fucking Fields.

34:07.804 --> 34:09.387
What about Fields?

34:09.387 --> 34:11.178
He's dog shit on my shoe.

34:12.470 --> 34:14.261
I could tell you
about him.

34:14.261 --> 34:15.720
Yeah.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.428
What do you want
to tell me?

34:17.428 --> 34:19.929
Ain't what he says he is.

34:21.679 --> 34:23.345
[phones ringing]

34:25.679 --> 34:27.261
You can stop searching.

34:29.303 --> 34:31.428
Sheik Sheehan.

34:31.428 --> 34:35.261
History of assault dating back
to 1980.

34:35.261 --> 34:36.929
A long list.

34:36.929 --> 34:38.387
Must be a hothead.

34:38.387 --> 34:40.512
Associate of Thomas Hayes.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.261
Perfect.

34:42.261 --> 34:45.345
I'm not seeing anything here
that connects him to Kinicki.

34:45.345 --> 34:48.136
Okay, these are all
assault charges, right?

34:48.136 --> 34:50.762
Aggravated assault,
assault and battery.

34:50.762 --> 34:52.929
But something changes here.

34:52.929 --> 34:56.470
In May of 1988,
Sheehan gets a DUI.

34:56.470 --> 35:00.470
From that point on,
it's alcohol-related crimes.

35:00.470 --> 35:03.178
DUIs, public intox.

35:03.178 --> 35:05.261
Two years of that,
and then suddenly

35:05.261 --> 35:07.136
alcohol is nowhere
to be found.

35:07.136 --> 35:08.387
It's out of the picture.

35:08.387 --> 35:09.845
So?

35:09.845 --> 35:13.387
So, the date of the first DUI

35:13.387 --> 35:18.428
is immediately after the
disappearance of Kelly Kinicki.

35:18.428 --> 35:20.845
The disappearance
drove him to drink.

35:20.845 --> 35:22.595
And then what?

35:22.595 --> 35:24.679
Time healed the wound?

35:24.679 --> 35:25.929
He sobered up.

35:25.929 --> 35:27.220
How do you know?

35:27.220 --> 35:30.011
I followed him
yesterday.

35:30.011 --> 35:31.970
I saw him coming out
of an AA meeting.

35:34.136 --> 35:35.470
Well, these are good ideas,
Rachel,

35:35.470 --> 35:37.804
but until we can prove
a connection to Kinicki,

35:37.804 --> 35:39.470
that's all they are.

35:39.470 --> 35:40.804
[sighs]

35:43.053 --> 35:45.303
[mother]
Jenny, you got a visitor!

35:45.303 --> 35:46.845
Ma, I'll be right down.

35:51.011 --> 35:52.428
[sighs]

36:03.428 --> 36:05.929
-Who's here?
-[mother] Take a look.

36:10.804 --> 36:12.136
Ma.

36:13.178 --> 36:15.970
Ma, Ma, what's he doing here?

36:15.970 --> 36:18.470
Got excited for a second.

36:18.470 --> 36:22.095
Thought you'd finally decided to
step out on your loser husband

36:22.095 --> 36:24.470
with a nice young
piece of ass.

36:24.470 --> 36:27.053
Ma, you're talkin'
about a priest.

36:27.053 --> 36:29.929
Good thing, too.
You can just call him Father.

36:29.929 --> 36:33.303
He has one of those
unpronounceable mick names.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.095
Oh, wait, don't you use those.

36:37.095 --> 36:39.011
What's wrong with these?

36:39.011 --> 36:41.303
Nothing. They're the best ones.
Here, use the good ones.

36:41.303 --> 36:43.720
You don't use the best ones
for a priest,

36:43.720 --> 36:45.011
who you saving them for?

36:45.011 --> 36:46.637
Cardinal or above.

36:50.887 --> 36:52.470
Ah. Thanks, Ma.

36:54.387 --> 36:55.387
[sighs]

36:56.887 --> 36:58.595
Hi, Father Doyle.
How you doing?

36:58.595 --> 37:00.387
I hope I'm not
interrupting your day.

37:00.387 --> 37:02.387
Oh, no. Just laundry.

37:14.053 --> 37:16.261
So, uh, what can I
do for you?

37:17.845 --> 37:19.929
The way things went
the other day,

37:19.929 --> 37:21.970
you shouldn't be leaving
the church feeling worse

37:21.970 --> 37:23.261
than when you came in.

37:24.637 --> 37:26.929
That obvious, huh?

37:26.929 --> 37:30.845
I'd be happy to--
honored to-- to counsel you,

37:30.845 --> 37:32.804
to help you in any way
that I can.

37:32.804 --> 37:34.970
All due respect, Father,

37:34.970 --> 37:37.220
I'm getting sick of men
telling me what to do.

37:38.261 --> 37:39.595
That's fair enough.

37:39.595 --> 37:41.553
But Father Bender
is Father Bender.

37:41.553 --> 37:43.428
He's not
the Catholic Church.

37:43.428 --> 37:46.136
He and I don't share the same
point of view on everything.

37:46.136 --> 37:47.595
You didn't speak up

37:47.595 --> 37:50.470
when he blamed me
for my husband's sins.

37:52.720 --> 37:55.970
I'm not from Ireland,
I'm from Northern Ireland.

37:55.970 --> 37:57.303
Speaking up
can get you killed.

38:03.136 --> 38:06.428
If talking isn't the answer,
then what else can I do for you?

38:12.178 --> 38:13.887
Answer me this, Father.

38:16.011 --> 38:18.470
Am I too old
to start over again?

38:20.011 --> 38:22.762
No. Not at all.

38:24.804 --> 38:26.929
Then how do I start?

38:30.178 --> 38:34.345
You take an honest,
even brutal look at yourself.

38:35.887 --> 38:37.762
Savor what gives you joy.

38:37.762 --> 38:39.845
Confront what doesn't.

38:41.095 --> 38:42.845
Rely on your friends.

38:42.845 --> 38:46.095
And I hope you'll
consider me one.

38:51.261 --> 38:53.345
[Siobhan]
He got angry.

38:53.345 --> 38:56.512
Reverend Fields does not like
to be criticized.

38:56.512 --> 38:58.011
Who does?

38:58.011 --> 38:59.762
Now I'm really not in the mood
for my mother tonight.

38:59.762 --> 39:01.345
Me neither.

39:02.303 --> 39:03.679
You said it first.

39:03.679 --> 39:05.970
[scoffs]
I'm allowed to. She's my mother.

39:06.929 --> 39:08.512
[doorbell buzzes]

39:11.512 --> 39:13.804
The pro bono stuff's
a challenge.

39:13.804 --> 39:15.762
I have to prove to the partners
that the cause is worth me

39:15.762 --> 39:17.178
losing the billable hours,

39:17.178 --> 39:19.845
so there's zero
margin for error.

39:19.845 --> 39:21.220
Especially being me.

39:21.220 --> 39:23.095
Like I told you,
take your time.

39:23.095 --> 39:24.387
You just got
this position.

39:24.387 --> 39:26.053
You can't change the world
all at once,

39:26.053 --> 39:27.887
not if you're pissin'
your bosses off.

39:27.887 --> 39:30.220
Imagine if someone had said that
to you when you were my age?

39:30.220 --> 39:32.970
Oh, you'd have hit them upside
the head with your protest sign.

39:32.970 --> 39:34.845
-[all laugh]
-Sounds about right.

39:34.845 --> 39:36.428
Uh-huh.

39:36.428 --> 39:38.303
I wish we could have seen you
in action. All fired up.

39:38.303 --> 39:40.887
I would have loved
to have seen that too.

39:40.887 --> 39:44.387
The legend of Eloise Knowles
Quays Hastings.

39:44.387 --> 39:46.845
That's right, baby.

39:46.845 --> 39:48.679
I still care.

39:48.679 --> 39:51.595
But I-I've learned
what works and what doesn't.

39:53.053 --> 39:54.720
The world got small.

39:54.720 --> 39:57.804
Gotta look after your own first
to keep them safe.

39:57.804 --> 40:00.428
We've been worrying
about you since the shooting.

40:00.428 --> 40:03.220
You live up here, you still go
to church down there.

40:03.220 --> 40:06.720
Guys, I'm fine. We're fine.

40:06.720 --> 40:09.512
You'll understand
when you're a parent.

40:09.512 --> 40:13.470
Well, just hitting all
the talking points tonight, huh?

40:13.470 --> 40:15.345
[Eloise] You two would make
some cute babies.

40:15.345 --> 40:18.261
Decourcy, you want kids?

40:20.053 --> 40:22.261
Yeah, someday. Yeah.

40:22.261 --> 40:25.261
You're both just
too busy, though.

40:25.261 --> 40:26.929
All right, I'm gonna say this
once and let it go.

40:26.929 --> 40:28.720
Oh, only once, huh?

40:28.720 --> 40:30.428
Your dad would have loved
a grandchild.

How are you doing?

40:47.929 --> 40:49.470

40:49.470 --> 40:51.303
[Rachel] Excuse me.

41:00.136 --> 41:01.887

Welcome, everyone.

41:01.887 --> 41:03.261
Nice to see everybody here.

41:03.261 --> 41:07.053
Okay, let's get
the meeting started.

41:07.053 --> 41:08.387
First time?

41:08.387 --> 41:10.136
How'd you know?

41:10.136 --> 41:12.387
We've all been there,
every single one of us.

41:12.387 --> 41:13.929
It's a tough place to be.

41:13.929 --> 41:15.011
Mm-hmm.

41:15.011 --> 41:16.679
Where you from?

41:18.720 --> 41:21.053
You asking me what I am?

41:21.053 --> 41:22.637
Is that what
you're getting at?

41:22.637 --> 41:25.178
Did I say that?
I asked where you're from.

41:29.261 --> 41:30.595
I'm from Revere.

41:32.011 --> 41:34.053
[laughs]
So, uh,

41:34.053 --> 41:36.303
have you been coming here
a while?

41:36.303 --> 41:38.387
I had to. Work.

41:38.387 --> 41:40.011
Oh.

41:40.011 --> 41:42.387
Yeah. State job.
They paid for rehab.

41:42.387 --> 41:44.887
But I had
to come here after.

41:44.887 --> 41:47.512
And how much longer
you gotta go?

41:49.011 --> 41:52.053
They don't make me
come here anymore.

41:52.053 --> 41:53.637
What about you?

41:53.637 --> 41:56.095
What made you show up?
Why today?

41:56.095 --> 41:57.720
You know, um...

41:59.387 --> 42:03.136
I'm not really ready
to talk about that

42:03.136 --> 42:04.970
-for now, so...
-Yeah.

42:04.970 --> 42:06.512
[laughs nervously]

42:08.804 --> 42:10.679
Do you remember
your first time?

42:10.679 --> 42:14.053
Oh, sure. I was
out of my fucking mind.

42:14.053 --> 42:16.261
Finished a whole bottle of
whiskey right outside that door

42:16.261 --> 42:17.679
before I stumbled in.

42:20.053 --> 42:21.512
Wow.

42:21.512 --> 42:24.136
Something terrible
must have happened.

42:24.136 --> 42:25.679
[sighs]

42:25.679 --> 42:29.303
A friend of mine
had died.

42:30.553 --> 42:32.136
I'm sorry to hear that.

42:32.136 --> 42:33.887
Well, I mean,
he went missing.

42:33.887 --> 42:37.220
We think he's dead,
but who knows?

42:38.929 --> 42:41.512
But that's worse, maybe.

42:41.512 --> 42:43.178
No, never gonna be
any other way.

42:44.428 --> 42:47.345
He was like family, you know?

42:47.345 --> 42:49.011
And when he died, just...

42:51.637 --> 42:54.303
It's hard to find family,
you know?

42:54.303 --> 42:56.011

know you.

42:56.011 --> 42:57.595
