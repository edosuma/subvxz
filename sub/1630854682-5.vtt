WEBVTT

00:00.835 --> 00:02.367
- I found this in your pocket.

00:02.436 --> 00:03.935
Purple rain?

00:03.971 --> 00:06.004
You want to tell me
who you got it from?

00:06.139 --> 00:08.073
- I get the product through
a network of gamers

00:08.075 --> 00:09.241
Called the replicants.

00:09.310 --> 00:13.178
I was about to meet
with my contact, jake mardy,

00:13.180 --> 00:14.345
But then a few days ago,

00:14.382 --> 00:15.880
The whole operation
went offline.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.382
- Jake mardy?

00:17.451 --> 00:18.917
- I mean, I just ask myself,

00:18.919 --> 00:20.485
Like how well do I
really know nathan?

00:20.554 --> 00:22.087
Because you know I was gone
for eight months

00:22.123 --> 00:24.222
And I'm putting a whole lot
of my eggs in his basket.

00:24.224 --> 00:26.291
- Kel, do you ever really
get over your ex?

00:26.327 --> 00:27.860
- Uh... I certainly hope
nathan is over his.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.895
- It's probably hard
for him to talk about.

00:29.897 --> 00:30.863
- Why?

00:30.998 --> 00:32.297
- Oh, he was heartbroken

00:32.299 --> 00:33.331
When vanessa ended things.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.799
Vanessa's my mom,
that's what I call her.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.868
- You've been getting together
with nathan and your mom?

00:36.904 --> 00:39.872
- Just like the last six months,
maybe. Since I started school.

00:40.007 --> 00:42.274
- So... Will you come home
with me tonight?

00:42.343 --> 00:44.142
- Are you gonna invite me
to your next dinner

00:44.178 --> 00:46.010
With tueli and vanessa?

00:46.047 --> 00:47.378
- Kelly...

00:48.348 --> 00:50.982
- I... Just wanted to say
thank you

00:51.018 --> 00:52.084
For letting me crash here.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.485
- Ugh, men...
- Mm-hmm.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.421
(gagging)
- you know what? And women...

00:55.556 --> 00:56.354
(blows raspberry)
- ugh!

00:56.390 --> 00:58.090
(laughing)
- egg beater!

00:58.159 --> 01:00.492
- Egg beater is two words.
- No, it's one word!

01:00.627 --> 01:02.094
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
- Yes!

01:02.096 --> 01:03.629
- This is how it's done,
this is how it's done.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.564
Set that timer, set that timer.
Are we ready?

01:05.566 --> 01:09.033
In three, in two, in one, bam!
Boom!

01:09.070 --> 01:10.169
Here we go.
- Mm-hmm.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.370
Two words, tv show,

01:12.406 --> 01:13.905
Gossip girls!
- Yes!

01:13.974 --> 01:15.040
(sighs)

01:15.709 --> 01:16.708
(chuckling)

01:16.844 --> 01:18.944
- One word.
(gagging)

01:19.079 --> 01:20.579
Hangover!
- Yes!

01:20.714 --> 01:21.847
(laughing)

01:21.916 --> 01:23.181
- Off to a great start!

01:24.085 --> 01:24.983
Two words.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.252
Oh! Britney spears! Yeah!

01:27.387 --> 01:29.822
- Yeah! Okay!
- That's three.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.658
Two words.

01:33.660 --> 01:36.128
Cold. Chicken?

01:36.263 --> 01:37.729
Chicken clucking?

01:37.765 --> 01:38.931
Cold turkey!
- Yeah!

01:39.066 --> 01:41.232
Cold turkey!
(timer ringing)

01:41.268 --> 01:44.202
- Oh, yes!

01:44.271 --> 01:47.939
(both): Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Woo!

01:47.975 --> 01:49.541
- Are you kidding me?
You're cheating,

01:49.610 --> 01:51.809
You got to be cheating.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.211
It's a mind meld,
two peas in a pod,

01:53.280 --> 01:54.746
This is the benefits
of oversharing.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.515
- Yeah, well, you wait.
Next time, I'm gonna bring

01:56.650 --> 01:58.217
My friend jen and we're gonna
kick your ass.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.151
(doorbell ringing)
- who's jen?

01:59.220 --> 02:00.084
- Uh... It's her friend

02:00.121 --> 02:01.085
Since she was a kid,

02:01.122 --> 02:02.821
But no one's beaten skelly!

02:02.956 --> 02:04.222
- Ro, we've got this,
all right?

02:04.258 --> 02:05.323
- Oh, we got this.

02:06.961 --> 02:10.829
- We're just playing
a video game downstairs!

02:10.831 --> 02:15.099
We're playing a video game
downstairs, bring the chips.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.169
- Yeah. I got it, I got it,
I got it.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.370
- Okay, you take it.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.938
(indistinct chatter)

02:23.043 --> 02:24.108
- Kelly?

02:25.646 --> 02:27.045
Kelly, what are you doing?

02:27.781 --> 02:29.514
- We talked about this.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.250
I'm giving you and tueli space.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.918
- No, that's not
what's happening right now.

02:33.053 --> 02:35.053
What's happening right now
is that you're mad at me...

02:36.190 --> 02:37.956
Because I went out with my ex
a few times

02:37.992 --> 02:39.224
While you were out of town,

02:39.226 --> 02:41.192
Because you found out
that she broke up with me

02:41.228 --> 02:42.994
Instead of the other way around!
- Wow!

02:43.030 --> 02:45.163
So, I guess you know
what's happening.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.932
- Can we just talk about this?
- No.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.668
I don't even know what to say
to you right now.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.171
- Okay.

02:54.474 --> 02:55.840
You want space?

02:56.977 --> 02:58.343
I can give you space.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.746
I'll give you all
the space you want.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.383
(door closes)

03:11.225 --> 03:12.557
(sighs)

03:12.626 --> 03:15.193
(upbeat music)

03:21.101 --> 03:23.368
- I had a lot of fun last night.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.169
- Yeah, me too, right?

03:25.206 --> 03:27.572
Trivia night at the crown,
it's always a great time.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.540
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyway, I'll see you later.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.109
- Hey, I wanted to talk
about Saturday.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.512
I was thinking maybe we could
go to the aqualounge.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.648
- Aqualounge on the east side,

03:36.684 --> 03:39.851
Isn't that like a...
Like a swinger's club?

03:39.853 --> 03:41.987
(laughing)
- yeah, only on tuesdays.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.523
On saturdays,
they do shibari workshops,

03:44.658 --> 03:46.458
The art of japanese
rope bondage.

03:46.593 --> 03:49.261
- Wow! Yeah.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.296
Um...
- You know what?

03:52.332 --> 03:53.865
It's not your thing,
never mind.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.267
It's all good,
I'll just go with brett.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.802
- I mean, who said it wasn't
my thing?

03:56.804 --> 03:58.270
It's just, you know,
9 o'clock in the morning,

03:58.339 --> 04:00.539
I just need a minute to wrap
my head around this thing.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.140
- Right.

04:02.176 --> 04:03.207
(clears throat)

04:03.244 --> 04:05.209
- You know I had sex
on a boat once?

04:05.246 --> 04:07.479
Yeah, in the ocean... Or a lake,

04:07.614 --> 04:09.147
But it was a good time,

04:09.149 --> 04:11.616
So it's not like
I'm a prude or anything.

04:11.619 --> 04:12.950
- Oh my god, you guys!

04:12.987 --> 04:14.820
- I was just trying to convince
naz to come with me

04:14.955 --> 04:16.487
To the aqualounge on Saturday.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.390
- Yeah.
- Wait... Hang on,

04:18.525 --> 04:20.091
Aren't we hanging out
on Saturday?

04:21.262 --> 04:23.161
Kidding! We're on Sunday.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.796
Oh my god,
did you see his face?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.732
(chuckling)
- yeah, cool.

04:26.734 --> 04:29.268
Sarah, sara, I...
I gotta go, so...

04:29.403 --> 04:32.704
- Give me your calendar.
It'll take two seconds, come on.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.439
- Yeah.
- Naz, if this is going to fly,

04:34.441 --> 04:35.574
We got to integrate.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.909
The love cats gotta work
as a team.

04:37.945 --> 04:38.976
- Absolutely.

04:42.716 --> 04:43.915
(indistinct chatter)

04:45.119 --> 04:46.250
- Already had one.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.991
Oh.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.095
Morning, team.
Shall we get started?

04:57.164 --> 04:59.197
Jody maleki, university ta

04:59.333 --> 05:01.833
Whose side hustle is selling
purple rain to students.

05:02.869 --> 05:04.369
Apparently, at low doses,
it can enhance

05:04.438 --> 05:06.038
Both mood and focus,

05:06.173 --> 05:07.805
So it's gaining traction
as both a study drug

05:07.841 --> 05:10.242
And a party drug.
Jody says she bought it online

05:10.244 --> 05:14.012
From a replicant member
named jake mardy.

05:14.081 --> 05:17.149
Our job is to find jake,

05:17.151 --> 05:18.550
Get some concrete
evidence against him,

05:18.619 --> 05:20.819
Arrest him and find out
who's bringing this stuff

05:20.821 --> 05:22.153
Into the country.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.756
Unfortunately, jody's never
met jake in person,

05:24.891 --> 05:27.492
However, I managed to find
two jake mardys,

05:27.528 --> 05:29.727
Both of whom have drug records.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.763
So, I'm thinking we put
a team on each...

05:31.898 --> 05:33.231
(phone ringing)

05:33.267 --> 05:34.299
Excuse me.

05:36.103 --> 05:36.968
Hello?

05:37.805 --> 05:39.504
Yeah, I'll be right there.

05:39.540 --> 05:43.041
Uh... Pick a jake? Any jake.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.909
Watch them, see who's coming
and going,

05:44.945 --> 05:46.378
Bump 'em if you can,
I gotta go.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.979
- Two, two.

05:49.316 --> 05:52.984
- Okay. Can we at least
look at them before we choose?

05:54.455 --> 05:56.120
- Finders keepers.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.990
- So, I just got a call
from a doctor fatima sharma

05:59.026 --> 06:00.658
At the kornfeld forensic
chemistry institute.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.661
She has the purple rain
chemical analysis ready,

06:03.663 --> 06:07.065
But she... Wants to discuss
the results in person.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.333
- Great. Can I put naz on it?

06:09.370 --> 06:11.636
- No, no, she asked
for you specifically.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.272
- Okay. Works for me.

06:15.609 --> 06:19.144
- Oh, uh-uh, don't bother,
just... Take that one.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.213
Hey, if it's okay with you,

06:22.249 --> 06:23.782
I'd rather just work
in the office today.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.484
- What, you don't want to come
to the jake recce?

06:25.619 --> 06:27.619
What? No, come on, come on,
come on! Skelly in the house!

06:27.621 --> 06:28.886
- I...
- I'm feeling lucky!

06:30.090 --> 06:31.756
- I think I need to talk
to nathan.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.491
Thanks.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.561
- Hey. Sorry, what did I miss?

06:36.696 --> 06:38.830
- Nothing major, but I'm sure
sam can fill you in on the way,

06:38.965 --> 06:40.832
Is it cool?
- Yeah, sure.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.572
- This jake mardy
is 66 years old,

06:47.608 --> 06:50.174
Do you really think he's selling
purple rain online?

06:50.210 --> 06:51.976
- I don't know, you never
really can tell

06:52.012 --> 06:54.045
With these over 60s
because one time, judy and I,

06:54.114 --> 06:55.781
We flew to florida
to surprise my grandparents

06:55.916 --> 06:57.449
For their anniversary,
I walked with a big bunch

06:57.584 --> 06:58.984
Of balloons and guess what?

06:58.986 --> 07:00.318
We crashed their
swingers' party.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.920
I saw a lot of things
I shouldn't have seen.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.055
I had a lot of questions
that I got no answers for.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.557
- Wow. Wow.
(chuckling)

07:06.427 --> 07:08.459
Actually, this...

07:08.495 --> 07:10.328
May sound kind of weird,

07:10.397 --> 07:12.864
Just because you said
swingers, um...

07:13.567 --> 07:14.666
(inhales deeply)

07:14.735 --> 07:17.268
Sarah wants to take me
to a sex club.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.572
You know... I don't know,

07:20.707 --> 07:23.008
I... I thought that
I was settling into this whole

07:23.010 --> 07:25.409
Polyamory thing,
but like a sex club?

07:25.446 --> 07:27.012
I don't know,
I feel like that's...

07:27.147 --> 07:28.947
Well, I mean,
it's intimidating, you know?

07:30.750 --> 07:32.751
Sorry, I don't... You know,
do you think I should...

07:32.886 --> 07:34.019
- Okay...
- Just answer me,

07:34.154 --> 07:35.754
Do you think I should
go or no way?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.022
- I think... Wow.
- Yeah.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.023
- That there's a... I...

07:40.327 --> 07:41.759
(chuckling)
okay.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.697
Okay, is it like, um...

07:45.699 --> 07:47.632
Is it a good intimidating
or a bad intimidating?

07:47.668 --> 07:50.034
Like, you want to go bungee
jumping or you want to...

07:50.103 --> 07:51.970
Enter a chili dog
eating contest?

07:52.739 --> 07:54.305
- I don't know... Neither?

07:54.341 --> 07:55.640
- Oh.
- Yeah.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.109
- Wait, here we go.
- Whoa.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.310
- What do you want?

07:59.379 --> 08:01.980
You've been here for two hours,
gawking at my house

08:02.115 --> 08:03.448
Like a couple of perverts.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.217
- Do you want to?
- Yeah.

08:06.220 --> 08:07.252
- Okay.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.926
- Okay. Uh... Mr. Jake mardy?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.928
I am detective wazowsky,
this is detective nazeer,

08:16.930 --> 08:18.930
And we just have like a couple
of questions for you and...

08:18.966 --> 08:20.865
Yeah, uh...

08:20.934 --> 08:22.334
I'm just gonna get
right to it,

08:22.469 --> 08:24.869
Have you ever been part
of a criminal organization?

08:24.938 --> 08:27.171
- I was raised catholic,
otherwise no.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.207
- Well, how do you explain
your drug charges

08:30.244 --> 08:31.510
From last year?

08:31.645 --> 08:33.644
- That's why you're here?
(chuckling)

08:34.615 --> 08:35.747
Okay, fine.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.417
Last December, I let
alfie petrello

08:39.486 --> 08:42.754
Keep his stash in my shop
for all of two hours.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.090
Turns out there was a tracker
on the blow.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.859
I got raided,

08:47.861 --> 08:50.095
Told the pigs
that that was a mix-up.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.395
Who do you think they believed?

08:52.566 --> 08:55.467
Alfie senior hired
hotshot lawyers

08:55.602 --> 08:57.835
And I spent christmas
in the can!

08:59.573 --> 09:01.105
Thanks for reminding me!

09:01.141 --> 09:02.440
- Thank you, mr. Mardy.

09:02.476 --> 09:03.842
- Not our guy.
- Not our guy.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.009
- Not our guy.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.711
(phone ringing)

09:06.846 --> 09:08.045
- Go for chase.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.981
<i> (sam): Hey, how's it going</i>
<i> over there with your jake?</i>

09:10.017 --> 09:11.983
- Hard to say, really.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.452
Mid-thirties, big manga fan,

09:14.588 --> 09:15.987
He got a gamer chair
with a rumble pack

09:16.023 --> 09:17.055
<i> Delivered this morning.</i>

09:17.190 --> 09:19.123
<i> - Pretty sweet chair.</i>
<i> - Sweet chair.</i>

09:20.327 --> 09:21.859
- Okay, well, speaking of sweet,

09:21.861 --> 09:23.728
I was just wondering,
are you guys planning on

09:23.764 --> 09:25.263
Hitting up man-stock
this afternoon?

09:25.398 --> 09:26.731
I hear there's a chili dog
eating contest.

09:26.866 --> 09:28.066
Naz and I are willing
to head over

09:28.135 --> 09:29.668
If those dogs are calling.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.269
- That's very generous, sam.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.004
Wanna eat hot dogs at man-stock?

09:33.873 --> 09:34.772
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.240
The dogs are definitely calling.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.477
- Great. Uh... We're gonna
be over there in 20.

09:39.613 --> 09:40.478
- Great.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.547
Hot dogs.
(chuckling)

09:42.549 --> 09:43.547
- Huh?

09:45.319 --> 09:47.052
Thank god,

09:47.054 --> 09:48.919
Finally getting up
to take a pee.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.356
- You try reading
vexed twins: Gentle blasphemy

09:51.425 --> 09:53.158
Not in one sitting.
(sighs)

09:53.160 --> 09:54.425
You can't stop.
- No.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.560
(soft music)

09:55.695 --> 09:57.695
(indistinct chatter)

10:10.177 --> 10:11.909
(phone ringing)

10:15.449 --> 10:17.982
- Hello! I'm doctor fatima
sharma.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.651
Pronouns she and her.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.519
Please, uh... Call me fatima.

10:22.356 --> 10:23.855
- Please.
- Hi there, I'm...

10:23.857 --> 10:27.459
Just shadowing ds greene
on this case, but don't mind me.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.060
- Ah, I won't.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.696
Mentorship is a beautiful thing.
- Mm-hmm.

10:31.698 --> 10:33.231
- I'm thrilled to be working
with you, nathan.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.399
I attended your lecture
on identity theft

10:35.435 --> 10:37.135
At the northeastern
fraud conference,

10:37.137 --> 10:39.237
28 months ago.
- Okay.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.473
- I have an extracurricular
passion for fraud prevention

10:41.608 --> 10:43.340
And I found your thoughts on
voice biometrics

10:43.377 --> 10:45.076
To be quite, uh...

10:45.211 --> 10:46.243
Stirring.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.947
- Uh... Thank you,
it's nice of you to say.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.650
(clears throat)
uh...

10:52.719 --> 10:54.985
So, fatima, you're here
to talk about purple rain?

10:55.622 --> 10:56.721
- I am.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.657
After we received your sample,

10:59.660 --> 11:01.693
Our lab conducted an in-depth
analysis of the drug

11:01.762 --> 11:03.494
That you're calling purple rain,

11:03.530 --> 11:06.063
Which is definitely schedule a.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.166
We've also been using
international wastewater

11:08.301 --> 11:09.600
Analyses to track where new
designer drugs

11:09.670 --> 11:11.636
Are being used and so far,

11:11.771 --> 11:14.438
Purple rain has only been found
in local wastewater.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.907
- So, it's being made in canada.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.842
- We also identified
the precursor chemicals

11:17.878 --> 11:19.778
Used to make the drug
and as you can see,

11:19.913 --> 11:21.913
All of them are legal
in this country.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.715
- But it's not unusual
for designer drugs to be made

11:23.850 --> 11:25.850
From legal chemicals, right?

11:25.852 --> 11:28.319
- No, but the steps required
to make purple rain

11:28.388 --> 11:29.587
Are very sophisticated.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.723
- So, we're likely looking
for someone

11:31.792 --> 11:33.725
With specialized
chemistry knowledge?

11:33.727 --> 11:34.993
- Correct!

11:34.995 --> 11:37.061
I imagine at the very least,
they have a master's degree,

11:37.064 --> 11:39.330
But probably a phd.
- Oh.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.899
- Like me,

11:41.034 --> 11:42.366
First doctor in the family.

11:43.670 --> 11:44.635
- Okay!

11:45.872 --> 11:47.338
- I don't want to assume
anything about your sexuality,

11:47.374 --> 11:49.808
Nathan, but if you do
date women,

11:49.943 --> 11:53.077
Are you single, or open
to new partners at the moment?

11:55.482 --> 11:56.614
- Oh.

11:58.017 --> 11:59.317
Um...

11:59.319 --> 12:02.554
I'm not currently looking
for partners of any gender,

12:02.556 --> 12:04.588
But thank you for asking.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.293
- Okay, so I got sara two
on Saturday,

12:09.329 --> 12:12.230
That means sarah one
on Sunday.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.699
You got... That's Tuesday
and then Thursday...

12:14.768 --> 12:16.234
- Jesus, I don't know
how you keep up.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.836
- You know what?
I don't, really.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.572
Like, I'm not good at this.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.039
You know, I'm...

12:22.075 --> 12:23.174
I'm trying to keep them
all separate,

12:23.243 --> 12:25.976
But then apparently,
I'm supposed to like blend them.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.245
- Wait.
- Integrate them.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.580
- Shh. Hold up. There he is.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.715
(sighs)

12:35.055 --> 12:36.320
(exhales)

12:39.259 --> 12:42.927
- Holy shit! Oh my god!

12:43.062 --> 12:44.562
I know that guy.
- What?

12:44.598 --> 12:46.531
- That's jake benson.
(sigh)

12:46.600 --> 12:48.065
Wow, he...

12:48.101 --> 12:49.467
He finally took
his mom's last name.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.135
He hated his dad.
- Who cares?!

12:51.204 --> 12:52.736
Who is jake benson?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.540
- It's like my old best friend
from high school.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.807
- Are you kidding me right now?

12:56.843 --> 12:58.610
You didn't recognize
that from the file?

12:58.745 --> 13:00.578
- Well, you had the file
and I was on my schedule--

13:00.647 --> 13:01.546
(overlapping arguments)
- ...Your 40 girlfriends!

13:01.615 --> 13:03.747
And maybe we should focus!
Stop it!

13:04.818 --> 13:05.983
Okay.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.086
Are you still friends with him?

13:08.088 --> 13:10.622
- No! We had a falling out
in like the 11th grade,

13:10.757 --> 13:11.890
I haven't seen him
since high school,

13:11.892 --> 13:13.024
What am I supposed to do now?

13:13.093 --> 13:14.792
- I'm going to tell you
what you're supposed to do,

13:14.861 --> 13:16.895
You're going to tell
me everything that
you know about him.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.362
Go.
- He likes... You know,

13:18.431 --> 13:20.064
All-you-can-eat buffets
and two-for-one meals.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.332
- Who doesn't? Be more specific.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.803
- Okay! Uh... He likes
video games, he hates sauce.

13:24.938 --> 13:28.172
Uh... Okay! Uh, he's a really
smart guy, actually,

13:28.241 --> 13:29.707
I mean, he's really
into like japan and like

13:29.843 --> 13:32.177
Ecstasy and stuff like that.
Uh... Oh!

13:32.312 --> 13:34.111
He loved my neighbour's koi pond
growing up

13:34.113 --> 13:36.013
And had a crush on my sister...

13:43.290 --> 13:44.121
- Hi!

13:45.192 --> 13:46.391
I'm sam from koi chicks,

13:46.526 --> 13:49.060
I'm just here for your
pond consultation.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.929
- My what?
- The pond con...

13:50.931 --> 13:52.530
It's 37 harton street, right?

13:53.667 --> 13:55.934
- Yeah, but I didn't...
Schedule anything.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.736
- Ugh, god, I'm so sorry. Ugh.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.139
I have, like, dyscalculia,
so I like invert numbers

14:01.274 --> 14:02.874
Of like dates and addresses
and normally,

14:03.009 --> 14:04.675
My partner, she does
all the consultations.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.577
I... I... I'm sorry.

14:06.646 --> 14:09.614
- Sorry, what...
What kind of consults?

14:09.616 --> 14:11.749
- Uh... Koi ponds.
I'm a pond installer!

14:11.785 --> 14:13.618
(chuckling)
- you know, it's funny

14:13.687 --> 14:15.086
Because I, um...

14:15.155 --> 14:17.154
I've wanted a koi pond
ever since I was a little kid.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.589
- Are you kidding me?
(chuckling)

14:18.592 --> 14:20.291
This is just like... Weird.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.826
Um... Okay, for you,

14:21.961 --> 14:24.228
I'm gonna give you
a complimentary consultation,

14:24.297 --> 14:26.030
Because we have like,
a really great promo

14:26.032 --> 14:28.099
On at the moment.
Uh... Two halves of a pond

14:28.168 --> 14:30.200
For the price of a half.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.837
- So, a full pond
for half... Price?

14:34.841 --> 14:35.706
- That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

14:35.775 --> 14:38.176
Uh... Above grounds
are 800, 850.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.510
For you, my friend,
I'm gonna throw in

14:39.512 --> 14:41.178
A couple of fish.
I'm gonna give you my card

14:41.214 --> 14:42.847
So you can think about it.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.548
I don't have a card,
I don't have a purse.

14:45.585 --> 14:46.851
- Screw it, I'm...
I'm making bank now,

14:46.986 --> 14:48.586
Let's do it!
- Oh my god,

14:48.588 --> 14:50.821
I like your style. Carpe diem!

14:51.491 --> 14:53.023
Carp 'cause of the...

14:53.626 --> 14:54.759
How's tomorrow?

15:00.433 --> 15:02.200
- Detective nazeer,
before you continue

15:02.202 --> 15:05.035
With this case, we need to have
a chat about your friend.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.805
First of all, I need to know
if jake mardy

15:07.807 --> 15:10.074
Knows anything about you
that could become an issue.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.810
- Sure. He knows I got
suspended for tp-ing

15:12.812 --> 15:14.612
The portables in grade ten.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.046
- So no skeletons?

15:16.082 --> 15:18.149
- No.
- Good.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.485
Were you two close?

15:21.521 --> 15:23.687
Did you grow up
in the same neighbourhood?

15:23.723 --> 15:24.789
- Sort of.

15:24.858 --> 15:26.157
Yeah, he was in a high-rise,

15:26.292 --> 15:28.760
I was on a cul-de-sac
a few blocks away.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.062
His family was pretty messed up.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.766
You know, he got caught
for selling ecstasy

15:34.901 --> 15:37.267
And that's when my dad made me
stop hanging out with him.

15:38.905 --> 15:41.238
I just... Kinda felt
like an asshole

15:41.308 --> 15:42.507
For ditching him, you know?

15:43.576 --> 15:45.376
I always hoped
he could turn it around.

15:45.511 --> 15:48.146
This was 20 years ago
and respectfully,

15:48.148 --> 15:49.847
I don't think knowing a guy
in high school

15:49.849 --> 15:51.582
Was a reason to take me
off this case.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.851
- Friendships make things muddy,

15:53.987 --> 15:55.653
Professionally speaking,

15:55.788 --> 15:58.389
You know, whether it be
a colleague or a target.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.724
Maybe your loyalty
gets in the way.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.628
Maybe you tell him
something you shouldn't,

16:03.630 --> 16:06.197
Maybe you make assumptions
about his behaviour

16:06.199 --> 16:08.333
That are no longer
useful or relevant.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.069
Take it from me,

16:11.204 --> 16:13.738
Compartmentalization
is a full-time job.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.073
- I have no loyalty to this guy.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.976
If he's dealing this stuff,
I want to get him for it.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.280
- Fine.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.749
You can, uh, stay in the loop
if you want,

16:24.751 --> 16:27.618
Do some digging, whatever,
but no uc, no surveillance.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.487
Maybe once we get him in,

16:29.622 --> 16:31.155
You can be active
in a different way.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.226
- Got it. Thank you very much.

16:35.361 --> 16:38.029
And listen, I think I can be
very helpful on this case.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.299
- I live in hope.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.133
(chuckles)

16:44.437 --> 16:46.904
- I love my little aquarium,
but I'm thinking that koi,

16:46.973 --> 16:49.040
It's a bridge too far,
even for you.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.541
- No, it's not for me,
it's for work,

16:50.676 --> 16:52.076
Which is why I can't
really talk about it.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.445
I just need to learn
how to install a koi pond.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.647
I mean, that should be
pretty easy and I told my target

16:56.783 --> 16:57.982
That I would build it
for him tomorrow,

16:58.051 --> 16:59.350
So we gotta go!

16:59.485 --> 17:01.018
- See, I don't think
this is a good idea.

17:01.153 --> 17:02.720
- But we're already here,
and plus, you told me

17:02.722 --> 17:04.322
That you wanted me to meet jen,
it's actually perfect.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.457
- I have said that.
- So, what's going on?

17:06.493 --> 17:08.592
- I may have spoken
a little bit too soon.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.994
Jen can be...
A bit possessive.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.162
- She doesn't want to meet me?

17:12.198 --> 17:13.197
- She...

17:14.334 --> 17:15.333
...Doesn't want to meet you.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.602
I'm sorry! Oh, god, she just...

17:17.604 --> 17:20.605
She wants the friendship
to be separate, I guess, I...

17:20.607 --> 17:24.108
- What? Are you kidding me?
I am charming! Look at my cords.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.876
Listen, by the end of this,
we're gonna be braiding

17:25.912 --> 17:27.678
Each other's hair and making
plans for pickleball,

17:27.747 --> 17:29.347
I promise you,
I will not embarrass you.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.548
(sigh)
- fine.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.682
Let's go around back.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.687
(rock music playing)

17:37.890 --> 17:40.357
- My gosh, this place
is beautiful. I can't...

17:41.461 --> 17:43.327
This is amazing.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.495
Are you kidding me?

17:44.564 --> 17:45.963
Is that a neon mushroom?
- Yeah.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.298
Just don't touch anything.
- Look at this dragon.

17:47.433 --> 17:48.733
Look at the horns on this baby.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.635
I am not going home without it.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.069
What?

17:54.307 --> 17:55.239
Jen?

17:55.374 --> 17:56.306
- Can I help you?

17:56.342 --> 17:57.308
- Ha!
(chuckling)

17:57.377 --> 17:59.644
Oh, my gosh! I just want
to hug you.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.044
You know what? I'm coming in.
It's happening.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.546
I'm taking a hug, here we go.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.783
This place is so gorgeous!

18:06.786 --> 18:08.652
- Sorry that we didn't
call first.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.321
Jen, this is sam,
sam, this is jen.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.924
- Hello! Oh, my gosh, this one,

18:13.059 --> 18:14.926
She will not shut up
about you, you know?

18:14.928 --> 18:16.060
Foster sisters,
each other's rock,

18:16.195 --> 18:17.795
A bond forged in trauma.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.597
Actually, I'm really sorry,
that was highly inappropriate.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.600
I just wanted to say to you
it is so nice to meet you.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.835
Hi, I'm sam.
- Sam has a favour to ask.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.005
- I don't even know sam.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.607
- Well, any friend of ro's...

18:29.742 --> 18:31.942
That means we're probably
gonna be best buds!

18:31.978 --> 18:33.644
A rising tide,
it floats all boats.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.679
<i> Mi casa es su casa.</i>
She gets it, she knows,

18:35.748 --> 18:37.615
She's picking up what
I'm putting down, right?

18:47.427 --> 18:48.225
- What do you need?

18:50.130 --> 18:51.662
Oh, wow, we're doing it again,
okay.

18:55.702 --> 18:59.403
- Not a ton of chemistry phds
with drug records. Big surprise.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.572
- Naz, is there any way
jake could be making the drugs?

19:01.608 --> 19:03.107
I mean, you did say
he was brilliant.

19:03.176 --> 19:04.575
- No, not that kind
of brilliant.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.377
The guy failed
grade ten chemistry.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.179
(sighs)
- fatima said whoever's

19:08.181 --> 19:09.914
Making this stuff is a genius.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.449
- Fatima said! Fatima said!

19:13.553 --> 19:15.486
Maybe doctor meet-cute
considers her own skills

19:15.555 --> 19:18.456
A little more rarefied
than they actually are.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.191
Naz, this woman was a whack job.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.327
I mean, fraud prevention
ain't nobody's hobby.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.763
And I mean, nobody finds
voice biometrics stirring.

19:26.799 --> 19:27.965
Do you find it stirring?

19:28.001 --> 19:29.466
- Kelly, what do you care?

19:29.536 --> 19:31.501
Any more information on
jake mardy?

19:32.638 --> 19:36.007
- Uh... Yeah, I mean,
no arrests since 2002,

19:36.142 --> 19:37.341
No known associates,

19:37.476 --> 19:39.476
I haven't been able to find him
on social media yet...

19:40.746 --> 19:42.947
But he does own his house

19:43.016 --> 19:45.416
And he has no source
of legal income

19:45.551 --> 19:47.351
That I can find.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.687
And his parents, they sure as
hell didn't leave him anything.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.021
- Good.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.690
That plus the info from jody

19:52.692 --> 19:53.958
Should be enough
for a general warrant.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.727
I'll go check on that.

20:01.201 --> 20:04.201
- Why do you need to know about
koi for work? Aren't you a cop?

20:04.237 --> 20:05.669
- I'm a detective.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.306
- Like a pet detective?

20:08.441 --> 20:09.573
- Not a pet detective.

20:10.710 --> 20:11.909
I'm working on a case,
an ongoing investigation,

20:11.978 --> 20:13.978
So I can't talk about it.
And I really would love to talk

20:14.047 --> 20:15.779
About it because I'm a real
oversharer, which you would know

20:15.815 --> 20:16.913
If you gave me half a chance.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.584
If you don't want to help me
learn how to install a koi pond,

20:20.620 --> 20:22.186
I'm sure there's lots
of people who could.

20:22.956 --> 20:24.888
- Really? Lots of people?

20:26.192 --> 20:27.825
- Okay, maybe not lots,
like maybe, like other...

20:27.894 --> 20:29.260
- Yeah.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.095
Okay, look, first thing
you need to know about koi

20:32.131 --> 20:34.598
Is that they're basically carp's
cousin tiffany.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.267
Prettier but...
- Oh.

20:36.269 --> 20:37.801
- Just higher maintenance...

20:37.837 --> 20:39.737
And undeniably overrated.
- Okay.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.272
- Do you know how
to pick one up?

20:41.274 --> 20:43.007
- No, I do not.
I do not know how.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.876
- Okay. Just get your hands wet.
- Sure.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.944
- And lift from underneath.
- Yeah.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.948
- Okay, head facing toward you.
- Yes.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.016
- Yep.
- Yes.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.085
- Open your fingers so you
don't bruise the fins.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.820
- Yes.
- Okay, and then the other hand

20:55.955 --> 20:57.688
Just holds the back half.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.156
Okay, okay.
- Yep.

20:59.192 --> 21:00.424
- So, it's not actually
a magical koi,

21:00.493 --> 21:01.692
It needs water to breathe.

21:01.827 --> 21:02.960
- Yes. Yeah. Ah!
- Okay. Yep.

21:03.029 --> 21:03.994
- Yeah.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.630
- All right, sam's out here,
she says she has something

21:06.699 --> 21:07.765
That she wanted to show us.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.767
- No way!

21:11.237 --> 21:13.304
(groovy music)

21:13.439 --> 21:15.406
- Welcome to the pond, master!

21:17.243 --> 21:19.176
- Okay. Koi chicks, really?

21:19.245 --> 21:20.978
- Okay, listen, I know
that it's not the best name,

21:21.047 --> 21:22.913
It's a bit retro,
but it just popped into my head

21:22.915 --> 21:24.482
And this is a bit much,

21:24.484 --> 21:26.249
But it was the only thing
big enough in the impound

21:26.286 --> 21:27.718
That you could move
a whole pond with.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.653
- But how'd you get
my silhouette, though?

21:29.689 --> 21:32.056
- I'll tell you how,
from memory!

21:32.125 --> 21:33.324
(chuckling)

21:33.459 --> 21:35.192
- Okay, that's really
creepy as hell.

21:35.194 --> 21:37.028
- I love the jackets.
You didn't happen

21:37.163 --> 21:38.195
To make any extra, did you?

21:38.264 --> 21:39.930
- Uh... What do you think?

21:50.943 --> 21:52.476
(sighs)

21:52.611 --> 21:54.779
All right, so we'll set up
the pond.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.080
That should be a breeze.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.515
- Then you fondle koi
with jake while I sneak inside,

21:58.517 --> 22:00.150
See if I can find anything
to connect jake

22:00.219 --> 22:01.352
With purple rain.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.155
- All right.
- Nathan, we all good?

22:07.426 --> 22:09.960
Hello? Nathan?

22:09.962 --> 22:11.028
Hello!

22:11.163 --> 22:12.096
- Calm down.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.430
I just gotta get
my earpiece in place.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.399
<i> - You know the best way</i>
<i> to piss someone off?</i>

22:15.468 --> 22:16.633
<i> Tell 'em to calm down.</i>

22:16.669 --> 22:19.503
- Or tell them nothing at all,
that always works great.

22:20.406 --> 22:21.138
- Hey.

22:22.275 --> 22:24.141
Is there a bit
of an energy between you two?

22:24.177 --> 22:25.642
- Energy?

22:26.279 --> 22:27.945
- Romantic energy.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.380
- She's my girlfriend.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.048
Well... My partner...

22:31.117 --> 22:32.716
Partner, part...

22:32.752 --> 22:34.418
Actually, I don't know
what we are right now.

22:34.554 --> 22:35.786
- Nice.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.721
I knew there was a vibe.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.257
Just felt it, you know?
(phone chimes)

22:42.128 --> 22:44.094
(laughing)

22:45.098 --> 22:47.131
- Who are you vibing
with right now?

22:47.133 --> 22:50.267
- Oh, I have a group chat
going with watts and swallows.

22:50.269 --> 22:53.204
(chuckling)
just zinger after zinger.

22:53.339 --> 22:54.538
Constant hilarity.

22:54.673 --> 22:57.074
(laughing)

23:03.049 --> 23:04.748
- Okay, is this the filter
or the pump?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.083
- That's definitely the filter.
It's the pump.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.551
- This is the filter?
- That's the pump.

23:07.686 --> 23:09.553
That's the filter. I don't know.
- Wait, this is the pump?

23:09.589 --> 23:11.088
What's the manual say?
- Well, I lost part of it.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.690
Do you speak japanese?
- Yo, jake!

23:12.692 --> 23:13.824
- Oh, hey.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.560
- What the hell is this?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.296
I thought we were having
a meeting.

23:19.365 --> 23:20.364
- Yeah.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.066
- What are you up to?

23:23.236 --> 23:25.703
- What's happenin'? You know?

23:25.838 --> 23:27.571
Like the joke. And then...

23:27.573 --> 23:29.773
And then, watts replied,
"what's happenin'?"

23:29.809 --> 23:32.643
But way too long,
like so many extra letters.

23:36.449 --> 23:37.648
- Hey, koi chick.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.950
Nice kicks.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.719
Beetroot.
- Yeah, good eye!

23:42.755 --> 23:44.188
You, uh...

23:44.190 --> 23:45.322
Must be a sneakerhead?

23:45.458 --> 23:46.590
- Yeah, a little bit.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.659
Picked up the grateful 3s
last week.

23:48.728 --> 23:50.060
- Nice.
- Now, I just gotta help

23:50.062 --> 23:51.328
My buddy jake here.

23:51.364 --> 23:54.064
You know, before he met me,
he used to shop at payless.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.699
- Oh, come on.
- Yeah, well...

23:55.701 --> 23:57.935
(chuckling)
I was making minimum wage,

23:58.004 --> 23:59.069
So I wasn't gonna...

23:59.071 --> 24:00.604
Spend my paycheque on shoes.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.140
And not everyone
has a trust fund.

24:04.643 --> 24:06.409
- Yeah, those were
the good old days.

24:06.446 --> 24:07.878
Gotta hustle now, right?

24:08.514 --> 24:09.480
Hey.
(chuckling)

24:09.549 --> 24:10.948
- You what I'm saying?

24:10.950 --> 24:12.550
You got a bathroom I could use?

24:12.552 --> 24:13.617
- Yeah, sure.

24:13.752 --> 24:14.952
Just inside, to the right.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.219
- Thanks.

24:18.524 --> 24:19.757
- All right!

24:19.892 --> 24:22.025
What do you say
we name these fish?

24:22.061 --> 24:23.426
- Nathan,

24:23.463 --> 24:25.562
You got a shot of the guy
who just came in the back?

24:25.698 --> 24:27.831
<i> - Yeah, I'm running it</i>
<i> right now.</i>

24:27.834 --> 24:28.832
<i> Any idea who he is?</i>

24:28.901 --> 24:30.634
- Ah, his name is krish,

24:30.636 --> 24:31.902
Maybe he's 35,

24:32.037 --> 24:33.771
Said they had a meeting.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.071
<i> - Working on it.</i>

24:37.777 --> 24:40.043
(tense music)

24:40.813 --> 24:42.045
(sighs)

24:44.316 --> 24:46.383
- They're... Awesome!
(chuckling)

24:47.420 --> 24:48.218
What do you think
we should call them?

24:48.221 --> 24:50.453
- Uh... I got one, I got one.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.256
David schwimmer.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.791
- I love it!
Yeah, david schwimmer.

24:56.462 --> 24:57.895
(♪)

25:04.103 --> 25:06.403
(swing music playing)

25:06.472 --> 25:08.272
- Kel? What... What's going on?
You okay?

25:08.341 --> 25:09.273
- Shh!

25:11.777 --> 25:14.545
Yeah, I'm fine, just trying
to get this lobster to turn off!

25:14.614 --> 25:16.380
(swing music playing)

25:17.116 --> 25:18.215
- What the hell is that?

25:18.284 --> 25:19.649
(music stops)

25:23.422 --> 25:24.688
(tense music)

25:25.224 --> 25:26.423
Jake, seriously?

25:26.425 --> 25:29.093
- Kelly, we got a really bad
case of fin rot out here,

25:29.095 --> 25:30.493
It's terrible,
you should come out!

25:31.731 --> 25:33.496
- Jesus, fin rot? Are they okay?
- Yeah, yeah, it just

25:33.533 --> 25:35.098
Needs to be treated
immediately, like, right away.

25:35.134 --> 25:38.035
Kelly! You can come out and see
the rotten fin, please!

25:38.037 --> 25:39.336
(toilet flushing)

25:39.372 --> 25:41.839
- Hey, did you hear some...
Some music or...

25:41.841 --> 25:43.407
Something like that?
- Oh, that was me singing.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.508
(chuckling)
gotta love those old

25:44.643 --> 25:46.109
Girl groups, right?

25:46.145 --> 25:47.444
- In the bathroom?

25:47.446 --> 25:49.046
- Yeah, you got a problem
with that?

25:49.115 --> 25:50.247
- No, no, no! What...

25:50.382 --> 25:51.915
Hey, whatever...
Whatever works for you.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.249
(chuckling)
- cool, cool.

25:54.453 --> 25:57.387
- You gotta do you, right?
- Yeah! Yeah, got to.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.326
(sighs)
what happened? Everything okay?

26:02.395 --> 26:04.127
- Yeah, we just have like,
a case of fin rot,

26:04.163 --> 26:06.129
So I just wanted
to talk to you about it.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.865
Did you find anything?
Oh, my gosh, bit of a mix-up.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.001
I just consulted with
my colleague over here.

26:11.136 --> 26:12.970
Guess what? It's not fin rot,
it's fin nip. Yay.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.338
So that's some really
good news for you.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.140
And this is what we're gonna do,
we're gonna head out.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.875
Invoice is gonna be in the mail
and you enjoy those fish!

26:18.911 --> 26:20.978
Thank you very much,
it was lovely meeting you both.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.279
Have a wonderful day!
- Yeah.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.253
(krish): So, you're picking up
at yoyo's tonight?

26:29.855 --> 26:30.921
(jake): Yeah.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.690
Yeah, I'll be holding by six.

26:33.526 --> 26:34.324
- Cool.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.060
Enjoy your fish.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.562
- Great, yoyo's at six.

26:38.697 --> 26:41.698
- Yeah. What the hell is yoyo's?
- I have no idea.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.033
Hey, do you want to carry this?

26:43.168 --> 26:43.967
- Oh, no.
- Okay.

26:50.610 --> 26:51.742
Maybe it's the frozen yoghurt
place?

26:51.877 --> 26:53.377
- We've got a problem.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.545
Apparently,
there's construction,

26:54.680 --> 26:55.779
Something about a busker.

26:55.914 --> 26:56.980
Spin team lost him,

26:57.049 --> 26:59.316
But we know jake has a pickup
at six pm

26:59.451 --> 27:00.851
At a place called yoyo's,

27:00.853 --> 27:02.453
So if we can figure out
what yoyo's is...

27:03.623 --> 27:05.321
- Could be a yo-yo convention?

27:05.358 --> 27:07.190
Watts and I got flyers
at man-stock.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.794
- Okay. Um...

27:10.929 --> 27:13.997
There's also a yoyo's toe
and foot day-spa

27:14.066 --> 27:16.533
That has, wait,
extremely low ratings.

27:16.569 --> 27:18.134
Oh, gosh! Someone caught
hand-foot-and-mouth

27:18.170 --> 27:20.404
Disease there.
- Oh, the coxsackie virus.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.672
Coxsackie virus is no joke.
I mean, the blisters alone...

27:22.708 --> 27:25.275
- Hey, what about yoyo's
exotic lounge on st. Clair west?

27:25.311 --> 27:27.610
Used to be run by bikers.
- Yeah, the strip club.

27:27.647 --> 27:30.147
- Yeah... That's what I heard
when I drove by.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.416
- Well, I think I remember
jake and I

27:33.452 --> 27:35.486
Trying to get in there
with fake ids.

27:35.621 --> 27:37.888
We were like 14, I remember
the bouncer laughed at us.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.423
- Do you think he'd still
hang out there?

27:39.425 --> 27:40.591
- I wouldn't be surprised.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.460
Actually, yeah, no,
that does sound about right.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.362
The jake I know was really
into that kind of stuff,

27:45.431 --> 27:48.132
Big hentai fan, you know,
anime porn.

27:48.267 --> 27:49.966
- I don't know what that is.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.035
- Anyway, I figure that,
strip clubs, all of it.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.837
You know?
- All right, sounds like a lead.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.472
If we're going in there,
we're gonna need backup.

27:55.541 --> 27:57.441
I'm gonna send some uniforms
over there right away.

27:57.576 --> 27:59.776
Naz, sorry my man.
I wish you could come!

28:05.551 --> 28:07.150
(soft music)

28:09.355 --> 28:10.553
(sighs)

28:18.631 --> 28:20.197
(sighs)

28:29.274 --> 28:30.507
(phone chimes)

28:43.155 --> 28:44.955
- Hey! Hey! Guys!

28:45.090 --> 28:46.957
Listen, I messed up.

28:47.026 --> 28:49.893
Yoyo's isn't a strip club,
yoyo is jake mardy's girlfriend,

28:50.028 --> 28:52.429
Yolanda pesci,
I found her on his viewpix.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.230
- No, he's not on social,
we all looked.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.166
- No, it's under a fake name.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.068
It's linked to
an old e-mail address

28:58.203 --> 28:59.503
That he had in seventh grade,

28:59.572 --> 29:01.772
Diahrea85@hotmail.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.373
- Where do we find yoyo?

29:03.409 --> 29:06.009
(sighs)
- she is at 86 marine drive,

29:06.078 --> 29:07.710
Condo 3f.
- All right, come on.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.846
Do you think we'll make it--
- we'll keep you posted.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.388
(tense music)

29:32.605 --> 29:33.871
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey!

29:33.873 --> 29:35.238
Eyes on jake, eyes on jake.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.213
(tires screeching)

29:46.719 --> 29:48.318
Hey, go for jake!
I'll go for the drugs!

29:52.224 --> 29:53.923
(tires screeching)

29:54.727 --> 29:56.125
(engines revving)

30:00.633 --> 30:02.632
(tires screeching)

30:02.634 --> 30:04.734
<i>(sam): Guys, jake's on the move.</i>

30:06.105 --> 30:07.905
<i> (nathan): All right, guys,</i>
<i> we're arriving on the scene.</i>

30:07.907 --> 30:09.373
<i>(sam): Heading to the south end</i>
<i> of the lot.</i>

30:09.375 --> 30:10.506
<i> - Uh... Where's our target?</i>

30:10.543 --> 30:13.176
<i> - Travelling in a red car.</i>
<i> - Red car, got him.</i>

30:13.179 --> 30:14.978
<i> - Good.</i>
<i> - Eyes on jake.</i>

30:15.014 --> 30:16.747
<i> - Trying to cut him off</i>
<i> from the back.</i>

30:16.749 --> 30:18.148
<i> Kelly's on her way too.</i>

30:20.686 --> 30:22.652
- Stop! Stop!

30:26.192 --> 30:27.591
Stop! Gtpd!

30:33.599 --> 30:34.397
- Get up!

30:35.201 --> 30:37.400
Jake mardy, you're under arrest!

30:38.204 --> 30:39.336
(cuffs clicking)
come on.

30:45.110 --> 30:47.377
- So, yolanda, how long
has jake mardy

30:47.379 --> 30:49.312
Been putting his drugs
in your car?

30:49.348 --> 30:51.214
- I told you,
I don't know the guy.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.749
- How did he get your keys?

30:52.751 --> 30:55.685
- I lost my extra key,
maybe he found it.

30:55.721 --> 30:57.087
- Okay, yolanda,

30:57.222 --> 31:00.023
Cut the crap because we have
photos of the two of you

31:00.092 --> 31:01.691
Making out on viewpix.

31:03.328 --> 31:06.296
- Okay, fine, he's my boyfriend.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.032
I still had no idea he was
keeping drugs in my car.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.700
- How long have
you two been dating?

31:11.503 --> 31:13.236
- Six months, but I promise you,

31:13.272 --> 31:14.771
I don't know anything
about this.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.740
- Okay. Uh...

31:17.576 --> 31:18.608
Yolanda...

31:19.778 --> 31:21.411
What did you want
to be when you grew up?

31:22.581 --> 31:23.880
- I don't know. Uh...

31:25.450 --> 31:26.582
A hand model.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.518
- A hand model?

31:29.388 --> 31:30.887
Why not a vet
or a rock star?

31:30.890 --> 31:32.322
Maybe even a ballerina?

31:32.457 --> 31:34.591
- You know what, as a wise man
once said, any dream will do.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.260
The point is it is still
not too late for you

31:36.395 --> 31:37.127
To go after your dreams.

31:38.063 --> 31:40.130
- I think it actually might be.

31:42.268 --> 31:43.734
- Is that a foot?

31:43.736 --> 31:45.702
- Uh... You know what,
let's just put a pin in it,

31:45.704 --> 31:47.537
I mean, what do kids know?
When I was a kid,

31:47.606 --> 31:49.373
I wanted to be a unicorn, so...
- How about now?

31:49.508 --> 31:50.674
What are your goals now?

31:51.477 --> 31:53.743
- Well, I kinda...

31:53.779 --> 31:55.479
Want to become my own girlboss.

31:55.614 --> 31:59.649
My aunt has been selling
hydra-nutriderma products

31:59.685 --> 32:00.984
And she made
all these new friends

32:01.119 --> 32:03.219
And manifested attending
this wicked conference in vegas.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.922
- Okay, so are you really
willing to give up on becoming

32:05.925 --> 32:07.724
A hydra-nutriderma girlboss

32:07.859 --> 32:10.360
To rot in prison for a guy
that you've only known

32:10.495 --> 32:11.495
For six months?

32:12.831 --> 32:14.164
- You know what, if you tell us
about the operation,

32:14.233 --> 32:17.100
Maybe we can manifest
a deal for you.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.704
- Maybe... You're right.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.308
(gasps)
maybe this was meant to happen,

32:25.311 --> 32:26.542
To push me to go for it.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.278
Fine, what do you want to know?

32:29.982 --> 32:31.247
- Who's making the drugs?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.850
- I don't know, but you should
definitely ask krish.

32:33.886 --> 32:35.852
- Why?
- Because...

32:35.854 --> 32:37.287
He's the head of the replicants.

32:38.090 --> 32:38.922
(scoffs)

32:39.057 --> 32:40.256
- Huh.

32:43.528 --> 32:44.995
(crickets chirping)

32:47.265 --> 32:48.598
(tense music)

32:53.973 --> 32:55.572
- Uh... We just came because...

32:55.641 --> 32:58.908
Um, we're trying to strategize
how to approach jake.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.580
We're gonna go, we can go...
Somewhere else.

33:03.715 --> 33:04.848
- I want to do it.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.150
- It's just that...

33:07.186 --> 33:08.952
Gloria wants us to...

33:09.087 --> 33:10.987
Turn him to use him
as an informant.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.255
- Yeah, I know.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.157
I talked to her and it's okay.

33:15.794 --> 33:16.893
- Sure.

33:31.043 --> 33:32.509
- Hey, buddy.

33:36.782 --> 33:37.914
- Nazeer?

33:39.785 --> 33:41.585
Right, yeah, I...

33:41.720 --> 33:43.586
I heard you became a cop.

33:46.225 --> 33:47.791
Wait, did you...

33:48.927 --> 33:50.359
Were you part of all this?

33:51.530 --> 33:53.663
- Not really, no. I, uh...

33:53.665 --> 33:55.999
I backed off when I found out
it was you.

33:57.169 --> 33:58.835
- So, what are you
doing here, then?

33:59.838 --> 34:01.871
- Well, I'm here to offer you
a deal.

34:02.607 --> 34:03.473
- Oh.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.908
How kind of you, yeah, a deal...

34:06.812 --> 34:08.744
From my old pal taai.

34:09.948 --> 34:12.816
The same guy who ghosted me,
what, 20 years ago?

34:14.319 --> 34:16.119
Yeah, I'm thinking no,
thank you.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.054
- Come on, man.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.891
They got you on possession
with intent to distribute.

34:23.362 --> 34:24.428
(sighs)

34:27.966 --> 34:29.432
- The drugs were in
yolanda's car,

34:29.501 --> 34:30.867
How was I in possession of them?

34:31.804 --> 34:33.370
- You can stop all that,

34:33.372 --> 34:35.037
Yolanda told us everything.

34:36.942 --> 34:40.110
We know that you're a replicant.

34:40.979 --> 34:42.912
We know that krish is your boss.

34:44.049 --> 34:47.383
We know that you've been
distributing purple rain

34:47.385 --> 34:49.118
Through an online chat room,

34:50.255 --> 34:52.055
And we know that that system's
been shut down.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.592
What we don't know...

34:55.661 --> 34:57.327
Is how big this thing is,

34:57.462 --> 34:59.796
Or who's making the drugs.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.234
If you cooperate,

35:04.236 --> 35:07.003
I can patch you out
as a confidential informant

35:07.039 --> 35:09.005
And you can help us get krish.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.741
Get the manufacturer,

35:11.743 --> 35:13.543
Bring the whole thing down.
(chuckling)

35:14.680 --> 35:16.279
- Isn't it ironic?

35:16.315 --> 35:18.114
Oh my god, dude.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.351
The original snitch...

35:22.687 --> 35:25.688
...Wants to turn me
into a snitch?

35:25.724 --> 35:27.690
I mean, seriously,
that's messed up.

35:27.759 --> 35:28.758
- How am I a snitch?

35:28.827 --> 35:30.860
- You're the whole reason
I got expelled!

35:32.164 --> 35:34.297
Kicked out of humberside
for selling e.

35:35.901 --> 35:36.933
Come on.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.235
The principal said you told her.

35:40.605 --> 35:43.106
So, I got shit canned.

35:43.108 --> 35:44.740
- I didn't tell them anything.

35:47.579 --> 35:50.413
Jake, look at me, I...

35:50.415 --> 35:52.115
I didn't tell her anything.

35:53.485 --> 35:57.053
If she told you that I did,
it's... Just to get you to talk.

35:57.122 --> 35:58.988
It's one of the oldest
tricks in the book.

36:03.195 --> 36:04.594
(sam): This must be
so hard on naz.

36:06.264 --> 36:08.798
- Naz will be fine.
You know, we got a...

36:08.867 --> 36:12.268
Replicant in custody,
a possible ci

36:12.304 --> 36:14.170
And a trunk full
of purple rain off the street.

36:14.173 --> 36:14.938
- Yeah.

36:16.141 --> 36:17.474
Yeah, I guess.

36:20.145 --> 36:21.211
Just...

36:21.280 --> 36:23.179
(kelly): What if they
stayed friends?

36:24.449 --> 36:27.150
Maybe jake wouldn't be
in this situation.

36:27.986 --> 36:29.352
- Just one misunderstanding.

36:30.622 --> 36:31.755
Just one.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.157
They never speak again.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.294
And then,

36:37.296 --> 36:39.462
It's like their lives
diverge forever.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.772
(♪)

37:18.737 --> 37:21.871
- Yo! Sarah! Hey! Hold up.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.041
- Hey, what's going on?

37:26.044 --> 37:28.344
- Listen, uh...
I'm good for Saturday.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.412
- What?

37:30.215 --> 37:31.748
Oh.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.217
Oh... No, that's...

37:34.286 --> 37:36.152
That's fine, I...

37:36.288 --> 37:38.421
I didn't mean to put
any pressure on you at all.

37:38.457 --> 37:39.822
- I...

37:39.891 --> 37:43.159
I really want to be able
to talk about things, okay?

37:44.229 --> 37:45.495
Because when you don't talk
about things

37:45.630 --> 37:47.430
Is when everything
goes to shit

37:47.466 --> 37:49.699
And I don't want
that to happen, all right?

37:49.735 --> 37:51.568
You want to go do this thing?

37:51.570 --> 37:52.968
I want to know about it,

37:53.005 --> 37:54.904
I want to even try it... Maybe.

37:56.475 --> 37:57.907
I'm not saying that I'm gonna...

37:57.943 --> 37:59.509
Love it or anything,

37:59.511 --> 38:00.777
But you know what I mean?
(chuckling)

38:00.912 --> 38:03.046
I... I want to try.

38:04.182 --> 38:05.315
- Okay.

38:05.317 --> 38:06.615
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.618
- Okay.
(laughing)

38:08.620 --> 38:09.786
Okay.

38:09.921 --> 38:11.387
(sigh of relief)

38:12.924 --> 38:14.657
- To your work win.

38:14.660 --> 38:15.659
- To you.

38:16.395 --> 38:17.594
- Mmm.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.396
- And jen, she's great,
your friend.

38:19.398 --> 38:20.463
Yay, jen!

38:20.465 --> 38:21.931
- It's okay, sam.

38:22.067 --> 38:25.601
Like, I love jen,
but she can be a bit of a bitch.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.269
- You said it.
(chuckling)

38:27.306 --> 38:28.938
- Uh... Yeah, I mean,
that's why all my friends

38:28.940 --> 38:30.206
In high school
were terrified of her

38:30.275 --> 38:33.542
And we always had this weirdly
compartmentalized friendship.

38:33.578 --> 38:35.044
- Well, I think it's...

38:35.113 --> 38:36.879
You know, I think it's okay

38:36.948 --> 38:38.014
To keep things separate,
sometimes.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.083
- Don't worry, I'm not gonna
make you two hang out.

38:40.218 --> 38:42.284
- No, I do mean that,
I think it's good to have space,

38:42.321 --> 38:43.420
You know, be different
versions of ourselves

38:43.422 --> 38:45.488
With different people.
- That's true.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.757
Sometimes with jen, I...

38:47.793 --> 38:49.559
It's like I'm right back
in high school.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.428
- It's weird that you should
mention that.

38:51.563 --> 38:54.564
Uh... One of my coworkers,
another detective,

38:54.699 --> 38:55.965
Was best buds in high school

38:56.101 --> 38:57.900
With our koi-loving drug dealer.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.169
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

39:00.205 --> 39:01.371
20 years later,
they still know

39:01.506 --> 39:02.638
How to get under
each other's skin.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.307
I guess you just can't
shake that type of friendship.

39:04.376 --> 39:05.975
- Well, that's why it's good
to have a friendship

39:06.044 --> 39:07.577
Without baggage for a change.

39:08.647 --> 39:10.679
Cheers.
- Cheers.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.116
Let's down it.
- Mmm.

39:13.251 --> 39:14.316
(chuckling)

39:16.588 --> 39:18.254
(door opens)

39:18.323 --> 39:19.822
(soft music)

39:30.068 --> 39:31.334
- Can I get you anything?

39:31.336 --> 39:33.469
- Um... A beer would be nice,
if you got it.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.673
What you cooking?

39:37.743 --> 39:39.341
- Fish chowder.

39:44.315 --> 39:45.415
- Please.

39:51.356 --> 39:52.721
(bottle opening)

40:05.904 --> 40:08.504
Look, nathan, you're right.

40:10.008 --> 40:11.607
I am petrified.

40:12.778 --> 40:15.044
I've been gone
for eight months and...

40:15.113 --> 40:16.045
(sighs)

40:16.181 --> 40:18.047
You and I have barely

40:18.049 --> 40:19.449
Spent any time together,

40:19.584 --> 40:20.783
And I don't know
what you're thinking,

40:20.786 --> 40:22.985
I don't know how you're feeling.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.854
- I think I've been pretty clear
how I'm feeling.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.993
- Yeah... You're right,
you have.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.128
Then, I got insecure about...

40:34.332 --> 40:35.665
Your ex and...

40:36.935 --> 40:38.668
You know, I was thinking maybe
you thought I wasn't

40:38.737 --> 40:40.102
Living up to...

40:41.272 --> 40:44.407
Whatever you thought
I should be, I don't know.

40:47.479 --> 40:48.944
Maybe that I was super annoying

40:48.980 --> 40:51.080
Or... Arrogant

40:51.082 --> 40:53.148
Or so difficult,

40:53.185 --> 40:56.286
Never thinking about anybody
but yourself, kelly marie duff.

40:56.421 --> 40:58.021
- Okay, I don't think
you're difficult,

40:58.023 --> 40:59.555
Except when you're not
talking to me,

40:59.691 --> 41:01.324
But I've never thought,

41:01.393 --> 41:03.159
Said or felt any
of that other stuff.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.427
- Well...

41:04.496 --> 41:07.297
That's what my mother
told me every night of my life.

41:07.299 --> 41:08.898
Well, the nights
when she was there, which...

41:09.033 --> 41:11.100
Was barely ever.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.706
Me and karina,
raising four little kids.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.541
I was a kid
practically myself,

41:18.676 --> 41:19.775
I was like 12.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.512
So, in the end,

41:23.548 --> 41:27.116
I thought that the lone wolf
was the best way to go.

41:28.887 --> 41:30.185
- Kelly.

41:31.523 --> 41:32.722
I'm sorry.

41:37.596 --> 41:38.794
- Nathan.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.198
I love you.

41:43.268 --> 41:44.667
So much.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.470
With every part of me.

41:48.406 --> 41:49.705
And you're a good man.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.609
(kelly sighs)

41:52.611 --> 41:55.144
You're like the best
relationship I've ever been in.

41:57.248 --> 41:58.981
And all I want,

41:59.017 --> 42:00.749
All I want is...

42:02.820 --> 42:04.153
...Just to be with you.

42:05.557 --> 42:07.423
And I want to stop.

42:07.459 --> 42:09.292
I want to stop playing
these games,

42:09.294 --> 42:12.695
I want to stop playing
defence and being so stupid.

42:13.698 --> 42:14.997
- Okay, that's okay.

42:15.967 --> 42:17.132
Let's do that.

42:18.837 --> 42:21.237
Let's stop playing games,
let's stop playing defence.

42:22.974 --> 42:24.507
Let's do this thing.
(sighs)

42:26.311 --> 42:27.910
All in.

42:30.282 --> 42:32.115
- What? Like...

42:32.918 --> 42:34.049
- Yeah, let's get married.

42:35.820 --> 42:36.986
I'm not kidding.

42:41.292 --> 42:43.660
- I don't want
the stupid stuff, okay?

42:43.662 --> 42:46.262
No rings, no parties...

42:46.264 --> 42:49.198
- No stupid stuff, no rings,
no parties.

42:49.801 --> 42:51.134
Just you and me.

42:53.404 --> 42:54.570
- All in.

42:55.473 --> 42:57.006
- I'm trying to grow old
with you.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.775
(soft music)

43:15.026 --> 43:17.427
(♪)

43:17.429 --> 43:19.395
Subtitling: Difuze
