01:43.460 --> 01:44.540
Press X and L2.

01:45.740 --> 01:48.660
Wait for him behind the bush. Behind...

01:48.740 --> 01:50.060
Told you. He killed you.

01:50.140 --> 01:51.300
What do you want?

01:51.380 --> 01:53.500
You shouldn't lean forward like that,
because it'll numb your hand

01:53.580 --> 01:55.340
and then you won't be able
to play any more video games.

01:55.940 --> 01:58.340
I sleep on a wheat pillow. I heat it up
in the microwave before I go to bed.

01:58.420 --> 01:59.420
This allows for better blood flow...

01:59.500 --> 02:01.980
Max, why are you bothering this poor girl?

02:02.060 --> 02:03.140
Sorry, sir.

02:03.220 --> 02:04.660
- Captain.
- Captain.

02:07.900 --> 02:08.900
Dismissed.

02:12.460 --> 02:14.140
Poor guy. You scared him.

02:15.420 --> 02:17.660
You gotta hide behind the bush
or he'll kill you.

02:22.180 --> 02:24.100
Hey, guys. Don't stay up too late.

02:24.180 --> 02:26.420
Louis' famous opening challenge
is tomorrow.

02:31.940 --> 02:35.660
Parker! Parker! Parker!

02:35.740 --> 02:37.260
Parker! Come on, guys!

02:37.340 --> 02:40.740
Go, Parker! You got this!

02:42.060 --> 02:44.460
Parker, you weakling! How you
gonna let this kid beat you like that?

02:45.980 --> 02:48.300
Come on, Alex! You can do it!

02:53.140 --> 02:55.820
Aw, how sweet!

02:56.940 --> 02:58.940
Look, Daniel.

02:59.020 --> 03:01.820
Alex needs his big sister
to tell him a bedtime story.

03:01.900 --> 03:03.780
I still don't know
why your dad accepted him.

03:03.860 --> 03:06.620
- He's too nice. That's his problem.
- Hmm.

03:17.020 --> 03:20.500
- Give me a smile.
- No, no, I'm not in the mood.

03:20.580 --> 03:22.780
Oh, come on.
It's for the official Greenhouse blog.

03:22.860 --> 03:24.740
It'll give the Eagles a chance
to get to know you better.

03:24.820 --> 03:28.100
- No, no.
- Hey, come on. Come on.

03:32.340 --> 03:34.660
Come on, you can do better than that.

03:34.740 --> 03:38.020
All right, show me the muscles, then.
Show them to me. Good.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.300
Hey, you look great. Eye of the tiger.

03:40.380 --> 03:43.180
Fierce, baby.

03:44.260 --> 03:46.020
Good. Show me your abs.

03:46.100 --> 03:49.700
I need to see them.
There we go!

03:49.780 --> 03:52.660
You see? You're a natural!

03:52.740 --> 03:54.700
What do you mean,
you joined the Greenhouse?

03:54.780 --> 03:58.660
- Come on, Mere. Don't do this to me.
- Are you joking?

03:58.740 --> 04:01.540
What could I do?
I couldn't leave Alex here alone.

04:01.620 --> 04:03.420
Okay.

04:03.500 --> 04:07.660
Tell Owen I won't let them brainwash me.
I'll fight them from the inside.

04:12.820 --> 04:13.980
Did you lose something?

04:14.060 --> 04:17.019
Hey, Brooke. Great to see you.
Is my brother here?

04:17.100 --> 04:18.180
What if he is?

04:18.260 --> 04:20.779
- Can I come in?
- No Ravens allowed.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.860
Seriously?

04:22.940 --> 04:24.780
What is this,
the fourth grade or something?

04:24.860 --> 04:25.780
Hmm.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.660
Jeez, what do they put in their food here?

04:32.860 --> 04:34.220
Hi, Hayley.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.340
Oh, having trouble sleeping
on the first night?

04:36.900 --> 04:40.260
- No, I'm fine.
- Good. Good.

04:40.340 --> 04:43.300
I always find I get energized
on the first night of the year.

04:43.380 --> 04:44.500
It'll be okay.

04:45.380 --> 04:47.380
Uh, careful. They're a tough crowd.

04:47.460 --> 04:50.180
What now? Hey, Dad.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.460
Hi, sweetheart. Just checking on you.

04:58.620 --> 05:01.820
Hey, do you have an extra toothbrush?
I didn't know I was going to stay here.

05:01.900 --> 05:04.220
Sure. They have extra supplies
at the main office.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.060
But you'll need more than that
for the rest of the year.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.700
Thanks, but I only need
to get through the month.

05:08.780 --> 05:10.980
Hey, Woods. Check this out.

05:12.220 --> 05:15.140
They're gonna eat him alive.

05:15.220 --> 05:17.580
I can't believe
we lost Tyler for him.

05:17.660 --> 05:19.740
I mean, this guy is an embarrassment
to the Eagles.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.540
Hey,
don't get too attached to him.

05:21.620 --> 05:22.860
What do you mean?

05:22.940 --> 05:24.940
I mean, he has a temper.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.540
It'll happen again,
and next time, Louis won't forgive him.

05:27.620 --> 05:30.020
Then we'll throw him
a proper going-away party.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.060
- Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah.
- Feel me? Yeah.

05:32.140 --> 05:33.340
So what's the plan?

05:33.420 --> 05:35.580
Just trust your captain. I got you.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.780
All right. 'Cause he gotta go.

05:37.860 --> 05:39.500
Seriously.

05:41.260 --> 05:44.380
Guys, the opening challenge starts now.
We leave in three.

05:44.460 --> 05:45.780
Come on, Eagles, what's up?

05:45.860 --> 05:47.580
Hey, who's gonna crush the Ravens again?

05:47.660 --> 05:48.940
We are!

05:49.020 --> 05:53.980
Eagles! Eagles!
Eagles! Eagles! Eagles! Eagles!

05:54.060 --> 05:55.580
What's the opening challenge?

05:55.660 --> 05:58.140
The opening challenge is the first
competition between the two houses.

05:58.220 --> 06:00.740
No house wants to lose
the first challenge.

06:00.820 --> 06:03.100
- Because winning is the only option?
- Exactly.

06:03.180 --> 06:06.620
The Eagles beat us last year.
The legacy of our house is at stake.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.980
When we lose, I feel sick.

06:09.060 --> 06:13.620
And when I feel sick, I'm not nice.
Now, you want me to be nice, don't you?

06:13.700 --> 06:14.980
- Yes!
- Yes, Captain!

06:15.060 --> 06:16.700
You know,
you don't have to call him captain.

06:16.780 --> 06:20.260
- Let's go, Ravens!
- Let's go, Ravens!

06:25.060 --> 06:26.060
Hayley!

06:30.700 --> 06:33.420
Oh, so now you do want to talk?

06:34.820 --> 06:38.340
I'm sorry I missed your texts.
I was really busy last night.

06:38.420 --> 06:39.260
I'll say.

06:40.220 --> 06:41.420
You saw it, too?

06:46.620 --> 06:49.540
You don't wanna be seen
talking with the enemy.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.420
Watch your back, okay?

06:59.660 --> 07:01.940
Welcome to the opening challenge.

07:05.020 --> 07:07.740
As you all know,
this is not a regular school.

07:07.820 --> 07:11.740
And our goal here is not to prepare you
for the regular state standard exams.

07:12.420 --> 07:14.780
Other than a two-week vacation
at the end of the year

07:14.860 --> 07:17.300
for you to prepare
for that unimportant test...

07:17.380 --> 07:20.460
...we won't be dealing with that at all.

07:20.540 --> 07:24.220
My only job here
is to feed your curiosity.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.700
Now, the Ravens and Eagles
have been rivals for decades,

07:26.780 --> 07:28.460
and this year is no different.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.300
So today I'm sending you a riddle.

07:31.140 --> 07:35.540
You have to solve that riddle
to find the key to unlock this case,

07:35.620 --> 07:38.180
to be the first team
to ring the gong and win.

07:38.260 --> 07:39.660
So, what's the prize?

07:39.740 --> 07:42.100
Yeah, I wanna know what the Ravens
are missing out on this year.

07:44.020 --> 07:46.180
- Really?
- It's okay. Let him talk.

07:46.260 --> 07:51.260
I'll just say that the winning house will
get a treat to kick off a very sweet year.

07:53.020 --> 07:55.780
The riddle is being sent
to your Louie now.

08:03.140 --> 08:05.900
"Ten from the sea to the sand he walks..."

08:05.980 --> 08:07.260
Uh, ten... But what's ten?

08:07.340 --> 08:09.860
"...to look in the soil,
but not in the box."

08:09.940 --> 08:12.180
- This has gotta mean ten steps.
- Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

08:12.260 --> 08:14.140
That must mean ten steps
from the ocean to the sand.

08:14.220 --> 08:15.180
It's hidden at the beach.

08:15.260 --> 08:16.980
- Yeah. Sure. Let's do it.
- Let's go!

08:17.060 --> 08:19.700
Eagles! Eagles! Eagles!

08:19.780 --> 08:22.780
Ravens! Ravens! Ravens!

08:35.380 --> 08:36.820
Well, don't work too hard.

08:38.260 --> 08:40.419
I'm waiting for the real classes to start.

08:50.700 --> 08:53.860
- Babe, are you okay?
- Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

08:54.460 --> 08:55.300
Whoo!

08:59.100 --> 09:01.620
Come on, Eagles, let's go! Dig faster!

09:01.700 --> 09:04.420
I mean, he's here for two days
and already giving us orders?

09:08.820 --> 09:11.420
Hey, don't pay attention to them.

09:14.540 --> 09:16.780
Looking for more humiliating stuff
on your blog?

09:17.580 --> 09:20.180
Oh, go cry to your sister.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.140
Hey, there!

09:38.220 --> 09:41.340
I'm not doing this for the Ravens.
I'm doing this for Alex.

09:41.420 --> 09:43.180
Whatever works for you.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.900
- What are you up to now?
- Something is off. Look.

10:03.900 --> 10:04.980
It's a trick question.

10:05.060 --> 10:07.940
"The key is in the soil,
but not inside the box."

10:08.660 --> 10:10.660
What does a box have to do with anything?

10:10.740 --> 10:12.740
And why is it not in the box?

10:15.100 --> 10:17.100
Maybe it's outside the box.

10:19.020 --> 10:22.540
Yeah. Like, "Think outside the box."

10:23.340 --> 10:25.700
Come on. I think I solved it.

10:33.540 --> 10:37.140
Eric, hey, aren't you gonna
dust for prints?

10:37.780 --> 10:40.260
There are no signs of burglary.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.140
Maybe you just had
a bad dream or something.

10:42.220 --> 10:45.220
Eric, I'm telling you
someone was here last night.

10:45.900 --> 10:48.980
Hey, buddy, I hate to be the one
to have to tell you this, but...

10:49.780 --> 10:52.420
- this has to stop.
- I didn't call you here to lecture me.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.780
I'm not trying to.

10:53.860 --> 10:55.660
I mean, come on, man.
You know I love you.

10:55.740 --> 10:57.820
This whole thing
has already cost you too much.

10:57.900 --> 11:00.260
This thing is my wife.

11:06.060 --> 11:09.500
We all loved Ryan, but look at this mess.
Look at yourself.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.940
- You haven't changed clothes in days.
- You should leave!

11:14.700 --> 11:15.820
Fine.

11:19.860 --> 11:21.940
You know, eventually,
everybody will leave.

11:22.020 --> 11:23.820
I mean, even your kids
didn't want to stay here.

11:25.660 --> 11:29.900
You already lost your wife and your job.
Don't lose your kids, too.

11:31.660 --> 11:32.780
You should leave.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.100
So the riddle said,
"Ten from the sea."

11:43.180 --> 11:45.500
But I don't think he meant the ocean.

11:48.740 --> 11:51.020
Nice move, Woods. Okay.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.580
Um...

11:54.940 --> 11:58.940
One, two, three, four, five,

11:59.020 --> 12:03.580
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

12:06.780 --> 12:08.140
You wanna do the honours?

12:13.180 --> 12:14.700
Honours of what?

12:18.020 --> 12:19.020
I knew you'd find it.

12:21.060 --> 12:23.420
- Here, take it.
- What are you doing, Woods?

12:23.500 --> 12:26.420
Take it. The stupid Eagles
will worship you if you come back with it.

12:31.980 --> 12:33.620
I don't need your handouts.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.620
What?

12:41.180 --> 12:43.740
A wise leader always thinks
outside of the box.

12:43.820 --> 12:45.420
And the Ravens understood that.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.260
So they went to the painting on the wall

12:47.340 --> 12:49.660
instead of looking
in the most obvious place.

12:56.380 --> 12:58.540
- Me?
- You earned it.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.260
I now pronounce the Ravens
winners of the opening challenge.

13:15.340 --> 13:18.780
Ravens! Ravens! Ravens!

13:21.420 --> 13:25.140
First challenge down! Whoo-hoo! All right!

13:25.220 --> 13:27.500
Free food! Yes! We did it.

13:27.580 --> 13:29.740
- Uh, who wants a cupcake?
- I do!

13:29.820 --> 13:32.060
Yeah? Here, here, here.

13:32.140 --> 13:35.860
All right. All right, we got, uh,
pizza over here...

13:36.620 --> 13:38.060
- Who wants a pretzel?
- I do.

13:38.140 --> 13:40.460
Here you go, guys. All right.

13:40.540 --> 13:44.420
- Eagles didn't stand a chance, guys.
- Obviously not. They have no pizza party.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.180
We're the ones with the pizza party.
Want anything?

13:48.180 --> 13:50.860
Oh, man, if I could see the look
on Daniel's face right now.

13:50.940 --> 13:54.260
- Are you kidding me? Oh, man.
- Probably crying.

13:54.340 --> 13:56.140
Oh, yeah, they're probably sitting
in their clubhouse,

13:56.220 --> 13:57.660
- just crying.
- I hope so.

14:00.420 --> 14:03.580
That pizza smelled so good.

14:03.660 --> 14:04.900
- I know, right?
- It's all my fault.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.660
Hey...

14:08.660 --> 14:10.020
you're not the reason we lost.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.540
Look at this.

14:18.340 --> 14:20.300
- Here, take it.
- What are you doing, Woods?

14:20.380 --> 14:22.980
- Take it.
- I don't need your handouts.

14:23.060 --> 14:24.620
You let her win?

14:25.340 --> 14:28.780
Alex is more loyal to his sister
than the Eagles.

14:29.420 --> 14:32.540
She's the one who found the key.
She tried giving it to me.

14:32.620 --> 14:35.340
- Why would she do that?
- 'Cause that's how she is.

14:35.420 --> 14:37.940
She cares more about me
than the stupid competition.

14:38.020 --> 14:39.380
So you admit you could've taken the key?

14:41.140 --> 14:42.700
Yeah.

14:42.780 --> 14:45.940
But that would be cheating.
That's not honourable.

14:46.020 --> 14:49.820
Honour? There's nothing honourable
about betraying your team.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.660
Oh, my God. Who spilled on my backpack?

15:09.740 --> 15:12.100
Who ruined my notebook?

15:12.860 --> 15:15.180
I will kill whoever did this!

15:31.380 --> 15:32.860
He hasn't texted you back?

15:34.900 --> 15:37.300
Maybe you need to give
your brother some space.

15:37.380 --> 15:39.540
He has to learn to take care
of his problems on his own.

15:47.020 --> 15:49.220
So, let me get this straight.

15:49.300 --> 15:53.180
You deleted all those files while
he was right there, sleeping on the sofa?

15:53.260 --> 15:56.380
Don't underestimate me.
I'm a professional.

15:56.460 --> 15:59.740
With the rates you charge,
you better be.

16:00.900 --> 16:01.900
So?

16:03.340 --> 16:05.580
Checked the hard drive. It's all clean.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.580
- Are you sure, Kyle?
- Mmm-hmm.

16:08.660 --> 16:11.460
E-mails, Instagram, chat history,
school papers...

16:11.540 --> 16:14.500
- Everything?
- Judy, relax.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.540
I deleted all the files
that mentioned you.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.300
Here.

16:21.260 --> 16:24.020
A copy of the entire hard drive,
so you can check.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.020
Parker! Parker!

16:41.140 --> 16:42.500
Daniel! Daniel!

16:42.620 --> 16:43.820
Yo, Woods!

16:45.540 --> 16:47.020
Come on, what are you, in the third grade?

16:47.100 --> 16:49.740
Oh, they hate you
in the third grade, too?

16:49.820 --> 16:51.340
All right, bro. Here.

16:53.340 --> 16:55.780
Oh! That hurt?

16:55.860 --> 16:58.620
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

16:58.700 --> 17:02.300
Look, man, you can cry if you want to.
We're all friends here.

17:03.900 --> 17:04.740
Yo!

17:10.260 --> 17:12.380
Hey, stop it. Cut it out!

17:12.460 --> 17:15.180
Stop bothering Alex.
He didn't do anything.

17:15.260 --> 17:19.420
Aw, everyone,
Alex's big sister is here to save him.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.900
- What are you doing?
- What?

17:25.980 --> 17:28.180
I didn't ask for your help.
Mind your own business.

17:28.260 --> 17:30.540
I don't need a Raven to fight my battles.

17:34.540 --> 17:36.540
Who knew the kid had some backbone?

17:36.620 --> 17:39.820
- I didn't.
- Let's play.

17:45.220 --> 17:46.420
Woods!

17:49.300 --> 17:51.220
That's what I'm talking about, Woods.

18:55.580 --> 18:57.940
Yo, seriously.

18:58.020 --> 18:59.940
I had no idea you were that fast.

19:00.020 --> 19:04.020
Right. Yo, man, you got game, kid.
He's gonna help us kill Whitney.

19:05.260 --> 19:07.860
You might actually be able to keep up.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.460
What are you doing here?

19:12.420 --> 19:14.100
Now is that the way to greet your mom?

19:14.180 --> 19:19.020
- What's up, Ma?
- Hey, baby. Mmm.

19:20.380 --> 19:23.620
Ah! Your face is so thin.
Do they feed you here?

19:23.700 --> 19:26.620
They're starving us.
They even make us shower in cold water.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.700
Okay, make fun of your mother.

19:28.780 --> 19:31.100
Is that what you also do?
Just make fun of your mothers?

19:31.180 --> 19:34.540
Actually, yeah, but unlike you,
they don't get the jokes.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.340
Chamomile with honey, right?

19:37.420 --> 19:39.900
- Aw, thank you, sweetie.
- Yeah.

19:39.980 --> 19:42.220
You are just getting prettier every day.

19:43.740 --> 19:45.700
- What's up, babe?
- Hey.

19:45.780 --> 19:47.380
Now, you, I... I don't know you.

19:47.460 --> 19:50.900
- What's your name?
- Uh, Alex Woods.

19:50.980 --> 19:52.340
Huh.

19:52.420 --> 19:54.660
Now, you guys be nice to him.

19:54.740 --> 19:57.580
Something tells me
he was born to be an Eagle.

20:02.180 --> 20:04.020
How could you let this happen?

20:04.100 --> 20:06.540
Me? My father accepted them.

20:06.620 --> 20:09.140
Well, are you the dean of the school
or Louis' puppet?

20:09.220 --> 20:10.460
Do you understand how dangerous it is

20:10.540 --> 20:12.900
for us to have those two kids
running around the Greenhouse?

20:12.980 --> 20:14.500
Don't worry. They won't bother us.

20:14.580 --> 20:18.260
Yeah, they won't bother us, because you
won't let them out of your sight. Ever.

20:18.980 --> 20:20.740
I want you watching over their dreams.

20:21.660 --> 20:22.740
Do you understand?

20:23.980 --> 20:27.340
This mission is too important
to have Ryan Woods' kids ruin it for us.
