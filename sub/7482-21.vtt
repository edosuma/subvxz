WEBVTT

00:05.520 --> 00:06.817
Come on. It's Los Angeles.

00:06.988 --> 00:08.581
Everyone's gotta live
at the beach once.

00:08.890 --> 00:10.153
Not a chance.

00:10.325 --> 00:13.260
You living down here by the beach?
It'll never happen.

00:13.428 --> 00:15.419
It could. I surf.

00:16.865 --> 00:18.629
What? I do.

00:19.067 --> 00:22.196
The fact that you now own
this Becker and seven Merricks

00:22.370 --> 00:23.860
- does not...
- Eight Merricks. Eight.

00:24.038 --> 00:25.062
Eight.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.501
That doesn't make you a surfer.
It makes you a collector.

00:28.810 --> 00:30.278
Yeah, a collector who can surf.

00:30.445 --> 00:32.607
Who tries to surf.

00:32.780 --> 00:33.906
Yo, homey,

00:34.082 --> 00:35.572
let me hold them keys.

00:39.387 --> 00:42.084
Come on, fellas. Let's not do this.

00:42.257 --> 00:44.157
How about that watch, homey?

00:53.535 --> 00:54.593
Yo, step off my crew.

00:55.236 --> 00:57.204
I like your ride. I like your lady.

00:57.372 --> 00:58.703
I'll take them both.

01:03.611 --> 01:05.135
Angelo!

01:06.381 --> 01:07.542
Angelo!

01:08.283 --> 01:09.842
Please.

01:10.518 --> 01:11.883
No.

01:12.053 --> 01:13.111
Please, no!

01:14.689 --> 01:16.020
Oh, God.

01:17.358 --> 01:18.621
Oh, my God.

02:03.738 --> 02:05.706
Don't cut yourself.

02:06.207 --> 02:08.265
Kid's got skills.

02:08.743 --> 02:11.223
I mean, you can't nervously style
that mop without any fingers.

02:11.379 --> 02:13.473
There's nothing to be nervous about

02:13.648 --> 02:15.514
because I have my partner back.

02:15.683 --> 02:18.015
- And it feels good.
- Feels right.

02:18.186 --> 02:19.244
Band's back together.

02:19.420 --> 02:20.615
Rock 'n' roll.

02:20.788 --> 02:22.882
- Van Halen.
- Original lineup.

02:23.057 --> 02:25.617
- Diamond Dave era.
- I mean, is there any other?

02:26.394 --> 02:28.522
- "Jump."
- Oh, "Hot For Teacher."

02:28.696 --> 02:29.959
Oh, "Panama."

02:30.131 --> 02:32.099
- What's in the box?
- Mm. That box?

02:33.468 --> 02:35.402
I mean, is there any other box?

02:36.504 --> 02:38.336
Apparently not.

02:39.407 --> 02:40.738
You didn't answer the question.

02:46.447 --> 02:47.642
That was easy.

02:48.116 --> 02:49.242
Like I never left.

02:49.517 --> 02:50.916
Wait. You left?

02:51.286 --> 02:53.050
When? Seriously, you were gone?

02:53.221 --> 02:54.552
Did you go to Afghanistan?

02:55.890 --> 02:57.153
Kid does have skills.

02:57.892 --> 03:01.419
Speaking of skills, what are you, uh...?
What are you up to tonight?

03:03.998 --> 03:05.762
- Tonight...
- Tonight.

03:07.735 --> 03:11.103
I don't know what's planned for tonight,
but you might need to rain check that.

03:11.272 --> 03:12.831
We caught a case.

03:18.513 --> 03:20.538
Whoa. So no coffee?

03:20.715 --> 03:24.208
No, uh, commiserating with our fellow
employees down in the bullpen?

03:24.385 --> 03:25.477
This must be serious.

03:25.653 --> 03:27.781
Sam's on his way in. Let's start.

03:27.955 --> 03:30.117
This morning, Playa del Rey.

03:31.759 --> 03:33.750
And that is why
I don't drive a Porsche.

03:33.928 --> 03:36.528
I can think of 80,000 other reasons
why you don't drive a Porsche.

03:40.001 --> 03:41.127
Perfect teamwork.

03:41.302 --> 03:42.997
Very TMNT.

03:44.539 --> 03:47.167
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Guys, come on.

03:47.508 --> 03:50.307
Callen and Sam
are totes Leonardo and Raphael.

03:50.478 --> 03:52.776
- That's Callen and Sam?
- Nice.

03:52.947 --> 03:54.540
- And did you just say "totes"?
- Totes.

03:54.716 --> 03:56.684
Hang on. Eric, replay this.

03:58.019 --> 03:59.817
Wait, is that my
homeless-man jacket?

03:59.987 --> 04:02.149
Yeah, it is.
And by the way, never again.

04:02.323 --> 04:04.951
- The stench of that coat is...
- The smell's the whole point.

04:05.126 --> 04:07.726
Half the actors in L.A. walk around
dressed like they're homeless.

04:08.429 --> 04:10.397
- This was an abduction.
- Correct.

04:10.565 --> 04:12.124
Sam fired two Sims into Angelo.

04:12.300 --> 04:14.325
Simunitions, paint-filled bullets.

04:14.502 --> 04:19.201
And after Angelo saw the red paint,
he stumbled into Callen and boom.

04:19.374 --> 04:22.366
- And you hit him with a syringe. Nice.
- Mm-hm.

04:22.543 --> 04:23.840
So who's Angelo?

04:24.011 --> 04:25.809
Paul Angelo, NCIS.

04:27.115 --> 04:28.139
He's one of ours.

04:28.416 --> 04:30.817
Agent Angelo was assigned
to a joint task force.

04:30.985 --> 04:32.851
He's been undercover
for 19 months.

04:33.020 --> 04:37.321
His investigation centered
around this guy, Tyler Brunson.

04:37.492 --> 04:39.153
Now, Brunson is a smuggler.

04:39.327 --> 04:41.591
NCIS believes
he's been using Navy ships

04:41.763 --> 04:43.527
to transport contraband
into the U.S.,

04:43.698 --> 04:46.759
specifically through the use
of the USS Watertown.

04:46.934 --> 04:50.165
Now, Angelo's skills allowed him
to get close enough to build a case.

04:50.338 --> 04:53.103
Three weeks ago, his handlers
lost all communication with him.

04:53.274 --> 04:54.605
He's been under for a long time.

04:54.776 --> 04:56.536
When NCIS realized
Angelo may have gone dark,

04:56.677 --> 04:59.578
the odds were either he was dead
or he'd gone native.

04:59.747 --> 05:00.839
He's not dead.

05:01.015 --> 05:03.735
So you and Sam extracted him in
a way that wouldn't damage his cover.

05:03.885 --> 05:04.909
We had to do it fast.

05:05.086 --> 05:06.886
An agent
with Angelo's background goes native,

05:07.054 --> 05:08.454
it's a matter of national security.

05:08.589 --> 05:10.614
And a random carjacking
just popped up

05:10.792 --> 05:12.590
smack-dab in the middle
of the extraction?

05:12.760 --> 05:14.592
Yeah, it was kind of fun.

05:14.762 --> 05:16.196
Yeah.

05:16.464 --> 05:17.932
Who is the blond?

05:18.099 --> 05:19.828
She's Brunson's wife, Olivia.

05:20.001 --> 05:23.198
And she didn't hang out
for the L.A.P.D. to arrive.

05:23.371 --> 05:24.566
So let me get this right.

05:24.739 --> 05:29.643
Angelo is hanging out with the
boss' stone-cold fox wife at 8 a.m.?

05:30.912 --> 05:32.437
According to his last report,

05:32.613 --> 05:35.708
he's become a trusted member
of the family.

05:35.883 --> 05:37.510
Brunson has him protecting Olivia.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.414
Now, manifests
from the USS Watertown

05:39.587 --> 05:41.248
were discovered to be forged.

05:41.422 --> 05:43.703
Brunson took possession
of a 1-ton container from the ship

05:43.858 --> 05:45.758
a week ago, contents unknown.

05:45.927 --> 05:47.759
The ship was sailing from Jakarta.

05:47.929 --> 05:49.328
The container could hold anything

05:49.497 --> 05:52.330
from high-grade explosives
to chemical weapons.

05:53.501 --> 05:55.230
Angelo's secured in the boatshed.

05:55.403 --> 05:56.837
Hey, nice work.

05:57.004 --> 05:58.768
Maybe Angelo flipped,
maybe he didn't.

05:58.940 --> 06:00.499
Sam and I are gonna finish this op.

06:00.675 --> 06:02.755
We're gonna find out exactly what
Brunson smuggled in

06:02.910 --> 06:03.934
and who's buying it.

06:04.212 --> 06:06.146
Hetty and Granger are lead
on Angelo's debrief.

06:06.314 --> 06:07.514
She wants you in the boatshed.

06:07.682 --> 06:09.275
- Oniit.
- Done.

06:10.318 --> 06:14.050
So, uh, reports are saying
Brunson is a rabid dog,

06:14.222 --> 06:16.953
and with his boy Angelo gone,
no one's holding the leash.

06:17.124 --> 06:20.253
He's spooked.
He lost his top enforcer today.

06:20.428 --> 06:22.396
If Brunson's running
chemical weapons,

06:22.563 --> 06:23.843
he may just disappear with them.

06:24.165 --> 06:26.259
Next time we see him,
could be too late.

06:27.034 --> 06:28.593
Lot of variables here.

06:28.769 --> 06:31.500
This op's gonna have to be
more feather, less hammer.

06:35.576 --> 06:36.941
This ain't right.

06:39.981 --> 06:42.507
It's right until we figure out
whose side you're on.

06:42.683 --> 06:44.777
- I work for you.
- Sure about that?

06:45.319 --> 06:46.980
You've been dark
for three weeks now.

06:47.154 --> 06:50.488
Yeah, I haven't hit the dentist
or been to yoga class either.

06:50.892 --> 06:53.293
I've been running deep cover
for 19 months.

06:53.461 --> 06:55.896
Would you tell him
that this isn't right?

06:56.063 --> 06:57.895
Listen carefully, Agent Angelo...

06:58.065 --> 07:00.898
He has a point, Owen.

07:04.605 --> 07:05.970
Okay.

07:10.177 --> 07:12.669
You grow up on my block
in Flint, Michigan,

07:13.247 --> 07:16.012
you were popping cuffs
before you can ride a bike.

07:16.284 --> 07:18.981
It's how we keep our thieving
little hands warm in the winter.

07:19.153 --> 07:21.986
Shims made out of bobby pins,
paper clips.

07:22.557 --> 07:24.924
I got out of Flint years ago,

07:25.226 --> 07:27.354
but I don't know
that I'll ever truly leave.

07:28.329 --> 07:29.558
If you're gonna cuff me...

07:33.100 --> 07:34.534
do it right.

07:35.303 --> 07:37.362
Don't ever let me see that keyhole.

07:48.015 --> 07:49.176
Nice op this morning, huh?

07:49.350 --> 07:51.717
- Went down just like we drew it up.
- Mm-hm.

07:52.353 --> 07:56.347
Sometimes it's better
to set the hammer down.

07:57.091 --> 08:01.756
We incapacitated and abducted a man
in public right off the sidewalk.

08:02.396 --> 08:03.921
G, you jammed a syringe
into the man.

08:04.098 --> 08:05.793
And no one tracked any of it.

08:05.967 --> 08:07.457
Feather.

08:07.768 --> 08:09.862
I shot Angelo with Sims.

08:10.037 --> 08:13.769
I bet when he's looking at his bruises
later, he won't be thinking, "Feather."

08:23.451 --> 08:26.887
Property's huge, 30 acres.

08:27.855 --> 08:29.323
Thanks.

08:31.993 --> 08:33.357
This place is massive.

08:33.527 --> 08:36.224
But Brunson's not dragging
thousand-pound crates of contraband

08:36.397 --> 08:37.592
over marble floors.

08:37.932 --> 08:39.422
Check out that pool house.

08:41.369 --> 08:42.859
Secure.

08:43.037 --> 08:44.300
Guards are staying close to it.

08:44.572 --> 08:47.098
It's a good place to stash
something you don't want found.

08:47.475 --> 08:49.341
Let's go see what we can see.

08:49.510 --> 08:51.774
Low-vis, no contact.

08:52.146 --> 08:53.443
Covert.

08:53.614 --> 08:55.104
Always works for me.

08:57.051 --> 08:58.382
What?

08:58.552 --> 09:01.351
"Covert" is not a word I would use
to describe the Hanna family.

09:01.856 --> 09:04.617
You can't make it out of a Little League
game without choking someone.

09:04.759 --> 09:06.022
The guy had it coming.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.021
Because he heckled
your kid's team?

09:08.195 --> 09:09.315
Heckling's part of the game.

09:09.463 --> 09:10.988
Words have consequences, G.

09:11.165 --> 09:13.429
You can't just say whatever you want
to somebody's kid.

09:13.601 --> 09:15.262
And Michelle did
what she needed to do.

09:15.436 --> 09:17.234
Let's do this.

09:21.442 --> 09:23.376
I never liked Angelo.

09:24.311 --> 09:26.006
But you respect him.

09:26.180 --> 09:29.775
Well, he's a valuable asset I'll tolerate
as long as he's on our side.

09:29.950 --> 09:32.715
- Is he?
- I don't know.

09:32.887 --> 09:34.321
That's the bad news.

09:34.588 --> 09:35.783
What's the good news?

09:35.956 --> 09:39.893
I suspect he doesn't know either.

09:43.698 --> 09:45.063
I'm going back in.

09:45.232 --> 09:46.700
I have a better idea.

09:47.968 --> 09:49.367
You're going back in.

09:49.537 --> 09:51.869
In a manner of speaking.

09:56.077 --> 09:57.203
What's up?

10:01.248 --> 10:02.647
Tell me what you see.

10:04.085 --> 10:05.951
Okay.

10:06.854 --> 10:09.380
No stress in his body language.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.428
No microexpressions on his face.

10:15.029 --> 10:16.519
He owns that room.

10:16.697 --> 10:18.131
Yeah, he's good.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.594
Find out how good.

10:37.050 --> 10:38.381
Partners, huh?

10:38.551 --> 10:40.076
Detective Marty Deeks.

10:40.253 --> 10:41.778
Special Agent Kensi Blye.

10:45.258 --> 10:46.282
So lay it on me.

10:47.527 --> 10:49.757
You got a criminal mastermind
on your hands here?

10:50.063 --> 10:52.691
Or just another
friendly NCIS operative?

10:52.865 --> 10:56.324
You are one of us
until proven otherwise, Agent Angelo.

10:56.502 --> 10:57.765
The file's legit.

10:57.937 --> 11:02.101
Deep-cover ops, one after another,
none less than 12 months.

11:02.275 --> 11:03.299
You got game.

11:05.011 --> 11:06.775
Or just slow.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.842
Been known to take my time.

11:12.018 --> 11:14.112
Why don't you tell us
about Brunson?

11:15.288 --> 11:17.689
You guys got that undercover flavor
going on too.

11:19.759 --> 11:22.456
Game recognizes game,
et cetera, et cetera.

11:23.563 --> 11:25.088
So Hetty passes up

11:25.264 --> 11:27.494
all the interrogators
and the headshrinkers at NCIS

11:27.667 --> 11:29.635
to put the two of you
in here with me?

11:30.003 --> 11:31.471
Have you asked yourself why yet?

11:31.637 --> 11:34.663
Evidently, in contrast to you,
we follow orders.

11:35.308 --> 11:37.606
- Right.
- Look, this is gonna go

11:37.777 --> 11:39.370
however you want it to go. Okay?

11:39.545 --> 11:42.674
Chew the fat, order a pot of coffee,
make it a late one, we don't care.

11:42.849 --> 11:45.648
Because nobody gets out of here
until we know what we wanna know.

11:45.818 --> 11:47.843
I've been on that side
of the table before.

11:48.187 --> 11:50.451
And undercover's not about
kicking your way in.

11:50.790 --> 11:52.485
But the door's gotta open eventually,

11:52.658 --> 11:54.353
so why don't you just
drop that persona?

11:54.527 --> 11:57.827
I mean, Brunson doesn't care
about you and obviously NCIS does.

12:05.438 --> 12:06.872
I grew up on a ranch...

12:09.809 --> 12:14.474
with cowboys and sheepdogs
nipping at the heels of half-ton bulls,

12:15.248 --> 12:18.343
thousands of sunsets
on Grand Teton.

12:19.218 --> 12:20.686
Driggs, Idaho.

12:20.853 --> 12:21.911
Stick to Brunson.

12:22.722 --> 12:25.157
Now, the oldest hand on our ranch,

12:25.324 --> 12:28.259
he taught me everything I needed
to know about deep-cover ops.

12:32.899 --> 12:35.664
He said that everybody's
got three hearts.

12:36.436 --> 12:40.134
The first heart,
that's the one you show to strangers.

12:40.306 --> 12:41.330
The second heart?

12:41.507 --> 12:42.941
Only your family gets to see that.

12:43.109 --> 12:47.671
Your family and the person put
on this Earth to walk by your side.

12:48.414 --> 12:50.178
Your soul mate.

12:51.651 --> 12:54.279
But that third heart is the thing.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.579
Never let anyone see it.

12:57.156 --> 12:58.920
There's too much truth inside.

12:59.092 --> 13:00.719
Too much risk.

13:02.328 --> 13:03.887
She saw yours, didn't she?

13:05.064 --> 13:07.260
Oh, damn, brother.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.930
This is not gonna end well.

13:11.204 --> 13:13.798
Something happened
on the Brunson op, didn't it?

13:15.508 --> 13:16.907
Got personal for you?

13:17.844 --> 13:20.044
You wanna live to see another day,
you make it personal.

13:20.213 --> 13:21.874
This time it got too personal,
didn't it?

13:22.281 --> 13:23.510
For me?

13:23.683 --> 13:25.082
Or for the two of you?

13:25.251 --> 13:26.275
- Okay.
- It's okay.

13:26.452 --> 13:28.511
You didn't show your third heart.

13:30.423 --> 13:31.948
He did.

13:32.959 --> 13:33.983
Heh.

13:34.994 --> 13:36.257
So, what's her name?

13:36.429 --> 13:38.056
Strike one.

13:38.498 --> 13:40.125
What's his name?

13:40.633 --> 13:42.260
Strike two.

13:43.002 --> 13:44.561
Brunson's wife.

13:52.912 --> 13:54.676
That was a home run.

14:38.858 --> 14:39.950
Go.

15:03.316 --> 15:06.251
We got about two minutes
until the guards come back around.

15:06.786 --> 15:07.810
Sam.

15:25.905 --> 15:27.236
He's dead.

15:40.051 --> 15:43.487
Well, the good news is, the condition
of the victim's skin does not

15:43.655 --> 15:45.987
suggest expostire
to chemical or biological weapons.

15:46.157 --> 15:47.249
What are we looking at?

15:47.425 --> 15:48.859
Ever hear of krokodil?

15:49.160 --> 15:51.254
A cheap drug. And it's deadly.

15:51.429 --> 15:54.023
It killed about 30,000 people
in Russia alone last year.

15:54.198 --> 15:55.688
Mix of morphine, codeine,

15:55.867 --> 15:57.665
gasoline and paint thinner.

15:57.835 --> 15:58.859
Highly addictive.

15:59.037 --> 16:01.117
But the guy was tied to a chair.
It wasn't voluntary.

16:01.272 --> 16:03.934
Yeah, and judging by the state
of the wounds, I'm gonna say

16:04.108 --> 16:06.548
that he was given large amounts
of the drug over several days.

16:06.711 --> 16:07.803
If our intel's correct,

16:07.979 --> 16:11.438
and Brunson smuggled in a 1-ton
container on the USS Watertown,

16:11.616 --> 16:14.517
he's sitting on over
6 million dollars worth of krokodil.

16:14.686 --> 16:17.553
And L.A.'s sitting on a powder keg
if that shipment hits the streets.

16:17.722 --> 16:19.882
Now, if we call an assault team
and we hit the mansion,

16:20.024 --> 16:21.788
krokodil might not even
be there anymore.

16:21.959 --> 16:23.723
Next time it pops up,
it'll be on the street.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.090
Which means we can't wait.

16:25.263 --> 16:26.321
Don't like to wait.

16:26.497 --> 16:28.226
We improvise.

16:28.399 --> 16:30.299
Time to shoot from the hip.

16:37.508 --> 16:38.634
That's a nice watch.

16:40.645 --> 16:42.272
You mind?

16:46.284 --> 16:48.878
It's a Rolex Daytona Chronograph.

16:49.387 --> 16:51.378
It's pretty nice.
How much do those go for?

16:51.723 --> 16:54.317
Enough to remind me
which side I'm fighting for.

16:54.859 --> 16:57.590
"Happy birthday. 12-19-70."

16:57.762 --> 17:00.891
That's not the birth date
that's listed on your NCIS file.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.720
Growing up in Kissimmee, Florida,

17:03.868 --> 17:08.101
this raccoon used to
terrorize our house nightly.

17:08.506 --> 17:10.736
Tearing up the trash,
ripping apart our furniture.

17:11.209 --> 17:12.768
My dad trapped him.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.207
Dumped him in Boggy Creek...

17:14.377 --> 17:16.403
- You weren't born in Florida.
- Or Idaho.

17:16.580 --> 17:17.621
It's a good story, though.

17:36.567 --> 17:40.401
Every time I come in from the cold,
I shed layers.

17:40.838 --> 17:42.431
It's my ritual.

17:42.607 --> 17:46.202
I dump all the things
that made me a person, into a bag.

17:46.377 --> 17:47.742
Then I zip it up.

17:47.912 --> 17:49.903
You're too close to this.
You're burned out.

17:50.615 --> 17:53.084
We're all too close to this.

17:54.352 --> 17:57.879
You ever see the way she looks at you
when you fidget with your hair?

17:58.256 --> 18:02.489
You ever see how he gets stronger just
by hearing the sound of your voice?

18:03.394 --> 18:05.988
Wake up. Look around.

18:06.564 --> 18:09.124
Two people living in a world
of their own creation.

18:11.469 --> 18:13.198
Maybe I got a world like that too.

18:13.371 --> 18:15.411
Well, it turns out
you don't know anything about us.

18:15.540 --> 18:16.871
- Deeks...
- What?

18:17.041 --> 18:20.067
- He's baiting me. I'll take that bait.
- Leave it.

18:20.545 --> 18:22.104
Just leave it.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.243
Olivia.

18:25.049 --> 18:26.278
What happened?

18:26.918 --> 18:31.321
12-19-70 is not my birthday.
It's Brunson's.

18:31.489 --> 18:34.083
Olivia gave him the Rolex
when they started pushing weight.

18:34.258 --> 18:36.989
He wore it for about a week,

18:37.161 --> 18:40.096
decided he wanted
the same one in platinum.

18:40.264 --> 18:43.029
And a week later,
the same one in diamonds.

18:43.201 --> 18:45.101
Brunson's got plenty of bling now,
doesn't he?

18:45.903 --> 18:49.032
Yeah, except for the kind
that actually matters.

18:49.473 --> 18:51.840
I wore this thing on my wrist
the whole time

18:52.176 --> 18:53.837
and that fool never even realized it.

18:55.046 --> 18:59.142
Olivia knows I'm NCIS.
I turned her. Done deal.

18:59.317 --> 19:01.149
She'll testify for us against Brunson.

19:01.485 --> 19:03.214
Are you absolutely sure about this?

19:03.521 --> 19:05.114
I made her fall in love with me.

19:05.289 --> 19:08.725
With that kind of modesty,
how could she possibly resist?

19:10.528 --> 19:14.897
You know, they train us
to create cover stories.

19:15.867 --> 19:18.632
To build entire worlds.

19:19.971 --> 19:21.598
But that's wrong.

19:21.772 --> 19:24.503
Don't add, you subtract.

19:24.942 --> 19:26.467
Strip yourself away,

19:27.345 --> 19:29.746
layer by layer

19:31.349 --> 19:33.113
by layer.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.417
And what's left?

19:37.455 --> 19:40.083
We're in such a mad rush
to give ourselves up.

19:40.258 --> 19:41.657
Then it becomes personal.

19:42.193 --> 19:44.389
All you wanna do is make it work.

19:47.198 --> 19:49.189
Do you feel like it's working for you?

19:50.935 --> 19:52.699
We have agents on the ground.

19:52.870 --> 19:55.168
Give us some information
we can use.

19:57.508 --> 20:00.478
Brunson bought 6.5 million
worth of krokodil on consignment.

20:00.645 --> 20:02.841
That means
he's gotta pay it back fast.

20:03.014 --> 20:04.374
I was supposed to broker the sale,

20:04.515 --> 20:07.507
but now that I'm gone,
he's gonna be scared.

20:07.685 --> 20:09.346
He's gonna be desperate.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.750
And you do not want
Brunson desperate.

20:12.056 --> 20:14.923
- I'll pick up Olivia.
- No, you won't.

20:15.393 --> 20:18.021
- And why is that?
- Because I'm the only one she trusts.

20:18.195 --> 20:19.219
She's unstable.

20:19.397 --> 20:21.627
Anyone else tries,
she's gonna tell Brunson everything.

20:21.799 --> 20:24.632
So you seduce her
or you brainwash her?

20:28.773 --> 20:31.242
My dad dumped that raccoon
in Boggy Creek,

20:31.642 --> 20:35.078
and that very next night,
it happened again.

20:35.513 --> 20:39.416
Some creature in the darkness
tearing apart our home.

20:39.984 --> 20:42.146
There were noises this time.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.414
The kind you can't forget.

20:45.122 --> 20:48.217
It happened the next night
and the night after that.

20:48.893 --> 20:52.796
It turns out
there were two raccoons.

20:53.097 --> 20:54.997
My dad had only trapped the male.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.766
What was going on
with that female?

20:58.135 --> 20:59.933
What drove her insane?

21:00.805 --> 21:02.933
Raccoons mate for life.

21:05.409 --> 21:09.346
But that's a myth and you know it.

21:10.648 --> 21:13.242
I would tread lightly if I were you.

21:13.417 --> 21:14.942
With Olivia.

21:16.754 --> 21:18.620
And with each other.

21:30.067 --> 21:32.593
Plenty of interrogators and shrinks
that you could've sent in,

21:32.770 --> 21:35.330
- and you picked us.
- You trying to tell us something?

21:35.506 --> 21:39.136
- Hetty, this isn't a game.
- Which is exactly why

21:39.310 --> 21:43.713
you and Mr. Deeks
were the only ones for this task.

21:43.981 --> 21:46.143
All right.
Link up with Callen and Sam.

21:46.317 --> 21:48.285
They're moving on Brunson now.

21:51.255 --> 21:53.019
Roger that.

21:56.193 --> 21:59.163
I feel like I need to take a shower
after that conversation.

21:59.330 --> 22:00.354
He really got to you.

22:00.531 --> 22:02.331
Of course he did.
The son of a bitch is right.

22:02.466 --> 22:03.490
Right about what?

22:04.135 --> 22:05.796
Come on, you know what.

22:06.837 --> 22:10.034
Whatever happened between him
and Olivia has nothing to do with us.

22:10.207 --> 22:12.608
Right.
He gets too close to her on the job,

22:12.777 --> 22:15.974
things turn personal when they should
stay professional and he gets burned.

22:16.147 --> 22:18.206
He gets burned. We didn't.

22:18.382 --> 22:19.816
Not yet.

22:20.117 --> 22:23.212
You know what it is?
I just kept looking at him, thinking

22:23.387 --> 22:25.651
that could be me
on his side of the table one day.

22:25.823 --> 22:28.554
That's the game he was running.
This is how he wanted you to feel.

22:28.726 --> 22:31.195
I get that.
It doesn't mean it's not true.

22:31.362 --> 22:33.490
And I would never let that happen
to you.

22:34.799 --> 22:36.198
Right.

22:37.068 --> 22:38.263
Only problem being

22:38.436 --> 22:42.031
that you would be the reason
it happened in the first place.

22:50.448 --> 22:52.007
You ready to roll, G?

22:52.483 --> 22:53.746
Good to go.

23:10.201 --> 23:11.321
Come on, baby, you in there?

23:11.469 --> 23:14.097
You're twisted.
I took your man out the game.

23:18.142 --> 23:19.576
I'll tell you what.

23:22.746 --> 23:25.647
Tell your pretty wife
to look me in the eyes.

23:26.584 --> 23:28.848
She knows how I move.

23:41.332 --> 23:42.390
Sam's in.

23:42.566 --> 23:44.246
That surveillance system
is closed circuit.

23:44.401 --> 23:46.495
We cannot tap into the feed
to support you.

23:46.904 --> 23:50.101
But, Callen, Kensi and Deeks
are on their way to your position now.

23:50.274 --> 23:51.400
Copy that.

24:03.988 --> 24:05.717
Pat him down.

24:16.433 --> 24:18.333
I want that back.

24:22.540 --> 24:23.974
Look at you.

24:24.141 --> 24:25.802
A tough guy, huh?

24:26.210 --> 24:28.338
All swole. Heh.

24:28.746 --> 24:31.477
Rolling in here
like you own the joint.

24:32.449 --> 24:34.213
Maybe I do
and you don't even realize it.

24:34.952 --> 24:36.784
Where's Angelo? Is he alive?

24:37.521 --> 24:39.455
Put a leash on your broad, man.

24:39.623 --> 24:41.489
That would be an impossible task.

24:41.659 --> 24:43.684
More importantly, who are you?

24:43.861 --> 24:44.885
Switch.

24:45.062 --> 24:47.531
Interesting. It's a birth name, right?

24:47.798 --> 24:49.960
Let me guess, you popped out,
and your mom said:

24:50.134 --> 24:52.068
"Let me switch this one out," right?

24:52.236 --> 24:54.898
Talking about mothers
leads to people getting killed.

24:55.072 --> 24:58.531
Look, Switchy Switch,
I got three guys right there.

24:58.709 --> 25:00.734
They're ready to slay you
to the ground right now.

25:01.045 --> 25:02.740
And you're fronting on me?

25:03.314 --> 25:04.679
I never front.

25:04.848 --> 25:06.714
Well, then you better start talking.

25:07.952 --> 25:10.922
Your boy Angelo
said he had a buyer for you.

25:11.522 --> 25:13.320
A thousand pounds of krokodil.

25:13.891 --> 25:15.256
Nice story.

25:15.426 --> 25:17.656
The rest of the story is,
I work with the buyer.

25:17.828 --> 25:18.852
I represent him.

25:19.029 --> 25:21.930
- And Angelo?
- He'll be all right. We got him.

25:24.201 --> 25:25.498
Why did you do him like that?

25:26.303 --> 25:28.397
You got all this paper
and no common sense.

25:28.772 --> 25:30.206
Your man Angelo works for Angelo.

25:30.374 --> 25:32.536
He was stealing from you,
and trying to skim us.

25:33.077 --> 25:34.602
We don't condone that.

25:35.112 --> 25:36.273
You're lying.

25:36.580 --> 25:38.070
I'm talking to your man, not you.

25:40.384 --> 25:41.442
I can move the product.

25:41.719 --> 25:42.880
Thousand pounds today.

25:43.053 --> 25:45.522
Except I don't know you.

25:45.689 --> 25:48.852
And it doesn't look like you brought
the cash. So where's the good faith?

25:49.026 --> 25:50.721
Faith?

25:51.595 --> 25:53.620
- I look like a preacher to you?
- Heh.

25:53.797 --> 25:56.061
I deal in cash only and product.

25:56.333 --> 25:58.563
Thousand pounds, 2 mil.

25:58.736 --> 26:01.433
That's worth maybe
6 on the street or more.

26:01.605 --> 26:04.040
Look like we standing on the street?
This is the big leagues.

26:04.208 --> 26:05.767
Okay.

26:05.943 --> 26:09.675
- I will let you have 50,000 of it.
- You'll let me?

26:09.847 --> 26:11.407
You move it around,
see what you can do,

26:11.548 --> 26:14.518
maybe I'll give you a bigger load
to mess with.

26:14.685 --> 26:18.121
But none of that happens
until you bring Angelo to me today.

26:18.422 --> 26:20.982
I don't get out of bed
in the morning for 50 grand.

26:21.158 --> 26:23.752
- Two-fifty, that's it.
- Okay.

26:25.462 --> 26:27.897
We'll go to Marina del Rey.
I'll pick a spot.

26:28.465 --> 26:30.490
But we take my ride.

26:43.545 --> 26:46.014
You know what I do.

26:46.448 --> 26:48.382
You're the puppet master.

26:48.751 --> 26:50.845
You familiar with that type?

26:51.687 --> 26:54.088
Been on stage my whole life.

26:54.556 --> 26:57.526
Friends are valuable.

26:58.060 --> 27:01.553
Sometimes enemies more so.

27:02.698 --> 27:08.569
Which one am I talking to
right now?

27:09.305 --> 27:11.672
Well, there's no choice there.

27:11.974 --> 27:14.466
Either way I'm dancing to your tune.

27:14.843 --> 27:19.076
You've misread me, Agent Angelo.

27:19.448 --> 27:22.543
This is not a puppet master
you see before you.

27:23.319 --> 27:26.584
I'm the one who cuts the strings.

27:40.235 --> 27:41.828
Kensi, set up overwatch.

27:42.004 --> 27:43.904
Plenty of high ground.

27:44.073 --> 27:45.973
Deeks, stay low,
get close to Brunson's guys.

27:46.141 --> 27:47.581
If things go bad, we'll need backup.

27:47.876 --> 27:50.811
How are you gonna pass yourself off
as a buyer without 250 Gs?

27:52.214 --> 27:53.841
Your partner still a slob?

27:54.016 --> 27:57.008
Slob? I'm standing right here.

27:57.186 --> 28:00.451
Ha, ha. Looks like somebody
nuked a Lululemon back here.

28:05.461 --> 28:08.294
Feels like a quarter-mil to me. Mm.

28:08.597 --> 28:11.794
Smells like you two have adopted
each other's hygiene habits.

28:11.967 --> 28:14.834
All right, Sam's good.
Perfect location for the sting.

28:15.004 --> 28:16.403
Plenty of sightlines for Kensi.

28:16.572 --> 28:18.870
Plenty of cover for Deeks.

28:38.260 --> 28:41.161
So where's your man?

28:41.330 --> 28:42.855
Relax.

28:43.832 --> 28:45.300
I don't like you.

28:45.834 --> 28:48.132
- You don't have to.
- I'm gonna tell you a story.

28:48.404 --> 28:53.342
Just this week, one of my guys,
he tries to lift some of my krokodil.

28:54.109 --> 28:57.238
So I made him shoot all of it.

28:58.680 --> 29:02.548
"If you wish to control others,
you must first control yourself."

29:04.253 --> 29:05.743
Miyamoto Musashi.

29:05.921 --> 29:08.788
Who's that? Does he got a restaurant
on La Cienega or something?

29:08.957 --> 29:10.686
Enough.

29:16.965 --> 29:18.524
Hello, Ms. Blye.

29:18.700 --> 29:20.725
Brunson's unstable, Hetty.

29:20.903 --> 29:22.598
If he keeps it up, I'm taking the shot.

29:22.771 --> 29:23.897
Understood.

29:26.775 --> 29:29.540
It's a bitch when things don't go
according to plan.

29:29.812 --> 29:31.143
Do they ever?

29:31.313 --> 29:34.248
It's been a long time
since Brunson's run a deal by himself.

29:34.416 --> 29:37.215
I was the one that pulled security,
gave him peace of mind.

29:37.386 --> 29:40.219
Now, with me not being there,
he's gonna crack.

29:40.389 --> 29:44.383
Kill one of your people
just to prove he's still got it.

29:45.127 --> 29:47.892
I'm a friend, Hetty. I guarantee that.

29:48.063 --> 29:50.862
Well, that remains to be seen.

29:52.568 --> 29:54.866
Petty Officer Bruce Shapiro.

29:55.037 --> 29:56.061
Brunson owns him.

29:56.238 --> 29:58.764
He is the inside man
on the USS Watertown.

29:58.941 --> 30:01.239
He is the reason krokodil is in L.A.

30:03.178 --> 30:07.581
You can't earn my friendship
so simply, Mr. Angelo.

30:07.749 --> 30:09.444
Keep talking.

30:10.619 --> 30:13.919
The only person that Brunson
will listen to, besides me,

30:14.089 --> 30:16.285
is his wife, Olivia.

30:16.892 --> 30:20.226
Now, I can deliver her right now
from where we're sitting.

30:20.729 --> 30:22.322
Do tell.

30:22.498 --> 30:24.466
- Flint, Michigan.
- Oh.

30:24.733 --> 30:28.931
Popping handcuffs with bobby pins
and paper clips.

30:29.571 --> 30:32.131
Listen, I knew it can end this way.

30:32.708 --> 30:36.269
Olivia out there,
me locked up somewhere or dead.

30:36.645 --> 30:38.704
I promised her
I wouldn't leave her out in the cold.

30:38.881 --> 30:42.613
Alone with Brunson. Now, maybe it
wouldn't be me that came for her,

30:42.784 --> 30:45.344
maybe it would be
someone else from NCIS.

30:45.954 --> 30:49.481
But all she has to hear is one thing:

30:49.825 --> 30:51.190
"Flint, Michigan."

30:51.894 --> 30:54.591
Safe word. You trained her.

30:54.763 --> 30:56.203
Olivia will track it, Brunson won't.

30:56.365 --> 30:59.130
She will know
that your agents are with me.

31:01.770 --> 31:04.137
I promised I'd get her out safely,
Hetty.

31:22.624 --> 31:24.956
I won't forget this.

31:26.862 --> 31:28.421
I know.

31:58.627 --> 31:59.992
This is him?

32:00.162 --> 32:02.062
The buyer to end all buyers, right?

32:02.231 --> 32:04.825
The man who moves the weight?

32:05.400 --> 32:07.528
What is this,
casual Fridays or something?

32:07.703 --> 32:09.569
Bling's just armor for the weak.

32:10.138 --> 32:11.162
I wanted all of it.

32:11.340 --> 32:13.434
A thousand pounds.
This is a waste of my time.

32:13.709 --> 32:15.040
I told you.

32:15.577 --> 32:18.012
Look, I'm sorry
you don't like the situation.

32:18.180 --> 32:19.540
It's just the way it's gonna work.

32:19.681 --> 32:21.046
You don't have Angelo.

32:21.216 --> 32:22.736
Where is he?
That was part of the deal.

32:22.884 --> 32:24.443
Angelo's safe.

32:24.620 --> 32:26.679
This goes according to plan,
he'll be released.

32:27.389 --> 32:29.517
- We good, Switch?
- No, we're not good.

32:29.691 --> 32:32.183
I haven't tested the merch yet.
I haven't even seen it.

32:34.329 --> 32:35.854
I know you, Tyler Brunson.

32:36.031 --> 32:37.226
Oh, do you, now?

32:37.399 --> 32:39.959
You're a regional guy
sitting on too much weight.

32:40.202 --> 32:43.263
- Regional?
- Now, my partner and I are global.

32:43.438 --> 32:45.478
You borrowed the cash,
now you gotta flip the drugs.

32:45.607 --> 32:46.727
You don't have the resources

32:46.875 --> 32:50.140
to move a thousand pounds
of krokodil fast. We do.

32:50.946 --> 32:52.471
This transaction goes fine,

32:52.648 --> 32:54.639
- maybe we can talk about...
- I don't do maybe.

32:55.417 --> 32:59.251
I do the deal on the table only.

33:02.658 --> 33:04.387
I got the cash.

33:04.559 --> 33:05.583
Where are the goods?

33:12.934 --> 33:15.733
I got guys that can move this fast.

33:16.071 --> 33:17.903
A crew out of Flint, Michigan.

33:23.011 --> 33:24.308
Babe, what are you doing?

33:25.681 --> 33:27.979
I told you we could trust Angelo.

33:29.284 --> 33:30.410
Search him.

33:33.055 --> 33:35.319
Hetty, Callen and Sam
have been made.

33:36.825 --> 33:39.089
Safe word, huh?

33:51.639 --> 33:54.006
So you've been calling the shots
all along.

33:55.318 --> 33:57.492
You thought Angelo was your cop.

33:57.711 --> 33:59.145
He's my cop.

34:00.047 --> 34:03.711
You do that, you better kill me.

34:08.389 --> 34:10.357
Let's go. We need to move.

34:15.795 --> 34:17.092
They move or they die.

34:20.067 --> 34:21.364
I have the shot.

34:27.708 --> 34:28.902
Federal agent!

34:36.784 --> 34:38.513
Kensi, you got Olivia?

34:38.686 --> 34:40.016
I don't have a shot.

34:40.187 --> 34:42.087
We're clear. Go.

34:44.757 --> 34:46.089
Federal agent!

34:46.260 --> 34:48.284
Don't do it. Don't do it.

35:10.417 --> 35:12.112
She's out.

35:12.753 --> 35:13.982
Welcome back.

35:22.563 --> 35:24.258
It's over.

35:24.832 --> 35:27.824
After all these years,
you still don't get it, do you?

35:28.535 --> 35:30.299
For guys like me it's never over.

35:30.904 --> 35:33.168
Brunson's dead

35:34.408 --> 35:37.503
and Olivia's in custody.
You'll never see her again.

35:38.045 --> 35:41.640
Yeah, I know you tried to warn her,
but it didn't work out.

35:42.750 --> 35:45.776
You gave everyone a look
inside that third heart of yours.

35:45.953 --> 35:47.853
Turns out it belongs to a traitor.

35:48.455 --> 35:50.975
Well, if you're gonna cuff me,
you better do it right this time.

35:51.659 --> 35:54.822
I'd rather put a bullet in your skull
and dump you in the ocean.

35:57.297 --> 36:00.460
But neither one of us
are getting what we want tonight.

36:09.309 --> 36:10.333
What is this?

36:10.511 --> 36:12.809
I'm not gonna stop you.

36:16.016 --> 36:17.347
What, I'm free to go?

36:17.751 --> 36:20.152
- I walk?
- Yeah, you walk.

36:20.921 --> 36:23.720
But freedom,
that's another matter entirely.

36:58.859 --> 37:00.327
I never thought I'd be famous.

37:02.896 --> 37:04.660
That's how this ends, right?

37:07.835 --> 37:11.294
One moment I'm standing here,
Paul Angelo in the flesh,

37:11.472 --> 37:15.932
the next, I'm just some rumor
the old cats will tell probies in FLETC.

37:17.244 --> 37:20.407
That crazy undercover
who got in too deep,

37:20.748 --> 37:22.944
and Hetty Lange herself

37:23.450 --> 37:25.851
capped him out by the docks.

37:27.254 --> 37:30.019
Your name's not Paul Angelo.

37:30.424 --> 37:32.415
Well, your name is not Hetty Lange.

37:33.927 --> 37:36.521
Your true name

37:37.131 --> 37:40.123
has been wiped from public record.

37:41.068 --> 37:44.595
No traces of your existence remain.

37:44.772 --> 37:49.369
No birth records,
no social security number,

37:49.543 --> 37:52.205
no digital footprint.

37:52.980 --> 37:56.814
Only Paul Angelo remains.

37:57.818 --> 38:01.618
Well, a good puppet
is more useful alive than dead.

38:02.589 --> 38:07.686
We'll see how useful you are
soon enough.

38:09.630 --> 38:11.962
What makes you think
you're gonna see me again?

38:17.137 --> 38:19.629
You owe me your life.

38:20.374 --> 38:24.834
And I always collect on my debts.

38:26.313 --> 38:28.748
Well, maybe that day will come,
maybe it won't.

38:29.483 --> 38:34.250
But if it does, what exactly
are you expecting me to do, Hetty?

38:35.289 --> 38:40.250
Exactly what I tell you to do,
Mr. Angelo.

38:56.810 --> 38:59.074
Now, this one,
running game on Brunson.

38:59.246 --> 39:00.577
Twisting him all up?

39:00.747 --> 39:02.010
That's a feather.

39:02.182 --> 39:05.117
Hold on a second.
We got into a gunfight in the marina.

39:05.385 --> 39:08.787
Just because you put the hammer
down doesn't mean you lost it, G.

39:09.890 --> 39:11.790
Come on, Switch. I'll buy you a beer.

39:12.359 --> 39:14.555
Ha, ha. Switch.

39:25.138 --> 39:27.004
Uh, Deeks.

39:27.174 --> 39:28.471
Hey, yeah.

39:28.642 --> 39:30.736
Tonight. Let's... Wanna talk?

39:30.911 --> 39:34.211
Yeah. Let's start with my gym bag.

39:34.381 --> 39:36.179
- Where is it?
- Evidence locker.

39:36.650 --> 39:39.676
Gym bag was part of the operation,
so it had to go to the evidence locker.

39:39.853 --> 39:42.914
My sports bras are not supposed
to be part of any operation.

39:43.090 --> 39:45.388
This is a gross invasion
of my privacy.

39:45.559 --> 39:48.927
The good news is, this team totally
respects your privacy. So you're fine.

39:49.329 --> 39:52.993
Also, this team thinks it's totally
awesome yet a little bit predictable

39:53.166 --> 39:56.033
that you wear
a Wonder Woman sports bra.

39:56.203 --> 39:58.501
Okay, I wouldn't exactly call them
Wonder Woman...

39:58.672 --> 40:01.192
- No, I saw it. That's what it was.
- You weren't supposed to...

40:01.308 --> 40:03.589
- Match my Superman underwear.
- Didn't need to know that.

40:03.744 --> 40:06.577
- I didn't need to tell you that.
- Okay. Heh.

40:11.852 --> 40:13.786
So about our thing...

40:15.222 --> 40:18.385
Right. About our thing. Um...

40:21.194 --> 40:23.356
Yeah, I don't know
what to do with that.

40:25.432 --> 40:27.526
What does your third heart tell you?

40:52.993 --> 40:54.483
Okay.

41:01.401 --> 41:05.269
Contrary to hundreds of years
of scientific evidence,

41:06.640 --> 41:09.837
I believe that raccoons
do mate for life.

41:49.983 --> 41:51.712
Still sharp.

42:34.828 --> 42:36.227
Touché.

43:02.856 --> 43:05.188
Beginning of the end?

43:06.893 --> 43:09.191
End of the beginning.
