WEBVTT

04:36.577 --> 04:39.245
He's always
out for trouble, that one.

04:43.183 --> 04:45.752
That's for my father.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.733
Shows over.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.859
What's going on here then?

04:50.860 --> 04:52.558
Sir.

04:52.559 --> 04:54.662
Was that young
Armand I saw you fighting with?

04:54.663 --> 04:55.663
Aye sir.

04:57.431 --> 04:58.998
Over what?

04:58.999 --> 05:01.445
Over crazy red, that
painter guy he used to know.

05:01.446 --> 05:03.369
Really?

05:03.370 --> 05:05.213
He dropped that, sir.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.111
I'll take it in.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.455
At ease, soldier.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.758
Causing trouble again I see.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.699
You dropped your letter outside.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.856
It's not my letter.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.691
It's Vincent's.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.031
It's to Theo Van Gogh.

05:27.032 --> 05:29.303
That's Vincent's
brother, isn't it?

05:29.304 --> 05:31.898
Yeah, Vincent left it behind.

05:31.899 --> 05:35.471
His old landlord Geno was
having a clear out and found it.

05:35.472 --> 05:37.745
So he gave it to my
father and father told me

05:37.746 --> 05:39.639
I have to deliver it.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.607
Like it's my business.

05:41.608 --> 05:45.715
My job is to bash metal into
shape not Deliver letters.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.757
Help yourself why don't you?

05:53.758 --> 05:56.598
Well he doesn't
need it, does he?

06:05.299 --> 06:07.438
I don't see the point in
delivering a dead man's letter.

06:07.439 --> 06:11.571
Your father just wants
to pay his respects.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.972
What for?

06:12.973 --> 06:15.808
What did that nobody
ever do for us?

06:15.809 --> 06:19.612
Making my family hated
when my old man refused

06:19.613 --> 06:21.414
to sign that petition.

06:21.415 --> 06:22.621
To throw him out of the town-

06:22.622 --> 06:24.183
- I signed it.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.919
And, that's well and
good, he was mad.

06:26.920 --> 06:27.987
He wasn't.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.356
He was an interesting man.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.859
Things only got strange
when that friend of his

06:32.860 --> 06:33.860
Gauguin cams.

06:39.299 --> 06:42.041
Vincent was all enthusiastic
for his yellow house

06:42.042 --> 06:44.470
to become this
hostel for painters.

06:44.471 --> 06:47.507
And, Gauguin would
be the master.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.112
Where's the chair'?

06:52.946 --> 06:54.016
Yeah, perfect.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.620
But, when he finally came,

06:58.621 --> 07:01.293
they quickly went from
firm friends to being

07:01.294 --> 07:03.055
at each other's throats.

07:33.520 --> 07:37.023
No, no, no you can't Go.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.324
No, you can't got.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.560
Calm down, Vincent.

08:07.621 --> 08:08.427
Beverly.

08:08.428 --> 08:09.423
Hello Vincent.

08:09.424 --> 08:11.223
I brought you a gift.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.126
Have you been fighting?

08:14.127 --> 08:15.361
Take good care of it.

08:15.362 --> 08:16.362
Oh sweet.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.608
Are you alright?

08:28.909 --> 08:31.082
Interesting man?

08:32.879 --> 08:35.313
That's not how I remember him.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.665
That nutcase has
cut off his ear.

08:50.666 --> 08:52.734
Your dad sewing
it back on is he?

08:52.735 --> 08:54.066
No, he's helping.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.512
Well that figures
one drunk and crazy

08:55.513 --> 08:56.513
helping another.

08:57.504 --> 08:58.574
Go on say it!

08:58.575 --> 08:59.607
Say it again.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.424
The trial's next week.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.529
Did not
think there were any left

09:19.530 --> 09:20.932
not after him losing.

09:20.933 --> 09:22.997
Oh they're
back, crawling back in.

09:22.998 --> 09:25.437
Evening
gents, have you seen my son?

09:25.438 --> 09:28.604
Ah Mr. Roulin, yes
you'll find him inside.

09:28.605 --> 09:30.770
He's meant to
be on a train to Paris.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.717
He don't look like
he's planning on going anywhere

09:32.718 --> 09:33.718
right now.

09:34.841 --> 09:35.875
We'll soon see about that.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.176
He's in trouble.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.053
The boy looks for

09:38.054 --> 09:39.812
it.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.157
Evening Joseph.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.659
Why can't You just post it?

09:48.660 --> 09:52.625
I did, the letter
got returned as undeliverable.

09:52.626 --> 09:55.334
Well if your postal
service can't find him,

09:55.335 --> 09:57.363
what makes you think I can?

09:57.364 --> 09:59.965
Just use your initiative son.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.702
An important man like
Mr. Theo Van Gogh

10:02.703 --> 10:04.070
ask around.

10:04.071 --> 10:07.573
But, what do I
say when I find him?

10:07.574 --> 10:11.844
It's customary to start
with I'm sorry for your loss.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.913
Let's got You sobered up.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.861
I can't Go it's too late.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.266
It's a nice night.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.445
You're lo convey
deepest condolences

10:39.446 --> 10:42.381
from myself, your
mother, and your brother.

10:42.382 --> 10:45.611
Oh, and don't forget
Little Marcel.

10:45.612 --> 10:48.114
She was his friend too.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.916
She was 10 months old.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.252
Babes are like animals son.

10:53.253 --> 10:58.023
They can know the heart of a
man just by the size of 'em.

10:58.024 --> 10:59.859
No, they can't.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.795
They're less fickle
than grown-ups.

11:02.796 --> 11:05.030
Just look at Geno.

11:05.031 --> 11:07.739
He takes Vincent's money
with a smile for a whole year

11:07.740 --> 11:10.603
and then signs a
petition condemning him.

11:10.604 --> 11:14.039
Hey, mind you say that
Geno had the letter

11:14.040 --> 11:15.741
for two years.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.551
I don't want Mr. Theo thinking
that we been sitting on it.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.580
Tell him how Geno
didn't even bother

11:19.581 --> 11:21.149
handing it over to
me until he heard

11:21.150 --> 11:22.491
that Vincent had.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.453
Killed himself?

11:27.454 --> 11:30.094
Why do you find that
so hard to believe?

11:30.095 --> 11:31.896
You saw what happened here.

11:31.897 --> 11:32.995
He had a breakdown.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.336
It Happens to people.

11:34.337 --> 11:35.772
If they're weak.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.168
Live longer, you'll see.

11:41.601 --> 11:44.514
Life can even bring
down the strong.

11:47.808 --> 11:52.278
After the ear, nobody would
even give him a chance.

11:52.279 --> 11:55.247
Even kids were tormenting him.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.659
Get out of here!

11:57.984 --> 11:59.156
Go on, get out of here!

12:09.596 --> 12:11.363
We are the kings.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.033
I call it weak
letting kids chase him

12:14.034 --> 12:16.001
into the nuthouse.

12:16.002 --> 12:20.109
And his neighbors, and
the police, and the mayor,

12:21.875 --> 12:23.445
and the whole town!

12:25.445 --> 12:26.947
Against an ill man!

12:30.851 --> 12:33.889
He even checked himself into
Saint Remy to get better

12:33.890 --> 12:34.991
and so he did.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.957
He got discharged cured.

12:37.958 --> 12:41.462
It doesn't mean he
stayed cured, does it?

12:45.198 --> 12:49.635
I feel absolutely calm
and in a normal state.

12:49.636 --> 12:53.709
This is what he writes me
six weeks before he's dead.

12:55.075 --> 12:59.011
How does a man go from
being absolutely calm

12:59.012 --> 13:01.515
to being suicidal in six weeks?

13:04.851 --> 13:06.694
It's sad, I get that.

13:08.521 --> 13:12.560
But, what good will
delivering that letter do now?

13:13.693 --> 13:15.536
They were very close.

13:17.564 --> 13:21.011
Vincent would write
his brother every day.

13:22.235 --> 13:26.405
I know I'm the one who
collected the letters.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.579
If it were me, I'd want it.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.446
If it was you, heavens
forbid, if you had died

13:34.447 --> 13:37.082
and there was a letter out
there that you had sent to me,

13:37.083 --> 13:38.083
I'd want it.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.364
Wouldn't you want
it if it was me?

14:14.287 --> 14:16.267
Whoa, lunatic!

14:57.797 --> 14:59.470
We could go to the Park.

14:59.471 --> 15:02.868
Yeah, but
It's probably still muddy.

15:02.869 --> 15:05.008
I heard you were
Vincent's paint supplier.

15:05.009 --> 15:07.006
So I thought you
might know Theo.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.774
We need a drink I think.

15:08.775 --> 15:09.942
It's brandy.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.176
Do take a seat.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.554
He wasn't at the
address we've got.

15:12.555 --> 15:15.321
The guy there said
you might know.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.820
I'm afraid you'll
never deliver that Letter

15:18.821 --> 15:20.853
to Theo Van Gogh.

15:20.854 --> 15:22.054
Oh, I see.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.159
Well how come?

15:24.991 --> 15:29.064
Two hearts, one mind
that's what Vincent told me.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.034
Maybe that was
the case after all

15:35.035 --> 15:37.903
because after Vincent
died, Theo went

15:37.904 --> 15:39.671
into sharp decline.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.541
Can I get you something my love?

15:42.542 --> 15:44.043
He'd been poorly before,

15:44.044 --> 15:46.820
but Vincent's death
destroyed him.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.931
He had actually been
with him a whole day

15:53.932 --> 15:57.723
at the end, but Vincent
insisted they use the time

15:57.724 --> 15:59.761
to discuss life not death.

16:03.229 --> 16:07.336
And, no suicide note either,
so it stayed a mystery.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.852
And, Theo 'just keep asking why'?

16:18.044 --> 16:22.117
Six months after we buried
Vincent, Theo was dead loo.

16:23.917 --> 16:25.760
Wow, the two of them.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.430
So how did Vincent die?

16:32.592 --> 16:36.962
He shot himself in
the fields above Auvers

16:36.963 --> 16:39.944
by his easel doing what he
loved painting to the end.

16:39.945 --> 16:41.467
Do you know why?

16:41.468 --> 16:42.468
No.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.776
Theo thought his unhappiness
went right back to childhood.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.957
He tried so hard to
fit into his family.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.630
But, he never succeeded in this.

17:12.165 --> 17:16.271
Vincent told me he was the
oldest but Not The first.

17:28.948 --> 17:33.785
There was another Vincent,
a stillborn older brother:.

17:33.786 --> 17:37.256
He thought that boy
was the perfect Vincent

17:37.257 --> 17:41.330
that he could never measure
up to in his mother's eyes.

17:51.671 --> 17:55.448
He struggled to be what
they wanted him to be.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.783
He joined his uncle's
art dealership

18:04.784 --> 18:07.352
and was thrown out in disgrace.

18:07.353 --> 18:09.991
He tried for his father's
profession, the church,

18:09.992 --> 18:12.491
but the pastor exams
were too hard for him,

18:12.492 --> 18:15.727
so he took a job as
a lowly missionary.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.402
He managed to get
sacked even from that.

18:18.403 --> 18:20.499
Yet another dead end.

18:29.542 --> 18:32.182
But, Theo says he
believes in him

18:33.513 --> 18:36.848
and that if Vincent
will fight for himself,

18:36.849 --> 18:39.090
he will fight alongside him.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.230
And, that was it.

18:43.723 --> 18:47.261
Vincent picks up a brush
for the first time at 28,

18:50.930 --> 18:55.037
and with Theo's support,
there is no stopping him.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.583
So what happened then?

19:05.584 --> 19:06.921
Paris happened.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.394
He came here of course.

19:10.395 --> 19:11.450
They all do.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.051
Everyone does.

19:13.052 --> 19:17.422
Monet, Toulouse, Seingnac,
Bernard, Manet, everybody

19:17.423 --> 19:21.793
because everything that
happens in art happens here.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.434
And, where do they
all buy their paints?

19:24.435 --> 19:26.376
Pare Tanguy's of course.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.869
Waitress a drink.

19:30.870 --> 19:31.870
Make it pure.

19:32.939 --> 19:33.917
Cheers.

19:33.918 --> 19:36.575
We'll see if it's pure.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.577
We'll keep that, thank you.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.379
Pure is purer.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.293
We must Be fine,
to the buyer an ego

19:44.717 --> 19:47.085
like no other I grant you.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.421
But, a weekend painter.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.491
Look at him always drawing.

19:52.492 --> 19:55.294
What is it you were
saying on entry?

19:55.295 --> 19:56.137
Which way up is it?

19:56.138 --> 19:57.629
Grow up Henri.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.768
Lei me finish
it in a minute for him.

19:58.769 --> 20:00.676
Oh I forgot You can't.

20:02.135 --> 20:04.436
You're being vile.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.139
The vile doth deny.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.620
For many artists,
Paris is a final destination

20:09.621 --> 20:11.143
but not for him.

20:11.144 --> 20:14.182
It was a stopover to learn
what he needed to learn,

20:14.183 --> 20:17.482
and then he was off in
search of his own path.

20:17.483 --> 20:18.917
You've done it.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.488
It Was in his sleep.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.866
It's the kindest thing.

20:29.962 --> 20:33.131
I saw him once
more after two years.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.373
He was calmer, more assured.

20:36.803 --> 20:37.975
Take good care.

20:39.706 --> 20:44.609
And, I thought this is a man
whose story will end well.

20:44.610 --> 20:48.183
His star finally rising,
his revolution won.

20:53.953 --> 20:57.122
So think how shocking
it was to be standing

20:57.123 --> 21:00.570
over Vincent's coffin
just six weeks later.

21:02.562 --> 21:03.562
So sad.

21:06.833 --> 21:10.369
For many he died
a martyr for art,

21:10.370 --> 21:12.170
but for me, it seems odd.

21:12.171 --> 21:13.472
Why?

21:13.473 --> 21:16.375
In only eight
years, he had traveled

21:16.376 --> 21:20.483
from amateur to an artist
of influence, unbelievable.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.650
Monet declared him
the shining star

21:25.651 --> 21:28.325
of the Independent
Artist's Fair.

21:31.657 --> 21:35.761
And, he was cured
according to his doctor,

21:35.762 --> 21:39.869
Dr. Gachet who had looked
after Vincent in Auvers.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.905
I met him at the funeral.

21:47.373 --> 21:51.014
There were just a few
artists from Paris and him.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.021
I could've thought he
was Vincent's brother.

21:56.022 --> 21:57.892
He was the one who
made the speech,

21:57.893 --> 22:00.552
and he cried all
the way through it.

22:00.553 --> 22:03.295
And, an hour later he was
running around taking Vincent's

22:03.296 --> 22:07.192
best paintings off the
wall as if they were his.

22:07.193 --> 22:10.868
And, they were, his fee,
for treating Vincent.

22:12.765 --> 22:16.804
It seemed odd that the doctor
had Theo's full confidence.

22:19.872 --> 22:23.410
I understand he's still
close to the Van Gogh family.

22:23.411 --> 22:27.646
Maybe you should ask
him why Vincent did it.

22:27.647 --> 22:30.816
It's my father who
wanted to know why.

22:30.817 --> 22:34.492
I just wanted to deliver
this letter for him.

22:35.922 --> 22:39.267
The Van Gogh's are
only ghosts in Paris now.

22:41.594 --> 22:44.329
I'm afraid you're
going to have to take

22:44.330 --> 22:48.437
this letter back to your
father with my condolences.

23:01.514 --> 23:04.324
Dear Father,
looks like I'm continuing

23:04.325 --> 23:06.017
my journey.

23:06.018 --> 23:08.954
I need to find a new recipient
as unfortunately Theo

23:08.955 --> 23:09.955
is dead.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.134
There is this doctor who
I believe is the person

23:14.135 --> 23:16.461
to entrust the letter lo.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.597
So, I'm going to Auvers.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.999
Make some excuse to my boss.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.739
Morning mam.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.040
Yes.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.987
I'm here
to see Dr. Gachel.

24:03.988 --> 24:05.210
Really?

24:05.211 --> 24:06.189
Do you happen to
have an appointment?

24:06.190 --> 24:07.479
No.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.749
I have a letter from
Vincent Van Gogh,

24:10.750 --> 24:12.854
a friend of my
father's from home.

24:12.855 --> 24:13.855
Do you now?

24:15.521 --> 24:18.390
You know he's
actually passed away?

24:18.391 --> 24:19.267
Yes.

24:19.268 --> 24:20.529
The doctor's in Paris.

24:20.530 --> 24:22.506
He won't be back till tomorrow.

24:22.507 --> 24:25.497
I'll make sure the
doctor gets the letter.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.866
I'd rather deliver it in person.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.847
I want to ask the
doctor about Vincent.

24:29.848 --> 24:32.406
Well I can tell you about him.

24:33.940 --> 24:34.940
He was evil.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.943
Is that a medical opinion?

24:37.944 --> 24:41.619
I could tell at first glance
it would end in trouble.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.070
He had these,

24:59.071 --> 24:59.907
Hello?

24:59.908 --> 25:01.099
Hello mam.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.703
Bewildered eyes
in which there was

25:02.704 --> 25:06.206
something insane, something
which you dare not look.

25:06.207 --> 25:10.210
Just straight through at the
back in the garden actually.

25:26.726 --> 25:31.596
Well nothing has been the
same since he came here.

25:31.597 --> 25:33.231
I'll get you a message.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.768
Tell me when it's convenient
for the doctor to see you

25:34.769 --> 25:36.110
where are you in residence?

25:36.111 --> 25:39.104
Where did Vincent reside?

25:39.105 --> 25:40.905
Oh at the Ravoux Inn.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.476
Well you can find me there.

25:42.477 --> 25:44.182
No, you don't
Want to stay there.

25:44.183 --> 25:45.443
It's a hole.

25:45.444 --> 25:48.146
Doctor booked him
somewhere proper.

25:48.147 --> 25:51.149
But, probably suited
him better in a hole.

25:51.150 --> 25:54.919
Well still that's
where you can send word.

25:54.920 --> 25:58.590
You're not gonna stir
things up again are you?

25:58.591 --> 26:00.764
I've had quite enough
weeping over that nutcase

26:00.765 --> 26:02.127
in this household.

26:12.705 --> 26:15.379
(rain pattering}.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.323
You looking for something?

26:32.324 --> 26:33.803
Looking for the owner.

26:33.804 --> 26:35.460
Speaking to her.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.395
You're the owner'?

26:37.396 --> 26:40.502
Well my parents are, but
they're visiting me auntie,

26:40.503 --> 26:44.803
so I guess for the next two
days I'm the proprietress.

26:44.804 --> 26:47.138
That's a fine dress.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.641
Suitable attire
for a proprietress.

26:49.642 --> 26:51.679
I don't get lo
wear it that often

26:51.680 --> 26:53.211
when my father's hers.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.013
Always got errands for ma.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.881
Well that's life.

26:56.882 --> 26:58.183
Fancy something?

26:58.184 --> 27:00.858
I won't say no to a hot coffee.

27:13.532 --> 27:15.834
So what brings you lo Auvers?

27:15.835 --> 27:19.070
A friend of my father's
Vincent Van Gogh.

27:19.071 --> 27:22.507
We just found out
he killed himself.

27:22.508 --> 27:24.175
He stayed here.

27:24.176 --> 27:25.176
I know.

27:27.580 --> 27:30.048
Were you here when it happened?

27:30.049 --> 27:31.722
It was so dreadful.

27:34.754 --> 27:37.555
I sewed the tenants
dinner at seven.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.924
And, he wasn't there.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.598
He came later though.

27:44.697 --> 27:47.132
But, something was very wrong.

27:51.704 --> 27:52.739
Mr. Vincent?

27:52.740 --> 27:54.046
Vincent, are you alright sir?

27:54.047 --> 27:57.043
My father went after him.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.245
Vincent?

28:00.246 --> 28:02.647
What's happened Vincent?

28:02.648 --> 28:03.922
Are you alright?

28:05.151 --> 28:06.151
Oh my God!

28:07.086 --> 28:08.987
What have you done?

28:08.988 --> 28:10.968
I tried to kill myself.

28:15.961 --> 28:19.067
And Dr.
Gachet was called.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.605
He didn't even say
one word to Vincent.

28:22.606 --> 28:24.808
The two of them just
looked at each other

28:24.809 --> 28:26.579
like two angry wolves.

28:30.075 --> 28:31.748
And, Vincent's lying on this bed

28:31.749 --> 28:33.415
and a bulletin his belly.

28:33.416 --> 28:35.752
He's crying out in pain
asking when someone

28:35.753 --> 28:39.127
would remove it, and Dr.
Gachet, an ex military doctor,

28:39.128 --> 28:42.353
I mean he should know
how to remove a bullet.

28:42.354 --> 28:43.988
He does nothing!

28:43.989 --> 28:47.759
He just decided the case
was hopeless and left.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.604
The next morning rumors
about Vincent had spread

28:50.605 --> 28:52.597
all over town.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.635
And, at eight o'clock,
Gendarme Rigaumon

28:54.636 --> 28:55.839
comes knocking.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.204
What are you doing?

28:59.205 --> 29:00.513
Can't you leave
the man in peace?

29:00.514 --> 29:02.211
Can't you see he's not Well?

29:02.212 --> 29:05.519
I'm just being thorough,
Mr. Ravoux, that's all.

29:05.520 --> 29:06.785
Where's the gun?

29:08.013 --> 29:10.048
No idea.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.282
No idea.

29:11.283 --> 29:14.219
My father sent him away.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.063
He said Rigaumon
is the last person

29:16.064 --> 29:18.535
a dying man should have to see.

29:20.326 --> 29:23.301
Mr. Theo came in the
afternoon, and he comes in

29:23.302 --> 29:24.831
yelling, "What happened?

29:24.832 --> 29:26.464
"How?"

29:30.903 --> 29:35.010
That was the terrible thing
is that no one really knew.

29:37.843 --> 29:41.913
And, then, you know,
it was normal and calm.

29:41.914 --> 29:44.082
And, you know I honestly thought.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.217
It was all gonna lo he fine.

29:46.218 --> 29:49.324
If only I could've
been one of them.

29:52.758 --> 29:56.828
But, as the
night came, a fever in him

29:56.829 --> 29:59.497
rose, and he was getting weaker.

30:57.656 --> 31:01.604
And, about half past one,
Theo comes downstairs.

31:07.933 --> 31:10.641
And, we all knew
that is was over,

31:16.675 --> 31:18.348
and Vincent was dead.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.597
What do you think happened?

31:39.598 --> 31:41.432
Did you see it coming?

31:41.433 --> 31:43.468
He was happy here.

31:43.469 --> 31:46.270
I honestly thought He was.

31:46.271 --> 31:50.308
You know Dr. Gachet tried to
gel him to say somewhere else?

31:50.309 --> 31:51.776
But, no.

31:51.777 --> 31:54.045
He liked our place.

31:54.046 --> 31:56.959
No, you're going
to ruin your dress.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.152
Well you're light.

31:59.153 --> 32:00.459
You'll get messy.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.186
Do you want a room?

32:02.187 --> 32:03.063
It depends on the cost?

32:03.064 --> 32:04.322
Come on you.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.624
How much is the room?

32:06.625 --> 32:09.394
It depends on the room.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.295
Another foreigner.

32:11.296 --> 32:14.832
He liked us, and we liked him.

32:14.833 --> 32:17.568
He was a nice, quiet man.

32:17.569 --> 32:18.636
Sure.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.048
What you didn't like him?

32:20.049 --> 32:21.639
It's not that I-

32:21.640 --> 32:22.640
- He could do unusual things
because he was painting,

32:22.641 --> 32:24.848
but otherwise he was normal.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.478
Unusual how?

32:29.048 --> 32:30.550
On his first day, I
remember because it was

32:30.551 --> 32:32.250
a day like today.

32:32.251 --> 32:36.358
This big storm broke, and
everyone's rushing for shelter.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.590
And, I saw him.

32:39.591 --> 32:42.263
He's just standing there
in the rain, in his suit.

32:42.264 --> 32:45.174
And, I thought, you know,
must be first day excitement.

32:45.175 --> 32:47.735
But, no he was always like that.

32:49.368 --> 32:53.441
Always painting day in, day
out no matter what the weather.

32:56.241 --> 32:58.448
I heard he was
close to the doctor.

32:58.449 --> 33:00.678
What Dr. Gachet?

33:00.679 --> 33:02.352
No, I wouldn't have said that.

33:02.353 --> 33:05.049
He kept rather to himself.

33:05.050 --> 33:07.685
He was definitely
close to his brother

33:07.686 --> 33:09.791
judging by the
amount of letters.

33:09.792 --> 33:12.123
I know my dad was his postman.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.228
So you know.

33:14.793 --> 33:17.205
I was wondering when he
slept painting all day,

33:17.206 --> 33:20.798
writing these long
letters, always reading

33:20.799 --> 33:22.073
these fat hooks.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.739
I guess you could say
he was well organized.

33:26.740 --> 33:28.072
Vincent?

33:28.073 --> 33:31.609
Yeah, you could set
your watch by him.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.247
Painting from eight until five.

33:33.248 --> 33:36.158
You'd think he was going
off to a regular job.

33:36.159 --> 33:40.255
He went all over, Chaponval,
the fields, the woods,

33:42.454 --> 33:43.454
the river.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.891
He really liked the river.

33:46.892 --> 33:48.226
Speak to the boatman,

33:48.227 --> 33:49.227
Watch your step.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.730
He'll tell you.

33:50.731 --> 33:51.896
Oh dear.

33:51.897 --> 33:52.967
I'm in.

33:54.466 --> 33:55.636
Enjoy yourselves ladies.

33:55.637 --> 33:57.101
Thank you so much.

33:57.102 --> 33:58.102
Bye.

33:59.505 --> 34:03.141
Armand Roulin friend of
the late Vincent Van Gogh.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.642
Pleasure.

34:04.643 --> 34:07.745
I heard he liked to
hang around the river.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.280
Vincent, yeah.

34:09.281 --> 34:11.581
Yeah, he used to come down here.

34:11.583 --> 34:15.656
Even before dawn to catch
some special kind of light.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.760
Now I don't know much
about light catching,

34:19.761 --> 34:22.329
but I know you can set your
eyes on a lot of life down here

34:22.330 --> 34:24.328
if you catch my drift?

34:24.329 --> 34:25.630
Good lo know.

34:25.630 --> 34:28.199
He didn't talk so much.

34:28.199 --> 34:32.306
Mostly just sat around
watching, sometimes painting.

34:35.440 --> 34:38.009
And, this one time
it was just us,

34:38.010 --> 34:40.277
me fishing, him painting.

34:40.279 --> 34:43.481
Now it wasn't as
peaceful as it sounds.

34:43.482 --> 34:45.826
He made all sorts of
noises while he painted

34:45.827 --> 34:47.851
puffing like a steam engine.

34:51.489 --> 34:54.494
And, then suddenly
it was all silent,

34:56.795 --> 34:59.997
and he looked so happy
that This dirty crow

34:59.998 --> 35:01.341
was coming close.

35:03.035 --> 35:07.672
He didn't seem to care that
it ran off with his lunch.

35:07.673 --> 35:12.176
And, I thought to myself
how lonely is this guy

35:12.177 --> 35:16.023
that even a thieving crow
brightens up his day?

35:23.222 --> 35:25.429
Later that summer, he would
hang around these rich boys

35:25.430 --> 35:28.526
who threw big boating parties.

35:28.527 --> 35:32.597
They always came with girls,
unruly ones if you know

35:32.598 --> 35:33.440
what I mean?

35:33.441 --> 35:34.932
Hey!

35:34.933 --> 35:36.373
Yeah we could
do with a bit of money.

35:36.677 --> 35:38.035
Well is it paid?

35:38.036 --> 35:38.776
Vincent seems shy around them.

35:38.777 --> 35:40.171
Come on.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.709
He never did have
much luck with women.

35:42.710 --> 35:44.242
You think?

35:44.243 --> 35:47.445
And, then he comes here
with the Gachet girl.

35:47.446 --> 35:50.715
I saw her pretty in a
porcelain sort of way.

35:50.716 --> 35:53.287
That's her, a real quiet type.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.291
I've been working
in (his village

35:56.292 --> 35:58.026
since before the
Gachefs moved here,

35:58.027 --> 36:00.560
and I never got to
speak a word with her.

36:00.561 --> 36:04.632
Yet her and Vincent, they
were chatting in that way,

36:06.632 --> 36:08.803
you know, like speaking
to each other was

36:08.804 --> 36:10.143
the most exciting thing ever.

36:11.536 --> 36:13.477
All I could see
was just your foot.

36:13.478 --> 36:15.473
God knows what she saw in him.

36:16.908 --> 36:19.286
Must've been twice her
age, and next to her,

36:19.287 --> 36:21.479
he looked like a tramp.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.915
What, you think there
was something going on?

36:24.916 --> 36:26.793
They said they
were here to paint,

36:26.794 --> 36:29.959
but they took a boat,
couples often do.

36:33.091 --> 36:35.760
But, I will tell you this.

36:35.761 --> 36:39.106
Vincent, he looked
like he was all right.

36:40.299 --> 36:42.767
Then he comes here with
a girl who I reckon

36:42.768 --> 36:44.441
was out of his league,
and the next thing I hear

36:44.442 --> 36:46.006
he's killed himself.

36:47.939 --> 36:50.474
Maybe you should talk to her.

36:50.475 --> 36:53.844
I'm not sure their
housekeeper would let me.

36:53.845 --> 36:54.845
That one.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.450
Spends her afternoons
at the church.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.522
She's some kind of warden there.

37:01.523 --> 37:03.693
She certainly wards me off.

37:09.494 --> 37:11.495
Here you must be thirsty.

37:11.496 --> 37:12.830
On the house.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.298
How nice you are?

37:14.299 --> 37:16.000
Won't your dad mind?

37:16.001 --> 37:17.668
He's not here to mind.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.013
I'll tell you what
I'll have this one

37:20.014 --> 37:22.451
if you let me buy one for you.

37:28.880 --> 37:33.818
I was wondering were Vincent
and Marguerite friends?

37:33.819 --> 37:35.855
The boatman said
they were friendly.

37:35.856 --> 37:37.731
Well that would
explain why she takes

37:37.732 --> 37:39.857
flowers to his grave everyday.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.235
Oh, and it might explain
that big argument

37:41.236 --> 37:43.294
between him and the doctor.

37:43.295 --> 37:44.628
What argument?

37:44.629 --> 37:46.040
More than one person
saw Vincent leave

37:46.041 --> 37:47.904
the doctor's place
slamming the gale so hard

37:47.905 --> 37:50.175
it's a wonder it didn't
come off its hinges.

37:50.176 --> 37:53.170
But, the housekeeper,
she was going round

37:53.171 --> 37:54.672
saying that Dr. Gachel
had stopped Vincent

37:54.673 --> 37:56.874
from seeing his daughter.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.718
Dr. Gachel is crazy
protective over his daughter.

37:58.719 --> 38:01.912
He doesn't want her talking,
where are you going?

38:01.913 --> 38:02.913
To church.

38:14.226 --> 38:15.226
God bless.

38:16.828 --> 38:20.901
Oh glad to see you're honoring
God, not like your friend.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.674
My father's friend.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.347
You know Vincent actually
did his ungodly act

38:30.348 --> 38:31.348
on a Sunday?

38:33.111 --> 38:35.246
That's not the half of it.

38:35.247 --> 38:36.783
I saw him that Day.

38:38.216 --> 38:40.287
I was on my way to church.

38:42.087 --> 38:45.356
Laughing and joking with
those Sacretain boys,

38:45.357 --> 38:48.893
drinking they were
laughing at God,

38:48.894 --> 38:52.930
knowing what he was going
to be doing on God's day.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.873
When I think what he put
the poor doctor through,

38:55.874 --> 38:58.308
marching in with his brother
like they were royally,

38:58.309 --> 39:01.543
like it was his garden,
like they were his guests.

39:01.544 --> 39:04.208
Well his brother might
have been dressed smart,

39:04.209 --> 39:05.711
but it looked like
he'd dropped down dead

39:05.712 --> 39:07.815
before he made it to table.

39:09.381 --> 39:13.295
I could see the fever in
his eyes at first glance.

39:17.088 --> 39:21.161
And, the great artist himself,
always skulking about,

39:24.229 --> 39:28.265
gobbling our food, just
making messes in corners.

39:29.644 --> 39:32.843
Oh well, mustn't keep
our Lord wailing.

40:05.136 --> 40:09.209
I wondered how long it
would take you to come back.

40:18.783 --> 40:20.785
He painted you didn't he?

40:28.460 --> 40:30.030
So why are you here?

40:31.129 --> 40:32.699
Where else would I be?

40:32.700 --> 40:35.041
Oh, I don't know let's see.

40:37.135 --> 40:41.205
Sailing around the
world, catching a thief,

40:41.206 --> 40:42.708
chatting up a pretty girl.

40:42.709 --> 40:46.382
Because I want to do
something for Vincent.

40:50.715 --> 40:52.319
I'm sure there's a
lot you can do for him

40:52.320 --> 40:53.819
now that he's dead.

40:55.353 --> 40:58.261
I heard you take flowers
to his grave everyday.

40:58.262 --> 41:00.429
Isn't that doing
something for Vincent

41:00.430 --> 41:02.192
even though he's dead?

41:02.193 --> 41:03.193
Oh that.

41:04.829 --> 41:07.731
I just do that out of respect.

41:07.732 --> 41:09.767
He was a great artist.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.101
He liked flowers.

41:11.102 --> 41:14.171
Still seems real nice of you.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.243
You must've been friendly.

41:17.609 --> 41:19.610
I wouldn't say so.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.181
He was here to see father.

41:29.020 --> 41:32.256
He was his doctor, and
he became his friend.

41:32.257 --> 41:33.736
It's hardly surprising.

41:33.737 --> 41:35.392
They were both artists.

41:35.393 --> 41:37.394
They liked the same painters.

41:37.395 --> 41:39.534
They understood each other.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.234
When father invited
Vincent's brother

41:42.235 --> 41:44.540
and their family for
Sunday lunch, Vincent joked

41:44.541 --> 41:46.880
about my father was
the third brother.

41:46.881 --> 41:48.282
Cheers everyone.

41:50.609 --> 41:53.783
So you were like
one big family than?

41:56.715 --> 41:58.956
He painted here sometimes.

42:00.418 --> 42:02.762
It was part of the treatment
my father recommended.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.770
But, we didn't socialize.

42:19.771 --> 42:20.841
So when you went to the river,

42:20.842 --> 42:23.173
that wasn't socializing?

42:23.174 --> 42:24.608
The river?

42:24.609 --> 42:26.350
The boatman says you
took a boat together,

42:26.351 --> 42:28.846
said it looked like you
knew each other pretty well.

42:28.847 --> 42:30.520
Well people think they
see all sorts of things

42:30.521 --> 42:31.789
in this village.

42:32.751 --> 42:34.492
Must've been some other girl.

42:34.493 --> 42:36.920
Hold you I barely knew him.

42:36.921 --> 42:39.423
It was father he was here for.

42:39.424 --> 42:40.664
They were like minds.

42:40.665 --> 42:42.593
They agreed on everything.

42:42.594 --> 42:44.164
Everything really?

42:45.430 --> 42:48.932
Ravoux girl said Vincent
and Dr. Gachet argued.

42:48.933 --> 42:51.702
My you really have
been slumming it.

42:51.703 --> 42:53.604
I don't care for village gossip.

42:53.605 --> 42:55.606
She said people saw
Vincent storming out of here

42:55.607 --> 42:58.315
not long before his death,
and your dad was running

42:58.316 --> 42:59.343
after him.

42:59.344 --> 43:00.344
So what?

43:01.680 --> 43:03.819
You think there was some
argument with my father

43:03.820 --> 43:06.550
and that's why Vincent is dead?

43:06.551 --> 43:08.963
You think it's my
father's fault do you?

43:08.964 --> 43:10.487
I didn't say that.

43:10.488 --> 43:14.061
I think it would be
best if you leave now.

43:25.236 --> 43:26.236
Good day.

43:40.151 --> 43:42.152
Thank you.

43:42.153 --> 43:43.061
Busy night?

43:43.062 --> 43:43.896
Not really.

43:43.897 --> 43:45.422
There's your cheese.

43:45.423 --> 43:46.663
And how is your father, Adeline?

43:46.664 --> 43:48.160
He's well, thank you.

43:48.161 --> 43:49.593
Can I get you anything else?

43:49.594 --> 43:50.366
No, I'm fine thank you.

43:50.367 --> 43:51.203
Thank you, no.

43:51.204 --> 43:52.663
Good.

43:52.664 --> 43:54.700
Just busy enough not
to have to speak to me?

43:54.701 --> 43:56.333
Well if I did sit
down for a drink,

43:56.334 --> 43:57.711
I'd be wondering when
you'd be getting up

43:57.712 --> 44:00.876
and running off
somewhere more important.

44:01.940 --> 44:03.442
Funny thing that.

44:06.444 --> 44:08.720
You actually gave me an idea.

44:09.948 --> 44:12.616
The idea to confront
Marguerite Gachet.

44:12.617 --> 44:15.356
Oh so you ran off lo be
with the lady of the manor?

44:15.357 --> 44:16.957
How did that work out for you?

44:16.958 --> 44:19.723
She told me she
didn't know Vincent.

44:19.724 --> 44:23.961
Hadn't barely exchanged a
few formal words with him.

44:23.962 --> 44:28.265
I told you you can't believe
a word the Gachefs say.

44:28.266 --> 44:31.034
I remember when
Vincent moved in.

44:31.035 --> 44:34.573
People were asking him if
he was a relative of Gachet.

44:34.574 --> 44:38.375
Maybe they were
similar on the outside.

44:40.078 --> 44:41.386
This is incredible.

44:41.387 --> 44:43.380
They had the same red hair,

44:43.381 --> 44:45.418
and that same sad
look in his eyes.

44:45.419 --> 44:48.260
I've never seen
anything like it.

44:49.921 --> 44:53.130
But, on the inside,
they were chalk and cheese.

45:18.016 --> 45:20.951
Vincent wasn't
snobbish like Gachet.

45:20.952 --> 45:23.364
He was really polite and kind.

45:24.589 --> 45:26.500
Well hello, Jeuxmaine.

45:31.196 --> 45:32.796
Up you go.

45:32.797 --> 45:35.699
So what shall we draw tonight?

45:35.700 --> 45:36.938
A chicken please.

45:36.939 --> 45:38.175
I might be seeing something.

45:38.176 --> 45:39.512
Okay a chicken.

45:40.471 --> 45:42.272
Skinny legs like you.

45:42.273 --> 45:43.545
Floppy tail please.

45:43.546 --> 45:44.451
Jomaine what are

45:44.452 --> 45:46.710
you doing out of bed?

45:46.711 --> 45:48.612
She's no trouble.

45:48.613 --> 45:50.286
Come on off to bed with you.

45:50.287 --> 45:52.049
She's no trouble.

45:52.050 --> 45:55.054
I want my chicken back.

45:57.322 --> 46:00.224
Marguerite said the
brother came here.

46:00.225 --> 46:02.292
Did you meet him?

46:02.293 --> 46:06.002
No, I heard he came
at Gachefs invitation.

46:07.532 --> 46:10.670
Vincent was always saying
that they might come here.

46:10.671 --> 46:13.649
Always checking if we
had rooms at weekends,

46:13.650 --> 46:15.639
but they never did come.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.811
So did Vincent visit them ever?

46:17.812 --> 46:20.481
No, you know he'd
spend hours on hours

46:20.482 --> 46:22.081
writing those letters
to his brother

46:22.082 --> 46:24.686
when he could've just
hopped on a train.

46:24.687 --> 46:26.750
Oh no, he did go once.

46:26.751 --> 46:30.320
He said his brother's
baby was ill.

46:30.321 --> 46:32.767
But, I don't think the
visit went that well.

46:32.768 --> 46:34.191
. Why not?

46:34.192 --> 46:36.093
The lea towels.

46:36.094 --> 46:38.506
He said that canvasses
were too expensive.

46:38.507 --> 46:39.730
More.

46:39.731 --> 46:40.539
And so now he's only gonna paint

46:40.540 --> 46:41.865
on these old rags.

46:45.603 --> 46:47.207
He painted some pretty
flowers, but I don't think

46:47.208 --> 46:49.773
my father was that pleased.

46:51.743 --> 46:54.417
What has the brother
got to do with lea towels?

46:54.418 --> 46:57.052
I reckon they argued over money

47:02.253 --> 47:05.022
because it was the
brother that bought

47:05.023 --> 47:08.258
all Vincent's painting things.

47:08.259 --> 47:11.962
I know because of the
last letter Vincent sent.

47:11.963 --> 47:13.101
Adeline wait.

47:14.732 --> 47:17.576
The day before
he killed himself.

47:19.604 --> 47:21.809
When he handed it to me,
he said it was urgent.

47:21.810 --> 47:24.478
And, you know I asked if
there was anything wrong.

47:24.479 --> 47:26.545
And, he said he'd run out
of paints and he placed

47:26.546 --> 47:28.956
a big order for some
more 'cause he had lots

47:28.957 --> 47:30.781
of paintings planned.

47:30.782 --> 47:32.886
Don't you think
that's odd to place

47:32.887 --> 47:35.728
an order with his brother
ii money was an issue

47:35.729 --> 47:39.556
between them and then to
kill himself the next day?

47:39.557 --> 47:42.793
It depends, you know,
on how balanced he was.

47:42.794 --> 47:44.728
All seemed fine with him.

47:44.729 --> 47:48.432
I mean something must've
happened pretty suddenly

47:48.433 --> 47:50.734
for him to become unbalanced.

47:50.735 --> 47:52.102
Like what?

47:52.103 --> 47:54.344
I don't know exactly what.

47:55.673 --> 47:59.309
I'm sure it's got something
to do with Gachet.

47:59.310 --> 48:03.080
Do you remember his first
day that I told you about?

48:03.081 --> 48:04.992
This letter's from then.

48:06.684 --> 48:09.024
No, I can't Read
someone else's letter.

48:09.025 --> 48:11.759
If it's open, it's all right.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.690
My dad's
posted me up some money.

48:13.691 --> 48:15.158
I'll open a tab for you,

48:15.159 --> 48:16.365
and you can settle up
when your money arrives.

48:16.366 --> 48:18.466
That's very good of you.

48:24.035 --> 48:25.878
This is where he lived?

48:31.776 --> 48:33.449
And, where he died.

48:49.627 --> 48:52.699
Dear Theo and Jo,

48:56.734 --> 48:59.903
it is really very
beautiful here.

48:59.904 --> 49:02.180
I feel I see the
North all the better

49:02.181 --> 49:04.175
for my trip to the South.

49:05.743 --> 49:08.912
I have settled down
to some canvasses

49:08.913 --> 49:10.914
which I hope will go
some way lo recovering

49:10.915 --> 49:12.553
the pasts of my slay.

49:14.318 --> 49:16.229
Dr. Gachet is eccentric.

49:18.523 --> 49:20.264
I don't Know how he
thinks he can cure me

49:20.265 --> 49:24.061
when he seems at
least as sick as I am.

49:24.062 --> 49:26.235
However, I still
think that what I have

49:26.236 --> 49:30.067
is mostly a malady of the
South, and the the return here

49:30.068 --> 49:34.104
will be enough to
dissipate the whole thing.

49:34.105 --> 49:36.711
The thing is the days seem like,

49:41.612 --> 49:42.886
seem like weeks.

49:46.751 --> 49:49.753
The days seem like weeks to me.

49:49.754 --> 49:52.729
I'll be glad is sometime from
now you were lo come here

49:52.730 --> 49:54.566
one Sunday with your family.

49:54.567 --> 49:58.063
Very hardy handshakes,
your loving Vincent.

51:12.380 --> 51:13.470
What the?

51:13.471 --> 51:14.541
Oy, come here!

52:17.568 --> 52:20.174
Dear
father, I'm still waiting to see

52:20.175 --> 52:21.771
the doctor.

52:21.772 --> 52:23.410
I could've just given the
letter to the housekeeper

52:23.411 --> 52:27.210
or his daughter, but something
happened with Vincent

52:27.211 --> 52:29.112
in that house.

52:29.113 --> 52:30.614
I can tell.

52:30.615 --> 52:33.391
I want to ask the
doctor about it.

52:36.787 --> 52:39.028
I've decided to retrace
the path that Vincent took

52:39.029 --> 52:43.026
with his easel that Day
because what I've been told

52:43.027 --> 52:44.199
doesn't add up.

52:45.396 --> 52:48.275
And, strange things are
happening to me too,

52:48.276 --> 52:52.435
but don't worry, nothing
that I can't handle.

52:52.436 --> 52:55.372
People here are on
edge about Vincent,

52:55.373 --> 52:57.274
about what happened to him.

52:57.275 --> 52:59.943
Everyone has a different story.

52:59.944 --> 53:01.651
Tanguy, the paint
supplier, said that Vincent

53:01.652 --> 53:04.281
shot himself in the
fields, so does the girl

53:04.282 --> 53:05.283
from the inn.

53:06.817 --> 53:09.661
It seems a very long way
for him to have walked

53:09.662 --> 53:13.657
with a mortal would, and
I wonder if he wanted

53:13.658 --> 53:17.494
to kill himself, why didn't
He just pick up the gun

53:17.495 --> 53:19.065
and finish the job?

53:20.965 --> 53:22.774
Did he change his mind?

53:24.268 --> 53:26.680
Did he want to live after all?

53:37.815 --> 53:39.419
No, I can see you.

53:43.988 --> 53:46.356
It was you last
night weren't it?

53:46.357 --> 53:47.461
Oh, not again.

54:15.653 --> 54:17.320
Can I help?

54:17.321 --> 54:18.959
If you could tell me where
to find a funny looking boy

54:18.960 --> 54:22.629
with hair all over the place,
I want to ring his neck.

54:22.630 --> 54:24.694
Oh that'll be my nephew.

54:24.695 --> 54:25.537
I'm sorry.

54:25.538 --> 54:26.666
He's a bit simple.

54:26.667 --> 54:28.541
Please don't pay him any mind.

54:28.542 --> 54:29.899
He's harmless.

54:29.900 --> 54:33.203
He was following me
yesterday and today.

54:33.204 --> 54:35.038
That's not like him.

54:35.039 --> 54:36.676
Did you do something to him?

54:36.677 --> 54:38.551
No, I'm just delivering a letter

54:38.552 --> 54:41.644
for a friend of mine,
Vincent Van Gogh.

54:41.645 --> 54:44.751
The Painter fella, yeah
foreigner, red fellow.

54:44.752 --> 54:46.850
Yeah that's him.

54:46.851 --> 54:49.152
That'll be it then.

54:49.153 --> 54:51.030
That'll be what then?

54:52.890 --> 54:53.891
Here cider'?

54:55.493 --> 54:58.261
Don't mind if I do.

54:58.262 --> 55:00.538
Thatching is thirsty work.

55:06.737 --> 55:10.240
On the day that the
painter fellow was wounded,

55:10.241 --> 55:12.517
we heard a shot
coming from that barn.

55:16.347 --> 55:20.583
And, now my nephew, he
thinks it's haunted.

55:20.584 --> 55:23.753
But, Vincent shot
himself in the fields.

55:23.754 --> 55:26.089
That's what some folks say.

55:26.090 --> 55:30.693
But, I never met a person
who actually saw him there.

55:30.694 --> 55:34.964
The police looked for his
stuff, and they found nothing,

55:34.965 --> 55:39.202
not the gun nor his painting
stuff, nor his paintings.

55:39.203 --> 55:41.149
And, who'd steal
that sort of thing?

55:41.150 --> 55:45.211
So you think he shot
himself here in that barn?

55:47.478 --> 55:49.612
I'm not saying nothing.

55:49.613 --> 55:51.781
We just heard a shot.

55:51.782 --> 55:53.955
Well why didn't
you go in and look?

55:53.956 --> 55:58.655
It could've been anything,
kids shooting rats.

55:58.656 --> 56:00.602
No, it were only the
next day when I heard

56:00.603 --> 56:03.760
that he'd been shot
that I went and looked.

56:03.761 --> 56:05.462
And, there was nothing.

56:05.463 --> 56:08.603
Ii shot himself here, how
come you didn't see his stuff?

56:08.604 --> 56:10.633
That is the question.

56:10.634 --> 56:14.404
It's not that he was in a
state to move it himself,

56:14.405 --> 56:17.106
and why would
anyone else move it?

56:17.107 --> 56:19.178
Oh afternoon Mr. Roulin.

56:22.513 --> 56:27.016
How nice of you to save
me the trip to that place.

56:27.017 --> 56:30.624
Doctor sent me to tell you he
can see you tomorrow morning.

56:30.625 --> 56:32.188
Slop in at any time.

56:32.189 --> 56:34.928
Great, I was just
thinking what you said

56:34.929 --> 56:37.701
about Vincent laughing
around and drinking

56:37.702 --> 56:40.830
with those lads on
the day of his death.

56:40.831 --> 56:41.969
Where was that?

56:43.267 --> 56:47.103
Well it was right
here, exactly here.

56:47.104 --> 56:49.880
Scribbling and scrawling
away he was as always.

56:49.881 --> 56:53.877
So he must've already
had the gun on him then?

56:53.878 --> 56:56.513
Yeah, I guess he must have.

56:56.514 --> 56:59.186
Well he might've had it
amongst his paintings.

56:59.187 --> 57:01.720
Wouldn't want to put
it on display would he?

57:01.721 --> 57:04.025
Where do you think
he got it from?

57:04.026 --> 57:06.900
Ravoux girl said Gachet
was a military man.

57:06.901 --> 57:08.825
Has a gun I guess.

57:08.826 --> 57:11.498
You think he could've
taken it from your place?

57:11.499 --> 57:13.565
- Not unless he
pill: it hack after.

57:13.566 --> 57:15.331
The doctor does have
a gun in his study,

57:15.332 --> 57:16.572
but I dust there
every afternoon.

57:16.573 --> 57:18.701
It's never been elsewhere.

57:18.702 --> 57:22.338
Anyway, everyone knows
it was old Ravoux's gun.

57:22.339 --> 57:25.542
He keeps it under the
counter, little pistol.

57:25.543 --> 57:27.544
And, it's not there anymore.

57:27.545 --> 57:29.388
Well, see you tomorrow.

57:43.093 --> 57:44.834
You were out early.

57:46.263 --> 57:47.263
Long day-

57:48.599 --> 57:49.599
Thirsty work.

57:53.671 --> 57:57.744
And, you've been quenching
that thirst I suppose.

58:00.711 --> 58:03.191
Today I heard mention
of young lads Vincent

58:03.192 --> 58:04.948
would hang around with.

58:04.949 --> 58:06.121
That would be the Sacretains,

58:06.122 --> 58:07.356
but you won't Find them here.

58:07.357 --> 58:09.052
They're in Paris.

58:09.053 --> 58:12.865
They would often joke around
with Vincent especially Rene.

58:17.962 --> 58:20.943
Rene could also take
it a little far.

58:28.439 --> 58:30.640
Poor Vincent, he nearly fainted.

58:30.641 --> 58:34.410
But, then Rene would buy
him a drink to apologize.

58:34.411 --> 58:36.652
He was like that always
picking up the tab,

58:36.653 --> 58:38.923
always buying people drinks.

58:41.952 --> 58:45.321
I was also told that Vincent
got the gun from your place.

58:45.322 --> 58:46.322
What?

58:47.224 --> 58:49.225
Who told you that?

58:49.226 --> 58:50.893
We don't even have a gun.

58:50.894 --> 58:54.464
Gachefs housekeeper
told me you did.

58:54.465 --> 58:55.465
No.

58:56.800 --> 58:59.508
Father used to own one
once, but he didn't reckon

58:59.509 --> 59:02.605
he'd need it here in
Auvers, so he sold it.

59:02.606 --> 59:04.313
Before Vincent was shot?

59:04.314 --> 59:05.642
Yes.

59:05.643 --> 59:07.680
We didn't have it
than, and don't you go

59:07.681 --> 59:10.750
spreading that
squawking hen's gossip.

59:14.785 --> 59:17.020
This came for you.

59:17.021 --> 59:19.797
It says that you've
lost your job.

59:21.325 --> 59:24.494
So you're not Good for credit.

59:24.495 --> 59:27.096
Room for one more at your fire?

59:27.097 --> 59:31.534
You look like
you've had a day of it.

59:31.535 --> 59:35.538
The Ravoux girl deprived
me of my roof for the night.

59:35.539 --> 59:37.485
Here that'll warm you.

59:45.215 --> 59:47.517
Now that's something different.

59:47.518 --> 59:48.792
My own recipe.

59:54.191 --> 59:56.897
So why did the Ravoux
girl get the hump'!

59:56.898 --> 59:59.534
Cause I said that maybe
Vincent got the gun from them.

59:59.535 --> 01:00:02.909
No, no old Ravoux
sold his gun lo Rene.

01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:05.802
Everyone knows that.

01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:08.542
He wanted it for a
stupid cowboy costume.

01:00:08.543 --> 01:00:11.247
He was running around
waving it in people's faces

01:00:11.248 --> 01:00:14.154
pretending he was
in the Wild West.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:20.253
Good customers, but bad sorts
especially the younger one.

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:27.361
Vincent was being gentlemanly
towards the girls,

01:00:27.362 --> 01:00:31.694
and Rene barges in, "Girls,
don't Be bothering with him.

01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:34.163
"He cutoff his dick
as well as his ear."

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:35.164
And, his ear.

01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:39.569
Let's go.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.940
These ones are mine.

01:00:42.906 --> 01:00:44.180
Gaston, come on.

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:50.590
I'd have smacked the
run! If he said that to me.

01:00:50.591 --> 01:00:53.182
So why didn't you then?

01:00:53.183 --> 01:00:55.094
It wasn't my business.

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:58.387
It wasn't my fight.

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:01.224
So why didn't you
make it your fight?

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:02.966
If I said what I
wanted to every lad,

01:01:02.967 --> 01:01:04.735
I'd have no customers.

01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:11.606
Won't you just.

01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:15.144
I could've used that.

01:01:15.145 --> 01:01:17.276
You could've said
something to the boys.

01:01:17.277 --> 01:01:19.310
Couldn't you see they
were bullying him?

01:01:19.311 --> 01:01:22.211
I told you Vincent
was hanging around them.

01:01:22.212 --> 01:01:23.814
If he didn't want to be
there, he could've stood up

01:01:23.815 --> 01:01:24.815
and left.

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:30.586
Maybe he was there because
Rene always picked up the tab.

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:33.293
Or, he just felt lonely and
liked being around young people

01:01:33.294 --> 01:01:34.961
who were enjoying themselves.

01:01:34.962 --> 01:01:36.301
How is it my business?

01:01:36.302 --> 01:01:38.068
No, you've had enough.

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:43.566
Very friendly oi
you, turning your hack

01:01:43.567 --> 01:01:45.134
just like with Vincent.

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:47.240
What did you do for him?

01:01:48.238 --> 01:01:50.940
I don't hear you
telling me that.

01:01:50.941 --> 01:01:53.285
Were you such a great friend?

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:56.651
I never said I was.

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.032
There you go.

01:02:06.033 --> 01:02:07.661
Thank you.

01:02:10.661 --> 01:02:11.861
Hiya.

01:02:11.862 --> 01:02:12.862
Who's he?

01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:16.678
Who's he think he is?

01:02:16.679 --> 01:02:18.668
Probably some bloody gypsy.

01:02:18.669 --> 01:02:20.109
Seem like
a Nancy boy in that jacket.

01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:24.440
Who's he looking at?

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:26.943
Head down, regular circus.

01:02:26.944 --> 01:02:28.144
Look who else is coming in.

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:28.987
Where?

01:02:28.988 --> 01:02:30.479
Behind you.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.315
Let's have some fun then.

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:33.516
Are you coming?

01:02:37.454 --> 01:02:39.522
You are an idiot Sean.

01:02:39.523 --> 01:02:41.833
Who gave birth to that?

01:02:41.834 --> 01:02:44.360
Watch me nanny boy's coming.

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:46.466
What's he want then?

01:02:46.467 --> 01:02:47.964
. Hey Nancy boy.

01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:49.035
Maybe he wants to join me.

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:20.229
My head.

01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:36.389
I didn't do that.

01:03:38.782 --> 01:03:41.786
No, it were me
that landed a punch.

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:45.196
I don't remember.

01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:49.458
I think I was drunk.

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:51.961
Oh you think.

01:03:51.962 --> 01:03:53.629
If I caused any damage-

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:55.437
- You damaged the pride of
a couple of local laughs

01:03:55.438 --> 01:03:56.438
that's all.

01:03:57.968 --> 01:04:00.403
I hear you were
defending the honor

01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:02.077
of our village idiot.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:07.951
Yeah I think they
were picking on him.

01:04:09.379 --> 01:04:11.547
Well they paid their dues.

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:14.383
But, you didn't
need to start on me

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:16.419
when I arrived to
restore the peace.

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.420
I'm sorry.

01:04:20.324 --> 01:04:22.133
You're the lad that was
asking about the Dutch guy

01:04:22.134 --> 01:04:23.759
that shot himself.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.468
Yeah he's a friend of my dad's.

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:31.400
You know my dad's a postmaster.

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:33.938
Strange company
for a respectable man

01:04:33.939 --> 01:04:36.472
like a postmaster to keep.

01:04:36.473 --> 01:04:37.940
Not really.

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:40.315
Vincent generated more
letters than a town,

01:04:40.316 --> 01:04:42.847
so it was sort of a
business relationship.

01:04:42.848 --> 01:04:46.015
So what business
do you have here'!

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:48.017
I have an appointment
with Dr. Gachet

01:04:48.018 --> 01:04:50.586
to talk about Vincent.

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:53.923
I had me eye on him
right from the start.

01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:56.359
Don't worry it'll be all right.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.627
I'll have a little look around.

01:04:58.628 --> 01:05:01.438
So when I come in on
Monday morning to hear

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:04.500
he'd shot himself,
I'm not surprised.

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:05.605
You're here.

01:05:06.703 --> 01:05:08.938
How is Mr. Vincent, any better?

01:05:08.939 --> 01:05:10.778
But, he told me
what I wanted to know.

01:05:10.779 --> 01:05:12.180
It's a bad do,
all this you know.

01:05:12.181 --> 01:05:13.778
That he tried to kill himself

01:05:13.779 --> 01:05:16.121
and not to let anyone
else gel the blame.

01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:20.189
Like I'd blame anyone
else for his crime.

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:25.521
I think we should
leave the man in peace.

01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:28.128
Even caused me trouble
after he were dead.

01:05:28.129 --> 01:05:31.527
Dr. Mazery kept pestering
me to file his report

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:34.797
even though he knew I
already had Gachefs.

01:05:34.798 --> 01:05:36.243
Who's Dr. Maury'?

01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:43.906
Dr. Malay?

01:05:44.808 --> 01:05:45.808
' Yes?

01:05:48.745 --> 01:05:51.480
I would never send
a report normally.

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:53.549
I mean this was Gachefs case.

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:56.318
Then I read that the
patient died two days later

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:57.319
in his room.

01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:01.536
So I felt that I
should for the record.

01:06:02.893 --> 01:06:06.195
I asked the patient
how it happened?

01:06:06.196 --> 01:06:08.230
He said he had shot himself.

01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:10.099
But, I knew he hadn't.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.701
I could tell by his wound.

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:14.403
With suicides, people
shoot themselves

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:15.404
in the head.

01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:20.409
Either in the temple
or through the mouth.

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:24.085
If not, then through the heart,
but not through the stomach.

01:06:24.086 --> 01:06:25.424
I was suspicious.

01:06:26.683 --> 01:06:29.118
The bullet wound,
look, stand up.

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:30.186
Stand up.

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:31.290
Come on, let me show you.

01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:32.728
There you are back and forth.

01:06:32.729 --> 01:06:34.292
That's it, now back like that.

01:06:34.293 --> 01:06:36.125
Now you're down there like that,

01:06:36.126 --> 01:06:37.036
and now look.

01:06:37.037 --> 01:06:38.260
You see there.

01:06:38.261 --> 01:06:40.798
You see that's too low an angle.

01:06:43.266 --> 01:06:44.567
For what?

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:45.568
He would've had to
have fired the gun

01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:47.636
with his outstretched toe.

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:49.477
Go on you outstretch your toe.

01:06:49.478 --> 01:06:50.773
Just stretch your toe out.

01:06:50.774 --> 01:06:51.774
You see.

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:57.453
And, in any case if you fire
a bullet point blank range,

01:06:57.454 --> 01:06:59.552
it'll go through the body.

01:07:00.951 --> 01:07:03.795
Not always, but in
all probability.

01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:08.157
So if it didn't go
through, then the gun

01:07:08.158 --> 01:07:10.229
must've been further back.

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:14.906
Like there, bang!

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:19.401
You see?

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:20.402
I see.

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.848
Most likely he was shot.

01:08:15.392 --> 01:08:18.394
If it isn't the
Provence pugilist.

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:19.962
Should I be scared?

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:22.665
I thought you didn't
go in for village gossip.

01:08:22.666 --> 01:08:23.666
I don't.

01:08:24.568 --> 01:08:26.548
That's why one employs servants.

01:08:26.549 --> 01:08:28.636
They get it for you.

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:30.412
Did you also hear
that your friendly local

01:08:30.413 --> 01:08:33.046
gendarme put me
up for the night?

01:08:34.578 --> 01:08:38.651
So now you're up here
contemplating your future.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:43.886
No actually I was
thinking how come you lied

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:46.689
if you've got nothing to hide?

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:48.897
What makes you
think I have and duty

01:08:48.898 --> 01:08:50.667
to tell you the truth.

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:54.435
Maybe I just thought my life
was none of your business.

01:08:54.435 --> 01:08:56.377
I wasn't asking about your life.

01:08:56.377 --> 01:08:58.867
I was asking about
Vincent's death.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:02.247
You thought that his death
and my life were linked?

01:09:02.247 --> 01:09:05.345
Yes, bull don't
think that anymore.

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:31.374
The truth is I'm not important.

01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:38.107
He wasn't some
lovelorn teenager.

01:09:38.108 --> 01:09:39.108
I know.

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:43.290
Did you know he was a genius?

01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:48.093
No, I can't Say that I did.

01:09:52.055 --> 01:09:53.055
Well I did.

01:10:08.171 --> 01:10:10.673
It's not finished yet.

01:10:10.674 --> 01:10:12.483
Alright, I'll see it later.

01:10:12.484 --> 01:10:14.250
Thank you.

01:10:16.112 --> 01:10:16.988
Finished?

01:10:16.989 --> 01:10:18.847
He's still working.

01:10:18.848 --> 01:10:20.516
And, so did my father.

01:10:20.517 --> 01:10:23.757
All his life he has tried
so hard to be an artist.

01:10:23.758 --> 01:10:27.826
And, then this gruff awkward
man without any proper training

01:10:30.193 --> 01:10:33.101
who'd only been painting a
few years comes barging in

01:10:33.102 --> 01:10:35.770
and rushes off in a couple
of hours what poor father

01:10:35.771 --> 01:10:39.338
couldn't dream of
painting in two lifetimes.

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:44.546
My dad would lock himself
away and copy them for hours.

01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:52.147
Father told me I was
distracting Vincent

01:10:52.148 --> 01:10:53.718
from important work.

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:57.788
Asked if I really
wanted to be responsible

01:10:57.789 --> 01:11:01.360
for preventing masterpieces
from being born?

01:11:02.325 --> 01:11:05.060
And, of course I didn't.

01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:08.338
So I started lo not
be in or not he well

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:11.670
when Vincent called.

01:11:16.506 --> 01:11:19.578
Soon after that,
they had an argument,

01:11:21.211 --> 01:11:22.349
a terrible row.

01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:27.056
It wasn't about me,
but maybe my withdrawal

01:11:30.086 --> 01:11:31.531
had soured things.

01:11:35.592 --> 01:11:37.572
The next time my father saw him,

01:11:37.573 --> 01:11:39.904
he had a bullet in his belly.

01:11:41.564 --> 01:11:43.339
Are you satisfied now?

01:11:44.434 --> 01:11:45.777
You can blame me.

01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:48.108
You can blame my father.

01:11:48.109 --> 01:11:49.879
You're not to blame.

01:11:51.274 --> 01:11:53.049
You've not part in it.

01:11:56.212 --> 01:11:58.214
He was shot by some boys.

01:11:59.516 --> 01:12:01.928
Some boy named Rene Sacretain.

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:04.953
I'm serious.

01:12:06.289 --> 01:12:07.632
I can see that.

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:12.299
Rene': an idiot for sure,
but he's not a murderer.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:15.230
An idiot who
drank, who had a gun,

01:12:15.231 --> 01:12:16.767
who walked around
all summer with it

01:12:16.768 --> 01:12:20.269
waving it in people's
faces, who bullied Vincent,

01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:23.217
who was seen with Vincent
on the day of his death,

01:12:23.218 --> 01:12:25.641
and his stuff disappears.

01:12:25.642 --> 01:12:30.546
He didn't disappear it himself,
so there must have been

01:12:30.547 --> 01:12:32.047
someone else.

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:33.288
It must've been.

01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:36.560
So lonely Vincent
resorts to hanging around

01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:39.932
with drunken teenagers,
and he gets shot.

01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:45.305
Or, he shoots himself in
despair at his lonely life.

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:49.340
The result is the same.

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:53.614
Either way, instead
he could've been

01:12:54.904 --> 01:12:58.807
at our place painting if
I'd behaved differently,

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:00.513
if him and my father
hadn't argued.

01:13:00.514 --> 01:13:02.683
But, don't you care
that some bastard

01:13:02.684 --> 01:13:05.353
may have gotten
away with murder?

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:11.653
You want to know so
much about his death,

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:14.362
but what do you
know of his life?

01:13:15.658 --> 01:13:18.605
I know that he
tried hard to prove

01:13:19.963 --> 01:13:22.034
he was good for something.

01:13:24.367 --> 01:13:25.471
Yes, he did.

01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:33.542
That's why Hake
flowers to his grave.

01:13:33.543 --> 01:13:36.149
That's all I can do for him now.

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:44.353
He would appreciate the
delicate beauty of their bloom

01:13:44.354 --> 01:13:47.460
even each blade of
their grassy stems.

01:13:51.227 --> 01:13:55.334
No detail of life was too
small or too humble for him.

01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:02.504
He appreciated and loved it all.

01:14:30.433 --> 01:14:32.374
Let you out of jail did they?

01:14:32.375 --> 01:14:34.939
On account of my
winning personality.

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:37.214
It's like trying to out
disgrace your friend Vincent.

01:14:37.215 --> 01:14:38.776
I'm working on it.

01:14:45.782 --> 01:14:48.626
You must be the young man
who's been waiting to see me.

01:14:48.627 --> 01:14:50.218
Armand Roulin.

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:52.756
Son of the great Joseph
Roulin, giant of the South

01:14:52.757 --> 01:14:55.057
with Dostoevsky': soul.

01:14:55.058 --> 01:14:56.425
What?

01:14:56.426 --> 01:14:58.231
That's what Vincent
called your father.

01:14:58.232 --> 01:14:59.895
He told me all about him.

01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:00.772
He did?

01:15:00.773 --> 01:15:02.397
Yes, and your mother,

01:15:02.398 --> 01:15:04.969
whose lullaby

01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:08.770
could sooth even the souls
of Icelandic fisherman.

01:15:08.771 --> 01:15:11.773
Come now, Armand of the
Roulin clan, take a seat,

01:15:11.774 --> 01:15:12.774
be welcome.

01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:15.377
Louise, drinks.

01:15:15.378 --> 01:15:16.286
What'll you have, wine?

01:15:16.287 --> 01:15:17.257
No, thank you.

01:15:17.258 --> 01:15:18.782
I had my fill last night.

01:15:18.783 --> 01:15:19.982
Ah, tea then.

01:15:19.983 --> 01:15:21.750
I have just the recipe.

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:24.664
Louise, you know
the one, chop-chop.

01:15:26.823 --> 01:15:28.564
So young man, I hear
you've been making

01:15:28.565 --> 01:15:32.628
something oi a name for
yourself these past two days.

01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:35.797
Believe me that
wasn't my intention.

01:15:35.798 --> 01:15:38.333
I just wanted to
deliver a letter.

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:42.237
From a dead man lo a
dead man I understand.

01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:46.008
Yeah, well I didn't
Know that when I set out.

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:47.579
A guy I met in Paris
thought you might have

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:50.312
the address for Theo's widow.

01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:52.623
Seems right the family
should have the letter.

01:15:52.624 --> 01:15:55.317
That's what my father reckons.

01:15:55.318 --> 01:15:57.628
Your father sounds
like a responsible man.

01:15:57.629 --> 01:15:59.154
I sympathize.

01:15:59.155 --> 01:16:01.533
I have to look after the
health of great artists.

01:16:01.534 --> 01:16:02.858
It is a burden.

01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:04.826
They are not peaceful souls.

01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:07.863
I understand because
I am an artist too.

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:10.198
That is why they trust me.

01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:12.668
And, Vincent (rusted you too?

01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:13.773
Yes, he did.

01:16:16.372 --> 01:16:18.774
Does it mailer now?

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:21.710
I was hoping you'd tell ma.

01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:23.845
Tell you what exactly?

01:16:23.846 --> 01:16:26.822
Vincent wrote to my father
six weeks before he died,

01:16:26.823 --> 01:16:28.853
and he said he fell
absolutely calm

01:16:28.854 --> 01:16:31.153
and in a normal slate.

01:16:31.154 --> 01:16:33.027
So I came here hoping
you could explain

01:16:33.028 --> 01:16:36.191
how he went from absolutely
calm and in a normal state

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:37.192
to suicidal.

01:16:39.128 --> 01:16:41.199
But, I reckon I know
the answer to that.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.664
Oh do you now?

01:16:42.665 --> 01:16:45.701
You're familiar with
melancholia are you?

01:16:45.702 --> 01:16:47.369
I wouldn't say so.

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.475
Sufferers can change
from feeling life

01:16:49.476 --> 01:16:52.574
is a wondrous joy to
being stuck in a pit

01:16:52.575 --> 01:16:55.577
of despair within six hours.

01:16:55.578 --> 01:16:59.347
So think what changes are
possible within six weeks.

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:01.850
But, I don't reckon that's it.

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:04.386
Ravoux girl said
he was happy here.

01:17:04.387 --> 01:17:08.090
She's obviously qualified
to make such a diagnosis.

01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:10.401
She saw him everyday,
said he was calm

01:17:10.402 --> 01:17:11.927
and seemed normal.

01:17:11.928 --> 01:17:14.602
Maybe he did seem that
way, maybe he was that way

01:17:14.603 --> 01:17:16.098
in the beginning.

01:17:16.099 --> 01:17:17.009
There he is.

01:17:17.010 --> 01:17:18.433
He's arrived.

01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:20.243
Leaving the asylum had
given him fresh hope.

01:17:20.244 --> 01:17:22.341
He didn't want for
much just his work

01:17:22.342 --> 01:17:23.772
from day to day.

01:17:23.773 --> 01:17:24.773
It's good to meet you.

01:17:24.774 --> 01:17:25.843
Find a little friendship.

01:17:25.844 --> 01:17:27.549
I've heard so much about you.

01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:28.851
All will be well.

01:17:30.079 --> 01:17:33.248
And, did he find
a little friendship?

01:17:33.249 --> 01:17:35.584
He had it from me.

01:17:35.585 --> 01:17:39.123
His friend Tanguy said
his star was finally rising.

01:17:39.124 --> 01:17:40.722
And, it was.

01:17:40.723 --> 01:17:44.259
With each new canvass, he
painted a shining star.

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:47.901
But, all of those stars were
surrounded by unfathomable,

01:17:47.902 --> 01:17:49.731
empty loneliness.

01:17:49.732 --> 01:17:52.770
You said he had your friendship
and his brother's love.

01:17:52.771 --> 01:17:54.942
I mean it seems like
everything was all right.

01:17:54.943 --> 01:17:58.940
Underneath he was deeply
afraid of the future.

01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:00.275
To the baby, yes.

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:02.051
Of his own and Theo's.

01:18:04.614 --> 01:18:07.891
Time to meet you little boy.

01:18:13.489 --> 01:18:17.092
I don't think he's
responding to your medicine.

01:18:17.093 --> 01:18:19.164
He knew that Theo had spent

01:18:19.165 --> 01:18:21.005
a small fortune on him.

01:18:25.268 --> 01:18:28.511
The knowledge oi this
tore into Vincent.

01:18:30.273 --> 01:18:31.273
Excuse me.

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:35.583
Theo could've
had a house like this

01:18:35.584 --> 01:18:38.582
with all the money he'd spent
on Vincent over the years.

01:18:38.583 --> 01:18:43.318
But, instead what did he have
for his new wife and baby'!

01:18:43.319 --> 01:18:47.426
Rooms full of paintings
that no one wanted to buy.

01:18:54.764 --> 01:18:58.166
Vincent's biggest fear
was that the burden of him

01:18:58.167 --> 01:19:00.545
would bring down his brother.

01:19:04.974 --> 01:19:07.147
So Vincent worried
a little about money.

01:19:07.148 --> 01:19:10.679
It's not like they
were starving is it?

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:14.184
Listen I don't reckon
he committed suicide.

01:19:16.285 --> 01:19:18.220
I reckon he was shot.

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:21.795
Have you been talking to Mazery?

01:19:21.796 --> 01:19:24.169
You heard his tale of how
the angle of the bullet

01:19:24.170 --> 01:19:28.463
was all wrong, that nobody shoots
themselves in the stomach?

01:19:28.464 --> 01:19:30.165
Well yeah.

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:33.535
What's to stop Vincent from
doing something improbable?

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:35.345
I mean cutting a piece of
your ear off and making

01:19:35.346 --> 01:19:38.342
a present of it to a whore
is hardly probable now is it?

01:19:38.343 --> 01:19:40.377
But, there was this
lad Rene who had a gun,

01:19:40.378 --> 01:19:42.750
who bullied Vincent and was
seen with him on that day.

01:19:42.751 --> 01:19:45.417
I was at Vincent's
bedside on that day,

01:19:45.418 --> 01:19:47.916
and he said he had shot
himself and told me

01:19:47.917 --> 01:19:49.551
not to blame anyone.

01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:50.819
Not to blame anyone?

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.322
Doesn't that sound
to you like he was

01:19:52.323 --> 01:19:53.595
trying to cover for someone?

01:19:53.596 --> 01:19:55.857
He wanted to die I know that.

01:19:55.858 --> 01:19:57.596
Why would he say
there's no one to blame

01:19:57.597 --> 01:19:59.573
unless he thought
someone might be blamed?

01:19:59.574 --> 01:20:03.271
He said that because
there was someone, me.

01:20:04.233 --> 01:20:05.233
I think he

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:10.912
took his life to
try and save Theo

01:20:13.743 --> 01:20:16.189
because of something I'd said.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.083
You see there was an
argument, and I said

01:20:22.084 --> 01:20:24.255
something to Vincent
that as his doctor

01:20:24.256 --> 01:20:25.698
I should never have said.

01:20:25.699 --> 01:20:27.956
But, he'd made me so angry.

01:20:27.957 --> 01:20:29.424
You know nothing about art!

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:30.870
He called me an artistic fraud.

01:20:30.871 --> 01:20:32.237
And, you are lying
especially lo yourself.

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:33.261
In a way I am.

01:20:33.262 --> 01:20:34.896
You are an artistic fraud.

01:20:34.897 --> 01:20:36.433
I desperately wanted
to be an artist,

01:20:36.434 --> 01:20:37.968
but my father made
me study medicine,

01:20:37.969 --> 01:20:40.402
and I failed to stand up to him.

01:20:40.403 --> 01:20:43.772
Vincent said I was living
a lie whilst he lived

01:20:43.773 --> 01:20:46.808
and struggled for the truth.

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:50.222
So I thought in the heat of
our argument, okay Vincent

01:20:50.223 --> 01:20:53.581
I'll give you your
precious truth.

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:57.325
I knew that Theo was in the
tertiary stages of syphilis,

01:20:57.326 --> 01:21:00.588
any stress financial,
emotional or physical

01:21:00.589 --> 01:21:01.727
could kill him.

01:21:05.962 --> 01:21:08.930
I said to Vincent,
"What do you think

01:21:08.931 --> 01:21:10.604
"the burden of
worrying about you

01:21:10.605 --> 01:21:12.634
"is doing to your brother?"

01:21:12.635 --> 01:21:14.936
It's quite likely killing him.

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:17.110
That is the price of
your truth, the price

01:21:17.111 --> 01:21:19.140
of your path as an artist.

01:21:19.141 --> 01:21:20.347
Is it worth it?

01:21:21.344 --> 01:21:23.847
That stopped the argument dead.

01:21:26.015 --> 01:21:27.015
Vincent?

01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:29.951
Vincent!

01:21:31.754 --> 01:21:33.165
Vincent come back!

01:21:35.358 --> 01:21:36.358
Vincent!

01:21:39.095 --> 01:21:42.770
Two weeks later, I am
sitting at his bedside,

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.474
and he is dying.

01:21:47.503 --> 01:21:52.374
The only words he said, "Maybe
it is better for everyone."

01:23:13.956 --> 01:23:16.129
Here a letter for a letter.

01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:20.605
Theo's widow is collecting
all his letters.

01:23:20.606 --> 01:23:22.363
She wants to publish them.

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:24.640
I'll make sure she gets that.

01:23:39.415 --> 01:23:41.326
In reading through
Vincent's letters to Theo,

01:23:41.327 --> 01:23:43.451
she came across this one.

01:23:43.452 --> 01:23:45.591
It moved her so much,
she copied it out

01:23:45.592 --> 01:23:46.999
and sent it to me.

01:23:50.226 --> 01:23:52.427
Why are you giving it to me?

01:23:52.428 --> 01:23:53.771
It is from when
he was starting out

01:23:53.772 --> 01:23:56.598
on his journey as an artist.

01:23:56.599 --> 01:23:58.579
Take it for your journey.

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:07.142
Thank you Dr. Gachet.

01:24:07.143 --> 01:24:10.352
Armand Roulin, good luck.

01:24:19.321 --> 01:24:20.455
Thanks a lot.

01:24:20.456 --> 01:24:22.290
No bother sir.

01:24:30.366 --> 01:24:34.473
Who am
I in the eyes of most people?

01:24:35.771 --> 01:24:39.446
A nobody, a non entity,
an unpleasant person.

01:24:42.845 --> 01:24:46.548
Someone who has not,
and never will have

01:24:46.549 --> 01:24:49.050
any position in society.

01:24:49.051 --> 01:24:51.657
In short, the lowest of the low.

01:24:56.058 --> 01:25:00.006
Well then even if that
were all absolutely true,

01:25:02.231 --> 01:25:05.735
then one day I will
have to show by my work

01:25:07.303 --> 01:25:10.910
what this nobody, this non
entity has in his heart.

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:28.489
I looked for you at the bar.

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:30.561
Any luck on the job from?

01:25:32.695 --> 01:25:33.695
Nothing.

01:25:35.164 --> 01:25:37.667
Lieutenant Milliet
says I should enlist.

01:25:37.668 --> 01:25:39.067
What for?

01:25:39.068 --> 01:25:42.174
Well I'm good at
fighting, aren't I?

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:48.209
Roulin's have always been that.

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:51.953
The trick is to know
what you're fighting for.

01:25:54.717 --> 01:25:56.684
Would you look at it?

01:25:56.685 --> 01:25:59.632
There's a whole
other world up there.

01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:04.967
Something we get to gaze upon
but don't fully understand.

01:26:06.862 --> 01:26:08.432
It reminds me of him.

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:14.943
It feels wrong all
that life snuffed out

01:26:15.938 --> 01:26:18.282
because of a stupid accident.

01:26:20.075 --> 01:26:24.912
I'm still wondering why he
would cover for those boys.

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:26.586
What I'm wondering is if people

01:26:26.587 --> 01:26:28.823
will appreciate what he did.

01:26:36.091 --> 01:26:38.002
You were looking for me?

01:26:39.928 --> 01:26:43.665
This arrived from
Holland this morning.

01:26:43.666 --> 01:26:45.839
It's from Jo, Theo's widow.

01:26:47.436 --> 01:26:50.645
It turns out Gachel
did send the letter.

01:26:53.909 --> 01:26:57.652
And, she was terribly
touched by what you did.

01:26:59.114 --> 01:27:00.615
She thought it only right
that you should know

01:27:00.616 --> 01:27:04.752
what was in it, so she
copied it out for us.

01:27:04.753 --> 01:27:07.922
She sends her, she
said something about-

01:27:07.923 --> 01:27:09.834
- Alright, give it here.

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:18.638
In the life of the painter,

01:27:18.639 --> 01:27:22.503
death may perhaps not be
the most difficult thing.

01:27:22.504 --> 01:27:27.375
For myself, I declare I
don't Know anything about it.

01:27:27.376 --> 01:27:32.113
But, the sight of the stars
always makes me dream.

01:27:32.114 --> 01:27:35.152
Why I say to myself should
those spots of light

01:27:35.153 --> 01:27:38.519
in the firmament bet
Inaccessible lo us?

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:41.694
Maybe we can take
death to go to a star

01:27:43.192 --> 01:27:45.827
and lo die peacefully of
old age would be to go there

01:27:45.828 --> 01:27:46.828
on foot.

01:27:49.365 --> 01:27:51.538
For the moment, I'm
going to go to bed

01:27:51.539 --> 01:27:56.537
because it's late, and I wish
you goodnight and good luck

01:27:56.538 --> 01:27:59.644
with a handshake,
your loving Vincent.
