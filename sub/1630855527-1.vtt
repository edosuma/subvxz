00:58.958 --> 01:00.958
LUCIE JANE BLACKMAN (AGE 21)

01:38.041 --> 01:42.666
More than a week has passed
since Lucie Blackman has gone missing.

01:52.375 --> 01:54.791
The Metropolitan Police Department

01:54.875 --> 01:58.958
has been investigating links
to a religious cult.

04:05.083 --> 04:09.083
A friend of mine who manages
a guesthouse contacted me…

04:10.708 --> 04:15.833
and said that he was very worried about
a 21-year-old girl named Lucie

04:15.916 --> 04:19.125
who lives in his guesthouse and that
he couldn't get in touch with her.

04:21.291 --> 04:24.875
It was the first time for my friend
to experience something like this

04:24.958 --> 04:26.708
and he was quite upset.

04:26.791 --> 04:28.708
And from his tense look,

04:29.208 --> 04:33.833
I felt that the situation was serious.

04:46.291 --> 04:48.708
BRITISH STEWARDESS KIDNAPPED BY A CULT

04:48.791 --> 04:50.041
ROPPONGI HOSTESS

04:50.125 --> 04:51.708
A 1-MILLION-YEN DEBT

04:51.791 --> 04:54.458
A PHONE CALL FROM A MYSTERIOUS MAN

05:01.125 --> 05:02.458
CALLED ON PHONE BY UNKNOWN PARTY

05:02.541 --> 05:03.541
SUICIDE ALSO CONSIDERED

05:36.375 --> 05:40.125
I was in charge of
the Lucie case as a superintendent.

05:45.208 --> 05:49.625
In the beginning, it was possible
that she had simply run away,

05:49.708 --> 05:51.916
so we needed to know
from her family in detail

05:52.000 --> 05:58.333
whether she had any reason for doing so.

06:03.083 --> 06:04.125
Back then…

06:04.666 --> 06:10.750
there were a lot of foreigners
who overstayed or worked illegally,

06:11.708 --> 06:14.791
and many of them went missing quite often.

06:20.750 --> 06:23.083
So, when I first heard about it,

06:23.166 --> 06:27.250
I wasn’t sure
whether it was a criminal case or not.

07:44.166 --> 07:47.000
LOOKING FOR MISSING BRITISH WOMAN

08:41.000 --> 08:42.291
Any information would be helpful.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.500
Please call us.

10:36.458 --> 10:41.583
I met with Tim on behalf of the police
and explained the situation.

10:43.791 --> 10:49.458
I hadn't had much experience

10:49.541 --> 10:53.625
of talking to people from other countries,

10:53.708 --> 11:00.708
so I was surprised by the questions
he had in certain areas.

11:01.833 --> 11:06.916
He asked me whether I had done
a proper security camera investigation.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
At that time,

11:08.083 --> 11:12.500
I explained to him the limited use
of security cameras in Japan

11:12.583 --> 11:15.250
because of privacy concerns.

11:15.750 --> 11:21.625
He said, "Mitsuzane, you must be joking."

11:22.125 --> 11:27.041
"In London,
there are cameras on every street,

11:27.125 --> 11:29.083
and they are all made in Japan."

18:25.208 --> 18:28.375
The first team which was involved
in the Lucie case from the beginning

18:28.458 --> 18:29.875
was the Teramae team.

18:29.958 --> 18:35.125
Our team only heard from them
that they had identified a suspect.

18:37.166 --> 18:42.750
He was a Japanese man who frequented
the hostess clubs in the Roppongi area,

18:43.333 --> 18:44.708
including Casablanca.

18:47.375 --> 18:53.666
So, we were ordered to bring that suspect
into custody and find out

18:54.250 --> 18:56.875
whether he was innocent or not.

18:58.250 --> 19:01.583
We were nervous that the suspect

19:01.666 --> 19:05.500
would find out what we were doing,

19:06.125 --> 19:09.000
and would kill her
if she were still alive.

19:10.458 --> 19:13.750
We approached his car
before he went to work.

19:13.833 --> 19:16.791
We asked that
he voluntarily come in for questioning.

19:17.750 --> 19:18.750
We caught him

19:19.333 --> 19:25.708
and accompanied him to
the nearest police station to investigate.

19:28.875 --> 19:33.750
The guy had an alibi,
which we ended up corroborating.

19:34.666 --> 19:41.250
The suspect was not the one

19:42.125 --> 19:43.791
that took Lucie.

19:45.666 --> 19:50.166
We were forced to
go back to the drawing board.

20:56.625 --> 20:59.458
You can put up the sign on the pole,
but you cannot do it there.

22:41.375 --> 22:44.250
The Japanese Prime Minister had said,

22:44.333 --> 22:48.166
"The Japanese police
will catch the suspect."

22:49.250 --> 22:55.166
We thought that’s an easy thing
to say but it's not easy to do.

22:56.041 --> 23:01.666
We felt that pressure ourselves.

23:03.916 --> 23:07.125
I felt that there was

23:07.208 --> 23:11.208
a slight inconsistency
in the investigation policy.

23:11.291 --> 23:14.916
So, some of my cops
started to make their own moves.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
I call them Suppon detectives,

23:18.083 --> 23:21.541
detectives who don't let go of a lead.

23:23.791 --> 23:28.416
We thought it’d be better to start
the investigation from the beginning

23:28.500 --> 23:34.250
instead of wasting time on red herrings.

23:40.125 --> 23:44.958
Kuku is tenacious and persistent.

23:45.041 --> 23:48.833
Once he bites,
he never lets go, like a suppon.

23:50.083 --> 23:56.666
We spent nights
going over the daily reports

23:56.750 --> 24:03.750
that the main unit filed from day one,

24:03.833 --> 24:10.375
and checked everything in them.

24:13.125 --> 24:15.916
While I was checking the reports

24:16.000 --> 24:19.166
to understand how
the investigation had been conducted,

24:19.250 --> 24:21.666
I discovered a report

24:21.750 --> 24:25.041
from the Roppongi area
where there were many clubs.

24:26.666 --> 24:31.875
A foreign hostess working at a club

24:31.958 --> 24:36.166
was invited by a regular male customer
for a drive to the seaside.

24:36.750 --> 24:38.916
At some point, she fell unconscious

24:39.500 --> 24:41.625
and slept for many hours.

24:41.708 --> 24:44.041
When she woke up,
her head was hurting badly

24:44.125 --> 24:45.791
and she suspected that
she had been drugged.

24:47.541 --> 24:50.083
They said the manager of the club
who came up with the information

24:50.166 --> 24:53.666
was an unreliable guy.

24:54.791 --> 24:59.375
No one should rely on what he says.

25:02.500 --> 25:06.458
After reading this,
we thought that was ridiculous.

25:06.541 --> 25:11.750
A person like this
might provide a legitimate clue.

25:42.708 --> 25:46.875
We would find club owners claiming that

25:46.958 --> 25:51.041
a girl who worked for them
had the same experience.

25:53.750 --> 25:57.333
These stories would pop up

25:58.458 --> 25:59.875
here and there.

26:04.708 --> 26:10.583
So we decided to talk to all the employees

26:11.166 --> 26:15.208
from every club.

26:16.291 --> 26:21.375
In the beginning,
the ladies who worked at the clubs

26:21.458 --> 26:23.625
didn’t want to come forward.

26:56.583 --> 26:59.833
We couldn’t talk to them at work,

27:00.333 --> 27:03.916
so at first, we’d stop them on the streets

27:04.000 --> 27:08.708
and ask them questions there.

27:12.583 --> 27:17.416
Eventually, several women came forward

27:17.500 --> 27:21.166
because they wanted to help us find Lucie.

27:21.916 --> 27:23.791
In the end,

27:23.875 --> 27:28.708
we discovered that all these women
had experiences that were very similar.

27:53.125 --> 28:00.125
Criminals generally stick to
the same modus operandi.

28:00.833 --> 28:07.791
Just like thieves have their own way
of breaking and entering,

28:07.875 --> 28:09.916
it's a habit.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.083
Those habits don't change.

28:15.375 --> 28:17.125
He drove them in luxury cars

28:17.208 --> 28:20.500
like Porsche, Mercedes-Benz,

28:21.166 --> 28:23.541
and so on.

28:24.583 --> 28:27.000
The invitations were to go
to a place with a view of the ocean

28:27.083 --> 28:28.458
or to have dinner somewhere.

28:33.958 --> 28:35.416
And he used drugs.

28:36.416 --> 28:40.166
The victims said they felt
as if they had been drugged.

28:46.375 --> 28:52.791
They’d wake up
feeling uncomfortable all over their body.

28:54.291 --> 28:56.166
Some threw up.

28:58.416 --> 29:03.666
Some felt a burning sensation.

29:08.666 --> 29:10.250
I felt very sorry for them.

30:26.833 --> 30:31.083
There were a lot of people
from the press around Tim.

30:32.708 --> 30:37.041
We judged that he might reveal something

30:38.166 --> 30:40.000
that would hinder the investigation.

31:02.291 --> 31:07.916
I always said that
the investigation is progressing steadily.

31:09.625 --> 31:11.458
"I can't tell you about it yet."

33:00.666 --> 33:02.500
Thank you. Okay.

34:36.083 --> 34:38.166
So, we had discovered numerous reports

34:38.250 --> 34:43.666
of a man taking hostesses out for a drive

34:43.750 --> 34:46.166
and then drugging them
in order to molest them.

34:47.708 --> 34:49.500
One of the victims
was Jessie from Australia.

34:49.583 --> 34:53.583
Her case happened three years earlier.

34:58.625 --> 35:00.083
She had written

35:00.166 --> 35:03.291
the man's name and cell phone number

35:03.375 --> 35:06.208
in her old notebook,

35:06.291 --> 35:10.125
which she left in Australia.

35:10.208 --> 35:12.208
The notebook arrived from Australia.

35:12.291 --> 35:13.458
We asked her father

35:14.541 --> 35:19.166
to send the notebook back to Japan
so we can see it with our own eyes.

35:23.083 --> 35:27.125
She got so mad
that she scribbled over the number.

35:27.208 --> 35:30.041
We held it up to the light
to try to identify the digits.

35:35.916 --> 35:38.833
His name was "Yuji Honda"

35:38.916 --> 35:45.416
and his cell phone number ending
in 3301 was written in the notebook.

35:48.625 --> 35:50.583
So, we started checking on

35:50.666 --> 35:55.250
the numbers that had been called
from this phone.

35:57.666 --> 35:59.375
The number was still in use.

36:00.291 --> 36:04.208
We retrieved the phone records
of the number.

36:04.291 --> 36:08.666
We found ten or so
phone numbers it called.

36:10.416 --> 36:14.791
And one of those numbers…

36:16.708 --> 36:20.791
belonged to Lucie.

36:38.666 --> 36:40.208
The suspect created

36:40.708 --> 36:45.583
many false identities, so that
they could never be traced back to him.

36:46.791 --> 36:51.208
We asked the cell phone company
to do a location search

36:51.291 --> 36:53.166
to find where the caller was.

36:55.041 --> 36:56.291
At three o'clock,

36:56.375 --> 37:01.250
we found a call that was picked up
by an antenna near Tokyo Tower.

37:02.250 --> 37:05.791
One minute or five minutes later,

37:05.875 --> 37:11.875
the signal was picked up
in a completely different direction.

37:11.958 --> 37:13.375
Another five minutes later,

37:13.458 --> 37:15.541
the antenna in the west
was picking up a call.

37:16.791 --> 37:20.375
Another five minutes later, an antenna
in the east was picking up a call.

37:22.416 --> 37:29.208
No car can go that fast
from one location to another.

37:29.291 --> 37:30.500
It was a mystery to me.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.375
Then I thought,

37:33.458 --> 37:36.291
if the calls were picked up
by four antennas in the four directions,

37:36.375 --> 37:39.208
there was a possibility that the caller

37:39.291 --> 37:43.458
was calling in the intersectional area.

38:19.708 --> 38:22.666
We showed our police badges
to the manager.

38:23.708 --> 38:26.375
On the sixth floor,
two rooms were being used

38:26.458 --> 38:29.958
by a company called Plant Orihara.

38:30.666 --> 38:36.333
The manager said
the owner was an unusual person.

38:36.416 --> 38:39.333
He walked past the manager,

38:39.416 --> 38:42.958
he never greeted,

38:43.041 --> 38:47.875
and always looked down
and didn't show his face.

38:50.416 --> 38:55.625
He drives a lot of luxury foreign cars.

38:56.250 --> 39:00.250
Porsche, Mercedes-Benz,
Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce…

39:00.958 --> 39:05.083
All the cars mentioned
in the testimonies were there.

39:06.708 --> 39:12.541
I didn't know if P-Orihara
was a foreigner’s name or a company name.

39:12.625 --> 39:15.333
There was no information.

39:15.416 --> 39:18.916
The name of the resident was not listed.

39:40.833 --> 39:47.208
Among the hostesses who we spoke to,

39:47.750 --> 39:54.625
a few women were willing to go on record.

39:55.666 --> 39:59.583
One of them was Monica from England.

40:00.666 --> 40:04.583
I think it was a man
who called himself "Koji."

40:07.500 --> 40:12.750
It was the 10th of October in 1997.

40:12.833 --> 40:16.166
She met a "Koji" in Roppongi,

40:17.166 --> 40:22.208
and they drove to
a resort apartment building

40:22.291 --> 40:24.166
with a view of the ocean.

40:26.750 --> 40:31.916
She remembered a row of palm trees,

40:32.583 --> 40:37.750
and Zushi Marina was
the only place in the area

40:37.833 --> 40:41.125
that had that.

40:42.375 --> 40:47.250
She might remember more details,

40:47.333 --> 40:50.458
so we went together to Zushi Marina.

41:05.416 --> 41:07.833
Monica said this was it.

41:07.916 --> 41:12.625
This resort apartment
was the place I was taken to.

41:14.416 --> 41:19.500
We drove around the premises,

41:20.250 --> 41:25.208
and she thought
it might have been Building 4 or 7,

41:25.291 --> 41:27.166
but she couldn’t confirm
which building it was.

41:28.500 --> 41:31.708
I remember we went to a nearby restaurant

41:32.625 --> 41:37.333
and showed Lucie’s photo to a waitress.

41:38.791 --> 41:43.625
She told me that
she was sure it was this woman

41:43.708 --> 41:46.041
who came here on July 1.

41:46.125 --> 41:48.125
LUCIE JANE BLACKMAN (AGE 21)
175CM TALL, MEDIUM BUILD

41:48.208 --> 41:49.541
When I asked her if she was alone,

41:50.958 --> 41:52.500
she said "No, she was with a man."

42:01.250 --> 42:05.041
I wanted to get
the residents' list of Zushi Marina.

42:05.791 --> 42:08.458
I went and talked to
the assistant manager.

42:08.958 --> 42:13.250
I explained the urgency
of the situation and he understood.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.958
I had to rule them out one by one.

42:21.041 --> 42:24.583
It's tricky and time-consuming work,

42:25.083 --> 42:29.416
but if this person is alive,
we need to free her as soon as possible.

42:30.000 --> 42:34.291
As I went through them one by one,
all of them turned up empty,

42:35.000 --> 42:39.250
but I had a gut feeling
that one of them was suspicious.

42:40.625 --> 42:44.875
So, I searched for a man

42:44.958 --> 42:49.125
who had a lot of luxury foreign cars.

42:50.416 --> 42:52.416
A person called "Obara" came to the front.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.583
When I heard that,

42:55.666 --> 42:59.541
I remembered that…

43:00.250 --> 43:03.000
at the Moto-Akasaka Towers,

43:04.041 --> 43:07.708
there was a company named Plant Orihara.

43:07.791 --> 43:08.791
PLANT ORIHARA

43:08.875 --> 43:12.166
O BARA

43:12.250 --> 43:15.000
The kanji characters for "Obara"…

43:15.083 --> 43:16.333
ORI HARA

43:16.416 --> 43:19.666
…can also be read as "Orihara."

43:26.625 --> 43:29.125
I got goosebumps
and felt a shiver all over my body.

43:35.833 --> 43:42.166
A310 JOJI OBARA

43:44.958 --> 43:48.208
We found out that Joji Obara…

43:49.375 --> 43:53.791
had been previously arrested in Wakayama…

43:53.875 --> 43:58.750
for disguising himself as a woman

43:58.833 --> 44:02.000
and secretly filming in
a women's restroom.

44:03.875 --> 44:08.458
I talked to the officers
who worked on that case at the time,

44:08.541 --> 44:11.208
and I asked them what he was like.

44:11.291 --> 44:13.458
They said "thoroughly resistant."

44:14.541 --> 44:16.875
Upon his arrest,

44:16.958 --> 44:20.541
he refused to take a mugshot.

44:21.208 --> 44:25.333
He averted his face
and wouldn't cooperate at all.

44:27.875 --> 44:31.500
I asked for it to be faxed to me.

44:43.541 --> 44:48.416
The fax machine back then had low quality,
and the photo came out quite dark.

44:49.958 --> 44:53.000
So, we put together
about 100 photos of suspects

44:53.083 --> 44:55.000
and showed them to the victims.

44:58.166 --> 45:01.375
Monica and Jessie

45:01.458 --> 45:08.083
both singled out Obara's picture
without hesitation.

45:09.666 --> 45:11.875
For the first time,

45:11.958 --> 45:16.625
we had a real name
to attach to all the pseudonyms.

45:43.875 --> 45:48.083
We couldn't pin him
with anything on Lucie,

45:48.166 --> 45:49.875
but we thought we had enough to arrest him

45:51.375 --> 45:53.416
based on other victims.

45:58.875 --> 46:03.041
At six o'clock in the morning,
we were already in position.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.833
Investigators are nervous
when they make an arrest in any case.

46:13.458 --> 46:17.291
I was very nervous.

46:17.375 --> 46:19.250
We placed two people
by the emergency exit,

46:19.333 --> 46:22.041
two people on the side of the window,

46:23.375 --> 46:26.041
and one person by the door
to keep a lookout.

46:26.125 --> 46:28.750
I think there were
about seven people in total.

46:29.708 --> 46:34.750
I was told by radio that the suspect
was awake and turned on the TV.

46:34.833 --> 46:38.083
So, I continued to monitor the situation.

46:39.458 --> 46:44.916
He always went out to buy the newspaper
at about seven o'clock,

46:45.000 --> 46:48.041
so I thought
there was no need to barge in.

46:48.125 --> 46:54.041
Obara didn’t look like
a bad-tempered person.

46:54.875 --> 46:57.125
I thought he wouldn't be violent.

46:57.791 --> 47:01.708
But I was worried
about him jumping out of the window.

47:01.791 --> 47:03.250
That's all I was thinking about.

47:05.875 --> 47:09.458
Just before seven o'clock,
the door opened.

47:10.666 --> 47:15.416
When I asked "Are you Obara?",
his face suddenly dropped.

47:16.375 --> 47:18.000
He said "Yes, I am."

47:21.833 --> 47:24.458
I think he knew the arrest was imminent.

48:19.416 --> 48:20.583
Please stand back.

48:22.916 --> 48:28.125
I was in charge of the crime scene
at Zushi Marina No. 4.

48:29.375 --> 48:31.833
We found

48:32.583 --> 48:37.083
a lot of drugs and alcohol.

48:38.291 --> 48:41.375
What I remember vividly

48:41.458 --> 48:45.750
was the metal fitting on the ceiling.

48:47.958 --> 48:49.791
I remember wondering

48:49.875 --> 48:53.083
what kind of metal fitting it was.

48:58.416 --> 49:03.125
I was in charge of the search
and seizure at Moto-Akasaka Towers.

49:03.625 --> 49:08.625
The most memorable item was his notebook.

49:11.875 --> 49:13.708
I don't know when he wrote it,

49:13.791 --> 49:17.500
but one entry said
he was going to become evil,

49:18.166 --> 49:19.833
that he was going
to devote himself to evil.

49:22.291 --> 49:27.541
He rapidly changed his way of thinking
to become thoroughly evil,

49:27.625 --> 49:31.041
and transformed into a sort of monster.

49:49.375 --> 49:52.916
We confiscated a lot of videotapes,

49:54.625 --> 49:56.916
and I'm not talking
about just two or three.

50:04.250 --> 50:07.375
The videotapes were labeled with names,
although not with full names.

50:09.041 --> 50:14.250
What Obara did was recorded on videotapes.

50:15.000 --> 50:21.250
I don't think it's something
I should talk about again.

50:45.166 --> 50:51.916
We learned that
the metal fittings on the ceiling…

50:55.458 --> 51:00.875
were used to lift the victims' legs.

51:01.916 --> 51:06.000
He doesn't think of people as people,

51:06.666 --> 51:09.166
but just as dolls.

51:09.250 --> 51:11.500
I’d never seen a case…

51:13.541 --> 51:19.458
I’d never seen anything so despicable.

51:20.083 --> 51:23.833
I never thought
there were people like him.

51:49.541 --> 51:52.166
Our goal was to find Lucie.

51:55.500 --> 51:56.875
So, I felt the pressure.

51:58.625 --> 52:02.250
But with so much evidence against him,
I thought we had a chance.

52:04.166 --> 52:05.750
While I was talking to him,

52:06.333 --> 52:12.416
I felt that he was
a very warped individual.

52:14.416 --> 52:18.333
He denied everything
concerning his crimes.

52:20.125 --> 52:22.208
Even when I showed him evidence,

52:23.416 --> 52:25.166
he insisted that all of it was an act.

52:26.166 --> 52:29.333
They were all paid.

52:29.958 --> 52:34.791
He'd make excuses like that.
But, that’s all he admitted.

53:22.708 --> 53:24.333
When I saw the video evidence,

53:24.416 --> 53:27.625
I thought this crime was completely
comparable to a murder case.

53:29.833 --> 53:33.750
For a woman,
sexual crimes are as bad as murder.

53:38.833 --> 53:44.916
I remember that we set up
an analysis team in a large room.

53:45.000 --> 53:49.958
It’s a room that could fit
dozens of people.

53:52.541 --> 53:54.166
We were short on staff,

53:54.916 --> 54:00.500
so we had to send young officers
from the riot police to help the team.

54:02.541 --> 54:04.250
The victims would change,

54:04.333 --> 54:09.083
but they saw the same crimes
over and over again.

54:09.166 --> 54:13.833
Several of those young officers

54:13.916 --> 54:19.125
had mental breakdowns.

54:23.416 --> 54:25.750
I went to some of the victims' houses

54:26.583 --> 54:31.291
and interviewed them.

54:31.375 --> 54:34.875
They woke up and weren’t aware
of anything happening to them,

54:34.958 --> 54:36.916
that’s what they all said.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.625
But we had the evidence to prove to them
that something had happened.

54:39.708 --> 54:42.125
But showing them that was the hardest bit.

54:44.708 --> 54:47.250
They were covering their eyes.

54:47.333 --> 54:49.666
One person said,
"Say it’s not me, was it me?"

54:49.750 --> 54:54.333
Some said, "That was in the past
and I don’t want to take it any further."

54:54.416 --> 54:59.208
One victim had a nosebleed.

54:59.291 --> 55:06.041
She must have been suffering.

55:08.250 --> 55:11.166
I explained to them that we need to arrest
this perpetrator and punish him

55:11.250 --> 55:13.041
and in order to do that,

55:13.666 --> 55:15.041
we desperately needed their help.

55:17.208 --> 55:18.791
We didn’t want Obara to get away with it.

55:21.166 --> 55:23.208
That's how we felt.

55:24.750 --> 55:29.791
And that's what I tried to explain
to the victims.

55:33.791 --> 55:35.250
That was the only way.

56:11.875 --> 56:18.583
He would take a towel and a brown bottle

56:18.666 --> 56:21.291
and pour liquid from this bottle.

56:21.375 --> 56:26.666
He then placed it on the victim's face.

56:33.125 --> 56:37.458
There were always
towels draped over everyone’s face.

56:38.708 --> 56:42.791
Among the seized items
were sleep-inducing drugs,

56:42.875 --> 56:46.958
and there were large quantities
of ether, chloroform,

56:47.041 --> 56:50.375
and other illegal drugs

56:51.125 --> 56:52.583
that have a sleep-inducing effect.

56:55.208 --> 56:57.833
As I was looking at
various footage of the victims,

56:57.916 --> 57:00.291
I noticed one particular woman.

57:01.041 --> 57:02.125
Suddenly,

57:02.208 --> 57:09.208
her hands started shaking.

57:09.291 --> 57:15.333
I wondered why she was doing
these movements while unconscious.

57:17.291 --> 57:21.750
Chloroform toxicity
can lead to acute hepatitis

57:21.833 --> 57:26.416
which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy.

57:26.500 --> 57:30.916
And I found out that one of the symptoms
is called flapping tremor.

57:31.541 --> 57:37.166
As I researched
the situation of the victim further,

57:37.250 --> 57:40.458
I discovered that she was
a 21-year-old woman named Carita,

57:40.541 --> 57:44.416
and she had died.

01:01:17.291 --> 01:01:20.666
We were still primarily focused on Lucie.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:25.416
We had to analyze every piece of evidence

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:29.291
in order to rescue her.

01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:36.875
Obara had a habit of collecting things,

01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:42.125
and he kept
a lot of receipts in his apartment.

01:01:42.666 --> 01:01:46.791
The evidence analysis team
examined them closely

01:01:47.291 --> 01:01:51.166
and they created
a timeline of Obara's actions.

01:02:04.291 --> 01:02:08.083
According to our analysis,
on July 1st, at around 3 p.m.,

01:02:08.833 --> 01:02:13.000
Obara met Lucie and headed to Zushi.

01:02:13.083 --> 01:02:14.875
On the way to Zushi,

01:02:14.958 --> 01:02:20.791
Obara and Lucie stopped at a restaurant
near the yacht harbor in Zushi Marina.

01:02:20.875 --> 01:02:25.041
This was confirmed
by Assistant Inspector Asano at the time.

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:29.291
Then in the evening, around 5 p.m.,

01:02:30.375 --> 01:02:34.083
they went to Obara's apartment
at Zushi Marina.

01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:38.833
This was where
Lucie's whereabouts became unknown.

01:02:40.375 --> 01:02:45.083
Between the night of July 2nd
and early morning of July 3rd,

01:02:45.166 --> 01:02:47.958
Obara drove back to Tokyo.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
On July 4th, Obara did a lot of shopping.

01:02:55.333 --> 01:03:01.791
On July 5th, Obara visited
the Blue Sea Aburatsubo apartment,

01:03:01.875 --> 01:03:06.291
one of many properties that he owned.

01:03:08.166 --> 01:03:09.333
The next day,

01:03:09.416 --> 01:03:15.333
a resident complained to the manager
about noise coming from Obara's apartment.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:26.000
JULY 4TH, 2000 (TUE)
CASH REGISTER 012

01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:31.166
CHAINSAW - 35,800 YEN
TENT - 4,200 YEN

01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:42.333
Our analysis led us
to the conclusion that…

01:03:45.958 --> 01:03:50.083
Lucie lost her life
on the night of July 1st.

01:03:53.416 --> 01:03:55.000
Within the next few days,

01:03:55.583 --> 01:03:59.541
her body was transported
from Zushi Marina to Blue Sea Aburatsubo.

01:04:01.875 --> 01:04:05.375
And there was a high probability
she was dismembered there.

01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:14.166
After analyzing
various pieces of evidence,

01:04:14.916 --> 01:04:18.458
we had no choice but to think so.

01:04:24.291 --> 01:04:26.000
For the Lucie case,

01:04:26.083 --> 01:04:28.625
we also wanted good evidence,

01:04:28.708 --> 01:04:32.458
but we only had
circumstantial evidence that he did it.

01:04:35.291 --> 01:04:38.375
We needed hard evidence
to build the case for Lucie…

01:04:39.958 --> 01:04:44.083
but without a body,

01:04:44.166 --> 01:04:45.750
we couldn’t try him for murder.

01:05:09.875 --> 01:05:12.583
The prosecutor said it would be difficult

01:05:13.333 --> 01:05:19.708
to make a case without a confession,

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:27.208
so we knew that
we had to find the body no matter what.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.250
We began to look for any spots

01:05:35.958 --> 01:05:41.000
where a body might be buried in the area.

01:05:46.958 --> 01:05:50.000
We had no idea where she could be.

01:05:51.666 --> 01:05:55.250
It couldn’t be that far
from the apartment in Aburatsubo.

01:05:57.041 --> 01:06:02.750
Upper management proposed
to give us one final week to search.

01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:07.375
Once the week was up,
they had to shut us down.

01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:12.916
My stomach was in knots.

01:06:17.375 --> 01:06:19.000
I told my men
that this is our last chance.

01:06:19.833 --> 01:06:21.666
I was dreading

01:06:22.333 --> 01:06:25.625
what would happen if we didn’t find her.

01:06:30.791 --> 01:06:36.500
We really need to nail this guy
with solid jail time.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.458
That was how I felt.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.708
The spots we had to search,

01:06:48.666 --> 01:06:50.500
the terrain was dangerous.

01:06:52.833 --> 01:06:54.833
We did it over several days…

01:06:56.666 --> 01:06:58.666
until we were filthy and foul-smelling.

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:25.375
We went to the coast
at 8:15 in the morning.

01:07:33.375 --> 01:07:35.750
There were a few caves.

01:07:39.083 --> 01:07:40.666
I relied on my hunch.

01:07:53.208 --> 01:08:00.208
The area was littered with things
that have washed ashore.

01:08:00.291 --> 01:08:04.916
So, I cleared everything inside the cave.

01:08:05.833 --> 01:08:08.500
When I cleared it,

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:10.916
there was a bathtub.

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:16.875
I flipped it over.

01:08:19.375 --> 01:08:21.125
"These are carnivorous bugs," I said.

01:08:24.583 --> 01:08:29.583
I cleared that area
and kept digging around it.

01:08:35.291 --> 01:08:38.583
At first, it seemed like
a big burlap sack.

01:08:39.083 --> 01:08:43.083
And when I opened it,

01:08:45.333 --> 01:08:47.083
I was certain it was Lucie.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:53.250
I was standing on
a rocky place near the cave

01:08:53.333 --> 01:08:54.708
when my phone rang…

01:08:55.375 --> 01:08:58.458
and I heard Nozoe's voice say "It’s here!"

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:03.708
I couldn’t figure out what he was saying.

01:09:03.791 --> 01:09:06.500
So, I told him to wait there
because I was coming over right now.

01:09:13.166 --> 01:09:16.916
A huge flock of kites
had gathered above the scene.

01:09:18.166 --> 01:09:19.791
Squawking.

01:09:20.375 --> 01:09:26.875
They caught the smell of death
and started circling in the sky.

01:12:08.333 --> 01:12:12.041
We can now indict him for Lucie's murder.

01:12:13.708 --> 01:12:20.708
For the sake of the victims,
he should be given the maximum penalty.

01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:34.541
I was so disappointed.

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:39.791
I couldn’t believe
he was found not guilty.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
The investigators at that time
were just angry more than surprised.

01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:48.291
He had done such terrible things.

01:16:36.375 --> 01:16:40.166
In 2010, I had a chance

01:16:40.875 --> 01:16:44.125
to visit Lucie’s grave
and pay my respects.

01:16:44.708 --> 01:16:49.541
So, I went to England.

01:16:55.916 --> 01:17:00.750
Jane treated us to afternoon tea,

01:17:00.833 --> 01:17:02.875
which was a first experience for me.

01:17:02.958 --> 01:17:05.208
I heard it’s a form of hospitality

01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:10.666
and I was very much impressed
by her warmth.

01:17:13.708 --> 01:17:17.500
Lucie’s grave is in a churchyard.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.125
Her name was written on the marker.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.375
"A star lighting in our sky,"

01:17:28.458 --> 01:17:31.958
the tombstone said.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.166
The fact that Lucie came from
a foreign country to work,

01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:45.166
and then became a victim of such a crime

01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:50.583
has left certain emotions in my heart.

01:17:55.708 --> 01:17:59.041
Every year since,
we go there to appease her spirit

01:18:01.166 --> 01:18:07.291
and to pray that she rests in peace.

01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:13.458
We’ve been going there
for the last 20 years.

01:18:13.541 --> 01:18:15.541
I think this is a rare occurrence.
