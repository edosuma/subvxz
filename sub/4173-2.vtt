WEBVTT

00:03.460 --> 00:04.927
Have fun
at the party.

00:04.929 --> 00:06.796
Thanks for having the boys
over tonight, Vivian.

00:06.798 --> 00:08.097
Oh, no problem,
Linda.

00:08.099 --> 00:10.066
I have all the
neighborhood kids tonight.

00:10.068 --> 00:13.536
Come on, come on.
I don't wanna be late
for my first grown-up party.

00:13.538 --> 00:16.239
Okay, hon.
Bye, everyone!
Happy New Year!

00:16.241 --> 00:17.407
Bye, guys!
Goodbye.

00:17.409 --> 00:18.574
ALL: Happy New Year!

00:18.576 --> 00:21.911
We've got noisemakers,
balloons, confetti.

00:21.913 --> 00:23.446
And of course,
we'll all stay up
till midnight

00:23.448 --> 00:25.315
and watch
the New Year's Eve
ball drop.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.216
Baljeet's already out.
Wake up, will you?

00:27.218 --> 00:29.018
(GROANS)
You're drooling
all over my arm.

00:29.020 --> 00:31.054
You know,
saliva is 98% water,

00:31.056 --> 00:34.891
and the other 2%
is made up of very
beneficial electrolytes.

00:34.893 --> 00:36.526
It is gross,
but it is science.

00:36.528 --> 00:38.895
You're lucky
the gross factor outweighs
the science factor,

00:38.897 --> 00:41.097
or you'd have
a one-way ticket
to wedgie town.

00:41.099 --> 00:43.466
Well, it'll be fun
to finally see
the ball drop.

00:43.468 --> 00:45.568
Oh, it's a wonderful
tradition.

00:45.570 --> 00:47.170
And of course,
there's the other
tradition

00:47.172 --> 00:49.305
of kissing someone
special at midnight.

00:49.307 --> 00:51.541
Well, then, I know
what we're gonna do tonight.

00:51.543 --> 00:56.546
We're gonna make
our own New Year's ball
and drop it from outer space!

00:56.548 --> 00:59.849
Your mother is right,
Phineas. You have such
an active imagination.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.851
(GIGGLES)
Not active enough.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.219
I'm going to make
some hot chocolate.

01:03.221 --> 01:05.221
You kids come on in
when you want to warm up.

01:05.223 --> 01:07.023
Hey, where's
your platypus?

01:10.227 --> 01:13.396
<i>Good morning, Agent P.</i>
<i>Sorry about the cold climae</i>
<i>inside your lair.</i>

01:13.398 --> 01:16.532
<i>See, the heating system</i>
<i>is on the fritz, and we had</i>
<i>to call a guy in from Aruba.</i>

01:16.534 --> 01:19.969
<i>But I can assure you that we</i>
<i>are all in the same boat her.</i>

01:19.971 --> 01:23.906
<i>You're, you're not</i>
<i>alone in this. We are</i>
<i>all sharing the pain.</i>

01:23.908 --> 01:26.542
(CLEARS THROAT)
<i>Awkward.</i>

01:26.544 --> 01:28.177
<i>Race youo</i>
<i>the Wet Ski!</i>

01:28.179 --> 01:30.580
<i>Um, uh, Doof's doing</i>
<i>something at City Hall.</i>

01:30.582 --> 01:32.882
<i>Put a stop</i>
<i>to whatever it is.</i>
<i>Hey, Carl!</i>

01:32.884 --> 01:34.951
<i>I get the blue one!</i>
<i>(GROANS)</i>

01:34.953 --> 01:37.353
Okay, Phineas!
We're good to go!

01:37.355 --> 01:38.888
Great. Bring her down.

01:40.057 --> 01:41.958
How's the soldering
going up there?

01:41.960 --> 01:43.092
Ferb is almost done.

01:43.094 --> 01:44.894
How are you doing, Buford?

01:44.896 --> 01:47.630
Why do I have to paint?
Painting is for babies
and beatniks.

01:47.632 --> 01:52.902
It's a super-sealer that'll
protect us from the cold,
dark vacuum of space.

01:52.904 --> 01:56.572
Hey, Phineas.
Mind if we see
the inside?

01:56.574 --> 02:01.577
Check it out. A multi-level
New Year's ball with
punch bowl sailing...

02:01.579 --> 02:03.446
Ahoy!
PHINEAS:
...balloon room,

02:03.448 --> 02:06.983
the bed of a thousand coats,
an Infinity Slide,
and through here,

02:06.985 --> 02:08.518
the Grand Ballroom.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.520
In other words,
a ball within a ball!

02:10.522 --> 02:11.654
(IRVING YELLS)
Irving?

02:11.656 --> 02:14.290
How do I get out of here?

02:14.292 --> 02:17.326
CHORUS:
<i>♪ Doofenshmirtz</i>
<i>Evil Incorporated! ♪</i>

02:17.328 --> 02:19.328
NORM: Happy New Year!

02:19.330 --> 02:22.298
Norm, I told you,
you don't celebrate
till midnight, not all day.

02:22.300 --> 02:25.968
What if midnight never comes?
Then you've squandered
a whole day celebrating.

02:25.970 --> 02:28.304
You ever think
of that, tough guy?
(GLASS BREAKS)

02:28.306 --> 02:30.473
DOOFENSHMIRTZ:
Perry the Platypus!

02:30.475 --> 02:34.777
(LAUGHS) It's a bottle
of sparkling cider trap,
and you're the cork.

02:34.779 --> 02:38.214
Which makes you
Perry the Corkapus!

02:38.216 --> 02:39.649
Ha ha, you got
a funny name.

02:39.651 --> 02:41.484
Anyway, it's
New Year's themed.

02:41.486 --> 02:43.686
Happy New Year!
Not yet, Norm.

02:43.688 --> 02:47.723
I recently learned
that in most of the world,
there is a tradition

02:47.725 --> 02:51.694
where people decide to change
something about their lives
in the coming year.

02:51.696 --> 02:54.964
And they call it,
a New Year's resolution.

02:54.966 --> 02:58.234
I had no idea.
You see, back in Drusselstein,
change was frowned upon.

02:58.236 --> 02:59.735
Any change.

02:59.737 --> 03:01.337
<i>Uh, you couldn't change</i>
<i>the channel on your TV,</i>

03:01.339 --> 03:03.973
<i>you couldn't change</i>
<i>your underwear.</i>

03:03.975 --> 03:06.976
<i>And forget about changing</i>
<i>your hairstyle. You'd...</i>
<i>You'd end up in jail.</i>

03:06.978 --> 03:10.379
But here in the New World,
we embrace change!

03:10.381 --> 03:16.319
Apparently. And that's
why I came up with the
Resolution-Changer-inator!

03:16.321 --> 03:18.221
Cleverly disguised
as a bow tie.

03:18.223 --> 03:20.389
When I turn it on
at the stroke of midnight,

03:20.391 --> 03:23.559
it will make everyone
change their resolution
from whatever it was,

03:23.561 --> 03:27.129
like, uh, you know,
"I'm gonna lose weight,"
or "Gain a limb" or whatever,

03:27.131 --> 03:30.433
to "I'm going to make
Heinz Doofenshmirtz my leader

03:30.435 --> 03:32.668
"and obey his every command!"

03:32.670 --> 03:34.570
That will be
their new resolution.

03:34.572 --> 03:35.838
All right, Norm,
how do I look?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.707
Like a pharmacist
in a bow tie!

03:37.709 --> 03:41.010
Eh, good enough.
Time to go.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.478
DOOFENSHMIRTZ:
You're squandering, Norm.

03:44.348 --> 03:46.048
Ready to get
your party on, dear?

03:46.050 --> 03:48.284
Do one-legged ducks
swim in circles?

03:48.286 --> 03:50.486
Wow! First year
with the adults!

03:50.488 --> 03:52.054
Yep. We're all
grown up now.

03:52.056 --> 03:55.358
No more pig tails, dollies,
or obsessing over boys.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.227
From now on,
we obsess over men.
(BOTH GIGGLE)

03:58.229 --> 04:00.263
And no more busting!
Atta girl!

04:00.265 --> 04:03.232
Yep, I'm sticking
to my resolution and
turning over a new leaf.

04:03.234 --> 04:06.168
Fifteen whole minutes,
and I haven't thought
of Phineas and Ferb.

04:06.170 --> 04:10.139
How they make those things.
You know, those big, like,
dangerous things they make...

04:10.141 --> 04:12.742
Candace.
Sorry! I'm back,
I'm back.

04:12.744 --> 04:14.343
Resolution kicking in.

04:14.345 --> 04:16.712
Oh, look,
here come the boys!
You mean men?

04:16.714 --> 04:18.681
(BOTH GIGGLE)
Ladies.

04:18.683 --> 04:20.349
That's us.
We're ladies.

04:24.721 --> 04:26.789
Carbonation is fun!

04:26.791 --> 04:28.391
(PARTY MUSIC PLAYING)

04:28.393 --> 04:30.726
Hello, Danville!
Hey, you there.

04:30.728 --> 04:32.695
What's your
New Year's resolution?

04:32.697 --> 04:34.230
To update my mustache.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.866
That's what you
think! (LAUGHS)

04:36.868 --> 04:39.201
I don't know,
it seemed achievable.

04:39.203 --> 04:41.170
This is so great,
being here as an adult.

04:41.172 --> 04:43.639
(CHUCKLES)
Not like my brothers,
who are kids,

04:43.641 --> 04:45.608
who are,
who are probably
building something...

04:45.610 --> 04:46.742
Candace.
...something big.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.611
Candace.
Big and bustable.

04:48.613 --> 04:50.546
Gotta go!
Oh, no, you don't.

04:50.548 --> 04:53.115
This is gonna be
a new year with
a new Candace, remember?

04:53.117 --> 04:56.419
Gotta bust... (STUTTERS)
Gotta... Gotta... Bust...

04:56.421 --> 04:58.754
It's okay, it's just
a temporary relapse.
(MUMBLES)

04:58.756 --> 05:02.191
Candace,
Stacy told me about your
New Year's resolution.

05:02.193 --> 05:05.194
I... I need a time out.
I'll be right back.

05:05.196 --> 05:07.296
Relapse?
Relapse.

05:07.298 --> 05:10.633
That's what you think.
(LAUGHING)

05:10.635 --> 05:13.502

It doesn't really specify

05:26.884 --> 05:28.451
so I guess you're okay.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.886
Oh, another little tidbit
about the ancient Egyptians

05:30.888 --> 05:33.155
is that both men
and women wore make up.

05:33.157 --> 05:34.724
Just like the '80s.

05:34.726 --> 05:37.360
(SPUTTERS)
Hold it together, girl.
You can do this.

05:37.362 --> 05:39.428
Hey, I thought your
New Year's resolution

05:39.430 --> 05:42.231
was to stop eating
sandwiches in the bathroom.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.333
But it's not midnight yet,
so I can still enjoy this.

05:44.335 --> 05:46.202
"Not midnight yet?"
That's it!

05:46.204 --> 05:49.271
I've actually got
an hour left to bust
my brothers!

05:49.273 --> 05:51.207

what they're doing.

actually paid off.

it feel to be a loser,

I mean, that's
a rhetorical question.

should know how it feels,
it should be me, right?

no one ever keeps their
