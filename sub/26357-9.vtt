11:40.267 --> 11:42.770
(reading in Hebrew)

11:48.108 --> 11:49.843
(groans)

11:49.877 --> 11:52.112
Come on, sweetie,
pick up the pace.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.214
The sushi's been sitting out
for an hour.

11:54.247 --> 11:58.118
When Willie turned 13, it was
time to work in the mines.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.552
It's go time.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.955
(wheezing)

12:01.989 --> 12:04.291
Help. My friend's having
an asthma attack.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.795
Not yet, Bart.
This is a real one.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.229
-(grunts)
-Even better.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.799
(wheezing)

12:11.832 --> 12:14.101
Please, we've got to get him
to the hospital.

12:14.134 --> 12:17.938
Wow. I'm gonna meet a nurse.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.973
(bicycle bell rings)

12:20.007 --> 12:22.075
(Shauna reading in Hebrew)

12:25.012 --> 12:29.316
And now we're gonna party
like it's 5799.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.151
Wait, wait, wait.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.487
Before you leave,
I am going to talk.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.958
And I'm going to tell you
a very long joke.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.793
Please stand.

12:39.827 --> 12:44.965
So, an old rabbi was
confronted with squirrels

12:44.998 --> 12:46.299
in the attic.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.969
Get to the punch line
or your son flunks geometry.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.303
He gave the squirrels
a bar mitzvah

12:50.337 --> 12:51.404
and never saw them
in temple again.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.772
Amen.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.310
(angry chatter)

12:57.344 --> 12:59.179
I don't drive a minivan.

12:59.212 --> 13:02.482
Do I look like a suburban
soccer mom from Phoenix?

13:02.515 --> 13:04.918
Well, sometimes,
when you're tired.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.854
-Shut up!
-I should be first.

13:06.887 --> 13:07.855
I own a Tesla.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.256
Those are my keys.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.458
Prepare for the boning
of your life.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.960
(grunts)

13:12.993 --> 13:15.328
(shouting)

13:17.064 --> 13:20.200
To repeat, I own a Tesla,
and I'm going to use "summon."

13:23.136 --> 13:24.872
(all gasp)

13:24.905 --> 13:28.808
Who is responsible
for this meshugana behavior?

13:28.842 --> 13:31.144
-He did it.
-(gasps)

13:47.494 --> 13:48.929
Oh...

13:51.264 --> 13:52.799
Hey, Mr. Cunningham.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.002
I said hey, Mr. Cunningham.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.636
I didn't do it.
Nobody saw me do it.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.072
They know I did it.
Protect me, Dad.

13:59.106 --> 14:02.075
SCOUT (on TV): Don't you
remember me, Mr. Cunningham?

14:02.109 --> 14:03.743
I'm Jean Louise Finch.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.416
(shouting)

14:11.418 --> 14:12.652
Where's your boy?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.487
(Southern accent):
What's your hurry, friend?

14:14.521 --> 14:17.724
Now, Homer, don't you try
to disarm us

14:17.757 --> 14:21.995
with your genteel mannerisms
of a bygone era there.

14:22.029 --> 14:26.066
Why, I haven't a notion
as to what you are importuning,

14:26.099 --> 14:27.100
good sir.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.801
(angry chatter)

14:37.877 --> 14:39.512
(gunshot)

14:39.546 --> 14:41.514
(Southern accent):
Excuse me, Mr. Szyslak.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.251
Mr. Szyslak, we know you.

14:44.284 --> 14:47.087
My father likes to drink
at your bar.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.456
You can't say hi to me?

14:49.489 --> 14:51.058
(sobbing)

14:51.091 --> 14:53.260
And how 'bout you, Chief Wiggum?

14:53.293 --> 14:55.595
I go to school
with your boy, Ralph.

14:55.628 --> 14:59.099
Give my regards to Ralph,
would you, please?

14:59.132 --> 15:01.434
All right, let's go, people.
They've defused us.

15:01.468 --> 15:04.071
Everyone get, uh,
get one last mutter in.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.439
(all muttering)

15:08.241 --> 15:11.044
Oh, Lisa, sweetie, you saved me.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.213
No, Dad, you saved us all

15:13.246 --> 15:15.382
with your calmness and bravery.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.985
-Thanks. Just one thing.
-Yes, Dad?

15:18.018 --> 15:19.819
Don't tell your mother
about the mob

15:19.852 --> 15:21.054
that almost killed your brother.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.090
She's taken a liking to him.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.224
MARGE:
The what?

15:24.257 --> 15:27.060
You're hearing things
in the shower again, Marge.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.762
Oh, okay.

15:29.796 --> 15:30.863
-(gunshot)
-WIGGUM: Sorry.

15:37.104 --> 15:40.974
Okay, Maggie,
you give me your binky,

15:41.008 --> 15:45.112
and I'll give you this
substitution bear doll.

15:48.881 --> 15:51.018
You can't beat addiction, Marge.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.186
I got addicted
to Agatha Christie books.

15:53.220 --> 15:57.157
I always thought the murderer
was that know-it-all Belgian.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.526
Turns out, he was the detective.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.929
41 books, and I never
saw it coming.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.931
-(Lisa groans)
-(gasps)

16:04.964 --> 16:07.300
-What happened?
-Got in a fight.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.502
Why? What did the other kid do?

16:09.536 --> 16:12.105
Said Dad was lazy
and incompetent.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.706
And where is this other kid?

16:13.740 --> 16:14.974
-Yo.
-(gasps)

16:15.008 --> 16:16.843
You got in a fight
with your brother?

16:16.876 --> 16:18.678
I won a fight with my brother.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.213
-Liar.
-Let's go again.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.182
Stop her, Mom.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.784
(Marge groans)

16:24.817 --> 16:26.219
To combat bed-wetting,
doctors recommend

16:26.253 --> 16:27.720
shifting times for drinking,
scheduling bathroom breaks,

16:27.754 --> 16:30.057
and being encouraging.
I'll deny having said this,

16:30.090 --> 16:31.524
but the next time you wet
your bed, have 'em spank you.

16:31.558 --> 16:34.127
-Next.
-(timer dings)

16:34.161 --> 16:35.695
Wait, you're not a kid.
Doesn't matter.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.164
You've got 45 seconds. Go.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.632
I'm worried that my daughter
is ruining her family

16:39.666 --> 16:41.701
idolizing her father.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.670
I see. Wow. Marge,
it's totally normal

16:43.703 --> 16:45.472
for a little girl to be
infatuated with her father.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.174
It's safe and comes
from a good place,

16:47.207 --> 16:48.875
and when it ends, it's another
thing she'll blame you for.

16:48.908 --> 16:51.644
Yes, well, I'm afraid
my husband isn't always

16:51.678 --> 16:54.147
a perfect influence.

16:54.181 --> 16:57.084
Marge, I've got a legal matter
to deal with.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.052
I'll be outside.

17:01.221 --> 17:04.157
Also, I'm worried that my son
is feeling neglected.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.592
Your husband has to give your
daughter the perfect speech,

17:05.625 --> 17:07.660
which lets her down
but doesn't snap her in two.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.028
And make sure you don't
have any more kids.

17:09.062 --> 17:11.264
Sounds like it'll be a disaster.

17:11.298 --> 17:14.101
Whoa, nice to meet you.
See you in three years.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.034
-(timer dings)
-Now, good-bye.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.574
-Homer?
-Huh? What?

17:21.608 --> 17:24.177
Homer, it's sweet that
Lisa idolizes you,

17:24.211 --> 17:26.513
but I think it's gone too far.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.047
You're right.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.216
Tell her she's right.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.417
I just did.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.519
I'm on a five-second delay.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.721
The kids are at
each other's throats.

17:34.754 --> 17:38.125
Look, you can't be my dog
and hers; pick a side.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.761
You can't hide in there forever.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.197
-(toots)
-(barking)

17:44.231 --> 17:46.966
Okay, I'll talk to Bart,
you talk to Lisa.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.102
We've got to put this family
back in place.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.538
Okay. Why do you
always tell me

17:51.571 --> 17:55.041
the most important things just
when I'm about to fall asleep?

17:55.074 --> 17:58.478
Because I think the pillow talk
between a woman and her husband

17:58.511 --> 18:01.914
is the most important...

18:01.948 --> 18:03.983
What? How did I
wind up in church?

18:07.154 --> 18:08.455
What's wrong, sweetie?

18:08.488 --> 18:10.990
I've got that terrible feeling
where I'm almost

18:11.023 --> 18:12.459
at the end of a great book,

18:12.492 --> 18:15.662
and once I finish,
it's over forever.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.265
Well, that's kind of what
I wanted to talk to you about.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.601
You and I have had a lot of fun
these past few weeks,

18:21.634 --> 18:23.736
but you aren't always gonna
look up to your dad

18:23.770 --> 18:25.104
as much as you do now.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.906
Bup, bup, bup.
Great man,

18:26.939 --> 18:29.942
there is nothing you could do
to make me lose one iota

18:29.976 --> 18:32.179
of respect for you.

18:32.212 --> 18:35.348
♪

18:35.382 --> 18:38.585
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be that guy,

18:38.618 --> 18:40.920
but now I can't fit
behind a door.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.090
You'll discover I'm not
the perfect man you think.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.025
Okay, I'll finish my book.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.628
But always remember
you're my dad,

18:48.661 --> 18:51.831
and I'll never forget
the way you and...

18:53.733 --> 18:55.202
Damn it.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.506
I'm home!

18:59.539 --> 19:00.673
(sighs)

19:00.707 --> 19:03.142
She's moved on,

19:03.176 --> 19:05.812
which, let's face it,
is the way things should be.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.814
Kids grow up, daddies die,

19:07.847 --> 19:09.982
and then the wind
whispers, "Why?"

19:12.018 --> 19:14.387
Oh, I don't know.
I've been hurt before.

19:14.421 --> 19:17.023
I don't want to mess you up
by getting close to you.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.165
Aw.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.869
No problem.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.170
Marge, get in here.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.076
Okay, Bart, because
we treasure you, too,

19:37.109 --> 19:40.179
I'm gonna let you do one thing
just for yourself.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.681
Kick Homer in the butt?

19:41.714 --> 19:45.084
Uh, why don't you
give it some thought.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.152
Kick Lisa in the butt.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.754
Have a birthday party every day?

19:47.787 --> 19:49.722
Never brush my teeth again.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.258
Be homeschooled by the dog.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.092
Drive a tank through
Skinner's house.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.994
Open a casino in the basement.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.162
Have an affair?

19:56.195 --> 19:59.098
-You haven't decided yet?
-Don't rush me.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.668
Convert my Roth IRA to a 401K?

20:01.701 --> 20:02.935
Have an affair?

20:02.969 --> 20:04.103
Take a mulligan?

20:04.136 --> 20:05.572
Okay, I've decided.

20:05.605 --> 20:08.174
I'll kick Homer in the butt.

20:08.207 --> 20:12.245
You can kick it
