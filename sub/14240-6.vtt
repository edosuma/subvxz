WEBVTT

00:02.291 --> 00:07.775
Torchwood. Outside the government,
beyond the police.

00:07.765 --> 00:10.723
Fighting for the future
on behalf of the human race.

00:10.722 --> 00:14.681
The 21st century

00:14.675 --> 00:16.996

01:15.850 --> 01:18.011
WEEVIL ROARS

01:24.045 --> 01:25.569
He's dead.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.439
BELLJANGLES

01:33.392 --> 01:36.350
Sorry, we're closing.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.314
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:45.820 --> 01:50.052
Documents on the body identify
the victim as Meredith Roberts.

01:50.052 --> 01:53.294
No obvious signs of violence.
Are we saying it wasn't the Weevil?

01:53.288 --> 01:57.975
Give me a chance, Miss Cooper.
I've only just started.
'Jack, your VIP visitor is here.'

01:57.966 --> 02:00.287
I didn't realise
we were having a visitor.

02:00.282 --> 02:05.322
Suddenly, in an underground
mortuary, on a wet night in Cardiff,
I hear the song of a nightingale.

02:09.274 --> 02:11.640
Miss Martha Jones.

02:25.773 --> 02:27.695
Oh, it's good to see you, Jack.

02:29.571 --> 02:33.291
Toshiko, Owen, Gwen,

02:33.288 --> 02:36.166
Ianto, meet Martha.

02:36.164 --> 02:38.166
Just a casual visit or. . . ?

02:38.161 --> 02:40.561
I'm here to complete your postmortem.

02:40.559 --> 02:42.686
Dr Jones is from UNIT.

02:42.678 --> 02:46.921
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry, I get
a bit confused. Which one's UNIT?

02:46.912 --> 02:49.403
Intelligence, military,
cute red caps.

02:49.393 --> 02:53.079
The acceptable face of
intelligence gathering on aliens.

02:53.070 --> 02:56.426
We're more ad hoc.
But better looking.

02:56.423 --> 03:00.143
I identified a pattern
from UNIT's data on sudden deaths.

03:00.141 --> 03:05.659
Toxic shock. Nothing to link
the victims. Different ages, sexes,
ethnic origins, occupations.

03:05.652 --> 03:09.656
But there was
a statistically significant
concentration in South Wales.

03:09.649 --> 03:13.403
Come on, Martha, be honest. You
just came all this way to see me.

03:13.403 --> 03:16.531
Still struggling to conquer
your shyness, Jack?

03:16.523 --> 03:20.596
So what about this pattern,
then, Dr Jones?

03:20.596 --> 03:24.202
They were being written off
as suicides or accidents.

03:24.195 --> 03:26.277
Look.

03:27.311 --> 03:29.916
Puncture mark.

03:29.907 --> 03:34.867
Hypodermic needle.
You'll find his bloodstream was
pumped full of ammonium hydroxide.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.788
Bloodstream.
I was going to do that next.

03:36.782 --> 03:39.501
Have you checked his medical records?
No. I wasjust about to.

03:39.499 --> 03:43.697
Let's give it a go. You never know,
Owen, you might learn something.

03:46.131 --> 03:49.851
One Meredith Roberts, age 45.

03:49.845 --> 03:53.326
I know there's been a major crash
on the NHS system.

03:53.321 --> 03:55.528
Wiped a shedload of files.

03:55.519 --> 04:00.081
Including all the victims I flagged
up from the UNIT data. And now yours.

04:00.075 --> 04:03.636
A computer crash wouldn't delete
data so cleanly. This is deliberate.

04:03.632 --> 04:05.190
Let me look into it.

04:05.189 --> 04:07.987
How's the family? Getting better.

04:07.987 --> 04:10.387
They send their love. Give them mine.

04:10.387 --> 04:15.108
So, End of the World Survivors Club.

04:15.100 --> 04:17.216
God, I am so glad to see you, Jack!

04:17.214 --> 04:20.503
See, you did come all this way
just to see me. It's the jaw line.

04:20.492 --> 04:22.175
Once seen, always yearned for.

04:27.607 --> 04:29.245
D'you miss him?

04:29.243 --> 04:33.088
No. I made my choice.

04:33.080 --> 04:37.198
Maybe sometimes. Ah!
Tiny bit. Tiny, tiny.

04:37.197 --> 04:40.598
Then I come to my senses again.
Anyway, I've got plenty to occupy me.

04:40.594 --> 04:43.961
Oh, yeah, Miss Highfalutin'.
What is it? Medical officer?

04:43.951 --> 04:45.634
Oh, yes.

04:45.628 --> 04:51.225
So do I have to call you ma'am? No.
Just follow my orders to the letter.

04:52.264 --> 04:55.461
You should have called me
if you were looking for a job.

04:55.457 --> 05:00.690
I wasn't. This woman from UNIT
rang out of the blue,
said I was just what they needed,

05:00.690 --> 05:03.773
that I'd come highly recommended
by an impeccable source.

05:03.767 --> 05:06.611
You mean. . . ?
Well, who else would have done it?

05:07.684 --> 05:10.608
He must have thought
he owed you a favour.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.491
Guess we all do.

05:16.476 --> 05:19.877
Do you think you could get me one of
those white caps for personal use?

05:19.873 --> 05:21.670
Ianto might look good in it.

05:21.670 --> 05:25.310
You want uniforms, get your own. Now,
am I going to get the guided tour?

05:25.304 --> 05:27.511
Yes, ma'am, whatever you say, ma'am!

05:27.504 --> 05:29.062
Huah! Leave it!

05:29.060 --> 05:32.382
So that's the hot house. Tour
continues this way, ladies, please.

05:32.375 --> 05:36.698
No dawdling. Um, so,
you know Jack pretty well, then?

05:36.692 --> 05:41.208
Oh, we were only together
for. . .a few days.

05:41.206 --> 05:42.935
But it was pretty intense.

05:44.283 --> 05:48.447
You mean. . . ? Oh, God, no!
No, not that sort of intense.

05:48.441 --> 05:50.682
Nothing like that.

05:50.676 --> 05:54.157
Why? Are you and him. . . ?
No, no, not at all.

05:54.157 --> 05:57.001
We must be the only two people
on the planet.

05:56.991 --> 05:58.629
I know. What are we doing wrong?

06:00.669 --> 06:04.036
Oi, you talking about me?

06:04.025 --> 06:07.938
No, no, we were just discussing
alien flora, weren't we? Oh, yeah.

06:07.937 --> 06:11.100
She's no fun.
Raise your game, girls!

06:12.774 --> 06:15.891
You've got some well weird kit.
What's this?

06:15.890 --> 06:17.733
Be careful. It's an alien artefact.

06:17.727 --> 06:19.570
There's a lot of argument
about this.

06:19.564 --> 06:22.852
But for my money, it's got to be
a surgical instrument. Really?

06:22.845 --> 06:24.847
He's guessing. Typical medic. Hmm.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.049
Well,
I call it a singularity scalpel.

06:27.038 --> 06:33.398
See, what it does is concentrates
energy on a tiny fixed point without
damaging anything on the way.

06:33.393 --> 06:38.547
It's brilliant. It's amazing. Yeah,
do you remember the last time
you did that, Owen. . . ? Yes.

06:38.547 --> 06:42.665
Right, now,
all we're going to do is,
we're going to vaporise this paper

06:42.664 --> 06:45.986
without even scorching the cup.

06:45.978 --> 06:48.219
This is going to end in tears.

06:48.214 --> 06:49.738
OK.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.045
Aagh!

07:05.837 --> 07:08.442
Er, haven't quite got
the calibration right yet.

07:12.031 --> 07:15.671
Jack, there's been another attack.
Assault with a hypodermic.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.795
Only this time, the victim survived.

07:17.785 --> 07:20.310
Woman, aged 27.
She's in the hospital.

07:20.303 --> 07:23.181
Medical records wiped,
just like the others.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.295
Yeah, but the doctors
said they'd finished with me.

07:31.290 --> 07:34.327
We're a bit different.
We know this is tough on you, Marie.

07:34.328 --> 07:37.013
But did you recognise
the man who attacked you?

07:37.005 --> 07:41.362
I already told the police.
We're different from them, too.
No, I never seen him before.

07:41.359 --> 07:44.647
Did he say anything
in the course of the attack? No.

07:44.636 --> 07:46.558
Open wide.

07:46.552 --> 07:50.636
Look, he just,
he came towards me with a great
big bloody needle, didn't he?

07:50.629 --> 07:54.952
You know, my dog bit him and then
I kicked him in the nuts. Respect!

07:57.464 --> 07:59.739
MUSIC: "Feel Good Inc" by Gorillaz

08:12.566 --> 08:14.056
This is a. . .three four.

08:25.631 --> 08:28.282
So you and Jack go back a long way?

08:28.271 --> 08:31.229
Forward and back, really.

08:31.228 --> 08:33.991
What brought you together?

08:33.986 --> 08:36.943
Let's say we were
under the same doctor.

08:39.096 --> 08:43.533
These killings -
why the ammonium hydroxide?
It's a weird way to kill someone.

08:43.530 --> 08:46.738
Yeah, it's gross. It's like
injecting them with bleach.

08:48.127 --> 08:50.413
Unless the objective
isn't just killing.

08:50.404 --> 08:53.771
It's destroying something
in the victim's bloodstream.

08:53.762 --> 08:56.560
It's getting rid of evidence!

08:56.558 --> 09:00.005
Locally, we've got a murder victim
and a survivor.

08:59.995 --> 09:03.761
Both attacked with hypodermics, both
with their medical records wiped.

09:03.753 --> 09:05.232
And more cases across the UK.

09:05.230 --> 09:08.757
We think the point of the attacks
is to destroy evidence
of their medical condition.

09:08.747 --> 09:12.183
Gwen, Ianto, pursue
the criminal investigation. OK.

09:12.181 --> 09:14.502
Martha, Owen will follow up
with the medical side. Fine.

09:14.498 --> 09:17.376
Tosh, any luck in retrieving
those medical records? Not yet.

09:17.375 --> 09:20.094
I'm gonna have to dig down
into the system memories,

09:20.092 --> 09:23.095
see if I can find any remnants
of deleted or temporary files.

09:23.090 --> 09:25.217
Completely illegally, of course.

09:25.209 --> 09:28.770
Do what you have to.
We're not dealing with a freak
with some needle fetish.

09:28.766 --> 09:30.529
This is a conspiracy.

09:30.523 --> 09:33.924
Ianto, the police have found
another body in Heath Park.

09:33.919 --> 09:37.127
It's got all the hallmarks
of the other attacks.

09:37.117 --> 09:39.756
I'll get Gwen, head out there now.

09:51.819 --> 09:53.423
What have you got?

09:53.416 --> 09:57.295
Body was found early this morning.
Caucasian male, early 20s.
OK, thanks.

10:01.448 --> 10:04.372
Who is he? Barry Leonard. Student.

10:04.367 --> 10:07.165
Doctor said it looked like. . .
Toxic shock.

10:11.638 --> 10:15.836
The attack took place in the woods,
so no witnesses, no CCTV.

10:15.835 --> 10:17.234
Same as the others.

10:17.233 --> 10:21.317
Yeah. Tosh just checked Barry's
medical records - already wiped.

10:21.310 --> 10:24.837
The puncture mark on his eyeball was
identical to the other victims.

10:24.827 --> 10:26.135
I mean, Jack's right.

10:26.135 --> 10:30.105
These attacks are not random,
they're clinical. Professional.

10:30.098 --> 10:31.781
More like assassinations.

10:31.775 --> 10:35.495
Except Barry Leonard was a student.
Who'd assassinate a student?

10:35.491 --> 10:39.257
Student Loans Company. Yeah, yeah,
I think you've just cracked it.

10:39.250 --> 10:41.810
But why delete medical records?

10:41.806 --> 10:46.891
You know, what did all these people
have in common? Owen's analysing
Marie's test results now.

10:46.883 --> 10:51.081
So we've got no idea where the
killer will strike next and the
attacks are getting more frequent.

10:51.076 --> 10:53.840
We keep looking, Gwen,
we'll find something.

10:53.835 --> 10:55.632
'Martha, call from the hospital.

10:55.631 --> 10:57.792
'Marie's had some sort of seizure.'

10:57.791 --> 11:00.191
They want us at the hospital.
Marie's collapsed.

11:00.188 --> 11:03.635
Yeah? My money's on this stuff. From
Marie's blood. It's a new one on me.

11:03.625 --> 11:07.300
Yeah, me too. Have you run
an isoenzyme analysis on it?

11:07.297 --> 11:10.539
No, not yet. What are you thinking?
Parasitic infection? Could be.

11:10.536 --> 11:14.529
It's got to be down to this stuff,
or I haven't got a clue
what's wrong with her.

11:14.530 --> 11:17.454
Yeah - no infections,
no deficiencies in organ function,

11:17.448 --> 11:23.603
perfect cholesterol levels,
ideal blood pressure. Yeah, exactly.
She's so normal, she's abnormal.

11:23.601 --> 11:26.729
Marie? Marie, can you hear me?

11:26.719 --> 11:28.198
Mmm, yeah.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.678
OK, you've got something
in your blood that
we don't recognise, all right?

11:33.672 --> 11:35.754
We think it's behind
your current illness

11:35.750 --> 11:39.151
and we need to know what's been
happening to you so we can help you.

11:39.147 --> 11:41.388
Well, you're the doctors.
You tell me.

11:44.658 --> 11:49.220
'Barry was my best mate.
We were doing the same course.'

11:49.215 --> 11:50.864
Met him on the first day.

11:50.855 --> 11:53.858
Was Barry doing
any sort of drugs at all?

11:53.849 --> 11:56.329
Well, he used to be really clean.

11:56.326 --> 12:00.808
Reckoned he had to be careful
about what went into his body
because of his diabetes.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.043
Barry was diabetic?

12:02.043 --> 12:06.639
Sure. But when they cured that,
he was doing booze, blow. . .

12:06.636 --> 12:10.481
Wait a minute. You're telling me
Barry's diabetes was cured? Sure.

12:10.471 --> 12:14.430
That's impossible. Well, he stopped
taking insulin. He was fine.

12:14.428 --> 12:18.706
Owen, something you should know.
So who performed this miracle cure?

12:18.702 --> 12:20.340
He was very quiet about that.

12:20.339 --> 12:23.297
All I know is, he was suddenly
flashing a load of wedge about.

12:23.296 --> 12:27.335
Barry Leonard is said to
have recovered from diabetes.

12:27.334 --> 12:29.370
Thanks, Ianto.

12:29.370 --> 12:32.214
Listen, Marie,
you're gonna have to level with us.

12:32.208 --> 12:36.895
This could be a matter of
life and death. Have you ever
had a serious medical condition?

12:36.885 --> 12:38.682
Too good to be true.

12:38.681 --> 12:40.683
What do you mean?

12:40.679 --> 12:43.489
I had HIV.

12:43.479 --> 12:47.279
You're perfectly clear of antibodies.
That's not medically possible.

12:47.273 --> 12:51.198
That's the Reset. Reset?
What are we talking about? A drug?

12:51.194 --> 12:54.755
Right, I'm not familiar with Reset,
so any idea of a chemical name?

13:01.695 --> 13:04.539
Where d'you get it from, Marie?
I got it from the Pharm. The farm?

13:04.535 --> 13:08.130
What farm?
No, P-H-A-R-M, the Pharm.

13:08.128 --> 13:10.813
It's a medical research place,
all right?

13:10.806 --> 13:13.286
How did you get it from there?
They gave it to me.

13:13.286 --> 13:18.201
They paid me a lot of money. They
said I should to keep quiet about
it cos it was part of the contract.

13:18.199 --> 13:21.282
Are you saying you were
a clinical trial subject?

13:21.277 --> 13:23.643
Marie? Convulsing. Marie!

13:23.634 --> 13:26.432
I'll give her another 10ml.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.513
You're all right.

13:33.141 --> 13:36.065
MONITOR FLATLINES

13:39.296 --> 13:41.184
She's dead.

13:45.810 --> 13:48.768
BUZZING

13:51.164 --> 13:54.201
Emergency! Get us out of here!

13:54.201 --> 13:58.126
BUZZING INCREASES

14:08.790 --> 14:11.782
So it's an alien larva,
incubating in human bodies.

14:11.781 --> 14:13.499
We've never seen anything like it.

14:13.498 --> 14:15.819
So it left Marie's body
when she died,

14:15.818 --> 14:18.855
looking for another host
for its next stage of development.

14:18.855 --> 14:21.062
Which could have been us. Yeah.

14:21.052 --> 14:24.374
Fortunately, when they didn't
find one quickly, they died.

14:24.369 --> 14:27.054
I wonder what this cute
little larva grows up to be?

14:28.563 --> 14:32.249
This, folks, is a molecular model
of the drug that
we found in Marie's blood.

14:32.761 --> 14:34.717
She called it Reset.
So what does it do?

14:34.717 --> 14:38.323
Think about when you run a virus
scan through your computer, yeah?

14:38.313 --> 14:41.111
The software works its way through
the files and when it finds

14:41.112 --> 14:44.639
a Trojan or a virus or whatever,
identifies it and then deletes it.

14:44.628 --> 14:47.392
That is what this stuff does
to the human body.

14:47.382 --> 14:52.024
But it's not just viruses.
It's harmful bacteria, toxins,
even mutant cells, you name it.

14:52.020 --> 14:55.057
It's like the body's been turned
back to its factory settings.

14:55.056 --> 14:56.853
It's the ultimate magic bullet.

14:56.853 --> 15:00.095
Supersedes anything and everything
in the pharmacological armoury.

15:00.091 --> 15:03.891
That would be the greatest medical
discovery in history. Exactly.

15:03.886 --> 15:07.322
Except, it comes bundled
with a lethal alien parasite.

15:07.322 --> 15:09.927
Ah, not so good a discovery.

15:09.922 --> 15:12.686
The parasite needs a healthy body
until it's incubated.

15:12.678 --> 15:15.920
So the parasite egg
incorporates this magic bullet,

15:15.916 --> 15:19.955
which puts everything in the system
back to its factory settings. Reset.

15:19.950 --> 15:21.474
Neato.

15:21.470 --> 15:26.146
So who runs the Pharm? Well,
the public image is innocent enough.

15:26.141 --> 15:30.749
Private-public partnership between
the government and a consortium
of the pharmaceutical companies.

15:30.738 --> 15:33.775
Researching and developing
cutting-edge biotechnology.

15:33.774 --> 15:37.062
Their IT systems are way more
cutting-edge than they need to be.

15:37.051 --> 15:40.726
Plus, they've got seemingly
unrestricted security clearance.

15:40.726 --> 15:44.969
Which means they'd have
the capability to erase
medical records if they wanted to.

15:44.962 --> 15:46.441
Exactly. Who runs this outfit?

15:46.440 --> 15:50.285
Institute director is a Dr Aaron
Copley. Yeah, I know his work.

15:50.277 --> 15:53.917
He's one of the most respected
research scientists in his field.

15:53.914 --> 15:56.075
Harvard graduate.
Did research at Cambridge.

15:56.072 --> 15:59.155
Last job, Harvard Professor
of Molecular Pharmacology.

15:59.148 --> 16:01.116
Came to the UK to set up the Pharm.

16:01.108 --> 16:02.985
Hmm, he's kinda handsome, too.

16:02.982 --> 16:04.904
D'you think he'll like visitors?

16:13.890 --> 16:16.336
Torchwood.

16:25.439 --> 16:30.126
Sorry you've had
a wasted journey, Mr. . .Harker.

16:30.116 --> 16:32.801
Harkness. And it's Captain,
but you can call me Jack.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.477
Captain?
Where did you park your boat?

16:37.344 --> 16:39.187
I like a man with a sense of humour.

16:39.184 --> 16:41.470
Know any good gags
about clinical trials?

16:41.461 --> 16:45.386
Well, Jack, none of these faces
mean anything to me.

16:45.378 --> 16:51.214
And as the institute director,
I would have met them personally,
had they been our trial subjects.

16:51.212 --> 16:54.932
Dr Copley. . . Professor, actually.

16:56.966 --> 16:59.730
But I can call you Aaron, right?

16:59.723 --> 17:02.760
See, this is a little awkward.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.523
Two of these people were murdered.

17:05.517 --> 17:08.441
Another died of a parasitic
infection of alien origin

17:08.434 --> 17:11.915
and one of the victims mentioned
your organisation's name

17:11.912 --> 17:16.076
shortly before she died.
Alien origin? That's preposterous.

17:16.066 --> 17:20.150
Er, Professor,
when I was writing my MD thesis,

17:20.138 --> 17:24.337
your published works on immunology
were very helpful, so thank you.

17:24.337 --> 17:26.020
Glad to be of service.

17:26.017 --> 17:30.056
Now, if there was a drug
that could restore the human body

17:30.050 --> 17:33.770
back to its factory settings,
as it were, you would know about it.

17:33.768 --> 17:35.326
You're right, I would.

17:35.324 --> 17:38.487
But nothing like that exists.

17:38.482 --> 17:41.849
I had a boyfriend whose
nostrils flared when HE was lying.

17:45.236 --> 17:48.433
I'm already late
for my next appointment.

17:48.432 --> 17:50.593
You go ahead.
We'll have a look around.

17:50.589 --> 17:53.831
Well, obviously our research suites
are classified,

17:53.824 --> 17:57.749
so we can't grant you access
to those, but we'd be delighted
to give you the PR tour.

17:57.741 --> 18:00.141
Normally, Aaron,
we go where we like.

18:00.138 --> 18:02.186
Not here, actually.

18:02.175 --> 18:04.063
Ask Whitehall.

18:04.055 --> 18:05.579
We're fireproof.

18:05.571 --> 18:09.814
Yeah. I had a bad experience
with a politician recently.

18:09.809 --> 18:13.097
I tend not to listen
to Whitehall any more.

18:13.086 --> 18:17.125
Let me get someone to guide you
back to your vehicle.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.088
Was it me,
or was he a little touchy?

18:19.080 --> 18:21.560
Yeah, so much for
the polite approach.

18:21.556 --> 18:23.877
We need to turn this place over.

18:23.874 --> 18:26.001
BEEPING
Oh, yeah.

18:25.991 --> 18:31.509
Cos this place has the highest
concentration of alien life forms
this side of the Rift.

18:33.062 --> 18:35.348
Grey is so not her colour.

18:47.647 --> 18:49.251
I can't hack in there, Jack.

18:49.245 --> 18:53.011
And if I keep trying
a brute-force approach,
they'll know they're under attack.

18:53.005 --> 18:56.441
An alien life form is preying
on humans. I need a way in there.

18:56.438 --> 19:01.717
Tosh, I've got the results of that
research. On the screen now.

19:06.626 --> 19:10.869
Ianto, that's brilliant! They're
in the market for volunteers.

19:10.861 --> 19:14.865
That's understandable,
given their wastage rate.
One of us goes in undercover.

19:14.857 --> 19:18.224
No, we don't know enough about it.
Too many things could go wrong.

19:18.219 --> 19:21.734
Unless you put a medic in there.
Someone who knew what to look for.

19:21.732 --> 19:23.734
Yeah, but I can't do it.
They know me now.

19:23.729 --> 19:27.893
I know it's hard to believe, Owen,
but I wasn't thinking of you.

19:27.886 --> 19:29.922
No way.

19:29.923 --> 19:33.324
Come on, Jack, I've been
in worse places and you know it.

19:44.148 --> 19:45.866
OK.

19:47.862 --> 19:49.500
Jack, can I have a word?

19:49.500 --> 19:53.823
I know you're big buddies
from way back whenever, but you
can't just send her in like this.

19:53.816 --> 19:55.704
Trust me. She's more than capable.

19:55.693 --> 19:58.253
I'd rely on Martha
if the world was ending.

19:58.253 --> 20:00.813
In fact, I did.

20:00.810 --> 20:05.372
OK, these are the plans
for the Pharm's buildings.

20:05.365 --> 20:09.165
From what Jack and Owen saw,
they reckon that the main house

20:09.162 --> 20:12.199
contains Copley's office,
medical research suites

20:12.198 --> 20:16.476
and the accommodation
for the clinical trials subjects.
What about the rear buildings?

20:16.473 --> 20:19.317
Restricted area,
fenced off, armed security.

20:19.313 --> 20:23.431
Jack thinks that's where
the readings of alien life
forms came from. Cool.

20:23.423 --> 20:26.460
But you don't need to go anywhere
near there. Spoilsport.

20:26.461 --> 20:31.262
The first thing you need to do
is get yourself accepted
as a clinical trials subject.

20:31.258 --> 20:36.616
Don't try too hard, don't draw
too much attention to yourself.
Be invisible. I can do that.

20:36.611 --> 20:39.933
Once you're in, we need you to gain
access to the Pharm's IT systems,

20:39.929 --> 20:42.966
close down the system firewalls
and security protocols.

20:42.966 --> 20:47.482
Tosh can gain access to the files
and see what they're up to.
Industrial espionage.

20:47.481 --> 20:53.442
It's very civilised. Once you've
done that, get out. Don't take any
unnecessary risks. Understood. Cool.

20:54.873 --> 21:00.425
So, Jack asked me if I could
get you a UNIT cap to wear.

21:00.426 --> 21:04.226
Did he? Well, red is my colour.

21:04.220 --> 21:08.099
So am I right in thinking
that you and he. . . ?

21:08.100 --> 21:11.740
We. . .dabble.

21:11.732 --> 21:14.417
Yeah? Yeah.

21:14.411 --> 21:17.289
So what's his dabbling like?

21:18.687 --> 21:22.009
Innovative. Really?
Bordering on the avant garde.

21:22.004 --> 21:23.926
Wow.

21:23.921 --> 21:26.685
Oh, yeah.

21:26.679 --> 21:30.399
Huh. So shall we get
your cover story sorted? Absolutely.

21:30.396 --> 21:32.125
Fake ID.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.914
First name Samantha.

21:34.909 --> 21:36.718
Thought the Jones would be safe.

21:36.707 --> 21:39.710
OK. How do I stay in touch?
Communication's very tricky.

21:39.704 --> 21:41.342
The whole place could be wired.

21:41.341 --> 21:44.458
We don't want you chattering away
to us and being overheard.

21:44.458 --> 21:47.621
But I want to monitor you
at all times. So?

21:47.615 --> 21:51.176
I don't need contact lenses.
You need these. OK?

21:54.409 --> 21:59.415
Oh, I'm a camera! As Chris Isherwood
once said to me when we were
cruising the Kurfurstendamm.

21:59.404 --> 22:05.718
And we. . .can. . .text.

22:05.716 --> 22:10.005
Wow! Power comes from the body heat,
so they only work
when you're wearing them.

22:09.994 --> 22:14.272
Yeah, so you have to wear them
everywhere. I'll do some things
with my eyes shut, then.

22:14.265 --> 22:16.551
In an emergency,
we can speak directly to you.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.592
The lens will communicate with
your sensory neuroreceptors.

22:19.583 --> 22:21.266
Bypasses the auditory system.

22:21.260 --> 22:23.501
But can't these signals
be intercepted?

22:23.496 --> 22:27.614
Alien technology. Which exploits
a solution to the EPR paradox.

22:27.614 --> 22:31.095
Oh, quantum entanglement
of remote particles. OK, cool.

22:31.090 --> 22:33.376
Did I mention she was brilliant?

22:34.608 --> 22:40.012
It's standard procedure to take
two blood tests. One of them
will be analysed overnight.

22:40.002 --> 22:44.678
Thank you, Nurse. So tell us
the places you've been to, Samantha.

22:44.677 --> 22:50.115
Well, I had a great time
in North America, France
and Germany, Australia. . .

22:50.111 --> 22:52.067
What about the Third World?

22:52.067 --> 22:54.023
Africa, Latin America?

22:54.023 --> 22:57.470
No, but I'm sure
I'll get round to it.

22:57.461 --> 23:00.498
Travel off the beaten track
can be a bit of a problem for us.

23:00.498 --> 23:04.423
If you had some exotic tropical
disease, there could be unexpected
side effects,

23:04.414 --> 23:07.144
and volunteers' welfare
is our absolute priority.

23:07.134 --> 23:11.935
I don't think there'll be any
problem with that. And I'm very
conscious of health issues.

23:17.124 --> 23:19.001
My mum's a nurse.

23:20.558 --> 23:23.163
This is Professor Copley, Samantha.

23:23.155 --> 23:25.510
Institute director.
Hi, Sam. Nice to meet you.

23:25.508 --> 23:28.397
Tell her to get close to Copley.

23:28.389 --> 23:31.074
I see you're a postgraduate
student at the moment.

23:31.067 --> 23:35.185
- That's right.
- Studying what?
- Creative writing.

23:35.179 --> 23:38.307
So I really need the cash.

23:38.297 --> 23:43.143
I'm sure you'll understand,
Samantha, that we have a lot of
applicants. Tell her not to lose him.

23:43.135 --> 23:45.103
We'll let you know in due course.

23:46.769 --> 23:51.775
- Actually, there's something
I should have told you.
- Oh, yes?

23:53.602 --> 23:56.480
It'll show up in
the test results anyway.

23:58.997 --> 24:01.443
I did have a hepatitis infection.

24:01.437 --> 24:05.112
No, no, no, she's bullshitting.
It's her way in.

24:05.111 --> 24:09.389
I mean, I'm fine now,
but it stays in the blood.

24:09.384 --> 24:12.501
Strictly speaking,
it's incurable, right?

24:12.501 --> 24:15.538
That puts a different
complexion on things.

24:15.539 --> 24:17.495
We could use a
subject with hepatitis.

24:17.495 --> 24:19.975
- Are you available
to start right now?
- Well, sure.

24:19.973 --> 24:21.941
I've brought my overnight things.

24:21.933 --> 24:25.608
Then all we need is your signature
on this confidentiality agreement.

24:25.607 --> 24:28.053
She's in.

24:28.047 --> 24:32.848
As Chris Isherwood also said,
it's not the getting in,
it's the getting out.

24:34.438 --> 24:37.202
- Thank you.
- What sort of drugs
will you want me to take?

24:37.197 --> 24:40.041
We have got various products
at the clinical trials stage.

24:40.032 --> 24:42.830
You'll be given a briefing
once we've finalised the programme,

24:42.828 --> 24:46.867
and of course we won't proceed
unless we have your informed consent.

24:52.020 --> 24:53.783
Come on, Martha.

24:55.374 --> 24:58.025
Let her settle in.
It's gonna be a long night ahead.

25:04.846 --> 25:09.772
You and Martha are getting on well.
Yeah, you know me - Mr Sociable.

25:09.762 --> 25:13.084
She's beautiful. Is she?

25:15.251 --> 25:18.379
You know she is.
Yes, well, fair cop.

25:18.371 --> 25:20.692
And a doctor.

25:20.688 --> 25:23.725
Perfect match.
No, she's only interested in work.

25:23.724 --> 25:27.842
Do you think? Yeah, a bit of
flirting so I'll show her the ropes.

25:27.839 --> 25:32.606
Plus, if I tried anything with her,
I think Jack would have my kneecaps.

25:33.635 --> 25:39.278
What happened
to that, um, pool tournament
you were organising? That?

25:39.269 --> 25:41.749
It was never a tournament.

25:41.747 --> 25:46.423
What was all that about, then?
It was supposed to be a date. Sorry?

25:46.421 --> 25:48.582
I was asking you out on a date.

25:48.578 --> 25:51.183
A date?

25:51.179 --> 25:53.500
You didn't realise? You and me?

25:53.493 --> 25:55.700
Yeah.

25:55.689 --> 26:01.252
I see. And. . .you still want that?
Yeah.

26:01.242 --> 26:03.051
Right.

26:03.042 --> 26:08.048
I just thought if we spent
some time together, an evening. . .

26:08.037 --> 26:09.561
All right.

26:09.555 --> 26:11.955
Sorry?

26:11.955 --> 26:14.162
Just do it. Are you being sarcastic?

26:14.151 --> 26:16.278
No.

26:16.269 --> 26:19.750
You're being polite. You'll stand me
up. I've just said yes, haven't I?

26:19.746 --> 26:22.306
One date, see how it goes,
which might be nowhere.

26:22.302 --> 26:25.510
That's fine. A drink. OK. Yeah.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.866
I'm going to keep
flirting with people, OK?

26:27.856 --> 26:32.213
Just cos of this, doesn't mean
I'm going to stop flirting.
You can be king of flirts. OK.

26:32.210 --> 26:33.689
Right, then.

26:34.728 --> 26:36.013
Yeah.

26:36.008 --> 26:39.603
Good. We should, er. . .
concentrate on Martha.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.166
Yeah.

27:42.659 --> 27:46.572
Tosh, can you get us past this?
Easy peasy.

27:46.572 --> 27:50.451
She just needs to get the
lenses to within the EPR field.

28:48.909 --> 28:51.673
Tosh, can you help her blag her
way into the computer system?

28:51.667 --> 28:56.309
It'll take time to talk
her through it. We don't have time.
I want her out of that office.

28:56.299 --> 29:00.463
Well, if I can get her to give me
remote control of the computer. . .

29:25.150 --> 29:27.755
. .I have control.

29:34.901 --> 29:37.745
The life cycle of the parasite.

29:37.736 --> 29:40.534
They call it the Mayfly. Wow.

29:42.529 --> 29:46.613
We've never seen a species
like that before. It's beautiful.

29:46.606 --> 29:50.372
It's lethal.
But what is Copley doing with them?

29:50.364 --> 29:55.358
Martha, now we've got control,
we can go through all of this here.
Get out of there pronto.

30:02.391 --> 30:06.509
Do you have that code-breaker
software? I'm sending the patch now.
Thank you.

30:18.651 --> 30:22.337
'Break out in Zone A.
All return to Zone A immediately.

30:22.327 --> 30:25.171
'Breakout in Zone A.
Break out in Zone A.'

30:25.165 --> 30:26.928
ALARM RINGS

30:28.801 --> 30:31.486
'All patrols proceed
with extreme caution.

30:31.479 --> 30:34.118
'The escaped creature
is extremely dangerous.'

30:46.862 --> 30:52.107
Jack? I've got the list of the
clinical trials subjects here.

30:52.098 --> 30:54.134
Meredith Roberts,
Marie Thomas, Barry Leonard.

30:54.132 --> 30:55.929
All the murder victims.

30:55.928 --> 30:58.453
Ooh, who's BD?

30:59.526 --> 31:05.681
Executive actions?

31:05.681 --> 31:07.967
The Pharm are running
their own hit man,

31:07.957 --> 31:10.357
which is unusual
for a medical research facility.

31:10.355 --> 31:13.438
Wait, there's a name here
that we haven't seen before.

31:13.433 --> 31:16.834
Elin Morgan? She hasn't been
reported missing or dead.

31:16.829 --> 31:19.115
She soon will be.
Take Ianto and pull her in.

31:19.107 --> 31:21.507
ALARM RINGS

31:36.768 --> 31:38.611
APPROACHING VOICES

31:42.481 --> 31:45.291
'Do not attempt to approach
the creature, is that understood?

31:45.280 --> 31:47.726
'Stun and sedate only,
the creature is highly dangerous.'

31:47.716 --> 31:49.513
Understood. Come on, keep moving!

31:53.231 --> 31:58.669
If the Pharm have their own hit man,
God knows what they're capable of.
Yeah, and I put her in there.

32:02.303 --> 32:05.056
WHISTLE BLOWS

32:05.055 --> 32:07.501
EERIE WARBLING

32:10.889 --> 32:14.973
Shit! What was that? Radiation
surge? We've lost her signal!

32:14.967 --> 32:16.923
Agh! Ah!

32:18.802 --> 32:21.282
EERIE WARBLING CONTINUES

32:28.154 --> 32:30.042
Agh!

32:30.032 --> 32:31.636
There it is!

32:31.628 --> 32:34.472
Call patrol. Creature located.

32:41.817 --> 32:43.899
I can't get her back.

32:43.893 --> 32:47.420
We have to get her out of there.
That place is swamped in security.

32:47.411 --> 32:51.086
If we steam in, we'll be putting her
at risk! We can't leave her there.

32:51.085 --> 32:55.408
If I can't get her signal in 30
minutes, we think of alternatives.
Anything could be happening to her.

32:55.401 --> 32:59.963
Martha can handle herself.
She's been in worse situations
than this. Sure about that?

33:02.315 --> 33:08.311
What's that? Billy Davis' mobile.
He'll be at Elin's flat
in three minutes.

33:26.769 --> 33:29.374
Hands above your head! Up!

33:36.001 --> 33:40.597
Jack, we've got Billy Davis. He
could help get you into the Pharm.

33:42.592 --> 33:47.347
Will you tell this gorilla to
let me go? ! What is going on? !

33:47.348 --> 33:50.988
- Good work.

33:50.986 --> 33:54.228
- You can't treat me like this!
- You lied to us, Samantha.

33:54.218 --> 33:57.699
Can I just explain? I got bored stuck
in that room, so I went for a walk,

33:57.698 --> 34:01.259
and first that thing attacked me,
and then your heavies assaulted me.

34:01.253 --> 34:03.892
You don't owe any
loyalty to Torchwood.

34:03.888 --> 34:10.202
- Jack Harkness has treated you
in a criminally irresponsible way.
- Who? I really don't understand!

34:10.202 --> 34:12.806
Don't bother.
This is not an interrogation.

34:12.799 --> 34:15.882
Torchwood is irrelevant to us,
not even a nuisance.

34:15.879 --> 34:19.713
In fact, they've done us
quite a favour putting you in here.

34:19.712 --> 34:23.795
We've analysed your test results -
you really are something special.

34:24.949 --> 34:26.429
Agh!

34:26.428 --> 34:33.300
I got terrible guts, dunno what
it is. Bad conscience, Billy.
Try confessing. Get stuffed.

34:33.297 --> 34:36.460
OK, let's do it the hard way.

34:36.456 --> 34:39.333
CREATURE GROWLS
Merciful Christ! What the. . . ?

34:42.409 --> 34:44.377
Agh-hhh!
CREATURE ROARS

34:44.366 --> 34:46.049
They have a tendency to act up.

34:46.045 --> 34:48.492
Losing him! Please!
Something to say, Billy?

34:48.484 --> 34:52.636
Yeah, yeah, whatever you want, just
get it away from me! Get it off me!

34:56.195 --> 34:58.880
OK, Billy, you've been
on a killing spree, why?

34:58.871 --> 35:00.589
I work for the Pharm!

35:00.589 --> 35:02.750
They'd been giving people
this Reset drug.

35:02.749 --> 35:06.025
But there were these side effects -
parasites or something.

35:06.025 --> 35:10.906
They were gonna die anyway, so I had
to get rid of them before any weird
symptoms showed up. . .in public.

35:10.897 --> 35:13.457
Do you know what lymphocytes are,
Samantha?

35:13.454 --> 35:16.537
A kind of white blood cell,
part of the immune system.

35:16.531 --> 35:20.729
Well, your lymphocytes are really
quite extraordinary.

35:20.728 --> 35:25.609
We've never seen anything like
them before, not in a human being.
Aliens are a different matter.

35:25.602 --> 35:28.446
Aliens? I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.761
Your lymphocytes and God knows
what other cells have mutated.

35:30.756 --> 35:33.725
- Mutated? How?
- Under the influence of radiation.

35:33.716 --> 35:37.994
Radiation
that's not found in the temporally
stable environments on Earth.

35:37.989 --> 35:39.638
I don't know what that means.

35:39.628 --> 35:45.578
We've dealt with aliens before,
but we have never come across
anything as exotic as you.

35:45.578 --> 35:49.025
A human being who's
travelled in time and space.

35:49.018 --> 35:52.454
Tell me about it.
How is that possible?

35:52.451 --> 35:55.739
What did you see out there?

35:55.729 --> 35:57.367
This is mad.

35:57.367 --> 35:59.847
I don't know what you mean.

35:59.846 --> 36:02.644
Fine. If that's the
way you want to play it.

36:02.643 --> 36:08.320
However it happened, it means you
have a uniquely effective immune
system, which is what we need.

36:08.318 --> 36:11.196
We're developing a drug that's
going to change the world, Sam.

36:11.194 --> 36:16.075
Incurable cancers, AIDS - all the
scourges of the human race wiped out.

36:16.069 --> 36:19.197
A revolution in medicine
and social welfare.

36:19.189 --> 36:20.986
Except it's still imperfect.

36:20.986 --> 36:26.947
I'd like to know what your funky
lymphatic system makes of
those imperfections.

36:26.937 --> 36:29.337
I am not taking that!

36:29.333 --> 36:31.733
But you volunteered.

36:36.568 --> 36:41.164
OK, we're going into the Pharm
and you're going to front it.
Yeah, yeah. OK.

36:41.161 --> 36:45.450
My stomach! My stomach!
My stomach! Agh!

36:47.396 --> 36:52.311
Agh! Whoa!
Owen, we need him alive! Yeah, all
right, I'm flying blind here, Jack!

36:52.310 --> 36:55.871
Do something! Let's start with this.

37:01.424 --> 37:06.339
I think I've got it, OK?
I've got the calibrations right.
I can get it out of him.

37:07.775 --> 37:13.771
Whoa! God! Owen, deal with it.
Are you sure you had
those calibrations right?

37:13.765 --> 37:15.653
I'm sorry, all right?

37:18.043 --> 37:23.925
He must have breathed in larva
when one of his victims died.
This could have been me, or Martha.

37:27.152 --> 37:31.589
I've given her twice
the critical dose.
So, Mayfly larvae are incubating?

37:31.588 --> 37:36.036
Are you sure about this? Her
immune system's clearly reacting.

37:36.026 --> 37:38.221
There's obviously
quite a fight going on inside her.

37:38.219 --> 37:41.700
Keep your nerve.
We're making history.

37:45.331 --> 37:47.856
Ianto, what have you done
with Billy Davis' body?

37:47.851 --> 37:51.412
Um, I was just about to
dispose of it. Why?

37:51.405 --> 37:54.488
I've thought of a way we can
use him to get us into the Pharm.

37:56.602 --> 37:58.285
Clever, huh?

37:58.279 --> 38:02.887
Oh, you are warped on the inside.
How do you think of these things?

38:02.877 --> 38:05.596
I'll take that as a compliment.

38:42.472 --> 38:44.997
Tosh, Gwen, Ianto, check out Zone A.

38:44.992 --> 38:46.994
We're going after Martha. Let's go!

39:06.208 --> 39:08.369
Hands above your head!

39:08.364 --> 39:11.083
What have you done to her?

39:11.081 --> 39:16.804
Tell me that's not Reset!
She's survived the larval stage,
the only subject ever to do so.

39:16.796 --> 39:20.755
Fascinating. Turns out these
bugs practice sibling cannibalism.

39:20.753 --> 39:24.428
Only the strongest individual is left
now. God knows what happens next.

39:24.427 --> 39:26.668
Put a stop to this! I can't.

39:26.667 --> 39:28.828
I don't know how.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.162
Put your hands above your head!

40:00.349 --> 40:02.158
Ianto.

40:03.186 --> 40:05.393
Bloody hell.

40:07.700 --> 40:11.420
Jack, this thing's killing her.
I don't know what I can do.

40:11.417 --> 40:14.181
Owen, stay calm,
there has gotta be something.

40:23.404 --> 40:26.692
What's happening here?
This is what the Pharm is all about.

40:26.681 --> 40:29.969
We farm captive aliens
for the exotic chemical
products they metabolise.

40:29.958 --> 40:35.521
What the hell do you get from
a weevil? Some pesticides, and a
quite powerful chemical defoliant.

40:35.513 --> 40:39.153
But the weevils aren't what's
going to clinch the Nobel for us.

40:39.150 --> 40:42.745
The Mayfly, our feedstock for Reset.

40:42.741 --> 40:47.587
Given time, we'll tweak the
product for human use, and then
it'll be bigger than penicillin.

40:54.012 --> 40:56.060
Jack, I can give you
a report on Zone A.

40:56.049 --> 41:00.292
They're holding dozens
of creatures. They seem to be
using them as test subjects.

41:14.792 --> 41:17.750
Understood, Ianto.
Tell Tosh to go for total shutdown.

41:19.342 --> 41:24.109
This place is a torture chamber.
I don't need to debate
medical ethics with you.

41:24.100 --> 41:28.059
You abused the Mayflies,
you turned them into parasites!

41:28.053 --> 41:30.817
We didn't understand how
the Mayflies reproduced.

41:30.814 --> 41:32.770
We tried to limit the damage.

41:32.771 --> 41:35.615
What, by murdering people?
They were going to die anyway.

41:35.608 --> 41:39.487
We're on the edge of
the greatest discovery in history.
It has to be worth a few sacrifices!

41:39.482 --> 41:42.292
You must understand that, Jack,
you're involved in alien research.

41:42.282 --> 41:43.362
Not like this.

41:48.076 --> 41:54.436
I'm closing this place down.
In your dreams. This is a state
of the art, official facility.

41:54.427 --> 41:56.987
Oh, I'm not going to
do it by sending a memo.

41:56.984 --> 42:00.101
We're in control of your IT systems.

42:00.101 --> 42:04.140
As we speak, we're crashing your
data banks, wiping your records.

42:04.136 --> 42:07.025
That's cyber terrorism!
And that'sjust for starters.

42:07.016 --> 42:13.057
We're going to trip the systems
of your fire, radiation and
biohazard safety networks.

42:13.046 --> 42:15.207
The power will be cut,
sprinklers will be activated,

42:15.207 --> 42:21.567
and a large part of this facility
will be sealed and flooded with
inert gases. The aliens will die.

42:21.558 --> 42:24.243
They're already dying. This way
they'll be put out of their misery.

42:24.237 --> 42:25.966
For God's sake,
we're on the same side!

42:25.957 --> 42:32.157
No. Combating hostile aliens
is one thing, but this is slavery,
exploitation, a war crime!

42:32.147 --> 42:34.468
Jack, I need your help!

42:35.462 --> 42:38.989
What the hell are you doing? !
This is the only way
we'll save Martha.

42:38.979 --> 42:43.780
I think I understand how it works.
You'd better be sure
because it's never worked before.

42:43.774 --> 42:48.814
Owen, are you sure it's safe? OK,
Jack! Owen, tell me you're sure!

42:48.811 --> 42:52.645
You could kill her with that thing!
We're losing her!

42:53.644 --> 42:55.532
Ah!

43:00.399 --> 43:03.960
A SINGLE TONE BLEEPS
What have you done?

43:10.943 --> 43:13.343
Oh, bloody hell, it worked.
Thank God for that.

43:13.341 --> 43:15.263
Let's get her out of here.

43:21.375 --> 43:24.981
I am prescribing rest and
recuperation for you, madam,

43:24.972 --> 43:29.727
and a few days in bed,
preferably under my supervision.

43:29.726 --> 43:32.809
Owen, I don't know how to break
this to you - I've got a boyfriend.

43:32.803 --> 43:36.239
Yeah, but has he saved your life
like I did?

43:36.238 --> 43:39.446
Um, yes, actually.

43:39.437 --> 43:41.280
Oh.

43:41.277 --> 43:43.996
Arms up on there.

43:43.990 --> 43:45.992
Do it.

43:45.988 --> 43:50.869
'Facility shut down programme. All
personnel must evacuate immediately.

43:50.862 --> 43:53.467
'Facility shut down programme.

43:53.460 --> 43:56.145
'All personnel must
evacuate immediately.'

43:56.137 --> 43:58.423
OK, let's go!

43:58.414 --> 44:02.578
Did you really think I was
going to let you just walk away?

44:02.571 --> 44:07.645
You've ruined everything I've worked
for. Now, let's not be stupid. OK?

44:07.645 --> 44:11.809
We're both rational men, scientists.

44:15.636 --> 44:18.924
I know you don't want to shoot.

44:23.109 --> 44:25.384
You're next!

44:28.541 --> 44:31.146
Owen! Can you hear me, Owen? !

44:31.138 --> 44:33.584
You've got to help him!
Owen, stay with me. Owen.

44:33.578 --> 44:36.138
Owen, look at me, look at me.
Owen, look right at me.

44:36.135 --> 44:40.174
Stay with me, Owen, stay with me.
Stay with me, buddy. Come on.

44:41.969 --> 44:43.607
Owen, speak to me!

44:57.272 --> 44:59.035
He's dead.

45:05.503 --> 45:07.459
Owen. . .

45:22.566 --> 45:25.285
The time is 21.30.

45:25.282 --> 45:27.284
Autopsy on Owen Harper.

45:27.280 --> 45:29.601
Torchwood officer 565.

45:29.598 --> 45:31.964
Aged 27.

45:31.956 --> 45:34.754
Autopsy begins.

45:34.753 --> 45:37.472
The energy just went off the scale.

45:37.470 --> 45:39.745
Can you see where it is?

45:39.744 --> 45:42.144
You can't use it.
Who knows what'll happen!

45:42.144 --> 45:44.226
I was hoping for a miracle.

45:44.221 --> 45:46.781
Where did he go? It's here. Martha!

45:46.777 --> 45:50.895
It must be death,
because it's stolen my life.
