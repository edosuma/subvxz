00:13.541 --> 00:19.125


00:19.208 --> 00:22.416


00:22.500 --> 00:25.625


00:57.000 --> 01:00.458


01:32.291 --> 01:35.958
Yoo-hoo! Boys! Breakfast is ready!

01:36.041 --> 01:38.375
Be right there, Elder Kettle!

01:38.458 --> 01:40.041
Isn't he the greatest?

01:40.125 --> 01:43.916
Yeah. I can't believe how full
of life he is, especially for his age.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.458
-Don't ya just love him?

01:46.541 --> 01:47.875
Mugman.

01:47.958 --> 01:50.000
Eh.
I'm still in the "like" stage.

01:50.083 --> 01:51.625
Cuphead!

01:51.708 --> 01:53.416
What's not to love?!

01:53.500 --> 01:58.125
Well, for one thing,
he's dirty, filthy, and disgusting!

01:58.208 --> 01:59.083


01:59.166 --> 02:03.000
He can't help the way he is.
Now let's eat. I'm starvin'!

02:03.083 --> 02:03.916


02:16.500 --> 02:17.500


02:17.583 --> 02:20.208
Maybe I <i>am </i>disgusting.

02:37.916 --> 02:38.750
Ah!

02:42.000 --> 02:43.541
-Then I says--

02:45.375 --> 02:48.875
-My eyeballs are on fire!
-Why is it so bright?!

02:48.958 --> 02:53.625
Just your dear Elder Kettle
looking his shiny best.

02:53.708 --> 02:58.000
Not a single speck or smudge. No, sirree!

02:58.083 --> 02:59.750
Hope you love it.

02:59.833 --> 03:02.208
Hope it's in the "like" stage.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.458
What's with him?

03:05.041 --> 03:07.166
Get a load of this shine, would ya?

03:07.250 --> 03:08.750
I… Whoa!

03:13.958 --> 03:16.791
E-Everything's fine! Still shiny!

03:21.166 --> 03:22.416
Thanks for breakfast.

03:23.625 --> 03:25.291
See you later, Elder Kettle.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.000
Aw, that didn't go well.

03:29.083 --> 03:29.916


03:30.666 --> 03:33.541
Wonder what they're saying about me now.

03:37.166 --> 03:39.958
Looks like we were wrong
about how great he's doing.

03:40.041 --> 03:43.541
Yeah, he's gone downhill.
We gotta do something fast.

03:43.625 --> 03:45.750
-
-Did you hear a gasp?

03:45.833 --> 03:46.833


03:48.166 --> 03:53.375
Uh, sorry about that, boys.
I just gasped twice and fell down.

03:53.458 --> 03:58.375
But I'm fine!
I'm walking away now! Toodle-oo!

04:03.083 --> 04:07.416
Let's be realistic, Mugsy. I don't think
we can take care of him anymore.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.833
Are you suggesting
that we send him away?

04:10.916 --> 04:12.458
Send me away?

04:12.541 --> 04:14.750
I'm not sure we have any choice.

04:16.208 --> 04:18.083
No!

04:21.291 --> 04:23.166
Elder Kettle? Are you okay?

04:23.250 --> 04:27.583
Never been better!
Just rearranging a few things.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.708
-Here, let me help you.
-Ah!

04:29.791 --> 04:30.916
Shoo! Scat!

04:31.000 --> 04:34.875
I am perfectly capable
of doing things on my own.

04:34.958 --> 04:37.166
Are you okay, Elder Kettle?

04:37.250 --> 04:39.250
I'm not old!

04:40.875 --> 04:41.708
Oh!

04:48.250 --> 04:49.083
Eh.

05:03.583 --> 05:04.958
Uh, yoo-hoo!

05:05.041 --> 05:06.208
Boys!

05:06.958 --> 05:08.708
Watch this.

05:10.250 --> 05:11.791


05:18.625 --> 05:19.458
-Oh!

05:20.708 --> 05:21.708


05:22.416 --> 05:23.875
Ta-da!

05:24.583 --> 05:28.000
-What are you doing?
-You poor elderly thing.

05:28.083 --> 05:30.333
I'm not hurt. Not one bit.

05:30.416 --> 05:31.791
I'm hip.

05:31.875 --> 05:33.541
My hip!

05:33.625 --> 05:34.875
Do you need some help?

05:34.958 --> 05:36.625
No! I'm fine!

05:37.125 --> 05:39.166
Now close the window or…

05:39.250 --> 05:40.375
or you're grounded!

05:43.166 --> 05:47.291
Aw, dishwater.
Now what are they gonna say about me?

05:55.625 --> 05:57.750
I know you love him, Mugsy,

05:57.833 --> 06:01.333
but what other option is there?
I mean, look at him.

06:04.125 --> 06:07.041
He used to be so full of life, but now…

06:07.125 --> 06:10.583
You're right, Cuphead.
We need to put him out of his misery.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.875
We should do it
sooner rather than later.

06:13.958 --> 06:16.041
He's not gonna suffer, is he?

06:16.125 --> 06:18.041
We'll make it
quick and painless.

06:25.375 --> 06:29.041
Poor Elder Kettle. What do you suppose
he was doing up that ladder anyway?

06:29.125 --> 06:30.625
Maybe fixing the roof?

06:30.708 --> 06:34.083
You know him.
He never slows down! He's so full of life!

06:34.166 --> 06:36.000
Not like this poor little guy.

06:38.541 --> 06:40.625


06:40.708 --> 06:42.500
Let's go take care of it.

06:44.083 --> 06:46.041
Oh, wha…?

06:46.125 --> 06:48.833
-What do we do with his body?

06:48.916 --> 06:51.041
We could bury him in the backyard.

06:51.125 --> 06:54.041
Yeah. That way,
he'll still kinda be with us.

06:55.041 --> 06:55.875
Agreed.

06:58.583 --> 07:00.166
They're gonna kill me!

07:00.250 --> 07:03.083
Oh where did things go so wrong?!

07:04.875 --> 07:06.125
Traitors.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.291
Get it together, Kettle.

07:10.375 --> 07:12.166
They're just two little boys.

07:12.250 --> 07:15.708
You're a decorated war hero!

07:28.416 --> 07:30.416
Keep digging, boys.

07:31.041 --> 07:34.708
Better make that hole big enough for two.

07:35.416 --> 07:37.083
Phew! That oughta do it.

07:41.416 --> 07:44.041
-Should we say a few words?
-Sure.

07:44.916 --> 07:48.875
Shoelace, mailbox,
slingshot, octopus, bagel, lipstick…

07:48.958 --> 07:51.291
Can we just bury the earthworm already?

07:54.333 --> 07:55.791


07:56.625 --> 07:59.791
Ah! Nothing like the taste of fresh soil.

08:00.791 --> 08:01.708
He's alive!

08:03.000 --> 08:06.500
Thanks, Cuphead and Mugman.
You really helped a worm out.

08:06.583 --> 08:07.916
So long, fellas!

08:09.916 --> 08:12.041
It's a miracle!

08:12.125 --> 08:14.416
Let's tell Elder Kettle the good news!

08:15.250 --> 08:17.125
Elder Kettle! Whoa!

08:17.208 --> 08:19.250
-Wait!
-Hey, what gives?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.875
You almost tripped on something.

08:21.625 --> 08:23.041
Piano wire?

08:23.125 --> 08:24.625
-Huh.
-And is that…

08:24.708 --> 08:26.625
a tiger trap in the living room?

08:27.375 --> 08:28.208
And look!

08:28.708 --> 08:31.250
Did someone grease the stairs?

08:31.333 --> 08:33.833
This whole room is booby-trapped.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.708
What is all this?

08:36.791 --> 08:40.125
Like what you see, boys?

08:40.625 --> 08:43.458
-Is that you?
-Elder Kettle?

08:43.541 --> 08:45.833
That's right!

08:45.916 --> 08:48.583
And guess what?

08:48.666 --> 08:51.041
You'll never take me ali--

08:51.125 --> 08:53.083
Wh-Wh-Whoa!

08:55.666 --> 08:57.166
Ooh!

08:57.250 --> 08:58.291


08:58.375 --> 09:01.541
I'm okay.
Still got the upper hand.

09:01.625 --> 09:02.458
Uh-oh.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.208
-Ow!

09:05.291 --> 09:09.250
Oh, boy! That really smarts!

09:10.250 --> 09:11.916
Ow! My leg!

09:12.000 --> 09:14.291
-My other leg!

09:14.375 --> 09:15.583
-Ow!

09:20.958 --> 09:23.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:27.583 --> 09:29.916
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:33.541 --> 09:34.375


09:35.291 --> 09:38.250
I'm still okay.

09:38.750 --> 09:39.958


09:43.708 --> 09:45.875
Elder Kettle! Elder Kettle!

09:46.833 --> 09:50.125
Please! Please don't kill me.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.416
What are you talking about?

09:53.500 --> 09:55.500
I heard what you said.

09:55.583 --> 09:57.500
I'm dirty and old and weak,

09:57.583 --> 10:00.166
and you're gonna put me out of my misery

10:00.250 --> 10:03.416
and bury me in the backyard!

10:03.500 --> 10:05.208
-What?!
-No!

10:05.291 --> 10:07.041
We weren't talking about you.

10:07.125 --> 10:09.250
We were taking care of our pet worm.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.583


10:11.666 --> 10:13.458
A worm?!

10:14.083 --> 10:17.375
So you weren't trying to kill me?

10:17.458 --> 10:18.541
Kill you?

10:18.625 --> 10:20.625
You're our Elder Kettle.

10:20.708 --> 10:22.000
We <i>love</i> you.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.625
Aw!

10:23.708 --> 10:26.416
I love you boys too.

10:26.500 --> 10:30.250
To imagine that I thought
that you two were gonna kill--

10:30.333 --> 10:31.666
-Wh-wh-whoa!

10:35.375 --> 10:37.625
Yikes. He's not looking so hot.

10:38.375 --> 10:40.875
I guess we could bury him in the backyard.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.625
I'll get the shovels.
