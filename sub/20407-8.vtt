Previously on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.629 --> 00:05.863
Chef Ramsay's roulette challenge...
Miso.

00:05.931 --> 00:07.198
(Announcer)
Forced the Chefs to think fast
on their feet.

00:07.266 --> 00:08.800
Rutabaga.

00:08.867 --> 00:10.268
(Announcer)
Rob's vegetables
were disappointing.

00:10.336 --> 00:11.603
My problem with that dish

00:11.670 --> 00:13.638
is the asparagus and the yam--
it's lazy.

00:13.706 --> 00:14.706
(Announcer)
But Nona's salmon...
It's cooked perfectly.

00:14.773 --> 00:16.040
My girl Nona nails it.

00:16.108 --> 00:17.141
(Announcer)
Paid off big.
Vegas.

00:17.209 --> 00:19.944
[All cheering]

00:20.012 --> 00:22.046
(Announcer)
The next dinner service
was family night,

00:22.114 --> 00:23.715
and there was
a little added pressure.

00:23.782 --> 00:25.250
In amongst
those diners tonight,

00:25.317 --> 00:26.985
my family.

00:27.052 --> 00:28.886
(Announcer)
The night started off rocky...

00:28.954 --> 00:30.421
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Disgusting!</i>

00:30.489 --> 00:31.990
(Announcer)
With Boris making a mess.

00:32.057 --> 00:32.824
Boris is a Russian
[Bleep] egg.

00:32.891 --> 00:34.392
Slow down, Boris.

00:34.460 --> 00:36.094
(Announcer)
Vinny made a critical mistake.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.495
(Gordon)
That's old.

00:37.563 --> 00:38.963
I wouldn't do this
to your family.

00:39.031 --> 00:40.298
(Announcer)
In the red kitchen...

00:40.366 --> 00:42.100
Can you stop giving me
an attitude?

00:42.167 --> 00:43.401
(Announcer)
Sabrina and Trev
were at each other's throats.

00:43.469 --> 00:45.236
Sabrina!
Knock it off!

00:45.304 --> 00:46.804
(Announcer)
But in an amazing turn
of events...

00:46.872 --> 00:48.740
Service, please.
Let's go. Delicious.

00:48.807 --> 00:50.408
(Announcer)
Strong performances by...
<i>Russell.</i>

00:50.476 --> 00:52.043
And...
<i>Jillian.</i>

00:52.111 --> 00:54.078
Enabled both kitchens
to have their best service yet.

00:54.146 --> 00:56.981
90% from our cusmer
comment cards

00:57.049 --> 00:58.650
said they left happy.

00:58.717 --> 00:59.984
<i>Well done.</i>

01:00.052 --> 01:01.653
(Announcer)
But both teams still had

01:01.720 --> 01:03.054
to nominate two of their own
for elimination.

01:03.122 --> 01:04.855
The red team
put up Sabrina and Nona,

01:04.923 --> 01:06.190
and the blue team nominated...

01:06.258 --> 01:07.592
Boris.

01:07.660 --> 01:09.060
An

01:09.128 --> 01:10.728
Chef Ramsay narrowed
the field.

01:10.796 --> 01:12.930
Nona and Rob,
step forward.

01:12.998 --> 01:14.465
(Announcer)
Rob blamed Russell.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.067
I got zero support
on that station.

01:16.135 --> 01:17.702
Russell, is that true?

01:17.770 --> 01:20.171
I can't do everything
on the station for him.

01:20.239 --> 01:22.907
(Announcer)
And then Chef Ramsay
did something highly unusual.

01:22.975 --> 01:24.475
Relax,
it was a good service.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.511
(Announcer)
He gave them a pass.

01:26.578 --> 01:28.279
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Why should anyone</i>
<i>go home?</i>

01:28.347 --> 01:29.013
(Announcer)
But he also gave them
a warning.

01:29.081 --> 01:30.081
The next dinner service

01:30.149 --> 01:33.918
is the most importar

01:33.986 --> 01:35.753

And now the continuation
of <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

02:42.955 --> 02:45.289
Chef Ramsay [Bleep] me hard
on that one.

02:45.357 --> 02:48.025
Oh, my God.
I'm still here.

02:48.093 --> 02:49.494
I didn't think
I deserved to be up there.

02:49.561 --> 02:51.763
Wow, that was [Bleep] up.

02:51.830 --> 02:54.632
Russell did this to rattle you.
Yeah.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.267
Russell, he threw me
under the [Bleep] bus.

02:56.335 --> 02:57.769
I wanna beat
some Russell ass.

02:57.836 --> 02:58.703
Yeah, I know.
[bleep] Him, right?

02:58.771 --> 03:01.639
No doubt about it.

03:01.707 --> 03:03.641
I didn't think you
did bad tonight.

03:03.709 --> 03:06.711
Why did you vote
for methen?

03:06.779 --> 03:08.713
'Cause I didn't know
who else to vote for.

03:08.781 --> 03:09.814
<i>If you didn't know</i>
<i>who else to vote for,</i>

03:09.882 --> 03:10.681
<i>you're right,</i>
<i>vote for me.</i>

03:10.749 --> 03:12.617
That makes a lot of sense.

03:12.684 --> 03:15.019
I kind of want to make her
feel better,

03:15.087 --> 03:17.054
but if not,
then that's cool too.

03:17.122 --> 03:18.823
I really don't care.

03:18.891 --> 03:20.591
Sabrina's just a little baby.
I'm gonna go to bed.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.093
She has no experience.

03:22.161 --> 03:24.028
She was the weakest link
since day one,

03:24.096 --> 03:25.363
and we're sick
of carrying her.

03:25.431 --> 03:26.864
<i>With that attitude,</i>

03:26.932 --> 03:28.399
she ain't gonna be here
much longer anyways.

03:28.467 --> 03:29.534
I'm ready for Sabrina
to go home.

03:29.601 --> 03:31.569
I've had enough
of her shenanigans.

03:31.637 --> 03:32.804
'Cause there's no way in hell
she would ever win this.

03:32.871 --> 03:34.038
Exactly.
Let her sink.

03:34.106 --> 03:36.174
Hell, yeah.
[laughs]

While a tense evening

03:38.243 --> 03:40.178
ends with laughter,

03:40.245 --> 03:42.046
an early-morning
wake-up call...

03:42.114 --> 03:43.614
Meet me down front

Let's go as fast as we can.

03:46.718 --> 03:48.286
We run downstairs,
and I don't even know

03:48.353 --> 03:52.156
what the hell's going on,
honestly.

03:52.224 --> 03:53.825
So we have to win.

03:53.892 --> 03:55.193
Right, good morning.
(All)
Morning, Chef.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.595
I brought you his fantastic mart

03:57.663 --> 04:00.364
<i>where we've got the most</i>
<i>amazing selection of food.</i>

04:00.432 --> 04:01.699
<i>And it's your job</i>
<i>to create</i>

04:01.767 --> 04:03.134
four stunning dishes--

04:03.202 --> 04:04.435
a beef, a pork, a lamb,
and a chicken.

04:04.503 --> 04:05.870

<i>is responsible</i>
<i>for cooking one dish.</i>

04:08.207 --> 04:09.907
Now, Jillian and Gail,
you pair up.

04:09.975 --> 04:11.509
There's obviously
five of you on the red team.

04:11.577 --> 04:12.777
<i>You'll be working</i>
<i>on one entree.</i>

04:12.845 --> 04:15.847

04:15.914 --> 04:17.081
<i>20 minutes to shop.</i>

04:17.149 --> 04:18.249
Are you ready?
Yes, Chef.

04:18.317 --> 04:19.716
Off you go.

04:19.785 --> 04:20.918
Come on, let's go.
Get to the meat section.

04:20.986 --> 04:22.553
Talk as we walk.

04:22.621 --> 04:24.455
(Announcer)
The Chefs have 20 minutes
and $60

04:24.523 --> 04:27.158
to shop for the ingredients
for four meat dishes.

04:27.226 --> 04:28.860
Beef. The lamb?

04:28.927 --> 04:30.595
I'll do lamb or chick--
whatever you want.

04:30.662 --> 04:32.163
You want lamb?
Yeah, that's fine.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.131
Down this aisle, please.
Down this aisle.

04:34.199 --> 04:35.600
Can we move faster, please?

04:35.667 --> 04:37.602
Wow, look at this.
Focus, let's go.

04:37.669 --> 04:39.737
Come on, guys, I wanna go
to this rack right here.

04:39.805 --> 04:41.005
Boris.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.640
Shopping together as a team

04:42.708 --> 04:44.642
is like shopping
with three children.

04:44.710 --> 04:46.077
<i>Vinny, come back.</i>

04:46.144 --> 04:47.812
Protein, protein.
Come on.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.313
Russell,
shut the [Bleep] up.

04:49.381 --> 04:51.015
Pick it up.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.117
(Announcer)
While one member
of the blue team

04:53.185 --> 04:54.118
makes his presence known,
one member of the red team...

04:54.186 --> 04:56.220
I wanna do lamb
and lentils.

04:56.288 --> 04:58.122
Struggles to be heard.

04:58.190 --> 04:59.790
I wanna do lamb
and lentils.

04:59.858 --> 05:02.260
Hey, guys.
Could we use lentils, guys?

05:02.327 --> 05:03.761
I need to get a rib eye.

05:03.829 --> 05:04.862
Could we get
one pork tenderloin?

05:04.930 --> 05:05.763
I wanna do lamb
and lentils.

05:05.831 --> 05:06.731
<i>Five minutes are left.</i>

05:06.798 --> 05:07.765
Hello.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.166
I'm doing lentils.

05:09.234 --> 05:11.068
30 seconds--
use the time wisely.

05:11.136 --> 05:13.337
Let's go, baby.
Can I get loin lamb chops?

05:13.405 --> 05:15.640
Ten seconds.
Come on, come on.
Come on, red team.

05:15.707 --> 05:17.575
Five...
Two slices of slab bacon.

05:17.643 --> 05:19.110
<i>Four...</i>
Grabbing parsnips.

05:19.177 --> 05:20.578
Three...
Hey, come on.

05:20.646 --> 05:22.046
<i>Two...</i>
Fresh spinach.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.015
One. That's it.
Check out, everybody.

05:24.082 --> 05:24.882
(Announcer)
The shopping part
of the challenge

05:24.950 --> 05:26.217
is now complete.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.286
No whammies,
and stop at 60 bucks.

05:28.353 --> 05:29.820
(Announcer)
And while the blue team
is on budget...

05:29.888 --> 05:31.155
$60. You made it.

05:31.223 --> 05:33.190
The red team...
<i>We're at $66.97.</i>

05:33.258 --> 05:35.092
Has exceeded their $60 limit.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.161
How much were the lentils?
$5.99.

05:37.229 --> 05:38.529
Sabrina got, like,

05:38.597 --> 05:40.498
the most expensive bag
of lentils.

05:40.566 --> 05:42.633
Take out a chicken breast.
All right, well,
total everything up.

05:42.701 --> 05:44.335
What a selfish little bitch
Sabrina is.

05:44.403 --> 05:46.571
<i>$60.</i>
[all cheering]

05:46.638 --> 05:49.640
(Jillian)
All right, guys,
we got this.

05:49.708 --> 05:51.175
Okay, let's go.

05:51.243 --> 05:53.411
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay has designed this challenge

05:53.478 --> 05:55.346
to test the Chefs' ability
of taking

05:55.414 --> 05:56.981
classic ingredients...
I'll take the meat station.

05:57.049 --> 05:59.150
And turning them
into high-end, expensive dishes.

05:59.217 --> 06:00.985
Let's nail this, guys.

06:01.053 --> 06:02.687
(Announcer)
The Chefs will now have
45 minutes

06:02.754 --> 06:05.523
to transform their four meats
into entrees

06:05.591 --> 06:08.192
worthy of a fine-dining
restaurant.

06:08.260 --> 06:09.860
<i>(Sabrina)</i>
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

06:09.928 --> 06:11.295
I was a little bit worried
about Sabrina's lentils,

06:11.363 --> 06:12.763
because on the package,

06:12.831 --> 06:14.065
it says they take
45 minutes to cook.

06:14.132 --> 06:15.700
We only have 45 minutes.

06:15.767 --> 06:17.034
Sabrina, you okay?
Do you need anything?

06:17.102 --> 06:19.036
No.
Yeah, right.

06:19.104 --> 06:20.905
I don't need
their [Bleep] help.

06:20.973 --> 06:22.573
I wanna show Chef Ramsay
that I'm a good cook,

06:22.641 --> 06:23.808
and I deserve to be here.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.209
Ten minutes to go.

06:25.277 --> 06:26.444
<i>Let's go, Sabrina.</i>
Yes, Chef.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.412
<i>Yeah?</i>

06:28.480 --> 06:30.681
(Announcer)
While the red team worries
about Sabrina...

06:30.749 --> 06:32.049
Everybody watch the [Bleep]
that's in the oven.

06:32.117 --> 06:33.250
(Announcer)
Russell worries about everybody.

06:33.318 --> 06:35.353
Vinny are you gonna add
any stock to it?
Yes.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.088
We've gotta win
this challenge.

06:37.155 --> 06:38.589
I am gonna keep
a close eye on everybody.

06:38.657 --> 06:40.057
Rob, did you season
your puree?

06:40.125 --> 06:41.826
No, I didn't season it yet.
It tastes burnt.

06:41.893 --> 06:43.794
Rob, watch
your steak, please.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.696
<i>Dude, I just put it in.</i>

06:45.764 --> 06:47.365
Steak's in the oven.
It's like, "thanks, douche bag,

06:47.432 --> 06:49.066
like, I don't know that."

06:49.134 --> 06:50.368
30 seconds to go.
(All)
Yes, Chef.

06:50.435 --> 06:51.902
The peaches are perfect,
Jillian.

06:51.970 --> 06:53.204
Take that off.
Russ, be cool, man.
Chill out.

06:53.271 --> 06:55.406
Five...
Vinny, start plating.

<i>Four...</i>
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>

With the cooking portion
of the challenge complete,

07:02.214 --> 07:03.648
meat dishes
on each team

07:03.715 --> 07:05.316
will now be priced.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.218
The team with the highest
combined total

07:07.285 --> 07:09.053
of all their dishes
wins the challenge.

07:09.121 --> 07:10.955
An esteemed panel
of judges

07:11.023 --> 07:13.290
<i>will decide on what</i>
<i>they're prepared to pay.</i>

07:13.358 --> 07:14.859
<i>Time to meet our judges.</i>

07:14.926 --> 07:17.061
The Owner/Chef patron
of the restaurant Campanile,

07:17.129 --> 07:19.563
extraordinary Mark Peel.

07:19.631 --> 07:21.365
[Applause]

07:21.433 --> 07:22.500
Good morning.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.035
Mark Peel is a badass.

07:24.102 --> 07:25.670
And he's a great Chef.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.204
Thank you so much
for coming.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.005
Absolute pleasure.
Thank you.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.273
Our next judge,

07:29.341 --> 07:31.242
a world-renowned food critic,

07:31.309 --> 07:33.878
the owner of Gayot Guidebooks,
Sophie Gayot.

07:33.945 --> 07:36.247
[Applause]

07:36.314 --> 07:39.383
And our next judge,

07:39.451 --> 07:43.154
an elite food blogger
from Yelp, Libby Rego.

07:43.221 --> 07:44.855
[Applause]
Thank you.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.625
<i>Our last judge,</i>
<i>this man's the current</i>

07:47.693 --> 07:49.627
general manager
of the Nobu West Hollywood.

07:49.695 --> 07:51.562
<i>Say good morning</i>
<i>to Justin Wyborn.</i>

07:51.630 --> 07:53.230
<i>Justin, good morning.</i>
[applause]

07:53.298 --> 07:55.399
These are, like,
legitimate judges.

07:55.467 --> 07:58.369
This is the real deal.
These people know their [Bleep].

07:58.437 --> 08:00.671
Let's start
with the two beef dishes.

08:00.739 --> 08:02.573
<i>Sophie Gayot will be judging</i>
<i>this round.</i>

08:02.641 --> 08:04.775
(Announcer)
First up, it's Nona versus Rob.

08:04.843 --> 08:06.510
This is a pan-seared
rib eye

08:06.578 --> 08:08.479
<i>with a parsnip puree,</i>
<i>sauteed broccolini,</i>

08:08.547 --> 08:10.614
and red-wine balsamic
reduction.

08:10.682 --> 08:13.184
Quality of the beef
is very tender.

08:13.251 --> 08:15.386
<i>But the only thing</i>
<i>that doesn't look too nice</i>

08:15.454 --> 08:17.088
is the broccoli just sitting
right there on the plate.

08:17.155 --> 08:18.689
It doesn't look
very elegant.

08:18.757 --> 08:19.990
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Good point. Very good point.</i>

08:20.058 --> 08:21.058
<i>(Sophie)</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:21.126 --> 08:24.295
Battle of the beef.
Next one up.

08:24.362 --> 08:26.363
I have a very nice grilled
New York strip

08:26.431 --> 08:28.432
with cipollini onion
and crispy shiitake mushroom.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.467
Mmm.

08:29.534 --> 08:31.268
<i>Very light.</i>

08:31.336 --> 08:33.169
Yeah,
very nice New York strip.

08:33.238 --> 08:35.272
But why do you put
so much onions?

08:37.842 --> 08:39.376
The big question is,
how much would you pay

08:39.443 --> 08:40.977
<i>for Nona's on the red team,</i>

08:41.046 --> 08:43.013
<i>and how much would you pay</i>
<i>for Rob's on the menu?</i>

08:43.081 --> 08:45.616
Red team, you put more time
on preparing the meat.

08:45.684 --> 08:48.753
<i>I would pay $32</i>
<i>for the red team,</i>

08:48.820 --> 08:51.455
and I would pay $26
for the blue team beef dish.

08:51.523 --> 08:54.225
A $6 difference? Are you
[Bleep] out of your mind?

08:54.292 --> 08:56.127
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

08:56.194 --> 08:58.596
She said my dish
was worth $32.

08:59.898 --> 09:01.065
This is so cool.

09:01.133 --> 09:02.533
Next,
the battle of the pork

09:02.601 --> 09:04.602
<i>judged by Mark Peel.</i>

09:04.669 --> 09:06.270
(Announcer)
With the red team
jumping out to a $6 lead...

09:06.338 --> 09:07.772
Let's go, Boris.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.406
(Announcer)
Boris will try to close the gap

09:09.474 --> 09:10.775
as he goes up against Gail
and Jillian.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.443
I have a marinated
pork tenderloin

09:12.444 --> 09:15.446
with some

09:15.514 --> 09:17.748
I love the color.
Thank you.

09:17.816 --> 09:20.050
But the pork itself,
bone dry.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.721
Gail, please.
Pan-seared pork tenderloin

09:23.789 --> 09:26.791
<i>with roasted peach</i>
<i>and shallots.</i>

09:26.858 --> 09:29.193
<i>The peaches are great.</i>

09:29.261 --> 09:30.928
But the pork tenderloin,
a little bit bland.

09:33.231 --> 09:34.131
So prices
on this piece, mark.

09:34.199 --> 09:37.301
Um...

09:37.369 --> 09:40.404
$28, $26.

09:40.472 --> 09:43.874
Thank you, Chef.

09:43.942 --> 09:46.243
I'm hoping between me and Vinny,
we can pull it out.

09:46.311 --> 09:48.379
Let's go.
Battle of the chicken.

09:48.446 --> 09:50.347
(Announcer)
The red team has now
widened the gap to $8.

09:50.415 --> 09:53.184
Our judge will be Libby
from Yelp.

09:53.251 --> 09:55.953
(Announcer)
And Russell is counting
on his chicken cacciatore

09:56.021 --> 09:57.521
with rustic potatoes...

09:57.589 --> 09:59.957
Chicken is juicy
and also flavorful.

10:00.025 --> 10:01.692
But the potato's
a little undercooked.

10:01.760 --> 10:02.960
(Announcer)
To fetch a higher price

10:03.028 --> 10:05.262
than Trev's lemon-roasted
chicken breast.

10:05.330 --> 10:06.897
The skin is cooked very nicely.
It's nice and crisp.

10:06.965 --> 10:08.866
Yeah.

10:08.934 --> 10:11.836
The carrots
are a little undercooked.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.537
And the big question,
Libby.

10:13.605 --> 10:14.738
For Trevor's dish,
how much would you be

10:14.806 --> 10:16.106
<i>happy to pay for that?</i>

10:16.174 --> 10:18.809
I would say probably
in the $22 range.

10:18.877 --> 10:20.544
This one here...

10:20.612 --> 10:22.713
$26.
<i>Excellent. Well done.</i>

10:22.781 --> 10:24.048
Thank you.

10:24.115 --> 10:26.016
We're back in the game.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.519
Vinny, you better [Bleep]
Pull this out for us.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.120
(Announcer)
Thanks to Russell,

10:30.188 --> 10:31.422
the margin
has been cut in half,

10:31.489 --> 10:34.124
and the blue team is trailing
by just $4.

10:34.192 --> 10:35.993
Now, in the battle
of the lamb dishes...

10:36.061 --> 10:37.995
<i>Judged by Stin Wyborn</i>
<i>from Nobu.</i>

10:38.063 --> 10:39.630
It's Vinny versus Sabrina.

10:39.698 --> 10:41.298
It's all up to me and my dish.

10:41.366 --> 10:42.633
My team was right.

10:42.701 --> 10:43.767
Maybe I shouldn't have
chose lentils.

10:43.835 --> 10:45.402
I cannot lose this one.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.371
<i>I chose to do lamb</i>
<i>with lentil.</i>

10:47.439 --> 10:50.674
It's just carrots
with a red-wine sauce.

10:51.910 --> 10:54.178
Um...

10:55.480 --> 10:56.814
Lamb's cooked really well.

10:56.882 --> 10:58.215
Thank you.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.817
<i>I like the red-wine sauce.</i>
Nice.

10:59.885 --> 11:01.285
Uh, Vinny.

11:01.353 --> 11:04.255
<i>I used a round bone lamb chop</i>
<i>with a red potato.</i>

11:04.322 --> 11:06.123
I'm confident
I can beat Sabrina,

11:06.191 --> 11:07.791
the most inexperienced person
on that team.

11:07.859 --> 11:09.493
It's got plenty of flavor.

11:09.561 --> 11:10.761
Yeah, it's good,
really good.

11:10.829 --> 11:12.396
Okay. Prices.

11:12.464 --> 11:13.998
<i>The blue team's lamb dish</i>

11:14.065 --> 11:17.334
aesthetically
wasn't that pleasing.

11:17.402 --> 11:18.335
The red team's lamb dish,

11:18.403 --> 11:20.804
<i>um...</i>

11:20.872 --> 11:22.406
<i>I don't usually</i>
<i>order things</i>

11:22.474 --> 11:25.342
with, uh, lentils.

11:25.410 --> 11:26.777
How much would you be
happy to pay?

11:26.845 --> 11:28.979

In today's profitability
challenge,

11:39.027 --> 11:41.528
the blue team trails
by $4.

11:41.596 --> 11:43.397
Okay. Prices.

11:43.464 --> 11:45.032
(Announcer)
And it all comes down
to Vinny's lamb

11:45.099 --> 11:46.533
versus Sabrina's.

11:46.601 --> 11:50.170
I'd pay $23 for the blue team's
lamb dish.

11:50.238 --> 11:52.206
So you've got $101 as a total.

11:52.273 --> 11:54.241
(Announcer)
Now Sabrina's dish

11:54.309 --> 11:56.944
must be worth more than $19
to win it for her team.

11:57.011 --> 11:58.745
<i>Sabrina's lamb.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:58.813 --> 12:01.648
I don't usually order things
with, uh, lentils.

12:01.716 --> 12:03.217
But I like it.

12:03.284 --> 12:04.551
<i>Got</i>
<i>plenty of flavor.</i>

12:04.619 --> 12:05.819
$28 for that.

12:05.887 --> 12:07.721
[All cheering]

12:07.789 --> 12:09.056
I redeemed myself.

12:09.123 --> 12:10.457
I swear to God
I redeemed myself.

12:10.525 --> 12:12.392
Thank you so much.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.862

12:14.929 --> 12:17.264
but when you're this happy,
like, it's okay.

12:17.332 --> 12:20.901
We did it, we did it,

12:20.969 --> 12:22.269
<i>Ah, judges,</i>

Thank you.

12:22.337 --> 12:25.072

<i>You will spend</i>

<i>you'll then cover up</i>
<i>and wrap both kitchens,</i>

because you're gonna be
fumigating the kitchen.

12:56.604 --> 12:58.505
Now I'm [Bleep] pissed.

12:58.573 --> 12:59.940
I hate this [Bleep].
I [Bleep] hate losing.

Okay. Upstairs.

Thank you, Chef.

13:07.782 --> 13:12.886
[Kicks trash can]
I'm pissed.

13:12.954 --> 13:14.588
I'm just mentally
gonna lose my mind.

13:14.656 --> 13:16.456
Oh, you better

13:16.524 --> 13:17.724
<i>'cause the way we're going,</i>
<i>we ain't gonna win</i>

I can't believe
I [Bleep] That one up.

13:22.397 --> 13:24.064
I'm so disappointed in myself
right now.

13:24.132 --> 13:25.165
It was so embarrassing
for me tonight.

13:25.233 --> 13:27.401
I was defeated by Sabrina,

13:27.468 --> 13:29.369
the most inexperienced Chef
on the team.

13:29.437 --> 13:31.538
The bitch is 22 years old.

13:31.606 --> 13:33.774

While the mood on the blue team
continues to sink,

13:33.841 --> 13:36.410
the red team is soaring
and is now setting sail.

13:36.477 --> 13:38.478
Whoo!
[laughs]

13:38.546 --> 13:39.913
I'm on a boat.

13:39.981 --> 13:42.382
The red team is kicking ass
right now!

<i>(Gail)</i>
<i>I had my doubts</i>
<i>about the $6 lentils,</i>

13:44.686 --> 13:45.919
but Sabrina knocked it out.

13:45.987 --> 13:47.621
Finally, you know, for once,

13:47.689 --> 13:49.356
it was, like, my team
gave me credit for the win.

13:49.424 --> 13:50.624
I hear bongos.

13:50.692 --> 13:52.092
Then all of a sudden,

13:52.160 --> 13:54.194
we hear
a little bit of salsa music.

13:54.262 --> 13:55.495
This is for us.

14:07.942 --> 14:11.211
I'm shot.
I'm shot right now, bro.

Rob was fuming today,
fuming over this punishment.

14:14.415 --> 14:17.017
Me and him flat out
lost today.

14:17.085 --> 14:18.785
I'm tired
of this [Bleep].

14:18.853 --> 14:20.854
I didn't come here to wrap
tables in plastic wrap.

14:20.922 --> 14:22.689
I'm over losing.

While the blue team

14:24.425 --> 14:26.259
continues to be
absolutely miserable,

former teammate Trev
is feeling just fine.

You guys have proven to me

I'm definitely
on the right team now.

14:32.767 --> 14:34.368
It turns out this is exactly
where I need to be.

14:34.435 --> 14:36.837
I'm sorry that I didn't think so
right off the bat.

14:36.904 --> 14:38.939
Shut up.
We're a kick-ass team.

14:39.007 --> 14:40.841
It's not because
he's on our team.

nothing to do with us

14:42.310 --> 14:43.944

14:44.012 --> 14:45.512
We've killed it on every challenge.
Yeah, we have.

I know, seriously,
you're so lucky.

14:47.415 --> 14:49.016
I don't know.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.951
Yeah.

While Trev tries to make
his case with the red team,

14:53.988 --> 14:55.522
back in Hell's Kitchen...

14:55.590 --> 14:57.791
I hate fumigating it.

14:57.859 --> 14:59.226

15:11.773 --> 15:14.241
Pushing this suit
to the limit.

15:14.308 --> 15:15.542
<i>Oh, it split!</i>

15:15.610 --> 15:17.778
I told you. I told you.
[laughter]

15:17.845 --> 15:19.546
Look, yeah.
I split the [Bleep].

in a hazmat suit ♪

15:23.551 --> 15:25.485

[salsa music playing]

15:27.855 --> 15:29.056
I love salsa.

15:29.123 --> 15:30.724
I like sal--
chips and salsa,

15:30.792 --> 15:31.925
but I like salsa music.

15:31.993 --> 15:33.393
It's just so much fun.

15:33.461 --> 15:35.028
Yeah!

15:37.665 --> 15:39.800
(Announcer)
After a rewarding day
of fun in the sun...

15:39.867 --> 15:41.568
[All cheering]

15:41.636 --> 15:44.237
The red team returns
to Hell's Kitchen

15:44.305 --> 15:46.473
to find the blue team...
Hate this.
I've had it.

15:46.541 --> 15:49.976
(Announcer)
Still fuming
over their punishment.

15:50.044 --> 15:51.511
All right,
let's continue.

15:51.579 --> 15:52.846
We don't have time
to [Bleep] Around.

15:52.914 --> 15:54.648
Rob looked pissed.

15:56.184 --> 15:58.652
Oh, chill out.
I don't really wanna hear it.

15:58.719 --> 15:59.986
Enough's enough.

16:00.054 --> 16:01.188
I would wear a mask
if I were you.

16:01.255 --> 16:02.556
I'd wear a mask 'cause

16:02.623 --> 16:04.091
I smell Sabrina
through this one.

16:04.158 --> 16:05.725
You have fun.
Finish fumigating.

16:05.793 --> 16:07.627
I'm going to bed,

16:07.695 --> 16:09.663
because I wanna win this [Bleep]
Tomorrow again.

16:09.730 --> 16:10.964
Good night, y'all.

16:14.001 --> 16:15.635
(Announcer)
After a late night,

16:15.703 --> 16:17.170
the teams
are back to work early...

16:17.238 --> 16:19.406
I gotta do palms
and gnocchi.

16:19.474 --> 16:21.541
(Announcer)
As they prepare for tonight's
black-tie affair.

16:21.609 --> 16:22.843
Teamwork, teamwork.

16:22.910 --> 16:24.311
But Russell,

16:24.378 --> 16:26.079
still reeling
from the blue team's loss...

16:26.147 --> 16:27.180
Vinny, what station
are you prepping today?

16:27.248 --> 16:28.915
Garnish.
I'm gonna do fish.

16:28.983 --> 16:31.551
(Announcer)
Is determined to whip his team
into shape.

16:31.619 --> 16:33.620
It's gonna be no more
Mr. nice guy.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.388
I'm gonna shove my foot up
somebody's [Bleep] Tonight.

16:35.456 --> 16:36.823
Boris,
aren't you setting up fish?

16:36.891 --> 16:38.492
Yeah, the crab
is fish, no?

16:38.559 --> 16:40.127
No, it's not.
It's coming off hot apps.

16:40.194 --> 16:42.028
Boris needs a hand
more than everybody else,

16:42.096 --> 16:43.964
just on focusing
on one task at hand.

16:44.031 --> 16:45.532
Vinny, do you need
green beans for the chicken?

16:45.600 --> 16:47.067
Yes.

16:47.135 --> 16:48.935
Boris, I think we should
all worry about our stations,

16:49.003 --> 16:50.270
and then we can start
branching out.

16:50.338 --> 16:51.805
Dude, you're trying to be
the boss here.

16:51.873 --> 16:52.739
You're trying to play
big Willie,

16:52.807 --> 16:54.441
but it's not constructive.

16:54.509 --> 16:56.076
Russ, he's not a good leader.
He's just a [Bleep].

16:56.144 --> 16:57.344
I'm tired of that [Bleep].

16:57.411 --> 16:58.812
Are you all done with fish?

16:58.880 --> 17:00.447
I'm working on the fish
right now.

17:00.515 --> 17:01.815
Do you need green beans
for fish?

17:01.883 --> 17:03.483
Russ, if I'm prepping fish,
I'm prepping fish.

17:03.551 --> 17:05.018
All right, bro.
Whatever.

17:05.086 --> 17:06.586
Boris
needs to step his game up.

17:06.654 --> 17:08.821
Otherwise, Boris' ass is getting
kicked back to Russia.

17:08.890 --> 17:10.624
(Announcer)
While Boris continues to feel
the heat from Russell...

17:10.691 --> 17:12.224
Boris,
set up your section.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.894
(Announcer)
Over in the red kitchen,

17:13.961 --> 17:15.962
Trev is giving his teammates
the cold shoulder.

17:16.030 --> 17:17.396
Trevor, do you need help?
I can help you.
Nope.

17:17.464 --> 17:19.132
<i>Are you sure you don't</i>
<i>want any help?</i>

17:19.200 --> 17:20.066
'Cause you have
a lot of dough there,

17:20.134 --> 17:21.367
<i>and I'm not doing anything.</i>

17:21.435 --> 17:23.069
No, I'm an ignoramus,
and I'm just gonna

17:23.137 --> 17:24.905
[bleep] Everything up tonight.

17:24.972 --> 17:26.573
I'm tired, I'm cranky.

17:26.641 --> 17:28.375
I'm just sick of being
taken for [Bleep] granted

17:28.442 --> 17:30.110
by the girls.
<i>You all right, Trevor?</i>

17:30.178 --> 17:31.845
If I want a babysitter,
I'll hire you.

17:31.913 --> 17:33.079
I don't know
what his problem is.

17:33.147 --> 17:34.614
Maybe he's on his period
or something.

17:34.682 --> 17:36.416
Somebody's using my pot
for a spoon.

17:36.484 --> 17:38.418
The spoons were already
in that pot, actually.

17:38.486 --> 17:41.154
<i>(Jillian)</i>
<i>Stop [Bleep] your pants, Trev.</i>

17:41.222 --> 17:42.622
<i>(Sabrina)</i>
<i>Yeah, relax.</i>

17:42.690 --> 17:44.424
The negative focus
is off of me,

17:44.492 --> 17:46.459
and it's starting to be
on Trevor.

17:46.527 --> 17:48.094
I'm pissing him off
so bad.

17:48.162 --> 17:49.362
<i>[Laughs]</i>

17:49.430 --> 17:51.031
(Announcer)
Clearly,

17:51.098 --> 17:52.566
both teams still have internal
issues to work out.

17:52.633 --> 17:53.934
But the doors
of Hell's Kitchen

17:54.001 --> 17:55.769
will be opening
in less than an hour.

17:55.836 --> 17:57.470
Okay, guys out the front door
right away.

17:57.538 --> 17:59.739
And for the first time,
Chef Ramsay has decided

17:59.807 --> 18:02.242
to do his
pre-dinner pep talk outside.

18:02.310 --> 18:03.977
Let's go, guys.
Come over.

18:04.045 --> 18:05.512
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>

18:05.580 --> 18:07.480
<i>Okay, tonight is</i>

18:07.548 --> 18:10.150
a very,
very important evening.

18:10.218 --> 18:12.719
It's a black-tie event,
invitation only.

18:12.787 --> 18:15.589
Hell's Kitchen is opening
for its 100th time.

18:15.656 --> 18:17.724
Hell, yeah.

18:17.792 --> 18:20.293
That's just awesome that
we get to be a part of that.

18:20.361 --> 18:22.095
I mean, what an honor.

18:22.163 --> 18:24.197
So, all of you,
take a good look...

18:24.265 --> 18:25.398
Up there.

18:25.466 --> 18:27.400
Is that a blimp?

18:27.468 --> 18:29.436
Man, hell, no,
that's a blimp.

18:29.503 --> 18:31.004
How the hell did Chef Ramsay

18:31.072 --> 18:32.305
get the blimp
to come over here?

18:32.373 --> 18:34.507
That's right.
The Goodyear blimp

18:34.575 --> 18:37.510

An there's ever a night

18:43.117 --> 18:46.519
where I need 100 percent smooth service,
It's tonight.

18:46.587 --> 18:49.122
Tonight's the 100th dinner
service at Hell's Kitchen.

18:49.190 --> 18:51.358
If you think you're big,
you get a blimp.

18:51.425 --> 18:52.926
<i>They'll be a Chef's table</i>
<i>from each kitchen as well.</i>

18:52.994 --> 18:54.928
And the guests dining
at those Chef's tables

18:54.996 --> 18:57.664
have a very special connection
to Hell's Kitchen.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.334
Uh-oh,
who's coming out that limo?

19:01.402 --> 19:02.202
You know,
I'm getting real excited.

19:02.270 --> 19:03.703
Say good evening.

19:03.771 --> 19:06.172
Maybe it's, like, Kobe.
Maybe it's Diddy.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.508
Oh, I hope it's P. Diddy.

19:08.576 --> 19:09.643
[Cheers and applause]

19:09.710 --> 19:11.144
Oh, my goodness.

19:17.071 --> 19:20.741

Hell's Kitchen celebrates
it's 100th dinner service.

19:22.611 --> 19:24.211
How are you feeling?

19:24.279 --> 19:26.113
[Crying]

19:26.181 --> 19:28.816
I can't believe I'm crying.
I'm cracking up right now.

19:28.883 --> 19:31.018
<i>For God's sake, man.</i>

19:31.086 --> 19:32.486
Now you're making me
feel nervous.

19:32.554 --> 19:34.254
[Crying]

19:34.322 --> 19:39.026
(Announcer)
Now, back to our 100th
dinner service.

19:39.094 --> 19:41.495
Tonight is Hell's Kitchen's
centennial dinner service.

19:41.563 --> 19:44.498
And to celebrate
this momentous occasion,

19:44.566 --> 19:46.667
Chef Ramsay has invited
some appropriate V.I.P.s

19:46.735 --> 19:48.669
the Chef's tables.

19:48.737 --> 19:50.604
Guests dining

Good to see you guys.
Thank you, Chef.

20:14.529 --> 20:16.063
<i>Big night tonight.</i>

20:16.131 --> 20:17.898
I want this service to be
absolutely unique.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.900
<i>Every time you look</i>
<i>at those Chef's tables,</i>

20:19.968 --> 20:21.835
<i>think--you could part</i>

20:21.903 --> 20:23.570
<i>And if that</i>
<i>doesn't give you</i>

20:23.638 --> 20:25.539
any more inspiration,
I don't know what will.

20:25.607 --> 20:27.741
I'm hoping I'm just gonna
be able to bring my "A" game

20:27.809 --> 20:29.843
and those guys
are gonna be like, "wow,

20:29.911 --> 20:31.845
"there's the next guy that's
gonna be running L.A. Market."

20:31.913 --> 20:33.681
Okay.
Back inside.

20:33.748 --> 20:36.583
To see the winners, that
just reminds me why I'm here.

20:36.651 --> 20:37.885
And I need to step up my game.

20:37.952 --> 20:39.486
I've watched every season.

20:39.554 --> 20:41.088
Damn, that made me
teary-eyed, man.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.511
Let's go.

20:42.684 --> 20:44.494
This is a big night on a lot of scales.

20:45.193 --> 20:47.361
I don't wanna disappoint
Ramsay tonight, man.

20:49.464 --> 20:50.698
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>James.</i>
Yes, Chef.

20:50.765 --> 20:52.332
<i>Thought I'd never say this,</i>

20:52.400 --> 20:54.134
but open Hell's Kitchen
for the 100th service.

20:54.202 --> 20:55.636
Chef.

21:06.648 --> 21:08.982
(Announcer)
For tonight's centennial
dinner service,

21:09.050 --> 21:12.019
Chef Ramsay has created
an evening of elegance

21:12.087 --> 21:13.654
with a menu to match.

21:13.722 --> 21:15.089
Oysters rockefeller, please.

21:15.156 --> 21:17.024
I'm going to do
the Wellington.

21:17.092 --> 21:18.625
Welcome
to Hell's Kitchen.

21:18.693 --> 21:20.427
(Announcer)
As Sabrina treats each table

21:20.495 --> 21:22.262
to a welcoming taste
of caviar,

21:22.330 --> 21:25.165
both kitchens get started
on their first tickets.

21:25.233 --> 21:26.867
One oyster, two capellini,
two risotto, yes?

21:26.935 --> 21:27.768
Yes, Chef.
<i>How long?</i>

21:27.836 --> 21:29.303
Eight minutes, Chef.

21:29.370 --> 21:30.971
Capellini takes three minutes
to cook.

21:31.039 --> 21:32.606
Let's make that five.
We can make that five.

21:32.674 --> 21:33.941
Make that five minutes, Chef.
Risotto.

21:34.008 --> 21:35.676
Risotto doesn't take
eight minutes ever.

21:35.744 --> 21:36.910
The weakest team member
is Boris.

21:36.978 --> 21:38.345
Well, I'm gonna get
your capellini, go ahead.

21:38.413 --> 21:39.713
Yeah,
I got the capellini here.

21:39.781 --> 21:41.148
Let me do it, please.
Let me do it, man.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.117
Yeah, I saw Boris
dying quickly.

21:43.184 --> 21:46.587
I knew if I didn't help him,
he was gonna be in the [Bleep].

21:46.654 --> 21:49.790
We need some fast appetizers
flying out of the kitchen, man.

21:49.858 --> 21:51.859
No, you need to cook that pasta
a little bit more.
It's going.

21:51.926 --> 21:52.559
<i>Let's go,</i>
<i>i need the pasta.</i>

21:52.627 --> 21:54.595
Yes, Chef.

21:54.662 --> 21:56.597
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>
<i>The capellini okay?</i>

21:56.664 --> 21:58.332
Yeah.
Yeah, quite nice, actually.

21:58.399 --> 21:59.666
Let's go. Pick up.
Okay, let's go, Boris.

21:59.734 --> 22:01.034
Here we go, yeah?

22:01.102 --> 22:02.369
<i>Two oysters,</i>
<i>one capellini,</i>

22:02.437 --> 22:03.871
one risotto,
one truffle salad.

22:03.938 --> 22:05.873
No. Give me six minutes
on that, please.

22:05.940 --> 22:07.741
Get it working first, then,
before the oysters,

22:07.809 --> 22:09.810
'cause the oysters
don't take as long.

22:09.878 --> 22:11.612
(Announcer)
While Russell continues
to keep a close eye on Boris,

22:11.679 --> 22:13.680
the red team looks to Nona
to get them off

22:13.748 --> 22:15.349
to a good start
on appetizers.

22:15.416 --> 22:16.683
Two risotto,
two truffle salad, easy.

22:16.751 --> 22:19.119
The success of tonight
all rides on my shoulders,

22:19.187 --> 22:21.488
since I'm on apps.

22:21.556 --> 22:22.823
I can either get us off
to a good start

22:22.891 --> 22:24.057
or blow it completely.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.359
Risotto, please,
where are they?

22:25.426 --> 22:26.927
Right here.
Service, please.

22:26.995 --> 22:28.095
I'm gonna have
a perfect, amazing service,

22:28.163 --> 22:29.630
no screwups.

22:29.697 --> 22:31.298
This was enough for three,

22:31.366 --> 22:32.966
<i>so could I use this again</i>
<i>for the next--</i>

22:33.001 --> 22:34.902
yeah, just make sure
it doesn't overcook.

22:34.969 --> 22:36.203
Why would you use a recycled
risotto in Hell's Kitchen?

22:36.271 --> 22:37.471
I don't know.

22:37.539 --> 22:38.872
Go on up
with the risotto.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.040
Rock up.

22:40.108 --> 22:42.342
Stop.
It's the same one.

22:42.410 --> 22:43.443
<i>Red team.</i>
(All)
Yes, Chef?

22:43.511 --> 22:45.345
All of you, come here.

22:45.413 --> 22:46.914
<i>We can't make</i>
<i>a fresh risotto</i>

22:46.981 --> 22:48.448
to celebrate
our 100th service?

22:48.516 --> 22:50.150
<i>Who's [Bleep] with who now?</i>

22:50.218 --> 22:52.052
Sorry, Nona,
that's completely my fault.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.554
I'm just gonna stay
in the meat station

22:53.621 --> 22:54.955
and take care
of my Wellingtons.

22:55.023 --> 22:56.056
<i>You were gonna send me that</i>
<i>[Bleep]</i>

22:56.124 --> 22:57.357
From the previous table?

22:57.425 --> 22:58.225
My customers deserve
the best.

22:58.293 --> 23:00.127
It was Gail who did it!

23:00.195 --> 23:02.496
I asked her,
and she said, "yes."

23:02.564 --> 23:04.331
Previous winners
of <i>Hell's Kitchen</i> here.

23:04.399 --> 23:06.166
Do you think they performed
like that?

23:06.234 --> 23:08.635
Okay, Nona. I don't know what
you're used to doing,

23:08.703 --> 23:10.404
but this
is Hell's Kitchen, girlfriend.

23:10.471 --> 23:11.939
You don't do
that kind of [Bleep].

23:17.045 --> 23:18.512
Why do you wanna send
the old one?
I don't know.

23:18.580 --> 23:19.079
I don't know.
Yes, Chef.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.948
Service.

23:21.015 --> 23:23.050
(Announcer)
Nona's fresh risotto
gets the stamp of approval

23:23.117 --> 23:24.651
from Chef Ramsay
and the customers.

23:24.719 --> 23:26.286
That is so good.

23:26.354 --> 23:28.188
And now, just 30 minutes
into dinner service...

23:28.256 --> 23:29.857
If you wanna come
this way...

23:29.924 --> 23:31.024
The former
<i>Hell's Kitchen</i> winners

23:31.092 --> 23:32.793
are ready to take
their seats.

23:32.861 --> 23:34.761
But first, they take a trip
down memory lane.

23:34.829 --> 23:36.496
May bring back
some old memories.

23:36.564 --> 23:38.532
Look, there you are.

23:38.600 --> 23:42.002
[Cheers and applause]

23:42.070 --> 23:44.171
Is that you crying?
Yes.

23:44.239 --> 23:45.739
[Crying]

23:45.807 --> 23:47.741
I know.

23:47.809 --> 23:49.843
Me on the big night.
This whole cake is crying.

23:49.911 --> 23:52.579
Yeah!
What? What?

23:52.647 --> 23:54.248
Yes, sir!

23:54.315 --> 23:57.251
These are great.
I love it.

23:57.318 --> 23:59.086
Mommy! Mommy!
I won!

23:59.153 --> 24:01.088
I love you, mama.

24:01.155 --> 24:03.156
(Announcer)
With the memories
of their triumphs

24:03.224 --> 24:04.892
still fresh in their minds...
Enjoy your meal.

24:04.959 --> 24:06.593
(Announcer)
These champions
are looking forward

24:06.661 --> 24:07.928
to a Hell's Kitchen
experience...

24:07.996 --> 24:08.929
Welcome to Chef's table.
Take their order.

24:08.997 --> 24:10.631
Of a different kind.

24:10.698 --> 24:12.366
The beef Wellington,
medium rare.

24:12.433 --> 24:13.867
Two oysters,
one capellini,

24:13.935 --> 24:15.302
one risotto,
one truffle salad.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.403
<i>Why is the risotto</i>
<i>not even on?</i>

24:16.471 --> 24:18.405
Putting it on
right now, Chef.

24:18.473 --> 24:19.873
Is the capellini in?
Yes, Chef,
the capellini's in.

24:19.941 --> 24:21.808
So what takes longest?
The risotto, Chef.

24:21.876 --> 24:22.910
<i>The risotto?</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

24:22.977 --> 24:24.144
Don't just stand there.

24:24.212 --> 24:25.779
Don't do this to me
tonight!

24:25.847 --> 24:27.080
<i>No Chef, no Chef.</i>

24:27.148 --> 24:28.282
Get the [Bleep] Risotto
on first.

24:28.349 --> 24:29.349
Yes, Chef.

24:29.417 --> 24:30.851
<i>Whoa.</i>

24:30.919 --> 24:32.552
I'm gonna go
[Bleep] Ballistic.

24:32.620 --> 24:34.421
Get a grip!

24:34.489 --> 24:36.290
And I have my own things
to do right now,

24:36.357 --> 24:38.191
but let me tell you,
if I don't help Boris,

24:38.259 --> 24:39.927
my [Bleep] Is never gonna
make it out.

24:39.994 --> 24:41.762
Stop panicking.
Yes, Chef.

24:41.829 --> 24:42.963
Just [Bleep] Focus.

24:43.031 --> 24:44.331
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

24:44.399 --> 24:46.199
I got it.
It's burning up.

24:46.267 --> 24:47.701
[Bleep] Slow death over here.
Boris, what's the holdup?

24:47.769 --> 24:49.670
Uh, I'm working on it.

24:49.737 --> 24:51.772
Boris is a brain-dead
dumb [Bleep].

24:51.839 --> 24:53.874
I think it's ridiculous
how slow the apps were taking.

24:53.942 --> 24:56.543
Coming up
to the pass, Chef.

24:56.611 --> 24:58.178
Yeah, I like Boris.
<i>Service, please.</i>

24:58.246 --> 24:59.713
(Announcer)
With Rob's help,

24:59.781 --> 25:01.515
Boris' appetizers
have left the kitchen.

25:01.582 --> 25:03.617
That's amazing.
<i>How is it?</i>

25:03.685 --> 25:05.185
Wonderful.

25:05.253 --> 25:06.954
[Laughter]

25:07.021 --> 25:08.655
(Announcer)
And the men move on to entrees.

25:08.723 --> 25:09.990
On order, table 22.

25:10.058 --> 25:11.358
Entree, easy.

25:11.426 --> 25:12.559
<i>Three lobster,</i>
<i>two Wellington.</i>

25:12.627 --> 25:14.061
(All)
Yes, Chef.

25:14.128 --> 25:15.762
<i>(Woman)</i>
<i>Hey.</i>
Hey, folks.

25:15.830 --> 25:19.032
[Laughs]
That's my guy.
That's my guy.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.801
(Announcer)
In the red kitchen,

25:20.868 --> 25:22.302
Nona has done a masterful job
on appetizers.

25:22.370 --> 25:23.437
Enjoy.

25:23.504 --> 25:24.905
Thank you.

25:24.973 --> 25:26.406
(Announcer)
And so both kitchens

25:26.474 --> 25:28.241
are off
to a respectable start.

25:28.309 --> 25:30.243
Two salmon, two chicken,
two Wellington.
2 1/2 to the window.

25:30.311 --> 25:31.545
How long on your garnish?
I'm ready to go.

25:31.612 --> 25:33.180
I'm ready.

25:33.247 --> 25:35.449
I've worked garnish myself,
and I didn't need anybody

25:35.516 --> 25:37.351
to cover me
before I rocked it out.

25:37.418 --> 25:38.685
I know all the recipes
like the back of my hand.

25:38.753 --> 25:40.420
Ready to walk?
No.

25:40.488 --> 25:42.055
<i>You just said, "ready."</i>
I didn't say, "ready."

25:42.123 --> 25:43.457
<i>How long?</i>

25:43.524 --> 25:45.292
I gotta make the ragout
real quick.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.293
It doesn't come with ragout.
It's salmon.

25:47.929 --> 25:49.997
I don't know
what Trev's problem is.

25:50.064 --> 25:51.798
I'm helping him
on the garnish,

25:51.866 --> 25:54.001
and this dude has no clue
what's going on.

25:54.068 --> 25:56.069
The gnocchi's are falling
the [Bleep] Apart.

25:56.137 --> 25:57.404
<i>(Jillian)</i>
<i>You got your squash?</i>

25:57.472 --> 25:58.705
The squash is right here.

25:58.773 --> 26:00.073
You gotta
throw it in, man.

26:00.141 --> 26:01.375
You gotta melt
the sage on it.

26:01.442 --> 26:02.809
I'm doing it
right now, Jill.

26:02.877 --> 26:04.411
Get some butter
in that gnocchi pan.

26:04.479 --> 26:06.013
Trevor's starting to get
in the weeds.

26:06.080 --> 26:08.415
He's falling behind,
and he's sinking us.

26:08.483 --> 26:10.283
25 seconds out.
Can I slice my Wellington?

26:10.351 --> 26:11.685
<i>(Trev)</i>
<i>Slice.</i>

26:11.753 --> 26:13.286
I'm waiting on the gnocchi,
that's it.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.122
Your butternut squash
isn't even in yet.

26:15.189 --> 26:16.556
<i>Is that going with it?</i>
<i>Yes, it's going with it.</i>

26:16.624 --> 26:17.691
Okay.

26:17.759 --> 26:19.493
I'm trying, man.

26:19.560 --> 26:21.628
I'm really, really
[Bleep] Trying.
Drive it, Gail.

26:21.696 --> 26:23.964
Yes, Chef. Walking up
right now--two Wellingtons.

26:24.032 --> 26:25.665
Gail.
<i>Yes, Chef?</i>

26:25.733 --> 26:27.667
They're perfectly cooked now.
Yes, Chef.

26:27.735 --> 26:29.136
You've raised the bar now.
You stay above it, yes?

26:29.203 --> 26:30.303
Yes, Chef.
Garnish, Trevor.

26:30.371 --> 26:31.671
Gnocchi's coming.
Come on, Trevor!

26:31.739 --> 26:35.208
Two chicken walking up.
Gnocchi inside.

26:39.213 --> 26:41.014
All here.
Yes, Chef.

26:41.082 --> 26:43.350
At night is this?
What [Bleep] night is this?

26:43.418 --> 26:44.918
Important night of the year.

26:44.986 --> 26:46.720
Yeah,
the most important night.

26:46.788 --> 26:48.121
Is that the most important
gnocchi you've cooked?

26:48.189 --> 26:49.589
No, it's not.
[bleep] Off with you.

26:49.657 --> 26:50.891
<i>Man, come on, Trev.</i>
What is that?

26:50.958 --> 26:52.759
That looks like
a big-ass booger.

26:52.827 --> 26:54.428
Oh, my God.

26:54.495 --> 26:55.829
Wake up, Trevor!

26:55.897 --> 26:57.297
<i>Nothing's coming out...</i>

26:57.365 --> 26:59.666
On a night like tonight!

26:59.734 --> 27:01.701
Wake up!

27:04.115 --> 27:07.785
(Announcer)
Hell's Kitchen celebrates
its 100th dinner service.

27:09.710 --> 27:12.212
You don't know [Bleep]!
Let me do my job!

27:12.280 --> 27:14.748
Don't you dare turn around and
tell me that I'm [Bleep] brap,

27:14.815 --> 27:16.583
or you [Bleep] off
through those doors.

27:16.651 --> 27:19.119
You can dish it,
but you can't take it?

27:19.187 --> 27:21.121
What are you doing?
Just let me in the kitchen.

27:21.189 --> 27:22.756
Shut your fat [Bleep] mouth
and listen to me.

27:22.823 --> 27:24.658
I'm trying to learn
from you.

27:24.725 --> 27:26.293
You're not learning.
You're running your fat mouth.

27:26.360 --> 27:27.794
I am--
shut up, then.

27:27.862 --> 27:29.429
Shut up.

27:29.497 --> 27:31.731
Are you gonna keep it shut?

27:31.799 --> 27:32.933
Shut.
Good.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.768
But if you can't hack it,
[Bleep] Off.

27:34.835 --> 27:36.336
If you can,
get back in there.

27:36.404 --> 27:38.305
Get off my station,
please!

27:43.811 --> 27:45.645
(Announcer)
It's just over an hour

27:45.713 --> 27:47.047
into Hell's Kitchen's
100th dinner service.

27:47.114 --> 27:48.248
All of you, come here.

27:48.316 --> 27:49.616
And Trev's gnocchi...

27:49.684 --> 27:51.518
What the [Bleep] Is that?

27:51.586 --> 27:54.087
(Announcer)
Has brought the red tandstill.

27:54.155 --> 27:55.488
Is that the most important
gnocchi you've cooked?

27:55.556 --> 27:56.523
No, it's not.

27:56.591 --> 27:57.991
Oh, [Bleep] Off with you.

27:58.059 --> 28:00.961
It looks like pancakes.

28:01.028 --> 28:02.629
He says
he's great on garnish,

28:02.697 --> 28:04.164
and then he completely
lost his footing.

28:04.232 --> 28:06.166
Slow down, yeah,
and work with your mind.

28:06.234 --> 28:08.001
Slow down!
Yes, Chef.

28:08.069 --> 28:09.869
(Announcer)
Trev's problems on garnish

28:09.937 --> 28:11.271
have yet to be felt
in the dining room,

28:11.339 --> 28:13.240
as the red diners
seem to be very pleased.

28:13.307 --> 28:15.642
The Wellington
is quite wonderful.

28:15.710 --> 28:17.611
(Announcer)
However, there is one diner
on the blue side...

28:17.678 --> 28:19.079
How is everything
this evening?

28:19.146 --> 28:20.380
Uh, the lobster's
really chewy.

28:20.448 --> 28:22.515
<i>Do you want</i>
<i>to send it back?</i>

28:22.583 --> 28:24.184
(Announcer)
Who's feeling just the opposite.

28:24.252 --> 28:25.719
What's the matter, James?
Their lobster.

28:26.887 --> 28:28.255
Vinny.

28:28.322 --> 28:30.223
Yes, Chef.
Lobster's chewy.

28:30.291 --> 28:32.292
Yeah, I heated the lobster up
a little bit too much.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.127
No problem.
The rest of them will be fine.

28:34.195 --> 28:35.996
It tastes like peanuts,
like I'm biting into peanuts.

28:36.063 --> 28:37.597
<i>Yeah, they're</i>
<i>very crunchy.</i>

28:37.665 --> 28:39.165
So let me see
what I can do.

28:39.233 --> 28:40.433
Thank you so much.
I'm so sorry.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.269
That's all right.
No, we're so sorry.

28:42.336 --> 28:44.037
<i>Oh, no, come on.</i>
Same table.

28:47.842 --> 28:50.043
All three of them chewy.
What the [Bleep]?

28:50.111 --> 28:51.911
Do you wanna argue
with them?
No.

28:51.979 --> 28:53.813
You gotta be [Bleep] Me
with this, man.

28:53.881 --> 28:54.881
So all he had to do
was reheat the thing

28:54.949 --> 28:56.349
for a minute and a half.

28:56.417 --> 28:57.150
<i>Vin, stay focused, buddy,</i>
<i>come on.</i>

28:57.218 --> 28:58.151
Let's go!

28:58.219 --> 28:59.986
Poor Vinny.

29:00.054 --> 29:01.855
(Announcer)
While Vinny starts over
on his roasted lobster,

29:01.922 --> 29:03.256
in the red kitchen,

29:03.324 --> 29:04.691
Jillian's lobster
is ready to go.

29:04.759 --> 29:06.526
She's just waiting for...

29:06.594 --> 29:09.162
My lobster's up,
and you have no garnish.

29:09.230 --> 29:10.597
Get off my ass
and let me cook.

29:13.601 --> 29:17.070
Yeah.
What do you need, Trev?

29:17.138 --> 29:18.805
Trev sucks.
Dude, are you stoned?

29:18.873 --> 29:21.308
Ke, did you smoke a fat joint
before you came in here?

29:21.375 --> 29:23.610
Trev, oh, you can't serve those
carrots--they're burned, man.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.378
Why don't you [Bleep] Fix it?
I am, you [Bleep].

29:25.446 --> 29:27.414
Help me!
Don't [Bleep] Get on my ass.

29:27.481 --> 29:28.748
Help me.

29:28.816 --> 29:30.850
God, he is so stupid.

29:30.918 --> 29:32.185
<i>Does anybody need</i>
<i>any help right now?</i>

29:32.253 --> 29:33.853
I'm good on apps.

29:33.921 --> 29:35.455
I could use a hand over here,
definitely.

29:35.523 --> 29:36.956
<i>Where's your, uh, shallots?</i>

29:37.024 --> 29:39.793
'S on the garnish?
One, two, three of you.

29:39.860 --> 29:41.261
Sabrina on garnish,
Nona on garnish.

29:41.329 --> 29:43.196
<i>Trev, what are you doing?</i>

29:43.264 --> 29:44.898
Working it, Chef.
<i>Gail.</i>

29:44.965 --> 29:46.966
Go over there on garnish
as well--you might as well.

29:47.034 --> 29:49.936
I've never seen Chef Ramsay
call over the entire kitchen

29:50.004 --> 29:51.438
to help one person.

29:51.505 --> 29:52.839
Ridiculous.

29:52.907 --> 29:54.741
The squash is burning.
What's going on?

29:54.809 --> 29:56.409
The squash is what?
Hold it.

29:56.477 --> 29:58.678
Burning?
<i>I need some more shallots.</i>

29:58.746 --> 30:01.748
(Announcer)
It's all hands on deck
on Trev's garnish station.

30:01.816 --> 30:03.750
Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...
Service.

30:03.818 --> 30:06.553
Vinny has finally cooked
his lobster properly.

30:06.620 --> 30:08.455
I'm really happy
with this lobster.

30:08.522 --> 30:10.256
<i>Are you sweaty yet?</i>

30:10.324 --> 30:12.859
Serve the V.I.P. table.
Just go, don't drip in it.

30:12.927 --> 30:15.095
(Announcer)
Now it's time
for Boris to shine.

30:15.162 --> 30:16.996
I have so much respect for you
guys for going through this.

30:17.064 --> 30:18.598
Hurry up, Boris.
Serve it, yeah?

30:18.666 --> 30:19.999
You guys enjoy
your Wellington.

30:20.067 --> 30:21.401
<i>Away now.</i>

30:21.469 --> 30:22.836
Two chicken, one Wellington,
one lobster.

30:22.903 --> 30:24.437
Yes, Chef.
<i>Let's go.</i>

30:24.505 --> 30:27.240
I need an all-day on Wellington.
I need an all-day on chicken.

30:27.308 --> 30:29.576
Tell me what I need.
Just a Wellington, right?

30:29.643 --> 30:32.345
Russell just
wasn't answering me, man.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.913
He was not communicating
with me.

30:33.981 --> 30:35.682
No one's helping me here.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.250
He asked for all-day
on Wellingtons

30:37.318 --> 30:38.952
they didn't give it
to him yet.

30:39.019 --> 30:41.221
Nobody's [Bleep] helping me
with the call.

30:41.288 --> 30:44.591
Rob, if you're that fat
and you can't walk five steps

30:44.658 --> 30:46.659
up to the pass
and see what you have on order,

30:46.727 --> 30:48.361
my mouth is closed.

30:48.429 --> 30:50.263
Talk to me, Russell.
Someone's gotta talk to me.

30:50.331 --> 30:51.231
I mean, I can't get
every entree in my head.

30:51.298 --> 30:52.732
Someone help me.

30:52.800 --> 30:53.867
Two chicken, one Wellington,
one lobster.

30:53.934 --> 30:55.435
How long?

30:55.503 --> 30:57.070
I need about eight minutes,
Chef.
Why?

30:57.138 --> 30:58.304
I'm dragging
on the chicken, Chef.

30:58.372 --> 31:00.039
Did you forget it?

31:00.107 --> 31:02.809
I missed it on the ticket,
Chef, yes.
[bleep].

31:02.877 --> 31:04.177
I never heard him say
anything about chicken.

31:04.245 --> 31:05.845
Ty pissed,

31:05.913 --> 31:07.380
because Russell
definitely could've helped.

31:07.448 --> 31:09.048
He's making the [Bleep]
Garnish for it

31:09.116 --> 31:10.617
and not letting me know
[Bleep].

31:10.684 --> 31:12.085
You just brought the kitchen
to a standstill.

31:12.153 --> 31:13.653
I'm dragging chicken, Chef.

31:13.721 --> 31:16.623
On a [Bleep] Night
like tonight.

31:16.690 --> 31:19.359
(Announcer)
Rob's oversight would be
a problem on any night.

31:19.427 --> 31:22.128
But with a dining room packed
with V.I.P.s and critics

31:22.196 --> 31:24.297
for the 100th dinner service,

31:24.365 --> 31:25.965
tonight's mistake
is magnified.

31:26.033 --> 31:27.700
I noticed other people
have gotten their--

31:27.768 --> 31:29.202
their food already.

31:29.270 --> 31:31.271
Yeah.
They're out of food.

31:31.338 --> 31:32.839
(Announcer)
Meanwhile,
there's a disturbing pattern

31:32.907 --> 31:33.873
continuing in the red kitchen.

31:33.941 --> 31:35.074
Here you are.

31:35.142 --> 31:36.943
Thank you.
Enjoy.

31:37.011 --> 31:39.245
(Announcer)
The women are able
to push out entrees,

31:39.313 --> 31:40.513
but Trev...
<i>Three broccolini,</i>
<i>one squash, I'm dying.</i>

31:40.581 --> 31:42.382
He's unable to deliver
his garnish on time.

31:42.450 --> 31:44.350
Three broccolini,
one squash.

31:44.418 --> 31:46.953
One squash is in.
Where's the [Bleep] Broccolini?

31:47.021 --> 31:48.721
<i>Come on, Trev.</i>

31:48.789 --> 31:50.824
You have to put the basket down,
or it's gonna stick.

31:50.891 --> 31:52.425
Nona.
Yes, Chef.

31:52.493 --> 31:54.160
Give me three broccolini.
Hey, you, come here.

31:54.228 --> 31:55.595
<i>I haven't sent</i>
<i>one garnish out</i>

31:55.663 --> 31:57.330
at the same [Bleep] Time.

31:57.398 --> 31:59.065
I haven't sent them out yet.
Do me a favor.

31:59.133 --> 32:01.468
[Bleep] Off
and get some fresh air.

32:01.535 --> 32:03.336
I'm pissed at myself,
'cause I'm supposed

32:03.404 --> 32:04.904
to be the
guy that can do anything.

32:04.972 --> 32:07.006
I feel like [Bleep],
because I'm letting them down.

32:07.074 --> 32:09.342
They expected me to be superman,
and Clark Kent showed up.

32:09.410 --> 32:11.544
(Announcer)
While the man of the hour
takes a breather,

32:11.612 --> 32:13.446
the women in the red kitchen
take control.

32:13.514 --> 32:15.114
I'm dragging
three broccolini

32:15.182 --> 32:17.116
and I'm dragging
one squash, yes?

32:17.184 --> 32:18.952
Yes, Chef.
<i>Where is the sage?</i>

32:19.019 --> 32:23.056
It's in that deli cup
to the right of the olive oil.

32:23.123 --> 32:24.791
I don't know,
paint his nails.

32:24.859 --> 32:27.360
When I,
it's just a disaster area.

32:27.428 --> 32:29.028
God, he's got [Bleep]
Everywhere.

32:29.096 --> 32:33.633
Come on, guys,
let's push this out.

32:33.701 --> 32:35.535
<i>And we are rocking it out</i>
<i>on those stations.</i>

32:35.603 --> 32:37.103
That chicken is sexy.

32:37.171 --> 32:38.805
Sexy chicken,
coming to the window.

32:38.873 --> 32:40.073
Right behind you.

32:40.140 --> 32:41.674
(Announcer)
With Trev gone,

32:41.742 --> 32:43.610
entrees are flying
out of the red kitchen.

32:43.677 --> 32:45.712
Go, please, lobster.
It's nice, that lobster. Go.

32:45.779 --> 32:49.115
It's delicious.
It's really nice.

32:49.183 --> 32:50.950
(Announcer)
As for the blue team...

32:51.018 --> 32:52.352
Two chicken, one Wellington,
one lobster.

32:52.419 --> 32:54.654
The forgotten chicken,
how long?

32:54.722 --> 32:56.756
(Announcer)
Let's just say they are
struggling to find their groove.

32:56.824 --> 32:58.458
I need four minutes
on that, Chef.
Hey, look at me.

32:58.526 --> 33:00.393
They've got one ticket
to send.

33:00.461 --> 33:04.130
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine tables!

33:04.198 --> 33:07.600
'Cause you forgot
the chicken!

33:07.668 --> 33:09.602
I'm not this behind
'cause of one chicken.

33:09.670 --> 33:11.738
Absolutely no way.
<i>Let's go, Rob. Come on.</i>

33:11.805 --> 33:13.573
<i>How long?</i>
I'e minute.

33:13.641 --> 33:14.841
<i>How about you?</i>
One minute.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.876
Rob only had two dishes.

33:16.944 --> 33:18.478
I was literally
at his mercy tonight.

33:18.546 --> 33:19.746
Just give me another
two minutes.

33:19.813 --> 33:21.180
[Bleep].

33:21.248 --> 33:23.082
You told me to go, bro.

33:23.150 --> 33:24.851
<i>I didn't tell you to go.</i>
You just said, "one minute."

33:24.919 --> 33:26.386
I can't give you
two more minutes.

33:26.453 --> 33:27.554
There's no Grace
on a lobster tail.

33:27.621 --> 33:29.556
<i>Vinny, where's the lobster?</i>

33:29.623 --> 33:30.890
You have to give me
accurate timing.

33:30.958 --> 33:34.160
Chef, up to the pass.

33:35.396 --> 33:36.596
How's it cooked?

33:36.664 --> 33:38.164
Oh, it's cooked,
all right.

33:38.232 --> 33:39.465
<i>Half of it's mush</i>
<i>on the outside,</i>

33:39.533 --> 33:42.201
and then the center's
well done.

33:42.269 --> 33:43.202
Uh-oh.

33:43.270 --> 33:45.171
On a night like tonight.

33:45.239 --> 33:47.674
You keep me dragging
for the chicken.

33:47.741 --> 33:49.609
You keep me dragging
for the appetizers.

33:49.677 --> 33:51.844
Then Vinny sends me this.

33:51.912 --> 33:53.646
I'll fix it.

33:53.714 --> 33:54.847
"I'll fix it."

33:54.915 --> 33:56.282
Down in a heap

33:56.350 --> 33:58.084
like a California mudslide.

33:58.152 --> 33:59.118
Chicken.

33:59.186 --> 34:00.687
<i>Going up with the chicken?</i>

34:00.754 --> 34:05.091
<i>It's pink.</i>

34:05.159 --> 34:06.259
<i>All of you, come here.</i>

34:07.494 --> 34:09.661
Oh, no.

34:09.730 --> 34:12.331
Oh, it's [Bleep] Chicken, Rob.

34:12.399 --> 34:15.368
Pink. Pink.
Don't dare touch it.

34:15.436 --> 34:17.469
Pink, pink.

34:17.538 --> 34:18.571
<i>All of you.</i>

34:18.639 --> 34:20.940
What are we doing here?

34:25.079 --> 34:26.746
Get out!

34:26.813 --> 34:28.815
Get out of here.

34:28.882 --> 34:32.217
Get out!

34:34.418 --> 34:38.054
(Announcer)
Hell's Kitchen celebrates
its 100th dier service.

34:40.527 --> 34:42.328
Leave it!

34:42.396 --> 34:43.831
[Bleep].
What is that?

34:43.917 --> 34:45.083
Look at it.
It's on fire.

34:45.152 --> 34:46.319
I don't know.

34:46.386 --> 34:48.120
She was lost.

34:48.188 --> 34:51.157
[Feigns crying] "I don't know
what's going on here."

34:51.225 --> 34:52.692
What's the matter
with you?

34:52.759 --> 34:53.726
I can't cook meat,
Chef!

34:53.793 --> 34:56.762
Madame, get out!

35:01.602 --> 35:04.871
(Announcer)
Two hours into the milestone
100th dinner service...

35:04.938 --> 35:06.873
Hey, come here, all of you.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.741
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay's high hopes
for excellence

35:08.809 --> 35:10.977
are being crushed by the
blue team's weak performance.

35:11.044 --> 35:12.144
Pink chicken.

35:12.212 --> 35:13.679
And Rob's undercooked chicken

35:13.747 --> 35:15.381
pushes Chef Ramsay
over the edge.

35:15.449 --> 35:17.550
Get out!

35:17.618 --> 35:20.453
(Announcer)
And now the men of the blue team
are out of the kitchen

35:20.521 --> 35:22.321
just like the lone man
on the red team.

35:22.389 --> 35:24.524
Get back in there.
He doesn't wanna win.

35:24.591 --> 35:26.292
What am I gonna do,
just walk away

35:26.360 --> 35:27.593
and leave them sitting there
by themselves?

35:27.661 --> 35:29.128
I don't have a [Bleep] Choice.

35:29.196 --> 35:30.730
It's either get over it,
or else just go home.

35:30.797 --> 35:32.064
Are you ready?

35:32.132 --> 35:33.900
Yes, Chef.
You can be pissed off.

35:33.967 --> 35:35.434
Just wake up!
Yes, Chef.

35:35.502 --> 35:36.369
That's all!
Chef, where are we at?

35:36.436 --> 35:38.104
The last table.

35:38.171 --> 35:40.139
We don't need any boys
on our team.
Let's do it.

35:40.207 --> 35:41.874
Walking to the window
with the Wellington.

35:41.942 --> 35:42.808
By the time Trevor
came back...

35:42.876 --> 35:44.243
Squash to the window.

35:44.311 --> 35:45.611
We were finished
with service.

35:45.679 --> 35:47.446
Service, please.

35:47.514 --> 35:49.549
(Announcer)
After the red team
successfully completed

35:49.616 --> 35:51.717
their halfining room...
Thank you.

35:51.785 --> 35:53.519
They went on to feed
the remaining customers

35:53.587 --> 35:54.587
on the blue side...

35:54.655 --> 35:56.289
Great.

35:56.356 --> 35:58.057
(Announcer)
Salvaging the evening
for Chef Ramsay.

35:58.125 --> 35:59.158
Jillian.
Yes, Chef.

35:59.226 --> 36:00.693
Perfectly cooked.

36:00.761 --> 36:02.728
To do well while I have

36:02.796 --> 36:04.430
previous
<i>Hell's Kitchen</i> winners

36:04.498 --> 36:06.532
in my kitchen,
that just makes me so happy.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.200
I just wanted to say
you guys are awesome,

36:08.268 --> 36:09.368
and you're my inspiration.

36:09.436 --> 36:11.270
Thank you, ladies.

36:13.974 --> 36:15.541
Uh, ladies.
Clearly, you won tonight.

36:15.609 --> 36:17.410
Uh, Trevor.
Absolute disaster.

36:17.477 --> 36:19.845
<i>Ladies, great job.</i>
Thank you, Chef.

36:19.913 --> 36:21.647
Well done.
Trev--[Scoffs]

36:23.450 --> 36:25.685
Whoo-hoo! Kicking ass
and taking names.

36:25.752 --> 36:27.620
We're loving this winning streak
that we're on.

36:29.623 --> 36:30.623
Gentlemen,

36:30.691 --> 36:32.325
<i>clearly, you lost.</i>

36:32.392 --> 36:35.161
Each and every one of you
were embarrassing.

36:35.228 --> 36:36.629
<i>Do me a big favor.</i>

36:36.697 --> 36:38.264
Think of two nominees
and hurry up.

36:38.332 --> 36:39.532
Yes, Chef.

36:42.669 --> 36:44.737
I s doing everything
I could tonight.

36:44.805 --> 36:46.138
And, you know, at the end
of the day, it wasn't enough.

36:46.206 --> 36:47.340
These guys didn't pull
their weight.

36:47.407 --> 36:48.808
Give your nominees and why.

36:48.875 --> 36:50.676
I don't know how to vote.
We all suck.

36:50.744 --> 36:52.645
And I think
that's pretty clear.

36:52.713 --> 36:54.547
[All cheering]

36:54.615 --> 36:56.182
He said,
"ladies, well done.

36:56.249 --> 36:57.817
Trev--"[Scoffs]

36:57.884 --> 37:01.621
We won, and we didn't even need
Trevor's stupid ass.

37:01.688 --> 37:05.057
[Laughter]

37:05.125 --> 37:07.827
It's not funny, man.
[sarcastically] Ha ha.

37:07.894 --> 37:10.463
I felt like I was
left out to dry tonight.

37:10.530 --> 37:12.498
<i>(Jillian)</i>
<i>Just make sure you do better</i>
<i>next time, you know?</i>

37:12.566 --> 37:14.100
It didn't help
that I got two people

37:14.167 --> 37:16.335
on my own team
screaming at me.

37:16.403 --> 37:17.970
You weren't trying
to help me out.

37:18.038 --> 37:20.206
You were trying to be
a bitch.
Ooh.

37:20.273 --> 37:22.475
<i>(Sabrina)</i>

<i>Stop. For real.</i>

37:28.882 --> 37:30.816
<i>We cannot fall apart</i>

all right?

37:32.052 --> 37:34.587
<i>Let it go, Trev.</i>

37:34.655 --> 37:36.288
First vote
for Boris...
Of course.

37:36.356 --> 37:37.990
Because the slow start.
And my second vote--

37:38.058 --> 37:40.026
I'm just gonna
try to keep it real,

37:40.093 --> 37:42.194
and I got to vote for Vinny,
'cause of the send-backs.

37:42.262 --> 37:44.096
Russ, you voted for me.

37:44.164 --> 37:46.265
I'm voting for you,
and I'm voting for Rob.

37:46.333 --> 37:48.434
Boris, I had to slide over
to help you get your apps out.

37:48.502 --> 37:49.735
<i>For that reason,</i>
<i>i vote you.</i>

37:49.803 --> 37:51.504
And secondly, I think Vinny

37:51.571 --> 37:53.906
had the second-worst service
tonight just based on lobster.

37:53.974 --> 37:55.641
I'm voting for Rob,
because you have to give me

37:55.709 --> 37:56.976
accurate times.

37:57.044 --> 37:59.011
I was yelling
them, vin.

37:59.079 --> 38:00.846
<i>I was yelling them</i>
<i>out, man.</i>
You did not.

38:00.914 --> 38:02.748
He was giving me,
like, off times the whole night.

38:02.816 --> 38:04.150
Rob tanked me tonight

38:04.217 --> 38:05.317
and doesn't even realize
he did.

38:05.385 --> 38:06.585
Okay, so me
and who else?

38:06.653 --> 38:08.754
I'm gonna pick Boris,

38:08.822 --> 38:11.724
only 'cause Russell didn't
[Bleep] Me at all tonight.

38:11.792 --> 38:13.325
<i>So that's Boris,</i>
<i>and then it's tied--</i>

38:13.393 --> 38:14.694
two for Vinny,
two for Rob.

38:14.761 --> 38:16.696
I have three votes.
Yes.

38:16.763 --> 38:18.864
You have three,

<i>(Vinny)</i>
<i>What are we gonna do</i>

38:20.067 --> 38:22.234

I have no clue.

Oh, my God.

38:33.880 --> 38:36.015
Tonight should've been
a dream.

38:36.083 --> 38:38.217

<i>Rob...</i>
Yes, Chef.

38:39.219 --> 38:40.453
First nominee and why?

38:40.520 --> 38:43.289
The first nominee tonight,
ch.

38:43.356 --> 38:44.757
<i>We felt that Boris</i>

38:44.825 --> 38:46.192

real fast tonight.

38:46.259 --> 38:48.594
Okay, second nominee
and why?

38:48.662 --> 38:50.262
Um...

38:50.330 --> 38:52.398
<i>The next nominee was, uh...</i>

38:54.534 --> 38:56.535
Um...

38:56.603 --> 39:00.740
Rob.

39:07.826 --> 39:09.661
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay
has asked the blue team

39:09.728 --> 39:11.396
for two nominees
for elimination.

39:11.463 --> 39:13.398
And while they had
no problem naming Boris

39:13.465 --> 39:14.732
as the first nominee...

39:14.800 --> 39:16.234
Second nominee
and why?

39:16.302 --> 39:18.937
They are unable to agree
on their second.

39:19.004 --> 39:21.873
It's tied
between me and Vinny.

39:21.941 --> 39:23.508
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

39:23.576 --> 39:26.244
You can't even come together
with a simple decision.

39:26.312 --> 39:29.447
Rob, why Vinny?
Vinny's station
was dragging hard tonight.

39:29.515 --> 39:31.482
<i>He was having a hard time</i>
<i>getting lobster out,</i>

39:31.550 --> 39:32.784

Erstand

39:35.788 --> 39:37.088
<i>is his Wellingtons</i>

39:37.156 --> 39:38.456
came at the expense
of my lobster.

39:38.524 --> 39:40.792
Ooh, stop.

39:40.859 --> 39:43.328
You both screwed me
on the last four tables.

39:43.395 --> 39:46.531
Vinny, Rob, Boris...

39:46.599 --> 39:47.532
Step forward!

39:51.303 --> 39:53.304
Boris, tell me--
why do you think

39:53.372 --> 39:54.606
you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

39:54.673 --> 39:56.307
Chef, tonight I got off

39:56.375 --> 39:58.209
to a slow start, but I managed
to get everything out,

39:58.277 --> 39:59.744
and no food wasent
back to me.

39:59.812 --> 40:01.946
I don't give a [Bleep].
Tonight was a disaster.

40:02.014 --> 40:03.081
Rob.

40:03.148 --> 40:05.149
Chef, I really did
my best tonight

went as smooth as possible.

Next, Vinny.

of passion.

Unfortunately I didn't get to
see every ounce of that passion.

41:15.854 --> 41:17.088

that I can do it.

41:17.156 --> 41:18.790

a lot more difficult
than I thought it would be.
