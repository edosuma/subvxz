WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.049
Previously on...

00:02.073 --> 00:04.590
Sounds to me as if someone's
let go of his rage.

00:04.614 --> 00:07.554
Maybe I have. Well, ihaven't.

00:07.578 --> 00:10.057
Felicia took matters
into her own hands.

00:10.081 --> 00:12.319
You want me to call off
the wedding, I'll do it.

00:12.343 --> 00:14.770
I'll do whatever you want. Karl
put the ball in Susan's court...

00:14.794 --> 00:17.724
With your d.U.I. Charge,
it could get ugly.

00:17.748 --> 00:20.167
While Andrew tried
to take Bree to court...

00:20.191 --> 00:22.699
There's a father.
He's a kid!

00:22.723 --> 00:25.010
Gabrielle and Carlos took the baby...
The papers aren't valid anymore.

00:25.034 --> 00:27.504
Do you really wanna leave
this beautiful little girl

00:27.528 --> 00:29.736
with that
white trash freak show?

00:29.760 --> 00:31.260
And ran with it.

00:33.264 --> 00:37.084
Louisa pate
believed in the power of shame.

00:37.108 --> 00:38.585
As a teacher,

00:38.609 --> 00:41.017
she had found that the best way
to control unruly students

00:41.041 --> 00:44.591
was to instill
a strong sense of shame...

00:44.615 --> 00:46.293
In their parents.

00:46.317 --> 00:48.555
I left Trisha alone
with the school hamster

00:48.579 --> 00:50.279
for only five minutes.

00:52.083 --> 00:55.463
In this box
is all that's left of patches.

00:57.488 --> 01:00.537
For show and tell, Timmy decided
to bring in something

01:00.561 --> 01:04.101
from your husband's collection
of Nazi memorabilia.

01:06.237 --> 01:08.115
Billy's been threatening
to beat up the other kids

01:08.139 --> 01:09.616
for their milk money.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.640
We found the proceeds
in his cubby.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.353
Of course, Mrs. Pate also knew

01:16.377 --> 01:18.785
when it came to unruly children,

01:18.809 --> 01:22.129
some parents had more reason
to be ashamed...

01:22.153 --> 01:23.830
Than others.

01:23.854 --> 01:28.365
So, um... your message said
that Parker had been involved

01:28.389 --> 01:30.637
in some sort
of serious incident.

01:30.661 --> 01:32.068
What... what kind of incident?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.070
Yesterday afternoon,

01:34.094 --> 01:36.081
Parker offered a cookie
to Cindy Lou peeples

01:36.105 --> 01:39.176
if she would
show him her vagina.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.078
What kind of cookie?

01:42.102 --> 01:43.810
What does that matter?

01:43.834 --> 01:45.312
Oh, it doesn't.

01:45.336 --> 01:48.115
I'm just stalling because
I am completely mortified.

01:48.139 --> 01:51.118
The kids were in a broom closet.
Our janitor walked in on them

01:51.142 --> 01:54.561
just as Cindy was lifting up
her pinafore. Oh, my goodness.

01:54.585 --> 01:56.563
I'm sure you've noticed
how obsessive Parker can be.

01:56.587 --> 01:58.565
A certain subject
will catch his interest,

01:58.589 --> 02:01.168
and that's all he'll talk about
for weeks and weeks.

02:01.192 --> 02:03.530
Oh, right.
That happened with dinosaurs.

02:03.554 --> 02:05.541
Oh, yes, we all remember
his dinosaur phase.

02:05.565 --> 02:08.175
More fondly now than ever.

02:08.199 --> 02:12.239
Mm-hmm, so you think
that now he's obsessed with...

02:12.263 --> 02:14.420
What's underneath
the pinafore. Yes.

02:14.444 --> 02:17.314
Look, I think
he's just developed

02:17.338 --> 02:20.217
a normal curiosity
about the human body.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.289
You need to talk to him.

02:22.313 --> 02:24.256
Remind him what's appropriate
and what isn't.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.253
Of course. I will talk to him.

02:26.277 --> 02:28.555
I'll talk to him
till I'm blue in the face.

02:28.579 --> 02:30.657
I promise. Take care.

02:30.681 --> 02:35.302
Yes, Louisa pate believed
in the power of shame.

02:35.326 --> 02:38.535
She always believed,
when someone has that power...

02:38.559 --> 02:41.168
So, Mrs. Peeples,
you'll never guess

02:41.192 --> 02:44.179
what your daughter is willing
to do for a gingersnap.

02:44.203 --> 02:47.244
It's a shame not to use it.

02:47.268 --> 02:55.268
♪♪♪

03:30.511 --> 03:32.489
It had been six weeks

03:32.513 --> 03:35.822
since Andrew Van De Kamp
had declared war

03:35.846 --> 03:37.894
on his mother Bree.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.196
The final battle
was about to be waged

03:40.220 --> 03:42.369
at the Fairview county
courthouse.

03:42.393 --> 03:45.802
Bree knew
it was about to get bloody.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.635
What she didn't know was...

03:48.659 --> 03:51.708
The calvary was on its way...

03:51.732 --> 03:52.879
Bree?

03:52.903 --> 03:55.712
Whether she wanted them there
or not.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.983
Eleanor!

03:57.007 --> 03:59.816
Oh, thank god I found you.
This place is a maze.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.488
What are you doing here?

04:01.512 --> 04:04.996
Well, your father and I got
a call last night from Danielle,

04:05.020 --> 04:08.295
and she said that Andrew
was taking you to court.

04:08.319 --> 04:09.596
I mean,

04:09.620 --> 04:11.928
to say that we were shocked
would be an understatement.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.636
Hello, I'm Eleanor Mason,
Bree's stepmother.

04:14.660 --> 04:16.503
You're the lawyer?
We should talk.

04:16.527 --> 04:18.334
Uh, no, I'm not her lawyer.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.567
Good. The hair had me worried.

04:20.591 --> 04:23.270
Peter is mom's sponsor from a.A.

04:23.294 --> 04:25.412
Oh, sweetie!

04:25.436 --> 04:27.744
Since when are you in a.A.?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.946
It's a recent development.
Where's dad?

04:29.970 --> 04:32.279
In chambers with the judge.

04:32.303 --> 04:34.351
What?! Why?

04:34.375 --> 04:35.652
Everything is fine.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.784
The judge agreed
to a postponement.

04:37.808 --> 04:39.286
Oh, thank god!

04:39.310 --> 04:41.928
Luckily, he remembered me.
I spoke once at his law school.

04:41.952 --> 04:44.469
Pardon me, sir,
I'm your daughter's lawyer.

04:44.493 --> 04:45.962
Just so you know,

04:45.986 --> 04:48.495
we've been waiting
for this hearing for weeks,

04:48.519 --> 04:50.697
son, I've been an attorney
for 45 years.

04:50.721 --> 04:52.399
You and I both know

04:52.423 --> 04:54.980
how these cases can
turn into public spectacles.

04:55.004 --> 04:59.706
Our family is perfectly capable
of handling this in house.

04:59.730 --> 05:02.679
Dad, you don't understand.
This has gotten really ugly.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.611
That's why we're here.

05:04.635 --> 05:07.414
We're gonna put this family
back together.

05:07.438 --> 05:09.778
Whatever it takes.

05:14.845 --> 05:17.624
And that's
when Mr. and Mrs. Solis,

05:17.648 --> 05:20.026
fearing for the welfare
of this helpless child,

05:20.050 --> 05:21.628
fled the hospital.

05:21.652 --> 05:24.471
You mean, they kidnapped her.

05:24.495 --> 05:26.433
Well, technically, that's true,

05:26.457 --> 05:29.305
but given the situation
that led up to the rescue...

05:29.329 --> 05:31.638
Kidnapping.

05:31.662 --> 05:34.781
Your honor, yes, in retrospect,

05:34.805 --> 05:37.744
the plan was a little bit rash,
not entirely well thought out.

05:37.768 --> 05:38.845
Idiotic.

05:38.869 --> 05:41.448
Can we
object to that? Shh!

05:41.472 --> 05:43.450
But the childissafe, your honor.

05:43.474 --> 05:47.053
And all we ask the court
is to allow baby Lily

05:47.077 --> 05:49.926
a lifetime of the care and love

05:49.950 --> 05:52.880
she has been receiving
from the solises.

05:55.586 --> 05:58.665
As much as your story
tugs at my heart,

05:58.689 --> 06:00.737
there is the issue
of parental rights.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.709
What does the state
have to say about this?

06:02.733 --> 06:06.072
We have located
the biological father...

06:06.096 --> 06:07.574
Mr. Dale helm.

06:07.598 --> 06:10.717
Unfortunately, uh, circumstances
require that he be out of town.

06:10.741 --> 06:12.348
He's in Fort Lauderdale today.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.550
On business?

06:13.574 --> 06:15.722
Spring break, actually.

06:15.746 --> 06:17.724
Mr. Helm is
a high school student.

06:17.748 --> 06:21.528
Charming. In between keg stands,
did the father happen to mention

06:21.552 --> 06:25.432
if he plans
to waive parental rights?

06:25.456 --> 06:27.434
I've left
a number of voice mails,

06:27.458 --> 06:30.437
but the only response
I've gotten is a text message

06:30.461 --> 06:35.171
that says this "blows his mind"
and he's extremely "bummed out."

06:39.470 --> 06:41.848
All right...

06:41.872 --> 06:45.812
Mr. and Mrs. Solis,
since you actually want Lily,

06:45.836 --> 06:48.815
it seems you're
the lesser of two evils.

06:48.839 --> 06:50.957
I'm granting you
temporary custody

06:50.981 --> 06:54.390
until we can get a straight
answer from the birth father.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.423
Thank you, uh, your honor.

06:56.447 --> 06:59.566
In the meantime, try not
to steal any more babies.

06:59.590 --> 07:02.650
Oh, we just needed the one.

07:08.699 --> 07:10.977
Sweetie?

07:11.001 --> 07:13.510
Um, could you put
the crayons down for a second?

07:13.534 --> 07:15.682
We need to talk.

07:15.706 --> 07:17.183
So I spoke
to your teacher today,

07:17.207 --> 07:19.537
and she told me about the...

07:20.641 --> 07:23.790
Cookie deal
you made with Cindy Lou.

07:23.814 --> 07:26.052
Oh. Are you mad?

07:26.076 --> 07:29.556
No, not exactly.
I'm just...

07:29.580 --> 07:32.559
I'm trying to understand
why you...

07:32.583 --> 07:33.700
Did that.

07:33.724 --> 07:36.568
Tommy Keenan told me
babies come from down there.

07:36.592 --> 07:38.565
It doesn't sound right to me.

07:38.589 --> 07:40.537
Well...

07:40.561 --> 07:43.510
Actually, he's kinda right.
He's got the concept down.

07:43.534 --> 07:46.944
That's weird.
How's a baby get in there?

07:53.504 --> 07:56.491
Daddy will be home from
his business trip in a few days.

07:56.515 --> 07:58.485
Why don't you wait for him?

07:58.509 --> 08:00.909
Okay. Okay.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.631
Or I can ask Tommy's brother.

08:04.655 --> 08:08.255
He's 14,
and he knows everything.

08:10.821 --> 08:12.799
And then
the mommy and the daddy,

08:12.823 --> 08:14.950
because they love each other
so much,

08:14.974 --> 08:16.142
theyhug.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.605
Realtight.

08:18.629 --> 08:22.078
And, uh, a seed
is magically implanted.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.511
And nine months later...

08:24.535 --> 08:26.482
A baby is born. Here.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.984
What kind of seed?

08:28.008 --> 08:31.618
Oh, that's not important.

08:31.642 --> 08:33.520
I don't believe you.

08:33.544 --> 08:38.124
Parker, I'm your mother.
Mothers don't lie to their sons.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.698
Now go wash your hands

08:41.722 --> 08:44.222
or Santa's not gonna bring you
anything for Christmas.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.978
I just saw Edie drive off.
How long is she gonna be gone?

08:52.002 --> 08:54.140
I don't know.
She just went to show a house.

08:54.164 --> 08:55.782
Move.

08:55.806 --> 08:58.514
What's the problem?

08:58.538 --> 09:01.117
You mauled me
in Edie's bed last night.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.219
I think that deserves
a conversation.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.560
Well, what's there to talk
about? I'm just a fool in love.

09:06.584 --> 09:09.596
Oh, no! You don't mean that.

09:09.620 --> 09:12.929
Yes, I do. Look, I realize
my timing's a little off.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.300
A little?

09:14.324 --> 09:17.538
Ugh... the helium hasn't even
gone out of the balloons

09:17.562 --> 09:18.965
from your engagement party.

09:18.989 --> 09:23.610
Okay... When are you
gonna tell Edie? Tell her what?

09:23.634 --> 09:25.081
That the wedding's off. Is it?

09:25.105 --> 09:27.574
Well, isn't it? It's up to you.

09:27.598 --> 09:29.545
Are... are you saying...

09:29.569 --> 09:31.678
That you're gonna
go through with this wedding...

09:31.702 --> 09:33.680
Unless I tell you not to?

09:33.704 --> 09:35.687
Just give me a commitment,
susie q.,

09:35.711 --> 09:38.655
and I'll put a bullet in
Edie. This is insane!

09:38.679 --> 09:41.327
Come on.

09:41.351 --> 09:43.730
All this can be yours again.

09:43.754 --> 09:47.163
Just say the word...
And I let go.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.966
Oh, no! No, don't you dare!

09:49.990 --> 09:52.999
You know you want me to.
Just say it, susie q.

09:53.023 --> 09:55.642
You're...

09:55.666 --> 09:56.673
Sick!

09:59.369 --> 10:02.078
Zach,
I'm going to the drugstore.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.611
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

10:04.635 --> 10:06.913
Whoa!

10:06.937 --> 10:08.707
Oh!

10:21.792 --> 10:24.701
Paul?!

10:24.725 --> 10:28.675
I was making cookies, and I
heard the most sickening thud.

10:28.699 --> 10:30.306
Are you okay?

10:30.330 --> 10:31.778
There's...

10:31.802 --> 10:34.010
Shortening on my doorstep.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.642
Shortening?

10:35.666 --> 10:38.715
That's the last thing
you'd want on your front porch.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.009
It's meant for baking.

10:56.186 --> 11:00.206
She is so adorable,
and I just love the name Lily.

11:00.230 --> 11:01.708
It was my grandmother's name.

11:01.732 --> 11:03.810
So how you holding up?
You must be exhausted.

11:03.834 --> 11:06.821
You know, I'm a little tired, but it's
not too bad. Oh, wait a couple months.

11:06.845 --> 11:09.776
She'll start
sleeping through the night.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.778
Oh, honey, please.
Do I look like a masochist?

11:11.802 --> 11:13.780
Firs thing tomorrow, I'm hiring
a nanny and a night nurse.

11:13.804 --> 11:15.651
No, we're not.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.654
My husband, the comedian.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.057
I'm serious. I don't want
some stranger raising our baby.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.059
Well, you guys are busy.
We should go.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.861
Mm-hmm.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.433
No, it's okay.
I'll win this battle later.

11:27.457 --> 11:30.236
We are not gonna be
some yuppie couple

11:30.260 --> 11:33.700
pawning off our kid on other
people. End of discussion.

11:33.724 --> 11:35.011
Yeah, you should go.

11:35.035 --> 11:36.703
Yeah. Okay, bye.

11:36.727 --> 11:37.727
Good luck.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.151
Put down the burrito.

11:45.175 --> 11:48.154
What is all this crap
about me not getting help?

11:48.178 --> 11:51.157
Look, a brand-new baby
needs to bond with its mother.

11:51.181 --> 11:53.920
The church knows it, science
knows it, nature knows it.

11:53.944 --> 11:56.798
We have the money. What is wrong
with getting a little help?

11:56.822 --> 11:58.795
Then I'll be able
to relax once in a while,

11:58.819 --> 12:00.326
and I'll be able
tobea better mother.

12:00.350 --> 12:02.328
You wanna be a better mother?

12:02.352 --> 12:04.370
Do what mymamádid...
Make sacrifices.

12:04.394 --> 12:06.738
Mymamáworked her fingers
to the bone for me.

12:06.762 --> 12:09.257
And that's what put her
in an early grave!

12:11.261 --> 12:14.431
Well, that
and the hit-and-run thing.

12:22.342 --> 12:25.226
Look, I don't know why
you want to be emancipated,

12:25.250 --> 12:27.994
and I don't know what you've
been doing to drive him crazy.

12:28.018 --> 12:30.256
Bottom line... it's over.

12:30.280 --> 12:34.180
It's now time for you two
to kiss and make up.

12:35.786 --> 12:39.035
And just how
are we supposed to do that?

12:39.059 --> 12:41.107
Here's a thought...

12:41.131 --> 12:43.469
Just look each other
in the eye and say,

12:43.493 --> 12:45.003
"I forgive you."

12:47.767 --> 12:50.276
That'syour solution?

12:50.300 --> 12:51.778
It's actually
a technique invented

12:51.802 --> 12:53.749
by this Dutch therapist.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.251
I saw him on TV.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.523
He says,
if you verbalize forgiveness,

12:57.547 --> 13:01.387
the brain can trick the heart
into letting go of resentment.

13:01.411 --> 13:02.889
It really works.

13:02.913 --> 13:04.900
I did it with our cleaning lady.

13:04.924 --> 13:09.395
Um, I'm sorry, dad, but I think
my relationship with Andrew

13:09.419 --> 13:11.838
is just a bit more complicated
than...

13:11.862 --> 13:14.140
Would it kill you
to at least try?

13:14.164 --> 13:16.873
I'll do it... For you, grandpa.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.827
That's my boy. Bree?

13:22.402 --> 13:24.150
Fine!

13:24.174 --> 13:27.884
Yes, um...
So, um, who goes first?

13:27.908 --> 13:30.878
Either or. Doesn't matter.

13:32.512 --> 13:36.092
Mom, I forgive you.

13:36.116 --> 13:39.086
Andrew, I forgive you.

13:40.450 --> 13:42.899
That wasn't so hard, was it?

13:42.923 --> 13:46.107
Now don't expect
to feel differently right away.

13:46.131 --> 13:49.976
It takes a while. It took me
a week to forgive Esperanza.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.910
But now she's like family
again. Family who stole from us.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.321
So let's get back
to the way we were,

13:56.345 --> 14:00.917
and forget all this nonsense
about emancipation.

14:00.941 --> 14:01.941
Um...

14:04.244 --> 14:08.224
Well, grandpa, I'm... I'm still
gonna need my trust fund.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.326
You see,
I-I can't live in a place

14:10.350 --> 14:12.350
where I... I don't feel safe.

14:13.924 --> 14:15.537
What are you talking about?

14:15.561 --> 14:18.385
Well, could you live
with a woman who hits you?

14:20.390 --> 14:23.609
Bree! I slapped him once,
and he deserved it.

14:23.633 --> 14:26.017
Well, I just asked her
to stop drinking.

14:26.041 --> 14:27.073
You were drinking?

14:27.097 --> 14:30.076
She's in a.A.
Her sponsor has long hair.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.978
Andrew,
I find your concern ironic,

14:32.002 --> 14:33.980
given how tanked you were
when you ran over

14:34.004 --> 14:36.391
our neighbor's mother
with your car.

14:36.415 --> 14:39.555
Is she okay? She's dead!

14:39.579 --> 14:41.027
Well...

14:41.051 --> 14:43.990
Mom watched as her boyfriend
committed suicide.

14:44.014 --> 14:46.401
Andhe was the same guy
who killed dad!

14:46.425 --> 14:50.466
Andrew falsely accused me
of molestation...

14:50.490 --> 14:53.090
In a mall!

14:55.495 --> 14:58.074
You know,
the technique works best

14:58.098 --> 15:00.168
if you don't talk right away.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.560
Okay, let's go. I don't wanna
be late for the movie.

15:06.584 --> 15:09.376
Oh, those are pretty.
Who sent those?

15:11.011 --> 15:11.988
What?

15:12.012 --> 15:14.490
"Say the word and I'm yours.
Love, Karl."

15:14.514 --> 15:16.427
Mom, I knew this would happen

15:16.451 --> 15:18.224
when you started
hanging around together,

15:18.248 --> 15:20.226
all of your old feelings
resurfacing.

15:20.250 --> 15:21.928
No, hisfeelings.

15:21.952 --> 15:24.070
He'sthe one
with the feelings, not me.

15:24.094 --> 15:25.431
Uh-huh.

15:25.455 --> 15:28.104
Okay, don't "uh-huh" me. You're
not old enough to do that.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.106
Oh, no?
Well, how do you like this...

15:30.130 --> 15:33.379
I'm not gonna go to the movies with
you. You're gonna make me go by myself?

15:33.403 --> 15:35.386
Well, you could always
ask dad to go.

15:35.410 --> 15:37.383
In fact,
if you love him so much,

15:37.407 --> 15:39.085
why don't you marry him?

15:39.109 --> 15:41.117
Oh, wait, you already did.
Twice.

15:59.129 --> 16:02.059
Hey, Carol,
come on. Sit with us.

16:08.999 --> 16:10.476
Oh, you know what?

16:10.500 --> 16:12.979
I think we're gonna need
some napkins with this.

16:13.003 --> 16:15.221
Oh, okay, I'll go back. Thanks.

16:15.245 --> 16:17.683
My ex-boyfriend's here.
If he sees me alone, I'll die.

16:17.707 --> 16:19.685
I'm begging you, please,
act like you know me.

16:19.709 --> 16:22.188
Susan? Hey!

16:22.212 --> 16:24.660
Mike, hi!
What a surprise.

16:24.684 --> 16:28.964
How are ya? Good.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.567
Oh! God, I... I'm being so rude.

16:31.591 --> 16:35.201
Um, Mike,
I-I want you to meet...

16:35.225 --> 16:37.473
Orson hodge.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.376
Nice to meet you, Mike.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.078
Wow, I can't believe

16:42.102 --> 16:44.372
I'm finally seeing
the man himself in the flesh.

16:46.376 --> 16:49.655
So... how'd you two meet?

16:49.679 --> 16:52.418
Oh, god, I've been
her dentist for years.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.596
But last week,
I was looking in her mouth

16:55.620 --> 16:57.593
and decided
to stick my tongue in it.

17:01.591 --> 17:03.751
I'll see ya, Susan.

17:07.597 --> 17:09.575
Thank you so much
for helping me out.

17:09.598 --> 17:11.577
Hey, I'm great in a crisis.

17:13.103 --> 17:17.083
Well, I definitely picked
the right person to sit next to.

17:17.107 --> 17:19.785
Actually, is this seat taken?

17:19.809 --> 17:22.048
No.

17:22.071 --> 17:25.090
Okay, you can share my popcorn.

17:25.115 --> 17:27.423
Um, Susan...

17:27.446 --> 17:29.125
This is Becky.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.149
I'll probably be sharing
herpopcorn.

17:34.284 --> 17:36.211
I'll just wait
till the lights go out,

17:36.235 --> 17:37.726
and then I'll...

17:44.063 --> 17:47.050
While I get this going,
can you bring out the buns?

17:47.074 --> 17:48.114
Uh, yeah.

17:52.342 --> 17:55.072
What the hell? You all right?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.228
This isn't lighter fluid.
It's gasoline.

18:02.252 --> 18:03.489
What?

18:03.513 --> 18:06.092
How'd that get in there?

18:06.116 --> 18:07.786
How do you think?

18:12.292 --> 18:14.292
Something smells good
over there.

18:16.626 --> 18:20.176
Well, I don't understand.
Is she trying to kill you?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.848
No, she's trying to piss me off.

18:22.872 --> 18:24.480
Why?

18:24.504 --> 18:26.452
I'm not sure yet,

18:26.476 --> 18:29.084
but I do know
I'm not gonna play along.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.617
We got plenty of burgers
if you want to pop over.

18:31.641 --> 18:34.211
And bring your appetite.

18:47.497 --> 18:49.157
Gaby, the baby.

18:51.901 --> 18:54.380
No, I got up twice already.
It's your turn.

18:54.404 --> 18:56.221
Gaby, I have several
job interviews tomorrow.

18:56.245 --> 18:58.644
I need my sleep.

18:58.668 --> 19:01.238
What aboutmysleep?

19:04.714 --> 19:07.553
You sleep when the baby sleeps.

19:07.577 --> 19:09.255
Every 40 minutes?

19:09.279 --> 19:11.297
When am I supposed
to have a life?

19:11.321 --> 19:13.199
What are you whining about?

19:13.223 --> 19:15.706
You know, xiao-Mei does
all the housework around here.

19:15.730 --> 19:18.334
All you have to do
is take care of the baby.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.835
Fine, fine, fine!

19:23.893 --> 19:25.171
Psst!

19:25.195 --> 19:26.472
Xiao-Mei.

19:26.496 --> 19:28.143
Psst, wake up.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.576
Mrs. Solis?

19:30.600 --> 19:32.178
Something wrong?

19:32.202 --> 19:34.720
The baby won't stop crying,

19:34.744 --> 19:36.727
and I haven't slept
for two days.

19:36.751 --> 19:38.584
Will you please take
Lily for a while? Uh...

19:38.608 --> 19:42.188
Oh, come on. I won't make you
do windows tomorrow.

19:42.212 --> 19:45.160
Okay. What do I do?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.533
Well, she's a baby.
You hold her.

19:47.557 --> 19:49.235
You bounce her

19:49.259 --> 19:52.238
and, I don't know,
maybe sing a little something.

19:52.262 --> 19:54.500
Ahh.

19:54.524 --> 19:56.242
Oh, and xiao-Mei,

19:56.266 --> 19:59.305
Mr. Solis does not need to know about this,
okay? Okay.

19:59.329 --> 20:01.207
Okay.

20:06.336 --> 20:08.784
Yeah, honey, can you
take that downstairs?

20:08.808 --> 20:10.378
Thank you.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.195
Eleanor,
I thought you'd gone to bed.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.698
Oh, no, not yet.
I had to do my hair now.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.309
There's never enough time
in the morning.

20:25.333 --> 20:26.772
Uh, sit.

20:26.796 --> 20:30.276
There's something
I have to discuss with you.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.778
Your father and I
have decided to take Andrew

20:32.802 --> 20:34.310
back to Rhode Island with us.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.211
Really?

20:36.235 --> 20:38.314
And whose idea was that?

20:38.338 --> 20:40.246
Andrew's.

20:40.270 --> 20:44.290
But Henry and I feel
it's the right thing to do.

20:44.314 --> 20:46.924
Absolutely not.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.927
If we leave him here,

20:51.951 --> 20:54.430
the two of you
will wind up in court,

20:54.454 --> 20:56.441
and I'm not going to allow that.

20:56.465 --> 20:57.933
Do you really think

20:57.957 --> 21:01.407
that I am enjoying airing
my dirty laundry in public?

21:01.431 --> 21:04.740
This whole situation
is mortifying.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.418
But I can't back down
because he is my son,

21:07.442 --> 21:09.715
and I need more time
to get through to him.

21:09.739 --> 21:13.248
You never give up.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.452
I've always admired that
about you.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.953
When you were a kid,

21:17.977 --> 21:20.286
you used to make
these peanut butter cookies

21:20.310 --> 21:22.388
that were god-awful.

21:22.412 --> 21:23.859
But you kept baking them,

21:23.883 --> 21:27.363
and you kept forcing everyone
to eat them.

21:28.458 --> 21:31.697
You were so determined
to get them right.

21:31.721 --> 21:34.740
My mother didn't think
they were awful.

21:34.764 --> 21:38.281
When I made those same cookies
for her, she loved them.

21:38.305 --> 21:41.006
Well, some people
praise children

21:41.030 --> 21:43.309
even when they don't deserve it.

21:43.333 --> 21:44.680
Oh, but not you.

21:44.704 --> 21:48.388
With you, I had to work for
every kind word I ever got.

21:48.412 --> 21:51.457
Well, you always resented me
because of my high standards.

21:51.481 --> 21:53.018
No.

21:53.042 --> 21:54.520
I resented you

21:54.544 --> 21:57.024
because those were kick-ass
peanut butter cookies.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.697
We're taking Andrew.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.400
Eleanor, please...

22:04.424 --> 22:06.532
He hates you, Bree.

22:06.556 --> 22:09.635
Your own son.

22:09.659 --> 22:11.937
You know, part of being an adult

22:11.961 --> 22:14.580
is admitting that you've failed,

22:14.604 --> 22:16.882
and then moving on...

22:16.906 --> 22:18.406
With grace.

22:20.109 --> 22:25.320
Do you really think that I am
a failure as a parent?

22:25.344 --> 22:29.031
Well, I'd love to lie
and say something supportive,

22:29.055 --> 22:31.026
but as you pointed out,

22:31.050 --> 22:34.550
that was more
your mother's thing.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.341
Xiao-Mei?

22:46.365 --> 22:48.343
So sorry. I just take break.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.345
Oh, no, xiao-Mei,
that's okay. That's okay.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.848
I know you were up all night
with the baby,

22:52.872 --> 22:54.920
and I really appreciate it.

22:54.944 --> 22:57.453
You know, I'm very grateful

22:57.477 --> 22:59.455
for everything
you've been doing for Lily.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.027
So to thank you, I bought you
a gift certificate to my spa.

23:02.051 --> 23:05.398
And you can take a whole day off
and just really pamper yourself.

23:05.422 --> 23:06.692
Really? Mm-hmm.

23:06.716 --> 23:08.464
Thank you!

23:08.488 --> 23:09.665
Oh, thank you!

23:09.689 --> 23:11.366
Oh, you're welcome.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.669
All right, Lily needs
to be bathed and put to bed.

23:13.693 --> 23:16.642
I don't wanna miss
my yoga class. Hi.

23:16.666 --> 23:20.676
Hi, pretty girl.
Oh, yes, mommy has to go.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.377
Mommy has to go,

23:22.401 --> 23:25.458
so she can stay pretty and thin
and you can be proud of her.

23:27.737 --> 23:29.915
Motherhood is such a blessing.

23:29.939 --> 23:32.409
I hope you get
to experience it one day.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.394
Because
it'snota big deal!

23:39.418 --> 23:40.696
"It's not a big deal"? Okay!

23:40.720 --> 23:43.699
It's not that far away. Right. Oh,
it's not that far away?

23:43.723 --> 23:45.476
Dude, it... whatever, okay?

23:45.500 --> 23:48.133
You didn't even care
to tell me before? Bye.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.480
Justin, what happened?

23:54.504 --> 23:57.491
Andrew just told me he's
moving in with his grandparents.

23:57.515 --> 23:59.485
They live so far away,

23:59.509 --> 24:01.146
I'm never gonna see him anymore.

24:01.170 --> 24:03.670
I'msosorry. I know
that you're good friends.

24:05.975 --> 24:10.095
We're more than friends,
Mrs. Van De Kamp.

24:10.119 --> 24:11.597
I love him.

24:11.621 --> 24:14.121
Oh.

24:16.025 --> 24:17.162
Why?

24:17.186 --> 24:18.904
Why?

24:18.928 --> 24:20.906
Yes. I'd be curious to know

24:20.930 --> 24:24.009
just what it is you see in him.

24:24.033 --> 24:26.950
Well, when my parents
first heard I was gay,

24:26.974 --> 24:28.874
they kicked me out.

24:28.898 --> 24:31.847
They said I had debased
the entire family

24:31.871 --> 24:34.550
and that they couldn't
love me anymore

24:34.574 --> 24:36.181
until I changed.

24:36.205 --> 24:39.825
But Andrew... he said that
ishould be ashamed of them,

24:39.849 --> 24:43.889
'cause they were too stupid
to know how great I was.

24:43.913 --> 24:46.592
That's the thing about Andrew.

24:46.616 --> 24:48.494
He doesn't take crap
from anyone.

24:48.518 --> 24:51.597
How can you not
love someone like that?

24:51.621 --> 24:53.899
You know,
it never ceases to amaze me

24:53.923 --> 24:56.907
how people can turn their backs
on their own family.

24:56.931 --> 24:59.545
I mean... but it happens
every day, doesn't it?

24:59.569 --> 25:00.946
I guess.

25:00.970 --> 25:04.550
You know, Justin, if you
would be willing to help,

25:04.574 --> 25:06.051
I'm pretty sure

25:06.075 --> 25:09.054
that I could find a way
to keep Andrew from moving.

25:09.078 --> 25:11.708
What do you say?

25:16.285 --> 25:17.262
I'm home.

25:17.286 --> 25:18.263
Oh, hi.

25:18.287 --> 25:19.765
Hey, Mrs. McCluskey.

25:19.789 --> 25:22.668
So how did everything go?

25:22.692 --> 25:26.131
Fine. Penny fussed a bit.

25:26.155 --> 25:28.634
I think her molars
are coming in. Oh.

25:28.658 --> 25:30.636
And the twins
fought over the remote.

25:30.660 --> 25:33.138
There's nothing new there.
No.

25:33.162 --> 25:34.640
Here's the big news...

25:34.664 --> 25:38.774
Parker offered me a fudgsicle
if I would show him my vagina.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.719
Oh, good god, Lynette, relax.
I didn't do it.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.697
I just got this
out of the freezer a second ago.

25:46.721 --> 25:48.694
Uh, yeah. Of course. No, sorry.

25:48.718 --> 25:50.996
Apparently, Parker wanted to put
a sunflower seed inside me

25:51.020 --> 25:54.700
and see if a baby would grow.
Where do kids get this stuff?

25:54.724 --> 25:56.531
Oh... that was me.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.834
He was asking about
the birds and the bees,

25:58.858 --> 26:01.558
and I fudged
a few of the details.

26:02.932 --> 26:05.540
Well, he's only 7 years old.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.148
I don't think he needs
to know everything yet.

26:08.172 --> 26:10.816
I don't wanna Rob him
of his innocence.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.818
Well, now,
that's where you're wrong.

26:12.842 --> 26:15.550
You get 'em when they're young.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.557
Give them all the gory details.

26:17.581 --> 26:20.185
And then when they're good
and disgusted, you shame 'em.

26:20.209 --> 26:22.728
Excuse me?

26:22.752 --> 26:24.890
You tell them
sex is dirty and wrong

26:24.914 --> 26:26.837
and he shouldn't talk about it,

26:26.861 --> 26:28.834
and if he does,
he's going straight to hell.

26:28.858 --> 26:31.837
That is ridiculous.

26:31.861 --> 26:34.039
Spoken like
a true liberal idiot.

26:34.063 --> 26:35.780
No, I'm not gonna shame my son.

26:35.804 --> 26:38.103
Mm, I'm telling ya, it works.

26:38.127 --> 26:40.676
It keeps people in their place,

26:40.700 --> 26:42.948
it keeps parents
from being humiliated,

26:42.972 --> 26:45.180
and it keeps me from
having to spend the afternoon

26:45.204 --> 26:46.944
talking about my woo-woo.

26:58.918 --> 27:02.798
In your haste to duck out before
the credits rolled, you...

27:02.822 --> 27:06.632
Oh, my god!
Oh, thank you so much.

27:06.656 --> 27:09.635
I stuck a card in there,
just in case you ever wanted

27:09.659 --> 27:11.637
to purposely sit next to me
at a movie, so...

27:11.661 --> 27:15.711
Orson, I'm flattered.
Uh, really.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.043
You...
You don't wanna date me.

27:18.067 --> 27:21.246
I-I mean, my love life is just
so complicated right now.

27:21.270 --> 27:25.320
Well... no, I won't bore you
with the details.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.198
So the ex-boyfriend has no idea
you're secretly married

27:28.222 --> 27:30.195
to the ex-husband,
who still loves you,

27:30.219 --> 27:32.728
but unless you give him
a reason not to,

27:32.752 --> 27:34.660
is gonna marry
the neighborhood slut?

27:34.684 --> 27:36.707
Did I call Edie a slut? Mm-hmm.

27:36.731 --> 27:38.704
Well, that's overstating it.
Edie's not a slut.

27:38.728 --> 27:41.807
She's just... popular
with indiscriminate men.

27:41.831 --> 27:44.710
Anyway... yes, those are
the relevant players.

27:44.734 --> 27:46.647
Okay. Now I'm
absolutely horrified

27:46.671 --> 27:48.944
that I'm about to say
what I'm about to say,

27:48.968 --> 27:51.646
but there's nobody else I can
talk to who won't judge me.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.648
And since
you're a complete stranger,

27:53.672 --> 27:55.756
I'll probably
never see you again

27:55.780 --> 27:57.753
unless I randomly
run into you on the street,

27:57.777 --> 28:01.787
in which case, you'll ignore me
'cause you know how crazy I am.

28:01.811 --> 28:03.088
So here goes...

28:03.112 --> 28:06.692
I'm having feelings
for Karl again.

28:06.716 --> 28:09.765
Does that make me
a terrible person?

28:09.789 --> 28:12.738
You want my unvarnished opinion?

28:12.762 --> 28:14.840
Lay it on me.

28:14.864 --> 28:16.851
It doesn't make you
a terrible person,

28:16.875 --> 28:18.704
but it does make you a...

28:18.728 --> 28:21.106
Well... a sucker.

28:21.130 --> 28:22.948
This Karl's a coward.

28:22.972 --> 28:26.311
He wants you to be the heavy
and take all the responsibility.

28:26.335 --> 28:27.753
If you're having feelings
for a guy like that,

28:27.777 --> 28:29.985
I say run... Far, far away.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.987
He lives three houses down.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.289
Hmm.
Well, good luck to you, then.

28:38.147 --> 28:41.396
But like I said, if you're
interested in a tooth whitening,

28:41.420 --> 28:43.420
my card's still in your wallet.

28:48.958 --> 28:51.228
Xiao-Mei?

28:53.432 --> 28:54.840
Xiao-Mei?

28:54.864 --> 28:57.312
I'm late to meet
Mrs. Van De Kamp.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.336
I'll be back in a little while.

29:06.816 --> 29:08.854
Bree... I'm so sorry I'm late.

29:08.878 --> 29:10.355
Oh, honey, it's all right.

29:10.379 --> 29:12.357
I mean,
with the new baby at home,

29:12.381 --> 29:14.860
I'm surprised
you made it at all.

29:14.884 --> 29:16.844
Ooh, I'll have a drink.
Anything with an umbrella.

29:18.888 --> 29:22.337
So tell me, how are you doing?

29:22.361 --> 29:24.840
I mean, your entire world
must be turned upside down.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.172
You must be exhausted.

29:27.196 --> 29:30.415
You know, it's been challenging,
but I-I soldier on.

29:30.439 --> 29:32.848
So what about you?
You look so rested.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.880
I just got a massage
at misty spring.

29:34.904 --> 29:36.887
Things have been
a little tense at home,

29:36.911 --> 29:38.884
and I needed an hour to relax.

29:38.908 --> 29:40.886
Good for you. I love that spa.

29:40.910 --> 29:43.358
Mm. Um, oh, by the way,
while I was there,

29:43.382 --> 29:45.390
I saw your, uh,
your housekeeper.

29:45.414 --> 29:47.232
Xiao-Mei?

29:47.256 --> 29:49.234
Oh, no, you must be mistaken.

29:49.258 --> 29:51.797
I just left her.
She's at home working.

29:51.821 --> 29:54.800
Are you sure? I was talking
to her in the steam room

29:54.824 --> 29:57.372
for about 20 minutes. What?

29:57.396 --> 29:59.996
Yeah, apparently you gave her
a gift certificate.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.384
Lily?

30:09.408 --> 30:12.108
Lily, mommy's coming!

30:13.883 --> 30:18.123
Oh, thank god!
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

30:18.147 --> 30:20.487
I'm never gonna
leave you again. Oh!

30:22.521 --> 30:24.569
Yes. Yes.

30:24.593 --> 30:27.873
I'm home!

30:27.897 --> 30:29.935
My interview got canceled.

30:29.959 --> 30:32.978
Oh, that's my little girl.

30:33.002 --> 30:35.562
Your chakra lining up nice
for mommy?

30:38.007 --> 30:39.444
That's my girl.

30:39.468 --> 30:42.988
Hey,
let me take her off your chest

30:43.012 --> 30:44.289
so you can do your yoga.

30:44.313 --> 30:46.992
No! No, no, no.
We're doing just fine.

30:47.016 --> 30:48.476
Aren't we, Lily?

31:01.961 --> 31:04.369
Bridezilla's got me
auditioning wedding bands,

31:04.393 --> 31:06.376
and I'm clueless about
Edie's taste in music.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.373
What do you think of these guys?

31:08.397 --> 31:10.375
That's why you brought
me down here? Mm-hmm.

31:10.399 --> 31:12.517
Karl, you made it sound like
it was an emergency.

31:12.541 --> 31:15.220
It is! I need to have somebody
to dance with so I can see

31:15.244 --> 31:18.961
if these guys have the power
to help me get my groove on.

31:18.985 --> 31:20.278
Karl... Uh-oh!

31:22.081 --> 31:23.558
Oh, that's right.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.560
You like it laid-back
and romantic, don't you?

31:25.584 --> 31:27.567
Guys, can we play
something mellow?

31:27.591 --> 31:29.564
No, don't bother,
'cause I'm going.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.066
Two...

31:32.121 --> 31:34.639
♪ You are so beautiful... ♪

31:34.663 --> 31:37.933
That was not a coincidence.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.978
This was playing
the night we first kissed.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.911
♪ To me... ♪
it's our song. Remember?

31:45.935 --> 31:48.083
I remember. I also remember that

31:48.107 --> 31:50.155
you are planning
on marrying someone else.

31:50.179 --> 31:52.057
Not if you don't want me to.

31:52.081 --> 31:54.659
Come on, susie q.

31:54.683 --> 31:57.170
I can see you still
have feelings for me,

31:57.194 --> 32:00.495
and I know I have
never stopped loving you.

32:00.519 --> 32:01.997
Okay, you want the truth?

32:02.021 --> 32:03.999
I don't know
how I feel about you,

32:04.023 --> 32:06.001
but I keep looking at you,

32:06.025 --> 32:09.004
trying to see if you've changed,
if you've grown up.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.305
You know what I see?

32:10.329 --> 32:12.307
I see the same weak coward

32:12.331 --> 32:15.040
that walked out on me
three years ago.

32:15.064 --> 32:17.012
Of course I've changed.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.413
I don't think so.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.245
♪ Everything I need... ♪

32:20.269 --> 32:23.918
So I think you should
probably stay with Edie.

32:23.942 --> 32:27.522
♪ You are so beautiful... ♪

32:27.546 --> 32:31.556
And the band is good.
You should hire 'em.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.328
♪ To me ♪

32:33.352 --> 32:37.992
♪ Can't you see? ♪

33:07.616 --> 33:09.616
What the hell?

33:12.221 --> 33:13.698
For god's sakes...

33:13.722 --> 33:16.006
What the hell
are you doing in there?!

33:16.030 --> 33:17.542
This is my house.
What are you doing?

33:17.566 --> 33:19.544
We're tenting for termites.
We got a work order.

33:19.568 --> 33:21.046
Signed by who?

33:21.070 --> 33:22.477
Paul...

33:22.501 --> 33:26.011
I've never been so embarrassed
in my whole life.

33:26.035 --> 33:28.053
They're supposed
to be tenting my house.

33:28.077 --> 33:30.985
I must've written
the address down wrong.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.689
muchachos,
mi casa está aquí.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.526
You've taken it too far
this time.

33:36.550 --> 33:39.145
These little mind games
are gonna stop right now!

33:41.150 --> 33:43.768
And if
they don't, whatcha gonna do?

33:43.792 --> 33:46.079
Blow out your brains
like your wife did?

33:46.103 --> 33:47.602
Ahh!

33:47.626 --> 33:49.704
Hey, hey!

33:49.728 --> 33:53.038
Hey, you okay?
Did you hear that?

33:53.062 --> 33:55.110
He assaulted me
for an honest mistake.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.591
God knows what would've happened
if you hadn't been here.

33:57.615 --> 33:58.643
Let go!

33:58.667 --> 34:00.107
Dad, dad, dad. Come on.

34:01.110 --> 34:03.610
Come on. Come on, okay?

34:09.717 --> 34:13.098
I talked to Mrs. McCluskey,
and for god's sakes, Parker,

34:13.121 --> 34:15.500
youcan'task people
things like that.

34:15.524 --> 34:16.601
Why?

34:16.625 --> 34:18.803
Because...

34:18.827 --> 34:20.205
It's rude.

34:20.228 --> 34:21.306
I said "please."

34:21.330 --> 34:23.467
Well, that doesn't matter!

34:23.492 --> 34:27.512
You gotta quit talking
to people about their bodies,

34:27.536 --> 34:30.145
and about where, you know,
babies come from.

34:30.168 --> 34:31.716
Why?

34:31.739 --> 34:34.549
Because it's not
an appropriate subject.

34:34.572 --> 34:35.650
Why?

34:35.674 --> 34:37.452
Because it's not.

34:37.476 --> 34:38.683
Why?

34:38.706 --> 34:40.685
Ugh!
Because it's dirty and wrong,

34:40.708 --> 34:44.188
and I'll wash your mouth out
with soap! That's why.

34:44.213 --> 34:46.060
In that moment,

34:46.083 --> 34:48.101
Lynette saw a look
on her son's face

34:48.125 --> 34:51.166
she had never seen before...

34:51.190 --> 34:53.467
And she thought of the look
he had on his face

34:53.492 --> 34:56.449
when he had become obsessed
with dinosaurs...

34:56.473 --> 34:58.573
Obsessed with baseball

34:58.597 --> 35:01.176
and obsessed with trains.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.148
And it occurred to Lynette

35:03.172 --> 35:05.810
she didn't need
to shame her son.

35:05.834 --> 35:10.755
All he needed was
a brand-new obsession.

35:10.779 --> 35:13.258
But I thought you said
we couldn't have a puppy.

35:13.282 --> 35:16.491
Well... it turns out
we really needed one.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.823
You can go and play.

35:18.847 --> 35:21.826
And though she didn't know it
at the time,

35:21.850 --> 35:23.828
it would be another three years

35:23.852 --> 35:29.302
before Parker Scavo would
ever ask about sex again.

35:31.500 --> 35:34.179
Karl. What's going on?

35:34.203 --> 35:36.181
Uh, I'm on my way to a motel.

35:36.205 --> 35:38.683
I-I just wanted to let you know
that the wedding is off.

35:38.707 --> 35:40.415
It is?

35:40.439 --> 35:43.117
I told Edie
I wasn't in love with her...

35:43.141 --> 35:45.320
At least, not in the way
that she deserves.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.484
Wow.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.125
Why did you change your mind?

35:51.149 --> 35:54.429
I mean, I hope it wasn't because of me,
because I told you... it wasn't for you.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.201
No?

35:56.225 --> 35:59.534
You were right.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.236
I have been a coward.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.538
I was a coward three years ago
when I walked out

36:03.562 --> 36:05.540
on the two most important people
in my life.

36:05.564 --> 36:08.413
And I was being a coward
with Edie.

36:08.437 --> 36:12.146
I mean,
to even consider marrying her

36:12.170 --> 36:17.850
when I know what real passion
and real love feels like.

36:19.378 --> 36:23.728
Anyway, I-I-I just thought
I'd let you know.

36:23.752 --> 36:25.882
Karl...

36:29.258 --> 36:31.236
You look pretty beat up.

36:32.921 --> 36:35.840
Why... why don't you...
Why don't you come in and...

36:35.864 --> 36:37.851
We'll crack open
a bottle of wine.

36:37.875 --> 36:39.226
Come on.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.480
All right, here we go.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.487
This is the last
of Andrew's things.

36:47.511 --> 36:50.485
Once we tape up these boxes,
we can start loading the car.

36:50.509 --> 36:52.186
I'm proud of you, Bree.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.319
You're being awfully big
about this.

36:54.343 --> 36:57.667
Well, I have to admit,
I was a bit upset at first.

36:57.691 --> 37:00.525
But then it hit me.
You're his grandparents.

37:00.549 --> 37:03.698
You should bond,
get to know the real Andrew.

37:05.254 --> 37:07.237
Oh, dad, I-I forgot to warn you.

37:07.261 --> 37:09.234
These are some
of Andrew's adult videos.

37:09.258 --> 37:11.558
I don't approve,
but boys will be boys.

37:13.402 --> 37:17.211
Oh, Henry,
stop looking at that filth.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.514
I don't get it.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.215
Where are the women?

37:21.239 --> 37:23.348
What are you talking about?

37:23.372 --> 37:26.651
This is all just a bunch of...
Naked men.

37:26.675 --> 37:30.425
Sweet mother of god.
What the hell are they doing?

37:30.449 --> 37:34.259
I don't know, and I don't
even know what I'm looking at.

37:34.283 --> 37:36.766
Henry, this is pornography
for ho-homosexuals.

37:36.790 --> 37:39.564
Oh, shoot! I wish you
hadn't gone through that.

37:39.588 --> 37:42.236
Now we have to have
an unpleasant conversation,

37:42.260 --> 37:44.238
and we were having
such a nice time.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.271
Bree, is...

37:46.295 --> 37:48.713
Is Andrew... gay?

37:48.737 --> 37:51.916
Oh, dad, andrewhateslabels.
I'm sure it's just a phase.

37:51.940 --> 37:53.278
Excuse me,

37:53.302 --> 37:56.386
but he has a magazine titled
"leather daddies in love."

37:56.410 --> 37:58.853
That does not sound like
a phase to me.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.356
Maybe not, but it's no longer
myconcern

38:01.380 --> 38:03.710
now that he'll be living
withyou.

38:05.384 --> 38:08.693
We have to have a serious talk.

38:08.717 --> 38:11.636
Let's don't freak out
about this.

38:11.660 --> 38:13.368
The Dutch therapist says...

38:13.392 --> 38:16.871
Forget the Dutch therapist!
In the kitchen!

38:16.895 --> 38:18.565
Now!

38:30.639 --> 38:32.317
Hey,
where's grandma and grandpa?

38:32.341 --> 38:34.288
I need to start
loading up my stuff.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.329
Oh, they, uh, they already left.

38:36.353 --> 38:38.793
Wait... they left?

38:38.817 --> 38:39.794
Without me?

38:39.818 --> 38:42.648
Uh, yeah,
they wrote you a letter.

38:46.725 --> 38:50.375
It seems they came across
some personal items of yours

38:50.399 --> 38:52.036
that, um, upset them.

38:52.060 --> 38:54.479
They're taking away
my trust fund?

38:54.503 --> 38:56.411
They can't do that!

38:56.435 --> 38:57.912
Well, actually they can.

38:57.936 --> 39:02.347
I mean, it's their money to
dispense with as they see fit.

39:02.371 --> 39:04.749
I know
it doesn't seem fair, but...

39:04.773 --> 39:07.792
No, it'sreallyunfair.
In fact, it sucks.

39:07.816 --> 39:10.455
What... what am I supposed
to do now?

39:10.479 --> 39:12.757
Well, now that you can't afford
to become emancipated,

39:12.781 --> 39:15.660
I guess you're gonna
have to stay here with me.

39:15.684 --> 39:19.103
Andrew, we can make this work.

39:19.127 --> 39:21.636
We just have
to let go of our anger.

39:21.660 --> 39:24.590
No.

39:26.935 --> 39:28.913
Oh, I, um, had a chance

39:28.937 --> 39:32.046
to have a nice chat
with Justin the other day.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.948
He really seems very sweet.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.850
I've invited him over
for dinner tonight.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.884
I hope you don't mind.

39:46.615 --> 39:49.093
Now I wish I hadn't
torched our wedding photos.

39:51.159 --> 39:52.797
Who would've thought,

39:52.821 --> 39:54.499
after everything
that's happened,

39:54.523 --> 39:56.810
that we would've
ended up back here again?

39:56.834 --> 39:59.373
It's been
one hell of a ride, huh?

39:59.397 --> 40:00.897
Yeah.

40:02.671 --> 40:04.979
So how do you feel now?

40:05.003 --> 40:05.980
About us?

40:06.004 --> 40:07.712
Mm.

40:07.736 --> 40:10.555
I feel good.

40:10.579 --> 40:12.487
I feel happy.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.859
You're not having
second thoughts?

40:14.883 --> 40:17.870
I can't believe you actually
want to talk about feelings.

40:17.894 --> 40:19.564
You reallyhavechanged.

40:19.588 --> 40:21.566
Hey, this is the new Karl, baby.

40:21.590 --> 40:23.568
He's not afraid to cry.

40:28.126 --> 40:29.103
Hello?

40:30.128 --> 40:32.477
Oh, hi, Edie.

40:32.501 --> 40:35.540
Uh... yeah, he's here.

40:35.564 --> 40:36.521
Hold on.

40:36.545 --> 40:38.943
How does
she know you're here?

40:38.967 --> 40:41.486
I don't know.

40:41.510 --> 40:44.018
Hi. Ahem.

40:44.042 --> 40:47.029
Yeah, I just came by to help
Julie with her civics homework.

40:47.053 --> 40:49.494
Uh-huh.

40:49.518 --> 40:53.528
Okay, I'll take care of it.
What kind of juice do you want?

40:53.552 --> 40:55.600
Right. Bye, bye.

40:55.624 --> 40:57.611
Are you getting juice for her?

40:57.635 --> 41:00.004
Yeah, just one carton.

41:00.028 --> 41:02.066
You ripped
the woman's heart out.

41:02.090 --> 41:04.769
Why would she want juice
fromyou?

41:04.793 --> 41:06.776
Okay.
Now don't freak out,

41:06.800 --> 41:09.614
but this breakup is
sort of a work in progress.

41:09.638 --> 41:11.976
She doesn't know? Will
you calm down? I can explain.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.849
So if Edie doesn't know,
then that means

41:14.873 --> 41:17.652
that you just cheated
on her... with me!

41:17.676 --> 41:21.786
You mademethe other woman! Please don't
be angry. I tried to break up with her,

41:21.810 --> 41:23.788
but because I wasn't sure
you wanted me back,

41:23.812 --> 41:25.530
the words just wouldn't
come out of my mouth.

41:25.554 --> 41:28.041
Now that I know that
you want me and love me again,

41:28.065 --> 41:29.534
it's a done deal.

41:29.558 --> 41:32.997
Get out of my house,
you miserable son of a bitch!

41:33.021 --> 41:34.939
Can't we talk about this?

41:34.963 --> 41:36.941
No, just get out! Get out!

41:36.965 --> 41:39.504
Susie, susie!
Our marriage was garbage!

41:39.528 --> 41:42.507
Stupid, disgusting pile of garbage! No,
no, don't say that.

41:42.531 --> 41:45.510
And I regret everything that
came of it! Don't do this right now.

41:45.534 --> 41:47.691
Ugh! Except you, honey.
You're my rock.

41:47.715 --> 41:49.584
Ooh, out! Get out!

41:49.608 --> 41:50.815
I... Ugh!

41:50.839 --> 41:53.988
I promise you I'm gonna break up
with Edie and make this right.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.729
I'll call you when it's done.
Don't bother! I won't pick up.

42:05.654 --> 42:10.074
We've all done something
in our lives we're ashamed of.

42:10.098 --> 42:14.238
Some of us have fallen
for the wrong man.

42:14.262 --> 42:18.913
Some have let go
of the right woman.

42:18.937 --> 42:23.667
There are those who have
humiliated their parents...

42:25.844 --> 42:30.695
And those who have failed
their children.

42:30.719 --> 42:32.557
Yes,

42:32.581 --> 42:37.261
we've all made mistakes that
diminish us and those we love.

42:37.285 --> 42:40.064
But there is redemption

42:40.088 --> 42:43.088
if we try to learn from
those mistakes... and grow.
