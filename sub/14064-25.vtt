WEBVTT

00:01.628 --> 00:03.186
You gave me the Crane legacy.

00:03.186 --> 00:05.624
And I fully plan on living up to it.

00:05.659 --> 00:06.698
He's not my son.

00:06.733 --> 00:08.141
Obviously he doesn't know.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.476
You're not my father?

00:09.511 --> 00:12.212
I'm not terribly comfortable with you
working closely with this woman.

00:12.212 --> 00:13.712
You and I are in a relationship, Alan.

00:13.712 --> 00:16.702
The fact that you don't realize it
doesn't give you license to be unfaithful.

00:16.702 --> 00:17.859
You're mad as a hatter.

00:17.859 --> 00:19.644
Donny Crane. You remember me.

00:19.679 --> 00:21.395
We used to be father and son.

00:21.395 --> 00:23.041
I may not have been around much,

00:23.041 --> 00:25.604
but I was always there
when you needed me.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.292
Still am.

00:34.664 --> 00:40.957
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America

00:40.992 --> 00:44.632
and to the Republic for which it stands,

00:44.667 --> 00:52.881
one nation, under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

00:54.161 --> 00:58.347
Well, Denny, that was refreshing
and patriotic. What gives?

00:58.382 --> 01:00.244
I, Denny Crane,

01:00.279 --> 01:03.973
am going to court to represent
the United States of America.

01:04.007 --> 01:06.833
And what has our country done
to deserve you?

01:06.868 --> 01:09.659
US attorney and the DOJ
had to recuse themselves,

01:09.659 --> 01:13.308
so Alberto appointed me
to carry the ball for team USA.

01:13.343 --> 01:16.183
The greatest lawyer in the world representing
the greatest country in the world,

01:16.183 --> 01:18.492
a match made in heaven.

01:18.527 --> 01:19.652
Did you know about this?

01:19.652 --> 01:20.693
I did not.

01:20.811 --> 01:23.431
Where's a sitter when you need one?

01:25.958 --> 01:28.720
And we're back in court
on the Arrow lake water case.

01:28.720 --> 01:32.626
Opposing counsel is relentless.
Yet another evidentiary hearing.

01:32.661 --> 01:34.841
Denise, per your status report,

01:34.876 --> 01:39.655
you had your mandatory settlement
conference with <i>datemistake.com</i> last week.

01:39.655 --> 01:41.226
<i>datemistake.com</i> ?

01:41.261 --> 01:44.340
It's an internet site where women
can vent their ill feelings about

01:44.340 --> 01:47.129
the men they've dated
as a warning to other women.

01:47.129 --> 01:49.884
Our client Derek Roth
has been defamed by them.

01:49.884 --> 01:51.263
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:51.298 --> 01:54.433
I, um, you were just a little
in my space.

01:54.468 --> 01:56.621
Yes, Shirley, we did reach a settlement.

01:56.621 --> 02:00.969
As for Denny, the judge denied
the government's motion to dismiss.

02:01.004 --> 02:03.394
So the spectacle of Denny Crane

02:03.429 --> 02:07.725
representing the United States
will continue to play out in federal court,

02:07.725 --> 02:09.086
God save us all.

02:09.122 --> 02:10.519
What judge did Denny get?

02:10.519 --> 02:12.451
Judge Kimberly Ohlund.

02:12.486 --> 02:14.472
I used to clerk for her.

02:14.507 --> 02:16.933
Her current clerk Dan Jinks
and I play squash.

02:16.933 --> 02:18.552
I'm e-mailing Dan now.

02:18.587 --> 02:22.867
He'll give me everything from the judge's
political leanings to her basal temperature
after breakfast.

02:22.867 --> 02:24.635
Thank you, Marlene.

02:24.828 --> 02:30.044
Sorry I'm late, but as usual,
I'm really only here for the fruit.

02:32.826 --> 02:34.598
Something new.

02:34.633 --> 02:37.256
Alan, Marlene Stanger.
Marlene, Alan Shore.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.803
A pleasure, Ms Stanger.

02:38.838 --> 02:40.214
Mr Shore.

02:44.149 --> 02:46.669
Marlene comes to us
from Howard and Brock.

02:46.702 --> 02:49.220
Your name came up frequently
at my old firm.

02:49.220 --> 02:51.755
I hope amid a torrent of obscenities.

02:51.790 --> 02:52.881
Always.

02:52.916 --> 02:53.972
Good.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:02.157 --> 03:04.356
I look forward to working
with you, Ms Stanger.

03:04.356 --> 03:09.980
It's not often you meet someone
with such ocular precision.

03:52.516 --> 03:54.364
Why won't you try this case with me?

03:54.364 --> 03:55.821
Personal reasons.

03:55.856 --> 03:57.296
It's because you're red.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.640
That's the old red, not the new red,
which is the opposite of blue. That's good.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.704
It's the old red. That's bad and pink.

04:02.704 --> 04:05.781
Regardless of my pigmentation,
I promised I'd sit with you.

04:05.781 --> 04:06.872
That's the best I can do.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.513
Denny Crane doesn't need any sitters.

04:08.513 --> 04:10.596
What are these “personal reasons” anyway?

04:10.596 --> 04:11.637
It's the global gag rule.

04:11.637 --> 04:13.103
Nonsense.

04:13.104 --> 04:15.508
Gags are dangerous, locally or globally.

04:15.543 --> 04:18.903
You don't even know what
the global gag rule is, do you?

04:18.925 --> 04:20.574
I can tell you.

04:21.041 --> 04:25.539
The global gag rule forces other countries
where abortion is perfectly legal

04:25.539 --> 04:28.708
to stop performing them or even
uttering the word “abortion,”

04:28.708 --> 04:32.041
otherwise, the United States
cuts off their funding.

04:32.076 --> 04:32.984
Donny.

04:33.019 --> 04:33.893
Denny.

04:33.894 --> 04:35.407
Alan.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.920
Donny.

04:39.278 --> 04:40.413
What are you doing here?

04:40.413 --> 04:42.071
I'm with Lawyers Without Borders.

04:42.071 --> 04:45.769
They heard you were brought in after the judge
denied the government's motion to dismiss.

04:45.769 --> 04:46.756
Liberal pinko.

04:46.791 --> 04:47.744
Please rise.

04:47.745 --> 04:50.223
The honorable Kimberly Ohlund presiding.

04:50.258 --> 04:52.942
Denny Crane for the United States
of America, your honor.

04:52.942 --> 04:55.464
Donny Crane for the plaintiff Kavita Pokharel.

04:55.464 --> 04:57.265
I take it you two know each other.

04:57.265 --> 04:59.077
He's not my father.

04:59.112 --> 05:00.889
He's like a son.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.593
This will be a delight.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.272
I can't believe the squid
is working here now.

05:18.307 --> 05:19.841
The squid?

05:23.209 --> 05:27.783
In old mythology, they say the squid
is the only animal that can kill a shark.

05:27.783 --> 05:29.771
I used to work with her
at Howard and Brock.

05:29.771 --> 05:31.925
And like the mysterious giant squid,

05:31.925 --> 05:37.535
the only evidence of her existence were
the whopping sucker marks left on her victims.

05:40.928 --> 05:43.581
I take it you didn't get along.

05:43.616 --> 05:46.199
You don't get along with the squid.

05:46.234 --> 05:49.534
She used to tap into the computer network,
steal everyone's research memos

05:49.534 --> 05:51.379
and then claim them as her own.

05:51.379 --> 05:53.154
Why the hell did we hire her?

05:53.189 --> 05:55.012
Beats me.

05:55.286 --> 05:58.159
I only hope she doesn't get my Alan.

06:05.212 --> 06:07.967
I was pregnant with my second child.

06:13.104 --> 06:17.348
When I went into labor, my husband
took me to the district clinic in Khotang.

06:17.348 --> 06:18.772
This is in Nepal.

06:18.807 --> 06:20.111
Objection.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.270
The witness isn't speaking English.

06:22.305 --> 06:25.928
We're aware of that, Mr Crane.
She's being translated.

06:25.963 --> 06:27.185
Is that legal?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.213
Shocking, isn't it?

06:31.013 --> 06:32.422
Continue.

06:38.214 --> 06:41.022
It was the same clinic
where I had my first child,

06:41.022 --> 06:44.177
only this time, the doctor was gone.

06:49.519 --> 06:53.125
The medical assistant said
I had an obstetric fistula,

06:53.160 --> 06:55.475
and I needed a Cesarean section.

07:00.190 --> 07:04.288
But because they had no equipment
or medicine or a physician,

07:04.323 --> 07:06.843
they said there was nothing
they could do.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.253
I began to hemorrhage.

07:14.288 --> 07:18.336
I almost bled to death,
and my baby boy died.

07:22.133 --> 07:25.753
I'm not the only one.
Thousands are dying.

07:25.788 --> 07:27.648
Why weren't there any supplies?

07:33.400 --> 07:37.660
They told me the United States had
taken away all the clinic's funding.

07:39.641 --> 07:40.943
Edward Broden.

07:40.978 --> 07:45.464
And the man responsible for making
that decision was Mr Edward Broden.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.930
That man?

07:50.167 --> 07:51.830
Yes.

07:52.218 --> 07:57.439
I was a physician in Khotang
from 2001 until last October.

07:57.474 --> 08:02.660
Our clinic had been funded
primarily by the United States.

08:02.695 --> 08:04.744
Notice he didn't say thank you.

08:04.779 --> 08:06.794
He's got a lot on his mind, Denny.

08:06.794 --> 08:10.252
And, Dr Patel, did your clinic
perform abortions?

08:10.287 --> 08:12.853
No. Even though it is legal in Nepal,

08:12.888 --> 08:18.252
our clinic made the decision not to
in order to receive US funding.

08:18.287 --> 08:21.294
However, we hung up a poster that said,

08:21.329 --> 08:25.824
“we believe that a woman has a right
to control her own body”.

08:25.859 --> 08:29.412
The poster was meant
to promote women's rights

08:29.447 --> 08:32.929
and to prevent rape
as well as spousal abuse.

08:32.965 --> 08:39.826
But the US aid representative Mr Broden
felt the poster was pro-abortion.

08:39.861 --> 08:41.111
And that was that.

08:41.147 --> 08:43.980
We lost all of our funding.

08:48.185 --> 08:50.317
You're looking thin.
You should eat more.

08:50.317 --> 08:53.118
Some of us don't have fancy expense
accounts to pay for our meals, hmm?

08:53.118 --> 08:55.182
You should get one.
They're awesome.

08:55.182 --> 08:57.125
Mr Crane…

08:57.339 --> 08:59.338
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

09:00.027 --> 09:01.533
Doctor, um…

09:01.568 --> 09:02.728
Patel.

09:02.763 --> 09:05.854
I have in my hand here…

09:06.195 --> 09:10.999
a copy of the rules that clinics
must follow in order to get US aid.

09:11.034 --> 09:12.660
You, you've seen this manual?

09:12.660 --> 09:16.818
Yes, I have. But the rules in it
are so vague.

09:16.853 --> 09:20.693
They're left to the interpretation
of the US aid representative.

09:20.717 --> 09:23.439
And that representative
is hired by an appointee

09:23.439 --> 09:25.353
of the president of the United States,
is that correct?

09:25.353 --> 09:25.786
Yes.

09:25.787 --> 09:28.787
So, doctor, in your expert opinion
as a physician,

09:28.790 --> 09:31.750
who the hell are you to question
the president of the United States?

09:31.750 --> 09:33.040
Objection. Badgering.

09:33.075 --> 09:34.503
Sustained.

09:34.504 --> 09:37.981
You know the president
is against abortion.

09:38.016 --> 09:41.513
So in following the rules, it would seem that
you would err on the side of caution,

09:41.513 --> 09:44.542
but you didn't. You put up
an inflammatory poster.

09:44.577 --> 09:48.896
We didn't feel it was inflammatory
to protect the rights of women.

09:48.931 --> 09:50.524
Well, it got me mad.

09:50.559 --> 09:52.834
You have other clinics
that get our money, right?

09:52.834 --> 09:53.123
Yes.

09:53.124 --> 09:54.781
Ones who are able to follow the rules?

09:54.781 --> 09:56.792
The point is, Mr Crane,

09:56.827 --> 10:00.279
while you allow abortion
in your country,

10:00.314 --> 10:02.806
you are trying to deny it
to the rest of the world.

10:02.806 --> 10:05.264
The people of this country
never decided on abortion.

10:05.264 --> 10:07.391
The elected officials never voted on it.

10:07.391 --> 10:11.250
It was nine justices of the supreme court,
and people are still angry about it.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.320
Objection, he's not asking
a question. He's debating.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.356
–What are you talking about?
–The reason why—

10:15.356 --> 10:16.491
–I am not—
–the supreme court exists—

10:16.491 --> 10:19.423
is to protect people
from their own mob mentality,

10:19.423 --> 10:21.602
–which this issue triggers.
–I, I disagree. Objection. I disagree.

10:21.602 --> 10:23.746
–Fine. Objection right back at you.
–I, I object to your objections.

10:23.746 --> 10:27.722
Both objections are sustained. Move on.

10:30.375 --> 10:34.239
So doctor, uh…

10:34.274 --> 10:35.675
Patel.

10:35.710 --> 10:37.770
If you want American money,

10:37.805 --> 10:41.394
don't kill babies.

10:42.216 --> 10:45.140
She wasn't trying to.

10:53.343 --> 10:55.139
This is so disrespectful.

10:55.174 --> 10:58.244
You don't come home to papa
by suing his government.

10:58.244 --> 10:59.421
You're not my papa.

10:59.456 --> 11:03.821
Your sperm never touched my egg,
and someone has to sue the government.

11:03.856 --> 11:06.379
Look, our policy denies
thousands of people

11:06.379 --> 11:08.867
lifesaving medical care
based on the personal

11:08.867 --> 11:11.335
religious views of our leader.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.559
Nothing says “democracy” like imperialism.

11:13.559 --> 11:17.797
Why can't you come to town for once
and we just toss the pigskin around?

11:17.797 --> 11:19.868
That's American.

11:19.903 --> 11:21.278
Dinner?

11:21.313 --> 11:22.654
8 o'clock.

11:22.981 --> 11:24.352
Denny Crane.

11:24.387 --> 11:25.723
Donny Crane.

11:26.710 --> 11:28.491
Donny Crane.

11:35.075 --> 11:36.705
We had this settled.

11:36.740 --> 11:39.950
Upon further review of the agreement,
Mr Roth didn't approve.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.755
I don't know what game
you're playing here,

11:41.755 --> 11:43.525
but you're not getting
another dime from us.

11:43.525 --> 11:45.671
Please don't address my client directly.

11:45.671 --> 11:47.666
Talk to me.

11:50.380 --> 11:54.566
Your client should know that our
original offer was more than generous.

11:54.566 --> 11:56.612
That's not the way I see it.

11:56.807 --> 12:00.778
13 months ago, Derek went out on
a few dates with one Monique Foster,

12:00.778 --> 12:03.609
otherwise known at your web site,
datemistake.com, as anonymous.

12:03.609 --> 12:05.366
Things didn't work out
and he broke up with her.

12:05.366 --> 12:08.247
A few months later, he met someone else,
fell in love and got engaged.

12:08.247 --> 12:09.762
Things looked rosy.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.155
Yeah, until anonymous
found datemistake.com

12:12.155 --> 12:14.444
and started posting
all these lies about me.

12:14.444 --> 12:17.985
His fiancée found him
prominently displayed on the site
and broke up with Derek two days later.

12:17.985 --> 12:20.856
We all know what happened, Ms Stanger.
We reached the original settlement.

12:20.856 --> 12:22.932
What we didn't know
was the rest of the story.

12:22.932 --> 12:27.137
Now anytime someone tries to google
my name or my company,
“Roth's plumbing supply,”

12:27.137 --> 12:30.531
instead of finding my web site,
yours is the first site that comes up.

12:30.531 --> 12:33.053
My sales have dropped
40% since this posting.

12:33.053 --> 12:36.894
You could've posted a rebuttal,
responded to anonymous' opinions of you.

12:36.894 --> 12:38.591
But why should I have to?

12:38.626 --> 12:41.464
You destroy my client's reputation,
his business,

12:41.464 --> 12:45.633
you humiliate him in public, then force him
to fix the damages that you've caused.

12:45.633 --> 12:48.356
That's like a glass company throwing rocks
through your window then saying,

12:48.356 --> 12:51.089
“hey, need to buy a new window?”

12:51.502 --> 12:52.777
Hey.

12:52.812 --> 12:54.053
Nancy.

12:54.239 --> 12:55.437
Derek.

12:55.472 --> 12:57.410
Denise, right. You know everyone.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.018
I do.

12:59.260 --> 13:00.848
May I see you?

13:00.883 --> 13:02.436
Of course.

13:08.165 --> 13:12.104
What the hell are you doing
with my client?

13:12.139 --> 13:13.296
Well, Denise, uh,

13:13.331 --> 13:15.553
I was looking over some of
your settlement agreements,

13:15.553 --> 13:17.179
just to see how things worked
around here.

13:17.179 --> 13:20.568
Some firms are quite formal and sticklers
for grammar and language.

13:20.568 --> 13:23.922
I see around here anything goes,
which is fine, I just needed to know.

13:23.922 --> 13:26.980
What are you doing with my client?

13:27.015 --> 13:29.060
I looked at the settlement figure you had.

13:29.060 --> 13:30.725
I thought we could do better.

13:30.725 --> 13:33.194
I saw Denny was the assigned partner
in the case…

13:33.194 --> 13:35.629
You, you went to Denny behind
my back to steal my case?

13:35.629 --> 13:37.328
Oh, no, no. God, no.

13:37.363 --> 13:39.043
I just told him my thoughts.

13:39.054 --> 13:41.380
He was very encouraging
and told me to go for it.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.846
So I held the documents from being
published, made a few calls,

13:43.846 --> 13:44.952
and well, here we are.

13:44.952 --> 13:48.407
Our client is really, really happy
and I think we can ring these people up
for some big bucks.

13:48.407 --> 13:49.987
There's only one problem
with that, Marlene.

13:49.987 --> 13:51.833
Derek in there doesn't have a case.

13:51.833 --> 13:57.448
The $10,000 settlement I got him
was a gift from datemistake.com
to make him go away.

13:57.483 --> 13:59.843
I think we could get more,
and if you agree with me,

13:59.843 --> 14:03.377
I would love to share this case with you.

14:03.412 --> 14:06.911
We're leaving, as is our original offer.

14:07.511 --> 14:09.726
They'll be back.

14:47.185 --> 14:50.024
She just went to Denny
and stole my case.

14:50.059 --> 14:51.632
Just stole it.

14:51.667 --> 14:52.522
Okay.

14:52.557 --> 14:57.256
Did you know that at her old firm
they called her “the squid”?

14:57.257 --> 14:58.956
The squid?

15:00.748 --> 15:03.480
The only thing that can kill a shark?

15:03.515 --> 15:06.349
But what really gets me
about these people

15:06.384 --> 15:09.184
is how they're so
obvious and manipulative.

15:09.219 --> 15:12.613
And you're trying to manipulate
our friendship to get me to do
something about this.

15:12.613 --> 15:13.963
Yes.

15:13.998 --> 15:16.148
After she stole my case,

15:16.183 --> 15:19.130
she had the nerve to tell me
we could “share” it.

15:19.165 --> 15:22.493
Marlene is a first-rate lawyer.
She brings in a lot of money.

15:22.493 --> 15:25.069
She almost made partner
at Howard and Brock.

15:25.069 --> 15:27.395
We recruited her with the understanding

15:27.395 --> 15:29.311
that if she does as well here
as she did there,

15:29.311 --> 15:31.968
she would make partner
in the next vote.

15:32.003 --> 15:33.188
And you're okay with that?

15:33.188 --> 15:34.914
I am, yeah.

15:36.417 --> 15:41.491
Look, Denise, you have a
very bright future here but…

15:41.526 --> 15:45.255
let me put this as gently as I can.

15:45.572 --> 15:48.054
Toughen up.

15:58.110 --> 15:59.965
Are you seeing anyone?

16:00.451 --> 16:02.274
Not really. You?

16:02.309 --> 16:04.098
I got married.

16:04.291 --> 16:05.183
Married?

16:05.218 --> 16:06.076
For a day.

16:06.439 --> 16:11.149
We tried to contact you for the wedding,
but you were nowhere to be found.

16:12.421 --> 16:15.813
Um, question.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.761
Do the girls actually talk?

16:18.796 --> 16:21.059
I'm not quite sure of the etiquette here.

16:21.059 --> 16:24.707
I, I don't think there's
a question of etiquette, son.

16:24.742 --> 16:27.044
They're escorts.

16:27.625 --> 16:29.836
So you like flying around the world,

16:29.871 --> 16:32.906
picking up strangers,
bringing them to our courts?

16:32.941 --> 16:35.334
It isn't a matter of liking.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.441
I'm trying to make people understand.

16:37.441 --> 16:40.375
All these clinics forced
to close their doors

16:40.410 --> 16:43.344
by the simple stroke of the pen
of our president.

16:43.344 --> 16:44.829
Now here we are in Boston

16:44.829 --> 16:48.622
where there are eight world-class
hospitals within a 10-mile radius.

16:48.622 --> 16:50.742
We don't see it.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.086
I'm hoping Kavita will help us see it.

16:53.121 --> 16:55.396
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.797
I got the picture now.

16:56.832 --> 17:00.660
This is all about beating
your old man, isn't it, son?

17:01.646 --> 17:04.272
For once, this isn't about you.

17:04.308 --> 17:06.453
Then you won't mind losing.

17:06.488 --> 17:08.564
I've got the law on my side.

17:08.598 --> 17:12.497
Plus, the United States government
and Denny Crane.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.671
Two equal and unstoppable forces.

17:15.705 --> 17:18.776
And I've got a sympathetic judge

17:18.810 --> 17:22.763
and an honest woman
who lost her child.

17:23.234 --> 17:27.002
You always taught me,
emotion wins.

17:27.542 --> 17:30.064
Isn't he something?

17:37.406 --> 17:38.504
We're late.

17:38.539 --> 17:39.602
You're late.

17:39.637 --> 17:41.109
I'm not going.

17:41.349 --> 17:42.734
That time of the month?

17:42.769 --> 17:44.352
Come on.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.300
We're having fun.

17:46.814 --> 17:48.801
You're having fun,

17:48.836 --> 17:52.241
sweeping into court trying
a monumental case

17:52.276 --> 17:55.162
about which there is much
to be thoughtful, much to articulate,

17:55.162 --> 17:57.899
about which you know almost nothing.

17:57.934 --> 17:59.505
And you're using nothing

17:59.540 --> 18:03.681
but easy jokes, a swell suit
and blind patriotism.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.536
You're jealous of my son.

18:05.571 --> 18:08.512
Denny, you don't have a son,
and the truth is,

18:08.547 --> 18:12.990
you're making a complete ass
out of yourself in that courtroom
about something you shouldn't.

18:12.990 --> 18:15.056
I don't care to see it or support it.

18:15.056 --> 18:17.724
There's a difference between
being an ass and being effective.

18:17.724 --> 18:21.616
When you win, they say you're effective.
When you lose, which I never do,

18:21.616 --> 18:24.524
they call you an ass.

18:25.612 --> 18:28.080
I don't need you, Alan.

18:28.457 --> 18:30.808
I don't need anybody.

18:31.158 --> 18:32.924
Never have.

18:33.089 --> 18:35.156
Never will.

18:44.878 --> 18:49.458
I was in charge of the US aid office
in the Northeastern region of Nepal.

18:49.493 --> 18:53.824
Part of my job was to enforce
the rules of the Mexico city policy.

18:53.859 --> 18:55.125
What policy?

18:55.160 --> 18:57.530
Everything comes with rice and beans.

18:57.565 --> 19:02.302
No, the name of the policy in question
is the “Mexico city policy”.

19:02.337 --> 19:07.039
But opponents erroneously refer to it
as the “global gag rule”.

19:07.074 --> 19:09.077
All right. So what are we doing in Mexico?

19:09.077 --> 19:12.920
That's where president Reagan
first enacted the policy in 1984.

19:12.955 --> 19:16.009
It was enacted as a reaction
to forced abortions

19:16.044 --> 19:18.315
in China as a means of population control.

19:18.315 --> 19:20.947
Chinese, Mexican, anybody hungry?

19:20.982 --> 19:22.219
Objection.

19:22.254 --> 19:23.456
Sustained.

19:23.491 --> 19:25.016
All right, let's get back to America.

19:25.016 --> 19:29.558
Are you saying that these policies
were enacted as a humanitarian gesture?

19:29.593 --> 19:30.540
Yes, it was.

19:30.575 --> 19:36.799
And is it in the United States' discretion
to decide which clinics get funding?

19:36.834 --> 19:39.030
As a part of our
governmental function, yes.

19:39.030 --> 19:44.141
Determining funding is a
purely governmental function.

19:44.176 --> 19:51.408
And, uh, governments are
immune under the, uh…

19:51.708 --> 19:54.627
under the, uh…

19:57.544 --> 20:00.553
federal tort claims act.

20:00.588 --> 20:02.317
Right.

20:03.843 --> 20:06.575
Therefore…

20:06.987 --> 20:11.142
you will move for dismissal,
and I will again deny the motion.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.179
Move on.

20:15.852 --> 20:18.554
Nothing further, your honor.

20:29.803 --> 20:33.595
You, uh, you say this was done
as a humanitarian effort.

20:33.630 --> 20:37.388
However, the rule was instituted
by president Reagan,

20:37.423 --> 20:39.867
continued under the first president Bush,

20:39.867 --> 20:43.297
then rescinded during
the Clinton administration.

20:43.332 --> 20:44.258
That's true.

20:44.293 --> 20:46.636
And the day George W. Bush took office,

20:46.671 --> 20:52.728
reinstating the global gag rule was one
of his first official pieces of business.

20:52.763 --> 20:54.301
That sounds political to me.

20:54.301 --> 20:55.489
Objection, uh…

20:55.490 --> 20:56.707
Sustained.

20:56.742 --> 21:03.550
So the policy was designed to stop abortion
as a method of family planning?

21:03.585 --> 21:04.318
Yes.

21:04.353 --> 21:07.348
Even though, by withdrawing funding
from those clinics,

21:07.348 --> 21:10.243
they no longer have money
for any family planning,

21:10.243 --> 21:14.915
which could stop unwanted pregnancies
and the need for abortions?

21:14.950 --> 21:18.264
Mr Broden, you're not the only
US aid representative

21:18.299 --> 21:20.507
that has to deal with this issue, are you?

21:20.507 --> 21:21.777
No, I'm not.

21:21.812 --> 21:26.488
The truth is that our global gag rule
is affecting, well…

21:26.523 --> 21:28.119
the globe.

21:28.154 --> 21:31.441
The Balkans, Africa, South America, Asia,

21:31.476 --> 21:37.950
any place dependant on US funding is not
allowed to even utter the word “abortion”.

21:37.985 --> 21:39.376
Yes, that's true.

21:39.411 --> 21:41.574
So don't you think it's curious

21:41.609 --> 21:44.794
that in our administration's
quest to stop abortion,

21:44.829 --> 21:49.667
we're actually restricting free speech,
which is a hallmark of democracy?

21:49.702 --> 21:52.577
Objection. Irrelevant and unpatriotic.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.437
Sustained.

22:24.060 --> 22:26.705
datemistake.com.

22:26.740 --> 22:29.920
Thank goodness technology
has progressed to the point

22:29.941 --> 22:35.404
where we no longer have to deal
with our issues privately.

22:35.439 --> 22:40.501
So any of my misadventures
chronicled in there?

22:40.536 --> 22:41.961
No.

22:42.372 --> 22:43.623
Surprised?

22:43.658 --> 22:44.874
A little.

22:44.919 --> 22:48.435
As to the fact that
you checked on me, no.

22:58.172 --> 23:02.746
Just so you know, that little incident
would be considered sexual harassment.

23:02.746 --> 23:05.193
You're quite intoxicating. Oops.

23:05.228 --> 23:07.076
Did it again.

23:07.111 --> 23:10.201
But you won't report me
to the bosses.

23:10.236 --> 23:11.883
Why not?

23:11.918 --> 23:13.495
Marlene…

23:13.530 --> 23:15.161
while I haven't known you long,

23:15.161 --> 23:18.413
I get the feeling your best work
is done behind your colleague's back.

23:18.413 --> 23:21.599
If you were to report me, you certainly
wouldn't have warned me first.

23:21.599 --> 23:24.750
And besides, what you'd really like
to do is wrap your legs around me

23:24.750 --> 23:26.746
and scream at the top of your lungs.

23:26.746 --> 23:29.370
You're allowed one, aren't you?

23:29.405 --> 23:31.520
Excuse me?

23:34.960 --> 23:38.475
How about I just clear
everything off this desk?

23:38.721 --> 23:40.949
We can take care of things right now,

23:40.984 --> 23:44.973
then afterwards, you can write
me up and send me on my way.

23:45.749 --> 23:47.053
You're repulsive.

23:47.088 --> 23:48.358
You're right.

23:48.617 --> 23:52.894
And yet I can see in your eyes
you're not completely repulsed.

23:53.230 --> 23:56.501
And therein lies the rub.

24:14.104 --> 24:16.607
You can't hold someone liable
for expressing an opinion.

24:16.607 --> 24:18.380
And besides, truth is a defense.

24:18.380 --> 24:20.470
There are no objectively
false facts here.

24:20.470 --> 24:22.399
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

24:22.434 --> 24:24.293
Anonymous called me cheap.

24:24.328 --> 24:26.642
Where did you take
anonymous to dinner?

24:26.642 --> 24:27.684
Jimmy Changas.

24:27.719 --> 24:30.228
And is it true that
you used a coupon?

24:30.229 --> 24:32.765
Uh, that's not cheap.
That's smart.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.600
And did you pay?

24:34.635 --> 24:35.335
Yes, I did.

24:35.336 --> 24:37.433
And did she pay, too?

24:37.468 --> 24:38.917
Yes.

24:38.952 --> 24:40.856
He treated her as an equal,

24:40.891 --> 24:43.643
which only proves he's a feminist
as well as resourceful.

24:43.643 --> 24:45.425
Anonymous didn't post that
on there.

24:45.425 --> 24:47.724
Yeah, and she says I have
no sense of humor.

24:47.724 --> 24:49.435
I make jokes all the time.

24:49.470 --> 24:52.577
Those aren't jokes. Those are puns.
Puns aren't funny.

24:52.577 --> 24:55.019
Well, that's just your…

24:55.054 --> 24:56.995
opunion, isn't it?

24:57.030 --> 24:58.650
Oh, dear God.

24:58.685 --> 25:00.270
Look, Denise,

25:00.271 --> 25:04.209
we agreed to return to the table
in good faith based on your reputation,

25:04.209 --> 25:07.359
but you haven't given us any reason
to even go back to the original agreement.

25:07.359 --> 25:09.597
All of the facts are on our side.

25:09.632 --> 25:11.945
But we may have more
plaintiffs on our side.

25:11.945 --> 25:14.188
With just a quick search
on your web site,

25:14.188 --> 25:17.722
we have found ten men willing to come forward
who were defamed with false statements.

25:17.722 --> 25:20.323
It's a fact, not opinion.

25:21.689 --> 25:25.975
You never mentioned these men
in your previous negotiations.

25:26.010 --> 25:29.492
We were just focusing on our client, and
we were hoping you would be reasonable.

25:29.492 --> 25:31.196
But you're not being reasonable.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.222
So we're expanding this case
to a class action suit.

25:34.222 --> 25:36.002
As to the facts…

25:36.518 --> 25:40.186
Brett Doran does not still live
with his mother.

25:40.221 --> 25:45.836
Jack Bostick does not have a 1-inch
Johnson, even on a cold day.

25:45.871 --> 25:46.898
I could go on.

25:46.933 --> 25:52.324
There are 300,000 more postings and
plenty of eager associates to review them.

25:59.939 --> 26:03.809
We'll give you a chance
to talk this over. Marlene.

26:11.684 --> 26:14.289
You posted these complaints
yourself, didn't you?

26:14.289 --> 26:16.743
I'd have to be an idiot to do that.

26:16.778 --> 26:20.182
So you had someone else do it
for you. A sister, a girlfriend?

26:20.182 --> 26:22.789
Denise, while you were out
on a date last night,

26:22.789 --> 26:25.644
I was here until 3 o'clock in the morning
hunting these guys down.

26:25.644 --> 26:29.672
All it took was some hard work and
long hours, but I was willing to do it.

26:29.672 --> 26:30.945
Now we can go to court.

26:30.945 --> 26:33.355
The reward is potentially bigger,
but so are the risks.

26:33.355 --> 26:36.714
Or we can go back in there and get a bigger
settlement than you originally negotiated.

26:36.714 --> 26:38.637
Your call.

26:40.607 --> 26:42.236
I talk.

26:42.271 --> 26:44.469
You don't say anything.

26:48.129 --> 26:50.788
So, had the chance
to talk things over?

26:50.823 --> 26:52.134
As a matter of fact, we have.

26:52.134 --> 26:53.948
And?

26:54.663 --> 26:56.829
We don't like the way
you do business, Denise.

26:56.829 --> 26:58.925
And I don't like the way
Ms Moran does business.

26:58.925 --> 27:01.837
Your company trades on the misery
and pettiness of others.

27:01.837 --> 27:05.400
Ms Moran, there are two ways to
make money in a business like this.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.503
The first is the short-term
cash you make

27:07.503 --> 27:11.375
before someone like us comes in and
shuts you down with a major lawsuit.

27:11.375 --> 27:15.301
The other is the real money that comes
when you grow your business large enough

27:15.301 --> 27:18.351
that one of the big media
companies buys you out.

27:18.386 --> 27:20.033
But nobody's going to buy a company

27:20.033 --> 27:23.482
with a potentially huge class action
lawsuit hanging over its head.

27:23.482 --> 27:27.256
And that's why you were willing
to settle in the first place.

27:28.385 --> 27:31.974
$30,000 and this all goes away.

27:41.919 --> 27:43.102
$20,000.

27:43.137 --> 27:45.358
–$25,000.
–Done.

27:51.981 --> 27:54.316
I'll draw up the paperwork.

28:05.047 --> 28:07.338
You like hot fudge sundaes?

28:07.373 --> 28:09.629
Ah, who knows what you like?

28:09.664 --> 28:11.002
You're a weirdo.

28:11.037 --> 28:13.557
But my point is, people like
hot fudge sundaes.

28:13.557 --> 28:18.239
Well, yesterday in court,
I gave them a hot fudge sundae.

28:18.274 --> 28:20.237
I was brilliant.

28:20.408 --> 28:27.369
But after you've had a big,
delicious hot fudge sundae,

28:27.404 --> 28:30.094
it's a while before you want another one.
Are you with me so far?

28:30.094 --> 28:30.796
Let's say that I am.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.749
Great. I want you to do
the closing argument.

28:33.750 --> 28:34.489
I'm sorry?

28:34.524 --> 28:37.630
I gave the jury a great big
Denny Crane sundae

28:37.631 --> 28:44.203
with chocolate sauce and nuts and a cherry
on the top, and now they're full.

28:44.238 --> 28:49.103
I can't stuff another one
down their throats so soon.

28:49.138 --> 28:51.113
Denny, how'd it really go
in court yesterday?

28:51.113 --> 28:52.605
Magnificent.

28:52.640 --> 28:57.074
That being said, if the jury heard
from someone that wasn't me,

28:57.109 --> 29:01.508
it might refocus them in a way
that would guarantee victory.

29:01.543 --> 29:03.642
Not that victory is in doubt.

29:03.677 --> 29:05.538
I see.

29:06.002 --> 29:09.290
Alan, I need to stay undefeated.

29:09.325 --> 29:13.569
I don't want to look like
a fool in, in front of…

29:13.758 --> 29:16.383
I need you to do this.

29:18.402 --> 29:22.110
Friend helping friend.

29:32.426 --> 29:35.315
This case is not about abortion.

29:35.350 --> 29:38.170
It isn't about freedom of speech.

29:38.205 --> 29:42.639
It isn't even about what foreign policy
the United States chooses to conduct.

29:42.639 --> 29:47.009
This case is about hypocrisy
and the arrogance of power.

29:47.044 --> 29:51.379
Now under the laws of the United States,
abortion is legal.

29:51.414 --> 29:56.322
But we tell other countries
that if they want US aid,

29:56.357 --> 30:01.195
they cannot perform, encourage
or even mention abortion.

30:01.230 --> 30:07.941
We look the world in the eye
and say, “do as I say, not as I do”.

30:08.567 --> 30:11.924
It's the very essence of hypocrisy.

30:11.959 --> 30:15.382
So the clinic that Kavita Pokharel went to

30:15.417 --> 30:18.723
had had its funding cut off
by a US aid representative

30:18.758 --> 30:24.519
who mistakenly believed that a poster
in the clinic advocated abortion.

30:24.554 --> 30:28.262
She had been to the clinic before,
and everything had been fine.

30:28.262 --> 30:34.848
She had the reasonable expectation that
the clinic would continue to function.

30:35.075 --> 30:39.786
How could she, how could
anyone be expected to know

30:39.821 --> 30:45.982
that United States policy is
as changeable as the political winds?

30:47.601 --> 30:55.380
A political hack made a brutal, thoughtless
decision that could not be appealed.

30:57.644 --> 31:00.817
And Ms Pokharel's baby died.

31:00.852 --> 31:05.528
At a time when we're trying to spread
democracy around the globe,

31:05.563 --> 31:08.964
let us show the world that
we are not hypocrites.

31:08.999 --> 31:10.441
Let us show the world that

31:10.441 --> 31:14.976
when the government of the United States
makes a horrible, tragic mistake,

31:15.011 --> 31:22.965
the courts of the United States
will make that government pay for it.

31:48.101 --> 31:50.837
I'd like to begin with a cheer.

31:51.025 --> 31:52.833
We're number one.

31:52.868 --> 31:54.676
We're number one.

31:54.711 --> 31:56.449
We're number…

31:56.484 --> 31:58.416
it's not much of a cheer.

31:58.451 --> 32:01.313
It's repetitive and
rhythmically uninteresting,

32:01.348 --> 32:04.175
but it does succinctly
apply to our country,

32:04.210 --> 32:06.318
and has for quite some time.

32:06.353 --> 32:08.702
In fact, we've been
number one so long

32:08.737 --> 32:12.355
that the rest of the world has come to rely
on us. And we don't let them down.

32:12.355 --> 32:16.757
We're the world's largest donor
of development assistance.

32:16.792 --> 32:23.607
All in all, as a nation, we donate
over $55 billion a year in foreign aid.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.859
Money, money, money, money,
money, money, money, money.

32:25.859 --> 32:29.712
Everything is about money.

32:29.998 --> 32:36.721
But we must never forget that
there is a terrible human tragedy,

32:36.756 --> 32:39.821
at the center of all this.

32:41.589 --> 32:44.345
Ms Pokharel lost her child.

32:44.814 --> 32:49.972
The loss of any child's life
is an incalculable horror.

32:51.612 --> 32:53.142
It is for that reason

32:53.177 --> 32:59.267
that I would ask you to award
the plaintiff piles and piles of money.

32:59.302 --> 33:03.943
After all, we have so much to give away.

33:03.978 --> 33:05.846
Why not?

33:06.160 --> 33:09.520
Piles and piles.

33:10.151 --> 33:12.092
Thank you.

33:14.459 --> 33:16.137
You know…

33:16.172 --> 33:20.589
come to think of it, maybe we don't
have that much to give away, do we?

33:20.624 --> 33:25.976
Our national debt is now over $8 trillion.

33:26.731 --> 33:28.743
Eh, who cares?

33:28.778 --> 33:32.446
Give them piles anyway.
What the hell?

33:32.481 --> 33:36.079
Never mind that we have
37 million people

33:36.114 --> 33:38.817
living below the poverty line
right here at home.

33:38.817 --> 33:43.682
What does it matter that our own literacy rate
doesn't even rank in the top 50 countries?

33:43.682 --> 33:46.678
Just keep shelling out the foreign aid.

33:46.713 --> 33:51.549
Does it really bother anyone that we don't have
the resources to help the Katrina victims?

33:51.549 --> 33:54.222
Of course not. What's really important is,

33:54.257 --> 33:59.809
that the United States continue to be
that big ATM machine to the world,

33:59.844 --> 34:03.097
doling out wads of cash to
every country who wants it.

34:03.132 --> 34:04.525
Money, money, money, money,
money, money, money.

34:04.525 --> 34:05.915
Never mind we don't have it.

34:05.915 --> 34:08.217
These other nations,
they're entitled, aren't they?

34:08.217 --> 34:11.273
Even the ones who vilify us
for protecting their freedom,

34:11.273 --> 34:13.594
by the way, listening to plaintiff's counsel,

34:13.594 --> 34:17.344
I couldn't help but concur,
how horrible we Americans are.

34:17.380 --> 34:21.177
Okay, so we donate $55 billion
a year in foreign aid.

34:21.212 --> 34:24.975
But then we impose certain
conditions on those gifts.

34:25.010 --> 34:28.330
Imagine our awfulness.
And here, my God,

34:28.364 --> 34:32.726
we promised money to a clinic so long
as they promised not to promote abortion.

34:32.726 --> 34:35.503
So they did. How dare we not give them
the money just the same?

34:35.503 --> 34:37.925
We should've given them that
and then some.

34:37.925 --> 34:40.312
We have a duty to provide these handouts.

34:40.312 --> 34:43.014
we have an absolute duty,

34:43.050 --> 34:46.074
'cause we are the United States of America.

34:46.110 --> 34:48.989
And these other nations,
well, they're entitled,

34:49.004 --> 34:52.783
whether they keep
their promises or not.

35:22.816 --> 35:25.169
Our settlement check came in. 25 Gs.

35:25.204 --> 35:26.993
I'm just glad everything worked out.

35:26.993 --> 35:27.976
Me, too.

35:27.977 --> 35:31.912
But for all the strum and drang,
we really did make a pretty good team.

35:31.912 --> 35:34.011
I'm so glad we're not like
those women in the workplace

35:34.011 --> 35:36.796
who feel compelled to compete
with every pair of legs in a skirt.

35:36.796 --> 35:37.952
You know, Marlene,

35:37.987 --> 35:40.086
you are not gonna get very far
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt

35:40.086 --> 35:42.089
pulling the kind of crap
you did with this case.

35:42.089 --> 35:46.201
Denise, the only crap I pulled was to believe
in this case and invest myself in it.

35:46.201 --> 35:47.904
That's why we more than doubled our money.

35:47.904 --> 35:51.684
And I think that's why they hired me
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

35:51.828 --> 35:54.436
Why did they hire you?

35:55.190 --> 35:57.856
Anyway, see you later.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.090
Squid.

36:03.029 --> 36:04.938
Has the jury reached a verdict?

36:04.973 --> 36:06.236
We have, your honor.

36:06.271 --> 36:07.166
How say you?

36:07.167 --> 36:11.541
In the matter of Kavita Pokharel
vs the United States,

36:11.576 --> 36:14.781
we find in favor of…

36:14.816 --> 36:17.908
the United States of America.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.638
Thank you for your service.
We're adjourned.

36:20.673 --> 36:22.521
Still undefeated.

36:22.556 --> 36:24.611
I think my closing
made all the difference.

36:24.611 --> 36:28.076
Denny, if I wrote it and delivered it,
how did it become your closing?

36:28.076 --> 36:32.045
My case, I'm the lead attorney
and, of course, I'm…

36:32.080 --> 36:32.841
Yes, you are.

36:32.841 --> 36:34.848
the United States of America.

36:34.849 --> 36:36.203
Of course, we'll appeal.

36:36.203 --> 36:37.583
Of course, you'll lose.

36:38.737 --> 36:40.592
Dinner, Denny?

36:40.627 --> 36:42.448
Delighted, Donny.

36:51.137 --> 36:53.613
Son, let me ask you something.

36:54.964 --> 36:57.271
These lost causes…

36:57.306 --> 36:59.578
why do you do it?

37:00.310 --> 37:04.187
I suppose the struggle
gives me comfort.

37:05.011 --> 37:07.505
Why do you do what you do?

37:08.885 --> 37:11.371
I don't actually remember.

37:12.289 --> 37:16.790
It may have something to do with
the massive amounts of money I make.

37:22.635 --> 37:25.369
My mom died…

37:26.303 --> 37:28.939
uh, a few months ago.

37:28.974 --> 37:32.343
I, I was gonna tell you
the other night, but the…

37:32.378 --> 37:34.570
well…

37:35.177 --> 37:39.371
hookers made it a little uncomfortable.

37:44.168 --> 37:46.899
I went looking for my real father.

37:47.413 --> 37:49.072
And?

37:49.853 --> 37:51.907
Lives in Maine.

37:51.942 --> 37:54.348
He works on a cranberry bog.

37:54.383 --> 37:56.184
Good man.

37:56.219 --> 37:58.480
He wears waders.

37:58.515 --> 38:03.882
Most days, he's up to his knees
in water and little red fruits.

38:04.083 --> 38:06.722
Sounds like a very moist man.

38:11.553 --> 38:13.886
He's not you.

38:15.757 --> 38:18.780
Not the man I imagined growing up.

38:20.301 --> 38:26.542
Not the man I pictured in my mind
when I was studying in law school.

38:27.344 --> 38:29.950
So you're all alone.

38:31.137 --> 38:33.358
Yepper.

38:36.258 --> 38:37.931
So…

38:39.004 --> 38:42.683
any interest in being
my fake father again?

38:44.983 --> 38:48.718
I never stopped being
your fake father, son.

39:03.075 --> 39:04.835
Good night, Mr Crane.

39:04.870 --> 39:06.596
Good night, Ms Stanger.

39:15.236 --> 39:19.016
Your closing was very convincing,
almost as if you believed it.

39:19.028 --> 39:20.672
I did.

39:21.393 --> 39:22.771
You do love America.

39:22.806 --> 39:24.124
Of course I do.

39:24.125 --> 39:27.982
I didn't agree with the string our government
attached to the money in this case,

39:27.982 --> 39:31.805
but we have every right to attach
strings to the funds we give.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.929
That's my boy.

39:35.031 --> 39:38.319
I'm your friend, Denny,
but I'm not your boy.

39:38.354 --> 39:42.541
That's what troubles me, this notion that
we have to take sides in this country now,

39:42.541 --> 39:46.533
you're either with us or against us,
Republican or Democrat,

39:46.568 --> 39:48.391
red state or blue state.

39:48.426 --> 39:51.625
I can't believe I live in a blue state.

39:51.660 --> 39:56.214
No one looks at an issue and struggles
over the right position to take anymore.

39:56.214 --> 39:59.026
And yet, our ability to reason
is what makes us human.

39:59.026 --> 40:02.296
Lately we seem so willing
to forfeit that gift of reason

40:02.296 --> 40:05.531
in exchange for the good feeling
of belonging to a group.

40:05.531 --> 40:09.723
We all just take the position of our team.

40:09.758 --> 40:12.500
I've certainly done it
and hated myself for it.

40:12.500 --> 40:15.361
I've never heard you
make so much sense.

40:15.396 --> 40:19.633
I make sense all the time,
you just listen intermittently.

40:20.760 --> 40:22.825
Could be.

40:26.408 --> 40:28.898
I like that new girl.

40:28.933 --> 40:30.301
Marlene.

40:30.336 --> 40:32.333
She's got an aggressive eye.

40:32.368 --> 40:35.451
Bet she's magnificent in bed.

40:35.486 --> 40:39.960
Oh, I bet she's at her best
with her back against the wall.

40:44.392 --> 40:46.788
I can't wait till next week.
