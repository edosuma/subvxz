WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.740
Secretary of the u.S.
Navy is dead, captain.

00:07.742 --> 00:09.575
I knew when they got jarvis,
you were next.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.343
You're in danger, gibbs!

00:11.345 --> 00:13.779
Captain wayne:
<i>I got a call</i>

00:13.781 --> 00:16.181
To send agent gibbs to iran.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.617
Captain wayne, who paid you?
I don't know who it was.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.152
Parsa started a new terror cell.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.020
Who's their next target?

00:21.022 --> 00:22.087
Ziva david.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.288
If ziva's in trouble,

00:23.290 --> 00:24.790
A badge might
come in handy.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.792
If you know how
to get it to her, I'm game.

00:26.794 --> 00:27.760
Adam:
<i>You want me to track down</i>

00:27.762 --> 00:29.428
A former mossad operative

00:29.430 --> 00:30.763
Who has been trained
to disappear?

00:30.765 --> 00:31.730
Well, sure.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.499
Adam:
Ziva was here.

00:33.501 --> 00:36.435
How do you know it was ziva?
Because she told us.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.739
Talk to me, ziva.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.409
Where are you?

00:56.790 --> 00:58.624
Ziva.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.826
Don't worry, tony.

01:00.828 --> 01:03.095
We will be okay.

01:04.831 --> 01:07.766
Woman:
Are you okay?

01:07.768 --> 01:09.501
Do you want to get out?

01:11.704 --> 01:14.073
No. No, I'm good.

01:14.075 --> 01:16.608
Thanks.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.616
Agent dinozzo,

01:57.618 --> 01:59.384
If you'll come
with us, please?

02:01.721 --> 02:05.124
You guys selling
timeshares?

02:05.126 --> 02:07.126
Mossad. Enter the vehicle.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.828
We have information.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.763
It will be worth your while.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.207
Orli elbaz:
Agent dinozzo.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.609
Welcome back to israel.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.244
Thank you, director.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.579
Adam:
Hello, tony.

02:29.349 --> 02:30.883
Adam. You make the big move

02:30.885 --> 02:32.918
From shin bet to mossad,
or you just

02:32.920 --> 02:35.187
Here to say hi?
You know why
I'm here.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.156
Do I?

02:37.158 --> 02:38.257
Elbaz: Rest assured,
agent dinozzo,

02:38.259 --> 02:40.692
We are all focused
on one objective.

02:40.694 --> 02:41.894
What's that?

02:41.896 --> 02:44.329
Find ziva david.

02:46.599 --> 02:48.167
Agents, please come in.

02:49.369 --> 02:50.769
Secretary sarah porter,

02:50.771 --> 02:52.371
I'd like you
to meet our own

02:52.373 --> 02:54.173
Special agent leroy gibbs.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.808
Gibbs.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.210
I know the name.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.846
And fbi agent
tobias fornell.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.382
Madame secretary.
Still getting used
to the title.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.951
This appointment's been
bittersweet, to say the least.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.386
Clayton jarvis was a friend.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.654
To us, as well, ma'am.

03:08.656 --> 03:09.922
Well, then, what say

03:09.924 --> 03:12.224
We skip the formality,
and you bring me up to speed

03:12.226 --> 03:14.193
On this terror cell--
brotherhood of doubt?

03:14.195 --> 03:15.961
It certainly has an
ominous ring to it.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.629
Gibbs:
The hideout in arizona

03:17.631 --> 03:19.898
Turned up evidence,
no actual members.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.500
Vance:
Fbi, homeland,

03:21.502 --> 03:23.268
State police--
they're all on high alert.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.636
And their supposed leader?

03:26.239 --> 03:27.873
Name's benham parsa.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.942
He's a pakistani
national.
He's in the wind,

03:29.944 --> 03:32.277
Like the rest
of 'em.
But this man,

03:32.279 --> 03:33.478
Tomás mendez,

03:33.480 --> 03:34.913
Is on the board
of an american

03:34.915 --> 03:37.249
Anti-terror organization
that can link

03:37.251 --> 03:38.383
The brotherhood to parsa.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.220
That photo of mendez
was found pinned up

03:41.222 --> 03:42.554
In their compound.
Gibbs:
It's a good bet

03:42.556 --> 03:43.522
He's their next target.

03:43.524 --> 03:44.990
Can we protect him?

03:44.992 --> 03:46.658
We kept mendez in
a hotel last night.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.260
And I'm taking him
to a safe house

03:48.262 --> 03:49.328
As soon as we're done here.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.231
Don't let me keep you.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.799
Gentlemen, as you may know,
I'm not military.

03:55.335 --> 03:56.902
My background's business.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.437
And the first order
of business

03:58.439 --> 04:00.505
The president has appointed me
to address is

04:00.507 --> 04:01.974
Preventing further attacks.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.909
The second is
to bring swift justice

04:03.911 --> 04:07.379
To those committing them,
by any means necessary.

04:09.015 --> 04:11.316
Elbaz: These windows
were installed

04:11.318 --> 04:14.286
At the request of
my predecessor.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.355
He believed that
with light comes clarity.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.956
If you'll excuse me,
director,

04:17.958 --> 04:22.828
As much as I enjoy
abstract david family talk,

04:22.830 --> 04:24.997
Why don't you tell me
what you know?

04:24.999 --> 04:28.333
When was your last
communication with ziva?

04:28.335 --> 04:30.302
She's not mossad; not anymore.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.771
Why are you looking for her?
The same reason you are.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.006
I doubt that.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.841
All right, I will
give you that.

04:35.843 --> 04:40.612
Eli would have wanted me
to make sure she is safe.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.451
Shin bet identified
the three men

04:46.453 --> 04:48.820
That were found dead
at the david safe house.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.623
Common criminals,
no political affiliation.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.392
Hired guns.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.627
Presumably bought
by the same people

04:55.629 --> 04:57.629
Who tried to kill you
and agent gibbs.

05:00.366 --> 05:04.069
Do not tie my hands
with your mistrust.

05:04.071 --> 05:07.439
When was your last
communication with ziva?

05:09.409 --> 05:11.410
Two nights ago.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.645
She sent this.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.981
Poor, misguided ari.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.083
No message;
nothing since.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.452
And you are worried
that she is dead.

05:22.789 --> 05:24.956
Tony, this is a kibbutz

05:24.958 --> 05:27.092
Where ziva and
her siblings went as children.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.828
Yesterday, a teacher
there saw a woman

05:29.830 --> 05:32.631
Matching ziva's description
walking the grounds.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.766
The woman buried that
in one of the gardens,

05:34.768 --> 05:37.369
And then she fled.

05:37.371 --> 05:41.506
"I will ride a horse,
visit america."

05:41.508 --> 05:44.443
She wrote this as a kid?

05:44.445 --> 05:46.578
Both sets of handwriting
are ziva's, yes.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.780
But based on the ink saturation,

05:48.782 --> 05:51.750
The x and the last item
were added fairly recently.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.652
"stop this for him."

05:53.654 --> 05:55.454
What does that mean? Stop what?

05:55.456 --> 05:57.856
That is what concerns us.

06:07.568 --> 06:12.003
The director said that we...
Yeah, the director said
to check it out.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.538
Listen, she's been
shuffling me around

06:13.540 --> 06:14.773
Since I got off the plane.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.609
Does that sound like
trustworthy behavior to you?

06:17.611 --> 06:20.679
That's the apartment
where ziva grew up.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.416
She brought me here
once, to show me.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.954
Listen...

06:28.956 --> 06:31.390
When I asked you
to look for her...

06:31.392 --> 06:33.058
Thank you.

06:51.110 --> 06:52.177
Tony.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.179
This is it.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.819
(speaking hebrew)

07:00.821 --> 07:02.187
Hello?

07:02.189 --> 07:03.789
Anybody home?
(woman speaks hebrew)

07:03.791 --> 07:07.092
(speaking hebrew)

07:09.061 --> 07:10.128
(speaking hebrew)

07:10.130 --> 07:11.663
Government agents?

07:11.665 --> 07:13.799
Can you put the hammer
down, please?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.901
I'm sorry.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.569
I-I... I was
carrying groceries.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.037
I must have forgotten
to close the door.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.639
Are you dr. Deena bashan?

07:20.641 --> 07:22.674
Yes.

07:22.676 --> 07:23.708
What is this about?

07:23.710 --> 07:26.044
Ziva david.
You know her?

07:26.046 --> 07:27.679
I have known her my whole life.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.681
We grew up in this
building together.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.982
Is she okay?

07:33.186 --> 07:34.653
Gibbs:
Hey.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.021
Thought you left a while ago.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.857
I was trying,
but, uh, mr. Mendez here

07:38.859 --> 07:40.992
Has been
slow to embrace

07:40.994 --> 07:42.761
The concept of
protective custody.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.863
I'm not afraid
of these bastards.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.131
It's not about fear.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.533
I do business all over
the country, agent gibbs.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.869
Any alterations
to my schedule-- to my life--

07:50.871 --> 07:53.171
Would be a victory
for the brotherhood.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.073
These are special
circumstances.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.143
Special only if we allow the
terrorists to make them so.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.811
Look, don't be a dumb ass.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.813
You keep agent fornell
in your hip pocket,

08:01.815 --> 08:03.114
Or you're a dead man.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.984
For freedom, I'd hardly
be the first to die.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.087
But very well.

08:09.089 --> 08:13.592
I spent the last hour saying
pretty much the same thing.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.227
Then let's hope

08:15.229 --> 08:18.864
You're better at protection
than you are at persuasion.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.999
Save me.

08:23.102 --> 08:25.770
I inherited this place
from my parents.

08:25.772 --> 08:28.673
The davids lived
across the hall.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.142
I was older than ziva,
but I looked up to her.

08:31.144 --> 08:34.145
Even then,
she was a force.

08:34.147 --> 08:38.817
Determined, inquisitive,
stubborn as a mule.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.252
Sounds about right.

08:40.254 --> 08:42.120
Forgive me, agent dinozzo.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.855
I'm babbling, and
you have questions.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.957
Please.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.158
When was the last time
you saw her?

08:47.160 --> 08:49.794
It was, uh, months ago.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.696
At her father's funeral.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.541
Where did you get this?

09:02.543 --> 09:03.642
You have seen it before?

09:03.644 --> 09:05.877
(laughs)
I had one, too.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.113
This was, uh, ziva's.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.715
We were so young,
we were just learning english.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.251
We called them
our "wills."

09:13.253 --> 09:17.122
Our teacher said that if we
buried our wishes in the ground

09:17.124 --> 09:19.157
And thought about
them every night,

09:19.159 --> 09:21.059
They would become truth.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.730
Why is it crossed out?

09:25.732 --> 09:27.032
We do not know.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.733
"stop this for him."

09:28.735 --> 09:31.303
Do you know what it means?

09:32.939 --> 09:34.239
I know
that her work is dangerous.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.241
Please, just tell me.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.977
We are doing all that we can
to make sure she is safe.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.280
Thank you for the tea, doctor.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.754
Um...

09:49.756 --> 09:51.323
You all right?

09:51.325 --> 09:54.259
Yes. It's just, uh...

09:54.261 --> 09:56.962
She mentioned you
at the funeral.

09:58.998 --> 10:02.100
I could see what she felt.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.969
"stop this for him."

10:05.805 --> 10:07.672
Perhaps the "him" is you.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.277
Mcgee:
<i>"I will be a ballerina."</i>

10:12.279 --> 10:13.778
I don't get it.
This is ziva.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.280
Shouldn't it say "ninja"
or something?

10:15.282 --> 10:18.016
(whispering): Apparently, there
was a pre-ferocious phase.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.784
Huh.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.219
So, how's this list about you?

10:21.221 --> 10:23.288
I don't know if it is.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.824
It's a long story. I...
Why are you whispering?

10:25.826 --> 10:28.326
Because
I'm in mossad headquarters.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.662
So you're working together,
but you're whispering because...

10:30.664 --> 10:32.864
I don't know. It's mossad.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.833
It just felt right.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.301
Well, I got to say,

10:36.303 --> 10:38.870
Access to their resources
will be a huge help.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.939
Yeah, but who knows
how long that's gonna last.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.340
I need an angle.

10:42.342 --> 10:45.276
What's my angle?
Give me an angle, mcgee.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.345
We got a trace
on the last text ziva sent you.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.348
Ooh. That's good.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.950
Ari picture.
Where was she?

10:51.952 --> 10:53.885
Connected to a wifi
at an internet cafe

10:53.887 --> 10:55.387
In the center of tel aviv.

10:55.389 --> 10:56.855
You got an address?

10:56.857 --> 10:58.256
Check your inbox.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.059
Well, hey. Look at that.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.794
Mcloving you long-distance.

11:06.932 --> 11:08.400
Gibbs: Bullets give us
anything, abbs?

11:08.402 --> 11:11.269
Um, standard .308 winchesters.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.104
Anyone could
buy them online.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.939
And there's nothing
to tie them to this...

11:14.941 --> 11:18.209
Stupid brotherhood
of doubt thing.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.879
The name is such a downer.
I don't even like saying it.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.314
What is this?
It's just a little

11:23.316 --> 11:25.850
Mock-up I made to try
to make sense out of stuff.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.186
Bullet trajectories?
Yeah, all the slugs

11:28.188 --> 11:29.721
From tony's apartment

11:29.723 --> 11:31.056
Landed at the
same angle

11:31.058 --> 11:32.891
And came from the same
point of origin.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.325
Rooftop across the street.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.094
Well, that's what homeland says.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.729
So what doesn't
make any sense?

11:37.731 --> 11:39.731
Their lone witness said

11:39.733 --> 11:43.902
That he saw someone on the roof,
just after the shots were fired.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.838
But there's no one
and nothing there.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.740
Can you beam this up to mcgee?

11:48.742 --> 11:51.910
Well, I can't "beam it,"
captain kirk, but I could

11:51.912 --> 11:54.846
Send it up, sure.
Captain who?

11:59.919 --> 12:01.786
Mcgee:
The witness is a maintenance man

12:01.788 --> 12:03.455
In the building
where the shots were fired from.

12:03.457 --> 12:05.757
Gerald carlin.

12:05.759 --> 12:08.960
Claims he was on his lunch break
when he glanced out a window

12:08.962 --> 12:10.462
And saw a figure running
from the roof.

12:10.464 --> 12:13.131
He saw his own roof
from his own building?

12:13.133 --> 12:14.466
How does that work?

12:14.468 --> 12:16.801
It doesn't.
Where was the lunch?

12:16.803 --> 12:18.436
Mcgee:
Thought you'd ask that.
He was at a bar

12:18.438 --> 12:20.472
Across the street
called clancy's.

12:20.474 --> 12:22.107
Bartender confirms

12:22.109 --> 12:23.842
Carlin was there
eating a turkey club,

12:23.844 --> 12:25.443
Glancing out the window

12:25.445 --> 12:27.178
When he heard
the shots.
Were there drinks?

12:27.180 --> 12:28.413
Four beers, two tequilas.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.782
So he wasn't seeing
anything too clearly.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.417
Or he was paid
to see what he saw.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.786
Okay, so if...

12:34.788 --> 12:37.288
The shots didn't come
from the roof,

12:37.290 --> 12:38.957
They had to have come
from the top floor.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.458
Homeland interview tenants?

12:40.460 --> 12:41.793
Top floor...

12:41.795 --> 12:43.061
All but one.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.996
Lisa pierway.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.364
She never answered the door.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.135
Gibbs:
<i>Ncis!</i>

12:52.304 --> 12:55.507
Lisa pierway?

12:55.509 --> 12:58.176
Boss, you smell that?

13:02.148 --> 13:04.816
Boss?

13:25.538 --> 13:28.840
There are signs
of an intense struggle before

13:28.842 --> 13:30.408
She was strangled.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.044
Shooter didn't even bother
to make it look like a robbery.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.213
Lisa pierway was
a pharmaceutical rep.

13:35.215 --> 13:38.216
Boxes of drug samples
left untouched in her closet.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.484
Guy was a pro.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.086
Cleaned up after himself.
No prints.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.222
Don't be too sure, jethro.
What I thought at first

13:44.224 --> 13:47.125
Were petechiae
in ms. Pierway's eyes,

13:47.127 --> 13:50.395
Were actual
subconjunctival hemorrhages,

13:50.397 --> 13:53.998
Likely caused
by the killer's thumbs.

13:54.000 --> 13:54.999
He eye-gouged her.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.268
Yes, a bully tactic,
indeed.

13:57.270 --> 14:01.339
But one that may prove
perversely fortunate.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.273
Thumbprints.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.009
She's wearing contact lenses.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.846
If abby can pull even
a partial off one of them,

14:07.848 --> 14:10.949
(phone ringing)
we just may find our killer.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.350
Yeah, tobias, what's up?

14:12.352 --> 14:15.386
Fornell:
<i>Protecting ricky ricardo</i>
<i>is not all</i>

14:15.388 --> 14:16.888
Conga drums and "babalu,"
you know.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.323
It's only
been two days.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.458
And mendez already has himself
a full dance card.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.594
In the next few weeks,
he'll be wining and dining

14:22.596 --> 14:24.395
Every big shot in town
supporting that

14:24.397 --> 14:26.064
Anti-terrorism group
he's part of.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.333
And I'll be right there
in his hip pocket.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.468
Tobias, you can always say no.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.469
Well, that's the kicker.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.071
My boss says I can't.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.340
The guy's not
a-a gangster, gibbs.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.375
He's a law-abiding
millionaire

14:37.377 --> 14:39.878
Out to save the world
with his powerful friends.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.146
And my job is to say yes.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.514
Banana pancakes, extra bacon.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.350
Could I get...

14:45.352 --> 14:47.252
Extra extra bacon?

14:50.222 --> 14:52.223
Breakfast anytime?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.392
I crave banana pancakes
when I get agitated.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.128
And nothing agitates me more
than a hospital visit.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.897
You might want to cut back
on the bacon.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.265
It's not me.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.066
Lawrence walters.

15:02.068 --> 15:05.303
Philanthropist billionaire
losing a battle with cancer.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.138
He wants
to donate a bundle

15:07.140 --> 15:09.540
To the anti-terror campaign
before he departs.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.609
Mendez plans
to visit later today.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.145
Seems like a guy
worth visiting.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.348
And that's
how you cheer people up?

15:17.350 --> 15:20.151
All I feel
is more shallow.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.352
Extra bacon.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.023
He's on me.
Keep the change.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.257
Thanks.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.425
Your treat?

15:27.427 --> 15:28.559
Hey.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.261
You wanted cheering up.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.329
And you think you can buy me?

15:31.331 --> 15:33.498
(laughs)

15:33.500 --> 15:36.134
Who am I kidding?

15:36.136 --> 15:38.036
Of course he can.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.472
(sighs)

15:41.474 --> 15:44.342
There's no way ziva spends
all day at some internet cafe.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.946
Go back to the time she
sent the text, check again.

15:51.183 --> 15:53.184
Any luck?

15:53.186 --> 15:55.653
We're gonna have
to make our own.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.722
Would you care to elaborate?

16:00.292 --> 16:02.393
I'm heading to the cafe
to see if anybody

16:02.395 --> 16:04.228
Remembers her coming in.

16:04.230 --> 16:07.065
Tell the driver
shamayim hospital.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.467
It will be easier.
The cafe is across the street.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.369
From the hospital?

16:11.371 --> 16:14.339
Yes. Why?
The night before ziva sent
the picture, she was

16:14.341 --> 16:16.207
Attacked at the safe house.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.276
You think she was seeking
medical attention?

16:18.278 --> 16:21.379
I'll bet you that wifi signal
reaches across the street.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.281
Give me an angle
favoring the hospital.

16:26.518 --> 16:27.752
Tony:
That's pretty impressive.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.455
Mossad got eyes
all over the city?

16:30.457 --> 16:33.424
All over the world,
agent dinozzo.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.527
It is our job to see.

16:39.465 --> 16:40.465
That's her.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.432
Blow that up.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.302
There she is.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.204
To whom is she speaking?

16:48.340 --> 16:49.540
Dr. Bashan.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.109
She lied.

16:53.078 --> 16:56.581
Hey. Hear you pulled
a thumbprint.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.517
It's just a partial.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.518
Yeah?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.553
Partial enough?

17:02.555 --> 17:03.554
Enough to get a name.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.523
Henry coldwell.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.657
The record says he was

17:06.659 --> 17:08.493
Dishonorably
discharged from

17:08.495 --> 17:11.462
The army in '06, after serving

17:11.464 --> 17:13.398
Two years for
aggravated assault

17:13.400 --> 17:15.500
But not before he got
sniper training.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.502
That's our shooter.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.337
Well, I'm sure
if you asked mcgee

17:19.339 --> 17:20.671
He can probably
tell you more.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.673
Probably even find him.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.275
That's good news, abbs.

17:26.745 --> 17:28.446
What's wrong?

17:28.448 --> 17:30.581
Well... You yourself said

17:30.583 --> 17:34.052
That parsa is paying
hired guns and bombers.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.054
I mean, this guy could just be
some flunky.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.222
A flunky that leads to parsa.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.258
I don't know, gibbs.
I think... I just think

17:40.260 --> 17:41.826
All this worrying
is finally getting to me.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.729
Tony getting
shot at, and...

17:44.731 --> 17:47.565
Ziva, where is she?

17:47.567 --> 17:49.767
If I can't
figure out who's

17:49.769 --> 17:52.170
Trying to kill
everyone I love, I'll...

17:52.172 --> 17:54.172
Never forgive herself.
This...

17:54.174 --> 17:55.573
Is a good start.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.276
Yeah, but, gibbs,
it's a brotherhood.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.578
Which means that that jerk
has brothers.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.646
Yes.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.615
We're gonna get 'em.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.685
We're gonna get 'em all.

18:11.223 --> 18:14.158
(indistinct chatter)

18:14.160 --> 18:15.460
You lied to me.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.495
Agent dinozzo.
What are you doing here?

18:17.497 --> 18:19.530
You said you hadn't
seen ziva in months-- hey.

18:20.632 --> 18:22.500
You think you're protecting her?

18:22.502 --> 18:24.502
I'm on her side.
I know that.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.237
Then why did you lie to me?

18:27.639 --> 18:29.807
She came to me
after she had been attacked.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.542
I stitched up the
wound in her leg

18:31.544 --> 18:34.145
And took her to my home
so that she could rest.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.180
But then, uh...

18:36.182 --> 18:37.548
Then what?
I thought I could

18:37.550 --> 18:40.184
Save both of us the
heartache by keeping quiet,

18:40.186 --> 18:42.653
But she then she started
to talk of old times.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.823
Of ari.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.493
She did not know that when
she went off to save the world,

18:48.495 --> 18:52.130
I was here, falling in love
with her brother.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.866
He was going to propose to me

18:54.868 --> 18:57.401
When she killed him.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.737
And you told her that.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.606
Yes.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.542
And she tried
to explain it away.

19:04.544 --> 19:08.179
She said that he was
hurting good people.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.814
But ari was also hurt.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.416
His father had broken him.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.886
Still...

19:14.888 --> 19:18.289
I saw the smiling boy
from across the hall.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.691
The good boy.

19:20.693 --> 19:24.695
Ziva begged me to forgive her.

19:24.697 --> 19:27.732
I could not.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.800
Where did she go?
I do not know.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.802
Don't lie to me.
I didn't do anything wrong.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.172
You knew she was in danger,
and you lied to me.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.373
I asked you point blank.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.241
And had any other agent
come to the door,

19:37.243 --> 19:38.676
I would have said yes.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.348
Why should she have
the man that she loves...

19:46.618 --> 19:48.819
...When she took
mine from me?

19:50.722 --> 19:52.657
I'm gonna find her.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.659
Ziva is gone, agent dinozzo.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.762
When she left me that night,
she was not the same person.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.641
So that's it, huh?

20:10.643 --> 20:13.644
We believe that ziva's absence
is voluntary,

20:13.646 --> 20:15.746
And so do you.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.750
Everything mossad has

20:19.752 --> 20:22.486
On known david
family contacts.

20:22.488 --> 20:23.688
Good luck.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.756
Director...

20:28.660 --> 20:31.662
She left something
at the safe house.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.565
Can you help me get it back?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.701
Check the file.

20:54.886 --> 20:57.321
Fornell: You just stay close
to us, mendez.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.956
Follow the route
to the icu as planned.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.726
Once inside, you've got
30 minutes with walters.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.794
Windows closed, drapes drawn;
we've been through this.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.930
And you don't talk to anybody
else without one of us present.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.431
(phone ringing)
not even on your cell phone.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.799
May we get in there, please?

21:08.801 --> 21:09.834
The poor man doesn't
have much time.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.270
What did I just say

21:12.272 --> 21:13.738
About phones?
You're here with me.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.706
This is business.
Won't be a second.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.714
(car alarms wailing)

21:35.027 --> 21:36.861
Gibbs:
<i>Where is he?</i>

21:36.863 --> 21:38.029
Tried him twice, boss.

21:38.031 --> 21:39.297
He's not picking up.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.298
Try him again.

21:46.905 --> 21:49.440
Uh, yeah, I'm here.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.042
Hey, boss.
Mcgee:
Oh, that beard's
getting pretty serious.

21:51.044 --> 21:53.611
When was the last time
you shaved-- cairo?

21:53.613 --> 21:55.479
I guess so. I...

21:55.481 --> 21:56.814
Meant to do that this morning.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.416
Hey, this a bad
time for you,

21:58.418 --> 22:00.051
Dinozzo?
Tony:
No, boss.

22:00.053 --> 22:01.652
It's good. I'm ready.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.087
You still in yemen?

22:03.089 --> 22:05.356
Israel. Circled back
to tel aviv.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.757
Just got to be'er sheva.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.326
One of ziva's contacts,

22:08.328 --> 22:10.394
Uh, nava adi, told me

22:10.396 --> 22:12.330
That, uh, she saw her last week.

22:12.332 --> 22:15.099
I'm getting close.
I can feel it.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.767
You said that
two months ago.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.936
So, what about you guys?

22:18.938 --> 22:20.838
My sniper friend
pop his head up?

22:20.840 --> 22:22.473
Coldwell.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.974
Nope. Still off the radar.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.776
Old man walters?

22:25.778 --> 22:28.512
Hanging in there; no excitement
since the explosion.

22:28.514 --> 22:31.449
About how he would
have been a goner

22:31.451 --> 22:32.583
If mendez hadn't
taken that call.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.752
As far as parsa goes...
Enough.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.620
Unless he booked
his flight home,

22:36.622 --> 22:38.122
An update's wasted on him.

22:38.124 --> 22:41.359
You want me to
give up on ziva?

22:41.361 --> 22:42.660
I didn't say that.

22:42.662 --> 22:43.828
Are you giving up on her?

22:43.830 --> 22:45.996
I didn't say that, either.

22:45.998 --> 22:49.567
Boss, maybe you could try
saying what you're saying?

22:49.569 --> 22:53.037
If ziva doesn't want
to be found,

22:53.039 --> 22:55.439
You aren't going
to find her.

22:55.441 --> 22:58.876
I'm saying
you should respect that.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.545
I do. I just...

23:03.548 --> 23:06.517
I need to go off the grid
for a few days,

23:06.519 --> 23:09.120
Follow this lead.

23:09.122 --> 23:10.621
I just need a little more time.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.456
You do what you have to do.

23:16.428 --> 23:18.129
(computers blip off)

23:18.131 --> 23:20.398
(sighs)

23:20.400 --> 23:22.833
You know how hard that was.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.771
Gibbs was wrong.

23:26.773 --> 23:31.041
I did not want you to
find me and yet, you did.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.511
I should have told him.

23:36.782 --> 23:38.582
You cannot beat down
my door one minute,

23:38.584 --> 23:41.185
And expect me to face my
old life again the next.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.686
Hey!

23:44.723 --> 23:47.525
I had to take the call.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.727
You did not have
to do any of this.

23:52.597 --> 23:53.731
Why are you here?

23:53.733 --> 23:55.966
Because you invited me.

23:55.968 --> 23:58.002
That was before.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.570
Before what?

24:00.539 --> 24:02.973
You should not have come.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.449
Our people have been working
day and night, madame secretary.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.083
I'm sure they have, director.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.453
But the president needs progress
in this case-- results.

24:15.455 --> 24:18.489
And after months
of nothing...
Ma'am, if I may.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.958
A little help from
you wouldn't hurt.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.726
Gibbs...

24:22.728 --> 24:24.061
No, please.

24:24.063 --> 24:27.231
Agent gibbs,
with your reputation,

24:27.233 --> 24:30.501
I expected parsa to be
disposed of long before now.

24:30.503 --> 24:33.504
So, do tell me, please, what
sort of help am I not providing?

24:33.506 --> 24:34.905
Influence.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.507
My reputation aside,

24:36.509 --> 24:38.809
There's only one guy
who's not cooperating,

24:38.811 --> 24:40.478
And he's the
only one we know

24:40.480 --> 24:41.812
Who has any direct
contact with parsa.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.981
Captain wayne.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.750
Relieved of his duties at jsoc.
He lawyered up.

24:46.752 --> 24:48.519
Wayne may be
dead to jsoc.

24:48.521 --> 24:49.854
He is not dead to us.

24:49.856 --> 24:52.723
And certainly not to you.

24:52.725 --> 24:56.727
That tour of iran he set you up
on must have left an impression.

24:56.729 --> 25:01.532
A call from you may get us
some interagency cooperation.

25:01.534 --> 25:03.167
Count on it.
In fact, why wait?

25:03.169 --> 25:04.735
Put me through right now.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.738
(phone keypad beeping)
this is director vance.

25:07.740 --> 25:10.674
Please hold for
the secretary of the navy.

25:19.217 --> 25:22.586
(sighs)

25:32.264 --> 25:34.698
Old friend.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.200
Thank you.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.602
You asked how I found you.

25:38.604 --> 25:42.940
For a long time,
I was looking ahead.

25:42.942 --> 25:47.244
I kept telling myself,
"you know how she thinks.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.079
"you know her.

25:49.081 --> 25:52.249
All you have to do is
anticipate her next move."

25:52.251 --> 25:54.785
And then one night,
I had a dream.

25:54.787 --> 25:57.655
Everything was all
lined up together.

25:57.657 --> 26:01.091
Your family's safe house,
ari's picture, you,

26:01.093 --> 26:02.693
Your old friend bashan.

26:02.695 --> 26:05.029
And when I woke up,
I knew.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.664
You weren't looking ahead.

26:06.666 --> 26:08.866
You were looking back.

26:12.137 --> 26:14.638
I tracked you down to amman,

26:14.640 --> 26:17.308
Where your mother
was killed.

26:17.310 --> 26:21.845
And then, your grandparents'
graves in meron.

26:21.847 --> 26:26.150
The opera house in cairo
where you took tali.

26:26.152 --> 26:29.320
And finally,

26:29.322 --> 26:30.721
I found you here.

26:30.723 --> 26:33.023
Of course.

26:34.659 --> 26:37.227
The house where
you were born.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.630
After my father died,

26:39.632 --> 26:43.067
Returning to these places
seemed... Necessary.

26:43.069 --> 26:45.803
It started off as a good thing,

26:45.805 --> 26:49.607
But then I saw
deena bashan, and...

26:49.609 --> 26:52.042
(sighs)
this all can't be
because of her.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.744
No, it's not because of her.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.079
It's because of me.

26:55.081 --> 26:57.214
You had to kill ari.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.617
One person loving him
doesn't change that.

26:59.619 --> 27:01.318
Yes, but I loved him.

27:01.320 --> 27:05.222
Just as I loved my father
and my mother and tali.

27:05.224 --> 27:08.692
How can I not think
that for every man I killed,

27:08.694 --> 27:11.128
There is someone out there
crying for him?

27:11.130 --> 27:12.663
It's part of the job.

27:12.665 --> 27:13.764
You gotta leave it at that.

27:13.766 --> 27:16.133
Deena blamed me.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.268
I thought that by going
back to these places,

27:18.270 --> 27:20.270
I would someone erase
all of that,

27:20.272 --> 27:22.106
But each stop
just made it clearer.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.707
She was right.

27:23.709 --> 27:25.809
The center
of all this pain is me.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.012
Ziva, this isn't you.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.813
This <i>is</i> me, tony.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.316
This is what I made of myself.

27:33.685 --> 27:37.321
But it's not who I wanted to be.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.857
I know.

27:42.060 --> 27:43.427
I know.

27:48.066 --> 27:51.201
(paper rustling)

27:51.203 --> 27:53.771
You wanted to
be a ballerina.

27:57.876 --> 28:00.244
"stop this for him."

28:00.246 --> 28:03.847
Who? Ari? Eli?

28:03.849 --> 28:05.449
God?

28:05.451 --> 28:07.217
This was supposed
to stay buried.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.119
Orli was looking
for you, too.

28:11.756 --> 28:14.358
This little girl was strong.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.094
She could've walked away
from her father's world.

28:17.096 --> 28:20.431
Things would have
been different.

28:22.233 --> 28:23.801
It's never too late.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.206
Yes, it is.

28:34.379 --> 28:38.215
This is the house
that you were born in.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.250
The universe is
practically begging you

28:40.252 --> 28:42.753
To wipe the slate clean.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.991
I did notice
that there's plenty of room

28:47.993 --> 28:51.729
On the back of this list...

28:51.731 --> 28:54.031
To start a new one.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.835
Maybe I could
help you with that.

29:03.341 --> 29:05.342
Captain wayne:
<i>I'm so sorry, gibbs.</i>

29:05.344 --> 29:06.810
Gibbs:
<i>You save your marriage?</i>

29:06.812 --> 29:08.912
My kids won't even
talk to me.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.148
Wasn't quite worth it,
then, was it?

29:11.150 --> 29:14.084
Look, I'm just waiting
on my trial date.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.220
Trying to put
this whole thing behind me.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.155
Nothing is behind you, wayne.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.090
Nothing is behind
any of us.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.925
You got to
start talking.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.160
Who are these guys?

29:23.162 --> 29:24.528
Where is parsa?

29:24.530 --> 29:26.330
All I got
were text messages.

29:26.332 --> 29:28.799
I tried using jsoc
to attach some names,

29:28.801 --> 29:31.034
But all the calls
came back unlisted.

29:31.036 --> 29:33.437
Just a... A 305 area code.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.072
305?

29:35.074 --> 29:37.908
Look, I know arizona is where
you found a hideout,

29:37.910 --> 29:41.245
But all communication
to me came through florida.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.880
Anything else?

29:46.885 --> 29:50.521
You got a shot here, wayne,
to redeem yourself.

29:50.523 --> 29:54.391
You're not gonna get
another one.

29:54.393 --> 29:57.828
I wish I could.

29:57.830 --> 30:00.030
I want to make amends.

30:00.032 --> 30:02.432
Believe me, I do.

30:02.434 --> 30:05.803
Then do what's right next time.

30:05.805 --> 30:09.039
Not just what's right for you.

30:19.350 --> 30:20.851
Lose the gun.

30:20.853 --> 30:22.986
(grunting)

30:22.988 --> 30:24.354
(groaning)

30:24.356 --> 30:26.523
(yelling)

30:26.525 --> 30:29.359
(grunting)

30:34.966 --> 30:37.534
(loud panting)
(grunting)

30:37.536 --> 30:41.271
(both yelling)

30:41.273 --> 30:44.441
You have no idea
what's coming tonight.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.176
(panting)

30:48.947 --> 30:51.448
Neither do you.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.473
(sighs)

31:18.910 --> 31:20.978
Feel better?

31:20.980 --> 31:22.579
No.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.982
But it's a start.

31:24.984 --> 31:27.317
You don't have
to do this alone.

31:29.921 --> 31:31.922
Come back to dc with me.

31:31.924 --> 31:35.025
The first thing
on my new list was,

31:35.027 --> 31:37.928
"I will let go of the badge."

31:37.930 --> 31:39.630
I'm not talking
about ncis.

31:39.632 --> 31:43.233
Listen, you can bag groceries,
for all I care.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.636
Just come home.

31:45.638 --> 31:48.438
Just...

31:48.440 --> 31:51.975
I just want you to come home...
With me.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.210
I don't think that's a ver--

31:53.212 --> 31:54.645
(quietly):
Hey, listen,

31:54.647 --> 31:57.047
(voice breaking):
I know it's hard...

31:59.450 --> 32:02.119
...And I know
you want to change.

32:05.490 --> 32:07.357
I can change with you.

32:31.049 --> 32:33.317
(whispering):
I'm fighting for you, ziva.

32:33.319 --> 32:36.053
(whispering):
I know.

32:39.090 --> 32:40.657
Robberies...

32:40.659 --> 32:41.725
(turning pages)

32:41.727 --> 32:43.493
Assaults...

32:43.495 --> 32:45.963
Hardly the international
conspiracy type.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.431
What conspiracy?

32:47.433 --> 32:50.500
I just got paid to get you
out of the picture, is all.

32:50.502 --> 32:53.537
Yeah, but it didn't
work, did it?

32:56.107 --> 32:58.008
Who paid you?

32:58.010 --> 33:02.646
I just get text messages,
and bags of money after.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.081
After what?

33:06.117 --> 33:07.751
What happens tonight?

33:07.753 --> 33:09.753
Your boy wayne
didn't tell you?

33:09.755 --> 33:12.656
Look, I'm not trying
to break your heart over here.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.758
And wayne didn't know
that he led me to you.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.294
But maybe you should've tried
to ask him these questions

33:17.296 --> 33:18.528
A little harder.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.263
(door opens)

33:20.265 --> 33:22.265
Mcgee:
Boss.

33:22.267 --> 33:24.101
You're not gonna believe this.

33:27.338 --> 33:31.141
This guy's got a bunch
of cryptic numbers on his phone.

33:31.143 --> 33:34.077
Orders to keep you away
from a predetermined target.

33:34.079 --> 33:37.514
All from dummy numbers
with the same 305 area code.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.516
What part won't I believe?
Okay.

33:39.518 --> 33:40.784
The part that I don't.

33:40.786 --> 33:43.020
I traced the blocked numbers
to a mainframe

33:43.022 --> 33:45.088
Owned by a series
of dummy corps.

33:45.090 --> 33:47.090
One buffer after another
till I hit an actual,

33:47.092 --> 33:49.092
Legitimate company
called gran castillo.

33:49.094 --> 33:50.193
It's a real estate company.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.529
(quietly):
Mendez.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.566
And get this--

33:56.568 --> 33:58.535
The short-range detonators
used in both bombings,

33:58.537 --> 34:00.303
Transmits using a phone signal.

34:00.305 --> 34:02.406
Mendez's phone.
Call he got at the hospital

34:02.408 --> 34:06.443
Could be the only reason he's
part of that anti-terror group

34:06.445 --> 34:08.812
Is to stop guys from walters
from trying to support it.

34:08.814 --> 34:10.547
Call fornell.
Pull a team together.

34:10.549 --> 34:14.051
Tell every agent to get to
the safe house; fbi, too.

34:14.053 --> 34:15.552
What about you?

34:23.828 --> 34:27.230
Where is it happening tonight?

34:27.232 --> 34:29.199
And what if I don't tell you?

34:39.177 --> 34:40.577
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

34:40.579 --> 34:44.181
(phone continues ringing)

34:46.150 --> 34:48.251
(recorded): You've reached
agent tobias fornell

34:48.253 --> 34:50.187
With the federal bureau
of invest...

34:50.189 --> 34:52.189
Let's go.

34:52.191 --> 34:53.790
Not a good time?

34:53.792 --> 34:55.225
I'll call them back.

34:55.227 --> 34:56.593
I'm a little preoccupied,

34:56.595 --> 34:58.595
Thinking about our last visit
to your friend walters.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.297
I wish I could forget.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.205
(scope clicking)

35:11.375 --> 35:14.177
Coldwell: Got walters'
security team in sight.

35:14.179 --> 35:16.546
Walters is more comfortable
with hospice care.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.849
Home is where I'd want
to spend <i>my</i> last days.

35:18.851 --> 35:20.450
Exactly how much
is he donating?

35:20.452 --> 35:23.120
He's signing over $2 billion
to fight terrorism.

35:30.761 --> 35:31.895
Targets are down.

35:31.897 --> 35:33.396
The place is all yours.

35:33.398 --> 35:35.232
<i>Plant the device and get out.</i>

35:44.208 --> 35:45.909
Coldwell.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.245
What are you
doing here, wayne?
We're all good.

35:48.247 --> 35:49.746
It's coming together
like clockwork.

35:49.748 --> 35:52.282
I can't go through
with it, not now.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.216
It's wrong.

35:53.218 --> 35:55.719
(both grunting)

36:02.193 --> 36:04.628
(struggle continues,
then body thuds)

36:14.605 --> 36:16.840
Wayne (weakly):
Gibbs...

36:16.842 --> 36:18.842
(weak gasp)

36:18.844 --> 36:20.911
Me... Mendez's phone.

36:20.913 --> 36:23.480
(labored breathing)

36:23.482 --> 36:26.650
(vehicles rumbling in distance)

36:26.652 --> 36:29.186
Do it, gibbs.

36:29.188 --> 36:30.687
Do it.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.223
(vehicles approaching)

37:07.792 --> 37:09.726
Check on walters' security team.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.262
I don't see
them up there.

37:14.999 --> 37:18.235
(phone ringing)

37:18.237 --> 37:20.704
Just let me get my phone.
We need to go
over the rules again?

37:20.706 --> 37:22.239
I know them by heart.

37:22.241 --> 37:24.441
(phone continues ringing)

37:27.245 --> 37:28.979
(gunshot echoes)

37:35.853 --> 37:38.822
(fornell groans)
man: Shots fired! Shots fired!

37:45.329 --> 37:47.964
Vance: Mendez lived completely
counter to everything

37:47.966 --> 37:50.634
He presented to the world,
gibbs, and all for profit.

37:50.636 --> 37:53.370
What the world saw
wasn't real.

37:53.372 --> 37:54.638
Just can't believe it.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.406
You shot me in the ass!

37:56.408 --> 37:58.341
It's a surface wound,
through and through.

37:58.343 --> 37:59.409
Through the ass.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.378
Painkillers.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.879
How'd I miss it, gibbs?

38:02.881 --> 38:06.483
Yeah, but I'm the one
got shot in the ass for it.

38:09.353 --> 38:11.321
This wasn't just mendez.

38:11.323 --> 38:13.857
No. Parsa's pulling the strings.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.825
And he's still
out there somewhere.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.294
Yeah.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.829
And not alone.

38:19.831 --> 38:22.899
(indistinct announcement
over p.A. System)

38:27.838 --> 38:32.409
There's still time
for you to change your mind.

38:36.781 --> 38:38.982
(sighs)

38:38.984 --> 38:41.518
What am I gonna tell people?

38:42.086 --> 38:44.554
That you were right.

38:44.556 --> 38:47.090
I have to start over.

38:47.092 --> 38:50.527
Okay, you and I both know that's
not gonna be enough for abby.

38:53.331 --> 38:57.100
Tell her that I am...

38:57.102 --> 38:58.735
Honoring gibbs.

38:59.737 --> 39:01.504
Gibbs?

39:02.473 --> 39:04.507
"stop this for him."

39:04.509 --> 39:06.910
Of course.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.111
Gibbs.

39:08.113 --> 39:11.514
I want to make him proud.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.450
He taught me
to follow my heart,

39:13.452 --> 39:15.552
And I know
that I have to...

39:17.588 --> 39:19.989
...I have to do this...

39:19.991 --> 39:21.524
Alone.

39:23.127 --> 39:25.962
I have to let go
of everything,

39:25.964 --> 39:27.130
Or I will be...

39:27.132 --> 39:29.999
Pulled back to where I started.

39:30.001 --> 39:33.436
Tell abby that for me.

39:33.438 --> 39:36.039
She'll understand.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.407
I will.

39:40.010 --> 39:42.379
So, what about gibbs?

39:42.381 --> 39:44.414
You gonna call him?

39:45.783 --> 39:47.016
I don't know.

39:47.018 --> 39:49.753
You gotta call the guy.
I don't know if I can.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.821
Oh, it'll be fine.

39:51.823 --> 39:54.891
You know how he is on the
phone-- functional mute.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.927
(laughs)
you'll hardly
know he's there.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.829
He's a good listener.

40:03.434 --> 40:04.901
Tony...

40:04.903 --> 40:07.570
You are so...

40:08.773 --> 40:11.074
Handsome? Funny?

40:11.076 --> 40:12.475
What?

40:13.611 --> 40:15.512
Loved.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.504
Okay.

40:43.774 --> 40:45.809
This is not easy.

40:53.217 --> 40:55.618
Hardest 180 of my life.

41:03.661 --> 41:05.595
(sighs)

41:10.868 --> 41:13.636
(laughs softly)

41:33.090 --> 41:35.158
♪

42:04.722 --> 42:06.089
