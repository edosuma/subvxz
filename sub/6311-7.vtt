when you were 16?

09:50.372 --> 09:51.721
No, 17.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.682
And a half.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.640
I had her when I was 16.

09:59.294 --> 10:00.948
All right.

10:01.035 --> 10:05.300
When I was 16, I was
at summer camp rowing a canoe.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.564
Great story, Ma.

10:08.651 --> 10:11.349
Thank you so much
for having us over.

10:11.436 --> 10:12.786
Our pleasure.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.396
And I brought
a nice bottle of wine.

10:14.483 --> 10:16.746
Oh. Thank you.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.356
You do know we
don'’t drink, right?

10:18.443 --> 10:20.010
Oh, yeah, I know.
It'’s for me.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.361
Open it now.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.458
Well, no one was
more surprised than I was

10:33.545 --> 10:35.983
when these two
got engaged.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.593
I mean, Gregory hasn'’t had
a girlfriend since...

10:37.680 --> 10:40.509
What was her name?
The one with the teeth.

10:40.596 --> 10:43.947
I don'’t know, Ma.
They all had teeth.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.993
Rachel. Rachel Levine.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.169
I liked her.
You ever hear from her?

10:48.256 --> 10:49.431
[chuckling]: No. I-I don'’t hear

10:49.518 --> 10:50.998
from any of my ex-girlfriends.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.173
[Phyllis chuckles]

10:52.260 --> 10:53.391
"Ex-girlfriends."

10:53.478 --> 10:54.958
Listen to Tom Jones over here.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.832
Don'’t you worry,
Violet.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.181
There was only the one.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.052
So,

11:02.139 --> 11:03.314
what is this I'’m eating?

11:03.401 --> 11:05.316
It'’s flanken.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.318
[laughs]
No, it'’s not.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.322
But it was sweet of you to try.

11:11.409 --> 11:14.021
Would you like some more wine,
Mrs. Munchnik?

11:14.108 --> 11:15.762
Oh, thank you.
And, please, Bonnie,

11:15.849 --> 11:18.329
we'’re only a few years apart--
call me Phyllis.

11:19.548 --> 11:22.290
[mouthing]

11:28.165 --> 11:29.689
So, do you miss the booze?

11:29.776 --> 11:30.820
Oy.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.039
What? I'’m curious.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.736
I'’ve never met an alcoholic.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.042
What about Uncle Artie?

11:35.129 --> 11:36.086
Zsz-zsz-zsz.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.611
My brother Arthur
was not an alcoholic.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.918
He just didn'’t know
when to stop drinking.

11:43.659 --> 11:44.704
Isn'’t that essentially...

11:44.791 --> 11:45.792
Zsz-zsz-zsz.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.750
[knocking on door]

11:49.447 --> 11:51.406
Excuse me.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.930
Look at that tiny tush.
I hate her.

11:54.017 --> 11:56.933
Hey. I gotta stay
here for a couple days.

11:57.020 --> 11:58.543
CHRISTY:
Um...

11:58.630 --> 12:00.502
yeah, we have guests.

12:00.589 --> 12:03.287
Sorry. I texted you, like, 1,000
times but you didn'’t answer.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.506
Who is this person?

12:04.593 --> 12:06.073
Hi, I'’m Jodi.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.075
Ah. You'’re Violet'’s friend?

12:08.162 --> 12:09.511
No, Christy'’s
my sponsor.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.382
I'’m lost.

12:11.469 --> 12:14.168
I'’m helping her
stay sober.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.433
Why do you need to crash here?

12:18.520 --> 12:19.782
'’Cause my
sister'’s a bitch.

12:21.479 --> 12:22.611
What happened?

12:22.698 --> 12:24.091
Mom, can you do this
another time?

12:24.178 --> 12:25.788
Hang on, Vi. What happened?

12:25.875 --> 12:28.269
I-I guess I borrowed her car
without telling her first,

12:28.356 --> 12:30.140
and she totally
freaked out on me.

12:30.227 --> 12:32.447
Oh, this is an easy one--
you'’re wrong.

12:32.534 --> 12:35.667
Go make amends to your sister
and get your ass to a meeting.

12:35.755 --> 12:36.930
But she was
really mean to me.

12:37.017 --> 12:37.887
Go!

12:38.845 --> 12:40.368
[sighs heavily]

12:42.152 --> 12:45.025
Believe it or not,
I am so proud of that girl.

12:48.158 --> 12:50.030
So, Christy,
I have to ask,

12:50.117 --> 12:53.337
what inspired you to go back
to school to become a lawyer?

12:53.424 --> 12:55.035
Well, actually, it was
something I'’ve wanted to do

12:55.122 --> 12:56.950
since I was a kid.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.516
I saw this one get hauled off

12:58.603 --> 12:59.953
by the police a bunch of times,

13:00.040 --> 13:01.476
and...

13:01.563 --> 13:03.086
I wanted to help her.

13:05.132 --> 13:07.743
You couldn'’t just say
you read a book about Lincoln?

13:09.876 --> 13:11.486
You know, that'’s
interesting.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.096
I got into psychology
to help mymother.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.796
As you can see, it didn'’t work.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.014
[laughter]

13:19.668 --> 13:20.887
Cute.

13:22.279 --> 13:23.541
I thought it was to understand

13:23.628 --> 13:25.108
your obsession with boobies.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.634
I had to breastfeed him
till he was four.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.636
Ma...

13:31.723 --> 13:33.290
Yeah, you want to zetz

13:33.377 --> 13:34.291
with the big boys,
that'’s what happens.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.775
So, we gonna talk
about the age difference

13:39.862 --> 13:41.124
with these two or what?

13:41.211 --> 13:43.126
Please let'’s go back to boobies.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.694
Christy, tell me

13:45.781 --> 13:47.522
that you'’re not concerned.

13:47.609 --> 13:50.003
Well, I-I was at first,

13:50.090 --> 13:51.656
but they both seem

13:51.743 --> 13:53.397
happy together,
and...

13:53.484 --> 13:55.530
isn'’t that what'’s important?

13:55.617 --> 13:58.315
Hmm. Thank you, Mary Poppins.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.842
How '’bout you?

14:02.929 --> 14:04.974
Well, Phyl...

14:07.498 --> 14:08.717
...who am I to judge?

14:08.804 --> 14:10.066
I'’m a middle-aged woman.

14:10.153 --> 14:12.286
What does that got to do
with anything?

14:12.373 --> 14:14.679
I just wanted you to know
I'’m a lot younger than you are.

14:17.073 --> 14:17.987
[knocking on door]

14:18.074 --> 14:19.336
Why don'’t I get that.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.773
Now, that'’s a zetz.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.910
What are you doing here?You wouldn'’t answer your phone,
you don'’t return my texts.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.346
I want to know what'’s going on.

14:29.433 --> 14:30.695
What'’s going on
is we'’ve got company.

14:30.782 --> 14:31.871
I'’ll talk to you tomorrow.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.611
No!
No?!

14:33.698 --> 14:34.786
I demand to be heard!

14:34.874 --> 14:36.179
I am not your secret sex toy!

14:38.921 --> 14:40.923
[quietly]:
Do something.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.883
Mom, you mind taking
your dumb-ass life outside?

14:43.970 --> 14:46.233
Sure. Move.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.062
Can you imagine what they
were like when they drank?

14:49.149 --> 14:50.977
[quietly]:
Mom, please...

14:51.064 --> 14:52.413
I'’m tired of letting
you call all the shots.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.284
Now, are we in a real
relationship or not?

14:54.371 --> 14:57.331
Wow. I'’ve never seen this
forceful side of you before.

14:57.418 --> 14:58.723
Well, sometimes a man'’s got--

14:58.810 --> 14:59.899
Well, I don'’t like it!Okay.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.251
Is Christy here? I need
to talk to Christy.

15:04.338 --> 15:05.295
Yeah. She'’s inside.
What'’s going on?

15:05.382 --> 15:06.644
My ex-husband is having a baby

15:06.731 --> 15:08.472
with his skanky
anesthesiologist,

15:08.559 --> 15:10.735
which is crazy, because he never
wanted to have a baby with me.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.520
[forced laugh]
I mean,

15:12.607 --> 15:15.827
why wouldn'’t anybody want
to have a baby with me?!

15:17.525 --> 15:20.397
So you can'’t even take a Xanax?

15:20.484 --> 15:22.443
No.

15:22.530 --> 15:25.707
We face our difficulties
with dignity and grace.

15:26.795 --> 15:29.319
Christy, I need you.

15:29.406 --> 15:31.060
My husband knocked up his whore.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.593
Everybody, this is Jill.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.594
Jill, this is...

15:43.681 --> 15:44.856
Don'’t care.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.249
Why don'’t you answer your phone?

15:46.336 --> 15:48.077
Let'’s talk in the kitchen.Mom,

15:48.164 --> 15:49.165
can'’t you do this later?

15:49.252 --> 15:50.601
Just need five minutes.

15:50.688 --> 15:53.430
JILL: I would'’ve been
a wonderful mother!

15:55.737 --> 15:58.087
Maybe six minutes.

15:58.174 --> 15:59.523
Maybe we should go.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.047
Are you kidding?

16:01.134 --> 16:02.657
This is like dinner and a show.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.398
STEVE: You'’ll regret this,
Bonnie Plunkett!

16:04.485 --> 16:05.877
You'’re gonna miss my lovin'’!

16:05.965 --> 16:08.097
Act two.

16:11.405 --> 16:12.319
Whew... [sighs]

16:12.406 --> 16:14.016
Sorry about that.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.539
Is everything okay?

16:15.626 --> 16:18.020
Not really.
I had to end it with him.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.631
All because he didn'’t want
to be your secret sex toy.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.373
Oh, for God'’s sakes.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.723
They say these things out loud.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.116
I shouldn'’t listen?

16:29.466 --> 16:31.077
It wasn'’t him.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.861
It'’s just hard for me
to make a commitment.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.776
Yeah? Why is that?

16:34.863 --> 16:36.256
Well, I don'’t know
if Violet told you,

16:36.343 --> 16:38.519
but the love of my life
died last year.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.086
Oh, I'’m sorry. No.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.913
How did he die?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.045
We were in bed together...

16:43.132 --> 16:44.133
Mom! Now!

16:45.700 --> 16:47.571
I'’m sorry. Two more minutes.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.921
Oh, forget it.
Let'’s just get out of here.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.706
Violet, please, I'’m trying.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.142
Yeah, you'’re always trying.

16:53.229 --> 16:54.361
I asked you for one normal
family dinner

16:54.448 --> 16:55.753
and you couldn'’t do it.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.190
Hey, friends come to me
for help.

16:57.277 --> 16:59.105
I am not gonna turn them away.

16:59.192 --> 17:01.107
Yeah, but I'’m--There'’s no buts.

17:01.194 --> 17:02.760
People were there for me
when I needed them.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.066
Now it'’s my turn.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.720
Great. And as always,

17:05.807 --> 17:07.200
it doesn'’t matter what I need.

17:07.287 --> 17:08.375
Let'’s go.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.203
Wait, may I
say something?

17:10.290 --> 17:11.508
Say it in the car.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.208
When I came here tonight,

17:15.295 --> 17:17.079
I didn'’t know what to expect.

17:17.165 --> 17:20.039
I mean, alcoholics,
drug addicts,

17:20.126 --> 17:22.911
felons, Gentiles...

17:25.782 --> 17:27.436
But, Christy,

17:27.523 --> 17:29.091
what-what you'’re doing
with the tattoo girl

17:29.178 --> 17:32.312
and that basket case
in the kitchen...

17:33.574 --> 17:35.228
...it'’s a mitzvah.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.969
A whatzvah?

17:38.057 --> 17:40.972
A mitzvah.
It means "a good deed."

17:41.060 --> 17:44.715
Huh. I thought
it was that big cracker.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.895
That'’s-That-That'’s matzoh.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.420
Say the other one again.

17:53.507 --> 17:54.769
Mitzvah.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.684
Violet...

17:56.771 --> 17:57.859
your mother helps people.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.165
What'’s better than that?

17:59.252 --> 18:00.949
I don'’t know. She could help me.

18:01.036 --> 18:02.951
Aw. What do you need help with?

18:03.038 --> 18:04.735
You'’re beautiful, you'’re young,

18:04.822 --> 18:07.738
you'’re intelligent,
you'’re gonna marry my son,

18:07.825 --> 18:10.741
have ten nice years with him.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.225
Ten?

18:16.312 --> 18:17.531
Yeah.
The over-under'’s six.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.274
The bottom line is
you should be very grateful

18:21.361 --> 18:23.624
that this wonderful woman
is your mother.

18:23.711 --> 18:26.627
Thank you, Phyllis.

18:26.714 --> 18:28.629
You'’re very welcome, dear.
[chuckles]

18:28.716 --> 18:32.241
This really is the most
adorable little tushy.

18:34.809 --> 18:37.116
What the hell am I eating?

18:38.726 --> 18:40.597
I'’ve been asking that
all night long.

18:48.866 --> 18:51.042
So, go figure--
ever since the dinner,

18:51.130 --> 18:54.220
we can'’t stop talking like
we'’re in Fiddler on the Roof!

18:54.307 --> 18:56.613
Enough already
with that verkakte story.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.138
You'’re breaking my kishkes.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.357
Oy.

19:01.444 --> 19:02.880
See? It'’s contagious.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.186
No, Steve just
walked in.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.582
With a shiksa.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.239
[sighs]
I'’m such a schmuck.
