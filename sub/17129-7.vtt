20:37.003 --> 20:40.840
ARE YOU SURE DOING THIS
IS THE RIGHT THING?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.208
[ CLEARS THROAT ]

20:42.208 --> 20:44.811
MA'AM, I'M JUST SHOWING YOU
TO YOUR ROOM.

20:44.811 --> 20:48.315
HOW YOU CHOOSE TO TIP ME
IS YOUR CHOICE.

20:48.315 --> 20:51.351
I'M TALKING ABOUT
CHANGING OUR WHOLE LIVES

20:51.351 --> 20:53.420
AND MOVING HERE
WITH THE KIDS.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.054
COME ON, ANGIE,
IF WE WERE IN LOS ANGELES,

20:55.054 --> 20:57.223
WE'D BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT
THE KIDS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW,

20:57.223 --> 20:59.359
BUT WE'RE IN PARADISE CANYON.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.693
WHAT COULD HAPPEN?

21:02.395 --> 21:03.863
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.733
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS AND...
WARM UP.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.704
BUT I'M NOT COLD ANYMORE.

21:13.239 --> 21:15.342
MAMI'S NOT COLD.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.343
AYE!

21:16.343 --> 21:17.910
GEORGE!

21:17.910 --> 21:19.679
STOP IT!
