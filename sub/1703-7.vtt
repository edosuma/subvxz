PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval
forces</i> <i>of the United States</i>

00:17.351 --> 00:19.958
PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: <i>This will not stand,</i>

00:19.992 --> 00:21.692

00:24.862 --> 00:26.030
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:26.064 --> 00:28.001
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.036 --> 00:30.506
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:30.540 --> 00:32.840
<i>The next song</i>
<i>we're going to play for you</i>

00:32.875 --> 00:34.009

favorites.

00:34.043 --> 00:36.646

00:44.426 --> 00:46.693
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:46.727 --> 00:50.395
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:50.430 --> 00:52.665

00:57.037 --> 00:59.505
SAUL:
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

God!

01:26.226 --> 01:27.003
You still haven't produced

01:27.116 --> 01:28.559
a single lead
connecting Sergeant Brody

01:28.594 --> 01:29.960
to any plot against America.

01:29.995 --> 01:31.495
You need to take down
that surveillance.

01:37.335 --> 01:39.236
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:39.270 --> 01:40.371
Hey, I know you.

01:40.405 --> 01:41.606
We're on to the next case.

01:41.640 --> 01:43.040
Find this man, Raqim Faisel.

01:43.075 --> 01:45.310
He followed me to this house.
No one knows

01:45.345 --> 01:48.113
we're living here.
I still think we should leave.

01:48.148 --> 01:49.281
Someone must have found out

01:49.316 --> 01:50.215
about the house.
How? I don't know.

01:50.250 --> 01:51.250
Where are we going?

01:51.284 --> 01:52.250
Someplace safe.

01:52.285 --> 01:54.018
We should turn ourselves in.
No!

01:58.757 --> 02:00.790
Three days ago you were
about to tell your kids.

02:00.825 --> 02:02.659
I mean, we were talking
about moving in together.

02:02.693 --> 02:04.594
He's my husband, Mike.

02:04.628 --> 02:06.428
You were my friend!

02:06.462 --> 02:09.097
(grunting)

02:09.131 --> 02:11.165
Hey, if you don't
slow down, I'm never

02:11.199 --> 02:13.768
gonna be able to catch up.

02:16.539 --> 02:18.773
(both moaning)

02:21.377 --> 02:23.979
MAN: Have you ever been
unfaithful to your wife? No.

02:25.148 --> 02:26.015
He's lying.

02:26.049 --> 02:27.683
He passed the polygraph.

02:28.985 --> 02:30.452
Get in.

02:30.487 --> 02:32.220

Help you?

02:51.538 --> 02:52.538
Ticket to Mexico.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.506
Lot of cities in Mexico.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.075
Tampico? Leon?

03:01.048 --> 03:03.951
The next bus to Mexico,
whatever that is.

Transfer in Nuevo Laredo...

03:19.869 --> 03:21.269
Sounds like a winner.

03:32.681 --> 03:35.483
So, why am I here?

03:35.517 --> 03:36.417
I don't know.

03:36.451 --> 03:38.453
You just got in my car.

03:40.256 --> 03:42.757
Well, I couldn't have gotten in
if you didn't stop for me.

03:42.792 --> 03:44.893
True.

03:46.095 --> 03:48.096
So, did I pass?

03:48.131 --> 03:50.999
The polygraph? Yeah.

03:51.033 --> 03:52.901
Flying colors.

03:54.537 --> 03:56.938
So you won't be hauling
me in again next week?

03:56.972 --> 03:58.639
Not that I know of.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.513
I'm taking some time...

04:06.547 --> 04:09.215
from home.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.083
From Jess.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.686
Is that right?

04:13.721 --> 04:16.423
She was fucking someone.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.923
I'm sorry.

04:22.396 --> 04:26.733
So what exactly are we doing?

04:26.768 --> 04:28.602
Well, I'd like a drink.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.636
Or three.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.606
All right, swanky
or hole-in-the-wall?

04:33.641 --> 04:35.474
I don't like the word
"hole" anymore.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.076
Right.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.545
But I do like a good dive.

04:43.983 --> 04:45.717
The more I drink,
the worse I play.

04:45.751 --> 04:48.053
That's not happening to you.
I know.

04:48.087 --> 04:51.255
Pissed off all my college
boyfriends, too.

04:51.289 --> 04:52.923
All of them?

04:52.958 --> 04:54.825
Both of them.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.294
Fuck me.

04:57.329 --> 04:58.462
Two out of three?

04:58.497 --> 04:59.964
Buy me another, you're on.

04:59.998 --> 05:00.931
Cuervo?

05:00.966 --> 05:02.833
Tequila Revolucion, silver,

05:02.867 --> 05:04.034
no lime.

05:04.069 --> 05:06.671
You like your clear liquors.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.487
What's up, chief?

05:22.522 --> 05:23.956
You want a ride?

05:23.990 --> 05:26.092
I got one.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.561
What, Opie over there?

05:29.330 --> 05:30.464
"88," huh?

05:30.498 --> 05:31.698
Yeah, it's my jersey number

05:31.733 --> 05:33.167
from high school.

05:33.201 --> 05:34.301
Or code for HH.

05:34.336 --> 05:35.836
Eighth letter of the alphabet.

05:35.871 --> 05:37.204
"Heil Hitler."

05:37.239 --> 05:39.806
You're not just a pretty face,
are you?

05:39.841 --> 05:41.775
You guys are White Nation, huh?

05:41.810 --> 05:43.143
That's cool.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.344
It's Aryan pride, baby.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.345
So what's the plan?

05:45.379 --> 05:47.614
Like, world domination?

05:47.648 --> 05:50.283
Yeah, that's right.
Any time soon?

05:50.317 --> 05:53.320
You wanna hear about it?
You can come outside.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.288
We got a van.
Hell, yeah.

05:55.323 --> 05:58.025
I love sucking Nazi dick.

05:58.059 --> 05:59.860
You know, I don't like people
fucking with me.

05:59.894 --> 06:01.362
Well, who does?

06:01.396 --> 06:03.564
Who <i>does</i> like people
fucking with them?

06:03.598 --> 06:05.165
Hey, is there a problem?

06:05.200 --> 06:06.734
Yeah, the problem is
this mouthy bitch.

06:06.768 --> 06:10.871
Hey, look, are we okay here?

06:12.340 --> 06:13.974
Huh?

06:14.008 --> 06:16.710
So is there, like,
a supremacist fist bump?

06:16.744 --> 06:19.012
What are you, a fucking moron?

06:19.047 --> 06:20.047
Bitch!

06:22.117 --> 06:23.250
Oh, God! Get those fuckers!

06:23.285 --> 06:24.585
Oh, shit!

06:24.619 --> 06:27.154
You fucking lunatic!
(Carrie laughs)

06:30.293 --> 06:32.027
I gotta unlock it.

06:33.296 --> 06:35.130
Open it! Okay, get in.
It's open.

06:37.901 --> 06:40.403
Fuck you, bitch!
Here they come. Go!

06:42.373 --> 06:44.608
(men yelling indistinctly)

06:45.810 --> 06:48.112
(laughs)

06:48.147 --> 06:50.781
You are a dangerous
fucking drunk.

06:50.816 --> 06:51.949
Thanks.

06:51.984 --> 06:53.685
It's not a compliment!

06:53.719 --> 06:55.620
My hand!
(laughing)

07:00.259 --> 07:02.460
Okay, okay, where now?

07:02.494 --> 07:05.930
I have a cabin...
or my family does.

07:05.964 --> 07:08.432
I've been meaning to get there.

07:08.466 --> 07:10.267
Sounds like the stars
have aligned.

07:10.301 --> 07:12.770
I-95. Hit it!

07:12.804 --> 07:14.338
(Brody laughing)

07:16.274 --> 07:17.973
Final touches, hon.

07:18.008 --> 07:21.043
All smooth. There.

07:21.077 --> 07:23.746
You're done.

07:23.780 --> 07:25.247
Dana, you're up.

07:31.754 --> 07:36.224
So, I'm thinking layers.

07:36.259 --> 07:39.227
Like, maybe really cut it
to my shoulders or something.

07:39.261 --> 07:40.261
Okay.

07:43.933 --> 07:45.834
Where's Dad?

07:45.868 --> 07:49.304
He's taking the weekend away.

07:49.339 --> 07:52.141
Why?

07:52.175 --> 07:54.110
Dana...

07:54.144 --> 07:55.679
He knows about you and Mike.

07:55.713 --> 07:56.914
Yeah.

07:56.948 --> 07:58.449
Jesus, Ma.

07:58.483 --> 08:01.152
Dana, I thought I was a widow.

08:01.187 --> 08:03.288
Our situation was very unusual.
Yeah, so you

08:03.322 --> 08:05.524
gave up on him and went whoring
out with his best friend.

08:05.558 --> 08:07.326
You cannot talk
to me like that!

08:07.360 --> 08:09.261
And now, Mom,
it's royally fucked up!

08:09.296 --> 08:10.996
Enough with the language
and the attitude!

08:11.031 --> 08:13.298
Or what?
Or you're grounded.

08:13.333 --> 08:15.201
Yeah, right.

08:15.235 --> 08:17.036
Starting right now!

08:17.070 --> 08:19.005
The whole weekend, you're home.

08:27.647 --> 08:29.782
I got a line on
our runaway terrorist.

08:29.816 --> 08:32.183
The one whose boyfriend
got iced in the motel?

08:33.586 --> 08:36.188
She stole a car outside
of Columbus last night.

08:36.222 --> 08:37.655
Just turned up
in Beaumont, Texas.

08:37.690 --> 08:39.457
Woman fitting
her description bought

08:39.491 --> 08:41.460
a one-way bus ticket, cash.

08:41.494 --> 08:43.395
Due to cross the border
late tonight.

08:43.429 --> 08:45.631
We believe Nazir's people
killed her boyfriend Faisel,

08:45.666 --> 08:48.501
and I think she'll
give them up.

08:48.535 --> 08:50.203
Texas agents can
intercept the bus.

08:50.237 --> 08:51.704
I want to go.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.140
You want to go to Mexico?

08:54.175 --> 08:55.475
Bring her back myself.

08:55.510 --> 08:58.044
One-on-one.
You can talk to her here.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.847
Put her in a room with a bunch
of suits, she'll go silent.

09:00.882 --> 09:03.850
David, I get this girl.

09:03.885 --> 09:05.485
I've spent the last three days
figuring her out.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.455
I can get her to talk.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.093
FBI's gotta escort you.

09:12.128 --> 09:14.596
Fine, as long as they keep
their fucking distance.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.867
David...

09:21.738 --> 09:23.605
trust me.

09:32.949 --> 09:34.550
Wow, I like it.

09:34.584 --> 09:36.218
Yeah, it's old school.

09:36.252 --> 09:37.253
No A.C.,

09:37.287 --> 09:39.555
build your own fire, like that.

09:40.891 --> 09:41.958
(grunts)

09:41.992 --> 09:44.761
Yeah, it's perfect.

09:46.997 --> 09:49.331
Where is the fucking key?

09:52.436 --> 09:54.236
(phone rings)

09:58.008 --> 09:59.442
Hello.

09:59.476 --> 10:01.211
Maggie, it's me.
Hi.

10:01.245 --> 10:02.645
Um, hey, just curious,

10:02.680 --> 10:06.249
which rock do we keep
the cabin key under?

10:06.283 --> 10:07.450
You're at the cabin?

10:07.485 --> 10:09.719
Uh, no, I'm home.

10:09.753 --> 10:12.788
Just wondering about the key.

10:12.823 --> 10:15.058
Carrie, what's going on?

10:15.092 --> 10:17.627
Uh, nothing. Nothing at all.

10:17.661 --> 10:21.464
You were supposed to come over
tonight and get your meds.

10:21.498 --> 10:23.566
Uh, Monday.
Gonna do that Monday.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.268
You don't have a pill
for tomorrow or Sunday.

10:26.302 --> 10:28.971
No, I have one left.
I'm fine.

10:29.005 --> 10:30.939
You sound drunk.

10:30.974 --> 10:34.342
(snorts) Drunk?

10:34.377 --> 10:36.278
(laughs)

10:36.312 --> 10:38.012
I am, actually, at the cabin

10:38.047 --> 10:38.980
With who?

10:39.014 --> 10:40.815
Uh, no, I'm all alone.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.083
I'm meditating.

10:43.118 --> 10:45.819
Okay, well, look,
take your pill tomorrow

10:45.853 --> 10:47.621
and then come over Sunday night.
No skipping.

10:47.655 --> 10:49.756
Okay, promise.

10:49.791 --> 10:51.591
Okay.

10:51.626 --> 10:53.526
Uh, so, the key?

10:53.561 --> 10:56.463
It's in the old stove.

10:56.497 --> 10:58.432
(gasps) Right! Stupid.
I remember.

10:58.466 --> 11:00.700
Okay, um, thanks.

11:00.735 --> 11:03.203
Hey, look, I'm at the open house
at the girls' school, but...

11:03.237 --> 11:05.171
Oh, great. Have fun.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.107
I'll drop everything and
leave if you're in trouble.

11:07.141 --> 11:09.009
Okay, I'll see you Sunday.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.645
Okay.

11:11.679 --> 11:12.880
Everything okay?

11:12.914 --> 11:14.348
Yeah. Wait.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.716
Wait here.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.192
(key jingles)

12:09.202 --> 12:11.537
(keys jangling)

12:20.079 --> 12:21.846
(sighs)

12:30.088 --> 12:32.356
What you looking at?

12:32.390 --> 12:34.125
A star.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.294
Wait an hour.
You'll see thousands.

12:36.329 --> 12:38.530
I just need one.

12:38.564 --> 12:41.566
I'd ask you what you
were wishing for, but...

12:41.601 --> 12:43.969
What?

12:44.003 --> 12:47.106
How would I know if you
were telling the truth?

12:47.140 --> 12:50.477
Oh, the polygraph.

12:50.511 --> 12:53.747
"Have you been faithful
to your wife, Sergeant Brody?"

12:53.781 --> 12:55.815
(chuckling)

12:55.849 --> 12:57.817
"Yes, I have."

12:57.852 --> 13:00.220
(both laugh)

13:00.254 --> 13:04.625
And hours before,
I was climbing all over you.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.326
Did you learn that over there?

13:06.361 --> 13:07.595
The climbing?

13:07.629 --> 13:09.396
No.

13:09.431 --> 13:12.599
How to beat the box.

13:12.633 --> 13:16.771
Well, I had to lie
sometimes to save my life.

13:16.805 --> 13:19.640
Maybe I became an expert.

13:22.978 --> 13:25.813
How'd you resist cooperating?

13:25.847 --> 13:28.916
I mean, you're in a hole.

13:28.950 --> 13:30.317
They're beating you.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.953
Carrie, I don't want
to talk about it.

13:34.488 --> 13:36.489
Sorry.

13:43.563 --> 13:45.563
(clears throat)

13:48.133 --> 13:51.636
You're a pretty good
drinking buddy.

13:51.670 --> 13:54.472
(laughing): I got a little
carried away with the Nazis.

13:54.506 --> 13:55.706
(chuckles)

13:55.741 --> 13:57.375
Well, I figure we're safe here.

13:57.410 --> 14:00.779
Yeah, unless my sister
sends in the dogs.

14:04.317 --> 14:06.518
I've been thinking about you.

14:06.553 --> 14:08.788
Yeah?

14:08.822 --> 14:11.023
And last night.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.792
Mmm.

14:12.826 --> 14:15.861
Parking lot sex.

14:15.895 --> 14:18.163
Classy.

14:19.899 --> 14:22.701
Can we graduate to cabin sex?

14:29.574 --> 14:31.675
Ow.

14:34.679 --> 14:36.246
BRODY:
Okay.

14:39.951 --> 14:42.353
(grunts, laughs)

15:00.372 --> 15:02.806
(Speaking spanish)
Last stop, Nuevo Laredo.

15:11.748 --> 15:13.716

Hi, Aileen.

15:36.609 --> 15:38.643
Who are you?

15:38.677 --> 15:40.746
Your ride.

15:40.780 --> 15:43.415
(Speaking Spanish)
How did you get out of the truck?

15:44.685 --> 15:47.286
Unless you prefer
the Federales.

15:49.623 --> 15:51.924
(Speaking Spanish)
Let's go, <i>gringuita</i>.

16:02.335 --> 16:03.768
Yes, we have company.

16:03.802 --> 16:06.470
In case you try to bolt,
the Feds are there.

16:06.504 --> 16:08.105
Of course, I told them

16:08.139 --> 16:10.807
you weren't dumb
enough to do that.

16:14.979 --> 16:18.516
So we're headed to
McLean, Virginia.

16:18.550 --> 16:20.819
Should take us 30 hours.

16:20.853 --> 16:24.089
I got what they call a
heavy foot, so maybe 25.

16:24.124 --> 16:26.292
And then I turn you over.

16:26.326 --> 16:28.027
To the FBI.

16:28.061 --> 16:31.931
Who, frankly, are
chomping on the bit

16:31.965 --> 16:34.499
to put you away, Aileen.

16:34.534 --> 16:37.302
See, they frown on terrorists.

16:37.336 --> 16:39.504
And, in particular, privileged

16:39.539 --> 16:42.173
wealthy American terrorists.

16:45.343 --> 16:48.578
I'm looking forward
to the drive, actually.

16:50.247 --> 16:53.616
I've had some upheaval at home.

16:53.650 --> 16:57.386
Could use some peace, quiet.

16:59.856 --> 17:04.126
You're obliging me with
that, so thank you.

17:07.195 --> 17:09.298
I'll just say this.

17:09.332 --> 17:13.034
We could talk things
out, you and I.

17:13.069 --> 17:16.237
Come to an understanding.

17:16.271 --> 17:18.539
But once we
get to D.C.,

17:18.573 --> 17:21.407
the Feds step in and I move on.

17:21.442 --> 17:23.042
And how you're treated

17:23.077 --> 17:25.712
and what you're
charged with--

17:25.746 --> 17:28.748
All that--

17:28.782 --> 17:31.584
It's quite out of my hands.

17:32.953 --> 17:36.223
So... food
for thought.

17:45.901 --> 17:48.370
(sighs)

17:48.404 --> 17:50.672

17:58.615 --> 18:00.349
Morning.

18:00.383 --> 18:01.917
(groans)

18:01.952 --> 18:04.487
Morning.

18:06.924 --> 18:09.926
God, it's so nice down here.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.293
Yeah.

18:11.328 --> 18:13.329
(sighs)

18:15.766 --> 18:17.267
I overdid it last night.

18:17.301 --> 18:18.535
Me, too.

18:18.569 --> 18:20.437
No more booze today. No.

18:20.472 --> 18:22.439
(grunts)

18:22.474 --> 18:24.575
(sighs)

18:28.581 --> 18:29.815
Look...

18:29.849 --> 18:32.051
I know.
This was crazy.

18:32.085 --> 18:33.919
I should call home.

18:33.954 --> 18:35.154
Yeah.

18:35.188 --> 18:36.922
I should go home, actually.

18:36.957 --> 18:38.157
Sure. Okay.

18:38.191 --> 18:39.425
We can head back.

18:48.135 --> 18:50.970
I love the water.
Mm.

18:52.873 --> 18:55.842
There's actually a really
beautiful waterfall out there.

18:55.876 --> 18:57.510
My sister and I
would hike to it

18:57.544 --> 18:58.845
every day in the summer,

18:58.879 --> 19:00.746
take our compasses
and notebooks,

19:00.781 --> 19:02.615
play Lewis and Clark.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.694
(sighs)

19:25.073 --> 19:27.140
SAUL: <i>Not only did your
cohorts</i> <i>turn on you</i>

19:27.175 --> 19:28.609
<i>and blow away your boyfriend...</i>

19:28.643 --> 19:31.077
Faisel was your
boyfriend, right?

19:32.380 --> 19:34.314
Not only that.

19:34.348 --> 19:36.616
Now they're after you.

19:36.650 --> 19:38.985
You're as safe as
you've been in two days

19:39.020 --> 19:41.554
riding with me.

19:50.031 --> 19:52.566
What was the plan, Aileen?

19:52.601 --> 19:56.537
Why'd you buy that house
under the flight path?

19:56.572 --> 19:58.973
Tell me that.

19:59.008 --> 20:02.811
And tell me who's out
there working on Plan B.

20:02.845 --> 20:04.179
Then I can help you.

20:04.214 --> 20:06.415
Bullshit.

20:06.449 --> 20:08.718
Huh.

20:08.752 --> 20:10.753
She speaks.

20:12.856 --> 20:15.090
(speaks Arabic)

20:17.227 --> 20:19.595
Must have learned
Arabic growing up.

20:19.629 --> 20:21.563
Riyadh, right?

20:22.732 --> 20:24.499
I know those compounds.

20:24.533 --> 20:26.501
Rich oilmen and their families,

20:26.535 --> 20:28.035
blocking out the world

20:28.070 --> 20:32.039
with those great walls,
living like desert kings.

20:32.074 --> 20:34.074
The pools, the gardens.

20:35.610 --> 20:38.914
Never mind the desperate
people outside the walls.

20:38.948 --> 20:41.884
The guest workers...

20:41.918 --> 20:44.553
limping along the road.

20:46.456 --> 20:49.758
Kids with no shoes, shirts.

20:49.793 --> 20:52.561
Kids like Faisel.

20:54.831 --> 20:57.066
You met there, right?

20:57.100 --> 20:59.569
As kids?

21:05.275 --> 21:08.911
He was 13; you were 15?

21:13.083 --> 21:16.086
Somehow, between
you being shuttled

21:16.120 --> 21:18.255
to that fancy American school

21:18.289 --> 21:23.127
and him laboring each
day for $1.10 a week,

21:23.161 --> 21:26.797
you and Faisel
found each other.

21:26.831 --> 21:29.433
He had a horse.

21:29.467 --> 21:32.136
We'd ride.

21:34.640 --> 21:36.574
Did you love him then,

21:36.608 --> 21:38.609
or did that come later?

21:44.116 --> 21:46.785
You don't know me.

21:54.292 --> 21:56.360
BRODY: So were you
Lewis or Clark?

21:56.395 --> 21:57.695
CARRIE:
Oh, had to be Lewis.

21:57.729 --> 21:59.129
Why?

21:59.163 --> 22:00.997
I like the name Meriwether.

22:01.032 --> 22:02.499
(laughs)

22:02.533 --> 22:05.535
So you were an adventurer
even as a kid?

22:05.569 --> 22:06.802
Yeah, I never really fantasized

22:06.837 --> 22:09.472
about New York or
a corner office.

22:09.506 --> 22:13.842
It was always, like,
Nepal or Uganda.

22:13.876 --> 22:16.011
How long were you in Baghdad?

22:16.045 --> 22:17.980
A couple
three-year stints.

22:18.014 --> 22:19.882
What happened out there?

22:19.916 --> 22:21.684
What didn't happen?

22:21.718 --> 22:24.520
What sent you
to that support group?

22:27.324 --> 22:29.291
I lost someone.

22:29.326 --> 22:31.327
My translator.

22:33.597 --> 22:35.865
Were you with him?

22:37.200 --> 22:39.835
Uh, he was protecting me.

22:39.870 --> 22:41.971
Trying.

22:43.607 --> 22:47.444
But this mob just got crazy.

22:49.447 --> 22:51.515
And they hung him from a bridge.

22:51.550 --> 22:52.983
I was...

22:53.018 --> 22:54.819
pinned down.

22:54.853 --> 22:56.154
I couldn't...

22:56.188 --> 22:58.156
Yeah.

23:07.434 --> 23:10.536
It's hard to find people
to talk to about it.

23:11.571 --> 23:13.539
How about your wife?

23:15.207 --> 23:17.875
It's like she doesn't know
who I actually am now.

23:17.910 --> 23:20.711
Well, maybe it just takes time.

23:22.047 --> 23:24.048
I...

23:24.082 --> 23:26.082
I can't be with her.

23:27.118 --> 23:28.618
No?

23:30.254 --> 23:32.221
No, I just...
(clears throat)

23:32.255 --> 23:34.624
I just can't.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.460
But I can with you.

23:38.495 --> 23:41.464
(chuckling):
Well, we were drinking heavily.

23:41.498 --> 23:43.465
No, but it's
different with you.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.634
It's, uh...
(clears throat)

23:45.668 --> 23:47.803
I don't know. It's free.

23:48.838 --> 23:50.873
As in, I don't charge?

23:50.907 --> 23:52.808
(laughs)

23:52.842 --> 23:56.445
As in, it's the first time
since I've been back

23:56.479 --> 24:01.817
that... well, I found
some fucking peace.

24:01.851 --> 24:05.321
Yeah.

24:05.355 --> 24:07.990
Me, too, actually.

24:11.361 --> 24:14.830
And that's pretty rare for me.

24:19.135 --> 24:20.536
So...

24:25.376 --> 24:27.277
Are we gonna try this sober?

24:32.317 --> 24:34.285
Uh, waterfall's just up here.

24:42.026 --> 24:43.627
MADDIE:
Concentration.

24:43.661 --> 24:45.295
Okay, so your word must begin

24:45.330 --> 24:47.198
with the last letter
of the word before it.

24:47.232 --> 24:48.633
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go.

24:48.667 --> 24:50.301
Okay.

24:50.336 --> 24:53.271
(chanting): Concentration,
concentration is the game.

24:53.305 --> 24:55.774
Keep the rhythm,
keep the rhythm just the same.

24:55.808 --> 24:56.875
Subject.

24:56.909 --> 24:58.109
Boys' names.

24:58.143 --> 24:59.444
Xander.

24:59.478 --> 25:00.445
Raphael.

25:00.480 --> 25:01.513
Liam.

25:01.547 --> 25:03.181
Mike.
(coughs)

25:04.216 --> 25:05.316
Drink!

25:05.351 --> 25:06.718
For the tenth time.

25:06.752 --> 25:08.552
You suck at this game.

25:08.587 --> 25:09.553
(chuckles)

25:11.556 --> 25:13.891
All right!
Come on, come on.

25:13.925 --> 25:15.493
(chanting): Concentration,
concentration is the game...

25:15.527 --> 25:17.294
All right, forget
this, forget this.

25:17.329 --> 25:19.663
Let's go out. Yeah?

25:19.697 --> 25:21.665
No, I'm grounded.
Your mom's working all day.

25:21.700 --> 25:22.700
She'll never know.

25:22.734 --> 25:23.701
No!

25:23.735 --> 25:25.569
Hey.
Whoa, whoa.

25:25.604 --> 25:27.004
Wild thing, slow down.

25:27.038 --> 25:28.472
JEFF:
Let's go to the quarry.

25:28.507 --> 25:29.507
Yeah.
Yes.

25:29.541 --> 25:30.507
No, guys, just let me...

25:30.542 --> 25:31.342
Get some more beer.

25:31.376 --> 25:33.677
(gasps)

25:33.711 --> 25:34.578
Oh, my God.

25:34.612 --> 25:35.846
You okay? Fuck.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.881
I didn't feel anything.

25:37.916 --> 25:39.750
Come here.

25:39.784 --> 25:41.685
One of you get a towel for her
right fucking now.

25:41.719 --> 25:44.221
MADDIE:
Oh, my God.

25:58.037 --> 26:00.004
30 miles to Memphis.

26:00.039 --> 26:01.706
You been to Graceland?

26:03.576 --> 26:05.443
No?

26:05.478 --> 26:07.345
You got to go
once in your life.

26:07.379 --> 26:10.548
See the Jungle Room.

26:10.583 --> 26:12.350
Stay at the Heartbreak Hotel.

26:16.221 --> 26:18.289
My dad thought Elvis
was the devil.

26:18.324 --> 26:21.325
Hoover thought he was
a national security threat.

26:23.395 --> 26:26.296
Like minds.

26:26.331 --> 26:28.966
SAUL: We've been
in touch with him.

26:30.502 --> 26:32.803
Your dad.

26:36.741 --> 26:38.208
I haven't.

26:38.242 --> 26:40.277
I know.

26:40.311 --> 26:42.312
Six long years.

26:47.919 --> 26:50.086
Thank you.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.087
Fries?

26:51.121 --> 26:53.723
No.

26:53.757 --> 26:55.425
He's worried about you.

26:58.029 --> 27:03.600
He's worried about
what their friends will think.

27:03.635 --> 27:05.802
That their good little
Princeton girl was shacked up

27:05.837 --> 27:08.839
with a poor brown Saudi,
and planning to give

27:08.873 --> 27:11.875
their beloved U.S.
the "fuck you" it deserves.

27:17.883 --> 27:20.184
Do you realize
how serious this is?

27:22.721 --> 27:25.690
You could end up
with the death penalty.

27:27.726 --> 27:30.462
What do you care?

27:30.496 --> 27:32.463
Why are you here, anyway?

27:32.498 --> 27:34.465
The FBI could've delivered me.

27:34.499 --> 27:37.469
That would have been
standard, right?

27:39.505 --> 27:41.707
I thought
we'd understand each other.

27:41.741 --> 27:43.375
Why?

27:46.680 --> 27:49.482
You were isolated growing up.

27:49.516 --> 27:51.084
Right?

27:53.153 --> 27:56.155
Well, there was
the compound community.

27:56.189 --> 27:58.123
If you like immoral businessmen.

27:58.158 --> 27:59.792
So you went outside the walls.

27:59.826 --> 28:01.660
Found Faisel.

28:05.431 --> 28:08.699
And then it was okay.

28:08.734 --> 28:11.836
There was something good there.

28:13.905 --> 28:16.807
But then my father
saw us one day.

28:16.842 --> 28:19.043
Riding that horse.

28:19.078 --> 28:22.079
His princess cavorting
with a local brown boy.

28:27.586 --> 28:29.253
Aileen?

28:29.288 --> 28:33.258
Is Faisel the reason you were
shipped off to boarding school?

28:38.264 --> 28:40.298
What do you know about it?

28:43.770 --> 28:45.737
More than nothing.

28:47.874 --> 28:49.908
I married a brown girl.

28:53.379 --> 28:55.847
You should eat.

28:55.881 --> 28:59.216
ETA: 12 hours.

29:02.454 --> 29:05.589
Think about
what you want, Aileen.

29:19.738 --> 29:21.405
(door closes)

29:21.440 --> 29:23.241
(keys jingling)

29:23.275 --> 29:25.210
Hey.

29:25.244 --> 29:26.244
I'm sorry.

29:26.279 --> 29:27.479
We were there forever.

29:27.513 --> 29:29.248
Is everything okay?

29:29.282 --> 29:30.783
19 stitches.

29:30.817 --> 29:32.218
Jesus.

29:32.252 --> 29:33.586
Good night, guys.

29:33.620 --> 29:34.887
Do you need help, hon?

29:34.921 --> 29:37.022
No.

29:41.627 --> 29:43.260
You okay?

29:43.295 --> 29:45.429
I don't know.

29:47.632 --> 29:48.632
(sighs)

29:48.667 --> 29:50.834
Everything's just so...

29:50.868 --> 29:51.902
Fucked up?

29:51.936 --> 29:53.002
Complicated.

29:53.037 --> 29:54.404
Yeah.

29:54.438 --> 29:57.107
Dana's like a surly stranger
in my house.

29:57.142 --> 29:58.742
I don't even know
where she went.

29:58.777 --> 30:01.412
How did she go from my adorable,
loving baby to that?

30:01.446 --> 30:03.948
Were you adorable and loving
when you were 16, Jess?

30:03.983 --> 30:06.084
You and Brody having it out.

30:06.118 --> 30:08.787
And now he's gone,
I have no idea where.

30:08.822 --> 30:10.923
Chris is still aces.

30:10.958 --> 30:12.892
(chuckles softly)

30:14.895 --> 30:17.630
I just want things
to be simple again.

30:17.664 --> 30:19.665
Hey.

30:27.473 --> 30:28.974
I miss you.

30:46.058 --> 30:47.692
CHRIS (in distance):
Mom?

30:47.726 --> 30:49.360
Coming, sweetie.

30:53.198 --> 30:54.665
Chris wants you.

30:54.700 --> 30:56.334
I heard.

30:56.368 --> 30:59.004
Thanks for watching him, and
thanks for fixing the door.

30:59.038 --> 31:00.038
No problem.

31:04.043 --> 31:05.611
Does it hurt?

31:06.679 --> 31:09.048
Yeah.

31:09.082 --> 31:11.350
How about... you?

31:11.384 --> 31:14.186
Yeah.

31:14.220 --> 31:17.723
I think we all need to give
peace a chance around here.

31:20.093 --> 31:22.495
You know what would
help with that?

31:22.529 --> 31:24.897
If you stayed away from us.

31:27.902 --> 31:31.105
There's no place for my dad
when you're here, Mike.

31:36.044 --> 31:38.445
(quiet jazz music playing)

32:09.143 --> 32:10.977
Hungry?

32:11.011 --> 32:12.378
Thirsty.

32:12.413 --> 32:13.112
Me, too.

32:16.617 --> 32:17.951
We're not doing that.

32:17.985 --> 32:20.954
No. No.

32:20.988 --> 32:22.622
(clears throat)

32:22.657 --> 32:24.257
Sorry.
(laughs)

32:24.291 --> 32:25.725
No, I am, I am.

32:25.759 --> 32:26.993
Jesus.

32:27.027 --> 32:28.928
I feel like
a terrified teenager.

32:28.963 --> 32:30.830
I know, I know.

32:33.867 --> 32:37.570
Well, shit, I'm just gonna,
I'm just gonna ask.

32:40.274 --> 32:41.808
Will you go to the prom with me?

32:43.811 --> 32:45.478
Do I get a corsage?

32:45.512 --> 32:47.280
Wrist or pin-on?

32:47.314 --> 32:49.982
Actually, I'll take a nosegay.

32:50.016 --> 32:51.617
I-I don't even know
what that is.

32:51.651 --> 32:53.919
It's a kind of bouquet

32:53.953 --> 32:55.287
from medieval times.

32:55.321 --> 32:57.356
Is that right?
Yeah.

32:57.391 --> 32:58.524
Pre-shower, pre-soap,

32:58.559 --> 32:59.993
they would carry them around

33:00.027 --> 33:02.162
to mask the unpleasant smells
of the time.

33:02.196 --> 33:04.498
To keep their,

33:04.532 --> 33:06.734
their "nose gay."

33:09.238 --> 33:10.672
I know these things.

33:10.707 --> 33:12.674
(both laugh)

33:20.483 --> 33:23.052
Are you still thirsty?

33:25.088 --> 33:27.657
Not at all.

34:07.767 --> 34:10.768
(thunder rumbles)

34:37.231 --> 34:39.232
(both panting)

34:56.516 --> 34:58.317
Do you want to stop?

34:58.351 --> 35:01.353
No, I want to just live here.

35:03.923 --> 35:05.958
For a second.

35:38.456 --> 35:41.659
(moaning)

35:54.173 --> 35:55.473
Issa?

35:57.009 --> 35:58.476
Issa?

36:02.248 --> 36:04.216
(gasps)

36:04.250 --> 36:05.984
Issa, where are you,
goddamn it?!

36:06.019 --> 36:07.986
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

36:08.020 --> 36:09.621
It's okay.

36:09.656 --> 36:13.224
(gasping)

36:13.259 --> 36:15.560
It's okay, you're with me.

36:15.594 --> 36:16.895
Issa, no!

36:16.929 --> 36:18.997
You're with me.
You're with me.

36:19.032 --> 36:20.666
You're with me.

36:22.602 --> 36:25.671
What happened?
You're safe.

36:25.705 --> 36:29.341
You're not there.
Everything's fine.

36:29.376 --> 36:31.477
Everything's fine.

37:01.544 --> 37:06.314
♪ ♪

37:35.609 --> 37:38.411
(sighs)

37:41.481 --> 37:45.418
Where are we?

37:45.452 --> 37:48.487
Calliope, Indiana.

37:48.522 --> 37:51.257
I grew up here.

37:51.291 --> 37:54.660
There were four
Jewish families.

37:54.695 --> 37:56.829
My dad was the local druggist.

37:56.863 --> 38:00.432
The nearest synagogue
was three hours away.

38:00.467 --> 38:02.067
So we'd come here.

38:02.102 --> 38:03.769
You're religious?

38:03.803 --> 38:06.004
My parents were.

38:06.038 --> 38:08.073
Commerce brought 'em here,

38:08.107 --> 38:10.741
even though the community
didn't want us.

38:10.776 --> 38:15.946
And they gave me strict orders
not to assimilate.

38:15.981 --> 38:18.683
You can't be on
the baseball team.

38:18.717 --> 38:21.085
They start the game
with a Christian prayer.

38:22.854 --> 38:24.888
You can't sing Christmas carols.

38:27.025 --> 38:29.494
When the other kids
stand to sing,

38:29.528 --> 38:32.630
you sit at your desk
with your hands folded.

38:35.234 --> 38:36.968
Respectful.

38:40.072 --> 38:42.107
But silent.

38:42.141 --> 38:46.679
Being a dutiful son, I did
precisely as they asked.

38:46.713 --> 38:48.381
Happily?

38:48.415 --> 38:52.852
What do you think?

38:52.886 --> 38:55.120
I was a kid.

38:55.155 --> 38:56.789
I just wanted to play ball,

38:56.823 --> 39:00.193
I wanted to be in the pageant.

39:00.227 --> 39:03.162
I'd gladly say their prayers,
sing the songs.

39:12.505 --> 39:14.740
I just wanted to not be alone.

39:14.774 --> 39:17.910
Man, I hated this place.

39:17.944 --> 39:20.179
It was the reason
I was different...

39:21.382 --> 39:23.784
strange...

39:26.755 --> 39:29.023
isolated.

39:31.527 --> 39:34.930
They fuck you up.

39:36.098 --> 39:38.100
Yeah.

39:45.241 --> 39:47.375
We got to get going.

39:47.409 --> 39:49.110
The agents await.

39:56.652 --> 40:00.422
I don't know what
happened to you, Aileen.

40:00.456 --> 40:03.792
I don't know how you went
from one more angry teenage girl

40:03.826 --> 40:06.695
to joining
the fucking jihadists.

40:06.729 --> 40:08.630
And if your issues are
truly geopolitical--

40:08.665 --> 40:11.233
Then I can't help you.

40:11.267 --> 40:13.602
I think you wound up here

40:13.636 --> 40:15.937
because you fell
in love with a boy.

40:18.407 --> 40:19.741
And he's gone now.

40:22.678 --> 40:25.747
Oh, that's a heartbreaker.

40:25.781 --> 40:27.749
I want to get you
through this as best I can.

40:40.962 --> 40:43.731
You okay?

40:43.765 --> 40:45.499
Yeah, I'm good.

41:05.719 --> 41:10.789
So, I know I have oatmeal--
Maybe frozen O.J.,

41:10.823 --> 41:13.858
but no Yorkshire Gold out
here in the sticks, sorry.

41:13.892 --> 41:15.827
BRODY:
What?

41:15.862 --> 41:17.695
Ugh-- Knowing my dad, we're
probably looking at Folgers.

41:17.730 --> 41:20.165
And I'm not kidding.

41:20.199 --> 41:23.302
How do you know the tea I drink?

41:27.074 --> 41:29.709
I don't know.

41:29.744 --> 41:31.745
You probably had it at Langley.

41:36.251 --> 41:37.284
I'm gonna go get some wood.

41:37.319 --> 41:38.485
I'll be right back.

41:55.901 --> 41:58.870
So what's the trouble at home?

41:58.905 --> 42:01.040
Nothing much.

42:01.074 --> 42:04.510
Just the love of my life
walking out my door.

42:07.014 --> 42:09.816
For good?

42:09.850 --> 42:11.885
I hope not.

42:14.022 --> 42:17.524
'Cause I can't imagine
being that lost.

42:24.700 --> 42:26.401
What happened to his body?

42:26.435 --> 42:29.571
Raqim?

42:29.605 --> 42:32.875
It's probably in
an Ohio morgue.

42:37.981 --> 42:40.449
He'd want a Muslim burial.

42:44.554 --> 42:48.191
Well, if no one claims him,

42:48.225 --> 42:51.261
he'll be buried
in a potter's field.

43:02.406 --> 43:03.806
(phone ringing)

43:03.840 --> 43:05.308
Estes.
David, it's me.

43:05.342 --> 43:07.142
We have a deal with Aileen.

43:07.177 --> 43:08.577
She talked?

43:08.612 --> 43:10.079
We need someone
up on the roof of that house

43:10.113 --> 43:11.480
under the flight path now.

43:11.515 --> 43:12.581
What did she tell you?

43:12.616 --> 43:14.150
She doesn't have the full story.

43:14.184 --> 43:16.051
They were just told
to buy the house,

43:16.086 --> 43:18.320
go about their business
till a visitor arrived.

43:18.355 --> 43:19.622
Which he did on Monday.

43:19.656 --> 43:21.090
She get a name?

43:21.124 --> 43:22.324
No.

43:22.359 --> 43:23.793
But he was American.

43:23.827 --> 43:26.128
She's sitting with
a sketch artist right now.

43:26.163 --> 43:27.429
Guy didn't say a word,

43:27.464 --> 43:28.797
went right to the roof.

43:28.832 --> 43:30.232
He spent over an hour up there.

43:30.266 --> 43:31.600
Doing what?

43:31.634 --> 43:32.968
That's what we got
to figure out.

43:33.002 --> 43:34.469
All right,

43:34.504 --> 43:36.438
we'll get Galvez up on the roof
right away.

43:49.618 --> 43:51.185
Hi.

43:53.522 --> 43:56.190
I didn't drink tea at Langley.

43:56.225 --> 43:58.459
What?

43:58.493 --> 44:00.662
Yorkshire Gold.

44:00.696 --> 44:04.032
That wasn't just a lucky guess.

44:04.066 --> 44:07.636
Well, why does that matter?

44:07.670 --> 44:09.805
Were you watching me?

44:09.839 --> 44:12.141
I don't know what you mean.

44:12.176 --> 44:13.676
I mean did you spy on me?

44:13.711 --> 44:15.912
You are a spy, right?

44:16.981 --> 44:19.149
Brody...

44:19.183 --> 44:21.117
That's why we ran
into each other

44:21.151 --> 44:23.519
at the support group, isn't it?

44:23.554 --> 44:25.120
Why you slipped me your number

44:25.155 --> 44:27.222
in case I ever
need to ask anything?

44:27.256 --> 44:28.623
No, you're wrong, Brody...

44:28.658 --> 44:31.860
Don't fucking lie
to me, Carrie!

44:33.095 --> 44:35.297
It was my job.

44:35.331 --> 44:37.232
It is my job.

44:37.266 --> 44:39.167
Oh, so you're still spying.
I'm working.

44:39.201 --> 44:43.238
I'm always working.
On what suspicion?

44:43.272 --> 44:45.840
Tell me, goddamn it!

44:45.875 --> 44:48.242
Shit.

44:48.277 --> 44:51.178
You looking for this?

45:04.460 --> 45:06.161
Abu Nazir's bomb maker told me

45:06.195 --> 45:08.830
an American prisoner
of war had been turned.

45:08.865 --> 45:14.269
And he was coming home,
to carry out an attack.

45:14.304 --> 45:15.738
And you believed this?

45:15.772 --> 45:18.240
He told me minutes
before he was executed.

45:18.274 --> 45:19.842
So?
So he was my prisoner.

45:19.876 --> 45:22.544
I interrogated him for months.

45:22.579 --> 45:24.246
He was cooperating at the end.

45:24.280 --> 45:26.882
There was no reason
for him to lie.

45:26.917 --> 45:29.217
You think I'm that P.O.W.?

45:30.720 --> 45:33.288
There's no one else
it could be.

45:33.322 --> 45:35.356
You're telling me
the fucking CIA

45:35.391 --> 45:37.592
thinks I'm working for al-Qaeda?

45:41.664 --> 45:44.933
I think you're working
of al-Qaeda.

45:53.342 --> 45:54.709
(scoffs)

45:55.811 --> 45:57.579
(exhales sharply)

45:57.613 --> 46:01.549
What about the gun, Carrie?

46:01.584 --> 46:03.686
Bears? Intruders?

46:05.622 --> 46:07.389
We just keep it in the cabin.

46:07.424 --> 46:10.626
Mm. Plus, you never know
when a terrorist

46:10.660 --> 46:12.261
might darken your door.

46:12.296 --> 46:14.930
I never said terrorist--
I said turned.

46:14.965 --> 46:16.899
If that were true,

46:16.933 --> 46:19.134
if any of this were true,

46:19.168 --> 46:21.436
wouldn't I just kill
you right now?

46:21.470 --> 46:23.605
Not if you're playing
the long game.

46:37.118 --> 46:38.952
(clearing throat)

46:40.154 --> 46:42.522
Ask me anything.

46:44.658 --> 46:46.359
What?

46:46.393 --> 46:48.427
There's the gun.
Hold it to my fucking head

46:48.461 --> 46:50.162
and ask me anything
you want to know.

46:50.196 --> 46:53.632
I'll show you how wrong you are.

47:14.089 --> 47:16.657
Afzal Hamid.

47:16.692 --> 47:18.726
What about him?

47:18.760 --> 47:20.694
Did you slip him a razor
blade at the safe house?

47:20.728 --> 47:23.129
How could I do that?
Answer the question.

47:23.164 --> 47:24.731
No. But I wish I had.

47:24.765 --> 47:27.199
And I hope he bled slowly,

47:27.234 --> 47:29.902
and died in a lot of pain.

47:31.271 --> 47:33.739
Who's Issa?

47:33.773 --> 47:36.475
Where did you hear that name?

47:36.510 --> 47:37.710
Who is he?

47:37.744 --> 47:41.348
He was my guard.
He was nice to me.

47:41.382 --> 47:45.686
What goes on in your garage?
My garage?

47:45.720 --> 47:47.188
You said ask anything.

47:48.557 --> 47:51.693
I take the trash bins
in and out.

47:51.727 --> 47:54.262
Fix a bicycle sometimes.

47:54.297 --> 47:55.830
Why do you go there
so late at night,

47:55.864 --> 47:56.931
so early in the morning?

47:59.568 --> 48:01.569
To pray.

48:04.606 --> 48:06.073
What is that?

48:06.107 --> 48:08.542
What? Nothing.
No, it's not nothing.

48:08.576 --> 48:09.776
It's a habit.

48:09.810 --> 48:11.744
When I don't have
my prayer beads.

48:14.748 --> 48:17.216
You're a Muslim?

48:17.251 --> 48:19.652
Yeah.

48:22.590 --> 48:24.725
You live in despair
for eight years,

48:24.759 --> 48:26.727
you might turn to religion, too.

48:26.762 --> 48:30.398
And the King James Bible
was not available.

48:38.974 --> 48:42.110
Why did they kill
Walker and not you?

48:42.144 --> 48:44.145
You asked me that in the debrief.
Yeah, and you were evasive.

48:44.179 --> 48:46.247
It doesn't matter.
I'll decide that.

48:46.282 --> 48:49.851
You don't need to know.
I need to know everything.

48:59.629 --> 49:02.298
I killed him.

49:05.835 --> 49:08.771
Okay?

49:08.805 --> 49:11.206
<i>I</i> killed him.

49:14.210 --> 49:17.613
They told me to
beat him to death

49:17.648 --> 49:20.015
or be killed myself.

49:21.651 --> 49:23.619
(sighs)

49:23.653 --> 49:26.022
And so I did it.

49:27.825 --> 49:31.428
And I vowed to never tell
another living soul.

49:41.240 --> 49:43.141
Who told you to kill him?

49:43.175 --> 49:44.710
Abu Nazir.

49:44.744 --> 49:46.945
So you did meet him.

49:46.980 --> 49:50.216
Yes.

49:50.250 --> 49:54.654
You lied to us about meeting
one of the leaders of al-Qaeda?

49:54.688 --> 49:56.856
That's right.
You want to explain that?

49:59.259 --> 50:01.560
I was embarrassed.

50:01.594 --> 50:03.762
Ashamed.
Why?

50:06.265 --> 50:08.666
Because he offered me comfort,

50:08.700 --> 50:11.068
and I took it.

50:17.709 --> 50:20.211
And became his follower?

50:20.245 --> 50:22.480
A soldier in his jihad?

50:22.514 --> 50:24.682
No.

50:24.717 --> 50:28.452
No. Jesus, don't you understand
anything I'm telling you?

50:29.888 --> 50:32.857
I'm not made of that stuff.

50:32.891 --> 50:36.261
I'm no hero.

50:36.295 --> 50:38.696
I had nothing to give.

50:38.731 --> 50:42.266
I was broken, living
in the dark, for years,

50:42.301 --> 50:45.903
and a man walked in...

50:48.908 --> 50:51.276
and he was kind to me.

50:51.310 --> 50:53.711
(breathing tightly)

50:57.316 --> 50:59.717
And I loved him.

51:16.835 --> 51:18.903
(cell phone ringing)
GALVEZ: Hello?

51:18.938 --> 51:20.272
SAUL (on phone):
Galvez, you up there?

51:20.306 --> 51:22.107
Affirmative.

51:22.142 --> 51:24.443
I've searched every square inch.
No weapons, no tools, nothing.

51:24.478 --> 51:26.246
Okay, so what's this guy
doing up there for an hour?

51:26.280 --> 51:27.781
GALVEZ: Well, it's pristine,
I'll tell you that.

51:27.815 --> 51:29.917
Would have expected some
bird shit and whatnot.

51:29.951 --> 51:31.485
SAUL:
He cleaned his workspace.

51:31.519 --> 51:32.720
GALVEZ:
I guess.

51:32.754 --> 51:34.555
Okay.

51:34.589 --> 51:35.956
Face the airport, Galvez.

51:35.991 --> 51:37.891
We're looking for direct

51:37.925 --> 51:40.460
line of sight targets.

51:40.495 --> 51:42.329
Now, what do you see?

51:42.363 --> 51:44.331
GALVEZ: There's a bunch
of airport hotels.

51:44.365 --> 51:47.968
Uh... a control tower
maybe half a mile out.

51:48.002 --> 51:50.404
And how about further?

51:50.438 --> 51:51.772
You got binoculars?

51:51.806 --> 51:54.174
Yeah.

51:55.977 --> 51:58.945
Okay, Terminal B
is about a mile away.

51:58.979 --> 52:02.148
Air France, hanger 30.
And what is that?

52:02.183 --> 52:04.150
It's small.
Has a helipad out front.

52:04.185 --> 52:05.218
Any signage?

52:06.554 --> 52:09.022
Uh... "Reserve M-1."

52:10.992 --> 52:12.626
Marine One.

52:12.660 --> 52:14.794
That's a landing pad
for Marine One.

52:14.829 --> 52:16.329
Oh, shit.

52:16.363 --> 52:18.931
A mile is well within
a sniper's range.

52:18.965 --> 52:20.266
An expert sniper.

52:20.300 --> 52:21.934
SAUL:
An American military sniper.

52:26.839 --> 52:28.373
David.

52:32.211 --> 52:34.212
Send me
Sergeant Brody's picture.

52:34.247 --> 52:36.181
Brody? Why?

52:36.216 --> 52:38.750
So Aileen can look at it.

52:46.860 --> 52:48.394
So we done here?

52:48.429 --> 52:51.665
Well, you have an
answer for everything.

52:51.699 --> 52:53.834
But you still don't believe me.

52:53.868 --> 52:56.402
I know an American
P.O.W. was turned.

52:56.437 --> 52:58.004
It has to be you.

52:58.038 --> 53:01.140
(sighs) (phone vibrating)

53:06.946 --> 53:08.713
I'm leaving.
No.

53:08.748 --> 53:10.582
We're not finished.
Yeah, we're finished.

53:10.616 --> 53:11.850
If you want to arrest me,

53:11.884 --> 53:13.051
you can come to my house.
No! Brody!

53:13.085 --> 53:18.689
Or maybe you want
to shoot me, now.

53:18.724 --> 53:20.425
(vibrating)

53:24.463 --> 53:27.065
Brody!

53:32.070 --> 53:33.438
Saul...

53:33.472 --> 53:35.406
We were wrong about Brody.

53:36.909 --> 53:38.376
What... what do you mean?

53:38.410 --> 53:40.044
SAUL:
<i>A P.O.W. was turned.</i>

53:40.079 --> 53:41.713
<i>But it wasn't him.</i>

53:41.747 --> 53:44.448
I, I... I don't understand.

53:44.483 --> 53:46.884
Aileen just I.D.'d Tom Walker.

53:46.919 --> 53:49.587
The other soldier
captured with Brody.

53:52.491 --> 53:54.458
Tom Walker died.

53:54.492 --> 53:56.460
No.

53:56.495 --> 53:57.895
He's alive.

53:57.930 --> 54:00.465
He's the terrorist.

54:00.499 --> 54:02.501
Shit.

54:03.102 --> 54:04.536
Brody!

54:04.571 --> 54:06.438
Wait!

54:06.472 --> 54:08.074
I, I was wrong.

54:08.108 --> 54:10.943
I made a terrible mistake.

54:10.978 --> 54:12.946
Don't you think I
don't already know that?

54:12.980 --> 54:16.483
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

54:16.517 --> 54:18.218
This weekend, this time

54:18.252 --> 54:21.321
that we spent together,
it was real.

54:21.355 --> 54:24.089
The parts that...

54:24.124 --> 54:26.792
that we both...

54:30.530 --> 54:32.097
The important parts.

54:32.131 --> 54:33.131
Hey, Carrie.

54:33.166 --> 54:35.167
Fuck you.
