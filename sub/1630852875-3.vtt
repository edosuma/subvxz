00:37.471 --> 00:39.204
He was saying
my father has done things.

"I'm a terrible person.

Your father is the best."
I agree.

00:42.676 --> 00:47.212
If he, like, really cared,
he would call us, mom a text.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.081

Bill's had an affair.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.483
And that's why he left
his old job.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.228
- Jennifer,
you've hurt endless people.

01:02.230 --> 01:05.097

01:05.099 --> 01:07.232

a rumor by Jackie,

01:07.234 --> 01:10.569

and blast Jennifer.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.503

To be fair,
I have a makeshift faucet.

It's disgusting.
The sink is only cold water.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.181
- Oh, Gabby, I feel so bad.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.448
- 'Cause Frank was like,
"You'll move home.

02:30.450 --> 02:31.717
You'll have a place to stay."

02:31.719 --> 02:33.985

for three weeks and there,

02:33.987 --> 02:35.520
I didn't see a single worker.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.189

02:37.191 --> 02:39.057
Frank still hasn't
finished the house.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.792
Dad screwed up a little bit.

02:40.794 --> 02:43.395
So I had the kids
move in with me

02:43.397 --> 02:48.266
till Frank gets on his game
and finishes what he has to do.

02:48.268 --> 02:52.404
I want you to have somewhere
to go without paying for bills.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.538
- Thank you, Mama.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.740

02:54.742 --> 02:56.942
'cause I know
you want your own house, okay?

02:56.944 --> 02:58.844
- We're very grateful.
Like, I'll be honest.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.545
I cannot wait till
this house is done.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.013
- There's just too much tension.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.816
And I was like, "Well, Frank,
how hard is it for you

03:03.818 --> 03:05.684

03:05.686 --> 03:08.286

03:19.166 --> 03:20.565
Welcome home.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.301
But since the renovations,

03:22.303 --> 03:23.969
he's been living
at the shore house

03:23.971 --> 03:26.371
<i>and he had plans to come back

03:26.373 --> 03:27.773

03:27.775 --> 03:29.441
- I don't know.
You'd have to ask him.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.376
And since it's been
Frank's home for a few years,

03:31.378 --> 03:33.245
<i>I don't feel it's right to say,</i>

03:33.247 --> 03:34.312

03:35.716 --> 03:37.717
- Do you think Frank moving in
is a good idea?

03:37.719 --> 03:40.052
- It's just kind of weird to,
like, have him live with you

03:40.054 --> 03:41.853
and we got divorced
22 years ago.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.322
- I think it's a ----ing
terrible idea.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.190
Me and Frank
are two strong personalities.

03:45.192 --> 03:46.658
We're going to butt heads.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.326
<i>- Frank and the kids

03:48.328 --> 03:51.062
I got divorced

04:32.106 --> 04:34.840

- Honestly, not only will I out
sex you, I'll outdrink you.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.421
The thing is,
I think he calculates into

09:49.423 --> 09:50.755
how many times he had sex

09:50.757 --> 09:52.491
when no one else
was in the room except himself.

09:52.493 --> 09:53.991
- [laughing]
- No, no.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.928
Then I'm having sex
six times a day.

09:55.930 --> 09:57.162
- Are you serious?
- I'm sick. I'm a sick (BLEEP).

09:57.164 --> 09:58.963
- Oh, I know you're sick.
[laughter]

09:58.965 --> 10:00.965
- Dolores ever caught
you whacking it?

10:00.967 --> 10:02.534
- Dolores is perfectly okay
with it.

10:02.536 --> 10:04.503
[stutters]
That's why when I tell you

10:04.505 --> 10:06.372
----ing Dolores was
the perfect wife,

10:06.374 --> 10:07.906
it goes to the point

10:07.908 --> 10:10.708
when women think that men cheat
because of a reason.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.511
We're an animal,
it just happens.

10:12.513 --> 10:14.780
Dolores is the perfect wife.
And I still (BLEEP) up.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.214
- I have to say something.
- Okay.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.049
- Other than Marge,
I'm gonna marry Dolores next.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.183
Marg keels over,
Dolores is mine.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.052
[laughter]

10:21.054 --> 10:23.322
- So you're
renovating her house, right?

10:23.324 --> 10:24.922
- And I'm almost done.

10:24.924 --> 10:26.524
- So what happens with Dolores?
She's living at this house?

10:26.526 --> 10:27.726
- She's living at the townhouse.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.227
And I gotta
to tell you something.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.964
This renovation has caused
some heavy conflict

10:31.966 --> 10:34.399
between me and my kids,
all right?

10:34.401 --> 10:36.067
'Cause again, my daughter,
I got her room done,

10:36.069 --> 10:38.436
I got the bathroom done,
she's still mad at me.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.737
So now, listen to me.

10:39.739 --> 10:40.972
I'm looking to move back
in Dolores's house.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.274
- Is it Dolores's house
or is it both of you?

10:43.276 --> 10:45.543
- In the divorce,
she got the house.

10:45.545 --> 10:48.813
I had to pay it off,
but she's at the townhouse.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.082
So now, Dolores sent out
a group text message.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.751
Family meeting.
Dinner.

10:52.753 --> 10:53.818
- You know
they're gonna kill you.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.286
What the (BLEEP)?
Why isn't the house done?

10:55.288 --> 10:56.555
- I can take anybody
hollering at me.

10:56.557 --> 10:58.423
I can take anybody insulting me.

10:58.425 --> 11:01.025
But when it comes to my kids,
I was like, whoa, chill out.

11:01.027 --> 11:02.160
- Right.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.294
- Little did I know
as you get older,

11:03.296 --> 11:04.762
that you got to answer
to your kids.

11:04.764 --> 11:07.366
- But listen, why isn't Dolores
moving in with David?

11:07.368 --> 11:09.300
- 'Cause I don't even know
if Dolores is even

11:09.302 --> 11:11.770
dating David anymore.
Dolores doesn't tell me.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.739
- David, what's his deal?
- He don't tell me either.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.106
All I know is
I haven't seen him around.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.908
I can guess
----ing trouble in paradise.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.309
- Really?
- Here we go.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.577
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you. Yeah.

11:19.579 --> 11:20.713
- Give me a lime,
give me a lime.

11:20.715 --> 11:23.047
- You want a lime?
You are such a bitch.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.049
You want a lime, too?
- Let's go.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.518
[laughter]

11:26.520 --> 11:27.519
- I love you, bitch.
I love you guys.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.153
- Oh, yeah, bitches.

11:29.155 --> 11:29.989
- You guys, listen, did you
hear what happened to Bill?

11:29.991 --> 11:31.255
- Yes, I heard.
- Oh, yeah.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.759
- I feel bad for him, man.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.394
- Oh.
- Bill's a good guy.

11:35.396 --> 11:37.128
I called Bill the other day
to make sure he was okay.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.529
- I called him, too.
- Right?

11:38.531 --> 11:39.664
- I said, "How are you doing?
Everything's good?"

11:39.666 --> 11:41.099
He said, "Eh, you know--"
- No, he's not.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.467
I don't think he's okay, bro.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.468
- Did you reach out to Bill?

11:43.470 --> 11:45.002
- No, because I think

11:45.004 --> 11:47.205
it's a little too close to home
with Marg and her fight.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.306
- I agree with you.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.541
- Like,
I think he's a great guy,

11:49.543 --> 11:52.276
but I think his wife went
over the ----ing edge.

11:52.278 --> 11:55.079
She carried on
about Marg was a slut,

11:55.081 --> 11:56.081
all this kind of sh--.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.682
Carrying on
about him being a crook.

11:57.684 --> 11:59.550
<i>- Which I take major offense
for that.</i>

11:59.552 --> 12:02.520
Hold on. So that night,
my sister comes up with Gia.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.689
I said, "Listen,
why'd you invite Jennifer?"

12:04.691 --> 12:06.891
Gia was mumbling
under her breath.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.794
What Gia?
What?

12:08.796 --> 12:11.763
If you want to say something,
go ahead. Talk.

12:11.765 --> 12:15.567
I've said one thing.
Gia got offended by that.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.368
- The other kids are okay?
- No.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.704
The girls, they all had
a little issue, yes.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.973
- It's family. Whatever
it takes to make it better,

12:21.975 --> 12:22.908
you do it.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.308
- Listen, I'm trying to do that,

12:24.310 --> 12:27.845
but you don't speak
to your uncle in that way.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.247
No matter what.
- Yeah.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.717
- And now Luis invited
everybody over to his house

12:31.719 --> 12:32.851
to make pizzas.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.118
- Okay.
- So whatever.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.853
How's Luis doing with your son?

12:35.855 --> 12:36.788
- Fabulous, bro.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.790
- Frankie's been working
for Luis.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.126
<i>- What's he doing for Luis?
- Real estate.</i>

12:41.128 --> 12:42.828
- Luis has been nothing
but awesome to my son.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.062
So here's to Luis.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.129
- To Luis.
- Here's to Luis. All right?

12:45.131 --> 12:46.464
And he's been awesome
to my sister.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.932
But listen, you know,

12:47.934 --> 12:49.467
there's a lot of stuff
about him on the internet.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.068
- Like running through
the woods naked with ten guys?

12:51.070 --> 12:52.271
- That was the video.

12:52.273 --> 12:54.639
- I know it was a video, man.
- Oh, my God.

12:54.641 --> 12:55.807
- Listen, how about this?

12:55.809 --> 12:56.941
How about we go on a retreat?

12:56.943 --> 12:58.342

like, before we had kids?

the night we met?

14:12.952 --> 14:15.419
It was a dirty bar.

22:42.729 --> 22:45.195

- Pasta, eggplant, and pizza.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.931

- Yeah, all good.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.366
What's up G?
- Hi. How are you?

22:49.368 --> 22:52.070
- Are we making pizza?
That's fun. How do you do that?

22:52.072 --> 22:53.871
- So you see like, when you put

22:53.873 --> 22:55.606
your hands like this,
you could flatten it.

22:55.608 --> 22:59.743

- I made like four pizzas.

22:59.745 --> 23:01.312
- So where's Audriana?

23:01.314 --> 23:04.215
- She had dance, but I'm going
to Boston for a week.

23:04.217 --> 23:05.550
She has nationals.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.417

this dance thing.

I'm gonna miss Jackie's party.

23:11.425 --> 23:13.290
I am so happy we don't hold
a grudge anymore with her.

23:13.292 --> 23:16.394
- Listen, we're good now,
but I just feel like everybody

23:16.396 --> 23:18.829
had Jackie's back
when I said something.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.631
But now that Margaret
says something,

23:20.633 --> 23:22.866
I feel like nobody's
having Jen's back.

23:22.868 --> 23:25.469
- She wanted to talk about
everybody else's marriage.

23:25.471 --> 23:26.503
- But now,
she's got to face something

23:26.505 --> 23:27.971
that she put under the rug.

23:27.973 --> 23:29.306
- Jennifer is a hypocrite.

23:29.308 --> 23:32.176
- Margaret crossed the line.
And--no.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.377
- I mean--

23:33.379 --> 23:34.979

how you don't see that.

comes after her own brother.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.255

the word crooks.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.389

23:45.391 --> 23:47.158

We forgot this one.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.228

23:51.230 --> 23:52.730

It just cooks so fast.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.331
- I know.
- Oh, what about the pasta?

23:54.333 --> 23:55.666
Oh, my God.
I'm to check on the pasta.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.001
- I took it out.
- Oh, you did. Thank you.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.335
- And I strained it.

23:58.337 --> 24:00.137

already burnt, bro.

24:00.139 --> 24:03.507

Oh. Spin it, spin it, spin it.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.418

us. This is so nice.

24:14.420 --> 24:16.286

- It's good.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.889

- Good dog.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.324

coming because I think

24:20.326 --> 24:22.293
sometimes it's really good
when families collide.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.094

to create repair.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.162

24:25.164 --> 24:26.430

[laughter]

24:26.432 --> 24:28.165

And then we keep going.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.434

once in a while.

24:30.436 --> 24:32.169
- I did something tonight and
we've done it in our family.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.170
I'm going to give everybody
two sheets of paper.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.571

24:34.573 --> 24:36.507

more into your life,

24:36.509 --> 24:37.975
you know, inside of this group.

24:37.977 --> 24:38.909
And then on the other sheet,

24:38.911 --> 24:40.244
one thing you want to let go of.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.646
- Do you share with everyone
what you're writing?

24:41.648 --> 24:43.380
- I mean, you could,
but you don't have to.

24:43.382 --> 24:45.582
- I don't.
[laughter]

24:45.584 --> 24:47.151
- We're not really deep people.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.652
- (BLEEP) it. Let's not write
it. Let's talk about it.

24:48.654 --> 24:49.786
- That's a good idea.
- That's it.

24:49.788 --> 24:51.089
- There you go.
- Bang.

24:51.091 --> 24:53.223
All right, so you start.
It's his game.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.725
- [chuckling] It's his game.

24:54.727 --> 24:57.595
- I want to lean into
more trust away from my fears.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.930
Traumatic experiences
have made me very guarded.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.199
I get tired of, like,
sitting in confusion,

25:02.201 --> 25:03.601

25:03.603 --> 25:06.204
Not like living life, failing
forward, leaning forward.

25:06.206 --> 25:09.674

talking--listen, I'm Italian.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.543
We talked like, "Oh, what--
What's your problem?"

25:12.545 --> 25:14.212
- Like when you don't have
the answers and you're sitting

25:14.214 --> 25:15.746
and, you know, creates pain.

25:15.748 --> 25:18.615

without saying sh--.

25:18.617 --> 25:20.817
Like, what the (BLEEP)
is really going on here?

25:20.819 --> 25:23.153
- So be less guarded
around this family.

25:23.155 --> 25:24.621
Teresa, why don't you go next?

25:24.623 --> 25:26.490
- Maybe loyalty.
'Cause I live by that.

25:26.492 --> 25:27.826

more loyal to people?

25:27.828 --> 25:30.427
- No, I am loyal.
- Oh, okay. Never mind.

25:30.429 --> 25:32.095
- I understand why you are
all about loyalty

25:32.097 --> 25:34.965
because many people
have broken your trust in life.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.134
- Yeah.
- I just want love.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.235
And then what's
the second thing?

25:38.237 --> 25:39.236
- What do you want to let go of?

25:39.238 --> 25:40.437
- Maybe judgment.

25:40.439 --> 25:42.172
- No, I don't have that.
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

25:42.174 --> 25:45.609

to admit faults. [laughs]

25:45.611 --> 25:47.177

25:47.179 --> 25:49.581

all night.

25:49.583 --> 25:52.115
- Now you're up.
[laughter]

25:52.117 --> 25:55.385
- I think what I would
lean more into

25:55.387 --> 25:57.387
is I don't think
we spend enough time together.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.656
- Yeah.
Well, that's why you should

25:58.658 --> 26:00.791
have been inviting me over
for Sunday dinner.

26:00.793 --> 26:03.260
- See, I'm doing positive talk
here. Not negative.

26:03.262 --> 26:04.194
- Yeah.
Good job, good job.

26:04.196 --> 26:05.330

26:05.332 --> 26:07.264
you just said
you should've invited me.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.999
No, don't expect
the phone call. Don't expect.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.267
- No, but it's a phone call--

26:10.269 --> 26:11.535
- 'Cause we all live crazy lives

26:11.537 --> 26:13.804
and family should not
hold any grudges.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.272

26:15.274 --> 26:16.941

26:24.750 --> 26:29.320

26:31.156 --> 26:36.226

- Milania, her end goal is just
for everyone to get along.

26:51.877 --> 26:53.877
- Like, obviously,
I'm hurt over what happened.

26:53.879 --> 26:57.781
But like, I dunno, just like
seeing someone scream at my mom

26:57.783 --> 26:59.449
and saying things about Dad.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.519
<i>- Just like the "Waking up

27:08.595 --> 27:10.194
at someone like that.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.462

27:12.464 --> 27:15.934
- And it's still going on,
which is really sad.

27:15.936 --> 27:19.469
- But, like, something
that I want to let go of

27:19.471 --> 27:21.806
is probably, like,

27:21.808 --> 27:26.477
the overthinking of, like,
what's going to happen next.

27:26.479 --> 27:27.712
- Like always expecting,

27:27.714 --> 27:29.080
like something's
going to blow up

27:29.082 --> 27:31.215
and she just wants it
to all be, like, good.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.083
- Like I just--
- That's fair.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.485
- And then what I want
to accomplish is--

27:34.487 --> 27:35.954
- What do you want to lean into?

27:35.956 --> 27:39.022

- Yeah.

I don't.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.452

been through so much

28:08.454 --> 28:10.521

28:19.799 --> 28:22.999

he holds it inside.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.706
- I heard there was drama

37:56.708 --> 37:58.042
the last time
they saw each other.

37:58.044 --> 37:59.108
[all chuckle]

37:59.110 --> 38:01.244
- Apparently, um...

38:01.246 --> 38:04.647
my skeletons from the closet
came out.

38:04.649 --> 38:06.383
- Oh.
That's unfair.

38:06.385 --> 38:07.684
- So listen.

38:07.686 --> 38:10.253
When you're comfortable,
we'll go talk to Margaret.

38:10.255 --> 38:11.854
- I kind of wanted
to avoid that.

38:11.856 --> 38:13.791
What she did was so hurtful.

38:13.793 --> 38:16.460
- Listen, Marg was harsh
and that's not okay.

38:16.462 --> 38:18.195
- I so appreciate that.

38:18.197 --> 38:19.462
- What are they saying?

38:19.464 --> 38:20.663
Like, they probably feel bad
for Jennifer.

38:20.665 --> 38:22.665
- I am sick of talking
about her.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.000
- I am, too.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.203
- Dolores, how's David?

38:26.205 --> 38:28.337
<i>[soft dramatic music]</i>

38:28.339 --> 38:30.474
- David and I aren't together.

38:30.476 --> 38:31.942
- Wait, has this been
or is this--

38:31.944 --> 38:33.277
- No, like yesterday.

38:33.279 --> 38:35.078
- Oh, I'm sorry. That sucks.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.748
The only person I told
about David was Frank.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.484
He's married to his job

38:40.486 --> 38:43.686
since he's smart enough
to know that he can change.

38:43.688 --> 38:46.622
And I'm smart enough to know
that I want a little more.

38:46.624 --> 38:48.825
It's not something
that is sustainable.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.459
- I don't care
what his ----ing problem is,

38:50.461 --> 38:52.363
'cause he's a great guy.
- Yeah.

38:52.365 --> 38:54.630
I know he's crazy about me,
he's crazy about my kids,

38:54.632 --> 38:56.899
but what else am I to you?
- Right.

38:56.901 --> 38:58.568
- But you want to know
what really got me?

38:58.570 --> 39:02.238
I knew someone
who was on life support.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.108
His family made the decision
to pull the plug

39:04.110 --> 39:07.310
and his girlfriend of 15 years
meant not a ----ing thing.

39:07.312 --> 39:09.379
So that's me.

39:09.381 --> 39:10.713
Yes, you bought me a house.

39:10.715 --> 39:13.183
Yes, you gave me a car
for my 50th, but guess what?

39:13.185 --> 39:15.652
What if tomorrow,
something happens

39:15.654 --> 39:18.455
<i>and there needs to be
a life-changing decision?</i>

39:18.457 --> 39:19.389
Who am I?

39:19.391 --> 39:20.658
I'm supposed to be your partner

39:20.660 --> 39:22.458
and things, but he didn't
bring me into his life.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.460
Like, I moved into that
townhouse by myself and I said,

39:24.462 --> 39:26.195
"Dave, please don't let it go
to this."

39:26.197 --> 39:27.998
I didn't have much
of a choice anymore. Like--

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
- Right. It was like he was
making her decision for her.

39:31.002 --> 39:33.536
<i>- I wanted more time from him.</i>

39:33.538 --> 39:38.407
I've been very lenient
and I was not demanding.

39:38.409 --> 39:40.244
- How is he taking it all?
Not well?

39:40.246 --> 39:41.678
- He was very shocked.

39:41.680 --> 39:46.684
So David got very used to it
and I got resentful.

39:46.686 --> 39:50.419
I'm very hurt.
- I know. I'm sorry.

39:50.421 --> 39:51.755
- So I don't want
to talk about it.

39:51.757 --> 39:55.291
We're out, we're drinking.
- We're at a keg party.

39:55.293 --> 39:57.293
- I want to do a shot! Evan!
- All right, shot.

39:57.295 --> 40:00.029
- I'm doing the first shot!
- Is Jackie smashed?

40:00.031 --> 40:01.697
- All right. Ladies first.
- Look at Jackie.

40:01.699 --> 40:03.232
She looks like
she's sucking a pee-pee

40:03.234 --> 40:04.901
and she doesn't even know how.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.503
- There. Yeah.
[all cheering]

40:07.505 --> 40:10.841
- That's the closest I've ever
seen you do a blow job.

40:10.843 --> 40:11.908
- [laughs]

40:11.910 --> 40:13.143
- All right!

40:13.145 --> 40:15.112
- Man, give me a hug, man.
What's up?

40:15.114 --> 40:16.712
- How you been?
Everything good?

40:16.714 --> 40:18.781
- I'm here, baby.
- We're with you, man.

40:18.783 --> 40:20.216
You know, we're boys, right?

40:20.218 --> 40:21.919
Wanna do a shot?
- Yeah.

40:21.921 --> 40:23.386
- You need it.
Let's go.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.054
[overlapping shouting]
Here we go.

40:25.056 --> 40:27.256
- Go, go, go!
[laughter]

40:27.258 --> 40:29.859
- It burns like an aftershave.
[laughter]

40:29.861 --> 40:31.127
- All right.
You want to play beer pong?

40:31.129 --> 40:32.662
- Yeah, let's do it.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.664
- Me and Evan.
- I'm with Tiki.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.399
- Yeah, you're with Tiki.
- All right. I'm going first.

40:36.401 --> 40:38.535
- All right, come on.
Here we go.

40:38.537 --> 40:39.669
- Oh!
- Drink it.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.137
- Somebody got to drink it.

40:41.139 --> 40:43.339
- Come on, what you got?

40:43.341 --> 40:44.541
- Let's go, baby!
- Oh, that's me.

40:44.543 --> 40:46.175
- Whoo!
- [grunts]

40:46.177 --> 40:49.212
- It's going down right now.
- Whoa!

40:49.214 --> 40:51.581
All: Oh!
- Yeah, yeah!

40:51.583 --> 40:54.017
- I didn't say hi to you yet.
- Hi.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.018
- You're doing good, though?

40:55.020 --> 40:56.487
- I mean, I'm very grateful

40:56.489 --> 40:58.821
that Traci's, like, looking
out for me and has my back.

40:58.823 --> 40:59.956
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.224
You know,
what Margaret did was rough.

41:01.226 --> 41:03.626
And I was upset that
that was said,

41:03.628 --> 41:06.162
and then she said, "Yeah, well,
she said this about me."

41:06.164 --> 41:07.396
- You know what, Margaret?

41:07.398 --> 41:09.166
You're used to
an environment of cheating.

41:09.168 --> 41:11.934
Your mother (BLEEP) someone
for 15 years.

41:11.936 --> 41:13.770
I'm not a mistress,
honey, that's you.

41:13.772 --> 41:15.172
- Okay, yeah.
- You are slutty.

41:15.174 --> 41:16.239
- So then I said, "Okay,

41:16.241 --> 41:17.708
I understand why you were
so mad."

41:17.710 --> 41:19.041
- [sighs]

41:19.043 --> 41:21.644
- That bothers me because
it's ----ing wrong.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.180
And I don't know if you're
better friends with Margaret

41:23.182 --> 41:24.581
than you are with me.

41:24.583 --> 41:27.184
- I'm close with both of you.

41:27.186 --> 41:29.652
- All right, I'm just gonna
be up front with you.

41:29.654 --> 41:30.987
- Yeah, yeah.

41:30.989 --> 41:33.724
- So Jackie has even said
that she's witnessed firsthand

41:33.726 --> 41:36.625
how you're not
a good friend to me.

41:36.627 --> 41:38.260
- I need to see you suck
that thing again.

41:38.262 --> 41:39.896
- Yeah.
Well, let me get another beer.

41:39.898 --> 41:41.664
- She's questioning
our friendship.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.199
That's not a nice person.

41:43.201 --> 41:44.467
- I don't want to throw Jackie
under the bus.

41:44.469 --> 41:46.802
- Hi, guys.
- But I--

41:46.804 --> 41:49.739
- Jackie, you're questioning
my friendship with Jennifer?

41:49.741 --> 41:52.609
- I'm saying then you are
Margaret's friend first.

41:52.611 --> 41:53.576
- I am both of their friends

41:53.578 --> 41:55.411
and that's not your place
to say.

41:55.413 --> 41:56.746
- It is my place

41:56.748 --> 41:57.814
because I'm looking out
for Jennifer right now.

41:57.816 --> 41:58.881
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.

41:58.883 --> 42:00.349
- By saying that
I'm not true to her?

42:00.351 --> 42:01.951
- No, by making sure that

42:01.953 --> 42:03.953
she's surrounded by people who
really have her back,

42:03.955 --> 42:06.356
and I don't feel like
that you've had her back.

42:06.358 --> 42:07.623
- You've been nasty to her

42:07.625 --> 42:09.226
since you walked
on this ----ing scene.

42:09.228 --> 42:10.893
You've made fun of her,
you've done things behind--

42:10.895 --> 42:12.895
- I made fun of her? She made
----ing videos about me!

42:12.897 --> 42:16.232
- Mrs. Merriam-Webster,
please define stalker.

42:16.234 --> 42:17.167
- Wow.

42:17.169 --> 42:18.268
And here I am comforting her.

42:18.270 --> 42:20.270
- Oh, that video.
Give me a ----ing break.

42:20.272 --> 42:21.638
- What's going on here?

42:21.640 --> 42:23.372
- The problem with you is that
you don't think that

42:23.374 --> 42:25.441
anybody has the right
to be upset about anything.

42:25.443 --> 42:26.643
- What's going on?
What's going on?

42:26.645 --> 42:27.710
- If there's a reason
to be upset.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.046
- I don't think
that she's been--

42:29.048 --> 42:31.381
- Listen. I said I'm both
you and Jennifer's friend.

42:31.383 --> 42:33.716
- You're my friend.
- You're a friend-friend.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.184
I'm both your friends, Margaret.

42:35.186 --> 42:37.253
I'm both your friends.
- You're much closer with me.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.389
- Just telling her
that you're on her side

42:39.391 --> 42:42.058
when you're not really
on her side does her no good.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.693
- Jennifer.
Do I support you or not?

42:43.695 --> 42:45.728
- Listen, I would love more.
- Fine.

42:45.730 --> 42:47.364
Then I'll work on that.
- I'd love more.

42:47.366 --> 42:49.131
- But I don't need
to hear from this.

42:49.133 --> 42:51.000
- What do you mean this?
Don't call me this.

42:51.002 --> 42:54.204
- You're this to me right now.
- Do not call me this.

42:54.206 --> 42:55.272
Don't ----ing call me this.

42:55.274 --> 42:56.440
- I don't need to hear
from this.

42:56.442 --> 42:58.141
- Don't ----ing call me this.
- This.

42:58.143 --> 43:00.444
- Excuse me, you're gonna
respect me more than that.

43:00.446 --> 43:01.611
- No,
I don't feel like doing that.

43:01.613 --> 43:02.678
- Don't ----ing call me this.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.248
- What are going to do about it?

43:04.250 --> 43:05.882
- Frank.
- What? What happened?

43:05.884 --> 43:07.584
We should go there.
[overlapping shouting]

43:07.586 --> 43:08.852
- What the (BLEEP) are going
to do about it?

43:08.854 --> 43:10.820
- Oh, it's getting heated.
Dolores, bro.

43:10.822 --> 43:11.887
- Stop, honey.

43:11.889 --> 43:12.955
- Don't ----ing talk in my face.

43:12.957 --> 43:14.056
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:14.058 --> 43:16.292
- Don't talk in my ----ing face.

43:16.294 --> 43:18.829
- What's going on here?
