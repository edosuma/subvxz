WEBVTT

00:12.430 --> 00:13.920
(DOOR OPENING)

00:37.872 --> 00:38.907
(GASPING)

00:40.958 --> 00:42.073
Who are you?

00:43.586 --> 00:45.622
What are you doing?
Get out of here!

00:45.755 --> 00:46.961
Mom!

00:47.965 --> 00:49.216
(GROWLS)

00:51.636 --> 00:53.172
LIDA: Lue? Lue?

00:53.638 --> 00:54.798
Are you okay?

00:55.014 --> 00:56.174
(GASPING)

00:57.642 --> 01:00.258
Okay, honey, calm down.

01:00.353 --> 01:02.639
It's all right.
You were just having
another bad dream.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.478
I can't breathe.
Yes, you can.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.648
You're fine. Just relax.
(GASPING)

01:08.152 --> 01:11.485
Just take slow,
deep breaths.
Nice and easy.

01:11.614 --> 01:13.275
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

01:13.366 --> 01:17.700
I'm trying, but I can't.

01:17.828 --> 01:18.908
Relax.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.736
Slow, deep breaths.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.867
I can't.

01:26.629 --> 01:27.664
Lue?

01:30.007 --> 01:31.747
Oh, my God. Lue?

01:31.842 --> 01:33.173
Lue, wake up!

01:33.302 --> 01:35.008
Wake up, Lue! Come on!

01:35.388 --> 01:36.673
Lue!

02:10.589 --> 02:12.375
FOREMAN: Been paging you
for over two hours.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.665
Must've been in the shower.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.045
And then I had
to moisturize.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.089
Eight-year-old boy
was brought into the ER

02:18.180 --> 02:20.592
last night with acute
respiratory distress.

02:20.725 --> 02:22.386
No history of...

02:25.771 --> 02:30.390
No history of asthma
or allergies and his
chest x-ray is clear.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.733
Actually, I had to
moisturize twice.

02:32.862 --> 02:35.820
Dominika made
Oysters Rockefeller
last night.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.191
Kid's been having
night terrors.

02:37.283 --> 02:39.774
Woke up in the middle
of one in full
respiratory arrest.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.037
Stress-induced
panic attack.

02:42.121 --> 02:44.282
Tell the parents
to lay off the grades.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.121
The world needs
fry cooks, too.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.241
He does great in school.
The parents are divorced,

02:48.377 --> 02:50.618
but it was amicable
and Dad's moved out
of state.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.337
You seen Wilson around?

02:53.424 --> 02:58.088
The dreams
are about an ugly old hag
trying to strangle him.

03:02.767 --> 03:03.927
The family's Hmong.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.597
SUNDS.

03:11.692 --> 03:15.401
Sudden unexpected
nocturnal death syndrome.

03:15.488 --> 03:21.028
AKA BS name for,
"No one's figured out
why they died."

03:21.702 --> 03:23.818
Over 100 in the early '80s,

03:23.954 --> 03:27.117
only male, only Hmong.

03:28.376 --> 03:32.870
Healthy right up
until the moment
they died in their sleep.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.041
What was he
dreaming about?
It doesn't matter.

03:35.633 --> 03:37.794
It's a dream.
It doesn't mean anything.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.001
If the nightmare's
scary enough,
meaningful or not,

03:40.137 --> 03:42.970
it could cause
a catecholamine surge and
ventricular fibrillation.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.048
An ancient demon,
called a dab,

03:45.142 --> 03:46.973
was sitting on him,
strangling him.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.267
Think that qualifies.

03:48.354 --> 03:49.810
Except in the
rational part of the file

03:49.897 --> 03:53.014
where it says his EKG's
within normal limits.
It's not his heart.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.811
What about
obstructive sleep apnoea?

03:54.902 --> 03:56.187
Sleep apnoea
wouldn't have caused

03:56.278 --> 03:57.939
breathing problems
after he woke up.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.566
What did you dream of?

04:00.241 --> 04:01.822
I never remember my dreams.

04:02.827 --> 04:04.533
But you're certain that
they're insignificant.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.030
Defensively so.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.494
l was defending science.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.287
You were defensively
defending science.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.081
Lung damage
from inhaled toxins

04:13.003 --> 04:14.994
Or an upper
respiratory infection.

04:16.257 --> 04:19.670
Okay. Chase and Park,
start lV antibiotics
for pneumonia.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.421
Taub and Adams,
go check the home
for toxins.

04:23.848 --> 04:25.679
It was my idea.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.598
Right.

04:27.685 --> 04:28.925
'Cause for
a moment there I thought

04:29.019 --> 04:30.179
you were uncomfortable
around Chase

04:30.271 --> 04:32.432
because you had
a nocturnal Australian.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.105
You can go with
whoever you want.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.402
But all of you,
read all of these files.

04:50.374 --> 04:53.036
Do you believe
a spirit could be
hurting your son?

04:53.127 --> 04:54.617
No, of course not.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.668
Because if he's been
taught to believe that,

04:56.755 --> 04:59.462
it is possible
for the fear alone
to affect heart function.

04:59.550 --> 05:03.418
I'm an engineer.
I know illnesses aren't
caused by evil spirits.

05:03.554 --> 05:07.388
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to,
| just had to check.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.932
Anything else
you need to check?

05:10.060 --> 05:11.391
No.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.816
I had a dream.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.907
House, we can talk later.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.777
Relax, I'm a doctor.

05:29.914 --> 05:32.326
Your spectacular breasts
mean nothing to me.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.915
House.House.

05:41.634 --> 05:42.714
Later.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.837
I had sex with Dominika.

05:45.596 --> 05:46.756
In a dream?

05:47.806 --> 05:50.639
It wasn't literally sex.
Technically, it was flossing,

05:50.768 --> 05:53.430
but you know,
teeth, testicles.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.261
I think the symbolism
is pretty clear.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.517
"Later" just changed
to "never".

06:04.240 --> 06:05.901
I'll tell you what
would be weirder.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.778
If you didn't dream
about having sex
with Chase.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.484
Have you?
No.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.328
But I've dreamed
about having sex

06:13.415 --> 06:14.791
with a lot of people
I work with

06:14.875 --> 06:16.035
and it didn't
freak me out.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.457
That's different.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.785
How?

06:18.879 --> 06:21.541
'Cause you've actually
had sex with a lot of people
at work

06:21.632 --> 06:23.918
and that hasn't
freaked you out.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.419
Good point.

06:25.511 --> 06:29.049
So you're worried
about what it means?

06:29.181 --> 06:31.843
I'm not worried.
It means nothing.

06:32.977 --> 06:34.808
It means something,
doesn't it?

06:36.438 --> 06:39.020
I work with him.
I can't want to
sleep with him.

06:39.108 --> 06:41.394
Maybe Chase just
represents work.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.771
You're just falling
in love with yourjob.

06:45.281 --> 06:47.442
It has been very
satisfying lately.

06:47.533 --> 06:48.818
You smell that?

06:50.202 --> 06:52.909
Yeah. (SNIFFS)
It smells like a wet dog.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.618
lt's mold.
It's not mold.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.950
It's definitely mold.

07:12.391 --> 07:15.383
I don't see any sign
of water damage.

07:26.405 --> 07:27.770
Holy crap.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.452
It looked like
a slaughterhouse.

07:39.543 --> 07:40.999
I don't know what
you're talking about.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.587
It was clean
when we left.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.754
You're telling us
some random person
broke into your house

07:45.841 --> 07:47.957
to dismember a pig
in your son's bedroom?

07:48.052 --> 07:49.258
A pig?

07:50.679 --> 07:51.919
My father-in-law.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.220
What did you do?

07:58.562 --> 08:01.474
What you should
have done weeks ago,
when the dreams started.

08:01.565 --> 08:02.771
I'm saving Lue.

08:03.484 --> 08:06.226
(MONITOR BEEPING)
REBECCA: He's coding!
Need a doctor in here!

08:08.906 --> 08:10.271
V-tach. No pulse.

08:10.366 --> 08:12.106
Oh, my God.
Push one milligram epi.

08:12.201 --> 08:13.441
Paddles. Charge to 50.
REBECCA: Charging.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.611
TAUB: Clear.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.403
(MONITOR BEEPING)

08:18.499 --> 08:19.488
(INDISTINCT)

08:19.667 --> 08:20.747
Still V-taCh.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.245
Charge to 100.

08:23.462 --> 08:24.542
100.

08:24.630 --> 08:25.665
TAUB: Clear.

08:26.924 --> 08:28.835
Charging...
Wait. Normal sinus rhythm.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.885
(COUGHING)

08:37.851 --> 08:39.933
He's stable,
but we've obviously
got a second symptom.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.433
Yeah, yeah, kid's in V-tach.
Tell me about
the luau in his bedroom.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.139
It's a traditional
Hmong ceremony.

08:45.234 --> 08:46.815
It's supposed to call
back the kid's soul.

08:46.902 --> 08:47.937
Hasn't he heard
of star 69?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.063
TAUB: There's more.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.065
The reason grandpa thinks
the kid's soul was stolen

08:51.156 --> 08:52.737
is because
he's convinced his son,

08:52.825 --> 08:54.656
the kid's father,
had his stolen as well.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.324
He beat his boss to death.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.539
The dad didn't move away,
he's in prison.

08:59.623 --> 09:02.285
PTSD could definitely cause
breathing problems and...

09:02.376 --> 09:04.412
It's not PTSD.

09:04.503 --> 09:05.913
Even if the kid
wasn't there,

09:06.004 --> 09:07.164
just hearing
what the dad did...

09:07.256 --> 09:08.336
But he hasn't.

09:08.424 --> 09:10.915
It happened when he was two,
and all he's ever been told

09:11.009 --> 09:14.092
is that his parents divorced
and his dad moved away.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.885
The heart thing indicates
a malignant arrhythmia.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.133
He needs an EP study.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.886
How many of the other files
showed malignant arrhythmias?

09:19.977 --> 09:21.933
None.
Then forget the EP.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.476
What about
acute pericarditis?

09:23.564 --> 09:24.599
Explains the dyspnoea.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.605
TAUB: lt's exacerbated
by lying supine,

09:27.693 --> 09:30.184
so the symptoms
would get worse
when he goes to sleep.

09:30.279 --> 09:31.940
Just like all 100
of the others.

09:33.866 --> 09:36.357
Do an echo to check
the pericardium.

09:36.452 --> 09:40.070
See if you can find
any cardio-active toxins
in the home samples.

09:41.749 --> 09:45.583
Can ljust say that
I very much enjoy my job?

09:54.678 --> 09:56.043
No, no, please.

09:56.138 --> 09:59.505
No need to apologize
for your earlier behavior.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.801
The floss was mint,
probably because of
this green G-string

10:03.896 --> 10:05.682
she hangs up to dry
in the bathroom.

10:05.773 --> 10:09.061
My watch must have stopped.
Apparently it's
already "never".

10:09.151 --> 10:11.107
You might want to
forward your calls.

10:11.195 --> 10:13.402
You do not want
the Reader’s Digest version
on this.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.814
There was a very tight
hygienist's uniform,

10:16.909 --> 10:18.865
suggestive use of
a water sprayer...

10:18.994 --> 10:21.485
The floss isn't sex.
lt's guilt.

10:21.580 --> 10:24.743
lt's tying you up
for throwing away
the INS notification

10:24.833 --> 10:27.415
granting Dominika
her citizenship.

10:27.503 --> 10:30.245
She can move out
but she still
doesn't know it,

10:30.339 --> 10:32.955
which means
you're basically
holding her prisoner.

10:33.509 --> 10:36.251
Tell her the truth
and leave me alone.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.856
Really?
What?

10:51.944 --> 10:53.605
You startled me.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.193
We work together every day,
usually under
a fair amount of stress.

10:59.284 --> 11:02.868
It's only natural l pop
into a subconscious thought
every once in a while.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.744
Have you ever dreamt
about having sex with me?

11:08.085 --> 11:09.416
No.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.663
You paused.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.917
No, I didn't.
You think I'm lying?

11:14.007 --> 11:16.840
No. I think you were
fighting the urge
to snap the word "no"

11:16.927 --> 11:19.919
because your subconscious
finds the idea abhorrent.

11:21.390 --> 11:22.926
(PAGERS BEEPING)

11:24.518 --> 11:26.509
Soiflsnap
it's offensive,

11:26.603 --> 11:29.140
and if I don't snap
it's offensive for
the exact same reason?

11:29.231 --> 11:31.313
Talk to your subconscious.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.607
This is becoming weird
because you're
making it weird.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.606
So you don't find
the idea abhorrent?

11:36.697 --> 11:38.528
I work with you.
I don't have to
answer that question.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.116
You just did.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.239
What happened?

11:47.165 --> 11:50.498
Echo was negative
but he has severe
abdominal pain.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.918
Ultrasound didn't suggest
any intestinal blockages,

11:53.005 --> 11:54.586
but he's severely
constipated.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.836
No spores, clostridium,
or organic toxins
in the kitchen samples.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.006
Nothing in the
bedroom either.

11:59.094 --> 12:01.801
We need to scope him
and we're gonna need to
clear his bowel first.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.504
We should biopsy
his thyroid.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.304
For an impacted bowel?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.257
Hashimoto's thyroiditis
would explain

12:07.352 --> 12:09.388
his lung, heart and
intestinal involvement.

12:10.147 --> 12:12.012
And if you think
we still need
House's approval,

12:12.107 --> 12:13.813
it also explains
dying in his sleep.

12:25.454 --> 12:28.491
When you invite me
for dinner, I thought maybe
you take me to a restaurant.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.197
Or have plates.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.499
Yeah. Sorry.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.622
Idiot delivery guy
forgot them.
Hmm.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.328
The idiot delivery guy,
or the idiot guy

12:36.423 --> 12:38.163
whose food you stole from
lounge refrigerator, huh?

12:39.843 --> 12:41.629
You've gotten
to know me pretty well.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.215
My citizenship
depends on it, right?

12:46.016 --> 12:47.222
Yeah.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.841
That's actually why
I wanted to talk to you.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.017
You heard news?

12:52.105 --> 12:53.515
Yeah.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.067
So, what news?

12:56.485 --> 12:58.567
They want us to come in
for another interview?

13:00.489 --> 13:01.854
No.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.993
Since we hadn't
heard anything, I called.

13:09.081 --> 13:12.790
And they said
it's gonna be
a couple weeks.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.959
Maybe a month
till they finalize
their decision.

13:18.090 --> 13:19.455
A month?

13:19.549 --> 13:21.676
Yeah, I know. It sucks.

13:22.928 --> 13:25.886
No, it does not suck
to live with you.

13:27.516 --> 13:31.384
It's been fun,
but, you know,
ljust want to be legal.

13:33.605 --> 13:36.267
And you will be. Absolutely.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.025
In the meantime...

13:41.113 --> 13:42.228
You ever shot anyone?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.280
No. Get away.

13:49.371 --> 13:52.408
Look, this needle
isn't nearly as big
as the one in your arm,

13:52.499 --> 13:53.909
and that didn't hurt,
did it?

13:54.001 --> 13:55.957
I don't want it.
They need to do it, Lue.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.160
You'll only feel
a little pinch

13:58.255 --> 13:59.495
as we give you
the numbing medicine.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.090
After that you
won't feel a thing.

14:02.092 --> 14:03.081
No!

14:03.176 --> 14:04.382
Lue, calm down,
it's gonna be okay.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.259
(SPEAKING HMONG)

14:09.141 --> 14:10.722
What's he saying?
What's the problem?

14:10.809 --> 14:11.924
I don't know.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.475
He's saying
it's too late.

14:13.562 --> 14:14.972
There's nothing we can do.

14:16.398 --> 14:17.478
lt's Hmong.

14:17.566 --> 14:20.103
He doesn't speak Hmong.
He's never even heard it.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.729
XANG:
It isn't him speaking.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.310
It's the dab.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.107
TAUB: He's seizing.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.608
Oh, my God!

14:26.700 --> 14:28.406
Need some lorazepam in here!

14:38.754 --> 14:40.369
Seizure rules out
Hashimoto's.

14:40.464 --> 14:41.544
Yeah, that's the issue.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.758
Not that we have
no rational explanation

14:43.842 --> 14:45.958
for how the patient
spoke a language
he's never even heard.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.213
I've got one.

14:47.304 --> 14:48.339
(SPEAKING HMONG)

14:49.890 --> 14:53.303
It means "you're a bunch
of pathetic idiots" in Hmong.

14:54.519 --> 14:55.895
Or it doesn't.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.971
But you wouldn't know
because none of you
speak Hmong.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.773
Kid, on the other hand,
is presumably fluent
in gibberish.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.397
The grandfather
speaks Hmong.
He translated.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.024
He heard what
he wanted to hear

15:06.114 --> 15:07.900
because if his grandson
really is possessed,

15:07.991 --> 15:09.356
that means his son
really is possessed,

15:09.451 --> 15:12.614
which is a giant
step up from being a
sledge-hammering psychopath.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.490
Whatever it was
preceded a seizure.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.946
It's obviously
a neurological symptom.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.748
Scleroderma,
advanced to the point that
it's affecting his brain?

15:20.754 --> 15:21.834
Interesting.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.002
So we should
start treating with...

15:23.090 --> 15:25.331
Interesting that you
keep falling for it
when I say, "Interesting."

15:26.218 --> 15:27.833
The scleroderma part
was idiotic.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.088
We'd have seen
skin involvement.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.511
The interesting part
is that you and Park agree

15:32.265 --> 15:34.221
but you're not able
to look at each other.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.305
Um... I'm looking at her.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.395
I'm looking at him.

15:40.482 --> 15:42.848
Good. Now lick your lips.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.901
Rasmussen's encephalitis.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.980
Diffuse spotty inflammation
could hit the autonomic
centers of the brain.

(HOUSE TYPING)

15:51.660 --> 15:54.026

15:54.788 --> 15:57.951
That's Hmong for
"get an MRI to confirm."

16:02.754 --> 16:05.837
Rasmussen's encephalitis?

16:05.924 --> 16:07.585
But he'll be okay?

16:07.676 --> 16:10.338
With treatment,
it's manageable.

16:10.428 --> 16:13.966
And it explains
all the things that
have happened to him?

16:14.766 --> 16:16.597
We think so...
You're wrong.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.596
And you're wasting
my grandson's time.

16:18.687 --> 16:21.770
Neurological issues
can cause a person
to speak in tongues,

16:21.857 --> 16:22.892
speak with an accent...

16:22.983 --> 16:24.564
He wasn't
speaking in tongues.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.188
In times of stress,
our senses can fool us
into believing...

16:27.279 --> 16:30.737
I know the difference
between science and faith.

16:30.824 --> 16:34.817
And when my son started
having the same dreams
my grandson is having,

16:34.911 --> 16:36.492
science couldn't help him.

16:36.580 --> 16:39.196
I'm sorry if your son
suffered from
mental illness, but...

16:39.291 --> 16:41.031
Kao was not crazy.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.794
He was bright,
caring, happy.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.921
Until the bad dreams came.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.624
I don't want to
watch it happen again.

16:54.306 --> 16:55.546
Please don't
scare the boy.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.090
It won't help him
get better.

17:11.031 --> 17:15.525
TAUB: Axial view of the
mid-brain level looks good.
Moving onto thalamic.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.243
I had another dream
last night.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.446
TMsﬂme
it was about you.

17:22.417 --> 17:23.873
Really?
See.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.461
That's how you're
supposed to react.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.126
When a woman tells you
she's dreamt about you,

17:27.214 --> 17:28.249
you should be thrilled,

17:28.632 --> 17:31.123
even if not interested
in her whatsoever.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.924
You're an idiot,
you know that?

17:33.011 --> 17:34.876
Well, I definitely
won't be dreaming
about you tonight.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.131
I'm jealous of you two.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.133
You couldn't be
more different and yet,

17:38.225 --> 17:40.056
you have this
good thing happening.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.725
You support each other,
you like each other.

Don't let House
screw it up.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.234
We're not that different.

17:48.318 --> 17:49.433
Yeah, you are.

18:10.966 --> 18:13.207
Well, apparently
there are some things
about you I don't know.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.629
I served one year
in police unit.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.336
And you're just telling
your husband now?

18:18.431 --> 18:19.932
Immigration doesn't know,

18:20.016 --> 18:21.472
no need
for husband to know.

(PAGER BEEPING)

18:24.771 --> 18:26.511
What is happening
to boy with demons?

18:26.606 --> 18:29.769
An absence of evidence
on an MRI,

18:29.859 --> 18:33.272
which my team has mistaken
for evidence of absence.

18:36.992 --> 18:39.654
This is what
I am not understanding.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.986
How can
you believe in dark matters
but not in dark spirits?

18:43.456 --> 18:47.995
Is the idea of demons
so different than
the Higgs boson?

18:48.086 --> 18:51.795
We can't see it,
but we can see the impact
of its presence.

18:53.508 --> 18:55.009
I borrowed
your physics book.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.335
I read while in bathroom.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.882

Better image. Thank you.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.532

my brain is sick.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.244
Your doctors are
trying their best

19:24.331 --> 19:26.413
but they aren't looking
in the right place.

19:27.208 --> 19:31.451
Yeah, I know
this is a lot to put
on an eight-year-old,

19:31.546 --> 19:33.457
but you've angered
our ancestors

19:33.548 --> 19:35.334
by ignoring them.

19:36.301 --> 19:38.758
Now, do you remember
how to talk to them?

19:40.388 --> 19:42.549
Yeah, that's right.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.222
Good. Now, close your eyes

19:45.935 --> 19:48.927
and we will ask
for forgiveness together.

The evil spirits
are in the air.

20:00.742 --> 20:02.528
And the only way
to stop them

is by stopping the air.

to hurt you.

20:25.642 --> 20:28.679

He was choking me!

20:51.334 --> 20:52.870
No, Lue, it wasn't real.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.451
It was.
He grabbed my neck!

20:59.092 --> 21:00.628
Those bruises
weren't there before.

21:08.601 --> 21:12.014
He had the dream,
then he had the bruising.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.686
HOUSE: More likely,

21:13.773 --> 21:17.391
and by "likely",
I mean rationally,
it was the other way around.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.271
His brain
felt the pain in his neck,

21:19.362 --> 21:21.478
created the dream
to explain it.

Lung problems cause
a clotting disturbance.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.200
He would have
bruises everywhere.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.152
Is it really preposterous

21:29.247 --> 21:31.363
that dreams can have
physical manifestations?

21:31.458 --> 21:33.369
The short answer is...

21:34.919 --> 21:38.207
Thoughts during sleep
can and do cause
physical changes.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.538
Is that right, Dr. Park?

21:39.632 --> 21:43.090
Did you wake up
this morning experiencing
physical changes?

21:44.554 --> 21:46.465
It's medically relevant.
Her dream
doesn't mean anything.

21:46.556 --> 21:49.047
Can we start acting
like it doesn't
mean anything?

21:49.142 --> 21:50.552
Sure. We could
also start acting

21:50.643 --> 21:52.053
like walls
don't mean anything.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.510
But then we'd hurt
our noses.

21:53.605 --> 21:54.890
You've been taking
the high road.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.723
You haven't been teasing
in an obviously
teasable situation

21:57.817 --> 21:59.273
because you know
it does mean something.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.189
She hates the dream
because it makes
her feel vulnerable.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.487
You love the dream
because it makes you
feel superior.

The poor lass
who can't help but fall
sway to your charms,

22:08.828 --> 22:11.535

upon her the gift of
illusory irrelevance.

Can you please
hint to House that
you had a sex dream?

22:15.585 --> 22:17.450

not to get distracted

22:17.545 --> 22:19.410
with trying to cure
the patient today.

I refuse to divulge
my dreams about
girl-on-girl loofa action.

22:23.218 --> 22:25.300
The bruising could
indicate anemia,

22:25.428 --> 22:28.511
a vitamin C deficiency,
or even leukemia.

22:29.098 --> 22:31.885
That is so weird
that you and I
had the same dream.

22:31.976 --> 22:35.309
I assume yours also ends
with me achieving ecstasy

placing third in the
New York City Marathon.

22:38.608 --> 22:39.848
Third?

22:39.943 --> 22:41.183
I'm a realist.

22:43.071 --> 22:44.982

22:48.952 --> 22:51.284
Hepatic fibrosis
could hit someone his age.

So let's hit his liver.
Get a biopsy.

Angle a bit more superiorly.

23:04.968 --> 23:09.382
He keeps having
these nightmares
that become real.

23:09.472 --> 23:11.713
They really hurt him.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.849
I don't want to believe
that a nightmare
can do that, but...

23:14.936 --> 23:19.771
I'm struggling with it, too.
But these things can
be explained medically.

23:20.984 --> 23:23.396
But you haven't.

23:23.486 --> 23:26.319
Every doctor,
every idea they've had,

23:27.282 --> 23:29.068
it's been wrong.

23:35.582 --> 23:38.449
Liver biopsy's back.
Team's about to meet.

23:39.294 --> 23:41.285
You're back to avoiding
eye contact with me?

23:42.797 --> 23:44.082
House got to you again?

23:44.591 --> 23:46.923
Want me to gaze
Iongingly into your eyes

23:47.010 --> 23:48.625
as I tell you
the test results?

23:50.013 --> 23:52.004
I want you to
treat me like a friend.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.256
Which means
getting over the fact

23:55.351 --> 23:56.887
that you like me
more than I like you.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.557
Yeah, egotism and preening
really turn me on.

24:00.898 --> 24:03.435
Too bad I'm not
attracted to androgyny

24:03.526 --> 24:05.391
and self-pity or
you'd have it made.

24:05.486 --> 24:09.399
Because anyone
who hasn't gotten wet from
your petri dish of STDs

24:09.490 --> 24:11.321
clearly has
low self-esteem.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.241
Bitch.

24:14.329 --> 24:15.569
Dick.

24:32.263 --> 24:33.548
CHI: Are you coming?

24:35.600 --> 24:37.136
Why didn't your lips move
when you said that?

24:37.226 --> 24:39.012
Chase, are you coming?

24:41.272 --> 24:42.432
The liver biopsy's back.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.393
I'll be right there.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.949
Biopsy was negative
for fibrosis.

24:56.037 --> 24:58.244
So once again
you don't know what's wrong.

24:58.331 --> 25:01.289
It's always good to
rule out the bad things.

25:01.376 --> 25:02.707
NURSE: Doctors.

25:08.508 --> 25:09.588
LIDA: God.

25:23.731 --> 25:24.971
Was he...

25:25.316 --> 25:26.977
Yes.

25:34.701 --> 25:35.736
He was levitating.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.408
Cool.

25:37.495 --> 25:41.113
So the one thing
we know for sure is,
he was not levitating.

25:41.207 --> 25:44.495
He was floating
six inches off the bed.

25:44.585 --> 25:46.667
He could've just
been arching his back
off the bed.

25:46.754 --> 25:49.962
Yes. But then Iwould
have come into
the room and reported

25:50.049 --> 25:53.416
that the patient was
weirdly arching his back
off the bed.

25:53.511 --> 25:56.799
It was his whole body.
He was levitating.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.971
So many questions.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.844
Starting with,

26:00.935 --> 26:02.391
why did Chase
address his comment

26:02.478 --> 26:03.888
to someone who wasn't
even in the room?

26:06.816 --> 26:11.731
Hocus pocus,
on my feet you
idiots must focus.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.109

26:20.413 --> 26:22.574

26:22.665 --> 26:23.905
The kid's not a magician.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.491
Of course not,
he's the lovely assistant.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.453
His Grandpa Pig Sticker's
waving the wand.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.287
Middling With,

26:32.049 --> 26:34.005
is Chase trying
to avoid Taub

26:34.093 --> 26:36.835
or is he trying to prove
that he's not avoiding Park?

26:36.929 --> 26:38.044
JESSICA: We checked the bed.

26:38.139 --> 26:41.222
There were
no platforms or wires.
This wasn't a trick.

26:41.309 --> 26:43.140
Tetanus can cause
muscle rigidity.

26:43.227 --> 26:45.309
Maybe he was propped up
by his heel and elbow.

26:45.396 --> 26:46.681
Except he wasn't.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.230
Tetanus wouldn't cause
that kind of
breathing difficulty.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.561
And ending with,

26:51.652 --> 26:53.358
if Chase is trying
not to avoid Park,

26:55.990 --> 26:57.491
But hypocalcaemia could,

26:58.284 --> 27:00.570
and the enema
we administered to cure
his constipation

27:00.703 --> 27:01.943
had a high phosphorus load,

27:02.038 --> 27:04.654
which could make him
transiently hypocalcaemic.

27:05.708 --> 27:07.073
It's a long shot.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.079
But at least
it has the benefit
of being rational.

27:09.420 --> 27:12.912
Go pump up his electrolytes
and start beta-blockers.

27:13.674 --> 27:15.926
And good news for Park.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.709
I think Chase had
a sex dream about you.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.472
Dreams don't mean anything.

27:25.186 --> 27:27.393
I don't know.
Nothing you've
done has helped.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.345
If we don't start
and he has another seizure,

27:29.440 --> 27:32.432
the neurological damage
could be permanent.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.063
My father-in-law...

27:35.530 --> 27:38.442
He thinks the calling
ceremony didn't work
because Lue wasn't there.

27:38.533 --> 27:39.898
And you think
he's right?

27:42.203 --> 27:43.318
I don't know.

27:43.871 --> 27:46.908
I'm sorry, but there's
no way we can allow him
to perform an exorcism

27:46.999 --> 27:48.705
in your
son's hospital room.

27:49.877 --> 27:52.289
Then lwill have
to take him home.

27:52.964 --> 27:56.172
A day ago you were insulted
I'd even think you
might believe that stuff.

27:56.259 --> 28:00.377
And now you're willing
to stop all treatment
so you can try it?

28:00.471 --> 28:02.848
Maybe Xang was
right about Kao.

28:03.891 --> 28:07.679
The man I loved
wasn't evil and would
never do what he did.

28:12.942 --> 28:15.308
He was possessed.

28:19.991 --> 28:22.482
And my son needs
his soul back.

28:24.161 --> 28:25.241
Why not?

28:25.329 --> 28:27.991
As long as he doesn't
feed the kid anything
or put anything on his skin

28:28.082 --> 28:30.243
that we haven't
verified as harmless,
what's the problem?

28:30.334 --> 28:31.585
I agree.

28:31.669 --> 28:33.409
And since
we're establishing
a new policy of,

28:33.504 --> 28:34.744
"What the hell,
we'll try anything,"

I'd like to hire
Shakira to belly-dance
while singing Waka Waka.

28:39.343 --> 28:41.595
As long as you get
the mom and Shakira
to consent.

28:42.013 --> 28:45.926
It's no different than
having a priest or rabbi
lead a prayer vigil.

28:46.017 --> 28:47.598
The mom is scared
and confused

28:47.685 --> 28:50.472

that'll give her hope.

28:51.188 --> 28:52.268
True.

28:52.356 --> 28:54.221
But in the long run,
I think you'll be happier

28:54.317 --> 28:56.148
having our lawyer
declare her unfit.

28:56.777 --> 28:59.063
That way, you won't be
ratifying superstition

28:59.155 --> 29:01.441

still be working here.

29:01.532 --> 29:03.614

make me happier?

and we're not ratifying
their beliefs.

29:07.538 --> 29:08.914
We're respecting them.

29:08.998 --> 29:12.081
You do realize
it may involve
animal sacrifice?

29:14.670 --> 29:19.289

in glass hospitals
shouldn't throw exorcisms.

But you have to understand
that we're a hospital,
not a temple.

Then I'll take him
elsewhere.

No, you won't.

He's sick. We can't
let him leave here.

have no choice.

29:54.418 --> 29:55.703

to your treatment,

41:12.095 --> 41:13.881
It means something.

41:14.890 --> 41:16.221
What?

41:16.892 --> 41:20.805
Well, it could
mean the obvious,
that you want some of this.

41:21.647 --> 41:24.980
When will you learn
that that look
is insulting?

41:30.947 --> 41:35.236
Or it could just mean
that we like each other.

41:35.786 --> 41:38.823
I'm weird,
and you're pretty,

41:38.914 --> 41:42.122
but we connect,
we feel safe.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.833
We trust each other.

41:47.506 --> 41:48.916
Maybe.

41:52.678 --> 41:54.009
(FARTING)

41:54.930 --> 41:56.921
Just testing my theory.

41:57.933 --> 41:58.922
(CHUCKLES)

42:07.192 --> 42:11.435
Adams defied me.
There's one more
zealot in the world.

42:13.448 --> 42:15.439
And Dominika moved out.

42:18.453 --> 42:20.944
She was fun. She was hot.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.371
She fixed my blender.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.790
That is not a metaphor.

42:25.919 --> 42:28.831
You know any good
fake divorce lawyers?

42:29.798 --> 42:32.665
I'm surprisingly
depressed by this.

42:38.014 --> 42:39.299
I have cancer.

42:44.187 --> 42:46.143
You were a little short
with me the other day.

42:46.273 --> 42:48.764
You do need an excuse.
Cancer may be
overplaying it.

42:49.484 --> 42:50.985
Stage II thymoma.

42:53.029 --> 42:55.486
I didn't want to tell you
until I had it confirmed.

42:57.451 --> 42:58.987
I got the tests back
this morning.

43:02.622 --> 43:04.487
I have cancer, House.

43:11.882 --> 43:13.588
