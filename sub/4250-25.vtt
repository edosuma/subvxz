- YEAH, WITH JEROME.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.425
- [laughs]

09:52.508 --> 09:53.843
JEROME.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.386
IS SHE JOKING?

09:55.469 --> 09:57.763
- A GIRL CAN'T WAIT AROUND
FOREVER, EDDIE.

09:57.847 --> 09:58.848
- YEAH, I--

09:58.931 --> 10:01.809
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS
WAITING AROUND.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.609
- I TRUST YOU ARE WELL, ROBERT?

10:10.693 --> 10:13.362
- WHAT A RIDICULOUS QUESTION,
VICTOR.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.363
YOU HAVE COME HERE

10:14.447 --> 10:16.282
WITHOUT A SINNER.

10:16.365 --> 10:17.616
HAVE YOU NOT?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.952
- YES, I'VE COME TO CHECK
CAROLINE'S TRAPS.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.372
- IT IS NOT THAT SORT OF VERMIN

10:23.456 --> 10:25.082
YOU SHOULD BE CONCENTRATING ON.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.210
VERY WELL.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.337
DO WHAT YOU NEED TO,

10:29.420 --> 10:31.589
AND THEN GET BACK
TO THE TASK AT HAND.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.552
- CHECK THE CAMERA FEED FIRST,
AND THEN...

10:36.635 --> 10:37.511
[sighs]

10:37.595 --> 10:38.554
GIRLS' BATHROOM.

10:38.637 --> 10:38.679
- UGH.

10:52.193 --> 10:52.902
- HE'S GONNA FIND THE CAMERA.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.862
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.830
- I BELIEVE YOU MAY HAVE

11:04.914 --> 11:07.708
A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN RATS,
CAROLINE.

11:07.792 --> 11:08.959
- NO, NO, NO,

11:09.043 --> 11:11.712
NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:11.796 --> 11:12.922
NO!

11:20.471 --> 11:23.057
- ANOTHER ONE
FOR THE COLLECTION.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.393
- WELL, HOW LONG HAVE THEY
BEEN THERE?

11:25.476 --> 11:27.603
HOW MUCH HAVE THE BRATS HEARD?

11:27.686 --> 11:28.604
WHAT HAVE THEY SEEN?

11:28.687 --> 11:30.439
- YOU SHOULD BE MORE VIGILANT.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.608
- OH, DON'T START BLAMING ME
FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF SOME

11:32.692 --> 11:33.442
OUTLAW DELINQUENTS.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.611
WHO IS WATCHING US?

11:35.694 --> 11:37.863
- EDISON MILLER.
WHO ELSE?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.281
- THEN IT IS TIME WE DEALT

11:39.365 --> 11:42.868
WITH EDISON MILLER...

11:42.952 --> 11:45.246
ON A MORE PERMANENT BASIS.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.333
- VICTOR'S NOT GONNA LET US
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.334
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

11:50.418 --> 11:51.460
- LOOK, IT'S NOT GREAT.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.420
BUT IT'S NOT SO BAD.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.797
THEY DON'T KNOW IT WAS US.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.674
IN THE MEANTIME,
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER

11:56.757 --> 11:58.384
WE FIGURE OUT THAT DRAWING.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.803
READY?

12:00.886 --> 12:01.721
- YEAH.

12:06.725 --> 12:07.184
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:07.268 --> 12:10.813
- LOOK, IT--

12:10.896 --> 12:12.398
COULD BE THE SAME.

12:12.481 --> 12:14.817
- YEAH, IF WE SQUINT...

12:14.900 --> 12:16.068
IN THE DARK WITH A BLINDFOLD.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.820
- [groans]

12:17.903 --> 12:19.822
- NAH.

12:19.905 --> 12:19.947
- [groans]

12:23.242 --> 12:24.827
- OH, IS THAT TUNA?

12:24.910 --> 12:25.327
I HATE TUNA.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.455
- [laughs]

12:27.538 --> 12:29.039
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU,
PATTY-CAKES.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.041
YOU'RE SO FEISTY.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.585
- WANT TO SEE FEISTY?

12:32.668 --> 12:34.044
TRY CALLING ME "PATTY-CAKES"
AGAIN.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.005
- [laughs]

12:36.088 --> 12:37.673
AND YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.175
LOOK AT THAT CUTE LITTLE SCOWL.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.677
IT'S LIKE A GRUMPY
LITTLE HAMSTER.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.012
[chuckles]

12:43.095 --> 12:45.514
- SO, UM, WHAT ELSE
HAVE YOU GOT APART FROM TUNA?

12:45.598 --> 12:46.891
- MY HEART.

12:46.974 --> 12:47.933
- OH, PLEASE.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.311
- PATRICIA,

12:50.394 --> 12:52.813
I KNEW FROM THE FIRST MOMENT
WE MET

12:52.897 --> 12:55.441
THAT YOU AND I
WERE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

12:55.524 --> 12:58.736
EVERY TIME YOU LOOK AT ME,

12:58.819 --> 13:00.863
I CAN SEE HOW...

13:00.946 --> 13:04.700
DESPERATE YOU ARE TO BE WITH ME

13:04.783 --> 13:07.745
THE WHOLE TIME I WAS WITH MARA
AND, INDEED, WILLOW.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.790
THAT MUST'VE BEEN AWFUL
FOR YOU.

13:11.874 --> 13:12.833
YOU'RE SO BRAVE.

13:12.917 --> 13:13.751
CUPCAKE?

13:13.834 --> 13:15.586
- DO NOT CALL ME...

13:18.005 --> 13:19.340
LOOK, JEROME,

13:19.423 --> 13:20.508
I'M--I'M REALLY SORRY,

13:20.591 --> 13:21.800
BUT I CAN'T DO THIS.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.261
IT'S JUST--
IT'S JUST TOO HORRIBLE.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.223
- FINALLY.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.682
- WHAT?

13:28.766 --> 13:29.308
- I WAS WONDERING WHEN
YOU WERE GONNA CRACK.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.769
IT'S FINE.

13:31.852 --> 13:32.853
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE
EDDIE JEALOUS, AND, WELL...

13:34.939 --> 13:36.357
I'M TRYING TO
PROVE A POINT TO MARA.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.194
I BET YOURS IS GONNA END
MORE HAPPILY THAN MINE.

13:41.320 --> 13:41.862
- WILLOW!

13:41.946 --> 13:42.905
H-HEY, WILLOW, UM,

13:42.988 --> 13:45.574
I-I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
WANTED TO, UH...

13:45.658 --> 13:46.700
MAYBE, UM, PERHAPS--

13:46.784 --> 13:49.245
- SO I WAS THINKING
WE SHOULD GO ON A DATE.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.746
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS
TRYING TO SAY.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.206
I MEAN, THERE'S THAT
PIZZA PLACE IN TOWN.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.542
IT'S REALLY ROMANTIC, CANDLES,
BREADSTICKS, THE WORKS.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.543
- MM.

13:55.626 --> 13:56.335
- OH.

13:56.418 --> 13:57.294
- OR WE COULD GRAB A BURGER

13:57.378 --> 13:59.046
AND GO SEE THAT
NEW HORROR MOVIE.

13:59.129 --> 13:59.421
- OH-HO-HO.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.257
YES!

14:01.340 --> 14:01.966
IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GOT
SPECIAL POWERS.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.637
- [muffled]
SEE?

14:08.430 --> 14:09.306
- OH.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.350
YOU SMELL THAT?

14:11.433 --> 14:13.727
- MMM.
OH, THAT DOES SMELL GOOD.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.104
WHAT IS IT?
- THERE'S A STEW.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.438
- [whispers]
OH, IT'S A STEW.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.275
- EDDIE, UH,

14:19.358 --> 14:20.609
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.570
- YACKER, THE BATHROOM TILE
LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THIS.

14:22.653 --> 14:23.529
- WHATEVER.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.072
LOOK, I WANT TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.451
- OKAY.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.953
- EDDIE?

14:31.036 --> 14:32.413
EDDIE, GIVE ME THE PICTURE.

14:38.419 --> 14:38.919
NOW, HERE WE GO...

14:44.341 --> 14:45.634
- HA!

14:45.718 --> 14:47.845
[whispers]
GENIUS.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.096
- THAT'S IT.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.151
- [sighs loudly]

15:02.234 --> 15:03.110
CRISP?

15:06.280 --> 15:07.156
- LOOK AT HIM.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.491
IT'S LIKE NEITHER OF US EXISTED.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.951
- I THINK YOU JUST NEED TO
TRY AND MOVE ON.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.373
- I TOLD HIM I LOVED HIM.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.001
- MARA, YOU DIDN'T.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.045
- AND HE WAS ALREADY
SEEING WILLOW.

15:22.796 --> 15:26.342
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.718
- HE DOESN'T CARE.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.556
- HE WILL DO,

15:32.640 --> 15:34.391
ONCE I TAKE HIS
LITTLE BLACK HEART,

15:34.475 --> 15:37.019
BRING IT TO LIFE, AND THEN
CRUSH IT TO A MILLION PIECES.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.856
- YOU MEAN YOU'D DO IT?

15:40.939 --> 15:42.650
- EH, WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?

15:47.988 --> 15:49.490
- SOMEONE MUST'VE GOT HERE
BEFORE US,

15:49.573 --> 15:50.699
MOVED IT, WHATEVER IT IS.

15:51.992 --> 15:52.868
- HANG ON, LOOK!

15:52.951 --> 15:53.869
LOOK AT THE TILE.

15:53.952 --> 15:56.622
[resonating ringing]

15:56.705 --> 15:58.374
- NINA'S LOCKET--
NINA'S LOCKET MUST OPEN IT.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.500
DO YOU HAVE IT?

15:59.583 --> 16:00.584
- YEAH.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.339
[ringing]

16:07.800 --> 16:09.051
HA!

16:09.134 --> 16:10.094
- THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT.

16:16.058 --> 16:16.558
[gasps]

16:16.642 --> 16:19.061
- WHAT IS IT?

16:19.144 --> 16:20.062
WHAT IS IT?

16:20.145 --> 16:20.437
- LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF...

16:20.521 --> 16:21.355
CAPSULE.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.273
- LOOK.

16:23.357 --> 16:23.816
WHAT ARE THESE?
SYMBOLS?

16:23.899 --> 16:25.567
- IT MOVES.

16:25.651 --> 16:26.860
MUST BE SOME KIND OF
COMBINATION LOCK.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.737
- GUYS, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.030
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.281
- [chuckles]

16:31.365 --> 16:31.782
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

16:31.865 --> 16:33.450
- YACKER,

16:33.534 --> 16:35.327
WHAT'D YOU WANT TO TELL ME
EARLIER?

16:35.411 --> 16:37.913
- UM...

16:37.996 --> 16:40.207
MEET ME IN THE LIVING ROOM
AT 8:00.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.667
WE'LL TALK THEN.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.044
- OR JUST TELL ME NOW.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.255
OR 8:00 IN
THE LIVING ROOM'S GOOD.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.258
- HEY.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.679
[music swells]

17:07.276 --> 17:07.901
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:07.984 --> 17:10.319
- SITTING NEXT TO YOU.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.449
CAN'T ONE FRIEND
SIT NEXT TO ANOTHER FRIEND?

17:13.531 --> 17:15.492
- I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE FRIENDS.

17:15.576 --> 17:16.743
- WELL, NOW YOU DO.

17:16.827 --> 17:19.371
SEE, YOU LEARN
SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY.

17:19.454 --> 17:20.289
- APPARENTLY.

17:26.336 --> 17:28.255
- DID YOU SOLVE
PATRICIA'S LOVE ISSUES?

17:30.507 --> 17:31.967
- APPARENTLY.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.058
- YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT THAT,

17:40.142 --> 17:42.060
GOOD AT SEEING WHAT MAKES
PEOPLE TICK.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.063
- APPARENTLY.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.110
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT MAKES ME TICK?

17:52.905 --> 17:56.074
- SORRY, WHAT DID I MISS?

17:56.158 --> 17:56.241
- NOTHING.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.334
- I DON'T SEE WHY ROBERT
COULDN'T LET ME

18:05.417 --> 18:06.668
DEAL WITH MILLER ON MY OWN.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.463
- I ASSURE YOU,
THE FEELING IS ENTIRELY MUTUAL.

18:09.546 --> 18:12.382
HOWEVER, WE MUST FOLLOW
ROBERT'S INSTRUCTIONS.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.761
JUST BE THERE AT THE AGREED TIME

18:15.844 --> 18:16.970
AND PLAY YOUR PART.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.848
- I HOPE THIS PLAN OF YOURS
WORKS.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.601
- IF YOU FOLLOW IT
TO THE LETTER,

18:22.684 --> 18:23.310
IT CANNOT FAIL.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.320
- [sighs]

18:33.403 --> 18:37.491
EDDIE, I STILL HAVE
FEELINGS FOR YOU.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.660
UM, EDDIE,

18:39.743 --> 18:41.370
I'VE NEVER STOPPED LIKING YOU.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.664
[sighs]

18:43.747 --> 18:45.707
JUST BE HONEST.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.168
7:55.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.128
[music swells]

19:10.732 --> 19:11.817
- WHY DO THINGS HAVE TO BE
SO COMPLICATED?

19:11.900 --> 19:13.694
- YOU SHOULD ASK PATRICIA,

19:13.777 --> 19:15.571
QUEEN OF COMPLICATED.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.072
- HUH?

19:17.155 --> 19:18.740
- IT'S THIS--THIS MEETING
SHE WANTS TONIGHT.

19:18.824 --> 19:19.783
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'VE DONE WRONG.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.743
- MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING WRONG?

19:21.827 --> 19:23.036
- IT'S PATRICIA.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.037
COURSE I HAVE.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.205
- YEAH, GOOD POINT.

19:32.754 --> 19:36.258
[music swells]

19:39.094 --> 19:40.429
- [sighs]

19:41.680 --> 19:43.098
- I FINALLY THOUGHT
WE WERE GETTING TO A PLACE

19:43.182 --> 19:45.767
WHERE WE COULD BE FRIENDS AGAIN,
YOU KNOW?

19:45.851 --> 19:46.435
[sighs]
I DON'T EVEN--

19:46.518 --> 19:47.269
[cell phone chimes]

19:55.027 --> 19:56.737
MAN, GIRLS ARE WEIRD.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.822
CATCH YOU LATER.

19:58.906 --> 19:59.823
- GOOD LUCK.

19:59.907 --> 20:00.782
- THANKS.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.242
I'M GONNA NEED IT.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.165
[door slams]

20:15.505 --> 20:17.966
[sighs]

20:18.050 --> 20:19.593
EDDIE, WHERE ARE YOU?

20:22.763 --> 20:24.765
- PATRICIA?

20:29.227 --> 20:31.480
YOU PICK THE WEIRDEST PLACES
TO MEET.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.320
- SO?
HOW'D IT GO WITH EDDIE?

20:38.403 --> 20:40.155
- DIDN'T.

20:40.238 --> 20:41.657
HE STOOD ME UP.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.532
- NO WAY.

20:42.616 --> 20:43.992
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE HIM.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.827
CALL HIM.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.663
- WHERE IS MY PHONE?

20:47.746 --> 20:48.747
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

20:48.830 --> 20:49.998
- I'M CALLING IT.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.166
DON'T WORRY.
IT'LL BE IN MY ROOM.
