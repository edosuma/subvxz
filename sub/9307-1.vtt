02:22.000 --> 02:23.250
This is your children?

02:23.417 --> 02:24.247
Yes I do.

02:32.334 --> 02:34.674
- Do not you have parents? - Yes, there.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.830
It's your daughter? She has a mother?

02:54.750 --> 02:56.250
It's your daughter?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.620
Tu n'as pas de tente?

03:12.042 --> 03:13.542
You know anyone here?

03:14.875 --> 03:16.115
This is your children?

03:17.375 --> 03:18.705
Those two, yes.

03:19.167 --> 03:20.787
She is my niece.

03:21.709 --> 03:22.999
Where is his mother?

03:23.250 --> 03:24.500
She is dead.

03:32.417 --> 03:34.827
Do not you cry, you say nothing.

03:39.625 --> 03:41.915
That's my girl. She is 9 years old.

03:43.834 --> 03:45.674
It's my daughter. She is 9 years old.

03:47.875 --> 03:49.075
It suits you?

03:55.625 --> 03:56.825
T'as quel âge?

03:57.834 --> 04:00.674
- 26 years. - No, your real age!

04:01.417 --> 04:02.367
26 years.

04:03.584 --> 04:05.254
You do not look like the photo.

04:05.417 --> 04:06.957
Attache your hair.

04:07.417 --> 04:08.667
And losing weight.

04:10.709 --> 04:13.039
Natarajan Dheepan he was 35 years old.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.997
Sa femme, Waterside, 24 ans.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.672
Their daughter, Illayaal, 9 years.

04:20.166 --> 04:22.036
They died 6 months ago.

04:22.792 --> 04:25.212
Now that family is you.

04:45.334 --> 04:47.674
This really is your daughter?

04:49.917 --> 04:51.417
It's your family?

04:54.292 --> 04:55.462
You know her?

04:56.167 --> 04:58.207
No. Why?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.710
You're gonna leave us here?

05:03.167 --> 05:06.207
No, but it is you who in occupied. Including?

05:09.792 --> 05:11.422
Where we take the plane?

05:12.584 --> 05:13.754
At Madras.

05:19.625 --> 05:21.415
Where we arrive in England?

05:21.959 --> 05:23.459
We're not in England.

05:28.250 --> 05:29.500
Where are we going, then?

05:30.084 --> 05:31.294
And France.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.920
The first half, move!

05:35.709 --> 05:37.499
Hurry, first boat!

05:38.167 --> 05:41.327
Other second boat! Go forward!

05:42.584 --> 05:44.504
Hurry!

07:38.959 --> 07:41.539
Dheepan! The cops, cops, come!

08:09.125 --> 08:11.035
Fuck! I can not anymore.

09:07.709 --> 09:08.919
Get up.

09:13.625 --> 09:14.995
T'as de l'argent?

09:16.625 --> 09:18.165
In the jacket.

09:19.042 --> 09:20.462
Closes the pane.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.002
Goes further, we need to talk.

11:20.792 --> 11:22.582
It's not going to work.

11:22.917 --> 11:24.957
They will see that we lied.

11:25.625 --> 11:26.745
What do you propose?

11:26.917 --> 11:28.537
I can not wait.

11:28.709 --> 11:30.619
I go to my cousin in England.

11:30.875 --> 11:32.075
With the small?

11:32.625 --> 11:34.955
Why would it be for me to take?

11:37.084 --> 11:38.964
You found it, you the guards.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.872
I worked for an NGO.

11:51.209 --> 11:53.749
I was a journalist peace activist.

11:54.334 --> 11:57.044
And the Sri Lankan government accused me of ...

11:57.584 --> 11:59.004
I know your history ...

11:59.167 --> 12:00.707
The "peace activist".

12:01.542 --> 12:03.712
It's your smuggler who sold it to you?

12:03.875 --> 12:06.165
You were on which side during the war?

12:07.292 --> 12:08.212
And you?

12:17.875 --> 12:19.415
What is your real name?

12:22.042 --> 12:23.252
Sivadhasan.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.580
I thought you were dead. Your family still there?

12:37.709 --> 12:39.209
They all died.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.459
I said what?

12:42.625 --> 12:45.325
Tell him that the Tigers have recruited you force

12:45.500 --> 12:49.000
and that the Sri Lankan army hath captured, tortured,

12:49.167 --> 12:51.207
and they tried to kill you.

12:52.042 --> 12:53.962
I was wanted by the army.

12:54.125 --> 12:57.165
They tortured me and tried to kill me.

13:22.084 --> 13:24.424
You sure this is the right train?

13:32.084 --> 13:33.754
What does that mean, "Le Pré"?

13:34.917 --> 13:37.077
"Le Pré", what does that mean?

13:37.792 --> 13:39.462
This is where we will live.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.325
What does it mean?

13:52.417 --> 13:54.787
This is a small meadow, pasture.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.205
I will have my room?

15:14.792 --> 15:16.792
I dunno. We'll see later.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.999
Someone there?

15:54.292 --> 15:56.672
Try to translate what he says.

16:01.334 --> 16:03.504
He talks too fast. I do not understand.

16:03.667 --> 16:04.617
It is not serious.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.250
Asked whether the water is drinkable.

16:59.334 --> 17:00.834
He talked about us?

17:01.167 --> 17:01.957
Not.

17:29.709 --> 17:32.079
You must wait until they are gone.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.620
Milk, honey, sugar and lentils

17:41.792 --> 17:44.422
I gathered these foods and I offer them.

17:44.792 --> 17:47.502
Oh god with an elephant head, like a pure diamond,

17:47.709 --> 17:50.119
Give me the three Tamil "Sangam".

17:51.125 --> 17:52.245
O God Ganesh!

17:53.167 --> 17:55.167
Do that no problem

17:55.709 --> 17:57.579
and that all is well here.

18:09.084 --> 18:10.254
Come eat.

18:14.000 --> 18:14.870
Here.

18:31.417 --> 18:32.707
Take a spoon.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.330
It can eat with your fingers.

18:37.125 --> 18:40.165
Tomorrow in school, she will have to eat with a spoon.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.747
I can not find my satchel.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.035
Go to bed.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.710
T'as un oreiller?

19:04.875 --> 19:06.415
You're a child!

19:06.584 --> 19:07.874
You not need it.

19:09.375 --> 19:10.995
I'll sleep there.

19:11.834 --> 19:13.294
Put yourself further.

21:25.542 --> 21:27.172
What does she say?

21:30.334 --> 21:31.874
How "government" is said?

22:08.959 --> 22:14.039
They ask many questions. That burned the school, why, how?

22:14.209 --> 22:16.119
Everyone burns schools.

22:16.292 --> 22:17.462
Why do you say that?

22:17.625 --> 22:18.665
I do not want!

22:18.875 --> 22:20.665
I want to stay with you!

22:23.209 --> 22:24.579
Not let me!

22:24.750 --> 22:25.750
Look at me.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.790
It was a secret, all three.

22:30.959 --> 22:32.119
I want to go.

22:32.542 --> 22:34.462
Do not forget it.

22:34.875 --> 22:38.075
We, the adults, we have to work.

22:38.959 --> 22:39.829
And you,

22:40.375 --> 22:43.035
you have to go to school and learn French.

22:44.375 --> 22:46.865
You have to speak like other children.

22:47.459 --> 22:49.919
Otherwise, we will return to our country.

22:50.292 --> 22:51.962
Did you want to return?

22:52.542 --> 22:53.622
T'as envie?

22:55.625 --> 22:56.665
Neither do I.

22:58.209 --> 22:59.329
Look at me.

22:59.959 --> 23:00.919
Look at me!

23:01.459 --> 23:02.579
You and you're going?

23:03.959 --> 23:04.919
Get up.

23:06.084 --> 23:07.004
vas-y.

23:19.209 --> 23:20.329
Zaoui.

23:21.125 --> 23:22.075
Building B.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.420
"Z".

23:27.167 --> 23:29.367
Samir Ben Cherif. "S" ...

23:31.959 --> 23:34.289
Here, try. Sorts that.

23:35.459 --> 23:36.579
He.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.000
"D"...

23:39.667 --> 23:41.117
It is easy.

23:41.959 --> 23:45.539
I do not know them. You can not ask Youssouf?

23:45.875 --> 23:49.415
What's he going to think if mind all the time?

23:50.084 --> 23:51.334
Everyone has a locker.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.040
People hit you their works.

23:54.334 --> 23:56.794
They take their mail and voila.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.120
And after?

23:59.792 --> 24:01.212
I tell them what?

24:01.375 --> 24:02.955
You want to tell them what?

24:07.709 --> 24:10.869
You present yourself, you are friendly and that's it.

24:25.250 --> 24:26.960
Dheepan!

24:27.375 --> 24:28.495
I am here.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.620
- Come! - What for?

24:31.334 --> 24:32.624
Come quick!

24:32.875 --> 24:33.825
Why?

24:54.042 --> 24:57.172
If you do not know, why are you telling me to do?

24:57.334 --> 24:58.544
Let them talk.

24:58.709 --> 25:01.539
You understand them, you? I look for what?

25:01.709 --> 25:02.789
Tais-toi!

25:20.500 --> 25:21.670
What do you want?

25:21.875 --> 25:23.245
She's crying.

25:25.084 --> 25:28.004
It's nothing. She's tired. Go to bed.

25:35.709 --> 25:36.619
What now?

25:38.084 --> 25:39.794
Can I stay with you?

25:41.250 --> 25:42.040
One.

26:01.875 --> 26:04.825
It must have been a child's room.

26:13.750 --> 26:19.120
"The involvement of India in the conflict against the Tamil Tigers ..."

26:28.584 --> 26:32.464
Give me a kiss, like everyone else.

29:59.084 --> 30:02.254
I can not do everything alone.

30:03.834 --> 30:06.294
It is as if I had two kids on our hands!

30:06.625 --> 30:08.325
You can not work, you?

30:08.500 --> 30:11.460
And that is not work?

30:11.625 --> 30:13.785
Work out, for pay.

30:14.584 --> 30:17.174
When I go out, everyone looks at me.

30:17.584 --> 30:20.424
It is new, it's normal that we look.

30:20.917 --> 30:21.997
We will do it.

30:25.542 --> 30:28.542
Here, many women wear a headscarf.

30:28.834 --> 30:30.754
You could do the same.

30:31.250 --> 30:33.040
The scarf is not my religion.

30:33.292 --> 30:34.922
I will not talk about religion.

30:35.167 --> 30:38.117
But to do like everyone else. And...

30:38.334 --> 30:41.334
stop making the mouth whenever I say something!

31:07.250 --> 31:09.870
This is an old man of Building G.

31:10.042 --> 31:12.002
Cooking and cleaning.

31:22.125 --> 31:23.415
It's well paid.

31:23.667 --> 31:24.707
How many?

31:26.000 --> 31:29.790
Many, but act as if it was normal. 500.

31:30.792 --> 31:31.922
500 euros?

31:32.209 --> 31:35.169
What I said to you? Accepts, that's all.

31:43.084 --> 31:45.044
Who will take care of Illayaal?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.330
I'll take care.

31:57.042 --> 31:58.422
500?

32:00.084 --> 32:02.004
You calculate in rupees?

32:03.042 --> 32:05.752
- For a month ... - 500 multiplied by 170 ...

32:06.250 --> 32:07.710
85000th?

35:41.417 --> 35:44.707
- Who's the type? - I do not know, like those below.

35:44.917 --> 35:46.327
What are they doing with the old?

35:46.500 --> 35:48.830
They remain locked up in the living room.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.540
They talk as if it was their office.

35:51.875 --> 35:53.915
- Who is it? - Thugs.

35:54.292 --> 35:57.292
Gang? As Vannilas and Minnal?

35:59.167 --> 36:01.787
A little similar, but less dangerous.

36:02.792 --> 36:06.002
Youssouf said it is normal here.

37:42.292 --> 37:43.582
What does it say?

37:44.500 --> 37:45.830
This is poetry.

37:46.250 --> 37:47.710
On friendship.

38:09.334 --> 38:10.794
Are you kidding me?

38:12.500 --> 38:14.080
Who do you think You Are?

38:15.625 --> 38:17.995
I want to see you! Out!

38:21.834 --> 38:23.374
I hate you!

38:40.667 --> 38:43.577
My mother is dead! I have no mother.

38:44.500 --> 38:47.670
You could still be nice to me.

38:47.834 --> 38:51.044
I know how to do with children.

38:51.209 --> 38:52.419
I know nothing.

38:55.959 --> 38:58.289
You had children in Sri Lanka?

39:04.000 --> 39:06.120
Brothers, sisters?

39:10.417 --> 39:11.707
Two little brothers.

39:14.209 --> 39:16.499
You were not kind to them?

39:18.292 --> 39:19.172
And!

39:21.250 --> 39:23.580
Why do not you do the same with me.

48:55.625 --> 48:57.785
I can ask you a question?

49:00.084 --> 49:02.584
You find them funny, you, the people here?

49:04.625 --> 49:06.075
I dunno. Why?

49:09.750 --> 49:12.250
Sometimes they say things and they laugh.

49:12.917 --> 49:14.867
I understand all the words,

49:15.500 --> 49:16.870
but I find it funny.

49:20.292 --> 49:22.292
It is not a question of language.

49:22.875 --> 49:23.915
What is it then?

49:26.084 --> 49:28.124
It is a question of humor.

49:30.834 --> 49:32.214
On French humor?

49:36.125 --> 49:37.575
On any short humor.

49:41.209 --> 49:43.249
You're not funny.

49:44.625 --> 49:46.825
Even in Tamil, you're not funny.

49:51.417 --> 49:52.457
Never?

50:01.375 --> 50:02.245
What?

50:04.750 --> 50:06.620
That's good.

50:07.417 --> 50:08.207
What?

50:10.167 --> 50:12.747
When talking like that, that's fine.

55:47.584 --> 55:49.834
Your turn.

56:20.459 --> 56:21.959
What are you doing?

56:30.042 --> 56:33.712
It's funny ... it's like the movies.

56:43.959 --> 56:45.579
You see that dog?

56:47.750 --> 56:49.250
I know him.

58:06.667 --> 58:08.287
I take everything?

58:10.042 --> 58:11.042
No, just that.

58:20.209 --> 58:21.999
First, we go to the temple.

58:23.334 --> 58:24.294
After that?

58:26.834 --> 58:28.424
You've taken everything?

58:28.917 --> 58:29.827
Fritters,

58:30.584 --> 58:31.674
the "rolls".

01:00:02.917 --> 01:00:04.537
Tu me parlais the Shoban.

01:00:04.709 --> 01:00:07.209
It is in Dortmund, now.

01:00:07.375 --> 01:00:09.495
You can have her number?

01:00:10.334 --> 01:00:11.834
You see Ravi?

01:00:12.334 --> 01:00:13.794
One who is in Dortmund.

01:00:15.042 --> 01:00:17.582
Ravi, can I have the number Shoban.

01:00:22.709 --> 01:00:25.169
My brother, you have crossed?

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:24.870
What's New?

01:01:25.459 --> 01:01:26.499
You know...

01:01:26.792 --> 01:01:30.502
The Greeks cut the head to the bearers of bad news.

01:01:31.709 --> 01:01:33.539
The colonel is Cheran.

01:01:33.834 --> 01:01:35.124
He wants to see you.

01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:38.115
- He is alone? - Yes.

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:45.830
Wait here.

01:01:59.709 --> 01:02:00.789
He's there.

01:02:07.834 --> 01:02:09.374
Attention softly.

01:02:10.875 --> 01:02:11.825
Gently.

01:02:13.584 --> 01:02:14.964
- How are you? - Yes.

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:17.000
You want some water?

01:02:18.792 --> 01:02:20.042
Tell him to come in.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:22.960
Between!

01:02:31.084 --> 01:02:32.214
Sivadhasan!

01:02:36.167 --> 01:02:37.537
It has been a long time.

01:02:38.167 --> 01:02:39.457
How are you?

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.420
I'm happy to see you.

01:02:45.959 --> 01:02:48.329
I was told that you had been beheaded

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.620
and had been identified you.

01:02:52.542 --> 01:02:54.252
I have an important mission.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.250
Look for money.

01:02:58.292 --> 01:03:00.332
I contacted the Lebanese.

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:04.330
They want $ 100,000 for weapons.

01:03:05.209 --> 01:03:08.369
Those here still support the cause?

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.080
Why do you want guns, sir?

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.080
To send the country!

01:03:18.959 --> 01:03:20.369
Who, in the country?

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.000
Comrades!

01:03:27.084 --> 01:03:28.084
Mon colonel,

01:03:28.959 --> 01:03:30.579
all is finished.

01:03:31.709 --> 01:03:34.209
At Nandhikadal, I lost all my section.

01:03:35.459 --> 01:03:37.039
My wife is dead.

01:03:37.292 --> 01:03:38.712
My children are dead.

01:03:39.417 --> 01:03:40.787
The war is over.

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:42.577
What are you saying?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.120
Say that again!

01:03:46.125 --> 01:03:47.205
Okay, sir.

01:03:47.917 --> 01:03:49.577
The war is not over.

01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:51.825
But for me...

01:03:52.042 --> 01:03:53.172
It's over.

01:04:07.042 --> 01:04:10.622
Go in search of the graves of our enemies

01:04:10.792 --> 01:04:15.332
And continue the struggle for Tamil!

01:04:15.625 --> 01:04:19.495
Our wounds will not close again

01:04:19.667 --> 01:04:24.287
But I never cease to dream

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:28.750
We are not so far away. See the border of our enemies!

01:04:29.209 --> 01:04:32.749
Go in search of the graves of our enemies

01:04:32.917 --> 01:04:37.037
And continue the struggle for Tamil!

01:04:37.834 --> 01:04:41.674
See all these ruined houses

01:04:41.834 --> 01:04:46.424
Soon they will be rebuilt

01:04:46.709 --> 01:04:50.829
Hear crying in the refugee camps

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.960
These children will be crying tomorrow Tigers

01:04:56.125 --> 01:05:00.205
Our sufferings were not written

01:05:00.417 --> 01:05:04.167
If all Tamils ​​united, there would be more opposite camp

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:06.174
Plus the adverse camp

01:05:06.334 --> 01:05:10.174
Pronounce the name of our leader and be ready to fight!

01:06:21.167 --> 01:06:22.997
It stinks of the mouth.

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:36.455
How are you?

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:39.210
What happened?

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.920
You sure are you?

01:06:48.084 --> 01:06:49.754
Why he slept with us?

01:06:49.917 --> 01:06:51.077
I do not know.

01:06:51.334 --> 01:06:53.424
He had a nightmare.

01:09:34.542 --> 01:09:36.292
This is not my daughter.

01:09:39.417 --> 01:09:41.037
Ni mon mari.

01:09:44.459 --> 01:09:45.669
Everything is false.

01:09:56.334 --> 01:09:58.174
Home ...

01:09:58.709 --> 01:10:02.289
You fall, you smile. You're hurting you, you smile.

01:10:04.292 --> 01:10:05.292
Here...

01:10:06.959 --> 01:10:08.619
If you smile too much,

01:10:09.584 --> 01:10:12.624
people believe that thou not understand

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:15.172
or you make fun of them.

01:13:19.584 --> 01:13:21.544
Go to your room!

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:25.620
- Why are they doing this? - Shut up!

01:13:26.042 --> 01:13:27.122
In your bedroom!

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.540
You sleep?

01:17:27.459 --> 01:17:28.619
What are you doing?

01:17:29.709 --> 01:17:31.329
- I'm leaving. - Or?

01:17:31.959 --> 01:17:32.919
En Angleterre.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:34.830
At my cousin's.

01:17:35.167 --> 01:17:36.577
I called.

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:38.540
We had to wait for our papers.

01:17:39.084 --> 01:17:42.124
I imagined that people would shoot it!

01:17:42.417 --> 01:17:45.077
It reminds you nothing, all that?

01:17:45.334 --> 01:17:47.674
This is not the same.

01:17:49.584 --> 01:17:50.754
Why?

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:54.035
Because there, it was you who was shooting?

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.870
It is that right?

01:18:06.334 --> 01:18:08.714
Your passport, how did you get?

01:18:11.084 --> 01:18:12.924
What do you believe?

01:18:13.625 --> 01:18:15.285
Are you going to stop me from leaving?

01:18:22.625 --> 01:18:23.865
I leave!

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:27.000
I will go to England.

01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:00.455
What are you meddling?

01:19:44.292 --> 01:19:45.872
Qu'est-ce que t'as?

01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:48.959
Let me go or I'll scream!

01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:02.749
You left without Illayaal?

01:20:04.667 --> 01:20:05.747
Yes I do.

01:20:08.125 --> 01:20:09.665
You can abandon it?

01:20:15.042 --> 01:20:16.752
You thought what?

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.080
You've come to believe that story?

01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:30.459
You think I'm his mother?

01:20:32.417 --> 01:20:34.327
She thinks I'm his mother?

01:20:38.459 --> 01:20:40.789
You're not my husband, Dheepan.

01:20:42.667 --> 01:20:44.667
I'm not your wife.

01:20:46.084 --> 01:20:47.874
And it's not our daughter.

01:21:11.292 --> 01:21:12.502
Spoken.

01:21:15.792 --> 01:21:17.042
But talking about!

01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:19.325
What?

01:21:20.834 --> 01:21:24.374
I will not move from here.

01:24:04.042 --> 01:24:05.212
No Fire Zone!

01:24:44.625 --> 01:24:47.285
The director wants you to sign this.

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:49.669
That is why?

01:24:50.292 --> 01:24:52.042
To make an appointment.

01:24:53.667 --> 01:24:54.497
Why?

01:24:55.334 --> 01:24:58.294
She wants to put me in a normal class.

01:25:00.209 --> 01:25:01.329
Come eat.

01:25:08.292 --> 01:25:09.672
What are you doing?

01:25:09.834 --> 01:25:11.624
I'll be back in 5 minutes.

01:25:38.334 --> 01:25:40.334
This is your new army?

01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:43.169
What is your plan?

01:25:43.459 --> 01:25:45.369
You're going to train?

01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:48.290
You gonna buy weapons?

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:55.960
You have everything?

01:25:56.125 --> 01:25:57.205
Yes I do.

01:27:32.542 --> 01:27:33.962
You went to see him?

01:27:34.459 --> 01:27:35.419
Not!

01:27:36.542 --> 01:27:38.252
Youssouf picked me.

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:39.670
Why you?

01:27:40.542 --> 01:27:42.582
Because he knows me.

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.250
Why not talk about me?

01:27:48.167 --> 01:27:49.367
What are you going to do?

01:27:50.125 --> 01:27:52.865
Why are you meddling us all?

01:27:53.209 --> 01:27:54.619
Who's "we"?

01:27:54.792 --> 01:27:58.622
A little thug threatens to kill me and you say it like that?

01:27:59.750 --> 01:28:01.620
It makes you neither hot nor cold?

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.460
- It's for your ... - Shut up!

01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:29.870
What do you want?

01:28:33.959 --> 01:28:35.459
Why are you touching me?

01:28:35.959 --> 01:28:37.209
Excuse-moi.

01:28:40.167 --> 01:28:41.617
It takes you like that?

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:46.960
I do not want!

01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:51.749
I do not want.

01:30:04.417 --> 01:30:06.037
Take off your coat.

01:30:27.375 --> 01:30:30.615
I can go on the anniversary of Yasmine?

01:30:31.209 --> 01:30:32.959
You ask Dad.

01:31:06.042 --> 01:31:07.832
What are you doing?

01:31:11.875 --> 01:31:13.495
When are you coming back?

01:31:16.209 --> 01:31:17.209
I dunno.

01:31:22.542 --> 01:31:24.922
I found the passport and money.

01:31:28.334 --> 01:31:29.294
Thank you.

01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:47.040
I'll call my cousin.

01:31:48.459 --> 01:31:51.329
I will go to England with Illayaal, after the summer.

01:31:52.917 --> 01:31:55.707
I will inform the school.

01:31:57.250 --> 01:31:58.170
Returns.

01:41:03.042 --> 01:41:05.422
Calm down, tell me what happens.

01:41:13.084 --> 01:41:14.674
Who will kill you?

01:41:21.625 --> 01:41:23.035
T'es où, là?

01:41:26.209 --> 01:41:27.539
T'es où?

01:45:44.792 --> 01:45:45.622
Do not move!

01:45:49.125 --> 01:45:50.115
Where is he?

01:45:50.834 --> 01:45:51.964
Where is he?

01:45:53.084 --> 01:45:54.254
He is dead.

01:45:59.417 --> 01:46:00.497
It's me.

01:46:08.125 --> 01:46:09.205
Look at me!

01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:30.000
All that blood ...

01:46:30.625 --> 01:46:31.825
Are you hurt?

01:46:33.542 --> 01:46:34.922
It's his blood.
