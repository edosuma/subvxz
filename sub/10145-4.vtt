James Leatherby, Ex-SAS,
smuggles drugs, dirty money.

00:05.429 --> 00:07.816
- A barman?
- He's just a friend.

00:07.936 --> 00:09.985
You belong to me.

00:10.105 --> 00:12.221
You want to get yourself
killed, go ahead. I'm through.

00:12.341 --> 00:15.361
- File from the CIA didn't mention a kid.
- Keep it that way.

00:15.381 --> 00:18.008
A man like Leo Kamali, he sells
himself as whatever you need him to be...

00:18.028 --> 00:20.112
CIA asset, terrorist,
money launderer.

00:20.232 --> 00:21.603
- I borrow some money.
- How much?

00:21.623 --> 00:22.484
$10,000.

00:22.504 --> 00:23.588
Confirm target.

00:23.598 --> 00:25.399
- Negative, it's a female.
- Bring her in.

00:25.519 --> 00:28.335
Consider yourself on extended
leave, effective immediately.

00:28.455 --> 00:30.602
I'm taking direct
command of this unit.

00:30.722 --> 00:33.968
I want you to bear one thing in mind...
I have absolutely nothing to lose.

Check the back of the house.

01:31.989 --> 01:33.557
Ester!

01:35.254 --> 01:36.930
You must go!

01:37.150 --> 01:38.930
I won't leave you!

01:39.150 --> 01:41.325
You are your father's daughter!

01:42.319 --> 01:43.822
It is you they are after!

02:03.993 --> 02:05.638
Go now!

02:21.881 --> 02:24.314
Get off me! Let me go! Get off!

02:41.956 --> 02:43.420
Where's your father?

02:45.222 --> 02:46.389
Spit in my face?

02:47.399 --> 02:49.264
Where is he?!

02:58.347 --> 03:00.180
Put her in the car.

03:01.319 --> 03:04.550
Let go! Let me go! Get off me!

03:08.993 --> 03:12.257
OK, Sofia, it's time to talk.

DOWNTOWN BEIRUT

04:34.050 --> 04:35.970
Leatherby has my daughter.

04:36.050 --> 04:38.220
He has Ester.

04:39.390 --> 04:42.080
- You stood in my home.
You made a promise. - Yeah.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.065
Well, I need your help.
You get her out for me.

04:45.690 --> 04:49.270
Whatever you think of me,
Ester is the one true thing I have left,

04:49.280 --> 04:51.567
and I wasn't there for her.

04:51.650 --> 04:55.072
Kamali, we said we had your back,
and we meant it.

04:55.113 --> 04:58.781
Now you need to let us do that.
You are no use to us dead.

04:59.195 --> 05:02.500
Leo, I swear to you that
we'll bring her home.

05:04.350 --> 05:05.740
Ok.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.670
Colonel, we're gonna go
get his daughter back.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.855
- Then I'll need something from you.
- Anything.

05:16.060 --> 05:17.860
You know this place
better than anyone else.

05:17.895 --> 05:20.380
Sofia Abboud is the
only lead we have,

05:20.390 --> 05:23.140
our only chance to find out
what Al-Zuhari is planning.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.860
Find me Dalton.

05:28.420 --> 05:32.365
- Does your father love you, Sofia?
- Of course.

05:34.175 --> 05:37.626
You know he's been giving
financial aid to Al-Zuhari,

05:38.040 --> 05:41.976
and you know about the atrocity Al-Zuhari
staged in Jordan last year.

05:42.035 --> 05:44.100
Politics does not interest me.

05:45.850 --> 05:49.324
The victims of that Jordan attack...
they weren't just U.S. Military personnel...

05:49.557 --> 05:53.825
they were women and children,
Muslims, too.

05:55.565 --> 05:57.666
They're your people, Sofia.

05:58.106 --> 06:01.130
Your father gave you a message
to give to Al-Zuhari, didn't he?

06:01.137 --> 06:05.307
- Why have you brought me here?
- He's using you, manipulating you.

06:05.579 --> 06:09.359
That's not love.
You're a pawn.

06:09.784 --> 06:13.251
And you? What are you?

06:13.484 --> 06:15.788
Are you even a woman?

06:15.921 --> 06:19.427
You have a husband,
children, anyone?

06:19.730 --> 06:21.696
Who are you?

06:21.829 --> 06:26.598
You talk to me about
love, but who loves you?

06:26.631 --> 06:29.366
- Who do you love?
- Enough!

06:34.890 --> 06:36.446
It's simple.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.113
You find Dalton, you call me,

06:39.750 --> 06:41.382
we bring her in.

06:43.322 --> 06:46.361
Leo, don't worry about Ester.

06:56.220 --> 06:57.410
Do you believe in God?

06:58.547 --> 07:01.148
Because if you do,
you should pray

07:01.281 --> 07:04.187
that your father very
quickly comes to understand

07:04.320 --> 07:07.890
and accept the cost of betrayal.

07:10.253 --> 07:13.787
Life's not fair, is it?

07:14.050 --> 07:16.653
Someone always gets left behind.

07:19.287 --> 07:21.962
Once upon a time it was me,

07:22.095 --> 07:24.058
and this time...

07:26.126 --> 07:28.235
it's you.

07:38.081 --> 07:41.723
You feel sorry for her, don't you?

07:43.293 --> 07:45.600
That's why I
keep you around...

07:45.733 --> 07:49.904
to remind me of how I used to feel.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.937
So we let Kamali have
his daughter back,

07:51.970 --> 07:54.740
and he gives us the diamonds.

07:54.881 --> 07:57.516
Kamali fucked with me.
He's mine.

07:57.649 --> 07:59.350
You...

08:00.473 --> 08:03.429
you find me some other man.

08:04.792 --> 08:06.529
Ok.

08:06.992 --> 08:08.530
Ok.

08:17.974 --> 08:20.614
Every Englishman
has his castle, huh?

08:20.785 --> 08:23.320
- Yeah, but he's Scottish.
- There's a difference?

08:23.353 --> 08:26.688
Yeah. The Scots like to fight
and eat deep-fried Mars Bars,

08:26.721 --> 08:29.025
and the English are never
wrong about anything.

08:29.058 --> 08:31.132
His compound is 18
clicks east of here.

08:31.165 --> 08:34.671
- Security?
- Up to 20 hired guns.

08:35.850 --> 08:37.870
The guy doesn't do subtle, huh?

08:46.819 --> 08:49.983
What is it, Mikey? You
thinking about Dalton?

08:50.828 --> 08:52.920
Yeah, a bit.

08:53.173 --> 08:56.061
Yeah, in my eyes, dude,
Locke made the right choice.

08:56.594 --> 08:58.563
She had it coming.
She's a fucking psycho.

08:58.596 --> 09:01.768
The problem I'm having is that nobody
recognized it till it was too late, man.

09:01.801 --> 09:04.535
Well, we did, but what
can we do, you know?

09:04.568 --> 09:07.968
No, not us.
The suits at the top.

09:08.009 --> 09:10.276
They always want their
pound of flesh, don't they?

09:16.884 --> 09:18.716
Just to make sure,
Richmond, Kim. Hmm?

09:18.857 --> 09:20.713
You're taking sniper
positions on the roof.

09:20.724 --> 09:22.923
Scott and I are gonna grab
Ester and head for the exfil.

09:22.926 --> 09:24.904
If anyone has a chance
to grab Leatherby,

09:24.907 --> 09:27.004
we use him to get intel
on the Abboud woman.

09:27.006 --> 09:28.767
- Copy that.
- Roger that.

09:53.652 --> 09:55.792
How's the hand?

09:56.720 --> 09:58.360
It hurts.

10:00.432 --> 10:02.204
I'm sorry.

10:02.587 --> 10:05.973
- These things happen.
- I said I'm fucking sorry, didn't I?

10:12.820 --> 10:14.450
Thank you.

10:15.987 --> 10:18.722
Thank you for pulling
me from the car.

10:19.618 --> 10:21.785
Thank you.

10:23.354 --> 10:30.363
You know, sometimes I wish you
had the guts to fucking hate me.

11:35.741 --> 11:37.141
Where's the girl?

11:38.243 --> 11:41.547
- What did he say?
- I think he said "No English."

11:41.580 --> 11:43.013
See that?

11:44.302 --> 11:45.776
Where's the girl?

11:45.779 --> 11:48.223
- I'll take you there.
- Thought so.

11:48.256 --> 11:52.156
- You should consider teaching English
as a second language, mate. - I am.

12:09.609 --> 12:11.415
Ester, come here.

12:14.082 --> 12:18.190
All right, put this on you.
Hurry. It's a little bit sweaty.

12:18.231 --> 12:20.963
Slip into that.
Sorry, it's a bit big.

12:20.996 --> 12:24.230
It's not made for kids.
Usually fat Americans.

12:24.263 --> 12:27.338
Target acquired.
Two seconds, Mike.

12:28.908 --> 12:30.978
Bravo one and two
headed for exfil now.

12:37.454 --> 12:38.685
Mike.

12:43.954 --> 12:46.688
I have Leatherby.
Repeat, I have Leatherby.

12:46.729 --> 12:48.962
Fuck. Let's take him with us.

12:49.931 --> 12:51.466
I'm coming to you.

12:51.499 --> 12:54.130
- Roger.
- Copy that.

13:06.551 --> 13:08.086
On your 10.

13:18.628 --> 13:19.684
Coming to you.

13:19.697 --> 13:21.504
Go. Move, move.

13:25.611 --> 13:27.138
Come with me.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.148
Over there. Over there!
Mike!

13:52.472 --> 13:53.902
Set.

13:53.943 --> 13:57.174
Get in the fucking
car, you fucking idiot!

14:12.150 --> 14:14.900
HEZBOLLAH COMPOUND
EAST BEIRUT

14:15.092 --> 14:18.489
- Hello.
- Commander, I need a favor.

14:19.498 --> 14:21.165
Of course.

14:21.298 --> 14:22.794
Of course.

14:24.204 --> 14:25.532
Ok. Ok.

14:30.404 --> 14:33.499
First firefight, huh?
You kicked ass, kid.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.077
- Well done.
- Thank you.

14:36.087 --> 14:37.686
All of you, thank
you very much, though.

14:37.719 --> 14:39.405
Now look what you did.
You made him blush.

14:39.415 --> 14:42.219
Fuck off... I mean,
knock it off. Knock it off, I said.

14:42.222 --> 14:46.774
Excuse him. You'll find that Sergeant Scott
has a very limited vocabulary.

14:47.357 --> 14:48.829
Zero, this is Bravo One.

14:49.010 --> 14:52.199
We have the primary package,
but Leatherby is very much in play. Over.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.469
<i>Zero. Roger, Bravo One.</i>

14:54.502 --> 14:58.237
- Anything from Kamali on Major Dalton?
- No word from Kamali yet, sir.

15:05.943 --> 15:07.917
You're crazy!

15:08.350 --> 15:11.014
I told you I don't know anything!

15:13.191 --> 15:14.856
What are you doing?

15:50.424 --> 15:52.790
What's the message, Sofia?

15:54.947 --> 15:58.530
- No? - There is... there
is no message.

15:59.380 --> 16:01.796
- There is no message.
- No message?

16:05.375 --> 16:07.508
Last chance, Sofia.

16:08.441 --> 16:10.176
Oh, no...

16:11.217 --> 16:12.782
No.

16:21.818 --> 16:24.507
- It looks like we're in Hezbollah
territory. - No kidding.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.584
Someone hung the bunting out.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.151
It's a welcoming committee.

16:28.192 --> 16:32.422
- Shit. Roadblock. - Shit.
- Heads up. We've got company.

16:36.080 --> 16:39.300
- Coming at us on the left.
- Yeah, they're Hezbollah, all right. - Fuck!

16:41.964 --> 16:43.362
Ester, will you get in
the back for me, please?

16:43.403 --> 16:44.869
We've got them on our left.

16:46.034 --> 16:47.967
Right behind us. Guessing they're
friends of Leatherby's.

16:48.070 --> 16:50.598
- On our 6.
- And more on our 9.

16:52.301 --> 16:55.502
- Bomber blocking our 6.
- Head for the hut. - Copy that.

16:57.603 --> 16:59.338
Go, go, go!

16:59.371 --> 17:01.548
Run, run!

17:06.411 --> 17:07.983
Run!

17:09.214 --> 17:10.582
Close it up!

17:12.184 --> 17:14.654
- You all right?
- Yeah.

17:14.686 --> 17:16.453
Zero, this is Bravo team.

17:16.486 --> 17:18.854
Yeah, we ran into a Hezbollah
roadblock and lost our ride.

17:18.887 --> 17:20.992
Zero. Roger.

17:21.025 --> 17:23.432
It looks like Hezbollah
is jamming our visuals,

17:23.464 --> 17:26.165
but we'll continue to
monitor their comms.

17:26.798 --> 17:29.026
Keep comms open at all times.

17:30.162 --> 17:32.799
Shit.
There's Leatherby.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.931
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's find an exit.

17:34.942 --> 17:36.992
- Honey, can you come with me?
- Yeah. Move.

17:37.005 --> 17:38.075
Let's go.

17:38.108 --> 17:42.005
- Ladies, you stay here.
We'll be right back. - Copy that.

17:45.344 --> 17:48.779
If this is British Special Forces,
they'll be monitoring Hezbollah comms.

17:48.820 --> 17:51.417
Find me the channel.

17:53.554 --> 17:56.120
No. No! No! No!

18:06.606 --> 18:08.539
What's the message, Sofia?

18:11.709 --> 18:14.909
- There is no message.
- No?

18:14.943 --> 18:18.382
- This is how it's gonna be.
- No!

18:31.030 --> 18:34.329
Why, Sofia, would you do
this for Al-Zuhari?

18:34.662 --> 18:37.164
- Please.
- No.

18:41.533 --> 18:45.219
Because I love him.

19:13.103 --> 19:17.288
You say that it's
Al-Zuhari that is a monster,

19:18.010 --> 19:21.116
a butcher, a fanatic.

19:22.754 --> 19:25.019
But you know nothing about him.

19:25.052 --> 19:27.494
So why don't you tell me?

19:29.661 --> 19:32.094
Al-Zuhari is kind,

19:32.627 --> 19:34.269
generous,

19:35.702 --> 19:37.405
and gentle.

19:42.306 --> 19:46.927
- Who are you?
- I'm Al-Zuhari's wife.

19:50.318 --> 19:52.548
He's here, isn't he?

19:53.001 --> 19:54.883
He brought you to meet him.

19:54.916 --> 19:56.586
Kill me.

19:58.621 --> 20:01.127
I will never tell you.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.891
Kamali.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.278
You've been in Beirut
for 3 months.

20:40.311 --> 20:44.016
I've known your every move.
This is my world.

20:46.252 --> 20:48.455
Locke sent me.

20:50.389 --> 20:52.028
Where is the woman?

20:52.925 --> 20:54.531
She's here.

20:55.563 --> 20:57.760
I want to help you.

20:57.793 --> 21:00.197
You?
Can help me?

21:00.230 --> 21:03.395
We both want the same thing.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.298
And what is that, exactly?

21:06.331 --> 21:09.400
To find Al-Zuhari.
To stop him.

21:15.606 --> 21:17.737
She's his wife.

21:18.267 --> 21:20.799
Then she is the key.
You were right.

21:20.832 --> 21:23.869
Rachel, for what it's worth,

21:23.902 --> 21:25.940
let me speak to her.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.480
Gun.

21:41.516 --> 21:43.283
Phone.

21:47.288 --> 21:50.688
- Can I?
- Be my guest.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.201
The Sofia Abboud file, sir.

22:07.346 --> 22:09.546
You're a long way from Hereford.

22:12.616 --> 22:14.643
Get me voice on that channel.

22:15.667 --> 22:16.985
Sir.

22:17.890 --> 22:19.586
Leatherby?

22:20.719 --> 22:23.491
- Who is this?
- This is Philip Locke.

22:23.824 --> 22:26.959
<i>The Philip Locke I've
heard so much about?</i>

22:27.392 --> 22:31.030
I always thought you were an overrated
little fucking dwarf, myself.

22:31.063 --> 22:33.103
Possibly, but I wasn't the one

22:33.136 --> 22:36.440
capture by Saddam's
weekend warriors, was I?

22:37.808 --> 22:40.206
<i>Let my boys go, James.</i>

22:40.240 --> 22:43.251
They're just out
there doing their job.

22:43.284 --> 22:45.020
<i>You have
my word...</i>

22:45.053 --> 22:48.554
when I'm done, I will
carve out their hearts

22:48.587 --> 22:52.020
and send them back
marked for your attention.

22:53.657 --> 22:56.726
These boys won't
beat the clock, Phil.

22:57.260 --> 22:59.168
Don't count on it.

23:30.347 --> 23:32.211
Oh, my God.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.330
We're gonna head for the roof
and look for an exit there, yeah?

23:39.335 --> 23:40.620
- Let's do it.
- Let's move.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.090
Yeah, moving.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.810
- I'll have a peek left, yeah?
- Right. You ready?

23:51.120 --> 23:52.730
Go, go, go, go.

23:53.130 --> 23:55.320
Ester, stand there.
Come on.

23:59.590 --> 24:01.840
I said stay over there, kid.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.730
Is my dad some kind of spy?

24:04.270 --> 24:05.750
Get down.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.590
That's the kind of question
you should ask him.

24:11.260 --> 24:12.990
Do you have a family?

24:13.440 --> 24:17.490
Yeah. I got some parents,
live in separate states,

24:17.710 --> 24:19.650
which is great for the family.

24:20.380 --> 24:22.200
I got a couple of brothers.

24:23.060 --> 24:26.135
- They're idiots.
- No, I meant of your own.

24:30.630 --> 24:32.850
You ask a lot of
questions, huh, kid?

24:33.610 --> 24:36.670
- You got a cigarette?
- Didn't get to the shop today.

24:47.760 --> 24:49.400
<i>Zero, over.</i>

24:49.560 --> 24:51.740
Yeah. This is Bravo One. Come in.

24:51.775 --> 24:53.045
What's your position?

24:53.050 --> 24:55.320
Right now we're stuck between
a rock and a hard Scot.

24:55.350 --> 24:58.140
It looks like Hezbollah has
locked down the whole of Dahieh.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.810
You know if there was
anything we could do...

25:01.270 --> 25:02.905
Yeah. I understand.

25:02.940 --> 25:05.460
Be advised, new intel
on Sofia Abboud.

25:05.990 --> 25:07.820
She's Al-Zuhari's wife.

25:07.830 --> 25:09.965
- Shit.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

25:10.030 --> 25:11.660
Do you have a location
on Dalton yet?

25:11.695 --> 25:14.845
That's a negative. If she's broken
Abboud, she'll be headed

25:14.850 --> 25:17.210
for wherever that woman
was going to be taken.

25:17.245 --> 25:17.995
<i>And...</i>

25:18.030 --> 25:21.400
Yeah. And Leatherby's the only other person
who knows where that's at.

25:21.410 --> 25:22.810
That's a roger.

25:23.010 --> 25:27.790
And, Bravo One, let's get that
address from Leatherby. Out.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.020
Up on the roof.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.610
What are we waiting for?

25:36.060 --> 25:38.090
Let's kill those bastards, huh?

26:03.020 --> 26:06.380
All right, boys.
This is where it ends.

26:06.415 --> 26:09.460
We have done with Hope and Honor.

26:12.030 --> 26:13.410
Mike!

26:14.320 --> 26:16.730
You all right? Ester, come with me.

26:18.910 --> 26:22.000
We are lost to Love and Truth.

26:25.170 --> 26:26.710
- Fuck!
- What is it?

26:26.720 --> 26:29.090
- God have mercy...
- You're OK. You're OK.

26:29.091 --> 26:30.494
On such as we.

26:30.495 --> 26:33.575
Fuck.
Ester! Ester!

26:38.650 --> 26:40.240
Come on. Let's go.

26:40.660 --> 26:42.040
Keep down.

26:47.330 --> 26:49.730
I am not leaving my lads out there.

26:52.340 --> 26:54.095
- Let's move.
- Yes, sir.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.110
Go!

27:05.110 --> 27:07.085
- Scott! On me.
- Come here! Come here!

27:08.550 --> 27:09.970
Move, move, move!

27:10.020 --> 27:12.050
Changing! Changing!

27:14.340 --> 27:16.085
- Mikey!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:20.990 --> 27:22.980
- Thanks.
- De nada.

27:26.330 --> 27:28.090
- Move.
- Ok.

27:31.790 --> 27:33.560
Gun overhead. Get down.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.330
Don't shoot him.
Don't shoot him.

27:42.380 --> 27:44.150
That's Leatherby's boyfriend.

27:45.810 --> 27:47.760
I'd better go up
there, take him alive,

27:47.790 --> 27:50.322
force his sugar daddy to tell
us where he took the woman.

27:50.325 --> 27:51.699
Yeah, roger that.

27:51.705 --> 27:54.115
- Ester, stay with the girls, all right?
- Yeah.

27:54.150 --> 27:57.110
Behave for them, all right?

27:57.180 --> 27:58.610
Moving.

28:04.610 --> 28:07.940
This is Zero. Bravo
One, we're on our way.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.065
Hands up. Come here.
Come here.

28:20.100 --> 28:24.690
It's OK. It's OK. I...
It's OK. I can help you.

28:24.710 --> 28:26.270
I can help you.

28:27.740 --> 28:30.030
Oi, Braveheart!

28:30.061 --> 28:31.461
Hold your fire!

28:31.670 --> 28:35.600
We need to talk. Does
this belong to you? Huh?

28:39.040 --> 28:41.180
- Give me 10 minutes.
- Gotcha.

28:42.430 --> 28:43.750
All right.

28:50.810 --> 28:55.720
Sofia, you have to tell this woman

28:55.755 --> 28:58.560
<i>what you know!</i>

29:00.100 --> 29:01.861
Make no reaction!

29:01.902 --> 29:03.892
I am a friend to your husband.

29:04.588 --> 29:07.493
He has a name for you.
The Light of my Two Eyes.

29:09.530 --> 29:13.370
Were you to meet Al-Zuhari?

29:17.211 --> 29:19.571
I will get you out of here.

29:20.022 --> 29:21.752
Take my car.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.020
Shh.

29:34.820 --> 29:36.910
I'll leave you to think about it.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.990
What did you say to her?

29:48.940 --> 29:51.110
That I'd let her get out of here.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.540
She'll never tell us
where Al-Zuhari is,

29:54.550 --> 29:56.725
but if we let her escape,

29:56.760 --> 29:58.900
she will lead us to him.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.000
What do you want?

30:08.260 --> 30:10.550
A free ride home, hmm?

30:12.410 --> 30:16.005
Even if I walk away,
Hezbollah will still want you dead.

30:18.020 --> 30:20.770
We just need an address
from you. That's it.

30:22.740 --> 30:25.000
Where were you
taking Sofia Abboud?

30:27.970 --> 30:31.410
Ha. You think I give
a shit about him?

30:32.380 --> 30:34.010
You're here, aren't you?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.870
Why are you here?

30:38.890 --> 30:42.120
For Queen and Country, huh?

30:42.760 --> 30:45.900
The truth is, you're here
for the same reason I am...

30:45.935 --> 30:48.150
our dirty little secret.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.030
This is great fucking fun, eh?

30:51.310 --> 30:55.410
Eh? Try telling that to the
old dear standing next to you

30:55.445 --> 30:57.565
in the queue in the supermarket.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.370
You never feel more fucking
ALIVE than the moment

31:00.405 --> 31:02.550
that you're killing
another human being.

31:02.551 --> 31:03.880
You speak for yourself.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.450
Oh, come on. Come on.
You're a smart lad.

31:06.485 --> 31:09.525
You know you're out here killing for oil,
dollars, and dividends.

31:09.530 --> 31:11.910
It's just easier to
pretend otherwise.

31:11.945 --> 31:14.255
And then... and then
when you've bled out

31:14.290 --> 31:17.015
in some fucking shithole
like this, and you will,

31:17.050 --> 31:19.740
and they don't bother
turning up for your funeral,

31:19.750 --> 31:24.480
they'll just post your
family, if you've got one, a fucking medal.

31:24.930 --> 31:26.720
A fucking medal!

31:28.190 --> 31:29.720
Second class.

31:30.910 --> 31:32.660
They never came back
for you, did they?

31:34.880 --> 31:36.910
That's what all this
is about, isn't it?

31:36.945 --> 31:38.390
Yeah, I understand.

31:38.410 --> 31:41.320
But you're still not gonna
let me kill your boy here.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.735
- James.
- Don't...

31:49.736 --> 31:51.239
Don't whine like a girl.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.669
- Please.
- Be a man.

31:52.675 --> 31:55.427
- Make a choice!
- Shut the fuck up!

31:55.430 --> 31:57.900
- You'd better fucking convince him.
- James, look at me. Don't.

31:57.902 --> 31:58.948
Shut the fuck up!

31:58.950 --> 32:00.715
- James, please.
- Make a choice.

32:00.750 --> 32:03.880
Please, don't let them
do this. James. James!

32:03.915 --> 32:05.550
Don't let them do this!

32:05.650 --> 32:09.140
James. James, look at me, please!

32:35.600 --> 32:36.890
7.

32:39.360 --> 32:40.630
7...

32:42.120 --> 32:45.280
Rue Eville.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.300
Good work.

32:50.330 --> 32:53.825
Zero, did you copy that?
7 Rue Eville. 7 Rue Eville.

32:56.170 --> 32:57.610
Go on. Move.

33:05.930 --> 33:07.930
You fucking traitor.

33:26.950 --> 33:28.110
Fuck.

33:28.140 --> 33:30.350
It's OK. Come with me. Let's go.

33:34.390 --> 33:37.120
I'll see you in hell, soldier.

33:51.100 --> 33:53.010
What the fuck you got there?

33:54.560 --> 33:56.370
- Mikey.
- What the fuck is that?

34:01.940 --> 34:03.660
Zero, this is Bravo Two.

34:03.670 --> 34:05.980
<i>Braveheart and his boyfriend KIA.</i>

34:06.120 --> 34:07.700
We're headed back to you now.

34:07.710 --> 34:10.030
Did you copy that
address, 7 Rue Eville?

34:10.040 --> 34:12.715
Roger. On the road now.

34:12.750 --> 34:16.320
Radio your exfil, and we'll
pick you up en route. Out.

35:10.620 --> 35:12.070
You've done it.

35:13.900 --> 35:15.640
He's here, Rachel.

35:35.580 --> 35:38.885
- Dalton.
- I copy. Where are you, Rachel?

35:38.970 --> 35:40.380
We're at Rue Eville.

35:40.390 --> 35:42.610
Sit tight and observe only.

35:42.870 --> 35:45.240
<i>Stay on open channel.
We're on our way.</i>

35:47.280 --> 35:49.450
Dalton's at Rue Eville. Let's move!

35:49.485 --> 35:50.940
Move!

35:51.090 --> 35:52.860
Get the girl back to the Crib.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.255
Get in the car. Get in the car.

35:54.290 --> 35:57.870
- Mike, Scott, you're with me!
- Go, go. Go, go, go!

36:11.870 --> 36:13.270
Sofia.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.830
You've come a long way.

36:18.860 --> 36:21.385
- Where's my husband?
- He couldn't be here,

36:21.420 --> 36:23.170
but he told me to tell you

36:23.790 --> 36:25.590
he's truly sorry.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.100
I have a shot inside.

37:11.470 --> 37:13.700
Rachel, get out of that house now.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.480
<i>Get out of that house now, Rachel.</i>

37:18.620 --> 37:20.070
Too late.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.150
Shit.

37:37.370 --> 37:38.830
God damm it!

37:55.790 --> 37:57.440
Sorry.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.600
You know my face, do you?

38:47.290 --> 38:50.440
From all those Special
Branch files, right?

38:51.650 --> 38:53.890
What are you, a soldier?

38:54.100 --> 38:56.390
Well, Brit, this
one's for my brother.

38:59.150 --> 39:00.670
Fuck, did you hear that?!

39:10.400 --> 39:11.360
MacKenna.

39:11.970 --> 39:14.010
So here's how it ends.

39:15.850 --> 39:17.470
I'm famous,

39:17.860 --> 39:19.590
and you're done.

39:31.750 --> 39:33.110
Fuck.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.585
- Shit.
- Going right.

39:43.610 --> 39:45.010
She's gone.

39:47.060 --> 39:48.540
I was too late.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.310
Behind that wall!

40:09.290 --> 40:11.750
Whatever Sofia was
carrying, she took it.

40:11.785 --> 40:16.290
- Who?
- Mairead MacKenna. Real IRA.

40:16.310 --> 40:19.655
- What? - What the fuck is the real IRA
doing in the middle of this?

40:19.740 --> 40:22.390
I don't know, but that
was her voice on comms.

40:25.060 --> 40:26.510
She was right.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.500
<i>I love you mommy.</i>

41:52.930 --> 41:54.810
Thank God you're all right!

41:56.870 --> 41:59.600
I'm fine. Are you OK?

41:59.635 --> 42:01.880
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

42:03.900 --> 42:06.540
- I love you.
- I love you, too, Dad.

42:10.150 --> 42:13.070
- We're gonna go.
- Wait. Um,

42:13.300 --> 42:16.080
you'd, um, make an
all right dad, too.

42:16.270 --> 42:17.740
Really?

42:21.560 --> 42:23.520
You're a pretty good kid.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.870
We're done.

42:28.020 --> 42:29.650
It's all good.

42:49.210 --> 42:51.745
What is this? A pebble?

42:51.780 --> 42:54.200
Oh, fuck, it's not a pebble.

42:54.550 --> 42:57.090
That would be one
very expensive pebble.

42:57.125 --> 42:59.690
That is an uncut diamond.

43:00.870 --> 43:02.300
Really?

43:02.335 --> 43:03.730
Really.

43:05.360 --> 43:08.460
- How much?
- It's enough for you to get home,

43:09.480 --> 43:11.190
get out of trouble.

43:13.690 --> 43:16.880
- Why are you doing this for me?
- I don't know.

43:19.210 --> 43:21.770
Probably because you want to get home
and see your family...

43:23.580 --> 43:25.320
fix things.

43:26.260 --> 43:28.320
And if I want
to say "Thank you"?

43:31.030 --> 43:32.090
Well...

43:40.340 --> 43:42.170
begin with this.

43:49.740 --> 43:51.390
That is not a girl's name.

43:51.820 --> 43:53.380
It's my hotel.

44:02.500 --> 44:04.040
Don't eat that.

44:04.470 --> 44:06.160
Not good for you.

44:37.651 --> 44:39.101
Where is he?

44:44.102 --> 44:45.902
Where is he?

44:48.150 --> 44:49.703
Money first.

44:53.370 --> 44:56.200
I'm just thinking, what the fuck do we do
after all this, you know?

44:57.120 --> 44:58.980
Are you talking
about a get-out plan?

44:59.040 --> 45:00.580
Well, I suppose.

45:01.570 --> 45:03.400
Almost died out
there because of her.

45:03.950 --> 45:06.495
Ah, look. No matter
how crazy she was,

45:06.530 --> 45:08.680
I have to believe she did some
things for the right reasons.

45:08.715 --> 45:12.270
- Really, like getting Baxter killed?
- No, no.

45:12.320 --> 45:15.220
She did end up like him, though,
and Leatherby.

45:15.790 --> 45:17.545
- Maybe he was right.
- Huh?

45:17.580 --> 45:19.810
Leatherby. We're all
heading for the same place.

45:19.845 --> 45:22.040
<i>The only thing that changes
is when we get there.</i>

45:23.060 --> 45:25.760
Fuck it. It's not like I got
a great retirement, anyway.

45:26.050 --> 45:29.110
Come on. I don't know about that.

45:31.480 --> 45:32.770
Shit.

45:32.780 --> 45:34.950
Did you hand yours in already?

45:37.580 --> 45:39.350
I'll take that as a no.

45:39.420 --> 45:41.115
Nice work, Sergeant Stonebridge.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.420
Yeah, well, if I did, they
might start asking questions

45:43.430 --> 45:45.370
like, were there any others?

45:45.600 --> 45:47.658
Right, so you just
didn't hand them in to protect me.

45:47.660 --> 45:49.790
Yeah, I'm protecting you, my mate.

45:49.860 --> 45:52.290
Yeah. That makes
me feel much better.

45:52.660 --> 45:54.060
<i>Uh-huh?</i>

45:55.700 --> 45:57.090
Yeah.

45:57.700 --> 46:00.105
- We're on it. Shit.
- What did they say?

46:00.140 --> 46:02.910
They spotted MacKenna on a
CCTV camera at the airport.

46:02.945 --> 46:04.770
She's heading for Budapest.

46:10.621 --> 46:13.621
Next time my friends.
