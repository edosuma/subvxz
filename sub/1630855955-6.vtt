00:01.871 --> 00:02.872
I thought you were just in bed.

00:02.872 --> 00:04.004
Who'’s the bunch of people?

00:06.354 --> 00:08.747
Me and my boyfriend have
been together for four months.

00:08.747 --> 00:11.446
He wants this open relationship
that I'’m so unsure about.

00:15.145 --> 00:16.451
Luka, I do want to kiss him.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.975
But my boyfriend said
I don'’t want

00:18.975 --> 00:19.976
to influence your night off.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.325
Do what you need to do.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.979
I would just hope
that doesn'’t hurt me.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.459
Let me finish.

00:24.459 --> 00:25.677
Stop putting your hand
in my face.

00:25.677 --> 00:27.462
Let me finish.

00:27.462 --> 00:28.767
You'’re going to do this, then
I'’m going to do this to you.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.296
Wow.

00:35.296 --> 00:37.733
I want to trust it, but
I think it'’s the tequila.

00:40.518 --> 00:41.998
If you need to go to the
emergency room, we'’ll do that.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.652
I feel like crap.

00:43.652 --> 00:45.436
We'’re getting you a car
to take you to the hospital.

00:45.436 --> 00:47.308
Now I have a crew member
that'’s sick and down.

00:47.308 --> 00:49.310
At least me and Natalya
are getting along,

00:49.310 --> 00:50.833
because now I need her.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.400
Happy time!

00:52.400 --> 00:54.837
Roy Jr. and Asa Orbison
are thrilled to return

00:54.837 --> 00:57.448
for their third charter
with Captain Sandy.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.929
The guests request a
pizza-making class for the kids.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.496
Last day of charter,

01:01.496 --> 01:03.628
the guests would like the
treasure hunt around the boat.

01:03.628 --> 01:04.412
That would be funny.

01:04.412 --> 01:05.935
You'’ve been smashing it,

01:05.935 --> 01:07.328
so you'’re going to
become the lead deckhand.

01:07.328 --> 01:09.069
- No, you'’re joking.
- Yeah.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.505
Tie it off there properly.

01:10.505 --> 01:13.464
Make a bowline, and
then a hitch or something.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.428
- We'’re not lazy on this boat.
- No, we'’re not lazy.

01:20.428 --> 01:21.820
- What are you doing, bro?
- Stop it.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.039
Don'’t do that.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.519
Lara, you guys can
start hauling.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.086
Thank you.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.698
Calm down, honestly.

01:29.698 --> 01:31.047
I don'’t give a sh--.

01:31.047 --> 01:32.701
Lara, can you relay
what he'’s saying?

01:32.701 --> 01:33.832
The communication sucks.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.530
Hey!

01:35.530 --> 01:36.618
The deck crew'’s communication
has to be clear and concise.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.098
It'’s a----ing safety issue.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.361
You!
Stop arguing.

01:40.361 --> 01:42.580
- Okay, now we'’re good.
- No, you need to move.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.234
- Okay, okay, okay.
- That is not okay.

01:47.150 --> 01:48.369
Radio on one hand,
remote on the other.

01:48.369 --> 01:49.718
- Yeah.
- And talk.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.415
What'’s going on?

01:52.547 --> 01:53.504
Okay.

01:54.940 --> 01:55.941
<i>Long stay.</i>

01:55.941 --> 01:58.466
Sorry, was that
long stay, bro?

01:58.466 --> 01:59.684
<i>You need to hold
the button longer.</i>

01:59.684 --> 02:00.729
Do you want to switch?

02:00.729 --> 02:02.383
You can go, Lara.
You can go.

02:02.383 --> 02:04.211
You need to lay there with
that remote and look over.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.386
- Yeah, I think I should do it.
- And talk to him.

02:05.386 --> 02:06.822
- Yeah.
- Have him move out.

02:06.822 --> 02:07.997
- Okay.
- You lay there.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.085
- Oh, [bleep].
- I'’ll talk.

02:09.085 --> 02:10.695
- Yeah.
- Yay.

02:10.695 --> 02:13.568
Beyond arguing, there'’s a
language barrier with Max,

02:13.568 --> 02:16.005
but I think it'’s also
about how he uses his radio.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.311
And he speaks really fast.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.922
Just slow down a little,
key the mic, then speak.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.358
Luka needs to figure that out.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.317
He'’s never worked as a bosun.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.754
Managing the personalities
is the hard part.

02:25.754 --> 02:27.930
Anchor is up and down,
three o'’clock.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.105
Copy, thank you.

02:29.105 --> 02:31.499
Short stay, three o'’clock.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.022
- Can I clear for you?
- Thank you.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.415
Yes, thank you so much.

02:34.415 --> 02:36.243
Whosever doing the anchor
should have the remote.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.158
- Yeah.
- We can'’t understand.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.073
Anchor is coming up.

02:41.073 --> 02:42.640
Anchor, home.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.598
Copy, thank you.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.382
Coil that please
and put it back.

02:45.382 --> 02:46.992
You can just put it in the gear.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.169
Firstly, give me a hug.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.083
Happy birthday.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.433
Thank you.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.742
We decorate with all cats.

02:57.742 --> 02:59.744
I want it to jus be----ing
cats everywhere.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.834
Aw, honey, don'’t cry.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.059
Where'’d you put the OJ?

03:10.059 --> 03:11.539
Up your ass.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.541
- It'’s that on the side.
- Oh.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.020
Hi.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.327
Chef wants to do the pizza
making for the kids today.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.155
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

03:19.155 --> 03:20.243
Would love to make pizza.

03:20.243 --> 03:22.158
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

03:22.158 --> 03:23.377
So excited.

03:23.377 --> 03:24.943
Enjoy the jetskis.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.902
Put it in neutral.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.120
Come in here.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.297
Turning when you bump.
Turn!

03:30.297 --> 03:32.299
So we can run it up slowly.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.605
This is awesome.
Sandy'’s a great teacher.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.303
I'’m learning so many new skills.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.479
I'’ve grown up driving
cars and motorbikes.

03:38.479 --> 03:39.828
I love that adrenaline rush.

03:39.828 --> 03:41.917
My mum used to rip around
on a sports bike

03:41.917 --> 03:43.440
while she was pregnant with me.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.833
- Put two hands here.
- Mm-hmm.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.356
Push them together.

03:46.356 --> 03:47.575
You know, when you'’re pregnant
and you crave stuff,

03:47.575 --> 03:50.882
her craving was,
like, petrol.

03:50.882 --> 03:53.711
So she'’d like to go past
the gas station and be like...

03:53.711 --> 03:55.278
So I'’m thinking that's
where it came from.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.627
Good job.

03:56.627 --> 03:59.021
Is that your
favorite jetski, Bear?

03:59.021 --> 04:01.023
Are you going to Portofino?

04:01.023 --> 04:03.895
No, no. Don'’t hit the start
button when it'’s on land, okay?

04:12.208 --> 04:15.298
Kyle and I both do
speak Afrikaans.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.865
If I need to get something out,

04:16.865 --> 04:19.171
I'’ll cuss in Afrikaans
because it just feels better.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.564
Like...

04:24.960 --> 04:28.355
That was----ing disgusting
all of this sh-- I just said.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.487
My mum will send me to church.

04:35.536 --> 04:40.280
<i>ETA to destination
is 50 minutes.</i>

04:41.542 --> 04:42.630
I'’m actually better
at making beds,

04:42.630 --> 04:44.458
so I'’m just going to say that.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.242
That is something
I'’m definitely better at.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.200
- Making beds?
- Sorry, yeah.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.593
- This is a competition.
- Yeah.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.247
Kyle, get away from my bed.

04:51.247 --> 04:53.728
- Look at these corners!
- Oh, wow.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.425
You look like you'’re amazing.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.819
- That looks so exciting.
- I prepare and I move on.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.037
Well, where are
you moving on to?

04:59.037 --> 05:00.648
This one.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.867
Natalya and I have such a
brother-sister relationship.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.347
We tease each other,
we love each other,

05:04.347 --> 05:06.523
but Natalya is still
very competitive.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.699
There'’s a constant,
I can do better than you.

05:08.699 --> 05:11.789
This is how you need to do
things, which is very annoying.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.446
Talks and talks and I hear
absolutely nothing.

05:16.446 --> 05:17.795
Guys, we'’ve got a big day.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.101
We'’re going for a
hike or something.

05:19.101 --> 05:21.146
- Something historic.
- Yeah!

05:21.146 --> 05:23.671
Oh, they love the crane.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.977
On the radio, I could only
hear half of what you said.

05:25.977 --> 05:28.066
You need to hold it,
then start talking.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.416
Yeah.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.678
Direction, and then
you'’ve got the stay.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.114
Yeah, the first time
I do English,

05:32.114 --> 05:33.637
I don'’t think it's cool to
come and say

05:33.637 --> 05:36.379
to, you know,
to point at those things that...

05:36.379 --> 05:37.641
Yeah, but the
conversation started

05:37.641 --> 05:38.990
with you asking how much
experience I have.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.644
Yeah.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.429
Trying to patronize me that
I don'’t know what you know.

05:42.429 --> 05:45.170
When people get frustrated and
clash, doesn'’t make it easier.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.782
So, now that we'’ve got the...

05:49.087 --> 05:50.915
Don'’t do that.

05:50.915 --> 05:54.397
Luka'’s calm and he's got
patience with the bloke,

05:54.397 --> 05:55.790
and I don'’t.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.574
I'’ve always been
an angry little child.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.881
Like, my mom even said,
since I was born,

05:59.881 --> 06:02.405
I would get blackouts
where I just get so angry

06:02.405 --> 06:03.972
and----ing
start smashing sh--.

06:03.972 --> 06:06.670
Me and my mom has been alone
since I was three years old,

06:06.670 --> 06:09.630
and she just grafted
to keep us alive.

06:09.630 --> 06:12.981
At one point, we didn'’t have
a house we lived in.

06:12.981 --> 06:17.377
I had to go live with my aunt,
but it taught me to not be lazy

06:17.377 --> 06:19.161
and to work towards
something that you want,

06:19.161 --> 06:22.033
because I never want to be
in that situation again.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.165
We'’ll work it out.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.646
Okay, so the deal is...

06:25.646 --> 06:29.214
11 o'’clock, the kids
do pizza with you.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.607
12 o'’clock lunch.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.043
Can I just let Natalya
know that as well,

06:32.043 --> 06:33.784
because she'’s going to
be doing it with me.

06:33.784 --> 06:34.698
Okay.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.483
- What'’s up?
- Excuse me.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.746
Please don'’t touch me. In the
work place, it'’s inappropriate.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.712
- Where you going?
- Work.

06:48.712 --> 06:50.714
- I'’m gonna start oiling up.
- Yeah, do it.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.064
Oh, my God.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.246
Pressuring me about Luka in,
like, having a free-for-all

07:01.246 --> 07:02.639
where you get to go to Thailand.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.511
It'’s like, what is
he doing over there?

07:04.511 --> 07:06.077
There'’s definitely
double-standard bullsh--

07:06.077 --> 07:08.297
happening right now.

07:08.297 --> 07:10.865
I get annoyed, so I just wanted
to sit down for a bit.

07:10.865 --> 07:14.695
Yeah, and I hated when guys be,
like, all macho and, you know...

07:14.695 --> 07:15.957
Yeah.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.262
I have this list of,
like, everything I hate.

07:17.262 --> 07:18.394
What else do you hate?

07:18.394 --> 07:20.135
I hate sunglasses indoors.

07:20.135 --> 07:21.528
I'’m scared of ant eaters.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.572
They just don'’t
make sense to me.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.052
They look prehistoric.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.663
Their nose is probably that big,
and only eat ants.

07:26.663 --> 07:28.796
Female'’s pants. Why do we
have pockets

07:28.796 --> 07:30.232
that don'’t
make----ing sense?

07:30.232 --> 07:31.538
Yeah.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.192
Let'’s go back to work.

07:34.192 --> 07:35.803
Natalya.
Pizza party.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.065
Pizza party.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.153
You are going to do
with the chef is at 11?

07:38.153 --> 07:40.068
- Okay.
- Cool.

07:40.068 --> 07:42.070
Haleigh and Lara. Are you
two going to drop the anchor?

07:42.070 --> 07:44.289
Copy.
We'’re on the bow already.

07:44.289 --> 07:45.682
Drop the anchor.
Drop the anchor.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.860
That is five shackles
in the water.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.862
Okay, great.
Lock it down. We'’re good.

07:51.862 --> 07:54.082
Good job. Let'’s start
putting sh-- in the water.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.607
We'’re all clear.
We will do the slide.

08:00.741 --> 08:03.004
Okay, let'’s go, guys.
This way, this way.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.571
So, where are we now?
Do you know?

08:04.571 --> 08:06.573
Cinque Terre.
It'’s the five towns,

08:06.573 --> 08:08.879
and you can'’t get to
them except with a boat.

08:08.879 --> 08:11.534
- Ready to make pizza?
- Ready to make some pizza?

08:11.534 --> 08:12.927
- Yeah.
- Mama mia.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.755
We'’re going to take
the carabiner off.

08:14.755 --> 08:16.452
I want to try and
fit them in this gap.

08:16.452 --> 08:19.150
Okay, boys, remember
to listen to Chef.

08:19.150 --> 08:20.282
- He'’s the boss.
- Yeah.

08:20.282 --> 08:21.588
Okay?

08:21.588 --> 08:22.806
When I lived in Vietnam,
as well as being a chef,

08:22.806 --> 08:24.286
I was an English teacher
for kids.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.941
They were three years old. I was
basically a babysitter.

08:26.941 --> 08:28.638
So, that'’s the approach I take.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.771
So, just stretch it.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.947
Chef'’s got a hole
in his pizza. I don'’t.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.127
Yours is strange.
Mine'’s cool.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.608
Yeah, that'’s it.
Just slap it.

08:43.305 --> 08:44.567
- Hi.
- My feet is killing me.

08:44.567 --> 08:45.960
I know.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.179
You know, I club a whole day
in six-inch heels.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.138
It doesn'’t hurt as much
as I do service.

08:50.138 --> 08:52.009
So swollen.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.620
- Did you sleep well last night?
- Yeah.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.056
I didn'’t wake up
during the night.

08:58.189 --> 08:59.495
Ooh.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.628
My boyfriend'’s literally
just gone out.

09:01.628 --> 09:04.674
This open relationship,
it'’s all bullsh--.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.371
You know, on the other day, he
said he wants my babies,

09:06.371 --> 09:08.591
and that made me very turned on.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.550
I think I'’m finally
becoming a woman.

09:10.550 --> 09:15.555
Natalya.
Go to----ing bed.

09:20.037 --> 09:22.866
but if he'’s talking
sh-- about her,

09:22.866 --> 09:25.434
he'’s definitely talking
sh-- about me.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.044
Like, that'’s not a friend.

09:27.044 --> 09:29.481
I don'’t know what's going on,
but whatever it is,

09:29.481 --> 09:30.613
it'’s not genuine.

09:31.527 --> 09:32.833
It'’s your bestie.

09:32.833 --> 09:35.183
So just get your tomato sauce.

09:37.620 --> 09:38.752
You had to spread all over.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.754
Wow.
Look at those skills on you.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.190
Right.
This is the topping time.

09:42.190 --> 09:44.627
Whatever we want to put on,
we put on.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.150
Okay, guys.
Mine'’s done.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.761
- That looks awful.
- Awfully delicious.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.501
Okay.
We'’re ready to go in the oven.

09:49.501 --> 09:52.069
All right. We'’ll go pour flour
on one of the boys on the back.

09:53.462 --> 09:54.506
Okay, follow me.

09:54.506 --> 09:55.812
Let'’s pour it on the heads.

09:55.812 --> 09:58.119
I need to sit down
for like four seconds.

09:58.119 --> 09:59.860
Have you ever done this?

09:59.860 --> 10:01.383
I'’ve never done this before.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.950
Let me first check up on them.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.039
Yeah. Check on them.
I'’m going to wash these.

10:05.039 --> 10:06.997
Pizza chef'’s coming through.

10:06.997 --> 10:08.216
Whoa!

10:08.216 --> 10:09.478
What'’s the [bleep]?

10:09.478 --> 10:11.175
Those little crotch
goblins running around.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.568
Whoa!

10:12.568 --> 10:14.178
Why do you want that
on your head?

10:14.178 --> 10:15.658
- Oh, my gosh.
- You wanted it on my head!

10:15.658 --> 10:17.442
Do you know how
to work the crane?

10:17.442 --> 10:18.792
Yeah.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.881
Can you turn it on and
just say cable out?

10:20.881 --> 10:22.578
- Okay.
- A little bit.

10:22.578 --> 10:24.362
Please.

10:29.498 --> 10:31.892
Ooh! Looks good.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.328
Cable out.
Cable out.

10:33.328 --> 10:34.634
Yeah.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.505
- Cable out!
- Yeah, I know. Wait, wait.

10:36.505 --> 10:38.072
I need to figure.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.421
It'’s not right on the picture,
so I'’m figuring.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.553
It says cable out.
I don'’t understand.

10:41.553 --> 10:44.731
It doesn'’t matter what
the title of Lara is.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.471
I don'’t think Lara respects me.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.430
I feel it.
I see it.

10:48.430 --> 10:49.736
I don'’t care.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.738
Cable out. Yeah.

10:51.738 --> 10:55.393
No. Cable out.
Cable out!

10:55.393 --> 10:56.394
Huh?

10:56.394 --> 10:58.092
Coming up...

10:58.092 --> 11:00.311
Luka...

11:03.663 --> 11:05.752
This is not going to be good.

11:09.190 --> 11:11.192
Cable out, cable out.

11:11.192 --> 11:12.846
- Cable out, not in.
- Yeah, I know. Wait, wait.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.412
I need to figure.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.066
It'’s not right on the picture,
so I'’m figuring.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.678
It says cable out.
I don'’t understand.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.071
- Cable out, yeah.
- No.

11:26.947 --> 11:27.948
Okay, stop.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.776
Just a little bit up.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.695
Exorcist.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.739
Yeah, that'’s good.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.219
Thanks.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.657
You know, if I were you
guys on my day off here,

11:41.657 --> 11:43.006
I would just lay on that couch.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.007
- I'’ve seen you do it.
- Please.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.356
Like, you will...

11:45.356 --> 11:46.793
You know, I actually
haven'’t seen you

11:46.793 --> 11:47.924
half of the time
you were in here.

11:47.924 --> 11:49.839
Kyle lounging again.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.449
Oh!

11:51.449 --> 11:52.799
It'’s the most comfortable
couch I'’ve ever sat on.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.191
Dude!

11:54.191 --> 11:56.454
You'’re giving me triggers
of last season.

11:57.804 --> 11:58.935
Don'’t worry about it.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.458
Kyle, while you'’re
enjoying coffee,

12:00.458 --> 12:02.460
I'’ve vacuumed the bridge,
the day heads,

12:02.460 --> 12:04.375
the bridge deck salon,
all the way down and wiped.

12:04.375 --> 12:07.378
I still get, like, a little
triggered by laziness.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.945
Oh, my gosh.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.382
My parents were
go, go, go, go.

12:11.382 --> 12:14.037
In my childhood, my house
was, like, immaculate.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.865
Dad handled the outside
and mum was inside.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.301
So it'’s like a yacht.

12:17.301 --> 12:18.607
There'’s the exterior
and the interior crew.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.218
I loved it.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.481
Your daughter can come
around anytime she wants.

12:23.481 --> 12:25.614
She just cleans our house.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.225
Whoa!
It'’s over here.

12:28.225 --> 12:29.531
- That'’s mine.
- Yours is over here, man.

12:29.531 --> 12:30.575
Wow.

12:30.575 --> 12:31.925
Oh, man.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.665
Maybe you should go
in a break or something.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.624
I don'’t think I'll really
be taking breaks this trip.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.582
- Yeah.
- Enjoy your pizza.

12:37.582 --> 12:38.975
Come up the stairs.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.368
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.239
All right.
Daddy'’s going to try it.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.327
Daddy'’s going to hit it.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.373
You made a spicy
piece for Daddy?

12:45.373 --> 12:46.548
Mmm.

12:46.548 --> 12:47.854
These are great pizzas, guys.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.986
Yeah.

12:51.205 --> 12:54.338
The theme of the day
is pirates. Arrr...

12:54.338 --> 12:56.340
You need to figure out
a treasure hunt game.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.342
Oh, that'’s easy.
I'’ve done 1,000 of them.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.343
Perfect.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.041
All right.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.172
Cheffy, the guests are
sitting at the table.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.347
So if you'’re ready to get going.

13:03.347 --> 13:05.219
All right.
I'’ll start.

13:05.219 --> 13:07.612
Dude, this little kid made some
of the best pizza I'’ve ever had.

13:07.612 --> 13:10.702
The guests want Italian food,
which is great.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.182
I'’m good at cooking it, and

13:12.182 --> 13:13.270
it'’s probably
my favorite to eat.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.489
It'’s all about flavor.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.012
Like, you could actually
be a vegetarian,

13:16.012 --> 13:18.623
and eat Italian food,
and you wouldn'’t be unhappy.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.103
Just really fat.

13:21.757 --> 13:22.845
Classic Italian flavors.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.760
Marinated burrata.

13:24.760 --> 13:25.848
That'’s my favorite.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.110
Poached lobster.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.155
Well, this is good together.

13:28.155 --> 13:29.504
You need this together.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.027
Penne arrabiata.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.160
This is the best thing
we'’ve had for the whole trip.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.726
We'’ll start putting
stuff in the water.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.859
Why don'’t we take them
ashore for their excursion?

13:36.859 --> 13:37.947
- A tender run?
- Yeah.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.470
Max, Max, Luka.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.213
Max, Max, Luka.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.736
Looking after Max is
like having a toddler.

13:44.736 --> 13:46.651
You'’ve got to guide him
to where he needs to go.

13:46.651 --> 13:49.437
You'’ve got to explain exactly
how something has to be done.

13:49.437 --> 13:52.396
And if he'’s not happy,
he'’ll be throwing a tantrum.

13:52.396 --> 13:53.571
<i>Max, Max, Luka.</i>

13:53.571 --> 13:55.225
Yeah, Luka, go ahead.

13:55.225 --> 13:56.923
<i>Can you please help Haleigh
on the swim platform.</i>

13:56.923 --> 13:58.185
Good news is
he'’s potty trained,

13:58.185 --> 13:59.577
so I don'’t have
to teach him that.

13:59.577 --> 14:02.232
Yeah, I'’m with her.
I'’m with her.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.712
Good.

14:03.712 --> 14:04.756
I mean, you think how
interesting can it be, penne?

14:04.756 --> 14:06.410
It'’s amazing.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.629
We'’ve got to eat all of this
and jump off of the boat.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.588
- Like, this could be...
- Roy?

14:10.588 --> 14:11.589
Yeah.

14:11.589 --> 14:12.982
Asa, have you tried this?

14:12.982 --> 14:15.767
- Yeah, because...
- It could have been like a...

14:15.767 --> 14:17.378
Waa!
Which is what I wanted.

14:17.378 --> 14:19.075
- Don'’t come with that.
- Just let'’s have a laugh.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.424
I love chaos.

14:20.424 --> 14:24.602
If I sit still, it just
destabilizes everything.

14:24.602 --> 14:25.995
I got it from my mama.

14:25.995 --> 14:28.563
I need to go, go, go, go, go,
or not go at all.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.173
When we were younger,

14:30.173 --> 14:31.174
like, we had to get out of
bed before 10 o'’clock

14:31.174 --> 14:32.915
or whatever time it was.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.656
Even now, if 10 o'’clock hits
and I'’m still in pajamas,

14:34.656 --> 14:37.267
like, your day'’s ruined.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.791
After lunch, you'’re going
to a historical landmark.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.750
It is a little bit of a hike up.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.969
Just wear comfortable shoes.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.927
Thank you, Tumi.
It was delicious.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.624
- Pass it on to Jack.
- I will.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.061
Stop making me fat.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.410
Natalya, Natalya, Tumi.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.107
Could you come to
the crew mess quickly?

14:51.107 --> 14:53.196
I just want to know what'’s
happening with this shore run.

14:53.196 --> 14:54.894
We do need one deck.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.200
I'’ll send Haleigh.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.942
- Yes, you are.
- Yay!

14:59.942 --> 15:00.987
You'’re going to enjoy it, Naty.

15:00.987 --> 15:01.988
I don'’t like hiking.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.467
ing living hell.

15:03.467 --> 15:04.860
I do not hike.
It'’s not an enjoyable thing.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.166
I'’m like, oh, let's go for it.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.646
Like, who actually likes
walking up a cliff?

15:08.646 --> 15:10.605
Who likes it?
No one.

15:10.605 --> 15:11.954
Have fun.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.260
And then when I get back,
I'’ll just sit down

15:13.260 --> 15:14.957
- and write those clues.
- Perfect.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.960
Haleigh, you'’re going to go
on the excursion with Natalya.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.223
You'’re doing like a hike.

15:20.223 --> 15:22.965
Who'’s ready to blow this
popsicle stick?

15:22.965 --> 15:24.924
Hello, everyone.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.795
One, two, three.

15:26.795 --> 15:27.970
I'’m cooking!

15:27.970 --> 15:29.319
Sh--.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.234
- Everyone all good?
- Woo!

15:31.234 --> 15:33.323
Ready to hike.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.456
Laundry'’s done.

15:35.456 --> 15:36.805
Dinner at 6 p.m.

15:36.805 --> 15:39.286
Okay, that'’s for us.
I'’m going to set up,

15:39.286 --> 15:41.636
and you'’re going
to go on your break.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.943
- No one on the stern?
- No one on the stern.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.248
Luka didn'’t tell me to...

15:45.248 --> 15:46.989
Okay, but listen.
Look at me.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.730
We never leave the stern alone.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.514
- Okay, I'’m going back there.
- I'’m going back there.

15:50.514 --> 15:51.994
- You wait for one of us.
- I'’m going back there.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.735
No, you take
an hour break now.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.432
Can you stand here?

15:55.432 --> 15:57.043
Fancy driving there.
That'’s great work.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.087
Cheers, man.

15:58.087 --> 15:59.306
Everyone say bye.

15:59.306 --> 16:00.829
See ya.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.091
Okay, guys, we'’re going to go
to the monument first.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.701
Ooh!

16:03.701 --> 16:05.268
Skip and hop.

16:05.268 --> 16:06.530
- We tying up?
- Yeah.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.358
You just know exactly
what I want.

16:08.358 --> 16:09.577
Love you.
If you need me wake me up.

16:09.577 --> 16:10.665
Bye-bye.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.232
- I just told Max to go down.
- Yeah.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.060
I'’ll have a word to him
when he gets back.

16:14.060 --> 16:17.280
I know, it'’s irritating.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.847
Maybe we could feed
the guy compliments.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.022
Right.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.155
A little system
for this sh--.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.374
Let'’s just try.

16:24.374 --> 16:26.072
One thing I'’ve noticed
about Max

16:26.072 --> 16:29.031
is he doesn'’t like
being told off.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.467
Maybe we'’ll try
the opposite of that.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.209
I don'’t know.

16:33.209 --> 16:34.689
I'’m going to finish
the bridge deck aft.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.083
- I'’m just vacuuming things.
- Sweet.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.608
Max, Max, could you
meet me up on the bow?

16:45.047 --> 16:46.918
We made it. Paradise.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.572
- Wow.
- San Francisco.

16:48.572 --> 16:51.488
This San Francisco is way nicer
than the San Francisco we know.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.882
All I know is we'’re in this
beautiful town of Monterosso.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.232
We'’re at the statue of
St. Francis and his dog.

16:56.232 --> 16:59.061
- Dee-a... d'’Assisi.
- d'’Assisi.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.194
- Would you like some waters?
- No.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.327
Maybe him and his dog
could help me

17:04.327 --> 17:07.113
figure out what'’s happening
in my love life.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.680
Beautiful.
Say cheese.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.421
You know how to
remember the colors?

17:11.421 --> 17:13.119
Yes, it'’s like...

17:13.119 --> 17:14.946
Rub your balls.

17:14.946 --> 17:15.947
Balls?

17:15.947 --> 17:16.948
Yeah.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.602
With grease.

17:20.778 --> 17:21.605
Okay.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.825
Red, yellow, blue and white.

17:26.567 --> 17:27.872
Oh, it'’s a beautiful view.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.571
Is our boat
that one all the way over there?

17:30.571 --> 17:32.355
No, we'’re right up
around the corner.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.140
When you guys want to leave,
I'’ll call the boat.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.967
I think we'’re ready.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.622
- Hey, Tumi.
<i>- Hi.</i>

17:38.622 --> 17:41.364
Would you mind sending
the tender now, please?

17:41.364 --> 17:42.626
<i>- I'’ll send it through.</i>
- Thank you.

17:42.626 --> 17:45.586
<i>- Luka, Natalya'’s ready.
- Okay.</i>

17:45.586 --> 17:48.763
Tender'’s on its way.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.852
It was nice to get out.
I needed to, like...

17:50.852 --> 17:52.071
I needed some fresh air.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.769
- Cheffy, dinner at 6 p.m.
- Yeah.

17:54.769 --> 17:55.944
Oh, that looks so nummy.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.163
Salt baked sea bream.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.860
Good.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.601
So, everything on the table at
once, do you think, or just...

18:00.601 --> 18:01.471
Yeah.

18:01.471 --> 18:02.603
Let'’s all wave.
Bye-bye.

18:02.603 --> 18:05.345
- Bye-bye.
- Arrivaderci.

18:05.345 --> 18:08.391
All crew, all crew.
Tender returning.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.524
Copy that.
Standing by on the stern.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.003
Woo!

18:12.003 --> 18:13.396
Rollercoaster.

18:13.396 --> 18:14.876
Thank you.
Thank you.

18:14.876 --> 18:17.444
All that walking worked up
an appetite.

18:18.532 --> 18:19.881
Oh. Yes!

18:21.404 --> 18:22.797
- Dinner'’s going to be 6 p.m.
- That'’s great.

18:22.797 --> 18:23.928
Perfect.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.147
You guys want some
grapefruit sauce?

18:25.147 --> 18:26.148
- We do.
- It'’s non-alcoholic.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.323
And this is for the kids.

18:27.323 --> 18:28.324
Thank you.
This is what we needed.

18:28.324 --> 18:29.456
Of course.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.371
It'’s the greatest vacation ever.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.723
Nat, can we get plates?

18:36.898 --> 18:38.508
Um, the gold ones.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.380
- Wendy'’s winning.
- Oh, my God.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.947
Max, you'’re doing
- ing great.

18:42.947 --> 18:44.035
Thank you, Lara.

18:44.035 --> 18:45.907
There we go.
Some positivity.

18:45.907 --> 18:46.908
You'’re doing amazing.

18:46.908 --> 18:48.039
Ooh.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.476
- Cheffy, chef, chef.
- Yes.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.042
She just asked me to
put plates on the table.

18:51.042 --> 18:52.218
Is it buffet tonight again?

18:52.218 --> 18:53.654
Yeah, so I'’m doing a platter.

18:53.654 --> 18:54.872
So the platters
on the middle table?

18:54.872 --> 18:56.004
Yes.

19:03.664 --> 19:05.187
I feel like my
relationship is now

19:05.187 --> 19:07.711
definitely affecting
my work life.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.496
It'’s just adding
so much more anxiety

19:09.496 --> 19:10.932
and stress onto me.

19:10.932 --> 19:12.412
I like to tell people the sh--
I'’m dealing with

19:12.412 --> 19:14.718
because I just vent
and I vent loud.

19:14.718 --> 19:17.156
This reset definitely needed
to happen with Tumi.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.898
It'’s a small step I take
to not go towards violence.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.250
Coming up...

19:24.250 --> 19:27.427
"Pirate'’s flag, secure the bag
to receive the clue."

19:27.427 --> 19:29.211
You have to get
Captain Sharkbite!

19:29.211 --> 19:30.386
Oh, oh, oh.

19:30.386 --> 19:31.692
Okay, that'’s enough!

19:31.692 --> 19:34.738
Arrrre we gonna have some
fun today, kids?

19:37.654 --> 19:38.655
Oh, God.

19:44.748 --> 19:47.882
It'’s like pure love.

19:47.882 --> 19:49.449
We'’re going to go
for a boat ride.

19:49.449 --> 19:50.754
We'’re going to drive
to Porto Venere.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.582
It'’s like an hour and 15.

19:52.582 --> 19:53.670
That'’s perfect.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.455
Lara and Luka to the bridge.

19:55.455 --> 19:56.673
- Copy.
- On my way.

19:56.673 --> 19:57.979
Are we eating at 6 or 6:30?

19:57.979 --> 19:59.459
I don'’t know.
Let'’s say 6:30.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.025
- 6:30?
- That'’s good for the crew, too.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.766
- That sounds great.
- Let'’s give them some time.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.160
- 6:30.
- Thank you.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.683
Hello.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.381
I'’m going to let this young
lady haul the anchor,

20:08.381 --> 20:10.513
and then when we get
to Porto Venere,

20:10.513 --> 20:11.819
you can do the drop.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.168
Just watch, and I call him.

20:13.168 --> 20:15.170
Do you want to do
the wing like he did?

20:15.170 --> 20:16.476
No, you'’re driving.

20:16.476 --> 20:17.912
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'’m driving?

20:17.912 --> 20:18.695
Yeah.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.654
I was like, whoa.

20:20.654 --> 20:23.178
Like that'’s the nicest thing

20:23.178 --> 20:25.267
that I'’ve heard out of
a captain'’s mouth.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.356
Give her the wing station
so she could have a visual.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.792
Sweet.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.273
Every time I see Lara,
she works really hard.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.188
- Good job.
- Grazie mille.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.711
And she cares.

20:34.711 --> 20:37.323
I want her to see just how
important communication is.

20:37.323 --> 20:40.195
Because when you'’re at
the helm, you'’re not watching.

20:40.195 --> 20:41.718
You'’re maneuvering.

20:41.718 --> 20:44.591
Dinner'’s pushed to 6:30 now.
Is that good for you?

20:44.591 --> 20:46.549
- Yes.
- Tumi, Tumi, Nat.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.335
Hi, I'’m just letting you know.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.945
I just spoke with the guests

20:50.945 --> 20:52.512
And they'’re wanting to sit down
at 6:30 for dinner.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.557
- Copy, thank you.
- Pleasure.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.432
Open this.
Go to your wing station.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.303
I'’m going to lift, call,

21:01.303 --> 21:03.349
and you'’re just going
to keep an eye on it.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.480
I have two eyes if you want.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.221
- Yeah.
- Take command here.

21:06.221 --> 21:07.788
Tell them haul anchor.

21:07.788 --> 21:10.138
Okay, boys. You can start
hauling the anchor, please.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.574
<i>Copy that.</i>

21:13.315 --> 21:15.839
You got to give it a few
seconds to kick in gear.

21:15.839 --> 21:17.537
Lara, two shackles on deck.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.539
Copy that. Thank you.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.062
My dream job is to be a captain.

21:21.062 --> 21:23.978
I even get shivers
now when I...

21:27.938 --> 21:29.462
No captain has ever
let me do this.

21:29.462 --> 21:31.072
I'’ll never forget it.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.726
I can remember even
when I was young.

21:32.726 --> 21:35.076
I had a vision of myself
being the captain of a boat

21:35.076 --> 21:36.860
with a little monkey
on my shoulder.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.340
Like Captain Hook.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.602
The little----ing monkey.

21:39.602 --> 21:41.300
Come into the bridge,
to the wheel.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.344
Yeah.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.824
I just, it means
the world to me.

21:43.824 --> 21:47.131
- The anchor is home.
- Thank you, boys. Good job.

21:47.131 --> 21:48.611
Good job.

21:50.178 --> 21:51.353
Okay.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.573
Now go into gear and
then make a turn.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.444
- Oh, this wheel.
- Yeah.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.794
So you'’re telling it to go two
degrees and that'’s your angle.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.666
Oh, I understand.

21:59.666 --> 22:02.495
That'’s good.
That'’s a good turn.

22:02.495 --> 22:06.150
Now go back to center.

22:06.150 --> 22:07.761
- Excellent work.
- Hell yeah.

22:07.761 --> 22:09.415
Thank you, brother.

22:09.415 --> 22:12.635
I was honestly a bit stressed,
but oh, what an experience.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.115
I think she'’d make
a great captain.

22:14.115 --> 22:17.814
She'’s like a little
Sandy back in the day.

22:17.814 --> 22:19.294
Captain, let'’s do
this again soon.

22:19.294 --> 22:20.991
Okay.

22:22.079 --> 22:23.733
Does it look Italian
to you, though?

22:23.733 --> 22:24.995
I feel like I'’m in
Italy right now.

22:24.995 --> 22:25.779
Yes.

22:25.779 --> 22:26.997
All crew, all crew.

22:26.997 --> 22:29.348
ETA to destination
is 50 minutes.

22:31.654 --> 22:32.960
- You know arancini?
- Oh.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.353
- Now go listen.
- Huh?

22:38.400 --> 22:40.881
As soon as you roll out service,
I'’ll run down to housekeeping.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.714
Oh, my God.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.023
Come on, boys.
Come on, everybody.

22:53.023 --> 22:54.460
- Flat bread.
- Take that.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.852
Salt crusted bream.

22:55.852 --> 22:56.853
It looks gorgeous, by the way.

22:56.853 --> 22:57.941
All that'’s ready to go.

22:57.941 --> 22:59.247
And there'’s just one more plate,

22:59.247 --> 23:00.509
which will be ready
when you get back.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.076
Just one more. Okay.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.077
Yeah, we'’re moving.
We'’re moving, dude.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.295
- Okay, that can go.
- Gotcha.

23:04.295 --> 23:05.775
Got your mozzarella.

23:05.775 --> 23:07.473
You'’ve done beautiful
decorations here.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.909
This is the risotto.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.127
Guys, look how beautiful
this is.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.259
Oh, so good.

23:11.259 --> 23:12.739
I like eating
while we'’re moving.

23:12.739 --> 23:15.002
- It'’s like music.
- Oh, my God.

23:15.002 --> 23:16.612
That'’s the beam, right?
Sea beam?

23:16.612 --> 23:18.527
- Bream.
- Bream.

23:18.527 --> 23:20.355
Kyle.
To the rescue.

23:20.355 --> 23:22.531
Woo, woo.
I'’m doing the dishes.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.011
Woo, woo.

23:24.011 --> 23:26.448
Lara'’s back
in the party.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.493
Yes, brother.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.756
Good job, Maxi-pad.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.497
I'’m a strong independent woman.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.455
It'’s like a light switch
went off,----ing hell.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.326
Here we go.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.981
Now I know how to----ing
deal with your ass.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.374
You'’re doing amazing.

23:39.374 --> 23:41.637
I have special skills in life,
you know?

23:41.637 --> 23:44.074
He'’s completely
from outer space.

23:52.518 --> 23:53.910
I don'’t understand
how that'’s possible

23:53.910 --> 23:56.696
because everything
was down to the t.

23:56.696 --> 23:59.133
I feel Natalya'’s
been very stable

23:59.133 --> 24:01.135
since the reset on the interior.

24:01.135 --> 24:02.789
But she'’s not above regression.

24:02.789 --> 24:04.486
No guests are complaining,

24:04.486 --> 24:07.184
but she'’s convincing herself
that there is something wrong

24:07.184 --> 24:08.708
when no one else
can see anything.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.710
The drama, girl.
The drama.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.320
I heard you.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.843
All crew, all crew.

24:13.843 --> 24:15.758
We'’ll be arriving at our
destination in six minutes.

24:15.758 --> 24:17.281
- Ah!
- Ooh.

24:17.281 --> 24:19.458
- Can I grab this quick?
- Yeah.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.155
Come on, boys.
It'’s time for us to go to bed.

24:21.155 --> 24:22.722
Okay, I'’m going to try to move.

24:22.722 --> 24:23.940
Drop the anchor.

24:27.248 --> 24:28.728
<i>Bridge, that is one shackle.</i>

24:28.728 --> 24:30.251
Great.
Lock it down.

24:30.251 --> 24:31.121
What a good day.

24:31.121 --> 24:32.558
Okay, I'’ll be downstairs.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.473
Party planning to do.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.084
Okay.

24:37.084 --> 24:39.347
If you'’ve ever looked
like a lesbian, it'’s now.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.219
Okay, who'’s ready for
the rules of Bones?

24:42.219 --> 24:44.091
Everybody knows how
to play except her,

24:44.091 --> 24:47.094
- so she makes up the rules.
- It'’s not true.

24:47.094 --> 24:48.399
Seem to be doing
all right without Jess.

24:48.399 --> 24:49.618
Is Jess coming back?

24:49.618 --> 24:51.315
I don'’t know.
I'’ve not heard from her.

24:51.315 --> 24:53.317
Is it because you want to shove
your tongue down her throat?

24:53.317 --> 24:54.580
I don'’t.
I'’m married.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.277
Married to the life of...

24:56.277 --> 24:58.453
Yeah, hopefully she comes back.
She was cute.

25:02.152 --> 25:03.327
- Yeah.
- One...

25:03.327 --> 25:04.633
What, we'’re----ing
playing Yahtzee?

25:04.633 --> 25:06.069
And five...

25:06.069 --> 25:07.593
It sounded so much cooler
when it was Bones.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.072
Find the cook with the hook

25:09.072 --> 25:10.683
to receive the book
to take a look.

25:10.683 --> 25:11.684
The final clue.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.294
Lara, you'’ve got all...

25:13.294 --> 25:14.861
Tomorrow I'’ll tell you
what your jobs are on here.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.297
Everyone in the morning,
you have to be dressed

25:16.297 --> 25:17.994
in your pirate outfits
as soon as you wake up

25:17.994 --> 25:19.909
because they'’re going to
have the clues in three...

25:19.909 --> 25:21.389
What the [bleep] is that noise?

25:21.389 --> 25:24.131
"I float in the ocean
and I go under sea.

25:24.131 --> 25:26.394
You will find me floating
in the jacuzzi."

25:26.394 --> 25:29.136
- What is it?
- A piece of sh--.

25:29.136 --> 25:30.616
It'’s a----ing submarine.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.226
See, these envelopes are
going to be around the boat.

25:32.226 --> 25:34.402
- That'’s amazing.
- I made this.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.839
- No, no.
- Ah!

25:40.843 --> 25:42.584
Mmm, bedtime.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.282
It'’s so early. You picking up
what I'’m putting down?

25:45.282 --> 25:46.457
Yeah.

25:46.457 --> 25:47.981
Good night.

25:47.981 --> 25:49.635
I hate to just, like, win a
couple times and leave it.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.637
but Erica'’s leaving.

25:51.637 --> 25:52.899
Hold on, Kyle.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.161
Wait, you taking it up up?

25:54.161 --> 25:55.379
I'’m going to put it
behind the bar.

25:55.379 --> 25:57.468
- Good night, guys.
- Night, night.

25:57.468 --> 26:00.210
Gosh, just leaning on
my fat roll.

26:00.210 --> 26:01.603
So what'’s happening tomorrow?

26:01.603 --> 26:02.996
I'’ll make sure everyone
knows their little role.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.171
The deck crew will blow
up balloons.

26:04.171 --> 26:05.694
Wake up at, like, six.

26:05.694 --> 26:07.522
I'’ll just get it all looking
like a ship out there.

26:07.522 --> 26:09.437
I'’ll come help you.
It'’s going to be so cute.

26:09.437 --> 26:10.656
Guys, we'’re going to have to
wake up looking like pirates.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.266
I love it.

26:12.266 --> 26:14.355
I feel like Natalya'’s attitude
has completely changed.

26:14.355 --> 26:16.009
Most likely we'’ll
never be best friends.

26:16.009 --> 26:18.272
But if I had met Natalya
this charter,

26:18.272 --> 26:19.882
maybe things would have
been a bit different

26:19.882 --> 26:21.362
from what it has been.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.799
Unfortunately,
I saw the demon first.

26:23.799 --> 26:25.540
Stop putting your hand
in my face.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.542
If you'’re going to do this, then
I'’m going to do this to you.

26:28.717 --> 26:30.066
God damn it.

26:30.066 --> 26:31.459
All right, guys,
all the machines are on

26:31.459 --> 26:32.982
and there'’s nothing
to turn over.

26:32.982 --> 26:35.898
Daddy loves you.

26:37.857 --> 26:39.685
All right.
Night night.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.164
Okay, good night.

26:44.037 --> 26:45.908
I need, like, a hair extension
or something.

26:48.737 --> 26:49.825
Okay.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.740
- This is you.
- This is me.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.873
You'’re crazy.

26:53.873 --> 26:54.874
You lost the plot.

26:54.874 --> 26:56.005
Do you want it or not?

26:56.005 --> 26:57.398
Yeah, sure.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.008
Okay, now who'’s the
- ing crazy one

26:59.008 --> 27:00.793
for accepting it?
I was joking.

27:00.793 --> 27:02.708
Like, what do you want, girl?

27:02.708 --> 27:04.318
Is it on or is it off?

27:04.318 --> 27:05.754
Weirdo.

27:05.754 --> 27:07.800
To be honest, I'’ve got
some feelings for Natalya.

27:07.800 --> 27:08.888
She'’s definitely my type.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.411
Smell, I put my perfume on it.

27:10.411 --> 27:11.760
Did you?

27:11.760 --> 27:14.241
But it'’s starting to get
a little bit harder.

27:14.241 --> 27:18.158
Who am I to Natalya?
A side piece?

27:24.033 --> 27:25.513
Coming up...

27:25.513 --> 27:27.036
We'’re going in between
these two right here.

27:27.036 --> 27:28.429
We'’re going in
a pretty tight spot.

27:28.429 --> 27:30.344
The gap looks----ing
smaller than the boat.

27:30.344 --> 27:33.956
I don'’t know how Sandy trusts me
to----ing call this thing in.

27:38.613 --> 27:39.788
Arr!

27:42.269 --> 27:43.879
Ahoy, mateys!

27:43.879 --> 27:46.186
Come on, we must
find the pearls.

27:46.186 --> 27:49.537
Arrrre we'’re going
to have some fun today?

27:49.537 --> 27:51.365
Kids, hop on the fun train.

27:51.365 --> 27:52.845
Good morning.

27:52.845 --> 27:55.282
Top of the morning to you,
Captain Sandy.

27:55.282 --> 27:58.024
I'’ve gone full pirate.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.113
Good morning.

28:00.113 --> 28:01.462
Let'’s run through one more time.

28:01.462 --> 28:03.029
Alarms are going off.

28:03.029 --> 28:05.727
If you see any of the guests,
send them to the bridge.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.337
And the treasure will
be on the bow.

28:07.337 --> 28:08.948
Good morning.

28:08.948 --> 28:11.777
Cheffy, Cheffy, the guests
are at the table.

28:11.777 --> 28:15.563
Chef'’s special is omelets and
it'’s toppings of your choice.

28:15.563 --> 28:20.133
I will have a omelet
with eggs and black olives.

28:20.133 --> 28:21.569
- Just cheese in mine.
- Just cheese.

28:21.569 --> 28:22.744
I'’m not doing cocktails tonight.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.441
I'’m just going
to drink beers.

28:24.441 --> 28:26.748
I want to drink gin
and tonic like a classy gal.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.663
I'’m behaving.

28:28.663 --> 28:30.970
- I don'’t think I am.
- You'’ve got to tap that.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.493
- Who?
- Natalya.

28:32.493 --> 28:34.625
- Ah.
- You should just gun it.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.716
She'’s just a bit shy about
her----ing boyfriend.

28:39.021 --> 28:40.501
Exactly.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.851
Just go for it, you know.
It'’s allowed, so...

28:43.896 --> 28:45.027
- Hello.
- Hello.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.899
<i>Hi, Captain Sandy, it'’s Jess.</i>

28:46.899 --> 28:48.378
Hi, how are you feeling?

28:48.378 --> 28:51.686
<i>- A ton better.</i>
- That is so great.

28:51.686 --> 28:54.341
So I will see you at
the dock in Genoa.

28:54.341 --> 28:55.908
<i>I'’ll be there.</i>

28:55.908 --> 28:57.039
So this needs to be hidden.

28:57.039 --> 28:58.824
Sun deck.

28:58.824 --> 28:59.955
Ah.

28:59.955 --> 29:01.000
This is for you.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.263
Oh my God, it'’s beautiful.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.787
What time do you want
to do the treasure hunt?

29:05.787 --> 29:08.703
- Whatever is easiest.
- Okay, we can do it.

29:08.703 --> 29:10.400
- Ahoy, matey.
- Here, your first clue.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.575
You'’ll read it and then
you'’ll hand this...

29:11.575 --> 29:12.707
- I give the clue.
- Start off.

29:12.707 --> 29:14.230
- Perfect.
- Was it good?

29:14.230 --> 29:16.276
Very good.
We'’re winding down.

29:16.276 --> 29:17.364
Nice.

29:17.364 --> 29:19.714
Mm, mm, mm.

29:19.714 --> 29:21.194
Let'’s go downstairs. Bobo.

29:21.194 --> 29:22.195
We'’re leaving in here.

29:22.195 --> 29:23.718
<i>Natalya, Natalya.</i>

29:23.718 --> 29:25.764
- Go ahead.
<i>- You can start getting ready.</i>

29:25.764 --> 29:27.287
Copy.

29:27.287 --> 29:30.551
All crew, if we can start
getting into our positions.

29:30.551 --> 29:33.206
When I got into yachting,
I was a kid'’s coordinator

29:33.206 --> 29:34.729
and a nanny of
like three little boys.

29:34.729 --> 29:37.384
So pirate parties are
like definitely in my...

29:37.384 --> 29:39.473
I'’ve got them down pat.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.214
To your positions.

29:41.214 --> 29:44.304
Me and Luka can role play
pirates in my cabin later.

29:44.304 --> 29:45.784
All right.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.090
To the bridge!

29:48.090 --> 29:50.005
Run to the bridge!

29:51.354 --> 29:53.443
- Let'’s actually tie you to this.
- Okay.

29:53.443 --> 29:55.750
Ahoy, mateys.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.404
I need your help to find
the lost treasure

29:57.404 --> 29:58.840
of Yacht Mustique.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.015
Yes, Captain.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.322
Okay, here'’s your
first clue, boys.

30:02.322 --> 30:04.585
"Near the piano, you will
see a cannon ball

30:04.585 --> 30:06.239
with a clue near a key."

30:06.239 --> 30:07.414
Whoa...

30:07.414 --> 30:09.764
Let'’s go! Let's go!

30:09.764 --> 30:11.418
Oh, near a key.
It would be here.

30:11.418 --> 30:12.898
Oh, well, it'’s here.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.813
Captain Danger'’s going
to read the next clue.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.597
Clue number two.

30:16.597 --> 30:19.426
"Outside the doors, you will
see a cannon ball game.

30:19.426 --> 30:23.430
You need to score three
to receive your next clue."

30:23.430 --> 30:25.345
- Cannon ball game.
- Woo hoo!

30:25.345 --> 30:27.477
Yay!

30:27.477 --> 30:30.611
"Find a pirate fight with
a Captain Sharkbite."

30:30.611 --> 30:33.353
Ooh! Who will stop me?

30:33.353 --> 30:35.790
Captain Sharkbite!
Get Captain Sharkbite!

30:35.790 --> 30:38.880
You, too! Oh, oh!

30:45.278 --> 30:46.279
Oh, my God. Oopsie.

30:46.279 --> 30:47.933
Oh, here'’s the next one.

30:47.933 --> 30:52.372
"Find the cook with the hook to
take a look at the last clue."

30:52.372 --> 30:53.503
Find the cook with the hook.

30:53.503 --> 30:54.722
There he is, back there!

30:56.985 --> 30:58.639
Okay, you win.

30:58.639 --> 31:02.686
"Pirate'’s flag secures the bag
to receive the last clue."

31:07.039 --> 31:08.605
It'’s a real treasure boat.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.131
This was so sweet.

31:12.131 --> 31:13.828
- Natalya'’s so great.
- Thank you so much.

31:13.828 --> 31:15.656
- It was fun.
- Really fun.

31:15.656 --> 31:17.745
Give that back to me.

31:17.745 --> 31:20.835
Natalya'’s treasure hunt
is amazing.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.706
And this is why I wanted
her to do it,

31:22.706 --> 31:25.231
because I knew this is
something she would enjoy.

31:25.231 --> 31:26.972
That'’s up her alley.

31:26.972 --> 31:29.496
And I don'’t have to do it,
because I couldn'’t care less.

31:29.496 --> 31:31.541
And she puts so much
love into it

31:31.541 --> 31:33.848
that I'’m actually
really, really proud.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.328
- In.
- We can pull it in.

31:35.328 --> 31:36.807
Yeah.

31:36.807 --> 31:38.331
Nice.

31:38.331 --> 31:39.506
We'’re going to send
the crane down.

31:39.506 --> 31:40.681
- Yeah.
- Good job.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.030
- Thank you.
- Well done.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.858
- Thank you for participating.
- It was fun.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.164
It kind of lifted my spirits.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.817
Oh, no.
Not to the other eye.

31:46.817 --> 31:48.384
It'’s the only way I can see.

31:49.777 --> 31:53.868
Deck crew, uncover
the wing stations, please.

31:53.868 --> 31:56.044
Copy that.

31:56.044 --> 31:58.046
Brought so much stuff.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.787
Anchor up.
Anchor up.

31:59.787 --> 32:02.181
Outside.
Up and down.

32:05.749 --> 32:07.926
Anchor at the water line.

32:10.406 --> 32:11.712
Anchor at home.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.366
- Good job.
- Thank you, Max.

32:13.366 --> 32:16.151
Max is definitely a lot more
productive when he'’s encouraged.

32:16.151 --> 32:18.153
I think he takes a
lot more initiative as well,

32:18.153 --> 32:19.894
and he takes a bit more
pride in his work.

32:19.894 --> 32:21.852
It'’s good to finally
start learning

32:21.852 --> 32:24.420
how he works instead of
just getting frustrated.

32:24.420 --> 32:25.552
Nice work.

32:25.552 --> 32:27.119
<i>Thank you very much, captain.</i>

32:37.477 --> 32:39.218
We'’re going to maneuver,
I'’ve already pulled the rail.

32:39.218 --> 32:40.262
Good.

32:40.262 --> 32:41.960
What are you thankful for, Bo?

32:41.960 --> 32:43.744
Are we thankful that we had
such a good time in this boat?

32:43.744 --> 32:44.963
Yes.

32:47.748 --> 32:49.271
I'’ll miss you.

32:49.271 --> 32:51.621
Sandy, Sandy, are you happy
for us to put the fenders over?

32:51.621 --> 32:52.971
Yes.
Go ahead.

32:54.668 --> 32:56.278
I'’m going to take it
on the starboard wing.

32:56.278 --> 32:57.714
Your port side is clear.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.281
You'’re free to swing
whenever you want.

32:59.281 --> 33:01.936
I'’ll do the port side.
You can do the starboard side.

33:01.936 --> 33:03.677
30 meters to the boat
on your starboard side.

33:03.677 --> 33:05.331
We'’re going in between
these two right here.

33:05.331 --> 33:06.636
Oh, we'’re going in there.

33:06.636 --> 33:07.637
Going there?

33:07.637 --> 33:09.291
Interior, interior.

33:09.291 --> 33:11.206
If anyone'’s available, could we
get a hand with the fenders?

33:11.206 --> 33:12.642
Copy, on my way.

33:12.642 --> 33:14.949
The gap looks----ing
smaller than the boat.

33:14.949 --> 33:17.299
How the [bleep] am I going to
squeeze this thing in there?

33:17.299 --> 33:18.474
What do you want me to do?

33:18.474 --> 33:19.649
Just stand at one
of the fenders.

33:19.649 --> 33:21.129
We'’re going pretty tight spot.

33:21.129 --> 33:22.696
I'’ll stay on this one.

33:22.696 --> 33:24.872
You'’ve got 20 meters to the
ground line astern.

33:24.872 --> 33:28.397
I don'’t know how Sandy trusts me
to----ing call this thing in.

33:28.397 --> 33:30.182
Two meters on
your starboard side.

33:30.182 --> 33:32.793
We'’ve got one meter
on our starboard side.

33:32.793 --> 33:34.012
15 meters to the dock.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.014
I don'’t know what I'm doing.

33:38.929 --> 33:40.844
<i>15 meters to the dock.</i>

33:40.844 --> 33:42.368
I don'’t know if we'll
fit in there.

33:42.368 --> 33:43.934
<i>You'’ve got two meters
on your port side,</i>

33:43.934 --> 33:45.675
just passing the
ground lines now.

33:45.675 --> 33:47.503
Two meters on
your starboard side.

33:47.503 --> 33:48.852
Oh, it'’s quite a close fit.

33:48.852 --> 33:51.333
I don'’t know what I'm doing.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.031
I'’m stressing.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.467
You'’ve got one meter on your
port side at the moment.

33:54.467 --> 33:55.598
All good over there, Haleigh?

33:55.598 --> 33:58.036
Yep.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.689
- Yeah.
- She is amazing.

33:59.689 --> 34:01.430
Look how----ing tight we are.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.563
Okay, you'’ve got one meter
on your port side,

34:03.563 --> 34:04.912
<i>ten meters to the dock.</i>

34:04.912 --> 34:06.000
That'’s good.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.523
We'’re looking good, Sandy.

34:07.523 --> 34:10.004
We'’re just throwing
our lines ashore now.

34:10.004 --> 34:11.788
As soon as they'’re giving to us.

34:11.788 --> 34:13.181
How are you doing
up there, Lara?

34:13.181 --> 34:15.618
- You'’ve got some tension.
- No, it'’s good.

34:15.618 --> 34:17.142
Okay, there'’s nice tension here.

34:17.142 --> 34:19.144
Cool, we'’re starting
to get tension back here.

34:19.144 --> 34:21.885
- Well done, brother.
- Good job, everyone.

34:21.885 --> 34:24.279
It was amazing.

34:24.279 --> 34:25.802
That was so stressful.

34:25.802 --> 34:27.630
Oh, we got it.
Why are you stressed out?

34:27.630 --> 34:28.892
- That was awesome.
- Yeah, yeah.

34:28.892 --> 34:30.459
Luka really drove it in.

34:30.459 --> 34:31.721
I will see you soon.

34:31.721 --> 34:33.114
All good on the bow?

34:33.114 --> 34:35.334
I'’m not going to do
any push-up today.

34:35.334 --> 34:38.380
All crew, all crew.
Let'’s meet for guest departure.

34:38.380 --> 34:39.642
we smashed that.

34:39.642 --> 34:41.862
All right.
See you later.

34:41.862 --> 34:43.777
Thank you for everything.
Thank you so much.

34:43.777 --> 34:44.778
Goodbye.

34:44.778 --> 34:45.822
Oh, Jack.

34:45.822 --> 34:47.128
Well, we are so lucky.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.870
This has been
the best vacation ever.

34:49.870 --> 34:51.872
The thought and effort
behind the treasure hunt

34:51.872 --> 34:52.873
warms my heart.

34:52.873 --> 34:53.961
Thank you.

34:53.961 --> 34:55.180
- Sandy, we love you.
- Thank you.

34:55.180 --> 34:56.746
We always feel safe
in your hands.

34:56.746 --> 34:58.748
- Thank you for the opportunity.
- Thank you.

34:58.748 --> 35:00.663
- Peace and love.
- Bye.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.230
Peace and love.
All right.

35:02.230 --> 35:03.884
Out of our whites,
into our reds.

35:03.884 --> 35:05.668
We'’ll meet in the Sky Lounge
for our tip meeting.

35:05.668 --> 35:07.453
- Thank you.
- Good job.

35:11.805 --> 35:13.633
Do you want to massage me?

35:13.633 --> 35:14.721
Mm-hmm.

35:14.721 --> 35:15.722
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.

35:15.722 --> 35:17.115
Hey, mate, that was quick.

35:18.159 --> 35:19.769
What just happened?

35:19.769 --> 35:20.988
Nothing.

35:20.988 --> 35:22.250
Why'’d you get a
semi on her butt?

35:22.250 --> 35:25.123
- Shut up, Kyle.
- It wasn'’t a semi.

35:26.036 --> 35:27.342
The tension is high.

35:27.342 --> 35:29.127
This game'’s been going
on too long.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.911
Hopefully something
happens tonight.

35:30.911 --> 35:33.609
I'’ll be rubbing my balls
with grease if not.

35:34.741 --> 35:35.959
Cuckoo.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.353
- Is that everybody?
- Missing Jess.

35:38.353 --> 35:39.746
- Missing Jess.
- Sorry I'’m late.

35:39.746 --> 35:43.793
Okay, so interior.
Amazing job.

35:43.793 --> 35:45.143
You were down a person.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.883
I never had any concern.

35:46.883 --> 35:49.843
What you did for
the treasure hunt was,

35:49.843 --> 35:51.105
yes, let'’s give her a hand.

35:51.105 --> 35:52.585
- Thanks guys.
- Because that was...

35:52.585 --> 35:53.977
Thank you.

35:53.977 --> 35:55.805
Luka, you stepped into
a bosun'’s position

35:55.805 --> 35:57.981
like you have been there.

35:57.981 --> 35:59.722
Anyway, good job.
Let'’s give him a hand.

35:59.722 --> 36:00.984
He deserves one.

36:00.984 --> 36:03.596
And Lara, all right,
lead deck hand.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.511
Let'’s just say you did
an awesome job.

36:05.511 --> 36:08.992
You see what needs
to get done, and you do it.

36:08.992 --> 36:11.212
- And thank you.
- Thanks.

36:11.212 --> 36:13.171
Honestly, you'’re
an awesome team.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.955
- Such a good team.
- Yes.

36:14.955 --> 36:17.392
You'’re going to like this.

36:17.392 --> 36:18.654
$28,000.

36:18.654 --> 36:20.482
What?

36:20.482 --> 36:22.310
Yes, please.

36:22.310 --> 36:25.139
$2,300 a person.

36:25.139 --> 36:26.836
Woo!

36:26.836 --> 36:29.970
- And that speaks volume.
- Yes!

36:29.970 --> 36:33.016
So Jess is returning.
She'’s all clear.

36:33.016 --> 36:34.540
So you'’re going to
have that support back.

36:34.540 --> 36:37.020
Well done, everyone.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.326
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

36:45.812 --> 36:48.031
Yeah!

36:48.031 --> 36:49.642
My main queen.

36:49.642 --> 36:50.991
Come, come, come.

36:50.991 --> 36:52.340
- How are you?
- How the [bleep] are you doing?

36:52.340 --> 36:53.994
- You okay?
- I'’m great.

36:53.994 --> 36:57.432
I'’m feeling 99.99% better.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.217
I'’ll do everything that
I need to do.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.394
Heads, beds, service,
housekeeping, laundry.

37:02.394 --> 37:05.527
Put me in, coach.
I'’m ready.

37:05.527 --> 37:08.095
- Are you feeling better?
- Much better, girl.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.705
You even look better.

37:09.705 --> 37:13.318
Of course, Jess would all of a
sudden be okay on the night out.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.581
Yeah, I'’m the first
to get ready.

37:15.581 --> 37:18.279
- That looks very beautiful.
- Thanks, honey.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.063
- Natalya.
- What?

37:20.063 --> 37:21.064
Girth or length?

37:21.064 --> 37:22.892
Ah, girth.

37:22.892 --> 37:24.546
I love a bit of girth, eh?

37:24.546 --> 37:25.634
Luka!

37:25.634 --> 37:27.462
He flashed his
dick in the mirror.

37:27.462 --> 37:28.768
I want to see.

37:28.768 --> 37:30.465
Why is it so big?

37:30.465 --> 37:31.510
What'’s big?

37:31.510 --> 37:33.207
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:33.207 --> 37:35.253
- All right, let'’s----ing go.
- Let'’s----ing go this way.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.863
- Come on.
- Come on.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.256
Come on, come on.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.736
Kyle, have you ever been
down on a girl?

37:40.736 --> 37:42.085
I could never.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.349
But let me stick
my finger up on a prostate

37:44.349 --> 37:47.395
and I will send you
to the next world.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.746
This is the most
sexual group ever.

37:50.746 --> 37:52.922
Thank you.

37:52.922 --> 37:54.141
Oh, my gosh.

37:54.141 --> 37:55.403
Let'’s go.

37:55.403 --> 37:57.318
Everyone take a shot,
just one more.

37:57.318 --> 37:59.755
- One shot.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:59.755 --> 38:02.018
Thank you.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.804
Nothing'’s happening on
the boat for me, is it?

38:04.804 --> 38:06.632
Let'’s face it.
So I'’ve got to venture out.

38:06.632 --> 38:07.981
I'’ve got to go mingling.

38:09.156 --> 38:10.462
She'’ll do.

38:15.684 --> 38:18.208
Every time, me and Luka
touch at this stage.

38:18.208 --> 38:19.427
I don'’t know.

38:19.427 --> 38:21.211
I feel like
I'’m a sex addict.

38:21.211 --> 38:22.691
Like Jesus Christ.
I'’m, like, sweating.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.847
Lady in Red.

38:51.764 --> 38:52.765
Hey, hey, hey.

38:53.853 --> 38:57.204
Yes!

39:14.526 --> 39:19.226
A.J. wants her to be, like,
not sleeping with anybody else,

39:19.226 --> 39:21.010
but he gets to sleep
with everybody else?

39:21.010 --> 39:22.490
- you.
- I know.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.057
No.

39:48.429 --> 39:51.127
Uh-huh.
that sh--.

39:51.127 --> 39:53.782
There'’s totally sexual tension
between Luka and Natalya.

39:53.782 --> 39:55.654
I think she doesn'’t really
know what she wants.

39:55.654 --> 39:58.221
I'’m like, just do it already.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.236
Oh, my God!

40:19.460 --> 40:20.809
You don'’t have to
talk about him.

40:20.809 --> 40:21.767
Are you okay, darling?

40:33.474 --> 40:35.520
There we are, Daddy.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.999
Hello.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.392
What'’s going on?

40:42.048 --> 40:43.919
The chase goes on.

40:45.573 --> 40:47.009
Let'’s go, Grandma.

40:47.009 --> 40:49.708
No, leave that! Leave that,
leave that, leave that,

40:49.708 --> 40:51.405
leave that, leave that, leave
that, leave it, leave it.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.322
Kyle, open up the----ing door.

40:55.322 --> 40:56.758
Back.

40:56.758 --> 40:59.065
Oh, my God.

40:59.065 --> 41:01.502
Jesus.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.896
He can do what he wants,
but you can'’t do what you want?

41:03.896 --> 41:04.853
I don'’t know about that.

41:07.073 --> 41:08.640
Jacuzzi.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.120
Kiss right now!
Stop being stupid!

41:11.120 --> 41:13.079
- Kiss!
- Yeah!

41:13.079 --> 41:14.733
That doesn'’t count!

41:14.733 --> 41:16.561
Yeah!

41:16.561 --> 41:17.997
What the [bleep] have I done?

41:17.997 --> 41:19.477
Bad, bad, bad.

41:19.477 --> 41:20.782
So good, but so bad.

41:23.611 --> 41:25.308
Ah!

41:27.267 --> 41:28.964
Not you, [bleep].

41:50.812 --> 41:52.335
What is it?

41:52.335 --> 41:53.380
What can we do for you?

41:53.380 --> 41:54.860
I need to put this back.

41:54.860 --> 41:57.427
Okay, bye.
I'’m going to the thing.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.012
- Kyle, you can come in.
- Oh, Jesus.

42:24.977 --> 42:26.544
Oh!

42:27.719 --> 42:30.417
Ugh!

42:30.417 --> 42:32.680
- Sweet dreams, angels.
- Good night.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.741
A.J.'’s calling me.

42:49.741 --> 42:51.525
Bye.

42:54.659 --> 42:56.574
- He'’ll see you right here.
- Go for it.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.880
No, it'’s not going to be good.

42:58.880 --> 43:01.361
Go for it.
It'’s going to be funny.

43:01.361 --> 43:03.015
It'’s not funny.
This is my life.

43:03.015 --> 43:04.625
I'’ll leave, she's got to have
a phone call with A.J.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.975
No, [bleep] off, Nat.
We'’re chilling.

43:06.975 --> 43:09.021
Nat, answer it.

43:09.021 --> 43:11.632
- No, don'’t answer it.
- It'’s not funny.

43:11.632 --> 43:14.026
I'’m so confused
on what'’s happening.

43:14.026 --> 43:15.201
Yeah, get in line.

43:15.201 --> 43:16.594
This is not going to be good.

43:19.771 --> 43:21.686
Next time on
"Below Deck Mediterranean"...

43:21.686 --> 43:24.427
- Oh, my God.
- Hi!

43:24.427 --> 43:25.907
Hi!

43:25.907 --> 43:27.561
Since they'’re all women
and they'’re quite young,

43:27.561 --> 43:30.042
as much as you'’re tempted,
maintain your...

43:30.042 --> 43:33.611
- I love this suit.
- Your suit'’s amazing.

43:33.611 --> 43:35.395
Told me to be honest with you.
That was it.

43:35.395 --> 43:37.658
You'’re acting like I'm about
to move away with this person.

43:37.658 --> 43:39.442
What'’s wrong?

43:39.442 --> 43:42.489
I just don'’t think mentally,
I'’m doing well in the boat.

43:42.489 --> 43:44.273
Why would you go to
Tumi behind my back

43:44.273 --> 43:46.580
and tell her that I make
you feel like a green stew?

43:46.580 --> 43:48.930
It'’s not like talking sh--.

43:48.930 --> 43:51.063
I'’ve been the common denominator
between all of you,

43:51.063 --> 43:52.847
uniting a team.

43:52.847 --> 43:55.589
