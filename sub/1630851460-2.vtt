How you doing, buddy?

00:19.002 --> 00:20.352
Uh, here's the situation.

00:20.429 --> 00:23.022
There was an accident
on an oil rig a few miles away.

00:23.098 --> 00:24.931
It's currently dumping
about 40,000 gallons

00:25.084 --> 00:27.100

but we're evacuating everyone.

specifically asked you not to?

01:31.074 --> 01:33.241
My entire job
is to keep shooting.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.760
It was very compelling
television.

01:34.911 --> 01:36.077
You guys should air it.

02:17.787 --> 02:19.471
No, no, I took it to the store,

02:19.623 --> 02:21.473

explained to me

02:21.625 --> 02:24.309
that my husband watches
seven hours of porn a day.

02:24.386 --> 02:26.052
Are you masturbating

It might be my last chance

My daughter moved back in
with her kids,

03:43.782 --> 03:44.948
and they're awful.

03:44.950 --> 03:46.708
My husband works from home,

03:46.727 --> 03:49.578

34:48.145 --> 34:50.403
they gave me
these radioactive steroids.

And when I emerged
from my medically-induced coma,

I was a gorgeous butterfly

-That's beautiful.
-Thank you.

You know, I actually think
that the swan spell in the show

34:59.289 --> 35:00.989
is an allegory
for childhood acne.

35:01.007 --> 35:02.340
Well, I know you think
that's a joke,

35:02.509 --> 35:04.584
but that's actually my secret
backstory for the Black Swan.

35:04.603 --> 35:08.605
So--okay, two turns this time.
Don't think about it.

35:08.756 --> 35:10.107
Just do it! Go!

35:12.260 --> 35:15.503
-Oh!
-That didn't suck.
