WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.502
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.753 --> 00:04.379
It's been 97 years since
a nuclear apocalypse

00:04.588 --> 00:05.838
killed everyone on earth.

00:06.048 --> 00:07.006
You're being sent
to the ground.

00:07.216 --> 00:08.341
All 100 of you.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.551
Prisoners of the ark,
you have one job:

00:10.761 --> 00:11.594
Stay alive.

00:11.804 --> 00:13.179
We did it!

00:13.389 --> 00:14.514
We are not alone.

00:14.723 --> 00:17.266
The last man from the ground
died on the ark?

00:17.476 --> 00:18.685
He wasn't
the last grounder.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.144
There's an army
of grounders

00:20.354 --> 00:21.270
coming for us
right now.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.234
Jasper, now.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.071
Are we really
gonna do this?

00:30.280 --> 00:31.781
Bring the ark
to the ground.

00:31.991 --> 00:33.074
Friction will break the ark

00:33.283 --> 00:34.867
back into its original stations.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.911
Hailing all
ark survivors.

00:37.121 --> 00:38.830
Mecha station
is on the ground.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.832
- Look.
- It might be another station.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.042
Find the rest of our people, Abby.
Find Clarke.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.648
Hey. Hey! Hey!

01:47.858 --> 01:50.485
Hey! Where's Monty?

01:52.988 --> 01:54.822
What the hell did you
do to him?

02:15.469 --> 02:16.302
Ah!

02:36.115 --> 02:37.198
What are
you doing?

02:37.407 --> 02:38.407
I'll be
contaminated.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.328
Where's my friend?

02:42.538 --> 02:44.956
He's fine.
You don't understand, OK?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.958
He's--uhh!

02:47.167 --> 02:48.292
Take me to him.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.132
Uhh! Clarke,
you're bleeding.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.091
How do you know
my name?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.050
It was
on your chart.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.468
How do they
know my name?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.554
I don't know.
Please don't hurt me.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.931
You want to live?

03:02.141 --> 03:03.266
Do exactly
what I say.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.435
I don't think so.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.312
Key card.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.064
I just need
my key card.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.784
Which level?

03:33.672 --> 03:35.256
Who are you people?

03:35.465 --> 03:36.549
Answer me.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.884
How many of us
are here?

03:38.093 --> 03:40.636
Where are they?
Say something!

03:40.846 --> 03:43.055
Arrived. Level 5.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.997
Containment breach.
Containment breach!

04:16.840 --> 04:17.798
Where the hell am I?

04:33.857 --> 04:34.815
Bellamy?

04:37.194 --> 04:38.444
Get back down.

04:38.654 --> 04:39.820
You were followed?
Quiet.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.157
Have you
seen Finn?

04:43.367 --> 04:44.825
- Finn's alive?
- He was.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.160
We got separated.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.620
We knew the fire was
coming, so, we ran,

04:47.829 --> 04:48.788
but one of them
followed.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.459
How'd you guys
get out?

04:53.669 --> 04:55.336
We--we saw
the ark come down.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.796
We thought we'd
come get help.

04:57.005 --> 04:57.838
Piece of it
came down this way.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.298
Monroe thinks
it's Mecha,

04:59.508 --> 05:01.342
but personally, I think--

05:02.386 --> 05:03.386
Follow me.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.137
Stay low
and quiet.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.610
I can't--
I can't go anymore.

05:21.196 --> 05:24.198
Uhh! Ooh!
On your feet.

05:24.408 --> 05:25.700
I can't.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.076
He can't keep up.

05:27.286 --> 05:28.869
I said get on
your feet.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.496
Get up.

05:32.040 --> 05:32.915
Uhh!

05:34.960 --> 05:36.335
No!
Uhh!

05:36.545 --> 05:37.336
No!

05:44.177 --> 05:46.137
That's one.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.722
I lost 300.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.187
Uhh.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.408
Drink.
You're lucky.

06:09.578 --> 06:10.911
I need to keep
one of you alive

06:11.121 --> 06:12.288
to talk to
the commander.

06:14.458 --> 06:15.291
Get up.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.934
Al laik Okteivia kom skai kru
en Al gaf gouthru Klin.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.895
"Klir," not "Klin."

06:36.104 --> 06:38.189
"Gouthru Klir."
Again.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.857
"I'm Octavia
of the sky people

06:40.067 --> 06:41.233
and I seek
safe passage."

06:41.443 --> 06:42.651
Why do I even
have to learn this?

06:42.861 --> 06:44.737
You speak English.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.239
Only our warriors
speak English.

06:47.449 --> 06:48.491
When we get
to the sea, you need

06:48.700 --> 06:50.201
to sound like
one of us.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.202
Then we have time.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.622
Tell me about
this one.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.211
A statue near
my village.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.962
A place we go
to settle disputes.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.841
Stop stalling
and pull it out.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.553
No warning? Nothing?

07:14.643 --> 07:17.395
I take it back.
No warning is better.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.070
Ahh. Oh, my God.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.785
Poison.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.665
I'm guessing this means
you don't have the antidote?

07:37.874 --> 07:40.626
No. I gave it to
Finn to save raven.

07:40.836 --> 07:41.669
So, we go back.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.212
It's too far.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.380
It's further
to the sea.

07:45.841 --> 07:46.632
Damn it.

07:46.842 --> 07:47.967
Lincoln, we are not

07:48.176 --> 07:50.136
going back
to your village.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.554
You know what
they do to traitors.

07:51.763 --> 07:54.598
Octavia.
Death by 1,000 cuts.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.642
Every single member
of your clan

07:56.852 --> 07:59.645
will take a turn
stabbing you,

07:59.855 --> 08:01.689
and then they'll
feed you to the bugs.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.275
It's what
you told me.

08:06.361 --> 08:07.653
Here. Take this.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.530
Here. Hey.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.282
I will
be right back.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.950
Lincoln,
where are you going?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.285
The antidote.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.411
It comes from
the beetles that

08:15.620 --> 08:16.454
feed on
the river moss.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.291
You're gonna feed
on the beetles.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.333
It'll work.

09:11.885 --> 09:12.718
Uhh!

09:35.575 --> 09:38.035
W-whoa, it's OK.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.578
It's OK,
raven, don't.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.539
Don't shoot.
Please.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.999
Why not?
You shot me.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.357
Yeah, I would've
shot me, too.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.002
Hello, Clarke.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.087
How is your arm?

10:32.465 --> 10:35.259
Not much of
a talker, is she?

10:35.468 --> 10:38.554
Skill picked up from the savages,
no doubt.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.055
That's fine.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.976
Maya has something
to say first anyway.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.437
You were the next one
to be cleared through quarantine.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.606
- Another 10 minutes and you would've--
- ahem.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.276
I'm not
pressing charges.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.612
Thank you, Maya.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.447
You can get your
treatment now.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.033
OK. Let's go.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.618
Bed 3.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.953
Restraints aren't
necessary.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.204
Yes, Mr. president.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.629
Dante Wallace.

11:13.715 --> 11:14.590
Oil paint.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.968
That's right.
You're an artist, too.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.347
Who told you that?

11:21.556 --> 11:22.556
Your people did.

11:22.766 --> 11:25.100
They also said
you were their leader.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.352
Looks like you and I

11:26.561 --> 11:28.103
have a lot
in common, kiddo.

11:30.774 --> 11:31.774
Where's my watch?

11:31.983 --> 11:33.567
I'm sorry,
but we can't let

11:33.777 --> 11:37.071
contaminated items
inside Mount Weather.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.697
We couldn't
risk it.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.908
Our protocol is
very strict, Clarke.

11:41.117 --> 11:44.870
We prioritize safety
over sentimentality.

11:49.584 --> 11:50.751
How many of us
did you capture?

11:50.960 --> 11:53.212
48, including you,

11:53.421 --> 11:54.838
but Clarke,
you've got it wrong.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.424
You're not prisoners.
We saved you.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.176
Well, in that case,
you won't mind if we leave.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.761
If there are
48 of us here,

12:00.970 --> 12:02.179
we still have
people out there.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.598
The patrol brought in
everyone they could find.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.975
What about the ark?
It came down last...

12:07.185 --> 12:09.103
We saw it.
There were multiple crash sites

12:09.312 --> 12:10.604
over 100 square Miles.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.314
If there
were survivors,

12:12.524 --> 12:13.899
we will bring them
in, too.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.651
You have my word.

12:15.860 --> 12:16.777
I want to see
my people.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.530
Of course you do.
I would, too.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.630
Change and meet me
in the hall.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.092
Come on.
Let's go.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.010
Let's give Clarke
some privacy.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.336
OK. Just
take care of it.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.843
Sorry about
the noise.

13:23.052 --> 13:26.472
Hydroelectric power
from Philpott Dam.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.432
Fresh water
from our own

13:28.641 --> 13:30.726
underground reservoir.

13:30.935 --> 13:34.104
Fresh food from
our hydroponic farm.

13:34.314 --> 13:38.317
I don't understand.
You're on the ground.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.903
You know
it's survivable.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.029
Why would you stay here?

13:42.238 --> 13:44.031
It's not survivable
for us.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.783
The grounders seem
to have managed.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.202
Natural selection works.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.162
The grounders who
couldn't survive

13:50.371 --> 13:51.830
in the radiation didn't.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.541
Those who could
passed on their DNA.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.084
For better or
for worse here,

13:56.294 --> 13:57.920
we never went
through that process.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.880
Well, neither
did we.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.715
We've been on
the ground now for...

14:03.468 --> 14:05.052
Solar radiation.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.137
Very good.
Your DNA ran

14:07.347 --> 14:09.807
the same gauntlet
as the grounders.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.184
Only because radiation
levels in space

14:12.393 --> 14:14.228
are even higher,
your ability to

14:14.437 --> 14:18.065
metabolize that radiation
is even stronger.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.150
Truth be told,
our scientists

14:20.360 --> 14:23.862
were blown away by the
efficiency of your systems.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.280
If not for that,
your friends would

14:25.490 --> 14:27.199
still be upstairs
in quarantine.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.409
Please.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.344
First give me
the heel.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.523
You're not fighting
for your life anymore, Clarke.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.400
You've made it.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.068
Welcome to
Mount Weather.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.116
Arrived. 5.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.201
Your packet contains
everything you need to know

15:11.411 --> 15:12.077
about Mount Weather,

15:12.287 --> 15:14.621
which I promise
is not as confusing

15:14.831 --> 15:16.957
as the map on page one
makes it up to look.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.835
You came from level 3,

15:20.044 --> 15:21.962
which houses our
medical facility including...

15:22.171 --> 15:22.963
Clarke.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.217
Hi.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.260
You're OK.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.678
Hey.
Hi.

15:31.097 --> 15:31.972
Oh, my--

15:33.433 --> 15:34.641
Finn and Bellamy?

15:36.728 --> 15:38.645
Clarke, they...

15:41.274 --> 15:42.357
They didn't make it.

15:43.735 --> 15:44.860
We don't know that.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.156
What about raven?

15:52.118 --> 15:52.993
Welcome, Clarke.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.330
If you have
any questions, I'm Keenan.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.271
What are you doing
here, Murphy?

16:22.774 --> 16:25.317
Dying. Same as you.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.951
Speak for yourself.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.287
How many more are out there?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.122
None.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.582
You fried them all.
The only reason

16:40.792 --> 16:41.875
this one survived
is because they left him

16:42.085 --> 16:43.293
behind to guard me.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.974
Raven.
Lie on your side.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.809
Lie on your side.
Come on.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.394
Fine, then just
roll over yourself.

17:00.603 --> 17:01.520
Get down
on your side.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.238
You're OK.
It's all good.

17:11.447 --> 17:12.990
Why are you
helping me?

17:18.496 --> 17:19.788
I don't want
to die alone.

17:31.509 --> 17:32.634
I know you're scared,

17:32.844 --> 17:34.678
but we are warriors.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.096
We can do this.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.472
How?

17:37.682 --> 17:38.765
We attack as a team.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.851
When he goes for me,
Monroe goes for Finn.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.686
Once he's free,
it's 4 on one.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.687
What do I do?

17:45.148 --> 17:46.314
Try not to die.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.987
Ready? 1, 2, 3.

17:54.615 --> 17:55.490
Hey!

18:00.163 --> 18:02.289
Bellamy,
get out of here!

18:02.498 --> 18:03.290
Hyah!

18:05.126 --> 18:06.001
Hyah!

18:06.210 --> 18:08.253
Aah!

18:08.463 --> 18:09.254
Uhh!

18:39.702 --> 18:42.162
Octavia. Octavia.
What is it?

18:42.371 --> 18:44.206
Hey. What--
what's wrong? What--

18:46.292 --> 18:48.168
there's someone down--

18:48.377 --> 18:51.046
it was--it was a--
a monster.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.507
It's the poison.
You're burning up.

18:53.716 --> 18:54.758
We have to hurry.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.807
I know what
we have to do.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.892
What are you doing?
Where are we going?

19:04.102 --> 19:05.018
Just hold on.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.160
You have to try
this pie.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.292
Oh, my God.
What is that?

19:29.502 --> 19:30.710
I don't know,
but it's great.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.505
Mm. My turn.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.007
What, this?
Nah. You won't like it.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.217
The pie's way better.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.014
Really?

19:44.642 --> 19:45.433
OK.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.355
Oh. Hey. Clarke.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.484
Sit down and pretend
you're happy to see me.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.778
We are happy
to see you.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.780
You have to try
the chocolate cake.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.490
Oh, it is
so on.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.908
I'm not eating
their food.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.163
Look.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.917
They gave us a map
with no exits.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.044
I need you to
tell me everything you've seen.

20:13.254 --> 20:17.007
Every room,
every hallway, every way out.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.008
Way out?

20:20.094 --> 20:22.137
Look around
you, Clarke.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.723
There's no one
hunting us here.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.349
First time in our
lives we're not hungry.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.726
Why would we
want to leave?

20:27.935 --> 20:29.102
Because we have
friends out there

20:29.312 --> 20:30.312
who need our help.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.272
They're looking for survivors,

20:32.481 --> 20:34.941
and they're way better equipped
to find them than we are.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.902
This place is
too good to be true.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.904
You're bumming me out.
I'm--I'm gonna

20:39.113 --> 20:40.197
get more cake.

20:54.754 --> 20:55.837
Take mine.

20:56.047 --> 20:59.841
Thanks.
Jasper.

21:00.051 --> 21:00.926
Maya.

21:01.135 --> 21:01.927
Cold hands.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.638
Low vitamin D.

21:04.847 --> 21:05.931
Unlike yours,
which is

21:06.140 --> 21:07.265
off the charts,
by the way.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.479
Well. All right.
I was excited.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.941
Mm. Oh.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.695
No chocolate
in space, huh?

21:20.905 --> 21:22.030
Space sucked.

21:23.950 --> 21:27.244
What's the deal with
all this stuff, anyway?

21:27.453 --> 21:28.745
This is nothing.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.289
There's an entire warehouse
with just paintings.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.667
President Wallace is
the first to hang them up.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.752
Guess he figured just because
we don't have windows

21:35.962 --> 21:37.087
doesn't mean we
can't have a view.

21:40.132 --> 21:40.966
Hey.

21:43.177 --> 21:44.678
It's Maya, right?

21:47.265 --> 21:48.390
I just wanted
to say sorry

21:48.599 --> 21:49.516
for this morning.

21:51.185 --> 21:52.936
I was scared and worried
about my friends.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.105
I hope you can
understand that.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.452
I know she's
intense, but...

22:11.205 --> 22:12.914
Clarke's the only
reason we survived.

22:18.587 --> 22:19.796
She took my key card.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.467
Alert. Code 5.

22:25.720 --> 22:26.928
Not a prisoner, huh?

23:10.306 --> 23:11.431
Get that door open.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.142
Now stand clear.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.814
Unauthorized access.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.069
Unauthorized access.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.992
Unauthorized access.

23:36.999 --> 23:37.791
Unauthorized access.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.376
Clarke, no!

23:39.585 --> 23:41.795
If you pull that lever,
these people will die.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.380
Even a little radiation
can kill them.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.090
Unauthorized access.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.345
Don't make me
shoot you.

24:00.523 --> 24:01.356
Wait.

24:02.191 --> 24:03.024
Wait.

24:06.404 --> 24:07.237
Clarke.

24:08.406 --> 24:09.322
Don't do this.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.283
I don't believe them.

24:13.869 --> 24:14.828
Why would they lie?

24:17.540 --> 24:20.291
Listen to me.
We are safe here

24:20.501 --> 24:21.292
because of you.

24:22.628 --> 24:23.461
We're safe.

24:24.922 --> 24:25.839
Not all of us.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.345
I'm the one that
fired the rockets.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.474
Should I not
have done that?

24:36.684 --> 24:39.477
Clarke...When you
pulled that lever,

24:39.687 --> 24:40.562
you saved lives.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.898
Don't throw that away
by pulling this one.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.740
There she is!
Hold it right there.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.034
Get your hands up.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.885
How did you get to be
such a dick, Murphy?

25:12.094 --> 25:15.722
I'm sorry for
shooting you, OK?

25:17.308 --> 25:18.433
Is that what
you want to hear?

25:20.352 --> 25:23.354
Let me guess.
Mommy and daddy didn't love you?

25:25.441 --> 25:26.608
No, they loved me.

25:30.779 --> 25:33.364
Are you gonna
cry, Murphy?

25:33.574 --> 25:35.450
Screw you, raven.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.911
No, tell me.
I want to know.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.455
How does a kid who's
loved by his parents

25:40.664 --> 25:42.707
turn into
a murdering psychopath?

25:52.092 --> 25:53.301
He gets the flu.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.431
His father
steals medicine

25:58.641 --> 26:00.642
that turns out
wouldn't help anyway.

26:01.894 --> 26:05.605
Gets floated for it
and...

26:05.814 --> 26:08.483
His mother,
she starts drinking

26:08.692 --> 26:10.902
pretty heavily
after that and...

26:13.489 --> 26:15.615
Last words
she says to him

26:15.824 --> 26:19.077
before he finds her in
a pool of her own vomit

26:19.286 --> 26:20.245
is that...

26:26.377 --> 26:27.961
Is that he killed
his father.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.261
Boo-hoo.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.239
You have to stand
on your feet.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.407
He'll kill you
if you don't.

27:01.912 --> 27:04.497
We're warriors.
We're warriors.

27:06.166 --> 27:09.294
We're warriors.
We are warriors.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.162
We're here now.

27:46.540 --> 27:47.665
Everything's gonna
be OK.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.062
Don't stand up.

28:09.271 --> 28:10.396
I'm fine.
We need to get

28:10.606 --> 28:11.814
back to
the dropship.

28:12.024 --> 28:15.526
Hey. Where's Clarke?
Is she all right?

28:15.736 --> 28:16.569
She was
when we left.

28:17.988 --> 28:18.821
We'll take you to her.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.616
Wait. Slow down.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.242
Sinclair.

28:23.452 --> 28:24.702
We're splitting up.

28:24.912 --> 28:27.372
One guard detail
comes with me to the dropship.

28:27.581 --> 28:29.791
Everyone else here
goes with you to Alpha station.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
You have the coordinates.
We'll follow

28:31.210 --> 28:32.377
as soon as we can.
Yes, sir.

28:34.004 --> 28:35.588
Anything more
from Jaha?

28:36.757 --> 28:38.299
No. Nothing
in the past hour.

28:40.678 --> 28:43.471
OK.
You six with me.

28:43.681 --> 28:44.931
You two,
lead the way.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.140
All right, let's go.
Come on.

28:46.350 --> 28:47.767
We're on the move.
Let's go.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.102
You're almost
there, Abby.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.858
Al laik Okteivia kom skai kru
en Al gaf gouthru Klir.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.568
Once more.
Come on, say it.

28:57.778 --> 28:58.903
Come on.

28:59.113 --> 29:01.072
Al laik Okteivia
kom skal--

29:01.281 --> 29:02.573
you know, you still
haven't even

29:02.783 --> 29:03.908
told me where
we're going.

29:06.704 --> 29:08.496
Can't you smell it?

29:08.706 --> 29:09.664
We're almost
to the sea.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.376
No, I can't
smell anything.

29:15.212 --> 29:16.212
Lincoln,
I'm scared.

29:28.517 --> 29:29.434
It's too quiet.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.357
We'll take it
from here.

29:36.567 --> 29:40.027
Banks, Scanlon,
you stay with them.

29:40.237 --> 29:41.612
We'll signal once
we're sure it's safe.

29:57.588 --> 29:58.588
Help her.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.925
Raven. Raven.

30:03.135 --> 30:06.053
Raven.
Raven, honey, it's Abby.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.391
Clarke's not here.

30:13.228 --> 30:14.562
I don't know
where she is.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.278
What happened to you?

30:30.662 --> 30:31.746
I got shot.

30:34.583 --> 30:35.416
I got shot.

30:37.586 --> 30:38.920
We need a stretcher!

30:39.129 --> 30:40.671
Sir.

30:40.881 --> 30:41.839
Whoa,
whoa, whoa.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.221
Hey,
hold it right there.

30:48.430 --> 30:49.680
Get back here!

30:52.851 --> 30:53.684
Uhh.

30:57.231 --> 30:58.189
Where is everyone?

31:03.320 --> 31:06.906
It was awful.
There was hundreds of them.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.242
There was hundreds
of them and if it wasn't for raven--

31:09.451 --> 31:11.369
uhh--I don't know
what happened.

31:14.331 --> 31:18.543
Bellamy. You're...
You're alive.

31:18.752 --> 31:21.921
Aah! You murdering
son of a bitch!

31:24.716 --> 31:25.800
Stop, ...!

31:36.895 --> 31:38.062
Place him under arrest.

31:39.439 --> 31:41.190
Wait.
You don't understand.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.025
Murphy murdered
two of our people.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.944
He shot another one.
He tried to hang Bellamy.

31:45.153 --> 31:47.655
I don't care.
You are not animals.

31:49.533 --> 31:50.533
There are rules.

31:52.619 --> 31:53.619
Laws.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.331
You are not
in control here anymore.

32:04.923 --> 32:05.756
Raven.

32:12.139 --> 32:13.347
She's lost
a lot of blood.

32:13.557 --> 32:15.558
It's a miracle that
she's still alive.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.315
There's no one else
in there.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.485
Come on.
Put her down over here.

32:46.340 --> 32:49.508
...now sleep.

32:51.178 --> 32:52.929
Be back with the antidote
as soon as I can.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.564
You brought me
to your village?

33:05.025 --> 33:06.025
I won't let you die.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.989
Lincoln...Lincoln...

33:12.199 --> 33:13.616
Hey, hey.
They'll kill you.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.494
Hey. Only if
they catch me.

33:17.704 --> 33:18.746
Stay alive.

33:20.874 --> 33:21.874
And stay quiet.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.568
Lose the handcuffs.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.412
There's a blank canvas
if you'd like.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.293
I used to paint
the ground, too.

34:06.503 --> 34:08.671
It's not just
the ground.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.172
It's a memory.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.301
You've been outside?

34:14.511 --> 34:18.431
Yes. 56 years ago.

34:18.640 --> 34:20.808
For 5 minutes.

34:21.018 --> 34:22.935
I was 7
when the first of

34:23.145 --> 34:25.271
what we call
the outsiders appeared.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.439
Before that, we thought

34:26.648 --> 34:29.108
we were all there was.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.861
Imagine our surprise.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.696
I don't have to imagine.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.407
My father, this was
his office at the time,

34:36.616 --> 34:38.117
believed it meant
that the earth

34:38.326 --> 34:40.036
was survivable again,

34:40.245 --> 34:41.871
and so, he opened
the doors.

34:43.373 --> 34:47.168
Within a week,
54 people were dead

34:47.377 --> 34:48.794
from the exposure.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.548
My mother and sister
among them.

34:57.095 --> 35:02.183
Loss...Pain, regret.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.229
Time eases
these things, Clarke,

35:07.439 --> 35:09.732
but the only time
it's ever truly gone is

35:09.941 --> 35:10.941
when I'm painting.

35:16.073 --> 35:18.115
You didn't bring me here
to talk about painting.

35:18.992 --> 35:19.825
Did you?

35:21.620 --> 35:23.788
I'm afraid I have
bad news.

35:23.997 --> 35:25.956
Our patrols have
swept the area

35:26.166 --> 35:27.917
and found no evidence
of survivors,

35:28.126 --> 35:30.252
either at your camp
or from the ark.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.171
How can they be sure?

35:32.380 --> 35:33.422
They can't.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.424
I've ordered them
to keep searching.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.634
I need to see
for myself.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.010
I'm sorry.
I can't allow that.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.137
I'm doing this
for your own good, Clarke.

35:40.347 --> 35:42.139
It's not safe
out there.

35:42.349 --> 35:43.933
Radiation has
no effect on us.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.268
It's not the radiation
I'm concerned about.

35:48.772 --> 35:51.565
You need
time to grieve.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.235
These men will show you
to your room.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.529
And if I try to leave?

35:56.738 --> 35:58.322
Please don't
test me, Clarke.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.210
We're leaving.
What?

36:11.419 --> 36:12.545
This is where
they'll come back.

36:12.754 --> 36:13.754
I don't think
they're coming back.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.134
The grounders took them
and you know that.

36:21.221 --> 36:24.723
Look...We go with Kane
to Alpha station,

36:24.933 --> 36:27.768
we get
reinforcements, weapons,

36:27.978 --> 36:29.603
then we find
our friends.

36:29.813 --> 36:31.021
One question.

36:31.231 --> 36:32.815
How many more of us
will be dead by then?

36:39.823 --> 36:41.282
Abby says raven
needs surgery

36:41.491 --> 36:42.366
or she's gonna die.

36:46.288 --> 36:47.163
It's time to go.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.506
Abby? Let's get
ready to move out.

37:01.303 --> 37:02.595
We gotta get there
before dark.

37:15.901 --> 37:19.153
For the past
and the future we serve.

37:19.362 --> 37:20.946
We give thanks.

37:21.156 --> 37:26.410
Good health, good food,
and good company.

37:26.620 --> 37:29.538
And the blessing of new friends.

37:29.748 --> 37:30.873
We give thanks.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.328
Abby.

39:37.959 --> 39:40.127
Treat the critically wounded
first. Everyone else can wait.

39:49.888 --> 39:50.763
Was that your idea?

39:50.972 --> 39:51.764
Yes, sir.

39:54.017 --> 39:54.975
It's a good idea.

39:58.021 --> 39:59.146
Have we heard
from him?

39:59.356 --> 40:00.939
No, sir.

40:01.149 --> 40:02.316
Still radio silence.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.404
Well, you're gonna
brief me, then.

40:08.281 --> 40:10.115
Yes, sir.

40:10.325 --> 40:11.450
Mr. chancellor.

40:17.916 --> 40:22.503
Sinclair, if you can
hear me and can't respond.

40:22.712 --> 40:25.631
It has been 12 hours
since our last contact.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.968
The air up here is
holding up better than I am.

40:30.178 --> 40:32.679
Time for me to face the fact
that I can't help you anymore.

40:32.889 --> 40:33.806
My job is done.

40:38.686 --> 40:39.812
I am so tired.

40:44.234 --> 40:45.776
Tell Kane and Abby...

40:47.529 --> 40:50.030
They're on their--they're
on their own now.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.282
As long as they work together,
everything will be OK.

40:52.492 --> 40:54.535
You remind them of that.

40:54.744 --> 40:57.371
You tell them to keep
our people safe.

41:04.045 --> 41:05.087
Jaha out.

41:23.398 --> 41:24.565
May we meet again.
