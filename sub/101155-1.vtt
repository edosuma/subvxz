WEBVTT

00:31.365 --> 00:32.908
[Man] You've got to do
something.

00:32.992 --> 00:34.952
[Hogan] Why have I
got to do something?

00:35.035 --> 00:37.329
[Man] Because I don't
really like snakes!

00:37.413 --> 00:39.081
[Hogan] I don't like 'em either.

00:39.165 --> 00:41.375
Why don't we just
turn around and...

00:41.459 --> 00:43.419
go back the way we came up?

00:44.879 --> 00:46.756
'Cause everyone's watching.

00:49.175 --> 00:51.260
Please. Mr. Dundee.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.344
Oh...

00:52.428 --> 00:55.097
Yeah, come on. Mr. Dundee.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.354
[Man] Go, Dundee!

01:02.438 --> 01:05.566
[Hogan] I'm not really
Crocodile Dundee, you know.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.526
Just a character I play
in a movie.

01:07.610 --> 01:11.489
He's being modest. That movie
was practically a documentary.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.823
[Hogan] Shut up, Barney!

01:12.907 --> 01:15.242
Stand back, everyone. Boys.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.953
Oh. Shit.

01:19.038 --> 01:20.289
Be careful.

01:20.372 --> 01:21.916
[Barney] Here's a stick!

01:21.999 --> 01:23.042
[stick whooshes]

01:31.842 --> 01:34.970
He'll have that thing on the
barbecue tonight. [chuckles]

01:42.061 --> 01:44.313
It's dead. [chuckles]

01:44.396 --> 01:46.190
[laughs]

01:48.567 --> 01:50.611
[Teacher] Um, yeah, not that
one.

01:50.694 --> 01:51.612
Huh?

01:51.695 --> 01:53.572
Could you get the other one?

01:53.656 --> 01:55.115
The other one? Oh, is there...

01:55.199 --> 01:56.075
Ooh, Jesus!

01:57.952 --> 01:59.119
Shit.

01:59.203 --> 02:00.496
Everything okay?

02:00.579 --> 02:01.580
[snake hisses]

02:01.664 --> 02:03.332
[screams]

02:03.415 --> 02:05.501
[All clamoring]

02:12.633 --> 02:13.968
Oops.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.886
[screaming continues]

02:17.763 --> 02:21.433
As hilarious reports
continue to surface of Paul

02:21.517 --> 02:23.227
'Crocodile Dundee' Hogan's

02:23.310 --> 02:25.396
ill-fated rendezvous
with a snake...

02:25.479 --> 02:29.316
we ask where the Man from
Down Under has been hiding.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.652
[Man] The one-time rigger
on the Sydney Harbor Bridge

02:31.735 --> 02:33.153
first got his big break

02:33.237 --> 02:36.115
on Australian talent show
New Faces.

02:36.198 --> 02:39.493
[Woman] He instantly became
a household favorite,

02:39.577 --> 02:42.204
and quickly, this everyman
went on to star

02:42.288 --> 02:46.166
in his own sketch comedy
series, The Paul Hogan Show.

02:46.250 --> 02:50.504
[Man] Dominating the Australian
ratings over a 14-year period

02:50.588 --> 02:53.340
made 'Hoges' a household name

02:53.424 --> 02:58.095
and introduced such iconic
characters as Arthur Dunger,

02:58.178 --> 03:00.014
Luigi the Unbelievable

03:00.097 --> 03:03.893
and stuntman extraordinaire
Leo Wanker.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.771
The world beckoned,
and as Hoges fronted

03:07.855 --> 03:10.441
Australia's most successful
tourism campaign,

03:10.524 --> 03:14.278
we booked our flights and
flocked Down Under in droves.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.280
It was then Hogan unleashed...

03:16.363 --> 03:19.575
the most successful
independent film

03:19.658 --> 03:21.535
in the history of cinema...

03:21.619 --> 03:23.370
[Man] Crocodile Dundee.

03:23.454 --> 03:25.205
[O'DELL] ...Crocodile Dundee,
of course.

03:25.289 --> 03:26.874
[Woman] ...Crocodile Dundee.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.042
That's not a knife.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.546
That's a knife.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.298
[Woman] The low-budget Aussie
comedy

03:34.381 --> 03:37.760
went on to gross over $300
million worldwide

03:37.843 --> 03:41.889
and saw Paul Hogan co-host
the 1987 Academy Awards

03:41.972 --> 03:44.767
and made him one of the most
recognizable faces

03:44.850 --> 03:47.394
on the planet and a national
treasure.

03:47.478 --> 03:49.730
Growing up in Australia,
there was one name

03:49.813 --> 03:53.192
that was...beyond an idol
in a way,

03:53.275 --> 03:56.570
and I'm just gonna say
one word - Hoges.

03:56.654 --> 03:57.780
[cheering and applause]

03:57.863 --> 03:59.323
Hoges was your everyman.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.200
Hoges was the Aussie
you wanted to be.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.994
[O'Dell] In 1989 came Dundee II

04:04.078 --> 04:06.872
and saw Hogan move
to live in the US.

04:06.956 --> 04:08.749
[Frazier] More films were
to follow,

04:08.832 --> 04:10.918
but all failed to capture
the same success

04:11.001 --> 04:12.461
as Crocodile Dundee.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.171
[Man] And almost overnight,

04:14.254 --> 04:16.714
Hogan disappeared from
American screens.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.300
And apart from a brief cameo

04:18.384 --> 04:20.511
in a new Australian
tourism campaign...

04:20.594 --> 04:22.638
...has rarely been seen again.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.056
[Woman] If you want to know

04:24.139 --> 04:25.557
what the notoriously private
star

04:25.641 --> 04:27.810
has been up to these past
20 years,

04:27.893 --> 04:31.563
your guess...is as good as
mine.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.357
[Woman] What the hell was that?!

04:33.440 --> 04:34.692
[Hogan] What?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.235
You threw a snake at a
fifth-grade teacher

04:36.318 --> 04:37.903
and hit her in the face!

04:37.987 --> 04:40.781
Oh. Oh, she thought I was
the real Crocodile Dundee.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.616
So you threw a snake at her?

04:42.700 --> 04:45.661
Oh, no. That was an accident.
The bloody thing leapt at me.

04:45.744 --> 04:48.747
Right. And yet she thought you
were the real Crocodile Dundee?

04:48.831 --> 04:50.791
[laughs] Yeah. He probably
would have eaten it.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.002
Paul, I hardly have any clients
left as it is.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.920
Could you just please try
not to kill yourself?

04:55.004 --> 04:55.921
Okay.

04:56.005 --> 04:56.922
Thank you.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.090
Uh, where are we going?

04:58.173 --> 04:59.591
Oh. I have news.

04:59.675 --> 05:00.592
Oh.

05:00.676 --> 05:01.552
Yeah!

05:06.473 --> 05:07.433
See this letter?

05:07.516 --> 05:08.559
What?

05:08.642 --> 05:11.061
Well, God knows why,
but apparently

05:11.145 --> 05:15.399
the Queen of England wants to
bestow you with a knighthood.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.400
[laughs]

05:16.483 --> 05:17.401
What for?

05:17.484 --> 05:18.736
For services to comedy.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.488
Services! God! I don't want
a knighthood.

05:21.572 --> 05:22.948
Well, you're getting one.

05:23.032 --> 05:24.783
So this is serious?

05:24.867 --> 05:26.535
Oh. Look at that.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.579
There's that Dundee
impersonator.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.330
[Hogan] Oh, he's still here.
[chuckles]

05:30.414 --> 05:32.750
I hate it. You know, people keep
telling me he's strung out.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.544
Photo with Mick Dundee?
Hey? Crocodile man?

05:35.627 --> 05:37.129
[Hogan] They're all strung out.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.256
Yeah, but he doesn't even
look like Dundee!

05:39.339 --> 05:41.133
And apparently he's rude
to the kids

05:41.216 --> 05:43.052
and then charges them
something like $5

05:43.135 --> 05:44.344
just to take his picture.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.472
Well, this is Hollywood
Boulevard.

05:46.555 --> 05:47.723
They're all crooks.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.016
Yeah, I know.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.018
Oh, and, yes, this is very
serious.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.603
Oh.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.981
Oh, yeah. They want me
to appear in person.

05:56.065 --> 05:57.483
Six weeks from now in London.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.651
[laughs] I know!
How great is that?

05:59.735 --> 06:01.403
[scoffs] I'm not going.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.072
Wait. But... What? You are.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.865
Wh-why would I go to...

06:04.948 --> 06:07.034
I mean, I've been trying to
retire for the last 20 years.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.077
I know.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.578
[Hogan] You know me. I'm lazy.

06:09.661 --> 06:12.164
I like to stay at home
and watch Ellen on TV

06:12.247 --> 06:13.957
and do crossword puzzles.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.876
But despite all that, it seems

06:15.959 --> 06:18.253
the Queen is actually
quite the fan.

06:18.337 --> 06:19.254
Oh.

06:19.338 --> 06:20.297
[laughs] I know.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.840
I'm not surprised.

06:21.924 --> 06:24.218
I mean, come on, you put
Australia on the map.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.720
You had the most successful
independent film

06:26.804 --> 06:28.388
in history, Paul.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.140
I mean, you've got to think
about your legacy.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.475
My legacy?

06:31.558 --> 06:34.061
Having a legacy is a beautiful
thing.

06:34.144 --> 06:37.898
As your manager, I am telling
you, you've got to do this.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.983
Oh, and in the meantime,

06:40.067 --> 06:41.610
can you just try and
behave yourself?

06:41.693 --> 06:43.946
Because, you know, the palace
hates any kind of...

06:44.029 --> 06:45.864
controversy or trouble.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.659
Hey, I never cause any
controversy or trouble.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.663
You know...sometimes it...
just comes after me.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.669
[Hogan] What are we doing here?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.379
[Angie] Okay. Don't be mad.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.548
But the studio really, really
wanted a meeting.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.299
[Hogan] Angie, I've been
telling you for 20 years,

07:04.383 --> 07:06.051
I don't want to do
another Dundee.

07:06.135 --> 07:09.012
I know, but they've got some
really amazing casting news.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.682
Seriously, I have never
heard the studio

07:11.765 --> 07:13.559
this excited and bursting
with ideas.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.811
So I told them we'd take
a meeting.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.605
Oh, come on. Just do it for me?
Please?

07:18.689 --> 07:20.274
Can we meet with them?

07:20.357 --> 07:22.860
And then you can go home,
take a nap and watch Ellen.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.528
[chuckles]

07:24.611 --> 07:25.529
All right. Come on.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.406
Okay. You know what? I can't go.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.533
I've got to meet Mom.
But you go ahead.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.118
You'll be great, trust me.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.452
I'll call you later!

07:32.536 --> 07:35.664
[starts engine] Love you!
[cackles]

07:35.747 --> 07:38.959
Oh, look! Everyone,
there's Paul Hogan!

07:53.682 --> 07:54.600
Hey.

07:54.683 --> 07:55.601
Hey, Paul.

07:55.684 --> 07:56.810
Kim Courtney. Pleasure.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.228
Paul, it's an honor.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.023
Thanks for coming in, Paul.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.941
We heard you were very excited
to meet.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.568
Uh...yeah.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.153
Let me just start by saying
that we are huge fans

08:06.236 --> 08:07.988
of the Crocodile Dundee movies.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.615
And we want to bring him back.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.200
We know you've been a little
resistant in the past,

08:11.283 --> 08:12.951
but please, just hear us out.

08:13.035 --> 08:16.330
We'd really love to see
Dundee...

08:16.413 --> 08:17.915
come to Los Angeles.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.374
[Hogan] Dundee in LA?

08:19.458 --> 08:20.375
Exactly.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.294
Like we did in Dundee III?

08:23.629 --> 08:25.380
There was a Dundee III?

08:25.464 --> 08:26.798
Are you sure?

08:26.882 --> 08:28.884
Mmm, reasonably.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.344
Here we go.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.011
Drinks! Ha ha!

08:32.095 --> 08:34.932
One sunrise kiss
with added kale.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.475
Thank you.

08:36.558 --> 08:37.851
Roland, blended oats
and chai supreme.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.019
Ah. Thank you, Anton.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.354
Ah, Josh.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.480
Yes, siree.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.606
Lemon and rocket essence.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.607
Perfecto.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.608
Now, Paul...

08:44.691 --> 08:45.609
Uh, no, I'm...

08:45.692 --> 08:46.944
I made you my favorite,

08:47.027 --> 08:48.320
which is a cleansing blend

08:48.403 --> 08:50.072
of mint, goat's milk,

08:50.155 --> 08:54.868
activated walnuts and baby
spinach with agave syrup.

08:54.952 --> 08:56.036
Ooh!

08:56.119 --> 08:57.037
Agave syrup!

08:57.120 --> 08:58.038
Yeah. Thanks.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.081
[Kim] Take a sip.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.165
[Roland] Yeah, yeah. Drink.

09:00.249 --> 09:01.166
Sip.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.251
[Kim] Come on.

09:03.418 --> 09:04.336
Hmm? Hmm?

09:04.419 --> 09:05.837
It's good, huh?

09:05.921 --> 09:06.838
Yeah. There it is.

09:06.922 --> 09:07.839
[laughter]

09:07.923 --> 09:09.174
Anton!

09:09.258 --> 09:12.135
Okay. Let's forget the location.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.679
We want to introduce your son.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.430
A Dundee Jr.

09:15.514 --> 09:18.558
You know, someone who shares all
of your qualities and attributes

09:18.642 --> 09:20.477
but who can bring the franchise
forward

09:20.560 --> 09:22.145
for a younger, new generation.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.523
Yeah, well, we've already been
down that road,

09:24.606 --> 09:27.317
and it, um... didn't sort of
work.

09:27.401 --> 09:30.028
Yes. But this time, we have
just the actor.

09:30.112 --> 09:32.614
He's A-list, he is charming,
funny as hell...

09:32.698 --> 09:33.657
A little bit cute.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.700
He is perfect.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.744
And a massive, massive fan.

09:37.828 --> 09:41.331
So, without any further ado,
to play your son...

09:42.582 --> 09:43.709
Will Smith!

09:43.792 --> 09:44.710
[Others laugh]

09:47.170 --> 09:49.589
Look at him! Oh, he can't
believe it!

09:49.673 --> 09:52.301
Believe it, Paul!
He wants to play your son!

09:52.384 --> 09:53.510
Yeah!

09:53.593 --> 09:54.678
Yeah, but...

09:54.761 --> 09:56.972
Okay. We know what you're
thinking.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.223
He's too old.

09:58.307 --> 09:59.891
No, that's not what I'm
thinking.

09:59.975 --> 10:02.436
But he's just turned 50
and he looks great.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.854
Yeah, I'm sure, yeah, but...

10:03.937 --> 10:05.105
What? He's American?

10:05.188 --> 10:06.315
He's fantastic with accents.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.441
We'll get him a voice coach.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.151
But that's...not the problem.

Well, it just doesn't
make sense.

10:28.378 --> 10:29.338

10:29.421 --> 10:30.505

You don't seem too sure
about Will... What is it?

10:45.062 --> 10:45.979
You can tell us.

10:46.063 --> 10:46.980
Mmm.

10:54.780 --> 10:55.697
No, I...I love Will Smith.

10:55.781 --> 10:56.823

11:10.921 --> 11:12.547
Paul, not more than
20 minutes ago,

11:12.631 --> 11:14.049
I told you to behave yourself,

11:14.132 --> 11:15.550

to become a racist?

11:15.634 --> 11:17.761
Racist? Oh, rubbish!

11:17.844 --> 11:19.971
They said you said you didn't
like Will Smith

11:20.055 --> 11:21.306
because he was black.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.100
No! I just said it makes
no sense

11:23.183 --> 11:25.435
that me and the equally white
Sue Charlton

11:25.519 --> 11:27.562
have an African-American son.

God, Paul! You can't say that!

11:31.316 --> 11:33.402
Oh, I'm fairly sure I already
did.

11:33.485 --> 11:36.446
Now I know why my dad always
wanted to quit managing you.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.032
He never wanted to quit.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.575
Paul?

11:40.659 --> 11:42.160
Um, what do you say

11:42.244 --> 11:44.621
we just keep this Will Smith
stuff to ourselves, huh?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.415
And you just try and behave.

11:46.498 --> 11:47.707
I'll try.

11:47.791 --> 11:48.708
Okay.

39:42.255 --> 39:43.423
Look, it was an accident.

39:43.507 --> 39:45.842
Okay. So, just so I get this
right

39:45.926 --> 39:47.761
when I call the palace,

39:47.844 --> 39:51.098
you, um, threw a deadly snake
at a fifth-grade teacher,

39:51.181 --> 39:53.433
insulted an African-American
superstar,

39:53.517 --> 39:55.102
attempted to beat up
two children,

39:55.185 --> 39:56.686
offended the entire
black community

39:56.770 --> 39:58.230
and knocked out a nun?

39:58.313 --> 39:59.564
What am I forgetting here?

39:59.648 --> 40:01.149
Why are you calling the palace?

40:01.233 --> 40:03.443
I'm calling the palace
to cancel the knighthood!

40:03.527 --> 40:07.197
Before they find out about you
and do it for us.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.367
Paul, I am trying
to get out of this

40:10.450 --> 40:13.578
with a teeny-tiny amount
of dignity.

40:13.662 --> 40:15.914
[Hogan chuckles]

40:15.997 --> 40:17.999
Okay, what time is it
in London right now?

40:18.083 --> 40:21.628
Uh, no. Don't call the palace.
Don't cancel the knighthood.

40:21.711 --> 40:23.088
I promised Lucy.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.548
Okay, fine. Fine.

40:24.631 --> 40:26.758
I'm just...I'm amazed
that the media

40:26.842 --> 40:28.802
hasn't picked up on this story
yet.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.304
And thank God she's okay.
This woman, this, um, Sister...

40:31.388 --> 40:32.973
Mary Murphy.

40:33.056 --> 40:34.015
Mary Murphy.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.600
And do you know why

40:35.684 --> 40:37.686
the media hasn't picked up
on the story yet?

40:37.769 --> 40:42.732
Because I have been up since 2am
calling every contact I know.

40:42.816 --> 40:44.192
I...

40:44.276 --> 40:45.569
Are you even listening to me?

40:45.652 --> 40:47.154
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

40:47.237 --> 40:48.905
What are you... Hey!

40:48.989 --> 40:50.782
I have been up all night
calling in favors,

40:50.866 --> 40:52.409
a lot of which I am
really not proud of,

40:52.492 --> 40:54.411
all so they wouldn't run
this story!

40:54.494 --> 40:57.038
Oh, yeah. Look, I appreciate
that too.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.707
But I was thinking, um,

40:58.790 --> 41:01.209
why don't you try and get me
on some of the tonight shows?

41:01.293 --> 41:02.919
What? No! No.

41:03.003 --> 41:06.047
Forget the tonight shows.
They're not interested.

41:06.131 --> 41:09.301
And, Paul, why do you want to
draw more attention to yourself?

41:10.468 --> 41:11.761
Okay, I'll tell you what.

41:11.845 --> 41:14.890
I will hold off
on calling the palace

41:14.973 --> 41:17.225
if you agree to have lunch

41:17.309 --> 41:19.603
with someone who is willing
to get you off the front pages.

41:19.686 --> 41:21.396
Who?

41:21.479 --> 41:24.399
A decent, respectable,
dignified man.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.817
Oh. Some actor.

41:25.901 --> 41:28.695
No, an acrobat. Yes, an actor!

41:28.778 --> 41:31.531
Look, I don't want to have
lunch with some actor.

41:31.615 --> 41:33.241
I don't have lunch with anybody.

41:33.325 --> 41:35.911
Well, if you don't want me
to cancel the knighthood,

41:35.994 --> 41:37.329
you're going.

41:37.412 --> 41:40.165
I mean, he's willing
to sit down with you

41:40.248 --> 41:44.377
and spend time to explain
what it's like to be respectful

41:44.461 --> 41:46.671
and...and someone...who...

41:50.550 --> 41:52.260
You're on TV right now,
aren't you?

41:55.305 --> 41:56.973
How bad is it?

41:57.057 --> 41:59.309
Uh...

41:59.392 --> 42:02.354
Yeah, Okay, so, where am I gonna
have lunch with this guy?

42:02.437 --> 42:03.939
Oh, God.

42:07.108 --> 42:09.361
[jazz piano playing]

42:15.492 --> 42:17.160
Paul!

42:17.953 --> 42:19.537
Oh. Chevy.

42:22.123 --> 42:23.875
Ah. Oh.

42:23.959 --> 42:25.585
This is, uh, pretty nice.

42:25.669 --> 42:28.421
Oh, yeah. Nice atmosphere,
great food.

42:28.505 --> 42:30.298
Can I take...

42:31.424 --> 42:32.592
Oh, my goodness!

42:32.676 --> 42:33.635
Oh!

42:33.718 --> 42:34.719
Lovely to meet you.

42:34.803 --> 42:36.221
Oh! [giggles]

42:36.304 --> 42:37.639
I just have to say,

42:37.722 --> 42:39.641
watching you perform
on Saturday Night Live

42:39.724 --> 42:41.268
made me want to become
a comedian. [giggles]

42:41.351 --> 42:43.520
Oh. How's that working out
for you?

42:43.603 --> 42:47.107
Well, I'm working here as
a waitress, so...not so great.

42:47.190 --> 42:49.442
Well, it takes intense training.

42:49.526 --> 42:53.488
But still, um...can I please
buy you a drink on the house?

42:53.571 --> 42:54.948
Oh, that'd be lovely.

42:55.031 --> 42:58.410
How about a glass, um...
Brown Brothers SMC?

42:58.493 --> 43:01.454
Oh, I love it. I love it.
Paul, would you...

43:01.538 --> 43:03.581
Yeah, I'll...I'll have
the same, thanks.

43:04.916 --> 43:07.294
You are aware that is $40
a glass?

43:07.377 --> 43:09.296
Sure.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.217
You...do know who this is?

43:14.301 --> 43:15.552
Yep.

43:18.179 --> 43:20.598
Wow. You've really been through
the wars, haven't you?

43:20.682 --> 43:22.017
[Chevy laughs]

43:22.100 --> 43:24.102
Nah, it's fine. It's just,
my manager...

43:24.185 --> 43:25.895
People ask me constantly,

43:25.979 --> 43:28.106
how is it that I'm so loved
and adored?

43:28.189 --> 43:30.025
And, you know, it's actually
quite easy.

43:30.108 --> 43:31.735
How?

43:31.818 --> 43:34.571
Just win an Oscar.

43:34.654 --> 43:36.197
Ah.

43:36.281 --> 43:38.533
Wh...what did you win
an Oscar for?

43:38.616 --> 43:40.910
Caddyshack. First one.

43:40.994 --> 43:42.370
Uh-huh.

43:42.454 --> 43:43.496
Yeah.

43:43.580 --> 43:44.748
You win one of those suckers,

43:44.831 --> 43:46.041
you can do just about anything.

43:46.124 --> 43:47.500
Really?

43:48.668 --> 43:50.295
[plate smashes]

43:51.171 --> 43:52.339
Huh.

43:52.422 --> 43:53.506
Are you okay, Mr. Chase?

43:53.590 --> 43:55.175
Yes. You need to have these
fixed.

43:55.258 --> 43:57.510
It just slid right off
the table.

43:58.470 --> 43:59.846
Certainly.

43:59.929 --> 44:02.807
I'll talk to the owner
about...gluing them on.

44:06.978 --> 44:11.232
Um, listen. I was nominated
for an Academy Award once.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.401
Really? What for?

44:13.485 --> 44:15.487
Couldn't have been acting.
No offense.

44:15.570 --> 44:19.532
It was for writing.
Best Screenplay.

44:19.616 --> 44:21.743
Writing! Wow.

44:21.826 --> 44:23.870
I didn't know that was still
a category.

44:23.953 --> 44:26.247
What's next, Best Catering?
[chuckles]

44:26.331 --> 44:28.249
Ooh! Excuse me, Mr. Chase.

44:28.333 --> 44:30.835
I am so sorry to interrupt you,
but I just have to say,

44:30.919 --> 44:33.880
you were hilarious
in The Three Amigos.

44:33.963 --> 44:35.715
Whoa! Blew me away.

44:35.799 --> 44:40.178
Oh, and European Vacation?
You are an amazing man!

44:40.261 --> 44:42.722
Oh, come on, now.
You're being silly.

44:42.806 --> 44:43.807
[giggles]

44:43.890 --> 44:45.141
We're all just human beings.

44:45.225 --> 44:46.851
I'm exactly like you.

44:46.935 --> 44:48.186
Except for the Oscar.

44:50.271 --> 44:51.773
You have an Oscar?

44:51.856 --> 44:53.066
Maybe.

44:55.944 --> 44:57.612
Mm-hm.

44:57.695 --> 44:58.905
She's cute.

44:58.988 --> 45:00.657
Yeah.

45:00.740 --> 45:02.659
Chevy! Are we still on
for badminton?

45:02.742 --> 45:04.035
Absolutely.

45:04.119 --> 45:06.329
And, Paul. How are you?

45:06.413 --> 45:08.206
Oh. I'm good.

45:08.289 --> 45:09.457
Great.

45:09.541 --> 45:11.292
We've actually been
meaning to call.

45:11.376 --> 45:14.629
We've had a good think, and
whilst we know you're not keen,

45:14.712 --> 45:17.799
if you'd just put on the hat
one last time,

45:17.882 --> 45:20.427
we have a killer idea.

45:20.510 --> 45:21.845
Oh.

45:21.928 --> 45:25.432
[Barry] Dundee is angry.
Why is he angry?

45:25.515 --> 45:28.476
Wait for it-- His wife,
Sue, is dead.

45:28.560 --> 45:29.769
Dead?

45:29.853 --> 45:31.271
Eaten by a crocodile.

45:31.354 --> 45:33.064
You want revenge.

45:33.148 --> 45:35.525
You enlist the help of a
gorgeous young park ranger

45:35.608 --> 45:37.444
and boom! New love interest.

45:37.527 --> 45:39.320
Sounds great. Sounds great.

45:39.404 --> 45:41.656
You want to know who plays
the gorgeous park ranger?

45:41.739 --> 45:43.450
Rachel McAdams!

45:43.533 --> 45:44.826
Wow!

45:44.909 --> 45:46.202
As the love interest.

45:46.286 --> 45:47.579
[Hogan] Rachel McAdams?

45:47.662 --> 45:49.414
[chuckles] No.

45:49.497 --> 45:51.374
Oh, come on. You don't like
Rachel McAdams?

45:51.458 --> 45:52.792
I love Rachel McAdams.

45:52.876 --> 45:54.836
She's great. Okay?

45:54.919 --> 45:58.089
I'm bloody 80. She's, what, 30?

45:59.966 --> 46:01.217
He does have a point.

46:01.301 --> 46:02.594
He's right.

46:02.677 --> 46:03.720
She's too old.

46:03.803 --> 46:05.138
No, that's not what I'm...

46:05.221 --> 46:07.140
Do you have the list
for High School Musical?

46:07.223 --> 46:08.558
Yep.

46:09.559 --> 46:10.685
Selena Gomez!

46:10.768 --> 46:11.769
Emma Watson.

46:11.853 --> 46:13.104
Abigail Breslin!

46:13.188 --> 46:14.147
Yes!

46:14.230 --> 46:15.190
[laughs]

46:15.273 --> 46:16.900
No! No!

46:18.151 --> 46:19.652
You know something?

46:19.736 --> 46:22.405
You're actually being
very, very difficult.

46:22.489 --> 46:23.865
Oh.

46:23.948 --> 46:25.783
He does have a point.

46:25.867 --> 46:27.452
Mr. Chase.

46:27.535 --> 46:28.870
Paul.

46:28.953 --> 46:30.121
Yeah. [chuckles]

46:30.205 --> 46:31.873
Oh. So, yeah, thanks, Chevy.

46:31.956 --> 46:33.833
Oh, look at the time. Um...

46:33.917 --> 46:36.461
Yeah, I've got to leave, Chevy.
I've got an appointment.

46:36.544 --> 46:39.005
Oh, really? Uh... Check, please.

46:39.088 --> 46:40.632
Here. I'll fix it.

46:40.715 --> 46:42.175
No, don't be silly.

46:42.258 --> 46:43.927
Put that away. I've got this.

46:44.010 --> 46:44.928
Are you sure?

46:45.011 --> 46:46.554
Of course. My pleasure.

46:46.638 --> 46:48.765
With everything you have going
on, it's the least I can do.

46:50.016 --> 46:51.184
Yeah. Thanks.

46:51.267 --> 46:53.186
Good to see you.

46:54.687 --> 46:56.356
Thanks.

46:56.439 --> 46:57.732
Uh, excuse me?

46:58.983 --> 47:00.360
Was that Chevy Chase?

47:00.443 --> 47:02.195
Yep.

47:02.278 --> 47:04.489
[giggles] He's lovely!

47:04.572 --> 47:05.990
Uh, is he lovely?

47:06.074 --> 47:08.618
Oh, yeah, he's...
he's, uh, very nice. Yeah.

47:08.701 --> 47:10.954
[Woman] I knew he would be.

47:12.997 --> 47:14.791
Yep. [sighs]

47:16.251 --> 47:17.710
I love that guy.

47:17.794 --> 47:21.214
National Lampoon's Vacation.
Fantastic.

47:21.297 --> 47:24.092
[Man] Oi! He didn't pay
for his wine!

47:25.218 --> 47:26.803
[squeals]

47:26.886 --> 47:28.304
[Hogan groans]

47:34.936 --> 47:36.980
[Ryan on TV]: And that's all
from me, Ryan Elcar,

47:37.063 --> 47:38.565
and the team here at LA Local.

47:38.648 --> 47:40.441
Be sure to keep watching
throughout the evening

47:40.525 --> 47:42.110
for regular updates,

47:42.193 --> 47:45.238
and tune from 5am tomorrow
when Suzanne O'Reilly

47:45.321 --> 47:47.907
takes you through what
you missed overnight...

47:49.617 --> 47:53.371
[Chase] ♪ I gave my love
a cherry

47:53.454 --> 47:57.125
♪ That had no stone

47:57.208 --> 48:01.462

48:21.441 --> 48:24.027
[Man on TV]: Oh, yeah, I heard.
All right, look.

48:24.110 --> 48:26.404
When I first heard about
the snake incident,

48:26.487 --> 48:28.197
I was pretty upset,
'cause I thought

48:28.281 --> 48:29.616
Paul Hogan was already dead.

48:29.699 --> 48:31.075
He's been away so...

48:31.159 --> 48:32.702
I have to go on stage
every time and,

48:32.785 --> 48:34.746
"Is that a knife?
Is this not a knife?

48:34.829 --> 48:36.331
"Is that a microphone?"

48:36.414 --> 48:38.207
[Man] When asked about
their close friendship,

48:38.291 --> 48:39.959
the Oscar-winner Gary Oldman

48:40.043 --> 48:41.753
denied ever meeting
the troubled star...

48:41.836 --> 48:43.588
Am I allowed to say
"[bleep]-wit"?

48:43.671 --> 48:44.714
He's a [bleep...

48:44.797 --> 48:46.174
[Woman] Though, John Travolta

48:46.257 --> 48:47.508
refused to discuss Mr. Hogan.

48:47.592 --> 48:50.303
No. No. That's a very dangerous
thing.

48:50.386 --> 48:52.305
[Woman] However, he released
a statement:

48:52.388 --> 48:54.098
"I don't care what he does,

48:54.182 --> 48:56.017
"but the moment he stands
on stage with my Olivia

48:56.100 --> 48:59.979
"and tries to destroy our
legacy, he's gone too far."

49:01.356 --> 49:03.983
Hey. When did you learn
to play guitar?

49:04.067 --> 49:05.735
A couple of weeks ago.

49:05.818 --> 49:07.153
Course. [chuckles]

49:07.236 --> 49:08.279
You should come out.

49:08.363 --> 49:09.280
We're gonna have a barbie,

49:09.364 --> 49:10.281
play some more tunes.

49:10.365 --> 49:11.616
Okay.

49:11.699 --> 49:13.660
Oh, I've got a Spanish lesson
at 8.

49:13.743 --> 49:15.078
Make sure I don't forget,
all right?

49:15.161 --> 49:16.788
You're learning
to speak Spanish?

49:16.871 --> 49:18.706
No. Lo estoy enseñando.

49:20.667 --> 49:22.669
I'm not. I'm teaching it.

49:22.752 --> 49:24.712
[laughs] Of course you are.

49:24.796 --> 49:26.673
[laughs]

49:26.756 --> 49:30.009
TV: ..the little support
Paul Hogan did once have

49:30.093 --> 49:32.053
has disappeared completely.

49:32.136 --> 49:34.889
Dad, you know no-one thinks
this stuff, right?

49:34.972 --> 49:36.641
I hope not.

49:36.724 --> 49:38.017
[Reporter] ...gone off the
rails, right?

49:38.101 --> 49:39.727
I don't care what anyone says.
I love him.

49:39.811 --> 49:41.270
This is all right, though.

49:41.354 --> 49:42.563
I know he's had
a lot of criticism...

49:42.647 --> 49:44.273
Ooh. She loves you.

49:44.357 --> 49:45.566
[Both chuckle]

49:45.650 --> 49:48.277
[Chase] See? You'll be right.

49:48.361 --> 49:51.239
You know, when I was a kid, I
used to hide under the blankets

49:51.322 --> 49:53.700
when he wrestled those
crocodiles and snakes.

49:53.783 --> 49:56.869
And what about Bindi and Paul?
I mean...

49:56.953 --> 49:58.663
[Reporter] No...

49:58.746 --> 50:02.375
No, you're talking about Steve
Irwin, the Crocodile Hunter.

50:03.376 --> 50:04.919
Who did you ask about?

50:05.002 --> 50:07.880
[Reporter] Crocodile Dundee.
Paul Hogan.

50:07.964 --> 50:09.340
Oh, him.

50:09.424 --> 50:11.008
Yeah, he's a dickhead.

50:11.092 --> 50:12.844
[Man] All right, all right,
let me tell you

50:12.927 --> 50:14.804
what I think about
Mr. Paul Hogan...

50:14.887 --> 50:18.433
[Lucy] Grandpa, have you
ever had anyone not like you?

50:18.516 --> 50:23.062
[chuckles] Uh, oh, yeah, maybe
one or two people.

50:23.146 --> 50:24.814
What did you do?

50:24.897 --> 50:28.025
Well, nothing. You can't force
people to like you, love.

50:28.109 --> 50:30.862
Yeah, I mean,
when I started on television,

50:30.945 --> 50:32.947
one of my aunties
was saying to me,

50:33.030 --> 50:34.782
"Ooh, you shouldn't say that
on television,"

50:34.866 --> 50:36.951
or, "You shouldn't do this," or,
"You shouldn't look like that.

50:37.034 --> 50:38.536
"People won't like you."

50:38.619 --> 50:41.539
But, you know, some people
will like you, some won't.

50:41.622 --> 50:43.166
It's... You just be yourself.

50:43.249 --> 50:45.585
You mean I shouldn't let people
know you're my grandpa

50:45.668 --> 50:47.628
because you've been
upsetting them forever?

50:47.712 --> 50:49.589
[chuckles] Uh...

50:49.672 --> 50:52.216
Yeah, oh, well,
it's probably the safest thing

50:52.300 --> 50:53.718
just not to mention me.

50:53.801 --> 50:55.470
[chuckles]

50:55.553 --> 50:58.097
Listen, your mum said the new
school's a bit tough for you.

50:58.181 --> 50:59.891
Yeah.

50:59.974 --> 51:02.560
Oh, well, look, it's not easy
when you go to a new school,

51:02.643 --> 51:03.770
but you'll be fine.

51:03.853 --> 51:04.771
Yeah.

51:04.854 --> 51:05.980
Listen.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.940
I'm sorry if any of the stuff

51:08.024 --> 51:09.859
that's been reported about me

51:09.942 --> 51:12.320
makes it, uh...
a bit hard for you,

51:12.403 --> 51:14.489
but, you know,
just don't worry about it.

51:14.572 --> 51:15.990
You know, they make stuff up.

51:16.073 --> 51:18.493
That's not what Mum says!
[giggles]

51:18.576 --> 51:22.371
Oh, well...uh, Mum gets
confused sometimes.

51:22.455 --> 51:24.832
But don't worry, Grandpa.
You're getting a knighthood.

51:24.916 --> 51:27.835
That'll make up for all of it.
No-one can take that away.

51:27.919 --> 51:29.712
Oh, I hope not. [chuckles]

51:29.796 --> 51:31.839
Oh, I drew this.

51:34.008 --> 51:35.968
Ooh, did you do that?

51:36.052 --> 51:39.305
Oh, you're really talented
for a 19-year-old kid.

51:39.388 --> 51:41.557
[chuckles] I'm not 19, I'm 9!

51:41.641 --> 51:43.726
Oh, you can't be 9!
You're too smart.

51:43.810 --> 51:46.020
Thanks. But I just wanted
to show you that.

51:46.103 --> 51:47.230
[rattling outside]

51:47.313 --> 51:49.106
I'd better go. The Wizard
awaits.

51:49.190 --> 51:52.318
Oh. Yeah. Uh, how's that going?
How's that working out?

51:52.401 --> 51:55.988
Pretty good. I can't wait
for you to watch me sometime.

51:56.072 --> 51:57.240
Oh, I'd love to see it.

51:57.323 --> 51:58.241
[rattling]

51:58.324 --> 51:59.325
Bye, Pa.

51:59.408 --> 52:00.535
Yeah.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.954
Bye, sweetie. [hangs up]

52:35.152 --> 52:38.322
Hey! I can see your foot
sticking out.

52:41.242 --> 52:43.452
Come on, what are we doing?
Playing hide-and-seek?

52:43.536 --> 52:45.204
[Luke] No, we're not.

52:51.878 --> 52:53.921
So, what are you doing
here, mate?

52:54.005 --> 52:56.799
Well...I couldn't find Melrose.

52:59.385 --> 53:00.970
All right, let's get it over
with.

53:01.053 --> 53:03.264
How much will you get
for a photo of me?

53:03.347 --> 53:05.224
Oh. Like, a hundred bucks.

53:06.559 --> 53:07.685
100 bucks?

53:07.768 --> 53:09.562
Yeah. I mean, that's if I'm
lucky.

53:09.645 --> 53:12.231
Oh. What about if I took my
shirt off

53:12.315 --> 53:13.691
and I'm all sweaty, you know,

53:13.774 --> 53:15.484
coming out of the gym
all pumped up and...

53:15.568 --> 53:19.280
Ugh. No. Uh...60, maybe?

53:19.363 --> 53:20.448
Sixty?!

53:20.531 --> 53:21.449
Mm-hm.

53:21.532 --> 53:22.950
[sighs]

53:24.535 --> 53:26.662
Okay. Um...

53:26.746 --> 53:29.332
What about a photo of me
with Kim Kardashian?

53:29.415 --> 53:32.209
Now we're talking!
That would be amazing.

53:32.293 --> 53:35.129
I could get, like, 30 grand.
Maybe even more.

53:35.212 --> 53:37.673
Well, I mean, that's just for
a photo of Kim, though.

53:37.757 --> 53:38.841
Are you in it too?

53:38.925 --> 53:39.884
Yeah.

53:39.967 --> 53:43.220
Then it's, like, $120. Or less.

53:43.304 --> 53:44.722
Oh!

53:44.805 --> 53:46.724
Oh, don't worry.
I can crop you out of it.

53:46.807 --> 53:48.893
I got an idea, Paul.

53:48.976 --> 53:52.104
What if I, like, got photos of
you and, like, a new girlfriend?

53:52.188 --> 53:53.814
No.

53:53.898 --> 53:56.651
No, it could be good. It doesn't
have to be a girlfriend.

53:56.734 --> 53:58.361
Maybe, like...a lover.

53:59.612 --> 54:00.613
Forget about it.

54:00.696 --> 54:01.906
We could set that up.

54:01.989 --> 54:04.825
You know, I just met
a waitress at Denny's

54:04.909 --> 54:07.161
and she was really into
Australians.

54:07.244 --> 54:09.830
I was like, "Oh, I know
an Australian!"

54:09.914 --> 54:11.624
All right, listen.

54:11.707 --> 54:13.167
You don't have a car, do you?

54:13.250 --> 54:15.127
Yeah, I... No, I don't.

54:15.211 --> 54:16.629
Mmm. Okay.

54:16.712 --> 54:17.755
Why?

54:17.838 --> 54:19.840
Uh... No, I'd better not.

54:19.924 --> 54:21.217
No, I promised my manager

54:21.300 --> 54:22.969
I wouldn't get into
any more trouble.

54:23.052 --> 54:25.805
Oh, oh, oh! Do the opposite!

54:25.888 --> 54:28.933
Do whatever you said you
wouldn't do to your manager!

54:29.016 --> 54:30.643
Do the opposite of that.

54:30.726 --> 54:33.270
Let's do it! We'll do it
together! Paul, please!

54:33.354 --> 54:35.439
Please! Please!

54:35.523 --> 54:36.440
Oh...

54:37.775 --> 54:39.860
So, where are we going?

54:39.944 --> 54:41.821
We need to find stars.

54:41.904 --> 54:44.073
Yeah, you know, like George
Clooney, Julia Roberts...

54:44.156 --> 54:45.658
Kim Kardashian.

54:45.741 --> 54:50.371
I, uh...I used to know
where Cary Grant lived.

54:50.454 --> 54:52.373
Yeah, but, uh,
I think it's better

54:52.456 --> 54:55.209
if we stick to celebrities
that are still alive.

54:55.292 --> 54:57.086
Okay. Betty White?

54:57.169 --> 55:00.339
Oh...I mean, she's good.
It's just...

55:00.423 --> 55:01.424
What night is it?

55:01.507 --> 55:02.758
Uh, Wednesday, I think.

55:02.842 --> 55:04.552
Oh. Well, I know where they are.

55:04.635 --> 55:05.803
Yeah?

55:05.886 --> 55:07.722
[accelerates]

55:07.805 --> 55:08.931
[siren chirps]

55:09.015 --> 55:10.349
Oh.

55:10.433 --> 55:12.309
[siren chirps]

55:12.393 --> 55:13.769
Crap!

55:13.853 --> 55:17.148
Oh. Well, don't panic.
It's just the police.

55:17.231 --> 55:19.525
Yeah, but they've got big guns.

55:19.608 --> 55:23.070
Yeah, but if you don't do
anything stupid, they're fine.

55:33.622 --> 55:35.207
[Luke] What are you doing?

55:35.291 --> 55:38.711
Just, uh...I'm just waiting
for them to...

55:39.628 --> 55:40.921
...get, uh...

55:41.839 --> 55:43.049
...out of the car.

55:50.222 --> 55:51.140
Right!

55:51.223 --> 55:52.141
[tires squeal]

55:52.224 --> 55:54.143
[engine roars]

55:59.482 --> 56:02.068
[siren wailing]

56:04.987 --> 56:06.822
[horn honks]

56:13.913 --> 56:17.500
Oh, I forgot. Do you guys want
mints or water or anything?

56:17.583 --> 56:19.418
Uh...no, fine for now, John.

56:19.502 --> 56:21.378
What?! No!

56:21.462 --> 56:22.963
[tires squeal]

56:29.887 --> 56:32.223
Listen, you gotta...you gotta
pull over, talk to them!

56:32.306 --> 56:35.601
Uh, no, no. I can't. I don't
have my driver's license.

56:35.684 --> 56:37.645
Well, then just tell them
you left it at home!

56:37.728 --> 56:41.023
No, I don't have
a driving license.

56:41.107 --> 56:44.026
Come to think of it, I don't
even know whose car this is.

56:44.110 --> 56:46.654
What?! Come on!

56:53.285 --> 56:54.328
John!

56:54.411 --> 56:55.538
Get your camera out.

56:55.621 --> 56:57.289
Why, so I can photograph
my own death?!

56:57.373 --> 56:59.500
No, 'cause
just round this corner,

56:59.583 --> 57:02.211
there's gonna be
a mother lode of celebrities.

57:02.294 --> 57:06.006
Oh! Let's tap it. Let's tap!

57:19.145 --> 57:21.438
Stephanie. Tell us
about your latest role.

57:21.522 --> 57:24.150
She's a hard-nosed FBI agent

57:24.233 --> 57:26.485
that needs
a lot of people killed.

57:26.569 --> 57:28.487
Oh. How fun.

57:28.571 --> 57:29.989
Yes. [chuckles]

57:30.072 --> 57:30.990
Yeah.

57:31.073 --> 57:32.741
[tires squeal]

57:38.873 --> 57:40.583
No, no, no, no, no, no...!

57:42.501 --> 57:44.003
Arggh! No!

57:47.381 --> 57:51.343
Uh, there seems to be some kind
of disturbance happening.

57:51.427 --> 57:53.345
Oh, this chase is getting
out of control.

57:53.429 --> 57:56.599
Police are advising drivers
to avoid San Vicente Boulevard.

57:56.682 --> 58:00.644
I never get tired
of searchlights.

58:00.728 --> 58:04.190
Right, Luke, stay alert.
Kim Kardashian, two o'clock.

58:04.273 --> 58:05.691
Can you slow down a bit?

58:07.151 --> 58:08.819
I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

58:09.945 --> 58:10.988
Oh, look. Brad Pitt.

58:11.071 --> 58:12.114
Hey!

58:13.407 --> 58:14.325
Did you get him?

58:14.408 --> 58:15.326
No.

58:15.409 --> 58:16.327
I nearly did.

58:16.410 --> 58:17.453
Yeah, we noticed.

58:17.536 --> 58:18.746
[horn honks]

58:24.877 --> 58:25.961
[Man screams]

58:26.045 --> 58:26.962
Uh-oh.

58:27.046 --> 58:27.963
What was that?

58:28.047 --> 58:29.715
I think it was Harvey Weinstein.

58:29.798 --> 58:31.550
Mmm. Good.

58:31.634 --> 58:33.135
[tires screech]

58:33.219 --> 58:34.345
[Luke] Shit!

58:35.971 --> 58:37.932
[engine revs]

58:46.774 --> 58:48.525
[Reporter] And whilst I can't
make out who's driving,

58:48.609 --> 58:51.987
that is certainly Paul Hogan
in the passenger seat.

58:52.071 --> 58:53.948
Well, drivers are now
in a panic.

58:54.031 --> 58:56.325
The chase has moved
to the other side of the road.

58:56.408 --> 58:57.826
[cackles]

59:18.681 --> 59:21.642
[tires squeal]

59:31.110 --> 59:33.195
[engine idles]

59:33.279 --> 59:35.489
Thanks, guys!
Don't forget to rate me.

59:35.572 --> 59:36.782
Five stars.

59:38.784 --> 59:40.119
[John cackles]

59:40.202 --> 59:41.537
Hey, where's he going?!

59:41.620 --> 59:43.205
[Hogan] Quick. Inside.

59:43.289 --> 59:44.999
Hey, do you really think
that was Kim Kardashian?!

59:45.082 --> 59:46.333
Just get inside the...!

59:46.417 --> 59:47.835
Oh! Your place is gorgeous!

59:47.918 --> 59:48.836
Come here!

59:48.919 --> 59:49.837
You've got three garages?!

59:49.920 --> 59:51.213
You've got three cars?

59:51.297 --> 59:52.339
Or is it just storage?

59:52.423 --> 59:53.465
Oh, a tennis court!

59:53.549 --> 59:54.591
[helicopter whirs]

59:54.675 --> 59:56.093
That's awesome!

59:56.176 --> 59:57.428
I played tennis in high school.

59:57.511 --> 59:59.013
I'm actually pretty good
for my size.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:01.140
Oh, look at the size
of these doors!

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:02.224
Get in, get in!

01:00:02.308 --> 01:00:03.434
