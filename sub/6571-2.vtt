00:01.020 --> 00:04.421
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:04.523 --> 00:06.548
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:06.658 --> 00:08.626
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:14.233 --> 00:15.791
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:19.538 --> 00:22.871
<i>Michael Bluth was at home
working on a plan to save the company.</i>

00:22.975 --> 00:26.877
How's this for a business model?
We make the company look like it's in the black...

00:26.979 --> 00:29.106
by starting construction
on the phase two development.

00:29.214 --> 00:31.114
I know what you're thinking,
we're not in the black.

00:31.216 --> 00:33.707
How're we gonna build 30 houses without
any money? We don't. We build one-

00:33.819 --> 00:37.721
then we have a huge ribbon-cutting ceremony
while raising funds for the others.

00:37.823 --> 00:41.122
<i>Michael's father always
unveiled his construction projects...</i>

00:41.226 --> 00:44.423
<i>with a highly publicized
ribbon-cutting ceremony.</i>

00:44.530 --> 00:46.760
<i>He even did so
for the prison he built...</i>

00:46.865 --> 00:49.561
<i>and, somewhat ironically,
would later occupy.</i>

00:49.668 --> 00:53.434
The only difference is this time
I get to cut the ribbon. What do you think?

00:53.539 --> 00:55.632
There's a cream
with real diamonds in it.

00:55.741 --> 00:59.575
I can actually smear diamonds on my face,
and it's only $400 a tub.

00:59.678 --> 01:03.170
That's like, what, like
a million diamonds for $400?

01:03.282 --> 01:05.580
- Mm.
- A million- diamonds.

01:05.684 --> 01:09.245
<i>- Okay.
- Is she on you about that diamond cream?</i>

01:09.354 --> 01:11.982
<i>My husband's jealous because since
we decided to have an open marriage...</i>

01:12.091 --> 01:14.082
I've been doing
a little better than he has.

01:14.193 --> 01:16.320
It is not a competition, Lindsay.

01:16.428 --> 01:18.760
We are doing this
to save our marriage.

01:18.864 --> 01:22.630
<i>But I should be telling you that I have
been meeting my fair share of groupies.</i>

01:22.734 --> 01:25.294
Or should I say "Bluepies"?

01:25.404 --> 01:27.599
<i>Tobias had recently
auditioned as an understudy...</i>

01:27.706 --> 01:30.470
<i>for the silent performance
art trio, the Blue Man Group.</i>

01:30.576 --> 01:35.206
<i>And this is "Kids" from Bye, Bye, Birdie.</i>

01:36.515 --> 01:38.949
<i>He had yet to hear back from them.</i>

01:39.051 --> 01:42.543
You guys really think you have the guts to go
through with this "seeing other people" thing?

01:42.654 --> 01:46.556
<i>In fact, neither Lindsay nor
Tobias did have the guts to go through with it.</i>

01:46.658 --> 01:48.558
- I already have.
- I have too.

01:48.660 --> 01:50.787
Can I buy you a drink?

01:50.896 --> 01:53.990
<i>No.
- Lindsay, because
she'd lost her self-confidence.</i>

01:54.099 --> 01:57.068
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Where's she going?

01:57.169 --> 02:00.696
<i>And Tobias, because
he was busy keeping an eye on Lindsay.</i>

02:00.806 --> 02:03.240
Who are you gonna bring
to this ribbon-cutting dance?

02:03.342 --> 02:07.472
It's not a dance, and you don't need a date.
Although, George Michael...

02:07.579 --> 02:10.377
I'd love for you to come with me
when I cut the ribbon at the new house.

02:10.482 --> 02:12.416
Oh, wow.
Hey, can I bring Ann?

02:12.518 --> 02:14.213
Who?

02:14.319 --> 02:17.686
Ann. You know, she's- she's the girl
I'm kinda hanging out with.

02:17.789 --> 02:19.313
- I haven't met Ann.
- Yes, you have.

02:19.424 --> 02:22.723
<i>- Michael had met Ann.
- You let her in.</i>

02:23.929 --> 02:26.830
See, that's her right over there.

02:26.932 --> 02:28.832
<i>- Oh, Ann. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.</i>

02:28.934 --> 02:33.166
I know Ann. Hey, you!
She's got a little hard-boiled egg going there.

02:33.272 --> 02:35.934
Oh, it's so cute. She sometimes takes
a little pack of mayonnaise...

02:36.041 --> 02:38.407
and she'll squirt it in her mouth,
and then she'll take an egg...

02:38.510 --> 02:40.671
and kind of- mmm.

02:40.779 --> 02:43.577
She calls it a mayonn-egg.

02:43.682 --> 02:45.775
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel so good.

02:45.884 --> 02:48.512
You know, I kind of wanna
buy her a diamond.

02:48.620 --> 02:51.350
- Her?
- Ann.

02:51.456 --> 02:54.391
I know I can't afford it, but Aunt Lindsay
was telling me about this diamond cream.

02:54.493 --> 02:59.123
George Michael, um, I'm sure that Egg is
a very nice person. I just don't want you spending-

02:59.231 --> 03:02.564
- It's Ann. Her na-
- all your money getting her
all glittered up for Easter.

03:02.668 --> 03:04.693
You know? More importantly,
I want us to do this together.

03:04.803 --> 03:07.203
Kinda like a father-son
sort of thing, you know?

03:07.306 --> 03:10.707
And since Pop-Pop is no longer president,
we get to do it.

03:10.809 --> 03:14.370
- I thought Gob was president.
- Yeah, and I don't have any problem with that.

03:14.479 --> 03:17.346
<i>In fact,
since Michael's father escaped from prison...</i>

03:17.449 --> 03:21.442
<i>his brother Gob had been made president,
albeit in name only.</i>

03:21.553 --> 03:25.011
<i>Which is why Michael was surprised
when he got to work the next day.</i>

03:25.123 --> 03:28.115
- You're still in my office.
- Gosh, Michael, I am kind of the president.

03:28.227 --> 03:30.787
And I have no problem with that.
But it is just a title, remember?

03:30.896 --> 03:34.491
Just doing this to appease the stockholders,
while they scrutinize me for Dad's crimes.

03:34.600 --> 03:38.730
Hey, Dad may have illegally built some homes
in Iraq, which is kinda not cool.

03:38.837 --> 03:40.828
I know, but that's why
I've got a business model...

03:40.939 --> 03:43.567
that I think is going
to restore the image of our company.

03:43.675 --> 03:45.575
We're going to build
a second model home.

03:45.677 --> 03:47.736
That's great.
Can I announce it to the board?

03:47.846 --> 03:49.780
Gee, it is my business model.

03:49.881 --> 03:52.748
If you had a business model, then by all means,
go in there and do your little dance.

03:52.851 --> 03:54.842
Tell you what we're gonna do.
Rock, paper, scissors for it.

03:54.953 --> 03:57.444
- No, no, I'm not interested in doing-
- One, two, three.

03:57.556 --> 04:00.787
- Paper covers rock.
- It is a rock though. It should beat everything.

04:00.892 --> 04:05.124
There's not a lot of logic to it. It's like
on a boat with "Women and children first."

04:05.230 --> 04:08.927
Why should they-which, before I forget,
I'm buying a company boat.

04:09.034 --> 04:10.934
Sorry?

04:11.036 --> 04:14.437
<i>That morning, Gob had gone to a
boat show, where he saw something he wanted.</i>

04:14.539 --> 04:16.939
- Hello.
- Hi.

04:17.041 --> 04:18.976
- What a beauty.
- Thank you.

04:19.077 --> 04:21.442
- I meant you.
- Well.

04:21.546 --> 04:24.947
<i>Gob flirted with her
for a while, and finally asked for her number.</i>

04:25.050 --> 04:29.111
- Let's get some digits.
- I'm sorry. I don't give it out without a firm offer.

04:29.221 --> 04:32.054
Oh, I'll make you a firm offer.

04:32.157 --> 04:34.182
<i>Unfortunately, she wasn't flirting.</i>

04:34.293 --> 04:37.729
And here again, please.

04:37.829 --> 04:40.662
- The Seaward.
- You're not getting a boat.

04:40.766 --> 04:43.667
- One, two, three.
- No, not gonna do it.

04:43.769 --> 04:46.294
- Paper covers rock.
- Fine. But rock sinks boat.

04:46.405 --> 04:48.930
- Michael?
- Mom, I'm right in the middle of something.

04:49.041 --> 04:52.374
- Get rid of the Seaward.
- I'll leave when I'm good and ready.

04:54.179 --> 04:57.808
<i>It's about your Uncle Oscar.
I want him to move in with you.</i>

04:57.916 --> 04:59.975
You're not kicking him out
already, are you?

05:00.085 --> 05:03.350
<i>Michael's uncle
had recently moved into Lucille's apartment...</i>

05:03.455 --> 05:06.913
<i>where they quickly rekindled
a long-dormant romance.</i>

05:07.025 --> 05:10.153
<i>- It was a secret she hoped to keep-
- Oscar, we'll be heard.</i>

05:10.262 --> 05:12.730
<i>- and he didn't.
- That's what makes it so hot.</i>

05:12.831 --> 05:15.061
<i>Mother?</i>

05:15.167 --> 05:16.691
<i>Mother!</i>

05:18.270 --> 05:21.171
- I heard zoo noises.
- It's nothing. Go back to bed.

05:21.273 --> 05:24.265
<i>So, everybody's still up, huh?</i>

05:29.114 --> 05:31.674
It's not fair to Buster.
He's a nervous wreck right now.

05:31.783 --> 05:34.377
He's going into the army,
for God's sake.

05:34.486 --> 05:36.852
You volunteered him.

05:36.955 --> 05:40.186
I knew you were going to
throw that in my face.

05:40.292 --> 05:42.522
Don't worry about it, okay?
They're never gonna take him anyway.

05:42.627 --> 05:45.994
<i>At that moment, Buster was taking
his physical at the recruitment center.</i>

05:46.098 --> 05:49.397
I don't have a hole in my heart.
I've never opened my eyes underwater.

05:49.501 --> 05:51.526
My-
Reproductive organ...

05:51.636 --> 05:53.866
is shaped like-
a lobster tail...

05:53.972 --> 05:56.372
but without its shell, hmm?

05:56.475 --> 05:58.670
Oh, I guess I have the panic attacks
under control.

05:58.777 --> 06:01.302
Oh, and I'm legally blind at night.

06:01.413 --> 06:05.042
<i>But Buster had miscalculated
the army's current need for personnel.</i>

06:05.150 --> 06:07.050
Okay, then, let's get you fitted
for a uniform.

06:07.152 --> 06:09.712
What? What?

06:09.821 --> 06:12.415
Hey, why don't you volunteer Oscar?
That would solve both of your problems.

06:12.524 --> 06:14.651
He'd never cut his hair.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.751
That hair.

06:16.862 --> 06:19.990
Listen, Oscar's your problem. I'm taking care
of everything else in this family...

06:20.098 --> 06:23.625
including starting construction
on a second model home.

06:23.735 --> 06:26.067
We're having
a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

06:26.171 --> 06:29.572
We can't have a ribbon-cutting
without your father, and he's God knows where.

06:29.674 --> 06:31.938
<i>George Sr. Was in Mexico...</i>

06:32.043 --> 06:34.068
<i>with his escape accomplice
and ex-secretary, Kitty.</i>

06:34.179 --> 06:38.980
I keep eating so many eggs. It must be
my unconscious desire to have a baby.

06:39.084 --> 06:43.077
Oh, my God. Can you even imagine how cute
the combination of the two of us would be?

06:44.523 --> 06:48.050
I mean, we're all out of
"prophylacticos" anyway.

06:48.160 --> 06:52.096
Somebody used the last two on his feet
to walk across the bathroom floor.

06:52.197 --> 06:55.064
<i>But he was growing tired
of their confined intimacy.</i>

06:55.167 --> 06:57.931
- I've made a huge mistake.
- Hey, it's me.

06:58.036 --> 07:00.664
- Dad?
- Yeah. Listen, I gotta make this quick.

07:00.772 --> 07:04.299
You're the only one who can save the family,
but you gotta keep the company strong...

07:04.409 --> 07:06.434
because I'm gonna need
some of that money later.

07:06.545 --> 07:08.809
I will, Dad. It's funny,
after all these years of...

07:08.914 --> 07:11.940
- you making fun of me for the magic shows and-
- Gob!

07:12.050 --> 07:15.383
Oh, for God's- I called to talk to Michael,
you horse's-

07:17.856 --> 07:20.188
<i>- Gob was hurt.
- Bye, Pop.</i>

07:20.292 --> 07:23.056
Hey, whoa, whoa, was that Dad?

07:23.161 --> 07:25.561
Yeah, I had to, uh, jump off.

07:25.664 --> 07:27.791
You just had Dad on the phone?
Where was he?

07:27.899 --> 07:29.799
No way to tell, really.
Portugal.

07:29.901 --> 07:32.392
<i>- Down South America way.
- Well, did he wanna talk to me?</i>

07:32.504 --> 07:35.803
No, he wanted to talk
to the president.

07:35.907 --> 07:39.468
<i>- I have no problem with that.
- Michael was also hurt.</i>

07:39.578 --> 07:41.705
<i>And George Sr.
Was brutally hurt...</i>

07:41.813 --> 07:44.304
<i>when he was mistaken
for his twin brother Oscar.</i>

07:44.416 --> 07:46.543
<i>Marijuana? No, no.</i>

07:46.651 --> 07:49.677
That's my brother.
"Brothero. Brothero."

07:52.357 --> 07:54.257
<i>That night, Lindsay headed to the club...</i>

07:54.359 --> 07:56.293
<i>to try again to meet someone.</i>

08:02.934 --> 08:06.700
<i>Soon, having struck out again,
she spotted a man who looked interesting.</i>

08:06.805 --> 08:09.205
<i>He had the lean look,
effortless hair...</i>

08:09.307 --> 08:11.366
<i>and dressed-down manner
of a movie star.</i>

08:11.476 --> 08:14.707
- Buy me a drink?
- I think the bar's closing.

08:14.813 --> 08:16.940
I know a place.

08:19.684 --> 08:22.847
<i>It was at that point
that Lindsay had a startling revelation.</i>

08:22.954 --> 08:25.821
Uh, uh, uh, you get out.
Get out. Get out. Out, out, out!

08:25.924 --> 08:29.360
- No homeless in here!
- Homeless? You're homeless?

08:29.461 --> 08:32.953
You're gross. Oh, God.

08:38.803 --> 08:41.703
They're taking me in the army. They didn't
think there was enough wrong with me.

08:41.806 --> 08:44.468
Well, did they check everything?

08:44.576 --> 08:48.535
Yes. They even touched my Charlie Browns.
You lied to me.

08:48.647 --> 08:50.706
- You said I wasn't fit to serve.
- Okay, hold on.

08:50.815 --> 08:52.715
Let's calm down, people.

08:52.817 --> 08:55.945
Um, I think I know a little bit
about avoiding combat duty.

08:56.054 --> 08:58.386
Now which pinkie do you use less?

08:58.490 --> 09:01.789
Are you nuts? Do you know
what I went through to have this boy?

09:01.893 --> 09:05.420
Oh, I know where the boy came from.

09:07.566 --> 09:10.057
Wait.
Why were you in the pantry?

09:11.436 --> 09:13.563
<i>And Lucille realized
it was time to end...</i>

09:13.672 --> 09:15.572
<i>whatever it was
she had with Oscar.</i>

09:15.674 --> 09:17.574
So, I believe it's a good plan.

09:17.676 --> 09:21.168
<i>The next day, Michael was ready to wow
the board with his new business model.</i>

09:21.279 --> 09:23.509
As I told my brother,
the president...

09:23.615 --> 09:25.640
if we start construction
on a second model home...

09:25.750 --> 09:28.150
we can be cutting this ribbon
within two months.

09:29.454 --> 09:33.584
I said, "That's why you're
no longer president."

09:33.692 --> 09:38.288
Two weeks.
Let's do it in two weeks. Hey!

09:41.866 --> 09:44.596
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Can we stop the music?

09:44.703 --> 09:47.137
<i>I'm not as optimistic that we can get that done.</i>

09:47.238 --> 09:50.401
Gob, I think we both agree
that we would do things your way...

09:50.508 --> 09:52.772
if you had a business model.

09:52.877 --> 09:55.471
Do you have
a business model, Gob?

09:55.580 --> 09:57.980
I am so happy
that you asked me that, Michael...

09:58.083 --> 10:01.951
because I just happen
to have a business model right here.

10:02.053 --> 10:04.886
<i>Solid as a rock</i>

10:04.990 --> 10:08.391
Meet Starla, the new Bluth Company
business model...

10:08.493 --> 10:10.552
<i>for our phase two campaign.</i>

10:10.662 --> 10:13.961
Solid as a rock.

10:14.065 --> 10:17.228
We'll see you at the ribbon-cutting
in two weeks...

10:17.335 --> 10:19.895
if my brother doesn't
screw it up first.

10:21.106 --> 10:24.041
- Hey!

10:25.844 --> 10:30.144
<i>Gob had committed Michael
to building a model home in two weeks.</i>

10:30.248 --> 10:34.412
We can't build a house in two weeks.
Also, I'm not sure how "Solid as a Rock"...

10:34.519 --> 10:37.545
helps people forget the fact
that we built houses in Iraq.

10:37.656 --> 10:39.988
- I love that.
- But you probably know best
because you're president.

10:40.091 --> 10:41.991
We don't have to build
a real house, Michael.

10:42.093 --> 10:45.585
Like you said, it's all for appearances anyway.
We throw up a couple of walls.

10:45.697 --> 10:47.665
- We build a fake one.
- What are you talking about?

10:47.766 --> 10:50.326
Nothing on the inside.

10:50.435 --> 10:53.029
I'll never get a crew to build it.
They'd lose their licenses.

10:53.138 --> 10:55.436
Then you build it
yourself, damn it!

10:55.540 --> 10:59.237
Hey, there she is,
my little business model.

11:02.147 --> 11:04.741
Sorry about that
"build it yourself' crap.

11:04.849 --> 11:06.578
I might take her
to the ribbon-cutting.

11:06.685 --> 11:08.949
- You end up finding a date yet?
- No.

11:09.054 --> 11:12.182
<i>As Michael grew frustrated
by his relationship with Gob...</i>

11:12.290 --> 11:14.952
<i>Lucille tried to end hers
with Oscar.</i>

11:15.060 --> 11:17.551
- I want you out of the house.
- Oh, I want you everywhere.

11:17.662 --> 11:21.928
Oscar, no. I can't have this in my life
anymore. I'm a married woman.

11:22.033 --> 11:24.194
Lucille, you wanna leave?
I won't chase after you.

11:24.302 --> 11:26.964
But before you do, ask yourself,
"Where's your husband?"

11:27.072 --> 11:31.099
Because I am here. I am real.
I am flesh and blood.

11:31.209 --> 11:33.109
<i>And hair.</i>

11:33.211 --> 11:36.078
Oh, God, that hair.

11:36.181 --> 11:38.672
What will people say?

11:38.783 --> 11:42.014
They'll say,
"Those people are in love."

11:44.355 --> 11:47.415
<i>That night, the evening news
report said something very different.</i>

11:47.525 --> 11:51.894
Lucille Bluth, caught on tape
breathing life into a homeless man.

11:51.996 --> 11:54.897
The surprising home video
at 10:00.

11:54.999 --> 11:56.967
<i>And Michael prepared to build a house.</i>

11:57.068 --> 11:59.559
Two weeks?
But what if my date's not available?

11:59.671 --> 12:02.663
I'm trying to get a last-minute crew together.
Your inability to get a man interested...

12:02.774 --> 12:05.675
- is not at the top of my list.
- Oh, I've got a man interested, Michael.

12:05.777 --> 12:07.938
- What's wrong with him?
- There's nothing wrong with him.

12:09.114 --> 12:11.776
He is homeless.

12:11.883 --> 12:14.078
Well, I didn't know
he was homeless at the time.

12:14.185 --> 12:16.915
- It was humiliating.
- Is this about Gangy's homeless guy?

12:17.021 --> 12:19.683
- Gangy's homeless guy?
- Yeah, it's all over the news.

12:19.791 --> 12:23.420
Gangy gave C.P.R.
To a homeless guy on the beach.

12:23.528 --> 12:25.462
<i>Lindsay felt respect for her mother...</i>

12:25.563 --> 12:29.431
<i>and decided that perhaps she could overcome
her pride and help someone too.</i>

12:29.534 --> 12:34.369
I've got someone for your crew, Michael.
My boyfriend, the homeless guy.

12:34.472 --> 12:37.805
I wonder if he even has an apartment or-

12:37.909 --> 12:40.639
- Hello.
- Did you see the news?

12:40.745 --> 12:43.475
Your Uncle Oscar forced himself on me
at the beach today...

12:43.581 --> 12:45.947
- and I didn't have my horn.
- Of course.

12:46.050 --> 12:48.780
It was Uncle Oscar. Mom,
you're not having an affair with him, are you?

12:48.887 --> 12:51.447
You're building a house?
I want you to give it to him.

12:51.556 --> 12:54.787
- It's not a real house.
- Perfect. He's not a real man.

12:54.893 --> 12:57.657
<i>And George Sr.
Made his case to the Mexican police.</i>

12:57.762 --> 13:00.890
<i>My God, I was beaten up here. I'm telling you.
I'm George. I'm not Oscar. I'm George.</i>

13:00.999 --> 13:05.231
<i>- The Cornballer.
- Ssí. The Cornballer.</i>

13:05.336 --> 13:10.137
<i>George Sr. Had marketed
a device called the Cornballer in Mexico...</i>

13:10.241 --> 13:13.506
<i>after the severe burns
it caused led to it being banned in the U.S.</i>

13:13.611 --> 13:17.308
<i>- Why, did you have one?
- Ssí.</i>

13:21.619 --> 13:24.179
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile,
was having trouble finding her homeless man.</i>

13:24.289 --> 13:28.749
<i>- He looked like a movie star.
- The man looked like a movie star
because he was a movie star.</i>

13:28.860 --> 13:32.591
<i>His name was Tom Jane, and he was making
two movies for a major studio.</i>

13:32.697 --> 13:35.791
<i>One was a gritty personal project
about a junkie's life...</i>

13:35.900 --> 13:38.562
<i>which he got to do
in exchange for making...</i>

13:38.670 --> 13:41.230
<i>a rigidly, formulaic popcorn movie.</i>

13:41.339 --> 13:43.830
<i>- He was living on the streets, researching his role.
- Hey, homeless guy.</i>

13:43.942 --> 13:46.536
- Hey.
- I'm not proud of the way...

13:46.644 --> 13:49.078
I was so grossed out when I found out
you were gross before.

13:49.180 --> 13:51.080
You really thought
I was gross, huh?

13:51.182 --> 13:55.278
Well, at first, I thought you were kind of hot,
but I hadn't looked closely enough.

13:55.386 --> 13:58.253
Listen, I have
a construction job for you.

13:58.356 --> 14:02.725
And if you clean yourself up, who knows?
You might actually get a date out of this.

14:04.362 --> 14:08.025
- Okay.
- See ya.

14:12.704 --> 14:16.800
Okay, we've all made some sacrifices to be here,
but we all want the same thing.

14:16.908 --> 14:19.934
- I wanna live here.
- I wanna buy Ann some diamond dust.

14:20.044 --> 14:23.411
<i>I'm just hoping to get mildly injured,
so I can get out of the army.</i>

14:23.514 --> 14:25.880
Bottom line is we've got two weeks
to build a house.

14:25.984 --> 14:28.145
It doesn't have to be good.
It just has to look good.

14:28.253 --> 14:30.448
I just want my kids back.

14:32.423 --> 14:34.482
<i>And so, the guys went to work.</i>

14:39.364 --> 14:42.822
<i>Things didn't go smoothly at first.</i>

14:44.102 --> 14:46.764
<i>Buster looked for ways
to hurt himself.</i>

14:51.542 --> 14:56.104
<i>But soon the project came together-
when Gob stopped by.</i>

14:57.682 --> 14:59.582
<i>Now we're building a house.</i>

14:59.684 --> 15:03.085
- Yeah, I'm pretty proud-
- So, what do you think? Did I do this or what?

15:03.187 --> 15:05.087
Seems like your brother did it.

15:05.189 --> 15:07.453
My brother does what I tell him to do.
I'm the president.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.958
Where's your "P"?

15:10.061 --> 15:12.689
What?
Oh, no, not again.

15:12.797 --> 15:14.765
I got it.

15:14.866 --> 15:18.358
Hey, sorry for the "my brother does
what I tell him to do" crap...

15:18.469 --> 15:20.699
but I want this to be perfect
for when I cut the ribbon tomorrow.

15:20.805 --> 15:22.705
You're cutting the ribbon?

15:22.807 --> 15:25.139
I kinda thought
that since I built it...

15:25.243 --> 15:27.438
- I might go ahead and give it a-
- Yeah, okay.

15:27.545 --> 15:30.013
Can you imagine how
that would look to the board?

15:30.114 --> 15:34.448
The construction worker cutting the ribbon.
No, no, that's a job for the president.

15:34.552 --> 15:37.146
<i>Michael had a problem with that.</i>

15:37.255 --> 15:39.587
<i>- Gob had taken away something
Michael always wanted.
- You got the "P."</i>

15:39.691 --> 15:43.491
<i>Now it was Michael's turn
to take something from Gob- Starla.</i>

15:43.594 --> 15:47.963
<i>And later, Michael
set about his plan.</i>

15:48.066 --> 15:49.966
Gob, do you have
Starla's phone number?

15:50.068 --> 15:52.628
<i>I got a few business things
I'd like to go over with the business model.</i>

15:52.737 --> 15:56.833
<i>Guess who was just over her?
Don't, I'll tell you- me.</i>

15:56.941 --> 15:59.637
- Hmm?
- L- the business model.

15:59.744 --> 16:01.371
<i>Actually, theyjust made out.</i>

16:01.479 --> 16:04.312
Yeah, she had
all kinds of orgasms.

16:04.415 --> 16:07.316
Imagine that. I finally nailed
somebody that you weren't after.

16:07.418 --> 16:11.184
That's it. I've worked too hard and too long
for you to keep getting all the credit.

16:11.289 --> 16:13.553
I built that company, that house,
and I'm gonna be cutting the ribbon...

16:13.658 --> 16:16.354
whether we're all pretending
that you're president or not.

16:16.461 --> 16:18.486
Yeah, sure.
I just wanted-

16:18.596 --> 16:22.828
- You just wanted what?
- I just wanted you to be impressed with me.

16:22.934 --> 16:26.870
Dad never was.
Never said a nice thing about me.

16:26.971 --> 16:29.667
He called you the other day.
He didn't even wanna talk to me.

16:29.774 --> 16:33.904
Of course he did!
He never wants to talk to me. He never has.

16:39.183 --> 16:41.083
- Cut the ribbon.
- Really?

16:41.185 --> 16:42.880
- Yeah. How about that?
- Michael.

16:42.987 --> 16:44.955
I have no problem with it.

16:45.056 --> 16:48.958
- All right? Take it easy. Come on.
- Thank you.

16:50.862 --> 16:54.696
<i>The next day, the Bluth family
prepared to unveil phase two.</i>

16:54.799 --> 16:57.097
Have you seen your Uncle Gob around?

16:57.201 --> 17:00.102
No. And I can't find that diamond dust
that Aunt Lindsay bought for me.

17:00.204 --> 17:03.469
Oh, well, your Aunt Lindsay has probably taken it.
She's just a taker.

17:03.574 --> 17:06.372
This is your chance, huh?
With the big ribbon-cutters after all these years?

17:06.477 --> 17:08.604
Well, actually, I figured,
give Gob a chance, you know?

17:08.713 --> 17:11.204
The guy doesn't get
a whole lot of attention in this family.

17:11.315 --> 17:16.810
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the president
of the Bluth Company, Gob Bluth.</i>

17:19.457 --> 17:21.982
My brother wasn't optimistic
it could be done.

17:22.093 --> 17:26.154
<i>But I didn't take "wasn't optimistic
it could be done"...</i>

17:26.263 --> 17:28.164
<i>for an answer.</i>

17:30.435 --> 17:34.235
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you
phase two of the Bluth Company.</i>

17:34.338 --> 17:38.240
A house truly solid as a rock.

17:42.580 --> 17:44.741
<i>But as it turns out...</i>

17:44.849 --> 17:49.013
<i>Michael was right to not be optimistic
it could be done.</i>

17:51.556 --> 17:55.322
<i>And Buster
saw the chance to get injured enough...</i>

17:55.426 --> 17:57.326
<i>to keep him out of the army.</i>

17:59.464 --> 18:03.594
<i>But instead...</i>

18:03.701 --> 18:06.101
<i>- got a glimpse inside.
- I can't look at that.</i>

18:06.204 --> 18:08.104
<i>Unfortunately, Tobias had to.</i>

18:08.206 --> 18:11.767
I got the wrong homeless man.
I am sorry. I was looking for Lindsay.

18:11.876 --> 18:15.937
<i>You lied to me.
You both lied to me. I'm goin'to war.</i>

18:16.047 --> 18:19.346
- Buster, you can't!
- Yes, I can.

18:19.450 --> 18:21.941
I don't agree
with your dirty doings here...

18:22.053 --> 18:24.681
but I will defend with my life
your right to do it.

18:26.424 --> 18:28.858
<i>You planned this all along,
didn't you, Michael?</i>

18:28.960 --> 18:31.793
- No, I didn't. I had no crew. I had no time.
- You set me up.

18:31.896 --> 18:34.660
<i>Gob charged
at Michael with the scissors...</i>

18:34.765 --> 18:37.632
<i>but Michael,
as he always did, picked rock-</i>

18:37.735 --> 18:40.033
<i>- You wanted to make me look foolish!
- Put down the scissors.</i>

18:40.138 --> 18:42.868
- Put 'em down.
- Foolish with scissors!

18:42.974 --> 18:45.204
<i>Which beat scissors.</i>

18:47.111 --> 18:50.205
<i>Unfortunately, the whole incident
was covered by the paper.</i>

18:50.314 --> 18:52.214
Nobody looks good in this.

18:52.316 --> 18:55.774
- Especially that little dude.
- That's Ann.

18:55.887 --> 18:57.878
- Who's-
- It doesn't matter. Listen.

18:57.989 --> 19:01.390
You know I didn't set you up, okay?
I think the only reason you and I always fight...

19:01.492 --> 19:04.154
is that since we were little kids,
Dad's always played us off each other.

19:04.262 --> 19:06.696
Dad always said
that was your fault.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.992
Anyway, what we oughta do
is make a decision right now...

19:09.100 --> 19:11.227
not to let Dad get in the middle
of our relationship anymore.

19:11.335 --> 19:13.735
- He's not even in town, and we're fighting.
- We're grown men.

19:13.838 --> 19:17.239
- Yeah, let's just move on.
- Look at me. I'm the president of a company now.

19:17.341 --> 19:20.367
Oh, that's Dad's line. I bet he saw the paper.

19:20.478 --> 19:23.413
Listen, if you want my respect,
you won't answer that, okay?

19:23.514 --> 19:25.414
It's just gonna
cause more problems.

19:27.785 --> 19:31.915
Hello? They hung up.

19:32.023 --> 19:34.287
They hung up on me.
Hiya, guys.

19:34.392 --> 19:36.587
I couldn't get the money.
I don't know what happened.

19:36.694 --> 19:38.594
- I'm impressed you hung up.
- Did I hang up?

19:38.696 --> 19:40.926
- I meant to hit speaker.
- Oh.

19:41.032 --> 19:43.364
- You gotta hit the line first.
- I'm hitting both at the same time.

19:43.467 --> 19:45.526
- These are the lines. There's a line here.
- But she said-

19:45.636 --> 19:47.536
- It's line and then-
- Hey.

19:47.638 --> 19:50.607
I don't wanna wait until Dad's dead
for us to get along.

19:50.708 --> 19:53.074
<i>But it was too late...</i>

19:53.177 --> 19:56.044
<i>as George Sr. Would be declared dead...</i>

19:56.147 --> 19:58.377
<i>within the hour.</i>

19:58.482 --> 20:01.315
- From now on, we support each other.
- We start with a clean slate.

20:01.419 --> 20:04.582
- Yeah.
- We almost did it though, didn't we?

20:04.689 --> 20:07.055
We almost pulled it off.

20:07.158 --> 20:09.786
- No, it wasn't even close.
- Yeah, a lot of people got hurt.

20:09.894 --> 20:12.385
- This was very, very bad.
- Not great. Not great.

20:12.496 --> 20:15.431
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

20:15.533 --> 20:18.934
<i>Lindsay finds out the true identity
ofher homeless man.</i>

20:19.036 --> 20:23.132
Look. You're a really nice chick,
but I'm not homeless.

20:23.241 --> 20:25.334
I'm Tom Jane.

20:25.443 --> 20:27.468
<i>And even though Lindsay
doesn't know who that is...</i>

20:27.578 --> 20:29.842
<i>hearing that he isn't homeless
is good enough for her.</i>

20:29.947 --> 20:34.281
- Buy me a drink?
- You're really sweet, but, no.

20:34.385 --> 20:36.285
I'm Tom Jane.

20:36.387 --> 20:38.821
<i>And Lindsay, crushed and alone...</i>

20:38.923 --> 20:41.892
<i>for the first time
misses her husband.</i>

20:41.993 --> 20:46.930
Tobias.

20:47.031 --> 20:50.660
Lindsay, I'm-

20:50.768 --> 20:52.497
Is that George Michael's
diamond cream?

20:52.603 --> 20:56.095
Oh, yes, well, I ran out of blue,
and I couldn't find anything else.

20:56.207 --> 20:59.665
I think my nipples are bleeding though. I don't
know if you're supposed to use quite this much.

21:01.779 --> 21:04.509
- That guy's a jerk.
- No, I am.

21:04.615 --> 21:08.107
No, no, I am.

21:08.219 --> 21:10.483
Because I think I need
to go to the hospital right away...

21:10.588 --> 21:14.991
and see if I can't get some of this diamond dust
vacuumed from out of my lungs.

21:15.092 --> 21:16.719
This way.
