WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.993
(distant chatter)

00:14.097 --> 00:16.088
What, you want to talk to the fence?

00:21.021 --> 00:23.228
Listen, people are starting to talk,

00:23.273 --> 00:25.559
so I just want to get
our story straight, all right?

00:25.609 --> 00:27.349
Be clear about what we're saying.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.441
I haven't said anything.
I don't know what we're doing.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.196
I'm not entirely sure what happened.

00:33.242 --> 00:35.278
Sorry. You're not sure
what happened?

00:35.327 --> 00:36.737
Well, I can tell you that.

00:36.787 --> 00:39.324
We were engaged,
and then you slept with another woman.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.659
You lied about it,
you tried to hide it from me,

00:41.708 --> 00:42.993
and then I found out.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.203
It's not that simple, Andy.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.369
It is simple.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.504
The problem with the story
is that I don't like it.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.166
You made me look like such an idiot.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.504
I work with you.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.135
I mean, I work with her.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.223
I'm not willing to be that girl, so...

01:01.228 --> 01:02.513
here's what I propose.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.809
Things were moving a little too fast.
We're taking some space.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.690
Eventually everything's
gonna fade away.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.396
No one's gonna care anyway.

01:11.905 --> 01:12.940
That is what I want.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.489
That is the least you can do for me.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.991
(basketball bouncing)

01:21.039 --> 01:21.869
I'm sorry.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.576
Yeah, so am I.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.212
(indistinct conversations)

01:39.600 --> 01:41.716
— I'll see you later.
— See ya.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.304
— Hey.
— Hey.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.934
Hey, I couldn't get ahold of you
all weekend.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.060
What the hell is going on?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.017
Yeah, I was staying at my dad's.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.022
Did your dad fall off the wagon?

01:50.068 --> 01:52.104
No, no. He's on a sobriety cruise.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.394
12 steps and a shuffleboard.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.402
He's fine.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.939
So then why are you staying there?

01:58.368 --> 02:00.324
Luke and l are taking a break.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.235
What?

02:02.289 --> 02:04.405
No, it's——l'm fine.
It's fine. It's just——

02:04.458 --> 02:07.416
We're taking some space.
We were moving too——

02:07.461 --> 02:08.621
I don't believe in space.
It doesn't work.

02:08.670 --> 02:09.876
(Andy) Perfect. (sighs)

02:09.921 --> 02:12.412
No. Every couple gets one breakup.
That's it. One.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.627
More than that, I'm sorry, you're over.
You're done.

02:14.676 --> 02:18.464
So don't waste it.
Space is for losers.

02:18.513 --> 02:21.050
Yeah, maybe so.
Now get out of mine.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.430
Ooh.

02:25.479 --> 02:29.222
Okay, Linda's collecting perishables
and canned goods at the front desk.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.105
It's getting cold out there,

02:31.151 --> 02:33.267
and we have at least
5,000 homeless in our city,

02:33.320 --> 02:35.185
so it's the least we can do.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.978
In other news,

02:37.032 --> 02:39.648
Sam's old buddy George Goodman
has just been released

02:39.701 --> 02:41.908
from the mental health facility
downtown... (chuckles)

02:41.953 --> 02:44.569
So, uh, let's keep an eye out for him.

02:44.623 --> 02:47.535
And apparently
it's day three without caffeine

02:47.584 --> 02:49.620
for Officers Shaw and Swarek.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.662
Whoever caffeinates first pays
the tab at the Penny tonight.

02:52.714 --> 02:53.920
(Sam) Your stupid idea.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.296
(Oliver) You know what?
It was my wife's stupid idea, dude,

02:55.342 --> 02:56.422
and you didn't have to agree with it.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.174
All right, people. It's Friday night.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.212
Drunks, drunks, and...

03:01.264 --> 03:02.470
maybe some drunk people.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.722
(man coughs)

03:03.767 --> 03:05.974
All right. Let's hit it.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.725
(Oliver) All right. Let's start local.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.557
We can get some
of these happy—hour soakers

03:09.606 --> 03:10.721
off the street, right?

03:10.774 --> 03:11.809
Get close.
Smell their breath.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.600
Pay attention to details——
stammering, lying,

03:14.653 --> 03:16.314
bottle of vodka kicking around
in the backseat.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.776
Epstein, you've been drunk, huh?
Picture yourself.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.487
(sirens wail in distance)

03:23.662 --> 03:25.323
All yours, if you want it.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.328
— Mnh—mnh. Mnh—mnh.
— Hmm? Oliver gave it to me.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.705
Bastard's trying to get me to break.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.286
(sniffs) Hmm?

03:30.335 --> 03:32.121
No. No. Thank you.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.663
You wanna drive, just let me know.
We can switch.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.958
Why are you being so nice
to me right now?

03:39.010 --> 03:41.968
— I'm a nice guy.
— No, you are not.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.799
What did you hear?

03:44.891 --> 03:47.177
If you don't wanna drive,
just say so.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.519
Well, the weather
has definitely turned.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.853
I've always loved the autumn.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.484
Oh, my God! Okay,
we are taking a break, all right?

03:58.530 --> 04:00.691
Things were moving too fast.
We're slowing it right down.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.857
It's really not the end of the world!

04:02.909 --> 04:04.820
Okay, any more questions?

04:04.870 --> 04:07.077
I didn't ask any questions.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.408
(dispatcher on radio)
1519, we've got a possible B&E

04:09.458 --> 04:11.790
at 11 Hingston Avenue.
Are you 10—8?

04:14.129 --> 04:15.915
1519. We're on our way.

04:18.508 --> 04:19.793
Well, are we going or what?

04:19.843 --> 04:21.708
We're going. We're going.
Look at me go.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.047
(siren wails)

04:23.096 --> 04:26.054
Well, the lock is broken,
unless it was like this before.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.885
No, I know I locked it when I left.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.641
I know, 'cause I always do this thing
to make me remember.

04:30.687 --> 04:34.726
Jazz hands:
Lock the door. Yay, jazz hands!

04:34.775 --> 04:36.731
It's ridiculous,
but it's how I remember.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.937
(chuckles) That's okay.

04:37.986 --> 04:41.570
(exhales deeply) My sister
gets me all worked up.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.230
She hates that | live downtown.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.398
She's paranoid.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.616
House is all clear.
You can go in.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.788
I'm gonna check around the side
and check the alley.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.912
(lowered voice) We got an EDP
wielding a chain saw

04:50.957 --> 04:52.788
at River and Cornwall.
Said we're on our way.

04:52.834 --> 04:53.789
Okay.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.375
All right. You can go back inside.
It's okay.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.002
So you're sure
nothing's missing, huh?

05:01.051 --> 05:04.043
l mean...nothing important.

05:11.311 --> 05:15.054
My undenNear...maybe.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.311
A couple of bras.
A couple of bottoms.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.318
It's expensive,
so I hand—wash it.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.352
You sure it was there?

05:22.405 --> 05:25.238
I'll check in my room,
but this is so weird.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.241
You need to call a locksmith.
Now, okay?

05:28.286 --> 05:30.117
Don't wait until tomorrow.
This is really important.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.121
This guy is very good.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.249
I'm gonna put the occurrence number
on here for you as well.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.671
Do you have somebody
who can stay with you tonight?

05:38.713 --> 05:40.169
I can call my sister,

05:40.215 --> 05:42.297
settle in for a long night
of "I told you so."

05:42.342 --> 05:44.298
Yeah, well, I think
she'll be happy to be here.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.630
Seriously, I'm gonna check up
on you tomorrow, okay?

05:48.515 --> 05:50.301
Uh, actually, you know what?

05:50.350 --> 05:52.511
I'm not leaving until you call her.

05:56.565 --> 05:57.520
There you go.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.102
— Thanks.
— No problem.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.314
Uaughs)

06:03.363 --> 06:04.819
Think you're pretty funny, don't you?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.526
What? I'm just meeting you
for a drink, honey.

06:06.575 --> 06:07.530
You called me.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.286
We need to get our story straight.

06:10.328 --> 06:13.035
Well, can I get a drink first?

06:13.081 --> 06:15.322
Vodka martini,
straight up, olives.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.122
Andy and l...(clears throat)
are taking a little space.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.672
Things were moving too fast.
We're slowing it down.

06:21.715 --> 06:22.830
That's the story.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.215
Okay.

06:25.927 --> 06:26.837
What about us?

06:26.887 --> 06:28.627
I don't know.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.884
You know, 'cause there was
another side to that story

06:31.933 --> 06:32.888
that kinda involves me,

06:32.934 --> 06:35.141
so I guess I'm a little curious
as to how that story ends.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.802
— I don't know.
— Really?

06:37.856 --> 06:39.812
It's gonna have to do.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.726
You set everything on fire,
everything in your life, for me.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.649
She left, and you still need
a little more time?

06:49.659 --> 06:52.571
Luke, I'm the one that got away.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.701
If you want me to stay in the story,
you might want to figure this out.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.755
I'm gonna let you get that.

07:09.721 --> 07:10.836
(Andy) Is this our EDP?

07:10.889 --> 07:12.345
(Noelle) Guess who.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.096
(chain saw revs)

07:14.142 --> 07:17.680
Hey, George. How ya doin'?

07:17.729 --> 07:19.185
Are you ready to come down, huh?

07:19.230 --> 07:20.436
(British accent)
It's not George.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.438
lt's King George.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.725
I mean, you know that.
We've discussed this.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.564
Yes, my mistake.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.446
King George, are you ready
to come down?

07:30.283 --> 07:31.398
Come on, my lord.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.409
l just——| just need
to remove some of this

07:34.454 --> 07:36.570
so that I can see.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.410
Okay. Do me a favor.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.915
Shut that thing off.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.917
Come down here
and meet my partner.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.705
You'll like her.
She's a thinker.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.964
Hey, that's a wonderful offer,
and yet, l'vejust——

07:48.009 --> 07:51.922
Wonderful. I can't climb back down
without dropping this.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.429
— You know, you break it, you buy it.
— (dispatcher on radio, indistinct)

07:54.474 --> 07:56.180
Okay. Fine. I'll buy it.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.682
— You know what? She'll buy it.
— (dispatcher) ...heard a woman screaming.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.059
Copy that. Copy that.
11 Hingston.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.891
You guys were just there.
You have a possible domestic.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.727
— You guys got this?
— Yeah. Yeah.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.267
(siren wails)

08:09.322 --> 08:11.859
Sophie, it's the police!
Open up!

08:11.908 --> 08:13.273
(lowered voice) Come on.
Let's go to the back.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.078
Police!
Sophie, you in there?

08:23.211 --> 08:24.496
Sophie!

08:24.546 --> 08:26.537
lt's Officer McNally!

08:31.177 --> 08:33.008
Sam! Sam!

08:33.054 --> 08:34.464
Come here. She's here.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.675
(Sam) Make sure she's breathing.
l'll clear the second floor.

08:36.725 --> 08:40.013
1519. We need an ambulance
to 11 Hingston.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.517
(dispatcher) Copy, 1519.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.185
(Sam) Top floor's clear!

08:46.234 --> 08:47.770
(dispatcher) EMS is en route.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.233
How's she doing?

08:49.279 --> 08:50.940
She's alive.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.655
(siren wailing in distance)

08:53.700 --> 08:54.815
lt's taking 'em long enough.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.905
Here. Watch that. I'll——
Okay, keep her air——this elevated.

08:57.954 --> 08:58.909
She might have a busted windpipe.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.162
Careful, careful, careful. Easy.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.163
(EMS Tech) It's okay. We got her.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.416
Thanks.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.872
Is she okay?

09:07.756 --> 09:08.791
She's alive.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.455
Great work.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.840
(Jerry) All right, lock down
the street and the alleys.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.001
Yes, sir.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.012
11 Hingston.
We need all available units.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.137
(dispatcher) Copy that.

09:18.183 --> 09:21.550
(Jerry) Okay.
Let's move. Let's move.

09:21.603 --> 09:22.718
(Andy) I asked her
if anything's missing

09:22.771 --> 09:23.726
and she said nothing
except her undenNear,

09:23.772 --> 09:24.852
and even then she wasn't——

09:24.898 --> 09:26.183
UndenNear?
You didn't tell me about that.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.484
Well, I was going to.
It was in my notes.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.266
Okay. No, it's okay.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.276
The undenNear is a hold—back.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.482
What are you talking about?

09:33.531 --> 09:35.647
A detail from a similar crime
we kept out of the press.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.440
You called Callaghan yet?

09:37.494 --> 09:39.610
— Yeah, he's here now.
— Why is Luke here?

09:39.662 --> 09:41.243
(Jerry) Okay. Stay put.

09:41.289 --> 09:44.372
Zoe Martinelli——rookie from 15,
got killed 3 years ago.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.453
Yeah, I know. Luke's big case.
Strangled off—duty.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.915
Friday night, ground—floor apartment,
six blocks from here,

09:48.963 --> 09:50.919
hands and mouth taped
with silver duct tape.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.707
Only thing stolen
was a pair of undenNear.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.297
Guys, I need you to run it
through from the beginning,

09:56.346 --> 09:58.177
calm, cool, slow.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.885
Just talk it through, all right?
Walk me through it.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.390
(police radio chatter)

10:02.435 --> 10:06.019
Okay, first priority——containing
the scene, keeping it clean.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.471
Nash, nobody gets in,
nobody gets out.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.731
It's on you, right?

10:09.776 --> 10:12.188
Okay, the rest of you,
I want you to fan out in teams.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.523
Neighbors, witnesses,
you know the drill.

10:14.572 --> 10:18.156
Be specific.
Details, inconsistencies, huh?

10:18.201 --> 10:20.237
Pay attention.
Write it all down——all of it.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.403
lf Callaghan's right, we're gonna be
looking at Ray Nixon again.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.198
Killed a rookie
from 15 Division 3 years ago

10:26.251 --> 10:27.536
and got away with it.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.665
Okay, let's go get him.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.503
I mean, he must've known her, right?
Zoe Martinelli?

10:32.549 --> 10:33.914
She was a rookie.
She worked with him.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.047
Yeah, but this girl tonight,

10:35.093 --> 10:36.754
I mean, she wasn't a cop.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.759
She was just a girl.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.420
Swarek and Andy
just met with her.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.758
I mean, Andy talked to her.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.764
Yeah, well, Andy's been
pretty distracted lately,

10:43.810 --> 10:45.175
so maybe she missed something.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.344
Like what? I mean,
what could she have missed?

10:47.397 --> 10:48.853
I mean, it sounded like
she did everything right.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.731
If everything had gone right,
do you think we'd be here right now?

10:51.776 --> 10:53.232
— Gail, that's not fair.
— What's not fair?

10:53.278 --> 10:54.609
All right,
let's start with the neighbor,

10:54.654 --> 10:56.394
see if he heard anything,
go from there.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.904
l was working in the basement,
wearing headphones.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.065
I didn't hear a thing.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.733
— Wait, hang on. Is she okay?
— Who?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.401
Sophie, the girl next door.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.739
I figured it was just a break—in.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.029
Happens all the time around here.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.447
You know her?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.115
Not——Not really.
I mean, she seems nice, but...

11:09.169 --> 11:10.454
You didn't see her tonight?

11:10.503 --> 11:12.289
No? There's nothing different?

11:12.338 --> 11:15.045
Nothing...strange?

11:15.091 --> 11:17.548
No. I mean... I don't know.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.084
I saw a guy in the alley.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.344
l was up here getting a beer,
but I'm not even sure what——

11:21.389 --> 11:22.799
Seriously, is she okay?

11:22.849 --> 11:23.929
What'd he look like?

11:23.975 --> 11:28.139
He was a big guy.
Uh, fit. 45, maybe.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.394
Hair, you know...(blows)

11:29.439 --> 11:31.304
Uh, he was wearing gloves.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.143
Well, ljust figured he was
picking through recycling.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.729
I mean, those guys
always wear gloves, right?

11:34.777 --> 11:37.359
(siren)

11:37.405 --> 11:39.111
(Traci) Okay. Thank you for your time,
Mr. Wilson.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.648
(Mr. Wilson)
Oh, no problem.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.535
The perimeter's important.
That's why I put you there.

11:45.580 --> 11:46.865
It's where the answers are.

11:46.915 --> 11:50.078
Really? Because I just talked
to a big man with a little dog

11:50.126 --> 11:51.411
who saw nothing.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.419
Well, slow and steady wins the race.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.079
It worked for me with you, no?

11:57.383 --> 11:59.715
Hey. Looks like we got a witness.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.878
Such a kid.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.387
Maybe he was waiting for us to leave.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.468
Maybe he was still
in the apartment.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.680
He was not in that apartment.
I cleared that apartment.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.185
| just don't really know
what else I could have done.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.017
I mean, I told her
to change the locks.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.476
I even waited for her
to make the call.

12:14.525 --> 12:15.981
I told her I was gonna
come back tomorrow.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.733
It is tomorrow,
and you did come back.

12:17.779 --> 12:18.734
(cell phone rings)

12:18.780 --> 12:20.896
Wait a second.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.485
(Hng)

12:22.533 --> 12:23.909
What?

12:25.536 --> 12:26.992
You want me to do an interview?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.203
Yeah, sure, okay.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.830
ETA's two minutes.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.617
Well, cheer up, McNally.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.535
Callaghan's got an eyeball witness.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.204
And he called you?

12:40.927 --> 12:42.383
You can't be in there.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.214
It'll look biased,
and we need this one to stick.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.505
That's why I handed it off.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.058
Hey, Brendon. How we doing?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.308
l'm Officer Swarek. Um...

12:50.770 --> 12:51.600
Do you want a water?

12:51.646 --> 12:52.681
No, thanks.

12:52.730 --> 12:53.719
Yeah? All right.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.560
Uh...a|| right,
so maybe you saw someone,

12:56.609 --> 12:58.019
maybe you didn't.

12:58.069 --> 13:00.902
Any of these guys
ring a bell for you?

13:00.947 --> 13:02.903
l was in my kitchen,
and he was in the alley.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.064
It was pretty dark.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.735
Okay, well, just...
just take your time.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.493
(Sam) In a case like this,
everything's useful——

13:09.539 --> 13:11.154
descriptions, fibers, footprints,

13:11.207 --> 13:13.038
anything.

13:13.084 --> 13:16.076
(Brendon) Maybe this guy?
Look, it's hard to say.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.665
The guy I saw
wasn't in uniform.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.705
Yeah.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.842
— I need a warrant.
— It's 3:00 in the morning.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.627
And, Luke, we've been here before.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.217
Yeah. We've been here before
with the same guy——

13:28.266 --> 13:29.847
Ray Nixon, the guy I've wanted
all along for this.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.883
And it bit you in the ass
the last time.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.437
Yeah, it bit me in the ass.
Doesn't mean he didn't do it.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.346
Okay? It just means we couldn't
prove it. I couldn't prove it.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.355
A cop gets killed,
and I can't close this case?

13:38.401 --> 13:40.266
I've been wearing that
for three years, Frank.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.022
Get me a warrant.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.979
I'll see what I can do.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.122
So I guess this means Andy and Luke
aren't getting married.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.750
Not this week. This week,
they're taking a little space.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.411
Eh, one big break—up——
every couple gets one.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.921
Hey, that's my line.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.343
You can't steal my theory
when I'm sitting right here.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.250
Wait, so are you saying
that's why she was distracted

14:06.304 --> 14:07.635
when she went
to that woman's house?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.341
She cleared the house.
She called the sister.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.891
What else was she supposed to do?

14:10.933 --> 14:13.060
Well, now we know.
When someone's undenNear gets stolen,

14:13.102 --> 14:14.308
you don't leave them alone.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.890
Rookie lesson.
Live and learn.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.724
— Andy.
— Yeah.

14:17.774 --> 14:18.604
Hey.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.068
Hungry?

14:21.110 --> 14:22.316
Yeah, thanks.

14:23.863 --> 14:24.978
What? Is everything okay?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.567
Yeah.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.736
(Frank) Luke, it's Saturday.
It's still early.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.525
Yeah, we need to get in there
before Nixon knows we're coming.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.034
(Sam) Good.
So let's get ready.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.115
— Please.
— Okay.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.333
Okay. We're waiting
on a search warrant

14:36.376 --> 14:40.164
for one Sergeant Ray Nixon,
43, unmarried.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.579
Decorated veteran,
no criminal record.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.123
Narcissist, control freak,
trophy collector.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.838
(Sam, clears throat)
Primary suspect in the Martinelli murder,

14:47.887 --> 14:49.593
lived a block away from her
at the time.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.722
Eyewitnesses put him near the scene,
but nothing stuck.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.725
The warrant is for apartment,
car——what else?

14:55.770 --> 14:57.431
Office.
It's all on the base.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.345
We're looking for weapons,
duct tape,

14:59.399 --> 15:02.061
undenNear, gloves, journal,
camera, pictures, anything.

15:02.110 --> 15:05.477
We're going in with a couple
of MPs, military police,

15:05.530 --> 15:09.398
so quiet, calm, professional,
in and out, no attitude.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.656
I want in on this.

15:10.701 --> 15:11.986
Bastard's not getting away
with it this time.

15:12.036 --> 15:12.991
Where we at?

15:13.037 --> 15:16.029
As I said,
quiet, calm, no attitude.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.073
Warrant's in. Let's move.

15:26.509 --> 15:29.501
(sirens wailing)

15:39.439 --> 15:40.554
(knock on door)

15:40.606 --> 15:42.562
(Luke) Police. Open up.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.109
(man) Give me a second.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.897
— Can I help you?
— Morning, Ray.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.565
(MP officer) Yeah,
this won't take long, sir.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.733
(sighs) Come on in.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.741
(Luke) Spread out, two to a room.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.742
Morning.

15:55.788 --> 15:56.743
You know what we're looking for.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.327
(Oliver) All right, McNally and Diaz,
you're gonna take the office, all right?

16:00.376 --> 16:01.877
Wow, this guy never gives up.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.500
That was three years ago.

16:03.546 --> 16:06.663
There was no evidence,
and, oh, yeah, I didn't do it.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.047
Check the warrant.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.418
(Oliver) Check up top, too.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.337
Who——Who's Sophie Lewis?

16:14.390 --> 16:16.722
(Luke) Oh, that's the woman
you almost killed last night,

16:16.767 --> 16:18.382
only you didn't quite finish the job.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.551
It's kind of unlike you, Ray.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.435
You must be getting rusty
in your old age.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.600
What are you talking about?

16:23.649 --> 16:26.732
"2300 hours."
2300 hours, l was here.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.438
l was having a beer
with a soldier from my unit.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.819
— Yeah?
— Yeah.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.104
— Really?
— Really.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.772
Give me a name.
We'll check it out.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.406
Private Jane Eddie.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.659
She stopped by for a beer.

16:36.704 --> 16:40.071
She wanted to talk about
her deployment.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.741
She's in barracks.
I'll have her paged.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.046
No, no, no. We can handle it.

16:46.088 --> 16:46.998
Diaz.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.964
(sighs) Look, if you don't mind,

16:51.010 --> 16:52.716
I'm gonna go put some clothes on.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.844
(Luke) Actually, I do mind.

16:54.889 --> 16:55.924
You're gonna stand right there,

16:55.973 --> 16:57.053
and we're gonna
keep searching in here,

16:57.099 --> 16:58.350
then we're gonna go to your office,

16:58.392 --> 17:00.929
then we're gonna go to your car.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.765
So stay put.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.315
We had a beer...

17:05.358 --> 17:07.644
talked about his tours in Bosnia...

17:07.693 --> 17:10.435
told me what to expect
when we got to Panjwaii.

17:10.488 --> 17:11.898
What time did you leave?

17:11.948 --> 17:15.406
Around...midnight.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.032
(sighs)
We're shipping out soon.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.820
My first tour, Afghanistan.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.703
Sarge knows I'm a little nervous.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.999
We had a beer, all right?

17:25.044 --> 17:28.377
That's it. That's all.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.354
All right.
So, uh, 2130 to midnight,

17:47.400 --> 17:48.810
the girl swears they were together.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.815
We know that Sophie
was attacked at 2315,

17:50.861 --> 17:53.398
give or take five minutes, so...

17:55.408 --> 17:59.321
Hey, Ray.
What'd you promise her?

18:00.037 --> 18:00.867
Excuse me?

18:00.913 --> 18:04.952
The girl. Your private.
She's lying for you.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.242
What'd you give her, huh?
Time off? Promotion?

18:08.087 --> 18:09.122
Some undenNear?

18:09.171 --> 18:12.663
(chuckles) Detective, it's not my fault
you can't make your case.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.459
Three years of trying,
I feel sorry for you.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.671
— I really do.
— Easy there, pal.

18:16.721 --> 18:19.337
I'm fine. Relax.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.636
That's a hell of a view.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.926
I could stay here all day.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.061
Detective, stop! Detective!

18:28.107 --> 18:29.813
Keep your comments to yourself, huh?
You know what?

18:29.859 --> 18:31.815
Better yet, keep talking,
you arrogant son of a bitch.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.397
You'll probably give me
something that I could use.

18:53.799 --> 18:54.914
(Andy) What happened?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.377
Turning in my files and going home.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.758
(Andy) Why?

18:59.764 --> 19:01.174
I'm sorry it went this way.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.474
No, you're not.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.225
I'm off the case.
It's all yours, detective.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.438
McNally, grab the others for me.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.520
Parade room, two minutes.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.480
Gail, go get the others.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.070
Detective Rosati would like to
share something with the class.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.872
Nash, I want all this stuff
off the board.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.124
I want to start clean.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.252
Look, I really want to
look at this whole thing fresh.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.628
Okay? No baggage.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.289
You know too much about a case,
it can screw you up.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.128
You get tunnel vision.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.883
So Ray Nixon...

19:40.388 --> 19:42.970
Maybe...maybe not.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.630
What happened to Callaghan?

19:44.684 --> 19:46.470
He made a move
before he was sure.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.884
Now he's taking a little time.

19:47.937 --> 19:51.896
That's the story,
so let's just move on.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.808
What do we have from last night?
What do we actually know?

19:54.860 --> 19:56.441
We have a neighbor
who identified Ray Nixon

19:56.487 --> 19:58.398
in a random stack of photographs.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.610
Random. That picture of Nixon
was in the paper for weeks

20:01.659 --> 20:03.149
after the last time he was arrested.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.362
It's the same neighborhood.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.778
Of course that's
who the kid picked. Next.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.571
Sorry, detective,
but there's a pattern here.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.161
B&E, panty raid, silver duct
tape on the hands and mouth,

20:11.210 --> 20:12.245
attempted strangulation,

20:12.294 --> 20:13.875
six blocks away from
Zoe Martinelli's apartment——

20:13.921 --> 20:16.128
38% of sex offenders
steal undenNear

20:16.173 --> 20:17.629
as a precursor to a bigger crime,

20:17.675 --> 20:19.666
and we're talking about Sophie Lewis.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.009
You can't get Zoe Martinelli
off your brain?

20:23.055 --> 20:24.215
Maybe you need a little break.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.969
Here. Go get us some pizza.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.218
It's gonna be a long day.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.982
(Andy) Anything I can do to help.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.977
All right, moving on.
Nash, you spoke to someone?

20:39.029 --> 20:40.940
Uh...yeah, l, um...

20:40.990 --> 20:45.359
I talked to a guy who was
walking his dog, 2315 to 2330.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.241
And?

20:46.287 --> 20:47.777
Nothing. He saw nothing.

20:47.830 --> 20:51.368
That's good. I like nothing.
Let's start from nothing.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.293
(The British Columbians)
J‘ Going out on you J‘

20:56.338 --> 20:58.499
Hey, Liam, pizzas ready yet?

20:58.632 --> 21:00.884
Hey. Almost out of the oven.
Five more minutes.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.258
— Okay.
— There you go, pal.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.837
Luke's right over there.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.307
How long's he been here?

21:10.352 --> 21:12.729
Don't worry. I'm looking after him.
It's half ice.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.603
Thanks.

21:21.363 --> 21:22.489
Wow.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.396
Really original.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.236
Never claimed to be original.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.573
You know, in another life,
could have had a nice desk job,

21:29.622 --> 21:32.079
a house in the suburbs,

21:32.124 --> 21:34.331
reading about dead people
in the newspaper,

21:34.376 --> 21:37.083
vaguely worrying
about the crime rate.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.462
How's your day, honey?

21:40.508 --> 21:42.874
Oh, my day's been great,
really great.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.259
Yeah, I've been lying
to all my friends this morning,

21:45.304 --> 21:49.513
and now I'm picking up lunch
for the woman that you left me for.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.140
— I didn't leave you.
— Yeah, whatever.

21:52.186 --> 21:53.847
(Liam) Andy. Pizza's ready.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.396
Pooryou.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.766
Seriously, drinking at noon?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.401
Feeling sorry for yourself

22:02.446 --> 22:05.108
while everybody is busting their ass
working on your case?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.273
God, you must be having
a really hard day.

22:08.869 --> 22:09.733
Get a grip.

22:16.418 --> 22:17.282
So what's the plan, then?

22:17.336 --> 22:18.496
I don't know.
My pizza's ready.

22:18.546 --> 22:21.504
Come on, Andy. What's the plan?
Come on. Please.

22:21.549 --> 22:24.461
Okay. You know what?
Nixon's alibi checked out.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.340
Jo's moving on.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.001
She doesn't even think
the two cases are connected.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.294
She's wrong.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.678
Well, listen, l'mjust
telling you what I know.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.850
Andy, she's wrong. She's wrong.
The guy is guilty. Okay?

22:31.892 --> 22:33.302
His alibi is bogus.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.059
He's precise, he's calculated,
and he's a collector.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.141
Everything he's ever done,
anything he's ever taken

22:38.190 --> 22:39.851
is neatly catalogued away
somewhere.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.891
I'd bet my career on that.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.899
You already have.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.285
Eat something.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.582
(police radio chatter,
siren wails)

22:58.627 --> 23:00.242
(door release buzzes, beeps)

23:00.296 --> 23:01.911
So? Sophie Lewis.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.171
Sister says she's single,
not into drugs or alcohol,

23:04.216 --> 23:06.172
and according to Andy's notes,

23:06.218 --> 23:08.504
she had some lingerie stolen, maybe.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.670
"Bra, panties,
thinks she wished them."

23:10.723 --> 23:12.429
She what? "Wished them"?

23:12.474 --> 23:14.135
Sorry. "Washed them."

23:14.184 --> 23:17.051
Okay. Ugh.
I hate the word "panties."

23:17.104 --> 23:18.969
So the sister's here now?

23:19.023 --> 23:21.935
Yeah, Holly Lewis.
She's in there with Jerry.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.316
Okay. I'm gonna
check in with her now.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.192
When McNally gets back
with the food,

23:26.238 --> 23:28.194
I want everyone to take five,
grab a slice,

23:28.240 --> 23:29.776
then we're back out
on the street canvassing.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.111
And they can coordinate
through you. Keep me posted.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.492
Okay.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.120
I can't believe she made you do this.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.955
Yeah, well, that scrawny little bitch
is out of her mind

23:42.004 --> 23:43.790
if she doesn't think
those two cases are connected.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.750
Detective Rosati
put you on pizza duty.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.960
You need to drop the whole
Zoe Martinelli—Ray Nixon thing.

23:48.010 --> 23:51.377
Luke said Ray Nixon attacked
Sophie Lewis. I believe him.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.216
"Luke said"? Bad approach.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.381
Almost as bad as the word "panties."
Jo's on a tear.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.299
What's wrong with the word "panties"?

23:57.353 --> 23:58.559
The panty train's
left the station, all right?

23:58.604 --> 24:00.469
We're starting fresh.

24:00.522 --> 24:01.898
What's going on with the victim?

24:01.941 --> 24:03.101
Well, she's still in critical condition.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.687
It's gonna be a couple days
before we can actually talk to her.

24:05.736 --> 24:07.567
What's that?

24:07.655 --> 24:09.065
Early forensics report.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.275
There was green fiber found
on the duct tape on her wrists.

24:11.325 --> 24:12.940
Consistent with that of a rug
or a carpet,

24:12.993 --> 24:16.110
approximately
half an inch long. Gail?

24:16.163 --> 24:17.778
— Shag?
— Yes.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.446
— Green shag?
— Yes.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.206
— Next door neighbor.
— Yes.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.866
| always like a neighbor
for this kind of thing,

24:22.920 --> 24:24.330
but guy's got no priors,

24:24.380 --> 24:26.211
so, you know,
I want to start small, quiet.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.211
We bring in this Brendon, uh...

24:27.257 --> 24:28.246
Pretak.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.756
Brendon Pretak for official questioning,

24:29.802 --> 24:30.917
we lose the element of surprise.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.005
Yeah, but we can go back there

24:32.054 --> 24:33.169
and say we need to do a follow—up.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.258
Yeah, I could say I lost my notes,
rookie mistake,

24:35.307 --> 24:37.719
you know, forgot to write
something down, missed a detail.

24:37.768 --> 24:38.883
Okay. Uh, yeah.

24:38.936 --> 24:41.143
Epstein, you're the dumb—ass,
and, Peck...

24:41.188 --> 24:43.554
blonde, pretty, lots of makeup,
total nerd bait.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.313
SO that'll help,

24:45.359 --> 24:48.317
but go easy, and take
Shaw and Diaz with you.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.152
Look, sorry to bother you again.

24:54.201 --> 24:57.819
You are a witness now,
and Epstein here...

24:58.789 --> 25:00.120
Rookie lost his notes.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.450
Boss finds out,

25:01.500 --> 25:03.456
he's behind the desk
for the rest of his natural life.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.458
Sorry, man. Ijust need you
to walk me through your night

25:05.504 --> 25:07.165
one more time so I can make
sure I got the whole story,

25:07.965 --> 25:08.829
written down this time.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.622
Okay. I wasjust——
l was in the kitchen,

25:10.676 --> 25:12.007
l was just getting a beer...

25:12.052 --> 25:13.792
Oh, my God.
I love that desk.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.711
l have been looking
for one of these.

25:15.764 --> 25:18.972
Oh, Sally Ann, 20 bucks?

25:20.602 --> 25:22.138
Isn't it awesome, Dov?

25:22.187 --> 25:24.303
So...

25:24.356 --> 25:26.972
Friday night.

25:31.989 --> 25:34.230
You know, ljust want to see
if we missed anything.

25:34.283 --> 25:35.773
Maybe Brendon did it,
maybe he's a copycat,

25:35.826 --> 25:37.942
but either way, I want to talk
to Nixon's witness again.

25:37.995 --> 25:39.986
You're still assuming
the two cases are connected.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.324
— Yes, I am.
— Why?

25:41.373 --> 25:42.362
Because.

25:43.459 --> 25:44.869
Because Luke says so?

25:47.046 --> 25:48.161
I already gave my statement.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.544
I know. Wejust want to
go over it one more time.

25:49.590 --> 25:52.832
Please. I'm leaving in two days.
l have to say my goodbyes.

25:52.885 --> 25:56.503
l have to pack my entire life
into a 9x9 storage locker.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.546
When is this gonna be over?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.633
Okay, you know what?
He's my superior.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.597
I would trust him with my life.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.386
Hell, I'd probably even lie for him,

26:06.440 --> 26:07.520
which is kind of saying a lot,

26:07.566 --> 26:10.899
considering I'm probably one
of the worst liars in the world.

26:12.279 --> 26:16.318
Look, if Sergeant Nixon asked you
to lie for him on Friday night,

26:16.366 --> 26:19.733
| just ask that you would think about
what you could be covering up.

26:20.704 --> 26:21.910
A woman was nearly killed.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.372
Do you want to know
what I lied about?

26:25.417 --> 26:26.918
l was in bed with him.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.034
All night.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.704
Left at 3:00 in the morning.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.543
That's what I lied about.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.878
We'd be dishonorably discharged,

26:35.928 --> 26:38.419
two careers ruined.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.797
I guess that's up to you now.

26:45.771 --> 26:49.434
Hey, does every soldier
have a storage locker?

26:49.483 --> 26:51.724
I mean, they go on tour for,
like, a year, two years.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.062
What do they do with all their stuff?

26:53.112 --> 26:54.693
Okay. Let it go.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.275
Nixon's alibi is even tighter
than it was before. Okay?

26:57.324 --> 26:58.825
Just saying we never checked out
his storage locker.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.949
Because he doesn't have one.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.905
There can't be that many
storage units around here,

27:02.955 --> 27:04.570
so why don't we do
some door—knocking?

27:04.623 --> 27:06.454
You know? No harm, no foul.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.617
Luke says he's definitely
hiding trophies.

27:09.670 --> 27:11.831
We just need to find out where.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.586
Come on. It'll be fun.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.419
Okay. If we're doing this,
you're not driving. Okay?

27:16.468 --> 27:17.844
Why? You were gonna
let me drive last night.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.422
Why are you doing this?

27:19.471 --> 27:20.586
We're wasting our time

27:20.639 --> 27:22.254
trying to pin this on someone
who didn't do it, for what?

27:22.307 --> 27:24.639
A guy who put a ring on your finger,
and then cheated on you?

27:24.685 --> 27:28.269
What? How do you——
How do you know that?

27:37.197 --> 27:38.903
You can spin the story
any way you want.

27:38.949 --> 27:41.611
Anybody who cares about you
is gonna figure it out pretty fast.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.281
Yeah, but that doesn't change
what he knows.

27:46.123 --> 27:46.987
I believe him.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.702
All right, well...
believe whatever you want.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.366
I'm gonna walk back to the station.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.374
I could use a little space.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.288
Sam, I...

28:07.436 --> 28:10.803
(keystrokes, beeping)

28:12.900 --> 28:14.731
(sighs) Hi.

28:14.776 --> 28:17.267
Yeah, this is Officer McNally
from the 15 Division.

28:17.321 --> 28:20.404
Trying to locate
a Sergeant Ray Nixon.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.030
l was wondering
if you had any storage lockers

28:22.075 --> 28:23.576
registered under that name.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.326
Are you sure?

28:27.372 --> 28:29.112
Yeah, Nixon. N—l—X...

28:29.166 --> 28:30.155
(click)

28:30.209 --> 28:31.039
Hello?

28:37.758 --> 28:39.714
Hi. Yes.
This is Officer McNally.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.250
You just hung up on me.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.588
l know——Fine...

28:42.638 --> 28:46.051
Okay, there's no Ray Nixon.
What about a Sophie Lewis?

28:47.893 --> 28:52.011
Okay. Uh, Zoe Martinelli?

28:55.025 --> 28:58.142
Yeah, M—A—R—T...Martinelli.

28:58.946 --> 28:59.901
Yes, okay, great.

28:59.947 --> 29:03.030
I'll be over there
in just a second. Thanks, bye.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.400
Carpet's gone.
Neighbor ripped it out.

29:06.453 --> 29:07.863
No more green fibers.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.028
Looks like he brought
industrial cleaners,

29:09.081 --> 29:11.037
'cause the place was spotless.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.539
Yeah. Diaz is sitting
on the neighbor's house.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.449
lf Pretak moves, we're gonna know it.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.039
Okay, well,
the guy could be renovating,

29:16.088 --> 29:18.204
rethinking his aesthetic.
It's all circumstantial.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.293
Or he could be tying up a noose,
loading a handgun.

29:20.342 --> 29:22.879
I prefer getting him alive,
but, hey, that's just me.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.385
Okay. Yeah.
You're absolutely right. Let's do it.

29:25.430 --> 29:26.545
Where's McNally?

29:27.808 --> 29:30.220
She's out getting me a decent coffee.
Why? You want one?

29:30.269 --> 29:33.853
Yes. I knew that you would break,
brother. I knew it!

29:33.897 --> 29:36.388
(Jo, on phone) Detective Rosati.
I need to talk to Duke.

29:37.359 --> 29:39.475
Bill gets paid every month in cash.

29:39.528 --> 29:40.734
That's pretty damn miraculous,

29:40.779 --> 29:44.021
considering Zoe Martinelli
was murdered three years ago.

29:44.157 --> 29:45.567
Guess you don't read the papers.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.357
Look, I don't know
what you've got in there,

29:47.411 --> 29:52.030
but if you guys are withholding
DNA evidence, drugs, weapons...

29:52.082 --> 29:54.198
Well, how were we
supposed to know?

29:57.129 --> 29:59.666
All right. You know what?
It's not even your fault.

29:59.715 --> 30:01.876
If I come up with anything...

30:01.925 --> 30:03.381
I'll come find you.

30:03.427 --> 30:04.917
Thank you.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.561
All right. So the guy keeps
coming out with garbage bags,

30:58.607 --> 30:59.722
and he's putting them
in other people's bins.

31:00.567 --> 31:01.773
Where is he now?

31:01.818 --> 31:03.228
Haven't seen him. He hasn't
come out in about 20 minutes.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.064
Last I saw him,
he was in the back room.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.756
Okay.

31:26.802 --> 31:28.542
Here we go.

32:02.546 --> 32:04.036
(whispers) Oh, crap.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.001
(cell phone rings)

32:11.054 --> 32:12.635
— Hello?
— (Andy) Luke.

32:12.681 --> 32:13.761
Andy, I need to see you.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.763
No, you need to get
a warrant right now.

32:15.809 --> 32:18.801
I'm at Vessel Storage,
Parliament and Richmond.

32:18.854 --> 32:22.312
The locker number is C1084.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.063
The name's under Zoe Martinelli.

32:24.109 --> 32:26.225
— What are you talking about?
— It's Nixon.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.735
He's keeping everything here——
everything you said.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.896
Just hurry up
and get the warrant, okay?

32:30.949 --> 32:32.450
I do not want to screw this up.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.153
Okay, okay, I'm calling it in.
You just stay put, all right?

32:34.202 --> 32:35.317
I'm on my way.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.326
(beeping)

32:38.248 --> 32:39.363
I need Frank.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.719
Police!
We have a warrant!

33:26.004 --> 33:27.210
(Jo) Brendon Pretak,
you're under arrest

33:27.255 --> 33:29.246
for the attempted murder
of Sophie Lewis.

33:31.468 --> 33:32.958
(Jerry) I'll run the interview.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.267
(voice mail) Hey. You've reached Andy.
Leave a message.

33:46.316 --> 33:47.806
Andy, we're just waiting
on the warrant, all right?

33:47.859 --> 33:49.690
Call me back.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.503
(Nixon) I'm working on it, all right?

34:20.809 --> 34:23.642
Just give me a second here. Shh!

34:25.564 --> 34:27.054
Okay.

34:27.107 --> 34:30.941
Get her out of here...
come back, clean up...

34:31.486 --> 34:32.566
and clear everything out.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.029
It's not perfect.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.575
All right, sergeant.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.906
Two days.

34:41.955 --> 34:45.322
Two days and I'm gone.

34:49.462 --> 34:50.963
Okay, sergeant.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.833
Let's do this thing.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.513
You know...you know...

35:02.559 --> 35:04.049
It's funny.

35:04.102 --> 35:08.061
You're a soldier, but it's always
different up close, huh?

35:09.733 --> 35:11.519
Close your eyes.

35:12.986 --> 35:14.192
Close your eyes!

35:15.113 --> 35:16.353
That's an order!

35:21.620 --> 35:22.951
(tape ripping)

35:26.833 --> 35:29.199
(muffled shouts)

35:30.587 --> 35:33.329
Don't move! Don't move,
you son of a bitch!

35:33.381 --> 35:34.712
Don't move!

35:34.758 --> 35:36.089
(sobs)

35:36.134 --> 35:40.047
Stand up...
slowly...slowly.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.757
Hands behind your head.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.297
Do it.
Hands behind your head.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.511
Step fonNard.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.771
One step. Slowly!

35:53.151 --> 35:55.267
One more step. Slow!

35:55.320 --> 35:57.982
Slow! Stop!

36:06.456 --> 36:09.072
Take one step back, slowly.

36:09.125 --> 36:10.456
Slow.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.117
Stop.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.161
(handcuffs jangling)

36:18.343 --> 36:19.753
Put your left hand down.

36:19.803 --> 36:23.546
Left hand down slowly
behind your back. Slowly!

36:49.165 --> 36:50.450
Stay down!

36:50.500 --> 36:51.831
Stay down!

37:02.804 --> 37:04.419
Stay there.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.087
(whimpers)

37:06.141 --> 37:07.927
It's me. It's me.

37:07.976 --> 37:10.558
I'm gonna take it off, okay?

37:10.603 --> 37:13.640
All right.
It's me, it's me.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.555
Look at me.
Look at me.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.769
Okay? Okay.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.184
(sobs)

37:19.237 --> 37:20.522
(whispers) Look at me.

37:20.572 --> 37:24.030
Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

37:25.618 --> 37:27.745
(whispers) Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.036
Alicia Makin.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.871
Yes.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.956
Private Sabrina Bryant.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.371
Yes.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.881
Officer Zoe Martinelli.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.303
Yes.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.221
Sophie Lewis.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.381
— No.
— Ray.

37:49.434 --> 37:51.925
No. That was amateur.
He didn't even finish.

37:53.062 --> 37:56.054
He was trying to be me.
He probably read about me in the papers.

37:56.107 --> 37:59.065
Good for him,
but he didn't finish his job.

37:59.110 --> 38:02.193
He left evidence at the scene.
He left traces.

38:02.238 --> 38:03.523
— Pathetic——
— Okay.

38:04.491 --> 38:06.231
Okay.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.779
Long as we're clear.

38:08.828 --> 38:11.114
Yeah. Yeah, we're clear.

38:11.164 --> 38:12.404
Good.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.284
Let's move on.

38:14.334 --> 38:16.700
(sighs)

38:17.921 --> 38:19.206
I'm sorry I left you.

38:19.255 --> 38:20.916
It's okay.

38:22.217 --> 38:23.627
Someone taking you home?

38:23.676 --> 38:26.008
Yeah, I'm gonna get a ride
with Traci.

38:26.054 --> 38:29.091
Andy, you can't stay at your dad's.
I've been to your dad's.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.880
Fine, then I'll...

38:30.934 --> 38:32.424
I'll stay at Traci's.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.266
His lawyer's gonna be here soon.
We should get back in there.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.650
Can you believe this guy?

38:42.695 --> 38:44.435
I've never met anybody
more arrogant.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.354
I mean, he had a locker
under Zoe's name. Who does that?

38:46.407 --> 38:47.738
What's going on with the neighbor?

38:47.784 --> 38:50.150
Oh, Jerry's got him.
Kid's crying like a baby.

38:50.203 --> 38:55.618
Copycat, pervert, easiest——
easiest interrogation ever.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.623
You and I will be done
before the sun comes up.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.079
So?

38:59.128 --> 39:01.540
So I'm just saying...
Uaughs)

39:02.215 --> 39:03.125
She believed me.

39:03.967 --> 39:04.877
— Who?
— Andy.

39:06.386 --> 39:09.093
After everything, us,
she believed me, and what I knew.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.139
Luke, I was doing myjob.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.970
You just couldn't wait, could you?

39:16.271 --> 39:17.852
Same as it ever was.

39:19.566 --> 39:22.228
I've made a lot of mistakes,
but this is by far the worst.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.855
I want her back, and I want you gone.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.409
(voice breaking)
Okay. Then I'm gone.

39:40.587 --> 39:41.872
(door opens)

39:45.216 --> 39:46.626
(door closes)

39:46.676 --> 39:49.668
(Hey Rosetta's "Red Song" playing)

39:54.142 --> 39:56.303
We'll put you on the couch.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.890
lt pulls out, but it's comfortable.

39:59.939 --> 40:02.476
And the sheets are clean,
but that's not me.

40:02.525 --> 40:05.517
That's my mom. She always
makes sure the sheets are clean.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.771
(voice breaking)
Luke slept with Jo.

40:11.868 --> 40:13.733
I know.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.202
J‘ In the black, | feel you J‘

40:17.248 --> 40:19.079
I'm really tired.

40:22.754 --> 40:23.618
I know.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.582
J‘ In the black, I sense J‘

40:29.010 --> 40:32.377
J‘ Somewhere in the red J‘

40:32.430 --> 40:36.719
J‘ The colors end J‘
