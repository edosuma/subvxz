WEBVTT

00:08.007 --> 00:09.943
YOU HAVE TO
LEARN TO STOP

00:10.009 --> 00:11.978
THE SENSELESS
KILLINGS !

00:12.045 --> 00:14.414
THE PEOPLE I KILL
DESERVE TO DIE.

00:16.883 --> 00:18.184
OH, SWEET JESUS.

00:18.251 --> 00:19.719
I'M GONNA KILL
THAT FUCKER

00:19.786 --> 00:21.621
FOR WHAT HE DID HERE,
TO MY PARTNER.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.190
BURKE, WAIT
FOR BACKUP !

00:31.698 --> 00:32.732
HEY, BUDDY...

00:32.799 --> 00:35.668
I SHOT THE BASTARD
POINT-BLANK, WYNN.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.370
NOT EVEN THE DOCTORS
HAVE FIGURED OUT

00:37.437 --> 00:38.772
HOW HE PULLED
THROUGH.

00:38.838 --> 00:41.141
I DON'T REMEMBER,
I FEEL SHATTERED.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.409
I'M LOOKING
FOR A MAN,

00:42.475 --> 00:44.844
HE WEARS
A RED SHROUD.

00:44.911 --> 00:47.881
WHO IS IT THAT
SEEKS THE SHROUD ?

00:47.947 --> 00:49.549
JADE ?

00:49.616 --> 00:53.052
YOU WERE THE ONLY
HELL SPAWN TO ESCAPE ME.

00:53.119 --> 00:54.254
YOU LOOK A
LITTLE SPOOKED.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.524
SHE HUNTED
ME AS WELL.

00:57.590 --> 01:00.427
... HAS SENT
THEIR BOUNTY HUNTER.

01:00.493 --> 01:03.530
AND NOW SHE
WANTS YOUR HEAD.

01:03.596 --> 01:05.565
LET HER COME.

01:06.399 --> 01:10.403

ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.936
NO !

02:13.266 --> 02:15.301
THE WORLD HAS BEEN
PLAGUED BY DEMONS

02:15.368 --> 02:17.303
FROM ACROSS
THE CENTURIES.

02:17.370 --> 02:20.340
GENGHIS KHAN,
ATTILA THE HUN...

02:20.406 --> 02:22.375
... HITLER.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.110
AND WHEN THE GREAT BATTLE
OF ARMAGEDDON COMES,

02:24.177 --> 02:26.713
WHO DOES GOD SEND
TO PROTECT US ?

02:26.779 --> 02:28.948
AND WHAT MUST THOSE
ANGELS BE LIKE ?

02:29.015 --> 02:31.117
WILLING TO BATTLE WITH
THE SAME SAVAGENESS

02:31.184 --> 02:33.319
AS THOSE THEY'VE
SWORN TO KILL ?

02:33.386 --> 02:35.622
AND WHAT ARE WE
LEFT WITH THEN ?

02:35.688 --> 02:38.057
MONSTERS
KILLING MONSTERS ?

02:38.124 --> 02:40.226
WHO'S GOOD
AND WHO'S EVIL ?

02:40.293 --> 02:42.328
MAYBE, IT'S
JUST A MATTER

02:42.395 --> 02:44.197
OF WHAT SIDE
YOU'RE SITTING ON.

02:55.074 --> 02:57.844
( Cogliostro )
WHEN THE FULL MOON CAME,

02:57.911 --> 03:01.548
THE HELL SPAWN
STARED AT IT,

03:01.614 --> 03:03.883
FOR A LONG TIME.

03:03.950 --> 03:07.954
IS IT EXPECTING
TO DISCOVER SOME TRUTH

03:08.021 --> 03:11.658
IN ITS COLD
STILLNESS ?

03:11.724 --> 03:13.626
CLARITY, MAYBE ?

03:13.693 --> 03:16.462
A MEASURE
OF PEACEFULNESS ?

03:16.529 --> 03:20.199
THINGS HE HADN'T
KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME.

03:20.266 --> 03:23.670
BUT THE MOON ONLY
BROUGHT HIM TO HIS WORLD...

03:23.736 --> 03:25.805
( pleading )

03:25.872 --> 03:27.473
... MORE SAVAGENESS.

03:30.043 --> 03:34.514
YOU SEE, THIS
IS BUSINESS, LAKESHA.

03:34.581 --> 03:37.116
IF YOU'RE NOT WORKING
FOR ME, I LOSE MONEY.

03:37.183 --> 03:40.887
WHY YOU TURN TRICKS
FOR THOSE FUCKIN'
RUSSIANS ?

03:40.954 --> 03:43.222
I TREATED YOU
LIKE MY QUEEN.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.725
I'M NOT STUPID,
I SEE THROUGH YOU.

03:45.792 --> 03:48.394
YOU THINK THOSE NICE CLOTHES
AND FANCY TALK

03:48.461 --> 03:50.263
MAKES YOU BETTER
THAN ME ?

03:50.330 --> 03:51.831
YOU'RE MORE WHORE
THAN I AM,

03:51.898 --> 03:53.499
YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A COWARD !

04:01.407 --> 04:04.143
IS THIS
WHAT YOU DO ?

04:04.210 --> 04:06.379
YOU KILL PEOPLE
WITH THESE THINGS ?

04:08.481 --> 04:10.383
YOU'RE NOT A HERO,

04:10.450 --> 04:12.585
YOU'RE A COWARD.

04:13.753 --> 04:14.954
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE !

04:15.021 --> 04:16.889
WANDA, I...

04:16.956 --> 04:19.192
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO YOU ARE ANYMORE.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.298
( thug )
SO, CHARLES,

04:25.365 --> 04:26.933
WHAT DO YOU WANT
US TO DO WITH HER ?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.268
( Charles )
SHE JUST RETIRED,
CUT HER UP.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.239
( sirens )

04:33.306 --> 04:35.608
SEE YOU AROUND,

04:45.718 --> 04:47.120

I REMEMBER
THIS ONE.

04:47.186 --> 04:48.588
WE BUSTED HER A
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

04:48.655 --> 04:49.922
IS THAT YOU
LAKESHA ?

04:49.989 --> 04:52.859
I KNOW WHO DID THIS,
IT WAS CHARLES, WASN'T IT ?

04:52.925 --> 04:54.594
NOT FOR NOTHING,

04:54.661 --> 04:56.629
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET HIM
BEAT ON YOU LIKE THAT.

04:56.696 --> 04:57.864
C'MON, LAKESHA,

04:57.930 --> 04:59.132
WANNA MAKE
A STATEMENT
THIS TIME ?

04:59.198 --> 05:01.134
LAKESHA, HELP US PUT
HIS BLACK ASS IN JAIL,

05:01.200 --> 05:02.635
WHERE IT BELONGS.

05:02.702 --> 05:05.705
ARE YOU GONNA BRING
FLOWERS TO MY GRAVE ?

05:05.772 --> 05:07.907

05:20.019 --> 05:23.222
( Charles )
SHE IS SO INNOCENT, FRESH.

05:23.289 --> 05:25.358
THE HOMECOMING QUEEN

05:25.425 --> 05:28.127
WHO CAME TO NEW YORK
TO BE A STAR.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.135
JESUS, YOU KNOW
THE DRILL.

05:36.202 --> 05:37.370
SURE.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.373
OH, TRICKS ARE GONNA
TEAR INTO HER.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.075
( Jesus )
WHERE YOU GOING,
SWEETHEART ?

05:42.141 --> 05:43.943

05:44.010 --> 05:45.945
HEY !

05:47.380 --> 05:48.614
BEAT IT !

05:48.681 --> 05:50.483
OR I'LL GUT YOU
LIKE A FISH !

05:51.951 --> 05:53.619
YOU HAVE TO BE
CAREFUL, MISS,

05:53.686 --> 05:55.354
THIS IS NEW YORK.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.190
YOU JUST DON'T TALK
TO SLEAZOIDS LIKE HIM.

05:57.256 --> 06:00.259
I WAS HOPING TO GET
SOME DIRECTIONS.

06:00.326 --> 06:04.263
I'M REALLY HUNGRY, AND
I NEED A PLACE TO STAY.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.034
HEY, ARE YOU GUYS

DINNER, WILL YOU ?

06:15.508 --> 06:16.809

GOOD LUCK, MISS.

06:20.079 --> 06:21.814
IF YOU NEED ANY HELP,
JUST CALL ME.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.916
YOU'RE REALLY NICE.

06:23.983 --> 06:25.885
AND THEY TOLD ME
THAT NEW YORKERS

06:25.952 --> 06:28.721
MIGHT TRY TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF A GIRL.

06:33.659 --> 06:35.361
( chuckling )

06:38.097 --> 06:39.932
( Jesus )
YOU'RE A LONG WAY
FROM THE STICKS.

06:39.999 --> 06:43.436
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?

06:43.503 --> 06:44.604
LILLY.

06:44.670 --> 06:47.073
LILLY, LIKE IN
LILLY WHITE ASS.

06:57.216 --> 06:59.051
( screaming )

07:20.873 --> 07:22.742
THE DOCTOR
FILLED ME IN.

07:22.809 --> 07:24.477
TOLD ME HE'S NOT SURE
WHAT THE REAL DAMAGE IS

07:24.544 --> 07:26.045
UNTIL THE SWELLING
GOES DOWN.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.313
HEY, TWITCH IS FINE.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.848
HE'LL BE ON
THE STREETS
IN NO TIME.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.417
HEY, THAT'S FOR ME
TO DECIDE, DETECTIVE.

07:31.484 --> 07:32.852
ACCORDING TO
THE DOCTOR,

07:32.919 --> 07:35.588
YOUR PARTNER IS
EXPERIENCING
MEMORY LOSS.

07:35.655 --> 07:36.889
THAT'S BULLSHIT !

07:36.956 --> 07:40.426
WHAT HE NEEDS IS REST,
NOT VISITORS.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.430
HOW ARE YOU,
DETECTIVE ?

07:44.497 --> 07:46.098
YOU'RE PROBABLY
GETTING TIRED OF

07:46.165 --> 07:48.067
PEOPLE ASKING
YOU THAT.

07:55.575 --> 07:58.845
THANK YOU FOR
COMING, CHIEF.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.479
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,

08:00.546 --> 08:02.949
I KNOW THIS MEDAL OF
BRAVERY IS NOT MUCH

08:03.015 --> 08:04.817
COMPARED TO WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH

08:04.884 --> 08:06.752
AND WHAT YOU'VE
SACRIFICED FOR THE CITY.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.955
PLEASE ACCEPT IT AS
A TOKEN OUR GRATITUDE.

08:09.021 --> 08:11.624
YOU'VE DONE WELL,
OFFICER.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.460
THE DEPARTMENT
IS PROUD OF YOU.

08:16.529 --> 08:17.763
AHH !

08:17.830 --> 08:20.132
WELL, I GUESS
I'LL BE GOING.

08:20.199 --> 08:22.568
HE NEEDS HIS REST.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.470
YOU OKAY,
TWITCH ?

08:26.739 --> 08:28.140

08:33.412 --> 08:35.081
MOVE !

08:37.216 --> 08:38.651
JESUS.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.532
JASON WYNN SAID
HE WOULD CALL YOU.

08:53.599 --> 08:55.268
YES, WE SPOKE.

08:55.334 --> 08:58.070
HE'S VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT YOUR OFFICER.

08:58.137 --> 09:00.673
I'M GOING TO HANDLE
HIS CARE PERSONALLY.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.109
IN A SITUATION
LIKE THIS,

09:03.175 --> 09:05.011
EPINEPHRINE
IS VERY EFFECTIVE.

09:05.077 --> 09:06.545
YOU GOTTA BE CAREFUL.

09:06.612 --> 09:08.748
A LARGE DOSE CAN CAUSE
THE HEART TO BEAT SO FAST

09:08.814 --> 09:11.017
IT TEARS
ITSELF APART.

09:13.419 --> 09:15.454
( Burke snoring )

09:18.424 --> 09:21.427
ANOTHER SHOT ?
WHAT IS IT ?

09:21.494 --> 09:23.763
SOMETHING TO
HELP YOU SLEEP.

09:23.829 --> 09:26.332
YOU'VE HAD
SOME RESTLESS
NIGHTS, OFFICER.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.068
I'VE BEEN
HAVING NIGHTMARES.

09:29.135 --> 09:32.672
THIS IS GONNA MAKE YOUR
HEART RACE A LITTLE AT FIRST,

09:32.738 --> 09:34.440
BUT THAT'S NORMAL.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.976
WAIT, I DON'T
WANT THE SHOT.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.644
( phone )

09:39.946 --> 09:42.048
CAN'T YOU GIVE THIS
MAN SOME PEACE ?

09:42.114 --> 09:43.783
YOU WAKE HIM UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

09:43.849 --> 09:45.484
TO SEE IF
HE'S SLEEPING ?

09:45.551 --> 09:47.086
STOP POKING HIM
ALL THE TIME,

09:47.153 --> 09:49.055
HE'S NOT A DAMN
PIN CUSHION !

09:49.121 --> 09:51.958
THIS IS BURKE... TWO ?

09:52.024 --> 09:53.759
WHEN ?

09:53.826 --> 09:55.094
DIDN'T I TELL YOU ?

09:55.161 --> 09:57.730
ANYTHING IN THE ALLEYS,
YOU CALL ME FIRST.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.265
AND NO ONE TOUCHES
A FUCKING THING

09:59.332 --> 10:00.766
UNTIL I GET THERE.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.569
THEY FOUND TWO MORE
DEAD BODIES IN THE ALLEY.

10:03.636 --> 10:05.871
LEG-BREAKERS FOR
A PIMP DOWNTOWN.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.007
THEIR THROATS
RIPPED OUT.

10:08.074 --> 10:11.043
NEAR WHERE
YOU WERE POPPED.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.678
IT'S NOT ENOUGH
THE BASTARD SHOOTS YOU,

10:12.745 --> 10:14.613
NOW HE'S RUBBING
MY FACE IN IT.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.351
I HAVE TO SEE IT.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.052
MAYBE I'LL
REMEMBER SOMETHING.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.620
WHOA, HOLD ON.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.789
GET YOUR SCRAWNY ASS
BACK IN BED.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.958
YOU STILL GOT HALF
A BULLET IN YOUR BRAIN.

10:26.025 --> 10:27.626
THEY'RE NOT
JUST GONNA LET YOU GO,

10:27.693 --> 10:28.995
YOU HAVE TO
SIGN SOMETHING.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.429
LET THEM
OFF THE HOOK.

10:30.496 --> 10:32.898
I DON'T REMEMBER
HOW TO SIGN MY NAME.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.134
THAT'S
FUCKING GREAT.

10:36.635 --> 10:38.571
OKAY, BUT WHEN WE GET
TO THE CRIME SCENE,

10:38.637 --> 10:40.006
LET ME DO
THE TALKING.

10:42.074 --> 10:46.178
( bells chiming )

10:48.814 --> 10:50.549
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

10:50.616 --> 10:53.686
WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE ?

10:53.753 --> 10:55.955
WANDA...

10:56.022 --> 10:58.657
ALL I WANTED WAS
TO TOUCH HER AGAIN.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.659
SHE SAW YOU FOR
WHAT YOU ARE ?

11:00.726 --> 11:02.261
NO...

11:02.328 --> 11:03.763
TERRY IS
HER HUSBAND.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.231
SHE THINKS SHE
SLEPT WITH HIM.

11:05.297 --> 11:08.100
YOU COME BACK FROM HELL
TO RECLAIM YOUR WIFE ?

11:08.167 --> 11:10.770
THIS WOMAN WHO MEANS
EVERYTHING TO YOU

11:10.836 --> 11:12.938
AND YOU MAKE LOVE
TO HER IN THE BODY

11:13.005 --> 11:14.640
OF ANOTHER MAN ?

11:14.707 --> 11:15.841
SHE NEVER
HAS TO KNOW.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.309
<i>YOU</i> KNOW.

11:17.376 --> 11:19.211
WHERE IS
YOUR HONOR ?

11:19.278 --> 11:20.579
HONOR ?

11:20.646 --> 11:22.648
WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT HONOR ?

11:22.715 --> 11:26.018
I'VE READ
THE INSCRIPTION
ON YOUR TOMB.

11:26.085 --> 11:29.121
THE BLACK KNIGHT PROVIDED
A FEAST OF SOULS

11:29.188 --> 11:30.623
FOR MALEBOLGIA.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.658
HE KILLED FOR
THE PLEASURE OF IT.

11:32.725 --> 11:36.962
YES, I KILLED
WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.165
I SHOWED NO MERCY.

11:39.231 --> 11:43.436
I HAVE HAD 800 YEARS
TO CHANGE MY HEART,

11:43.502 --> 11:46.672
AND STILL
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH

11:46.739 --> 11:49.075
TO WASH AWAY
WHAT I'VE DONE.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.377
YOU THINK YOU
CAN SAVE ME ?

11:51.444 --> 11:55.448
IF I CAN BRING ONE HELL SPAWN
BACK TO HUMANITY,

11:55.514 --> 11:58.117
I CAN REST.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.719
WIN YOUR POINTS
ON SOMEONE ELSE.

12:00.786 --> 12:02.555
I'M FINISHED HERE.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.590
LET HIM TAKE ME
BACK TO HELL.

12:04.657 --> 12:08.094
I HAVE NOTHING LEFT
TO GIVE EXCEPT TO YOU.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.830
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN
TAKEN FROM ME.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.499
EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER
LOVED AND CHERISHED

12:13.566 --> 12:16.435
IS DEAD, GONE,
A LONG TIME AGO.

12:16.502 --> 12:20.439
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO,
LOST IN THE PAST.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.108
WHY DO YOU
GO ON ?

12:22.174 --> 12:25.311
I WANT MY
HONOR BACK !

12:25.377 --> 12:28.080
LET MALEBOLGIA
TAKE MY SOUL,

12:28.147 --> 12:31.217
I CAN'T DIE
WITHOUT MY HONOR !

12:33.919 --> 12:35.321
( cop )
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS ?

12:35.387 --> 12:36.722
IT'S A SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

12:36.789 --> 12:38.023
( cop #2 )
THESE TWO WORK
FOR CHARLES.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.258
MAYBE IT'S
A MOB THING.

12:39.325 --> 12:42.394
CHARLES TOOK THIS TURF
FROM THE RUSSIANS...

12:42.461 --> 12:44.330
HEY, HERE COMES
BURKE AND WILLIAMS.

12:44.396 --> 12:46.699
WHAT'S EVERYBODY
STANDING AROUND FOR ?

12:46.765 --> 12:48.534
LET'S GET THESE
LOOKY-LU'S OUTTA HERE !

12:48.601 --> 12:50.302
LET'S MOVE IT !

12:50.369 --> 12:52.204
( cop )
YOU GOT IT,
DETECTIVE.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.807
WHICH WAY IS THE CORONER
GONNA GO WITH THIS GUY ?

12:54.874 --> 12:58.344
CAUSE OF DEATH,
WILD DOGS.

12:58.410 --> 13:00.579
BUT YOU DON'T
BELIEVE THAT.

13:00.646 --> 13:02.181
IN A LOGICAL WORLD

13:02.248 --> 13:04.283
THAT WOULD BE A
REASONABLE CALL.

13:04.350 --> 13:07.286
THEY WERE BOTH CLAWED,
TORN OPEN.

13:07.353 --> 13:10.723
AND THERE ARE FANG MARKS
ON THE SCALP, NECK,

13:10.789 --> 13:13.159
SHOULDERS, AND CHEST.

13:13.225 --> 13:14.994
NO DAMN DOG
IS THIS POWERFUL.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.362
THESE GUYS WERE
TOSSED AROUND

13:16.428 --> 13:17.863
LIKE RAG DOLLS.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.265
IT'S HIM.

13:19.331 --> 13:21.400
( Wu )
WHO'S HIM,
TWITCH ?

13:21.467 --> 13:24.270
BEAT IT,
WILL YOU ?

13:24.336 --> 13:26.272
GET BACK THERE
BEHIND THE TAPE

13:26.338 --> 13:27.973
WITH THE OTHER
VULTURES !

13:28.040 --> 13:29.608
HEY, WHERE THE HELL
ARE THE FORENSIC GUYS ?

13:29.675 --> 13:31.911
I DON'T WANNA BE
OUT HERE ALL NIGHT !

13:33.612 --> 13:35.814
I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU BACK TO WORK,

13:35.881 --> 13:37.383
OFFICER WILLIAMS.

13:37.449 --> 13:39.485
I HEARD YOU GOT
HIT PRETTY HARD.

13:39.552 --> 13:40.986
THE LAST TIME
WE SPOKE

13:41.053 --> 13:42.688
IT WAS IN THE COP
BAR, RIGHT ?

13:42.755 --> 13:44.390
YOU WERE LOOKING
IN THE ALLEYS

13:44.456 --> 13:45.958
FOR A GUY IN
A RED CAPE.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.960
( Spawn )
IF YOU PLAY
WITH MATCHES

13:48.027 --> 13:49.962
YOU CAN GET BURNED.

13:51.430 --> 13:54.266
I HEARD HE'S
THE PRIME SUSPECT
IN YOUR SHOOTING.

13:56.268 --> 13:58.304
YOU THINK
HE DID THIS ?

13:58.370 --> 14:00.306
OFFICER WILLIAMS ?

14:00.372 --> 14:03.075
( Burke )
NO STATEMENTS UNTIL
THE AUTOPSIES ARE DONE,

14:03.142 --> 14:04.043
OKAY ?

14:04.109 --> 14:05.411
WHATEVER
YOU SAY, SAM.

14:05.477 --> 14:07.112
WERE THESE GUYS
KILLED HERE

14:07.179 --> 14:08.447
OR JUST DUMPED ?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.849
CAN YOU AT LEAST
THROW ME A BONE ?

14:11.917 --> 14:15.254
THE FIRST ONE WAS
KILLED RIGHT HERE.

14:15.321 --> 14:18.123
HE FIRED TWICE
AS THEY STRUGGLED.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.226
( Burke )
IT'S WEIRD HOW THEIR
NECKS HAVE BEEN TORN OPEN.

14:20.292 --> 14:21.794
BUT THERE'S NO
BLOOD ON THE SNOW.

14:21.860 --> 14:24.063
NO BLOOD
ON THE BODIES.

14:24.129 --> 14:25.764
THEY WERE
LICKED CLEAN.

14:25.831 --> 14:29.468
WELL, WE DON'T
REALLY KNOW THAT.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.404
SO, YOU DON'T
SPILL A DROP OF
INK ABOUT THIS.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.039
I DON'T WANT
THIS HEADLINE

14:34.106 --> 14:36.408
SHOWIN' UP IN
MY DOG'S MOUTH
IN THE MORNING.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.945
WHAT ARE
THOSE PATTERNS

14:40.012 --> 14:41.981
IN THE SNOW
AROUND THE BODY ?

14:42.047 --> 14:43.649
I REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS KID,

14:43.716 --> 14:46.885
IN WINTER, WE'D THROW
HOT CARAMEL ON THE SNOW.

14:46.952 --> 14:49.121
IT HARDENED INTO
A THIN SHEET

14:49.188 --> 14:51.290
AND WE ATE IT
LIKE CANDY.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.759
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE BLOOD.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.661
WHEN HIS AORTA
WAS SEVERED,

14:55.728 --> 14:57.363
THE BLOOD
THAT SPATTERED

14:57.429 --> 14:59.365
FROZE WHEN IT
HIT THE SNOW.

14:59.431 --> 15:02.434
AND THE KILLER
SCOOPED IT UP
IN HANDFULS.

15:02.501 --> 15:05.304
YOU REMEMBER STUFF
FROM WHEN YOU
WERE A KID,

15:05.371 --> 15:08.173
BUT YOU CAN'T
REMEMBER WHO
SHOT YA ?

15:11.076 --> 15:13.679
THE SECOND ONE...

15:13.746 --> 15:15.314
... RAN.

15:15.381 --> 15:18.651
YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

15:18.717 --> 15:21.120
HE ONLY GOT
ABOUT 30 FEET.

15:21.186 --> 15:24.290
THE ATTACKER BROUGHT
HIM DOWN WITH SUCH FORCE

15:24.356 --> 15:27.426
THAT THE NECK
WAS SEVERED.

15:27.493 --> 15:30.396
AND THE BODY
DRAINED OF BLOOD.

15:31.797 --> 15:34.300
BUT HOW WOULD YOU
KNOW THAT, DETECTIVE ?

15:34.366 --> 15:35.934
HEY, TWITCH.

15:36.001 --> 15:38.604
I THINK YOU NEED TO
GO WARM UP IN THE CAR.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.373
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT TWITCH.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.209
HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN
HAVING THESE VISIONS ?

15:44.276 --> 15:46.512
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, VISIONS ?

15:46.578 --> 15:48.647
THE GUY'S THE BEST
COP ON THE FORCE.

15:48.714 --> 15:51.817
LOOK, SOME FREAK IN A
RED CAPE SHOT MY PARTNER

15:51.884 --> 15:53.452
AND HE'S PROBABLY
RESPONSIBLE

15:53.519 --> 15:55.688
FOR THESE TWO HEAPS
OF GROUND ROUNDS.

15:55.754 --> 15:57.323
I DON'T THINK
HE DID THIS.

16:27.186 --> 16:28.821
YOU WERE RIGHT.

16:28.887 --> 16:30.656
THE BODIES
WERE LICKED CLEAN

16:30.723 --> 16:32.424
AND DRAINED OF BLOOD.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.626
JESUS, THAT'S
NOT EVEN HUMAN.

16:34.693 --> 16:37.596
THE KILLER
WASN'T HUMAN.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.231
HEY, KNOCK OFF THE
HORROR MOVIE STUFF,

16:39.298 --> 16:40.566
WILL YA ?

16:40.632 --> 16:42.468
THE CORONER SITES TEARS
ON THE CHEST AND NECK

16:42.534 --> 16:44.036
AS CLAW MARKS,

16:44.103 --> 16:46.472
SO DEEP THEY TORE OUT
ONE MAN'S RIB CAGE.

16:46.538 --> 16:48.774
THEIR BLOOD WAS CONSUMED
WHERE THEY WERE KILLED.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.310
SOUNDS LIKE A BIG CAT
OR A WOLF.

16:51.377 --> 16:53.712
MAYBE AN ANIMAL
GOT LOOSE.

16:53.779 --> 16:55.914
WE'LL CHECK THE ZOOS.

16:55.981 --> 16:58.550
IT'S NOT A WOLF, SIR.

16:58.617 --> 17:01.720
I KEEP SEEING HIM
IN MY MIND.

17:01.787 --> 17:06.158
HE HAD GREEN EYES,
I REMEMBER HIS CLAWS.

17:06.225 --> 17:08.494
YOU DIDN'T USE TO
TALK WEIRD LIKE THIS !

17:08.560 --> 17:11.263
YOU WERE THE MOST
STRAIGHT-ARROW COP I EVER MET.

17:11.330 --> 17:15.033
I DON'T BLAME YOU, SIR,
IF YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ME.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.502
GO HOME, TWITCH.

17:16.568 --> 17:18.437
YOU NEED TO GET
A LITTLE REST.

17:18.504 --> 17:20.105
YES, SIR.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.611
( club music blasting )

17:37.790 --> 17:39.525
( moaning )

17:49.935 --> 17:51.703
OOH, BABY.

17:51.770 --> 17:52.738
AHH !

17:52.805 --> 17:54.840
GET AWAY FROM HIM.

17:57.276 --> 18:00.045
YOUR KIND HAS
ALWAYS DISGUSTED ME.

18:00.112 --> 18:02.247
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.783
I'VE HEARD ALL
ABOUT YOU.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.785
YOU'RE JADE.

18:06.852 --> 18:07.953
THE OTHER HUNTERS,

18:08.020 --> 18:09.488
THEY TOLD ME TO
WATCH OUT FOR YOU.

18:09.555 --> 18:11.423
IF YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR,
AND THE BOY IS DEAD,

18:11.490 --> 18:13.192
I'M SANCTIONED
TO TAKE YOU.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.093
HE'LL BE OKAY.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.929
HE LOOKS LIKE
A SWEET BOY.

18:16.995 --> 18:19.932
BUT HE'S LIKE THE REST,
HE JUST WANTED SEX.

18:19.998 --> 18:21.633
THOSE TWO THUGS
IN THE ALLEY,

18:21.700 --> 18:25.337
YOU LED THEM THERE AND
THEN YOU RIPPED THEM OPEN.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.239
I WAS HUNGRY,

18:27.306 --> 18:28.674
AND THOSE PIGS TRIED
TO TURN ME OUT

18:28.740 --> 18:30.008
LIKE A CHEAP WHORE.

18:30.075 --> 18:31.710
THE COPS WILL THINK
IT'S THE HELL SPAWN.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.112
I WANT HIM TO KNOW
I'M COMING FOR HIM NEXT.

18:34.179 --> 18:36.014
YOU HAVE NO LICENSE
TO HUNT HIM.

18:36.081 --> 18:39.051
ONLY BOUNTY HUNTERS
HAVE THAT RIGHT.

18:39.117 --> 18:42.020
YEAH, WELL, THE MASTERS
WERE GONNA KICK ME OUT,

18:42.087 --> 18:45.357
BUT WHEN THEY SAW
THAT YOU HADN'T TAKEN OUT

18:45.424 --> 18:46.758
THE NEW HELL SPAWN,

18:46.825 --> 18:48.760
THEY OFFERED
ME A DEAL.

18:48.827 --> 18:51.697
ONE LAST CHANCE
TO PROVE MYSELF.

18:51.763 --> 18:53.999
OH...

18:54.066 --> 18:56.068
THEY DIDN'T
TELL YOU THAT.

18:56.134 --> 18:58.770
YOU'RE A VICIOUS
LITTLE BITCH.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.672
NO WONDER THE MASTERS
THREW YOU OUT.

19:00.739 --> 19:02.508
I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS.

19:02.574 --> 19:05.210
I WAS RAPED AND TORN
OPEN BY A HELL SPAWN.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.913
SO DON'T PREACH TO ME.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.282
THERE IS A WAY
TO TRACK A HELL SPAWN.

19:10.349 --> 19:13.519
YOU ACT FOOLISHLY,
HE WILL FINISH YOU.

19:13.585 --> 19:16.088
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF

19:16.154 --> 19:18.123
IF HEAVEN WON'T
TAKE ME BACK,

19:18.190 --> 19:20.959
THERE'S ALWAYS HELL.

19:33.572 --> 19:34.940
A PRETTY GIRL
LIKE YOU

19:35.007 --> 19:38.043
SHOULDN'T BE OUT HERE
IN THESE MEAN STREETS.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.979
COME OVER HERE.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.682
I'M NOT GONNA
BITE YOU.

19:43.749 --> 19:45.384
C'MON, BABY,
IT'S COLD OUT HERE.

19:45.450 --> 19:46.785
I LIKE IT COLD.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.021
I SAW WHAT WAS LEFT OF
THE TWO GUYS YOU WERE WITH.

19:49.087 --> 19:51.423
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHO KILLED THEM.

19:51.490 --> 19:54.393
I THINK YOU
WERE THERE.

19:54.459 --> 19:56.128
I WAS THERE.

19:56.194 --> 19:58.430
I HEARD THE FUCKING
LITTLE PIGS SQUEAL

19:58.497 --> 20:00.432
WHEN THEY WERE
RIPPED OPEN.

20:02.067 --> 20:04.036
WHAT DID YOU THINK ?

20:04.102 --> 20:06.171
YOU WERE GONNA
BE SAFE FROM ME

20:06.238 --> 20:08.774
HIDING IN THIS
SHIT-HOLE CHURCH ?

20:10.609 --> 20:12.110
AHH !

20:14.079 --> 20:16.682
NO ONE'S GONNA
WANT YOU NOW.

20:16.748 --> 20:19.351
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
YOU'RE GOOD FOR.

20:19.418 --> 20:22.521
I'M GONNA PUT YOUR ASS
ON THE STREET, BITCH.

20:22.588 --> 20:24.089
WITH A CUT FACE,

20:24.156 --> 20:26.058
I PROBABLY WON'T GET
AS MUCH MONEY FOR YOU.

20:26.124 --> 20:30.228
BUT YOU'RE MINE !
I OWN YOU !

20:39.538 --> 20:43.175
( choking )

20:53.151 --> 20:55.253
WHAT ARE YOU ?

21:05.831 --> 21:08.367
TELL ME WHO YOU ARE !

21:34.793 --> 21:36.561
DO YOU SLEEP
IN HERE,

21:36.628 --> 21:39.197
WITH THESE BONES ?

21:39.264 --> 21:43.201
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN LIKE THIS ?

21:43.268 --> 21:45.270
YEARS.

21:45.337 --> 21:47.639
I DON'T LIKE TO THINK
ABOUT THAT TIME.

21:47.706 --> 21:51.176
I WEAR THESE CLOTHES
SO I CAN REMEMBER WHAT I WAS,

21:51.243 --> 21:53.745
BEFORE I HAD
THE HUNGER.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.248
I MUST
LOOK SO UGLY.

21:56.314 --> 21:58.684
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.891
I'M JUST
LIKE YOU.

22:05.957 --> 22:08.727
THEY MADE ME INTO
A MONSTER, TOO.

22:08.794 --> 22:09.861
WHO ?

22:09.928 --> 22:11.396
ONE LIKE YOU.

22:11.463 --> 22:13.331
SENT FROM MALEBOLGIA.

22:13.398 --> 22:16.635
HOW DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT ME ?

22:16.702 --> 22:20.605
I WILL TAKE MY
REVENGE, HELL SPAWN.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.941
STARTING WITH YOU.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.277
YOU WERE SENT
BY THEM ?!

22:56.475 --> 22:58.910
HEAVEN SENT A GIRL
TO KILL ME ?!

22:58.977 --> 23:01.113
IS THIS THE BEST
THEY CAN DO ?!

23:57.903 --> 24:00.005
WHAT KIND OF HEAVEN,

24:00.071 --> 24:02.107
SENDS A CREATURE
LIKE YOU ?!

24:02.174 --> 24:05.610
ALL THE RULES HAVE
CHANGED, HELL SPAWN.

24:05.677 --> 24:07.546
HEAVEN WANTS TO WIN.

24:18.089 --> 24:20.425
AHHH !

24:42.380 --> 24:44.316
AHH !

25:03.735 --> 25:05.704

YOU'RE NOT LIKE
THE OTHERS.

25:19.484 --> 25:22.153
I'M A SOLDIER
LIKE YOU.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.489
WE HAVE OUR DUTY.

25:24.556 --> 25:26.958
YOU THINK YOU CAN
TAKE MY HEAD

25:27.025 --> 25:30.295
THE WAY YOU TOOK
THE OTHERS ?

25:30.362 --> 25:32.397
COME AND TAKE ME.

25:32.464 --> 25:35.600
I WANT YOU
TO BE STRONG...

25:35.667 --> 25:38.637
... WHEN I COME
BACK FOR YOU.

26:30.889 --> 26:33.158
FOR THIS HELL SPAWN,

26:33.224 --> 26:35.193
THE CREATURES
OF THE DARK

26:35.260 --> 26:37.162
HAVE NOURISHED HIM.

26:37.228 --> 26:40.098
EVIL HAS
STRENGTHENED HIM

26:40.165 --> 26:42.567
AND RESTORED
HIS POWER.
